[00:08:01] <mindis|wurk> i sometimes see people maniacally push the use of .html() instead of .append or .appendTo. is it really so bad to use the latter two?
[00:08:20] <DerStoffel> Good Morning
[00:09:27] <DreamStiffler> guten tag
[00:09:47] <rue> Happy Easter!
[00:10:02] <Cork> mindis|wurk: depends on what you want to do
[00:10:26] <Cork> mindis|wurk: html is preferable if you want to replace the content
[00:10:40] <mindis|wurk> what if you wanted to add something?
[00:10:49] <Cork> use append
[00:11:08] <Cork> else you would have to convert the old dom tree to html, add your html, then parse it all back to dom again
[00:11:23] <Cork> append is just appendChild
[00:13:48] <mindis|wurk> i'd imagine prepending isn't any more expensive then
[00:41:11] <Zogot> http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/fw7wt/ If anyone has any ideas to get the icons that slide out to stay that would be great.  I think I may need to change it quite a bit, but maybe theres a simple solution or so?
[00:42:50] <Cork> Zogot: put the icons as children to #logo
[00:43:27] <Zogot> It's gonna be putting them in the H1 tag though, wont that mess a bit with robots?
[00:43:33] <Cork> and then use mouseenter on #logo instead of hover
[00:43:42] <Cork> Zogot: no not in the h1
[00:43:55] <Zogot> oh i get ya, make a containing div, move the logo to the H1
[00:43:58] <Cork> add a wrapper around the h1 tag
[00:43:59] <Zogot> and make the mouseover on the div
[00:44:12] <Cork> mouseenter not mouseover
[00:44:15] <mindis|wurk> i've learned to hate mouseenter and mouseleave
[00:44:19] <Cork> ?.mouseenter
[00:44:19] <bot-t> .mouseenter(handler): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse enters an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
[00:45:22] <Cork> mindis|wurk: it actaully has its user casesm though they'r argubly few :)
[00:45:22] <Cork> *cases
[00:45:23] <Zogot> Problem is also though, that the elements are absolutely positioned
[00:45:32] <Zogot> so the div doesn't wrap around them
[00:45:40] <Zogot> without specify the constraints i guess
[00:46:15] <Cork> Zogot: so make the parent position: relative
[00:46:16] <Zogot> I think that'll fudge the position of the icons though, but I'll try it now and respond back
[00:47:17] <mindis|wurk> Cork my main gripe with them is that they don't always work
[00:47:32] <Cork> uh. what?
[00:47:39] <mindis|wurk> sometimes mouseleave just won't trigger
[00:47:51] <Cork> never seen that
[00:48:11] <Cork> mindis|wurk: btw do you mean mouseleave or mouseout?
[00:48:16] <mindis|wurk> leave
[00:49:00] <mindis|wurk> sometimes enter and leave can also trigger almost simultaneously
[00:49:27] <Cork> sure
[00:49:44] <Cork> but thats cause focus can do that
[00:49:58] <QbY> The chances that I have done something incredibly wrong are great…  However, can someone tell me why when I enter a text box its not clearing the default value out?
[00:50:00] <QbY> http://pastebin.com/T7KKZq8s
[00:50:03] <Cork> well hover actaully
[00:50:23] <Cork> ?p @ QbY
[00:50:23] <bot-t> QbY, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:50:34] <Cork> not a static pb
[00:50:51] <QbY> Here you go.. http://jsfiddle.net/yKe3x/
[00:53:05] <Cork> fixed up so its valid http://jsfiddle.net/yKe3x/1/
[00:59:29] <imc> why I see 'return this.each( function () { ... } ); ' in jquery modules? why this.each ( function instead of just function ?
[01:00:06] <DreamStiffler> omg coding kills
[01:00:18] <DreamStiffler> Eviltwin: you stilla round?
[01:01:03] <kakeman> every line you write you are dying bit by bit?
[01:01:53] <DreamStiffler> braincells braincells
[01:01:55] <DreamStiffler> i need moarr
[01:02:13] <DreamStiffler> can you help me out since this is my 2nd day in jquery and 4th in js
[01:02:24] <DreamStiffler> before that just html
[01:02:31] <QbY> thank you cork
[01:03:11] <Cork> QbY: its only a fixup to make it work in jsfiddle
[01:03:16] <Cork> i'm still working on a fix :)
[01:03:16] <QbY> oh
[01:03:18] <QbY> k.
[01:03:34] <Cork> its done... it just messes with me right now
[01:04:04] <QbY> ?
[01:04:26] <DreamStiffler> ok my jquery is this..which is almost what i want. cept i want to use this results and do a join. something like Eviltwin mentioned earlier .map() .get() and .join() . the thin is i dont quite et .map() so i used .each(instead). heres my code: $(e).closest("td").nextAll().each(function() {	alert('each : ' + $(this).text());	});
[01:04:31] <jac0bz1> I have a wierd problem with jQuery UI and the droppable.. In the drop and deactive event I log the event "dropping" and "canceling". The droppable() is executed after an ajax load. Now the console says: canceling - canceling - canceling - dropping - canceling
[01:04:50] <jac0bz1> so its executed four times!
[01:04:52] <jac0bz1> ?
[01:04:56] <jac0bz1> I dont understand this
[01:05:20] <imc> jac0bz1: js errors on ajax response
[01:05:24] <DreamStiffler> so how do i get all these alerts data and and print it out on console log like this a1 , b1 , c2 etc.
[01:05:43] <imc> firebug : net > xhr, check the response, manually replay returned js in firebug console
[01:05:48] <imc> you'll see why
[01:05:49] <DreamStiffler> !help dying
[01:06:02] <imc> (i.e. js repeats the ajax request if running response fails)
[01:07:18] <jac0bz1> imc: I dont have any errors on the ajax response
[01:07:20] <Cork> QbY: http://jsfiddle.net/yKe3x/3/
[01:07:36] <jac0bz1> is there a way to destroy the droppable? like die() works on live() ?
[01:07:39] <imc> jac0bz1: not in the ajax response, but running the ajax response
[01:07:39] <Cork> gah... forgot to restore the support check
[01:07:45] <imc> just to be clear
[01:07:58] <Cork> QbY: if($.support.placeholder) { should be if(!$.support.placeholder) {
[01:08:01] <kaolti> Hey guys!
[01:08:12] <QbY> ok
[01:08:24] <imc> it's quite easy to see if you're having the problem i describe : you'll see 3-4 ajax requests from browser to server
[01:08:54] <imc> (can be cause by other errors in client code, but most of the time it's the faulty response the cause)
[01:08:55] <kaolti> Im trying to create a menu with animation on hover, but the hover is only triggered when the mouse is on the actual text, not the whole <li> container
[01:08:59] <Cork> QbY: it uses the html5 placeholder, and the script is to implement the same for browser that doesn't support it
[01:09:13] <QbY> gotcha
[01:09:18] <QbY> tesitng
[01:09:22] <kaolti> is there any workaround or do I have to set a background-color?
[01:09:32] <QbY> beautiful
[01:09:34] <Cork> QbY: and if you check in farly modern browsers, only ie needs it :)
[01:09:35] <QbY> thank you
[01:09:39] <Cork> np
[01:09:58] <Zogot> Got it to work: http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/fw7wt/
[01:09:59] <DreamStiffler> anybody somebody help me.. i was so close since yesterday but my script kept changing
[01:10:17] <DreamStiffler> and now its so close but not sure how to do it
[01:10:23] <Cork> QbY: don't forget to add a css rule for .placeholder
[01:10:30] <imc> DreamStiffler: use git for <whatever> sake
[01:10:31] <QbY> k..
[01:10:36] <QbY> it seems to work perfectly right now
[01:10:54] <Cork> QbY: in browsers that has placeholder support by default
[01:10:55] <imc> (or any other modern version control system)
[01:11:26] <Cork> QbY: change the if statement back to $.support.placeholder, and you see how it looks in those that don't
[01:11:57] <Cork> all it needs is some css color
[01:11:58] <QbY> k.. i gotta fire up my virtual machine for IE
[01:12:05] <QbY> actually its perfect as is
[01:12:28] <Cork> this is actually quite close to what i wrote for my self a few days ago :)
[01:12:30] <DreamStiffler> git?
[01:12:48] <Cork> (well more like a week)
[01:13:27] <Cork> QbY: it has one limitation though, the fallback fails for password fields
[01:13:38] <Cork> (as thoughs will have dots instead)
[01:13:45] <jac0bz1> imc: I think you missunderstood me.. I first load a table with Ajax. Then I init a drag/drop function. The drop event dont do anything else then write a message to the console. but it runs 4 times...
[01:13:53] <QbY> Hey Cork see your PM
[01:14:09] <Cork> uh, i have +g
[01:14:30] <Cork> so no pm's
[01:14:30] <imc> jac0bz1: ok, then it's not what i described
[01:14:34] <imc> jac0bz1: place breakpoints
[01:14:57] <QbY> Cork: No biggie, was just saying thanks again for bailing me out and offering you a free subscription if you lived in the US
[01:15:14] <imc> jac0bz1: i'm not an expert js programmer (very far from that), but i've read about getting the caller of the function in some way...
[01:15:24] <Cork> QbY: lol np, and no i don't
[01:15:34] <imc> but probably any debugger can show you the stack trace at any breakpoint... this should help you
[01:16:02] <jac0bz1> I have placed alot of break points.. the only thing I can think of is that either the droppable options (I've added them as seperate vars) or the droppable init is multiplied somewhere.. But I cant see it in any of the breaking points
[01:16:58] <imc> try to think of something else then
[01:17:06] <imc> i.e. take a break yourself
[01:17:09] <Staley> Hi i have come across a strange problem after updating to jquery 1.7.1, i have an application that gets jsonp responses and shows them in the browser but after updating it isnt shown anymore, i see that response is aquired but not shown
[01:17:40] <Staley> the only difference i see is that the callback parameter is changed
[01:18:02] <jac0bz1> :)

[01:21:12] <Staley> does anyone have some suggestion on how to fix this
[01:25:14] <Zogot> ok, new bug, http://leon.rowland.nl/ mouse in and out real quick, and the icons start moving in the opposite directory
[01:25:17] <Zogot> direction*
[01:25:44] <Cork> ?.stop
[01:25:44] <bot-t> .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/

[01:26:06] <kaolti> i don't think thats a bug
[01:26:15] <Zogot> It is using stop
[01:26:16] <Zogot> http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/fw7wt/
[01:26:51] <Cork> Zogot: right:'+='+value
[01:26:53] <kaolti> is there a way to add the same element multiple times in multiple places with insertAfter() ?
[01:27:04] <Cork> Zogot: that will go from where it was stoped
[01:27:15] <Cork> not from its original position
[01:29:04] <Zogot> oh, its a simple fix

[01:31:50] <Staley> no, i think that will be hard
[01:33:51] <Staley> i cant understand why the callback parameter looks like it looks after update
[01:35:43] <kaolti> guys can I add a .separator element multiple times with insertAfter ?
[01:35:49] <kaolti> or will it be moved around
[01:36:54] <Cork> depends how you refer to it
[01:37:03] <Cork> as a dom object, not it will be moved
[01:37:08] <Cork> as html yes it will work
[01:37:20] <Cork> if its a dom object use ?.clone
[01:37:20] <bot-t> .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[01:37:42] <xec> Staley: jquery returns jqXHR rather than a native xhr as of 1.5 - but i haven't seen that break anything before
[01:37:55] <kaolti> how do i refer to it as html?
[01:38:27] <Cork> .insertAfter('<span class="separator"></span>')
[01:38:37] <Cork> opps but the other way around :)
[01:38:49] <kaolti> thanks Cork!
[01:38:54] <Cork> np
[01:39:27] <Staley> xec: do you know what i could do?

[01:53:33] <MACscr> im getting an error in the firebug console when trying to assign some json array values to form fields: says "invalid label" and then shows the json array. Any ideas what its talking about? what label is is talking about?
[01:57:47] <Cork> MACscr: you can't add values to a json
[01:57:56] <Cork> unless your contacting the string
[01:58:06] <MACscr> no, im getting the values from json
[01:58:23] <Cork> so its just an array?
[01:58:30] <MACscr> yep
[01:58:55] <Cork> how are you adding the falues?
[01:59:35] <Cork> *values
[02:05:57] <MACscr> Cork: here is the js http://jsfiddle.net/MAy5x/
[02:07:17] <jac0bz1> In the "helper" event within the draggable() i create the droppable like this: $("#thefiletree li a").droppable(dropOpts); The problem is that this is created X amount of times (Where X = number of A's in #thefiletree)  Is this correct? Cuz its messing up my code
[02:08:37] <Cork> MACscr: that looks more like an object then an array
[02:08:51] <Cork> MACscr: what is it you want to do?
[02:11:07] <MACscr> i want to solve the error so i goes back to working again? =P
[02:11:17] <MACscr> not really sure what the error means
[02:11:36] <Cork> MACscr: how am i suppose to tell when i don't know what your working with
[02:11:45] <Cork> or what row is throwin the error
[02:12:19] <Cork> you need to make sure to include all the relevant data to be able to help you
[02:13:29] <xec> the error is obviously on line 2: there is no element in the html matching $(".get_user")
[02:19:09] <MACscr> xec: ha. Want me to post a sample object that is returned?
[02:27:44] <Cork> MACscr: we need to see the json yes
[02:27:56] <Cork> and what line in the code you posted that throws the error
[02:29:51] <MACscr> unfortunately it doesnt specify a line, its just http://screencast.com/t/olznfcUyiLke
[02:30:23] <aidan___> anyone got a solution for rounded corners in ie7?
[02:30:33] <ravenzz> MACscr what is that?

[02:30:40] <MACscr> better http://screencast.com/t/olznfcUyiLke
[02:30:52] <ravenzz> aidan___ css3 pie
[02:31:44] <MACscr> well, what does invalid label mean? that object looks fine
[02:32:11] <Cork> MACscr: goto jsfiddle, reproduce the error there
[02:32:22] <Cork> that means make it throw the same error there too
[02:32:29] <Cork> THEN we can help you
[02:32:29] <ravenzz> MACscr I am not familiar with firebug
[02:33:22] <Cork> invalid label means... that your using something as a label that isn't valid as a label
[02:33:34] <ravenzz> ,"first_n...src",
[02:33:37] <Cork> to be able to tell what that is, needs more info
[02:33:38] <ravenzz> perhaps?
[02:34:14] <MACscr> ravenzz: eh, thats just firebug being stupid and shortening the line. You can see above that its fine
[02:34:16] <ravenzz> or is that a shortened string
[02:34:20] <ravenzz> ok
[02:36:32] <Cork> ravenzz: the ... is just that the output is shortned
[02:36:33] <ravenzz> MACscr i can't help you then
[02:36:50] <ravenzz> Cork yep, I got it
[02:52:43] <DreamStiffler> ok i have something like this
[02:53:38] <DreamStiffler> problem is i dont want to use .append() since it will append it to the html. but instead i want it only to appear in the return set. how do i do this?

[02:54:07] <coldhead> what the hell is this, Sircan
[02:56:45] <jac0bz1> I have a droppable: $("#foo li a").droppable(); but when i drop objects in one, all the other "a" elements returns the deactivate event... ?
[02:58:09] <jac0bz1> is there a way to set $("ul#foo") as th droppable, and within that set that the A's are the dropzone?
[03:02:56] <antdillon> Hi, does anyone know how to apply :hover to a element without using a hover class in css?
[03:03:14] <nFFF> DreamStiffler, what do you mean in the return set?
[03:03:35] <nFFF> antdillon, focus()
[03:04:49] <antdillon> nFFF, thanks but that did apply the hover styles
[03:05:16] <antdillon> mouseover() runs the mouseover functions but doesnt apply :hover to the element
[03:05:34] <nFFF> I don't understand.. what are you trying to do?
[03:05:48] <nFFF> you want to add a class to the element on mouse over?
[03:06:33] <antdillon> I have a div with :hover styles
[03:06:59] <nFFF> ok
[03:07:01] <antdillon> im trying to apply the style with jquery
[03:07:26] <DreamStiffler> nFFF: i mean i want to display the result in console.log . by using .append it adds to the html design. i tried using .add also...but didnt work
[03:07:27] <antdillon> so click somewhere else which add :hover to the div
[03:07:46] <nFFF> click where though?
[03:07:55] <nFFF> Becuase there's a .css() function
[03:08:31] <antdillon> nFFF, I have a click function on a div that I want to set :hover to another div
[03:09:05] <nFFF> Sure
[03:09:08] <antdillon> nFFF, I would use the css() but its dynamic so chould be a few different elements
[03:10:00] <nFFF> $('element').click(function() { $('otherelement').addClass('clicked); });
[03:10:22] <nFFF> DreamStiffler
[03:10:42] <nFFF> $(this).append(" | ").text() ;
[03:10:52] <nFFF> This will append to the current element
[03:10:54] <nFFF> not console.log
[03:10:58] <antdillon> nFFF, Yea thats how I can get it working, but hoped I wouldnt have to go through and add clicked classes to the css
[03:11:25] <antdillon> nFFF, figured jQuery could apply the :hover to the element
[03:11:38] <nFFF> antdillon, your not making sense :hover is a selector
[03:11:58] <nFFF> element:hover {} and element.clicked { }
[03:12:01] <nFFF> whats the difference?
[03:12:57] <antdillon> nFFF, sorry, just through mouseover() would apply the hover styles to an element
[03:13:19] <antdillon> nFFF, wondered if there was a way to do that
[03:13:20] <xec> antdillon: do you have control over the css?
[03:13:32] <antdillon> xec, Yea sure
[03:13:53] <nFFF> So jsut add a class
[03:13:56] <xec> antdillon: then i would change the selector in css, add a class
[03:13:59] <xec> right
[03:14:05] <antdillon> xec, wanted to avoid adding .hover classes instead of :hover
[03:14:11] <xec> antdillon: do both
[03:14:24] <antdillon> xec, if thats the only way then fair enough I'll get on with it
[03:14:41] <nFFF> Whats the negative of adding a class opposed to :hover ?
[03:14:55] <xec> antdillon: i don't know any way you can apply :hover styles without actually hovering your cursor over the element..
[03:14:57] <antdillon> xec, Thanks, I thought that was the only solution, was hoping there was a function for it
[03:15:10] <antdillon> xec, Thanks again
[03:15:25] <DreamStiffler> nFFF: ok i know it will append to the elememt so what are you suggesting
[03:15:56] <nFFF> DreamStiffler, pass console.log a variable that contains all the data
[03:16:46] <nFFF> What you seem to be trying to do doesn't make sense
[03:17:14] <nFFF> instead of $(this),
[03:17:17] <nFFF> use a variable
[03:17:25] <nFFF> and then console.log(var);
[03:17:37] <amitprakash_> How do I pass a callback argument to a jquery function .. ex x = this; $($(x).siblings()[0]).slideUp( function( x) { //do something with x; ... })
[03:25:20] <hurry> hi, if i load a page with $.ajax(), when it is loaded, how can i show one specific div that is inside the page loaded?
[03:25:31] <amitprakash_> Hmm.. $($(x).siblings()[0]).slideUp( function(){ //do something with x }(x)); seems to work.. any ideas why?
[03:25:45] <nFFF> hurry, look into .load()
[03:25:55] <nFFF> .load(url .class)
[03:26:00] <hurry> but like this, i load two times the same page
[03:26:13] <nFFF> Don't use .ajax
[03:26:17] <nFFF> use .load instead
[03:26:23] <nFFF> And load the specific element
[03:26:33] <hurry> ok, the one question simple when use ajax and when use load?
[03:26:39] <amitprakash_> nFFF, any ideas about why the 2nd callback works?
[03:26:42] <hurry> yes i write this $('#gallery').load('Get_user #container');
[03:26:55] <hurry> and works, but inside the ajax, i call get_user two times
[03:27:01] <amitprakash_> hurry, use $.ajax when you want ajax calls .. use .load when you want response to show up in some div/block
[03:27:16] <nFFF> amitprakash_, what second callback?
[03:27:31] <hurry> ok thanks guys very kind
[03:27:33] <nFFF> Your basically issue is your trying to console.log(); a bunch of jQuery that doesn't return anyhting to log
[03:28:14] <amitprakash_> nFFF, umm no.. nFFF, $($(x).siblings()[0]).slideUp( function(){ //do something with x }(x)); i wonder why I have to pass (x) to the callback function the way it has been passed instead of passing it as a function argument
[03:28:29] <xec> amitprakash_: you don't ?
[03:28:49] <xec> amitprakash_: i don't quite get the question.. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[03:28:53] <nFFF> amitprakash_ sorry wrong guy
[03:28:54] <xec> sorry mispaste
[03:28:58] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/5kspW/
[03:29:04] <nFFF> thought you were DreamStiffler :P
[03:29:08] <amitprakash_> heh
[03:29:15] <amitprakash_> xec, I don't what?
[03:29:35] <xec> amitprakash_: you were wondering why you needed to do (x) at end of your function
[03:29:57] <amitprakash_> hmm
[03:30:01] <Mosselmaniac> hi all
[03:30:04] <Mosselmaniac> why does this not work?
[03:30:05] <Mosselmaniac> http://pastebin.com/kW2LeXyS
[03:30:09] <amitprakash_> xec, isn't x global there?
[03:30:15] <Mosselmaniac> in my PHP i get an EMPTY post array??
[03:30:20] <nFFF> Mosselmaniac, jsfiddle.net
[03:30:36] <xec> amitprakash_: well, almost - its actually inside a doc ready
[03:31:19] <Mosselmaniac> nFFF: you can't get server side stuff there?
[03:31:23] <Mosselmaniac> i mean, this must be simple...
[03:31:33] <Mosselmaniac> i'm willing to post the whole form there, use serialize()?
[03:31:42] <xec> ?serialize @ Mosselmaniac
[03:31:43] <bot-t> Mosselmaniac, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[03:32:18] <Mosselmaniac> xec: i tried that
[03:32:32] <Mosselmaniac> $("#svg_form").serialize() but still no post data?
[03:32:42] <nFFF> true
[03:32:50] <xec> Mosselmaniac: can you make a quick demo? see ?demo
[03:32:51] <bot-t> Mosselmaniac, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:32:56] <amitprakash_> xec, thanks.. how stupid of me.. trying to pass something that I don't even need to
[03:33:14] <nFFF> $("#svg_form").serialize(true); ?
[03:33:45] <Mosselmaniac> not owkring
[03:34:04] <Mosselmaniac> i mean, i get my alert box, but in firebug it does not post anything
[03:34:58] <hurry> if i want do a query that delete one row in database, i must use $.ajax() right?
[03:35:36] <nFFF> Mosselmaniac, not even 'Yes'?
[03:36:26] <xec> Mosselmaniac: do you get an empty post request, or no post request?
[03:36:34] <Mosselmaniac> nFFF: no
[03:36:39] <Mosselmaniac> empty post request
[03:37:17] <xec> Mosselmaniac: can you post your new code, the one actually using serialize
[03:37:44] <sahbeewah> move the script block below the form
[03:38:07] <xec> good point sahbeewah
[03:38:30] <Mosselmaniac> did that now
[03:39:01] <Mosselmaniac> that thing is empty
[03:39:13] <xec> "that thing"?
[03:39:27] <Mosselmaniac> post request
[03:39:30] <Mosselmaniac> if i do: data:  "test",
[03:39:55] <Mosselmaniac> then i see as "Parameter" in firebug: test
[03:40:02] <Mosselmaniac> although my $_POST is empty
[03:40:27] <norbert_> hey all, I'm hoping that maybe someone here has a solution for an issue I ran into: I'm trying to do this, but for some reason it's not working: $('#' . element_id, window.parent.document).load("test.php");
[03:40:48] <xec> Mosselmaniac: and if you do data: "a=test"
[03:41:10] <norbert_> I run that from a fancybox pop-up, and when I do a regular window.parent.document.getElementById(element_id).innerHTML = 'test'; it does work
[03:41:14] <Mosselmaniac> xec: then it works. nice.
[03:41:15] <nFFF> norbert_, try +
[03:41:22] <norbert_> ah crap
[03:41:26] <norbert_> nFFF: thanks
[03:41:27] <nFFF> PHP ? :>>
[03:41:32] <norbert_> yeah
[03:41:35] <norbert_> thanks
[03:41:50] <norbert_> sometimes things are easy but you've been staring at it for too long :)
[03:42:00] <nFFF> Thats my life story ha
[03:42:07] <Mosselmaniac> so now i want to post that form data
[03:42:33] <Mosselmaniac> or even better: chart.getSVG() (which returns SVG xml)
[03:42:55] <xec> Mosselmaniac: use xml as datatype if you want to pass xml
[03:43:28] <Mosselmaniac> then just
[03:43:37] <Mosselmaniac> data: "a="+chart.getSVG(), ?
[03:45:04] <nFFF> Anyone used new firefox developer tools?
[03:45:34] <Mosselmaniac> xec?
[03:45:46] <xec> Mosselmaniac: no
[03:46:17] <Mosselmaniac> i'm going to store the svg data in a database, so a string is fine?
[03:46:18] <xec> Mosselmaniac: if getSVG returns xml, you drop the "a="+ part and set dataType: "xml"
[03:46:25] <pashmi56> hi there,  i have one custom hover function, works fine, by clicking an element i am unbinding it by: .unbind('mouseenter').unbind('mouseleave') and then I wand rebind afterward, rebind does not work, do you have any ideaS?
[03:47:00] <xec> Mosselmaniac: i suspect the xml data will contain characters that will confuse a querystring
[03:48:36] <nFFF> pashmi56, what are you trying to do, perhaps there's a better way of doing this
[03:48:50] <nFFF> jsfiddle.net
[03:49:14] <chee> nFFF: yes!
[03:49:21] <Mosselmaniac> xec: me too
[03:49:26] <chee> i have
[03:49:34] <chee> nFFF: it is like being in charge of a spaceship!
[03:50:10] <xec> lol, i want a spaceship too!
[03:50:23] <Mosselmaniac> xec: i have a question
[03:50:23] <nFFF> :>>
[03:50:37] <Mosselmaniac> how can i access that xml then in my PHP? because it has no name?
[03:50:43] <xec> where do i find these new tools they speak of
[03:50:56] <Mosselmaniac> furthermore, the Code Igniter framework sais: "Disallowed key characters" when i do it that way
[03:51:21] <pashmi56> nFFF:http://jsfiddle.net/QwRFG/  this is code i have. ok I have a box hovering on it shows hide and show inner box. clicking on the inner box launches shadowbox. but when i move my mouse (becuase it hover out) hides the showbox
[03:51:46] <xec> Mosselmaniac: i don't know what code igniter is, and haven't used php in years - maybe ##php can help you receive xml on the server side
[03:52:00] <Mosselmaniac> thx
[03:52:20] <nFFF> pashmi56, use a class than
[03:52:23] <nFFF> instead of hover
[03:52:30] <nFFF> and use focus() to addClass()
[03:53:03] <pashmi56> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/QwRFG/1/   sorry i dont understand what do you mean!
[03:53:51] <nFFF> Sec misread your issue
[03:55:22] <nFFF> You havbe abox, hovering on it shows hide?
[03:55:25] <nFFF> What does that mean
[03:55:59] <nFFF> So basically, you want to when click remove the hover
[03:57:21] <nFFF> You havent even uploaded the correct html :<<
[03:57:35] <nFFF> #grid-table-container doesnt exist in the html
[03:58:25] <pashmi56> i added my html, ok there is element TD, hovering on the TD toggles a div inside it "jwbox",  clicking in the jwbox launches shadowbox. but even though shadowbox is lanched hovering out, hides the shaddowbox
[03:58:44] <antdillon> nFFF, you know of anyway of unbinding the last bind click function to an element
[03:59:01] <nFFF> antdillon ask xec :D
[03:59:17] <antdillon> I have 2 bind click functions and just want to unbind the last one?
[03:59:28] <nFFF> .unbind() ?
[03:59:45] <antdillon> that will unbind both functions right?
[04:00:30] <nFFF> antdillon, I haven't used bind, I'm guessing it would yes
[04:00:39] <nFFF> perhaps theres a function to unbind a certain click
[04:00:50] <xec> antdillon: you can cache and pass the handler to .unbind() see ?unbind
[04:00:50] <nFFF> Is there an index of clicks to can track?
[04:00:51] <bot-t> antdillon, .unbind([eventType], [handler]): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[04:00:54] <pashmi56> nfff:  sorry here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/QwRFG/3/
[04:01:36] <nFFF> ok
[04:02:18] <antdillon> bot-t, xec, nFFF  great thanks
[04:02:28] <bot-t> antdillon, Couldn't find "xec, nFFF great thanks" in jQuery Docs.
[04:02:32] <xec> hehe
[04:02:35] <xec> ?botsnack
[04:02:36] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[04:03:11] <pashmi56> nFFF: i cant pate all my html because it is CMS and header footer is missing
[04:05:54] <sahbeewah> what are you trying to do
[04:06:54] <nFFF> I'm sorry your code confuses me slightl
[04:08:04] <Jaac> Hi chaps, i've been searching the web for a plugin but couldn't find one that does what i need.
[04:08:11] <Jaac> Maybe someone knows a plugin that can do what i need.
[04:08:19] <Jaac> I'm looking for a plugin that can partially uncover a header and show something underneath when i hover a certain link or button.
[04:08:21] <pashmi56> nFFF: yeah, i think because the shadowbox js and html is not there.
[04:08:34] <nFFF> like on hover
[04:08:57] <nFFF> why the functions for the hadlnerin and out events
[04:09:09] <Jaac> Something like a peel effect or making a header partiallly transparent and thus showing a image below it.
[04:09:46] <Jaac> But the peel effect plugins i found, only work for a complete page, for example in a corner of the whole page.
[04:10:10] <nFFF> When I hover over the td it's jsut constantly sliding up and down
[04:10:19] <pashmi56> nFFF:  what?  is my my custom hover function, to toglle the jwbox
[04:10:43] <nFFF> But just hovering over it, constantly slides it up and down, is this what you wanted?
[04:10:54] <pashmi56> nFFF: yes is hovering up and down is part of the functionality i want
[04:11:32] <pashmi56> nFFF: yes- and then clickng on the jwbox launches the shadowbox.
[04:11:34] <sahbeewah> lol
[04:12:16] <pashmi56> nFFF: moving mouse on the shadowbox hides it
[04:13:57] <nFFF> ok
[04:14:43] <nFFF> And when you click it hides it
[04:14:58] <chee> 5 hours! that's plenty of time to do 2 weeks work
[04:15:11] <pashmi56> nFFF: so what i trying to do is: when the jwbox is clicked unbind the hover event, then when the showdox is closed rebind the hover
[04:16:39] <nFFF> ok
[04:16:43] <nFFF> I understand now
[04:16:58] <XeruX> I'm bindind dragover,dragend and so on to a <div> which has several child <div>s. Whenever I drag between the child divs, the events are triggered.. I only want the dragenter to trigger once. Also, dragleave triggers every time I drag over the child divs, instead of when I'm actually leaving the parent div (which dragleave and whatnot is bound to)
[04:18:44] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/QwRFG/5/
[04:19:23] <pashmi56> nFFF: cool thanks let me try it
[04:19:43] <XeruX> anyone? :/
[04:19:58] <nFFF> pashmi56, basically just run customHover() again?
[04:20:21] <guy> anyone of a jquery plugin for photo positioning like this?
[04:20:21] <guy> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/45282161/Untitled-2.png
[04:20:42] <pashmi56> nFFF:  yep seems to be working thanks :) was too easy!
[04:20:53] <nFFF> :))
[04:21:19] <pashmi56> nfff: thank you very much
[04:22:08] <nFFF> np
[04:26:47] <imanc> hey - I have a small chunk of JS which disables a form's submit button when the form is submitted, to prevent double posting.  And it works fine in all browsers, but in IE8, for some weird reason, disabling the submit button in a form's submit() handler causes IE to not send the post data back to the server. Any ideas on a work around?
[04:28:25] <snagnever> imanc: in which order are you disabling?
[04:29:15] <imanc> this is what i'm doing http://pastie.org/3308797
[04:29:27] <imanc> I figure I could just create a variable  var submitted = false; and use that instead
[04:39:36] <wmage> Hey there. So I have a jQuery object, and I wanna do something with it when it's inserted in DOM. I don't know when it's going to be inserted into DOM. Is there any event that will notify me?
[04:43:15] <mindis|wurk> hrrrmmm. how do you get the raw HTML content from an iframe? i mean with all document definitions etc. and just the body or <html>
[04:43:23] <mindis|wurk> *not just
[04:45:34] <Germanaz0> Hello I have a problem with some events, in fivestar plugin
[04:46:16] <Germanaz0> I load hidden elements from ajax, then move them to another "visible" div, but the events that launch the fivestar plugin do not work
[04:46:21] <Germanaz0> neither with livequery
[04:46:30] <fof> wmage would livequery work?
[04:46:39] <fof> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery#Overview
[04:46:44] <wmage> probably but I'd rather do it without plugin
[04:47:16] <fof> yeah, just found that in a stackexchange thread asking the same question
[04:48:38] <fof> can you not set up a callback on whatever is inserting stuff?
[04:53:17] <K3|Chris|Work> I can't find it on the site, how do you trim the current query to first x of items? say 5?
[04:53:54] <K3|Chris|Work> kinda like .first() but the first 5
[04:55:37] <shesek> K3|Chris|Work, .slice(0,5)
[04:56:44] <shesek> K3|Chris|Work, or just $.fn.firstn = (n) -> @slice 0, n
[04:57:05] <shesek> Sorry, I mean $.fn.firstn = function(n) { return this.slice(0,n); }
[04:58:01] <K3|Chris|Work> I get the first way, second I don't... thanks though I'll use the first )=P
[04:59:06] <shesek> K3|Chris, you can add an `firstn` method with `$.fn.firstn = function(n) { return this.slice(0,n); }`
[04:59:14] <shesek> than you can just do $('stuff').firstn(5)
[05:04:26] <mindis|wurk> dear god javascript is ridiculous. you can't even get the source of a webpage without ajax calls :D
[05:05:35] <dogan21> hello,  is it possible to toggle a radio input selection or prevent its selection?

[05:07:43] <Staley> i need som advice regarding jsonp in jquery 1.7.1
[05:07:53] <xec> ?ask
[05:07:54] <bot-t1> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:10:22] <Staley> the problem is that in jquery 1.4.1 the jsonp answer is displayed in the application and with jquery 1.7.1 the result is aquired but does not show in the application
[05:11:52] <fof> K3|Chris|Work: http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/basil/archive/2008/09/22/defining-your-own-functions-in-jquery.aspx
[05:12:00] <fof> to explain shesek's answer
[05:14:34] <jac0bz1> Anyone with an Paypal account who wants to make some money? I need a simple script or plugin that allows for drag&drop multiple table rows over to an UL.. I've got alot of code you might work from.. but now I'm stuck and I need help.. name your price!
[05:14:36] <K3|Chris|Work> thanks fof and shesek :)
[05:14:54] <Germanaz0> livequery launch multiples times
[05:14:58] <Germanaz0> the same event
[05:24:00] <lilleman> $("#gallery_form").submit(); works great, but $("#gallery_form").submit(function(){}); does not. What can cause this? I'm stuck... :/
[05:25:22] <nFFF> lilleman, jsfiddle.net
[05:25:59] <mchalk> what do you call those regex type things in jquery selectors?
[05:26:27] <nFFF> mchalk, e.h. ?
[05:26:30] <nFFF> e.g.
[05:27:02] <mchalk> totally forgot what they're called/how to use them, i don't use jquery much
[05:27:06] <mchalk> umm
[05:27:28] <mchalk> $('attribute which ends in .php')
[05:27:47] <mchalk> there was some syntax for that, i forgot what it's called
[05:27:54] <nFFF> The selectors used for DOM
[05:28:07] <nFFF> Not finding a file
[05:28:14] <fof> looks like a decent exercise: http://www.inserthtml.com/2012/02/making-interactive-wall-images-jquery/
[05:28:46] <nFFF> mchalk, unless you have a class called 'php' on an element in the DOM
[05:28:49] <lilleman> nFFF: Doesnt help me very much... I get the same results there, and I dont know why
[05:28:51] <nFFF> it won't work
[05:29:04] <nFFF> lilleman, sure but save it and paste the url
[05:29:07] <nFFF> so we can see your full coee
[05:29:15] <nFFF> so we can help
[05:29:22] <mchalk> wanted to select all anchor elements which link to a specific php file
[05:29:23] <lilleman> aaaah, ofc. :)
[05:29:25] <MystMan> any tutorials someone can send me to for creating a right click menu?
[05:29:41] <nFFF> mchalk, you need a bit of code for that :)
[05:30:03] <mchalk> darn
[05:30:06] <mchalk> not more code :(
[05:30:27] <lilleman> http://jsfiddle.net/K9W9r/
[05:31:12] <lilleman> Its a drag'n drop and I want the form to be executed in the background each time mouse key is released from a li... but I just cant get the darn submit() to work... :S
[05:31:17] <nFFF> $('a').each(function(){ if($(this).attr('href') == <regex here>) { <do this } });
[05:32:14] <mchalk> nFFF, should i use what you just wrote or should i just change the php to give a class to the <a>?
[05:32:29] <Hooloovoork> mchalk: can't you just do $("a[type=<link>]")
[05:32:33] <Hooloovoork> no wiat
[05:32:38] <Hooloovoork> [href=<link>]
[05:32:44] * Hooloovoork is so stupid
[05:32:57] <mchalk> what does <> denote?
[05:32:58] <nFFF> perhaps you can do it Hooloovoork way ^^
[05:33:10] <Hooloovoork> <> denote the link you want to target
[05:33:34] <mchalk> hmm ok
[05:33:35] <mchalk> i shall try it
[05:33:38] <mchalk> ty
[05:33:48] <Hooloovoork> [href=whatever] targets elements with a href attribute that's equal to "whatever" in this case
[05:33:48] <nFFF> lilleman and where is the submit on the page to test
[05:34:35] <mchalk> will <whatever> search the href for 'whatever'?
[05:34:52] <Hooloovoork> mchalk: skip the <>
[05:34:56] <mchalk> oh right
[05:34:57] <mchalk> gotchya
[05:34:58] <Hooloovoork> but yes
[05:35:13] <lilleman> nFFF: There is no submit-button... but the form should submit to the same URL where a PHP backend will handle the data
[05:35:27] <mchalk> because the actual href is sort of long and has _GET values at the end of it
[05:35:41] <jac0bz1> !help before I kill my self :P
[05:36:48] <jac0bz1> I have a droppable: $("#foo li a").droppable(); but when i drop objects in one A, all the other "a" elements returns the deactivate event and this event is executed before the "drop" event...
[05:37:10] <Hooloovoork> mchalk: i think there's a wildcard version of it
[05:37:49] <Hooloovoork> mchalk: [href^=url]
[05:37:54] <Hooloovoork> that means begins with
[05:38:06] <Hooloovoork> so you can have any get vars after that and i'll still match
[05:38:27] <lilleman> nFFF: If the submit() can just return an alert() I'm happy :)
[05:38:38] <nFFF> I can't see why it wouldn't
[05:38:45] <lilleman> nFFF: Me neither :( But it doesnt
[05:39:13] <nFFF> $("a[type=*.php*]")
[05:39:42] <MystMan> any tutorials someone can send me to for creating a right click menu?
[05:39:46] <lilleman> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/K9W9r/1/ that works
[05:40:07] <mchalk> thanks Hooloovoork
[05:40:14] <lilleman> but if I add function(){/*whatever*/}
[05:40:18] <lilleman> then it doesnt
[05:43:27] <Hooloovoork> np
[05:43:48] <nFFF> lilleman I hoenstly have no idea
[05:43:55] <nFFF> From my understanding it should work
[05:44:11] <lilleman> nFFF: okok, thanks a lot for the help. You confirmed I'm not just superstupid \o/
[05:44:35] <lilleman> I'll hunt further, lets see if I can get it to work :)
[05:44:37] <nFFF> a
[05:44:38] <nFFF> ah
[05:44:39] <nFFF> sec
[05:44:43] <nFFF> does it have to return something
[05:44:46] <nFFF> either true or false

[06:08:38] <vsmith> hey guys I am getting an error from jQuery easing that I have not been able to figure out
[06:08:43] <vsmith> http://shafteldms.diamondbuyers.com/
[06:08:49] <vsmith> its on that page
[06:09:24] <vsmith> it says
[06:09:27] <vsmith> jQuery.easing[jQuery.easing.def] is not a function
[06:09:27] <vsmith> return jQuery.easing[jQuery.easing.def](x, t, b, c, d);
[06:10:01] <vsmith> i am using the fancybox wordpress plugin
[06:10:16] <vsmith> can anyone help
[06:12:27] <gnarf> console.log( $.easing.def ) ?
[06:13:18] <vsmith> undefined
[06:13:32] <vsmith> thats what i get back
[06:14:02] <gnarf> what version of jQuery is that?
[06:14:34] <vsmith> 1.6
[06:15:39] <gnarf> that jQuery.easing doesn't seem standard
[06:16:13] <vsmith> I am unsure but in every version of fancybox it is used
[06:16:27] <vsmith> i even tried to installl fb by hand
[06:16:33] <gnarf> actually
[06:16:41] <vsmith> and there has been problems all the way through
[06:16:44] <gnarf> it seems that something else is overriding easing
[06:17:06] <gnarf> jquery.easing has the swing from easing.js?ver=1.3
[06:17:12] <gnarf> but none of the other stuff
[06:17:49] <vsmith> so what could it be?
[06:18:05] <gnarf> something else it overwriting it?
[06:19:02] <vsmith> what indicates that to you?
[06:19:34] <gnarf> the fact that jQuery.easing doesn't have the rest of the properties that section of code where the error is adds to jQuery.easing
[06:20:22] <vsmith> oh,  I dont even know where to start
[06:21:08] <vsmith> could it be because I see two versions of jquery loading 1.4 & 1.6
[06:21:30] <gnarf> definitely
[06:22:21] <beasty> hi
[06:22:41] <beasty> anyone knows how i can decode a string like '%C3%A9%C3%A9%22%26%22lalal+%26%22' in javascript ?
[06:23:01] <gnarf> urldecode?
[06:23:08] <beasty> is there a urldecode function ?
[06:23:09] <gnarf> unescape?
[06:23:19] <gnarf> sry wrong function name
[06:23:30] <gnarf> ?js unescape("%C3");
[06:23:34] <bot-t> gnarf: "Ã"
[06:23:37] <beasty> unescape gives weird stuff
[06:24:10] <gnarf> ?js unescape("%22")
[06:24:13] <bot-t> gnarf: "\""
[06:24:30] <gnarf> both of those are correct
[06:24:58] <beasty> ?js decodeURI('le+hi');
[06:25:00] <bot-t> beasty: "le+hi"
[06:25:20] <beasty> why isn't this + decoding to a space ?
[06:25:38] <gnarf> because it doesnt?
[06:25:51] <gnarf> ?js decodeURI("%22")
[06:25:52] <bot-t> gnarf: "\""
[06:26:13] <gnarf> ?g mdn decodeURI
[06:26:15] <bot-t> gnarf, decodeURI - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURI
[06:27:23] <gnarf> encodeURI uses %20 instead of +
[06:27:29] <gnarf> ?js encodeURI(" ")
[06:28:00] <Taloncor> ?js escape("foo bar")
[06:28:16] <Taloncor> ?js escape("foo bar");
[06:28:18] <Taloncor> mh
[06:28:51] <beasty> ?js decodeURI('%C3%A9%C3%A9%22%26%22lalal+%26%22').replace(/[+]/g," ");
[06:29:07] <beasty> bot is kaput ?
[06:29:13] <gnarf> why /[+]/ ? why not just /\+/
[06:29:17] <Taloncor> oh no, we killed him
[06:29:48] <beasty> ?js decodeURI('%C3%A9%C3%A9%22%26%22lalal+%26%22').replace(/\+/g," ");
[06:31:19] <juria_roberts> how do i access the script tags inside an iframe?
[06:31:26] <juria_roberts> i did this but didnt work
[06:31:29] <juria_roberts> elements=document.getElementById('srctags').childNodes;
[06:31:31] <juria_roberts> element = jQuery(elements[0]);
[06:31:32] <juria_roberts> jQuery(element).contents().find('script');
[06:31:48] <juria_roberts> elements[0] is iframe btw
[06:32:34] <gnarf> juria_roberts: same domain?
[06:32:36] <gnarf> ?sop
[06:32:50] <juria_roberts> gnarf: no damn
[06:33:02] <juria_roberts> gnarf: thanks for making me realize that
[06:33:04] <gnarf> google "mdn same origin policy"
[06:34:54] <juria_roberts> gnarf: is there a way to do it?
[06:35:07] <gnarf> cross domain? hell no
[06:35:09] <gnarf> and be glad
[06:35:39] <juria_roberts> gnarf: ahh shoot ok
[06:35:54] <martin-g> hi. I need some help with jQuery.Deferred
[06:35:59] <martin-g> here is my code: http://pastie.org/3309411
[06:36:06] <gnarf> martin-g: ask your question
[06:36:24] <martin-g> the problem is that line 42 fires after the first .resolve() (line 27)
[06:36:57] <martin-g> the second deferred.resolve() is executed after .done()
[06:37:13] <martin-g> this is the first time I use Deferred so may be I'm using it wrong
[06:37:33] <juria_roberts> gnarf: can i get the child nodes of the iframe and then get the script tag?
[06:38:15] <gnarf> martin-g: well a) you don't need to .promise() on the dfd's in the when
[06:38:25] <gnarf> (line 40)
[06:38:32] <martin-g> ok. let me try
[06:38:56] <martin-g> same result
[06:39:17] <gnarf> yeah
[06:39:20] <gnarf> i know
[06:39:22] <gnarf> just a tip
[06:39:31] <gnarf> what is this "sh" stuff?
[06:39:54] <Wiz_KeeD> hey guys
[06:40:04] <martin-g> this is success handler executed in jQuery.ajax().success()
[06:40:15] <martin-g> so I fire two .ajax() calls
[06:40:32] <martin-g> each of them has to .resolve() their respective deferreds
[06:40:46] <martin-g> and at the end I want to execute the .done() stuff
[06:40:46] <gnarf> correct
[06:40:54] <Wiz_KeeD> can anyone tell me in this example
[06:40:54] <Wiz_KeeD> http://jsfiddle.net/VNKA7/
[06:40:57] <gnarf> why not just use the result of the ajax calls
[06:41:06] <martin-g> I can't ..
[06:41:09] <gnarf> okay
[06:41:13] <gnarf> in that case
[06:41:14] <Wiz_KeeD> if i select clinet Klar and then a vending machine, how can i empty the vending machine select when i do that?
[06:41:27] <Wiz_KeeD> the purpose is to show only the vending machines that are available for that particular customer
[06:41:48] <Wiz_KeeD> and if i change the customer, then the vending machine field should also show only the proper options and deselect the previously selected one
[06:41:50] <gnarf> martin-g: got this running in a fiddle / someplace i can debug?
[06:42:00] <martin-g> gnarf: ok. thanks !
[06:43:13] <gnarf> martin-g: are you sure your problem isn't that you're resolving the deferred before running your test?
[06:43:30] <gnarf> so like the done will fire before the test on the second ones?
[06:43:31] <Wiz_KeeD> anyone please
[06:43:54] <gnarf> if you call .resolve() it immediately calls done
[06:43:59] <martin-g> my idea is to run both .ajax() calls and each of them to notify me when it is done
[06:44:04] <CoolCoder> only image should load when div is visible on screen(div is scrolling div). any plugin?
[06:44:21] <gnarf> martin-g: it doesn't wait for the next execution loop or anything
[06:44:23] <martin-g> gnarf: but jQuery.when(deferredOne, deferredTwo) should wait both of them, no ?
[06:44:29] <gnarf> yes
[06:44:31] <gnarf> it should
[06:44:33] <gnarf> it does
[06:44:47] <martin-g> but it fires .done after the deferredOne.resolve()
[06:45:01] <martin-g> I'm working on the fiddle
[06:45:03] <fraxture> i am looking at some code that uses a replace() function (eg  var pid = $(this).attr('href').replace('#!/','')), but can only find replaceWith() in the jquery documentation.  is this an old function or something?
[06:45:36] <Wiz_KeeD> can i at least get an answer of some sort?
[06:46:17] <gnarf> martin-g: http://jsfiddle.net/VjfYr/
[06:47:13] <gnarf> martin-g: again - let me point out that you are executing your tests/code AFTER you resolve, not before
[06:47:35] <gnarf> try making the resolve after the test
[06:47:38] <Taloncor> Wiz_Keed: I would not use CSS to show/hide the valid choices
[06:49:06] <martin-g> gnarf: I'm not sure I understand you. I want to get notifications that the ajax (async) calls are done and then do the "finalization" stuff in .done()
[06:49:08] <Wiz_KeeD> Taloncor, i do that but the last option remains selected
[06:49:14] <Wiz_KeeD> even if there are no other fields left
[06:49:35] <martin-g> if I get deferred.resolve correctly it should do the notification for me
[06:49:47] <nFFF> fraxture, replace is a native javascript function
[06:49:59] <martin-g> when both ajax calls say "I'm done" then I want to execute QUnit#start() and the final checks
[06:51:26] <fraxture> nFFF: ok...it seemed like it would be. just was confused because i couldn't bring it up in the documentation.  http://api.jquery.com/?ns0=1&s=replace
[06:53:52] <misulicus> hey guys, stuck at this issue for days now.
[06:53:54] <Wiz_KeeD> not as helpfull as i thought
[06:54:23] <misulicus> I got a page, on wich i must include a js file. I need to replace some strings in that js file that is loaded on the page
[06:54:47] <martin-g> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/ZGLt7/6/
[06:56:02] <danzik17> misulicus: so you need to load the script, but find/replace some strings in said script first?  can you do this server-side?
[06:56:23] <gnarf> martin-g: you are .resolving the deferred BEFORE you call your tests
[06:56:39] <gnarf> so it looks like the "done" will be called before the "second finished test"
[06:56:50] <misulicus> no i dont have access to the js file :(
[06:57:00] <martin-g> gnarf: are you talking now about the fiddle ?
[06:57:10] <misulicus> its on my domain, different location but its like dinamically generated and dont have access to it
[06:57:30] <martin-g> I'm puzzeled
[06:57:30] <gnarf> martin-g: and your test
[06:57:49] <gnarf> put the console.log()s before the resolves
[06:57:58] <martin-g> ok
[06:58:00] <danzik17> misulicus: well, doing it server side would be the best option.  failing that, do a text ajax GET request for the file, do your replacement, then use ?globalEval to eval it
[06:58:00] <bot-t> misulicus, jQuery.globalEval(code): Execute some JavaScript code globally. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.globalEval/
[06:58:10] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/ZGLt7/8/
[06:58:36] <martin-g> ok
[06:58:39] <gnarf> as soon as you call .resolve() on the "second" one - the done function is called
[06:58:39] <martin-g> duh
[06:58:43] <gnarf> :)
[06:58:46] <martin-g> :-)
[06:58:47] <sphinxxx> anyone heard of a bug where supersized (the full size background plugin)  causes a radio button bug (cannot switch radios once one is selected)
[06:58:52] <martin-g> thanks !
[06:58:57] <gnarf> np
[06:58:58] <martin-g> obvious, now
[06:59:01] <gnarf> took me a minute to catch it
[06:59:08] <gnarf> but thats what i meant....
[06:59:16] <martin-g> I see
[06:59:19] <gnarf> martin-g: are you sure your problem isn't that you're resolving the deferred before running your test?
[06:59:31] <danzik17> misulicus: hell, if you don't have access to the script, write your own proxy for it that will request it server side, modify it, and pass back the resulting file to the client, that way you can load it via normal script tags.
[06:59:59] <misulicus> yeah dunno how to do that
[07:00:14] <danzik17> time for some learnin' then
[07:03:30] <ignotus> hi, I have a list of divs in variable like foo=$('div'), and I have a specific div in another, like bar=$('#my-div').  How can I get the place of #my-div in the list of divs in foo?
[07:04:00] <rookie84> what is a DOM (Just the html tags) ?
[07:04:08] <misulicus> ok i think i did it
[07:05:14] <sphinxxx> strangest bug i've ever seen
[07:07:30] <gnarf> ignotus: http://api.jquery.com/index
[07:07:39] <gnarf> ?index @ignotus
[07:07:40] <bot-t> ignotus, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[07:07:53] <ignotus> gnarf: superb, thanks!
[07:08:15] <rookie84> what is a DOM (Just the html tags) ?
[07:09:10] <fof> rookie84: http://www.codecademy.com/courses/jquery-and-the-dom/0#!/exercises/0
[07:09:49] <rookie84> fof: already have read about it, but not being able to understand it i think
[07:09:57] <devmikey> Question: What would you recommend I use to implement a slideshow in jquery?  Straight jquery or a plugin?
[07:09:59] <rookie84> DOM = whatever is inside the html document (HTML DOM i mean)
[07:10:26] <Taloncor> Wiz_KeeD: still here?
[07:11:32] <warrenparsons> devmikey: Depends on the complexity of the slideshow and your comfort level with rolling your own.
[07:11:47] <fof> i think that page explains it very simply
[07:11:58] <rookie84> fof: checking
[07:12:00] <rookie84> thanks
[07:12:10] <devmikey> I'm not very good at jquery
[07:12:45] <warrenparsons> devmikey: Then it's either a plugin or an opportunity to get better with jQuery.
[07:13:36] <Taloncor> Wiz_KeeD: http://jsfiddle.net/VNKA7/2/ <- That works just fine
[07:14:01] <sphinxxx> anyone seen that bug befo? (radio buttons visually won't change after first selection, but change event is firing)
[07:18:50] <Iszak> What's the general consensus of creating a style element within the head element and added custom CSS?
[07:18:54] <Iszak> Is it okay?
[07:19:21] <pngl2> How does jQuery UI droppable detect the element currently under the cursor? How does the dragged element not stop the mouseenter event?
[07:19:52] <Wiz_KeeD> Taloncor, you're right it works there...how come when i copy paste the js on local it doens't work lol
[07:20:13] <Wiz_KeeD> is it because you removed the mobile jquery thing?
[07:20:31] <Taloncor> Wiz_Keed: That maybe the case. Maybe some trouble with too many different scripts? ;)
[07:22:48] <Wiz_KeeD> it's defenantly that
[07:22:54] <Wiz_KeeD> when i remove the jquery mobile, it works
[07:22:54] <Wiz_KeeD> :(
[07:22:57] <Iszak> where's all the cool kids.
[07:23:01] <Iszak> temp01:
[07:23:52] <terryleigh> I've got a select list with a filter at the top, and function that transfers the option to another when doubled clicked.. However if I use the filter, and double click on an option.. when I delete the filter.. the option is still in the first box? http://jsfiddle.net/gAjNH/
[07:24:08] <Jaac> I would like to partially show a new image in a header when i hover over a certain button, does anyone know a plugin that could achieve this?
[07:24:14] <crankharder> i'm working w/ a plugin that doesn't have a callback where I need it.  it adds a tr to a tbody at some point.  how can I watch the tbody for additional children and fire a function when that happens?
[07:27:33] <Taloncor> Wiz_Keed: I'm not sure if jquery mobile and jquery are supposed to be loaded at the same time
[07:27:48] <Wiz_KeeD> it's copied from an online example...
[07:28:09] <Wiz_KeeD> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0.1/docs/about/getting-started.html
[07:28:26] <Wiz_KeeD> it seemed strange to me as well
[07:30:15] <Taloncor> Wiz_KeeD: Never did anything with jquery-mobile .. so i cannot help you with that
[07:30:28] <Wiz_KeeD> i understand, thanks for pointing the problem out though
[07:30:31] <Wiz_KeeD> mucbh apreach
[07:30:38] <Wiz_KeeD> much apreach
[07:31:14] <tfaro> please am having problem with a js...integrating with googlle maps
[07:31:25] <tfaro> My map dont render until i hit browser refresh
[07:46:52] <starsinmypockets> Is it acceptable to use dom elements for access control of jquery functions? For ex: $(.my-div .auth-yeah).doStuff();
[07:47:43] <nFFF> I cant see why not
[07:47:53] <nFFF> starsinmypockets, why wouldn't it ?
[07:50:33] <starsinmypockets> nFFF I gues along the lines of XSS
[07:50:42] <starsinmypockets> but I guess that's more about sanitizing user input...
[07:51:09] <starsinmypockets> I guess there just needs to be good validation server side
[07:51:43] <scar2> is there a non js/jquery way to make 1+ of a set of checkboxes required?
[07:52:31] <starsinmypockets> scar2 well, whatever form processing server side could probably handle that...
[07:52:53] <starsinmypockets> I guess it depends what sort of framework you're using
[07:53:04] <scar2> starsinmypockets: yeah, i just didnt wanna do server side. oh well. i was interested bc of the 'required' attribute allowed for inputs.
[07:55:08] <crankharder> i'm working w/ a plugin that doesn't have a callback where I need it.  it adds a tr to a tbody at some point.  how can I watch the tbody for additional children and fire a function when that happens?
[08:02:32] <jeffsmykil> Is there a better way to get Enter to submit a search then doing if foo has focus and enter is pressed?
[08:04:21] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: What do you mean?
[08:06:20] <jeffsmykil> how do i make enter send a form
[08:06:27] <jeffsmykil> and how do i default to a certain form
[08:06:38] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Browsers do that by default if Enter is pressed while a form input field has focus.
[08:07:18] <jeffsmykil> warrenparsons: this one isn't
[08:07:32] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Then something is wrong with your HTML. Have you validated it?
[08:07:41] <jeffsmykil> yeah not recently
[08:08:17] <Taloncor> What would be the proper way to abort all outstanding ajax requests? I don't care what the backend does, i just want to the frontend to ignore all answer
[08:08:36] <e-anima> if you set an element hidden with jquery and then get height()...can it be taht it somehow uses the hidden element too, for the calculation?
[08:09:21] <warrenparsons> e-anima: Not if the hidden element is set to display: none; which jQuery's .hide() method does.
[08:10:04] <warrenparsons> e-anima: You would have to store the element's height before hiding it, or use an alternate means of hiding it.
[08:10:15] <e-anima> i am playing around with jsTree. somehow here height() gets huuge numbers bause it calculates if the whole tree with all elements is visible
[08:10:53] <warrenparsons> e-anima: It sounds like it's grabbing the height value too soon, before the collapse routine executes.
[08:10:54] <e-anima> somehow, the calculated values that firebug shows me are the normal values
[08:11:11] <e-anima> warrenparsons yes. some idea how i could fix this
[08:12:00] <warrenparsons> e-anima: I haven't worked with jsTree, but conceptually: you need to edit the code to make the height calculation run as a callback to the collapse routine.
[08:13:36] <e-anima> ok out of my skill range forking that script. but thank you warrenparsons
[08:14:03] <warrenparsons> e-anima: Are you grabbing the height in your own code, or is it part of jsTree?
[08:14:26] <e-anima> i am grabbing the height by myself. some simple equalHeight script
[08:14:41] <e-anima> iam setting sidebar+main area to same height
[08:15:03] <e-anima> that atm is 7890 px :)
[08:15:10] <warrenparsons> e-anima: I would check to see if the jsTree developer included a param to supply your own callback function. That's where I would put my code that includes grabbing the height reference. That way you know it's happening after jsTree has finished its execution.
[08:15:47] <e-anima> checking docs
[08:15:53] <warrenparsons> e-anima: Failing that there's always setTimout(), but that's a little unreliable in situations like this.
[08:22:21] <kanzie> I realized a problem with using .is(':visible') on iOS giving me a false true for an element that on the desktop gives me false. Is there a more reliable test I can use_
[08:22:22] <kanzie> ?
[08:22:59] <warrenparsons> kanzie: Are you checking whether the element is "hidden" or whether it's been scrolled into view?
[08:23:10] <kanzie> if it is hidden
[08:23:18] <e-anima> warrenparsons hm i found nothing. so you suggest using setTimout() and the use height()
[08:23:25] <e-anima> as a "fix hacky"
[08:23:25] <warrenparsons> kanzie: And how are you hiding it?
[08:23:35] <warrenparsons> e-anima: As a last resort.
[08:23:42] <e-anima> ok thx
[08:24:01] <kanzie> warrenparsons: checking
[08:25:23] <tutukatu> hi i am sending a input data like "!'^+%&/()=?" but something happening and not going truly
[08:25:39] <kanzie> warrenparsons: seems like Im using a fadeOut
[08:25:58] <kanzie> should I add a .hide() when fadeout is complete just to be sure?
[08:26:04] <warrenparsons> kanzie: There's a couple ways you could do it.
[08:26:18] <warrenparsons> kanzie: .hide() just sets display: none;, which .fadeOut() does when it finishes anyway.
[08:26:52] <warrenparsons> kanzie: You could add a class to the element in .fadeOut()'s callback, then  check for that class with .hasClass() instead of checking .is(':visible')
[08:26:58] <kanzie> warrenparsons: strange that it gives me true on is(:visible on iOS then...
[08:26:59] <kanzie> hmmm
[08:27:08] <kanzie> warrenparsons: ok
[08:27:17] <warrenparsons> kanzie: Strange that :visible isn't working, tho.
[08:27:25] <lduros> dammit I have a memory problem: how do you called the function that you execute immediately, like: (function () { ... })();
[08:27:31] <kanzie> warrenparsons: yeah, working fine on desktop, same code
[08:27:47] <warrenparsons> lduros: function(){ … }()
[08:28:07] <tutukatu> encodeURI(  $("#-text").val()  ) works good i think but not tottaly doing its job : from !!!!!!'^+%&/()= after:: !!!!!!'%5E+%25&/()=
[08:28:15] <lduros> warrenparsons: but what is the name of it?
[08:28:17] <warrenparsons> lduros: The executing parens need to go inside the enclosing parens.
[08:28:46] <lduros> oups ok, but in any case, how do you call such construct in javascript
[08:29:08] <warrenparsons> lduros: Immediately Invoked Function Expression or "IIFE"
[08:29:16] <lduros> aaaah
[08:29:25] <lduros> warrenparsons: ok thanks! :-) and thanks for the correction too
[08:29:38] <warrenparsons> lduros: I guess the way you wrote it works too.
[08:29:52] <warrenparsons> lduros: Just looked weird.
[08:30:02] <K3|Chris|Work> how would I wrap every 15 items of a particular selector (say div.Item) in a div with a specific class? so 16 items 15 in a div, 16:th either no div around it at all, or in it's own
[08:30:23] <K3|Chris|Work> working with a tricky layout with dynamic content etc
[08:30:24] <lduros> warrenparsons: isn't it the way crockford makes it look so that it looks weird and you know it's an IIFE?
[08:31:21] <warrenparsons> lduros: Crockford recommends execution parens inside enclosing parens, at least according to Ben Alman's article on it - http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[08:31:51] <lduros> okk, i was doing this: (function(){ /* code */ })(); // But this one works just as well
[08:31:53] <warrenparsons> lduros: Maybe he changed his mind…
[08:32:07] <lduros> I  don't nkow, I'll have to check in JS the good parts
[08:32:29] <lduros> anyway, I'm not necessarily doing what crockford wants
[08:32:30] <lduros> :-)
[08:33:07] <warrenparsons> K3|Chris|Work: You could check your loop/each index against modulus 15.
[08:33:39] <K3|Chris|Work> if I knew enough PHP yeah...
[08:33:46] <lduros> warrenparsons: in any case, any sort of wrapping parens is compltely optional right? you could have none and it would be ok
[08:33:56] <warrenparsons> K3|Chris|Work: The mod operator is % in most languages.
[08:34:02] <lduros> as long as you have the two parens at the end to execute the function just defined
[08:34:04] <warrenparsons> K3|Chris|Work: Otherwise keyword "mod"
[08:34:05] <K3|Chris|Work> I'm working with PHP tags written by the PHP guy, I'm the CSS/JS guy
[08:35:01] <warrenparsons> K3|Chris|Work: if ( i % 15 == 0 ) { do stuff } - Feels wrong writing double equals...
[08:36:11] <vsmith> wow I just wasted two hours trying to resolve a jquery error
[08:36:28] <vsmith> still no success
[08:36:42] <warrenparsons> vsmith: Did you validate your HTML?
[08:37:11] <vsmith> Im using wordpress
[08:37:29] <warrenparsons> vsmith: Wordpress outputs HTML. You should make sure it's valid.
[08:37:39] <vsmith> and there are some og facebook tags that wont validate
[08:37:45] <vsmith> it's connected to a plugin
[08:37:54] <vsmith> Open Graph
[08:37:59] <vsmith> = og
[08:38:03] <warrenparsons> vsmith: And you can work around the validation errors that you know aren't related to your issue.
[08:38:24] <warrenparsons> vsmith: The point is you make sure your HTML isn't the cause of your JS errors.
[08:38:57] <vsmith> I have definitely been working around them.  the issue us some type of undefined function
[08:39:13] <vsmith> the issue is*
[08:39:27] <vsmith> http://shafteldms.diamondbuyers.com/
[08:39:32] <vsmith> that's the site
[08:46:53] <kanzie> can I somehow have a click-handler preventing the action of any other click-handlers registered for an element?
[08:47:18] <kanzie> I want to have ability to temporarily lock the screen and don't want to find and unbind/bind all handlers in the UI
[08:47:26] <Flockkee> does anyone know why this code: http://pastebin.com/cZHVe6xT only outputs the text for a second and then the text vanishes again?
[08:51:39] <nFFF> Flockkee, upload relevant code to jsfiddle.net
[08:58:50] <grein> i'm trying to implement history.js throughout my site. a function which was previously functioning well, is now not really working because it's storing its state between pagerenderings. how would i force this function to render freshly once per pagerender?
[09:00:14] <grein> the function, by the way, is jquery.pageless ;(
[09:10:12] <pace_t_zulu> this channel has more join/leave s than messages
[09:12:38] <xec> please don't interrupt - i was reading the joins and parts, trying to keep track of everyone
[09:13:53] <xec> pace_t_zulu: seriously though, you should use a client that allows you to either ignore those types of messages or color them close to the background color,
[09:14:34] <pace_t_zulu> xec: i like having joins and parts in most channels i'm in
[09:15:05] <Chee> i have them ignoered *only* in this channel
[09:15:19] <Chee> i should really ignore them in #html5 too
[09:15:32] <Chee> there's a message there every couple of years
[09:15:47] <meowmi> is the drag & drop in HTML5 worth using
[09:15:52] <meowmi> or should we just stick to jquery's d&d
[09:16:26] <xec> meowmi: is cross-browser support important to you?
[09:16:42] <meowmi> of course
[09:16:54] <chee> meowmi: I would use Modernizr and use html5's drag and drop if it was available, and jQuery's if not
[09:17:05] <meowmi> cross browser and support for browsers as old as IE 6!
[09:17:23] <xec> isn't IE dead yet? *goes back to sleep*
[09:17:27] <meowmi> oh twice the work then
[09:17:56] <xec> meowmi: you obviously don't have support for new features in old browsers
[09:17:57] <meowmi> :( not for my bloody clients and their client's clients!
[09:18:20] <meowmi> all stuck in ie 6 because their IT does not want them to upgrade
[09:18:43] <chee> meowmi: yes. twice the work is usually the result of wanting to support a lot of browsers and give them the best experience
[09:19:12] <meowmi> checking out modernizr
[09:19:41] <chee> actually i wonder if I really would do that...
[09:19:58] <xec> chee: indeed, sounds like a lot of work ^^
[09:20:10] <chee> i mean i would with everything else, but the html5 drag-and-drop api is pretty devestating
[09:20:39] <chee> though i think it works in ie6, doesn't it? lol?
[09:20:49] <xec> wha
[09:21:09] <meowmi> does it now?
[09:21:22] <chee> xec: well isn't the html5 drag-n-drop spec based on the Internet Explorer implementation?
[09:21:27] <chee> and wasn't that from ie6?
[09:22:00] <chee> it might even have been from ie5
[09:23:50] <Blutterbob> I want to intercept a textarea key event. If user presses enter, the form must submit in background, and the text must clear. If they press CTRL enter though, I have to treat it like a normal enter (so basically, make it ignore the enter key).. I can capture the enter and CTRL-enter w/o problem, but I can not get the CTRL-enter to work like a normal enter.. How would I do this?
[09:24:25] <xec> chee: i can't find any good docs over support... but i did find this, dated 13th feb 2000! http://www.irt.org/articles/js204/
[09:24:34] <chee> xec: yes lol!
[09:24:40] <chee> and the example works in Chrome!
[09:24:42] <chee> http://www.irt.org/articles/js204/iefull.htm
[09:24:57] <chee> hahaha. oh, internet.
[09:25:20] <chee> 'Works in IE 5.0 only'
[09:25:22] <chee> disagree.
[09:25:28] <xec> hehe brilliant
[09:25:49] <xec> no dice in safari though
[09:25:58] <chee> weird!
[09:25:58] <xec> err firefox
[09:26:01] <chee> ohh
[09:26:18] <xec> DOES work in safari
[09:26:44] <xec> but it says "undefined has been added.." hehe
[09:26:46] <chee> it's great that a web page that hasn't worked for 10 years would suddenly come back to life
[09:27:13] <xec> hehe yeah, this is fun
[09:28:15] <chee> i wonder if *this*
[09:28:16] <chee> http://nettutsplus.s3.amazonaws.com/64_html5dragdrop/demo/index.html
[09:28:19] <chee> would work on ie5
[09:28:42] <xec> thankfully, i do not have ie5 anywhere
[09:28:49] <chee> hahaha
[09:29:19] <meowmi> very nice
[09:29:37] <grein> i'm trying to implement history.js throughout my site. the plugin jquery.pageless which was previously functioning well, is now not really working because it's storing its state between pagerenderings. how would i force this plugin to render freshly once per pagerender?
[09:29:42] <xec> doesnt work in opera though
[09:31:00] <jeffsmykil> How do I put if the curosr is in this element in an if statement?
[09:33:08] <jeffsmykil> im not sure how else to say that
[09:33:29] <jeffsmykil> i want a tooltip to disapear if the mouse leaves unless its in another specified element
[09:33:53] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: i think you mean you want to check for focus see ?:focus
[09:34:05] <kborchers> lazy bot
[09:34:16] <jeffsmykil> does focus work on none inputs?
[09:34:48] <xec> jeffsmykil: you could make the other specified element a descendant?
[09:34:55] <kborchers> no, by cursor, i assumed you meant an input ... you meant pointer?
[09:34:58] <kborchers> hmm
[09:35:10] <jeffsmykil> Yes, sorry for the confusion
[09:35:23] <jeffsmykil> xec the other element is the tooltip itself
[09:35:32] <z0ned> anyone able to answer this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9088609/google-maps-api-v3-fit-map-to-markers-while-keeping-center-point-fixed
[09:36:21] <xec> jeffsmykil: any reason you can't make the tooltip element a descendant
[09:37:10] <jeffsmykil> yeah there is... it is absolutely positioned to another element
[09:37:38] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: if the tooltip isn't a descendant, in your mouseleave, use setTimeout to delay closing, then clearTimeout on mouseenter of your tooltip, then close tooltip of mouseleave of the tooltip as well. make sense?
[09:38:05] <jeffsmykil> yes that makes sense
[09:38:05] <kborchers> on mouseleave*
[09:38:07] <jeffsmykil> thank you
[09:38:14] <kborchers> :)
[09:38:55] <jeffsmykil> not quite "duh, why didn't I think of that" sense, but glad to have an answer none the less
[09:40:40] <Vorspire> using $.ajax with ajaxOptions.crossDomain = true causes IE to block calling code or silently fail the request, if the supplied dynamic url is in fact a local resourse
[09:40:59] <Vorspire> is that supposed to happen?
[09:42:55] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: thank you
[09:43:03] <kborchers> np
[09:43:39] <jeffsmykil> ive always been afraid of settimeout but i guess its not that evil
[09:44:56] <Onkeltem> Hi. Is it possible to pass additional data to an even handler? For example: $(....).click( myClickHandler, { some: data }) ?
[09:46:01] <jeffsmykil> this doesn
[09:46:08] <jeffsmykil> This doesn't seem to work: <form action="javascript: Search1.search()">
[09:46:46] <jeffsmykil> should i be using on submit?
[09:47:12] <scar2> jeffsmykil: you dont need to use javascript:
[09:47:21] <scar2> also, you can put on the submit ubtton onClick or whatever
[09:47:42] <jeffsmykil> scar2: the issue was that it wasnt submitting on pressing enter
[09:47:50] <jeffsmykil> which was because it wasn't in a form field
[09:47:57] <jeffsmykil> on click it calls that function
[09:48:05] <talntid> Using uploadify, how would I pass on the names of the files that were uploaded, to something else? I have not found it in the documentation...
[09:48:35] <jeffsmykil> scar2: did that make any sense?
[09:49:44] <jeffsmykil> scar2: searches are handled in the url string
[09:50:35] <georgestephanis> Anyone around that can help me debug something in UI.Slider?  I figure it's probably user error, but for the live of me I can't figure out what I did wrong.
[09:51:04] <georgestephanis> Try dragging the sliders on http://rgbapng.com/ around and watch your JS console
[09:52:37] <devmikey> what's the line for including jquery from a different server?
[09:53:04] <georgestephanis> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script> ?
[09:57:06] <devmikey> ty
[09:57:41] <Germanaz0> hello
[09:57:56] <Germanaz0> Why $(element).html() do not return the javascript sources
[09:57:59] <Germanaz0> inside the element ?
[10:06:40] <AfroTurf> if i have a span next to an input can i select it by $("input").next("span")?
[10:10:15] <Mkop> AfroTurf: yes
[10:10:25] <AfroTurf> Mkop: thx!
[10:12:44] <grein> i'm trying to implement history.js throughout my site. the plugin jquery.pageless which was previously functioning well, is now not really working because it's storing its state between pagerenderings. how would i force this plugin to render freshly once per pagerender?
[10:15:32] <Mkop> georgestephanis: I think it expects parameters to be integers not strings
[10:15:53] <Mkop> where it dies, alignValue ="0.490.01"
[10:16:08] <Mkop> because it did string addition instead of numeric
[10:16:26] <georgestephanis> Gotcha.  So I just need to convert them to floats when I'm initializing?
[10:16:52] <Mkop> yeah, I guess so
[10:17:44] <bnb_dev> Hello
[10:17:54] <krz> what technology is https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload using? flash?
[10:18:25] <bnb_dev> can i stop and resume execution of jquery code written in another file ?
[10:18:56] <tomoyuki28jp> How do you convert "\n" to <br />? Do you manually call .replace() ?
[10:19:12] <Mkop> tomoyuki28jp: that's certainly one (good) way
[10:19:22] <georgestephanis> Mkop: Take another look -- I'm trying to do toFixed, but it's kicking the error that `Uncaught TypeError: Object 127 has no method 'toFixed'`
[10:19:28] <bnb_dev> is there any one who let me know?
[10:19:32] <tomoyuki28jp> Mkop: thanks
[10:20:29] <georgestephanis> Mkop: Think I found it.  I need to parseFloat before I can toFixed
[10:21:05] <Mkop> you probably don't even care about toFixed
[10:22:27] <georgestephanis> Mkop: My code is good now, now it's the jQuery-UI Slider code that's kicking the error on return parseFloat( alignValue.toFixed(5) ); --- alignValue is an object and can't be toFixed-ed.
[10:22:33] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: Is this the right syntax?  var t = setTimeout('unHighlightBars.call(this); hideToolTip();', 3000);
[10:22:37] <jeffsmykil> for multiple functions
[10:22:50] <tomoyuki28jp> Anybody using jsrender?
[10:22:58] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: no
[10:23:26] <kborchers> var t = setTimeout(function(){unHighlightBars.call(this); hideToolTip();}, 3000);
[10:23:30] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: ^^
[10:23:42] <jeffsmykil> oh
[10:23:58] <georgestephanis> jeffsmykil: If you pass it a string, it will eval() the string and not know what context `this` refers to
[10:24:57] <jeffsmykil> how can i remedy thaty georgestephanis
[10:25:09] <georgestephanis> jeffsmykil: By doing what kborchers said.
[10:25:23] <Mkop> georgestephanis: drop the tofixed()
[10:25:48] <Mkop> you need to pass it a float. toFixed() is undoing all the fine work you previously did, and converts back to a string
[10:26:21] <georgestephanis> Mkop: Ingenius!  It works!
[10:26:22] <jeffsmykil> this.id is undefined
[10:26:38] <jeffsmykil> hrm
[10:26:56] <georgestephanis> Mkop: You'd think the slider code would convert it to floats to avoid this problem.  shrug.
[10:28:17] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: it's having trouble because this is going into this: $("#a" + this.id.substring(1)
[10:28:20] <jeffsmykil> in the next fucntion
[10:31:38] <kborchers> jeffsmykil:you prob need to do something like var that = this; before your setTimeout and then use that instead of this in setTimeout ... i think ;)
[10:32:04] <jeffsmykil> k
[10:37:09] <dddbmt> I've written a few small jquery plugins. And up untill now the main part of my code is in the "methods" object. An basically nothing in the actual function for my plugin. Is that the correct aproach?
[10:37:46] <MrBig> hello, i am using an anchor that gets its action canceled by $('a').live('click', it then loads the page by using $('content').html("loading").load, however, once i click it, i have to move my mouse away from the anchor to get the element to load, any ideas?
[10:39:11] <MrBig> if i remove the html("loading..."). it loads fine with mouse where ever
[10:41:18] <pigiman> Hey there, how do I catch 404 errors with jsonp and $.ajax?
[10:44:20] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: the new problem is http://pastebin.com/p8XCp5yk
[10:44:26] <jeffsmykil> the first function knows what this is
[10:44:34] <jeffsmykil> but at the second one it no longer exists
[10:46:29] <jeffsmykil> anyone really, my coworker didn't know the terminology in javascript but he kind of muttered something about capturing
[10:50:52] <dilvie> jeffsmykil: that is storing a key from this in the closure for the .mouseleave function expression.
[10:51:07] <jeffsmykil> yes
[10:51:55] <smykes> dilvie: so is what Im attempting to do impossible?
[10:52:22] <v0lksman> long shot but does anyone in here use tablesorter and know how to exclude a row (IE a summary row at the bottom of the table that should not be included in the sort)
[10:52:30] <mattp_> http://pastie.org/3310832 am i allowed to do stuff like this in javascript/jquery?
[10:53:05] <dilvie> smykes: JavaScript has function scope. Only functions defined in the .mouseleave handler have access to that
[10:53:41] <smykes> dilvie: global variable work?
[10:54:18] <smykes> i cant freeze this.id to that moment in time?
[10:54:42] <v0lksman> var foo = this.id;
[10:54:43] <v0lksman> ?
[10:54:56] <smykes> i tried that
[10:55:03] <dilvie> smykes: sure you can freeze it. just wrap your call to unhighlight bars in a function
[10:55:43] <dilvie> smykes: can you post your example on jsfiddle.net?
[10:56:37] <smykes> dilvie: that would probably take me several hours :/
[10:57:12] <dilvie> why on earth would it take you several hours? Can't you just copy and paste this code?
[10:57:30] <smykes> its part of a bigger app
[10:57:37] <dilvie> I realize that.
[10:57:39] <smykes> i gave you what is easy to give you
[10:57:44] <smykes> let me try one thing then I ll try
[10:57:54] <dilvie> If you can't reproduce with a simplified test case, I can't help you.
[10:58:17] <MrBig> is this a jquery bug? has it been fixed? what version? http://pastie.org/3310862
[10:59:44] <smykes> dilvie: i understand
[11:01:30] <smykes> I got it to work dilvie
[11:01:41] <smykes> the C# developers comment was: "What a stupid language"
[11:05:03] <smykes> is the set timeout variable somehow global?
[11:05:12] <smykes> or do i have to call cleartimeout from the same function?
[11:06:21] <MagePsycho> guys can you recommend the good jQuery plugin for uploading multiple images
[11:06:41] <dilvie> The C# developer has no idea what he's talking about. Closures are a little weird to wrap your head around at first, but first class functions and closures make JavaScript very powerful and felxible.
[11:07:09] <smykes> dilvie: he said it because the I added a function name and it worked
[11:07:47] <dilvie> smykes: for cleartimeout, you just have to pass the same function back to it.
[11:08:24] <smykes> im not sure i follow
[11:08:34] <dilvie> smykes: again, he doesn't know what he's talking about. Flexible function expressions are a great feature of JavaScript.
[11:08:44] <jonko> yo im new to this even my name say it so we can read your query and figure out the intent easier
[11:09:13] <dilvie> if you do setTimeout(foo); you can do clearTimeout(foo); anywhere you have access to foo.
[11:09:22] <aqeel> hi room
[11:09:25] <StrangeLoop> Hi, I'm trying to have something occur when an element defined inside a fancybox instance is blurred... I dunno how to explain myself clearly, so here's a code snippet: http://codepad.org/WGc9zRab
[11:09:45] <dilvie> in other words, it's not global.. just make sure you have access to the function you pass in where you want to clear the timeout.
[11:09:48] <StrangeLoop> I'd expect the alert to pop up as soon as I click outside the text field in the form, but it does not. What am I missing?
[11:09:52] <aqeel> using which functions is faster and better for internal html addition
[11:10:10] <aqeel> like .text()
[11:10:25] <aqeel> but i also want html insertiona nd not as text
[11:10:49] <dilvie> smykes: oh, I lied. setTimeout returns an id that you can pass into clearTimeout, so anywhere that ID is in scope, you can call clearTimeout.
[11:10:50] <MagePsycho>  guys can you recommend the good jQuery plugin for uploading multiple images
[11:11:00] <dilvie> var myTimer = setTimeout(foo);
[11:11:02] <v0lksman> aqeel: .html()?
[11:11:06] <dilvie> clearTimeout(myTimer);
[11:11:21] <smykes> yeah
[11:11:21] <sphinxxx> dilvie: i think the syntax is myTimer = clearTimeout(myTimer)
[11:11:27] <aqeel> ok let me see.....thanks
[11:11:27] <v0lksman> MagePsycho: jquery-file-upload
[11:11:31] <smykes> but it has to be within the same function
[11:11:45] <sphinxxx> both probably work, just the way i've always done it :o
[11:11:51] <MagePsycho> what about uploadify?
[11:12:04] <v0lksman> either...jquery-file-upload is way nicer though
[11:12:08] <v0lksman> IMO
[11:12:19] <dilvie> sphinxxx: No, it's not. You get the id of the timer as the return value from setTimeout
[11:12:30] <sona_> MagePsycho: plupload
[11:13:07] <dilvie> smykes: it doesn't have to be within the same function, you can pass the value of your timer id var to whatever function you want.

[11:14:09] <jonko> right etc ? http : //pastebin
[11:15:58] <student1> when i do new Array("a","b") i get ["a", "b"] but
[11:16:04] <jonko> or student1 b, git clone a repo
[11:16:22] <student1> when i do array.push i get [["a"]]
[11:16:49] <student1> its nested, how do i add items to array in the same way i declared them?
[11:16:56] <jonko> can't get better when you started rebasing, was it just to relate
[11:17:26] <MagePsycho> plupload has some restriction
[11:17:44] <MagePsycho> i think jquery-file-upload looks good: v01ksman
[11:17:48] <aqeel> perfect...
[11:18:04] <MagePsycho> v01ksman: does it support multiple upload
[11:18:26] <aqeel> i really don't believe how misguided people are in here.....as i was asking how to load the content and no one mentioned the simplest solution
[11:18:40] <v0lksman> MagePsycho: yep...give the demo a try...if you are looking for image upload it's likely exactly what you want...
[11:19:03] <aqeel> <v0lksman>  u r a saviour
[11:19:03] <MagePsycho> Yeah i want it for image upload.. infact image gallery
[11:19:32] <v0lksman> MagePsycho: it is perfectly suited for that purpose...almost to a fault...I had to rip stuff out of it for a non-image gallery function
[11:19:34] <aqeel> now i no need to use load funtioon....
[11:20:32] <badoskie> is there any tool that can convert jquery code into pure javascript?
[11:20:35] <aqeel> i can simply use .text, .html, .hover and the content will be affected as one does the hover  hover
[11:21:00] <talntid> badoskie, notepad can
[11:22:04] <aqeel> jquery is pure javascript.....what u intend to do....
[11:22:40] <aqeel> it just helps u use shorthand that is all
[11:22:42] <thang> lol aqeel
[11:22:52] <badoskie> lol @ talntid
[11:23:31] <aqeel> well explain if it is not?
[11:23:48] <thang> no aqeel i was laughing imagining your reaction to that statement
[11:23:56] <badoskie> I know a bit of javascript. Now, there's something I want to achieve. I can do it in jQuery, but I cannot do it in Javascript, and I want to put it on sites where I won't be able to load jQuery
[11:24:17] <aqeel> i c
[11:24:27] <aqeel> yup....silly stuff from people
[11:25:42] <aqeel> badoskie you can simply reversi engineer some stuff....if u can do it in jquery just follow it in reverse order...
[11:26:34] <aqeel> $("#id") = document.getelementbyid("#id)....stuff like that
[11:27:10] <nbari> hi all, how can i make jquery-ui combobox to autocomplete using the value instead of the text ?
[11:27:16] <nbari> here is an example or test http://jsfiddle.net/Em4bH/1/
[11:27:42] <nbari> I would like that the select box displays the 'text' but to fill the inputbox with the 'value'
[11:28:37] <e-anima> someone here uses dynatree?
[11:29:33] <snagnever> hey, how to check that a element has been removed?
[11:30:10] <snagnever> $elm1 = $('#sameid'); $elm2= ('#sameid'); $elm1.remove(); $elm2. ?!
[11:30:19] <sennahoj> can anyone tell me, why the release cycle of ui slowed down that much?
[11:31:22] <nbari> anyone ?
[11:32:09] <nbari> http://jsfiddle.net/Em4bH/2/ <--- how to fill the inputbox with the 'value' of the select element instead of the text ?
[11:32:30] <jamov> sennahoj, they got most of the bugs fixed and loads of features implemented?
[11:32:47] <snagnever> im using .parent().length > 0
[11:33:09] <warrenparsons> snagnever: if ( !$('#sameid').length ) will tell you that it's no longer in the document.
[11:33:32] <sennahoj> jamov: yeah but 1.9 is stell not complete. And I thought after MS joined, it would speed up a bit
[11:35:41] <snagnever> warreparsons no, it wont =/
[11:36:01] <student1> if in a selectlist, how do i get the value of a given text eveif its not selected?
[11:36:03] <freeed> Hey guys.. is there a mouse event for moving the jog dial on a mouse? Ya know, scrolling up and down?
[11:36:12] <warrenparsons> snagnever: Why won't it?
[11:36:40] <EBisumaru> Hey guys. If I have $("selector").find( ':contains(\'text\(\(text)' ) and it breaks. is there a way around that, or can you not use parens inside :contains?
[11:37:26] <smykes> damnit i didnt fix it
[11:37:52] <snagnever> $elm1 = $('#sameid'); $elm2= ('#sameid'); $elm1.remove(); $elm2.length is 1
[11:38:31] <warrenparsons> snagnever: Yeah, that's because you stored the reference in $elm2 prior to removal, and you're testing the length of your reference, not whether it's in the DOM.
[11:39:05] <student1> var trial=$("#getdropdown option:selected").text();
[11:39:17] <student1> can i pass argument to text() so that i get value for certain text?
[11:39:22] <snagnever> yes. so, i'm testing with .parent().length
[11:39:30] <student1> how how would i achieve it? var trial=$("#getdropdown option:selected").text("mytext");
[11:39:46] <snagnever> student1 passing a value to text will SET the text of the selected option
[11:40:22] <warrenparsons> snagnever: I'm not really getting your core problem. You're running a .remove() on an element, but you don't trust that to actually remove the element, and feel the need to "verify" it?
[11:40:45] <warrenparsons> snagnever: How do you verify the verification?
[11:40:49] <student1> right, this wouldnt work either: var trial = $("#AllECActivities text:BASS").text();
[11:40:53] <e-anima> jea
[11:41:15] <e-anima> warrenparsons i switched to dynatree, seems better
[11:41:25] <warrenparsons> e-anima: Glad to hear you got it worked out.
[11:41:37] <snagnever> warreparson i'm working on a 'infinity scroll'
[11:42:03] <snagnever> when the server return that i have no more results, i delete the #endOfPage div
[11:42:35] <e-anima> not by now but it has callbacks that are documented and overall much better docu taht nstree. http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/doc/dynatree-doc.html#h5.1
[11:42:37] <snagnever> and the 'scroll checker' looks for it before calling the 'loadMorePosts' method
[11:42:44] <warrenparsons> snagnever: Ahh, okay.
[11:43:06] <student1> $("#myselectlist text:mytext").val();
[11:43:16] <student1> how do i achieve smthg like that with jquery?
[11:43:17] <warrenparsons> snagnever: Still, you should be able to check $('#endOfPage').length, and if it's zero (or false), you know the element has been removed.
[11:44:05] <warrenparsons> snagnever: From what you posted, you were checking length of a var containing a reference to #endOfPage, which is not the same thing.
[11:44:21] <snagnever> humn true
[11:44:38] <snagnever> ive kinda of 'cached' the end of page reference
[11:44:58] <warrenparsons> snagnever: Right. And for checking whether it's in the DOM, you don't want the cached reference.
[11:45:29] <snagnever> ok, thx!
[11:45:40] <student1> I got it , had to user attr().val()
[11:46:06] <warrenparsons> snagnever: You're welcome. It's easy to get tripped up with that kind of stuff.
[11:48:35] <arcanez> is it possible to observe when an iframe is updated? (I'm posting a form to it and want to read the results from it)
[11:49:07] <DrShoggoth> I'm using .draggable and .resizable from jquery-ui on a div, I would like to be able to modify the size and position of this div from the code too,  is there something I can hook into that will modify these through jquery-ui instead of managing the div's myself?
[11:49:51] <DrShoggoth> somethign that will cascade down to alsoResize and the like
[11:59:07] <imsky> hngghh
[12:00:58] <thang> yes
[12:01:30] <thang> so question, keyup is fired when the key is released?
[12:02:18] <Pilate> seems like a question easily answered by reading the relevant api page
[12:06:56] <rubyruy> is there some secret way to also reinitialize widgets when they get .clone(true)-ed?
[12:07:03] <rubyruy> the data properties are copied (great)
[12:07:25] <rubyruy> but without re-init each widget's this.element points to the original copy :o
[12:07:41] <rubyruy> google yilelded some discussions on this, but it's from 2009ish
[12:13:27] <student1> this is apparently not working, $('#selectlist').arrt(text,"mytext").val();
[12:13:47] <student1> i am trying to get the value of a particual select text which may or maynot be selected
[12:13:54] <student1> attr
[12:16:18] <student1> $("#selectlist").attr("text", "BASS").val();
[12:16:33] <student1> this is only returning the val for selected item
[12:16:38] <student1> how do i get around it?
[12:17:23] <student1> $("#selectlist option:not(:selected)").attr("text", "BASS").val(); also doesnt help

[12:22:42] <Sandstorm> hey guys, im trying to use jQuery getJSON function, and its working for one site with properly formatted Json , however I cant get it to work with another and i think its because of the jason formatting
[12:22:44] <Sandstorm> https://gist.github.com/1732274
[12:22:47] <anphonic> Is anyone free atm to lend a hand?
[12:23:55] <Eviltwin> ?ask @ anphonic
[12:23:55] <bot-t> anphonic, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:24:18] <Eviltwin> Oh, you mean help help people
[12:24:29] <student1> is there somethign like $("#selectlist option[text='BASS']").val(); ?
[12:25:17] <Sandstorm> Eviltwin, do you know why the JSON formats are different in these two examples? https://gist.github.com/1732274
[12:25:18] <Eviltwin> You mean select by the text content?
[12:25:35] <Sandstorm> specifically, at the first line of each where it either begins with '[' or '{'
[12:25:36] <Eviltwin> Sandstorm: Why they're different?
[12:25:39] <Sandstorm> yea
[12:25:47] <Eviltwin> Is this a philosophical question?
[12:25:51] <Sandstorm> haha no
[12:26:09] <Eviltwin> I mean...they're different
[12:26:17] <Sandstorm> i meant more in the structure
[12:26:21] <Sandstorm> with the [
[12:26:26] <Sandstorm> at the top of good.json
[12:26:26] <Eviltwin> json.org
[12:26:35] <Eviltwin> That explains the formet
[12:26:38] <Eviltwin> format*
[12:27:07] <Sandstorm> why is "Items [ ]
[12:27:23] <Sandstorm> and in the bad example [ { -post
[12:27:32] <anphonic> entire code in html <>  http://jsfiddle.net/KJBdJ/1/   http://goo.gl/ikrWd <--live page  receiveing console error "Cannot read property 'offsetWidth' of undefined" on live page
[12:27:56] <Eviltwin> JSON is a structure
[12:28:01] <anphonic> what is causing the offsetWidth undefined error.
[12:28:10] <Eviltwin> And is very generic and flexible
[12:28:15] <nw`> Sandstorm, it's the comma after the last "}", I think
[12:28:23] <nw`> http://jsonlint.com/
[12:29:01] <Sandstorm> im gona re-edit the gist, but basically 'post' is a resource in one app, and 'items' is a resource in another
[12:29:15] <thang> when binding something to $(document).keyup, the clause i have for the corresponding keyCode is being executed, but the debug message inside the handler and outside the keyCode is only being executed only when i release
[12:29:16] <Sandstorm> however 'items' outputs an entire array with every object
[12:29:27] <Sandstorm> while 'post' is called each time
[12:29:28] <thang> this is happening in chrome, why?
[12:30:00] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ thang
[12:30:00] <bot-t> thang, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[12:36:09] <student1> $("#selectlist option[text='BASS']").val();
[12:36:19] <Eviltwin> I know that you could do it via a .filter function
[12:36:34] <Eviltwin> Perhaps look at this: http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[12:36:43] <Nicedayz> anyone know how to turn off input validation for something like this? http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/icon-trigger.html

[12:36:59] <slorbast> Anyone have a link to a good example of rewriting the contents of a table based on JSON request?
[12:37:22] <slorbast> Err, JSON return information
[12:38:23] <student1> Eviltwin, that worked like a breeze, appreciate it
[12:38:33] <Eviltwin> Note that it does a partial match
[12:38:40] <student1> ok
[12:38:44] <Eviltwin> $("div:contains(Foo)") will match <div>Food</div>
[12:38:53] <Eviltwin> Or <div>My Food</div>

[12:58:51] <Symbi0nt|GER> someone an idea where my thinking mistake is?
[12:59:15] <Eviltwin> When you have "{selector}:eq({x})"
[12:59:20] <Eviltwin> You will always get back 0 or 1 results
[12:59:26] <Eviltwin> What you're looking for is nth-child

[13:00:08] <Symbi0nt|GER> thank you

[13:37:51] <bean__> hello Iam not a very experienced JS-Developer with a simple use case ... I have a site that hase lots of pages with the same layout (just the <nav> tags and one <section> tag content is altering)
[13:38:44] <bean__> I thought of using JQuery templating to not write the same code over and over again .... but It's all resolved at runtime
[13:39:15] <bean__> so my question is (because my template content is always static) is there a way to compile it ?
[13:39:47] <bean__> or is this just not a good solution to do this with jquery tempaltes?

[13:44:52] <Eviltwin> ?ask @ StevenCodes22
[13:44:52] <bot-t> StevenCodes22, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:45:22] <StevenCodes22> Umm hmm how do i stop a form from submitting ?
[13:45:31] <StevenCodes22> like refreshing the page
[13:45:38] <zeunix> e.preventDefault();
[13:45:48] <StevenCodes22> alright and what is e ?
[13:45:58] <Eviltwin> ?event.preventDefault @ StevenCodes22
[13:45:58] <bot-t> StevenCodes22, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[13:46:09] <StevenCodes22> ty
[13:46:15] <zeunix> $('form').submit(function (event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[13:46:29] <StevenCodes22> way better than what i was doign
[13:46:31] <StevenCodes22> :)
[13:46:54] <Eviltwin> If you weren't using preventDefault, there's no way you could have been doing it correctly
[13:47:02] <zeunix> ^^
[13:47:11] <thang> stopPropagation?
[13:47:12] <zeunix> although returning false would work too
[13:47:14] <StevenCodes22> using return false at the end worked pretty well
[13:47:28] <Eviltwin> thang: stopPropagation and preventDefault are two different things and produce two different results
[13:47:32] <zeunix> but it would also prevent any handler bound after that one from firing too
[13:47:38] <Eviltwin> Thus why they are two different thigns
[13:47:40] <Eviltwin> things*
[13:47:47] <zeunix> returning false = preventDefault + stopProp
[13:47:48] <thang> Eviltwin: from what i saw, one prevents bubbling
[13:47:58] <Eviltwin> Correct
[13:48:34] <StevenCodes22> well i put tht int there and it still submitted

[13:49:25] <Log1x> anybody know what im doing wrong with what i posted above? >_<

[13:50:27] * _unary doh
[13:50:39] <StevenCodes22> wait would it matter if i made the form with jquery
[13:50:40] <StevenCodes22> ?
[13:51:10] <zeunix> If you bound the handler before the element exists in the DOM, yes.
[13:51:28] <StevenCodes22> nvm I got it
[13:51:34] <StevenCodes22> live == wonders
[13:51:59] <imachuchu> is there any easy way to have the ajax load method use POST even if given a parameter?
[13:52:03] <warrenparsons> StevenCodes22: It's best to avoid .live(). It's deprecated.
[13:52:13] <StevenCodes22> what aout bind ?
[13:52:37] <warrenparsons> StevenCodes22: .bind() is okay, but it's best to use .on() since that's the standardized event model for 1.7 forward.

[13:52:47] <StevenCodes22> gotcha
[13:53:09] <Sandstorm> anyone understand why this JSON method is wrong? or would not return results
[13:53:10] <Sandstorm> @post = Post.all
[13:53:15] <Sandstorm> https://gist.github.com/1732885
[13:58:34] <imachuchu> sorry GET
[13:59:10] <StevenCodes22> Anyone know why 	$.ajax({type: "POST",url: "ajax_request.php",data: "guid="+ GUID +"&cuid="+ CUID +"&func=91A_3234&gc_msg="+ Message,success: function(data){alert(data);}});     returns XMLobjects
[14:00:02] <Eviltwin> Why it returns that?
[14:00:08] <Eviltwin> Do you know what asychronous programming is?
[14:00:16] <Sandstorm> Eviltwin, does the jQuery look right? https://gist.github.com/1732885
[14:00:58] <imachuchu> Eviltwin: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_programming
[14:00:58] <Eviltwin> $(document.createElement("li")) can simply be $("<li>")
[14:01:02] <zeunix> @Eviltwin lol
[14:01:09] <Eviltwin> imachuchu: Thanks, 'cause I obviously didn't know what it was
[14:01:22] <imachuchu> Eviltwin: ;p
[14:01:42] <StevenCodes22> Eviltwin:   yeah
[14:02:39] <Sandstorm> eviltwin, I think the problem might be in line 8 and 14 in 'getJSON.js' in terms of actually returning the JSON
[14:02:57] <zeunix> @StevenCodes22 Also, you don't need to create the query string like that
[14:03:16] <zeunix> it's rather hard to read. Just create an object and use that.
[14:03:32] <StevenCodes22> zeunix:  Don't follow.
[14:03:39] <jaequery> anyone here had issues with firefox where console.log("bla"); wouldn't put out anything to firefox console?
[14:05:23] <zeunix> $.post('ajax_request.php', { guid: GUID, cuid: CUID, etc: etc }).succes(function () {}).error(function() {});
[14:05:43] <chovy> how do i get the html element?
[14:05:51] <chovy> $(document) seems to be somethign else.
[14:05:59] <Eviltwin> chovy: document.documentElement
[14:06:11] <Eviltwin> But why do you need it?
[14:06:20] <Eviltwin> You shouldn't really be operating at that level
[14:06:33] <StevenCodes22> zeunix:  Do you mind a pm ?
[14:06:44] <chovy> Eviltwin: i want to check for a class name on <html>
[14:07:00] <zeunix> sorry, all discussions should happen in here. public knowledge.
[14:07:03] <chovy> Google font loader adds a class to html tag when the font is loaded.
[14:07:24] <StevenCodes22> Nevermind then :p
[14:07:26] <Eviltwin> I think $("html") works
[14:07:35] <zeunix> you're welcome

[14:08:11] <g0th> how do I append text to a html element with jquery?
[14:08:26] <Sandstorm> how does the function in line 11 of this gist work with function( key, val) ?https://gist.github.com/1732885

[14:08:40] <Eviltwin> And appending one of those
[14:08:44] <chovy> how do i tell if an html element is visible or hidden?
[14:09:05] <g0th> Eviltwin: can you make a small example?
[14:09:09] <g0th> so far I used .text(text)
[14:09:17] <g0th> but that just sets text, it doesn't append text
[14:10:42] <Eviltwin> g0th: $("#foo").append(document.createTextNode("blah"));
[14:10:47] <Eviltwin> Is that small enough?
[14:10:49] <chee> coldhead:
[14:10:51] <chee> wat
[14:11:15] <chee> o lol
[14:11:18] <chee> nm.
[14:12:02] <chovy>       cue.fadeOut().remove();
[14:12:11] <chovy> that that remove() wait until the fadeOut is completed?
[14:12:11] <g0th> Eviltwin: thanks, that looks like what I want :)
[14:12:20] <anjen> g0th: append();
[14:12:34] <anjen> oops too slow
[14:12:48] <g0th> anjen: that's html
[14:13:00] <g0th> Eviltwin: do I need to append a .show() ?
[14:14:04] <g0th> http://pastebin.com/6Jv2e1Lp
[14:14:09] <g0th> hmm I still get an error for this
[14:14:32] <Sandstorm> where is the'val' argument coming from in this post? in the function in line 11?
[14:14:33] <g0th> also without the "."
[14:14:34] <Sandstorm> https://gist.github.com/1732885
[14:14:49] <StevenCodes22> zeunix: any reason it would still return XML object when it should return the letter D

[14:17:09] <loocorez> Hi, anyone know how to call $.ajax without it appending a question mark between the url and data?
[14:17:34] <Eviltwin> loocorez: No, because it doesn't make sense to do that
[14:17:37] <Eviltwin> That's not what data represents
[14:17:39] <StevenCodes22> loocorez:             $.post('ajax_request.php', { guid: GUID, cuid: CUID, func : "91A_3234" }).success(function (data) {alert(data);}).error(function() {});

[14:19:49] <StevenCodes22> loocorez:  np
[14:20:41] <zeunix> @StevenCodes22 responseText is the member containing the actual string response (html, etc)

[14:28:09] <imachuchu> is there anyway to get the .load method to use GET even if given an argument?
[14:28:32] <imachuchu> *any way
[14:29:11] <Eviltwin> imachuchu: You simply do the concatenation yourself or don't use .load
[14:29:20] <imachuchu> kk that's what I though
[14:32:59] <g0th> Eviltwin: ok, how do I delete that text again?
[14:33:07] <g0th> Eviltwin: .text("") ?
[14:33:16] <Eviltwin> Whatever floats your boat
[14:33:28] <g0th> ok
[14:33:30] <g0th> sry
[14:33:37] <g0th> I was asking because .text() was not working
[14:33:44] <g0th> then after I wrote my question I realized
[14:33:48] <g0th> that .text() returns the text ^^
[14:57:45] <DrShoggoth> does : this.$( '#someid' ) === $(this).find('#someid')  ?
[14:59:31] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[14:59:41] <Eviltwin> For most situations this.$ will be undefined
[15:00:08] <Eviltwin> And you're only allowed one element with a given ID per document
[15:00:38] <chovy> what does this.$ do?
[15:00:55] <chovy> i'm assuming that is the same as window.$ ?
[15:01:21] <Eviltwin> If this === window
[15:01:32] <DrShoggoth> sorry, was confused
[15:01:37] <chovy> yeah
[15:01:43] <chovy> otherwise this.$ would be undef
[15:02:40] <Surrealis> when is the :visible  tag set?
[15:02:56] <Eviltwin> :visible isn't a tag
[15:03:00] <Eviltwin> It's a pseudo selector
[15:03:01] <Surrealis> selector
[15:03:09] <Eviltwin> Selectors aren't "set"
[15:03:16] <Surrealis> ummm
[15:03:22] <Surrealis> okay
[15:03:25] <StevenCodes22> Anyone mind a PM that is good with jQuery I can't really give out product details
[15:03:44] <Eviltwin> What would setting a selector mean/
[15:03:53] <chovy> Surrealis: in contract <div style="display: none;">  $(div).is(":hidden") == true, $(div).is(":visible") == false.
[15:04:04] <chovy> contrast*
[15:04:07] <Surrealis> so :visible is returning back true, despite the fact that it is hidden
[15:04:12] <Eviltwin> ?:selected @ Surrealis
[15:04:12] <bot-t> Surrealis, :selected: Selects all elements that are selected. http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[15:04:15] <Eviltwin> Err
[15:04:18] <Eviltwin> ?:visible @ Surrealis
[15:04:19] <bot-t> Surrealis, :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[15:04:34] <chovy> Surrealis: can you jsfiddle?
[15:04:42] <Surrealis> indeed
[15:09:55] <Surrealis> what my problem is i have multiple sets of parent/child/grandchild div blocks, and onload some are shown and some are hidden, but even the when a parent hides a child, if the child has the correct selection, the grandchild still shows the parent and the grandchild, but hids the child and i have :visible return back as true for the child despite it is very obviously not
[15:10:38] <Eviltwin> We asked for a jsFiddle
[15:10:45] <Eviltwin> Illustrating your problem
[15:11:06] <Surrealis> indeed, i was giving the "functional requirement" i'm cleaning up the jsfiddle now
[15:11:43] <chovy> my head hurts.
[15:11:43] <StevenCodes22>  Eviltwin Would you mind a PM ?
[15:12:41] <Eviltwin> StevenCodes22: Yes
[15:12:45] <Eviltwin> I would mind
[15:12:50] <StevenCodes22> Alright

[15:22:15] <tome> Hi all, I've got a click handler that's on a table, and checks if a checkbox in that table was clicked. In that handler, if a checkbox is clicked, I open a dialog, do an ajax call, and then destroy the dialog once the callback succeeds. I'm seeing strange behavior where, if I open the dialog as Modal, the actual checkbox click doesn't seem to take effect (the checkbox state doesn't toggle), but if I switch that dialog to non-m
[15:22:15] <tome> odal, everything works. I'm not really sure where to continue looking, all my functions return true (don't stop the bubbling), and just changing modal/non-modal is enough to expose the behavior.
[15:22:54] <tome> any have any ideas?
[15:26:36] <chovy> tome: are you using e.preventDefault() ?
[15:27:26] <chovy> if that isn't it, then just do $(this).checked('true');
[15:27:41] <chovy> sorry, $(this).attr('checked', true);
[15:32:30] <tome> chovy: I am not using preventDefault directly, and I am also returning true from my handlers to avoid that too.
[15:33:06] <tome> chovy: but I don't understand why opening the dialog modal/non-modal has anything to do with this... something strange right?
[15:41:25] <tome> (also when I look at the event object, default is not prevented.
[15:44:35] <tome> and bubbles is set to true
[15:44:36] <Sandstorm> what is the 'key' in the callback in line 11 here? https://gist.github.com/1732885
[15:44:50] <Eviltwin> ?.each @ Sandstorm
[15:44:51] <bot-t> Sandstorm, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[15:45:26] <Sandstorm> did bot -t actually open the file and look at that or is that a person?
[15:45:49] <Eviltwin> He's pretty fast
[15:45:54] <Sandstorm> lol
[15:45:57] <Sandstorm> smoking
[15:46:38] <Sandstorm> wait so what is 'va' in the second argument of the callback?
[15:46:44] <Sandstorm> 'val'
[15:46:49] <Eviltwin> Dude, read
[15:47:03] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[15:47:49] <tome> I'm going to have to create a small repro of this. It is very strange that modal matters...
[15:48:11] <chovy> tome: returning true might have unintended consequences.
[15:48:16] <chovy> try removing it.
[15:48:24] <tome> chovy: cool, will do
[15:48:39] <Sandstorm> would val mean 'this', so in this case, 'this' refers to the current li?
[15:49:15] <chovy> tome: put it on jsfiddle and we'll look
[15:49:38] <tome> chovy: didn't work. What I see is that in the handler itself, the checkmark is properly set. But then after it finishes with the event handle (but before the callback from the ajax comes back), the checkbox is re-checked...
[15:49:49] <tome> (or re-unchecked, etc.)
[15:50:16] <tome> chovy: yeah I'll break down and repro. Likely it'll all be clear then. The code I'm running is a little tangled.
[15:50:53] <niels__> I have a small timer.php, which is getting pulled to index.php through AJAX. The Ajax works fine, but it only shows the "Loading.." text. When I run timer.php alone, the count function works perfectly fine. Why is that? Any ideas? Look here http://pastebin.com/xSVM8P8T :)
[15:53:17] <Eviltwin> Why are you using PHP for this...
[15:54:53] <niels__> Eviltwin: Because I have lots of session variables i need.
[15:55:01] <chovy> what does countTo do?
[15:55:27] <niels__> chovy: count from 0 to a random number, which is in the session variable.
[15:55:54] <chovy> beneath are timer.php, which is getting pulled to index.php through AJAX
[15:55:55] * _unary Computer has gone to sleep.
[15:56:00] <chovy> i don't see any ajax in there.
[15:56:03] <Eviltwin> So you're uding PHP to generate random numbers?
[15:56:21] <chovy> Math.random()
[15:56:49] <niels__> Eviltwin: No, it's not a random random number. It's a number getting calculated from SQL.
[15:57:29] <niels__> chovy: the ajax is in the index file, nevermind that, it works perfectly fine. It just won't pass the other than standard text, it won't pass the script.
[15:58:08] <Eviltwin> niels__: ...
[15:58:24] <niels__> Eviltwin: ?
[15:58:30] <chovy> your ajax call returns a script tag?
[15:58:44] <niels__> chovy: yes, it returns all of it
[15:58:54] <niels__> chovy: but the script wont run, like when i run it by itself
[15:58:59] <chovy> i've had issues with returning <script> in ajax.
[15:59:10] <niels__> chovy: how did you fix it?
[15:59:12] <chovy> Can I see your ajax call?
[15:59:20] <niels__> sure hold on
[15:59:45] <chovy> niels__: I just moved the script tag out to the encompassing page with a method that the ajax success handler can call.
[16:00:02] <talntid> Anyone here familiar with uploadify? I have a page where it uploads files, and I want to post to the next page, what files were uploaded... but $_FILES doesn't have anything in it....... ideas? =)
[16:00:09] <Eviltwin> When you inject <script> HTML into an element, it gets executed. When you inject <script> elements into an element, nothing happens
[16:00:26] <Eviltwin> At least with jQuery
[16:00:31] <niels__> chovy: http://pastebin.com/TbNhCiJf
[16:00:45] <niels__> Eviltwin: So,what do you suggest?
[16:00:50] <Eviltwin> niels__: Why aren't you using $.ajax for this?
[16:01:04] <chovy> Eviltwin: what do you mean?
[16:01:13] <niels__> Eviltwin: I have absolutely no idea, i started on jquery last week.
[16:01:27] <Eviltwin> I suggest you try $("#counttimer").html(xmlhttp.responseText); instead of line 17
[16:01:31] <Eviltwin> For starters
[16:01:38] <Eviltwin> Then see ?$.ajax
[16:01:39] <bot-t> Eviltwin, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[16:01:41] <chovy> niels__: why not use jquery?
[16:01:45] <Eviltwin> Which simplifies the messiness of AJAX
[16:02:06] <niels__> thanks, i'll have a look
[16:02:12] <niels__> but that won't really change my problem, would it?
[16:02:13] <chovy> $.get('timer.php', function(htm) { $("#foo").html( htm ) });
[16:02:27] <chovy> that might fix your problem.
[16:02:31] <Eviltwin> niels__: Switching to $.ajax wouldn't, but using .html might
[16:03:01] <niels__> Eviltwin: but that's not really an option
[16:03:17] <niels__> chovy: what does that do?
[16:03:25] <Eviltwin> That's not an option?
[16:03:29] <Eviltwin> What?
[16:03:41] <Eviltwin> Okay
[16:03:47] <Eviltwin> Let me explain your problem to you
[16:03:56] <Eviltwin> Browsers by default try to prevent accidental script injection
[16:03:57] <chovy> niels__: it's a shortcut for $.ajax
[16:04:04] <chovy> if all you need is a GET request.
[16:04:12] <Eviltwin> i.e. you se the .innerHTML of an element and that HTML contains a script tag with the intent of running JavaScript
[16:04:18] <chovy> it takes the response htm and puts it into the dom somewhere (#foo)
[16:04:26] <Eviltwin> Most browsers will just not run that JavaScript
[16:04:26] <niels__> Sure
[16:04:32] <Eviltwin> Which is the problem you're experiencing
[16:04:39] <niels__> ah, makes sense
[16:04:55] <Eviltwin> To force browsers to execute it, you can take all of your script tags from it, make new ones, set their .text / .textContent and add them to the <head>
[16:05:01] <Eviltwin> And guess what
[16:05:09] <Eviltwin> jQuery's .html does that for you
[16:05:16] <Eviltwin> So why is that not an option?
[16:05:19] <StevenCodes22> Can someone show me an example of like making a button on the top right of an image with jquery than making a slidout when you click it ?
[16:05:19] <Eviltwin> You're clearly already using jQuery
[16:05:30] <niels__> Because i misunderstood you, that's why.
[16:05:39] <niels__> :)
[16:07:20] <niels__> Eviltwin: lol $("#countertimer").html(xmlhttp.responseText); fixed it.
[16:07:29] <niels__> Eviltwin: I didn't change a single line other than that.

[16:23:26] <kara_sweets> yea, but how would i get it to return the values in post
[16:23:49] <Eviltwin> kara_sweets: Instead of function(val) { ... } use function(key, val) { ... }
[16:24:02] <kara_sweets> aww ok, now that it's added the page returns [object Object]
[16:24:07] <kara_sweets> instead of 'post'
[16:24:14] <kara_sweets> with val in the same spot
[16:24:25] <Eviltwin> Yes because according to your structure, "post" is an object
[16:24:46] <kara_sweets> correct, and is there a way to show the attributes of the object>
[16:24:52] <Eviltwin> I suspect what you want is $.each(data.post, function(key, val) { ... })
[16:25:22] <kara_sweets> eiltwin, you just made my day
[16:25:26] <kara_sweets> booya
[16:25:28] <kara_sweets> yea it works
[16:25:33] <kara_sweets> just returned the whole object
[16:26:46] <kara_sweets> is there a way to pin a specific value? like value.title ?
[16:26:54] <Eviltwin> To "pin" it?
[16:27:08] <kara_sweets> erm, bad word usage, like if i only wanted to display the title
[16:27:13] <kara_sweets> the value of the title
[16:27:18] <kara_sweets> and not the value of the entire object
[16:27:19] <Eviltwin> I don't see a title in your object
[16:27:39] <kara_sweets> company
[16:27:43] <kara_sweets> my bad
[16:27:43] <Eviltwin> You only need $.each if you're trying to do the same thing multiple times
[16:27:47] <tome> chovy: I can't reproduce it yet in jsfiddle. I'm guessing there is some other code that I've got loaded that
[16:27:53] <tome> s interfering...
[16:28:06] <tome> thanks for your help
[16:28:15] <Eviltwin> Otherwise you can do something like items.push("<li>" + data.posts.company + "</li>");
[16:28:21] <Eviltwin> For just that one value
[16:28:44] <kara_sweets> do you mean you only need data.each if you have multiple post objects?
[16:29:02] <Eviltwin> .each is designed to run the same code for everything in the collection
[16:29:06] <ch3mi0n> .. test
[16:29:09] <ch3mi0n> >> test
[16:29:15] <Eviltwin> Like $.each([1,2,3], function() { ... })
[16:29:18] <Eviltwin> The ... gets run 3 times
[16:29:25] <Eviltwin> Once for each of those numbers there
[16:29:38] <Eviltwin> If your goal is to only show the company at this point
[16:29:43] <Eviltwin> No need to go to each of those
[16:30:05] <Eviltwin> If you do data.post.company in your function, you will get "Ernst & Young"
[16:32:08] <kara_sweets> awww nice,
[16:32:27] <kara_sweets> i just added the rest of the post objects in an now the line from before, just data.post, isnt returning them
[16:34:30] <Eviltwin> kara_sweets: Let's do this here so I can see the code you wrote and the result for myself: http://jsfiddle.net/muU39/
[16:34:40] <Eviltwin> Just make the changes, press Update, and give me the new link
[16:34:49] <kara_sweets> ok cool thanks
[16:37:12] <kara_sweets> http://jsfiddle.net/muU39/1/
[16:37:28] <tome> Hi all, still debugging this. When I click this checkbox, if I have a handler on the 'change' event for my checkbox, I see it being called 4-5 times (with each actual mouse click). That indicates something is quite wrong in my setup right?
[16:37:49] <kara_sweets> looks like its only evaluating the last object
[16:37:51] <Eviltwin> So one thing, is that you can't have more than one of the same key in an object, you'll need to use an array instead
[16:37:56] <BartjeNL> hi all
[16:38:10] <kara_sweets> oooo
[16:38:33] <BartjeNL> does somebody help me with my jquery plugin? i'm trying to find a way to do this callback function
[16:38:47] <BartjeNL> *can
[16:39:10] <kara_sweets> is that sometime i need to change with the ouput of the JSON via Rails, or something that can be manipulated using javascript?
[16:39:11] <enjo58> Is there a psuedo selector for determining wether css visibility is 'hidden' or not...similar to $().is(':visible') ?
[16:39:51] <Eviltwin> enjo58: You guessed it
[16:39:53] <Eviltwin> kara_sweets: http://jsfiddle.net/muU39/2/
[16:40:20] <enjo58> Eviltwin: is(':visible') does not return false for elements that are merely hidden, only display: none;
[16:40:30] <tome> Hi all, is there some way to determine the cause of a change event?
[16:40:31] <enjo58> At least according to my reading of the docs
[16:40:41] <Eviltwin> enjo58: You mean input[type=hidden]?
[16:41:21] <BartjeNL> i'm wondering if it is possible to have something like this: http://pastebin.com/zKnaiP95
[16:41:21] <enjo58> no..the equivalent of $('#elem').css('visibility', 'hidden').is(':hidden');   (that will be false)
[16:41:37] <Eviltwin> enjo58: The reasoning is explained right here: http://api.jquery.com/hidden-selector/
[16:41:52] <kara_sweets> hmm eviltwin, what if the post is part of the JSON and I cant remove it?
[16:42:06] <Eviltwin> kara_sweets: Are there more than one of them?
[16:42:09] <Eviltwin> Like you showed?
[16:42:11] <kara_sweets> yes
[16:42:19] <Eviltwin> Then it's invalid JSON
[16:42:33] <Eviltwin> Probably won't be parseable by JavaScript
[16:42:40] <enjo58> I get the reasoning..I'm just looking for something to nicely tell me wether visibility is 'hidden' or not:) It's a clunky check otherwise... looking for something nicer.
[16:42:52] <Eviltwin> .css("visibility") === "hidden"
[16:44:08] <BartjeNL> can someone please help me with this ?
[16:44:34] <kara_sweets> so this is invalid JSON? https://gist.github.com/1733985
[16:44:37] <Eviltwin> BartjeNL: It's valid JavaScript if it's wrapped in a pair of {}'s
[16:44:45] <Eviltwin> Excepy for possibly the trailing comma
[16:44:48] <Eviltwin> Depending on the browser
[16:45:01] <Eviltwin> kara_sweets: No, but that's not what you put in the jsFiddle
[16:45:02] <BartjeNL> Yea but i'm not quite sure how to handle this
[16:45:06] <BartjeNL> inside my plugin eviltwin
[16:45:22] <kara_sweets> oo sorry, wasnt sure how to translate that to the variable
[16:46:06] <Eviltwin> kara_sweets: http://jsfiddle.net/muU39/3/
[16:46:42] <Eviltwin> BartjeNL: Uh...however your plugin should handle it?
[16:46:44] <Eviltwin> I don't understand the question
[16:47:12] <kara_sweets> awwww
[16:47:21] <kara_sweets> and the FINAL question,
[16:47:30] <kara_sweets> how to only display one of the value attributes
[16:47:33] <BartjeNL> Eviltwin: the plugin creates icons (images), and when each image is clicked i want to have a custom callback
[16:47:35] <Eviltwin> "awww" is like "awww, that's two bad" or "awww, that's cute"
[16:47:37] <Eviltwin> "ahhh
[16:47:37] <kara_sweets> value.title?
[16:47:40] <kara_sweets> ahhh
[16:47:42] <kara_sweets> you're right
[16:47:49] <fission6> how would i catch a form submit, wait 2 seconds then submit it
[16:47:59] <BartjeNL> .delay?
[16:48:10] <kara_sweets> how did you get so good javascript ?? its hard
[16:48:22] <Eviltwin> kara_sweets: Practice makes perfect
[16:48:24] <makiren> practice and time
[16:48:34] <kara_sweets> the syntax sometimes is like wtf
[16:48:41] <kara_sweets> especially with callbacks
[16:48:57] <BartjeNL> but yea how can i create callback functions for each indiviual entry ?
[16:49:17] <makiren> kara_sweets: You can learn a lot very quickly when forced to.
[16:49:54] <abjorn> Ahhhhh no more tech support, no more customers. Feels good
[16:49:54] <Eviltwin> fission6: It would work kind of like this but with setTimeout instead of $.ajax: http://jsfiddle.net/h54dd/
[16:50:05] <coldhead> congrats abjorn !
[16:50:12] <coldhead> happy days
[16:50:12] <abjorn> thanks coldhod

[16:50:52] <makiren> I do a lot of web stuff, building sites but I feel far from legit :|
[16:50:53] <kara_sweets> in a way the curly braces, keep you focused on the function within, but when they're all embedded it starts getting crazy
[16:51:00] <fission6> Eviltwin: thanks
[16:51:16] <coldhead> you aren't really legit until you write your own kernel
[16:51:29] <coldhead> that's what esr told me anyway

[16:51:54] <Eviltwin> You aren't legit until you're built your own Turing machine with infinite tape
[16:51:58] <abjorn> makiren: I know, I never felt legit as a freelancer rofl
[16:52:14] <makiren> you'd sorta think about 15+ years of "playing" with html+ i'd know more

[16:52:41] <Eviltwin> It might take a while
[16:52:52] <abjorn> rofl

[16:53:13] <fission6> Eviltwin: like this http://jsfiddle.net/h54dd/1/
[16:53:13] <abjorn> might have a shortage crisis on our hands
[16:53:19] <abjorn> wait, nevermind, no one uses tape anymore
[16:53:21] <makiren> abjorn: I'm not a freelancer, i am "the team" for a small company, when they people you work with all have "manager" titles lol
[16:53:28] <abjorn> lol
[16:53:34] <Eviltwin> fission6: Not even close

[16:55:29] <tome> WHoo! Hoo! I recreated my checkbox-no-checked bug
[16:55:43] <tome> on jsfiddle
[16:56:24] <Eviltwin> tome: Most people don't celebrate reproducing bugs
[16:56:28] <tome> I think it's somehow related to opening a modal dialog from a modal dialog?
[16:56:29] <makiren> ^^
[16:56:33] <Eviltwin> Most people celebrate bugs being unreproduceable
[16:56:38] <Eviltwin> And thus not bugs
[16:56:42] <tome> those people are insane hehe
[16:56:57] <tome> if you see it one time, your customer will see it as well
[16:57:10] <tome> it's like a truism, every bug you ignore, your customer will see
[16:57:24] <Eviltwin> It's not a bug unless it's reproduceable
[16:57:33] <makiren> <3 my current marjo project. nothing quite like a multitude of version of jquery, many plugins, mootools, and customs js scripts to make adding anything new fun
[16:58:19] <kara_sweets> Eviltwin, almost got it! but now its printing every letter on a new line for compnay,  http://jsfiddle.net/muU39/5/
[16:58:32] <tome> Eviltwin: makiren, I have it in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/tome/aDZtQ/26/     If you click the checkbox, the checkmark doesn't actually have its value changed... Any ideas where my code messes it up?

[16:59:00] <bot-t> tome, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[16:59:32] <tome> haha, too true, too truw
[16:59:40] <tome> it started small  : /
[16:59:59] <kara_sweets> legendary
[17:00:24] <Eviltwin> tome: You need to learn to isolate the error

[17:00:28] <tome> ?pdmjfm
[17:00:30] <bot-t> tome, Couldn't find "pdmjfm" in jQuery Docs.
[17:00:38] <kara_sweets> bot-t, thanks!
[17:00:38] <bot-t> kara_sweets, I'm a bot you know..
[17:00:49] <Eviltwin> We're here to help you resolve the error once you've isolated it
[17:00:50] <makiren> you're lucky it started that way, mine started with "build us CNN.com, oh btw, you have 14 days, 3 of which are holidays"
[17:02:30] <imanc> so $().html() gets the inner html… but how can I get all the html for a particular element, including the outer tags?
[17:02:58] <Eviltwin> imanc: There's no built-in jQuery method for it
[17:03:05] <imanc> hmmm
[17:03:06] <Eviltwin> The DOM (at least in most browsers) has the .outerHTML property
[17:03:18] <fission6> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/TG6xQ/1/ seesm to submit the form right away
[17:03:24] <rubyruy> .parent().html() is reasonably terse
[17:03:29] <Eviltwin> But usually if you're using it, you've done something wrong in your design
[17:03:47] <Eviltwin> fission6: ...
[17:03:59] <Eviltwin> If by right away you mean 3 seconds
[17:04:10] <imanc> rubyruy: nah, I'm grabbing a table row and that grabs the entire table
[17:04:23] <Eviltwin> Actually never in this case
[17:04:27] <Eviltwin> Because you broke it
[17:04:35] <Eviltwin> I didn't put code there for shits and giggles
[17:04:41] <rubyruy> oh herp derp yeah
[17:04:43] <Eviltwin> There was nothing unnecessary in my code
[17:04:52] <Eviltwin> And then you removed some of it
[17:05:17] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/TG6xQ/
[17:06:44] <fission6> Eviltwin: its instant
[17:08:16] <fission6> Eviltwin: that works, i got rid of the checkDefault
[17:10:50] <fission6> Eviltwin: added this one line to fadein a div while the time out happens, when i ad this line the submit doesnt work
[17:14:03] <tome_> Hi all, I've reduced the repro: http://jsfiddle.net/tome/aV6zW/7/   Basically I create a modal dialog, then within it I create a checkbox, and another modal when it's clicked. For some reason the two modals stop the checkbox from being toggled. Just changing the modal dialog to non-modal leads to the right behavior... Is this a jquery issue do you think?
[17:15:47] <JAAulde> Sup yos?
[17:16:05] * JAAulde is sleepy
[17:16:09] <tome_> http://jsfiddle.net/tome/aV6zW/9/   <-- better link even
[17:26:27] <tome_> What's strange is that the bad behavior only shows up if I create the dialog, and then try to destroy it in an ajax callback. Just creating and destroying it doesn't cause the issue.
[17:28:14] <Anphonic> leave out the ajax?
[17:28:31] <tome_> without the ajax, I don't see the same behavior (the checkbox remains toggled)
[17:28:47] <Blaster> hey anyone know why the callback function doesn't execute in this code on IE but works everywhere else?   http://pastebin.com/Z3FuyGzF
[17:30:53] <tome_> Anphonic: Sadly, the ajax is needed to actually toggle state on the server, and the modal dialog tells the user 'Wait... Updating Server...'
[17:31:56] <Anphonic> tome_: ah gotcha
[17:32:24] <tome_> Anphonic: though it doesn't Have to be modal... but I was thinking there may be a jquery bug (or more likely, an opportunity for me to learn)
[17:32:37] <a|3x> hi
[17:33:31] <CantUnplug> hi
[17:35:45] <a|3x> i am using $('#y').load('x #y') and it puts a duplicate y inside y, i think that shouldn't be happening
[17:41:30] <a|3x> so does anyone have any ideas about my problem?
[17:42:44] <dilvie> a|3x: not enough love?
[17:42:56] <a|3x> huh?
[17:43:35] <dilvie> try $('#y').load('x'); ?
[17:43:54] <a|3x> well that would duplicate even more things
[17:44:18] <Anphonic> tome_: possibly .append then .remove a span/paragraph for now?
[17:44:39] <a|3x> by the way, how would it be possible to write something like this $(document?).load('x')?
[17:44:54] <dilvie> a|3x: Did you try it?
[17:45:09] <a|3x> that last thing gave me errors
[17:45:15] <dilvie> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[17:45:38] <dilvie> the stuff you pass into load is the data source of the content you're trying to load.
[17:46:11] <dilvie> passing the id of the destination in as an argument doesn't make sense.
[17:46:35] <a|3x> x is url
[17:46:42] <a|3x> y is div
[17:47:18] <dilvie> $('#y').load(x);
[17:47:29] <dilvie> go, try, do.
[17:47:40] <dilvie> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[17:47:51] <Anphonic> learn, be happy :)
[17:47:58] <dilvie> exactly.
[17:48:09] <dilvie> not enough love. );
[17:48:10] <Blaster> Any reason the $.post wouldn't trigger the callback on IE9 ? http://pastebin.com/Z3FuyGzF
[17:48:11] <dilvie> <3
[17:48:51] <a|3x> well hello if i don't specify the div id wound't it load the whole page into #y?
[17:50:53] <dilvie> yes
[17:51:49] <dilvie> $('#result').load('ajax/test.html #container');
[17:52:28] <dilvie> make sure the #container is a valid target, and you're not trying to load the contents of #y from the same page into #y. =)
[17:52:47] <dilvie> if that doesn't help, post a fiddle jsfiddle.net
[17:53:27] <a|3x> what if i am on ajax/test.html and i am trying to load into #container another #container from ajax/test.html
[17:55:09] <Anphonic> i SHOULD still load from the source into destination
[18:01:24] <tome> Anyone had the inkling to look into that jsfiddle of the modal dialog opening a modal dialog? http://jsfiddle.net/tome/aV6zW/9/    It's as slim as it can be to repro the issue... Perhaps my problem is that I'm creating dialogs from nodes that I create via jquery, and not ones that are present in the DOM directly?
[18:07:18] * tome slinks away
[18:09:11] <dilvie> a|3x: Don't use load for that. $('#result').html($('#container').html());
[18:10:24] <dilvie> a|3x: Even better, populate both #result and #container using the same model data, hooked up with change event handlers... but that's a much deeper topic, and the subject of a book. =)
[18:26:39] <masterbee> evening everyone. Just saying hello
[18:37:37] <Blaster> Anyone know how to make the ajax callback function work in IE 7 ?
[18:39:09] <systemfault> It works fine.. your code has a problem.
[18:40:04] <Blaster> do you see an issue? http://pastebin.com/N1HXP8Cj
[18:42:38] <systemfault> Nothing obvious
[18:42:49] <systemfault> What does the console tells you?
[18:44:32] <Blaster> im not getting any output in the console
[18:44:54] <Blaster> BTW are you talking about Developer Tools in ie 8?
[18:45:06] <systemfault> Yeah...
[18:45:56] <Blaster> Is no output good or bad sign?
[18:46:02] <systemfault> Bad.
[18:46:11] <systemfault> Like if nothing is executed...
[18:47:19] <Blaster> it doesnt seem any pages are giving me output in the console part of the script tab
[18:49:47] <Blaster> in firefox i see all the get requests
[18:50:32] <systemfault> Blaster: Try using console.log statements instead of the useless alerts.
[18:51:06] <Blaster> You're talking in my success callback?
[18:51:35] <systemfault> Right
[18:51:48] <systemfault> You could even try to add one before the ajax call..
[18:51:55] <systemfault> So you can see if it even gets there
[18:55:43] <Blaster> Yes it gets there
[18:56:13] <systemfault> hmm`
[18:57:29] <Blaster> Yeah it's confusing
[18:57:42] <Blaster> And I get the alerts properly on IE 8 and Firefox
[18:58:12] <MistuhKurtz> is it possible to loop through a list of elements and create an object out of them? Like, the <li>s in a <ul>, and make each of them a sub-object of an "accordion" object?
[18:59:28] <Whirl3d> ?.each@MistuhKurtz
[18:59:29] <bot-t> MistuhKurtz, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[18:59:42] <Blaster> systemfault: Would it help if I jsfiddled it?
[18:59:45] <Whirl3d> or maybe .map
[18:59:46] <MistuhKurtz> yes i'm using each
[18:59:55] <MistuhKurtz> hold on let me isolate and put on jsfiddle
[19:00:06] <systemfault> Blaster: Sure.
[19:00:30] <MistuhKurtz> i'm trying to create a vertical accordion, and if you click one element when another one is open, i want the other one to close first before opening the target
[19:00:48] <jexmex> this may be a bit generic, but will this work as I expect it to: $(this['events']['event']).each(function(p, event) {
[19:01:02] <jexmex> from a json source
[19:01:11] <MistuhKurtz> I've got it working but i'm manually constructing the object, i'd like to abstract it
[19:02:03] <systemfault> jexmex: I don't understand what you're trying to do..
[19:03:24] <jexmex> have a json structure like this event-groups -> event-group -> events ->event, I need to run through each event-group and event, I was trying to do it without adding a second foreach for the event-groups and events, as all they do is contain multiple event-group and event nodes (respectevly)
[19:06:07] <MistuhKurtz> Whirl3d, http://jsfiddle.net/kvcrawford/5gEew/
[19:06:15] <MistuhKurtz> I have a feeling I'm approaching it totally wrong
[19:06:16] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[19:06:29] <MistuhKurtz> the two right-most panels are semi-working
[19:06:43] <MistuhKurtz> ive' only tested it in firefox
[19:07:31] <tome> jexmex: doesn't it seem easier to just have nested foreach? How many events are you planning on handling?
[19:08:04] <jexmex> well already have nested within nested, I mean I just thought it might be cleaner like that
[19:08:09] <jexmex> not used to all this nesting
[19:08:13] <devnu> I am using the above jquery script to load a div informing the user that ajax is connecting to the server... I want this to happen on most requests... however there are a few requests I don't want this to happen on. Does anyone know how I might go about filtering it.  http://bin.cakephp.org/view/797712222
[19:08:17] <MistuhKurtz> http://jsfiddle.net/kvcrawford/5gEew/1/ added e.preventDefault() so that it doesn't wig out with the scroll bars when the links are clicked.
[19:08:35] <jexmex> events could number 0-50
[19:08:38] <jexmex> roughly
[19:10:56] <MistuhKurtz> Anybody have any pointers for an appropriate way to approach this?
[19:16:15] <Blaster> can syntax errors prevent the ajax callback in IE 7?
[19:16:24] <Blaster> But work fine everywhere else?
[19:17:40] <tome> Blaster: maybe trailing comma?
[19:18:43] <tome> Blaster: Every one in a while jslint comes in handy: http://www.jslint.com/
[19:20:55] <Blaster> jslint shows a lot of problems, but is it a little over detective?
[19:21:20] <systemfault> Blaster: Paste the javascript somewhere..
[19:21:43] <systemfault> Blaster: jslint sucks... too opinionated to my tastes.
[19:22:18] <joshsmith> is there some way to do something like a :not:contains?
[19:22:27] <systemfault> But like tome said... the damn trailing colon bug on IE7 is common
[19:23:14] <joshsmith> I want to do something like .find('.class:not:contains('sometext')')
[19:23:45] <Blaster> the code in question starts at line 92
[19:23:46] <Blaster> http://pastebin.com/YkXi78Fq
[19:24:20] <tome> joshsmith: are you trying to find an element that does not have a certain class
[19:24:34] <tome> sorry nevermind... got it,
[19:24:39] <joshsmith> tome: no I'm trying to find an element that does not contain certain text
[19:24:52] <sente> Blaster: there's a better way to do that
[19:24:55] <joshsmith> basically I'm trying to do a simple search through li's
[19:25:04] <joshsmith> and hide the li's that don't contain that text
[19:25:08] <sente> but yes, jslint is basically anal as hell
[19:25:51] <joshsmith> jshint > jslint
[19:26:57] <tome> joshsmith: I think :not should work   :not(:contains)
[19:27:05] <tome> (this is just by looking at doc, I haven't tried it)
[19:27:42] <tome> "All selectors are accepted inside :not()"
[19:28:08] <Eviltwin> fission6: Did you ever figure out what you needed?
[19:28:12] <joshsmith> you're' right, tome
[19:28:13] <joshsmith> thanks!
[19:28:15] <Blaster> sente: A better way to do what?
[19:29:38] <Blaster> Better way to do this that works in IE 7?  http://pastebin.com/b3q0MET1
[19:30:59] <Eviltwin> $.ajax({ type: "GET", url: "/ajax/add_entry", data: { "name": name.val(), "phone": phone.val(), "email": email.val() }, ... })
[19:32:00] <tome> ++
[19:33:24] <Blaster> Nice.  Is the ... the callback?
[19:34:41] <Eviltwin> It's the dataType, cache, success
[19:34:51] <Eviltwin> Those don't need to change
[19:35:29] <Blaster> oh ok so something like this? $.ajax({ type: "GET", url: "/ajax/add_entry", data: { "name": name.val(), "phone": phone.val(), "email": email.val() }, success: function(data) { console.log(data.status) })
[19:35:42] <joshsmith> hmm I'm doing this :not(:contains('text')), but is there any easy way to make that case-insensitive
[19:35:45] <Blaster> my php page shoots out json encoded array with a status key
[19:37:19] <Eviltwin> Then you can use dataType: "json"
[19:38:47] <Blaster> oh ok, so dataType then success: function(data) { ... }
[19:38:52] <Blaster> let me test it
[19:40:11] <Blaster> ok it works in Firefox
[19:40:23] <joshsmith> nevermind on my earlier question ^
[19:40:30] <Blaster> on to the wonderful Microsoft family of browsers...
[19:41:35] <Blaster> How come it seems IE always caches everything?
[19:42:18] <tome> what specifically is it caching that you don't expect? (curious)
[19:42:51] <Blaster> Wait, I just tried your code Eviltwin, and again, no output in IE 7 console.log, but works fine everywhere else..
[19:43:12] <Blaster> and I know the code is getting to that point because I added a breakpoint right before the ajaz query and it does output that
[19:43:17] <Blaster> ajax8
[19:43:37] <tome> does it send the ajax request out?
[19:44:28] <Blaster> I'm having trouble determining that in IE Developer Tools.  In Firefox's Web Console it shows me the GET request
[19:44:45] <Blaster> Do I need to go to profiler or something?
[19:44:47] <tome> doesn't it have a network tab of some sort
[19:44:54] <tome> so you can see all the in/out requests
[19:45:01] <Blaster> HTML, CSS, Script, and Profiler tabs
[19:45:10] <systemfault> Blaster: Add a error handler
[19:45:22] * tome wisdom
[19:45:37] <Blaster> Not quite sure what an error handler is, let me google it
[19:45:38] <systemfault> Blaster: I mean.. to your ajax request
[19:45:45] <Blaster> ohh
[19:45:47] <Blaster> error: function()
[19:45:50] <Blaster> { ... }
[19:47:25] <Eviltwin> Blaster: Try Firebug Lite for IE
[19:48:18] <Blaster> Ok, so systemfault was right, the error handler was triggered in IE 7, the success handler in IE 8 and Firefox (and hopefully everything else)
[19:48:28] <Blaster> But why would the error handler be triggered?
[19:48:30] <systemfault> That's it.
[19:48:32] <masterbee> joshsmith: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/187537/is-there-a-case-insensitive-jquery-contains-selector this will help you.
[19:48:43] <joshsmith> haha yeah, saw that masterbee
[19:48:46] <joshsmith> got it working :D
[19:48:48] <joshsmith> thanks
[19:49:30] <systemfault> Blaster: Then what is the error?
[19:50:10] <Blaster> how do you extract the error?  Something like error: function(data) { console.log(data) } ?
[19:50:19] <systemfault> TIAS?
[19:51:05] <Eviltwin> ?$.ajax @ Blaster
[19:51:07] <bot-t> Blaster, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[19:51:11] <Eviltwin> It's documented there
[19:51:23] <masterbee> Blaster: remember if you are working in IE7 , console.log does not work, it actually throws warnings. just an fyi, in case yu were not aware.
[19:52:05] <systemfault> I usually use IE8 in IE7 mode to develop..
[19:52:11] <systemfault> At least, it has dev tools
[19:52:17] <Blaster> yes I am using IE 8 compatibility mode
[19:52:23] <Eviltwin> I usually don't develop for IE
[19:52:26] <Eviltwin> IE is the afterthought
[19:52:27] <systemfault> (Then when I'm done, I verify in real IE7)
[19:52:43] <Blaster> can you get real IE 7 on Win 7?
[19:52:50] <systemfault> Nope.
[19:53:26] <Blaster> I see
[19:53:37] <Blaster> Well there shouldnt be a huge difference between IE 8 compat and real IE 7 is there?
[19:53:47] <systemfault> It's not huge...
[19:53:48] <Eviltwin> "shouldn't"
[19:54:00] <systemfault> But there is some small differences.
[19:54:01] <Eviltwin> Just like Microsoft shouldn't violate standards
[19:54:40] <Blaster> If only, Eviltwin
[19:55:02] <systemfault> IE10 is going to be nice :P
[19:55:28] <Eviltwin> IE10 will be better than IE9 probably
[19:55:32] <Eviltwin> That doesn't mean it will be nice
[19:55:57] <Blaster> If it wasn't for the crappiness of IE no one would have learned how not to make a crappy browser
[19:56:18] <masterbee> Blaster: been my experience that IE7 compat mode from IE8 is not a good JS equal. CSS parser is ok and a good representation, but the JS engine is still IE8 so it was always a headache for me
[19:57:07] <masterbee> IE10 is finally up to spec in 2.1, but someone should tell M$ that we are all in CSS3 now a days :P
[19:57:15] <Blaster> i need to figure out why the error handler of my ajax query is being triggered in IE 8 compat and not IE 8 regular
[19:57:48] <systemfault> masterbee: Have you checked IE10's featureset?
[19:57:54] <masterbee> Blaster: do you have a jsfiddle sample?
[19:58:03] <systemfault> masterbee: Seems you didn't.
[19:58:27] <Blaster> masterbee:  Unfortunately it's too complex to implement a jsfiddle for it
[19:58:41] <masterbee> systemfault: yes, and they are making some strides for CSS3 but FF and Safari are ahead of the curve last I checked. Am I mistaken?
[19:58:57] <Blaster> could one of the json values having javascript escapes cause the error handler to be thrown in IE 8 compat?
[19:59:14] <Eviltwin> You realize that the point of a jsFiddle isn't to put your whole website in it, right?
[19:59:30] <systemfault> masterbee: From what I've seen, it's going to have pretty much the same featureset as any current browser :/
[20:00:01] <masterbee> Balster: IE tends to be very picky about code syntax, have you tried to JSlint your code?
[20:00:08] <Blaster> Eviltwin:  Yes I realize that.  Let me try extracting the error message from the error handler first to see if it gives an obvious clue/
[20:00:17] * tome wonders if his buffer wrapped around
[20:00:21] <masterbee> systemfault: thank God :)
[20:00:27] <Eviltwin> tome: In JavaScript?
[20:00:44] <systemfault> masterbee: We'll still be stuck with IE7/8/9 for a while though...
[20:00:46] <systemfault> damnit.
[20:00:47] <tome> nope, just we're talking about putting too much code in jsfiddle and also suggesting jslint : )
[20:01:13] <masterbee> tome: lol
[20:01:25] <tome> @dyj
[20:01:41] <tome> or whatever was blasted at me when I put way too much code in jsfiddle
[20:01:43] <Blaster> So this is my error output from this code... error(data,status,error) { console.log(error) }
[20:01:43] <tome> : D
[20:01:47] <Blaster> LOG: [object Error]
[20:01:56] <Eviltwin> Oh, it's an error
[20:01:57] <masterbee> systemfault: facepalm... I hear you.
[20:02:01] <Eviltwin> There's your problem
[20:02:21] <Blaster> But it doesn't tell why it's triggering the error handler
[20:02:30] <systemfault> Blaster: error.message perhaps?
[20:02:30] <Blaster> It triggers the success handler in IE 8
[20:02:36] <Eviltwin> It's IE, it doesn't need a reason
[20:02:59] <masterbee> Eviltwin: lol, nice touch!
[20:03:18] <Blaster> LOG: Invalid JSON: ﻿{"status":"success","message":"\u8b1d\u8b1d\u60a8\u53c3\u52a0\u62bd\u734e\uff01"}
[20:03:27] <systemfault> Blaster: Heh..
[20:03:29] <Blaster> Unfortunately I'm working with Chinese so I have to pass a Chinese error message back to the user
[20:03:48] <Eviltwin> Blaster: Is your JSON end point public?
[20:03:55] <Eviltwin> i.e. could I look at it directly
[20:04:01] <Eviltwin> See if there are any errors
[20:04:24] <Blaster> its on my local dev machine unfortunately..
[20:04:26] <tome> can't you look at the code that's returned first?
[20:04:42] <tome> what's the error code itself?
[20:04:42] <Blaster> error.code ?
[20:04:51] <Whirl3d> anybody got a good reference for understanding the difference between attr and prop? I've read the API, thank you, and could still use some help.
[20:04:51] <Eviltwin> tome: This is a 200
[20:04:51] <Eviltwin> statusCode
[20:05:06] <tome> Eviltwin: but it's going into the error handler on the ajax??
[20:05:06] <systemfault> Whirl3d: .attr is for something you would write in the HTML tag of an element
[20:05:17] <tome> Eviltwin: that can't be right, right?
[20:05:18] <Eviltwin> Because $.ajax has been told to expect JSON
[20:05:19] <systemfault> Whirl3d: .prop is for a DOM property of some element.
[20:05:22] <tome> ahhh
[20:05:30] <Eviltwin> And is failing to parse the string as JSON
[20:05:33] <tome> yes yes
[20:05:49] <Blaster> \u8b1d\u8b1d\u60a8\u53c3\u52a0\u62bd\u734e\uff01 should be fine to pass back right?
[20:05:50] * tome runs away
[20:06:11] <Blaster> the status is "parsererror"
[20:06:20] <Eviltwin> Yes, because there's a parser error
[20:06:38] <Blaster> this is exactly what the ajax output looks like ...
[20:06:39] <Eviltwin> I would start by adding json2.js to your page and see if the issue persists
[20:06:48] <Blaster> ﻿{"status":"success","message":"\u8b1d\u8b1d\u60a8\u53c3\u52a0\u62bd\u734e\uff01"}
[20:06:56] <Blaster> But I think it's in UTF-8 if that makes a difference
[20:07:05] <Whirl3d> systemfault, thanks for the explanation. I don't know why I am having a hard time with it...you make it sound so simple.
[20:07:05] <Eviltwin> All it takes is one unprintable character or unacceptable piece of whitespace in there for everything to explode
[20:07:13] <systemfault> Whirl3d: :D
[20:07:18] <Eviltwin> Hence why I was asking if I could target the endpoint directly
[20:07:54] <tome> json2 ++
[20:08:49] <masterbee> Blaster: IE7 is bad a parsing JSON period, as other are mentioning. Slightest inconsistency and it throws a parser error. I lost alot of time with JSON requests that contained french accented characters in IE7.
[20:09:10] <systemfault> It's worse than that...
[20:09:19] <systemfault> IE7 doesn't have a JSON parser.
[20:09:20] <Blaster> These are chinese characters, but they appear as \u8b1d\u8b1d\u60a8\u53c3\u52a0\u62bd\u734e\uff01 for some reason
[20:09:49] <Blaster> Could the page encoding being UTF-8 have any effect?
[20:10:42] <masterbee> Yeah, I used a JSON parser plugin and my problems ended.
[20:10:47] <masterbee> http://furrybrains.com/media/2009/01/jquery.json.js
[20:14:59] <joshsmith> how can I remove an item from the DOM and reappend it elsewhere
[20:15:15] <systemfault> You just...
[20:15:28] <systemfault> .remove it and .append it elsewhere?
[20:15:59] <joshsmith> when doing .remove does that get the html, or do I just chain it?
[20:16:18] <systemfault> HTML?
[20:16:19] <joshsmith> I didn't think I could chain it, since .remove would just make it disappear
[20:16:34] <systemfault> Read the documentation :/
[20:17:02] <systemfault> Once the initial HTML is parsed, there's no more HTML.. only DOM nodes.
[20:17:10] <masterbee> joshsmith: .remove takes it out of the DOM, if you store it in a variable , then you can .append it so another node in the DOM.
[20:17:37] <tome> "There is no spoon"
[20:17:45] <joshsmith> if I do var elem = $('#some-id').remove(), will that store it appropriately?
[20:18:01] <masterbee> yes joshsmith
[20:18:05] <systemfault> joshsmith: You might want .detach instead.. depends if you have events bound.
[20:18:19] <masterbee> good point systemfault
[20:18:29] <joshsmith> I have events bound to some sub-elements within that element
[20:18:42] <systemfault> joshsmith: Then .detach might be more appropriate.
[20:19:11] <joshsmith> hm
[20:19:14] * joshsmith has never used that
[20:19:28] <systemfault> http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[20:19:32] <joshsmith> oh! this is cool
[20:19:34] <joshsmith> yeah, reading docs now
[20:19:35] <masterbee> I always forget about .detach ever since I learned to user .on()
[20:19:46] <masterbee> to use*
[20:20:15] <systemfault> .on ftw.
[20:20:21] <Blaster> So if I use a json parser it's going to fix my issues?
[20:20:44] <Blaster> apparently some BOM at the beginning of my json is causing the error handler to be triggered in my ajax call in IE 7
[20:20:45] <systemfault> Blaster: It might... I never had to play with chinese+json :/
[20:20:57] <systemfault> Ah
[20:21:08] <ch3mical> Chinese JSON?
[20:21:08] <masterbee> Blaster: Ah
[20:21:38] <Blaster> I'm having trouble figuring out how to get rid of the BOM
[20:21:55] <Blaster> this is what it looks like: http://pastebin.com/VXBZKwiM
[20:22:01] <masterbee> Blaster: do you have control of the file with the BOM?
[20:22:34] <masterbee> if not that could be a problem, since usually the fix it to take an editor like notepad++ and save UTF-8 without BOM
[20:23:07] <joshsmith> when I do append, is there any syntactical sugar to get the new appended element as the returned object, rather than the element I appended to?
[20:23:37] <tome> your handle to it is still good
[20:23:58] <Blaster> masterbee:  I did convert the file in Notepad++, but I'm not sure what to do because it's a large framework and I think every file needs to be converted
[20:24:08] <tome> $v1 = $(); $v2.append($v1); $v1 <-- still good
[20:24:28] <joshsmith> ah cool
[20:24:46] <Blaster> uh oh I think changing the encoding of one of the files just triggered quirks mode in IE 7
[20:28:05] <masterbee> Blaster: BOM is nasty, I has a similar problem and had to create a script to automate the conversion of my servers files ( over a 1000 ) to true UTF-8 without the BOM. It is for the best unfortunately. UTF-8 with BOM will cause other issues ( extra "Whitespace" in CSS rendering in Safari, and Chrome, etc )
[20:28:14] <masterbee> *I had
[20:28:28] <joshsmith> sweet thanks for the help masterbee, tome
[20:28:36] <joshsmith> I got a completely circular list working
[20:28:56] <masterbee> np joshsmith
[20:28:59] <tome> nice!
[20:29:23] <joshsmith> you guys can check it out if you sign up for my app (using LinkedIn) ;)
[20:30:02] <joshsmith> it's just a tiny LinkedIn invites widget
[20:31:24] <masterbee> systemfault, tome what are your thoughts about JS at the bottom of the page? I am building a jQuery based framework for one of my clients and was thinking of getting away from the head to improve page responsiveness. Thoughts?
[20:31:46] <tome> masterbee: I've been using require.js, so probably not the best person to ask : )
[20:32:15] <tome> but I use it mostly because it's convenient and fits my style
[20:32:25] <masterbee> thanks tome, require.js is nice.
[20:32:34] <masterbee> systemfault? thoughts?
[20:33:48] <masterbee> Blaster: how are you holding up? did the BOM issue coupled with the parseJSON() fix it for you?
[20:34:03] <Blaster> unfortunately still struggling...
[20:34:13] <Blaster> do I need to include a JS library for parseJSON ?
[20:36:04] <masterbee> give me a sec Blaster, I will look for what I did. It was a while ago.
[20:36:52] <Blaster> masterbee:  Wouldn't it trigger the error handler before even getting to the point where I can manipulate the JSON data?
[20:37:24] <systemfault> masterbee: I personally always add every scripts but modernizr at the end of the page just before the </body> because it feels faster for the user
[20:37:49] <masterbee> Blaster: maybe not. http://tbs-sct.ircan-rican.gc.ca/projects/gcwwwgeo/repository/entry/branches/v1.0/js/plugins/wet-boew.geotarget.js
[20:38:08] <masterbee> look at the first part of the file. It is a jquery-json parser function
[20:39:14] <Blaster> that looks scary
[20:39:17] <Blaster> lol
[20:39:18] <VarunBatra> Hi, from scale of 0 to 10 how bad these codes are? http://dev.language-learning.net/js/common.js I am not looking for suggestions but your marks like if it an exam. 0 being way too poor, 10 means way too good
[20:39:54] <masterbee> thanks systemfault. I hear you and that was what I was used to before, yet I am building a complete framework with all the trimings so all the plugins are minified and in one file. Responsiveness was starting to be a concern.
[20:40:13] <tome> VarunBatra: at least it's not using eval: "//wHeight = eval(wHeight) "
[20:40:23] <systemfault> VarunBatra: 2/10
[20:40:41] <VarunBatra> Sounds perfect thanks, its always great judgement from you :)
[20:41:04] <Blaster> ugh... I need a break.  How would that json parser make it so the success handler gets triggered rather than the error handler in IE 7 on my ajax query?
[20:42:28] <masterbee> VarunBatra: I second systemfault's score, at least there were some comments :) sorry hope I did not offend.
[20:43:58] <masterbee> Blaster: the error you are getting is a parser error, the request was successful, but the parsing was not. That is why IE7 threw the error. If we elimate ( by adding a parser ) at what IE7 is complaining about this may fix the issue. Makes sense?
[20:44:43] <Blaster> yes it does but I have to go for an hour and a half.  I'm going to attack the issue when I get back hopefully, maybe you'll still be here.
[20:45:19] <VarunBatra> Blaster, I believe to be said 'you are shit' when I am shit so that I can improve, anyways it isn't my code :)
[20:46:28] <VarunBatra> I was studying sites, I love doing that.
[20:46:41] <masterbee> ah :P
[20:47:18] <VarunBatra> My own site is different, and I thinking sharing of it isn't good here, I was warned few days back about advertising. Otherwise I can write. I believe I did my best in that site though with respect to jQuery codings.
[20:49:20] <masterbee> yeah, advertising is not good, but sharing when people need guidance and help is another story. Keep up the motivation and eagerness to learn. Improvement is always a journey.
[20:50:13] <VarunBatra> Well what I did, I studied many sites, and implement their stuff in one. :)
[20:50:58] <VarunBatra> Specially changing of path (URL) using jQuery without hash. I thinking HTML5 is new world for 99% of developers
[20:52:07] <masterbee> Yep, HTML5 is a new world full of limitless possiblities. I am just eager for the video elements and video formats to finally come to a cross road and agree :)
[20:52:17] <VarunBatra> Do you think it worth more marks? http://dev.language-learning.net/js/googleMaps.js I wonder which is better 15 Global variables or 1 object containing 15 variables or an array of 15 variables. I would go for object with 15 variables (member)
[20:52:28] <systemfault> masterbee: I'm very pessimist about that :(
[20:52:32] <VarunBatra> I saw a video, guy was breaking video using jQuery
[20:52:59] <VarunBatra> I couldn't look at codes he has used google compiler
[20:53:42] <masterbee> systemfault: I hear you, but I can only dream. Mobile video is the latest craze and with Flash out of the mobile market, things just got interesting.
[20:53:55] <VarunBatra> Looks like people are doing lots of manipulation for optimization, not to hide things. I think more you open your codes, more contribution you gives to world.
[20:54:07] <systemfault> masterbee: It would have been interesting if everybody could just use h264
[20:54:18] <systemfault> masterbee: But it probably won't happen.
[20:54:39] <VarunBatra> systemfault is human/bot?
[20:54:59] <systemfault> VarunBatra: Yes, I am a bot.
[20:55:12] <masterbee> systemfault: agreed, lol nice systemfault
[20:55:15] <VarunBatra> I doubt now
[20:55:41] <VarunBatra> systemfault, from 0 to 10 http://dev.language-learning.net/js/googleMaps.js ? Just an overview not reasons.
[20:56:56] <systemfault> 3/10
[20:57:06] <VarunBatra> lol improvements :)
[20:57:53] <masterbee> systemfault: I am leaning toward .webm since I am an opensource fan, and well it appears that google is trying to make it a viable option as well.
[20:58:04] <VarunBatra> In between, how important is it that we avoid reflows? When my site loads, I have done some animations which cause 15 reflows total
[20:58:05] <chee> masterbee:
[20:58:06] <chee> and also
[20:58:08] <chee> systemfault:
[20:58:23] <chee> if you supply webm + h.264
[20:58:54] <chee> that covers IE (9+), Firefox (4+), Chrome, and Opera
[20:59:32] <chee> and iOS safari, and Android Browser 2.3+, and Opera Mobile
[20:59:35] <VarunBatra> Am I missing, are masterbee and systemfault are among jQuery team?
[20:59:50] <systemfault> VarunBatra: Just a normal web developer.
[21:00:10] <VarunBatra> Well all are normal :)
[21:00:20] <masterbee> chee: agreed, but the multiple formats come with a price for enterprises. I know it is negiable, I think what systemfault and I are getting at is that like the browser wars, the less options and more standardization is what we strive for.
[21:00:24] <chee> i disagree. most are depraved lunatics
[21:00:29] <masterbee> <-- regular developer as well
[21:00:49] <chee> (regards normality, esp. javascript developers)
[21:01:00] <chee> depraved lunatics !
[21:01:06] <VarunBatra> chee I should change my overview after reading your thoughts :)
[21:01:14] <VarunBatra> openion
[21:01:21] <VarunBatra> Pardon spellings
[21:01:25] <chee> masterbee: yes it would be nice to have one format we could use instead of 2
[21:01:34] <systemfault> VarunBatra: Seriously.. stop using eval.. it's awful
[21:01:34] <destryalhmns> can i shoot an off topic idea - still ajax/html5/css3/jquery related
[21:01:42] <VarunBatra> I am not using it.
[21:02:05] <masterbee> destryhms, ask away.
[21:02:14] <systemfault> VarunBatra: The code you pasted abuses of it.
[21:02:16] <VarunBatra> So you want to refresh you marks on based on it? Eval gives you access to compiler so I don't use it.
[21:02:17] <chee> masterbee: but 2 formats covering ~68% of the *current* browser share is pretty much awesome as a possum
[21:02:18] <iateadonut> <a onClick='ajaxAddGTB(id);'>create GTB account</a>  - from within the function ajaxAddGTB(), how do i refer to the text inside of <a></a>?
[21:02:40] <destryalhmns> current technologies extremely easy and clean (to your face)
[21:02:58] <masterbee> chee: agree, that is why jQuery supports multiple browsers all about market share.
[21:02:59] <destryalhmns> so modern developers should make clean and simple, i like good.is
[21:03:02] <VarunBatra> Ok, sorry about it, I was just studing codes.
[21:03:23] <destryalhmns> in terms of connecting with others, like on irc
[21:03:32] <destryalhmns> filters to the extreme
[21:03:43] <chee> masterbee: right now Apple and Microsoft are the only ones not supporting the open webm format
[21:03:54] <chee> masterbee: i'm sure that fills you with shock and awe
[21:03:59] <systemfault> iateadonut: .text() on the element?
[21:04:04] <destryalhmns> ...thats all end idea/
[21:04:11] <systemfault> chee: But both support h264.
[21:04:18] <systemfault> chee: And google supported it in the past.
[21:04:32] <iateadonut> yeah.  how do i refer to that element from within the function?
[21:04:40] <masterbee> iatedonut: "this" should be the object that is passed to so $(this).text() will give you the text.
[21:04:47] <VarunBatra> iateadonut $(this).text();
[21:04:50] <systemfault> iateadonut: $(this).text() I guess... I never use inline handlers..
[21:05:17] <chee> systemfault: yep that's what i was saying. if you supply h.264 and webm together you cover everybody on a modern browser, including opera and opera mobile
[21:05:17] <VarunBatra> I believe I use it many times. I think getting html is better most of time.
[21:05:40] <systemfault> VarunBatra: Sorry?
[21:05:51] <systemfault> chee: But not firefox :/
[21:06:02] <systemfault> chee: Which supports only ogv IIRC
[21:06:10] <systemfault> (theora)
[21:06:13] <chee> systemfault: firefox supports webm
[21:06:16] <destryalhmns> i have more ideas...
[21:06:17] <chee> firefox 4+
[21:06:19] <systemfault> chee: Natively?
[21:06:22] <VarunBatra> It is about usability, my text always inside some class so I use $(this).html(); to avoid reformating or changing formats
[21:06:24] <systemfault> chee: Ah, good then
[21:06:24] <destryalhmns> what about a dating site for gay pets?
[21:06:57] <chee> systemfault: yes! isn't it!
[21:07:16] <systemfault> chee: :P
[21:07:22] <chee> maybe we could just sneak around to everybody's houses and install the webm codec for internet explorer and safari
[21:07:38] <iateadonut> what about pure javascript?
[21:07:45] <systemfault> iateadonut: ?
[21:07:53] <VarunBatra> innerHtml is there
[21:07:59] <VarunBatra> I don't know innerText :)
[21:08:11] <VarunBatra> iateadonut: ^
[21:08:12] <destryalhmns> ff !itext
[21:08:27] <systemfault> IIRC, some browser support innerText... others textContent
[21:08:29] <destryalhmns> because ff is the worst browser
[21:08:38] <systemfault> That's why $().text() exists..
[21:08:42] <destryalhmns> just use innerhtml
[21:08:49] <iateadonut> i don't know - i'm getting a jquery error when i try this: alert( $(this).text() );
[21:08:50] <systemfault> destryalhmns: Nah, the second better imho
[21:08:58] <systemfault> destryalhmns: Just after chrome.
[21:09:13] <VarunBatra> I believe that if site runs great on IE8 then we are good, ain't we?
[21:09:21] <destryalhmns> i just did a fix today where ff sucked because it didnt support innertext
[21:09:32] <VarunBatra> What market share says? People are now more into FF, then IE isn't it?
[21:09:32] <systemfault> VarunBatra: Depends on your contracts.. I usually have to support ie7 :'(
[21:09:45] <destryalhmns> and i spent several hours with firebug where it wouldnt work or step into function appropriately
[21:09:54] <masterbee> systemfault: second that, and IE6 believe it or not! ouch!
[21:09:57] <VarunBatra> systemfault he he :) ie7 is way too old, even in India we don't bother it.
[21:09:57] <destryalhmns> and ff doesnt use a lot of other methods like other browsers
[21:10:02] <systemfault> VarunBatra: As far as market share goes IE > Chrome > FF
[21:10:02] <destryalhmns> guys, ff sucks balls
[21:10:22] <systemfault> destryalhmns: That's a bad argument though..
[21:10:26] <destryalhmns> safari is actually the best in terms of working
[21:10:38] <VarunBatra> I doubt on Chrome but I will do some google on it.
[21:10:38] <destryalhmns> and i dont mean to dumb down this channel
[21:10:46] <destryalhmns> by debating browsers
[21:10:53] <destryalhmns> cause politics got lame
[21:11:08] <systemfault> VarunBatra: Chrome just recently went ahead of firefox..
[21:11:28] <systemfault> IMHO it's well deserved...
[21:11:43] <systemfault> Because IMHO, mozilla has been lazy for too long.
[21:11:53] <systemfault> (Before Firefox 4 was released)
[21:12:05] <lyrae> I have a mind blowing question right now
[21:12:19] <chee> lyrae: ya ya
[21:12:21] <chee> go
[21:12:24] <destryalhmns> do it
[21:12:30] <chee> my mind is ready
[21:12:31] <systemfault> Y U NO ASK?
[21:12:36] <lyrae> It's hard to explain without shwoing the page..which youd have to login to instagram, but IOK SO
[21:12:46] <lyrae> say you go to the page. you see a gallery, thumbnails
[21:12:51] <iateadonut> function ajaxAddGTB(id) {  alert( $(this).text() );  }         <a onClick='ajaxAddGTB(id);'>create GTB account</a>      - when i click on 'create GTB account' , should that function work to alert 'create GTB account
[21:12:54] <iateadonut> ?
[21:12:56] <lyrae> say, 5 thumbnails next to each other
[21:13:00] <lyrae> if you resize the browser
[21:13:09] <lyrae> itll be 4, or 3, thumbs next to each other
[21:13:14] <lyrae> and im looking at the css
[21:13:19] <lyrae> its this, right now #photoResults .m:nth-of-type(3n+1) {
[21:13:20] <destryalhmns> YES
[21:13:21] <iateadonut> because it's throwing an error in jquery.min.js
[21:13:27] <lyrae> 3 images in a row
[21:13:34] <lyrae> if i maximize to full resolution, it changes to
[21:13:37] <lyrae> #photoResults .m:nth-of-type(5n+1) {
[21:14:05] <lyrae> so the space from the browser's left border to the left column of images is always the same
[21:14:11] <destryalhmns> UD \\\\\id is right class right nth right of type is the ?
[21:14:13] <lyrae> same thing for the right...what changes is the space between the images
[21:14:19] <destryalhmns> sry ID
[21:14:28] <lyrae> that did not make sense did it?
[21:14:41] <destryalhmns> you can select by type?
[21:14:42] <masterbee> iateadonut: function ajaxAddGTB(id) { var elem = $(this); alert( elem.text() ) }, try that
[21:14:44] <chee> lyrae: yes it did
[21:14:59] <lyrae> so how do they dynamically decide how many images to put in a single row
[21:15:07] <lyrae> according to browser windows width?
[21:15:43] <lyrae> if anyoen uses instagram, you can see it here: http://ink361.com/#/feed   and just resize the window to see what i mean
[21:15:50] <destryalhmns> put it all in a div and do overflow:no-wrap
[21:15:59] <destryalhmns> see how that works
[21:16:06] <lyrae> ill get scrolls
[21:16:20] <lyrae> ok let me show with screenshots. just two of them
[21:16:28] <destryalhmns> each element gets display inline or inline-block
[21:16:48] <destryalhmns> if neither work something else might be messed up
[21:17:11] <chee> lyrae: @media queries
[21:17:26] <chee> are one way
[21:17:35] <destryalhmns> sry its white-space:nowrap
[21:17:50] <destryalhmns> and try
[21:17:56] <destryalhmns> overflow:hidden
[21:18:12] <destryalhmns> and in extremes !important
[21:18:17] <lyrae> here is what i mean:  http://i.imgur.com/IL5eJ.jpg    http://i.imgur.com/7HCsB.jpg
[21:18:23] <lyrae> guys its not a matter of just overflwo
[21:18:30] <chee> lyrae: i know it's not
[21:18:33] <lyrae> they are detecting the width and changing it in the css and you resize the browser
[21:18:39] <chee> i'm not saying it's a matter of overflow
[21:18:55] <destryalhmns> fuckign firebug
[21:19:00] <lyrae> let me google media queries
[21:19:16] <systemfault> destryalhmns: Before firebug... debugging was shit.
[21:19:38] <destryalhmns> <!--[IE]--> something like that
[21:19:48] <systemfault> destryalhmns: But now, the chrome dev tools are my personal favorites :D
[21:19:53] <VarunBatra> Anyway to read google compilers compiled codes?
[21:19:55] <destryalhmns> and then you can do css for different browsers
[21:19:58] <chee> I'm saying it's either css @media queries or, it could be some nice javascript.
[21:20:16] <destryalhmns> whats the problem with the likn you posted, it looks good
[21:20:19] <chee> lyrae: in jquery there is also, $(window).resize
[21:20:23] <lyrae> alright. but to achieve that effect, what is best to use?
[21:20:32] <lyrae> yeah but i'd have to make the css file a js one?
[21:21:11] <destryalhmns> i believe css and js are linked
[21:21:25] <chee> lyrae: here is what i would be
[21:21:33] <chee> *do
[21:21:38] <lyrae> hit me
[21:21:50] <chee> i would write all the rules
[21:21:59] <chee> #photoResults .m:nth-of-type(3n+1), photoResults .m:nth-of-type(5n+1)
[21:22:01] <chee> etc
[21:22:28] <lyrae> but how does it know
[21:22:38] <lyrae> how many images are in a row before the next row starts?
[21:22:46] <lyrae> so it doesn't add margin to the right most image
[21:22:51] <destryalhmns> slightly back on track - numeric id's from server?
[21:23:43] <chee> mm
[21:23:46] <drdo> Is it possible to get the error code on ajax errors?
[21:23:47] <destryalhmns> you can
[21:23:51] <chee> lyrae: i just lookedat your screenshots
[21:24:03] <destryalhmns> if you want to know how many images in a row you can go hardcore
[21:24:09] <chee> this is my first day using jquery
[21:24:13] <chee> of course
[21:24:18] <destryalhmns> try container.width()
[21:24:27] <masterbee> iatedonut: http://jsfiddle.net/MnV4z/10/
[21:24:38] <masterbee> iateadonut: http://jsfiddle.net/MnV4z/10/
[21:24:39] <destryalhmns> and then image.width() + container and margin and padding
[21:24:42] <destryalhmns> add it all up
[21:24:45] <destryalhmns> ><?
[21:24:50] <destryalhmns> figure it out
[21:24:53] <chee> lyrae: this isbeing done with the javascript and not with the css
[21:25:03] <destryalhmns> cause different screen sizezes and browsers and dont of course me asshole
[21:25:18] <chee> destryalhmns: are you drunk
[21:26:07] <lyrae> uhm
[21:26:38] <chee> lyrae: i mean, the margin is being set dynamically
[21:26:46] <destryalhmns> doesnt matter
[21:26:47] <destryalhmns> im right
[21:29:22] <masterbee> drdo: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxError/ check the the comments below there is a person that had a similar question and we answered already with a code snippet. hope this helps.
[21:31:40] <destryalhmns> if need be you can set them to display:none
[21:31:45] <destryalhmns> as a clone
[21:31:50] <destryalhmns> and get their dimensions
[21:32:26] <destryalhmns> but if you know nothing about them across various browsers on the client side you have to measure
[21:32:29] <iateadonut> masterbee, thanks, what i'm trying to do is find the id of the text that was just clicked.  in other words, i won't know it but will want to identify it by it being clicked.
[21:33:56] <Whirl3d> what does $("strong",this) mean?
[21:34:40] <destryalhmns> in the context of a jquery function something that has both the strong tag and is the kinf of element that called the function
[21:34:45] <masterbee> iatedonut : update the jsfiddle link HTML portion with what your HTML code looks like and what you want to achieve
[21:35:41] <Whirl3d> destryalhmns, thanks. Wow that seems weird to me. How would I read more about that kind of nomenclature/notation?
[21:35:47] <systemfault> Whirl3d: $('selector here', parentNode)
[21:35:58] <systemfault> Whirl3d: Same as: parentNode.find('selector here')
[21:36:03] <destryalhmns> jquery docs
[21:36:14] <destryalhmns> i might be wrong but...
[21:36:26] <destryalhmns> people always love to point out if you are slightly wrong
[21:36:34] <Whirl3d> systemfault, thanks. You have a gift for precision and concision.
[21:36:39] <systemfault> :)
[21:36:57] <masterbee> Whirl3d: the last reccomendation that systemfault is saying is the best approach in terms of best practice.
[21:37:28] <Whirl3d> Cool. Thanks masterbee. That's the one I'm familiar with. pfew
[21:37:28] <Marcus> Hi guys, just wondering if I can ask a noob question on the .one function...
[21:38:05] <Whirl3d> sure. This channel is not like the #css channel, ask away
[21:39:03] <destryalhmns> http://api.jquery.com/one/
[21:39:19] <destryalhmns> looks like you provide a bunch of delegates and one handler
[21:39:31] <Marcus> LOL, thx. I'm changing a line of code so that instead of calling a dot notation function in .one eg: return  this.one(options.edit,options.toEdit)... I want to instead do something before the toEdit function so instead I want to do: return this.one(options.edit,function (e){ alert('here'); option.toEdit; }
[21:40:07] <Marcus> Problem is, the dot notation function toEdit, actually wants the (this) variable for reference, but it passes nothing when I call options.toEdit on the function.
[21:40:23] <Marcus> this object, not variable
[21:40:35] <Whirl3d> sounds like you need to write a closure function
[21:41:10] <Marcus> When .one is called, I take it passes the object, this, and the event handler, correct?
[21:41:22] <destryalhmns> i agree
[21:41:28] <destryalhmns> closure might do it
[21:41:28] <Marcus> closure function?
[21:41:30] <systemfault> Perhaps jQuery.proxy could help
[21:41:35] <destryalhmns> have you tried it and had a problem?
[21:42:09] <Marcus> Yeah, when using .one(options.edit, options.toEdit) the this object and the event handler are passed.
[21:42:10] <destryalhmns> vat x = myFunc(){}; and then pass x
[21:42:15] <destryalhmns> r
[21:42:17] <destryalhmns> VAR
[21:42:50] <Marcus> when using .one(options.edit, function (e) { options.toEdit; } only the this object is passed
[21:43:15] <Marcus> Not the event handler
[21:44:16] <Marcus> detry:??? I'm not clear on what your suggesting, sorry.
[21:44:24] <Marcus> destry:
[21:44:45] <altares> hi everyone
[21:45:41] <altares> A quick question if anyone has an idea regarding query: is possible to preventDefault() on a scroll() event
[21:46:26] <Whirl3d> do you need to pass "edit" for the first parameter?
[21:46:43] <Whirl3d> the first parameter is a string, not a function (I think))
[21:46:47] <Marcus> this.one('click',options.toEdit) is the same
[21:47:12] <Marcus> options.toEdit is a function options.toEdit = function () { $self = $(this);
[21:47:16] <Whirl3d> this.one(funcname, data, function)
[21:47:28] <Whirl3d> this.one("click",,options.toEdit)
[21:47:29] <progrock> anyone god with flexbox model? I
[21:47:53] <destryalhmns> sry back
[21:48:01] <progrock> I'm messing around for the first time, and getin different result sin chrome and FF
[21:48:13] <destryalhmns> was pointing out that chee would have to get my coffee in the real world
[21:48:15] <Marcus> Whirl: this.one('click',,function(e){ options.toEdit; } ? Is that what you mean?
[21:48:49] <Whirl3d> what does options.toEdit refer to
[21:49:01] <destryalhmns> okay so this is a new technique of mine
[21:49:12] <Marcus> Whirl: function options.toEdit = function (e) { $self = $(this); }
[21:49:22] <destryalhmns> but is seems logical and to standard, i may be wrong
[21:49:24] <systemfault> Marcus: options.toEdit.call(this) ?
[21:49:33] <Marcus> system: thx
[21:49:36] <Marcus> BRB
[21:49:36] <destryalhmns> unknown container
[21:49:43] <destryalhmns> is me talking still relevent?
[21:49:58] <Whirl3d> so, try $(this).one("click", function () {options.toEdit.apply($(this));});
[21:50:12] <Whirl3d> oh wait, I always get call and apply mixed up
[21:50:31] <Whirl3d> yes
[21:50:33] <systemfault> Whirl3d: .apply would also work... the difference is about how the arguments are passed.
[21:50:50] <Whirl3d> destryalhmns, I'm listening regardless.
[21:50:52] <Marcus> It worked. I love this CHANNEL!!!
[21:51:01] <Marcus> Thx Sys/Whirl/Destry
[21:51:16] <destryalhmns> if you are forced to do it client side
[21:51:36] <destryalhmns> get the width of the div .width or outerWidth
[21:52:01] <destryalhmns> get the width of the elements in the row .width or outerwidth plus spaces
[21:52:04] <destryalhmns> ad that up
[21:52:10] <destryalhmns> and magic
[21:52:13] <destryalhmns> thats all
[21:52:25] <destryalhmns> probably nothing amazing to yall
[21:53:20] <Whirl3d> to what were you responding, there, destryalhmns?

[22:08:27] <Whirl3d> intinity is not defined?
[22:08:35] <Whirl3d> infinity?
[22:14:13] <Whirl3d> I am trying to write a simple plugin that allows me to use this:   $(sel).max(propName) to get the maximum value of the passeed property out of all items in $(sel)....and $(sel).maxItem(propName) to get the item associated with the max value ......
[22:15:00] <Whirl3d> I'm not really sure what I am doing, but here is my start effort: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/HkxJg/26/
[22:30:08] <Gent> is it possible to add an event listener / handler INSIDE another event listener / handler to be triggered at the end?
[22:46:07] <Whirl3d> why can't I access my variables in this code: http://jsfiddle.net/n2TMM/27/
[22:46:41] <Whirl3d> Gent, what are you asking?
[22:47:14] <Whirl3d> $(this).click(function (e) {$(this).mouseout(function (e){console.log("out");});})
[22:47:33] <Whirl3d> *mouseleave
[22:47:36] <Whirl3d> not mouseout
[22:47:39] <Whirl3d> sry
[22:51:24] <systemfault> Whirl3d: You can access it just fine, no?
[22:56:13] <Whirl3d> Yeah. I thought Math.infinity worked...it doesn't.
[22:56:36] <systemfault> Then use something better...
[22:56:44] <systemfault> Like Number.MIN_VALUE
[22:59:25] <Blaster> hi im back
[22:59:38] <Blaster> still have to fix the jQuery ie7 issue
[22:59:42] <Blaster> sorry Ajax ie 7 :P
[22:59:59] <Blaster> man before I learned any javascript those terms were synonymous
[23:00:31] <Whirl3d> systemfault, http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/HkxJg/45/
[23:01:55] <systemfault> Whirl3d: So it works ?
[23:03:40] <systemfault> (seems to)
[23:04:50] <Whirl3d> Yes, finally. I skipped needing the Number.MIN_VALUE, but I appreciate knowing about it, thx.
[23:05:09] <systemfault> :)
[23:07:33] <Whirl3d> YEAH! My maxItem script is chainable! Not a big accomplishment, I am sure. But it finally works...
[23:07:46] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/HkxJg/48/
[23:08:08] <taipres> has the creator of jquery made any money off it?
[23:10:44] <systemfault> The question is... Would anyone be using jquery if they had to pay for it?
[23:10:51] <systemfault> I believe the answer is no.
[23:11:23] <taipres> systemfault maybe at first, but now? I believe the answer would be absolutely yes
[23:12:06] <systemfault> shrug... People would fork it.
[23:12:09] <taipres> In any case I hope the creator has been compensated for creating something so neat and useful :)
[23:22:23] <Whirl3d> I don't think he has ever been paid directly for it. But I am sure that he has given lectures/seminars for which he is compensated
[23:22:40] <Whirl3d> And written books.
[23:24:52] <Whirl3d> But there should be an  optional licensing model...one where you could opt to pay for access to jquery. Then developers could legitimately pay for it if their budgets allowed and still use it if they didn't
[23:25:26] <Whirl3d> I would gladly upcharge clients and give the money to the jquery team if it were licensable in some way like that.
[23:58:00] <gadlol> Hi, is it possible to disable page scrolling with jquery when mouse cursor is on top of a flash and user scrolls up or down?
[23:59:30] <Whirl3d> you would have to handle the scroll event bound the the flashcontainer and use stopPropagation() or preventDefault()...but I am not sure..
