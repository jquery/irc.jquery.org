[00:01:29] <Cork> chachan: you have a colon after your []:
[00:01:37] <Cork> ah
[00:01:45] <Cork> chachan: you can't create objects like that
[00:03:09] <chachan> Cork, what do you mean?
[00:03:19] <Cork> chachan: http://jsfiddle.net/JqJBY/3/
[00:03:25] <chachan> because, I'm seeing examples and looks like that
[00:03:55] <Cork> same on min
[00:04:06] <faraway> chachan: {key: value}   key must primitive type not a function call
[00:04:07] <Cork> chachan: thats impossible
[00:04:43] <Cork> key can be a string, a number or just a symbol
[00:04:51] <Cork> nothing else
[00:05:48] <Cork> chachan: missed a section http://jsfiddle.net/JqJBY/4/
[00:06:01] <chachan> Cork, I see, so you make a "call" and then with a returned value you can create an object
[00:06:02] <chachan> right?
[00:06:14] <Cork> uh, what?
[00:06:51] <Cork> you create an empty object, then with the brackets syntax you set the key: value combo
[00:07:06] <Cork> thats what you need to do if the keys need to be dynamic
[00:07:15] <chachan> ok
[00:07:20] <chachan> testing...
[00:07:22] <Cork> just check the pb
[00:07:25] <Cork> its fixed there
[00:08:48] <thomas`-> Hi everyone. Is it safe to do add and remove classes with addClass and removeClass multiple times and presume that it will check if it already exists and not add it again if it doesnt?
[00:09:03] <Cork> yes
[00:09:15] <thomas`-> like addClass("myClass").addClass("myClass")
[00:09:33] <thomas`-> i dont want it to be class="myClass myClass" but class="myClass"
[00:09:48] <faraway> thomas`-: as Cork sayed .. it's not a problem
[00:10:06] <thomas`-> thank you Cork
[00:10:14] <thomas`-> faraway, thanks
[00:10:14] <NackNick> can someone help me real quick, im doing a scrollto function and everytime I do the scrollto right after its done i get a "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'effect'" how can i go about fixing this?
[00:10:36] <faraway> NackNick: you $(this)
[00:11:28] <faraway> NackNick: sorry accidentally deleted the rest of the message :D
[00:11:40] <Cork> lol
[00:12:06] <dblosevn> i was thinking i was smokin crack or somethin tryin to read that lmao
[00:12:12] <Cork> NackNick: sounds like something gets an object thats not a jquery object
[00:12:19] <NackNick> hmmm not sure that will work, where would i put it on this... http://pastebin.com/4B8e9y5J
[00:12:46] <dblosevn> Cork: finally got my dev environment back, jsbin and pastebin lol
[00:12:55] <faraway> NackNick: hmm ... then your plugin requires jquery-ui or something like that
[00:13:01] <NackNick> cork well it says its coming from the scrollto script
[00:13:06] <NackNick> =/
[00:13:09] <Cork> no
[00:13:20] <NackNick> ohhh
[00:13:23] <Cork> NackNick: what are you using for the scrollto feature?
[00:13:28] <NackNick> you might be right
[00:13:34] <Cork> the only one i know of is scrollTo (capital T)
[00:13:44] <NackNick> let me see if the jquery ui needs to be included real quick
[00:13:53] <Cork> jqeury ui has no scrollto
[00:14:08] <NackNick> the script came with one tho
[00:14:22] <Cork> ?.scrollTo
[00:14:24] <bot-t1> Cork, .scroll() - Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[00:14:32] <Cork> ?g jquery scrollTo
[00:14:33] <b-ot> Cork, jQuery.ScrollTo → http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[00:14:34] <bot-t1> Cork, jQuery.ScrollTo - http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[00:14:51] <NackNick> yeah im not using that one
[00:14:58] <NackNick> i couldnt get it to work to save my life...
[00:15:11] <Cork> interesting
[00:15:17] <Cork> i'm using it quite a lot
[00:15:25] <dblosevn> works great on the demo site lol
[00:15:34] <NackNick> lol
[00:15:34] <Cork> ya, its lovely
[00:15:39] <dblosevn> i was just playing with it
[00:15:50] <NackNick> yeah i ive heard good things about it but i cant get it to work for anything
[00:15:56] <Cork> especially that you can scroll to a specific element
[00:15:58] <NackNick> ive tried it at different times with no luck
[00:16:35] <beachandbytes> ive used it quite a few times, you should try again Nack
[00:16:49] <dblosevn> did pastebin decide to go closed source? i swear you used to be able to download it, i had to hack a super old version of it together to do what i wanted it too earlier
[00:16:57] <Cork> its by far the best plugin for scrolling elements
[00:17:05] <NackNick> maybe next time, Cork was right about this script needing jquery ui so that seems to have fixed it
[00:17:17] <Cork> dblosevn: nope basebin exists as a server download
[00:18:03] <dblosevn> think i have like 0.1 and i just did a quick dirty subdomain hack to it
[00:18:26] <dblosevn> i like to give my clients each there own subdomain off of it
[00:18:39] <NackNick> btw thanks cork
[00:19:19] <dblosevn> jsbin is a bitch to install now, doesnt work out of the box anymore i had to modify the code to get it rolling
[00:20:44] <dblosevn> i only have one ip on that box or i would have tried out the Node installation and i dont want to run on a different port then apaches
[00:21:03] <dblosevn> i might install mod_proxy and try it out later
[00:24:03] <Cork> dblosevn: you could always run a vm :)
[00:24:21] <dblosevn> its a small vps thats also my pbx
[00:24:30] <dblosevn> well cloud server
[00:24:47] <Cork> ah
[00:24:55] <dblosevn> playing around with freeswich
[00:24:59] <dblosevn> *freeswitch
[00:25:15] <Cork> you could always install nginx and user it as a proxy
[00:25:20] <Cork> that works really well
[00:25:33] <dblosevn> wont mod_proxy for apache do the same thing?
[00:25:55] <Cork> apache is much heavier to run as a front machine
[00:26:26] <dblosevn> i dont know nginx though :-( ive tried and failed to get it to work numerous times in the past
[00:27:10] <dblosevn> just last week on a freeswitch/fusiopbx install actually
[00:27:17] <dblosevn> fusionpbx*
[00:27:33] <hazamonzo> hmm, how might i go about selecting the next dom item? sooo say i have <h1>foo</h1><div>bar</div>... i want to be able to do something like $('h1').whatSelector()?
[00:27:36] <Cork> wow
[00:27:44] <dblosevn> .next
[00:27:58] <Cork> dblosevn: its quite simple, its config file is much more structured and readable then apache
[00:28:00] <dblosevn> hazamonzo
[00:28:10] <dblosevn> but im used to the confusion lol
[00:28:45] <Cork> where i learned to hate apache configs was when i took over an apache site with a rewrite database
[00:28:51] <Cork> that... was hairy
[00:29:04] <dblosevn> ya i dont do the whole rewrite_map thing
[00:29:47] <Cork> and the path proxying is a feature that apache doens't have
[00:29:52] <dblosevn> i played with it a couple times but i decided against that approach
[00:30:27] <dblosevn> thought you could create a script virtual directory as a proxy
[00:30:34] <Cork> http://www.example.com => apache; http://www.example/api => node.js
[00:30:37] <Cork> for example
[00:31:22] <dblosevn> naw i wanted something like http://www.example.com:80 => http://www.example.com:8080
[00:31:30] <Cork> sure that works in both
[00:31:52] <Cork> hack that doesn't even have to be in the server level
[00:32:03] <dblosevn> so i can bind node to another port and just proxy with apache
[00:32:22] <dblosevn> as apache is already listning on 80
[00:32:25] <Cork> ya, but you need to specify what should go to the proxy
[00:34:00] <dblosevn> ProxyPass / http://example.com:8080 connectiontimeout=5 timeout=30
[00:34:05] <dblosevn> in the virtualhost
[00:34:44] <dblosevn> dont think i have mod_proxy installthough so i cant test
[00:44:33] <dblosevn> installing node now, gonna see if its that easy
[00:46:39] <dblosevn> taking forever to compile
[00:52:09] <Lee-Lee> hi guys, I'm trying to update the value of an input field when a keypress event is triggered: http://pastebin.com/5mtxDzTM … line 3, doesn't seem to be working though?
[00:56:30] <Cork> Lee-Lee: you need to wait for the event to end, else the browser will just overwrite your changes
[00:57:05] <Cork> Lee-Lee: alternatively if you're ok with not having complete browser support (by all browsers) you could try the "input" event instead
[00:57:28] <Cork> Lee-Lee: btw $(this).html() != '' won't ever work
[00:57:54] <Cork> inputs never have any child elements
[00:58:18] <Lee-Lee> $(this) is actually just a div.. I'm replacing the input fields so they can be styled properly...
[01:00:16] <Cork> Lee-Lee: does the div have an tabindex attribute?
[01:00:24] <Cork> *have a tabindex
[01:00:30] <Lee-Lee> Cork: nope…
[01:00:39] <Lee-Lee> Cork: necessary?
[01:00:41] <Cork> then you won't ever get any keydown events on it
[01:00:53] <Cork> well an element need to have focus for it to get inputs
[01:01:03] <Cork> and normal divs can't have focus
[01:01:42] <Cork> Lee-Lee: you might want to listen on the entire document instead though
[01:01:53] <Cork> depends on what you're trying to do
[01:02:16] <Lee-Lee> oh ok.. so can form elements only have focus?
[01:03:32] <Alpha64> hey is there some easy jquery tree style control?
[01:03:45] <Cork> Lee-Lee: form elements, a tags, (might be some more but from the top of my head thats it)
[01:04:04] <Cork> Alpha64: there are a few plugins
[01:06:35] <Lee-Lee> Cork: Thanks for the help!
[01:06:42] <Cork> np
[01:10:49] <faraway> Lee-Lee, Cork: with wai-aria and tabindex combination you can give every html element the ability to have focus in modern browsers
[01:11:31] <Cork> faraway: if you read up i already said that :)
[01:14:08] <faraway> Cork: sorry ... need to get a coffee .. was a short night :D
[01:14:14] <Cork> lol
[01:14:59] <faraway> Cork: to much loc and to less sleep are not a good combination :D
[01:16:05] <Veejay> Hi, I was wondering if it's possible to automatically have the maximum number of children elements in a div container without overflow without using javascript
[01:16:41] <Veejay> i.e. the maximum number of children for any width of the parent div
[01:17:10] <Cork> you mean have the children fill the parent element?
[01:17:58] <Cork> Veejay: ^
[01:24:08] <dblosevn> i give up i cant even install jsbin with npm, errors out its using the wrong python and i cant figure out how to make it use the right one
[01:30:28] <faraway> i know that, when an element is removed with .remove() its data and event handlers are cleaned, it is possible to add a custom function to this process. i don't need to know all elements that where removed, just the one that had event handlers or data assigned.
[01:34:24] <faraway> never mind, found a solution
[01:40:37] <Auger> ello
[02:13:26] <aqeel> hi room
[02:13:37] <Auger> hello aqeel

[02:20:25] <miCSu> I'm trying to find out between which lines a draggable table row should be dropped but somewhy $(ui.helper).position().top gives the same position to almost every time
[02:27:52] <aqeel> hi room
[02:28:20] <aqeel> sorry auger please re reply post here...
[02:28:48] <aqeel> i accedentally closed the last session
[02:30:33] <Auger> http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_openallwindow
[02:30:35] <Auger> ?
[02:31:35] <aqeel> http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_openallwindow
[02:32:09] <Auger> yes

[02:36:50] <Auger> have to use a work around
[02:36:57] <Auger> http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=122689#c3
[02:38:01] <colton> hi, I'm trying to add some handlers dynamically to some elements, am I doing this right? It's not working, perhaps somebody can point me to the right directions :) http://jsfiddle.net/q5J4S/
[02:48:37] <grafi> so the array of elements isnt static colton?
[02:51:41] <tipdbmp> I need a selector that matches elemenents with id="something<and_a_number>", ex: id="A1", id="B1234", etc., any ideas? =)
[02:52:47] <tipdbmp> actually only the number changes so the ids have the format something<number>, so it's only an 'A' followed by some number.
[02:53:27] <grafi> ["id|=A"]
[02:53:36] <grafi> |= should look for a prefix
[02:54:52] <tipdbmp> Oh, tnx =)
[02:58:53] <colton> grafi: sorry, was afk.. - what do you mean by static?
[02:59:16] <grafi> well does the content change?
[02:59:47] <colton> no, on load this method gets called once to register these events for the elements contained in the array
[03:00:11] <grafi> are those inputs?
[03:00:27] <colton> every element should have the same behaviour, so i didnt want to c&p the code for every element
[03:00:37] <colton> yes, those are text inputs
[03:01:29] <grafi> ok so you could just bind the event to any input element in the form
[03:01:33] <colton> and i thought, as you can pass on functions, this should do the trick
[03:01:37] <grafi> or on the page
[03:01:54] <tab1293> im trying to make an equivalent ajax call with jquery as this curl statement? this code is not working http://pastebin.com/ya6W3Pef
[03:02:15] <colton> but i only want it for those specified elements, not every input element should behave like that
[03:04:43] <faraway> tab1293: i guess you request is cross domain ?
[03:05:40] <tab1293> faraway: what do you mean by cross domain?
[03:06:19] <faraway> tab1293: the domain the script is running on is not bergerserver.info:8112
[03:06:51] <faraway> tab1293: but e.g. http://bergerserver.info/ or even http://somotherdomain.tld/
[03:06:58] <tab1293> well the services are both on bergerserver.info just running on different ports
[03:07:07] <tab1293> so i dont think that makes it cross domain right?
[03:07:24] <tab1293> faraway ^
[03:07:29] <faraway> tab1293:  different port is cross domain
[03:07:33] <seutje> usually, if u have to add a prototcol and/or domain to the ajax url, it'll be cross-domain
[03:07:43] <seutje> otherwise, you should be able to omit those
[03:07:45] <tab1293> okay then yes im trying to make a cross domain
[03:07:57] <tab1293> request
[03:08:05] <tab1293> but im obviously doing it wrong haha
[03:08:41] <faraway> tab1293: only requests with jsonp work cross domain by default
[03:09:23] <tab1293> faraway: okay, whats the difference between the two? or how should i change the function to use jsonp?
[03:09:24] <seutje> otherwise u'll need crossdomain xml shit
[03:09:34] <grafi> hm is it me or is jsfiddle down :o
[03:10:26] <tipdbmp> grafi, for some strange reason the $('[id|=A]'), is not workign but $('select[id^=A]') is, why is that?
[03:11:07] <Cork> tab1293: jsonp is a javascript with a function that returns the "json" as a javascript object
[03:11:22] <seutje> tipdbmp: that is odd
[03:11:40] <Cork> tab1293: cross domain is done through appending a script tag to the header of the page and then when the script is loaded, calling the function
[03:12:34] <tab1293> Cork: so how can i use jquery to make a cross domain request
[03:13:00] <Cork> tab1293: the server needs to anser the request with a specially crafted javascript
[03:13:03] <Cork> ?jsonp
[03:13:05] <bot-t1> JSONP, Quickly « plaintext - http://niryariv.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/jsonp-quickly/ , What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/ - set the dataType for .ajax() to 'jsonp' if using .getJSON() see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/#jsonp
[03:13:07] <grafi> colton something like this should work http://jsfiddle.net/q5J4S/2/
[03:13:32] <Cork> tab1293: if you check http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/#jsonp
[03:13:43] <grafi> could of course be annoying when the amount of elements gets bigger
[03:13:57] <Cork> tab1293: the server needs to create a function with the name given in $_GET['callback']
[03:14:11] <Cork> (for php, as an example)
[03:14:41] <tab1293> okay let me read up on this
[03:15:54] <Cork> tab1293: you can alternatively use cors, to give access from the separate server
[03:16:03] <Cork> tab1293: but it only works in fairly new browsers
[03:16:37] <tab1293> Cork: if possible im not trying to alter the service im trying to call. Im just trying to figure out a good way to call it from the web

[03:18:22] <Cork> tab1293: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Server-Side_Access_Control is worth reading too
[03:18:24] <tab1293> Cork: im just not sure if deluge is configured to respond to cross domain requests
[03:18:39] <Cork> tab1293: most likely not
[03:18:50] <Cork> very few servers (none?) are by default
[03:19:11] <tab1293> Cork: can't i potentially just use php to call curl?
[03:19:17] <Cork> yes
[03:19:27] <Cork> you can proxy it over your own server
[03:19:54] <Cork> that has its own problems though
[03:20:04] <tab1293> Cork: why proxy it? and what are the drawbacks
[03:20:25] <Cork> latency and the other party dropping off cause of load or something
[03:22:01] <Cordy> can someone tell me how to use slideToggle for only 1 element I also use click function
[03:22:24] <tab1293> okay and are you pretty sure this is definitely a cross domain problem? i feel like i could possibly be using the ajax command wrong
[03:22:26] <colton> grafi: thanks, will take a look, but seems like jfiddle isnt working
[03:22:38] <grafi> yeah had that problem too ^^
[03:22:53] <Cork> tab1293: if you're fetching from another domain then the one your page loads from, then yes it is
[03:23:01] <grafi> hm closed the tab :o
[03:23:04] <grafi> damn
[03:23:14] <Cork> tab1293: i haven't seen the beginning of your question so can't really answer if it is or not
[03:23:53] <tab1293> Cork: ok assuming it is, what other alternatives do i have besides calling curl?
[03:23:54] <tab1293> if any
[03:27:32] <Cordy> how to slideToggle only clicked element?
[03:31:19] <calistor> Hi folks. Is it good advice to load css-files dynamically? What's best practice? Is there a jQuery way to do it?

[03:43:53] <SmokeyD>  Trisox, hmm, but I am calling many ajax calls from a loop. I need to wait for all the ajax calls to complete. Not just one.
[03:44:22] <grafi> you need to create defferreds then use $.when().then
[03:44:37] <SmokeyD> Trisox, i guess I can create a global count value, that is increased by the success function, and create an infinite loop untill the count value has increased to the number of iterations in the loop
[03:45:14] <Trisox> wy would you do so many requests?
[03:45:54] <Trisox> i would prob send it to the server and fix it there
[03:46:41] <SmokeyD> Trisox, because I am calling a jsonrpc get method for an id from an array of id's
[03:46:42] <Trisox> SmokeyD: are the calls cross domain?
[03:46:43] <SmokeyD> see the sample
[03:46:47] <SmokeyD> Trisox, no
[03:48:11] <Trisox> hmm
[03:51:26] <SmokeyD> Trisox, maybe something like this?
[03:51:27] <SmokeyD> http://jsfiddle.net/fnETz/2/
[03:52:07] <ravenzz> I have a scope issue, http://jsbin.com/iniguc/6/edit Why schange() can't access that.$element but I can do this.$element.children() ?
[03:54:17] <Trisox> well i would prop count number of items in array
[03:54:38] <Trisox> and if that is the same as the completed_request
[03:54:43] <Trisox> then do your thing
[03:55:17] <SmokeyD> yeah, count array.length is better indeed. Thanks for the idea
[03:56:27] <Trisox> ;)
[03:56:28] <ravenzz> nvm
[03:56:35] <Trisox> saves some interval crap ;)
[03:56:41] <Trisox> you dont wanna do that
[03:59:32] <SmokeyD> Trisox, ah, you mean this of course: http://jsfiddle.net/fnETz/3/
[04:01:05] <Trisox> yep
[04:01:30] <SmokeyD> Trisox, thanks
[04:01:40] <Trisox> check if the number of calls are the same as the array length ;)
[04:01:53] <Trisox> and i would do it on succes .think
[04:02:09] <Trisox> not complete cause there is big diference ;)
[04:02:53] <Trisox> succes = A function to be called if the request succeeds
[04:03:27] <Trisox> complete = A function to be called when the request finishes
[04:04:05] <Trisox> ah never mind
[04:04:31] <Trisox> you had it right :)
[04:04:39] <Trisox> i always mix them up
[04:12:09] <SmokeyD> Trisox, I also defined an error in my actual code, to catch any errors. So the number of complete calls and success calls should in that case be the same, or the error is triggered.
[04:14:55] <Trisox> SmokeyD: nice !
[04:21:58] <colton> grafi: thanks, this works like a charm :)
[04:22:37] <j_ayen_green> Having problems with using a value from a global var inside an anonymous function that creates a handler http://pastebin.com/mdaMe4cg
[04:28:08] <Cork> j_ayen_green: you haven't posted the bin yet
[04:28:53] <j_ayen_green> Cork: sorry, didn't notice the captcha. it's there now
[04:29:50] <Cork> j_ayen_green: what part is the global variable?
[04:30:19] <j_ayen_green> code. I didn't show it correctly, having condensed the code for the paste, but it is global
[04:30:49] <Cork> j_ayen_green: if possible create a working example on jsfiddle.net
[04:30:51] <Cork> ?p
[04:30:52] <bot-t1> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:31:29] <Cork> j_ayen_green: the code that's related is enough, but the global where you binding the listener and so on is needed
[04:31:42] <Cork> simply replicate the problem
[04:31:59] <Cork> the pb you have isn't enough to tell what you're doing
[04:32:24] <Cork> ex. its not possible to tell what this is in that code
[04:33:22] <Cork> j_ayen_green: hmm [loop on i] ah
[04:33:28] <Cork> i think i know what you're trying to do
[04:33:52] <Cork> j_ayen_green: you're looping with the help of for?
[04:33:54] <j_ayen_green> Cork: basically, when I create the handler, I want the clicked() call in the handler to have a string as an argument
[04:34:13] <Cork> j_ayen_green: code that's not included is prob the cause of the problem
[04:34:23] <j_ayen_green> Ok, I'll repaste
[04:34:23] <Cork> thats why more context is needed
[04:36:32] <Lee-Lee> $('form#test').submit() works, but as soon as I add.. $('form#test').submit(function(){..}) it doesn't? Any ideas?
[04:36:41] <AL13N_work> is there some kind of event that works when an a tag is activated by keyboard? (not clicked) ?
[04:36:55] <AL13N_work> is there something general that works for both keyboard and mouse?
[04:37:01] <Cork> Lee-Lee: i think i've said this before (might not have been to you though)
[04:37:12] <Cork> Lee-Lee: never have a selector to the right of id's
[04:37:13] <AL13N_work> (i mean an <a> tag)
[04:37:30] <Cork> Lee-Lee: its pointless and only makes the selector slower
[04:38:11] <Cork> Lee-Lee: you're doing return false; or event.preventDefault() or similat in the event listener?
[04:38:36] <Cork> AL13N_work: click works for both keyboard and mouse
[04:38:44] <Cork> keypress should work for just keyboard
[04:38:53] <Lee-Lee> Cork: Well I had return false; .. but even I don't put anything in there it still doesn't work
[04:39:02] <nobitanobi_> hi
[04:39:11] <Cork> Lee-Lee: do you get any errors in the console?
[04:39:26] <Lee-Lee> None :(
[04:39:44] <nobitanobi_> If I do something like $('#myelement').is(':checked') and the element #myelement doesn't exist, jQuery always return false, right? I don't need to worry about undefined
[04:40:47] <Cork> Lee-Lee: can you replicate it in jsfiddle?
[04:41:02] <Cork> nobitanobi_: exactly
[04:41:14] <Cork> $('') always return a jquery object
[04:41:24] <Cork> no matter if it matches anything or not
[04:41:28] <nobitanobi_> Cork: perfect. thanks
[04:42:10] <Lee-Lee> Cork: Just updated to 1.82 from 1.72… odd
[04:42:17] <j_ayen_green> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/ccnJe/   Clicking the first link returns 'b' instead of 'a'
[04:42:32] <Lee-Lee> *working after the update
[04:43:43] <Cork> j_ayen_green: code is undefined
[04:44:21] <Cork> ah its meant to be x
[04:44:22] <j_ayen_green> ah, chopped it off by mistake...1 sec
[04:44:57] <j_ayen_green> yes, http://jsfiddle.net/ccnJe/1/
[04:45:06] <ohcibi> j_ayen_green: dont know exactly what youre doing but to store arbitrary data on elements you should prefix the attributes with data- like data-tracking-code. you can then access the value with .data('tracking-code')
[04:45:24] <j_ayen_green> except code is defined outside all the functions, unlike what I have here
[04:45:24] <Gorkyman> is there a way not to send new server reqeust when I change the img src with jquery?
[04:45:41] <__basic6> i want to set a time mask on a text box (http://jsfiddle.net/9dgYN/1/) so i need the library that provides the setMask functionaliyt, i think this is jquery-tools?
[04:46:07] <j_ayen_green> ohcibi: getting the tracking-code value is not an issue...
[04:46:14] <Cork> j_ayen_green: wfm
[04:46:25] <Cork> j_ayen_green: but ya what ohcibi said is correct
[04:46:42] <j_ayen_green> the issue is that the value in 'clicked' when the link is clicked is the most recent value of 'code'... not the value of 'code' when the click handler was created
[04:46:44] <ohcibi> j_ayen_green: anyway, you should use proper html to avoid any errors in the first place...
[04:46:46] <Cork> html5 specified a prefix that you should use for attributes you invent
[04:46:51] <ohcibi> j_ayen_green: over here the first link returns a, the second b
[04:46:54] <morrijr> j_ayen_green: works for me too - latest FF.  What are you using?
[04:46:59] <Cork> to prevent them from colliding with future attrubute names
[04:47:48] <zuloyd> hi
[04:47:52] <zuloyd> I have a problem with ajax
[04:47:53] <j_ayen_green> latest also. could you move the declaration for 'code' outside everything to make it global, which is what I have here, and see if that breaks it?
[04:47:55] <zuloyd> here's my code: http://hastebin.com/hafivuniwe.lua
[04:48:01] <zuloyd> it always gives me an error
[04:48:06] <zuloyd> i.e. the error method is called
[04:48:10] <Cork> j_ayen_green: that would break it yes
[04:48:19] <zuloyd> but when I just access the ajax link like that, it always works
[04:48:28] <zuloyd> so I take it something's wrong with my jquery ajax code?
[04:48:32] <j_ayen_green> Cork: ah, why?
[04:48:47] <Cork> cause the variable is in the scope you declare is
[04:48:47] <__basic6> http://jquerytools.org/download/ says "Oops. Sorry, try again." ...
[04:49:01] <Cork> j_ayen_green: so if you define it globaly there is one instance globally for it
[04:49:07] <Cork> not one for each event listener
[04:49:19] <Cork> *declare it in
[04:49:32] <morrijr> j_ayen_green: it would be assigned twice; the last time to 'b'.  From that point on it would only be 'b'.
[04:49:57] <morrijr> j_ayen_green: so when you 'click' on the link code would always be 'b'.
[04:50:07] <j_ayen_green> Cork: that makes sense, but is there not a way to do it so when the function creates the click handler, it puts a string in the call to 'clicked' rather than a pointer to the variable that waits for the click to happen to be resolved?
[04:51:08] <j_ayen_green> meaning that when it creates the handler for link a, it creates clicked('a') and not clicked(click)
[04:52:03] <Cork> j_ayen_green: sure
[04:52:15] <Cork> just make sure to create a copy of the variable in a scope for that event handler
[04:52:27] <Cork> in your case the each loop creates a scope
[04:52:41] <Cork> just do: var code_cpy = code;
[04:52:51] <Cork> j_ayen_green: to show the effects http://jsfiddle.net/WCMXC/
[04:53:08] <Cork> run it, see the effect; uncomment the var index; run it again and see the difference
[04:53:30] <Lee-Lee> Cork: Sorry it's still not working… http://jsfiddle.net/HERbR/3/
[04:54:46] <j_ayen_green> Cork: got it. Thanks!! ohcibi and morrijr too :)
[04:56:12] <Harsha_> i need help to use datepicker in my blog
[04:56:19] <Harsha_> please help me
[04:56:48] <morrijr> Harsha_: more information required ;)
[04:57:09] <morrijr> Harsha_: what have you tried, how did it not work?
[04:57:24] <Harsha_> i want to add in blogger
[04:57:39] <Harsha_> dont know i how to do this
[04:57:56] <SmokeyD> Harsha_, you should then first find out how to add javascript to blogger
[04:58:19] <Harsha_> like any visitor can read with date
[04:59:40] <Harsha_> can you help me
[05:00:59] <morrijr> Harsha_: sorry, I've never used blogger.  As SmokeyD said; can you add javascript to it?
[05:01:12] <Harsha_> yes
[05:01:31] <Harsha_> i am sending two link, how they use widget
[05:01:42] <Cork> Lee-Lee: what part is it that isn't working?
[05:01:44] <morrijr> Harsha_: have you added jQuery and jQuery UI javascript and the associated CSS?
[05:01:46] <Harsha_> http://support.google.com/blogger/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=47270#archives
[05:01:56] <Harsha_> http://support.google.com/blogger/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=47270#archives
[05:02:04] <Lee-Lee> Cork: clicking on "send" doesn't submit the form..
[05:02:32] <Harsha_> blogger use Blog Archive , to visit datewise post
[05:02:34] <Lee-Lee> Cork: the JS.. it's near the bottom, labelled it: "this doesn't work"
[05:02:51] <SmokeyD> Harsha_, there is two parts to your question. One is about how to add javascript to blogger, including the necessary javascript jquery and jquery-ui files. If you know how to do that, then you should find out how to write the javscript you need.
[05:03:22] <Cork> Lee-Lee:  $(this).closest('form').submit(function(){ alert('sent'); }); you're sure that's what you want?
[05:03:26] <SmokeyD> Harsha_, the first part is blogger specific. I don't know about blogger, so can't help there. The second part is jquery specific. We can help you with that
[05:03:40] <Cork> Lee-Lee: that will bind an even't listener, not submit the form
[05:04:00] <Harsha_> i dont have much knowledge on jquery, there is a option to add java code in blogger to customize the templet
[05:04:20] <Lee-Lee> Cork: won't it select the form "closest" to the button selected?
[05:04:27] <Harsha_> ok,
[05:04:28] <SmokeyD> so if you try to write some code on jsfiddle.com and try it out, and then you run into trouble, we can help you. Whether you can include javascript in blogger, and also include jquery in blogger, I we don't know. Ask the blogger people
[05:04:40] <Cork> Lee-Lee: yes, and bind an event listener on it
[05:04:44] <Harsha_> tell me how to add value in datepicker
[05:04:46] <morrijr> Lee-Lee: yes, but it doesn't submit it - it listens for a submit action
[05:04:58] <Cork> Lee-Lee: .submit() submits, .submit(function() {}) binds
[05:05:05] <Harsha_> hope i will do rest
[05:05:11] <Lee-Lee> Cork: it works if I take out the funtion(){alert('sent');} …
[05:05:15] <Cork> yes
[05:05:35] <Cork> Lee-Lee: .submit(function() {}) is a short hand for .bind('submit', function() {})
[05:05:50] <Cork> Lee-Lee: .submit() is a shorthand for dom.submit() (kinda)
[05:06:07] <SmokeyD> Harsha_, see http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker and then take jsfiddle.com and try out what is documented.
[05:06:10] <morrijr> Lee-Lee: I find it clearer to use the .on notation - that way it's clear that it's listening for an event.  if I see .submit(function...) I know it's 'wrong' :)
[05:06:27] <Harsha_> ok
[05:06:38] <Harsha_> thanks, SmokeyD
[05:06:39] <SmokeyD> Harsha_, we are not going to write your code for you, you first need to try some yourself, and then if you run into trouble we can help you
[05:06:50] <SmokeyD> Harsha_, no problem.
[05:07:15] <tipdbmp> I have a select in a var: var my_select = $('#my_select'); how can I access it's "array" of <options>?
[05:07:22] <Lee-Lee> Cork: hmm, ok starting to make sense :)
[05:07:41] <Cork> ?.find @ tipdbmp
[05:07:41] <SmokeyD> Harsha_, the first hit on a google search for "blogger include jquery" turned up this result. http://www.way2blogging.org/2012/05/how-to-add-jquery-nivo-slider-to-blogger-blog.html
[05:07:43] <bot-t1> tipdbmp, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[05:07:45] <morrijr> tipdbmp: my_select.find('option')
[05:07:59] <tipdbmp> Ah, I c.
[05:08:00] <SmokeyD> Harsha_, it is not about datepicker, but it does talk about including jquery in blogger.
[05:08:26] <Harsha_> ok, thanks
[05:08:39] <SmokeyD> Harsha_, and the second hit (maybe more usefull) http://www.helperblogger.com/2012/07/how-to-add-jquery-tooltip-to-blogger.html
[05:10:32] <Harsha_> SmokeyD, right second one is helpful
[05:10:35] <Harsha_> thanks
[05:12:44] <Acrack> hello is it possible to generate a pdf with jquery using a .xml file ?
[05:15:36] <Cork> Acrack: no
[05:15:57] <Acrack> Cork and with normal javascript ?
[05:16:11] <Cork> Acrack: not natively no
[05:16:15] <Lost123> Can i put two google translation boxes on my webpage? i mean the google translator plugin code
[05:16:17] <Cork> there might be a lib for it
[05:21:06] <Cork> Acrack: ex. https://github.com/Marak/pdf.js/
[05:22:58] <csehl> what happens if i load a .jpg file into a div? <div id="foo"></div>  $('$foo').load("images/bar.jpg");
[05:23:14] <Cork> csehl: it'll fails
[05:23:26] <Cork> or you will get garbage in your div
[05:23:43] <csehl> Cork: okay, thanks
[05:24:08] <Cork> csehl: <div id="foo"></div>  $('#foo').append('<img src="images/bar.jpg">');
[05:24:15] <Cork> that will load the image
[05:24:29] <Cork> (or .html if you want to replace the content)
[05:24:37] <csehl> Cork: but if there is already one loaded, i need to get rid of it
[05:24:52] <Acrack> Thanks Cork gonna read that
[05:25:05] <Cork> csehl: .html('<img src="images/bar.jpg">') will do that
[05:25:13] <csehl> Cork: thanks a lot
[05:25:24] <Cork> Acrack: the reason its not supported by default is cause browser doesn't understand pdf, and its not xml based
[05:25:44] <Acrack> but i think you can parse xml with javascript
[05:25:52] <Cork> sure, but pdf isn't xml
[05:25:54] <Acrack> and send data to your pdf lib
[05:26:03] <csehl> Cork: i asume if the user hasnt seen the bar.jpg ever yet, it will load it?
[05:26:06] <Acrack> yea i need first to read xml with JS
[05:26:07] <Cork> js can't talk with local libs on the computer
[05:26:36] <Cork> csehl: yes, just like if you add an <img> tag in the normal html
[05:26:44] <Cork> (thats basically what you
[05:26:49] <Cork> *'re doing
[05:26:55] <seutje> )
[05:26:56] <seutje> :P
[05:27:34] <Acrack> Cork i don't get it :D, what i would like to do is :
[05:27:34] <Acrack> Parse xml file with JS to get datas
[05:27:34] <Acrack> Send datas to the JS file that is generating the pdf
[05:27:38] <csehl> Cork: thanks again
[05:27:41] <Acrack> is that possible ?
[05:28:01] <Acrack> (or do all in one JS file)
[05:28:11] <Acrack> with sending anything
[05:28:12] <Cork> Acrack: yes, if you have a javascript lib that know how to create pdf files
[05:28:25] <Acrack> ok =)
[05:28:31] <Cork> Acrack: but you need to provide the support, cause browsers doesn't understand pdf
[05:28:44] <Cork> neither parse or generate
[05:28:52] <Cork> (or show)
[05:29:28] <Acrack> if people have adobe reader
[05:29:31] <Acrack> its ok no ?
[05:38:31] <Cork> Acrack: no the browser can't talk with adobe reader
[05:38:38] <Cork> it just sends the url to it, that's it
[05:38:41] <jsdflk> hi
[05:39:16] <Cork> Acrack: when adobe reader renders inside firefox, firefox just provides an area for adobe reader to render
[05:39:25] <Cork> Acrack: firefox know nothing about what happens in there
[05:39:42] <Cork> opps -firefox +the browser ;P
[05:39:59] <Cork> should prob keep talking on one subject at a time XD
[05:40:40] <Altreus> OK so - Is there a way of identifying the return value of $.get in such a way that I can test inside the success callback whether the callback running is associated with a specific AJAX request?
[05:41:10] <Altreus> reason is if more than one is running at once, I want to skip some of the success() behaviour of all but the latest
[05:41:31] <Altreus> Hence I was going to replace some currentRequest var, and test it inside the callback
[05:41:40] <jsdflk> i´d like to send an email message after a submit button with jquery. the issue is, that there are two people the sender and who request the page request, that the sender has accepted the terms of use and receives an welcome message. can anyone help. it is a asp.net 3.5 page with vb.net
[05:42:22] <jsdflk> i´m using ajax update panels to
[05:42:24] <Lost123> http://pastie.org/5171628 i get a unterminated string literal error in line 3, can't get why
[05:42:50] <Altreus> I wonder whether they'll be the same acutal object
[05:43:28] <Cork> Altreus: no, each call is there own
[05:44:33] <Altreus> I mean I wonder whether the one the callback receives will == the one .get returns
[05:44:59] <jsdflk> any ideas
[05:45:03] <jsdflk> ??
[05:46:06] <Cork> Altreus: what .get returns is the jqxhr object
[05:46:21] <Cork> Altreus: its an object that is uniq for that ajax call yes
[05:46:28] <Altreus> damnit that wasn't even the right logic so it's moot anyway :(
[05:46:33] <Altreus> thanks though - still good to know
[05:47:33] <Cork> Lost123: you're sending this in a .js file or in a <script> tag?
[05:48:11] <jsdflk> i´d like to send an email message after a submit button with jquery. the issue is, that there are two people the sender and who request the page request, that the sender has accepted the terms of use and receives an welcome message. can anyone help. it is a asp.net 3.5 page with vb.net
[05:48:14] <Lost123> script tag
[05:48:17] <Lost123> Cork:
[05:48:53] <Cork> Lost123: the its the </script> part in the string
[05:48:58] <Cork> that will end the script tag
[05:49:00] <csehl> jsdflk: jquery?? asp.net??? VB.NET ?? how many technologies do you need to send asimple email message. i need 3 lines of PHP and 5 HTML tags for that, thats it
[05:49:37] <Cork> Lost123: the html parser goes over the code before the js engine gets it, if it finds a </script> tag, it sees that as the end of the section
[05:50:00] <Cork> Lost123: and thats why you shouldn't add js like that
[05:50:16] <Lost123> Cork: http://pastie.org/5171628 this is complete code, </script> tag is there
[05:51:07] <Lost123> Cork: so what should can be done to write a function of jquery in an element after certain event?
[05:51:32] <Cork> Lost123: http://jsfiddle.net/bq28z/ this is what the parser sees
[05:51:42] <slick-> hey if i have a div that contains an ing src like so: <div class="column_two"> <img src="?img=43"> </div>, how do i modify whats inside the img=src
[05:51:54] <slick-> and how do i remove the image from the div
[05:52:18] <Lost123> Cork:  right, but how can this be done?
[05:52:31] <Cork> give me a sec to rewrite it
[05:52:42] <slick-> $("#test img:last-child").remove() ?
[05:53:14] <Lost123> Cork:  ok
[05:54:08] <clawfire> Hi everybody
[05:54:41] <clawfire> I got a little problem with a jquery widget I try to make, I post an example here http://jsfiddle.net/clawfire/TSJdB/ , anybody can help me to find where the problem is ?
[05:55:39] <tra> hi
[05:56:21] <tra> i'm doing something like this $(selector).find('.something').addClass('x');
[05:56:44] <tra> how can i "rewind" so i can make another find() =
[05:56:45] <tra> =
[05:56:46] <tra> ?
[05:57:01] <Cork> Lost123: http://jsfiddle.net/bq28z/1/
[05:57:06] <Cork> that should work
[05:57:38] <Cork> except for the redundant \ along side the ' quotes
[05:58:18] <slick-> hey if i have a div that contains an ing src like so: <div class="column_two"> <img src="?img=43"> </div>, how do i modify whats inside the img=src
[05:58:26] <Lost123> Cork:  but i need the whole function in it function googleTranslateElementInit()
[05:58:42] <Lost123> this function should also be added to html of the element
[05:59:13] <Cork> ?.end @ tra
[05:59:30] <Cork> Lost123: sure, just define it in you're head
[05:59:44] * Cork pokes bot-t1: 
[05:59:53] <Cork> tra: http://api.jquery.com/end/
[06:00:03] <clawfire> slick-: you don't use jquery for doing this ....
[06:00:11] <Cork> Lost123: jquery won't add it to the body anyway
[06:00:13] <tra> Cork: thanks. total black out :)
[06:00:20] * tra needs more sleep
[06:00:25] <Cork> Lost123: and its better to just statically add it in the head
[06:00:36] <slick-> how do i remove the ing tag completely from <div class="column_two"> <img src="?img=43"> </div>
[06:00:38] <slick-> using jquery?
[06:00:41] <slick-> is thatr a better question?
[06:00:48] <Lost123> Cork: the problem is i need to add a google translator box when the pop up closes, because there can be one instance of the box on page at one time
[06:01:03] <clawfire> slick-: yep pure javascript which is 4x faster
[06:01:13] <slick-> how do i do it?
[06:01:42] <Cork> Lost123: not really all the code it adds is generic
[06:02:00] <Cork> Lost123: you can mod it so it takes a language if prefer that
[06:02:22] <Cork> ah, wait no i see what happens
[06:02:37] <Cork> Lost123: //translate.google.com/translate_a/element.js?cb=googleTranslateElementInit calls googleTranslateElementInit ?
[06:03:00] <clawfire> slick-: element.removeChild() ?
[06:03:36] <Cork> Lost123: http://jsfiddle.net/bq28z/2/
[06:04:01] <Cork> (hmm sorry getScript should be after .html not before
[06:04:24] <Cork> uh clawfire can't modify the src??
[06:04:49] <Cork> slick-: is $('.column_two img').attr('src', 'new-url') what you want?
[06:05:03] <slick-> i just wanna remov the image from  being there
[06:05:26] <Cork> so you don't want to change the src url?
[06:06:30] <clawfire> Cork: why ? yep you can clone it  ? isn't it ?
[06:06:51] <slick-> Cork: actually i wanna do that too
[06:06:54] <slick-> thank you that helped me a great deal
[06:07:00] <slick-> now i just need to remove the image all together
[06:07:02] <clawfire> Cork: nevermind, so he talk he wanna remove the img, not just change the src
[06:07:07] <slick-> Cork: i love you
[06:07:31] <Cork> slick-: is $('.column_two img').remove()
[06:07:36] <slick-> <3
[06:07:36] <clawfire> for removing the entire img, remove the img tag
[06:08:08] <clawfire> Cork: making just a dom modification with jquery take 4x more times that making a .removeChild() in pure javascript ;)
[06:08:20] <crooksey_> Hi guys, im looking for dev todo some front end coding for table drop and drag (between tables and move rows up and down) to also design the html tables, anyone whos intersted pm me :)
[06:08:35] <VictorCL> how can  I from the firebug conslle , use jquery selectors , when I have loaded prototype aswell ?
[06:08:43] <VictorCL> >>> $(".detailedViewTextBox");
[06:08:43] <VictorCL> undefined
[06:08:52] <clawfire> jQuery() not $()
[06:09:23] <VictorCL> ok I see now :D
[06:09:26] <clawfire> or just set jQuery in no-conflict mode (google it)
[06:09:58] <clawfire> so ? nobody for my problem of multiple instanciation here http://jsfiddle.net/clawfire/TSJdB/ ?
[06:19:29] <slick-> thx Cork u made my morning
[06:20:12] <str8uplinux> could someone try and point me in the right direction? - i have a .change( function(){ }); set up. I  need to pass a parameter to that function when calling val().change() such as the following: http://jsfiddle.net/FAcgR/4/
[06:21:03] <Lost123> Cork: you there?
[06:22:40] <VictorCL> why would I get this : TypeError: $(document).ready is not a function
[06:23:36] <str8uplinux> VictorCL: do you have the jquery lib loaded?
[06:23:43] <VictorCL> yes
[06:23:59] <str8uplinux> do you have an example of your code?
[06:26:33] <clawfire> re
[06:27:39] <Cork> Lost123: yes, i'm at home now :)
[06:28:09] <VictorCL> I think I have a conflict with other libraries
[06:29:11] <Lost123> Cork: can you please look at the live page and suggest something?
[06:29:30] <Cork> Lost123: could give it a shot an see
[06:30:08] <str8uplinux> VictorCL: i think i have seen that happen before. you could try unloading some of them to see which one is the culprit
[06:30:50] <Cork> Lost123: try $.jquery
[06:31:11] <Lost123> $.jquery for wat?
[06:31:21] <Cork> ops sorry wrong nick
[06:31:22] <Lost123> i mean $ works fine
[06:31:28] <Cork> VictorCL: that was for you :)
[06:31:29] <Lost123> alright :)
[06:31:39] <VictorCL> ok thanks will check
[06:31:39] <str8uplinux> could someone help me understand how to pass data with .change() like so: http://jsfiddle.net/FAcgR/4/
[06:32:28] <Cork> str8uplinux: you can't
[06:33:26] <Cork> str8uplinux: the first parameter for the event handler is always an event object
[06:33:44] <str8uplinux> Cork, i was affraid of that
[06:33:55] <Cork> str8uplinux: and if you pass data to your change call it will end up in its data member if i remember correctly
[06:36:35] <str8uplinux> Cork: any suggestions on how to tell if the .change() was actually called due to the user physically changing the select list OR by clicking the link?
[06:38:01] <str8uplinux> Cork: what i wanted to do in my .change(function() is have some logic to do something slightly different if the link was clicked instead of physically selected from the select list
[06:38:05] <slick-> If I have something like <div class="form_field" required_message="lol">, how do I get query to find the form_field with the required message that says lol, and then add a style element to it to make it like: <div style="" class="form_field" required_message="lol">
[06:38:46] <Cork> str8uplinux: http://jsfiddle.net/FAcgR/5/
[06:39:04] <timing> $('div[require_message=lol]').attr('style', 'color:red');
[06:39:16] <timing> slick-: but you might want to take a look to css()
[06:40:47] <str8uplinux> Cork: nice! i appreciate it!
[06:41:27] <slick-> thx timing
[06:41:55] <Cork> Lost123: what happend to that live link?
[06:45:40] <Lost123> Cork:  did you get a chance to look at the page
[06:46:07] <Cork> Lost123: on, haven't seen the link
[06:48:06] <Trisox> hey Cork
[06:48:14] <Trisox> hows life
[06:48:33] <Cork> it's weekend so everything dandy :)
[06:48:53] <Trisox> ah nice i need 1 more hour
[06:49:16] <Trisox> was home late yesterday went to the james bond movie
[06:49:27] <Trisox> realy need some sleep :D
[06:49:39] * Cork hits Trisox with a pillow
[06:49:47] <Trisox> Cork: thnx
[06:49:48] <Trisox> :D
[06:49:55] <Cork> :)
[06:50:18] <Trisox> men i realy love jquery validate
[06:50:27] <Trisox> so flexable
[06:50:37] <Cork> never seen any need for it
[06:50:53] <Trisox> hmm we do like validation on every form..
[06:51:03] <Cork> sure same here
[06:51:07] <Trisox> dates numbers etc..
[06:51:14] <Trisox> how do you do validation?
[06:51:30] <Cork> write a function that does it based on class
[06:51:45] <Trisox> ah same thing here with the validation script
[06:51:47] <Cork> class="date required"
[06:51:49] <Cork> and so on
[06:52:15] <Trisox> yes
[06:52:21] <Cork> writing a function that does validation on submit is so damn simple that i've never seen a need for a plugin
[06:54:12] <Trisox> Cork: i use http://jsfiddle.net/xpcf2/ moslty
[06:54:57] * Cork nods
[06:55:21] <Trisox> its verry diverent from the examples shown on the site
[06:56:24] <Cork> if i would use a plugin for form validation it would be to use html5 form validation
[06:56:49] <Cork> (as a fallback for old browsers / not supported features)
[06:57:04] <Trisox> well i still need to support ie8 ...
[06:57:10] <Cork> ya :)
[06:57:24] <Cork> that's there the fallback comes in ;)
[06:57:30] <Trisox> firefox 7  chrome 12 safari ie8 and 9 and ipad
[06:57:41] <Cork> ff7??
[06:57:48] <Trisox> firefox 7 and up
[06:57:49] <Trisox> yes
[06:57:55] <Trisox> that was like last year..
[06:58:11] <Cork> i would understand ff10esr, but not really ff7
[06:58:21] <Trisox> i didnt make it up :p
[06:58:42] <Cork> ff7 doesn't even get any security updates for the last 8 something months
[06:58:45] <fusion27> any of you guys got a MS SQL Server client you like for
[06:58:49] <fusion27> OSX?
[06:59:25] <Cork> Trisox: you know that they have a long support version right?
[07:00:00] <Trisox> fusion27: i like navicat :)
[07:00:19] <Trisox> Cork:  customers dont care for that they install something and go with it
[07:00:39] <Cork> Trisox: ya, but the browser will update by default
[07:00:49] <Trisox> i'm glad that i dont have tu support 3.6
[07:01:06] <Cork> well rather that then ie6 >_>
[07:01:07] <Trisox> not that that would make a diverence with modernzer
[07:01:11] <Trisox> true
[07:01:24] <Trisox> to much animations for ie8 and below
[07:01:24] <Cork> ff3.6 renders well its just a bit slow
[07:01:26] <Trisox> wouldnt run
[07:01:58] <Cork> i normally just strip it down for ie browsers
[07:02:09] <Cork> cause they rairly manage to keep up
[07:02:21] <Cork> (even ie9 have problems)
[07:02:26] <Trisox> i know stubren client...
[07:02:34] <Trisox> i didnt do the design....
[07:02:49] <Trisox> got the code from some 3 party
[07:03:01] <Trisox> and have to go on from there... still cleaning up the mess
[07:03:11] <Cork> you got the actual code?
[07:03:21] <Trisox> yes course
[07:03:25] <Cork> that's rare
[07:03:38] <Cork> normally its just a psd file or even a .jpg :/
[07:03:49] <Trisox> well psd is just fine!
[07:04:13] <Trisox> i do design and html css js
[07:05:01] <Cork> i've managed to get the designed that does it for me to generate .eps files
[07:05:11] <Cork> i thought that was a big step forward :)
[07:05:37] <Cork> don't i would ever want html though :)
[07:06:04] <Cork> would prob cry blod from tables all over the place ;P
[07:06:05] <Trisox> oh i turn it form psd to html css js
[07:06:40] <Cork> Trisox: what part of the "code" do they provide then??
[07:06:42] <Trisox> i'm glad i dont have to do webshops right now... booring stuff
[07:06:54] <Cork> true
[07:07:00] <Trisox> well they did a bad job so i we toke over
[07:07:27] <Cork> i'm the best at js at my job, so sadly i get stuck with it more then i would like >_>
[07:07:33] <Trisox> 5 pages i had to review it.. took them 3/4 moonds to build propperly
[07:07:47] <Cork> heh
[07:08:49] <Cork> one of my bosses still think webdesign should work like it did back in the mid 90's
[07:08:54] <Trisox> they ussed backbone and stufff
[07:08:56] <Cork> the html he produces is scary
[07:09:02] <Trisox> :D
[07:09:18] <slick-> if i have something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/3BJ2j/ how do I make the twitter div move down
[07:09:19] <Saaether> does he use lots of ugly flashy gifs all over the page as well?
[07:09:23] <Cork> <table><tr><td><center><font name=""... T_T
[07:09:31] <Trisox> noooo
[07:09:32] <Trisox> omg!
[07:09:43] <Trisox> center... font ..... name .... ieeeee
[07:09:45] <slick-> i wanna add style="margin-top" to <div validation_message="Validation Message Not Set for input type" required_message="Please enter a Twitter Handle" class="form_field" input_type="text" required="false">
[07:09:49] <Cork> not to forget not closing li elements
[07:10:13] <Cork> Saaether: luckely no not gifs
[07:10:13] <Trisox> devs here do <div class="someting"/>
[07:10:17] <Saaether> lol
[07:10:29] <Cork> heh, xhtml era huh
[07:10:33] <Trisox> well new browsers support that...
[07:10:37] <Cork> no
[07:10:39] <Trisox> ie doenst...
[07:10:56] <Trisox> breaks totaly
[07:11:04] <Trisox> closing tags is hard for them :D
[07:11:09] <Cork> new browsers support that if your sending it as content type application/xml+xhtml
[07:11:22] <Cork> if you don't its invalid
[07:11:46] <Trisox> i build it so with interaction... they only have to do the i18n code if statements and stuff
[07:11:58] <Saaether> i use VS so it generates all my closing tags for me lol, never have to worry about it
[07:12:01] <Trisox> as long as they dont remove anything it will not break :D
[07:12:14] <Trisox> well Saaether i use Zencoding
[07:12:14] <Trisox> >D
[07:12:43] <Cork> slick-: you should be careful with those attributes
[07:12:47] <Trisox> table>tr*4>td*2>label + input.validation
[07:12:56] <Trisox> :D
[07:12:57] <Cork> slick-: some of them have a meaning in newer browsers
[07:13:28] <Cork> slick-: so unless you want the browser to act on them prefix them
[07:13:31] <Cork> data-
[07:14:01] <Cork> Trisox: have you seen the servers that uses yaml to generate html?
[07:14:23] <Trisox> i'm my own html generator :D
[07:14:28] <slick-> how do i target this <div required_message="lol" class="form_field" input_type="text" required="false"> and add a style tag
[07:14:29] <slick-> to it
[07:14:33] <slick-> can someone pls tell me
[07:15:17] <Trisox> i did 15 pages the other day  15 form in them and 5 fancybox popups and 3 $.fn scripts pfff
[07:15:25] <Cork> slick-: did you see my response?
[07:15:34] <slick-> didn't work :(
[07:15:39] <slick-> $('div[require_message="Please enter a Twitter Handle"]').append('style', 'color:red');
[07:15:43] <slick-> should that work?
[07:15:59] <Trisox> no
[07:16:31] <Trisox> wy not use data-rol="" ?
[07:16:37] <Cork> slick-: you should slow down a big and make sure you write a structure that won't break in the next few months
[07:16:45] <Trisox> data-require_message="Please enter a Twitter Handle"
[07:16:46] <Cork> *a bit
[07:17:06] <slick-> the data is thrown out by a 20k line engine which ic an tmodify
[07:17:08] <slick-> i can only modify the html
[07:17:32] <Trisox> that is html :p
[07:17:43] <Trisox> data-rol="" <--html5
[07:17:44] <Cork> i guess you mean you can only touch it through js
[07:17:48] <slick-> yes
[07:17:50] <slick-> that is what i mean
[07:17:51] <Trisox> ahh
[07:17:56] <Saaether> also for applying css you should use .css() or addClass()
[07:17:58] <Saaether> not append
[07:18:02] <slick-> i don't have the work hours available to modify a 20 thousand like engine
[07:18:04] <Cork> man, why do i keep hearing that structure...
[07:18:09] <Cork> it's sad
[07:18:36] <slick-> so how do i fix this
[07:18:36] <slick-> $('div[require_message="Please enter a Twitter Handle"]').append('style', 'color:red');
[07:18:40] <Trisox> Saaether: he might wanna remove other styling ;)
[07:18:41] <Cork> slick-: $('div[require_message="Please enter a Twitter Handle"]')..css({color:'red']);
[07:18:56] <Trisox> . dot to much cork D
[07:18:58] <Cork> uh, minus the extra dot
[07:18:59] <Trisox> :D
[07:19:09] <Cork> ya, i saw that
[07:19:19] <Trisox> k
[07:20:26] <Cork> and yes unprefixed attributes is a big problem, i've helped several developers where the site stopped working from a browser update
[07:20:42] <Cork> and the reason was that the standard implemented a new feature
[07:21:16] <Trisox> Cork: you could use .attr to find it...
[07:21:28] <Cork> find what?
[07:21:29] <Trisox> not use the css prefix
[07:21:36] <Trisox> require_message
[07:21:44] <Cork> no you can't find with attr
[07:22:09] <Trisox> your sure
[07:22:14] <Cork> and div[required_message] works fine
[07:22:20] <Cork> Trisox: yes
[07:22:25] <Cork> you would use filter though
[07:22:32] <slick-> <3 thx
[07:22:37] <Trisox> right
[07:23:16] <Cork> would==could
[07:23:33] <Trisox> i got that ;)
[07:24:31] <Trisox> if i was keen on english...  i wouldnt be able to read most of the questions in this irc channel... :P
[07:24:31] <slick-> should this be css({color:'red'}); Cork
[07:24:47] <Cork> lol
[07:24:49] <Cork> yes
[07:24:55] <Trisox> slick-: no no need
[07:25:05] <Cork> Trisox: i did a typo
[07:25:05] <seutje> I often get headaches in here as well
[07:25:09] <slick-> np
[07:25:17] <Trisox> hey seutje
[07:25:18] <slick-> $('div[require_message="Please enter a Twitter Handle"]').css({color:'red'}); errors out on me
[07:25:18] <slick-> hmmm
[07:25:32] <Cork> Trisox: i wrote .css({color:'red]) <-- notice the bracket
[07:25:39] <seutje> hey
[07:25:53] <Cork> slick-: whats the error?
[07:26:16] <Trisox> .css('color','red');
[07:26:22] <Trisox> would work just fine
[07:26:32] <slick-> actually no error
[07:26:35] <Cork> same with the css command that's up there
[07:26:36] <slick-> but i don't think it did anything
[07:26:40] <slick-> hmm I'm gonna try display none
[07:26:49] <Cork> slick-: prob the selector not matching
[07:26:57] <slick-> yea :(
[07:27:07] <Trisox> .css({'color':'red', 'background':'green'});
[07:27:19] <Trisox> if you wanned to pass more css propertys
[07:27:25] <Cork> the string after the required_message have to match exactly (case sensitive)
[07:27:26] <Trisox> slick-: use .css('color','red');
[07:27:39] <Cork> Trisox: doesn't matter, to leave it
[07:27:54] <slick-> I did make it case sensitive
[07:27:54] <slick-> hmmm
[07:28:13] <Trisox> you cant make it case sensitive
[07:28:17] <Cork> one sec let me fiddle it
[07:28:26] <Cork> Trisox: what?
[07:28:37] <Trisox> data-Rol is bad.. data-rol="fine"
[07:28:42] <Trisox> you cant use casing
[07:28:44] <Cork> ...
[07:28:48] <Cork> read again
[07:28:57] <slick-> hey Cork its on fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/3BJ2j/
[07:29:01] <slick-> would be great help bro
[07:29:01] <Trisox> oh hehe
[07:29:07] <slick-> thanks again for the help so far

[07:39:49] <Clorith> Hmm, I'm doign a .ajax() call in a script, works fine in chrome but in IE I get an "Invalid argument" error, not quite sure what it could be related to. Put my jQuery up at http://jsfiddle.net/9Z5P5/ and the output of the "data" variable at the time of submitting is there as well
[07:40:55] <slick-> omg i love you
[07:40:58] <slick-> i fucking love you
[07:41:16] <slick-> let me have your babies
[07:41:18] <slick-> clicking now to see
[07:41:30] <Saaether> in your selector you had a typo, you had require_message instead of required_message
[07:41:34] <asfds> hi
[07:41:39] <Saaether> so it wasnt matching
[07:41:40] <slick-> ohhhhh
[07:41:42] <slick-> jesus i love you
[07:42:38] <asfds> i´d like to send an email message via jquery from asp.net site. i only find code for php but not for vb.net. any ideas
[07:44:09] <dblosevn> asfds: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8755758/asp-net-send-mail-in-vb-net
[07:44:46] <dblosevn> asfds: youd do the same thing to trigger the asp script with jquery as you would a php script
[07:46:30] <asfds> dblosevn: how do you mean that
[07:47:21] <dblosevn> asfds: jquery is incapable of sending an email, youd do an ajax post to the server (or standard post) and trigger the email to be sent from aspnet vb
[07:47:24] <Saaether> write a method to send the mail in vb and then call it via ajax in jquery
[07:47:55] <dblosevn> ^
[07:48:34] <asfds> Saaether: ok have you a codesample
[07:48:55] <Saaether> dblosevn already linked a code sample for sending email in vb
[07:48:56] <asfds> i have the method in vb, how can i call it
[07:49:11] <hlve> visual basic?
[07:49:21] <asfds> ok but how can i call it via jquerry
[07:49:25] <Saaether> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[07:49:37] <asfds> hlve: yes, vb.net
[07:50:28] <dblosevn> i forgot most of whatt i know about aspnetvb and this really isnt the channel to ask about vb.net post controllers
[07:53:04] <dblosevn> although

[08:01:52] <ciack404> Hi everyone
[08:02:00] <slick-> i love you all
[08:02:09] <dblosevn> :-D
[08:02:47] <ciack404> is there any jquery mobile way to have a "read more" feature? I tried jquery condense but it doesn't work
[08:07:09] <dblosevn> ciack404: could wrap the "more" content in a div and add a class readmore, and bind a click listner to the read more button that would slidedown the hidden text not seeing anything built in to do that
[08:07:35] <dblosevn> ciack404: and .readmore: display:none;
[08:08:46] <ciack404> dblosevn thanks for the reply. But since my text is generated dinamically have you any idea on how can I "truncate" it?
[08:09:14] <dblosevn> ciack404: what language are you using server side?
[08:09:26] <ciack404> python
[08:09:43] <dblosevn> ciack404: not a python guy sorry :-( on my list
[08:10:13] <ciack404> dblosevn ok thank you very much anyway :)
[08:11:08] <dblosevn> ciack404: in php I would make a copy of the textvar truncate on word boundrys to x chars then replace the truncated text from the orignalvar
[08:11:40] <dblosevn> then i would have one var with the truncated text and another with the readmore
[08:13:44] <ciack404> dblosevn I should not touch the server side because it's used for more then one front end. I think I'll try to truncate the text client side
[08:14:09] <antihero> I'm trying to use jquery and apply and not having much luck
[08:14:14] <antihero> is there a better way to do this? http://bpaste.net/show/BP5Ecj4841iYHcVfEGcx/
[08:14:23] <dblosevn> ciack404: whas the response look like? is it json?
[08:16:22] <dblosevn> antihero: really lol your using attributes on an element to determine selectors and methods... bad juju
[08:16:59] <ciack404> dblosevn it's a string containing html tags
[08:17:25] <dblosevn> antihero: hopefully you dont defnie an anonomous function within the function attrib
[08:18:15] <dblosevn> ciack404: hmm, ya youll have to do that on the frontend or pass in another var from this app to change the output format eg readmore=true
[08:18:50] <asker> hiho my slideToggle() doesnt work and i dont know why
[08:19:05] <asker> it just makes a normal toggle without the slide effect
[08:19:07] <dblosevn> far easier to do it serverside then on the client especially considering the work your assigning to the mobile device
[08:19:19] <dblosevn> ?demo @asker
[08:19:19] <bot-t> asker, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:19:36] <asker> $('#titleinfo_'+$(this).attr('data-title_id')).slideToggle();
[08:20:08] <ciack404> dblosevn yeah I know, that's probably why condense plugin doesn't work on mobile
[08:20:10] <asker> so the selected element just toggles without slideffect
[08:20:53] <dblosevn> asker: you may have css conflicting with it hard to tell without seeing the code
[08:21:07] <antihero> How do I get the content type from the jQuery XHR object?
[08:21:30] <dblosevn> getHeaders is in one of the objects @ antihero
[08:21:43] <dblosevn> cant rememebr which one
[08:22:42] <asker> i dont get it, how it could be a conflict which toggles without effect. the toggle toggles the right element
[08:24:24] <dblosevn> antihero: jqXHR.getResponseHeader('Content-type');
[08:24:57] <dblosevn> antihero: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[08:25:21] <dblosevn> *Content-Type
[08:26:24] <BillCriswell> When you guys are building plugins do you start with an example usages of it then work on the plugin itself?
[08:27:01] <BillCriswell> I find it extremely difficult to built it before I try an example of using it for some reason.
[08:34:35] <jrajav> BillCriswell: Yup, it's called test driven development ;)
[08:34:41] * hlve slaps BillCriswell around a bit with a large trout
[08:34:49] <fusion27> For the Git users in here, how do you handle it when you're working on one thing, don't quite finish it, start working on another thing, commit, commit, commit, get it done and realize you should've branched like 8 commits ago?
[08:35:41] <jrajav> fusion27: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1394797/move-existing-uncommited-work-to-a-new-branch-in-git
[08:35:44] <ajpiano> fusion27: this is what #git is for, but in short, branching, cherry-picking, and interactive rebasing (git rebase -i) are your friend
[08:36:08] <fusion27> the guys in the git room are dicks
[08:36:15] <fusion27> thanks guys
[08:37:09] <seutje> you could also soft reset to the branching point, branch and commit then, no?
[08:38:56] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[08:39:07] <BillCriswell> jrajav: I hope that's a good thing!
[08:39:13] <jrajav> It's a very good thing
[08:39:24] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[08:39:32] <grafi> because it says test  in the name
[08:39:38] <RawProduce> so async ajax calls are supposed to be non-blocking, right?
[08:39:41] <grafi> tests are veeeeery important
[08:39:44] <jrajav> Some argue that it's a waste of time, but there's certainly no harm, and I think it's very useful
[08:39:48] <Gho5t> anyone know why in a click event e.clientY is undefined in ios?
[08:40:00] <jrajav> BillCriswell: Google it
[08:40:11] <RawProduce> I've got a set of chained ajax calls which result in the browser locking up - this happens with both chrome and firefox
[08:40:33] <RawProduce> this is what the code looks like - https://gist.github.com/4002095
[08:40:59] <BillCriswell> jrajav: I google lots of things and after I read what something is I realize I've already been doing it but just have no idea what it's called.
[08:41:44] <jrajav> I run into that all the time with functional programming concepts
[08:42:14] <jrajav> They freaking masturbate to those mathematical concept and names
[08:42:15] <BillCriswell> jrajav: Yeah, it's brutal during interviews haha.
[08:43:03] <jrajav> BillCriswell: Oh god yes, I had a screening interview where two of the 5 questions were literally: "What is MVC?" "What is OSI?"
[08:43:52] <BillCriswell> Haha
[08:43:58] <BillCriswell> "Isn't that some kind of... thing?"
[08:44:04] <BillCriswell> yeah, way to go Bill.
[08:44:31] <RawProduce> knowing acronym definitions is more important than coding is the message I get from those questions
[08:46:05] <BillCriswell> RawProduce: Yeah. LIke I don't already have 100s in my head.
[08:46:54] <BillCriswell> I was asked about OOCSS the other day, was totally lost... thought it was like a variant of SASS or something.
[08:47:35] <RawProduce> object orientated CSS exists? interesting
[08:47:55] <RawProduce> I always thought that CSS was targeted at designers, this seem a bit overkill
[08:48:01] <BillCriswell> RawProduce: It's just a way of writing CSS.
[08:48:14] <jrajav> Object orientate all the things
[08:48:16] <RawProduce> sure, but the person needs to grok OOP to use it
[08:48:37] <RawProduce> most designers I've met are more along the lines of "copy, paste, done"
[08:48:57] <jrajav> CSS developer !== designer
[08:49:11] <RawProduce> point
[08:49:13] <BillCriswell> RawProduce: Yeah, web design is definitely getting more difficult for the hack types like that.
[08:49:57] <BillCriswell> I have no idea where the line is drawn between a developer and a designer and I'm probably one of those things haha.
[08:50:26] <systemfault> BillCriswell: The focus?
[08:50:53] <systemfault> I can design just fine, it takes me 10 times as much time as a real designer.
[08:51:19] <systemfault> s/as/than
[08:51:56] <BillCriswell> systemfault: I'm in the same boat. I also like to think I think about usability and accessibility more than a lot of them ( well, quite a few i've dealt with ).
[08:52:17] <systemfault> Heh :/
[08:52:30] <BillCriswell> Like.. "Damn, that looks good there... but it's not helpful to anyone."
[08:52:36] <BillCriswell> Back to the drawing board.
[08:56:01] <grafi> back to the batcave.
[09:01:46] <fission6> how do i remove all <options> that have a value?
[09:01:58] <fission6> or all but the first option, either selector would work
[09:03:20] <fission6> $("#category-selector option").slice(1).remove(); works
[09:03:49] <Cork> that was close to what i was going to suggest :)
[09:04:02] <Cork> (really close)
[09:04:29] <Cork> $("#category-selector option[value]") is another option
[09:04:38] <fission6> nice
[09:05:21] <garciawebdev> hey
[09:05:28] <garciawebdev> I have preventDefault() an event on my callback, but I want that event when a deferred is resolved, is that possible?
[09:05:36] <garciawebdev> here is the gist: https://gist.github.com/4002292
[09:06:36] <Cork> garann: event should exist in that scope
[09:06:55] <Cork> you can't set preventDefault there if that what you're planing
[09:07:32] <csmrfx> How to fire a function *after* $(document).ready( function() {} ) finishes
[09:07:40] <csmrfx> +?
[09:07:44] <grafi> oO
[09:08:05] <grafi> why after?
[09:08:12] <Cork> csehl_: setTimeout(function() {}, 0)
[09:08:23] <csmrfx> because it inserts a script tag which has function that takes some time to load
[09:08:35] <Cork> oh
[09:08:49] <Cork> csehl_: bind an event listener on the script tag
[09:09:00] <sssilver> Hello everyone. Animating opacity and left at the same time doesn't work in IE8: opacity isn't animated. Snippet: http://bpaste.net/show/A0oEXBk0E9yzphH8ICHt/ -- what gives?
[09:09:04] <sssilver> am I doing something wrong?
[09:09:58] <csmrfx> Hm, never bound an event to a script tag
[09:09:58] <Cork> csmrfx: var s = $('<script>'); s.on('load', function() { alert("it's loaded"); }); s.attr('src', 'url');
[09:10:30] <csmrfx> right
[09:10:41] <csmrfx> let me try that
[09:15:11] <csmrfx> ok, seems dynamically injected script tags are not visible to jquery
[09:16:36] <daveace> so to just jumpin and aks
[09:16:37] <daveace> ask*
[09:16:40] <daveace> sorry*
[09:16:49] <daveace> jump in*
[09:16:51] <daveace> ill start agai
[09:16:57] * daveace sighs
[09:17:12] <csmrfx> Think before typing. Enter is not a punctuation mark.
[09:17:25] <daveace> right, jquery $(document).load  isnt working in ie9?
[09:18:01] <daveace> im sure it's something really simple that ie9 needs
[09:18:19] <daveace> it works in ie8, firefox etc. but i cant even get it to alert
[09:18:30] <daveace> yeah csmrfx, i just noticed my errors one after the other
[09:20:09] <Tommo> Hey all, I've spend most of the day playing around with Ben Alman's jQuery BBQ - which is a pretty awesome tool!  However I can't see a way of getting hashbang working with it.  Iv'e tried downloading the source and manually adding #! instead of # in various places, but it's only partially worked :(
[09:21:38] <Tommo> Does anyone have any ideas on BBQ with hashbang?  Or is there another library that will do the job?
[09:22:14] <daveace> cheers anyway lads
[09:26:50] <csmrfx> daveace go to stackoverflow
[09:27:02] <csmrfx> ask a google q + "stackoverflow"
[09:34:26] <zfly9> Hey guys I have this site... http://zhlaw.six5webdesign.com/ and sometimes the jQuery slider doesn't show
[09:34:46] <zfly9> clicking the home icon will make it work, but I can't figure out why it wont work randomly
[09:39:25] <BillCriswell> zfly9: That's weird... What I usually do is validate the HTML. Also, maybe try taking out the $(function(){ }); since it's in the footer.
[09:42:29] <zfly9> BillCriswell, its pretty valid, the errors are irrelevant
[09:42:34] <zfly9> I'll try the function thing
[09:43:02] <BillCriswell> zfly9: I've had errors the seem irrelevant bite me in the ass before. Just a precaution I take I guess.
[09:43:32] <grafi> hm, how do you get the slider to fail? just reload the page and see if it still works? any special browser, or something?
[09:44:02] <BillCriswell> grafi: It fails for me in Chrome.
[09:44:18] <grafi> chrome can be a bitch :P
[09:44:47] <zfly9> BillCriswell damn I thought the function thing worked but it failed after a few refreshes
[09:44:57] <grafi> funny not seeing images at all ^^
[09:46:27] <BillCriswell> zfly9: How about the images that are 404ing? right.png, waitt.gif and left.png ?
[09:46:57] <BillCriswell> The code is working when the images don't display, it's just showing black.
[09:46:59] <grafi> hm now it works in chrome? ^^
[09:48:30] <zfly9> BillCriswell, I don't want to use those images anyway
[09:53:16] <firstclassfunc> has anyone tried to hide 'secret' code (stuff they dont want others seeing) inside jquery, then obfuscate it?
[09:53:30] <BillCriswell> zfly9: Try putting the width and height on the images in the slideshow.
[09:53:58] <BillCriswell> I see a width and height of 0 being set on the slides when it's not working., which seems a little off to me.
[09:54:26] <shahraship> hey, I'm trying to load up a remote html page. It loads fine on FF and Chrome, but not in IE. Here is the example: http://jsfiddle.net/jDtt4/ Can anyone suggest what should I do differently?
[09:54:53] <MistuhKurtz> ?SOP @ shahraship
[09:54:54] <bot-t> shahraship, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[09:55:07] <MistuhKurtz> it seems like FF and Chrome are becoming more lax with SOP
[09:55:15] <tbws> Is there a way to make .load() fail on a 404?
[09:55:31] <MistuhKurtz> tbws, you can check the status code
[09:55:52] <BillCriswell> zfly9: It might be like a caching thing.
[09:56:35] <shahraship> MistuhKurtz: so there is no way to do this?
[09:56:39] <tbws> MistuhKurtz: It still loads the content into the element i.e. $('element').load(); irrelevant as to what the status code is.
[09:56:59] <MistuhKurtz> tbws, then use ajax() and load it manually
[09:57:23] <MistuhKurtz> shahraship, you need a server-side script to 'proxy' the page
[09:57:53] <shahraship> hmm, or I can encode the html in json and load it that way?
[09:58:30] <MistuhKurtz> JS makes a request to a local server-side script -> sever-side script grabs the data from the remote page -> data is returned to your JS front-end
[09:58:48] <MistuhKurtz> you have to do the same thing whether it's HTML or JSON
[09:59:15] <tbws> MistuhKurtz: Ok cool, i'm using get to get the info, is there a way of loading in image content from a file straight into the element?
[09:59:21] <MistuhKurtz> I believe JSON is usually preferable since it should be lighter-weight and only have the data, which you can then in turn manipulate however you want
[09:59:53] <MistuhKurtz> tbws, you can grab the image URL and use that?
[10:00:01] <shahraship> MistuhKurtz: doesn't jsonp get around the SOP?
[10:00:13] <MistuhKurtz> JSONP works too but it's a bit of a hack
[10:00:24] <MistuhKurtz> and your data source needs to be valid JSONP, not regular JSON
[10:00:30] <tbws> MistuhKurtz: Not in this case, it needs to run when the data has come in from the server
[10:00:40] <MistuhKurtz> tbws, idk then
[10:01:13] <tbws> You can't leverage some of the functionality in load() to do it?
[10:01:50] <MistuhKurtz> I'm not sure what you mean by loading image content 'straight' into an element
[10:02:00] <Cork> tbws: yes, there is
[10:02:11] <MistuhKurtz> without simply using the image URL
[10:02:35] <Cork> tbws: you can load the image as raw string data from the server, base64 encode it in javascript, and set it as a data-uri in the page
[10:02:41] <MistuhKurtz> ^
[10:02:49] <Cork> tbws: that said, i wouldn't recommend doing it
[10:02:52] <MistuhKurtz> ^
[10:02:54] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[10:02:59] <tbws> Cork, you're the man.
[10:03:01] <tbws> ty
[10:03:08] <MistuhKurtz> why can't you use an image URL?
[10:03:18] <Cork> ^
[10:03:19] <Cork> ;P
[10:03:21] <MistuhKurtz> haha
[10:04:13] <freeed> Hey guys.. I know this snippet (http://d.pr/n/uKJL) is really a poor method of preloading an image and fireing a callback on completion. Can anyone recommend a better approach? Thanks!
[10:04:38] <freeed> firing*
[10:07:07] <CWSpear> I'm making a jQuery Mobile site, and I have some files that go into fullscreen mode, and you can click the top of the screen to get a menu to show up, but with the <video>, you can't click on anything over the video on iOS
[10:07:40] <CWSpear> Has anyone else encountered this issue or fixed it? I found a couple obscure points on Stackoverflow, but nothing really helpful that I could find.
[10:07:51] <BillCriswell> freeed: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3877027/jquery-callback-on-image-load-even-when-the-image-is-cached seems helpful.
[10:07:53] <CWSpear> It's not a z-index issue.

[10:11:42] <shwaiil> hi guys
[10:12:00] <BillCriswell> Yo.
[10:12:23] <six0h> hey everyone.
[10:12:31] <shwaiil> Q: I've got the following .attr('class').match(/[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9A-Z]{2}$/), to match for example 21-434-2E, I'm wondering how to change the regex to match 21-433-43_D ?
[10:12:35] <shwaiil> Thanks for looking!
[10:13:07] <BillCriswell> shwaiil: You can simply add _D before the $.
[10:13:30] <six0h> i'm having a little trouble getting jquery to manipulate my sprite sheet with a json file. i can $.getJSON the file fine, and i've got the page setup, but i cant seem to access the proper elements to get the adjusted background-positions of the sprites
[10:13:50] <shwaiil> BillCriswell: tks for looking. Yeah but let's say, it can be a nr or a letter
[10:13:52] <shwaiil> :X
[10:14:22] <BillCriswell> _[0-9A-Z]
[10:14:26] <six0h> http://home.codyhalovich.com/nsw/assets/demo/blue.json
[10:14:36] <six0h> http://home.codyhalovich.com/nsw/assets/demo/blue.png
[10:15:27] <shwaiil> BillCriswell:  thanks i'll try it =D
[10:15:35] <BillCriswell> shwaiil: Keep in mind your regex would match "#@(*$#(@*!*$#)@   kkkk21-434-2E" as well, not sure you want that.
[10:15:37] <six0h> http://jsfiddle.net/F3fQR/
[10:16:33] <shwaiil> BillCriswell: Yeh, it's fine! I want to get 21-434-34 or 65-454-32_Z
[10:17:09] <BillCriswell> shwaiil: Oh, then you need /[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9A-Z]{2}(_[A-Z0-9])?$/
[10:17:30] <six0h> i have to have this project out the door in 2 hours, its part of a much larger project, i really need somebody's help
[10:17:36] <six0h> my neck is on the line here
[10:17:57] <shwaiil> BillCriswell:  thanks a lot! What's the best way to learn regex ? I tried a few months ago but...!
[10:18:08] <Cronoh> oh noes your head is on the line
[10:18:13] <six0h> yeah
[10:18:13] <Cronoh> :)
[10:18:32] <six0h> i always sort this stuff out myself, but its getting close and im feeling the pressure
[10:18:44] <Cronoh> none of your links loaded for me
[10:18:45] <six0h> i need help from teh nerd collective that r my brotha's lol
[10:19:11] <BillCriswell> I had a "10 minutes guide to regex" book a while ago that taught me some basics which has been plenty for me so far, if I need a regex I tend to try to find s different way to handle it haha.
[10:19:15] <six0h> http://jsfiddle.net/F3fQR/1/
[10:19:20] <six0h> i updated, works now
[10:19:42] <BillCriswell> They're nice for if I need to hack up a text file or something silly but I try to avoid them in public cod
[10:19:43] <BillCriswell> code*
[10:19:59] <six0h> oh i wonder if fiddle is having troubles connecting to my local server. one sec, i'll move it to my vps
[10:20:35] <Cronoh> http://home.codyhalovich.com/nsw/assets/demo/blue.json
[10:20:36] <Cronoh> those links
[10:20:37] <Cronoh> dont work
[10:20:39] <Cronoh> i told u
[10:21:53] <six0h> http://jsfiddle.net/F3fQR/2/
[10:22:11] <six0h> http://aus.ionflo.com/nsw/assets/demo/blue.json
[10:22:13] <six0h> http://aus.ionflo.com/nsw/assets/demo/blue.png
[10:23:15] <six0h> again, im just logging to the console now, but i've tried every possible way i can think of to access data[0].frame.y and x respectively
[10:23:25] <six0h> and everytime it tells me undefined or null
[10:23:35] <Cronoh> well why function inside of each like that
[10:23:47] <Cronoh> w8
[10:24:21] <six0h> w8'ing
[10:24:26] <six0h> =]
[10:24:55] <BillCriswell> When "ait" takes too long to type!
[10:25:02] <six0h> haha
[10:26:20] <six0h> any australians in here? this is part of a big facebook app from tourism sydney :) i'll come back and link the app when i've launched it, should be next week. its not actually targeted at tourism, they're just giving prizes away to local aussies! :)
[10:26:30] <Cronoh> six0h
[10:26:35] <six0h> Cronoh
[10:26:44] <BillCriswell> BillCriswell
[10:26:46] <Cronoh> what browser u using
[10:26:49] <six0h> chrome
[10:26:54] <Cronoh> u using develpoer tools?
[10:26:56] <six0h> yep
[10:27:01] <Cronoh> what does network table say
[10:27:03] <Cronoh> u get repsonse?
[10:27:11] <Cronoh> i cant test it
[10:27:11] <Cronoh> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://aus.ionflo.com/nsw/assets/demo/blue.json. Origin http://fiddle.jshell.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[10:27:33] <six0h> do you just want the live page?
[10:27:34] <Cronoh> you should be able to use dev tools to debug it fully
[10:27:41] <Cronoh> alert (data); before looping on it
[10:27:44] <Cronoh> ensure it is object result
[10:27:55] <six0h> http://aus.ionflo.com/nsw/assets/demo/index.html
[10:27:58] <six0h> ok i'll check now
[10:28:05] <Cronoh> check your network tab
[10:28:14] <Cronoh> ensure it is receiving file
[10:28:18] <six0h> it is
[10:28:21] <six0h> its pulling in the json fine
[10:28:26] <six0h> manipulating it is the issue
[10:29:59] <six0h> http://aus.ionflo.com/nsw/assets/demo/index.html
[10:30:01] <six0h> check console
[10:30:06] <six0h> an array of objects
[10:30:06] <BillCriswell> frames
[10:30:07] <BillCriswell> meta
[10:30:10] <six0h> check again
[10:30:11] <six0h> refresh
[10:30:30] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[10:30:34] <Cronoh> yes looks good
[10:30:51] <Cronoh> whats the problem?
[10:30:53] <six0h> oh, i notice its returning an array of objects, and an object
[10:31:02] <Cronoh> yes i see that too
[10:31:02] <six0h> outside of that
[10:31:11] <Cronoh> app: "http://www.texturepacker.com"
[10:31:15] <six0h> how do i access JUST the array of objects?
[10:31:21] <six0h> i hadn't noticed that before
[10:31:36] <Cronoh> each on each
[10:31:41] <Cronoh> i hink
[10:31:48] <Cronoh> you can check type
[10:31:57] <six0h> typeof == array?
[10:32:04] <Cronoh> they are 0 => object, 1=> object
[10:32:10] <Cronoh> "meta" -> object
[10:32:36] <Cronoh> oh
[10:32:38] <Cronoh> its frames
[10:32:44] <Cronoh> sec do this
[10:33:09] <Cronoh> it should be
[10:33:10] <BillCriswell> Why can't you do $.each( frames, function(idx, el){ }); ?
[10:33:11] <Cronoh> data.frames
[10:33:13] <Cronoh> loop on that
[10:33:20] <BillCriswell> data.frames *
[10:33:48] <Cronoh> problem for you us you dont know how you structed your original json file lols
[10:34:00] <six0h> i didn't structure it unfortunately
[10:34:11] <Cronoh> but yes i should have read it more carefully
[10:34:12] <six0h> this was given to me at 4am this morning by the project manager
[10:34:21] <six0h> first the project was html5, then it was flash, now its spritesheets
[10:34:24] <six0h> its been a nightmare
[10:34:26] <Cronoh> lol
[10:34:26] <BillCriswell> six0h: Dick punch is in order.
[10:34:57] <six0h> well, he's been up until 4am with me recovering from the massive fail that was the art studio
[10:34:59] <aqeel> hi room
[10:35:07] <six0h> so he's cool
[10:35:07] <six0h> lol
[10:35:34] <aqeel> hey guys any know how to tackle the opera focus and blur issue...
[10:35:35] <Cronoh> consider your neck saved
[10:36:27] <six0h> nice one, well ill try to animate this now and show the results :) the amazing opening box lid that cost 10k+. terrible.
[10:36:36] <Cronoh> lool
[10:36:53] <six0h> the whole thing should have just been done in flash. its a facebook page tab so it doesn't work on mobiles anyways
[10:37:02] <aqeel> if opera is open and on top of all windows gets focus and any window on top of it makes it blur but within the web page if therre is anything that makes it lose page focus will not trigger blur for opera window
[10:37:56] <aqeel> strange behaviour
[10:38:20] <aqeel> how can i reroute it so it can be solved
[10:39:47] <BillCriswell> six0h: 10K?!
[10:39:54] <six0h> no joke
[10:39:57] <BillCriswell> Fuck I'm cheap. I feel like a whore.
[10:41:06] <six0h> they're a fairly big agency that did the artwork
[10:41:15] <aqeel> opera focus tend to work along with window....if window is top so focus is true but if any other window is on top thus blur is true.....
[10:41:19] <six0h> but this box lid opening is the focus lol
[10:41:37] <BillCriswell> That images takes a while to load, for me at least.
[10:41:58] <six0h> its 1.2mb
[10:42:03] <BillCriswell> also, wouldn't it be easier to just have the images stacked one on top of the other?
[10:42:05] <six0h> and its hosted in aus. i dont know where you are
[10:42:17] <BillCriswell> I'm in the states.
[10:42:19] <BillCriswell> MERICA
[10:42:20] <six0h> yes, but thats not the way flash decided to output it
[10:42:26] <six0h> yea im in canada it loads slow for me too
[10:42:32] <BillCriswell> six0h: That blows.
[10:43:26] <BillCriswell> -= 200 is a lot nicer than all that x, y non-sense.
[10:43:34] <six0h> yeah
[10:43:45] <six0h> the issue is, its 3 columns
[10:43:50] <six0h> of frames
[10:44:07] <six0h> in the png
[10:44:19] <six0h> so i need the coords from the json object
[10:44:36] <BillCriswell> six0h: Yeah, that stinks.
[10:44:45] <six0h> if i did it, it would have been one giant column of frames
[10:44:46] <six0h> thats easy
[10:44:54] <BillCriswell> Yeah, definitely.
[10:45:31] <BillCriswell> Why not just edit it in photoshop to be one large column?
[10:45:58] <BillCriswell> You could avoid the ajax request and all that shit.
[10:46:10] <six0h> i have a feeling its going to come to that
[10:46:11] <slick-> how can i tell if the person is using windows version of chrome
[10:46:14] <slick-> using jquery
[10:46:22] <slick-> I'm having a cross browser problem that only shows up on windows chrome
[10:46:41] <six0h> then i can use setInterval and control the animation time without jquery delay's too
[10:47:05] <six0h> (not that there's anything wrong with jquery delay's ;) )
[10:47:17] <BillCriswell> six0h: Absolutely.
[10:48:17] <aqeel> slick what is your problem
[10:49:51] <slick-> i just have to change margin-top for windows chrome
[10:49:58] <BillCriswell> six0h: WHAT'S IN THIS BOX?
[10:49:58] <slick-> but i need to detect if its windows + chrome
[10:49:59] <slick-> first
[10:50:02] <slick-> how do i do that
[10:50:04] <slick-> i can't find anything
[10:50:11] <six0h> BillCriswell prizes
[10:50:13] <slick-> var isChrome = window.chrome;
[10:50:14] <slick-> if(isChrome) { >
[10:50:18] <BillCriswell> I love prized.
[10:50:22] <BillCriswell> prizes*
[10:50:45] <six0h> especially BillCriswell prizes
[10:51:21] <aqeel> chrome has its own windows properties.........using window.chrome
[10:51:47] <BillCriswell> slick-: Do you have some code for your issue?
[10:52:14] <slick-> i know how to resolve the issue i just need to know if its chrome
[10:52:17] <slick-> so i can set margin-top differently
[10:52:21] <aqeel> i am also having cross browser issues....
[10:52:27] <slick-> i guess window.chrome will tell me
[10:52:39] <slick-> story of my life
[10:52:40] <aqeel> opera and chrome behave totally different to ie and firfox
[10:52:41] <slick-> (life of a web dev)
[10:53:05] <BillCriswell> slick-: There might be a better way around the issue though.
[10:53:22] <slick-> it works fine on every browser including chrome os x
[10:53:28] <slick-> doesn't work on windows chrome
[10:53:32] <slick-> i don't think there is an easy way around this
[10:53:36] <slick-> than to detect if i i have windows chrome
[10:53:40] <slick-> and do a different margin-top
[10:53:48] <aqeel> well chrome offline shows correctly but online displays jiblish stuff
[10:55:40] <BillCriswell> slick-: Should be able to do something navigator.userAgent if you insist.
[10:56:08] <slick-> that will tell me if its chrome?
[10:56:14] <aqeel> ii have seven items and float it left ......every alternate is floated only......2,4,6 are properly floated but,1,3,5,7 are out of its proper behaviour
[10:56:35] <BillCriswell> slick-: Toadilly.
[10:56:42] <slick-> sw8
[10:56:54] <BillCriswell> I don't even know what that means.
[10:57:24] <BillCriswell> aqeel: Has a fiddle or something of your issue?
[10:57:31] <aqeel> chrome seems to be most buggy of all browsers
[10:57:52] <BillCriswell> aqeel: I'll pretend I didn't hear that. =)
[10:57:54] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com........click the explosion and see in all browsers
[10:58:54] <aqeel> chrome even does not support resize=no property in window.open
[10:59:14] <jedimind> fucking chrome!
[10:59:32] <BillCriswell> aqeel: Why should someone else have control of my browser windows?
[10:59:53] <aqeel> not control but resolution....dependent....
[11:00:13] <aqeel> best is >1024x768
[11:00:16] <jedimind> someone.......... who likes ........... periods so much ................. obviously wants to control................... your shit
[11:00:19] <slick-> var userAgent = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase(); $.browser.chrome = /chrome/.test(navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase());
[11:00:21] <slick-> doesn't work
[11:00:22] <BillCriswell> aqeel: Says who?
[11:00:53] <hlve[NE]> ..............
[11:01:44] <aqeel> u see......some monitors having ie picks the resolution....1024x768 to be 980 x 737.....something along those lines
[11:01:52] <BillCriswell> slick-: navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf('chrome'), if you must
[11:02:27] <BillCriswell> slick-: No reason for a regex to look for  simple string like that.
[11:02:38] <slick-> thx
[11:02:49] <slick-> i guess if navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf('chrome') exists or not
[11:03:33] <say2joe> (/chrome/i).test(navigator.userAgent);
[11:03:35] <aqeel> so u see the float problem in chrome
[11:03:41] <slick-> if (navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf('chrome')) ?
[11:04:02] <hlve[NE]> Dear jquery, FIX YO PLUGIN SITE
[11:04:03] <hlve[NE]> http://plugins.jquery.com/
[11:04:04] <hlve[NE]> >:/
[11:04:39] <say2joe> ha! that'll never happen, lol. its been like that for over a year.
[11:04:43] <hlve[NE]> lolll
[11:04:54] <slick-> no lucj
[11:05:06] <say2joe> they should just put up an animated gif of a dude in a hard hat with a shovel.
[11:06:04] <jedimind> fucking animated under construction gif
[11:06:05] <jedimind> classic
[11:06:25] <slick-> i loved that gif
[11:09:14] <aqeel> i would like to create cross browser site but opera and chrome are giving worst times of all times
[11:09:24] <slick-> $.browser.chrome = (typeof window.chrome === "object");  works awesome thx
[11:09:29] <slick-> can i also find out if its windows
[11:11:03] <aqeel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8774560/jquery-detecting-the-operating-system-and-operating-system-version
[11:11:11] <aqeel> slick
[11:11:46] <slick-> thx
[11:14:08] <garciawebdev> can I concatenate/merge many promises into one?
[11:14:38] <aqeel> well i will go for opera first as it is not as buggy to chrome.....so what are the supported properties for window under opera browser
[11:15:02] <aqeel> sure u can...
[11:15:03] <garciawebdev> I have a method that makes one ajax call per page form and I want to return one promise for all those for another method to use it
[11:16:00] <garciawebdev> aqeel if Opera and Chrome are giving you bad times with your site, you are doing something wrong
[11:16:09] <garciawebdev> they have the best standards support
[11:16:55] <garciawebdev> FF and Safari are doing well also, but Opera and Chrome are rocking
[11:16:57] <aqeel> well u see....opera takes the window focus if it is on TOP of all windows else it is blur
[11:17:15] <aqeel> u can try my site and see it in opera
[11:17:41] <garciawebdev> are you talking about popup windows?
[11:17:43] <aqeel> open some other window and resize it place it on top of opera browser and you will see the status changed
[11:17:54] <aqeel> nope....
[11:17:56] <zfly9> Hey guys I have this site... http://zhlaw.six5webdesign.com/ and sometimes the jQuery slider doesn't show
[11:18:02] <zfly9> clicking the home icon will make it work, but I can't figure out why it wont work randomly
[11:18:38] <aqeel> open my page in chrome and opera....and see for your self....
[11:18:55] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com....click the explosion icon
[11:19:02] <BillCriswell> zfly9: Did you try adding the width and height to the images?
[11:19:47] <aqeel> if window.open() is popup then yes
[11:19:58] <zfly9> nope
[11:20:21] <BillCriswell> zfly9: Give that a shot.
[11:20:25] <BillCriswell> I thought I mentioned that to you.
[11:21:00] <say2joe> Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)

[11:21:00] <say2joe> Failed to load resource: the server
[11:21:21] <garciawebdev> aqeel, ohhh, maaann, you need a designer!
[11:21:44] <garciawebdev> it worked fine
[11:21:49] <garciawebdev> on both browser
[11:21:58] <garciawebdev> I don't know what your problem is
[11:22:16] <aqeel> can i pm you....for details
[11:22:34] <aqeel> as to exactly when problem arises
[11:24:01] <shoky> garciawebdev: you can do what you asked about using $.when
[11:24:18] <zfly9> BillCriswell, nope
[11:24:47] <BillCriswell> Weird.
[11:24:55] <aqeel> in opera.....keep the window open for the links to sites and place a small window of any other software , have it resized so u can se the text ...keyboard shortcut.......now place the rtesize window on top of opera and see the text changes
[11:24:58] <BillCriswell> Can you replicate the issue on the plugins site?
[11:25:04] <garciawebdev> shoky, thanks, I was trying that. can I do mainPromise = $.when.apply(this, promisesArray).done(...) ???
[11:25:20] <shoky> yes. though no reason to put 'this' there
[11:25:45] <shoky> i usually go with $ or null or something ;p
[11:25:51] <aqeel> garciawebdev.........
[11:25:55] <garciawebdev> shoky, it's for the apply method, accepts scope as first param
[11:26:06] <garciawebdev> shoky, ah, I see
[11:26:09] <shoky> garciawebdev: $.when doesn't need any specific scope
[11:26:13] <shoky> so it doesn't really matter
[11:27:21] <garciawebdev> shoky, but I'm using apply() to be able to pass an array of promises as an argument to $.when() (because it accepts many promises as arguments but not an array with promises)
[11:27:34] <garciawebdev> shoky, am I thinking it right?
[11:27:39] <shoky> right, you should use apply if you have an array
[11:27:43] <shoky> yeah you got it
[11:27:48] <garciawebdev> :D
[11:27:51] <shoky> ;]
[11:27:58] <garciawebdev> thanks!
[11:29:12] <aqeel> how to make opera behave in similar way as focus and blur does on other browsers
[11:29:53] <mcatch> does anyone here use ASP/MVC by chance for their server side of web development?
[11:32:24] <garciawebdev> shoky, another one, what's the difference between using .then(), .done() and .always() ? I know .done() is for when the deferred is resolved with no error and .always() for whatever status the deferred is resolved with. But .then() ?
[11:34:58] <say2joe> then is for chaining...
[11:35:14] <say2joe> you can use multiple thens to just chain along in order.
[11:35:50] <rmill> I thought then was to be used in conjunction with $.when() ?
[11:36:07] <forlamp> hi
[11:36:22] <say2joe> most often it is.
[11:37:18] <say2joe> you can also use pipe:
[11:37:24] <say2joe> $.getJSON("js/shirts.json")
[11:37:24] <say2joe> 	.pipe(function(d){ return R4A.ShirtData = d; })
[11:37:24] <say2joe> 	.pipe(function(d){ return R4A.getVoteData(); })
[11:37:24] <say2joe> 	.always(function(d){ return R4A.processVoteData(d); })
[11:37:24] <say2joe> 	.always(function(){ $(function(){ R4A.init(); }); });
[11:37:26] <rmill> Oh, I guess you don't _need_ to.
[11:38:10] <garciawebdev> and what's pipe() for?
[11:38:30] <garciawebdev> you cocatenate callbacks?
[11:39:00] <shoky> in 1.8+ , .then and .pipe are actually the same
[11:39:05] <say2joe> basically… its a lot like then
[11:40:57] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: you around?
[11:41:47] * hlve[NE] slaps Eviltwin around a bit with a large trout
[11:41:48] <say2joe> i prefer pipe because it reminds me of the CLI … someCommandOutput | nextCommand
[11:42:01] <raj> shoky! I've been trying to hunt your ass down
[11:42:03] <say2joe> but if i was using $.when() i'd use then()
[11:42:06] <hlve[NE]> SHOKY IS MY HERO
[11:42:16] <shoky> hey raj, hlve ;p
[11:42:17] <raj> he's got an S on his chest
[11:42:25] <shoky> raj i gotta go in a few min heh ;p
[11:42:27] <hlve[NE]> he's like superman, but better
[11:42:34] <shoky> but will be back in ~2 hours
[11:42:38] <raj> kk, no prob, we'll catch up later
[11:42:46] <shoky> coolz
[11:44:47] <someprimetime> say i have two functions and which are within a closure. there is a variable outside of both of them, that i reference in each of them. i can either pass it in as an argument or just inherit from that closure's namespace… what would you do? http://jsfiddle.net/vNRVP/
[11:45:53] <shoky> someprimetime: depends if you want a copy of outer, or outer itself
[11:46:07] <someprimetime> shoky: ah so my second way is just using it as a reference?
[11:46:12] <someprimetime> and the first one is making a copy
[11:46:17] <someprimetime> good to know.
[11:46:17] <someprimetime> thanks
[11:46:18] <shoky> yea
[11:46:42] <shoky> of course, if outer was an object, you'd only be copying the object reference
[11:47:00] <shoky> any modification to any fields in the object would still affect the original outer
[11:47:45] <six0h> hey guys, so i made the spritesheet one column, and the animations are trying to fire before the image loads, even though im trying to preload before hand. any suggestions? all the code is in the view source, its not in seperate files
[11:47:49] <firstclassfunc> why does jquery source begin with (function( window, undefined ) { ... } :: What's the purpose of undefined as a functiona rg?
[11:47:49] <six0h> http://aus.ionflo.com/nsw/assets/demo/index.html
[11:47:52] <hlve[NE]> $("body").remove();

[11:52:46] <hlve[NE]> hey guys
[11:52:55] <hlve[NE]> newWindow.focus() is throwing up an invalid property in IE10
[11:52:58] <hlve[NE]> any ideas?
[11:55:50] <hlve[NE]> Guys? HELLO?
[11:55:51] <hlve[NE]> :(
[11:56:24] <garciawebdev> this was working https://gist.github.com/4002292#gistcomment-592421 but now it throws a "Uncaught Error: UNSPECIFIED_EVENT_TYPE_ERR: DOM Events Exception 0 "... any idea?
[11:56:42] <garciawebdev> I log the event and it's there
[12:00:51] <gabrieluk> i have some jquery working with jsfidle, but not locally. how should i debug that? css classes are checked, html checked, i don't know where to look anymore
[12:01:07] <goddard1> i have several checkboxes and I am trying to get all the clicked checkboxes and send it via ajax but it doesn't come out as an array it comes out as digits in one string so $(".myCheckBoxes").val()  and this gives me myCheckBoxes = 30 instead of myCheckBoxes[0] = 3 and myCheckBoxes[1] = 0
[12:01:40] <goddard1> <input class="myCheckBoxes" name="emailFilesReply[]"  />
[12:02:18] <seutje> goddard1: why don't u just serialize the form?
[12:02:31] <goddard1> im sending it via ajax
[12:02:33] <goddard1> how do i do that?
[12:02:39] <seutje> ?serialize @ goddard1
[12:02:39] <bot-t> goddard1, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[12:03:24] <coj> does anyone know of an elegant solution/package for allowing users to multiselect from a collection? i'm looking at a tagging system (jquery tag-it) but it relies on the user typing a tag in, rather than selecting existing ones from a drop-down list. ideally there'd be a dropdown/popover that showed the available options and allowed users to select/tick multiple ones.
[12:03:41] <coj> someone just pointed me to jquery ui multiselect widget, and it's basically perfect
[12:03:53] <coj> but does anyone have other suggestions?
[12:03:59] <goddard1> seutje: the check boxes dont show up
[12:04:01] <goddard1> when i do that
[12:04:57] <seutje> well $(selector-that-matches-multiple-element).val() will only return the value for the first element
[12:05:34] <seutje> but if serialize doesn't return anything for the checkboxes, ur either using it in a way u shouldn't be, or there's a different underlying problem with your form
[12:05:54] <goddard1> yep and thats what i found out as well
[12:06:02] <goddard1> how does everyoe else do it
[12:06:08] <seutje> coj: looked into chosen?
[12:06:24] <goddard1> the form is generated by ajax and sent via ajax
[12:06:47] <seutje> goddard1: are you trying to call serialize on a collection of checkboxes or on the form?
[12:07:02] <goddard1> i called it on the form
[12:07:07] <seutje> oh ok
[12:07:18] <goddard1> should i do it on the check boxes?
[12:07:30] <seutje> no, u should call it on the form afaik
[12:07:54] <seutje> if all else fails, you can just iterate over your checkboxes and populate an array with the values or something
[12:08:42] <BinaryKitten> $(selector).map(function() { return this.value; }).get();
[12:08:43] <coj> seutje: woah, chosen looks very nice too. two great options to choose from
[12:09:00] <seutje> goddard1: what BinaryKitten said :P
[12:09:26] <seutje> she beat me to it...
[12:09:28] <BinaryKitten> actually that's not quite right
[12:09:38] <seutje> why not?
[12:09:40] <BinaryKitten> $(selector).filter(':checked').map(function() { return this.value; }).get();
[12:09:50] <seutje> oh yeah lol
[12:09:56] <goddard1> nice
[12:09:56] <BinaryKitten> :D
[12:10:06] <BinaryKitten> that gives you an array
[12:10:12] <BinaryKitten> of checked values
[12:10:23] <BinaryKitten> which you can then just send on through via ajax
[12:10:30] <seutje> like magic!
[12:10:47] <goddard1> it is magic!
[12:11:00] <BinaryKitten> i can explain it if you want
[12:11:05] <djsounds02> Hi, just looking for a bit of assistance with a drop down nav, I want my top level item to keep its background image whilst selecting through the sub menus http://recoilwebdesign.com/ftys/
[12:11:31] <dansalmo> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13201580/how-to-detect-input-button-value-with-jquery-on-submit
[12:11:54] <dansalmo> any help here would be appreciated
[12:12:56] <goddard1> BinaryKitten: sure
[12:12:58] <BinaryKitten> dansalmo don't hook the form submit
[12:13:02] <goddard1> BinaryKitten: i dont even know how to use it honestly
[12:13:03] <seutje> djsounds02: target .megaHover a instead of a:hover
[12:13:06] <Cronoh> hook  on the button clicks
[12:13:25] <djsounds02> on what line?
[12:13:27] <BinaryKitten> dansalmo: hook the form submit buttons click
[12:13:35] <BinaryKitten> Cronoh lolz
[12:13:43] <BinaryKitten> goddard1 ok   here goes
[12:13:45] <seutje> djsounds02: 411
[12:13:50] <seutje> how ironic :P
[12:13:54] <dansalmo> is there no way to do it with submit?
[12:14:08] <BinaryKitten> dansalmo np
[12:14:11] <BinaryKitten> *no
[12:14:20] <BinaryKitten> the submit event doesn't care
[12:14:54] <BinaryKitten> goddard1:  .map iterates over the collection calling the passed function for each item
[12:15:09] <BinaryKitten> goddard1: the "this" in the function is the native javascript dom element.
[12:15:26] <BinaryKitten> goddard1: that element natively has a value property, which we access and return
[12:15:32] <seutje> "You don't submit a BODY, you submit a FORM" haha, I love it when ppl skim instead of read
[12:16:06] <goddard1> BinaryKitten: like this http://pastebin.com/0zNYwFcY
[12:16:11] <BinaryKitten> goddard1: return values are stored in the internal array inside the original collection
[12:16:20] <BinaryKitten> goddard1: .get returns that array to you
[12:17:28] <BinaryKitten> goddard1 close
[12:17:36] <invisibleheero> Hey guys I was wondering I was wondering using jQuery is there a way of properly positioning an item at the location directly above another? Such as a notification icon? http://jsfiddle.net/b6dB4/ that's the code I have written but it doesn't sseem to go above the calendar
[12:18:14] <BinaryKitten> goddard1: http://pastebin.com/PaPfHkQY
[12:18:14] <gabrieluk> how do i see the jsfidle in full screen?
[12:18:24] <BinaryKitten> press f11?
[12:18:29] <garciawebdev> how can I dispatch a previously preventDefault() 'ed event?
[12:18:32] <invisibleheero> http://jsfiddle.net/b6dB4/1/ <-- that is with some of the fixes I've tried
[12:18:41] <BinaryKitten> garciawebdev you can't
[12:18:50] <garciawebdev> :(
[12:19:00] <BinaryKitten> you can optionally prevent default
[12:19:04] <garciawebdev> BinaryKitten that's bad news
[12:19:05] <BinaryKitten> what are you trying to do?
[12:19:42] <garciawebdev> BinaryKitten please look at this: https://gist.github.com/4002292
[12:19:58] <goddard1> BinaryKitten: oh ok so if i have multiple values I can just seperate them with commas inside the curly brackets?
[12:20:15] <garciawebdev> I want to do an AJAX call and after that, follow the clicked link
[12:20:24] <BinaryKitten> same as any other object yes goddard1
[12:20:36] <BinaryKitten> garciawebdev you know that it's not the same context
[12:20:36] <dansalmo> seutje: back at you. :) I am not submitting a body. If you even skim the .on() docs you will see.
[12:21:06] <seutje> dansalmo: oh, I know, I was lol'ing at that guy's response
[12:21:08] <BinaryKitten> also garciawebdev that delegated click handler is bad
[12:21:12] <Gho5t> anyone use tinyscrollbar plugin successfully with a win 8 tablet
[12:21:28] <garciawebdev> BinaryKitten, ooops, why?
[12:21:53] <BinaryKitten> too generalised selector, to precise filter
[12:22:10] <goddard1> oh man awesome
[12:22:19] <garciawebdev> Do you mind writing your comments on it, please?
[12:22:29] <BinaryKitten> try limiting it to the closest non-changing parent garciawebdev
[12:22:36] <garciawebdev> BinaryKitten I see
[12:23:00] <dansalmo> I see. lol
[12:23:01] <seutje> guess I'm going for a smoke, BinaryKitten types faster than I do anyway
[12:23:57] <garciawebdev> BinaryKitten, regarding context, do you mean I can't access event from inside the callback? isn't it under the scope?
[12:25:08] <dansalmo> it just seems more correct to be able to find the button value from within the .(on) submit than it does to have to find the form in .(on) click
[12:25:29] <gabrieluk> hi, i finally found the r
[12:25:34] <gabrieluk> error http://imagebin.org/234372
[12:25:53] <gabrieluk> what can cause that? i'm copying from fidle to local
[12:26:38] <djsounds02> seutje: that didnt work!
[12:27:35] <invisibleheero> Well if anyone is good at Math and able to help me position this icon on top of this button. My issue is that the links are dynamic, so they get generated at different areas on different pages. That's why I'm doing it this way. CODE:http://jsfiddle.net/b6dB4/6/
[12:27:40] <BinaryKitten> garciawebdev https://gist.github.com/4003738
[12:27:47] <BinaryKitten> try that
[12:29:38] <garciawebdev> BinaryKitten, I was just trying something similar, storing into data if I can follow the link :)
[12:29:41] <goddard1> BinaryKitten: still not able to get the info
[12:29:47] <garciawebdev> what's OriginalEvent there?
[12:29:56] <goddard1> BinaryKitten: http://pastebin.com/7bGZV7NL
[12:30:08] <BinaryKitten> garciawebdev a typo
[12:30:37] <goddard1> BinaryKitten: can you see any obvious reason ?
[12:31:00] <BinaryKitten> garciawebdev updated
[12:31:25] <freeed> Hey guys.. I'm fading out an image, replacing the source with a new image, then fading the image back in. Unfortunetly, while the image is faded out .width() returns 0. One trick I read about is to .show() grab the width, then .hide() quickly. That works, but on slower machines you can see the image flash on and off. Does anyone know of another solution to grab the width while the image is hidden? Thanks!
[12:32:10] <djsounds02> seutje: I got it sorted thankyou, I had to target the li hover rather than the a
[12:32:34] <BinaryKitten> goddard1 no
[12:32:46] <BinaryKitten> but i can see multiple dom traversals
[12:33:27] <goddard1> it doesnt give an error either
[12:33:39] <gabrieluk> how this is added to my code ​ but i cannot see it, only when i have an error in the dev tools Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[12:33:55] <BinaryKitten> goddard1 do you see the ajax request?
[12:34:18] <fission6> whats the preferred way to call a function after a delay
[12:34:31] <BinaryKitten> gabrieluk missing some context
[12:34:46] <BinaryKitten> gabrieluk have no clue as to your code or anything
[12:35:03] <BinaryKitten> ?mdn setTimeout
[12:35:04] <bot-t> BinaryKitten, .die() - Remove all event handlers previously attached using .live() from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/die/
[12:35:11] <BinaryKitten> ?
[12:35:13] <goddard1> BinaryKitten: yeah it goes through and it works but the only value that does't get posted is the emailFilesReply
[12:35:14] <BinaryKitten> ?mdc setTimeout
[12:35:15] <bot-t> BinaryKitten, window.setTimeout - Mozilla Developer Network - Calls a function or executes a code snippet after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.setTimeout
[12:35:18] <gabrieluk> some context. what is that?]
[12:35:45] <BinaryKitten> gabrieluk context is the thing that allows me to understand the problem and give you an answer that could work
[12:36:28] <gabrieluk> it is really funny. i can show you the jsfidle that works. the problem is when i copy that code to my local comp
[12:36:29] <BinaryKitten> context usually comes to me with "I'm doing X and Y happens" or "I have this code and get this error.. please see pastebinurl"
[12:36:49] <gabrieluk> http://jsfiddle.net/AbS2s/2/
[12:37:11] <BinaryKitten> right
[12:37:19] <gabrieluk> i took context for a technical term
[12:37:21] <BinaryKitten> now what's the code you have pasted it into
[12:37:37] <rjoerg> can jquery bind on "when element becomes visible" or "when display !== none" or something like this?
[12:37:53] <BinaryKitten> rjoerg no
[12:38:11] <BinaryKitten> rjoerg you can check if it's visible
[12:38:13] <gabrieluk> BinaryKitten, i just tranfered that code to my locl text files. i use komodo edit, on linux
[12:38:19] <BinaryKitten> but not run an event automatically
[12:38:22] <rjoerg> closest i've found is brute force: setInterval() perpetually polling the element to see if it's visible
[12:39:13] <miguelLN> I'm trying to determine the last <li> item within a scrolling area to stop the .css('margin', value)  any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/pcproff/NCrkE/2/
[12:39:20] <gabrieluk> BinaryKitten, should i upload my text files somewhere?
[12:39:46] <BinaryKitten> gabrieluk pastebin them exactly?
[12:39:51] <gabrieluk> ok
[12:39:53] <BinaryKitten> rjoerg https://github.com/jollytoad/jquery.mutation-events ?
[12:41:58] <BinaryKitten> gabrieluk sorry i need to go
[12:42:06] <BinaryKitten> though i'm sure someone will be able to help
[12:42:49] <BinaryKitten> goddard1: you might need to do "emailFilesReply[]" for the key
[12:43:01] <rjoerg> aha! looks like DOMSubtreeModified, but that it's only supported on chrome?
[12:43:19] <BinaryKitten> i don't have a clue
[12:43:25] <invisibleheero> I discovered because of the float left on the links that's why the notification isn't showing up properly. Is there a way I can get it to work WITH the floats?
[12:44:00] <invisibleheero> example: http://jsfiddle.net/b6dB4/7/
[12:49:22] <garciawebdev> BinaryKitten thanks! can I ask you again?
[12:49:22] <rjoerg> yep, looks like firefox is using MutationObserver, chrome supports DOMSubtreeModified, and IE is probably eating paste in the corner
[12:51:12] <invisibleheero> garciawebdev,  she's gone
[12:51:18] <miguelLN> I'm trying to determine the last <li> item within a scrolling area to stop the .css('margin', value)  any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/pcproff/NCrkE/2/
[12:51:19] <garciawebdev> :(
[12:53:15] <rjoerg> BinaryKitten: thank you!
[12:53:59] <seutje> invisibleheero: http://jsfiddle.net/b6dB4/11/
[12:54:28] <seutje> invisibleheero: should prolly preload that image, as it cannot get its height before it's loaded
[12:54:52] <seutje> invisibleheero: so onload, it'll prolly appear right on top of the menu element
[12:55:31] <seutje> invisibleheero: also, I removed some unnecessary float: left; declarations, as they were causing the <a> elements to be 0x0 px and shows in a corner to the left
[12:55:44] <seutje> which is why the offsets were... well, off
[13:00:32] <skione> hi all
[13:01:23] <skione> I am having an issue with opening a jquery modal dialog with a click event in IE9, if I set autoOpen to true it opens, if I set and alert to fire in the click it opens but when I try to open the dialog it fails without error
[13:01:25] <skione> http://pastebin.com/nH55UsuP
[13:02:04] <garciawebdev> invisibleheero or someone may help me
[13:02:15] <garciawebdev> having this evolved code: https://gist.github.com/4002292#gistcomment-592495
[13:02:28] <garciawebdev> it handles the event of a link
[13:02:33] <garciawebdev> to make an ajax call
[13:02:36] <invisibleheero> seutje, I appreciate the help. The floats needed to be there as it's not FULL page. It's just some snipplets I'll try the version you made. Thank you again.
[13:02:41] <garciawebdev> and after that, it should follow the link
[13:02:49] <garciawebdev> but it doesnt
[13:03:01] <garciawebdev> can anyone spot the problem?
[13:03:03] <seutje> invisibleheero: you need to float all of li, li a, li a span ?
[13:03:21] <seutje> invisibleheero: clearfixing some of your wrappers would also fix the issue
[13:05:05] <Alpha64> $("#parts-"+$(this).data('ot')).accordion(); this ain't working, can you explain me why?
[13:05:43] <Alpha64> the selector part is my problem
[13:06:47] <invisibleheero> seutje,  it's a Drupal template they have a bunch of clearfixes
[13:07:17] <seutje> invisibleheero: I know, but check the heights on your LI's and A's
[13:07:20] <seutje> all 0
[13:07:54] <seutje> still don't understand why u have to float an element that's the only child of its parent
[13:08:10] <gnarf> shrinkwrapping?
[13:09:05] <mouses> i use a mac. how can i test IE efficiently? i think i might have to dual boot windows 8
[13:10:07] <invisibleheero> seutje,  there's more items in there I just took those for the example
[13:10:29] <seutje> invisibleheero: oh, so just clearfix ur wrappers then
[13:11:04] <Kiai> mouses: I use browserstack its a payed service but its very very helpful
[13:11:13] <dblosevn> mouses: http://browsershots.org can work for small tasks if you dont mind waiting on the screenshots
[13:11:48] <mouses> i'd rather be able to interact and not just look at screens
[13:12:04] <Kiai> mouses: you can do that with browserstack
[13:12:06] <mouses> hmm, i think i might just go w/ a VM
[13:12:26] <dblosevn> just load up a vm on the mac then no need for a full blown windows install
[13:12:26] <Kiai> mouses: it allows all major browsers and allows interaction
[13:12:47] <mouses> proxying seems like too much work and if i lose my internet connection i cant test, right?
[13:13:43] <mouses> its weird that a free browserstack-like web app doesnt exist
[13:13:47] <Kiai> correct, but it also avoids having multiple versions of windows and vm and also updates as browsers update and includes mobile testing
[13:13:49] <mouses> seems like somebody would open source it
[13:14:00] <Kiai> its kind of new, hopefully in the future lol
[13:14:27] <mouses> cool, thanks i'll look at it and maybe try the free trial
[13:14:42] <skione> oops dropped from channel
[13:14:50] <skione> so please anyone can help: I am having an issue with opening a jquery modal dialog with a click event in IE9, if I set autoOpen to true it opens, if I set and alert to fire in the click it opens but when I try to open the dialog it fails without error http://pastebin.com/nH55UsuP
[13:15:12] <doug> ok, what's The Best Pagination Thingy for jquery?
[13:15:34] <mouses> $20/month isnt worth it for browserstack
[13:15:38] <mouses> good idea tho
[13:15:47] <mouses> i'm just creating a personal website for my business
[13:16:02] <mouses> not developing sites for clients
[13:16:03] <skione> you could get a whole server for $20/month
[13:16:43] <invisibleheero> seutje,  apparently I've copied something wrong because it's not moving it right.
[13:16:55] <invisibleheero> it's not adding the position style whatever to the element
[13:20:11] <invisibleheero> seutje, apparently it was a typo. but yeah that makes the element way off page
[13:20:29] <garciawebdev> okk, damn, links cannot be followed after an ajax call!! frustrated
[13:23:12] <redmunds> FYI, I just noticed that the link to the license agreement is broken (http://docs.jquery.com/Licensing: ) There's an errant semi-colon.
[13:26:21] <GunMan`> Hi guys. I'm having troubles running jQuery in a PHP environnement. Anyone got time to help ? Thansk.
[13:29:20] <BillCriswell> GunMan`: I think you might be a bit confused. What's the issue?
[13:29:21] <catcher> GunMan`, do you have a link?
[13:32:15] <BillCriswell> Ah, my task is "remove media queries, scaling, clean CSS so it makes sense"
[13:32:31] <BillCriswell> Just like that guys.
[13:32:40] <mouses> is there any reason to use xml over json nowadays in a php site? i find myself exclusively using json for all data
[13:32:41] <GunMan`> @BillCriswell : Well actually I'm trying to use jQuery.ajax() function to send a form (for it to be added in a mySQL database)
[13:33:43] <GunMan`> I'm actually having the SAME code as in every tutorial on $.ajax() in my own page, but it just doesn't work
[13:33:56] <catcher> mouses, the only time I use XML is when I have to work with MSSQL dbs.
[13:34:15] <catcher> GunMan`, do you have error messages or a link?
[13:34:42] <mouses> ok
[13:34:53] <mouses> my site doesnt use a db so i guess i'm good
[13:35:58] <BillCriswell> GunMan`: If you have some code you can show it would probably be easier.
[13:36:24] <BillCriswell> Basically... you just want to prevent the forms default action from happeniing and send the data using $.post() or something.
[13:36:44] <GunMan`> Link to the page :
[13:36:45] <GunMan`> http://beta.aerodream-fr.net/admin/index.php?page=news
[13:37:03] <GunMan`> click "Nouvelle actualité" (means add news) to get the form
[13:37:08] <GunMan`> form id #addform
[13:37:23] <catcher> GunMan`, looks like you have a namespace conflict..
[13:37:33] <catcher> $ isn't properly referring to jquery
[13:38:00] <GunMan`> jQuery code is line 102
[13:38:16] <GunMan`> Mmh and this is related to the fact that this page is PHP generated ?
[13:39:04] <catcher> GunMan`, not php-related, probably due to the way the scripts are being included.
[13:40:13] <GunMan`> my script is in <body> and jQuery is included at the end just before </body>
[13:40:32] <awc737> is there a one single .js validation file?
[13:40:53] <GunMan`> ?
[13:41:41] <BillCriswell> GunMan`: You wan to do the $.backstretch() down below where jQuery is called.
[13:42:03] <BillCriswell> GunMan`: Probably want to put it in that main.js file :)
[13:42:10] <gabrieluk> hey there, i'm having a bug in my code when i copy from jsfidle. anyone could check it. i tried saving it as a plain text than re-copying again, but the issue doesn't go. my text editor is komodo edit, on linux. this is the fidle i take the code from http://jsfiddle.net/AbS2s/3/
[13:42:29] <BillCriswell> GunMan`: You can't use $ before the jQuery script tag.
[13:42:46] <GunMan`> ohh okay :( didn't knew that !
[13:42:55] <GunMan`> thanks for the tip, I'll move the code to main.js
[13:43:03] <GunMan`> so what should I use instead ?
[13:43:26] <catcher> GunMan`, you can't reference jquery before it's loaded.
[13:43:29] <BillCriswell> GunMan`: You have a script tag right inside <body> first thing. That's causing an error.
[13:43:40] <GunMan`> ok ok
[13:43:46] <BillCriswell> your code *should* be fine if that's removed.
[13:44:06] <BillCriswell> Since you have it right before the </body> as well. =
[13:44:06] <catcher> gabrieluk, c&p seems fine in linux for me.. maybe komodo is handling newline characters incorrectly?
[13:44:40] <GunMan`> okay so If I move my code just after calling jQuery, even inside <body>, it should be fine
[13:44:45] <GunMan`> I'll give it a try right now
[13:44:59] <GunMan`> Thanks for the tip :) Nice to get help from the communauty :) !
[13:45:12] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[13:45:17] <gabrieluk> catcher, the problem reflects on the browsers also. if was only related to the text editor would cause the error also in the browser?
[13:45:58] <catcher> gabrieluk, you're sure it's not a code bug?
[13:46:48] <gabrieluk> not 100%, maybe could be
[13:46:56] <GunMan`> YEpeeeee that works :) !
[13:47:01] <GunMan`> Thanks for the help guys :) !
[13:47:02] <gabrieluk> but it is funny that it works fine in jsfidle
[13:47:11] <BillCriswell> GunMan`: No problem at all.
[13:47:30] <gabrieluk> catcher, may i send you my plain text files?
[13:47:36] <catcher> gabrieluk, do you have a live link?
[13:47:49] <catcher> if it works in fiddle but not on your site, it's probably unrelated to the code in the fiddle.
[13:48:09] <gabrieluk> i have only off line
[13:48:18] <catcher> whats the error?
[13:48:28] <gabrieluk> but it is 2 files, i will make a pastebin, so you can open locally, k?
[13:49:13] <catcher> gabrieluk, definitely need to know what the problem is.
[13:49:14] <gabrieluk> the error is: on komodo edit---> Javascript: syntaxError: illegal character
[13:49:35] <catcher> which character?
[13:49:36] <gabrieluk> catcher, i show you the blog post i found about
[13:49:54] <gabrieluk> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4404526/unexpected-token-illegal-in-webkit
[13:50:10] <gabrieluk> unexpected-token-illegal-in-webkit, is the error i have on webkit
[13:51:31] <catcher> gabrieluk, there's a whitespace before the opening $, might be worth looking at. Next likely culprit is the blank newline.
[13:51:44] <catcher> gabrieluk, unless the issue is unrelated to this code. :)
[13:52:47] <gabrieluk> i have 1 clue, in the post, there's 1 part that it says about spliting the <script> tag, when Henrik N answer
[13:53:19] <gabrieluk> i had remove all spaces from everywhere in the code, and it still does
[13:53:33] <gabrieluk> i think is realted to that thing about spliting the script tag
[13:53:37] <catcher> gabrieluk, does that empty script tag need to be there?
[13:53:58] <gabrieluk> catcher, i have a spacer. wouldn't b that my issue
[13:53:59] <gabrieluk> ?
[13:54:10] <datmw> good evening guys
[13:54:15] <gabrieluk> should i split the spacer?
[13:54:52] <datmw> i've a little issue with jquery/ajax/php session, someone here with some experience regarding this combination?
[13:55:32] <gabrieluk> catcher, 1 sec, i send you my files
[13:55:46] <awc737> is it possible to refer the form object with jQuery.each(jQuery(this).serializeArray(), function(i, field) {
[13:56:26] <awc737> I'm trying to do something like this
[13:56:26] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/9pS
[13:56:40] <awc737> if field.name hasClass requred...
[13:56:48] <awc737> but I think when I serialize it, it's no longer referencing the object
[13:56:52] <zfly9> Hey guys I have this site... http://zhlaw.six5webdesign.com/ and sometimes the jQuery slider doesn't show
[13:56:54] <zfly9> clicking the home icon will make it work, but I can't figure out why it wont work randomly
[13:58:21] <catcher> zfly9, some of your images can't be found, that could be related.
[13:58:36] <awc737> so can I use hasClass on field if field is achieved by this:
[13:58:39] <awc737> jQuery.each(jQuery(this).serializeArray(), function(i, field) {
[13:59:03] <kriegerod> I'd like to report that on page http://docs.jquery.com/How_jQuery_Works a phrase is incorrect: "Also, while the custom script is included in the <head>", but it is inside <body>. Could somebody contact website staff about this?
[14:01:53] <datmw> everytime I hit the refresh button I seem to lose the php session which is set within ajax-calls to the same url which previously delivered the page. Known issue?
[14:03:45] <say2joe> kriegerod: http://bugs.jquery.com/newticket?redirectedfrom=
[14:07:51] <gabrieluk> catcher, http://pastebin.com/t53qhZi3
[14:11:34] <catcher> gabrieluk, looks like there's some nastiness at the very end of the js
[14:11:57] <catcher> gabrieluk, start by deleting & re-typing the last few characters
[14:11:57] <gabrieluk> yes?
[14:12:27] <MrPunkin> Can anyone tell me why jQuery animations are flickering in mobile Safari? I'd love to stick to JS for my animations rather than convert it all to CSS btu at least the CSS is smooth and can leverage the hardware rendering
[14:12:50] <catcher> gabrieluk, or just try this: http://pastebin.com/7j5TJCTN
[14:14:31] <say2joe> MrPunkin: I just ran across similar issue. You're using Safari v5 or less?
[14:14:48] <MrPunkin> iOS6, so whatever that is… but needs to be compat with all 3.2+ iOS
[14:15:39] <say2joe> There's issues with redrawing objects… if you're going to use jQuery the best you can hope for is adjusting animation speed. Ran into same issue even when trying css3 transitions.
[14:16:23] <say2joe> Safari 6 has resolved these issues with updated hardware acceleration, I believe. (Safari 6 did not have these issues for me).
[14:18:01] <MrPunkin> say2joe: I haven't had the issues with CSS animations at all because once you trigger the 3d. I guess I'll stick with CSS for now.
[14:18:40] <say2joe> interesting. good to know.
[14:18:41] <gabrieluk> catcher, i copied your code but it still doesn't work for me. it is really funny. now on komodo edit, i don't get any errors. but when i open in the browser, the script still doesn't work, and webkit throws a new error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of null
[14:18:57] <systemfault> afaik, only css3d is fast on ios :/
[14:19:03] <MrPunkin> Meant to say once you trigger the 3d you get the hardware accel. on supported devices
[14:19:06] <catcher> gabrieluk, that's the only error?
[14:19:27] <catcher> gabrieluk, sounds like the illegal character bug is fixed, and you're on to a new one.
[14:20:09] <say2joe> MrPunkin: interesting. I still had issues with Safari 5 though. Maybe it was the plugin I was using.
[14:20:37] <MrPunkin> say2joe: when you say safari 5 do you mean on desktop, or do you mean iOS5's version of mobile safari
[14:20:58] <catcher> gabrieluk, you have no element with ID="sticker", so the jquery selector is naturally null
[14:21:16] <say2joe> oh. desktop.
[14:21:35] <say2joe> i see your point. perhaps iOS6 fixed some issues.
[14:21:53] <catcher> gabrieluk, you also need to space your 'var sticker' declarations
[14:22:00] <MrPunkin> say2joe: yeah, but I can't count on my users being iOS6, I need to support it all since 3.2. I'll try it though I guess.
[14:23:01] <say2joe> oh. hmmm. iOS6 included mobile safari 6 (or equivalent) though, i believe.
[14:23:25] <gabrieluk> oh, didn't realized i changed the id from the div. and about "space var sticker declarations", what that means?
[14:23:38] <zfly9> catcher the images work now but still facing that issue
[14:24:57] <gabrieluk> oh yeah, pardon me $varsticker was like this because i was trying to clean the code
[14:25:01] <gabrieluk> got it now
[14:27:34] <catcher> zfly9, try loading your carousel in $(document).ready(){ }
[14:29:01] <gabrieluk> catcher, thanks! it works :D
[14:29:13] <ltr20> I unbinded the "mouseenter" event on all elements by the one i'm hover hover on, but when i leave the current item i need all the othet item's mouseenter event to work again, is this possible?
[14:29:22] <ltr20> but*
[14:29:46] <zfly9> catcher do I have to wrap it in a function too?
[14:30:15] <catcher> zfly9, yepyep
[14:30:33] <catcher> $(document).ready(function(){ }
[14:31:07] <catcher> gabrieluk, glad to hear it :)
[14:32:12] <catcher> zfly9, if I'm to be accurate, $(document).ready(function(){ });
[14:32:41] <zfly9> catcher, still happens
[14:33:28] <catcher> zfly9, try wrapping it in $(window).load(function(){ }); instead
[14:33:45] <catcher> seems like a race condition
[14:35:59] <gabrieluk> catcher, i dced, thanks again. so, you just deleted few characters? how many?
[14:36:05] <zfly9> catcher, that might have worked..
[14:36:10] <zfly9> race condition?
[14:37:52] <catcher> gabrieluk, np.. I think there was one weird newline character at the end of the script.
[14:38:22] <catcher> zfly9, it sounds like your carousel was displaying faster than it could load the images.
[14:38:46] <gabrieluk> catcher, what does it means newline character?
[14:39:18] <catcher> zfly9, by wrapping it in window.load, you're making the carousel wait to load until the images have been loaded.
[14:39:38] <zfly9> ah very interesting
[14:39:58] <catcher> gabrieluk, a newline character signifies the end of a line
[14:41:02] <gabrieluk> catcher, i just ask this, because i start to delete everything, from backwards, and the error persisted till the middle of the script for me. it is like it didn't matter how much i deleted, the error was going up 1 line
[14:42:23] <catcher> gabrieluk, you probably had your cursor before the newline when you started deleting.
[14:42:42] <catcher> gabrieluk, best to start from the beginning of the next line, backspace, and give a new carriage return.
[14:44:39] <gabrieluk> ctcher, is that common to have such things in the code?
[14:44:45] <gabrieluk> catcher
[14:45:37] <catcher> gabrieluk, not common, but it happens
[14:46:52] <gabrieluk> pff, i was all day long trying thousands of changes x.x, well, now i know
[14:48:39] <gabrieluk> i may try http://tinkerbin.com/ , i don't like to have this problems with jsfidle
[14:49:18] <catcher> gabrieluk, unlikely jsfiddle's fault, bad input.
[14:49:19] <shoky> gabrieluk: it's a known issue with jsfiddle, it adds a weird character at the end of the code
[14:49:30] <catcher> or that.
[14:49:32] <gnarf> catcher: jsfiddle's code editing has been lame
[14:49:33] <catcher> really?
[14:49:47] <gnarf> jsbin is pretty decent too gabrieluk
[14:49:52] <shoky> when you select-all and copy/paste, at least sometimes, you'd copy that invisible character too
[14:50:00] <catcher> nasty
[14:50:08] <gabrieluk> shoky, i was all day to find that -_-
[14:50:17] <gnarf> gabrieluk: see ?jshint
[14:50:18] <bot-t> gabrieluk, http://jshint.com/
[14:50:31] <gnarf> gabrieluk: set up jshint as a part of your build
[14:50:34] <shoky> using a good editor should show you that kinda stuff right away
[14:50:39] <gnarf> or yeah
[14:50:56] <gnarf> get SublimeLinter or whatever linting your editor can provide
[14:51:17] <gabrieluk> yup, the editor was, but i wasn't familiar with such error also
[14:51:32] <gabrieluk> komodo edit was pointing the error
[14:51:56] <shoky> o well. now you know ;p
[14:52:02] <gabrieluk> ;P
[14:53:10] <gabrieluk> gnarf, thanks for the tips also, i will try jsbin
[14:53:43] <gabrieluk> and jshint
[14:57:16] <shoky> raj: here?
[14:57:29] <rgenito> yo yo raj whuazhaaa
[14:57:37] <shoky> bro-meister
[14:59:07] <Spec> Heya. I get an "insecure mixed-content" warning/error in IE8 when using jquery to add a relative css link into the head. If I put the full "https://fqdn/path/to/cssfile.css" i don't get the error. Anyone have experience with this? (example: http://pastie.org/5173982)
[15:00:05] <Jortuny> howdy. possible to select all children having a certain class, as long as they aren't children of elements containing another class?
[15:01:16] <Jortuny> right now i'm using foo.find('.baz').each(e), and checking if $e.closest('.bar') == foo
[15:01:18] <razzi> Jortuny, have a look at .not()
[15:01:32] <Jortuny> razzi: i was looking at .not - but how would i use it in this case?
[15:02:03] <Jortuny> could i do foo.find('.baz').not('.bar .baz')
[15:02:14] <razzi> Jortuny, $('all children having a certain class').not('they aren't children of elements containing another class')
[15:02:32] <razzi> Jortuny, yes
[15:02:33] <Jortuny> :D man. thanks! i knew it was going to be easy :)
[15:09:46] <shoky> Spec: try using protocol-relative URLS with a double-slash //
[15:10:24] <Spec> shoky: hmm. i was pointed to: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6079702/how-to-append-style-sheets-in-ie-using-jquery
[15:10:28] <Spec> which seems to work
[15:11:44] <shoky> oks
[15:12:36] <bil`> Can you pass a jQuery selector chain as a method argument?
[15:13:01] <shoky> bil`: for what purpose, and what do you mean exactly
[15:13:22] <razzi> what is a jquery selector chain?
[15:13:34] <bil`> for that method to execute https://gist.github.com/9fe68a5b3fdf7edf0e1a
[15:13:53] <bil`> selector chain like $('foo').whatever()
[15:14:05] <bil`> what do you call those
[15:14:12] <gnarf> statements
[15:14:15] <shoky> 'foo' is a selector
[15:14:20] <Spec> shoky: thanks though :)
[15:14:54] <bil`> OK, so I have a method and I want to pass it a jQuery statement to run
[15:15:34] <gnarf> bil`: f( $('foo').whatever() ); <--- that will execute $('foo') call whatever, take the return value and pass it to f()
[15:15:54] <bil`> ah
[15:16:02] <raj> sup shoky rgenito
[15:16:03] <razzi> bil probably means just elements resulting from chained selectors.
[15:16:16] <bil`> so in my case datepicker() returns an empty array
[15:16:32] <rgenito> WHUAZHAAAAA
[15:16:46] <shoky> k raj, whatup
[15:17:01] <bil`> can i pass it in as an anon function?
[15:17:04] <gnarf> bil`: sounds like you are trying to select something that isn't in the document yet, is this inside of a $(document).ready()
[15:17:04] <gnarf> ?
[15:18:18] <gnarf> bil`: you could function f( i ) { i().appendTo("body"); } then f( function() { return $('foo').whatever(); });
[15:19:04] <bil`> gnarf: https://gist.github.com/9fe68a5b3fdf7edf0e1a I have an inject() method that injects a string as html, and then should initialize it from the parameter passed to it
[15:19:19] <bil`> initialize it because its a date picker widget
[15:20:22] <say2joe> shoky: a bit late, but here's something i wrote awhile back which also handles printing (and adds a stylesheet). hopefully, its useful … https://gist.github.com/4004695
[15:21:51] <shoky> say2joe: thx but it wasn't me having the issue
[15:21:58] <say2joe> oh my bad.
[15:25:53] <shoky> bil`: you're running the DOM query $('.past-date-picker') _before_ the element is in the DOM, that's why you get an empty array
[15:28:50] <bil`> i put the jQuery statement into a function and passed that instead
[15:28:53] <bil`> works now :)
[15:29:43] <raj> shoky, just chillin at my cousin's place since I have no electricity or water
[15:30:24] <razzi> raj, because of sandy the storm?
[15:30:52] <bil`> thanks guys
[15:30:56] <raj> yeah
[15:31:46] <raj> razzi, you too?
[15:36:02] <razzi> raj, no, was just wondering, how do you get on internet without electricity?
[15:36:28] <luke_66> hi everyone
[15:38:35] <raj> razzi, dialup
[15:39:36] <luke_66> is it possible to output a file as a response from a ajax call? i've wrote a function for outputting zip files using an ajax call, this is the code: http://dpaste.com/823290/. now, from the firebug console everything is ook, but i dont have file output. what is missing?
[15:40:54] <razzi> luke_66, outputting how?
[15:42:41] <luke_66> razzi. i dont
[15:43:07] <razzi> you want the file to be downloaded by user?
[15:43:14] <luke_66> razzi: yes
[15:43:33] <razzi> luke_66, you don't need javascript/jquery/ajax for that
[15:43:52] <razzi> luke_66, just use a link and set the correct headers on the server
[15:44:14] <luke_66> I know. i swithced to ajax just for have the loader image
[15:48:01] <luke_66> now i'm working with the non-ajax way, and is fully functional.
[15:48:05] <razzi> i don't think it's possible with Ajax, not 100% sure though
[15:48:25] <razzi> JS can't save files as you probably know
[15:49:11] <luke_66> at least i'd like to know if is possible to do a similar 'loading' animation with a non ajax request
[15:51:22] <shoky> not really. downloads are not handled by the page
[15:51:23] <catcher> sure you can. just tough to get it to disappear.
[15:51:36] <catcher> :)
[15:51:49] <razzi> luke_66, i would like to know that also, pls let me know if you find some way for it
[15:53:46] <luke_66> catcher: wait. in the non-ajax way, how can i know when i got server response? i mean, i bind the spinner.show() event to the link.click() event...and then ?
[15:53:47] <shoky> it'd only be possible with some plugin/code with a server-side component that lets the page know about the download progress
[15:58:08] <shoky> raj: sucks. where's your cousin's place
[16:01:11] <catcher> luke_66, I was making a joke, making it disappear can't happen synchronously.
[16:01:36] <catcher> aside from some gross server-side magic.
[16:01:44] <catcher> as shoky pointed out.
[16:09:41] <Alpha64> where can i find the pbar-ani.gif image from the animated progress bar example?
[16:09:47] <Alpha64> it isn't on any theme
[16:09:51] <Alpha64> in
[16:15:08] <gabrieluk> hi, if i resize the window, the transition to .sticky is not smooth. If i reload the page, it is fine. but i need it to always fit as this is a liquid layout http://jsbin.com/welcome/43070/edit
[16:15:34] <raj> shoky, I'm in downtown manhattan, he's in midtown
[16:15:47] <raj> shoky, I'm currently sharing the computer, I'll be back in a bit
[16:16:04] <centennial> paulirish on hacker news
[16:16:12] <javalover> ok so I have a question
[16:16:22] <javalover> my site is really good but it will lag if I use firebug on it...
[16:16:40] <javalover> like say I have firebug running & I alt tab out of firefox & come back, it'll take a long time for the site to reregister itself
[16:17:48] <awc737> is "echo 'true';" the right way to get an ajax response from PHP?
[16:18:18] <awc737> or should I return true; or echo a boolean, or 1...
[16:24:05] <Alpha64> is there a way to put a progressbar inside a header for an accordion?
[16:29:24] <gabrieluk> can anyone have a look at my code? if i'm doing a sticky, do i need a spacer for the top also? when i resize the window, things go out of place unless the page is reloaded, which i don't want http://jsbin.com/welcome/43070/edit
[16:30:52] <seutje> gabrieluk: what's all this spin and stop stuff?
[16:31:49] <gabrieluk> spin and stop? what do you mean?
[16:32:18] <seutje> click the link you pasted
[16:32:31] <seutje> var spin = [ "Woahohaohaohaahoahaohaohaohaohaoha...", ...
[16:32:58] <gabrieluk> sry, idk
[16:33:04] <gabrieluk> for me it opens jsbin
[16:33:08] <seutje> there's css in both the css tabs and in the html tab, same with js
[16:33:15] <seutje> it does but it's all over the place
[16:33:51] <seutje> gabrieluk: http://i.imgur.com/fdrmk.png
[16:33:54] <seutje> that's what I get
[16:33:55] <gabrieluk> holy cow! i see now
[16:34:05] <seutje> I really don't want to debug this
[16:34:08] <gabrieluk> really wierd, i never wrote that
[16:34:18] <gabrieluk> naa, that is wrong, it is not my code
[16:34:26] <seutje> oh
[16:34:29] <gabrieluk> i don't have a clue how that got in there
[16:34:31] <gabrieluk> i swear
[16:34:46] <seutje> could u re-save and paste the url?
[16:35:36] <gabrieluk> just delete both css and js fields, just keep html
[16:35:47] <gabrieluk> in the html has all you need
[16:36:19] <gabrieluk> with the sticky script
[16:38:09] <gabrieluk> you need to resize the window  till the minimum, about 400px, to viw the issue
[16:38:24] <gabrieluk> seutje, the green bar bumps to the top
[16:38:55] <gabrieluk> it is not a smooth transition, as it should, as when the page is reloaded
[16:43:04] <shoky> gabrieluk:  sticker=$('#sticker').offset().top;
[16:43:22] <shoky> you only did that once on page load.. resizing the browser can change the offset though, you need to re-check it
[16:44:09] <gabrieluk> ah shoky, how could i do that? i really just starting with custom development
[16:44:20] <shoky> when you resize the browser and make it small, the big 'some stuff' text above the sticky gets wrapped into 2 lines, which pushes the green div downwards, changing its offset
[16:45:00] <awc737> does it make sense that I should be able to access elements[i]['name'] in this IF statement?
[16:45:03] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/9qN
[16:47:45] <gabrieluk> shoky, what is the solution for that? maybe should i set the height with jquery this way? should i add something like $(window).resize(function () { $('#sticker).height('100%'); }).trigger('resize'); });
[16:47:53] <shoky> gabrieluk a simple fix would be: http://jsbin.com/welcome/43101/edit
[16:48:05] <gabrieluk> ok,cool
[16:49:06] <shoky> but you should know that you're calling .removeClass and $spacer.hide()  on _every_ scroll event
[16:49:19] <shoky> same with addClass and .show() if you're in 'sticky' mode
[16:49:50] <gabrieluk> shoky, what you made?   $sticker.before($spacer);?
[16:49:51] <shoky> and what i did just added to the work being done on each scroll.. not the best solution
[16:50:05] <shoky> what? i didn't do that
[16:50:15] <gabrieluk> oh, sry, that was m
[16:50:17] <gabrieluk> me
[16:50:21] <shoky> i just added: sticker = $('#sticker').offset().top;
[16:52:05] <gabrieluk> ? sure? and how was it before?
[16:52:14] <gabrieluk> i think i had that also :/
[16:53:10] <shoky> did you read my explanation before?
[16:53:21] <shoky> i said that the problem is that you only did it on page load, once.
[16:53:28] <shoky> and that you need to do it again
[16:53:33] <shoky> so.. i did it again
[16:55:25] <gabrieluk> shoky, sry to make confusion, but i'm just starting. I still cannot understand. how you did it again?
[16:55:59] <shoky> gabrieluk: i just added:  sticker = $('#sticker').offset().top;    to the 'else' condition on the bottom of your code
[16:56:28] <gabrieluk> ah, ok, now i see. pff
[16:57:37] <imsky> you smartypants
[16:57:38] <gabrieluk> now i start to understand your explanation, it resets as the boolean is not meet
[16:58:19] <gabrieluk> like when i resize the window, and it is ELSE it reset the value of sticker
[16:58:50] <gabrieluk> shoky, nice one. i was thinking i would had to add something with trigger()
[16:59:26] <gabrieluk> like resize() than trigger()
[16:59:31] <gnarf> ?tell norakmcdonald just leaving a test message
[16:59:31] <bot-t> gnarf, Okay.
[16:59:49] <luke_66> catcher: i found the solution
[16:59:54] <luke_66> :-)
[17:03:25] <awc737> can anybody please help me get this proper async?
[17:03:33] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/9qV
[17:03:40] <awc737> if you scroll down you will see a comment // THIS IS THE PROBLEM
[17:05:12] <Eviltwin> ?ajax101 @ awc737
[17:05:13] <bot-t> awc737, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[17:05:33] <shoky> gabrieluk: this solution is somewhat better: http://jsbin.com/welcome/43101/edit
[17:06:31] <catcher> luke_66, what did you end up doing?
[17:06:56] <awc737> so Eviltwin I should have my return true or false in a function?
[17:07:00] <awc737> and call that function after the ajax?
[17:07:03] <Eviltwin> You have to use a callback function
[17:07:23] <awc737> yes, I thought I kinda was with .done()
[17:07:42] <shoky> awc737: don't use a simple loop
[17:07:45] <Eviltwin> Any function that uses an asynchronous function must also be asynchronous
[17:07:57] <awc737> shoky, for what?
[17:07:57] <Eviltwin> (As in it must take a callback function if you want a result from it)
[17:08:07] <Eviltwin> And it will call that callback function once the data is ready
[17:08:23] <shoky> awc737: you couldn't access elements[i] from the done callback because by the time the callback was called, the loop was long finished
[17:08:38] <awc737> oh thanks shoky i corrected that bit: http://paste.laravel.com/9qV
[17:09:24] <awc737> Eviltwin, so I should take everything in line 30, if statement, and place it in a function
[17:09:25] <gabrieluk> wow, that  looks good shoky, i will go trough now so i can follow
[17:09:45] <awc737> and then say if ( blah blah ) function(valid)
[17:09:54] <shoky> awc737: in the same manner, the 'return valid' will be called long before the done callbacks are called
[17:10:15] <shoky> as Eviltwin has explained
[17:13:06] <awc737> so then I need a function returning valid?
[17:13:14] <awc737> being called within done() ?
[17:13:16] <Eviltwin> awc737: http://jsfiddle.net/Dm6kQ/
[17:13:28] <gabrieluk> shoky, great, although i don't know well jquery, i know js and i can read somewhat jquery. 1 word, beautyful code. i didn't know you could set a boolean like that for the variable sticky and validates the class. amazing, thanks for the lesson an for the fix
[17:13:28] <shoky> i knew he was brewing you up a fiddle :P
[17:13:33] <Eviltwin> Always do
[17:13:47] <awc737> lol it helps a tremendous amount right now my brain is cooking
[17:13:52] <gabrieluk> beautiful code*
[17:14:19] <shoky> np gabrieluk
[17:15:44] <awc737> Eviltwin, in my code on line 4, http://paste.laravel.com/9qV
[17:15:54] <Eviltwin> Not going to work
[17:16:03] <Eviltwin> You need to change it in a way similar to the way my example works
[17:16:10] <Germanaz0> hello everybody, someone knows any good drag and drop file uploader, with IE support ?
[17:16:29] <awc737> but i don't get which line in your code is accomplishing the same thing
[17:16:32] <Germanaz0> or if will work without drag and drop on IE, but have some poor support
[17:16:46] <Eviltwin> awc737: Where I'm calling validateAsync
[17:16:47] <Eviltwin> Near the bottom
[17:16:49] <awc737> validateAsync(form, function(valid) {
[17:17:08] <Eviltwin> shoky: I'm going to BRB. Can you help him out?
[17:17:17] <shoky> ya
[17:18:00] <awc737> someone in my framework # gave me this
[17:18:01] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/9qW
[17:18:13] <awc737> is this different in concept?
[17:18:30] <awc737> they have a third function
[17:19:27] <shoky> awc737:  validateAsync(form, function(isValid) {  here do whatever you wanted to do when the server responds })
[17:19:33] <say2joe1> Germanaz0: Blueimp
[17:19:51] <Germanaz0> is IE supported ?
[17:20:16] <briley> hi, are there any CSS gurus in the house? I've got a CSS3 animation oddity I'm trying to figure out
[17:20:48] <gnarf> awc737: you could use something like http://paste.laravel.com/9qX where you return your own deferred/promise and resolve/reject it based on validation errors
[17:22:05] <gnarf> ?ask @briley
[17:22:06] <bot-t> briley, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:22:54] <gnarf> awc737: there are two common patterns for doing async work in jQuery -- #1 pass a callback (as your example showed), or #2 return a promise (as mine showed)
[17:23:04] <awc737> whats the difference between var response = $.Deferred(); and var valid = false;
[17:23:34] <briley> very well, http://jsfiddle.net/xRVFF/ if you click rotate until you loop back to the beginning the animations start acting up and I'm trying to figure out why?
[17:23:49] <gnarf> awc737: $.Deferred() is an object that wraps async callbacks-- you can attach callbacks to it (or it's promise) with .done( fn ) and .fail( fn ), etc
[17:23:53] <gnarf> ?deferred @awc737
[17:23:54] <bot-t> awc737, http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[17:24:19] <gnarf> awc737: for instance, jqXHR (returned by $.ajax()) is a deferred promise
[17:24:25] <gnarf> so you attach the .done() callback
[17:24:50] <gnarf> the .resolve() and .reject() will call then either the done or fail callbacks
[17:25:04] <Guest60057> is there a easy/standard way to get all selected items from a <select>
[17:25:15] <gnarf> only one allowed - first to the party wins
[17:25:33] <gnarf> either way, you still have a "callback" that is called AFTER the work is done
[17:25:34] <shoky> awc737: if you wanna use Eviltwin's code, you can change it and use it with your code someth like this: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Dm6kQ/1/
[17:25:35] <gnarf> thats the key
[17:25:44] <awc737> this is crazy
[17:25:58] <gnarf> awc737: it's not crazy, its asyncronus
[17:26:07] <awc737> i think i should use callbacks, so i can get a good understanding of them before moving on to deferred
[17:26:11] <gnarf> *asynchronus
[17:26:25] <shoky> well, the names are wrong now in my fiddle, shouldn't be 'validateAsync' as it doesn't validate anything
[17:28:44] <javalover> shoky?
[17:29:06] <jacobroufa> hey room
[17:29:07] <javalover> SHOKY!?
[17:29:22] <javalover> earth to shoky
[17:30:16] <javalover> alright well my issue is this, when firebug is open my site becomes slow upon reentry, like if I minimized firefox & reopen it...to the point where firefox crashes any advice?
[17:30:48] <dblosevn> do less ajax requests or close firebug
[17:31:19] <javalover> oh so it is the ajax then
[17:31:36] <javalover> my whole site revolves around ajax requests via .load
[17:31:39] <dblosevn> ya watch your memory usage bet its through the roof
[17:31:42] <javalover> is there something i'm not doing that can make it better?
[17:32:33] <dblosevn> im not looking at your site so i cant say really, but are you polling for anything?
[17:33:11] <javalover> not sure terminology but I would say that I request data & then display it
[17:33:22] <javalover> and that part is definately slow
[17:33:49] <jacobroufa> can anyone recommend a function like push() that will build a json object from other json objects?
[17:33:52] <dblosevn> polling eg... periodically requesting new info from the server
[17:34:03] <javalover> well I only do it on click
[17:34:11] <dblosevn> then thats not it
[17:34:22] <dblosevn> i meant like on a timer
[17:34:27] <VooDooNOFX_> javalover, profile it with chorme.
[17:34:30] <javalover> no...but I do loop through the data
[17:34:39] <javalover> maybe the problem is i'm looping in my .load
[17:34:53] <javalover> instead of looping say after the request is made?
[17:34:55] <dblosevn> ya profiling is the best way to determine where your code is using too much resources
[17:35:04] <dblosevn> are you looping .load?
[17:35:10] <javalover> no but like
[17:35:13] <javalover> the file I load has a loop in it
[17:35:18] <javalover> that loops through the data & makes an object
[17:35:34] <javalover> so perhaps that is an issue
[17:35:39] <dblosevn> ya thats not too bad depending on the data thats returned
[17:35:45] <javalover> i remember when calling repaint looping is bad
[17:36:08] <dblosevn> repaint in javascript?
[17:36:16] <javalover> no just referencing from java
[17:36:24] <dblosevn> sounds more like a vb or c thing
[17:36:33] <javalover> as that's where I first saw slowness in a program
[17:36:45] <javalover> but umm...is this okay say I have this
[17:37:15] <javalover> <?php $i = 0; while($i < 10000){$i++;}?>
[17:37:20] <javalover> say I load that...would that be a problem?
[17:37:35] <dblosevn> well depending on what was in that loop no
[17:37:40] <javalover> oh ok...
[17:37:44] <javalover> so then...what is it?
[17:37:56] <dblosevn> your computer could do 10000 cycles in a fraction of a second
[17:38:11] <javalover> yeah but this is so massive it crashes firefox
[17:38:16] <javalover> but only on reopening it
[17:38:27] <dblosevn> no if what you were doing in the loop was intensive that would be bad
[17:38:35] <dblosevn> *now
[17:38:39] <javalover> it shouldn't be intensive
[17:38:43] <javalover> the only thing it does is load comments
[17:38:56] <javalover> but I might be at fault for leaving that inside a .load idk
[17:39:02] <dblosevn> building dom objects 10000 times is intensive
[17:39:10] <javalover> oh i just gave an example
[17:39:16] <javalover> i only build the one time, so like $i < 30
[17:39:47] <javalover> and the loop only makes a string
[17:39:56] <dblosevn> ?demo @javalover im leaving in 10 mins though
[17:39:57] <javalover> which I then pass to a .html replace function
[17:39:57] <bot-t> dblosevn, Couldn't find "demo @javalover im leaving in 10 mins though" in jQuery Docs.
[17:40:03] <dblosevn> lol oops
[17:40:08] <dblosevn> ?demo @javalover
[17:40:08] <bot-t> javalover, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:40:25] <javalover> i'd love to give you a demo but my only question is, what are the rules for making .load not high in memory
[17:40:38] <dblosevn> .load isnt your code is
[17:40:58] <javalover> ok so what are key things to lave out of .load
[17:41:01] <javalover> leave*
[17:41:09] <javalover> cuz maybe that's the issue what i put in the php file
[17:41:11] <dblosevn> we dont even know what you put in
[17:41:28] <javalover> it just loops through comments & creates a string of html
[17:42:07] <dblosevn> eg... what does the browser have to go through to create that "string" of html
[17:43:04] <javalover> it calls my database & returns the data & then loops thorugh it & creates newHTML = newHTML + "<p>" + mycomment1 + "</p>"; like that
[17:43:59] <dblosevn> think my laptops telling me i dont have 10 minutes sorry bro, post an example and somebody will likely be able to help you
[17:44:06] <VooDooNOFX_> javalover, why are you making us guess? Go profile it with Chrome/Firebug :)
[17:44:07] <javalover> it's okay
[17:44:19] <javalover> i don't have chrome *sigh*
[17:44:28] <dblosevn> then use firebug
[17:44:34] <javalover> oh how I do it in firebug?
[17:44:58] <briley> does anyone know why a CSS3 "transform" property wouldn't always get set correctly by the browser? http://jsfiddle.net/xRVFF/1/
[17:45:58] <dblosevn> console -> profile
[17:46:04] <dblosevn> in firebug
[17:47:11] <dblosevn> then run your script
[17:47:16] <dblosevn> and click profile again
[17:50:30] <javalover> i don't see conole -> profile
[17:50:34] <javalover> i see console...
[17:50:46] <dblosevn> click console
[17:50:49] <dblosevn> click profile
[17:50:53] <dblosevn> wow......
[17:51:13] <javalover> theres a bunch of stuff like javascript errors etc...
[17:51:29] <dblosevn> theres your sign
[17:51:43] <javalover> no i don't have the errors
[17:51:47] <javalover> i'm saying in the dropdown menu
[17:51:54] <javalover> they have a bunch of settings like show javascript errors
[17:51:57] <javalover> but i don't see "profile"
[17:52:17] <briley> javalover: "Profile" is on the bar immediately underneath the "Console" tab
[17:52:18] <dblosevn> not in the dropdown.... click the profile button in the toolbar on the console tab
[17:52:38] <javalover> oh lol mine is grayed out
[17:52:52] <dblosevn> enable the script tab first
[17:53:05] <javalover> oh ok i refreshed & it showed up
[17:53:08] <javalover> sorry gusy that was noobie of me lol
[17:53:43] <javalover> ok so I see a bunch of stuff
[17:53:59] <javalover> anything specific to look for?
[17:55:24] <javalover> oh ya know what
[17:55:34] <javalover> i'm running it & some function is definately being called over & over for no reason
[17:55:51] <javalover> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh omg
[17:55:57] <javalover> I have a clock running on here...could that be it?
[17:55:58] <briley> that's a perfect example of something specific to look out for
[17:59:21] <[1]javalover> yup it was the clock
[17:59:30] <[1]javalover> disabled it, everything is fast now all of a sudden
[17:59:49] <Milos|Work> I need to be able to get slideUp() to wait and I can't use a callback because the stuff I am calling after it is way later in another method, but since it all executes so quickly the animation is still happening and basically I don't want it to execute that until the fade is complete.
[17:59:54] <Milos|Work> There MUST be a way to do this.
[18:02:18] <[1]javalover> Milos
[18:02:28] <Milos|Work> what
[18:02:35] <[1]javalover> the word can't
[18:02:41] <[1]javalover> is not in a coders vocabulary
[18:02:47] <Milos|Work> k
[18:02:53] <Milos|Work> how about "don't want"
[18:02:59] <[1]javalover> sure that is fine
[18:03:03] <Milos|Work> thanks.
[18:03:08] <Milos|Work> this has helped me a lot.
[18:03:32] <[1]javalover> ok so then
[18:03:37] <[1]javalover> perhaps ur problem is SlideUp
[18:03:56] <Milos|Work> my problem is that jquery can be quite annoying with ayncness :P
[18:04:14] <[1]javalover> right right but ur saying it's doing the slideup animation too quickly
[18:04:19] <briley> Milos|Work, do you have an example of your code?
[18:04:32] <[1]javalover> so the real question is when are you calling slideup & why?
[18:04:47] <Milos|Work> [1]javalover, because I like the animantion. what did you think
[18:05:03] <Milos|Work> briley, it's tough but I'll try make up an example
[18:05:18] <[1]javalover> but it sounds like you want the animation just later on
[18:05:40] <[1]javalover> why not call it after the fade?
[18:05:48] <Milos|Work> what fade
[18:05:55] <[1]javalover> after the "fade is complete" ?
[18:06:15] <Milos|Work> sorry, when I said fade I mean slideUp
[18:06:23] <Milos|Work> this is the situation
[18:06:46] <Milos|Work> there's a box, and when the user clicks a different box, that box will slideUp, be modified with ajax, then slideDown
[18:06:58] <Milos|Work> unfortunately it's being modified before it even finishes the slideUp animation
[18:07:05] <[1]javalover> oh i got you
[18:07:11] <[1]javalover> so your code is going off before the slideup animation is done?
[18:07:17] <Milos|Work> yeah
[18:07:42] <[1]javalover> and why is the reason you do not want to simply call your code AFTER slideup is done?
[18:07:51] <Milos|Work> that's what I'm doing
[18:07:56] <Milos|Work> slideUp doesn't wait.
[18:08:04] <[1]javalover> what do you mean by wait though?
[18:08:14] <[1]javalover> if you say slideup() it's gonna slideup
[18:08:16] <[1]javalover> whenever you say it
[18:08:26] <[1]javalover> are you looking for something to happen simultaneously?
[18:08:30] <Milos|Work> AND immediately continue processing code, like modifying the contents
[18:08:49] <Milos|Work> have you ever used slideUp? :P
[18:08:52] <[1]javalover> no but
[18:08:56] <[1]javalover> gui is my speicalty
[18:08:56] <Milos|Work> what.
[18:09:06] <Milos|Work> I'm going to get back to work now
[18:09:14] <[1]javalover> ok....
[18:09:21] <[1]javalover> but honestly I really could help
[18:09:30] <shoky> ok
[18:09:40] <[1]javalover> my biggest strength is gui coding
[18:09:42] <[1]javalover> but ok
[18:09:58] <briley> Milos|Work, could you add a callback to slideUp() that sets some flag that the slideUp animation has completed, and then add some code to your AJAX method that sets some flag when the data has been modified, and then check whenever those flags are set and only slide down when both are true?
[18:10:04] <Milos|Work> your biggest flaw is trying to help someone use a method that has asynchronous functionality without even using it [1]javalover
[18:10:23] <[1]javalover> no, that's ur biggest flaw, assuming that someone has to use something to know how to fix ur issue
[18:10:25] <Milos|Work> briley, I'll see yeah. it's complicated like that
[18:10:30] <Milos|Work> you're not helping [1]javalover :P
[18:10:36] <[1]javalover> i've solved my biggest coding problems talking to people who have NO IDEA how to code
[18:11:05] <Milos|Work> here's my gold medal
[18:11:07] <Milos|Work> for you
[18:11:10] <shoky> Milos|Work: use jquery's deferreds
[18:11:20] <Milos|Work> shoky, I've just been reading about those :D
[18:11:27] <[1]javalover> it's ok Milos
[18:11:58] <[1]javalover> you will learn eventually, but for now just go back to work
[18:12:27] <[1]javalover> see I had to learn the hard way, that I wasn't the most intelligent kid in the class
[18:12:33] <[1]javalover> but some people don't know how to let that go
[18:12:33] <Milos|Work> will you be quiet
[18:12:46] <stradade> hi i have a problem with a normal mail script... with this line var name = $("#name").val(); no valor bring behind
[18:12:51] <[1]javalover> part of coding is understanding you DONT know everything
[18:13:19] <[1]javalover> because coding in itself proves that knowledge along with everything else, is limitless
[18:13:30] <Eviltwin> How about we stick to actually answering questions
[18:13:37] <Eviltwin> Instead of going on rants about the theory of what coding is / should be
[18:13:39] <Milos|Work> THANK YOU
[18:13:47] <[1]javalover> I was lucky though, my java teacher taught me how coding is actually a representation of life itself, not just math.
[18:13:52] <Milos|Work> go back to #java
[18:14:45] <coldhead> [1]javalover: i am okay with that, since life itself is just a representation of math
[18:14:46] <stradade> hi all can someone see my code and help me pls http://pastebin.com/a8hC8U6L
[18:15:06] <[1]javalover> luls
[18:15:15] <stradade> i cant understand the button of my form work but the input text dont bring the valor
[18:15:32] <Eviltwin> One thing is for certain: Java is the closest approximation of hell that exists
[18:15:35] <stradade> var name = $("#name").val(); no valor bring behind
[18:15:40] <[1]javalover> i'd love to help strad, but i've never seen that code before so...
[18:15:41] <stradade> sry my english
[18:16:03] <[1]javalover> nor have I ever had your issue before so....
[18:16:39] <stradade> u saw here http://pastebin.com/a8hC8U6L
[18:16:53] <[1]javalover> no i'm sorry strad, I was informed by Milos that if i've never seen it I can't help
[18:16:53] <stradade> i paste html and javascript
[18:17:05] <[1]javalover> i recommend you go back to work now
[18:17:28] <[1]javalover> OR!!!
[18:17:29] <Eviltwin> [1]javalover: If you don't have actual advice to contribute, I suggest you quiet down
[18:17:32] <[1]javalover> I could just look at your code & help you
[18:17:41] <[1]javalover> which is what I will do, as clearly the above statmeent is retarded
[18:18:25] <stradade> anyone can help me ??
[18:18:53] <shoky> stradade: it seems to work fine:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/mKErX/
[18:19:13] <javalover> strad
[18:19:33] <javalover> ok so ur input text is not grabbing the value?
[18:19:37] <javalover> or the send button is not sending the value?
[18:20:02] <javalover> like are you saying in the alert you can't see it?
[18:20:04] <javalover> or in the mail itself?
[18:21:35] <stradade> in the alert
[18:21:41] <stradade> i cant see nothing in the alert
[18:21:46] <stradade> my button work fine
[18:21:54] <javalover> have you try'd just putting hello world?
[18:21:57] <stradade> but text dont bring the valor
[18:22:15] <shoky> stradade: it works fine in my link. i just pasted your code there
[18:22:29] <stradade> i let see u all the html code
[18:23:13] <javalover> wait shoky, you copy & pasted his code & it works?
[18:23:21] <stradade> this is all the html http://pastebin.com/bXpA3YMF
[18:23:48] <shoky> stradade: look at http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/mKErX/     it is the same code, and if you put a name in the editbox and click the button, you see the name..
[18:23:56] <shoky> javalover ^^
[18:24:19] <stradade> yes i saw the part i paste work fine
[18:24:32] <stradade> but in my html page dont worl
[18:24:34] <javalover> shoky while we're on the subject, I disabled a clock function on my site & it's no longer slow like wtf
[18:24:35] <stradade> but in my html page dont work
[18:24:43] <stradade> www.studiolegalebenincasa.it
[18:24:43] <shoky> oh you put a new paste
[18:25:11] <shoky> javalover: impossible for me to know what's going on, given your description ;p
[18:25:29] <javalover> it's just weird...i mean i copied the clock from someone else
[18:25:34] <shoky> javalover: "a clock function" could be any of and endless number of things..
[18:25:35] <javalover> but why would a clock make my site timeout
[18:25:39] <shoky> s/and/an
[18:25:40] <javalover> it displays the time...
[18:26:02] <javalover> so 12:42:12    then 12:42:13
[18:26:18] <shoky> it's badly written i guess?
[18:26:31] <javalover> could be considering my site no longer crashes after disabling it lol
[18:26:44] <javalover> honestly I thought I sucked at coding till I just disabled that i'm so happy lol
[18:26:55] <javalover> i mean sad face cuz no clock but...anyways lets help this guy lol
[18:26:59] <shoky> well it may also be a problem in your code ;P
[18:27:11] <shoky> that is going haywire when the clock is present
[18:27:22] <shoky> again, you haven't really given any details
[18:27:43] <javalover> haha, well...idk the clock was running in background I forgot it even existed
[18:27:55] <javalover> so I doubt it's my code but lets help this dude i just get a new clock lol
[18:30:31] <javalover> umm
[18:32:08] <Milos|Work> shoky, http://darcyclarke.me/development/using-jquery-deferreds-with-animations/ that certainly looks promising. I have implemented something similar to that, I will see if I can straighten it out. Thanks for the suggestion.
[18:32:10] <javalover> i'm so confused
[18:34:07] <javalover> hey stradade
[18:34:16] <javalover> i've been over your code like 10 times now I really don't understand
[18:35:06] <javalover> but I can take a guess...
[18:35:09] <javalover> <script type="text/javascript" src="js/mail.js"></script>
[18:35:27] <javalover> you have it as like an include...so maybe the variables are having a miscommunication as to where they're finding them
[18:35:40] <javalover> other then that idk
[18:36:40] <stradade> i will became  crazy
[18:36:57] <jshannon> how do i get rid of particular elements but keep their children... or delete said children if they're also said elements?
[18:37:13] <javalover> well listen you have "document.onready()"
[18:37:17] <javalover> but you're doing it inside include
[18:37:24] <javalover> maybe it's not going off idk..
[18:37:27] <jshannon> so in http://pastie.org/5174741 i want to get rid of all div.wrappers, but leave children that aren't div.wrappers (and if a child is a div.wrapper, the granchildren get moved up)
[18:37:41] <javalover> just try putting the function inside & not as an include
[18:37:53] <javalover> just to see if it goes off, i had some issues with that in the past
[18:38:26] <javalover> and if the alert is going off, try to see at what scope you can reach things
[18:38:50] <javalover> like if it were me i'd put "hello world " + $("#myid").val();
[18:38:59] <javalover> i'd put that in the alert just so you can atleast see if the alert is proper
[18:39:28] <javalover> what you want to do is isolate the issue, find out what your function can detect vs isn't detecting
[18:39:58] <javalover> it's highly likely that since you have the js as an include, it might not even be using jquery properly especially with that document.onload() part
[18:39:58] <shoky> Milos|Work:  you can also always do something like: var dfd = $.Deferred(), animPromise = dfd.promise();  $(elem).animate({...}, dfd.resolve);   then use animPromise.done(...)  whenever you want.  but 1.8 might have a nicer way to do that, not sure/done remember how
[18:40:38] <javalover> just try to figure out what is happening sequentially & i'm sure you will find your answer
[18:40:51] <javalover> the GOOD NEWS IS, the version that doesn't have it as an include, is working according to shoky anyway
[18:40:59] <javalover> so use that as a guide to figure it out
[18:43:15] <stradade> putting function inside dont solve
[18:43:39] <shoky> stradade: you have 3 different input elements in the same page, all with id="name"
[18:43:49] <shoky> so $('#name')  might not get you the one you are looking for.
[18:44:48] <stradade> no i have only one id="name"
[18:44:49] <stradade> no i have only one id="name"
[18:44:56] <shoky> in the original html you have only one, right
[18:45:07] <shoky> but something on your page is cloning elements i guess
[18:45:21] <shoky> because the devtools and console show 3
[18:45:30] <shoky> run this code: $('input').filter(function() { return this.id=='name' })
[18:45:36] <shoky> and you'll get back 3 elements
[18:45:54] <stradade> ok
[18:46:17] <stradade> now for try i give some strange id like id="4rt45"
[18:46:34] <shoky> stradade: your form is inside #slidertext
[18:46:55] <shoky> stradade: and you're running the carousel plugin on #slidertext. it's probably cloning the elements or smth
[18:47:29] <shoky> giving it a different id wont help you, whatever you have in the page will likely get cloned in the same way
[18:47:42] <stradade> ahhh
[18:47:43] <stradade> ok
[18:47:47] <stradade> i understand
[18:48:27] <stradade> so isn't way for use jquery i must use php for mail in that page
[18:49:12] <shoky> :o
[18:49:41] <stradade> or can i cicle all name element and take the only != ''
[18:50:16] <stradade> is a bad way ?
[18:50:57] <shoky> you just need to figure out how to properly use jCarousel , i dont know how to use it sorry
[18:51:08] <shoky> it is definitely jCarousel that is doing the cloning
[18:52:14] <shoky> btw you only need:  $('[id=name]')  to see the 3 elements
[18:57:54] <Keu> Does anyone know of a good client side Markdown converter for jQuery?
[18:59:22] <phonebook_> a minimizer?
[18:59:55] <Keu> A jQuery plugin that converts Markdown to html
[19:00:55] <snover> does it seriously have to be a jquery plugin
[19:01:30] <Eviltwin> Have you seen Showdown? http://softwaremaniacs.org/playground/showdown-highlight/
[19:01:49] <Keu> Not necessarily. The goal is to just quickly convert a textarea input of Markdown to html
[19:02:35] <Eviltwin> Keu: Showdown is theoretically Markdown -> HTML in JavaScript
[19:02:56] <Keu> I'll take a look. Thanks Eviltwin
[19:03:01] <snover> Keu: use marked
[19:03:10] <snover> https://github.com/chjj/marked
[19:05:02] <skypce> good night
[19:05:05] <skypce> i have a question
[19:05:34] <skypce> how can i do that update dimencions in resize window and do not in reaload it
[19:06:50] <skypce> http://pastebin.com/xi40E64G
[19:09:24] <shoky> skypce: what?
[19:21:30] <relipse> how come when i use jqueryui dialog if it is a really long page the dialog opens in the center of the long page (thus scrolling half-way down the page)...is there a way to stop this behavior
[19:22:30] <letterpress> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-position
[19:25:53] <stradade> shoky are u here ?
[19:26:45] <gabrieluk> hey shoky, unfortunately, when i inserted that sticky code in my actual markup, i still have some quirks when resizing the window. i had to replicate everything in the jsbin. http://jsbin.com/atimod/2/edit
[19:28:03] <gabrieluk> it is funny, cause in the previous jsbin we had, everything works perfectly
[19:30:42] <stradade> shoky can u help me to understand where this lib could clone my input ?? http://pastebin.com/99qvhBCw  :)
[19:30:57] <gabrieluk> those scripts on the right are just 2 plugins, fittext and lettering.js. the actual code we wrote is on the left
[19:31:27] <gabrieluk> on the html markup, before </body>
[19:32:11] <gabrieluk> the main difference now, is that i inserted fittext.js functionality inside of the sticky plugin, not sure if that matters
[19:40:48] <gabrieluk> shoky, things are better now. i removed all the extra js plugins, and i still have the quirk. is in the html or css... http://jsbin.com/odobad/1/edit
[19:44:30] <gabrieluk> i also clean up the css http://jsbin.com/eqexit/1/edit
[19:46:43] <fission6> does nestedf unctions get scope to a parameter passed into the parent function
[19:53:25] <gabrieluk> shoky, nvm, i implement the first fix, the one within the ELSE statment. it works. http://jsbin.com/ozafay/1/edit
[19:56:57] <Milos|Work> shoky, by the way, using promise on $('div') with the ajax method in the callback worked amazingly well.
[20:06:15] <jacobroufa> hey room
[20:06:48] <jacobroufa> im getting a "Mismatching fragment identifier" error on my page here http://e-rockford.com/elections/widget/test.html
[20:06:59] <jacobroufa> search says its because im using incompatible jquery versions
[20:07:07] <jacobroufa> but i have latest for both jquery and jquery ui
[20:08:09] <jacobroufa> any ideas?
[20:08:30] <coldhead> jacobroufa: i would venture it's because some of your IDs start with a number
[20:08:45] <coldhead> try prepending _ or something to those and the hrefs
[20:08:55] <jacobroufa> hrm
[20:08:57] <jacobroufa> one sec
[20:09:57] <jacobroufa> nope, that didnt do it
[20:09:57] <coldhead> still not happy huh
[20:10:13] <coldhead> oh shit
[20:10:18] <coldhead> you have # in your ids
[20:10:29] <coldhead> id="#id"
[20:10:35] <coldhead> should be just id="id"
[20:10:37] <jacobroufa> HA!
[20:10:39] <jacobroufa> OH MAN
[20:10:45] <jacobroufa> lol
[20:10:48] * jacobroufa punches himself
[20:10:55] <jacobroufa> what a noob mistake
[20:11:20] <coldhead> its subtle, it looks right
[20:11:28] <coldhead> don't take it hard
[20:11:30] <jacobroufa> right?
[20:11:34] <jacobroufa> man oh man
[20:11:36] <jacobroufa> perfect
[20:11:38] <jacobroufa> thanks coldhead
[20:11:45] <coldhead> you're welcome! good luck
[20:11:58] <jacobroufa> sometimes thats all it takes is one other person looking at the simplest code when ive been staring at my monitor too long :p
[20:13:48] <abjorn> http://imgur.com/Jx8dC lolll
[20:14:39] <coldhead> it could have been me
[20:14:47] <abjorn> >teenage suicide in russia is endemic
[20:14:48] <abjorn> y
[20:14:54] <coldhead> i need to check out that cartoon
[20:14:58] <abjorn> no you don't
[20:15:04] <abjorn> obv it kills people
[20:15:15] <coldhead> that's a virtue!
[20:17:24] <jacobroufa> yeesh
[20:21:42] <coldhead> i'm off for a walk, then to watch some ghost in the shell and maybe kill myself. pray that my favourite characters aren't killed off i guess
[20:28:45] <awc737> shoky, gnarf, Eviltwin, thanks for your help much earlier, I have it working with a callback, and starting to udnerstand callbacks
[20:29:06] <IAS> Z?
[20:29:09] <awc737> although I find it odd the ajax response is sent to the callback, given this: }).done(callback);
[20:29:18] <awc737> I would think it must be .done(callback(data));
[20:29:42] <IAS> hey guys
[20:34:06] <gnarf> awc737: callback(data) immediately calls callback using "data"
[20:35:11] <awc737> gnarf, but what about just callback, with no argument
[20:35:20] <awc737> it sends the data parameter automatically?
[20:37:39] <awc737> gnarf, see line 58 http://paste.laravel.com/9sc
[20:37:41] <jacobroufa> awc737: if using .done, yeah
[20:37:48] <gnarf> awc737: .done() calls the callback provide with "data" when it calls it
[20:37:49] <awc737> oh so .done has some magic
[20:37:53] <jacobroufa> :)
[20:37:57] <gnarf> not "magic"
[20:38:11] <jacobroufa> HAHAHA
[20:38:17] <jacobroufa> gnarf: to us noobs it is
[20:38:26] <gnarf> it just calls "callback( data )"
[20:38:27] <awc737> haha
[20:39:22] <gnarf> ?js function callMe( callback ) { callback( "OMG" ); }   callMe(function( omg ) { console.log( omg ); });
[20:39:26] <bot-t> gnarf: "OMG"
[20:39:51] <awc737> what just happened...
[20:40:08] <jacobroufa> awc737: the bot ran the js gnarf fed it
[20:40:10] <awc737> this channel has a javascript parsing bot
[20:40:27] <StevenCodes22> :D
[20:40:37] <shoky> browsers can do it, why not bots.
[20:41:26] <awc737> the only thing that gets me about my new way of accomplishing this, with callbacks, is that my logic is now getting separated
[20:41:26] <jacobroufa> f'in a, shoky... f'in a...
[20:41:29] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/9sd
[20:41:46] <shoky> separation is good
[20:41:48] <awc737> see I was hoping to do all the error appending in that validate function
[20:41:52] <awc737> no I don't mean like that
[20:42:06] <awc737> this stuff here var formError = jQuery('<span class="form-error tooltip";>This field is required</span>').insertAfter(jQuery(elements[i]));
[20:42:30] <awc737> and now I am doing some if it within the validate function (for //required), and some of it back up top for //customer name / number
[20:42:42] <shoky> too tired to go over code sry
[20:42:45] <awc737> np
[20:43:01] <StevenCodes22> too tired to care not at all sorry
[20:44:00] <awc737> so that means, you care somewhat...?
[20:44:18] <gnarf> ?101 @awc737
[20:44:19] <bot-t> awc737, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[20:44:44] <shoky> i think he means he's not at all sorry ;p
[20:44:45] <awc737> you are too tired to care not at all, so you are awake enough to care somewhat would be the inverse no?
[20:44:48] <awc737> lol
[20:44:59] <StevenCodes22> hmm
[20:45:17] <StevenCodes22> I like it
[20:45:19] <awc737> ooh, hes contemplating caring... i can sense it
[20:45:30] <StevenCodes22> awc737,  What do you need ?
[20:45:43] <awc737> he cares!
[20:45:43] <StevenCodes22> You've intrigued me
[20:45:45] <shoky> now he's sorry he cared not at all
[20:45:46] <awc737> haha
[20:46:10] <StevenCodes22> shoky, I'm starting to feel sorry I cared that little bit lol
[20:46:14] <awc737> haha
[20:46:34] <shoky> y u
[20:46:37] <b-ot> (屮'Д')屮
[20:46:43] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/9sd
[20:46:56] <awc737> i just want to get my jQuery('#jform_profile_custnum').addClass('invalid'); statements all together
[20:47:04] <awc737> i'll put a comment on them, theres 4 of them in that paste
[20:47:36] <StevenCodes22> oh hell naw sorry I said help not rewrite all of this
[20:47:59] <shoky> why are you running that same block of code.. twice?
[20:48:09] <shoky> in the 'else'
[20:48:30] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/9se
[20:48:32] <awc737> only 3 actually
[20:48:42] <shoky> ??
[20:48:56] <awc737> i'm not, one goes on custnum, one goes on cust name
[20:49:02] <awc737> yeah i could reference both at once lol
[20:49:15] <shoky> oh, looked like same id
[20:49:19] <awc737> ya
[20:49:38] <jacobroufa> awc737: why not build a function that does that and changes which id to output based on what you feed it?
[20:49:40] <jacobroufa> less code
[20:49:54] <shoky> yea, stay DRY
[20:50:03] <awc737> so originally when this was not working async, i had like 5 different paste recommendations, and one of them was like this
[20:50:14] <StevenCodes22> jacobroufa, Boom...
[20:50:19] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/9qX
[20:50:35] <StevenCodes22> wtf
[20:50:47] <awc737> is that much different than the way i'm doing it? with defferred? can I do it like that with callbacks
[20:51:26] <shoky> it'll be with callbacks either way :\
[20:51:32] <jacobroufa> awc737: ajax uses deferreds internally
[20:52:12] <awc737> like you said jacobroufa, i'll be creating a function to feed the id's and error message probably, regardless
[20:52:25] <awc737> but i'd still like that assigning in one place, becuase i'm going to keep adding many rules
[20:52:29] <awc737> some may use ajax some not
[20:53:18] <awc737> so the way this looks kinda makes sense, http://paste.laravel.com/9qX, but I'm not sure if its better or worse than what I have
[20:53:20] <shoky> anyway.. you have 2 different validations, one client-side and the other server-side
[20:53:32] <awc737> yeah
[20:53:34] <shoky> it makes sense for the code that handles each on the client to be.. seperate
[20:53:52] <shoky> but if you use functions and dont repeat yourself so much, it won't seem as "seperate"
[20:54:10] <awc737> are you saying i should not have this ajax call?
[20:54:19] <shoky> cause most of the work will be done in that "shared" function or whatever.
[20:54:26] <shoky> no thats not what im saying..
[20:55:05] <shoky> i'm basically saying don't repeat yourself
[20:55:43] <jacobroufa> shoky: like what youre doing now?
[20:55:45] <awc737> ok your right, i will definitely create that seperate function
[20:55:48] <jacobroufa> rofl
[20:56:08] * jacobroufa giggles at his own cleverness
[20:56:17] <awc737> but it still seems more concise to have the single validate(this).done(function up top
[20:56:18] <shoky> still?
[20:56:18] <jacobroufa> and now its officially past my bedtime
[20:56:21] <awc737> and the rules underneath
[20:56:21] <jacobroufa> this noob is tired
[20:56:42] <shoky> awc737: concise... maybe. logical? no
[20:56:54] <StevenCodes22> Having a girl everyone!!!!!!!!!!
[20:56:58] <jacobroufa> awc737: make it readable and dry, the rest will sort itself out
[20:57:00] <StevenCodes22> Woop Woop!
[20:57:00] <shoky> awc737: because the stuff inside .done(...  happens after the server respons
[20:57:03] <jacobroufa> good luck! :)
[20:57:10] <awc737> shoky, this is not more logical than what I had? http://paste.laravel.com/9qX
[20:57:21] <shoky> what you had was logical..
[20:57:23] <jacobroufa> StevenCodes22: congrats! my wife and i found out we were having a girl just a couple weeks ago!
[20:57:45] <awc737> especially if I take each of those .error-form and .invalid appending blocks and seperate them into a function?
[20:58:31] <StevenCodes22> jacobroufa, Congratulations as well i'm glad at least it was with a girl I love but pissed it was sos soon
[20:58:50] <shoky> awc737: yes that's a good way to go too, if it makes sense for you
[20:59:20] <awc737> shoky, is declaring var form = this; not important with that method?
[20:59:34] <awc737> because I was told I would need to declare form for some reason I forget
[21:00:09] <shoky> awc737: no, because there is already the local argument 'form', and 'this' is passed as that argument in the call to validate(..)
[21:00:19] <StevenCodes22> shoky, mind giving me your thoughts on a site i'm working on ?
[21:00:23] <jacobroufa> StevenCodes22: life happens. one foot in front of the other, remember to breath, and do what you love to the best of your ability. everything else is cake. :)
[21:00:37] <jacobroufa> StevenCodes22: congrats to your better half as well :)
[21:00:40] <jacobroufa> gnight all!
[21:00:42] <shoky> StevenCodes22: nope
[21:00:49] <StevenCodes22> jacobroufa,  Have a good on :)
[21:01:10] <StevenCodes22> shoky, http://stevencodes.herobo.com/Blog/index.php
[21:01:28] <gnarf> awc737: http://paste.laravel.com/9sp
[21:02:15] <gnarf> forgot the callback( false ) in the bad case: http://paste.laravel.com/9sq
[21:02:28] <gnarf> prolly should have used some jQuery instead of $'s too
[21:02:29] <gnarf> but whatever
[21:02:42] <awc737> woah
[21:02:49] <gnarf> if you ever feel yourself hitting "copy" and planning on pasting somewhere in your code - take the time to abstract
[21:03:17] <awc737> :) good advice
[21:03:34] <awc737> thanks a lot for doing that gnarf
[21:04:43] <shoky> StevenCodes22: looks like a blog :P anything specific you want feedback on?
[21:05:04] <StevenCodes22> shoky,  Theme please
[21:05:38] <shoky> it's nice
[21:05:54] <awc737> i think it looks clean
[21:05:58] <awc737> i don't know if i like the wood though
[21:06:03] <shoky> except the orange bar.. something about it is too.. blocky
[21:06:04] <StevenCodes22> Thanks didn't know if it was realy coming together
[21:06:17] <awc737> maybe i do
[21:06:28] <StevenCodes22> hmm maybe so
[21:07:00] <awc737> box-sizing: border-box; on that orange bar please lol
[21:07:10] <beachandbytes> slightly too much header space before content and too much wasted space on sides
[21:07:21] <awc737> the 1px is bothering my ocd
[21:07:54] <shoky> i'd go with a border-radius: 3px on the orange bar. but that's just me ;P
[21:08:54] <StevenCodes22> Yeah i'm feeling the roundness will help probably not gonna post update tonight
[21:09:03] <StevenCodes22> but you guys are helping it clean itself :)P
[21:09:24] <awc737> yeah and maybe font-weight:bold and letter-spacing:1px on the menu font
[21:35:09] <skypce> hello
[21:35:19] <skypce> can you helpme with jquery simple window resiz
[21:35:27] <skypce> window resize
[21:50:50] <awc737> is jquery.deferred rejected by default
[22:02:52] <awc737> whats the difference between pending and rejected
[22:03:43] <awc737> or at least, as far as this is concerned
[22:03:51] <awc737> validate(form).done(function() { form.submit(); });
[22:04:36] <awc737> whether it is pending or whether I explicitly deferred.reject() it, it does what I need
[22:25:44] <skypce> hello
[22:26:05] <beachandbytes> hi
[22:30:45] <skypce> beachandbytes,
