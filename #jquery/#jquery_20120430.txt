[00:16:20] <Akuma> hello, I'm using a selector like this $('div[class^=myclass]').click(function(){ $(this+':parent .otherclass').toggle();}); and I'd like for only the clicked item and ob to reac as opposed to
[00:16:23] <Akuma> oops
[00:16:33] <Akuma> disregard my request
[00:16:45] <Akuma> wrong keyboard
[00:29:43] <vigneshmoha> can any one help me to do page transition for fixed layout?
[00:50:59] <EdwardIII> hey, i've got a modal dialog (not jquery ui), and it's setup so that when you click the gray area outside the modal it closes it
[00:51:25] <EdwardIII> now, i've got e.preventPropagation() on the window itself so that the visitor can click inside the window. seems to work in chrome but not in IE or firefox?
[00:54:48] <EdwardIII> hrm weird-ass, think i figured it out
[00:55:02] <EdwardIII> something to do with an implicit 'event' variable existing in chrome but not in ie/ff
[00:57:11] <Zhy> What's the solution to that now? you use event instead of e ?
[00:57:18] <Zhy> I'm just curious :)
[00:58:43] <EdwardIII> Zhy: other way around, i'd actually made a typo so code looked like $('.mything').click(function(e){ event.stopPropagation() }
[00:59:05] <Zhy> ahh okay ^^ thanks EdwardIII
[00:59:12] <EdwardIII> Zhy: but i didn't spot it strait away because the code was just working just fine in chrome

[01:52:54] <mbrochh> hmm .. .find, I guess
[01:53:14] <EdwardIII> mbrochh: find would be dandy
[01:53:27] <mbrochh> and it works, thanks :)

[01:59:03] <Noeble> question: I have a mail going out after reqistration on my django site. The mail contains some dynamic information. I do this by creating a string in pything containing the variables needed. It works fine. However, how can I solve a situation with multiple languages in a good way?
[01:59:08] <EdwardIII> hah i just got the most awesomeest error ever: HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: DOM Exception 3

[02:00:02] <nFFF> replace isnt a jQuery method as per the error
[02:00:16] <nFFF> its a native method

[02:05:22] <nFFF> to be honest your code seems strange
[02:09:00] <EdwardIII> i can simplify: http://jsfiddle.net/aZdNK/2/
[02:09:20] <EdwardIII> hrm, and if i simplify it stops the error
[02:09:22] * EdwardIII ponders
[02:09:58] <EdwardIII> nFFF: basically i'm trying to wrap all the images inside in a <a href...
[02:11:42] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/aZdNK/3/
[02:12:08] <EdwardIII> whoa
[02:12:49] <EdwardIII> nFFF: i wasn't aware about wrap()
[02:12:54] <nFFF> :>
[02:13:15] <EdwardIII> nFFF: thanks!
[02:13:24] <nFFF> literally think about the adjective that describes what you want to do, and guarunteed its a jquery method :D
[02:15:17] <Whirl3d> do I have to convert my jquery object into an actual array to remove items from the stack one by one?
[02:15:39] <Zackington> yes. yes you do.
[02:15:50] <Whirl3d> while (arr.length) { item=array.pop(); if (item) {do stuff}}
[02:16:11] <Whirl3d> so, unlike .add, there's not .subtract or something
[02:22:40] <ravenzz> Whirl3d not
[02:23:06] <Dr-Bombay> that's not strictly true, there's .slice but it will waste memory
[02:23:33] <ravenzz> I meant th jquery not()
[02:24:50] <Dr-Bombay> yeah, that too. also wastes memory
[02:26:13] <ravenzz> well that could be relatively important
[02:27:57] <Dr-Bombay> assembling a query object one by one is generally a bad idea imo
[02:28:08] <voidsheep> I'm trying to write a script that tries to find the image the user intended to click by presenting all background-images and images that could be under the cursor when the click happened. I thought I'd always present the first candidate and then apply pointer-event: none to the clicked element, but is there a way I can re-trigger the click so I could find the next element?
[02:28:08] <ravenzz> it is
[02:28:16] <ravenzz> imo too
[02:28:31] <ravenzz> but you could need to do that..
[02:28:34] <nFFF> .splice would work
[02:28:47] <nFFF> @ Whirl3d
[02:28:55] <Dr-Bombay> nfff: welcome to 10 minutes ago
[02:28:58] <ravenzz> Dr-Bombay could filter() be of any help?
[02:29:12] <Dr-Bombay> ravenzz: to remove just one element at a time? probably not
[02:29:22] <nFFF> Dr-Bombay, sorry where was splice suggested?
[02:29:24] <ravenzz> to remove a set of elements
[02:29:39] <Dr-Bombay> nfff: yeah ok
[02:29:50] <ravenzz> is quite rare that you want to remove just one element
[02:29:54] <nFFF> slice will construct a new set of elements
[02:29:59] <nFFF> splice will edit the current set
[02:30:55] <Dr-Bombay> nfff: they will both push the previous query state if I read the documentation correctly
[02:31:13] <Whirl3d> I'll show you what I am doing. THanks for all the input guys. here is half of the fiddle. I'll write comments. brb
[02:31:50] <ravenzz> uhm splice seems very good
[02:32:01] <ShishKabab> Does anyone know of a nice JS library I can use to manipulate urls? I have a url like /test/#test=foo and I need to insert a query parameter, like /test/?bar=baz#test=foo .
[02:32:03] <EdwardIII> splicing is awesome
[02:32:29] <ravenzz> I haven't heard about it before (maybe because I don't do js daily)
[02:32:30] <EdwardIII> ShishKabab: this may not be helpful but backbone.js has a whole routing library
[02:32:39] <EdwardIII> ravenzz: the concept exists in the majority of languages
[02:33:22] <ravenzz> I see
[02:33:47] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/RtuWg/43/
[02:33:52] <voidsheep> nvm my question, elementFromPoint seems to solve it
[02:34:07] <ShishKabab> EdwardIII: Thanks, but that's not really what I'm looking for.
[02:34:45] <Whirl3d> right now, I am using a local named function to parse through the collection using .next(). I would normally just .pop() each next item from the array and animate it. When the array was empty, move on...
[02:34:45] <Dr-Bombay> shish: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6644654/parse-url-with-jquery-javascript
[02:35:25] <nFFF> Whirl3d, cant you use .each() ?
[02:35:34] <nFFF> (havent read your code though)
[02:36:24] <Whirl3d> no, because I am doing it serially rather than parallel, .each would require some delay kludge ro something
[02:36:31] <Whirl3d> *or
[02:36:40] <Altreus> why when I set $(this).css({ opacity: someval }) does it also set position: relative, top: 0 and left: 0 on the element?
[02:36:49] <Altreus> er
[02:36:55] <Altreus> hang on that might have been a stupid question
[02:37:22] <Altreus> never mind -_-
[02:37:31] * Altreus discovered a .offset()
[02:37:31] <ShishKabab> Dr-Bombay: Hah, that's a cool hack. I also just found http://code.google.com/p/jsuri/ .
[02:37:50] <Dr-Bombay> whirled: if your goal is to queue up the same action on several elements, an array of elements is one way to keep track of where you are in the process
[02:38:22] <nFFF> or ?queue
[02:38:32] <nFFF> ?queue
[02:38:38] <Dr-Bombay> shish: it's not my idea, I just did a search
[02:38:41] <beancurd> que?
[02:38:42] <nFFF> :|
[02:39:03] <nFFF> ?qeueeeee
[02:39:10] <nFFF> how do you spell it? :<
[02:39:17] <xec_> nFFF: bot-t is offline ;)
[02:39:27] <nFFF> ahh :D
[02:39:28] <Whirl3d> Yeah. I tried using .when() earlier,  and then I tried to wrap my head around .pipe, but finally just resorted to what I felt familiar with..
[02:40:14] <Whirl3d> I am just repeating some old preloading code rattling around in my head from years back.
[02:40:45] <Dr-Bombay> whirl3d: in other words, you would register a completion function that pops an element off the array, starts animating the next one with the same completion function, until the array is empty
[02:41:57] <Whirl3d> Yeah, kinda like I did in my fiddle with hideNext
[02:42:22] <Whirl3d> except I had to improvise and use .next() rather than .pop
[02:42:36] <Whirl3d> <--havent' tried it yet, either
[02:44:41] <EdwardIII> huh, .pipe() - awesome
[02:44:52] <EdwardIII> never knew that was there either
[02:45:36] <Whirl3d> when you are animating an element from active to inactive states (where active is opacity:1  and inactive is both display:none and opacity:0) how do you avoid the problem if an element is "fading out" for example and then you tell it to stop and fade in?
[02:45:44] <EdwardIII> that would have solved a problem i was having a couple of days ago
[02:46:29] <Whirl3d> I'm not talking about simple fadein meethods, since my "enter" and "exit" methods are multipart and complex. How do I avoid resetting all my props inappropriately if I'm mid animation whe n the state changes
[02:46:54] <EdwardIII> hrm, this is only operating on #picker-3, any hints on whether the problem is in my code or the underlying ColorPicker code? i can paste that too: https://gist.github.com/2556915
[02:48:19] <EdwardIII> line #15 is the one i'm interested in
[02:54:04] <Dr-Bombay> whirl3d it looks like you can use .dequeue to discard a pending animation and force the next one to start
[03:05:33] <nFFF> Whirl3d, do you know how long you want the animation to take? :>
[03:06:09] <nFFF> if its consistant the easiest way is to just use a setimout :D
[03:06:58] <Whirl3d> nFFF, it's different (possibly) for every slide. Depends on how much junk is in it
[03:11:58] <ravenzz> uhm do you know any good plugin to do this two lists of value, the left one with all the available values and the right one with the choosen ones?
[03:15:17] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/RtuWg/49/ -- nothing. LOL
[03:16:14] <Dr-Bombay> ravenzz: it's not hard to roll your own
[03:16:31] <ravenzz> uhm of course
[03:16:38] <Whirl3d> I wish someone would make a simple timeline animation GUI for html5 with a jquery fallback..
[03:16:57] <ravenzz> I only wonder what could be the markup? a bunch of checkboxes?
[03:18:11] <Whirl3d> ravenzz, perhaps you could implement draggable and droppable. Then it would a bunch of links and you'd drag from the available to the "selected" box
[03:18:33] <ravenzz> links?
[03:18:44] <ravenzz> no way it is a form indeed
[03:18:53] <ravenzz> it should work without js
[03:18:56] <Whirl3d> so, select options
[03:19:14] <ravenzz> you can pick only one value with selects
[03:20:16] <ravenzz> I don't care about the drag and drop, i could add the elements with an Add button. I'd probably do drag and drop only to make it fancy
[03:20:26] <Whirl3d> are you looking for a jquery solution with a backup for html-no js
[03:26:03] <shoky> selects can be multiple choice..
[03:27:06] <ravenzz> multiple choices selects, silly me
[03:27:08] <ravenzz> yep
[03:28:32] <shoky> but i dont know how you plan on changing the options dynamically with no js
[03:28:59] <ravenzz> without any js I will have only the select
[03:29:32] <shoky> oki
[03:40:35] <vl1234> hi hi
[03:41:01] <vl1234> how to remove space in between 2 string in jquery
[03:41:22] <vl1234> in example "In Progress"
[03:44:27] <Christer> How can i make jquery "submit" a value to the current page and refresh the page by pressing a link. (So that it looks like a form submitted)
[03:45:52] <xec_> Christer: this functionality sounds an awful lot like you're reinventing the <a> element
[03:46:16] * Logikos agrees with xec_
[03:46:19] <Christer> Yeah, but i want this in a $_POST
[03:46:28] <Christer> not in a getter.
[03:47:12] <wltoriginal> hi all. Im a newbie and was wondering: is there a convenient walkthrough of the jquery source?
[03:47:18] <Logikos> then reinveting the submit button?
[03:47:40] <Christer> i dont want it to look like a button.
[03:47:44] <Logikos> if you want all of the actual steps involved in clicking a submit button ... why not just have them click a submit button?
[03:47:49] <Christer> i want it to be in the form of a link :P
[03:48:35] <xec_> Christer: any particular reason you want this functionality?
[03:48:59] <SPYGAME> how do i dynamically set the accept: property in jquery ui droppable ?
[03:49:08] <Christer> Yes, the a href makes a small icon be the actuall linker.
[03:49:39] <xec_> Christer: what?
[03:50:21] <SPYGAME> i tried using a simple variable whose value changes on different conditions but it doesn't seem to work :/
[03:50:22] <xec_> Christer: i mean, it is of course possible, it just sounds like an attempt at doing something normally very easy in a difficult way
[03:50:31] <Christer> sec.
[03:50:36] <Christer> ?? pastebin
[03:50:39] <Christer> damn
[03:50:40] <Christer> sec
[03:50:45] <xec_> Christer: try jsfiddle.net
[03:51:57] <Christer> http://pastebin.com/k98Ffp9W
[03:53:36] <Christer> i want the span image to act like a submit button.
[03:53:40] <xec_> Christer: this looks like PHP
[03:54:08] <Christer> it is PHP - but what im asking for is jquery functionality
[03:54:18] <xec_> Christer: jQuery is not going to care about your PHP - it can be useful to see your generated HTML though
[03:54:38] <Christer> aha
[03:54:39] <Christer> sec
[03:55:07] <Christer> and yes, iknow jquery doesnt care about php. i just tought you would have some understanding of what it prints.
[03:57:21] <Christer> xec_: http://jsfiddle.net/jVYsP/
[03:57:41] <Christer> But it doesnt show the key point tho -.- look like it doesnt include the jquery ui correctly
[03:58:02] <xec_> there is also no javascript in the javacsript file
[03:58:09] <xec_> s/file/field
[03:58:25] <xec_> and the html is invalid
[03:58:31] <Christer> Thats what im asking for ! lol :P
[03:58:59] <xec_> what do you mean "doesn't include jquery ui correctly" then
[03:59:14] <Christer> Take a look at the HTML
[03:59:52] <Christer> <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-circle-arrow-e"></span> :: This should be a an arrow from the jQuery UI icon set
[04:00:15] <Christer> That part is working..
[04:00:28] <Christer> and as you can see. im making the arrow act as a link.
[04:00:39] <NodeX> what does firebug say
[04:01:17] <Christer> now, i want the link to ask as an submit button.
[04:01:22] <Christer> act *
[04:02:24] <xec_> Christer: you were missing the jquery ui css, added it for you http://jsfiddle.net/jVYsP/1/
[04:02:53] <Christer> Thank u.
[04:03:05] <Christer> and why is the html invalid?
[04:03:12] <xec_> i fixed it
[04:03:33] <xec_> you can't have <center> as a child of <table>
[04:03:39] <xec_> preferably not at all
[04:04:40] <Christer> You can, and it works. but i agree! that shouldnt have been there.
[04:05:14] <xec_> no, you can't, if you want valid html
[04:05:16] <Christer> but back to the issue itself - how to make the arrow act as a submit button.
[04:06:01] <xec_> i still don't know why you can't just use the already existing a href
[04:06:38] <Christer> because i dont want the user to trigger a index.php?some_stupid_delete_action=13
[04:07:24] <Christer> by selecting the url from logs or something
[04:08:19] <Christer> therefor i want this to go as $_POST data instead.
[04:08:52] <xec_> okay, sure. if your button is an image you can use a form more easily than hacking it together with javascript
[04:08:58] <ravenzz> does data() works on elements that are not have been appended to the DOM yet?
[04:10:03] <xec_> (this might exclude the use of css sprites though)
[04:10:52] <Articate> I'm making a drop-down, and I'm wanting to use jQuery to show and hide it. Showing it is easy, but how can I make sure the drop-down closes whenever I click anything else?
[04:11:52] <Christer> xec_: what do you meen?
[04:12:18] <Christer> if i try to use it as a class of type=submit - then it just looks stupid.
[04:14:14] <xec_> Christer: http://jsfiddle.net/jVYsP/3/
[04:14:14] <`poo> poo
[04:14:26] <xec_> `poo: deep
[04:14:32] <`poo> thanks
[04:15:44] <xec_> Christer: this will work even if your user has disabled javascript = win!
[04:16:10] <ruby_on_tails> i am repeatedly removing an iframe on the webpage and appending it back with new content inside, and i guess its leading to a memory leak, does anyone know if i am right or wrong ? i read about this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/641666/does-this-jquery-code-snippet-cause-any-memory-leak but this seems to be pretty old and should be fixed by now ?
[04:18:11] <xec_> ruby_on_tails: maybe just change its contents rather than removing and appending the entire iframe over and over?
[04:21:28] <Christer> xec_: http://jsfiddle.net/jVYsP/4/ - this is more like it . but thanks for the direction. any idea on how to get the border away. seems like style="border: none;" doesnt work.
[04:21:37] <Articate> really. It's easy to do $("#id").click(), but I can't do a sort of $("!#id").click()
[04:23:39] <ruby_on_tails> so it seems like the DOM never gets rid of nodes, even if i apply remove() to them ?
[04:23:43] <xec_> Articate: well, there is :not(#id) - but then you would attach to *every* element on the page except that one
[04:24:13] <xec_> Articate: which is a horrible idea ;)
[04:24:24] <Articate> exactly.
[04:24:40] <xec_> what exactly are you doing?
[04:24:55] <xec_> Christer: i don't see a border? (ff)
[04:25:19] <Articate> I'm trying to show a drop-down when I click on an element, and hide it when it loses focus
[04:25:34] <Christer> lol, wtf, why would chrome do such a thing.. stupid browser.
[04:26:01] <xec_> Articate: well, there is the blur event
[04:26:40] <Articate> thanks :)
[04:27:28] <xec_> not sure if that will work on any element though
[04:27:30] <FND> hi - it appears `animate` doesn't work on BODY; is this a known limitation? (I couldn't find anything in the docs)
[04:27:40] <Articate> I'll give it a whirl
[04:27:45] <xec_> only used it with forms (assumed your dropdown was a <select>)
[04:28:45] <Articate> now they're divs and spans - didn't know if or how you can override the default functionality of <select>
[04:29:01] <Articate> it's a "drop up" rather than a drop down, which is why I'm going through a bit of a hassle
[04:29:55] <xec_> FND: what propert(y|ies) are you animating?
[04:30:17] <FND> xec_: $(document.body).animate("margin-left", "200px"); // nothing happens
[04:30:19] <Christer> xec_: are you sure that there is no easy way of just doing like this.. http://jsfiddle.net/jVYsP/6/ (look at the JS part, just a "markup" of what im trying to do)
[04:30:43] <xec_> FND: try padding
[04:31:12] <FND> xec_: same result - also for border (though I'm not sure that's animate-able)
[04:31:31] <FND> it works if I use `css` instead of `animate`
[04:31:37] <FND> (also for margin)
[04:33:15] <xec_> oh, your syntax is off i think
[04:33:30] <xec_> .animate({ marginLeft: -200 })
[04:33:52] <xec_> sorry, .animate({ marginLeft: 200 })
[04:34:43] <FND> I've tried that too
[04:34:51] <FND> but lemme make sure again
[04:35:23] <FND> oh wow
[04:35:36] <FND> xec_: you were right - I was positive I'd tried {} syntax
[04:35:40] * FND hits himself
[04:35:48] <FND> mea culpa, and thanks!
[04:35:50] <xec_> :)
[04:38:29] <xec_> Christer: i still think it's a mistake to use javascript where none is needed
[04:38:33] <Christer> oh and btw, im trying to prevent including 1000 forms on a page where i just want the ID of the thing the user clicks on to be submitted.
[04:39:12] <xec_> well, it is inside a php loop so you only have to code it once, right?
[04:40:31] <Christer> True, but isnt that unnessesary loading ? like litterally 1000 form fields where each has 2 lines it it.
[04:41:02] <shwaiil> hi
[04:41:03] <xec_> better than unnecessary javascript imo
[04:42:05] <Christer> hmm ok.
[04:44:37] <shwaiil> Q: In keyDown I'm moving a menu horizontaly. It works with setTimeout and when keyUp I clear the Timeout. The main function is recursive. The problem is that, this is not smooth and I'm out of ideas on doing this better. I dont have a jsfiddle example, but I do have the code that can be easily read. http://pastebin.ca/2142196
[04:44:45] <shwaiil> any tip would be appreciated on how to do this better and smooth
[04:45:38] <xec_> Christer: then, when you got it working without javascript, you can enhance it with ajax, for instance make a php file exclusively for deleting posts and have it return true on success and false if it failed
[04:46:30] <xec_> Christer: then intercept the submit event on the form and do a $.post(), in the callback you can remove the table row(s)
[04:47:33] <xec_> add some cool animation and you got yourself a web 2.0 ajax enhanced(tm) page
[04:47:39] <Christer> Well, that was just a given example..
[04:47:58] <Christer> for why i didnt want the Get
[04:48:02] <Christer> method..
[04:48:20] <xec_> yeah, with $.post() you don't touch the url at all
[04:48:43] <xec_> which brings me back to the starting point
[04:48:47] <Christer> What it does is that it submits the ID of a movie - and then  populates all the fields and allows the user to edit and submit the fields again..
[04:49:36] <xec_> Christer: now we're getting somewhere!
[04:49:37] <Christer> And to be able to do this with javascript i would have to implement a whole lot of XML data to get the current values and then again execute another script to get the values
[04:49:38] <xec_> :D
[04:49:58] <Christer> with javascript and ajax i meen.. *
[04:50:24] <Christer> so instead i wanted to just make the page refresh, with a submitted value for some ID i can use for printing the info with PHP instead
[04:50:28] <xec_> i assume your php is generating form html, right?
[04:50:53] <xec_> when the id is posted
[04:51:02] <Christer> yeah for the form that we have discussed :)
[04:51:09] <Christer> ah yeah.
[04:51:09] <xec_> yes good
[04:51:36] <xec_> you can get that with .load()
[04:51:50] <Christer> what can i get with .load?
[04:51:59] <recentlydeceased> hey peeps, just using the jquery version of spin.js  and can't seem to get it to stop, any ideas?
[04:52:02] <xec_> the filled out form
[04:52:18] <recentlydeceased> $('#foo').spin(opts) starts it
[04:52:23] <Christer> You got to be kidding me!
[04:52:26] <xec_> Christer: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[04:53:04] <xec_> Christer: especially the part about page fragments
[04:53:14] <Christer> yeah im reading like crazy now.
[04:53:34] <xec_> since you don't want to insert a complete page in the middle of your table or something crazy
[04:54:41] <xec_> recentlydeceased: do you have an url to the docs for this spin.js you speak of?
[04:55:01] <recentlydeceased> http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/#!
[04:55:06] <Christer> so basicly i can submit with ajax. print the form and everything with PHP in that file. and then use .load to get that content into the site?
[04:55:24] <recentlydeceased> from what I can gather just making the same call should stop it, but it doesn't
[04:55:49] <recentlydeceased> xec, jquery section is near the botto
[04:55:50] <recentlydeceased> m
[04:55:53] <xec_> recentlydeceased: look at the example at http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/#jquery
[04:56:13] <xec_> it includes a method call to spinner.stop()
[04:57:16] <recentlydeceased> yeah, is it not the same call?
[04:58:27] <xec_> hold on
[04:58:37] <recentlydeceased> xec, forgive me, but how would you stop it then? syntax wise?
[04:58:38] <recentlydeceased> ok
[05:00:05] <recentlydeceased> the way I read the code was that by calling $('#foo').spin(opts) you create a new data.spinner and if ti gets called again then it would stop and remove data.spinner?
[05:00:28] <xec_> yeah looks like it
[05:02:39] <recentlydeceased> huh, just went through to the 'advanced' third party site and there is a comment in the code ... $(this).spin(false)
[05:02:50] <recentlydeceased> xec, spin(false) works... ;)
[05:03:03] <recentlydeceased> xec, thanks for your time
[05:03:08] <xec_> http://jsfiddle.net/MedB8/
[05:03:13] <xec_> .stop() works too
[05:05:01] <recentlydeceased> xec, awesome thank you
[05:05:50] <xec_> recentlydeceased: you could also stop it with a second call if you change the plugin code (change if opts == false with an else clause) http://jsfiddle.net/MedB8/1/
[05:06:36] <xec_> but i think it makes more sense with the .spin(false) thing and keep it like it is ;)
[05:06:48] <recentlydeceased> xec_, you're too kind!
[05:06:52] <recentlydeceased> thanks again!

[05:15:42] <wolfehr> hi guys, I've added in an element as an html fragment using jquery, when this element is clicked, I need to trigger an event. I've used $('.myClass').on("click",function(event){} but this doesn't seem to work for elements added as html fragments after page load?
[05:16:12] <wolfehr> live still works, but it says that live is now deprecated
[05:16:35] <quicksilver> if you read the documentation for on it should be clear
[05:16:39] <wolfehr> my fault, wrong syntax
[05:16:44] <quicksilver> there is a section which eplxains how to convert live to on, isn't there
[05:16:45] <quicksilver> cool :)
[05:17:58] <NodeX> wolfehr : the on() syntax differs alot from live()
[05:18:10] <NodeX> it threw me for ages and took a while to get used to
[05:18:27] <quicksilver> it's not just the syntax that differs!
[05:18:29] <quicksilver> the meaning differs.
[05:18:39] <quicksilver> you have to decide which element to use to delegate the handlers on
[05:18:50] <quicksilver> one you see what it's doing, the syntax makes sense.
[05:19:00] <NodeX> $(".class").live('click',foo) == $("body").on('click','.class',foo);
[05:19:02] <wolfehr> yeah, seems like you can be more specific whereas before you were just applying to the whole document with no specificness
[05:19:27] <wolfehr> (specificness being a word for this sentence only)
[05:19:30] <pachet> .on for delegation is alright
[05:19:36] <NodeX> Personaly I always used context with live() so it wasn't an issue for me
[05:19:48] <pachet> i still think its possible to bind to the necessary elements when they're added, in nearly all cases
[05:20:17] <NodeX> hopefuly one day we'll see a new element bind() live livequery in the core
[05:20:58] <NodeX> live livequery -> like livequery
[05:24:40] <objNoob> I have some code here that I took out of the annon function for event and put into named function
[05:24:50] <objNoob> however my ajax request is failing to fire now

[05:30:37] <objNoob> i'm lame. i somehow had the wrong debug tab selected in my dev tools
[05:30:58] <objNoob> so the ajax was firing all along.. but not appearing because i was in the wrong tab :(
[05:38:39] <Ring0`> Hey. I have http://pastebin.com/Exjqjfaa I would like to execute something after all 4 functions are done, how should I use .promise().done() in that way so it triggers when all 4 ajax requests are completed?
[05:38:47] <Ring0`> Since they may take various amount of time
[05:39:04] <Flo0815> does sombody know how i do page transitions with jQuery mobile?
[05:39:49] <toxz> hi! can anyone explain me this? http://jsfiddle.net/bS7J5/4/
[05:41:21] <ratty> Hi guys, anyone know why jcarousel is miscalculating scrollback distance here http://proteus.curvd.co.uk
[05:41:28] <pachet> toxz: i'd say that's fairly self-explanatory :[
[05:41:33] <ratty> I have removed all custom styles on first carousel
[05:41:47] <ratty> Drupal plugin by the way
[05:42:00] <ratty> every scrollback crops more of the carousel item..
[05:42:05] <toxz> pachet - i cant see why "this" depends on the style building the object... can you help me?
[05:42:17] <pachet> Flo0815: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[05:43:04] <Teduardo> Is there any best practice for what to do when the user clicks a submit button so they don't get bored and keep clicking it? Usually the requests process in less than a second, sometimes there is more time required
[05:44:11] <pachet> toxz: new is an operator that requires a function as its primary correlative
[05:44:14] <Teduardo> Should I pop a modal message that says, please wait? or show a little spinny animation?
[05:44:16] <pachet> ?g mdn new @ toxz
[05:44:17] <bot-t> toxz, new - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new
[05:45:12] <pachet> Teduardo: there's not a best practice - it depends on taste and circumstance
[05:45:40] <pachet> i usually grey out the button and set the button text from 'submit' to 'saving...' or something
[05:46:00] <bluesm> hi
[05:46:26] <bluesm> Can we combine $(#any_id)
[05:46:35] <bluesm> with DOM functions ?
[05:46:38] <Teduardo> pachet: is there a way that works with more browsers?
[05:47:07] <pachet> Teduardo: not really
[05:47:14] <toxz> pachet - thx ill take a look
[05:47:15] <pachet> bluesm: :[
[05:47:44] <pachet> bluesm: i think you're missing the point -- jquery is a dom abstraction lib, so that you dont have to worry about cross browser issues in calling the methods you mentioned
[05:47:52] <pachet> if you're just going to be calling those methods, why use jquery at all?
[05:48:17] <pachet> but to answer your question (again), you can access the actual dom element via $('#my_id').get(0).innerHTML, or similar
[05:49:43] <mansour> how do I get a child of an element using class selector ?
[05:50:08] <bluesm> Thanks :)
[05:50:23] <pachet> mansour: how do you mean
[05:50:34] <pachet> $('#foo').children('.bar')?
[05:50:41] <mansour> I have an element e, and I need ....
[05:50:45] <mansour> ok, perfect
[05:50:49] <mansour> all I need
[05:50:53] <mansour> thank you pachet
[05:51:44] <pachet> mansour: yw, most traversal methods work that way, allowing you to pass in an optional selector to filter by, eg $('#foo').parents('.bar')
[05:52:31] <mansour> coool.
[05:52:44] <Teduardo> pachet: do you know of an example that shows how to disable the submit button onclick?
[05:53:05] <wolfehr> e.preventDefault()
[05:53:06] <mansour> then I have to select the first element as in an array, I guess. Right ?
[05:53:53] <ravenzz> uhm how this code looks like? http://jsfiddle.net/n7BM6/ could it be improved?
[05:54:13] <pachet> mansour: that also depends on what method you're calling on the resulting object
[05:55:05] <mansour> pachet: thank you
[05:55:29] <tomasm-> hi, is there an easy way to detect whether a form is blank or partially filled out? I want to do different things if the form was never filled out - but it may involve some default values, I wasn't sure if there was a way to compare them vs altered values (though most fields are likely blank)
[05:56:14] <coldhead> Ring0`: http://jsfiddle.net/FZnpA/ #untested #butyougettheidea
[05:56:50] <pachet> Teduardo: if i'm using jquery to send form data via ajax, it's as easy as checking a flag in your submit callback, eg $('#mySubmitBtn').on('click.mynamespace', function(){if ( somenamespace.is_disabled ) return; /*do form submission here*/});
[05:57:41] <pachet> Teduardo: alternatively if you're applying a class to the element in order to grey it out or what not, you can just check whether that class is present
[05:57:54] <pachet> a little less robust, but works just fine in simple situations
[06:00:57] <Ring0`> coldhead: unfortunatelly this being triggered before ajax throw response
[06:01:39] <coldhead> Ring0`: it's firing the final function before it does any of the ajax?
[06:01:47] <Ring0`> yes
[06:01:51] <coldhead> hmm
[06:02:05] <coldhead> maybe $.post() returns something different to $.ajax()
[06:02:06] <Ring0`> i tried with .done also.
[06:02:23] <mansour> pachet: this is not working really,     var txt = $(id).find(".msg");
[06:02:24] <mansour>     txt.textContent = msg ;
[06:02:27] <NodeX> post is a wrapper for ajax
[06:02:48] <NodeX> the "a" in ajax means asynchronous too
[06:03:06] <Ring0`> Well. If you use $.post(blabla).then();
[06:03:10] <Ring0`> it works
[06:03:10] <ravenzz> how bad is this code? http://jsfiddle.net/rVQZz/
[06:03:22] <quicksilver> mansour: you probably meant $('#'+id)... ?
[06:03:45] <pachet> mansour: txt.text(msg)
[06:03:55] <nFFF> ravenzz, does it work?
[06:03:59] <mansour> no, it's selecting the correct element.
[06:04:00] <ravenzz> it does
[06:04:08] <mansour> I will try that
[06:04:10] <nFFF> thats all that matters :>
[06:04:12] <ravenzz> it converts a select into a UL
[06:04:14] <Ring0`> but if you use $.myfunc = function() { $.post(blabla); }  $.myfunc().done(); it will return that myfunc is not a function :/
[06:04:19] <ravenzz> nah
[06:04:29] <ravenzz> I'd like to write a good code
[06:04:56] <mansour> pachet: yes. txt.text(...), worked as expected. thank you
[06:05:01] <pachet> ravenzz: give me a second to look at what you wrote
[06:05:07] <ravenzz> ok
[06:05:08] <pachet> mansour: yw
[06:05:10] <ravenzz> thank you
[06:09:53] <ravenzz> pachet I basically going to convert a multiple select into 2 lists, the right one has all the available value and every time i select one it will be moved to the second box
[06:11:01] <ravenzz> if there is a plugin that already does this dirty job, i would like to know its name :)
[06:16:15] <theharshest> hi all
[06:18:34] <theharshest> can anyone tell me why this isn't working - http://pastebin.com/wETfrBgR
[06:18:51] <theharshest> this is my first hand at jquery, so excuse any silly mistakes
[06:19:51] <pifantastic> theharshest: http://jsfiddle.net/Takpm/
[06:19:54] <pifantastic> works for me
[06:20:08] <beancurd> theharshest: you haven't included jquery?
[06:20:09] <pifantastic> at least, it does what the code tells it to do
[06:20:22] <beancurd> also css.
[06:21:51] <theharshest> pifantastic - copy it to your machine and then try, it won't work I think. there its working I can see though.
[06:22:13] <pifantastic> theharshest: like beancurd said, are you including jquery?
[06:22:25] <pifantastic> theharshest: in your pastebin you don't
[06:22:28] <theharshest> beancurd - havent included jquery? if that's just a line, can you please tell?
[06:22:53] <pifantastic> theharshest: you have to actually download the jquery library and include it in your page
[06:22:56] <beancurd> <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[06:23:01] <pifantastic> or link to a copy on a CDN like that ^
[06:23:58] <beancurd> put that anywhere before your document ready script block
[06:24:50] <mansour> some times variable ar declared with $ preceding, and sometime not. For example, 	var $form = $(this),
[06:25:19] <mansour> why would the variable $form have '$' before it's name ?
[06:25:25] <monk12> Hey all, I have this 'Share' toolbar that I have to hook into. It opens a new window with Facebook/Twitter etc.... I need to present a popup before to alert user that they are going to get a new window/tab with the new site (mostly just to remind peeps our privacy policy doesn't apply on the new site), but it isn't working.... Here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/cSA2b/2/
[06:25:38] <beancurd> $ makes it a jquery var
[06:25:42] <mansour> I understand that we $('#someId'),
[06:25:49] <`poo> mansour it's a convention people sometimes use to differentiate between jquery objects and non-jquery objects
[06:26:14] <mansour> ok, I see. I will need to do some readings then.
[06:26:16] <mansour> thank you.
[06:26:33] <pachet> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/cQRrb/
[06:28:57] <theharshest> thanks all :)
[06:31:12] <monk12> I thought event.stopImmediatePropagation() would stop other handlers added from running on that hyperlink in my example, but guess its not working.
[06:38:53] <ravenzz> pachet cool thank you
[06:45:52] <pifantastic> monk12: http://jsfiddle.net/cSA2b/3/
[06:48:24] <monk12> pifantastic, thanks for taking a look. That updated code doesn't work in Firefox and IE for me. So you just replaced stopImmediatePropagation with stopPropagation, did that work in your browser? When I click Cancel it still goes there.
[06:51:00] <pifantastic> monk12: http://jsfiddle.net/cSA2b/5/ it appears to be the addthis script that is causing it to not work
[06:51:09] <beancurd> monk12, would a better, less intrusive solution be to reveal a hidden div with the disclaimer?
[06:51:43] <beancurd> then hide div on 'cancel' or 'hide div + goto url in new window' on confirm.
[06:52:26] <ignotus> hi, is it possible to filter for links (<a ...>...</a>) that don't have click handlers attached?

[07:09:21] <userfriendly> is someone in here using jqgrid? i can't figure out from the docs how to make a cell render a value when given a key, as opposed to having to give the cell the value directly

[07:23:49] <monk12> sorry had to leave for a meeting for a sec... pifantastic, yup. I need AddThis on this site unfortunately, so trying to do stuff before it does its default events it attaches... beancurd, I'd love to reveal a hidden div popup with a disclaimer (those are the orig requirements in fact)... But again you have to hook before AddThis's events, so still just as hard (confirm popup is just a test to see if can get it working).
[07:24:27] <thang> FinalAngel: try removing the quotes around cache
[07:24:29] <monk12> I might just stop using the toolbar at worst. Just thought I could attempt to get it working.

[07:28:17] <bot-t> vpv4oo, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

[07:28:42] <Teduardo> http://jsfiddle.net/Q9zmz/2/
[07:29:25] <vpv4oo> you know these pages where you load once, page has a main menu. on click: of the menu items only the content part of the page is loaded via jquery. header and menu stay there
[07:30:04] <vpv4oo> this is what i have, and on one subpage im trying to integrate google maps. no problem, if i import the google maps api in the main header
[07:30:19] <vpv4oo> but that would mean it loads for every subpage, even though only needed on one of them
[07:30:44] <vpv4oo> so i have tried using $.getScript() for the api, that is just not working
[07:31:41] <vpv4oo> so the question is: how would you dynamically load the google maps api on click of a menu item that loads page content, but does not reload the main header?
[07:32:38] <Woet> ?demo @ vpv4oo
[07:32:38] <bot-t> vpv4oo, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[07:45:54] <vpv4oo> o, somethings is missing. 1 sec

[07:52:06] <syn_y0> thang: when did you researched it?
[07:52:32] <vpv4oo> correct brackets, new version: http://pastebin.com/8XDJEiHP
[07:53:21] <shoky> Teduardo: that's fine
[07:56:00] <thang> syn_y0: like two months ago, but i was looking into ios safari. android may be more forgiving but from what i can tell, you can only add a handler to the onorientationchange event
[07:56:17] <thang> not prevent it
[07:59:17] <thang> syn_y0: i stumbled upon this while researching, but never tried it since it seemed hacky http://stackoverflow.com/a/7061983/1267390
[08:00:31] <jes> I have, $("#news_official a").click(function () { Now how do I access the id of the "a" I clicked?
[08:01:11] <shoky> jes: this.id
[08:01:32] <jes> undefined
[08:01:35] <syn_y0> thang: ok thx
[08:01:53] <xckpd7_> question: I'm appending an image to a div. Once I append it, it shows the alt tag, and then the actual image when it loads. Any simple way to get the image to load before it's inserted?
[08:01:59] <jes> oops.
[08:02:02] <jes> ty shoky
[08:02:11] <shoky> np

[08:08:23] <vpv4oo> why even ask me to create a demo if noone intends to look at it
[08:12:37] <raj> shoky, still wasn't able to figure out two things
[08:12:54] <raj> and goodmorning :)
[08:16:08] <jes> I have var someId = 'page1'; How do i access the element by id with name that someId stores. Like $("#"+someId).show() is this possible?
[08:18:35] <BackPacksGotJets> how can i get to index 35213 in firebug?   /ScriptResource.axd:5:35213)
[08:25:15] <waltercon> when using $(post)
[08:25:21] <shoky> raj i'll be with ya in ~45min
[08:25:22] <waltercon> how can u return false
[08:25:29] <shoky> and goodmorning ;)
[08:25:30] <waltercon> i mean i put it on a submit input
[08:25:36] <waltercon> i need to return false from it
[08:28:09] <itatitat> ey guys
[08:28:28] <itatitat> I need to acces to a son of a div when, for example, I made "hover"
[08:28:31] <itatitat> in the father
[08:28:39] <silverwind> waltercon, you never need to use false..
[08:29:02] <itatitat> I use jQuery(this div.son)....
[08:29:03] <NoiseEee> itatitat: so .find() the child
[08:29:05] <itatitat> but is not working
[08:29:11] <itatitat> oups
[08:29:23] <itatitat> not with selector?
[08:29:59] <NoiseEee> ?demo @ itatitat
[08:30:00] <bot-t> itatitat, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:30:00] <waltercon> silverwind: what do u mean
[08:30:11] <itatitat> ok
[08:30:27] <waltercon> i dont want the submit button to post
[08:30:31] <waltercon> i want to post with ajax
[08:31:26] <LukeNukem> waltercon, prevent default action on form submit and then do an ajax request
[08:31:28] <LukeNukem> simple as that
[08:32:12] <waltercon> lukenukem how do u do that
[08:32:53] <LukeNukem> waltercon, you are absolutely new to jquery?
[08:33:12] <waltercon> ya
[08:33:27] <waltercon> i mean how do u prevent default action
[08:34:39] <LukeNukem> waltercon, e.preventDefault();
[08:34:48] <silverwind> ^
[08:34:49] <LukeNukem> you must have a callback in the function named e
[08:35:04] <LukeNukem> function(e) <
[08:35:30] <itatitat> http://jsfiddle.net/gpbSp/
[08:35:34] <itatitat> here you go
[08:35:38] <silverwind> waltercon,  $('.lulz').on('submit', function(event) { e.preventDefault();  doWhateverYouWant(); });
[08:35:41] <silverwind> Err
[08:35:46] <silverwind> waltercon,  $('.lulz').on('submit', function(e) { e.preventDefault();  doWhateverYouWant(); });
[08:35:56] <itatitat> Is simple I think, but....I cant
[08:36:04] <LukeNukem> silverwind, first example should have event.preventDefault();
[08:36:28] <silverwind> LukeNukem, That's why I repeated the line... I'm fully aware I did a mistake.
[08:36:30] <waltercon> oh
[08:36:41] <rahmen> Hi! $.when.apply(null, deferredList).always(function () { ... } ); This works fine in FF but fires off too early in IE. I tried alerting stuff before resolving/rejecting the deferreds and then in the always function and in IE the alert box in the always function sometimes fires off before the others... anyone who knows how to handle this?
[08:37:12] <LukeNukem> you could also use return false; but meh
[08:37:33] <waltercon> how do u use return false?
[08:37:37] <itatitat> I only want to show the box
[08:37:45] <itatitat> inside, .makers
[08:37:47] <itatitat> but I cant
[08:38:23] <LukeNukem> waltercon, just use preventDefault
[08:38:30] <LukeNukem> return false is for different scenarios
[08:39:01] <LukeNukem> itatitat, whats the issue
[08:39:13] <rahmen> Adding to the above question: It's like IE is running the always function as soon as any deferred object has completed. Is this a bug?
[08:39:14] <waltercon> well the thing is
[08:39:25] <waltercon> i have these required field validators
[08:39:28] <itatitat> the problem is that...if I make hover in .post, I cant see the div inside, .markers
[08:39:33] <waltercon> they dont seem to work unless i submit
[08:39:36] <waltercon> but
[08:39:40] <itatitat> I cant change the property vsisibility
[08:39:46] <waltercon> i dont want to submit cause i want to do post
[08:39:51] <LukeNukem> waltercon, um
[08:39:52] <LukeNukem> wtf are you saying
[08:40:03] <LukeNukem> you are submitting the form but just preventing its default action and doing another action
[08:40:08] <waltercon> with ajax so i dont lose my values in case the form doesnt validate
[08:40:26] <waltercon> ok
[08:40:29] <brianlov_> LukeNukem: I think he's saying that he wants to take advantage of the serverside validation.
[08:40:41] <waltercon> ya
[08:40:45] <waltercon> thats what i am saying
[08:40:52] <LukeNukem> well you are doing a post request to a php file
[08:40:53] <brianlov_> LukeNukem: So the validation comes back and says "these fields suck" but by then the fields are wiped because the server is dumb and doesn't pass back the filled in values.
[08:40:57] <LukeNukem> and that will be taken care of by the php
[08:41:23] <waltercon> well its like this
[08:41:29] <brianloveswords> waltercon: The correct way to do this would be to duplicate your validation client side.
[08:41:34] <brianloveswords> waltercon: not to try to double-post.
[08:41:39] <LukeNukem> waltercon, in the ajax request in the success callback just make it display the content that is returned in an element
[08:41:44] <waltercon> im not trying to double post
[08:41:48] <LukeNukem> and in the php file, just echo the errors
[08:41:50] <waltercon> im trying to post with ajax
[08:42:02] <waltercon> but i also have required field validators
[08:42:09] <waltercon> that use css and for=
[08:42:14] <LukeNukem> brianloveswords, thats bad advise imo
[08:42:16] <waltercon> but that only works with submit
[08:42:22] <LukeNukem> dude
[08:42:24] <LukeNukem> submit is an EVENT
[08:42:26] <brianloveswords> LukeNukem: why is that bad advice?
[08:42:28] <LukeNukem> it has nothing to do with server side code
[08:42:35] <waltercon> i know
[08:42:50] <LukeNukem> brianloveswords, why duplicate forms
[08:42:54] <brianloveswords> Not forms, validation.
[08:42:54] <LukeNukem> this can be done in one single button click
[08:42:58] <waltercon> lukenukem how do i get my css required field validators to work if its not submit
[08:43:14] <LukeNukem> waltercon, dude, the server side script is php?
[08:43:14] <brianloveswords> It's a waste of an HTTP request.
[08:43:27] <waltercon> no its asp.net mvc
[08:43:37] <LukeNukem> -.-
[08:43:45] <LukeNukem> people code in jokes these days?
[08:43:56] <waltercon> huh
[08:43:59] <waltercon> anyways
[08:44:05] <LukeNukem> i was implying that asp.net is a joke ^_^
[08:44:14] <waltercon> this is asp.net mvc
[08:44:18] <waltercon> not webforms
[08:44:22] <LukeNukem> still a joke ^_^
[08:44:30] <jes> I have a page that listens for a clicks in a div, now when I generate the same page through ajax it for some reason doesn't respond to that listener. Any ideas why?
[08:44:45] <LukeNukem> jes, are you binding it to on or live?
[08:44:50] <waltercon> well im gonna try prevent default actio i guess
[08:44:55] <jes> live
[08:44:56] <LukeNukem> listen
[08:45:02] <LukeNukem> the logic is waltercon
[08:45:04] <waltercon> i mean will the required field validators still work
[08:45:11] <waltercon> if i do prevent default action?
[08:45:12] <LukeNukem> im going to tell you the logic
[08:45:34] <LukeNukem> First in a normal form, on submit it just takes you to the action page
[08:45:43] <LukeNukem> if its mycode.asp, it takes you to that
[08:45:49] <waltercon> i know all this
[08:45:52] <LukeNukem> now in ajax we are doing the same thing
[08:45:56] <waltercon> i know
[08:45:58] <LukeNukem> but we are not loading a new page
[08:46:06] <waltercon> ya
[08:46:09] <LukeNukem> so the server side things will happen as it is
[08:46:11] <LukeNukem> even validation
[08:46:14] <waltercon> ya
[08:46:16] <waltercon> but listen
[08:46:17] <LukeNukem> all you have to do is return the errors
[08:46:24] <LukeNukem> to the current page
[08:46:25] <LukeNukem> and display it
[08:46:27] <waltercon> i have 2 types of validation
[08:46:35] <LukeNukem> 2 types?
[08:46:39] <waltercon> i have required field validators
[08:46:41] <waltercon> that are css
[08:46:48] <waltercon> and server side validation
[08:46:57] <waltercon> that is done on server with ajax post
[08:47:00] <LukeNukem> css validators dafuq
[08:47:12] <waltercon> the css validators stop it from posting
[08:47:17] <waltercon> if it doesnt have a value
[08:47:21] <waltercon> in the textbox
[08:47:30] <itatitat> Hi guys
[08:47:33] <brianloveswords> Oh, you ALREADY have clientside validation. I think that's what he's saying by CSS validators.
[08:47:35] <itatitat> I've this code
[08:47:37] <waltercon> but that doesnt seem to work unless yhr input type is submit
[08:47:41] <itatitat> http://jsfiddle.net/gpbSp/
[08:47:45] <waltercon> ya
[08:47:46] <LukeNukem> waltercon, you have client side validation
[08:47:49] <LukeNukem> that checks if the forms are empty
[08:47:50] <itatitat> But I dont know why I cant change the property visibility
[08:47:52] <waltercon> ya
[08:47:52] <LukeNukem> fields*
[08:48:00] <LukeNukem> thats javascript i assume
[08:48:00] <waltercon> those only work if the input type is submit
[08:48:06] <waltercon> i dont think so
[08:48:10] <waltercon> i think its css
[08:48:15] <brianloveswords> That's impossible.
[08:48:16] <LukeNukem> css does not validate forms
[08:48:17] <LukeNukem> -_-
[08:48:22] <LukeNukem> waltercon, show me your code
[08:48:39] <waltercon> <span class="field-validation-valid" style="color: Red" data-valmsg-replace="true" data-valmsg-for="SFAttn"></span>
[08:48:45] <LukeNukem> DUUDE
[08:48:47] <LukeNukem> www.jsfiddle.net
[08:48:50] <syn_y0> http://tinyurl.com/d39wd4s im working on a mobile version for one of my websites. but i got problems with data-role="footer" it isnt at the correct position and when i add the  data-position="fixed" it completely hidden..
[08:48:56] <waltercon> it s<input id="SFAttn" class="required" type="text" value="" style="width: 220px;" name="SFAttn" maxlength="35">
[08:49:02] <waltercon> ok
[08:49:05] <LukeNukem> waltercon, post it on jsfiddle or some pastie site
[08:49:06] <LukeNukem> ^_^
[08:50:20] <waltercon> http://jsfiddle.net/ydZqQ/
[08:50:47] <itatitat> How can I select a son, when I start with $(this)?
[08:50:57] <waltercon> see where it says
[08:50:58] <waltercon> data-valmsg-for="SFAttn"
[08:51:04] <waltercon> what is that?
[08:51:05] <waltercon> css?
[08:51:18] <waltercon> cause it works if u put a submit input on it
[08:51:19] <LukeNukem> itatitat, select a son?
[08:51:28] <itatitat> mmmmmmmmm,
[08:51:31] <waltercon> it will show required
[08:51:36] <LukeNukem> waltercon, thats a data attribute ^_^
[08:51:38] <itatitat> the problem is that the father has an event
[08:51:45] <LukeNukem> PARENT
[08:51:45] <LukeNukem> and
[08:51:45] <LukeNukem> CHILD
[08:51:47] <LukeNukem> geez
[08:51:47] <itatitat> and with that event I want to acces to a son
[08:51:47] <waltercon> is that css?
[08:51:48] <LukeNukem> >_>
[08:51:51] <itatitat> but I dont know how
[08:51:56] <LukeNukem> waltercon, thats not css.
[08:52:06] <itatitat> I use $(this "something")
[08:52:08] <waltercon> how come it only works with submit input
[08:52:09] <itatitat> but is not working
[08:52:17] <LukeNukem> itatitat, thats now how you use $(this)
[08:52:19] <waltercon> well how can i make my button a submit input
[08:52:33] <itatitat> ?
[08:52:33] <waltercon> but not actually submit but use ajax
[08:52:35] <bot-t> itatitat, jQuery: The Write Less, Do More, JavaScript Library - http://jquery.com/
[08:52:40] <LukeNukem> itatitat, this refers to the current element you are on
[08:52:44] <itatitat> yes yes, IM using jquery
[08:52:46] <waltercon> so i can have 2 validators
[08:52:48] <itatitat> ok
[08:52:50] <waltercon> lukenukem
[08:52:51] <itatitat> yes, with the event
[08:52:53] <LukeNukem> waltercon, rewrite the validators in jquery
[08:52:53] <LukeNukem> its easy
[08:52:54] <itatitat> ok
[08:53:06] <LukeNukem> if($("#input").val() == "")){}
[08:53:07] <waltercon> omg
[08:53:16] <waltercon> no
[08:53:24] <itatitat> but now, how can I acces to a son element from that element father with an event?
[08:53:32] <LukeNukem> I dont know why you need two validators waltercon
[08:53:45] <waltercon> because one does the required field validators
[08:54:02] <waltercon> and the other does this complex shit on the server
[08:54:26] <waltercon> and the way its made there are these like controls and the validators go with the control
[08:54:39] <waltercon> but i just want to submit so the validators will fire
[08:54:50] <waltercon> but not actually submit cause i want to post using ajax
[08:54:59] <waltercon> so i dont lose the values in case the server says something is wrong
[08:55:14] <waltercon> so how do i do it
[08:55:18] <LukeNukem> waltercon, you can do the required field validation on server side too
[08:55:29] <LukeNukem> who wrote this code waltercon ?
[08:55:35] <waltercon> that will be a pain in the ass
[08:55:48] <waltercon> cause then i got to find the field that is messed up
[08:55:50] <waltercon> send it back
[08:55:51] <LukeNukem> nope haha
[08:55:53] <waltercon> map it
[08:55:53] <LukeNukem> learn php
[08:55:56] <waltercon> fuck that shit
[08:56:02] <waltercon> luke nukem
[08:56:03] <waltercon> dood
[08:56:10] <LukeNukem> if(empty($_POST['field'])){}
[08:56:19] <waltercon> do u know how to submit without actually submiting
[08:56:27] <waltercon> quit with the php
[08:56:31] <LukeNukem> waltercon, i just told you how to submit without submitting
[08:56:31] <waltercon> i aint using that
[08:56:31] <LukeNukem> ^_^
[08:56:37] <LukeNukem> msfanboi :P
[08:56:59] <dorgan> if i have HTML coming back in a jsonp ajax post is there a way to query that with jquery?
[08:57:07] <brianloveswords> waltercon: You are asking for the impossible. If you want the server side validation, you NEED to hit the server with the data.
[08:57:12] <waltercon> what use prevent default action?
[08:57:20] <waltercon> i do hit it
[08:57:22] <waltercon> brian
[08:57:24] <waltercon> with ajax
[08:57:28] <waltercon> but before i hit it
[08:57:35] <waltercon> i want the required field validators to fire
[08:57:44] <waltercon> if that passes then do the ajax
[08:57:58] <LukeNukem> brianloveswords, i keep trying to tell him :|
[08:58:00] <LukeNukem> he wont listen
[08:58:02] <LukeNukem> he is stubborn
[08:58:03] <waltercon> but the required field validators dont fire when i do a $.post()
[08:58:03] <LukeNukem> and confused
[08:58:18] <LukeNukem> waltercon, who wrote the asp code?
[08:58:21] <brianloveswords> waltercon: So if you don't attach your ajax handler, do the required validators fire?
[08:58:23] <waltercon> so i changed the input type to input = submit
[08:58:30] <LukeNukem> fuck this shit
[08:58:33] <nlogax> i don't see the form there or anything, but if you e.preventDefault(), where e is the event object passed to the event listener, it should stop the form from submitting, and your validators should run unless weird
[08:58:36] <LukeNukem> i just fell from a motherfucking building and im still alive
[08:58:39] <LukeNukem> i gotta celebrate
[08:58:39] <waltercon> it fires when u have a submit input
[08:58:39] <LukeNukem> ^_^
[08:58:54] <waltercon> the ajax doesnt prevent it from firing
[08:59:07] <waltercon> the ajax just doesnt cause them to fire
[08:59:15] <LukeNukem> waltercon, POST YOUR FUCKING CODE
[08:59:16] <LukeNukem> :|
[08:59:17] <waltercon> i mean i changed my input to type button
[08:59:37] <brianloveswords> Get it back to the state where required validators are firing.
[08:59:46] <brianloveswords> So revert all your changes until you get to that point.
[08:59:48] <LukeNukem> brianloveswords, i think he is a client who is trying to edit a freelancers work O_O
[08:59:52] <LukeNukem> he just does not post his code
[08:59:55] <LazyTown> when I attach an event to a link using .on() how can I get access to the link?  will it be stored in $(this) ?
[09:00:02] <waltercon> so the page wont refresh so i can do $.post but that doesnt trigger my required field validators
[09:00:19] <waltercon> ya its at that point now
[09:00:26] <waltercon> the only problem is
[09:00:41] <LukeNukem> LazyTown, yes
[09:00:43] <waltercon> when the server side validatation fires it takes me to a different page
[09:00:51] <_ramok> hi
[09:00:52] <LukeNukem> waltercon, THATS WHY U HAVE TO USE AJAX
[09:00:53] <waltercon> i want to stay on the same page
[09:00:56] <LukeNukem> jesus how many times did i just explain this!!
[09:01:00] <waltercon> i am using ajax
[09:01:01] <_ramok> how can i remove an element entirely that has a specific class?
[09:01:05] <LazyTown> LukeNukem,  thank you
[09:01:11] <silverwind> LukeNukem, perhaps you're not made to help people...
[09:01:11] <waltercon> but the problem is the input type is of submit
[09:01:34] <LukeNukem> silverwind, if you haven't noticed, i've been trying for the past few minutes explaining the same thing over and over again
[09:01:37] <LukeNukem> its like he does not listen
[09:01:45] <waltercon> i prevent this by turning it to type button
[09:01:58] <waltercon> but that stops the required field validators from fireing
[09:01:59] <silverwind> LukeNukem, I know.. helping can be a pain sometimes.
[09:02:09] <waltercon> lukenukem i dotn think u are getting it
[09:02:10] <waltercon> at all
[09:02:17] <LukeNukem> Yeah im not getting it
[09:02:21] <LukeNukem> you keep saying random stuff
[09:02:21] <waltercon> i mean i been repeating myself
[09:02:28] <jgorrie> _ramok - Have you taken a guess?
[09:02:35] <_ramok> i'm using something like: $('.'+currentClass).remove();  but this is not removing every element with "currentClass" , some stay on the screen, some removes
[09:02:36] <LukeNukem> waltercon, ok, lets go over this once more. Start!
[09:02:42] <brianloveswords> waltercon: I think I get it.
[09:02:43] <waltercon> ok
[09:02:50] <waltercon> there are type validators
[09:02:52] <_ramok> jgorrie: yeah, it seems i had ;)
[09:02:53] <brianloveswords> waltercon: Whoever made the required validators are attaching to the form.
[09:02:55] <LukeNukem> _ramok, pastie the code.
[09:03:02] <jgorrie> _ramok: What did you do?
[09:03:05] <waltercon> ya
[09:03:18] <brianloveswords> waltercon: $('form').on('submit', function(){ /* whatever */ })
[09:03:21] <waltercon> they only work when its submit
[09:03:32] <LukeNukem> brianloveswords, its obviously a javascript validation so obviously it should work fine before the ajax request, dont you think
[09:03:41] <_ramok> LukeNukem: http://privatepaste.com/53062b74c8/fadsfsafdsaf
[09:03:53] <_ramok> i have list elements with different classes...
[09:03:57] <brianloveswords> LukeNukem: I don't think he's doing a real submit, I think he's scraping the data and doing a post.
[09:04:01] <waltercon> lukenukem the problem is they dont get triggered
[09:04:05] <brianloveswords> LukeNukem: So the on submit won't fire.
[09:04:17] <_ramok> and if i click on that i have to do a action, categorization, and after that, the list entry should disappear
[09:04:28] <_ramok> that works for most of the li's, but some stays for ever...
[09:04:31] <waltercon> when i do a real submit then they fire
[09:04:38] <waltercon> when i do a ajax submit they dont fire
[09:04:42] <waltercon> thats the problem
[09:04:49] <brianloveswords> waltercon: Yeah, because whoever coded up the required validators are attaching it to the form's `submit` event.
[09:04:50] <waltercon> but i dont want a real submit
[09:04:58] <LukeNukem> waltercon, for the last time. Please post your code!
[09:05:01] <waltercon> cause i want to do an ajax submit
[09:05:15] <LukeNukem> waltercon, are you a asp.net developer?
[09:05:15] <jgorrie> _ramok, where is the currentClass set?
[09:05:35] <LukeNukem> _ralph, currentClass is not set -_-
[09:05:44] <brandonc503_> $("input#shipping-email")     ---- what goes here to add ----    $("input#shipping-name").val($("input#email").val());
[09:05:48] <waltercon> http://jsfiddle.net/ydZqQ/1/
[09:05:50] <waltercon> there u go
[09:06:01] <waltercon> i am a asp.net mvc developer
[09:06:13] <_ramok> jgorrie: in a method that looks like: http://privatepaste.com/cc70bf4df0/fadsfsafdsaf
[09:06:38] <LukeNukem> <script src="/Scripts/jquery.validate.min.js"
[09:06:43] <LukeNukem> You are using a plugin to validatre
[09:06:45] <LukeNukem> validate*
[09:06:52] <waltercon> ok
[09:06:53] <LukeNukem> why didn't you say so?
[09:07:01] <waltercon> i didnt know i was
[09:07:05] <LukeNukem> That would have made this a whole lot easier lol
[09:07:09] <LukeNukem> waltercon, who wrote this code?
[09:07:13] <waltercon> not me
[09:07:25] <waltercon> i have to fix it tho
[09:07:38] <waltercon> look man i work at ups
[09:07:48] <waltercon> there are people writing code in india an shit
[09:07:54] <LukeNukem> im Indian
[09:07:56] <LukeNukem> :3
[09:08:03] <waltercon> ok
[09:08:14] <LukeNukem> and your issue right now is?
[09:08:25] <waltercon> i want to do an ajax post
[09:08:30] <waltercon> but the validatotion
[09:08:34] <waltercon> client side
[09:08:35] <waltercon> dont work
[09:08:40] <waltercon> unless it is a submit
[09:08:48] <waltercon> that my prob
[09:08:50] <LukeNukem> waltercon, well you are doing a submit
[09:09:00] <waltercon> ya well i changed it back
[09:09:00] <LukeNukem> but you are just preventing the default action which is to load a new page
[09:09:16] <LukeNukem> waltercon, one second

[09:12:16] <davidjdagino> i'd like to get some jquery-ui tabs inside of a jquery-ui dialog. it's not quite working out for me. can anyone offer some advice? thank you.
[09:12:49] <shoky> some advice?
[09:12:56] <shoky> read the docs
[09:13:16] <LukeNukem> davidjdagino, create a div for modal
[09:13:19] <LukeNukem> create tabs inside it :3
[09:13:27] <LukeNukem> seemplee as thhat
[09:16:01] <davidjdagino> LukeNukem: I'm currently doing that, but it's still a bit broken. I'll take another look at it though. thanks
[09:16:26] <_ramok> LukeNukem: does .remove() doesn't work well, if i have a class definition with a whitespace, for example classe="this_is_a test"   or would ('.this_is_a test').remove() remove the element with this class definition?
[09:16:42] <LukeNukem> brb
[09:16:44] <LukeNukem> dinner :P
[09:19:12] <NoiseEee> _ramok: the latter.
[09:20:32] <_ramok> NoiseEee: my issue is, that all mails with an class like "this_is_a" are removed, but elements with "this_is_a test" are not removed... but after a refresh of the page
[09:20:52] <NoiseEee> ?demo @ _ramok
[09:20:52] <bot-t> _ramok, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:21:03] <_ramok> hm, let's try
[09:26:31] <kollapse> Hello. I know i can use $(window).resize() to monitor window resizing. But what I really need is something like .onResizeStop()
[09:26:37] <kollapse> Is there any such function ?
[09:27:06] <ajpiano> kollapse: you want to use a debounce on the resize events
[09:27:11] <ajpiano> ?debounce @ kollapse
[09:27:12] <bot-t> kollapse, Ben Alman  jQuery throttle / debounce: Sometimes, less is more! - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[09:28:44] <kollapse> Hmm, isn't it possible with a global boolean and .mouseup() as well ?
[09:28:58] <ajpiano> kollapse: uhhh
[09:29:09] <ajpiano> not sure why you'd ever want to solve it that way
[09:29:33] <ajpiano> kollapse: the "debounce" just means a self-canceling timeout so that ultimately the handler is only fired just *after* the last of a repeated event
[09:30:03] <kollapse> Ah, my bad, I meant mouse click release. But I will give debounce a try. Thanks.
[09:31:26] <kollapse> ajpiano: Double thanks for debounce, I can use this with ajax calls.
[09:31:31] <kollapse> :)
[09:31:34] <ajpiano> indeed
[09:31:40] <nmee> Hi, I'm making a simple jquery plugin, and I have the following code:   MyPlugin.prototype.myfunction = function(){ $(window).bind('resize.myplugin', this.otherfunction); };     - the idea being that after calling myObject.myfunction(), resizing the window will call myObject.otherfunction() (on the same object) - however, currently, `this` in otherfunction is a DOMWindow object, not myObject.
[09:31:54] <ajpiano> ?proxy @ nmee
[09:31:55] <bot-t> nmee, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[09:32:30] <Whirl3d> so when using jqueryUI to add animate adding a class to an element, it is not a deep animation? In other words, nested dependent styles aren't animated, correct?
[09:33:16] <Whirl3d> that was not an easy question to word..don't know if I asked correctly.
[09:34:10] <fuchstronaut> when having a jq object cached, how do i traverse through it, without using find()? i tried myObj.children('table > tbody > tr.classname') but that didn't worked for me
[09:34:51] <nmee> ajpiano: brilliant, thanks!
[09:37:03] <nFFF> fuchstronaut, curious to why without find specifically?
[09:37:47] <fuchstronaut> there is a lot of markup and i just need that table > ..., and i dont want it to look deeper into the markup for performance sake
[09:38:05] <fuchstronaut> i mean i could propably chain children(), but that wouldnt help i guess
[09:38:14] <brandonc503_> $("input#shipping-email")     ---- what goes here to add ----    $("input#shipping-name").val($("input#email").val());
[09:42:31] <Soleino^> Hello, please whats wrong with this http://pastebin.com/P6Ynkk56
[09:42:57] <Soleino^> What i want to do is when i click in a button a value in the form is set to checked
[09:44:50] <ravenzz> Soleino^ where is the markup?
[09:45:06] <ravenzz> make a testcase on jsfiddle.net
[09:46:05] <Soleino^> ok
[09:48:50] <LazyTown> If I load a form dynamically into a Modal dialog, what is the best way to bind a function to a drop down box?
[09:50:24] <Soleino^> here it is http://jsfiddle.net/GgafK/
[09:50:32] <Soleino^> > ravenzz
[09:51:51] <Soleino^> Mmm it works on this test
[09:51:53] <ravenzz> ok seems that it is working
[09:51:56] <ravenzz> yes
[09:52:28] <ravenzz> anyway I would add the buttons in JS
[09:52:52] <ravenzz> they are useless without js
[09:53:50] <Soleino^> yes but im using another js
[09:53:57] <Soleino^> form is in a jquery dialog
[09:54:26] <zerobeholder> so, I am loading content with .load('./directory/file.php') --loads fine the php is being parsed and outputting correctly. But it feels like it is not part of the DOM even though valid XML format tags are being inserted in place of nearly identical tags.
[09:55:25] <zerobeholder> Am I going to need addChild and the other fun dom stuff to bind events to the newly inserted content?
[09:58:43] <Mohsen_Hassani> How can I uncheck a checkbox using Jquery? I have tried so many properties but none worked. removeAttr, val, attr
[09:58:52] <zerobeholder> I have tried two examples from http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:AJAX_and_Events
[09:59:01] <shoky> "feels like" ?
[09:59:38] <shoky> Mohsen_Hassani: $('#theCheckBox').prop('checked', true)
[09:59:56] <zerobeholder> $('#selector').attr('checked', 'false'); I think
[10:00:05] <shoky> ah uncheck, yes
[10:00:09] <shoky> not attr
[10:00:10] <shoky> prop.
[10:01:01] <supsup> why would someone put // in front of a www or http://
[10:01:09] <Mohsen_Hassani> it's not working $("#passage_checkbox").prop('checked', false);
[10:01:35] <Mohsen_Hassani> neither attr('checked', false);
[10:01:44] <shoky> ?demo @ Mohsen_Hassani
[10:01:44] <bot-t> Mohsen_Hassani, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:01:47] <zerobeholder> Oooh, time to learn. Why is .prop preferrable to .attr? I've been using attr recently.
[10:02:08] <shoky> it's not always preferable, depends if you want to set an attribute or a property :P
[10:02:19] <shoky> attributes are HTML tag attributes
[10:02:24] <shoky> properties are dynamic DOM properties
[10:02:44] <shoky> checked is both an attribute (you can write 'checked' as attribute in html)
[10:03:03] <shoky> and a DOM property (you can change it dynamically with .prop)
[10:03:12] <zerobeholder> $("#option").removeAttr("checked"); for the attr way. --I can see how .prop is better for people that want an intact DOM structure though.
[10:03:23] <shoky> an intact DOM structure?
[10:03:33] <shoky> oh
[10:03:36] <shoky> nm
[10:04:10] <zerobeholder> Yeah, I could have worded that better.
[10:04:29] <shoky> no you're right, i through you were referring to .attr
[10:04:34] <shoky> thought*
[10:05:44] <shoky> this was an informative read for me on the subject: http://timmywillison.com/2011/When-to-use-.attr()-and-.prop().html
[10:05:47] <zerobeholder> http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[10:06:05] <shoky> at least i think so, since i have it  bookmarked
[10:10:26] <tomasm-> hi, if i want to see if a node (a form in my case) has a specific event handler, do I use $('form').data('events') to get the list?
[10:10:54] <LazyTown> is this legal:  jqryObjectDiv.find('.selector').on("click", function(){...}); ?
[10:11:34] <tomasm-> LazyTown, you can put '.selector' as the 2nd param to on(), instead of having the 'find()'
[10:12:06] <zerobeholder> .on never works right for me because I'm a noob. I prefer .bind but that is just me and may not help your problem.
[10:12:26] <LazyTown> I'm trying to "convert"
[10:12:56] <LazyTown> tomasm, thank you.  I will give it a shot.
[10:13:03] <BarelyFitz> tomasm-: that might work but I don't think that is officially exposed API, so could be dangerous
[10:13:06] <tomasm-> LazyTown, usually on() gets applied to a very broad object (maybe document) and then you specify what for in the 2nd param
[10:13:31] <syn_y0> http://tinyurl.com/d39wd4s im working on a mobile version for one of my websites. but i got problems with data-role="footer" it isnt at the correct position and when i add the  data-position="fixed" it completely hidden..
[10:13:49] <LazyTown> tomasm, my div holds dynamically loaded content,  so I'm checking to see if it contains certain elements to bind functions too
[10:15:12] <zerobeholder> That is the problem I am currently having as well. LazyTown-- it works with the initially loaded content. Then I put new stuff in with .load --which seems fine. Then bam even if I try re-.bind-ing the click event nothing happens.
[10:15:32] <zerobeholder> Tried bubbling.
[10:15:42] <LazyTown> zerobeholder, did bubbling work for you?
[10:15:48] <zerobeholder> No.
[10:15:49] <tomasm-> zerobeholder, why doesn't on() work for you?
[10:15:56] <LazyTown> lol
[10:16:02] <zerobeholder> I have not recently tried .on.
[10:16:33] <tomasm-> zerobeholder, if content is added at runtime, you can have event handlers declared ahead of time via on(), instead of putting them with the new content... a lot easier in some cases
[10:16:55] <zerobeholder> This page didn't help me, but it seemed to have a nice succinct way of saying stuff. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:AJAX_and_Events
[10:17:12] <zerobeholder> I will give on another chance. I have burned days messing with .on.
[10:19:21] <Soleino^> how can i look for all values in the form and calculate dynamicly total :
[10:20:54] <zerobeholder> I've done something similar with .length a long time ago.
[10:21:23] <zerobeholder> Sorry, disregard, you are looking for a total and I was doing a count.
[10:21:25] <Soleino^> here is an example : http://jsfiddle.net/GgafK/6/
[10:21:45] <tomasm-> zerobeholder, DAYS? eek.... it's pretty simple, $(document).on('click', 'a.something', function(event) { ... })
[10:21:50] <Soleino^> wait ive something wronb
[10:21:52] <Soleino^> wrong
[10:22:18] <Soleino^> http://jsfiddle.net/GgafK/7/
[10:24:37] <shoky> Soleino^: seems to work
[10:26:52] <zerobeholder> Well, I'm still mediocre at best. I've wandered in and out of programming for years. Wandering back in a lot lately.
[10:27:01] <Soleino^> shoky what i want to do is click to select an item, then calculate all the items checked
[10:27:12] <zerobeholder> Wide base, shallow experience...
[10:27:25] <shoky> Soleino^ with a radio button group you can only select one
[10:27:41] <zerobeholder> Try checkboxes...
[10:29:13] <Soleino^> it always works on jsfiddle and not on my page, wtf .. http://jsfiddle.net/GgafK/10/
[10:30:16] <shoky> you told jsfiddle to run that code in an onLoad handler
[10:30:26] <shoky> did you tell your own code to do the same or similar
[10:33:02] <zerobeholder> $(document).ready(function() { ...your code that you want available for event triggers... };
[10:33:49] <zerobeholder> This is where I put my .bind stuff (and my brand new .on stuff today) to get it recognized.
[10:34:45] <zerobeholder> It is usually the last thing included of the javascript I have either linked or hard coded into the head section.
[10:35:27] <zerobeholder> That way any functions referenced have been seen by the browser (hopefully).
[10:36:27] <tomasm-> hi, is there a way to tell if a call to trigger() did anything or not? i want to do an alternative handler if the first one did not exist
[10:37:15] <supsup> add a console.log
[10:37:28] <supsup> like console.log("trigger happened");
[10:37:40] <supsup> or you can add break points if you use chrome dev tools or firebug
[10:37:44] <supsup> or some other stuff
[10:37:53] <tomasm-> supsup, no, i mean logically, if!(foo.trigger('one')) { foo.trigger('alt'); }
[10:37:58] <johnkpaul> tomasm-: the event handlers do not know about each other
[10:38:00] <tomasm-> supsup, not for debugging
[10:38:07] <johnkpaul> if you need to share state, you need to do it explicitly
[10:38:25] <johnkpaul> something seems odd if you're needing to do that, tomasm-
[10:38:50] <johnkpaul> worst case, just set some value to $.data(el in your first handler
[10:38:55] <johnkpaul> and check if it's there in your second
[10:40:05] <tomasm-> the handlers are on irrelevent objects, i just need to see if the handler exists on the first, and if so, then chain the handlers together, so two event handlers get done synchronously (via callbacks) instead of asynchronously
[10:40:29] <danzik171> tomasm-: no idea how your event handlers are structured.  if these are the only two, you could always add a .stopImmediatePropagation in the first, then the second will never be fired.  if the first doesn't exist, then the second will fire.
[10:40:45] <tomasm-> danzik171, they are not related objects
[10:41:53] <tomasm-> I though $(container).data('events') was removed from jquery.... but it seems to be working on mine (1.7), where $._data(container, 'events') does NOT work... I don't get it
[10:42:19] <brandonc503_> heya, how do i get ...
[10:42:23] <brandonc503_>     $("input#same").click(function(){
[10:42:23] <brandonc503_>         if ($("input#same").is(':checked'))
[10:42:25] <zerobeholder> (Usually when people are telling me stuff like this, I am doing something wrong. If you are double thumbs up on that, then carry on. This may be an opportunity to rethink your logic.)
[10:42:26] <danzik171> tomasm-: don't use that, that's for internal use by jquery and subject to change ( and IS changing in 1.8 )
[10:42:31] <brandonc503_> to be some kind of when key pressed for input.clonethis
[10:42:49] <brandonc503_> i keep screwing it up
[10:42:50] <tomasm-> danzik171, ok well how do I see if an object has a handler set or not?
[10:43:43] <danzik171> tomasm-: i'm sure there's a nicer way, but one way is to implement your handlers using $.Callbacks
[10:43:46] <shoky> there's no supported way to do that
[10:43:50] <supsup> u could do object['handler'] typeof function ?
[10:43:52] <shoky> afaik
[10:43:55] <danzik171> then have the actual event handler call the callbacks.fire method
[10:44:03] <supsup> o that just means its there not set
[10:44:13] <tomasm-> I have a form handler and a container handler (the form updates the container).... the form has some after-submit code in it's handler, and the container has some after-updated code in it's handler.... but it needs to be synchronous, IF there is a handler on the form....
[10:44:15] <danzik171> but you lose some functionality, namely stopImmediatePropagation
[10:44:57] <syn_y0> dat fucking footer in jquery mobilte.. grml
[10:47:55] <tomasm-> actually, wait, it seems like the handlers ARE on the same object... but is there a way to bind() a handler and tell it to move to the top of the list (fire first, synchronously, before any others)? or is it just which event handler is defined last?
[10:48:34] <danzik171> tomasm-: they're fired in the order that they were bound, and they're already synchronous
[10:49:00] <tomasm-> ok well I just need the last one added to go first
[10:49:42] <shoky> then why did you bind the other events first
[10:49:58] <tomasm-> shoky, because it's some more generic code
[10:50:19] <shoky> that's not an answer to the question tho ;p
[10:50:38] <tomasm-> shoky, it's the way the code is structured.... i cant change it
[10:51:07] <shoky> when you (or other code that you're using) binds an event
[10:51:12] <shoky> that means it wants to handle that event
[10:51:29] <shoky> if you dont want it to, then dont bind it, or dont call code that binds it
[10:51:35] <tomasm-> hmmm, wait....
[10:51:50] <shoky> you can also just .off all events of a certain type
[10:52:06] <shoky> but you can't mess with the order.. at least not in a documented way
[10:52:28] <shoky> afaik, of course
[10:52:57] <tomasm-> i think i have a way around it....
[10:54:53] <shoky> i notice you like your 4 dots ....
[10:55:02] <shoky> very consistent
[10:55:39] <shoky> i should find something to do
[10:56:17] <tomasm-> shoky ???? (see, I like question marks too)
[10:56:28] <renobird> Hi All.  I'm having a little trouble with submit() and post data.
[10:56:56] <tomasm-> ok i just put a totally different custom handler before the other handler, to get it in the right order
[10:57:15] <renobird> the form works properly when submitted normally, but if I use submit() then no post data is sent.
[10:57:16] <shoky> tomasm- sounds nice
[10:57:29] <tomasm-> ....
[10:57:32] <shoky> ^^^^
[10:57:45] <zerobeholder> try $('formid').submit();
[10:58:05] <shoky> doesn't that just call form.submit() ?
[10:58:18] <renobird> either method fails.
[10:58:58] <renobird> tried renaming my input something other than name="submit"
[10:58:59] <NoiseEee> is the form method set to "post" ?
[10:59:09] <renobird> NoiseEee: yep
[10:59:41] <zerobeholder> They both fail. PHP or ASP to handle the server acceptance?
[10:59:44] <renobird> I've checked all the usual suspects.
[10:59:57] <renobird> zerobeholder: PHP
[11:00:17] <zerobeholder> have you tried var_dump[$_POST]; ?
[11:00:18] <SnackWhack> Once upon a time, in a Notepad  far far away, I wrote the following code: http://jsfiddle.net/pGKKb/ <- The ida was to hide an existing button, and add 2 links after a couple input boxes. But, for the life of me, I can't figure out where I put the text for linkA and link B. Anyone know where that would have been specified? Perhaps in CSS?
[11:00:51] <zerobeholder> 100% empty...
[11:01:06] <Whirl3d> hey all. What's the best way to handle this sort of thing: I have an object literal with several attributes. Some of thse attributes have prefixes in their names. like sourceObj={startCcolor:"green", endColor:"red", startValue:"test", endValue"testagain"}. I want to split this one object into many objects based on the fieldnames. Is there a regexy-way to do it, or do I just hashtable it out?
[11:01:39] <Whirl3d> *fieldnames, I mean *attribute names
[11:02:38] <zerobeholder> <form method="post" action="processform.php"><inputs name="necessarynames"... /></form>
[11:02:59] <zerobeholder> I would assume all your inputs have names...
[11:03:04] <renobird> zerobeholder: yeah, var_dump gives me array(0) { }
[11:03:15] <renobird> all inputs are named.
[11:03:19] <zerobeholder> ok
[11:03:30] <renobird> reduced it to just a single input to test.
[11:04:46] <renobird> zerobeholder: I can paste the code (very simple) if you had a quick minute to glance over it.
[11:05:07] <zerobeholder> hardcoding the submit button <input type="submit" /> didn't help? form is closed </form> --Are you using a framework?
[11:05:34] <zerobeholder> Sure, I just got helped a little while ago and it is only fair to stick around and do my best for a little while.
[11:05:58] <renobird> zerobeholder: OK, posting in a quick minute
[11:09:32] <renobird> zerobeholder: http://pastebin.com/fCPHGF48
[11:12:09] <zerobeholder> Got it, brb.
[11:12:21] <zerobeholder> Reading the pastebin.
[11:12:58] <axscode> http://pastebin.com/NJhWE45c  <--- can someone give me a hand on this please..
[11:15:36] <ximarin> hi all, question: I have a loop like this $(".class").each(function(){ ... }); Inside the each, I now need to select a child of the current 'this'. How can I do this?
[11:15:51] <zerobeholder> renobird: is there a reason you are preventing the default submission?
[11:16:17] <renobird> review modal (left that out because it fails even without that.)
[11:16:17] <zerobeholder> I am assuming there is, but just asking.
[11:18:28] <_pr0t0type_> Hey guys.  Do you think it is good practice to pass in the event parameter to lambdas that don't use it?  For instance $().click(function(event){ don't use event });
[11:18:53] <johnkpaul> ximarin: $(this).children().first()
[11:19:02] <shoky> Whirl3d the only regex i can think of to help you there is:  attrName.match( new RegExp("/^" + prefix + "(.+)/") )
[11:19:25] <axscode> how can i do like  var _myvar = "string";  var _newvar= "_myvar";  print _newvar;   <-- it should print "string"
[11:19:40] <ximarin> johnkpaul: and what if the child isnt the first? but I know its id?
[11:19:50] <johnkpaul> oh sorry, a child
[11:19:54] <johnkpaul> I thought you meant the first child
[11:20:00] <ximarin> not neccessarily
[11:20:01] <johnkpaul> ximarin: if you know it's id, just select it directly
[11:20:13] <johnkpaul> if it is not the first child then use $(this).children("selector")
[11:20:13] <ximarin> I only know part of it
[11:20:33] <ximarin> ah so insife the children I can use a standard selector?
[11:20:48] <zerobeholder> renobird: http://pastebin.com/MnWyZGTM
[11:21:06] <johnkpaul> ximarin: yes
[11:21:08] <johnkpaul> ?children @ximarin
[11:21:11] <bot-t> ximarin, .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[11:21:46] <zerobeholder> renobird: The code as is works on my dev server...
[11:22:21] <zerobeholder> Sorry, what I sent is not what I uploaded, brb.
[11:27:18] <Renacor> anybody here familiar with easyXDM?
[11:27:38] <ximarin> johnkpaul: great, works, thx!
[11:29:11] <Whirl3d> anybody got a quick reference to a list of animatable properties in jquery? Or should I just start sifting through googlegarbage?
[11:30:56] <Krinkle-away> ?animate
[11:30:56] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[11:31:20] <zerobeholder> renobird: still playing
[11:31:24] <johnkpaul> x0F: no problem
[11:31:58] <renobird> zerobeholder: thanks. Me too. I used .submit() before with success, but this has be stumped.
[11:32:09] <Chopps> hey guys, i have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/JVHOLiK/FqMuN/ as u can tell on every click of the button i clone the div containing the inputs and then i append the clone to the parent div, each appended clone has a number added to its id, so the ids should be toClone2, toClone3, and so on.. ok, so my quesion is, is there any way to change append the number of the parent div to the ids of the
[11:32:09] <Chopps> input fields inside it?
[11:32:23] <BaruchHashem> i am using jCycle and my pager buttons are showing up behind the picture
[11:32:38] <BaruchHashem> i cant click them, they are behind the image
[11:32:55] <BaruchHashem> however, on my full width everything works fine
[11:33:02] <renobird> BaruchHashem: z-index?
[11:33:02] <BaruchHashem> its a responsive site
[11:33:21] <BaruchHashem> the z-index isnt changing in my responsive layouts so i dont see how that can be it
[11:33:25] <Whirl3d> Basically, animate should animate any numeric property, right?
[11:33:48] <axscode> how can i do in javascript/jquery  like in PHP, $var = "string"; $variablename = "var";  print $$variable_name ;
[11:35:14] <renobird> BaruchHashem:  I forget if cycle changes z-index of the container or not, but try upping the z-index of your pager
[11:35:18] <axscode> how can i do in javascript/jquery  like in PHP, $var = "string"; $variablename = "var";  print $$variablename ;  <-sorry to be exact
[11:35:25] <BaruchHashem> i did up the z-index to no results :(
[11:35:49] <RandalSchwartz> variable-variables is generally a sign of bad design
[11:35:54] <BaruchHashem> when the width of my page hits 990px everything works great, i know the buttons are there lower than that cause when i take away position absolute of hte pictures the buttons reaapear kinda
[11:35:58] <RandalSchwartz> and it's sad that PHP gets people thinking that way
[11:36:00] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: what are you trying to animate?
[11:36:49] <johnkpaul> axscode: code with those exact semantics are not possible in javascript because you can't lookup values in the current scope
[11:37:04] <johnkpaul> if you have an object, you can use a string to access it's proeprties though, which can simulate something like taht
[11:37:13] <johnkpaul> but, as RandalSchwartz  said, taht's not necessarily a good idea
[11:37:21] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: yes, any numeric property should work, what are you trying to do
[11:37:32] <axscode> http://pastebin.com/NJhWE45c  <--- can u help out a bit how to atain this?
[11:37:41] <renobird> BaruchHashem: sounds like a CSS issue, if the pager is appearing, then cycle is working.
[11:37:55] <renobird> BaruchHashem: are you using the pager method here: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/int2.html
[11:37:57] <RandalSchwartz> axscode - bad idea
[11:38:00] <BaruchHashem> sigh guess so, those css jerks are gonna yell at me for bringing up jquery
[11:38:14] <johnkpaul> :) axscode, javascript is not php
[11:38:16] <johnkpaul> ?learn @axscode
[11:38:16] <bot-t> axscode, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[11:38:19] <BaruchHashem> no im using jquery.cycle
[11:38:40] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, I'm trying to filter a parameter passed to a function so that rather than having a huge object with {startprop:startVal, endprop:endVal, cssprop:cssVal} I end up with {start:{prop:val}, end:{prop:val}, css:[prop:val}}
[11:38:53] <renobird> BaruchHashem: yeah, that's one of the demo pages for cycle
[11:39:07] <BaruchHashem> ah yeah thats what im using
[11:39:19] <BaruchHashem> the pager one
[11:39:20] <axscode> yes, john i know that.. can someone lend a hand please.. i would willing to learn how to achieve to this kind of problem.
[11:40:05] <RandalSchwartz> axscode - you can't
[11:40:12] <RandalSchwartz> not without using some sort of eval
[11:40:17] <Whirl3d> at first, I was okay with just splitting out the start and end and whatever was left was css. But then I thought I'd search for css properties and THEN split out the start props and the end props. Now I don't know which way to turn?
[11:40:18] <RandalSchwartz> and that's *really* bad
[11:40:41] <renobird> BaruchHashem: if you have absolute positioned photos, and the pager is behind that, then it really sounds a z-index issue.  Is your pager element set to position relative?
[11:40:58] <renobird> z-index only works on elements with position attribute.
[11:41:00] <johnkpaul> so axscode, you can achieve something similar, in your code, by using properties in an object
[11:41:03] <BaruchHashem> no, but i set it to relative to no results
[11:41:05] <johnkpaul> rather than variables
[11:41:19] <BaruchHashem> cycle sets the pictures absolute
[11:41:31] <BaruchHashem> and gives them all z-indexes
[11:41:31] <axscode> i think im too noob for J
[11:41:38] <johnkpaul> so something like obj = {};obj["_3lm"] = phpwahtever
[11:41:47] <johnkpaul> obj["_ng"] = phpwhtever
[11:42:00] <johnkpaul> axscode: yes, I'd recommend that you actually try to learn javascript
[11:42:55] <renobird> BaruchHashem: right, I remember now.  the individual "slides" have low z-indexes. you set your pager to something like z-index: 999
[11:43:06] <shoky> Whirl3d: why not split all 3 in the same loop
[11:43:10] <renobird> BaruchHashem: no results on that?
[11:43:31] <BaruchHashem> no, but i think i may have found the problem, one sec
[11:43:44] <shoky> Whirl3d: and how does that relate to animatable properties?
[11:44:09] <en3r0> hello
[11:44:15] <BaruchHashem> solved it; you need to set the slider ID to z-index:-1
[11:44:17] <Chopps> hey guys, i have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/JVHOLiK/FqMuN/ is there any way to append the number assigned to the parent div to the ids of the children elements?
[11:45:17] <johnkpaul> Chopps: "the number assigned to the parent div"?
[11:45:58] <BaruchHashem> thanks for the help
[11:46:13] <renobird> BaruchHashem:  you get it figured out?
[11:46:52] <renobird> BaruchHashem: I see your post now.
[11:47:08] <renobird> BaruchHashem: glad you got it sorted.  :D
[11:47:13] <Chopps> johnkpaul in the example i provide, i clone a div that has inputs in it, after i clone it i append a number to the id, eg: id=toClone2, id=toClone3, etc, after the id changes i append the cloned element to the parent, i want to append that number to the element's children
[11:48:03] <thiessenp> Oi does anyone know of any good plugins or methods to use JS to parse international text (Spanish for example)? Would like to do some replaces with regexp.
[11:48:38] <en3r0> trying to extract images from any given rss feed. any pointers? would be nice if this has been done before, but i cant find anything..
[11:48:46] <johnkpaul> Chopps: http://jsfiddle.net/FqMuN/1/
[11:49:27] <diverdude> Hello. I am considering how to create thumbs. In my server i am generating thumbs of size 80x80. when thumb does not fit in 80x80 i can either create png and do alphablending on "free" areas of the thumb, but png files are quite big. Could i do some clever javascripting and use jpeg instead and thereby save the bandwidth?
[11:49:54] <zerobeholder> renobird: you have a new tab.
[11:50:22] <johnkpaul> en3r0: jquery cannot, by itself, get access to an rss feed on another domain
[11:50:31] <shoky> diverdude: clever javascripting that does what?
[11:50:40] <zerobeholder> The submit button sends to a processing script that simply prints out the post var. But the link is broken again.
[11:50:58] <whoev> so if i need to dynamically load content from another domain - does the SOP make this impossible?
[11:51:01] <johnkpaul> shoky: save bandwidth, duh
[11:51:12] <b-lew> is there a reason why my #tickertwo li:last isn't getting selected? http://pastiebin.com/?page=p&id=4f9edeefd4554
[11:51:15] <shoky> heh
[11:51:17] <whoev> like, if i want someone to be able to use an embed script from my site
[11:51:21] <whoev> without using an iframe?
[11:51:25] <johnkpaul> whoev: not impossible, but not straightforward
[11:51:29] <johnkpaul> you can either use jsonp
[11:51:30] <whoev> what is the best way then
[11:51:33] <johnkpaul> or cross origin resource sharing
[11:51:38] <whoev> i can't edit anything serverside on their server
[11:51:44] <johnkpaul> :) then no
[11:51:45] <en3r0> johnkpaul: did not know that
[11:51:52] <whoev> iframes only then?
[11:51:59] <diverdude> shoky: makes the images transparent
[11:52:06] <johnkpaul> well that won't work either for 2 way communication
[11:52:14] <johnkpaul> ^^ @whoev
[11:52:21] <whoev> it wouldn't?
[11:52:27] <whoev> well the remote server
[11:52:33] <whoev> doesn't have to be able to communicate via javascript
[11:52:33] <b-lew> my first element is working just fine
[11:52:35] <whoev> it's a widget
[11:52:48] <Chopps> johnkpaul thanks for the code :D this is what i wanted thought: http://jsfiddle.net/JVHOLiK/FqMuN/2/ but i didnt know how to do what u did, thanks man
[11:52:54] <RandalSchwartz> yeah!  patch in git@ :)
[11:52:57] <johnkpaul> whoev: if you only care about 1 way communication, then yes, the iframe will work
[11:53:00] <Whirl3d> shoky, sorry for the dealy. Thanks for your help also. Here is a fiddle that is a mess, but it's close: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/3J36e/5/
[11:53:02] <shoky> diverdude: make them transparent?  visiblity:hidden
[11:53:02] <johnkpaul> Chopps: no problem! have fun
[11:53:04] <whoev> what a shame
[11:53:08] <whoev> you think there'd be a better sort of
[11:53:11] <whoev> javascript namespace solution
[11:53:12] <smykes> I am looking for the name of the UI interface element that appears in an input box when you enter more than one into it, and the x appears on them so you can delete them, wtf is that called
[11:53:18] <diverdude> shoky: partly transparent
[11:53:26] <johnkpaul> whoev: there is, it's cross origin resource sharing
[11:53:27] <RandalSchwartz> Oops ... please ignore that.
[11:53:28] <whoev> where the remote script can only access information from within the namespace
[11:53:43] <johnkpaul> ?g cross origin resource sharing @ whoev
[11:53:44] <bot-t> whoev, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing - http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/
[11:53:46] * whoev reads
[11:54:20] <smykes> aha
[11:54:25] <smykes> token input
[11:54:39] <whoev> wait, so, you can access and parse/format JSON from another domain without breaking the SOP?
[11:55:17] <johnkpaul> whoev: well, CORS is a standard way of securely disabling the SOP
[11:55:31] <johnkpaul> but it requires both server and client side changes
[11:55:37] <whoev> oh...
[11:55:40] <johnkpaul> basically the server has to have a whitelist
[11:55:43] <johnkpaul> of allowable domains
[11:55:46] <whoev> that xml file?
[11:56:20] <Whirl3d> so close: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/3J36e/7/
[11:56:22] <johnkpaul> whoev: xml file?
[11:56:29] <johnkpaul> it needs to change the headers
[11:56:37] <johnkpaul> to add a new header that gives the whitelist
[11:57:26] <chrispitzer> hey 'yall. I want your recommendations on js test packages.
[11:57:53] <shoky> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/3J36e/8/
[11:57:56] <chrispitzer> My main goal is to have something that can test my files from bash. So something that can test js using node.js or something similar.
[11:58:07] <johnkpaul> chrispitzer: grunt
[11:58:11] <johnkpaul> it's not a unit testing framework
[11:58:11] <chrispitzer> Super bonus points if it can do mock based tests.
[11:58:25] <whoev> the headers of the page loaded on the local domain?
[11:58:29] <johnkpaul> but it has a testrunner for qunit and nodeunit built in
[11:58:35] <johnkpaul> chrispitzer: sinon.js will give you mocks
[11:58:57] <chrispitzer> nice - looking at it
[11:59:22] <johnkpaul> whoev: http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/cross-site-xmlhttprequest-with-cors/
[11:59:40] <Whirl3d> shoky, you rock. Thanks. What was I doing wrong?
[11:59:42] <chrispitzer> johnkpaul: do you know if sinon plays nice with requirejs?
[12:00:18] <johnkpaul> you mean if there's a version that explicitly supprts AMD?
[12:00:20] <shoky> Whirl3d: i think the major thing was that you had:  if (propname.indexOf(pref)) {
[12:00:25] <shoky> instead of  if (propname.indexOf(pref) == 0) {
[12:00:27] <chrispitzer> johnkpaul: yeah
[12:00:34] <johnkpaul> I don't know, but why would you care in your testing environment?
[12:00:59] <shoky> Whirl3d: and i see by your latest fiddle that you were already on top of everything else ;P
[12:01:18] <shoky> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/3J36e/9/
[12:01:25] <chrispitzer> johnkpaul: all the code I'm testing is in amd modules. So if I don't manage dependencies it's hard to load files to test.
[12:01:41] <shoky> Whirl3d: also you had the console.log after the return so .. :)
[12:01:53] <johnkpaul> chrispitzer: you can use AMD for all of your code, but there's no reason not to have sinon loaded globally
[12:02:18] <johnkpaul> you don' thave to worry about the incremental filesize benefit for your tests
[12:03:54] <Whirl3d> Thanks for your help, I am so embarrassed. LOL Now, I get to add another layer of complexity: I have to strip out the "class" properties from the results. So startClass  , endClass, and just class are one object, everything else in the other. LOL
[12:04:09] <shoky> Whirl3d oops the last fiddle was bad. instead: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/3J36e/10/
[12:04:35] <Whirl3d> I thought you were just showing me how indexOf() didin't work without ==0 in it
[12:04:37] <tristan-> can anyone recommend a good plugin for event driven video playback?
[12:05:02] <shoky> ah no it was just my mistake ;)
[12:05:17] <shoky> guess i reloaded without saving or something
[12:13:31] <zerobeholder> I lose. Bah. http://jsfiddle.net/sfNSW/10/ this is the jsfiddle for getting an alternate submit working.
[12:14:01] <zerobeholder> The regular submit works and I was able to get to my processing page from the link at one point in time...
[12:14:42] <zerobeholder> But, it was never right, the owner of this issue is renobird who is still here... I have to head to a meeting...
[12:20:14] <ShaunR> whats the best way to search through a checkbox array and see if any of them are checked?  I just need a true/false type deal
[12:23:09] <danzik171> ShaunR: !!collection.filter( ":checked" ).length
[12:23:13] <jamesdean77> Afetrnoon
[12:24:35] <ShaunR> thanks
[12:26:52] <ShaunR> hmm change() doesnt look to be fired on a input:checkbox when a function checks/unchecks it... is there somthing else i should use?
[12:27:05] <ShaunR> i just need to fire an event if the box is checked/unchecked regardless how it was done.
[12:33:25] <NoiseEee> ShaunR: no events are fired when an input is changed programatically
[12:35:36] <johnkpaul> ShaunR: you can .trigger("change") after you programatically check/uncheck
[12:35:41] <johnkpaul> ?trigger @ShaunR

[13:00:46] <johnkpaul> sparuvu: can you explain what you mean a little more? If you want to retry an ajax call, you can create a new ajax call in your error handler
[13:00:55] <sunbeam> function(response) { this.reset() } this is how i can reset on success right?
[13:01:01] <sunbeam> or how can i best check? when success
[13:01:11] <sunbeam> $.ajax({type: 'POST', url: '/feed/subscribe', data: $('#subscribe').serialize(), success: function(response) {
[13:01:16] <sunbeam> is what i use now
[13:01:39] <Crimlo> thats a pretty shitty code brah
[13:02:03] <sunbeam> Crimlo: how could i write it better
[13:02:12] <vladikoff> Crimlo, please watch your attitude and language, this is your final warning
[13:02:37] <Crimlo> take your warning and shuve it up your ass mister
[13:02:42] <khmer_> bye dude
[13:02:52] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: so inside your callback, this is the ajax config object, not your form
[13:03:02] <sunbeam> ah yes
[13:03:18] <sunbeam> johnkpaul: but, how would i best build a way to check whether it was successfully submittted
[13:03:20] <johnkpaul> inside the callback, do something like $("#form-id").get(0).reset()
[13:03:37] <sunbeam> i don't want it to be reset when there were errors
[13:03:48] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: yes, that's why you'd add that code inside your success callback
[13:04:14] <sunbeam> success just means there was a return right?
[13:04:28] <sunbeam> eg. when there are errors whats in function(response) still gets executed
[13:04:38] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: I don't know what you mean
[13:04:50] <johnkpaul> the success callback is called whenever there is a 200 or 2* response code
[13:05:00] <frfan> http://jsfiddle.net/karlradikarl/pb39Y/4/ i want this to work to many childs.. but i wont to copy the code for any of the childs, which is the best way to handle this? somethin like a number no every id divID001 divIDchild001 or what ever?
[13:05:28] <johnkpaul> frfan: why not just use a class?
[13:07:44] <someprimetime> so does serialize() not serialize input file fields?
[13:07:57] <sunbeam> someprimetime: i think it does
[13:08:02] <BaruchHashem> how can i make my imgs frommy jquery.cycle links?
[13:08:05] <sunbeam> johnkpaul: yes, but so how do i check whether it was ok, "<div>Your form has been submit</div>" (then the form should be reset) or returned "you have errors"
[13:08:11] <johnkpaul> someprimetime: they are not serialized
[13:08:22] <sunbeam> johnkpaul: only text/password/email etc?
[13:08:27] <someprimetime> johnkpaul: know what a workaround would be? i see that ajaxForm() uses the iframe method for this
[13:08:38] <johnkpaul> ?serialize @sunbeam @someprimetime
[13:08:40] <bot-t> johnkpaul, Couldn't find "serialize @sunbeam" in jQuery Docs.
[13:08:51] <someprimetime> but the reason i'm using serialize() is because ajaxForm wasn't working for another reason
[13:08:53] <johnkpaul> aw, bot -t
[13:08:58] <shoky> SIGH
[13:09:02] <johnkpaul> someprimetime: jquery ajax by itself will not let you send a file
[13:09:11] <sparuvu> johnkpaul: hey I am sorry I was not at my desk
[13:09:15] <johnkpaul> someprimetime: I've used this very successfully http://valums.com/ajax-upload/
[13:09:15] <someprimetime> johnkpaul: word thanks i'll look into the iframe method
[13:09:17] <sparuvu> so the situation is
[13:09:27] <johnkpaul> I'm sure there are other plugins, but that's the one that I use someprimetime
[13:09:28] <sparuvu> I have a utility function that returns the
[13:09:33] <someprimetime> johnkpaul: thx
[13:09:42] <sparuvu> ajax deferred object
[13:09:46] <sparuvu> something like
[13:09:49] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: you check whether it was ok by knowing that the success handler was called
[13:09:53] <sparuvu> return $.ajax()
[13:09:56] <johnkpaul> both success and error will not be called, so it dpeends on which one
[13:10:04] <johnkpaul> someprimetime: no problem, have fun
[13:10:16] <sparuvu> now I want my function to return only in the success callback
[13:10:28] <shoky> dum dum dummmmmm
[13:10:36] <johnkpaul> sparuvu: so you want to retry forever?
[13:10:47] <DerekPioneer> how do i filter by htmlc ontent
[13:10:57] <DerekPioneer> something like .filter(':contains(blah)')
[13:10:59] <DerekPioneer> except :html
[13:11:02] <johnkpaul> I actually don't know how to do this using the deferred api easily, but I'm sure it's possible, sparuvu
[13:11:07] <johnkpaul> but you might want to read this http://zeroedandnoughted.com/defensive-ajax-and-ajax-retries-in-jquery/
[13:11:24] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: you can pass filter a function
[13:11:25] <johnkpaul> ?filter
[13:11:25] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[13:11:32] <sparuvu> johnkpaul: thank you
[13:11:33] <sparuvu> :)
[13:11:38] <johnkpaul> sparuvu: no problem
[13:11:50] <someprimetime> hmm any idea why: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#json
[13:11:57] <someprimetime> if you enter anything in double quotes, it gives back an error?
[13:12:01] <someprimetime> e.g. "testing"
[13:12:06] <someprimetime> SyntaxError: Unexpected token y
[13:12:09] <someprimetime> but single quotes works
[13:12:25] <someprimetime> i'm returning an html fragment, so double quotes are necessary
[13:12:28] <johnkpaul> someprimetime: my guess is that it's some annoying php issue
[13:12:38] <someprimetime> johnkpaul: this also happens with python
[13:12:39] <johnkpaul> because of concatenating something with unescaped "
[13:12:40] <someprimetime> we're using pylons
[13:12:40] <sunbeam> johnkpaul: so how would i check that? sorry but i really dont understand how to see difference
[13:12:51] <johnkpaul> someprimetime: add \ and it works fine
[13:12:57] <someprimetime> yeah, i'll do that thjx
[13:13:18] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: you don't necessarily check that after the fact, either one of those two functions are called
[13:13:24] <johnkpaul> if success is called, update your div with the sucecsstext
[13:13:31] <johnkpaul> if the error is called, update your div with your error text
[13:14:42] <sunbeam> johnkpaul: so the only way i can find whether it was good or not is by parsing the returned string from the php script?
[13:15:30] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: your php should be returning a not-success response code
[13:15:32] <johnkpaul> if there was an error
[13:15:34] <sunbeam> anyway, then i know what to do
[13:15:36] <sunbeam> johnkpaul: yes it does
[13:15:38] <johnkpaul> is that not the case?
[13:15:39] <ziggles> Any plugin suggestions for building a horizontal timeline?  Something i could publish a nation's historical events with? (ie overlapping times)
[13:15:46] <sunbeam> johnkpaul: it is
[13:15:54] <sunbeam> johnkpaul: <span class='form_error_text'> Please submit a valid e-mail address<br /> That's not the correct answer for 1 + 9 + 10<br /> </span>
[13:15:58] <johnkpaul> then you don't need to check if it is good or not by parsing the string, if error is called, it means that it is definitely _not_ good
[13:16:54] <sunbeam> yes, but i can only find out whether is AN error by parsing the string
[13:17:01] <sunbeam> sorry i probably misunderstand what you say
[13:17:06] <sunbeam> when i now do:
[13:17:20] <sunbeam> $.ajax({type: 'POST', url: '/feed/subscribe', data: $('#subscribe').serialize(), success: function(response) { alert(response); } );
[13:17:31] <sunbeam> here response gives me
[13:17:37] <sunbeam> <span class='form_error_text'> Please submit a valid e-mail address<br /> That's not the correct answer for 1 + 9 + 10<br /> </span>
[13:17:40] <sunbeam> if bad
[13:17:40] <sunbeam> or
[13:17:53] <sunbeam> <p class="succeed"><span class="ticked">V</span>
[13:17:57] <sunbeam> Subscription done</p>
[13:21:02] <pifantastic> someprimetime: did someone answer your question?
[13:21:12] <someprimetime> pifantastic: yeah i got it thanks
[13:21:15] <someprimetime> bbiaf engr meeting
[13:21:17] <pifantastic> kk
[13:22:47] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: then youw ere incorrect when you said that the response code is an error
[13:22:54] <johnkpaul> when I say response code, I mean the http response code
[13:22:59] <johnkpaul> ?g http response codes @ sunbeam
[13:23:00] <bot-t> sunbeam, HTTP/1.1: Status Code Definitions - http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html
[13:23:07] <johnkpaul> for example, 200, or 404
[13:25:35] <sunbeam> ahh ok
[13:25:36] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: pass your own 'logic' status result in your response:  {'status':'fail', 'statusMsg':'bad email'} versus ('status':'success'}  or something
[13:25:59] <sunbeam> so i should make that response a json object or something?
[13:26:16] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: well presumably you're sending a response??
[13:26:26] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: from the ajax script yes
[13:26:37] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: just what i wrote above
[13:27:04] <sunbeam> johnkpaul: but, i just don't see why my .php script would give another code than the standard code (and why)
[13:27:10] <NoiseEee> so then include whether or not the logic behind the request worked.  'success' in XHR terms is much different than what 'success' might mean to your application.  don't use status codes for your app.
[13:28:48] <BaruchHashem> i am using jquery to access the dom to make my images with .cycle link clickable.  However, because I have to make the cycle images z-index -1 i cant click on them.  if i make the z-index 0 i can click on them but it messes my pagers up. what to do??
[13:29:07] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: but how should i do it then? can you give any example?
[13:30:16] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: i *gave* you an example
[13:31:10] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: i mean, how can i create such in my php script?
[13:31:40] <Brodingo> BaruchHashem give your pager a higher zindex?
[13:31:47] <BaruchHashem> tried, doesnt workk
[13:32:06] <Brodingo> ?demo @ BaruchHashem
[13:32:07] <bot-t> BaruchHashem, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:32:45] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: {'status':'fail', 'statusMsg':'bad email'} - should be like a json array?
[13:33:19] <johnkpaul> NoiseEee: why don't you like using http status codes?
[13:34:17] <johnkpaul> I know that REST is hipster nowadays, but I think that it's helpful to maintain semantically correct http response codes
[13:34:47] <sunbeam> johnkpaul: but bare in mind, this result is coming from a subscribeformcontroller
[13:34:57] <sunbeam> which basically does
[13:35:02] <sunbeam> if($validform) { $this->registry->template->show('subscribe_success'); }
[13:35:17] <sunbeam> where function show() does include 'subscribe_success.php';
[13:35:37] <sunbeam> what should i do with this? get the contents of that include, put it in an array
[13:35:43] <NoiseEee> johnkpaul: i don't like to use http status codes when the app logic has failed.
[13:35:51] <NoiseEee> johnkpaul: i leave http status codes for server status
[13:35:58] <johnkpaul> that's what bad request is for, NoiseEee
[13:36:00] <sunbeam> $result['html'] = '<div>good</div>';  and $result['status'] = 'good'; ?
[13:36:03] <Narsil> Hi, I'd like to report a bug in jquery, how can I do that ? (The bug is related to keydown events on the iphone safari.)
[13:36:05] <johnkpaul> 400 Bad Request
[13:36:07] <NoiseEee> johnkpaul: i suppose
[13:36:12] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: and then json it and return it?
[13:36:39] <BaruchHashem> fixed it: just made the pager button position relative and higehr z index
[13:36:46] <NoiseEee> johnkpaul: but my habitual way of doing it allows you to pass reasons, etc etc in another parameter
[13:39:22] <johnkpaul> NoiseEee: I just think it's useful because then you get these clientside features for free
[13:39:27] <johnkpaul> for example, jquery's ajax error handlign
[13:39:29] <johnkpaul> handling*
[13:40:15] <sunbeam> anyone can help me ?
[13:40:51] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: this is zend or something?
[13:41:07] <sunbeam> johnkpaul: no just some custom code
[13:41:22] <johnkpaul> if you want to use NoiseEee's method, you ned to add a new property in your response
[13:41:30] <johnkpaul> that contains the error and the error message
[13:41:37] <sunbeam> johnkpaul: yes, thats what i fgured
[13:41:41] <sunbeam> but that should be a json array or something?
[13:41:41] <silverwind> Just use HTTP already...
[13:41:55] <johnkpaul> if you want to use mine, you need to add the header("HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request");
[13:42:09] <sunbeam> ok, is that semantically better?
[13:42:13] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: that should be wherever you need it to be, to check it in your success callback
[13:42:30] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: IMHO, it makes more sense, but feel free to use what you are able to
[13:43:00] <sunbeam> i have that subscribe_view included, so i cannot put it in an array and then the status code in another value (of the same array(
[13:43:07] <sunbeam> unless you say this is not true
[13:43:27] <sunbeam> i mean subscribe_success.php view sorry
[13:43:45] <austinallen> How many plugins do you guys use?
[13:44:00] <austinallen> I hear its not recommended to use many plugins at all
[13:44:03] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: this is very difficult to answer without knowing something about your backend and php, perhaps ask ##php?
[13:44:21] <johnkpaul> I'd try to add that new header into the code that decides taht there's an error
[13:44:34] <sunbeam> yes, but header() redirects a page
[13:44:44] <sunbeam> right?
[13:45:44] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: only header("Location: http://etc");  http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php  ##php
[13:45:49] <sunbeam> nvm sorry
[13:46:04] <sunbeam> ehm it works now, but it doesn't include the content anymore
[13:46:19] <sunbeam> while i still need to know what errors there were
[13:46:39] <austinallen> sunbeam: ##php Will be the best option :)
[13:46:48] <chilversc_> sunbeam: yeah, because the content is only ment to describe the redirection to clients that don't handle 303 correctly
[13:47:16] <chilversc_> sunbeam: so javascript will follow the redirect and fetch the page at that location
[13:48:03] <sunbeam> so what does this mean? that with using header("HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request"); i cannot return any content?
[13:48:12] <chilversc_> 400 bad request can return content
[13:48:27] <sunbeam> oh wait sorry it does
[13:48:30] <chilversc_> I use 400 Bad Request all the time when I get and error, and place the details in the body as json
[13:48:35] <sunbeam> just the jquery function stops at that point
[13:49:18] <chilversc_> sunbeam: you need to set up an error handler, eg, $.ajax({error: function(xhr, ...) { ... }});
[13:49:44] <sunbeam> chilversc_: ok, after success function? or doesn't that matter
[13:50:06] <chilversc_> sunbeam: or alternativly use the new statusCode block; $.ajax({statusCode: {400: function(...
[13:50:31] <chilversc_> sunbeam: doesn't matter, it runs instead of success, and complete always runs, see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ for details
[13:51:11] <sunbeam> chilversc_: ok thanks a lot
[13:52:07] <silverwind> What is his error?
[13:52:18] <silverwind> Is is really a 400?
[13:52:18] * chilversc hates servers that don't use an error code when something goes wrong
[13:52:40] <chilversc> so much more annoying to code against because it doesn't trigger standard error handlers in the client
[13:52:43] <sunbeam> silverwind: its when the user filled in no or incorrect values in a form
[13:52:47] <DerekPioneer> how do i write a selector that wouldn't match "118 - ivory" filter(':contains("18 - Ivory")')
[13:52:58] <DerekPioneer> i need :contains to have something like ^ in regex
[13:52:59] <NoiseEee> good point chilversc
[13:53:05] <chilversc> sunbeam: I'd probably hunt through the 4xx codes to see if anything is better, but 400 is fine as a generic error code
[13:53:18] <silverwind> sunbeam, Ah, then yeah, it would be a bad request
[13:53:43] <chilversc> still trying to work out how to slip status code 418 in to an app
[13:53:50] <johnkpaul> :)
[13:53:57] <johnkpaul> I'm glad that I'm getting consensus
[13:54:22] <adamSs> howdy folks
[13:54:24] <NoiseEee> indeed i shall probably change my old ways
[13:54:37] <chilversc> I think the main problem is people using $.get and $.post shortcuts and not knowing about the full featured $.ajax
[13:55:16] <sunbeam> chilversc: so using $.ajax for forms is best practice atm?
[13:55:46] <silverwind> sunbeam, It's just a way like another..
[13:55:49] <int_64> hi, is there a better way to call animate on images and have the effect actually be smooth and professional?
[13:55:54] <chilversc> sunbeam: normally I'd say yes, the $.post/$.get shortcuts are only really for when you don't care about errors
[13:55:55] <sunbeam> chilversc: http://pastebin.ca/2142307 this is what i use now
[13:55:59] <int_64> It is VERY choppy for me
[13:56:03] <chilversc> or you have some sort of global error handler that kicks in
[13:56:15] <silverwind> chilversc, Don't .post and .get return promises?
[13:56:30] <chilversc> silverwind: maybe now, I'm not using that version yet
[13:56:33] <silverwind> Ahh
[13:56:52] <johnkpaul> I use .get and .post fairly frequently actually, you can still override all of the options
[13:56:57] <johnkpaul> it's just in a different place in the arguments
[13:58:11] <silverwind> johnkpaul, if you use the promise-way, it's pretty much the same everywhere
[13:58:14] <chilversc> aww, twitter had to go and invent their own status code when there's a perfectly good draft already in place
[13:58:49] <johnkpaul> silverwind: .get and .post return deferreds too
[13:58:55] <silverwind> $.someAjaxMethod({configurationHere}).done(function(data) {}).fail(function(){}).always(function(){});
[13:58:57] <chilversc> see, I'm pondering if 422 - Unprocessable Entity would be sutible for forms that fail validation
[13:59:07] <silverwind> johnkpaul, Yeah :)
[13:59:14] <int_64> Anybody here pretty well aquainted with animate() and tweaking it to look smooth?
[13:59:35] <adamSs> Hey people! I'm trying to get my first onclick event working. I poset it here: http://jsfiddle.net/rZZmm/  Would anyone mind looking to see if there is anything blatantly wrong? it's not working.
[13:59:53] <johnkpaul> chilversc: it depends on why it fails, no?
[13:59:55] <sunbeam> chilversc: any thing you can recommend me to better use?
[14:00:48] <sunbeam> i don't get why it doesn't change those css values and fills that html
[14:00:58] <sunbeam> like return false; took place
[14:01:11] <chilversc> johnkpaul: dunno, 422 is a generic status code still, so it doesn't say why it failed, only that the server understood the media type, but failed due to semantic issues
[14:01:23] <chilversc> which sounds like form validation failing, ie semantic issues with the data
[14:01:45] <johnkpaul> yeah, that makes sense
[14:01:49] <johnkpaul> if it was syntax issues, that'd be 400

[14:07:10] <sphinxxx> johnkpaul:  can i suggest adding this to ?gzip ,   http://gzipwtf.com
[14:08:03] <chilversc> sunbeam: it doesn't, you were just hooking the success handler in the past, so your callback was only executed on success, which is a 2xx status code
[14:08:37] <chilversc> sunbeam: as for that network error thing, that's just how the web console displays it, to let you know something didn't work
[14:09:09] <chilversc> it gets a little over-zelous I find, since it can't tell between an unexpected failure due to say, a missing resource, and an expected one that is handled
[14:10:48] <sunbeam> it does, i use a error: response

[14:14:04] <Parhs> ok guys..
[14:14:05] <chilversc> sunbeam: check the docs for $.ajax, take note of the error handler, its method signature is different
[14:14:30] <Parhs> http://parhs.no-ip.org/services/synergy-workstation for example.. look at main.js file firebug
[14:14:30] <chilversc> sunbeam: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:15:32] <NoiseEee> Parhs: nobody is wading through code for you.  post your problem as a reduced case jsfiddle
[14:15:51] <Parhs> it is imposible
[14:15:57] <Parhs> the line is 367
[14:16:06] <Parhs> with firebug it is very easy to find it
[14:16:58] <shoky> .filter, not .find
[14:17:28] <Parhs> thanks filter did the magic:)
[14:17:47] <winux> how would i go about placing errors from the jquery validator into an alert box once errors have been found?
[14:21:01] <shoky> which part of that is giving you trouble
[14:21:05] <shoky> @winux
[14:21:26] <winux> shoky: specifically i need to check if a particular error for a field was thrown, and handle it in a custom fashion
[14:22:37] <winux> shoky: so i call validator().. and let's say a field called first_name is missing .. i want to be able to call a function to do something after the missing field has been discovered
[14:22:51] <shoky> dunno validator sry. thought you said you already had the error
[14:23:20] <shoky> isn't that basic functionality of a validator?
[14:23:32] <winux> not really, or that I've seen
[14:23:42] <winux> i might hack up errorPlacement but i think there might be a better way
[14:23:47] <sunbeam> chilversc: how do you mean method signature? sorry dont undrestand
[14:26:13] <chilversc> sunbeam: I suppose signature is technically the wrong term here since javascript doesn't have typed arguments to a function
[14:26:38] <chilversc> sunbeam: but what I mean, is the method arguments to the error callback are different to the method arguments to the success callback
[14:27:04] <sunbeam> ok
[14:27:21] <Whirl3d> so, inside a javascript function like: function doSomething(props) {this.props=props}; Can I then use var test= new doSomething({apples:"red"}); and then test.props={oranges:"orange"}; to change it's props or is props a private member of the function
[14:28:18] <sunbeam> chilversc: error:function (xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError) like this?
[14:28:27] <chilversc> sunbeam: eg, it doesn't automatically parse the data for you (since the data could be in error)
[14:28:33] <chilversc> sunbeam: right
[14:28:37] <shoky> winux: i see you can set an 'invalidHandler' callback
[14:28:42] <chilversc> sunbeam: compare that to the success call back
[14:29:22] <sunbeam> ok
[14:29:32] <sunbeam> but when i only can use those 3 argument, where can i put response?
[14:29:44] <mordof> Whirl3d: that's what you should use prototypes for
[14:29:55] <mordof> well
[14:29:58] <mordof> not that specifically
[14:30:08] <mordof> if you started adding methods to that you'd want to use prototypes
[14:30:12] <pifantastic> ?tias @ Whirl3d
[14:30:13] <bot-t> Whirl3d, Try It And See
[14:30:54] <pifantastic> ?eval var Foo = function(props) { for (var prop in props) { this[prop] = props[prop]; } }; var bar = new Foo({
[14:30:57] <mordof> pifantastic: that's a bad thing to respond with that actually, because it would work, but not the way expected
[14:30:57] <pifantastic> crap
[14:30:58] <bot-t> pifantastic: SyntaxError: invalid property id
[14:31:00] <winux> shoky: sounds like a step in the right path
[14:31:09] <mordof> Whirl3d: it would not respond how you're thinking it would, no
[14:31:09] <Whirl3d> pifantastic, nice...however you and I both know that as obtuse of a question as I was asking, the possible variations would be endless
[14:31:37] <mordof> er, sec
[14:31:39] <pifantastic> ?eval var Foo = function(props) { for (var prop in props) { this[prop] = props[prop]; } }; var bar = new Foo({"boom": "bam"}); bar.boom;
[14:31:41] <bot-t> pifantastic: "bam"
[14:31:47] <mordof> hm
[14:31:54] <pifantastic> Yeah, I really dont know what you're trying to accomplish
[14:32:01] <mordof> ok, i was thinking of another scenario, heh
[14:32:40] <shoky> Whirl3d there are no private members
[14:32:49] <mordof> unless you use closures :D
[14:32:59] <Whirl3d> I'm trying to figure out which are publicly exposed methods when creativing a javascript object that I want to turn into a plugin...
[14:33:02] <Whirl3d> thanks.
[14:33:03] <pifantastic> well, it already is a closure if you're using `new`
[14:33:06] <shoky> still not private
[14:33:12] <StevenCodes> join ##pl1
[14:33:17] <StevenCodes> oops sorry
[14:33:39] <pifantastic> Whirl3d: there are some great write ups on JS patterns that can help you with thus
[14:33:40] <Whirl3d> creativing? lol
[14:33:41] <pifantastic> this*

[14:34:30] <Whirl3d> Thanks a ton. I will read up on them right now. I'm trying to encapsulate an animation preset as a reusable object
[14:34:33] <pifantastic> You probabl ywant somethign similar to http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript
[14:34:47] <frfan> how to fix jquery mobile's fixed footer?
[14:34:51] <pifantastic> oh, in that case, maybe not module patterns
[14:35:03] <sunbeam> chilversc: nvm sorry i should read better
[14:35:11] <sunbeam> working like it should
[14:35:31] <sunbeam> chilversc and johnkpaul-afk do you also advice to use it like on more complex forms? eg. submitting a long list or blog post?
[14:35:43] <sunbeam> returning such header?
[14:36:26] <chilversc> sunbeam: I do, though partial success gets a bit more complicated, http doesn't have a nice way to deal with that
[14:36:44] <chilversc> well, http as most browsers use it
[14:37:40] <zduffy> Im assuming this is the wrong syntax: http://pastebin.com/KGXaZ0b7 Can someone help me?
[14:38:26] <Eviltwin> If you view source, what do you see?
[14:38:36] <sunbeam> zduffy: use $('select option:contains(<?php echo $customer[State'] ?>)').val();
[14:38:41] <sunbeam> zduffy: use $('select option:contains(<?php echo $customer["State"] ?>)').val();
[14:38:55] <sunbeam> oh wait
[14:38:59] <sunbeam> sorry misread
[14:39:03] <chilversc> zduffy: not sure, but shouldn't the argument to contains be quoted? worth a try since its simple
[14:39:54] <chilversc> ah no, can be bare word, well that's that one scuppled
[14:40:02] <silverwind> Seeing mixed JS and PHP makes me vomit
[14:40:11] <shoky> ^
[14:40:21] <zduffy> single or double quoted?
[14:40:37] <chilversc> zduffy: text must have matching case according to the docs though
[14:40:43] <chilversc> does the case match?
[14:40:48] <zduffy> Yes sir
[14:41:09] <zduffy> silverwind: How would you accomplish that then
[14:41:10] <shoky> zduffy how about answering Eviltwin's question
[14:41:34] <zduffy> shoky: I didn't know that was directed to me
[14:41:41] * paul_irish _o/\o_ shoky
[14:41:42] <shoky> k ;) now you do
[14:41:48] <shoky> hey pauly
[14:41:59] <shoky> you got html5rocks.com to rock again!
[14:41:59] <paul_irish> hey baby
[14:42:00] <bot-t> (7 hours 30 mins ago) <miketaylr> tell paul_irish that's great news!
[14:42:08] <paul_irish> totes rockin. was something broken?
[14:42:08] <shoky> kudos props & attrs
[14:42:26] <shoky> hmm it was broken on chrome dev a while ago
[14:42:36] <zduffy> Eviltwin: var statee = $('select option:contains()').val();
[14:42:44] <shoky> derp
[14:42:46] <paul_irish> oh.
[14:42:56] <paul_irish> yay for fixxd
[14:43:09] <shoky> you be man o' men
[14:43:30] <paul_irish> <3z
[14:44:22] <shoky> zduffy: that doesn't look suspicious to you?
[14:46:05] <zduffy> shoky: Of course it does?
[14:46:18] <shoky> im sure of it???
[14:46:30] <zduffy> Maybe I need to assign a variable and put that variable in contains?
[14:46:40] * shoky squints
[14:46:55] <shoky> your php snippet shouldn't be empty, no?
[14:47:02] <shoky> its output, that is
[14:47:54] <pifantastic> zduffy: your PHP echo statement is empty
[14:48:00] <pifantastic> the javascript is fine
[14:48:10] <zduffy> Fixed it.. It needed double quotes. Thanks guys
[14:48:22] <shoky> yay?!
[14:50:45] <zduffy> Ive been stuck in VB6 mode for about 6 months, then switched back to web? Hard to move back and forth lol
[14:50:45] <zduffy> k
[14:52:12] <shoky> VB6? 2012?
[14:54:28] <polygon-pusher> Looking for some input on my code. I have a lengthy bit of code for a animation. Heres the code http://jsfiddle.net/n9xax/ heres the finished product http://what-a-ya-nuts.spryplayground.com/
[14:54:54] <polygon-pusher> I'm a noob at js so feel free to tell me its all wrong
[14:55:03] <shoky> anything specific?
[14:55:16] <polygon-pusher> well thats just it I wouldnt know if there is
[14:55:31] <polygon-pusher> maybe just comment on my code style
[14:55:34] <shoky> the site looks nice and responds well
[14:55:43] <polygon-pusher> thanks
[14:55:50] <polygon-pusher> anything bad you see about though
[14:56:03] <polygon-pusher> looking for negatives
[14:56:30] <shoky> midpoint = stageW >> 1;    seriously? :)
[14:56:35] <polygon-pusher> also what do you think about a 2mb load for the images
[14:56:43] <polygon-pusher> bitwise if faster then /
[14:57:01] <johnsolo> premature optimization
[14:57:03] <polygon-pusher> or at least it is in js
[14:57:05] <shoky> if stageW is a float, maybe
[14:57:07] <polygon-pusher> as3
[14:57:12] <johnsolo> also you should look into using classes instead of IDs for everything
[14:57:38] <shoky> polygon-pusher: you're writing a javascript app, not an embedded real-time microchip
[14:57:47] <polygon-pusher> :)
[14:57:57] <shoky> write / 2. cause then people who donno bitwise can read it too
[14:58:05] <shoky> and it's more expressive of whats going on
[14:58:11] <shoky> if you wanna talk about code style ;)
[14:58:14] <polygon-pusher> ok you when there
[14:58:20] <polygon-pusher> win*
[14:58:22] <johnsolo> code is read more than it is written
[14:58:30] <johnsolo> optimize for the read case.
[14:59:16] <shoky> way too much JS stuff that should be CSS
[14:59:19] <polygon-pusher> what about the general size of the code and images. Do you think thats over the top?
[14:59:57] <shoky> too much JS code yes
[15:00:10] <polygon-pusher> shoky: I agree but if I moved the reset css code into css how would you call it to reset?
[15:02:47] <polygon-pusher> thanks for looking guys
[15:03:24] <Whirl3d> polygon-pusher, can't you just write a plugint hat stores the various states of the elements in their data objects and then animates to those states when needed?
[15:03:27] <polygon-pusher> I'm gonna see what I can do to bring most of the css into css
[15:03:47] <shoky> Whirl3d: trying to get him to do your work for you??
[15:04:12] <Whirl3d> No, I'm trying to do his work for him
[15:04:13] <Whirl3d> lol
[15:04:15] <polygon-pusher> what do you mean by a plugin?
[15:04:25] <shoky> polygon-pusher: if it's for initialization after animation then maybe i was too harsh with the JS/CSS thing
[15:04:28] <Whirl3d> you gotta admit that my plan would make his code easy to read/write
[15:04:57] <shoky> well yea
[15:05:03] <shoky> and i was kidding ;P
[15:05:29] <Whirl3d> ikr, I was smiling when I wrote that, btw
[15:05:36] <Whirl3d> it was nice of you to notice...
[15:05:37] <Whirl3d> lol
[15:05:46] <LazyTown> If I load content via ajax and display it in a modal dialog is $.ready() function ran on the newly loaded content?
[15:05:51] <shoky> ;>
[15:06:51] <Whirl3d> polygon-pusher, the rule of thumb that I try to use is this: If I am repeating the same action in my code more than twice, even the same line of code more than twice, it's time to evaluate if there is a way to make it more "modular" or abstract it so that it applies to more than just one element.
[15:07:11] <LazyTown> I dont know why but none of my binding is working in my ajax loaded dialogs.
[15:07:20] <Whirl3d> For example, in your code, you have hideRedBad and hideGoldBag and hideOtherBag...that's basically, hideBag(color)
[15:07:50] <polygon-pusher> so maybe I make an object with the values and then make just one function and pass it the object kinda thing?
[15:08:11] <Whirl3d> Sure. then store that object in the data object of the dom element and you are set
[15:08:41] <polygon-pusher> I can see that working
[15:08:49] <polygon-pusher> thanks
[15:08:55] <Whirl3d> you setup a function that says, animate my object to this state and it looks up the stateconfig on your object if it's missing, it uses the default.
[15:09:50] <Whirl3d> If I can focus long enough to get my plugin done, I'll let you try it out. It's a great way of doing exactly what you need. But don't count on me, I'm easliy distracted.
[15:10:18] <polygon-pusher> I will keep an eye out for it
[15:11:09] <thomasgriffin> Can someone tell me why the top code fails but the bottom code works? https://gist.github.com/580e1f25bc8c9bbe9189
[15:11:33] <thomasgriffin> code is run within jQuery(document).ready(function($){
[15:12:31] <thomasgriffin> basically I want to show/hide someting on load and show/hide div when a user changes the selection
[15:12:46] <thomasgriffin> problem is, on page load, it shows the div even if the correct option is selected

[15:23:01] <Bankzilla> Sanden:
[15:23:19] <shoky> IE will always do bad things
[15:23:47] <Sanden> shoky: yes, I know. They tell me it's "job security"
[15:24:23] <shoky> what is
[15:24:31] <Sanden> tripwire magazine has a conglomeration of about 50 carousels
[15:24:41] <shoky> ;S
[15:24:57] <Sanden> shoky: the fact that I have to continually code for IE then hack around it to make every other browser look reasonable
[15:25:41] <Bankzilla> your doing it wrong, code for every other browser then hack IE
[15:25:51] <shoky> i dont think 50 carousels would look reasonable in any browser
[15:26:52] <Sanden> Banksy: sadly, IE is the browser of choice... erm.. demand.. of PeopleSoft/Oracle.
[15:28:03] <waltercon> what is wrong with $post
[15:28:16] <waltercon> why does it keep saying success when i put success = false in my json
[15:28:22] <shoky> ?
[15:29:37] <waltercon> i put in my json
[15:29:41] <waltercon> success = false
[15:29:44] <shoky> in what json
[15:29:44] <waltercon> i see it in firefox

[15:29:55] <waltercon> from my $post
[15:29:57] <waltercon> to a page
[15:29:59] <waltercon> then

[15:30:24] <waltercon> $.post man
[15:30:41] <shoky> learn to phrase your sentences, man
[15:30:45] <shoky> i have no idea what your issue is

[15:31:05] <waltercon> even tho i put in error = true

[15:31:25] <shoky> Er.
[15:31:29] <waltercon> do u even know what $post is
[15:31:30] <shoky> that was @ waltercon ;\
[15:31:39] <shoky> i thought it was $.post
[15:31:48] <waltercon> do u
[15:31:49] <waltercon> or not
[15:31:56] <shoky> i know $.post, yes
[15:32:06] <waltercon> do u know the success event callback?
[15:32:08] <shoky> you dont post any results to any page
[15:32:13] <shoky> yes, i do
[15:32:24] <waltercon> why does that keep getting triggered
[15:32:34] <shoky> i imagine the request is successful
[15:32:35] <waltercon> even though the response is success= false
[15:32:44] <shoky> WTF is success=false??
[15:32:50] <shoky> that's not even json
[15:32:57] <waltercon> thats what i put in my json
[15:33:02] <waltercon> omg
[15:33:03] <Bankzilla> lol
[15:33:08] <shoky> IN WHAT JSON
[15:33:13] <Bankzilla> give us your code
[15:33:14] <shoky> what are you doing with this json
[15:33:19] <waltercon> {"msg":"Saved ok","error":true}
[15:33:20] <waltercon> this
[15:33:27] <shoky> why should a 'success' property of your json have any effect on anything?
[15:33:37] <waltercon> trying to make the success event not fire
[15:33:42] <waltercon> and make the error event fire
[15:33:48] <shoky> then you're doing it wrong
[15:33:50] <waltercon> how do i do some shit on the server side
[15:33:53] <shoky> who told you to do success=false
[15:33:54] <shoky> wtf
[15:33:57] <Bankzilla> why would you want the error event to fire
[15:33:57] <waltercon> throw an error
[15:34:03] <waltercon> and get it to show error results
[15:34:06] <waltercon> with $.post

[15:34:22] <waltercon> cause i do server side validation
[15:34:24] <shoky> if you dont want the success callback called, then make sure your server doesnt respond with a success code
[15:34:40] <waltercon> wtf
[15:34:51] <waltercon> are u serious
[15:34:55] <shoky> are u?
[15:34:56] <waltercon> thats not how its suppose to work
[15:35:00] <shoky> its not?
[15:35:06] <Bankzilla> i think hes trolling?
[15:35:07] <shoky> how is it supposed to work?
[15:35:13] <shoky> maybe
[15:35:21] <shoky> but he seems agitated enough to not be a troll
[15:35:41] <shoky> you never know tho
[15:35:59] <RandalSchwartz> the way to get it not to fire is to not wire it up in the first place :)
[15:36:13] <waltercon> well
[15:36:16] <RandalSchwartz> but perhaps he's using someone else's code.
[15:36:21] <shoky> ah you beat me to it, RandalSchwartz!
[15:36:21] <waltercon> is there are prob with jquer 1.4.1
[15:36:21] <Bankzilla> waltercon: no matter what parameters you send through, if the server returns. Success will fire
[15:36:25] <waltercon> with psot or somtehing?
[15:36:34] <waltercon> are u serious>?
[15:36:46] <shoky> waltercon: what r u on
[15:36:46] <waltercon> there is gotta be a way to read the value then?
[15:36:49] <RandalSchwartz> that's what success means. :)
[15:36:49] <shoky> what value
[15:37:05] <waltercon> i thought u can get an error to fire if u send error = true
[15:37:10] <shoky> no, you cant
[15:37:15] <shoky> why did you think that?
[15:37:38] * RandalSchwartz grimaces at "u", but doesn't have time to fight that
[15:37:49] * RandalSchwartz resorts to a drive-by grimace
[15:38:11] <waltercon> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6623600/jquery-not-return-any-status-like-success-failed-completed
[15:38:15] <shoky> get with the times gramps
[15:38:22] <waltercon> what is this post on about then?
[15:38:50] <shoky> asp.net mvc?
[15:39:21] <waltercon> ya
[15:39:25] <shoky> waltercon:  his success callback is also being called
[15:39:34] <shoky> dont you see he's checking that 'success' flag INSIDE the sucess callback
[15:39:40] <waltercon> how do u make the error one called
[15:39:46] <shoky> WHAT
[15:39:46] <Bankzilla> return false;
[15:40:01] <waltercon> but i want to send a message
[15:40:06] <waltercon> with the error status
[15:40:14] <shoky> go ahead
[15:40:25] <shoky> read it INSIDE your success callback
[15:40:33] <waltercon> ok
[15:40:38] <waltercon> so its gonna be success no matter what?
[15:40:39] <shoky> becuase if there is a reply, then the request is SUCCESSful
[15:40:52] <shoky> if the HTTP request is successful its gonna be success
[15:40:55] <waltercon> doesnt matter if i put success= false
[15:40:56] <waltercon> ?
[15:40:58] <Bankzilla> you'll only get a error message if a response isn't received
[15:40:58] <shoky> no
[15:41:00] <Bankzilla> NO
[15:41:01] <Bankzilla> omg
[15:41:10] <waltercon> ok thanks
[15:41:43] <shoky> waltercon: read the official api docs, not some answer on stackoverflow that you dont understand
[15:41:51] <shoky> and if you dont understand the api docs, we're here to help
[15:42:31] <shoky> yea that might've been a troll ;\
[15:42:51] <waltercon> how do i redirect to another page in jquery?
[15:43:01] <shoky> window.location.href = 'url'

[15:55:39] <]Darker[> hi
[15:57:35] <]Darker[> guys I have a little problem: I am using jquery touchswipe on my website but the plugin (that works ok for swipe functions) disable also the pinch-to-zoom functionalities. Do you have experienced the same problem or do u know any plugin that I could use in sostitution to touchswipe that support swipe functionalities but does not prevent zoom? Thanks :)
[16:00:17] <Bankzilla> ]Darker[ wouldn't your question be more directed towards #jquerymobile?
[16:13:12] <Whirl3d> so I have three functions that return separate deferred promises. I call the first one like: hideBlur().done(functions2).don(function3).done(someotherfunc). I can't test at the moment, does that look right or do I have nest all the done calls?
[16:13:49] <Whirl3d> ?.when
[16:13:49] <bot-t> jQuery.when(deferreds): Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[16:14:28] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, I tried to understand .pipe, but it just went over my head at the moment.
[16:14:40] <shoky> Whirl3d: .done(function2, function3, someOtherfunc)
[16:15:08] <shoky> an array of functions is also fine
[16:15:14] <Whirl3d> each function returns it's own deferred promise
[16:15:21] <shoky> uhm
[16:15:27] <Whirl3d> so one happens, then when it's deferred is resolved, the next one happens
[16:15:39] <shoky> .done() returns the original deferred
[16:15:54] <shoky> so what you wrote is equivalent to what i wrote, i think
[16:16:18] <shoky> yeah you wanna use pipe
[16:16:21] <shoky> sec
[16:17:07] <Whirl3d> if you could pull out the core of pipe and explain it to me I can go from there. Unfortunately, I just didin't understand a lot of the language in the api
[16:17:23] <shoky> hideBlur().pipe(function2).pipe(function3)
[16:17:24] <shoky> i think
[16:17:26] <shoky> sec.
[16:18:30] <sunbeam> In many sites you currently see that the header servers as an iframe (eg. the header will stay on the same location) - is there some jquery plugin that i can use to achieve this behavior?
[16:19:24] <shoky> yeah Whirl3d just pipe instead of done
[16:22:56] <Whirl3d> I know johnkpaul wouldn't steer me wrong, but what on earth is with the confusing description?
[16:26:06] <Whirl3d> if you look at the chain tasks example, I'm like huh?
[16:27:16] <Whirl3d> so, .pipe basically substitutes a deferred/promise for the deferred or promise that is supposed to be resolved
[16:27:40] <Whirl3d> without resolving the original deferred?
[16:27:56] <Whirl3d> permanently or just this once?
[16:28:15] <shoky> the original is resolved either way
[16:28:25] <shoky> when it is resolved, the piped function is called,
[16:28:49] <Whirl3d> how is that different from .done
[16:29:24] <shoky> if the piped function returns a deferred/promise (as is in your case) then the .pipe() call will return a NEW promise with the same resolve/reject status as the one you returned from the function
[16:30:26] <shoky> with .done() you can't chain because it returns the original deferred
[16:31:02] <Whirl3d> OOOOHHH...
[16:31:30] <Whirl3d> Lightbulb.....shoky, thank you so much for your patience. I think I get it finally.
[16:31:37] <shoky> so you'd have to :   deferred.done( function() {  function2().done( function() {  function3()..............
[16:31:40] <shoky> i suppose
[16:31:45] <shoky> np
[16:33:50] <shoky> ( pipe() always returns a new promise, but if your piped function doesn't return a deferred/promise then that new returned promise will instantly resolve )
[16:38:55] <shoky> ?js $.fn.jquery
[16:38:57] <bot-t> shoky: "1.4.2"
[16:43:40] <systemfault> Welcome a year and a half ago..
[16:43:49] <systemfault> (If not more)
[16:44:41] <Whirl3d> why would the console in chrome refuse to show a div in jsfiddle. I type console.log($("#slideA")) and it says null.
[16:45:16] <shoky> cause jquery is only included inside the view iframe
[16:45:33] <shoky> not on the main jsfiddle window
[16:46:47] <shoky> Whirl3d: if you choose 'jQuery (edge)'  then you can check 'firebug lite' and get an embedded console in jsfiddle ;p
[16:46:54] <starsinmypockets> I'm having a nasty bug... $('#tabs').tabs(); isn't creating the proper tabs... No errors thrown... $('#tabs').hide() works as expected..  There are multiple instances of jquery loading (only 1 version of jquery ui) but I have a hunch the wrong version of one of the libraries is creating a conflict..
[16:46:54] <shoky> and you'll have jquery access there inside the iframe
[16:46:58] <Whirl3d> but I can type console.log($) and it shows jquery
[16:46:59] <starsinmypockets> Any thoughts how to proceed?
[16:47:08] <Whirl3d> right on. Will do
[16:47:11] <xec> you can append show/ to the url to get the view in browser window
[16:47:16] <shoky> Whirl3d: it shows something, but that's not jquery
[16:48:52] <gnacer> hey everyone, can anyone help with what would be an extremely simple question?
[16:48:55] <xec> starsinmypockets: is your site live somewhere?
[16:49:27] <gnacer> in a manner of speaking
[16:49:31] <xec> ?ask @ gnacer
[16:49:31] <bot-t> gnacer, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:49:31] <starsinmypockets> xec unfortunately the problem is behind authentication
[16:50:10] <starsinmypockets> Is there an easy way to tell (using chrome web tools) where a jquery instance is being loaded from?
[16:50:20] <gnacer> How can I have a tab using the UI widget just open a link in a new window instead of calling up a div on the same page
[16:51:04] <xec> starsinmypockets: you can check the version, and with breakpoints you can step out and see where the originating code is
[16:53:26] <shoky> hmm
[16:54:23] <shoky> if there's some function, called blah, can i somehow, from the console, call blah + step-debug it
[16:55:03] <shoky> i guess most natural would be  debug( blah() ) or something
[16:56:55] <xec> not sure, you might be able to wrap the call in your own function and put a debugger statement in it or something like that
[16:57:11] <shoky> ahh
[16:57:18] <shoky> lets try
[16:57:34] <xec> never tried tbh
[16:58:33] <shoky> yeah  works great
[16:58:36] <shoky> thanx :D
[16:58:43] <shoky> (function() { debugger; func(); })()
[16:58:54] <xec> right
[16:58:56] <gnacer> any takers on the tab question hehe :)
[16:59:05] <xec> cool
[17:01:35] <xec> gnacer: i don't think i understood the question, doesn't opening a link in a new window sort of defeat the entire purpose of the tabs plugin?
[17:02:24] <shoky> you can do whatever you want in the 'show' callback when a tab is shown
[17:02:32] <gnacer> I have the some content that is specifically for the tabs, but there are some elements I want a pop up window to open up for
[17:02:45] <shoky> or bind your own click handler and do whatever you want in there
[17:03:00] <shoky> elements inside the tab?
[17:04:01] <gnacer> Thanks Shoky, I will try that.
[17:04:47] <gnacer> how can I isolate 1 tab to bind the tabsshow event to?
[17:05:34] <shoky> check the ui parameter
[17:05:49] <shoky> you bind to all of them, make the filtering inside
[17:06:07] <xec> if you use events from the tabs plugin
[17:06:30] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[17:06:34] <shoky> HaLu
[17:06:44] <xec> hei
[17:06:52] <ProLoser|Work> i'm working on a plugin and i'm trying to fix a sizing bug when the element is initially hidden: https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2/issues/53
[17:06:53] <socialhapy>  Issue #53 on select2 (ProLoser; 5m, 54s ago): Initially hidden inputs are having sizing issues
[17:07:15] <ProLoser|Work> anyone mind taking a look? i have a jsfiddle
[17:07:31] <shoky> looking
[17:08:14] <shoky> uhm you say:  Close the dropmenu
[17:08:17] <shoky> i see none
[17:08:31] <ProLoser|Work> right nvm
[17:08:34] <ProLoser|Work> just click anywhere
[17:08:56] <alanjhogan> Hey, the jQuery website has a banner for jQuery Conference 12. It looks great, but the apostrophe is backwards. http://static.jquery.com/promotion/banners/sf-2012.png
[17:08:58] <ProLoser|Work> updated the ticket
[17:09:07] <alanjhogan> anyone here responsible for the website / banner?
[17:09:17] <beancurd> heh.
[17:09:20] <ProLoser|Work> it's supposed to be like toys r us
[17:10:00] <xec> ProLoser|Work: you're passing a function to the data option?
[17:10:09] <shoky> ^
[17:10:19] <xec> is this some funky new thing or
[17:10:27] <ProLoser|Work> what do you mean?
[17:10:29] <ProLoser|Work> new vs what?
[17:10:51] <shoky> a string
[17:11:00] <shoky> or an array
[17:11:02] <xec> i thought you could only give it data to send, like a string or (json like) object literal
[17:11:06] <shoky> or object..
[17:11:43] <ProLoser|Work> it's select2, it's not $.ajax
[17:11:45] <shoky> xec that's right...
[17:11:55] <ProLoser|Work> the plugin does crap and then calls $.ajax
[17:12:00] <shoky> oh
[17:12:01] <ProLoser|Work> but regardless, the function is not the problem
[17:12:03] <shoky> wTf.
[17:12:11] <ProLoser|Work> ?
[17:12:12] <xec> ohh right
[17:12:17] <xec> what is select2
[17:12:18] <shoky> you didnt think to mention that
[17:12:26] <shoky> the most important thing probably
[17:12:28] <ProLoser|Work> look in resources
[17:12:30] <shoky> no shit
[17:12:58] <xec> yeah it's quite a few lines
[17:13:05] <ProLoser|Work> i figured putting the ticket on a project called 'select2' and saying i'm working on a plugin and the line of code with $('input').select2({ would give it away :/
[17:13:13] <xec> not like im gonna glance at it and understand whats going on :)
[17:13:51] <ProLoser|Work> it's not my plugin, i'm trying to dissect it
[17:14:14] <xec> ?glwtd
[17:14:14] <bot-t> http://goodluckwiththatdude.com/
[17:14:25] <shoky> haha
[17:14:55] <ProLoser|Work> so you've never had width calculation problems before?
[17:15:51] <shoky> uhh
[17:15:59] <shoky> <select>  dude...
[17:16:08] <ProLoser|Work> ?
[17:16:33] <xec> ProLoser|Work: is that what you're after? a placeholder for text input?
[17:16:43] <ProLoser|Work> what?
[17:16:44] <ProLoser|Work> no
[17:16:50] <ProLoser|Work> <input placeholder>
[17:16:51] <ProLoser|Work> that thing
[17:16:56] <ProLoser|Work> note how it looks cropped
[17:17:23] <cody--> https://gist.github.com/b387f42a50c0f796082f anyone have any input on why this dosnt work?
[17:17:27] <xec> yes, it's because the input is tiny, why is it tiny
[17:17:28] <xec> :D
[17:17:37] <ProLoser|Work> that's what i'm trying to figure out
[17:17:56] <xec> ProLoser|Work: my question was: what are you really after
[17:18:03] <ProLoser|Work> cody--: the callback takes a param
[17:18:08] <ProLoser|Work> or you're supposed to refer to this i think
[17:18:12] <xec> i mean, its super easy to make a bigger input
[17:18:13] <ProLoser|Work> iunno
[17:18:33] <cody--> that parts working this.name gives me the right value
[17:18:37] <alanjhogan> whom should I ping about that banner?
[17:18:42] <cody--> but its not actually setting the .text()
[17:18:59] <ProLoser|Work> you can set text?
[17:19:04] <ProLoser|Work> you sure it shouldn't be .html()
[17:19:22] <cody--> nvm
[17:19:27] <cody--> i needed to do: var option = $("<option>");
[17:19:32] <xec> alanjhogan: maybe try #jquery-dev
[17:19:36] <ProLoser|Work> touche
[17:20:08] <ProLoser|Work> cody--: you should cache the reference to the option and append it at the end
[17:20:59] <xec> ProLoser|Work: i made you a demo to demonstrate my point http://jsfiddle.net/q59t9/
[17:21:19] <ProLoser|Work> xec: what is your point?
[17:21:39] <xec> ProLoser|Work: that demo shows an input that works, i'm trying to figure out what it is you want
[17:22:09] <xec> what is this plugin doing
[17:22:10] <jyothi> http://pastebin.com/wzCiniE1
[17:22:24] <jyothi> can someone please take a look there? How would I go about submitting a file field with that jquery ajax post/
[17:22:45] <alanjhogan> thx
[17:22:47] <ProLoser|Work> xec: http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/
[17:23:12] <ProLoser|Work> jyothi: did you googl eit?

[17:30:04] <shoky> ajax doesn't work with a select? huh
[17:30:51] <xec> ProLoser|Work: it also works better if you hide it with javascript (plus you get graceful degradation) http://jsfiddle.net/gEnu4/4/
[17:31:37] <xec> of course, .parent().hide() isn't what i would use in production code, but you get the point
[17:34:40] <ProLoser|Work> xec the parent is hidden first before the child is binded to a plugin
[17:35:01] <ProLoser|Work> if you hide it first, THEN bind it will break
[17:35:29] <xec> ok, why don't you do it the other way around then
[17:35:38] <shoky> ?_?

[17:35:59] <xec> binded isn't a word btw, try "bound"
[17:37:05] <xec> ProLoser|Work: it appears the plugin measures the actual size of the select, and gets into trouble if it doesn't have a size
[17:37:22] <ProLoser|Work> i noticed, i've encountered this sort of behavior before elsewhere
[17:37:22] <xec> hidden visibility and hiding after the fact both seem to work

[18:10:50] <Bankzilla> permanently save?
[18:11:06] <coldhead> luks89: you can either store them as a cookie or send them to the server for storage
[18:12:14] <luks89> so there is not way to get the complete actual styleshheet with jquery?
[18:13:26] <Bankzilla> that would be server side
[18:13:44] <Bankzilla> jquery isn't allowed permissions for that as it's not secure
[18:27:44] <chovy> this doesn't work: $("input[name=foo[]]")
[18:28:38] <coldhead> chovy: you need to quote the "foo[]" part
[18:28:44] <coldhead> and probably escape the \

[18:29:42] <coldhead> $("input[name='foo\[\]']")

[19:05:20] <scvrory> i'm using jquery-sortable. is there a simple way to have normal clicks toggle selection (like what happens when you hold ctrl)
[19:06:03] <sente> i'm sure you could switch the events?
[19:06:08] <sente> well i'm not sure, but imagine
[19:08:04] <shoky> ?js console.log('bla')
[19:08:05] <bot-t> shoky: "bla"
[19:08:25] <shoky> ?js setTimeout(function() { console.log('bla') }, 100)
[19:08:26] <bot-t> shoky: ReferenceError: setTimeout is not defined
[19:09:23] <shoky> ?js (function() { $.getScript('http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.min.js', function() {  console.log($.fn.jquery) } ) })()
[19:09:24] <bot-t> shoky: ReferenceError: location is not defined

[20:54:36] <feathersanddown> from here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/   say that if "a malformed JSON string may result in an exception being thrown", but wich ?
[20:56:00] <shoky> feathersanddown: it's not an exception thrown by jQuery
[20:56:17] <feathersanddown> but wich one ?
[20:57:30] <shoky> SyntaxError probably
[20:58:19] <feathersanddown> thank you
[20:58:32] <shoky> but it depends
[20:58:42] <feathersanddown> ok no problem, it's ok for me
[20:58:53] <feathersanddown> JSON is only data?? it can't have functions ?
[20:59:01] <shoky> no functions
[20:59:37] <feathersanddown> ok thank you
[20:59:38] <feathersanddown> :)

[21:03:26] <hariom> Is it possible to return value from the success function of a async ajax call?
[21:04:28] <hariom> something like: var value = ajax(...);
[21:20:11] <adamSs> anyone know what the best way would be be retrieve the value of all checked boxes on a page?
[21:22:39] <jaypitidi> I'm using jquery ui to toggle the color of an h1 element. It works but the functionality I'm looking for isn't toggle but I want, on $(document).ready, for the color to automatically change to and from the colors I specify on a loop. How do I go about doing this?
[21:24:43] <beancurd> jaypitidi: $('h1.colorChange').css('color', loopColorVariable);
[21:24:46] <vpv4oo_> adamSs: <input type="checkbox" name="checked[]"> foreach($POST['checked'] as $k => $v) { ... }
[21:25:12] <jaypitidi> but wouldn't that make it blink rather than animate?
[21:25:37] <beancurd> oh wait. you want it to pulse between multiple colors indefinitely?
[21:25:41] <jaypitidi> Yes
[21:25:46] <jaypitidi> or at least until clicked
[21:25:52] <beancurd> i thought you meant you wanted it to cycle through colors everytime a person refreshes.
[21:26:29] <jaypitidi> Is it possible to pulse between multiple colors like that?
[21:27:01] <beancurd> are the colors predefined?
[21:27:50] <lazzyhippo> Hi, I'm looking for a way to align the input placeholder to right
[21:28:05] <lazzyhippo> many sites have suggested css styling with this selector --> ::-webkit-input-placeholder
[21:28:11] <Gates> hi
[21:28:13] <lazzyhippo> but apparently text-align is not supported on Safari
[21:28:23] <lazzyhippo> any jQuery solution for that?
[21:28:48] <Gates> Is there a way to do like a page flip
[21:28:52] <beancurd> jaypitidi: might be easier to just hardcode the fadein/fadeout .css in your loop?
[21:28:54] <Gates> but without the effeects
[21:29:03] <Gates> just like a NEXT and just two pages next to each other
[21:29:08] <Gates> and they just load the content
[21:29:14] <Gates> it has to load 88 pages though :|
[21:29:37] <beancurd> gates, 88 pages of text? or images.
[21:30:20] <Gates> its for a magazine
[21:30:26] <Gates> so it will be images
[21:30:29] <jaypitidi> beancured:yes
[21:30:37] <Gates> and then u select the image and it will open up to a litebox with text
[21:30:39] <Gates> beancurd: ^
[21:31:32] <Gates> beancurd: it might have to like preload the image or something?
[21:31:37] <Gates> without loading them all
[21:31:59] <picori> How can I change an element's name? <a> to a <span> for example?
[21:32:51] <lazzyhippo> anyone knows how to align the HTML5 placeholder to right using jQuery?
[21:33:11] <coldhead> you can't, picori
[21:33:22] <coldhead> that's like saying how do i make my wife mary into jeanine
[21:33:23] <jaypitidi> http://jsfiddle.net/Mp3NQ/ this is what I have which changes the color onload how can I get it to loop back?
[21:34:14] <picori> oh..
[21:34:28] <beancurd> Gates: there're quite a few flipbook jquery plugins wich will do what you describe
[21:34:42] <Gates> beancurd: i must be looking up something wrong
[21:34:55] <Gates> they all have these stupid cheese effects
[21:35:43] <beancurd> http://builtbywill.com/code/booklet/examples/hash#/
[21:36:19] <Gates> yea see the stupid flip effect
[21:36:44] <adamSs> anyone know what the best way would be be retrieve a list of all checked checkboxes?
[21:36:44] <beancurd> you want fade?
[21:37:19] <Gates> i dont need anything
[21:37:22] <Gates> just pop!
[21:37:27] <beancurd> why not just something like this then. turn off the fade.
[21:37:29] <beancurd> http://www.twospy.com/galleriffic/example-1.html
[21:38:07] <Gates> i guess that works
[21:38:12] <Gates> and just put two next to eachother?
[21:38:31] <Gates> thinking something like this function
[21:38:32] <Gates> http://purple.fr/magazine/s-s-2012-issue-17/210
[21:38:32] <beancurd> just 2up pages so they're a magazine spread.
[21:38:42] <beancurd> then show them one by one.
[21:39:26] <Gates> hmm
[21:39:31] <Gates> beancurd: can that be responsive?
[21:40:25] <beancurd> what do you mean by responsive.
[21:40:44] <beancurd> respond to resolution change?
[21:40:50] <Gates> yes
[21:41:19] <beancurd> you'd have to code that in if you wanted it, and decide how you want the layout to change.
[21:41:41] <Gates> hmm
[21:42:00] <Gates> http://www.varmag.com/turnjs/home.html
[21:42:07] <Gates> this seems nice but it has too much it feels
[21:42:34] <Gates> not sure how im ganna do 88 pages with this too :|
[21:46:52] <Gates> beancurd: can u help me make the images dynamic?
[21:49:23] <beancurd> with what plugin?
[21:51:29] <Gates> turn.js
[21:51:36] <Gates> the last link
[21:51:55] <Gates> i guess i can just express it with each page's content
[22:00:31] <notwen> I have a $('a').click that is being used to change the content of a div with .html, but I need the a.click to also take effect within the div (even after .html call), what's the best way to go about this?
[22:01:52] <beancurd> put all the things you want the click to do in a function, then trigger the function with the click.
[22:08:00] <notwen> beancurd, http://derp.us/er/ - this is what I have, but the links loaded in the .html on line 25 stop reacting after the second click
[22:08:36] <adamSs> $("#testdiv", parent.document).class() - isnt working anyone know how i would get the class attribute from that?
[22:14:39] <Gates> any way to make this (flip.js) render each image nicer? http://www.varmag.com/turnjs/home.html
[22:14:43] <Gates> esp at a higher resolution?
[22:14:53] <Gates> like with a load wheel
[22:15:58] <Gates> err turnjs**
[22:15:59] <Gates> not flip
