[00:01:39] <Vivekananda> jphase: well so in the www.safeview.com  scroll down and enter 'app' in the search and choose a product. Then you see that each level ( ie  a/h/o) has two sublevels. I am trying to make   the uppermost level and second level ( ie sublevel 1)  visible but the third level (sublevel 2)  hidden with toggle
[00:01:43] <Vivekananda> makes sense ?
[00:02:19] <_|Nix|_> abishek: Do you know the range ahead of time?
[00:03:02] <abishek> yes
[00:03:38] <abishek> _|Nix|_, range meaning the start and end right?
[00:04:12] <_|Nix|_> abishek: Yeah, the range of values.
[00:05:16] <abishek> Yes, i know them
[00:05:58] <jphase> Vivekananda: sorta, just stick a toggle button inside level 1 and when you click that button do $(this).siblings('ul').slideToggle();
[00:06:14] <abishek> _|Nix|_, what I am having difficulty is to set the intervals correctly. I don't need intervals for every step but a configurable set of labels
[00:06:42] <Vivekananda> jphase: so slideToggle() is standard ?
[00:07:05] <jphase> if by standard you mean native to jQuery, then yes
[00:08:52] <_|Nix|_> abishek: How do you mean "configurable"?
[00:09:08] <_|Nix|_> abishek: What exactly should it be possible to configure about the labels?
[00:10:40] <abishek> _|Nix|_, configurable in the meaning, if I mention the intervals as [10,20,50,100,200,300,500,600,700,800,1000], the labels need to align correctly on the slider
[00:11:41] <_|Nix|_> abishek: OK, so you provide a list of numbers within the range, and you need to generate labels that are placed correctly. Right?
[00:11:49] <abishek> yes
[00:14:42] <_|Nix|_> abishek: Workin' on it ...
[00:16:09] <abishek> _|Nix|_, thnx appreciate it. one quick question though. The step needs to be only 10 and the one should be able to select the step between the intervals. Will that be the case?
[00:30:12] <FilipNortic> is .load() always async or does it depend?
[00:32:06] <_|Nix|_> abishek: http://jsbin.com/dapabegu/4/edit go from there
[00:32:48] <Cork> FilipNortic: always
[00:32:52] <abishek> _|Nix|_, looking at it, give me a min
[00:33:10] <Cork> FilipNortic: also you should never use sync ajax calls
[00:35:59] <FilipNortic> Cork: Ok, is i think i've done so a few times are there any serious gotchas or just a readability issue?
[00:36:41] <Cork> FilipNortic: it is a long list of gotchas
[00:36:45] <Cork> readability isn't the problem at all
[00:37:00] <Cork> FilipNortic: the entire page freezes if you do sync ajax calls
[00:37:04] <abishek> _|Nix|_, looks good. I can proceed from here. appreciate your help
[00:37:26] <Cork> FilipNortic: and ti will freeze until the response comes back from the server; or the connection times out if the server can't be reached
[00:37:58] <Cork> FilipNortic: this will include everything in the page includeing redraws by the browser
[00:38:28] <Cork> FilipNortic: and in browsers where the pace isn't in a separate process, you will freeze the entire browser
[00:38:36] <Cork> pace==page
[00:39:01] <_|Nix|_> abishek: Here's a cleaned-up version: http://jsbin.com/dapabegu/5/
[00:39:38] <_|Nix|_> abishek: Have fun!
[00:39:46] <abishek> Thank you very much
[00:42:15] <GoSox> So i'm playing around with this <iframe> on my page. I have a url loaded into the frame. I want to clear that content out, but using .removeAttr("src"); doesn't delete the actual content, even though setting that 'src' attribute to a new url DOES cause that new url to get loaded in
[00:42:18] <GoSox> any ideas?
[00:42:55] <Cork> GoSox: prop('src', 'about:blank')
[00:45:17] <heythere> morning guys. i got something like this http://jsfiddle.net/tN8Rx/1/ .... and want to make it work like pulling json putting it in a variable and download it in a csv on click
[00:45:23] <heythere> any ideas ?
[00:46:30] <GoSox> Cork: that doesn't do it either
[00:47:02] <GoSox> oh wait i might have made a mistake
[00:47:36] <n3ssi3> Hi there :) I'm looking for a solution to drag an element within a viewport, while the viewport is smaller then the dragging object. Here my example: http://jsfiddle.net/6y2p5/ The goal is to be able to drag the blue box around without ever seeing the red background. Does jQuery provide a plugin for this? As far as I can see UI Draggable does not support
[00:47:36] <n3ssi3> that
[00:48:06] <GoSox> Cork: my code was working after all, i just had the wrong selector because i need sleep, and food :)
[00:48:53] <dwarder> i have this kind of markup  <span class='checked'><input data-myvalue='42'></span , how do i get _all_ myvalue's which has parent checked span tag ?
[00:49:51] <Cork> dwarder: var values = $.map($('.checked input'), function(elm) { return $(this).val(); });
[00:49:59] <Cork> dwarder: or just serializeArray() the form
[00:50:48] <dwarder> Cork: thanks, i'll use the map
[00:55:57] <heythere> hmm noone to help around in here ...
[00:59:33] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone tell me what to do with this data: http://pastie.org/9198280 to make it work with typeahead. I think I need to filter it but not sure into what format. It‚Äôs well formed JSON atm
[01:00:14] <fRAiLtY-> I have this typeahead: http://pastie.org/9198285 so far but it errors, and I‚Äôm pretty sure my data isn‚Äôt in the correct format :x
[01:14:08] <abishek> assuming I have an array like http://jsbin.com/pusit/2/edit , what would be an ideal way to find the pricing if the a user wants to by 56 items

[01:18:41] <ramkamx> (and it's not my startup, i'm helping a friend)
[01:19:18] <heythere> i hope they fail ramkamx too many start ups ...
[01:19:27] <ramkamx> he
[01:19:38] <ramkamx> why do you want them to fail -)
[01:20:01] <ramkamx> i want them to be happy :-)
[01:20:29] <heythere> why not? lol i don't rly want to help them, i don't want people to be happy! technically you can only be happy for about 2 minutes a day
[01:22:45] <Simon__> hello one short newbie question, is it posiible to start with those portlets in closed state? http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#portlets
[01:23:00] <ramkamx> heythere: damn, i made you happy, you wrote lol :D
[01:23:32] <heythere> :)
[01:23:37] <ramkamx> :)
[01:23:46] <Simon__> but load it open and close it immidatly with jquery to avoid missing information to those with deactivate js?
[01:24:29] <xec> Simon__: sure. you could just add .click() at line 62 in that demo to simulate a click on the toggle
[01:25:11] <fRAiLtY-> Any idea what ‚Äúelems is not defined‚Äù points to as a problem?
[01:25:55] <xec> fRAiLtY-: maybe you need to define elems :P
[01:26:01] <xec> fRAiLtY-: what is the context
[01:26:15] <Simon__> $( ".portlet-toggle" ).add.click() --??
[01:26:28] <Simon__> that is all for all the portlets?
[01:26:32] <xec> Simon__: uh what
[01:26:40] <xec> no
[01:27:19] <fRAiLtY-> xec: Using typeahead with jquery 1.9.1, implementation copied direct from examples on site, when prefetch happens I get that error in jquery file, line 747
[01:27:24] <xec> Simon__: .click(function(){...}) adds a click handler. which is done at line 58
[01:27:45] <xec> Simon__: if you do just .click() it will trigger a click event
[01:28:08] <xec> Simon__: so if you do .click(function(){...}).click() you will attach a handler and trigger it once on load
[01:29:05] <xec> fRAiLtY-: what is typeahead?
[01:29:14] <fRAiLtY-> bootstrap auto completer
[01:29:31] <xec> can you make a demo?
[01:29:56] <Simon__> ah ok and in my example all "divs" with class .portlet-toggle get there a click handler and with click() i toggle all once?
[01:30:10] <xec> right
[01:30:23] <Simon__> ah ok thx i will try this ;-)
[01:30:30] <fRAiLtY-> xec, will try

[02:49:41] <cpex> ok thanks Cork
[02:55:13] <Jisan> i need help with jquery, is anybody here?
[02:57:06] <Woet> please don't ask to ask.

[03:02:20] <cem___> hi how to change content style property using jquery ?
[03:02:33] <Jisan> Woet can you please see why is not the drop down of country list working in this url http://lovelygreens-shop.com/checkout/   i'm assuming it's a jQuery issue
[03:03:34] <Cork> cem___: .css
[03:03:37] <Cork> ?css
[03:03:37] <b-ot> Cork: http://i.imgur.com/Q3cUg29.gif
[03:03:43] <Cork> O_o
[03:03:54] <Cork> sigh...
[03:04:03] <cem___> Cork: bro i tried but its not changing
[03:04:04] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/css/
[03:04:25] <Cork> cem___: have you verified that the selector matches the element your trying to change?
[03:08:15] <Woet> Jisan: try passing width to the chosen element
[03:08:32] <Woet> Jisan:  $(".chosen").chosen({width: "300px"});
[03:09:00] <Jisan> Thankd Woet i just have figured it out
[03:09:09] <dwarder> delete object.part set it to undefined, but how can i remove this part?
[03:09:15] <Jisan> .chzn-drop class should have a width value
[03:18:02] <cem___> Cork: i want to change a pseudo css selector
[03:18:27] <Cork> cem___: you can't set that on an element
[03:18:33] <Cork> you need selectors to do that :)
[03:18:39] <Cork> not style rules
[03:23:05] <dwarder> what does 'undefined ◊ 2' means?
[03:24:26] <Lebbe> dwarder: that you have an array consisting of two slots both with the value undefined
[03:25:08] <Lebbe> at least '[undefined √ó 2]' means this
[03:32:12] <dwarder> Lebbe: aha got it
[03:32:27] <dwarder> Lebbe: how do i delete an element from an erray?
[03:33:14] <dwarder> Lebbe: splice
[03:35:45] <MantasK> hi
[03:45:17] <brunoais> MantasK, yo
[03:45:48] <Lebbe> dwarder: if you want to delete the last element in an array just use .pop()
[03:45:54] <Lebbe> it also returns the element
[03:47:18] <Lebbe> if you want to delete element x in the array you use splice
[03:47:36] <Lebbe> array.splice(x,1)
[03:48:13] <Lebbe> both pop and splice returns the removed element, but splice returns the element inside an array
[03:49:22] <brunoais> Lebbe, to be more precise, splice returns an array of the elements that were removed :)
[03:49:44] <MantasK> gosh i didnt think someone is still using irc o.O
[03:49:55] <brunoais> what do you mean?
[03:50:20] <brunoais> I believe 791 people are not with ya :D
[03:50:48] <MantasK> i guess
[03:50:51] <Lebbe> brunoais: yap :)
[03:51:12] <Lebbe> and the second argument in array.splice(x,1) says you want to remove 1 element
[03:51:26] <brunoais> hum hum :)
[03:52:13] <TuomasL> Never nice to barge in and immediately ask a question. But does anyone know how I can "restart" this plugin on e.g. a callback? http://www.mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/
[03:53:03] <TuomasL> What I am doing is, I have a data-text on each slider of flexslider, and I just want to feed typed.js that on each after callback of flexslider.
[03:53:12] <TuomasL> *each slide that is
[03:54:57] <MantasK> a question for zurb foundation lovers - is there a way to make zurb foundations orbit slider slide/move vertically?
[03:56:27] <TuomasL> MantasK, what about what is says here under advanced options? animation: 'fade',                  // fade, horizontal-slide, vertical-slide, horizontal-push
[03:56:33] <TuomasL> http://zurb.com/playground/orbit-jquery-image-slider
[03:58:01] <TuomasL> Although, it seems different there. Thought it would have retained the same options under foundation.
[03:58:30] <MantasK> TuomasL, well the foundation 5 removed this option
[03:58:45] <TuomasL> Yes, which I realized moments thereafter.
[03:58:46] <TuomasL> :>
[04:01:05] <MantasK> could you recomend any other lightweight jquery slider?
[04:01:57] <TuomasL> I've used Flexslider a lot lately. Has vertical slide out of the box.
[04:02:03] <TuomasL> http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/
[04:02:48] <TuomasL> use options:
[04:02:50] <TuomasL> animation: "slide",
[04:02:51] <TuomasL> direction: "vertical"
[04:03:27] <MantasK> ill try it, thanks
[04:06:19] <nerium> I'm using JQM 1.4
[04:06:20] <nerium> Why does the menys overlap?
[04:06:21] <nerium> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Ckocd
[04:06:39] <TuomasL> MantasK, example: http://jsfiddle.net/D3d4J/1/
[04:08:12] <TuomasL> nerium: why does the button have margin -1em
[04:08:35] <TuomasL> only overlap I saw
[04:08:57] <nerium> TuomasL: I dont know. Im just using JQM
[04:09:45] <nerium> TuomasL: It looks like this to me: http://i.imgur.com/nUOtajR.png
[04:11:10] <TuomasL> yes exactly, same here
[04:11:18] <TuomasL> just seems odd as default behaviour
[04:12:47] <TuomasL> or is it just about using the framework a bit wrong maybe? probably has some point, but that's the reason, the listview has negative margin
[04:13:07] <nerium> Yeah, that must be it
[04:13:23] <TuomasL> it is, inspector says so :)
[04:13:32] <TuomasL> and editing the top margin fixes it
[04:19:43] <nerium> TuomasL: Placing the navbar inside a listview worked
[04:19:50] <nerium> But I'm not sure that's the way to go
[04:20:18] <TuomasL> indeed
[04:55:54] <carpii> im migrating a site from jquery 1.4.4 to latest, and in many cases this involves changing .attr() to .prop().  Im having a problem where .prop(‚Äúrel‚Äù) returns undefined sometimes, even though its set and .attr(‚Äúrel‚Äù) returns a valid value. Any ideas?
[04:56:38] <carpii> ciscor, why are you sending me webcam links?
[04:56:48] <Cork> carpii: might be that your setting invalid values?
[04:57:13] <Cork> your not showing what element your having the problem on, so it is hard to tell
[04:57:36] <carpii> Cork, they are set in the html rather than dynamically. But I hadnt thought of that, I‚Äôll check
[04:57:57] <Cork> carpii: .attr will read the string that came from the html
[04:58:08] <Cork> so it might actually be what you want in some cases
[04:59:12] <carpii> yeah, i understand. its one of my least favorite changes in jquery :(
[04:59:55] <Cork> carpii: why?
[05:00:04] <Cork> it was fixing an implementation bug
[05:00:15] <carpii> yeah i know why they did it, just it doesnt seem that well documented
[05:00:24] <carpii> theres a bunch of places where you *have* to use .prop
[05:00:33] <carpii> but none of these lists seem complete
[05:00:43] <Cork> carpii: it is quite easy
[05:00:50] <Cork> you should use prop instead of attr
[05:01:04] <Cork> and for the few situations where you don't want the browser corrected values
[05:01:05] <Cork> use attr
[05:01:19] <Cork> the need for attr is a better description then the need for prop
[05:01:28] <Cork> cause it is quite short
[05:01:43] <carpii> browser corrected means its coming from the DOM rather than just reading html source right?
[05:01:56] <Cork> carpii: none of them comes from reading the html
[05:02:08] <Cork> but a simple example is hrefs
[05:02:12] <carpii> but attr never came form the DOM i think?
[05:02:26] <Cork> property for href is the full url with protocol and everything
[05:02:31] <Cork> carpii: it did
[05:02:36] <carpii> hm ok
[05:02:41] <Cork> carpii: the old attr used the property of the dom element
[05:02:55] <Cork> and in a few hardcoded exceptions it used getAttribute
[05:03:12] <Cork> making things quite confusing an annoying to use
[05:03:24] <carpii> so how does .prop differ, if thats reading the dom property too?
[05:03:43] <Cork> prop(name) is basically doing elm[name]
[05:03:59] <Cork> and attr(name) does getAttribute(name)
[05:04:16] <Cork> the old attr did a mix
[05:07:24] <carpii> ok thanks, i guess i need to write some test cases and better understad it
[05:12:33] <carpii> do you know what the situation is with setting .attr(‚Äúdata-mydata‚Äù), theres always been a bit of a strange relationship between data- attributes and jQuery .data() ?
[05:12:51] <Cork> carpii: .data() is cached
[05:13:05] <Cork> it only reads the attribute if there isn't an entry in the cache
[05:13:22] <Cork> you can remove the entry with removeData('mydata') though
[05:13:24] <carpii> if i have css which relies on data- attributes, should I still be using attr?
[05:13:28] <Cork> and then .data() will read the attribute
[05:13:33] <carpii> or can i just use .data()
[05:13:35] <Cork> carpii: yes
[05:13:42] <carpii> yes to attr?
[05:13:44] <Cork> cause .data won't update the attribute
[05:13:48] <carpii> ok got it, thanks
[05:14:08] <carpii> and theres never a case when id want to .prop(‚Äòdata-etc‚Äô, 3) right?
[05:14:49] <Cork> carpii: sure there is
[05:14:53] <carpii> oh
[05:14:56] <Cork> but not if you want the attribute updated
[05:15:07] <carpii> but why wouldnt i just use .data(‚Äòetc‚Äô, 3) ?
[05:15:14] <Cork> carpii: the cache exist cause it lets .data store things attr can't
[05:15:29] <Cork> ah, sorry read wrong
[05:15:52] <Cork> ya, prop doens't work with the data- prefix
[05:15:57] <carpii> ok cool
[05:16:06] <carpii> its coming together now i think, thanks for your help :)

[06:18:03] <dwarder> BillCriswell: please help
[06:18:15] <BillCriswell> Are you in an interview or something?
[06:18:38] <BillCriswell> dwarder: http://handlebarsjs.com/expressions.html#helpers
[06:21:31] <dwarder> BillCriswell: no
[06:21:44] <dwarder> BillCriswell: i'm on deadline
[06:22:08] <BillCriswell> Did that link help?
[06:22:37] <dwarder> BillCriswell: sort of, i can't console.log anything that is inside helper to debug this thing
[06:23:14] <MikeD_> "on deadline" usually is screaming "poor planning/management"  (i know that's not helpful, just making an observation)
[06:23:36] <dwarder> MikeD_: not helping at all :p
[06:24:21] <MikeD_> well, i don't know handlebars... so it's the best i can do at the moment.
[06:25:53] <dwarder> MikeD_: thanks
[06:26:44] <bberry> man
[06:27:00] <bberry> there sure is a lot of library layering
[06:27:03] <bberry> in js
[06:27:23] <BillCriswell> bberry: Indeed.
[06:27:24] <MikeD_> where isn't there a lot of library layering?
[06:27:55] <bberry> haha, probably a good point. all my c/c++ projects i just write everything
[06:28:10] <bberry> but that is for controller/project specific stuff, so i kind of have to
[06:30:27] <BillCriswell> dwarder: http://jsbin.com/nojahiqo/1/edit?js,output here's a basic one I wrote up real quick with some examples from the site.
[06:30:42] <BillCriswell> Never really messed with handlebars though so it might not be the best way, but it should hopefully give an idea.
[06:32:19] <dwarder> BillCriswell: thanks a lot
[06:32:25] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[06:50:53] <JovanJ> Hello, does anyone knows how i can make image to rotates all the time?
[06:57:11] <BillCriswell> JovanJ: CSS animations.
[06:58:07] <JovanJ> Is it possible to make it so it rotates all the time?
[06:58:14] <JovanJ> like in cricle
[06:58:52] <JovanJ> BillCriswell ^
[06:58:59] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[06:59:11] <JovanJ> Do you know how? Any reference?
[06:59:52] <JovanJ> BillCriswell ^
[07:02:52] <BillCriswell> JovanJ: http://jsbin.com/nowozijo/2/edit?css,output
[07:05:33] <JovanJ> BillCriswell  for some reason it doesn't rotates :/
[07:05:56] <BillCriswell> You would need to add the right prefixes for certain browsers. That would only work in Chrome / Safari.
[07:06:46] <decx> how is transform still prefixed anyway
[07:06:55] <decx> there's no difference in the markup like gradient
[07:07:07] <decx> syntax even
[07:07:49] <BillCriswell> decx: I blame Obama.
[07:08:16] <JovanJ> Thank you! :)
[07:08:25] <decx> it's all the same matrix3d(1, 2, 0, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 6, 0, 1)
[07:09:04] <BillCriswell> decx: I don't understand any of those numbers, even individually.
[07:09:11] <BillCriswell> JovanJ: No problem.
[07:09:17] <BillCriswell> decx: PS: Season 5 of Curb.
[07:09:21] <BillCriswell> Almost at 6.
[07:09:29] <decx> well transform has translate, rotate, scale, scew
[07:09:35] <decx> matrix3d is that in one
[07:10:17] <BillCriswell> decx: Sounds awesome but it would probably take a while to understand.
[07:10:36] <decx> moreso if you can't math like myself
[07:10:58] <decx> just fill in numbers and refresh
[07:11:40] <decx> it's like a puzzle
[07:13:16] <BillCriswell> decx: I am a pretty good guesser.
[07:14:47] <BillCriswell> Go ahead, have me guess anything.
[07:15:18] <slax0r> guess my shoe size
[07:15:23] <BillCriswell> 10
[07:16:53] <BillCriswell> Do I win?
[07:18:53] <decx> it's even more confusing than i thought
[07:19:09] <decx> all that cos and sin for degrees
[07:19:11] <decx> yuk
[07:19:16] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/f63FM/ no prefixes
[07:20:52] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know why my checkbox toggle isn't working. Tried a few things, this is the simplist way I'm trying to go about it - http://jsfiddle.net/4NEyN/ - I want the input[type="checkbox"] to toggle between checked and unchecked.
[07:21:05] <DeltaHeavy> Additional critisism is welcome.
[07:21:16] <decx> no need for js
[07:21:20] <decx> your label is already doing it
[07:23:22] <sadtaco> How do I select elements that are NOT children of elements with a certain class?
[07:23:55] <slax0r> sadtaco: :not selector?
[07:24:44] <BillCriswell> sadtaco: $('.foo').children().not('.bar') ?
[07:24:59] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: http://jsfiddle.net/4NEyN/1/ ?
[07:25:54] <BillCriswell> sadtaco: .foo > *:not(.bar) could also work... ideally you wouldn't use * but you know your markup better than me.
[07:26:32] <BillCriswell> Actually, the * probably isn't needed at all.
[07:26:41] <BillCriswell> .foo > :not(.bar)
[07:27:06] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: I want it so if I click on the <p> or <div>, it'll toggle the 'checked' state of the checkbox. I'm not quite sure what this is doing, or how it's managing to toggle between true and false when nothing seems to be changing.
[07:27:41] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: The hidden checkbox's check state is changing since you're clicking its label.
[07:28:15] <DeltaHeavy> OH SNAP
[07:28:20] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: Thanks
[07:28:25] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: No problem!
[07:28:30] <DeltaHeavy> I learnded something new today
[07:28:33] <BillCriswell> Did you say that like Detek?
[07:28:36] <BillCriswell> Derek*
[07:28:37] <decx> unless you're targeting ie7 that's just css input:checked ~ div { background-color: green }
[07:29:16] <BillCriswell> Labels really come in handy.
[07:29:43] <BillCriswell> Especially when you can style one relative to its input.
[07:29:57] <decx> fyi you don'T want to display: none the form element
[07:30:08] <BillCriswell> Truff.
[07:30:18] <decx> visibility: hidden or opacity:0; position: absoute;
[07:30:19] <decx> lute
[07:30:33] <sadtaco> Those look like the opposite of what I need
[07:30:34] <sadtaco> No?
[07:31:07] <sadtaco> I need elements where .closets('.class') would return nothing
[07:31:11] <sadtaco> closest*
[07:31:32] <decx> :not
[07:31:34] <BillCriswell> sadtaco: got it.
[07:32:02] <BillCriswell> sadtaco: I guess I just misread. It was worded kind of funny.
[07:32:03] <sadtaco> <div class="foo"><p /></div><p />.  I need the last p, not the one inside foo
[07:32:22] <sadtaco> I guess div:not('foo') p would do it
[07:32:27] <BillCriswell> sadtaco: That isn't what I thought you asked for even the second time I read.
[07:32:31] <sadtaco> as long as <p> is inside another element
[07:32:37] <sadtaco> another div i mean
[07:32:56] <BillCriswell> $('p').filter(function(){ return $(this).prev().is('.foo'); }) is what i think you'd want there.
[07:32:57] <decx> sadtaco http://jsfiddle.net/decx/gm7f4/
[07:32:59] <sadtaco> <div><div class="foo"><p /></div><p /></div>  "div:not(.foo) p" should get it right?
[07:33:38] <sadtaco> what does that comma in the selector do?
[07:33:50] <decx> $(selector, context)
[07:34:12] <decx> akin to $(context).find(selector)
[07:34:12] <sadtaco> ah
[07:34:29] <BillCriswell> I am so lost.
[07:35:51] <sadtaco> It's k I got it
[07:41:21] <axscode> clear

[07:50:58] <Jisan_> Hello
[07:51:09] <Jisan_> i have a jquery related question
[07:51:50] <Jisan_> how can i stop a slider on a page? like disable the jquery actions
[07:52:03] <Jisan_> want to investigate into some elements on the slider
[08:03:48] <BillCriswell> Jisan_: There's a disable method.
[08:04:04] <BillCriswell> Not exactly sure what that does but sounds relevant haha.
[08:04:22] <BillCriswell> Today is going to be a day of HTML emails and print stylesheets. The worst of all days.
[08:07:57] <pnj> hi
[08:08:01] <pnj> http://jsfiddle.net/pnj4130/M69AM/4/
[08:08:35] <pnj> I'm trying to get the div to change the css based on the interval
[08:08:54] <pnj> eventually, I want it to go left/right and fade in and out with opacity
[08:09:08] <pnj> can someone tell me what is up w/ my if() statment?
[08:09:59] <BillCriswell> pnj: >= instead of =>
[08:10:37] <pnj> BillCriswell: WHAAAAAAA... :) dang. that was easy. thanks
[08:10:39] <BillCriswell> ` at the start of the script too. http://jsfiddle.net/M69AM/5/ is working... I think.
[08:11:01] <BillCriswell> pnj: Not sure if it's what you're going for but it's at least showing alittle life.
[08:11:16] <pnj> just making the change you suggested made it work. weird that the jsHint thing didnt point that out
[08:11:59] <pnj> that works perfectly BillCriswell . thanks again
[08:12:07] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:12:57] <pnj> BillCriswell: is there a simpler way to do this type of thing w/ Jquery?
[08:14:02] <BillCriswell> pnj: Is this doing exactly what you wanted?
[08:14:52] <pnj> well, I need to add the Else bit that will send it back to Left:250px; but yea, pretty close
[08:15:06] <pnj> basicly, an animated gif, in Jquery :)
[08:15:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> hellome, can one refresh an image without using the src attribute?
[08:15:56] <BillCriswell> So you want it to go back and forth?
[08:16:20] <pnj> yes. and fade in and out with opacity. which, I should be able to do.
[08:16:31] <pnj> just curious if there is a simpler method (less code)
[08:17:22] <BillCriswell> pnj: What browser support is needed?
[08:17:42] <pnj> none, it's just a test for my own learning
[08:18:17] <pnj> I'm just trying to learn some stuff and maybe get a job and then... take over the world. )
[08:18:54] <decx> no js needed
[08:19:03] <BillCriswell> pnj: I would use CSS animations for this in particular.  If you wanted to learn a jQuery way you could use animates callback.
[08:19:24] <Crucials> guys, im trying to edit wrap a span around letters in a website. It works on divs and stuff, but breaks the markup
[08:19:25] <BillCriswell> If you're using jQuery UI the .toggleClass() method can make it a lot easier.
[08:19:27] <pnj> CSS3 animations?
[08:19:33] <BillCriswell> pnj: Yes.
[08:19:46] <Crucials> how do I not break the site's markup and still wrap a <span> for example around words?
[08:19:50] <pnj> cool. I'll look into that. thanks
[08:24:09] <BillCriswell> pnj: CSS animations would be first though, so many advantages, browser support could use a little work as always with everything awesome.
[08:24:38] <BillCriswell> Crucials: What do you mean breaks the markup?
[08:25:00] <Crucials> like I mean it replaces letters it finds in javascript and markup on the page it seems
[08:25:36] <MikeD_> how do I use this code?  https://gist.github.com/eikes/9484101
[08:26:24] <marc_v92> MikeD_: Make sure you have jQuery referenced at the top of the page, then put that code either in a JS file or in some <script> tags
[08:26:35] <marc_v92> It should do the rest automagically.
[08:26:56] <jphase> well actually you still need to call the method
[08:27:08] <MikeD_> right, that's the part i'm not clear on how to call it
[08:27:12] <jphase> $('whateverradios').uncheckableRadio();
[08:27:16] <MikeD_> ok, thanks
[08:27:33] <BillCriswell> uncheckable radio... what?
[08:27:36] <jphase> although I find the entire thing funny since radios are already uncheckable? didn't read the code
[08:27:36] <jphase> lol
[08:27:52] <jphase> that's normally called a "checkbox"
[08:28:00] <marc_v92> kphase: Radio != Checkbox. :)
[08:28:15] <jphase> marc_v92: an "uncheckable radio" = "a checkbox"
[08:28:20] <jphase> but thanks for the lesson :P
[08:28:22] <decx> what's wrong with the disabled attribute?
[08:28:37] <marc_v92> jphase: Except checkboxes allow you to select multiple options. Radio buttons do not.
[08:28:49] <MikeD_> yeah, that's an unfortunate name
[08:29:02] <BillCriswell> decx: ++
[08:29:05] <jphase> that's true, but easier to use checks that uncheck their siblings :\
[08:29:15] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: http://jsbin.com/zewafuwo/1/edit
[08:29:31] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/zewafuwo/2/edit?html,output ***
[08:29:53] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Then you can just do $('.some-radio').prop('disabled', true);
[08:30:08] <MikeD_> it's not a disabling... it's a deselecting
[08:30:16] <MikeD_> you know, using it wrong
[08:30:30] <MikeD_> like grabbing a pipe wrench to drive a nail.
[08:30:42] <MikeD_> it can work, but it's still not right.
[08:31:17] <BillCriswell> Just selecting another value would deselect it.
[08:32:14] <MikeD_> right, it's a matter of changing your mind about choosing a required 1 of N control - you are absolutely preaching to the choir that it's wrong to add code to make this functionality, i get it.
[08:32:58] <decx> oh deselecting a radio button
[08:33:21] <decx> normally that's done by adding a "none of the above" radiobutton that's checked by default
[08:33:46] <hk3380> i have a theme where when i hover over an item in the navbar, an animation effects starts off where the color of the item fades into another. how do i find the code that does this?
[08:34:13] <decx> in the css :p
[08:34:14] <jphase> hk3380: search your stylesheet for :hover if it's done correctly
[08:34:15] <jphase> hehe
[08:35:04] <hk3380> can you do that with css?
[08:35:06] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: http://jsbin.com/zewafuwo/3/edit?js,output so nothing here helps?
[08:35:14] <hk3380> or can you load a js script from css on hover?
[08:35:22] <pnj> BillCriswell: are you a web dev?
[08:35:53] <BillCriswell> pnj: Sounds about right haha.
[08:36:54] <decx> how have i never used animation-play-state
[08:36:55] <pnj> how long have you been doing this stuff?
[08:37:21] <hk3380> jphase: i found the css line that does it, but it just sets the color
[08:37:25] <BillCriswell> pnj: About... 12 years at this point?
[08:37:25] <hk3380> it doesn't set the fade effect
[08:37:45] <jphase> hk3380: the fade effect isn't in the hover, look for "animation"
[08:37:51] <jphase> or transition
[08:38:03] <hk3380> jphase: where
[08:38:03] <jphase> my bad :x
[08:38:03] <MikeD_> BillCriswell: the existing 'feature' i'm trying to mimic is clicking an already checked radio will deselect it  ... maybe I should be looking for a checkbox hack
[08:38:10] <BillCriswell> Started right before like 10th / 11th grade.
[08:38:26] <jphase> hk3380: in your stylehseet, search for "transition"
[08:39:23] <sadtaco> Hm. I have a list that's sortable. I need to also be able to put lists inside that list, where those inner lists are also sortable and can sort back into the parent. I don't see how to do that.  The inner lists are added dynamically, too.
[08:40:37] <pnj> wow. this CSS3 stuff is wicked cool
[08:40:51] <pnj> too bad it only works in the latest browsers
[08:40:51] <brunoais> pnj, it is, isn't it :)
[08:41:05] <brunoais> pnj, use my ideology
[08:41:09] <decx> BillCriswell do you know about animation-play-state? http://jsfiddle.net/decx/uS6wP/
[08:41:16] <pnj> which is what, brunoais ?
[08:41:21] <brunoais> if the browser does not implement, I don't give a thamn
[08:41:22] <MikeD_> that could be a blessing though... if it drives people to give up the old busted browsers
[08:41:47] <hk3380> jphase: hm, i found some "-webkit-transition: all .3s linear;" lines, but apparently deleting/changing them has no effect
[08:41:49] <pnj> I don't  think that is always an option though
[08:42:02] <brunoais> for me it's never a problem
[08:42:03] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha nice. Seems useful.
[08:42:05] <pnj> client says, "we must have this functionality..."
[08:42:12] <brunoais> everything I do "works" without js
[08:42:30] <brunoais> it may not have the best looks or use experience (sometimes it is actually bad)
[08:42:31] <decx> i was about to rewrite my keyframes to js animation when i found out about this. just saved me a few hours
[08:42:32] <brunoais> but it works
[08:43:12] <sadtaco> nevermind
[08:43:12] <brunoais> all I do even works without CSS although, sometimes, it's not trivial to read
[08:43:19] <BillCriswell> decx: There's so many cool thing I discover way too late.
[08:43:30] <brunoais> but the browsers ususally does not render senseless;useless without CSS
[08:43:32] <decx> todays lucky 10000
[08:44:18] <pnj> how does one save jsfiddles with a 'real' name?
[08:44:21] <hk3380> jphase: oh nevermind, it worked after i deleted all the occurences in all the files. cheers man <3
[08:44:33] <pnj> mine just have the generic name given when saved
[08:44:34] <decx> fiddle options pnj
[08:44:45] <ShooterMG> Anyone know how I might use jQuery to take a text hyperlink, and replace it with an image link of the same href?
[08:44:58] <BillCriswell> Man, I still have accordions.
[08:44:59] <decx> if you save a named fiddle as the base it becomes public though
[08:45:05] <pnj> wow, i'm an idiot. thanks decx
[08:45:37] <pnj> i don't understand what you mean, "as the base" decx
[08:45:55] <decx> if you update the number increases
[08:46:04] <decx> but you can set as base to go back to the root
[08:46:28] <decx> and if a root fiddle is named it's public on your profile
[08:46:47] <pnj> ah.
[08:46:57] <pnj> being public doesn't bother me, I don't think...
[08:46:59] <thaifood> Hi
[08:47:17] <pnj> I can't imagine anyone needing my code
[08:47:18] <decx> well don't save any sensitive data as public
[08:47:23] <pnj> ^ right
[08:47:25] <thaifood> Anyone know how to delete Objects from an array?  http://fpaste.org/104149/07718921/
[08:47:41] <decx> generally splice(remove#,1)
[08:47:57] <thaifood> is that jquery or javascript ?
[08:48:07] <decx> yes
[08:48:12] <BillCriswell> decx: Good answer.
[08:48:19] <thaifood> hmm
[08:48:26] <thaifood> ninja mind tricks
[08:48:43] <BillCriswell> thaifood: You need to get the index the object with that id and splice.
[08:48:51] <thaifood> but i need to do it based on the key
[08:48:59] <decx> an array doesnt have keys
[08:49:06] <decx> in js
[08:49:06] <thaifood> the object key
[08:49:16] <thaifood> http://fpaste.org/104149/07718921/
[08:49:18] <BillCriswell> thaifood: I said that. =)
[08:49:26] <thaifood> they are associative
[08:49:45] <BillCriswell> thaifood: Not what they're in.
[08:50:06] <thaifood> ok i'm lost
[08:50:18] <thaifood> i need to go back to good old vars :-)
[08:50:23] <thaifood> they never let me down
[08:50:27] <BillCriswell> for( var i = 0; i < items.length; i++ ) { var item = items[i]; if ( item.id === '234 ) { items.splice(i, 1); });
[08:51:10] <decx> thaifood http://jsfiddle.net/decx/hU68F/
[08:51:24] <thaifood> yeah that's a bit much, hmm i wonder if i can change the object mumbo jumbo to a nice simple json string
[08:51:45] <pnj> wtf is wurst?
[08:51:49] <BillCriswell> a bit much?
[08:51:50] <pnj> liverwurst.
[08:51:56] <thaifood> liverwurst !
[08:52:06] <MikeD_> bratwurst
[08:52:12] <decx> why would you use english and german in one word
[08:52:28] <pnj> dunno but I hate when people do that
[08:52:33] <decx> either liversausage or leberwurst
[08:52:48] <decx> liverbaloney`? ^^
[08:52:51] <pnj> is it a german-american thing?
[08:52:57] <thaifood> Is is possible to convert this to a simple json string?  http://fpaste.org/104160/14007739/
[08:53:13] <MikeD_> german american... is that like "PA Dutch" is actually german?
[08:53:28] <systemfault> thaifood: JSON.stringify(myArray)
[08:53:51] <thaifood> ahh much prettier
[08:53:52] <BillCriswell> thaifood: You're going the wrong way.
[08:53:58] <thaifood> hahaha
[08:54:01] <thaifood> turn around ?
[08:54:09] <decx> wurst is also a colloquially description for "it doesn'T matter"
[08:54:20] <decx> i don't care - mir doch wurst
[08:54:41] <pnj> no idea MikeD_ just thinking of people that came to the USA from germany, way back when
[08:54:43] <decx> so it's perfect for fiddle variables ^^
[08:55:15] <decx> i think baloney is similar in english?
[08:55:27] <thaifood> it's easier to iterate all those objects and remove stuff ?
[08:55:28] <pnj> i'm no engliish major
[08:55:35] <thaifood> i thought the json string might be easier
[08:57:00] <thaifood> which of these takes less code to remove the obj or key/val where id=2 for example.  http://fpaste.org/104161/74174140/
[08:57:23] <decx> you have to loop through either way
[08:57:37] <thaifood> i was afraid of that
[08:57:48] <thaifood> ok so you'd stick with the objects it seems
[08:57:55] <BillCriswell> Why are you afraid of looping?
[08:58:14] <thaifood> i'm trying to do it on one line if possible, like plucking a flower :-)
[08:58:24] <decx> what kind of object is that anyway with the = ?
[08:58:30] <BillCriswell> You mean killing a flower?
[08:58:33] <decx> that's not an object. that's a spacestation
[08:58:42] <BillCriswell> =D
[08:58:42] <thaifood> yeah killing a flower
[08:59:11] <thaifood> thanks, i'll do it your way.  i appreciate it,  lunch everyone !
[09:02:33] <BillCriswell> thaifood: You can create your own indexOf that takes a function if you want a one liner.
[09:05:26] <skullcrasher> any docs about "class-like" plugin development?
[09:05:39] <skullcrasher> i only found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1117086/how-to-create-a-jquery-plugin-with-methods
[09:05:49] <skullcrasher> and this http://club15cc.com/code/jquery/an-improved-version-of-the-jquery-plugin-template
[09:07:07] <jop008> what is the way to get 1.9.1 in min.js flavor?
[09:08:02] <decx> there's a great answer on that stack already skullcrasher
[09:10:42] <JustMozzy> has anyone ever seen such a comment in a js? "//= require bootstrap"
[09:14:22] <BillCriswell> jop008: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js
[09:14:39] <jop008> thanks
[09:14:42] <jop008> found
[09:15:42] <pnj> I need to buy a nose hair trimmer
[09:15:45] <pnj> i feel old
[09:15:50] <andrew9183> lol i have two
[09:15:55] <andrew9183> but sometimes resort to scissors
[09:16:21] <pnj> any suggstions for buying one?
[09:16:37] <pnj> i'm thinking 15 bucks is my limit
[09:16:37] <andrew9183> they all do the same thing
[09:16:43] <skullcrasher> decx: ok
[09:16:46] <jphase> lol, what on earth? this is just delightfully off topic lol
[09:17:04] <skullcrasher> im also just looking through the twitter bootstrap plugins
[09:17:14] <skullcrasher> they use a similar approach to my 2nd link
[09:17:34] <jphase> $('trimmers > hairs[location="nose"]').val();
[09:17:39] <pnj> battery or rechargable, andrew9183 ?
[09:17:53] <andrew9183> battery
[09:18:06] <andrew9183> with rechargeable batteries :D
[09:18:41] <decx> that isnt semantic jphase trimmers isn't a parent of hairs, and hairs can't have a nose attribute
[09:18:55] <jphase> I was waiting for that :P
[09:19:02] <decx> $('hair','#nose').trimmer() fyi
[09:19:07] <jphase> I was like "well... too late now... some nerd is going to correct me"
[09:19:08] <jphase> lol
[09:19:15] <decx> ^^
[09:19:22] <jphase> decx++;
[09:19:37] <andrew9183> srsly
[09:20:04] <pnj> ahhaha, too funny
[09:20:25] <sadtaco> Ehh. How I'm trying to get index of $(this).closest('.or').index('.or') but from the index of the list of .or to be limited to a close group of them, and not every one on the page
[09:20:37] <andrew9183> i need a nice spring jacket
[09:20:40] <pnj> thanks for the laugh and help. i've gotta run
[09:20:49] <andrew9183> sadtaco: is that a question or a fact
[09:20:54] <sadtaco> I tried $(this).closest('.or').index( $(this).closest('.parent').find('.or') ); but that iddn't work.
[09:21:00] <sadtaco> I have no idea how I wrote that like that
[09:21:18] <andrew9183> sorry i don't understand your question
[09:21:24] <sadtaco> Take out the How. add ". How do I do that?"
[09:21:49] <decx> so get the index of .or?
[09:21:55] <jphase> sadtaco: the problem is, we don't know what "the list is" and the .or classname is a bit arbitrary. can you make a fiddle?
[09:22:08] <sadtaco> <div class="parent"><div class="or">foo</div></div> <div class="parent"><div class="or">bar</div></div>
[09:22:23] <jphase> and $(this) is an .or element?
[09:22:23] <sadtaco> I need the index of .or containing bar relative to its parent.
[09:22:30] <sadtaco> No. It's something inside .or
[09:22:40] <andrew9183> why do you need the index ?
[09:22:44] <jphase> $(this).closest('.or').index()
[09:22:47] <sadtaco> For my code to work, andrew :)
[09:22:59] <sadtaco> jphase, that won't work with non-.or elements in the parent with it
[09:23:12] <jphase> oic
[09:23:24] <jphase> then you honestly need the index of the parent
[09:23:28] <jphase> with an or in it
[09:23:28] <andrew9183> make a jsfiddle and ill get it to work for you
[09:23:32] <sadtaco> I need the index of the .or element, relative to the other .or element, within its container
[09:24:11] <jphase> $(this).closest('.parent').has('.or').index();  possibly?
[09:24:18] <sadtaco> I can .index( '.parent:eq('+$(this).closest('.parent').index+' .or') but that's unelegant as fuck
[09:24:52] <sadtaco> I don't understand why  $(this).closest('.or').index( $(this).closest('.parent').find('.or') ); doesn't work. It shoul according to the docs. Oh well I guess.
[09:25:15] <andrew9183> can we please make a fiddle of this? code in the chat hurts my head.
[09:25:24] <andrew9183> and its channel rules to use jsfiddle
[09:25:33] <decx> $('.or').index($(this).closest('.or')) ?
[09:25:43] <NoiseEee> fiddle or gtfo
[09:25:48] <andrew9183> yes
[09:26:05] <jphase> sadtaco: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/P3T9g/
[09:27:00] <sadtaco> That's not right.
[09:27:06] <sadtaco> It's saying index 1 for bar when it should be 0
[09:27:23] <jphase> well then with this structure you're always going to get 0 my friend
[09:28:09] <jphase> since the index of .or is always 0 - since there's only 1 in its parent
[09:28:30] <sadtaco> .index( '.parent:eq('+$(this).closest('.parent').index+' .or') works but it's ugly and probably slow.
[09:29:09] <andrew9183> sadtaco: JSFIDDLE.
[09:29:15] <andrew9183> don't be an asshat
[09:29:19] <jphase> and at this point I've lost you
[09:29:20] * jphase goes back to breakfast
[09:29:32] <sadtaco> I don't really see why I need one. I think it's just that no one knows.
[09:29:50] <jphase> sadtaco: no one can visualize wtf you're talking about, that doesn't mean they don't know
[09:29:56] <andrew9183> its because you aren't explaining what you want exactly.
[09:29:57] <jphase> if you noticed, it took me 2 seconds to make one for you, use that one
[09:30:02] <sadtaco> What I'm asking is pretty simple.  How do I get an index for a class, relative to the classes of a container containing those classes, instead of relative to all children or all classes on that page.
[09:30:25] <andrew9183> that sentence is confusing.  why not demonstrate your working example ?
[09:30:32] <jphase> because that'd be too simple
[09:30:47] <jphase> "When I click _____ I want to get this number _____"
[09:32:15] <sadtaco> http://jsfiddle.net/P3T9g/1/
[09:33:03] <sadtaco> $(this).closest('.or').index( $(this).closest('.parent').find('.or') ); this SHOULD work according to the docs, but doesn't.
[09:33:15] <sadtaco> Which is slightly more elegant.
[09:34:04] <jphase> sadtaco: so you want the index of the .or within the closest .parent then yes? That's at least what that code is doing, but you say it doesn't work? What number are you expecting - give me a use-case
[09:34:21] <sadtaco> The code on the jsfiddle works.
[09:34:25] <sadtaco> It's just ugly and probably slow
[09:34:28] <jphase> k
[09:34:50] <sadtaco> I wanted to do that but by supplying a list of elements to get the index from IE  $(this).closest('.or').index( $(this).closest('.parent').find('.or') );
[09:36:52] <jphase> oic, so the non-or div is the problem then with your index being off with just, $(this).index() ?
[09:38:52] <jphase> sadtaco: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/P3T9g/2/
[09:39:06] <jphase> yay for fiddles! :P
[09:39:45] <sadtaco> Hm. That's a way to do it.  Easier toread, but more lines of code.
[09:40:03] <jphase> then do it in one big ass run-on sentence for all I care
[09:40:15] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/P3T9g/3/
[09:40:34] <jphase> I personally like to not penalize future developers when reading my code, to each his/her own
[09:42:26] <duch_kazatel> "more lines of code" isn't necessarily a bad thing.
[09:42:35] <rudetaco> agreed
[09:43:34] <duch_kazatel> clear, concise code that makes appropriate use of things like abstraction is definitely better imo.
[09:43:43] <BillCriswell> The update to OSX 10.9.3 feels nice and snappy.
[09:43:49] <jphase> inorite!
[09:43:55] <jphase> made my experience much more friendly
[09:44:17] <sadtaco> It helps when you're dealing with thousands that would be tens of thousands without trying to compact things. :/
[09:44:20] <jphase> that and finally switching chrome's default search engine to duckduckgo
[09:44:36] <BillCriswell> jphase: Mmm hmm.
[09:44:47] <BillCriswell> I tried doing it on my phone it doesn't seem possible.
[09:45:09] <BillCriswell> In safari or chrome.
[09:45:27] <jphase> I think I'm going to start making a list of folks to not help due to lack of appreciation :s
[09:45:43] <jphase> oh, the default search engine?
[09:45:51] <duch_kazatel> sadtaco huh?
[09:45:55] <jphase> you has iOS phone BillCriswell?
[09:45:58] <BillCriswell> jphase: I've already basically done that based on question quality.
[09:45:58] <jop008> when working with jquuery mobile 1.4.2 what is the best jquery version to use?
[09:46:01] <BillCriswell> jphase: YEs.
[09:46:21] <jphase> I'm too broke and ghetto for the extra $20/mo., but I think they're sexy
[09:46:38] <sadtaco> It becomes hard to be clear and concise with something that'd be tens of thousands of lines if it were clear and concise.
[09:46:39] <duch_kazatel> jop008 from their site: http://i.imgur.com/KtsWQ7o.png
[09:46:56] <jop008> but which version?
[09:47:09] <duch_kazatel> sadtaco 25% of my frontend codebase for one of our applications is javascript.  thousands upon thousands of lines.
[09:47:17] <jop008> I have jqm 1.4.2 already
[09:47:27] <duch_kazatel> jop008 right - right below the version number ;)
[09:47:27] <jop008> now the jqeury version
[09:47:35] <duch_kazatel> jQuery 1.8 - 1.10 / 2.0
[09:47:55] <duch_kazatel> sadtaco you might not be able to fix everything, but you can certainly start making it better today :)
[09:48:27] <jop008> so it is not dependend on each other every version is possible
[09:48:49] <jphase> <rant> yeah... and ppl that don't comment their code should die in a fire </rant>
[09:48:50] <duch_kazatel> jop008 it's dependent on you using 1.8 - 1.10 or 2.0
[09:49:08] <skullcrasher> can anybody tell me if this is a reasonable starting point? https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate
[09:49:35] <jop008> so with mobile 1.4.2 I can use jquery 2.0?
[09:49:49] <duch_kazatel> jop008 sure, but only if you don't need to support older IE.
[09:50:06] <duch_kazatel> jphase aye.  i only allow people to pass CR without code comments if their variable names and function names make sense.
[09:50:09] <jop008> what is the one with old ie support?
[09:50:12] <duch_kazatel> and they're abstracting sanelyu.
[09:50:20] <duch_kazatel> jop008 the 1.x series supports old IE.
[09:50:23] <duch_kazatel> you want 1.10
[09:50:40] <jop008> okay
[09:50:44] <jop008> thx
[09:51:15] <jphase> agreed. back in the "olden days" we were required to have function names using a convention that was like function this_function_charges_credit_cards() {  ...
[09:51:35] <jphase> ppl these days are basically one step away from minified code, drives me nuts
[09:51:50] <sadtaco> ?:)
[09:52:10] <duch_kazatel> jphase right?!  let the minifier take care of shortening shit.  don't make me guess what your name means - "idx" makes me die every time.
[09:52:17] <jphase> srsly!!!! AMEN!
[09:52:28] <jphase> that's what they ARE FOR!
[09:52:29] <duch_kazatel> autocomplete exists for a reason.
[09:52:32] <duch_kazatel> :D
[09:54:00] <jphase> and honestly, if a carriage return is "unneeded bytes" in your code, then you should be coding something low level like some C language or assembler
[09:54:15] <jphase> minifiers fix it even if you aren't... bah, now I'm all worked up
[09:54:54] <duch_kazatel> hah - it's all good :)
[09:54:56] <sadtaco> It actually helps readability in a single line is doing something really meaningful.
[09:55:06] <sadtaco> Instead of needing 10 lines before you get what you're looking for
[09:55:39] <duch_kazatel> sadtaco i disagree completely.  it's highly circumstantial, but in general, linebreaks increase readability.
[09:55:42] <jphase> doing arithmetic and ternary operators = good use of one liners.... cramming computations into one run on sentence that makes folks using word wrap hate you is not
[09:55:48] <duch_kazatel> ^^
[09:55:58] <duch_kazatel> i still shoot for 80 chars/line
[09:56:05] <duch_kazatel> not a hard rule, but a good one to keep in mind.
[09:56:09] <duch_kazatel> and vars are cheap.
[09:56:27] <jphase> memory is your friend - just don't use global namespaces :)
[09:56:38] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[09:56:58] <jop008> jquery-1.10.2.min.js works with IE old also?
[09:57:05] <jphase> jop008: yes
[09:57:13] <duch_kazatel> jop008 yes.  the 1.x series keeps support for old ie.
[09:57:15] <jop008> okay
[09:57:18] <duch_kazatel> the 2.x series drops it.
[09:57:23] <duch_kazatel> they are maintained in tandem.
[09:57:31] <jphase> jop008: http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[10:00:28] <jphase> duch_kazatel: you dabble in node at all? I see BillCriswell in that channel from time to time, wondering if there are other noders here.
[10:00:59] <bberry> is it possible to fire the setter function of a property if property inside that property is being set? (kind of confusing, heres an example) http://jsfiddle.net/N4s7K/2/
[10:01:03] <matheusrocha89> I am having problem with jquerymobile and galaxy S4
[10:01:28] <duch_kazatel> jphase i hang out over there - I want to play with it more.  i REALLY like the idea of hood.ie, but i'm a DOS'er and it's busted ATM :(
[10:01:52] <jphase> white hat or black or grey?
[10:02:12] <duch_kazatel> (I mean't windows)
[10:02:15] <matheusrocha89> When I click in a listview item that have a link to other page when i click on back button on toolbar the item that I clicked still active, somebody knows what it is and how to fix?
[10:02:15] <jphase> oh gotcha
[10:02:16] <jphase> haha
[10:02:18] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[10:02:31] <BillCriswell> jphase: I do. Still a lot to learn about it, though.
[10:02:33] <duch_kazatel> bberry you mean watch an object and fire logic when you change a prop?
[10:02:40] <BillCriswell> Went through nodeschool.io which was kind of fun.
[10:02:59] <BillCriswell> Though what they wanted you to do was poorly worded at times ( in my opinion ).
[10:03:03] <jphase> BillCriswell: seems once I learn one thing pandora's box opens right up to 10 others...  <3 it though
[10:03:31] <bberry> duch_kazatel yep, that works
[10:03:36] <duch_kazatel> bberry you can't ;)
[10:03:44] <duch_kazatel> bberry that's why you use getters and setters.
[10:03:52] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, you can't "watch" an object for changes.
[10:04:09] <bberry> but that means i have to have getters and setters on every property recursively
[10:04:35] <duch_kazatel> you could also create a function that proxies all of that for you.
[10:04:58] <duch_kazatel> without knowing what your use case it, it's hard to suggest a solution though.
[10:05:42] <BillCriswell> jphase: Yeah. I've been trying to stick with  node.
[10:06:43] <jphase> been dabbling in restify, sails.js and redis. pretty sexy stuff. waterline seems to be a god send
[10:07:39] <jphase> although I must say, it's pretty confusing to go from a SQL background to key stores and NoSQL - have to completely change the way you think about db architecture. makes me feel like a nub again :(
[10:07:58] <duch_kazatel> jphase but isn't that part of the fun? :)
[10:08:02] <duch_kazatel> you keep learning.
[10:08:06] <jphase> agreed
[10:08:28] <matheusrocha89> somebody?
[10:08:48] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ matheusrocha89
[10:08:48] <b-ot> matheusrocha89: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:08:52] <BillCriswell> jphase: YEah I've using using sails too.
[10:09:03] <BillCriswell> jphase: My biggest issues are I can't stick to making anything.
[10:09:18] <BillCriswell> Whatever I try usually works, which is awesome, but I have no... direction.
[10:09:21] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell you're like a fucking wizard jack of all trades.  you just do shit.
[10:09:26] <jphase> same here - or when I finally start getting traction on a project I've learned 100 other things and start from scratch
[10:09:30] <BillCriswell> It's actually painful at times.
[10:09:52] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha that sounds about right.
[10:10:02] <duch_kazatel> it's p. awesome.
[10:10:04] <jphase> hehe, shit doers are great :)
[10:10:17] <duch_kazatel> word
[10:10:20] <BillCriswell> Would like to get as comfortable with server side JS as I am with client side.
[10:10:32] <BillCriswell> I really need a goal in mind to get anything done though.
[10:10:58] <jphase> it's already made my client side JS wayyyyyyy better after being forced to master async and callbacks and nested object madness
[10:11:23] <bberry> duch_kazatel: yeah.... i have an object liks var project = { gauges: [array of gauges], charts: [array of charts], general: {object with properties like project name and stuff (1 layer deep afaik) } };  I need to monitor all the objects properties for each gauge, all the objects properties for each chart, and all the properties in the general object.  When any of those properties has change,
[10:11:24] <bberry> or if a gauge/chart has been deleted, etc, etc, then i need to tell the user that he needs to 'save' the project. (saving means to stringify the object and send it to the server). so i need to have an event on the setters ( of all those properties? fuuuu) to display the "Your project has changed, save it!" message.
[10:11:27] <bberry> wow that was long
[10:11:33] <duch_kazatel> woah...
[10:11:52] <bberry> but thats my use case loll
[10:11:52] <BillCriswell> jphase: Yeah, understanding that stuff is great.
[10:12:22] <jphase> bberry: well, you get points for being descriptive :P
[10:12:30] <duch_kazatel> bberry yeah, you just need to setup a series of proxied functions so you can tell that function what you're updating, and the new value, and let it handle the rest.
[10:13:02] <duch_kazatel> that's how i'd approach it at least.
[10:13:18] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you're looking at a bunch of constructors to craft objects so they inherit those methods.
[10:15:03] <duch_kazatel> this is where partials and currying come in handy :)
[10:15:27] <bberry> jphase: haha :P
[10:15:56] <duch_kazatel> this mootools abatement project is making me hate mootools more and more.
[10:16:35] <bberry> duch_kazatel blegh okay. i think im just going to say screw it and do it the bad way.
[10:16:40] <duch_kazatel> "the bad way"?
[10:16:41] <jphase> mmmm currying
[10:16:50] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I'm working with HTML emails and print stylesheets today. It could be worse.
[10:16:56] <bberry> duch_kazatel im adding onto my coworkers code that is complete garbage. unfortunately, its like 4000 lines or something ridiculous
[10:17:18] <duch_kazatel> bberry O.O i'd abstract out the relevant bits at that point.
[10:17:21] <duch_kazatel> and go to town.
[10:18:00] <bberry> finding the relevant bits is the hard part haha
[10:18:10] <bberry> you should see this code
[10:18:11] <duch_kazatel> that's where you should probably start then.
[10:18:13] <bberry> it is hilarious
[10:18:29] <bberry> the 'bad' way is almost unspeakable
[10:18:31] <duch_kazatel> oh i'm sure it's bad - i've got one that's still kicking around that's running our search that's fucking terrible.
[10:18:39] <duch_kazatel> it was one of those "get it done asap" deals.
[10:18:40] <bberry> lol
[10:19:05] <bberry> the 'bad' way that i 'could' do is keep a copy of the object, and check every few seconds to see if its changed lol
[10:19:07] <bberry> on a timer
[10:19:12] <duch_kazatel> no.
[10:19:16] <duch_kazatel> don't do that :(
[10:19:22] <bberry> lol
[10:19:25] <bberry> yes. that is terrible.
[10:19:31] <bberry> but itd fit in with the rest of the code!
[10:19:49] <bberry> i could say i was trying to "keep the theme"
[10:19:49] <duch_kazatel> you're just adding more bad to stuff.  be a boy scout - leave it better than you found it :)
[10:20:38] <duch_kazatel> return (Math.round(theNumber * 100)) / 100; - i feel like there's a method I'm forgetting that'll accomplish this without coercing type.
[10:20:57] <bberry> haha i hsoudl
[10:21:45] <Cork> duch_kazatel: there isn't
[10:21:55] <duch_kazatel> :(
[10:21:58] <Cork> the closest that exist is toFixed()
[10:22:03] <Cork> but it will convert it to a string
[10:22:05] <duch_kazatel> but that coerces to a string.
[10:22:06] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[10:22:10] <Cork> and it has other limitations too
[10:22:13] <duch_kazatel> aye.
[10:23:18] <Cork> duch_kazatel: the reason i'm so sure about it is that i spent quite a bit of time researching it for a project ~ 4months back :)
[10:23:38] <Cork> and ended up with basically the code you just pasted
[10:23:55] <duch_kazatel> i'm rewriting this calculator to remove the mootools requirement and saw that bit and remembered why i hate math.
[10:24:18] <Cork> duch_kazatel: what's so bad about that line?
[10:24:31] <duch_kazatel> i just feel like there should be a .toFixed() for numbers.
[10:24:34] <duch_kazatel> i get why there isn't.
[10:24:39] <duch_kazatel> but it "feels" awkward in a way.
[10:24:46] <duch_kazatel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViHIk5kqynw - sometimes this is how i feel when working in my codebase.
[10:25:16] <Cork> duch_kazatel: well you can't really do toFixed with numbers
[10:25:27] <Cork> all you can do is round to number of decimals
[10:25:35] <skullcrasher> is there a simpler possibility to call functions like here http://jsfiddle.net/4SqZb/
[10:25:43] <duch_kazatel> Cork yeah i get the reasoning.
[10:25:43] <BillCriswell> That hail is terrifying.
[10:25:44] <duch_kazatel> i'm lazy.
[10:25:45] <yakko> duch_kazatel: that is so fucking funny
[10:25:56] <skullcrasher> with binding of events
[10:27:27] <Cork> duch_kazatel: what on earth s that guy doing??
[10:27:37] <Cork> hail?
[10:27:44] <duch_kazatel> either he's REALLY drunk, or he's trying to protect his car.
[10:27:46] <yakko> Cork: yeah, he's trying to protect his car
[10:27:51] <Cork> ...
[10:28:01] <yakko> protect the car, that's what the title translates
[10:28:05] <duch_kazatel> aaaah
[10:28:31] <yakko> duch_kazatel: I'm originally from Brazil, the title is in Portuguese
[10:28:43] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah.  learn something new every day :)
[10:28:48] <duch_kazatel> yakko++
[10:28:49] <Cork> he is prob making more damage then the hail would do if he just let it be...
[10:29:01] <yakko> I just came in the channel looking for a way to improve something on my code base
[10:29:17] <duch_kazatel> that video is almost as good as this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IAXrxlDK6c
[10:29:30] <yakko> so that ACTUALLY makes me feel like myself trying to save our code in here lol
[10:29:53] <Cork> duch_kazatel: ah, that one
[10:29:59] <Cork> old, but good
[10:30:45] <dman777_alter> with jquery-ui datepicker, is it possible to grab the url query string and populate it in the input boxes of the from/to dates?
[10:30:51] <duch_kazatel> "
[10:31:02] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[10:31:04] <duch_kazatel> should be.
[10:31:30] <Cork> duch_kazatel: this one is quite good too... http://www.break.com/video/rolling-office-chairs-make-bad-stools-510670
[10:31:50] <yakko> duch_kazatel: that song is really appropriate lol
[10:31:55] <duch_kazatel> :)
[10:32:05] <dman777_alter> well, what I should ask is how to I poopulate the from/to input boxes dates in datepicker? on the docs it only has a api to set a default date for both boxes...not allowing me to set the boxes seperately.
[10:32:09] <yakko> duch_kazatel: what about you, where are you from?
[10:32:48] <duch_kazatel> the Real Northern California.  San Francisco is about 4 hours south of me.
[10:33:02] <yakko> duch_kazatel: sounds chilly =)
[10:33:13] <duch_kazatel> not in the slightest - i'm in the valley, not the mountains.
[10:33:34] <yakko> then I guess it sounds dry :)
[10:33:52] <duch_kazatel> we get down to the 30's in the winters.  though this past one we had a crazy cold stap down in the 10s.  but our summers are absurd.  and VERY dry this year, though we usually get a good amount of rain.
[10:34:22] <yakko> oh Cali.... all the seasons of the world in a single state
[10:34:57] <duch_kazatel> :) yep.  i can drive to snow and come back to sunshine in one day.
[10:35:47] <yakko> I lived in Atlanta for a while last year, so you can go to Stone Mountain and check the snow any time of year
[10:36:00] <duch_kazatel> very nice.
[10:36:08] <yakko> they fabricate snow at night time, it's freak
[10:36:31] <yakko> now I'm up north so snow comes to me in winter regardless what
[10:36:34] <yakko> :(
[10:37:19] <duch_kazatel> that's gotta be a big change for you.
[10:37:39] <yakko> it is, very dry where I grew up
[10:43:42] <jop008> Is there a way to write some text in the header at a cetain position jSQM142
[10:43:58] <duch_kazatel> "at a certain position" - be more specific?
[10:44:28] <jop008> for example at the left
[10:44:45] <jop008> and at the right not making use of a button just straight text
[10:45:10] <marc_v92> jop008: Are you speaking in relation to its parent element, or the window itself?
[10:45:33] <jop008> in relation to the header left
[10:45:41] <jop008> position
[10:46:16] <jop008> Show the username and another fixed setting for instance
[10:47:01] <duch_kazatel> jop008 so you just want to add an element to the page - that's easy.
[10:47:25] <jop008> but it must be part of the headerelement
[10:47:39] <duch_kazatel> right - you want to .append() something.
[10:48:12] <jop008> Yes show settings to the user so he is aware of whre he is or what he has selected
[10:48:18] <duch_kazatel> wut.
[10:48:24] <duch_kazatel> your question has changed.
[10:49:12] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/E5MRa/
[10:49:32] <jop008> in what way?
[10:49:59] <duch_kazatel> dunno what "settings" has to do with anything - that fiddle is how you append stuff.
[10:51:34] <jop008> any one an example for switching language a flag in the header maybe?
[10:51:53] <duch_kazatel> jop008 huh?
[10:52:05] <duch_kazatel> learn.jquery.com <- start here.
[10:53:15] <jop008> LOL
[10:53:38] <duch_kazatel> you're asking lots of basic questions - start with the basics.
[10:54:30] <jop008> LOL
[10:55:24] <duch_kazatel> oh this guy again. i remember you - you were building out that rental properties site and kept coming back here asking the same questions over and over.
[10:55:53] <decx> iirc js dev for 50 years
[10:56:42] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha i remember that!
[10:56:54] <duch_kazatel> kept acting like we're all noobs
[10:59:03] <duch_kazatel> looks like he's back now with more basic questions.  gettin' too old for this shit.
[11:00:11] <jop008> In only found coumentation on buttons in a header bar not plain text
[11:00:33] <duch_kazatel> you're asking how to change text - learn.jquery.com will teach you that AND much more!
[11:01:15] <bberry> lol...
[11:02:13] <BillCriswell> I fucking hate CSS right now.
[11:02:58] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell such a love/hate relationship with it :(
[11:03:11] <marc_v92> BillCriswell: Is it CSS that you hate, or IE‚Äôs botched implementation of it?
[11:03:27] <decx> i heard it's printstyle day
[11:03:52] <decx> wouldve already seppukued myself
[11:03:57] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell print and email css is a totally awful beast.
[11:04:39] <BillCriswell> It's just someone elses code piled on top of HTML I can't manipulate easily making things that should take minutes take way longer.
[11:04:47] <duch_kazatel> :(
[11:05:21] <duch_kazatel> remember kids - don't tightly couple things together as much as possible!
[11:07:28] <kenny__> hey may i ask one of u guys to help real quick with a JSONP question? will paypal you $20, its like one line i have an issue with
[11:07:31] <kenny__> $.ajax({   url: "http://s3.amazonaws.com/bva_vitafrutemommerce/aff_directory.json?callback=?",   dataType: 'jsonp',     cache: true,     jsonpCallback: 'JsonWrapping' }).done(function() {  JsonWrapping(); });  function JsonWrapping(data) {        function linkReplace() {          $(".remodal a").attr("href", $adlink);          $(".remodal img").attr("src", $adimg);                          alert ($clientname);            if ( ! $.cooki
[11:07:41] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ kenny__
[11:07:41] <b-ot> kenny__: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:07:43] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ kenny__
[11:07:43] <kenny__> and receiving the error "data.moms[i[ is undefined"
[11:07:45] <kenny__> sorry
[11:07:46] <b-ot> kenny__: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:07:55] <kenny__> nice ok 1 sec
[11:08:33] <duch_kazatel> and if you don't use one of the three services that b-ot told you to use, i will not help you ;)
[11:09:20] <kenny__> setting it up now, thanks
[11:12:26] <aeiou> anyone know why mouse scroll events dont fire in Chrome when you are dragging something? for example I want to drag whilst I am using the up and down scroll wheel. If i drag a file over chrome or drag something from a different window it works fine, but not if I am dragging something in the same window
[11:15:31] <duch_kazatel> because you can't scroll while dragging in the first place.
[11:16:37] <kenny__> Hey guys - I'm having an issue with JSONP. The error I receive on the live site is 'data.moms[i] is not defined' - The JS Fiddle is located at http://jsfiddle.net/7X5bM/ - Will pay $ for assistance
[11:17:37] <duch_kazatel> kenny__ i'll take a look in a sec.
[11:18:38] <kenny__> Awesome duch , much appreciated
[11:19:01] <pawelbx> jQuery may not be handling abort() properly in IE 9
[11:19:55] <bberry> kenny__ i assume the error is from the line with the 'if' statement?
[11:20:14] <kenny__> yes
[11:20:25] <kenny__> Im trying to cycle through the JSON to find a specific 'client'
[11:20:28] <bengalo> kenny__ console.log(data), maybe data should be data[0]
[11:20:31] <kenny__> if themom == client
[11:20:34] <bengalo> or something like that
[11:20:36] <kenny__> then set the vars
[11:20:37] <kenny__> ok
[11:20:59] <bengalo> dunno what is returned but console.log will tell you if you have data.moms
[11:21:05] <pawelbx> It ends up calling the ajax error handler if i've called abort(). in the error handler, if i try to retrieve responseText i get error c00c023f
[11:21:16] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/7X5bM/2/
[11:21:22] <duch_kazatel> this has the data saved in it.
[11:21:50] <kenny__> yes
[11:22:05] <pawelbx> anyone have any ideas about c00c023f error?
[11:22:09] <shoky> kenny__: i is "moms"
[11:22:17] <shoky> kenny__: you're doing data.moms["moms"]
[11:22:53] <duch_kazatel> for (var i in data.moms) {
[11:22:56] <duch_kazatel> there's your fix ;)
[11:22:59] <bberry> instead of doing for ( var i in data), do for(var i in data.moms)
[11:23:04] <kenny__> wow
[11:23:09] <shoky> not for..in on an array, please
[11:23:13] <kenny__> ok lemme give it a shot :)
[11:23:19] <bberry>  also, yeah... probably shouldnt be using for in
[11:23:20] <shoky> for (var i = 0; i < data.moms.length; i++)
[11:23:26] <shoky> or $.each or whatever
[11:23:31] <duch_kazatel> shoky cache that length
[11:23:32] <kenny__> shoky - will this cycle through to make a match
[11:23:35] <shoky> yah
[11:23:44] <kenny__> nice - ok will give this a shot :) thank you
[11:23:47] <MikeD_> $.each() is so much nicer
[11:23:48] <shoky> kenny__ not sure what you just asked
[11:24:00] <duch_kazatel> for (var i = 0, momsLength = data.moms.length; i < momsLength; i++)
[11:24:09] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ and can also be slower depending.
[11:24:16] <bberry> duch_kazatel reverse that iteration!
[11:24:20] <bberry> lol
[11:24:31] <duch_kazatel> bberry accomplishes the same thing ;)
[11:24:35] <decx> oh my god, you helped kenny. good
[11:24:40] <MikeD_> i'm a patient man, i can spare a few ms
[11:24:41] <bberry> haha yeah, apparently reversing it is 'faster' on jsperf
[11:24:51] <duch_kazatel> yeah because you cache the length
[11:25:05] <unnu> how do i select all by a similar class that are not $(this)
[11:25:30] <decx> :not(this
[11:25:39] <decx> )
[11:25:59] <bberry> duch_kazatel no i mean going thru the array forward with length cached is slower than going thru the array backwards with length cached
[11:26:05] <unnu> $('.myclass').not(this).each(function(){ dostuff()});
[11:26:07] <unnu> ?
[11:26:19] <bberry> duch_kazatel i believe the difference is negligible though
[11:26:31] <decx> yes, not
[11:26:32] <unnu> thanks decx
[11:27:10] <duch_kazatel> bberry huh?  any proof for that?
[11:27:19] <duch_kazatel> because last i checked, it was the caching.
[11:27:42] <bberry> duch_kazatel its both
[11:27:44] <bberry> sec
[11:27:58] <duch_kazatel> http://jsperf.com/array-iteration-direction
[11:28:46] <duch_kazatel> so depending on browser.  interesting.
[11:29:57] <crash1hd> if $(this).val().indexOf("=") contains an equals it will return an number greater then 0 correct?
[11:30:13] <duch_kazatel> greater than -1
[11:31:29] <crash1hd> ok so if $(this).val() returns "small" then it would return -1
[11:31:34] <abishek> i need to find the width and height of an element that is hidden using jquery? how can i do it?
[11:32:25] <duch_kazatel> abishek define "hidden"
[11:32:28] <crash1hd> duch_kazatel, should $(this).val().indexOf("=") < 0  be the same as $(this).val().indexOf("=") === -1?
[11:32:39] <abishek> display:none
[11:32:42] <duch_kazatel> crash1hd huh?  what's the string?
[11:32:54] <duch_kazatel> abishek the element doesn't have a height or a width if it's display: none;
[11:32:59] <crash1hd> that would be the if statement
[11:33:00] <decx> doesnt matter if it's hidden, width() will return right
[11:33:07] <duch_kazatel> really?
[11:33:13] <decx> ye
[11:33:13] <kenny__> shoky / duch - IT WORKED! I love you, DM me your paypal emails
[11:33:19] <duch_kazatel> kenny__ no thanks.
[11:33:21] <duch_kazatel> :)
[11:33:22] <decx> that's why you can do width on fragments
[11:33:39] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah that's right because jquery is smarter than i am sometimes.
[11:33:41] <duch_kazatel> -_-
[11:36:54] <Vivekananda> hey everyone
[11:37:02] <Vivekananda> jphase around by any chance
[11:37:38] <degrex> hi how can i regex replace the same stuff in every string in an array of strings?
[11:37:41] <degrex> without looping over it really
[11:37:43] <degrex> is there a shortcut?
[11:37:51] <jphase> Vivekananda: hello
[11:37:52] <duch_kazatel> the g flag.
[11:37:58] <Vivekananda> if not and anyone else willing to gimme some advice I am trying to use his suggestion of
[11:38:00] <duch_kazatel> (/regex/g)
[11:38:10] <Vivekananda> hey sorry to ping you directly but got a min ?
[11:38:18] <jphase> hmmm, sure
[11:38:20] <degrex> duch_kazatel: i mean in an array of strings
[11:38:39] <duch_kazatel> degrex you can only run a regex on a string.
[11:38:54] <degrex> like $([,a,b,c]).each(someMagicHere)
[11:39:06] <frank_o> Hi, I got this mobile touch indicator + FastClick (polyfill to remove mobile click delays): http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/5k2NZ/9/embedded/result/
[11:39:09] <duch_kazatel> so you could stringify it and run it there and then re-arrayify it.
[11:39:09] <frank_o> But why, when I emulate say the iPhone 5 in Chrome dev tools, does the button become unclickable? Works fine otherwise.
[11:39:34] <Vivekananda> I have successfully used your idea of slideToggle to show hide a div but it is taking a hell of a lot time to show and hide a large div
[11:39:44] <degrex> oh maybe i should use map
[11:39:49] <Vivekananda> but if I used css : display block / display none on hover then it is so fast
[11:40:20] <Vivekananda> jphase: I am about to push up this new iteration and you can see for yourself what the problem is
[11:40:27] <degrex> map it is!
[11:40:33] <Vivekananda> will push up in a bit not right away though
[11:40:49] <Vivekananda> going to cook :(. But I wanted an input as to what I am doing wrong
[11:41:10] <jphase> Vivekananda: hmm, well css will is always be faster, but yeah, won't have the fancy animation
[11:41:23] <decx> eh frank_o how did your parallax thing turned out?
[11:41:24] <Vivekananda> jphase: currently dont wish animation at all
[11:41:30] <jphase> it shouldn't take a lot of time though, perhaps you're selecting a bunch of funny things?
[11:41:35] <decx> -ed
[11:41:36] <jphase> oh, then just use css
[11:41:37] <Vivekananda> speed is all I need for this and it is okay with 0 animation
[11:42:05] <Vivekananda> I dont know how to use it to show hide on CLIck . I know how to do on hover though
[11:42:12] <frank_o> decx: sorry which parallax thing?
[11:42:22] <frank_o> there was quite a few :)
[11:42:32] <decx> something parallax
[11:42:57] <decx> i only remember because it made me do my own try without plugins
[11:42:57] <frank_o> decx: it all worked out in the end :)
[11:43:12] <frank_o> like they say "if you want something bad enough the universe has a way of making sure it happens"
[11:43:27] <frank_o> cool
[11:43:33] <decx> frank_o http://jsfiddle.net/decx/mfpqY/
[11:43:47] <bberry> duch_kazatel tis interesting XD
[11:44:07] <frank_o> decx: holy moly !!
[11:44:36] <frank_o> decx: that is amazing.. what is that jurassic park 5?
[11:44:48] <decx> some render from a few years ago
[11:45:04] <decx> this demo actually got me some gigs for interactive page backgrounds. so thanks for the inspiration to retry parallax again ;)
[11:45:16] <sadtaco> How can I supply a dynamic list to autocomplete?  It's like instancing the array I send it, so when the array changes the autocomplete doesn't.  Resetting the source every time it changes would be a pain.
[11:45:27] <frank_o> nice :)
[11:46:55] <jeebster> does anyone know of services similar to this that can handle processing of bulk calendar event exporting? http://addthisevent.com/
[11:49:44] <Cork> sadtaco: you can give autocomplete a function for source
[11:50:00] <Cork> sadtaco: and you can give it anything you like through that
[11:50:02] <jphase> Vivekananda: well on click can still be done with jQuery's event handler and you can just use css or classnames to hide/show
[11:50:09] <sadtaco> And it runs the function each time? Alright
[11:50:16] <Cork> yes
[11:50:51] <Vivekananda> I found a bootstrap native class -- 'collapsible'
[11:50:54] <Vivekananda> am going to try it
[11:50:59] <Vivekananda> after saving this version
[11:51:12] <sadtaco> Doesn't seem to.  I tried source: function(){ return Object.keys(hash); }  and the source is empty
[11:53:13] <aeiou> anyone know why mouse scroll events dont fire in Chrome when you are dragging something? for example I want to drag whilst I am using the up and down scroll wheel. If i drag a file over chrome or drag something from a different window it works fine, but not if I am dragging something in the same window
[11:54:02] <Vivekananda> jphase: but currenly need to find out how to connect a checkbox with .... hmmm I guess it is easy :)
[12:54:31] <pnj> hi
[12:54:33] <pnj> http://jsfiddle.net/pnj4130/8NLB7/1/
[12:54:58] <pnj> what is wrong w/ the if statement? I thought I had this working this morning but must not have saved it.
[12:55:11] <pnj> code hint says code is fine but still, no worky...
[12:55:43] <duch_kazatel> pnj you can't run math operations on strings.
[12:56:46] <pnj> '250px' <-- that section?
[12:56:55] <duch_kazatel> pnj the entire line.
[12:57:11] <duch_kazatel> .css('left') returns '250px', and '300px' is a string.
[12:57:17] <duch_kazatel> you need to coerce each to a number.
[12:57:21] <duch_kazatel> check out parseInt()
[12:57:39] <pnj> hmm. i had it working in a simmilar manner this AM.
[12:57:46] <pnj> without parseInt()
[12:57:52] <decx> still with the interval :(
[12:57:56] <pnj> clearly, not the same way though cause this no worky.. :/
[12:58:05] <duch_kazatel> pnj right - you need numbers, not strings.
[12:58:06] <pnj> decx remembers. :)
[12:58:09] <duch_kazatel> and get right of that interval.
[12:58:29] <duch_kazatel> *rid
[13:11:14] <antlong> Hi, I'm looking to see if anyone would be interested in helping out with a jquery based game. www.multiverseminer.com It's a community developed game (about 15 people), and we could use a hand with implementing a couple of features. Excellent specs and docs, great time. #multiverseminer if you're interested.
[13:17:55] <naeluh_drnick> whoa is it thurs day already
[13:18:01] <duch_kazatel> right?!
[13:18:12] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[13:18:18] <naeluh_thurs> wher did the week go
[13:18:21] <naeluh_thurs> haha
[13:19:03] <naeluh_thurs> hey is there a specific room for canvas element stuff or would that just javascript ?
[13:19:27] <duch_kazatel> did you try running a /list *canvas* ?
[13:21:34] <naeluh_thurs> hmm doesnt look like there is anything like that in particular
[13:21:50] <duch_kazatel> lots of folks in here and ##javascript know stuff.
[13:22:04] <naeluh_thurs> let me put together my demo and maybe just put it out there
[13:22:09] <naeluh_thurs> yeah for sure
[13:28:21] <BillCriswell> It looks like a tsunami is coming in haha.
[13:29:16] <motaka2> hello I want to fadeIn a newly added dom but I dont know how. I mean I want something like: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7502931/
[13:35:09] <NoiseEee> motaka2: make sure its display:none when you append the DOM element
[13:35:12] <BillCriswell> Ugh, just came across a h3 { clear: left; }
[13:35:49] <motaka2> NoiseEee: I dont see the animation please check the code my freind
[13:36:04] <NoiseEee> motaka2: read what i said
[13:36:06] <liamkeily> I preferably want to load some html from another domain over ajax. (As appose to putting all the html in javascript with backslashes). Is it ok to do this with jsonp or is there  abetter way
[13:37:17] <duch_kazatel> liamkeily don't use json to transmit html...
[13:37:36] <liamkeily> well yeah i did think that..
[13:37:40] <duch_kazatel> either transmit data and then parse it to generate your markup, or transmit the markup alone.,
[13:38:29] <liamkeily> yeah would that not cause a problem with the browser expecting json though?
[13:38:37] <frank_o> anybody able to fully open jsfiddle in firefox 29.0.1 (latest)?
[13:38:51] <duch_kazatel> liamkeily you don't transmit it as json at that point.
[13:41:02] <motaka2> NoiseEee: done thank you
[13:44:25] <phlix> Anyone have an idea why on this page here. http://nationalmedicalsolutions.dev.tributemedia.com/ When you mouseover the head icon I am having it bind to my mouse so it will move and follow the mouse. but when you mouseover its appearing in the bottom right hand corner of the page. I can see the top and left class change as I move the mouse but the location is wrong. I am using position:Absolute;
[13:44:25] <phlix> any ideas?
[13:47:40] <duch_kazatel> phl because you're calculating wrong ;)
[13:48:01] <duch_kazatel> you want to appent that do the document instead.
[13:48:03] <duch_kazatel> *append
[13:48:08] <phelix> ahh, was thinking that it would magically get my location of where my mouse was at lol.
[13:48:55] <duch_kazatel> something tells me you've got some clears and floats going on, too.
[13:49:02] <phelix> yeah i do
[13:49:23] <phelix> maybe I'll just stick with it showing up on mouseover instead of having it follow the mouse around lol
[13:49:42] <duch_kazatel> or you can use powertip instead :)
[13:50:44] <phelix> its all good. it works fine how I have it now. Was just thinking it would be a bit easier. thank you though
[14:03:38] <Guddu> I am using jquery load to fetch content (HTTP POST internally)....Is there a way to set the X-CSRFToken on the request header for .load() calls?
[14:03:39] <uskerine> hi, how should I return a " sign in a Json object?
[14:04:59] <shoky> wat
[14:05:49] <duch_kazatel> Guddu use $.ajax() instead.
[14:05:59] <duch_kazatel> uskerine you're trying to escape the quote?
[14:06:03] <duch_kazatel> \" should work.
[14:07:55] <Guddu> duch_kazatel, I am using load as I am loading the content in a modal dialog when a hyperlink is clicked. Can this be done using .ajax?
[14:08:40] <uskerine> ok
[14:08:48] <uskerine> so my object should be something like
[14:09:09] <uskerine> "<div class=\"fooclass\">foo</div>"
[14:09:10] <uskerine> ?
[14:09:18] <shoky> :-o
[14:09:24] <duch_kazatel> Guddu yes
[14:10:03] <shoky> uskerine that's a string, but yes
[14:10:07] <duch_kazatel> uskerine or mix your quote types.
[14:10:22] <duch_kazatel> '<div class="fooclass">foo</div>'
[14:10:31] <Guddu> duch_kazatel, U mean I should look at loading the content in the complete function of .ajax?
[14:10:31] <duch_kazatel> but yeah, that's what your string would look like.
[14:11:01] <duch_kazatel> Guddu right, and then inserting it manually.  you could also look at setting the headers using .load(), but it'l be easier using $.ajax() imo.
[14:16:57] <uskerine> thanks
[14:17:08] <uskerine> mixing quotes seems easier
[14:22:30] <Guddu> duch_kazatel, I changed my logic to use .ajax to fetch the content. NOw I want to pass the HTML content to a Modal Dialog. I cannot figure out how to do this. Could you please guide?
[14:22:45] <liamkeily>  duch_kazatel, it seems using dataType:'jsonp' is the only way of using ajax cross-domain. It there an equivalent for raw html data?
[14:24:10] <duch_kazatel> liamkeily ... jsonp is for when the server you're fetching from doesn't support CORS.
[14:24:23] <duch_kazatel> Guddu do your work in the .done() handler.
[14:24:31] <duch_kazatel> .append() your data to the same place you were before.
[14:24:46] <Guddu> duch_kazatel, .done vs .success?
[14:24:59] <duch_kazatel> if you're using anything after around 1.8, using .done()
[14:25:10] <Guddu> duch_kazatel, I appended using $("#session_details").html(data); and it shows up on page. HOw can i do a poup now?
[14:25:18] <Guddu> duch_kazatel, Ok. WIll change it to .done now
[14:25:24] <liamkeily> duch_kazatel, oh thats interesting so i can use CORS to make resources available from another domain via ajax?
[14:25:33] <duch_kazatel> Guddu you mean a modal?
[14:25:43] <Guddu> duch_kazatel, Yes. Jquery Modeal
[14:25:51] <duch_kazatel> liamkeily yes - the server you're pulling content from must support CORS.
[14:26:14] <duch_kazatel> Guddu where were you appending your content before?
[14:26:48] <liamkeily> duch_kazatel, looks pretty simple actually it this something quite new?
[14:27:01] <duch_kazatel> liamkeily CORS?  no.  it's been around for a while.
[14:27:27] <duch_kazatel> Guddu because the only functional difference here is you're manually appending your content - what was your selector for .load()?
[14:27:59] <Guddu> duch_kazatel, I was doing this ---> http://www.dpaste.com/2K5MBVB/
[14:28:21] <duch_kazatel> then append to $("#session_details") within .done()
[14:39:01] <Guddu_> duch_kazatel, Thanks it works now. Is there a way to have the modal dialog buttons centred on the form.
[14:39:16] <duch_kazatel> i'd need to see it to know what you're talking about, Guddu_
[14:41:54] <Guddu_> duch_kazatel, http://imgur.com/Gn2tXPu If you see the Close button (Cerrar) is right aligned. Also the window is not big enough to show the text without wrapping at times. Is there a option to specify % in the modal window width?
[14:42:12] <duch_kazatel> margin: 0 auto; on the button maybe.
[14:42:33] <duch_kazatel> and what's that about %?
[14:43:56] <Guddu_> duch_kazatel, minWidth: 700 is what I have at the moment.
[14:44:15] <Guddu_> duch_kazatel, TO control styling of modal dialog elements, I will have to write a separate CSS u mean?
[14:44:50] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:44:56] <duch_kazatel> yeah you need to override it.
[14:44:57] <duch_kazatel> brb
[15:03:46] <Vivekananda> hey everyone
[15:03:47] <Vivekananda> I am still at a loss to understand why the bootstrap collapse or the jquery toggle is working so slow  but css:hover works so fast. Also I am trying to locate a pure css way , hack or not , got get a click event
[15:04:22] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Vivekananda
[15:04:22] <b-ot> Vivekananda: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:05:37] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: I already have the code working on the site but I havent prepared an example. my code works great on using css:hover  to hide/show div but is very slow using jquery or bootstrap toggle
[15:06:35] <duch_kazatel> small examples help break the problem down to only the relevant bits.
[15:06:42] <duch_kazatel> so we can focus.
[15:06:50] <Vivekananda> currently I am trying to use this example and work from here http://jsfiddle.net/TYhnb/
[15:07:00] <Vivekananda> ie a pure css hide/show approach
[15:07:21] <duch_kazatel> define "slow" for jquery.
[15:07:43] <duch_kazatel> just trying to understand what you're doing.
[15:07:58] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: much better than that I can show it to you actually
[15:08:03] <Vivekananda> gimme a couple of mins
[15:08:17] <duch_kazatel> and if you want css, go to #css.
[15:08:26] <duch_kazatel> but something tells me you're doing something very strange.
[15:10:27] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: could very possibly be that so that is why it is better to show I guess.  so right now I am doing this on a branch on git. should I merge it into the master and then push up to show on the site ? or  should I just push the branch up ?
[15:10:40] <duch_kazatel> woah what
[15:11:18] <duch_kazatel> slow your roll - is this a personal project or what?
[15:11:25] <duch_kazatel> and can you give me an isolated example?
[15:11:27] <Crucials|2> that escalated quickly
[15:11:30] <duch_kazatel> because if not, I can't really help.
[15:11:36] <duch_kazatel> since i'm at my job and stuff.
[15:11:38] <duch_kazatel> Crucials|2 ++
[15:12:18] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: it is a simple example yes but I believe I showed you the site itself a while back
[15:12:27] <Vivekananda> still working on the same site/thing
[15:12:38] <duch_kazatel> dunno i do so much stuff it's hard to remember who/what
[15:12:49] <Vivekananda> no worries.
[15:52:09] <Guest54868> Hi
[15:52:42] <duch_kazatel> why do people change their name to the guest one?
[15:53:27] <Guest54868> Fail to indentify their name in time
[15:53:34] <duch_kazatel> aaaah
[15:53:43] <duch_kazatel> weird.  i just have that scripted.

[15:54:34] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[15:55:04] <Guest54868> The last option get in the dropdown gets selected..
[15:55:11] <Guest54868> can't figure out why
[15:55:38] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Guest54868
[15:55:39] <b-ot> Guest54868: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:56:31] <Guest54868> Ok and that is :P?
[15:56:49] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:56:58] <duch_kazatel> you need to share your code
[15:57:15] <duch_kazatel> there's no way i can help you without seeing what you're doing.
[15:58:18] <__joshua___> oh duch_kazatel:  im sure we could make educated guesses.    Did you add <option value="last" selected="selected">Last</option>?
[15:58:39] <eip56> Lol yea guest we cant help you without code
[15:59:19] <duch_kazatel> __joshua___ i'd really rather not offer conjecture when they're being that vague.
[15:59:31] <__joshua___> $("select option:last").attr("selected","selected");
[15:59:41] <__joshua___> heh, im just being facetious
[15:59:41] <duch_kazatel> should use .prop() instead btw ;)
[16:00:11] <__joshua___> good point
[16:02:22] <Guest54868> ok ill post my code there
[16:02:24] <Guest54868> 1 sec

[16:39:42] <motaka2> 	how can I answer this question? Please explain how you would retrieve this data if it was instead accessed over a RESTful service on a third party domain. What sort of problems would you encounter and which methods would you employ to solve them
[16:40:41] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 by answering it?  is this for a job or school or something?
[16:41:17] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: For a job, I think the answer is jsonp, But I am not sure
[16:41:38] <duch_kazatel> that has nothing to do with REST
[16:44:10] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: So, would that take a long time to me to learn the answer to that question ?
[16:44:48] <duch_kazatel> i don't know - judging by your assumption, yes.
[16:44:56] <duch_kazatel> but i don't know what your skillset it.
[16:45:19] <duch_kazatel> *is
[17:13:48] <bowenac> is this not correct $(this).find(".wpb-bm").data('post_id', thisid);
[17:14:27] <duch_kazatel> assuming .wpb-bm is one of $(this)'s children,
[17:14:29] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[17:14:56] <bowenac> I'm trying to update a data-post_id value before updating I am using idTarget = $(this).find(".wpb-bm").data('post_id'); as a test and then alert(idTarget); which is alerting the correct value
[17:15:15] <bowenac> then I am using $(this).find(".wpb-bm").data('post_id', thisid); after the alert but it never updates the value
[17:15:32] <duch_kazatel> where are you looking for the value?
[17:15:36] <bowenac> alerting this id shows the correct value I want to update with as well
[17:16:09] <duch_kazatel> are you console.log()'ing after the update?
[17:16:23] <yannickoo_> hey guys, can you tell me how to access date? http://jsfiddle.net/wHeWx/
[17:16:23] <bowenac> no just viewing in firebug
[17:16:34] <duch_kazatel> bowenac the HTML won't update.
[17:16:59] <duch_kazatel> yannickoo_ really?  foo.date;
[17:17:11] <bowenac> so this isnt possible?
[17:17:20] <duch_kazatel> bowenac huh?
[17:17:29] <bowenac> console.log says nothing to output
[17:17:36] <duch_kazatel> show me your code then.
[17:17:49] <duch_kazatel> and it's console.log(yourValueHere)
[17:18:03] <duch_kazatel> yannickoo_ but your object isn't valid.
[17:18:04] <yannickoo_> duch_kazatel: but why this.date is not possible?
[17:18:05] <bowenac> http://pastebin.com/wr5Zvv2t
[17:18:26] <duch_kazatel> bowenac ^^ instead of alert(value), use console.log(value)
[17:18:57] <duch_kazatel> yannickoo_ huh?
[17:19:47] <duch_kazatel> yannickoo_ it sounds like you need to read a simple tutorial.  you seem confused.
[17:20:04] <bowenac> ok so that is logging the correct value... but it won't update the actual html value?
[17:20:09] <yannickoo_> duch_kazatel: TypeError: Cannot read property 'getHours' of undefined because this does not exist at this time
[17:20:36] <duch_kazatel> bowenac nope - that'd be slow.  .data() caches things elsewhere and reads/sets on that.
[17:20:53] <duch_kazatel> yannickoo_ you need to go read a tutorial/.
[17:21:48] <bowenac> dang this isn't going to work then... trying to change a bookmark wp plugin which is currently just grabbing the page post id for the bookmark button etc
[17:22:17] <duch_kazatel> bowenac huh?  are you using .data() everywhere?
[17:22:23] <bowenac> so was trying to change that so each post would be using the correct post id, then each bookmark button would have the correct bookmark id
[17:22:30] <bowenac> no
[17:22:37] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:23:08] <bowenac> I was trying to use this script right after the php output that creates the bookmark shortcode output
[17:23:24] <bowenac> to set the correct data-post_id
[17:23:38] <duch_kazatel> still not making sense - why can't you use .data() to read/write values?
[17:24:01] <bowenac> I don't know why can't I?
[17:24:12] <bowenac> that is what I was trying to do I thought you said thats not possible...
[17:24:19] <duch_kazatel> .data() works fine for that.
[17:24:50] <duch_kazatel> on pageload, jquery caches all your data attributes and reads/writes from the cache.
[17:25:08] <bowenac> doesn't seem to be working because when I click the bookmark button, I am alerting the id and its the page id as the data-post_id value isn't changed it seems
[17:25:31] <bowenac> well they must be using a different approach in this plugin
[17:25:35] <duch_kazatel> are you reading data('post_id');
[17:25:39] <duch_kazatel> brb
[17:25:47] <Cryptoclearance> can I get a little help?
[17:25:48] <Cryptoclearance> http://jsfiddle.net/7vZnH/3/
[17:26:01] <Cryptoclearance> Why isn't mine working like the jsfiddle example ? http://dogeornodoge.com/test.php
[17:26:08] <duch_kazatel> back
[17:26:14] <duch_kazatel> bowenac can you jsfiddle it?
[17:26:47] <bowenac> maybe not it is working... had to update the other file lol
[17:27:20] <Cryptoclearance> duch_kazatel Hey! Could you take a quick look at my issue?
[17:27:23] <duch_kazatel> Cryptoclearance you can't bind to something that doesn't exist yet - wrap that in a doc ready.
[17:27:49] <Cryptoclearance> <-- Kind of a jquery noob
[17:27:51] <Cryptoclearance> Do what?
[17:28:00] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery document ready
[17:28:01] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .ready() | jQuery API Documentation ‚Üí http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[17:28:06] <duch_kazatel> read that
[17:28:39] <Cryptoclearance> You mean wrap it in a dom?
[17:28:49] <duch_kazatel> that is a document read.
[17:28:50] <duch_kazatel> *ready
[17:29:05] <duch_kazatel> that is not "a dom"
[17:29:16] <duch_kazatel> the DOM is an API - it's how your JS interacts with the page.
[17:29:30] <Cryptoclearance> I really don't see where my code is wrong.
[17:29:36] <Cryptoclearance> I have everything the jsfiddle has
[17:29:46] <duch_kazatel> the jsfiddle is running the js AFTER the html exists.
[17:29:47] <__joshua___> no, the jsfiddle is waiting til onready
[17:29:48] <duch_kazatel> yours is not.
[17:29:57] <duch_kazatel> your code is trying to bind before the HTML exists.
[17:30:18] <duch_kazatel> so put $(function() { before and }); after
[17:30:20] <duch_kazatel> done.
[17:30:34] <Cryptoclearance> Where does that go?
[17:30:40] <duch_kazatel> your javascript
[17:30:58] <__joshua___> or $( document ).ready(function() {   /* my code */ });
[17:31:23] <duch_kazatel> which is the same thing.  http://jsfiddle.net/c5Pzt/
[17:31:24] <Cryptoclearance> I'm lost :/
[17:31:26] <duch_kazatel> it'll look like this.
[17:31:37] <duch_kazatel> learn.jquery.com - go here and have fun.
[17:31:53] <Cryptoclearance> IT WORKS!
[17:31:56] <Cryptoclearance> You guys are amazing.
[17:32:04] <duch_kazatel> now try to learn why.
[17:32:09] <Cryptoclearance> I will.

[17:32:19] <axscode> hi guys in jquery, if i have <a href="">BLANK HREF</a> <-- how can i remove <a tag></a> if href="" is blank
[17:32:36] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i go.
[17:34:33] <antlong> Hi, I'm looking to see if anyone would be interested in helping out with a jquery based game. www.multiverseminer.com It's a community developed game (about 15 people), and we could use a hand with implementing a couple of features. Excellent specs and docs, great time. #multiverseminer if you're interested.
[17:38:51] * __joshua___ thought to himself, pffft, why would you use jquery for a game. but it actually looks pretty neat so far.
[17:40:44] <antlong> __joshua___ thank you :)
[17:40:52] <antlong> __joshua___ it's been a week, we're making a lot of progress
[17:41:13] <__joshua___> how are you doing the collaboration?
[17:41:25] <antlong> private git repo, communication via github tracker, and in our IRC room
[17:41:28] <Guest38772> Hello, Im having problem with ajax and classes. Somebody care to help?
[17:41:48] <BillCriswell> I have no idea what's goin on in the game, but it seems like a good start.
[17:43:00] <antlong> thanks a lot :)
[17:43:12] <antlong> basically, mine, get resources, you can build your ship and travel to other planets
[17:43:36] <antlong> theres a lot of recipes, things to make. eventually you'll need to build the ship before you can explore space. theres also combat in progress.
[17:44:36] <BillCriswell> Nice. Never got into this sort of thing but I'm sure it'll end up fun for others.
[17:44:40] <__joshua___> Guestxxxxx: don't ask to ask, just go for it
[17:44:56] <antlong> we could use help :) there's over 15 of us now hacking away. Here's our docs, if you're interested in helping out, let me know. We'll have rev share soon enough if we all pitch in to code it up. http://goo.gl/5lC9Yc
[17:45:12] <antlong> there's also a bounty board, i pay out of pocket for certain pieces to be completed.
[17:52:09] <BillCriswell> antlong: Nice.
[17:53:32] <antlong> BillCriswell thanks
[17:56:04] <BillCriswell> I should build an online jeopardy game haha.
[17:56:46] <BillCriswell> I just hate that answers would have to be super specific to be right.
[18:12:36] <davidsharer> hey anyone here use selectize.js?
[18:16:09] <BillCriswell> davidsharer: I have not, using a similar plugin though.
[18:17:39] <davidsharer> BillCriswell: I'm using it along side of jquery's datatables.net as a plugin for the crud editor module. It is sweet, except the fact that I can't figure out to how to initialize the html element..
[18:18:20] <davidsharer> there is a basic syntax where you set the value to some string, but it's slightly more complicated if you want to to attach an id or other meta data associated with the text.
[18:18:53] <davidsharer> just curious, what plugin are you using?
[18:19:16] <BillCriswell> I've used Chosen.
[18:19:51] <BillCriswell> What's your issue though, you can't initialize the plugin?
[18:20:55] <davidsharer> when it renders it's a blank text box.. Others have posted this same issue.. their API doc says to set html attr val="['Selection1','Selection2']"
[18:21:36] <davidsharer> and that will work, but if you want to store an id as an attribute alonside of that selection there is no API supporting that.
[18:22:04] <davidsharer> However if you populate the options via ajax and select the option, it will populate the text box and set all of that automatically
[18:23:10] <davidsharer> there are a few open issues on github.. but I am determined to find a work around
[18:30:37] <BillCriswell> davidsharer: I think I'd need to see an example to follow a little better.
[19:28:39] <il> Jquery Datatables's ColReorder is returning "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'left' of undefined " when I initialize it with "sDom": 'R<"top">rt<"bottom"lp><"clear">i'. Why?
[19:32:04] <il> hello?
[20:27:29] <imjakechapman> hey everyone
[20:28:01] <jphase> hi
[20:28:17] <imjakechapman> question... I'm trying to loop through a list of strings and call a .init() on each one.. but it comes back as undefined.
[20:28:47] <jphase> imjakechapman: a list of strings probably wouldn't have a .init() method unless you prototyped it
[20:29:30] <imjakechapman> http://laravel.io/bin/konOe#
[20:29:45] <imjakechapman> I have App.main.init(); which works
[20:30:17] <imjakechapman> hmmm
[20:30:32] <imjakechapman> not sure how to call the init method on the appropriate module.
[20:30:58] <jphase> imjakechapman: are you trying to pass a selector into the init function by chance? like $('.someelements').init(); ?
[20:31:27] <imjakechapman> jphase, no I have data-module="somename" on html elements
[20:31:37] <imjakechapman> I'm looping through an array of possible module names
[20:31:44] <jphase> well App.main.init() != App.init()
[20:32:15] <imjakechapman> jphase, I know it doesnt... but within the App.init() is the loading of the modules.
[20:32:16] <jphase> App.init() is the function that loops through each data-module element, and also, try not to use wildcard * in your selector there
[20:32:46] <jphase> oic, the App.init() at the bottom, didn't see that
[20:32:57] <imjakechapman> jphase, yea that kicks everything off
[20:33:05] <jphase> and is the function firing or no?
[20:33:19] <imjakechapman> no it comes back as... Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[20:33:19] <jphase> i.e. "load name" is in your console?
[20:33:28] <imjakechapman> load main shows up yes.
[20:33:52] <imjakechapman> but once i do... name.init(); I get the undefined is not a function error
[20:34:04] <imjakechapman> then if I do App.name.init(); that doesnt work either
[20:34:17] <imjakechapman> how can I interpolate the name into a call like that?
[20:34:45] <jphase> well in this particular example, I don't really see the purpose of App.main.init(); so you could always just call App.init(); from App.main.init(); but you should probably console.log(App.init()); to see if you get a function back
[20:35:39] <imjakechapman> ahh.. got it... :)
[20:35:44] <imjakechapman> dot notation won't work with that
[20:35:50] <imjakechapman> you can use the App[name].init(); and it works
[20:36:40] <jphase> that would pass in a DOM object into that function, sure, but you shouldn't need to do that with what you're doing there
[20:37:04] <jphase> it's not even taking a selector and .each'ing through it, just .each'ing through 'main'
[20:37:25] <imjakechapman> yup
[20:37:35] <jphase> honestly it looks okay to me at first glance, I'd have to console.log stuff to help further :[
[20:37:43] <jphase> aka, you're not too far off :)
[20:37:54] <imjakechapman> ok, friend just got here for dinner
[20:37:55] <imjakechapman> gotta run
[20:37:59] <imjakechapman> thanks for the help. :)
[20:38:00] <imjakechapman> i
[20:38:03] <jphase> np
[20:38:32] <imjakechapman> http://youtu.be/WgPePk3kGZk?t=8s
[20:40:40] <jphase> lol, dramatic
[20:48:21] <Vivekananda> in case duch is here I was doing something wron
[20:48:31] <Vivekananda> I guess you mentioned it too jphas e
[20:49:41] <Vivekananda> the show/hide would work nearly similarly but for the show I had like 200 ul 's attached to a div and what I was doing was to show them each in turn . Now I included the whole thing in a big div and am showing that div and that is working much faster
[20:51:07] <jphase> Vivekananda: that's exactly what I suspected
[20:51:10] <jphase> that's why it lagged
[20:51:26] <jphase> have a container element, and hide/show that instead of looping through each element
[20:51:49] <jphase> subsequently, you can then probably use .slideToggle or some other jQuery animation function without the lag btw
[20:54:52] <Vivekananda> jphase: why did you not tell me this ?
[20:55:03] <Vivekananda> It took me like 5 hours to figure it out!
[20:55:19] <Vivekananda> :)
[20:55:42] <jphase> Vivekananda: I actually did suggest that the reason for your lag was "multiple elements in your selector" as opposed to "one containing element" - it might have gotten lost in helping other folks :\
[20:56:02] <Vivekananda> and the problem is that I was using your code itself!   you had given the .siblings thing and I used it verbatim and behold ... lol
[20:56:15] <Vivekananda> but no worries
[20:56:27] <Vivekananda> finding something out by oneself is bittersweet !
[20:56:32] <jphase> ahh that makes sense
[20:56:51] <jphase> true dat, often times 5 hours for something simple is the sweetest lesson one can learn :)
[20:57:42] <Vivekananda> also now I dont have to use the onclick() !!  I had previously resigned to the fact that jquery is the culprit and so I have to use onclick to make it faster
[20:58:03] <Vivekananda> but I believe I can use jscript now
[20:58:24] <Vivekananda> but first I need to commit the present thing and then will make the changes and finally merge it
[20:58:34] <jphase> and as much as I hate the term "rule of thumb" (since it literally stems from being able to beat your wife with anything as wide as your thumb or less) - generally speaking, speeding up your jQuery DOM functions (i.e. anything that manipulates the DOM) is almost ALWAYS about selecting less elements, using a more specific selector, or iterating through less elements in general
[20:58:41] <Vivekananda> then create a fresh branch for creating more functionality
[20:59:13] <jphase> not always, but usually
[20:59:49] <Vivekananda> yes I am beginning to understand this but matters were not helped when I read that jquery  is kind of lame ( :) ) in the way that if you give a .class  some click function it will first iterate throught the entire doc before doing the .class thing
[20:59:58] <Vivekananda> now that is definately a time taker!
[21:00:15] <Vivekananda> usually ?
[21:02:03] <jphase> yeah, in general most routines get quicker when iterating through less things
[21:02:10] <fizzle> how do I go about running a php script and fetching the output from the php and using it with jquery/javascript
[21:02:12] <jphase> especially when it comes to the ODM
[21:02:36] <fizzle> i had someone direct me towards json. but I haven't the clue where to start
[21:02:56] <jphase> fizzle: AJAX functions should do it. in PHP you can grab data and do something like, die(json_encode($data)); and then use jQuery to grab it either with .post or .get or .ajax for example
[21:04:09] <Vivekananda> fizzle: lol
[21:04:10] <jphase> fizzle: generally speaking:     if($_POST) {  //do stuff...     die(json_encode($data)); }       then you can use like...   $.post('path/to/my/phpscript.php', { postdata: 'something' }, function(response) {  alert(response);  });
[21:04:16] <Vivekananda> a very big question
[21:04:21] <Vivekananda> break it down in parts
[21:04:34] <jphase> fizzle: inside response you can do like..... response = $.parseJSON(response);    and then it parses the JSON object
[21:05:21] <Vivekananda> jphase: dude ( sorry if you are a gal but I am guessing not) . You should all of that went inside him and not above him ( assuming he just started learning howto ? )
[21:05:29] <Vivekananda> sure*
[21:06:08] <jphase> I prefer to be thorough and used to get upset when I couldn't find a working example while learning something new :)
[21:06:09] <fizzle> hmm sounds complicated :P. I'm trying to use queries to get some mysql database stuff, then output it into HTML format, then i need to grab the HTML elements and have them dynamically displayed on the desired page
[21:07:00] <jphase> fizzle: sure, so in your php script, grab the SQL data and do something like.... if($_POST) { die(json_encode($data)); }       where $data = your SQL data
[21:07:34] <fizzle> Ok. so in my function which grabs the data I just add that line and it will route it through to json?
[21:07:39] <Vivekananda> fizzle: lemme try and give you a overview pic of what jphase just told you and of course he can correct me. So first you do a client side php  or ajax query which wil just be a function code and will  request   'data' from a 'url'
[21:07:48] <jphase> fizzle: then in jQuery, do something like....  $.post('path/to/your/phpscript.php', { foo: bar }, function(response) { console.log($.parseJSON(response)); });
[21:08:17] <jphase> here, I can give you an example actually, let me spin something up on my server....
[21:08:20] <Vivekananda> then on the specified url you go ahead and write php code to get data out of database, sanitize it and parse it  and then 'echo' or return it in some way
[21:08:35] <fizzle> jphase, thank you so much
[21:08:36] <Vivekananda> after these two steps your client  can then use the data to display
[21:09:41] <fizzle> Vivekananda, I understand the process.  Use the php code to grab the mysql data... return it with the json_encode() function... then use jquery to get the data from the json?
[21:10:33] <Vivekananda> perfect . I just explained coz i was having trouble knowting that when I was learning this :). but yes so now you need what jphase already told you ie the steps of doing each
[21:10:44] <fizzle> ok
[21:10:45] <Vivekananda> ie json return code , error handling
[21:10:47] <jphase> sorta hard to grasp at first, it's all good
[21:11:37] <fizzle> http://xniz-solutions.comuf.com/#
[21:11:56] <fizzle> if you click on the gallery link. that is what I need to load dynamically. the gallery section
[21:12:08] <fizzle> all the thumbnails/image locations will be stored in the database
[21:14:38] <fizzle> im surprised theres not a tutorial online showing how to do this :P. i found some pages but im not sure if its what I am lookin for
[21:15:35] <fizzle> ahh I think i see now
[21:17:47] <acidjazz> supsup
[21:18:00] <acidjazz> if i do a $(window).on('scroll', function);
[21:18:15] <acidjazz> and then i run that again
[21:18:18] <acidjazz> do i need to .off first
[21:18:22] <acidjazz> to clean up
[21:20:47] <jphase> fizzle: sorry for the lag:   http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/2Fd46/
[21:21:14] <jphase> fizzle: the php script is ghetto and simple, but it's this:   http://hastebin.com/ukaxitaxul.php
[21:21:29] <fizzle> jphase, thank you :D
[21:21:31] <jphase> you'd obviously replace the data you "die" with, with the SQL result inside json_encode()
[21:21:37] <jphase> np
[21:21:58] <jphase> acidjazz: what do you mean "run that again"?
[21:22:10] <jphase> that should execute whenever you scroll
[21:22:53] <acidjazz> jphase: im writing a parallax function
[21:22:56] <acidjazz> and as you scroll
[21:23:02] <acidjazz> i want to turn on and off parallax movement
[21:23:20] <acidjazz> and so i was thikning about binding and unbinding to scroll based on if i needd to move things as you scrolledf
[21:23:46] <acidjazz> i dont want it moving objects that are not on the viewport
[21:23:59] <fizzle> jphase,  I will look into it more later. its a bit late. so I am going to work on the design aspect for now. thanks a bunch
[21:24:08] <fizzle> hopefully that will help get me started
[21:24:08] <acidjazz> then again i can just try and see if its in the viewport...
[21:24:15] <acidjazz> yea i think ill do that
[21:24:44] <acidjazz> i wonder if browsers do taht as well
[21:25:08] <fizzle> I think im going to buy a laptop and a galaxy tablet when i finish this job.
[21:25:36] <fizzle> I am also coding an admin panel in php for my client to update his website on his own. :P makes it easier for me. I won't have to constantly update the website
[21:25:53] <fizzle> but I am fairly new to jquery so I am having to take it step by step
[21:27:10] <fizzle> But.. I am hoping to make $500 off of this website once it is complete... hopefully... heh
[21:27:37] <jphase> fizzle: sounds pretty cheap ;)
[21:27:46] <jphase> insanely cheap actually
[21:27:47] <fizzle> jphase, thats what I was thinking...
[21:27:55] <fizzle> its a full mobile responsive website
[21:28:05] <jphase> I don't get out of bed for < $2k
[21:28:22] <fizzle> maybe when Im finished, I will post the links and maybe you guys can help me calculate a reasonable price
[21:28:36] <fizzle> I am new to this.. so Im not sure of the wages
[21:28:49] <fizzle> however, my client is my boss, and he has money.. hell he spends $1400 a month on advertising alone
[21:28:57] <fizzle> actually.. $2400/m
[21:29:01] <beancurd> fizzle: wow... $500 is really cheap.
[21:29:05] <beancurd> fizzle: is this usd?
[21:29:08] <fizzle> yes
[21:29:26] <beancurd> is it too late to renegotiate?
[21:29:48] <fizzle> nope. I hadn't had any prices set
[21:29:52] <fizzle> he just said, I'll pay you good.
[21:29:54] <fizzle> :P
[21:30:05] <beancurd> $500 for the whole lot is a fair bit. you're better off doing things in chunks, it'll take the burden off you as well.
[21:30:12] <beancurd> so.. $500 for single landing page,
[21:30:15] <jphase> I'd perhaps populate a wordpress template for a dear friend with <= 3 pages for $500, otherwise that's a total robbery situation
[21:30:23] <fizzle> ic
[21:30:25] <beancurd> another $x for contact form.
[21:30:31] <beancurd> then anethr $x to add x.
[21:30:35] <beancurd> and then go from there.
[21:30:47] <fizzle> i see..
[21:30:48] <jphase> that's a decent base calculation ^
[21:30:55] <jphase> depends on if it's a custom contact form
[21:31:14] <beancurd> but wait fuck.. did you say you're doing a php admin backend as well?
[21:31:19] <fizzle> yes
[21:31:24] <fizzle> that I am
[21:31:30] <beancurd> you're undervaluing either your services or your time.
[21:31:35] <beancurd> probably both.
[21:31:41] <fizzle> so he can modify his gallery, events, and revies
[21:31:42] <jphase> but, even if you're a total nub and not used to coding, I'd suggest starting with visually stimulating themes on a CMS like WordPress and charging at LEAST $800 - and that'd be for 3-4 pages or less
[21:31:44] <fizzle> reviews*
[21:32:00] <fizzle> nah I am good with code. :P
[21:32:03] <jphase> the ONLY exception would be a close friend that you want to do their site for cheap to build your portfolio
[21:32:05] <fizzle> just having to learn new stuff thats all
[21:32:25] <fizzle> jphase, that is kinda the thing. I am putting this in my portfolio. and the client is my boss
[21:32:30] <jphase> well honestly, 75% of folks these days are not looking for custom projects unless they need something advanced like an OOP SaaS app
[21:32:34] <beancurd> fizzle: as good as anyone is, it still takes time to get things off the ground.
[21:32:41] <fizzle> beancurd, exactly.
[21:32:48] <beancurd> jphase: by folks you mean clients right.
[21:32:55] <jphase> indeed
[21:32:58] <jphase> beancurd: ^
[21:33:13] <jphase> the reason being that they want the option to go elsewhere with developers
[21:33:18] <beancurd> right, because as a dev, i would love to churn out custom code all day long.
[21:33:18] <fizzle> I am coding... a review module for users to submit reviews into database, admin panel to update gallery/control of the reviews/ and post events.
[21:33:20] <jphase> so they want some platform that's commonly used
[21:33:23] <beancurd> _all_ day long.
[21:33:25] <beancurd> :D
[21:33:27] <jphase> indeed
[21:33:37] <fizzle> and obviously the responsive design
[21:33:55] <jphase> which, similarly to flash (not quite as bad), makes the developer the only person that can work on your project typically
[21:33:59] <jphase> even with a custom CMS
[21:34:04] <fizzle> and... this.. http://xniz-solutions.comuf.com/ is where I am at now
[21:34:10] <beancurd> my last custom job involved a webscraper + node.js crap. it was fantastic.
[21:34:42] <jphase> beancurd: I'm doing a few of those right now :)
[21:34:51] <jphase> fizzle: not a bad start, props for using font awesome :P
[21:34:52] <fizzle> I was hoping to make at least $500 once the website is complete... but if you guys say I could get more.. than I may try to squeeze $800
[21:35:00] <fizzle> fontawsome is pretty sleak
[21:35:15] <jphase> I use foundation CSS and font awesome in most of my projects
[21:35:16] <beancurd> fizzle: don't quote flat rate for whole job if it's as big as what you've described.
[21:35:27] <fizzle> beancurd, well I hadn't quoted anything to him yet
[21:35:27] <jphase> listen to beancurd ^
[21:35:32] <jphase> unless you have a scope document
[21:35:34] <fizzle> i just told him, we would work it out
[21:35:37] <jphase> i.e. formal legal proposal
[21:35:41] <jphase> even if it's your boss
[21:35:46] <jphase> actually...... especially if it's your boss
[21:35:54] <beancurd> fizzle: formally propose a project plan and approximate schedule.
[21:36:09] <fizzle> beancurd, the schedule is the problem
[21:36:19] <fizzle> its been a few weeks, but I only get an hour or two throughout the day to fiddle with it
[21:36:24] <beancurd> if you have a good relationship with the dude, introduce him to agile dev.
[21:36:31] <jphase> fizzle: even if you don't have a deliverables schedule, you can still just itemize "what you get" for "$_____"
[21:36:48] <beancurd> this kind of thing is ripe for an agile approach.
[21:36:52] <fizzle> jphase, yes I was thinking quoting based on quality and functionality.
[21:37:17] <jphase> also, put in a clause for "up to 20% overage" and "anything not defined in this scope document will require a change order and separate bid"
[21:37:17] <fizzle> like i said.. this is my first "live" project
[21:37:27] <beancurd> so brave.
[21:37:31] <jphase> that's why we're trying to help with what you should give him
[21:37:39] <fizzle> yes thank yo
[21:37:41] * beancurd salutes.
[21:37:47] <fizzle> i dont want to sell myself short you know
[21:37:48] <jphase> even if it's a low bid, define what he/she gets for it
[21:37:52] <beancurd> jphase: what are you doing with your scrapers?
[21:38:57] <jphase> beancurd: atm, I'm using node.js with restify and cheerio to take POST data (URL, search term, parent selector, return selector, pagination selector) and return JSON of any website that matches a regex term and recursively paginates through the result.
[21:39:21] <jphase> i.e. "search craigslist on ______ URL for 'developer' and click the 'next page' link until there are no more pages and poop out JSON"
[21:39:27] <fizzle> I'm hoping to make enough money to invest in a budget laptop ($180-$220 used), and maybe a galaxy tablet or ipad, and a 3G internet box so I can design on the go
[21:39:45] <fizzle> and pay my hosting for a month or two which is only $40
[21:39:46] <beancurd> jphase: ah, using phantom js?
[21:39:58] <jphase> not yet anyhow, pretty infant stages
[21:40:03] <fizzle> so in total... approx $600-700 is all I really need to get my design hardware in order
[21:40:06] <jphase> I actually have another implementation with sails.js and redis
[21:40:48] <beancurd> interesting..
[21:40:56] <jphase> beancurd: https://github.com/jphase/botscrape <--- sails/redis implementation
[21:41:25] <beancurd> nice.
[21:41:27] <fizzle> I got trolled hard last night when I asked if anyone knew of budget tablets to use for viewing mobile websites that I create... pfft.
[21:41:30] <jphase> I decided it was a bit too much overhead and I'll start out with no db layer
[21:41:58] <beancurd> fizzle: nexus 7's can be had for not much $
[21:42:06] <jphase> fizzle: browserstack.com :)
[21:42:08] <beancurd> or make do with chrome / ff emulation. heh.
[21:42:13] <jphase> or---- chrome developer tools
[21:42:19] <fizzle> the question was... "Im looking for budget tablets", so the guy refers me to a $400 iPad... I'm like wtf.. then I'm lookin galaxy tablets for $120 that could easily be used for viewing
[21:42:21] <jphase> most people don't realize there's an emulator built in
[21:43:01] <fizzle> so the guy says.. "if you dont like the advice, then fuck off"
[21:43:03] <fizzle> how rude.
[21:43:06] <fizzle> fkin scratchpost
[21:43:15] <beancurd> haha.
[21:43:19] <beancurd> in ##design+
[21:43:22] <beancurd> ?
[21:43:29] <fizzle> yea. i even said "thank you anyways" then he tells me to fuck off
[21:43:32] <beancurd> haha.
[21:43:36] <fizzle> like wtf.. i dont understand people
[21:43:38] <beancurd> welcome to ##design
[21:44:01] <jphase> fizzle: http://snag.gy/onQZg.jpg
[21:44:01] <fizzle> I had met him a few days earlier, spoke with him and complimented his work, and then i get a fuck off
[21:44:02] <fizzle> lol
[21:44:08] <jphase> yay for chrome emulation!!
[21:44:22] <fizzle> oo interesting
[21:44:28] <beancurd> i think he's a top bloke irl.
[21:44:32] <beancurd> probably.
[21:45:00] <jphase> fizzle: open up dev tools and hit "ESC" and click the Emulation tab
[21:45:09] <fizzle> inside of chrome?
[21:45:11] <jphase> at least until you get a native device
[21:45:11] <jphase> yeah
[21:45:18] <fizzle> ok. i use FF. let me install
[21:45:40] <fizzle> see... if that is the view on the galaxy tablet.. then the mobile navigation didn't show up as I hoped
[21:46:03] <fizzle> if you open it and resize it in the browser, you will see the responsive menu
[21:46:18] <fizzle> but... my queries are out of whack
[21:46:20] <jphase> most tablets these days render at 1020x768 or more, so they render the desktop version
[21:46:25] <fizzle> oooh ok
[21:46:31] <jphase> especially ones that use retina
[21:47:41] <jphase> fizzle: your design skills are worth > $500 btw, you seriously need to value yourself higher
[21:47:51] <jphase> most people don't use recent concepts
[21:48:19] <fizzle> oo
[21:48:25] <fizzle> well thank you.. for the compliment.. i guess :P
[21:48:53] <fizzle> I have a portfolio site I am working on as well.. that is going to be amazing :P
[21:49:04] <fizzle> its not live right now.. but its freakin sleak
[21:49:12] <Uhkis> pics!
[21:49:24] <fizzle> hehehe nope :D. its a surprise
[21:49:38] <fizzle> my portfolio thumbnail module is freakin sleak
[21:49:39] <jphase> I'm still not much of a designer, my latest attempt is http://closettheory.com
[21:50:00] <beancurd> fizzle: work firewall blocked your site :/
[21:50:02] <beancurd> http://xniz-solutions.comuf.com/
[21:50:05] <fizzle> awww :(
[21:50:11] <fizzle> jphase, that looks good though man
[21:50:18] <jphase> meh, mostly cool because 100% of the site is content manageable and idiot-proof
[21:50:22] <fizzle> def a good start
[21:50:27] <jphase> that was a $6,000 bid to give you an idea of worth
[21:50:29] <jphase> and that's low btw
[21:50:38] <Uhkis> i like that clean design :-)
[21:50:38] <fizzle> $6000 u made for that?
[21:50:49] <Uhkis> too bad it doesn't work at all without javascript
[21:50:53] <jphase> yeah, includes blog templates and will have an ecommerce component too though
[21:51:03] <fizzle> ooo... thats freaking sweet
[21:51:08] <jphase> meh... if you're on the web without JS, then get off the web imo :)
[21:51:24] <fizzle> jphase, but how do you go about finding clients that will pay that?
[21:51:42] <Uhkis> jphase: lets gather our forces and kill noscript addon!
[21:52:07] <jphase> fizzle: that was actually a referral, a friend of a friend and she knows how much I normally charge for stuff that's custom
[21:52:12] <fizzle> ooh ok.
[21:52:19] <fizzle> jphase,  i like the idea of having all of your content on one page
[21:52:24] <fizzle> thats the same route I am going with
[21:52:33] <jphase> granted, that's a custom wordpress theme, so 60% of it was about custom admin components that allows her to paste in content and have it work seamlessly
[21:52:35] <acidjazz> fizle you simmer down there
[21:52:46] <acidjazz> i had a question and you scrolled it way up
[21:52:49] <acidjazz> w/ your typery
[21:53:01] <fizzle> oh... I am sorry
[21:54:00] <fizzle> Yes. i tend to.. talk too much :/... I apologize again
[21:54:05] <jphase> acidjazz: I though you answered your own question?
[21:54:11] <jphase> at least it seemed that way
[21:54:17] <jphase> s/though/thought
[21:55:44] <Uhkis> fizzle: i'm pretty sure we don't have any rules against talking in here :-)
[21:56:04] <fizzle> well its just interesting talking to people who make real money doing free lance work
[21:56:31] <fizzle> I have alot of disabilitys and I am trying to get into free lance web development as a main source of income
[21:56:55] <Uhkis> where are you from?
[21:57:02] <fizzle> I live in America. North Carolina
[21:57:26] <Uhkis> afaik freelancing there can be the only/main source of income
[21:57:32] <jphase> I <3 NC - got tons of friends in Asheville
[21:57:34] <Uhkis> unlike here in finland
[21:57:43] * jphase = Fort Lauderdale, FL
[21:58:02] <fizzle> afaik?
[21:58:06] <jphase> Uhkis: I hear your country is beautiful! :)
[21:58:07] <fizzle> omg
[21:58:09] <fizzle> jphase
[21:58:14] <fizzle> i went to school there...
[21:58:18] <fizzle> Nova Southeastern University
[21:58:21] <fizzle> freaking amazing
[21:58:22] <jphase> nice
[21:58:25] <Uhkis> jphase: well, in the winter (if there is one)
[21:58:29] <Uhkis> jphase: now it's just too hot
[21:58:29] <fizzle> the city that never sleeps
[21:58:31] <fizzle> :D
[21:58:36] <jphase> you happen to know of a restaurant named "Zambra" ?
[21:58:48] <fizzle> naa i spent alot of time at the beach
[21:58:56] <fizzle> and at mansion parties lol
[21:59:03] <jphase> oic, a buddy of mine runs that joint
[21:59:35] <jphase> Uhkis: my hometown is Portland, Oregon... we rarely have snowy/bonafied winters either
[22:00:14] <jphase> fizzle: if you know folks that own mansions, you need to charge > $500 for a website that's responsive :P
[22:00:28] <fizzle> hehehe. those were just fraternity guys I hung out with.
[22:00:31] <fizzle> I am back home in NC now :P
[22:00:37] <jphase> oh nice!
[22:00:45] <jphase> how old are you if you don't mind me asking?
[22:01:00] <fizzle> I am 23. I started scripting/programming and using HTML 4 when I was 12
[22:01:08] <jphase> oh you've got plenty of time then
[22:01:11] <fizzle> experimented alot with different languages. :P
[22:01:15] <Uhkis> jphase: well we always get some snow/winter, but sometimes it's only like 2 weeks (like this winter)
[22:01:36] <fizzle> jphase, well all of the local businesses within 50 miles have absolutely GARBAGE websites.
[22:01:43] <fizzle> so I am going to try and recruit local clients
[22:01:43] <Uhkis> i really prefer -25¬∞C to this +25¬∞C
[22:01:45] <jphase> fizzle: same, I started in lower level software engineering (C++, perl, pascal, cobol, etc.) and went to the web after
[22:02:13] <fizzle> I started with mIRC scripting, then HTML/CSS, then a little bit of C++, some perl and php, and assembly
[22:02:19] <jphase> fizzle: sounds like you need to finish up your portfolio site and do some business card dropping
[22:02:29] <jphase> hah! I used to ROCK TCL mIRC scripts!
[22:02:30] <fizzle> jphase, that is my goal after i finish my first client website
[22:02:37] <Uhkis> i made my first website in -96 (as 10 year old)
[22:02:40] <fizzle> jphase,  :DDD mIRC was freakin sweet back in the day
[22:02:42] <jphase> made a ton of really evil mIRC themes
[22:02:51] <fizzle> jphase,  you ever use ms.org?
[22:02:51] <jphase> now I'm 100% linux/mac
[22:02:58] <jphase> yeah
[22:03:07] <fizzle> yessir. linux ftw. i use windows for gaming and web design
[22:03:15] <fizzle> well my name was red-line back on ms.org
[22:03:22] <fizzle> i posted a few projects nothing serious
[22:03:37] <fizzle> i still have mirc code on my backup server from 2003
[22:03:39] <fizzle> hehehe
[22:03:43] <jphase> I made one of the first mIRC scripts that used DCC to create a botnet and flood folks off mIRC
[22:04:05] <jphase> granted, that was back when you could just send packets to modems to make them hang up
[22:04:18] <fizzle> lmao
[22:04:26] <Uhkis> using your super powers for evil :O
[22:04:27] <fizzle> yeeep. i remember. 56k connection hehe
[22:04:36] <fizzle> i was 12 then
[22:04:41] <fizzle> internet addict
[22:05:00] <Uhkis> you were on 56k in 2003?
[22:05:11] <fizzle> yeeep
[22:05:16] <fizzle> didnt get to dsl until 2005
[22:05:39] <fizzle> i ran trial versions of aol every month lol. parents couldnt afford to pay for internet so I had to fraud aol :/
[22:05:58] <fizzle> but I spent most of my teenage years online, coding, and learning about operating systems
[22:06:16] <fizzle> shit, i was in 6th grade, my gwam was 166. my teachers was only 80 haha
[22:06:21] <jphase> dude... I was one of the original developers that wrote some of the TOS and punt tools - I used to hang out in #gol  (gods online) under the alias cookie
[22:06:34] <fizzle> oo i remember those :D
[22:06:39] <jphase> that was when I was an evil little VB programmer.... that's embarrassing now
[22:06:48] <fizzle> lol. :D
[22:07:07] <jphase> HOSS and porn* and Smerk and all those cats were my buddies in crime
[22:07:37] <fizzle> i hung out in coldfusions.net for a while. then i was in surrealchat/mediadriven
[22:07:49] <fizzle> you remember dynamicz.org?
[22:07:52] <fizzle> or coderscore?
[22:08:00] <jphase> I actually still know many of those kids, porn* is my good friend from highschool - he's currently at wikimedia foundation
[22:08:03] <fizzle> i was actually close to the creater of coders core
[22:08:07] <jphase> some other folks went blackhat security after that
[22:08:17] <jphase> I honestly don't remember fizzle
[22:08:21] <jphase> was a LONG time ago
[22:08:32] <fizzle> hehehe. indeed
[22:08:35] <fizzle> almost 10 years
[22:08:43] <jphase> >
[22:09:02] <jphase> I was 14 when I started hanging out in there and I'm 30 now
[22:09:03] <jphase> brb
[22:09:10] <fizzle> yowzers lol
[22:10:50] <fizzle> oo having problems viewing on my android thats odd
[22:35:02] <fizzle> ooo what a night :P
[22:41:37] <jphase> :)
[22:42:15] <fizzle> jphase you have a portfolio?
[22:42:44] <jphase> not atm unfortunately, starting out with a web dev blog and building my portfolio after
[22:42:49] <fizzle> awsome
[22:43:00] <jphase> my company's portfolio is kinda ghetto so I decided to branch off
[22:43:09] <fizzle> oo. link or is it private?
[22:43:20] <jphase> to my blog or the company portfolio?
[22:43:29] <fizzle> the company
[22:43:49] <jphase> http://webdesigncompanyportland.com/ - this is actually the new one I did for them
[22:43:57] <jphase> their site is http://offthewallmedia.com
[22:44:37] <fizzle> ya i see what you mean
[22:44:43] <fizzle> why not switch to yours?
[22:44:43] <jphase> mhm
[22:44:52] <jphase> well it's a different company entirely
[22:45:02] <fizzle> ooh ok
[22:45:11] <jphase> and mine isn't quite ready yet, just a dev blog:  http://robido.com/blog
[22:45:14] <fizzle> the one you did was much better than the other
[22:45:28] <jphase> well yeah hehe, but still not there
[22:45:34] <fizzle> yeah i agree
[22:45:37] <fizzle> you did robido?
[22:45:49] <jphase> that's my blog, yeah
[22:45:54] <jphase> my company = robido
[22:45:58] <fizzle> ooh ok. thats cool stuff
[22:46:14] <jphase> basically nerd stuff atm, eventually I'll launch a portfolio on robido.com
[22:46:26] <fizzle> right right
[22:46:30] <fizzle> well you're doin good then :D
[22:46:37] <jphase> thx :)
[22:46:47] <fizzle> i really need a laptop to dev on for this web stuff
[22:47:11] <fizzle> that is my goal of this first job for my boss. laptop and a tablet . I want to get into web design on a serious note
[22:47:20] <fizzle> and the responsive stuff is actually quitef un
[22:47:24] <fizzle> quite fun*
[22:47:38] <jphase> yay for media queries!
[22:47:39] <fizzle> it helps me to be more open about things.. gives me new inspiration
[22:48:40] <fizzle> once the site is done, ill def link you to it and you can give me some pointers or whatever ( if you'd like to) and help me with a reasonable price :)
[22:49:02] <jphase> sure thing, I can send you over some of my proposal and hosting agreement documents if you'd like
[22:49:08] <jphase> took a long time to write those
[22:49:18] <fizzle> yeah cool stuff. I wouldnt mind takin a read
[22:49:36] <fizzle> and.. I'm a nice guy... unlike scratchfuck
[22:49:48] <jphase> pm me your email
[22:49:51] <fizzle> i may ask some stupid questions sometimes.. but gotta learn somehow :P
[22:50:12] <jphase> no such thing as a stupid question
[22:50:38] <fizzle> true again. as long as its a question and theres an answer :D
[22:51:06] <fizzle> I am looking to do this on a serious level though. I'm quite nifty with alot of different things. my problem is unity and content
[22:52:21] <jphase> that doc is a little off on margins, but you get the idea
[22:52:29] <fizzle> indeed
[22:53:03] <fizzle> weird.. my site looks like crap on the default android browser.. i dont think it supports transitions ugh
[22:53:08] <fizzle> had to install firefox beta on my android
[22:54:06] <TuomasL>  perhaps throw browser feature support detection in there
[22:54:08] <fizzle> Im having a weird problem with my slide image... i have it centered using jquery, but when i view it on my phone... the image can slide left and right if you touch it
[22:54:24] <fizzle> TuomasL, yes. I will have to check it out
[22:54:42] <fizzle> I had a piece of code in there for that but I may have removed it. Ill fix it up later
[22:55:04] <fizzle> anyways.. i gotta find out why this image is sliding left and right hm
[22:55:23] <fizzle> i disabled the scrolling on the div but still scrolls horizontally
[22:55:28] <TuomasL> it's a bit hefty but I added modernizr to a recent site, as not having transition support kind of ruined the site :D
[22:55:44] <fizzle> yeah i had modernzir there too
[22:55:52] <fizzle> my site is based on transitions so :/
[22:56:10] <TuomasL> indeed
[22:56:22] <TuomasL> what do you mean when you touch it, it moves? randomly?
[22:57:10] <jphase> you mean the menu? works on my android browsers
[22:59:25] <fizzle> no like...
[22:59:33] <fizzle> http://xniz-solutions.comuf.com/
[22:59:37] <fizzle> if you open it on an android phone
[22:59:54] <fizzle> the "hero" image slides left and right if you swipe it
[22:59:59] <fizzle> not good.. it needs to be fixed
[23:00:15] <fizzle> I am using jquery/js to centered the image based  on the browser width
[23:00:19] <TuomasL> that is one giant png
[23:00:39] <fizzle> yes i need to trim it a bit
[23:00:45] <fizzle> jpg?
[23:00:47] <TuomasL> yes
[23:00:59] <TuomasL> ~75% quality should pack it tons but still retain quality
[23:01:00] <fizzle> ok will do. but anyways.. do you see what I mean?
[23:01:04] <fizzle> alright
[23:02:12] <TuomasL> fine on my phone, then again it's chrome for Android
[23:02:36] <fizzle> im on firefox for android
[23:02:50] <fizzle> so when you touch the top image.. it doesnt move left or right if you swipe it?
[23:02:51] <jphase> doesn't slide on android default browser and chrome for android
[23:02:58] <jphase> not for me
[23:03:01] <fizzle> thats odd
[23:03:41] <TuomasL> although why are you using jquery to center it
[23:04:12] <fizzle> well... hard to explain really..
[23:04:19] <fizzle> basically.. when it goes into the "mobile queries"
[23:04:25] <fizzle> I have the hero image set to a fixed width
[23:04:29] <fizzle> instead of 100%
[23:04:37] <fizzle> if I set it to 100% the image gets super small
[23:04:47] <fizzle> so I used a constant width value and then centered it on the page with jquery
[23:04:51] <jphase> hmm, still looks 100% to me, the top image?
[23:05:00] <fizzle> yes. it looks 100%, but its not.
[23:05:04] <fizzle> its 1000px, centered
[23:05:24] <jphase> that sounds like a hack, you should just figure out why the container doesn't allow 100%
[23:05:31] <fizzle> it allows 100%
[23:05:33] <fizzle> but wait
[23:05:38] <fizzle> ill show you. one moment
[23:05:40] <TuomasL> of course but then the height is tiny
[23:05:58] <TuomasL> if you browse on say 480px wide phone
[23:06:32] <jphase> could just center it and do overflow hidden then
[23:06:51] <jphase> meh, depends on what you want to show
[23:06:55] <TuomasL> indeed
[23:07:27] <fizzle> http://xniz-solutions.comuf.com/#
[23:07:29] <fizzle> refresh it now
[23:07:43] <fizzle> the image is 100% but you can hardly see it
[23:07:55] <fizzle> which is why i set the width to a fixed width.. 1200px actually. and it made it zoomed in a bit
[23:08:00] <TuomasL> Another option is setting the image a background, giving it a set height at resolution below X, and just having positioning as center top
[23:08:25] <fizzle> TuomasL, that sounds good
[23:08:47] <fizzle> but yes, at 100% on the phone, the height is small now. and it looks.. retarded i guess lol
[23:09:05] <fizzle> if u resize the browser to the smallest width, you will see what I mean
[23:09:21] <fizzle> now.. let me add the other part back in and you will see the difference
[23:09:52] <fizzle> ok now refresh it.
[23:09:53] <jphase> fizzle: set the background of the container to the image and do center center positioning and background-size: cover;
[23:10:04] <fizzle> ok
[23:10:07] <fizzle> one moment
[23:10:59] <jphase> bbl
[23:11:04] <fizzle> cya
[23:11:38] <fizzle> ahh ya i forgot.. idk why, but the background-image isnt working forme
[23:12:01] <fizzle> idk why.. but ive tried a few times today and cannot get background images to load
[23:12:44] <TuomasL> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9995729/irc/jquery/background.PNG
[23:13:19] <fizzle> ok
[23:13:19] <TuomasL> just for examples sake the inline css
[23:13:24] <fizzle> ok
[23:16:25] <fizzle> pfft not loading the image
[23:16:29] <TuomasL> plus with a div and a background image, it leaves an option to easily have text or other elements included
[23:16:34] <fizzle> http://xniz-solutions.comuf.com/#
[23:16:34] <TuomasL> in slides
[23:16:53] <fizzle> idk why but the background images havent been showing.. i dont get it
[23:17:22] <TuomasL> add
[23:17:42] <TuomasL> url as ../images/slide1.png
[23:17:51] <TuomasL> it's relative to the css file location, not the site
[23:18:07] <TuomasL> so you have to traverse back one folder in the background url
[23:18:11] <fizzle> oh
[23:18:12] <fizzle> yeah
[23:18:13] <fizzle> crap
[23:18:17] <fizzle> lol i forgot sorry
[23:18:20] <TuomasL> :)
[23:18:38] <TuomasL> I so like those mobile menus
[23:19:21] <fizzle> fixed.. thank you
[23:19:48] <fizzle> hmm having problems scrolling now heh
[23:19:59] <fizzle> brb
[23:20:46] <TuomasL> problem scrolling?
[23:22:12] <fizzle> yea.. sometimes it wont let me scroll down the page pfft
[23:22:43] <fizzle> works fine on my pc.. lemme reupload the main files
[23:23:21] <fizzle> ok fixed
[23:23:27] <fizzle> somethin was off in one of my css files :P
[23:24:03] <fizzle> now the last problem I have ... when I am on my android phone.. when i pop out the navigation menu. it automatically selects home
[23:24:31] <fizzle> so .. if im on the events page and i open the navbar, it takes me directly back home without even tapping the link
[23:24:51] <fizzle> weird really
[23:26:32] <TuomasL> not for me
[23:26:42] <fizzle> my phone is garbage lol
[23:26:43] <fizzle> pfft
[23:27:00] <TuomasL> it is however a bit offputting that home has the active/hover state immediately on open
[23:27:09] <fizzle> thats what i mean
[23:27:18] <fizzle> sometimes it activates the link
[23:27:21] <TuomasL> oh
[23:28:05] <fizzle> idk.. maybe ill reload the original jquery files for the plugin
[23:28:07] <fizzle> might fix it
