[00:00:38] <ert> I see "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 's3Slider' "
[00:01:21] <Benqb> s3 slider is for some another
[00:01:27] <Benqb> i will remove nw that

[00:18:38] <Benqb> hi
[00:19:32] <Benqb> nw its no error in console
[00:22:29] <sbarcteam> hi, I am selecting a table body in a loop.
[00:22:35] <sbarcteam> At some point I am adding sub-tables.
[00:22:48] <sbarcteam> The selector I'm using is "#tblid tbody"
[00:23:04] <sbarcteam> As a result ALL subtables' tbodies are selected as "bad" (not well)
[00:23:18] <Cork> sbarcteam: store the selection before the loop and use the variable
[00:23:29] <xec> sbarcteam: usually, selecting inside a loop is a sign of bad structured code
[00:23:36] <xec> what Cork said.
[00:24:08] <Cork> var tbody = $('#tblid tbody'); /* loop */ tbody.do-you-jquery-command /* loop end */
[00:24:14] <sbarcteam> OK, I must defend myself: I'm trying to create table (with some internal tables) by displaying js object.
[00:24:18] <sbarcteam> But I got your feedback.
[00:24:45] <Cork> sbarcteam: theres never a reason to run the selector multiple times in a loop
[00:25:03] <sbarcteam> I see...
[00:27:39] <sbarcteam> I did the var thing, thanks.

[01:21:30] <e-anima> anyone here familiar with "thejit"? i would have some questions about Rgraph concerning the JSON data structure
[02:09:50] <Sebah> yo! I've made this script which is changing the TOP position of an element based on the offset.top. The problem I'm having is that whilst scrolling on the page the element keeps jumping ( flickering ). I tried using animate but same thing happened. Does anyone know how can I ease the 'transition' a bit, or do I have to rewrite the script and use position fixed?
[02:20:02] <Cork> Sebah: the scroll even isn't called while the page is scrolling
[02:20:17] <Cork> Sebah: so there isn't really a way to make it stick while scrolling
[02:20:31] <Cork> all you can do is make it slide back when the scrolling ends
[02:20:37] <Cork> or ya use fixed
[02:20:50] <Cork> that doesn't fix mobiles though
[02:22:55] <Sebah> Cork: I was thinking that positioning it fixed might be my only solution, but then I'll have to rewrite that bit of a script ( it's a dynamical parallax, oh God! ). I might just leave it with top coordinates for mobiles and fixed for desktop :)
[02:23:03] <Sebah> Cork: thanks for your help!
[02:31:36] <Lost123> http://tinyurl.com/d3qavht source can be seen and line 150 function not works
[02:34:00] <Cork> Lost123: your not waiting for the dom to be ready
[02:34:26] <Cork> so your selector on line 149 never matches anything
[02:35:04] <Lost123> so it shouldn't be .click/
[02:35:14] <Lost123> it should be run on dom ready?
[02:35:30] <Cork> ?.ready
[02:35:31] <bot-t> .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[02:35:36] <Cork> it should be wrapped in that
[02:36:23] <Cork> Lost123: right now your script runs when ca half the head tag has been parsed
[02:36:35] <Cork> there isn't any content at all in the body yet
[02:37:19] <Lost123> $(document)(function(){$(".ws_images img").click(function(){     if ($(this).css("display")=="block") window.location=$(this).attr("data-href");   }); });
[02:37:26] <Lost123> this is what it should be?
[02:37:34] <Cork> no
[02:37:49] <Cork> $(function(){$(".ws_images img").click(function(){ ...
[02:37:54] <Cork> or $(document).ready(function(){$(".ws_images img").click(function(){ ...
[02:38:25] <gorh> hi there
[02:39:07] <Lost123> $(document).ready(function(){$(".ws_images img").click(function(){     if ($(this).css("display")=="block") window.location=$(this).attr("data-href");   }); });
[02:41:31] <Lost123> Cork: can you check now the source
[02:41:43] <Lost123> http://tinyurl.com/d3qavht
[02:42:32] <Cork> your page crashes in chrome.js line 179
[02:43:21] <Cork> Lost123: and your comment block include invalid characters
[02:43:29] <Cork> (line 226)
[02:44:23] <Cork> actually your code include loads of invalid xhtml code
[02:44:30] <Cork> so you should prob just change the doctype instead
[02:45:05] <Lost123> no i have got the problem i think
[02:45:16] <Lost123> the images are covered by a div
[02:45:33] <Lost123> absolutely positioned div, so clicking images actually we click that div
[02:45:36] <Cork> Lost123: yes, what i mean is that page won't ever be able to be parsed as xhtml (and its parsed as broken html now)
[02:45:41] <gorh> silly question : is there a good resource to get .ajax() to work in ie ? i to have to use cross domain policy, but i can't realy understand how it work
[02:45:56] <gorh> *i seem*
[02:45:57] <Cork> Lost123: so just change the doctype to html5 => <!doctype html>
[02:46:10] <Cork> its not xhtml so don't call it that
[02:46:35] <Cork> gorh: you can't do cross domain ajax in ie
[02:46:52] <Cork> gorh: and well its about 30% of the web users
[02:47:00] <gorh> ? really ?
[02:47:03] <bot-t> gorh, Tutorials:Really Simple Live Comment Preview - jQuery JavaScript ... - Adding a live preview to the comment entry area of Wordpress. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Really_Simple_Live_Comment_Preview
[02:47:47] <Cork> gorh: yes ie uses XDomainRequest
[02:47:58] <Cork> and it doesn't support www-form encoding
[02:48:13] <icebox> gorh: workaround: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/quick-tip-cross-domain-ajax-request-with-yql-and-jquery/
[02:48:16] <gorh> ok, so i need to have 2 system running, or work with json, as i feared
[02:48:19] <Cork> gorh:  so you can't post to ex. $_POST or $_GET in php (and the like in other languages)
[02:48:32] <Cork> gorh: you should prob proxy your ajax calls instead
[02:48:50] <Cork> at least until ie dies (joke)
[02:49:03] <gorh> grumph !!! or until i hanfg myself
[02:49:24] <Cork> cross domain ajax calls with data in them won't work until at least after ie10 is gone from the market
[02:49:30] <gorh> (i'm new to a project where 2 year of dev have been made without thinking of ie, and … i have to fix it :)
[02:50:02] <Cork> well ie sucks, and sadly too few users care
[02:50:18] <icebox> gorh: a live example: http://albertosantini.github.com/examples/mataf/matafSignals_jquery.html
[02:50:38] <gorh> yep, and … 1/3 of our used base is on … ie6 for historical reasons )
[02:50:46] <gorh> thanks ice
[02:50:49] <gorh> i'll dig into this
[02:51:42] <Cork> ouch
[02:51:53] <Cork> gorh: then you can't even use css2 :/
[02:51:56] <Cork> that SUCKS
[02:52:12] <icebox> gorh: you are welcome... of course, it is only a workaround and it is limited... I second Cork's suggestion to use a proxy
[02:52:56] <gorh> ok, i think i'll simply hang myself then )
[02:53:05] <gorh> this is the easyer solution :)
[02:53:52] <Cork> gorh: katering for ie6 is almost impossible
[02:54:18] <Cork> gorh: only way to handle that is to just give them a super plan (img and html no css) page with out js
[02:54:27] <Cork> ^ie6 that is
[02:54:53] <gorh> tbh for now i got almost everything to work, at least a decent way
[02:55:00] <Cork> trying to make things work in ie6 and at the same time not killing your self in compatibility hacks, thats the only way
[02:55:10] <gorh> this ajax thing is my last bit to solve, but the bigger one
[02:55:39] <Cork> gorh: you could user a function and use a proxy solution only for ie browsers
[02:56:00] <gorh> by prxying you mean, make a php that fecth the data on my server then send it ?
[02:56:09] <Cork> thats one solution
[02:56:35] <Cork> or something like nginx to make a real http proxy
[02:56:52] <Cork> that makes all calls to a sub folder on your current domain forward to the target domain
[02:57:17] <Cork> something like my-domain.com/other-site > nginx > other-site.com/url
[02:57:58] <nerique> Hi everyone
[02:58:06] <gorh> whaa this is a real pain, anyway i look at it
[02:58:14] <Cork> ya it is
[02:58:27] <Cork> but hey, its ie we'r talking about
[02:58:32] <Cork> its always a pait
[02:58:34] <nerique> can anyone help with an issue with sortable?
[02:58:34] <Cork> *pain
[02:58:45] <gorh> i may fetch via php, since i know how to do it, and this nginx seem rather complicated
[02:58:45] <Cork> should prob add that as a synonym in the dictionary
[02:59:04] <gorh> pain : synonym : develop for IE
[02:59:05] <gorh> :)
[02:59:34] <Cork> i though more of IE: synonym see pain
[02:59:55] <nerique> I use a sortable with nested categories. 3 levels of nest. Categories, sub-categories, items. An item can be drop in any sub-category in the tree, a sub-category in any category in the tree, and the categories can be sort.
[03:00:02] <nerique> on oload, everything is collapsed
[03:00:17] <nerique> on expansion, the lists are not connected anymore
[03:00:24] <nerique> I can sort items within the same sub-category
[03:00:37] <nerique> but am unable to send an item to another subcategory
[03:00:52] <nerique> Any idea what It can be related?
[03:00:56] <gorh> thanks anyway i'll look into that, later
[03:00:59] <nerique> Any idea what It can be related to?
[03:01:13] <bokgroll> how do I JSONize a js array?
[03:01:53] <Cork> JSON.stringify(arr)

[03:17:05] <Jork1> how I can select an element 3 parents up? $(this).parent().parent().parent() looks bad
[03:17:53] <gorh> @zamba can't you just use alert ? i don't see why jquery would be needed
[03:18:39] <zamba> gorh: maybe i can
[03:18:45] <zamba> gorh: but i'm still not able to do so :)

[03:19:35] * norbi waves to everyone
[03:20:36] <nerique> Hello, anyone to help on this? I use a sortable with nested categories. 3 levels of nest. Categories, sub-categories, items. An item can be drop in any sub-category in the tree, a sub-category in any category in the tree, and the categories can be sort. on oload, everything is collapsed on expansion, the lists are not connected anymore I can sort items within the same sub-category but am unable to send an item to another subcategory 
[03:21:02] <norbi> $element=$("<div><p><span>here is my text</span></p></div>"); $element.children("span").text("changed text!"); should work?
[03:21:53] <KolakCC> norbi, don't name your own variables with $
[03:23:22] <dabear_> KolakCC: really
[03:23:23] <norbi> KolakCC: ok, but it should?
[03:23:36] <dabear_> norbi: continue naming jquery variables with $
[03:23:45] <dabear_> if that pleases you :)
[03:23:56] <dabear_> some even call that best practice
[03:24:08] <KolakCC> dabear_, really?
[03:24:31] <dabear_> norbi: if you use find instead of children, it will work
[03:24:51] <dabear_> .children only gets the immediate children, while .find searches grandchildren etc as well
[03:24:58] <KolakCC> :O never heard of that one before. /ignore kolakcc
[03:25:53] <norbi> dabear_: ah you are right, i forgot about that, i wondered why it doesn't work, thanks!
[03:31:20] <FengWong> hey there is there a way how I can local save a text file with jquery ?
[03:31:23] <dogmatic69> What is the best way to build plugins for jquery? There are a lot of tutorials and most of them are completely different :(
[03:33:44] <gorh> FengWong : yes and no, you will run into trouble creating the file itself
[03:34:00] <gorh> you need to write it client side, or server side ?
[03:34:29] <FengWong> sadly client side :(
[03:35:54] <gorh> i would rather make a server side solution, then send it to the client, browsers acces to system file is hard to manage
[03:36:53] <bullicon> any tip on how to use .on for dynamically created dom nodes ?
[03:37:23] <bullicon>  $('#selector').on("click", function(e){ …… not working
[03:37:23] <bullicon>    
[03:39:13] <dogmatic69> bullicon: $('.foo').live('click', function()... ?
[03:39:38] <FengWong> I'm currently working on a cross-platform mobile app and there is no way to make this server side :(
[03:39:42] <cusco> hi
[03:39:48] <FengWong> @gorh
[03:39:50] <cusco> Im looking to style a text input
[03:39:56] <cusco> but can't find it in jquery ui
[03:39:59] <bullicon> dogmatic69: works thanks
[03:40:07] <bullicon> thought live was deprecated
[03:40:27] <dogmatic69> bullicon: oh, could be
[03:40:39] <bullicon> well the new one, .on was not working
[03:40:42] <bullicon> live works anyways
[03:40:45] <bullicon> F it :)
[03:42:08] <gorh> so feng i'm not sure of how you can handle it then
[03:42:50] <dogmatic69> bullicon: the docs have $(document).on("click", "a.offsite", function(){ alert("Goodbye!"); });
[03:43:10] <dogmatic69> you have $("a.offsite").on("click", function(){ alert("Goodbye!"); });
[03:48:07] <FengWong> just found it that there is a way with html5 to local save informations as long as I want... so anyway thank you =)
[03:56:01] <greek> Hi, in jquery ui sortable, I am struggling to change the background colour of my placeholder, any tips? I've tried this but it doesn't work: ui.placeholder.css("background-color",  "red"); but this DOES work: ui.placeholder.css("border",  "1px solid red"); What gives
[03:57:40] <tocka> greek show the code on jsfiddle
[04:03:47] <Symbi0nt|GER> bullicon : try that in jsfiddle
[04:04:38] <bullicon> Symbi0nt|GER: the one from dogmatic69  ?
[04:30:11] <jarr0dsz> hi anyone knows how to replace content of div1 with content of div 2?
[04:31:01] <Hornet> I should think most people in the channel know that
[04:31:16] <b-ot> jarr0dsz, http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[04:31:28] <jarr0dsz> yes i tried its not working it does not explain how to load a div contents in
[04:31:40] <jarr0dsz>   $('#start').load('#start_hidden');
[04:31:44] <jarr0dsz> but does nothing
[04:33:38] <dabear_> ?load @ jarr0dsz
[04:33:54] <dabear_> jarr0dsz: can I ask, why did you try .load?
[04:34:04] <dabear_> did you read the docs at all?
[04:34:12] <dabear_> load does something completely different
[04:34:12] <jarr0dsz> replaceWith dident work
[04:34:25] <dabear_> so you randomly try functions
[04:34:26] <dabear_> great
[04:35:19] <jarr0dsz> not at all ive tried  $('#start').replaceWith('#start_hidden');
[04:35:48] <jarr0dsz> i know replace is the way to go but in the docs nowhere is stated how to load the contents of a div instead
[04:38:03] <jarr0dsz> well its $('#div2').html($('#div1').html());
[04:38:14] <jarr0dsz> jquery is just a frustrating language you always have to combine several functions ugh
[04:42:08] <nlogax> Much like lego is a terrible toy, all those pieces that you can put together into bigger, more awesome things
[04:42:50] <dabear_> jarr0dsz: jquery is a framework
[04:42:56] <dabear_> javascript is a language
[04:43:09] <anli_> Is it possible to set font in a ckeditor?
[04:43:25] <Cork> yes
[04:43:31] <anli_> I was trying to add some style information while editing the source directly
[04:43:40] <anli_> Maybe a font tag :)
[04:43:52] <anli_> How do I do that?
[04:43:57] <Cork> it even has a special param that you can give it for what css file to read
[04:44:11] <anli_> Ah, but the user will not know about css files
[04:44:13] <Cork> its basically contentEditable so just inline style should work
[04:44:20] <anli_> I am actually creating a template that the user will use
[04:44:42] <anli_> I was trying to add <style> etc, does not seem to change the result
[04:44:49] <cusco> HI
[04:44:56] <dabear_> hola
[04:44:58] <Cork> anli_: style tags isn't valid inline
[04:45:11] <anli_> But font tags are, although deprecated
[04:45:11] <cusco> in, http://jsfiddle.net/UXdLQ/640/ when someone presses ENTER, the input goes white
[04:45:15] <cusco> what is it triggering?
[04:45:28] <Cork> anli_: like i said inline style
[04:45:45] <Cork> <elm style="font-family: ...;">
[04:46:34] <anli_> yeah...
[04:48:17] <pachet> cusco: not seeing it, what browser are you in?
[04:49:28] <Bartzy> Hi
[04:49:53] <Bartzy> $('#container').on('click', '.class1, .class2', function ....)
[04:50:10] <Bartzy> is it possible to know, in that handler function, what was the selector that was chosen for this event ?
[04:50:14] <Bartzy> if it's class1 or class2?
[04:50:33] <Cork> $(this).hasClass(̈́'class1'=
[04:50:36] <Cork> *$(this).hasClass(̈́'class1')
[04:50:38] <Bartzy> or I have to test e.target if hasClass class1 or class2 ?
[04:50:43] <Bartzy> e.target is this in the handler function ?
[04:50:59] <Cork> this will be the element that matched the selector
[04:51:00] <Bartzy> But jQuery already made this calculation (if it has .class1), I have to do it again ?
[04:51:19] <Cork> it calculates if its matches the selector string
[04:51:27] <Cork> it doesn't know what part of the string it matched
[04:51:32] <Bartzy> Why it doesn't know ?
[04:51:39] <Bartzy> Because it hands it to sizzle and it returns yes or no ?
[04:51:40] <Cork> cause its a css selector
[04:51:56] <Cork> and most of the time sizzle just hands it over to the browser
[04:52:21] <pachet> 90% of the time that's just going to be two .getElementsByClassName calls
[04:52:41] <pachet> join em together and whaddya got, bippity boppity boo
[04:58:14] <Bartzy> jQuery bubbles the event from the event target up to the element where the handler is attached (i.e., innermost to outermost element) and runs the handler for any elements along that path matching the selector.
[04:58:16] <Bartzy> From the docs
[04:59:11] <Chel> question: what is a good datepicker for android browser ?
[05:03:16] <Bartzy> Why jquery checks the entire path , and not only my direct descendant ?
[05:03:46] <pachet> Bartzy: what
[05:04:05] <pachet> are you asking why jquery allows the event to bubble up?
[05:04:12] <Cork> Bartzy: you mean why events bubble?
[05:05:38] <Bartzy> I mean why do I need to check each non-direct child of the 'body' (if that is what I'm attaching to)
[05:05:59] <sunbeam> does anyone know how I can fetch facebook wall posts (public profile/page0 ?
[05:06:11] <Bartzy> I need to check = jQuery need to check
[05:06:21] <sunbeam> I tried using a plugin called fb.wall but it needs some code every 24 hours
[05:06:37] <Cork> Bartzy: cause thats how events work in the dom
[05:06:48] <phschwartz> Hi all, is there a way to create a dropdown field the abbility to take text input and filter based on it? I am converting a dojo project to jquery and would like to maintain the FilteringSelect functionality.
[05:06:48] <Cork> event bubble unless they'r stopped
[05:06:53] <pachet> Bartzy: well, the historical reason is to enable multiple events to fire as the event type bubbles up through the ancestor chain
[05:07:28] <Bartzy> $('body').on('click', '.class1', function...)... - with this DOM: <body><div id="blah"><div class="class1">Yo</div></div></body> -
[05:07:43] <Bartzy> Why check if the div #blah fits the selector .class1 ?
[05:07:56] <Cork> it doesn't
[05:07:58] <Bartzy> Why not only bubble up without checking
[05:08:04] <Bartzy> It does
[05:08:09] <Cork> but each element from the div triggers a click event
[05:08:16] <Cork> and that click event bubbles up through the tree
[05:08:22] <pachet> #blah just doesnt have a click bound :[
[05:08:26] <Bartzy> It doesn't fire the event of course, but it does check if every element in the chain fits the selector
[05:08:39] <Bartzy> Yeah, bubbling up is fine - that's the reason the event gets fired
[05:08:40] <Cork> no
[05:08:47] <Bartzy> from the docs: jQuery bubbles the event from the event target up to the element where the handler is attached (i.e., innermost to outermost element) and runs the handler for any elements along that path matching the selector.
[05:08:49] <Bartzy> Cork ^
[05:09:02] <Cork> what jquery does it check if the target element matches the selector
[05:09:14] <Bartzy> Why do that for every non-direct target element ?
[05:09:23] <Bartzy> Why not only the direct target elment (i.e. the event.target)
[05:10:00] <Cork> to let the event match bubbled events
[05:10:12] <Cork> it can't check the explicit target only
[05:10:22] <Bartzy> Why not ?
[05:10:32] <Bartzy> This is much my question actually - why it can't check the explicit target only ?
[05:10:55] <pachet> that's just not the dom standard model
[05:10:57] <Cork> <body><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></body> $('body').on('click', 'ul', function() {});
[05:11:22] <Cork> thats expected to work, and if you just check the current element, that would fail
[05:11:46] <Bartzy> Right. Can I somehow change that behavior ?
[05:11:54] <pachet> :[
[05:11:59] <Cork> don't use delegated event listners
[05:12:02] <Cork> and write your own
[05:12:10] <Cork> its not like its that many lines to write a plugin for it
[05:12:18] <Bartzy> or will this not achieve what I need , because .class1 can be clicked in directly by clicking something inside that element ?
[05:13:00] <Cork> if you click an element inside .class1 an event listener that checks target wouldn't trigger
[05:13:20] <Bartzy> yeah. got it.
[05:13:28] <Bartzy> So my question is for a very specific use
[05:13:35] <Bartzy> for elements with no children
[05:14:15] <Bartzy> if for example I use .hover or click, and there is 2 elements, div .class1 , and some absolute positioned with z-index div, which is not in the chain of .class1. Both will trigger the event ?
[05:14:20] <Bartzy> there will just be 2 events ?
[05:14:27] <Bartzy> Because the bubbling wouldn't help here
[05:15:32] <Cork> Bartzy:  $.fn.simpleOn = function(event,target, callback) { this.on('event', function(event) { if($(event.target).is(target)) { callback.call(event.target, event); } }) };
[05:15:37] <Cork> or something like that
[05:15:52] <Cork> bah
[05:15:58] <Cork> Bartzy:  $.fn.simpleOn = function(event,target, callback) { this.on(event, function(event) { if($(event.target).is(target)) { callback.call(event.target, event); } }) };
[05:16:28] <silverwind> REALLY?
[05:16:40] <silverwind> hack the planet...
[05:17:32] <Bartzy> Cork: And then I have to know the actual DOM element in target ?
[05:17:50] <Cork> Bartzy: thats the target attribute
[05:18:18] <Cork> and it can be a dom element, a jquery object or a string
[05:22:01] <Bartzy> ok
[05:22:04] <Bartzy> and...
[05:22:07] <Bartzy> if for example I use .hover or click, and there is 2 elements, div .class1 , and some absolute positioned with z-index div, which is not in the chain of .class1. Both will trigger the event ?
[05:22:17] <Bartzy> My last question ^ :)
[05:22:40] <dabear_> Bartzy: no
[05:22:44] <silverwind> It's doesn't matter when the elements are positioned..
[05:22:48] <silverwind> *where
[05:23:03] <Bartzy> So on which element the event will be triggered ?
[05:23:07] <noregret> when append()ing something, the page gets scrolled to the added content, how can i avoid that ? meaning that the scroll stays wherever it is
[05:23:15] <silverwind> Bartzy, the one on top
[05:23:24] <Bartzy> silverwind: So it does matter where they are positioned
[05:23:31] <Bartzy> it's according to position and z-index
[05:23:45] <diverdude> before i can chain methods in my plugin, do i have to do something specific?
[05:23:50] <silverwind> Baranee, It doesn't matter for bubbling.
[05:24:11] <silverwind> Bartzy, ^
[05:25:57] <pachet> diverdude: do you mean, before you can chain methods after your plugin?
[05:26:11] <pachet> diverdude: eg, $('#foo').hide().myPlugin().show()?
[05:26:40] <Bartzy> silverwind: Yes but for this specific example - only the z-index matters right ?
[05:27:04] <diverdude> pachet: yeah i have a plugin with 2 methods a() and b() and i would like to do $('.someclass').a().b()
[05:27:24] <silverwind> Baranee, yes, but the bubbling will be done from the z-index'ed element, the element under it won't be targeted at all
[05:27:25] <pachet> diverdude: just have each method that you expose on $ return 'this'
[05:35:02] <greek> Hi, in jquery ui sortable, I am struggling to change the background colour of my placeholder, any tips? I've tried this but it doesn't work: ui.placeholder.css("background-color",  "red"); but this DOES work: ui.placeholder.css("border",  "1px solid red"); What gives?
[05:36:12] <cusco> hmm
[05:36:23] <cusco> how do I make tue button the same size the input in http://jsfiddle.net/UXdLQ/645/ ?
[05:36:39] <pachet> greek: try .css('background', '#F00') just to rule that out
[05:37:46] <graya> Forgive my idiocy here - how do i access functions inside another function? is that possible?
[05:38:12] <cusco> call the function... ?
[05:38:29] <cusco> your problem description is ambiguous
[05:38:29] <izepstan> hi, hello there, do i have to refresh the DOM after loading some new html with ajax to get the $().click objects working with the new html?
[05:38:52] <izepstan> and how would i do that, if something like that would be necessary
[05:38:54] <izepstan> ?
[05:38:56] <izepstan> thx.
[05:38:58] <pachet> izepstan: you need to either bind to those elements as you add them, or use event delegation
[05:39:10] <izepstan> ok
[05:39:11] <izepstan> thx
[05:41:35] <greek> pachet, nope, nada, but the border colour still changes correctly
[05:42:41] <mprentice> do you guys know of a good, not outdated, book for an introduction to developing apps with jquery?
[05:43:21] <greek> pachet, perhaps the placeholder contains another element that is sitting "above" the background? How else could we explain the fact that the border colour changes, but the background colour doesn't?
[05:43:27] <pachet> cusco: http://jsfiddle.net/8JC2a/
[05:43:46] <zamba> i can't change the data-id of an html?
[05:43:56] <zamba> i tried cell.data('id', -1), but it doesn't take
[05:43:58] <Whirl3d> mprentice, the thing is that by the time you get a book to press on the latest technology, it's out of date.
[05:44:00] <pachet> greek: certainly possible, are you able to post a fiddle?
[05:44:04] <Whirl3d> good morning all
[05:44:09] <pachet> gmorning!
[05:44:15] <cusco> pachet: lol its not the same sze
[05:44:18] <cusco> height
[05:44:41] <cusco> I would only like to add the icon to the input, but that is not possible
[05:44:48] <cusco> so a element next to it..
[05:44:54] <cusco> doesn't need to be a span
[05:45:44] <greek> pachet, there's quite a bit of plumbing code surrounding it, but I guess it's worth the effort to make something. Please give me a few minutes while I prepare it.
[05:46:26] <zamba> how can i find which classes an element has?
[05:46:34] <Whirl3d> I havent'read the entire thread yet, but I really have found that just preparing a limited use case in a fiddle solves so many problems for so many people
[05:46:54] <mprentice> Whirl3d: i was afraid of that
[05:47:07] <graya> cusco: sorry let me try and clarify - e.g. https://gist.github.com/3129207
[05:47:16] <pachet> zamba: $('#foo').attr('class')
[05:47:38] <zamba> pachet: and how can i set those classes on another element?
[05:47:39] <greek> pachet: does including jquery 1.7.2 in jsfiddle automatically include jquery ui?
[05:48:03] <pachet> $('#bar').addClass($('#foo').attr('class'))
[05:48:06] <pachet> zamba^
[05:48:15] <pachet> or just set the attribute if you dont mind replacing the current classes
[05:48:17] <zamba> pachet: don't want to add, i just want to set exactly those classes
[05:48:20] <zamba> ah, yeah
[05:48:22] <zamba> ok
[05:48:59] <Whirl3d> mprentice, the big thing to take away from this, is that a good framework, or system that gets as much acceptance as jquery comes with the notion that future updates will be as backward compatible as possible.
[05:49:02] <zamba> $('#bar').attr('class') = $('#foo').attr('class') ?
[05:49:23] <Whirl3d> So if you learn better by reading a physically printed book. Get the latest one you can find, and read and learn it quickly
[05:49:47] <Whirl3d> then you only have to learn the updates/changes and it won't be that many differences.
[05:50:00] <greek> pachet: please ignore last question, I've gotten it to load jquery ui
[05:50:06] <Whirl3d> the important thing is getting started and understanding the fundamentals, the details will come
[05:50:11] <Whirl3d> ?jquery fundamentals
[05:50:19] <Whirl3d> drats
[05:50:25] <Whirl3d> ? jquery fundamentals
[05:50:51] <graya> is this possible anyone? https://gist.github.com/3129207
[05:50:56] <Whirl3d> bot -t is on vacation or he would have given you a link to ready about jquery fundamentels...google it...LOL
[05:51:02] <zamba> pachet: hm, or maybe not?
[05:51:06] <Whirl3d> mprentice^^
[05:51:18] <pachet> zamba : $('#bar').attr('class', $('#foo').attr('class'))
[05:52:44] <zamba> yeah, got it :)
[05:52:50] <izepstan> pachet, what is the shortest way to do that without use new classes and new functions?
[05:53:21] <Whirl3d> graya, what are you trying to do?
[05:54:32] <pachet> izepstan: just use .on to delegate that event to whatever selector you want within a context, eg
[05:54:55] <pachet> $('#my_container').on('click.mynamespace', '.foo', function ( ) { /* do stuff * / })
[05:55:03] <pachet> where .foo is the class you're targetting
[05:55:58] <graya> Whirl3d: the real situation is with django, there's a formsets jquery plugin which turns a formset into a dynamically modifiable one with the .formset() function. this has a 'sub function' which actually adds the row, and i want to call that from the drop: handler of a droppable
[05:56:30] <greek> pachet: http://jsfiddle.net/EUVrK/
[05:56:53] <Whirl3d> graya, without seeing the plugin and without being sure, I am going to guess that it goes something like this:
[05:57:37] <Whirl3d> the plugin creates a javascript object that stores a reference to iteself int he data object of the form. The plugin object then has several methods that can be accessed to process the form.
[05:58:14] <Whirl3d> Usually in this case, you access the object either by referencing it in the data object of the form or by using the jquery plugin instantiation method, but passing the method you want to access.
[05:58:53] <Whirl3d> For example: var myFormProcess=$("myForm").data("formConroller");   myFormProcess.doSomething();
[05:58:55] <Whirl3d> or
[05:59:20] <Whirl3d> $.("myForm").pluginName("methodName", methodData);
[05:59:24] <pachet> greek: here you are : http://jsfiddle.net/6ECWx/
[05:59:28] <mprentice> Whirl3d: thanks!
[05:59:35] <pachet> greek: just had to remove the visibility:hidden from that element
[06:00:04] <greek> pachet for president
[06:00:06] <greek> pachet++
[06:00:13] <greek> that's been bugging me for hours
[06:00:19] <Whirl3d> mprentice, you'll see that once you get the concept behind jquery, the rest will fall into place--it's logically and semantically pretty consistent.
[06:00:59] <Whirl3d> pachet++
[06:01:57] <ezl> i have an element whose default css is display:none; in some cases i'm trying to make sure it shows on page creation with $().(function(){ .show();}); but i can't seem to make the element display
[06:02:04] <graya> Whirl3d: I think this is just a badly written plugin..........
[06:02:14] <ezl> is that firing before the page loads or something?
[06:02:20] <Whirl3d> do you have online docs for it anywhere?
[06:03:37] <graya> Whirl3d: it's http://code.google.com/p/django-dynamic-formset/
[06:03:38] <Whirl3d> ugggh. there are too many confusing variations of IEFE and docReady shortcuts, that I can never figure out if someone has written one wrong or not
[06:04:13] <silverwind> IIFE?
[06:04:27] <elijahmanor> graya, whirl3d: it doesn't seem to store itself in .data() and the function doesn't appear to be exposed outside the plugin http://code.google.com/p/django-dynamic-formset/source/browse/tags/1.2/src/jquery.formset.js
[06:04:33] <pachet> ezl: do you have an example you can paste on jsfiddle or similar?
[06:04:36] <Whirl3d> ezi, have you tried the ole tried and true classic $(document).ready(function () {  }?
[06:04:40] <elijahmanor> silverwind: immediately invoked function expression
[06:05:01] <Whirl3d> IIFE, not IEFE, lol
[06:05:05] <elijahmanor> silverwind: previously known as a self executing anonymous function
[06:05:10] <Whirl3d> see I can't even get the acronym right
[06:05:25] <silverwind> elijahmanor, I know darling... it was a pseudo-reply to Whirl3d
[06:05:35] <Whirl3d> but it's different than a self-exectuing anonymous function
[06:05:36] <elijahmanor> it is pronounced "Iffy" if you say it out loud ;)
[06:05:38] <elijahmanor> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[06:05:49] <graya> elijahmanor, Whirl3d: i modified it slightly to move the addButton click handler into a function https://gist.github.com/3129273
[06:05:59] <Whirl3d> elijah, it was a typo on my part
[06:06:01] <elijahmanor> whirl3d, it is the same concept just renamed for clarity
[06:06:04] <Whirl3d> he was pointing it out

[06:09:39] <Whirl3d> I had read that it was immediate executing function expression, not immediately invoked function expression.

[06:19:26] <andi> Hello
[06:20:29] <andi> Is there a cool way to save a string while clicking on a checkbox which changes a input[type=text] value. When clicking again the checkbox I'd like to have the old value inside the input[type=text].
[06:21:02] <andi> This should work in nearly every browser. So a solution with $.Storage does not work because IE cannot handle it.
[06:21:32] <pachet> andi: why not just throw the old value in a *gasp* variable
[06:22:46] <andi> pachet: Could you please give me an example?

[06:33:43] <mdeboard> I'm calling `.height( value )` several times to resize a particular DOM element with a vertical scroll bar, but the problem is that it kind of breaks UX because .height causes the scrollable area to I guess be redrawn so it "jumps" back to the top
[06:33:50] <mdeboard> How would I go about addressing this?
[06:35:03] <mdeboard> Using the tinyscrollbar plugin as well
[06:39:32] <PressedWeb> Is there a way to target and remove all &nbsp;
[06:39:45] <pachet> mdeboard: i've never used that plugin, but maybe try storing the scrollHeight and then setting it manually when you change .height() ?
[06:40:01] <mdeboard> pachet: Yeah that's what I'm tinkering with now
[06:40:21] <mdeboard> there's a .tinyscroll_update method you can pass a value
[06:40:26] <PressedWeb> I'm working with aMember, and the newbs put empty spaces everywhere instead of margins/padding on elements, so rather than track them all down, can I just use jQuery to sniff out &nbsp's and remove them?
[06:45:36] <nvictor> hey all
[06:45:53] <nvictor> how do i correctly bind a submit even on ipad?
[06:46:19] <pachet> PressedWeb: that's definitely a poor situation to be in :[  if you're having to parse the whole page it may be quite a performance hit
[06:46:25] <pachet> PressedWeb: nevertheless, http://jsfiddle.net/KeCxH/
[06:49:24] <PressedWeb> pachet: Thanks man, you're a champ
[06:49:33] <PressedWeb> Yeah, aMember is a huge pile of crap
[06:49:49] <PressedWeb> It's markup is really horrible.
[06:58:43] <BoulderDave> I have an element that fades out after 5 seconds (  setTimeout(fadeOutCart,5000);  ).  If I focus on the element, i want the fadeout timer to 'cancel'.  Do I use unbind to do that?
[06:59:10] <BoulderDave> (fadeOutCart just calls .fadeOut() basically)
[07:00:33] <BoulderDave> ahh i see i can use .stop()
[07:00:35] <pachet> BoulderDave: you can probably get away with using .delay(5000).fadeOut(), and then if you focus it, .stop() to stop that queue
[07:01:14] <BoulderDave> pachet, thanks!  looks like a great solution
[07:02:30] <Kneferilis> Hello, I was wondering $.doTimeout(interval,function() {  }); takes care of setTimeout irregularities in browsers?

[07:10:48] <pachet> motmot: can you make a fiddle of your issue, as well?
[07:10:50] <motmot> i just want to know if setTimeout() can be the one glitching ?
[07:11:04] <pachet> i'm not sure what glitching means
[07:12:08] <crashev> hello, any idea how to allow only selected item to be put in input box when using jquery autocomplete ?
[07:12:33] <motmot> glitching in the sense that it wont react quick enough
[07:12:42] <motmot> just for few milliseconds
[07:12:58] <motmot> (i will make a fiddle, just making the code clear)
[07:13:14] <BoulderDave> pachet, it doesn't seem to be 'stopping' the fadeOut() - perhaps because it isn't actually 'in action' (since its still in the delay state) any ideas?  I've set the clearQueue paramter for stop() also.  I'm calling fadeOut() like so: $("#floatingCartContainer").delay(5000).fadeOut();
[07:13:57] <kuldeepdhaka> help: i want to change jquery grid new/edit popup box height and width, using jquery grid name

[07:24:10] <kuldeepdhaka> pachet: ok, but whats a fiddle,?
[07:24:16] <jarco> If a script is in the head of your html and you can read its contents in firebug, but it does not show up in your firebug script to debug, what could be the cause of this?
[07:24:23] <pachet> kuldeepdhaka: jsfiddle.net
[07:24:39] <kuldeepdhaka> pachet: ok
[07:25:46] <pachet> jarco: try disabling and re-enabling firebug
[07:27:15] <jarco> pachet: still no luck. Chrome does see the script (its not executing it but hey, seeing it is a start)
[07:27:22] <kuldeepdhaka> pachet: http://jsfiddle.net/nVWnU/
[07:27:56] <kuldeepdhaka> pachet: this is a generated by php scripts, so a little messy
[07:29:49] <pachet> i was hoping for a minimal test case :[
[07:30:41] <kuldeepdhaka> pachet: i just need the method how to change the popup ( new/edit ) width and height
[07:31:38] <motmot> (thx pachet your fiddle with the timeout just helped me to point something i had wrong)
[07:31:56] <pachet> kuldeepdhaka: well, i can answer that without having to trudge through your code
[07:32:12] <pachet> kuldeepdhaka: it's the 'beforeShowForm' property of the configuration object that you pass into jqgrid
[07:32:12] <jonkersjoe> :)
[07:33:18] <pachet> kuldeepdhaka: so something like : $('#foo').jqgrid({ /* other settings or whatnot */ beforeShowForm : function ( ) { /* modify the dialog div here */ } });
[07:33:40] <pachet> kuldeepdhaka: furthermore, to target that div, use $('#editmod' + some_id)
[07:33:51] <pachet> where some_id is the id attribute of the element you're binding the grid to
[07:33:57] <pachet> in this case, 'foo'
[07:34:23] <pachet> motmot: yw :]
[07:35:09] <pachet> jarco: hrm

[07:40:06] <danzik17> jarco: you're missing the parens to invoke the IIFE.  (function() {}())    NOT (function(){})

[07:44:19] <phschwartz> In a function will prefixing a var with '#' allow access to a DOM id, ie: var id = "#"+name; $(id).change(function(){});
[07:46:01] <pachet> jarco: this is what he meant: http://jsfiddle.net/T5hXF/
[07:46:10] <pachet> see where i pass in (jQuery) explicitly at the bottom
[07:46:42] <jarco> Yes I just changed that also and I noticed now my script is picked up by firebug.
[07:46:58] <jarco> But I don't understand why yet so I guess I need to read that article (a few times)
[07:47:30] <jarco> I do not yet understand what is actually happening
[07:47:53] <pachet> jarco: also note that $(document).ready(function(){   and  $(function(){    do the same thing
[07:48:05] <pachet> so no need to nest the latter in the former, just $(function(){ will do
[07:48:16] <jarco> ohw :)
[07:51:02] <mister_m> hi, I have two tables on a page, and a function that is supposed to add a row to a table one at a time. however, I pass jquery object of a table to this function and then do a (table).find("tbody").append(tr); on it - but that selects the table body of BOTH tables on the page and not just the one I passed to this function. What am I not understanding here
[07:53:18] <pachet> mister_m: can you post your code somewhere?
[07:53:49] <mib_mib> hi guys, i'm using the 'lightness' jquery theme in a seperate css file. I have a div that has a float:left attribute, and its messing up the jquery dialog - why would this be?? the float:left is just attributed to that div
[07:56:02] <mister_m> pachet: yes, give me a moment
[08:03:07] <widoz> hi, how can i get what selector has been called a specific function? i need to use $(this) into the $('a.prettyphoto').prettyPhoto({ 'changepicturecallback' : function(){ //here } }); but $(this) doesn't work
[08:04:04] <pachet> widoz: just save the result of calling $ with that selector into a variable, and use that variable instead
[08:05:07] <pachet> var $prettyphotos = $('a.prettyphoto'); $prettyphotos.prettyPhoto({changepicturecallback:function(){ $prettyphotos.addClass('foo'); } });
[08:05:10] <pachet> widoz^
[08:05:54] <pachet> you can usually suss out the originating element set that the plugin was called upon, but it depends on how the plugin was written
[08:09:05] <ChkDigit> So, what do I do to create a <div>, which is not connected to the main document?
[08:09:24] <ajpiano> $("<div>")
[08:09:42] <ajpiano> var jqObjectOfNewDiv = $("<div>")
[08:09:42] <ChkDigit> aj: Is that not a new div connected to the main document?
[08:09:51] <ajpiano> var foo = document.createElement("div")
[08:09:53] <ajpiano> ChkDigit: yes
[08:10:04] <ChkDigit> I don't want it connected... right away.
[08:10:05] <ajpiano> it's not in the main document until you add it into the document somehwere
[08:10:13] <devmikey> Question: Is there a free jquery or even flat JS API for doing single signon for social networks?
[08:10:45] <ChkDigit> I need to have the new <div> use the id of the existing one.
[08:10:55] <pachet> :[
[08:11:08] <ChkDigit> Then I replace the old with the new.
[08:11:35] <pachet> like a caterpillar becomes a butterfly
[08:12:19] <pachet> why does it need the same id concurrently
[08:12:20] <ChkDigit> True.  So... should I just setAttr() on the new div after I have it replace the old one to set the id?
[08:12:47] <pachet> well, .attr(), but sure
[08:12:51] <fuchstronaut> ChkDigit: that's the easiest way
[08:13:06] <ChkDigit> Sounds good.  I'll do it that way.
[08:13:14] <fuchstronaut> what are you doing with your brand new give?
[08:13:18] <fuchstronaut> give = div
[08:13:52] <ChkDigit> Updating a hierarchy of bill of materials...
[08:16:39] <flayks> hello! do you have an idea to push an element to n object in jquery?
[08:16:40] <flayks> http://pastie.org/private/dfrlh97hvp6k0jzqm5pcq
[08:17:08] <flayks> in my code, i transform an array into an object (the for) and i want to put this new_images object into my options
[08:17:36] <mucker> hi #jquery, how do I replace one element with another ??
[08:17:49] <ajpiano> mucker: see ?replaceWith
[08:17:53] <GoGoGarrett> https://gist.github.com/785682c69489858304de any idea why the e.prevetDefault() isnt working when the form is submitted?
[08:18:03] <ajpiano> flayks: you aren't transforming an array into an object
[08:18:07] <mucker> ajpiano: thnx
[08:18:11] <ajpiano> you are just making another array
[08:18:39] <flayks> ajpiano: in the background option parameter, i set an array
[08:18:57] <flayks> ajpiano: i transform it into an object in the for loop
[08:19:13] <flayks> ajpiano: or something like that huhu
[08:19:29] <ajpiano> flayks: slidesoptions.foo = bar
[08:19:42] <ajpiano> slidesoptions["foo"] = "bar";
[08:19:55] <ajpiano> slidesOptions[ someVariable ] = bar;
[08:20:13] <jenia> hello everyone.
[08:20:18] <ajpiano> the first two will create a key named bar, the second will create a key named with whatever someVariable resolves to

[08:45:08] <ndimatteo> hey all, I have fairly simple question, just looking for some direction: I want to have an input field that lets a user enter a title, when they hit enter/submit it queries a list/database/xml seeing if there is a match, and returns yes/no. What's the best way to go about this, and I'd like to be able to have the address bar change on submit so that user's can share the url to their specific query.
[08:46:04] <ndimatteo> I know ajax is an option paired with PHP, but just want to see if there is a better, more progressive approach to this?
[08:47:41] <manjunath> Can anyone let me know where can I find a good example of $.ajax() with wcf & json.
[08:49:40] <ndimatteo> anyone?
[08:52:24] <Stonekeeper> Hi! I've got an onclick callback on an element and i want to find the element's child 'a' node. I need something like the ancestor selector but when the parent is a jquery object rather than a piece of text. What's the best way to do this? thanks

[08:53:48] <Stonekeeper> oh nm, found it. /facepalm

[08:54:49] <rawroland> $(this).children('img').attr('class', data.ids[index]); but this does
[08:54:50] <rhizmoe> you mean it's something other than a selector?
[08:56:33] <rawroland> rhizmoe: It is a selector.

[10:25:33] <kvnn> I have a use case where I want to detect a drag, but I don't need an element to be draggable or droppable. Would it make sense to use http://jquerypp.com/#drag , and use parameters that void a draggable element?
[10:29:05] <noregret> I have $('#actionBtns').empty().append(d.data).hide().fadeIn('slow') to fadein a string, how can i make this string disappear after a sec or 2 ?
[10:29:34] <pachet> .delay(1000).fadeOut('slow')?
[10:30:25] <noregret> cool, thanks
[10:30:28] <pachet> kvnn: can you elaborate? how would you detect a drag if you have no draggable elements  :[
[10:31:08] <kvnn> pachet: imagine that you want to allow a person to navigate an object 360 degrees horizontally
[10:31:37] <kvnn> they aren't dragging a single element around the container, but they are using their mouse to "drag" left or right
[10:31:52] <kvnn> I've solved it using jquerpp's #drag and the "limit" parameter
[10:32:01] <pachet> oh i see
[10:32:19] <pachet> i would just use 'mousedown' and 'mouseup' personally
[10:35:01] <noregret> pachet: how can I execute something just after the delay time is over ?
[10:35:13] <noregret> is there a callback or something
[10:36:07] <pachet> what delay time do you mean?
[10:37:08] <sorrymyeng> cohitre: thanks, i didnt see "value either equal to a given string or starting with that string followed by a _hyphen_ "
[10:37:20] <sorrymyeng> cohitre: really, thank you so much:)
[10:37:54] <vandunk> I'm using jQuery.noConflict to avoid conflicts with prototype, if I were to use a jquery plugin, could this create conflicts?
[10:38:04] <noregret> pachet: i did a .delay(), i want to execute somthing after the delay time
[10:38:47] <cohitre> vandunk: depending on the plugin implementation. a good implementation shouldn't create conflicts. a bad one may create conflicts.
[10:40:30] <vandunk> cohitre, thanks, i'll try it and see.
[10:40:35] <pachet> noregret: oh sorry, forgot about your earlier question

[10:41:33] <hanleyhansen> hey guys
[10:41:39] <pachet> noregret: something like $('#foo').fadeIn().delay(1000).queue(function ( ) { /* do something here */});

[10:42:25] <pachet> noregret: cool :]
[10:42:55] <sorrymyeng> guys, where is the correct place to write js-code? why "$('[attr^="post"]').css('border','3px dotted black');" does not work if placed before "declaration" of that elements with attr='post...'?
[10:43:07] <hanleyhansen> something like this maybe: http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/058/945/fb27eb5927fb87f23c46dc35696c9d35_large.png?1341628142
[10:43:08] <noregret> i have $('#actionBtns').empty().append('<li>' + d.data + '</li>').hide().fadeIn('slow').delay(1000).fadeOut('slow') where can I put a .addClass() to the appended text ?
[10:43:15] <hanleyhansen> I want it to have a horizontal UI
[10:43:41] <pachet> sorrymyeng: because those elements don't yet exist in the DOM when your script executes
[10:44:32] <hanleyhansen> @pachet think you can help me?
[10:45:06] <sorrymyeng> pachet: i get it, but how to tell it execute after loading of all document?
[10:46:15] <pachet> sorrymyeng: usually you can get away with just putting any dom-dependent script tags right before the </body> close tag
[10:46:52] <sunbeam> whats a good link to use to have a certain wordpress blog post twittered?
[10:47:21] <pachet> hanleyhansen: im not an expert on what plugins are out there, but google says http://www.yoxigen.com/yoxview/
[10:48:06] <sorrymyeng> pachet: thanks, captain:)
[10:48:11] <hanleyhansen> pachet: ok thanks
[10:48:47] <pachet> sunbeam: i'll admit that i'm not one for social media, but what exactly does 'twittered' mean
[10:48:57] <noregret> can I use .addClass() on the appended element and not on the original selector ?
[10:49:15] <dismist> yes
[10:49:46] <noregret> $('.keywords.index').empty().append("<span>Nothing found!</span>").hide().fadeIn('slow').addClass('message'); is adding the class to the original selector
[10:49:50] <noregret> dismist: ^
[10:49:59] <LindsayMac> Quick question.. from a super newbie. I need to animate the transition from addClass and removeClass (or toggleClass).. Do i need to include a specific jquery UI file?
[10:52:07] <LindsayMac> ok yea. Answered my own question
[10:53:17] <NackNick> can someone take a quick look at this, im trying to do a toggleclass and the class just stays inside of the div tag instead of disappearing http://jsfiddle.net/tvyrf/1/
[10:54:02] <noregret> $('.keywords.index').empty().append("<span>Nothing found!</span>").hide().fadeIn('slow').addClass('message'); is adding the class to the original selector, is it possible to add it to the appended <span> ?
[10:54:30] <jfisk87> hey guys
[10:54:52] <jfisk87> hwo cna i calculate the height of a toolbar?
[10:54:54] <jfisk87> so i can account for it
[10:55:23] <pachet> noregret: .fadeIn('slow').children('span').addClass('message') ?
[10:55:33] <pachet> noregret: at this point the chaining is becoming untenable ;]
[10:55:54] <pachet> by toolbar you mean an element in the dom?
[10:55:58] <pachet> jfisk87^
[10:56:13] <jfisk87> pachet: yeah its adding itself in the dom it looks like
[10:56:24] <jfisk87> otherwise it would impact how the rest of the elements in the page are being displayd
[10:57:10] <pachet> have you looked at .height()?
[10:57:11] <jfisk87> like one of these: http://cl.ly/image/3C3x0t3B3O1y
[10:58:35] <cohitre> jfisk87: what do you want to do exactly?
[10:58:55] <pachet> NackNick: '.foo .bar' is a descendent class selector, in your case you just want '.bar'
[10:58:59] <pachet> NackNick:http://jsfiddle.net/zAZvp/
[10:59:02] <jfisk87> cohitre: I have an element that positions itself below a main header
[10:59:23] <jfisk87> the positioning is wrong because it thinks the height is 72px but with the toolbar its more lik 100
[10:59:48] <cohitre> jfisk87: get the position of the main header using offset
[10:59:52] <cohitre> ? offset @ jfisk87
[10:59:53] <bot-t> jfisk87, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[11:00:08] <cohitre> and calculate your position based on the position of the main header
[11:00:14] <jfisk87> ah perfect! thanks cohitre!
[11:06:43] <tempguy> I am trying to match an if condition based on the name of the select but no mater what I put it returns true, if ($('select[name^=randomnonmatchinamenewlist]'))  <--- this matches as well yet nothing of this name exists in the doc , im assuming its a syntax error
[11:07:45] <cohitre> tempguy: that's because the jquery object is truthy regardless of how many elements there are
[11:07:53] <cohitre> tempguy: you have to check the length of the object
[11:08:27] <tempguy> odd I would assume if the object doesnt exist it shouldnt go through but thanks i'll do that
[11:08:54] <zsoc> what happens if i remove a .parent() from a .find? Will it remove the parent() restriction or search nothing?
[11:09:30] <silverwind> Your browser explodes.
[11:09:33] <silverwind> Don't try it.
[11:10:26] <zsoc> silverwind: ...
[11:11:29] <zsoc> i'm using input.find[name="name"].val
[11:11:39] <zsoc> so i suppose input is the selector, so yeah that's a silly question
[11:11:40] <zsoc> thanks

[11:16:44] <zerg> Hi, I am trying to modify this jquery filter through two kinds of elements from this example http://www.designchemical.com/blog/index.php/jquery/live-text-search-function-using-jquery/. In Line 8 I would like to filter through ".accordion h2" OR "navigation li". How can I do that?
[11:19:20] <zsoc> ok my find isn't finding with one of my form displays but is finding fine with the other one. I have an identical hidden field and it has a value/the correct value. how can i debug the scope of input.find ? can i.. somehow.. have it display all input. and see what's in there?
[11:19:34] <zsoc> i make a div with an id and use inner.html?

[11:20:03] <jedimind> setup a test case zsoc
[11:20:40] <zsoc> i would like to but i have no idea what's wrong with it to begin with so i can't duplicate it
[11:21:16] <jedimind> tahts the point of the test case, copy your code as is, isolate the section you're concerned about / is not functioning
[11:21:18] <jedimind> into a test case
[11:22:08] <andrewhl> I've got a very simple script that just fades in an absolutely position div on mouseenter of the parent element, and fades it out on mouseleave. My problem is that if you mouseover and out repeatedly, the fade animation repeats over and over again. How can I prevent the animation from starting again until the last fadeout has finished? http://jsfiddle.net/vmqLm/
[11:24:04] <zsoc> I guess it's safe to assume that if input.parent().find is working properly when given X input, and not working properly when given Y input, than they have different parents
[11:25:09] <phschwartz> What is the best way to disply a json return from an ajax call as a string in a div? I want to keep it in the text representation in order to allow copy and paste of the object for a user (it is a config blurb)
[11:26:30] <zsoc> hm, would the .parent() of an <input be the parent dom, or another <input immediately above it?
[11:27:37] <zsoc> ok i think the answer is yes. so a parent isn't the dom element that is containing it, it's the element directly above it
[11:30:07] <zsoc> ohhhhh it's 2 levels up. i wonder if i can use .parent().parent() , that way work
[11:30:17] <NoiseEee> zsoc: ???
[11:30:31] <NoiseEee> zsoc: http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[11:30:47] <_gates> Why doesnt bind resize work on the resize of the browser on IE?
[11:30:50] <_gates> my code: http://codepad.org/4F2xBhgh
[11:30:51] <zsoc> ahahah that worked
[11:31:11] <zsoc> NoiseEee: i looked at the man page, couldn't figure it out. anyway .parent().parent() worked
[11:31:16] <zsoc> whether it's right or not i have no idea
[11:31:24] <zsoc> sorry for rubber ducking in here, like always.. but it always gets the job done
[11:31:44] <jedimind> zsoc, also .parents() is your friend
[11:31:56] <zsoc> jedimind: oh sounds like fun! ty
[11:32:45] <_gates> The code works fine in all other browsers
[11:32:48] <_gates> but IE doesn't like me
[11:32:52] <_gates> am I doing something wrong?
[11:32:53] <NoiseEee> ah-ha, jedimind's parents are his friends!!
[11:33:04] <_gates> $(window).bind('resize', function() { iframeFix(); }).trigger('resize');
[11:33:11] <jedimind> NoiseEee, true story
[11:33:13] <_gates> of course iframeFix() is a function i wrote :o
[11:33:56] <loincloth> so
[11:33:56] <b-ot> loincloth, it possible to, you know, fix it?*
[11:34:05] <loincloth> whut
[11:34:19] <jedimind> you heard the bot
[11:34:22] <jedimind> b-ot, you're a bot
[11:34:22] <b-ot> jedimind, no YOU'RE a bot
[11:34:33] <loincloth> well met
[11:34:34] <anew_> http://pastebin.com/krYCRD4N i am using this jq code and passing 'item' into the template, but it never shows up in the template?
[11:34:35] <jedimind> b-ot, so ?
[11:34:35] <b-ot> jedimind, Ask again later.
[11:34:38] <jedimind> b-ot, so ?
[11:34:40] <b-ot> jedimind, Yes.
[11:34:47] <jedimind> not a very smart bot
[11:34:50] <anew_> the template is below
[11:35:11] <jedimind> ohhh resig's microtemplating sees the light of day
[11:35:11] <anew_> just not sure what steps i'm missing
[11:35:30] <loincloth> i'm seeing behavior where i make an element like $('<span>') and then try to append it N times to some container but it only gets appended 1 time
[11:35:36] <jedimind> anew_, can i suggest abstracting it into a real templating language like mustache?
[11:35:43] <loincloth> is that normal? or am i doing something wrong somewhere
[11:35:43] <jedimind> i mean its a complete departure from what you're doing, but it's the better approach
[11:36:21] <anew_> jedimind sure, i can look at that... but i would also like to see what i'm doing wrong here for learning purposes
[11:36:43] <jedimind> anew_, do you mind putting together a jsfiddle instead? easier to debug
[11:36:58] <anew_> k
[11:37:17] <jedimind> there's nothing wrong w/ your code from what i can tell, with maybe the exception of iteration logic but i dont recall if that's required in the microtemplate or if it's in the function that references the template
[11:37:28] <jedimind> but either way, if you toss it into a fiddle, its easier to run/debug
[11:39:28] <hph> hi everyone
[11:39:53] <pachet> hi
[11:39:58] <hph> does anyone know how to make a Cancel button in the popup window of BlockUI that reverses the block?
[11:40:06] <loincloth> why do i see 'sup' only once here? http://jsfiddle.net/greatseth/62sNC/
[11:42:02] <nerique> Hello everyone
[11:42:04] <nerique> I have an issue I'm unable to solve with jquery ui sortables. Here's the JSFiddle where you can figure out what's going on: http://jsfiddle.net/nerique/WZVSW/2/ Here's a summary of what I'm trying to do: I have categories, sub-categories and items. categories can be sorted sub-categories can be sorted and dragged into other categories items can be sorted and dragged into other categories or sub-classes. Most of the thing is working 
[11:43:54] <loincloth> all right
[11:43:55] <loincloth> well
[11:44:08] <anew> jedimind u still there?  obv i accidentally unplugged my computer at the perfect moment
[11:44:10] <loincloth> if i create a new element each time i want to append it, it works as i expect
[11:44:16] <loincloth> for anyone following along
[11:44:29] <jfisk87> so if i resize Chrome window.innerHeight is still giving me the same height every time
[11:44:35] <jfisk87> why would it do that?
[11:45:05] <tempguy> is this the right way to check if an element exists in a top document http://jsfiddle.net/zHtP8/
[11:45:11] <tempguy> I keep testing positive
[11:46:18] <anew> tempguy is positive XD
[11:46:41] <eddiemonge> jfisk87: how are you calling that? have you tried restarting chrome?
[11:46:57] <tempguy> anew: its yours by the way =)
[11:46:59] <BillCriswell> tempguy: What happens if you try != instead of !== ?
[11:47:07] <jfisk87> eddiemonge: in a method thats called when theres a scroll. ill try restarting chrome
[11:47:08] <tempguy> jsfiddle complains
[11:47:15] <tempguy> but the results are the same
[11:48:41] <quuxman> has anybody had problems with loading web fonts from https pages?
[11:48:55] <eddiemonge> tempguy: http://jsfiddle.net/zHtP8/1/
[11:49:08] <eddiemonge> quuxman: what kind of problems?
[11:49:19] <eddiemonge> jfisk87: code helps
[11:49:20] <quuxman> I specified my font as a domain relative absolute path from an https page, but Chrome is requesting the font with http, then giving a security warning
[11:49:33] <quuxman> wtf? That is incredibly stupid
[11:50:01] <jfisk87> @ eddiemonge: just calling 			console.log(window.innerHeight and 			console.log($("body").innerHeight()+" inner height of body"); for now
[11:50:01] <quuxman> however, if I specify the font with an absolute https url, it shows no warning
[11:50:12] <quuxman> I want fonts to be requested with http from http pages, and https from https pages
[11:51:26] <quuxman> is there a chrome browser channel where I can bitch about this?
[11:51:41] <tempguy> eddiemonge: thanks that worked!
[11:51:53] <eddiemonge> quuxman:  what happens if you try to load the font directly by typing in the url?
[11:52:01] <jfisk87> ah
[11:52:07] <jfisk87> just realized it doenst matter if theres a resize
[11:53:39] <quuxman> eddiemonge: if I copy and paste the url from the css link in the resource tab in the console, it downloads of course
[11:53:53] <nerique> ON the jsfiddle, try to drag item from the second category to the first category. It won't work. Unless while dragging the item, you scroll up the page :( strange behaviour. Or also unless you expand all the categories by default, but this is not what I want. Any help would be greatly appreciated :)
[11:54:00] <nerique> I have an issue I'm unable to solve with jquery ui sortables. Here's the JSFiddle where you can figure out what's going on: http://jsfiddle.net/nerique/WZVSW/2/ Here's a summary of what I'm trying to do: I have categories, sub-categories and items. categories can be sorted sub-categories can be sorted and dragged into other categories items can be sorted and dragged into other categories or sub-classes. Most of the thing is working 
[11:54:04] <quuxman> fonts are just obscenely idiotic
[11:54:22] <eddiemonge> quuxman: is it a local link? or do you have a url?
[11:54:26] <quuxman> it works fine with my flash assets... they're served over https on https pages and http on http pages
[11:55:14] <quuxman> eddiemonge: https://dev-1.newhive.com/lib/fonts/arvo/Arvo-Regular-webfont.woff?91a5b397
[11:55:58] <eddiemonge> quuxman:  that server doesnt look like its configed properly
[11:56:09] <|max|> hi
[11:56:12] <quuxman> eddiemonge: not surprising... but how so?
[11:57:29] <|max|> i want to create a bar at the bottom of a page but that does not charge when I change page how i can ?
[11:57:48] <quuxman> |max|: put your page in an iframe?
[11:57:58] <|max|> iframe :(
[11:58:09] <|max|> i don t want iframe :(
[11:58:17] <[web][dev]> Perhaps ajax?
[11:58:30] <|max|> yes there are tuto ?
[11:58:43] <quuxman> |max|: that's definitely the easiest option. You could request a hunk of html from your server with $.getJSON...
[11:58:46] <|max|> i don t know what i search at google
[11:58:57] <NoiseEee> |max|: frames, really.
[11:59:09] <quuxman> really that's what frames are fore
[11:59:17] <|max|> frames
[11:59:21] <quuxman> eddiemonge: am I missing a magic header?
[11:59:24] <|max|> there are frame with jquery ?
[11:59:30] <[web][dev]> do people still use frames..?
[11:59:51] <quuxman> [web][dev]: are you joking? iframes are used all over the fucking place... youtube embeds?
[12:00:02] <eddiemonge> quuxman:  not sure. got distracted
[12:00:08] <|max|> iframes it s not good :(
[12:00:08] <[web][dev]> iframes yes.. I thought the old fashioned frames
[12:00:25] <quuxman> [web][dev]: no, nobody uses old fashioned frames :-P
[12:00:36] <|max|> how use facebook for the chat ?
[12:00:45] <[web][dev]> Then I guess ajax is your easiest approach if you do not want iframes
[12:00:54] <eddiemonge> quuxman: does that server have a proper cert?
[12:01:00] <[web][dev]> facebook for the chat? I do not get it.
[12:01:04] <quuxman> eddiemonge: no, just a snake-oil cert
[12:01:26] <quuxman> eddiemonge: but it should still be requesting a domain relative path with https
[12:01:42] <quuxman> eddiemonge: unless there's some stupid font-specific rule... which I know there are others
[12:02:10] <eddiemonge> quuxman:  when i visited the url, chrome blocked it and i had to click to configure
[12:02:31] <quuxman> eddiemonge: right, but I already accepted that cert
[12:02:34] <quuxman> eddiemonge: that shouldn't be a problem
[12:03:06] <|max|> http://www.canpages.ca/business/ON/brooklin/art-galleries-and-dealers/2878-034800.html
[12:03:08] <|max|> i want this bar
[12:03:33] <eddiemonge> quuxman: not sure then but it looks to be a server issue
[12:03:35] <anew> http://pastebin.com/krYCRD4N
[12:03:39] <NoiseEee> |max|: css
[12:03:49] <anew> anyone can help with this why i'm getting ishilited is not definted
[12:04:11] <|max|> but it recharges
[12:04:31] <NoiseEee> |max|: wat
[12:04:31] <b-ot> microsoft does heck microsoft even has dos support in the form of the command line cmd and there are parts of windows 3 in xp and vista
[12:06:49] <|max|> facebook for chat use ajax ?
[12:07:11] <anew> wut
[12:07:11] <b-ot> how you see pual_irish these are these online?
[12:11:46] <Jumpy> Hi. I've got a question about the jQuery.post() shorthand for jQuery.ajax(): is there a way to set the encoding of the parameters when using post()? like setting contentType when calling ajax?
[12:12:36] <noregret> why is $('#actionBtns').empty().fadeOut('slow'); not fading out ?
[12:14:40] <NoiseEee> noregret: maybe because you're fading out content that has already disappeared?  unless that <div> has borders or is physically identifiable without content in it
[12:17:26] <noregret> NoiseEee: i think you're right, what can i do then to fix that ? i want to fade out the elements as they are emptied
[12:17:50] <NoiseEee> break it up
[12:18:04] <NoiseEee> fade out and then empty
[12:18:21] <shoky> Jumpy: use ajax()
[12:18:36] <BillCriswell> noregret: You can do $('#actionBtns').fadeOut('slow', funciton(){ $(this).empty(); });
[12:18:54] <Jumpy> shoky: Thanks. I am doing that. Just wondered if I was being stupid or something.
[12:19:31] <shoky> Jumpy: most of the smarties use $.ajax for everything
[12:20:06] <Jumpy> shoky: It had the funny effect of not being able to log in if your password contained an Umlaut and your browser was set to UTF-8. Spent some time hunting that down...
[12:20:19] <BillCriswell> function*
[12:21:47] <anew> http://pastebin.com/krYCRD4N how do i pass 'item' to my template ?
[12:22:23] <BillCriswell> anew: addEntry( item );
[12:23:30] <hph> http://bpaste.net/show/4b0h06Sg2glwm9vAmNln/
[12:23:41] <anew> BillCriswell but none of the data is displaying with that
[12:23:43] <hph> does anyone have any idea about why that might not be working?
[12:24:53] <shoky> hph: wtf is $.blockUI
[12:25:12] <hph> the BlockUI plugin
[12:25:30] <hph> http://jquery.malsup.com/block/#overview
[12:25:55] <shoky> so is it only the cancel button not working?
[12:26:10] <shoky> not working as an error description is as bad as it gets
[12:26:21] <hph> sorry, should have specified:
[12:26:45] <hph> the block box comes up fine complete with message and cancel button, but clicked the cancel button has no effect
[12:27:08] <shoky> yeah cause when you do $(#Cancel)  the cancel button has to already be in the DOM
[12:27:16] <shoky> or that will select nothing
[12:27:39] <shoky> either bind it after the button is in the DOM, or use event delegation - see ?on
[12:27:40] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:27:56] <io__> hi I d like ot draw some line and animate them, osme kind of dynamic diagram, I had a look at svg but cross browser compliance seems ot be an issue, any other  option?
[12:28:18] <hph> shoky, i'm extremely new to JS and the DOM, I'm doing this for an application fix I've been assigned as an intern at work :P
[12:28:29] <hph> so, what exactly would I do to make it work?
[12:29:11] <shoky> hph:  instead of $(#Cancel).click(      do:     $(document).on(click, #Cancel, function() { ...
[12:29:32] <hph> ah, thanks
[12:30:12] <anew> shaky how do i pass data from item into the template ? http://pastebin.com/PAsXvCG0
[12:30:15] <BillCriswell> shoky: Basically... you'd observe all click events on the document then whenever the event happens you can check to see if it matches a certain selector.
[12:30:56] <scmods> io__: not really jquery.. but i've had success with canvas, explorercanvas.js, and thejit.org
[12:30:57] <shoky> BillCriswell: yes
[12:31:08] <anew> shoky
[12:31:11] <BillCriswell> I meant to say that to hph haha.
[12:31:14] <BillCriswell> Sorry dude.
[12:31:18] <shoky> ;P
[12:31:34] <BillCriswell> I just want him to be able to explain it well.
[12:31:57] <shoky> if he wanted to do that hed read the docs i linked him to ;P
[12:33:39] <BillCriswell> anew: Where are you getting your "item" variables from?
[12:34:13] <anew> i'm having difficulty creating that object... i am creating it in the php file that the ajax calls
[12:34:23] <anew> i retrieve that object, then go to addEntry
[12:34:37] <BillCriswell> Are you getting it as JSON?
[12:34:59] <anew> what exactly does the object structure need to be? array? object? var data = { fname : "fred" }; ? i just dont knwo how to build it
[12:35:24] <shoky> it needs to be an object that has all the fields you are referencing in the template
[12:35:43] <shoky> i think.. never used _.template myself
[12:35:54] <BillCriswell> item = { is_highlighted:true, is_spon: false } etc.
[12:36:06] <BillCriswell> Are you just getting one result from your php file?
[12:36:49] <Timpet> if a bad request is made with $.POST() how can i handel this?
[12:37:13] <shoky> Timpet: whats bad about it?
[12:37:32] <Timpet> The ajax rquest uses success: success, and error: error
[12:37:46] <Timpet> shoky perhaps the server is down
[12:37:56] <Timpet> Or a long reply
[12:38:04] <shoky> youd use the error callback then..
[12:38:04] <quuxman> there must bo a chrome browser channel...
[12:38:09] <hph> shoky, this is what I have now but it isn't working at all: http://bpaste.net/show/ArCjjzqePNZtL2QlcepN/
[12:38:09] <Timpet> so the post times out
[12:39:01] <shoky> Timpet: $.post(bla.php).done(function(){yay}).fail(function(){boo});
[12:39:34] <shoky> ah hph you did what i said literally :)
[12:39:34] <Timpet> thanks shoky, ill give that a try
[12:39:46] <hph> shoky: yes
[12:39:54] <shoky> hph:  line 10 should be:  $(document).on(click, #Cancel, function() {
[12:39:58] <hph> you have to realize that I have no idea what i'm doing :P
[12:39:59] <shoky> wer
[12:40:00] <shoky> er
[12:40:08] <shoky> hph:  line 10 should be:  $(document).on(click, #Cancel, function() {
[12:40:19] <hph> thanks

[13:09:40] <mikehaas763> shoky: Thank you. To prevent the NaN error, what would you do? Put in a condition to check that it is != NaN? Or is there a better way?
[13:10:08] <shoky> mikehaas763: figure out what you want to happen, then proceed to make it happen
[13:10:15] <jedimind_> if ($(input1).val() && $(input2).val()) { .............. }
[13:10:54] <shoky> i dont see that NaN as an error, its very informational
[13:11:21] <jonathancutrell> oh you guys.
[13:11:22] <shoky> informative even
[13:11:26] <mikehaas763> shoky: it IS very informational but probably not to my end users
[13:11:35] <ChkDigit> How do you restrict the depth of a search to only the most immediate children of a dom object?
[13:11:39] <jonathancutrell> nah man. Everyone knows Number is always capitalized.
[13:11:43] <jedimind_> informationalative
[13:11:44] <shoky> mikehaas763: thats the part about figuring out what you _want_ to happen
[13:12:09] <jonathancutrell> ChkDigit: probably in the children() method
[13:12:23] <gus___> ChkDigit: http://api.jquery.com/children/
[13:12:42] <gus___> "The .children() method differs from .find() in that .children() only travels a single level down the DOM tree while .find() can traverse down multiple levels to select descendant elements (grandchildren, etc.) as well. "
[13:12:50] <shoky> no thats too intuitive, find me a different solution!
[13:12:57] <jonathancutrell> ChkDigit: http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/
[13:13:11] <jonathancutrell> ChkDigit: That is an immediate child selector, albeit a sorta slow one.
[13:14:01] <ChkDigit> Yeah, I'm worried that searching children().find("item") will find all of the items in the children too.
[13:14:19] <jonathancutrell> .find() returns one element.
[13:14:34] <jonathancutrell> nope.
[13:14:34] <jonathancutrell> t
[13:14:36] <jonathancutrell> hat's not true.
[13:14:39] <jonathancutrell> Sorry.
[13:15:04] <jonathancutrell> Use the > child selector.
[13:15:14] <jedimind_> wat
[13:15:23] <shoky> .children(item) ?
[13:15:30] <ChkDigit> lol.
[13:15:48] <jonathancutrell> shoky: .children(item) will return all items matching item.
[13:16:01] <ChkDigit> Will .children('item') not also find grandchild and further as well?
[13:16:03] <shoky> fucking quotes arent showing up :)
[13:16:12] <jonathancutrell> Oh man.
[13:16:13] <jedimind_> why use .find in that case ?
[13:16:14] <shoky> i put em in:(
[13:16:20] <jonathancutrell> .children() only goes one level down.
[13:16:22] <jonathancutrell> so.
[13:16:36] <jonathancutrell> children(filter).first() would give you the first matched element in the immediate children.
[13:16:38] <ChkDigit> if that only goes 1 level, that is what I want.
[13:16:49] <shoky> it was the first answer you got
[13:16:54] <shoky> did you try it yet..
[13:17:11] <jedimind_>  The .children() method differs from .find() in that .children() only travels a single level down the DOM tree while .find() can traverse down multiple levels to select descendant elements (grandchildren, etc.) as well.
[13:17:16] <ChkDigit> shoky: no, I've been on IRC.
[13:17:21] <ChkDigit> =)
[13:17:46] <jedimind_> not bothering to read the 2nd sentence of the documentation on that tag really makes it difficult to help you in future instances
[13:20:38] <anew_> http://pastebin.com/nYeGeygR i want to kill myself, anyone know what the array or object needs to look like so line 35 username appears
[13:21:00] <shoky>  bla('hi')
[13:21:06] <shoky> yay quotes are good
[13:21:26] <jonathancutrell> anew_: Are you in rails?
[13:21:35] <anew_> php
[13:21:44] <jonathancutrell> anew_: wait, is that a mustache tmpl?
[13:21:59] <anew_> microtemplate
[13:22:06] <jonathancutrell> anew_: Sorry - seeing the _. just new.
[13:22:07] <jonathancutrell> now*
[13:22:56] <anew_> just a simple line in php for username to appear
[13:22:59] <shoky> anew:  { username: "lol" }
[13:23:01] <anew_> i know it's so easy but i want to die
[13:23:13] <kratsg> Is anyone here experienced with d3 to help with a simple example?
[13:23:39] <anew_> shoky but what about msg etc... doesnt it need to be an array
[13:24:40] <shoky> anew_:  it doesnt matter what msg looks like, it matters what you're passing to _.template, no?
[13:25:19] <shoky> does your ajax response have 'users' field that is an array of items that look like { "username": "lol" } ?
[13:25:40] <shoky> ah waiit
[13:25:46] <anew_> ok
[13:25:50] <shoky> your earlier paste was better..
[13:26:00] <shoky> because you were actually sending a data object to _.template
[13:26:12] <anew_> i still am here arent i ?
[13:26:17] <shoky> ah sorry
[13:26:35] <shoky> im not too familiar with _.template
[13:26:45] <anew_> gah
[13:26:47] <anew_> kill me
[13:27:10] <shoky> ok looks like you're doing that part fine
[13:27:59] <shoky> well, what does your ajax response look like?
[13:29:32] <anew_> {"status":"success","users":{"is_admin":false,"username":"mike","user_id":"5","is_hilighted":"no"}}
[13:30:03] <shoky> users should be an array
[13:30:20] <shoky> {"status":"success","users":[{"is_admin":false,"username":"mike","user_id":"5","is_hilighted":"no"}]}
[13:30:36] <shoky> as you're calling _.each on it..
[13:31:43] <anew_> i cant tell if u changed anything with what i typed ?
[13:31:50] <shoky> i added []
[13:31:54] <shoky> around that user object..
[13:31:58] <shoky> to make it an array
[13:32:33] <anew_> mmmm
[13:32:34] <anew_> i see
[13:33:02] <anew_> so strange in the code i am pretty sure it's an array
[13:33:12] <shoky> in php?
[13:33:23] <shoky> an object is also an array there no? ;]
[13:33:52] <anew_> http://pastebin.com/g2heNw7X
[13:33:59] <anew_> here is the code creating the json response
[13:34:08] <shoky> $users = array('is_admin' => false, 'username' => 'mike', 'user_id' => '5', 'is_hilighted' => 'no');
[13:34:13] <shoky> that creates an object
[13:34:20] <shoky> one object
[13:34:35] <shoky> (an associative array)
[13:35:03] <anew_> so what should i change there ?
[13:35:13] <shoky> i donno php uhh
[13:35:20] <shoky> but i would guess
[13:35:35] <shoky> $users = array(  array('is_admin' => false, 'username' => 'mike', 'user_id' => '5', 'is_hilighted' => 'no')  );
[13:36:04] <anew_> and then put that inside the json array?
[13:36:06] <anew_> let me try that
[13:36:20] <Mark_Morcom> #php anew_
[13:36:21] <shoky> inside the json object, yes ;)
[13:36:36] <shoky> when you use 'array' with   =>  inside
[13:36:41] <anew_> #php doesnt knwo anything with jq
[13:36:42] <shoky> then you're making an associate array -> an object
[13:36:49] <shoky> associative*
[13:37:05] <shoky> wait
[13:37:10] <shoky> you have 'item' => $users
[13:37:31] <anew_> yeah i just changed that, let me change it back to 'users'
[13:37:34] <shoky> o, k
[13:37:51] <anew_> omfg
[13:37:53] <anew_> it works
[13:38:03] <shoky> ;p
[13:38:05] <anew_> i'm going to go crazy
[13:38:07] <anew_> that is awesome
[13:38:13] <anew_> shoky u are incredible
[13:38:23] <mikehaas763> does jquery have a problem with long id names on form fields?
[13:38:24] <shoky> ;]
[13:38:26] <anew_> time to go do some form of celebration
[13:38:42] <anew_> damn i was stuck on this for so long, well not this part, but the entire process, this was the final piece
[13:38:45] <anew_> damn that's so awesome
[13:38:57] <shoky> glad to help
[13:39:01] <anew_> shoky if ur ever in my side of town lunch is on me
[13:39:09] <shoky> thx
[13:39:59] <anew_> i'm in barcelona btw

[13:40:12] <anew_> ok i need a 5 min celebratio nbreak
[13:42:28] <Mark_Morcom> Perhaps someone can give me a solution here. I basically want to create my own Tabbed interface. I have styled it now I just want to make it work. I have not used the <a> tag, but the click element will be a div. I am not good at Jquery. I have explored using Ajax() etc.. I have explored .show - .hide, but I can't seem to get this right. As a php designer, I am not overly interested in righting a complex js here. I would really lik
[13:42:29] <Mark_Morcom> e there to be a plugin. Any suggestions
[13:54:50] <shoky> ohh barcelona!
[13:55:19] <shoky> i'll remember that :P
[13:56:50] <shoky> Mark_Morcom: you want to write it yourself, or you want a plugin?
[14:07:37] <kvnn> If I'm building an image gallery, it seems that its much faster to have multiple <img> elements and show / hide rather than change the src of a single <img> element. Is this true? If so, why?
[14:07:51] <kvnn> (even if all images are preloaded)
[14:10:52] <shoky> do you have an example site/fiddle?
[14:11:19] <cohitre> kvnn: multiple img elements are also to build a non-js fallback for
[14:11:43] <kvnn> shoky: No, I don't
[14:11:51] <shoky> you can find a lot about what's taking time in the 'timeline' devtools tab
[14:11:55] <shoky> or equivalent
[14:31:39] <zamba> how can i reload a page using javascript?
[14:31:56] <anew_> js or jq
[14:32:16] <ajpiano> samrat_: window.location.reload()
[14:40:48] <noregret> I got a var that has html content, is it possible to render that html in a new page/tab ?
[14:43:24] <troll-boy> noregret, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3841100/write-content-to-new-window-with-jquery
[14:45:08] <FengWong> hey everbody got a question.. how can I compare a string if it contains a substring while being case-insensitive?
[14:49:05] <shoky> FengWong: /subStr/i.test("your string")
[14:49:55] <rue> I never remember, is there a difference between test() and  "your string".match(/substr/i)  in conditionals
[14:50:32] <shoky> test returns a boolean
[14:50:37] <shoky> match returns an array
[14:51:29] <shoky> (or null)
[14:51:34] <danheberden> as does exec on the regex
[14:54:22] <FengWong> okay I'm confused .. just tried your solution shoky  like this "if(/searchtext/i.test(val))" while searchtext contains the actual substring and val the actaul string but it never returns true ?
[14:55:49] <shoky> ?js if ( new RegExp(/searchtext/i).test("I Contain SearchText <-- right There") ) "true"; else "false";
[14:55:50] <bot-t> shoky: "true"
[14:56:10] <shoky> FengWong: i put the new RegExp there cause the bot is stupid, you don't need it
[14:57:05] <shoky> i.e. if ( /searchtext/i.test("I Contain SearchText <-- right There") ) "true"; else "false";
[14:59:04] <shoky> FengWong:  'searchtext' isn't a variable, is it?
[14:59:32] <FengWong> shoky it is a variable the value from an input form
[15:00:06] <shoky> oh
[15:00:51] <shoky> then use:  new RegExp(searchtext,"i").test(val)
[15:00:52] <shoky> i guess
[15:00:55] <noregret> when append()ing, the page scrolls to the appended content, how can I avoid that ? meaning that the page stays in its same scroll spot
[15:01:33] <FengWong> shoky should I ignore RegExp ignore or use :D ?
[15:01:55] <shoky> FengWong: use ;P
[15:02:00] <FengWong> okay :D
[15:03:11] <FengWong> thank you shoky :D Your solution worked very well :)
[15:03:58] <shoky> you can also just do:  if (val.toLowerCase().indexOf(searchtext) != -1)
[15:04:40] <shoky> er searchtext.toLowerCase()  ;P
[15:06:48] <shoky> probably better to, actually
[15:10:55] <LindsayMac> Hey guys.. pachet has been trying to help me with an issue and we were ALMOST there and I completely understood EVERYTHING we were doing for th most part.. then he changed things around and I'm a little lost again. Anyone have a moment to take a loook at some code and help guide me in the right direction?
[15:11:11] <troll-boy> just paste
[15:11:14] <troll-boy> if we know, we help
[15:11:18] <LindsayMac> https://gist.github.com/3132026
[15:11:20] <troll-boy> if we don't.. we sit here silently
[15:11:22] <LindsayMac> https://gist.github.com/3132022
[15:11:22] <troll-boy> or mock you
[15:11:31] <LindsayMac> accepted :\
[15:11:41] <troll-boy> so..
[15:11:44] <troll-boy> what's your issue
[15:12:08] <LindsayMac> So my issue is that he changed around how he initializes the code and I'm not quite understanding it
[15:12:33] <troll-boy> protip: Put a section of comments at the top to say wtf it is, how-tf it works, and wtf your current problem is
[15:12:35] <LindsayMac> I want to basically be able to apply a displaypanel class to all of the panels as they come in to view.. but I only want to apply the tall class to the whitebox on certain elements
[15:13:00] <troll-boy> ok
[15:13:04] <troll-boy> what are these two files?
[15:13:31] <LindsayMac> One is the "plugin" file which basically gets the container that is currently inview
[15:13:36] <LindsayMac> the other is the initialization script.
[15:13:46] <LindsayMac> I should note that I new to javascript but not other languages..
[15:14:09] <LindsayMac> they are heavily commented to try and help me along, but I am a little stuck and figured i would ask
[15:14:18] <troll-boy> apparently new to commenting though, lemme look.. this looks kinda over complicated for what you're doing
[15:14:50] <LindsayMac> troll-boy:  i didnt do the commenting..
[15:15:14] <troll-boy> what's the log to apply .tall to the whitebox
[15:15:21] <samholmes> jQuery falls back on the HTML5 data-attributes for the data() method. But is there a way to have jQuery parse the data in a data-attr? data-foobar="{json:'data'}"  =>  $ele.data('foobar') === {json:'data'};
[15:15:28] <troll-boy> and what specifically are your "panels" and "whitebox" es
[15:15:47] <LindsayMac> troll-boy:  hold on.. i'll paste it in jsfiddle
[15:16:09] <troll-boy> samholmes, google is your friend http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4187032/get-list-of-data-attributes-using-javascript-jquery
[15:16:51] <troll-boy> just re-read...
[15:16:53] <troll-boy> hmm
[15:17:03] <noregret> when append()ing, the page scrolls to the appended content, how can I avoid that ? meaning that the page stays in its same scroll spot
[15:17:32] <troll-boy> samholmes, someting like      $(  $('myObject').attr('data-foobar' ) );
[15:17:56] <troll-boy> noregret, I've never had that as the default action.. lemme look
[15:18:09] <samholmes> troll-boy: I'm confused. You do know what I'm after?
[15:18:40] <troll-boy> <div data-attrib="some:json"> Stuff </div>  you want that some:json parsed and loaded as data right?
[15:19:08] <LindsayMac> troll-boy:  http://jsfiddle.net/4YYnv/5/
[15:19:14] <FengWong> so and there is the next question :D I send a request to a server and the server response with a file...now is the problem: How can I check with filetype it is ?
[15:19:52] <noregret> FengWong: MIME ?
[15:19:53] <samholmes> troll-boy: parsed as JSON
[15:19:55] <samholmes> yes
[15:19:57] <troll-boy> yeah
[15:20:29] <troll-boy> that's what I thought you meant
[15:20:48] <troll-boy> imagine that some:json was actually valid json.. which its not
[15:21:05] <samholmes> string
[15:21:09] <samholmes> http://jsfiddle.net/kgefu/
[15:21:27] <troll-boy> noooo...
[15:23:26] <FengWong> noregret but actual how do I compare the response from the server which is the file with $.mime( ext ) ?
[15:24:15] <samholmes> troll-boy: no?
[15:24:38] <dogmatic69> FengWong: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3741574/jquery-how-to-check-response-type-for-ajax-call
[15:26:11] <noregret> FengWong: the mime type should be in the response header...
[15:26:23] <troll-boy> samholmes, generating a 1-liner for you.. au moment
[15:31:17] <troll-boy> samholmes,  http://jsfiddle.net/kgefu/2/
[15:31:24] <troll-boy> also valid json helps too
[15:32:00] <samholmes> troll-boy: Cool, I'll see how I can use it. :)
[15:32:02] <samholmes> Thanks
[15:33:30] <jost> hi
[15:33:51] <samholmes> Will, $ele.data(obj) remove other keys not included in obj?
[15:34:27] <troll-boy> samholmes?
[15:35:39] <samholmes> troll-boy: $ele.data('foo', 23);  var obj = {bar:11}; /* note: no foo in obj */ $ele.data(obj);  $ele.data('foo') =?= 23?
[15:36:11] <jost> I'm searching for a jquery scrollbar plugin, which allows me to put the scrollbar anywhere on the screen, and which degenerates gracefully, if js is disabled. Does anyone know such a thing?
[15:36:13] <jost> The Scrollbar plugins I found all put the markup of the scrollbar into a container with "overflow:hidden".
[15:36:19] <FengWong> noregret and dogmatic69 : the header of the server response allways tells "text/html" even if it sends a pdf or xml...
[15:36:33] <dogmatic69> then your server is broken
[15:36:45] <noregret> exactly
[15:37:25] <troll-boy> FengWong, see dogmatic69's answer.
[15:38:15] <imanc> anyone know of a decent jquery content slider?
[15:38:38] <FengWong> troll-boy I allready implemented it....but like I said: It allways say "text/html" so if I check for a pdf I'll never find one..
[15:38:58] <troll-boy> Your. Server. Is. Broken.
[15:39:04] <dogmatic69> imanc: there must be a million of them on a google search
[15:39:04] <troll-boy> It is misreporting the mimetype
[15:39:20] <dogmatic69> troll-boy: more like not reporting it at all
[15:40:43] <FengWong> so I can't do anything about it ? except talking to the server admin?
[15:40:51] <troll-boy> FengWong, post me a url to get a pdf
[15:40:56] <troll-boy> I'll check the headers
[15:40:58] <k1ng> can anyone tell me where can i find a good facebook style chat?
[15:41:09] <troll-boy> k1ng, google?
[15:41:15] <k1ng> tried
[15:41:26] <troll-boy> also, you realize such can CRIPPLE your webserver
[15:41:29] <troll-boy> and your db
[15:41:50] <troll-boy> unless you implement it smartly and have a path in place to make it scale..
[15:42:12] <dogmatic69> k1ng: http://socketo.me/demo
[15:42:30] <FengWong> hmm thats a problem troll-boy :/ I'm not allowed to give you any url because it has to contain informations no one except of the developers is allowed to see :(
[15:42:47] <mnewton> Hey guys, I use jquery to dynamically create input fields, but they all have the same name, how do i take all the input fields with the same name and join them with a ,
[15:43:01] <troll-boy> FengWong, then upload a blank PDF saying nothing but "GFYS TROLLBOY" then and link me to that
[15:43:29] <troll-boy> or lemme ask you this
[15:43:34] <k1ng> dobalina, its not really facebook like chat :)
[15:43:41] <troll-boy> how are you telling its "text/html" FengWong ?
[15:43:51] <FengWong> firebug is telling me :)
[15:43:57] <troll-boy> fair enough
[15:44:10] <troll-boy> you using FF?
[15:44:20] <troll-boy> if so check out Firefox LiveHeaders
[15:44:23] <jost> mnewton, you could do that on php side - rename them in to name[], and php automatically creates an array of the values.
[15:44:25] <imanc> do you guys ever hit issues trying to customise existing modules to function and look like the designs (PSDs) you've been provided with?
[15:44:37] <troll-boy> just in case FB is deciding to autoassume a mimetype and tell you that
[15:44:40] <mnewton> jost, I'm using django
[15:45:15] <dogmatic69> imanc: depends who designed it. If its someone that comes from a print background (eg business cards and fliers) good luck
[15:45:35] <dogmatic69> If it is someone that actually knows what a website is, its a lot easier
[15:45:48] <owen1> is there a way to visualize backbone.js views?
[15:46:00] <troll-boy> imanc, I use a service personally
[15:46:16] <troll-boy> send them a psd, they gimme images, html and simple js
[15:46:23] <troll-boy> anything crazy complex I gotta do myself
[15:46:37] <troll-boy> but rollovers, slide panels, etc they're cool with
[15:46:54] <imanc> troll-boy: yeh, I'm a back-end dev by trade and I've always palmed off this work to a front-end guy. But I decided to get to grips with it.
[15:47:11] <imanc> troll-boy: psd2html does look interesting tho
[15:47:31] <troll-boy> imanc, my belief is that if your time is cheap enough to do it, awesome.. in the meantime I'll be using htmlburger
[15:47:32] <io__> hi how do i substitute "129" with " y" ?
[15:47:34] <io__> http://pastebin.com/HuPtvGaV
[15:47:47] <troll-boy> imanc, I don't trust psd <-> html apps

[15:49:50] <Aquaguy> Hello
[15:49:50] <Aquaguy> Is there any way to replace the char code on keydown? I want to replace ',' by '.' in a input (type text)
[15:50:07] <Aquaguy> while the user types
[15:50:29] <imanc> Aquaguy: seems easy enough? grab the field contents and replace chars?
[15:50:44] <Aquaguy> something like prevent default when the keycode is 188 and insert the dot on the caret's position
[15:51:08] <Aquaguy> imanc, I don't want the comma to appear
[15:51:18] <Aquaguy> Have you used Excel?
[15:51:29] <imanc> unfortunately I have
[15:52:00] <Aquaguy> when you type 2,34 you don't even see that you've typed a comma, Excel automatically replaces the comma for a dot
[15:52:04] <Aquaguy> you dopnt have to leave the cell
[15:52:08] <Aquaguy> or whatever
[15:52:13] <thomedy> okay i know that i shouldnt rely on this room but i do have  aquestion i hope its okay....
[15:52:21] <Aquaguy> that's what I'm looking for
[15:52:27] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/gtqZV/1/
[15:52:34] <thomedy> its pure js... and by that i mean no framework
[15:52:38] <thomedy> and my argument isn't passing
[15:52:48] <thomedy> i know its because i pass on a click event
[15:52:59] <thomedy> and then raf's take over without the argument being passed
[15:53:05] <thomedy> i m trying to come up with a solution
[15:53:10] <thomedy> okay thats it
[15:53:18] <thomedy> i would be in the javascript room but it keeps booting me
[15:53:33] <imanc> Aquaguy: how about on keyup replacing instances of , with .    it would create the same effect?
[15:54:14] <Aquaguy> imanc doing that doesn't bring the caret to the end of the value?
[15:54:52] <imanc> Aquaguy: good point
[15:55:27] <LindsayMac> Ok.. so i have this script that I have been working on with pachet and I am having a couple issues, mostly because I am not fully understanding the changes that were made, but the code is seen working here: http://jsfiddle.net/5et3t/32/
[15:56:08] <LindsayMac> The issue is that we have "nested" functions I guess and what I want to do is make sure that ALL of the panels get the function to display when they come in to view, but I dont not want all of them to get the function to addClass 'tall' to the white_box
[15:56:43] <Aquaguy> imanc, yes It moves the caret, just checked it. :(
[15:57:26] <imanc> Aquaguy: would it be enough to keep the caret at the end of the text, or does it need to remain at the replaced text? hmm
[15:58:00] <thomedy> im sorry if i missed an answer ... i got booted again
[15:58:23] <Aquaguy> imanc I might use jcaret plugin
[15:58:41] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[16:01:25] <zamba> i'm looking to create a way of deleting a row from a table (and database), but i need to have a confirmation dialog before actually doing anything
[16:01:31] <zamba> how would i go about doing that?
[16:01:56] <shoky> thomedy: that fiddle doesnt work
[16:02:04] <gus_> zamba: prompt
[16:02:06] <thomedy> i know
[16:02:15] <gus_> http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_popup.asp
[16:02:17] <thomedy> it uses images
[16:02:27] <thomedy> and i dont know how to link images into the fiddle
[16:03:05] <shoky> with a url?
[16:03:13] <thomedy> also the problem i sent it is because im trying to figure out how to get over a problem im having causing it to not work
[16:03:36] <shoky> dont use onload or onclick attributes
[16:03:37] <thomedy> its an onclick event and int he click it passes the argument.... and then raf's take over and the argument is whatever it wants to be
[16:03:39] <shoky> in your html..
[16:03:56] <thomedy> okay so i should use the addEventListener or the elem.onclick
[16:04:04] <thomedy> i didn't know there was a better honestly
[16:04:45] <Guddu> Dear All...Is there a goood substitue of radio button functionality in JQuery? I basically want a screen element that will help me selecting one out of 2 values.
[16:04:46] <LindsayMac> Hey guys..I have some questions about this script I am using. The goal of it is to alter the class of the "#white_box" element based on which panel is viewable in the viewport AND addClass and removeClass to allow me to fade in the content as we come to each panel. My issue is that when working on it, we changed the way the initialization works and now I can't seem to work out how to separate the two http://jsfiddle
[16:04:46] <LindsayMac> .net/5et3t/32/
[16:05:02] <LindsayMac> oops
[16:05:02] <LindsayMac> http://jsfiddle.net/5et3t/32/
[16:06:37] <k1ng> how do i make $.ajax to use iframe?
[16:06:44] <k1ng> for file uploading ?
[16:08:28] <Guddu> Dear All...Is there a goood substitue of radio button functionality in JQuery? I basically want a screen element that will help me selecting one out of 2 values.
[16:08:58] <gus_> You can make almost anything have "radio button functionality"
[16:09:05] <gus_> Guddu ^^
[16:09:07] <ryanneufeld> ^^
[16:10:28] <Guddu> gus_, like what?
[16:10:29] <LindsayMac> Can anyone give a hand with the above posted/
[16:12:16] <Aquaguy> imanc yep, jcaret worked like a charm
[16:12:29] <imanc> Aquaguy: epic, i'll take a look myseldf
[16:16:33] <gus_> Guddu: checkboxes, divs, buttons, just to name a few. You just have to code the logic for their behavior
[16:17:18] <Guddu> gus_, i was looking at something that looks good on UI. Something funky....Like a toggle or something like that. Is there anything native in JQuery?
[16:17:21] <Guddu> Or JQuery UI
[16:17:26] <Guddu> That provides a classy effect
[16:17:46] <gus_> Why are styled radio buttons out of the question?
[16:19:11] <shoky> thomedy
[16:19:18] <thomedy> yes
[16:19:31] <thomedy> i have moved the html click event out to the js
[16:20:15] <shoky> thomedy: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gtqZV/2/
[16:20:16] <thomedy> acutally to be honest i just deleted the click event because i havent added it to the js yet
[16:20:22] <shoky> the main issue was
[16:20:32] <shoky> that you called:  animationFrame(animate)
[16:20:39] <shoky> without passing a parameter to animate ..
[16:20:50] <shoky> so it was passed a timestamp
[16:21:15] <shoky> do you know how to do step-by-step debugging? put breakpoints?
[16:21:29] <thomedy> okay the reason i did that and im open to critisizim... but i read that if i pass a parameter (and i dont remember what article iread this in) was if you do that it passes what it returns and notthe right thing
[16:21:31] <thomedy> but thank you
[16:21:42] <thomedy> i just followed what i found in tuts and docs and articles
[16:21:46] <thomedy> so thank you for fixing me
[16:22:10] <shoky> you don't need any tuts
[16:22:31] <shoky> just know how requestAnimationFrame works exactly, and what it does with the callback you give it
[16:22:34] <thomedy> i read what ever i can find that might help cuz thats all i got
[16:22:48] <shoky> if your animate function needs an img_index parameter, then you need to give it one
[16:22:51] <thomedy> that makes sense
[16:23:32] <shoky> i guess i should've switched that animate(0) to animate(img_index)
[16:23:49] <thomedy> oh yeah i was on test mode and was trying to fish out the bugs
[16:23:58] <thomedy> but in my local machine its back to img_index
[16:24:00] <thomedy> or whatever
[16:24:04] <shoky> yea i mean the one that i added
[16:24:24] <thomedy> oooh okay... i read that constructor notation is better then the literal notation i use
[16:24:29] <thomedy> for oop would you agree
[16:24:48] <thomedy> so function name() = new Object as apposed to something() = {}
[16:25:00] <Aquaguy> imanc http://jsfiddle.net/tU57U/4/ that's what i've done
[16:25:20] <shoky> thomedy nah your code is fine, to me at least
[16:25:42] <thomedy> okay i have been working really hard at just doing the right thing in both code strength and figuring shit out myself
[16:26:07] <shoky> thomedy it's much nicer than your old code that i can remember
[16:26:14] <shoky> good job ;P
[16:26:27] <thomedy> i read taht global objects are no good
[16:26:29] <thomedy> in general
[16:26:32] <thomedy> but i never found out why
[16:26:44] <thomedy> so i didn't care and just switched to my own custom objects
[16:26:47] <danheberden> a literal is faster and more declarative
[16:26:47] <shoky> if you put a (function() { ..... })()   around it
[16:26:51] <shoky> then they will no longer be global
[16:27:08] <thomedy> but isn't that called automaticaly without any event
[16:27:11] <thomedy> thats not always good
[16:27:22] <shoky> var x = 5;  <--- that is also called automatically
[16:27:41] <thomedy> no agreed but sometimes i dont want x to = 5 until i say
[16:27:47] <shoky> so
[16:27:48] <b-ot> shoky, it possible to, you know, fix it?*
[16:27:48] <shoky> ?
[16:27:54] <thomedy> so ihave been straying away from that
[16:27:59] <shoky> fro what
[16:28:15] <thomedy> (function(){});()
[16:28:16] <thomedy> that
[16:28:22] <shoky> i dont see what one has to do with the other
[16:28:22] <thomedy> until it makes sense
[16:28:29] <thomedy> maybe im missing something
[16:28:41] <shoky> all that does is give a function scope to whatever is inside
[16:28:44] <thomedy> but i assumed that if i dont want it called till i say then i dont need that
[16:28:47] <shoky> instead of it being in the global scope
[16:28:56] <shoky> dude
[16:29:00] <shoky> saying:    var x;
[16:29:10] <shoky> or saying:    (function() { var x;  })()
[16:29:12] <thomedy> yeah i read that
[16:29:23] <shoky> is the same... except one is global and one is local
[16:29:29] <shoky> they are both executed "automatically"
[16:29:33] <shoky> so i donno what you mean
[16:29:34] <eip56> Heres a question when do you want to move from a object to a full on pluggin? certain point or just for portability and reuse
[16:29:40] <thomedy> okay yeah i guess you are right
[16:29:48] <thomedy> i hadn't made it to the point in the logic yet
[16:29:54] <thomedy> wher eyou dont do anything if you dont want to
[16:29:56] <thomedy> same same
[16:30:00] <thomedy> just give it scope
[16:30:14] <thomedy> any way
[16:30:18] <thomedy> super sweeet
[16:30:19] <thomedy> back to it
[16:30:29] <thomedy> i had to writ my own easing function
[16:30:52] <shoky> eip56: it's up to you, i'd say ;p
[16:31:07] <thomedy> and i think i when i finish these projects im on want to write a jquery plugin for community use on canvas easing and maybe.... seems cool
[16:31:12] <shoky> eip56: but .. there's no such seperate entity as a jquery plugin
[16:31:14] <eip56> cool i was hoping you'd pipe up shoky ;-p
[16:31:26] <shoky> eip56:  a plugin is usually just a function like any other
[16:31:29] <shoky> so if you made a function
[16:31:32] <shoky> in a .js file
[16:31:37] <shoky> you have made yourself a plugin.
[16:31:59] <shoky> if that function is in $.fn then you have made yourself a jquery plugin
[16:32:31] <thomedy> yeah i was reading a bit about it
[16:32:33] <eip56> yea ive done both to this point just curious when its more practical but seems like im on the right track.. I basically try do do anyhting i dont need in the document.ready outside in objects
[16:32:45] <thomedy> but my point is that i really want to get down and dirty on easing math cuz my function only does what i need it
[16:32:46] <thomedy> to
[16:32:54] <shoky> eip56: the leading principle is to stay DRY
[16:33:00] <thomedy> if i want any thing to really be of use for someone it has to be solid all the way through
[16:33:14] <eip56> what do you mean by 'DRY' shoky
[16:33:21] <shoky> Don't Repeat Yourself
[16:35:27] <eip56> ahh yea i try not to i try to keep it well organized.. im past the just write everthing and move on.. trying to be more modular separate what needs to be separated for reuse and only call whats needed when its needed which is tricky sometimes as i mostly work in templated sites ie: 99% of the site shares the same header.php file
[16:35:38] <thomedy> i just now took a look at the onload thing you did in that js fiddle except for your tweeeks in helps thats my code there yay... not to take credit from your fixes
[16:35:41] <thomedy> thank you very much
[16:37:27] <BFranks> I gotta be doing something wrong.. If I tie a modal dialog to a table item, so that when you click a cell it loads a dialog for cell input, it works fine until I re-fresh the table with AJAX or until I switch themes. Then the item no longer responds.. I know from experience with tablesorter that you have to tell it to re-attach itself after an update, which makes sense but would be a huge amount of maintenance.. I'm guessing most people
[16:37:27] <BFranks> that in a function and call the function after an update?
[16:38:48] <Guddu> is it ok for 2 Radio Type Inputs to have the same name?
[16:39:21] <shoky> Guddu: very ok. that's how you group them together
[16:41:19] <Whirl3d> BFranks, people use delegation to handle the events on the table itself, not the content in the table.
[16:41:59] <Whirl3d> then you can reload the content 100 times and since the table itself hasn't changed (only the contents), your event handlers will still work.
[16:42:22] <Whirl3d> shoky!
[16:46:53] <BFranks> Whirl3d: Yeah I have a feeling there's this large gap of essential info missing and I'm doing everything the hard way.. And yet updating individual table cells seems like more work.. even if it's clearly more efficient..
[16:47:20] <Whirl3d> what do you mean by updating individual table cels?
[16:48:03] <Guest94567> Hello, I'm using Paul Irish's infinite scroll script. Link: http://pastebin.com/DL6dYPMY How would I go about executing another script everytime Infinite scroll executes?
[16:48:18] <BFranks> Aren't you suggesting that if some of the DB data changes, instead of re-drawing the whole table, I'd just change the data in a cell?
[16:48:54] <Whirl3d> Bfranks, you probably have something like this  $(table cell).click(function () { showModal(something)})
[16:49:24] <Whirl3d> so then when the new table is loaded (or the new theme, for example), you have to rerun that click function handler every time
[16:49:54] <Whirl3d> Instead you could do $("table").on("click", "cellclass", function (e) { showModal......
[16:50:03] <Whirl3d> and it would handle it for all cells all the time
[16:50:27] <Whirl3d> whether loaded in the future, new skins, doesn't matter because the handler isn't being replaced when the cells are
[16:51:43] <BFranks> yeah.. sorta what I'm doing.. hmmm .. why do I ask questions after 4pm.. lemme splash some water on my face and see if I can switch over to that format..
[16:52:36] <Whirl3d> if you paste your code, html, js and css to jsfiddle.net, it makes it a lot easier to get help in here. Then people can demonstrate on your code and share the link back here for you to see
[16:53:48] <BFranks> I know but the whole thing is tied very closely to a mysql db and other crap.. I almost think I should program with non-private data so I can quickly export a demo of my issues ti JSFiddle
[16:54:47] <Whirl3d> just export a subset of your data in JSON format and copy the JSON object to the top of your fiddle...then the AJAX part (to the PHP script) just comment out and use the JSON object instead
[16:59:10] <shoky> halu
[17:01:02] <beasty> evening all
[17:02:20] <Whirl3d> Evening beasty
[17:09:14] <thirdender> I'm having trouble with the jQuery UI dialogs, using 1.8.21 hosted on Google's CDN (loaded asynchronously by yepnope). When one of the dialogs is open, there's an empty space that appears at the bottom of the page the same height as the open dialog. See http://www.echolivechat.com/new.html, click the "Client Login" link at the top or bottom, then scroll down to the bottom of the page to see what I mean. Anyone know how to fix this?
[17:09:21] <BFranks> I use this $( "#meter" ).click(function() {$( "#dialog-form" ).dialog( "open" );}); to bring up the dialog box Looking at your suggestion it should be: $("#meter").on("click", "cellclass", function (e) { $( "#dialog-form" ).dialog( "open" );});? ?
[17:10:22] <Whirl3d> what is #meter? Is that the table?
[17:10:40] <BFranks> And that's for a <meter id="meter" value="0.1">10</meter>
[17:10:46] <BFranks> in a cell
[17:11:01] <Whirl3d> but that cell can change or be deleted, right?
[17:11:11] <Whirl3d> not just it's contents, but the entire cell
[17:11:51] <BFranks> Well the page looks for changes in the DB and if it sees something new it reloads the whole DIV the table is sitting in with AJAX/PHP
[17:12:52] <BFranks> The only time it doesn't reload the table is for things like dates where the data self changes.. but in the case of a <meter> </meter> I've gotta apply the new values after they have been set in the modal dialog that pops up.. ?
[17:13:01] <thirdender> BFranks: then you want to bind the event handler to something that isn't reloaded, and tell it to listen for clicks inside on elements that match a certain selector...
[17:13:14] <Whirl3d> okay. if you can't change the back end, then you bind the handler to the div
[17:15:02] <thirdender> BFranks: $("selector for DIV that doesn't reload").on("click", "selector for element that gets clicked", function() { ... })
[17:15:10] <BFranks> Ahhh I think I get it.. so I could bind it to something more explicit like document->table->tr->td->#meter ?
[17:15:18] <BFranks> Oh
[17:15:48] <diverdude> ohhhh how i love spending a whole day debugging just to find out i have placed a line of code 10 lines below where it should have been :/
[17:18:57] <jfisk87> i hate toolbars
[17:19:00] <jfisk87> especially ones in chrome
[17:19:00] <BFranks> So right now my <div id="scheduletable"> is holding the <table id="myTable">  which holds the <meter id="meter"> and gets re-drawn with .innerhtml .. but if I put that inside another DIV, like <div id="main"> and point to it like $("#main").on("click","#meter",function(){$( "#dialog-form" ).dialog( "open" );});  That should work?
[17:19:38] <jfisk87> for the StumbleUpon toolbars (and others that insert a div as the first child of the body) how can i sett css properties for other elements so they arent going under? http://cl.ly/image/1o1L3A2G0X46
[17:19:58] <jfisk87> i.e, if i want a css property top set at 0 it shouldnt be covered up by the toolbar like it is now
[17:19:59] <thirdender> BFranks: yes, I think so (haven't been following the whole conversation)... you might also be able to bind it to $("#scheduletable").on("click", "#meter", ...) if you're replacing the innerHTML on that DIV
[17:20:10] <thirdender> BFranks: (without needing to add another wrapper)
[17:20:31] <BFranks> Oh yeah.. it never goes away... lemme try that.. :)
[17:20:33] <Fermx> hi
[17:22:39] <BFranks> Yay!!

[17:28:59] <thirdender> Has anyone encountered problems with jQuery UI dialogs putting empty space at the end of the page when open?
[17:33:24] <Forbidd3n> Anyone that can give me a clear definition of what would cause this error, please
[17:33:25] <Forbidd3n> NetworkError: 406 Not Acceptable
[17:34:46] <Forbidd3n> I get this error in Firebug 1.10 Firefox 13.0.1
[17:34:55] <Forbidd3n> and Google Chrome as well
[17:35:42] <thirdender> Forbidd3n: The web server has determined it isn't able to send data in a format that would be accepted by the browser...
[17:36:58] <thirdender> Forbidd3n: before the data transfer happens, some minor negotiation happens, and the browser sends (along with the initial request) the types of data it can receive (for example, older browsers didn't always accept Gzip'ed responses, so newer browsers tell the web server they can take Gzip responses and the server responds in kind)
[17:37:11] <thirdender> Forbidd3n: it's generally a server-side configuration problem
[17:38:04] <Forbidd3n> It is happening on the jquery.upload.js file
[17:38:31] <Forbidd3n> It works intermittently
[17:39:16] <Forbidd3n> thirdender: I read something in regards to mod_Security on the server
[17:39:23] <Forbidd3n> relevant?
[17:39:36] <thirdender> Forbidd3n: not sure off the top of my head... http://lagoscript.org/jquery/upload is the code you used?
[17:40:13] <Forbidd3n> yep
[17:40:31] <Forbidd3n> ?
[17:44:19] <Forbidd3n> thirdender: ?
[17:44:24] <thirdender> Forbidd3n: hmm... not sure :-p did you see http://urbangiraffe.com/2005/08/20/mysterious-406-error/ ?
[17:44:40] <thirdender> Forbidd3n: are you able to add an .htaccess file to disable mod_security and try it?
[17:45:24] <Forbidd3n> yeah would that be a server security hole or does that really matter
[17:46:13] <thirdender> Forbidd3n: I'm not 100% sure. btw, have you checked the logs? I think somewhere along the line one of the logs (access.log, error.log, ???.log) should have a clue...
[17:46:49] <Forbidd3n> ah, didn't think of that one sec
[18:24:59] <Guddu> Is it a good practice to dynamically add <input> html elements and then pass them on to Form Post Data?

[18:33:32] <LindsayMac> theres a big gapping space between those ears..
[18:34:10] <fission6> why is overlay indented so much, just curious
[18:34:26] <LindsayMac> fission6:  no reason.. just how it happened..
[18:34:46] <tw2113> spacebar abuser!
[18:36:06] <LindsayMac> im in a LOT of testing right now, so you should be happy that my code is organized.. LOL because before it was all over the place
[18:36:06] * tw2113 calls the EPA
[18:36:08] <LindsayMac> epa?
[18:36:08] <tw2113> sounded good
[18:36:17] <LindsayMac> the KWS
[18:36:17] <LindsayMac> keystroke welfare society
[18:36:17] <LindsayMac> but anyways.. why isnt that fading in ?
[18:36:17] <fission6> LindsayMac: whats the 1000 in addClass doing?
[18:36:27] * tw2113 resists the snark in his head
[18:36:27] <fission6> and also does adding the class display the element?
[18:36:51] <LindsayMac> fission6:  using the jquery UI but i supposed I can remove that if I am going to use .animate
[18:36:54] <LindsayMac> and yes.. it does.
[18:37:04] <LindsayMac> it goes from visibility:hidden to visibility:visible
[18:37:05] <fission6> but thats whta fadeIn does
[18:38:04] <LindsayMac> yea. I just removed it. Forgot about it
[18:38:15] <fission6> better results?
[18:39:23] <LindsayMac> fission6:  nope just came up with a little issue.. removing the , 1000 broke it. When i'm not using UI do I need to use double quotes?
[18:40:37] <fission6> what does displaypanel do?
[18:40:49] <fission6> can you just fadeIn() why do you need addClass
[18:41:17] <LindsayMac> Oh weird.. shoot.. now i got a whole new issue..
[18:41:32] <LindsayMac> the out isn't working the way it was before. It's not removing the class.
[18:41:37] <LindsayMac> whats with the mass exodus!?
[18:43:04] <imachuchu> LindsayMac: think it's a server thing, hit the #git board too at the same time
[18:43:30] <LindsayMac> its crazy..
[18:44:01] <LindsayMac> ok so fission6 .. if i remove the jquery UI 1000 so I need to put the class in double quotes?
[18:44:55] <fission6> yes you need quotes
[18:45:22] <LindsayMac> fission6:  double quotes though.. right?
[18:45:53] <fission6> dont matter
[18:46:06] <xboi209> wtf
[18:46:20] <LindsayMac> fission6:  https://gist.github.com/1639173f7cb95f2a6e03
[18:47:21] <LindsayMac> ahhh i just read you are supposed to use the css display:none and not visibility:hidden .. is this true?
[18:47:41] <tw2113> depends
[18:47:43] <fission6> yes, you can use hide() and show()
[18:47:49] <tw2113> do you want to hide but not remove from the dom?
[18:47:55] <fission6> but the point is your addClass() isn;t needed
[18:48:22] <tw2113> ?g display vs visibility css
[18:48:23] <bot-t> tw2113, CSS Display and Visibility - http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_display_visibility.asp
[18:48:24] <fission6> if all it oes is do display:block;
[18:48:24] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  yes
[18:48:49] <LindsayMac> I do not want to remove it from the dom because I need elements contained in it to trigger other actions
[18:49:00] <tw2113> "visibility:hidden hides an element, but it will still take up the same space as before. The element will be hidden, but still affect the layout."
[18:49:03] <LindsayMac> fission6:  but is hide() the same as visibility:hidden
[18:49:09] <tw2113> "display:none hides an element, and it will not take up any space. The element will be hidden, and the page will be displayed as if the element is not there:"
[18:49:10] <fission6> no
[18:49:13] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  yes I know.. that is what i want \
[18:49:22] <fission6> just remove the damn addClass()
[18:49:25] <tw2113> then you have your answer :D
[18:49:26] <LindsayMac> fission6:  so how do i make an element there but gone?
[18:49:34] <fission6> hide()
[18:49:40] <fission6> or add a class with display:none;
[18:49:44] <LindsayMac> and then show() or fadeIn()
[18:49:48] <fission6> right
[18:49:51] <LindsayMac> fission6:  i cant use display:none
[18:49:55] <fission6> but dont add a class that shows it
[18:50:00] <fission6> then fadeIN
[18:50:01] <LindsayMac> but i didnt realize it needed display:none ... i thought you can use visibility
[18:50:05] <LindsayMac> k
[18:50:13] <fission6> well read tw2113 link above
[18:50:51] <LindsayMac> fission6:  another question... the default css is to hide  all of the .panel boxes.. so what would the syntax for the code look like to hide everything on initiation o
[18:51:17] <LindsayMac> $('.panel').hide();    ??
[18:52:23] <LindsayMac> ok so hide() adds display:none .. i do NOT want that..
[18:52:27] <LindsayMac> I can NOT have the display be none
[18:52:57] <LindsayMac> So how do I fade content in without using display:none
[18:53:15] <fission6> is there a live link somewhere
[18:54:03] <k1ng__> is there any ajax uploader?
[18:54:25] <LindsayMac> fission6:  i just PMed you
[18:55:02] <fission6> LindsayMac: i cant get this involved right now sorry, dont want to over commit
[18:55:25] <LindsayMac> ok... i understand the basics.. but i just need to know how you can fade in using something other than display:none
[18:57:35] <LindsayMac> So does anyone have any thoughts as to how to fade in content that is in a visibility:hidden block versus display:none? I can not mess up the dom
[18:58:49] <gus_> LindsayMac: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2435751/jquery-fade-element-does-not-show-elements-styled-visibility-hidden
[18:59:24] <LindsayMac> gus ohh cool.. I will try that .
[18:59:56] <gus_> chaining functions ftw :)
[19:00:49] <LindsayMac> quick swap
[19:02:22] <fission6> LindsayMac:
[19:02:24] <LindsayMac> gus_:  that totally seems to work
[19:02:24] <fission6> http://jsfiddle.net/36Z49/
[19:02:34] <LindsayMac> but it SEEMS like no matter what i can't change the duration
[19:03:09] <LindsayMac> fission6:  that could work too
[19:03:42] <Whirl3d> LindsayMac, are you using jquery transit plugin?
[19:03:53] <LindsayMac> Whirl3d:  i dont know what that is
[19:04:30] <Whirl3d> It's a great library of css3 animation replacements for jquery. No work, just automatically replaces your jquery animations with hardware accellerated css3 transrforms
[19:04:48] <LindsayMac> Whirl3d:  i dont know that I need that much..
[19:04:57] <LindsayMac> fission6:  strangely, that code doesn't work..
[19:06:12] <LindsayMac> meaning - the opacity changes, but it doesnt make it.. doh.. nevermind!
[19:13:30] <LindsayMac> gus_:  you can set the fadein by ms right??? is there a max? because it seems like no matter how hard I try, I cant egt it to fade in slow enough
[19:18:25] <gaius65> Any idea why a animation from left:22% to left:0; can not look smooth, but like the first half is missing?
[19:20:09] <Whirl3d> Soo many reasons it's hard to say without seeing your code. Usually, it has something to do with the need to change position models from px-based to percentage base, from displya:relative to display:absolute or something like that taking up the first part of th animation time
[19:20:30] <Whirl3d> I find that I get better results by animating the margins
[19:25:10] <quuxman> how do I specify a click handler than doesn't trigger unless no other handlers were called?
[19:25:25] <quuxman> (without calling cancel bubble on all other handlers)
[19:27:01] <Whirl3d> in all of the handlers you put a conditional statement to check for a shared global?
[19:27:17] <rmurphey> quuxman: yes, if you control all handlers you could have them set a flag
[19:27:21] <rmurphey> what is the use case?
[19:27:53] <Whirl3d> $("element").click(function (e) { if (triggered) return; triggered=true; doStuf();});
[19:28:05] <quuxman> I have a iframe with who knows what content in it, and in this frame I want to create a default handler so if you click and nothing else would've been triggered, it sends a message to the parent frame
[19:28:51] <Whirl3d> set the click handler on the parent container and be sure to preventDefault in your other click handlers.
[19:28:52] <quuxman> these frames have a background element, so I think I'll just set the click handler on there, and call it good
[19:29:09] <rmurphey> Whirl3d: you'd have to stopPropagation to prevent bubbling
[19:29:10] <quuxman> it just won't work if you click on any other element
[19:29:28] <Whirl3d> interesting, I though preventDefault did it as well. Good to know, thanks.
[19:29:42] <rmurphey> Whirl3d: preventDefault really just .. prevents default :)
[19:29:46] <quuxman> Whirl3d: they're separate concepts. That's the whole reason the DOM moved away from return false
[19:29:50] <Whirl3d> what is default then?\
[19:30:00] <quuxman> Whirl3d: what the browser would normally do
[19:30:07] <Whirl3d> which is defined...
[19:30:10] <Whirl3d> where?
[19:30:23] <quuxman> Whirl3d: nowhere specifically of course. This is HTML we're talking about
[19:30:23] <k1ng__> can anyone help me with iframe file uploader?
[19:30:31] <rmurphey> Whirl3d: for example, if you preventDefault on a click on an a, then it will not navigate to its href
[19:30:55] <Whirl3d> but it will propagate the click to it's parent.
[19:30:57] <Whirl3d> Got it
[19:30:58] <rmurphey> http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[19:30:59] <rmurphey> yes
[19:31:17] <k1ng__> someone please help
[19:31:31] <k1ng__> i need to submit a form via iframe
[19:31:41] <Whirl3d> so in stopPropagation, does it just stop based on serial order that the handlers were defined?
[19:31:49] <quuxman> k1ng__: I wrote this in my codebase. It's quite simple
[19:31:54] <rmurphey> Whirl3d: it just stops it from propagating to parent elements
[19:32:16] <rmurphey> so if you have <li><a></a></li>
[19:32:20] <rmurphey> and you have a click handler on the a
[19:32:21] <k1ng__> quuxman, but it is not easy. can you give me the link please?
[19:32:23] <rmurphey> and you stopPropagation
[19:32:28] <quuxman> Whirl3d: the order multiple handlers on a common element are called is completely undefined
[19:32:28] <rmurphey> then the li's click handler will not fire
[19:32:55] <Whirl3d> So it doesn't use the Callbacks() queue
[19:32:59] <rmurphey> (nor any click handlers on ancestors of the li)
[19:33:12] <Whirl3d> but all the direct handlers on a will
[19:33:23] <rmurphey> afaik yes, but i will not swear to it :)
[19:33:37] <rmurphey> definitely a try-it-and-see :)
[19:33:42] <quuxman> k1ng__: let me dig it up
[19:33:49] <k1ng__> thank you
[19:34:01] <Whirl3d> I thought the handlers fired in the order they were assigned. So I wondered if stopProp in the middle would stop to the others. I'll try it in a fiddle and let you know. Thanks for the info
[19:35:23] <rmurphey> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/ZPGTD/
[19:36:04] <rmurphey> better: http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/ZPGTD/1/
[19:37:25] <quuxman> k1ng__: I take that back. It's not really that simple at all
[19:37:28] <quuxman> http://bpaste.net/show/cuax764EbjpwdxPVkIG7/
[19:37:39] <quuxman> k1ng__: that works for me
[19:37:49] <k1ng__> does it work with IE?
[19:38:01] <quuxman> k1ng__: maybe. Haven't tested that. We don't really support IE
[19:38:19] <quuxman> k1ng__: I'd like to know actually
[19:38:44] <quuxman> k1ng__: if you find any IE bugs, and even better, fixes for them, let me know
[19:39:11] <k1ng__> quuxman, i always get Access denied
[19:39:19] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/36Z49/3/
[19:39:21] <Whirl3d> lol
[19:39:38] <quuxman> k1ng__: even with my code?
[19:40:02] <k1ng__> i havent
[19:40:10] <k1ng__> but its will sure give Access Denied
[19:40:21] <quuxman> well try it
[19:40:22] <Whirl3d> rmurphey, it looks like stopPropogation stops the queue based on the order it was assigned
[19:40:24] <k1ng__> because IE require to have mouse click event
[19:40:41] <rmurphey> Whirl3d: i see all 3 click funcions log
[19:40:46] <rmurphey> just not the one on #container
[19:40:52] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/36Z49/3/
[19:41:00] <Whirl3d> only two of them turn red there
[19:41:24] <Whirl3d> nvm
[19:41:29] <Whirl3d> I am so embarrased. LOL
[19:41:51] <rmurphey> oh you spelled it wrong :)
[19:42:06] <Whirl3d> that cracks me up. Gave me just what I wanted though
[19:42:07] <Whirl3d> lol
[19:42:50] <Whirl3d> This should at least go down as a classic example of where TIAS fails without some supervision or at least someone else TIAS at the same time.
[19:42:54] <rmurphey> Whirl3d: i believe stopImmediatePropagation woudl do what you're thinking
[19:43:05] <rmurphey> http://api.jquery.com/event.stopImmediatePropagation/
[19:43:27] <Whirl3d> Hoorah. Thanks.
[19:43:37] <Whirl3d> Works great (no spelling errors either)
[19:44:42] <Whirl3d> ? clickoutside
[19:44:43] <bot-t> Whirl3d, clickoutside - Plugin Repository - jQuery - On click outside of an element executes a callback. It can be attached to multiple elements. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/click-outside
[19:45:25] <Whirl3d> quuxman, not sure if that helps, but it might have some ideas for ya.
[19:46:25] <Whirl3d> is there any graceful way to set a deferred object to resolve once all the other resolved handlers have fired?
[19:46:55] <Whirl3d> I know there's .when(), but can you use .when() with the list of defferreds resolve handlers?
[19:47:56] <azbyin> hi all. how do I find out which element in a select (dropdown combo) is selected?
[19:48:33] <azbyin> $("#myselect").val()   gives me the value
[19:48:51] <azbyin> is it possibel to get/set the select dropdown using an index?
[19:49:49] <Whirl3d> and how bad would it be to extend the deferred object to create an object that you could setup like this: $.Deferred().pending(do stuff).init(dofirstStuff).then(doSuccess, doFail).always(doEverytime);
[19:51:28] <Whirl3d> $("#myselect").find("[selected='selected']")   maybe?
[19:52:34] <quuxman> k1ng__: did my code work?
[19:52:39] <azbyin> Whirl3d, well, that doesn;t give me an index value, but still returns the option element that has been selected
[19:52:51] <Whirl3d> .index()
[19:52:52] <k1ng__> quuxman, i didnt try
[19:53:02] <k1ng__> it yet
[19:53:10] <Whirl3d> $("#myselect").find("[selected='selected']").index()
[19:58:11] <bnm> Is there any difference between $('selector') and $('html').find('selector') ?
[20:00:56] <systemfault> In the end.. no...
[20:01:08] <systemfault> But the second one has a useless step
[20:03:32] <Whirl3d> I would like to extend the deferred object to add a method or two to it and I'm a little confused about the syntax in the source and how to effectively implement any changes to it. http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.Deferred
[20:07:06] <bnm> k, ty systemfault
[20:12:39] <chrisv-nyc> has anyone here extended the ui.menu widget?
[20:13:21] <chrisv-nyc> i'm trying to customize some methods for ui.menu and have a question about even binding
[20:15:39] <bnm> Whirl3d: http://fixee.org/paste/loulu81/
[20:16:16] <bnm> Be aware that it will need to be updated if jQuery.Deferred is updated with any additional parameters
[20:16:22] <bnm> in the future
[20:17:17] <bnm> Also, the new methods won't be available to the JS code that is executed before this snippet, so the order in which the script is loaded does matter
[20:17:26] <bnm> sorry -- the scripts are loaded*
[20:17:42] <bnm> chrisv-nyc: don't ask to ask
[20:19:17] <chrisv-nyc> thanks bnm
[20:19:30] <chrisv-nyc> i need help trying to figure out a line like this:
[20:19:39] <chrisv-nyc> this.element.bind( "click.menu", function( event ) {....
[20:21:17] <chrisv-nyc> my question is about "click.menu"...does that line say * bind this element's click event within then menu namespace and executre function(event){}  ?
[20:21:27] <chrisv-nyc> is that how it would be interpreted?
[20:22:40] <bnm> chrisv-nyc: at http://api.jquery.com/bind/ it says 'eventTypeA string containing one or more DOM event types, such as "click" or "submit," or custom event names.'
[20:22:50] <bnm> but in http://api.jquery.com/category/events/ I can't find any event of the type 'click.menu'.
[20:23:15] <bnm> Thus I guess it's a custom event name -- i.e. unknown to jquery but known to the document author
[20:24:28] <chrisv-nyc> ok, that makes sense. that's what i was thinking as i couldn't find that event definition anywhere, event after looking at everything in firebug
[20:24:37] <chrisv-nyc> thanks for the help
[20:24:54] <bnm> glad to help!
[20:25:30] <bnm> you're welcome
[20:27:58] <bnm> to trigger the event, you may try http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[20:29:03] <Crimlo> my nuts hurt
[20:30:56] <Crimlo> guess no one cares.
[20:31:55] <bnm> guess they would if you rephrased it as a jquery-related question
[20:32:00] <bnm> however don't keep the laptop on the legs
[20:33:16] <bnm> it generates dangerous heat.
[20:33:17] <shoky> Whirl3d whatcha wanna add?
[20:33:31] <shoky> or, which part is confusing you

[20:34:22] <Crimlo> i don't think its from the heat bro, a serious problem with masturbation here.
[20:34:33] <shoky> it shows the "resolve" array as part of the comment 3rd line

[20:34:57] <Soleino^> hello everybody
[20:35:10] <Soleino^> i want to know (plz)
[20:35:23] <Soleino^> what the hell is going with this line if (!$.browser === 'msie' && !parseInt($.browser.version, 10) < 7) { // something }
[20:36:04] <shoky> Soleino^ it's using a deprecated $.browser to test the browser version
[20:36:21] <Soleino^> and what is the solution ?
[20:36:33] <Soleino^> dont talk to me about html tag if ie please
[20:36:44] <shoky> though i dont think it's doing it right
[20:37:06] <shoky> solution to what?
[20:38:41] <bnm> Soleino^ : http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/
[20:39:53] <Whirl3d> sorry, I was getting coffee. bnm, thanks for your reply. I'll have to see if it will do what i want.
[20:40:57] <Crimlo> this channel needs some women or i wont be coming back
[20:41:06] <Whirl3d> shoky!  I find that I keep repeating this idea:    when checking to see if an element is already animating towards a specific "state", I store a deferred object the element's data.
[20:41:13] <tw2113> i'll miss you Crimlo
[20:41:21] <Crimlo> i bet
[20:42:10] <Crimlo> i mean, don't you guys get bored just talking jquery and helping these indians figure stuff out?
[20:42:11] <Whirl3d> then if the deferred exists, it must be animating to that "state", so just add the callback to it or if it doesn't exist, create it and setup the animation sequence.
[20:42:18] <shoky> oh i didn't notice bnm already answered you
[20:42:33] <Whirl3d> So rather than just pending, resolved and failed states, I need an init state.
[20:42:53] <Crimlo> :x
[20:43:11] <Whirl3d> and I would like to be consistent across the deferred api and provide a callback for the pending state like there is for the reject and resole states
[20:44:25] <Whirl3d> so, basically, you could $.Deferred().init(setupCallback).pending(pendingCallback).done(doneCallback).then(success, fail).always(alwaysfunc).final(endfunc)
[20:44:40] <Whirl3d> not that you would ever, but you get the idea
[20:46:29] <shoky> don't really understand what all that is needed for
[20:46:36] <Whirl3d> because then you wouldn't have to check if the deferred exists, you'd just set it up and the init callback would handle it if it didn't, the pending would handle it if it did, resolved and rejected would skip it if it was already done and final would remove it once all resolved and rejected were finished
[20:48:17] <Whirl3d> Still working on an elegant (cough) way to handle animations that are already started when you need to change them For example, in a sequence of 5 animation steps, if you need to stop at third step and go backwards, it gets tricky...
[20:49:22] <shoky> i dunno, all your additions just seem to make it even trickier
[20:50:05] <Whirl3d> one of the nice things that deferred with animation has afforded me is that I can get immediate callbacks on items that are already at a certain animation state. For example, normally you would have to check if an element was :animated and then guess based on it's properties whether it was animating TO or FROM your selected state
[20:52:16] <Whirl3d> Because if you have a complex animation involving 3 items doing different things and you want to get them from a state labeled "featured" where they are all setup one way to a state labeled "stacked" where they are setup another way and then fire a callback and the animation takes 5 seconds. If they are already at the "stacked" state, fire the callback now
[20:53:10] <Whirl3d> rather than try to animate the elements to their existing state over another 5 seconds.
[20:54:56] <codepython777> Whirl3d: Can you help me with the problem you helped me earlier: http://jsfiddle.net/4cHSY/93/ -- There is space on the right side inside the black box if i increase the width a lot. How can I fix that?
[20:58:45] <io__> how can i iterate both over a class like $("myclass").each and over an array at the same time?
[21:00:08] <shoky> io__: the each callback gets the index as first argument
[21:02:31] <Whirl3d> codepython777, try this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/4cHSY/113/   not the most beautiful solution, but it might be what you need.
[21:04:22] <io__> shoky: http://pastebin.com/J1XD0kZ1
[21:05:34] <io__> shoky: i know how to iterate each class or iterate over the array but in this case i need to do both at the same time
[21:06:06] <io__> so for each class element found get the relative data and one of the item from the array
[21:06:59] <digs> The line here: http://jsfiddle.net/Uu4XN/1/ -- ` $(this).find('input').blur(function() { ` -- How do I also include select boxes? Do I have to duplicate everything just for the one select box on the form?
[21:07:52] <bnm> io__: what about { 'className' : arrValue } ?
[21:08:07] <codepython777> Whirl3d: you are setting the width, not the height! ?
[21:08:47] <bnm> io__: sorry, it won't work with the class name... but do the elements have something unique that distinguishes them?
[21:09:26] <Whirl3d> you said: There is space on the right side inside the black box
[21:09:27] <io__> bnm: yes, another class like .views.row-1
[21:10:17] <io__> .views-row-1
[21:10:23] <io__> 2, 3 etc
[21:14:18] <io__> so maybe  i can use that as index...
[21:14:20] <shoky> io__: you have to decide which version of .each you are using
[21:14:22] <shoky> $.each
[21:14:24] <shoky> or $(...).each
[21:14:41] <io__> the one which will work.. :)
[21:14:42] <azbyin> guys, i am doing this in my script  $("#area option:eq(3)").attr('selected', true);   and as expected the selection changes to the 3rd option in the select dropdown
[21:14:43] <shoky> you can't use both simultaneously with  $(selector).each(array, ...)
[21:15:05] <azbyin> but the problem is that it doesn;t trigger the action that happens when the 3rd option is chosen with the mouse interactively
[21:15:07] <azbyin> why is this?
[21:15:08] <shoky> io__ that's why i mentioned the index
[21:15:47] <shoky> io__: $(".views-row").each(function(index,value){  var arrayElement = arrValues[i]; .... })
[21:16:03] <shoky> i mean arrValues[index]
[21:16:35] <bnm> io__ maybe this works? http://pastebin.com/KFgp2c1i
[21:16:36] <Whirl3d> azbyin, so trigger it manually using trigger
[21:16:55] <shoky> wtf
[21:17:08] <tw2113> ftw
[21:17:21] <shoky> bnm why not arrValues[index] ??
[21:17:30] * tw2113 *screams* aghhhhhhhh logic!!!!
[21:17:40] <shoky> also that's still using .each wrong
[21:17:49] <bnm> digs: an option would be to write the function once and pass it to .find('input') and .find(whatever identifies your boxes)
[21:18:07] <bnm> shoky: good point, lol
[21:18:52] <bnm> sorry :p
[21:19:13] <bnm> but sometimes I think too much
[21:19:53] <shoky> outthunk yerself
[21:20:08] <azbyin> $("#area option:eq(5)").attr('selected', true).change();  that triggers it
[21:20:18] <tw2113>  shoky wanna know something that'd really amaze me?
[21:20:27] <azbyin> is that one of the correct ways of doing it?
[21:21:46] <shoky> tw2113 it will amaze you after i know it?
[21:22:33] <tw2113> i was going to say that i'd be amazed if i ever contributed to the actual topic at hand in here
[21:22:47] <shoky> azbyin: that, or calling the handler yourself
[21:23:15] <shoky> tw2113 you seem to do that , usually when i'm away :P
[21:23:24] <tw2113> ok, who ratted me out?
[21:23:37] <shoky> mirc ;S
[21:23:38] <tw2113> *looks around*
[21:24:09] <azbyin> shoky, i don't want to know who is the handler. this will suffice. thanks
[21:24:18] <shoky> lol
[21:26:47] <codepython777> how do i run a function after all images are loaded on the page? Seems like ready is executing before that
[21:27:31] <io__> shoky: http://pastebin.com/bKPMJrXe  4 paths are created but the values are messed up... i tried different options but i am a bit lost now..
[21:27:31] <Whirl3d> ? imagesloaded
[21:28:08] <bnm> what do you mean by 'messed up'?
[21:28:10] <Whirl3d> https://gist.github.com/268257/  <--codepython777
[21:30:17] <io__> bnm the svg format is not as it should be
[21:31:15] <io__> ok i can see in console that value is not an array item but an element
[21:31:50] <azbyin> is there a record and playback plugin for jquery?
[21:32:01] <azbyin> similar to selenium IDE's recording and playback ?
[21:32:54] <azbyin> i want to do the same playback as what selenium ide does, but with only js (without requirement of user to install a browser addon)
[21:33:47] <Whirl3d> Haven't seen selenium
[21:34:01] <codepython777> Whirl3d: thanks
[21:34:15] <bnm> azbyin: I don't  know selenium ide, but AFAIK the alternative to installing a plugin is relying on the browser native support
[21:34:25] <codepython777> azbyin: thats going to be tough, but possible
[21:34:27] <bnm> of the file
[21:35:21] <azbyin> codepython777, the main issue at the moment for me is the recording aspect. and this needs to be done only once for my site
[21:35:38] <azbyin> after which everyone who wants to simply see the "demo" can just do the playback
[21:36:02] <azbyin> bnm, what do you mean by browser native support ?
[21:37:19] <shoky> io__: don't use 'value'
[21:37:33] <shoky> io__: 'value' will contain the current element, same as 'this'
[21:37:48] <shoky> io__: use arrayElement, that's what we put it there for :\
[21:37:56] <bnm> for playing, I mean use a player embedded into the browser. For recording, AFAIK it is not possible
[21:38:02] <bnm> see also http://bytes.com/topic/javascript/answers/153385-recording-sound-files-javascript
[21:38:22] <io__> shoky: yes i was there already, slowly ...
[21:38:23] <io__> tx
[21:38:45] <shoky> ah right you said it
[21:38:45] <bnm> 'player embedded into the browser' I mean example: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fetal_yawning_4D_ultrasound_ecografia_4D_Dr._Wolfgang_Moroder.theora.ogv
[21:38:54] <azbyin> bnm, no need for player
[21:39:05] <azbyin> my demo will be "live" i.e. will use the site
[21:39:09] <bnm> click the play icon, then more, then see 'native support' and other options
[21:39:15] <bnm> aaah ok
[21:39:29] <azbyin> i.e. i can change themes/layouts/colours, etc. and the demo still works fine as long as i haven;t messed up the structure/ids/etc.
[21:43:23] <azbyin> anyway, i already have a live demo working for a small selection of elements. just need to add more functionality: eg actually showing/opening select dropdowns, adding support for text input in forms/textareas, deciding whether page needs to be scrolled to a particular element, etc.
[21:50:16] <codepython777> Whirl3d: http://pbin.be/show/662/ -- how can i simplify this code? It seems to work for my html.
[21:50:50] <codepython777> this 26.66 is coming form some kind of margin/padding, but i cant figure it out. I have both columns with the same style. One has an image, the other text
[21:51:21] <codepython777> There must be a way to write a function once and then call it again from both these functions?
[21:52:09] <bnm> function functionName() { ... function body ... }
[21:52:25] <bnm> $(window).resize(functionName);
[21:52:29] <codepython777> bnm: and this function can do var col1 = $("#dcolumn1"); ?
[21:53:02] <bnm> is that in the function body?
[21:53:15] <bnm> in the functions* body
[21:53:31] <bnm> in the functions'* bodies*
[21:53:47] <codepython777> yes
[21:54:01] <azbyin> codepython777, why do you think it cannot do   var col1 = $("#dcolumn1") ?
[21:54:08] <shoky> codepython777: you don't need to call $('#dcolumn1') so many times
[21:54:09] <azbyin> you can do that anywhere in your script
[21:54:10] <shoky> once will do
[21:54:22] <shoky> and then just use col1 and col2 ..
[21:54:26] <bnm> It is outside of window.resize and $('logo').load
[21:54:28] <codepython777> like this -- http://pbin.be/show/663/
[21:54:59] <bnm> right, now pass equate_resize to $('logo').load
[21:55:57] <bnm> equate_height* (wtf -.-'')
[21:56:34] <codepython777> something went wrong -- http://pbin.be/show/664/
[21:57:01] <shoky> codepython777: http://pbin.be/show/665/
[21:57:26] <Chel> question: how to split long lines of html tags in $.append(' ?
[21:57:32] <codepython777> shoky: thanks
[21:57:45] <codepython777> bnm: Sorry. I understand your frustration.
[21:58:28] <bnm> Never mind, it's not you, it's that I had to go to sleep a few hours ago
[21:58:34] <tash> if my id is "remove[1]" how can I get just the digit 1 out of there?
[21:58:41] <azbyin> codepython777, would be better if you showed us the page or a testcase on jsfiddle
[21:58:43] <codepython777> shoky: its not equivalent
[21:58:52] <codepython777> the heights now are different! ?
[21:59:10] <azbyin> sounds like you might not even need this 26.66 and forced height adjusting
[21:59:14] <shoky> maybe because now things are actually being called? :)
[21:59:51] <codepython777> azbyin: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/4cHSY/113/
[22:00:03] <bnm> chel: one piece per variable
[22:00:08] <codepython777> azbyin: I was trying to use this solution and pull it inside my project
[22:00:16] <Chel> bnm: yep
[22:00:16] <bnm> then pass append the variables concatenated through +
[22:01:30] <bnm> tash: if all id's are of the form remove[x] where x is a digit, then it should work:  /remove\[\d+\]/.test("remove[1]")
[22:01:58] <shoky> he wanted to extract the digit ;p
[22:02:10] <codepython777> shoky: its the use of var col1 and col2
[22:02:11] <bnm> ooh
[22:02:17] <codepython777> shoky: $("#dcolumn2").height($("#dcolumn1").height()+26.66); works! ?
[22:02:27] <bnm> mm, so he'll need a capturing group I guess, just a minute
[22:02:41] <shoky> codepython777: are those column elements not in the DOM tree on page load ?
[22:03:26] <codepython777> no idea. I do have them in simple divs in the html
[22:03:49] <shoky> then that's weird
[22:04:27] <bnm> tash:     (/remove\[(\d+)\]/g).exec("remove[1]")[1]     will return the digit/s
[22:09:31] <bnm> notice that the [1] at the end is not related to the [1] in the string - it will also work for "remove[2]" etc..
[22:10:25] <tash> if var = 'ab' and I want to get 'a' only, shouldn't this work? var = var.substr( 0, 1);
[22:10:59] <lng> hi! I can do this to get value - $('select[name="UserName"]'), but how do I get value from this?
[22:11:03] <lng> 'this'
[22:11:16] <bnm> var is a keyword
[22:11:28] <lng> 'this' contains the whole form
[22:12:25] <bnm> lng: try .attr('name')
[22:12:27] <bnm> documentation at
[22:12:27] <Chel> bnm: can you show how to improve and how to split https://gist.github.com/a4c0c5ee66f827966d75 this
[22:12:29] <bnm> http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[22:12:43] <Chel> please help
[22:13:08] <lng> bnm: why attr? there are child elements
[22:13:36] <bnm> lng: attribute of the select, don't you want to get the username?
[22:14:17] <lng> bnm: sorry, I was not very clear
[22:14:39] <lng> 1. $('form').submit(function() {...}
[22:15:06] <lng> 2. Now I need to AJAX all the data
[22:15:35] <lng> and do some data refrmatting also
[22:15:39] <lng> reformatting
[22:16:43] <tash> how can I get my digit 1 out of this? http://pastebin.com/UXH3dAke
[22:16:47] <tash> I'm sure it's very easy
[22:19:35] <tash> when I try to use substr or substring I keeping getting id.substring is not a function ... or id.substr is not a function
[22:22:29] <tash> n/m
[22:22:34] <tash> I just wasn't thinking
[22:22:40] <bnm> chel: for example http://pbin.be/show/666/ (there was also a </tr without the > and a missing </div>)
[22:23:20] <Chel> bnm thank you
[22:23:42] <Chel> i've never knew that + can followed by new line
[22:24:16] <bnm> Not only +. All Javascript statements can span multiple lines
[22:24:59] <lng> how do I search within 'this'?
[22:25:31] <Chel> but in javascript new line is end of statement
[22:25:41] <lng> $('#Login').submit(function() { Env      = $('#Login input[name="Env"]:checked').val();
[22:26:00] <lng> I know I can use 'this' inside of func
[22:26:18] <bnm> Try $(this)
[22:26:29] <lng> end then?
[22:26:31] <bnm> maybe?
[22:26:32] <lng> bnm: ^
[22:27:00] <lng> how to rewrite $('#Login input[name="Env"]:checked').val()?
[22:27:42] <lng> $(this).$('input[name="Env"]:checked').val()
[22:27:48] <lng> need something like that
[22:29:38] <bnm> maybe   $(this).children('input[name="Env"]:checked')   ?
[22:30:32] <bnm> lng: ^
[22:30:46] <lng> thanks!
[22:30:58] <bnm> You're welcome.
[22:48:30] <subhojit777> I have stored a jquery object in a variable like this: ​var $current = $('ul'); Now I want to get its first child li element. I have tried using this document.write($current.children('li:first-child'));​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ But it returns all the li child elements
[22:55:21] <scr3am> subhojit777: only first  i think
[22:56:24] <subhojit777> scr3am: here http://jsfiddle.net/4pyMX/ see this
[22:58:03] <malikmasr> does anyone have experience with fancybox 2?
[22:58:37] <malikmasr> im having trouble getting a hyperlink inside the fancybox to work properly
[22:58:47] <malikmasr> the box just flashes on me and nothing happens
[22:59:44] <malikmasr> fades out slightly then back in
[22:59:49] <malikmasr> instead of opening the link
[23:01:04] <scr3am> subhojit777: console.log($current.children('li:first'));
[23:04:12] <subhojit777> scr3am: and now it says "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'children' of null" in the browser log
[23:05:22] <scr3am> you need to change to jquery lib, not mootools
[23:06:25] <subhojit777> scr3am: I have also seen this link https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/jquery-en/TM6qunHtePw which has exactly the same problem
[23:06:58] <scr3am> subhojit777: you need to change to jquery lib, not mootools !!!
[23:08:03] <subhojit777> ohh thanks :) significant change in output
[23:09:23] <scr3am> subhojit777: so you can answer in the google-group ;-)
[23:10:15] <subhojit777> scr3am: one more thing, is it dependent on any specific jQuery version? Like the code won't work below jQuery 1.4.4
[23:10:21] <subhojit777> sure I will do it
[23:11:52] <scr3am> depends, no use the latest and the greatest
[23:13:24] <subhojit777> scr3am: ok thanks again

[23:33:14] <jarco> Hello people, while trying to implement jquery in a way that doesn't conflict with other scripts i get the "jquery is not defined" error. I have googled this and it seems to be often happening with jquery.noconflict(). But I am not using that. Any ideas why i get this error? http://www.mobes.be
[23:34:57] <shoky> jarco: its jQuery
[23:35:20] <jarco> omg, how could I have missed that
[23:35:34] <shoky> silly-ly ;p
[23:35:42] <tw2113> I Can't Believe It's Not jQuery
[23:36:17] <shoky> man i wish there was a bacon delivery site.
[23:36:19] <jarco> This took me 4hours of searching
[23:36:21] <motmot> (jQuery);
[23:36:26] <motmot> wow sorry
[23:36:30] <motmot> > go back to sleep
[23:36:44] * jarco feels like an idiot
[23:37:05] * tw2113 feels jarco 
[23:37:07] <tw2113> you feel human to me
[23:37:13] <shoky> hmm hmm bacon hmmmm
[23:37:15] <coldhead> as long as you got there in the end!
[23:37:53] <jarco> My colleague is laughing so hard now.
[23:38:55] <shoky> it's 9:30am. i haven't slept yet. i am considering going to get some back and fry it up and drown my sorrows in it
[23:38:59] <shoky> yep/nope?
[23:39:07] <shoky> er
[23:39:09] <shoky> back=bacon
[23:39:34] <tw2113> set up a cot under your desk
[23:39:47] <shoky> buttt i want bacon
[23:39:58] <shoky> 1 min drive to the shop
[23:40:01] <tw2113> so set up a bacon under your desk too
[23:40:09] <shoky> ohhh
[23:41:16] <Zhy> wrap yourself in bacon and get some fitful, tasty sleep
[23:41:25] <Zhy> options combined, problem solved :0
[23:41:29] <shoky> i'll go dream bout that. gnight
[23:41:36] <Zhy> gn8 shoky
[23:42:18] <coldhead> g9t
[23:43:47] <lng> why does it return the same value disregarding the item was checked? $('input[name="Env"]').val()
[23:44:18] <coldhead> $('input[name="Env"]:checked').val()
[23:44:25] <Cork> lng: cause .val returns the value attribute
[23:44:27] <lng> I see, I need :checked
[23:44:28] <Cork> not checked
[23:44:30] <lng> yesa
[23:44:33] <lng> yea
[23:44:34] <lng> thanks
[23:44:34] <Cork> or .is(':checked')
[23:44:45] <Cork> or .prop('checked')
[23:44:53] <lng> nice
[23:44:58] <Cork> i would recommend the last one
[23:45:17] <Cork> $('input[name="Env"]').prop('checked')
[23:45:18] <lng> $('input[name="Env"]').prop().val()?
[23:45:22] <lng> ah
[23:46:00] <Cork> it returns true or false
[23:46:02] <lng> not working
[23:46:16] <Cork> what version of jquery?
[23:47:30] <lng> mmt
[23:47:52] <lng> ah, it's bool
[23:48:00] <lng> nm
[23:55:10] <dirkpennings> does someone have a 1.2.5 jquery.tools tabs and tabs.slideshow as separate js files?
