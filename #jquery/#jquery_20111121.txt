[00:03:51] <tdignan> JSON.parse is choking on some invalid character
[00:03:59] <tdignan> is there some sort of powertool I can use to fix this?
[00:04:09] <tdignan> because I cannot locate the character that is causing the problem.
[00:04:16] <tdignan> (easily, over 20k chars)
[00:09:50] <bobdobbs> I want to run a function after a plugin has been loaded. The plugin has no option for a callback. How do I assure that my function runs after the plugin?
[00:10:33] <Cork> bobdobbs: script tags in the head is read async
[00:10:38] <Cork> sorry
[00:10:41] <Cork> its read sync
[00:10:48] <Cork> so just put it after
[00:10:54] <bobdobbs> hm...
[00:11:09] <beasty_> morning
[00:11:24] <Cork> (unless it makes some fancy async require things)
[00:11:57] <bobdobbs> I tried that, but I didn't get the expected result. I guess that this happens because both the plugin and my function are run when the document is ready.
[00:12:32] <bobdobbs> I'm guessing that there must be some scripty way to do: "run this first, and then afterwards, do the other thing"
[00:12:45] <bobdobbs> I think I might have even done it before, but I can't remember how.
[00:18:05] <tdignan> Does anyone know of a good psychiatrist?
[00:19:11] <bobdobbs> tdignan: emacs has one built in.
[00:21:02] <tdignan> i wonder why.. it's not like a psychiatrist will help you with carpal tunnel
[00:21:14] <bobdobbs> true
[00:21:17] <tdignan> :D
[00:21:32] <tdignan> JS is hard to debug
[00:21:49] <bobdobbs> but she will help you with the mental problems that result from carpal tunnel
[00:21:56] <tdignan> but that is good, I was feeling very unchallenged
[00:22:17] <tdignan> guitar gave me bad arthritis after a few weeks of heavy practice
[00:22:19] <tdignan> then it went away
[00:22:27] <tdignan> the computer is nothing
[00:42:55] <jY> is there a way to tell if a div has been shown?
[00:43:48] <bobdobbs> jY: what are you testing for? A css property? display? visibility?
[00:44:26] <jY> bobdobbs: well i guess to see if a div by a certain class name has been created
[00:46:34] <beasty_> anyone using jquery.uniform with ipad ?
[00:46:59] <beasty_> i have this issues with the buttons not showing up correctly
[00:48:14] <Cork> ?:visible @ jY
[00:48:14] <bot-t> jY, :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[00:49:01] <Cork> jY: if its been created is just a simple $('div.class-name').length > 0
[00:49:56] <jY> Cork: is there an event in jquery that i can listen to though for dom creation?
[00:50:12] <jY> cause i'm looking to see when a popover is loaded
[00:50:30] <Cork> jY: only in browsers that produce it, and those events isn't cross browser yet
[00:50:47] <jY> nuts
[00:51:08] <Cork> simplest is to wrap the function that adds the element
[00:51:36] <jY> i'll just edit the plugin i guess
[00:51:48] <Cork> yuck
[00:51:59] <Cork> jY: extend it instead
[00:52:14] <Cork> less work when its done to upgrade
[00:52:23] <Cork> s/done/time/
[00:52:29] <jY> ok i'll read up on how to do that
[00:52:43] <Cork> is it a normal jquery plugin?
[00:52:53] <Cork> or jquery-ui or what?
[00:52:56] <jY> it's the twitter bootstrap js
[00:53:07] <Cork> ouch
[00:53:14] <Cork> then it might be a bit complicated
[00:53:20] <jY> https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/js/bootstrap-twipsy.js
[00:53:22] <jY> ya
[00:53:35] <jY> err https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/js/bootstrap-popover.js
[00:53:40] <jY> that one
[00:53:40] <Cork> whats the div your looking for?
[00:54:06] <jY> popover
[00:54:28] <jY> creates the dom at line 64
[00:54:33] <Cork> then it should be doable
[00:57:18] <Cork> jY: http://jsfiddle.net/
[00:57:20] <Cork> bah..
[00:57:26] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/
[00:57:32] * Cork hits jsfiddle...
[00:57:37] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/GLjqY/
[00:57:48] <Cork> copy the link when i say so... >_<
[00:58:08] <Trisox> hello any one worked with jquery mobile before
[00:58:11] <jY> ahhh
[00:58:18] <jY> Cork: many thanks
[00:58:30] <Cork> np
[00:58:50] <Cork> jY: just rememberd one thing, its apply, not call
[00:59:39] <Cork> jY: corrected one http://jsfiddle.net/GLjqY/1/
[00:59:42] <jY> cork: so i would add this to my JS where load the plugin like $("[rel=popover]").popover(); ?
[01:00:06] <Cork> jY: no this extends the entire class
[01:00:12] <jY> ok
[01:00:17] <Cork> so you add it after you require the lib
[01:00:23] <jY> gotcha
[01:00:26] <jY> thanks
[01:00:29] <Cork> np
[01:04:51] <MariusKarthaus> Hi I'm trying to get a theme selector widget (http://jqueryui.com/docs/Theming/ThemeSwitcher)  in my webapp but the code on the ui website depends on http://jqueryui.com/themes/base/ui.all.css but it fails to load this. Plus I need https. Does anyone know if this can be done using google CDN and where to link to ?
[01:04:52] <Flynsarmy> doing an alert( $.datepicker.regional["en-AU"] ); is returning undefined? any ideas? i'm using jquery 1.7 and ui 1.8.16 off google CDN
[01:06:07] <pi3r> hi all
[01:06:26] <pi3r> how can i get all the options with null value from a select?
[01:06:34] <pi3r> do there is any handy selector?
[01:18:36] <xec> pi3r: you mean the markup is value=""? you can do something like $('[value=""]')
[01:18:42] <Trisox> question when i press submit i want to use data-transition="slide" any way how to do this?
[01:18:43] <s3d_matt> hi all
[01:18:50] <Trisox> in jquery mobile
[01:19:10] <pi3r> xec, yep something like that, but i need to be able to specify the select
[01:19:22] <s3d_matt> Just doing a find in query on AJAX success.   Want to find all form elements, and apply some css to the ID of that form element
[01:19:33] <s3d_matt> is this a valid method? $('.".$formSelector."').find('input').id.css('color','red');
[01:19:39] <xec> pi3r: $('select[value=""]')
[01:19:41] <pi3r> xec, like $('select#id option[value=""]')
[01:19:47] <xec> right
[01:19:52] <s3d_matt> $formSelector is a PHP var
[01:19:52] <xec> ignore mine
[01:20:01] <pi3r> xec, but it does not work
[01:20:20] <xec> ?demo @ pi3r
[01:20:21] <bot-t> pi3r, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[01:21:27] <xec> s3d_matt: what is the .id doing there?
[01:21:46] <s3d_matt> xec: as I would like to apply the css styles to the ID of the element found
[01:22:13] <aaronmcadam> you don't need the select part
[01:22:16] <xec> s3d_matt: .css() applies css directly
[01:22:35] <aaronmcadam> you should be using add/removeClass
[01:22:43] <s3d_matt> so do i need to do, $('.".$formSelector."').find('input') and then loop through those found results?
[01:22:44] <xec> s3d_matt: like inline style=""
[01:22:47] <aaronmcadam> css adds style rules
[01:22:55] <aaronmcadam> attr*
[01:22:57] <s3d_matt> xec: ahh i see
[01:23:14] <s3d_matt> xec: any ideas how i could loop through and apply to the ID?
[01:23:57] <xec> s3d_matt: you can't edit the style sheet that easily afaik, but like aaronmcadam suggested, you can add a classname
[01:24:00] <pi3r> xec, http://jsfiddle.net/6Y7dc/
[01:24:12] <pi3r> xec i want to be able to specify the select
[01:24:19] <s3d_matt> xec: good point.  That would work
[01:24:36] <pi3r> xec, and get the empty value content as a result
[01:24:50] <MariusKarthaus> I need a https CDN alternative for this http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/themeswitchertool/
[01:25:11] <aaronmcadam> what happens when u whack https in front
[01:25:16] <s3d_matt> xec: thanks
[01:25:28] <xec> pi3r: jsfiddle.net/6Y7dc/1/
[01:26:13] <xec> pi3r: or jsfiddle.net/6Y7dc/2/
[01:26:36] <pi3r> xec, Oo thanks man
[01:26:45] <pi3r> xec, i was totally missing the '>'
[01:26:56] <xec> the > is not essential
[01:27:06] <aaronmcadam> don't use ancestor selectors
[01:27:13] <xec> i'm guessing you're not nesting selects :P
[01:27:16] <aaronmcadam> they're very inefficient if u don't *need* them
[01:27:28] <aaronmcadam> bad xec, bad xec :p
[01:27:35] <xec> why are they bad?
[01:27:38] <aaronmcadam> right
[01:27:50] <aaronmcadam> jQuery selectors, like CSS selectors, are parsed right to left
[01:27:59] <aaronmcadam> so 'div > .class'
[01:28:00] <aaronmcadam> means
[01:28:08] <s3d_matt> xec: $('.".$formSelector."').find('input') - can that be made to find other form elements (e.g. select, text area etc) all in one command?
[01:28:12] <aaronmcadam> "check the document for a class called 'class'"
[01:28:22] <aaronmcadam> and now check that it's a direct descendant of any div
[01:28:55] <xec> aaronmcadam: and?
[01:29:06] <aaronmcadam> that;s very bad
[01:29:24] <aaronmcadam> http://addyosmani.com/jqprovenperformance/
[01:29:26] <xec> aaronmcadam: how does this apply to this case, we need the id anyway
[01:29:39] <aaronmcadam> just don't use > if u don't need it
[01:30:05] <aaronmcadam> options will always be direct descendants of selects
[01:30:21] <aaronmcadam> apart from your nested case
[01:30:44] <xec> yes, but this way we won't mismatch if the id is misused elsewhere
[01:30:48] <aaronmcadam> ha
[01:30:55] <aaronmcadam> the id shouldn't be anyway
[01:31:13] <aaronmcadam> writing code in case something is misused is crazy
[01:31:35] <aaronmcadam> and how would u
[01:31:40] <xec> thats right, it's an edge case for sure, i just dont think the performance would be affected very much, if at all
[01:31:41] <aaronmcadam> jquery will only pick the first id
[01:31:44] <pi3r> xec, aaronmcadam if something like that goot $('option[value=""]', $('select#id')) (it's working)
[01:32:01] <pi3r>  /s/if/is
[01:32:01] <aaronmcadam> drop the select
[01:32:06] <aaronmcadam> and do it this way
[01:32:16] <pi3r> aaronmcadam, but i need to pass it as a variable
[01:32:17] <aaronmcadam> $('#id').find('option[val..)
[01:32:24] <pi3r> ah ok
[01:32:35] <aaronmcadam> that's what it does under the hood anyway
[01:32:48] <aaronmcadam> passing context to a selector uses .find()
[01:32:59] <pi3r> ok
[01:33:02] <pi3r> that's working
[01:33:05] <aaronmcadam> cool
[01:33:21] <pi3r> thanks a lot xec aaronmcadam
[01:33:24] <aaronmcadam> np
[01:38:34] <poppiez> I'm using this code to make sure images have loaded: http://pastie.org/private/eikemdrioqtfkwohouqz1q. however, it seems like using a single image object (this.dummy) causes some trouble. after loading a random image, all future images are true for this.complete. any way to make this work as expected (treat each new src as a new image)?
[01:38:36] <Logitec> Hello, is it possible to load javascript in a site.master page and let it execute at all pages? It doesn't seem to work for me
[01:38:56] <aaronmcadam> sure is
[01:39:09] <aaronmcadam> you sure you're using doc.ready
[01:39:25] <Logitec> aaronmcadam: im using body.onload
[01:39:32] <aaronmcadam> ok..
[01:39:40] <aaronmcadam> inline?
[01:39:43] <Logitec> I need to dynamically add items to the navigation bar, depending on cookie values
[01:40:14] <aaronmcadam> how does that work without js?
[01:40:40] <Logitec> im going to do it with js but its not doing anything, not even alerts work
[01:40:43] <Logitec> no errors are displayed either
[01:41:19] <aaronmcadam> what does firebug say
[01:42:02] <Logitec> nothing at all, the code is there, no errors, its just not being executed
[01:42:13] <Logitec>       <script type="text/javascript">           document.body.onload = function () {               alert('test');           };     </script>
[01:42:50] <aaronmcadam> Logitec: jsfiddle plz
[01:45:07] <recentlydeceased> Hey folks, jquery noob here.  I have a dropdown selector, with a bunch of items in.  I can get jquery to only show ONLY specific item id's fine, but how do I get it to show all items, but AUTOSELECT a specific item?
[01:45:14] <recentlydeceased> Any help would be much appreciated!
[01:45:33] <Logitec> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/GnAeZ/
[01:46:29] <Cork> recentlydeceased: $('select option').show();$('select').val(10);
[01:46:52] <recentlydeceased> Cork, thanks I'll give it a try ;)
[01:47:13] <Cork> .val will select the row with that value
[01:47:18] <Logitec> the site.master-page shouldnt be the problem right?
[01:47:19] <Cork> i it exists
[01:47:37] <recentlydeceased> ok
[01:49:03] <recentlydeceased> Cork, that worked.  Thank you!
[01:49:54] <Logitec> Something is interfering, can I have multiple document.body.onloads in a page?
[01:50:15] <Logitec> I already have another onload on some pages, I'm guessing its now randomly executing one or the other
[01:54:37] <Logitec> I'm absolutely sure multiple onloads are the problem
[01:54:57] <Logitec> Is there a way to bypass this issue?
[01:55:22] <Logitec> Inherited javascript with the onload doesn't work
[01:56:04] <Cork> Logitec: it does
[01:56:22] <Cork> i use it from time to time
[01:56:44] <Logitec> Cork: Alright, then there might be a different problem, it seems to randomly execute the one or the other.
[01:57:11] <Logitec> Sometimes it displays the site.master-alert, sometimes the actual.page-alert
[01:57:20] <recentlydeceased> Cork, Ok, spoke too soon,  It works sort of.  It changes the value of multiple selects at once.  I only want it to change one selector.
[01:58:21] <Cork> recentlydeceased: ya, it only works for single selectors
[01:58:28] <Trisox> jquery mobile question when i press submit i want to use data-transition="slide" any way how to do this?
[01:58:47] <recentlydeceased> Is there a way to limit it to a specific selector?
[01:59:02] <Cork> recentlydeceased: you would have to use the options parameter
[01:59:17] <Cork> $('select')[0].options
[01:59:32] <Cork> opps wrong
[01:59:41] * Cork looks for the select array...
[02:01:33] <Cork> gah i don't remember.. -_-
[02:01:52] <Cork> been way to long since i fiddle with multiselecs
[02:02:53] <recentlydeceased> Cork, ok thanks anyway! :)
[02:04:44] <Trisox> cork you got any idea's?
[02:04:47] <Trisox> on jquery mobile?
[02:09:53] <recentlydeceased> Cork, could you limit it to a specific select id?
[02:09:56] <Cork> Trisox: no sorry
[02:10:02] <Trisox> :( k
[02:10:04] <Trisox> \thnx any way\
[02:10:16] <Cork> recentlydeceased: you mean not affect multible select boxes
[02:10:25] <recentlydeceased> Cork, yeah
[02:10:32] <Cork> sure, my code wasn't meant to be used straght of...
[02:10:46] <recentlydeceased> How do I do that then?
[02:10:50] <Cork> 'select' should be your id or select.class-name
[02:11:12] <Cork> in both cases
[02:11:31] <AzMoo> Hi guys. I'm having serious trouble getting any kind of width() for an inline or floated element in webkit. It works if I explicitly set a width in the css, but if not it returns 0. Anybody got a workaround for that?
[02:12:02] <VictorCL> how can I pass to a function the parent element I am calling it from?  like  <td><a href='#' onclick='add(this.parent())'>Add</a></td>   .. something like that?
[02:12:13] <beasty_> i'm pondering if i can run a command each time location.hash is called
[02:12:22] <recentlydeceased> Cork, ok thanks again!
[02:12:23] <Cork> VictorCL: don't use inline events
[02:12:53] <VictorCL> how is that?
[02:13:02] <Saiko> how do you create a clickable offset?
[02:13:21] <Cork> VictorCL: cause its slow, messy and really, really easy to lose track of
[02:13:38] <Cork> VictorCL: and its also an old implementation that doens't handle multible handels
[02:13:49] <VictorCL> and how should I do it?
[02:13:59] <Cork> through event listners
[02:13:59] <recentlydeceased> Cork, man, you have shown me the way.  beer++
[02:14:16] <Cork> VictorCL: see ?.bind and see ?.live and see ?.delegate
[02:14:17] <bot-t> VictorCL, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[02:14:18] <bot-t> VictorCL, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[02:14:18] <bot-t> VictorCL, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[02:14:50] <VictorCL> ok I will read about it
[02:15:31] <Cork> recentlydeceased: heh i missunderstood what you wanted to do for a while :D
[02:15:42] <recentlydeceased> no sweat!
[02:15:44] <Cork> recentlydeceased: so sorry for the mixup, and glad it worked out
[02:15:52] <recentlydeceased> thnx
[02:15:56] <recentlydeceased> legend!
[02:19:54] <Thumper123> Hey, is there a JQuery function to replace an image on mouseover?
[02:20:13] <poppiez> I'm using this code to make sure images have loaded: http://pastie.org/private/eikemdrioqtfkwohouqz1q. however, it seems like using a single image object (this.dummy) causes some trouble. after loading a random image, all future images are true for this.complete. any way to make this work as expected (treat each new src as a new image)?
[02:27:24] <seutje> ?g jquery imagesloaded @ poppiez
[02:27:26] <bot-t> poppiez, jQuery imagesLoaded - http://desandro.github.com/imagesloaded/
[02:34:58] <VictorCL> fuck 3 month without using jquery and I forgot everything xD
[02:37:09] <VictorCL> what is faster    ..  $("td:eq(2)",$tr).tex()  .. or  $tr.children().eq(1).text()
[02:38:13] <Logitec> What's the selector for: <ul id="navbar"> ?
[02:38:32] <Anime> #navbar, ul#navbar
[02:38:33] <Anime> either
[02:38:34] <Logitec> $('#navbar')  doesnt work, i tried a lot of different things
[02:38:46] <Logitec> i tried that as well, it didnt seem to do anything
[02:38:57] <Anime> weird
[02:39:10] <Anime> im a beginner, can't help you beyond that
[02:39:13] <Cork> Logitec: check so you don't have id="navbar" multible times
[02:39:17] <Cork> in the page
[02:40:02] <Cork> VictorCL: theres no difference
[02:40:15] <Cork> VictorCL: all will grep all, and then reduce the results
[02:40:34] <VictorCL> ok thankz
[02:40:38] <Cork> oh wait
[02:40:50] <Cork> $tr.children() is beter
[02:40:55] <Cork> cause it uses a dom function
[02:41:29] * Cork hates linebreaks when they end up in the wrong place...
[02:43:36] <Logitec> alright it is working, seems i still have interferring document.body.onloads, it's only executed sometimes
[02:43:51] <VictorCL> yeah that's what I though
[02:44:23] <Cork> ouch
[02:44:43] <Logitec> its very strange, normal loads wont execute this page-specific onload
[02:44:57] <Cork> VictorCL: ya as they will overwrite each other
[02:44:59] <Logitec> but when i click the href quickly, a few times a second, it will execute randomly
[02:45:09] <Cork> VictorCL: you can only have one of them at a time
[02:45:10] <Logitec> what on earth is going on?
[02:45:57] <Cork> Logitec: try reproduce it minimalisikly on jsfiddle
[02:46:13] <Cork> *minimalistikly
[02:46:33] <troubleman> Hello!
[02:47:19] <seutje> minimalistically* :P
[02:48:05] <troubleman> http://fashiontheme.myshopify.com/ uses the jQuery UI Slider - how exactly do I disable its style though, i.e. make it return to the default look of ones OS?
[02:48:07] <Logitec> Cork: it seems impossible, it cant redirect to itself
[02:48:24] <troubleman> (a lot of people don't "get it")
[02:48:34] <Cork> Logitec: sure it can
[02:48:46] <Cork> Logitec: you need to use the raw mode though
[02:49:43] <Logitec> Cork: how does that work?
[02:50:06] <Cork> Logitec: you check the embed link at the top right of the page
[02:50:20] <Cork> troubleman: it can't get a "native" feel as its not a native element
[02:50:33] <Cork> troubleman: its just spans and divs

[02:51:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, I'm trying to execute some jquery before the dom is loaded, but it's not working... when I remove the jquery document ready line, the jquery that follows does not get executed
[02:52:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> how to make jquery code execute in real time before the dom is fully loaded?
[02:52:32] <Logitec> Cork: it works on jsfiddle, but thats because the interferring thing isnt there, i dont know whats interferring with it
[02:52:49] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: you rarly want to do that, as the page is highly unstable
[02:53:07] <Logitec> http://jsfiddle.net/GnAeZ/
[02:53:20] <Cork> Logitec: you have a link to where the problem is visible?
[02:53:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> well i'm doing a jquery carousel and the pictures just show vertically and only after the dom is loaded, the images get placed in a carousel
[02:53:46] <Logitec> afraid not, local testing only..
[02:54:04] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: you want to do something like preloading or what?
[02:54:21] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yeah i guess
[02:54:24] <Logitec> Cork: Sounds like a strange problem though right? randomly executing code when loaded many times in a short amount of time
[02:54:48] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: theres a plugin that could help you with that
[02:55:02] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: or write it in native js, its farly straght forward
[02:55:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok, i'll have a look for that plugin
[02:55:32] <Cork> Logitec: not really, its farly common for code to behave strange when things kolide
[02:55:43] <Cork> Logitec: try w3c validate and jslint
[02:58:01] <Logitec> Cork: Ill have a look, thanks
[03:01:21] <Remdul> Howdy!
[03:02:59] <Oggu> I am having problems with the jQuery valdiation plugin and IE7. I get   Unspecified error. jquery.min.js, line 3 character 13562. jQUery 1.6.3. Any ideas?
[03:03:40] <troubleman> Cork: i see i see...
[03:05:08] <Remdul> I was hoping someone could point me to where I could find a tutorial on a specific issue, if they had a moment?
[03:06:00] <Thumper123> For some reason "var pos = str.IndexOf("_selected");" is cras
[03:06:07] <Thumper123> *craching my code, any ideas?
[03:06:32] <Thumper123> Any code I write after it is not executed
[03:07:09] <partydroid> you need a starting pos for indexof?
[03:07:20] <partydroid> str.IndexOf("_selected",0)
[03:07:38] <Thumper123> Will try that, thanks
[03:08:18] <SaadIbrahim> http://snpr.cm/Y2JDoT.jpg - can anyone recommend a tooltip plugin that i can easily style to look like this
[03:08:37] <SaadIbrahim> actually how hard would it be to code one from scratch.. i.e a tooltip plugin
[03:09:18] <tdignan> i'd use the qtip plugin
[03:09:25] <tdignan> coding one from scratch would be a pain
[03:09:53] <SaadIbrahim> actually i tried using qtip... seemed complicated to style the way i want it...
[03:10:07] <Remdul> I'm wanting to design an image slider that pulls pictures from a MySQL database as opposed to from the html code. Does anyone know a tutorial or example I can use to learn how to do this?
[03:10:44] <SaadIbrahim> as in loading images dynamically using ajax
[03:10:59] <Remdul> Correct.
[03:11:06] <SaadIbrahim> many image slider plugins have that functionaility already
[03:11:26] <Remdul> Ah... guess I haven't been searching for the right wording, then.
[03:11:38] <SaadIbrahim> gimme a second
[03:11:43] <SaadIbrahim> let me try and find one for you
[03:11:54] <Remdul> Thank you! I greatly appreciate the help.
[03:13:07] <shesek> Remdul, you would usually produce dynamic HTML based on the data that comes from the database
[03:13:24] <SaadIbrahim> o i guess i have confused this with something else
[03:13:26] <shesek> that also makes the images accessible to users with JavaScript turned off and for bots
[03:13:29] <SaadIbrahim> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4495407/jquery-slider-with-ajax-content-loading
[03:13:37] <Thumper123> "var pos = str.IndexOf("_selected", 0)", is still crashing :/
[03:13:51] <shesek> and its also possible to make it degrade gracefully, as opposed to loading it with AJAX
[03:14:11] <shesek> Thumper123, "crashing"?
[03:14:16] <shesek> what do you mean by that?
[03:14:18] <Remdul> Ah, alright... Hmm...
[03:14:30] <Thumper123> Any code I put after that line is not executing
[03:14:56] <shesek> Thumper123, that can't be the cause. Can you reproduce on jsfiddle?
[03:14:57] <SaadIbrahim> I think i was thinking lightbox that loads content from database.. sorry about the confusion
[03:15:15] <SaadIbrahim> ^ Remdul
[03:15:22] <shesek> Thumper123, also, the second argument for indexOf is optional
[03:15:25] <Remdul> No worries! :) From what Shesek is saying, little worried about it now.
[03:15:42] <shesek> Remdul, just because it comes from HTML doesn't mean it has to be static
[03:15:43] <Thumper123> Yeah, str.IndexOf("asdf") didnt work either
[03:16:03] <shesek> Just read the data from the database on your server-side code and dynamically create the HTML based on that
[03:16:06] <Thumper123> str contains a valid string which is displayed with alert(str)
[03:16:10] <shesek> Thumper123, are you sure `str` is a string?
[03:16:25] <Thumper123> yeah
[03:16:37] <Remdul> Ahh... I see! Thank you.
[03:16:37] <shesek> Thumper123, hmm... try to reproduce it with as minimal code as possible and paste to jsfiddle
[03:16:50] <Thumper123> ok will do
[03:17:45] <Thumper123> One sec
[03:17:46] <shesek> Thumper123, why here, btw? it seems to have nothing to do with jquery
[03:17:51] <Remdul> My only concern is with most sliders, you're limited to four images. I am trying to design a slider that can go through hundreds of images just by clicking next.
[03:18:09] <Remdul> Does that fall into the dynamic html coding as well?
[03:18:14] <Thumper123> Ah, excuse me
[03:18:23] <Thumper123> I had no idea where to ask
[03:18:30] <shesek> Remdul, I don't know of any four images limitation with any of the sliders I worked with
[03:19:00] <Thumper123> I am using a function to replace an image on hover, and it uses JQuery
[03:19:23] <Thumper123> str contains some unescaped "/", could this be the problem?
[03:19:29] <shesek> Thumper123, no
[03:19:39] <Remdul> shesek, I guess I was relating the photo being pulled from the html line "<li><img src="images/jquery1.jpeg" alt="Css Template Preview" /></li>"
[03:19:41] <shesek> and not any problem in a code that uses jquery is jquery-specific
[03:20:07] <shesek> Remdul, why can't you just have hundreds of those lines?
[03:21:04] <Remdul> Shesek, I am aiming towards having the photos uploaded by the user base, so it'll constantly update. Then, be able to show only photos user A added if requested.
[03:21:56] <Remdul> If they're pulled from MySQL, I can easily allow users to upload to the database, so all users can view the photos.
[03:22:29] <Logitec> Whats the difference between document.body.onload and jquery document.ready ?
[03:24:50] <shesek> Logitec, onload waits for the entire document to load, including any external resources like images
[03:25:17] <shesek> jQuery's dom-ready event only waits until the HTML is loaded and the DOM is ready
[03:25:22] <shesek> so its executed much faster
[03:25:38] <shesek> Remdul, what you need to understand is that its not "from HTML" versus "from MySQL"
[03:26:02] <shesek> Its gonna be either MySQL->HTML->Read by the slider plugin
[03:26:13] <shesek> or MySQL->JSON web services->Read by the slider plugin
[03:26:21] <Logitec> shesek: Thank you, that explains it all, seems like my document isn't loading totally because the onload didnt work but the ready did
[03:26:46] <shesek> Logitec, you welcome
[03:27:28] <Remdul> shesek, Ah... alright. I get it! I just need to change the line that calls the img src to a MySQL query for photo. Then the next button to CurrentID+1 or something.
[03:28:19] <shesek> I'm not sure you have, but if that makes sense for you and you're able to work it out that way... great :-)
[03:28:28] * shesek is going to make some coffee, brb
[03:28:58] <Remdul> I'll try my hardest, at any rate. :)
[03:29:36] <Thumper123> I managed to reproduce it, http://jsfiddle.net/W2H4R/4/
[03:29:42] <VictorCL> why do I get "missing variable name"  = var new = '<tr><td>'+pregunta+'</td><td>'+tema+'</td></tr>';
[03:29:57] <shesek> VictorCL, `new` is a reserved word
[03:30:01] <shesek> use something else
[03:30:02] <VictorCL> xD ok
[03:30:04] <Thumper123> Would be very grateful if you check it out
[03:30:58] <shesek> Thumper123, oh, how didn't I notice it earlier?
[03:31:04] <shesek> s/IndexOf/indexOf
[03:31:21] <shesek> Methods names are case sensitive, and indexOf starts with a lower-case letter (as do most JavaScript's native methods)
[03:31:45] <Thumper123> Ah awesome :)
[03:31:49] <Thumper123> Thanks alot shesek
[03:31:51] <shesek> sorry for making you go through the trouble of jsfiddling it for no reason
[03:32:02] <Thumper123> No, thank you for solving my problem
[03:32:03] <Thumper123> :)
[03:32:11] <shesek> sure, you welcome
[03:32:31] <seutje> consider using an IDE that catches silly mistakes like that
[03:33:07] <Thumper123> Yeah :/ Currently using VS2010, hope VS12 will have improved js support
[03:33:31] <burhan> using .validate() how do you say "valid if fieldA is valid and fieldB is valid and [custom validation]" - [custom validation] I already have as a function, not sure how to ask it to check if the previous fields have passed validation :/
[03:36:58] <Xotix> hi, do you have an good article about code management?
[03:41:29] <nmx1> hey @ all.... has someone a few minutes time ? got an "insolvable" beginner problem!
[03:45:26] <VictorCL> can I do this == $(window.opener.document).find(".testquestions");
[03:45:57] <Xotix> nm1 just ask
[03:50:39] <toot> burhan - you get sorted? rules : { myrule : function(element) { ....}}?
[03:57:02] <Robbster> hi all. I'm using the datepicker and the date that I'm getting back is one day BEHIND the date that is displayed. That is, the following code returns 1 day less than the picker: new Date(dte_from.getTime()).toISOString().substr(0,10)
[03:58:06] <Robbster> I've looked through the docs, can't see anything strange, unless I'm using the Date() object incorrectly? (dunno how though?)
[04:06:57] <nmx1> http://jsfiddle.net/x4jvu/27/  ----- The purple & the lime DIV should  be visible if the mouse is over - but it doesn't work.... has anybody an idea?
[04:09:34] <Oggu> I am having problems with the jQuery valdiation plugin and IE7. I get   Unspecified error. jquery.min.js, line 3 character 13562. jQUery 1.6.3. Any ideas?
[04:13:34] <toot> Oggu - what are you trying to do? they are visible, albeit positioned oddly
[04:14:06] <Oggu> I am using thus plugin. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation Trying to define rules
[04:16:57] <toot> oops - soz Oggu - that was for nmx1 :)
[04:21:27] <nmx1> @toot    --- yes , but they should stay visible while going with the mouse over them
[04:23:37] <toot> nmx1 - take it back to basics and remove the clutter. what is it you are trying to do? have a link that when you mouseover shows two other bits of content, and while you are over them - they stay in place?
[04:25:56] <nmx1> @toot absoluteley right
[04:27:09] <_Jan> hello #jquery, i'm a beginner with everything related jquery and now i'm wondering how it can be that i can only run 1 script on my page... one script that I have built from other snippets and a prebuilt slider... however, together they wont work ...
[04:27:57] <_Jan> the prebuilt one http://jscroller.markusbordihn.de/
[04:28:54] <VictorCL> remove() doestn seem to work on a element I created with prepend()  ...
[04:28:59] <VictorCL> is this correct? .. is there a solution?
[04:29:50] <_Jan> or use hide() ...
[04:31:27] <toot> nmx1: http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html ;)
[04:37:48] <Oggu> I am having problems with the jQuery valdiation plugin (http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation) and IE7. I get  "Unspecified error." In  jquery.min.js, line 3 character 13562. jQUery 1.6.3. Trying to define rules. Any ideas?

[04:42:02] <yangchenyun> Hi, anybody knows how to set jquery different frame-rate for each animation? http://goo.gl/vueiG
[04:51:31] <Xotix> Doing a xml validator as a jquery plugin. Getting xml via url/direct input/upload. Checking it with scima. Can you think of any big problems im going to run into?
[04:58:09] <Cork> Xotix: not really, your basically have a big xml parser as it is
[04:59:05] <medvind> hi. a quick newbie question: how would I go about splitting my code into several js files? $(document).ready(function(){]); can't be invoked in several files, can it?
[04:59:27] <Cork> medvind: it can
[04:59:45] <Cork> medvind: but mostly you want to join your files before you send them to the client
[04:59:49] <Cork> to reduce the load time
[04:59:57] <Xotix> mhm, okay. so doing a xml -> xsd check isn't a problem with jquery/js?
[05:00:10] <medvind> Cork: oh. great, thanks.
[05:00:46] <Cork> Xotix: parsing is easy, validating through schema is prob what you need to implement
[05:00:59] <Cork> Xotix: cause i don't think browsers normally care about schemas
[05:02:11] <Xotix> ok
[05:02:18] <Xotix> thx
[05:04:45] <EdwardIII> hey, stuck on a bit of a simple issue here: https://gist.github.com/1382573
[05:05:09] <EdwardIII> when you hover over 'beavis' it shows butthead, but when you hover over 'butthead' it flickers because it's triggering the onmouseout event
[05:05:16] <EdwardIII> what's a sexy way to handle this?
[05:05:55] <johnline3> not to use inline events
[05:06:09] <Robbster> attach and detach classes
[05:06:23] <EdwardIII> don't suppose you could point me to some documentation on that?
[05:07:25] <EdwardIII> hrm, i guess this? http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[05:07:39] <Robbster> $('ul').delegate('li', 'mouseover mouseout',  function (e) {}); ....
[05:07:40] <xec> or use .hover() http://jsfiddle.net/9EPgZ/
[05:07:59] <johnline3> looking forward to new beavis and butthead shows :>
[05:08:23] <Robbster> xec: nice :)
[05:08:39] <EdwardIII> johnline3: earthshattering - patrick stewart likes b&b you know?
[05:08:46] <xec> =)
[05:08:56] <johnline3> but patrick stewart is boss
[05:08:59] <EdwardIII> hrm xec how could i handle the fadeout if i used .hover()?
[05:09:04] <EdwardIII> yeah he is a hero
[05:09:23] <xec> EdwardIII: what do you mean? doesn't it fade out?
[05:10:11] <EdwardIII> xec: well i kinda need .hover and .hoverFinishedNowDoThis(... don't i? so i can fadeout? https://gist.github.com/1382573
[05:10:32] <EdwardIII> oh  no, it takes 2 arguments!
[05:10:35] <EdwardIII> thanks!
[05:10:35] <xec> yeah :)
[05:11:21] <kollapse> Hi. What is the recommended way of creating a new element ? "var a = $('<div id="..." class="..." style="...">text</div>');" or "var a = $('<div/>', {id: ..., class: ..., style: ...});"  ?
[05:12:06] <WeH> #magento
[05:12:18] <Xotix> Is ActiveX supported by all browsers? or is it a ie standalone thing?
[05:12:29] <xec> IE only afaik
[05:12:32] <EdwardIII> xec magic, works great - thanks for your tips
[05:12:48] <EdwardIII> although Robbster & johnline3 thanks for your tips too - i will undoubtedly want to detatch at some other stage
[05:16:09] <EdwardIII> that delegation looks interesting too, but not 100% sure it would have fixed the issue?
[05:16:29] <Robbster> deleagte will work if you remove and insert li's in your example.
[05:16:51] <EdwardIII> ah ok
[05:17:05] <EdwardIII> hrm gone back to the main app with hover and it's not playing ball
[05:17:10] * EdwardIII compares real app with test case
[05:17:36] <xec> EdwardIII: you can also use .mouseenter() and .mouseleave() events: http://jsfiddle.net/9EPgZ/1/
[05:17:58] <EdwardIII> xec: i think .hover is just an alias for that
[05:18:02] <xec> yeah
[05:18:11] <Robbster> xec: last time I checked the docs there are some warnings about browser compatibility for all those mouse events.
[05:18:14] <xec> but it demonstrates the difference
[05:18:46] <xec> Robbster: really? news to me =/
[05:18:48] <EdwardIII> heh browser compatibility pain
[05:19:04] <eltigre> hey, I am having trouble with the jquery-mobile docs...
[05:20:22] <eltigre> I would like to append elements to a listview via ajax, but  I can't figure out how to "transform" it.  .trigger("create") does not work, and the docs don't say if  "refresh" is a method or event, or on what I should trigger it.
[05:22:07] <Robbster> xec: humm, I remember reading the warning about the mouse events, but maybe it was fixed in 1.7? well, can't seem to find a reference to it now.
[05:22:24] <Robbster> ... or maybe I was reading too fast ....
[05:22:36] <xec> Robbster: yeah, i can't see any warnings either
[05:31:32] <s3d_matt> Hi Al
[05:31:39] <s3d_matt> Im having an issue with my form not submitting
[05:32:14] <s3d_matt> its preventing the default submit, and then - once its been validated by ajax, and the response qualified as a pass, it to continue submitting the form over the traditional post
[05:32:29] <s3d_matt> I was expecting this to work: $('#".$formSelector."').trigger('submit');
[05:33:12] <poppiez> I'm using this code to make sure images have loaded: http://pastie.org/private/eikemdrioqtfkwohouqz1q. however, it seems like using a single image object (this.dummy) causes some trouble. after loading a random image, all future images are true for this.complete. any way to make this work as expected (treat each new src as a new image)?
[05:35:01] <pinkythemouse> http://jsfiddle.net/3wfYs/1/ <- Im having some trouble here. (validation). When picking a service user, the first checkbox in the long list should also be checked. And the checkboxlist has validation rules in place which say that atleast one has to be checked. However, when selecting the checkbox through code from the "click" event on the serviceuser checkbox, the form doesnt revalidate. Anyone know how i can kickoff a revalidate?
[05:35:02] <Robbster> s3d_matt: $('#'+$formSelector).trigger('submit');
[05:35:21] <s3d_matt> Robbster: the line is good (thats a PHP var)
[05:35:51] <Robbster> s3d_matt: side note: you don't need to use trigger(), you can call submit().
[05:36:08] <Robbster> s3d_matt: don't you need to escape the '$'?
[05:36:32] <Robbster> s3d_matt: and even the '#'?
[05:37:03] <s3d_matt> Robbster: the resulting script output is: $('#admin--persons--create').submit();
[05:37:09] <s3d_matt> whichdoesnt work :(
[05:37:12] <s3d_matt> ill paste bin it
[05:37:16] <juria_roberts> How to hide options inside select?
[05:37:42] <s3d_matt> Robhttp://pastebin.com/ZFKCX0SZ
[05:37:47] <s3d_matt> Robbster:  http://pastebin.com/ZFKCX0SZ
[05:38:11] <s3d_matt> Robbster:  I get the alert 'submit me'
[05:38:59] <Robbster> and the form is both "#admin--persons--create" and ".admin--persons--create"?
[05:42:29] <Robbster> s3d_matt: are you using ajax to submit the form data and then submitting it again?
[05:42:36] <s3d_matt> yes
[05:42:36] <Xotix> Do you have a tutorial describing how i cna make a plugin like that: $(".x").myPlugin('someFunction'); or $(".x").myPlugin().someFunction();?
[05:42:46] <s3d_matt> the idea being that the Ajax is just to validate
[05:43:02] <Robbster> s3d_matt: ahh
[05:43:39] <Robbster> what is the form name? you have two references to it:                         data: $('.admin--persons--create').serialize(), but $('#admin--persons--create').submit();
[05:43:55] <Robbster> shouldn't it be $('.admin--persons--create').submit();
[05:44:15] <s3d_matt> yes it should :p
[05:44:20] <Robbster> s3d_matt: :)
[05:44:33] <Oggu> What could cause IE to give unspecified error with submitButton = createForm.find('[type="submit"]'); ???

[05:53:45] <s3d_matt> and binot submitting the actual form :(
[05:56:58] <Robbster> s3d_matt: you should be looping through the submit code. when the validation checks have succeeded, the code re-fires submit(), causing the validation to be checked again?

[06:01:21] <Robbster> use the following syntax for the call to submit when the validation succeeds: submit( [eventData], handler(eventObject) ) (http://api.jquery.com/submit/)
[06:02:10] <James13433> xec, http://jsfiddle.net/yT4g7/ (however I dont think it would work in the jsfiddle anyways.)
[06:02:44] <Robbster> s3d_matt:  so, something like : $('#admin--persons--create').submit({valid:True}); and just check for that flag when processing the original submit. If no event data - trigger the validation, if there is submit data and it is valid:true, return true;
[06:03:10] <James13433> tell a lie xec, it will but you need to make the content iframe really small.
[06:03:41] <held> #hibernate
[06:04:11] <kollapse> If I have an object that is `this` and I only want to update its value with its ID, are there any reasons for using "$(this).val($(this).attr("id"));" instead of "this.value = this.id;" ?
[06:04:19] <xec> James13433: hmm.. i click on "show hidden" once, and it scrolls down, at least in firefox
[06:05:32] <James13433> hmm, so it dones xec, not on my site thouhg :S
[06:07:05] <xec> James13433: you dont have a preventdefault or return false in your click handler?
[06:07:14] <James13433> No I dont xec,
[06:07:42] <James13433> if I did wouldnt work second time round either right?
[06:08:18] <xec> good point
[06:08:51] <xec> i troubleshoot with a shotgun ;)
[06:09:05] <xec> no need to aim if you hit everything
[06:09:10] <xec> :D
[06:09:19] <James13433> lol this is gunna take the piss to work out
[06:10:27] <James13433> ahh I remember, its not a link its a button....
[06:10:43] <James13433> so I had to add onclick="window.location.hash='product-options-wrapper';", hense its not working
[06:21:38] <glitt> guys, where can I find changelogs for every jquery version?
[06:21:49] <glitt> having some wierd bugs after upgrading :/
[06:22:29] <xec> glitt: not sure, maybe you can find some info under http://blog.jquery.com/
[06:22:53] <scorchedwings> glitt - to 1.7?
[06:22:55] <xec> release notes for the latest versions at least
[06:23:23] <glitt> yeah, but was jumping from 1.6
[06:24:15] <glitt> not from the latest in 1.6 branch
[06:24:33] <xec> glitt: google found me this: http://webscripts.softpedia.com/scriptViewChangelog/jQuery-Javascript-Library-Changelog-39111.html
[06:25:15] <glitt> xec: thanks man, I almost never follow softpedia links :)
[06:26:24] <Xotix> I have a js file with a bunch of functions. What's a nice way to manage them? just put them into a file and call them in a different file looks messy. Should i create an object, inherit it an do like obj.function()? Since it is very specific to my app, a plugin would be wrong probably.
[06:27:47] <glitt> Xotix: try module pattern
[06:28:02] <glitt> here you go http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/3/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth
[06:29:00] <scorchedwings> +1 for modules
[06:30:24] <Xotix> thanks i'll take a look at it
[06:31:58] <poppiez> I'm using this code to make sure images have loaded: http://pastie.org/private/eikemdrioqtfkwohouqz1q. however, it seems like using a single image object (this.dummy) causes some trouble. after loading a random image, all future images are true for this.complete. any way to make this work as expected (treat each new src as a new image)?
[06:40:28] <VictorCL> ൬( ۵_۵)൬
[06:40:52] <Xotix> seems like the module pattern was what i was looking for, thanks.
[06:40:57] <visua> $("#audioelem").play(); should work, yes?
[06:41:43] <VictorCL> |ㄖ.ㄖ|
[06:42:08] <emx> i wnat to convert a javascript object into JSON. is there a jquery function that can do it?
[06:42:53] <rroelofs> nope.  you either need the JSON2 lib or native javascript in good browsers
[06:43:09] <emx> rroelofs, ok. thanks :(
[06:43:17] <wolftankk> >> JSON.parse(JSON.stringify({"a" : [1, 2]})
[06:43:54] <Xotix> i can't access privateVariable directly? http://pastebin.com/RwxhKh63
[06:45:56] <Chetic> does the demo here pull a "yo dawg" on anybody else?: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[06:46:19] <Chetic> (pressing submit takes the demo area to the same url I linked to)
[06:48:30] <_ramo1> hi
[06:51:13] <_ramo1> I'm inserting a form after a search in a div... now i try to click on an image and to get a value of this field. the form looks like http://privatepaste.com/e4f6d11774/dfs2334265 and my jquery code looks like: http://privatepaste.com/cc30d38fdb/dfs2334265  but if i click on the form, "undefined" is alerted... but why?
[06:51:59] <_ramo1> does someone has a hint?
[06:53:09] <VictorCL> you dont have a input with class p_id
[06:53:35] <VictorCL> alert($(this).find('input[name="p_id"]').val());
[06:55:25] <mazzachre> Is it not possible to put an accordion into a dialog?
[06:56:03] <VictorCL> _ramo1,  or  alert($(this).find('input#product_id').val())
[06:56:37] <_ramo1> VictorCL: i'll try...
[06:57:06] <VictorCL> or just take off the input and leave find("#product_id")
[06:58:13] <_ramo1> VictorCL: yeah... okay... that worked fine for me...  so do you think, this form is correct? i would like to submit the form, when clicking on the image...
[06:59:17] <VictorCL> yes I think is fine
[06:59:38] <visua> Anyone had any issues using .play() on an audio attribute?
[06:59:49] <visua> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'play'
[06:59:52] <visua> I'm getting that error
[07:00:00] <_ramo1> thank you VictorCL for the help
[07:05:37] <Lichurec> Hi ;]
[07:06:36] <jmaister> hai
[07:07:13] <Lichurec> Short question - is it possible to pass data to a event handler when declaring multiple events using a map?
[07:07:22] <poppiez> I'm using this code to make sure images have loaded: http://pastie.org/private/eikemdrioqtfkwohouqz1q. however, it seems like using a single image object (this.dummy) causes some trouble. after loading a random image, all future images are true for this.complete. any way to make this work as expected (treat each new src as a new image)?
[07:07:56] <glitt> Xotix: you must use "new" to construct that object
[07:08:03] <jmaister> Is it possible to disable the gray overlay on links when clicked on mobile devices?
[07:08:37] <glitt> Xotix: also, that should not be immediately invoking function
[07:08:51] <glitt> Xotix: but a constructor function
[07:09:19] <Xotix> moduleMthod=constructor?
[07:10:04] <_ramo1> am i doing something wrong with the parameters in the $post function of jquery http://privatepaste.com/b941dc8e97/dfs2334265 ? if i var_dump($_POST) i just get the action parameter...
[07:10:34] <glitt> Xotix: http://pastebin.com/6NkExA6W
[07:11:36] <Xotix> but technically, i could do MODULE.moduleMethod();
[07:11:37] <_ramo1> VictorCL: a hint for that too may be? :)
[07:12:05] <glitt> Xotix: yes
[07:12:43] <visua> has anyone successfully played audio with .play()?
[07:13:09] <visua> the only examples I've seen are appending the <audio> tag from within jQuerty
[07:13:19] <Gr3fweN> How do I do this the right way: var myvar = $('ul').append('<li></li>'); <-- I want myvar to point to my li that I just created...
[07:13:29] <jmaister> nevermind, i found a webkit css property that does it: -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0,0,0,0);
[07:14:10] <Lichurec> Gr3fweN: var foo = $('<li></li>').appendTo($('ul'))
[07:14:16] <Xotix> glitt, so why should i create a new object of it?
[07:14:41] <Gr3fweN> Lichurec, Ok. I'll try that
[07:14:47] <VictorCL> _ramo1,   Iguess instead of $(this) , use  productID : $("#product_id").val()
[07:14:56] <VictorCL> the same with sID:
[07:15:11] <glitt> Xotix: encapsulation, having the option of calling the methods from different contexts, etc.
[07:16:01] <_ramo1> VictorCL: that was correct too, great... thank you very much
[07:17:50] <Xotix> glitt so it is just a coding convention, technically the object im creating is the same as the one im returning. of course, the one is inherited from the other but anything else is the same, correctly? So if i just want to manage my code, and im sure i'll never need a second object from MODULE, i can't use it directly, right?
[07:18:29] <Anticom> hi all
[07:18:30] <Xotix> new == {}?
[07:18:36] <Gr3fweN> Lichurec: Thanks, you saved my day :)
[07:18:54] <Anticom> how do i check, wether the clicked element is of type a using the event parameter in the click function?
[07:19:04] <bobbobbins> hey, im adding a hidden input field to my form via jquery, but when i submit the form, that value doesn't carry over, anyone know how to fix that?
[07:19:09] <khmer> Xotix: there is no need to create new instances of an object that you're essentially using as a namespace.
[07:19:24] <khmer> Xotix: however, that's a design pattern called a "singleton" and a lot of people really don't like it.
[07:19:36] <khmer> Xotix: there are good reasons not to, and maybe your code might deserve a refactor
[07:19:44] <khmer> Xotix: but that, i think, is the source of the confuysion
[07:19:53] <Anticom> bobbobbins did you ensure the input field got appended in the right place properly?
[07:19:59] <SargoDarya_> Hey guys, do you have any idea on how I could snap my elements to a global grid instead of a local only grid?
[07:21:02] <bobbobbins> Anticom, if i inspect it, i see it there
[07:21:50] <Xotix> khmer, you mean, the module itself is a singleton if i use it like described? Doesn't a singleton prefent of inherit from it?
[07:21:53] <Lichurec> Gr3fweN: no prob. Var value is always the first element you specify / create
[07:22:13] <Anticom> bobbobbins just to get realy realy sure copy the html, paste it into a simple html-file and fire the form to see wether it's jquery to blame :)
[07:22:58] <glitt> Xotix: it's not a coding convention, because you maintain state in that object, also execution context can be changed
[07:23:31] <glitt> Xotix: and that is where javascript truly shines
[07:24:42] <Xotix> okay, for the beginning i'll go with that and read me throught it. thanks
[07:24:43] <gov_imp> anyone know how to allow for a '/' in a text replace - ie:  .replace(/sometext/someothertext/, "")
[07:25:02] <Lichurec> gov_imp: just escape it
[07:25:06] <c_t_montgomery> \/
[07:25:14] <SargoDarya_> \o/
[07:25:22] <Lichurec> \m/
[07:25:32] <SargoDarya_> \\o// <- that's what birth looks like
[07:25:46] <gov_imp> k thx
[07:26:12] <bobbobbins> hmm, i think it didn't like that the field name was an array
[07:26:43] <mikunos> hi guys, is there a way to embed a flv video modal windowsless just simply using a href link? Exists a plugin?
[07:32:43] <Xotix> glitt: actually, using new for creating an objet out of module doesn't work.
[07:34:35] <Zothos> hi, can someone help me accessing an newly opened windows html? im trying this: var b = windows.open(params); (then change a div in b's html code with jquery)
[07:34:55] <Zothos> $(b).find('.div').html(); doenst work :(
[07:37:30] <glitt> Xotix: look at my paste
[07:37:32] <Gr3fweN> Any way to turn off jquerys autocorrect? I have an ul-list and now I want to cut the list in two just by inserting </ul><ul> but jquery alter it to <ul></ul> (using insertbefore)
[07:43:16] <Jon47> Gr3fweN can we see the code
[07:43:19] <Jon47> in a fiddle?
[07:46:52] <sl00> Hi. Is there a command like extend() but that will extend existing arrays by pushing the new values instead?
[07:46:54] <Lichurec> Gr3fweN: Can't do that the way you want
[07:49:14] <Gr3fweN> Figured that so I'm redoing it... doing the magical before I output it...
[07:49:22] <jmaister> I'm getting this error http://doeswhat.com/2011/03/08/jquery-mobile-error-loading-page/ with jQuery 1.7 and jQM 1.0. Any ideas why?
[07:50:04] <jmaister> adding rel="external" removes the error, but also removes the animations :/
[07:50:06] <Xotix> glitt: so if i would liek to pass jQuery to it so i can use $, how would i do that since i can't use ()?
[07:50:20] <Lichurec> Gr3fweN: it's not a matter of placing some strings; those are separate objects; you can not "split" a Object by inserting anythin inside
[07:51:56] <Lichurec> sl00: .push()?
[07:53:05] <Ch4rAzZz> hi, what is the easiest solution to swap two jQuery objects?
[07:54:31] <sl00> Lichurec: Well. I am extending an object but that object have array-children that I want to push new values at. a={a:[1,2,3],b:1}; b={a:[4,5],b:2,c:3} so "extend"(a,b) would result in {a:[1,2,3,4,5],b:2,c:3}
[07:56:48] <Lichurec> sl00:  there's a'deep' param in $.extend http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[07:57:49] <abonec> hello, how to return to the start of chain jquery methods?  Like end() but to first selector.
[07:58:11] <sl00> Lichurec: That is what I used though and did not result like I wanted. I will try it on my example objects just to make sure.
[07:58:25] <Lichurec> sl00:  JSFiddle please
[07:59:44] <program1> http://pastebin.com/bbhgt22L
[07:59:57] <program1> help me
[08:03:28] <Whirl3d> Mornin' all. I would like to hear some opinions about contact forms if possible: do you use tables for contact form inputs? Do you do inline validation? Advice in general?
[08:04:00] <cuci> hi guys! I'm new to js and I want to make a widget with the following options: no yes. If yes is checked get an input text with please specify. Could you point me in the right direction for it?
[08:04:20] <Lichurec> Whirl3d: just Google, please… it's a jQuery specific room, not a web-0accessibility one
[08:04:53] <Whirl3d> Google's not great for opinions, and I was asking with respect to jquery, sorry if I didn't make that clear.
[08:04:59] <snover> program1: Harassing people with private messages when they join the channel is not a way to win friends or get your problem solved
[08:05:03] <tonyjcamp> cuci: http://www.64notes.com/design/design-and-subsets-essay/
[08:05:06] <tonyjcamp> oops
[08:05:08] <tonyjcamp> wrong link
[08:05:22] <tonyjcamp> cuci: http://eloquentjavascript.net/  is top notch
[08:05:26] <tonyjcamp> a great place to start.
[08:05:39] <Lichurec> Whirl3d: Tables are for tabular data; IF your form includes tabular data - then yes, use tables; In most cases you do not need one
[08:05:41] <AllStruck> snover: you beat me to it...
[08:05:54] <cuci> tonyjcamp: maybe something more specific about it?
[08:06:41] <Whirl3d> Lichurec, thanks. I am signed in here every day (for the last couple of months) and usually people are really opinionated and willing to argue about preferred ways to do things. Just checking. I appreciate your reply.
[08:07:00] <tonyjcamp> cuci: I don't know if there will be something exactly what you want. This is just a great resource if you're new to JS. If you read this, (web version) you could solve that problem.
[08:07:13] <Xotix> whats the difference between var x = function() {}; and var x = (function(){});
[08:07:22] <cuci> tonyjcamp: ok thanks!
[08:07:27] <Lichurec> it's a discussable matter, honestly… I stand on a position that Tables are JUST for tabular data
[08:07:53] <shesek> Xotix, nothing, they're the same
[08:08:03] <Lichurec> if you are like 100% this is actually a tabular data (so row / column corelation) and not just "table-looking thingy"
[08:08:10] <Xotix> so why should i use ()?
[08:08:17] <shesek> Xotix, are you sure you aren't confusing that with (function(){})() ?
[08:08:40] <tonyjcamp> cuci: also check out http://api.jquery.com/   and http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/form-selectors/
[08:08:43] <shesek> Xotix, usually its used for IFFEs, to disambiguate it from a function statement
[08:08:58] <shesek> Xotix, that's not what you wrote, tho
[08:09:04] <Xotix> shesek actually yes,  but i did x() what's the same.
[08:09:09] <Lichurec> shesek: you can actually do function(){}() so the extra () are irrelevant, or aren't they?
[08:09:17] <cuci> tonyjcamp: cool thanks!
[08:09:20] <shesek> Lichurec, nope, that's a syntax error
[08:09:34] <Whirl3d> lichurec, thanks...I'll avoid tables.
[08:09:35] <Lichurec> shesek:  nope, it's not ;]
[08:09:36] <shesek> Lichurec, the parser can't tell that apart from a function statement
[08:09:48] <sl00> Lichurec: For some reason jsfiddle do not output anything to the console when I try it and IE9 do not let you inspect objects either so I do not really know what to do :(
[08:09:56] <shesek> Lichurec, depends on the javascript engine, I guess
[08:10:11] <Lichurec> shesek: don't know a JS engine that throws a error in such case
[08:10:25] <sl00> Lichurec: This is the code tho: var a = { a:[1,2,3], b:1 };	var b = { a:[4,5], b:2, c:3 }; var c = $.extend(true, {}, a, b);
[08:10:27] <shesek> Lichurec, some of them are identifying function statements by the fact that the line starts with `function`, and in order to disambiguate it you must add something before that
[08:11:19] <shesek> Lichurec, Chrome throws a syntax error for `function(){}()`
[08:11:26] <sl00> Lichurec: And the result in c is {a:[4,5,3],b:2,c:3} and not {a:[1,2,3,4,5],b:2,c:3} like what I am looking for.
[08:11:26] <Vooloo> are modal windows blocked by popup blockers or safe to use?
[08:11:40] <Xotix> thanks
[08:11:45] <shesek> Vooloo, they are not blocked by any popup blocked I know of
[08:11:53] <shesek> and I don't see any reason why they would
[08:11:59] <shesek> or how they would even be identified
[08:12:00] <shesek> they
[08:12:03] <eightfold> what i'm trying to do. hide       .Container>.InnerContainer>.ActionsList:last-child         if         .pxField         contains "800", but not "1280". here's my faulty try:
[08:12:04] <eightfold> $('.pxField:contains("800"):.pxField:not("1280")').('.Container>.InnerContainer>.ActionsList:last-child').hide();
[08:12:07] <shesek> they're just a new DOM Element
[08:12:40] <t1m_> hey guys, i have a problem with the jquery draggable objects. There are several objects of different sizes (images) that should align at the same 7*7px grid with their lower left corner... i got the alignment, i got the grid. I am not sure whether it is the same grid and they are aligning with the images' centers or another grid where they are aligning to, this is the code: http://pastebin.com/GWi34ATc
[08:12:43] <shesek> Lichurec, do note that it only happens when the line begins with the `function` keyword, not when its in the middle of an expression
[08:13:02] <shesek> e.g. `1&&function(){}()` does work
[08:13:14] <SargoDarya_> the hell?
[08:13:34] <_ramo1> how do i write something in an existing div if i get data with the $.get method?
[08:13:52] <eightfold> ideas?
[08:13:53] <mikunos> hi guys I get this error ---> "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [@href$="flv"]" this is my selector: $('a[@href$="flv"]')
[08:13:59] <mikunos> any help?
[08:14:21] <chrisvwebdev> @href?  from a json file?
[08:14:33] <jcrawford> guys why can i not get this code to work? http://jsfiddle.net/5Cb9Z/6/
[08:14:47] <jcrawford> what I am trying to do is get the table row element, then for every column cache that data in an array
[08:14:57] <jcrawford> I will then swap the columns data for form fields
[08:15:05] <box> hi. does anyone know how to track links on ajax based websites?
[08:15:11] <jcrawford> but for some reason it does not want to work for me lol
[08:15:13] <shesek> mikunos, no @, that's not XPath
[08:15:22] <Lichurec> shesek: http://www.klauskomenda.com/code/javascript-programming-patterns#module
[08:15:23] <shesek> no need for `"` either
[08:15:33] <shesek> mikunos, simply a[href$=flv]
[08:15:58] <shesek> Lichurec, you should re-read what I wrote, I was very clear
[08:16:26] <shesek> <shesek> Lichurec, some of them are identifying function statements by the fact that the line starts with `function`, and in order to disambiguate it you must add something before that
[08:16:40] <shesek> <shesek> Lichurec, do note that it only happens when the line begins with the `function` keyword, not when its in the middle of an expression
[08:16:42] <Lichurec> ok, the "note" was an addon in the meantime, so no - I did not include that particular (rare) situation
[08:16:42] <shesek> <shesek> e.g. `1&&function(){}()` does work
[08:16:53] <shesek> or `foo=function(){}()` for that matter
[08:18:10] <shesek> Lichurec, its not rare at all - functions are used to simulate block-level scope all the time, in that case you have nothing to do with the function other than invoking it
[08:18:34] <shesek> I think its probably even more common than assigning the return value of it to something
[08:19:39] <jmaister> Can I present a dialog modally as to preserve the state of the page calling the dialog?
[08:21:04] <shesek> Lichurec, also, I do think its important to always wrap the function in () - to help humans disambiguate IIFEs from regular function definitions
[08:24:46] <Hughes_> Hey guys
[08:25:26] <SargoDarya_> I like how IRC always gets me to waste my productive time
[08:26:24] <m3m0r3xXx> true story
[08:26:50] <Lichurec> shesek: I won't argue on that. I think it's a matter of used patterns
[08:26:56] <Lichurec> so maybe you are right
[08:27:11] <Lichurec> in my experience - that's a really rare situation

[08:29:59] <shesek> that's weird - lots of those results are jQuery, so I added `-jquery` to make the results count a bit more fair... and it jumped from 21k to 28k
[08:30:04] <shesek> how's that possible? :S
[08:30:25] <Lichurec> shesek: srsly - dfo you really want to argue about usage patterns?
[08:31:07] <shesek> well, from my experience an IIFE that isn't get assigned into anything is a really, really, really common usage pattern
[08:31:11] <burhan> why is return this.optional(element) added to the condition ( http://rocketsquared.com/wiki/Plugins/Validation/Validator/addMethod#namemethodmessage ) ?
[08:31:16] <Lichurec> I do understand your position ;) I do not use it; I have not meet that usage in any of the projects I got involved in
[08:31:21] <shesek> so yeah, I do think its okay to argue that its common
[08:31:54] <Lichurec> Question is - why do you have so many "IIFE that isn't get assigned into anything"
[08:32:55] <Lichurec> and THATs a matter of used usage pattern
[08:33:48] <Hughes_> jQuery is confusing the crap out of me right now
[08:33:57] <shesek> Lichurec, because I need block-level scope, but javascript doesn't support that...
[08:34:36] <ryanneufeld> Hughes_: is that a question?
[08:34:41] <ryanneufeld> ?ask @ Hughes_
[08:34:45] <Hughes_> It will be in a moment hah
[08:34:50] <Lichurec> and why do you have those "anonymous, self fireing functions" spread like that? Why aren't they enclosed in some kind of global object, for example?
[08:34:52] <shesek> and because `var` declarations in top-level code assigns stuff into the global object, which isn't desirable
[08:34:55] <ryanneufeld> damnit no bot-t
[08:35:21] <Hughes_> @ ryanneufeld: http://aocommunications.accucode.com/tertiary-navigation-test/ Password: test
[08:35:44] <remx> say a variable is "http://domain.com/path/to/file", how do i get the "/path/to/file"?
[08:36:07] <ryanneufeld> Hughes_: what's the question
[08:36:13] <Hughes_> I'm trying to make it so if ANY question is marked yes, one div (Some more content) shows. If ALL are marked no, another shows
[08:36:21] <Hughes_> On clicking the 'check it out' button
[08:36:29] <Lichurec> shesek: once again - I do not think that main jQuery channel is not a good place for such discussion. Once again - I do understand your case, although it's really rarer from my perspective \
[08:36:36] <Hughes_> Js fiddle is here: http://jsfiddle.net/RZnU2/
[08:36:53] <Lichurec> if you wish - we may discuss privately but I hardly have time for that now
[08:37:50] <shesek> Lichurec, three reasons: a. not all the code that I write needs to be accessible to the outside world, some code is purely private. b. sometimes multiple top-level objects shares some code with each other, and than you have to do the multiple assignments inside the function scope rather than returning a single object from it. c. sometimes I just need to create private scope inside my application logic, like when I want to shadow over values from a `for` loop
[08:38:27] <Lichurec> shesek: and yet. you are not listening ;] well… shame
[08:39:07] <Hughes_> Right now the logic for choosing answers, but I'm stuck on making it spit out different responses based on those criteria
[08:39:10] <shesek> well, I was in the middle of writing that when you were writing that... It seemed a waste of time to just delete it :-)
[08:39:20] <Hughes_> The logic for choosing answers works*
[08:40:47] <Hughes_> Any idea how I'd go about all that, or if my code is anywhere close?
[08:41:21] <Lichurec> sl00: sorry give me few minutes
[08:42:25] <Lichurec> Whirl3d: as for your "usually people are really opinionated and willing to argue about preferred ways to do things" I can see that, although I think that's not the way it should work - here.
[08:43:09] <sl00> Lichurec: It is okey. I have solved it temporarly but it is always nice to know if the functionality I am looking for exists in jquery :)
[08:44:09] <shesek> Lichurec, but regardless of usage patterns, its really hard to tell regular functions from IIFE when you write it that way - you have to scroll all the way down and see the function invocation to tell them apart
[08:44:13] <shesek> when I see `(` before `function` I automatically recognize that as an IIFE
[08:47:33] <burhan> hey if I have a custom method (using addMethod) how do I attach that to a field for validation?
[08:48:29] <Lichurec> shesek: I hardly ever use IIFE (as you call them)
[08:49:13] <shesek> not even when assigning the return value to something?
[08:49:24] <shesek> window.foo = function(){ ... }() does count as an IIFE
[08:49:31] <Hughes_> How could I go about showing / hiding divs based on the class certain buttons currently hold?
[08:49:51] <Hughes_> IE, if five yes/no questions are marked NO, show one div, if any of them are marked YES show another
[08:50:13] <Lichurec> again - that's a named function, I do not leave any "unnamed" (anonymous), auto-executed function blocks
[08:51:09] <Lichurec> and when I'm defining a named function - I do know wether it should get autoexecuted or not… once again - a matter of used patterns, incorporate standards, etc…
[08:51:20] <shesek> Lichurec, that example is auto-executed, its the same as the module pattern you linked it
[08:51:22] <Lichurec> The great idea of JS is that it's so flexible
[08:51:47] <shesek> * linked to
[08:52:34] <ryanneufeld> Hughes_: check out hasClass, or $('.class').length
[08:53:12] <Hughes_> I've been playing with .hasClass, but I can't seem to get it working
[08:53:19] <shesek> Lichurec, how do you tell `window.foo = function () { /* lots of code*/ }` apart from `window.bar = function() {/* lots of code */}()`? Either scroll all the way down to check for `()` or by memory?
[08:53:29] <Hughes_> http://jsfiddle.net/RZnU2/1/
[08:54:08] <Lichurec> shesek: there's this handy thingy called "documentation" and incorporate pattern ;]
[08:54:31] <Lichurec> there may be different naming pattern for auto-executed functions
[08:55:10] <shesek> documentation is not a replacement for code that explains itself well
[08:55:15] <Lichurec> all functions should be preceded by small comment block explaining what's this function 'bout and how does it work
[08:56:31] <Hughes_> raynneufeld: Do you see anything glaringly wrong with this JS? http://jsfiddle.net/RZnU2/1/
[08:56:38] <Hughes_> ryanneufeld*
[08:57:02] <Lichurec> shesek: wrong - documentation should be ALWAYS included and proper code patterns should be kept  in a code maintained by more than one person
[08:57:06] <shesek> well, whatever works for you... I'm just sayin', those two extra bytes makes it a lot clearer that the function is about to be executed immediately, and that's much easier to notice than any documentation you could write along that function
[08:57:49] <ryanneufeld> Hughes_: use $('form').submit()
[08:58:03] <ryanneufeld> Hughes_: instead of binding to the click on the submit button
[08:58:13] <burhan> what's that website to post snippets?
[08:58:36] <shesek> Lichurec, I didn't say that proper documentation and code styling guide aren't necessary - they most definitely are - but they're not a replacement for code that explains itself as well as it can
[08:58:42] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ burhan
[08:58:55] <ryanneufeld> jsfiddle.net @ burhan
[08:59:13] <ryanneufeld> Hughes_: also you were missing a closing braces/bracket on your code
[08:59:14] <Lichurec> shesek: true, again - this is not a place for ideological discussions
[08:59:46] <Hughes_> ryanneufeld - somethig like this? http://jsfiddle.net/6UuMU/
[09:00:09] <ryanneufeld> Hughes_: also, use input type="submit" instead
[09:01:03] <shesek> Lichurec, well, non of it really matters anyway - we should all just stop writing JavaScript and work with CoffeeScript, which has a `do ->` syntax that makes this whole discussion pointless :-)
[09:01:36] <Lichurec> shesek:  xD
[09:01:50] <Lichurec> now - be a good boy and bring me a fresh Coffee ;p
[09:02:07] <Lichurec> (hence you used the propper *keyword*)
[09:02:27] <Hughes_> ryanneufeld - I think I'm following.. bear with me, I'm pretty new at JS
[09:02:58] <burhan> I have this code (http://dpaste.com/659824/) - my logic is that partner_1_cid should be valid, if partner_1_name is filled in, and the checksum function returns true; not sure if this is the right way because the second check doesn't seem to be evaluated.
[09:05:31] <burhan> any help?
[09:06:20] <poppiez> is there any plugin to handle touches, swipe events, gestures (pinch in-out) etc.? I'm creating an image gallery
[09:06:37] <Hughes_> ryanneufeld - is this what you're getting at? http://jsfiddle.net/RZnU2/3/
[09:07:07] <PPaul> what should $('checkbox').val() return?
[09:07:55] <ryanneufeld> Hughes_: you should always use braces for if statements
[09:08:23] <ryanneufeld> Hughes_: start by fixing your syntax errors
[09:09:59] <Hughes_> ryanneufeld - That's the problem.. I don't know where to start :\
[09:10:09] <Lichurec> poppiez:  there's a JQTouch or  jquery mobile project
[09:10:13] <ryanneufeld> Hughes_: start by fixing your syntax errors
[09:11:00] <Hughes_> ryanneufeld - That's what I mean.. I got myself over my head here, I don't know what's wrong and where.. i think I got myself a bit more advanced than I was ready for
[09:11:19] <poppiez> Lichurec: thx! :)
[09:11:44] <Lichurec> poppiez: they're much more than you need but just sniff trough the code
[09:12:13] <ryanneufeld> Hughes_: http://jsfiddle.net/RZnU2/4/ start with that
[09:12:26] <ryanneufeld> I gotta run, but at least there are no syntax errors on that one
[09:12:28] <bartmax> im using mvc3, ajax.BeginForm, i want to clear THAT form onsuccess, but i don't have the form who triggered the form, and can't seem to find a way to pass a variable to the onSucess function. anyone?
[09:13:08] <bartmax> all i get is the response, the response type (success) and the XHR object.
[09:13:19] <bartmax> is there anyway from the XHR object kwows who triggered the submit ?
[09:13:22] <bartmax> which form
[09:16:48] <poppiez> Lichurec: yeah, you're right. jqTouch is a bit over the top :)
[09:17:02] <poppiez> Lichurec: I basically need to support pinch zooming. doesn't seem like any of the libs support it
[09:17:15] <poppiez> Lichurec: you know, where you zoom in the area you pinch
[09:20:28] <PPaul> i'm using $(el).is('checkbox') to test if something in my array is a checkbox
[09:20:33] <PPaul> it's not working, though
[09:20:43] <poppiez> is(':checkbox') :)
[09:20:46] <Lichurec> poppiez: they support such gestures ;] just get the proper piece of code from the lib ;]
[09:20:47] <PPaul> thank you
[09:21:14] <poppiez> Lichurec: oh, okay. will look harder
[09:22:22] <Lichurec> well.. at least they did when I last had a look at them
[09:22:45] <Lichurec> i know that current MooTools has those events handled by default
[09:23:16] <Lichurec> poppiez:  did you have a look at http://jgestures.codeplex.com/
[09:24:14] <burhan> any ideas on my paste? (http://dpaste.com/659824/) trying to get validation to work.
[09:25:46] <burhan> it doesn't validate both :/
[09:26:27] <poppiez> Lichurec: no, too bad it's minified :(
[09:28:56] <burhan> what does it mean "dependency-mismatch"?
[09:29:07] <burhan> this is what is returned by my custom validator function.
[09:31:06] <__phil__> hi all, I'm trying to track down this issue.  Would someone please help me?  http://forum.jquery.com/topic/help-me-please-track-down-a-j-handler-apply-is-not-a-function-problem
[09:31:18] <Lichurec> poppiez: those are basically standard events; may have a look on: http://quirksmode.org/mobile/tableTouch.html simple google search for "javascript pinch event" will direct you onto several good on-the-topic discussions
[09:31:57] <Lichurec> there are at least few implementations for jQuery (from what I see) or you might simply code stuff alone, if you really need just the zoom
[09:42:39] <mrryanjohnston> I'm at a loss; why isn't the alertt displaying: http://jsfiddle.net/9xQ87/
[09:45:46] <ryanneufeld> mrryanjohnston: don't use alert
[09:45:53] <ryanneufeld> mrryanjohnston: use console.log
[09:46:04] <bartmax> in your code, delay( is missing is closing )
[09:46:22] <ryanneufeld> bartmax: no it's not
[09:46:39] <bartmax> than i deleted somehow :) lol
[09:46:44] <ryanneufeld> bartmax: it's wrapped to the next line ;)
[09:46:50] <__phil__> hi all, I'm trying to track down this issue.  Would someone please help me?  http://forum.jquery.com/topic/help-me-please-track-down-a-j-handler-apply-is-not-a-function-problem
[09:46:56] <ryanneufeld> it closes after the 1000
[09:47:26] <mrryanjohnston> bartmax: no it isn't :)
[09:47:35] <phlp> mrryanjohnston: your selector is not selecting the input. the input has the id so input:text is not needed. also in postDelay the function(y) is making y not what you expect in the returned function
[09:48:10] <ryanneufeld> __phil__: make a demo in jsfiddle
[09:48:15] <mrryanjohnston> phlp: aw really? :(
[09:48:25] <jmaister> What to do when this happens? http://cl.ly/27042w3q0H3N2Y2r291K
[09:48:45] <jmaister> I'm using jQuery mobile btw :)
[09:49:13] <mrryanjohnston> phlp: thanks I'll look into this
[09:49:19] <phlp> mrryanjohnston: http://jsfiddle.net/9xQ87/4
[09:49:28] <__phil__> ryanneufeld -- interesting tool.  I'll see what I can do
[09:50:14] <mrryanjohnston> thank you
[09:50:15] <mrryanjohnston> phlp: ahhhh
[09:50:31] <mrryanjohnston> I guess because y as I had it before was becoming a paramter variable/.
[09:50:31] <mrryanjohnston> ?
[09:50:44] <phlp> yep
[09:50:55] <mrryanjohnston> thanks very much for the help you guys
[09:51:18] <mrryanjohnston> awesome. works a charm
[09:51:25] <valberg> hi - i have a page where I'm listing some articles, and from the frontpage I'm doing some fancy ajax calls that slide the new content in. At the same time I'm calling window.history.pushState to change the URL so my visitors can easily copy the url for that particular content. The question is, how should I go around serving the same data if the content is accessed directly with the URL (with as little code-reusage as possible of course)?
[09:52:18] <valberg> I know it's now entirely a jQuery-only related question, but I'm using jQuery for the site, so I am hoping there is some sort of trick for this kind of thing :)
[09:53:23] <valberg> a note: the ajax call fetches the data in a JSON format
[09:57:59] <Thumper123> Is there any JQuery function for an improved DropDownList?
[09:58:42] <thcipriani> Thumper123: You mean like a selectbox? You could try dropkick.js
[09:58:52] <thcipriani> or You could try using pointer events
[09:59:36] <BMCouto> Hi, I have several li's in different ul's, how can i know if im clicking on the "overall" 4th li? I'm trying index() but with no success
[10:05:07] <Hopsy> is there a new banerless gyazo?
[10:06:17] <gov_imp> I'm working on a sharepoint list and want to replace text with custom text but don't have a reliable id to reference
[10:07:52] <thcipriani> BMCuto: I'd try $("li").eq(3); for the fourth - haven't tested - just a guess
[10:13:26] <gov_imp_> got dropped
[10:14:12] <gov_imp_> anyway I need to change text on a page but the id I would normally use is dynamically created so no dice
[10:20:51] <gov_imp> sorry can't keep conectted
[10:20:59] <gov_imp> connected
[10:21:28] <lilmikey> hi
[10:21:59] <gov_imp> kinda stuck
[10:22:09] <lilmikey> I have a simple question: how do i call a function to repeat itself when it's done?
[10:22:32] <lilmikey> as in creating an animation that will last forever.
[10:22:57] <Rembane> lilmikey: You could do a forever recursion or put it in a while loop.
[10:24:04] <remx> How do I convert /#/ links to /#!/ ?
[10:24:12] <rabbit123> Hey, someone recommended DropKick.js for a selectbox. It looks great, however it requires the name property set. Unfortunately this is already auto-set by ASP.NET for internal use, is there an alternative?
[10:24:50] <lilmikey> i dont know if a forever recursion is the elegant way do to it
[10:25:13] <lilmikey> i understand what it does is it calls the function from within itself
[10:25:15] <lilmikey> right?
[10:28:15] <gov_imp> and need to create a find and replace script
[10:28:18] <Rembane> lilmikey: Yes. You will fill up the stack and crash the browser. :)
[10:28:38] <lilmikey> stack overflow...
[10:28:41] <lilmikey> ;)
[10:29:36] <lilmikey> do jquery functions have a callback by default, or is it specific only to some?
[10:29:51] <Rembane> lilmikey: BIngo!
[10:30:02] <lilmikey> what i'd like to do is just call it after it's finished
[10:30:47] <gov_imp> I have this https://gist.github.com/1383441 but can't rely on id
[10:33:55] <gov_imp> can jquery provide the location or id of a line of text I specify
[10:36:27] <burhan> are the validators evaluated in order? So if I have required: "foo:filled", minlength: 3 - will it check them in order?
[10:39:40] <PPaul> can i use jquery to set the focus of an element?
[10:40:26] <VeXii> $(selector).focus()
[10:41:10] <PPaul> thanks :D
[10:41:35] <quizme> hey there
[10:41:49] <quizme> after doing a map, i can't do a join.
[10:41:51] <quizme> anybody know why ?
[10:42:12] <ajpiano> quizme: map returns a jquery object, not an array do .map.get().join()
[10:42:20] <quizme> ajpiano thanks!
[10:43:03] <quizme> awesome
[10:43:20] <Rembane> lilmikey: Make another function that is called instead and put the first function in a while loop in the wrapping function, like this: var wrapper = function() { while(true) { f(); } }
[10:45:07] <jcrawford> Good Afternoon.  I have a text field which I have attached a datepicker and in my form if there is no date set when I click save it should add a class to the textfield so that it shows ui-state-error.  It appears to be adding the class fine but the text field is not visually changing, any thoughts as why?
[10:45:26] <jcrawford> it works fine if there is not a datepicker attached to the textfield
[10:46:36] <jcrawford> let me restate that, from and end-users perspective there are no errors when the class is added to the element, however when I inspect the element the class has not been added to it. Hence why it does not visually change
[10:46:47] <jcrawford> I am guessing it has something to do with the datepicker?
[10:48:06] <phlp> jcrawford: fiddle me this
[10:48:22] <jcrawford> phlp: i will try, one moment
[10:48:29] <jcrawford> not sure jquery UI can be fiddled can it?
[10:48:38] <phlp> yep
[10:48:46] <phlp> theres a checkbox for it on the left
[10:51:54] <lilmikey> is the easing plugin part of jquery core now?
[10:52:57] <jcrawford> i cant get it fiddled
[10:53:05] <jcrawford> keeps telling me .datepicker( ) is not a function
[10:53:11] <jcrawford> BS it's part of JQuery lol
[10:53:25] <lilmikey> Rembane - finally, i just made two functions calling each other recursively
[10:53:52] <phlp> jcrawford: did you check the checkbox on the left that says "jQuery UI"
[10:54:11] <Rembane> lilmikey: oO
[10:54:16] <Rembane> lilmikey: That will crash stuff. :D
[10:54:24] <jcrawford> phlp: i don't see that checkbox besides that datepicker is part of JQuery not UI :)
[10:54:32] <jcrawford> I did choose Jquery 1.6
[10:54:34] <lilmikey> Rembane are you serious?
[10:54:53] <ajpiano> jcrawford: datepicker is part of jquery ui
[10:54:56] <ajpiano> it is not part of jquery
[10:54:58] <phlp> it's part of ui.. what's your fiddle link
[10:54:59] <jcrawford> hrm'
[10:55:08] <jcrawford> my bad thought it was poart of JQuery itself :)
[10:55:25] <Rembane> lilmikey: Yes.
[10:55:43] <lilmikey> ok. ill try the while(true)
[10:55:48] <jcrawford> ahhh had to check JQuery 1.7 before I could see the checkbox
[10:55:50] <jcrawford> all set now
[10:56:53] <z3yo> Hi there, why append doesn't work on IE ?
[10:57:19] <burhan> anyone knows about jsfiddle? I keep getting this: "Shell form does not validate{'html_initial_name': u'initial-js_lib'
[11:00:52] <Rembane> lilmikey: Sweet. GL HF!
[11:01:35] <ajpiano> z3yo: append works in IE, when it fails it's usually due to attempting to injectinvalidmarkup
[11:02:47] <jcrawford> alright it works on fiddle in simplistic example but my code is not working properly lol
[11:03:02] <jcrawford> it's a mix of using dialogs and other plugins
[11:04:10] <jcrawford> this is the simple function i have
[11:04:10] <jcrawford> http://pastebin.com/ptJqNUSG
[11:04:45] <jcrawford> basically you call it with an object, string and a string error message
[11:05:09] <jcrawford> the addClass part does not throw an error but nothing updates visually other than the error message being shown from the updateTips function call
[11:07:03] <burhan> can someone please help with this: http://dpaste.com/659875/ - 45 minutes and not going anywhere.
[11:08:29] <blindMoe> burham: www.jsfiddle.net is your friend
[11:08:50] <burhan> it doesn't work there, I get the Shell form does not valide{'html_initial_name': error.
[11:09:29] <burhan> exact error is: "{"error": "Shell form does not validate{'html_initial_name': u'initial-js_lib', 'form': <mooshell.forms.ShellForm object at 0x8f45a0c>, 'html_name': 'js_lib', 'label': u'Js lib', 'field': <django.forms.models.ModelChoiceField object at 0x8f31f0c>, 'help_text': '', 'name': 'js_lib'}"}"
[11:10:32] <Philiqq_> :q
[11:11:39] <phlp> burhan: did you select jQuery on the left?
[11:11:55] <burhan> yes
[11:12:16] <burhan> do I need to check the other two options? jquery lint?
[11:13:05] <phlp> no. i only asked because of the mooshell in the error. thought it might have to do with mootools
[11:13:10] <burhan> even with the two boxes checked, same error.
[11:13:12] <avalarion> Aloha, does someone know a webpage ( I think written with jquery ) where I can easily create presentations with cool zoom effekts and so on? I am missing a name, lost my bookmarks.
[11:13:20] <burhan> I don't know it doesn't like my submit version for some reason.
[11:13:37] <burhan> when I click submit (to check the validation), I get that :/
[11:13:41] <phlp> burhan: paste the link?
[11:13:51] <burhan> phlp: how do I get the link?
[11:14:08] <phlp> click save then it's in the address bar
[11:14:19] <burhan> phlp: http://jsfiddle.net/VPK77/
[11:14:56] <phlp> you dont put script tags in the javascript box
[11:15:50] <burhan> I removed the script tags, and now it doesn't do anything :|
[11:16:38] <phlp> also have to include validate http://jsfiddle.net/VPK77/2
[11:18:31] <burhan> okay that got it to work, (in jsfiddle) - however my problem still is there *sigh*
[11:19:01] <phlp> what is the problem?
[11:19:21] <burhan> well it gives the correct error for minlength 12
[11:19:33] <burhan> but it seems its not evaluating my custom validator?
[11:19:40] <necromancer> is it more efficient to have a single $(document).ready() where you call all of your onload functionality, or multiple $(document).ready() calls throughout a JS file doing the same thing?
[11:20:15] <necromancer> like if i have 3 sections in my site, i have DOM ready calls for each section because they're all in separate JS files (compiled to one big JS file just-in-time)
[11:20:17] <burhan> for example, when I enter 12 digits, and click submit, I get the same error again.
[11:20:37] <necromancer> is it less efficient to have DOM ready calls in each file, or one big file that houses the whole onload event
[11:21:00] <burhan> by error I mean the moo tools + django error
[11:21:03] <Prot> Question: $(':input[value]') should return a set of inputs that have a value attribute, correct? doesn't appear to work correctly with type=file

[11:42:44] <jcrawford> there is my code, to see what is going on add the word test to the name field, testing to the code field and then click the create promotion button
[11:42:59] <jcrawford> the start date form field should have the ui-state-error added to it but it does not for some odd reason
[11:44:01] <jcrawford> anyone else here that could lend a hand with this fiddle?  I think phlp has gone away since he last asked me to fiddle this :)
[11:44:29] <jcrawford> the issue I am having is that when I click the create promotion button the ui-state-error class is not being added to any text fields which I also have a datepicker attached to
[11:44:36] <jcrawford> the fiddle is located at http://jsfiddle.net/hGYGN/9/
[11:46:12] <phlp> jcrawford: your first few lines are missing # for the ids

[12:15:23] <juha_> hello new york

I'm trying to use resizable with grid so users can make events on a weekly calendar grid.  here is my fiddle example: http://jsfiddle.net/winterpk/K8L4c/57/.

[12:28:33] <ldlework> how do I filter from var foldables = $('.foldable_field_div'); elements who have data-errors="true" ?
[12:30:16] <ajpiano> .not("[data-errors='true']")
[12:38:53] <shesek> ldlework, $('.foldable_field_div[data-errors=true]')
[12:39:00] <shesek> ajpiano, why `not()`?
[12:39:27] <ldlework> shesek because I want to filter an existing collection
[12:39:30] <ajpiano> by the way he said "filter from" i assumed he wanted to filter them out of the set
[12:39:33] <ldlework> ajpiano, thanks that worked
[12:40:09] <shesek> ldlework, are you sure? according to your description, you need `filter()`, not `not()`
[12:40:38] <ldlework> shesek, isn't not just a specific filter?
[12:40:56] <shesek> `not` removes elements that matches the selector
[12:41:03] <ldlework> exactly.
[12:41:07] <shesek> `filter()` removes elements that doesn't match the selector
[12:41:07] <ajpiano> they perform the exact same task, one leaves in things that pass the test, the other rejects things that pass the test
[12:41:14] <ldlework> exactly.
[12:41:29] <ldlework> really a matter of taste
[12:41:54] <shesek> cool than. not sure how ajpiano managed to understand that from the description... but as long as you got it to work
[12:41:55] <ajpiano> that's why for people with no taste, there's .filter(":not(.bar)")
[12:42:20] <ajpiano> shesek: like i said, he said "filter from" ... that and doing this for a couple years
[12:42:26] <ajpiano> helps :)
[12:43:07] <shesek> I've been using jQuery for several years too, but I understood it the other way around :O
[13:06:26] <bewl> I am having problems with asyncronous postback and the accordion

[13:23:21] <MagusOTB> If I create a jquery object using $('<html>') and then apped it to two places using appendTo, does it end up in the seconf place, or both places?
[13:24:43] <ShaunR> var result = { 'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3 }
[13:24:48] <ShaunR> were am i going wrong
[13:25:51] <ShaunR> bah, forgot the damn ;
[13:26:44] <bloops> how do I use the response from a $.get request as a jquery context?
[13:27:29] <skamikaze> bloops: $.when( $.get( 'url') ).then( function ( response ) {
[13:27:53] <DanGer> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/refreshing-the-collapsible-set-after-new-elements-have-been-added-through-ajax anyone?
[13:28:10] <bloops> skamikaze: wow! thanks.
[13:28:32] <skamikaze> ?get @ bloops
[13:28:56] <skamikaze> bloops: alternativly use the callback, check the api page
[13:29:16] <bloops> skamikaze: ok
[13:29:20] <shesek> skamikaze, you can .then directly on the promise returned from $.get
[13:29:59] <shesek> MagusOTB, second. Unless you explicitly clone it, the DOM element can only exists in one place, so it'll get moved the second time you append() it
[13:30:15] <ajpiano> shesek: :/
[13:30:19] <ajpiano> that's not true
[13:30:29] <shesek> ajpiano, hmm
[13:30:55] <shesek> that's what my gut says, never actually tried it
[13:30:56] <shesek> lemme see
[13:31:25] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/XYy7B/
[13:31:41] <djQuery> dang ie
[13:31:55] <ajpiano> MagusOTB: i guess that's a subtle way of telling you that you should just try it first
[13:31:55] <ajpiano> :p
[13:32:10] <djQuery> getting errors when testing page in IE and FF that the scripts are being blocked due to type mismatch
[13:32:38] <LazyTown> Hello Everyone,  anybody understand the triggered events and maybe pick know why me link "continueon" is not working,  browser does nothing: http://pastie.org/2900112
[13:32:52] <djQuery> anyone work around this when linking to github files?
[13:33:03] <shesek> ajpiano, than jQuery most be cloning it for every item matched by the appendTo selector. But I was right about his original question tho, http://jsfiddle.net/XYy7B/1/ - just one 'Hello'
[13:33:25] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/ifiyiv/7/edit#javascript,html,live
[13:33:38] <bloops> skamikaze: when using the callback, in function( response ) { ... } I should be able to do $('selectors',response), right?
[13:34:40] <shesek> ajpiano, its kinda weird, really... its unexpected that those two would behave differently http://jsfiddle.net/XYy7B/2/
[13:35:19] <shesek> an element can only exists in one place in the DOM tree, its creating multiple elements when a single appendTo call is used to append into multiple elements
[13:35:20] <ajpiano> when you chain, you act on the set the initial thingreturned
[13:35:39] <ajpiano> .appendTo("#x") means that you'll git the span ("hello") that you created, and then append it into y
[13:36:17] <shesek> ajpiano, appendTo('#x,#y') should also mean append the //same// element to #x, than #y
[13:36:34] <ajpiano> no, because that's the "append with multiple targets"
[13:36:48] <shesek> I can understand why its transparently cloning them in the background to make it work as requested, but it still looks weird to me
[13:37:04] <alaing> anyone know if theres a coldfusion channel on freenode?
[13:38:10] <bobbobbins> hey, im using .remove() to get rid of a popup box when a form submits, but the popup box has the form on it, so when i use the remove, it stops processing the form, how do i make it process the form first?
[13:38:30] <shesek> ajpiano, with something like <div /><div /><span id="a"></span>, $('#a').appendTo('div') you end up with two span#a elements
[13:38:56] <ajpiano> yep
[13:39:02] <shesek> looks kinda weird to me that jQuery would clone it as a side-effect of "append with multiple targets" without explicitly being requested to
[13:39:20] <ajpiano> it's not just "append with multiple targets"
[13:39:28] <ajpiano> it's all manipulation methods
[13:40:15] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/XYy7B/3/
[13:41:39] <shesek> well, yeah, I understand why it works like that, but it feels unintuitive to me
[13:42:44] <shesek> especially appendTo('a,b') behaving different than appendTo('a').appendTo('b')
[13:46:22] <ajpiano> hm
[13:46:47] <ajpiano> i can see that maybe it might be a little magic
[13:46:48] <ajpiano> but
[13:47:02] <ajpiano> i don't know if i buy that one would expect those things to be logically equivalent
[13:47:38] <ajpiano> the first describes an action "append this element inside of all the elements you find that match this condition"
[13:47:40] <LazyTown> Hello Everyone,  anybody understand the triggered events and maybe pick know why me link "continueon" is not working,  browser does nothing: http://pastie.org/2900112
[13:48:27] <ajpiano> the section says "append this element inside of all the elements that match this condition, and THEN take those elements and put them into all the elements that match this next condition"
[13:49:02] <jbrokc_> is there a way to get an element from a jQuery array but keep it as a jQuery object?
[13:49:29] <jbrokc_> that is, not have $("#foo")[0] be just a DOM element but a better way than writing $($("#foo")[0])
[13:49:42] <ajpiano> jbrokc_: use .eq()
[13:49:48] <ajpiano> .eq(0)
[13:49:49] <ajpiano> etc
[13:50:18] <jbrokc_> ajpiano: thanks a bunch
[13:51:37] <jbrokc_> ajpiano: weird, why does $("#foo").eq(0).offset() return null but $("#foo").offset() works just fine?

[14:37:07] <zackiv31> tx, now to write it on my own or look for another solution
[14:37:50] <nickasloan> is there no inverse of $.param()?
[14:38:24] <ajpiano> zackiv31: just take one of the solutions in there :p
[14:38:32] <ajpiano> nickasloan: ben alman has a plugin that does ti
[14:38:39] <ajpiano> it's inside of see ?bbq
[14:38:39] <bot-t> BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[14:38:43] <ajpiano> the $.deparam method
[14:41:40] <nickasloan> ajpiano: awesome.
[14:44:10] <nickasloan> the only thing more awesome would be if jquery had a decoder for all of its encoders
[14:44:42] <ajpiano> the problem is that there's no "spec" for param strings, and jquery internally never needs to decode param strings
[14:45:08] <ajpiano> so it's a lot of code to add
[14:45:18] <ajpiano> and most people tend not to need it, so it's a typical example of something better left in a plugin

[15:23:46] <khurram> i have multiple file inputs in one single form and i want to loop them using javascript
[15:23:46] <sjmikem> Technix: I'm trying to do this from an htmlunit test.  the jquery variable seems to get populated (i.e. window.jQuery is defined), but jQuery("html") is returning null
[15:24:10] <TeckniX> khurram: you can't do it with javascript alone, you'd need something like flash in-between
[15:25:19] <khurram> onClick of button i want to read the file name at client side is not possible ?
[15:26:05] <TeckniX> sjmikem: what do you get with: window.jQuery.isReady
[15:26:10] <ngharo> TeckniX: http://jsfiddle.net/LFPq7/1/
[15:26:26] <TeckniX> khurram: you can read the name but cannot discover its size
[15:27:04] <sjmikem> TechniX: it's returning null (I assume you meant isReady and not isReady()
[15:27:14] <khurram> yes you can Tecknix
[15:27:20] <TeckniX> ngharo: I like the propagation idea
[15:27:31] <TeckniX> I guess I didn't understand why the label would trigger the event
[15:27:38] <TeckniX> khurram: well if you know how, why are you asking?
[15:27:38] <ragas> im trying to replace an iframe with a div, and load the content w:$('#outOfStock').load('/custom_notification_form.html?productname=<%Product.Name%>'); but its coming up empty.
[15:27:54] <khurram> i need the syntax
[15:27:57] <TeckniX> sjmikem: correct - window.jQuery.isReady should return true/false
[15:28:13] <TeckniX> khurram: I'm telling you that javascript can't do this on its own -
[15:28:30] <TeckniX> sjmikem: what does window.jQuery return?
[15:29:10] <sjmikem> hmmm… this is returning null too:
[15:29:19] <sjmikem>         driver.executeScript('window.foo = 42');
[15:29:19] <sjmikem>         println driver.executeScript('window.foo')
[15:29:41] <hightekvagabond> is there a jquery command to clear all styles (both explicit and inherited) from a node?
[15:29:53] <jlipps> hi all! can anyone tell me how to query for a dynamically-created element?
[15:30:46] <TeckniX> jlipps: u mean check if the element exists?
[15:31:03] <TeckniX> sjmikem: typeof window.jQuery
[15:31:08] <TeckniX> that should return function
[15:31:34] <sjmikem> TechniX: it's returning null… something's blocking me from inserting new variables into window
[15:31:37] <jlipps> just select it. for example i created one with $('<div></div>').attr('class', 'xyz'); and appended it to an element. now i want to query with $('.xyz', el).
[15:32:05] <Jon47> jilipps same way as you search for a static one, jquery queries the DOM live
[15:32:40] <carlossuarez> can anyone tell me how to parse a json with sublevels using jquery
[15:32:51] <jlipps> Jon47: looks like you're right---but in my example turns out i needed to use addClass() rather than .attr('class', 'xyz')
[15:32:56] <Jon47> carlossuarez $.parseJson
[15:33:07] <Jon47> uses native json if it exists, falls back to eval()
[15:33:39] <carlossuarez> like $.parseJson('url')
[15:33:44] <carlossuarez> ?
[15:33:54] <Jon47> for that, try $.getJson
[15:34:05] <sjmikem> TechniX: since window.foo = 42 doesn't seem to work, clearly not a jquery problem, right?
[15:34:05] <Jon47> look it up in the API, they'll explain how to use it
[15:34:32] <carlossuarez> so I have to get it first after parse it?
[15:35:00] <Jon47> you have to get it as a string, then parse the string into an object
[15:35:18] <carlossuarez> ok
[15:36:30] <carlossuarez> like var jsonString = $.getJson("url") and jsonObject =$.parseJson(jsonString)
[15:37:59] <winterpk> Does anyone know how I could use .mousedown() event in conjunction with .resizeable() in that it will immediately grab the handle on the mousedown() event?
[15:38:25] <carlossuarez> thanks Jon47
[15:39:03] <Jon47> carlossuarez i think getJson is like doign a get but it parses the json already for you, its just a convenience
[15:39:24] <khurram> hi every one
[15:39:55] <khurram> f.files[0].item(0).size this is the line which gives you the size of file
[15:40:13] <sjmikem> ah ha…. need to do return window.jQuery(…)  for my script instead of just window.jQuery(...)
[15:40:41] <TeckniX> sjmikem: yea sounds like you have other issues
[15:40:48] <rajkosto> how do i submit a form same as normally, but via ajax ?
[15:40:51] <rajkosto> it was post normally
[15:41:49] <sjmikem> TechnIX got it now, thx for your help
[15:41:53] <khurram> Tecknix: f.files[0].item(0).size gives the size of the file on client side with anyother thing
[15:42:04] <TeckniX> khurram: you're assuming the user has ActiveX - then just do: http://www.kavoir.com/2009/01/check-for-file-size-with-javascript-before-uploading.html
[15:42:16] <TeckniX> sjmikem: no pb!
[15:43:12] <TeckniX> khurram: as an fyi "The browser security does not allow the scripts (Javascript/VBScript) or even applets and ActiveX Controls to read files from the local hard disk."
[15:43:17] <TeckniX> that would be a huge risk
[15:43:43] <khurram> Tecknix: how would you do it then ?
[15:44:25] <TeckniX> khurram: checkout SWFUpload
[15:44:43] <khurram> not allowed to use Flash
[15:45:07] <khurram> i have to submit all files one by one using javascript to swift server
[15:45:46] <savid> Is jquery's $.on() function supposed to handle events for elements added in the future?
[15:45:49] <box> why do some websites load javascript with "//blah.domain.com/script.js" without the "http:" prefix
[15:45:54] <imsky> savid: it can do that
[15:46:07] <imsky> box, so https and http don't figure into the equation
[15:46:23] <savid> imsky, is there a special param to make it do that?
[15:46:38] <box> interesting
[15:46:39] <imsky> savid: yes the param resides in the following
[15:46:42] <imsky> ?on @ savid

[15:47:31] <JesperA> khurram are you using OpenStack Object (swift)?
[15:47:38] <khurram> JesperA
[15:47:39] <khurram> yes
[15:47:44] <JesperA> nice, works good?
[15:47:51] <shesek> box, it uses the same protocol as the current page
[15:48:01] <TeckniX> khurram: then you would have to create some sort of hidden iframe to push all files through
[15:48:04] <shesek> if the current page is on http, its loaded from http. if its on https, its loaded from https
[15:48:10] <khurram> JesperA: how can i loop to submit files one by one using javascript ?
[15:48:16] <box> thanks
[15:48:36] <savid> Ah, I see. I'm suposed to use $(document).on
[15:48:41] <khurram> Tecknix: please explain how would i loop the files

[15:49:00] <croby> if I want to extend a jquery-ui plugin (autocomplete) to have a new instance variable that I can access inside methods I define myself in the options, how would I do that? `this` isn't in scope inside that function, and there doesn't seems to be a way to get at the instance
[15:49:17] <carlossuarez> a better question, how do I read a sublevel in json with jquery I mean the json is "item"["name":"ann"]?
[15:49:42] <carlossuarez> I could read the key as the item, but I need the sublevel info
[15:51:11] <imsky> wat
[15:51:51] <savid> Hmm,  except, when using $(document).on(),   "this" no longer refers to the selected element.
[15:52:37] <croby> for example, $.ui.autocomplete has an instance variable of 'pending' -- I'd like to extend it to have another that I define (via $.ui.autocomplete.prototype.myVar = []) but I need to be able to access it inside one of the functions that I override via the options hash
[15:53:30] <rajkosto> how do i get the current form ?
[16:02:00] <nickasloan> any reason why $.extend might simply do nothing?
[16:03:02] <savid> imsky,  when using $(document).on('event', 'selector' ...      how can I get the selected element from within the handler?
[16:03:36] <savid> (since "this" now refers to document)
[16:04:22] <rajkosto> what does the $ in front of variable name mean ?
[16:04:59] <khurram> how to count number of file input in a form?
[16:05:15] <imsky> savid: do you pass in an event in the handler?
[16:05:30] <ajpiano> khurram: $("form input[type='file']").length
[16:05:57] <khurram> ajpiano: thanks champ
[16:06:06] <savid> imsky, ah, didn't think of that.  thanks.
[16:07:09] <khurram> ajpiano: how can i grab the name of every single file in a loop ?

[16:07:45] <ajpiano> i trust me explaining this more verbosely in the past will suffice>
[16:07:47] <ajpiano> ?
[16:08:14] <imsky> savid: btw, $(this) doesn't refer to the document selector
[16:08:19] <imsky> savid: http://jsfiddle.net/YKAud/
[16:10:07] <dabear> I think .on is funny. .bind, .live, .delegate, and shortcuts like .click aren't enough apparently. Let's introduce another one!
[16:10:30] <goleif> Hi! I can't get on() to work on images that is created (after using AJAX, if that makes a difference). $("#uploads").on("click", "li img", function(){ }); works, but $("#uploads li img").on("click", function(){ }); does not. And with the first one, I can't refer to img as $(this). Any ideas why it won't work?
[16:10:40] <imsky> oh god
[16:10:47] <imsky> the next 10 weeks: hi, .on is broken
[16:11:26] <goleif> Ha! Is it really? Or are you messing with me?
[16:12:08] <imsky> it's totally broken
[16:12:11] <imsky> like shattered glass
[16:12:56] <imsky> goleif: do you understand the difference between delegate, live, and bind?
[16:12:58] <ajpiano> goleif: that's because the second usage your are only attaching to elements that are already there
[16:13:04] <ajpiano> goleif: use $(e.target) in the event handler
[16:13:05] <silverwind> Really? So it was simply a coincidence that it works for me.
[16:13:17] <savid> imsky, strange, it was set to document for me.  oh well.
[16:13:18] <imsky> silverwind: pure coincidence. you got the good batch of .on
[16:13:20] <ajpiano> .on isn't broken, and it isn't a "shortcut" dabear
[16:13:34] <ajpiano> it *is* the thing now, all the old apis are shortcuts to it :[
[16:13:36] <ajpiano> :p
[16:13:40] <silverwind> ajpiano, :)
[16:13:43] <dabear> ajpiano: nope, didn't say it was
[16:13:45] <imsky> .on: let's reinvent .delegate one last time
[16:13:46] <silverwind> That's it.
[16:13:51] <dabear> ajpiano: .click is a shortcut :)
[16:14:04] <ryanneufeld> oh my, this discussion... again
[16:14:12] <silverwind> .on is the best thing.. seriously.
[16:14:44] <goleif> ajpiano: Oh alright, I'll try that. Thanks!
[16:14:46] <ryanneufeld> on is confusing if you don't read the docs ;)
[16:14:54] <imsky> ?g jquery on
[16:14:54] <silverwind> I don't think so...
[16:14:54] <bot-t> imsky, .click()  jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/click/
[16:14:58] <imsky> wooo
[16:14:59] <ajpiano> dabear: the point of on was to *unify* the existing fractiousness of the many methods, not "throw another on the phile"
[16:15:06] <silverwind> Only event delegation isn't that obvious with .on
[16:15:30] <imsky> lolwut
[16:16:36] <dabear> ajpiano: reminds me of http://xkcd.com/927/
[16:16:37] <ryanneufeld> thing.on(event, thatHappensWithThisThing, doStuff())
[16:17:00] <silverwind> That's event delegation
[16:17:26] <silverwind> I think they should have left event delegation separate but hey! It's still great.
[16:17:29] <ryanneufeld> yeah, you said it wasn't obvious
[16:17:36] <ryanneufeld> it reads like sentence :)
[16:17:48] <ajpiano> silverwind: there would be no point to it if it didn't do event delegation
[16:17:53] <ajpiano> it would just be the exact same thing as bind
[16:18:09] <khurram> ajpiano: can i submit 5 forms asyncronously ? i.e. i create a form using javascript inside the dom and then submit it asyncronsosously and then create a second form and son on...?
[16:18:16] <ajpiano> khurram: yes
[16:18:19] <silverwind> But bind is ugly :P It should be what is currently called "proxy"
[16:18:38] <ajpiano> silverwind: would you like to join me in my time machine?
[16:18:47] <silverwind> :(
[16:18:47] <ajpiano> we can go back and fix every ambiguous name in jQuery
[16:18:49] <khurram> ajpiano: how would i submit form asyncroonsouly ?
[16:18:51] <ajpiano> and save the future in an alternate universe
[16:18:57] <ajpiano> khurram: using ajax
[16:19:11] <silverwind> ajpiano: I'd love to.. I'd also fix a few things in my life :P
[16:19:15] <imsky> jquery in parts is what i've been waiting for
[16:19:18] <imsky> and now it's here
[16:19:25] <imsky> so suck it new methods
[16:19:41] <ajpiano> heh

[16:22:01] <sunscreen> hrm any one go the spinbox plugin to work?
[16:23:24] <goleif> ajpiano: Is any of those what you mean? (Sorry, it's just hard to find examples of the combo .on and target.event...) http://pastebin.com/bnPYNMvL
[16:25:03] <khurram> ajpiano: do i need to use jquery form plugin for it or normal ajax stuff can also submit a form with file input ?
[16:31:14] <khurram> how can i move the file input field from one form to another form and submit it ?
[16:31:57] <savid> Is there an event I can listen to for when an element is created in the DOM?
[16:35:12] <ajpiano> ?newContent @ savid
[16:35:13] <bot-t> savid, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[16:35:22] <struys> is there anyways to do the following: window[foo] = bar where foo is not a simple name (e.g. foo='fiz.buzz')
[16:35:42] <savid> I tried, ajpiano excellent, thanks!
[16:36:01] <savid> (sorry, forgot to backspace there)
[16:37:23] <savid> ajpiano,  ah, so newContent isn't part of jQuery core
[16:37:24] <shesek> savid, yes, exactly like you wrote it... having any specific issue with it?
[16:37:54] <ajpiano> correct, it is not
[16:38:14] <savid> shesek, you probably meant struys
[16:38:47] <struys> i want window['something.bar'] = window.something.bar
[16:39:14] <struys> if you do window['something.bar'] you get a single key on window 'something.bar'
[16:39:19] <shesek> savid, yes, I meant him, sorry
[16:39:38] <shesek> struys, you have a dot-separated list of keys, and you want to read that from an object ?
[16:39:55] <timwis> Hey guys, I've used jQuery for a while but I'm new to jQuery Mobile. I have a form and when the user clicks submit, I want to take the input's val() and use it to interact with a RESTful API
[16:40:06] <struys> oh shit wait
[16:40:11] <struys> nvm just thought of a solution
[16:40:22] <timwis> Normally how I'd do this is catch the form .submit(), do an e.preventDefault();, then do a $.getJSON() with the input's val()
[16:40:42] <shesek> struys, var obj = {a:{b:{c:{d:{1}}}}}; keys = 'a.b.c.d', parts = keys.split('.'), current = obj; while (parts.length && current = current[parts.shift()]); current // == 123
[16:40:47] <timwis> But it's acting funny, and I think it's because jQuery Mobile automatically manipulates forms with ajax somehow
[16:40:51] <timwis> any ideas?
[16:41:08] <ajpiano> timwis: you can disable jqm's automatic form handling stuff
[16:41:09] <shesek> sorry, should've been `,`, not `;`, after `obj` definition
[16:41:14] <struys> shesek but current = 'some other value' won't work ofcourse
[16:41:29] <shesek> struys, and why is that?
[16:41:39] <timwis> ajpiano: I added data-ajax="false" to the form, but it still seems to be submitting when I do a $.getJSON inside the .submit() function.
[16:41:45] <struys> that will resign current not that value it's pointing to
[16:41:53] <struys> i need to update the reference before i get to current
[16:41:59] <struys> nvm it's kinda weird haha
[16:42:08] <ajpiano> timwis: you have to event.preventDefault() in your submit
[16:42:49] <timwis> ajpiano, yes I've done that. It works fine if I just do a preventDefault() and an alert, but when I add $.getJSON to the mix, it tries to submit the form. I see the page change, and since it's a GET form, the fields are now in the URL
[16:43:11] <ajpiano> event.preventDefault(); $.getJSON(...); doesn't work ??
[16:44:08] <timwis> Waaait a minute, shit..I think I had a minor typo. My apologies.
[16:44:35] <ajpiano> no porablam
[16:44:57] <timwis> lol
[16:45:23] <khurram> ajpiano: i want javascript to directly submit the form which contains many files one by one to the swift server please help  how can i do this
[16:46:04] <ajpiano> um
[16:46:18] <ajpiano> don't think that i'm going to be able to do that right now, sorry
[16:46:28] <khurram> :(
[16:46:35] <ajpiano> you can't asynchronously submit the forms unless you use ajax
[16:46:43] <ajpiano> you might want to look into using the ajaxForm plugin
[16:46:45] <ajpiano> ?ajaxform
[16:46:45] <bot-t> ajaxForm plugin - Full AJAX form support, including file upload capabilities. The primary methods for managing your form are ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/form
[16:47:01] <ajpiano> then you can just take all your forms and ajaxSubmit() them all
[16:47:11] <timwis> wow, if I'm doing a $.getJSON() to another domain, I *have to* use JSONP?
[16:47:22] <ajpiano> timwis: if yo'ure doing *any ajax*
[16:47:29] <ajpiano> to another domain
[16:47:49] <timwis> didn't realise that. so my API needs to support that then. k
[16:53:23] <timwis> Anyone know the common REST syntax for the callback variable? http://site.com/action.json/param/param
[16:55:05] <silverwind> What does callback variables have to do with REST?
[17:02:40] <savid> I'd like to make a global callback for ajax errors -- jquery docs say I should use $.ajaxError as opposed to $.ajaxSetup.   But, $.ajaxError is not a global function?
[17:05:12] <savid> oh, I see, it just takes any element.
[17:11:17] <|^j0ng^Il> could anyone in Google Earth for Linux try going here: http://www.load.to/33oT1FTrHY/amc31.kml and viewing it to see what error it is... for what line of code gives the error.
[17:13:12] <khurram> can javascript grab all files input fields from the form and  send them one by one to server ?
[17:15:09] <hkhalid> hello

[17:19:21] <hkhalid> khurram, asai nahi karo harami ka bachi
[17:20:03] <khurram> hkhalid: what the fuck are u talking dont you know english ?
[17:21:12] <hkhalid> :(
[17:21:51] <ajpiano> khurram: theoretically it can, but you have to atually program it
[17:22:03] <ajpiano> and i can't help you right now
[17:22:13] <Eviltwin> khurram: What's up?
[17:22:31] <ajpiano> and hkhalid was just making an inference that you came from the same background as him and was trying to say something nice and build camaraderie, don't be mean about it
[17:22:41] <khurram> ajpiano: do you have an idea at least to start me with
[17:24:10] <khurram> ajpiano: please explain what do you mean by actually progam it
[17:24:35] <Dave_Stein> what a great line to come in on
[17:24:41] <aaronmcadam> heehe
[17:25:44] <ajpiano> think about the problem in a step by step way
[17:25:52] <khurram> :)
[17:26:25] <khurram> where the step starts champ i have no idea other then to get it from DOM and DOM DOM it so hard that it start sending them :)
[17:26:43] <Dave_Stein> #lost
[17:26:55] <|^j0ng^Il> Would you open this in Google Earth for Linux try going here: http://www.load.to/33oT1FTrHY/amc31.kml and viewing it to see what error it is... for what line of code gives the error.
[17:28:34] <ajpiano> khurram: you actually can't split up the form and send them one by one, input file don't maintain their value when they're manipulated via DOM methods
[17:28:38] <ajpiano> and that would be a prerequisite
[17:28:48] <khurram> hmmmm
[17:28:50] <ajpiano> you'd need each of them to have been in a separate form to start with

[17:36:30] <ajpiano> omg
[17:36:31] <ajpiano> omg
[17:37:11] <hkhalid> hi ajpiano
[17:37:31] <ajpiano> hello hkhalid
[17:40:31] <Spadeski> Can I get some help with Codemirror I need to make this particular code be in Jquery and it has too slect not an id but all the elements with .code                      http://pastebin.com/waXQhN10
[17:40:38] <jwmann> You guys know of a non jquery plugin way to hide an email for spam bots?
[17:41:23] <coldhead> take the webpage offline?
[17:41:59] <jwmann> coldhead: Lol.
[17:46:42] <jwmann> How do I do a callback for an each?
[17:47:19] <jwmann> I'd like to iterate through an array of element. Animating one at a time..
[17:47:30] <jwmann> How would I accomplish this?
[17:48:13] <jwmann> I bet kategeek could tell me. ;)
[17:48:39] <Spadeski> Can I get some help with Codemirror I need to make this particular code be in Jquery and it has too slect not an id but all the elements with .code                      http://pastebin.com/waXQhN10
[17:50:13] <jwmann> You can just do $(".code")
[17:54:01] <Spadeski> jwmann: tried didnt work
[17:54:38] <jwmann> In jQuery $(".code") will select every element using the class code
[17:55:05] <jwmann> It then contains an array of objects that you can then iterate over
[17:55:30] <Spadeski> Yeah I know that but its not in jquery yet :p
[18:00:26] <jwmann> Can somebody help me with this? I'm trying to animate an array of elements one at a time. This is what I have so far but it stops after the first one.. - http://d.pr/NcWz
[18:01:02] <Eviltwin> jwmann: Can you make a jsFiddle example of your problem?
[18:01:28] <jwmann> Eviltwin: It's not really a problem. I'm probably just terrible at coding.. :(
[18:01:39] <jwmann> But I shall do as you ask
[18:02:20] <ragas> im trying to load a form into a div: $('#outOfStock').load('/custom_notification_form.html');  if i use another page, it will load fine, but the form page breaks it.  the form page works fine otherwise.
[18:03:06] <jwmann> Eviltwin: Here is what happens http://jsfiddle.net/zCrjP/
[18:03:39] <jwmann> ragas: Does the page work without the form?
[18:03:59] <ragas> yeah.  i dont get any errors in the console either
[18:04:04] <jwmann> Hmm
[18:04:25] <jwmann> I've never done that with jQuery so I don't think I could be of much help
[18:04:31] <sunscreen> hrm
[18:04:33] <ragas> it looks like its trying to sumbit the form when it loads; the page goes blank, and never finishes loading
[18:04:46] <sunscreen> i am trying to addClass to a input but its like its ignoring
[18:04:56] <ragas> thats if i commandline it in there
[18:08:02] <Eviltwin> jwmann: http://jsfiddle.net/ZUU2D/
[18:09:27] <Eviltwin> Not necessarily the only/best way to do that
[18:09:35] <Eviltwin> But it might help illustrate what you need to do
[18:11:19] <jwmann> Eviltwin: kk, checking it out
[18:12:26] <jwmann> That is some really obscure code o__O
[18:12:32] <rhizmoe> how do i prevent firebug from throwing up these hundreds of jq errors?
[18:14:07] <jwmann> rhizmoe: Code better javascript "{
[18:14:09] <jwmann> :P*
[18:18:06] <Eviltwin> jwmann: Done another way: http://jsfiddle.net/ch4h5/
[18:18:08] <Eviltwin> But less flexible
[18:19:12] <jwmann> Eviltwin: That one makes a bit more sense than the last one
[18:19:43] <Eviltwin> It only works if you're iterating over every child of some element
[18:19:48] <Eviltwin> But it's simpler
[18:20:51] <jwmann> Eviltwin: Where does is go to the next child?
[18:21:06] <jwmann> Eviltwin: It looks like it trying to animate the first element each time
[18:21:06] <Eviltwin> next = next.(...).next();
[18:21:34] <jwmann> Haha
[18:21:39] <Eviltwin> Yes
[18:21:39] <jwmann> Yea just saw it
[18:21:46] <Eviltwin> Chaining FTW
[18:21:58] <sunscreen> how can i get the Id of a <input> from $(This) ?
[18:22:07] <Eviltwin> sunscreen: $(this).attr("id")
[18:22:11] <sunscreen> ok
[18:22:51] <sunscreen> so how could i then references an lable that was for that input id
[18:22:53] <jwmann> Eviltwin: Why do you need to make the next.animation equal to itself?
[18:23:03] <jwmann> Eviltwin: *just trying to understand*
[18:23:38] <Eviltwin> You are setting the variable "next" to the next element after the current variable "next"
[18:24:08] <jwmann> My brain just made a "Wuuuh" noise.
[18:24:11] <jwmann> X__________x
[18:24:26] <Eviltwin> So it starts at $("div:first")
[18:24:29] <Eviltwin> The first div on the page
[18:24:32] <Eviltwin> Animates that one
[18:24:33] <jwmann> yup
[18:24:37] <jwmann> With yea
[18:24:38] <Eviltwin> And changes it to point at the next sibiling
[18:24:42] <Eviltwin> Then it runs again
[18:24:48] <Eviltwin> So it gets moved to the following sibling
[18:24:49] <Eviltwin> And so on
[18:24:53] <Eviltwin> Until there are no siblings left
[18:24:59] <jwmann> kay
[18:25:09] <Eviltwin> That's what the if(!next.length) is for
[18:25:35] <Eviltwin> If we've hit the last sibling, we don't want to loop any further
[18:25:37] <jwmann> Eviltwin: Is it possible to do this without the use of a variable?
[18:25:52] <jwmann> I think the variable is making my brain hurt
[18:25:59] <jwmann> or maybe it's the 3 hours of sleep I got last night
[18:26:18] <Eviltwin> Pretty sure there's no way to do it without a named function at least
[18:26:36] <Eviltwin> Let me see the callback on the animate
[18:27:54] <Eviltwin> jwmann: http://jsfiddle.net/ch4h5/1/
[18:28:45] <jwmann> Eviltwin: This one looks easier to follow
[18:30:44] <sunscreen> this fails.... var ctl = '#'+ $(this).attr("id"); $(ctl).addClass('warning");
[18:31:03] <Eviltwin> Why not $(this).addClass('warning')?
[18:31:29] <sunscreen> ah
[18:31:52] <sunscreen> i am trying to get the input for= that id
[18:32:22] <Eviltwin> $("input[for="+$(this).attr("id"))
[18:32:24] <Eviltwin> Oops
[18:32:27] <Eviltwin> $("input[for="+$(this).attr("id")+"]")
[18:39:44] <zelrik> Hello
[18:41:39] <Eviltwin> Hello
[18:41:47] <zelrik> I need to add a mouseover text for a checklist, a different text for each item in the list that is
[18:41:56] <sunscreen> hm
[18:42:05] <zelrik> here is a sample code of where I got so far: http://pastebin.com/7vq22nem
[18:42:59] <zelrik> it s parts of code I picked from the php files used
[18:42:59] <Eviltwin> ?.load @ zelrik
[18:43:00] <bot-t> zelrik, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[18:43:03] <Eviltwin> Read that page
[18:44:12] <zelrik> ok
[18:44:41] <sunscreen> Eviltwin,  this should work then as well but i cant get no love $("label[for="+$(this).attr("id")+"]").addClass('blbla');
[18:47:38] <Eviltwin> sunscreen: http://jsfiddle.net/JKgR2/
[18:47:59] <Eviltwin> That marks the labels for the empty inputs
[18:48:12] <Eviltwin> I take it that's at least similar to what you're trying to do
[18:48:58] <sunscreen> ah thanx
[18:51:36] <zelrik> Eviltwin: I am not sure there is anything on checklists on that page ?
[18:53:01] <Eviltwin> zelrik: No but the way you're trying to use .load is wrong so I was trying to point you in the right direction
[18:53:20] <zelrik> oh, I thought load worked
[18:53:57] <Eviltwin> Maybe I misread
[18:54:12] <Eviltwin> You do have something weird going on in your HTML
[18:54:19] <Eviltwin> name="barcodes[] onmouseover="test"
[18:54:24] <Eviltwin> Missing a " in there?
[18:54:34] <zelrik> oh
[18:55:07] <zelrik> I added that to test if 'onmouseover' did anything
[18:55:15] <zelrik> typo
[18:55:40] <Eviltwin> Hvae you used the title or alt attributes before?
[18:56:13] <zelrik> no I am learning all this stuff at once
[18:56:20] <Ajay> can any one please tell me what is $ in jquery??
[18:56:56] <Eviltwin> Ajay: It's everything
[18:57:06] <Eviltwin> zelrik: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_standard_title.asp
[18:57:19] <zelrik> Eviltwin: thanks
[18:58:02] <Eviltwin> Ajay: $(...) is an alias for jQuery(...)
[18:58:06] <Eviltwin> Ajay: You can see what it does here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[18:58:16] <Eviltwin> (Like I said, it does everything)
[18:58:33] <Ajay> okay
[18:58:41] <Ajay> and what abt selector??
[18:59:03] <Eviltwin> Do you know what a selector is?
[18:59:05] <Eviltwin> A CSS selector?
[18:59:31] <Eviltwin> Ajay: If not, start here: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[18:59:55] <ajpiano> Ajay, or here, see ?jqf
[18:59:55] <bot-t> Ajay, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[19:00:12] <Eviltwin> Probably a better place to go
[19:00:16] <Ajay> okay
[19:00:26] <Ajay> thanks a lot Eviltwin
[19:00:28] <rajkosto> whats the preferred way of having a function execute on click ?
[19:00:42] <Eviltwin> ?.click @ rajkosto
[19:00:42] <bot-t> rajkosto, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[19:00:43] <rajkosto> from an anchor
[19:01:28] <edgy> Hi, I know I can use var bugCount = $('table tbody tr').length to count the number of rows in my table but I want to count the number of rows in my table that has no <del> in its td's
[19:02:45] <snover> then you are doing it wrong and really what you want is to use classes to mark the rows.
[19:03:03] <Eviltwin> edgy: $("table tbody tr:not(:has(td del))").length maybe
[19:03:16] <Eviltwin> You're probably doing it wrong
[19:06:36] <edgy> Eviltwin: thanks but what do you mean by properly doing wrong?
[19:06:56] <Eviltwin> I mean that while $("table tbody tr:not(:has(td del))").length is relatively short
[19:07:00] <Eviltwin> It'd actually doing a hell of a lot of work
[19:07:17] <Eviltwin> And that you probably shouldn't use the DOM for bookkeeping if you can avoid it
[19:09:37] <zelrik> Eviltwin: I managed to change it but it appear on top of the checkbox now only
[19:09:40] <edgy> Eviltwin: may you please look at my page at munzirtaha.fedorapeople.org/OpenBugs.html because I know I am doing some bad coding
[19:10:12] <Eviltwin> edgy: As long as you're only doing it once, it's probably fine
[19:10:18] <Eviltwin> It'd be if you were running that all the time that it would be bad
[19:10:52] <Eviltwin> How are you making the bug number on the left?
[19:11:30] <edgy> Eviltwin: manually, sequentially, do yo have a better suggestion?
[19:11:49] <Eviltwin> I see the bug number in the source
[19:12:00] <Eviltwin> Isn't the "# of bugs" always the biggest bug number for that table?
[19:12:13] <edgy> Eviltwin: yes, it's
[19:13:17] <Eviltwin> It would probably be faster to grab the bottom row of the table, get the number from it
[19:13:19] <edgy> Eviltwin: I know you can shorten my 10 lines of code in may be 2 lines ;)
[19:13:20] <Eviltwin> And spit that out
[19:13:55] <edgy> Eviltwin: I am completely new to jquery, can you please help on this till I finish reading my book?
[19:14:42] <Eviltwin> edgy: If it works, just celebrate that fact :D
[19:14:55] <Eviltwin> Later on you'll learn more about what's slow and what's fast
[19:15:15] <Eviltwin> If you're doing something once with a small DOM, it's probably always going to be a fraction of a second
[19:16:34] <zulax> i was hoping .animate() would make it look like scrolling
[19:16:40] <zulax> with left : 500px
[19:16:50] <Eviltwin> Like scrolling?
[19:16:52] <zulax> it just sits there at 500 instead of scrolling
[19:16:59] <edgy> Eviltwin: please can I auto number the left column? how can I grab the last number?
[19:17:02] <zulax> Eviltwin, like moving across the screen
[19:17:30] <Eviltwin> zulax: Do you have a position absolute or relative?
[19:17:56] <Eviltwin> edgy: You want to number the left column?
[19:18:00] <Eviltwin> Isn't it already numbered?
[19:18:21] <zulax> Eviltwin, default so abs i think
[19:18:25] <edgy> Eviltwin: I am doing it manually, can I make it like lists being auto
[19:19:42] <zulax> $('#car').animate({   left: '550px',    height: '40'}, 3000 );
[19:19:53] <zulax> initiall its left is 50,
[19:20:07] <zulax> but instead of moving across slowly, it just zaps to 550
[19:20:53] <Eviltwin> zulax: http://jsfiddle.net/Gh5LD/
[19:21:47] <zulax> hmm..that is smooth
[19:24:35] <zelrik> Eviltwin: I finally managed to get what I wanted, thanks again.
[19:25:19] <zulax> Eviltwin, if i explicitly mentino position abs then its working
[19:25:27] <zulax> so does animate no work with relative?
[19:27:11] <pojo> i have a dropdown div for which i hane added a event to DOM click to close it.Now when i click on a checkbox in the div  the dropdown closes how should i avoid it
[19:29:42] <pojo> i have a dropdown div for which i hane added a event to DOM click to close it.Now when i click on a checkbox in the div  the dropdown closes how should i avoid it
[19:30:53] <GoSox> so what exactly is $(this) ? I've used it, and I think I know what it does, but I'd like to know EXACTLY what it does.
[19:31:06] <rajkosto> can i detect a http status code (like redirect) and instead of following it, get the URL ?
[19:34:01] <ajpiano> GoSox: jquery accepts a number of arguments to create a wrapped set of elements
[19:34:11] <ajpiano> one of those is an actual HTML DOM Element instance
[19:34:40] <ajpiano> if 'this' is one of those, then doing $(this) creates a jQuery object from that DOM element, allowing you to use jquery on it
[19:34:59] <GoSox> but what does 'this' specify?
[19:34:59] <Eviltwin> GoSox: Do you know what "this" is?
[19:35:02] <Eviltwin> Oh
[19:35:03] <Eviltwin> No
[19:35:04] <GoSox> like, for example
[19:35:29] <Eviltwin> GoSox: http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/#function.this
[19:35:44] <pojo> i have a dropdown div for which i hane added a event to DOM click to close it.Now when i click on a checkbox in the div  the dropdown closes how should i avoid it
[19:35:45] <Eviltwin> That might help
[19:35:59] <GoSox> i have a .keyup() which calls a function, that function can use $this to set properties of the original element that had the keyup... are there no issues of scope with $this?
[19:36:08] <Eviltwin> pojo: Can you make a jsFiddle example of your problem?
[19:40:38] <GoSox> so i can pass $(this) to a function and use it in that function, but is that something that will work in all browsers?
[19:40:49] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[19:40:50] <Eviltwin> It's JS core
[19:40:55] <GoSox> ok
[19:40:56] <GoSox> thats good
[19:41:03] <GoSox> just saved myself like 1000 lines of code
[19:41:04] <Eviltwin> But understanding what "this" *means* that's cricitcal
[19:41:10] <Eviltwin> critical*
[19:42:17] <playmous> hello everyone
[19:43:01] <playmous> I have a question about jquery ui plugin
[19:44:22] <Eviltwin> playmous: We might be able to help you here but you may also want to ask in #jqueryui
[19:44:24] <playmous> I'm having trouble making something resizable, I know this is probably really basic, but if i downloaded the whole jquery ui 1.8 whatever, do i need to also link to the resizable file?
[19:44:28] <AaronCampbell> If I have 'next' or 'prev' in a var, is there a way to call that a function?  Something like jQuery(this).myVar() to call either jQuery(this).next() or jQuery(this).prev()
[19:44:33] <playmous> o good point, sorry
[19:44:39] <playmous> im kinda clueless here
[19:45:06] <Eviltwin> AaronCampbell: var direction = "next"; $(this)[direction]()
[19:45:16] <playmous> ill head there, thanks :-)
[19:45:16] <Eviltwin> Is the same as $(this).next()
[19:45:57] <Eviltwin> AaronCampbell: Because object.key is the same as object['key']
[19:47:21] <AaronCampbell> Eviltwin: Testing it out...thanks
[19:49:32] <playmous> Hello, I'm back
[19:50:01] <JesperA> ok
[20:39:05] <edgy> Eviltwin: I am back reading ... I tried something like $('table#kde tbody tr').each(function() {
[20:39:05] <edgy>     var bugId = $(this).find("tr:last td:first").html(); but it's null, a bit of help would be welcomed ;)
[20:49:30] <AaronCampbell> edgy: What are you trying to do?
[20:50:11] <edgy> AaronCampbell: I want to select the first cell on the last column something like $('table#id tr:last td:first').find("td").html();?
[20:50:47] <fjsklfsankaj> hello
[20:50:52] <fjsklfsankaj> i have a question
[20:51:01] <AaronCampbell> edgy: Why the .find()?  Is there a td inside the td?
[20:51:11] <fjsklfsankaj> can i hyperlink directly to http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js
[20:51:18] <fjsklfsankaj> ?
[20:51:23] <ajpiano> yes
[20:51:39] <fjsklfsankaj> any problem, because many sites prohibits hotlinking
[20:51:44] <fjsklfsankaj> ?
[20:51:52] <ajpiano> code.jquery.com is a CDN
[20:51:53] <edgy> AaronCampbell: no, but I am new to this. so let me remove find and try ...
[20:51:54] <AaronCampbell> edgy: Just try something like jQuery('#id tr:last td:first')
[20:52:05] <ajpiano> fjsklfsankaj: it's recommended that you prefer the google libraries though
[20:52:06] <fjsklfsankaj> oh, ok, thanks.
[20:52:23] <ajpiano> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.0/jquery.js
[20:52:53] <fjsklfsankaj> but, when jquery will update its version, then i will have to update it on my site too.
[20:53:13] <ajpiano> fjsklfsankaj: you can use a sub-portion of the version string
[20:53:15] <AaronCampbell> I think it would be more efficient to do this: jQuery('#id tr').last().find('td').first().html(), but I'm not totally sure there
[20:53:27] <ajpiano> but then you will be automatically upgraded unexpectedly
[20:53:38] <fjsklfsankaj> hmm, ok.
[20:53:46] <danzik17> edgy: $( "#id tr:last-child > td:first-child" )
[20:53:46] <ajpiano> fjsklfsankaj: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.js will get you the latest jquery
[20:53:51] <edgy> AaronCampbell: : i tried alert ($('#id tr:last td:first')); but got nothing
[20:53:54] <ajpiano> but we do not recommend that you do that
[20:54:09] <ajpiano> it caches not nearly as well, and you don't get to proof your site before upgrading jquery versions
[20:54:10] <fjsklfsankaj> why?
[20:54:16] <GoSox> don't most people just host their own jquery on their server?
[20:54:39] <ajpiano> you just get an upgrade deployed right to production without even asking for it
[20:54:45] <ajpiano> GoSox: many do, many also use the cdn
[20:54:48] <AaronCampbell> edgy: Do you have a link to where you're using this?
[20:55:10] <ajpiano> many use the cdn with a local fallback, as well
[20:55:23] <fjsklfsankaj> hmm, ok, actually, my site dont use a lot of jquery
[20:55:34] <fjsklfsankaj> i use jquery just for minor functions
[20:55:54] <snover> fjsklfsankaj: your nick is so memorable.
[20:56:02] <ajpiano> i dig coal and rare metals out of the ground...
[20:56:03] <fjsklfsankaj> nah
[20:56:04] <snover> is that your real name?
[20:56:06] <ajpiano> i only use jquery for miner functions
[20:56:14] <fjsklfsankaj> my name is shitansh sinha
[20:56:23] <edgy> AaronCampbell: yes, http://munzirtaha.fedorapeople.org/OpenBugs.html
[20:56:45] <fjsklfsankaj> this chat rejected my name said error in name
[20:56:47] <fjsklfsankaj> :(
[20:57:46] <fjsklfsankaj> hi
[20:58:00] <fjsklfsankaj> h
[20:58:01] <Arrows_> How hard would it be to develope a site like quibids.com? How many hours approx?
[20:58:24] <ajpiano> Arrows_: first you have to come up with a completely corrupt business model
[20:58:29] <GoSox> Arrows_: it would take exactly 1,859.6 man-hours
[20:58:43] <ajpiano> like microbid pre purhchase auctions
[20:58:47] <AaronCampbell> edgy: Works for me: alert(jQuery('#kde tr:last td:first').html())
[20:59:05] <GoSox> ajpiano: seriously, that site is a lottery, and running lotteries is illegal unless you are the government, how do they stay in business?
[20:59:37] <fjsklfsankaj> Guys

[20:59:50] <edgy> AaronCampbell: fantastic, yes that works
[20:59:54] <ajpiano> GoSox: i don't know
[21:00:30] <AaronCampbell> edgy: Also works: alert(jQuery('#kde tr').last().find('td').first().html())
[21:01:33] <edgy> AaronCampbell: appreciate your help
[21:02:55] <fjsklfsankaj>  /quit bye everyone. take care.
[21:07:07] <edgy> AaronCampbell: now I fixed the code and reuploaded but instead of all these variables I think I can make a loop, no?
[21:07:46] <GoSox> reupload? I just connect to my server and edit my site live
[21:07:53] <GoSox> Command - S, and my site it updated
[21:09:15] <timwis> Hey guys, I'm experiencing some strange behaviour with jQuery Mobile. I have an empty <ul></ul> in my HTML. My JS code appends <li>'s to it when I run a search. Then, when I run another search, it does empty() on it, and appends <li>'s again. The problem is, the second time it appends them, the <li>'s lose their styling. I notice with the second search, it adds class="ui-listview" to the <ul> (which wasn't there the first time). Any i
[21:11:25] <edgy> GoSox: Command - S? what do you mean?
[21:11:47] <AaronCampbell> edgy: http://paste2.org/p/1789792
[21:11:51] <GoSox> when you are editing live web documents, when you save the document, the website is updated

[21:13:05] <RockMeAmadeus> How would i select $(this :first-child); ?
[21:13:31] <ajpiano> ?concatobj @ RockMeAmadeus
[21:13:31] <bot-t> RockMeAmadeus, You cannot concatenate an object to a string, which is what you're trying to do with $(this + " selector"). If you want to use an element reference as the context for a search, use $(this).find("elem") or $("elem",this).
[21:14:04] <RockMeAmadeus> thank ajpiano
[21:15:01] <edgy> AaronCampbell: elegant, now I don't need to update all those numbers every time, really appreciate your help
[21:15:48] <edgy> AaronCampbell: but I wonder why you use jQuery instead of $? is it for a reason?
[21:16:03] <AaronCampbell> GoSox: Don't be a cowboy coder - watch this: http://wordpress.tv/2011/08/20/mark-jaquith-scaling-servers-and-deploys-oh-my/
[21:16:41] <GoSox> based on both the first 5 seconds of that video, and on how long that video is, i'm going to pass.
[21:17:44] <GoSox> how can i see what kind of html element $(this) is?
[21:18:13] <Cork> GoSox: this.nodeType
[21:18:43] <Cork> GoSox: sorry nodeName
[21:20:56] <timwis> Got it. Had to use .listview('refresh')...which was tricky because you have to make sure *not* to do it before it's initialised otherwise it doesn't work :/
[21:22:03] <GoSox> Cork: i'm getting undefined for $object.nodename, but $object.attr(); right after it, seems to know exactly what $object is, it sets its class no problem.
[21:22:39] <Cork> GoSox: not $(this).nodeName just this.nodeName or $(this)[0].nodeName
[21:23:16] <Cork> GoSox: you might be able to access it through prop, not sure
[21:23:30] <GoSox> $object[0] worked
[21:23:36] <GoSox> though it returns an all caps tag name
[21:23:39] <GoSox> is that normal?
[21:23:43] <GoSox> is it always uppercase?
[21:23:56] <Cork> yes
[21:25:03] <Cork> GoSox: .prop('nodeName') works too
[21:25:12] <Cork> and i would actually recomend that way
[21:25:52] <GoSox> cool
[21:26:02] <GoSox> so why is it uppercase?
[21:26:13] <GoSox> its funny because every website i've ever seen, as been written in lowercase
[21:27:01] <Cork> GoSox: it became a standard when xhtml came
[21:27:16] <GoSox> hmm
[21:27:22] <Cork> before it was VERY common for html pages to have the tab in upcase and attributes in lowcase
[21:27:48] <GoSox> tab?
[21:28:02] <Eviltwin> You know, like in a bar?
[21:28:12] <Eviltwin> The thing where you can let the bill just build up
[21:28:17] <GoSox> oh, not tab like the soda
[21:28:33] <Cork> GoSox: sorry *tag
[21:29:00] <Cork> as ex. <TABLE border="1">
[21:29:12] <GoSox> oh
[21:29:18] <GoSox> i've never coded like that
[21:29:22] <GoSox> eek
[21:29:30] <Cork> as i said it changed with xhtml
[21:29:53] <Cork> it was quite needed with the tag sope that existed back then
[21:30:10] <Cork> and things like frontpage created it by default :s
[21:30:16] <Cork> (that was less nice :D )
[21:30:26] <GoSox> oh man frontpage
[21:30:34] <GoSox> you used to be able to tell a frontpage website from a mile away
[21:30:39] <Cork> ya, worst junk there ever was
[21:30:45] <Cork> ya
[21:32:07] <dogarrhea2> jquery draggable with [0,5] specified should prevent the draggable from moving from right to left correct?
[21:32:46] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: That's a beter question for #jqueryui
[21:33:05] <dogarrhea2> except there are 3 people there
[21:33:42] <Eviltwin> Well there are 771 people here
[21:33:54] <Eviltwin> But the odds of any of them being here and being able to help you jQuery UI are pretty low
[21:34:40] <dogarrhea2> why so pessimistic. i've gotten help with jquery ui before
[21:34:57] <dogarrhea2> either way i'll find out
[21:34:58] <blaenk> say I have a ul of li's and I want to insert a new li after the third li in that ul, is this possible?
[21:35:32] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: I'm just saying that there aren't a lot of people here who help regularly and know a lot about jQuery UI
[21:35:54] <Eviltwin> ?.after @ blaenk
[21:35:54] <bot-t> blaenk, .after(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[21:36:00] <Eviltwin> ?.insertAfter @ blaenk

[21:39:44] <krz>       console.log($('#foo'));
[21:39:48] <krz> returns []
[21:39:49] <krz> why?
[21:40:00] <krz> #foo clearly exists in the html markup
[21:40:09] <Eviltwin> <div id="foo"></div>
[21:40:27] <krz> er
[21:40:50] <krz> thanks Eviltwin
[21:40:59] <Eviltwin> no problem
[21:52:38] <dogarrhea2> looks like jquery ui is broken
[21:52:45] <dogarrhea2> maybe i'll find a different lbirary besides jquery

[22:10:00] <rhizmoe> is $.param(foo) not good for nested foos?
[22:11:11] <Nirvanko> Why the function `serialize` might not get value of a checkbox and radio buttons?
[22:11:15] <rhizmoe> i'm getting undefined for all nodes.
[22:11:37] <Nirvanko> It works fine for all input elements except for those.
[22:14:40] <Nirvanko> Forgot to say the FORM element is being copied in a dialog window. Perhaps this is the problem?

[22:16:11] <heptal> i can remove all the formatting classes before the $.post just fine, but it wont' work afterwards
[22:16:24] <heptal> i've tried delays, tried to implement a callback
[22:16:36] <Cork> ?p @ heptal
[22:16:36] <bot-t> heptal, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:16:59] <Cork> don't forget to include an example of the html sent
[22:18:41] <Eviltwin> rhizmoe: http://jsfiddle.net/6afH3/
[22:19:34] <Cork> Nirvanko: uncheched radioboxes and checkboxes isn't serialized
[22:19:41] <Eviltwin> Yup
[22:19:54] <Cork> Nirvanko: other then that it shold work find as long as you give them a value="<something>"
[22:19:57] <Eviltwin> May have misread but I think he said it wasn't getting any of them
[22:20:03] <Cork> *fine
[22:20:11] <Nirvanko> I check them every time while making test.
[22:20:21] <Nirvanko> Still nothing.

[22:23:42] <davidedwardclark> respect the fiddlez
[22:23:59] <Cork> Nirvanko: and just to make sure http://jsfiddle.net/54DU7/1/
[22:24:58] <Eviltwin> I think my favorite thing is when people come in here and say, "I've found a problem with jQuery"
[22:25:25] <Eviltwin> And it's 100% their fault
[22:25:50] <Cork> its less fun when its not...
[22:25:55] <Cork> like http://jsfiddle.net/ZmxvS/
[22:26:07] <Cork> (my personal peve)
[22:28:19] <Eviltwin> What's the problem with this?
[22:28:38] <rhizmoe> Eviltwin: thanks
[22:29:53] <Cork> Eviltwin: add class="" to the div
[22:29:53] <Murugaratham> in my page there are 7000 selectors available and when i try to find 1 object
[22:30:04] <Murugaratham> it takes very long to select and it seems to be synchronous
[22:30:12] <Cork> Eviltwin: or change jquery 1.6.4 to 1.5.2 and see the differense
[22:30:19] <Murugaratham> is the selector async or sync?
[22:31:15] <Cork> Murugaratham: selector async?
[22:31:17] <Eviltwin> Murugaratham: Selectors?
[22:31:20] <Eviltwin> They're synchronous...
[22:31:23] <Cork> uh.. js ins't async
[22:31:23] <Nirvanko> Cork, could you take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/4GQ2Y/
[22:31:32] <Nirvanko> I don't get what's wrong
[22:32:10] <Murugaratham> when i run the script on ie 7 and below, it prompts an error saying that it's taking too long to run
[22:32:24] <Eviltwin> Nirvanko: Remember what he said about how they need to be selected/checked to show up?
[22:32:31] <Murugaratham> so the only way is to use a better selector or reduce num of elements?
[22:32:39] <Cork> Nirvanko: you don't have any values for your checkboxes
[22:32:40] <Eviltwin> Murugaratham: We need to see your code to help you out
[22:33:01] <Murugaratham> the page is very big, done by someone else and it's almost 9k+ lines of html
[22:33:28] <Cork> Murugaratham: time to reduce the code to find where it hangs
[22:33:29] <heptal> Cork: here's what I have, the jquery doesn't seem to work in the page
[22:33:31] <heptal> http://jsfiddle.net/2D79J/2/
[22:33:32] <Murugaratham> im just trying to bind an onclick event
[22:33:39] <Eviltwin> Murugaratham: To what?
[22:33:41] <Eviltwin> Every element?
[22:33:48] <Cork> Murugaratham: comment out parts until it stops hanging and see what part it hangs on
[22:33:52] <Murugaratham> to a subset of elements
[22:33:55] <heptal> but the function to apply the style classes works fine; it's the removing overlapping styles following the function that is a mystery
[22:34:07] <Eviltwin> Murugaratham: What version of jQuery?
[22:34:14] <Nirvanko> Why would I need values for checkboxes?
[22:34:15] <Murugaratham> the previous guy was using .live("click", function () {…})
[22:34:18] <Murugaratham> 1.6
[22:34:20] <Eviltwin> Hell no
[22:34:23] <Eviltwin> Do not use .live
[22:34:27] <k1t> any ideas why the rails console shoots me the help info when i try to run console in production? runs fine for same app on local
[22:34:29] <Eviltwin> Use .delegate or .on
[22:34:36] <especially-corn> hello can anyone tell me what's wrong with  $('tr').not('td').each(function(){
[22:34:36] <especially-corn>    var x = $(this).(':nth-child(2)').html();
[22:34:36] <especially-corn>    alert(x);
[22:34:48] <Nirvanko> <input type="checkbox" name="some_option"> that's all.
[22:35:00] <ajpiano> $(this).find(":nth-child(2)"), especially-corn
[22:35:38] <k1t> oops wrong channel sry
[22:35:38] <especially-corn> ajpiano, that works! but why is it not respecting the $('tr').not('th').each(
[22:35:40] <Eviltwin> Murugaratham: Instead of $("[selector]").live("click",function(){...}), do $(document).on("click","[seletor]",function(){...}) or $(document).delegate("[selector]","click",function(){...})
[22:35:44] <Cork> ah, ajpiano, the one i've been waiting for :)
[22:35:46] <especially-corn> ajpiano, it does that even for the table header
[22:36:03] <ajpiano> especially-corn: because tr's are by definition not th's
[22:36:06] <ajpiano> of course they... aren't ths
[22:36:08] <Cork> ajpiano: i found something in jquery 1.6.4+ jquery that broke toggleClass animation
[22:36:20] <Murugaratham> Eviltwin so the functions are lazily bound?
[22:36:21] <ajpiano> especially-corn: i think you're looking for $("tbody tr").find("td')
[22:36:32] <ajpiano> Cork: cool story?
[22:36:34] <Cork> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/ZmxvS/ (add class="" to div or change it to older jquery version)
[22:36:45] <ajpiano> Cork: good lawd
[22:36:46] <Cork> i'm not sure where i should report this
[22:36:54] <ajpiano> try using callbacks bro
[22:37:03] <Eviltwin> Murugaratham: Not really, .live does something pretty stupid
[22:37:06] <ajpiano> then if the issue persists, explain what the problem is
[22:37:10] <Eviltwin> And very wasteful
[22:37:10] <Cork> ajpiano: its a wip just to trigger the efrfect
[22:37:20] <Eviltwin> That .delegate and .on don't do
[22:37:21] <Cork> ajpiano: its not code used anywhere
[22:37:24] <ajpiano> Cork: http://bugs.jquery.com
[22:37:29] <ajpiano> Cork: but it's a terrible test case
[22:37:39] <ajpiano> what happens when you actually use callbacks?
[22:37:45] <ajpiano> the same effect?
[22:37:58] <Cork> ajpiano: the error happes as soon as you animate with a class that has no class="" attribute
[22:38:09] <Cork> the times is to do it three times to make it more visible
[22:38:11] <ajpiano> uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[22:38:19] <ajpiano> toggleClass doesn't even take a duration in jQuery core
[22:38:24] <ajpiano> it's only in jQuery UI
[22:38:36] <Cork> ajpiano: i asid jqueyr + jqueyr-ui broke
[22:38:39] <Cork> *said
[22:38:45] <Eviltwin> See #jqueryui
[22:38:46] <ajpiano> oh
[22:38:54] <ajpiano> then report it to http://bugs.jqueryui.com
[22:39:05] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: don't refer people to #jqueryui, we clear all that support in here as well
[22:39:14] <Cork> ok, so the answer is its a ui problem, thats what i was unserten about
[22:39:34] <ajpiano> yep
[22:39:35] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: I just did that because I've seen people do it in the past
[22:39:52] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: yeah, i have to tell other people that too
[22:39:55] <Eviltwin> I guess that's not the place to go
[22:40:23] <especially-corn> ajpiano, $('tbody').find('tr').each(function(){ still fails
[22:40:33] <especially-corn> ajpiano, doesn't fail but includes the header too
[22:40:41] <ajpiano> especially-corn: that's not the code you wanted anyway lol
[22:41:11] <especially-corn> ajpiano, i'm doing some actions on the table rows and for every 2nd td i want to extract the data and store it somewhere
[22:41:19] <ajpiano> ok yeah that's not what you want then
[22:41:41] <ajpiano> you want $("#sometable tbody td:nth-child(2)")
[22:41:45] <ajpiano> that should do the trick
[22:42:11] <ajpiano> assuming your dom isn't an absolute wreck
[22:43:08] <Cork> heptal: is the html persistant and all thats sent is the json?
[22:44:44] <especially-corn> ajpiano, that indeed works but it's not the only action i want to do on the table, isn't it inefficient to loop twice on the same table with two different actions when i could possibly do it in one loop?
[22:44:44] <heptal> the html is generated with php; yea; the JSON is used only for assigning style classes
[22:44:58] <heptal> i've now got it working with a setTimeOut but i'd like something cleaner
[22:45:29] <heptal> i suppose it has to do with the asynchronous nature, and i need to figure out how to create a callback on my own function
[22:45:33] <ajpiano> especially-corn: what, you want to do something else to every 3rd child td, or something?
[22:46:15] <heptal> i
[22:46:18] <especially-corn> ajpiano, no i want to add a class (of different background) to every second tr, you know like on books and stuff to make it easier to follow the row
[22:47:27] <Cork> heptal: i don't see anything wrong with you don't wait for the ajax before you do cleanUp/setTimeout
[22:47:29] <ajpiano> especially-corn: $("#sometable tbody").find("tr:nth-child(2n)").addClass("even").end().find("td:nth-child(2)") etc
[22:47:41] <ajpiano> especially-corn: you definitely don't need to do that all in one chain... or in one loop
[22:47:43] <Cork> *your code, except you don't
[22:48:01] <heptal> how you you do that? i started this week in jquery, haha
[22:48:57] <Cork> heptal: http://jsfiddle.net/2D79J/4/
[22:48:57] <especially-corn> ajpiano, makes sense, thank you
[22:49:01] <ajpiano> cool
[22:50:00] <heptal> cool i'll give it another try
[22:53:16] <heptal> works great; thank you Cork
[22:58:24] <Eviltwin> For a literal input string

[23:05:02] <biyectivo> not for me
[23:08:42] <RyanV> hi.  just curious, is there a way to change the direction of a toggle animation?
[23:09:04] <RyanV> i.e. bottom-left to upper-right
[23:10:27] <Axsuul> is there any way to see what events are bound to an element
[23:11:04] <Cork> Axsuul: $(this).data('events')
[23:11:15] <Eviltwin> Axsuul: Some debuggers let you see
[23:11:22] <Eviltwin> Like WebKit's and maybe Firebug
[23:11:50] <Eviltwin> So does this work for anyone in any browser they have: http://jsfiddle.net/Ut8zA/1/
[23:12:28] <poppiez> anyone with jgestures experience? the lib looks great but I can't find a cancel event. when a mouse is swiping and stops without being a swipe I need to know that
[23:12:50] <duckribs> Eviltwin, no
[23:12:57] <Cork> Eviltwin: is there a reason why you need the id on the input field?
[23:13:13] <Eviltwin> Just reproducing the situation I first saw it in
[23:13:16] <Cork> Eviltwin: its not the first time i've seen id addressing collision
[23:13:39] <Eviltwin> Cork: I'm not sure there's any way to submit this form though
[23:13:42] <Eviltwin> Because of the submit field
[23:14:59] <Cork> Eviltwin: var button = $('#submit'); button.removeAttr('id'); $('form').submit(); button.attr('id', 'submit');
[23:15:20] <Eviltwin> Yes, I meant without tampering with it
[23:15:29] <Eviltwin> Same applies for name="submit"
[23:15:30] <Cork> don't think so
[23:15:38] <Cork> it overwrites the function name
[23:15:43] <Eviltwin> In which case I don't think that data gets passed along
[23:15:48] <Eviltwin> I know it overwrites the function name
[23:15:57] <Eviltwin> I don't think that's the right behavior
[23:16:15] <Cork> Eviltwin: its speced actually
[23:16:37] <Cork> i've worked through the same thing but for a tags
[23:16:37] <Eviltwin> This seems like the wrong choice
[23:16:45] <Cork> it is
[23:16:52] <Cork> but its legazy
[23:17:01] <Cork> loads of old pages break without it
[23:17:13] <Eviltwin> I think it's time to start breaking old pages
[23:17:37] <Cork> you could prob sniff html5+ and handle it from there
[23:17:43] <Cork> but not sure browsers are interested
[23:18:09] <Cork> just don't name your fields the same as default functions and your fine
[23:18:15] <Eviltwin> This came up because I was trying to help someone debug
[23:18:24] <Eviltwin> Calling $("form").submit() was failing
[23:18:27] <Eviltwin> Exception inside jQuery
[23:18:39] <Eviltwin> But I think something in his code was eating it
[23:18:41] <Eviltwin> So we weren
[23:18:47] <Eviltwin> 't seeing it right away
[23:18:56] <Cork> ya, but document.getElementByTagName('form')[0].submit(); fails too
[23:19:05] <Eviltwin> Right
[23:19:07] <Eviltwin> I know
[23:19:18] <Eviltwin> It's not jQuery's fault
[23:19:29] <Eviltwin> But perhaps something jQuery could warn about? IDK
[23:19:32] <Cork> if anything its something validators should alert about
[23:19:59] <Cork> Eviltwin: not sure it belongs in the framework
[23:21:15] <Eviltwin> There are some try-catch's inside jQuery
[23:21:31] <Eviltwin> But I think they just eat particular known and unimportant errors
[23:21:45] <Cork> ya, but alerting about "your using a coliding name/id" isn't something you can catch with a try catch
[23:21:46] <Eviltwin> Or errors resulting from certain browser feature tests
[23:22:23] <Cork> when your at it you could sweep the page for duplicate id's too
[23:22:34] <Cork> its for validators, not frameworks
[23:23:06] <Eviltwin> It was just annoying when a super vague error message was coming from deep inside jQuer
[23:23:10] <Eviltwin> y
[23:23:19] <Eviltwin> Had to switch over to non-minified
[23:23:27] <Cork> the same happens if you write broken selectors
[23:23:28] <Eviltwin> And even then what was actually happening was somewhat obscured
[23:23:30] <heshanh> if i want to stop a form from submitting when the submit button is clicked, do i set prevent default on theform or the button
[23:23:41] <Eviltwin> Like which broken selectors?
[23:23:49] <Cork> Eviltwin: you sould never develop with minimized jquery
[23:24:00] <Eviltwin> Cork: Wasn't me doing the developing
[23:24:02] <Cork> Eviltwin: send an object to combined with the selector
[23:24:18] <Cork> Eviltwin: didn't mean it as "you" you, just anyone
[23:25:25] <Eviltwin> Sizzle actually gives somewhat resasonable responses: http://jsfiddle.net/hQRhR/
[23:25:59] <Cork> Evixion: depends on what you happen to send in
[23:26:03] <Cork> *Eviltwin
[23:28:24] <Eviltwin> Maybe it's just one of those things for the knowledgebase/docs I keep meaning to writ
[23:28:27] <Eviltwin> e
[23:28:57] <burhan> for validator plugin; how can you specify a class to be applied to the label container?
[23:30:50] <burhan> errorLabelContainer: $("p", container), this puts plain <p></p> in my container, but I want it to write each error as <p class="message error"><p>error 1</p><p>error 2</p></p>
[23:40:00] <Nirvanko> Cork, in Chrome I get all data while FF still didn't get values of checked radio buttons and checkboxes. Damn, who has f*ed up my brain, FF or jQuery? Whom should I chop off hands?
[23:41:23] <Cork> Nirvanko: has you added the missing value fields?
[23:41:35] <Nirvanko> Yes, I did.
[23:41:46] <Cork> you have the link again?
[23:41:55] <Nirvanko> moment
[23:42:07] <Cork> the old one is ok
[23:43:58] <Nirvanko> http://jsfiddle.net/jWKEB/
[23:44:39] <Nirvanko> No problem with Chrome, and shit with FF. Damned, I've spent two hours for that crap.
[23:44:52] <Nirvanko> I don't f* believe
[23:49:27] <Spadeski> sup everyone
[23:49:43] <Cork> Nirvanko: wfm http://jsfiddle.net/jWKEB/2/
[23:49:54] <Spadeski> Cork ever use codemirror?
[23:50:25] <Cork> nope
[23:52:05] <burhan> is there a way to chain the order of validation?
[23:54:49] <poppiez> anything similar to jgestures out there but with more events? need stuff like doubletap, touchcancel etc.
