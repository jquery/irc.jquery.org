[00:10:51] <coldhead> sasori: yes, don't use <input> but use an id that is unique, or a class
[00:11:02] <coldhead> or even $('input[name=gender]')
[00:11:21] <sasori> ok, another question, how to get the value of a hidden field using jquery? so that i can prepare it too for ajax ?
[00:11:51] <coldhead> $('input[type=hidden]').val()
[00:11:52] <sasori> say e.g <input type="hidden" name="userid" id="userid" value="$_SESSION['user']" > something like that
[00:11:53] <coldhead> or
[00:12:02] <Cork> ?.serializeArray @ sasori
[00:12:03] <bot-t> sasori, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[00:12:10] <coldhead> $('#userid').val()
[00:12:16] <sasori> ok thanks
[00:22:49] <coldhead> i always think you are in ireland, Cork
[00:22:56] <coldhead> in County Cork
[00:22:57] <hrwath> hehehe

[00:23:29] <Cork> i've gotten that a few times before :D
[00:23:56] <coldhead> you should visit and go online there
[00:23:59] <coldhead> that would blow minds

[00:35:06] <jomofcw> Hello =)
[00:35:37] <rookmoot> hi
[00:36:53] <rookmoot> http://jsfiddle.net/pZn6P/
[00:37:56] <rookmoot> i'm doing this, using a show event to add a ajax method to my form... my problem is that when i click and some tabs, then go back to a previous form, it calls as many time as i clicked on tabs the ajax request
[00:38:34] <rookmoot> is their a way to prevent repetition ? ie. to set the .ajaxForm() only one time by form ?
[00:38:57] <rookmoot> s/click and some/click on some/
[00:39:51] <gnarf> rookmoot: why not setup the ajaxform before the content loads, or is it ajaxed in?
[00:40:01] <gnarf> s/loads/shows
[00:40:34] <rookmoot> the tabs are ajaxed
[00:41:39] <gnarf> k, but obviously cached? :)
[00:42:07] <rookmoot> maybe i can destroy the tab's content when it will be hide
[00:42:40] <rookmoot> i wonder if that'll remove the jquery instance of ajaxForm
[00:43:14] <gnarf> rookmoot: you could do something like var form = ui.panel.find(".ajaxForm"); if (!form.data("ajaxFormed")) form.ajaxForm().data("ajaxFormed", true);
[00:44:27] <rookmoot> gnarf, i give it a try
[00:46:14] <rookmoot> gnarf, not working :)
[00:46:57] <rookmoot> hm the fact is, that the click on a form, did not call only many time the current form but it calls all the form that have already been ajaxForm()ed
[00:48:01] <gnarf> rookmoot: thats an odd behavior
[00:48:12] <gnarf> doesn't seem like any of the code you posted would create that problem
[00:48:21] <gnarf> and I'm pretty sure .ajaxForm() can work on multiple forms
[00:48:33] <gnarf> do they have the same ID by any chance?
[00:49:09] <rookmoot> ajaxForm use the $(this) element to set is behavoir
[00:49:15] <rookmoot> so i don't think that's the probleme
[00:49:18] <rookmoot> problem*
[00:54:35] <tdignan> I have an html subtree of elements in a variable.. I want to take that and match other elements inside it, then transform their character data.. I see .html() does this, but how do I do it on a subset?
[00:54:47] <sasori> question: is jquery's $.ajax data param , space sensitive ?
[00:54:55] <sasori> i mean white spaces
[00:57:32] <rethus> anyone knows a goot plugin to resize and move div-layers (will use it for help-window)
[00:58:12] <Woet> rethus: jquery ui?
[00:58:21] <rethus> yes
[00:58:27] <Woet> it isn't goot, but it's definitely good :)
[01:00:49] <rethus> Woet: any idea?
[01:00:56] <sasori> question: is .attr('value') the same as .val() ?
[01:00:57] <Woet> i mean
[01:01:01] <Woet> jquery ui is a good plugin to do that..
[01:01:01] <Woet> lol
[01:03:13] <gar_onn> sasori, no
[01:03:23] <sasori> gar_onn: why not?
[01:03:42] <gar_onn> .val() works on all input type elements in a useful way, including <select>...even in the cases of <select multiple>, checkboxes, and radio buttons (in which .val() gets or sets an array of selected values not just a string).
[01:03:42] <gar_onn> So basically they serve different purposes, even though .attr('value') behaves the same in some situations, like textboxes. The preferred method is .val() to get consistent behavior everywhere.
[01:03:47] <styol> sasori: your name is not brian by chance is it?
[01:04:09] <tdignan> how do I get a handle back to the element I clicked in a click() handler?
[01:04:42] <sasori> gar_onn: +1 .thanks :)
[01:04:55] <sasori> styol: no  :P
[01:05:12] <sasori> my name is brani :)) :P
[01:05:16] <Paveloosha> Hi guys, I am sending and loading a object through $.post('calculation.php',{formData:object}, function(data){alert(data)});.. and in PHP file I am using $formData = $_POST['formData']; echo $formData['name']; .. Now problem is "alert(data)" is returning "[".. any ideas!!
[01:05:22] <tdignan> is my question not good?
[01:05:22] <gar_onn> Tigeda, what do you meen?
[01:05:27] <gar_onn> *mean
[01:05:33] <styol> tdignan: $('.element').click(function(){ var mahElement = $(this); }); like das?
[01:05:43] <tdignan> oh, $(this)
[01:05:47] <tdignan> herp derp thanks man
[01:06:30] <styol> sasori: hmm :) it was just because i knew someone from high school that used that pseudo name... sorry bout that
[01:06:42] <gar_onn> Paveloosha, check your network tab, to see what your PHP is actualy returning
[01:07:09] <sasori> styol: from what country are ya/
[01:07:42] <styol> sasori: USA, Los Angeles, CA in particular
[01:07:58] <sasori> oh , ok i see
[01:08:22] <styol> sasori: yeah i googled sasori and then quickly realized its more common than i imagined :) my bad
[01:09:23] <Paveloosha> <gar_onn>, if i send object diectly like {formData:object.name} , it is printing actual data.. but if I try to print it like this echo $formData['name'], this is making problem..
[01:11:03] <burg> http://anvelope-vaslui.ro/s/index.php?page=clients -- click on every logo link , you will see that first time you click nothing happens, after that every time you click it will open the photo in fancybox -- why does not open from the first time? check line 134 from source to see the live click binding. this is not from fancybox, the same happened with other plugins like that
[01:17:00] <gar_onn> Paveloosha, try var_dup($_POST) in your PHP, what does it give you?
[01:17:35] <Paveloosha> okay trying..
[01:18:07] <dr0id> var_dump
[01:20:03] <gar_onn> Paveloosha,  indeed var_dump
[01:22:19] <josefrichter> guys, how do I toggle setInterval function? I need a link that will setInterval on first click and clearInterval on second click. Any hints please?
[01:23:35] <rethus> can i manipulate accordion in ui-theme to open just 50% of the window?
[01:24:24] <Paveloosha> <gar_onn>, thank you. I am trying..
[01:26:06] <ablomen> josefrichter, var timeout; timeoutFunc = function ( ) { if (timeout) { clearTimeout(timeout); } else { timeout = setTimeout(something, 1000); }; $("a").click(timeoutFunc);
[01:26:51] <ablomen> (but then use actual valid code ;) )
[01:27:12] <josefrichter> ablomen: will try that. thanks
[01:29:08] <rethus> i try to generate the following help-window-system in jquery: default on buttom of page - user can open it or close it (only a little tab with label "help" left). But the user also should be able to resize the size of the window and should be able to toggle it on each side of the monitor (top, left, right and button) by drag&drop
[01:32:37] <molavy> i have somting like this :{"errs": {"body": "<ul class=\"errorlist\"><li>This field is required.</li></ul>", "type": "<ul class=\"errorlist\"><li>Value u&#39;2&#39; is not a valid choice.</li></ul>", "title": "<ul class=\"errorlist\"><li>This field is required.</li></ul>"}}
[01:33:52] <molavy> i want select element like id_body id_tittle and id_type and set red border
[01:35:00] <molavy> my problem is when i use this code for (i in responseData.errs) $("id_"+responseData.errs[i]).css(border-color","red")
[01:35:38] <molavy> responseData.errs[i]  return This field is required and not body or type and title
[01:35:43] <handsomepig> anyone knows use ajaxupload3.9+php upload file and show it?
[01:36:24] <molavy> any idea?
[01:37:29] <molavy> there is no idea?
[01:37:36] <abracsi> hi guys
[01:38:20] <toberger> hey guys, I'll try to use a tooltip (from jQuery Tools, http://flowplayer.org/tools/). The content with the tooltip will be called via ajax. So I need a live function around it. But I don't know how to solve this. This is my JavaScript: http://flowplayer.org/tools/
[01:38:23] <toberger> Any hints?
[01:38:42] <abracsi> i'm about to start exploring Canvas. i wondered if jquery allowed me to take any short cuts with this, or do i need to just grit my teeth and use mostly pure javascript?
[01:39:00] <Woet> abracsi: http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/canvas
[01:39:24] <Woet> for example http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jCanvas
[01:39:27] <Woet> "jCanvas is a collection of jQuery methods aimed at making the HTML5 canvas easier to write for. The plugin is simple and easy to learn, and it gives you much flexibility."
[01:39:35] <Woet> sounds like the thing you're looking for
[01:39:42] <toberger> erm, copy paste error :) my javascript: http://jsfiddle.net/AZp5k/
[01:39:52] <molavy> any idea?
[01:39:55] <abracsi> Woet, thanks a lot :)
[01:40:52] <gizero> Hi. I'm using nested tabs. By default there's a big vertial space between tabs, which I have recued by reducing the padding on ui-tabs-panel like this: .ui-tabs .ui-tabs-panel { display: block; border-width: 0; padding: 0.5em 1.0em; background: none; }. That works for every browser, except IE7. Any clues?
[01:46:04] <nore> hi guys! I'm new to jquery and javascript. Please, help me understand one problem. Ajax should update one portion of a page and I need to do something on the updated content. But somehow when I call a function, it can't find the new elements. All my code is in that .ready() clause. Thanks for your assistance!
[01:46:36] <toberger> nore: are you trying to use an event like click after ajax call?
[01:46:42] <gizero> Solved it by using this trick: http://old.nabble.com/UI-Tabs-Alignment-in-IE-td16045047s27240.html
[01:47:07] <Woet> ?demo @ nore
[01:47:08] <bot-t> nore, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:47:11] <nore> toberger, no, I just need to get a particular element by id
[01:49:01] <nore> the content is being updated, but the function is being executed before dom is ready, I guess.
[01:49:48] <toberger> nore: paste your code at jsfiddle, so we can have a look
[01:51:44] <nore> I call several functions one by one and they depend each other (e.g. function2 may use the content created by function1).  Normally, I'd expect, the second function is executed after the first one finished. But, it's not happening.
[01:52:17] <chubz24469> jsfiddle link?
[01:52:43] <molavy> no idea?
[01:53:45] <molavy> there is no idea?

[02:00:54] <muzone> How do I turn my radio inputs into buttons like in "CHOOSE A SIZE" at http://www.theoutnet.com/product/217611 ?
[02:01:05] <blackspotwiggins> i cant really understand what you are trying to accomplish, but probably submit event handler is not the right thing
[02:01:18] <josefrichter> ablomen cant make it work. could you take a look please? http://jsfiddle.net/josefrichter/DWBW2/
[02:01:45] <blackspotwiggins> if you are not doing ajax then the page is reloaded btw
[02:02:03] <blackspotwiggins> you cant access results from the previous script anyway
[02:02:09] <IamTrying> blackspotwiggins, on file upload i need to have more custom values from the server. Such as file size, total amount, total relational database info etc. and store it in another input
[02:02:10] <muzone> *AIRHOOOOOOOOORN*
[02:02:21] <Patatouf> i would like to use $(this) in the "success param" of the $.ajax function but it doesnt work. any idea ? (here is my code : http://pastebin.com/WZ4b43cx)

[02:03:18] <blackspotwiggins> jut render correct form on serverside
[02:03:41] <Cork> muzone: thats just css border on the label element
[02:06:13] <IamTrying> blackspotwiggins, when the submit i get return data in the iframe. But the same returned values/infos i want to copy to same page input element. Should i read inside the iframe and crawl it?
[02:06:35] <blackspotwiggins> why the fuck are you using iframe in the first place
[02:06:48] <muzone> Cork: would you recommend doing that too?
[02:06:50] <blackspotwiggins> i guess you could use onload
[02:06:56] <muzone> I just found http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#radio by the way - what y'all think?
[02:07:21] <Woet> muzone: you mean that feature that has been in my website for about a year now? :P
[02:07:22] <Cork> muzone: you could just use the button feature from jqueryui
[02:07:35] <ablomen> josefrichter, http://jsfiddle.net/DWBW2/1/
[02:07:42] <Cork> muzone: but that would work too
[02:07:43] <muzone> Woet: can i see it?
[02:07:52] <Woet> muzone: it's in a control panel for customers
[02:07:52] <muzone> Cork: what would work too?
[02:07:59] <IamTrying> blackspotwiggins, thats the only one i can trust and worked always for custom file uploading. Anyway i think i can read back from hidden iframe and copy paste the results
[02:08:00] <Patatouf> what is the eventtype : "as soon as the div is displayed"
[02:08:01] <Patatouf> ?

[02:10:28] <Cork> Patatouf: there is no sourch event
[02:10:53] <Cork> there is a load event but i don't think that exist of divs
[02:11:09] <Cork> muzone: http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#radio this is what i would recomend

[02:12:03] <chubz24469> DerStoffel: haha i knew someoen would get a kick out of it
[02:12:14] <Patatouf> Cork:  oh, what would be the correct code to execute an $.ajax function for a set of div with a specific class ?
[02:12:18] <DerStoffel> chubz24469: ofc!
[02:12:40] <Cork> Patatouf: for a set of divs?
[02:12:47] <Cork> Patatouf: what are you trying to do?
[02:13:46] <Patatouf> that : http://pastebin.com/vH79deWX. But instead of clicking. I would like it to happen for each div when the doc is ready
[02:14:41] <Cork> Patatouf: you can listen for the .load even from the flash plugin
[02:15:11] <Cork> Patatouf: not sure, but i think youtube sends an additional event when its loaded
[02:15:25] <Cork> like can_play or something like that
[02:15:26] <Patatouf> Cork: i dont render the videos yet
[02:15:50] <Cork> Patatouf: so you just want to run the loop for each div on the page?
[02:15:58] <Patatouf> Cork: exactly

[02:28:05] <Woet> what is this for kind of witchcraft muzone
[02:28:08] <muzone> Cork: fuck! but all I need is a border and some padding!
[02:28:18] <Woet> oh, right, what Cork said
[02:28:24] <Cork> muzone: ya, and you can add that you'r self if you want
[02:28:31] <Woet> jsfiddle doesnt add the css :)
[02:28:35] <muzone> the jquery ui css is huge!
[02:28:37] <Cork> muzone: or extract it from the jquery-ui
[02:28:37] <Woet> muzone: get the CSS of the buttonset from jquery-ui

[02:33:26] <Scott34> er.. Cork, i mean.
[02:33:31] <Cork> Scott34: you need to create an async loop: var $elms = $(selector); function next(index) { $elms.eq(index++); setTimeout(function() { next(index); }, 1000); }; next(0);
[02:33:53] <Cork> + a check for index >= $elms.length

[02:36:12] <Cork> Scott34: if you want to pause a loop, the js will stop, that means the entire page will hang
[02:36:53] <Cork> Scott34: the only option would be to run the loop async, but then everything would happen at the same time at the end
[02:38:12] <Cork> Scott34: alternativly you can use jquery queue, but thats about as tricky as setTimeout
[02:45:26] <muzone> I'm trying to turn my radios into buttons like on http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#radio - but what's wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/c7TgB/s
[02:47:39] <Cork> muzone: your missing the default css for jquery
[02:48:16] <Cork> ui-widget, ui-state-default and ui-corner-left to be persise
[02:48:57] <muzone> Cork: didnt see you there
[02:50:19] <Dr4g> Good morning :)
[02:50:48] <Cork> muzone: http://jqueryui.com/themes/base/jquery.ui.theme.css
[02:52:06] * muzone is lagging badly
[02:52:38] <muzone> Cork: Is there no easier alternative?
[02:52:41] <Cork> muzone: or just generate what you need here http://jqueryui.com/download
[02:52:55] <Cork> uncheck everything but core, widget and button
[02:53:01] <muzone> I don't want to incorporate all those lines into my CSS and try to disable them one by one in order to find the bare minimum - it's gonna take hours
[02:53:25] <Woet> you could also just read the comments so you know which ones to skip
[02:53:26] <Woet> :P
[02:53:27] <muzone> Yup - I did that actually. My custom jQuery UI does not include ui-widget.css by the way
[02:53:44] <Woet> or, ignore all of it, look at the html jquery generates  and make your own css
[02:53:48] <Cork> muzone: it does, but its merged into one file
[02:53:58] <muzone> Oh I see
[02:54:06] <toberger> Is it possible to load a css file via ajax and put it into the head section?
[02:54:06] <muzone> but what's wrong with doing it the way The Outnet does it?
[02:54:12] <muzone> is it not accessible enough maybe?
[02:54:25] <Woet> disable javascript and see what happens, muzone
[02:54:36] <Cork> muzone: not really wrong, just not as stylish
[02:55:03] <Cork> muzone: as it looks a bit wierd without js, and doens't really look like something you can click if you don't know it
[02:55:30] <muzone> you talking css-wise now?
[02:55:53] <Cork> muzone: both
[02:56:16] <Cork> muzone: outlet adds the css statically, so it looks the same even if the js doens't run
[02:56:16] <muzone> but
[02:56:33] <muzone> yeah
[02:56:36] <muzone> isn't that a good thing?
[02:56:40] <Cork> muzone: that means the interface is a bit broken without js
[02:56:46] <Cork> muzone: it doesn't work the same
[02:56:51] <muzone> like "perfection is achieved, not when there's nothing left to add, but when it's nothing left to take away"
[02:57:11] <Cork> muzone: progressive enhansment is how it should be done
[02:57:32] <Cork> muzone: not add everything and add the actions if you can
[02:57:32] <Paveloosha> HI.. <gar_onn> , I got where was the problem :) it was due to "jquery.min.js" file.. problem is no longer if I use "jquery-1.5.min.js" ..
[02:58:04] <Paveloosha> By the way, do you know why is that!!
[02:58:27] <Paveloosha> <gar_onn>, Thank you so much..
[02:58:30] <muzone> thanks but no thanks
[02:58:49] <muzone> you failed to convince me why i shouldn't just do like theoutnet
[02:59:08] <Cork> muzone: cause if js is disabled, they get a broken interface
[02:59:29] <muzone> but who disables js these days anyway?
[03:00:03] <Cork> muzone: i run most pages with js off actually
[03:00:27] <Cork> muzone: and the number of users using noscript isn't that small
[03:02:26] <muzone> cool

[03:27:23] <misterm> oDesk: can you create a live testcase in jsfiddle/jsbin or pastebin the code
[03:27:37] <muka> hi all!
[03:29:34] <coldhead> tv is so contrived
[03:29:55] <muka> I'm looking how to register custom events to be attached later in code trought eg. bind
[03:31:02] <oDesk> misterm: i'll try to make live testcase, but i've actually now tested on IE8 and it doesn't complain
[03:31:35] <oDesk> misterm: you can check jquery-1.6.2.js  line 5379  there was a known bug there
[03:32:25] <oDesk> misterm: which i don't understand how to avoid it in this simple line  $(document).read(function(){from_js_file('sdsd','sd');});
[03:35:10] <oDesk> misterm: i'm on chrome v14  and firefox v5    those face problem with line 5379, but IE8 is ok

[03:39:55] <misterm> oDesk: I don't see a bug here
[03:40:04] <misterm> oDesk: I see a fix for a bug in Chrome
[03:40:40] <misterm> oDesk: do you mean you're hitting this issue in Chrome and this doesn't fix it? I'm not sure I undertsand your problem, sorry

[03:48:59] <coldhead> muka: $('whatever').bind('someevent

[03:52:12] <hardnrgg> anyone have any suggestions on Android browser and setting focus on a select element, with the focus occurring purely via JS. IE. Button A, triggering a "select".focus() doesn't work \
[03:52:17] <hardnrgg> =\
[03:52:56] <muka> coldhead: thank you, so $('x').trigger("couldDoSomething", {data: "argument"}); is the correct way to register/subscribe the event? For dark reasons, isn't binding..
[03:55:00] <coldhead> i don't know about that {data} bit sorry
[03:55:10] <coldhead> let me try on jsfiddle
[03:57:07] <coldhead> muka: basic version http://jsfiddle.net/DCPhN/
[03:57:28] <muka> coldhead: I would "declare" the event so in custom later code optionally  bind to the event
[03:57:49] <coldhead> you don't have to declare it
[03:57:58] <coldhead> you just start using it
[04:02:09] <coldhead> muka: http://jsfiddle.net/DCPhN/1/
[04:02:17] <coldhead> that seems to work for arguments
[04:03:12] <muka> coldhead: yes.. this was.. thanks!
[04:03:46] <coldhead> you are welcome!
[04:11:54] <alaing> des anybody here have experience with embedding videos into their pages

[04:14:16] <alaing> While i have quiet a lot of videos that I would like to add to my site. They are mainly in .mov and avi format. I wondered what the best method was for encoding and any good plugins to enable the user to play it. Ideally not flash based so my iphone/ipad users can what them too.
[04:14:50] <Zeddy> Is it possible to display a "loading" screen while loading the manifest file?

[04:33:36] <walid> hi guys
[04:34:00] <walid> i'm trying to implement a lightbox in my wordpress blog, but i get an error in the lightbox.js
[04:34:02] <walid>     element.style.width = w +"px"; lightbox.js:33Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'width' of undefined
[04:34:27] <walid> any clue?
[04:34:37] <walid> is there a typo in this line?
[04:43:04] <Patatouf> hi, i still have a problem with my $.ajax function. I get an answer with an error saying that i passed "_" as a parameter. $ajax may have add this parameter automatically. How can i configure it not to do that ?
[04:46:14] <ShawnRisk> how do I make an accordion for this http://friendsofglendon.ca/sites/FoG/contact-us the fields  at the bottom starting with Note to the Friends?  I have read on the web lots, but no luck.  The code is here: http://friendsofglendon.ca/sites/FoG/sites/all/themes/js/accordion.js
[04:47:27] <coldhead> Patatouf: you can check with firebug or web inspector to see exactly what is being passed
[04:47:41] <Patatouf> coldhead: yes good idea
[04:47:44] <coldhead> i thought _ was related to caching and it was off by default
[04:51:09] <Engin> what was the kick ass online service to test html css js jquery (php too?) ?
[04:51:49] <Patatouf> coldhead: ok, i try (i dont see my request in firebug, i know it is executed though because i do an "alert" on success)
[04:53:49] <coldhead> Patatouf: make sure you have XHTTP request logging enabled
[04:53:56] <coldhead> via a right click in the console, usually
[04:54:05] <coldhead> then you'll see each request
[04:54:12] <coldhead> and clicking on it should show EVERYTHING
[04:55:28] <Patatouf> hmm i have a chat that make requests every 2 sec and i see the request :S
[04:55:50] <Patatouf> (right click doesnt do anything on mac, chrome)
[04:56:40] <coldhead> i don;'t know that combo sorry
[04:58:49] <ShawnRisk> seems no one can help me
[04:59:43] <Patatouf> coldhead: ok np. but would you have an idea where the '_' comes from ? I tested passing another random parameter and i have also an error with this random parameter. Therefore i am sure that ajax add a "_" parameter. I'd like to remove it
[04:59:45] <coldhead> ShawnRisk: the accordion gurus are still having their breakfast
[05:00:03] <ShawnRisk> oh really?
[05:00:35] <coldhead> ShawnRisk: check in with ajpiano when he's awake, he's my UI guru of choice
[05:00:40] <hrwath> they went to the street play some music to make money
[05:00:49] <hrwath> on their beautiful accordions
[05:00:53] <coldhead> Patatouf: like i said, it's probably to do with caching
[05:00:58] <coldhead> check http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[05:01:03] <coldhead> the cache option talks about _
[05:01:07] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: when he is normally awake?
[05:01:13] <coldhead> any minute now
[05:01:16] <coldhead> ?time ajpiano
[05:01:17] <oDesk> misterm: i've gaveup on this problem will run it on iframe
[05:01:17] <bot-t> coldhead, New York, NY - Time: 8:01 Wednesday (EDT), Weather: Sunny, 23°C / 73°F
[05:01:19] <pngl> Is there an equivalent of the ajax complete callback, but which would be run *before* success and error?
[05:01:44] <Patatouf> coldhead: this is the code http://pastebin.com/kDDP7NZX. The url works from the navigator.  And ok, i'm reading this page
[05:01:47] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: you don't know yourself?
[05:01:56] <Woet> pngl: then when should it run? just put your code right after the ajax call?
[05:02:04] <coldhead> i am very new to jQuery sorry ShawnRisk
[05:02:15] <ShawnRisk> that is okay
[05:02:16] <coldhead> and i have hardly touched UI and accordions and such
[05:02:17] <pngl> Woet: no, it has to be run after the response has been received
[05:02:34] <Woet> pngl: okay, then whats wrong with success/error?
[05:02:39] <Woet> ?ask @ pngl
[05:02:40] <bot-t> pngl, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:02:42] <hrwath> pngl, beforeSend?
[05:02:57] <pngl> Woet: code duplication
[05:03:05] <Woet> pngl: Describe the goal, not the step
[05:03:10] <oDesk> misterm: but then when the ajax response from the function in iframe assigned to a div into the window.parent.document,  the response appears into the loaded div, but the script tag which is into the response doesn't evaluated
[05:04:07] <burg> if i have any selector: $('tag-here') , how can i get the text from that tag? not just the innerhtml, with .html() , but the tag itself too
[05:04:14] <Woet> ?w same origin @ coldhead
[05:04:15] <bot-t> coldhead, Same origin policy - In computing, the same origin policy is an important security concept for a number of browser-side programming languages, such as JavaScript. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[05:05:22] <pngl> Woet: the request is attached to an object. Before sending it, I set this.current_request = jqXHR, and after receiving the response, I want to set this.current_request = null. The success and error callback in turn call methods that need current_request to be null to execute properly. So I want to set this.current_request = null in a callback that happens after the request is complete, but before success and error are called.
[05:05:25] <Patatouf> coldhead: i agree it seems to be related to "cache". But setting cache to false don't erase "_" parameter :(
[05:05:29] <keystr0k> Am I doing something wrong here: $('a.bef-toggle').prependTo($(this).next());
[05:05:41] <keystr0k> I want to move an a tag into the div that is on the line below it
[05:05:46] <oDesk> all my ajax responses which has some scripts into it, and it all works well, only this response which is being loaded from the ajax response which is into the iframe, it's script does not run
[05:05:47] <Woet> Patatouf: do you think he's coding on api.dailymotion.com? i don't think so.
[05:06:17] <Patatouf> Woet: I know he doesnt. But the problem comes from $.ajax that add the '_' parameter
[05:06:34] <Woet> Patatouf: i'm pretty sure the problem is because his browser refuses to do cross origin requests.
[05:06:35] <oDesk> pngl: do you want to do  this.current_request.abort()  ?
[05:06:49] <pngl> oDesk: no.
[05:06:51] <Woet> pngl: success: function(){ this.current_request = null; // All other code }
[05:06:54] <Woet> why wouldn't that work?
[05:06:54] <Patatouf> Woet: no it works well with youtube
[05:07:24] <Patatouf> Woet: and it's my issue, not his issue :)
[05:07:34] <muzone> I'm trying to use http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#radio - but look at all the shitload of CSS I have to include for it to work - http://jsfiddle.net/TKr3k/ - is there a quick way to delete everything I don't need, or do I have to use Firebug to disable one line at a time and see if it affects my radio buttons? Fuck!
[05:07:36] <Woet> oh, okay, i didn't notice that
[05:07:53] <pngl> Woet: it works. That's what I'm doing now. I also have error: function() { this.current_request = null; }. This code duplication. This is why I was looking for a callback that prepends both success and error.
[05:08:06] <Patatouf> Woet: but i just found the solution ! i had to set cache to true :(
[05:09:48] <Woet> pngl: i only know 'complete', but that's after success/error
[05:10:44] <Woet> pngl: maybe dataFilter?
[05:11:34] <pngl> Woet: no. this prevents jQuery's native parsing of the XMLHttpResponse.
[05:11:47] <Woet> then i don't know :)
[05:14:07] <z3yo> How to get the "title" of a ui dialog ?
[05:16:43] <ShawnRisk> seems ajpiano is not on :P
[05:19:03] <z3yo> How to add an attribute to an elements ??
[05:19:20] <aaronmcadam> plugin for that :D
[05:20:14] <StyXLT> hi, is it possible to load the whole tab widget with ajax? I'm using fancybox so that when a user does something the fancybox is triggered with tabs widget, but doesn't seem to work, just the text is there
[05:22:07] <aaronmcadam> have you tried using fancybox's callbacks
[05:22:09] <sadmicrowave> StyXLT, are you talking about putting the tab widget initiator in the success callback?
[05:22:11] <aaronmcadam> beforeShow i think?
[05:22:34] <aaronmcadam> should be able to init tabs in that surely
[05:22:49] <ShawnRisk> now all my accordion groups are slideUp when I click them, and doesn't keep open.
[05:22:50] <coldhead> keep asking your question patiently, ShawnRisk, someone will know
[05:23:21] <aaronmcadam> that's a nice feature ShawnRisk :D
[05:23:33] <rethus1> how can i get the buttomPnae to 0px open (http://jsfiddle.net/gydzc/1/) ?
[05:23:40] <rethus1> its the split-plugin
[05:24:06] <StyXLT> aaronmcadam yeah, that's what i needed, silly me
[05:24:07] <z3yo>  <aaronmcadam> plugin for that :D << it's for my case ?
[05:24:08] <StyXLT> thanks
[05:24:08] <ShawnRisk> aaronmcadam: have you done this done?
[05:24:28] <muzone> *AIRHOOOOORN*
[05:24:29] <muzone> I'm trying to use http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#radio - but look at all the shitload of CSS I have to include for it to work - http://jsfiddle.net/TKr3k/
[05:24:29] <aaronmcadam> StyXLT, does it work?
[05:24:32] <muzone> I tried using Firebug to extract only what's needed but it didn't go so well - http://jsfiddle.net/WpYqy/
[05:24:35] <muzone> Do I have to disable line by line manually? Fuck!
[05:24:45] <aaronmcadam> you're crazy muzone
[05:25:09] <muzone> why's that aaronmcadam?
[05:25:23] <aaronmcadam> are u trying to customise the theming of a ui widget
[05:25:55] <muzone> aaronmcadam: I'm trying to get my radios to look like "CHOOSE A SIZE" at http://www.theoutnet.com/product/217611
[05:25:59] <aaronmcadam> z3yo i was taking the piss
[05:26:05] <aaronmcadam> what was it you wanteD?
[05:26:16] <keystr0k> How can I move an <a> into the next <div> in the dom (they're siblings)â€¦ I cannot for the life of me get this to work
[05:26:53] <aaronmcadam> div.append( $(this).prev() ) maybe
[05:26:57] <muzone> aaronmcadam?
[05:27:32] <aaronmcadam> right
[05:27:36] <aaronmcadam> and why are u using ui?
[05:28:04] <muzone> aaronmcadam: I didn't know of any other way
[05:28:10] <muzone> aaronmcadam: is it possible to use jquery only?
[05:28:24] <muzone> yeah, now that you mention it, why the hell am i using UI
[05:28:26] <aaronmcadam> that's a simple effect
[05:28:37] <aaronmcadam> #sizes.script-loaded input {
[05:28:37] <aaronmcadam>     left: -9999px;
[05:28:37] <aaronmcadam>     position: absolute;
[05:28:39] <aaronmcadam> }
[05:28:48] <aaronmcadam> all they're doing is hiding the actual radio
[05:28:54] <keystr0k> aaronmcadam: I wish that worked :(
[05:28:56] <aaronmcadam> and using the same id
[05:29:00] <aaronmcadam> on the label
[05:29:09] <keystr0k> I'll keep working at it.
[05:29:10] <aaronmcadam> or actually not in this case
[05:29:10] <keystr0k> :(
[05:29:31] <aaronmcadam> just programmatically checking the right radio button on clicking
[05:29:33] <aaronmcadam> very simple
[05:29:39] <rethus1> here a bit cleaner in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/gydzc/2/

[05:29:54] <pateln541> Hi..I want to fix the popup window in the center of the main window (I use fancybox window) ..because it moves to top when I click on submit button....Any help?
[05:29:58] <rethus1> i try to get the red-pane (bottom-pane) closed at startup...
[05:30:02] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ keystr0k
[05:30:02] <bot-t> keystr0k, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:30:13] <rethus1> if click in the middle of the toggle, bottom-pane should resize to 50%
[05:30:19] <rethus1> if click again closing
[05:30:29] <rethus1> any Idea, why this doesnt work here?
[05:30:46] <rethus1> this is the jquery-file: http://krikus.com/js/splitter/splitter.js

[05:31:16] <molavy> i have somting like this :{"errs": {"body": "<ul class=\"errorlist\"><li>This field is required.</li></ul>", "type": "<ul class=\"errorlist\"><li>Value u&#39;2&#39; is not a valid choice.</li></ul>", "title": "<ul class=\"errorlist\"><li>This field is required.</li></ul>"}}
[05:31:16] <muzone> aaronmcadam: So you recommend doing it exactly like The Outnet then?
[05:31:22] <molavy> i want select element like id_body id_tittle and id_type and set red border
[05:31:25] <aaronmcadam> it's simple dude
[05:31:28] <molavy> my problem is when i use this code for (i in responseData.errs) $("id_"+responseData.errs[i]).css(border-color","red")
[05:31:31] <aaronmcadam> I've done something like that myself
[05:31:36] <molavy> responseData.errs[i]  return This field is required and not body or type and title
[05:32:03] <muzone> aaronmcadam: Not to me baby girl
[05:32:06] <keystr0k> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/mzNkr/
[05:32:11] <muzone> aaronmcadam: I barely know my way around JavaScript
[05:32:14] <ShawnRisk> any help on mine would be nice
[05:32:17] <aaronmcadam> not good
[05:32:21] <keystr0k> I just want to move a.bef-toggle into div.bef-checkboxes
[05:32:22] <muzone> aaronmcadam: I'll pay you if you help me out
[05:32:26] <molavy> any idea?
[05:32:34] <aaronmcadam> right keystr0k what exactly do u want
[05:32:35] <muzone> keystr0k, ShawnRisk and molavy just wants you for your body
[05:32:41] <aaronmcadam> muzone no sir, no donations on here
[05:32:51] <ShawnRisk> muzone: gross
[05:33:00] <aaronmcadam> you're here to learn, not to have peopel do ur work for u
[05:33:04] <keystr0k> aaronmcadam: I just want to move a.bef-toggle into div.bef-checkboxes
[05:33:25] <aaronmcadam> any reason?
[05:33:26] <keystr0k> I've tried prepend and prependTo (correcting syntax for each) with no luck.
[05:33:37] <keystr0k> It seems that "$(this)" isn't working or something
[05:33:38] <roger_padactor> so f'ing weird. Im using tinymce with jquery. I have a div that has text it in.  If I grab its html place it in the tinymce editor then save it back to that div it places the content in the div as html. I see the html script.  If the div is empty before hand and I add text it doesn't show the html code and renders it fine.  I'm baffled.
[05:33:50] <molavy> no idea?
[05:34:37] <molavy> there is no idea?
[05:34:48] <aaronmcadam> keystr0k, http://jsfiddle.net/mzNkr/2/
[05:35:30] <aaronmcadam> yeah, there /is/ no idea
[05:35:41] <keystr0k> aaronmcadam: thanksâ€¦ I suppose I neglected to mention there will be more than one of these "a followed by div.bef-checkboxes"
[05:36:00] <aaronmcadam> ok
[05:36:02] <keystr0k> I've gotten where you are and then I realized it's moving the element into each of the instances of .bef-checkboxes.
[05:36:03] <keystr0k> sorry
[05:36:05] <keystr0k> :(
[05:36:11] <keystr0k> I should have explained better.
[05:36:17] <aaronmcadam> i'm still confused
[05:36:18] <aaronmcadam> lol
[05:36:33] <aaronmcadam> why are you movin them anyway
[05:36:47] <aaronmcadam> you don't have control over the markup?
[05:36:58] <keystr0k> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/mzNkr/3/
[05:37:19] <aaronmcadam> ??
[05:37:33] <aaronmcadam> what do u want?
[05:38:01] <aaronmcadam> one Select All link?
[05:38:04] <keystr0k> well, the markup is defined in a Drupal module and I cannot hook in to alter itâ€¦ and I just need to move the link into the div that follows itâ€¦ for every occurrence of the combination (a followed by div)
[05:38:13] <keystr0k> One select all link at top of each div.bef-checkboxes
[05:38:15] <aaronmcadam> you want one link
[05:38:17] <aaronmcadam> k
[05:38:26] <keystr0k> one at top of each...
[05:38:45] <keystr0k> just moving the a tag into its next sibling div
[05:38:52] <keystr0k> (sorry to ramble on)
[05:39:19] <bateman> query: let's say you've got a div containing a bit of text and a span. how do you select ONLY the text with jquery?
[05:39:22] <aaronmcadam> right i see
[05:41:32] <ShawnRisk> weird how this is not working out for me
[05:42:09] <aaronmcadam> keystr0k, gimme a min i'm writin something for u

[06:52:12] <seutje> Ely2: I don't think you're being vague enough there
[06:52:56] <Ely2> i know :
[06:52:57] <Ely2> :p
[06:53:02] <Ely2> was froma guy that had some nice plugins
[06:53:06] <matjas> â™¡ seutje
[06:53:07] <matjas> that is all
[06:53:18] <bjhaid1> i get this json: data  Object { exten_id="7003",  cid_number="7003"}, which i view from firebug, if i try alert(data.exten_id); this works, but with the jquery-ui loaded in the DOM, if i try data.exten_id.dialog(); this doesnt work why?
[06:53:23] <Ely2> including own CSS font
[06:53:29] <limpc> ShawnRisk?
[06:53:47] <ajpiano> bjhaid1, why would you even think that *would* work?
[06:53:53] <seutje> matjas: wai empty heart? here, have a full one! â™¥
[06:53:57] <ajpiano> .dialog() is not a method of a string
[06:53:58] <kborchers> bjhaid1: that isn't how dialog works read the doc http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[06:54:03] <ShawnRisk> limpc: When I click the link, the slider slides Up not Down.
[06:54:16] <bjhaid1> ajpiano: i need to call tostring on it?
[06:54:18] <seutje> matjas: lolwtf?
[06:54:28] <ajpiano> bjhaid1, no... it already is a string
[06:54:33] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: what is wrong with the code I am using now?  I tried that accordion ui with no luck
[06:54:37] <ajpiano> if you want to use it as a selector to call dialog
[06:54:44] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: link?
[06:54:47] <ShawnRisk> ajpiano: you are alive
[06:54:54] <ajpiano> you have ot do like $("#"+data.exten_id).dialog()
[06:54:56] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: code or live?
[06:54:59] <ajpiano> ShawnRisk: yeah
[06:55:00] <kborchers> either way
[06:55:13] <limpc> oh thats a different issue than mine then
[06:55:15] <ajpiano> all morning i was hoping that someone would save some basic debugging of their own code for me!!
[06:55:17] <seutje> always feel nasty when I do that
[06:55:22] <limpc> mine claims accordion() isnt a function heh
[06:55:28] <ajpiano> lol "claims"
[06:55:37] <ajpiano> limpc: you probably have not included jquery ui properly
[06:55:40] <seutje> ajpiano: I get "object expected" in IE, please halp! :P
[06:55:41] <limpc> yeah claims cuz im loading jquery and jqueryui
[06:55:45] <bjhaid1> ajpiano: please i am confused
[06:55:54] <limpc> ajpiano, i see both in firebug
[06:56:07] <ajpiano> limpc: console.log($.fn.accordion)
[06:56:17] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: http://friendsofglendon.ca/sites/FoG/contact-us  there should be three fields at the bottom starting with Note to the Friends
[06:56:19] <ajpiano> seutje: GOT OBJECT OBJECT IN MY JAQUERIES
[06:56:33] <limpc> hmm says undefined.
[06:56:34] <seutje> ajpiano: LAIK A BAWS!
[06:56:35] <Camer0n> why won't the next and prev buttons work here: http://vermilionsite.com/v2/jQuery%20Slider/ ??
[06:56:47] <limpc> how can that be? i see the jqueryui file in the scripts list in firebug?
[06:56:56] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: i thought you said you were trying UI accordion?
[06:56:57] <Ely2> damnit why don't I have the site anymore
[06:57:14] <ajpiano> limpc: and when you open that file in the scripts list, does it actually contain jquery ui
[06:57:19] <limpc> yes
[06:57:21] <ajpiano> bjhaid1, there's nothing to "please" me about
[06:57:26] <ajpiano> go read the documentation for how the ui dialog works
[06:57:28] <limpc> jquery UI 1.8.14
[06:57:29] <ajpiano> and how... jquery works.
[06:57:46] <ajpiano> limpc: are you by any chance accidentally including jQuery again *after* you include jQuery UI ?
[06:57:56] <ajpiano> which would blow away the jquery which has been extended by jQuery UI?
[06:57:58] <yuvraj> hello all
[06:58:04] <yuvraj> i need a simple help
[06:58:06] <Camer0n> oh i see, dont worry
[06:58:10] <seutje> Camer0n: got a syntax error there, mate
[06:58:17] <limpc> im including jquerytools and colorbox, would either of those conflict with jqueryui?
[06:58:24] <yuvraj> i am implementing a simple jqgrid into my project
[06:58:32] <Camer0n> yeah, i see it, i had two ('blahs')
[06:58:35] <yuvraj> http://www.trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/jqgrid.html
[06:58:36] <Camer0n> lol
[06:58:37] <kborchers> limpc: jquerytools, yuck :p
[06:58:39] <ajpiano> limpc: check to see if your jquery tools distro also includes a full copy of jQuery
[06:58:43] <seutje> Camer0n: $('#s1').cycle('fade')({ <- that fade needs to go in the object methinks
[06:58:49] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: I did try that once didn't work out.  Reload.  This way is the closest I got to working.
[06:58:53] <yuvraj> but i cant implemented it sucessfully
[06:59:01] <Camer0n> yeah it was just $('#s1').cycle({
[06:59:09] <yuvraj> i want to develope a project`s admin panel using .net frame work
[06:59:11] <limpc> yep looks like it does
[06:59:16] <limpc> that must be the issue. gonna remove and see
[06:59:19] <bdone> is it possible to use an attribute selector like [rel="myvalue"], but also using context? like this http://pastebin.com/J0XANZpq?
[06:59:20] <ajpiano> limpc: yeah so that is what's going on
[06:59:21] <Camer0n> i had an array too, which wouldnt work!
[06:59:28] <ajpiano> stupid jQuery tools
[06:59:35] <yuvraj> how can i do this
[06:59:42] <yuvraj> i search a lot for the help on google
[06:59:50] <yuvraj> but cant find any good examples
[07:00:01] <ShawnRisk> ajpiano: would you have any ideas on my problem?
[07:00:16] <ajpiano> my advice would be to ping me every minute or two
[07:00:17] <yuvraj> so guys and gals if you implemented this things in your past then please help me
[07:00:23] <ajpiano> to make sure that i can't make a demo and debug your problem
[07:00:32] <ajpiano> :D
[07:00:58] <ajpiano> tng: don't do that.
[07:01:01] <tng> sorry :(
[07:01:03] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[07:01:04] <seutje> lol
[07:01:10] <seutje> hey, u asked for it....
[07:01:14] <ajpiano> did you just DCC chat invite the whole channel???
[07:01:25] <tng> i did what?
[07:01:30] <seutje> u don't ignore that shit?
[07:01:38] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano, ahhh i hate jQuery Tools
[07:01:39] <ajpiano> i declined it
[07:01:42] <limpc> that fixed it. thanks ajpiano
[07:01:54] <cesconix> obj = { hello:'world', foo: this.hello } why don't work 'foo' ??
[07:01:55] <tng> missclick -.- my bad
[07:02:03] <ajpiano> limpc:  no problem, the important thing is do you understand the nature of the problem :)
[07:02:11] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: that accordion.js is ugly. let me see if i can write it a little better. might be a few minutes
[07:02:15] <aaronmcadam> ?eval obj = { hello:'world', foo: this.hello } obj.foo
[07:02:16] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[07:02:19] <yuvraj> can any one help me plz
[07:02:31] <aaronmcadam> ?eval var obj = { hello:'world', foo: this.hello }; obj.foo
[07:02:32] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: undefined
[07:02:33] <cesconix> aaronmcadam, dont work
[07:02:41] <seutje> can't use something while ur defining it
[07:02:44] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: thanks
[07:02:48] <aaronmcadam> ah of course
[07:02:53] <ajpiano> yuvraj: we help people with specific issues and problems here, not "i want to implement this plugin on [my app], please help"
[07:02:55] <aaronmcadam> ?eval var obj = { hello:'world', foo: 'meeee' }; obj.foo
[07:02:56] <seutje> can't live in a house while ur building it
[07:02:56] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: "meeee"
[07:03:12] <aaronmcadam> cesconix, see, it can't find this.hello
[07:03:20] <cesconix> ok :(
[07:03:27] <aaronmcadam> scoping issue probably
[07:03:34] <aaronmcadam> are u inside an ajax callback perchance?
[07:03:49] <limpc> ajpiano, yep. just never thought a jquery extension could include the entire jquery core. kind of stupid
[07:03:59] <ajpiano> limpc: yeah, it's pretty dumb
[07:04:10] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano, it happens an awful lot, just get people expecting ya to wade through loads of code unrelated to their problem :D
[07:04:14] <limpc> but i was loading jquerytools via their cdn. so didnt really have any options. now im using a custom build without jquery
[07:04:23] <cesconix> aaronmcadam, nono is a options config array
[07:04:38] <aaronmcadam> jquerytools suckkkks
[07:04:55] <aaronmcadam> it's API is sooo crap
[07:07:05] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ cesconix
[07:07:06] <bot-t> cesconix, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:08:28] <_dave_h_d> hi everyone does anyone know how to use variable variables with objects so i have: myobject.someproperty.variablepassedinfunction (the variablepassedinfunction is the name of the property i am trying to access.
[07:09:01] <tbranyen> _dave_h_d: use hash notation
[07:09:04] <tbranyen> obj[name]
[07:09:32] <_dave_h_d> tbranyen: so myobject.someproperty[variablepassedinfunction]
[07:09:39] <tbranyen> _dave_h_d: sure
[07:09:49] <_dave_h_d> tbranyen: i think it does not work
[07:10:16] <tbranyen> _dave_h_d: i think you need to make a jsfiddle showing it doesn't work
[07:10:19] <tbranyen> then i'll believe u
[07:10:51] <_dave_h_d> sorry tbranyen it does
[07:10:54] <ajpiano> lol i also look forward to a fiddle showing that bracket not...
[07:10:57] <ajpiano> aww, letdown.
[07:11:09] <_dave_h_d> but that is the first thing i tried (long day)
[07:11:21] <_dave_h_d> thank you anyway
[07:11:27] <tbranyen> :)
[07:11:32] <tbranyen> major let down
[07:11:36] <cesconix> aaronmcadam, http://jsfiddle.net/4SjW5/ <-- is incomplete
[07:11:42] <cesconix> look "this.tag"
[07:12:48] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: any luck?
[07:13:15] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: patience is a virtue ;) was just about to post this http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/fTK52/
[07:13:35] <ajpiano> patience is a virtue, impatience feels really awesome
[07:13:41] <_dave_h_d> tbranyen: can you then do: myobject.someproperty[variablepassedinfunction].hasOwnProperty(x) etc ?
[07:13:53] <kborchers> take that js and drop it inside the $(document).ready of your accordion.js and it should work
[07:14:22] <ShawnRisk> ?down jsfiddle.net
[07:14:25] <kborchers> jsfiddle is reeeeaaaallllyyyyy sssslllllooooowwww today
[07:14:29] <bot-t> ShawnRisk, It's not just you! - http://jsfiddle.net looks down from here.
[07:14:57] <aaronmcadam> cesconix, what's this in this context?
[07:15:15] <aaronmcadam> the variable slider doesn't have a "tag" property
[07:15:26] <aaronmcadam> ahh
[07:15:40] <aaronmcadam> hang on
[07:16:16] <aaronmcadam> cesconix, http://jsfiddle.net/4SjW5/2/
[07:16:20] <aloiscochard> hello all, I'm using datatables with tabletools, but unfortunatly tabletools didn't work as expected are you aware of a possible altrernative ?
[07:16:41] <aloiscochard> need to print table (export to csv nice to have)
[07:17:46] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: I just tried your code, and this isn't working the same as on jsfiddle you posted.
[07:18:11] <aaronmcadam> not sure how to make that work cesconix
[07:18:27] <aaronmcadam> not sure if it's possible
[07:18:32] <aaronmcadam> anyone else?
[07:18:45] <cesconix> no aaronmcadam
[07:18:51] <aaronmcadam> http://jsfiddle.net/4SjW5/3/
[07:18:53] <cesconix> sto provando diversamente
[07:18:55] <cesconix> ops
[07:18:56] <aaronmcadam> http://jsfiddle.net/4SjW5/5/
[07:19:00] <cesconix> i try another way
[07:19:26] <aaronmcadam> ?translate sto provando diversamente
[07:19:27] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Translation (Italian -> English) - I'm trying a different
[07:19:33] <aaronmcadam> ok cool
[07:19:38] <aaronmcadam> i want to know myself tho
[07:19:49] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: any other ideas you have?
[07:19:49] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: is it up on your site?
[07:19:55] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: yep
[07:20:12] <aaronmcadam> guys, in an obj literal, is it possible to refer to other properties within the block?
[07:20:18] <aaronmcadam> like here http://jsfiddle.net/4SjW5/5/
[07:20:26] <aaronmcadam> the html.element property
[07:20:59] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam, no you can't do that
[07:21:07] <aaronmcadam> didn't think so
[07:21:29] <aaronmcadam> because the literal hasn't actually been defined yet
[07:21:46] <ajpiano> ye
[07:22:27] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: you need the $(document).ready(function() { ... }); around that code i gave you
[07:22:42] <kborchers> it was in you accordion.js file before
[07:23:06] <ajpiano> you said to replace it kborchers, it's your fault for breaking his code
[07:23:09] <quicksilver> aaronmcadam: plain values don't have "this".
[07:23:19] <quicksilver> aaronmcadam: function bodies have "this" available.
[07:23:35] <kborchers> ajpiano: [09:13] <kborchers> take that js and drop it inside the $(document).ready of your accordion.js and it should work
[07:23:39] <Engin> js/close
[07:23:42] <Engin> oops
[07:23:46] <ajpiano> kborchers: i'm just taking the piss ;)
[07:23:46] <Engin> ba byee
[07:24:16] <callumacrae> I suspect that by code is horribly inefficient, could someone take a look at it and tell me how to improve it? https://github.com/callumacrae/phpbb3/commit/6cfc3866a65245e5ca53759723a27ff00967f2f6#L3R319
[07:24:20] <callumacrae> my code*
[07:24:38] <ShawnRisk> ajpiano: this is my fault, I should have known about that.  I am trying now
[07:25:04] <aloiscochard> datatables is fantastic, but tabletools really sucks... will do it by hand
[07:25:29] <aaronmcadam> yeah quicksilver i was just clarifying something for cesconix :)
[07:25:47] * quicksilver nods
[07:25:49] <aaronmcadam> It would be nice to able to refer to other properties though
[07:25:52] <kggle_> i use $('ul', this).show() but it also shows the sub uls, how to i get just the first level ul?
[07:26:05] <aaronmcadam> but obviously how the hell would u parse it haha
[07:26:20] <quicksilver> aaronmcadam: it's not a problem in theory - lots of languages permit recursive values.
[07:26:30] <quicksilver> aaronmcadam: it's a problem with javascripts immediate evaluation model though
[07:26:47] <quicksilver> this.html.class doesn't even exist at the point you would try to refer to it
[07:26:53] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: try to close the first one there is a weird effect.
[07:26:54] <quicksilver> even supposing 'this' worked in the first place.
[07:27:07] <ajpiano> 'this' does work on a plain object, quicksilver
[07:27:22] <quicksilver> ajpiano: hence "even supposing it worked"
[07:27:42] <quicksilver> ajpiano: (you can obviously call methods on plain objects in a way which makes 'this' work though)
[07:27:54] <ajpiano> yeah
[07:27:58] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: i can't reload your site
[07:28:19] <cesconix> aaronmcadam, quicksilver, thanks :)
[07:28:33] <muzone> I'm trying to turn my radio labels into buttons like under "CHOOSE A SIZE" at http://www.theoutnet.com/product/217611 - but at http://jsfiddle.net/97VBy/ - how come .button:active won't work?
[07:28:37] <muzone> Here's a little something for the trouble: http://soundcloud.com/flyinglotus/flying-lotus-massive-attack
[07:29:00] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: it is a bit slow.  Try again
[07:32:01] <muzone> *AIRHOOOOORN*
[07:32:14] <muzone> Anybody know how to make http://jsfiddle.net/97VBy/ act like "CHOOSE A SIZE" at http://www.theoutnet.com/product/217611 ?
[07:33:20] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: hmmm, not sure why it's doing that
[07:34:17] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: weird effect
[07:34:27] <Camer0n> when using the pager herE: http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/int2.html how can i make the buttons images rather than numbers??
[07:37:06] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: can we prevent people from closing the same one?
[07:38:10] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: trying to go about it a different way, just a min
[07:38:14] <ShawnRisk> ok
[07:40:09] <Camer0n> anyone have ay ideas?
[07:41:34] <shesek> hana
[07:41:41] * kborchers gives jsfiddle some coffee
[07:43:57] <Camer0n> anyonnee??
[07:45:07] <Brklyn> hi guys, this isn't really a jquery question as such, but I figured perhaps some of you may know what the problem is.... I am using jquery to open an overlay, and I'm loading a google map within this overlay. Everything works fine the first time I open the overlay, but the subsequent times I close and open the overlay, the map just doesn't render correctly
[07:45:10] <Brklyn> any hints?
[07:45:54] <Camer0n> dont worry, if found it
[07:46:38] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: ok, let's try this one http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/fTK52/2/
[07:48:59] <kinesis> Hey my site at www.ocpro.com has Javascript that makes the text fade in, I installed a hashchange event plugin in jQuery (check it out http://www.ocpro.com ) and when you click "Experience & Qualifiations" the fadetext() doesn't work. how do i get it to work for every link I click?
[07:50:48] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: just tried that and two problems I see.  1.) If I click any of them to open it closes right away.  2.) I still getting the overlay, when I try to open any for the second time.
[07:50:59] <kinesis> nevermind i fixed it
[07:51:37] <kborchers> kinesis: just out of curiousity, is that bg image from Hackers?
[07:53:30] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: hmmm, do you have any other elements on that page with the fieldset-wrapper class? there has to be something else going on with the page cuz it works fine in jsfiddle
[07:55:24] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: in your site search, you use that class again. that is going to cause issues
[07:55:54] <t4nkd> Hey jQ -- can someone take a look at this screenshot and tell me what kind of plugin I could use to shorten up the implementation? I know I could build it myself but, why reinvent the wheel and all: https://skitch.com/jpeasy/fcdf6/untitled
[07:56:51] <sadmicrowave> t4nkd, you want to change the content of a div when another div is clicked?
[07:57:20] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: looking
[07:57:32] <t4nkd> Kinda, yeah, replace I think is more like it
[07:57:37] <Aple> ShawnRisk++
[07:57:49] <t4nkd> But also append an "active" class to the clicked div and all
[07:58:09] <Aple> Is there a way to change the target of jQuery Validate's error messages so it's not spawning them and breaking my layout??
[07:58:23] <t4nkd> I mean, I know I could write it from a handfull of jQ functions but why bother if someone has a library that already does it
[07:59:23] <ajpiano> t4nkd, i'm not sure there's a plugin that does exactly what you need here, you might just want to write the four or five lines of code
[07:59:34] <cbobo> Why would this not work in ie7; $('select#quizRegisterYear').val(myValue);
[07:59:43] <t4nkd> Meh, yeah, I guess I can
[07:59:52] <t4nkd> It seems like a slider, kinda
[07:59:55] <kborchers> Aple: check out http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate#toptions and look at the showErrors option
[07:59:57] <sadmicrowave> t4nkd, I don't know of a plugin for that, its pretty simple though. Just make separate content divs for all the different contents you have and display:none display:block between the button clicks
[08:00:03] <ajpiano> t4nkd: you'd spend the same amount of energy configuring the plugin
[08:00:12] <ajpiano> t4nkd ,if anything, it's a version of a tabbed interface
[08:00:21] <cbobo> Because in ie8 and ff, etc it works fine just not in ie7
[08:00:22] <t4nkd> Yeah, actually, that makes the most sense
[08:00:31] <t4nkd> but configuring tabs would probably be more of a pain
[08:00:35] <ajpiano> exactly :)
[08:00:47] <ajpiano> i was gonna say, if you find a plugin, you're gonna spend the same amount of mental energy configuring
[08:00:49] <cbobo> Is there a different way to auto select an option ?
[08:00:57] <ajpiano> normally i always advocate avoiding reinventing the wheel
[08:00:58] <t4nkd> Yeah I suppose I would :P
[08:01:17] <t4nkd> I got all the CSS done already anyway, might as well build a short function for the click event
[08:02:13] <b1lly> wheres the phtml file for the Top Links
[08:02:43] <ajpiano> b1lly: um. are you sure you're asking in the right channel?
[08:03:31] <JSM87> hi guys, is it possible to use jquery to fade/transition between various css background images e.g body {background-image:url();} ?
[08:03:55] <ajpiano> JSM87, you have to fade the entire element, you can't just fade its bg image
[08:04:12] <sasori> Help: how to save the ticked radio button's value without pressing any submit button ?  :(
[08:04:22] <sasori> i mean, the value should go to the database
[08:04:23] <JSM87> ajpiano: What about if I wanted it to change change (no effect)
[08:04:37] <JSM87> e.g flick through maybe 5 backgrounds, every 10 seconds
[08:04:42] <kborchers> ?change @ sasori
[08:04:42] <bot-t> sasori, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[08:04:47] <kborchers> ?click @ sasori
[08:04:48] <bot-t> sasori, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[08:04:50] <ajpiano> JSM87: very easy, just call .css("background-image", "url(whatever.png)");
[08:04:52] <kborchers> ?ajax @ sasori
[08:04:52] <bot-t> sasori, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[08:04:55] <cbobo> does the SELECT selector not work in ie7 ?
[08:05:07] <sasori> 1 sec..lemme show the code
[08:05:13] <JSM87> ajpiano: Ok thats simply enough. ok, going back to fade effect, how can I achieve this without having to fade the entire page?
[08:05:14] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: I took out the fieldset-wrapper for that page.  Still the problems are happening to me.  Any further ideas?
[08:05:16] <Cork[home]> JSM87: don't forget that you most likly have to preload those images though
[08:05:23] <ajpiano> JSM87: here's an example of fade effect between images or images and text http://jsbin.com/ozuzo4/13
[08:05:24] <JSM87> Yes true
[08:05:34] <cjordan> Hi everyone. I wanted to get some quick opinions on methodology. I've got a list of items on the left of my screen and clicking one should cause the data associated with that link to populate inside of an accordion.
[08:05:46] <kborchers> sasori: just bind to the change event of the radio and in that handler use ajax to post the value to a server side script that updates the db
[08:05:52] <JSM87> ajpiano: Yes thats exactly what I want, but for the whole body background
[08:06:06] <sasori> kborchers: http://pastebin.com/mjNKHMZs
[08:06:10] <ajpiano> yeah i'm not sure how you're gonna achieve that without fading out the entire body
[08:06:51] <cjordan> I'm doing this data population via Ajax, but should my Ajax call return the data and I should let the client render that data inside the accordion, or should I return fully formed HTML and then just plop it in each respective accordion section?
[08:07:23] <kborchers> sasori: your problem is that your setting your galleryMenuStyleVal var outside of the click event so it's not going to change when you click. put that inside the click handler
[08:07:41] <sasori> ok 1 sec..
[08:07:51] <ajpiano> cjordan: either way, you're requesting the data via ajax on click, right?
[08:08:03] <cjordan> ajpiano: yes
[08:08:26] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: are you going to be able to look at this again or are you busy?
[08:08:34] <ajpiano> so you're just asking if you should return it as html or as like, json, and do some htmlifying on the client side?
[08:08:39] <cjordan> I'm torn between the two solutions. Is it really "six of one, half-a-dozen of the other", sort of thing?
[08:08:42] <cbobo> Has anyone had any problems with doing something like $('select#myid').val(1); in ie7 /
[08:08:43] <cbobo> ?
[08:08:56] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: always busy but let me see ;) is it updated on your site?
[08:09:16] <cjordan> ajpiano: exactly. I started out returning JSON, but now I'm wondering if it really matters and I should just return the fully formed HTML...
[08:09:35] <ajpiano> cbobo: you would be a lot likelier to get help if you made a fiddle that shows your code failing in IE7
[08:09:46] <ajpiano> instead of just asking if anyone kinda sorta maybe knows what you're talking about
[08:10:14] <cbobo> made a fiddle? I am sorry I don not understand what a Fiddle is
[08:10:26] <cjordan> cobo: jsfiddle...
[08:10:27] <ajpiano> cjordan: i would probably prefer returning the fully formed html to avoid the client side processing
[08:10:34] <ajpiano> in the isolated case
[08:10:35] <kborchers> ?demo @ cbobo
[08:10:36] <bot-t> cbobo, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:10:47] <cbobo> okay second
[08:10:55] <ajpiano> if you had some kinda service where you were requsting that data to be reused in a variety of contextx, then i'd say do json, cjordan
[08:11:02] <cjordan> ajpiano: that's the way I'm leaning and for the same reason... I just kinda wanted to get a feel for how others felt about it.
[08:11:06] <Camer0n> if you look here: http://vermilionsite.com/v2/ I want the title under the banner to change with the image, how would i do that?
[08:11:46] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: everything is updated.
[08:12:39] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: taking forever to refresh again :/ my biggest complaint about drupal
[08:13:29] <cbobo> webpage that you suggested is slow, still loading :|
[08:13:46] <Camer0n> who, me?
[08:13:55] <cbobo> http://jsfiddle.net/ ; that one
[08:14:05] <Camer0n> oh
[08:14:09] <bjhaid1> hi please i have fizzled over this all day https://gist.github.com/1109447, when i replace line 7 with alert(a), it works but right now doesnt work, please what's wrong
[08:14:12] <Camer0n> anyone got any ideas???
[08:14:53] <sadmicrowave> bjhaid1, line 5 is invalid...you have ) without an (
[08:15:05] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: it is not drupal the site is just slow
[08:15:29] <cjordan> ajpiano: thanks. I think I'm going to return html. ;)
[08:15:39] <bjhaid1> sadmicrowave: that was a mistake, it still doesnt work, the data is a json object
[08:15:51] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: must be cuz it's in canada, eh? ;)
[08:16:17] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: maybe
[08:16:38] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: doubt that's it. just a bad joke
[08:17:28] <bjhaid1> sadmicrowave: any ideas please
[08:18:04] <Camer0n> anyone??????
[08:18:12] <cbobo> http://jsfiddle.net/ktmrt/
[08:18:14] <jeffsmykil> Is there a way to do if all children or an element are hidden
[08:18:18] <cbobo> here is my Fiddle
[08:18:40] <cbobo> works fine, in ie8,ie9,ff,chrome,etc
[08:18:42] <cbobo> but not in ie7
[08:19:09] <cbobo> basically, i am trying to auto select an option
[08:19:16] <DannyZB> Life's good !
[08:19:29] <jeffsmykil> cbobo: its been a while, but iirc theres something messed up with that in IE7
[08:19:37] <cbobo> it is very simple, one line of jq; however, it has a problem with working in ie7
[08:19:46] <jeffsmykil> you should find something with a google search of IE 7 select jquery
[08:19:49] <bjhaid1> i need help please https://gist.github.com/1109447
[08:20:07] <seutje> ?down jsfiddle.net
[08:20:14] <cbobo> So this is messed up in ie7?
[08:20:15] <bot-t> seutje, It's not just you! - http://jsfiddle.net looks down from here.
[08:20:16] <cbobo> dam
[08:20:19] <seutje> >NOOOOOOOES
[08:20:26] <jeffsmykil> cbobo i think there is a work around
[08:20:29] <jeffsmykil> i just cant remember
[08:21:08] <cbobo> ya i have been google searching and, they said to ask in here
[08:21:12] <cbobo> on the jq website
[08:22:39] <Cork[home]> bjhaid1: 1) you never asked any question, 2) your code doesn't parse
[08:22:58] <ajpiano> bjhaid1, go read some docs on how jQuery works
[08:23:05] <ajpiano> you can't call dialog on something that isn't a jQuery object
[08:23:10] <ajpiano> and you are doing exactly that.
[08:23:43] <bjhaid1> ajpiano: thanks, so i need to do jQuery.parseJson(a)
[08:23:48] <ajpiano> wow, no
[08:23:48] <bjhaid1> ajpiano: right?
[08:23:50] <crazydip> how can I interrupt / stop a $.post?
[08:23:51] <aaronmcadam> i love people who ask you to guess their problems :D
[08:24:06] <Cork[home]> crankharder: xhr.abort()
[08:24:08] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam, that's almost as good as people who just guess at their own problems
[08:24:11] <jeffsmykil> aaronmcadam:  my problem is bigger than a breadbox!
[08:24:17] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: will I don't get a lot of jokes
[08:24:21] <ajpiano> bjhaid1: what is "a"
[08:24:28] <aaronmcadam> haha yep
[08:24:41] <bjhaid1> ajpiano: a is an element of data which is a json object
[08:24:41] <richthegeek> hi - I'm trying to display a series of boxes in a grid, where each box can span any number of columns and is of arbitrary height. Similar to tables, but the number of columns is fixed (unlike tables) and the number of rows and differences in heights doesn't matter. Anyone know a good place to start or have some hints/advice/etc?
[08:24:57] <aaronmcadam> why no yayQueries? :( I still check for an episode you know :D
[08:25:01] <jeffsmykil> is there a way to count the number of visible children using length some how>
[08:25:04] <crazydip> Cork[home], thank you!
[08:25:11] <Cork[home]> crazydip: sorry that was for you ;P
[08:25:11] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam keep it on the DL but i think we're recording tomorrow ;)
[08:25:23] <aaronmcadam> woop :D I won't breathe a word :d
[08:25:28] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil $(this).children(":visible").length ?
[08:25:37] <jeffsmykil> that would probably work
[08:25:43] <bjhaid1> ajpiano: data is returned as a json object, the explanations on parsing is i aint sure, but when i ran it in alert it worked
[08:25:53] <ajpiano> bjhaid1, is it the ID of the element you want to turn into a dialog
[08:25:55] <aaronmcadam> are you on jqm at all ajpiano?
[08:25:56] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: i'm really not sure what's going on there as i can't reproduce it in jsfiddle. it works fine there
[08:25:59] <jeffsmykil> yup it does
[08:25:59] <ajpiano> or is it the content that you want to have be presenting in a dialog
[08:26:06] <jeffsmykil> thanks ajpiano once again you are my hero
[08:26:09] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam, i dabbled with it once
[08:26:18] <aaronmcadam> ah right, i wanna get involved with docs
[08:26:18] <bjhaid1> ajpiano: it is the content that i want to have be presenting in a dialog
[08:26:25] <aaronmcadam> talking to todd about it :)
[08:26:30] <bjhaid1> ajpiano: it is returned from a json
[08:26:41] <ajpiano> bjhaid1 try this: $("<div>").text(a).dialog();
[08:26:56] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: throwing in the towel?
[08:27:11] <ajpiano> bjhaid1 a jquery ui dialog is not like a normal alert, it doesn't just magically print a string, you have to have an actual dom element to render in the dialog
[08:27:15] <cesconix> aaronmcadam, http://jsbin.com/egipol
[08:27:48] <bjhaid1> ajpiano: you rock
[08:27:50] <bjhaid1> thanks alot
[08:27:51] <aaronmcadam> woh
[08:27:55] <ajpiano> <--- Iraq
[08:28:09] <aaronmcadam> I like to use the .first and .last methods instead of those "pseudo" selectors
[08:28:15] <bjhaid1> ajpiano: if i replace <div> with id would it work too?
[08:28:24] <ajpiano> bjhaid1 huh, no
[08:28:33] <ajpiano> you need DOM element to call dialog on
[08:28:57] <bjhaid1> ajpiano: thanks, how about if i want to abitrarily concat a string to it
[08:28:59] <krz> whats a better way of doing :eq(0)
[08:29:03] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: http://carphotos.cardomain.com/ride_images/4/716/1189/39288094010_large.jpg
[08:29:08] <ryanneufeld> iroc ?
[08:29:28] <ajpiano> bjhaid1 $("<div>").text(a + "Arbitrary String").dialog();
[08:29:35] <jeffsmykil> that looks like a demented game of qbert on the hood of that automobile
[08:29:43] <Cork[home]> krz: :first or .first, but its not exactly better, its about the same
[08:29:43] <bjhaid1> ajpiano: thanks GOD bless
[08:30:10] <ajpiano> cbobo: if i go here in IE7, http://jsfiddle.net/ktmrt/show/, it works just fine
[08:30:16] <ajpiano> welcome bjhaid1
[08:30:18] <aaronmcadam> is paul still maaaad busy ajpiano ?
[08:30:24] <ajpiano> we all mad busy
[08:30:40] <aaronmcadam> yeahhh, guess your ui stuff is taking a lot of time up
[08:31:11] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: 1.9 inching closer to RC?
[08:31:26] <ajpiano> inching :p
[08:31:35] <ajpiano> there'll probably be a bunch of stuff before an RC
[08:31:49] <aaronmcadam> I wonder if any of rebecca's stuff will be opened at all too
[08:31:53] <aaronmcadam> maybe not
[08:31:58] <Cork[home]> ajpiano: btw do you know why they removed the wiki plugin development summary page?
[08:32:05] <aaronmcadam> I did have an idea for a mobile app cms before tho :)
[08:32:06] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: here is one more small change. if that doesn't work you'll have to try to trace through your code to find what's causing the issue as i can't guess at what it is without a reduced case in a fiddle. just don't have time to figure out what is going on with all of your js in that page http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/fTK52/4/
[08:32:22] <ajpiano> Cork[home], you mean the old front page with the gigantic list of plugins
[08:32:22] <ajpiano> ?
[08:32:29] <Cork[home]> ya
[08:32:39] <ajpiano> yah we took that down caues it was confusing and misleading
[08:32:43] <Cork[home]> with info of where they where in planing
[08:32:48] <ajpiano> gave the impression we were working on WAY more than we were
[08:32:55] <Cork[home]> ah
[08:33:09] <ShawnRisk> ?down jsfiddle
[08:33:10] <aaronmcadam> hard to focus I'd say
[08:33:13] <bot-t> ShawnRisk, It's just you. - http://jsfiddle.com is up.
[08:33:19] <Cork[home]> now theres not really anywhere to find what happens though >_>
[08:33:20] <ajpiano> cause there was no delineation between "in planning" and "planning on it eventually being in planning" ;)
[08:33:22] <aaronmcadam> it's just being slow today
[08:33:31] <Cork[home]> except for the bug tracker though
[08:33:33] <aaronmcadam> haha
[08:33:33] <ajpiano> ShawnRisk: you can use jsbin as well
[08:33:43] <ajpiano> Cork[home]: you can also follow github, the changes on the wiki,
[08:34:00] <Cork[home]> hmm
[08:34:00] <ShawnRisk> ajpiano: okay
[08:35:00] <Cork[home]> ajpiano: you mean follow the commits?
[08:35:06] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: why is code worse than the first version?
[08:35:15] <ajpiano> yes
[08:36:10] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: not sure. go back to that version and start troubleshooting from there.
[08:36:31] <Cork[home]> was looking for something a bit more summerized
[08:37:19] <ajpiano> Cork[home], well, we have a jqueryui dev channel here on freenode, it's kinda quiet though, more for development
[08:37:32] <ajpiano> but if you want to ask questions and perhaps getting involved, could be a good spot ;)
[08:37:50] <cesconix> <aaronmcadam> I like to use the .first and .last methods instead of those "pseudo" selectors <--- I did not understand :\
[08:37:55] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: thanks for the help
[08:38:08] <Cork[home]> ajpiano: ya, was looking into it before, but work got the better of me
[08:38:11] <aaronmcadam> .first() instead of :first
[08:38:24] <ShawnRisk> since everyone said ajpiano knows lots, would you like to take this on?  I will be researching too just 2 heads are better than one?
[08:38:36] <aaronmcadam> think the methods are faster
[08:38:42] <ajpiano> ShawnRisk: i only help people who actually attempt to debug their own code
[08:38:57] <ajpiano> :p
[08:39:02] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano++
[08:39:11] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: good luck, hopefully that at least gets you in the right direction. you could always just switch to the UI accordion though you would need to change your html a bit
[08:39:16] <cesconix> aaronmcadam, sure?
[08:39:25] <aaronmcadam> there are some hopeless people who come in here
[08:39:53] <aaronmcadam> yeah I just find it easier to read and maintain that way cesconix
[08:40:05] <halcyon1234> Is there a way to fire an event each time the content of an iframe loads and reloads?  I was thinking $("#the_iframe").load(), but that only seems to catch when the frame itself is first loaded.
[08:40:07] <ajpiano> it's definitely more performant as well, cesconix
[08:40:24] <aaronmcadam> like this : $( selector that is an id ).find( something that may be a class ).first()
[08:40:34] <ShawnRisk> ajpiano: I do debug my own code, and have tried this before I came on here.
[08:41:05] <aaronmcadam> it's faster to grab an id first and then filter down
[08:41:14] <aaronmcadam> is that still right ajpiano?
[08:41:28] <aaronmcadam> addy did a good talk on it
[08:41:36] <ajpiano> i mean, sometimes yeah
[08:41:41] <cesconix> nice!
[08:41:44] <aaronmcadam> cesconix, http://addyosmani.com/blog/jquery-performance-tips-2011/
[08:41:46] <ajpiano> it's not like every time you do a selectoin you should definitely descend from an ID
[08:41:55] <aarjona> is it normal that when I use load() to get a page that has some external javascripts loaded via <script> those are ignored?
[08:42:21] <ajpiano> aarjona yep
[08:42:22] <ryanneufeld> ?load() @ aarjona
[08:42:22] <bot-t> aarjona, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/

[08:45:49] <aaronmcadam> Cork[home], this any use? http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/
[08:46:21] <Cork[home]> aaronmcadam: na, i have a local copy, was just lazy :)
[08:46:26] <aaronmcadam> tehee
[08:46:44] <Cork[home]> much help that got me though :s
[08:46:45] <aaronmcadam> _.isArray() :D
[08:48:21] <aaronmcadam> I'm gettin into underscore :)
[08:48:31] <ajpiano> woot
[08:48:37] <ajpiano> backbone/underscore is killer :D
[08:48:45] <aaronmcadam> yay :D
[08:48:50] <aaronmcadam> been using that with jqm
[08:48:52] <Aple> With .post, how do I load new pages AND pass vars along from previous pages? I've got a question-by-question (1 at a time) survey I'm trying to get working.
[08:48:59] <aaronmcadam> still only really using bbone views though
[08:49:16] <aaronmcadam> cuz the app doesn't really allow you to "create" things
[08:49:31] <aaronmcadam> as in "adding" things to the ui or anything
[08:49:53] <aaronmcadam> could really do with a good code review on it really
[08:51:24] <ajpiano> you're using backbone too or just underscroe
[08:51:50] <aaronmcadam> yeah both
[08:52:42] <aaronmcadam> just would be good to figure out if i should be using models or whatever u know
[08:52:47] <Vinny> what's better jQuery UI Widget Factory or jQuery's plugin development ?
[08:54:10] <Unode|Work> hi everyone
[08:55:48] <Unode|Work> In a function I have a string being generated which represents an <img> tag. Before returning the string, I want to make sure the image referred to by the src= attribute is actually loaded but not visible on the page. What is the best way to achieve this?
[08:56:21] <BMCouto> Hi, why does outerWidth() gives me an incorrect value of an element with opacity:0 ?
[08:57:11] <Vinny> Unode|Work: are these images dynamic?
[08:57:39] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano, do you know of any code review sites?
[08:57:45] <Unode|Work> Vinny, no, it's only loaded once and then inserted at a certain position
[08:57:55] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam: github :p
[08:58:01] <aaronmcadam> tehee :)
[08:58:12] <Unode|Work> Vinny, but I want to have the image ready on the function before reaching the scope where it's actually inserted in the final location
[08:58:14] <aaronmcadam> I could have sworn i came across one ages ago
[08:58:30] <crazydip> why does xhr.abort() not work while alert does using: var xhr = $.post(...).error( function(){ xhr.abort();alert("error); });
[08:58:42] <Vinny> Unode|Work: Hmm, i would say load the items behind the page on load, and then just reference them via your fn()
[08:59:42] <Vinny> ajpiano: Just read your UI Widget Factory slides, thanks a bunch, lol
[08:59:46] <Unode|Work> Vinny, is there any standard way of inserting an "img string" onto the document without a final location? i.e. to force the browse to load the image (src)
[08:59:54] <ajpiano> welcome Vinny
[09:00:40] <Unode|Work> Vinny, can I simply do $(img_string).load(...) ?
[09:01:33] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano, actually yeah, does the jquery team have code review sessions often?
[09:01:51] <aaronmcadam> for larger merges?
[09:02:14] <vifo> hey folks
[09:02:16] <aaronmcadam> or does the release manager sort them out
[09:02:58] <Vinny> Unode|Work: doesn't .load() involve you doing an ajax call? How it sounds is that your just doing something that would just load the image on the page, once its loaded its cached int the browser I would just reference that
[09:03:28] <vifo> how can i serialize/deserialize an object into a string representation suitable for cookies? already found .param, but what would be the opposite? or is there any better way? i have an array containing menu states and would like to store it into cookies
[09:03:41] <aaronmcadam> deparam

[09:04:36] <aaronmcadam> can't go too far wrong with ben_alman the plugin king haha :D
[09:04:37] <wpsmith> if I wanted to freelance a jquery project where would be the best place to do that?
[09:04:51] <Unode|Work> Vinny, as far as I know, load() simply waits for the object to be ready. If it's an image, it includes waiting for the image to be loaded on the DOM
[09:04:54] <aaronmcadam> what does that mean
[09:05:01] <aaronmcadam> wpsmith?
[09:05:04] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam. not sessions per se, people tend to review code on pull reqs when they are made
[09:05:18] <Unode|Work> Vinny, but there are some gotchas mentioned on the documentation
[09:05:19] <aaronmcadam> cool
[09:05:24] <vifo> aaronmcadam thanks very much
[09:05:30] <aaronmcadam> np vifo
[09:07:25] <BMCouto> Hi, why does outerWidth() gives me an incorrect value of an element with opacity:0 ?
[09:09:16] <aaronmcadam> k i'm out, cheers guys
[09:10:48] <Unode|Work> BMCouto, I suspect it's because opacity:0 == display:none
[09:11:01] <preinheimer> Hi, I've got a JQuery UI Dialog box that presents fine in FF, Chrome, but there's no X to close it in IE 8. I've googled around but it doesn't look like this is an outstanding bug. JQuery 1.6.2, JQuery UI 1.8.14
[09:11:12] <Unode|Work> which depending on how it's triggered may reduce the size of the element to 0
[09:11:39] <BMCouto> Unode|Work:  yeah but its weird, and element with width:610, returns me 476pxâ€¦ if it was that i should get like width:0 right?
[09:11:42] <Unode|Work> preinheimer, have you tried IE9 ?
[09:12:02] <preinheimer> sec, let me snapshot this VM so I don't lose 8
[09:12:07] <BMCouto> Unode|Work:  so how can i prevent that?
[09:12:30] <Unode|Work> BMCouto, try using the dev tools to read the value. If the tool reads differently then yes
[09:12:31] <djQuery> preinheimer: thats kinda odd. all I can think of is that ie is unable to download the image for some reason.
[09:12:55] <Unode|Work> BMCouto, yes = I've no idea how to help you
[09:12:59] <BMCouto> Unode|Work:  dev tool?
[09:13:04] <BMCouto> Unode|Work:  firebug?
[09:13:08] <Unode|Work> BMCouto, yes
[09:13:12] <ben_alman> :P
[09:13:25] <BMCouto> hi ben_alman
[09:13:28] <Snugug> I'm trying to find the path to the js file I"m working in from within JS. How can I do that?
[09:13:28] <preinheimer> djQuery: I edited the ui.js file, and changed <a href="#"></a> to <a href="#">XXX</a> and those Xs didn't appear either.
[09:13:31] <Unode|Work> except it's not called firebug in other browsers :)
[09:13:32] <ben_alman> hiya
[09:13:48] <BMCouto> yeah it return the right width
[09:14:01] <BMCouto> shit thing is i need to animate from opacity 0 to 1
[09:14:10] <BMCouto> or something that does the same effect
[09:14:23] <BMCouto> but like that outerWidth() comes with incorrect values
[09:14:37] <Unode|Work> BMCouto, then I'm guessing you have some sort of racing condition and the value you are reading is in the middle of the animation
[09:14:47] <Unode|Work> but it's hard to say
[09:15:06] <Unode|Work> BMCouto, also notice the difference between outerWidth() and outerWidth(true)
[09:15:12] <Cork[home]> BMCouto: why not just using animate()?
[09:16:03] <preinheimer> what is the firebug like took for Internet Explorer (8), the developer tools built in are killing me
[09:16:11] <BMCouto> Cork:  I'm using animate
[09:16:22] <BMCouto> to animte from opacity 0 to 1
[09:16:35] <Unode|Work> preinheimer, the built in tools is all I know, but I do most dev work on IE9 which is a lot better in that regard
[09:16:37] <BMCouto> the problem is, at the same time im trying to get an elements width
[09:16:44] <Cork[home]> BMCouto: uh.. must have missed somethign then, why do you need outerWidth?
[09:16:51] <BMCouto> and that width is returned incorrectly until opacity is 1
[09:16:55] <Unode|Work> BMCouto, why do you need the element width?
[09:17:22] <Unode|Work> you aren't trying to scale the element right?
[09:17:23] <BMCouto> cause depende on that width, i have to set a width to its container
[09:18:21] <Unode|Work> I think you can achieve that by animating the two at the same time
[09:18:23] <BMCouto> like i have a container with several elements inside, when that container is animating to opacity 1, i'm getting the width of all childrens to manually force a width to its container
[09:18:32] <preinheimer> Unode|Work: thanks, I'm trying to get IE 9 so I can test there
[09:18:43] <Unode|Work> BMCouto, yeah, that calls for trouble
[09:18:44] <BMCouto> the problem is that the with comes incorrectly until opacity is set to 1
[09:18:54] <BMCouto> i have no other way to do it
[09:19:01] <Unode|Work> BMCouto, you also need to animate the container
[09:19:05] <BMCouto> at least that i can remind
[09:19:13] <BMCouto> Unode|Work:  thats no the problem
[09:19:24] <BMCouto> but to animate the container i need to know the total width first
[09:19:32] <BMCouto> and i cant get because of that
[09:19:37] <Unode|Work> BMCouto, I mean at the same time as the inner element is being animated
[09:19:49] <BMCouto> thats not the problem
[09:19:57] <Unode|Work> then I'm not following
[09:20:02] <BMCouto> to animate at the same time i need to know the total width
[09:20:08] <Unode|Work> no you don't
[09:20:13] <BMCouto> and i dont have the correct total width
[09:20:16] <BMCouto> i do...
[09:20:31] <Unode|Work> animate means, rescale to whatever size you read on that precise moment
[09:20:38] <BMCouto> <container><elem1><elem2></container>
[09:20:39] <BMCouto> i have this
[09:20:50] <Unode|Work> and this will repeat until elem is "ready"
[09:20:56] <Unode|Work> or the animation is complete
[09:20:57] <BMCouto> so im trying to grab the width of elem1 and elem2 to set a width to the container
[09:20:59] <BMCouto> got it?
[09:21:17] <Cork[home]> BMCouto: whats your display type?
[09:21:18] <BMCouto> but i need to do that before the anim is complete
[09:21:24] <Cork[home]> block? inline?
[09:21:28] <BMCouto> Cork, block why?
[09:21:39] <Cork[home]> BMCouto: trying to reproduce but failing
[09:22:08] <BMCouto> Cork:  i'll try to reproduce this
[09:22:11] <BMCouto> on a jsfiddle
[09:22:15] <Cork[home]> http://jsfiddle.net/UwgXn/1/
[09:22:27] <Unode|Work> BMCouto, the simplest solution I can think of it making the outerWidth only launch when the animation() of the inner elements is ready
[09:24:02] <Unode|Work> but I expect that to create some visual nonsense, which is why I was suggesting animating the container at the same time
[09:31:58] <djQuery> BMCouto: can you set the left to a -9999999999999999999 set the opacity to 1 then check the width?
[09:35:07] <aarjona> so, if I load() an url that has external javascripts referenced by <script> tags the correct way to execute them would be to use getScript()?
[09:35:20] <BMCouto> djQuery:  i cant, because its the way page shows up
[09:35:31] <BMCouto> margin:-200px opacity:0
[09:35:36] <BMCouto> and goes to margin:0 opacity:!
[09:35:40] <BMCouto> 1
[09:35:58] <BMCouto> im trying to reproduce this on jsfiddle but works fine thereâ€¦ :S
[09:36:11] <BMCouto> gonna reproduce more exactly lol
[09:39:08] <BillCriswell> Just got to a website with 5 doctypes...
[09:39:43] <ajpiano> that's what html5 is all about
[09:39:52] <ajpiano> you include one doctype for each version of html
[09:39:54] <ajpiano> that your website supports
[09:40:02] <ajpiano> #duh
[09:40:09] <Hoe``> is there a way to select an element who's id has peroids?
[09:40:19] <Hoe``> <div id="foo.bar"></div>
[09:40:21] <ajpiano> ?escaping @ Hoe``
[09:40:21] <bot-t> Hoe``, If you wish to use any of the meta-characters (#;&,.+*~':"!^$[]()=>|/ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\. http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ Also this is probably a bad idea, but... http://j.mp/autoescapeselector
[09:40:34] <BillCriswell> ajpiano: Haha.
[09:40:36] <Hoe``> thanks
[09:40:46] <Hoe``> so $("#foo\\.bar") ?
[09:40:55] <ajpiano> do believe so
[09:41:08] <lexMao> Hi there, is there any way to increase/decrease a counter according to the dragging movement on a page element? (I need to load sequential images to create a 3d view)
[09:41:11] <Hoe``> not my code, just to clearify ;]
[09:41:29] <Hoe``> oh, funny, they had the same exact sample on that page lol
[09:41:52] <ajpiano> lexMao, basically you would bind a handler to "mousemove" on a "mousedown" and unbind it on "mouseup"
[09:42:12] <ajpiano> and increment the counter as part of the mousemove handler, keeping track of the mouse position offset
[09:42:22] <ajpiano> from the original mousedown to where you are now
[09:43:43] <BillCriswell> <li  style="width:;"> niiiiiiiiice.
[09:43:44] <lexMao> ajpiano, I'll give it a try. Thank you
[09:46:34] <gurumelo> Hello, how can i print a variable in jquery for use in php
[09:46:48] <gurumelo> for example, i hace this in javascript/jquery: position.coords.latitude
[09:47:14] <Shwaiil> Q: I've read that .live() shouldnt be used, there's a better one to use instead. Can someone tell me wish and why should I change it ? All my scripts rely on .live(), heavy use here. Any tip ? Thanks! I'm using the followign syntax: $(el).live({ event : function() {}; });
[09:47:17] <Shwaiil> Thanks for looking.
[09:47:25] <chipnt> gurumelo probably submit it to a php
[09:47:43] <gurumelo> and i want to storage this variable with: $sql = "INSERT INTO tabla VALUES(position.coords.latitude)";
[09:48:00] <larzen-wrk> Question - how do I create an element dynamically (like a UL?)
[09:48:08] <gurumelo> what do you refer chipnt ? thanks
[09:48:09] <larzen-wrk> is there a jquery call to do that?
[09:48:23] <Cork[home]> larzen-wrk: $('<ul/>')
[09:48:35] <larzen-wrk> oh nice!
[09:48:49] <Cork[home]> larzen-wrk: then you just attach it where you want it
[09:49:17] <larzen-wrk> Cork[home]: perfect!
[09:49:34] <larzen-wrk> Cork[home]: .. i can juse just .append() ?
[09:49:45] <chipnt> gurumelo http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[09:49:47] <larzen-wrk> or what call do I use to make it a child?
[09:49:56] <Cork[home]> larzen-wrk: append, or .html, or prepend or so on
[09:50:01] <misterm> gurumelo: and you want to open up your site to SQL injection attacks?
[09:50:20] <chipnt> misterm, in php side it can be fixed to be numeric
[09:50:26] <chipnt> else we wont ever post again ?
[09:50:39] <Hoe``> everyone knows the client is a trusted source for SQL ;]
[09:50:57] <chipnt> btw gurumelo before inserting you do need to check against injections :p
[09:51:39] <gurumelo> thank you very much chipnt
[09:52:03] <chipnt> gurumelo btw i recommend you employ one develloper wich knows the difference between php and javascript
[09:52:33] <chipnt> you cant insert in sql a javascript variable
[09:53:39] <gurumelo> ok
[09:56:37] <crazydip> after a successful xhr.abort() the browser still waits for the response.... and then goes to the next page... how can I make the browser just go to the next page?
[09:57:13] <Cork[home]> crazydip: no thats not correct
[09:57:36] <Cork[home]> crazydip: did you check that the connection was actually aborted?
[09:58:16] <crazydip> Cork[home], well, the xhr  triggers an error() but it still waits
[09:58:48] <crazydip> Cork[home], what do you mean? what's happening, is if i hit back button on browser, it just keeps waiting
[09:59:57] <jordotech> Hi guys, I've taken a widget and moved it into a div after $(document).ready() and the JS stops working all together in that div... any ideas?  Can someone take a quick peek?
[10:00:23] <Cork[home]> crazydip: what does back button has to do with xhr.abort() ?
[10:00:36] <jordotech> no errors in firebug console which is the confusing part
[10:02:05] <crazydip> Cork[home], nothing, but both back button and abort() trigger $.post(...).error() event, yet it still waits for the response
[10:02:46] <bung> is anyone aware of any performance difference between $('table').delegate('td','mouseover mouseleave',function(){...}) and $('table td').hover(function(){...}) ? (Im aware of their functional difference, just trying to get a sense of performance)
[10:03:18] <ajpiano> the probably probably performs better because you are binding way fewer events
[10:03:19] <crazydip> Cork[home], I'm pretty new to jQuery.... not sure how everything works
[10:03:23] <ajpiano> the former probably*
[10:03:30] <bung> the delegate you mean?
[10:03:39] <bung> how many events are involved in hover() ?
[10:03:45] <Cork[home]> crazydip: in what browser?
[10:04:01] <Cork[home]> crazydip: i use .about alot and haven't ever seen that
[10:04:10] <crazydip> firefox 5.0
[10:04:12] <ajpiano> bung: you will bind as many events (* 2, 1 for mouseenter and 1 for mouseleave) as there are table cells
[10:04:17] <ajpiano> as opposed to binding one event, on the table itself
[10:04:36] <bung> oh i see
[10:04:39] <bung> i see what you mean
[10:04:41] <Cork[home]> crazydip: and if you inspect the connection with firebug its actually closed?
[10:04:54] <stribor> can anyone help me with problem i am having with submit and click event
[10:05:02] <stribor> http://pastebin.com/8WvjsMSU
[10:05:08] <crazydip> Cork[home], have not done an inspection... will try (never done it before)
[10:05:42] <stribor> it seems that first time i click submit the value doesnt get picked up...so i need to click submit second time in order to have proper validation on submit
[10:07:51] <Shwaiil> Q: For .delegate() can we map to bind multiple events handlers like we do when using .live() ? if now, why not ?  thanks for looking!
[10:08:19] <Cork[home]> Shwaiil: yes
[10:08:28] <Cork[home]> delegate and live is more or less the same thing
[10:08:44] <Cork[home]> except that live map to document and delegate to the element you say it should map to
[10:09:48] <Shwaiil> Cork[home], tks for looking. so if delegate is better I can just change .live( to .delegate( and will work ?
[10:10:15] <Cork[home]> Shwaiil: the syntax for what element it should affect is a bit difference, but thats all
[10:10:30] <Cork[home]> everything about the events is the same
[10:10:45] <Cork[home]> *different
[10:11:44] <Shwaiil> Cork[home], ok. I was wondering if I could use the map sintax, such like $(el).live({ event: function() {}; });
[10:11:46] <Cork[home]> Shwaiil: $(selector).live('', function() {}); is the same as $(document).delegate(selector, '', function() {});
[10:12:15] <Shwaiil> Cork[home], ok I see.
[10:12:24] <Shwaiil> tks
[10:12:44] <Cork[home]> Shwaiil: ya the object map works with delegate too
[10:12:44] <jordotech> Whats up guys, I'm losing js functionality after moving a widget with .html(), is there a better way to do that?
[10:13:12] <Cork[home]> jordotech: you prob want to use .append
[10:13:13] <rns> anyone know why my textbox isn't getting disabled when I select '% GPI' from the dropdown?  Seems like it should be pretty simple.  http://jsfiddle.net/cLSzM/
[10:13:25] <Cork[home]> jordotech: or after
[10:13:57] <jordotech> Cork, oh yea?  will it accomplish the same thing?  I'm basically transplanting some markup from one div to another
[10:14:17] <jordotech> Cork[home], ^
[10:15:19] <Cork[home]> jordotech: no, but html will parse the content html
[10:15:28] <Cork[home]> so all listner is lost
[10:15:47] <crazydip> Cork[home], the script i post is made to sleep for 15 seconds... using .abort() firebug says POST Aborted right when page is loaded, but when I hit back button, the browser sits there for ~15seconds... When I don't use .abort() but just hit the back button it shows POST aborted on button press but again waits until 15 seconds are up
[10:16:22] <Cork[home]> hmm
[10:16:27] <crazydip> Cork[home], if checking for connection aborted is something else, then i dont know how to do that :)
[10:16:49] <Cork[home]> crazydip: nope that is exactly what i meant
[10:17:18] <sphinxxx> on a hover event of an <li> tag, is there any way to know which li tag it is ?
[10:17:24] <Shwaiil> Q: Im going to use .post(), preventDefault for .submit(). I'm wondering if there's a way to serialize all data <input> instead of taking each data element manually, one by one ? Thanks thanks
[10:17:34] <sphinxxx> for example in a <ul> that has 10 <li> tags, how can i know which one i'm hovering?
[10:17:48] <Cork[home]> ?.serialize @ Shwaiil

[10:19:07] <Cork[home]> yes
[10:20:29] <Shwaiil> Cork[home], works fine! thanks for the serialize tip ;)
[10:20:35] <Cork[home]> np
[10:22:01] <sphinxxx> i can't create a var inside a hover event?
[10:22:09] <sphinxxx> "unexpected token var"

[10:26:40] <rod_> Hello! if I'm using .ajax() with the url being a local JSON file with contents {"name":"John"} , when the data is returned from the ajax callback, how do I access it?   I guess it's already a JSON object right? (contentType on the .ajax() was application/json)
[10:26:56] <imsky> don't use .ajax with local files
[10:27:12] <Poohba> hey all.
[10:27:34] <imsky> hi Poohba
[10:27:59] <Poohba> I have this script graph.js and it says to use it I have to call it vi $('table').visualize();  do I put that in the graph.js or do I put that in my php/html?
[10:28:17] <rod_> imsky, for now I'm using a local file as a test before I replace the url with a local webservice
[10:28:42] <rod_> is that my problem?
[10:28:46] <imsky> yes
[10:29:07] <rod_> okay I'll just hook it up to the actual webservice and see if it works.
[10:29:13] <rod_> thanks imsky
[10:29:20] <Cork[home]> crazydip: i tested with this http://pastebin.com/DBYqpKmY
[10:29:47] <Cork[home]> crazydip: and i got a close to instant jump
[10:31:26] <crazydip> Cork[home], i figured it out: the php script that  jquery posted to just froze the browser via sleep... looks like php's sleep() just disables the browser... i take it that if php is doing something, it also disables the browser until its done or is interrupted (js has no chance here)
[10:32:02] <Cork[home]> crazydip: nope
[10:32:09] <CKIDOW> hi
[10:32:23] <Cork[home]> crazydip: my r.php => <?php sleep(15); ?>
[10:32:34] <crazydip> Cork[home], :(
[10:32:35] <CKIDOW> how is it possible to select an element on level up without knowing any attribute?
[10:32:55] <Cork[home]> crazydip: might be worth testing so its not something with/in your browser
[10:33:02] <Cork[home]> crazydip: like a new firefox profile
[10:33:24] <crazydip> Cork[home], i have a vm with 8 browsers i can try in :)
[10:33:27] <Cork[home]> CKIDOW: on level up?
[10:33:35] <Cork[home]> crazydip :D
[10:33:40] <Cork[home]> same as me then XD
[10:33:45] <Cork[home]> (well at work that is)
[10:33:46] <z1000> any suggestiongs for ajax loader gfx that are transparent and actually look good on a gradient bg?
[10:34:07] <CKIDOW> in the html strucutre
[10:34:11] <muzone> I have these radio-labels-turned-into-buttons here - http://jsfiddle.net/uL3hf/ - but how come when I place the inputs outside / next to the labels, they stop working?
[10:35:01] <CKIDOW> <div><p><span></span></p></div> -> $("span").onelevelup().html();
[10:35:04] <z1000> anyone?
[10:35:29] <CKIDOW> because html gives me the inner html of the current selector
[10:36:05] <CKIDOW> or is there method to get the html structure including current selector?
[10:37:04] <muzone> let me rephrase
[10:37:06] <muzone> I'm trying to turn my radio labels into buttons like under "CHOOSE A SIZE" at http://www.theoutnet.com/product/217611 - but at http://jsfiddle.net/uL3hf/ - how come <label for="size_petite"><input id="size_petite" name="size" type="radio">P</label> work, but not <input id="size_petite" name="size" type="radio"><label for="size_petite">P</label>?
[10:38:53] <Cork[home]> muzone: how come what?
[10:40:41] <Cork[home]> oh theres more text in there ;P
[10:41:01] <rod_> yep that fixed my problem entirely imsky.
[10:41:10] <imsky> good to hear, rod_
[10:41:49] <muzone> Cork[home]: selection only works when the input is _inside_ the label
[10:41:59] <muzone> Cork[home]: not when the input is placed next to it
[10:42:34] <rns> anyone know why my textbox isn't getting disabled when I select '% GPI' from the dropdown?  Seems like it should be pretty simple.  http://jsfiddle.net/cLSzM/
[10:42:35] <ries> Gents, for the auto complete plugin can I simply return a comma separated list of items rather then a XML?
[10:43:05] <Cork[home]> muzone: AH
[10:43:15] <Cork[home]> muzone: closest looks for parents
[10:43:24] <Cork[home]> muzone: you want prev()
[10:43:27] <Cork[home]> or prevAll
[10:43:42] <Cork[home]> (given you want to add the input before the label)
[10:44:14] <muzone> Cork[home]: $(this).prevAll('label').addClass('selected'); like that?
[10:44:24] <muzone> yeah sure, input before the label will do.
[10:44:32] <Cork[home]> muzone: no sorry, its the other way around

[10:46:03] <crazydip> Cork[home], it's a firefox and chrome issue: IE 7, IE 8, Opera 11.5, Safari 5 on Windows XP worked fine. Firefox 5.0 on my Ubuntu and FF 3.6 on XP waited 15 seconds and Chrome totally failed to abort() and also waited for 15sec
[10:46:17] <Cork[home]> muzone: would prob throw in a border-radius for good mesure ;)

[10:53:13] <Aaragorn> I am pretty new to this, I wonder if someone could help me figure out why this datepicker calendar in the top right loads the associated calendar bottom left of the screen? http://callserver.dyndns.biz:89/index.php?action=Activities
[10:56:03] <tiben> Aaragorn : identical selector problem ?
[10:56:35] <cipher__> Does anyone by chance have a 'template' for an expanding div element. I need a seemingly floating box for a signup process? :p
[10:57:27] <Aaragorn> ummm i don't understand
[10:57:54] <Aaragorn> the calendar for the datepicker is visible on load at the bottom of the page on left
[10:58:18] <Aaragorn> it's supposed to be hidden unless you click the icon for it
[10:58:41] <tiben> Aaragorn -> have declared this 2 time ? : $("#Date").datepicker
[11:00:07] <tiben> the source code is hard to read in firefox because not formated
[11:00:27] <tiben> so i see only one datepicker when i click on top right
[11:00:43] <Aaragorn> there is only supposed to be one
[11:00:44] <tiben> you work with IE ?
[11:01:03] <Aaragorn> just firefox
[11:01:29] <tiben> where the second datepicker is shown ? i see only one
[11:01:40] <Aaragorn> there is only one
[11:01:51] <Aaragorn> but it doesn't hide on load as it should
[11:02:03] <rns> anyone know why my textbox isn't getting disabled when I select '% GPI' from the dropdown?  Seems like it should be pretty simple.  http://jsfiddle.net/cLSzM/2/
[11:02:13] <Aaragorn> on load it appears bottom left until you click the icon top right the it hides
[11:02:53] <Aaragorn> it functions fine after clicking the icon, it toggles hide and show
[11:03:03] <Aaragorn> trouble is that it is showing on load
[11:03:04] <tiben> ok i understand, i search..
[11:03:13] <Cork[home]> rns: you can't just check with an if statement
[11:03:22] <Cork[home]> rns: you need to bind a change event
[11:03:23] <tiben> maybe you should declare it like that :
[11:03:52] <Aaragorn> like what?
[11:04:03] <tiben> into a $(document).ready(function(){  you're datepicker declaration  });
[11:04:06] <rns> Cork, how do I do that?
[11:04:40] <Aaragorn> let me have a go and see :)
[11:04:46] <tiben> this define the declaration after the DOM load..
[11:04:52] <tiben> ok

[11:05:59] <ale_> Hello, I am planning to make a social network, but I am stucked with the way in which notifications are shown...how can I check up the new notifications without blowing up the database?
[11:06:43] <rns> ravenglass_dan, so how would I bind disable to the event when someone selects a particular option from the dropdown?
[11:07:09] <stribor> can anyone help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/xdxPA/14/....please..just trying to understand why it is not showing alert box
[11:07:35] <Aaragorn> tried it, the issues persists
[11:08:14] <ravenglass_dan> rns: I would check out the 'change' event, but I don't know off the top of my head. Research binding the 'change' event to your dropdown.
[11:08:52] <ravenglass_dan> rns: Your original if check belongs inside the handler function
[11:09:42] <crazydip> Cork[home], your script has a $.get which i tried and it works without having the 15sec delay, but when changing it to $.post it has a delay... can you try $.post?
[11:09:58] <Cork[home]> one min
[11:10:40] <tiben> Aaragorn : maybe this could be the problem :
[11:10:41] <tiben> $('#Date').change();
[11:10:43] <Shwaiil> Q: Assuming that var data = "<html><body><div id='content'><p>Some data!</p></div></body></html>", why does this* return NULL ? *$(data).find('#content').html(). I'm sure it works great, because I've used this before. Any tip ? Thanks for looking!
[11:11:23] <rns> ravenglass_dan, like this?  http://jsfiddle.net/cLSzM/3/
[11:11:40] <tiben> i think this trigger the change event
[11:12:23] <Cork[home]> crazydip: nope still instant redirect
[11:12:31] <ravenglass_dan> rns: yes, like that, but you're missing some closing braces and parentheses

[11:13:58] <Cork[home]> crazydip: how are you triggering the page script btw?
[11:14:04] <nail_> ale_: long polling is usually a good approach, but it really depends on your backend
[11:14:13] <Shwaiil> ajpiano, isnt there a way to solve this natively? without use of plugins ?
[11:14:17] <rhelic> Can anybody comment about jQuery Mobile's excessive Alpha stage?  I swear it's been 7 months and no version change
[11:14:28] <Cork[home]> crazydip: i do in on load, and that means history forward doesn't start it
[11:14:28] <rhelic> would it be so wrong to just use jQuery standard on my mobile app?
[11:14:31] <ajpiano> look at the plugin source and do what it does
[11:14:33] <ajpiano> is how
[11:14:38] <Cork[home]> crazydip: sorry on ready
[11:14:55] <nicknick> Good morning, all. I am tasked with learning JQuery coming from a strictly PHP and MYSQL background. Can anyone point me to a good reference to get me up to speed quickly? I only have the basic understanding of javascritpt.
[11:14:59] <crazydip> mines inline
[11:15:07] <ajpiano> Shwaiil, as you can see it is unsupported behaviour in native jquery
[11:15:08] <crazydip> Corey, mines inline
[11:15:10] <ajpiano> ?jqf @ nicknick
[11:15:10] <bot-t> nicknick, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[11:15:19] <ajpiano> ?101
[11:15:19] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[11:15:27] <nail_> ale_: also, take a look at socket.io
[11:15:39] <nicknick> tahnks ajpiano and bot-t  and @nail
[11:15:52] <nicknick> i will give them all a read over I appreciate all the diverse resource set.
[11:15:58] <ajpiano> lol
[11:16:11] <Shwaiil> ajpiano, I see. Thank you!
[11:16:20] <ajpiano> nicknick, bot-t is a bot, and ale_ was talking to someone else :p
[11:16:35] <ajpiano> socket.io is not a resource for learning javascript
[11:16:40] <nail_> right :)
[11:17:04] <nicknick> lol. sorry I don't really use IRC.  Lol. yes I was thinking that was a bot but you never know....
[11:17:08] <tiben> Aaragorn : can you simply delete this "$date.change" only for testing purpose
[11:17:11] <ale_> nail_: but how would it be with long polling?
[11:17:27] <ale_> nail_: would it blown up the database? it's a mysql
[11:17:51] <Aaragorn> didn't I? where are you looking?
[11:17:55] <nail_> ale_: basically long polling is making an ajax request that the server will hold until it has an actual response to send back
[11:18:23] <rhelic> ale_: if you were thinknig about writing a bot, msg "eggsby" he recently wrote an IRC bot in pure CoffeeScript (JS)
[11:18:42] <ale_> nono, nothing like that, but thanks!
[11:19:00] <ale_> nail_:that's nice..do you have any example of how could it work?
[11:19:17] <ravenglass_dan> rns: http://jsfiddle.net/cLSzM/8/  Why isn't the alert working? This is strange. Perhaps change is not the event we should use?
[11:19:31] <tiben> aaragorn : you have many events for the datepicker, i think the simple change() event in not suitable for a datepicker : http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[11:19:35] <nail_> ale_: again, it's really about the whole stack, e.g if you can get a signal sent to the handler of the current request when there's something to send back, or if you need to constantly loop and query the database...
[11:20:40] <ale_> nail_: I was doing that, contanstly querying the database, but if I have 100 users logged in at the same time, it'll collapse
[11:20:47] <tiben> Aaragorn : sorry i must go on..hope you'll kill this bug....i think u should try another event
[11:21:07] <Aaragorn> like what?
[11:21:25] <Aaragorn> thanks for your help
[11:21:34] <nail_> if you need to loop over and over a good thing would be for example to get your script that inserts the notification in the DB to push the infornmation somewhere else, quickly accessible, eg memcached... the handler would then query that instead of the mysql to know if there's something new to notify the client with
[11:21:39] <rns> ravenglass_dan, not sure...when I put that javascript in my document.ready locally it works
[11:22:07] <ajpiano> ale_: if you want to do long polling, look into see ?cometd

[11:22:44] <nail_> node is pretty good at it too :)
[11:22:54] <ajpiano> haha yeah i would much prefer node at this poitn
[11:23:19] <ravenglass_dan> rns: ooh, maybe we're just confused with jsfiddle! I hardly ever come here. Does the whole thing work on your machine?
[11:23:51] <ale_> nodejs? right, it's pretty good
[11:24:11] <ale_> do you know any good tutorial? cause I read tons of them but still can't do anything :S
[11:24:11] <ravenglass_dan> rns: here ya go. We didn't have jQuery selected on the left side. http://jsfiddle.net/cLSzM/9/
[11:24:20] <ravenglass_dan> rns: That was dumb. hahaha
[11:24:27] <nail_> you can't really do that with apache, you'll run out of threads at some point
[11:24:27] <crazydip> Cork[home], I think there is some weirdness going on in my app... going to call it quits for today... thank you for all your help
[11:24:37] <rns> ravenglass_dan, yes, except now I have a new problem...since this is a formset it is applying disable to the text input box on every form!  Any ideas on how to get around this?
[11:24:44] <Cork[home]> crazydip: np

[11:25:17] <ravenglass_dan> rns: rather than using the class selector, use the id selector, e.g. $('#idOfObject')
[11:25:43] <ravenglass_dan> rns: select the individual object you want to modify, instead of all the items in the class
[11:25:53] <rns> ravenglass_dan, how would I get it to select the id when it is dynamically created?
[11:26:06] <nail_> ale_: but in any case, try to bypass mysql for query loops and use something like memcached, redis or something in this spirit for this
[11:26:24] <ale_> nail_: but the best is to use nodejs?
[11:26:25] <aarjona> if a page I'm loading via an ajax request has scripts it needs to run, what's the correct method? using getScript()?
[11:26:35] <ale_> nail_:what do you mean, how can I get out of threads?
[11:26:44] <ravenglass_dan> rns: that's a problem! Can you just specify that that individual box must have a specific id? How are you generating it?
[11:27:00] <nail_> ale_: if you have 100 clients waiting, that means 100 apache threads holding requests
[11:27:12] <ale_> nail_: with nodejs?
[11:27:17] <nail_> with apache
[11:27:32] <rns> ravenglass_dan, I am generating it serverside via django.
[11:27:46] <nail_> node will keep a connection open and wait for something to happen on it
[11:27:52] <ale_> nail_: but I think every server has apache, so in that case nodejs is for nothing!
[11:28:30] <ravenglass_dan> rns: I'm sorry, I don't know anything about django, though I do love its namesake, Django Reinhardt. I can't help you with that half, but I can tell you that you'll want to be using the id selector.
[11:29:49] <ale_> nail_: I mean, can't I create a chat, with many many rooms??
[11:30:07] <indeh> Where can i download jquery ui widgets as separate files (e.g. jquery.ui.datepicker.js)?  The UI site seems to only give me the option to download them merged into a single file.
[11:30:16] <ajpiano> ale_: you can do that with node a lot easier than apache
[11:30:37] <ajpiano> ale_ not using node because apache is ubiquitous is like, not having a cell phone because there are payphones everywhere
[11:31:09] <ale_> ajpiano: well, but won't it create many threads?? I mean node, and therefore apache will collapse?
[11:31:16] <larzen-wrk> Anyone know how to change the size of the text in the autocomplete box. its huge!!!
[11:31:20] <nail_> if we keep the out-of-threads issue apart, it will work, it's just not suited for this
[11:31:38] <ajpiano> ale_,  node doesn't run on top of apache
[11:31:51] <nail_> ale_: node doesn't fork or use threads as apache does
[11:32:28] <ale_> ajpiano: that's it, I should just use node, but how would I apply it in my case? To show the notifications??
[11:32:41] <ajpiano> i'm not saying you should use node, i barely even know what you're trying to do
[11:33:09] <ajpiano> it sounds like you should probably understand what node is a little bit better, try building a test app using the expressjs framework for node
[11:33:10] <nail_> and if you use node, go for socket.io instead of long polling :)
[11:33:14] <ajpiano> yeah
[11:33:31] <ajpiano> or now.js or whatnot
[11:34:34] <ale_> ok, thanks!
[11:34:37] <nail_> ale_: http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/05/20/video-dahl/ that's a good introduction
[11:35:36] <rns> ravenglass_dan, here is an example of multiple forms.  Is there a way to select the element when its id is dynamically generated?  http://jsfiddle.net/cLSzM/10/
[11:36:12] <ravenglass_dan> rns: is the javascript also dynamically-generated?
[11:37:35] <rns> ravenglass_dan, no, right now the jquery is in the document.ready function
[11:38:28] <stribor> can anyone please help me(maybe explain) why when i click submit first time it shows variable a as empy but second time it shows correct value i typed
[11:38:38] <stribor> http://jsfiddle.net/KVsH7/26/
[11:39:18] <ravenglass_dan> rns: Ok, what you can do is (inside the handler function) extract the integer from the id of the select box and use that to construct the id of the appropriate text field. Does that make sense?
[11:41:07] <Cork[home]> stribor: in what browser?
[11:41:12] <stribor> firefox
[11:42:05] <stribor> Cork[home]: lets say i type "hello" in input box....then i click submit alert box shows empy....second time i click submit then i works correctly
[11:42:25] <Cork[home]> stribor: wfm
[11:42:35] <stribor> Cork[home]: wfm?
[11:42:39] * Cork[home] tries some older versions

[11:43:04] <stribor> what version of firefox you using
[11:43:15] <Cork[home]> ff5-ff8a1
[11:43:19] <stribor> work in IE
[11:43:32] <Cork[home]> works in chromium too
[11:44:01] <stribor> what version of firefox you using
[11:44:12] <Cork[home]> check one min ago
[11:44:42] <stribor> 3.6.17 version of firefox
[11:44:46] <Cork[home]> hmm
[11:44:49] * Cork[home] loads 3.6
[11:45:43] <Cork[home]> damn jsfiddle is slow today...
[11:45:58] <Cork[home]> stribor: still wfm
[11:46:17] <Cork[home]> i'm on .18 though but.. what ever :)
[11:46:27] <stribor> yeah ill try to upgrade
[11:46:31] <stribor> thats Cork:)
[11:46:34] <Cork[home]> np
[11:46:38] <rns> ravenglass_dan, yes that makes some sense.  I will keep trying to experiment with that.  Thanks for the help
[11:47:11] <ravenglass_dan> rns: You're welcome! Good luck!
[11:49:32] <ries> is there a mode for autocomplete that it will receive the complete list once, and will search within the retreived list?
[11:51:10] <PokerAlex2> Hi Guys, need some help with jQuery.ajax()
[11:51:20] <PokerAlex2> any pros around here?
[11:51:23] <chubz24469> okay. right off the bat, when i think of jquery, all i think of are pros (community, plugins, documentation, simple coding[write less do more]) . but i'm wondering, what are the downsides to jquery as opposed to other js framework?
[11:52:15] <EyePulp> chubz24469: You lose out on the ability to be snobbish about using a less well-known framework that you can pretend makes you seem smarter.
[11:52:31] <EyePulp> =)
[11:53:30] <chubz24469> EyePulp: HAHA. yes i believe that is true. but im just wondering. since some people feel that ext js is more professional/business style to it.
[11:55:32] <EyePulp> ext is more of an interface widget solution, isn't it?  I forget if it has a strong set of tools underpinning it.  I know I still write a lot of code w/jquery, but I write a lot less, and it's easy to find other people to maintain it or answer questions when I get stuck.  That's a different sort of value that's harder to define.
[11:55:37] <tomasm-> id like to have content that is divided into tabs where clicking on the tab can scroll the content over to that tab's content (with an animation).... what's the easiest way to accomplish this? I've been looking at Scrollable but am not sure how to get it working with a navigation menu instead of next/prev arrows
[12:05:37] <petafile> Is there a workaround to get the ui/effects/scale plugin to scale contained images as well as text?
[12:08:23] <draginx> http://jsfiddle.net/w4Czb/ how can I make it so "Damage" and "Evasion" will be left out as long as im hovered over the "+" ? (try hovering over "+" then move the mouse down to the next "+" you'll see that it adds span:first for some reason)
[12:16:31] <warreng> so i know window.postMessage lets you pass messages between iframes/etc on different domains... is it possible to pass messages between different tabs in a browser?
[12:17:13] <rns> anyone know how I can get this to disable the text input whenever the option is selected (not just on the change event).  http://dpaste.com/579967/
[12:17:20] <ajpiano> warreng: browser extension apis like for chrome and jetpack for firefox have an api very similar to post message for communicating across tabs
[12:17:21] <ThiefMaster> wow. jquery is nitpicking sometimes
[12:17:38] <ThiefMaster> $('<input/>', {/*attrs*/}) works, $('<input />', {/*attrs*/}) doesn't
[12:18:42] <ajpiano> i don't know if you can do it cross tab without the extension contenxt
[12:19:02] <warreng> ajpiano: ya, extensions make it easy (shared background processes, etc)
[12:19:50] <ajpiano> ThiefMaster, you don't even need the closing / at all
[12:20:19] <draginx> http://jsfiddle.net/w4Czb/Â how can I make it so "Damage" and "Evasion" will be left out as long as im hovered over the "+" ? (try hovering over "+" then move the mouse down to the next "+" you'll see that it adds span:first for some reason) I've even added .stop(true, true) to everything and tried to use hover() =/
[12:20:22] <ThiefMaster> still nitpicky ;)
[12:20:28] <ajpiano> that's a surprising bug if it is only working one and not the other
[12:20:29] <ajpiano> yeah i agree
[12:20:35] <ajpiano> do you have a testcase
[12:21:05] <pjp> hi, is there a way to pop-up file save as dialog box from jQuery/Ajax?
[12:21:31] <rod_> Hello!
[12:21:51] <rod_> What could cause my javascript to only work as intended DURING DEBUGGING, but not during regular loads?
[12:21:58] <rod_> (firebug debugging)
[12:22:35] <tomasm-> rod_, if it calls console.log(), and firebug isnt open, that could cause errors - anything in the error log?
[12:22:39] <tomasm-> error console i mean
[12:23:01] <rod_> oh it is calling console.log
[12:23:15] <rod_> nothing in the error log though
[12:23:41] <ThiefMaster> ah it only breaks if i also have attributes in the tag itself
[12:23:49] <tomasm-> it should check if(console.log) { ... } before it actually calls it
[12:24:16] <ThiefMaster> http://jsfiddle.net/ThiefMaster/u8yXD/
[12:24:17] <rod_> awesome :D
[12:24:26] <rod_> ill try it, i mean
[12:24:27] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: you still there?
[12:24:36] <ajpiano> wassup
[12:24:55] <BillCriswell> <style type="text/javascript"> GOD DAMMIT
[12:24:58] <rod_> eh it did not work
[12:25:08] <ryanneufeld> http://www.metrolyrics.com/where-them-girls-at-lyrics-david-guetta.html
[12:25:17] <necromancer> BillCriswell: *slow clap*
[12:25:33] <ryanneufeld> Big thanks, your help made me look like a rock star :)
[12:26:09] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: http://www.metrolyrics.com/where-them-girls-at-lyrics-david-guetta.html
[12:27:09] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: how do i get it to work!!
[12:27:12] <ajpiano> that is good news though :)
[12:27:12] <BillCriswell> necromancer: 20 minutes trying to figure out why those styles weren't working
[12:27:23] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: you mean it's not?
[12:27:23] <necromancer> that sucks...
[12:27:34] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: try this: http://www.metrolyrics.com/where-them-girls-at-lyrics-david-guetta.html?
[12:27:35] <ajpiano> not for me :/
[12:27:44] <ryanneufeld> make sure it has the ?
[12:27:49] <ryanneufeld> bypass akamai
[12:28:06] <ryanneufeld> so it properly loads the js
[12:28:07] <ryanneufeld> :S
[12:28:33] <jamesdean77> How do you return a string from a function like phps echo ?
[12:28:46] <ajpiano> ah... still not quite working for me yet
[12:28:46] <ryanneufeld> return "this is a string";
[12:28:57] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: that stinks
[12:29:15] <ryanneufeld> I'd ask if you have JS enabled, but that would be silly
[12:29:18] <ajpiano> yeah :/
[12:29:19] <ajpiano> hahah
[12:29:21] <ryanneufeld> any console output?
[12:29:41] <ajpiano> lotta unsafe iframe accesses and a couple 404 on pngs
[12:29:47] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[12:29:52] <ajpiano> but nothing related to your stuff
[12:29:54] <ryanneufeld> ads, and twitter STV
[12:29:57] <ryanneufeld> *STB
[12:29:59] <ryanneufeld> hrm
[12:30:01] <ajpiano> yeah
[12:30:06] <zoned> can i only call .remove(#divID) or should .remove(#imgID) also work?
[12:30:08] <ryanneufeld> logged into fb?
[12:30:25] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[12:30:28] <ajpiano> i am
[12:30:41] <ryanneufeld> mind emailing me a screenshot?
[12:31:23] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: thx
[12:31:34] <ryanneufeld> looks like it's not cleared the cache
[12:31:39] <ryanneufeld> the css is wrong too
[12:32:19] <ryanneufeld> grr, akamai...
[12:34:29] <lunks> I'm trying to use the combobox unofficial plugin, but I need to apply it to elements added to the dom afterwards the page is loaded i.e. via json. How can I do it?
[12:37:03] <rod_> Hello! I think i've figured out my problem...I am writing a bunch of <li> elements, and immediately trying to edit them, it's causing my javascript to only work in Debug mode. Is placing a 'TimeOut' the only solution?
[12:38:31] <StayInSkool> i have a question. i'd like to trigger the drop handler on a draggable object (I basically have a keyboard shortcut which is equivalent to an object onto a dropppable) but now, of course, if i trigger the mouseup event, the drop event handler is called twice, one from me calling it manually and another time from the mouseup if the user already has the draggable hovering over a droppable
[12:38:53] <StayInSkool> perhaps I should ask this in jqueryui hmm
[12:42:01] <Kambfhase> ?p @ rod_
[12:42:02] <bot-t> rod_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:43:32] <rod_> Kambfhase ... I changed my thoughts on why my code is failing. I noticed that my AJAX call is acting ASYNC, even though I have the async: 'false' flag placed. I will paste.
[12:46:14] <Kambfhase> dont you know the elevnth commandment? Thou shall not use synchronous ajax requests.
[12:46:20] <jbrown25> lol
[12:46:42] <rod_> lol well i'm new
[12:46:53] <Aple> Anyone know where to find a solid tut on jQuery.ajax?
[12:47:03] <Aple> Trying to figure out how to do the bare essentials
[12:47:24] <rod_> I'm going to try to rework my code so it works with Async call before I bother trying to fix a broken synchronous call
[12:51:09] <StayInSkool> perhaps i should rephrase. is there any way to not call handlers of a given event?
[12:51:35] <StayInSkool> i.e. temporarily ignore the even basically
[12:51:59] <StayInSkool> event*
[12:52:57] <blaamann> Is it possible to get an element's pixel position within a parent element? Or within the document?
[12:53:17] <StayInSkool> blaamann: position() and offset() should do
[12:54:23] <blaamann> StayInSkool: Thanks (I should've found that in the docs myself).
[12:54:29] <Kambfhase> StayInSkool: so you bind to .drop and to what else?
[12:55:11] <StayInSkool> i bind to drop, but in some cases i trigger the drop handler manually (user hits a button on the keyboard)
[12:55:49] <StayInSkool> but if the user's already hovering a draggable over a droppable, triggering `mouseup` will also trigger the drop handler for the second time
[12:56:08] <K1ng> anyone got barcode reader?
[12:56:43] <StayInSkool> i trigger mouseup to release the draggable
[12:57:31] <StayInSkool> i dont think it's specific to jquery-ui though. my problem is basically temporarily preventing event handlers from being called. or I think that's what the problem is..
[12:57:34] <Kambfhase> use a "mutex". on mousedown: set the mutex to false.
[12:57:48] <Kambfhase> on mouse up: set it to true
[12:58:17] <Kambfhase> und in the .keydown handler only trigger drop if the mutex is true
[12:58:40] <Cork[home]> StayInSkool: yay for font bugs...
[12:58:52] <StayInSkool> Cork[home]:  font bugs?
[12:58:55] <Kambfhase> There might more elegant ways, but this one is easy
[12:59:10] <StayInSkool> Kambfhase: I have something similar in place but your way is easier I think. thanks!
[12:59:13] <Cork[home]> StayInSkool: your message has fonts that make windows font subtitution go wild
[12:59:23] <Cork[home]> StayInSkool: and it write all over the place :s
[12:59:38] <StayInSkool> Cork[home]: that's odd. I don't think I'm using any special fonts
[12:59:59] <Cork[home]> StayInSkool: no but utf8 characters
[13:01:00] <ch3mical> Can anyone recommend me a XML to JSON plugin/lib that correctly converts nested XML nodes and duplicate nodes?
[13:01:11] <Cork[home]> StayInSkool: http://imagebin.org/165183
[13:01:12] <Cork[home]> :)
[13:01:44] <StayInSkool> weird
[13:01:53] <StayInSkool> does fixedsys even support unicode? heh
[13:02:03] <Cork[home]> font substitution
[13:02:10] <Cork[home]> and thats what makes windows messup
[13:02:57] <Cork[home]> there now its off screen
[13:03:09] <StayInSkool> what irc client is that?
[13:03:12] * Cork[home] moves around some windows to clean it up xD
[13:03:16] <Cork[home]> StayInSkool: mirc
[13:04:51] <Kambfhase> ouch, you just broke commandment number 12
[13:05:37] <StayInSkool> yeah. i think that should work nicely Kambfhase, thanks.
[13:05:44] <Kambfhase> :)
[13:05:45] <StayInSkool> having an odd brain fart today. shouldn't have drunk that coffee heh
[13:06:05] <Kambfhase> intant human, just add coffee
[13:06:31] <StayInSkool> it's the other way around here. add coffee -> browse HN and reddit all day due to being unable to write a line
[13:08:11] <Kambfhase> wow, that coffee sounds awesome!
[13:08:36] <StayInSkool> not when you're getting paid to write code!
[13:12:50] <StayInSkool> beautiful. worked great
[13:13:19] <StayInSkool> i just *know* I should've been capable of coming up with it on my own though :P
[13:13:48] <Kambfhase> i can haz coffee now?
[13:14:38] <StayInSkool> you can have the entire pot if you want

[13:15:32] <savid> Hi, I'm using jqueryui tabs in ajax, and I'd like to be able to show an error message if the ajax call results in a 500 error.  Is there a simple way to do this?  I know I can set ajaxOptions, but I need to put the error message in the contents of the currently selected tab, and I'm not sure how to "get" that tab.
[13:16:05] <Kambfhase> throw new Error('Clicked!'); ?
[13:16:22] <Snugug> Ya to make sure the click was working
[13:16:32] <Snugug> It's my debugging
[13:16:42] <Kambfhase> you do know, that prevents the rest from being executed?
[13:16:47] <Snugug> That I did not!
[13:16:50] <Snugug> I'm an idiot
[13:17:06] <Kambfhase> its like saying WWAAAAA; FUUUCKKK *running around sccreiming*
[13:17:13] <Snugug> HAHA

[13:17:25] <Snugug> I was trying to debug w/o alerts everywhere
[13:18:25] <ries> gents, in this snippet : http://pastebin.com/HmcqRxFv any idea why my select is never called? The auto complete works, I get my list of suggestions. But my alert never shows up, even with a debugger I don't see it appearing
[13:18:58] <Snugug> IT ALL WORKS NOW! thank you
[13:19:19] <Kambfhase> np, and read the link! it will get better!

[13:21:14] <tsmart> how do I submit a form I have grabbed from the page and submit it when I have a jQuery popup already in place?
[13:21:26] <tsmart> when you click a button in the popup I grab the form and submit() it
[13:21:28] <tsmart> but nothing happens
[13:21:30] <tsmart> any ideas?
[13:21:59] <Kambfhase> ries: you should get rid of that comma on line 15, the url is crazy but other than that, no idea
[13:22:01] <tsmart> the button is functioning properly b/c I cna debug and get to the function
[13:22:13] <tsmart> but in the function I submit the form and nothing happens
[13:23:51] <ries> Kambfhase: Removing the , didn't help... The URL is correct, it's teh CMS way to generate a URL with a ajax request. THis portion works fine
[13:29:45] <jnylen_> Hi all, I'm having an issue with closing over a loop variable.  Here's my code:  https://gist.github.com/1110296  I forget how to handle this, can someone help?
[13:31:42] <Kambfhase> jnylen_: dont for-in loop over arrays. use $.each()
[13:32:11] <jnylen_> $.each(events, function() { doStuffWith(this); });
[13:32:13] <jnylen_> right?
[13:32:56] <Kambfhase> yeah
[13:34:08] <opie_> anyone using unobstrusive validation, notice that resetForm doesn't reset the error messasges, i'm assuming i need have the unobtrusive library register a method in $.fn.resetForm from what i can tell from https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/blob/master/jquery.validate.js#L383
[13:34:19] <ries> Kambfhase: Weird, this works : $('#imageIdSearch').result(function(event, data, formatted) {alert('Here');return false;});
[13:35:43] <jnylen_> Kambfhase: graagh
[13:35:49] <jnylen_> new problem
[13:37:06] <jnylen_> refresh that gist again (https://gist.github.com/1110296)
[13:37:25] <jnylen_> now the event name gets passed in properly but 'this' (the textbox) does not!
[13:38:29] <Kambfhase> that weird
[13:39:00] <zoned> this code works for iterating over each checkbox that is checked....  $('input:checkbox:checked').each(function(i) {
[13:39:01] <zoned> what about iterating over each checkbox that's NOT checked?
[13:39:02] <Kambfhase> what is `this` then?
[13:39:41] <quakeglen> hi everyone... i have a question...
[13:39:44] <Kambfhase> zoned: $('input:checkbox:not(:checked)')
[13:39:54] <Kambfhase> ?ask @ quakeglen
[13:39:55] <bot-t> quakeglen, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:40:32] <quakeglen> is there any fast way to deselect all items in .selectable on click some element?
[13:41:34] <quakeglen> something like $('#button').selectable('none'); i don't know if something like this exists
[13:43:44] <Kambfhase> quakeglen: selected elements have a ui-selected class. that might help
[13:44:01] <StayInSkool> Kambfhase: do they keep anything in data()?
[13:44:13] <StayInSkool> i thought detecting classes was bad style
[13:44:30] <Kambfhase> who told you that?
[13:44:42] <StayInSkool> i'm not sure hah
[13:45:04] <StayInSkool> but, data is less likely to change than CSS class names I'd think
[13:45:13] <quakeglen> Kambfhase so i just have to remove that class and every item will be unselected... so easy to be true... XD
[13:45:19] <StayInSkool> if they choose to rename it in the future or such
[13:47:39] <Kambfhase> dunno
[13:50:02] <StayInSkool> i've never used selectables but it does seem like all it does when you select something is add the ui-selected CSS class
[13:50:07] <StayInSkool> so yeah, removing it should do
[13:50:47] <StayInSkool> $('.ui-selected').removeClass('ui-selected') ?
[14:00:10] <DannyZB> hey I'm pretty good in helping lol
[14:00:15] <DannyZB> not fair
[14:00:18] <Merrick> With jquery tool tips, im using the slideshow with the fade effect.  i can't get the panes to fade in, only fade out
[14:00:50] <DannyZB> I'm going nuts
[14:00:55] <quakeglen> as there are many items $("#selectable li").each(function(){ $(this).removeClass('ui-selected') });
[14:00:55] <Merrick> this is the setup im using...
[14:00:55] <Merrick> jQuery("ul.tabs").tabs("div.panes > div", {                          current: 'active',                          effect: 'fade',                          fadeInSpeed: 1500,                          fadeOutSpeed: 1500,                          rotate: true}).slideshow();
[14:00:56] <DannyZB> I worked night and day for 4 months
[14:01:20] <DannyZB> and I'm having horrible second-timer stats on my app
[14:02:09] <quakeglen> Merrick try to hide panes after fadein
[14:02:12] <quakeglen> Merrick sorry before
[14:04:54] <Merrick> quake, the issue that im really having is... that the pane will fade out fine and then BOOM appears the next pane.
[14:05:28] <Merrick> i didn't see any sort of range limit on the fadeOutSpeed attribute of the .tabs()
[14:06:26] <sadmicrowave> Merrick, quakeglen, could it be that you need a setTimeout between fadeOut and fadeIn's? I know some versions of IE don't wait for the fadeOut animation to complete before continuing on to the next operation...
[14:07:26] <warreng> anybody know of a way to actually delete a cookie (i.e. remove it from document.cookie) rather than just setting it to a blankÂ value?
[14:08:08] <Merrick> warren set the cookie expiration date to the past.
[14:08:10] <quakeglen> Merrick .delay()
[14:08:21] <Kambfhase> format c:
[14:08:22] <warreng> Merrick: ahh, good call
[14:08:26] <quakeglen> Merrick cold works
[14:08:28] <sadmicrowave> Kambfhase, lmao
[14:08:53] <sadmicrowave> lol
[14:08:54] <Kambfhase> document.format('c:')
[14:09:02] <quakeglen> hahahahaha
[14:09:10] <sadmicrowave> awesome
[14:09:26] <sadmicrowave> +1mill
[14:11:23] <quakeglen> $("jquery").kill("me"); XD
[14:12:00] <ch3mical> o_O
[14:12:24] <sadmicrowave> $('#sadmicrowave').takeOver('world');
[14:12:46] <Merrick> quake, the tools may have a bug.  works fine when setting fadeInSpeed: 1500 and fadeOutSpeed: 500.  But when i change the FOS to 1500, that's when it does the issue i described.
[14:12:49] <bjensen> what does it mean when you have a selector containing a comma? for example $(".users, .projects") ?
[14:13:04] <sadmicrowave> bjensen, means you are selecting both .users AND .projects
[14:13:33] <quakeglen> may be
[14:13:57] <Kambfhase> ?eval ($(1).add(2).add(3) == 6,00001) ? "w00t" : "fail"
[14:13:58] <bot-t> Kambfhase: "w00t"
[14:14:15] <bjensen> sadmicrowave: thanks
[14:14:22] <quakeglen> bjensen can't... commas are for split selectors
[14:15:09] <sadmicrowave> Kambfhase, wtf...how does 1+2+3 = 6,00001?
[14:15:24] <Kambfhase> when you see it, you'll shit bricks
[14:15:40] <sadmicrowave> I'm ready to brick shit
[14:16:06] <Kambfhase> try to find it out for your selfes, and tell me next time we see. or use ?tell
[14:16:06] <bot-t> Kambfhase, Syntax: tell <nick> <message>
[14:16:12] <Kambfhase> i am off!

[14:22:20] <draginx> http://jsfiddle.net/w4Czb/Â how can I make it so "Damage" and "Evasion" will be left out as long as im hovered over the "+" ? (try hovering over "+" then move the mouse down to the next "+" you'll see that it adds span:first for some reason)Â I've even added .stop(true, true) to everything and tried to use hover()
[14:38:33] <imanc> how can I get a count of objects return from a select statementâ€¦ e.g. $('input').count() ?
[14:39:38] <sadmicrowave> imanc, $('input').size()
[14:40:57] <sadmicrowave> draginx, maybe you could tell me what it is supposed to do when you hover on the +
[14:40:58] <vepsen> think .length is preffered
[14:41:23] <draginx> sadmicrowave: its suppose to change the text on the right column where "damage" is
[14:41:24] <draginx> it DOES that
[14:41:31] <draginx> buuuuut when u hover down to the next "+"
[14:41:40] <draginx> it throws in both spans for some reason
[14:42:11] <sadmicrowave> I'm not seeing that happen
[14:42:23] <sadmicrowave> throwing in both spans
[14:42:49] <sadmicrowave> imanc, vesan is right .length will work too and is preffered
[14:42:59] <sadmicrowave> vepsen*
[14:43:14] <imanc> thanks â€¦ size() works
[14:43:43] <imanc> oddly, console.debug($(myselector).size()) was returning nothing, but when I used alert instead of console.debug it shows it was 0
[14:44:33] <sadmicrowave> imanc, try console.log( $(myselector).size() )

[14:45:42] <draginx> hmm
[14:45:44] <sadmicrowave> I have and it works
[14:46:44] <sadmicrowave> draginx, out of curiosity, why are you doing .bind('mouseenter' and 'mouseleave') instead of using .hover()?
[14:47:01] <draginx> sadmicrowave: because hover did not work

[15:07:17] <bjensen> is this valid jquery? css("filter", "alpha(opacity=10)"); It gets shaded but to the same shade regardless of what I set the value to
[15:13:18] <bhosie> in this script, i'm building a list of <li> elements which will be displayed in my #pages div. I'm trying to make each individual li item clickable to swap data to the #data div. My click event is defined at line 59 which corresponds with an <li> id but clicking the element does not load item. Not sure what i'm doing wrong here..
[15:13:32] <bhosie> http://pastebin.com/D4sE8yrW
[15:14:47] <bhosie> oh, i've also tried ('#pages'), ('#pages li') and ('#pages ul li')
[15:16:42] <Es0teric> how do i use window.location to check for a certain phrase in the url?
[15:18:23] <bfred> I have 10 free minutes, ask me anything
[15:18:41] <Es0teric> how do i use window.location to check for a specific $_GET[]
[15:18:41] <Es0teric> ?
[15:21:31] <Es0teric> bfred, how do i check for a certain phrase in a url?
[15:22:17] <bfred> document.location.href.indexOf(phrase)
[15:22:27] <bfred> -1 if phrase is not in there
[15:22:39] <bfred> 0 or more is the position of the phrase in the url
[15:23:03] <Es0teric> ok, so what if its a $_GET[] that i am trying to test?
[15:23:28] <bfred> Es0teric: strill in JS, right?
[15:23:31] <bfred> *still
[15:23:43] <Es0teric> bfred, no.. the $_GET[] is in php.. but it ends up in the url
[15:24:00] <bfred> I use document.location.search.indexOf('name=value')
[15:24:08] <bfred> although it's not safe
[15:24:18] <bfred> it will also match "surname=values"
[15:24:29] <Es0teric> bfred, so then what if i just want to check for /?firstletter= ?
[15:24:42] <Es0teric> in the URL
[15:25:41] <bfred> Es0teric: http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/09/get-url-parameters-values-with-jquery.html
[15:26:04] <bfred> jQuery is not necessary for the first example
[15:26:07] <Es0teric> bfred, i want to check for that in the url.. and if its there to show content.. and if its not, to hide it
[15:28:17] <sgrover> Does anyone have a good notification type tool?  We were looking at http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/a-jquery-ui-growl-ubuntu-notification-widget/ but were unable to make it work (so far).
[15:28:17] <bfred> document.location.search.indexOf('firstletter=value') should do it too
[15:28:37] <sgrover> That one also looks dated (a year or so), and for jQ 1.4...
[15:29:35] <Es0teric> bfred, so then 	
[15:29:35] <Es0teric> document.location.search.indexOf('firstletter=') should work too right?
[15:30:57] <bfred> Es0teric: are you trying to GET what's after firstletter= ?
[15:31:13] <Es0teric> bfred, no... i am just trying to get firstletter=
[15:31:30] <bfred> Es0teric: ok, then
[15:31:40] <bfred> it works too
[15:31:47] <Es0teric> alright cool, thanks
[15:31:49] <Es0teric> i will try it out
[15:32:34] <blaamann> UI Draggable does not allow me to use the scrollbars inside a child element, any tip how I can enable it? If I use the scrollbars it will just drag the two elements http://dpaste.org/IejZ/
[15:37:57] <Es0teric> bfred, its not working
[15:38:53] <bfred> document.location.search.indexOf('firstletter=') should return a number, what is it?
[15:39:10] <Es0teric> how do i check for that number?
[15:40:10] <bfred> alert(document.location.search.indexOf('firstletter='))
[15:41:16] <Es0teric> bfred, it returned -1
[15:41:54] <bfred> Es0teric: then it's not in there
[15:42:29] <bfred> try alert(document.location.search)
[15:42:44] <Es0teric> bfred, now it returned 1
[15:42:50] <Es0teric> when i clicked on a link
[15:43:43] <mconstantine> Can anyone recommend a good custom scrollbar library? I've tried mCustomScrollbar.js but was underwhelmed.

[15:44:55] <SuperID> I'm designing my first jquery interface for a system that is to be a document management console.   People will have to open and edit documents, and route them through various steps (office to office).   I'm looking for any UI tips for this kind of usage
[15:50:07] <zoned> i have a div "stepMenu" which has a nested div with class "stepMenuCode", why does the following code not work for removing that the div with that class? $('#stepMenu' + i).remove('.stepMenuCode');
[15:50:31] <zoned> ignore the + i
[15:52:55] <Segaja> hi, is it possible to center the tabs of a jQuery UI tabs element?
[15:53:50] <leo-rj-br> ~pastebin
[15:53:54] <jedimind> can anyone think of a way to use browsers' default scrolling, but have it snap to items
[15:54:00] <leo-rj-br> ~bin
[15:54:12] <jedimind> for example, i have a div with overflow scroll on it, but want it to snap to LIs in the display area, not get caught between items
[15:54:34] <jedimind> wow i cant articulate anything today
[15:54:43] <jedimind> IT MAKES SENSE IN MY HEAD
[15:56:28] <peol> jedimind: you could probably use the scroll event and delay an re-position when you assume the user has stopped scrolling, if not, i think your best bet is to use simulated scrolling
[15:56:55] <peol> assuming is never a great idea in web dev though
[15:58:10] <jedimind> id like to stay away from simulated scrolling, adds unecessary bloat (mousewheel scroll, images, blah blah)
[15:58:17] <zoned> i have a div "stepMenu" which has a nested div with class "stepMenuCode", why does the following code not work for removing that div with the class?:  $('#stepMenu' + i).remove('.stepMenuCode');
[15:58:36] <jedimind> but i guess that makes sense, use scroll event, calculate where it's scrolled to, if it doesnt match [height of items] * something; then position
[15:59:15] <peol> jedimind: listen to the scroll event and check if the mouse button has been released, if it has, reposition your li with scrollTop()
[15:59:22] <jedimind> yeah
[15:59:32] <jedimind> i dont want to move the LI, i'll just move the scroll position
[15:59:47] <peol> that would also work with mousewheel afaik
[15:59:53] <jedimind> to a "round number"
[16:00:08] <peol> jedimind, yeah, see ?scrollTop
[16:00:08] <bot-t> jedimind, .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/

[16:00:13] <benji__> Hi, does anyone know a simple javascript popup lib that allows to open on popup on top of another one ?
[16:00:16] <peol> use that to set the position of that div
[16:00:51] <zoned> is there a way to remove a div without knowing it's id? i only know it's class attribute
[16:01:20] <benji__> zoned: $("div.myclass").remove() ?
[16:01:58] <zoned> benji__: there are other divs with that class, i only want to remove one that is nested inside of a div that i DO know the id of, make sense?
[16:02:08] <peol> benji__: doesn't the jQuery UI component do that automatically (increase z-index)?
[16:02:22] <jedimind> how do you listen to a scroll event on an arbitrary container (vs document)
[16:02:26] <benji__> zoned: $("div#myid div.myclass").remove() ?
[16:02:40] <jedimind> .scroll
[16:02:41] <jedimind> duh
[16:02:42] <peol> no need to prefix id selectors
[16:03:06] <benji__> indeed
[16:03:53] <Segaja> hi, is it possible to center the tabs of a jQuery UI tabs element?
[16:03:55] <benji__> peol, thank you for your answer
[16:04:38] <peol> leo-rj-br: Is that the only thing you get from the server?
[16:04:40] <zoned> benji__: worked. thanks. :)
[16:04:41] <Es0teric> how do i create an if statement using -> document.location.search.indexOf('firstletter='); that will show or hide a div based on that being on the url or not?
[16:05:03] <benji__> peol, however, I am not sure that a modal dialog can be displayed on top of another one
[16:05:08] <benji__> let's try it
[16:05:17] <leo-rj-br> peol, there other elements
[16:05:50] <peol> leo-rj-br: try using .filter instead of .find, .find is used to find stuff inside a wrapped element, you just have a collection of elements you want to .filter
[16:06:03] <Es0teric> this is not working -> http://pastie.org/2281858
[16:06:28] <madprops> how can i check if it is not active? if($('.inputcontent').is(':active'))   i mean how do i negate that?
[16:06:58] <peol> Es0teric: Save that as a boolean and use $('#some-div')[ (myBool ? 'add' : 'remove') + 'Class' ]('myClass');
[16:07:16] <peol> madprops: put an ! before $
[16:07:33] <Es0teric> peol, you lost my

[16:07:41] <bhosie> I'm loading a list of items into a div from a click() event. each item is surrounded by <li> tags and is loaded into the div container with html(). how can I access the individual <li> items with event handlers?
[16:07:46] <leo-rj-br> peol, tks works fine
[16:07:52] <z1000> I need a jquery carousel / thumbnail slider that only moves 1 item at a time... any suggestions?? doesnt seem there is something easily / readily available
[16:08:21] <peol> Es0teric: var isActive = document.location.search.indexOf('firstletter='); $('#some-div')[ (isActive ? 'add' : 'remove') + 'Class' ]('myClass');
[16:09:02] <peol> Es0teric: It's equivalent of doing if (isActive) { $('#some-div').addClass('â€¦.'); } else { $('#some-div').removeClass('â€¦.') }
[16:09:06] <z1000> someone please..
[16:09:39] <Es0teric> peol, i only have ids no classes
[16:10:00] <peol> Es0teric: then change the selector to your needs, replace #some-div with .some-class
[16:10:44] <Es0teric> peol, why would i change #some-div to .some-class when #some-div is what i am trying to hide?
[16:11:11] <z1000> no one huh?
[16:11:36] <peol> z1000: There's literally thousands of those
[16:11:40] <z1000> show me 1
[16:12:02] <z1000> cant find any that allow lets say 5 to be shown... and incremenet only 1 at a time
[16:12:17] <peol> Es0teric: Ah, sorryâ€¦ I misunderstood. Try var isActive = document.location.search.indexOf('firstletter='); $('#some-div')[ isActive ? 'show' : 'hide' ]();
[16:12:39] <Es0teric> oh, ok peol lol thanks
[16:13:09] <ChrisBuchholz> Can anyone recommend a great plugin for HTML5 History and fallback for non-supporting browsers?

[16:14:31] <z1000> peol,
[16:14:36] <Es0teric> peol -> http://pastie.org/2281858
[16:14:47] <z1000> thanks for making me feel retarded.. i looked for a bit literally couldnt find 1

[16:15:35] <z1000> thanks peol
[16:15:53] <peol> z1000: No worries, not always easy to find the right keywords
[16:16:56] <abjorn> :o
[16:17:48] <Es0teric> peol, did you get my link?
[16:19:18] <peol> Es0teric: yeah, it looks all right, indexOf is returning -1 if it can't find it though, so just checking if it's true might not suffice (since it could theoretically match position 0), where is this <script>-block located in the document?
[16:19:39] <Es0teric> peol, it is located in the bottom
[16:19:58] <Es0teric> the bottom of the jQuery(document.ready)
[16:20:06] <peol> Es0teric: wait, you're missing and () at the bottom
[16:20:10] <peol> an*
[16:20:23] <Es0teric> its on the header though
[16:20:58] <Es0teric> peol, when its not on firstletter= it does return a -1
[16:21:01] <Es0teric> i did an alert
[16:21:04] <peol> Es0teric: That code will never execute, you're wrapping it in an anonymous function that you never invoke
[16:21:24] <Es0teric> peol, i took it out of the anonymous function and it still doesnt work
[16:22:15] <ChrisBuchholz> peol: bbq doesnt seem to use html5 history statechange, pushstate, replacestate, popstate and so
[16:22:42] <ChrisBuchholz> peol: or am i misunderstanding?
[16:23:08] <peol> ChrisBuchholz: No, you're probably right :p
[16:24:06] <peol> ChrisBuchholz: But I don't think you can use a fallback method without using hashes
[16:24:25] <Es0teric> peol, did you see what i wrote?
[16:25:18] <peol> Es0teric: Yes, I'm not sure what to tell you. If you're sure the code is executing and the DOM element exists when it runs, it should work.
[16:26:14] <peol> Can you console.log( $j('#search_row_container')[0] )?
[16:26:44] <Es0teric> peol -> http://pastie.org/2281858 that worked
[16:27:53] <peol> Es0teric: Yeah, the #search_row_container you had earlier probably doesn't exist when you run the code (or exist at all?)
[16:28:14] <Es0teric> yeah, it didnt exist... it was supposed to be #search_row_wrapper
[16:28:56] <Sean-Der> Hello right now I am a php and mysql developer and I am looking for what language I should pursue to expand website. Right now I have a normalized DB and a basic purchase (select product and insert with customer ID)
[16:29:07] <Es0teric> and ontop of that, i was supposed to check for the 1 or -1, peol
[16:29:15] <Sean-Der> Does jQuery offer the ability to work with MySQL and make purchases interactive?
[16:29:31] <Sean-Der> Like adding and removing fields?
[16:29:45] <peol> Es0teric: 1 only means it's on position 1, if you have more parameters and it's not first, your code will break
[16:29:52] <peol> Es0teric: You should check for !== -1
[16:30:01] <Es0teric> peol, thats the only parameter i really wanted to check...
[16:30:16] <Es0teric> because thats the only code that looks at the url
[16:30:33] <peol> For now, what happens in a year and someone adds a parameter? :p
[16:30:53] <Es0teric> peol, i'll cross that bridge when i get to it unless you want to assist with that
[16:30:54] <Es0teric> lol
[16:31:01] <peol> Sean-Der: Work with MySQL? We're talking browser versus server languages
[16:31:15] <peol> Es0teric: Just check for !== -1 instead of === 1
[16:31:26] <Es0teric> alright, peol
[16:31:28] <DofLeFou_> I have a Label ... <label for="member:foo">My text</label> ..... How would get the this label text in Jquery?
[16:31:57] <peol> DofLeFou_: see ?attr
[16:31:57] <dabear> .attr("for")
[16:31:58] <bot-t> DofLeFou_, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[16:31:58] <Sean-Der> peol: Work with MySQL in the way that Ajax offers
[16:32:16] <Sean-Der> I am confused in what the next book I should pick up is
[16:32:45] <peol> I'm not sure what you're talking about, Sean-Der
[16:32:56] <madprops> is this how i can check if something is focused? if($('.inputcontent').is(':active'))
[16:33:43] <peol> madprops: use :focus
[16:33:52] <Sean-Der> peol: Since HTML is stateless jQuery can give the illusion of interactivity?
[16:34:57] <adnasa> Sean-Der: so to speak
[16:36:10] <DofLeFou_> peol: http://jsfiddle.net/8PCh9/ .. what am I doing wrong
[16:36:35] <Sean-Der> adnasa: Does it offer the same features as Ajax? Sorry that I am confused I am just trying to understand the Differnce of jQuery vs Ajax
[16:36:55] <peol> DofLeFou_: You're not using .attr like we told you :)
[16:37:11] <peol> DofLeFou_:  $('#NewMasterName').attr('for')
[16:37:23] <peol> ehm
[16:37:38] <peol> DofLeFou_: $('label').attr('for')
[16:38:03] <adnasa> Sean-Der: jQuery is a library to build interactive/work-with-dara websites more rapidly while Ajax is a coding technique, completely different thing :-)
[16:38:26] <adnasa> work with data, not dara.
[16:38:52] <Sean-Der> adnasa: So I would have to understand both to be able to achieve my goals?
[16:39:19] <adnasa> to answer your first question you can achieve Ajax even with raw javascript, with out the help with jQuery.
[16:39:39] <adnasa> Sean-Der: I'm sorry... what was your goal? (just entered the chatroom)

[16:42:50] <duttons> hi all
[16:43:38] <duttons> I am wondering if someone may be able to help with a bit of a query around getting a jquery zoomer to work
[16:43:58] <benji__> Hi, how can I download a minified all-in-one version of jquery-ui?
[16:44:08] <duttons> its cloudzoom but need to link it to a image wrapper..
[16:44:23] <coldhead> ?ask @ irregularexp
[16:44:23] <bot-t> irregularexp, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:44:33] <duttons> could someone take a look and see if they can advise best way to link this?
[16:44:49] <coldhead> benji__: try the one on the google CDN
[16:45:32] <duttons> anyones help would be much appreciated.
[16:46:06] <Sean-Der> adnasa: I use PHP and MySQL now I have worked with form in the basic sense using (Join, Select, Update and Delete) mostly. I am looking to add an interactive experince. Generating Total Cost realtime, allowing the user to add more dropdowns their order.
[16:46:25] <coldhead> do you have a link, duttons?
[16:46:44] <benji__> coldhead, cool , thanks :)
[16:46:49] <Sean-Der> adnasa: It seems like a shopping card, but it is used for a different purpose, but following the shopping cart design has helped lead my learning
[16:46:56] <duttons> yep..   http://chicfreakz.co.uk/flowergirls.html
[16:50:08] <duttons_> sorry about that, my chat dropped off
[16:51:10] <adnasa> Sean-Der aha okay then... to achieve your goals: I suggest then that you learn the basic rules and techniques in the use of Ajax.. it should this easier to use the $.ajax() object in jQuery.
[16:51:31] <PokerAlex> Need some help with $.ajax
[16:51:37] <duttons> <coldhead>: sorry, did you get that?
[16:51:39] <PokerAlex> anybody can help me?
[16:52:01] <coldhead> sorry duttons, that page is way too topical for me to look at at work :(
[16:52:09] <coldhead> people will think i'm getting married

[16:52:58] <Sean-Der> adnasa: Thank you for the advice, do you reccomend a particular book or website? Their API should have some guides
[16:53:07] <duttons> anybody else???
[16:54:34] <duttons> <coldhead>: its more to just do with the image wrapper #displayed..  I need to be able to link it to cloud zoom but I would have to talk someone through the current script.. and how it needs changing I think
[16:54:51] <adnasa> Sean-Der: w3schools.com is very explanatory.. googling for it can be overwhelming, but this one got me started http://www.learn-ajax-tutorial.com/
[16:55:24] <Sean-Der> adnasa: Bookmarked! Thank you for your help I am going to start reading
[16:55:41] <duttons> could anyone help with a bit of a question that I have..
[16:55:46] <adnasa> Sean-Der: and goodluck, come back to us when you have more questions.
[16:56:00] <coldhead> adnasa: you can't recommend w3schools in this channel without the w3fools disclaimer
[16:56:15] <duttons> I am trying to implement cloud zoom script but need to get it to work alongside another script..

[17:00:43] <duttons> <nitrospectide>: could you not include a new style and mark it as !Important?
[17:01:18] <nitrospectide> duttons: via regular css, changing styles on elements in an iframe is not possible
[17:02:49] <adnasa> it's more likely to use inlined css in an iFrame... eeeww :-)

[17:03:50] <duttons> I am trying to implement cloud zoom script but need to get it to work alongside another script..
[17:03:57] <duttons> I would really appreciate picking someones brain for a min..
[17:09:17] <duttons> I am wondering if someone may be able to help with a bit of a query around getting a jquery zoomer to work ?
[17:09:24] <duttons> I would really appreciate picking someones brain for a min..
[17:11:52] <adnasa> coldhead: thanks for w3fools... realized I kinda needed that.

[17:13:54] <duttons> I have a thumbscontainer and an image wrapper... I need to add clouzoom to whichever image is in the image wrapper at the time..  much like this http://www.soulmyst.com/ but on the image wrapper and thumbs comtainer in http://www.chicfreakz.co.uk/flowergirls.html    could anyone help make sense of it?

[17:33:36] <RTPMatt> howdy!
[17:34:30] <superlou> Is Datejs the recommended date parser to use with jquery?  I've been seeing some funny behavior with date parsing sometimes returning null
[17:34:31] <superlou> ?
[17:34:33] <Assimilater> can anyone help me figure out why this datepicker isn't properly hiding when it loads at first? You see a sliver of it on the bottom left until you click it the first time: http://callserver.dyndns.biz:89/index.php?action=Successes
[17:40:16] <coldhead> superlou: dates and times are hard in every language and library :(
[17:40:33] <coldhead> the recommended practice in jQuery is to avoid dates and times :)
[17:40:54] <superlou> coldhead, so I've found.  Datejs seems pretty darn good, except for it occassionally returning null for the same data as worked earlier
[17:41:14] <superlou> also, making a scheduling application.  dates/times will be a necessary evil :(
[17:41:15] <coldhead> ugh that's appalling
[17:41:44] <superlou> yeah.  plus datejs looks like it might be abandonware, but i can't find a more recent library with any kind of community
[17:43:44] <ch3mical> Has anyone used cohuman?
[17:43:54] <ch3mical> I need to find something similar to replace it :/
[17:44:27] <Assimilater> anyone? ^^
[17:44:48] <ch3mical> Or does anyone know of a good agile project/task tracker that's free to use? lol :)
[17:45:12] <superlou> ch3mical, i like redmine
[17:45:28] <superlou> but might need to add a plugin or two depending on how agile you are
[17:46:40] <ch3mical> Assimilater: just add .datepicker("hide") to the init chain?
[17:47:00] <ch3mical> superlou: yeah, I need something for agile
[17:47:07] <ch3mical> superlou: we used to use redmine
[17:47:39] <superlou> oh
[17:47:42] <superlou> oh well
[17:47:46] <ch3mical> Thanks though
[17:48:14] <plunkin> pivotaltracker? ... i'm a newb though... so don't listen to me
[17:49:01] <Assimilater> ch3mical: that doesn't appear to have worked...
[17:50:25] <Assimilater> because i recognize the js may be hard to read: http://pastebin.com/MPnaQbqb
[17:50:31] <imanc> is anyone here good with jquery /namespace object binding issues?
[17:51:22] <ch3mical> Assimilater: dunno, sorry
[17:51:30] <Assimilater> thanks for trying
[17:52:05] <imanc> http://pastie.org/2282251 <- inside the .each loop on line 21, I lose the object's context, so I can't use this. and access anything. How can I get it back?
[17:52:38] <Assimilater> i think it's a bug in ui 1.9m5
[17:53:12] <Assimilater> i just stripped out all other js code and it still appears to have issue
[17:53:16] <ch3mical> Submit a bug report :)
[17:53:25] <Assimilater> will do but that hardly helps me here and now
[17:53:40] <Assimilater> i wonder if i can somehow replace the datetime code from the stable release of ui
[17:54:09] <Assimilater> ajpiano: you here with thoughts? :P
[17:54:44] <ch3mical> I've never seen that issue myself
[17:55:06] <Assimilater> well when i strip out all *other* javascript....
[17:55:12] <Assimilater> i don't know what else it could be...
[17:55:16] <ch3mical> You would think if it was a bug, the demo site would behave the same way
[17:55:30] <Assimilater> one would think...
[17:57:11] <abjorn> the queries
[17:57:12] <abjorn> of j
[17:57:26] <stribor> http://pastebin.com/Sck67CWu
[17:58:06] <stribor> would anyone be kind enough to explain why on false i am not able to click on submit button any more(its grays the buton out)
[17:58:19] <stribor> any help or direction would be much appreciated
[17:58:35] <stribor> this is the link http://pastebin.com/Sck67CWu
[17:59:00] <abjorn> Because that's what returning false on a button submit does
[17:59:25] <stribor> i am trying just if its false to allow user to enter corect value
[17:59:43] <stribor> and if its correct allow to submit
[18:00:44] <stribor> abjorn: would you be kind to help me understand how to allow user to click submit button again after he corrected the value
[18:02:42] <KeyLimePi> Is it possible to "bring" PHP code into jquery?  Specifically, this concerns an if/then statement with an array done in PHP
[18:04:14] <coldhead> they're operating on different machines, obviously, but if you can get your PHP to emit JS then that js can operate on the PHP data
[18:04:21] <Samuel_H> KeyLimePi You mind if I pm ya bro ?
[18:04:23] <coldhead> or something very like it
[18:04:36] <stribor> is there anyone that would be able to help me with this....i am not asking to write it for me.....but pointing me in some direction would be much much appreciated
[18:06:12] <coldhead> stribor: i haven't seen that behaviour before but if you can get a working demo on jsfiddle we can take a look
[18:06:20] <coldhead> or jsbin
[18:06:26] <coldhead> as you like
[18:06:34] <stribor> ok give me sec
[18:07:14] <duttons> I have a thumbscontainer and an image wrapper... I need to add cloudzoom class to whichever image is in the image wrapper at the time..  much like this http://www.soulmyst.com/ but on the image wrapper and thumbs comtainer in http://www.chicfreakz.co.uk/flowergirls.html    could anyone help make sense of it?
[18:10:19] <KeyLimePi> Anyone here know if results (generated dynamically from an if/then statement) from a php array can be passed into jquery ?
[18:11:47] <stribor> coldhead: i am trying to get working version http://jsfiddle.net/5HTuv/6/....but cant get it done
[18:12:28] <stribor> all i am trying to do is if user enters value that is less then 100 doesnt submit the form....otherwise submit
[18:14:42] <imanc> could someone take a look at this? http://www.pastie.org/2282327
[18:17:53] <ajpiano> imanc: 'this' can't be both the 'this' of the each loop AND the 'this' of the object :)
[18:18:04] <ajpiano> imanc: inside of the .each loop the scope changes
[18:18:11] <HealingDruid> quick trivial questions. what does fn mean in respects to a function?
[18:18:31] <ajpiano> HealingDruid: it's just convention shorthand
[18:18:32] <HealingDruid> suck ash JQuery.fn
[18:18:37] <imanc> ajpiano: yes, how do I get to the original context?  e..g how do I access this.aggregates.  I have tried making aggregates global and it's still not accessible
[18:19:00] <HealingDruid> ajpiano: short hand for what?
[18:19:09] <ajpiano> for "any function reference"
[18:19:13] <stribor> coldhead: still there
[18:19:24] <HealingDruid> hm..okay let me google that. thanks for your help
[18:19:27] <ajpiano> imanc http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide31
[18:20:02] <ajpiano> imanc: you might want to start back at slide like, 28
[18:20:17] <ajpiano> HealingDruid: there's nothing to google
[18:20:47] <ajpiano> it's just like, shortand for a reference to any arbitrary function which does not have to be written out because it's just an example
[18:20:53] <ajpiano> or documentation, etc.
[18:20:57] <HealingDruid> oh. i see
[18:22:23] <HealingDruid> ajpiano: i usually see it in reference to anonymouse function when i look at source code
[18:22:37] <ajpiano> yeah
[18:22:44] <ajpiano> it's like, if i have some plugin that has some callbacks
[18:23:21] <stribor> is there anyone here that wopuld be wiling to spend few minutes with me to help me understand this code
[18:23:24] <ajpiano> and i want to say hey, pass an anonymous function or a function reference, i would just document the parameter as "fn" likely
[18:23:51] <HealingDruid> ajpiano: i see i see...thanks for your explaination and patience. I have a greater understanding
[18:23:59] <HealingDruid> jquery: and thank you library for existing
[18:24:02] <ajpiano> hoory
[18:24:26] <HealingDruid> JQuery: you're welcome HealingDruid.
[18:24:27] <imanc> ajpiano: can I have both contexts at the same time?
[18:24:36] <ajpiano> imanc: no
[18:24:37] <imanc> as different vars, perhaps?
[18:24:41] <ajpiano> well, yes
[18:24:46] <ajpiano> but there's only one 'this' at a time
[18:24:52] <ajpiano> did you look at the slide i linked you to?
[18:24:58] <imanc> otherwise .each() is  a completely pointless construct
[18:25:01] <ajpiano> imanc before the each loop, do var self = this;
[18:25:04] <imanc> yes, trying to digest it
[18:25:07] <ajpiano> and then self.whatever
[18:25:09] <ajpiano> inside of the loop
[18:25:11] <imanc> interesting
[18:25:26] <ajpiano> the other alternative is to force the scope of the loop to be 'this'a nd use the element argument to each
[18:26:36] <ajpiano> $(".foo").each( $.proxy(function(i, el ) { this.whatever = $(el).attr("something");   }, this));
[18:30:12] <denisbr> Hello All
[18:30:51] <imanc> ajpiano: damn you javascript.
[18:30:58] <imanc> thanks for your help - it works now!
[18:31:07] <ajpiano> :)
[18:31:26] <imanc> But it seemed a key problem was me assigning charity.aggregates = {[the data]};
[18:32:00] <ajpiano> making it global was definitely not something you wanted to do to solve the problem
[18:32:01] <imanc> when I assigned them via my make shift contructor / init function, it all started working again
[18:32:15] <imanc> ajpiano: no, i removed it from global scope again
[18:32:41] <ajpiano> you should remove _message too :p
[18:32:59] <imanc> ajpiano: yeh?  why is that?
[18:33:12] <ajpiano> because the amount of globals you want to be adding is pretty much 0
[18:33:36] <imanc> is that a global though?  I thought it wsa enclosed in var charity and thus self contained?
[18:33:46] <ajpiano> no
[18:33:50] <imanc> hmm
[18:33:55] <imanc> why is js so confusing?
[18:33:57] <ajpiano> there is only function scope in javascript
[18:34:02] <cub_> hey
[18:34:14] <ajpiano> any time you do foo = bar
[18:34:16] <ajpiano> and there's no var
[18:34:21] <ajpiano> it just makes a global variable
[18:34:41] <imanc> oh, I was told using var made it global
[18:34:56] <cub_> does anyone know if they can fix the delays on sliding at http://c0decub.com/Halp/ basically 	$active.removeClass('active last-active'); needs to be set at a delay of 5 secz
[18:34:57] <LocalPCGuy> other way around
[18:35:38] <imanc> so if I put var _message= $(), i'll have avoided doing the js unthinkable of creating a global?
[18:35:53] <cub_> does anyone know if they can fix the delays on sliding at http://c0decub.com/Halp/ basically 	$active.removeClass('active last-active'); needs to be set at a delay of 5 secz
[18:36:05] <ajpiano> imanc: yep
[18:36:09] <ajpiano> or you can just set it outside of the object
[18:36:14] <cub_> .delay(5000); nop?
[18:36:45] <imanc> OKay, I need to get some sleep as it's 2:36 - thank you for your help!
[18:37:07] <cub_> nobody knows LOL
[18:37:29] <cub_> nor do i though
[18:37:43] <cub_> anyway i knew this was fruitless 80% of the members here are AFK or bots lol
[18:38:43] <LocalPCGuy> nope
[18:39:08] <jedimind> is there a variable that contains the width of the scrollbar area ?
[18:39:25] <LocalPCGuy> I think .delay() only works on elements that are queued (basically animations)
[18:39:33] <cub_> it is an animation
[18:39:44] <LocalPCGuy> but the element isn't in the queue yet
[18:39:50] <cub_> or idk it just changes opacity
[18:39:53] <cub_> swaps classes
[18:40:12] <cub_> thats why i linked the page it's hard to tell what it does unless you view it
[18:41:03] <cub_> http://c0decub.com/Halp/
[18:41:09] <cub_> but yeah don't want to be a spamming asshat or whatever
[18:41:12] <cub_> ill just ask on stackoverflow
[18:41:13] <LocalPCGuy> which part are you talking about?  the image?
[18:41:17] <cub_> yes
[18:41:19] <cub_> background-image
[18:41:20] <cub_> at the bottom
[18:41:23] <cub_> the sliding thing
[18:42:35] <LocalPCGuy> yah, it fades a new image in, and then immediately switches back?
[18:43:24] <cub_> yes
[18:43:27] <cub_> thats why i want a delay
[18:43:35] <LocalPCGuy> anytime you change a class, that change will happen immediately
[18:43:38] <cub_> theres probably a way just to append background-image
[18:43:45] <cub_> in a set interval
[18:44:34] <stribor> http://jsfiddle.net/5HTuv/41/   can anyone look at this code and help me learn how to prevent submit event in sace input is not correct
[18:44:51] <coldhead> 41 revisions, you poor man
[18:46:18] <coldhead> stribor: http://jsfiddle.net/5HTuv/43/
[18:46:21] <coldhead> that works for me
[18:46:48] <cub_> Stack overflow time
[18:46:53] <stribor> i am trying man...lol
[18:47:14] <stribor> i just want to prevent submit if input is not right
[18:47:15] <coldhead> LOL
[18:47:19] <stribor> lol
[18:47:25] <cub_> check if input is string
[18:47:29] <cub_> or ! numeric
[18:47:55] <stribor> i got that workin here  http://jsfiddle.net/5HTuv/41/
[18:48:14] <stribor> i got alert box telling me if smaller or bigger
[18:48:20] <coldhead> so what's the problem?
[18:48:34] <jaypitidi> how can I add an active class to this script? when the class is active of course... http://jsfiddle.net/Pear5/
[18:48:51] <stribor> i want to write code that will prevent submit event in case if its less than 200
[18:49:01] <LocalPCGuy> cub_ do you have styles for the active class
[18:49:08] <cub_> in stylesheet
[18:49:17] <cub_> CTRL U
[18:49:44] <stribor> i am trying to learnn...lol
[18:49:56] <stribor> ill make 200 revisions tonight...lol
[18:50:11] <LocalPCGuy> stribor you need a preventDefault if you want to prevent the submit from happening
[18:50:17] <coldhead> stribor: http://jsfiddle.net/5HTuv/45/
[18:50:34] <coldhead> it's just a button, LocalPCGuy, not a submit
[18:51:10] <LocalPCGuy> oh, just trying to disable the button itself?
[18:51:15] <LocalPCGuy> sorry, thought it was a form
[18:51:29] <stribor> no no..i want to prevent form submission
[18:51:43] <coldhead> you are preventing it right now by not having a submit button
[18:51:50] <coldhead> so case closed
[18:52:10] <stribor> ??..not having submit button????
[18:52:19] <stribor> oh man now i am really lost...lol
[18:52:25] <coldhead> <input type="submit">
[18:52:29] <coldhead> good grief
[18:52:33] <coldhead> i'll do it for you
[18:52:40] <jaypitidi>  hah nvm $("nav a[href='"+newHash+"']").addClass("current active");
[18:52:45] <LocalPCGuy> that is true...if you want to do it just with JS you could do this:
[18:52:46] <LocalPCGuy> http://jsfiddle.net/5HTuv/46/
[18:53:09] <LocalPCGuy> but better to have an actual submit button and then prevent it from submitting until everything validates
[18:53:55] <coldhead> stribor: http://jsfiddle.net/5HTuv/47/
[18:54:22] <LocalPCGuy> ah..but don't use return false coldhead - better to use preventDefault
[18:54:30] <rchavik> do you guys override javascript's alert()? and if you do, what do you use?
[18:54:45] <coldhead> BITE ME, LOCALPCGUY
[18:54:49] <LocalPCGuy> lol
[18:54:52] <stribor> coldhead: hahahahaha
[18:54:52] <LocalPCGuy> http://jsfiddle.net/5HTuv/46/
[18:54:53] <stribor> lol
[18:54:58] <coldhead> no i agree, i just want this to be over with
[18:55:11] <stribor> no i am starting to like this
[18:55:13] <stribor> :)
[18:56:02] <coldhead> i am starting to like covering my body in vegetable oil
[18:56:13] <stribor> coldhead: lol
[18:56:27] <jaypitidi> ok that works but i can keep clicking link and they will all be active how do I keep just the actual active link with that class?
[18:56:37] <LocalPCGuy> rchavik nope, I just use  console.log() instead
[18:57:20] <coldhead> is it even possible to override alert()?
[18:57:34] <cub_> http://c0decub.com/Halp/ Anybody know how to fix the instant changing of images on second slide? To view source CTRL U and view <script> tags 	$active.removeClass('active last-active');
[18:57:43] <cub_> Also there's some stuff in the stylesheet related to #bg
[18:58:06] <cub_> Been trying to fix this for 6 hours
[18:58:13] <cub_> I think it's impossible
[18:58:38] <rchavik> LocalPCGuy, for real alert(), debugging alert(), i want to prettify it if possible
[18:58:41] <Murf_> hello all
[18:58:57] <LocalPCGuy> rchavik ah, look into a plugin called jAlert I think
[18:59:08] <LocalPCGuy> call that where you would call alert
[18:59:18] <cub_> Ah cool so nobody knows
[18:59:33] <Murf_> are there any plans for a better fixed header/footer while scrolling for jqm please? if not, are the bugs being addressed soon? for example, quite often the header/footer does not reappear after a scroll?
[18:59:56] <LocalPCGuy> cub_ I took a look, maybe if you simplified it into just a small jsfiddle and seperated it from the rest of the code?
[19:00:03] <cub_> i tried
[19:00:05] <LocalPCGuy> too much other stuff going on with JS in that page
[19:00:09] <cub_> this is what happend: http://jsfiddle.net/5HTuv/44/
[19:00:12] <LocalPCGuy> to give a quick answer
[19:00:13] <cub_> I think of everything
[19:00:20] <cub_> but yeah its pretty much impossible IMO
[19:00:27] <cub_> o fuk wrong link
[19:00:30] <cub_> excuse my language
[19:00:30] <LocalPCGuy> lol
[19:00:40] <LocalPCGuy> nah, I did something really close to that on this page:
[19:00:46] <cub_> http://jsfiddle.net/kza2c/4/
[19:01:07] <LocalPCGuy> http://bit.ly/omXxkZ
[19:01:15] <LocalPCGuy> (don't laugh, it's a hair care site)
[19:01:27] <cub_> ok
[19:01:36] <LocalPCGuy> at least, that seems like what you might be trying to do?
[19:01:42] <cub_> yeh
[19:02:27] <cub_> but background-image
[19:02:35] <cub_> because position:Relative; is vital
[19:02:40] <jaypitidi> $("nav a").removeClass("current active");  $("nav a[href='"+newHash+"']").addClass("current active");
[19:03:20] <jedimind> is there a simple way to determine on .scroll that you've reached the bottom ?
[19:03:22] <LocalPCGuy> cub_ why a BG image?
[19:03:31] <cub_> Set anything to absolute
[19:03:32] <cub_> on that slider
[19:03:43] <cub_> and it overflows on everything
[19:03:48] <cub_> positioning messes up
[19:03:49] <cub_> etc
[19:03:57] <LocalPCGuy> so you are setting a BG image on an img tag?
[19:04:00] <cub_> ye
[19:04:02] <LocalPCGuy> that ... seems wrong
[19:04:04] <cub_> it should be REALLY easy
[19:05:33] <LocalPCGuy> cub_ ok, couple things - either just set the SRC of the image tag or get rid of it
[19:05:43] <cub_> why
[19:05:44] <LocalPCGuy> I wouldn't set a BG image as the image of an img tag
[19:05:50] <cub_> it's inside a div
[19:05:51] <cub_> class
[19:05:52] <LocalPCGuy> just set the BG image on the bg div
[19:06:00] <cub_> huh
[19:06:02] <cub_> no point?
[19:06:06] <cub_> it'll procure the same thing
[19:06:12] <LocalPCGuy> it is needless markup if you aren't going to use it correctly
[19:06:20] <cub_> i don't check markup
[19:06:26] <LocalPCGuy> I can tell
[19:06:27] <cub_> takes too much time
[19:06:28] <LocalPCGuy> ;P
[19:06:36] <cub_> i mean, i can do it
[19:06:39] <denisbr> Hello all, I'm a brazilian guy and i'm developing a form where an user enter a decimal number. Well, the value can be in the american format (1222.50) or brazilian format (1.222,50). I wrote the code http://paste.lymas.com.br/2098 ... but when I enter 1,200.33 return 1.20033 How I solve it ?
[19:06:40] <cub_> but in all honesty nobody cares about markup
[19:06:43] <LocalPCGuy> that is a lot of the problem in this case
[19:06:51] <Murf_> cub_ if you dont want an alt tag on the img or have ti clickable/downloadable in a browser, get red if the <img> tag altogether and use a div
[19:06:55] <LocalPCGuy> except when it doesn't work, then you car
[19:07:04] <LocalPCGuy> care
[19:07:06] <cub_> uh
[19:07:12] <cub_> your missing the point though
[19:07:21] <cub_> but w/e
[19:07:50] <LocalPCGuy> an img tag is for displaying an img inline, not a BG image
[19:07:56] <Murf_> there is alot of chat going on her, how often can I repost a question per etiquette please?
[19:07:56] <cub_> ok
[19:07:57] <cub_> i did it
[19:08:01] <cub_> but yeh doesnt matter w/e but yeah um
[19:08:09] <cub_> problem still not fixed i guess loL
[19:08:20] <cub_> the real question is why would you leave a div tag empty
[19:08:27] <ajpiano> Murf_: they are always working on bugs
[19:08:28] <cub_> not why you would leave an image tag empty
[19:08:29] <LocalPCGuy> no that won't fix the issue
[19:08:34] <cub_> i know
[19:08:38] <LocalPCGuy> but it is one step of many
[19:08:40] <cub_> obviously but yeah
[19:08:41] <Jimchaos> join documentcloud
[19:08:41] <LocalPCGuy> towards fixing it
[19:08:50] <Murf_> ajpiano yes I am sure, but that one.. in particular.. hehe
[19:08:57] <cub_> theres a .delay() step
[19:09:09] <LocalPCGuy> delay won't work for that
[19:09:11] <denisbr> anybody?
[19:09:15] <cub_> ok
[19:09:18] <cub_>   .animate({opacity: 1.0}, 1000, function() {
[19:09:19] <LocalPCGuy> is the point to do cross-fade?
[19:09:20] <cub_> it animates though
[19:09:22] <cub_> Bingo...
[19:09:28] <ajpiano> Murf_: if you want to know about specific jqmobile bugs i would say to go to #jquerymobile-dev and be very specific about the bug you're talking about
[19:09:31] <LocalPCGuy> then you need 2 images
[19:09:34] <cub_> yes
[19:09:35] <ajpiano> perhaps try to see if there's a github issue for it, etc.
[19:09:37] <cub_> two background-images
[19:09:46] <Murf_> ahh sweet thanks
[19:09:47] <cub_> i just swap between the classes that contain those images
[19:09:57] <cub_> otherwise you cant have them overlay each other
[19:10:01] <cub_> without messing up positioning
[19:10:14] <cub_> position:absolute; is the only way and it doesnt overlay properly or fit well with the content
[19:10:15] <LocalPCGuy> you can just position 2 img tags directly on top of each other
[19:10:20] <cub_> i tried that
[19:10:23] <cub_> ^^
[19:10:35] <LocalPCGuy> then the code isn't right, because that works well for this kind of thing
[19:10:37] <cub_> but yeah essentially the only way is with background-image which isnt unethical at all really
[19:10:48] <cub_> yea
[19:10:53] <cub_> i just copy and pasta'd it from an older project
[19:11:18] <cub_> with position:absolute; but i know it's really easy to swap background-images with an animation
[19:12:31] <cub_> well w/e gonna ask stackoverflow
[19:12:35] <LocalPCGuy> cub_ you still need 2 elements, one for each image
[19:12:44] <cub_> Look at the source
[19:12:46] <cub_> I told you dude there's
[19:12:47] <cub_> background-image
[19:12:49] <cub_> on each #bg
[19:13:09] <cub_> each #bg class last-active and active
[19:13:17] <cub_> It adds the class active but
[19:13:18] <cub_> too soon
[19:13:24] <cub_> basically
[19:13:26] <cub_> trying to delay that
[19:13:29] <cub_> but  you cant i guess
[19:13:32] <cub_> so its impossible
[19:15:15] <LocalPCGuy> you are animating for 1000ms but calling setinterval every 500ms?
[19:15:27] <LocalPCGuy> err. 5000s, my mistake
[19:15:28] <cub_> 5000* and yes
[19:16:06] <LocalPCGuy> you need to animate it back to 0 and do the rest on a callback maybe...I'd do it a completely different way, so hard to say
[19:16:29] <cub_> Not a jquery Pro
[19:16:34] <jedimind> someone please help me out, im just trying to figure out when i've gotten to the bottom of a scroll area using .scroll()
[19:16:36] <jedimind> event
[19:18:52] <jedimind> why does $(this).scrollHeight return undefined?
[19:19:08] <cub_> anyway I knew the #jquery channel would dissapoint
[19:19:11] <cub_> disappoint*
[19:19:16] <cub_> embarassing myself now but yeah
[19:19:26] <Vinny> cub_: whats up?
[19:19:30] <cub_> just gonna go C+P something i guess
[19:19:32] <cub_> Well,
[19:20:05] <cub_> crappy irc client wont copy and paste sec
[19:20:08] <LocalPCGuy> it is your code that disappoints me
[19:20:08] <cub_> wow
[19:20:14] <cub_> i copied and pasted it
[19:20:20] <cub_> http://c0decub.com/Halp/
[19:20:22] <cub_> anyway
[19:20:29] <cub_> finally keyboard copied and pasted that URL
[19:20:30] <cub_> now uhh
[19:20:32] <Vinny> cub_: why copy pasta in a irc? jsbin that sheet
[19:20:40] <cub_> i tried
[19:20:45] <cub_> jsbin doesn't load animations
[19:20:54] <cub_> well probably does but idk i tried didnt work
[19:21:18] <Vinny> oh so you have an anim prob?
[19:21:36] <cub_> yes
[19:21:56] <ajpiano> jedimind: ahh
[19:21:56] <Vinny> seems to be not doing the timeout correctly
[19:22:01] <Vinny> or setInterval
[19:22:08] <ajpiano> i knew i figured this out recently, had to just trawl for it
[19:22:19] <jedimind> i ended up using .prop and it worked
[19:22:27] <ajpiano> yeah, scrollHeight needs to be on the dom element
[19:22:35] <ajpiano> to find out if it's at the bottom, it's something like msgPane[0].scrollHeight - msgPane.height() - msgPane.scrollTop()
[19:22:48] <cub_> i dont even know why im still in here LOL
[19:22:48] <ajpiano> where msgPane is a jquery object of something that has scrollbars
[19:22:51] <cub_> i just have a hope that somehow
[19:22:53] <cub_> i fix this problem
[19:23:14] <Vinny> cub_:  i don't know what your probz is but i think your animations are wonky right?
[19:23:17] <cub_> but yeah i think im on the right track with background-image
[19:23:19] <cub_> yes
[19:23:28] <cub_> if you look at the source within the <script> tags
[19:23:31] <cub_> there's a class that calls
[19:23:35] <cub_> add.active or whatever
[19:23:40] <LocalPCGuy> I would just stack regular images with position absolute and fade between them cub_
[19:23:40] <cub_> and that should be delayed
[19:23:49] <cub_> ok first of all dude
[19:23:50] <cub_> i just said like
[19:23:55] <cub_> over 9000 times i already did that
[19:23:56] <Vinny> cub_:  insteade of opacity change i would do a class change instead
[19:23:58] <cub_> and i don't need that garbage
[19:24:01] <cub_> because
[19:24:07] <LocalPCGuy> just fix the CSS then and you'd be good
[19:24:09] <cub_> position:absolute; messes up not only in markup
[19:24:14] <cub_> which whatever you hate or something
[19:24:20] <cub_> but it doesn't bode well with what i'm trying to do
[19:24:40] <cub_> its pretty ridiculous but there it is
[19:24:42] <LocalPCGuy> Vinny, he needs to do opacity for the animation
[19:25:04] <Vinny> LocalPCGuy: hmm i'll parooze it
[19:25:16] <LocalPCGuy> what you are trying to do is not particularly hard, but you have to set it up correctly first, and I don't think it is setup correctly as it is
[19:25:28] <cub_> the thing is
[19:25:30] <cub_> i know that
[19:25:33] <cub_> but there is no input being given here
[19:25:36] <cub_> just stating the obvious
[19:25:54] <cub_> i mean i'm not trying to be an ass or anything but there it is
[19:26:08] <Vinny> >.<
[19:26:08] <jedimind> ajpiano, do you know how to determine scrollbar width?
[19:26:17] <ajpiano> i actually do
[19:26:20] <ajpiano> have a snippet for that somewhere
[19:26:26] <ajpiano> 1 sec
[19:26:27] <jedimind> you are amazing
[19:27:34] <ajpiano> jedimind http://fixee.org/paste/1vxhj1r/
[19:29:44] <LocalPCGuy> cub_ there has been input given, but it was rejected :shrug:
[19:29:52] <cub_> i don't mean
[19:30:02] <cub_> input as in, stating what has already been stated
[19:30:13] <jedimind> ajpiano, hrmm
[19:30:18] <Vinny> cub_:  whats your reason behind an image with no markup?
[19:30:18] <cub_> i don't want to argue but basically your input isn't worthless it's just mostly not relevant
[19:30:24] <cub_> exactly not relevant
[19:30:31] <jedimind> ajpiano, will that cause a flicker of things being added / overflow triggered when the function is hit ?
[19:30:44] <cub_> my markup isn't relevant
[19:31:00] <ajpiano> jedimind: nope, never has for me
[19:31:09] <cub_> anyway i don't use position absolute for a few reasons i think they're fairly obvious
[19:31:19] <cub_> you can't use up white space with position absolute and half of the div will be hidden
[19:31:40] <cub_> so i use <img tags to set up proper relative positioning works just as well
[19:31:44] <LocalPCGuy> cub_ differing opinions - markup is very relevant to this kind of thing IMO, get that right and the other stuff becomes easier
[19:31:54] <cub_> ok
[19:32:54] <jedimind> ajpiano, one last question, got any tips on how you would approach having an overflow div's scroll snap to arbitrary value (say every 30 pixels)
[19:32:57] <saddishwasher> anybody use LimeChat on Mac OS X?
[19:34:08] <Vinny> cub_:  just create collection of images and iterate through a selected div
[19:34:15] <cub_> ok
[19:34:31] <Vinny> cub_:  but you knew that already right?
[19:34:36] <cub_> yes
[19:34:53] <Vinny> cub_: then why are you doing it like you are now? whats the logic behind that?
[19:34:56] <ajpiano> jedimind: pure conjecture... i would use a debounced scroll event, when it fires, i'd do something like var st = $(this).scrollTop(), $(this).scrollTop( st - st % 30 );
[19:35:07] <cub_> i told  you i don't know how to write that that's why im asking questions
[19:35:28] <cub_> but yeah ill just try that i guess

[19:35:53] <jedimind> ajpiano, i was thinking something along the same lines, but of course yours is cleaner
[19:36:13] <Vinny> that fn() you have is pretty refuctored
[19:36:53] <jedimind> ajpiano, btw that scrollbarWidth() doesnt seem to work in Chrome, always returns 0 :\
[19:37:52] <ajpiano> :/
[19:38:06] <ajpiano> i found it somewhere once upon a time, only used it back when i never supported webkits
[19:39:23] <LocalPCGuy> btw, just got tickets to Boston for the conference, first timer - any tips?
[19:39:37] <jedimind> LocalPCGuy, put on a chastity belt
[19:39:40] <jedimind> protip
[19:39:43] <LocalPCGuy>  lol
[19:39:55] <ajpiano> lol LocalPCGuy
[19:40:26] <jedimind> does anyone here know anyone that works at nclud ?
[19:40:28] <ajpiano> if this was the bay area conf my advice would be, skip lunch and go to in-n-out burger
[19:40:40] <jedimind> i just inherited a project that was bundled by them supposedly and id be interested to hear what happened
[19:41:32] <djQuery> ajpiano: hmmmmm in-n-out they just opened one in my area
[19:41:43] <ajpiano> you're out in CA?
[19:43:41] <djQuery> ajpiano: http://maps.google.com/maps?q=in-n-out+burger+allen+tx&hl=en&ll=33.129214,-96.653252&spn=0.057287,0.07699&sll=33.010521,-96.720253&sspn=0.014341,0.019248&z=14&iwloc=A
[19:43:58] <ajpiano> oh wow that's awesome they are in TX
[19:44:05] <ajpiano> it's so good
[19:44:27] <djQuery> well got 3 kinda in the dallas area anyway
[19:45:56] <djQuery> lloks like that is the furthest east
[19:46:32] <djQuery> no jsplumb  for me need to find another way of drawing the foriegn keys relationships in my project
[19:48:25] <jedimind> http://projects.pud.ca/s-trip/ i get a fun effect w/ the scroll area in chrome
[19:48:31] <jedimind> cuz it wont calculate scrollbarwidth
[19:48:32] <jedimind> :(
[19:48:48] <runa> so, I'm looking for a timeline plugin/widget/whatever. I've saw timeglider which seems too unstable, MIT SIMILE timeline which looks good, any other candidates or recomendations? tnx
[19:48:58] <djQuery> jedimind: looks fine in chrome 14
[19:49:07] <__machine> anyone in sydney australia looking for a job? :)
[19:49:25] <jedimind> djQuery, you dont see the scroll bar obstructed by the white gradient ?
[19:49:58] <djQuery> jedimind: nopers
[19:50:05] <jedimind> im on the pedestrian version 12 or so, i guess they'll sort it out in the next release or two
[19:50:06] <LocalPCGuy> I thought that was intentional
[19:50:08] <LocalPCGuy> hehe
[19:50:13] <LocalPCGuy> and kinda cool
[19:50:21] <jedimind> LocalPCGuy, it doesnt look bad, but it doesnt let you hit the down arrow
[19:50:26] <jedimind> until you scroll to the bottom and i remove the fade
[19:50:31] <LocalPCGuy> yah, probably not practical
[19:50:39] <djQuery> jedimind: I believe that you can install multiple versions at the same time
[19:50:54] <jedimind> djQuery, cuz i dont have enough browsers running here? :)
[19:51:23] <djQuery> jedimind: damn straight. if you aint at 15 browsers u aint got enough'
[19:52:24] <LocalPCGuy> how much diff are the scroll bar sizes?  seems like you could get it to within a pixel or two
[19:52:43] <LocalPCGuy> or set it hard-coded for chrome and adjust for the ones you can calculate for?
[19:53:35] <jedimind> also chrome is ignoring line height for placeholder text :(
[20:04:34] <cook1es> What is the selector to select input:text and textarea? $('input:text, textarea') doesn't work
[20:06:00] <ajpiano> that should certainly work
[20:07:23] <Chibby_> $('input[type="text"], textarea')
[20:08:10] <cook1es> (input:text, textarea) worked, my bad sorry >_< used value="" instead of <textarea>value</textarea>
[20:09:11] <Chibby_> is that documented somewhere in the api? i can't find it..
[20:09:18] <ajpiano> ?:text
[20:09:18] <bot-t> :text: Selects all elements of type text. http://api.jquery.com/text-selector/
[20:09:26] <Chibby_> ah found it
[20:09:28] <Chibby_> oh
[20:09:29] <Chibby_> thanks (:
[20:10:06] <Ogredude> I'm trying to get facebox to work to ajaxify my login form.  My submit button is not submitting the form via XHR, but by regular POST.  I've got this javascript that fires up on $(document).ready https://gist.github.com/1110895
[20:10:21] <Ogredude> please help me figure out where I'm going wrong, I've been beating my head against this for a couple hours
[20:11:00] <Ogredude> and yes, my submit button has the id user_session_submit
[20:11:21] <Ogredude> for some reason, it's just acting like a regular submit button, instead of making an xhr request
[20:12:33] <thinkt4nk> is that handler for reveal.facebok being fired?
[20:12:40] <thinkt4nk> s/k/x/
[20:12:53] <Ogredude> I don't know how to tell if it is or not.
[20:12:58] <thinkt4nk> console.log()?
[20:13:04] <Ogredude> ?
[20:13:08] <thinkt4nk> console.log()
[20:13:29] <bot-t> Ogredude, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[20:13:31] <thinkt4nk> alert(), whatever your preferred method of notifying the client is
[20:13:59] <Ogredude> bot-t:  excellent
[20:14:02] <bot-t> Ogredude, Excellent jQuery Plugin! | jQuery Plugins - Hi, http://plugins.jquery.com/content/excellent-jquery-plugin
[20:14:33] <Ogredude> yeah this is the problem I'm facing with Javascript.  I have only a vague idea what I'm doing in it to begin with, and absolutely no idea where to start with debugging.
[20:14:52] <ajpiano> Ogredude: hopefully that preso will help you :)
[20:15:06] <Ogredude> thinkt4nk:  yes, it is being fired.
[20:15:25] <Ogredude> I'm going to go look at that presentation and then see where I am.
[20:15:58] <thinkt4nk> well, the handler for submit takes the event as an argument
[20:16:21] <Ogredude> thinkt4nk:  ok, so the handler for reveal.facebox is getting fired but the handler for submit is not.
[20:16:23] <thinkt4nk> you can take event, name it as e, and invoke e.preventDefault() if you want to preclude the form from submitting
[20:16:39] <Ogredude> ah okay
[20:16:44] <thinkt4nk> no, it likely is, but it's not doing what you expect
[20:17:09] <Ogredude> that was odd.
[20:17:36] <Ogredude> thinkt4nk:  could you give me that last line again, please?
[20:17:53] <thinkt4nk> sure, I said it likely is being fired, but it's not doing what you expect
[20:18:07] <Ogredude> well I told it to console.log() in there and I get nothing in my log
[20:18:14] <Ogredude> so what was that to prevent the default behavior?
[20:18:39] <Ogredude> pass the function that submit() fires the event as e, and then my xchat crashed
[20:18:45] <thinkt4nk> you get nothing in your log, or is firebug clearing after the post request
[20:18:47] <thinkt4nk> ?
[20:19:00] <Ogredude> ah, it's clearing.
[20:19:05] <thinkt4nk> ;)
[20:19:10] <thinkt4nk> you can make it persist
[20:19:29] <Ogredude> I'm actually in chrome devtools
[20:19:50] <thinkt4nk> you need to take the event argument in the post handler, name it whatever (often just named 'e'), and invoke preventDefault() if you want to stop the form from submitting
[20:20:43] <Ogredude> ok
[20:21:08] <Ogredude> so if I understand correctly, I $('#user_session_submit').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); more stuff; });
[20:22:44] <thinkt4nk> precisely
[20:23:01] <thinkt4nk> oh, and that selector
[20:23:11] <thinkt4nk> that's the selector of the form element, not the submit input, right?
[20:24:03] <Ogredude> it's supposed to be the form element?
[20:24:09] <thinkt4nk> yup
[20:24:13] <Ogredude> let me change that, it's probably the problem.
[20:25:40] <Ogredude> zomg it works, and I'm back to Rails exceptions.  Those are easy.
[20:25:58] <thinkt4nk> ;)
[20:26:04] <Ogredude> also, thanks for the link to the debugging presentation, bot-t, I'm only partway through and it's already incredibly useful
[20:26:12] <ajpiano> heehe :)
[20:26:18] <ajpiano> bot-t: is just a bot :)
[20:26:18] <bot-t> ajpiano, Yes.
[20:26:19] <Ogredude> I knew it had to be something I was doing wrong.
[20:26:31] <Ogredude> I'd assumed that the .submit action was needing to be tied to the submit button
[20:27:03] <thinkt4nk> no, it's semantically valid, when you think about it
[20:27:09] <thinkt4nk> you submit the form, not the submit button
[20:30:45] <Ogredude> ok, that totally makes sense.
[20:30:58] <Ogredude> so much of javascript does not make any sense at all to me that it's really hard to step back and look at things sensibly
[20:31:10] <Ogredude> if most of it is gibberish, I can't easily pick out the bits that I already know
[20:34:40] <thinkt4nk> whoa, I hope you're not suggesting that javascript is mostly gibberish
[20:34:41] <thinkt4nk> lol
[20:34:59] <Ogredude> it is if you've never learned it properly
[20:35:13] <Ogredude> it does some amazing things, that's for sure.  But I don't know how to read or write in it yet.
[20:35:29] <Ogredude> I'm at the "tourist phrasebook" stage. :)
[20:35:32] <mystline> get practising Ogredude :3
[20:36:11] <thinkt4nk> I see what you're saying, yes it can be confusing until you dig into it
[20:43:02] <Ogredude> also, I lean on my test suite a LOT, and I feel like I'm flying blind when I'm working in javascript
[20:43:02] <danieliser> im building a web app and am using a lot of modal windows so i have a function to open them but is there an easy way to manage all the callbacks for the different forms inline? so i dont have to keep them in the main js file?

[20:44:27] <saddishwasher> bot-t: are you gay?
[20:44:28] <bot-t> saddishwasher, Reply hazy, try again.
[20:44:29] <ajpiano> ?bot-t
[20:44:29] <bot-t> sentient but living in the machine locale.
[20:44:31] <saddishwasher> lmao
[20:44:38] <saddishwasher> LMAO!
[20:44:46] <Assimilater> hey does anyone know what scott means by this? http://forum.jquery.com/topic/datepicker-issues-on-m5
[20:46:15] <saddishwasher> bot-t: where do you live?
[20:46:16] <bot-t> saddishwasher, Without a doubt.
[20:46:30] <Assimilater> bot-t: is that near the land of doubt?
[20:46:30] <bot-t> Assimilater, Most likely.
[20:46:33] <bot-t> the machine locale, obviously. i just said that.
[20:47:14] <Assimilater> ajpiano? Any guesses on ^^?
[20:47:25] <ajpiano> Assimilater: line breaks are free, you should consider including them in your source html
[20:47:26] <saddishwasher> Assimilater: where are you getting these questions from? lol
[20:48:14] <ajpiano> why are you including the css for both 1.9m5 and 1.8.14 ?
[20:48:19] <Assimilater> ajpiano: aye, my current setup strips out whitespace at the end of my php scripts, i've never cared for the most part because firebug indents most
[20:48:27] <Assimilater> ajpiano: 1.8.14 is my custom styling
[20:48:44] <Assimilater> ajpiano: (colors and fonts and whatnot, made with themeroller)
[20:48:51] <ajpiano> ah
[20:50:02] <saddishwasher> ?eval ( $(1).add(2).add(3) == 6,00001 ) ? 'woot' : 'fail';
[20:50:03] <bot-t> saddishwasher: "woot"
[20:50:07] <saddishwasher> anyone know why this is true?
[20:50:07] <WGM240Lite> Anyone know if you can take the results of a php if/then statement (with 2 values in each array item) and pass it to jquery code?
[20:50:27] <shesek> ?eval $(1).add(2)
[20:50:28] <bot-t> shesek: [1, 2]
[20:50:51] <shesek> ?eval $(1).add(2).add(3) == '1,2,3'
[20:50:51] <bot-t> shesek: false
[20:50:58] <shesek> ?eval ''+$(1).add(2).add(3)
[20:50:58] <bot-t> shesek: "[object Object]"
[20:50:59] <Assimilater> ?eval $(1).add(2).add(3)
[20:51:00] <bot-t> Assimilater: [1, 2, 3]
[20:51:10] <saddishwasher> see...wtf
[20:51:14] <shesek> ?eval ''+$(1).add(2).add(3).get()
[20:51:14] <bot-t> shesek: "1,2,3"
[20:51:15] <Assimilater> ?eval 6,00001
[20:51:15] <bot-t> Assimilater: 1
[20:51:29] <Assimilater> ?eval 1 == [1, 2]
[20:51:29] <bot-t> Assimilater: false
[20:51:37] <ajpiano> Assimilater: well, to answer your direct question, i have no idea what he's talking about there... you clearly included the css before the script
[20:51:46] <shesek> ?eval $(1) == 1
[20:51:47] <bot-t> shesek: false
[20:51:56] <Assimilater> ajpiano: ya, i didn't think it would make a difference
[20:52:00] <shesek> ?eval $(1).add(2).add(3) == 1
[20:52:00] <bot-t> shesek: false
[20:52:02] <Assimilater> ajpiano: i can tell no difference really
[20:52:08] <ajpiano> it definitely does make a difference
[20:52:14] <ajpiano> he's right that css needs to be included before script
[20:52:15] <shesek> ?eval ( $(1).add(2).add(3) == 6,00002 )
[20:52:16] <bot-t> shesek: 2
[20:52:21] <ajpiano> but ,you are doing that...
[20:52:28] <kborchers> Assimilater: what exactly is your issue? i do not see the datepicker when the page loads. maybe i'm not understanding your problem
[20:52:31] <Assimilater> ajpiano: i wasn't (in the head element we are talking, righ?)
[20:52:34] <shesek> ?eval (1==2,3)
[20:52:34] <bot-t> shesek: 3
[20:52:40] <Assimilater> wel it's not there entirely....
[20:52:40] <ajpiano> oh
[20:52:41] <shesek> oh
[20:52:43] <Assimilater> there's a little sliver
[20:52:44] <ajpiano> yes
[20:52:45] <Assimilater> at the bottom left
[20:52:52] <ajpiano> you should only have your style elements in the head
[20:52:54] <Assimilater> that goes away when you click the datepicker
[20:52:56] <ajpiano> yeah, i see that, that's clearly th eprob
[20:52:58] <shesek> the first expression returns false, it just returns the part after the ','
[20:53:12] <kborchers> ah i see
[20:53:13] <saddishwasher> lol
[20:53:16] <Assimilater> ajpiano: that was primarily @ kborchers
[20:53:21] <ajpiano> ah
[20:53:33] <Assimilater> i should use tab more :P
[20:53:34] <ajpiano> does that happen if you pull in the latest datepicker from git
[20:53:40] <saddishwasher> so basically if $(1).add(2).add(3) == 6 is false then return 000001
[20:53:59] <Assimilater> i'm running the js from m5, i'm not sure how i could pull only the datepicker from git
[20:54:04] <Assimilater> actually
[20:54:04] <ajpiano> oh dudde... you... are not doing that
[20:54:08] <datarecall> will ajax let you post to a different domain ?
[20:54:09] <Assimilater> doing what?
[20:54:10] <shesek> No, even if its true it'll return 000001
[20:54:14] <ajpiano> you're using git from july 20th
[20:54:18] <shesek> now, here's the real question
[20:54:20] <shesek> ?eval (![]+[])[+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]]+([![]]+[][[]])[+!+[]+[+[]]]+(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]]
[20:54:21] <bot-t> shesek: "fail"
[20:54:21] <Assimilater> i am?
[20:54:26] <ajpiano> yep
[20:54:30] <shesek> (credit to wtfjs.org)
[20:54:37] <Assimilater> i downloaded that like last week from the jquery url with git
[20:54:39] <Assimilater> w/e it was
[20:54:44] <ajpiano> i know
[20:54:44] * Assimilater consults bookmarks
[20:54:45] <ajpiano> i was there
[20:54:46] <ajpiano> :p
[20:54:49] <Assimilater> oh
[20:54:50] <saddishwasher> shesek: lol
[20:54:56] <ajpiano> i mean, look at the page, you're including jquery-ui-git.js
[20:55:04] <shesek> (http://wtfjs.com/2010/07/12/fail)
[20:55:05] <Assimilater> right
[20:55:06] <ajpiano> it is decidedly there
[20:55:18] <Assimilater> but that's from june 20th?
[20:55:23] <Assimilater> oh wait you said july
[20:55:24] <shesek> that's some crazy stuff
[20:55:30] <Assimilater> ...
[20:55:41] <ajpiano> just keep those fingers typing :D
[20:55:49] <Assimilater> lol
[20:56:02] <ajpiano> Assimilater: fwiw, you're technically supposed to load *all* css before jQuery
[20:56:09] <ajpiano> but that shouldn't impact this
[20:56:14] <Assimilater> ?eval fwiw
[20:56:14] <bot-t> Assimilater: ReferenceError: fwiw is not defined
[20:56:18] <Assimilater> lol
[20:56:35] <ajpiano> for what it's worth
[20:56:45] <Assimilater> got ya
[20:56:47] <ajpiano> Assimilater: well you can obviously get the latest.. latest...
[20:56:57] <ajpiano> http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.js
[20:57:04] <ajpiano> not sure if that'll fix it
[20:57:11] <ajpiano> i would try grabbing the datepicker from actual 1.9m5 as well
[20:57:42] <ajpiano> Assimilater: you can pull in the datepicker from any other version by putting it in its own file, or taking the its own file you already have, and just including it after the library where it was originally included
[20:57:49] <ajpiano> it will overwrite the existing definition
[20:58:14] <Assimilater> or save as git-2
[20:58:28] <ajpiano> not sure why you would do that
[20:58:39] <Assimilater> in case there's more functionality loss
[20:58:42] <ajpiano> you're not in the business of stockpiling arbitrary builds of jquery ui from random points in time
[20:58:52] <ajpiano> whatever you want  :)
[20:59:09] <ajpiano> like i said, i'd also try the 1.9m5 datepicker as well
[20:59:28] <kborchers> Assimilater: also fwiw, it is most likely something else going on in your page as the latest datepicker by itself does not have that issue http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/datepicker/default.html
[20:59:29] <ajpiano> oh hum
[20:59:36] <ajpiano> datepicker hasn't really changed much i don't think :/
[21:00:05] <ajpiano> Assimilater: i am suspicious of some of the other datepicker extensions you're using on the page
[21:00:08] <ajpiano> and them still working just right
[21:00:13] <Assimilater> kborchers: see i would, but the milestone menus didn't quite work right
[21:00:22] <Assimilater> ajpiano: what do you mean
[21:00:51] <ajpiano> nm :/
[21:01:17] <ajpiano> ooh i have an idea
[21:01:17] <ajpiano> hm
[21:01:35] <Assimilater> ajpiano: just put the newest git on
[21:01:37] <Assimilater> same problem
[21:02:16] <Assimilater> though i don't see any excessive functionality loss
[21:02:32] <ajpiano> yeah i doubt anything would have changed in datepicker in the last week, all the datepicker work is happening in a branch
[21:03:19] <chewed-on> Hi guys.
[21:03:27] <chewed-on> I have this piece of code
[21:03:29] <ajpiano> Assimilater: you gotta take off this line stripping thing
[21:03:46] <ajpiano> it's impossible to put a breakpoint BEFORE you init datepicker and then follow what happens after
[21:03:46] <Assimilater> ajpiano: k i'll turn it off temp
[21:03:50] <ajpiano> because there are no linebreaks
[21:04:20] <Assimilater> k that should do it
[21:04:32] <Ogredude> hot damn, it works now!  Thanks so much thinkt4nk and bot-t for the help, it was exactly what I needed.
[21:04:44] <ajpiano> uhh
[21:04:45] <chewed-on> $.ajax({type:"GET",url:"nav.xml",dataType:"xml",success:parseXML});  and I also have a function declared like so var parseXML = function(xml) { â€¦ }   but my code isn't working. I want to pass a function callback to success using a name instead of typing success: function(xml) { . . . } ;
[21:04:50] <thinkt4nk> glad to help!

[21:04:59] <ajpiano> one of the best ways to do that
[21:05:03] <ajpiano> is to close your </head> tag
[21:05:05] <ajpiano> :/
[21:05:12] <thinkt4nk> lol@bot-t & Ogredude
[21:05:13] <kborchers> lol
[21:05:13] <Assimilater> it is closed
[21:05:15] <saddishwasher> lmao -5 geek points
[21:05:16] <saddishwasher> lol
[21:05:19] <Assimilater> it's just not on a new line
[21:05:22] <ajpiano> oh something else is borked in there
[21:05:40] <chewed-on> Am I doing function call back right
[21:05:41] <chewed-on> ?
[21:05:44] <ajpiano> you see how the syntax highlighting gets all wacky
[21:05:47] <ajpiano> something is clearly off
[21:06:19] <Assimilater> it does?

[21:08:21] <saddishwasher> bot-t I hate you
[21:08:23] <ajpiano> Assimilater: why don't you have this code in a document ready block
[21:08:37] <ajpiano> and instead just have it suck into the middle of the dom
[21:08:57] <WGM240Lite> Does anyone know if php statement results can be "passed to" jquery?
[21:09:03] <Assimilater> ajpiano: because i didn't think i needed it at the time, because some of the data for that datepicker is passed in with php and because it made no difference when i moved it
[21:09:30] <saddishwasher> WGM240Lite: put your jquery script in the <head> tags of your .php page
[21:10:48] <saddishwasher> ?g "cookie monster no want to delete cookies"

[21:10:49] <Assimilater> ajpiano: the same code used to work on ui 1.18.3
[21:10:52] <WGM240Lite> saddishwasher: but can you pass a specific statement to jquery? http://codepad.org/GTzqjo8C (this is the if statement)
[21:10:56] <saddishwasher> !Success
[21:10:57] <Assimilater> ajpiano: in case it helps...
[21:11:07] <ajpiano> hm
[21:11:34] <ajpiano> Assimilater: i can't help but get this feeling that the fact that you're getting the datepicker showing in a random part of the dom is that it's being inserted before teh DOM is finished rendering
[21:12:31] <saddishwasher> WGM240Lite: I don't see what the problem is...
[21:12:35] <Assimilater> ajpiano: i would have no way of knowing...i've wrapped it in a $(document).ready() before
[21:12:55] <ajpiano> Assimilater: it's a better practise to
[21:12:58] <kborchers> Assimilater: could you humor us and try it again
[21:13:06] <Assimilater> kborchers: always willing to humor
[21:13:07] <ajpiano> put all your code at the end of the body in a script tag
[21:13:08] <WGM240Lite> saddishwasher: There is no problem.  I just want to pass the results of that php if statement into jquery so I can create tooltips
[21:13:11] <Assimilater> well maybe not always
[21:13:14] <ajpiano> omg WGM240Lite
[21:13:26] <ajpiano> you can't change your nick 3 times in 1 day and keep asking the same question
[21:13:29] <ajpiano> :/
[21:13:35] <Assimilater> ajpiano: like outside of the wrapper? ... that will be.... difficult with my php organization
[21:13:40] <saddishwasher> WGM240Lite: the print?
[21:13:42] <ajpiano> like yeah
[21:13:53] <Assimilater> ajpiano: i can put it in sucesses.php if you like
[21:14:01] <Assimilater> as it is
[21:14:02] <ajpiano> i don't even know what that means
[21:14:06] <ajpiano> i said the bottom of the body :p
[21:14:08] <Assimilater> externally linked script
[21:14:11] <Assimilater> sigh...
[21:14:12] <ajpiano> still don't care
[21:14:15] <Assimilater> ok
[21:14:50] <ajpiano> oh man
[21:14:58] <ajpiano> he completely bailed
[21:14:59] <ajpiano> wtf.
[21:15:02] <kborchers> lol
[21:15:03] <Assimilater> who?
[21:15:11] <ajpiano> wgm240whatever
[21:15:15] <saddishwasher> yea I know
[21:15:16] <ajpiano> i:/
[21:15:21] <kborchers> should we take guesses at his next nick?
[21:15:27] <ajpiano> it's like
[21:15:29] <ajpiano> you can change your nick
[21:15:30] <saddishwasher> just as I was about to type: rtfm
[21:15:42] <ajpiano> but you can't change your poorly marked up weird php and oddly phrased question
[21:15:50] <saddishwasher> lol
[21:15:51] <Assimilater> ok hopefully i don't have to do this in the final thing
[21:15:52] <Assimilater> haha
[21:15:54] <ajpiano> i was going nuts
[21:15:55] <Assimilater> ajpiano: updated
[21:16:12] <ajpiano> i was like IS TODAY "PASS A PHP ARRAY TO JQUERY DAY?"
[21:16:30] <saddishwasher> ajpiano: you've seen that question before today?
[21:16:41] <Assimilater> saddishwasher: i've seen it a couple times
[21:16:44] <saddishwasher> lol
[21:16:51] <saddishwasher> was I wrong in my suggestion?
[21:16:54] <ajpiano> another time today, AND i spend like a bunch of time exlpaining a solution to the same question last night to a DIFFERENT nick than eithe rof those
[21:16:55] <ajpiano> :/
[21:16:59] <saddishwasher> I don't know of another way...
[21:17:14] <ajpiano> saddishwasher not necessarily
[21:17:32] <ajpiano> it's just that like, if you have information like that, you shouldn't be just generating js in php and glomping the data in like that
[21:17:50] <ajpiano> there are much more elegant ways where it's actually bound to the part of the dom you are gonna need to access it from
[21:17:57] <ajpiano> i was trying to explain that last night
[21:17:58] <ajpiano> :/
[21:18:02] <kborchers> Assimilater: would you mind just wrapping that in $(document).ready so i can stop thinking that's the issue?
[21:18:09] <saddishwasher> ajpiano: besides putting the results in a hidden div and getting the results like var myphpresults = $('#hiddendiv').text();
[21:18:13] <Assimilater> kborchers: sure
[21:18:14] <ajpiano> yeah man you gotta doc ready bra
[21:18:31] <ajpiano> saddishwasher,yea of course not that
[21:18:38] <saddishwasher> yea thats ugly
[21:18:45] <Assimilater> kborchers: updated
[21:18:52] <ajpiano> saddishwasher, if it's a tooltip, he should be like, putting the tooltip information inside of the title attribute
[21:19:00] <saddishwasher> I did that one time long ago out of necessity but don't recommend it
[21:19:10] <kborchers> hmmm
[21:19:24] <saddishwasher> ajpiano: in the DOM when page loads..
[21:19:37] <ajpiano> what?
[21:20:12] <saddishwasher> ajpiano: your talking about putting tooltip information in title attribute of the DOM element
[21:20:24] <ajpiano> ...right
[21:20:31] <saddishwasher> ok, on the same page...
[21:20:49] <Assimilater> oh that was a question of clarification :P
[21:21:32] <Assimilater> ajpiano: kborchers: any other ways i may humor you today?
[21:21:37] <Assimilater> :)

[21:31:52] <saddishwasher> ajpiano: Assimilater: ps -aux is how you view currently running proceses and then your grep-ing for anything containing 'ajpiano'...so that fits the comment "what are your thought processes?"
[21:32:02] <seancurtis> ^
[21:32:15] <Assimilater> ah
[21:32:52] <saddishwasher> I just looked up and saw that I'm watching TMZ about Tu-Pac
[21:33:12] <saddishwasher> or 2-Pac if you prefer
[21:33:28] <saddishwasher> ^ thats what his hommies called him
[21:34:10] <saddishwasher> lol http://www.motivationals.org/demotivational-posters-23801
[21:34:19] <ajpiano> Assimilater: i would try leaving your code with the linebreaks in and make sURE you've moved ALL your css above ANY scripts
[21:34:42] <ajpiano> Assimilater: all those <link rel="stylesheet" href="....php"> are css, they should be before script in your head
[21:34:51] <Assimilater> huh
[21:34:53] <ajpiano> and then once you've done that
[21:35:22] <ajpiano> reply in the forum saying, i have moved everything, and i'm still getting it inserting the datepicker in the DOM when it initially connects it, look at the bottom fo the dom
[21:35:33] <ajpiano> Assimilater: http://callserver.dyndns.biz:89//Styles/StyleMaster.php?file=Table
[21:35:47] <ajpiano> pages like that that are STYLESHEETS are in fact.. STYLSHEETS and have to be loaded BEFORE JQUERY
[21:36:03] <Assimilater> ajpiano: that was a huh of "odd" not "what"
[21:36:25] <ajpiano> sorry hon we aren't there on understanding each other's grunts yet i guess
[21:36:26] <ajpiano> :/
[21:36:28] <ajpiano> :p
[21:36:34] <Assimilater> lol
[21:37:53] <kborchers> Assimilater: it is because you are using both the m5 and 1.8.14 css
[21:38:05] <ajpiano> :/
[21:38:08] <ajpiano> well done kborchers
[21:38:28] <saddishwasher> yes ?hi5 @ kborchers
[21:38:33] <saddishwasher> oops
[21:38:39] <saddishwasher> ?hi5 @ kborchers
[21:38:40] <bot-t> kborchers, âµ
[21:39:10] <kborchers> the m5 has ui-datepicker class with display:none but then 1.8.14's ui-helper-clearfix has display:block overriding it
[21:41:47] <Assimilater> kborchers: hmm....i want the colors and fonts, how can i know which styles to trim out so it doesn't affect layout?
[21:42:04] <kborchers> don't use m5 in production ;)
[21:42:27] <Assimilater> well i need the use of the menu....

[21:43:12] <ajpiano> saddishwasher what did your nick used to be
[21:43:24] <saddishwasher> its sadmicrowave on my other computer
[21:43:33] <saddishwasher> I'm still signed in under that
[21:43:35] <ajpiano> oh i thought someone was just emulating you
[21:43:39] <saddishwasher> .seen sadmicrowave
[21:43:40] <hsbot> sadmicrowave was seen 6 hours, 56 minutes and 55 seconds ago, in #jquery, saying: draginx, out of curiosity, why are you doing .bind('mouseenter' and 'mouseleave') instead of using .hover()?
[21:43:55] <ajpiano> saddishwasher, you know you can register your nickname and kick your other self off right :p
[21:43:56] <wookiehangover> always saddishwasher and assimilator, talking some late night shit
[21:44:11] <Assimilater> ?
[21:44:17] <saddishwasher> yea...?
[21:44:25] <saddishwasher> ajpiano: yea I know :)
[21:44:35] <Assimilater> he didn't even have the decency to spell my name right and he called my questions ...
[21:45:16] <ajpiano> you brigand
[21:45:18] <wookiehangover> Assimilatorr: i think I improved it
[21:45:33] <kborchers> Assimilater: seriously though, you could probably get away with just removing ui-helper-clearfix from 1.8.14 css since it's covered in m5 css and that should fix your issue
[21:45:46] <saddishwasher> wookiehangover: please use the tab key to auto complete nick names if you arn't going to make sure they are spelled right
[21:46:05] <wookiehangover> sadistwasher: wut?
[21:46:39] <saddishwasher> there we go again
[21:46:42] <kborchers> i think i might change my name to sadistwasher

[22:13:59] <versatiletech> interesting
[22:29:24] <madprops> how can I make a div with visibility:hidden show up for a few seconds? im trying something like setTimeout(function(){$("#login_feedback").fadeOut("slow")}, 1000);
[22:31:34] <Cork> madprops: $("#login_feedback").fadeIn("slow").delay(1000).fadeOut("slow") ?
[22:39:23] <madprops> how can I make it fade in, and then fade out after a couple of seconds? im trying 				$("#login_feedback").fadeTo(0,0).css('visibility','visible').fadeTo(600,1);	$("#login_feedback").fadeOut(0,0).css('visibility','visible').fadeOut(1000,1);
[22:42:58] <uptownben> Hi All
[22:43:51] <uptownben> So I am using JQuery to parse some XML, my parse traverses well, but the returned objects are __proto__, ??
[22:45:00] <versatiletech> uptownben: jsfiddle.net your code
[22:53:37] <devinrolsen> evening all
[22:53:50] <versatiletech> good morning :)
[22:55:29] <madprops> how can i make this stick longer? $('#login_feedback').css('visibility','visible').fadeTo('10', 0); any change in the speed makes no effect
[22:59:16] <versatiletech> madprops: try fadeTo( 10, 0 )
[22:59:42] <fabiobik> hi guys
[22:59:44] <versatiletech> the speed is in milliseconds, not seconds
[22:59:53] <versatiletech> just in case you didn't know that
[22:59:56] <fabiobik> how to get the state of this .slideToggle
[23:00:21] <fabiobik> i mean when open i want to display an specific text, and when its close i want to display other
[23:02:18] <versatiletech> ?slideToggle @ fabiobik
[23:02:18] <bot-t> fabiobik, .slideToggle([duration], [callback]): Display or hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[23:02:37] <madprops> any idea why this works just once $('#login_feedback').css('visibility','visible').fadeTo(1000, 0); ?
[23:02:40] <versatiletech> check for display: none
[23:03:15] <versatiletech> if it's true the DOM element is "closed", if not it's open
[23:04:40] <madprops> versatiletech, i tried something like this yet it doesn't work $('#login_feedback').css('visibility','visible').fadeTo(1000, 0,function(){$('#login_feedback').css('display','inline')});
[23:05:58] <fabiobik> versatiletech u there mate
[23:06:29] <fabiobik> http://clica.programais.com/contactos.php On first    "Ver mapa" click on it
[23:06:44] <madprops> i read fadeTo doesn't add a display
[23:07:01] <fabiobik> when opens the map changes the text ok
[23:07:14] <fabiobik> but when close dont restore to original state
[23:07:18] <fabiobik> what i need to do?
[23:07:47] <versatiletech> madprops: what effect are you trying to achieve?
[23:08:58] <madprops> versatiletech, i want the div, which is set to visibility:hidden to fade in for a while then fade out
[23:09:11] <versatiletech> fabiobik: works fine for me on FF3.6
[23:09:26] <versatiletech> wait
[23:09:47] <fabiobik> versatiletech i guess you dont understand what i need
[23:09:55] <versatiletech> oh ok, now I understand
[23:10:36] <fabiobik> versatiletech i want something like   when user click on "Open map"  that text will change to "Close map"  and when its done return to "Open map"
[23:11:23] <fabiobik> i mean when click again in close map will change to open map
[23:11:40] <versatiletech> ?toggle @ fabiobik
[23:11:41] <bot-t> fabiobik, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[23:11:53] <versatiletech> use that instead of a click
[23:13:47] <versatiletech> that's one solution
[23:14:52] <madprops> versatiletech, strange it works here http://jsfiddle.net/2xdLX/1/  maybe because jsfiddle is not saving the state http://jsfiddle.net/2xdLX/1/
[23:15:02] <versatiletech> the other would be to just test the string for "Open map", if it's true, then change it to "Close Map", otherwise change it to "Open Map"
[23:15:44] <cook1es> How do I prevent .hover() from running if it's already running? http://jsfiddle.net/PzG3p/3/ Thanks!!!
[23:18:24] <devinrolsen> cookles, huh? I fail to understand the question, even after visiting your link.
[23:18:53] <versatiletech> madprops: http://jsfiddle.net/2xdLX/2/
[23:20:12] <cook1es> devinrolsen: To reproduce, hover over the #blogmenu quickly several times, it will continue the amount of times you have hovered. I want to prevent that
[23:20:37] <versatiletech> cook1es: http://jsfiddle.net/PzG3p/4/
[23:21:05] <versatiletech> animations get queued
[23:21:35] <cook1es> versatiletech: awesome! is it possible to make it animate its full thing so it doesnt stop immidiently?
[23:22:02] <cook1es> or actually i probably dont want that, nevermind
[23:22:05] <madprops> versatiletech, will display:none mess my template_
[23:22:07] <madprops> ?
[23:22:19] <devinrolsen> yes cookles
[23:22:25] <devinrolsen> http://jsfiddle.net/PzG3p/5/
[23:22:42] <devinrolsen> this will finish the fade but also prevent build up.
[23:23:24] <cook1es> devinrolsen: cool! thanks. atleast I know if I'll ever use it :p
[23:24:31] <uptownben> So, I'm doing an ajax get to load in an XML doc, but when I send that loaded xml into $.parseXML(), I keep getting a "Document is empty" error. when I console.log the xml, it is there, what would cause that?
[23:24:33] <versatiletech> madprops: depends. If the element should be occupying space, but just be invisible, then yes it will mess up your template.
[23:24:48] <Paganini> devinrolsen I'm very new to jquery, but wouldn't it be better to have the animation stopped by default with the opacity and then on hover start animate? just thinking if you had a few of them running it could be lower overheads? (slightly)
[23:25:12] <Paganini> devinrolsen oh hang on
[23:25:23] <Paganini> devinrolsen it is stopped after the animation my bad sorry :)
[23:25:28] <devinrolsen> ;)
[23:25:38] <Paganini> devinrolsen when I said very new I meant it :D
[23:25:44] <devinrolsen> welcome
[23:25:54] <madprops> versatiletech, yeah im planning to put stuff below that and i dont want it to move while the animation goes on, is that fixable?
[23:26:48] <madprops> oh nvm
[23:26:55] <madprops> thanks
[23:27:14] <versatiletech> madprops: figured it out?
[23:28:16] <fabiobik> how to select an p from an div
[23:28:24] <fabiobik> parent
[23:28:26] <madprops> versatiletech, i wont add anything below it
[23:28:29] <fabiobik> something like that
[23:28:37] <versatiletech> or http://jsfiddle.net/2xdLX/3/
[23:28:44] <fabiobik> i want to select an p from an specific div
[23:29:01] <devinrolsen> $('div.specific p').whatever
[23:29:24] <fabiobik> devinrolsen can i use this p ?
[23:29:36] <versatiletech> fabiobik: depends on a lot of variables
[23:29:42] <devinrolsen> define use.
[23:29:44] <coldhead> in general yes
[23:30:17] <fabiobik> $(this p)
[23:30:20] <versatiletech> if $(this) represents the div, and you want the p in that div, do $(this).find('p')
[23:30:34] <coldhead> $('p
[23:30:36] <coldhead> er
[23:30:40] <coldhead> $('p', this)
[23:30:51] <Paganini> devinrolsen sorry to be a pain, but can .css('opacity') only be used in css3?
[23:30:59] <versatiletech> that will find all p's in the div
[23:31:04] <devinrolsen> I prefer coldhead method :)

[23:33:36] <fabiobik> when user decise to close the map that text should go again to Ver mapa

[23:34:10] <zenger> $('#id').slideUp(500, function() { your callback ]);
[23:34:11] <zenger> yes
[23:34:18] <versatiletech> yes
[23:34:27] <fabiobik> slideup?
[23:34:38] <devinrolsen> Paganini, well the ability to set transparency or opacity has been around for a while (filters and such). But yes I believe a universal opacity rule for all venders is css3.

[23:35:23] <Paganini> devinrolsen I know it was more of a css question but still, I'd be a little cautious to rely on it, although within jquery animate maybe it'll be fine...
[23:35:41] <fabiobik> im not understanding
[23:35:43] <fabiobik> ....
[23:35:47] <fabiobik> really
[23:35:52] <versatiletech> ok
[23:36:00] <Paganini> thanks devin
[23:36:01] <versatiletech> ?toggle @ fabiobik
[23:36:01] <bot-t> fabiobik, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[23:36:19] <versatiletech> have a look at the example
[23:37:20] <versatiletech> the first handler will change the text to "Close Map" and call slideToggle(), the second handler will change the text to "Open Map" and call slide Toggle()
[23:37:21] <zenger> fabiobik: I think you should have better used .text() or .html instead
[23:38:37] <fabiobik> versatiketech can you doo me an example on figgle

[23:45:34] <zenger> so guys how can I make an each loop but not consecutive ?
[23:45:41] <zenger> .each()
[23:46:53] <devinrolsen> fabiobik, if your markup was setup properly you could also do this much faster: http://jsfiddle.net/zSrvS/

[23:51:24] <MattKelly> is there a workaround for the (seemingly) lack of support for multi-dimensional arrays being passed to 'data' in $.ajax();?
[23:54:33] <versatiletech> MattKelly: nested objects?
[23:55:07] <MattKelly> versatiletech: yeah
[23:55:30] <fabiobik> versatiletech http://clica.programais.com/contactos.php
[23:55:40] <fabiobik> its working now :P
[23:56:20] <fabiobik> thanks one more time
[23:56:21] <fabiobik> :P
[23:56:24] <versatiletech> I haven't serialized one, but I'm sure it wouldn't be much of a hassle to create a utility function if doesn't already serialize nested objects
[23:56:35] <versatiletech> fabiobik: :)
[23:57:29] <MattKelly> I tried YAHOO.lang.JSON.stringify, but doesn't seem to be working
