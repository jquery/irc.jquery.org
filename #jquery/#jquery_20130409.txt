[00:00:08] <nesoi> cork: $('#recipientsList').on('tap', '.ui-btn', function(e){
[00:00:16] <Cork> tap?
[00:00:48] <Cork> nesoi: are you generating that from a framework?
[00:00:49] <nesoi> tap is supposedly the non-delay version of click, but it's being slow in this instance
[00:00:56] <nesoi> no framework
[00:01:00] <Cork> there isn't a tap event
[00:01:10] <nesoi> there is in jqm
[00:01:10] <Cork> at least not as far as i know
[00:01:23] <nesoi> which is a framework, I suppose
[00:01:37] <Cork> ah, yes jqm generates tap events
[00:02:02] <Cork> so you have a mixture of touchstart and click, and you might be getting click on the listbox
[00:02:07] <Cork> not sure
[00:02:42] <Cork> (and yes jquery mobile is a framework)
[00:02:46] <nesoi> the listbox is popping up the keyboard, so it is getting focus at least
[00:03:37] <innociv> What is a good IDE for Javascript with syntax checking besides Netbeans?
[00:03:41] <innociv> And not eclipse based?
[00:03:56] <raj> Cork, is i t a bad idea to have many $(document).on('click', '.morespecificselector', function() {...})
[00:04:27] <raj> where everything is initially bound to document
[00:04:40] <Cork> raj: the point of it is that you don't need multiple, but no its not worse then having multiple event listeners on any other elements
[00:05:03] <raj> i don't need multiple?
[00:05:05] <raj> what do you mean?
[00:05:10] <coldhead> innociv: js2-mode for emacs
[00:05:38] <Cork> raj: unless you didn't mean to include the '.morespecificselector' as specific string matching
[00:05:45] <raj> i did
[00:05:56] <Cork> raj: if that selector differs its as its meant to be
[00:05:58] <innociv> Haha.
[00:06:01] <innociv> People always say that
[00:06:15] <Cork> raj: if its the same for each listener, its pointless
[00:06:21] <raj> right
[00:06:24] <raj> it's different
[00:06:33] <raj> i'm just concerned about binding like 20 eventhandlers to document
[00:06:43] <raj> ...even though each  has a more specific selector within .on()
[00:06:57] * coldhead is people
[00:07:35] <Cork> innociv: vim and sublime text is quite nice
[00:07:57] <Cork> (or rather gvim and sublime)
[00:08:27] <raj> Cork, are you telling me that's a useless concern if i have a more specific string selector in .on()?
[00:08:32] <coldhead> oh yes, i make people use sublime
[00:09:01] <Cork> raj: i don't really see the point of these questions
[00:09:25] <Cork> raj: its event listeners just like any other
[00:09:26] <raj> so I can design my code better
[00:09:37] <Cork> it has the same cost as any other event listeners
[00:09:49] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:09:51] <raj> Cork, but it's very easy to just listen to everything bound to document and then be more specific
[00:10:02] <innociv> sublime looks pretty nice
[00:10:07] <Cork> the only difference is that the higher in the stack you add an event listener the less likely it is to be removed
[00:10:22] <raj> be removed?
[00:10:34] <raj> by who?
[00:10:38] <raj> *whom
[00:10:43] <Cork> sigh
[00:10:58] <Cork> events added to document will more or less never be removed
[00:11:05] <nesoi> so does anyone else have an idea how to stop a textarea which is underneath a popup from being selected when a button on the popup on top of it is tapped?
[00:11:07] <Cork> so you have to remember to remove them when you don't need them
[00:11:15] <nesoi> I don't see how to do this with css...
[00:11:22] <raj> ah, right
[00:11:44] <raj> thing is, I want to know whether anything other than the target was clicked, so I can run an action
[00:11:56] <raj> oh, hmm, that won't happen with the more specific selector
[00:12:14] <Andrew_R> Cork: I am looking into getters and setters a little more (just for research) and  __defineGetter__() is depreciated, but it's replacement seems to be more limited in what it can do, at least when it comes to working with the built in objects.
[00:12:15] <Andrew_R> http://jsfiddle.net/EGy3C/
[00:12:20] <raj> ok, i need to rethink this a little since clickoutside doesn't seem to work with my scheme
[00:12:25] <Cork> raj: $(document).one('click', function() { /* outside */ });
[00:12:42] <Andrew_R> the first try doesn't work because navigator.userAgent already exists
[00:13:13] <Cork> Andrew_R: the replacement to __define*__ isn't the inline
[00:13:19] <Cork> its defineProperty
[00:13:29] <Cork> ?mdc Object.defineProperty

[00:16:58] <Andrew_R> I find this "what's next" stuff interesting.
[00:17:52] <Cork> Andrew_R: in ie ya
[00:18:15] <Andrew_R> oh yeah, I missed that part
[00:18:50] <Cork> i love the compatibility part :)
[00:18:55] <Cork> ie: (8, but only on DOM objects and...)
[00:19:05] <Cork> safari: (5, but not on DOM objects)
[00:19:08] <Cork> :D
[00:21:00] <Andrew_R> cool: http://jsfiddle.net/EGy3C/2/
[00:22:28] <coldhead> guaranteed not to work everywhere
[00:22:35] <Andrew_R> oh course
[00:22:40] <Andrew_R> *of
[00:23:42] <Andrew_R> I'm just messing around with stuff that I might be able to use in another 5 years. :)
[00:24:09] <Cork> Andrew_R: actually ie9< only have another year to live
[00:24:32] <Cork> as winxp dies in 2014
[00:25:21] <resting> how can i assign an object to a property in an object? something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/resting/xY46J/1/
[00:26:12] <Cork> resting: only guessing but prob something like this http://jsfiddle.net/xY46J/2/
[00:28:42] <resting> Cork: hm..no luck
[00:32:25] <Cork> resting: is the $.plot returning the object with the clearSelection function?
[00:32:51] <Andrew_R> resting: what errors are you getting in the console?
[00:33:32] <Andrew_R> Cork: resting's problem would be a good candiate for a getter property :)
[00:33:43] <Cork> Andrew_R: no, not really
[00:33:53] <resting> hm..let me try something..
[00:34:03] <Cork> as far as i understand it he just want to store an object
[00:35:35] <Andrew_R> myObj.flot = { get plot: function() { return $.plot(graph, data, options); } };  would call the $.plot method every time, but would give the syntax he wants
[00:35:50] <Andrew_R> resting: that code is no good unless you don't care about IE < 9
[00:38:32] <nesoi> what's a good way to figure out if it's possible to speed up jquery stuff? I am thinking of some kind of profile trace indicating how long everything is taking and how frequently things are happening
[00:39:09] <Cork> Andrew_R: actually that would be a strange thing, as your creating the response as a value
[00:39:31] <resting> thanksâ€¦but i ended using the = assignmentâ€¦like myObj.flot.plot = $.plot() and it works..except i can't keep my assignment code in the object declaration itself..
[00:39:56] <Andrew_R> Cork: I messed up the syntax
[00:40:01] <Cork> resting: the reason the original code didn't work is prob cause the variables didn't exist there
[00:40:23] <Cork> Andrew_R: and its kinda pointless as it calls the initialization code every time
[00:40:49] <Cork> (don't overuse the new toy just cause its new :P)
[00:41:07] <Andrew_R> hey, I'm not going to use it at all :)
[00:41:29] <Cork> then don't tell others to do it
[00:41:48] <resting> Cork: hm..my fault i didn't show the full code but the variables were thereâ€¦
[00:43:12] <someprimetime> yo Cork
[00:43:15] <someprimetime> how can I do this:
[00:43:16] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/KuFmx/
[00:43:42] <someprimetime> I want to return the `data` object from the ajax callback within my callback that I pass to _ajaxCall()
[00:43:59] <someprimetime> right now it's just returning the `data` object from within callback()
[00:44:32] <Cork> var call_data = data;
[00:44:39] <someprimetime> ah so just rename it
[00:44:44] <Cork> yes
[00:44:48] <someprimetime> and pass in call_data to callback()?
[00:44:51] <someprimetime> k thanks
[00:45:00] <Cork> or just change the name of the original argument variable
[00:48:11] <someprimetime> not sure if this will work
[00:50:10] <Andrew_R> resting: if you're still interested in setting up the method without having to add myObj.flot.plot = $.plot() to your code, here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/xY46J/4/
[00:50:18] <Andrew_R> I confirmed this only call $.plot() once
[00:51:02] <Cork> Andrew_R: but why add the extra complexity?
[00:52:01] <Andrew_R> he said he can't keep his assignment code in the object declaration itself, so this might be what he wants
[00:52:27] <Cork> Andrew_R: and that depends on something else
[00:52:49] <Cork> and your code will call the plot code each time .flot is passed
[00:54:36] <Andrew_R> actually, it doesn't, http://jsfiddle.net/xY46J/5/ - I added an alert("called") inside the plot function and 3 calls to myObj.flot.plot.clearSelection(); and it only shows "called" once
[00:55:51] <Cork> hmm that is a bit freakish
[00:55:59] <Cork> not sure why
[00:55:59] <seutje> MLU
[00:56:18] <Andrew_R> closures
[00:56:45] <Cork> Andrew_R: but what makes the myObject.flot variable in the main scope?
[00:57:03] <Cork> ah
[00:57:13] <Andrew_R> myObj.flot is set to the results of the function call
[00:57:18] <Cork> missed that you used a self executing function
[00:57:26] <Andrew_R> yep
[01:03:10] <seutje> guys, I need some common issues I can use as examples
[01:09:24] <resting> Andrew_R: hmâ€¦so i tried making `plot` a function and returning the object in itâ€¦.seems to work too..calling myObj.flot.plot() is as good as calling its clearSelection() function..so i guess it works in my case.
[01:10:40] <Andrew_R> resting: so you have something like plot: function(){ $.plot(graph, data, options).clearSelection(); } ?
[01:12:13] <resting> Andrew_R: plot: function() { return $.plot(graph, data, options); }â€¦plotting the graph kinda resets everything, so i don't really need to call the clearSelection afterall
[01:14:33] <Andrew_R> doesn't that redraw the "plot" though too?
[01:19:41] <resting> Andrew_R: erm..ya..but its not noticeable..
[01:23:03] <Andrew_R> you are using the flotcharts.org plugin? it looks like $.plot() returns an object. You could do something like var plot = $.plot(graph, data, options); then later, call plot.clearSelection();
[01:27:35] <resting> Andrew_R: ya..that was my goal actuallyâ€¦but i was trying to get that var plot into my object..
[01:28:10] <Cork> resting: could you paste the related code for the assignment?
[01:29:44] <resting> this is what i'm using for now..
[01:29:50] <resting> myObj.flot = {
[01:29:51] <resting>     plot: function () {
[01:29:51] <resting>        return $.plot(graph, data, options);
[01:29:51] <resting>     }
[01:29:51] <resting> }
[01:30:44] <Cork> resting: i meant could you generate a testcase in jsfiddle where myObj.flot = { plot: $.plot(graph, data, options); }; doesn't work?
[01:30:47] <Cork> cause that should work
[01:31:13] <Cork> (unless it runs too early)
[01:35:05] <resting> Cork:  somehow its complaining Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token .
[01:35:32] <Cork> resting: a testcase please
[01:35:53] <Cork> as long as everything needed to experince the problem is there its all i need
[01:36:35] <Zitter> Any hint on why it doesn't trigger "click" event on a.delete after dragging some files into DIV? http://test.prosolution.it/upload_image/index.html
[01:37:29] <resting> Cork: hm..ok..might as well..
[01:38:19] <Andrew_R> there is an extra semi-colon that is probably causing the unexpected token error, should be myObj.flot = { plot: $.plot(graph, data, options) };
[01:38:31] <Cork> Zitter: user delegation, $('#drop-files').on('click', 'a.delete', function() {});
[01:38:44] <Cork> ah, right that would be my fault
[01:39:38] <Cork> Zitter: also, your divs doens't match up, you're missing a closing </div>
[01:43:44] <Zitter> Cork, it works, thanks! Do you have a link on why I have to use that syntax instead of node.bind('click') ?
[01:44:09] <Cork> Zitter: $('') runs the selection when that function is called
[01:44:16] <Cork> Zitter: it builds a list of elements
[01:44:26] <Cork> and then .build adds an event listener to each of those elements
[01:44:32] <Cork> *bind
[01:44:50] <Cork> Zitter: that means that even if you add a new element that matches that selector, it won't have an event listener
[01:44:59] <Cork> and there for won't work
[01:45:23] <Cork> Zitter: if you instead add the listener to a parent, and listen for bubbling events and a selector (delegated event listeners)
[01:45:51] <Cork> it will find one element, and then listen for all bubbling events of the even type, that matches the selector (even newly added ones)
[01:46:40] <Zitter> OK, thanks again. Save this text for reference :)
[01:50:32] <resting> Cork: here's a simple 1â€¦not sure why it doesn't plot though..http://jsfiddle.net/resting/e5jwq/
[01:58:28] <fuzai> http://jsfiddle.net/MQvPV/  http://dev.neurobots.net/console/update_sayings.html  Can anyone explain to me why my submit button doesn't look like the jquery-ui submit button on my page?
[01:58:46] <Cork> resting: that flot object doesn't have any clear functions
[01:59:27] <Cork> fuzai: have you ran .button() on them?
[01:59:40] <fuzai> i think so
[01:59:49] <fuzai> i copied from the jqueryui demo
[02:00:02] <fuzai> and made it work in fiddle and pretty much copied it in
[02:00:23] <fuzai> i've got it working on other pages with <button> but this is the first time i've used a submit
[02:00:31] <Cork> ugg
[02:00:38] <Cork> fuzai: don't use document.write
[02:00:53] <fuzai> what should i use instead?
[02:01:06] <Cork> give it an id and just set the value
[02:01:17] <resting> Cork: hmâ€¦right..i think i need to add the selection pluginâ€¦not sure where its hosted online though..
[02:01:19] <fuzai> ok
[02:01:24] <Cork> $('#magic_key').val(getMagickey());
[02:01:40] <fuzai> hmmm ok
[02:01:51] <fuzai> ty :)
[02:02:18] <Cork> fuzai: that isn't an answer to you're question though :)
[02:02:28] <fuzai> oh
[02:02:40] <fuzai> hehe i just updated it to button submit by id
[02:02:55] <fuzai> and yea that didn't work
[02:03:30] <Cork> fuzai: no i meant this part document.write('<input type="hidden" name="magic_key" value="'+getMagicKey()+'">');
[02:03:35] <fuzai> yea i figured it out
[02:03:44] <fuzai> i figured out what you mean i mean
[02:03:51] <fuzai> i still haven't gotten submit to work
[02:03:57] <fuzai> i mean it works
[02:04:04] <fuzai> it just doesn't have the jquery-ui button
[02:04:46] <Cork> fuzai: ya, the part about document.write is cause its a VERY error pron things to use; and your much better of not using it
[02:04:54] <Cork> (as there is absolutely no need for it)
[02:05:10] <fuzai> it's what i figured out from googling
[02:05:20] <fuzai> and it's pretty much been copied from previous pages that did work
[02:05:28] <fuzai> but i understand what you are saying
[02:05:37] <Cork> ah, you have a js error in init.js
[02:05:47] <Cork> and that prevents js from executing
[02:05:56] <fuzai> hmmm
[02:05:57] <fuzai> ok
[02:06:05] <Cork> TypeError: $.localScroll is undefined
[02:06:05] <Cork> http://dev.neurobots.net/js/init.js
[02:06:05] <Cork> Line 10
[02:06:16] <Cork> gah, stupid line breaks
[02:06:16] <fuzai> i'm not sure why thats even in there honestly
[02:06:19] <fuzai> let me remove it
[02:07:11] <fuzai> yea i'm not sure where i pulled that from, i was really tired the other night writing this
[02:07:13] <fuzai> ty :)
[02:07:41] <Cork> fuzai: but, you really REALLY, R-E-A-L-L-Y should replace that document.write line
[02:07:54] <fuzai> I will
[02:07:58] <fuzai> baby steps :)
[02:08:02] <Cork> :)
[02:08:29] <fuzai> so basically just make it like i would a normal form element and then on dom ready redo the val?
[02:08:40] <Cork> yes
[02:08:44] <fuzai> ok ty
[02:09:25] <fuzai> ok that looks alot better ty
[02:09:41] <Cork> yw
[02:12:02] <fuzai> is there an easy way to to change the form file input field to something that looks more jquery-ui themed?
[02:12:08] <fuzai> i've been googling and not having any luck
[02:12:21] <amaroks> fuzai: css?
[02:12:24] <Cork> fuzai: not cross browser
[02:12:31] <fuzai> i'm firefox only
[02:12:37] <fuzai> thanks to a chrome bug
[02:12:48] <Cork> there has historically been real limitations to how much you can theme form fields
[02:12:55] <Cork> especially file inputs
[02:12:58] <fuzai> ok
[02:13:05] <fuzai> well if it's something complex it's not a big deal
[02:13:06] <Cork> and firefox has been (and is) the strictest of them all
[02:13:34] <fuzai> ok
[02:13:38] <Cork> fuzai: there is a hack one can use that involves a lot of faking, and it doesn't solve the cursor
[02:13:41] <Cork> but it is doable
[02:14:03] <fuzai> Firefox is the only thing that handles my websockets with open shift correctly and has that nifty calc() feature
[02:14:20] <seutje> I thought safari was even stricter in regards to propagating clicks to file inputs
[02:14:23] <fuzai> it's ok it's not the end of the world if it doesn't flow
[02:14:44] <Cork> seutje: no webkit lets you style an input file field
[02:14:49] <seutje> I guess u could overlay an image and pointer-events: none; but it would still be fiddly and won't work everywhere
[02:14:54] <Cork> actually
[02:15:05] <Cork> fuzai: i think you can fake a click on a input file field
[02:15:18] <Cork> and i THINK that should work in all fairly modern browsers
[02:15:41] <Cork> so just use a button and do $('#inputfile').click()
[02:16:24] <fuzai> ty :)
[02:16:27] <Cork> i know it landed in firefox somewhere around ff5
[02:16:59] <Cork> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36619
[02:17:18] <Cork> ha, it even landed in ff4
[02:19:21] <seutje> I remember trying that a while back and I think it was safari that didn't allow me to fake a click on a file input
[02:19:43] <seutje> I could be tripping though, I get that a lot
[02:19:58] <Cork> can't actually say
[02:20:21] <Cork> will have to look into that in a few weeks though, i have a new file uploader on the way :)
[02:24:12] <pehlert> Hey folks, does it make sense to store a jquery enhanced object ($(window)) in a variable, or is it optimised enough so that I can just call $(window) every time?
[02:24:12] <seutje> well aren't you fancy? :P
[02:24:49] <seutje> pehlert: for window it won't make that much difference, but it's good practice to cache all selectors u'll be needing again and aren't dynamic
[02:25:38] <Cork> ya, all you save on $(existing_dom_object) is the jquery wrapper code
[02:25:38] <pehlert> seutje: Okay, that helped already, thank you
[02:25:56] <Cork> so it is quite fast to begin with; its when you give it a string that it slows down
[02:26:25] <pehlert> Oh, okay.. So for objects its not required, but for string selectors it is?
[02:26:31] <seutje> it's more for those $('[attr*="something"]:not(.foo):eq(17)') sort of things
[02:26:32] <Cork> yes
[02:26:58] <pehlert> I was expecting that, but it's good to have it confirmed. Thanks guys
[02:27:03] <seutje> it's never "required", but generally a good practice
[02:27:14] <Cork> pehlert: though you do safe things even for objects, but its normally so little that it doesn't matter; it's more about readability there
[02:27:23] <Cork> safe==save
[02:28:09] <pehlert> Cork: That's why I was asking in the first place.. $(window) is a bit easier to understand than a jqwindow variable
[02:28:28] <Cork> var $window = $(window); ?
[02:28:29] <seutje> I tend to prepend my jQuery collections with a dollar sign
[02:28:33] <seutje> yeah, like that
[02:29:20] <pehlert> Oh that's a really good practice in factz
[02:29:43] <pehlert> Never considered doing that, but I will from now on! Thanks
[02:29:46] <Cork> depends how common it is that you use jquery objects
[02:30:03] <Cork> it can be quite meaningless if almost everything you do is jquery objects
[02:30:11] <Cork> but normally it helps
[02:30:42] <seutje> some ppl dislike it because it resembles Hungarian notation, but yeah... screw those ppl :P
[02:30:49] <pehlert> It doesn't hurt, even if most of the variables are prepended like that
[02:31:03] <seutje> it prevents my coworkers from re-jQuerying jQuery collections
[02:33:39] <lobbin> I'm having trouble with white flashes when changing pages on jQuery Mobile as a webapp on iOS. Seems only to happen when using transition none.
[02:38:31] <fabioportieri> what is the WYSIWYG that does the best job on pasting from word?
[02:39:02] <Cork> ckeditor has a special paste function for word
[02:40:09] <fabioportieri> thanks Cork noted
[02:40:36] <fabioportieri> i'm using redactor but  i can't seem to find paste from word functionality, that appear in yiibooster site
[02:46:17] <fabioportieri> http://yiibooster.clevertech.biz/components.html#forms
[02:49:17] <ladislaw>  i'd like to add a scroll function to a navbar, how do i do this?
[02:49:32] <Cork> scroll function?
[02:49:44] <Cork> you mean scrollbars?
[02:50:59] <ladislaw> yes
[02:51:52] <ladislaw> Cork: I have a horizontal bar with content... i'd like to add a scroll function for the content that does not fit in the bar
[02:52:34] <Cork> ladislaw: if you want to fake it, you add a button absolutely for the scroll action, and overflow: hidden; on the bar
[02:52:47] <Cork> and when the button is clicked, you change the scrollLeft value on the bar
[02:53:02] <ladislaw> i see
[02:53:15] <Cork> there is loads of other ways to do it too
[02:55:44] <church_> googlenews?
[02:55:58] <church_> google_news?
[03:20:15] <varnie> hello!
[03:21:03] <varnie> is it possible to add an event handler to $.appendTo? I.e. I want to perform some action when some HTML item has been appended.
[03:21:15] <Cork> no
[03:21:16] <varnie> Or is it meaningless?
[03:21:32] <Cork> you can add a wrapper around appendTo, but...
[03:23:19] <varnie> I am just trying to catch a bug related to $.i18n plugin. it doesn't work sometimes (doesn't give me translations). The code where it is used looks like the following: "$.tmpl("foo", {bar: "lala}).appendTo($(".fred")); $(".some_class_which_is_in_the_templ_above").i18n();"
[03:23:42] <varnie> so I thought maybe it is related to the $.appendTo method...
[03:24:15] <finnnnnnnnnnn> can I use this on an anchor tag?    input.on('click, change', function(e) { });
[03:24:18] <Cork> most likely not, as it just calls a native dom append function
[03:24:39] <Cork> finnnnnnnnnnn: sure
[03:24:46] <Cork> change won't do anything though
[03:25:04] <finnnnnnnnnnn> Cork: that's what I though, seems to be broken in my project. I'll set up a fiddle to test
[03:29:02] <daslicht> how do i set the val() of a input which works in Chrome ?
[03:29:09] <finnnnnnnnnnn> Cork: nope, doesn't work. Am I doing something wrong? - http://jsfiddle.net/bqVgY/
[03:29:23] <daslicht> -> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/fDZry/ not working on chrome but in any other browser
[03:29:41] <daslicht> i tryed it with date string or date object , it fails anytime
[03:29:57] <daslicht> is there a solution ? besides replacing the whole element ?
[03:30:59] <Cork> finnnnnnnnnnn: its 'click change' not 'click, change'
[03:31:05] <finnnnnnnnnnn> ahh, thanks
[03:31:08] <finnnnnnnnnnn> silly mistake
[03:32:48] <Cork> daslicht: your adding an invalid date
[03:32:56] <daslicht> why?
[03:33:09] <Cork> daslicht: and most browsers doesn't support type="date" so you get type="text"
[03:33:25] <Cork> daslicht: 2013-04-09 is a valid date 2013-4-9 isn't
[03:33:37] <daslicht> oh
[03:33:40] <daslicht> let me try
[03:33:53] <daslicht> gosh
[03:33:58] <daslicht> so easy
[03:34:19] <daslicht> but why is this now text : 2013-4-9
[03:34:20] <daslicht> ?
[03:34:29] <superdo> hi
[03:34:54] <superdo> if I have the following data back from server, how to use it in js?  http://hastebin.com/korexiquma.xml
[03:35:10] <Cork> daslicht: http://jsfiddle.net/fDZry/4/
[03:35:25] <superdo> $.each drops error: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for '374' in..
[03:36:40] <daslicht> Cork: ok fine! do you please like to explain me more into depth about that most browsers do not support the date property
[03:37:07] <daslicht> so if a browser do not support the date type the input will have the type text ?
[03:37:36] <Cork> daslicht: <input name="something" value="123"> === <input type="text" name="something" value="123">
[03:37:46] <Cork> type="unknown" is dropped
[03:37:59] <daslicht> aha
[03:38:40] <daslicht> ahh now i see
[03:38:40] <Cork> so you will only get type="date" as browser implements it
[03:38:46] <Lucky--> managed to compile my entire site down to 1. a div tag, and 2. a js script insert. oh and some ascii art in the body :-)
[03:38:50] <daslicht> chrome supports the type date
[03:38:55] <daslicht> the other not
[03:38:58] <daslicht> thats why
[03:38:59] <daslicht> cool
[03:39:03] <daslicht> that feels good
[03:39:05] <daslicht> thanks
[03:39:07] <Cork> yes type="date" is the least supported option
[03:39:22] <Cork> it has quite good support in mobile
[03:39:28] <Cork> but a lot less in desktop
[03:45:00] <daslicht> there is no builtin date function which returns a date as 2 digits ? no ?
[03:45:11] <daslicht> date.getDate().toString()
[03:45:14] <daslicht> but 01 not 1
[03:45:15] <daslicht> :)
[03:45:22] <daslicht> or do i have to do it by hand?
[03:45:35] <daslicht> jusrt curious before adding unsmart things
[03:52:18] <ladislaw> Cork: what i'm i missing? http://jsfiddle.net/ZTQBp/
[03:55:28] <Cork> ladislaw: heh, you made me confused there for a second by not including jquery :)

[04:08:17] <the_dark_knight> Hi, Here - http://d3js.org/ , it says that W3C DOM API is tedious. Is he talking about jquery?
[04:09:40] <fabioportieri> jquery is excellent for dom manipulation

[04:13:43] <fabioportieri> no idea

[04:23:12] <simius> Try: on line 3, remove the first +, then add a space between ' and title
[04:23:45] <simius> is 'comdey' a variable or supposed to be a string? (on line 18)
[04:24:48] <ladislaw> Cork: How would scroll in the other direction?
[04:24:51] <WHTM> A string I guess?
[04:24:58] <WHTM> I'll give it a go
[04:24:59] <WHTM> thanks
[04:25:13] <simius> missing either " or ' if a string
[04:26:24] <WHTM> Sweet that worked, thanks simius

[04:27:47] <simius> WHTM, are there always 6 entries in the xml?
[04:28:03] <WHTM> for this section yes
[04:28:22] <WHTM> I have to do something similar later on when I count all the entries in each genre
[04:28:35] <WHTM> and populate them all
[04:29:08] <simius> aye, just be carefull with magic numbers, easy to forget them when making changes to the data files :)

[04:38:20] <Cork> ladislaw: reducing the scrollLeft value
[04:38:30] <ladislaw> tried that
[04:38:34] <Cork> ladislaw: if you mean how to go past 0, you can't
[04:38:51] <ladislaw> not past but to 0
[04:39:13] <Cork> prop('scrollLeft', 0); should work just fine
[04:39:24] <ladislaw> i'll try it again

[04:42:52] <fulminator> can someone please help me on this one: http://jsfiddle.net/FqGME/
[04:43:30] <ladislaw> ah
[04:43:55] <simius> you might want to say what it is you want to happen and/or is not happening, fulminator
[04:44:45] <fulminator> well, I just wrote the question inside the fiddle
[04:45:00] <fulminator> how to check for dropped div on another div?
[04:46:46] <seutje> fulminator: okay, suppose I'll just guess then
[04:46:46] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/FqGME/2/
[04:48:00] <fulminator> ty seutje! that's all I wanted, really
[04:48:17] <fulminator> I couldn't find the right comparation
[04:48:42] <seutje> fulminator: hang on, there's still a booboo in there
[04:49:45] <fulminator> but... it's working... :)
[04:52:51] <seutje> fulminator: there's a variable leaking into the global scope and once an elements dropped data has been set, it will never be unset
[04:53:02] <seutje> then again, for this use-case, that doesn't rly matter
[04:54:10] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/FqGME/3/
[04:54:55] <seutje> flipped it around the the droppable gets put into the draggable's "dropped" data instead of the other way around
[04:55:14] <seutje> also made it a reference to the DOM element instead of the jQuery wrapped one
[04:55:34] <fulminator> ty
[04:56:10] <fulminator> how could you tell there was a variable leaking into global?
[04:57:10] <seutje> fulminator: http://jsfiddle.net/FqGME/2/ line 41
[04:57:18] <seutje> (it was my code btw, not urs)
[04:58:03] <seutje> first I was trying to make an example with a scoped variable, but the draggable's stop handler is called after the droppable's drop handler anyway, so no use
[04:58:40] <seutje> guess u could unset on the out handler
[05:04:59] <superdo> can I split an object into two parts?
[05:19:46] <dan2k3k4> How would I recreate a "World of Goo" style loading page? Basically a line of content is added every few seconds to show what it's loaded/what it's currently loading ?
[05:19:59] <dan2k3k4> I assume I would use delays
[05:35:59] <anli> I want to post to another page, is there a form of $.post that also navigates?
[05:36:07] <anli> I dont want form tags
[05:41:33] <philhutchinson> form tags?
[05:44:10] <Giusuppe> use jQuery.post and add your data in the data-option...
[05:44:47] <seutje> think he wants a regular pageload
[05:44:56] <seutje> like as if u would press submit on a form but without the form
[05:45:44] <church_> anyone know how to get cufon fonts to work after a jquery event
[05:46:50] <seutje> anli: all POST solutions I see either use ajax and redirect afterwards or they just generate a fake  form and .submit() that
[05:47:06] <anli> I append one
[05:47:17] <anli> Would be great if jquery included that so I dont have to do it myself :)
[05:47:27] <anli> Not that it is many lines or so
[05:47:38] <seutje> would be great if jQuery cured cancer, but it's out of scope for the project
[05:48:12] <anli> That comment was out of the scope for the discussion ;)

[06:46:07] <mauriyouth> hello
[06:46:21] <mauriyouth> is append async in firefox?
[06:46:22] <fengjie> why "(function f(){          function f(){ return 1; }               return f();             function f(){ return 2; }           })();" returns 2?
[06:46:28] <fengjie> why "(function f(){          function f(){ return 1; }               return f();             function f(){ return 2; }           })();" returns 2?
[06:46:43] <fengjie> I'm quite curious of this problem.
[06:47:15] <xec_> mauriyouth: you're talking about the .append() method?
[06:47:25] <xec_> mauriyouth: if so, i doubt it..
[06:47:40] <xec_> what makes you ask?
[06:47:41] <terrid> Hi all
[06:47:44] <fengjie> do you have any idea?
[06:47:50] <mauriyouth> xec_: yes
[06:48:20] <fengjie> After super, I'm doing quiz  in this website http://alpteam.pl/IT/js_quiz/ for fun..
[06:48:24] <xec_> fengjie: hoisting. function declarations are hoisted to the top (before the execution of f() )
[06:48:26] <fengjie> Then I met this problem.
[06:49:01] <mauriyouth> xec_: nice shot, hoisting,only the last def take effect
[06:49:14] <juxta> I am using $.getJSON() from within a class, and want to reference the class instance variables in the callback function - how do I do so?
[06:50:01] <mauriyouth> juxta: this
[06:50:28] <juxta> mauriyouth: I tried that - I thought that would be specific to the callback function though?
[06:50:28] <fengjie> I don't think the inner f() inside the outer f() is been delcared.
[06:51:44] <terrid> I was wondering if someone could help me with loading data via ajax?
[06:51:59] <mauriyouth> juxta: sava this before the callback and pass it to the cb (that = this, cb(that))
[06:52:00] <juxta> mauriyouth: my code looks like this: http://pastebin.com/SrWHiaPw, and the move method is complaining that this.marker is undefined...
[06:52:15] <juxta> mauriyouth: ahh. good idea.
[06:52:18] <juxta> thanks :)
[06:52:24] <fengjie> xec_: you are right

[06:55:51] <fengjie> There's very interesting problem here: "function f(){ return f; }           new f() instanceof f;" what will it return?
[06:56:45] <mauriyouth> function
[06:57:07] <mauriyouth> ?
[06:58:22] <fengjie> "function() { return f; }      new f() instance ;" return true or false?
[06:59:09] <juxta> mauriyouth: can you clarify what you meant by passing a reference to this? I've tried, but I'm not sure if I am doing it correctly.
[06:59:57] <mauriyouth> var that = this; // do it before setting ur callback
[07:00:17] <mauriyouth> and pass "that" to ur callback
[07:00:20] <mg983> Hi all, I am trying to select the last tab (there will be a variable irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/#Â of tabs) with jqueryui â€” Googling tells me to use Â var tabs = $( "#rounds" ).tabs({ selected: âˆ’1 }); Â but this doesn't work â€” anyone have any insight?
[07:00:41] <mauriyouth> ajax(...., function() {})
[07:00:50] <juxta> mauriyouth: hmm. that's what I did, I think: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=s6zHuNNh
[07:00:56] <mauriyouth> that.urmethod()
[07:01:04] <fengjie> "function f(){ return f; };         new f() instanceof f;" sorry for that, type mistake.
[07:01:33] <fengjie> It says the result is true, but I want to know why.
[07:01:38] <mauriyouth> no need to pass that
[07:01:45] <mauriyouth> use it immediately
[07:01:52] <juxta> mauriyouth: oh, right.
[07:01:56] <juxta> I'll try
[07:02:01] <mauriyouth> and don't forget var that
[07:02:08] <mauriyouth> var that =this;
[07:02:13] <mauriyouth> not that = this
[07:02:46] <juxta> mauriyouth: okay, perfect - that worked, thanks! var that = this means it's only within the scope of the object, right?
[07:02:53] <shoky> mg983: read the API docs.. $('#rounds').tabs('option', 'active', -1)

[07:04:05] <mg983> shoky, yeah so that doesn't work
[07:04:24] <shoky> mg983 then make a jsfiddle
[07:04:39] <woozly> I mean: how to determine, that URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coding_Shots_Annual_Plan_high_res-5.jpg - isn't direct to file, and url: https://www.google.ru/images/srpr/logo4w.png is direct-file url

[07:20:21] <RVPolonsky> who knows, why there is no data-transition "slideleft" and "slideright"? Just "slide" which slides from the right to the left. But what if I need to slide my page from the left to the right?
[07:21:02] <enoch> how to disable a single date (ui datepicker) when clicking it?

[07:21:36] <PapaSierra> are there any conditions under which a form would not submit by pressing enter in a plain old <input type=text> ? i've removed all my preventDefault(), but there is one form that simply will not post. it begins its life hidden in a tab. a form in another tab works just fine.
[07:21:38] <b-ot> PapaSierra: No output.
[07:21:46] <tubbo> lolwut...apparently this is the culprit: $(document).on 'ajaxStart', 'body', -> $(this).addClass "loading"
[07:22:02] <tubbo> it seems to only like it when i bind the event like $('body').on 'ajaxStart', -> $(this).addClass "loading"
[07:22:12] <tubbo> in my fiddle, however, this works flawlessly

[08:38:44] <john-dev_> hey, i am looking for a way to animate a 5000x5000px background image along a path, http://www.artofflightmovie.com/ is animating their background
[08:38:55] <john-dev_> like*
[08:39:18] <john-dev_> any ideas?
[08:47:54] <andrewo> I am submitting a form with Ajax where data[Project][project_name] is being posted.  In success: function(data) I need to get the project name.  How can I get that?
[08:48:03] <djQuery> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=857820
[08:48:26] <andrewo> I want to prepend it to an unordered list
[08:48:27] <djQuery> what the heck is my site going to do for bling without the blink tag
[08:49:38] <eightfold> i want to do: if a <p> has an <img> inside it (the <img> will sometimes be surrounded by an <a>), remove margin-bottom from <p>.
[08:49:39] <eightfold> shouldn't $('.postcontent p:has(img)').css("margin-bottom","0");
[08:50:11] <djQuery> andrewo, success: function(data){      $('<li>', {text: data.project_name}).appendTo('ul.selector);}
[08:50:35] <eightfold> work?
[08:50:36] <djQuery> might wanna test to see if data.project_name is there first
[08:50:54] <andrewo> I tried doing a console.log on data.project_name and it's undefined.
[08:51:32] <djQuery> andrewo, then try console.log(data) and see where it is in data
[08:51:48] <andrewo> It's just a ton of HTML
[08:52:27] <djQuery> andrewo, hmmm then $(data).find('#project_name').text()?????
[08:52:42] <andrewo> I'll give that a shot
[08:53:39] <djQuery> andrewo, would be better if the server would respond with a json object
[08:54:49] <andrewo> To do that do I need to add dataType: json?
[08:55:29] <andrewo> The .find returns an empty string
[08:57:16] <eightfold> i want to apply the margin-bottom: 0 to the p. what does this affect: $('.postcontent p a').has('img').css("margin-bottom","0");
[08:57:17] <eightfold> ?
[08:57:50] <shoky> the <a>
[09:00:53] <eightfold> shoky: ok, thanks. i want to affect the <p> and add 0 border bottom if there's an image inside it
[09:00:59] <eightfold> better: $('.postcontent p').has('img').css("margin-bottom","0");
[09:00:59] <eightfold> ?
[09:01:31] <eightfold> (the <img> can be inside an <a> sometimes)
[09:01:56] <shoky> that should work, i think
[09:02:16] <shoky> if it doesn't, make a jsfiddle
[09:03:53] <eightfold> shoky: i wonder if it is not valid code, because when i add it all other jquery code within <script> in <head> stops working. code looks like this: http://pastebin.com/gE4axCEK
[09:04:30] <Niels___> I have 4 select lists generated dynamically with ajax, when a user clicks back after submitting the form it selects gets funky, how do I reset every single select when a user clicks back? any suggestions?
[09:04:46] <shoky> eightfold: check your syntax.. you have an extra });
[09:06:03] <djQuery> andrewo, I don't know what your back end is you will need to give it a try and see
[09:06:15] <eightfold> shoky: line 7 and 10 should be removed?
[09:06:31] <shoky> eightfold: just 10
[09:06:52] <shoky> eightfold: indent your code properly and you'll see it easily
[09:08:38] <eightfold> shoky: thank you for your help
[09:08:41] <eightfold> shoky: works now
[09:10:26] <djQuery> eightfold, or get an editor that allows for lint
[09:10:31] <djQuery> ?g jslint
[09:10:32] <b-ot> djQuery: JSLint,The JavaScript Code Quality Tool â†’ http://www.jslint.com/
[09:10:33] <bot-t> djQuery, JSLint,The JavaScript Code Quality Tool - http://www.jslint.com/
[09:14:22] <eightfold> shoky: thanks. any non-web editors that does this? sublime text?
[09:14:55] <djQuery> eightfold, yes there is a lint plugin for sublime
[09:15:26] <murr4y> hi all, what's the best way to check if a js array of strings contains a certain string?
[09:15:30] <djQuery> https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter
[09:17:40] <shoky> murr4y: indexOf
[09:18:31] <mehwork> i have an jquery array that's actually an object (Object[1,2,3]), and so it gives TypeError if i try to use an array method on it. How can i convert it to a real array?
[09:18:49] <Snwspeckle> Stephen-B: Im back
[09:18:50] <djQuery> $([
[09:18:56] <shoky> mehwork: .get()
[09:18:59] <murr4y> shoky: thanks!
[09:19:52] <mehwork> shoky: thanks
[09:20:14] <djQuery> $(['asdf', 'sadflkj;ldfsa', 'asfj;l4', 'zebra']).each(function(){   if (this.indexOf('zebra') ===0){ do something here}})
[09:21:21] <djQuery> mehwork, ^^^^
[09:23:35] <Niels___> when a user clicks back after submitting a form I want to reset all selects, I have done it like so: http://pastebin.com/c3vy0gkj and it works perfectly, but it doesn't feel right. Any better suggestions?
[09:24:56] <shoky> Niels___ you can do $('select').prop('selectedIndex', 0)
[09:25:22] <shoky> (which would do the same thing)
[09:25:27] <djQuery> Niels___, $('select>option').prop('selected', false)
[09:25:30] <Niels___> shoky: excellent, thanks :)
[09:25:57] <djQuery> Niels___, incase there are multi selects
[09:26:10] <Niels___> djQuery: there are multiple selects, but that one doesn't work
[09:30:36] <Snwspeckle> Has anyone here used bootstrap
[09:30:57] <ladislaw> #twitter-bootstrap
[09:31:07] <Snwspeckle> No one ever responds there
[09:31:19] <ladislaw> just did
[09:31:21] <Snwspeckle> Its a query question anyway
[09:31:24] <ladislaw> oh
[09:31:42] <Snwspeckle> I need to reload my modal because when the page loads the modal data is already set
[09:32:15] <djQuery> Niels___, seems to work here http://jsbin.com/agobih/1/edit
[09:32:25] <djQuery> Niels___, check out the console.
[09:33:23] <djQuery> Snwspeckle, well next time just ask see ?ask
[09:33:23] <bot-t> Snwspeckle, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:33:33] <Niels___> djQuery: hmm, weird
[09:34:55] <Snwspeckle> When a user clicks the edit button in my table, I want a modal to open with the users data to be edited. The problem is that the modal is being set when the page first loads so the users data is not set in the modal when the user clicks edit. How can I refresh the modal when the user clicks edit to have the modal load the data of the user selected?
[09:34:59] <djQuery> Niels___, also if you have a lot of unselected options you might want $('option')is(':selected').prop('selected', false)
[09:35:43] <Niels___> djQuery: all i really want to do is just to reset every single select list on the page whenever a user clicks back
[09:36:42] <pennismen> t_p
[09:36:46] <pennismen> sorry
[09:37:21] <pennismen> the problem is that var id
[09:37:26] <pennismen> get UNDEFINED
[09:38:07] <djQuery> Snwspeckle, $('.btnEdit').click(function(){   var $t = $(this), rowID = $t.closest('tr').data('rowID');   $.ajax({ go get the row data, success: function(data){ populate some form with the data; $('whateverform').modal();}});});
[09:38:34] <djQuery> pennismen, is it still in scope?
[09:38:43] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/dSABk/
[09:38:47] <daslicht> whay is thi not working ?
[09:39:09] <daslicht> cant you fadeIn an element wich was hidden with hide() ?
[09:39:32] <pennismen> djQueryno understand you
[09:39:58] <shoky> daslicht:  you're doing fadeIn on #mylist
[09:40:07] <shoky> daslicht: but that's not what's hidden
[09:40:14] <Snwspeckle> djQuery: Currently what I do is get the row ID with data-userID and I set it to a local variable. What I do next is perform a _GET request to a PHP class which sets the selected userID into a session variable. I then launch the editModal which contains a form of all the user fields that can be edited.
[09:40:35] <Snwspeckle> The problem is that the form is empty because I never refreshed the modal to load with the userID
[09:40:45] <djQuery> daslicht, http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/dSABk/2/
[09:40:47] <Snwspeckle> aka, the PHP query with the userID never occurred because it wasn
[09:40:50] <Snwspeckle> wasn't set yet*
[09:41:14] <djQuery> Snwspeckle, then in the click of the edit you need to populate it before showing it
[09:41:42] <pennismen> djQuery my problem is that i write in INPUT, for example do $(selector).keyup write in input and put ALERT and do it very well
[09:41:46] <Snwspeckle> So how can I refresh the modals before they are presented?
[09:41:50] <pennismen> but using a variable no send me value
[09:41:56] <pennismen> i don't know what i am doing bad
[09:42:10] <tubbo> jQuery.migrate is still giving me warnings when i have this code in my project: https://gist.github.com/5347282
[09:42:14] <pennismen> want get value from API
[09:42:19] <tubbo> the problem is, i'm not sure what i'm supposed to change this to.
[09:42:48] <tubbo> it makes sense to attach ajax events to the $('body'), but $(document) is supposedly the preferred obj to work with...and when i try to attach events to the document itself, nothing works
[09:42:49] <daslicht> djQuery : thanks!
[09:42:54] <tubbo> like the events don't get bound
[09:43:14] <Snwspeckle> djQuery: My modals are inside the file sidebar.tpl.php
[09:43:47] <Snwspeckle> I require_once the file before my table on the page where you select a user in the table
[09:44:01] <daslicht> djQuery: any idea why my approch was not working ?
[09:44:09] <daslicht> approach
[09:44:33] <djQuery> daslicht, like shoky said you were fading in  the wrong item
[09:45:01] <tubbo> like what am i doing wrong here?
[09:45:11] <daslicht> ahh ok
[09:45:30] <daslicht> shoky : thanks , i missed you reply in teh list
[09:46:05] <pennismen> anyone?
[09:47:00] <djQuery> pennismen, looks good to me however I have allways used $.ajaxSetup for this instead
[09:47:40] <pennismen> yes but my problem is that no read well variable ID
[09:47:44] <pennismen> no understand why
[09:48:01] <djQuery> opps wrong person
[09:48:10] <pennismen> jaajja
[09:48:11] <pennismen> okz
[09:48:21] <djQuery> tubbo, I have allways used jQuery.ajaxSetup for this kinda thing
[09:48:26] <pennismen> mealwhile i write should get VAL and put in variable
[09:48:29] <shoky> tubbo: what warning? and i'm not sure what you're trying to do there.. what's $(this)
[09:49:18] <pennismen> http://80.34.103.186/app.php/clients/alf/autocomplete
[09:49:20] <pennismen> where is ALF
[09:49:33] <djQuery> If $.ajax() or $.ajaxSetup() is called with the global option set to false, the .ajaxStart() method will not fire.
[09:49:33] <pennismen> is my variable.. need pass this variable there for get by browser
[09:51:39] <codephobic> hi
[09:51:58] <codephobic> Could someone recommend a good online tutorial for object oriented jquery which covers connecting to and handling results from a database via ajax/json?
[09:52:14] <codephobic> I'm just looking to make sense of how this would be done... at the moment I'm using a regular jQuery ajax object and handling the data within the "success" method... but I'm curious to know how it might be integrated into a custom object (say an object type for employees that would pull in the person's details from a database query and format a table with the results)
[09:53:16] <Gho5t> isn't it just creating an object and putting some CRUD methods on it and using $.ajax within those
[09:54:05] <tubbo> haha :D
[09:54:29] <daslicht> not quite jquery, but, anyone know how to get rid of the scrollbar track of this select : http://imgur.com/EiawjCZ
[09:54:47] <daslicht> the right space where the scrollbar would be
[09:54:48] <tubbo> djQuery / shoky: turns out it was a bad live() call in another part of the project...fixed it, everything works.
[09:55:21] <tubbo> the reason i got tripped up was because it was still firing the "loading screen" so i thought all ajax was still working, but it turns out it was screwing up when it came time to render the response
[09:55:32] <codephobic> Gho5t, was that a response to my question?
[09:56:02] <Gho5t> yes
[09:56:29] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/dAdhh/
[09:56:31] <daslicht> :)
[09:57:27] <bil> So it's my understanding in an $.each loop one can use return to break out of it. However my code keeps looping even after hitting return https://gist.github.com/bspingarn/330c9a7884286077fc6c
[09:58:00] <codephobic> Gho5t, k. Well what I'm trying to grasp is whether you can create regular objects and use methods to grab data through ajax and set properties for the objects. And hopefully a tutorial which demonstrates this in practice.
[09:58:38] <Gho5t> codephobic: if you're familiar with creating objects in js, it's rather trivial
[09:59:12] <codephobic> Gho5t, I'm not that familiar and I'm just having trouble grasping how it fits together ...
[10:00:02] <codephobic> Gho5t, for instance, if I create an object called employee, and I want to populate name, id etc through ajax, how would I structure it?
[10:00:03] <shoky> bil: you need to return false
[10:00:09] <bil> never mind, i need to return false
[10:00:11] <bil> yeah
[10:00:14] <bil> :)
[10:00:27] <bil> thanks shaky and stack overflow
[10:00:29] <bil> hehe
[10:01:03] <codephobic> Gho5t, there will be many employees I create from the employee object, so each one is going to call ajax and get back data.. no?
[10:03:15] <Gho5t> so iterate over the returned data and create a new employee using a constructor function
[10:03:25] <Gho5t> sorry I know you need more
[10:03:30] <Gho5t> but I'm on a call
[10:05:01] <codephobic> k, thanks anyway Gho5t

[10:08:15] <john-dev_> hey, i am looking for a way to animate a 5000x5000px background image along a path, like http://www.artofflightmovie.com/ is animating their background, any ideas?
[10:08:57] <eddiemonge> masentinel900: do what?

[10:12:51] <john-dev_> eddiemonge: well i read all those articles, as you can see i even got it working on http://v2.wepixel.de/files/wepixelv2/sp/ but the performance is crap
[10:13:04] <john-dev_> (the bg is stolen for testing purposes only)
[10:13:06] <Snwspeckle> Can someone write me something that would AJAX reload a bootstrap modal when I click a button please? I am so lost its not even funny anymore
[10:13:25] <eddiemonge> john-dev_: looks fine to me
[10:13:42] <john-dev_> click on a number on the bottom elft site
[10:13:54] <eddiemonge> Snwspeckle: not this again.
[10:14:07] <Snwspeckle> eddiemonge: Haha i'm so close to fixing this stupid issue
[10:14:09] <eddiemonge> john-dev_: yup seems fine to me
[10:14:24] <john-dev_> damn.. my firefox has some problems, chrome looks fine, your are right
[10:14:26] <Snwspeckle> I just need a way to refresh my modal before I show it
[10:15:04] <djQuery> codephobic, have you looked at any of the templating engines backbone or knockout.js for example
[10:15:11] <john-dev_> eddiemonge: what browser do you use?
[10:15:27] <john-dev_> and which os
[10:15:44] <eddiemonge> john-dev_: mac chrome
[10:16:06] <eddiemonge> Snwspeckle: no, you need to have the data come from your ajax request that you then populate into the modal
[10:16:13] <john-dev_> eddiemonge: could you try mac firefox?
[10:16:19] <john-dev_> safair seems to work fine too
[10:16:26] <Snwspeckle> All I need to do is refresh the modal code with AJAX, not get data with it
[10:17:15] <eddiemonge> Snwspeckle: i think you are missing the point of ajax. why make two requests when one will do?
[10:17:52] <eddiemonge> john-dev_: ok so FF doesnt like it
[10:18:04] <Snwspeckle> Ive concluded the problem is that the modal is set when I load the table page before I click any buttons. At that point the modal is empty and is not populated with anything because no ID was set to perform a query
[10:18:14] <Snwspeckle> Once I set the ID, I want to refresh that modal to perform the query
[10:18:22] <john-dev_> eddiemonge: ok, wondering how to debug this.. ill try some things, thanks so far!
[10:18:24] <Snwspeckle> That's how I will get the data
[10:22:38] <codephobic> djQuery, sorry was afk... I've not used any templating engines. I just wanted to understand how such things are done. I'm relatively new to javascript and OOP, but I figured that there must be tutorials on this matter.
[10:37:23] <b-lew> http://bvh.delineamultimedia.com/?page_id=2 -> on this page I have a position absolute bottom 0 on the footer areaâ€¦ on the iphone when you scroll up it displays the content then snaps to the proper spotâ€¦ is there a way to avoid this?

[10:47:57] <sting32> there we go.. no one is in prototype.. everyone is here..
[10:48:14] <sting32> i need to make the switch soon. Everytime i write another line of prototype code I think to myself i should be using jquery
[10:48:42] <sting32> but the boss has yet to approve it so on i go.. trying to keep my prototype to ajax requests and dom selections.. should be easy enough to translate when the time comes?

[11:08:12] <eddiemonge> john-dev_:  no idea. didnt look too closely
[11:08:24] <john-dev_> would you mind?
[11:08:30] <john-dev_> masentinel900: you didnt load jquery
[11:08:47] <eddiemonge> masentinel900: you didnt specify want you wanted done
[11:08:58] <masentinel900> Is that this a function apart from the mainly html
[11:09:03] <masentinel900> Ok

[11:10:31] <eddiemonge> say what? so you want css done?

[11:12:11] <limpc> is there a way to format json in a textarea?
[11:12:29] <eddiemonge> limpc: why would you want to? to display it nicely for the user?
[11:12:33] <limpc> yes
[11:12:37] <pachet> use <pre>
[11:12:45] <limpc> its for api representation
[11:12:52] <limpc> pachet: its in a textarea.
[11:13:04] <eddiemonge> limpc: then put it in a <pre> and not a textarea
[11:13:09] <pachet> lol
[11:13:11] <insign> Hi, is possible get all elements, except the first? Existe a select for this?
[11:13:16] <limpc> eddiemonge: they need to be able to edit the json contents
[11:13:42] <limpc> we provide a json-based api for end users. this is a sandbox for them to test api calls.
[11:13:52] <eddiemonge> insign: http://api.jquery.com/gt-selector/
[11:13:54] <nc90> guys i'd like to use each() instead of a "for"... who can help me? thanks in advance http://jsfiddle.net/JJJhX/
[11:13:58] <pachet> limpc: then use a tried and true code editor
[11:13:59] <pachet> eg ace
[11:14:14] <eddiemonge> limpc: then formatting doesnt matter
[11:14:20] <eddiemonge> nc90: why?
[11:14:23] <insign> eddiemonge, thank you
[11:14:57] <limpc> eddiemonge: it does, some of the calls contain alot of variables, which makes it almost unreadable in a textarea. I'd like to get it formatted with \t's and the like so its easy to read.
[11:14:59] <nc90> eddiemonge: because i need to do the same things, but i can't use "#element_" + i....
[11:15:00] <mehwork> with .css() how do you assign multiple values to a single attribute?
[11:15:20] <mehwork> e.g., if it needs -moz and -webkit to a single attribute
[11:15:39] <eddiemonge> limpc: good luck with your regex then
[11:15:49] <eddiemonge> nc90: yes you can. and for is far faster
[11:16:00] <limpc> .. nm. ill just follow pachet suggestion and use something like codemirror.
[11:16:02] <eddiemonge> mehwork: use 1.9.x and up
[11:17:19] <mehwork> eddiemonge: but what would the syntax be
[11:18:03] <nc90> eddiemonge: no, i can't :) this fiddle was just an example found online http://jsfiddle.net/JJJhX/ ... but i have to edit it to accomplish my specs... please can you help me? i just want to use $('container').each( ... )
[11:19:22] <eddiemonge> mehwork: have you tried it?
[11:20:05] <mehwork> eddiemonge: yes, every which way i could think
[11:20:17] <mehwork> separating by ;'s separating by ,'s, not separating at all
[11:20:35] <mehwork> and you can't use two background keys or you get duplicate key errors
[11:20:48] <eddiemonge> mehwork: i meant just try normal css and then see if it automagically applies prefixes
[11:20:50] <mehwork> the only thing that seems to work is multiple calls .css() which is what i'm trying to avoid
[11:21:19] <mehwork> eddiemonge: well that's what i meant by separating ;'s
[11:21:28] <masentinel900> http://i.imgur.com/g1xVMq0.jpg
[11:21:38] <masentinel900> eddiemonge: See that plz
[11:21:55] <masentinel900> I dont need that show me :: ["moon","sun","sky"]
[11:22:16] <mehwork> eddiemonge: psuedocode example: $(bla).css('elem', '-moz: foo(); -webkit: foo()');
[11:22:21] <eddiemonge> mehwork: i meant .css('border-radius', '10px') not the best example but just try non-prefixed and see what happens
[11:22:43] <masentinel900> I need them one pre line
[11:23:10] <eddiemonge> mehwork: and thats not how you do it anyway. $(bla).css({prop: val, prop2: val2});
[11:23:24] <eddiemonge> masentinel900: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for
[11:23:29] <mehwork> eddiemonge: i know but i'm trying to assign val and val2 to the SAME prop
[11:23:48] <eddiemonge> mehwork: again, just try it non-prefixed
[11:24:32] <mehwork> eddiemonge: how would non prefixed have any idea what i'm doing in this context when the code to do a gradient is completely different for mozilla than it is for chrome
[11:25:10] <eddiemonge> ok then $(bla).css({prop: val, prop2: val});
[11:25:29] <mehwork> eddiemonge: you're not getting it. I said both vals need to apply to the same property
[11:25:29] <eddiemonge> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.cssHooks/
[11:25:40] <mehwork> i know how to do it for multiple properties
[11:26:15] <mehwork> i need to do this without getting a duplicate key error: $(bla).css({prop: val, prop: val});
[11:28:05] <eddiemonge> mehwork: then maybe you should just use a class and add/remove that
[11:30:04] <mehwork> not a bad idea, but was hoping this would work
[11:31:16] <nc90> eddiemonge: why this code is wrong? please see line 2... https://gist.github.com/anonymous/164b820c2c1aa686a20c
[11:31:49] <eddiemonge> because this is a object and not a string
[11:31:59] <eddiemonge> console.log( this )
[11:32:28] <pennismen> what is here bad: if see in CONSOLE variable searchValue is undefined
[11:32:29] <pennismen> :(
[11:32:34] <pennismen> all fucking day for solve this
[11:32:43] <nc90> eddiemonge: thanks, how can i solve this?
[11:32:55] <g0rd0n> i am struggling to upgrade from jqueryui 1.9 to 1.10 because of tabs... before I had window.location.hash = ui.tab.hash; in the select event which is now gone... i have not been able to access the hash of the selected tab in beforeActivate... i always get undefined!
[11:32:59] <g0rd0n> how can i get that to work?
[11:33:31] <eddiemonge> pennismen: it means your variable searchValue is undefined
[11:33:43] <pennismen> yes but i can't find solution
[11:33:46] <pennismen> or where is fail
[11:33:55] <eddiemonge> nc90: .find()
[11:34:02] <pennismen> i want write in INPUT and the value get for variable
[11:34:04] <pennismen> :(
[11:34:27] <eddiemonge> pennismen: look in your code where it says the error is
[11:34:36] <nc90> eddiemonge: thanks.. now i'll look for .find() in the docs
[11:34:42] <pennismen> no say error only show me UNDEFINED
[11:34:50] <pennismen> GET http://80.34.103.186/clients/undefined/autocomplete?callback=jQuery183034268593275919557_1365532333081&_=1365532348518 404 (Not Found)
[11:34:54] <eddiemonge> pennismen: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[11:35:31] <eddiemonge> pennismen: still looks undefined. you need to figure out where that variable is set and determine why its not getting set
[11:35:46] <eddiemonge> g0rd0n: what do you mean?
[11:35:54] <pennismen> i don't know do this
[11:35:56] <pennismen> where could read?
[11:36:19] <eddiemonge> pennismen: do you know javascript or jquery?
[11:36:37] <pennismen> jquery i am more familiar
[11:36:41] <g0rd0n> eddiemonge: when i click on a tab, i want the hash in the browser url bar to update with the actual tab title... so one can easily copy the link and when opening it it would open the right tab... it worked like a charm unti. 1.9, but 1.10 seems impossibible to do
[11:36:58] <pennismen> i can't understand why no work
[11:37:31] <pachet> your name is very
[11:37:34] <pachet> evocative, we'll say
[11:38:24] <eddiemonge> g0rd0n: so you want by hash instead of tab order?
[11:38:46] <eddiemonge> pennismen: read that site i sent you. learn some javascript basics and then the answer will come easily
[11:39:05] <Tulip> Hi, Do anyone know why javascript split(/\n/) function doesn't show the same result in below IE8 as it shows with other browsers and versions
[11:39:41] <eddiemonge> Tulip: because ie doesnt work?
[11:40:23] <eddiemonge> Tulip: are you comparing other browsers on windows as well or just IE?
[11:40:41] <g0rd0n> eddiemonge: i got it to work, sort of, by doing window.location.hash = ui.newPanel.attr('id'); however the id is just ui-tabs-1, ui-tabs-2 etc... in previous jqueryui i would have the name i put in the title attribute in the <li> link
[11:40:41] <Tulip> eddiemonge: You mean to say that IE8 doesn't support split function?
[11:41:22] <Tulip> eddiemonge: it is creating issue only with IE and want solve that
[11:41:33] <eddiemonge> Tulip: no im saying you arent really showing any code
[11:41:54] <nc90> eddiemonge: mmh... it doesn't work... what's wrong now? http://jsfiddle.net/qCNGG/
[11:42:22] <shoky> g0rd0n: if you want the title of the link you can get it with ui.newTab.attr('title')
[11:43:45] <eddiemonge> nc90: http://jsfiddle.net/qCNGG/1/ and you have a typo ill let you find
[11:45:03] <eddiemonge> Tulip: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1155678/javascript-string-newline-character

[11:45:34] <nc90> eddiemonge: thanks :)
[11:45:58] <blindMoe> is it possible to get the index of a child element that contains a certain class?  for example: if a list has 4 list items and the 3rd one has the class 'foobar' I want to return 2 ( 0 based index )
[11:46:06] <g0rd0n> eddiemonge: i got it working, now i just need the correct tab to be selected based on the hash in the url...
[11:46:21] <blindMoe> actually.. I shouldn't say "is it possible" but instead say "is there a function that does this for me"  :)

[11:47:18] <blindMoe> eddiemonge: danka
[11:49:25] <Onkeltem> Hi
[11:49:54] <Tulip> eddiemonge: eddiemonge: I am using flexsllider and have customized it to show the captions like here http://www.computereverything.net/staging/, if you open this in firefox it alerts captions, I have splitted using this code var caption_values = jQuery(".flex-caption").text().split(/\n/); it works fine with other browsers but making some issues with IE8. the way it alerts result in IE8 is different I to want solve
[11:49:59] <TheSisb> ChanServ sets mode: +o TheSisb
[11:50:23] <Onkeltem> jQuery UI 1.8.x there was a file like `jquery.effects.core`. How it's called now in 1.10.2?
[11:50:34] <Onkeltem> jquery.ui.effect?
[11:51:13] <eddiemonge> TheSisb: doesnt seem to work in chrome. and alerts, eww
[11:51:36] <kickandrew> Onkeltem: I think it's jquery.ui.effect.js
[11:51:40] <kickandrew> not sure tho
[11:52:07] <TheSisb> eddiemonge: ?
[11:52:10] <eddiemonge> Tulip : doesnt seem to work in chrome. and alerts, eww
[11:52:11] <Onkeltem> kickandrew: I've come to the save conclusion
[11:52:16] <TheSisb> ah
[11:52:17] <Onkeltem> same*
[11:52:27] <eddiemonge> only one person per letter can speak at a time
[11:52:59] <TheSisb> shotgun T
[11:53:21] <eddiemonge> Onkeltem: does it matter for something?
[11:54:36] <Onkeltem> eddiemonge: yeah, Drupal's jQuery Update module has a bug. Now fixed
[11:54:39] <eddiemonge> Tulip: you need some script concat and clean up wow
[11:56:16] <eddiemonge> Onkeltem: is that for the front end templates and stuff or what?
[11:58:24] <Onkeltem> eddiemonge: jQuery is fully built into into Drupal administration stuff
[11:58:54] <Onkeltem> not fully, don't know correct word. I mean w/o jQuery correctly functioning you won't get much from Drupal
[11:59:49] <eddiemonge> drupal is funny
[12:01:33] <Tulip> eddiemonge: http://pastebin.com/dh4WsK2B here is my code find "Code Need to be Edited" this in the code
[12:01:38] <blindMoe> anyone here worked with anything slider much?  I am having a problem where no matter which direction the slider is slid ( using the arrow nav ) the 'activePage' property is always incremented by 1 and never goes back by one when the user clicks the back arrow
[12:02:23] <Tulip> eddiemonge: that is my code for displaying caption with url under thumbnail image
[12:03:02] <eddiemonge> Tulip: umm. thats a lot of code. cant you simplify it?
[12:05:40] <Tulip> eddiemonge: http://pastebin.com/ENnBYcri
[12:07:10] <eddiemonge> Tulip: why do those matter anyway? is it just for the alert box? those don't display in html anyway unless they are in a <pre> block
[12:15:05] <Tulip_> eddiemonge: I dont want to just alert them I want display the captions in html .flex-caption here please check this in chrome or firefox and in IE8. You will see the difference that the way it results
[12:16:32] <Tulip_> eddiemonge: Please check this you will get to see alert of captions http://www.computereverything.net/staging/
[12:17:26] <eddiemonge> like i said, is it only going in alerts?
[12:17:34] <wachpwnski> If you have a series of ajax calls, how do you execute code after they have all have finished (completed or failed) ?
[12:17:51] <blindMoe> I can't seem to get .index() to do what I need.. if I have a div with the class 'slider' and multiple children of which one contains the class 'activePage' .. I figured I could do $('div.slider').children().index('div.activePage'); or just $('div.activePage').index() but neither are returning the proper index... can someone set me straight with using .index() ?
[12:18:47] <Tulip_> eddiemonge: I am generating them in alert for time being to see the exact output
[12:19:08] <blindMoe> Tulip_: why not use console.log() ?
[12:20:10] <zeromodulus> looks like while (true) {animate_stuff()} was a bad idea.
[12:20:10] <eddiemonge> Tulip_: again, if they arent going in an alert then  \n dont matter as they dont display in the outputted HTML. if you are merely using them to break up strings into an array then there are far better ways to do it
[12:20:22] <eddiemonge> wachpwnski: promises
[12:21:05] <Tulip_> eddiemonge: ok Can you tell any of them that would work in all browsers specially with IE
[12:21:16] <wachpwnski> eddiemonge: so like $.when( ajax1, ajax2 ).done( )  sort of thing?
[12:23:18] <nesoi> if I want to create an .on for some element, does it matter what event I do it in? If I do it in the wrong place, will I be creating multiple triggers for the same event?
[12:23:40] <Tulip_> eddiemonge: But I can see them in html http://screencast.com/t/uscVuOQt2hA please check
[12:25:05] <nesoi> in other words, if I have something like:
[12:25:19] <nesoi> $( document ).on("pageinit", "#message-page", function() {
[12:25:19] <nesoi> $('#recipientsList').on('tap', '.ui-btn', function(e){
[12:25:41] <eddiemonge> wachpwnski: sure
[12:25:42] <nesoi> will jquery even create more than one trigger on the tap?
[12:26:24] <eddiemonge> Tulip_: i dont see any there. if you just want to get rid of spaces, $.trim()
[12:26:54] <nesoi> ever
[12:26:56] <nesoi> I mean
[12:28:09] <Tulip_> No its just showing up "Undefined" in IE on other browsers its showing captions as I want them to, How would I solve "Undefined"
[12:28:41] <nesoi> no one knows or it's just a dumb question?
[12:29:09] <eddiemonge> nesoi: i think you are not entirely understanding how event handlers work
[12:29:16] <eddiemonge> might want to go read up on them again
[12:29:40] <pachet> hint: not just how jquery does event handling
[12:29:42] <eddiemonge> Tulip_: do it differently. again get over the \n. use actual json and use that to create your ajax requests
[12:31:38] <nesoi> eddiemonge: I'm trying to figure out what is causing things to be slow, and what is causing events to go where I don't want them.
[12:32:08] <nesoi> In one case I have a popup and clicking a button on the popup will select a textarea if the button is over the textarea
[12:32:17] <nesoi> do you or does anyone here know how to make that not happen?
[12:35:19] <mehwork> is there a way using jquery to get the value of a css property? e.g., get  4 out of .bla { foo: bar; age: 4 } ?
[12:35:53] <mehwork> $('.bla').val('age') or something
[12:41:54] <mehwork> nm i got it
[12:42:58] <tucan> $("#alphabet a").click(function() { var id = this.href.hash; var sections = $("sectionSelector").hide();  $("#" + id).show();  });
[12:43:19] <tucan> could someone explain what the hashtag is doing there?
[12:44:58] <pachet> it's not a hashtag, child of the twitterlineum
[12:45:09] <pachet> back when phones were a thing, # was called a pound sign
[12:45:24] <pachet> in css land, it designates that you're selecting an element by its id
[12:45:35] <culh> # that ass
[12:45:36] <pachet> so #foo would return an element in the dom with the id attribute of 'foo'
[12:46:01] <hpekdemi1> how can I change the width of the bootstrap element .dropdown-menu?
[12:46:07] <hpekdemi1> in nav collapse
[12:48:01] <eddiemonge> ugh sometimes i hate twitter bootstrap
[12:48:13] <eddiemonge> and by sometimes i mean most of the time. so much hate for something i dont even use
[12:49:57] <nesoi> is anyone here good with events?
[12:50:12] <nesoi> No one seems to have a solution for this one: I have a popup and clicking a button on the popup will select a textarea if the button is over the textarea
[12:53:43] <tucan> thanks
[12:54:11] <apucacao> i am writing a small plugin for a simple menu system. when clicking a menu I want to close any other open menu. whenever the plugin is invoked $.fn.menu, i keep a cache of the affected elements in an array. is there a way to turn that array into a jQuery object so that I can easily call functions on it?
[12:58:00] <apucacao> ah, i can just pass the array to $
[12:58:16] <john_k> hello.. does anybody knows why im getting multiple instances of a dialog when i click the link http://jsfiddle.net/6qgTr/
[12:59:32] <zeromodulus> how can I make a div overlap a subsequent div?
[13:00:14] <sacho> relative or absolute positioning
[13:00:15] <zeromodulus> er, well
[13:00:18] <zeromodulus> not subsequent, but
[13:00:29] <zeromodulus> the div that comes after it, the sequent div. :p
[13:00:47] <codepython777> is there a widget that allows a user to upload an image on my webpage from disk or url?
[13:01:05] <zeromodulus> both of these divs are in a container
[13:01:13] <zeromodulus> so, relative or absolute on the container?
[13:05:05] <sacho> zeromodulus, relative on one of the divs
[13:08:00] <eddiemonge> codepython777: yeah, input type="file"
[13:17:31] <djQuery> when writing a plugin is it possible to get the css selectore that the plugin is acting on like   $('.whateverclass').myPlugin();   get the .whateverclass?
[13:18:28] <djQuery> and what if they did $('.something').find('.whatever').myPlugin()    will it be result in   '.something .whatever' ?
[13:20:41] <sacho> why do you need this?
[13:30:44] <nerdFight> anyone have suggestions pop-up hovers for piecharts?
[13:31:03] <nerdFight> seems hard to find for circle or weird shapes
[13:31:42] <nerdFight> I can make a pop-up bubble no prob, its when you get into single images and circles that it gets strange
[13:32:39] <wachpwnski> nerdFight: why not use something like d3 charts or something?
[13:32:55] <maria> ciao
[13:33:18] <ravenzz> ciao
[13:35:16] <shesek> !xy
[13:36:15] <djQuery> sacho, I need to add css that will only apply to elements that are add in the future
[13:36:58] <ravenzz> djQuery how?
[13:37:17] <ravenzz> the css will be applied to the old ones too
[13:37:23] <ravenzz> djQuery anyway http://jsfiddle.net/TyqtD/ but I am not sure how safe it is
[13:37:38] <djQuery> ravenzz, style = document.createElement('style');
[13:38:10] <eddiemonge> djQuery: use a class and add that class to the new elements
[13:38:34] <djQuery> style=innerHTML = selector ' newstuff';
[13:39:01] <djQuery> eddiemonge, was hopping not to have to add a css file to my plugin
[13:39:14] <djQuery> style=innerHTML = selector + ' newstuff';
[13:39:16] <ravenzz> why?
[13:39:26] <djQuery> why not?
[13:39:31] <ravenzz> what eddiemonge said makes more sense
[13:39:51] <ravenzz> I am not sure that the selector property is the actual CSS selector
[13:39:58] <ravenzz> all the times
[13:40:17] <ravenzz> sometime is a jQuery representation of it
[13:40:21] <ravenzz> iirc
[13:48:54] <nc90> how can i get the $('#obj').offset().bottom ?
[13:49:12] <eddiemonge> like that
[13:49:19] <nc90> it does not exist... obviously... there's .top
[13:49:27] <nc90> .bottom not exists
[13:49:32] <eddiemonge> oh you want bottom
[13:49:37] <eddiemonge> why do you want bottom?
[13:49:47] <m8> why a thing like this does't works? $('#myselect').on('change', function() {alert('test')})
[13:49:52] <m8> *dosen't
[13:50:01] <sacho> what makes you think it doesn't work?
[13:50:23] <m8> sacho, the google chrome consolle
[13:50:32] <sacho> which says what?
[13:50:38] <m8> nothin
[13:50:50] <sacho> and what makes you think it should say something?
[13:50:56] <nc90> eddiemonge: i need bottom, in calcs
[13:51:09] <m8> sacho, i want the alert show when i change selected element
[13:51:17] <eddiemonge> nc90: height plus top
[13:51:28] <tw2113> alerts don't show in the console
[13:51:28] <m8> sacho, the syntax it's right?
[13:51:32] <djQuery> m8, what type of element
[13:51:34] <tw2113> console.log() does
[13:51:38] <m8> djQuery, select
[13:51:49] <djQuery> m8, see ?demo
[13:51:49] <m8> tw2113, not in the console
[13:51:49] <bot-t> m8, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:52:06] <nc90> eddiemonge: so, jquery hasn't a built-in function to know 'bottom'? mmh.. strange!
[13:52:24] <ravenzz> nc90 no because you don't need it!
[13:52:24] <tw2113> maybe console.log('test') would help you
[13:52:30] <eddiemonge> nc90: not really.
[13:52:39] <sacho> nc90, the bottom compared to what?
[13:52:41] <nc90> ravenzz: why not? can you explain ?
[13:52:45] <ravenzz> elem.offset().top + elem.outerHeight();
[13:53:25] <ravenzz> nc90 because it is the offset from 0 0
[13:53:26] <m8> tw2113, but the alert will be showed if the test is working
[13:53:36] <ravenzz> x (left) and y (top)
[13:53:40] <tw2113> not in console
[13:53:49] <tw2113> alert is a little pop and an "ok" button
[13:53:52] <m8> tw2113, it's not the problem :D
[13:54:07] <tw2113> you checking console for feedback is half of the problem

[13:56:18] <m8> good
[13:56:26] <djQuery> m8, and alert is not debuging
[13:56:27] <eddiemonge> m8: if it works in fiddle then its your page that is broken and not that code
[13:56:36] <m8> djQuery, it's a simple test
[13:56:50] <m8> a really fast test
[13:57:10] <ravenzz> m8 seriously, you may learn to debug. You'd be an happier guy
[13:57:42] <m8> ravenzz, console.write
[13:57:46] <m8> console.error etc :D
[13:57:56] <ravenzz> -n
[13:59:31] <ravenzz> I should sign up for an english course by the way :°D
[14:00:37] <djQuery> john_k, well I don't think your this is what you think it is on line 15
[14:00:41] <djQuery> 16 rather
[14:01:42] <djQuery> john_k, $(this).dialog('destroy').remove();
[14:01:47] <john_k> djQuery:  the code works pretty fine.. im wondering just why it creates infinite instances of the dialog when clicking the link..
[14:02:57] <eddiemonge> john_k: because you are creating a new dialog every time you click the link
[14:03:13] <john_k> eddiemonge:  how can i avoid that?
[14:03:35] <eddiemonge> create one dialog (not in the click handler) and only open it when you click the link
[14:04:21] <djQuery> john_k, or check to see if dialog has allready been applied to outputHolder
[14:04:21] <john_k> eddiemonge:  so i should get rid of onclick();
[14:04:32] <tomshreds> Hi! Is there any way of selecting a google maps marker? I've tried so many ways it's been hours and I still can't select anything related to it.
[14:04:38] <tomshreds> Please & Thanks :D
[14:05:09] <john_k> djQuery:  that seems better.. how can i apply that
[14:06:55] <djQuery> john_k, sec
[14:07:16] <john_k> sure
[14:10:05] <lyrae> how do i bind a click event to an element, but exclude a child element
[14:10:13] <jtm> I am a bit confused on this logic
[14:10:41] <lyrae> $('#foo :not(.child-bar)).click(..
[14:10:46] <lyrae> some logic like that
[14:10:50] <eddiemonge> lyrae: if e.target == element return;
[14:10:51] <lyrae> so child-bar is a div inside #foo
[14:10:56] <djQuery> john_k, this should be a start
[14:10:57] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/6qgTr/1/
[14:11:00] <djQuery> gotta run
[14:11:04] <lyrae> eddiemonge: thanks let me tyr
[14:11:14] <jtm> I am doing $("input:file").wrap('<form>').closest('form').get(0).reset(); then $("input:file").unwrap(); but it doesn't seem to apply to all my input fields. Why?
[14:11:47] <john_k> Ill try it out
[14:12:33] <lyrae> if (e.target == $('.tooltip')) return false   didnt work
[14:12:49] <djQuery> john_k, minor change http://jsfiddle.net/6qgTr/2/   had to make outputHolder a global
[14:12:56] <eddiemonge> lyrae: do you know what e.target it? console log it
[14:13:02] <djQuery> other wise it would just be reset each time
[14:13:16] <john_k> djQuery:  okk
[14:13:23] <djQuery> later
[14:15:06] <lyrae> it is <a class="tooltip" href="#">
[14:15:34] <eddiemonge> lyrae: do console.log( typeof
[14:16:18] <lyrae> eddiemonge: object
[14:19:35] <eddiemonge> lyrae: sigh i http://jsfiddle.net/zaSyJ/
[14:20:57] <lyrae> eddiemonge: thanks..i was doing it a bit different (like i pasted earlier)
[14:21:01] <lyrae> this works and many thanks :)
[14:21:50] <freesteph> hi
[14:22:07] <freesteph> say I'm binding an event to a collection of selectors
[14:22:08] <freesteph> as in
[14:22:30] <freesteph> ('a').on('click', function(event) { // do something fun and interesting });
[14:22:59] <freesteph> this boils down to selecting all the 'a', putting them in an array, then foreaching to attach the handler, right?
[14:23:10] <freesteph> is this how it works internally, very roughly?
[14:23:32] <eddiemonge> somewhat
[14:23:55] <freesteph> there is a loop going on at some point, right?
[14:25:02] <eddiemonge> for that, on
[14:25:03] <eddiemonge> no
[14:25:18] <eddiemonge> freesteph: look up event handling for javascript
[14:25:25] <freesteph> eddiemonge: interesting, how does it avoid the loop
[14:25:27] <freesteph> oh okay
[14:25:29] <freesteph> going to do that
[14:25:30] <freesteph> thanks
[14:30:38] <drakedouay> i have an row saved to a variable. I want to access the first column in that row. How do I do this?
[14:32:02] <DarkKnightCZ> drakedouay: if its array, then variable[0], if its string, you need to split it (.split("delimiter") produces array)
[14:32:33] <drakedouay> DarkKnightCZ: it is an [object HTMLTableRowElement]
[14:33:29] <eddiemonge> then wrap it in jquery and find the td
[14:33:31] <drakedouay> DarkKnightCZ: nm, i figured it out
[14:33:36] <DarkKnightCZ> drakedouay: then object.row.cells[0] perhaps?
[14:33:58] <jonez> how do I make a selector that takes into account a bit of data added by .data()?
[14:34:37] <jonez> I have a series of LI tags, and each one has a datum added to it with the data() method. I want to be able to select just one.
[14:34:55] <ravenzz> ?filter
[14:35:04] <eddiemonge> jonez: if you are adding data then you already have the element
[14:35:20] <jonez> no, I add the data in a previous function.
[14:35:30] <ravenzz> jonez filter()
[14:35:33] <eddiemonge> jonez: then save it as a variable there
[14:35:34] <jonez> ravenzz, k ty
[14:35:35] <ravenzz> read the docs
[14:35:44] <jonez> I didn't know the right keyword to look for
[14:35:48] <jonez> please be nice to me.
[14:36:01] <tucan> http://codepad.org/LJq0kda4   could someone help me with this simple test page?  i just want to show a div and hide the rest when link is clicked
[14:36:12] <tucan> something's wrong wit my logic
[14:36:25] <DarkKnightCZ> tucan: jsfiddle it
[14:38:16] <DarkKnightCZ> tucan: and bind it to the .click() function => $("#alphabet a").click(function(){...});
[14:38:27] <DarkKnightCZ> and you don't have to use cordova... jquery is for mobile too
[14:38:58] <tucan> http://jsfiddle.net/tdd75/
[14:41:22] <tucan> is there anything wrong in lines 48-51
[14:44:17] <tucan> i did an alert and the variable id seems to be undefined
[14:44:46] <DarkKnightCZ> tucan: http://jsfiddle.net/yvDyQ/1/
[14:46:10] <tucan> oh
[14:46:19] <tucan> now i see
[14:51:14] <jtm> How does one replace the current $(this) with another var?
[14:51:25] <jtm> I have var photoForm = prototype.replace(/__name__/g, index);,  which is simply html
[14:51:35] <jtm> I want to replace $(this) to be that html
[14:51:44] <blindMoe> this = newVar;  ?
[14:51:54] <jtm> I tried  $(this) = photoForm;  doesn't work, and I tried  $(this).html(...) and that just inserts it.
[14:52:25] <jtm> blindMoe Uncaught ReferenceError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment
[14:52:47] <jtm> That's doing: $(this) = photoForm;
[14:52:52] <blindMoe> seems like there would be a better way than modifying "this"
[14:53:00] <blindMoe> yeah you don't want the $() part
[14:53:06] <jtm> hmm ok
[14:53:19] <jtm> Same error
[14:53:28] <blindMoe> I don't believe modifying "this" should be necessary though
[14:53:38] <blindMoe> can you jsfiddle your code?
[14:53:40] <jtm> I just want to modify the current "this"
[14:53:50] <jtm> it's highly situational, so it's hard to do :-/
[14:54:07] <jtm> I just want to know how to assign something in a .each to be equal to some code of html
[14:54:24] <jtm> because photoForm is simply pure html
[14:54:33] <blindMoe> store it in a variable other than "this" and use it as needed
[14:55:29] <jtm> I think $(this).replaceWith(photoForm);
[14:55:56] <s5fs> I'm using $("input").on("blur", myFunc) but it's not behaving as I'd expect with select lists. When I choose an item and then click in a different field, "myFunc" doesn't fire. When I click anywhere that is NOT a field, the event fires. Thoughts?
[14:56:31] <ravenzz> tucan another version http://jsfiddle.net/6hW33/
[14:56:53] <s5fs> I'm using jquery 1.8.x as well
[14:58:03] <eddiemonge> s5fs: change
[15:00:33] <s5fs> eddiemonge: thanks for the suggestion. I just tested "change" and it doesn't seem to work at all with my select lists.
[15:04:48] <s5fs> eddiemonge: I think I've got it now, thanks.
[15:05:23] <s5fs> eddiemonge: I'm using $("input").on("blur") and $("select").change() to cover both cases.
[15:13:22] <tucan> hmm im comparing the code with my original one
[15:13:35] <tucan> and i honestly dont know what i did wrong
[15:13:39] <tucan> in my version
[15:16:02] <fonko> guys does anyone know a fix for the flip effect i have in this site when you click lower right corner of any new? (flip effect) http://www.goesenlinea.com/pruebainpulse/
[15:16:10] <fonko> for ie, is not working OFCOURSE
[15:18:53] <someprimetime1> What's the best feature detection for ie7/8?
[15:19:53] <akkufomk> fonko: My IE9 seems to display ok as well as firefox
[15:20:08] <someprimetime1> !$.support.leadingWhitespace?
[15:21:45] <tw2113> what feature are you trying to detect
[15:37:28] <dragonshed> so is there a good solution to mirroring an element's width dynamically, where the target element's width is a percentage and most likely has a sub-pixel length?
[15:37:54] <dragonshed> I'm getting an off-by-one issue due to .width() returning int
[15:49:50] <Axel__> hey folks
[15:50:12] <Axel__> I need some help with my code
[15:52:50] <Assimilater> is there a way with jquery to clear a cached image? (odd question probably)
[15:58:46] <Assimilater> I ask because my ajax image uplaod works great, but when it reloads the window it shows a copy of the cached image instead of the new image that overwrote it: dottest.aquaveo.com/index.php?sMap.php (though the actual upload probably won't work on this deployment, having IIS difficulties but works great on my ubuntu virtual box, other than the caching issue)
[15:58:59] <Assimilater> http://dottest.aquaveo.com/index.php?sMap.php for lazy link
[15:59:16] <eddiemonge> php on iis? for the love of ...
[15:59:20] * Assimilater should just copy paste http://dottest.aquaveo.com/index.php?q=sMap.php
[15:59:29] <Assimilater> eddiemonge: i know, the politics at my work are interesting
[15:59:39] <Assimilater> eddiemonge: if I had my way we'd get rid of it
[15:59:40] <eddiemonge> nothing there
[15:59:54] <Assimilater> eddiemonge: i typoed it see third link for third time's a charm
[15:59:56] <Assimilater> srry
[15:59:58] <eddiemonge> then be the catalyst for change and make it happen
[16:00:11] <eddiemonge> This webpage is not available
[16:00:11] <tdignan> third link doesn't work
[16:00:19] <Assimilater> oh boy
[16:00:23] <Assimilater> srry guys /me fixes
[16:00:30] <Assimilater> it's on drupal (another thing I"d like to get rid of)
[16:00:35] <dragonshed> repost:  Is there a good solution to mirroring an element's width dynamically, where the target element's width is a percentage and most likely has a sub-pixel length?
[16:00:38] <tdignan> there's a time and place for change
[16:00:52] <tdignan> and a place that uses iis and php is probably not it. that's a time for escape.
[16:00:57] <Assimilater> wait what?
[16:01:16] <Assimilater> this doesn't work? http://dottest.aquaveo.com/index.php?q=sMap.php
[16:01:16] <tdignan> your last link (3rd) did not work
[16:01:28] <tdignan> affirmative, it does not.
[16:01:38] <Assimilater> does it not resolve or what's the issue?
[16:01:59] <tdignan> http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/http://dottest.aquaveo.com/index.php?q=sMap.php
[16:02:31] <Assimilater> like does it say connection timed out or show an error?
[16:06:18] <Assimilater> srry guys, try this one http://dot.aquaveo.com/index.php?q=sMap.php
[16:06:26] <Assimilater> though again, the actual upload won't work
[16:07:06] <eddiemonge> then what are we looking at?
[16:07:15] <Assimilater> click on one of the icons
[16:07:19] <Assimilater> and there's a picture
[16:07:23] <Assimilater> and an update picture button
[16:07:30] <Assimilater> that uploads a new image to the server and overwrites the old one
[16:07:40] <Assimilater> and then refreshes the info window
[16:07:43] <Assimilater> but when it reloads it
[16:07:46] <Assimilater> it shows a cached image
[16:08:03] <Assimilater> sorry, old chat habbits over multiple lines.....
[16:08:29] <eddiemonge> im so confused. why dont you just take a screencast
[16:10:38] <Assimilater> http://prntscr.com/zy7u4
[16:11:27] <Assimilater> so that update picture button opens a select file dialog and uploads it to the server, then calls the ajax for the whole white window again (effective refresh, except for that image)
[16:12:36] <shwaiil> hi
[16:12:37] <eddiemonge> Assimilater: serve it with a different name then
[16:13:05] <eddiemonge> the server is probably telling the browser to cache it so why wouldnt it?
[16:13:07] <Assimilater> eddiemonge: the name is a guid which represents the project that image is tied to...can't change the name
[16:13:31] <eddiemonge> Assimilater: then tell the server not to send the cache params
[16:13:46] <shwaiil> Q: what do u guys do for "loading" animations ? I'm quiet tired of using GIF animations, specially because they don't render very well when over dark background images. I suppose everyone's animating PNG with JS or CSS3 ?! Any comments ? Thanks
[16:14:47] <Assimilater> hmm, srry guys, really scatter brained should go about trying to figure out why the server's not setting that non-caching correctly, thanks eddiemonge for your patience through my manicness :P
[16:15:33] <eddiemonge> shwaiil: then put a message up so the image isnt over a dark background. or make a better image
[16:23:57] <shwaiil> eddiemonge, tks for looking! I guess you understand GIF as limitations, that leads to the issues I mentioned before. I guess there's existing solutions, as animated png images, by using js and css3
[16:24:36] <eddiemonge> i dont think its worth it for such a small effort. your loading image should only be shown for a very, very tiny amount of time
[16:25:12] <shwaiil> eddiemonge, can matter for bigger applications for non cached ajax calls
[16:26:15] <shwaiil> gif transparency is terrible, being boolean, as it doesn't support semi transparency or alpha channels.
[16:26:35] <shwaiil> thanks for your time though eddiemonge
[16:29:55] <shwaiil> actually found a very good solutions >= IE6
[16:29:57] <shwaiil> http://neteye.github.io/activity-indicator.html
[17:05:39] <guideX> can someone help me? Why isn't my background image none? http://jsfiddle.net/VpkTf/

[17:57:17] <SupaLoused> Hi
[17:57:53] <guideX> hey
[17:58:45] <guideX> any idea why this doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/VpkTf/5/
[17:58:53] <guideX> trying to remove the last breadcrumb
[18:02:18] <SupaLoused> I have this site made in flash http://www.kobrex.com/ and i'm converting it into html, so far so good but i just don't know how to do the map in contacto. I just don't know very much of jquery, so i was wondering if someone could guide me please
[18:02:52] <SupaLoused> this is the html version http://www.tallerdeingenio.com/kob/
[18:03:43] <SupaLoused> please excuse my poor english
[18:14:58] <chrisTech> http://pastebin.com/7NDVVA22 This works in all except Firefox. I googled and found out this is a firefox-specific issue. My pastebin also contains what I've tried based off what I've understand from solutions on the net. Anybody see what I'm doing wrong? Thanks :)
[18:20:28] <guideX> I found the best way was with css "#main .breadcrumb a:last-child:after {"
[18:22:50] <Andrew_R> chrisTech: I updated your code to be a little more jQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/LjpVf/
[18:25:38] <john_k> how can i avoid creating a new dialog everytime a click the link in the list http://jsfiddle.net/6qgTr/
[18:27:22] <YammYcoding> hello folks!
[18:27:49] <Andrew_R> john_k: this is jqueryui?
[18:28:15] <john_k> Andrew_R: yes.. the jquery ui dialog
[18:28:38] <YammYcoding> I'm using jCarouselLite to slide some divs, and I wonder, while I mouse over the current slide, can have the slide animation paused ?
[18:29:18] <Andrew_R> john_k: probably something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/6qgTr/3/
[18:29:37] <Andrew_R> check to see if there are any visible .ui-dialog elements and return false if there are
[18:30:02] <john_k> Andrew_R:  ill give it a try
[18:30:09] <Andrew_R> actually, you might want to put that at the top of loadEmployeesShow()
[18:30:23] <Andrew_R> no need to do the load if you aren't going to use it
[18:31:52] <john_k> Andrew_R:  the dialog is not poping up this time
[18:38:43] <Andrew_R> john_k: I messed up the syntax, try if($('.ui-dialog:visible').length) { return false; }
[18:39:11] <Andrew_R> (you want to return if there is a dialog open, not the other way around.)
[18:40:18] <chrisTech> Andrew_R, Thanks man! Do you know a solution to this problem though? :)
[18:40:47] <Binbo> Hi guys, got an issue when using jqueryui draggable. When I set a div to be draggable outside its parent using appendto body, the div visually gets bigger when it is on drag. This does not happen when I dont use appendto
[18:40:55] <Binbo> anyone experienced this>
[18:42:14] <john_k> Andrew_R:  well that works pretty fine except that if i have multiple show() functions =/
[18:42:38] <resting> anyone uses flot? any idea if the number of ticks exceed the number that i specify is a problem or a normal behaviour?
[18:43:01] <Andrew_R> john_k: the only way I know of is to not run .dialog() again if one is already showing
[18:43:54] <Andrew_R> I guess, you could set the modal option to true when you set it up, which would prevent anything from happening behind the dialog.
[18:44:47] <john_k> Andrew_R:  im doing like a windows layout
[18:45:02] <john_k> =)
[18:48:10] <john_k> so i have to see if i can test that line with a particular dialog
[19:29:32] <alyis> With ajax I should be able to pull a value from php and display it dynamicly correct?
[19:29:52] <alyis> So like run an ajax script every second and get the new value from php?
[19:30:24] <innociv> yes
[19:31:26] <alyis> Thanks, now to figure the ajax part out haven't used it before.
[19:32:36] <alyis> What is the data: part?
[19:33:09] <alyis> http://pastebin.com/d1g1YQJ6
[19:33:41] <chrisTech> What is the purpose of the parameter inside a function() (eg. $('#something').click(function($whatsThis) {some function here...}))?
[19:33:59] <innociv> To bind them when the function is called
[19:34:01] <resting> how do i pass a param to the modal dialog?
[19:34:25] <chrisTech> innociv, is that answer for me? :)
[19:34:50] <innociv> Yes
[19:43:58] <Andrew_R> alyis: making an ajax call every second isn't going to work out so well
[19:44:06] <Andrew_R> and that's a lot of extra load to put on your server
[19:44:52] <alyis> Ahh okay
[19:46:13] <alyis> http://pastebin.com/6t5ER0jE
[19:46:39] <alyis> Got it nevermind
[19:46:53] <Andrew_R> resp onse/result :)
[19:47:22] <alyis> Yeah
[19:47:33] <alyis> result was filler i put forgot to change it
[19:47:47] <alyis> How would I set the ajax to run every x seconds
[19:48:17] <Andrew_R> use setTimeout
[19:55:30] <alyis> Thanks that worked
[20:48:19] <scar> anyone know how to stop bxslider from adding z-index to the slides?
[20:57:15] <davidlwatsonjr> what's your end goal there? do you need to show something over the slides?
[21:08:53] <nesoi> so it's taking an entire second to popup this popup in one place, and in another place it takes about 300ms, with much more data in it... how can I diagnose and fix this?
[21:10:22] <davidlwatsonjr> are you waiting on an ajax response to show the popup or is all the data loaded?
[21:11:12] <nesoi> it's a phonegap app, and everything is local both times davidlwatsonjr
[21:12:47] <davidlwatsonjr> can you debug using chrome devtools? if so, check out the timeline tab.
[21:13:39] <nesoi> I can't... unfortunately. What I notice though is that if I do console.log the text comes out immediately when I tap, but the popup still takes 1 second to appear... hm
[21:15:14] <davidlwatsonjr> you could use console.time('whatever') and console.log('whatever') around certain parts of your javascript to see if you can find the culprit....
[21:15:30] <davidlwatsonjr> sorry, that second one should be console.timeEnd('whatever')
[21:15:52] <nesoi> I tried that and it apparently takes no time
[21:15:56] <nesoi> just thought of something though...
[21:18:25] <davidlwatsonjr> alright, well, gonna get off here for a bit. @davidlwatsonjr on the twitters if you want a second eye or anything

[21:29:20] <nesoi> hm. that worked slightly, but it's still super slow
[21:48:19] <diverdude> I made this expandable panel: http://jsfiddle.net/jD7na/ However the problem is that the text jumps up when the panel is expanded. How can i avoid that?
[21:51:01] <Andrew_R> diverdude: don't change position to absolute
[21:51:19] <trinadh> remove position absolute
[21:51:31] <diverdude> Andrew_R, if i dont do that then it dont expands on top of the text
[21:51:59] <trinadh> http://jsfiddle.net/jD7na/1/
[21:52:03] <Andrew_R> then you'll have to absolute position the text as well
[21:52:34] <Andrew_R> or give it a margin-top:40px should work

[22:12:01] <da-beginner> hi all.. i have the 'facebook' slide feature here that i test.. however, the "click" to make it return to the page doesn't seem to work on mobile.. can someone explain why?
[22:12:03] <da-beginner> http://sydney.wranga.com.au/slide/
[22:12:42] <da-beginner> and by phone i mean iphone
[22:16:45] <diverdude> Andrew_R, problem is i cannot set the content to be absolutely positioned because that will break the flow in the page
[22:17:28] <Andrew_R> can you make your #panel absolute to begin with?
[22:18:24] <Cork> diverdude: you could add a wrapper around the panel
[22:18:38] <Cork> and have it take the original height of the panel
[22:19:08] <diverdude> i fixed it. it seems to work if i just remove position:absolute around my context
[22:19:29] <Cork> ..., wasn't that exactly what Andrew_R said?
[22:41:47] <sheilablackrose> hi i guys, im getting this error when i use ie8 mode SCRIPT257: Could not complete the operation due to error 80020101.
[22:41:54] <sheilablackrose> any ideas for a workaround
[22:42:00] <Z3R0> don't use ie8? lol
[22:42:43] <sheilablackrose> lol i wish!
[22:43:33] <Cork> sheilablackrose: make sure you don't have trailing commas and things like that
[22:43:50] <Cork> 80020101 is parsing errors
[22:45:21] <sheilablackrose> trailing commas
[22:45:23] <sheilablackrose> ok ill chekc that
[22:45:39] <sheilablackrose> on that particular js right
[22:50:40] <Cork> sheilablackrose: might be anywhere on the site
[22:50:57] <Cork> ie<9 file/row reference sucks hard
[22:51:58] <nights> interesting
[22:52:19] <nights> i thought a xhr request is always shown in chrome
[22:52:22] <nights> as its fired
[22:52:26] <nights> even if there is no response
[22:52:47] <nights> but if i sleep in the server side code the request doesnt show up at all
[22:52:49] <nights> is that right?
[22:55:39] <Kocho> hi there, does anyone know of any accordion style content sliders which would allow me to have content and images as the button and content and images in the slider?

[23:05:13] <Geneller> hi everyone, i've got a weird issue, could help me please ? http://bin.cakephp.org/view/2100260231
[23:05:17] <Geneller> the error i'm getting is TypeError: $(...).on is not a function
[23:08:05] <jacta> Is there a way to do this, seems like it wont worrk, im 100% sure that the url in strImages is correct: var strImages = strImage.attr("src").replace("/575","/85"); $("#Thumbs img[src$=strImages]");
[23:08:15] <jacta> cause it work if I copy the src down instead
[23:10:29] <simius> try change it to $("#Thubs img=[src$=" + strImages + "]);
[23:10:49] <simius> Thumbs*
[23:16:19] <didiergm> Geneller please show a bit more code where the error is displayed
[23:16:37] <nights> did anyone implement long pulling ?
[23:55:20] <Cork> nights: long pulling isn't hard to generate
[23:55:34] <Cork> its just a few lines of nested $.ajax calls
