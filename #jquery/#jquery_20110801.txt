[00:25:56] <dorigentoo> hi
[00:26:23] <dorigentoo> Can I check somehow if a <a> already has a .click() event binded to it ?
[00:27:16] <Cork> dorigentoo: $(elm=).data('events') if i remember correctly
[00:27:25] <Cork> $(elm)*
[00:27:38] <dorigentoo> oh awesome :)
[00:27:41] <dorigentoo> thanks Cork
[00:27:46] <Cork> np
[00:30:51] <gnarf> dorigentoo: debugging purpose only i hope
[00:31:13] <gnarf> cuz there is always a better way to solve a double binding problem than to check if you already bound
[00:31:38] <dorigentoo> Yes I'm having a stupid reassignment while looping on elements to ajaxify the links
[00:33:10] <gnarf> dorigentoo: can we see some code? might be able to point you at a much cleaner solution
[00:33:28] <dorigentoo> Would be very nice from you gnarf :) here is the code http://paste.pocoo.org/show/450378/
[00:33:58] <gnarf> so
[00:34:05] <dorigentoo> It works fine when the links and the container are differents, but if I'm having the links in the container, I get this duplication
[00:34:06] <gnarf> does the #user_details div get replaced?
[00:34:10] <gnarf> nah
[00:34:14] <gnarf> its something inside right?
[00:34:20] <gnarf> you could use ?delegate
[00:34:20] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[00:34:36] <gnarf> $("#user_details").delegate("a", "click", function() { });
[00:34:57] <dorigentoo> oh I didn't know about delegate
[00:35:06] <gnarf> delegate also powers live
[00:35:11] <gnarf> ?live
[00:35:12] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[00:35:27] <gnarf> you can do $("#user_details a").live("click", handler)
[00:35:44] <gnarf> thats the same as doing $(document).delegate("#user_details a", "click", handler)
[00:35:56] <dorigentoo> ok nicer
[00:35:58] <gnarf> the second i think just reads a little better
[00:36:05] <gnarf> as a clue of whats happening
[00:36:10] <dorigentoo> hmm ok
[00:36:13] <gnarf> but if the #user_details doesn't get replaced
[00:36:24] <gnarf> i'd suggest binding there
[00:36:46] <gnarf> its a micro optimization, but it makes more sense to bind those types of events as close to the target area
[00:37:00] <gnarf> they work by capturing ALL click events and testing the target elements vs the selector
[00:37:30] <gnarf> so if you delegate it on #user_details it will only eat up that test on the clicks inside #user_details
[00:38:40] <dorigentoo> ok
[00:38:48] <dorigentoo> Thanks I'll work on this
[00:39:02] <gnarf> also
[00:39:12] <gnarf> if its the type of situation that a live/delegate doesn't solve
[00:39:22] <gnarf> ?newContent @dorigentoo
[00:39:22] <bot-t> dorigentoo, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[00:39:34] <gnarf> thats a little plugin i whipped up for my own use
[00:39:46] <gnarf> every now and then you want to do more than just bind an event
[00:39:52] <SoulRaven> how i detect if a button is cliked inside a ui dialog?
[00:40:03] <dorigentoo> ok I'll look at it
[00:40:09] <gnarf> SoulRaven: you can bind a click event to the dialog widget
[00:40:19] <gnarf> .dialog( "widget" ) will return a jQuery element
[00:40:36] <gnarf> that is the container
[00:40:55] <gnarf> you can .find( "button" ) and .bind( "click" ) it from there
[00:41:17] <SoulRaven> i will try now, i m new in jquery
[00:41:44] <gnarf> we all were at some point ;)
[00:42:18] <SoulRaven> gnarf: http://pastebin.com/1ZiFnEEL
[00:42:26] <SoulRaven> now i am ussing something like this
[00:56:59] <solidus-river> whats the recomended way of making a filter on a bunch of lis
[00:57:03] <solidus-river> *li's
[00:57:34] <solidus-river> should i just take form input and on keyup hide all li's not matching the input string unless its blank
[00:57:45] <solidus-river> thats how i'd imagine but i feel like jquery might have something nice built in for such things
[00:59:05] <djcoin> Hi folks, im struggling making ajax file upload, how should I do this ?
[01:01:49] <solidus-river> djcoin: http://www.webdeveloperjuice.com/2010/02/13/7-trusted-ajax-file-upload-plugins-using-jquery/
[01:02:30] <solidus-river> djcoin: whoa whoa whoa, i didnt filter that, i would search around, that link seems pretty bogus
[01:03:09] <djcoin> ho
[01:03:13] <djcoin> solidus-river: thanks anyway
[01:03:37] <solidus-river> djcoin: it looks like it has some options but i'm guessing it has biased options
[01:05:49] <gnarf> solidus-river: filter on what?
[01:05:54] <SoulRaven> please help me to find when i click on some buttons insude ui dialog
[01:05:54] <SoulRaven> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1795238901
[01:06:15] <SoulRaven> now i am try like in the code above, but is not working:(
[01:06:33] <solidus-river> gnarf: found it, i'm using .find on li's with .filter, and only showing those that match
[01:06:43] <gnarf> console.log( $("#dialog").dialog("widget").find("button") );
[01:06:50] <gnarf> it should be all the buttons in your dialog
[01:07:28] <gnarf> solidus-river: i think there was a ui demo
[01:07:43] <gnarf> but yeah
[01:08:00] <SoulRaven> gnarf: is not return anything
[01:08:01] <SoulRaven> :(
[01:08:08] <gnarf> are the buttons
[01:08:11] <SoulRaven> on []
[01:08:14] <gnarf> are they <a> ?
[01:08:21] <gnarf> or are they <button>
[01:08:26] <gnarf> its a css selector
[01:08:27] <SoulRaven> button
[01:08:30] <gnarf> so figure it out
[01:08:36] <gnarf> inspect the dialog
[01:08:48] <gnarf> is $("#dialog").dialog("widget") what you expect?
[01:09:40] <solidus-river> gnarf: actually i could use some help. I want to filter, but not based off of the text inside the li but based off of the attribute "text"'s value of the li dom elements
[01:09:59] <gnarf> solidus-river: you might actually be able to use css for that
[01:10:11] <gnarf> can you mock me up the html of the <ul>
[01:10:17] <gnarf> in a jsfiddle
[01:10:18] <gnarf> ?
[01:10:41] <solidus-river> gnarf: never really used jsfiddle before, i'll work on it, but for now the li is set to "var a = $('<li/>', {text: element.name, value: element.id})"
[01:10:57] <solidus-river> where element.name and element.id are responses from a json query
[01:10:57] <gnarf> thats actually calling .text()
[01:11:03] <gnarf> btw
[01:11:08] <gnarf> so it is ilterally the text
[01:11:10] <gnarf> but
[01:11:21] <gnarf> your idea of not using the .text is a pretty good one
[01:11:34] <gnarf> you've created all these li's?
[01:11:54] <gnarf> set an actual attribute
[01:11:55] <solidus-river> yeah, thier generated from ajax requests ina context sensitive menu
[01:12:05] <gnarf> like .attr("data-text", element.name)
[01:12:30] <gnarf> then you could $("li").hide().filter("[data-text^='OM']").show();
[01:12:35] <solidus-river> $('li', t.element).filter('some text to filter based on').show(); hides everything
[01:12:54] <solidus-river> gnarf: woudl that be faster than filtering just based off of text?
[01:12:57] <gnarf> ?attribute begins with
[01:12:58] <bot-t> gnarf, Attribute Starts With Selector [name^="value"] - Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value beginning exactly with a given string. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[01:13:05] <gnarf> solidus-river: its a css selector
[01:13:12] <gnarf> its gonna be super fast
[01:13:20] <gnarf> ( in modern browsers )
[01:13:55] <gnarf> at least
[01:14:31] <gnarf> I think its gonna be faster than $("li").hide().filter(function() { return $(this).text().indexOf("OM") == 0 }).show();
[01:14:59] <gnarf> you can use a site like jsperf.com to help you figure it out if it ever becomes a problem
[01:15:09] <gnarf> but using the DOM attr seems like its prolly the best
[01:15:26] <gnarf> in my head at least
[01:15:30] <gnarf> if thats worth anything
[01:15:30] <gnarf> :)
[01:16:06] <solidus-river> gnarf: haha, it sounds solid, I'm trying it now
[01:16:30] <gnarf> just FYI
[01:16:39] <gnarf> the only character you need to escape inside of the quotes is quotes
[01:16:54] <gnarf> on the attr selectors
[01:17:13] <gnarf> you can [data-text^='om]']
[01:17:15] <gnarf> and it will work
[01:17:27] <gnarf> but you need to replace ' with \'
[01:18:14] <gnarf> "[data-test='" + term.replace(/'/g, "\\'") + "']"
[01:21:24] <gnarf> ?glwt @solidus-river
[01:21:24] <bot-t> solidus-river, Good Luck With That
[01:21:27] <gnarf> bedtime for me
[01:21:29] <solidus-river> gnarf: you've lost me in your grep / sed / awk basis
[01:21:49] <solidus-river> gnarf: lol, thanks, i'll fiddle around with it, i have it set up but its still hiding everything
[01:21:55] <gnarf> ?p
[01:21:55] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:21:56] <gnarf> ?
[01:22:03] <gnarf> get it into a fiddle
[01:22:05] <gnarf> ;)
[01:22:06] <gnarf> quick
[01:22:18] <gnarf> just the ul, input, and event
[01:22:23] <solidus-river> kk
[01:22:27] <gnarf> all you should need right?
[01:22:36] <solidus-river> hmm, but the ul is dynamicaly generated, right?
[01:22:48] <gnarf> who cares for now
[01:22:51] <gnarf> copy the generated html
[01:23:04] <gnarf> or fake some ajax data
[01:23:05] <gnarf> :)
[01:23:24] <solidus-river> ahh, i dont want to keep you up, i'll wrestle with it a little, it'll be good for me
[01:23:37] <solidus-river> it'll take me a while to get it into the jsfiddle
[01:25:00] <solidus-river> gnarf: thanks :)
[01:25:33] <Paveloosha> Hi guys.. "easeOutExpo" works with "queue"?
[01:27:12] <Ywo> Hi
[01:27:48] <Ywo> When I have a background-image in my div, and I use background-size contain to make it resize to the div width/height
[01:28:04] <Ywo> Is it possible to get the background start position + width/height? (through jQuery)
[01:29:38] <solidus-river> gnarf: FYI i found the bug, i was selecting my elements incorrectly to filter
[01:30:12] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/kUhbF/ @solidus-river ;)
[01:30:48] <Paveloosha> Hi <gnarf>, "easeOutExpo" works with "queue"?
[01:31:07] <gnarf> queue is not an animation function
[01:31:36] <gnarf> rather than ask some tangental question, why not say what you're trying to accomplish?
[01:32:11] <solidus-river> gnarf: woah! i'm doing mine via text search and not css and it is definitely slower :P
[01:33:23] <maxmac> Hi! I want to get an object from an ajax response, and doing it this way: var showMore = $($("<div>" + data + "</div>").html()).filter("a.button"). There has to be a simpler way no?
[01:33:28] <Paveloosha> I am using $('.sidedatapanel').animate({top:($(document).scrollTop())+"px"},{duration: 1000, queue: false },'easeOutExpo') ; Now here easing is not working..
[01:34:34] <krz> [Object { cached_slug="ruby", created_at="2011-08-01T03:40:27Z", description="Ruby programming language", more...}, Object { cached_slug="ruby-on-rails", created_at="2011-08-01T03:40:27Z", description="Ruby On Rails web development framework", more...}] <-- how can i parse through this?
[01:34:36] <amit_usual> anyone know of any examples for using  dropbox using js/jquery
[01:37:21] <gnarf> http://jsperf.com/text-search-methods @solidus-river
[01:38:14] <gnarf> only 6% according to jsperf for chrome dev channel :)
[01:39:09] <gnarf> http://jsperf.com/text-search-methods
[01:39:21] <gnarf> seems firefox the text method wins quite dramatically
[01:39:46] <matjas> woah
[01:39:53] <TeddyMurray> woah
[01:40:27] <gnarf> opera too http://jsperf.com/text-search-methods
[01:40:43] <gnarf> i guess i can be wrong... ;)
[01:41:02] <Paveloosha> <gnarf>,I am using $('.sidedatapanel').animate({top:($(document).scrollTop())+"px"},{duration: 1000, queue: false },'easeOutExpo') ; Now here easing is not working..
[01:41:35] <gnarf> Paveloosha: add easing: 'easeOutExpo' to the {} containing duration and queue
[01:42:43] <gnarf> anyone got some IE's to throw at that perf? im curious now
[01:43:49] <Paveloosha> <gnarf>, {duration: 1000, queue: false, 'easeOutExpo'} -not working..
[01:44:16] <gnarf> easing:
[01:44:40] <gnarf> { duration: 1000, queue: false, easing: 'easeOutExpo' }
[01:44:55] <fantomas> Hi all. Is there an even, occuring when browser leaves a page?
[01:45:46] <gnarf> fantomas: yes, but what do you want to do on this event?
[01:45:52] <fantomas> I want the pages on my website to change smoothly - animate opacity
[01:45:56] <fantomas> gnarf: <
[01:46:09] <gnarf> fantomas: wont really work
[01:46:23] <gnarf> fantomas: make the whole page ajax replace itself
[01:46:26] <gnarf> and you can get that
[01:46:33] <fantomas> gnarf: yes, without AJAX I found it looks terribly
[01:49:44] <Paveloosha> <gnarf>, nope.. it is sopping animate function
[01:50:43] <gnarf> Paveloosha: do you have the easeOutExpo easing function?
[01:50:56] <Paveloosha> yap
[01:51:17] <gnarf> well, it should work
[01:51:18] <gnarf> ?p
[01:51:19] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:51:38] <gnarf> maybe someone else can help you find the problem
[01:52:19] <Paveloosha> its allright, thanks a lot for your help..
[01:52:38] <Paveloosha> help as always :)

[02:10:16] <maxmac> Hi! I want to get an object from an ajax response, and doing it this way: var showMore = $($("<div>" + data + "</div>").html()).filter("a.button"). There has to be a simpler way no?
[02:11:33] <Cork> maxmac: filter the data you send server side
[02:11:57] <Cork> thats the correct way, as it means you only send the data you need
[02:13:05] <Cork> maxmac: on the other hand $("a.button", data) should work just fine
[02:31:19] <maxmac> how can i get the contents of a div?
[02:31:50] <maxmac> $response.html() gets me the html, but the contents is not properly formatted, as it is just an ajax response with <tr> elements
[02:32:17] <graingert> jQuery.support doesn't seem to be able to check for canvas
[02:34:46] <maxmac> nm, it worked when the html was properly formatted

[03:36:22] <Mimo> hi guys.. what your thought on backbone.js ... use it or not?
[03:36:44] <blackspotwiggins> Mimo, if it does what you need - sure
[03:36:55] <blackspotwiggins> choose the right tool for the job
[03:37:37] <Fox`> shouldn't css('marginLeft', 0) be instant?
[03:38:05] <silverd> morning guys, I have an image map with some hotspots and assigned ids.  When the user clicks on a hotspot I would like to assign that particular hotspot with a colour.  I've tried using $().css() but that doesn't seem to register.  Anyone got any tips
[03:38:44] <Mimo> ok thanks blackspotwiggins. It makes the code more readable and structural, i gues
[03:38:57] <Mimo> so i was wondering if there where any cons
[03:39:08] <blackspotwiggins> yeah there are
[03:39:18] <blackspotwiggins> missing some stuff IMO
[03:40:34] <Mimo> ok thanks again (quick link for ppl who are interested http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5112899/knockout-js-vs-backbone-js-vs)
[03:42:01] <krz> at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask if you put "adsfasdjfjkasdfajsdkflasdf" in the tags section. what is triggering the blue box "adsfasdjfjkasdfajsdkflasdf" top appear at the bottom?
[03:43:09] <krz> is this keyUp?
[03:44:56] <SilentPenguin> krz, quite likely, i've done it before for an editor which previews while you type, note that it also works correctly for a paste, there's a seperate event for that too
[03:45:33] <krz> SilentPenguin yea whats the event for a past?
[03:46:33] <SilentPenguin> i'm not sure that's an important question, google around, you'll easily find out what techneque to use, I can't remember offhand
[03:46:37] <krz> SilentPenguin and second. if you delete some characters from "asdfalkjsdfjkadfjklaksjlfjkla" it updates the blue box that appears. however if you delete the characters via the mouse, it also updates. what even ttrigger are they using for this?
[03:47:43] <krz> mousedown?
[03:48:37] <SilentPenguin> if it's anything like mine, which it appears it is, the relivent events will trigger a function which then clears a timeout that was previously set and recalls setTimeout, so that it updates after someone finishes typing
[03:48:45] <Zelfje> how do i add a css class to a gmap image overlay? i tried $("div.gmnoprint img[src$='.png']".addClass("mystyle");
[03:48:51] <Zelfje> this didnt work, perhpas due to that the images are loaded last, after the markers
[03:48:56] <Zelfje> #googlemaps is dead :(
[03:49:06] <SilentPenguin> Zelfje, well, that's missing a bracket
[03:49:26] <SilentPenguin> but, i'm assuming it wasn't in the orignal code, otherwise it should have been obvious
[03:49:51] <Zelfje> yes behind the .png]" i have that in my code
[03:49:58] <SilentPenguin> right
[03:50:24] <SilentPenguin> well, then yes, the object you are referencing doesn't exist, google maps don't have an event you can watch?
[03:50:40] <Zelfje> overlays are loaded after the markers, and alredy called in a $(document).ready
[03:51:05] <Zelfje> there is an event click and so on function
[03:51:27] <Zelfje> not sure if that works on groundoverlays
[03:51:36] <SilentPenguin> so $("div.gmnoprint img[src$='.ping']") has length greater than one?
[03:52:34] <krz> what is the right trigger for: right-click then left-click on an element?
[03:52:41] <SilentPenguin> check in the object inspector by assigning it to a value, and breaking on the line when you add the class, there will be a length property inside the jquery object
[03:53:13] <Zelfje> ok
[03:54:18] <SilentPenguin> if it's 0, it's not finding anything, it won't tell you if the objects exist before you call $(), but what it will tell you it definately isn't finding them
[03:55:00] <SilentPenguin> since it could be as simple as your selector being the cause.
[03:56:27] <SilentPenguin> i'd also try setting a timeout around it to allow gmaps a couple of seconds to load
[03:56:58] <nachoelg> hello
[03:57:26] <krz> i dont understand how the element on that page is being triggered with a right-click delete
[03:57:42] <krz> i tried all sorts of mouse down
[03:57:49] <krz> and keyups and keydowns
[03:57:51] <krz> to no avail
[03:59:17] <krz> anyone?
[04:01:05] <SilentPenguin> it could just be checking periodically, put a breakpoint in the updating code to see if it's only called when you make modifications, and learn how to google things, we can't do all the thinking for you
[04:01:21] <krz> no shit
[04:01:39] <krz> who said i asked you to do ALL the thinking for me?
[04:01:48] <krz> this is my first question after several hours
[04:02:11] <Zelfje> alert($(".gmnprint img").get(-1)); gives undefined and appears before the map is loaded so indeed the object i refer to in $(document).ready does not exist yet.
[04:08:33] <solidus-river> 'night all :)
[04:10:44] <xec> Zelfje: is your script included last?
[04:14:05] <Zelfje> last as inside document ready after calling the initMap()
[04:14:43] <Zelfje> drawing the gmap take longer then adding css to the element so he fails
[04:16:06] <Zelfje> so its back to the drawingboard for me and try to make a custom overlay prototype \;(
[04:37:26] <Ahrengot> Hey guys - Quick RegEx question. Can someone help me remove 'RT @*username*:' from 'RT @someuser: blah blah blah'?
[04:41:19] <dirkpennings> Ahrengot: /RT.@(.+):./g
[04:41:20] <dirkpennings> ?
[04:41:48] <Cork> dirkpennings: thats keeping not removing :)
[04:42:03] <dirkpennings> no indeed, but that he can figure out I guess?
[04:43:05] <Cork> i would prob go with something like replace(/TR @[^:]*:/g, '')
[04:46:52] <Ahrengot> Thanks for the help guys :)
[04:46:54] <Ahrengot> take care
[04:57:47] <Aric> What is wrong with this code? -> http://www.pastie.org/2303378 -- if i replace the var reload line with "var reload = 10000;" it works refreshing my widget every 10s but the getJSON isn't working?
[04:58:32] <Aric> I've probably messed up some syntax, any help is appreciated :)
[05:00:00] <Cork> Aric: your construction is racy
[05:00:10] <Cork> Aric: put the actions for reload inside the callback
[05:00:23] <Cork> so you know that the value is downloaded when you try to use it
[05:01:50] <Cork> Aric: right now your doing var reload; start json call; load /w/; start setInterval; json callback called (aproximatly)
[05:01:57] <Aric> ok let me see what i can change, first time doing real ajaxy stuff
[05:03:13] <Topcat__> My jquery doesn't run when you come back to a page in drupal, it only works on a page refresh/firstload
[05:04:04] <Topcat__> $(window).load(function(){ and document ready do the same thing too
[05:04:16] <mazzachre> Using jquerymobile, when I load a page (via showPage) is there not a simple way of giving the subpage #xxx in the link? When I just do href="#home" it goes to the index page with a #home selector, which does not work, so must I do "mypage.html#home"? Will that work? I can see that the url is http://mypage/mobile/#/mobile/mypage.html to the page (loaded by ajax) so what to do about links within that page?
[05:05:16] <Cork> Topcat__: not really documen ready is called much earlier then .load
[05:06:02] <Topcat__>  Cork  : I was referring to my problem not the functions.
[05:06:11] <Cfooo> Hi im trying to get a bg-picture to stay the same size in all browsers with the plugin "full-sizebackground image" i've modified to the code some what but the aspect ratio isn't right.. Can somebody help me with this i would be very happy :)
[05:06:21] <Cork> Topcat__: ah, now i get what you meant
[05:06:28] <Topcat__> Any ideas ?
[05:07:23] <Topcat__> Something about the browser caching the page must be breaking it
[05:08:19] <Topcat__> It's not that the console gets errors in it. The script just runs all weird like it didn't initialize or something.
[05:10:36] <Topcat__> would including a old jqery before a new one mess things up?
[05:11:00] <Cork> yes
[05:11:11] <Cork> you would have to use noConflict()
[05:13:06] <Topcat__> that's stopped everything for working now
[05:13:35] <Topcat__> stuff like - Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'jScrollPane'
[05:14:19] <Cork> Topcat__: you need to rename your new jquery object to something
[05:14:26] <Cork> as it will remove its use of $
[05:14:58] <Topcat__>  Cork  yeah I need to read more first. JS error messages and just a notch below useless
[05:15:12] <Cork> ?.noconflict @ Topcat__
[05:15:12] <bot-t> Topcat__, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[05:16:27] <DevBrPb> Hi to all, anyone know how i can fix the problem of character encode in jqGrid, when i do a serach using accentuation don't found, if remove accentuation found...
[05:18:06] <Topcat__> ok errors are gone but now nothing is running.
[05:18:28] <graingert> nir0: use push state
[05:21:56] <Topcat__> noconflict didn't resolve it. anyone use waterwheel carousel that's what's breaking.
[05:24:10] <KingTarquin> I'm using jquery ui dialog output announcements on my site. I'm using .attr to get the id of the post from a custom attribute, but it's ignoring the custom attribute and always going for the latest entry.
[05:33:25] <bjhaid> i would like to pass an hyperlink into a jquery ui dialog, how can i enable this
[05:33:25] <bjhaid> ?
[05:33:52] <Cork> you can add it as a button
[05:34:04] <Cork> bjhaid: but what do you mean pass in?
[05:34:15] <Cork> there isn't really an "in" with ui dialog
[05:34:46] <bjhaid> is there is noway i can make a text an hyperlink in a dialog box
[05:35:10] <bjhaid> Cork: is there noway i can make a text an hyperlink in a dialog box
[05:36:30] <Cork> bjhaid: sure
[05:36:48] <bjhaid> Cork: how do i achieve this?
[05:36:56] <Cork> var dialog = $('#mydialog'); dialog.append(
[05:37:09] <Cork> '<a href=""></a>');
[05:38:21] <silverd> afternoon guys, anyone know how to add a style to a poly on an image map once a user has mouse over? (tried applying $(this).css( 'color','#000'), but it doesn't seem to have any effect)
[05:38:23] <bjhaid> Cork: var j = "<a href='http://10.10.5.104:8080/wakanow/index.php?module=Contacts&action=DetailView&record='" + e + ">" + b + "</a>", when i insert j in my dialog box, it displays the text and not the hyperlink
[05:39:07] <Cork> bjhaid: how are you adding it to your dialog?
[05:39:33] <Renex> hello
[05:39:41] <bjhaid> $("<div>").text(j)).dialog();
[05:39:47] <Cork> ah
[05:39:58] <Cork> don't use text
[05:40:25] <Cork> bjhaid: use html or append
[05:40:26] <bjhaid> Cork: that value is returned from a json, and I want to display it straightaway, how do i handle that
[05:40:32] <Renex> I am trying to use the resizable() feature of jquery ui on a image I have uploaded trough ajax but it doesn't work. should I use live() or smth else?
[05:41:40] <bjhaid> Cork: .html did the magic, thanks
[05:47:06] <nascro> Good morning folks. I need to check for the presence of "visibility: visible;" in a style attribute. Using the .attr() method, $n == 'visibility: visible;' returns true if it's the only statement in the style attribute, but not if there are multiple statements.
[05:48:07] <jamesbrink> hey guys, jquery/jscript noob here. trying to figure this one out. http://pastie.org/2303591
[05:48:32] <jamesbrink> i have a simple (yes it is messy) ajax call and append, followed by a .draggable from jquery-ui
[05:48:58] <fuchstronaut> having an array containing selectors, whats the best way to create a jquery object containing all these elements?
[05:49:02] <jamesbrink> the way i have done it, .draggable is not working.. now it works if i run that command after a timeout or if i do it manually in browser
[05:50:04] <nascro> All: see http://pastie.org/2303599 for reference to my query
[05:50:10] <jamesbrink> im thinking i am calling this method when the content is not yet ready, but im not sure how to fix it
[05:50:35] <fuchstronaut> oh right, i can do it by using .join :/
[05:50:38] <Sean-Der> $("#test").load("productgets.php?prodid=" + str);
[05:51:06] <Sean-Der> if str = 3 would that string concate to productgets.php?prodid=3
[05:51:12] <Sean-Der> ?
[05:51:30] <fuchstronaut> why not?
[05:53:04] <Cork> Sean-Der: yes it will
[05:56:41] <Fox`> argh wth. i have a slideshow made on altering the margin, and when i look at another browser tab and come abck the margin is something stupid like -192352px. then i wait a few seconds and it's back to normal
[06:03:59] <Fox`> looks like match() screws up when you change tabs o.O
[06:06:36] <jamesbrink> anyone have a chance to look at my paste?
[06:09:46] <grid_> heya
[06:10:21] <grid_> i'm looking for a script that could change <div id="player" style="visibility: visible;"> to <div id="player" style="visibility: hidden;"> can somebody help me?
[06:10:53] <erichynds> grid_: $("#player").css("visibility", "hidden")
[06:11:21] <grid_> erichynds: is that all?
[06:11:29] <erichynds> yeap
[06:11:32] <spliter> yes grid_ :)
[06:14:02] <sadmicrowave> anyone know of a way to animate a larger width and height while fadeing out at the same out?
[06:14:39] <sadmicrowave> putting the fadeOut in the animate callback will execute the fadeOut after the animate is complete, but I want these actions to happen simultaneously
[06:16:59] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: i think you can add a queue: false option to the first animate call which will prevent them from executing in order, then just chain them
[06:17:12] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, nice
[06:17:36] <sadmicrowave> currently I have nothing to try it on, I was merely speaking philosophically
[06:17:56] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: http://docs.jquery.com/Release:jQuery_1.2/Effects#Simultaneous_Animations
[06:18:06] <sadmicrowave> woot
[06:31:19] <nascro> Is it possible to find out if parent element includes a specific style attribute value?
[06:32:16] <nascro> i.e., check an element for "visibility: hidden;" in <style = "visibility: hidden; color: #eee;>
[06:32:28] <SoulRaven> i have created this plugin for jquery: http://pastebin.com/SwxAMFCr
[06:32:43] <SoulRaven> but i can't load multiple times on the same page
[06:32:50] <SoulRaven> please help me:(
[06:33:25] <kborchers> nascro: for your specific example you can use the :hidden selector, otherwise see ?attr
[06:33:25] <bot-t> nascro, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[06:33:29] <SoulRaven> i want to load something like: http://pastebin.com/7ckudvk8
[06:34:46] <nascro> kborchers, bot-t, I'm using the attr() method here without success: http://pastie.org/2303599
[06:35:01] <kborchers> ?imabot @ nascro
[06:35:01] <bot-t> nascro, -5 geek points for not noticing I am a bot.
[06:37:18] <kborchers> nascro: like i said, for visibility you could do var $n = $(this).parent().parent(":hidden"); then if($n.length) would be true if the element is hidden and false if not
[06:39:49] <nascro> kborchers: Thanks! Testing...
[06:40:00] <Flower21> Hi guys
[06:40:55] <Flower21> i have an easy question for you.. I got this scrollable div to work. But i want it to stop on mouse hover, and continue scrolling when my mouse is not hovering
[06:41:11] <Sean-Der> Can someone show me the correct syntax to select a nested div?
[06:41:26] <Flower21> http://tinyurl.com/3sx22hh
[06:41:39] <kborchers> Sean-Der: we would need to see your html to give you an accurate selector
[06:41:41] <Cork> Sean-Der: $('div.classname div'=
[06:41:42] <Flower21> How can i do that ?
[06:41:46] <Cork> *)
[06:42:40] <Sean-Der> cork: Classname refers to the parent div and div'= is the child?
[06:42:47] <kborchers> Flower21: you can use hover to bind to the mouseover/mouseout events then call your scrolling plugins start and stop methods (if it has them) see ?hover
[06:42:48] <bot-t> Flower21, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[06:43:06] <Cork> Sean-Der: do you know css?
[06:43:26] <Cork> Sean-Der: jquery uses the exact same syntax that css uses for its selectors
[06:43:36] <Flower21> Thanks, but how to stop the scroll ?
[06:43:38] <Flower21> .stop ?
[06:43:42] <Flower21> xD
[06:43:43] <Sean-Der> Cork: I know very little CSS just enough to get what I want
[06:44:10] <kborchers> Flower21: like i said, you need to read the docs on the plugin you are using for the scroll and see if they offer a way to start/stop it
[06:44:30] <Flower21> i read all of it, and theres none
[06:44:36] <Cork> Sean-Der: i would recomend to read up on css selectors
[06:44:42] <Flower21> im trying to customize that plugin
[06:44:48] <Cork> Sean-Der: its more or less a MUSH know to use jquery
[06:44:54] <Cork> MUST
[06:45:22] <Sean-Der> Ok I will
[06:45:50] <kborchers> Flower21: then you'll need to see how they animate (most likely using animate) and then figure out where to call stop()
[06:45:57] <kborchers> ?animate @ Flower21
[06:45:58] <bot-t> Flower21, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[06:46:03] <kborchers> ?stop @ Flower21
[06:46:03] <bot-t> Flower21, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[06:46:43] <Flower21> ok thanks

[06:47:48] <SoulRaven> please help me
[06:48:59] <AlexMax> Hi all.  I'm trying to use the TouchScroll plugin, and from what I've read about how to author plugins and my examination of the source code, it ought to work just fine.  However, none of the HTML elements end up with the touchScroll() function attached to it.  What's going on?
[06:49:08] <AlexMax> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/touch-scroll
[06:50:09] <kborchers> AlexMax: without seeing your code it's hard to answer your question. if i had to guess though, are you trying to run touchScroll on the elements before the dom is ready? see ?demo
[06:50:10] <bot-t> AlexMax, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:50:48] <jomofcw> SoulRaven why do you need to load it multiple time ?
[06:50:56] <jomofcw> When it is initialized, just use the function.
[06:52:12] <AlexMax> kborchers: Well, at a basic level I'm just loading both files.  The only 'oddity' is that I'm using jQuery Mobile and instead of waiting for a document ready I am using $('div').live('pageshow', function(event, ui)
[06:52:29] <AlexMax> but shouldn't that fire later than even the document ready?
[06:52:40] <nascro> @kborchers: following your direction, console.log() prints "Yes" twice in this example, but should only print once: http://pastie.org/2303817
[06:54:03] <nascro> @kborchers: ah, just saw this "Elements with visibility: hidden or opacity: 0 are considered to be visible, since they still consume space in the layout."
[06:54:04] <jomofcw> AlexMax If you call $ before it was defined it will undefined. If you call $(element) before element was defined, it will be undefined too.
[06:54:33] <kborchers> nascro: i was just typing that. you need to use display:none for :hidden to work
[06:55:16] <sadmicrowave> hey guys, I'm trying to get this jrumble to work...but it seems to conflict with my left margin: http://jsfiddle.net/2MTxB/
[06:55:17] <nascro> I'm not manipulating the DOM, though, I just want to check for the presence of visibility: visible; in the style attribute of a parent.
[06:57:53] <kborchers> AlexMax: i am not really familiar with jqmobile but i think you need to use $('[data-role=page]').live('pagebeforeshow', function (event, ui) { then select your div inside there and bind touchscroll
[06:58:40] <AlexMax> kborchers: Well, fwiw even after the page has completely loaded and I try to use .touchScroll() at a command line, it doesn't appear to be bound.
[06:58:56] <AlexMax> although $.fn.touchScroll does exist.
[06:59:38] <kborchers> AlexMax: hmmm, that is strange. you may have luck on #jquerymobile but they are usually pretty quiet over there
[06:59:52] <AlexMax> kborchers: ah thanks
[07:02:30] <kborchers> nascro: i would try this instead then var $n = $(this).parent().parent();  then, if($n.css('visibility') == 'visible')
[07:04:09] <nascro> @kborchers: var $n = $(this).parent().parent().attr('style'); returns the fill style attribute. Is it possible to search for certain characters in $n string
[07:04:09] <nascro>  
[07:04:35] <kborchers> nascro: yes, but the method i just posted is better
[07:04:55] <nascro> Doesn't the .css() method look at both inline and non-inline styles?
[07:05:37] <kborchers> nascro: this is actually a little more efficient  var n = $(this).parent().parent().css('visibility');  then, if(n == 'visible')
[07:05:41] <jomofcw> nascro it looks at the defined css for the element, don't car about the source
[07:06:08] <kborchers> nascro: was just typing that see jomofcw's response ^^^
[07:06:16] <jomofcw> kborchers ^^.
[07:06:39] <jomofcw> No troll here this afternoon, it's so quiet :/.
[07:07:31] <kborchers> ?troll @ jomofcw
[07:07:32] <bot-t> jomofcw, http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1261442/troll.swf
[07:07:34] <kborchers> ;)
[07:07:56] <jomofcw> Oh marvelous ! It made my day :D.
[07:08:00] <nascro> @kborchers @jomofcw yes. In this case, the style attribute is added via jQuery, the css changes from one value to another based on an event (IIRC).
[07:08:05] <Flower21> Is there someone that can explain to me or show me how i can stop my div from scrolling on mouse hover and continue on mouseout... i dont understand... :Â°(
[07:08:20] <Flower21> http://tinyurl.com/3sx22hh
[07:08:42] <kborchers> nascro: still doesn't matter. if the element has visibility: visible, that is what .css will return
[07:08:47] <jomofcw> nascro that's OK too, as I said it doesn't care about the source. It just return the css value in the fact.
[07:08:59] <jomofcw> kborchers :x You're quicker on this one ^^
[07:09:06] <kborchers> heh
[07:09:22] <nascro> @kborchers @jomofcw: Thanks for your responses. Testing now...
[07:09:35] <jomofcw> plz Flower21 JSFiddle it.
[07:09:41] <jomofcw> nascro you're welcome :)
[07:10:18] <kborchers> jomofcw: i always forget to give an epilepsy before that troll swf ... it is fun though ;)
[07:10:27] <kborchers> epilepsy warning*
[07:12:01] <Flower21> jsfiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/zvJyE/
[07:12:03] <jomofcw> kborchers I'm not dying anymore, that should be OK for me so :P
[07:12:09] <jomofcw> thanks Flower21
[07:12:11] <Flower21> thats the .js of the plugin
[07:12:19] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: trying to look at your fiddle but as usual jsfiddle is sleepy
[07:12:21] <Flower21> and i dont understand how it works
[07:12:28] <jomofcw> ... we won't debug all this one :/
[07:13:07] <Flower21> its not bugged
[07:13:17] <Flower21> i just need to know how to stop it from scrolling
[07:13:20] <Flower21> on mouse hover
[07:13:21] <nascro> That troll.swf is... something else!
[07:13:27] <Flower21> and continue on mouse out
[07:13:27] <jomofcw> Flower21 I think you already reasd the doc of this one ?
[07:13:48] <Flower21> yes i did
[07:14:05] <Flower21> i know how to stop , on mouse hover
[07:14:08] <jomofcw> stopAutoScroll startAutoScroll
[07:14:11] <Flower21> but not how to restart
[07:14:21] <Flower21> yes, but do i write this, and where :
[07:14:44] <jomofcw> You already try to bind the mouseout event ?
[07:14:45] <Flower21> im kinda new to jquery
[07:15:02] <jomofcw> Flower21 np I'm just trying to understand where is your prob and how to fix it.
[07:15:15] <nascro> @kborchers @jomofcw: The .css() method returns all visible elements regardless of their style attribute. Is it possible to return only the visible elements that are defined as style="visibility: visible;" ?
[07:15:41] <Flower21> yes : http://jsfiddle.net/zvJyE/1/
[07:15:51] <jomofcw> nascro hm should be hard :/.
[07:15:55] <Flower21> thats the part i created...
[07:16:00] <Flower21> not sure if its ok
[07:16:08] <kborchers> Flower21: like i said before, what ever element you are calling .smoothDivScroll on, then you need to bind .hover to that same element
[07:16:12] <kborchers> ?hover @ Flower21
[07:16:12] <jomofcw> Flower21 that's the part you should pastie
[07:16:13] <bot-t> Flower21, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[07:16:33] <jomofcw> And yea kborchers is really right, you could use the two handler of hover.
[07:16:40] <jomofcw> s/could/should/
[07:16:42] <karlradikarl> document.find('.TargetClass').closest("table").css('display:none');   <-- why i get a document.find is not a functon
[07:17:01] <kborchers> then in the handlerIn, call stopAutoScroll and in the handlerOut, call startAutoScroll
[07:17:12] <Flower21> i get that
[07:17:19] <Flower21> i just dont know how to write this in jquery :\
[07:17:44] <Flower21> should i create a new function?
[07:17:53] <kborchers> karlradikarl: i haven't seen your html but you can probably just do $('.TargetClass').closest("table").css('display:none');
[07:18:09] <nascro> @jomofcw hard how?
[07:18:26] <kborchers> Flower21: use an anonymous function. hold on i'll show you some pseudo code in a fiddle
[07:18:32] <jomofcw> nascro hard that I dunno if it's possible :x
[07:18:41] <jomofcw> but I really dunno too if you really need that...
[07:19:31] <Flower21> what is el.data in jquery ?
[07:19:37] <Flower21> i dont see any doc about this
[07:19:47] <karlradikarl> kborchers: but i dont have to use a class to find my element . i have to use find
[07:19:49] <Flower21> thats the equivalent of "var" in AS3 ?
[07:19:50] <jomofcw> and so karlradikarl because document should not be a jQuery object, so the kborchers solution is right
[07:20:03] <jomofcw> karlradikarl non sens
[07:20:12] <karlradikarl> kborchers: find a with href *
[07:20:16] <jomofcw> ? find @ karlradikarl
[07:20:17] <bot-t> karlradikarl, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[07:20:33] <jomofcw> selector aka "CSS selector" so using class and so much more thing
[07:21:08] <Gho5t> I need to change the default implementation of the jquery validation plugin. It doesn't start validating until after you've left the first textbox's focus. I need to start immediately: http://jsfiddle.net/sAMs9/
[07:21:30] <karlradikarl> like this find('a[href*="/de/"]').closest("table").css('display:none');
[07:21:46] <kborchers> Flower21: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/rJHH9/
[07:21:49] <karlradikarl> $.find('a[href*="/de/"]').closest("table").css('display:none'); can i use this?
[07:22:44] <jomofcw> karlradikarl nop
[07:22:53] <jomofcw> $('a[href*="/de/"]').closest("table").css('display:none');
[07:22:58] <jomofcw> Should be OK
[07:23:28] <jomofcw> In your example you don't specify any context, and IMO no default context using $ this way.
[07:23:29] <kborchers> karlradikarl: no, you can't use a regex in there just do  $('a[href*="de"]').closest("table").css('display:none'); if you're trying to find any a with an href that has "de" anywhere in it
[07:23:42] <jomofcw> haven't see the regexp xD
[07:23:43] <Flower21> kborchers, thanks !
[07:23:51] <karlradikarl> k
[07:24:08] <sadmicrowave> karlradikarl, whats up!?
[07:24:24] <sadmicrowave> kboardshorts, any luck yet?
[07:24:24] <Flower21> kborchers : something like that ?.smoothDivScroll(img.imgdiapo);
[07:24:52] <kborchers> sadistwasher: no, seems like it is having trouble loading stuff from dropbox
[07:25:04] <sadmicrowave> lame!
[07:25:42] <Gho5t> how can i make the jquery validator plugin begin validation as soon as you click in a textbox
[07:25:52] <Gho5t> http://jsfiddle.net/sAMs9/
[07:26:55] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, weird, it is loading fine for me
[07:27:27] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: hmmm, i get 403 forbidden on all of those. are you logged in to dropbox in the same browser in a different tab?
[07:27:44] <sadmicrowave> oops, yes
[07:28:13] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, is there another image hosting site for something like this?
[07:28:26] <SoulRaven> how i load a plugin multiple times on the same page?
[07:29:15] <Gho5t> dammit
[07:29:51] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: images is easy, you could use twitpic or something but the jrumble.js is also 403 and not sure where you could put that
[07:31:09] <nascro> @jomofcw: Yeah, what's happening is that when I click a map, a popup appears. The popup plugin applies a style attribute to the div. I want to perform animation inside of that div, not all divs.
[07:31:10] <kborchers> Gho5t: why would you want that. then your element would be marked invalid as soon as they click in it since it doesn't have a value. by default it does onfocusout so when they change fields, it will validate
[07:32:30] <Gho5t> well by default there is a date in there. when they start deleting characters it needs to delete them it's an invalid date. right now it will only do that if they click in the input and come back
[07:32:44] <Gho5t> kborchers: I get what you're saying though. is there a better way to do this?
[07:33:12] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, well then, I'll just figure it out on my own...rather than go through the trouble of posting
[07:34:00] <kborchers> Gho5t: on that single field, i think you could bind to the keyup event, then run validate on the form on every keyup on that date field. if it's a big form though, that's a little expensive in terms of performance but it would get the job done i think
[07:34:20] <Gho5t> yeah it's just one input
[07:34:29] <Gho5t> i did turn keyup to true in the plugin's setup
[07:34:43] <Gho5t> doesn't seem to change the fact that you have to click in/out first
[07:35:10] <npmapn> Is it possible to make jquery.autocomplete without having to click in a field first? I'm autofocusing a field and would like to receive autocomplete suggestions for it.
[07:35:38] <kborchers> Gho5t: that is why i said to actually bind to the keyup yourself and run validate() manually in there and turn off the keyup option
[07:35:52] <Gho5t> ah
[07:36:45] <kborchers> npmapn: you're using UI's autocomplete right?
[07:38:11] <Flower21> kborchers : i just dont get it, it wont work... jquery is so much more comlicated than as3
[07:38:14] <npmapn> kborchers: Autocomplete 1.0.2. It's something I must fix, not something I wrote and was pulling my hair over it.
[07:38:36] <Flower21> kborchers: been trying to make this working since the past 2 weeks
[07:38:47] <kborchers> npmapn: what is that? you're not using http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/?
[07:39:41] <npmapn> kborchers: It looks like it's an older version of that plugin, version 1.0.2.
[07:39:54] <SoulRaven> i want to call a plugin multiple times on the same page, how i do that?
[07:39:57] <SoulRaven> :(
[07:40:09] <kborchers> Flower21: make a fiddle showing me the html and javascript you are trying to get running. even if the fiddle doesn't work, i need to see what you are trying
[07:40:43] <kborchers> npmapn: i'm confused. so what version of UI are you using?
[07:40:48] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, what about a github? can js script tags link to those?
[07:40:55] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: yes sir
[07:40:57] <misterm__> SoulRaven: you just call it multiple times
[07:41:01] <sadmicrowave> I'll give it a try
[07:41:03] <npmapn> kborchers: It's just that plugin, I told you, it's not the entire UI.
[07:41:13] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: just use the link to the raw version of the file
[07:41:19] <TonyWanis> Any one need hosting
[07:41:31] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: you need to fix line 12 of your thing at the very least .   should be $.extend({}, defaults, options);
[07:41:43] <npmapn> kborchers: 1.7.1
[07:41:44] <ajpiano> oh nm, your defaults are being created on every invocation... awesome :/
[07:41:49] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, not found...the plugin's creation site has it linked to the creators server location, not a url path
[07:42:02] <kborchers> npmapn: then it's not that autocomplete because you need to at least include the UI Core and UI Widget and UI Position for it to work
[07:42:05] <TonyWanis> Anyone?
[07:42:15] <kborchers> ok, so UI 1.7.1
[07:42:24] <kborchers> npmapn ^^ ?
[07:42:34] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: it's not really clear to me at all why you're doing this as a "plugin"
[07:42:38] <SoulRaven> ajpiano: $.extend(defaults, options);
[07:42:47] <ajpiano> plugin is for things that can be done to any arbitrary sets of elements
[07:42:56] <ajpiano> not something you in voke on an empty jQuery object
[07:43:02] <ajpiano> do some code
[07:43:05] <SoulRaven> http://pastebin.com/7ckudvk8
[07:43:07] <ajpiano> and then have an empty return this.each(fn);
[07:43:34] <ajpiano> it's really unclear why you are developing this as a plugin
[07:43:54] <kborchers> npmapn: so after you focus the field, you should be able to call $("theField").autocomplete("search"); and it will show your list
[07:44:06] <ajpiano> autocomplete isn't in ui 1.7
[07:44:11] <kborchers> doh
[07:44:22] <kborchers> not sure what he's using then
[07:44:26] <SoulRaven> because i want to have the posibilty for add/remove rows on a table from a ui dialog
[07:44:41] <SoulRaven> and i need a method to call the add/remove feature from ui dialog
[07:44:42] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: i want to have the possibility to ride my unicorn to get the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
[07:44:58] <kborchers> npmapn: can you provide a link to the autocomplete plugin you are using (where you downloaded it from)
[07:44:59] <ajpiano> that doesn't mean i can just do $().unicorn()
[07:45:15] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: have you read the plugin authoring guide
[07:45:26] <kborchers> ajpiano: $.unicorn() is going to be in 1.7 though right?
[07:45:35] <ajpiano> yes
[07:45:39] <kborchers> heh
[07:46:06] <SoulRaven> ajpiano: this is how i call the 'plugin': http://pastebin.com/TDvNLXUy
[07:46:13] <npmapn> kborchers: It looks like it's an older version of this: http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-autocomplete/
[07:46:41] <kborchers> npmapn: then you need to upgrade to the UI version
[07:46:45] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: there is absolutely no reason for this to be a plugin
[07:47:00] <tra> which IE version supports <audio/> and should i use a flash approach for those poor ones that don't support? ideas?
[07:47:33] <SoulRaven> ajpiano: and how i do that? to initiate the add/remove function from ui dialog multiple times
[07:47:43] <ajpiano> you create a function
[07:48:10] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: any "plugin' where you're explicily disregarding the wrapped set
[07:48:18] <npmapn> kborchers: Thank you, I will give it a shot now.
[07:48:21] <ajpiano> and just calling some code based on the arguments you pass
[07:48:26] <ajpiano> means it shouldn't probaly be a plugin
[07:48:44] <kborchers> npmapn: no problem. once you upgrade, then you can do what i said calling search after you focus
[07:48:52] <Flower21> kborchers : http://jsfiddle.net/rJHH9/2/
[07:49:00] <SoulRaven> 2 functions, one for add and the secound for remove, and how i call the functions from ui dialog?
[07:49:09] <Flower21> i dont understand, thats the .js
[07:49:28] <ajpiano> the same way you call any other function
[07:49:34] <ajpiano> function foo() { };   foo();
[07:49:47] <Flower21> kborchers : and thats what im trying to do
[07:49:48] <jberglund1> tra: Only IE9 supports the audio-tag
[07:49:48] <Flower21> http://tinyurl.com/3sx22hh
[07:49:58] <Flower21> stop on mouse hover, continue on mouse ot
[07:50:00] <Flower21> out*
[07:50:44] <SoulRaven> and if i want to call the same functione multiple times on the same page?
[07:53:03] <kborchers> Flower21: try this http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/rJHH9/3/
[07:53:28] <kborchers> Flower21: that needs to replace the JS in your example
[07:55:02] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, alright, where/how do I upload my repo content?
[07:55:32] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: so you have no github experience?
[07:55:39] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, none
[07:56:21] <kborchers> ok, let's see if we can get something up simply. can't give you the full github rundown, just enough to get something going. have you signed up and have an account at github.com
[07:56:33] <sadmicrowave> yes
[07:56:44] <sadmicrowave> started a repo called jrumble-host.js
[07:57:01] <sadmicrowave> ran through the global-setup instructions, now just need to add the script content
[07:57:50] <Flower21> kborchers: that shoud give something like that, right ? http://jsfiddle.net/rJHH9/2/
[07:58:47] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, is it the $ git push -u command that I use to push the contents?
[08:02:47] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: ok, so you cloned your repo locally and are working most likely in the master branch of that repo right?
[08:04:07] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, yes?
[08:04:17] <kborchers> heh
[08:04:32] <kborchers> you did a clone right and haven't created any branches
[08:04:34] <sadmicrowave> I created the local dir and did all the git actions on that dir
[08:04:34] <kborchers> ?
[08:05:00] <sadmicrowave> I'm not sure what you mean by 'clone' I haven't done any cloning
[08:05:45] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, my 'tree' says 'master' so, yes, I'm working in the master branch
[08:08:43] <killfall> hi there
[08:09:37] <kborchers> i'm no git master but what i usuall do is create an empty directory for my repo, then create the repo on github (either new or fork an existing project), then on your new repo's main page, there is a URL and you use git clone URL in that new dir to clone the project locally. make sense?
[08:10:13] <sadmicrowave> yes, but how do I get content into the repo?
[08:11:02] <kborchers> then you just create a new item locally, in this case your js file
[08:11:11] <kborchers> then we get into keys :/
[08:11:24] <sadmicrowave> ok, hold on, let me add the file to the dir
[08:12:20] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, ok added, now my local dir has a README and my .js file
[08:12:27] <kborchers> ok
[08:12:42] <kborchers> are you on windows?
[08:12:47] <sadmicrowave> no
[08:12:56] <kborchers> hmmm, ok hold on
[08:13:20] <kborchers> OSX?
[08:13:29] <sadmicrowave> linux ubuntu10.10
[08:13:33] <KingTarquin> When using ajax in jquery ui tabs, how can you select a tab like how you can when the tabs are static?
[08:13:36] <kborchers> ok
[08:13:51] <sadmicrowave> KingTarquin, .live()
[08:13:59] <kborchers> did you go through this http://help.github.com/linux-set-up-git/?
[08:14:03] <sadmicrowave> .live('click',function(){ .... });
[08:15:10] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: boss needs me for a sec, read the portion on setting up keys on that link and i'll be back in a few
[08:19:34] <kapowaz> Is there a canonical carousel plugin for jQuery that most people would recommend?
[08:19:43] <kapowaz> I'm looking at jCarousel, and wondering if it's still the de facto
[08:19:48] <Gho5t> gho5t
[08:20:22] <Gho5t> kborchers[A]: can't seem to trigger the validate event: <input type="text" name="input1" required="true" id="input1" minlength="2" onkeyup="$('#form1').trigger('validate');" />
[08:21:21] <Gho5t> nvm i should probably just submit the form
[08:23:31] <alaing> how do you set focus to an element using jquery?
[08:23:39] <alaing> my element is a text field
[08:23:55] <kapowaz> $('input#my_element').focus() maybe ?
[08:24:06] <geekbuntu> kapowaz, yes http://api.jquery.com/focus/
[08:24:19] <kapowaz> geekbuntu: I'm well aware.
[08:24:21] <geekbuntu> if you need - you can defer functions
[08:24:23] <alaing> opps forgot the brackets
[08:24:26] <alaing> i had .focus
[08:24:32] <alaing> thanks kapowaz
[08:25:06] <geekbuntu> kapowaz, hope that didbn't upset your day too badly for me to answer the wrong person :-D
[08:25:21] <kapowaz> no worries.
[08:30:32] <hariom> Hi, I am opening up a new window to fill a form. Once the form is filled, user closes it. When the user closes the window, I want to notice this event so that I can update the details on the main form. How to know if a window is closed? I am opening up the window using this: window.open(...)
[08:31:25] <jberglund1> Isnt it easier to use an overlay in existing window?
[08:33:25] <killfall> can you not use a onunload="" in the body tag of the new window
[08:35:09] <jeffsmykil> I'm having a difficult time making an ajax call using a variable on the url line
[08:35:16] <jeffsmykil> is there something I need to know about this?
[08:35:35] <jeffsmykil> it seems to have something to do with the quotes
[08:35:46] <jeffsmykil> but when i put the quotes in it just gets converted to html charachter codes
[08:35:55] <sadmicrowave> kborchers[A], booya! http://jsfiddle.net/2MTxB/1/ !!!!
[08:37:19] <nascro> Does anyone know of a jQuery expert or pro that I could pay to talk to about a problem?
[08:37:44] <killfall> nascro: have a look on people per hour
[08:38:46] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: ok, back
[08:38:49] <jeffsmykil> the file is on my server of course
[08:38:56] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, got it working, check out the fiddle
[08:39:04] <kborchers> cool, you figured it out. ok, now i'll take a look. what was the issue again :P
[08:40:28] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: it's obviously not working right but what is it supposed to do?
[08:40:35] <jberglund1> jeff: Care to show the code?
[08:40:41] <sadmicrowave> lol, the jrumble function is overriding the new 'left' margin location of the images
[08:40:45] <jeffsmykil> ugh you cant read request variables
[08:40:54] <jeffsmykil> apparentlty thats the issue
[08:40:59] <jeffsmykil> that puts a big damper on things
[08:41:18] <Flower21> im goin to kill myself !!!
[08:41:21] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, margin starts off at left -50px, then animates to their needed positions, then on hover jrumble reverts back to -50px
[08:41:22] <jberglund1> What are you trying to achieve by sending variables in the url-field?
[08:41:24] <Flower21> :Â°(
[08:41:38] <Flower21> jquery is too complicated for my little brain
[08:41:42] <nascro> Is that the most reputable place?
[08:41:47] <jeffsmykil> jberglund1: I have several different xml files that i want to load based on the drop down combinations
[08:42:17] <jeffsmykil> each drop down has half the name
[08:42:29] <jeffsmykil> so dropdown1 + dropdown2 + ".xml"
[08:42:33] <jeffsmykil> is the path to the xml file
[08:43:09] <killfall> nascro: I would say so
[08:43:58] <jeffsmykil> jberglund1:  did that make any sense?
[08:45:51] <Flower21> can someone help me in private please ??
[08:45:56] <Flower21> i hopeless :(
[08:46:03] <Flower21> annd its not an hard problem
[08:46:04] <jeffsmykil> do you have a growth or a rash?
[08:46:17] <Flower21> kborchers tried to help me , but i think its too simple for him
[08:46:39] <Flower21> he even gave me code to make it working, but i dont understand , it dosnt...
[08:47:03] <nascro> @jeffsmykil Hahah
[08:47:25] <nascro> @kborchers: Solution: $(this).parent().parent('.foo[style*="visibility: visible;"]');
[08:48:01] <nascro> @kborchers: regarding earlier issue you were helping me with... if you can recall ;)
[08:48:28] <kborchers> nascro: that's just silly. what i gave you before should have worked
[08:48:50] <nascro> @kborchers: what is silly about it?
[08:49:01] <jeffsmykil> they dont like .parent.parent
[08:49:32] <jeffsmykil> when you can just search up the dom instead
[08:49:49] <jeffsmykil> its like saying my grandfathers father instead or great-grandfather
[08:49:59] <nascro> @jeffsmykil: what's a simpler solution in my instance?
[08:50:10] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil,  or my father's father's father
[08:50:26] <jeffsmykil> @nascro probably whatever @kborchers gave you
[08:50:36] <jeffsmykil> sadmicrowave: or that
[08:50:43] <sadmicrowave> nascro, $(this).closest('.foo:visible');
[08:50:49] <nascro> @kborchers: you're in Aurora? I'm in Peoria-area
[08:50:58] <kborchers> nascro: your html had foo as the class on one of those divs and bar on another so how does that work?
[08:51:09] <kborchers> nasc
[08:51:12] <kborchers> oops
[08:51:18] <skypce> hi guys, how can i do it ? $("form[action=/node/add/profile]").attr('node-form','profile-node-form');
[08:51:34] <kborchers> nascro yes i am working in that area and live in Naperville
[08:51:53] <sadmicrowave> skypce,  $("form[action='/node/add/profile']").attr('node-form','profile-node-form')
[08:51:58] <sadmicrowave> you were missing quotes
[08:52:02] <kborchers> nascro: show me your code again and we'll make it better.
[08:52:07] <nascro> @kborchers: see new code. only returns first two divs
[08:52:09] <nascro> http://pastie.org/2304357
[08:52:15] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: :visible won't work in his case because it doesn
[08:52:26] <sadmicrowave> oh, sorry, not versed on the details
[08:52:28] <kborchers> t check visibility
[08:52:28] <skypce> sadmicrowave, thank you
[08:52:41] <nascro> @kborchers: my folks live in Yorkville, just southeast of Aurora/Oswego. I'm up there all the time.
[08:52:59] <kborchers> nascro: i lived in Yorkville for 5 years before moving to Naperville
[08:53:15] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: i am still working on your issue ;)
[08:53:28] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, good, because I'm at a loss... :(
[08:53:34] <jeffsmykil> i dont suppose you can give xml nodes classes?
[08:53:35] <nascro> @kborchers: I lived in Yorkville in 2007 for about a year. Grand Reserve.
[08:53:52] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, why would you not be able to?
[08:54:02] <jeffsmykil> oh so you can?
[08:54:05] <jeffsmykil> very nice
[08:54:11] <sadmicrowave> ??i don't know..I'm asking you
[08:54:17] <TonyWanis> Hello
[08:54:35] <jeffsmykil> I dont know i just kind of assumed you couldnt
[08:54:42] <sadmicrowave> I've never done anything with xml but I'd assume they are treated like DOM elements, which means they can be referenced with jquery selectors....
[08:54:49] <nascro> @kborchers I always got the impression that Yorkville natives weren't too happy about Grand Reserve.
[08:55:08] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, $('myXMLnode').addClass('myAddedClass');
[08:55:34] <jeffsmykil> sadmicrowave:  yeah not what i meant ;)
[08:55:50] <jeffsmykil> I meant can you do like <xmlNode class="foo"></xml>
[08:56:07] <sadmicrowave> oh
[08:56:25] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, I live in texas, which is two states below Colorado, does that mean we have a bunch in common and we should spend time talking about it?
[08:56:34] <kborchers> nascro; var $n = $(this).closest('.foo'); if($n.css("visibility") == "visible") ....
[08:56:56] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: yes, i have relatives in Texas and have been to Colorado so let's chat ;)
[08:57:04] <sadmicrowave> YAY!
[08:57:18] <nascro> @kborchers: testing.
[08:57:22] <jeffsmykil> I live in NH which is nowhere near any of this, should we chat?
[08:57:46] <nascro> @kborchers: here's the actual implementation. Click on California, then the right arrow to see what the problem is. http://bit.ly/n9gubJ
[08:57:58] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: well i lived in NH for a year so you're in the club
[08:58:09] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: which part?
[08:58:17] <sadmicrowave> I've HEARD about NH...so I'm in the club too right?
[08:58:43] <jeffsmykil> what have you heard?
[08:58:56] <sadmicrowave> what NH stands for?
[08:58:58] <kborchers> northern. but i was only 2 years old then so couldn't tell you anything about it. my dad was stationed at a naval base up there
[08:59:38] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, I drank water bottled in colorado one time...I think that makes us relatives
[08:59:49] <kborchers> heh
[09:00:06] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: if you want me to look at your issue, we should stop the nonsense ;)
[09:00:13] <sadmicrowave> :P
[09:00:30] <sadmicrowave> what? you can't multitask?
[09:00:32] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: it was probably south west then
[09:00:35] <jeffsmykil> not much ocean up north
[09:00:41] <sadmicrowave> ?multitask @ kborchers
[09:00:42] <bot-t> kborchers, http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Photo/_new/pb-110520-catch-whalen.photoblog900.jpg
[09:00:57] <sadmicrowave> lmfao!
[09:01:39] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: doh, i think you're right. and we may have actually lived in Maine and he was stationed in NH, but not completely sure
[09:01:49] <jeffsmykil> yeah portsmouth then
[09:02:35] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: though not having ocean means nothing. he was stationed in Idaho for 6 months as well
[09:03:12] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: http://www.navsea.navy.mil/shipyards/portsmouth/default.aspx
[09:03:55] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: yep that looks right. he was a nuclear operator on a sub
[09:04:30] <jeffsmykil> glad we could figure that out!
[09:04:33] <jeffsmykil> i feel much better
[09:04:44] <kborchers> me too ;)
[09:04:49] * jeffsmykil nods
[09:04:51] <nascro> @kborchers: your solution returns all visible divs, not all divs with a style attribute including a visibility:visible; value.
[09:05:10] <nascro> @kborchers: this works, though: var $n = $(this).closest('.foo[style*="visibility: visible;"]');
[09:05:11] <MatthiasVance> So, I was typing up a test case on JSFiddle, but it would not even work in Firefox (which the original code does), could anyone please scan over the code to see if I got anything obvious wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/CTCHa/1/
[09:07:55] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to live detect when a new DOM object is created?
[09:08:26] <kborchers> nascro: hmmm, i didn't think .css would work the same is the :visible selector but maybe it does. my bad. i guess parsing style is the way, though i find that hard to believe. gotta be a cleaner way since if your style is visibility:visible; your test would fail since there isn't a space. just seems easily broken
[09:08:44] <daninma> I need some assistance with a form submit issue. - if the user picks a certain value in the form, on form submit they will get a modalbox asking if they want to be redirected to a site after submittal. the modalbox is being rpesented, btu the form also submits at the same time.
[09:08:53] <daninma> http://jsbin.com/ajocay/2/edit
[09:09:03] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: your issue is pissing me off
[09:09:13] <sadmicrowave> I know right!
[09:09:44] <daninma> I havent been able to figure out how to make ti wait for a returned value from the user
[09:10:01] <nascro> @kborchers: fortunately, visibility: visible; is being applied programmatically, so it only has to be right in two places.
[09:10:35] <jeffsmykil> daninma there is a ay to prevent the default value of a button
[09:10:52] <jeffsmykil> http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[09:10:58] <jeffsmykil> but im not sure that will do it for you
[09:11:07] <daninma> nope. not in this case'
[09:11:56] <skypce> how can i change the id of a html element?
[09:12:28] <jeffsmykil> .attr("id") = "foo"
[09:12:30] <jeffsmykil> maybe
[09:12:36] <jeffsmykil> that doesn't seem right though
[09:12:58] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: that is right
[09:13:03] <skypce> ok thank you jeffsebring
[09:13:11] <phlp> .attr('id', 'foo')
[09:13:15] <daninma> or attr('id','foo')
[09:13:23] <jeffsmykil> that looks right
[09:13:30] <daninma> yeah ;)
[09:13:33] <kborchers> damnit, not thinking phlp is correct
[09:13:42] <skypce> thank you :D
[09:13:50] <jeffsmykil> in my experience phlp is always right
[09:14:55] <nascro> My mind hurts
[09:15:36] <nascro> @kborchers I assume you feel the same about Grand Reserve
[09:16:38] <Fox`> can anyone explain why opera offsets these slides? http://matmarquis.com/carousel/
[09:16:54] <Fox`> if you click next you'll see the slides get more and more offsetted
[09:17:03] <kborchers> nascro: i could care less. i didn't really get involved much with anything in Yorkville. Left that town whenever I could and moved as soon as I could. Only lived there cuz that's what we could afford at the time
[09:17:32] <kborchers> All i knew of grand reserve was what I could see from 34 as I drove past headed toward civilization ;)
[09:17:52] <MatthiasVance> I'll try to explain it shorter: When I use a selector to select an element with an "unknown" attribute, it does not work on ie7 and ie8.
[09:18:10] <nascro> @kborchers: Haha, yeah, there's not much in Yorkville. It was once slated as "The Next Naperville" but something tells me it didn't work out.
[09:18:13] <MatthiasVance> (using .closest(), also tried .parents(), using .parents().attr("unknown") as a workaround now)
[09:19:19] <Fox`> no1 no?
[09:21:21] <phlp> MatthiasVance: are you trying to get the value of unknown or select an element that has the attribute? .attr returns the value of the attribute
[09:21:47] <MatthiasVance> The latter, selecting an element that has the attribute.
[09:21:57] <MatthiasVance> I linked a jsfiddle a "few lines back"
[09:22:24] <phlp> $('div[unknown]')
[09:22:39] <nascro> @kborchers what do you do in Naperville?
[09:23:29] <MatthiasVance> phlp: Well no I want to known if there are parents with said attribute
[09:23:37] <MatthiasVance> And they can be of any tag
[09:23:42] <MatthiasVance> *-of
[09:24:15] <phlp> .closest('[unknown]').length
[09:24:55] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: probably not exactly what you want but maybe get you closer http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/2MTxB/3/
[09:25:03] <MatthiasVance> That is what I've been using, and it does not work on IE7 and IE8. @ ph8
[09:25:10] <MatthiasVance> ^ phlp
[09:25:25] <kborchers> nascro: what do you mean? my job?
[09:25:30] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, I'm pretty sure thats exactly what I'm looking for
[09:25:39] <nascro> @kborchers yep
[09:25:46] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, and all you did was put it in a callback of the fadeIn...clever bastard
[09:26:00] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: had to mess with the css as well. look at positioning
[09:26:03] <[E]sc> i have 2 different jquery's i've downloaded off the net.  One is a drop down menu, and the other a textarea auto expander,  they work fine on their own, but when i combine the two, the text expander doesn't expand, is there any way to find out what's going on there?
[09:26:15] <nascro> @kborchers: My first job as a web designer was in Geneva. Commuted from Yorkville for a year.
[09:26:54] <kborchers> nascro: i'm a web developer and then do freelance webdev on the side. basically i work all the time ;)
[09:27:09] <phlp> MatthiasVance: works for me in ie8 http://jsfiddle.net/Kut8m
[09:27:13] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, much appreciated
[09:27:18] <kborchers> np
[09:28:27] <MatthiasVance> phlp: This is what I meant: http://jsfiddle.net/Kut8m/1/
[09:28:31] <MatthiasVance> So, without a value.
[09:29:49] <phlp> MatthiasVance: http://jsfiddle.net/Kut8m/2
[09:30:52] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, added a 'pulse' functionality on icon click..check it out: http://jsfiddle.net/2MTxB/4/
[09:31:34] <MatthiasVance> Thank you, that worked! Why does it fail with the selector you are *supposed* to use then?
[09:31:37] <Putr> is it just me or is it impossible to bind and event twice for the same element?
[09:31:59] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: looks good though be careful once it's in your page as it looks like that "explode" animation jumps to top: 0px when you animate it
[09:32:10] <Putr> (a 3rd party lib puts events on all input fields. And now i cant put any of my own events on)
[09:32:12] <ShawnRisk> how come this code: var $content = $('> .fieldset-wrapper', fieldset).hide(); doesn't work on this page: http://friendsofglendon.ca/sites/FoG/contact-us full code: http://friendsofglendon.ca/sites/FoG/misc/collapse.js  All I want is for the fieldsets to open and close, and then if I have one is open and another opens the first one closes.
[09:33:10] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, ahh, see what you mean
[09:33:53] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, http://jsfiddle.net/2MTxB/5/ fixed
[09:34:21] <sadmicrowave> crap - http://jsfiddle.net/2MTxB/7/
[09:34:44] <sadmicrowave> did you fork it?
[09:34:49] <sadmicrowave> on revision 6?
[09:35:04] <jeffsmykil> fork it? he barely new it!
[09:35:07] * jeffsmykil ducks
[09:35:15] <nascro> @kborchers: What kind of web development do you do most? Specialization? Send me your freelance information, I may contact you if you're interested.
[09:35:31] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, 'fork' not 'pork'
[09:35:44] <phlp> MatthiasVance: i think it only fails in older IEs so i blame it on that. dont know why the workaround works
[09:36:26] <MatthiasVance> I guess it's time to file a bug then.
[09:36:53] <jeffsmykil> and a = sign just cost me an hour
[09:37:33] <jberglund1> Wouldn't be the first time something fails in IE...
[09:37:40] <ShawnRisk> any ideas with my problem?
[09:37:45] <grobin> hey all, I've got a quick question about scope and jQuery plugins
[09:37:49] <phlp> MatthiasVance: there may be a bug for it. ive seen discussion about it in the past
[09:37:49] <grobin> i'm writing my first one!
[09:38:01] <grobin> i have a couple of variables that are basically global variables
[09:38:05] <MatthiasVance> Yeah I'm searching for it first.
[09:38:12] <grobin> i want every method to access to the same values for these variables
[09:38:44] <grobin> i defined them at the top of the $.fn section inside the parent closure, but it seems like they don't carry their values out of the scope of the inner functions that modify them
[09:38:49] <grobin> here's the code:
[09:38:58] <ajpiano> grobin: you can create "static members" by putting them inside of the closure
[09:38:58] <MatthiasVance> phlp: This might be it: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7770
[09:39:29] <grobin> http://dpaste.com/583670/
[09:39:30] <jeffsmykil> for my next trick i will unsucesfully navigate the dom
[09:39:34] <grobin> "static members"?
[09:39:44] <ajpiano> grobin: (function($) { var SOMETHING_CONSTANT = 'WHATEVER";   return this.each(function() { });    })(jQuery);
[09:40:03] <jeffsmykil> sounds like a great band name
[09:40:04] <grobin> yeah, that's what I have basically!
[09:40:06] <jeffsmykil> "static members"
[09:40:08] <ajpiano> wow my code example was #fail
[09:40:17] <grobin> @jeff haha yeah
[09:40:19] <ajpiano> grobin: no it isn't
[09:40:32] <ajpiano> grobin: (function($) { var SOMETHING_CONSTANT = 'WHATEVER";   $.fn.foo = function() { return this.each(function() { }); };   })(jQuery);
[09:40:39] <grobin> ah yes
[09:40:43] <ajpiano> that's what you should have ^^ what you have is
[09:40:48] <ajpiano> well, you know what you have :)
[09:40:54] <ajpiano> the vars get redefined on every function invocation
[09:41:38] <grobin> yes, ok, so I had tried that before
[09:41:41] <grobin> it still did not work
[09:41:54] <ajpiano> well it certainly *does* work
[09:42:16] <grobin> there must be something else I'm doing wrong
[09:42:24] <grobin> thanks for your input ajpiano

[09:58:00] <axiak> Hey I had a question regardding attr/prop
[09:58:09] <axiak> which function should I use for something like "abbr" ?
[09:58:22] <sadmicrowave> .attr()
[09:58:38] <axiak> okay, is prop then only for javascript-esque properties?
[09:58:46] <ajpiano> yes,
[09:58:53] <ajpiano> it's for properties of DOMElements
[09:58:59] <sadmicrowave> prop is better for ( enabled, disabled, checked, selected, etc)
[09:59:14] <axiak> so on this page
[09:59:15] <axiak> http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/12/jquery-1-6-1-released/
[09:59:17] <axiak> there's a table
[09:59:28] <axiak> is it safe to say that the .prop() list is pretty much exhaustive?
[09:59:35] <axiak> and things not found are generally html attributes?
[09:59:46] <axiak> (and thus use .attr())
[09:59:53] <ajpiano> i wouldn't necessarily say that
[10:00:12] <axiak> i have a huge code base to grep for potential backwards incompatibilities :)
[10:00:46] <axiak> I have 540 usages of .attr that I need to pare down
[10:01:00] <ajpiano> most of them should degrade ok as of 1.6.2
[10:01:08] <axiak> yes, but I need to make sure
[10:01:27] <axiak> do data- attributes still work in 1.6.2 ?
[10:01:32] <ajpiano> yes
[10:01:38] <axiak> good
[10:02:21] <kborchers> ajpiano: LOL "Getting Ript With JavaScript" that is awesome.
[10:04:06] <ajpiano> :D
[10:08:50] <jedimind> <axiak> do data- attributes still work in 1.6.2 ?
[10:08:53] <jedimind> why wouldnt they?
[10:12:27] <Flower21> Someone have a good plugin to suggest me . I tried to change one that already exist that could stop and start the scrolling on mouse hover
[10:12:52] <smplstk> simplstk
[10:12:57] <Flower21> it works fine : http://tinyurl.com/3sx22hh
[10:12:57] <zoned> i have a nested selector.each(function()) {, will my $(this) variable change depending which .each(function()){ i am inside?
[10:13:01] <Flower21> but i cant make it to stop
[10:13:07] <smplstk> woops, lol
[10:13:40] <Flower21> kborchers are you here ?
[10:13:50] <kborchers[A]> Flower21: yes
[10:13:56] <Flower21> i tried your code but i think the plugin is broken or somethin
[10:14:04] <Flower21> the stopAutoScroll dont seem to work
[10:14:19] <zoned> kborchers: you always have the answers to my simple questions :P
[10:14:57] <kborchers> can you show me where you tried my code. that example you gave won't stop because the stopAutoScroll() is being called outside your window.load and thus it happens before the dom is ready.
[10:15:03] <Flower21> you can go to this url to see what im talking about, you'll see that theres something wrong
[10:15:03] <kborchers> Flower21 ^^^
[10:15:09] <Flower21> sure
[10:15:44] <Flower21> http://jsfiddle.net/fSnHC/1/
[10:16:23] <kborchers> Flower21: shoot,that's my fault move that var inside the window.load
[10:17:22] <Flower21> thanks ! but why the scrolling stop from  working ?
[10:18:00] <kborchers> you move that var inside and it should work. do you have a link to the broken version?
[10:19:04] <Flower21> http://tinyurl.com/3sx22hh
[10:19:11] <Flower21> you'll se that it stopped from working
[10:19:38] <kborchers> Flower21: that is the link from earlier
[10:19:45] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: you see something glaring about this line?
[10:19:45] <jeffsmykil> $(xml).find("#" + whichFacility "." + whichView + "." + whichFloor).each(function() {
[10:20:40] <Flower21> maybe a space ?
[10:20:50] <Flower21> $(xml).find("#" + whichFacility " ." + whichView + " ." + whichFloor).each(function() {
[10:20:56] <Flower21> i dunno xD
[10:21:13] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: are you actually trying to parse xml with that or is it just a var name?
[10:21:24] <jeffsmykil> trying to parse with that
[10:21:30] <jeffsmykil> there are variavles of course
[10:22:48] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: hmmm, you have classes in your xml? whichView and whichFloor are classes right? i think i'm confused. you have a link to your code?
[10:23:06] <jeffsmykil> kborchers what should i use instead of classes?
[10:23:08] <jeffsmykil> they cant be IDs
[10:23:12] <jeffsmykil> they aren't unique
[10:24:05] <Flower21> kborchers : there was missing a });
[10:24:12] <Flower21> but the stop still dosnt work :\
[10:24:37] <jeffsmykil> should i jusst use attrobutes?
[10:27:18] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: i have never seen classes in XML. see ?p
[10:27:18] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:27:39] <kanzie> so am I current to assume that I can change my server-code that today just gives plain xml, to instead take what I send as ?callback=jquery3234 and return the xml inside a jquery3234('<myxml>'); statement?
[10:27:44] <kanzie> to use jsonp
[10:28:04] <ajpiano> kanzie: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh no
[10:28:05] <kborchers> Flower21: again, please give me a link to the example with my code in it so i can see it not work
[10:28:07] <jeffsmykil> kborchers if i changed all the classes to diff attribute what would be the correct syntax?
[10:28:21] <ajpiano> jsonp revolves around returning json, wrapped with "padding" (parens)
[10:28:31] <kanzie> ajpiano: sounded to easy :-)
[10:29:02] <Flower21> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/fSnHC/2/
[10:29:09] <kanzie> ajpiano: yeah, but from what I have been able to deduce from stackoverflow-conversations I could ride on the padding to get my xml across
[10:29:30] <kanzie> ajpiano: Im having problems with my proxy-solution and wish to leverage from jsonp instead
[10:29:34] <ajpiano> kanzie: you'd have to return something like ( {"xml": "<xmlstring>"} )
[10:29:36] <Flower21> i've changed a few things, the script works now, but the hover dosnt :\
[10:29:54] <kborchers> Flower21: no, i want the the page that shows the hover not working. i know what my code looks like
[10:30:11] <kanzie> ajpiano: aaah, thanksâ¦ but Im correct about lending the jquery-assigned callback, then I can use the normal success:-statement in the .ajax()-call?
[10:30:22] <ajpiano> no you aren't
[10:30:31] <ajpiano> you just use ajax like normal, you don't do jQuery134234561()
[10:30:37] <ajpiano> and you use jQuery like normal as well
[10:30:46] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: it would really help to see more of your code. what you are trying to parse and the code doing the parsing
[10:30:47] <kanzie> ajpiano: mono, I got that. Sorry for being unclear
[10:30:51] <ajpiano> the 234231416 is just a randomly generated callback name to make jsonp work
[10:30:52] <ajpiano> ok
[10:30:59] <kanzie> ajpiano: the .ajax()-call assigns a random callback-name
[10:31:02] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: i understand
[10:31:14] <kanzie> so as long as the server uses this callback-handle as padding Im good
[10:31:22] <ajpiano> yea
[10:31:44] <kanzie> ajpiano: sweet, Ill try that. But using this mean I won't be able to use the error:-clause in .ajax?
[10:31:48] <Flower21> kborchers : i've found why it wasnt working , there was missing a });
[10:32:07] <Flower21> but the code dosnt work
[10:32:17] <Flower21> im starting to thing that the stopAutoScroll function
[10:32:21] <Flower21> think*
[10:32:32] <ajpiano> kanzie: that is correct.  jsonp isn't actually "ajax" and there isn't a non-browser-sniffing solution to providing a cross browser error callback on jsonp requests.  in order to get one, use the see ?g jquery-jsonp googlecode
[10:32:33] <bot-t> kanzie, jquery-jsonp - JSONP for jQuery - Google Project Hosting - Google Code - http://code.google.com/p/jquery-jsonp/
[10:33:49] <kborchers> Flower21: i want to see this page http://dev.test.biosphereinteractif.com/test/ with my code in it. can i make that any clearer?
[10:34:27] <kanzie> ajpiano: sweet, just what I needed
[10:34:46] <Flower21> kborchers : yes , its there
[10:34:55] <kborchers> no it isn't
[10:34:56] <Flower21> i just added the closure at the end of code
[10:35:08] <kborchers> now it is
[10:35:18] <Flower21> line 25
[10:36:17] <kanzie> ajpiano: just to be clear, if the server receives ?callback=jquery474383 it should respond jquery474383( {"xml": "<xmlstring>"} );
[10:36:25] <kborchers> Flower21: that is still missing the }); please add that so i can see it working
[10:36:27] <ajpiano> pretty much yeah
[10:37:03] <kanzie> and if I have a method that I want to run for success I could just as well override the automatically assigned callback and add that ?
[10:38:20] <ScriptWorkz> Anyone know why Jquery UI's Dialog won't just won't open in ie
[10:38:39] <ajpiano> kanzie: uh.. the magically assigned callback is what runs and triggers your "success" handler
[10:38:44] <ScriptWorkz> i've used dialog a million times and on this latest project, seems like no matter what i do it just won't open in ie using dialog('open')
[10:38:55] <kanzie> ajpiano: ok
[10:39:08] <Flower21> kborchers : its back there
[10:39:10] <ScriptWorkz> if i leave autoOpen set to true and just intiialize it, it seems to show but looks a little a jacked up
[10:39:33] <kanzie> ajpiano: I was just thinkng since I can override it, it would only seem relevant if I could write my own success-handler.
[10:41:03] <ScriptWorkz> anyone?
[10:41:21] <Xeon06_> Does anyone see a valid reason why this could return false? var success = $('#overlay').hide().is(":hidden");
[10:41:58] <ScriptWorkz> at this point, willing to pay for answers, just gotta get it working like yesterday
[10:42:32] <Ogredude> I'm using an autocomplete handler on a textfield.  What I'm looking for now is a way for the code to tell that the user has NOT selected any autocomplete option, so I can fire up some script to expose some extra fields
[10:42:35] <kborchers> Flower21: try this http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/fSnHC/3/
[10:43:15] <Ogredude> I could probably tap the blur event
[10:43:38] <Ogredude> but is that going to behave differently depending on whether the user selected one of the autocomplete options?
[10:44:00] <misterm__> Xeon06_: does the element get hidden?
[10:44:15] <Xeon06_> misterm_: No
[10:45:03] <Xeon06_> I'm thinking it's probably a race condition with the page loading or something like that
[10:45:11] <misterm__> Xeon06_: $('#overlay') is not what you think it is then
[10:45:35] <ScriptWorkz> ne one have ideas on why these dialogs won't open at all in ie?
[10:45:39] <Xeon06_> misterm_: It's pretty plain, <div id="overlay">
[10:46:27] <Ogredude> also I can't find any relevant documentation on autocomplete's _renderItem
[10:46:31] <misterm__> Xeon06_: no, what I mean is at that particular line of code, $('#overlay') is not what you think it is
[10:46:55] <misterm__> Xeon06_: you expect it to return a jQuery object containing that element...but clearly that is not happening
[10:47:31] <Xeon06_> misterm_: Ok so it's some kind of race condition in the loading of the page, because it doesn't always happen. I'll just have to find a way to detect when it has been loaded
[10:47:51] <misterm__> Xeon06_: How is that div created?
[10:48:02] <Xeon06_> misterm_: jQuery template
[10:48:06] <ScriptWorkz> what's wierd is if i do modal: true the overlay shows but the dialog doesn't
[10:48:40] <Xeon06_> misterm_: It's a complex usage of jquery template which I'm not the author of. I wish there was an even onTemplateLoaded or something
[10:52:07] <Ogredude> also, I think my IRC client is broken
[10:52:30] <ajpiano> Ogredude: do you have any idea of how to approach determining whether the choice was autocompleted?
[10:53:10] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  I have no clue
[10:53:17] <g0bl1n> using $('#myform').submit() will not return the server answer, right ? If one needs an answer must use an ajax call with Post ?
[10:53:39] <Ogredude> once I've got a way to determine whether or not an autocomplete was selected, I'll be back on the path
[10:54:01] <ajpiano> Ogredude, are you using the source: funciton() or a url string or array for the source: optoin
[10:54:27] <Ogredude> I found the documentation for _renderItem, it's going to take a bit to get used to how JQuery documentation is laid out.  I don't expect documentation to exist only in the demos.
[10:54:34] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  source: function()
[10:54:48] <ajpiano> Ogredude: what i would do to figure that out is use a "change" handler on the actual input itself
[10:55:06] <ajpiano> and save a reference to the current list of choices inside of the source functoin
[10:55:24] <ajpiano> and then do an $.inArray of those choices with the current value inside of the change handler
[10:55:33] <ajpiano> _renderItem is kind of a not-documented method
[10:55:55] <ajpiano> it's a bit of a tricky method for us to document cause it's a useful thing for developers to have access to but it doesn't work like any other method in jQuery UI
[10:56:05] <Ogredude> that makes sense.
[10:56:06] <ajpiano> so it happens to only be doc'd in the demo for now
[10:57:32] <Ogredude> so a .change event only fires when the element loses focus?
[10:58:01] <ajpiano> in some browsers
[10:58:02] <ajpiano> :/
[10:58:05] <Ogredude> ugh
[10:58:08] <ajpiano> technically that is how it supposed to work though
[10:58:09] <Ogredude> Chrome is one, then.
[10:58:11] <Ogredude> ok
[10:58:17] <ajpiano> blur would also work
[10:58:43] <Ogredude> well actually, in this case it works out
[10:58:48] <ScriptWorkz> looks like it is curvycorners that caused my problem w/ dialog, anyone know of a replacement for curvycorners that plays nice w/ jquery ui?
[10:58:59] <Ogredude> I can fire something on change or blur and it'll be adequate
[10:59:12] <nascro> Okay, who can I pay to fix my jQuery problem?
[10:59:13] <nascro> :)
[10:59:16] <nascro> . net
[10:59:36] <ScriptWorkz> nascro, i tried offering cash a few mins ago, no one seemed interested
[10:59:39] <ScriptWorkz> what's your problem?
[10:59:50] <opie_> make a donation to the jquery project
[11:00:04] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  okay, how about this?  I set a variable "completed" to False, then I set up the autocomplete.  In the select handler on the autocomplete, I change the value to True.  Then my blur handler can look at that variable and see whether the user autocompleted.  Is that feasible?>
[11:00:26] <ajpiano> Ogredude: i wouldn't recommend that, i'd recommend the approach i described earlier
[11:00:28] <Ogredude> also, I think I really need a crash cource in javascript syntax.  Not really sure what I'm doing with variable scope, etc
[11:00:34] <nascro> ScriptWorkz: see: http://bit.ly/n9gubJ
[11:00:49] <nascro> Click on California, then the right arrow
[11:00:51] <nascro> That's the problem.
[11:01:25] <opie_> nascro: you have 3 click handlers registered on that button
[11:01:45] <Ogredude> my worry is that I'm trying to allow duplicate company names.  So "Joe-BobCo" can exist in both Iowa and California, and if the California site's already signed up, it's going to be in the autocomplete list.  But the user needs to be able to bypass the autocomplete and put in a new entry for "Joe-BobCo" in Iowa.
[11:02:13] <ajpiano> hm
[11:02:24] <Ogredude> If I understand what you're advising, the $.inArray is going to match "Joe-BobCo" without paying attention that it's not the same one as in the autocomplete list
[11:02:26] <nascro> @opie_: I am using $(.projects').each();
[11:02:51] <nascro> @opie_: What I'd like to do is work with only the .projects that's visible in the modal
[11:02:52] <ajpiano> that is true, but i wouldn't have necessarily advised it that way had i known of that requirement
[11:02:57] <kborchers> nascro: you got your code handy still. have another idea
[11:03:00] <Ogredude> basically if there's no autocomplete chosen, I don't really give a damn what was in the choice list.  I just need it to expose the Department fields to build a new department in the new company.
[11:03:21] <Ogredude> I can share the flowchart if it helps, ajpiano
[11:03:28] <ajpiano> Ogredude, at that point you might want to start sending back {"name": "JoeBob", state: "CA"} and then you can prsent only the JoeBob in the autocomplete list but do some checking, etc, to see which state they selected
[11:03:30] <ScriptWorkz> so anyone know of a replacement for curvycorners that plays nice w/ ie and dialog?
[11:03:39] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/z0VAPvv3
[11:03:42] <ajpiano> ?g jquery corner plugin @ ScriptWorkz
[11:03:43] <bot-t> ScriptWorkz, JQuery Corner Demo - jQuery Plugins by malsup - http://jquery.malsup.com/corner/
[11:03:51] <Sean-Der> My code works wonderfully in FireFox, but fails in IE
[11:03:55] <ajpiano> Ogredude: nah.... i don't really want to start getting into app requirements
[11:04:05] <Sean-Der> Is this an issue of poor coding and FireFox is forgiving or IE is just a POS
[11:04:30] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  well the _renderItem renders the city & state under the company name, for the user's benefit.
[11:04:31] <nascro> @kborchers: here's the production js: http://pastie.org/2304949
[11:04:38] <ScriptWorkz> thx, will give it a shot
[11:04:39] <jstout> is there a way i can show just a loading image until the dom is fully loaded?
[11:04:52] <nascro> @kborchers: HTML here: http://bit.ly/n9gubJ
[11:04:58] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  why do you advise against setting a variable True on select?
[11:05:03] <ajpiano> Ogredude: so you already have access to the various information you're returning via json... how do you know what state they're looking for companies in
[11:05:05] <jstout> nvm that's easy
[11:05:19] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  the autocomplete is searching companies by name.
[11:05:29] <ajpiano> Ogredude, cause at that point you're writing the code around checking for a particular user interaction rather than data integritiy
[11:05:39] <ajpiano> which strikes me as brittle
[11:05:47] <Ogredude> good point.
[11:05:55] <ajpiano> Ogredude, but you're returning a list of companies with name, ctiy and state
[11:05:57] <xid> load(url+' body') doesn't get any content... why is that?
[11:06:05] <xid> load(url+' table') works fine
[11:06:17] <ajpiano> right ?
[11:06:25] <Ogredude> right
[11:06:37] <nascro> @kborchers: Maybe the .each() method is the problem?
[11:07:40] <ajpiano> hmm
[11:07:41] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  basically here's the flow.  If the user selects an autocomplete, then we're dealing with an existing company record and its existing department record(s).  If the user does not select the autocomplete, then we're building a new company record and a new department record.
[11:08:10] <ajpiano> Ogredude: i  might at this point consider actually addig some processing to your source: function() { }
[11:08:12] <Ogredude> there's also an autocomplete option "None of these" which will end up doing the same as not selecting an autocomplete.
[11:08:19] <ajpiano> where you add an option to the autocomplete list to create the new company
[11:08:40] <Ogredude> Force the user to select from the autocomplete?
[11:08:58] <Ogredude> I could do that, I suppose
[11:09:10] <ajpiano> i don't think it would necessarily force them to
[11:09:27] <ajpiano> it would just make it so that they could choose to do the new company creation by having selected from the autocomplete
[11:09:39] <Ogredude> oh, okay.  Already got that.
[11:09:45] <Ogredude> yeah that part's no problem.
[11:10:12] <ScriptWorkz> thin kthat corners plugin is gonna work for me, thtanks again ajpiano
[11:10:18] <Ogredude> where I'm running into the problem is when the user doesn't choose to select "new company" or "none of these" or whatever it happens to be labelled this moment, but just wants to keep filling out the form.
[11:10:55] <ajpiano> hum
[11:11:01] <Ogredude> whether we're autocompleting on the "new company" option or not autocompleting at all, either way we're now building a new company record with a new department record.
[11:11:06] <ajpiano> i would probably just let them fill out the form and then validate the data on the server
[11:11:21] <Ogredude> server side validation is already taken care of
[11:11:23] <ajpiano> to make sure it isn't actually a dupe
[11:11:24] <opie_> nascro: can you use a delegate for all prev/next arrows to advance the content
[11:11:31] <kborchers> nascro: it's a combination of your $(".projects").each(function() { and your $("a.next").click(function () { your binding every next link for every .project found so change $("a.next").click(function () { to $(this).find("a.next").click(function () { and see if that helps
[11:11:31] <Ogredude> yeah that's already handled.
[11:11:37] <Ogredude> I'm looking for the user experience at the moment.
[11:11:39] <ajpiano> so then what in blazes are you asking
[11:11:44] <opie_> ?delegate nascro
[11:11:45] <bot-t> opie_, Couldn't find "delegate nascro" in jQuery Docs.
[11:11:51] <Ogredude> this is all frontend stuff, and I'm no good at this stuff.
[11:11:53] <opie_> ?delegate @ nascro
[11:11:53] <bot-t> nascro, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[11:12:11] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  I am asking, how can I tell when the user does NOT choose an autocomplete option at all?
[11:12:38] <Ogredude> That's really the only thing I need, I've got all the other stuff pretty much figured out.
[11:13:05] <Nitrxgen__> http://dev.nitrxgen.net/screenshot-3.png - has anyone good a good suggestion for this kind of slideshow? title & description, preferably modal too
[11:13:07] <ajpiano> well, you could try the approach you mentioned of using a flag as the events happen i guess
[11:13:18] <ajpiano> Ogredude, or you could just always show the form on every blur and then just optionally populate it
[11:13:20] <opie_> wire up a delegate to the correct selector and that should eliminate your duplicate handlers additionally it will support all modals with a single handler, so you can add new states modals without any more js code
[11:13:21] <Ogredude> You advised against that method. For what reasons?
[11:13:33] <ajpiano> for the reason i described
[11:13:49] <ajpiano> but since your other ducks are in a row it might be viable in this case
[11:13:51] <Ogredude> ah, because it's testing for user interaction
[11:14:30] <Ogredude> yeah at this point, everything on the Rails end is wired up to accept and validate the incoming data.  Right now, I'm looking strictly at the user interaction of the thing.
[11:14:36] <Ogredude> so I guess the flag would be okay
[11:15:17] <ajpiano> so what happens, everytime the autocomplete closes you .... show? create? populate? a form
[11:15:34] <nascro> @kborchers @opie_: Thanks again for looking at this. Testing...
[11:15:34] <Ogredude> pretty much
[11:15:44] <ajpiano> Ogredude, which one of those three things :p
[11:15:50] <ajpiano> slash combination
[11:15:50] <Ogredude> ah.
[11:16:00] <Ogredude> currently, it'll show the form
[11:16:10] <ajpiano> yea that's what i'm saying
[11:16:17] <ajpiano> why not just always show the form
[11:16:25] <ajpiano> and then just conditionally POPULATE it based on if they selected something
[11:16:33] <ajpiano> otherwise just allow them to fill the form and treat it as a new entry
[11:16:52] <Ogredude> focus group shows that's not an ideal interaction for our target audience.
[11:17:02] <Ogredude> that was my first thought
[11:17:10] <ajpiano> uhhhh
[11:17:25] <ajpiano> so the target interaction is instead to do what........
[11:17:26] <Ogredude> so now, I've got it wired up so if they select a company from autocomplete, it exposes a "Department" select box, populated with that company's departments.
[11:17:47] <Ogredude> If they choose the "new company" autocomplete option, it exposes a set of Department fields, for name, address, phone, etc.
[11:18:08] <Ogredude> and now I'm looking for the third piece of the interaction puzzle, where the user types stuff in the autocomplete form and does NOT select an autocomplete option.
[11:18:21] <Ogredude> which is basically going to do the exact same thing as selecting "new company"
[11:18:22] <ajpiano> Ogredude, don't take this the wrong way, but i totally feel like if companies are focus-grouping their frontends, they also have the money to actually hire people who are frontend devs :p
[11:18:55] <Ogredude> more of an informal focus group. We showed the thing to a number of people in our target audience and collected their reactions.
[11:19:26] <Ogredude> these are not computer-savvy people we're dealing with, on a whole.  The UI needs to handhold a lot
[11:19:29] <ajpiano> i'm sure someof them would prefer an interface where you just read their mind and send a knowledgable teenager over to type into the fields for them
[11:19:32] <Flower21> kborchers : thanks a lot for your help and patience, but it still dosnt work :Â°(
[11:19:39] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  I agree.
[11:19:56] <Ogredude> but since that's not a possibility, it comes down to doing the best we can with what we've got
[11:20:17] <draginx> Is there a way to listen to all ajax calls and if the dataType is json?
[11:20:54] <kborchers> Flower21: what does it do when you make that change?
[11:21:13] <ajpiano> Ogredude if the idea here is to certainly ensure a particular interaction then yeah, i guess i'd go with the interaction based approach
[11:21:17] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  and what's the big deal about focus groups, anyway?  You get a bunch of people in the room, show them something, and collect their comments.  Not really a high-end process.
[11:21:18] <misterm__> draginx: can you clarify what you are trying to do a bit?
[11:21:19] <Flower21> no change , the scroll is working
[11:21:27] <ajpiano> just beware that trying to force people through an interaction can be very frustrating if they end up NOT wanting their hand held
[11:21:30] <draginx> misterm_: basically I'm working in a client's library
[11:21:32] <Flower21> but the hovering function dont work
[11:21:34] <draginx> he has a bunch of ajax calls everywhere
[11:21:40] <draginx> I want to create a global command called "trigger"
[11:22:03] <draginx> so if there's json data {trigger: ["command","command2","lala"]} then I want to execute the script
[11:22:07] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  that's why this particular piece of the interaction.  If I could force handholding, I'd already be done.  "You're required to select something from the autocomplete. Period."
[11:22:21] <draginx> "ajazComplete"
[11:22:22] <ajpiano> Ogredude: it just seems emblematic of an organisation that would actually hire people who were experts at the thing you're getting feedback on developing :p
[11:22:26] <draginx> i guess I can do that
[11:22:27] <kborchers> Flower21: not sure what you mean.
[11:22:37] <misterm__> draginx: you mean if any of those responses return that?
[11:22:44] <draginx> yeah
[11:22:49] <draginx> *any* ajax response
[11:22:49] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  yeah, we're early in our lifecycle.  Give us a year or so, we'll have UX experts.  And I won't be doing the coding.
[11:22:58] <draginx> of course as long as global: true (which they will be)
[11:23:06] <ajpiano> Ogredude: as long as it moves between the "states" you should be ok
[11:23:10] <Ogredude> I am totally not qualified for this job.  I've got enough skill to pull off this particular project, but this is not my Thing.
[11:23:22] <Flower21> kborchers : the scroll still works, no change there
[11:23:30] <ajpiano> cause you don't want to assume that someone "hasn't picked something from the autocomplete" when in reality they "made a typo and want to type into the field again"
[11:23:32] <draginx> $(document).bind("ajaxComplete", function(data) { .. need to check if data is json? }
[11:23:38] <Flower21> kborchers : but when i hover an image with my mouse, the scroll continue, it wont stop
[11:23:41] <funous> hi, is there a jquery UI plugin to create selectbox with each option styled differently? (eg. font-size and font-family choosing with preview)
[11:23:48] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  and thanks for all the help and discussion on this, it's really helped clear a bunch of things up for me.
[11:24:03] <ajpiano> you're welcome Ogredude :)
[11:24:06] <draginx> since not all data will be json is there an easy to see if it is in json? O-o
[11:24:10] <ajpiano> hope you don't mind my frankness
[11:24:19] <Flower21> kborchers : i tried with an alert in the function
[11:24:20] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  well if they made a typo and want to type into the field again, it's going to start the autocompleting again.  That part already works fine.
[11:24:35] <ajpiano> Ogredude, yea that's all i wanted to check that it'll revert properly if they go back
[11:24:37] <Ogredude> selecting "new company" shuts off the autocompleter
[11:24:37] <Flower21> and it worked
[11:24:46] <Flower21> ( the alert worked )...
[11:24:46] <ajpiano> well isn't that bad then?
[11:24:48] <Ogredude> but otherwise, everything that way's already wired up good
[11:25:01] <ajpiano> if they accidentally get thrown into "new company" mode but they didnt' actually want to be there and can't autocomplete anymore?
[11:25:26] <Ogredude> it is, but it's acceptable, given the cost of doing something different with it.  I have to fight for every single line of javascript, it's very uncomfortable for me.
[11:25:35] <Flower21> kborchers : the problem is the script .. that function dont owrk :\ stopAutoScroll
[11:25:41] <Ogredude> if you hit new company and didn't mean it, you can damn well hit the sign up link again.
[11:26:03] <ajpiano> Ogredude fight with it, or fight *for* it to prove that it's supposed to be there ?
[11:26:17] <Ogredude> fight with it
[11:26:22] <ajpiano> Ogredude that would end up being far more painful and pretty much reverse all the handholding you're doing, imo
[11:26:24] <Ogredude> javascript and I are not friendly yet
[11:26:39] <ajpiano> Ogredude, has anyone directed you to see ?101
[11:26:39] <bot-t> Ogredude, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[11:26:42] <ajpiano> yet?
[11:27:08] <Ogredude> negative. But that looks like exactly the sort of quick rundown of Javascript syntax that I need.
[11:27:19] <ajpiano> wooo, ok, good
[11:27:24] <Ogredude> I know (more or less) how to Program.  I just don't know how to Program In Javascript
[11:30:04] <Ogredude> oh good, and I just discovered the JavaScript Koans
[11:30:08] <Ogredude> that'll be helpful too
[11:31:50] <Ogredude> One extends one's limits only by exceeding them.
[11:32:21] <kborchers> Flower21: change scrollable.hover( to $(".scrollableArea").hover( on line 36 and see if that helps
[11:33:17] <ajpiano> hehe, i believe you mean that one $.extend( self.limits, availableKnowledge)
[11:33:45] <Ogredude> Exceeds limits error! availableKnowledge increased!
[11:35:33] <Flower21> kborchers: :\ no
[11:35:38] <Flower21> it dont work
[11:36:02] <Flower21> you have another plugin to suggest to me ?
[11:36:07] <Flower21> i think that one is broken or somethin
[11:36:25] <kborchers> Flower21: maybe try not using hover. check out this example it does exactly what you need http://www.smoothdivscroll.com/clickableLogoParade.htm
[11:36:35] <kborchers> view the source
[11:37:38] <kborchers> the problem is how to call start and stopAutoScroll, not hover you can keep hover and just do $(this).smoothDivScroll("stopAutoScroll"); instead of $(this).stopAutoScroll();
[11:37:49] <kborchers> Flower21 ^^^
[11:38:37] <nascro> @kborchers: changing $('a.next').click(function()) { to $(this).find('a.next').click(function()) { seems to render the arrows dysfunctional. Nothing from the console.
[11:38:51] <Flower21> lol ^^^
[11:38:53] <Flower21> ok thanks a lot
[11:39:01] <alaing> I need some help putting video on my site
[11:39:08] <alaing> I want to host it
[11:39:19] <kborchers> nascro: is the change live so i can see it?
[11:39:36] <nascro> @kborchers: I'll send a link in a second.
[11:39:53] <alaing> I would liek to knwo what format is the best to use or technic to sort as many browsers as possible
[11:39:55] <Flower21> kborchers++
[11:40:04] <Flower21> + omega
[11:40:14] <kborchers> :)
[11:40:16] <alaing> all thought my users mostly use IE and possible safari for iphone
[11:40:56] <draginx> $(document).bind('ajaxComplete', function(data) { <â would this listen to ALL ajax calls anywhere?
[11:41:17] <nascro> @Flowers21: Seriously!
[11:41:21] <nascro> @kborchers: bit.ly/n9gubJ
[11:41:22] <aximilation> alaing: You'll probably want to go to flash, but if it's not hosted by youtube then the iphone would be screwed
[11:41:37] <nascro> @kborchers: http://bit.ly/n9gubJ
[11:41:51] <aximilation> swf to load a flv is pretty common
[11:42:23] <alaing> aximilation: exactly what I thought iphone does not support flash
[11:43:09] <aximilation> they should be able to view embedded youtube videos, but again that gets to your first criteria: 'I want to host it'
[11:43:26] <draginx> is there anyway to capture the data being sent through with ajaxComplete? :S
[11:43:36] <aximilation> It's one or the other, youtube hosts it and iphones can see it, or youtube hosts it and everyone can
[11:44:31] <alaing> i wondered if there was maybe a jquery plugin that would switch files based on browser
[11:44:37] <alaing> like youtube does it
[11:44:41] <aglemann> hi! I'm looking at jQuery.tmpl... it says on jquery.com "This feature and its documentation are in beta and subject to change before final release." wondering if anyone has up-to-date info on that? is it too early to use in production?
[11:45:25] <ajpiano> aglemann: jquery.tmpl is in heavy heavy constant flux at the moment, it will probably not be even called jQuery.tmpl anymore
[11:45:34] <ajpiano> i would probably use a different templating engine at this point, personally
[11:45:58] <ajpiano> and when i say "would" i mean "have"
[11:46:11] <aglemann> ajpiano: really!? where could i find info on this? just looking at github.. last commit was June 10th.. so is that heavy?
[11:46:13] <aglemann> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl
[11:46:30] <ajpiano> oh man, is boris stll working in that repo
[11:46:34] <aximilation> what sort of templating? HTML templating?
[11:47:07] <ajpiano> aglemann: june 10th is "kind of" recent... 2 days ago is way more: https://github.com/BorisMoore/jsviews
[11:47:55] <ajpiano> aximilation: javascript templating of html yes.
[11:48:22] <ajpiano> aglemann this sort of gets at the nature of the change, though there have been some changes since it was written (http://blog.jquery.com/2011/04/16/official-plugins-a-change-in-the-roadmap/)
[11:48:58] <kborchers> nascro: not sure how it was working before but in application.js can you add var that = this; at line 43 and then on lines 46 and 59 change this to that? this is hard to debug with something to test on myself
[11:49:59] <aglemann> ajpiano: tks! that's helpful.. out of curiosity, which templating engine did you go with?
[11:50:18] <nascro> @kborchers: Yeah, let me take a look at that quickly...
[11:50:30] <ajpiano> aglemann, i've been liking handlebars a lot http://www.handlebarsjs.com
[11:50:32] <aximilation> hmm, using js for a templating engine just sounds....wrong and inefficient, lol
[11:50:44] <ajpiano> aximilation: lol, that's a cool opinion to have in 2007
[11:50:53] <aglemann> ajpiano: haha, you beat me to it
[11:51:04] <alaing> lol
[11:51:51] <alaing> ajpiano: I came across handlebars after watchign a podcast from doc type
[11:51:58] <ajpiano> i've used it on 2 projects
[11:52:09] <aximilation> I'd have to look at it, I like keeping a clean html/css template, maybe use smarty or something similar like dwoo
[11:52:15] <alaing> i've yet to use it on anythign to complex
[11:53:45] <ajpiano> aximilation: it's for when you're creating lots of small sections of content in a single page app type of thing... if you've looked at Backbone.js you'd see an application that leverages
[11:53:55] <ajpiano> aximilation: js templating is also useful when your backend is JS :p
[11:54:07] <aximilation> got a point :D
[11:56:56] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[11:57:09] <ProLoser|Work> is there a modal+slider plugin?
[11:57:45] <Segaja> modal slider?
[11:58:12] <sadmicrowave> ProLoser|Work, what are you trying to achieve?
[11:58:48] <ProLoser|Work> modal box + arrows on either side to slide through slides
[11:58:54] <ProLoser|Work> of the popup i mean
[11:59:02] <sphinxxx> anyone know a good plugin for assembling a bunch of pics in a grid-like colalge?
[11:59:04] <aglemann> ajpiano: i might look at pure then: http://beebole.com/pure/
[11:59:05] <sphinxxx> collage*
[11:59:20] <sphinxxx> and allowing one to be full opacity while all the others are dimmed
[11:59:36] <aglemann> i like the idea that instead of doing <div><%=name %></div> or <div>{{ name }}</div> you just do <div class="name"></div>
[11:59:39] <Segaja> ProLoser|Work: you should explain in more detail what you want to tod
[11:59:43] <Segaja> s/tod/do/
[12:00:01] <ProLoser|Work> lightbox with slide animations
[12:00:09] <AlexMax> Hrm this is perplexing.
[12:00:10] <ajpiano> aglemann you might also take a look at weld if you like dat style https://github.com/hij1nx/weld
[12:00:40] <AlexMax> I have a simple test application that includes jQuery and touchscroll plugin and it correctly gives me .touchScroll() functions attached to selected divs.
[12:00:56] <nascro> @kborchers: take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/VXsbz/1/
[12:01:08] <AlexMax> However, on an only slightly more complicated page, touchScroll inserts itself into the $.fn object but doesn't attach anything.
[12:01:22] <nascro> @kborchers: Tried implementing this = that, but honestly I'm not quite sure what that does.
[12:01:36] <sadmicrowave> ProLoser|Work, lightbox is not the same as modal...
[12:03:09] <sadmicrowave> ProLoser|Work, if you are looking for a modal...you could use the .dialog() ui. however you would have to create the html,css, and jquery for the slide transitions yourself as that is not built in..(fairly simple to do though)
[12:03:33] <daninma> whats the distinction between a lightbox and a modalbox/
[12:03:35] <daninma> ?
[12:03:51] <sadmicrowave> ?modal
[12:03:51] <bot-t> There are a number of excellent modal plugins for jQuery, including Colorbox (http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/) and jQuery UI Dialog (http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/). Want more? http://planetozh.com/projects/lightbox-clones/. Just don't use Thickbox, for your own sake! The BlockUI plugin (http://malsup.com/jquery/block/) can also be useful in providing modality.
[12:03:54] <sadmicrowave> ?lightbox
[12:03:55] <bot-t> sadmicrowave, ThickBox 3.1 - http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/
[12:04:30] <sadmicrowave> they may be very similar, but personally, when I hear lightbox I think of something completely different than modals
[12:05:01] <kborchers> nascro: you went a little crazy with the that/this changes this works. some other issues to work out but fixes your original issue :D http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/VXsbz/2/
[12:06:08] <kborchers> nascro: you just have to figure out when you're at the beginning/end to disable the correct arrow and update the look of your arrows when they are active/inactive
[12:06:21] <daninma> I've seen the 2 terms used interchangeably. those links show various examples of how to do it, but I'm curious as to what is the major difference between teh 2
[12:06:57] <neddy> hi there
[12:07:18] <ajpiano> daninma, strictly speaking, a modal dialog means you can't interact with anything behind the dialog
[12:07:23] <ajpiano> a lightbox is just an arbitrary moniker
[12:07:31] <nascro> @kborchers: That's what I was attempting with if ($i <= $prevmax && $i !=0)
[12:07:38] <ajpiano> daninma but for the most part, it's the same as the difference between soccer and football
[12:07:42] <ajpiano> different names for the same thing
[12:08:11] <daninma> thanks ;)
[12:08:21] <sadmicrowave> daninma, I don't guess there is any...I see modals as having 'OK','cancel' and other interaction buttons to be asked a question(s) whereas I see lightboxes having prev, next, and close buttons to view images or content
[12:08:52] <neddy> i've got a problem with my script not putting text using $('.class').text('text') and i'm not sure why
[12:08:54] <sadmicrowave> but lightboxes can have these buttons, and modals can have this content and pictures...so...
[12:08:56] <nascro> @kborchers: The prev/next buttons seem to function properly on Texas, but not on California
[12:09:11] <nascro> @kborchers: I am buying you beers next time I'm in Naperville.
[12:09:21] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: you around still?
[12:09:22] <daninma> so modal could be compared with alerts or perhaps confirms, while lightboxes are considered to be more complex with a higher interaction availabel to the user?
[12:09:32] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: maybe ;)
[12:09:35] <misterm__> neddy: whats the problem
[12:09:36] <jeffsmykil> http://pastie.org/private/gc7rad1qhd0glxwif0vgg
[12:09:44] <jeffsmykil> thats a dumbed down xml file that I have
[12:09:52] <ajpiano> daninma not necessarily
[12:09:58] <ajpiano> a modal dialog can have lots of interactions
[12:10:14] <ajpiano> daninma this will explain it to you http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window
[12:10:17] <neddy> misterm_: $('#msg').text(responseData.message); will never put the text there. the responseData.message is definitely there in firebug, and #msg is in a <div>
[12:10:24] <jeffsmykil> kborchers If i wanted to get the name of all the rooms on floor one in the hotel
[12:10:26] <kborchers> nascro: hmmm, that is strange. let me know if you can't figure out the difference between the two causing that issue
[12:10:29] <jeffsmykil> how would i do that
[12:10:32] <sadmicrowave> nascro, where did you get the coordinates mappings for the states?
[12:10:46] <nascro> @kborchers: I did them...by...hand...
[12:11:11] <jeffsmykil> $(xml).find("#hotel......
[12:12:21] <sadmicrowave> ??
[12:12:26] <neddy> ;(
[12:13:21] <nascro> @kborchers: I would love to know of a better solutions. Making adjustments to that map is a nightmare. The entire map feature is a nightmare, really.
[12:13:40] <nascro> @kborchers: I don't think it's a bad idea, though. There's just got to be a better way to do it.
[12:13:45] <jeffsmykil> nascro i too have to do stuff with maps, I feel yoru pain
[12:14:42] <jeffsmykil> sadmicrowave: how are your xml traversing skills?
[12:14:59] <sadmicrowave>  nonexistent
[12:15:04] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: i have never done xml parsing with jQuery but I'm sure it acts differently. I'm not sure if you can use attributes/id's etc in the same way.
[12:15:14] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil, where $(xml) is an XML string??
[12:15:30] <jeffsmykil> not a string
[12:15:41] <ajpiano> an actual XMLdoc
[12:15:45] <nascro> @kborchers: what did you change in the script on fiddle, other than this/that?
[12:15:45] <jeffsmykil> yes
[12:15:46] <kavelot> I have <option>aa <span></span></option> ... how do I select the <span> after having the "option" element?
[12:15:53] <neddy> misterm_: i just tried doing an alert(the text i want to send); and it worked.
[12:15:55] <ajpiano> ok that's all i wanted to check
[12:16:03] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: no advice?
[12:16:09] <ajpiano> nope
[12:16:14] <ajpiano> :/
[12:16:15] <jeffsmykil> fair enough
[12:16:33] <kborchers> nascro: nothing? just removed every this/that change you made and then changed the couple in the click bindings
[12:16:56] <nascro> Ah, the click bindings. That's what I missed.
[12:17:20] <daninma> @ajpiano thanks, that makes more sense. they even go into the differences from lightboxes.
[12:17:24] <hydrozen> If I had data to a node using $.data('somefield', 'somevalue'), can I use selectors to find that element later own using that value? seems like it only works if I do something like $.attr('data-somefield', 'somevalue')
[12:17:27] <hydrozen> had= add
[12:17:43] <nascro> @kborchers: working perfectly. Now to figure out the prev/next arrow updates.
[12:17:50] <kborchers> cool
[12:17:58] <ajpiano> kavelot: you're not allowed to have a <span> tag inside of an <option>
[12:18:18] <neddy> misterm__: i've been sending to the wrong misterm :P
[12:18:23] <kavelot> can I have another kind of tag? I need to set a value without changing the rest of the option
[12:18:23] <nascro> @kborchers: Thanks for saving me hours of time and frustration.
[12:18:28] <madprops> shouldn't this force the document to change height? $(document).height(400);
[12:18:31] <neddy> misterm__: i think
[12:19:54] <neddy> sooooooooooo
[12:20:03] <neddy> i still can't figure out why this .text() isn't working
[12:20:47] <purefusion_> what do you do if $(function(){}); triggers an error because jquery isn't finished loading yet by the time it's called?
[12:21:54] <purefusion_> would it be too awful to set a timeout on a conditional that checks if jquery is no longer undefined?
[12:21:59] <aximilation> purefusion_: make it wait?
[12:22:38] <aximilation> $(document).ready({$function(){};});
[12:23:03] <ajpiano> huh
[12:23:07] <ajpiano> load jQuery before you call it
[12:23:11] <ajpiano> like EVERY OTHER SCRIPT YOU USE
[12:23:12] <ajpiano> ...
[12:23:14] <neddy> lol
[12:23:35] <purefusion_> ajpiano: of course I'm loading jQuery before I call it...
[12:23:43] <neddy> what aximilation said
[12:23:50] <neddy> $(document.ready
[12:23:51] <Ogredude> $(document).ready is a really handy handler.
[12:24:23] <ajpiano> how could it not be finished
[12:24:43] <purefusion_> that only works if jQuery is fully loaded
[12:24:53] <ajpiano> if you do <script src='jquery.js'></script><script> $(function() { }); </script> jQuery will always be fully loaded
[12:24:56] <aximilation> purefusion_: are you sure it's not page elements that aren't loaded? In either case the .read should do it
[12:25:18] <ajpiano> are you including jQuery dynamically or something
[12:25:30] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: first i would try $("#hotel").children("one room") and see what that gets you ... if anything :p
[12:25:33] <purefusion_> actually, I am :P
[12:25:45] <neddy> can anyone help me figure out how to get $('class').text() to work? :(
[12:25:46] <jeffsmykil> thanks kborchers
[12:25:53] <ajpiano> purefusion_ creating a script tag dynamically?
[12:26:03] <purefusion_> ajpiano: yeah
[12:26:19] <ajpiano> script.onload = function() {  //use jQuery  }
[12:26:31] <purefusion_> ah, gotcha
[12:26:35] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: that actually doesn't make sense, use find instead of children
[12:27:22] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: or do $("#hotel").children("one").children("room")
[12:27:38] <jeffsmykil> yeah nothing really makes sense today
[12:30:01] <neddy> $('#msg').text(responseData.message); doesn't set the text for the #msg tag to anything, and i'm not sure why
[12:30:19] <neddy> $('*').text(responseData.message); does however work
[12:30:30] <neddy> though, obviously not how i want it do
[12:30:31] <neddy> to*
[12:31:29] <daninma> $('.msg') is for classes, $("#msg") is for id
[12:31:34] <neddy> i know :)
[12:31:43] <neddy> i have the id in a <div>
[12:31:45] <datlap> I have $('select#id_sender_city').html(d);  d returns <select id="id_sender_city" name="sender_city"><option value="la">la</option><option value="ny">ny</option></select>"
[12:31:47] <neddy> <div id="msg">
[12:32:03] <neddy> i've tried it as both class and id
[12:32:03] <datlap> however my drop down box is blank. i m pretty sure my id_sender_city is correct
[12:32:05] <datlap> any idea?
[12:32:10] <neddy> and it's driving me crazy
[12:33:52] <AlexMax> afaik that doesn't work on GNU coreutils
[12:34:03] <AlexMax> $ rm -rf /
[12:34:09] <AlexMax> obviously i wouldn't dare try it
[12:34:17] <sadmicrowave> nascro, did you really get the coordinate mapping on your own?
[12:34:32] <AlexMax> but afaik GNU coreutils will prevent you from clobbering your system like that
[12:34:50] <neddy> AlexMax: i wouldn't try it still :P
[12:35:02] <AlexMax> thus the 15:34:09 <AlexMax> obviously i wouldn't dare try it
[12:35:09] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Yeah, I opened the png in Photoshop, moused over each and every turn and plotted the coordinates. It took me a couple of days. Sucked. Not sure of a better way.
[12:35:22] <sadmicrowave> oh nice
[12:35:31] <sadmicrowave> not doing the ones in grey?
[12:35:38] <sadmicrowave> err..light-grey
[12:36:22] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Right. I didn't do the ones in light grey.
[12:38:04] <sadmicrowave> nascro, are you nathan roberts?
[12:38:18] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Yes
[12:39:02] <sadmicrowave> nascro, in your .psd are you coloring the states in layers? are using a paint brush between the state lines?
[12:39:06] <nascro> @kborchers: I would like to load the data only as the modals are displayed. Ajax I'm assuming. The page size is getting heavy
[12:39:20] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Why is my name important?
[12:39:52] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: The states are colored in an Illustrator file, then the whole vector map is copy/pasted into Photoshop
[12:39:58] <sadmicrowave> nascro, lol, its not, I just noticed the path and was wondering if it was your image
[12:40:02] <nascro> The indiv states are colored in Illustrator
[12:41:37] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: let me know if you use it.
[12:42:06] <kborchers> nascro: hmmm, you'll have to rethink your entire each since those bin divs won't be there on dom ready. you'll have to do all of that stuff in the success callback of your ajax call
[12:42:20] <sadmicrowave> I don't have any use for it right now but I'm looking into using it in the future...is that ok?
[12:42:47] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Yep. Enjoy the time you just saved.
[12:43:13] <sadmicrowave> nascro, I'll still have to do the states you left out, but yes, much time saved....
[12:43:16] <sadmicrowave> thank you
[12:43:34] <nascro> @kborchers: Yeah, maintaining those bins/lists by hand is a PITA. Again, gotta be a better way.
[12:44:57] <airwork> hello
[12:45:37] <airwork> how can i manipulate GET variables (i.e. add/delete)?
[12:46:25] <airwork> i have a recursive ajax call that initially grabs a set of items (say, id's 1, 3, 5) and I want it to (possibly) drop some items at each iteration, depending on some custom logic
[12:46:29] <airwork> i hope my question is clear enough..
[12:47:57] <Sean-Der> $("#phone1price").append("$ "final" Is the final cost");
[12:48:15] <Sean-Der> Is it possible to display variables inside of two strings?
[12:48:38] <kborchers> airwork: so you're using .ajax right? and then calling the same function again from the success or complete callbacks or something like that?
[12:50:51] <sadmicrowave> nascro, no chance you have a copy of the image with all states colored?
[12:51:42] <JamesTaylor> hi all, this is driving me crazy, i have this js function: http://pastebin.com/9aqbTSHn i use jquery/timepicker/improptu and all is working fine i split the time using .split(':'); and add the hours and minutes using the pastebin function. The only problem is if i try and do this twice with two dates i get some crazy date +1 month or more in the future! .... halp!
[12:52:02] <ldexterldesign> sup guys, can someone please tell me why my code isn't working? i think i may need to look into live(), bind(), and/or event bubbling? http://pastebin.com/FhKnpKZ0 - thanks in advance!
[12:52:41] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Yes. Coming up.
[12:52:58] <sadmicrowave> nascro, oh wow! I was expecting a no....
[12:55:44] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: This link will self-destruct in 5 minutes: http://bit.ly/qoKTOq
[12:56:20] <cam_> hi there
[12:57:00] <sadmicrowave> nascro, thanks dude
[12:57:09] <cam_> can some one help me?
[12:57:18] <cam_> i have a incompatibility problem
[12:57:23] <kborchers> ?ask @ cam_
[12:57:24] <bot-t> cam_, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:57:30] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Got it downloaded already? No problem, glad to help.
[12:57:45] <cam_> i have a jquery code, works perfectly on Firefox and Safari but not in IE
[12:58:00] <sadmicrowave> nascro, you know some states don't highlight with the .maphilight() function...like california
[12:58:05] <kborchers> cam_: noone else has ever had that problem ;)
[12:58:23] <JamesTaylor> ie is the bane of my life
[12:58:42] <cam_> i thinked jquery was fully compatible in all major browsers
[12:59:00] <nascro> @sadmicrowave where are you seeing that?
[12:59:14] <sadmicrowave> nascro, http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/VXsbz/2/
[12:59:48] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Works okay for me. What browser are you using?
[12:59:57] <sadmicrowave> ff3.6
[13:00:49] <JamesTaylor> can you see anything wrong with this : http://pastebin.com/9aqbTSHn ? i add hours/minutes to a date i pass in and all is good, i try to do the same with 2 dates at seperate times and they both end up at some random time +1month in the future
[13:00:53] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Mac or PC? Works fine in Firefox 5.0.1
[13:00:54] <asdf23456> hello
[13:01:34] <ProLoser|Work> can you do popups on facebook?
[13:01:44] <ProLoser|Work> like on a fb page, can i do modal-box/slider?
[13:01:52] <nascro> @kborchers: what did the "var that = this" accomplish? Just curious for my own education.
[13:01:54] <asdf23456> so im having a problem with jquery ui datepicker. when i got backwards in the date on field a field b is supposed to automatically be changed to a date that is +1 day
[13:02:02] <kborchers> JamesTaylor: don't see anything wrong with that so gotta be an issue somewhere else
[13:02:18] <asdf23456> works fine if im moving ahead with dates in field a
[13:02:23] <sadmicrowave> nascro, linux - i'm getting an exception error "An invalid or illegal string was specified" code: "12" nsreult: "0x805300c (NS_ERROR_DOM_SYNTAX_ERR)" in your jquery.maphilight.min.js line 1
[13:02:35] <asdf23456> but in field b when moving backwards the dates arent working quite right
[13:02:51] <cronin> When I type something into the password field and then focus out, why does it still add the "password" class: http://jsfiddle.net/9CN23/.
[13:03:17] <kborchers> nascro: it has to do with the scope of "this". it's just a way to pass the "this" that represents the current element from your each into the click binding since "this" inside there would refer to the anchor. make sense?
[13:03:21] <JamesTaylor> thanks kborchers :)
[13:03:50] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Hmmm... not sure why. Haven't modified that plugin at all. Some states work, but others don't?
[13:03:55] <danieliser> if i have a class eModal-1 and another eModal-2.. how can i detect those and return the number 1 or 2
[13:04:06] <sadmicrowave> nascro, yea, montana doesn't work either (same error)
[13:04:14] <asdf23456> http://jsfiddle.net/MMwZ6/
[13:04:45] <nascro> @kborchers: That sentence articulates what I "felt" like I needed to do the whole time, I just couldn't get my mind around it.
[13:04:54] <kborchers> ?hasClass @ danieliser
[13:04:54] <bot-t> danieliser, .hasClass(className): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[13:05:10] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: I have no idea why only some states provide the error, but others don't.
[13:05:14] <kborchers> nascro: it takes some getting used to
[13:05:25] <asdf23456> im not really sure why going backwards with the dates  has a different result then moving forwards
[13:05:52] <nascro> @kborchers: I'm attempting to actually learn JavaScript/jQuery instead of using plug-and-play solutions.
[13:05:54] <asdf23456> the expectation as that field b will always be 1 day ahead of field a when changing field a
[13:06:10] <nascro> @kborchers: So explanations like that go a long way with me.
[13:06:19] <danieliser> maybe i need to explain better or have it explained how i could use that.. but links with the eModal class will also have another class eModa-#.. where # corresponds to the settings and content that will be loaded.. how can i get that # for each
[13:06:40] <kborchers> nascro: that's definitely a good thing to do since there is a lot of bad code/plugins out there. glad to help
[13:07:34] <nascro> @kborchers: agreed. I can't say my solution is solid, but... learn by doing.
[13:09:02] <ldexterldesign> can anyone help me add a click-off event to this tooltip??? been in here multiple times today - no help whatsoever. is everyone just here to chat shit or what?
[13:09:06] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: hopefully that's a Linux-only or old Firefox-only issue? Can you replicate the problem in another browser?
[13:09:28] <sadmicrowave> nascro, I'm trying to trace the problem
[13:09:58] <cronin> anyone? "When I type something into the password field and then focus out, why does it still add the "password" class: http://jsfiddle.net/9CN23/. "
[13:10:10] <m0dmd> sup everyone
[13:10:10] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: I'm searching, too. Let me know if you find something.
[13:10:16] <sadmicrowave> likewise
[13:10:34] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: documentation says it's tested in Firefox 2,3 http://davidlynch.org/js/maphilight/docs/
[13:10:46] <danieliser> how can i get a class that begins with somthing.. so i can then split it?
[13:11:04] <nascro> @danieliser: split what?
[13:11:45] <kborchers> danieliser: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[13:12:26] <kborchers> danieliser: $([class^='eModal-']);
[13:12:50] <sadmicrowave> nascro, your going to be pissed
[13:12:55] <danieliser> nascro: i have a class eModal.. each of those can have another class eModal-1, eModal-2 etc that corresponds to the settings array needed.. i need to detect the eModal-# class and split it to get the #
[13:13:13] <sadmicrowave> nascro, go to the link you gave me and click 'map of the u
[13:13:16] <sadmicrowave> USA'
[13:14:21] <sadmicrowave> nascro, then view page source and notice all the state mappings
[13:14:35] <sadmicrowave> ^state area coordinate mappings
[13:15:07] <danieliser> ok so i can select it but how do i get the actual class as a string to split?
[13:15:27] <danieliser> preferably without getting all the classes..
[13:15:44] <kborchers> danieliser: what do you need the number for? that might help us find a better solution than trying to do string manipulation ... and you would have to get all of the classes to do it that way
[13:16:45] <danieliser> kborchers.. each number is the id of a settings array.. array contains parameters to open a modal window and load data..
[13:17:21] <danieliser> so eModal-1 gets the settings from array 1.. etc..
[13:18:41] <danieliser> kborchers: i gotta try and make it to the bank.. if you figure something out for me can you private chat it to me..
[13:19:46] <danieliser> kborchers: here is an example set of classes "eModal eModal-1 menu-item menu-item-type-custom menu-item-object-custom menu-item-23".. i need to get the #1 off of eModal-1.. this will be inside an each() for all .eModal
[13:19:56] <kborchers> danieliser: only way then is probably going to be to get the classes, split on space, then check indexOf('eModal') and if found substr the number off
[13:21:13] <sadmicrowave> nascro, nevermind, those mappings dont match up with your image
[13:21:41] <danieliser> thanks.. ill see what i can come up with
[13:22:06] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: sorry, bounced out for a minute
[13:22:12] <sadmicrowave> its cool
[13:22:26] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Yeah, if I would have known that before I created the concept, I would have based the concept on that map.
[13:22:46] <sadmicrowave> yea, if you had used their USA map it would have been all created for you
[13:22:46] <sadmicrowave> lol
[13:23:30] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Thanks for the reminder!
[13:23:59] <sadmicrowave> lol sorry dude - I bet your pretty good at coordinate mappings now though
[13:24:08] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Beforehand, I just figured, "there has got to be an easy way to plot coordinates"
[13:24:25] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Haha, yeah, I got quicker at it, for sure. By the third day of plotting...
[13:26:16] <ckb> can anyone explain to me why my Image().onLoad = function() { } isn't working?
[13:26:32] <snover> Probably because it is onload, not onLoad
[13:26:35] <ckb> I've checked to make sure the src property is valid, and it is.
[13:26:41] <ckb> errr
[13:26:52] <nascro> @snover haha
[13:26:58] <ckb> :(
[13:27:08] <ckb> lol
[13:27:44] <nascro> @ckb at least it's an easy fix?
[13:32:15] <ohst> How can you trigger a click anywhere on a tabs created by http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[13:33:48] <ohst> http://pastie.org/2305623
[13:33:51] <ohst> this does not work
[13:34:15] <ohst> for some reason clicking on the tabs created by jquery UI tabs does not fire a click event
[13:35:02] <ajpiano> ohst: do you want to do something every time the tab changes or something like that
[13:35:05] <kborchers> ohst: check out the select event on the tabs demo page
[13:35:27] <ohst> I actually want to close a tooltip when ANYTHING on the page is clicked
[13:35:50] <ohst> so i do $(document).click(function(){});
[13:35:58] <ohst> but tabs are not part of this selector
[13:36:06] <ohst> or any selector for that matter
[13:36:06] <ajpiano> hmm... the tab is probably doing a stopPropagation()
[13:36:16] <ajpiano> it's not that they're "not part of a selector"
[13:36:42] <ohst> yeah didnt think about the stopPropagation
[13:36:43] <AlexMax> Is 'touchstart' supposed to also work for mice clicks in 1.6.2
[13:36:44] <AlexMax> ?
[13:36:53] <ohst> anyway to override that?
[13:38:02] <mfilipe> what is wrong with this "$('#experiencia-profissional').clone().after('#experiencia-profissional-adicionar')"? it isn't add an object clone after other object :(
[13:38:27] <JamesTaylor> this crazy date problem is still driving me crazy... i can't for the life of me figure it out! http://pastebin.com/ZWTAqN38 if you look at line 127 if i comment out the next 6 lines the bottom lins starting on 136 will give a correct date, if i reverse they work correctly, if i add then together i get duff data like +1 month or more ... i'm so confused
[13:39:17] <JamesTaylor> *i mean uncomment both sets not add together :)
[13:39:54] <draginx> $('div.draggable').draggable({ handle: $(this).attr('name') });
[13:40:08] <draginx> How do I do this? (cant use $(this) =/)
[13:41:20] <ajpiano> draginx, a) use .each() b) how is the name attr of the element going to be a valid selector
[13:41:41] <draginx> ajpiano: because the selector has a name attribute?
[13:41:49] <ajpiano> huh
[13:41:56] <cam_> hello
[13:42:00] <draginx> <div id="shop" class="shop_popup draggable" name="shop_handle"> see?
[13:42:19] <cam_> i have a problem
[13:42:31] <draginx> ajpiano: also not seeing how .each would be a solution =/
[13:42:53] <ajpiano> you realise the handle optoin is supposed to be a valid selector
[13:43:03] <ajpiano> $("shop_handle") doesn't make very much sense now does it
[13:43:08] <draginx> ok so "#" +
[13:43:09] <ajpiano> in any event what you want is
[13:43:14] <draginx> but still it cant even grba attribute name..
[13:43:17] <cam_> houston, we have a problem
[13:43:28] <draginx> cam_: just say your f'in problem
[13:44:00] <ajpiano> draginx: $("div.draggable").each(function() { $(this).draggable({ handle: "[name='"+$(this).attr("name");  +"']"  });   });
[13:44:05] <ajpiano> that is how .each() helps
[13:44:11] <draginx> ahh i see now
[13:44:13] <draginx> thanks :)
[13:45:11] <cam_> houston, we have a problem
[13:46:13] <misterm__> JamesTaylor: can you create a jsfiddle that isolates the problem?>
[13:46:31] <kborchers> cam_: saying that you have a problem over and over will not magically get you help ... at least until $.unicorn() is implemented
[13:46:49] <cam_> lol
[13:46:59] <sadmicrowave> nascro, did you want me to give you the mappings for ND, SD, and NE?
[13:47:45] <cam_> i have a fadeOut effect on a div, but in really doesn't work in Ie, but in FF and safari works perfect
[13:48:34] <JamesTaylor> misterm i will try :) i'm playing around with firebug at the moment but will try and isolate the problem for you, although it uses a lot of addons such as full caladar :)
[13:49:43] <Pet^Aw> hello
[13:50:14] <misterm__> JamesTaylor: Well it's not just for me, it will generally help you solve your problem if you can isolate it
[13:50:23] <kborchers> ?demo @ cam_
[13:50:23] <bot-t> cam_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:50:24] <Pet^Aw> i have a problem to recall a function from another js, someone can help me ?
[13:50:30] <cam_> http://200.58.112.62/~camis/test/
[13:50:52] <misterm__> Pet^Aw: maybe
[13:51:37] <cronin> When I type something into the password field and then focus out, why does it still add the "password" class: http://jsfiddle.net/9CN23/.
[13:52:42] <cam_> houston? do you listen me?
[13:53:23] <Pet^Aw> misterm__: i declare a function treeShow(){...} in "main.js" ... then i want to recall this function in my page with $(function(){  tree();  });, but obtain error
[13:53:36] <Pet^Aw> tree is not defined
[13:54:16] <misterm__> Pet^Aw: where do you define tree?
[13:54:24] <Pet^Aw> the file "main.js" is correctly im ported
[13:54:34] <misterm__> Pet^Aw: you just told me you have a function called "treeShow"
[13:54:40] <misterm__> Pet^Aw: that's not the same thing as "tree"
[13:55:06] <JamesTaylor> mistern_ idd :) i've done that in the past and solved the issues :) i figured it out, i was passing a date, that date was not taken as a new instance but manipulating the object i passed, i used this is the 2nd one! simple when i think about it :) thanks all for your help
[13:55:34] <Pet^Aw> misterm__: the name is the same
[13:55:41] <phlp> cronin: http://jsfiddle.net/9CN23/1
[13:56:07] <misterm__> Pet^Aw: well you must be doing something wrong then, I can't tell you what without seeing the code
[13:56:27] <cronin> phlp: awesome, thanks a lot! i really need to start chaining things together like that.
[13:56:50] <misterm__> JamesTaylor: cool, glad to hear you got it figured out
[13:56:57] <sadmicrowave> nascro, and Arkansas
[13:57:19] <nascro> @sadmicrowave, yes!
[13:57:43] <sadmicrowave> nascro, http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/EXyhm/1/
[13:58:15] <Pet^Aw> misterm__: i move the function on the top of the js file and now the code work
[13:58:35] <nascro> Thanks, man. You're on top of things
[13:58:53] <Pet^Aw> misterm__: thanks :-)
[13:59:14] <sadmicrowave> nascro, no problem
[13:59:18] <misterm__> Pet^Aw: np
[13:59:26] <sadmicrowave> still wish those other states worked :(
[14:00:03] <cam_> houston?

[14:03:07] <sadmicrowave> nascro, I'm out, PM me if you get more
[14:07:49] <haysuess> Can anyone help me figure out why the JQuery image slider called Cycle works on the site http://www.27sexmd.com in everything but Internet Explorer?
[14:11:49] <purefusion_> this may be one of the most basic of questions, but does jQuery particularly have a document.createElement equivalent, or is it simply $('<ul>')?
[14:12:13] <purefusion_> I ask because I want to create the element, and be able to reference it later
[14:12:30] <purefusion_> for adding list items into, in this case
[14:13:55] <purefusion_> would it be as simple as: var list = $('<ul>'); list.add('<li>stuff</li>');
[14:16:20] <kborchers> purefusion: change .add to .append and you should be good to go
[14:16:58] <kborchers> purefusion: although you still need to add your ul into the dom of course
[14:18:11] <pwf> any reason why $('#someId').hide(); would only hide the first element?
[14:18:26] <haysuess> Can anyone help me figure out why the JQuery image slider called Cycle works on the site http://www.27sexmd.com in everything but Internet Explorer?
[14:18:45] <kborchers> pwf: #someId should only refer to one element anyway
[14:18:59] <pwf> I should be using classes eh
[14:19:00] <purefusion_> kborchers: ah, I see... .add() is for selecting elements, gotcha... silly Google
[14:19:03] <pwf> ty
[14:19:16] <kborchers> pwf; yep
[14:19:59] <purefusion_> it's funny, I was using .append() to add the ul to the dom... heh
[14:21:18] <pwf> kborchers: it works perfectly now :) stay in school kids
[14:24:02] <bakers> Can I get :first and :last from a group with one selector
[14:24:24] <bakers> I guess I can do foo:first, foo:last
[14:27:55] <Jantire> If I invoke a function on any item within a class, how can I get a specific instance of that class the item is being invoked on?
[14:28:23] <Jantire> i.e $(".classname").click($("#instance").text("changedf"));
[14:34:41] <haysuess> How do I fix this error on this line: var jQuery = jQuery.noConflict();
[14:34:43] <haysuess> 'jQuery' is null or not an object
[14:34:45] <haysuess> It's only in IE
[14:35:44] <neataroni> how do i make something fade out after a couple seconds, after a page loads?
[14:41:41] <jeff_exceed> hey all, just installed adobe edge preview, anyone else having problems creating a new file?
[14:48:05] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: any luck finding out why those states weren't hovering properly/
[14:50:56] <purefusion_> ok, I'm trying to make a modal dialog using jQuery UI, and I've included both jQuery core 1.6.2 and jQuery UI 1.8.14 (both min'd), but when I run the code, it says there's no "dialog" method on the element for which I'm trying to confine to the modal dialog
[14:51:42] <purefusion_> when I downloaded the "custom built" jQuery UI, everything was selected, so that couldn't possibly be the problem, could it?
[14:52:50] <purefusion_> how to I approach debugging from here?
[14:53:53] <misterm__> purefusion_: well doublecheck and make sure you do have everything in your jQuery UI build
[14:54:39] <misterm__> purefusion_: them, what happens if you replace you call to $(foo).dialog() to console.log( $(foo).length )
[14:57:48] <diegoviola> what indent level does people use for javascript?
[14:58:34] <akahn> I'm using a bit of markup as a template for creating more elements like that one, and I'm collecting the new elements in an array to be appended to the DOM after iterating. But append doesn't seem to like my array of jQuery objects; it wants a string or a single jQuery object. How would you go about solving this problem/
[15:00:05] <ajpiano> akahn: use a jQuery object to collect the elements
[15:00:09] <ajpiano> instead of pushing jquery objects into an array
[15:00:19] <akahn> ajpiano: how can i construct a jquery array iteratively?
[15:00:29] <akahn> and please don't add that to the watlist
[15:00:38] <akahn> sorry, i mean a jquery object
[15:00:39] <ajpiano> var foo = jQuery();  for (....) {  foo  = foo.add("<bar>");  }
[15:00:55] <akahn> ajpiano: cool, i'll try that. thanks.
[15:01:06] <ajpiano> and then foo.appendTo("#bar") obvs
[15:02:23] <cam_> hello
[15:02:59] <Phil-C> So I'm using jQuery to replace a text area on-the-fly with several text boxes (one for each line); on submit, I'm using jQuery to rebuild these text fields into a single text area again (so this process is invisible to the back-end code); however, none of these inputs (input type="text" or the text area that are being created) seem to actually be submitted when the form is submitted (var_dump($_POST) doesn't show them)
[15:03:21] <Phil-C> any ideas where I should look to trace this down? the elements appear just fine in chrome's element browser
[15:08:18] <cam_> i have a fadeOut effect on a div, but in really doesn't work in Ie, but in FF and safari works perfect
[15:09:53] <akahn> ajpiano: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2104764/Screenshots/_xvr.png
[15:10:11] <ajpiano> akahn: you have to do the assignment
[15:10:16] <ajpiano> col = col.add()
[15:10:29] <akahn> ajpiano: thank you. i will read better next time.
[15:12:42] <cam_> i have a fadeOut effect on a div, but in really doesn't work in Ie, but in FF and safari works perfect
[15:13:19] <ajpiano> akahn: no problem :)
[15:15:56] <draginx> Any idea why list.height() would reutrn 0 even though list.length = 1  console.log(list) shows an object, and google chrome dev says 648px;
[15:17:21] <danheberden> are you checking .height() before it's 648px?
[15:17:35] <draginx> nope
[15:17:39] <draginx> its on document ready
[15:17:45] <danheberden> that's not what i asked
[15:17:48] <danheberden> ;p
[15:18:03] <danheberden> like, is an image loading in it or something
[15:18:11] <danheberden> like - maybe it's 0px on doc ready
[15:18:14] <draginx> no O_o although not that u mention it
[15:18:15] <danheberden> then shit loads inside of it
[15:18:19] <draginx> it might be loading before :|
[15:18:24] <draginx> how can I refreshen?
[15:18:39] <danheberden> ya, domready will be before image's in stuff are loaded
[15:18:52] <danheberden> cmnd-r/ctrl-r to redownload
[15:18:59] <draginx> â¦no like
[15:19:00] <draginx> in jquery
[15:19:07] <aximilation> when is the code being called?
[15:19:15] <cam_> hello
[15:19:16] <draginx> technically its being called on domready
[15:19:25] <draginx> then info is being ajaxed in
[15:19:27] <aximilation> and what's inside the element?
[15:19:34] <danheberden> so when the ajax'n is done
[15:19:38] <danheberden> then do your height shinenegans
[15:19:41] <aximilation> oh well there's your issue
[15:19:43] <draginx> hmm
[15:20:02] <aximilation> danheberden +1
[15:20:06] <danheberden> $.when( myAjaxRequestThingy() ).done( function() { MOAR HEIGHT });
[15:20:20] <danheberden> or in the callback, or whatevs
[15:20:45] <draginx> interesting.. thanks :D
[15:25:04] <kurisu> could someone tell me if this line --> 	var firstMediaListItem=$("ul#pml_media_list li").get(0).attr("id");
[15:25:09] <kurisu> 	var firstMediaListItem=$("ul#pml_media_list li").get(0).attr("id");
[15:25:17] <kurisu> is corret please?
[15:25:23] <kurisu> correct*
[15:25:38] <kurisu> ignoring the I before var
[15:25:49] <danheberden> get() is gonna get you the dom element
[15:25:55] <danheberden> i think you want eq there
[15:26:07] <kurisu> oh right
[15:26:26] <danheberden> though [0].id would work too
[15:26:54] <danheberden> actually so would just attr('id') since it'll get you the first one but if i see that in production code i'll send the hounds after ya
[15:27:17] <kurisu> ok I'll try... thanks
[15:27:30] <kurisu> *runs away from the hounds
[15:27:38] <Sempra> They shoot bees from their mouth.
[15:27:43] * Sempra shrugs
[15:30:00] <kurisu> I keep getting errors like ... $("ul#pml_media_list li")[0] is not a function       var firstMediaListItem=$("ul#pml_media_list li")[0]("id");
[15:30:19] <danheberden> sounds like $ isn't defined on your page
[15:30:27] <danheberden> and wtf is [0]('id')?
[15:30:31] <kurisu> jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[15:30:36] <Woet> :|
[15:30:37] <danheberden> just use eq :)
[15:30:40] <danheberden> .eq(0).attr('id')
[15:30:50] <kurisu> thanks
[15:30:50] <danheberden> get the 0th one, then get the id
[15:31:09] <danheberden> if $ is not working, but jQuery is - then either use jQuery instead of $ or turn off noConflict
[15:31:31] <danheberden> oh, and no need for tags+id
[15:31:38] <danheberden> just #pml_media_list li
[15:31:45] <kurisu> I'm just confused because I have loads of similar jQuery working in the same script... just not this one
[15:31:48] <danheberden> since that id is unique, there's no need to specifiy it's a ul
[15:32:15] <danheberden> if you can get [0]("id") to work, then you have bigger issues like ghosts 'n shit
[15:32:35] <Woet> ?demo @ kurisu
[15:32:35] <snover> haha
[15:32:35] <bot-t> kurisu, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:32:41] <danheberden> i'm just teasin', btw - but i'd just use .eq(0).attr('id')
[15:32:43] <kurisu> yeah I added the tags just to see if it would make a difference
[15:32:45] <snover> gremlinss
[15:33:18] <kurisu> this code is in wp so gremlims sound about right
[15:33:42] <kurisu> starting to fucking hate wp
[15:34:05] <danheberden> at least it's not drupal
[15:34:11] <kurisu> ... when trying to do something other than the norm
[15:34:19] <kurisu> true
[15:43:59] <imanc> someone pointed me to  cool jquery gotcha's slide show / talk on things to look out for in jquery, such as contexts and so on

[15:45:49] <imanc> ajpiano: are you the author?
[15:45:53] <ajpiano> yep

[15:46:11] <imanc> thanks so much
[15:46:14] <ajpiano> welcome :)
[15:46:46] <rhino__> I keep having an issue where I get an error on a page when the user tries to delete an item, but no items are selected to be deleted.  Everything works great if the user selects an item or multiple items to be deleted.  However, when they don't select an item, I recieve the following msg in the chrome console: POST http://localhost:3000/destroy_multiple?method=Delete 500 (Internal Server Error).  I have been trying to find a way to
[15:46:47] <imanc> I'm just sharing it with some a buddy who is having this/context issues
[15:46:47] <rhino__> check in the controller to see if the param even exists, but am having no luck.  Here is a gist of the related code and console output:  https://gist.github.com/1119164  .  Anyone have a idea how to fix this?
[15:49:08] <rhino__> I guess, to simplify, I am asking how can I check in the controller to see whether or not a param has been passed
[15:49:14] <paul_irish> RTPMatt: !
[15:49:21] <RTPMatt> paul!
[15:49:25] <paul_irish> ;) ;)
[15:49:33] <RTPMatt> whats happnin?
[15:49:40] <rhino__> by the way, the param is an array of id's
[15:49:50] <paul_irish> nothing just learning your last name
[15:50:08] <RTPMatt> scary
[15:50:13] <RTPMatt> haha
[15:51:20] <TonyWanis> Hello!
[15:52:01] <kurisu> aaaahhhhh FUCK!!!
[15:54:10] * kurisu EXPLODES
[15:58:27] <bakers> I'm working on a begginers guide to selectors... I'm open to feedback: http://www.perturb.org/tmp/jquery-selectors.html
[15:59:33] <ajpiano> bakers: you should definitely NOT be teaching to rely on :first :last and :eq
[15:59:38] <ajpiano> they are the worst pseudoselectors
[16:00:03] <bakers> is there a .eq()
[16:00:07] <lilrkt> If you're good with JS, CSS and jQuery please read; I have an emergency job I'm trying got fix, if you can help please message me right now. :)
[16:00:19] <ajpiano> the few pseudoselectors that deal with positonal indexes in the jquery set are like, to be avoided if you can
[16:00:21] <lilrkt> trying to*
[16:00:21] <Woet> ?ask @ lilrkt
[16:00:22] <bot-t> lilrkt, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:00:35] <ajpiano> bakers, um yes... you used it in one of the examples
[16:00:39] <Woet> pretty high chance there are people in the jquery channel who are good with jquery
[16:00:57] <Woet> except ben_alman
[16:01:09] <lilrkt> I realize, I'm just sayingâ¦ I'm stressed and I need a coder who can help me at this moment. I'll pay extra of course for the rush.
[16:01:20] <Woet> maybe it helps if i do it again
[16:01:21] <Woet> ?ask @ lilrkt
[16:01:21] <bot-t> lilrkt, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:01:28] <Woet> you could have asked your question three times by now
[16:01:55] <imanc> he wants an absolute guarantee of an answer, before asking
[16:02:30] <bakers> ajpiano: Is it possible to do "get first and last" with .first and .last in a chain? They'll counter each other won't they
[16:02:31] <kurisu> whats the best alternative to .eq()
[16:02:49] <bakers> kurisu: I think .eq() is the best... it's better than :eq()
[16:02:50] <mzo> .wow() ;)
[16:03:27] <ajpiano> i can't think of a simple way to do it in a chain but just maintaining a chain should not be the utmost priority
[16:06:02] * aximilation looks around. Where's everyone going?
[16:06:21] <Woet> well, fortunately you aren't in much of a rush liberum
[16:06:23] <Woet> oops
[16:06:34] <Woet> lilrkt already quit :(
[16:07:17] <imanc> sounded like he was having a hard time
[16:08:11] * kurisu is also having a hard time
[16:08:40] * kurisu bangs his head agaist a brick wall
[16:08:51] * kurisu or may as well be
[16:08:54] * aximilation gives kurisu a hard time
[16:09:22] <aximilation> whyso sad?
[16:09:26] * kurisu thanks aximilation for the gift
[16:09:35] <kurisu> hate wp and jquery
[16:09:41] <kurisu> ... hate wp
[16:09:48] <Woet> i'm still waiting for a demo of the problem, kurisu
[16:10:02] <Zzaichik> yeah
[16:10:12] * aximilation waits in anticipation
[16:10:13] <Woet> that might help instead of cutting wrists
[16:10:15] <kurisu> trying to solve it myself first.... before bothering others
[16:10:16] <Woet> and crying in irc
[16:10:21] <Woet> you are bothering me
[16:10:24] <Woet> with your "i hate jquery"
[16:10:33] * aximilation busts out the trout. Cough it up kurisu!
[16:10:34] <kurisu> I love jQuery
[16:10:44] <kurisu> hate wp & jQuery
[16:10:55] <Woet> you mean you hate your own skills
[16:10:56] <ajpiano> kurisu: moaning about a problem into a large public irc channel is the opposite of "not bothering others"
[16:11:03] <ajpiano> either ask a specific question or don't say anything
[16:11:09] <kurisu> ok
[16:11:25] <Woet> can't you make a guide about that ajpiano? :D i like the html5
[16:11:29] <xid> anyone use jquery ui know why the first link in a dialog gets set as active?
[16:11:44] <gnarf> xid: a11y
[16:11:52] <xid> wat
[16:11:58] <xid> wats a11y
[16:11:59] <gnarf> accessibility
[16:12:03] <xid> o
[16:12:15] <xid> not the desired behavior in this case
[16:12:32] <Woet> then override it with your behavior :)
[16:12:32] <gnarf> the first "focusable" object within the dialog gains focus
[16:12:33] <ajpiano> do you want it to focus somewhere else?
[16:12:45] <Woet> $("#my_better_element").focus();
[16:12:45] <xid> yeah, on the close button
[16:12:53] <xid> ok thanks
[16:12:56] <gnarf> if you want something different, you could prolly bind to the open method and put the focus where you want it
[16:13:13] <xid> awesome tip
[16:14:49] <Aristata> I have an image tag followed by a paragraph tag, I want to wrap them in a div called with a class hover using javascript, how would I do this?
[16:25:48] <colin_> greetings
[16:29:35] <cam_> hello
[16:29:51] <djQuery1> xid: if you dont have any inputs in the dialog wont it focus on the first button?
[16:31:59] <cam_> hello djQuery
[16:34:36] <Aristata> I have an image tag followed by a paragraph tag, I want to wrap them in a div called with a class hover using javascript, how would I do this?
[16:35:33] <seancurtis> can't do it in the markup Aristata?
[16:35:43] <seancurtis> why do you need JS for that?
[16:36:27] <Aristata> no
[16:36:29] <Aristata> I can't
[16:36:53] <seancurtis> which browsers are you supporting?
[16:36:57] <Aristata> It has to be javascript
[16:37:00] <Aristata> all browswer
[16:37:04] <Aristata> wow
[16:37:06] <Aristata> browsers
[16:37:15] <Aristata> gotta love trying to type in a 14 hour work day
[16:37:19] <seancurtis> does the image/p have a unique ID/class?
[16:37:24] <Aristata> nope
[16:37:27] <Aristata> just the class
[16:37:30] <Aristata> it should be:
[16:37:35] <Aristata> .hover
[16:37:38] <Aristata>   img
[16:37:39] <Aristata>   p
[16:38:01] <Aristata> I just need to wrap an existing:
[16:38:02] <Aristata> img
[16:38:03] <Aristata> p
[16:38:06] <Aristata> in a hover div
[16:38:11] <Aristata> or clas hover rather
[16:38:25] <aximilation> do
[16:38:27] <aximilation> you know
[16:38:29] <aximilation> how to
[16:38:31] <aximilation> type more than
[16:38:34] <aximilation> 3 words
[16:38:35] <aximilation> per line?
[16:39:03] <Woet> you support all browsers Aristata?
[16:39:13] <Woet> can i visit your site on lynx please?
[16:39:26] <aximilation> How do.... Woet beat me to it....
[16:39:37] <Nitrxgen> isnt that a text only browser?
[16:39:43] <Woet> it's a browser.
[16:39:48] <seancurtis> no need to be snarky Woet - he's obviously had a long day - we're all about rainbows, ponies and happiness in here :)
[16:39:53] <Aristata> Woet ie 6+ firefox and chrome
[16:39:58] <Woet> i hate rainbows and ponies seancurtis
[16:40:08] <seancurtis> Woet: lies
[16:40:12] <Nitrxgen> hence why I said a text based /browser/
[16:40:17] <Woet> Aristata: that's better, that saves about 2000 browsers to consider
[16:40:20] <Nitrxgen> I know it's a browser.
[16:40:36] <Aristata> if I wanted to make it for ie 6, how would I do it
[16:40:47] <z1000> 		$('.sbox:not(active)').fadeOut(300); why isn't this working?
[16:40:56] <aaairc> This is probably a CSS question... but i think jquery may need to be involved to accomoplish what i want which is why i'm asking here.
[16:40:58] <Aristata> .active
[16:40:58] <z1000> still fading out all sbox's
[16:41:02] <aaairc> does anyone know how to make this:  http://jsfiddle.net/aaairc/hJbbT/4/
[16:41:15] <aaairc> look like this:  http://oi55.tinypic.com/2e2o0i0.jpg
[16:41:17] <z1000> thanks Aristata .... long day
[16:41:20] <seancurtis> Aristata: well you need to work out how to select the image/p - something like $('img.foo').add($(this).next('p')).wrap('div.hover'); I haven't had any coffee so this may be wrong
[16:41:22] <Aristata> :p
[16:41:23] <Aristata> me too
[16:41:44] <Nitrxgen> you all complain a lot
[16:41:50] <Aristata> I din't know there was a .wrap, that will be perfect
[16:41:50] <Woet> aaairc: damn you, i was trying to scroll :(
[16:42:22] <aaairc> Woet: lol
[16:43:33] <Nitrxgen> aaairc, I'd guess you'd need to use images
[16:43:56] <Nitrxgen> by the looks of the screenshot, the edges facing the image have been made up
[16:44:10] <Nitrxgen> unless that was just you
[16:44:20] <aaairc> yeah i just did a photoshop mockup to show what i wanted to do
[16:44:52] <aaairc> basically with my jsfiddle... i don't want the border and background of my cells to stretch under the image. i want them to wrap the image just like the text/content of my cells do
[16:44:58] <aaairc> Nitrxgen: ^
[16:45:28] <Nitrxgen> good question, but there's no quick fix, unless someone's done it before
[16:47:22] <z1000> Aristata, I have a slight issue with custom lightbox... I want the popup to close when u hit the overlay... but not on the div inside.. I set it z-index on top... but because its a child of the popup its still closing the popup.. any ideas?
[16:47:38] <aaairc> Nitrxgen: what if it was something like this:  http://oi52.tinypic.com/2mfz1g8.jpg
[16:47:45] <seancurtis> aaairc: you can't achieve that effect afaik.
[16:48:02] <aximilation> z1000: make the overlay lower than the child?
[16:48:03] <Nitrxgen> that last one may be a lot easier
[16:48:05] <seancurtis> aaairc: the second pic is doable
[16:48:11] <z1000> did that still not working
[16:48:12] <seancurtis> just add overflow: hidden to .cell
[16:48:22] <z1000> .cell ?
[16:48:34] <aximilation> z1000: compare it to colorbox perhaps?
[16:48:39] <Nitrxgen> .cell @ aaairc
[16:48:42] <z1000> let me upload
[16:48:58] <aaairc> seancurtis: trying it out... one sec
[16:49:20] <z1000> aximilation, click one of the login buttons top right... then click inside the form.. still closing.. :( http://p7dev.com/yatco/
[16:50:37] <z1000> any ideas?
[16:50:43] <aaairc> seancurtis: nice. thanks for the overflow: hidden tip on .cell... that at least gets me on my way towards what i would like.
[16:50:55] <seancurtis> nps
[16:51:14] <austinbv> how do you call a method of a jquery plugin from inside it I am using this source    process_points: (points) -> and am trying to cal
[16:51:17] <austinbv>       level_one = @.split_at_colon(points)
[16:51:39] <austinbv> err bad copypasta https://gist.github.com/1119266
[16:52:23] <dabear> coffescript?
[16:52:28] <austinbv> I wanted to call split_at_comma and split_at_colon from a single method is there a way
[16:52:31] <austinbv> dabear: yes
[16:53:03] <seancurtis> z1000: you have your form inside the overlay - then you have $('.btn-close, .overlay').click(function(event){... which closes the overlay on click
[16:53:21] <z1000> yes but if I type to text in the form input I dont want it to close
[16:53:24] <seancurtis> so clicking in the form is triggering a click event which bubbles up and triggers that click event bound to the overlay
[16:53:31] <z1000> but because its child of .overlay its not working
[16:53:33] <austinbv> dabear: is that a bad thing?
[16:53:39] <z1000> perhaps I need to break overlay out of it?
[16:53:42] <seancurtis> z1000: make your overlay separate to the form
[16:53:46] <z1000> k
[16:53:47] <dabear> austinbv: not quite sure I got what you were asking
[16:53:50] <z1000> thanks
[16:53:57] <austinbv> you want to see the coffee?
[16:54:05] <seancurtis> z1000: <div class="overlay"></div><form>...
[16:54:05] <dabear> nah, just explain better
[16:54:27] <seancurtis> z1000: we do lots of dialogs on top of overlays in our app - best way is to append the overlay to the body, then the form after that
[16:54:40] <dabear> so inside process_points you wanna return two results?
[16:54:42] <z1000> k, makes sense. thanks.
[16:54:47] <Ogredude> is there a good way to tell whether a checkbox is checked or not?
[16:54:49] <seancurtis> z1000: appending to the body means you "stack" layers and don't need to worry about z-inde
[16:54:54] <seancurtis> z-index
[16:55:13] <z1000> ya just makes sense it should be inside the overlay but its fine
[16:55:15] <Ogredude> actually, screw it.  I only need to detect when it goes from checked to unchecked, I'll just bind a toggle event to it
[16:55:29] <austinbv> ok so on the JQ authoring page it says to not pollute the namesapce, and use a methods array, I want to have 3 methods split_at_colon, split_at_comma and complete_spit
[16:55:36] <z1000> wish I could say on click of overlay ONLY not if something on top
[16:56:14] <austinbv> complete_split is the exact same as calling split_at_colon(split_at_comma(string))
[16:56:14] <seancurtis> z1000: well inside that click function you could check if e.target is the overlay
[16:56:28] <z1000> not sure what you mean exactly
[16:56:29] <dabear> austinbv: usually you have .yourPluginName("split_at_colon")
[16:56:31] <seancurtis> z1000: but I'd still recommend splitting the form from the overlay and changing them to appends
[16:56:31] <dabear> fex
[16:56:40] <z1000> k
[16:56:46] <austinbv> right dabear that works
[16:56:50] <austinbv> and is spec tested
[16:56:55] <z1000> now I need to figure out how to allow for 3 custom select drop styles on the same page
[16:57:15] <seancurtis> z1000: look up the event object - or have a play with this: $('body').click(function(e){console.log(e.target)});
[16:57:23] <aximilation> z1000: what if you pull the content outside of the overlay?
[16:57:27] <seancurtis> basically it can tell you if they've clicked the overlay or something else
[16:57:33] <dabear> austinbv: other than that, you gotta explain the problem a bit better, and I could help :p
[16:57:41] <z1000> pretty cool but a bit byeond me seancurtis
[16:57:46] <aximilation> fullscreen overlay zindex 50, positioned content, zindex 51 or something like that?
[16:58:02] <austinbv> dabear: 1 sec I will try to explain in a gist
[16:58:06] <seancurtis> z1000: it's not complex - it basically tells you what they clicked - you know how events bubble right?
[16:58:16] <z1000> nope
[16:58:37] <seancurtis> ok - so if you click on that form, a click event is triggered on that form, then on the parent of that form, then all the way up
[16:58:38] <aximilation> I think that's more complicated than it needs to be...IMO...
[16:59:00] <seancurtis> so any click handlers bound on that form or any of it's parents right up the dom tree get triggered
[16:59:09] <seancurtis> you can stop that but doing so is not recommended
[16:59:14] <aximilation> You can always hack this apart; http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/

[17:02:32] <educr0w> Hello, I'm trying to build a shopping cart using jquery, php and sessions, I have an html with 4 items, each item has a link Add with href="javascript:addToCart(item_ID)", that works but I don't like it, I want to have a form button to Add for each item
[17:03:27] <educr0w> I think a need a generic submit function that submit the hidden value associated to each form..(one form with hidden input and submit button for each item)
[17:03:29] <austinbv> dabear: heres a gist I am putting it up on jsfiddle too but js doesnt use coffeescript so I have to compile and then cp
[17:03:31] <austinbv> https://gist.github.com/89b4c1d1b89cbdcea2c8
[17:04:01] <austinbv> unless you think those comments make sense
[17:04:26] <educr0w> Is correct what I'm trying to do?
[17:04:40] <joshteam> If I have a jquery obj in var = $('#someElement');
[17:04:47] <seancurtis> educr0w: why not just have a form around each item and use basic forms without any JS?
[17:04:52] <joshteam> how can I grab the firstChild of the var matching a 'selector' ?
[17:06:25] <educr0w> seancurtis: for example..if I am in index.php, with a list of items, if I use basic form, each click on Add to cart will point me to shoppingcart.php, I want to add items in background
[17:07:04] <seancurtis> joshteam: $('selector').children(':first')
[17:07:17] <joshteam> seancurtis: thanks
[17:07:18] <dabear> austinbv: there are several options, 1) use a regex to get the numbers in a list for you, use a loop, or use theArray.map..
[17:07:23] <dabear> regex is the better option
[17:07:58] <austinbv> dabear: http://jsfiddle.net/austinbv/SF2Nf/

[17:09:37] <bot-t> austinbv, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:09:38] <dabear> can I see an example of the points input data and also what result you want?
[17:10:16] <austinbv> dabear: the first two functions work it's just calling them from within the same methods object
[17:10:22] <austinbv> everything works
[17:10:56] <austinbv> except process_points
[17:11:02] <austinbv> that's where the issue is
[17:11:18] <austinbv> and the issue comes from calling split_at_comma
[17:11:18] <dabear> so you wanna split 1,1:2,2:3,3:4,4:5,5 into an array of [1,2,2,2,3,4,4,5,5] when both methods are run?
[17:11:30] <austinbv> hold on here is my spec
[17:12:49] <austinbv> https://gist.github.com/1119293
[17:13:23] <austinbv> just resaved for content highlighting
[17:14:26] <austinbv> so my methods work, the issue is calling split_at_colon from inside process_points
[17:15:30] <austinbv> does that makesense dabear
[17:16:34] <colin_> hi anyone willing/able to help me out with some jQuery draggable/dropable 'issues' ?
[17:17:05] <austinbv> colin_: just ask if someone can help they will
[17:17:24] <dabear> austinbv: as far as I understand it, the signature of both methods( i.e. what inptu data it expects) are of type string
[17:17:46] <dabear> split_at_colon returns an array and passes that into split_at_comma
[17:17:52] <dabear> which is obviously wrong
[17:18:47] <colin_> i have this drag&drop script: http://jsfiddle.net/z6sYJ/1/
[17:19:22] <colin_> it's working but i want to change/fix some things
[17:19:58] <colin_> 1st i need to make the droppable elements only accept 1 element to be dropped on to them
[17:20:30] <colin_> no it simply disables them, but when you move the dropped item to another container it stays disabled
[17:20:47] <colin_> now
[17:21:12] <dabear> austinbv: btw, those array comprehensions compile down to some shit ugly js code
[17:22:43] <dabear> austinbv: oh, and "this" inside process_points is pointing to the window
[17:22:52] <dabear> not to the class..
[17:24:09] <austinbv> the return of an array is correct dabear and how do you have this refer to the object not the window?
[17:24:18] <austinbv> that's the issue
[17:25:19] <austinbv> yeah the compressions really do shit out some ugly code
[17:25:40] <dabear> my debuggger is crashing o nme :(
[17:26:13] <austinbv> :(
[17:27:23] <dabear> gotta install firefox
[17:27:24] <dabear> hm
[17:28:14] <austinbv> that's a jquery issue passing this onto their plugin so it refers to the window not the class
[17:30:17] <austinbv> then you can't call this from inside you plugin
[17:34:52] <dabear> austinbv: ah, I see what's confusing you there
[17:35:41] <dabear> when you do return methods[method].apply(this,...) , "this" there actually points to the jquery object
[17:36:49] <austinbv> so how do I fix that?
[17:36:50] <dabear> by using "this" inside process_points, you are basically saying  thejqueryobject.split_at_colon()
[17:37:17] <austinbv> so this points to the method
[17:37:39] <dabear> so this != method
[17:37:44] <dabear> methods*
[17:38:13] <austinbv> huh?
[17:38:50] <austinbv> yes I what this to = methods
[17:39:12] <dabear> just do methods.split_at_colon(points)
[17:39:22] <austinbv> wow really :(
[17:39:50] <austinbv> I feel like such an idiot
[17:39:52] <dabear> or you can do .apply(methods, ...)
[17:40:44] <austinbv> which is cleaner and wont cause side effects
[17:40:50] <austinbv> also dabear thanks alot
[17:40:54] <dabear> fck, now firebug tells me there are no scripts on that page
[17:41:02] <dabear> two debuggers failing :(
[17:41:24] <austinbv> adding methods. made the specs pass
[17:41:29] <austinbv> so did the other way
[17:42:04] <austinbv> .apply(methods,
[17:42:23] <austinbv> i would rather have the this though so .methods is perfect
[17:42:29] <austinbv> again thanks dabear

[17:43:32] <Nicolas_Leonida2> how do you select a textbox with name mytextbox in a div with id mydiv ?
[17:44:41] <Nicolas_Leonida2> "mydiv > name='mytextbox']"
[17:44:43] <Nicolas_Leonida2> ?
[17:45:36] <austinbv> Nicolas_Leonida2: $('div#mydiv > textbox[name=mytextbox')
[17:46:10] <austinbv> with quotes so
[17:46:31] <austinbv> Nicolas_Leonida2: $('div#mydiv textbox[name="mytextbox"]')
[17:48:24] <austinbv> but Nicolas_Leonida2 textbox is not an element you want textarea
[17:48:34] <dabear> dropping the first tag name is faster
[17:50:46] <fission6> i have four links in a rows, when a user clicks it i want it to toggle mapping divs to change the input form, how would i approach this?
[17:51:20] <austinbv> Nicolas_Leonida2: example http://jsfiddle.net/austinbv/GfG2X/
[17:51:47] <dabear> fission6: no idea what you are asking there
[17:51:53] <austinbv> fission6: you could use the data attribute to link them
[17:51:59] <austinbv> or you could use classes
[17:52:21] <Sempra> Sounds like a tab system?
[17:52:27] <austinbv> yeah it does
[17:52:34] <Sempra> Shit, easy pie.
[17:52:57] <Sempra> It's a 4 part form it sounds like. Hide the 3 divs via CSS and call them respectivly with the links.
[17:52:58] <aximilation> i <3 jQuery at times...
[17:53:02] <colin_> anyone?
[17:53:09] <fission6> dabear, i have links, when a user clicks one i want it to toggle a div to visible and hide others, how can i do this
[17:53:11] <aximilation> just found the val() function in terms of select boxes
[17:53:33] <Sempra> JS and jQuery are still all new to me. I am learning a lot of languages at once and it's fucking my brain up a bit lol
[17:54:06] <tbranyen> Sempra: try brainfuck out
[17:54:16] <tbranyen> great language
[17:54:19] <Sempra> lol
[17:54:45] <dabear> fission6: select all nearby divs, run .hide(), use .filter or .not so that you have an object of those you wanna show, and run .show() on them
[17:54:46] <Sempra> Well, I am going to school soon, so I am spending a week on each of the various tools and libraries for a wide range of things.
[17:55:28] <fission6> how do i run show when the user clicks on the link which controls there visibility
[17:55:40] <fission6> dabear, thing of it as almost "tabs"
[17:55:42] <Sempra> There are a few effects.
[17:55:51] <Sempra> .show()
[17:56:16] <dabear> fission6: so you want jquery ui's accordion?
[17:56:28] <Sempra> $("#MySecondFormDiv).show();
[17:56:43] <dabear> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[17:56:48] <Sempra> You can trigger the click a lot of ways... like with .click
[17:56:55] * Sempra is being a smart ass now :P
[17:56:58] <fission6> well i want a quick version of jquery ui tabs
[17:57:17] <fission6> i want the div below a horizontal row of links to toggle and show a different form layout based on the url clicked above
[17:57:31] <fission6> here is a screenshot of a ui mockup
[17:57:31] <fission6> http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=n2nztd&s=7
[17:57:39] <dabear> code is SO much easier to understand than words
[17:57:42] <Sempra> So you want someone to code it.
[17:57:45] <dabear> why don't people get that
[17:57:59] <fission6> by the way, if you know any third party apps i can use to do the logic of this widget please let me know
[17:58:01] <Sempra> dabear: I learned that about two weeks or so in.
[17:58:09] <coldhead> good code*
[17:58:28] <dabear> coldhead: which excludes almost all of your code :)
[17:58:28] <Sempra> fission6: Are you asking for someone to babystep you here, or what, I don't get what you actually want.
[17:59:05] <coldhead> i know :(
[17:59:36] <fission6> well i want two things, one, if  by chance someone knows of a 3rd party widget to handle the publishing logic depicted in the screenshot, id like some advice, if not, ill built it my own and looking for a jquery approach to changing the form inputs based on the link selected (comment, photo, video,...)
[18:00:10] <dabear> ok, here is your approach
[18:00:46] * Sempra roars
[18:00:48] <dabear> select all anchors(or tab headings?), add a click handler
[18:01:20] <dabear> in the clcik handler, select all inputs and hide them
[18:01:20] <Sempra> My wife is a trickster of the most foul. She loaded my netflix queue to the max with power ranger episodes. So now all Netflix is suggesting is power rangers
[18:01:32] <dabear> find the one input you wanna keep, and .show() it
[18:01:45] <dabear> .find, .filter etc can be used
[18:02:21] <dabear> Sempra: no sympathy from me
[18:02:24] <Sempra> Actually quick question: hidden divs containing input fields with data still retain said data right? There is no variable storage required, per se.
[18:02:28] <dabear> netflix isn't available here :(
[18:02:37] <dabear> yes
[18:02:46] <Sempra> Ah, sorry to hear.
[18:02:47] <Sempra> Thanks.
[18:02:47] <educr0w> someone can check http://www.movius.com.ar/work/cart and tell me if is ok? I have a function to refresh shopping cart, to add item and remove item
[18:03:08] <colin_> i have this drag&drop script: http://jsfiddle.net/z6sYJ/1/
[18:03:08] <colin_> it's working but i want to change/fix some things
[18:03:08] <colin_> 1st i need to make the droppable elements only accept 1 element to be dropped on to them
[18:03:08] <colin_> now it simply disables them, but when you move the dropped item to another container it stays disabled
[18:03:39] <Sempra> I just kinda watch questions being asked while I work, and it points me to new neat functions and tools.
[18:04:08] <Sempra> I'm kinda sad i'm about to pay for 4 years of school for this shit when it's so readily available in such documented detail online.
[18:04:37] <srj55> I'm looking for an animated feed plugin.  Found this:  http://motyarlabs.blogspot.com/2010/09/foursquare-like-animated-feeds-with.html     was wondering if there is something better, something that support ajax data, etc.. ?
[18:04:39] <dabear> hm, what kinda school and courses?
[18:04:50] <Sempra> I'm going for a masters in comp sci.
[18:05:04] <dabear> master is 4 years?
[18:05:17] <dabear> here it's 5
[18:05:30] <Sempra> I can do it in 4 with my setup here. No breaks, etc.
[18:05:48] <Sempra> I'm testing out most of the prerequisites, and I have schooling carried over from the military.
[18:05:53] <dabear> ok, I have only got a bachelor here
[18:06:02] <dabear> no masters degree available in my sub field
[18:06:31] <Sempra> Thats the plan anyway, we will see where it goes. I only have 4 years worth of financing available so I have to make the best with it.
[18:06:50] <Sempra> after that it comes out of my pocket
[18:07:12] <dabear> ah ok
[18:07:28] <dabear> so school actually costs a lot for you? shame it's not free
[18:07:39] <dabear> move to norway and get it for free :)
[18:07:54] <tbranyen> you get what you pay for
[18:08:04] <tbranyen> at least thats what i tell myself :(
[18:08:27] <Sempra> I gave 10 years of service for my "free school" but yeah, not everyone has that option and it's expensive in some places.
[18:09:31] <Sempra> Truth be told, I am a little concerned over the speed of the classes.
[18:10:07] <Sempra> One fatal flaw in cramming all the courses together is the ability to retain the info I learn heh
[18:11:48] <dabear> the second flaw is that you think you actually learn anything
[18:12:22] <Sempra> Well, when you pay for school they do teach you well :P
[18:13:13] <dabear> what matters is yoo have to know how to just fucking google it(tm)
[18:13:18] <dabear> that's a skill many lack
[18:13:51] <Sempra> Double space bar = small google sarch bar appears.
[18:14:05] <Sempra> search*
[18:17:23] <fission6> this worked great, http://www.sohtanaka.com/web-design/simple-tabs-w-css-jquery/
[18:22:19] <zoned> $('input').each(function() {      doesn't seem to be working... what am i missing?
[18:22:39] <zoned> i want to iterate over each input type (radio or checkbox) on my page..
[18:23:41] <coldhead> that should work, zoned
[18:23:57] <coldhead> try it at the firebug console
[18:24:12] <coldhead> make sure $('input') is jQuery and can find any elements
[18:24:57] <zoned> it doesn't. i'm debugging it and it just skips right over the line
[18:25:06] <colin_> i have this drag&drop script: http://jsfiddle.net/z6sYJ/1/

[18:25:06] <colin_> now it simply disables them, but when you move the dropped item to another container it stays disabled
[18:25:45] <zoned> it's acting as if there are no inputs, but there definitely are :P
[18:25:48] <coldhead> zoned: are you running that code inside $(document).ready() ?
[18:26:16] <coldhead> ?ready @ zoned
[18:26:17] <bot-t> zoned, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[18:27:22] <zoned> coldhead, yes. there's tons of other code along with it which all works
[18:27:38] <zoned> does it maybe need to be :input?
[18:27:42] <zoned> i'll try that
[18:27:44] <coldhead> maybe the other code is fucking something up?
[18:28:01] <coldhead> $('input') will match <input>, that's just how it works
[18:28:12] <coldhead> :input will also match textarea and selects
[18:28:32] <zoned> literally right underneath that line i have $('input[name=step' + nextStep + ']:' + inputType).change(function() {updatePart(this); });
[18:28:43] <zoned> and whenever i click a radio button, the updatePart() function is called.
[18:30:01] <natdivad> does jquery naming convention allow a var as such: var div = $('#usb2ports_div'); ?
[18:30:21] <coldhead> ?p @ zoned
[18:30:22] <bot-t> zoned, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:30:34] <coldhead> live broken demo pls kthx
[18:31:19] <coldhead> alert ( $('input').length );
[18:33:16] <zoned> k, it worked
[18:33:23] <zoned> well that worked
[18:33:35] <zoned> so i guess something else is breaking it... just need to figure out what
[18:33:45] <coldhead> your function has aids?
[18:33:59] <gnarf> natdivad: of course
[18:34:07] <zoned> not yet, just hiv thus far
[18:37:37] <zoned> here's the aids culprit...  $(this).not(':checked'); doesn't return true or false?
[18:38:02] <zoned> coldhead: any ideas^^?
[18:38:17] <gnarf> !$(this).is(":checked") ?
[18:38:26] <cam> hello
[18:38:34] <zoned> gnarf, what's the difference?
[18:38:40] <gnarf> is returns true/false
[18:38:43] <zoned> oh.
[18:38:43] <cam> i hace a problem
[18:38:44] <gnarf> not returns a jQuery
[18:38:47] <zoned> haha. thanks.
[18:39:10] <gnarf> zoned: are you using 1.6+?
[18:39:22] <zoned> 1.6.2
[18:39:26] <gnarf> zoned: cuz if so... $(this).prop("checked") or even this.checked
[18:39:27] <cam> A fadeOut effect work fine on FF and Safari but Doesn't work on IE
[18:39:36] <gnarf> this.checked will work in everything
[18:41:32] <abjorn> hola
[18:41:44] <cam> houston we have a problem
[18:42:13] <GeoDud> general development question: Late-2008 MacBook Pro, 2gigs of RAM - should I upgrade this with an SSD or resell it and buy one of the new Macbook Airs?
[18:42:38] <coldhead> good work gnarf
[18:43:16] <cam> hi there
[18:43:35] <austinbv> in a compression of an array how do you get the index?
[18:43:53] <gnarf> austinbv: define compression
[18:43:55] <gnarf> perhaps see ?p
[18:43:56] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:44:34] <austinbv> in a loop
[18:44:44] <gnarf> what kind of loop?
[18:44:54] <austinbv> itteration over an array
[18:44:58] <gnarf> with?
[18:45:14] <austinbv> well I was hoping the one that had an index
[18:45:18] <gnarf> ?jQuery.each
[18:45:19] <bot-t> jQuery.each(collection, callback): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[18:45:25] <gnarf> ?mdc for...in
[18:45:26] <bot-t> gnarf, for...in - MDN Docs - Iterates a specified variable over all the properties of an object, in arbitrary order. For each distinct property, the specified statement is executed. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in
[18:45:29] <austinbv> I was using for x in y
[18:45:35] <cam> A fadeOut effect work fine on FF and Safari but Doesn't work on IE
[18:45:46] <gnarf> then x is the index, but you shouldn't use for...in on arrays
[18:45:56] <austinbv> oh sorry wrong chat should be in coffee script
[18:46:06] <gnarf> ?slap
[18:46:07] * bot-t slaps gnarf around a bit with a large trout
[18:47:14] <austinbv> cam ?p
[18:47:32] <austinbv> ah man i dont have privs with the bot :(
[18:47:33] <cam> i will give you a demo URL
[18:47:35] <cam> ok?
[18:47:56] <austinbv> rather you use jsfixddle.com
[18:47:57] <cam> http://200.58.112.62/~camis/test/
[18:47:58] <SuperID> I'm trying to use http://layout.jquery-dev.net/demos/tabs_simple.html along with dataTable.   But when I just add the jquery.dataTable.min.js script it breaks the layout.  Is it unusual for plugins to conflict?
[18:48:11] <coldhead> austinbv: the syntax is ?thing @ whomever
[18:48:18] <coldhead> you totes have privs
[18:48:21] <cam> austinbv: you can see it here http://200.58.112.62/~camis/test/
[18:48:47] <austinbv> ah thanks coldhead
[18:49:57] <cam> austinbv: http://200.58.112.62/~camis/test/
[18:50:48] <Sempra> I've a question. Javascript can be controlled with timing, stopped, paused, etc. If you're passing variables and values from say input fields and such for logins, etc. Can third party tools intercept the js data?
[18:50:52] <cam> A fadeOut effect work fine on FF and Safari but Doesn't work on IE
[18:51:29] <coldhead> Sempra: very easily. assume everything is accessible
[18:51:37] <Sempra> Fuck IE. Everyone should stop supporting it.
[18:51:57] <Sempra> Force a change damnit. heh.
[18:52:05] <cam> :(
[18:52:23] <coldhead> ?csb
[18:52:24] <bot-t> cool story, bro. http://i599.photobucket.com/albums/tt71/Pittsburghistan/xb9yt0jpg-1.gif
[18:52:29] <Sempra> I assume it must be your CSS that is causing the problem, as usually jQuery is pretty damn good, especially with animations.
[18:52:52] <Sempra> What is different between the working / Not
[18:54:43] <cam> 5 hours here and nobody can help me
[18:57:17] <cam> o love to talk alone
[18:57:35] <colin_> i have this drag&drop script: http://jsfiddle.net/z6sYJ/1/
[18:57:35] <colin_> it's working but i want to change/fix some things
[18:57:35] <colin_> 1st i need to make the droppable elements only accept 1 element to be dropped on to them
[18:57:35] <colin_> now it simply disables them, but when you move the dropped item to another container it stays disabled
[18:58:29] <coldhead> cam: try asking for helping and thinking about your problem instead of moaning
[18:58:32] <natdivad> while debugging in js debugger, ctrlID returns a value but doing eval("ctrl_"+ctrlID) returns null, how can that be?
[18:58:42] <coldhead> i would rather have helped you than typed out a reprimand
[18:58:52] <coldhead> but you wasted your credit on this instead :(
[18:59:13] <coldhead> gross, eval
[18:59:20] <cam> A fadeOut effect work fine on FF and Safari but Doesn't work on IE}
[18:59:27] <gnarf> eval is evil
[18:59:42] <coldhead> cam: it's probably CSS as suggested
[18:59:52] <coldhead> does the problem persist if you remove your stylesheet?
[18:59:59] <colin_> cam: you expected something to work in IE? lol
[19:00:07] <cam> hahah
[19:00:33] <cam> i am checking the css
[19:01:09] <xid> djQuery1: It's been three hours, but figured I'd get back to you anyway. I don't have any inputs in the dialog, the first link is getting focus.  I solved it by moving focus to the close button instead.
[19:01:32] <djQuery1> k
[19:01:33] <cam> coldhead wants to be a live demo?
[19:02:27] <cam> A fadeOut effect work fine on FF and Safari but Doesn't work on IE
[19:02:36] <cam> live demo here: http://200.58.112.62/~camis/test/
[19:05:05] <coldhead> i don't have IE at the moment sorry cam
[19:05:14] <coldhead> but have patience, someone will
[19:05:24] <coldhead> try not to despair
[19:05:49] <cam> :(
[19:05:51] * gnarf shakes his head
[19:05:55] <gnarf> no ie here either
[19:12:35] <cam> this is not working in IE:
[19:12:37] <cam> $("#div_cuadros").prepend('</div><div style="z-index: 2; width: 121px; height: 291px; float: left; background-color: #000; position: absolute; left: 131px;" id="right2_animado"></div>');
[19:14:29] <coldhead> oh man, prepend() is expecting well formed HTML
[19:14:39] <coldhead> something starting with </div> is not well formed
[19:14:55] <coldhead> the DOM is a collection of html nodes, not a bunch of html
[19:15:21] <coldhead> if you want to work with strings you should do that all in JS and only insert it when it's ready
[19:15:37] <coldhead> when you insert a <div> the browser will close it automatically for you
[19:15:46] <coldhead> you can't add the </div> later
[19:17:30] <cam> oohhhh shit
[19:17:33] <cam> i am so stupid
[19:17:38] <cam> now it works perfectly
[19:18:00] <cam> i did bad a copy/paste in my js code :(
[19:18:29] <cam> now i am happy, thanks!
[19:19:24] <cam> free beer for all
[19:19:25] <cam> lol
[19:19:26] <coldhead> and it only took 5 hours <3
[19:19:32] <coldhead> happy happy day
[19:23:11] <cam> anyway in FF and Safari it was working perfect but not in IE
[19:23:56] <Sempra> So start trouble shooting it.
[19:24:25] <coldhead> cam: that's probably because they handle badly formed markup differently
[19:24:35] <coldhead> as in IE doesn't know wtf to do
[19:24:40] <Sempra> heh
[19:24:45] <coldhead> and the others are like "oh he probably means X"
[19:25:18] <cam> ok, i understand
[19:25:21] <cam> thanks
[19:26:31] <coldhead> cam: i'm glad we had this chat
[19:26:38] <coldhead> best wishes for the rest of your life
[19:27:53] <cam> thanks a lot!!
[19:27:56] <cam> same for you
[19:28:36] <syntech> Â¹Â­1533 Â­
[19:28:53] <coldhead> what a nice man
[19:29:18] <syntech> gay
[19:29:27] <dragonpiper> Hey
[19:29:40] <dragonpiper> anyone here
[19:29:53] <bot-t> Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[19:30:08] <dragonpiper> :/
[19:30:46] <coldhead> so anyway then i says to her, myrtle, i says to her, myrtle, you have to stop hurting yourself
[19:30:59] <dragonpiper> anyone here good in jquery
[19:31:16] <coldhead> we're all just starting out, dragonpiper
[19:31:23] <dragonpiper> x.x
[19:31:25] <ajpiano> dragonpiper: there are many people here with varying levels of experience
[19:31:26] <coldhead> but try asking your question anyway
[19:31:49] <dragonpiper> i have image data in mysql updated evey second
[19:31:53] <Sempra> I like when people say "ANYONE CAN HELP"
[19:31:59] <dragonpiper> i want to view it in the browser like a gif
[19:32:42] <Sempra> so you need to convert it into a readable format via php and use jquery ajax to update the image every x
[19:32:45] <Sempra> badabing.
[19:33:10] <Sempra> Sounds like a drain of resources though.
[19:33:42] <dragonpiper> pretty much
[19:33:47] <dragonpiper> u know a better way
[19:33:57] <Sempra> Why is the data being loaded into mysql
[19:34:00] <ajpiano> dragonpiper: it's base64 encoded?
[19:34:12] <Sempra> Is this some medical database shit?
[19:34:15] <dragonpiper> no its just the binary of a jpg imag
[19:34:28] <Sempra> heh
[19:34:32] <Sempra> What is the source of the jpeg
[19:34:33] <colin_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnbJq8FgZJA&feature=BFa&list=UUB6lJ8d8-g4g&index=5
[19:34:47] <colin_> oops
[19:34:50] <colin_> wrong paste
[19:34:54] <colin_> ...
[19:34:56] <colin_> i have this drag&drop script: http://jsfiddle.net/z6sYJ/1/
[19:34:56] <colin_> it's working but i want to change/fix some things
[19:34:56] <colin_> 1st i need to make the droppable elements only accept 1 element to be dropped on to them
[19:34:56] <colin_> now it simply disables them, but when you move the dropped item to another container it stays disabled
[19:35:00] <coldhead> lol
[19:35:18] <dragonpiper> its updated every second
[19:35:22] <dragonpiper> from mysql
[19:35:27] <coldhead> Sempra: U CAN HELP? I PM YOU FOR HELP. THANKS FOR HELP
[19:35:30] <dragonpiper> the source ^
[19:35:30] <Sempra> no I mean, where is the source.
[19:35:36] <dragonpiper> mysql
[19:35:40] <Sempra> Where does the image data COME from
[19:35:46] <Sempra> a server generating a map?
[19:35:54] <dragonpiper> x.x
[19:36:05] <Sempra> Ok so data has to get into mysql right
[19:36:08] <dragonpiper> the server takes small screenshot and rights it to a blob
[19:36:13] <dragonpiper> in the mysql database
[19:36:17] <Sempra> ah
[19:36:26] <dragonpiper> now i want to make a webscript to view these images
[19:36:34] <Sempra> Does it save it a as a jpg before encoding it.
[19:36:45] * Sempra thinks it surley does
[19:37:06] <colin_> so can anyone help me with my issues?
[19:37:09] <dragonpiper> x.x
[19:37:24] * Sempra doesn't understand what is so hard.
[19:37:29] <dragonpiper> lets say is in such a format that if u wrote it to a file u would have an image x.x
[19:37:33] <ajpiano> dragonpiper: fwiw, if you have a base64 string, you can use a datauri: http://jsfiddle.net/ZRTVS/
[19:37:38] <Sempra> Ok
[19:37:39] <dragonpiper> not sure what your asking lol
[19:37:48] <joikus> you guys
[19:37:54] <joikus> I was looking at google+ via firebug
[19:37:54] <Sempra> I was trying to simplify your situation
[19:37:59] <joikus> what the f is going on!
[19:38:07] <Sempra> lol
[19:38:08] <dragonpiper> ok what were u saying
[19:38:18] <dragonpiper> if it writes it as a file before displaying it in browser ?
[19:38:44] <ajpiano> dragonpiper: you literally have a string of 001010011 in the db?
[19:38:48] <Sempra> No I mean, the server takes a screenshot. That screenshot is either saved directly to mysql - OR it is saved as a jpeg and encoded after.
[19:39:09] <Sempra> If it is saved as a jpeg and encoded after - it's an easier source to update from than mysql.
[19:39:29] <dragonpiper> ok heres how it works
[19:39:38] <ajpiano> dragonpiper: or do you have base64 encoded binary image data
[19:39:39] <dragonpiper> java programs makes gets a bufferimage
[19:39:46] <dragonpiper> it encodes that in jpg format
[19:39:50] <dragonpiper> and writes it to mysql
[19:40:05] <ajpiano> can you create a paste of what this image data looks like please in the database
[19:40:07] <ajpiano> fixee.org
[19:40:16] <Sempra> Ok so am I stupid?
[19:40:47] <coldhead> bot-t: is Sempra stupid?
[19:40:48] <bot-t> coldhead, My sources say no.
[19:40:58] <coldhead> there you have it
[19:40:59] <dragonpiper> Ã¿ÃÃ¿Ã 
[19:41:04] <Sempra> I'll roll with that.
[19:41:36] <dragonpiper> so.....
[19:42:02] <dragonpiper> how would i display it and have it refresh
[19:42:13] <dragonpiper> if u use headers i have to refresh the page to see an update
[19:42:14] <dragonpiper> i*
[19:43:11] <coldhead> O RLY
[19:44:44] <dragonpiper> z.z
[19:47:20] <scar2> I have a simple javascript function that sets a div from display:none; to show, and i was wondering if it was less effective than jquery? i just worry about browsers that deny javascript... i just seem like using js is oldschool
[19:48:02] <scar2> so when i click a link onClick="function()" it calls the 1 lined function
[19:48:39] <scar2> function postreply() {
[19:48:40] <scar2> 	document.getElementById("postreply").style.display = '';
[19:48:40] <scar2> }
[19:48:41] <scar2> shit
[19:48:43] <misterm_> scar2: jQuery = javascript...if javascript is disabled, so is jquery
[19:48:49] <scar2> ahh!!! i meant to paste the pastebin
[19:49:20] <scar2> misterm_: well now that youve seen my code, is there a better way to do that using jquery? or not worth it ?
[19:49:24] <misterm_> scar2: as to whether you should switch to jQuery, go with what works for you, jQuery certainly makes things easir though
[19:51:29] <scar2> misterm_: is there a simple replacement to my one lined code? or is it like.... lots of lines
[19:53:14] <coldhead> jQUery is write less, do more
[19:53:16] <coldhead> in general
[19:53:27] <misterm_> scar2: in jquery it would be something like $("#linkid").click(function(){ $(this).hide() })
[19:54:01] <misterm_> scar2: or actually $("#postreply").hide() to match your example
[19:56:36] <educr0w> anyone can check http://www.movius.com.ar/work/cart and tell me if is ok? It is simple, it have a function to refresh shopping cart, to add item and remove item in the html
[19:57:38] <scar2> misterm_: how would i hide a class in a simple one-lined jquery? that def would be useful if im having to add jquery to my loadtime.
[19:57:58] <scar2> misterm_: javascript toggle by class is stupid..... lol
[19:58:57] <misterm_> scar2: $(".class").hide()
[19:59:21] <scar2> misterm_: interesting. of course i cant just use THAT line... ? onClick="whatyousaid" ?
[20:00:11] <misterm_> scar2: in both javascript and jquery, you don't want to mix code with your markup
[20:00:25] <misterm_> scar2: in both you want to attach event listeners from your code
[20:00:43] <misterm_> scar2: in jQuery, you do it with .click()
[20:01:10] <misterm_> scar2: $(elementtobeclicked).click(function() { whattodo() })
[20:03:09] <saddishwasher> hi guys
[20:03:24] <misterm_> hullo
[20:10:14] <educr0w> misterm_ if I have a item list generated by php, the list consists on ItemName Add to cart link and Remove from cart link, is possible to attach a generic event to both links?
[20:12:58] <colin_> i have this drag&drop script: http://jsfiddle.net/z6sYJ/1/
[20:12:58] <colin_> it's working but i want to change/fix some things
[20:12:58] <colin_> 1st i need to make the droppable elements only accept 1 element to be dropped on to them
[20:12:58] <colin_> now it simply disables them, but when you move the dropped item to another container it stays disabled
[20:31:37] <colin_> so isn't there anyone experienced with .draggable() and .droppable()?
[20:39:57] <CannedCorn> hey guys is there a plugin that just does thumbnail sliders
[20:40:04] <CannedCorn> i don't have any gallery needs
[20:40:19] <CannedCorn> just like small 30x30 slider where you can select an image from thumbnails
[20:41:47] <|splat|> anyone know a good tutorial for making a "live updating" file reader, or rss reader?
[20:44:32] <olind> hi all
[20:44:55] <olind> can i asked something about jquery treeview?
[20:49:28] <abjorn> woah, just realized you can ctrl+click to select multiple tabs in chrome so you can drag them all to a new window :O
[21:02:05] <danieliser> how can i take a json type string {1:{option:value},2:{option:value}} to an object?
[21:02:17] <ajpiano> ?parseJSON
[21:02:17] <bot-t> jQuery.parseJSON(json): [New in v1.4.1] Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[21:02:21] <ajpiano> but you have to actually have valid json
[21:02:26] <ajpiano> ?g what is valid json
[21:02:27] <coldhead> harsh
[21:02:27] <bot-t> ajpiano, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[21:02:47] <danieliser> thanks.. figured it was something i wasnt getting
[21:04:04] <olind> hi all.. how can jquery treeview for asp classic using database sql server as treeview data?
[21:04:21] <sunscreen> hello all can some one help me with: http://stream.selectukradio.tk/shoutstats-0.8.4/gauges/gt2.php <-- the gauge does not go up to the first value and its smooth but seems to be a little jumpy jumpy
[21:04:29] <colin_> i need to make a .draggable a .droppable after it has been dropped somewhere else
[21:04:55] <ajpiano> $(this).draggable("destroy").droppable();
[21:04:58] <sunscreen> it will smoothly goes to a value then it will jump
[21:05:30] <WarDekar> hmm I'm trying to get Sortable to work with a table, the use-case is I want the user to be able to drag/drop columns via the <thead>
[21:05:55] <colin_> ajpiano i meant the original .draggable, not the new created element
[21:06:07] <WarDekar> doing $("#mytable thead").sortable() just makes it so i can drag the ENTIRE thead around which is not what i want
[21:06:17] <ajpiano> WarDekar: sortable straight up does not work on tables
[21:06:41] <ajpiano> i mean $("#mytable thead th") will let you drag the heading cells... but that's not gonna take you too far
[21:06:43] <WarDekar> ajpiano: oh... would've been nice to know that last night when someone in this room told me to use Sortable lol
[21:07:08] <colin_> and since i have multiple draggables and droppables and draggable afaik does not have a drop event, simply doing $(this) would not work
[21:07:32] <WarDekar> ajpiano: any idea what i could do instead? this seems like it'd be a pretty common use-case someone has to have solved it before
[21:08:08] <ajpiano> colin_ draggable has a stop event
[21:08:30] <ajpiano> and when you drop a draggable into a droppable, you can get access to the draggable that was dropped in the drop callback
[21:08:43] <colin_> yeah but doesn't that also fire if the drop was invalid?
[21:08:49] <ajpiano> WarDekar: i actually don't know of simple column dragging solution off hand
[21:08:53] <ajpiano> i know one for rows
[21:09:26] <WarDekar> yeah columns are more complicated i guess because i do have some columns that span multiple columns
[21:09:26] <ajpiano> ?g jquery isocra tablednd
[21:09:28] <bot-t> ajpiano, Table Drag and Drop JQuery plugin | Isocra - http://www.isocra.com/2008/02/table-drag-and-drop-jquery-plugin/
[21:09:33] <ajpiano> you might be able to steal the technique
[21:09:40] <ajpiano> which doesn't really ever move the rows around in space
[21:09:45] <WarDekar> but i also have all the columns that need to be dragged sharing a class
[21:10:02] <ajpiano> but rather just track the mouse on mouseDown and see if it moves past where the next row starts, and then swaps them if that's the case
[21:10:29] <danieliser> ajpiana: thanks.. fixed the formatting and worked like a charm..
[21:10:43] <ajpiano> WarDekar: i think some of the bigger grids also have draggable cols in them
[21:10:44] <WarDekar> ajpiano: that could probably work for columns as well
[21:11:08] <ajpiano> WarDekar: yeah, getting the right cells will be a bit of a pita if there's colspans but, having used the rows thing in practise
[21:11:13] <ajpiano> it seems to be a sound approach
[21:11:30] <ajpiano> the plan is to get draggable and droppable working on tables at some point, but that point ain't happened
[21:11:49] <WarDekar> weird cause this seems like it should be a very common thing people would want
[21:12:23] <colin_> ajpiano so how would i detect a valid drop in the stop event and make the draggable a droppable?
[21:12:42] <ajpiano> WarDekar: i'm not saying there isn't one out there, i just don't know of one off hand
[21:12:48] <ajpiano> defintiely google around abit
[21:14:00] <WarDekar> i found this the other night: http://akottr.de/dragtable/
[21:14:04] <WarDekar> but was having issues
[21:14:12] <WarDekar> having colspans fucks it up i think
[21:20:49] <lith> Hey is there an array function that returns the index of an object that matches what i send it?
[21:21:17] <WarDekar> i guess the trick is to just modify the code and move the columns to the right for however many colspan it is
[21:22:40] <WarDekar> doubt i'm good enough with javascript to do that modification though :9
[21:22:41] <WarDekar> :(
[21:23:19] <sunscreen> any one ??
[21:24:46] <colin_> ajpiano?
[21:25:05] <ajpiano> colin_ you should use the drop event
[21:25:09] <ajpiano> and check the draggable
[21:25:14] <ajpiano> it's provided in the ui argument to the event
[21:25:18] <ajpiano> i'm playing scrable tcan't talk
[21:30:31] <|splat|> http://jsfiddle.net/sweetbrett/6wDLD/ so i've got this basic interval setup to refresh a data source. when the data has a new <li>, how can i add the effect of inserting it at the top and sliding everything else down?
[21:37:24] <aaairc> would anyone know how to make the cell with the text "Mauris ultricies fringilla portiror...." shown here http://oi54.tinypic.com/dompeh.jpg drop below the image... so basically clear:left... i would be doing this because i don't want all that white space.
[21:37:34] <aaairc> here is the jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/aaairc/hJbbT/12/
[21:38:15] <aaairc> i don't know which cell will be the one though that will need the clear:left. img size and cell sizes are going to be variable...
[21:40:16] <aaairc> would the only way to do that be with jquery... like check the cell positions?
[21:42:16] * coldhead np: fugazi - break
[21:44:07] <zivester>  aaairc: remove the min-width and the overflow hidden... u'll have to get more fancy with the paddings/borders
[21:44:12] <zivester> but it will wrap
[21:45:40] <eddiemonge> aaairc: lol why did you link to an image of the fiddle instead of to the fiddle itself?
[21:45:44] <aaairc> zivester: the thing is that I want each cell to have a border/background... so if i get rid of overflow:hidden the background/border of the cell will stretch below the floated img
[21:46:16] <aaairc> eddiemonge: i also gave the fiddle... the reason is because depending on your screen resolution the cell that wraps would change and my explanation would be less clear
[21:46:39] <aaairc> eddiemonge: or it would have been harder to describe the behavior i wanted
[21:46:57] <zivester> well u want the text to wrap... but u also want to be able to style it... i dont know of a way to do this with on element
[21:47:43] <aaairc> zivester: in terms of wrapping... i basically don't want it to wrap. i either want the cell pushed to the right or to drop below the img. its just if its pushed to the right, i want the bottom of the cell not to go beyond the bottom of the image
[21:47:51] <aaairc> zivester: if that makes sense.
[21:48:29] <aaairc> like the "Mauris" cell should just drop below the img
[21:48:40] <daleharvey> anyone familiar with flot?
[21:49:07] <daleharvey> img gonna assume theres a better way to write http://pastebin.me/74fc57b4f094813151564c8ca04d50bf
[21:49:09] <zivester> and you can't just place it like the cells under it already ?
[21:49:34] <zivester> ur going to have this empty space, either below the image, or under the google maps one
[21:50:52] <aaairc> i would prefer the empty space below the google Maps
[21:50:58] <educr0w> aaairc: clear both does not work ?
[21:51:08] <educr0w> in mauris cell only
[21:51:11] <zivester> so just clear:both on your cells?
[21:51:37] <aaairc> zivester: the thing is the img that is floated is going to be a lot of different heights... so it may be the mauris cell that needs the clear:left... it may be the next cell below it... or it may turn out all the cells will fit to the right of the img
[21:52:35] <aaairc> i think i have to check the position of the cells with jquery... and apply a clear:left after html.css has done all the positioning
[21:52:52] <aaairc> i was hoping that there was a pure html/css solution though
[21:52:56] <educr0w> aaairc: http://jsfiddle.net/hJbbT/13/ but like zivester saids, map cell keeps small
[21:54:25] <aaairc> educr0w: cool thanks. the thing is though, if the mauris cell ends up being smaller... or the img taller... so that the mauris cell can fit entirely to the right of the img without being pushed below it... then i wouldn't want the clear:both on it
[21:54:41] <aaairc> like the img height / cell height is going to be dynamic
[21:56:12] <educr0w> ohh I understand now
[21:56:43] <aaairc> educr0w: cell sorry if my explanation was difficult to understand at first. it was hard for me to describe the exact behavior i wanted.
[21:56:56] <aaairc> *cool
[21:57:01] <zivester> http://jsfiddle.net/hJbbT/14/
[21:57:10] <zivester> something like that ?
[21:57:17] <educr0w> I don't speak english very well..that is a problem too lol
[21:58:44] <educr0w> zivester: he wants..if the height of mauris cell fits between cell map and bottom of the image..the mauris cell keeps under map cell..then..if mauris cell is biger..it clear both
[21:59:05] <aaairc> exactly
[21:59:17] <aaairc> and the same for every cell after the Mauris cell
[21:59:31] <aaairc> if i have an img with height 2000px or something... everything should just be to the right of it
[21:59:44] <zivester> so no wrapping ever, ok
[22:01:24] <educr0w> something like this with each cell: if (height of img - (height of title + height of map)) >= mauris cell height then.. mauris under map cell.. else.. mauris clear both
[22:01:43] <zivester> ya i dont really understand this void that will be created doing it that way (which will probably need firefox)
[22:02:11] <zivester> s/firebug/javascript/
[22:03:16] <aaairc> zivester: your saying you think it will look bad?
[22:04:05] <zivester> hard to say with juts the mockup... or how important this content is around the promo
[22:05:08] <educr0w> aaairc: with height() you can get a div height
[22:05:17] <zivester> seems like all the copy could always go below th promo... and that spaced on the right could be used for something else with a little bit more size constraint
[22:05:53] <educr0w> for example.. <div id='imagecontainer'><img.../></div>, you can do $('#imagecontainer').height() to get the height value
[22:06:13] <aaairc> so something like this:  http://jsfiddle.net/aaairc/hJbbT/15/
[22:06:25] <aaairc> educr0w: ^
[22:06:50] <aaairc> this would be the only way to do it then right? checking the height of each cell with jquery?
[22:06:54] <aaairc> no way to do it just with html / css?
[22:07:28] <educr0w> I think so
[22:09:14] <zivester> ya no real way witout the way he created... i frankly think those will be a headache and more ugly... something to be said for keeping flow, espcially if this is an article or somethinhg
[22:10:31] <aaairc> zivester: ideally i would like it to wrap, but then i would need to get rid of the borders of my cells i think
[22:11:29] <aaairc> and for styling it looks nicer with each cell having a border/background
[22:12:12] <zivester> http://jsfiddle.net/hJbbT/17/
[22:12:30] <zivester> im sure that can be played with and made pretty with miminal effort
[22:12:58] <aaairc> zivester: the blue background and white border of the cells stretch underneath the img in that example which i don't think it looks nice
[22:13:17] <aaairc> and the background of the body is actually going to be a img not just a color
[22:13:40] <aaairc> so i cant just use a border on the img to erase the background of the cells that is stretching under the img
[22:13:47] <aaairc> like i know of no way to do that
[22:13:57] <aaairc> another complication is that i'm actually doing rounded borders on my cells
[22:14:06] <aaairc> if you do, that would be awesome
[22:15:11] <educr0w> if you use solid background you can do something like this http://jsfiddle.net/hJbbT/18/
[22:15:29] <educr0w> but if you are going to use an image..doesn't works
[22:15:42] <aaairc> educr0w: yeah
[22:16:07] <aaairc> unfortunately i wanted to use an image ad the background...
[22:19:11] <zivester> http://jsfiddle.net/hJbbT/21/
[22:20:53] <aaairc> zivester: ahh that would be good... but my background of the page is actually going to be an img... not a color, so i don't think i can do that
[22:21:20] <zivester> u can do anything in html/css with enough elements :)
[22:21:48] <m0dmd> anyone have example sites whereas the navigation is fixed and sticks to containers as the page scrolls?
[22:22:22] <m0dmd> like long pages with anchors
[22:22:33] <neeku> hi folks
[22:22:44] <m0dmd> sup neeku
[22:23:24] <neeku> i've asked this in #web and #wordpress several times, but got no help. i've followed this: http://digwp.com/2009/06/including-jquery-in-wordpress-the-right-way/ and now i want to have some on mouse over event like this : http://www.dreamerlines.lv/ in my site
[22:23:26] <m0dmd> anyone know that jquery functionality or no
[22:23:29] <neeku> could you please help?
[22:24:42] <aaairc> zivester: could i? so all my content is going to be in a div that is going to be centered... and then the background img of the page is going to be an img... not a color... so somehow i would need to replicate the page background img within the flyer img background
[22:25:21] <zivester> i'd need to see an example fiddle and/or the desired effect
[22:27:47] <educr0w> now is time of my problem lol, I have a item list generated by php, the list consists on ItemName - Add to cart link - Remove from cart link. Now I have an onclick function like addToCart(itemID) and removeFromCart(itemID), is possible to attach a generic click event to both links? that works like the function
[22:33:10] * zivester away
[22:36:08] <aaairc> zivester: it would be something like this http://jsfiddle.net/aaairc/hJbbT/26/
[22:36:32] <thatryan> Trying to figure out why something is broken, so including the un minified source and setting breakpoint, it is stopping on this,

[22:36:41] <thatryan> damn smily!
[22:36:47] <thatryan> matches.call( document.documentElement, "[test!=''] : sizzle" );
[22:37:02] <thatryan> what is happening in that statement?
[22:44:37] <bdi> hi
[22:45:20] <cypha> hi
[23:04:18] <krz> anyone use tag-it and know how to get it to work with an ajax source?
[23:10:05] <coldhead> goodnight computer
[23:12:27] <krz> this is what i have so far: https://github.com/aehlke/tag-it/issues/13
[23:21:07] <aaairc> does jquery have a built in function if i want to do a loop that repeats every second until a condition is met and i break the loop?
[23:22:50] <Mrfloyd> heyy
[23:22:57] <aaairc> basically the img.load() function isn't working for me in chrome, some i'm going to do a loop to check $('img').get(0).complete ... until its true
[23:23:10] <Mrfloyd> try the native js
[23:23:23] <aaairc> Mrfloyd: talking to me?
[23:23:23] <Mrfloyd> aaairc: setInterval
[23:23:27] <Mrfloyd> yes
[23:23:56] <Mrfloyd> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp
[23:24:14] <aaairc> Mrfloyd: checking it out
[23:24:27] <Mrfloyd> var timer = setInterval ...
[23:24:34] <Mrfloyd> and u can clearInterval
[23:24:49] <Mrfloyd> simple
[23:24:52] <aaairc> awesome
[23:24:56] <aaairc> in the example i see this var int=self.setInterval("clock()",1000);
[23:25:00] <aaairc> what is the 'self"
[23:25:04] <aaairc> 'self'
[23:25:17] <aaairc> do i need to call it on a certain object? or can i just do setInterval() by itself
[23:25:50] <Cork> ?w3schools

[23:26:18] <Mrfloyd> Cork: ??
[23:26:21] <Mrfloyd> what does this mean
[23:26:23] <Mrfloyd> :^
[23:26:45] <Cork> Mrfloyd: that you should never link to w3schools, they are terrible source of information
[23:26:56] <Mrfloyd> looool
[23:27:00] <Mrfloyd> i just got u
[23:27:01] <Mrfloyd> hahaha
[23:27:03] <Mrfloyd> agree
[23:27:06] <Cork> Mrfloyd: from javascirpt "<jsBot> w3schools: Errors, omissions, deceit.  They are NOT (despite their name) related to the W3C. Their code contains deprecated code, bad methodologies,"
[23:27:11] <Mrfloyd> i just pasted the first link
[23:27:32] <Mrfloyd> true true truw
[23:27:43] <Cork> aaairc: setInterval and setTimeout is functions that will return a handle to its timer
[23:27:56] <Mrfloyd> not to mention it is aspx
[23:27:58] <Cork> aaairc: you can call it without relation to dom or objects
[23:27:59] <Mrfloyd> hahahah
[23:28:12] <Cork> aaairc: it needs you to pass a function though
[23:28:20] <Cork> ?mdc setInterval @ aaairc
[23:28:21] <bot-t> aaairc, window.setInterval - MDN Docs - Calls a function repeatedly, with a fixed time delay between each call to that function. https://developer.mozilla.org/En/window.setInterval
[23:28:39] <Cork> Mrfloyd: so if you want doc links use ?mdc

[23:31:30] <Mrfloyd> i read this thread before
[23:31:31] <Cork> cypha: not on your localhost :)

[23:38:35] <aximilation> ;-)
[23:38:37] * neeku is sorry for the wrong paste
[23:38:58] <aximilation> I thought it looksed a bit too round, couldn't resist the generalization though :D
[23:39:07] <aaairc> cracked me up

[23:39:59] <colin_> so there isn't a word for Data Mining in persian?
[23:40:15] <neeku> i want something like this on mouse event : http://www.dreamerlines.lv/ for my wordpress site, and i've followed this: http://digwp.com/2009/06/including-jquery-in-wordpress-the-right-way/  what should i do next? i need some help which i couldn't find in #wordpress nor #web
[23:40:37] <Mrfloyd> neeku:
[23:40:42] <Mrfloyd> 3arabi?
[23:41:12] <neeku> Mrfloyd: i already said that i'm sorry for the wrong paste caused by my typing program. it's NOT arabic, it's Persian.
[23:41:31] <Mrfloyd> i speak  arabic
[23:41:33] <cypha> popup.js is the file with the script
[23:41:33] <coldhead> they are the same thing
[23:41:34] <Mrfloyd> no worries
[23:41:48] <neeku> so you can recognize it's not arabic Mrfloyd !
[23:41:57] <cypha> http://69.84.109.187:6543/login
[23:42:03] <Mrfloyd> it is
[23:42:05] <neeku> and i'm here  for some jquery help only
[23:42:05] <aximilation> What does it say? It looks like some sort of reference to a coding job listing or something
[23:42:08] <Mrfloyd> some stuff are arabic
[23:42:21] <aaairc> neeku: stop spreading your hate speech in here
[23:42:33] <coldhead> lol
[23:42:42] <neeku> persian does include arabic words, same as english includes french!
[23:42:51] <Mrfloyd> alright
[23:42:57] <aximilation> english is the bastard child of the globe :D
[23:42:59] <neeku> google translate would help you if you're really into that piece of text!\
[23:43:01] <Mrfloyd> go ahead
[23:43:02] <coldhead> you know who else hates speech? stephen hawking
[23:43:06] <Mrfloyd> dig into js now
[23:43:07] <Mrfloyd> :P;p
[23:43:08] <Mrfloyd> :P
[23:43:11] <neeku> but i'm not here for off topic.
[23:43:17] <coldhead> yes you are
[23:43:20] <aximilation> google translate gives something pretty rough
[23:43:23] <cypha> clicking the modal window link takes you to #dialog but there's no popup

[23:43:36] <wwalser> neeku: Do you have specific questions about mouseover?
[23:43:51] <cypha> any help would be much appreciated
[23:44:28] <neeku> wwalser: it's been ages since i knew a bit of html and js. so i don't remember anything from codes for now, but i want to have that sort of mouse over in my site. i don't know how to do that.
[23:44:41] <Atilla6> Enter text here...
[23:44:47] <aximilation> cypha: looking at your code...

[23:45:08] <ProLoser|Work> hi
[23:45:26] <cypha> thanks aximilation
[23:45:42] <aximilation> fyi cypha, what I normally do is put all of that in a function and add an onclick/return false to the link
[23:45:51] <wwalser> I haven't read the code for the site you linked, but you could probably do something really simple like giving all of the links that need to be highlighted on mouseover a class then on mouseover of foo, find all links that share a class with foo and highlight them as well.
[23:46:35] <neeku> hmm...
[23:46:36] <cypha> aximilation: add the whole script as a single function?
[23:46:37] * neeku checks
[23:46:41] <aximilation> cypha: I'm no expert either, but have you considered using something like the jquery colorbox extensions
[23:46:49] <aximilation> extension*   And yes
[23:46:53] <cypha> aximilation: i'm using jquery
[23:46:54] <wwalser> a class is probably the wrong way to do it honestly, the highlight should probably be a class, but for finding other things that need to be highlighted should probably use data attributes
[23:47:04] <aximilation> IM it makes it simpler to debug with firebug
[23:47:07] <cypha> and this is so simple, I can't believe i can't get it to work
[23:47:20] <cypha> there's hardly any code
[23:47:33] <aximilation> as-is there is no error or anything, so I dunno what to think
[23:47:53] <cypha> aximilation: can you see the popup.js file?
[23:48:07] <aximilation> yes I was looking at it
[23:48:19] <cypha> i copied it exactly
[23:48:32] <cypha> could it be that it isn't finding jquery.js?
[23:49:00] <aximilation> I added onclick="return false;" so it doesn't change location, but still no js seems to happen
[23:49:55] <cypha> aximilation: how does that script get activated to run?
[23:50:18] <cypha> just by loading the login page?
[23:50:28] <aximilation> jquery is loaded as verified by firebug
[23:50:32] <cypha> /login
[23:50:42] <cypha> oh
[23:52:01] <cypha> aximilation: where does the code in part 4 go?
[23:52:03] <cypha> http://www.queness.com/post/77/simple-jquery-modal-window-tutorial
[23:52:15] <cypha> i never entered that part in, could explain everything
[23:52:41] <Samian> is it possible to use my own smtp server for sending mail with my gmail email address as the sender, without the email automatically being put in the spam folder?
[23:53:55] <djQuery1> cypha: got an even easier modal window $('#mydiv').dialog({modal: true});
[23:54:03] <djQuery1> cypha: see ?ui.dialog
[23:54:03] <bot-t> cypha, A dialog is a floating window that contains a title bar and a content area. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with the 'x' icon by default. http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[23:54:21] <Cork> Samian: i fail to see how that has anything to do with jquery
[23:55:13] <Samian> sorry I was taking advantage of the fact that this channel has like a thousand people in it and hoping that one of you guys would have a suggestion
[23:55:48] <coldhead> it was worth a shot, Samian
[23:55:54] <coldhead> jQuery is your mechanical turk
[23:56:13] <cypha> djQuery1: <script type="text/javascript"> $('#mydiv').dialog({modal: true});
[23:56:14] <cypha> </script>
[23:56:38] <cypha> djQuery1: now how do I create a link that uses that?
[23:57:02] <djQuery1> cypha: see ?jqf
[23:57:03] <bot-t> cypha, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[23:57:25] <cypha> djQuery1: got any learn by doing books?
[23:57:42] <aximilation> cypha: I ran into issues when manually running this:         var maskHeight = $(document).height(); var maskWidth = $(window).width();
[23:57:44] <djQuery1> $('#mylinkbutton').click(function(){$('#mydiv').dialog({modal: true}); });
[23:57:47] <coldhead> i'm going to check that book out after my first proper day of jQuery
[23:57:56] <djQuery1> cypha: why yes I have
[23:58:25] <djQuery1> coldhead: that book has gotten me doing so much after my first day of jquery
[23:58:31] <cypha> aximilation: not sure why, jquery is loaded
[23:59:28] <djQuery1> cypha: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal-form
[23:59:47] <aximilation> sorry, scratch that, ran in the wrong tab
