[00:29:59] <dormancy_>  hi , how jquery achieve cors in ie6 or ie7
[00:32:44] <coldhead> dormancy_: To enable cross-domain requests in environments that do not support cors yet but do allow cross-domain XHR requests (windows gadget, etc), set $.support.cors = true;
[00:32:58] <coldhead> "BUT DO ALLOW CROSS-DOMAIN XHR"
[00:33:02] <coldhead> ie 6 & 7 do not
[00:33:06] <coldhead> case closed
[00:35:35] <dormancy_> but in ie6 or 7 I can corss-domain though jquery "jquery.support.cors = true" ,how it do it
[00:35:45] <dormancy_> ?
[00:36:24] <dormancy_> and it can throught post of ajax
[00:40:19] <coldhead> dormancy_: i just quoted the part of the documentation which explains why it doesn't work in IE 6 & 7
[00:40:31] <coldhead> maybe if i paste it again in caps?
[00:40:42] <coldhead> DORMANCY_: TO ENABLE CROSS-DOMAIN REQUESTS IN ENVIRONMENTS THAT DO NOT SUPPORT CORS YET BUT DO ALLOW CROSS-DOMAIN XHR REQUESTS (WINDOWS GADGET, ETC), set $.support.cors = true;
[00:41:46] <dormancy_> <coldhead> thanks
[00:42:04] <dormancy_> coldhead:thanks
[00:42:11] <coldhead> YOU ARE WELCOME!
[00:42:41] <blackspotwiggins> coldhead, how do i computer? with ie5.5?
[00:44:18] <coldhead> if only i had the energy to kick you, wiggins
[00:44:28] <coldhead> the energy and the operator status
[00:44:30] <coldhead> but alas
[00:44:49] * tw2113 kicks blackspotwiggins anyway
[00:45:28] <blackspotwiggins> nah
[00:45:33] <blackspotwiggins> you know you love me
[00:48:01] <Helbom> hello
[00:49:13] <Helbom> i'm new to jQuery and I'm struggling with a select. When I try to change the selected value with jQuery the displayed value is not changed, but when I expand the combo the correct option is highilighted
[00:49:51] <Helbom> $('#call-form select[name=client] option[value=' + clientId + ']').attr('selected', 'selected');
[00:50:14] <blackspotwiggins> Helbom, use prop()
[00:50:20] <blackspotwiggins> or val() on the select
[00:50:57] <Helbom> i tried with val as well
[00:51:08] <Helbom> going to try the prop now
[00:51:47] <coldhead> good luck
[00:54:35] <batdorf> odd question... is there a way to e.preventDefault, store the default events, then call them later on condition?
[01:00:48] <batdorf> maybe I can store e and then some how call it back
[01:06:24] <strathmeyer> Helbom: what you want to do
[01:06:28] <Helbom> blackspotwiggins: no luck with the prop.. the text still remains previously selected
[01:06:45] <strathmeyer> is instead do $('#call-form select[name=client]').val(clientId)
[01:06:51] <strathmeyer> that will set the value on the SELECT
[01:06:56] <strathmeyer> selecting the correct option.
[01:07:16] <Helbom> I have 2 select's. the options of the 2nd select is based on the selection of the first
[01:07:49] <strathmeyer> ah.
[01:07:55] <strathmeyer> that wasn't mentioned in your original question.
[01:08:08] <Helbom> but the displayed value of the 2nd select always remains the same (previous selected), but the value is changed
[01:08:31] <Helbom> strathmeyer: sorry for bad explination :/
[01:08:36] <strathmeyer> no worries!
[01:08:49] <strathmeyer> It sounds like you're trying to get some slightly complicated behavior.
[01:09:01] <strathmeyer> The best thing to do in situations like this is to create a jsfiddle that shows the problem.
[01:09:15] <Helbom> $('select[name=client-contacts] option').first().prop('selected', true); i tried this
[01:09:26] <strathmeyer> I really think you want .val()
[01:10:04] <strathmeyer> but, again, the best think you can do is create a jsfiddle to show your problem. (since describing programming problems is always difficult, showing is best)
[01:10:17] <Helbom> strathmeyer: i've tried that as well .val()
[01:10:21] <strathmeyer> go to http://jsfiddle.net/ and you can add JS and HTML.  (in the upper left, select "onLoad", and "jQuery" from the drop downs.
[01:10:45] <radiodario> jsfiddle ftw
[01:10:47] <strathmeyer> if you have "onLoad" selected in the top drop down, that means you don't' even have to wrap your code in $(function () {   /* your code here */ })
[01:11:10] <strathmeyer> you just write your code, and jsFiddle will automatically wrap it in an onReady (aka onLoad) block.
[01:12:03] <strathmeyer> I actually need to go to sleep :(   but if you create a JS fiddle showing your problem, then it will be much easier for people to help you with the solution.
[01:12:24] <radiodario> Helbom: put in on a jsfiddle and i'll have a look
[01:12:39] <strathmeyer> If you can't find an answer to your jsfiddle in this chat room, also try posting on stackoverflow.com (with a link to your jsfiddle), tag your question with 'jquery'
[01:12:48] <strathmeyer> awesome! thanks radiodario!
[01:13:15] <Helbom> thanks for the help so far folks :) really appreciated
[01:13:15] <klj613> good morning. if i have a collection of items (e.g. foo[customers][0][name] etc). and i end up with only the indexes 0 1 2 5 (3 and 4 was removed). how would i go about sorting out the indexes/keys?
[01:13:21] <Helbom> setting up the jsfiddle now
[01:13:27] <strathmeyer> good luck, Helbom!
[01:13:37] * strathmeyer waves goodbye.
[01:13:56] <radiodario> night!
[01:14:34] <radiodario> klj613: iterate over the array and push the items into a new array?
[01:16:26] <klj613> each field got id like foo_bar_0_id foo_bar_1_id and name as foo[bar][0][id]. not sure how to replace the numbers accurately (e.g. if i have foo[bar][0][baz][2][name] in the future
[01:17:26] <tocka> How can I print json object data in jQuery? I know that I need to use $.getJSON, but I have no clue how to get it from that object
[01:18:07] <radiodario> ok it was quite confusing i thought you were addressing an array (that's what square braces do)
[01:18:33] <radiodario> klj613: can you pastebin your code? you might wanna use a regexp?
[01:18:46] <radiodario> tocka: print to the console? or you mean query for json?
[01:19:16] <tocka> print to console
[01:19:18] <tocka> :/
[01:19:25] <tocka> i know that I need to do console.log
[01:19:43] <tocka> but the thing is I'm not getting how to pull all the data from that object
[01:19:49] <radiodario> $.getJson(urlofyourjson, function(dataReturned) { console.log(datareturned) });
[01:20:01] <radiodario> which object?
[01:20:55] <tocka> never mind
[01:20:58] <tocka> got confused ;)
[01:21:00] <tocka> thanks!
[01:21:06] <radiodario> read this
[01:21:07] <radiodario> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[01:21:44] <radiodario> you could also do $.getJson(url, console.log)
[01:21:50] <radiodario> but the above is nicer
[01:22:20] <Christer_> Hi all, iknow this might be abit out of this channels topic - but i was hoping one of your clever minds might have a clue/tip. Is there any PDF webviewer for ipad/iPhone that will open the PDF on the website itself instead of downloading it?
[01:24:16] <juha_> nope
[01:24:28] <juha_> Christer_: convert the pdf to html if you want to read it on safari?
[01:24:49] <icjs> Christer_, chrome can be configured for that (it does so by default it think) http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/mobile/ios.html
[01:26:34] <Christer_> yeah, but its for a client project - wouldnt want every visitor to download and use chrome instead. :p
[01:26:41] <Helbom> radiodario: http://jsfiddle.net/xSYRL/3/ i'm struggling :P tried to convert it from ajax to static
[01:27:07] <Trisox> any one knows wy swiping and cloned content doesnt work?
[01:28:35] <tocka> radiodario, sorry to bother, all the data is within an object
[01:28:43] <tocka> var data = [ { DATA } ]
[01:28:51] <icjs> Christer_, dunno then sorry. i'm an android user :)
[01:28:57] <tocka> how should I target or something that it would be pulled from there
[01:28:57] <tocka> ?
[01:31:57] <blackspotwiggins> Christer_, https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js maybe?
[01:33:01] <seutje> Helbom: the datatype of id is string, you're only trying to match it with numbers
[01:33:25] <seutje> Helbom: your switch case doesn't actually do anything, so data remains undefines and $.each throws an error on length of undefined
[01:34:25] <Helbom> isn't this typical... I got it to work perfectly on jsfiddle
[01:34:37] <Helbom> but in my project it's not selecting the first value
[01:35:00] <seutje> Helbom: http://jsfiddle.net/xSYRL/13/
[01:35:13] <seutje> or I suppose you could parseInt, but that seems less performant
[01:37:27] <Helbom> yeah I got it working there.. but i'm starting to think it has something to do with the design
[01:38:24] <blackspotwiggins> Helbom, if you are using some fancy plugin for styling selects, there might be an issue there
[01:38:40] <Helbom> yeah
[01:39:51] <prs> http://wklej.org/id/812634/ « I've got the autocompletion from jqueryui, and I would like to display one value on the textinput while on select puting the other one (an ID) into a hidden field. And this code does that fine, but... When I use arrow keys to navigate the autocompletion menu, it sort of "previews" the value in the field, which in this case is item.value instead of item.label
[01:39:57] <prs> Any idea how can I change that?
[01:42:46] <blackspotwiggins> Helbom, there might be an event you can trigger that updates the fancyness
[01:43:23] <Helbom> yeah I will dig a bit deeper
[01:43:34] <Helbom> thanks for the help so far guys
[01:43:46] <blackspotwiggins> check the plugin documentation
[01:48:15] <tocka> How can I read data from this http://pastebin.com/2jkNhjGJ ?
[01:48:53] <Clex> tocka: data[0].id
[01:49:05] <tocka> should I use getJson ?
[01:49:26] <Clex> Nope. You have a JavaScript hash, that's fine.
[01:50:33] <tocka> Clex so how should I get this thing into a loop?
[01:51:03] <Clex> What do you want to do?
[01:51:32] <tocka> Basically get all the values, this array is in a file.
[01:51:40] <tocka> So my problem is getting the info out
[01:51:46] <Clex> for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) { alert(data[i].name); }
[01:52:01] <Clex> This will popup you all the names.
[01:52:23] <shiftingcontrol> I have list of <a id="here"></a>, <a id="next"></a><a id="here"></a>, when I do $("#here").click(code here), only first id="here" is captured, subsequent aren't ,
[01:52:42] <Clex> shiftingcontrol: an id is unique. Use a class.
[01:52:59] <tocka> Clex, strangest thing for me is if I'm not including the file anywhere how should it get the data? Or should I include it? O_o
[01:53:04] <tocka> I'm so confused right now
[01:53:11] <shiftingcontrol> Clex, ok, thanks
[01:53:13] <fdv> Hi folks, I have an issue with adding a jquery object (say, $foo) with registered click handlers and such to a DataTables column. If I add $foo.html() to the data set given to fnAddData(), the handlers will be gone, if I add $foo, all that will show in the table is something along the lines of '[Object object]'. Does anybody know of a way to avoid adding an id field to the html and later looking it up and registering click handlers?
[01:54:04] <Clex> tocka: I really don't get what you want to do.
[01:54:16] <shiftingcontrol> Clex, that works thanks
[01:54:24] <Clex> shiftingcontrol: you're welcome.
[01:54:38] <tocka> Clex, never mind, thanks for the help! :)
[01:54:48] <haizum_> i just spent hours trying to upgrade to android jellybean and finally just discovered that i could just apply the factory update that google just released last week
[01:54:50] <haizum_> facepalm
[01:55:13] <haizum_> err, factory image
[01:55:19] <L1> I need to use the UI Datepicker .getDate() method - I can't seem to reference the datepicker object though. I init with: $('#myDatePickerDiv').datePicker({....}), but when I try $('#myDatePickerDiv').getDate() I get [object Object] has no method getDate
[01:55:29] <Clex> fdv: I think you have to reset handlers after modifying your DOM.
[01:56:08] <fdv> Clex: but $('#bar').append($foo) will retain them, won't it?
[01:56:34] <fdv> (given that e.g. <div id="bar"></div> is already in there)
[01:57:09] <Clex> fdv: I guess it should.
[01:57:43] <Clex> L1: try $('#myDatePickerDiv').datePicker('getDate')
[01:57:52] <amcsi_work> hello
[01:58:21] <amcsi_work> is there a simple way of getting a deferred object of when multiple elements fading with .fadeTo() complete?
[01:58:34] <L1> Clex: "TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'datePicker'"   - this elemnt has the "hasDatepicker" class, so it's definitely the correct element
[01:58:59] <seutje> the datepicker is a lie
[01:59:20] <r500> how do i check if  margin-left of a div is grater than 0px using jquery
[01:59:22] <r500> ?
[01:59:24] <Clex> L1: so why can you write $('#myDatePickerDiv').datePicker({....})?
[01:59:35] <Clex> It's the exact same selector and the exact same method.
[01:59:44] <L1> Clex: that's how im initialising the datepicker on the page
[02:00:16] <L1> Oh, I see what you mean
[02:00:21] <seutje> r500: parseInt($('div').css('margin-left'), 10)
[02:00:34] <r500> seutje: hi :)
[02:00:43] <seutje> uhm, hi o.O
[02:01:07] <L1> Clex: got it. It's not capitalised. ".datepicker" works, but ".datePicker" doesnt
[02:01:14] <L1> Thanks for your help :)
[02:03:48] <sicp> what
[02:03:54] <sicp> what's THIS thing called? https://dl.dropbox.com/u/19390574/amazon_pic.png
[02:04:28] <Clex> sicp: a div with a border?
[02:04:40] <sicp> I drew that around it to bring attention to it
[02:04:49] <sicp> I am talking about the slider-like thing
[02:04:50] <Clex> Well I guess it's a bag then.
[02:04:55] <sicp> smartass
[02:05:10] <Clex> Oh, it's like an image gallery.
[02:05:14] <sicp> haha
[02:05:18] <sicp> argh.
[02:05:44] <sicp> a slideshow of some sort
[02:05:49] <Clex> Yup.
[02:06:01] <sicp> but I want to be able to have it touch-enabled and on the mobile
[02:06:08] <sicp> is there just some..stock name for it?
[02:06:14] <moijk> there are probably some nut who have given that a particular name.
[02:06:21] <sicp> definitely
[02:06:25] <sicp> that's what I'm looking for
[02:06:30] <sicp> touch enabled slideshow
[02:06:32] <sicp> maybe
[02:06:36] <r500> hey thanks again :)
[02:06:44] <r500> seutje:

[02:08:21] <gensym> hi! how do i select all elements containing (not equal) an speciific id?
[02:08:46] <blackspotwiggins> :contains(:not(#id)) ?
[02:08:54] <blackspotwiggins> or :has() rather
[02:09:12] <gensym> in a sense of substring
[02:09:37] <Mithaldu> he wants those with an id containing a substring
[02:09:55] <Clex> gensym: related objects are supposed to share a class.
[02:10:26] <Mithaldu> his software is fucked by people who he cannot control
[02:10:47] <Christer_> any recommended browser detection scripts ?
[02:11:54] <Kambfhase> isn't the recommended way to detect browsers, to not do it and detect features instead?
[02:12:24] <Clex> Kambfhase: maybe he just wants to make fun of IE users.
[02:12:32] <Kambfhase> oh, thats legit
[02:13:37] <Christer_> Trying to come up with a mobile detector. to check and see if the user is on an iPhone/iPad device
[02:13:50] <Helbom> blackspotwiggins: I solved it after some closer inspection.. there are some extra stuff being added to the code
[02:14:16] <Helbom> so to get the new value to display correctly i had to use $('p[name=client-contacts] span').html($('select[name=client-contacts] option[value=0]').html());
[02:14:28] <Kambfhase> Christer_: why would you want to know that?
[02:14:29] <Helbom> there's probably a more optimal solution, but it works
[02:16:33] <Christer_> Kambfhase: to see if i can display a document viewer with flash, or if i just need to provide the PDF file instead.
[02:16:44] <Mithaldu> as for the previous id question
[02:16:46] <Mithaldu> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[02:17:04] <Mithaldu> ^- how does the selector for this need to be formatted to query the id of elements?
[02:17:06] <Kambfhase> Christer_:  You are doing it wrong
[02:17:23] <Christer_> Kambfhase: whats your recommended way of doing it then ?
[02:17:26] <Kambfhase> Christer_: check if flash is available and if not provide the PDF
[02:17:39] <Christer_> ah - thats a nice spin to it.
[02:18:27] <Kambfhase> Feature detection, thats how the pros do it ;)
[02:18:49] <tocka> What could be the problem? If i enter number bigger than stock (below input field) in the first input I get an error as it should be, but when I try to do the same thing to others, I don't get an error.
[02:18:51] <tocka> I just don't get it
[02:19:09] <Christer_> Kambfhase: Yeah nice - Any good read-up on that, havent done it before.
[02:19:46] <Kambfhase> No, sorry, you gotta google that
[02:20:01] <Christer_> found a jq plugin for that
[02:21:54] <Mithaldu> ps: thank you #jquery for being supremely useless as ever, even when confronted with very detailed information
[02:26:19] <batdorf> odd question... is there a way to e.preventDefault, store the default events, then call them later on condition?
[02:26:29] <faraway> has someone a recommendation for a Library to manipulate/brows the loaded stylesheets ?
[02:30:01] <faraway> batdorf: what do you mean with later ?
[02:31:36] <batdorf> well, i want to prevent the default on a touch event, then if the touch does not meet a specific condition, the default action is reinstated (i.e. scroll up and down)
[02:32:37] <batdorf> if i don't preventDefault on the touchstart event, then touchmove and touch end do not fire off
[02:33:01] <batdorf> but i need touchmove to process in order to see how far the user has swiped
[02:34:13] <faraway> batdorf: so if the user did not swiped far enought you want the normal behavior take place ?
[02:34:24] <batdorf> yes
[02:34:29] <Kambfhase> why not first check the condition and the preventDefault?
[02:34:34] <batdorf> the ability to scroll up and down
[02:35:10] <batdorf> touchmove won't fire off unless i prevent the default on touchstart
[02:35:19] <batdorf> so i can't measure the distance
[02:35:26] <faraway> batdorf: well even if that would work, i think that could lead to a bad user experience
[02:37:19] <faraway> batdorf: is the swipe with one or two fingers ?
[02:37:52] <amcsi_work> query's .fadeTo() seems to only animate the first selected element properly; the rest are faded instantly in the end. Why?
[02:38:24] <amcsi_work> ah, nvm, my bad
[02:38:30] <batdorf> one
[02:38:44] <batdorf> yeah, im thinking there would be some lag
[02:38:58] <batdorf> I'm not sure how to go about this
[02:39:16] <batdorf> I can't find any good documentation and this seems like it would be a very common iddue
[02:39:19] <batdorf> issue
[02:39:43] <seutje> amcsi_work: got an isolation test-case?
[02:39:44] <faraway> batdorf: it would be easyer if you could describe what you want to achive ;)
[02:39:55] <batdorf> oh
[02:39:59] <batdorf> i thought i was clear ;-)
[02:40:05] <batdorf> ill try again
[02:40:39] <batdorf> there are three touch events, touchstart, touchmove, and touchgo
[02:40:48] <batdorf> sorry, the last is touchend
[02:41:17] <amcsi_work> my bad, the els were selected with $(jqEl1, jqEl2, jqEl3...), which is bad
[02:41:41] <faraway> batdorf: thats what is clear … what i meant is something like "i want that vertical scrolling works but in a certain area i want the horizonal moving does another action"
[02:42:40] <batdorf> now, I have it set to detect if there is a horizontal scroll of more than 100 units. After which a custom action occurs. However, the user cannot scroll up and down on the element because in order for touchmove to register, I have to preventDefault on touchstart
[02:43:08] <batdorf> if i do not prevent the default, then touchmove never registers
[02:44:09] <batdorf> i want vertircal scrolling always
[02:44:17] <ejcweb> I'm trying to make a jQuery plugin (which modifies the behaviour of a text input), and everything works fine if I apply it just to one input, but when I apply to another, sometimes the two will interact (ie. I click on the first, and it focusses the second). How can I make sure my variables/element references aren't becoming mixed up? I'm finding it confusing to debug. Thanks!
[02:44:50] <seutje> ejcweb: breakpoint and check variable scopes
[02:45:23] <seutje> ?g fixingthesejqueries @ ejcweb
[02:45:26] <bot-t> ejcweb, Fixing These jQuery | adam j. sontag - http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[02:45:34] <faraway> batdorf: ok now i know what you want to achieve ;)
[02:45:49] <batdorf> there will never be horizontal scrolling
[02:45:54] <seutje> these a lovely slide in there on checking variable scoping, think it's entitled "going local" or some shut
[02:46:19] <batdorf> so if they attempt it, it will be interpreted as a swipe, and a new panel will load
[02:47:52] <ejcweb> seutje: Here's the code, incidentally (http://jsfiddle.net/J3efv/1/). I'll check out that link now :)
[02:48:35] <Kambfhase> ejcweb: click on the button labeled "JSLint" and fix these problems
[02:48:57] <batdorf> any ideas?
[02:49:08] <faraway> batdorf:  yes ;)
[02:49:33] <faraway> batdorf: but i haven't looks at touch events for some time
[02:49:38] <seutje> ejcweb: looks like the $wrapper is a lie
[02:50:20] <faraway> batdorf: so i don't know if this will work. but you have a touchenter event. this should afaik be triggered while you scroll end move the finer into an element, is that right ?
[02:50:44] <Kambfhase> ejcweb: Start using the keyword `var` today. Its free! It speed up your code. All the pros use it!
[02:51:09] <faraway> batdorf: *scroll and move  the finger*
[02:51:32] <r500> seutje:  http://jsfiddle.net/jwHFF/2/   on 1st div click  div1 and div 2 goes out of  the html page in internet explorer. is there anything that can i do to fix the problem?
[02:51:49] <r500> in mozilla it works fine
[02:52:04] <batdorf> it doesn't :(
[02:52:18] <batdorf> if you scroll, only the touchstart  fires off
[02:52:18] <Kambfhase> DId you know that every browser except Opera is a Mozilla?
[02:52:39] <batdorf> if you tap, then touchstart and touch end (not touchmove)
[02:52:51] <ejcweb> seutje: How so?
[02:53:08] <batdorf> but if you preventdefault on touchstart, then all fire off (but the user can't scroll the page)
[02:53:19] <faraway> batdorf: and when is touchenter tiggered ?
[02:53:31] <faraway> batdorf: ah only with the move
[02:54:18] <batdorf> granted, ive only tested this on android with chrome browser
[02:56:10] <faraway> batdorf: then you need to simulate the scrolling :P
[02:56:19] <batdorf> lol
[02:56:26] <batdorf> i wrote that out but it was ugly
[02:57:19] <faraway> batdorf: yeah … sorry i don't know a solution right now, but i will investigate further
[02:57:21] <batdorf> it would be nice if i could just turn scrolling back on
[02:58:43] <batdorf> thanks, ill keep you posted here too
[02:58:46] <seutje> r500: no clue
[02:59:07] <seutje> ejcweb: there's no div, $wrapper tries to select a div
[02:59:46] <peterschmidler> What's wrong with this: http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/AvyLH
[03:00:24] <ejcweb> seutje: I thought I'm creating a div in $wrapper, and wrapping the input element with it?
[03:01:11] <faraway> batdorf: i have an idea … give me some minutes to think about it
[03:01:41] <seutje> ejcweb: oh wow, I'm stupid, ignore me
[03:03:10] <batdorf> faraway: cool thanks
[03:03:27] <ejcweb> seutje: But still, the click handler is being applied to both wrappers the second time i call the tokenInput() function.
[03:03:55] <batdorf> i should say that when i preventdefault, all events run when i doubletap and swipe
[03:04:06] <batdorf> and scroll works then too
[03:04:16] <batdorf> so maybe i can manipulate that somehow
[03:05:09] <seutje> ejcweb: yeah, I dunno dude, sry. don't rly have time to step through the whole thing and debug
[03:05:22] <ejcweb> seutje: np, thanks
[03:07:08] <zulu-gula> anybody knows why nivo slider does not work on chrome browser?
[03:07:15] <zulu-gula> I mean - slide effect does not work
[03:07:32] <peterschmidler> I have a function that automatically fades out an element after the mouse hasn't moved for a while. If I fire it on (document).ready it works as expected, but if I fire it on (window).load it doesn't. Why? http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/AvyLH
[03:07:41] <zulu-gula> it works even in lovely UE
[03:07:51] <zulu-gula> here is the website: http://www.osiedlemazurskie.pl/
[03:08:17] <zulu-gula> second issue with nivo-slider is, that the images has no links
[03:10:52] <Kambfhase> peterschmidler: you should not use setTimeout with a string as first argument
[03:12:01] <majd> Hey #jquery - i have a page with a bunch of <a> tags, that i want to use .hid() and .show() on, based on click events. When i do .hide(), everything works fine, but when i .show(), they do not appear... I haven't been able to reproduce the issue in a jsFiddle... i'm completely confused!
[03:13:10] <Kambfhase> ?p @ majd
[03:13:11] <bot-t> majd, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:13:14] <peterschmidler> Kambfhase: After I changed $(window).mouseover(function.. to $(document).mouseover(function.. it works again!
[03:15:00] <fRAiLtY-> http://pastie.org/4531762 Hi guys, I'm trying to say on line 20 if option == '5 Working Days' and the selected option from select eq(2) is == a value but unsure how to combine :x
[03:16:15] <faraway> batdorf: hmm ios sends touchmove -.- and my android test device is not around here
[03:17:47] <Kambfhase> fRAiLtY-: you only need to declar a variables once using `var`.
[03:18:14] <Kambfhase> `var` is like saying `int x`
[03:18:14] <b-ot> Kambfhase, memorised “var`”.
[03:18:22] <majd> Kambfhase: "I haven't been able to reproduce the issue in a jsFiddle."
[03:18:27] <Kambfhase> bot-t: forget var
[03:18:27] <bot-t> Kambfhase, I don't remember "var".
[03:18:36] <Kambfhase> b-ot: forget var
[03:18:36] <b-ot> Kambfhase, I have forgotten “var”.
[03:18:58] <Kambfhase> majd: yeah, paste your whole code into a paste bin
[03:19:46] <Kambfhase> fRAiLtY-: have you tried && ?
[03:24:23] <batdorf> faraway: can you test this site?
[03:24:37] <faraway> batdorf: which one ?
[03:24:46] <batdorf> hold on a sec, ill upload the code
[03:27:26] <batdorf> http://kevinbatdorf.com/coda-slider-beta-dev/#4
[03:30:38] <batdorf> http://kevinbatdorf.com/coda-slider-demo/#1
[03:30:49] <batdorf> the second one has preventDefault
[03:44:38] <faraway> batdorf: sorry i can't halp you further cause i don'T have an andorid device here i just can say that it works with ios5 safari/chrome
[03:45:13] <batdorf> what works?
[03:45:27] <batdorf> if it works on ios, that that's good enough for now
[03:45:46] <batdorf> can you scroll up and down while holding onto the element (the slider)?
[03:45:57] <batdorf> and can you swipe left to right and see the panels change?
[03:46:32] <faraway> batdorf: yea, because in ios i get the tuchmove without preventDefault
[03:50:40] <batdorf> did it work on the site?
[03:51:01] <batdorf> i have another friend using an older version but says its not working :(
[03:51:06] <batdorf> but she says the select box isn't even working lol
[03:52:27] <faraway> batdorf: it is like that this changed form ios 4 to ios5
[03:52:35] <Deviad> Hello everyone. Can anyone please have a look at this code: http://pastebin.com/pc5zkmdx
[03:52:52] <Deviad> For some reason gomap does not work if I embed it inside all of that code.
[03:53:02] <Deviad> If I use that code apart in a blank page it works well.
[03:53:46] <Deviad> I'm creating a website wherein the code is located in a single index.html file.
[03:54:02] <Deviad> And I put all of the jquery stuff in a single file.
[03:54:52] <batdorf> she's crazy... she says its all working now, but its laggy
[03:57:46] <fRAiLtY-> Kambfhase:  Think this is OK? See new line at bottom: http://pastie.org/4531762
[03:58:26] <Kambfhase> yeah, try it and see
[03:58:29] <batdorf> thanks faraway , if its working on iOS that's good enough for now
[03:59:05] <mazzachre> What is the current status on templates? I have this issue (which I suspect is quite common) that I get a json object from backend via ajax and need to put the data into an existing format of some kind... However I need this many places and would like a generic way of doing it... Just saw that jQuery.template is not going from beta and that work is being done on something else? What does everyone do?
[04:00:19] <rgr> Anything obviously wrong with this select to get checked radio button from a group all with the name "editorpaneselection"? $("#editeventform input:radio[name='editorpaneselection']:checked")
[04:01:13] <Kambfhase> a radio is not checked, iirc
[04:01:57] <rgr> yes they are according to all the docs I have read
[04:02:14] <rgr> eg search for radio here http://api.jquery.com/val/
[04:02:50] <Kambfhase> umm, ok.
[04:03:02] <mazzachre> rgr: That should work though... Have you tried the obvious? Like debugging it? (First Do the first part and see what you get, then add the next etc.)
[04:03:15] <Deviad> Anyone can answer to my question? I've been trying different things for today but I couldn't solve it...
[04:03:27] <Deviad> 2 days*
[04:03:41] <Kambfhase> Deviad: i gues the author of that plugin fucked something up
[04:03:54] <Deviad> you mean gomap?
[04:03:56] <rgr> I just need to know if it looks right. Of course I have debugged it : but I'm getting no value back from the resulting object. Thanks. I'll google.
[04:06:24] <Deviad> http://pastebin.com/Ekw03qKH
[04:06:30] <Deviad> In there it works fine.
[04:06:50] <Deviad> I'm using the code from "Jquery the missing manual".
[04:07:23] <Deviad> For whatever reason it works fine in a single webpage and it doesn't work in my complex webpage with many plugins loading on load.
[04:38:46] <cusco> hello folks
[04:39:15] <cusco> using autocomplete, I'm having dificulty returning objects...
[04:39:41] <cusco> with several info besides the label
[04:40:13] <Flo0815> hey guys
[04:40:35] <Flo0815> does someone know if a base64 encoded string (originalyy an image) is altered if i send it via ajax?
[04:41:05] <Kambfhase> Flo0815: no i guess not, why should it?
[04:41:18] <Kambfhase> cusco: so, what you question?
[04:41:29] <Kambfhase> +s+r
[04:41:36] <Flo0815> when i save it as image before the ajax, it's working, afterwards the created image is nearly double in filesize
[04:41:59] <Flo0815> and broken, btw
[04:43:09] <cusco> Kambfhase: nvm found it
[04:43:21] <cusco> Kambfhase: I was having trouble converting the object from php to json
[04:43:29] <Kambfhase> :)
[04:43:36] <Flo0815> cusco: json_encode() ?
[04:43:51] <cusco> yes but the array inside the array was missing
[04:43:58] <Flo0815> ah!
[04:44:00] <Flo0815> :)
[04:44:00] <cusco> nvm got it..
[04:44:22] <Raydiation> if youre building a tree like menu, would you operate on html or json to build it?
[04:44:35] <Flo0815> json
[04:45:15] <Kambfhase> use json to populate a html template
[04:45:17] <Kambfhase> hrrhrr
[04:45:37] <Flo0815> ah! i forgot the base64_decode :D
[04:45:39] <Flo0815> sry guys
[04:45:43] <Flo0815> and thanks
[04:45:58] <Raydiation> because maybe json is slower^^
[04:46:30] <kkuno> hi
[04:46:44] <kkuno> I have a string, and I need to use that string to call a function
[04:46:53] <kkuno> like    var str = "lol"
[04:46:57] <kkuno> str.function()
[04:47:04] <hekkwan> kkuno $str()
[04:47:05] <kkuno> the function is lol.function()
[04:47:14] <hekkwan> oops
[04:47:23] <hekkwan> sorry - ignore that
[04:47:24] <NodeX> function is a reservedword so good luck with that
[04:47:30] <NodeX> reserved word*
[04:47:40] <kkuno> yeah it was a test
[04:47:50] <kkuno> var x = "lol"
[04:47:57] <kkuno> x.test()
[04:48:02] <kkuno> that's better
[04:48:15] <NodeX> you'll probably have to use apply()
[04:48:20] <NodeX> or call()
[04:48:46] <Raydiation> >> var test = 'hi'; test.func = function(){ print('hi'); }; print(test); test.func();
[04:48:48] <TheFuzzball> I'm animating a resize of an element's with over a flash object and the element wobbles by 1px left and right whilst it's resizing, is there a way to prevent this?
[04:49:22] <Flo0815> ok here's another one: how is it possible to send an ajax request to an external server?
[04:49:55] <dabear> Flo0815: jsonp
[04:50:15] <NodeX> or a serverside proxy
[04:51:28] <kkuno> Raydiation, my function in your example is "hi.func"
[04:51:29] <Flo0815> but jsonp needs get, and a 64encoded image is a long string
[04:51:38] <Flo0815> taqhts won't work, will it?
[04:51:51] <kkuno> I have a string which contains the name of the function
[04:51:56] <kkuno> and I want to call that function
[04:52:00] <Flo0815> eval
[04:52:01] <NodeX> troll
[04:52:10] <NodeX> 12:48:43] <Raydiation> >> var test = 'hi'; test.func = function(){ print('hi'); }; print(test); test.func();
[04:52:23] <kkuno> no
[04:52:26] <Flo0815> eval(string + '()');
[04:52:33] <kkuno> in that case the function is test.func
[04:52:35] <kkuno> not hi.func
[04:52:41] <faraway> kkuno: you don't need eval
[04:52:52] <kkuno> mmh
[04:52:57] <Flo0815> test.func()
[04:52:58] <Flo0815> ?
[04:53:05] <kkuno> doesn't work
[04:53:10] <faraway> kkuno: do you need to pass parmeters ?
[04:53:49] <mblitz> Hi, I have a kind of strange problem with .on   There are 30 divs with id="delete" and when I use $("#delete").on("click",function(){console.log("deleting "+$(this))}) only the first div with delete reacts. Isn't .on() the successor of .live()? Shouldn't it bind to all divs with id delete?
[04:53:51] <dabear> lol
[04:54:00] <dabear> this[test]()
[04:54:05] <kkuno> faraway, yes
[04:54:09] <quicksilver> mblitz: (1) you're using on wrong (2) there is only one div with ID delete.
[04:54:10] <Flo0815> mblitz: id needs to be Unique
[04:54:13] <NodeX> mblitz: id's are unique
[04:54:17] <Flo0815> use class
[04:54:17] <quicksilver> that's what ID means. unique identifier.
[04:54:22] <faraway> kkuno: give me a little bit time
[04:54:23] <quicksilver> and read the docs for on.
[04:54:28] <mblitz> Since when?
[04:54:30] <kkuno> faraway, ok
[04:54:32] <quicksilver> it replaces live but you have to call it differently.
[04:54:34] <NodeX> since forever
[04:54:38] <Flo0815> ^^
[04:54:42] <mblitz> I always used live(9 that way
[04:55:05] <NodeX> [12:54:29] <quicksilver> it replaces live but you have to call it differently.
[04:56:08] <mblitz> Mhh so I should use a class instead of multiple id's with the same name?
[04:56:16] <NodeX> secondly the first div will only ever react because id's are supposed to be unique so jquery will actr on the first one
[04:56:22] <Flo0815> mblitz: yes
[04:56:23] <NodeX> yes class ;)
[04:56:34] <mblitz> ok thanks.
[04:59:23] <mblitz> So whats wrong on my .on i wrote up there? (appart of the div)
[05:02:32] <dabear> mblitz: on is both the successor to .bind and .live, you have to tell it to use the functionality of .live by specifing the event and a selector
[05:02:51] <dabear> .on( events, selector, callback)
[05:03:16] <dabear> you dropped the selector, so it behaves as .bind instead
[05:03:24] <faraway> kkuno: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/mpp8P/2/
[05:04:04] <mblitz> I see. Thank you. Is tehre a disadvantage to use it like I used it?
[05:04:26] <faraway> kkuno: it should work cross browser, but i haven't tested
[05:04:32] <quicksilver> it won't pick up elements added to the page later that way, mblitz
[05:04:40] <quicksilver> i.e. it isn't a replacement for live, that way.
[05:05:06] <mblitz> Ok got it, then i need to refactor my code.
[05:06:25] <kkuno> faraway, yeah, exactly what I wanted
[05:06:26] <kkuno> thanks
[05:07:04] <faraway> kkuno: that code doesn't check if the function path is correct
[05:09:08] <kkuno> yeah
[05:09:16] <kkuno> jQuery.isFunction()
[05:09:29] <kkuno> faraway, btw, I can use it without the call statement
[05:09:48] <kkuno> i.e. window[x].func(parameter)
[05:10:01] <kkuno> if I have fixed parameters
[05:10:16] <faraway> kkuno: sure …  this code is if you have longer paths ;)
[05:10:38] <kkuno> ok
[05:10:39] <kkuno> thanks :P
[05:10:46] <dabear> wth
[05:10:59] <dabear> why do you want this faraway/ kkuno ?
[05:11:27] <faraway> dabear: if don't want, he asked ;)
[05:11:31] <dabear> it's a lot of overhead just for the convenience just for being able to call a function from a sring
[05:11:39] <dabear> string*
[05:11:58] <kkuno> dabear, what can I do instead?
[05:12:08] <dabear> If you need this, you're doing it wrong(tm)
[05:12:21] <dabear> kkuno: instead of what? why do you need it in the first place?
[05:12:32] <dabear> this is *bad* design
[05:12:50] <kkuno> mmh
[05:13:06] <kkuno> I need to call external js script and call a function inside them
[05:13:16] <dabear> you should know what variables/functions exist before calling them
[05:13:19] <Kambfhase> the design, *bad* it is.
[05:13:52] <dabear> test.test2.test3 ( 1, 10, 20, 40);​ should do the same
[05:14:24] <kkuno> ok the problem is:
[05:14:37] <kkuno> I have to extend my js script with external "plugins"
[05:14:47] <kkuno> plugins list is stored in strings
[05:15:02] <kkuno> so I have to load external scripts and load the proper function
[05:15:26] <kkuno> so I need function like     plugin1.func(),   plugin2.func()
[05:15:28] <kkuno> etc..
[05:15:46] <dabear> .func??
[05:16:04] <faraway> kkuno: then split the string into pluginName and function
[05:16:05] <dabear> if you have something like var plugins = {};
[05:16:28] <dabear> and then you add plugins.plugin1func = function()();
[05:17:12] <dabear> then you could call a plugin dynamically by doing var f="plugin1func"; plugins[f]() // calls plugins.plugin1func()
[05:18:21] <dabear> plugins.plugin1func = function(){};
[05:18:22] <dabear> *
[05:19:38] <kkuno> dabear, that's what I've done
[05:19:54] <kkuno> window[x].func(parameter)
[05:20:00] <kkuno> where x is the name of the plugin
[05:20:05] <kkuno> what's the difference?
[05:21:09] <kkuno> I think it's more elegant to have     pluginname.func1 puginname.func2   than     plugin.pluginnamefunc1 plugin.pluginnamefun2
[05:23:57] <dabear> yeah sure
[05:24:18] <dabear> that was just an example ofc
[05:38:32] <peterschmidler> Can I add a callback function to an each function, that gets executed after all each instances have been executed?  http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/aJfFg
[05:40:01] <Trisox> can any one take alook plz http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/pzsya/1/
[05:41:38] <dabear> peterschmidler: why? .each is syncronious
[05:42:11] <peterschmidler> dabear: I want to execute another function after all squares have been faded in...
[05:42:12] <tocka> How could I show live results when something is being added to an array?
[05:42:15] <tocka> Is it possible?
[05:42:23] <dabear> i.e. thins below the each will happen after each is complete
[05:42:28] <Trisox> nm got it
[05:44:54] <Kambfhase> dabear, you are wrong, he is animating elements
[05:45:52] <peterschmidler> Kambfhase, dabear: Is there any simpler solution than this? http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/aJfFg
[05:46:17] <Kambfhase> please do not use alert() :S
[05:48:11] <dabear> peterschmidler: dunno if it's simpler, but animations can be converted to deferreds
[05:48:21] <quicksilver> I would put an animation on the first one (only)
[05:48:25] <dabear> in which case you can use .then on a set of animations
[05:48:28] <dabear> http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/02/merging-jquery-deferreds-and-animate
[05:48:47] <quicksilver> and the callback for that anim would call $(this).next('.test')
[05:48:59] <quicksilver> and if there is one, it would set up the next anim
[05:49:05] <peterschmidler> Thanks for the input.
[05:49:09] <quicksilver> if there wasn't, then it would stop
[05:49:41] <Trisox> pff stupid touchslide on ipad ...
[05:49:49] <Trisox> works on opera and chrome but not on safari...
[05:49:55] <Trisox> also works on android
[06:00:11] <faraway> tocka: why don't you know that somethng is added to an array ?
[06:00:27] <tocka> faraway never mind :)
[06:04:59] <codepython777> Can anyone help me make this in jquery: http://www.dpreview.com/galleries/9981241531/photos/slideshow?start=4 ?
[06:05:19] <codepython777> Perhaps a github project where a few people could contribute into this?
[06:05:36] <codepython777> Anyone interested?
[06:05:49] <codepython777> Its done in flash it seems
[06:08:51] <mazzachre> Anyone here using JsRender? I was wondering if I have to store my templates with $.templates ? Globally? I really wanted to store my template in a variable and use that variable when I came to it...
[06:13:22] <ML74> i'm looking for a way to reload an html table on button click. is this easy to do?
[06:13:41] <code_ph0y> hey guys could someone tell me if you can set a change event on a div
[06:13:52] <code_ph0y> so if the div changes it will trigger?
[06:18:02] <Kambfhase> code_ph0y: since a div is not a form element it does not change.
[06:20:06] <code_ph0y> perfect bud thanks!
[06:20:54] <Kambfhase> still if you listen for a change event on a div inner form elements might bubble
[06:21:17] <mazzachre> code_ph0y: That does not prevent you from adding a change listener... You can always do .trigger('change') on it from somewhere else... It would be kind of wierd though
[06:22:08] <code_ph0y> basically I have a form validation framework and I wanna track when the info div changes
[06:22:32] <mazzachre> code_ph0y: And when does this info div change?
[06:22:34] <code_ph0y> its cool but I'll do an on change on the form elements and track the lenght of the form
[06:22:49] <code_ph0y> length*
[06:23:19] <mazzachre> code_ph0y: The "fine" way of doing it would probably be to attach a trigger with a custom event to whatever changes it, then you can bind to that event from what needs to know...
[06:23:51] <code_ph0y> nice mazzachre! i'll try something like that!
[06:25:36] <mazzachre> code_ph0y: So, you have <div id="formchangerinfo"/> Any and all elements in your form do $('#formchangerinfo').trigger('formchange'); Then you can $('#formchangerdiv').bind('formchange', function(event) {...});
[06:26:16] <mazzachre> code_ph0y: That would be nicely decoupled, so you could attach any number of listeners and any number of activators without them knowing about each other...
[06:31:36] <djsounds02> any ideas on how to select the first paragraph when it has 2 headings before it
[06:32:50] <djsounds02> $('#pageFull p').filter(':first').css("display", "inline-block");
[06:32:53] <djsounds02> this is what I have
[06:33:09] <asker> hey guys
[06:33:30] <asker> does jquery cache the objects using .data() somehow?
[06:33:40] <ML74> i'm looking for a way to reload data in an html table on button click. is this easy to do?
[06:33:50] <mazzachre> djsounds02: And what are you looking for?
[06:34:01] <mazzachre> ML74: Yes, it is easy to do
[06:34:19] <faraway> djsounds02: and what is wrong with this ?
[06:34:27] <asker> once .data() used the value seems to be cached, after manipulating the attribute .data() return the old value
[06:34:49] <djsounds02> mazzachre: http://kubeonedesign.co.uk/refrigeration/services/ on this link there is an image inside a paragraph i want to select the first paragraph to give it a new css style
[06:35:00] <djsounds02> faraway: not working :(
[06:35:12] <ML74> mazzachre: how would i go about it? it's for a guest listing web app, so as people are checked in, they're removed from the guest list. as there's 2/3 devices being used, they all need to refresh every 5 seconds or so.
[06:35:19] <Francis47> i got a floating div, fixed to the top when reaching the top - the offset of itself and its containing div: http://jsfiddle.net/BtzYa/ - How can i make it stop at a eg. #footer div and stay there?
[06:35:40] <faraway> djsounds02: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/z8AQq/1/
[06:36:27] <djsounds02> thanks faraway the .find the key?
[06:37:00] <djsounds02> faraway: does the same apply when its an id not a class?
[06:37:13] <djsounds02> just change.div to #div?
[06:37:14] <faraway> djsounds02: no … works both as you can see … just two different approaches
[06:37:27] <djsounds02> well mines not applying :(
[06:39:10] <faraway> djsounds02: well at the place where you have your selector it cannot find an element, cause at this time there body isn't there
[06:39:21] <djsounds02> body?
[06:39:30] <mazzachre> ML74: Without knowing anything about your code... setInterval(function(element) {return function() {$.ajax({url: 'tableurl', context: element, success: function(data) {$(this).html(data)}})}($('#mytable')), 5000);
[06:39:34] <faraway> djsounds02: <body>
[06:39:59] <mazzachre> ML74: Would update your table every 5 seconds with the contents of an ajax call...
[06:40:03] <djsounds02> faraway: <body> is there
[06:40:14] <djsounds02> faraway: right under </head>
[06:40:16] <djsounds02> lol
[06:40:31] <faraway> djsounds02: not at the time when jQuery('#pageFull p'). is executed
[06:40:46] <ML74> mazzachre: would that end up back up at the top of the table? i would like it so that the data changes and the table doesn't move at all
[06:40:51] <djsounds02> I dont understand..
[06:41:04] <djsounds02> custom.js is called before body
[06:41:44] <granden> I get this, "Unhandled DOMException: SYNTAX_ERR" on my page. What could cause it?
[06:41:54] <mazzachre> ML74: The data should be the insides of the table, and it will only replace the inside, not the table itself...
[06:42:06] <squeakytoy> I have an interesting problem. Obviously, if the whole page gets reloaded during an ajax request is made, the ajax request will fail. Is there a figure out the requests fails due to page reload?
[06:42:08] <mazzachre> ML74: If it is just a list of users, maybe using a list would be a wiser choice?
[06:42:16] <ML74> mazzachre: it looks like this http://grab.by/frxQ
[06:42:22] <ML74> so needs two cells
[06:42:25] <faraway> djsounds02: exactly, and cause you have selector not wrapped in a document ready callback it is executed directly
[06:42:27] <granden> http://pastebin.com/VXqmLxn5
[06:42:36] <granden> that is my jquery
[06:43:08] <faraway> djsounds02: so everything below custom.js is not visible to jquery, cause it is not created at that time
[06:43:30] <Kambfhase> ?lint @ granden
[06:43:30] <bot-t> granden, if you're bored waiting for someone to fix your broken code you can always try to find the problem yourself by pasting it into http://jsHint.com/
[06:43:52] <faraway> djsounds02: and jQuery(selector) only applies to the elements that are in the dom at the time you call that function
[06:44:00] <mazzachre> ML74: OK, then a table it is... If you return <tr><td>blah</td><td>more blah</td></tr><tr>...</tr> from the ajax call, and use the code I have supplied above, that should work fine...
[06:45:01] <granden> Kambfhase: Ok, thanks will take a look at that.
[06:46:51] <Kambfhase> granden: you are missing a comma on line 12
[06:47:23] <djsounds02> faraway: http://jsfiddle.net/UNmeX/
[06:47:45] <ML74> mazzachre: Ok, cheers :)
[06:48:46] <granden> Kambfhase: Yeah understood that from the lint :)
[06:48:55] <faraway> djsounds02: well if you don't choose the right framework it does not work also you forgot an ); at the end http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/UNmeX/1/
[06:49:06] <Kambfhase> granden: btw, this code is a bit nicer: http://pastebin.com/sAnbnti8
[06:50:15] <sahbeewah> also missing a comma after the data object element
[06:50:33] <Kambfhase> oh, yeah!
[06:50:41] <Kambfhase> missing commas are hard to spot.
[06:51:55] <djsounds02> faraway: Boom!
[06:51:55] <granden> now it starts to get a bit confusing here :)
[06:51:57] <sahbeewah> also, incorrectly have a comma in place of a semi colon in the success callback
[06:52:22] <djsounds02> faraway: thankyou Ive learnt a bit more deffinately I never know what the .ready was really
[06:52:38] <granden> Kambfhase: sahbeewah Where is the missing comma supposed to be in Kambfhase link?
[06:53:06] <granden> Kambfhase: Thanks a lot for the nicer code. Great :)
[06:53:13] <faraway> djsounds02: just well always keep in mind that jQuery(select) creates a list of the elements that are visible at the time you do the query
[06:53:15] <Yiq> $.get('testpersta.appspot.com', function (response) {console.log(response);});
[06:53:34] <sahbeewah> s/$('test').html(data),/$('test').html(data);/
[06:53:36] <Yiq> why doesnt that work? the get from that site outputs a jsonobject in a s tring
[06:53:48] <Kambfhase> line 12: right after the closing brace
[06:53:49] <djsounds02> faraway: is there a .filter(:second/:third/:fourth) ???
[06:53:50] <Yiq> tried to run it in a fiddle
[06:54:02] <Kambfhase> djsounds02: :eq(3)
[06:54:02] <granden> ah
[06:54:05] <granden> thanks both of you
[06:55:04] <granden> Still gets this though, "Unhandled DOMException: SYNTAX_ERR" in error console
[06:56:20] <granden> Ok, dont seem to be my problem.
[06:56:27] <granden> STill gets it even after removing my code.
[06:57:47] <djsounds02> Kambfhase: Thankyou!  faraway Thankyou again!
[06:57:59] <sahbeewah> granden: repost your fixes
[06:58:37] <sahbeewah> Yiq: add the http:// to it
[06:58:49] <granden> http://pastebin.com/T14zcFrQ
[06:58:56] <granden> still some trouble with that
[06:59:15] <sahbeewah>  data: { array: games } still needs a comma
[06:59:24] <granden> though
[07:00:56] <granden> Ok, now it seams as it acctually does something.
[07:01:07] <granden> But I cant spot whats happening :)
[07:01:20] <granden> scoreupdate.php now only does a echo '1';
[07:01:22] <granden> to try it out
[07:01:33] <djsounds02> faraway: I like jQuery, something I'd love to learn is the animate function.. could you show me how to animate a drop down menu just a ul ul li
[07:01:47] <Yiq> http://codepad.org/hIVJ26lL <- so how do i use jquery as a namsepace or module?
[07:01:54] <djsounds02> Ill do the html for you faraway?
[07:02:03] <Yiq> jquery or jQuery.get doesnt work, cant find referenc e jquery
[07:02:19] <treasonx> morning. Is there anyway to adjust the root of jquery? I want to use jquery from within an iframe and modify the parent page's dom (same domain) without loading jquery into the parent?
[07:03:04] <faraway> djsounds02: sorry … try to figure out yourself. if you have something that partial works and you still have problems then i could have a look on it
[07:03:21] <djsounds02> faraway: I'll hold you to that :p
[07:04:47] <sahbeewah> Yiq: are you running on localhost?
[07:04:52] <Deviad> Can anyone pls help me to embed goMap in here: http://pastebin.com/pc5zkmdx When I put goMap in that .js file it makes stop working all of the other plugins. Pls help me.
[07:05:15] <faraway> djsounds02: well i help here while i'm working, so i help with problems and don't do tutorials at that time :D (most of the time ^^)
[07:05:30] <granden> sahbeewah: Hmm, nope my ajax call/update of webpage does still not work. Any idea? This time I dont have any errors.
[07:06:38] <Yiq> sahbeewah: no, the site is up, i can jquery with just a htmlscript on my computer right?
[07:07:12] <sahbeewah> granden: what do you expect it to do? also, $('test') looks for a <test ...></test> tag which probably isn't what you want
[07:07:50] <sahbeewah> the html file is on your computer?
[07:08:17] <sahbeewah> i.e. file:/// ..?
[07:08:41] <Yiq> http://perstajson.appspot.com/ can you explain how to jquery that site for me? with jquery.get or getJSON
[07:09:15] <granden> sahbeewah: Doh, that is my problem then :)
[07:09:24] <granden> Forgot the # :)
[07:09:33] <raj> shoky, wutup yo
[07:09:43] <granden> Friday afternoon just wanna go home have some beer and watch hockey not this :)
[07:09:49] <granden> but thats life :)
[07:09:55] <sahbeewah> Yiq: you can't just "jquery" a site... if you're gonna do a cross domain call it has to be your own site and you have to set it up correctly
[07:10:44] <sahbeewah> also, if you're running the html file off your computer it won't find the google jquery lib because you didn't specify the full http:// protocol
[07:10:52] <Yiq> sahbeewah: ok but if i do that the script should work?
[07:11:11] <Yiq> can you show me the jquery part so i know that works?
[07:11:41] <granden> sahbeewah: Thanks alot! now it works as expected.
[07:12:55] <sahbeewah> Yiq: you replace <script src="//ajax ... with <script src="http://ajax ...
[07:14:24] <Yiq> and i should still get the jquery not found if i run it off my computer(because thats what i get)?
[07:16:19] <sahbeewah> jQuery with a capital Q
[07:16:21] <Yiq> And to get it to work(on appengine) i have to serve the javascript/html as a static file which queries my sevrer?
[07:17:07] <Yiq> 'failed to load resource, failed to load'. is that because i do it form my comp? or is there an error in the code?
[07:17:47] <Yiq> jQuery.getJSON('perstajson.appspot.com', 'wind',function (data, textStatus, jqXHR) {console.log(data);});
[07:19:49] <garciawebdev> Yiq, include http:// in the URL
[07:21:54] <garciawebdev> how can I select with jQuery a .container's .child that's not inside another nested .container ??
[07:22:20] <quicksilver> is it a direct child of the .container?
[07:29:59] <dov23> Hi, if I define a var inside a closure, is there a way I can make it global?
[07:30:05] <dov23> visible in other closures?
[07:30:44] <treasonx> window.val = yourSecretVal
[07:30:56] <str8uplinux> any reason this is ignoring the ".not("#iptPlList")" http://pastie.org/4533669
[07:31:27] <Francis47> i got a floating div, fixed to the top when reaching the top MINUS the offset of itself and its containing div: http://jsfiddle.net/BtzYa/ - How can i make it stop at a eg. irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/#footer div and stay there until i scroll back up?
[07:32:36] <stewbydoo> hello
[07:32:45] <stewbydoo> anybody out there?
[07:33:36] <timing> only 893 nicks
[07:33:53] <Atty> marco.... polo...
[07:33:55] <timing> have you ever walked in a crowded bar and said: anybody out there?
[07:34:04] <stewbydoo> yea i just did
[07:34:12] <stewbydoo> so heres my question
[07:34:36] <BillCriswell> marco....
[07:35:02] <stewbydoo> why does $("#textAreaID").css({"font-size": "30"}); not work on a text area?
[07:35:24] <BillCriswell> You should have some kind of unit with that 30.
[07:35:40] <stewbydoo> I don't have to though right?
[07:35:41] <timing> px, % or em
[07:35:50] <BillCriswell> I recommend.... inches. To keep it crazy!
[07:36:12] <Francis47> how do i turn this into a plugin?: http://jsfiddle.net/Z9amK/
[07:36:30] <stewbydoo> tried it with px got nothing
[07:36:34] <mobedigg> Hello, why I have form with file field and define for this form function for onsubmit event and in this function I return false, form is still sent?
[07:36:41] <mobedigg> if I have
[07:36:46] <timing> stewbydoo: what does this do: $("#textAreaID").css({"font-size": 30});
[07:36:47] <stewbydoo> $("#companyDescription").css({'font-size': '30px'}); //exact code
[07:37:45] <BillCriswell> stewbydoo: Something else is screwing it up then: http://jsfiddle.net/ATfs5/
[07:38:22] <stewbydoo> hmmm
[07:38:25] <stewbydoo> well thank you
[07:38:29] <BillCriswell> Francis47: Wrap it in $(function($){ /* Your Code */ })(jQuery);
[07:38:31] <timing> this works: http://jsfiddle.net/timing/jMeAY/
[07:38:34] <timing> just click on it
[07:38:44] <stewbydoo> yea I did. what the f
[07:38:46] <stewbydoo> alright thanks
[07:38:53] <timing> BillCriswell: ok, I admit, you were first
[07:39:09] <BillCriswell> timing: That's for that bit of IRC rep.
[07:39:14] <BillCriswell> Good as cash.
[07:39:53] <stewbydoo> wow I wish I had the last 10 minutes of my life back
[07:40:00] <nibblebot> if i have more than one event handler on an element, document.body for example, is there a way I can have the event handlers fire in reverse order so it behaves more like a stack of handlers instead of a queue?
[07:40:33] <BillCriswell> stewbydoo: Happens to us all.
[07:41:10] <timing> stewbydoo: what was it?
[07:41:33] <timing> nibblebot: add the events in reverse order?
[07:41:51] <nibblebot> timing: if i can't control that?
[07:41:57] <nibblebot> i'm implementing a stack of elements
[07:42:02] <timing> nibblebot: then I don't know (yet)
[07:42:05] <nibblebot> each one will register a keyup on document.body
[07:42:09] <BillCriswell> I used to always type "text/javascript" wrong when I used to add the "type" attribute and that was hard to notice. =(
[07:42:11] <nibblebot> i want the topmost on the stack to fire first
[07:42:17] <chrickso> hi all. i've got this code that on click toggleClass('show') which changes display from 'none' to 'block'. since toggleClass doesn't accept a callback, how can i make it wait until that element is visible before performing the next actions?
[07:42:20] <stewbydoo> yea i bet lol
[07:43:08] <nibblebot> @timing another idea i have is to reverse the queue whenever i add a new element to my stack
[07:43:20] <timing> nibblebot: is it possible to add one event to the body and just handle the stacking on click?
[07:43:34] <nFFF> nibblebot, what exactly do you mean?
[07:43:39] <timing> your 'stack' is it the dom?
[07:43:43] <timing> or just an array
[07:43:47] <icjs> so "file://" links will not open unless the containing page was loaded by file:// - is there a way i can write something to open the link in a new tab using file? (maybe javascript)
[07:43:53] <nibblebot> at the time of registering the first handler for the first element on stack, it knows nothing of the future elements that will need to be handled
[07:43:59] <nibblebot> in the dom
[07:44:00] <nFFF> are you talking about events bubbling up the tree?
[07:44:06] <nibblebot> @nFFF no
[07:44:15] <nibblebot> the specific thing i am doing is this:
[07:44:15] <chrickso> here is what it would look like if toggleClass did accept a callback https://gist.github.com/7805cde45b72ca66fb7a
[07:44:21] <Francis47> BillCriswell: How do i include it on my website then?
[07:44:31] <nibblebot> stacked modals where elements on top of the stack have the highest z-index
[07:44:42] <nibblebot> i want hitting 'ESC' key to remove the top most of the stack
[07:44:52] <BillCriswell> You just reference it with a script tag. Unless I'm not picking up what you're putting down exactly.
[07:44:53] <nibblebot> i have that working
[07:44:55] <nibblebot> BUT
[07:45:03] <timing> chrickso: check out jquery toggle() it has a callback
[07:45:14] <nibblebot> i have another type of element my stack manager doesn't know about
[07:45:28] <nibblebot> perhaps i should think about having my stack manager know about it..
[07:45:42] <nFFF> lol sounds overcomplicated :>
[07:45:46] <timing> chrickso: with that do addClass('show') and removeClass('show') if that css class contains more styling you need
[07:45:49] <icjs> BillCriswell, Francis47 - you can leave off the 'type=""' anyway - aiui thats good practice anyway because the only scipt is javascript anyway
[07:45:54] <chrickso> timing: thanks, actually the 'show' class is display: table so toggle() is none/block
[07:46:21] <BillCriswell> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="jquery.toFollow.js"></script>
[07:46:38] <nibblebot> thanks for rubber ducking all, i think the solution will be to have one handler that pops the element off the stack instead of multi handlers
[07:46:45] <BillCriswell> icjs: I know that. When I used to type it that would be a difficult thing to notice.
[07:46:51] <timing> chrickso: then just write your own toggle with hasClass('show')
[07:47:34] <BillCriswell> If you are versioning it do jquery.toFollow-0.0.1.js or something.
[07:48:28] <Francis47> BillCriswell, icjs
[07:48:49] <Francis47> is there any way of turning this into jquery instead then
[07:49:01] <Francis47> cant seem to get it running on my D7 site
[07:49:15] <Francis47> unless ofc - im doing it wrong :)
[07:49:48] <chrickso> timing: not sure what you mean by that
[07:49:54] <Francis47> i basically took this: http://jsfiddle.net/ult_combo/Tgm6Y/1455/ and tried to adapt it to my site
[07:50:37] <BillCriswell> Any JS errors?
[07:51:24] <Francis47> Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Window] is not a function
[07:51:55] <BillCriswell> It doesn't appear you included jQuery.
[07:52:48] <Kambfhase> or someone called jQuery.noConflict()
[07:53:15] <Francis47> i wrapped it in $(function($){ my code })(jQuery); as you told me BillCriswell
[07:53:27] <chrickso> is there an .on() event for when an element becomes :visible?
[07:54:15] <BillCriswell> Francis47: Is there a noConflict in your code somewhere?
[07:54:45] <Francis47> i dont think so
[07:54:48] <Francis47> i didnt write it
[07:55:00] <asker> if i manipulate dom the selector doesnt find the manipulated elements. how do i refresh the selector or something like that?
[07:55:02] <BillCriswell> It's hard to debug without knowing exactly what's going on.
[07:55:06] <Francis47> i grabbed it from here : http://jsfiddle.net/ult_combo/Tgm6Y/1455/
[07:55:17] <Francis47> ofc it is :)
[07:55:50] <Francis47> http://ny.dev.arbejderen.dk/node/82 - is the site im trying to implement it on
[07:56:05] <aniasis> what is the best solution to implement templating into my project?
[07:56:32] <aniasis> I want to take a json string and dump the data into some markup
[07:58:10] <Francis47> BillCriswell: perhaps you can help me find out how to achieve the same thing by extending this: http://jsfiddle.net/BtzYa/1/ - into stopping when it hits the #footer div?
[07:59:40] <xrdodrx> why doesn't this work? $("#maintextarea").keyup(function(){$("#numchars").text(function(){$("#maintextarea").val().length})});
[08:02:02] <NoiseEee> xrdodrx: i give up, what does the console/debugger say?
[08:02:33] <xrdodrx> the horrible formatting is due to the fact that it all needs to run on one line
[08:02:42] <xrdodrx> NoiseEee: nothing, it doesn't seem like it even runs on the keyup event
[08:04:23] <NoiseEee> xrdodrx: http://jsfiddle.net/hcz9f/
[08:04:44] <NoiseEee> you were declaring a function within .text()
[08:05:31] <xrdodrx> thanks NoiseEee
[08:06:17] <NoiseEee> np
[08:07:22] <NoiseEee> xrdodrx: http://jsfiddle.net/hcz9f/1/ would be better
[08:11:53] <ShooterMG> is there a command to remove the last X objects from a selection?
[08:13:31] <Kambfhase> ?lt @ ShooterMG
[08:13:31] <bot-t> ShooterMG, :lt(index): Select all elements at an index less than index within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/
[08:13:42] <ShooterMG> ahh great, thanks
[08:13:45] <stygyan> guys, quick quick question.
[08:13:53] <stygyan> query add class is not working on firefox
[08:13:56] <stygyan> anyone knows why that might be?
[08:13:58] <quicksilver> ?slice @ ShooterMG
[08:13:59] <bot-t> ShooterMG, .slice(start, [end]): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[08:14:14] <stygyan> jquery addclass.
[08:14:14] <ShooterMG> sweet :D
[08:14:47] <quicksilver> stygyan: jquery addClass works fine.
[08:14:57] <quicksilver> stygyan: therefore you'll need to give some more details about how it fails to work for you
[08:15:02] <quicksilver> jsfiddle the code, would be great.
[08:15:04] <stygyan> it's working for me on chrome and safari, but firefox doesn't do anything.
[08:15:35] <stygyan> http://jsfiddle.net/KaLYq/
[08:16:13] <Gargoyle> Anyong using ubaPlayer and having problems getting it to activate on items added to the page dynamically?
[08:16:42] <Deviad> Can anyone pls help me to embed goMap in here: http://pastebin.com/pc5zkmdx ? When I put goMap in that .js file it makes stop working all of the other plugins. Pls help me.
[08:16:49] <quicksilver> looks fine, stygyan
[08:16:58] <K3|Chris> stygyan: errm, that's only JS not html and you're not loading jQuery
[08:17:06] <stygyan> mh
[08:17:14] <stygyan> may i drop the tumblr site?
[08:17:25] <Deviad> I tried using jquery-1.6.3.min.js, but it still prevents the other plugins from working...
[08:17:29] <stygyan> i just dumped the query code
[08:17:36] <pandemic> stygyan: it works for me… one sec
[08:17:39] <K3|Chris> stygyan: which isn't exactly useful
[08:17:46] <pandemic> http://jsfiddle.net/KaLYq/1/
[08:17:56] <K3|Chris> any frankly if you're just giving one part of the code pastebin is better
[08:19:16] <stygyan> weird. it works in here.
[08:19:19] <stygyan> now i'm truly stumped.
[08:19:45] <pandemic> possibly you have some other code interfering with it?
[08:20:17] <stygyan> thing is, it works on other browsers. i tried to look for possible firefox problems and google said there were some
[08:20:46] <quicksilver> most likely either your HTML or your javascript is actually invalid
[08:20:54] <quicksilver> browsers try to "do the best they can" with invalid code
[08:20:56] <stygyan> oh.
[08:21:02] <stygyan> wait, there's something.
[08:21:03] <quicksilver> but they may make different assumptions / guesses
[08:21:11] <quicksilver> whereas if the code is valid you're more likely to get all browsers the same.
[08:21:15] <stygyan> actually it works. the panel goes up and down, so the classes change.
[08:21:20] <stygyan> but the background doesn't change.
[08:21:58] <stygyan> ok
[08:21:59] <stygyan> fixed
[08:22:48] <K3|Chris> if you run into a "bug" on only one of the big 3 engines you're most likely doing something wrong or you're using some browser specific stuff
[08:23:06] <K3|Chris> or you're testing in IE
[08:23:42] <stygyan> i ran into it.
[08:23:44] <pandemic> stygyan: http://jsfiddle.net/KaLYq/3/
[08:23:46] <stygyan> i know what it is :)
[08:23:47] <pandemic> why not try this?
[08:23:51] <pandemic> looks simpler to me :)
[08:24:13] <stygyan> i found the problem
[08:24:18] <stygyan> and it was not a query one
[08:24:41] <stygyan>  it appears that firefox doesn't play well with background: left bottom and so on
[08:25:01] <K3|Chris> stygyan: errm, that's background-position
[08:25:07] <stygyan> yup
[08:25:12] <K3|Chris> ...
[08:25:25] <K3|Chris> shorthands require a certain minimum of properties
[08:25:28] <stygyan> background:url() no-repeat left bottom
[08:25:40] <K3|Chris> sure that order is valid?
[08:25:54] <Deviad> Can anyone pls help me with my problem, I don't wanna get boring, but I tried everything I could think of and it did not help...
[08:26:44] <stygyan> k3, the latest one is
[08:26:45] <K3|Chris> Deviad: no we can't help you unless you actually say what the problem is, and example helps
[08:27:08] <Kambfhase> Deviad: have you tried using the uncompressed version?
[08:27:22] <Kambfhase> or maybe another plugin?
[08:27:28] <K3|Chris> stygyan: I assure you FF has no issues with background
[08:27:38] <K3|Chris> YDIW more like
[08:27:41] <Deviad> K3|Chris, when I embed goMap along with Cycle Lite, everything stops working. Cycle Lite stops working, tabbed browsing stops working, etc...
[08:28:00] <Deviad> Nav plugin also stops working...
[08:28:15] <K3|Chris> anyone has any idea what he's talking about?
[08:28:27] <Deviad> That's just including the plugin amongst the file to be loaded at start.
[08:28:35] <Deviad> files*
[08:28:39] <NoiseEee> Deviad: sounds like you should contact the developer of goMap or look for some help with that library
[08:31:25] <jonathancutrell> Can someone tell me how much faster a handlebars template would be than doing concatenation in jQuery/straight string manip in js?
[08:31:33] <jonathancutrell> Or rather… Why it is faster.
[08:31:48] <jonathancutrell> (Or mustache, or anything else)
[08:32:13] <jonathancutrell> Is it not a performance thing, but instead a concept thing? Where it's about separating the markup from the js?
[08:32:19] <danzik171> jonathancutrell: it's not faster.  it's cleaner and easier to manage.
[08:32:27] <jonathancutrell> Ah okay.
[08:32:31] <jonathancutrell> That's what I figured.
[08:32:35] <jonathancutrell> Cause in the end,
[08:32:51] <jonathancutrell> the string manipulation isn't the perf hit, it's the resulting dom manipulation.
[08:33:49] <jonathancutrell> So, in that case - is it faster to use some MVC js (Backbone) than templates? I'm assuming not, but if so, why/how?
[08:34:38] <ajpiano> jonathancutrell: those frameworks all use templates
[08:34:38] <danzik171> you're still going to be ( or should be ) using templates with an MVC framework in JS
[08:35:03] <jonathancutrell> ajpiano: I suppose that would be the "V" in MVC.
[08:35:31] <ajpiano> jonathancutrell: as danzik171 was saying, the point of templates isn't about speed, it's about not having any markup in js.... separation of concerns, etc
[08:36:13] <jonathancutrell> ajpiano: That's what I figured, I just wanted some clarification on the subject to make more informed decisions.
[08:36:41] <jonathancutrell> ajpiano: Sometimes it works fine for smaller apps I've created to just keep the bit of markup in the JS, and other times the markup justifies the template.
[08:37:22] <ajpiano> eventually you cross the threshold of just being like, fuck it, i'm never going to write markup in my js again
[08:37:42] <ajpiano> i used to feel the same way ^^
[08:37:50] <danzik171> jonathancutrell: you may want to give http://addyosmani.github.com/backbone-fundamentals/#mvc-mvp a read
[08:38:45] <danzik171> ajpiano: especially when you're introduced to partials/helpers and you can compose your templates?  that was like....amazing.
[08:38:46] <jonathancutrell> danzik171: probably.
[08:39:06] <danzik171> update one helper, all templates are fixed.
[08:39:47] <jonathancutrell> danzik171 ajpiano - I agree with that - I've used handlebars on a few projects, and it tickles a little bit of my ruby/rack/sinatra bone.
[08:40:58] <danzik171> handlebars is great, it just doesn't integrate all that well with requirejs at the moment ( and it wasn't build with the intent to )
[08:41:19] <danzik171> underscore's templates are ugly as sin, but really easy to introduce the idea of helpers and partials using requirejs
[08:42:33] <rmah> hello
[08:42:38] <ajpiano> danzik171: surely you are joking
[08:42:45] <ajpiano> danzik171: use SlexAxton's require-handlebars plugin
[08:42:54] <ajpiano> it makes integration like, the most smooth amazing thing in the world
[08:43:00] <ajpiano> like, we're talkin smooth as a baby's bottom
[08:43:11] <rmah> anyone know how to make mouse events go through an image (I'm using it as an overlay).  i..e as if the image was not there?
[08:43:15] <danzik171> ajpiano: it's broken :(    even the demo in the repo doesn't work with the r.js defined there
[08:43:38] <ajpiano> i've used it on every client project for the last 6 months....
[08:43:58] <ajpiano> and it's workin fine
[08:44:26] <danzik171> ajpiano: dunno, i cloned the repo yesterday, installed r.js 2.0.1, and tried to built the demo and it failed
[08:44:31] <rmah> ah, found it... pointer-events: none
[08:44:45] <ajpiano> i haven't tried the demo tbqh
[08:44:56] <nFFF> What do you mean by writing markup in JS?
[08:45:10] <danzik171> it was failing in my actual project too ( which is what caused me to go try the demo to see if i was screwing something up )
[08:45:45] <ajpiano> nFFF: var a = $("<a href="'+ url + "'>"+foo+"</a>");
[08:46:18] <ajpiano> danzik171: that sucks, i am sort of inundated with work stuff today etc
[08:46:23] <ajpiano> but i would like to help you sttraighten it out
[08:46:29] <ajpiano> cause once you get it working it is so beyond worth it
[08:46:41] <danzik171> ajpiano: oh yea, it was cool in development mode, it worked perfectly
[08:46:45] <ajpiano> the auto partial/helper registration
[08:46:47] <ajpiano> ohh
[08:47:03] <danzik171> but its a bit heavy to include in production, so the build step is kinda important
[08:47:10] <rmah> dammit, point-events doesn't work on IE :-(
[08:47:42] <danzik171> either way, it was a good opportunity to learn to write a requirejs plugin - it was really simple to add partial/helper support to _ templates
[08:48:05] <ajpiano> ah, yeah,  ihaven't written a plugin yet but i understand it ain't too bad
[08:48:19] <ajpiano> i always am using the wrapper around r.js that comes in bbb
[08:48:25] <ajpiano> https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/grunt-bbb/blob/master/tasks/requirejs.js
[08:48:35] <ajpiano> just cause that's what my dev setup is, and i haven't had a problem getting it to build
[08:48:45] <kamo> ajpiano plugins are fun to write
[08:48:52] <danzik171> ah that's just the grunt task, i'm  using the same thing
[08:49:36] <ajpiano> danzik171: hum :(
[08:49:51] <ajpiano> danzik171: well if you want i can try to lend a hand next week if you're so inclined
[08:50:20] <danzik171> ajpiano: dunno - jrburke knows that i couldn't get hbs to work, he was gonna try the demo in the repo as well if he had time before 2.0.6
[08:50:29] <ajpiano> oh nice
[08:50:34] <ajpiano> jrburke is way better than me
[08:50:35] <ajpiano> :p
[08:50:39] <ajpiano> and so helpful
[08:50:58] <masak> working with fluent interfaces and selections is the future of APIs. I really like it.
[08:51:07] <masak> I like that about XPath, too. not just jQuery.
[09:02:06] <SlexAxton> danzik171: something in the paths changed between some version of the r.js code
[09:02:21] <SlexAxton> i'll get it fixed soon
[09:02:26] <SlexAxton> i did a bunch of weird things
[09:02:34] <SlexAxton> in order to help people avoid needing _my_ modules
[09:02:40] <SlexAxton> but I think it ends up confusing everyone
[09:02:50] <SlexAxton> and breaks on r.js edge cases more often
[09:03:20] <danzik171> SlexAxton: cool, thanks - other than the build thing, dev works great =P
[09:03:40] <SeanJM> anyone here use Sublime Text 2 by chance?
[09:03:47] <SlexAxton> well use dev while you dev, and I'll fix it before you need to build...
[09:04:27] <SeanJM> and have experience creating snippets for Sublime Text 2?
[09:04:58] <pandemic> SeanJM: I do a little
[09:05:14] <await> Yeah, I've made a few.
[09:05:19] <SeanJM> pandemic: have you ever run into this issue: $scope ${1} = function {${2}}
[09:05:35] <SeanJM> pandemic: where because you want a dollar sign, it messes the snippet up?
[09:05:59] <pandemic> ah, nope. There has to be an escape though
[09:06:52] <pandemic> SeanJM: http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=4914
[09:06:58] <pandemic> \\$
[09:07:16] <pandemic> that what you are looking for?
[09:07:44] <jugstah> can you do such a "do then" statement in jquery?
[09:07:45] <cusco> hello again
[09:08:20] <SeanJM> pandemic: that escape didn't quite work
[09:08:34] <pandemic> hmm
[09:08:38] <Navarr> I have a bug... I'm doing https://gist.github.com/3380235 - TL;DR: two independent objects are listening to window.on('focus' and window.on('blur' and only the latest one is getting the updates, even though I'm not stopping propogation or anything else.
[09:09:14] <Navarr> Using jQuery 1.8.0 (forgot to mention, sorry)
[09:09:57] <ajpiano> Navarr: you probalby need to have var _this = this;
[09:10:03] <SeanJM> pandemic: \$scope ${1} = function {${2}} <-- this worked, thanks
[09:10:04] <ajpiano> Navarr: otherwise there's only one global _this
[09:10:08] <ajpiano> and it gets clobbered
[09:10:20] <pandemic> SeanJM: awesome!
[09:10:23] <Navarr> ajpiano: I was worried it was a stupid error like that.  Thanks.  I'll try it out >.>"
[09:10:32] <ajpiano> Navarr: in both of the files yeah, you have _this as global
[09:10:59] <cusco> using autocomplete, each result has a set of objects associated.. I would like to have different colors on different attributes
[09:11:01] <Navarr> ajpiano: since I have you here, is there a better way of keeping track of an object than the _this hack I'm doing?
[09:11:09] <cusco> per item
[09:11:13] <cusco> how can I do that?
[09:11:52] <danzik171> Navarr: by tracking you meant maintainng the "this" reference?
[09:11:54] <ajpiano> Navarr: well, there's really nothing "hacky" about that, presumably you don't use a global
[09:12:23] <Navarr> ajpiano: I'd like them to be self-sustaining, and danzik171: Yes.
[09:12:23] <ajpiano> Navarr: but, yes, you can also choose to use $.proxy (or _.bind or Function.prototype.bind) to control the scope in bound functions
[09:12:43] <Navarr> ajpiano: I meant in javascript in general, since I'm using timeouts and all that.
[09:12:49] <ajpiano> $(window).on("focus", $.proxy( fn, this ) );
[09:12:58] <ajpiano> Navarr: if you have jQuery, jQuery.proxy will always do the trick
[09:13:04] <Navarr> ajpiano: thanks!
[09:13:08] <ajpiano> when i am in an env that has underscore, i use _.bind
[09:13:40] <ajpiano> and if i'm in node, then just use .bind :p
[09:18:58] <wenzhixue> $(this) is a div .. how can i get the element inside of it ? like <a> inside that div
[09:19:01] * jugstah is away. Automatically set away [SZon]

[09:22:29] <objnoob> hello.
[09:23:07] <objnoob> i'm filtering a collection to two items, and bind a change event to those 2 items. both items on change trigger the event
[09:23:45] <objnoob> within the event, i filter the collect down to those 2 items, and use is(':checked')
[09:23:58] <objnoob> to ensure both checked
[09:24:03] <objnoob> however it doesn't work
[09:25:07] <objnoob> https://gist.github.com/30667610f4c59c216917
[09:26:36] <objnoob> when both options are checked, the sub option input[name="wfh[site]"]
[09:26:46] <objnoob> should be enabled, otherwise disabled
[09:29:09] <objnoob> crap, it appears is returns true is at least one item matches the argument
[09:31:46] <shoky> wenzhixue: .find() or .children()
[09:33:32] <TelFiRE> is there no way to slidetoggle a div whose elements are absolutely positioned?
[09:38:20] <mikehaas763> Good Morning, I need to assign a <tr> table row an ID, so that when that row is clicked I can use jquery to fetch some JSON data for that ID. Would it be best to just have an id="162323" attribute for that row?
[09:38:44] <objnoob> i got this working: https://gist.github.com/30667610f4c59c216917
[09:39:40] <Ayush> have it like  id="a162323"
[09:39:51] <Ayush> will be good
[09:39:55] <NoiseEee> mikehaas763: ideally, id's are for use like the document.  ideally you use <tr data-referencetoken='1232132'>
[09:40:01] <NoiseEee> s/like the/for the/
[09:41:00] <mikehaas763> NoiseEee, Ok, what is data-referencetoke? Is that valid html I have never hear dof it
[09:41:23] <TelFiRE> Can anyone look at my basic/hacky implementation and advise me on a better method for this? http://jsfiddle.net/EQzM7/11/ It's a mobile menu like sony.com has, where you drill down from level to level.
[09:41:55] <Ayush>  mikehaas763:  you can use rel for storing id or etc
[09:42:01] <Ayush> in element
[09:42:18] <Ayush> rel="1213212"
[09:42:39] <NoiseEee> Ayush: no, use data-
[09:43:00] <NoiseEee> mikehaas763: its html5's way of legitamately attaching data/information to dom elements.  also see jquery.data()
[09:43:01] <mikehaas763> I'm already using rel for some jquery interface stuff
[09:43:30] <mikehaas763> NoiseEee, ok. Will it still work in non html5 compliant browsers? IE 7?
[09:43:37] <NoiseEee> mikehaas763: yep
[09:44:34] <mikehaas763> Ok, it's literally called data-referencetoken though?
[09:45:36] <NoiseEee> no, it's a data- attribute.  ie:  <div data-profilekey='132afdf' data-phone='(415) 232-4124'>John Smith</div>
[09:45:36] <mikehaas763> Ah, I'm assuming it would be something like data-jobid="32323"
[09:45:48] <mikehaas763> ^ yup ok thanks
[09:45:53] <Ayush> any u want to call after data-
[09:57:23] <nprice> how do i properly escape brackets in a variable being used as the name of a selector?  EG: $("#confirm"+$(this).attr("rel")).html($(this).val()); - $(this).attr("rel") has a few brackets in it
[09:57:56] <Helbom> hello and good evening
[10:01:40] <wavez> which event first when the user presses 'enter' on an input element?
[10:01:57] <wavez> which event *fires
[10:02:24] <garciawebdev> hey, how to select a .container children but not grandchildren using jQuery?
[10:02:48] <wavez> use the child of selector
[10:02:54] <wavez> .parent > .child
[10:02:56] <garciawebdev> supposing I can have something between the .container and his .children
[10:03:08] <wavez> $('.parent > .child')
[10:03:13] <garciawebdev> (so > doesn't works)
[10:03:38] <garciawebdev> because they are child but not immediate childs
[10:03:44] <wavez> do you know the number of things between the parent and child?
[10:03:49] <garciawebdev> no
[10:03:57] <Haprog> then it IS a grandchild
[10:04:01] <Haprog> if there's something in between
[10:04:05] <garciawebdev> hmmm
[10:04:11] <garciawebdev> Haprog, you're right
[10:04:14] <garciawebdev> but
[10:04:19] <Haprog> are you talking about children or siblings
[10:04:21] <Haprog> ?
[10:04:30] <garciawebdev> inside a .container I can have another .container with .childs
[10:04:38] <garciawebdev> but I don't want to target those
[10:04:41] <Haprog> show an example
[10:04:49] <Haprog> would be easier to understand what you want, maybe
[10:04:55] <garciawebdev> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xIhzf
[10:05:36] <garciawebdev> reload, I've updated it
[10:05:39] <Haprog> I'm watching a movie atm so I can't really focus on code now though.
[10:05:47] <garciawebdev> ok
[10:06:04] <garciawebdev> thanks anyway
[10:07:14] <pandemic> garciawebdev: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/eEupg
[10:07:17] <pandemic> how about that?
[10:07:43] <garciawebdev> pandemic, thanks, but the thing is that .something is optional
[10:07:47] <pandemic> oh
[10:07:50] <pandemic> ok, one sec
[10:08:23] <garciawebdev> :)
[10:09:16] <garciawebdev> also, in between can be .something or anything, I don't know
[10:09:38] <pandemic> will there ever be a unique identifier in the root level or parent?
[10:10:01] <garciawebdev> just classes, if it can be made that way
[10:10:19] <pandemic> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/eEupg
[10:10:25] <pandemic> what about something like this?
[10:11:24] <garciawebdev> hm no, I need to be able to have something between .contextual-container and .contextual
[10:11:28] <PhpDevLuv> I was wondering if someone could help me.  I am trying to make a link click and check a bunch of checkboxes id's by their array:  id = name_here[] .  Is this possible with Jquery?
[10:11:37] <garciawebdev> I think it cannot be done... :(
[10:12:12] <pandemic> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/eEupg
[10:12:13] <pandemic> ?
[10:14:32] <pandemic> ok, i've updated it, how about this?
[10:14:33] <pandemic> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/eEupg
[10:14:38] <PhpDevLuv> anyone have any ideas how I could go about it with Jquery then?  Should I change my id's to not be the array, but be unique?  I have the link click bringing up the function part down, I just need to find a way to check all of the checkboxes in this div or of a particular shared id name
[10:15:58] <BillCriswell> PhpDevLuv: You can do $('a').click(function(){ $(':input[name^=name_here]').check(); }));
[10:16:10] <BillCriswell> .check() might need ot be something else.. drawing a blank right now.
[10:16:43] <BillCriswell> :checkbox[name^=some_name] could also work.
[10:17:20] <pandemic> PhpDevLuv: or $('#mydiv input[type=checkbox]')
[10:17:23] <BillCriswell> attr('checked', true); would be best.
[10:17:27] <pandemic> if all checkboxes are in the same div
[10:17:30] <wavez> what event is fired when a text input loses focus?
[10:17:52] <pandemic> blur isn't it?
[10:18:00] <BillCriswell> wavez: blur.
[10:18:56] <wavez> BillCriswell, do I have to also bind to a different event to catch the 'enter' key press?
[10:19:09] <PhpDevLuv> I tried   $('#ops input[type=checkbox]').attr(checked, true);  where ops is the name of my div id
[10:19:13] <garciawebdev> pandemic, almost. the problem is that many elements can be between the .contextual-container and the .contextual
[10:19:20] <PhpDevLuv> didnt work for some reason, is that incorrect syntax?
[10:19:43] <garciawebdev> and using direct child selector can't do the trich
[10:19:46] <garciawebdev> *trick
[10:21:21] <PhpDevLuv> sry, I mised the quote on 'checked', that worked like a champ!
[10:21:26] <PhpDevLuv> thank you guys soo much!
[10:22:04] <Francis47> http://jqueryfordesigners.com/fixed-floating-elements/ ?
[10:22:06] <PhpDevLuv> I had been beating my head on my desk and cursing at google for hours.. you guys solved this in 5 mins.  -mad props
[10:22:18] <pandemic> garciawebdev: yeah, that's a bit wacky
[10:23:19] <garciawebdev> pandemic, thanks a lot, I'll see what can I do
[10:23:28] <pandemic> I have one more idea, gonna ttry it out.
[10:23:50] <BillCriswell> PhpDevLuv: http://jsfiddle.net/xgZyr/ ?
[10:23:55] <BillCriswell> Oh, you got it.
[10:24:38] <luite> is it possible to change all elemements in a jquery object based on a previous value (without using each) ? for example set scrollTop of all elements to scrollHeight/2
[10:24:39] <PhpDevLuv> yep, ty again
[10:24:47] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[10:25:32] <TelFiRE> "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'menu'" ... it's someone else's plugin, seems to be working locally and on their example, I get this though on my site. Where might the problem lie?
[10:25:35] <pandemic> garciawebdev: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/eEupg
[10:25:42] <pandemic> I think your original filter was close
[10:25:54] <pandemic> hopefully this is what you are looking for
[10:26:42] <garciawebdev> pandemic yessssss
[10:26:47] <pandemic> ;-)
[10:26:48] <garciawebdev> genius!
[10:27:16] <pandemic> garciawebdev: glad I could help. :)
[10:27:25] <garciawebdev> thanks a lot, pandemic
[10:27:27] <garciawebdev> can I buy you a beer?
[10:27:42] <BillCriswell> He's a jello man.
[10:28:03] <pandemic> Haha, no worries man. :)
[10:28:11] <garciawebdev> :)
[10:29:31] <BillCriswell> Slowest day ever.
[10:29:54] <pandemic> I enjoy those from time to time
[10:30:07] <pandemic> gives me a chance to do some R&D
[10:31:29] <BillCriswell> I've been learning Magento for work. It's brutal the lack of clear documentation.
[10:32:11] <pandemic> yeah, I tried to play around with it a bit once. I was a little overwhelmed
[10:32:56] <BillCriswell> Yeah, it's pretty damn intimidating. I'm getting it though... slowly but surely.
[10:33:05] <pandemic> good luck :)
[10:33:32] <imsky> hitler is the 21st century peoples champ aka the original patriot
[10:33:41] <ajpiano> oh come on imsky
[10:33:42] <BillCriswell> Oh yeah?
[10:33:51] <imsky> lol
[10:34:08] <ajpiano> imsky: you realise that coming into a channel and doing that kind of shit gets you banned from places
[10:34:17] <imsky> i'm quoting catb0t
[10:34:21] <ajpiano> congrats
[10:34:28] <wavez> I have an element that I have bound a function to it's click event. How do I unbind?
[10:34:50] <BillCriswell> $el.unbind('click') ?
[10:34:51] <pandemic> http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[10:34:53] <jyg> This is really small and simple, I think I just need another pair of eyes to take a look, please:  http://pastebin.com/KxkRyHnU
[10:35:16] <jyg> for some reason my .data() is not getting the data- attribute values
[10:35:22] <Francis47> can someone look at this: http://ny.dev.arbejderen.dk/indland and tell
[10:35:32] <jyg> stared at this too long
[10:35:49] <imsky> saw a picture of lenin
[10:35:52] <imsky> refuse to help now
[10:35:53] <jyg> Francis, taking a peek
[10:36:19] <Francis47> in the right sidebar when you scroll the Kalender bar is getting a fixed position - do any of you know if theres a way of stopping it before it hits the bottom - or an underlying element?
[10:36:35] <pandemic> jyg: it's working for me
[10:36:43] <pandemic> http://jsfiddle.net/MJZUX/
[10:36:47] <jyg> pandemic, hmm you're not getting undefined?
[10:36:52] <pandemic> nope, i get 1
[10:37:20] <jyg> crapola... works for me there too
[10:37:22] <jyg> well thanks for looking
[10:37:27] <pandemic> no problem
[10:37:28] <jyg> gotta something in the page
[10:37:38] <pandemic> yeah, something may be interfering
[10:37:50] <Francis47> i am using this to achieve the fixed position: http://jsfiddle.net/eGHQR/
[10:37:52] <BillCriswell> I never knew .data() pulled in data-attributes... I've been using .attr('data-*') this whole time.
[10:37:58] <BillCriswell> I should read things once in a while.
[10:37:59] <imsky> lol
[10:38:02] <imsky> just lol
[10:38:06] <pandemic> BillCriswell: yeah same here lol
[10:38:07] <jyg> oh hmm there's some other dom-manipulating JS running...
[10:38:46] <xrdodrx> I'm trying to do something to the text in a form field BEFORE submitting it. But if I bind the function to the .on("click") event of the submit button, it just does that and doesn't submit the form after. Why?
[10:38:58] <xrdodrx> Binding it to .on("submit") does nothing. Neither the action nor the submission
[10:39:41] <wavez> BillCriswell, that works :D
[10:40:00] <pandemic> xrdodrx: $('form').submit(function(e) { // DO SOMETHING });
[10:40:06] <pandemic> something like that work for you?
[10:40:07] <BillCriswell> xrdodrx: .on('submit') should be just fine. Must be something else going wrong.
[10:40:53] <xrdodrx> http://sicp.tv:8080/mturk/writing.html
[10:40:55] <xrdodrx> this is the page
[10:41:23] <xrdodrx> it works with no .submit()
[10:41:28] <BillCriswell> xrdodrx: You don't do it on the submit button, you do it on the form.
[10:42:07] <xrdodrx> still doesn't work
[10:42:27] <xrdodrx> I changed it to $("form").on('submit',function()...
[10:42:36] <BillCriswell> Your form is commented out.
[10:42:46] <xrdodrx> oh, still?...yeah...
[10:42:50] <shoky> it would help if the submit button wasn't disabled..
[10:43:03] <shoky> oh ya and that ;p
[10:43:08] <xrdodrx> perfect :)
[10:43:17] <xrdodrx> i commented it out to test something quick and never uncommented it
[10:43:28] <pandemic> haha
[10:43:33] <xrdodrx> then spent fifteen minutes wondering why I couldn't $('form').submit()
[10:43:45] <xrdodrx> so i started testing .on('click')...the joys of coding :p
[10:43:48] <imsky> time to spam your mturk form
[10:43:51] <jyg> 2
[10:43:56] <imsky> "There was a problem submitting your results for this HIT."
[10:43:57] <xrdodrx> rofl imsky
[10:44:08] <xrdodrx> it won't do anything
[10:44:10] <imsky> make my spamming easier damn you
[10:44:14] <xrdodrx> you need to accept it on mTurk
[10:44:20] <xrdodrx> ;)
[10:44:24] <imsky> i can ddos your server tho
[10:44:25] <imsky> right?
[10:44:33] <xrdodrx> you can't ddos amazon
[10:44:35] <xrdodrx> i don't think
[10:44:39] <xrdodrx> go ahead and try though :)
[10:44:41] <imsky> sicp.tv is amazon?
[10:44:44] <xrdodrx> no
[10:44:49] <xrdodrx> mturk externalsubmit is
[10:44:53] <xrdodrx> you can ddos me, i suppose...
[10:44:57] <xrdodrx> i don't know why you would
[10:45:01] <garciawebdev> what's the difference between .find() and .children() ?
[10:45:16] <shoky> garciawebdev: .children() is only for direct children
[10:45:27] <pandemic> find is descendants correct?
[10:45:28] <garciawebdev> thanks shoky
[10:45:44] <shoky> yas
[10:45:57] <BillCriswell> I wanna go hooomeeee =(
[10:46:18] <shoky> to the womb
[10:47:09] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[10:48:19] <imsky> stuck at your job eh
[10:48:53] <BillCriswell> You bet.
[10:49:04] <BillCriswell> At 4 we usually sneak out for beer.
[10:49:07] <imsky> do they pay you to capitalize and punctuate two-word sentences?
[10:49:49] <BillCriswell> I don't even know what you just asked.
[10:50:00] <imsky> lol
[10:53:03] <garciawebdev> pandemic, if you're interested, this is how I ended doing it, based on your help: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/CfyGr
[10:53:21] <BillCriswell> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2ZwIkYJ7QY can't wait to rent this.
[10:53:21] <pandemic> nice :)
[10:53:40] <garciawebdev> I had to decide that if it's a sub-container, it's .contextual should be direct child
[10:53:48] <garciawebdev> otherwise, it would be difficult
[10:58:13] <Yiq> How much data can you jQuery? If you jQuery a 10000 element list, will it be slow or of+verflow or soemthing?
[10:59:03] <BillCriswell> Yiq: Try it and see. =)
[10:59:37] <TelFiRE> who wants to build a 10,000 element list just to tias :P
[10:59:43] <imsky> me
[10:59:49] <imsky> for a cool $99
[11:00:37] <Yiq> yes but if that works it doesnt answer my question. is there a limit or just a hardware one?
[11:01:34] <TelFiRE> Any tips on how to build something like this without using jquery ui? http://jamesarosen.github.com/jquery-ui/demos/menu/ios-menu.html
[11:03:08] <BillCriswell> Yiq: I know of no limit.
[11:05:17] <TelFiRE> honestly if you have a list that big, there probably will be some slowness or lag, I mean probably way before that, but it really depends on what calculations you are doing and what's being displayed
[11:07:26] <Yiq> how do i form a xmlhttprequest. i have done jQuery,getJSON successfully
[11:07:42] <BillCriswell> Yiq: $.ajax() ?

[11:09:32] <imsky> get out
[11:09:39] <BillCriswell> Howdy.
[11:11:04] <jugstah> anyone here familiar with jquery tools and slidetabs?
[11:12:23] <Yiq> what is the $ ? short for ajax?
[11:12:58] <BillCriswell> Yiq: It's jQuery. I think you should start from scratch. http://docs.jquery.com/How_jQuery_Works
[11:13:30] <Kambfhase> Once you have read that ^ read this: http://www.learningjquery.com/
[11:14:00] <jugstah> firebug and console.log() is your best friend too
[11:14:00] <ajpiano> Yiq: http://jsperf.com/single-append-vs-many-appends
[11:14:24] <ajpiano> Yiq: how much you "touch" the DOM is a big affect on performance,

[11:14:52] <BillCriswell> 43,439... that's very specific.
[11:16:17] <wavez> Is there a way to select the entire page? I tried $('body').html();, and it almost works right.
[11:16:36] <pandemic> $('html').html() should work i think
[11:16:43] <wavez> I seem to be missing a character off the start of the document.
[11:18:03] <wavez> maybe it's just an issue with how I'm checking the string that it's producing.
[11:18:32] <pandemic> $('html').get(0).outerHTML, that will include all tags
[11:18:33] <wavez> I'm sending it to a php script using $.post and then I'm echoing it back by looping through all of $_POST
[11:18:44] <wavez> okay, I'll try that
[11:29:26] <rogues> hi!
[11:30:07] <rogues> I am new to jQuery and I was wondering if I could put my jQuery snippets in the html file like this onmouseover='$(this).fadeIn(600).css("display","block");'
[11:31:25] <BillCriswell> rogues: You can but it's not really good practice.
[11:33:10] <wavez> What method should I use to send a really large string to a php script on my server? I'm getting odd results when trying to send it with $.post()
[11:33:29] <azorai> odd results?
[11:33:41] <rogues> BillCriswell, well it's not working, is there something I am missing?
[11:34:09] <BillCriswell> Your exact example wouldn't work since it's not displaying.
[11:34:53] <rogues> so would I have to set opacity to 0 and then fade it in?
[11:35:01] <jugstah> you're better off putting that into a .js file or within <script> and call it
[11:35:32] <BillCriswell> rogues: You want to mouse over an invisible div and make it appear?
[11:35:34] <wavez> azorai, my long string is being broken. When I echo back the keys, it's portions of my string.
[11:36:01] <rogues> it's a menu element set to display none, i want to fade it in when the user hovers over the parent element.
[11:36:04] <bakers> if I do fadeOut(10000, callback) where callback is some custom function I wrote, is it possible to pass variables to callback?
[11:36:26] <jedimind> so i just built something for the first time in ~3 years without jquery
[11:36:35] <jedimind> ... 13,754 lines of js later
[11:37:20] <imsky> should have used backbone
[11:37:28] <imsky> it would have only been 12,754 lines
[11:37:54] <wavez> How can I send a string of html to my server?
[11:38:16] <jedimind> imsky, :)
[11:38:56] <imsky> i've been building things without jquery p successfully jedimind
[11:39:06] <jedimind> congratulations?
[11:39:10] <wavez> I have a long string that contains html, I want to send it to my server, like using $.post(), and I want to have my script receive the string intact.
[11:39:13] <jedimind> i didnt say mine was unsuccessful
[11:39:27] <BillCriswell> rogues: Probably your best bet.
[11:39:56] <rogues> BillCriswell, set display to block and fade it in?
[11:40:06] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[11:40:16] <rogues> ok, thanks. will try it out.
[11:40:56] <wavez> what am I doing wrong that might be getting me ignored?
[11:40:56] <imsky> jedimind, first time in 3 years? scared to dip your toe?
[11:41:51] <imsky> wavez not paying me the protection money
[11:41:58] <wavez> :)

[11:44:19] <imsky> we're better than twitter
[11:44:22] <imsky> i think
[11:44:34] <jugstah> i barely use twitter :p
[11:44:35] <abjorn> sup imsky my wiggla
[11:44:37] * abjorn wiggles
[11:44:42] <imsky> omg abjorn
[11:44:43] * imsky wiggles
[11:44:51] <imsky> IT IS A GOOD DAY!
[11:44:51] <BillCriswell> rogues: http://jsfiddle.net/mCRMB/ would be nice, eh?
[11:44:56] <abjorn> lol
[11:45:16] <abjorn> imsky: it's dramaweek at the gater, they're taking away our flex schedules
[11:45:26] <imsky> damn!
[11:45:31] <imsky> so you cant roll in at 1 PM anymore
[11:46:02] <jugstah> it's hard to get shit done when your coworker is just stumbling into work when you're just leaving.
[11:46:06] <abjorn> No, and I don't much care about that, but the reasoning behind it bullshit and/or shady. Also, if you're gonna take away one of the few major benefits to the job you should pay us more lol
[11:46:31] <abjorn> jugstah: It's not typically like that. We have each others phone numbers for a reason
[11:46:51] <imsky> there's always irc
[11:46:53] <TelFiRE> Any tips on how to build something like this without using jquery ui? http://jamesarosen.github.com/jquery-ui/demos/menu/ios-menu.html
[11:46:56] <abjorn> but i can see some rational reasoning behind it, and i dont care that much if i cant sleep as long as i want
[11:46:58] <jugstah> ahh, phone numbers don't do me any good
[11:47:00] <jugstah> im deaf
[11:47:01] <jugstah> :-)
[11:47:03] <imsky> sux bro
[11:47:10] <abjorn> there's always texting :3
[11:47:11] <imsky> abjorn, so you gonna be on irc every day now eh
[11:47:17] <rogues> BillCriswell, I know CSS transitions! Cool. But it's a horizontal menu, I think to fade in display block i'll have to use jquery, since css transition does not have anything for display block.
[11:47:17] <abjorn> no, why would i be
[11:47:40] <abjorn> well, i mean, i probably will be, i suppose
[11:47:49] <xckpd7> is it possible to loop through an object?
[11:47:53] <imsky> no
[11:47:55] <jugstah> css transitions don't work on old browsers so a fallback is good
[11:48:05] <xckpd7> imsky: you responding to me?
[11:48:07] <Kambfhase> xckpd7: fo-in loop
[11:48:08] <imsky> no
[11:48:17] <Kambfhase> *for in
[11:48:37] <imsky> damit man
[11:48:38] <xckpd7> imsky: you usually talk this much?
[11:48:40] <abjorn> for (var prop in obj) { if (obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)) { /* do something */ } }
[11:48:48] <imsky> xckpd7, who the hell are you
[11:48:56] <abjorn> WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE
[11:49:04] <xckpd7> haha I was hoping you'd say no yet again
[11:49:07] <imsky> WHO ARE YOUU
[11:49:10] <imsky> WHO ARE YOUU

[11:49:53] <BillCriswell> I just finished Twin Peaks for the second time, so it is Owl Week for me.
[11:50:05] <imsky> abjorn, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1oIUfPwsk0&feature=player_detailpage#t=74s

[11:50:48] <imsky> >:[
[11:50:57] <imsky> i'm so fucking dark and mean
[11:51:32] <Kambfhase> this is a place full of scum and villany
[11:51:52] <BillCriswell> All these people here helping other people achieve their goals... such scum bags!
[11:52:01] <jugstah> par for the course
[11:52:03] <BillCriswell> While completely ignoring their own!
[11:52:13] <jugstah> the anonymity of IRC allows for rampant villiany and scum
[11:52:26] <abjorn> imsky: lawl
[11:52:37] <some_dude> hai, any experienced datatable guys here?
[11:53:01] <abjorn> ive used it some
[11:53:06] <imsky> ive used it tons
[11:53:12] <jugstah> get to the point
[11:53:15] <jugstah> don't beat around the bush
[11:53:30] <abjorn> depends on what kind of bush it is
[11:53:40] <some_dude> cool, I wanna trim the width of text in the cells, so every row is only 1 line.
[11:53:45] <Kambfhase> what does bush have to do with this?
[11:53:52] <imsky> bush/romney 2013!
[11:54:09] <some_dude> FOXTROT UNIFORM...
[11:54:10] <jugstah> Romney/Snoop Lion 2013!
[11:54:19] * jugstah snickers
[11:54:22] <imsky> no
[11:54:24] <imsky> try again
[11:54:34] <imsky> 2013 isn't even an election year
[11:54:36] <imsky> stupid
[11:54:38] <some_dude> I DONT WANNA BEAT AROUND THE BUSH
[11:54:54] <jugstah> even if the bush is a woman?
[11:55:13] <some_dude> well not around it anways
[11:55:26] <jugstah> haha
[11:55:27] <imsky> you guise
[11:55:31] <imsky> what are you talking about
[11:55:35] <some_dude> datatables
[11:55:46] <imsky> ok
[11:55:50] <Kambfhase> rule 35, it also applies to jquery
[11:56:21] <jugstah> what's rule 35?
[11:57:00] <some_dude> imsky, so yea any ideas I wanna have uniform rows, so that every row takes only 1 line of text. no Idea how to go about it atm
[11:57:21] <Kambfhase> rule 35 applies iff rule 34 fails
[11:57:29] <BillCriswell> some_dude: What browsers do you need to support?
[11:57:48] <BillCriswell> There is text-overflow in CSS which might be able to help? http://www.quirksmode.org/css/textoverflow.html
[11:58:29] <jugstah> I hate new clients.. I can never find their ftp info.. goddamn production department flunkies are useless... brb...
[11:58:53] <some_dude> BillCriswell, all of them hopefully :)
[11:58:55] <BillCriswell> I hate usernames and passwords more than anything.
[11:59:58] <Kambfhase> passwords are a pain in the ass.
[12:00:15] <some_dude> BillCriswell, altho anything older than IE 8 can bite me.
[12:00:29] <Kambfhase> its impossible to make them safe and to remember them at the same time
[12:01:14] <Lanubya> hi. how can I convert a normal variable to an array? (example: test1 == entry1,entry2)
[12:01:40] <Kambfhase> test1 = [ entry1, entry2]
[12:02:10] <BillCriswell> 'entry1,entry2'.split(',') ?
[12:02:57] <Kambfhase> whats the url to that lean javascript beginners online book?
[12:03:17] <Lanubya> nono i mean: i get the normal variable via $_POST..so the variable test1 is defined alrdy.
[12:03:27] <Kambfhase> the logo is a pheasant or something
[12:03:27] <NoiseEee> Kambfhase: eloquentjavascript.net
[12:03:41] <Kambfhase> yeah, thx.
[12:04:10] <sporkf> moin.
[12:04:42] <Kambfhase> moin moin
[12:04:42] <sporkf> How can I select on the test of <a>foo_text</a> to call .is(':visable') on it?
[12:04:53] <sporkf> 's/test/text/'
[12:05:45] <Kambfhase> $("a:contains('text')").is(":visible") may be
[12:06:03] <Lanubya> i guess i solved my problem: $test2 = explode(",", $test1);
[12:06:06] <sporkf> $("a:contains('foo_text')").is(":visible")  ??
[12:06:14] <BillCriswell> Lanubya: That's PHP bud.
[12:06:22] <Lanubya> yup
[12:06:24] <BillCriswell> sporkf: Yup.
[12:06:37] <TimTim`> hmm
[12:06:57] <TimTim`> i wonder if sporkf is having the same problem as me
[12:07:09] <TimTim`> can't seem to do this with jquery:
[12:07:24] <TimTim`> $('.multipleElements').is(':hover')
[12:07:32] <sporkf> thanks! It worked.
[12:07:46] <NoiseEee> TimTim`: what's that supposed to be doing?
[12:08:00] <BillCriswell> TimTim`: I see what you're trying to do but not sure it exists.
[12:08:01] <TimTim`> checking if at least one of the elements in the set has the hover pseudoelement
[12:08:12] <Kambfhase> TimTim`: :hover is not a valid selector
[12:08:13] <some_dude> BillCriswell, tried the CSS white-space: nowrap;
[12:08:13] <some_dude> 	width: 100%;
[12:08:13] <some_dude> 	overflow: hidden;
[12:08:13] <some_dude> 	text-overflow: ellipsis;  - doesn't work , it does put text in one line but the table width goes well outside the screen to the right, and well breaks the layout completely :/
[12:08:23] <jugstah> I hate it when I forget to screen my irc client
[12:08:28] <TimTim`> do i need to create a new function?
[12:08:31] <NoiseEee> some_dude: set limits on the table width.
[12:08:42] <BillCriswell> some_dude: I'm not sure dude. Only thing I can think of is going through each TD and manually adjusting it's content. =(
[12:08:47] <TimTim`> $('#singleElement').is(':hover')
[12:08:48] <TimTim`> works
[12:09:13] <some_dude> NoiseEee, k I'll set fixed tab width depending on the screen, see how that goes
[12:10:48] <TelFiRE> Hey all, is there an easy way to wait for my animation to complete before executing next command inside a function
[12:11:17] <nvartolomei> TelFiRE, it's called callback I suppouse
[12:11:24] <NoiseEee> TelFiRE: http://api.jquery.com/animate/ "complete" callback
[12:12:22] <some_dude> NoiseEee, tried setting the width of the element that wraps datatables. the problem is datatables doesn't give a damn about the wrapping element, seem to be positioned absolutely :/
[12:13:56] <adlwalrus1> Hi, could anyone review this and say whether it should work with oldIE? https://github.com/amccollum/jar/blob/master/src/index.coffee (it's not complex, only a simple cookie store.)
[12:15:47] <TimTim`> any suggestions for an efficient/flexible fix for this problem?  http://jsfiddle.net/9VVtt/
[12:16:23] <jyg> when you don't load any of the UI styles for dialog, the modal option doesnt work?
[12:16:35] <TimTim`> just wondering if jquery has a single native function that will do that or if i need to make one -_-
[12:16:48] <Kambfhase> TimTim`: why not abbend and a mouseover handler to the corresponding elements and change the text?
[12:16:53] <Kambfhase> *append
[12:17:40] <TimTim`> well that's not really what i want to do
[12:17:54] <TimTim`> just changing the text in the demo for demo purposes
[12:18:20] <TimTim`> i only care about the $('.multipleElements').is(':hover') check
[12:19:19] <Kambfhase> TimTim`: do you really want to do that check once a second?
[12:19:23] <TimTim`> no
[12:19:26] <TimTim`> just for demo purposes
[12:19:43] <Kambfhase> wait, ill code somthing
[12:20:18] * jugstah is giving his boss the skype (finger)
[12:20:43] <TimTim`> basically what's happening in my realworld situation is that some other mostly irrelevant event in another element is checking to see if multiple other elements have the hover pseudoclass
[12:21:16] <TimTim`> *at least one of the other elements have the hover pseudoclass
[12:23:48] <TimTim`> here's another fiddle where i toggle a class called "hover" and it works
[12:23:57] <TimTim`> but i'd rather not do that to every element -_-
[12:24:06] <TimTim`> http://jsfiddle.net/9VVtt/1/
[12:24:51] <nvartolomei> Why not to attach hover event handelrs?
[12:25:06] <jedimind> they're spindly
[12:25:22] <TimTim`> strange that $('.multipleElement').is('.someClass') works but $('.multipleElements').is(':somePseudoClass') does not
[12:26:20] <TimTim`> bug imo
[12:26:53] <Kambfhase> :hover is not a valid selector
[12:27:04] <TimTim`> if it's not a valid selector
[12:27:06] <TimTim`> why does this work
[12:27:28] <Kambfhase> pure luck
[12:27:38] <TimTim`> $('#singleElement').is(':somePseudoClass')
[12:27:44] <TimTim`> that works just fine
[12:28:09] <Kambfhase> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ << sinc :hover is not on that page you should not use it.
[12:29:02] <TimTim`> why isn't it on that page -_-
[12:29:12] <TimTim`> whattafucks friend
[12:29:26] <BillCriswell> I blame the president.
[12:30:04] <astropirate_> Anyone looking for a freelance JS/jQuery/Node.js/C++/Qt developer? PM me please :)
[12:30:07] <imsky> i blame BillCriswell
[12:30:14] <BillCriswell> I blame imsky.
[12:30:19] <imsky> YOU CANT BLAME ME
[12:30:23] <imsky> IM INNOCENT
[12:30:33] <jedimind> astropirate_, try #css-lance not in here
[12:30:39] <jedimind> also, portfolio
[12:31:29] <Kambfhase> TimTim`: this works: http://jsfiddle.net/9VVtt/2/
[12:31:54] <TimTim`> yeah i don't wanna do that
[12:32:03] <TimTim`> thanks though
[12:32:16] <TimTim`> i'll just replace the "is" function
[12:32:23] <TimTim`> with my own :P
[12:32:56] <Kambfhase> good luck with that
[12:33:29] <TimTim`> no need for luck
[12:34:59] <BillCriswell> Magento would probably less painful to develop with if we didn't have it on a shit server.
[12:36:02] <snover> nope
[12:36:04] <snover> magento sucks
[12:36:15] <snover> you can’t fix it with hardware
[12:36:18] <NoiseEee> dude he will kill you
[12:36:21] <NoiseEee> oh, not magneto
[12:36:39] <snover> wat
[12:36:39] <b-ot> In the name of Alah,Hi all,I want to simulate keypress is there any solution?
[12:37:09] <jugstah> .click?
[12:37:23] <jugstah> .trigger?
[12:37:50] <jugstah> jQuery.Event("keypress
[12:37:53] <jugstah> )?
[12:38:01] <jugstah> :-)
[12:39:15] <BillCriswell> snover: Wish I knew why everyone wanted it so bad.
[12:43:20] <Kambfhase> Is anyone using that jMath plugin? I heard it makes math in javascript alot easier.
[12:44:55] <Kurei> Hey! the .val() function doesn't return an value when the input has a value when the page is loaded.
[12:45:05] <Kurei> How can i solve this? :/
[12:45:09] <imsky> yes it does
[12:45:19] <imsky> just pay me 20 bucks and i'll enable the magic functionality
[12:46:53] <Kambfhase> you need to set the valOnLoad bit in the jq-header to 0x3F
[12:47:13] <Kurei> ahh .ready(function() { alert(this); } is undefined. It doesn't give you an object of the ready element.
[12:47:31] <Kambfhase> alert is not a debugger
[12:47:36] <Kurei> for me it is:P
[12:47:39] <imsky> is too!
[12:47:49] <imsky> i do alert(eval("hello world"))
[12:47:51] <Kambfhase> `object of the ready element` dafuq?
[12:48:39] <Kurei> "Object of the ready element" The element that i fetch for checking ready. "$(element).ready()
[12:49:11] <Kambfhase> element is usually document
[12:49:14] <imsky> take it outside
[12:49:16] <Kurei> for example, the click event has an Element object. the ready event doesn't
[12:49:42] <TimTim`> Kurei why are you using alert instead of console.log -_-
[12:50:05] <Kambfhase> all the pros use alert().
[12:50:17] <ezio> C++ programmers take it in the Class.
[12:50:30] <Kambfhase> JavaScript ninjas even serialize their objects and then alert it
[12:50:30] <Kurei> never heard of console log O_o
[12:50:44] <TimTim`> oh lawd
[12:50:44] <Kambfhase> ?ftj @ kurei
[12:50:44] <bot-t> kurei, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[12:50:46] <Kurei> Well, it works for me untill now :P
[12:50:56] <ezio> Kurei, please ... imediately learn debugging
[12:51:02] <TimTim`> you'll probably save a lot of time using the console
[12:51:10] <TimTim`> *undoubtedly
[12:51:23] <TimTim`> what browser(s) are you using
[12:51:39] <TimTim`> every modern browser has a console for debugging
[12:51:57] <Kurei> ohhhh
[12:52:01] <Kurei> That is a console log^^
[12:52:03] <Kurei> i use firebug for thatXD
[12:54:30] <Kurei> thanks anyway! cu^^
[12:56:48] <Yiq> u dont do var x = jQuery.get(foo); right? x bill be  nothing then? do something with the data in the callback?
[12:58:38] <quuxman> what insanity is this? Would someone please run: $.map(["0", "0", "0"], parseInt); // and explain the output?
[12:58:50] <jugstah> I hate having to clean up after other people's work
[13:00:07] <quuxman> why is that different than: $.map(["0", "0", "0"], function(v){ return parseInt(v) }); // ?
[13:01:23] <quuxman> I know JavaScript has some pretty ridiculous pitfalls, but this is on a whole new order of fucked
[13:02:00] <igcewieling> What is a good method to find out the type of a specific field in jquery?  i.e. input text, input checkbox, select, etc?
[13:02:39] <quuxman> how is "parseInt" not equivalent to "function(v){ return parseInt(v) }" ?
[13:06:18] <silverwind> quuxman: Simple.. parseInt takes more than one argument.
[13:06:37] <silverwind> The second argument being the base.
[13:07:39] <silverwind> ?js $.map([
[13:07:42] <bot-t> silverwind: SyntaxError: syntax error
[13:07:58] <silverwind> ?js $.map([0,0,0], function() { console.log(arguments); });
[13:07:59] <bot-t> silverwind: {}{}{}[]
[13:08:12] <silverwind> arg
[13:08:31] <silverwind> ?js $.map([0,0,0], function() { console.log(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)); });
[13:08:31] <bot-t> silverwind: [0, 0, undefined][0, 1, undefined][0, 2, undefined][]
[13:08:39] <TelFiRE> Hey guys, I'm getting some glitchy/artifacting type stuff... I am animating a div with borders and it results in 1 pixel vertical lines being all over after the animation completes. If you resize your browser or anything it gets rid of it. Example: http://jsfiddle.net/EQzM7/24/ (click one of the links, then go back to main menu to see glitch)
[13:09:58] <quuxman> silverwind: oh duh. Thanks
[13:10:39] <quuxman> silverwind: and of course jquery's map passes the index as the second argument, so it was getting base 0, 1, and 2
[13:12:02] <eregi> hi! what should I do to prevent jquery overwriting my variables? I have a hover function for .entry clases, in the mousein event I'm setting selectedId which is the id of $(this), but if I wiggle the mose over multiple elements the selectedId gets messed up.
[13:14:12] <TelFiRE> never mind, I guess this is just a Chrome rendering bug
[13:14:25] <TelFiRE> doubt anything can be done
[13:19:37] <iateadonut> how can i tell if an element has is shown or hidden after toggle()?
[13:21:06] <iateadonut> .is(:hidden)
[13:21:07] <iateadonut> jeez.
[13:21:11] <iateadonut> sorry to bother y'all
[13:23:55] <eregi> anyone, please?
[13:25:11] <se1fi> eregi: can you jsfiddle example?
[13:25:16] <se1fi> can you show*
[13:25:19] <eregi> selfi, sure
[13:27:47] <Kenaniah> Hi all, I'm attempting to fix bug #5559, which is an issue with the way resizable handles deltas and width/height calculations
[13:27:54] <eregi> se1fi, can I just pastebin the JS? Re-creating the html part will take a while, but you'll be able to understand the problem anyway. Still, if you need it, I'll try to..
[13:28:11] <Kenaniah> and I have a question about the implementation of width()
[13:28:22] <se1fi> eregi: pastebin is fine i think
[13:28:30] <Kenaniah> does the value returned by width() change according to the current box-model?
[13:29:07] <Kenaniah> more like, when width is set, isn't that subject to the CSS box-sizing property?
[13:30:04] <eregi> se1fi, http://pastebin.com/c72iCcyP I think that the problem is that 'selectedId' gets overwritten..
[13:31:44] <TelFiRE> is there a way to simply reset all original css for a certain element?
[13:32:09] <TelFiRE> or do you just have to re-do the calculations of where it should be
[13:33:48] <indeh> how would i convert p.filters into a URL query string?  $.param doesn't seem to be working for me http://jsfiddle.net/89eC4/

[13:42:25] <MaxymiserTE> nvm
[13:42:32] <garciawebdev> looking at the code, it's supposed to trigger a "selected" event, but it's not working...

[13:51:18] <jugstah> good weekend folks, im outta.
[13:51:26] <Kurei> Hey guys, how can i select inputs by name which are children of an id. $('#idname:input[type="checkbox"]') doesnt work, $('#idname').find('input[type="checkbox"]') doesn't work either ?

[13:52:59] <Guest___> this is how i code bitches
[13:53:51] <Progster> lol
[13:54:14] <Progster> what is the "default" or most currently used jquery validation plugin? I see entries anywhere from 3 - 5 years ago
[13:55:00] <NoiseEee> Kurei: http://jsfiddle.net/zCaX8/
[13:55:05] <ericelliott> Progster: I'm biased. http://ericleads.com/h5validate/
[13:56:15] <Kurei> weird...
[13:56:24] <Progster> looks like ericelliott
[13:56:33] <Progster> or is it ericleads ?
[13:57:04] <ericelliott> I'm confusing. =)
[13:57:12] <Progster> i hope your code isn't :)
[13:57:35] <ericelliott> https://github.com/dilvie/h5Validate/blob/master/jquery.h5validate.js
[13:57:40] <ericelliott> it is if you look at the author name.
[13:58:19] <Progster> I assume elliot is your middle name
[13:58:41] <Progster> jquery feels really segmented, when trying to look for things like a plugin
[13:58:50] <Progster> especially since their plugins page is down
[13:59:08] <ericelliott> Eric Elliott is my name.
[13:59:14] <ericelliott> Eric Hamilton is my old name.
[13:59:32] <Progster> and Eric Leads is the name you wish you had? :P
[13:59:37] <ericelliott> ericleads was a domain I registered when I could get erichamilton.com
[14:00:07] <ericelliott> it's my "crap I can't figure out a domain name that doesn't totally suck" name.
[14:00:27] <Kenaniah> anyone here really familiar with the internals of resizable? trying to fix a core bug...
[14:01:05] <ericelliott> couldn't get erichamilton.com
[14:02:16] <ericelliott> lots of people use h5validate... especially for shopping carts that require highly-configurable, user-friendly validation.
[14:02:27] <Progster> neato
[14:02:34] <Progster> how long of an effort was it for you to make?
[14:02:42] <ericelliott> but I haven't had a chance to update it in a while, and it's lagging behind, particularly on support for new input types.
[14:03:18] <ericelliott> I spent a lot of time on the code, and a lot of time on survey, analysis, user testing, etc...
[14:03:18] <Progster> there's no jquery default validation plugin? Don't want to add any new dependencies if I can avoid it
[14:03:32] <ericelliott> um, no.
[14:03:38] <Progster> was it related to any of your own projects? how'd you get involved in it?
[14:03:41] <ericelliott> but the only dependency in h5validate is jQuery.
[14:04:31] <ericelliott> I wrote h5Validate for one of my project. Later I added it to Zumba.com's shopping cart and dramatically reduced shopping cart abandonment (people were getting stuck in the shopping cart due to poorly thought-out validation)
[14:04:46] <ericelliott> since then it has been added to many shopping carts
[14:05:07] <ericelliott> about 70 million people / month pass through forms validated with h5validate
[14:05:24] <ericelliott> just counting the projects I know of.
[14:06:48] <ericelliott> it's a little stale, but still very capable, and I'm open to help if you want to improve it.
[14:07:04] <Progster> wow that's neat.
[14:07:11] <Progster> must've taken a lot of time to get right
[14:07:17] <ericelliott> it did
[14:08:57] <ak> ah ericelliott i would have just needed something like this a month ago >.<
[14:09:01] <Progster> i'll check it out
[14:34:03] <oliverrattue> Can't figure out this var scope issue - http://paste.qth.fr/index.php/view/18031902 - need to get the value of data.status outside of the function. Can't see how to do this...
[14:34:23] <chovy> how would i randomly replace a string in a text? ie: <p>foo bar foo baz foo</p> I want to just randomly replace 1 occurrence of 'foo' with 'buz'
[14:47:56] <vladikoff> oliverrattue, you need to wait for a callback
[14:47:56] <MistuhKurtz> oliverrattue, you need to initialize the var outside of the function, then you can assign the value inside the function, and have it be available outside of the function
[14:48:44] <vladikoff> MistuhKurtz, that's not the case, he is doing waiting for a success callback, he just alerts it RIGHT after the call
[14:48:48] <oliverrattue> MistuhKurtz: I did that. var status; then assigned within function, but it's not available outside...
[14:50:13] <vladikoff> oliverrattue, http://fixingthesejquery.com/images/ajax101.png
[14:51:29] <oliverrattue> vladikoff: thanks.
[14:52:22] <oliverrattue> Now just to work out how to apply that logic.
[15:01:47] <oliverrattue> vladikoff: thanks for clearing the concept up in my mind. All fixed :)
[15:02:45] <vladikoff> oliverrattue, welcome :)
[15:03:07] <ericelliott> oliverrattue: you should google jQuery.deferred
[15:03:32] <oliverrattue> reading thanks.
[15:04:13] <ericelliott> all ajax functions now return deferreds in jQuery
[15:04:21] <ericelliott> promises, rather
[15:04:51] <ericelliott> which is great, because you can attach any number of callbacks to them that will be executed when the data is received and the promise gets resolved
[15:05:30] <ericelliott> var whenDataReceived = $.ajax(options);
[15:05:50] <ericelliott> later... whenDataReceived.done(callback1);
[15:05:55] <ericelliott> later... whenDataReceived.done(callback2);
[15:06:14] <ericelliott> later... whenDataReceived.fail(handleErrorCallback);
[15:07:16] <ericelliott> you can also group multiple calls together.. $.when(promise1, promise2, promise3).done(doTheNextThing);
[15:08:15] <ericelliott> Even better, you can use deferreds for anything you want. var whenTimeout = $.Deferred();
[15:08:43] <ericelliott> setTimeout(function () { whenTimeout.resolve(); }, 1000);
[15:12:25] <ericelliott> You can also use them to normalize return values.. so instead of throwing an error when things don't go as expected, you can reject a promise, and then the caller can use a declarative style to call your method: doThing(options).done(cb).fail(handleFail);
[15:19:15] <DreamHack> Anyone up for giving me a quick lesson?

[15:26:07] <laurenty> in jqueryui autocomplete is there a way to get the search term from a 'search' event handler?
[15:27:09] <laurenty> the docs state that the function receives event and ui, but no words on getting the search term
[15:30:19] <WinVery> ah java http://winvery.com
[16:11:25] <zapsoda> how do i make this loading page happen as soona s the page loads rathen then once the dom are done

[16:19:44] <FrozenFire> How can I get the width of an element including its overflow?
[16:20:53] <tw2113> .width?
[16:20:56] <tw2113> .innerwidth?
[16:21:32] <Kenaniah> FrozenFire: I think you'd probably have to get the width of a block-level child element
[16:21:56] <FrozenFire> Essentially, what I have is a ul with a bunch of li's for a menu.
[16:22:12] <FrozenFire> I'm progressively enhancing it to turn the scrollbars into buttons on the sides
[16:22:23] <FrozenFire> I need to know the width of the inside, so I don't scroll too far
[16:22:31] <FrozenFire> There are many children
[16:22:34] <Kenaniah> You can add a <div>, test its width and then remove it
[16:23:04] <FrozenFire> That'd probably go screwy, visually.
[16:24:13] <Kenaniah> FrozenFire: you should be able to do the entire operation in a single render
[16:24:25] <Kenaniah> you won't even see it
[16:26:34] <FrozenFire> It'd seem that the added element scales to the width of the parent - but not the overflow
[16:26:35] <Kenaniah> the least amount of impact would probably be to append the div with "visible: hidden;"
[16:27:06] <Kenaniah> what's your overflow setting?
[16:27:09] <Kenaniah> none?
[16:27:51] <FrozenFire> Hrmm, what I did, which seems to work, is this:
[16:28:13] <Kenaniah> you may be asking for the scollWidth then
[16:28:15] <FrozenFire> var innerWidth = 0; $("li", menu).each(function() { innerWidth += $(this).width(); });
[16:28:18] <Kenaniah> *scrollwidth
[16:28:37] <Kenaniah> FrozenFire: careful, that's subject to the box-sizing model you're using.
[16:29:04] <Kenaniah> try document.getElementByID('whatevah').scrollWidth
[16:29:50] <FrozenFire> Hrmm, good thinking.
[16:29:57] <zapsoda> how do i make this loading page happen as soona s the page loads rathen then once the doms are done
[16:29:58] <zapsoda> http://ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout/
[16:30:09] <FrozenFire> I got 1501 with my method, 1667 with scrollWidth
[16:30:45] <Kenaniah> .width() may not take into account borders / margins due to the currently-effective box model
[16:31:02] <Kenaniah> which, BTW, is browser-specific (FF is content-box, Chrome is border-box)
[16:32:02] <Kenaniah> so you'll want to be extremely careful with .width() as it will give you a different answer based on the defaults of the browser if you haven't explicitly set a box model to use
[17:23:45] <LordThumper> How can I do this selector?
[17:24:06] <LordThumper> $(this).add("#foo")
[17:24:08] <LordThumper> In one?
[17:25:32] <LordThumper> If it is even possible
[17:26:00] <ajpiano> it isn't
[17:27:48] <LordThumper> Ok thanks, was trying $(this, "#foo") before I noticed what I was doing wrong, which took a couple of minutes... :p
[17:31:20] <LordThumper> Also, what is this exactly?
[17:31:22] <LordThumper> $({})
[17:31:53] <LordThumper> Is it an empty jQuery object?
[17:32:15] <LordThumper> Couldn't really google it because of special characters

[18:01:40] <Ayush> Good Morning
[18:05:21] <ML74> does anyone have an ajax tab script that they could recommend?
[18:10:40] <mparodi> Hello
[18:11:08] <mparodi> I'm doing an AJAX request but jquery is not calling any of the handlers. what can be wrong?
[18:11:32] <mparodi> (the request is successful)
[18:11:49] <shoky> mparodi: pastebin/demo
[18:11:53] <mparodi> ok
[18:12:44] <mparodi> http://paste.debian.net/184321/
[18:12:48] <mparodi> do you want the real code?
[18:13:00] <mparodi> or was it just to check how I'm doing it?
[18:13:32] <shoky> the real code
[18:13:49] <mparodi> ok, it's not so much different, wait a minute
[18:14:00] <mparodi> http://paste.debian.net/184322/
[18:14:04] <mparodi> http://comoir.montevideo.gub.uy/stmWEB/
[18:14:09] <mparodi> in this page ^
[18:14:43] <mparodi> (it's not mine, I'm trying to use it..)
[18:14:59] <shoky> how do you know the request is successful?
[18:15:10] <mparodi> because I can see the response in Firebug
[18:15:20] <mparodi> I mean, I'm logging it and it's fine
[18:15:31] <mparodi> but nothing is printed
[18:15:40] <shoky> oh you gave the site link too
[18:15:53] <mparodi> as you can see here: http://wstaw.org/m/2012/08/18/plasma-desktopuF3648.png
[18:16:28] <mparodi> the code I gave you is just an example but as you see it should be working...
[18:17:04] <mparodi> it doesn't make sense :|
[18:17:40] <mparodi> ohhh, wait!! it's calling the success handler but somehow it's not printing SUCCESS!!!
[18:17:49] <mparodi> I just put an alert and it worked
[18:18:53] <mparodi> it's so weird! I can't print anything with console.log() in that page O.o
[18:19:12] <shoky> uhh
[18:19:34] <shoky> you have firebug.js there
[18:19:42] <mparodi> really?
[18:19:42] <shoky> overwriting the native console object..
[18:19:56] <mparodi> ohh, I didn't realized
[18:19:58] <mparodi> realize*
[18:20:04] <shoky> something is overwriting it, anyway
[18:20:16] <mparodi> yep
[18:20:48] <mparodi> well, anyway. I don't need console.log, I was using it just to test the script
[18:20:50] <mparodi> thank you shoky
[18:21:02] <shoky> mparodi: http://comoir.montevideo.gub.uy/stmWEB/resources/OpenLayers-2.6/lib/Firebug/firebug.js
[18:21:13] <shoky> of course you need console.log
[18:21:23] <mparodi> yes, I just saw that script
[18:21:31] <mparodi> no, I don't need console.log
[18:21:55] <mparodi> just in this test, not in the real code :P
[18:22:04] <shoky> for testing, yes
[18:22:11] <shoky> nvm ;p
[18:27:41] <mparodi> I have another question
[18:28:01] <mparodi> this page uses lot of id like foo:bar:123
[18:28:13] <mparodi> but I can't use the selector '#foo:bar:123'
[18:28:24] <mparodi> I tried escaping the ":" with \ but it doesn't work either
[18:28:27] <mparodi> any idea?
[18:28:33] <shoky> escape with \\
[18:29:00] <mparodi> ah, it works
[18:29:06] <mparodi> why \\ and not just \, shoky ?
[18:29:44] <shoky> because \\ means "one slash character"
[18:30:03] <shoky> (in javascript)
[18:30:13] <shoky> and also because the docs say so: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[18:30:20] <shoky> read the top text
[18:30:36] <shoky> ?js "\:"
[18:30:38] <bot-t> shoky: ":"
[18:30:43] <shoky> ?js "\\:"
[18:30:44] <bot-t> shoky: "\:"
[18:30:57] <mparodi> I see
[18:31:12] <ScottG> Is there a way to simulate an event? For example I want some event to fire when a user changes the value of a dropdown. However, I also want to fire that event when my code automatically changes the value of that check box.
[18:31:44] <mparodi> ScottG, what event?
[18:31:52] <shoky> ScottG: you just want to fire your handler? (as opposed to simulating the native event)
[18:32:37] <shoky> ScottG: you can use .trigger()
[18:32:51] <shoky> ScottG: or if it's a click for example you can just .click() it
[18:33:05] <shoky> (that'll also call the native .click() on the element)
[18:33:50] <shoky> or you can just give your callback a name and call it
[18:35:30] <ScottG> When my user clicks on the dropdown and changes the value to "a" I want to display what was picked in the dropdown (in this case "a"). Now some other code goes and changes the selected value in that checkbox to "b". Now I want what's selected in the dropdown to also display somewhere.
[18:36:43] <shoky> if you binded to the change event,
[18:37:12] <shoky> then you can call .change() on the dropdown to trigger the event
[18:38:49] <ScottG> shoky: I wasn't aware you could actually call events
[18:39:14] <shoky> ScottG: you can trigger events, yes
[18:40:33] <zapsoda> Ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout   how do i make the loading screen come up first

[18:42:30] <mottihoresh> what do you guys think about design specs as interview stage?
[18:42:43] <mottihoresh> do you think it makes any sense?

[18:54:47] <ML74> Having some problems with this script: http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex17/ajaxtabscontent/. Can't seem to get it working on my page (http://http://glistrr.com/system/tablet/admin/). Anyone able to have a look?
[18:55:13] <zapsoda> Ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout   how do i make the loading screen come up first
[19:19:55] <coldhead> can't believe you're still banging on about this, zapsoda
[19:20:25] <zapsoda> Me either :(
[19:30:20] <zapsoda> coldhead,
[19:30:22] <zapsoda> any ideas?
[19:46:50] <shoky> zapsoda
[19:46:57] <shoky> put this in the top of your <body>
[19:46:58] <shoky> <div id="zapsoda" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; background-color: #fff989; background-position: fixed; position: fixed; z-index: 666998; top: 0; left: 0;"><div style="height: 40px; width: 100px margin-top: -60px; position: absolute; font-size: 3em; top: 50%; left: 50%; text-align: center; margin-left: -50px; color: blue">Loading 0%</div></div>
[19:47:03] <shoky> and then STFU
[19:47:15] <zapsoda> :O
[19:47:23] <shoky> oh and you need to $('#zapsoda').remove() it when that loading crap is done
[19:48:09] <zapsoda> gonna tell me how to do that last part shoky ?
[19:48:48] <tw2113> callback function
[19:48:49] <tw2113> ?
[19:49:29] <shoky> zapsoda: in your .queryLoader2() call, add an option:    onComplete: function() { $('#zapsoda').remove() }
[19:49:33] <shoky> i guess
[19:53:51] <shoky> zapsoda: but the critical thing is to understand what happens when, and if you chose the right plugin for the job (by knowing what the plugin does, and when)
[19:54:07] <igcewieling> are dots allowed in selectors like $('#reg.1.auth.userId').  It doesn't seem like it, but I could be doing something wrong.
[19:55:35] <shoky> zapsoda: or sorry, not what the plugin does.. but WHEN it is supposed to be used. (e.g. in a DOM ready handler. which is no good for a page like yours)
[19:55:38] <igcewieling> I have a corrosponding element with an id="reg.1.auth.userId" but $('#reg.1.auth.userId').length is 0
[19:56:05] <shoky> igcewieling: you need to escape them with \\
[19:56:19] <zapsoda> ok
[19:56:19] <zapsoda> so
[19:56:20] <zapsoda> <div id="zapsoda" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; background-color: #fff989; background-position: fixed; position: fixed; z-index: 666998; top: 0; left: 0;"><div style="height: 40px; width: 100px margin-top: -60px; position: absolute; font-size: 3em; top: 50%; left: 50%; text-align: center; margin-left: -50px; color: blue">Loading 0%</div></div>
[19:56:22] <coldhead> don't use .s in your IDs
[19:56:22] <zapsoda> in the top
[19:56:26] <zapsoda> of the body
[19:56:31] <coldhead> why make your life hard
[19:56:55] <zapsoda> Now what?
[19:57:12] <shoky> now you should be seeing the loading crap right away
[19:57:35] <igcewieling> coldhead: I was trying to avoid massaging the json element names
[19:58:14] <igcewieling> the json comes in with items like ["reg.1.authId"]  = "whatever"
[19:58:14] <shoky> zapsoda: btw that loader doesn't work for me, it shows 0% then waits for images to load and jumps to 100% and closes
[19:58:25] <coldhead> gotta massage them element names to get them dollas
[19:58:27] <zapsoda> shoky, same here
[19:58:29] <zapsoda> its ok
[19:58:34] <shoky> if you say so
[19:58:37] <zapsoda> shoky, it doesnt go away now
[19:58:41] <zapsoda> http://ashersprogramming.org/test/
[19:58:48] <shoky> right, i told you what to do about that
[19:59:17] <igcewieling> shoky: thanks.  I think it would be easier to replace the .'s with _ in the json data
[20:00:05] <shoky> fine, go with coldhead's solution!
[20:00:24] <coldhead> zapsoda: shoksy has written you so much code, let him do something else now. try and fix it on your own like a big grown up boy.
[20:00:28] <tw2113> zapsoda, you need to put $('#zapsoda').remove() in a function that gets run on completion of loading
[20:01:12] <tw2113> you also need to use <p> tags
[20:01:19] <tw2113> and make that box scrollable by mouse
[20:01:20] <tw2113> :P
[20:01:43] <shoky> zapsoda: another option is to put $('#zapsoda').remove right after (or before) your call to .queryLoader2(...)
[20:01:44] <tw2113> well, trackpad/scrollwheel
[20:02:07] <shoky> zapsoda: because that zapsoda div is no longer needed once your loader junk is running, on DOM ready
[20:02:13] <zapsoda> Which would you suggest and i think once im done with this im gone so you dont have to worry about me
[20:02:16] <igcewieling> shoky: your information was the most useful.  It told me one way or the other I'd have to massage the data.  If I have to massage the data anyway, then I prefer using _
[20:03:39] <shoky> yeah so you used my information and went with coldhead's advice anyway. i see.
[20:03:57] * tw2113 hands shoky a beer to wallow in
[20:03:59] <shoky> (i do hope you sense the sarcasm)
[20:04:15] <shoky> tnx tw2113
[20:04:37] <iateadonut> I have an array something like this:
[20:04:37] <iateadonut> {"ainfo":[{"account_id":111, ... },{"account_id":222, ... }]}
[20:04:40] <tw2113> nooooooooooooooooooo...sarcasm?
[20:04:48] <shoky> it requires brainz sry
[20:04:50] <tw2113> :D
[20:05:12] <iateadonut> how can i traverse the subarrays with a for(x in whatever)... ?
[20:05:55] <igcewieling> shoky: I sense the humor. 8-)
[20:07:04] <iateadonut> $.each( array.ainfo )... or what?
[20:07:05] <shoky> iateadonut: use $.each
[20:07:07] <shoky> yea
[20:07:14] <shoky> though that's not an array ;P
[20:07:25] <iateadonut> that's JSON data, yeah.
[20:07:26] <iateadonut> oh.
[20:07:58] <shoky> i mean the parent object, not ainfo
[20:08:34] <shoky> iateadonut: $.map and $.grep might come in handy too
[20:11:39] <igcewieling> jQuery is the greatest thing since puppies.
[20:13:14] <zapsoda> shoky,
[20:13:15] <zapsoda>     var destroyQueryLoader = function () {
[20:13:15] <zapsoda>         $(qLimageContainer).remove();
[20:13:15] <zapsoda>         $('#zapsoda').remove();
[20:13:15] <zapsoda>         qLoptions.onLoadComplete();
[20:13:17] <zapsoda>         qLdestroyed = true;
[20:13:21] <zapsoda>     };
[20:13:25] <zapsoda> Still not working
[20:13:26] <zapsoda> :(
[20:13:31] <zapsoda> http://ashersprogramming.org/test/
[20:13:31] <shoky> ?? wtf is that
[20:13:47] <shoky> what did you do there..
[20:13:52] <shoky> destroyQueryLoader ??
[20:13:53] <zapsoda> the part that destroys the loading page from before
[20:14:00] <zapsoda> i added
[20:14:00] <zapsoda>  $('#zapsoda').remove();
[20:14:24] <shoky> inside the queryLoader plugin ..?
[20:14:30] <zapsoda> Yes
[20:14:41] <shoky> :\
[20:14:57] <shoky> who said that this destroyQueryLoader is being called?
[20:15:33] <zapsoda> because i think thats whats called when it open open the loading screen
[20:15:38] <zapsoda> opens*
[20:15:42] <shoky> zapsoda: put $('#zapsoda').remove()  inside your DOM Ready handler, the same place where you're calling .queryLoader(...)
[20:15:51] <shoky> 2
[20:16:06] <shoky> don't just edit plugins man
[20:16:12] <shoky> without knowing what yer doing
[20:18:00] <iateadonut> what is the value of the element in an array 'array', like array['accountId']?
[20:18:16] <shoky> iateadonut: hmm?
[20:18:40] <shoky> that's an object, not an array
[20:19:00] <iateadonut> just that.
[20:19:08] <iateadonut> shoky, thanks. i've already parsed it into an array
[20:19:24] <shoky> no idea what your question meant..
[20:20:01] <iateadonut> so, the value of the element is exactly what i wrote. i thought it was not like this in javascript.  sorry... it's probably just too late.  you really helped when you said that string wasn't an array though earlier so thanks very much.
[20:21:15] <tw2113> dot syntax ftw
[20:21:25] <zapsoda> shoky, still not working heres where its called
[20:21:26] <zapsoda> $(document).ready(function () {
[20:21:26] <zapsoda> 	$('#zapsoda').remove();
[20:21:26] <zapsoda>     $("body").queryLoader2({
[20:21:26] <zapsoda>         barColor: "blue",
[20:21:26] <zapsoda>         backgroundColor: "#fff989",
[20:21:27] <zapsoda>         percentage: true,

[20:21:33] <zapsoda>     });
[20:21:37] <zapsoda> });
[20:22:36] <shoky> zapsoda: that should work.. i don't see that code in the link you gave tho
[20:22:46] <zapsoda> ashersprogramming.org/test  ?
[20:22:50] <shoky> yes
[20:23:30] <zapsoda> <script src="http://www.ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout/script/script.js"></script>
[20:23:45] <shoky> exactly
[20:23:47] <shoky> go to http://www.ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout/script/script.js
[20:23:56] <tw2113> zapsoda, change this });
[20:23:56] <tw2113> });
[20:24:28] <zapsoda> Arnt those the same thing tw2113
[20:24:34] <tw2113> and add $('#zapsoda').remove(); in between them
[20:24:45] <tw2113> }); $('#zapsoda').remove(); });
[20:24:48] <tw2113> right at the end
[20:25:03] <shoky> either should work
[20:25:16] <tw2113> aka add $('#zapsoda').remove(); right before the closing }); for the document.ready() part
[20:25:16] <shoky> but zapsoda that url is still not updated
[20:26:37] <zapsoda> oh
[20:59:44] <devslash> is anyone here
[21:00:02] <mrgenixus> hi there; what is the most vanilla way to access drag events? and why aren't they supported in the standard lib?
[21:00:12] <mrgenixus> devslash: dunno
[21:00:41] <devslash> http://pastebin.com/aA1zL8HL theres my code thats an event for my button
[21:01:01] <devslash> I'm getting an error on line 5. do you see anything wrong with that code
[21:01:48] <mrgenixus> you error is on like 3
[21:01:55] <mrgenixus> you never closed the click method call
[21:02:07] <devslash> ahh thanks
[21:02:08] <mrgenixus> line 3 should be });
[21:02:10] <devslash> bonehead
[21:02:14] <mrgenixus> am not..
[21:02:23] <devslash> no i am
[21:02:37] <mrgenixus> good luck
[21:21:01] <devslash> this is my site http://mms-test.no-ip.org/test/. when you click on the top folder button it changes color. how do i modify the color that it changes to ?
[21:30:29] <arnpro> can javascript expressions be stored in arrays? for example $("#input1").val()  + " -  " $("#input2").val(), I'm trying to do that so I can pass it to a Math Parser class... because those expressiones are made dinamically
[21:33:23] <iateadonut> i'm trying to get a single input field $('input.nameOnCard')  within the div addAccountTableDiv (which is = $(node).parent().nextAll('.'+type); is a <div> and i can change it to the color red with the command addAccountTableDiv.css('background', 'red'); ) - but i cannot find the input field through addAccountTableDiv.nextAll('input.nameOnCard');
[21:33:47] <iateadonut> can anyone tell me how to find the input.className within the div?
[21:38:39] <Dexter_> anyone about?
[21:40:27] <Dexter_> I have an ajax callback that binds to the submit on a form. How can I tell if there is already a bind on that event?
[21:49:53] <fris> Dexter_ hasData() maybe?
[21:50:02] <fris> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.hasData/
[21:52:45] <sahbeewah> no you can't (efficiently) determine what's binded so you should find a workaround
[21:53:33] <Dexter_> K it binds the same thing multiple times everytime the ajax returns
[21:53:55] <Dexter_> so I have multple bind('submit',function(){}) events.
[21:54:03] <Dexter_> I only want one.
[21:57:57] <sahbeewah> without know what you're trying to achieve, at the very least you can create a flag variable to check whether it's been binded
[22:04:00] <Dexter_> sahbeewah: I'm trying to inject some javascript into an application.
[22:04:58] <Dexter_> I don't have access to change the global code I can only develop for the portion that comes in through the ajax callback
[22:05:35] <Dexter_> eveytime the ajax loads the form all of my code is reloaded.
[22:05:42] <jrockjiggz> $.getScript(); i believe
[22:06:25] <Dexter_> jrockjiggz: I'm trying to bing once to the parent form
[22:06:32] <Dexter_> bind not bing
[22:07:18] <jrockjiggz> bing, bong..same thing
[22:07:54] <Dexter_> bing bong bind.
[22:08:22] <jrockjiggz> so use on() delegates to handle eelements that may/maynot exist yet.. if your form reloads, the binding should be remain
[22:08:31] <jrockjiggz> and if the binding is replaced, all should be good
[22:09:19] <ruby_on_tails> hello
[22:09:36] <Dexter_> everytime the form reloads (via ajax) the form submit event gets bound again
[22:10:01] <zapsoda> Im back.....
[22:10:13] <Dexter_> so if I throw an alert on the bind function it fires once for every time the form is reloaded.
[22:10:26] <Dexter_> so if I reload the form 5 times. I get 5 consecutive alerts
[22:20:52] <jrockjiggz> Dexter_: are you using on() or click() ?
[22:21:06] <jrockjiggz> on('submit') or .submit() or live('submit') ?
[22:21:33] <jrockjiggz> if live, you can use:   .die('submit').live('submit', function(){ ... }); to erase any previous bindings
[22:22:40] <danmichel> hey guys, I'm getting TypeError: $ is not a function
[22:22:40] <danmichel> http://varmag.com/nysextrash/wp-content/themes/invictus/js/jquery.superbgimage.min.js?ver=3.4.1
[22:22:40] <danmichel> Line 224 http://varmag.com/nysextrash/#
[22:23:06] <danmichel> 	
[22:23:06] <danmichel> $.superbg_interval = setInterval("$(this).nextSlide()", options.s
[22:25:54] <jrockjiggz> danmichel: try jQuery.fn.startSlideShow = function($)
[22:26:03] <jrockjiggz> or.. replace $ with jQuery
[22:26:18] <danmichel> thanks jrockjiggz. brb
[22:29:10] <jrockjiggz> gtg, bbiab
[22:29:16] <danmichel> I'm sorry jrockjiggz, i don't know anything about javascript
[22:29:21] <danmichel> really wuick
[22:29:39] <danmichel> I'm replacing $.superbg_interval = setInterval("$(this).nextSlide()", options.slide_interval); with jQuery.superbg_interval = setInterval("$(this).nextSlide()", options.slide_interval);
[22:29:40] <danmichel>  jrockjiggz?
[22:31:41] <danmichel> or jQuery.fn.startSlideShow = function() with jQuery.fn.startSlideShow = function($)? jrockjiggz?
[22:32:24] <danmichel> or jQuery.fn.startSlideShow = function() with jQuery.fn.startSlideShow = function(jQuery) {?
[22:35:08] <tw2113> jQuery.fn.startSlideShow = function($)
[22:39:56] <danmichel> thanks tw2113. happy birthday
[22:40:11] <danmichel> that gives me 'TypeError: $ is undefined' though tw2113
[22:40:30] <tw2113> so nowhere new
[22:40:56] <danmichel> was not a function before. now 'undefined'
[22:41:30] <danmichel> http://pastebin.com/x0LnZHCW
[22:42:56] <tw2113> my next step would be changing $ to jQuery
[22:44:23] <danmichel> tw2113 back to 'not a function with 'jQuery.fn.startSlideShow = function(jQuery) {	'
[22:44:52] <tw2113> shouldn't need to pass it in
[22:45:04] <danmichel> not sure what that means
[22:47:30] <tw2113> function() not function(jQuery)
[22:49:03] <danmichel> line 211 was 'jQuery.fn.startSlideShow = function()' to begin with tw2113
[22:49:34] <_zoggy_> escape $?
[22:50:22] <danmichel> where would i be changing the character '$' with the word 'jQuery' in http://pastebin.com/x0LnZHCW tw2113?
[22:50:39] <danmichel> I'm confused. i just followed what you said
[22:50:45] <tw2113> if you see $ you change it to jQuery
[22:50:56] <tw2113> every one
[22:51:10] <tw2113> except the first one
[22:51:16] <tw2113> you can just remove that one
[22:51:25] <scathen^C> hey all, I have created a canvas that I want to fill the entire screen, but even though i have dont that (using widht:100
[22:51:35] <scathen^C> %, etc
[22:51:47] <scathen^C> the canvas element still has a width of 300?
[22:51:56] <danmichel> ok, brb
[22:53:41] <danmichel> ok, changed it to http://pastebin.com/AWxu4chx tw2113
[22:54:50] <danmichel> and that worked. thanks tw2113 _zoggy_
