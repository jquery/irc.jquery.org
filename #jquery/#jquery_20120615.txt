[00:00:22] <thomasfedb> Hey. I'm usuing .sortable from jQuery UI. How can I extract the element was was moved on drop?
[00:29:06] <Bevis> hi, everyone. how can i handle all ajax request when request completed by global setup, must *before* success event,  like .ajaxComplete, but ajaxComplete will be called after success.
[00:34:08] <mindis|work> hello guys. i have a bunch of text inputs and divs that contain dates. i'm trying to implement a search that would find these inputs and divs based on a start and end date and i was wondering if anyone knew of any jquery shortcuts for searching through them before i start writing loops myself
[00:36:34] <MrTool> @mindis: maybe it would help you, i solved my search with an Array of and jQuery.map
[00:39:54] <MrTool> @mindis: at first create an array with an key => value pair where the value is the string with info you wana search in
[00:39:59] <thomasfedb> I've got this strange problem where $.ajax seems to be trunicating my url. It apears to be related to having numbers in the url./
[00:40:03] <MrTool> @then
[00:40:29] <thomasfedb> And it only happens when I use type: "PUT" rather than type: "GET"
[00:40:39] <mindis|work> MrTool well actually i have a slightly different solution but thanks :)
[00:46:37] <Whirl3d> What is the difference between creating an object like var f=new objectFunction()   and var f=objectFunction () { return this;}   ?
[00:49:28] <Whirl3d> and if I use var f=new objectFunction() {  var obj=this; this.init();}   how can i access init if I am inheriting it through prototype inheritence..objectFunction.prototype.init=function () { }
[00:51:29] <sshow> Hey! How do I access the eventData within an object .click([eventData], handler); ?
[00:54:32] <Whirl3d> $(elem).click(function(e) { e is the event data }); ?
[00:54:40] <mindis|work> yes
[00:57:48] <Bijsterz> Can anyone help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/vsfEu/
[00:58:24] <Bijsterz> THe event handlers aren't working, there is no docs on how to do this with .on()
[00:58:58] <Whirl3d> Bijsterz, the problem with your event handler is that you are using $(this)...when bound to the document.
[00:59:41] <Whirl3d> I think you want to do it like this: $(document).on(funcName, function (e) { var targ=$(e.target);
[00:59:58] <hooloovoo> Bijsterz: what exactly do you intend $(this) to be?
[01:00:11] <Bijsterz> input[type=file]
[01:00:12] <Whirl3d> or better would be $(document).on("click", ".someClass", function (e) { $(this) is the target then
[01:00:37] <hooloovoo> Bijsterz: why aren't you binding the events to that?
[01:00:37] <Bijsterz> yeah but then i'd have to do every handler seperate
[01:00:53] <hooloovoo> ahhh
[01:01:11] <Whirl3d> $(document).on("change", "input[type=file]", function (e) {  $(this) is the input
[01:01:21] <Bijsterz> also i dynamicly add these inputs
[01:01:28] <Whirl3d> still works
[01:01:50] <Bijsterz> well, i'll do them seperately then, thanks
[01:02:00] <Bijsterz> stupid btw that it isn't possible
[01:02:06] <Bijsterz> this way
[01:02:09] <Whirl3d> because you are binding the event to the document, it doesn't know if the input is a new one or an old one. It just knows that one of its decendent inputs changed...for exaple
[01:02:23] <Whirl3d> what are you talking about?
[01:02:43] <Bijsterz> according to jquery docs this is the way to do .live now
[01:02:44] <Whirl3d> You were close, you just needed to add the context to your on handler
[01:02:52] <sshow> Whirl3d: thanks!
[01:03:08] <Whirl3d> did you read anything that I have been typing to you?
[01:03:18] <Whirl3d> Bijsterz, ^
[01:03:30] <Whirl3d> you can do it and you were doing it almost right
[01:04:18] <Bijsterz> yes, but i cant do .on({ change: function(){}, mouseenter: function(){} }
[01:04:37] <Whirl3d> you can if you get the target from the event
[01:05:00] <Bijsterz> i have to do .on('change', 'input[type=file]', function(){}
[01:05:03] <Bijsterz> ?
[01:05:21] <Whirl3d> $(document).on({change:function (e) {targ=$(e.target);}, mouseenter:function (e) {targ=$(e.target);}});
[01:05:31] <Bijsterz> ah ok now i understand :)
[01:05:35] <Whirl3d> LIke I said, you can do it either way
[01:05:47] <Whirl3d> to use the object notation, you can't have the middle context selector
[01:05:47] <Bijsterz> sorry i'm just starting with jqueyr
[01:06:22] <Whirl3d> so you are stuck using e.target...or binding several ons...one for eeach event
[01:16:46] <Hereisanotherlie> is it pretty standard to use the full form of $(document).ready(); ?
[01:17:13] <ENQ> how to call a function with unknown amount of parameters, but not with apply, example: http://fiddle.jshell.net/ew58d/
[01:17:26] <ENQ> without apply*
[01:18:03] <Bijsterz> Whirl3d: I've changed it now according to what you said but it is still not working http://jsfiddle.net/vsfEu/2/
[01:18:05] <tw2113> Hereisanotherlie i'm starting to use jQuery(document).ready(function($) { to avoid conflicts
[01:18:10] <tw2113> but i do a lot in WordPress too
[01:18:16] <Whirl3d> use the arguments object
[01:19:07] <ENQ> just arguments?
[01:19:25] <Hereisanotherlie> i don't see how using jQuery over $ would prevent conflicts
[01:19:43] <tw2113> WordPress is often in noconflict mode
[01:19:46] <Whirl3d> in your case you are prolly gonna want the arguments (except the first one) so you would use Array.prototype.slice.apply(arguments, 1);
[01:20:04] <tw2113> and i pass in the $ so that I can use it inside the ready()
[01:20:25] <Hereisanotherlie> I think people tend to use (document).ready over an anonymous function purely for readability
[01:20:44] <Whirl3d> Bijsterz, I have never worked with input[type=file] elements before so I don't know if they have a change event and/or if it propagates...
[01:20:56] <ENQ> yes Whirl3d, but this returnss an array of arguments, so i should use fnction.apply Array.proto... and my functions will get first parameter witch will be array
[01:20:57] <Cork> Hereisanotherlie: $ is used by many other frameworks jQuery is more uniq
[01:21:14] <ENQ> or am i missing something?
[01:21:37] <Hereisanotherlie> Cork: that makes sense, I didn't know that was the case
[01:21:48] <Bijsterz> They do have a change event, i'll check if the propagate, they also have a mousenter/leave and i guess they propagate, their not working either
[01:22:00] <Cork> Hereisanotherlie: prototype, and a few smaller snippets use it
[01:22:46] <Whirl3d> arguments is an array...of sorts I believe
[01:23:39] <ENQ> hmm
[01:24:13] <Whirl3d> does it show jquery as your selected framework. For me it shows mootools...
[01:24:56] <Bijsterz> Whoops, doesn't make a difference though: http://jsfiddle.net/vsfEu/4/
[01:26:28] <Whirl3d> might be "input[type='file']"
[01:26:44] <Whirl3d> nope
[01:27:59] <Aidanie> I'm attempting to parse some JSON using getJSON but I'm getting a "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier" error. You can find my code and JSON response here: http://pastie.org/4091092
[01:28:12] <Aidanie> What am I doing wrong?
[01:28:50] <Whirl3d> haha...no '' around document
[01:28:57] <Whirl3d> $(document).on(...
[01:29:06] <Whirl3d> not $("document").on
[01:29:22] <Bijsterz> pffff
[01:29:26] <Whirl3d> Bijsterz , http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/vsfEu/11/
[01:29:45] <Aidanie> Woops, the error actually happens on the third line. So the line directly after feed :
[01:29:49] <Bijsterz> Thanks, now i know i'm not fully awake yet..
[01:29:50] <Aidanie> Meaing "{" is causing it.
[01:31:22] <Whirl3d> aidanie, try not enclosing the property in ""   feed: {stuff}   rather than "feed": {stuff...   I'm not sure that's the problem, but it might be
[01:32:37] <Aidanie> Whirl3d: Thanks, upon looking at my code further though it appears the problem is caused by me using JSONP when the server doesn't support it
[01:36:47] <Aidanie> Anyone have any idea how I'd get over cross domain AJAX requests using XML?
[01:36:56] <Aidanie> Server doesn't support JSONP and I have no way of editing it
[01:48:08] <superchu> Aidanie: setup a proxy on your server that parses the url you want to request
[01:48:23] <superchu> and then you do your ajax-request to your local proxy
[01:49:43] <Aidanie> superchu: Cool, thanks.
[01:49:50] <superchu> np

[02:14:15] <Naeblis> hello. I'm using head.js to pass a function implementing a select2 box.
[02:14:49] <Naeblis> is there a way to pass another function which shows and hides the box on click in the same head.js?
[02:17:34] <Cork> Naeblis: best tips i can give is look though its source code
[02:31:35] <premapix> Hi All. With a page including several iframes, how do I get to talk from an element in one Iframe to another -- any ideas appreciated
[02:33:42] <ravenzz> hey why this.$win is undefined within the _adjustPosition method? http://jsfiddle.net/8TjHB/
[02:34:15] <Nece228> hello
[02:34:29] <Nece228> how to write something in a form?
[02:34:42] <ravenzz> what do you mean Nece228?
[02:35:05] <Nece228> i have an input form, when i press a button which has a number id, i want to write that button id to input form
[02:35:27] <Nece228> i mean jquery should write it, not me
[02:36:39] <mindis|work> $('yourinput').val(whateveryouwantasvalue);
[02:36:52] <Zitter> hi, does someone recognize this jq plugin http://www.yootheme.com/widgetkit/examples/slideset ?
[02:37:41] <Nece228> ah thanks it works
[02:38:05] <premapix> Hi - With a page including several iframes, how do I get to talk from an element in one Iframe to another -- any ideas appreciated
[02:38:15] <Nece228> but if i press button two times i want to write that button id number two times
[02:38:29] <Nece228> but it deletes the previous one
[02:38:45] <NodeX> anyone remember the hotkey in firebug to show what jquery handlers are bound to elements ?
[02:39:27] <mindis|work> Nece228 $('yourinput').val($('yourinput').val() + whateverelseyouwantasvalue); veeerrry basic programming
[02:40:55] <ravenzz> at this point you would save $('yourinput') in a var. var $yourinput = $('yourinput'); $yourinput.val($yourinput.val() + whateverelseyouwantasvalue);
[02:44:21] <Nece228> thanks for that
[02:45:48] <ravenzz> Cork why can't I access the options / this.$win in the _adjustPosition method http://jsfiddle.net/8TjHB/1/ ?
[02:46:37] <ravenzz> I mean, I can within the init method, why I am not able to do so there?
[02:47:28] <Nece228> ravenzz: mind i ask you why its var $yourinput and not var yourinput?
[02:48:57] <ravenzz> there is no difference, it is you to remind you that $yourinput is a jQuery object
[02:49:13] <ravenzz> but you can user yourinput as well
[02:49:18] <Nece228> ok
[02:49:25] <Flo0815>  hey guys, question about .live an .on: i'm loading a html content via ajax. this contains a #button. $('#button').live() does work but $('#button').on() not (it's in $(document.ready()). why?
[02:49:28] <ravenzz> I mean is up to you
[02:49:29] <Nece228> but $yourinput is a better practice i see
[02:49:35] <ravenzz> yeah
[02:50:42] <mindis|work> Flo0815 it's supposed to be buttonscloseststaticparent.on('eventname', '#button', function() { alert('blaa!'); });
[02:50:58] <Flo0815> oh ok
[02:51:19] <Flo0815> thx
[02:51:37] <mindis|work> np
[02:53:17] <Cork> ravenzz: where do you get that its not accessable?
[02:53:25] <Cork> *accessible
[02:54:15] <ravenzz> well open the console and try to resize the window
[02:54:19] <ravenzz> (the result panel)
[02:54:37] <Cork> uh... what window?
[02:55:09] <shoky> Zitter: what do you mean
[02:55:09] <ravenzz> the jsfiddle result panel
[02:55:16] <Cork> ah, the full window
[02:55:42] <ravenzz> yep it is supposed to be the window ;)
[02:57:36] <Zitter> shoky, a plugin to do something like that
[02:58:52] <shoky> Zitter: nivo slider ?
[02:58:52] <Paulloz> hi there
[02:59:11] <Cork> ravenzz: your loosing the scop here this.$win.resize(self._adjustPosition);
[02:59:12] <Zitter> shoky, maybe, dunno. Anyway, thanks :)
[02:59:20] <Paulloz> i got a little question for you guys
[02:59:29] <shoky> Zitter: ok so try ;p
[02:59:43] <Cork> ravenzz: replace it with this.$win.resize(function(event) { self._adjustPosition(event); });
[03:00:36] <mindis|work> Paulloz that's a statement, where's the question ;P
[03:00:40] <Paulloz> i'm building a dom element with jQuery and i want ir's html string
[03:00:42] <Paulloz> it's*
[03:00:53] <Paulloz> so 'im using .prop('outerHTML')
[03:01:09] <ravenzz> Cork yep I was afraid of that. but I didn't know that passing the event would have give me the scope again.
[03:01:13] <ravenzz> how that works?
[03:01:14] <Paulloz> but is there a way to get a string with the onClick handler ?
[03:01:43] <Cork> ravenzz: when your doing resize(self._adjustPosition) your passing the function as reference
[03:01:59] <Cork> ravenzz: that means it losses all object relation
[03:02:15] <Cork> ravenzz: if you wrapp it in an anonymous function you call it on the object again
[03:02:17] <ravenzz> ok, but do I need to pass the event?
[03:02:37] <ravenzz> I mean i think that i don't need to pass it
[03:02:49] <ravenzz> do i?
[03:02:53] <Cork> ah, you mean the event argument?
[03:02:57] <ravenzz> yes
[03:03:04] <Cork> no, i just added it for completeness
[03:03:17] <ravenzz> I see. k thank you
[03:03:20] <Cork> np
[03:03:36] <ravenzz> ah I have another question, it is more about the design
[03:03:50] <ravenzz> what belongs to the constructor and what to the init method?
[03:04:31] <Cork> ravenzz: when ppl use init functions you normally don't put anything in the constructor
[03:04:43] <Cork> *they normally
[03:06:08] <ravenzz> isn't the constructor's mission to "construct" the object and then i can have some initialization login into the init method?
[03:06:21] <ravenzz> logic*
[03:06:33] <youngin> what's up Cork, ravenzz
[03:06:50] <youngin> any of you gentlemen interested in rewriting http://www.professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom.htm for $100?
[03:06:51] <Cork> ravenzz: you can look at it that way if you like
[03:07:47] <youngin> i'd rather ask my fellow irc'ers to do it than some random stranger on odesk =)
[03:07:55] <Nece228> a crazy question
[03:08:02] <youngin> that cloud zoom is way too big and messy..
[03:08:04] <ravenzz> eh ask on #css-lance
[03:08:13] <youngin> ravenzz: cool
[03:08:15] <Cork> Nece228: there is no crazy questions :)
[03:08:22] <Nece228> is there any function which will calculate everything i just give a data of string
[03:08:24] <Nece228> for example
[03:08:38] <Nece228> '5+6-2+10'.calculate();
[03:08:51] <Cork> ?eval eval('5+6-2+10')
[03:08:55] <bot-t> Cork: 19
[03:09:16] <Cork> though be careful it will run any js function too
[03:09:40] <Nece228> wow, i didnt think jquery has something like that, thanks
[03:09:41] <Cork> ?eval eval('document.createElement("div")')
[03:09:42] <bot-t> Cork: ReferenceError: document is not defined
[03:09:52] <Cork> Nece228: its not jquery
[03:09:57] <Cork> that OLD native js
[03:10:02] <Nece228> oh
[03:10:10] <Nece228> anyway
[03:10:12] <Cork> and normally a bad idea
[03:10:25] <Nece228> its always gonna be numbers
[03:10:46] <Cork> ?g eval is evil

[03:11:30] <dfssss> ho are u

[03:12:03] <dfssss> hi
[03:12:37] <dfssss> can any one help me for stringfy is not working in any ie7
[03:13:02] <Cork> ?g json2 @ dfssss
[03:13:04] <bot-t> dfssss, douglascrockford/JSON-js · GitHub - https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
[03:13:12] <Cork> wtf...
[03:13:15] * Cork hits bot-t
[03:14:18] <Cork> ah, they've moved it to git
[03:14:44] <Cork> dfssss: you need to include json2.js to make it work in ie7
[03:18:22] <Nece228> Cork: but as i understand theres no better alternative to eval right?
[03:19:17] <timing> Hi all! with JSONP, how does one identify which response is from which request?
[03:19:25] <timing> do you send a different callback with each request?
[03:19:55] <timing> or do you queue all requests so you only send one at the time?
[03:20:47] <shoky> it's all about timing!
[03:21:55] <timing> haha
[03:21:56] <timing> shit
[03:21:58] <shoky> umm
[03:22:02] <shoky> i donno much about JSONP
[03:22:09] <shoky> but i think jquery does that for you..
[03:22:24] <timing> ok, will look into that
[03:22:34] <shoky> i mean
[03:22:56] <shoky> you know what request the response belongs to because you specify the success/done callback
[03:23:22] <timing> yeah but if it's the same everywhere?
[03:23:30] <timing> or is that bad practice anyway?
[03:23:36] <timing> *everytime
[03:24:50] <Naeblis> I want to perform an operation when a select2 entry is selected. Any ideas how I can do that?
[03:26:10] <mindis|work> ummmh, you mean you want something to happen when a certain option is selected in a select element?
[03:26:20] <Naeblis> yeah
[03:26:34] <NodeX> switch(foo.val()) { ...
[03:27:12] <Naeblis> hmm
[03:27:22] <Naeblis> it's not about any particular option,
[03:27:51] <Naeblis> 'any' option will do. Basically, I want to hide the select once an entry is selected
[03:28:09] <NodeX> if(foo.val()!='') { ...
[03:28:18] <mindis|work> then you probable want to use http://api.jquery.com/change/
[03:28:31] <NodeX> after change ^^ of course
[03:28:58] <Naeblis> thanks. Will look into it
[03:31:30] <shoky> timing: http://jsfiddle.net/fwMSF/1/
[03:32:00] <Cork> Nece228: you can split the string and handle it like that instead
[03:32:28] <Cork> Nece228: that way you can limit what can be done
[03:33:20] <Nece228> i was thinking about that
[03:33:24] <Nece228> but im not sure how to do that
[03:33:46] <shoky> timing oops.
[03:36:17] <timing> shoky: sweet, thanks
[03:37:16] <shoky> timing i forgot to make it actually do jsonp ;p
[03:37:23] <g[r]eek> Hi fellas. I have a group of checkboxes. Their name is checklist[] and each has a unique value assigned to it. I'd like to get an array of values of the checked boxes. Is there a built-in method to do this? If not, what's the quickest way? Thanks
[03:37:46] <timing> shoky: o really, it looked so awesome
[03:38:16] <shoky> timing: http://jsfiddle.net/fwMSF/2/
[03:39:26] <g[r]eek> fwiw, these checkboxes are all in a form called foobar
[03:39:34] <g[r]eek> perhaps I can serialise it somehow?
[03:40:04] <Cork> g[r]eek: simplest is prob to do it your self
[03:40:12] <Cork> you can get it with serializeArray
[03:40:18] <Cork> but you would have to loop it anyway
[03:40:31] <shoky> $.map plX
[03:41:31] <Cork> g[r]eek: var checklist = $.map($('input[name="checklist[]"]'), function(elm) { return $(elm).val() });
[03:42:07] <g[r]eek> Cork, thanks but this seems to do the trick too, perhaps I'm missing something or I miscommunicated my question: http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[03:42:23] <Cork> g[r]eek: that'll give you a param string
[03:42:26] <Cork> not an array
[03:42:53] <g[r]eek> Cork, ok I see, pardon my badly worded question in that case, it's a param string I was after. Thanks for the help nonetheless :)
[03:42:59] <youngin> yo Cork whats up
[03:43:05] <Cork> so it'll give you checklist[]=val1&checklist[]=val2&checklist[]=val3
[03:43:08] <Cork> as a string
[03:44:09] <youngin> why aint u saying nothing man?
[03:44:15] <shoky> youngin sup

[03:45:19] <youngin> you're right im sorry
[03:45:30] <shoky> ;
[03:45:39] <shoky> oops
[03:45:41] <youngin> interesting smiley
[03:45:44] <youngin> never seen that one before
[03:45:47] <shoky> ;-D
[03:45:48] <youngin> just the eyes
[03:45:52] <youngin> oh
[03:45:54] <youngin> i liked ; better
[03:45:59] <Cork> youngin: as soon as your getting to something ontopic i'll prob answer
[03:46:20] <youngin> cool thanks in advance man
[03:46:55] <shoky> youngin freelancers for whut?
[03:47:07] <youngin> shoky: i need http://www.professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom.htm rewritten
[03:47:37] <shoky> the plugin?
[03:48:37] <youngin> yes sir!
[03:49:19] <shoky> pretty slick plugin
[03:49:27] <youngin> oh yeah
[03:49:32] <youngin> but a bit too big and messy for my taste though
[03:49:45] <youngin> i dont know much about jquery, but i've seen beautiful jquery code and this ain't it
[03:49:50] <Vooloo> if you have an iframe inside jquery modal you get the 2 scrollbar problem. which can probably be solved. but if you resize the modal window, how do you resize the iframe to go with it?
[03:50:29] <Hereisanotherlie> thats a nice plugin
[03:50:40] <cog_> hi, I would like an equivalent of  .append but that returns the appended stuff. IS that possible?
[03:51:21] <cog_> I am doing a recursive building of a DOM tree, that's why.
[03:51:48] <Cork> cog_: var elm = $(html); target.append(elm);
[03:51:58] <youngin> shoky: permission to pm?
[03:52:03] <shoky> youngin sure
[03:52:08] <youngin> awesome
[03:52:35] <kelye> hello, can someone point me to a tutorial regarding event tracking ?
[03:52:52] <kelye> i want to do something like toggle but in a custom way
[03:53:42] <cog_> Cork, the point is that I am not using html code.
[03:54:12] <Cork> cog_: ok?
[03:54:48] <Cork> you can do elm.appendTo().some_other_action_on_elm
[03:55:43] <cog_> Cork, I would like :  elm.Append().some_other_action_on_appended_stuff
[03:56:00] <cog_> s/other//
[03:56:25] <Cork> cog_: either, what you append is a jquery object, then do appendTo and invert the relation in your code
[03:56:31] <Cork> or do the code i sent you
[03:56:35] <Cork> theres no other option
[03:58:14] <cog_> Cork: ok
[04:03:02] <Vooloo> wow it's hard finding good people for work.
[04:05:49] <NodeX> everyone is dumb by default!
[04:05:56] <daniel__> im trying store references to dom elements in an object so i can go back and add a css class to highlight them
[04:06:06] <daniel__> can't figure out if this will work
[04:06:26] <daniel__> so i let the user select a load of elements and store them in an object
[04:06:40] <daniel__> then i might remove the highlighting and store another load of elements in a different object
[04:06:55] <pangelovski> hi guys
[04:07:12] <daniel__> then i want to go back to the other object, for (var key in selections) { $(key).addClass() }
[04:07:15] <daniel__> not working
[04:07:32] <daniel__> the key is an xpath expression to the dom element for example
[04:08:29] <daniel__> arg, im an idiot
[04:08:30] <daniel__> nevermind
[04:09:47] <daniel__> thought that would fix it, it didnt
[04:10:41] <pangelovski> im new to jquery and im wondering how i would do to have one page showing the menus and one page to show the content? is this possible?
[04:14:18] <jkarsrud> what is the best way to prevent form submit in IE?
[04:15:11] <Cork> jkarsrud: $('form').submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault() ;});
[04:15:26] <jkarsrud> really doesn't seem to work here :/
[04:15:31] <Cork> it does
[04:15:53] <jkarsrud> then IE is screwed up about something else first then
[04:16:13] <Cork> ie's screwed up by design
[04:16:17] <jkarsrud> well, yeah
[04:16:23] <jkarsrud> but other than that ;)
[04:16:27] <Cork> :d
[04:16:38] <jkarsrud> this bug just bugs me :P
[04:17:11] <jkarsrud> works fine in all other browsers, and I'm doing is a check if a form is valid :P
[04:18:13] <Jagan_> Hi.....
[04:20:17] <Jagan_> I have a div element. I have to make that div  as child div by adding parent div to that?
[04:20:56] <Cork> Jagan_: try rephrasing that question
[04:21:10] <Hereisanotherlie> he wants to wrap a div in another div
[04:21:24] <JaredCE> afternoon all, i've got some code running that when a user clicks a button on the site, it sens an ajax request that then generates a file (excel/pdf), how can i serve the file back, so that FF/IE/etc asks the user whether they want to open or save it, within the ajax call?
[04:21:24] <shoky> yo dawg... heard u like divs
[04:21:45] <astropirate> lies
[04:21:56] <Hereisanotherlie> i miss tables
[04:21:56] <Cork> JaredCE: you can't use ajax for downloads
[04:22:22] <JaredCE> sucks to be me then
[04:22:29] <Cork> JaredCE: best is to just use window.open
[04:22:46] <Hereisanotherlie> Jagan_: take a look at http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[04:22:57] <Cork> that limits you to 1) doing it on click events, 2) get requests
[04:23:02] <Cork> JaredCE: ^
[04:27:35] <Naeblis> I'm trying to change the value selected with a select2 using this: var a = $("#tzname : selected").val() and then want to display it. $("#tzname").html(a); is not working.
[04:28:33] <fuchstronaut> Naeblis you want to change one dropdown based on the value of another?
[04:29:24] <Naeblis> no, I want to change the text value displayed on the page based on the selected choice.
[04:30:43] <fuchstronaut> (Naeblis): user .text() instead of html
[04:30:54] <jkarsrud> Jagan_: see ?wrap
[04:30:55] <kelye> what are event namespaces ? where can i find more info on that ?
[04:31:05] <shoky> ?on @ kelye
[04:31:05] <caniuse> kelye: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[04:31:45] <Naeblis> fuchstronaut, still no go. :(
[04:31:53] <wiherek> hi. I am trying to export a function using exports.function_name = function () {myfunction}; and I would like to load it through another file. In node.js i'd use 'require'. Whats the equivalent in jquery?
[04:32:12] <Naeblis> I should probably mention that the text is rendered by a jijna2 template
[04:32:15] <kelye> shoky: i am on that page but can't figure exactly
[04:32:43] <kelye> the namespace is specified by me ? and only the event counts?
[04:32:45] <fuchstronaut> (Naeblis): can you post some code? I see you are using the same ID for that dropdown and your textarea
[04:32:58] <kelye> or all the events are somehow namespaced ?
[04:33:09] <kelye> like 'click.button' .. all the clicks on buttons
[04:34:32] <Naeblis> fuchstronaut, http://pastebin.com/NqufqasM
[04:34:41] <Naeblis> and no, different IDs
[04:35:10] <shoky> kelye: yes its specified by you
[04:35:24] <kelye> did some tests, figured out, thanks!
[04:35:44] <Naeblis> I think it's the val() that is failing to get the value, because if I put quotes around newTime, it displays just fine.
[04:35:49] <fuchstronaut> (Naeblis): is it this you are looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/rqvEj/
[04:36:00] <shoky> kelye: for example..  $(element).on('click.mystuff', ...).on('keypress.mystuff',...);    ....    $(element).off('.mystuff');
[04:36:36] <kelye> how's this different from a custom event definition ?
[04:36:46] <kelye> oh, i think i got it
[04:36:57] <Naeblis> fuchstronaut, yes
[04:36:57] <kelye> you can work with the  default events.. like click
[04:37:04] <shoky> a custom event definition doesnt let you do that .off for all of mystuff events
[04:37:16] <kelye> ok, got it, thanks
[04:37:37] <shoky> also if you'd do .off('click')  instead of .off('click.mystuff')
[04:37:55] <shoky> then you might be unbinding a differnet click handler that you still need
[04:37:59] <shoky> etc.
[04:40:46] <fuchstronaut> (Naeblis): why dont you access the dropdowns value in the function passed to the event by using $(this).val()?
[04:41:44] <Naeblis> fuchstronaut, uhh...I'm kinda new to this.
[04:41:58] <Naeblis> using this isn't working.
[04:42:04] <fuchstronaut> to be honest i dont really understand what you are trying to do :)
[04:42:21] <Naeblis> exactly as the code you linked
[04:42:23] <fuchstronaut> but inside that function of your change-event "this" is the object that changed
[04:42:38] <Naeblis> I select the time in the dropdown, the text shows that time and offset
[04:42:42] <fuchstronaut> so you can access the dropdowns current value by $(this).val()
[04:44:11] <fuchstronaut> $('#tzselect').change(function(){ var selected = $(this).val(); });
[04:44:33] <fuchstronaut> and than you can do whatever you want with that selected variable
[04:45:07] <fuchstronaut> for example showing it in your div would be $('#tzoffset').text( selected )
[04:49:30] <Xotix> hi
[04:49:56] <fuchstronaut> hi
[04:50:25] <xec> hi
[04:51:06] <Xotix> http://pastebin.com/WfcL2g5k why does it split the string into its digits?
[04:51:15] <heke80> hi what can be wrong when jquery does not bind click ...  in js :  $('input[id*="option-value-"]').bind("change",  function() { alert('sdfsfsafd') }  );                             and  in HTML  there is                             <input type="radio" id="option-value-73" value="73" name="option[235]">
[04:52:00] <Cork> heke80: does the html exist in the page when your run the selector?
[04:52:26] <heke80> ok this was obvious ... need to set it ready :-p
[04:52:30] <xec> Xotix: you're looping a string?
[04:53:05] <Christer_> Does anyone use Coda2 ? And how do i get a split screen view with 2 different files..
[04:53:41] <Xotix> xec ctually i thought jQuery wil lcreate an array/obj out of it.
[04:53:52] <Xotix> data is a obj
[04:54:03] <Xotix> do i have to parse it again? hm
[04:54:07] <Cork> Xotix: if you want jquery to make that an image
[04:54:10] <xec> Xotix: make it a live demo
[04:54:10] <Cork> you need an img tag
[04:54:34] <Xotix> Cork of course but it isn't about that. was just wondering whx i don't get strings but digits. Okay i'll
[04:55:11] <Cork> the string is converted into an array
[04:55:21] <Cork> and each is then looping the array
[04:55:26] <xec> Xotix: http://jsfiddle.net/VEqbq/
[04:55:31] <Xotix> thats what i thought
[04:55:38] <xec> Xotix: isnt this what you would expect?
[04:57:20] <Xotix> So it worked correctly. hmm. In my console.log i got String and then it looks like an array and i'd have expected to see the string. anyway, my fault. Missread my console.log then. :)
[04:58:00] <Xotix> String is an Obj whereas each digits is a property?
[04:58:01] <Cork> ?eval for(a in "testing") { print(a) }
[04:58:01] <caniuse> Cork: null
[04:58:16] <Cork> thats basically what your doing
[04:59:02] <Cork> ?eval var output = []; for(a in "testing") { output.put(a); }; output
[04:59:02] <caniuse> Cork: 'TypeError: Object  has no method \'put\''
[04:59:07] <Cork> ?eval var output = []; for(a in "testing") { output.push(a); }; output
[04:59:08] <caniuse> Cork: [ '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6' ]
[04:59:12] <pachet> that's basically what your doing has wrought!
[05:06:15] <bLUEE> hi there.. why does jquery deposit cookies in my browser by default ?
[05:06:39] <Cork> deposit??
[05:08:05] <xec> bLUEE: if you can formulate your question to a yes/no question, we could make a completely wild guess about what you mean and still have a 50% chance of getting the answer right.
[05:08:56] <Cork> lol
[05:09:22] <bLUEE> well.. i clear my cookies for a site i am viewing. i reload a page. and i see jquery put 2 cookies there.
[05:09:27] <bLUEE> why did it do this...
[05:09:45] <xec> bLUEE: jquery doesn't do that on its own afaik
[05:09:53] <Cork> bLUEE: jquery doens't add cookies on its own
[05:10:09] <Cork> either the site has a plugin that does it, or the webserver does it
[05:10:15] <bLUEE> hmmm
[05:10:47] <bLUEE> yes might be a plugin then. the domain of cookie is .jquery.com
[05:11:31] <bLUEE> and name of cookie is __utmz
[05:11:56] <xec> google analytics?
[05:12:20] <Cork> ya
[05:12:30] <bLUEE> there is another one with the same name, but i assume that other one is google
[05:13:05] <Cork> i would assume both is google
[05:13:20] <bLUEE> but the domain is .jquery.com
[05:14:00] <Cork> do you have a link?
[05:14:53] <rbw> hello. are there any good plugins to limit the history size of i.e. a textarea?
[05:15:42] <dimaqq> is async jQuery.ajax data/error callback *guaranteed* to be called asynchronously? p.s. sorry if it seems a dumb question
[05:15:47] <Cork> rbw: js have very limited control of the users copy buffer, so i would guess at no
[05:16:24] <Cork> dimaqq: they are called when the call comes from the server
[05:16:37] <Cork> not sure what you mean by guaranteed
[05:17:09] <Cork> async means theres no guarantee
[05:17:14] <dimaqq> can I rely on it, as in xx = ajax(...);  // fire request ;; xx.callback= something_new;
[05:17:22] <bLUEE> Cork: you might be right..
[05:17:42] <dimaqq> that callback won't be called until js drops to the bottom of event loop
[05:18:05] <Cork> dimaqq: the success/complete callback isn't called until your function ends, if that what you mean
[05:18:19] <Cork> js is single threaded
[05:18:32] <dimaqq> Cork: thanks I think that's exactly what I mean. how about error callback?
[05:18:48] <Cork> every thing in js works this way
[05:19:01] <Cork> except if your using webworkers
[05:19:07] <dimaqq> I know that
[05:19:38] <dimaqq> I'm concerned that jQuery might decide to call my callback within the jQuery.ajax() call
[05:20:00] <Cork> dimaqq: ajax is just a wrapper around xmlhttprequest
[05:20:16] <Cork> a compatibility layer to make it work with both normal browsers and ie
[05:20:31] <Cork> and to prittify the syntax :)
[05:20:43] <dimaqq> ugh I guess I have to ensure that on all browsers then...
[05:20:56] <Cork> dimaqq: not really
[05:21:08] <Cork> the nature of js defines that
[05:21:16] <heke80> how to get selected value of  radio button ....  $('input[name="option['+ option.product_option_id +']"]'   ).val();   return allways the value of the first option ... :(
[05:21:21] <Cork> the callbacks from xhr is async
[05:21:44] <Cork> and async can only run one thread at a time in js
[05:22:17] <dimaqq> I'm trying to make a sensible API for my rpc, and I was thinking to eventually write code like this:
[05:22:39] <dimaqq> myrpc.login(<params>).callback = function (rv, err) { ... }
[05:22:54] <Cork> heke80: $.map($('input[name="option['+ option.product_option_id +']"]'), function(elm) { return $(elm).val(); });
[05:23:27] <Cork> dimaqq: that would mean exposing parameters that the user can set
[05:23:32] <Cork> and that won't really work
[05:23:48] <dimaqq> where login() already sends the request and returns "deferred" and I assign a callback only later. so if ajax/xhmlhttprequest decided to hit me with an error right away, before my login() even returns, I'd be in trouble
[05:24:24] <Cork> dimaqq: what you should do is expose the defered add function
[05:24:37] <Cork> else your limiting what the deferred can do
[05:24:48] <dimaqq> I intend to :P
[05:24:59] <Cork> so myrpc.login().callback(function() {});
[05:25:02] <Cork> is a better syntax
[05:25:11] <heke80> Cork do not know what your code suppose to do but it does not return selected value of the radiobutton group
[05:25:12] <dimaqq> Cork: thanks for your input, I might end up doing that too...
[05:25:27] <Cork> that way you can do myrpc.login().callback(function() {}).callback(function() {}).callback(function() {}).callback(function() {}).callback(function() {});
[05:26:12] <heke80> Cork , radio buttons 'groubed by name'
[05:26:16] <Cork> heke80: it returnes an array of the values of all elements in your selector
[05:26:30] <dimaqq> coming back to my question, in the case of myrpc.login().callback(...); is there any chance that login will complete synchronousely (e.g. network down) and try to invoke my callback before it is set?
[05:26:40] <Cork> heke80: you might be looking for serialize though see ?serialize
[05:27:13] <heke80> Cork,  ok , needed selected value only of the  radiobutton group
[05:27:17] <Cork> dimaqq: 1. already answered that question, 2. deferred offers a way to handle that even if it could happen
[05:27:30] <dimaqq> kay thanks
[05:27:34] <heke80> cork checked value only...
[05:27:57] <Cork> bah bot-t's dead
[05:28:29] <dimaqq> btw I wasn't planning to use jQuery's deferred, rather hack something simple like it
[05:28:32] <Cork> dimaqq:  http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[05:28:38] <Cork> ops wron
[05:28:41] <Cork> heke80: ^
[05:29:02] <Cork> dimaqq: if your using jquery theres little need for that
[05:29:08] <Cork> use $.Callbacks
[05:29:09] <heke80> Cork , actually got it ... _selected_val = $('input[name="option['+ option.product_option_id +']"]:checked'   ).val();
[05:29:34] <Cork> dimaqq: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[05:29:50] <dimaqq> Cork: oh I didn't know about this one, looks very nice!
[05:30:10] <Cork> its basically deferred
[05:30:25] <Cork> rather deferred extends Callbacks
[05:30:40] <Cork> $.Callbacks was called $._Deferred before
[05:30:49] * dimaqq will study this some more...
[05:30:55] <Cork> and was used by $.Deferred internally
[05:31:53] <djh> I'm getting some HTML via $.ajax and inserting it into my document. The function that inserts the HTML then runs anolther function that should bind a click event to the newly-inserted HTML. However, it isn't working. Because it works fine when I put in a breakpoint and step through, I think the click binding is happening before the HTML has finished being inserted into the DOM. $(document).ready doesn't seem to help, what's the right way to delay the click bind
[05:32:37] <Cork> djh: document ready only works on page loads
[05:32:47] <Cork> ?p @ djh
[05:32:54] <djh> Cork: I thought it might be something like that..
[05:32:54] <Cork> grrr, bot-t~~
[05:33:12] <Cork> djh: pb your code in jsfiddle
[05:36:38] <djh> Cork: Not familiar with jsfiddle, would a link to the web page in question be more helpful? :)
[05:37:15] <Cork> djh: it would work ok, unless its a lot of code
[05:37:25] <djh> Cork: Nah, 'tis tiny: http://blog.yakshave.org/
[05:37:41] <djh> Cork: There's some JS being used to make the "Click to expand" work
[05:37:55] <Cork> djh: update your doctype to html5
[05:38:11] <djh> Cork: Now if you run display_post(2) in console, it'll switch to only displaying the second post, but the expand on click won't work
[05:38:11] <dimaqq> oh I think I get it now... are all javascriptn Events asynchronous by definition?
[05:38:13] <Cork> no need for that one mile long doctype :)
[05:38:27] <Cork> dimaqq: yes
[05:38:37] <djh> Cork: It was an auto-generated one, hadn't looked at it closely yet :)
[05:38:43] * dimaqq feels a little green... :P
[05:38:46] <dimaqq> Cork:  thanks
[05:39:11] <Cork> djh: wheres the code in question?
[05:39:56] <Cork> or to be more precise, wheres action?
[05:40:08] <Cork> ah, its a param
[05:40:11] <ruby_on_tails> hello
[05:40:15] <djh> Cork: stringblog.js, display_post gets the HTML and inserts it, then runs default_bindings which should add the onclick
[05:40:35] <djh> Cork: Yup, display_raw_post in this case
[05:40:48] <Cork> djh: why are you declaring global functions as expressions?
[05:41:04] <Cork> either use var or function name() {}
[05:41:12] <djh> Cork: Because I'm prototyping at the moment :)
[05:41:35] <Cork> thats not really an excuse to write dangerous code
[05:42:09] <Cork> your implicitly defining those variables with window.
[05:42:12] <djh> It's normally wrapped in an anonymous function, I've taken it out of there to make it easier to run from the console
[05:42:17] <Cork> ex. window.display_raw_post = function(data) { }
[05:42:45] <Cork> so either define the varialbe var display_raw_post = function(data) { }
[05:42:48] <Cork> or use statements
[05:43:09] <Cork> what your doing is REALLY error prown
[05:43:33] <djh> I'm actually generating JS via coffeescript, which handles the variable declarations itself - but to make it callable from the console, I've effectively broken that variable declarations a bit
[05:43:52] <Cork> djh: then use window.<var name>
[05:43:55] <ruby_on_tails> is coffeescript really good ?
[05:44:11] <Cork> that makes it explicit instead of implicit
[05:44:26] <djh> Cork: Fair enough. I'll update the JS to how it's generated if you like..?
[05:44:33] <Cork> no need
[05:44:48] <djh> ruby_on_tails: I'm just experimenting with it, I like some of what it does, certainly
[05:44:59] <ruby_on_tails> djh: hmm
[05:46:02] <djh> Cork: Are you able to replicate the problem with display_post(2) ?
[05:46:06] <Cork> djh: your first selecting for the html your about to add to the page
[05:46:14] <Cork> then your appending it
[05:46:35] <Cork> the new elements won't be in the page until after line 38
[05:46:46] <Cork> or if you mean the code in the last function
[05:46:49] <Cork> that won't work at all
[05:46:57] <Cork> as the call is async
[05:47:14] <Cork> so the display_post function will end before the success function is called
[05:47:25] <djh> Cork: Ahh.. so would putting the call to default_bindings into display_raw_post at the end work?
[05:48:05] <Cork> display_post > get_raw_post > ajax > get_raw_post(end) > display_post(end) > success > display_raw_post
[05:48:40] <Cork> or rather => display_post > get_raw_post > ajax > get_raw_post(end) > default_bindings => display_post(end) > success > display_raw_post
[05:49:34] <djh> Cork: Makes sense, I'd not factored in the async nature
[05:50:10] <Cork> everything that relays on ajax should always use deferred or callbacks of any other form
[05:50:32] <djh> Cork: I think callbacks make the most sense here
[05:50:39] <djh> Cork: Much obliged to you
[05:50:59] <Cork> display_post can work as you give a callback function from it to the ajax call
[05:51:03] <Cork> np
[05:53:34] <Cork> woops >_>
[05:53:42] <Cork> no irc huh?
[05:56:04] <Mikike> guys when come new jquery version?
[05:58:04] <Cork> Mikike: as far as i know jquery doens't have a fixed release schedule
[05:58:14] <Cork> they release a new version when its ready and working
[05:58:24] <Mikike> okey :)
[05:58:40] <Cork> http://bugs.jquery.com/milestone/1.8 is 75% done

[06:44:08] <macneib> Hi! I'm a jquery newbie and I'm stuck trying revise piece of code that was originally used in a .tmpl()  script. My qestion is probably easy to answer but how would I take something like <a href="#" onClick="logout(get_user($(this)))">Logout</a> and rewrite it so that it would work inside a jquery function.  Thanks in Advance
[06:44:52] <Brodingo> ?on @ macneib
[06:44:53] <bot-t> macneib, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:54:26] <Whirl3d> is there a jquery interface that operates for groups of elements rather than distributing to every member of a collection? In other words $("li").click(function () {   distributes the click event to every li element, whereas a $("li").all().click() could setup a listener on an element that was the lowest possible relative of all the li's to handle the click in one place...
[06:56:56] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: do you mean using event delegation?
[06:57:25] <johnkpaul> $("li").click(fn) _does_ add a click event for every li
[06:59:24] <Whirl3d> sure. But I would like to operate on groups of elements like $('li').parent().on("click", "li", function() ...
[06:59:48] <Whirl3d> or maybe just a "findCommonAncestor" method or something...
[07:00:26] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, perhaps you could explain the advantage and relative sexiness of using prototype inheritence...
[07:01:37] <Whirl3d> and perhaps you could clear up the different uses for var i= new objectFunction() {}   and var i=new ObjectFunction () { var el=this; return el;}....
[07:02:05] <Whirl3d> uggh.... brb
[07:03:25] <Nece228> is there any way on getting the json output without looping the data?
[07:04:55] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: sorry, I don't understand your question
[07:05:05] <johnkpaul> what do you mean "on groups of elements
[07:05:05] <johnkpaul> "
[07:05:33] <codeAssassin> Nece228: looping or iterating ?
[07:06:21] <Nece228> codeAssassin: i dont want to loop at all
[07:06:51] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/48250982
[07:06:53] <Nece228> thats the code
[07:06:58] <codeAssassin> Nece228: this depends on the dataset, but generally $.each(json, function(key,value) { //something }); works just fine
[07:07:37] <codeAssassin> Nece228: ahh, lets see here
[07:08:38] <codeAssassin> Nece228: why exactly don't you want to iterate through the dataset ?
[07:08:50] <johnkpaul> codeAssassin: I was wondering the same thing
[07:09:19] <johnkpaul> there is no way in javascript or otherwise to do what you want to do w/o touching each k/v pair, Nece228, you could make it recursion if you really wanted to
[07:10:08] <Nece228> iterate? how?
[07:10:34] <johnkpaul> $.each is iterating
[07:10:35] <codeAssassin> your $.each, thats how you iterate through the dataset
[07:10:40] <codeAssassin> "looping" as you were
[07:10:55] <johnkpaul> ah sorry, I didn't realize who used the term iterating
[07:11:04] <Nece228> ok so what do you suggest?
[07:11:12] <johnkpaul> Nece228: does it work now?
[07:11:37] <codeAssassin> How would you touch each item without going through each key/value paur, and why would you want to do it any different?
[07:11:42] <codeAssassin> *pair
[07:12:20] <codeAssassin> If something isn't broken, don't fix it
[07:12:59] <Nece228> well it would work if not this + $('productquantity').val() * $('productprice').val()
[07:13:03] <johnkpaul> codeAssassin: there is no way to accomplish that, you have to touch each item
[07:13:19] <codeAssassin> johnkpaul: exactly my point
[07:13:47] <Nece228> because i push those values and right after i want to do something to them
[07:14:18] <codeAssassin> what do you want to do to them ?
[07:14:50] <codeAssassin> Because, you can append empty items. Let me see here
[07:16:08] <sunbeam> how can i best center (on a full width page) a position: absolute; div thats 1000px width
[07:19:16] <codeAssassin> Nece228: for the record: im working on ur prob
[07:19:27] <Brodingo> sunbeam left: 50%; margin-left: -500px;
[07:20:25] <Nece228> codeAssassin: you see product sum should just multiply whats outputed in productquantity and productprice
[07:20:39] <Nece228> and after that productsum div should be live
[07:21:18] <Nece228> i mean if i change something on productprice or productquantity productsum should automatically change
[07:22:29] <codeAssassin> Nece228: http://jsfiddle.net/pNDkH/
[07:23:24] <Goopyo> is there a good way load while preserving urls?
[07:24:00] <Goopyo> i.e I have 2 pages /account/login and account/register where the only difference is the center div. How would pretty load the center div (I know about .load()) and get the url to change?
[07:26:00] <Nece228> codeAssassin: thanks ill try to understand what you wrote :D
[07:29:59] <codeAssassin> Nece228: np man, it's not that hard. so i think you're going to be ok ;)

[08:09:22] <engaged> How can I update a div with attribute invoiceID="137" ?
[08:09:42] <engaged> i want to do like $(".thisDiv").attr("invoiceID"=137).html("myhtml")
[08:09:47] <engaged> but obviously that isn't right
[08:10:02] <ENQ> is it data-attribute?
[08:10:45] <ENQ> you need to use filter or more specific selector
[08:10:52] <engaged> <span class="thisDiv" invoiceID="137">blah</span>
[08:11:00] <ENQ> its not allowed
[08:11:12] <jeffsmykil> Does a UI Widget automatically hit _setOption the first time it runs?
[08:11:14] <ENQ> you must use data-invoiceID
[08:11:15] <MrTool> you had to put a data- in front of the invoice
[08:11:56] <engaged> example?
[08:12:00] <ENQ> then use like $(".thisDiv [data-invoiceID=137]") or msth like that
[08:12:09] <MrTool> than you can access the element by $('.thisDiv[data-invoiceID="137"]')
[08:12:12] <ENQ> <span class="thisDiv" data-invoiceID="137">blah</span>
[08:12:16] <engaged> if i do $(".thisDiv").attr("invoiceID") i get 137
[08:12:47] <ENQ> no you do $().html("html to set")
[08:13:01] <ENQ> just put selector MrTool gave
[08:13:08] <engaged> k
[08:13:09] <engaged> anotehr question
[08:14:11] <engaged> i do $(".thisDiv").click(function() {   $.ajax({ url 'blah.php', success: function(msg) { $(this).html('blah') } }); });
[08:14:21] <engaged> how come its not recognizing $(this) in the ajax call
[08:14:30] <engaged> before the ajax call $(this) works fine
[08:14:43] <engaged> thats why im having to use the invoiceID attribute
[08:15:10] <MrTool> bevore ajax call create something like    var myEle = this;
[08:15:11] <ENQ> could you share the code?
[08:15:22] <MrTool> and in the function use  $(myEle).html
[08:15:30] <engaged> ok thanks MrTool
[08:15:37] <faraway> hi, could someone tell me why when i load a script with getScript, a function that i add to the prototype of Object is called ? http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/b8yr2/ (does not matter what script i'm loading)
[08:16:53] <faraway> or to be more precise, every function i add to the prototype is called (chrome, safari firefox)
[08:18:35] <MrTool> @faraway, what exactly do you wanna do
[08:20:16] <faraway> MrTool: extending all object with a forEach function to hat fixes to toString, valueOf bug in IE and auto uses the hasOwnProperty, it would be no problem, do it without adding it to the prototype of the Object, but i'm wondering why the functions are called ;)
[08:20:31] <scratcha> ahh cracking up guys! When i use the following:  $(btnSel + ' .btn-gold').fadeOut();   ,,,, the dom element fades out exactly as expected. WHen i change the .fadeOut to .click() ,,,, nothing fires. any ideas anyone ?
[08:21:37] <MrTool> ok sry but i can't help you
[08:22:02] <knightG> Hi all
[08:22:24] <MrTool> @scratcha: maybe do you mean $(btnSel + ' .btn-gold').trigger('click'); ???
[08:22:32] <faraway> MrTool: ah ok .. now i see what the problem is â¦ jquery does not seem to take care of hasOwnProperty
[08:23:13] <faraway> is a query maintainer around ?
[08:24:44] <knightG> I've following problem. I am using CakePHP and jquery. When a page is loaded I want to execute certain ajax/json call. Problem is that cakePHP sets some request attributes like "Cookie" and "Referer". It seems that I cannot set/reset or remove these attributes. Is there a way for jquery to simply ignore these headers ?
[08:25:38] <knightG> Here is some code ...
[08:25:55] <knightG>     $.ajaxSetup({
[08:25:57] <knightG>         async: false,
[08:25:58] <knightG>         cache: false
[08:26:00] <knightG>      });
[08:26:01] <knightG>      
[08:26:03] <knightG>     $.getJSON(url, null, function(data) {
[08:26:04] <knightG>        $.each(data, function(i,row) {
[08:26:06] <knightG>           var date=row[0];
[08:26:07] <knightG>           var price=parseFloat(row[1]);
[08:26:09] <knightG>           r.push([date, price]);
[08:26:10] <knightG>        });
[08:26:12] <knightG>     });
[08:26:20] <knightG> even if URL is set to www.google.com it still attaches Cookie and Referer
[08:26:22] <faraway> anyway â¦ found a bug report about this, and an explantion
[08:29:23] <Whirl3d> KnightG, please don't post code in the channel. If you want to share some code, go to jsfiddle.net and set up a fiddle. It's a great way to ask for help. Then you just share the url in the channel.
[08:29:29] <sunbeam> does anyone know if it's possible to get the background image of html{} 100px from the center of the page?
[08:29:30] <scratcha> MrTool: .trigger('click'); sounds like what i want to do, but its not doing anything,, apparnetly
[08:31:28] <knightG> ok, the code is here http://jsfiddle.net/cgZpq/
[08:33:00] <jonathancutrell> gday folks.
[08:36:40] <Whirl3d> knightG, what's the issue?
[08:37:36] <knightG> issue is that jquery Ajax call attaches some HTTP header attributes. I would like it to send GET request without any attributes
[08:38:26] <knightG> for instance. I am using CakePHP. When page is loaded CakePHP sets some attributes somewhere : Cookie and Referer
[08:38:50] <knightG> I want these attributes gone as they create a mess when I issue Ajax/json call
[08:40:00] <Whirl3d> so isn't that a CakePHP issue?
[08:40:29] <silverwind> CakePHP is the issue :D
[08:40:36] <silverwind> Using PHP is another :D
[08:41:13] <Whirl3d> Unfortunately, I don't know anything about the actual content sent with $.ajax or $.getJSON....I use them, just don't have any idea what is actually being sent.
[08:42:14] <knightG> well CakePHP only displays a page. I execute some jQuery on that page. Problem is that these attributes are set by cakePHP. This is ok as long as you navigate within this domain. But what good is SessionID if I execute AJAX call to www.google.com ?
[08:42:45] <Whirl3d> why does it matter?
[08:43:01] <Whirl3d> I guess I am not understanding what you are trying to do
[08:45:25] <knightG> The call that AJAX makes is something like:
[08:45:30] <knightG> GET
[08:45:34] <knightG> host: google.com
[08:45:42] <knightG> Session: XYZ
[08:45:55] <knightG> and google reponds with 500 (internal srv error)
[08:46:04] <knightG> if however I'd supply only
[08:46:06] <knightG> GET
[08:46:09] <knightG> host: google.com
[08:46:26] <knightG> without session attribute It'd work
[08:46:35] <rno> Hi guys,
[08:46:37] <Whirl3d> did you try using $.get()
[08:46:51] <laszlof> are you expecting sessions to pass across multiple domains?
[08:46:56] <laszlof> because they dont work that way
[08:47:08] <rno> do you the kind of function used for http://www.housetrip.com/ if you click on the flag on the right, to display the DIV
[08:47:25] <rno> it's very clean and elegant
[08:47:48] <rno> s/do you/do you know/
[08:48:26] <Whirl3d> rno, are you talking about the language selector?
[08:48:33] <rno> Whirl3d: yep
[08:48:50] <Whirl3d> i am pretty sure it's .click
[08:49:18] <rno> when I tried, by DIV move everything down :(
[08:50:05] <Whirl3d> fixed position your div
[08:50:19] <knightG> Whirl3d: yes. Same problem
[08:50:25] <henn1nk> i would like to use hide() and show() ... but how do i do this with many layers? click on image 1 layer 1 is shown, click on image 6 layer 6 is shown?
[08:50:40] <Whirl3d> did you read what laszlof said?
[08:51:32] <MadLems> is there a simple jquery function i can try calling to confirm jQuery is loaded on a page properly?  like $(document).test() or something
[08:51:41] <Whirl3d> henn1nk, can you go to jsfiddle.net and setup the html for your situation and share the link here. It's easy to do what you want, I suspect, but seeing your html would help.
[08:52:14] <laszlof> MadLems: if (typeof jQuery != 'undefined') maybe
[08:52:41] <MadLems> perfect, thanks
[08:52:52] <Whirl3d> $().jQuery works as well.
[08:53:12] <henn1nk> Whirl3d: ok thanks
[08:54:50] <dp> does jquery remove url fragments when sending XHR requests?
[08:55:17] <henn1nk> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/h8XMQ/ something like this
[08:55:20] <rno> Whirl3d: Not sure why I did not think about the fixed position first
[08:55:30] <henn1nk> Whirl3d: only 1 layer should be displayed
[08:55:53] <Whirl3d> henn1nk, I'll brb
[08:56:39] <knightG> is AJAX intended to work across domains anyhow ?
[08:57:03] <silverwind> Nope... unless you use CORS
[08:57:12] <silverwind> Which must be enabled server-side
[08:57:25] <laszlof> its easier to proxy the requests through a local script
[08:57:31] <laszlof> (in most cases)
[08:57:35] <silverwind> True.
[08:57:37] <MadLems> do i have to do something special if my selector is a variable?  That is, are these identical or not:  $("#foo")  and  var foo = "#foo"; $(foo) ?
[08:57:39] <silverwind> And more compatible.
[08:58:02] <laszlof> MadLems: $('#'+someid)
[08:58:08] <laszlof> var someid = 'foo';
[08:58:19] <laszlof> that'd be the same as $('#foo')
[08:59:00] <laszlof> I dont think what you stated would work. $(foo) would just turn the string into an jQuery object
[08:59:09] <laszlof> (I think()
[09:02:33] <silverwind> MadLems, there's nothing special to do if the string inside the variable is a valid selector
[09:04:04] <MadLems> silverwind: thanks... starting to lose my mind over here.. :P
[09:04:06] <sacho> seems like a fundamental misunderstanding of variables and constants
[09:04:20] <sacho> or well, literals.
[09:04:35] <laszlof> yup. I was incorrect. it does work as you mentioned MadLems
[09:05:44] <v_y> how can i get the offset of the view of the page? (i want to determine using $(element).offset() whether an element is visible
[09:06:17] <sacho> page*, scroll*
[09:07:15] <sacho> so scroll* in your case.
[09:07:37] <v_y> so it's scroll<something>?
[09:09:09] <nail_> jQuery Mobile - Would anyone know why the select element doesn't get its options added when the page gets refreshed by submitting the form? http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10644230/jqm/meta.html
[09:09:16] <knightG> Whirl3d: FYI. get() solved the problem
[09:09:20] <knightG> thankx
[09:09:34] <nail_> The pageinit handler gets called everytime, but for some reason the <option>s are added then they are like swiped
[09:09:43] <nail_> or the <select> element gets reset for some reason
[09:11:07] <nail_> is it something like the "new" #sel clashing with the old one?
[09:15:00] <v0lksman> hello all!  I am doing a $.post() on a form, if the form validates (server side) then the response is to redirect the client, if the form is invalid however the response is to replace an element with the form errors.  How can you test this in the success function?
[09:15:42] <v0lksman> by test this I mean test if the response is a redirection or not...is there a way to look at the headers being returned?
[09:15:50] <MadLems> what's the simplest way to fetch the output on a php file with jQuery and save it as a variable? (to set something's innerHTML as)
[09:16:42] <fRAiLtY-> guys, when I hover the main image there's a zoom which is meant to be on-top, but it's behind the image, why? http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing
[09:16:54] <fRAiLtY-> I've given it z-index:2 so it should be on-top
[09:16:57] <fRAiLtY-> But it's not
[09:19:15] <silverwind> MadLems, If it's HTML, then probably the .load function
[09:19:42] <johnkpaul> v0lksman: that's a really godo question, I'm actually looking into it now
[09:19:50] <johnkpaul> becuase I'd love to know, I haven't come across the case mysefl
[09:20:21] <MadLems> silverwind: .load looks perfect. thanks
[09:22:01] <johnkpaul> v0lksman: I don't think that you can, XHR doesn't give you that ability
[09:22:11] <johnkpaul> and jQuery, built on top of XHR, can't have it either
[09:22:25] <v0lksman> johnkpaul: found this on .ajax()  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/199099/how-to-manage-a-redirect-request-after-a-jquery-ajax-call
[09:22:55] <johnkpaul> v0lksman: that's not using 3* status code
[09:23:02] <johnkpaul> so it's not really redirecting
[09:23:02] <v0lksman> but I think the easiest way is to modify my response to either a URL or data.  If URL then redirect, if data replaceWith
[09:23:10] <nail_> Mmmh indeed, it seems to act on the *old* #sel, I added a console.log and when you submit it shows "foofoo' http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10644230/jqm/meta.html - So would anyone know how to work on the new #sel that is returned? (or where to place the code so it does so)
[09:23:16] <johnkpaul> well, v0lksman, if it's an error, why not send an error status code
[09:23:20] <johnkpaul> and the error details as the body
[09:23:50] <v0lksman> johnkpaul: possibly...it's an HTML response though
[09:24:11] <johnkpaul> that's ok, just set your response content type appropriatley
[09:24:39] <v0lksman> hrm...will try!  thanks!
[09:26:47] <johnkpaul> no problem, v0lksman
[09:32:42] <Whirl3d> how do you get the closest common relative? in other words, given ca collection of elements in various heirarchies in the dom, how do I determine the most common shared element?
[09:33:23] <henn1nk> Whirl3d: ?:)
[09:33:50] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: http://goursaha.freeoda.com/DataStructure/LowestCommonAncestor.html
[09:34:05] <johnkpaul> that's for a binary tree, but the algorithm should be easily generalized
[09:34:17] <johnkpaul> not really a jquery thing, and I'm sure that there's no jquery method for it
[09:34:23] <Whirl3d> henn1nk, sorry. Here is the fiddle i started to setup. you'll need to fix the css cause I messed it up somehow
[09:34:24] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/h8XMQ/17/
[09:35:29] <henn1nk> Whirl3d: i try thanks
[09:35:41] <Whirl3d> yeah, johnkpaul, thanks for the link and I'll try to figure out wtf is going on there, but It looks completely foreight to me
[09:36:25] <johnkpaul> yeah, sorry Whirl3d, I couldn't find an example in javascript
[09:36:44] <johnkpaul> that's C++ I believe
[09:37:00] <Whirl3d> henn1nk, you basically need a way to relate the links to the divs...so i used the div id's and the anchor href attributes. You can use anything you want so long as you can say "select the div that matches me and hide others, show that div" inside the click handler for the buttons...
[09:37:49] <henn1nk> Whirl3d: how can i do this with a radio button? :>
[09:38:04] <Whirl3d> see, that's why I asked about your html. LOL
[09:38:24] <Whirl3d> can you modify the fiddle's html to put the radio button where you want it.
[09:38:32] <Whirl3d> then update and share the url here
[09:38:49] <henn1nk> Whirl3d: can i use data-foo attribute too?
[09:38:57] <Whirl3d> anything you want
[09:39:13] <fission6> how do i select all elements that have a title text?
[09:39:18] <fission6> er title attribute
[09:39:27] <Whirl3d> so long as there is a definite way to identify/select the div that you want from the button that you are managing.
[09:39:43] <Whirl3d> $("[title]")
[09:41:41] <Epik`> Good morning everyone :)
[09:42:35] <Epik`> Anyone available to help out on a quick question?
[09:44:07] <Whirl3d> ? as
[09:44:10] <Whirl3d> ?askk
[09:44:20] <Whirl3d> my k button is bro en LOL
[09:45:13] <Epik`> http://pastebin.com/HYsBwGAc -> Just wondering how i can find the text within .category when clicking on the floorplan_image li
[09:45:37] <Epik`> i tried different assortments of .parent and .prev but cant seem to get the syntax correct
[09:45:39] <FrozenFire> Anyone know why I might be getting "Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'overlay'" when calling jQuery Tools' overlay plugin? I'm loading the CDN version with jQuery and all tools.
[09:46:09] <FrozenFire> The call is being made in the ready event handler
[09:46:14] <Epik`> FrozenFire, You may be loading jQuery twice.
[09:46:23] <Epik`> the CDN has jquery built in
[09:46:40] <Whirl3d> epik to start, there is no .foorplan_image li   there's an li .floorplan_image, however
[09:46:57] <Whirl3d> but you porbably want .closest
[09:47:08] <FrozenFire> Epik`, You may be right. I just looked at it, and I think something in my framework is loading its own version of jQuery
[09:47:17] <Whirl3d> $("li .floorpan_image").closest(".category").text();
[09:47:25] <Whirl3d> sorry
[09:48:04] <Epik`> Ok ill try that out, one sec
[09:48:20] <Whirl3d> $("li floorplan_image").closest(".img_list").find("a.category").text();
[09:48:25] <Whirl3d> should maybe do it.
[09:49:14] <henn1nk> Whirl3d: https://gist.github.com/2937520 ... the layers are: id=basic_article_1 class=basic_article_div ; id=basic_article_2 class=basic_article_div
[09:49:16] <Epik`> Still no results :\
[09:49:22] <Epik`> just blank.
[09:49:27] <Whirl3d> I thought your .category element wrapped around the floorpan_image...but it doesn't so the second one should hopefully work. Of course if you had pasted the same code in jsfiddle we could test it.
[09:49:51] <Epik`> let me paste it in jsfiddle :)
[09:50:23] <henn1nk> Whirl3d: all layers are hidden after click, but no one is shown
[09:51:10] <Whirl3d> henn1nk, sorry. I don't have time to visualize your code when there is a clear tool to test it. Maybe someone else can help you
[09:51:36] <Whirl3d> maybe you pasted the wrong url
[09:51:47] <Whirl3d> because I don't see how they are related at all.
[09:52:08] <henn1nk> Whirl3d: oh wait
[09:52:25] <Epik`> http://jsfiddle.net/uzX7C/
[09:53:07] <Whirl3d> Epik' so, click on Option80a and you want the console to log out "main floor", right?
[09:53:23] <Epik`> Thats correct
[09:53:43] <Epik`> This list also repeats as seen here, not sure if that will effect the direction needed for search
[09:53:51] <Epik`> probably why i was assuming i need a prev()
[09:54:26] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/uzX7C/1/
[09:55:19] <henn1nk> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/rQPJS/
[09:56:17] <Epik`> Prefect, thank  you! was much simpler than i was trying to write haha
[09:58:22] <henn1nk> Whirl3d: sorry :) ... but now an idea?
[09:58:39] <jeffsmykil> I need to write a function that will look inside a table cell and return true or false based on whether it has content other than spaces
[09:59:29] <David_Bradbury> Say I have a div with a background-color set in the CSS. I then change the color to blue using jQuery. How do I remove the inline style to restore it back? (Without assigning the color since the CSS might change)
[09:59:35] <jeffsmykil> anythoughts?
[09:59:55] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: go for it!
[10:00:05] <jeffsmykil> lol any thoughts on a strategy?
[10:00:08] <David_Bradbury> Look in each cell's $().html and compare it?
[10:00:15] <jeffsmykil> am I going to have to use a regular exoressib>
[10:00:18] <jeffsmykil> expression
[10:00:20] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: yes you are
[10:00:22] <jeffsmykil> ok
[10:00:23] <Whirl3d> henn1nk, you are close... the thing is that you want $(this).val() instead of $(this).attr('id');
[10:00:37] <Whirl3d> and you need "#" in front of your id selector
[10:00:41] <jeffsmykil> NoiseEee: thank you
[10:01:03] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: np good luck
[10:01:07] <Whirl3d> var div=$("#switch_"+$(this).val());
[10:01:12] <henn1nk> oh
[10:01:15] <jeffsmykil> NoiseEee: this is all because of IE 7
[10:01:16] <jeffsmykil> UGH
[10:01:49] <David_Bradbury> You could also do a check to see if it has any spaces. If it doesn't have spaces and isn't "", then it has non-space characters
[10:02:09] <henn1nk> Whirl3d: doesn't work :( http://jsfiddle.net/rQPJS/6/
[10:02:15] <jeffsmykil> I think Im going to do a replace with spaces
[10:02:29] <henn1nk> Whirl3d: ah ops wait :D
[10:03:10] <henn1nk> Whirl3d: works thanks :)
[10:04:08] <henn1nk> Whirl3d: BUT the radio button doesn't change now.
[10:04:25] <Whirl3d> remove the prevent default
[10:04:26] <David_Bradbury> I figured out the answer to my question. You can remove a style set by jQuery by assigning that style to "". (For example, $(#blah).css("background-color", "");
[10:05:59] <Whirl3d> jeffsmykil, you could try $("td:contains(/^ /)"); or something close...
[10:06:51] <henn1nk> Whirl3d: thanks so much!
[10:06:54] <dekna> hi there. if i have some var handle = $('selector); how can i subselect inside this? handle.children('selector'); won't work(i think cause its no direct children).
[10:07:11] <Whirl3d> henn1nk, np
[10:07:26] <zoster> will document ready be triggered
[10:07:27] <Whirl3d> dekna, try .find()
[10:07:32] <fission6> anyone have a tooltip plugin rec
[10:07:33] <zoster> only when all the data is loaded?
[10:07:43] <Whirl3d> $("selector").find(".subclass")
[10:07:59] <dekna> ah cool thx
[10:08:02] <zoster> fission6 - twitter's bootstrap FTW
[10:08:20] <zoster> check it out at: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap
[10:08:41] <fission6> zoster: yeah i am trying to use that but the issue is i am using bootstrap 1.4
[10:08:50] <zoster> try with 2.0.4
[10:08:54] <zoster> it has enhancements
[10:09:07] <fission6> yeah but the site is alreayd designed on boostrap css from 1.4
[10:09:30] <zoster> you can easily write your own tooltip
[10:09:45] <zoster> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/build-a-better-tooltip-with-jquery-awesomeness/
[10:10:04] <fission6> well i have twipsy working the tooltip for bootstrap 1.4 but it wont fade out
[10:10:07] <fission6> it shows
[10:11:02] <dp> does jquery remove url fragments when sending XHR requests?
[10:11:24] <zoster> you mean ? and & from url?
[10:11:25] <fission6> yea its weird - the tooltip shows nicely but wont hide
[10:11:41] <dp> zoster: no; things after #
[10:12:00] <zoster> I think not
[10:12:02] <zoster> because you can
[10:12:15] <zoster> $('.div').load('some.html#fragment');
[10:12:30] <dp> one second
[10:12:51] <psyolus> Is it just me, or does Mobile Safari not handle CORS properly?
[10:13:25] <zoster> dp: or like this: $('#result').load('ajax/test.html #container'); (from: http://api.jquery.com/load/)
[10:13:44] <dp> http://jsfiddle.net/NAm2m/
[10:13:46] <zoster> psyolus: what are CORS?
[10:13:59] <psyolus> zoster: cross-origin resource sharing
[10:14:16] <dp> if you debug it, it's doing something with everything *up to* the fragment
[10:14:31] <psyolus> I know Firefox screws it up.
[10:14:39] <psyolus> Safari and Google Chrome handle it properly.
[10:15:04] <psyolus> Mobile Safari is doing something weird. I can't debug it properly as I don't have the iOS 6 preview.
[10:15:05] <dp> and if you look at the network traffic, the request is made without the fragment
[10:15:29] <zoster> yes, I see
[10:15:50] <zoster> why don't you try with $.ajax()
[10:15:59] <zoster> and set type: 'javascript'
[10:16:15] <zoster> script, whatever :)
[10:16:53] <dp> zoster: http://jsfiddle.net/NAm2m/2/
[10:16:55] <zoster> dataType is the setting key
[10:16:55] <dp> same result
[10:17:52] <saschagehlich> hey, I'm trying to listen for the scroll event of a <ul> which has overflow-y: auto
[10:17:58] <zoster> well
[10:18:03] <saschagehlich> scrolling works fine, but it seems like the scroll event is never emitted
[10:18:07] <zoster> is it possible to do cross-domain ajax-requests at all?
[10:18:18] <saschagehlich> what could be possible reasons for that?
[10:18:46] <dp> I was under the impression that $.getScript would just add that to the head and whatnot
[10:20:03] <zoster> send me the jsfiddle previous script where you use getScript please
[10:20:22] <dp> http://jsfiddle.net/NAm2m/
[10:20:52] <dp> I can see that it doesn't, but I thought that it did
[10:24:53] <zoster> do not know...
[10:25:08] <zoster> well write a custom script importer
[10:25:53] <zoster> $('head').append( $(document.createElement('script')).attr({src:YOUR_URL, type:"text/javascript",async:false}) );
[10:29:01] <SuperPhly> is there anyone here who can help me diagnose some .htaccess issues? I've got some odd behavior that isn't making a lot of sense to me.
[10:29:14] <SuperPhly> ooops, wrong chan
[10:29:23] <dp> zoster: I can do http://jsfiddle.net/NAm2m/3/ which works perfectly
[10:29:56] <zoster> you don't have # fragments in that URL
[10:30:13] <zoster> maybe something in the URL validator in jQuery core
[10:30:26] <zoster> witch removes all after-fragments of the URL
[10:30:27] <dp> understood; http://jsfiddle.net/NAm2m/4/
[10:30:35] <dp> that one works as well, with a fragment
[10:31:22] <dp> the only thing I can really see in debugging the url I need is that the request is made without a method. the last jsfiddle has one
[10:31:37] <zoster> data is undefined / d variable in your case
[10:32:03] <dp> eh?
[10:34:05] <dp> I'm not sure it's a fragment issue anyway. trying to load just the base URL causes the same issue
[10:34:13] <dp> time to fire up wireshark
[10:34:25] <zoster> :D
[10:42:03] <ahwan> hello friends .. I am from India ..male..age 17 .. I want an online part time job ..no matter in India or outside and quality ....will any1 help me?
[10:42:59] <Zzaichik> I hear McDonald's is hiring
[10:43:10] <dp> zoster: adblock. adblock killed the request immediately\
[10:44:13] <WebDragon> how's jquery at the sort of media-queries css can do regarding screen width and the like to tell whether or not to fire off a particular script if one's media is wide enough for desktop and so we should enable that horizontal slider... ?
[10:47:47] <Zzaichik> you should reword that
[10:48:09] <Zzaichik> you're asking about tracking $(window).width type of stuff?
[10:49:23] <WebDragon> kindasorta
[10:49:55] <WebDragon> in a way, I'm thinking there may be some instances where I do NOT want a horizontal slider to fire off, in a mobile design, but instead those boxes will be vertical
[10:50:10] <WebDragon> so knowing when NOT to shoot off the js, is also important
[10:50:21] <WebDragon> let alone some mobile devices that just can't
[10:50:59] <Zzaichik> so you want to set a conditional to prevent a script from firing if a certain device or browser is used.
[10:51:26] <Surrealis> wouldn't modernizer do that better?
[10:51:53] <WebDragon> only if the media-query reports the device-width to be too small for the script to be useful (which MEANS the css is also affecting the design to be more vertically oriented as well)
[10:52:19] <WebDragon> Surrealis: _possibly_ .. i hadn't considered that (and should have)
[10:52:28] <WebDragon> I'll look into that. thanks for the reminder
[10:52:35] <Zzaichik> ^ yeah that's a good idea.
[10:52:41] <WebDragon> cheers mates :)

[10:56:32] <LSshocke> can someone tell me how i can use my array example: http://jsfiddle.net/d5T9N/1/ and use each of the items inside to create the cover and info, so like an each() thing but going through an array
[10:57:18] <zamba> i want to be able to click on a link on a page and get a login prompt on another part of the page (no popup).. what can i use for that?
[10:58:45] <zamba> and another question.. when i click on a tr i have a selector that will make a class visible and another hidden.. but the problem is that it makes all rows alternative view visible, but i'm only interested in the current (this) row
[10:59:19] <zamba> i have $('.edit_tr').click(...
[11:00:06] <zamba> and then the code to make toggle visibility is: $('.edit_tr .editbox').show(); $('.edit_tr .text').hide();
[11:01:44] <cluelesscoder> anyone up for helping me understand why my .click event handler is not firing when I click on this button? http://www.badcapitalist.com/list.html - the function is inside the only $(document).ready function
[11:02:19] <cluelesscoder> it's connected to the delete class which is also being added through a function, so I think that might be screwing it up...
[11:05:08] <v_y> is there a way to test whether an element is still in the dom?
[11:05:33] <Surrealis> I have a horrificlly long running script, 1000's of items being checked. I have tried slicing  but it still gives the long running script issue.
[11:06:01] <Surrealis> yes it is a "long running script" but is there a way to break it up so that the browser knows that it is working correctly?
[11:12:49] <KorvinSzanto> How can I remove an element from a list of matched elements
[11:13:02] <KorvinSzanto> I'm trying to remove every $('.match') other than the last one

[11:14:00] <KorvinSzanto> http://jsfiddle.net/Fpjnt/
[11:14:35] <NoiseEee> Surrealis: break it up into hundreds at a time or something. but obviously 1000s of items on a page has a certain UI failure reek about it
[11:15:00] <sunbeam> does anyone know if it's possible to get the background image of html{} 100px from the center of the page?
[11:16:02] <KorvinSzanto> it is sunbeam, measure the page document width then adjust the background-position accordingly

[11:17:27] <ibash> i.e. doing this
[11:17:43] <ibash> $('form').data('submit-btn', submit-btn)
[11:17:53] <jeffsmykil> I have a bug where when search is caching in IE despite cache being set to false
[11:18:05] <ibash> later I want to do $('form').data('submit-btn', '')
[11:18:18] <ibash> or should I do delete $('form').data('submit-btn')
[11:18:20] <ibash> ?
[11:18:55] <rnewson> I have a function (https://friendpaste.com/2VdGw1BECOVPIRlE3sQTZS) where I'd like to exclude items without the 'unmapped' class at line 2, but can't figure out the syntax. $('#navbar li:not(.unmapped)') is what I'm trying, but isn't right.

[11:29:56] <garbagegod> ?
[11:30:40] <johnkpaul> garbagegod: look into jquery bbq
[11:32:05] <sunbeam> David_Bradbury: i added that amount of pixels transparent to the left of the actual old image

[11:35:17] <MrGando> is there a way to append an id to a div element using jquery ? I want to 'mark' a div as modified by appending an id ( or there's a better way ? )
[11:35:59] <johnkpaul> MrGando: look into jQuery.data, you can associate any arbitrary obj with a dom element
[11:36:18] <johnkpaul> garbagegod: that's the quickest and dirtiest, it's just a bit of copying and pasting
[11:36:59] <MrGando> johnkpaul could you give me a small example of how would you use jquery.data to achieve this ? It's not very clear for me ( I'm quite new to jquery )
[11:39:19] <johnkpaul> $.data(el, "name","value")
[11:39:27] <johnkpaul> MrGando: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[11:41:35] <cluelesscoder> anyone have any hints on how I can get this .click to work at http://www.badcapitalist.com/list.html? I've tried reworking it using .bind, and still no go
[11:42:13] <johnkpaul> cluelesscoder: "click" not "onclick"
[11:42:51] <cluelesscoder> johnkpaul: thanks... still not firing
[11:42:51] <johnkpaul> also, you add your event handlers before the elements are on the page
[11:43:07] <johnkpaul> you need to add the handler after the elements are in the dom
[11:43:21] <johnkpaul> ?on @cluelesscoder
[11:43:21] <caniuse> johnkpaul: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:43:31] <johnkpaul> use that to delegate from your container
[11:43:45] <johnkpaul> cluelesscoder: www.elijahmanor.com/2012/02/differences-between-jquery-bind-vs-live.html will explain how
[11:43:48] <cluelesscoder> johnkpaul: I thought since they were in the .ready they were being aded after?
[11:43:49] <raj> if the current url is www.hello.com/thing1/thing2 ...how can I get ahold of thing1?
[11:44:03] <raj> i have History.js, but not sure if it's the right tool
[11:44:12] <cluelesscoder> johnkpaul: ah thanks I'll take a look
[11:44:31] <raj> oh, nice
[11:44:32] <raj> it is
[11:44:35] <raj> .getState()
[11:45:19] <cluelesscoder> ?on
[11:45:19] <caniuse> cluelesscoder: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:45:55] <MrGando> johnkpaul I this, but didn't work out :( jQuery.data($('#referrals_index-header'), 'id', 'modified');
[11:46:26] <NoiseEee> MrGando: $('#yourDivID').data('modified',true);
[11:47:35] <MrGando> NoiseEee that will append by default ? :)
[11:47:42] <NoiseEee> append?
[11:48:22] <NoiseEee> no, that will make the element contain data, the key 'modified' with the value true
[11:49:12] <NoiseEee> johnkpaul told you to store information about the element (ie: whether its been modified) as data on the element, and to not change and element's ID to reflect some new type of data
[11:50:14] <MrGando> NoiseEee Oh, now I understand. Still I tried your code and I don't see data="modified" in my div :(
[11:50:39] <NoiseEee> you won't
[11:50:54] <sunbeam> is there a way i can have each even digit <p> </p> inside a certain div a margin: 0 0 0 50px ; ? do i need js for this?
[11:50:59] <NoiseEee> but if you ask via jquery whether or not there is data on the div with a key of modified, it will tell you the value
[11:51:19] <MrGando> NoiseEee thanks , will try it out :)
[11:52:14] <MrGando> NoiseEee I should do that like $('#element_id').data('modified') == true ?
[11:52:44] <NoiseEee> MrGando: $('#yourDivID').data('modified',true);
[11:52:59] <NoiseEee> (02:39:17 PM) johnkpaul: MrGando: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[11:53:37] <MrGando> NoiseEee yeah, I understand that :) , my point was about checking via jQuery if the 'modified' key is there or not
[11:55:22] <NoiseEee> MrGando: you'd check against 'undefined'
[11:55:47] <rhelic> Are there any interesting file uploades in jQuery, I found a basic one, looking it see if there was something fancier
[11:56:01] <MrGando> NoiseEee oh, like $('#element_id').data('modified') == 'undefined' ?
[11:56:24] <NoiseEee> tias!
[11:57:09] <rhelic> I need something that falls back in IE, so it still works, the HTML5/jQ ones I've seen, don't support IE at all
[11:57:12] <NoiseEee> (hint undefined!='undefined')
[11:57:55] <silverwind> rhelic, file upload is a mess on everything but very recent browsers... you could use XHR2 + FileAPI on new browsers.. and fallback to iframe for IE and old browsers
[11:58:08] <MrGando> NoiseEee hahaha ok, so just == undefined
[11:58:44] <NoiseEee> MrGando: yes, but for me i always prefer typeof <whatevs> == 'undefined'
[11:59:06] <rhelic> silverwind: hmm, thanks for the idea, probably more involved that I want to get but I'll check out their demo
[11:59:31] <silverwind> rhelic, if you check the jquery file-upload plugin... you'll see that it's exactly what it does.
[11:59:51] <MrGando> NoiseEee I think I understand, let me try this out
[12:00:06] <silverwind> rhelic, unfortunately, I found that plugin to be a big and unflexible steaming pile of shit
[12:00:53] <rhelic> lol, I tried another drop demo, and instead of saying "hey this doesn't work in IE" it just caused my image to be viewed in IE, lol
[12:01:04] <rhelic> hey I hate IE as much as the next guy, but at least ERROR or do something
[12:02:16] <MrGando> NoiseEee thank you , I will read the data docs in depth now :)
[12:02:17] <NoiseEee> rhelic: completely different issue than file upload over xhr
[12:02:29] <silverwind> Another problem is that even if you get it working on IE using iframes... you're still stuck with a file picker that can only selects one file at a time.
[12:02:57] <silverwind> That's why flash is often used with fileuploaders
[12:03:43] <rhelic> silverwind: I noticed, and that's out of the question, although I would love to have the whole upload status bar and etc
[12:04:02] <rhelic> I guess I'll just have to wait for a more compatible jQuery/HTML5 solution and better browser features... one day
[12:04:10] <rhelic> back to plain jane file upload then
[12:04:22] <silverwind> Heh.. :/
[12:07:37] <rhelic> btw, this looks like the best & most compatible fancy uploader of all of them   http://www.plupload.com/example_queuewidget.php
[12:08:00] <rhelic> but it's the best because it has tons of fallbacks: Flash, SilverLight, HTML5, jQuery
[12:08:03] <rhelic> all in 1 control
[12:10:18] <cluelesscoder> gah, can't seem to bind event handlers to dynamically created html using on, if anyone is up for giving me a clue the code is at http://www.badcapitalist.com/list.html
[12:14:33] <pinholecamera> hey folks, how goes?
[12:15:59] <pinholecamera> i'm trying to create an ajax search of sorts, and am using .keyup to detect changes in the text field. i'm noticing it is freezing up the browser at first. any ideas of methods to do this that are less resource intensive? http://pastebin.com/u0wV1EL1
[12:16:11] <bradmaxs> hey all,  I am using an ajax call to remove an item from the session and view.  It works for the first submit but then it seems the forms are dead when I send it back via json.
[12:18:06] <NoiseEee> pinholecamera: you can peek into http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[12:19:28] <pinholecamera> NoiseEee: thanks... i could see a delay helping. chrome is freaking out a bit. "Maximum call stack size exceeded "
[12:27:08] <pinholecamera> still seems to be hanging, perhaps even worse than before... even just on pageload now.
[12:28:05] <cluelesscoder> johnkpaul: thanks for your help earlier... if you've got a bit, I'd really appreciate a little guidance in making the .on work over at http://www.badcapitalist.com/list.html - I also tried putting the event handler code in a place where it wouldn't run until after my content was dynamically generated
[12:28:21] <cluelesscoder> but that doesn't seem to work
[12:30:34] <cluelesscoder> also made a new "createdButton" to do a very simple test of .on, but that doesn't seem to work either
[12:31:56] <dekna> i have some problem with :not selector. with: $('div.dir:not[.inactive] span') i get two span elements and the second is inside a <div class="dir inactive"> why? thx for any help
[12:32:58] <cluelesscoder> wait a second... may have figured out my issue
[12:33:45] <cluelesscoder> hmm, guess not
[12:34:27] <bradmaxs> I have a submit button that works when page is reloaded but when I rebuild it with an ajax response it doesn't fire - like the form is dead but the form is exactly the same as the hardcoded one?
[12:36:43] <dilvie> bradmaxs: are you losing the event handler? If the element itself is changing, you might want to use .delegate (or the somewhat new .on)
[12:38:17] <cluelesscoder> I've been sort of working with .on; finally got it to work on a little example but not on the main use yet - gotta make sure you put it in a place where it runs after the content is dynamically generated (I think)
[12:38:38] <bradmaxs> dilvie: I am not sure. The event handler is in a separate file (using html5 boilerplate).  I use $(".destinations").click(function() {}. The button has a class of .destinations.
[12:40:05] <bradmaxs> dilvie: I must be because I don't get any errors in the console once I submit again after the first submit.
[12:41:01] <bradmaxs> dilvie: thank you cluelesscoder: I'll give that a try.
[12:41:26] <NoiseEee> cluelesscoder: yes, if you're using .on for event delegation, you have it placed on an element that is a parent to the dynamically generated content
[12:41:35] <dilvie> bradmaxs: Try replacing that .click with .on('click', function ...
[12:42:03] <dilvie> bradmaxs: And make sure it's set on a parent element, not on the actual button you're swapping out. =)
[12:42:35] <bradmaxs> dilvie: ok thanks. trying now.
[12:44:20] <dilvie> cluelesscoder: As long as the element you're attaching to exists, you can use .on() at any time after page ready. The event listener is set up on the parent element, so it doesn't matter when the child elements get added to the dom, the parent will catch the event for the child. `this` inside the handler will refer to the element that was clicked.
[12:44:55] <dilvie> child = your actual target element.. parent = any ancestor to child
[12:45:18] <cluelesscoder> that might not be what I'm doing and maybe that's my mistake - but if I want to, say, click a button to delete a database record, I'm not sure how I would set the click to the parent element
[12:46:00] <cluelesscoder> I did get .on to work and it wasn't set on the parent element that I can see over at http://www.badcapitalist.com/list.html it set on a button that I dynamically generate
[12:47:26] <cluelesscoder> dilvie: I have a button that I click to load a records (each div is a record) from a database; I want a button to delete a record. I'm trying to run the .on after the loop that generates these divs but it is not working.
[12:47:39] <dilvie> cluelesscoder: A common pattern is you have a collection of things, say, on a UL or OL element... the collection is dynamically generated and added at any time, but the parent is on the page at page ready. You can do $('.collectionParent').on('click', '.childClass', function (event) { /* handler */}); )
[12:48:35] <cluelesscoder> dilvie: ah, ok... that's a fair bit more complicated than I was expecting and wasn't really clear from the examples
[12:48:57] <dilvie> no matter when the children appear in the dom, there is only one event listener, attached to the parent ul / ol / whatever. Since the events are delegated to the parent element, you don't need to attach new listeners every time the children change.
[12:49:30] <cluelesscoder> dilvie: however, I did get .on to attach to a child element which was dynamically generated - you can see it at the createdButton at http://www.badcapitalist.com/list.html
[12:49:57] <dilvie> It's actually a lot less complicated in practice than .click, because you don't have to worry about managing the event listeners when the elements on the page change.
[12:50:37] <dilvie> You set up the listener once, and then forget about it. Vs, setting up and tearing down every time your target elements change.
[12:50:47] <cluelesscoder> dilvie: I see - thanks
[12:51:42] <dilvie> It's also a big performance help, because every listener you add to the page adds resource overhead, so large collections can bog down the browser, cause memory leaks, browser crashes, and generally laggy UI interactions.
[12:51:56] <dilvie> So, lots of great reasons to use delegation vs attaching to each element.
[12:52:06] <cluelesscoder> dilvie: and now my event listeners work! awesome explanations here
[12:52:22] <dilvie> Glad I could help. =)
[12:54:32] <bradmaxs> dilvie: so it isn't working but I thought I would try something else.  My button: <button type="submit" class="delete_button destinations" onclick="removeDestination()"><img src="/img/button_delete.png" /></button>.  But then I get a Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function.
[12:54:55] <bradmaxs> Which seems like something else is wrong. ugh
[12:55:01] <nFFF> bradmaxs, link?
[12:55:12] <cluelesscoder> dilvie: by the way, http://api.jquery.com/on/ does not use the word 'parent' once
[12:55:29] <bradmaxs> nFFF:  it isn't live yet.
[12:55:49] <cluelesscoder> dilvie: neither does http://www.elijahmanor.com/2012/02/differences-between-jquery-bind-vs-live.html which discusses .on at the bottom
[12:56:50] <dilvie> cluelesscoder: sad documentation. );
[12:57:08] <cluelesscoder> dilvie: guess maybe they use synonyms, but it was going over my head... your explanation seemed very clear
[12:57:08] <dilvie> bradmaxs: Post an example to jsfiddle, and I'll show you the right way to do it.
[12:57:15] <alexwait> do you guys know what built in function makes it look nice when you print a jquery object to the console?
[12:57:24] <bradmaxs> dilvie: OK.
[12:57:30] <imachuchu> is there an easy way to have 2 different classes for 2 different jquery-ui autocomplete boxes in the same page (think "scrollable" and "not-scrollable")
[12:57:41] <dilvie> alexwait: JSON.stringify()
[12:58:05] <alexwait> what would cause that NOT to print pretty?
[12:58:09] <alexwait> even though it's a jquery object
[12:58:54] <NoiseEee> print pretty?
[12:59:03] <alexwait> yeah
[12:59:06] <alexwait> like
[12:59:08] <alexwait> for $('body')
[12:59:14] <alexwait> it prints [<body blah blah blah ]
[12:59:32] <nFFF> console.log ?
[12:59:41] <alexwait> console log doesn't dot he conversion :P
[12:59:47] <alexwait> something else must
[12:59:59] <NoiseEee> im really not sure what you're talking about
[13:00:18] <alexwait> take a jquery object
[13:00:20] <alexwait> print it to console
[13:00:23] <alexwait> what makes it look like that
[13:00:26] <NoiseEee> are you talking about https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/firequery/ ?
[13:00:30] <alexwait> an actual element you click on in the inspector
[13:00:33] <alexwait> it's not a firefox addon
[13:00:41] <nFFF> console.log. ...
[13:00:51] <alexwait> console logs doesn't do this!
[13:00:54] <alexwait> I can assure you
[13:01:00] <dilvie> alexwait: the browser handles that stuff.
[13:01:14] <bradmaxs> dilvie: http://jsfiddle.net/7Lfaf/1/ and thank you
[13:01:20] <alexwait> sometimes the console log output is incorrect
[13:01:24] <alexwait> it's just a plain javascript object
[13:01:37] <alexwait> it's missing all the jquery added function on it sprototype
[13:01:45] <alexwait> so I'm thinking one of those must help the browser get access to teh dom
[13:01:52] <alexwait> element that the object represents
[13:01:53] <dilvie> alexwait: are you sure it's the output, and not the INPUT that's incorrect?
[13:02:05] <alexwait> the output is only intermittently wrong
[13:02:13] <NoiseEee> alexwait: then its not a prototype object.
[13:02:17] <alexwait> somethign is happening to the jquery object before it is returned
[13:02:30] <alexwait> sometimes it's missing all its jquery helper functions
[13:02:33] <bradmaxs> dilvie: actually http://jsfiddle.net/7Lfaf/2/
[13:02:37] <NoiseEee> alexwait: then its not a prototype object.
[13:02:46] <alexwait> see: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=125148
[13:03:42] <NoiseEee> alexwait: what about it?
[13:04:17] <NoiseEee> also, s/prototype object/jquery object
[13:04:18] <alexwait> that's the behavior I am seeing
[13:04:31] <NoiseEee> alexwait: sounds like you should switch browsers to dev what you're devving then.
[13:04:43] <alexwait> it happens on ALL chrome versions
[13:04:44] <alexwait> not just 19
[13:04:45] <alexwait> 20
[13:04:46] <alexwait> 21
[13:04:50] <alexwait> all after 18
[13:04:58] <dilvie> bradmaxs: $('#removeDestination').on('click', '.destinations', function() {
[13:05:04] <NoiseEee> alexwait: super, though irrelevant to #jquery
[13:05:14] <alexwait> I was curious if there is any clue
[13:05:18] <Whirl3d> i use chrome every day and have for years now and haven't come across this probelm even once
[13:05:21] <alexwait> if I could figure out what function helps out the browser when printing
[13:05:27] <alexwait> it might help me
[13:05:31] <alexwait> download the 125148.zip file
[13:05:34] <alexwait> it's very easy to repo
[13:05:38] <NoiseEee> alexwait: its a BROWSER thing
[13:05:47] <alexwait> I know
[13:05:52] <alexwait> but I thought maybe I could work backwards
[13:06:01] <alexwait> if I figured out the console helper function or w/e it turns out ot be
[13:06:15] <alexwait> because when the __proto__ object on the jquery object isn't correct, the console output is wrong
[13:06:17] <dilvie> bradmaxs: you attach the .on to the parent (removeDestination), which is the delegate for a single event listener. jQuery handles listening to the child-emitted events, and gives you the child element as `this` in the handler.
[13:06:42] <Whirl3d> wait if the proto is wrong, the output still shows the jquery proto ?
[13:06:53] <Whirl3d> or the output shows that it's not the correct proto
[13:06:59] <bradmaxs> dilvie: I get what you guys were talking about now.  I thought you meant the html that gets regenerated:) thanks - trying it now.
[13:07:09] <Whirl3d> which is the correct behavior in browser contect
[13:07:15] <dilvie> bradmaxs: You're welcome. =)
[13:08:27] <stephens2424> I just saw that the async: false option in jQuery.ajax() is being deprecated as of 1.8. does someone know more about why or can you point me to something about it? I know the problems with synchronous calls, but I think it's the only way to accomplish what I'm working on right now
[13:09:17] <NoiseEee> stephens2424: and you're well aware of how callbacks work?
[13:09:24] <stephens2424> I am
[13:09:45] <stephens2424> I need to get a url from a server and then open it in a new tab or window, but not run afoul of pop up blockers
[13:10:04] <NoiseEee> not sure why that would would have anything to do with async/sync
[13:10:43] <bradmaxs> dilvie: that got it to work with the onclick in the button but then when it get's regenerated from the function I get a Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function?
[13:10:43] <stephens2424> at least in Chrome, the pop up blocker lets you through if it's a direct result of user interaction
[13:11:15] <stephens2424> but an asynchronous call decouples the response and the tab open from the user interaction
[13:11:30] <alexwait> Whirld3D: ina  correct jquery object __proto__ contains lots of jquery helper functions like live() height() etc. It also contains its own __proto__ object which contains the standard object methdo. Let's call it set X. In the error case, __proto__ contains JUST set X. No jquery int here at all
[13:11:43] <NoiseEee> innersting stephens2424, well you can always elect to not use jquery's ajax/xhr
[13:12:11] <bradmaxs> dilvie: http://jsfiddle.net/7Lfaf/7/
[13:12:40] <Whirl3d> alexwait, so you run into this problem a lot?
[13:12:52] <alexwait> with teh 125148.zip file, it happens 99% of the time upon refresh
[13:13:01] <alexwait> about say 10% of the time in our company's project
[13:13:26] <alexwait> It seems to be related to the number of jquery statements you've done "lately" but I'm not really sure to be perfectly honest
[13:13:27] <stephens2424> NoiseEee, true, but, just, ugh. I was hoping to at least read more about the decision and see if it's getting moved/replaced somehow instead of just deleted
[13:16:57] <Whirl3d> alexwait, but despite all this conjecture, you claim that it might help you solve the problem you are having...why not just ask about the problem you are having and see if someone can help.
[13:17:51] <dekna> someone has experience with jQuery-ui? i tried to use dialog form to uploade files with a multipart/form-data - form. If i use this form as normal form it works pretty well -> if i use it in dialog the form isn't submitted as multipart/form-data.
[13:17:58] <yedimind> noone has experience with jquery-ui
[13:21:36] <aFeijo> folks, what would be the couterpart of .ajaxComplete? the one when an ajax starts?
[13:22:46] <aFeijo> lol, I answered myself in my question... $.ajaxStart()
[13:25:12] <killtheliterate> If I'm doing something as basic as adding a class with addClass(), how do I contine to addClass to new DOM elements as their added? I can't add them in the callback that generates the new DOM element
[13:31:43] <bradmaxs> even though my function is working with my button - onclick="removeDesintation()", I am still getting Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function when I submit? any ideas
[13:32:31] <Whirl3d> bradmaxs, don't use inline event handlers. Use jquery to capture the click or better the submit event.
[13:32:52] <bradmaxs> ok
[13:44:29] <bradmaxs> Whirl3d: it works with submit but still having the problem that when my .html() content is returned with the new arrays, the buttons are dead but they are in forms? thank you.
[13:46:30] <Whirl3d> so the new html you load into a div.
[13:46:39] <Whirl3d> that div handles the.on
[13:47:19] <Whirl3d> like this: $.ajax(url, {success:function (data) {mydiv.html(data);}
[13:48:03] <Whirl3d> and mydiv=$("thediv"); mydiv.on("submit", "form", function (e) { handle the form submission using $(this) as the form
[13:49:13] <Whirl3d> now I may have that one step removed...when you apply mydiv.html(data)...you may actually need to handle the submit event on the parent of mydiv. I can't remember if html() method erases handlers
[13:50:04] <Whirl3d> regardless, by using .on in this manner, new forms will also be handled by the same hanlder without having to rebind them when loaded dynamincally.
[13:50:18] <novochar> is calling ajaxStart required or is it called automatically?
[13:50:26] <bradmaxs> Whirl3d: I'll post the code. and thank you
[13:51:18] <Whirl3d> build a fiddle if you are still having problems. I'll look at it and if I can't figure it out, there are lots of folks here who know A TON more than I do...so someone will be able to help.
[13:52:10] <bradmaxs> thank you.
[13:58:28] <bradmaxs> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/AvYEj/1/
[14:01:49] <Whirl3d> see the reason this might not work...just at first glance, is that you are binding the submit event to the forms that more than likely are added dynamically. Instead, try biding the submit handler to any forms using the .on handler on the "destinations" div, for example.
[14:02:08] <Whirl3d> --at first glance. It's a lot of code to look at. so lemme keep looking
[14:04:20] <evasivx_> Alright, maybe IRC can help me. Why is it sooo hard to find a conitnously scrolling image carasoul? You know, to like showcase logos or something
[14:04:57] <bradmaxs> Whirl3d: thank you.  I am not sure what you mean about putting the .on handler on the div?  In the function itself correct?  And the form will stay the same?
[14:05:24] <theDavidAtWork> evasivx_: I've started using slidejs and find it pretty easy to use: http://slidesjs.com
[14:05:28] <Whirl3d> I'm suggesting that your html markup should remain the same...
[14:06:23] <Whirl3d> but rather than $(".removeDestination").submit(....    you need to bind higher up in the dom...say "destinations" since it doesn't get replaced when the new ajax content is loaded
[14:07:05] <Whirl3d> does your function work once?
[14:07:22] <cluelesscoder> bradmaxs: dilvie explained it very well earlier as follows: cluelesscoder: A common pattern is you have a collection of things, say, on a UL or OL element... the collection is dynamically generated and added at any time, but the parent is on the page at page ready. You can do $('.collectionParent').on('click', '.childClass', function (event) { /* handler */}); )
[14:07:24] <bradmaxs> Whirl3d: OK.  Giving that a try!  It does work the first time
[14:08:20] <bradmaxs> cluelesscoder: thanks - this is all new to me so I am trying to grasp it all.  I do realize it is all probably the same and I an just not gietting it.
[14:08:27] <Whirl3d> than it should work every time if you bind it (using the 'on' metod, to the parent element that doesn't get replaced.
[14:08:29] <evasivx_> theDavidAtWork, no, like, constantly moving in one direction at a certain speed, looping...Like this, but that actually works when i try to implament it: http://coolcarousels.frebsite.nl/c/23/coolcarousel.html
[14:08:42] <evasivx_> Also that guy's is like 40kb packed
[14:12:09] <imachuchu> any reason that .clone wouldn't work with jquery-ui's autocomplete?
[14:12:24] <yedimind> evasivx_, look into jcarousellite
[14:12:31] <imachuchu> as in have autocomplete on a field, clone it, and autocomplete doesn't work on the new field
[14:12:34] <yedimind> http://www.gmarwaha.com/jquery/jcarousellite/
[14:12:36] <yedimind> its like 4k
[14:12:42] <yedimind> or "2" as he advertises it
[14:13:42] <MrSpoon> Hi, can I get specific html tags from a ajax request? I.e request a page and return jus div.class I want?
[14:14:06] <evasivx_> yedimind, thank you. I'll try this out right now
[14:14:17] <theDavidAtWork> evasivx_: Ah, sorry.  I was thinking slideshow.  My bad!
[14:14:40] <evasivx_> theDavidAtWork, unacceptable!
[14:14:43] <evasivx_> haha, thats alright :)
[14:15:55] <theDavidAtWork> evasivx: for what ti's worth, I spent WAY too much time looking at carrousels when what I really wanted was a slideshow.  One would think I would remember the difference! (it was only a month ago!!!)
[14:16:41] <evasivx> theDavidAtWork, hahaha, yeah I've been trying to reword google searches all morning because i keep getting slideshows!
[14:18:52] <Whirl3d> i have extended the jquery.fn object with an "announce" method and wondered if I bind the announce method to another function on element, will I still have to use .trigger or can I use .announce on the new element. $("elem").bind("announce", $.proxy("announce", this));  $("elem").announce()...will that call the announce method on "elem"?
[14:20:52] <dekna> i have some problems with $.ajax i tried to post some "multipart/form-data", with http://pastebin.com/g9qJTaZm what have i done wrong?
[14:21:37] <Whirl3d> and now that I am thinking about it. how do I setup my plugin to work like jquery in so much as $(elem).plugin()  calls the plugin method, but $(elem).plugin(handler) sets up a handler for the plugin method?
[14:21:43] <novochar> jspaste.com/?id=397
[14:21:54] <novochar> i don't understand how this works
[14:22:41] <novochar> is this a rails thing? that <script> following immediately a link_to function associates the script with the post?
[14:22:55] <novochar> what the link is, in this the post
[14:22:56] <Whirl3d> why do y'all keep using these weird-ass paste services when jsfiddle works so much better, gives you a testbed and makes it so much easier to provide help?
[14:23:29] <novochar> i don't understand the point of having html css and js forms when all i need is js
[14:24:05] <Whirl3d> well all you need usually isn't js
[14:24:16] <Whirl3d> or you wouldnt be in the #jquery channel
[14:27:10] <dekna> k i didn't know jfiddle, but i think it's just a misconfiguration in $.ajax({}); ... i didn't found a solution till now
[14:28:14] <novochar> jquery is js?
[14:28:24] <Whirl3d> yup.
[14:28:35] <novochar> then your point is invalid! ;)
[14:28:56] <Whirl3d> show me an example where you use jquery without html or css.
[14:29:14] <bradmaxs> cluelesscoder:, Whirl3d: It is working now but when I submit with the .on, it is submitting all of the forms id's instead of the current form that I am clicking on. http://jsfiddle.net/AvYEj/2/
[14:29:57] <Whirl3d> bradmaxs, you need to cache $(this) inside the handler
[14:30:09] <Whirl3d> $(this) will refer to the form that submitted the event
[14:30:50] <Whirl3d> var data=$(this).serialize();   for example
[14:32:32] <Whirl3d> novochar, any examples you can think of where somehow jquery is loaded without html or css...
[14:32:41] <Whirl3d> I mean it's possible I suppose...
[14:32:51] <Whirl3d> I just honestly don't know of any.
[14:33:04] <bradmaxs> Whirl3d: YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  You got it!  Thank you so much everyone!  I know you already said this in previous lines but it takes me a bit:)  Thank you for your patience.
[14:33:07] <Whirl3d> maybe an idevice or some bs?
[14:33:21] <Whirl3d> congrats!
[14:33:49] <bradmaxs> thanks again!
[14:35:55] * thang dies
[14:39:25] <Whirl3d> so, folks wanna say that it is more elegant to define the methods and properties of an object using it's prototype for inheritance...but does that hold true if you encapsulate a bunch of methods in an unrelated object literal and extends the prototype with the object literal using $.extend or is it only more elegant when definining every method/property individually?
[14:39:41] <Koganei> so I've got $("#myDiv") and I want to include content INSIDE the div, append and prepend seem to put it before or after
[14:40:28] <Whirl3d> append puts it into the div after the existing content.  prepend puts it in the div before the existing content
[14:40:55] <Whirl3d> .after puts the content after and .before puts the content before
[14:41:26] <Koganei> hm
[14:41:34] <elijah> Hey guys, I just learned I can use JS to replace text with innerText, can someone point me to a quick sample on how to chain selectors, does it work like CSS? I am new to JS but know a little PHP.
[14:41:35] <Whirl3d> jsfiddle, maybe?
[14:41:42] <Koganei> yeah I'll look further into it
[14:41:47] <novochar> here's my question: http://pastie.org/private/7okzc139rkczefhccimxq
[14:42:18] <Koganei> oh yeah
[14:42:24] <Koganei> it is doing it right, just hadn't thought my code through :p
[14:42:44] <Whirl3d> novochat, really? imr,
[14:42:57] <elijah> I want to select the innerText of an a element inside an ID, this is what I would use for CSS "#parentwrapper a"
[14:43:29] <Whirl3d> $("#parentwrapper a").text(sometext);
[14:43:32] <elijah> But I want to replace the contents of what is in between the <a> element
[14:43:47] <Whirl3d> should work
[14:45:22] <elijah> very nice Whirl3d
[14:45:58] <elijah> Whirl3d: Is that selector pattern only for JQ or JS too?
[14:46:34] <Whirl3d> it's for jquery...but you could get to the html element using $("#inner a")[0];
[14:47:34] <Whirl3d> so, $("a").text('sometext') is similar to $("a")[0].innerText="sometext"     (I may be off on the exact function signature. but that's the idea)
[14:48:18] <elijah> Whirl3d: Much appreciated, that gives me a good idea
[14:50:54] <cantonic> hey guys. how do you find out in firefox/chrome which javascript function is called when clicking a button?
[14:51:30] <novochar> does the jQuery stand for $ in this: jQuery.ajax( url [, settings] )
[14:51:38] <novochar> $.ajax would be the call, right?
[14:51:45] <cantonic> novochar: yes
[14:52:14] <novochar> awesome, thanks cantonic
[15:02:24] <Apetrini> Hi to all! There is a weird behaviour that I can't understand. Basically I have "$( "#foo_id" ).click(submit_data);" and it works, when I click on the input(foo_id), submit_data() is executed. Now I have to execute something like submit_data('foo_data'), but using "$( "#foo_id" ).click(submit_data('foo_data'));" the function is triggered immediately and not on click.
[15:02:39] <Apetrini> any hint is really apreciated, :-)
[15:02:42] <Apetrini> thanks
[15:04:04] <Whirl3d> you are assigning the result of a function call to handle a method...
[15:04:12] <Whirl3d> var result=function () {}
[15:04:16] <Whirl3d> but
[15:05:05] <Whirl3d> var result = somefunc(44);
[15:05:13] <Whirl3d> is different.
[15:05:34] <Whirl3d> You are using the second "result" as your click handler, so it gets resolved immediately
[15:05:48] <Whirl3d> submit_data(somevalues) immediately resolves
[15:06:03] <Whirl3d> whereas submit_data is a function that only gets resolved on click
[15:06:33] <Whirl3d> so, wrap it in an anonymous function to make it work the way you want...
[15:06:51] <Whirl3d> $("elem").click(function () {submit_data(foo);});
[15:07:03] <Whirl3d> now foo will be passed to submit_data on click
[15:07:43] <Apetrini> Whirl3d: I completely understand your explanation, really thanks!!!!
[15:07:54] <Whirl3d> right on.
[15:09:04] <Whirl3d> shoky, are you around today?
[15:13:38] <Whirl3d> so, why is it that when I bind an event to an element using .bind. I have to call trigger on the element to trigger the event...for custom events only...
[15:13:56] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/2KGyc/13/
[15:25:41] <dilvie> Whirl3d: As of jQuery 1.7, the .on() method is the preferred method for attaching event handlers to a document. For earlier versions, the .bind() method is used for attaching an event handler directly to elements.
[15:25:48] <dilvie> google jQuery .on
[15:26:01] <dilvie> assuming you have jQuery 1.7+
[15:27:05] <dilvie> Whirl3d: For custom events, the only way the event can ever be triggered is if you trigger it with .trigger.
[15:27:50] <nFFF> Exactly
[15:27:50] <dilvie> For the same reason that if you want to answer a phone call, somebody first has to call your phone.
[15:27:57] <nFFF> how else is it suppose to trigger?
[15:30:43] <Hereisanotherlie> how would I get in touch with whoever is working on the new plugin site?
[15:34:26] <yannickoo> Hey guys, why I cannot get my animation delay? http://jsfiddle.net/CtcJp/
[15:35:32] <novochar> what's wrong with this ajax call? http://pastie.org/private/fsbcndxfdjgg8kfk7cnj9g
[15:35:36] <novochar> lines 40-50
[15:35:50] <Hereisanotherlie> yannickoo: theres no query in that fiddle
[15:35:52] <novochar> i'm trying to use this in a bookmarklet
[15:36:09] <yannickoo> Hereisanotherlie: right but i thought that here are the cool webkitters
[15:36:11] <Hereisanotherlie> jquery*
[15:36:37] <elemenope> How can i change the gray color that highlights the option tag in a multiple select? http://jsfiddle.net/aqGtu/ if you choose any and then click outside the one you chose will have a gray background.
[15:37:07] <novochar> the POST request is being sent to the site that the user is on but i want to be sent to a specific url which i have specified as part of the ajax options
[15:39:55] <Hereisanotherlie> novochar: idk but you should make a body variable as a start I think
[15:40:03] <Hereisanotherlie> so you don't have to jump into the dom every time
[15:42:18] <novochar> Hereisanotherlie: i don't understand
[15:43:08] <Hereisanotherlie> every time you do $('body') that's another time that jquery has to jump into the dom
[15:43:50] <Hereisanotherlie> if you do something like " var body = $('body'); you can speed things up a bit and make the code just a bit cleaner
[15:44:29] <Whirl3d> nFFF, how does .click trigger? or any of the native jQuery methods that can be triggered using .trigger or by calling them natively...
[15:45:35] <Hereisanotherlie> novochar: then you can call it with something like body.on('click')â¦..
[15:45:45] <nFFF> Whirl3d, they are native events
[15:45:55] <novochar> or in the case of my code
[15:45:57] <novochar> body.append
[15:46:01] <Hereisanotherlie> exactly
[15:46:02] <Whirl3d> and dilvie, tanks for the info. I am well aware of the preferred method of binding events. If you look through the log, I help people with that all day...
[15:46:21] <Whirl3d> nFFF, what makes them different from extending the prototype?
[15:46:27] <novochar> to declare it globally so that all functions can access the variable it's probably better to do something like body = $('body')
[15:46:32] <novochar> instead of var body ...
[15:46:47] <nFFF> Whirl3d, language and browser recognition? :)
[15:47:20] <zamba> i'm clicking on a row and selecting that click with .click().. and now i want to do something with only the tds underneath that row.. i know the class of the td, but using that as a selector means all other tds with that class will be selected
[15:47:30] <zamba> so how can i just select the classes underneath $(this)?
[15:47:57] <Whirl3d> maybe...perhaps there is a code in the jQuery code that says, "here are my native, non-extended functions, so it's okay to trigger them...but don't trigger anything new.
[15:48:26] <Whirl3d> zamba, use .find
[15:48:45] <zamba> Whirl3d: but someone told me the other day that .find() was very ineffective, as it has to search the whole DOM tree?
[15:48:50] <zamba> there's no other alternative?
[15:48:58] <Whirl3d> they were wrong
[15:49:08] <Whirl3d> .find() searches below the element that calls it
[15:49:12] <zamba> ah, sweet, ok
[15:49:21] <Whirl3d> so $(document).find() searches the whole tree, maybe
[15:49:26] <nFFF> Whirl3d, click etc are all native javascript events
[15:49:31] <nFFF> jquery is just a wrap around them
[15:49:39] <shoky> yo Whirl3d
[15:49:47] <Whirl3d> shoky!
[15:50:09] <shoky> ;]
[15:50:27] <Whirl3d> so you can only use trigger to trigger native js methods wrapped by jquery on the core then is what youa re saying nFFF, right?
[15:51:32] <Hereisanotherlie> novochar: you're also calling two versions of jquery once on line 7 and again on line 13
[15:52:06] <nFFF> no you use trigger to trigger both native and custom events
[15:52:48] <nFFF> native events are obviously treated differently then custom ones
[15:53:23] <Whirl3d> shoky, I was trying to figure out a way to override a custom method an an element in my plugin...So the plugin works like $.fn.announce which gives elements access to $(this).announce....but in native jquery code, you can do $(elem).bind('nativeEvent', function () {  and $(elem).trigger('native func') __or__$(elem).nativeFunc will trigger the same event
[15:53:32] <novochar> Hereisanotherlie: most of this isn't my code, it's just something i found
[15:53:43] <novochar> but line 13 only loads jquery if jqpath isn't specified
[15:54:03] <nFFF> custom method?
[15:54:06] <nFFF> or custom event?
[15:54:07] <Whirl3d> whereas $(elem).bind("announce", func) will only fire the "func" using trigger, not $(elem).announce
[15:54:41] <shoky> by $(elem).nativeFunc  you mean like $(elem).click() ?
[15:54:44] <Whirl3d> $.fn.announce=function () {alert (this.attr('title'));}  for example
[15:54:51] <Whirl3d> right.
[15:55:22] <Whirl3d> like $(elem).click()  is similar to $(elem).trigger('click');
[15:55:39] <shoky> it's a shortcut for that, yeah
[15:55:42] <Whirl3d> but $(elem).announce() is not similar to $(elem).trigger("announce');
[15:55:55] <shoky> it would be if you define it that way ;;
[15:55:55] <shoky> ;p
[15:56:01] <nFFF> $.fn.announce() { this.trigger('announce'); }
[15:56:02] <nFFF> ?
[15:56:12] <nFFF> im confuzzled
[15:56:27] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/2KGyc/13/
[15:56:53] <Whirl3d> the custom "announce" method alerts some text
[15:57:35] <nFFF> yes...
[15:57:43] <Whirl3d> when I bind the "announce" method to another function using.bind()...the new function only gets called with .trigger...not with the announce method
[15:58:17] <Koganei> so can I do $("<div></div>").click( function() { } ).append("#myOtherDiv"); or does it have to already be in the DOM to use click()?
[15:58:18] <shoky> mm
[15:58:25] <shoky> you don't bind methods
[15:58:28] <nFFF> you are bindning it to a element
[15:58:30] <nFFF> not method
[15:58:39] <shoky> oh .bind
[15:58:40] <shoky> er
[15:58:50] <shoky> im confused if you mean jq .bind or js .bind
[15:59:26] <shoky> ok jq .bind
[15:59:48] <Whirl3d> in my fiddle, use the .bind method from jquery to bind the function testAnnounce in the scope of my oject to what I thought was the announce method/event
[16:00:31] <Whirl3d> and element.trigger("announce") works as expected...it logs the message to the console.
[16:00:50] <Whirl3d> but elem.announce() doesn't fire the "announce" event?
[16:01:10] <Whirl3d> thereby triggering the bound announceHandler?
[16:01:14] <Whirl3d> not sure
[16:01:31] <shoky> elem.announce is just calling the testAnnounce
[16:01:39] <shoky> which logs to the console
[16:01:54] <shoky> no events triggered, because you didnt trigger any in testAnnounce
[16:02:12] <shoky> elem.click() is a shortcut to .trigger because they defined it that way
[16:02:39] <jyg> any bootstrap experts?
[16:02:48] <shoky> er
[16:03:02] <shoky> sorry that was wrong
[16:03:08] <Whirl3d> So, in my plugin I need to define $.fn.annouce=function () elem.trigger('announce');
[16:03:11] <jyg> is it possible to fill a model with a fetch() when not using Collection?
[16:03:26] <Whirl3d> and then bind announce to the elemen using bind?
[16:04:27] <Whirl3d> but 'click' or any other triggerable method is more than just an alias for trigger...isn't it?
[16:04:54] <shoky> not when called with no arguments
[16:05:09] <Whirl3d> aha.
[16:06:13] <Whirl3d> but wait, you can pass arguments using .trigger...
[16:06:15] <shoky> return arguments.length > 0 ? this.on( name, null, data, fn ) : this.trigger( name );
[16:07:17] <shoky> you can't pass argument for the click trigger using $().click()
[16:07:25] <shoky> arguments*
[16:07:27] <Whirl3d> or do I need to just create a new jquery.Event object?
[16:07:50] <shoky> hrm i'm not sure what your intended result is
[16:08:47] <Whirl3d> I want to define a method that I can locally override for an element.
[16:10:00] <Whirl3d> not every jquery object will be able to use the "announce" method because it checks to see if the caller has the required parameters to complete the function. if not it returns null. if so, it announces.
[16:10:44] <Whirl3d> but some items, I would like to override that behavior and proxy it out so that even though element b doesn't have the requirements to complete the annnounce function, it fires a proxy that will.
[16:12:16] <zamba> i'm looking for a way to get return values from my ajax calls.. what do you guys generally do? the ajax calls usually manipulates the database in some way, so if it's an insert it's pretty easy to just return the inserted value.. but what if the query fails? what do you guys do here?
[16:12:23] <zamba> change the status code?
[16:16:04] <Whirl3d> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/gGZU9/4/
[16:26:14] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/gGZU9/7/    commented out line by line
[16:31:53] <shoky> Whirl3d i didnt take a look at your last 2 fiddles yet,
[16:32:08] <shoky> but i came up with this http://jsfiddle.net/2KGyc/14/
[16:32:21] <shoky> no idea if that's anything close to what you meant though ;P
[16:32:22] <Koganei> http://jsfiddle.net/sUwJ4/ <-- This is wrong. Trying to get the xml item node and put all the attributes as objects of portfolio[j], can't seem to figure out what to put after $(this) in the for loop :o
[16:32:34] <Koganei> sorry as properties of portfolio*
[16:34:55] <bradmaxs_> just ran into a interesting sitch.  a piece of data that I am sending to my view with .html has an apostrophe in it.  How do I escape that?

[16:41:53] <ezakimak> well, the sender has to send valid json
[16:42:36] <ezakimak> valid json uses double quotes around object member names
[16:42:49] <ezakimak> (valid strings)
[16:42:59] <bradmaxs_> ezakimak: hmmm.  Ok - this gives me something to look for. thank yu

[17:01:39] <madprops> is there a way to go to an anchor after page loads, without using the scrollTo plugin?
[17:01:42] <shoky> hmm no.
[17:03:38] <Whirl3d> I want the method name (stored in pub) to be bound to the proxy which calls the same named func on the publisher object
[17:05:46] <shoky> so how does that line do that
[17:06:06] <Whirl3d> so var someObj={talk:function (txt) {alert (txt);}};   $(elem).bind("talk", $.proxy("talk", someObj)); then $(elem).trigger('talk', "i'm talking"); should alert I'm talking
[17:06:28] <shoky> so first of all its  .proxy( context, name )
[17:07:08] <Whirl3d> I always get that confused with .proxy(function, context);
[17:07:17] <Whirl3d> so similar, weird that they are so different.
[17:07:23] <shoky> but in that line you have a name and a function, no context ;P
[17:07:33] <shoky> here i mean- $.proxy(pub, function() {  subscribers.fire();  })
[17:08:18] <Whirl3d> oh yeah, so pub is the publisher object...and the proxy is right, I must've used it wrong in the bind..
[17:09:10] <Whirl3d> no, pub is the publisher object and btw it works
[17:09:24] <shoky> waaat
[17:09:35] <Whirl3d> you can see that it logs the correct value when it says "announcing " eventobj
[17:09:48] <shoky> is it  proxy( context, name )   or  proxy( function, context ) ?
[17:10:12] <Whirl3d> in this case, it's context, name
[17:10:23] <Whirl3d> pub is the context.
[17:10:25] <shoky> $.proxy(pub, function() {  subscribers.fire();  })
[17:10:40] <Whirl3d> see. I have too many versions floating around...
[17:10:48] <Whirl3d> I am looking at an updated version. LOL
[17:10:51] <shoky> isn't pub just a method name
[17:10:52] <shoky> ohh
[17:10:57] <shoky> ;D
[17:14:21] <Whirl3d> Shoky...here is an example of what I currently would do to handle events on a ball and its shadow: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/bMgXn/5/
[17:15:13] <Whirl3d> I would like to instead have the ball "announce" that it is dragging, stopping, starting, etc.
[17:15:33] <Whirl3d> and then have the shadow, subscribe to the drag, stop, start announcement.
[17:15:53] <shoky> could you write how you'd use the API
[17:15:58] <shoky> in that fiddle
[17:16:00] <Whirl3d> and maybe some other element subscribe to those events to act differently
[17:16:07] <Whirl3d> sure. brb
[17:22:50] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/bMgXn/6/
[17:23:31] <Whirl3d> all.announce of course should be ball.announce... lol
[17:26:27] <Whirl3d> now, if you had another element that responded to the ball's position, it would subscribe to the ball's announcements for dragMove as well using ball.subscribe("dragMove",reactor.dragMove);
[17:37:14] <hex`> Why is this .animate() not working? http://jsfiddle.net/qkPbt/1/
[17:39:51] <hex`> nevermind, the docs explain it
[17:50:48] <yannickoo> Hey guys, why I'm getting an undefined? jQuery.browser.msie && jQuery.browser.version < 10
[17:50:56] <yannickoo> I just pasted that in my console
[17:53:27] <Ernston> should: $(document).ready(function()  be at the head or foot of your script ?
[17:55:50] <Whirl3d> Ernston, the beauty of it is that it can go anywhere since it's only going to execute on document ready
[17:56:05] <Whirl3d> I prefer the header along with all my other scripts
[17:58:11] <Ernston> am a noob and having probs
[17:58:52] <Ernston> i was using onlick=  but am trying to get $('#findme').click to work
[18:02:11] <Hereisanotherlie> Ernston: it should be at the beginning
[18:02:20] <Hereisanotherlie> that is how it is typically done
[18:02:45] <Hereisanotherlie> but it could be anywhere, that's correct
[18:04:13] <Whirl3d> Ernston, if you pasted your code (html, css, and js) at jsfiddle.net, then share the code here, it'd be easier to help if you have problems.
[18:04:30] <Whirl3d> shared the url here..sry
[18:07:47] <shoky> he was doing .click( findMe() )  ;P
[18:10:34] <shoky> Whirl3d i'll take another stab at your thing sometime, keep posting updates  ;p
[18:24:54] <Forbidd3n> Anyone here know the best way to size an image so it will show up in bgstretcher correctly?
[18:25:33] <shapr> when I call $.get(url,data); does it actually return the result?
[18:25:42] <shapr> or will it only pass the result to a success function?
[18:26:31] <NoelB> Hello.  Has anyone experienced draggable crashing after the first drag in 1.8.21?  I recently upgraded from 1.8.1 to fix issues with scrollable divs & fixed position helpers (which worked), but now draggable completely dies after the first time it is executed.  Have tried using on() to recreate draggable() on mouseenter, but nothing seems to fix it.
[18:26:34] * shapr reads http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1639555/jquery-return-get-data-in-a-function
[18:27:35] <Whirl3d> I'll open a gist on it in case you want to look at it. You can see how it could be really useful, right? I don't want to invest too much more time if it's not really going to be of any use cause it's already handled another way better...
[18:27:49] <Whirl3d> thanks for your help/insight too, btw
[18:30:12] <Ernston> anyone used google map directions ?
[18:33:06] <maslo> hi guys im trying to use fancybox and it's working the way it should except that it doesn't center itself correctly, probably due to its absolute css position starting at 100px away from the top, is there anyway to tell the plugin that the image is 100px higher? it should do the trick
[18:33:51] <Ernston> tried margin or padding top ?
[18:45:05] <zamba> i have two selects that has the same values in them.. now i want to make sure that when i select one of the values in either of the selects, that the corresponding option "disappears" or is greyed out in the other
[18:45:16] <zamba> it's basically two selects to pick home and away teams for a tournament
[18:45:21] <NoelB> Anyone using draggable() with divs & li's located in fixed/absolute divs? 1.8.21 is not performing drag after the first time using a helper
[18:45:38] <zamba> so it won't make much sense selecting the same team as home and away
[18:47:25] <javalover> hi guys, i'm running a query like this  var a = $(".myclass");   a.mouseup(function(){console.log("I was clicked");}    but it's logging it 4 times wtf?
[18:47:48] <javalover> oh i missed a );  in my statement but that's psuedo code
[18:47:51] <NoelB> do you have 4 links on the page ?
[18:47:52] <Eviltwin> Is that code inside a loop or inside anothe event listener?
[18:48:11] <javalover> I have like 50 but i'm only clicking one of them
[18:48:14] <NoelB> drm. what Eviltwin says
[18:48:28] <javalover> that code is in a function that goes off after I compile my code
[18:48:34] <javalover> I.E. make the html block & send it
[18:48:53] <javalover> so I make like newHTML  then I run that function & it adds everything to the html
[18:48:54] <Eviltwin> Can you throw a console.log right before the a.mouseup and verify that it's not being run multiple times?
[18:49:01] <javalover> yes one sec
[18:49:03] <javalover> actually
[18:49:06] <javalover> ur right!
[18:49:17] <javalover> yup based on what i'm doing ur right
[18:49:29] <javalover> hmmmm but now how to fix the fact that I call this everytime
[18:49:46] <javalover> see I have like 4 sections of links that are being generated
[18:49:53] <javalover> and each section calls this....oh I know
[18:50:18] <NoelB> why not:  $('.myclass').unbind('mouseup').mouseup(function() {  your code  });
[18:50:19] <javalover> instead of $(".myclass"); I should run   mydivobject.find(".myclass");
[18:50:31] <javalover> no cuz it's just, it's doing it for everything
[18:50:34] <javalover> instead of just for tha tsection
[18:51:02] <javalover> I think to unbind it would be kinda pointless
[18:51:04] <Eviltwin> What you should do is use event delegation
[18:51:06] <javalover> that would work 2 though ur right
[18:51:08] <Eviltwin> (Not what NoelB said)
[18:51:22] <javalover> well how do I make it so it only finds for within the div?
[18:51:35] <Eviltwin> Use $(document).on('mouseup', '.myclass', function() { ... }) once outside of any other function
[18:51:46] <Eviltwin> Make sure that only gets called once
[18:51:53] <Eviltwin> But it will apply to future elements
[18:51:58] <javalover> but it's not that it only gets called once
[18:52:05] <javalover> it's  the fact that i'm adding to it multiple times
[18:52:25] <javalover> since i'm looping this i'm adding it 4 times
[18:52:38] <javalover> if i would just add once per object i'd be fine
[18:52:46] <javalover> is there a way to check to see if an event exist?
[18:52:50] <javalover> maybe I could do that instead like "if event doesn't exist"
[18:53:41] <zamba> so no one has any idea how i can solve my problem?
[18:53:50] <javalover> zamba what is your issue
[18:53:54] <javalover> as I think I can easily solve mine now
[18:54:02] <javalover> thx to eviltwin :-)
[18:54:21] <Eviltwin> javalover: You're doing something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/QKx2e/
[18:54:37] <NoelB> javalover:  I use event delegation and it works great, you just need to set something up that can take care of all of your "global" events at one time.  They will live for the duration of the script so you can count on those events always hanging around.
[18:54:47] <javalover> that's correct evil twin
[18:54:56] <Eviltwin> javalover: You want to do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/VNv56/
[18:54:57] <javalover> and i didn't even fully read it I can just see the add();add(); and I know ur right
[18:55:45] <zamba> javalover: i have two identical selects (with different name), meaning they contain the same options.. it's two selects for selecting home and away team for a match.. and i want to have it so that the two selects can't have the same option selected
[18:55:47] <Eviltwin> Sorry, this: http://jsfiddle.net/XBCRM/
[18:55:56] <Eviltwin> Notice that the syntax changed slightly
[18:55:57] <zamba> either by disabling or by removing
[18:55:59] <Eviltwin> And moved
[18:56:21] <Eviltwin> zamba: What are they set to when they start?
[18:56:31] <Eviltwin> zamba: How do you propse the user switches the two?
[18:56:41] <zamba> Eviltwin: right now the first option (which is the same, of course)
[18:56:46] <javalover> k I try urs
[18:56:48] <zamba> Eviltwin: by selecting.. ?
[18:56:49] <ccowan> Anyone have a fix for 12030 errors in IE9 using $.ajax to POST to a web service?
[18:57:03] <NoelB> Eviltwin: Where can i see the changelog difference between UI 1.8.12 and 1.8.18 ?  In 1.8.18 and later, I can't get my helper to initiate after a drag is initiated one time.
[18:57:12] <ccowan> The only information I can find is on IE6 and IE7
[18:57:25] <Eviltwin> NoelB: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/
[18:57:51] <zamba> Eviltwin: the user picks a team in one of the select and then the other select has to accomodate the change by either greying out ore removing the same option in its select.. and vice versa
[18:58:36] <Eviltwin> zamba: So in the starting state, one of then will be something like: [1] 3 4 5 and the other will be like [2] 3 4 5
[18:58:41] <Eviltwin> Where the [] is the selected one
[18:58:56] <javalover> still does it 3 times I think I have to check before adding it.
[18:58:58] <zamba> Eviltwin: well.. js have to fix the starting state as well
[18:59:12] <Eviltwin> Fix it how?
[18:59:13] <zamba> Eviltwin: since html will generate both as [1] 2 3 4 5
[18:59:15] <javalover> orrrrrr oh i'm doing it in reverse
[18:59:21] <javalover> focus on zamba i'm fine :=-)
[18:59:30] <zamba> hehe
[18:59:32] <zamba> yeah, focus on me :)
[19:01:33] <NoelB> Is the jqueryui.com support area the best place to log a bug?
[19:02:59] <zamba> i have no idea, but i guess the best place to go to bug a log is the forest :)
[19:03:09] <zamba> (it's 4 am here, don't mind me :p)
[19:03:26] <Forbidd3n> I am using bgstretcher for a div section that stretches image to browser width. The issue is when I make the computer screen res larger, 1024x768, it doesn't fit right, but if I do it at a larget size, it looks fine.
[19:03:29] <Forbidd3n> Ideas?
[19:04:27] <javalover> ok so I took the lazy way out & just did the unbind lol
[19:04:36] <javalover> it's such a waste of cpu but whatever it works for now lol
[19:04:48] <NoelB> looking at jqueryui.com, it looks like draggable is in pretty bad shape.  what a shame.
[19:05:07] <javalover> I understand that putting the function outside of my existing function would work as well but i'm lazy lol
[19:05:35] <javalover> atleast I understand how it works, did anyone fix zamba yet?
[19:06:02] <zamba> zamba's unfixable
[19:06:05] <Forbidd3n> anyone one on bgstretcher question, please?
[19:06:12] <zamba> i believe Eviltwin's on it, though
[19:06:34] <javalover> have you tried resizing your image on resize?
[19:06:44] <Eviltwin> zamba: How does this work for you? http://jsfiddle.net/YN2Lr/
[19:07:03] <Forbidd3n> javalover: that is what bgstretcher does, correct?
[19:07:12] <javalover> oh i'm no expert
[19:07:12] <zamba> Eviltwin: oh! perfect!
[19:07:25] <javalover> are you saying you load it in your browser at a large size?
[19:07:27] <Eviltwin> Acutally, this is more concise: http://jsfiddle.net/YN2Lr/1/
[19:07:33] <javalover> or dod you load in browser then change the pixel size & it breaks?
[19:07:36] <javalover> do*
[19:07:49] <zamba> Eviltwin: let's see if i'm able to adapt that to my code :)
[19:08:00] <Eviltwin> I gotta go catch a bus
[19:08:03] <Eviltwin> Good luck!
[19:08:11] <javalover> laters eviltwin
[19:08:36] <javalover> so forbidden how exactly are you breaking it what are the steps?
[19:08:52] <javalover> like if you refresh page does it fix to new pixel size?
[19:08:59] <javalover> or does it not ever work at 1024x768?
[19:10:59] <ccowan> My request isn't even hitting the server
[19:11:13] <ccowan> it's like it gets stuck
[19:11:29] <ccowan> this is only happening in SHITTY IE
[19:13:06] <javalover> yo FUCK IE!
[19:13:46] <javalover> such a challenge, it's like coding for a nintendo wii & then trying to code for it's mentally challenged nephew the virtual boy.
[19:15:19] <javalover> and everyone always hates 2, they're like "this site sucks" and ur like what browser you have "explorer" like gdamnit YOU SUCK WTF GET FIREFOX!
[19:15:30] <javalover> I might even put this on my site "don't have firefox go eff yourself GET FIREFOX TO SEE IT!"
[19:16:12] <javalover> cuz I show em the site on firefox & they're like "wow this is actually really cool looking wtf learn how to code this for explorer" and i'm like suck a dick.
[19:18:39] <eduardo12> how do I get the html of an object list of divs?
[19:19:39] <dilvie> Whirl3d: If you're still hanging around, jQuery's .click() (and a few other native event names) is a polymorphic method. If you pass in data to bind a click handler, it will set up the listener. If you call it directly, it will internally do a .trigger('click'...
[19:20:36] <zamba> i hate the newest firefox
[19:20:42] <zamba> the web developer tools there are so hidden
[19:20:50] <zamba> chrome's tools are much easier accessible
[19:23:20] <zamba> how do you guys handle errors through ajax?
[19:23:39] <zamba> if there's an database error that prevents some records being inserted into a database, for instance?
[19:24:05] <eduardo12> var allPages = $('[data-role="page"]');
[19:24:31] <eduardo12> I want to do this allPages[0].html() to get the html, but it don't work
[19:26:10] <eduardo12> if I alert allPages[0], then I get [object HTMLDivElement]
[19:46:52] <howardgrigg> hey I'm inspired by the slider on the iOS app store and want to try recreate it - something like this https://skitch.com/e-howardgrigg/ebgbj/skitched-20120616-124530
[19:47:26] <howardgrigg> anyone know a plugin that I could useâ¦?
[19:47:53] <Ernston> anyone used google api v3 directions ?
[19:47:55] <Whirl3d> dilvie, thanks for the info. I guess I was just wondering how to mimic that...plus I have been trying to figure out the best way to accept multiple parameter configurations gracefully.
[20:01:05] <dilvie> Whirl3d: I don't think it's a good idea to try to mimic it, because every name you add to $.fn is a name collision waiting to happen, and event names tend to be extremely generic (making the chances of collision relatively high).
[20:01:27] <dilvie> Whirl3d: Better just to .trigger('eventName' payload);
[20:01:49] <dilvie> most developers should be familiar with the .trigger() conventions, anyway.
[20:04:15] <dilvie> $ and $.fn should be treated like global playgrounds, which means that you should avoid assigning names to them that are likely to collide with names created by jQuery plugins, etc..
[20:07:53] <Koganei> so, I've got an animate on a class with multiple (say, 8) elements, and I want to queue a function after it, but it gets called 8 times :o
[21:05:33] <AlecTaylor> hi
[21:05:34] <AlecTaylor> What is the sequence for authentication on a decoupled [i.e.: javascript] client? - http://programmers.stackexchange.com/q/153106
[21:06:19] <Whirl3d> dilvie, agreed. Still, I figure that the logical progression of the $.Callbacks object is a more refined pubsub system that belongs if not in the core, certainly closer than to the core than some of the existing core methods.
[21:07:53] <Eviltwin> https://gist.github.com/661855
[21:08:43] <banttu> I have a couple of checkboxes, I need to fetch text wrapped around a <span> on the text box label. Currently trying this :>  $('input:checkbox').each(function(){
[21:08:45] <banttu> 146                                          //lsz = $(this).val();
[21:08:46] <banttu> 147                                          aa = $(this).find('span').val();
[21:09:11] <Eviltwin> Finding a span inside a checkbox?
[21:09:26] <banttu> yeah
[21:09:32] <shoky> pasting a code inside a channel?
[21:09:33] <Eviltwin> How does that work?
[21:10:48] <Whirl3d> So, Eviltwin, now I see where you get your name... lol
[21:11:05] <shoky> you met his brother?
[21:11:57] <Whirl3d> no, it's just plain evil that I have been working on this same thing for the last week and in 22 keypresses, Evilltwin is able to undo everything that i have done...
[21:12:12] <Whirl3d> sold his soul to the devil, I am certain...
[21:12:19] <Whirl3d> 8)
[21:12:25] <shoky> well you've been told the same thing by a few other people ;p
[21:12:33] <banttu> I have check boxes generated by php, and there is text on the check box that I'm trying to fetch. So I'm looping over the txt boxes with each
[21:12:43] <Eviltwin> Google "jQuery pubsub"
[21:12:58] <banttu> Ok Danke
[21:13:22] <shoky> LoL
[21:13:29] <Whirl3d> sure. I have...dozens of times
[21:13:40] <Eviltwin> It's the first hit for me
[21:13:42] <Whirl3d> Still, it's not exactly what I want, but it's a neat approach
[21:14:00] <Eviltwin> You said pubsub in the context of jQuery
[21:14:03] <Eviltwin> That's all I knew
[21:14:37] <howardgrigg> how do I set the height of a div based on the width of it? and have it update if the div width changes?
[21:14:45] <Eviltwin> banttu: Can you show the HTML markup?
[21:15:03] <Whirl3d> I was joking, for sure. I appreciate the link. I think that ben Alman's blog was the impetus for my exploration anyways.
[21:16:02] <Whirl3d> the $.Callbacks() object provides relatively the same functionality...
[21:16:43] <Eviltwin> How so?
[21:17:07] <banttu> Eviltwin: hang on
[21:20:03] <banttu> Eviltwin: <input type="checkbox" name="listID[]" value="<?php echo $listID; ?>" id="selectid<?php echo $listID; ?>" ><?php echo "<code><b>".$listName."</b> [<    span id=listsize".$listID.">".$listSize."</span>"; if ($clientType==1){ echo " Number(s)]</code>";}else{echo " Subscriber(s)]</code>";} ?><br />       <?php } ?></input><id='target' value='<?ph    p echo htmlentities($listID) ?>' />
[21:20:19] <shoky> ouchie
[21:20:28] <Eviltwin> banttu: Use pastebin or pastie or jsFiddle or someting
[21:21:51] <Eviltwin> banttu: Also, the PHP is irrelevant and useless to us
[21:21:58] <Eviltwin> Please show an HTML snippet
[21:22:03] <Eviltwin> Use "View Source" if necessary
[21:22:17] <Eviltwin> And give us a sample
[21:22:24] <Eviltwin> Again, using a paste tool like the ones I mentioned above
[21:23:06] <Whirl3d> can you explain in English what is going on with o=$({}); $.subscribe=function () { o.on.apply(o, arguments}     ?
[21:24:19] <Whirl3d> o is a jquery wrapped object, $.subscribe defines a jquery method where the object listens to itself...lost
[21:24:20] <banttu> Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/TMrxG55q
[21:25:12] <Eviltwin> banttu: Did you catch that thing I said about PHP vs HTML
[21:26:32] <banttu> I'd done it before it saw  it. Repasting

[21:29:46] <Eviltwin> banttu: Okay, so input tags do not contain other elements
[21:29:52] <Eviltwin> http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#h-17.4
[21:30:23] <Eviltwin> So you can't use .find() because .find() only looks at descendents onf the tag
[21:30:26] <Eviltwin> And thre are none
[21:31:17] <banttu> Ok. Thanks. Regex then?
[21:31:17] <Eviltwin> You may want to see ?.next
[21:31:33] <Forbidd3n> Anyone here work with bgstretcher?
[21:31:34] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/next
[21:31:44] <Eviltwin> To find the following element
[21:32:26] <danzik171> Whirl3d: it's just a thin facade over the jQuery event methods that translates to more pub-sub like terms.  but it's a good idea to use a facade anyway, that way you're not tied to your implementation, just your interface.
[21:32:43] <Forbidd3n> Eviltwin: ever using bgstretcher?
[21:32:45] <banttu> Ok.
[21:32:51] <Eviltwin> Forbidd3n: No
[21:33:17] <Whirl3d> danzik171, I've been using $.Callbacks() and it's really great. Thanks for telling me about it.
[21:33:35] <Forbidd3n> any other technique you use to expand and contract a bg image with css/jquery?
[21:34:04] <Eviltwin> Forbidd3n: It's probably not hard to do listening to some events and/or using .css
[21:34:19] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: What's the problem you're trying to solve?
[21:35:02] <AlecTaylor> What is the sequence for authentication on a decoupled [i.e.: javascript] client? - http://programmers.stackexchange.com/q/153106
[21:37:00] <Whirl3d> not so much a problem...really just exploring the pub sub concept. I was hoping to write a plugin method whose functionality could be overridden to implement two different behaviors...one being a "publisher of events and one being a delegated publisher of events...
[21:39:08] <Whirl3d> I was trying to abstract the notion that would allow any element to be a publisher, accepting subscribers forcustom events and assigning the ability to fire those events to other elements that 'regsitered' with the main publisher source of the events...
[21:39:26] <Whirl3d> it would allow subscribers to subscribe to the events but not fire them.
[21:39:28] <Eviltwin> AlecTaylor: This is super vague
[21:40:24] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Uh... okay
[21:41:00] <Eviltwin> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishâsubscribe_pattern
[21:41:35] <marandi> hi guys , i use jquery tap but when tab goes bigger than screen resolution , it didnt scroll , what should i do about it ?
[21:41:40] <Eviltwin> "subscribers express interest in one or more classes, and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of what, if any, publishers there are"
[21:41:42] <Whirl3d> I'm still having a hard time understanding when to assign methods using prototype and when to use an object literal...(I may have the terms wrong, buthopefully it conveys the confusion)
[21:43:02] <Eviltwin> Traditional pubsub uses a singleton
[21:43:20] <Eviltwin> One central arbiter of events
[21:43:24] <Eviltwin> or messages in this case
[21:43:28] <danzik171> Whirl3d: here's a starting point:  http://jsfiddle.net/mUUJp/
[21:44:29] <Whirl3d> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff649664.aspx Eviltwin, here are the three types of pubsubs I was looking at. Specifically the list-based pub sub
[21:44:33] <danzik171> that's similar to the real one that use, but lacking some features that you can implement if you want like optional namespaced events w/ the installTo method
[21:44:38] <Eviltwin> I like that you're using essentially cowboy's tiny pubsub
[21:44:50] <Eviltwin> Using jQuery's event system
[21:45:02] <Eviltwin> And still using getElementById and innerHTML
[21:45:12] <danzik171> eh, i got lazy.
[21:45:18] <Eviltwin> More chars = lazy?
[21:45:32] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Never turn to Microsoft for good practices
[21:45:33] <danzik171> eh, /shrug
[21:45:44] <AlecTaylor> xD
[21:46:05] <danzik171> like i said, my real implementation has additional functionality that i wanted.  but yes, this is essentially his tiny pubsub implementation at the base
[21:46:29] <Whirl3d> i dont' really care so much if they are good practices, I was showing you the first model of a list-based pubsub like I am working on.
[21:46:58] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: That list stuff is happening under the covers inside the $({})
[21:47:12] <Eviltwin> jQuery's event model works that way
[21:48:38] <Whirl3d> which I plan to make ample us of. I'm not trying to replace jquery's event model, I just want a way that I can have one object "announce" it's shit and several objects listen to it
[21:49:06] <Whirl3d> I want the listeners to know what they want to listen to, but the publisher not to know who is listening
[21:49:18] <shoky> [07:23:06] <Whirl3d> can you explain in English what is going on with o=$({}); $.subscribe=function () { o.on.apply(o, arguments}     ?
[21:49:18] <shoky> [07:24:18] <Whirl3d> o is a jquery wrapped object, $.subscribe defines a jquery method where the object listens to itself...lost
[21:49:42] <Whirl3d> and I want the publisher to be able grant rights to some objects to fire the published events
[21:49:45] <shoky> Whirl3d:  o.on.apply(o, arguments)   is just a call to o.on(arguments)
[21:50:20] <Whirl3d> so arguments would then be: ...
[21:50:40] <shoky> $.subscribe('myEvent', callback)
[21:50:50] <shoky> arguments would be those 2 arguments
[21:50:59] <Whirl3d> and it's okay to use a global, empty object to do that?
[21:51:03] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/4ebsM/
[21:51:46] <shoky> Whirl3d yes. when you use $(element).on  then the events data is written into the element object itself
[21:52:01] <shoky> er i mean when you do $(selector).on
[21:52:14] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, my first draft which I am rewriting: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/gGZU9/14/
[21:52:29] <shoky> when you do $( regularObject ).on ,  the events data is just written to the object itself
[21:52:43] <shoky> that's why $().on wouldn't work
[21:52:51] <shoky> because there's no object to attach the events data to
[21:53:02] <Eviltwin> Or if you don't want them to be able to find out what's in the list no matter how hard they try: http://jsfiddle.net/dMthb/
[21:53:46] <Eviltwin> I don't usually see pubsub done per-instance like this
[21:54:00] <Eviltwin> This seems like almost exactly jQuery events per-DOM-node
[21:54:50] <Whirl3d> I am using the $.Callbacks object o leverage .add and .remove and .fire
[21:55:52] <Whirl3d> and for elements that "publish" their list of events, they store an array of those callbacks--one for each "published" method
[21:56:27] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/aJTAC/
[21:58:24] <Whirl3d> that's beautiful, but how is it implemented?
[21:58:43] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[21:58:47] <shoky> +1
[21:58:52] <Whirl3d> I see what it does and how it does it...which is genius in itself, but how do I apply that to a gallery for example.
[21:58:54] <Eviltwin> It's self-documenting code :P
[22:00:41] <banttu> Eviltwin: Thanks again
[22:04:26] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Here's a per-element pubsub: http://jsfiddle.net/Dh75v/
[22:06:13] <shoky> +2
[22:09:44] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, there's no doubt that your deal with devil has produced a form of genius second to none...now by the time I understand it (not just how to use it), computers will likely have given way to the next technological fad..idduno biologic computing or something..
[22:10:33] <Eviltwin> Here's a more jQuery-abusing way: http://jsfiddle.net/54Xb4/
[22:10:57] <Whirl3d> like the entire getOrMake twist...how does one even get to a point to think about creating an intermediary function like that...if I understand it at all.
[22:10:59] <Eviltwin> Just pollute the data directly
[22:11:28] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: It's kind of like the singleton pattern's getInstance()
[22:11:45] <Eviltwin> Which is responsible for either returning the existing instance or creating one if it doesn't exist
[22:11:54] <Eviltwin> (and saving it and returning that)
[22:12:21] <Whirl3d> do you know how many unnecessary lines of code this little morsel will save me: this.data(key, data = $.Callbacks());
[22:12:42] <Eviltwin> 2?
[22:12:48] <shoky> ;]
[22:12:59] <Whirl3d> I didn't know you could assign a varialble's value in the value part an assignment like that
[22:13:09] <Whirl3d> 2*10000 per day.
[22:13:11] <Whirl3d> lol
[22:13:12] <shoky> an assignment has a return value
[22:13:16] <Eviltwin> Yeah (a = b) evaultes to the value of b
[22:13:27] <Eviltwin> Whil also assigning that value to a
[22:13:32] <Whirl3d> sure, it's easy to see now. But before now, I've never seen it.
[22:13:44] <Eviltwin> It's an expression rather than a statement
[22:14:05] <shoky> i do it all the time in C
[22:14:08] <Eviltwin> Meaning it has a value and can be used wherever expressions are valid
[22:14:12] <shoky> /C++
[22:14:22] <Eviltwin> Another evil one is the comma operator
[22:14:23] <Whirl3d> just like your weird (but amazing) branching methods...  key && _cbs[key]||...wow
[22:14:51] <Eviltwin> (a, b) evalutes to b
[22:15:11] <Eviltwin> While executing both a and b if they're expressions
[22:15:34] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, why don't you write a damned book of evil tricks like that.
[22:15:37] <Whirl3d> I would buy it.
[22:15:41] <Whirl3d> will buy it
[22:15:47] <Eviltwin> Too busy
[22:15:51] <Whirl3d> if you write it, hell, I'll publish the shit
[22:16:09] <Whirl3d> I sure as hell hope you are rich...
[22:16:18] <Eviltwin> Not yet
[22:16:24] <Eviltwin> but hopefully some day
[22:16:27] <Whirl3d> close?
[22:16:33] <Eviltwin> Not really
[22:16:36] <Whirl3d> you're still a youngster, though, right?
[22:16:41] <Eviltwin> Correct
[22:17:29] <Whirl3d> Why aren't you writing an iphone app. So many people have become millionaires in no time at all..I got a handful of apps that could make you rich in a heartbeat.
[22:17:33] <Whirl3d> if you weren't busy
[22:17:39] <Eviltwin> I don't really like Objective C
[22:17:45] <shoky> hm
[22:17:59] <shoky> Whirl3d I am ok with obj C, wanna gimme apps? :)
[22:18:29] <shoky> the ones you don't save for Eviltwin of course
[22:18:40] <Whirl3d> shoky, gladly. I am completely serious about at least 5 apps that if you will do the coding, I'll do the design and interface and I swear we will be rich within a year
[22:19:03] <shoky> i'd be glad to have that talk ;)
[22:20:52] <Whirl3d> Right now, I turn down requests at least once a week for lawyers who have to do presentations in court and are being weighed down by the need for that "csi effect" to woo the jury.
[22:21:25] <shoky> you're a provider of csi effects?
[22:21:55] <Whirl3d> I slap together a keynote or powerpoint presentation with a couple of clips from famous movies and some tasty graphics and every time they freak out. I don't think I have ever had a presentation that the attorney didn't win
[22:22:08] <shoky> hah
[22:22:56] <shoky> so, what's your reputation
[22:23:06] <Whirl3d> and when I told one guy that he'd have to pay me 10,000 to do his defense case for this guy who beat his children half to death...I couldn't even finish the sentence and he had a 10,000 check written and a couple thousand in cash to hand me.
[22:23:38] <shoky> WtF
[22:24:25] <shoky> can you design my future
[22:25:28] <Whirl3d> Sure. I can make it look pretty. But you gotta provide the code...lol
[22:25:45] <shoky> ;D
[22:26:00] <shoky> you got an online portfolio i can drool at?
[22:26:09] <Whirl3d> Ill tell you the biggest project that I would kill to create is a way to implement tablet-based pallets
[22:26:43] <shoky> hm
[22:26:45] <Whirl3d> I'd like to be able to get all my damned tools off the screen onto my pad so I could switch tools/settings with my fingers without having to move them around
[22:26:57] <AlecTaylor> What is the sequence for authentication on a decoupled [i.e.: javascript] client? - http://programmers.stackexchange.com/q/153106
[22:27:13] <Eviltwin> AlecTaylor: Make your question less ambiguous
[22:27:20] <shoky> Whirl3d sounds good :)
[22:27:38] <AlecTaylor> Eviltwin: Looking for a sequence diagram describing how authentication works on a decoupled client :)
[22:27:50] <Whirl3d> I have tried to use iDisplay for it, but it steals focus from the app...it doesn't quite work yet.
[22:28:10] <Eviltwin> AlecTaylor: That's more ambiguous
[22:28:19] <AlecTaylor> >.<
[22:28:27] <AlecTaylor> Using a sequence diagram and example code could you explain to me how authentication works when the client is completely separated from the server?
[22:28:27] <Eviltwin> Try adding specifics
[22:29:22] <Whirl3d> Still, I gotta run to my bosses house to pick up his dog...he's giving a presentation on a cruise around Alaska...I'll be back on in just a while if you wanna talk some more about some projects.. EvilTwin, Shoky,danzik171, thanks for the information and instruction. I'll be back shortly.
[22:30:47] <AlecTaylor> Eviltwin: Previously I was generating client-side using a template-engine server-side. This was great because I could just add if(auth){} checks. However with the client-side being written from scratch (using js libraries), I'm unsure how to authenticate and perform my usual RBAC.
[22:32:21] <Eviltwin> AlecTaylor: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/OpenIDvs.Pseudo-AuthenticationusingOAuth.svg
[22:32:24] <Eviltwin> There
[22:32:34] <shoky> Whirl3d np, i'm gonna sleep soon so prolly talk to you tomorrow
[22:33:24] <AlecTaylor> Eviltwin: Thanks, can you also give me a code example?
[22:33:39] <shoky> Eviltwin, may i inquire: how old areyou? and whereabouts?
[22:34:03] <Eviltwin> shoky: Early 20s
[22:34:28] <Eviltwin> From Chicago, spending most of my time in California these days
[22:35:00] <shoky> cool. thanx ;)
[22:35:08] <Eviltwin> AlecTaylor: Poke through here: http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/javascript/
[22:38:29] <JonYoder> Hey! I'm having trouble getting each image to be selected individually in my script: http://jsfiddle.net/rH7wk/
[22:38:50] <macmartine> This isn't exactly jquery specific, but I'm looking for ways to dynamically create buttons -- where the user chooses the text, colors, etc through form objects and sees the result render in the page. Are there any plugings or anything to help with this?
[22:38:59] <JonYoder> What I'm trying to do is replace a smaller version of the image with the original image that is linked.
[22:39:05] <Eviltwin> AlecTaylor: Or here: http://oauth.net/code/
[22:41:53] <javalover> ok google is starting to piss me off
[22:42:05] <macmartine> that sucks
[22:42:16] <javalover> lets say I have this <div id = "a"><div id = "innerdiv"></div></div>
[22:42:32] <javalover> and I want to go $("#innerdiv").find("#a");
[22:42:40] <Forbidd3n> you can't do that
[22:42:43] <javalover> so I want to go from inner div & find the parent id with A
[22:42:48] <javalover> yeah I know so what am I supposed to do instead?
[22:42:51] <Forbidd3n> that is looking inside of innerdiv
[22:42:56] <Forbidd3n> a is outside of it
[22:42:57] <macmartine> ancestor
[22:43:01] <javalover> well yeah it is
[22:43:08] <javalover> so what am I supposed to do..which one is most like .find
[22:43:13] <javalover> but instead it's find outer or something?
[22:43:18] <Forbidd3n> you can do $("#innerdiv").parent('a');
[22:43:23] <javalover> oh that works?
[22:43:23] <Forbidd3n> or jsut parent actually
[22:43:29] <macmartine> just parent
[22:43:34] <javalover> but I want it to be the parent div with A
[22:43:38] <javalover> if it doesn't have id a I don't want it
[22:43:51] <javalover> i have like more than 1 div as a parent
[22:44:04] <macmartine> no, you only have one parent
[22:44:07] <Forbidd3n> it will always be the immediate parent
[22:44:14] <javalover> oh...
[22:44:14] <Forbidd3n> not the parent of parent
[22:44:23] <javalover> well how can I search for the div that has A
[22:44:54] <Eviltwin> You want .closest()
[22:45:03] <javalover> can closest ever fail?
[22:45:08] <Eviltwin> api.jquery.com/closest
[22:45:15] <Eviltwin> Uh
[22:45:15] <javalover> i looked at closest
[22:45:21] <Eviltwin> What do you mean "ever fail"?
[22:45:22] <javalover> but i want to make sure it works properly and i'm doing it right is all
[22:45:25] <javalover> like say I have this
[22:45:41] <macmartine> there;s only one parent. do you want  the parent only if it's an a tag, or do you want the closest ancestor a tag?
[22:45:43] <javalover> <div id = "a"><div id = "innerdiv"></div><div id = "a></div></div>
[22:45:48] <javalover> who will it go 2 on closest?
[22:46:04] <javalover> I want the first A always
[22:46:11] <javalover> so the one that holds inner div inside it
[22:46:32] <Eviltwin> .closest only traverses the ancestry
[22:46:39] <javalover> so it goes up?
[22:46:44] <javalover> so you use closest for up & find for down?
[22:46:45] <Eviltwin> Up the tree, yes
[22:46:46] <javalover> basically?
[22:46:49] <Eviltwin> Yes
[22:46:50] <macmartine> .closest('a')
[22:46:52] <javalover> awww ic so ur right no matter what
[22:46:53] <javalover> awesome!
[22:47:00] <javalover> thx guys!!! woot eviltwin again

[22:50:02] <program> used similar code to validate in a form it is working
[22:50:28] <program> but when i call it using load()  it is not working
[22:50:43] <macmartine> program: see what's not "similar"
[22:51:32] <program> http://jsfiddle.net/sudhannsu/xXhs9/ see the code
[22:52:55] <program> when  i load this page into another page div it is not working
[22:53:25] <Eviltwin> program: Learn to put the code in the right boxes
[22:53:33] <macmartine> program: how does a div not work?
[22:54:51] <AlecTaylor> Eviltwin: Yes, I'm fine to work with Facebook when the templates are being generated server-side, just confused at what to do when it all needs to be done client-side in js
[22:56:11] <Eviltwin> AlecTaylor: The user actually gets redirected back and forth: http://www.formatix.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/diagram-oauth-handshake.png
[22:58:01] <AlecTaylor> and from where is the "conversation" initiated to my server, from the facebook app or from the client?
[22:58:26] <Eviltwin> You begin at the client
[22:58:34] <Eviltwin> And the client wants credentials
[22:58:49] <Eviltwin> You bounce them to a Facebook URL
[22:59:00] <Eviltwin> That contains the return URL
[22:59:04] <Eviltwin> A URL on your site
[22:59:12] <Eviltwin> Once they have autenticated
[22:59:23] <Eviltwin> They bounce back to that URL with the auth token
[22:59:58] <AlecTaylor> Client->[Load my website]; Client->[Clicks "Login with Facebook"]; "Login with Facebook"->[Facebook]; [Facebook]->Client; Client->[Sends facebook token stuff to my Server];
[23:00:00] <AlecTaylor> ^So like that?
[23:00:24] <AlecTaylor> Oh, right
[23:00:33] <AlecTaylor> So it's sort of one step
[23:00:42] <AlecTaylor> This: [Facebook]->Client; Client->[Sends facebook token stuff to my Server];
[23:01:20] <Eviltwin> Well Facebook needs to know who it's authenticating for
[23:01:57] <Eviltwin> So typically you direct them from your site to a URL on Facebok that identifies your app
[23:01:59] <AlecTaylor> Yeah, but that all happens at the "Login with Facebook"->[Facebook] stage
[23:02:06] <Eviltwin> Yes
[23:02:15] <AlecTaylor> Great, I think I understand now :)
[23:02:34] <Eviltwin> The goal is to prevent you from being able to capture their password wtc
[23:02:35] <Eviltwin> etc8
[23:02:38] <Eviltwin> etc*
[23:02:40] <Eviltwin> (Grr)
[23:02:47] <AlecTaylor> :p
[23:20:53] <cdaringe> goodevening all. i was hoping someone may be willing to help me determine why my autocomplete is not returning json data in a usable fashion
[23:34:44] <shoky> cdaringe: pastebin the relevant code/json
[23:35:00] <shoky> dont ask to ask
[23:35:12] <cdaringe> hi shoky: is ubuntu forums acceptable? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=12030837#post12030837
[23:35:24] <cdaringe> otherwise i'll PB
[23:36:10] <shoky> cdaringe its fine, but also pb your php's output, the json itself
[23:38:43] <cdaringe> shoky: openly, beyond the source or echoing/var_dumping/etc, i'm not sure how to extract the json that i'm hopin is being gen'd as i enter.  is this what you are requesting?
[23:40:57] <shoky> look in your browser's/firebug network tab
[23:41:05] <shoky> for the php request
[23:41:26] <shoky> or just go to the php itself in your browser with some term param
[23:43:21] <cdaringe> shoky: interesting. in my network tab as i enter data it's rendering a 404 not found for my $_GET
[23:44:50] <cdaringe> oops, that's because i had a typo. let's see here..
[23:44:55] <tw2113> ajax/json stuff shoky ?
[23:45:29] <cdaringe> http://pastebin.com/HQeh4niY is the output of the error in the network tab
[23:50:13] <cdaringe> interesting.  so, I connect to the dB before i ask search.php to query, yet it gives me authentication errors.  yet, if i do a include(search.php); and have it print my json, it queries no problem.
[23:51:44] <shoky> tw2113 who wha?
[23:53:43] <tw2113> only time php is usually discussed in here is ajax stuff
[23:54:20] <shoky> sorry i am justr about to fall asleep, wat are you saying ;p
[23:55:19] <cdaringe> well thanks  Shoky.  ill go chat with the PHP crew as i now see it's a php issue
