[00:00:08] <nauthiz> hi all, if I create an empty object using var o = {}; and then fill it with some properties o.bla = 1; o.bli = 2; and so on, how can I find out, how many properties are set? is there smth similar to .length?
[00:00:19] <Matth1a3> can someone please help me with this problem i posted on stackxchange: http://bit.ly/iE7aZy
[00:00:30] <Matth1a3> it's about Jquery not working in IE8
[00:04:46] <systemfault> nauthiz: No, you must count manually.
[00:04:50] <shesek> Matth1a3, no, its about a 3rd party library not working in IE8
[00:05:22] <systemfault> nauthiz: for/in + hasOwnProperty + some counter :/
[00:05:45] <nauthiz> disgusting -.-
[00:05:55] <Matth1a3> shesek: sorry, i thought it was because jquery wasn't being loaded
[00:06:12] <systemfault> nauthiz: Write a small function.. it won't be as disgusting.
[00:06:48] <nauthiz> yeah, but I want to keep the amount of loops as small as possible
[00:07:15] <shesek> Matth1a3, I don't have IE to test it, but it seems like the problem is with jDock, isn't it?
[00:08:46] <shesek> What error are you getting, exactly ?
[00:09:55] <Matth1a3> shesek: i don't think so - the script works in IE9, chrome, safari, FF - but not IE8
[00:10:16] <Matth1a3> shesek: and i'm new to jquery / javascript - no idea how to view errors
[00:10:33] <systemfault> Matth1a3: What is your browser?
[00:10:40] <Matth1a3> systemfault: chrome
[00:10:50] <systemfault> Then ctrl+shift+j
[00:10:54] <shesek> well, jQuery was tested to work on IE8, and from my experience it does
[00:11:02] <systemfault> (Or command+option+j for mac)
[00:11:29] <shesek> Its much more reasonable for the problem to be with either jDock or in the way you're using it rather than with jQuery in general
[00:11:43] <systemfault> Matth1a3: You should see the dev tools..Then click on the console and reload the page
[00:11:46] <shesek> Matth1a3, open IE's developer tools and see if you get any errors
[00:11:46] <systemfault> Check for errors
[00:15:53] <Matth1a3> all it says is SEC7115: :visited and :link styles can only differ by color. Some styles were not applied to :visited.
[00:21:54] <Matth1a3> in chrome there are no errors
[00:30:02] <djQuery> sk8ball: something like this could build the object for you. http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/zPTKK/3/

[01:46:51] <nVee> hey there. If want I a function to run in each input field in a form, is there a way to do it, like running an for loop for each form element in jquery?

[01:51:43] <coldhead> i don't think html() supports a callback
[01:51:49] <coldhead> and you don't need one anyway
[01:51:56] <coldhead> it's not asynchronous
[01:52:28] <SimpleAnecdote> coldhead: hang on, I'll paste the whole thing ;P - my bad

[01:53:19] <coldhead> for those following along at hoe i am making mashed potatos while listening to alasnoaxis's houseplant
[01:53:22] <coldhead> home*
[01:54:24] <dr0id> are you a good cook ?
[01:54:31] <macheleon> I hope you're making proper ones, with a sieve
[01:54:40] <coldhead> terrible
[01:54:51] <coldhead> i hate cooking
[01:55:12] <coldhead> i am only good at liquidy things
[01:55:20] <macheleon> I love cooking. I just don't do it since the mother in law commandeered my kitchen
[01:55:21] <coldhead> porridge or mash or curry or chili
[01:55:32] <coldhead> can M-I-L cook?
[01:55:55] <macheleon> meh, edible
[01:56:05] <macheleon> nothing special
[01:56:21] <coldhead> maybe you should change spouse
[01:56:26] <coldhead> :D
[01:56:38] <SimpleAnecdote> coldhead: Look for - alternateStyles("required"); - I may be approaching this whole thing wrong, kind of my first JS..
[01:56:38] <macheleon> aw, but she's so good at

[01:57:20] <macheleon> also, MIL is exceptionally talented at damaging my car in ways that I would have to try very hard to imitate
[01:57:43] <coldhead> hahaha
[01:57:51] <coldhead> car damage as performance art?
[01:57:51] <coldhead> <3
[01:58:02] <macheleon> winner
[01:58:25] <coldhead> SimpleAnecdote: there's nothing here about a callback for html()
[01:58:29] <coldhead> and i don't know why you need it
[01:58:55] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/dH5CR/4/
[01:59:05] <coldhead> you have it withouth the callback in the next block
[01:59:11] <coldhead> Y U SO CALLBACK!
[01:59:39] <SimpleAnecdote> coldhead: I know, but it fucks up on my server. So I'm trying to change it to a callback.
[01:59:59] <SimpleAnecdote> once again, I may be showing my newbishness
[02:00:12] <SimpleAnecdote> but a callback is the first thing my google search landed on
[02:00:45] <coldhead> u can only provide callbacks to functions that support them
[02:01:02] <coldhead> animations are a good example
[02:01:11] <dr0id> MIL ?
[02:01:15] <coldhead> you give it some code to run later
[02:01:21] <coldhead> like when the animation has finished
[02:01:31] <coldhead> but html() updates immediately, so there's no use for a callback
[02:01:39] <coldhead> how does it "fuck up", SimpleAnecdote ?
[02:01:46] <coldhead> dr0id: mother-in-law
[02:02:16] <SimpleAnecdote> coldhead: the ajax response updates after deleteting characters from the input field
[02:02:32] <coldhead> ah okay
[02:02:34] <dr0id> aah
[02:02:37] <coldhead> ajax() takes a callback
[02:03:02] <SimpleAnecdote> hmm..
[02:03:10] <coldhead> you're using it already
[02:03:18] <coldhead> the function you call success:
[02:04:29] <SimpleAnecdote> coldhead: ok, thanks. I'm going to try and fit the big IF() inside the ajax() call so I can use that callback. I will most likely beg for help momentarily ;P
[02:04:40] <coldhead> wait... does alternateStyle call itself?
[02:05:08] <SimpleAnecdote> how do you mean?
[02:05:20] <Arnjeir>  I have a problem, I use some jQuery to toggle content. with several buttons controlling each their content. BUT I am trying to make it so when one of the contents are toggled and you try toggle a different content the first one should be toggled off before the new one opens.
[02:05:27] <Arnjeir> I have done this: http://pastebin.com/at8LA8CU and it works 1 time, but the next time it just try to close the content respective of the button I press.
[02:06:03] <Arnjeir> so lets say I press on button 1, content 1 shows up fine. then I press on button 2 content 1 dissapear and content 2 appears. but if I then press on button 1 again it runs the "closing" part of content 1
[02:06:18] <coldhead> alternativeStyles = function() { blah blah blah; $.ajax({blah blah blah success: function blah blah blah; alternativeStyles(); } ) }
[02:07:14] <coldhead> SimpleAnecdote: with a function as big as the one you are providing to success here it would be a lot more readable to declare it elsewhere with a name and then provide that name to ajax rather than try to inline it anonymously
[02:07:49] <coldhead> so $.ajax({blah blah; success: magicSuccessFun; })
[02:08:04] <coldhead> i gotta mash this potato, good luck
[02:08:31] <coldhead> seutje: sigh <333
[02:08:48] <seutje> coldhead: WAT?
[02:09:31] <SimpleAnecdote> coldhead: I know you're right. I fear I have fallen into that trap of "trying to make it work and tidying up later" and now I may be lost a little. Thanks for the tips. Good luck with the potatos.
[02:13:12] <finite> Is anybody successfully using Fancybox 1.3.4 with the jquery 1.6.1? Only works for me when loading iframes, else "permission denied" errors ... seems o be doing some crazy unnecessary Ajax shit.

[02:17:04] <dacmo> Hello
[02:17:12] <coldhead> seutje: i love you, man
[02:17:17] <dacmo> I have a noobie question
[02:17:18] <Taftse|Work> how would i go about testing if a table has no rows ?
[02:18:41] <finite> Taftse|Work: $('tr', table).length?
[02:20:01] <Taftse|Work> thanks
[02:20:34] <Arnjeir> nobody? here is a live test http://promotion.collectmedia.net/testcard.php (buttons on the top right of the box are the ones that toggle the content)
[02:20:43] <dacmo> I've defined a var myvar to be a JQ object, now I'm trying to use $('#myselector',myvar).css() method to manipulate that var before attaching it to the dom, but it's not working. Is $('#myselector',myvar) a valid approach?
[02:22:30] <finite> dacmo: Yes that should change the css of the #myselector which is contained within your myvar object. Time for some console.logs I reckon.
[02:23:25] <dacmo> finite: Thanks. At least I know I'm on the right track. Cheers :-)
[02:27:38] <Arnjeir> how do I pause the script untill an animation is done?
[02:29:01] <finite> Arnjeir: I think youve just got to pass a callback to the animation to perform the stuff that must wait until completion. Or does queueing help here?
[02:31:45] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/B8zhr/
[02:31:54] <thomedy> okay your turn...
[02:32:01] <thomedy> i have done an animate function before
[02:32:15] <thomedy> but whenever i do it and then dont for a while . icant do it again
[02:32:19] <thomedy> i don't know why
[02:33:28] <Aamir> thomedy:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/B8zhr/1/
[02:35:08] <thomedy> thank you whats the dif between what you did and me... it looks the same...
[02:35:25] <Aamir> thomedy: left applies to position absolute
[02:35:53] <thomedy> i guess that makes sense thank you.
[02:35:57] <thomedy> i should have thought of that
[02:36:10] <thomedy> okay my ultimate goal is to create a div that scrolls
[02:36:43] <thomedy> through content based on animate({scrollTop: 'e.layerY'});
[02:36:52] <fkefer> Hi all!
[02:37:03] <thomedy> that didn't work either let me build it and then ill ask for help and pre thank you
[02:37:08] <finite> thomedy: Also you were missing an open brace after function()
[02:37:18] <gnarf> hey bitches
[02:37:20] <marktuk> can anyone take a look at a piece of code for me in firefox? http://jsfiddle.net/JhxKM/14/
[02:37:44] <fkefer> is there a way to load the binary content of a PDF file from another server into a (string-)variable in my browser?
[02:37:45] <marktuk> adjust the preview pane so that it scrolls, and try to scroll the sidebar out of the container
[02:38:06] <marktuk> thr script should catch it, but it doesn't, an error occurs which i can't work out :(
[02:38:33] <thomedy> yeah i saw that
[02:38:47] <thomedy> actualli  think taht the position relative fixed my scroll function too cuz its working now
[02:38:56] <thomedy> okay i may have done it
[02:39:04] <thomedy> would position relative work that better
[02:39:07] <Aamir> thomedy: have fun http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/B8zhr/2/
[02:39:17] <Arnjeir> finite: this is not gonna help I don't think as the 2 actions that need to have a break between eachother is in 2 different functions
[02:39:33] <Arnjeir> (but I am a rookie so I could very well just not know how to do it :P)
[02:39:43] <marktuk> thomedy: how do you mean?
[02:40:07] <finite> Arnjeir: Youll need to google pause/delay then. There are (less than ideal) solutions.
[02:40:44] <JaredCE> hi all, one of our ex colleagues wrote a plugin for jquery, but i'm not sure it was wrote in the best way and i need to refactor it a bit.  Unfortunately this is the first time i've ever wrote a jquery plugin so i'm struggling with some of the concepts and ideas
[02:41:16] <Arnjeir> okey
[02:41:30] <thomedy> ha  ha ha ha i freakin did it
[02:41:31] <keir> can anyone please help me work out a way to stop the page from loading if it is accessed directly or would that require server-side stuff?
[02:41:32] <thomedy> bam...
[02:41:40] <Aamir> ?g jquery plugin patterns @JaredCE
[02:41:41] <thomedy> i was able to figure it out bymyslef.
[02:41:41] <bot-t> JaredCE, Winton Welsh has a blog - jQuery Plugin Patterns - http://wintoni.us/post/123029056/jquery-plugin-patterns
[02:41:42] <thomedy> yay
[02:42:42] <Zerxer> keir: yes, do server-side stuff. simplest way is, in the main file that will be including the other file, do define('BASE', '1'); and then in the file that cannot be accessed directly, you'd do: defined('BASE') or die('You cannot access this file directly.');
[02:42:45] <JaredCE> at the moment the plugin is initilized on the page and a setting is passed in like (hello:world), however i want to change it up so that i can initilize the plugin like thus but also so i can call individual functions from within the plugin
[02:42:47] <Zerxer> this is PHP btw
[02:43:00] <Zerxer> another option is to restrict by .htaccess file
[02:43:22] <Zerxer> can change 'BASE' to something else if you want, just an example
[02:44:59] <macheleon> hm Zerxer I've been looking for a different way to handle that as well
[02:45:06] <macheleon> but in php so not for this channel
[02:45:23] <Zerxer> :)
[02:45:39] <Zerxer> I don't hang out in the PHP channel, I don't feel I'm pro enough :(
[02:46:14] <macheleon> I've been just setting a var in the parent file and testing isset in the children files, then using header() to redirect to a message page if !isset
[02:46:34] <macheleon> nothing wrong with just hanging out, I idle and learn stuff
[02:46:35] <keir> I come here because im not pro enough at jQuery - scraping knowledge off you pros :P
[02:46:40] <Zerxer> that works too. define() at least helps more in case of scoping issues
[02:47:01] <keir> however I am completely and utterly unpro at php :(
[02:47:12] <macheleon> my problem is that header() only works if nothing has been output by the browser before then
[02:47:39] <Zerxer> for my sites, I always store everything in an output buffer, until I'm completely ready to print it all out. that way any header settings along the way work just fine
[02:47:57] <macheleon> I don't even know how to do that lol
[02:47:59] <Zerxer> ob_start();  and then $content = ob_get_clean(); print $content
[02:48:38] <macheleon> ohey, there's something new
[02:48:48] <Zerxer> very handy
[02:49:17] <macheleon> damn, so using header wouldn't be any problem
[02:49:33] <macheleon> see the php channel doesn't know all
[02:49:39] <macheleon> I asked about that there
[02:50:22] <macheleon> looks like ob_end_flush() works too
[02:50:24] <Zerxer> depending how much content you're printing out along the way, the output buffer could be holding a lot. which could use up more memory, I'm not even sure. but I've yet to have any issues at all with it
[02:50:25] <BlaDe^> if in firebug I see: jQuery16107371649403284246 line 33, click click()
[02:50:30] <BlaDe^> how can I find the code which handles it
[02:50:46] <Zerxer> yea it does, ob_get_clean() is just a good way if you want to store it in a variable for whatever reason
[02:50:58] <BlaDe^> I have an issue where two alerts are showing, so a .click is being triggered twice.. chrome is showing a a.click and a document.click, but if I try open the document one it crashes, there shouldn't be a $(document).click() so it may be a bug...

[02:57:14] <BlaDe^> gnarf, you know in the right panel it shows "event listeners" ?
[02:57:19] <Zerxer> now that's pro
[02:58:04] <BlaDe^> gnarf, it shows two... "a" and "document"   (afaik, document shouldn't be there.. can't find it in the code.. even with a grep), when I click the drop down arrow on "document" I get the "Snap....." error, and the page crashes.
[02:58:15] <BlaDe^> but I believe these two bindings on the click event are what's showing my two confirm()'s

[02:58:55] <finite> Im using jquery to switch to tables for layout on ie7 like so http://pastie.org/2115395. This does something problematic. It converts hrefs from #anchor to http://.../#anchor. Any way to stop this conversion to full URLs?

[03:00:28] <gnarf> BlaDe^: no, in a debugger if you breakpoint on something
[03:00:32] <gnarf> you can type in console
[03:00:35] <gnarf> in local scope
[03:00:37] <finite> Hmm.

[03:01:41] <BlaDe^> gnarf, that's cool! how do I access the clickd element? $(this) doesn't seem to be the one I want
[03:01:50] <gnarf> BlaDe^: what is this ?
[03:02:02] <gnarf> BlaDe^: e.target ?
[03:02:11] <BlaDe^> $(document).find('a').first().data('events').click
[03:02:11] <BlaDe^> TypeError: Cannot call method 'find' of null
[03:02:23] <BlaDe^> e.target
[03:02:24] <BlaDe^> TypeError: Cannot read property 'target' of undefined
[03:02:35] <gnarf> are you breakpointed in an event handler?
[03:02:49] <BlaDe^> yeah, i clicked to break on all "click "events
[03:03:00] <gnarf> oh, you need to get to the actual click handler in your code
[03:03:04] <gnarf> the one popping the confirm()
[03:03:05] <egrouse> how can i access children of some query thats been saved to a variable
[03:03:10] <gnarf> breakpoint in there
[03:03:19] <gnarf> look at the stack traces
[03:03:20] <gnarf> etc
[03:03:25] <gnarf> local vars
[03:03:30] <gnarf> figure out why its getting called twice
[03:03:35] <egrouse> for example   var pic = jq('#portfolio-pics li' ); - how can i then get all img tags in pic[2] for example
[03:03:46] <BlaDe^> gnarf if i step until it shows the confirm I can't' access the console
[03:03:48] <egrouse> i tried pic[2].children('img') etc but that does not function
[03:03:51] <gnarf> pic.eq(2).find('img')
[03:03:59] <egrouse> thank you
[03:04:00] <gnarf> see ?eq
[03:04:01] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[03:04:09] <gnarf> it keeps it wrapped in jQuery
[03:04:20] <gnarf> [] returns the DOMElement
[03:04:25] <finite> gnarf: Know anything more about this IE7 prepending URLs to anchors? When does it happen? In html()?
[03:04:29] <egrouse> yeah, i thought something like that might be the case
[03:04:36] <gnarf> finite: on parsing of .href
[03:04:36] <egrouse> thanks for your help gnarf, appreciate i
[03:04:36] <egrouse> t
[03:04:44] <gnarf> finite: it can happen to plain ole html too
[03:05:29] <finite> gnarf: Thanks
[03:07:14] <BlaDe^> gnarf I have a hacky fix
[03:07:28] <BlaDe^> var result = confirm(); e.stopImmediatePropogation(); return result;

[03:57:06] <Ilie> hi, I have a xxx text in the page, I have a textbox where I enter a value, I want to replace xxx with that value, any idea what I can use ?
[03:59:56] <fabiobik> hello hello
[04:00:20] <fabiobik> i have 2 verifications
[04:00:37] <fabiobik>  if ($('#username').val().length == 0)
[04:00:53] <fabiobik>  if ($('#password').val().length == 0)
[04:01:07] <fabiobik> and i want to display the 2 errors at same time
[04:01:22] <fabiobik> but what happens is only password appears
[04:01:35] <Aquana> http://clutter.alexander-hesse.com/maze.html why is the submit handler not called?
[04:01:39] <fabiobik> but if i fill something in password the username appears
[04:02:05] <Me-Selfe> fabiobik: if thats the exact code, you check the password if the username is not set
[04:02:44] <fabiobik> Me-Selfe yes im testing if empty not filled
[04:03:15] <Me-Selfe> you want something like: if ($('#username').val().length == 0 && $('#password').val().length == 0) { some_error_handeling }
[04:03:19] <Me-Selfe> i guess
[04:03:44] <Me-Selfe> replace && with ||
[04:04:17] <fabiobik> Me-Selfe no
[04:04:38] <fabiobik> Me-selfe i want to display the two errors divs
[04:05:00] <Me-Selfe> you got one error div for username and one for password?
[04:05:27] <fabiobik> Me-Selfe yes
[04:05:28] <Me-Selfe> if ($('#username').val().length == 0) $('#username_error').show()
[04:05:48] <Me-Selfe> erm: if ($('#username').val().length == 0) { $('#username_error').show(); }
[04:05:51] <fabiobik> Me-Selfe i dont know but i think innerhtml function
[04:05:51] <Me-Selfe> and same for password
[04:06:16] <Me-Selfe> innerhtml function?
[04:06:17] <fabiobik> me-selfe
[04:06:18] <fabiobik> lol
[04:06:34] <Me-Selfe> i think you're making it harder then at it have to be :)
[04:06:35] <fabiobik> $("#errors").html('<div id="error">User cannot be empty</div>');
[04:07:05] <Me-Selfe> i just asked if you have two different divs...
[04:07:37] <Me-Selfe> something like:
[04:07:42] <Me-Selfe> $("#errors").html('');
[04:07:55] <fabiobik> Me-Selfe yes....   error will be displayed in #errors
[04:08:02] <slartsa> question: might I be able to view a source of a page where there are dynamically created and positioned elements?
[04:08:11] <Me-Selfe> if ( $('#username').val().length == 0 ) { $("#errors").append ('<div>some error</div>');
[04:08:41] <fabiobik> Me-selfe apend?
[04:09:01] <Me-Selfe> fabiobik: append... Add more to the #errors div
[04:09:11] <Me-Selfe> first remove the content of it, then append each error to it..
[04:10:39] <Me-Selfe> slartsa: you need something like firebug or chromes development tools to view the live dom tree
[04:11:34] <Me-Selfe> fabiobik: just remember to empty it first, else you get one error each time the user "fail"
[04:11:37] <Aquana> i just have $('#myformid').submit(function(){‚Ä¶ return false; });
[04:12:05] <Aquana> but when i submit the form the form gets actually submitted
[04:12:11] <Aquana> and the function is not called
[04:12:28] <slartsa> Me-Selfe: oh, dang
[04:12:33] <fabiobik> Me-Selfe can you see whats happen ? the append works fine thank you but now  see this
[04:12:42] <fabiobik> http://programais.com/labs/php/members/login.php
[04:12:53] <fabiobik> Me-Selfe click on submit buttom
[04:13:24] <Me-Selfe> fabiobik: you made that code?
[04:13:29] <Me-Selfe> or is it some library?
[04:13:38] <fabiobik> Me-Selfe what code
[04:13:57] <Me-Selfe> fabiobik: well, as i said.. clear the errors before you check username and password
[04:14:15] <Me-Selfe> $('#errors').html(''); <- that before the username/password check
[04:14:55] <Me-Selfe> second: all those errors got the same element id, which is doomed to fail.. If you want to do something with all, put them in a class and work on that instead
[04:15:32] <fabiobik> Me-Selfe yah
[04:15:46] <fabiobik> you liked the design
[04:16:14] <Me-Selfe> Its good i guess, depend on what you're using it for
[04:16:15] <fabiobik> ?
[04:16:48] <fabiobik> Me-Selfe its for sale
[04:16:55] <fabiobik> on codecaynon
[04:16:58] <Me-Selfe> okey
[04:17:18] <fabiobik> Me-Selfe member management script
[04:19:39] <Me-Selfe> fabiobik: well, the most important thing is that it works :)
[04:19:56] <fabiobik> yep
[04:19:58] <fabiobik> :)
[04:21:01] <nVee> does jQuery offer another solution to add items to an javascript array without having to specify the key?
[04:22:13] <Me-Selfe> nVee: javascript arrays got the push method? No need for jquery for that?
[04:22:38] <fabiobik> Me-Selfe http://programais.com/labs/php/members/login.php see now :)
[04:22:55] <Me-Selfe> fabiobik: nice :)

[04:29:28] <Me-Selfe> Aquana: that seem wrong :)
[04:29:40] <Aquana> why?
[04:30:01] <Me-Selfe> Aquana: i mean that the form is submitted even tho you return false :)
[04:30:08] <Me-Selfe> Got a complete sample?
[04:30:11] <Aquana> http://clutter.alexander-hesse.com/maze.html
[04:30:15] <Aquana> very simple
[04:32:03] <Me-Selfe> Aquana: Okey.. The element doesn't exist at the time you run the javascript...
[04:32:25] <Aquana> how can i solve it?
[04:32:41] <Me-Selfe> place your code inside: $(document).ready( function() { your_sumit_code_here });
[04:34:18] <Aquana> still nothing happens
[04:34:43] <WebGear> ok guys i am using the scrollTO plugin and would like a fall-back strategy for browsers/devices with JS disable
[04:34:50] <WebGear> here is how my current link look like

[04:34:52] <WebGear> <li><a href="javascript:;" onclick="$.scrollTo('#summer', 1000);">Enjoy The Summer With us</a></li>
[04:34:54] <Aquana> now it works

[04:53:51] <BlackAnt> Sup guys
[04:55:24] <BlackAnt> I have a page with multiple click events to slide the clicked element either (slideUp or slideDown ), But when I clicked the elements more than twice, it does not obey the law of jQuery
[04:55:28] <BlackAnt> or is it just me?
[04:57:59] <Echoes2_> sorry for slow reply: http://jsfiddle.net/24945/ here's the code that's not loading in the JSON feed in IE
[04:58:06] <pratz> hey guys any simple tool tip plugin , just need to display two lines ??
[04:59:58] <BlackAnt> I guess I have to stop caching
[05:03:20] <Aamir> pratz:  check console http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/24945/1/
[05:03:26] <Aamir> opps
[05:03:32] <Aamir> Echoes2_:  ^
[05:03:42] <BlackAnt> do I bind?
[05:04:26] <pratz> Aamir: what was that ??
[05:04:37] <Aamir> pratz ignore it
[05:04:51] <Aamir> BlackAnt what happen when you click twice? demo?
[05:04:58] <Echoes2_> Aamir: it's saying 405 method not allowed
[05:04:59] <Echoes2_> on that url
[05:05:14] <BlackAnt> Aamir is a full fledge page
[05:05:17] <darthness> I have a question, i use jquery draggable to move a painting left and right. then save their left value. But i also use sortable so they can be ordered. But i can't make them float left for some reason. float left and the left value don't work well for some reason. How can i make them appear beside each other but also keep the left value in mind?
[05:05:18] <pratz> Aamir: still week end has not started and you already are doing stuff like that
[05:05:56] <Aamir> pratz: :) take it easy, it was just a mistake
[05:06:21] <BlackAnt> Aamir I just have anchor menu links, and I don't want it to load another page, but instead slideIn the id attribute of the page in a div
[05:06:21] <Me-Selfe> darthness: url?
[05:06:23] <pratz> Aamir: i was just kidding yaar
[05:06:36] <darthness> its not an open URL. we can PM if you think you can help me
[05:06:59] <Me-Selfe> i guess
[05:07:06] <BlackAnt> Aamir so after trying, it worked , but when I clicked any meny twice, it does not slideUp or slideDown
[05:07:21] <Aamir> ?demo @BlackAnt
[05:07:21] <bot-t> BlackAnt, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:09:08] <BlackAnt> ok
[05:10:17] <marktuk> can anyone have a look at this for me http://jsfiddle.net/JhxKM/14/
[05:10:40] <marktuk> if you adjust the preview pane so that it scrolls, and try to scroll the sidebar out of the container element, firefox throws an error
[05:10:57] <marktuk> the script should fix the side bar when it hits the bottom of the container, and it used to work
[05:11:11] <marktuk> i've commented the line of code that seems to be at fault...
[05:11:13] <Echoes2_> jsonp ftw
[05:12:58] <BlackAnt> Aamir: http://jsfiddle.net/tCsfV/1/
[05:13:11] <gnarf> marktuk: its pretty hard to read that code
[05:13:36] <gnarf> a) you're using a closure to hide jQuery -> $
[05:13:40] <gnarf> might as well use it
[05:14:09] <BlackAnt> clicking on the anchor tags in the source refuse to trigger the events more than once
[05:14:28] <marktuk> gnarf: which part? i can clean it up a bit...
[05:14:41] <gnarf> marktuk: like all of it
[05:14:46] <gnarf> why are you getting the selector
[05:14:49] <gnarf> and requerying?
[05:15:29] <Aamir> BlackAnt:  u have nexted .clicks :/
[05:15:52] <BlackAnt> Aamir ok, I need help on fixing it
[05:16:01] <marktuk> gnarf: sorry which line?
[05:16:28] <Aamir> BlackAnt:  if you click a.page, it will rebind .click event to the addnews etc
[05:16:52] <BlackAnt> yes
[05:17:35] <Aamir> BlackAnt:  move  $('#addnewscategory') and $('#addnews').click outside a.page.click closure
[05:17:40] * Aamir off for lunch
[05:17:44] <gnarf> marktuk: you should avoid calling jQuery( selector ) multiple times
[05:17:48] <gnarf> ?cache selectors
[05:17:49] <bot-t> gnarf, Google Cache - http://google.com/search?q=cache:selectors
[05:17:56] <gnarf> ?g cache selectors jquery seankoole
[05:17:56] <BlackAnt> Aamir ok thanks, will give it a try
[05:18:04] <gnarf> was that a sean blog?
[05:18:08] <BlackAnt> Aamir lunch was so soon though
[05:18:10] <gnarf> trying to remember who wrote that one
[05:18:11] <gnarf> ?cache
[05:18:27] <Aamir> ?time
[05:18:38] <Aamir> ?weather
[05:18:47] <BlackAnt> its 2:18
[05:18:51] <Aamir> bot-t:  you ok?
[05:18:56] <Aamir> :|
[05:19:06] <shesek> that's weird, googling for 'cache:selectors' actually does bring jquery-related results
[05:19:37] <BlackAnt> ?time btw
[05:20:29] <gnarf> marktuk: much more readable: http://cl.ly/0Z2Z0s0t0f420o16422z
[05:20:57] <gnarf> as far as your broken functionality goes
[05:21:02] <gnarf> i have no idea
[05:21:11] <gnarf> and i'm too tired to debug

[05:30:25] <LoopMeIn> hi all, a more general question: i want a timeout to stop working if a tab/window loses focus and continues working if they have focus again? is there some way to do this
[05:30:35] <LoopMeIn> ?
[05:31:00] <BlackAnt> tried, it didnt work
[05:31:33] <LoopMeIn> hmm,, how did you try it?
[05:34:35] <ximi> Got a question: I have an array of jquery objects that I want to append to an element on the page. Is there a way to achieve this without looping over the array and appending individually (and thus causing a redraw for each one)?
[05:34:43] <Me-Selfe> LoopMeIn: yes :)
[05:35:00] <LoopMeIn> how how how!!! :D
[05:35:03] <ximi> it was supposed to say appending them individually, sorry
[05:35:32] <BlackAnt> glad it works now
[05:35:36] <Me-Selfe> LoopMeIn: stop the timer when the window lose focus, and start it again when it get focus..
[05:35:45] <marktuk> can anyone have a look at this for me http://jsfiddle.net/JhxKM/19/
[05:36:24] <LoopMeIn> hm, how do you track which timer are active?
[05:36:29] <LoopMeIn> +s
[05:36:39] <Me-Selfe> LoopMeIn: save them in an array or similar..
[05:36:59] <Me-Selfe> or make objects for it.. It all depend on how your code work..
[05:37:19] <LoopMeIn> Me-Selfe: I get the idea, thx
[05:37:35] <LoopMeIn> at least I know if to go left or right now ^^
[05:37:50] <BlackAnt> Aamir thanks for the hint. :)
[05:38:15] <nVee> instead of giving each input field a id/class, is there not a different way to use form elements in jquery? Almost like form.field or something in that like?
[05:41:18] <ximi> here is an example of the problem I described above: http://jsfiddle.net/ximi/3gHyV/
[05:43:34] <Me-Selfe> ximi: wild guess would be to append the .html() to a string in the loop, then add the string after the loop?
[05:44:41] <ximi> ok, but then I'd basically need to get the .html() including the parent element, anyone know of an easy way to do this?
[05:46:16] <marktuk> anyone able to figure this one out? http://jsfiddle.net/JhxKM/22/
[05:46:36] <nVee> instead of giving each input field a id/class, is there not a different way to use form elements in jquery? Almost like form.field or something in that like?
[05:47:10] <fabiobik> how to redirect with jquery?
[05:47:17] <Me-Selfe> ximi: $(element)[0].outerHTML
[05:47:17] <fabiobik> redirect to an page
[05:47:29] <Me-Selfe> you can use javascript...
[05:47:41] <Me-Selfe> document.location.href = 'address';
[05:47:58] <ximi> Me-Selfe: dah, of course. thanks a bunch
[05:48:07] <fabiobik> Me-Selfe thanks
[05:50:09] <Ilie> hi, how can I apply a replace only in the first 5 lines of the page ?
[05:50:18] <nVee> hello
[05:50:39] <Ilie> I use var thePage = $("body");  to get the content of the page, how can I apply a replace only in the first 5 lines ?
[05:50:58] <Me-Selfe> ximi: wonder if thats ie only.. something like wrap("<div>").parent().html() works maybe
[05:51:41] <Me-Selfe> Ilie: whats the first 5 lines of the page?
[05:52:03] <Ilie> It's the output from a bash script, some <pre></pre> text
[05:52:21] <Me-Selfe> rather fix it in the bash script then?
[05:52:24] <Ilie> I don't have any divs, pre, etc.
[05:52:42] <Ilie> Me-Selfe, I would like to do this clientside using javascript and don't touch the script
[05:58:49] <ohcibi> i have a script which adds a radiobutton to a form when a checkbox is clicked (depending if its checked after clicking or not), however if i do it several time, at the third time the radio button is not checked... anyone an idea what this is?
[05:59:11] <McWiney> is there a jQuery solution to highlight/set-selection for copy and pasting?
[05:59:24] <CIDIC> any ajax experts around?

[06:01:10] <Me-Selfe> fabiobik: i don't think you asked a question... Or you answered it yourself
[06:01:30] <fabiobik> Me-Selfe that the awnser?
[06:01:33] <fabiobik> :P
[06:01:52] <UglyBOB> any jquery experts here? Got a frustrating problem that seems unsolvable
[06:02:03] <fabiobik> Me-Selfe sometimes i confuse php with javascript

[06:03:49] <UglyBOB> I made this slideshow: http://kylescousin.com/dev/1/slideshow.php - and each time i click next, the slide shifts like 5 pixels more to the left, when reaching slide 15 or so, the gap has become huge and a part of the previous slide is still showing

[06:05:43] <pielgrzym> maskedinput allows only a fixed mask, whereas I need a dynamic one to format a number: 1000000 -> 1 000 000 or 100000 -> 100 000
[06:05:57] <pielgrzym> on the fly, not after user tabs out of the field :)
[06:07:04] <Goose1984> If i am adding sortables to tabs how do I get it to reorder the dom as well as the tabs
[06:07:36] <Goose1984> I am posting a form and the order of the post is not updating because the sortable is not moving the tab contents
[06:10:54] <amsl> Is there some way I can force my browser to ignore it's web cache when I'm using .load()? I'm trying to pull an updated webpage but my browser is being stubborn and will only reload it if I visit the webpage directly and refresh.
[06:11:02] <Me-Selfe> UglyBOB: borders..
[06:13:56] <gym_jane> is it possible to shake the parent window from within an iframe?
[06:14:16] <UglyBOB> me-selfe... i added the borders to see where the divs start and end
[06:16:36] <coppa> hello people and hi to those who I know
[06:17:17] <coppa> wanted to share a link : http://jquery-css.com/magic-jquery plugin I developped for UI and layout management
[06:17:22] <nVee> instead of giving each input field a id/class, is there not a different way to use form elements in jquery? Almost like form.field or something in that like?
[06:18:16] <Me-Selfe> UglyBOB: they also cause the offset
[06:20:01] <TehCodr> if jquery.keyup is called, how do I perform an event based on what key it is?
[06:20:21] <AxonetBE1> I have 6 links with class product_gallery_zoom_link, and if I click on one, the script runs 6 times, how it comes? http://pastie.org/2115972
[06:20:56] <UglyBOB> ok, i'll try to remove them
[06:21:35] <UglyBOB> that was indeed the problem
[06:21:44] <UglyBOB> tx Me-Selfe!
[06:22:28] <Gather> when using the ajax function to call an api  how can i see what i get back ? I'm just getting "object document" from the tostring
[06:23:24] <Buffon> what's Third-party Code mean ? Plz help
[06:23:54] <Woet> Buffon: this is #jquery, not #basicenglish
[06:24:07] <DarsVaeda> hi, can someone help me out with this one? http://jsfiddle.net/EKX5c/
[06:24:32] <geekbuntu_> coppa, i do not know how well your plugin works, but the documentation is nice - thanks for sharing
[06:25:41] <coppa> thanks geekbuntu_ I search people testing it and annoying me with bugs ;)
[06:26:09] <DarsVaeda> ohh i like to annoy people, how can i help?
[06:26:38] <geekbuntu_> coppa, time is premium for me - can you tell me if you're using html5 or xhtml?
[06:27:02] <coppa> xhtml
[06:32:53] <coppa> DarsVaeda: just change .select by .change
[06:33:27] <coppa> in your fiddle
[06:33:51] <DarsVaeda> fiddled that out already, really stupid me -.- but thanks :)
[06:36:03] <WebGear> ok i have a div with a top margin of 20px an id of say id="stophere" now when i create a link to go to this div it skips the margin and stops after it, ignoring 20px that are hidden at the top, i want the anchor link to stop at at where the edge of the margin is
[06:36:43] <fabiobik> DarsVaeda have you solved the problem?
[06:37:06] <shesek> WebGear, the element actually begins after the margin, the margin isn't a part of the element
[06:37:26] <Buffon> @ DarsVaeda This is the Solve ur problem : http://jsfiddle.net/EKX5c/8/
[06:37:26] <shesek> I would either change that to a padding if possible, or create another zero-height element before that element and link to that
[06:37:31] <DarsVaeda> yeah, the problem was that I read the docu, immediatly saw "select" and then tried for minutes to figure out why it is not working instead of reading the docu again and see that change ^^

[07:01:59] <sm> morning all
[07:02:11] <sm> thanks for jquery
[07:02:16] <Buffon> What's Third-party code means plz help
[07:02:48] <sm> how can I select things relative to an element object ? eg the current event target
[07:03:37] <kborchers> sm you mean like event.target?
[07:03:43] <maqr> how can i go about changing the user's browser to a #fragment but prevent their browse from jumping there? i want to scroll smoothly instead
[07:03:44] <sm> yes
[07:03:54] <Me-Selfe> Buffon: translate.google.com
[07:04:14] <kborchers> not sure i understand your question. event.target gets you the event.target
[07:04:31] <kborchers> you mean relative to event.target?
[07:05:01] <sm> well first a side question, event.target is not totally browser compatible is it ? I'm using something more complicated
[07:05:23] <sm> then yes, can I do something like $(event.target).next(...) ? looks like it
[07:05:32] <kborchers> right
[07:06:12] <maqr> it seems like whenever i set "location.hash", which i need to change the location bar in the browser, it jumps right to the id of the hash, and i can't figure out a way to stop that from happening
[07:06:17] <pissypaw> which is #jquery's favourite development FRAMEWORK? (RoR, Django, Symphony, etc. not dev app)
[07:06:35] <sm> thanks
[07:07:11] <sm> is there a reliable event.target getter provided by jquery ?
[07:08:44] <kborchers> ?event.target @ sm
[07:08:45] <bot-t> sm, event.target: The DOM element that initiated the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[07:09:29] <kborchers> the event as returned from jQuery should always have a target
[07:10:55] <sm> I might have some code that doesn't start with a jQuery event.. not sure
[07:10:59] <sm> thanks, I'll check it out
[07:12:13] <Buffon> what's third-party code means?
[07:12:20] <Buffon> plz help
[07:12:25] <sm> ok, so if I've set up hover handlers with .hover(a,b), they will be called with an event argument guaranteed to have a .target attribute ?
[07:12:35] <pissypaw> Buffon: stuff that doesn't come from the main thing you're talking about
[07:12:54] <pissypaw> Buffon: jquery comes from jquery. a jquery plugin was written for jquery by somebody else. that's third party
[07:14:16] <kborchers> sm in your handlerIn and handlerOut for hover, if you define them as function(event){...}, then yes, your event should have a target
[07:14:36] <sm> great, thanks
[07:15:52] <Aamir> ?g third-party code @Buffon
[07:15:53] <bot-t> Buffon, Applications weakened by third-party code - http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/092210-applications-weakened-by-third-party.html
[07:15:53] <sm> and what about this, can I rely on that ? sorry if these are elementary questions
[07:17:39] <kborchers> sm: this will be in the context of the handler so if you say $(this)... it will refer to the element that is being hovered, see ?hover
[07:17:39] <bot-t> sm, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[07:17:46] <bobbobbins> hey, can someone take a look at this and tell me why my option school_id isn't being passed properly? thanks: http://jsfiddle.net/dLTh7/
[07:18:15] <afink> Hello everyone, is there a way to grab the title attribute of a button that is written with php without binding to a specific event?
[07:18:30] <sm> kborchers: so in a jquery handler, this will always be defined ? how about in non-jquery js code ?
[07:18:54] <kborchers> afink: $("#buttonID).attr('title')
[07:18:55] <bobbobbins> afink, can't you just do $("#idofbutton").attr('title')
[07:18:58] <bobbobbins> ?
[07:19:07] <bobbobbins> yeah...what kborchers said
[07:19:16] <Aamir> bobbobbins:  var someVar = $.extend(settings, options);
[07:19:19] <kborchers> no, what bobbobbins said ;)
[07:19:47] <afink> is is that easy if the button is written by $.post?
[07:20:02] <bobbobbins> Aamir....thanks, I'll try that, why does what I have not work?
[07:20:21] <knapper_tech> if i have a form dropdown, how can i get the html of the currently selected option?
[07:20:35] <Aamir> bobbobbins:  you have to save the extended object in some var otherwise u get default settings
[07:20:35] <knapper_tech> ('form option:selected).html?
[07:20:52] <bobbobbins> Aamir, got it, thanks
[07:20:55] <kborchers> afink: doesn't matter. don't confuse client side with server side scripts. server side will execute first, inserting your button, then you can act on it with javascript
[07:21:16] <afink> bobbobbins, kborchers: nope, this is what I tried:        var session_id = $('#end_presentation').attr("title");  no go
[07:21:23] <Buffon> So third party is risk ?
[07:22:23] <kborchers> afink: and your executing that onDomReady, ie in $(function() {...}); ?
[07:23:14] <afink> kborchers:  similar to $(document).ready ?
[07:23:19] <bobbobbins> Aamir: can i do settings = $.extend(settings, options);  im guessing no, since i tried it and it didn't work
[07:23:20] <kborchers> yes
[07:23:38] <Aamir> bobbobbins: yes u can but wait..
[07:23:54] <afink> yes it is in my document ready however the button is only displayed after another button is clicked, so it won't on the DOM when the page is loaded
[07:24:04] <bobbobbins> Aamir...actually...its saying options doesn't exist, so its not executing the $.extend
[07:24:28] <kborchers> you can't get an attribute of an element until it exists
[07:24:33] <kborchers> ?demo @ afink
[07:24:34] <bot-t> afink, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:26:37] <keir> if i am json encoding the current time and date on the server using a php file and the json come outs like - "June 24, 2011, 3:23 pm" - how do i put this data in an alert with $.getJSON?
[07:27:39] <Aamir> bobbobbins:  here we go settings
[07:27:55] <Aamir> settings
[07:27:57] <Aamir> opps
[07:28:00] <Aamir> http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/dLTh7/1/
[07:28:19] <NoNoNo> keir: http://jqapi.com/#p=jQuery.getJSON
[07:28:27] <keir> $.getJSON('time.php', function(data) { alert(data); });  <<< currently trying this but not working
[07:28:46] <erichynds> you can't alert an object
[07:28:47] <erichynds> use console.log
[07:28:53] <erichynds> and firebug, webkit inspector, etc.
[07:29:16] <NoNoNo> keir: console.log(data)
[07:29:38] <topcat> http://pastebin.com/69rBqRPr See that. Why is display getting set to inline-block once the first hover function is complete
[07:30:56] <bobbobbins> Aamir: so i need that $.()? why is that?
[07:31:16] <Aamir> bobbobbins:  and $.fn.yourMethodName
[07:31:20] <keir> $.getJSON('time.php', function(data) { $('#hidden_date').val('Date:'+data); });   var test = $('#hidden_date').val(); alert(test); worked thanks everyone!
[07:31:44] <Aamir> bobbobbins: you have to pass jQuery object like $(someSelector).yourPluginName
[07:32:14] <bobbobbins> ok
[07:34:02] <keir> this will probaby sound stupid to you guys, but why can I append the (data) to the value of an input but not just alert data directly?
[07:34:03] <geekbuntu_> Aamir, did you forget to include a graph library?
[07:34:04] <afink> kborchers: I'll just use a hidden field, just trying to find a different solution
[07:34:31] <Aamir> geekbuntu_:  what? :/
[07:35:35] <kborchers> afink: wihtout seeing your code i can't be sure but you should be able to just get the title in your click handler after you show the other button. unless you need it before the button exists then, you will need the hidden field
[07:35:36] <geekbuntu_> Aamir, in your var you set graph_type as a var - didn't know if that was referring to a plugin(?)
[07:36:10] <afink> kborchers: ok thanks
[07:36:24] <Aamir> geekbuntu_: sorry not sure what are you talking about? link?
[07:37:01] <geekbuntu_> Aamir, it's your paste to your fiddle
[07:37:17] <Aamir> link?
[07:37:28] <geekbuntu_> scroll up - it is the link 'you' pasted
[07:37:39] <bobbobbins> Aamir: it still doesn't seem to work for me, hang on, i'll paste it
[07:37:39] <egeste_> wow, alot of people in here
[07:37:53] <geekbuntu_> egeste, you should see the php room
[07:37:56] <egeste> lol

[07:38:40] <egeste> I'm listening for events using a comet-style long polling ajax POST request - but while that's waiting I would also like to make other events. Is this possible in jquery?
[07:38:41] <geekbuntu_> Aamir, does your var have graph in it?
[07:38:48] <keir> can anyone please tell me what  data represents in this? >> $.getJSON('time.php', function(data) { $('#hidden_date').val('Date:'+data); }); >> appreciate your patience
[07:39:28] <Aamir> geekbuntu_:  link this: http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/dLTh7/2/ ?
[07:39:37] <hongymagic> kerir: assuming time.php returns JSON
[07:39:38] <bobbobbins> i take that back, it is sort of working
[07:39:43] <Phrogz> keir: Whatever the JSON object returned from the server was.
[07:39:46] <Aamir> bobbobbins: cool
[07:39:48] <hongymagic> keir: it represents the json
[07:39:59] <kborchers> ?jQuery.getJSON @ keir
[07:39:59] <Phrogz> (As a JS object, not as a JSON string.)
[07:40:00] <bot-t> keir, jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [callback]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/

[07:41:26] <egeste> other requests*
[07:41:51] <afink> kborchers: my problem was not setting async:false in my ajax call
[07:42:19] * kborchers *shudders*
[07:42:31] <egeste> afink: what issue were you trying to solve?
[07:42:38] <kborchers> there should be a better way other than not using async requests
[07:43:04] <DarsVaeda> can I somehow use jquery ui's fade in and out to replace a text with a textinput? what do you think?
[07:43:04] <ohcibi> uhm... am i right that IE 8 does not support const????
[07:43:21] <hongymagic> i dont think ie6-8 support const at all
[07:43:25] <afink> hmm, it was just one where I was trying to grab the var from the button being written by the ajax call
[07:43:28] <ohcibi> wow
[07:43:34] <kborchers> egeste: afink was trying to get the title attr of a button before it existed in the dom.
[07:43:37] <ohcibi> i knew that IE is bad, but that its THAT bad....
[07:43:43] <hongymagic> unless you're writing for a specific js engine
[07:43:47] <hongymagic> try avoiding const
[07:44:18] <ohcibi> people should try to avoid IE 8-)
[07:44:20] <afink> kborchers:  it was written before I tried to grab the title
[07:44:36] <hongymagic> well that's a different story altogether
[07:44:47] <kborchers> afink: once the button is inserted in the dom in your success callback from $.ajax, then grab the title inside the success callback not outside. then you can use async: true
[07:45:43] <ohcibi> hongymagic: true
[07:45:54] <keir> right ok thanks for that peeps :P
[07:46:04] <afink> kborchers: I'm unfamiliar with that I will check it out, thank  you
[07:46:09] <keir> so if i wanted to alert the (data) i would first have to convert it to a string?
[07:46:27] <kborchers> afink: you should really try to not set async: false. that defeats the whole purpose of the first A in AJAX ... Asynchronous. ;)
[07:46:39] <afink> right, success it is
[07:46:40] <hongymagic> keir: you can use console.log(data) to print the object into most javascript consoles
[07:46:55] <hongymagic> F12 in IE, Firebug in Firefox, Webkit inspectors in Safari/Chrome
[07:47:25] <necromancer> <3 jquery.validate
[07:47:47] <kborchers> necromancer: that is a very nice plugin
[07:48:12] <maqr> does anyone have any clues how i might change location.hash in the location bar without actually jumping the browser to the #id?
[07:49:07] <hongymagic> yeah don't include any elements that have id="hash value"
[07:49:18] <bobbobbins> Aamir: http://jsfiddle.net/dLTh7/4/ this is the real problem here
[07:49:51] <maqr> hongymagic: hrm, i guess so... i hadn't thought of that
[07:50:05] <t432> is this the correct way to write something within teh div? $("#sucess").html("Your details have been sent!");
[07:50:11] <t432> dosnt seem to work
[07:50:18] <keir> thanks console.log is handy
[07:50:18] <egeste> I'm
[07:50:21] <egeste>                 making a long-polling ajax request to listen for events, and when one is
[07:50:24] <egeste>                 received, I continue to listen for new events. This works well, but in the
[07:50:28] <egeste>                 meantime I need to send more requests. It appears that I cannot send any new
[07:50:31] <egeste>                 requests using the $.ajax function until the previous one completes. Is
[07:50:35] <egeste>                 there a way to do this? Here is the relevant code:

[07:51:09] <Aamir> bobbobbins:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/dLTh7/5/
[07:51:38] <bobbobbins> Aamir: argh, i just needed the $this!
[07:52:05] <Aamir> bobbobbins:  not only that. you were passing arguments which is undefined
[07:53:05] <bobbobbins> got it, thank you!
[07:53:55] <Phrogz> egeste: a) Whoa buddy, watch the pasting! b) I don't know of any such limitation with jQuery. Indeed, I specifically do extra work to prevent overlapping ajax requests. (Though I'm not using $.ajax directly, AFAIK all jQuery AJAX methods use it internally.)
[07:55:35] <egeste> sorry about that Phrogz, #jquery.
[07:55:49] <hongymagic> egeste: have you seen socket.io?
[07:56:39] <necromancer> can the equalTo method in jQuery.validate be any valid Sizzle selector?
[07:59:19] <ericincoldohio> I want to find the 4th div inside of: $(this).parent().parent()    i'm not sure where I use the nth child selector in something like that
[08:00:24] <maqr> hongymagic: i can't believe i didn't realize that sooner... ty
[08:00:27] <maqr> totally works :)
[08:01:04] <kborchers> ericincoldohio: $(this).parent().parent().children("div:nth-child(4)"); i believe
[08:01:56] <hongymagic> maqr: sweet. you can bind it too an event as well; like:
[08:01:56] <hongymagic> $('a[href^=#]').bind('click', function (event) { event.preventDefault(); window.location.hash = 'yo'; });
[08:02:43] <ericincoldohio> awesome thanks...was trying to use next instead of children
[08:02:48] <maqr> hongymagic: yeah, i'm using that jquery bbq library, which does some magic and gives me an event
[08:02:51] <maqr> seems pretty robust
[08:03:36] <maqr> it's a bit wiggly in IE7, but whatever, that browser is like 5 years old
[08:04:07] <hongymagic> jquery.history plugin is also quite nice, but it seems like both BBQ and jQuery History plugins are outdated
[08:04:34] <hongymagic> most newer browsers have pushState support which you might like to venture into
[08:04:51] <hongymagic> then fall back to #! or # solution on unsupported browsers
[08:05:21] <maqr> hongymagic: i thought that when i looked at the changelogs... but then again, i'm trying to support a browser made in 2006
[08:05:32] <maqr> so i'm not sure that they really get outdated, heh
[08:06:12] <maqr> hongymagic: yeah, i was reading about the whole #! google indexing magic... definitely cool stuff, but the framework i'm working with is kind of crappy, and i don't know if i can do a whole site loaded dynamically like that
[08:08:25] <hongymagic> if (!history.pushState) { $('*').remove(); }
[08:09:41] <necromancer> can i validate multiple forms with the same validation JS code?
[08:12:48] <timmywil> .
[08:16:18] <necromancer> hey guys i'm having some trouble with jQuery.validate...it seems to only validate the first form passed into the selector: https://gist.github.com/1044991 -- the commented out .validate() call is the fix i applied but i feel like this is wrong and there must be a less verbose way of validating multiple forms per page
[08:17:05] <topcat> does JQ wait for animate to complete before moving on to the next thing in the function
[08:22:54] <rethus> can i create an object userDetail, and add "data" as key, and another Object as value of this key?
[08:23:22] <danheberden> rethus sure
[08:23:44] <rethus> userDetail {data: Object(someStuff), data1: Object(OtherStuff)}
[08:23:47] <rethus> k.
[08:24:34] <danheberden> ?eval var a = { foo: "bar" }, b = { baz: "omg", data: a }; a.checkThisOut = "wat"; b;
[08:24:34] <bot-t> danheberden: {"baz": "omg", "data": {"foo": "bar", "checkThisOut": "wat"}}
[08:24:40] <danheberden> rethus ^
[08:25:06] <danheberden> see how messing with var a after i assigned it to the object in b still persisted changes?
[08:25:52] <rethus> ok, i'll try to reproduce and understand this
[08:41:45] <keir> can anyone tell me a good channel to get help with php?
[08:41:46] <lessless> guys, any ways to rotate background image ?
[08:41:53] <illmatix> keir: #php
[08:42:15] <shesek> s/#/##/
[08:42:29] <keir> says i must be invited to that channel
[08:43:25] <Iszak[L]> not invited, just registered and identified
[08:45:39] <lathan> Iszak[L], do you know where the instructions for that are?
[08:45:44] <lathan> I still can't get my nick registered
[08:46:08] <Iszak[L]> lathan, ask in #freenode or /msg nickserv help identify, or so
[08:46:34] <lathan> when I try to msg nickserv (with that command) I get: message: Nickname not found
[08:46:35] <Rushing> does anyone know if this is the intended behavior of event namespaces? http://jsfiddle.net/TDbJN/
[08:47:59] <mehale> is there a way to match only the nth <td> on every <tr> ?
[08:48:11] <lathan> Rushing, no

[08:48:19] <jedimind> uhh... yeah
[08:48:32] <jedimind> oh right you said "no" to Rushing
[08:48:47] <dimitris5> im trying to implement this http://www.htmldrive.net/items/show/492/jQuery-Safari-searcher  in here http://weknowbettermarketing.com/wkb/  can you help me? It wont work, i tried everything
[08:49:05] <Rushing> lathan, are you saying you don't know, or no, that is not the intended behavior?
[08:49:19] <mehale> kewl! thanks
[08:49:22] <lathan> Rushing, that is not what is intended, and I don't believe it works
[08:50:01] <necromancer> can you inject text (like a "-") in front of errors w/ jQuery.validate??
[08:50:24] <Rushing> not sure what you mean by "works" lol...it is outputing what i expect. although, i created this because the general behavior is not what i expect
[08:50:30] <Rushing> let me create a cleaner version with more info
[08:52:11] <keir> don't suppose anyone can help me with file_put_contents - sorry i know its wrong room
[08:52:12] <DarsVaeda> say, if you test this example does it blink for you to? (if you hover "container0" -> http://jsfiddle.net/eyUvD/
[08:52:30] <lathan> Rushing, at least in chrome, I don't get any console logs
[08:53:10] <necromancer> dimitris5: by design, that plugin will only work with Firefox and Opera.
[08:54:05] <dimitris5> necromancer: im trying it on FF5
[08:54:06] <necromancer> dimitris5: and it barely works on firefox 5
[08:54:30] <necromancer> dimitris5: yeah but IE, Chrome & Safari have a huge market share. do you really want to alienate everyone who uses those browsers?
[08:54:34] <Rushing> lathan, i'm not trying to log to the console
[08:54:35] <dimitris5> necromancer: the demo works just fine
[08:54:47] <keir> can anyone tell me how to change the location that file_put_contents writes to?
[08:54:50] <dimitris5> necromancer: for some reasone i cant import it in my website
[08:56:08] <kborchers> keir: have you tried #php
[08:56:24] <keir> how do i register so i can get in the room?
[08:56:38] <necromancer> keir: ##php is the correct channel
[08:56:44] <necromancer> and type /msg NickServ HELP REGISTER
[08:56:53] <keir> thanks :D
[08:56:54] <necromancer> dimitris5: first of all, you are using an extremely old version of jQuery
[08:56:55] <kborchers> keir: sorry, meant ##php
[08:57:15] <djQuery>  /join #php
[08:57:29] <djQuery> \join #php
[08:58:03] <DarsVaeda> say, if you test this example does it blink on the fade effect for you too? (if you hover "container0" -> http://jsfiddle.net/eyUvD/
[08:58:15] <dimitris5> necromancer: yes but the demo works on the same version
[08:58:23] <keir> how do i change my nickname?
[08:58:30] <necromancer> dimitris5: it should work on a later version of jQuery...if it doesn't don't use it
[08:58:37] <necromancer> it's not in active development and dangerous to use
[08:58:53] <lessless> so, people - is there any way to rotate background image or i must use a variable to keep it state and load other image in dependence with it ?
[08:59:12] <lessless> (bet on that my english is brain-crashing :))
[08:59:19] <seutje> oh crap "attempt to run compile-and-go script on a cleared scope" q.q
[08:59:34] <Chibby_> is there a way to access the next sibling of the current dom element $(this) you have?

[09:00:15] <Chibby_> cool thanks
[09:00:44] <djmobile> Hello. Having some difficulty hiding then showing options in a select. .hide() and .show() work in FF of course but fails in IE. I'm looking at cloning all the options then detaching() the elements I want to hide then cloning them back.
[09:00:45] <djQuery> Chibby_: dont u love it when ur quest has the answer in it
[09:00:50] <djmobile> Meeting great fail
[09:00:58] <necromancer> dimitris5: regardless, you also don't have the styles for jSearcher loaded, so you won't see it
[09:01:09] <Chibby_> heh d:
[09:01:27] <necromancer> dimitris5: but like i said, it's not functionally working for me on FF5 in either the demo or your site. it will look good, but it probably won't function properly
[09:01:55] <necromancer> dimitris5: be careful with scripts that use age-old versions of jQuery, and just as a rule of thumb try not to download shit from "script sites", because the plugins usually suck
[09:02:14] <logik-bomb> say I have something like [ $(this).find('ul li a').click(function() { ] how can I know the position of $this inside the parent ul ? Thank you
[09:02:28] <dimitris5> necromancer: its not my desicion, i was asked to add this search plugin
[09:02:44] <seutje> this must be the most blurry, random error message I've ever gotten :(
[09:03:09] <necromancer> dimitris5: this specific one?
[09:03:11] <necromancer> that's strange
[09:03:12] <djmobile> My approach has been: $clone = $("select option").clone(true,true); then as we click anchors that filter the list the matching elements are detach()ed. When a new filter is clicked
[09:03:16] <seutje> and now it's gone... didn't even change anything o.O
[09:03:26] <necromancer> i usually get asked for features, not for plugins. i determine whether i will use a plugin in my code or simply hand-write the action
[09:03:28] <dimitris5> necromancer: yes
[09:03:34] <djmobile> the entire option list is cloned back to the $(select) but then the filters fail. Is this a binding problem?
[09:03:35] <kborchers> logik-bomb: you mean physical position?
[09:04:21] <logik-bomb> kborchers: the order sorry. ul li li li[$this] li li>/ul
[09:04:22] <tuhoojabotti> Anyone else tried using $.bind with popstate? :D
[09:04:37] <djQuery> logik-bomb: what are u trying to do with this that you need the position?
[09:04:45] <tuhoojabotti> Oh wait
[09:04:53] <tuhoojabotti> I'm doing it wrong probably
[09:05:07] <djQuery> logik-bomb: and by position do you mean index

[09:16:10] <fogggg> I'm using .val to get the value of a textbox and then posting it using $.ajax.. however when there are charcters like (A=1) I get uncaught exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression... Why is it trying to evaluate it? Here is the code http://jsfiddle.net/gX6kT/

[09:18:40] <Ilie> thank you fogggg
[09:18:42] <fogggg> but if i include something like (A=1) it seems to try and evaluate it

[09:20:17] <jethrot> we went with datejs.com
[09:20:25] <Rushing> DarsVaeda, checkout the :focused selector
[09:20:32] <DarsVaeda> thx
[09:20:34] <Rushing> might just be :focus

[09:21:25] <ajpiano> Rushing, seems to be working fine in 1.6
[09:22:18] <fogggg> ive updated the code to show the entire funtion: http://jsfiddle.net/gX6kT/2/     the code works fine unless the contents of the text box contains things like (A=3) and then it seems to try and evaluate it for some reason? is there a way I can just force it to pass it as a string
[09:22:40] <Chibby_> hmm, if i'm inside a function, and i want to do say $('input').hide(); but i don't want it to do that to $(this) (which is an input element), is there someway to do that? i tried $('input').is(!this).hide() but that didn't seem to work
[09:22:46] <ajpiano> fogggg: what do you mean, "evaluate" it
[09:23:06] <ajpiano> do you mean it URL encodes the = inside of the field?
[09:23:29] <ajpiano> cause uh, that's what it should be doing
[09:23:36] <kborchers> Chibby_ you need a more specific selector for the input you want to hide. does it have an id or class that is unique to it?
[09:23:41] <fogggg> i dont know really..   i guess that doesnt make sense... but if the text box just contains normal text everything works great.. but when the text box contains something like (A=1) suddenly i get the unrecognized expression
[09:24:02] <ajpiano> Chibby_: $("input").not(this).whatever();
[09:24:08] <Chibby_> i want to hide all of the other inputs
[09:24:09] <ajpiano> .is() is not a filtering method
[09:24:13] <Chibby_> ah, ok
[09:24:15] <Chibby_> thanks muchly
[09:24:16] <kborchers> ajpiano +1
[09:24:32] <Rushing> ajpiano: doh, right. thanks. so it is expected that triggering "init" on a child element will dispatch "init.whatever" handlers on parents?
[09:24:38] <fogggg> so it seems like it is doing something with the contents of the text and i just want to pass it
[09:24:56] <ajpiano> fogggg: well since again, your live demo doesn't work, and has a syntax error
[09:24:59] <ajpiano> i can't see that
[09:25:21] <lessless> how i can access a inside li in $('ul li').each(function(index) {..} ?
[09:25:52] <ryanneufeld> lessless: this will be the current li
[09:26:00] <ajpiano> fogggg: you might have to create the URL string manually... jQuery's param method automatically url encodes things
[09:26:04] <ajpiano> like equals signs
[09:26:11] <ajpiano> but then again, you're posting... so there is no url string to ... have
[09:26:15] <ryanneufeld> lessless: so $(this).yourjquerymethod();
[09:26:44] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: he's just posting text
[09:26:47] <fogggg> if i use escape or encode or whatever it works fine but then it ends up encoding it twice
[09:26:55] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: he's not assigning a key to that value
[09:27:08] <ryanneufeld> so the whole text is the key with no value
[09:27:20] <ryanneufeld> that's why the = is messing him up
[09:27:42] <ajpiano> splain that to him ;)
[09:27:49] <lessless> ryanneufeld, e.g. $(this) ?
[09:27:58] <ryanneufeld> wait, looks like I'm wrong, I missed it
[09:28:01] <ryanneufeld> and lessless yes
[09:28:13] <sm_> I have something like $('tr.class').mouseleave(f). f does not seem to be triggered when moving down over the next row (which has same class). Is this normal ?
[09:28:25] <ryanneufeld> lessless: $(this) will be a jquery wrapped li element in the example you've given
[09:28:53] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld, ya, i didn't actually... see what you were indicating there
[09:29:39] <ryanneufeld> yeah, my bad
[09:31:01] <ryanneufeld> kinda hard to help the guy without a working demo though
[09:31:10] <ryanneufeld> could be any number of things wrong with the rest of his markup
[09:32:16] <fogggg> ajpiano: actually the text that causes it to break isnt the (A=1) part... its whenver there is a blank line at the end.. any idea why that would cause issues?
[09:32:56] <lessless> ryanneufeld, i got this, but how do i access <a> inside li ? <li><a href="#">some link</a></li> while $(this) is current li ?
[09:33:07] <kborchers> lessless: $(this).children('a')
[09:33:18] <ryanneufeld> ^^^^ that's one way
[09:33:31] <ryanneufeld> $(this).find('a') is another
[09:33:37] <ryanneufeld> either will work
[09:33:52] <ryanneufeld> not sure which is faster, I think .children() is
[09:33:53] <lessless> no, it goes further, acutally i have <li><a></a><ul><li><a></a></li></ul></li>
[09:34:22] <ryanneufeld> fogggg: you need to setup a working fiddle for people to help you
[09:34:47] <lessless> and even with ":first-children" it change nested a, not the first
[09:34:48] <ryanneufeld> ?p @lessless
[09:34:48] <bot-t> lessless, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:34:50] <fogggg> How can I do that when it realies on  having input boxes
[09:35:11] <ryanneufeld> fogggg: learn how to use jsfiddle
[09:35:40] <cakehero> Whats the defacto jQuery inplace edit plugin?
[09:36:06] <ryanneufeld> fogggg: take 20mins and figure it (jsfiddle) out. make a reduced test case, and you might find that you solve your problem in the process.
[09:37:38] <selckin> how do i search for a class and when a matching element is found ignore everything under that element?
[09:38:29] <kborchers> selckin: $(".className:first") ? you mean you just want the first element found right?
[09:38:50] <selckin> first in even leaf node
[09:39:18] <bobbobbins> i have a question: I have a var named function_name and I want to use it to call a plugin...but im not sure how to do that... you can see it here http://jsfiddle.net/dLTh7/6/
[09:39:55] <bobbobbins> that $.fn.spdi.graduation() should be $.fn.spdi.function_name() but with function_name translating to graduation....
[09:40:21] <selckin> kborchers: so i have like a > b > foo > foo, and a > bar > foo, and $("a").find("foo"), for example, i only want to find the first "foo" in every tree leaf type thing
[09:40:31] <selckin> so 2 in this case
[09:40:35] <logik-bomb> sirs, $('#selector').myFuntionInitialize();  how can I pass the value of my selector inside my function?
[09:41:10] <kborchers> hmmm
[09:41:44] <ajpiano> bobbobbins: $.fn.spdi[function_name]();
[09:42:21] <bobbobbins> ajpiano: thanks! lemmie give that a whirl
[09:44:27] <kborchers> selckin: not sure if a selector will get you there. i would think you would have to do something like $("a").children().each(function() { //add $(this).find("foo:first") to some array created outside of each }); then array contains all found elements
[09:44:31] <bobbobbins> this might be a dumb question...i know in php if you include something twice it can cause a lot of issues...if i include a js file twice, does it just ignore it...or could it potentially break something?
[09:44:58] <ajpiano> bobbobbins you shouldn't include it twice, it could certainly have potential repercussions
[09:45:25] <bobbobbins> is there some sort of include once function, or a way to test if something has been included?
[09:45:32] <ajpiano> binding events multiple times, obliterating things that already should have been defined
[09:45:38] <ajpiano> depends on what the something is
[09:45:48] <kborchers> bobbobbins: check out http://yepnopejs.com/
[09:46:14] <bobbobbins> kborchers, thanks, this might be what i need

[09:50:15] <Sir_J> here is my code var options = div.find('div.b-find-option:visible');
[09:50:26] <Sir_J> now I want to fine the one that has class m-over
[09:50:34] <Sir_J> code options.find('.m-over') doesn't work
[09:50:38] <shesek> Sir_J, probably find() or filter()
[09:50:39] <Sir_J> it returns 0 elements
[09:50:56] <Sir_J> filter ? hmm... one sec
[09:50:57] <lessless> guys, http://jsfiddle.net/7F5ya/
[09:51:03] <shesek> Sir_J, are you trying to find specific element(s) from the collection or childerns of elements in the collection ?
[09:51:08] <kborchers> ?p @ Sir_J
[09:51:08] <bot-t> Sir_J, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:51:12] <lessless> i try to access first upper a.expandable
[09:51:19] <Sir_J> shesek children elements in the collection
[09:51:21] <lessless> http://jsfiddle.net/7F5ya/
[09:51:28] <shesek> Sir_J, that's filter() than, not find()
[09:51:40] <Sir_J> shesek, one moment, I'll try that
[09:51:52] <lessless> from inside the cycle
[09:52:44] <shesek> Sir_J, no, you're trying to filter the elements which are already in the collection
[09:52:44] <shesek> according to your descriptiopn
[09:53:30] <Sir_J> shesek you are absolutely right, it works
[09:53:32] <Sir_J> thank you
[09:53:43] <lessless> <li> <a>the target</a> <ul> <li><a>i am inside here</a></li> <li><a>some other item</a></li> </ul> </li>
[09:53:43] <Sir_J> and how can I get next element inside my collection ?
[09:54:46] <sm_> shesek: ok.. https://gist.github.com/1045188
[09:55:15] <marko3831> hey all.  i need to have a flag variable that is related to one of my jquery objects.. would it be advisable to create this flag in normal global area in javascript or extend the flag onto the jquery object ?
[09:55:40] <sm_> shesek: I see accountMouseLeave's event target change after adding line 10
[09:55:56] <Sir_J> shesek, in the code <ul><li>1</li><li style='display:none'>2</li><li>3</li></ul> If I selected li that contains 1 how can I get "next visible" element, in that case li that contains 3 ?
[09:56:31] <ryanneufeld> ?hi5 @ ajpiano
[09:56:31] <bot-t> ajpiano, ‚Åµ
[09:56:32] <djQuery> Sir_J: .next(':visisble')
[09:56:34] <shesek> Sir_J, next(':visible')
[09:58:20] <shesek> sm_, well... that makes sense, you're binding for the mouse enter event of the <a> element
[09:58:29] <Sir_J> shesek, one moment please
[10:01:40] <Whirl3d> Hey all. How do I get ajax to load new content? I keep getting the cached version of the document that I am supposedly loading.
[10:02:32] <kborchers> Whirl3d cache: false
[10:02:55] <kborchers> ?ajax @ Whirl3d
[10:02:56] <bot-t> Whirl3d, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:02:57] <shesek> Whirl3d, there all all kinds of solutions, but the best one is to simply add a unique string to the URL
[10:03:06] <Whirl3d> duh, I dunno what my problem is some times. Thanks for that, sorry for the stupid question.
[10:03:10] <Sir_J> shesek, http://jsfiddle.net/QxPTe/4/
[10:03:12] <Sir_J> here is my code
[10:03:16] <SoundLogic> ben_alman do you have a link to the geomap plugin you're going to give a talk on in July?
[10:03:26] <Sir_J> construction like .next(':visible') doesn't work for me
[10:03:57] <shesek> Sir_J, hold on
[10:05:19] <shesek> Sir_J, my bad - try nextAll(':visible:eq(0)')
[10:05:27] <Sir_J> one sec
[10:06:24] <Sir_J> shesek, it works, thank you
[10:06:37] <Sir_J> but why just next(':visible') doesn't work in this case ?
[10:07:34] <shesek> .next() is the following sibling, just a single element
[10:07:53] <shesek> nextAll() returns all the following siblings under the same parent
[10:08:47] <Sir_J> I see
[10:08:48] <Sir_J> ahh, okay
[10:17:36] <julio> hi, guys dunno if it's a bug in jqueryui autocomplete widget, but somehow it seems like it doesn't work after some of the binded elements are ajax updated
[10:18:21] <kborchers> julio: what do you mean? see ?demo
[10:18:21] <bot-t> julio, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:18:31] <jethrot> yeah use that jsviolin
[10:18:38] <jethrot> it's the world's smallest
[10:18:57] * sm_ figure it out.. I wanted this, not event.target
[10:19:25] <sm_> shesek: thx
[10:25:51] <ace_me> I have a set of images onto which any click is updating a div with other 10-12 images for which I want to add a shadowbox ! should I initiate or should I open shadowbox at load() callback ?
[10:27:05] <julio> kbrochers: don't have a public demo yet, but for example, after a form validation, even if I call autocmplete from console it gives me the error, TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'autocomplete'
[10:27:39] <Axcy> When using the validation plugin, it there any way I can have * appened to all labels of inputs which have a class="required" ?
[10:27:51] <Axcy> $('label.required').append('&nbsp;<strong>*</strong>&nbsp;'); <- Doesn't seem to do the job
[10:28:13] <julio> I know it's not something to get the proper answer from but just to give you any clue
[10:28:31] <dandaman1> how do i select by name; (like $(#myID) would select by id)
[10:29:30] <kborchers> julio: hard to tell what your problem is without code. usually i see that error if i'm not actually dealing with a jQuery object. try wrapping your element you use to call autocomplete with $() so something like $(element).autocomplete...
[10:29:43] <selckin> kborchers: thanks, will manually walk it then
[10:29:54] <billy_ran_away> Anyone familiar with an IBM BladeCenter?  (It leads to a jQuery question bear with me...)  Well you know how it's got the chasis and each Blade, a server, slides into a slot in the chasis?  Well I'm working on a web app to configure them...
[10:30:15] <kborchers> dandaman1: $("element[name='theName']")
[10:30:29] <billy_ran_away> So I'm displaying an image of a BladeCenter and all the blades are in it, but I want to be able to have a user click on each Blade to select it.
[10:30:54] <devinrolsen> good day all.
[10:31:17] <dandaman1> kborchers: ty
[10:31:22] <julio> kborchers: I am doing that, no matter which element I use with selector, even $("document").autocomplete(); gives me the same error
[10:31:44] <billy_ran_away> My first thought is to get an image with of the BladeCenter with no blades in it and then when there is a Blade in a particular slot display it there.  But how could I in HTML line each individual image that is Blade overtop of the BladeCenter image?
[10:31:55] <julio> kborchers: and before ajax validation, partial refresh, it works like a charm
[10:32:40] <kborchers> julio: not sure then without a working sample to look at
[10:33:09] <billy_ran_away> Anyone have any suggestions, links or similar examples?
[10:33:09] <kborchers> billy_ran_away: absolute positioning
[10:34:01] <billy_ran_away> kborchers: Absolute as in referencing the absolute page size?  That would be dependent on the montior and how big the page is relative to it, right?
[10:34:29] <julio> kborchers: unfortuantelly can't have it at the moment. thanks anyway
[10:34:56] <devinrolsen> billy_ran_away, no he is referring to setting each image to be position:absolute; and give them a top:xpx; and left:xpx; value to position them correctly.
[10:35:06] <billy_ran_away> kborchers: Also I'm displaying the rack it's in with the other equipment that is in that rack.  So the blade wouldn't always be in the same spot on the page.  Could I do this with relative (to the BladeCenter image) positing?
[10:35:18] <BlaDe^> ffs lol
[10:35:30] <devinrolsen> but don't forget to give the parent element these images will be nested in a position:relative; other wise it will position aboslute the image to the page, vs. the parent element.
[10:35:40] <kborchers> if you have say a div with relative position and set the background image to the blade center, then position images or divs or what ever absolute inside there, they will be absolute positioned, relative to the parent div
[10:35:57] <billy_ran_away> devinrolsen: Could I dynamically derive those values if my BladeCenter might be in a number of different places on the page?
[10:36:06] <kborchers> devinrolsen types faster than me ;)
[10:37:03] <billy_ran_away> kborchers: Okay, the empty BladeCenter would the background... yea that could work...
[10:37:08] <devinrolsen> billy_ran_away, having not seen your page's setup or fully understanding the request I have to say I don't know.
[10:37:56] <kborchers> billy_ran_away: still didn't see the jQuery part of your question though ;)
[10:38:01] <billy_ran_away> kborchers devinrolsen: Now what would be the best way to show this div on mouseover.  I.e. since it's racks of equipment the initial picture is small, but on mouseover I want to display the bigger picture.
[10:38:11] <billy_ran_away> kborchers: And there it is ^^^^
[10:38:14] <kborchers> lol
[10:38:20] <billy_ran_away> kborchers : )
[10:38:47] <kborchers> ?mouseover @ billy_ran_away
[10:38:47] <bot-t> billy_ran_away, .mouseover(handler): Bind an event handler to the "mouseover" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseover/
[10:38:57] <devinrolsen> there are lots of ways to do this, via pure css with a sprite and pseudo :hover or with jquery mouseover event.
[10:39:06] <devinrolsen> again I would need to see the markup to make a clear choice.
[10:39:07] <billy_ran_away> I'm trying to decide on AJAX to pull the content or just hide it and load it ahead of time.
[10:40:19] <billy_ran_away> Could I position the div with the background relative to the thumbnail in the rack and still be able to position relativaley the individual Blades?
[10:40:25] <devinrolsen> I would go with pre-loading the content if I had to choose vs many requests being sent to the server. I mean why so many requests if its not really needed.
[10:41:10] <billy_ran_away> devinrolsen: Yea that's where I was leading but I worry about the amount of memory the DOM is taking up... it seems like my jQuery validations are slowing everything as is...
[10:41:28] <devinrolsen> billy_ran_away did you already supply a link to your page? Cause I really have no idea about your setup yet.
[10:41:38] <devinrolsen> I logged in mid conversation.
[10:41:49] <billy_ran_away> devinrolsen: No it's not out on the internet yet... sorry.
[10:42:11] <billy_ran_away> devinrolsen: I'm doing this on Ruby on Rails and it's still just being hosted internally on Webrick.
[10:42:18] <devinrolsen> k
[10:43:01] <billy_ran_away> devinrolsen: It's probably exactly as you imagine it... that is like amateur hour.
[10:43:10] <kborchers> billy_ran_away: without seeing it, hard to understand your position question
[10:43:19] <devinrolsen> and ajax questions.
[10:43:34] <devinrolsen> and validation.
[10:43:36] <devinrolsen> ;)
[10:43:57] <dandaman1> if i have a <select id="foo"><option id="bar" selected>foobar</option></select>, and i go $('#foo'), how would i get the id of the selected option from $('#foo')?
[10:44:08] <billy_ran_away> kborchers: I guess the question can I do two levels of relative positioning?
[10:44:26] <devinrolsen> $('#foo option:select').attr('id'); dandamal1
[10:44:42] <devinrolsen> opps 	$('#foo option:selected').attr('id');
[10:44:46] <dandaman1> devinrolsen: is there no way to go $('#foo').selected?
[10:45:20] <kborchers> billy_ran_away: what relative to what?
[10:45:24] <devinrolsen> not if you want to get the id of the options that is selected.
[10:45:58] <kborchers> your blades would be absolute
[10:46:02] <billy_ran_away> kborchers: relative to one staticly positioned image.
[10:47:16] <billy_ran_away> kborchers: So individual Blade images positioned relative to the div with the empty BladeCenter positioned relative to the smaller BladeCenter image in the rack.
[10:48:11] <billy_ran_away> kborchers devinrolsen: I think I got it, thanks for your help even if the jQuery part of the question was a little light... : )  I really appreciate it!
[10:48:18] <kborchers> no, have to be carefult with how you phrase it. your blade center div would be relative to its parent. then anything inside that div would be absolute positioned but those absolute top and left positions would not be based on document but on parent. make sense
[10:48:34] <billy_ran_away> kborchers: Yep : )
[10:48:38] <kborchers> cool
[10:49:20] <billy_ran_away> I'll probably be back next week asking why my jQuery validations are so slow...  : )
[10:51:37] <Null_> having problems with passing get parameters to a php page loaded via ajax in IE only. It works fine in chrome/firefox. Any ideas? I'm really not very good at debugging js yet, especially in IE. http://hansandholly.ca/test/#/pages/listing.php?mls=E2087951
[10:52:07] <Rushing> Null, make sure you have IE8+ with developer tools. pretty similar to Firebug / chrome console
[10:52:29] <Rushing> you can't log objects very well, but you can set a breakpoint in the code and then look at the local variables
[10:53:02] <Null_> Rushing: alright, will see what I can do. Was hoping this was a more common problem with a common solution, heh.  thanks!
[10:53:59] <SkyFlyer> something simple... trying to get this select box to update to color... http://jsfiddle.net/DAxNq/2/
[10:54:11] <Rushing> IE is a common problem ;) working around it is a common solution
[10:54:31] <Null_> normal ajax loads work fine in ie, its only when I do page.php?fu=bar that it doesn't load anything.
[10:55:02] <Rushing> you may need to pass those in as parameters, the same as you would with a post
[10:55:12] <Rushing> so your ajax url would just be "page.php"
[10:55:41] <Rushing> jquery will serialize the parameters into a get, if specified, when the request is initiated
[10:55:43] <djQuery>  Null_ .load('page.php', {"fu": "bar"}, function(){})
[10:56:52] <nicholas_> im having some difficulties with some tabs; i have a link with id='newtab' and when clicked it opens a new tab, but when i load some content from ajax+php and add the id='newtab' to the url it wont open...
[10:56:54] <Null_> ok thanks guys, now just need to know how the heck to make that happen with this crazy ajaxy framework.  Thanks very much.
[10:57:14] <nicholas_> wont open a new tab* ^^
[10:57:21] <unixbeard> I'm trying to initialize and then open a jquery ui dialog after inserting the container into the dom from a cloned template.  I'm trying to debug this problem, but it's re-binding the dialogs and everything it should before calling open.  I'm not sure what else I should do to see why it's not working.
[10:57:49] <unixbeard> nicholas_: You might have to rebind the click event?
[10:58:09] <kborchers> ?demo @ unixbeard
[10:58:10] <bot-t> unixbeard, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:58:12] <dv310p3r> I'm using .load() to load html from another page. When I do so, I am hiding the current div first, then showing the new one after it's loaded. But when the current div is being hidden it flashes stuff from the page that's not supposed to be loaded yet, why?
[10:58:37] <nicholas_> ok thanks, unixbeard, ill try
[10:59:51] <Rushing[away]> ?delegate @ nicholas_
[10:59:51] <bot-t> nicholas_, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[10:59:51] <unixbeard> nicholas_: Maybe something like, $('div[id^="newtab_"]').click( or whatever should be called again, that's my thought.
[11:00:13] <Rushing[away]> or take a look at jQuery.live(), nicholas_
[11:00:14] <unixbeard> If you give your tabs unique IDs I mean
[11:00:20] <nicholas_> ok thanks
[11:00:38] <SkyFlyer> can anyone take a quick look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/DAxNq/2/  not sure what's going on with it.
[11:00:43] <Rushing[away]> if it's a rebinding issue, it's usually best to go with delegate or live
[11:01:25] <unixbeard> Rushing, neat!  I didn't know about .live.
[11:02:04] <unixbeard> I might try that with this particular problem.  I can use the inspector to verify the same elements for a newly inserted record match the pattern for existing records when the page loads, so I figured (for my problem anyway) it was some binding/init problem with the jquery ui dialog.
[11:02:25] <Rushing[away]> SkyFlyer, the error tells you what's wrong: value is not defined
[11:02:36] <Rushing[away]> i think you meant .val(color)
[11:07:24] <djQuery> SkyFlyer: well when it gets the css color its not what u think it was. http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/DAxNq/4/
[11:08:19] <Rushing[away]> ok, well to fix what you had...you had the id of your select wrong and i changed val(value) to val(color): http://jsfiddle.net/DAxNq/5/
[11:08:53] <T-Pup> can someone lend me a second set of eyes on this ? http://jsfiddle.net/aEyUE/
[11:09:01] <T-Pup> trying to validate the max # of checkboxes checked
[11:09:06] <unixbeard> Rushing[away]: is there a pattern for init/opening a jquery ui dialog with .live, or .delegate or whatever?
[11:09:28] <unixbeard> I'm not sure how to make it work without re-initializing a dialog every time it's supposed to be opened.
[11:09:37] <unixbeard> maybe that's the way it should be done.
[11:09:49] <Rushing[away]> it's the same as you would with a click event on another element
[11:10:02] <Rushing[away]> to reopen a dialog, look at the dialog methods and how to call them
[11:10:13] <Rushing[away]> ie. $("#asdf").dialog("open")
[11:11:02] <unixbeard> Before you call open, you have to initialize it.
[11:11:07] <T-Pup> sorry - just updated it -  http://jsfiddle.net/aEyUE/
[11:11:12] <unixbeard> If you're adding a new dialog to the dom.
[11:11:15] <kborchers> T-Pup: $('input[type='checkbox']:checked')
[11:11:44] <unixbeard> I'm using $('div[id^="details_dialog_"]').dialog({ ... }); to initialize them.
[11:12:07] <Rushing[away]> unixbeard: right, so what's the problem?
[11:12:12] <unixbeard> Which works for containers that are already there the first time.  When I add a new container to the dom, I have to initialize it.
[11:12:25] <Rushing[away]> a new container for another dialog?
[11:12:27] <unixbeard> Well, it acts like it hasn't been initialized because the open event is never triggered.
[11:12:32] <SkyFlyer> djQuery. I see that stuff.  I'm trying to get the select to then say "Red" and select the Red option...
[11:12:43] <unixbeard> Yeah, I've verified that it's added using chromium's inspector.  details_dialog_105 or whatever.
[11:12:53] <unixbeard> It's the same HTML as the pre-existing containers.
[11:13:00] <Rushing[away]> ok, if it's a new element, then yeah you need to initialize it
[11:13:12] <unixbeard> Also, in the json response from the add event, I re-initialize it and re-bind the edit button click event that brings up the dialog.
[11:13:24] <unixbeard> (I confirmed the edit click works with an alert, and has the proper id etc.)
[11:13:27] <Rushing[away]> SkyFlyer, i fixed it for you. read up
[11:13:47] <unixbeard> Rushing[away]: So I do re-initialize it using the same pattern, which I'm guessing should re-initialize everything.
[11:13:49] <T-Pup> i'm pretty sure the checkbox:checked works - it worked on other things i've written , think they mean the same thin g
[11:14:21] <Rushing[away]> if you have a new element as your dialog container, yes you need to reinitialize it
[11:14:34] <yacek19> hi

[11:15:10] <SkyFlyer> Rushing. i see the last link you sent.. but the select box doesn't get changed.  what's the reason for that?  on my end the select still doesn't get updated?  i'm trying on IE 9 right now ?
[11:15:14] <kborchers> T-Pup: you're right on the :checkbox:checked. also you don't need that ! operator. and your click is bound to the wrong thing. see http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/aEyUE/7/
[11:15:25] <vacho> I am doing an ajax post that is returning a json array, how do I access the json array?

[11:17:23] <vacho> kborchers, http://pastebin.com/9iHdVXik
[11:17:46] <vacho> that should not give me null at least
[11:18:15] <kborchers> ?alert @ vacho
[11:18:15] <bot-t> vacho, Forget alert‚Äîuse console.log() in Firebug (or your browser‚Äôs built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[11:18:37] <kborchers> and i believe you may get null if what order-entry.php is returning is not JSON
[11:19:09] <JAAulde> 'sup jQuerians?
[11:22:56] <vacho> kborchers, I have jquery,
[11:23:04] <vacho> kborchers, I have firebug I mean :D
[11:23:18] <Kambfhase> give me back ma jQuery!
[11:23:40] <kborchers> ok, so use console.log instead of alert. much better and doesn't hang the browser.
[11:24:12] <kborchers> if you are getting null though, that is what is being sent back from your php

[11:29:26] <kborchers> fabiobik: gonna need to be a little more specific. i don't see an animation start, let alone stop.
[11:29:43] <fabiobik> kborchers F5 please
[11:29:45] <fabiobik> sorry
[11:30:02] <fabiobik> try to submit the form and see what happen
[11:30:24] <kborchers> ok, so you want it to stop?
[11:30:29] <fabiobik> ya
[11:30:33] <fabiobik> and show the content
[11:34:21] <fabiobik> kborchers can u help?
[11:34:41] * kborchers is looking ... but unsure
[11:36:30] <necromancer> in jQuery.validate, can you pass a class name in the rules: {}?
[11:37:06] <sm_> yay slideToggle.. but is there one that goes sideways ?
[11:38:28] <kborchers> fabiobik: not sure how to help. you are doing things in a very strange way. you should really see ?tabs
[11:38:30] <bot-t> fabiobik, UI/API/1.8/Tabs - Tabs are generally used to break content into multiple sections that can be swapped to save space, much like an accordion. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs
[11:38:55] <kborchers> fabiobik: a lot of unnecessary ajax going on there
[11:39:07] <kborchers> makes things hard to follow
[11:39:22] <kborchers> maybe someone else can decipher it
[11:39:28] <kborchers> sorry
[11:41:47] <necromancer> fabiobik: yeah tabs would be perfect for what you're trying to do. i took a look and i have absolutely no idea what's going on, you should really look at jQuery.validate and the jQuery.form plugin
[11:42:09] <necromancer> validate will help you write rules & display messages for client-side validations. the form plugin will submit the form asynchronously
[11:42:31] <necromancer> it uses a function called .ajaxSubmit(
[11:42:34] <necromancer> .ajaxSubmit()*
[11:42:34] <MeetAndGreet> hi all, is it possible to create a .dialog() without the title-line at the top?
[11:43:18] <kborchers> MeetAndGreet: not within dialog() but you can use css to hide it i suppose. any reason why you would do that?
[11:43:41] <necromancer> MeetAndGreet: why not just use facebox?
[11:43:50] <necromancer> http://defunkt.io/facebox/
[11:43:53] <djQuery> fabiobik: see ?g malsup form
[11:43:54] <bot-t> fabiobik, jQuery Form Plugin - jQuery Plugins by malsup - http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[11:44:22] <necromancer> fabiobik: that documentation can get confusing. you don't need ajaxForm. all you need to know is ajaxSubmit
[11:44:28] <MeetAndGreet> i need the space the empty top line takes from my design ;) and i don't need the close-button either
[11:44:52] <sm_> I have "jQuery JavaScript Library v1.4.2".. that does not include jquery UI, right ?
[11:45:10] <kborchers> sm_ no, you need to include that separately
[11:45:12] <necromancer> fabiobik: when you invoke ajaxSubmit it will immediately submit the form asynchronously. you can also pass any $.ajax options in
[11:45:21] <MeetAndGreet> necromancer: I'm not allowed to use more than a blessed jquery and jqery ui, no plugins no nothing ;)
[11:45:31] <systemfault> MeetAndGreet: You could probably use CSS
[11:45:35] <necromancer> haha what
[11:45:37] <kborchers> MeetAndGreet: you'll have to use css then
[11:45:37] <necromancer> that's fucking retarded
[11:45:53] <fabiobik> thanks
[11:45:58] <sm_> kborchers: thanks
[11:46:00] <MeetAndGreet> hmm ok I'll try that
[11:46:01] <necromancer> just copy the facebox code into another JS file called meetbox.js and pretend you wrote it
[11:46:06] <necromancer> and tell your boss to fuck off
[11:46:06] <djQuery> MeetAndGreet: is this for some school project or something?
[11:46:13] <kborchers> MeetAndGreet: that is silly since a lot of ui "widgets" start out as plugins
[11:46:15] <MeetAndGreet> nope
[11:46:41] <MeetAndGreet> yeah, maybe, but tell that to my employee ;p
[11:46:49] <djQuery> MeetAndGreet: why stop reinvinting the wheel there why not just reinvent jquery and ui
[11:46:55] <systemfault> MeetAndGreet: You add a new class to the dialog when creating it with {dialogClass: "theclass"} in the config... and just .ui-dialog-titlebar.theclass {display: none; } // something like that.
[11:47:18] <MeetAndGreet> ah thx
[11:47:24] <systemfault> It's fine to not want a thousand plugins...
[11:47:29] <Rushing> overlays are pretty simple to create custom...widget framework is far superior to plugins for that kind of stuff anyways
[11:47:37] <systemfault> It also helps to keep the look & feel more consistent.
[11:47:39] <djQuery> systemfault: MeetAndGreet: did the same thing to hide the close button before
[11:47:59] <systemfault> djQuery: Ah :P
[11:48:06] <MeetAndGreet> hm k :D
[11:48:42] <kborchers> systemfault: agreed. i'm all about just doing it with UI if possible but if a plugin is good and does what you need, silly to say you can't use it
[11:49:04] <djQuery> MeetAndGreet: example included http://stackoverflow.com/questions/896777/remove-close-button-on-jqueryui-dialog/5301251#5301251
[11:49:26] <systemfault> kborchers: But adding a new plugin VS using an existing one and just hiding the titlebar..
[11:49:45] <systemfault> Using the existing one also means he won't have to restyle it.
[11:50:10] <systemfault> Adding a class isn't exactly a difficult task.
[11:50:18] <kborchers> right, which was my suggestion in the first place. ;) i was more just commenting on the no plugin thing in general, not pulling for the use of the plugin
[11:50:21] <necromancer> systemfault: that's not my job. my job is to code what i was given in a design, not do the designer's work.
[11:50:28] <djQuery> kborchers: especialy some of the better ones that actualy come with unit tests etc...
[11:50:29] <necromancer> [2:47 PM] <systemfault> It also helps to keep the look & feel more consistent.
[11:50:54] <systemfault> necromancer: HALP T3H DESIGN3RZ
[11:51:00] <necromancer> uhh no?
[11:51:08] <necromancer> they can go ahead and pay me twice what i make
[11:51:15] <necromancer> if they want me to do that
[11:51:17] <necromancer> :)
[11:51:19] <systemfault> :D
[11:51:34] <necromancer> i think that's kind of a problem sometimes when dealing with outsourced designers
[11:52:07] <kborchers> necromancer: and internal ;)
[11:52:10] <Nomikos> I am doing an $.ajax() call with type "POST", but it still performs a GET according to the server logs, why is that?
[11:52:23] <Nomikos> It's jsonp, if that matters
[11:52:32] <systemfault> Then it's obvious.
[11:52:37] <necromancer> kborchers: yeah i guess it depends on how big your office is. :) our designer is like up the stairs, so we can just yell to her if something breaks
[11:52:41] <systemfault> JSONP isn't AJAX
[11:52:44] <djQuery> I alwasy thought that the whole point of going with jquery\ui was the numerous comunity generated plugins?
[11:52:49] <systemfault> That's anoter jQuerism
[11:52:52] <necromancer> wait
[11:52:54] <systemfault> *another even
[11:52:57] <necromancer> how is jsonp not ajax?
[11:53:15] <necromancer> djQuery: jquery, not ui. ui is trash imo
[11:53:16] <Nomikos> systemfault: I.. commented out the datatype and yes, it's Post now
[11:53:44] <Rushing> systemfault, jsonp is ajax, but ajax isn't necessarily jsonp
[11:53:48] <Nomikos> systemfault: is jsonp always Get?
[11:53:48] <systemfault> necromancer: JSONP == create a script tag, attach a link to a javascript file to load it then execute a callback function without that function.
[11:53:54] <MeetAndGreet> djQuery: systemfault : woooh, that works great :D
[11:53:56] <Nomikos> Doh! of course
[11:53:58] <systemfault> Nomikos: Yes it is
[11:54:03] <djQuery> necromancer: still that would be a valid point for going with ui just as it would be for going with jquery
[11:54:08] <Nomikos> and a src uri can never be a post..
[11:54:16] <MeetAndGreet> at last, some px won ^^
[11:54:17] <Nomikos> systemfault: thanks!
[11:54:21] <systemfault> Nomikos: :)
[11:54:47] <necromancer> djQuery: jQuery-UI doesn't have a huge base of community generated plugins, it's just a suite of plugins for jQuery maintained by the jQuery team and demonstrating what is possible with the library. just like jQuery Tools or Wijmo.
[11:54:57] <kborchers> necromancer: wondering what your issue is with UI
[11:55:03] <necromancer> kborchers: it's ugly
[11:55:13] <necromancer> (personal opinion btw)
[11:55:25] <kborchers> so style it ;)
[11:55:27] <necromancer> actually using the plugins for UI is pretty nice, it just doesn't look good
[11:55:32] <djQuery> necromancer: lol thats funny half the jquery tools items are inheriting from jquery ui
[11:55:52] <necromancer> yeah djQuery it was meant to be an extension for people who already use jQUI
[11:56:05] <Rushing> necromancer, you know you can reskin it right? and not just with their tools. it tries to standardize on a hiearchy of classes so that more themes will be applicable
[11:56:07] <necromancer> kborchers: it takes me less time to replicate the plugins' functionality than to fiddle around with the limitations of jQuery UI..
[11:56:16] <erichynds> necromancer: changes to the CSS framework are landing (or have been landed, dunno) that'll make themes like this possible: http://forrst.com/posts/jQuery_UI_Alternate_Theme_in_Progress-gCV
[11:56:35] <Rushing> necromancer: i'll give you that, in some cases
[11:56:35] <erichynds> cc dougneiner
[11:56:39] <lathan> necromancer, really, you can impliment tabs faster w/out UI ?
[11:56:53] <lathan> full tabs, with adding and removing, ......
[11:56:54] <kborchers> lathan +1
[11:57:01] <Rushing> lathan, if something needs to be changed, yes
[11:57:02] <necromancer> lathan: no, but i NEVER need to
[11:57:06] <Rushing> tabs are very simple
[11:57:12] <Rushing> so are accordions
[11:57:13] <necromancer> a much more simplifed version of tabs suffices
[11:57:18] <necromancer> and i can make that in 15 minutes
[11:57:31] <necromancer> tabs is complicated because it's configurable
[11:57:34] <systemfault> The alternate jQuery UI theme is cute.
[11:57:39] <lathan> I often make my own accordions because I need multiple of them open.....
[11:58:06] <lathan> $('#accordian').delegate('.heading','click',function(){ $(this).next().toggle(); });
[11:58:12] <necromancer> it's a general purpose plugin that's meant for many situations.
[11:58:13] <lathan> and there's an accordian....
[11:58:25] <Rushing> yeah, jqueryui isn't as "revolutionary" as jquery. it's just some OTB stuff that you can use if you want. it is handy on many sites just to have in the stack
[11:58:29] <systemfault> lathan: Love the one-liner :P
[11:58:36] <djQuery> think this alternate has allready been in use on the jquery conference site
[11:58:39] <lathan> ty @ systemfault
[11:58:55] <necromancer> erichynds: well when that happens, i'll take a look. :) but right now, it's completely useless to me. design always wins, and i've never encountered a design that looked even remotely like jQuery UI because that's not what gets approved. so i guess other people feel the same way about UI that i do (it's ugly)
[11:59:04] <lathan> you can add another line to make it close all the other accordians...and make the full (simple) functionality of accordian
[11:59:26] <Rushing> jqueryui would be really handy for a web-app that was designed _around_ it
[11:59:31] <necromancer> Rushing: it's also really big, and can slow down site loading times.
[11:59:36] <lathan> agreed, the UI default styles are only better than not having any css.....
[11:59:44] <necromancer> when i use UI stuff i cherry-pick the plugins/CSS i want
[11:59:47] <erichynds> necromancer: yeah. there is also an open source ariso theme for jquery ui, but I'm not sure how polished it looks
[11:59:50] <necromancer> thank god for the build tool
[11:59:55] <lathan> lol
[12:00:02] <Rushing> necromancer, most people have 5 images in a slideshow on their home page, each of which are larger than the library. its size is not my concern in the least lol
[12:00:22] <lathan> @build tool, luckily for me my boss will style it and build the css file. :P I just include it
[12:00:25] <systemfault> If google's CDN has a full jQueryUI file, it would be a good idea to use it, no?
[12:00:25] <lathan> I hate design
[12:00:31] <lathan> *style design
[12:00:35] <systemfault> I mean, it will likely be cached
[12:00:45] <necromancer> Rushing: haha well maybe it should be... :) every little bit counts
[12:00:50] <lathan> systemfault, google's script stuff is usually good like that
[12:00:55] <Rushing> systemfault, i prefer to keep my resources local. i don't like the api/local fallback thing
[12:01:05] <systemfault> Rushing: I understand :)
[12:01:09] <lathan> all my stuff is local as well....
[12:01:16] <lathan> but then you have the 2 loads per domain slowing down the page?
[12:01:19] <necromancer> systemfault: for development, yeah. but keeping it local is just more reliable
[12:01:42] <Rushing> this room is a black hole for time lol
[12:01:47] <systemfault> necromancer: Depends for who :P I trust google's CDN more than my hoster
[12:01:53] <necromancer> wow
[12:01:56] <necromancer> then you REALLY need to move hosts
[12:01:58] <necromancer> lol
[12:01:59] <Rushing> then change hosts lol.
[12:02:00] <systemfault> Haha
[12:02:05] <systemfault> Amazon? :/
[12:02:05] <necromancer> what are you on, godaddy?!?
[12:02:11] <Rushing> and if your host can't server js, it likely can't server the page html
[12:02:12] <necromancer> oh yeah, move now
[12:02:22] <necromancer> you're not supposed to host everything on amazon, that's retarded
[12:02:36] <necromancer> plus it's ultra expensive
[12:02:46] <systemfault> necromancer: It seemed like a good idea at the beginning..
[12:02:50] <necromancer> Rushing: amazon can host js
[12:03:00] <necromancer> actually it's funny...you can host an entire static site on S3 :)
[12:03:14] <necromancer> in that sense, i think it's a good idea because it's practically free hosting
[12:03:26] <lathan> Rushing, @black hole, yep!
[12:03:33] <Rushing> right, i'm just saying, if you're referencing remote resources cause you don't trust the local server with it, the html probably isn't even making it out, must less the js
[12:03:58] <necromancer> but hosting all your stuff on EC2 is really expensive and unnecessary. i'm still of the opinion that this "cloud" business is not to be trusted 100%. you always need a home base. that way, even if the whole EC2 network fails you're still good.
[12:04:06] <lathan> remember the good ol' days? 150m.com ?
[12:04:07] <necromancer> (which it has done, plenty of times before)
[12:04:11] <necromancer> haha lathan
[12:04:16] <Rushing> necromancer, seems to work pretty well for netflix ;)
[12:04:27] <unixbeard> Rushing: man, I'm frustrated.  I'm re-creating dialogs but the freshly inserted one in the dom node won't work.  Argh!  Any other suggestion to debug? :)
[12:04:28] <necromancer> Rushing: they still have a home base, iirc
[12:04:41] <larzen-wrk> Folks.. im trying to get today's date in JQ. i am doing Date.today() <-- tells me that today is not a function
[12:04:43] <larzen-wrk> any ideas?
[12:04:50] <lathan> I work at an academic organization, having your own dedicated bandwidth, servers, and server room is very nice :)
[12:05:12] <Rushing> larzen-wrk, probably because it's not ;)
[12:05:14] <lathan> larzen-wrk, jQuery does not reproduce native javascript events
[12:05:18] <Rushing> if you want the current date, just create a new date
[12:05:18] <lathan> ?mdc date @ larzen-wrk
[12:05:19] <bot-t> larzen-wrk, Date - MDC Docs - Creates Date instances which let you work with dates and times. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[12:05:21] <Rushing> var now = new Date()
[12:05:29] <lathan> ?ditto @ Rushing
[12:05:30] <bot-t> Rushing, I was going to say that...... :)
[12:05:52] <lathan> I love bot factoids :)
[12:06:04] <Rushing> unixbeard, i'd really have to see the probably in action to provide more insight
[12:06:22] <lathan> ?f
[12:06:23] <bot-t> lathan, "f" is for Format & WHAT THE diff?? | jQuery Plugins - Two incredibly useful extensions to JavaScript's Date Object for the price of one! http://plugins.jquery.com/project/fIsForFormat
[12:06:26] <lathan> oops
[12:06:27] <djQuery> lathan: I was disapointed in ui.accordion myself when I learned that it did not all multiples open. this seems that it should be something easily implimented. gues I have todays project.
[12:06:27] <Rushing> the problem*
[12:06:47] <lathan> djQuery, the multiple opening is not an "accordion" that's why
[12:07:01] <Rushing> djQuery, look at the docs page for it. it gives a very simple example of how to create your own
[12:07:02] <lathan> djQuery, by the definition of an accordion only 1 is open at once....
[12:07:15] <lathan> djQuery, and that @Rushing
[12:07:22] <larzen-wrk> here is what I am trying to do... var todayDate = new Date(); 	if (date == todayDate.today().next().thursday())
[12:07:39] <djQuery> lathan: yes but your 1 liner from earlier misses out on many of the aria features that are there in accordion
[12:07:49] <lathan> like?
[12:07:52] <lathan> (I'm curious)
[12:07:58] <Rushing> larzen-wrk, lol i'm not sure where you got that code but it is not built into js or jquery
[12:08:01] <larzen-wrk> ah.. its .now()!
[12:08:02] <lathan> been a while since I've dug into accordion
[12:08:29] <djQuery> active expaned etc
[12:08:41] <djQuery> search the src for aria
[12:08:43] <Rushing> you can't just go chaining methods for whatever day you want and expect it work, unless you have some other library in place
[12:08:48] <necromancer> ahaha
[12:08:57] <necromancer> "what do you think this is, ruby?!?"
[12:09:06] <lathan> lol
[12:09:13] <kborchers> necromancer :D
[12:09:20] <lathan> larzen-wrk, you don't need a jQuery doc, you need a doc about the Date object, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date#Methods_2
[12:09:23] <necromancer> i can't tell you how mant times i've said that here
[12:09:25] <necromancer> or in ##js
[12:09:34] <Rushing> this.make().code().work()
[12:09:39] <lathan> it always applies :) @ necromancer
[12:09:41] <Rushing> WHY ISNT IT WORKING
[12:09:58] <kborchers> Rushing you forgot $
[12:09:59] <larzen-wrk> lathan: sounds ot me .. like i need to it by hand!
[12:10:00] <kborchers> ;)
[12:10:04] <lathan> Do we really want to start making up fantasy code prototype sentences?
[12:10:05] <Rushing> doh
[12:10:23] <lathan> larzen-wrk, did you expect us to jQuery to read your mind and cover every possible use of the date?
[12:10:25] <djQuery> aria-expanded aria-selected
[12:10:32] <lathan> *us or jQuery
[12:10:52] <lathan> larzen-wrk, not doing it by hand, you are coding it by hand
[12:11:11] <lathan> larzen-wrk, doing it by hand would be hiring a bunch of people in India to do the calculation for you :)
[12:11:30] <lathan> (or doing it yourself for all your site visits)
[12:11:37] <Rushing> maybe we're being a bit harsh lol. larzen-wrk, if you need the date of next thursday, you'd need to do some math, but i'd go to the js room for that
[12:11:46] <lathan> yah, I'm being snippy
[12:11:52] <lathan> ?sorry
[12:11:52] <bot-t> http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldazu28sVD1qdqv28o1_500.gif
[12:11:54] <lathan> oops
[12:12:07] <lathan> lol @ the sorry image
[12:12:43] <lathan> Rushing, wait, there is s library that does all that kind of date manipulations
[12:12:48] <lathan> like jQuery for the calendar
[12:12:54] <lathan> don't remember its name though
[12:13:23] <Rushing> that's why i added the "unless you have another library in place" condition ;)
[12:13:46] <lathan> of course, I forgot the name of it :P
[12:13:56] <lathan> larzen-wrk, look at this page: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1025693/how-to-get-next-week-date-in-javascript
[12:14:31] <coreyf> @lathan +1 for using stack
[12:14:39] <coreyf> :)
[12:14:48] <lathan> oh come on, use the incriment operator: lathan++
[12:14:52] <lathan> (thanks!)
[12:15:06] <lathan> lathan +1 just looks tacky :P
[12:15:19] <lathan> ?eval "lathan" + 1
[12:15:19] <coreyf> youre tacky if you can't accept a compliment
[12:15:19] <bot-t> lathan: "lathan1"
[12:15:24] <coreyf> lol
[12:15:24] <lathan> haha
[12:15:44] <lathan> for some reason I'm in a worse mood
[12:15:49] <lathan> normally I'm quite jovial
[12:15:50] <Rushing> but getting next "thursday" is a bit more complicated than getting next week
[12:16:34] <lathan> getDay() = day of week [0 - 6]
[12:16:46] <unixbeard> Rushing: I have a pastebin :|
[12:16:53] <lathan> getDate() = day of month[1-31]

[12:18:27] <lathan> no
[12:18:28] <lathan> oops
[12:18:43] <coreyf> @lathan - #jquery channel should be a nice break from dealing with the monotony of retards in the work place all day though....so smile : )
[12:18:56] <lathan> ?eval var today = new Date(); var nextThursday = new Date(today.getFullYear(), today.getMonth(), today.getDate() - today.getDay() + 4  );

[12:19:20] <SkyFlyer> any one have anything that i can make a drop down select box replace the select items with Images vs. text ???
[12:19:23] <lathan> well that didn't work
[12:19:39] <lathan> image in a select menu?
[12:19:54] <SkyFlyer> yeah
[12:19:57] <coreyf> @SkyFlyer - I don't know if that's even possible
[12:20:08] <SkyFlyer> just did a google search.. here is what i found..  http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/dropdown?page=3
[12:20:14] <coreyf> lol
[12:20:22] <djQuery> SkyFlyer: either append a <img> to each option
[12:20:39] <orolo> in .hover(), how do i make sure the hoverOut function fires? when i clickly move the mouse to an adjacent :hover block, the hoverIn doesn't fire.
[12:20:59] <coreyf> @SkyFlyer: so why not use the DropDown plugin that you found?
[12:21:55] <lathan> larzen-wrk, here: var today = new Date(); var nextThursday = new Date(today.getFullYear(), today.getMonth(), today.getDate() - today.getDay() + 4 +7 ); nextThursday
[12:22:00] <Rushing> Next thursday: http://jsfiddle.net/QEAZw/

[12:22:03] <necromancer> anyone here use jquery.validate? do the errorClass/errorContainer/etc. properties override the invalidHandler callback?
[12:22:06] <kborchers> SkyFlyer: check this out. http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/jquery_ui_selectmenu_an_aria_accessible_plugin_for_styling_a_html_select/ this is currently being implemented in UI for a future release http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu
[12:22:09] <SkyFlyer> yeah, going to try it.
[12:22:39] <SkyFlyer> wow, those are awesome!!!
[12:22:43] <kborchers> ;)
[12:22:55] <lathan> Rushing, not as pretty, but: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/9nwGj/
[12:22:59] <SkyFlyer> the future is so bright i have to wear shades
[12:23:26] <lathan> Rushing, same mathematical concept
[12:23:39] <Rushing> yeah, we win
[12:23:43] <sadmicrowave> can someone ping me so I can see how xchat handles ping notifications
[12:24:38] <joshteam> Anyone see something dramatically wrong with -> http://jsfiddle.net/DzfA3/ ?
[12:25:33] <danstever> hey everyone, i'm having a killer problem with IE8. Every time I load a jQuery plugin it crashes the browser. IE8 only. Any ideas?
[12:25:53] <Rushing> unixbeard, line 2 is destroying all dialogs that start with the given id, then line 7 recreates all of them. that's rather unwieldy
[12:26:18] <Rushing> i'd say you need to examine your order of operations. you should only create the dialogs on each box once, then you should have a trigger that opens the relevant dialog
[12:26:40] <unixbeard> Rushing, you can disregard that.  I was trying to make the new dialog open.
[12:27:07] <unixbeard> I also tried another function to only create that specific dialog (details_dialog_whatever).  Same results.
[12:28:31] <Tobsn> hey, does anyone use jquery template? i want to pass in a variable into tmpl('tpl', data, {foo:123} ); and use foo within a {{each}} and i cant seem to access it...
[12:29:16] <Rushing> unixbeard, it's too much code for me to pick apart right now, but i'd say it's because you're doing something wrong ;P
[12:29:31] <lathan> danstever, no idea, I hate all versions of IE, and the debugging involved therein
[12:29:47] <Rushing> i'd be doing quite a bit differently in this code
[12:30:00] <sadmicrowave> @kborchers - thanks
[12:30:03] <kborchers> ?demo @ danstever
[12:30:04] <bot-t> danstever, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:30:31] <djQuery> danstever: but seeing as how there are hundreds of people using jquery and thousands using ie8 think this woulda come up before if it werent something stricty with ur enviro
[12:30:42] <unixbeard> Rushing: Yeah, no doubt I am doing something wrong.  I went ahead and created another function to specifically handle the newly added dialog.
[12:30:53] <lathan> joshteam, I'm getting this error: Uncaught Invalid dimensions for plot, width = 566, height = 0
[12:30:57] <unixbeard> Rushing: note, the existing dialogs work /fine/, it's the new one added to the dom node.
[12:31:12] <lathan> joshteam, check the paramters to send to it, do you need to give it a height?
[12:31:13] <sadmicrowave> @sadmicrowave
[12:31:14] <djQuery> unixbeard: gota link
[12:31:17] <unixbeard> Also the click event binding to the new edit button added to the dom works.  It's just the dialog acts like it's not initialized.
[12:31:25] <danstever> @kborchers @djQuery @bot-t hey guys, here is my post at stackoverflow... http://bit.ly/jBxibY
[12:31:28] <unixbeard> djQuery, I'll do another pastebin in a sec.  The old one expired.

[12:32:07] <bot-t> unixbeard, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:32:29] <joshteam> got it, you were right lathan
[12:32:30] <djQuery> a working demo would go a lot further in helping us recreate the issue
[12:32:58] <lathan> joshteam, it is nice when your guess without any knowledge of the plugin is right.....
[12:33:10] <lathan> joshteam, find someway to look at an error console next time
[12:33:16] <joshteam> lathan: yes.. yes it is; especially for me :)
[12:33:18] <joshteam> 10-4
[12:33:21] <danstever> @djQuery there is a link included in that post, however here it is, http://bit.ly/kXckQF
[12:33:29] <lathan> error consoles are your friend!
[12:34:18] <lathan> joshteam, just for curiosity sake, could you save that updated version on fiddle? (wondering what that plot would look like)
[12:34:27] <danstever> @djQuery I'm sorry, Click through that link then onto any of the team member's pages
[12:34:32] <joshteam> lathan: yeah
[12:35:19] <djQuery> danstever: well it works in ie9 even when I put it in ie7/8 mode
[12:35:47] <danstever> djQuery: Yeah. I get it to work like that too.
[12:36:19] <djQuery> danstever: sorry dont have a true ie8 machine to use
[12:36:31] <sadmicrowave> I like how ape-server claims to have an active channel but the last activity is from March and it was by me
[12:36:58] <danstever> djQuery: i had to steal one. The exact same thing is happening with the IE8 browser in IE Tester
[12:37:20] <joshteam> lathan: http://jsfiddle.net/DzfA3/3/
[12:38:02] <lathan> joshteam, not bad.... have you seen Google's chart apis?
[12:38:24] <joshteam> lathan: yeah - they are nice too
[12:38:32] <sadmicrowave> @joshteam - I saw some cool graph stuff using the raphael framework (haven't tried it out though).  Here it is: http://g.raphaeljs.com/
[12:39:08] <sadmicrowave> @joshteam - I saw some cool graph stuff using the raphael framework (haven't tried it out though).  Here it is: http://g.raphaeljs.com/ interactive graphs and charts and such...
[12:42:34] <sadmicrowave> no one? nothing to add about raphael? hmm...
[12:42:47] <lathan> ...lol
[12:45:28] <tbranyen> sadmicrowave: the project is dead?
[12:46:15] <djQuery> sadmicrowave: sure plenty of people have something to say about it in the #raphael channel
[12:47:28] <lathan> kindof like people coming here and saying the #php channel is dead, anyone want to help?
[12:47:38] <lathan> to be blunt: "No"
[12:48:18] <Tobsn> http://jsfiddle.net/rRtAq/4178/ <- jquery template example
[12:49:44] <djQuery> damn 4178 edits? been at it awhile tobsn
[12:49:52] <Tobsn> lol no
[12:49:58] <Tobsn> i used an example
[12:50:10] <Tobsn> and accidently forgot to fork etc.
[12:50:19] <Tobsn> like 4100 something before me hehe
[12:51:23] <djQuery> u might wanna use the one from the git instead of the old ms one
[12:52:55] <lathan> Tobsn, is this a lot of other people working on it? you don't have to save to run it again......
[12:53:16] <Tobsn> yeah, i think thats the first time i actually used jsfiddle
[12:53:26] <Tobsn> never had such a problem that needed further examples ;)
[13:00:50] <lathan> Tobsn, lol
[13:01:09] <lathan> my fiddles don't usually last the day....I forget about them @ Tobsn
[13:01:24] <Tobsn> hehe
[13:01:25] <Tobsn> yeah
[13:01:31] <Tobsn> nah i really cant figure it out
[13:01:44] <Tobsn> already opened an issue on github about it
[13:01:51] <Tobsn> i cant seem to get the passed in variable inside the each scope
[13:02:02] <Tobsn> well i think i can get it into the each but not within the function call
[13:02:53] <knapper_tech> what's the most succinct way to write an if statement for an identifier?
[13:03:15] <Rushing> what kind of identifier? an element id?
[13:03:20] <knapper_tech> ie $('#foo') is on the page
[13:03:32] <knapper_tech> id="foo" is on the page
[13:03:40] <Rushing> if($("#foo").length){...}
[13:03:49] <Rushing> is most succinct
[13:03:56] <knapper_tech> aight
[13:04:11] <Rushing> but i generally prefer... var $foo = $("#foo"); if($foo.length){...}
[13:04:23] <Rushing> just don't like to query for the same element twice
[13:04:55] <ryanneufeld> knapper_tech: what Rushing is suggesting is called caching
[13:05:13] <ryanneufeld> and if you're going to use $("#foo") more than once, then it's a good idea
[13:05:14] <Rushing> not really lol, but i guess you could call it that
[13:05:27] <ryanneufeld> Rushing: it's commonly called caching
[13:05:33] <Rushing> ok, fair enough ;)
[13:05:41] <Tobsn> just if( $('#foo') ) should be enough right?
[13:05:46] <Kambfhase> no
[13:05:54] <Rushing> no, $() will always return true, becuase it's an object
[13:05:57] <Kambfhase> sechs, setzen
[13:05:58] <Tobsn> ah okay
[13:06:04] <Rushing> er, $(..) will always return an object, so it's always true
[13:06:09] <Tobsn> never actually tried an if on a selector ;)
[13:06:39] <sadmicrowave> if( $("#foo").length > 0 ) should work though right?
[13:07:00] <Rushing> yes, but he asked for the most succinct way
[13:07:19] <Rushing> .length > 0 or .length === 0 are "most" correct
[13:07:37] <Kambfhase> $("#foo").is("#foo") works too, expect some times ...
[13:08:03] <Rushing> that's much more intensive
[13:08:04] <ajpiano> just .length is equally correct
[13:08:19] <ajpiano> the fact that 0 and 1 or truthy doesn't make it cheating
[13:08:20] <ajpiano> :p
[13:08:32] <Rushing> roger
[13:08:39] <progrock> wow, lol... that tooks ome effort... jsut wrapped jquery bbq with an sbtraction object that now conveniently sets and triggers events when individual values change in the url
[13:09:05] <lathan> if($('#foo').get(0)) might work
[13:09:07] <Rushing> i imagine you dealth with a few typo bugs in that process? :P
[13:09:10] <progrock> also gets rid of the isseu that there eneds to be a pause for the hash to change
[13:09:14] <Rushing> doh! dealt*
[13:09:19] <lathan> hah!
[13:09:20] <progrock> haha, of course
[13:11:30] <progrock> I will set using __defineGetter__ and __defienSetter__ took a minute to get used to.. never tried prototyping an override for them
[13:11:33] <progrock> say*
[13:12:54] <Kambfhase> that api is outdated
[13:13:27] <progrock> I noticed.. was very close to jsut rewriting a similar functionality myself
[13:14:00] <Kambfhase> why not use Object.define Property?
[13:14:37] <progrock> umm, what exactly do you mean?
[13:14:57] <Kambfhase> ES5
[13:15:00] <tbranyen> Object.defineProperty is new
[13:15:21] <progrock> whats useful with it thats diferent from prototyping?
[13:15:25] <Kambfhase> "new"
[13:16:23] <Kambfhase> Object.defineProperty is stndardized and works in Chrome tec, __defineGetter__ does not
[13:16:54] <progrock> well the way I'm doign getter/setter works fine in chrome
[13:17:30] <progrock> using Resig's example here: http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-getters-and-setters/    the one that prorotypers get value()
[13:17:59] <lathan> javascript allows getters / settings to be set? oh dear, meaning you could actually write with the OO paradigm
[13:18:00] <Kambfhase> uh, ok hahha.
[13:19:24] <Rushing> doesn't work in IE, of course, so it's only a good learning tutorial
[13:19:39] <progrock> no, we don't support IE anyway
[13:19:45] <progrock> at least not untill SVG support is elgit
[13:20:09] <Kambfhase> There is a nice getter/setter api by giammarchi using jQuery like style
[13:20:21] <Rushing> no ie support?! wow that'd be nice
[13:20:23] <Kambfhase> which also works in IE
[13:20:46] <Rushing> i've NEVER worked with a client or for a company that doesn't require ie support
[13:20:55] <kborchers> progrock: how can you not support that large of a group of users?
[13:21:07] <Rushing> i'd just stick with the .getWhatever .setWhatever methods for now
[13:21:14] <lathan> kborchers, that group is shrinking......
[13:21:15] <Rushing> we'll be supporing IE8 for another 10yrs
[13:21:20] <Kambfhase> lathan: doing OOP in javascript is not that hard
[13:21:21] <lathan> ouch
[13:21:22] <kborchers> it is but still 25%
[13:21:46] <lathan> Kambfhase, I just haven't gotten into it. haven't done anything that should really use it
[13:21:57] <progrock> kborchers: becasue our app has very specific clietns that agree to use firefox when signign with us
[13:22:06] <lathan> just because you can use OO doesn't mean it should be done that way.....
[13:22:09] <Rushing> lathan, it's generally the larger clients that are sticklers about IE support. the lower level clients aren't as much sticklers, just that they use whatever came installed on their computer...IE
[13:22:17] <lathan> yah
[13:22:25] <ch3mical> Man, people in #httpd are childish dimwits
[13:22:32] <progrock> Rushing: this is absolutely not whast prevent us from supporting IE.. fi it was, I would.. but I have no ened to support IE, so my life is that much better
[13:22:34] <ch3mical> Well, one specific person, anyway
[13:22:35] * kborchers is dreaming of a life where he doesn't support IE
[13:22:47] * lathan shouts hallelujah @ kborchers' dream
[13:23:03] * lathan wakes up now screaming for what he lost!
[13:23:22] <Rushing> i'm not sure what "this" is, but i was just saying in general...it'd be nice not to have to. every site i've ever created has had to be ie compliant
[13:23:33] <kborchers> and lathan's screaming interrupted my dream. come on man!!! ;)
[13:23:35] <lathan> ch3mical, I'm going to refrain from any snobby jokes about helping people do "html"
[13:23:39] <lathan> ?sry
[13:23:43] <bot-t> lathan, max | jQuery Plugins - /* * jQuery.fn.maxSize( options / number ); * * Put maxsize on images * * $('.element').maxSize({ * width: 'maxWidth', * height: 'maxHeight' * }); * * Version 1.0.0 * www.labs.skengdon.com/maxSize ... http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/max
[13:23:45] <Rushing> thank got ie6 is fading, but ie7 is filling the gap pretty easily
[13:23:46] <lathan> ?sorry @ kborchers
[13:23:47] <bot-t> kborchers, http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldazu28sVD1qdqv28o1_500.gif
[13:23:52] <kborchers> i love that one
[13:23:58] <lathan> yep
[13:24:33] <lathan> oh-uh, "Hmm, bot-t.com isn't loading right now."
[13:24:53] <ajpiano> bot-t.com is long since borked :(
[13:24:54] <fabiobik> how to select an div knowing only the class inside?
[13:24:57] <kborchers> it has been down for a while
[13:25:08] <ajpiano> fabiobik $(".foo").closest("div")
[13:25:28] <fabiobik> <ajpiano thank you
[13:25:43] <progrock> Rushing: yeah, this is the first time I didn't have to support IE (I'm suaully very good at it at least).. tis amazing.. I can actually fuck arouund with some of the newer browser features... much more interesting
[13:25:45] <ch3mical> lathan: what is that supposed to mean?
[13:26:03] <lathan> ch3mical, I think that working with javascript libraries is a "higher calling" than working with plain html
[13:26:14] <Rushing> yeah, that's dreamy...
[13:26:17] <ch3mical> I was talking about #httpd (apache server)
[13:26:20] <lathan> oh
[13:26:21] <lathan> oops
[13:26:25] <lathan> nvmind
[13:26:30] <ch3mical> But yeah, still that logic applies
[13:26:33] <ch3mical> ;)
[13:26:44] <lathan> no, don't hit on the apache gurus
[13:26:47] <Rushing> html is way harder than js
[13:26:48] <Rushing> it's got like
[13:26:50] <Rushing> closing tags
[13:26:51] <lathan> hah
[13:26:52] <Rushing> and opening tags
[13:26:53] <lathan> haha
[13:26:54] <Rushing> and uhm
[13:26:57] <lathan> and self-closing tags
[13:27:00] <Rushing> yeah.
[13:27:06] <Rushing> all KINDS of stuff
[13:27:10] <lathan> and people who use <p> as a <br /><br />
[13:27:15] <sadmicrowave> @ajpiano - .closest() goes up through the DOM structure, not down.  @fabiobik only knows the class inside an element
[13:27:30] <lathan> ?:has @ sadmicrowave, fabiobik
[13:27:31] <bot-t> lathan, Couldn't find ":has @ sadmicrowave, fabiobik" in jQuery Docs.
[13:27:36] <lathan> ?:has @ sadmicrowave
[13:27:36] <bot-t> sadmicrowave, :has(selector): Selects elements which contain at least one element that matches the specified selector. http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/
[13:27:44] <lathan> ?:has @ fabiobik
[13:27:44] <bot-t> fabiobik, :has(selector): Selects elements which contain at least one element that matches the specified selector. http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/
[13:27:49] <ajpiano> sadmicrowave, yah, and he knows the class inside, and wants to get the div outside of it, closest would work
[13:27:52] <ch3mical> Anyway, I went in there and asked why my htaccess was not being read. Turns out it wasn't set in the server conf, so this guy said to look for apache2.conf. I told him that "find / -name apache*" found nothing
[13:27:54] <ajpiano> :has will also work
[13:28:03] <lathan> ajpiano, closest seems better
[13:28:11] <lathan> as has has to search all the children
[13:28:11] <ch3mical> So he told me to look at some website that tells me how to find it for specific linux distros
[13:28:15] <lathan> while closest just searches parents
[13:28:21] <ajpiano> yah, performs better
[13:28:24] <ch3mical> I explained to him that if that find command didn't see it, it doesn't exist
[13:28:25] <ch3mical> lol
[13:28:26] <ajpiano> fo sho
[13:28:32] <ch3mical> So he threw a fit and banned me
[13:28:34] <lathan> lol @ ch3mical
[13:28:46] <lathan> now, that isn't true for 'locate'
[13:28:47] <sadmicrowave> @ajpiano, yea I was confused, sorry
[13:28:47] <ch3mical> Infantile
[13:29:01] <ch3mical> locate uses a cached database of the filesystem
[13:29:05] <lathan> I know
[13:29:08] <ch3mical> find actually does an active search
[13:29:11] <lathan> I know
[13:29:18] <lathan> I run linux on my personal machine
[13:29:19] <ch3mical> The distro I'm working with doesn't use locate
[13:29:23] <lathan> fun
[13:29:26] <ch3mical> It's an embeded distro
[13:29:32] <lathan> I hate those things!
[13:29:36] <ch3mical> I don't
[13:29:38] <lathan> like half-linux
[13:29:47] <ch3mical> I'm working with a GuruPlug Server
[13:29:55] <ch3mical> I like challenges
[13:29:58] <lathan> I'm biased because my embedded linux is my android phone.....
[13:30:06] <lathan> the keyboard just wasn't made for bash
[13:30:08] <ch3mical> And I have a great deal of experience with embedded systems
[13:30:14] <Kambfhase> I am working on windows. call that a challenge!
[13:30:25] <lathan> ch3mical, embedded, including microprocessors?
[13:30:43] <ch3mical> Windows is definitely a challenge... lol
[13:30:46] <ch3mical> lathan: yeah :)
[13:31:03] <lathan> those were fun
[13:31:14] <lathan> I took a class entitled that last year.
[13:31:31] <lathan> the best time was how liberating programming in C was compared to assembly :)
[13:31:32] <ch3mical> Cool
[13:31:39] <ch3mical> lol yeah
[13:33:12] <ch3mical> Anyway, back to work, thanks for letting me vent :P
[13:34:48] <juha___> may the midsummer hacking commence
[13:35:11] <progrock> thast interesting, I jsut changed my get/set code to the defineProperty style... no JS errors, but definitely not functioning, oh well
[13:35:18] <ryanneufeld> ch3mical: did you look for httpd.conf?
[13:35:34] <Kambfhase> ?p @ progrock
[13:35:34] <bot-t> progrock, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:35:39] <ryanneufeld> ch3mical: and run your find as root?
[13:35:44] <ch3mical> ryanneufeld: yeah, I got it solved, I was just venting at the childishness of the guy in #httpd
[13:36:00] <stalecache> tried my hand at some harmless "click jacking": www.funnyemperortamarins.com ... any link click "like"s the site if your signed on facebook
[13:36:01] <ryanneufeld> ch3mical: spend some timein ##php :p
[13:36:32] <lathan> ?np @ ch3mical
[13:36:32] <bot-t> ch3mical, No Problem
[13:36:33] <ch3mical> ryanneufeld: single-user mode device, so yeah I'm root. Turns out the thing is running lighttpd anyway (should have guessed anyway)
[13:36:52] <ryanneufeld> ch3mical: that explains why the htaccess is being ignored :P
[13:37:02] <ch3mical> ryanneufeld: I try to stay away from #php as much as possible ;p
[13:37:27] <progrock> here's all that I can post of the code: http://jsfiddle.net/R7xMQ/
[13:37:30] <ryanneufeld> ch3mical: I like a good laugh, so I watch it in my logs, but this channel is much friendlier to n00bs
[13:37:39] <ch3mical> ryanneufeld: lol yeah... I'm working on about an hour of sleep after a night of heavy drinking with everyone from work last night
[13:37:54] <ch3mical> ryanneufeld: so I'm a bit handicapped at the moment ^_^
[13:37:55] <ryanneufeld> and I'm sure that helps :P
[13:39:30] <Kambfhase> progrock: try http://jsfiddle.net/R7xMQ/1/
[13:40:47] <progrock> Kambfhase: hmm, well I see what your getting at, but I'm trying to do it on the value hashwatch.Key.value.. not on key alone (tho I might be ale to amek that work)
[13:41:19] <Kambfhase> kk
[13:47:06] <progrock> Oh well, gues I'll jsut revert back to what was wokring
[13:47:39] <lathan> can you use a comparison program? @ progrock
[13:47:45] <lathan> is this in a revisioned repository?
[13:48:32] <progrock> of course.. thats not a problem.. I was just trying to use Object.defineProperty instead of prototype get/set value()
[13:49:45] <progrock> oh sweet
[13:49:46] <progrock> I think i got it
[13:50:20] <DimmuR> Hello everyone. Is there any easy way to put , as thousand separator in a row of table?
[13:50:35] <progrock> I jsut put it inside the hashwatch.Key object defiinition and did it on 'this' isnetad of hashwatch.Key
[13:51:31] <kborchers> DimmuR: not sure what you mean. can you rephrase?
[13:51:46] <Boudga> is it possible to use $.get for cross domain requests if you dont require a response?
[13:52:31] <DimmuR> kborchers, i want to automaticly switch 1000000 into 1,000,000 etc
[13:52:52] <Rushing> DimmuR, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/149055/how-can-i-format-numbers-as-money-in-javascript
[13:53:04] <DimmuR> thanks
[13:53:10] <Rushing> use the answer with Number.prototype.formatMoney
[13:53:38] <kborchers> DimmuR ^^^
[13:54:05] <Rushing> and in jquery, you'd do something like $("table.whatever td.cost").each(function(){ $(this).html( Number.format($(this).html()); });
[13:54:59] <progrock> DimmuR: I have an addcommas fucntion if you want (proabbyl similar to whats there)
[13:55:07] <Rushing> don't use that exactly. the method is not Number.format, but hopefully that gets your started
[13:55:19] <progrock> DimmuR: http://jsfiddle.net/rqhTy/
[13:55:31] <jmwpc> hello, I'm trying to see if there is a way to bind to some event/function or a 3rd party widget. It's the ResellerRatings exit survey, I just want to nudge it down the page a bit so part of our receipt is not covered. I have done it successfully in the $(document)ready but the widget also has a moveTo function. Right now, the one that fires last is the one that wins. Here's the code for the widget http://pastebin.com/g9EHxeQg
[13:56:05] <lathan> ?mdc Number.prototype.formatMoney @ lathan

[13:56:48] <knapper_tech> can i FIFO with an array?    opposite of pop
[13:56:51] <sykopomp> well... it was worth a shot.
[13:57:33] <lathan> Rushing, I can't find that number class in javascript
[13:57:46] <lathan> DimmuR, Rushing this function works, however: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2646385/add-a-thousands-separator-to-a-total-with-javascript-or-jquery
[13:57:49] <kborchers> knapper_tech: shift
[13:58:12] <jmwpc> I should have noted that the widget's moveTo function is called as part of the open function
[13:58:17] <kborchers> knapper_tech: http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1796-Javascript-Array-Methods-Unshift-Shift-Push-And-Pop-.htm
[13:58:23] <lathan> sykopomp, printmoney isn't there, because that would be counterfitting. :P
[13:58:35] <lathan> ?mdc shift @ knapper_tech
[13:58:36] <bot-t> knapper_tech, shift - MDC Docs - Removes the first element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift
[13:58:54] <lathan> kborchers, use ?mdc search powered by bot-t for native javscript functions

[13:58:55] <sykopomp> lathan: ;D
[13:59:21] <lathan> lol
[13:59:45] <kborchers> lathan: i know but i like ben nadel's full explanation of the use of push pop shift and unshift. helps those who don't understand to see them compared
[14:00:02] <lathan> ah
[14:05:31] <lucenut> Hi, I'm using jquery form validation and would like to validate that a selectbox start_time is before the select end_time.
[14:06:00] <lucenut> I currently only have 4 required rules in my validate function.
[14:06:35] <DynamicFail> I want a way to have a webpage hosted on my local apache2 server where the user can press a button and they will be able to see a rtp/rtsp/udp video stream in the browser (h264 or mpeg2)
[14:07:06] <progrock> (new Date($('#start_time').val())).getTime() < (new Date($('#end_time').val())).getTime()
[14:07:29] <progrock> or is you used ms as the values on the options, you coul;d jsut directly compare
[14:07:44] <necromancer> how the hell do i make jQuery.validate change the label color of an invalid input field??
[14:07:51] <necromancer> this has been fucking me up ALL day
[14:08:10] <lathan> necromancer, as in the css color of the .error class/
[14:08:15] <progrock> $('#inputId').css('background-color', 'red');
[14:08:24] <kborchers> necromancer: i believe it's the error class in the css
[14:08:27] <lathan> progrock, this is with validation forums.....
[14:08:27] <thomedy> i don't know why i can only animate effectively once a weeks
[14:08:33] <lathan> lol
[14:08:44] <necromancer> lathan / kborchers: no i mean for every input that has the .error class, i want to find its respective label and change THAT to a different color
[14:08:51] <progrock> lathan: so? if naythign it should be easier...
[14:09:07] <lathan> necromancer, still sounds like css
[14:09:14] <devinrolsen> $('.error).prev('label').css(...);
[14:09:15] <kborchers> $(".error").css("color", new_color);
[14:09:18] <lathan> (if the html is framed nicely
[14:09:19] <lathan> )
[14:09:28] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/krmKb/
[14:09:34] <lathan> necromancer, .error ~ label { color: ... }
[14:09:39] <lathan> oh wait...~ isn't supported....
[14:09:40] <necromancer> lathan: yeah it's CSS
[14:09:45] <necromancer> lol what is "~"?
[14:09:46] <thomedy> my scroll worked last night
[14:09:53] <lathan> ?css sibling
[14:09:53] <necromancer> lathan: that's not my problem though
[14:09:56] <bot-t> lathan, #7277 (CSS sibling selectors not working) ñ jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 8 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7277
[14:09:57] <thomedy> andi assumed i would be able to duplicate it
[14:10:12] <necromancer> lathan: my problem is that i can't select the elements whose labels need the style
[14:10:14] <necromancer> =\
[14:10:24] <lathan> necromancer, a ~ b says find an element "b" that is a sibling to "a"
[14:10:33] <necromancer> why would you need that?
[14:10:35] <necromancer> just do a b
[14:10:49] <lathan> "a b" is element b is a child of "a"
[14:10:50] <devinrolsen> but his input should not be a child of label (I mean unless you are trying to do inline radios)
[14:10:53] <lathan> this is siblings
[14:10:57] <necromancer> oh yeah
[14:10:57] <lathan> not descendants
[14:10:58] <blindMoe> necromancer: sometimes people just want the siblings :)
[14:11:01] <lathan> lol
[14:11:27] <lucenut> Progrock does that script you posted go in my "rules"?
[14:11:36] <necromancer> my issue is with jQuery.validate and finding the proper way of doing this shit
[14:11:39] <thomedy> okay im stumped
[14:11:56] <thomedy> if somebody wouldn't mind looking at my animate() function and then let me know why im retarded
[14:11:58] <lucenut> The dates are select boxes with name/id of start_time/end_time
[14:12:01] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/krmKb/
[14:12:09] <kborchers> necromancer: do the labels wrap the elements or do they use for="id"? i can't remember how the plugin does it.
[14:12:45] <necromancer> kborchers: the plugin creates errors with <label> tags, but i also have <label for="field"> to store the actual labels of the form fields
[14:12:57] <lathan> necromancer, you doing this with jQuery, instead of CSS?
[14:12:59] <necromancer> although i just extract the .html() out of the <label> as its created
[14:13:12] <lathan> necromancer, is the html structure such that you can't do it in css?
[14:13:13] <Tobsn> http://jsfiddle.net/rRtAq/4178/ <- jquery template problem "foo" doesnt get passed into the each - if anyone has an idea... :/
[14:13:23] <lathan> necromancer, it seems like css was made for this
[14:13:26] <thomedy> okay i figured it out i forgot to include my jqueryjs
[14:13:29] <necromancer> lathan: no not at all, i just thought i needed a callback from jQuery.validate
[14:13:33] <thomedy> simple and thats why im retarded thank you
[14:13:37] <vacho> http://pastebin.com/hykSvhUQ
[14:13:38] <lathan> ?np @ thomedy
[14:13:39] <bot-t> thomedy, No Problem
[14:13:40] <vacho> why is that not working? http://pastebin.com/hykSvhUQ
[14:13:41] <necromancer> lathan: the issue is that how is CSS going to know when a field is invalid?
[14:13:49] <progrock> lucenut: not sure how the validate shit works.. btu thats the direct code you would need to compare two date dropdowns with any values that can be converted to Date objects
[14:13:53] <vacho> http://pastebin.com/hykSvhUQ how do I reference my V variable?
[14:13:55] <lathan> necromancer, doesn't the validate routine put a error class on the input
[14:13:58] <necromancer> it does
[14:14:03] <lathan> then you use that....
[14:14:11] <thomedy> yep everythings good now
[14:14:22] <lathan> necromancer, ah, fiddle?
[14:14:27] <necromancer> lathan: i don't know if i can use attribute selectors in my CSS though, IE 7+ compatibility is part of this project requirements
[14:14:30] <Boudga> so if I dont want a response can I still use $.get to make a request?
[14:14:44] <necromancer> like how would i even select that in CSS?
[14:14:49] <lathan> necromancer, I can't help w/out knowing your html structure
[14:14:49] <Boudga> cross domain that is
[14:14:58] <lathan> Boudga, negative
[14:15:03] <Boudga> rats
[14:15:06] <lathan> ?jsonp @ Boudga
[14:15:06] <bot-t> Boudga, JSONP, Quickly ¬´ plaintext - http://niryariv.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/jsonp-quickly/ , What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/ - set the dataType for .ajax() to 'jsonp' if using .getJSON() see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/#jsonp
[14:15:23] <devinrolsen> vacho try this http://pastebin.com/SK66sBtd
[14:15:47] <lathan> jsonp turns your get request into jquery putting a script tag. your server has to handle it (but sending a javascript function that returns the data)
[14:15:49] <devinrolsen> you seem to have not properly quoted your attribute no escaped the variable v.
[14:16:18] <Matth1a3> does anyone know if I can replace a jQuery navigation menu with a CSS one when a page is opened in IE8? I have a jQuery navigation that works in all the browsers except for IE8...
[14:16:24] <ajpiano> necromancer: [attr=value] works in ie7
[14:16:43] <necromancer> lathan: http://jsfiddle.net/aUj4m/
[14:16:55] <necromancer> ajpiano: oh cool, good to know
[14:17:04] <vacho> devinrolsen, is that good coding practice?
[14:17:25] <devinrolsen> so not call your variable out like a string?
[14:17:26] <devinrolsen> yes
[14:17:32] <necromancer> ajpiano: i'm confused as to how i'd select the <label for="field"> of <input name="field"> with solely CSS...
[14:17:49] <necromancer> input[name=field] would select the <input>
[14:18:07] <necromancer> label[for=field] works but it's field-by-field, i need something that selects an entire class of fields called .error
[14:18:12] <vacho> why do I get ReferenceError: remove_select_duplicate is not defined even though the function is there?
[14:18:37] <ajpiano> label.error[for[
[14:18:41] <ajpiano> for]
[14:18:51] <necromancer> i wish there was a for/label selector that would relay to the <label> of the .error element
[14:19:04] <necromancer> ajpiano: wouldn't that require a <label> with class="error"?
[14:19:04] <kborchers> necromancer: how about this, not only css but ... http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/BFuuF/
[14:19:11] <ajpiano> isn't that what you said you had
[14:19:19] <devinrolsen> vacho, is the function declared prior to you using it?
[14:19:23] <vacho> YES
[14:19:24] <vacho> yes
[14:19:29] <vacho> I am running it rhough console even
[14:19:46] <necromancer> ajpiano: no i have an <input> with class="error", sorry if i confused
[14:21:12] <lathan> ajpiano, the label is the parent of the input.error
[14:21:24] <lathan> ajpiano, lovely css doesn't have a "parent" selector, or a :has
[14:21:38] <lathan> necromancer, does your validation plugin have callbacks for after a field is validated?
[14:21:54] <pr0ton> how do i parse json in jquery?
[14:21:57] <Axcy> http://akhalsa.com/test/ - Is there any way I can make the conditional fields show right away in IE, as it does in firefox?
[14:22:16] <necromancer> lathan: yeah invalidHandler, but it doesn't seem to be finding any <input> tags with .error, even though i see them in DOM
[14:22:25] <necromancer> lathan: i'm using jQuery.validate btw
[14:22:25] <Axcy> In firefox once I press "Yes" on the radio button the next field appears, but in IE i have to press somewhere for it to appear
[14:22:38] <lathan> necromancer, well, scratch the css idea, that's where you should be looking
[14:22:48] <necromancer> pr0ton: same way you do it in regular javascript
[14:23:02] <lathan> necromancer, do console.log(arguments) in that callback, see if it gives you a list of fields it validated as bad
[14:23:02] <pr0ton> necromancer, and how is that?
[14:23:17] <lathan> necromancer, the invalidHandler could be running before the .error class is added
[14:23:30] <necromancer> lathan: that's what i'm afraid of
[14:23:33] <lathan> JSON.toString
[14:23:34] <kborchers> necromancer: was my code any help? you could use it in the invalidHandler
[14:23:46] <necromancer> pr0ton: what lathan said :)
[14:24:01] <devinrolsen> vacho - http://jsfiddle.net/VsJ82/ it should be working, here is a example I whipped up.
[14:24:06] <pr0ton> necromancer, ?
[14:24:08] <necromancer> kborchers: nope
[14:24:13] <pr0ton> '{"labels": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], "points": ["10000", "10022", "10047", "10032", "10020", "10045", "10015", "9996", "10011", "10005"]}'
[14:24:16] <pr0ton> is this valid json?
[14:24:20] <necromancer> pr0ton: jsonlint.com
[14:24:29] <necromancer> (looks valid to me btw)
[14:24:34] <pr0ton> ok, it's valid
[14:24:36] <necromancer> JSON is just a JS object
[14:24:39] <necromancer> hence the name
[14:24:43] <necromancer> JavaScript Object Notation
[14:24:43] <pr0ton> yeah so anyway, i get this json response from a ajax request
[14:25:00] <pr0ton> on the servertype, i send the mimetype as application/json
[14:25:00] <lathan> pr0ton, do $.getJSON
[14:25:12] <pr0ton> $.getJSON does the ajax request?
[14:25:15] <necromancer> yep
[14:25:20] <pr0ton> yeah
[14:25:22] <lathan> pr0ton, or set the datatype: 'JSON' and then jQuery will call the parsing for you
[14:25:31] <necromancer> it's an alias for $.ajax({dataType: 'json'..
[14:25:36] <lathan> $.getJSON == ^^
[14:25:39] <lathan> ?ditto @ necromancer
[14:25:39] <bot-t> necromancer, I was going to say that...... :)
[14:25:44] <necromancer> hah
[14:25:49] <lathan> hehe
[14:26:08] <pr0ton> um, so i run into some bug :-/
[14:26:16] <pr0ton> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'match'
[14:26:40] <vacho> devinrolsen, thanks
[14:26:56] <lathan> pr0ton, are you trying to do a string .match on an object?
[14:27:02] <pr0ton> lathan
[14:27:04] <pr0ton> no
[14:27:06] <vacho> devinrolsen, I would love to make this function go through all selects and remove duplicates: http://pastebin.com/SK66sBtd
[14:27:22] <lathan> pr0ton, that message means something is trying to call .match on an object that doesn't have a .match method
[14:27:22] <necromancer> oh wow
[14:27:23] <vacho> devinrolsen, so I don't have to define the name of the select, just scan all selects and remove dups
[14:27:36] <pr0ton> lathan, yeah, but my JSON seems valid
[14:27:37] <necromancer> lathan: it only fucks up when the plugin live-validates something onBlur. if i submit the form, my code runs
[14:27:39] <lathan> necromancer, put a pillow on the desk before you faceplant on it :)
[14:27:40] <necromancer> weird
[14:27:42] <pr0ton> but the data looks like a strong
[14:27:45] <lathan> necromancer, woa
[14:27:52] <lathan> pr0ton, simplify your example.
[14:28:09] <pr0ton> http://pastebin.com/2DzBzSKA
[14:28:15] <pr0ton> i do a json.dumps on Django
[14:28:31] <kborchers> necromancer: have you looked at the showErrors option? you could call defaultShowErrors(), then do your custom label modification ... i think. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate#toptions near the bottom
[14:30:18] <kborchers> necromancer: gotta go. hope that helps
[14:30:35] <necromancer> thanks kborchers, i was looking at that but i don't understand it very well :)
[14:30:57] <kborchers> good luck
[14:32:33] <lathan> pr0ton, that looks valid.....

[14:36:19] <lathan> MoTiOnXml, try running your code through jslint
[14:36:21] <lathan> ?jslint
[14:36:22] <bot-t> JSLint,The JavaScript Code Quality Tool - http://www.jslint.com/
[14:38:18] <MoTiOnXml> lathan: yes, doing that
[14:38:34] <MoTiOnXml> lathan: is there a quick tip for quickly validating a jquery ready block?
[14:38:41] <MoTiOnXml> lathan: jslint complains like hell
[14:38:58] <lathan> MoTiOnXml, the IE's are sensitive to slight errors that other browsers work with.
[14:39:05] <Boudga> when doing $.getJSON does it send the request just like a standard querystring GET request?
[14:39:17] <lathan> Boudga, yes
[14:39:34] <pr0ton> so i cant do like jQuery.parseJSON
[14:40:40] <fabiobik> hello
[14:41:00] <lathan> ?hi @ fabiobik
[14:41:01] <bot-t> fabiobik, :)

[14:41:35] <lathan> pr0ton, parse json comes natively with javascript. why should jQuery reinvent the wheel?
[14:41:49] <fabiobik> i want to select the  father div of an class  here the example. how to doo it? http://jsfiddle.net/JvyAD/1/
[14:41:58] <MoTiOnXml> lathan: the jslint errors doesn't make sense
[14:42:25] <MoTiOnXml> Problem at line 10 character 17: Expected 'for' at column 9, not column 17. -> for (var i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {

[14:42:26] <bot-t> lathan, jQuery.parseJSON - Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[14:42:32] <MoTiOnXml> doesn't make sense to me
[14:42:41] <lathan> djQuery, jQuery caved?
[14:42:56] <fabiobik> i want to select the  father div of an class  here the example http://jsfiddle.net/JvyAD/1/    but i only will know the name of class. how to doo it?
[14:43:07] <lathan> fabiobik, you can't do that with css
[14:43:15] <djQuery> lathan: waws it well formed then? see ?jsonhint
[14:43:26] <lathan> fabiobik, in jQuery it would be $('.son').parent()
[14:43:28] <bot-t> lathan, Sunday, 2011-05-22 - http://services.jquery.com/#jquery_20110522.log.html
[14:44:04] <fabiobik> lathan what i want is if clicked on son class, close father div
[14:44:17] <lathan> fabiobik, then you're using jQuery, not css
[14:44:22] <lathan> congrats!
[14:44:23] <fabiobik> lathan idependently of the name of the father
[14:44:59] <lathan> $('.son').click(function(){ $(this).parent().hide() });
[14:45:02] <necromancer> how do you set class rules in jQuery.validate?
[14:45:14] <fabiobik> latharn so i need to do this $('.son').parent().close() ?
[14:45:52] <lathan> fabiobik, careful using the class selector there, but yes
[14:46:07] <lucenut> I have a simple form I am validating and I need to validate that the start_time selectbox is before the end_time selectbox.
[14:46:08] <lathan> the class selector will grab all .son elements on the page
[14:46:09] <lucenut> http://pastebin.com/AXBzRR5m
[14:46:10] <fabiobik> lathan why?
[14:46:20] <lucenut> There's my validation script.
[14:46:24] <Solow> I have a js object. This object does a .each(). Now I'm wondering... if 'this' refers to the DOMElement, how would I access the object from within the .each() callback?
[14:46:36] <fabiobik> lathan but im specifying the name of class not in general
[14:47:54] <lathan> fabiobik, classes are meant to be put on multiple elements
[14:48:03] <lathan> fabiobik, unless you mean to close every son's parent......

[14:48:26] <fabiobik> lathan ya you right...
[14:48:31] <devinrolsen> is there a way to make .load() append its data to an element vs. completely replacing it?
[14:48:40] <lathan> devinrolsen, not with load
[14:49:01] <devinrolsen> figured as much.. ok $.ajax here I come.
[14:49:04] <fabiobik> lathan its not working ... http://jsfiddle.net/JvyAD/4/
[14:49:06] <lathan> devinrolsen, you could do $.get and ....
[14:49:12] <lathan> ?its not working @ fabiobik
[14:49:15] <Solow> devinrolsen: There is a way, It's just not pretty. You'd best go with something that fetches data only

[14:49:18] <lathan> arg
[14:49:24] <coleGillespie> does anyone know how to reload an unordered list in jquerymobile one you append elements to it?
[14:49:24] <lucenut> It's probably very simple.
[14:49:48] <fabiobik> lathan huh?
[14:49:51] <lathan> fabiobik, oh, not close, see ?hide

[14:50:25] <lathan> coleGillespie, I haven't heard of something that sorts elements for you....anywhere....
[14:51:14] <coleGillespie> lathan: i do not need elements to be sorted, i just need to append an li to a loaded jquery page and then make sure it has the right ui just like all the other pages

[14:52:04] <nym> hey, i'm using jquery ui buttons, and i want to color one slightly differently than another (green instead of grey).. any idea how to achieve this?
[14:52:24] <devinrolsen> edit the buttons css.

[14:53:45] <coleGillespie> and i want to do it when document is ready. so i was wondering if jquerymobile has something like a refresh method
[14:54:18] <nym> devinrolsen: think primary and secondary
[14:54:32] <nym> devinrolsen: i don't want to change the entire theme, just a specific button
[14:55:03] <nym> e.g. $("button#mybutton").button({type: "secondary"})
[14:55:34] <lucenut> Anyone, on the comparing 2 select boxes in validate?
[14:56:19] <boogyman> nym: add a class then style with CSS
[14:56:29] <nym> boogyman: ok
[14:56:33] <devinrolsen> sorry nym, I'm not familier with jquery ui buttons but switch the design of the button via class.
[14:56:41] <nym> thought there might have been another way
[14:56:42] <devinrolsen> yeah as boogyman said.
[14:56:44] <TonserPerson> Hey :) does anyone have any experience using something like YoxView with Joomla?
[14:56:47] <nym> ty!
[15:01:08] <devinrolsen> no talking!

[15:11:16] <alexidoia> ?
[15:21:31] <notbenh> does jQuery provide a way to access the URL/GET params (ie: http://host.com/var=val ) ? google keeps pointing me to folks unpakcking win.loc.href
[15:21:38] <notbenh> is this still the only/best way?
[15:22:36] <Tobsn> notbenh
[15:22:38] <Tobsn> no but its easy
[15:22:39] <Tobsn> one sec
[15:22:50] <Tobsn> var P={};(function(q,u,e,r,y){q=/\+/g;u=/([^&=]+)=?([^&]*)/g;e=function(s){return decodeURIComponent(s.replace(q,' '));};r=window.location.search.substring(1);while(y=u.exec(r)){P[e(y[1])]=e(y[2]);}})();
[15:22:51] <Tobsn> there ya go
[15:22:57] <Tobsn> P['val']
[15:23:09] <Tobsn> or P.val
[15:23:38] <SEJeff> hahaha
[15:23:45] <Tobsn> ;)
[15:23:46] <SEJeff> Tobsn, And obvious too
[15:23:47] <notbenh> Tobsn: thanks
[15:23:51] <SEJeff> I was just thinking of that regex in my head
[15:23:56] <Tobsn> hehe
[15:24:00] <Tobsn> im using that for a long time now

[15:38:04] <JordiGH> Does var foo = $("#foo"); create a copy? If I modify foo, will the element with id "foo" in the DOM get modified?
[15:38:18] <JordiGH> It doesn't seem to, but I wonder why, and if so, what's the point of .clone()
[15:38:23] <JordiGH> ?
[15:38:41] <necromancer> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6474460/jquery-validate-and-validating-by-class
[15:38:50] <necromancer> can anyone shed some light onto that issue? ^^
[15:38:59] <ajpiano> JordiGH: no, it doesn't create a copy
[15:39:04] <ajpiano> the point of clone is to... clone an element.
[15:39:25] <JordiGH> Never mind, I see why it was working. I was only grabbing foo.html() to do stuff, which of course creates a copy.
[15:40:46] <lathan> JordiGH, var foo = $("#foo") simple stores the copy of the search and its "reference" to the results of the search
[15:41:04] <lathan> *simply
[15:41:37] <abjorn> You know what's fun? Having someone threaten to sue you.
[15:41:44] <lathan> very :)
[15:42:54] <lathan> spilled coffee?
[15:43:07] <JordiGH> abjorn: We just had that in our mailing list. Some dude couldn't figure out how to use Mailman to unsubscribe from it, and someone told him to Google it. He threatened to sue that person. Then we told him to calm down, and he threatened to sue everyone who told him to calm down.
[15:43:20] <lathan> lol
[15:43:22] <JordiGH> lol
[15:43:23] <lathan> it'd never work
[15:43:33] <abjorn> lol
[15:44:26] <abjorn> I'm a chat tech at HostGator and as soon as this chat starts the guy just pastes a big reply he got to a ticket he made. I didn't read the whole thing but it was clear that we terminated his account for misuse or something, and he was threatening the company and wanted a big settlement from us, and we were just like "hah no"
[15:44:45] <abjorn> Since HostGator is a private company so they can terminate an account for whatever damn reason they want lol
[15:45:36] <abjorn> And he's saying that his ticket was directed at Lance (the CEO) or something and it was illegal for anyone but Lance to respond to it and he was gonna sue me (as if I was the one that made the reply) lol
[15:46:00] <alexidoia> anyone familiar with jqtouch photo gallery ?
[15:46:04] <abjorn> and I kept telling him that I can't do anything about it, he needs to talk to him, told him how to get a message sent directly to Lance, etc, but he just kept giving me the same threads lol
[15:46:47] <Tobsn> erm, is there some effect known in FF that adds the content you just added with jquery twice at the very moment you reload? i see my content double when i reload for a fraction of a second
[15:47:49] <ajpiano> lol JordiGH what mailing list is that
[15:48:26] <abjorn> was he then like "im gona sue googl now becuz of this mailin list"
[15:49:12] <nicholas_> im using a .corner plugin and i am calling $("#rounded").corner(); but it seems to only corner the first div if there are more than one..
[15:49:40] <ajpiano> nicholas_, ids are meant - required in fact - to be unique
[15:49:53] <nicholas_> okey
[15:49:58] <nicholas_> would it work with a class?
[15:49:59] <ajpiano> and with that, this train is about to arrive - use a class and good luck
[15:50:07] <ajpiano> yes
[15:50:09] <nicholas_> thanks
[15:50:10] <lathan> Tobsn, not that I am aware of @ FF
[15:50:19] <Tobsn> its so weird
[15:50:41] <Tobsn> like it happens only on reload for a fraction of a second that is all the elements appended again
[15:51:22] <abjorn> blues train a rollin
[15:51:44] <lathan> abjorn, some people act (or are) bipolar or some other agressive / depressive disorder, and feel like conquering the world.....
[15:51:57] <abjorn> lol
[15:52:08] <abjorn> it was pretty funny in retrospect, though, because it was so hard to take him seriously
[15:52:13] <lathan> lol
[15:52:21] <lathan> too crazy to be serious.....
[15:52:26] <abjorn> because his spelling and grammar were awful but his whole stance was "I KNOW LAW LOL DO U KNO LAW? NO U DONT LOL"
[15:52:33] <abjorn> he actually used "lol" several times
[15:52:38] <abjorn> and said those exact things
[15:52:43] <lathan> haha
[15:52:56] <abjorn> Of course I can't be like "No, but I know how to spell."
[15:53:04] <lathan> abjorn, yah, I know that the law doesn't force me to do your every whim
[15:53:10] <abjorn> Or "No, but our lawyers do. Go talk to them instead of bothering me, I have real work to do."
[15:53:12] <lathan> haha
[15:53:18] <lathan> lol!
[15:53:30] <lathan> that's great~!
[15:53:35] <abjorn> "No, but I do know that the law says we can terminate your account for any reason we want."
[15:53:45] <abjorn> so bugger off
[16:08:27] <emx> i guess it is not possible to remove all classes that begin with 'foobar', right?
[16:12:42] <Null_> anyone have suggestions on a good plugin to keep history for ajax requests? Seem to be a bunch out there.
[16:14:58] <colin3440> why would $("li#inbox").css("display", "inline"); be giving me the error "TypeError: $("li#inbox") is null" when I KNOW that it exists? I found it in the source code and it's definitely there
[16:15:51] <emx> colin3440, show the html snipet and you are missing {} in css()
[16:16:19] <emx> no, you are not
[16:16:32] <snover> colin3440: Because in your environment, $ is not jQuery
[16:19:50] <colin3440> okay when I replaced $ with jQuery it worked. Why did $ stop being jQuery?
[16:20:22] <phxheat> hi, how i have a bunch of LI's, but all are display:none except for one; how do i get the index position if this shown li?
[16:21:38] <fris> colin3440 is it wordpress? if so you have to specify it
[16:22:08] <fris> or just add a $ in the document ready and you can keep the $() 's
[16:22:16] <colin3440> fris: No it's firebug actually
[16:22:36] <fris> hrmm weird
[16:22:45] <colin3440> fris: what do you mean add $ in the document?
[16:22:56] <fris> jQuery(document).ready(function($){
[16:23:12] <colin3440> interesting.. I'll try that
[16:23:35] <emx> phxheat, i would .find() all li's and .each() through them and run a counter and then return;
[16:24:11] <ajpiano> phxheat $("li:visible").index()
[16:34:00] <lathan> emx, it would be difficult, and probably slow. $('[class]').each(function(){ if(this.class.match('...something') ) { replace ... something } ) );
[16:34:09] <lathan> emx, @ removing foobar *
[16:36:08] <timwis> Evening all
[16:36:45] <timwis> Isn't jquery 1.6's prop() method supposed to get the original setting of an element? I'm trying to get the original height and it's coming back undefined
[17:16:37] <lathan> ?prop
[17:16:38] <bot-t> lathan, .prop() - Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[17:16:45] <lathan> ?prop#sig
[17:16:45] <bot-t> lathan, .prop() - Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/#sig
[17:19:03] <lathan> timwis, no, the prop method isn't used to get the original html value of the attribute. it is used to handle "properties" that are stored as attributes, such as a radio buttons checked property. no matter what the attr('checked') equals, if it is there itsvalue is true
[17:29:42] <devinrolsen> .load() is the only ajax method that lets you choose page fragments correct?
[17:46:10] <lathan> devinrolsen, yes
[17:46:28] <lathan> its the only ajax method that places the resutls of the ajax into the dom
[17:46:42] <devinrolsen> thanks.
[17:47:28] <lathan> you could easily do it yourself: $.get(url,function(data){ $('#div').empt().append($(data).find('#fragment')); })
[17:47:31] <lathan> devinrolsen, ^^
[17:48:31] <BlackAnt> kk
[17:49:22] <devinrolsen> or just have my server side guy render me only the fragments I need from the page ;) But useful to know lathan thanks again.
[17:50:22] <lathan> devinrolsen, correct, serverside filtering is more efficient
[17:50:49] <kunnis> Hey, what do I need to google on to learn how to do this.   I Have a form, it has a hidden field, and a textbox.   I need to select the textbox where the hidden field has a spacific value
[17:51:15] <kunnis> but I have multiple forms, I can't edit the page, only the javascript, so I can't mark it with a class
[17:54:26] <lathan> kunnis, you need to find a textbox in a form that has a hidden field?
[17:54:41] <lathan> do any of those fields have ids? or just field names?
[17:55:07] <kunnis> just field names, and the field names on the different forms have the same field names.
[17:55:21] <kunnis> there's multiple forms on the page
[17:55:30] <lathan> $('form:has(:hidden[name="blah"][value="foo"]) input[name="field2"]')
[17:55:33] <lathan> kunnis, ^^
[17:56:01] <lathan> select a form that (has a hidden field, name = blah and value = foo) and find the input name = field2 inside that form
[17:56:03] <kunnis> Thanks.  My Jquery-foo is not strong enough yet.  I must train harder!
[17:56:16] <lathan> "jQuery-foo", love it!
[17:56:21] <kunnis> Thank you sensai!
[17:56:28] <lathan> ?np @ kunnis
[17:56:28] <bot-t> kunnis, No Problem
[17:56:38] <lathan> padawan :)
[17:56:56] <lathan> ?:has
[17:56:57] <bot-t> :has(selector): Selects elements which contain at least one element that matches the specified selector. http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/
[17:57:01] <lathan> ?attribute-equals
[17:57:02] <bot-t> lathan, Attribute Equals Selector [name="value"] - Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value exactly equal to a certain value. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[17:57:11] <lathan> ?rtfm @ kunnis
[17:57:11] <bot-t> kunnis, http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page is your friend
[17:57:31] <kunnis> yeah, I just started using the attirbute selector...   IT's just knowing how to use pieces together.
[17:57:46] <lathan> yah, that's something that can't be taught, you just pick it up with use
[17:57:51] <kunnis> *nods*
[17:58:05] <lathan> a lot of it is expressing what you need in the terms that jQuery has
[17:58:43] <lathan> to find an input in the same form as a hidden field you have to find a form that has that hidden field, and then look for that final field within the form
[17:58:52] <kunnis> yeah, I just didn't know about has...
[18:00:39] <lathan> just be careful because it is doing a lot of work
[18:00:57] <lathan> every form it finds it has to search through all its descendents to find a hidden field
[18:01:17] <lathan> you always want to use the most basic selectors first in order to reduce the work jQuery has to do
[18:01:35] <kunnis> Yeah.  I've seen over-use of jquery killing the pref of pages before
[18:01:44] <lathan> (i.e.: I selected the form first. (tag-name searches are native javascript: document.getElementsByTagName))
[18:02:40] <lathan> I did :hidden (which searched for input (another tag name search) and only then type=hidden and name=... and value=.... which jQuery has to do the hard way, searching every element previously matched to find those values)
[18:02:43] <kunnis> We were using jquery, doing heavy use of class selectors, when we knew IE was the target.  We got burned hard by that.
[18:02:57] <lathan> IE doesn't do class selectors well?
[18:03:13] <kunnis> Not as of a bout a year and a half ago.
[18:03:17] <lathan> tag name, id , and class selectors are the safest ones
[18:03:33] <lathan> maybe your page just had a lot of elements, that will slow down any search
[18:03:35] <kunnis> class requires it to walk through the dom.
[18:03:41] <kunnis> in javascript
[18:03:44] <lathan> kunnis, but its not jQuery doing it
[18:03:58] <kunnis> in ie that's jquery doing it
[18:04:00] <lathan> class selector calls the native javascript function: getElementsByClass
[18:04:02] <lathan> what?
[18:04:06] <lathan> ie doesn't have a class selector?
[18:04:13] <kunnis> I think that was the problem
[18:05:32] <kunnis> http://www.anyexample.com/webdev/javascript/javascript_getelementsbyclass_function.xml   disagrees with me.  I dunno.  I just know IE + way too many class selectors was bad.
[18:06:25] <kunnis> Maybe it's just the javascript implmentation is crappy for it
[18:06:34] <lathan> wow...only IE9 has it: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_core.html
[18:06:44] <lathan> and I thought IE couldn't get any worse
[18:07:21] <kunnis> *shrug*
[18:07:50] <kunnis> I'm just starting down this path.  I do server-side dev.   Postbacks all the way!
[18:08:24] <cheezus> ugh, you do asp.net don't you
[18:08:30] <lathan> no way jose
[18:08:38] <lathan> I work with perl
[18:08:39] <kunnis> Yes.  I'm trying to learn better
[18:08:44] <lathan> (mod_perl)
[18:08:54] <kunnis> $.load() is like my most favorite thing now.
[18:08:57] <lathan> hehe
[18:09:11] <lathan> jQuery is just too awesome for me to have a favorite function
[18:09:40] <lathan> jQuery is to javascript, as C is to assembly
[18:10:00] <lathan> you *can* do everything without it, but its soo much harder
[18:10:11] <kunnis> I can let the uber-slow operations run seperatly from the page loading, so I can deal with "We want XXXX on the page" and "we want it to be fast" at the same time.   Where XXX is some piece of data that's hard to compute and non-cacheable.
[18:10:43] <kunnis> I'm doing jquery in my spare time to learn more about it.
[18:12:30] <innociv>  My favorite part is just how elements are created and manipulated.
[18:15:39] <kunnis> I still trying to figure out how to deal with having the markup simple, return stuff from the server, and build markup on the browser nicely.
[18:16:19] <kunnis> how do ya'll deal with stuff like error messages?   Do you just have a bunch of error elements that are hidden?
[18:16:37] <kunnis> There's a lot of ways of doing it, I'm just wondering what approch ya'll are using
[18:20:24] <lathan> $('<miracle aspect="financial" />').appendTo(innociv)
[18:20:30] <lathan> like that? ^
[18:22:28] <lathan> kunnis, I get a page that prints out the field name, and error message (one per line), then I just split it by "\n" and add an error class, adn build a <ol><li>...</li></ol> at the top of the page
[18:22:37] <lathan> *get a page = ajax request responce
[18:22:38] <abjorn> Oh neato, microsoft is working with joyent to get node running good on windows :o
[18:22:46] <lathan> node?
[18:22:47] <lathan> ?node
[18:22:48] <bot-t> lathan, .clone() - Create a copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[18:22:53] <lathan> ?g node @ lathan
[18:22:53] <bot-t> lathan, node.js - http://nodejs.org/
[18:23:10] <lathan> oh lovely, server side js
[18:23:20] <lathan> I've heard great things about it
[18:23:28] <lathan> I still think javascript is too "scripty" for that
[18:23:30] <abjorn> it's neat
[18:23:35] <abjorn> *shrug*
[18:23:44] <abjorn> it's one of those it-depends-how-you-do-it sort of things
[18:23:46] <lathan> I've also been called old-fashioned, but .........
[18:25:21] <abjorn> God damnit. My friend said Joyent sounds like a porn site for an Ent Fetish. Now I'm going to think that every damn time.
[18:25:28] <lathan> lol...haha
[18:25:37] <abjorn> also, HI IMSKY
[18:25:47] <imsky> lololol
[18:25:50] <abjorn> guess what happened at work today? :D
[18:25:52] <imsky> GOOD EVENING GONTOLMON
[18:25:55] <imsky> ALL YOUR BAES
[18:26:01] <lathan> belong to ajpiano
[18:26:01] <imsky> ARE BELONG TO PAUL IRISH
[18:26:06] <lathan> haha
[18:26:09] <abjorn> no
[18:26:12] <abjorn> they belong to me
[18:26:17] <abjorn> as I am
[18:26:19] <abjorn> THE WIGGLAH
[18:26:21] * abjorn wiggles
[18:26:22] * imsky wigglahs
[18:26:24] <imsky> so what happened
[18:26:31] <abjorn> A customer threatened to sue me! :D
[18:26:34] <imsky> YES!
[18:26:35] <imsky> o/
[18:26:46] <abjorn> Broke my someone-threaten-to-sue-me cherry
[18:26:50] <abjorn> As all men must do
[18:26:57] <imsky> o_
[18:26:59] <imsky> arm got tired
[18:27:16] <abjorn> Truly a joyous occasion.
[18:27:20] <imsky> why did
[18:27:20] <imsky> you
[18:27:23] <imsky> get sued
[18:27:29] <abjorn> I didn't get sued, he can't do anything to me lol
[18:27:36] <abjorn> he came in and kinda right off the bat threatened me
[18:27:38] <abjorn> and I was like
[18:27:39] <abjorn> "lol wut?"
[18:27:46] <imsky> so he just came in and threatened to sue?
[18:27:47] <abjorn> like, both the ceo Lance, and me personally
[18:27:49] <abjorn> and I was like
[18:27:49] <lathan> well, I am naive then...no one's threatened to sue me......
[18:27:52] <imsky> just like "hello, i'd like to sue you"
[18:27:54] <abjorn> "wat"
[18:27:55] <lathan> lol
[18:28:09] <abjorn> Well, quite angrier than that, as you can imagine, but sort of
[18:28:13] <imsky> wow
[18:28:19] <imsky> maybe he had a legit reason
[18:28:22] <abjorn> He didn't
[18:28:27] <imsky> he shoulda wiggled
[18:28:42] <abjorn> He came in and pasted a long reply he got from our legal department on a ticket he made
[18:28:58] <imsky> 0_o
[18:29:00] <abjorn> it sounded like we terminated his account and he was quite mad about it and demanded ridiculous compensation
[18:29:05] <abjorn> like, that's actually the word legal used
[18:29:08] <abjorn> ridiculous
[18:29:11] <imsky> dude your first week at work
[18:29:13] <imsky> is brutal
[18:29:16] <abjorn> second haha
[18:29:28] <Techdeck> hey guys, is there a way to listen on an event (like mouseenter) and make it be the primary one until I'm done handling it?
[18:29:35] <abjorn> what's funny is my supervisor was like "yeah the first chat I ever got in training was like that"
[18:29:35] <imsky> Techdeck: ya
[18:29:48] <Techdeck> cause now, when I mouseenter/mouseleave out of something it keeps rerunning the event
[18:29:54] <imsky> ya man, ya
[18:29:58] <imsky> totes ally
[18:30:03] <abjorn> event.stopPropagation()
[18:30:18] <imsky> or custom events...
[18:30:20] <abjorn> or that
[18:30:20] <imsky> WHATEVER YOU KNOW
[18:30:25] <abjorn> ?stoppropagation
[18:30:26] <bot-t> event.stopPropagation(): This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[18:30:27] <Techdeck> where do I run event.stopPropagation()?
[18:30:30] <imsky> lolol
[18:30:35] <imsky> i like your username
[18:30:36] <abjorn> check that link
[18:30:37] <imsky> tech...deck
[18:30:41] <Techdeck> do I run it once the event is ran
[18:30:47] <imsky> it's like
[18:30:48] <abjorn> like those tekdek finger skateboard
[18:30:50] <Techdeck> ok, thanks guys!
[18:30:51] <imsky> yeah
[18:30:52] <abjorn> we had when i was in elemntary
[18:31:01] <imsky> jesus we had them when i was in middle school
[18:31:02] <abjorn> such a useless fucking thing but they were sooo cool
[18:31:02] <imsky> >_>
[18:31:05] <imsky> <_<
[18:31:07] <imsky> age...difference
[18:31:11] <abjorn> psh
[18:31:13] <abjorn> you old man
[18:31:15] <imsky> so olde
[18:31:17] <abjorn> what are you...23? GEEZ
[18:31:21] <imsky> close!
[18:31:29] <abjorn> 2........2?
[18:31:33] <imsky> i am...3...9
[18:31:36] <imsky> yeeeeah that's it
[18:31:42] <imsky> good ole 39er
[18:31:42] <abjorn> 3 and 9 months?
[18:31:44] <imsky> on the freeway
[18:31:52] <imsky> yes
[18:31:57] <imsky> i'm a prodigy
[18:32:00] <imsky> not the artist
[18:32:05] <abjorn> A prodigy wiggler
[18:32:08] * imsky wigglos
[18:32:14] * abjorn wiggloz
[18:32:22] * imsky wigglows
[18:32:37] <imsky> now i wiggle and glow at the same time
[18:32:40] <imsky> wat a tremendous feat
[18:32:41] <abjorn> Wiggle really should be catching on more than it has been.
[18:32:44] <imsky> seriously
[18:32:50] <imsky> i think you're not doing the marketing
[18:32:56] <abjorn> yeah not really
[18:33:11] <imsky> we got iframes in iframes wiggling away
[18:33:13] <imsky> that's like
[18:33:15] <imsky> the best campaign ever
[18:33:38] <abjorn> I could update it to use that hack that makes animations use hardware accel in browsers that support it
[18:33:47] <abjorn> then be like "LOOK EVERYONE"
[18:34:11] <imsky> i can't wait until webkit or whoever adds freeform deformation to CSS
[18:34:14] <Techdeck> ah crap
[18:34:15] <Techdeck> :(
[18:34:22] <Techdeck> "Since the .live() method handles events once they have propagated to the top of the document, it is not possible to stop propagation of live events. Similarly, events handled by .delegate() will always propagate to the element to which they are delegated; event handlers on any elements below it will already have been executed by the time the delegated event handler is called."
[18:34:22] <abjorn> ?
[18:34:26] <Techdeck> I use .live() :(
[18:34:28] <imsky> genie effect in the browser mayyne
[18:34:34] <imsky> Techdeck: use custom events
[18:34:37] <abjorn> ^
[18:34:41] <imsky> v
[18:34:45] <Techdeck> imsky, can you show me an example?
[18:34:55] <imsky> Techdeck: man i just got done with a day of back-to-back jquery
[18:35:01] <imsky> short answer: search google
[18:35:03] <lathan> Techdeck, no, you can cancel a live event by using a regular event earlier in the tree
[18:35:19] <imsky> .live is kind of a pitiful shortcut if you think about it
[18:35:24] <Techdeck> lathan, what do you mean?
[18:35:34] <lathan> $.live('click',....); $('body').click(function(e){ e.stopPropagation() }); @ Techdeck
[18:35:46] <lathan> or instead of body, make that $('input')
[18:35:53] <imsky> wubwobweb
[18:36:02] <lathan> imsky, live is okay, its delegate that is a noob-cut
[18:36:04] <Techdeck> hmm
[18:36:18] <imsky> lathan, live is sloooe and sometimes inconvenient
[18:36:18] <Techdeck> I see, that's a nice hack
[18:36:21] <lathan> imsky, It takes me longer to figure out delegate than to write out the code myself :P
[18:36:27] <imsky> lolol
[18:36:49] <lathan> Techdeck, if your live function knows all the exceptions I think its better to just if(...) in the live function
[18:36:52] <lathan> but if not......
[18:36:53] <imsky> really getting jquery's event model pays off, though
[18:37:00] <lathan> your local code can have exceptions
[18:37:00] <imsky> so much time you can save
[18:37:09] <Techdeck> lathan, can I show you my issue?
[18:37:11] <imsky> abjorn: what's going on with your other projects
[18:37:13] <lathan> their ajaxError events could use some of that cancel-ability
[18:37:14] <Techdeck> I have a web with it
[18:37:22] <Techdeck> err, a web site*
[18:37:23] <lathan> I'm actually getting off right now...... :(
[18:37:27] <Techdeck> aww
[18:37:28] <imsky> lol
[18:37:31] <lathan> sorry
[18:37:33] <imsky> yeah dude it's friday...night
[18:37:36] <Techdeck> but you really wanna see this
[18:37:41] <imsky> gonna get supa drunk in a bit
[18:37:44] <Techdeck> it's AWESOME
[18:37:49] <lathan> okay, real quick
[18:37:51] <Techdeck> one of the best apps I built in a while :P
[18:37:57] <imsky> it better print money
[18:38:00] <abjorn> imsky: I have a CouchDB wrapper library for js that's going really well
[18:38:06] <imsky> abjorn: yeah, the sofaking
[18:38:11] <abjorn> the node module works completely
[18:38:12] <abjorn> ya

[18:38:26] <abjorn> inorite
[18:38:38] <imsky> irc is pretty cool in that respect
[18:38:46] <imsky> myspace came and went, facebook is kinda going down
[18:38:51] <imsky> irc is still trucking
[18:38:59] <imsky> YOU CANT KILL IT
[18:38:59] <abjorn> what about twatter
[18:39:02] <imsky> it's pre-web
[18:39:07] <imsky> yeah twitter is kinda jank too
[18:39:13] <Techdeck> lathan, you like?
[18:39:18] <abjorn> twatter is kinda neat
[18:39:23] <imsky> i'm on that twatter

[18:40:58] <imsky> twitter's kinda jank
[18:41:00] <abjorn> lol
[18:41:02] <lathan> Techdeck, you keep adding animations to the fx queue
[18:41:11] <lathan> you need to clear the queue on an item in your hover function
[18:41:26] <imsky> but i guess i'll add a fellow wiggla
[18:41:26] <Techdeck> how do I clear it?
[18:41:35] <lathan> ?clearQueue @ Techdeck
[18:41:35] <bot-t> Techdeck, .clearQueue([queueName]): Remove from the queue all items that have not yet been run. http://api.jquery.com/clearQueue/
[18:41:36] <imsky> though don't expect me to read your damn tweets
[18:41:46] <Techdeck> holy shit
[18:41:47] <Techdeck> awesome
[18:41:52] <Techdeck> thanks a lot lathan!
[18:41:55] <imsky> abjorn: ur followet
[18:41:57] <Techdeck> the queue name is the event name?
[18:42:00] <lathan> that may not work completely
[18:42:06] <abjorn> wewt
[18:42:08] <lathan> Techdeck, the queuename defaults to 'fx' which all the others do
[18:42:13] <abjorn> imsky.co
[18:42:14] <imsky> i'm adopting a karl lagerfeld twitter personality
[18:42:14] <Techdeck> ah
[18:42:18] <lathan> that name is for custom queueing functions
[18:42:20] <imsky> one tweet per 6 months
[18:42:25] <lathan> Techdeck, using queue, see ?queue
[18:42:26] <bot-t> Techdeck, .queue([queueName]): Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[18:42:48] <lathan> ?queue( queueName, newQueue
[18:42:48] <bot-t> jQuery.queue(element, [queueName], newQueue): Manipulate the queue of functions to be executed on the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.queue/#jQuery.queue2
[18:42:54] <Techdeck> awesome
[18:42:56] <Techdeck> thanks man
[18:42:56] <lathan> Techdeck, that's you you queue custom functions ^^
[18:43:02] <lathan> that's the main jist
[18:43:11] * Techdeck gasms
[18:43:12] <lathan> it may leave the items in the up position.....
[18:43:29] <imsky> lol dammit
[18:43:57] <lathan> alright, tata people!
[18:47:38] <imsky> derp
[18:47:44] <copongcopong> is this the right channel to ask jqm questions?
[18:47:57] <imsky> NO
[18:49:14] <imsky> there's #jquerymobile for all dat noise
[18:50:04] <abjorn> you can here too
[18:50:16] <abjorn> wait, is there actually a #jquerymobile?
[18:50:20] <imsky> yeah mayne
[18:50:29] <abjorn> oh, cool
[18:50:31] <imsky> how can you use the web client?
[18:50:36] <imsky> shit's all retarded
[18:50:44] <abjorn> well, you can ask here, but you'll get better results in #jquerymobile copongcopong
[18:51:00] <imsky> lolol copong
[18:51:38] <copongcopong> :)
[18:52:05] <copongcopong> i am already on #jquerymobile ‚Ä¶ but they all appear to be sleeping at the moment
[18:52:17] <imsky> yeah this is a pretty bad time to be on irc for tech help
[18:53:06] <phishy> can anyone point me to some information on how to organize more complex javascript UI applications? one project i am building is starting to get large and unwieldy..
[18:53:19] <imsky> you too huh
[18:53:36] <imsky> http://addyosmani.com/blog/large-scale-jquery/ is a good start
[18:59:22] <imsky> got my internet knocked da fuuuck out
[19:06:12] <imsky> aaand it's back
[19:12:00] <abjorn> You know, for being a web hosting company, HostGator has...really shitty web developers to be honest
[19:12:11] <abjorn> we use a lot of web based tools and they're...pretty poorly made
[19:12:17] <abjorn> not poorly designed, mind you, just poorly made
[19:12:40] <bapi__> I have a checkbox, is there any simple way to toggle the visibility of a div after the state of a checkbox?
[19:12:46] <bapi__> checked = visible, not checked = hidden
[19:13:32] <imsky> abjorn: lol you should see what kind of developers other companies have
[19:13:45] <imsky> one guy i know has apparently programmed his whole life in notepad.exe
[19:13:48] <abjorn> bapi__: .click()
[19:13:55] <abjorn> ?click @ bapi__
[19:14:01] <abjorn> ...bot-t?
[19:14:05] <abjorn> :(
[19:14:18] <imsky> bot-t has gone

[19:15:07] <imsky> come on bruv
[19:15:09] <imsky> get on it
[19:15:22] <abjorn> Why would I want to make a new bot when there's bot-t?
[19:15:32] <imsky> less downtime
[19:15:42] <abjorn> That can be fixed easier than making a new bot
[19:15:57] <imsky> hmm what do ye wanna do
[19:16:01] <imsky> send some pizzas to coldhead?
[19:17:14] <abjorn> why would that help thoo

[19:37:10] <Kolbsoft> Howdy
[19:40:14] <Guest16033> I have a very simple requirement.....I have a Submit button...When i submit it uploads the photos that I have asked the users to upload. What i want is that while the upload is happening, the user should see a preloader so that he knows that something is happening instead of pressing the submit button again after getting impatient. Please guide as to how I could posibly accomplish this. Thanks
[19:40:14] <Guest16033> for your help and guidance.
[19:40:59] <Guddu> I just changed my nick :-)

[20:09:55] <USvER> guyz
[20:10:03] <USvER> Hello )
[20:10:15] <USvER> Is there some1 who not sleep?
[20:11:23] <USvER> I nead recursively fetch data with ajax... Can someone helpme?
[20:12:03] <coldhead> can you show us what you have so far, USvER ?
[20:12:06] <coldhead> ?p @ USvER
[20:12:13] <coldhead> oh thx bot-t
[20:12:25] <USvER> hmmm w8 a sec
[20:12:43] <coldhead> Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net
[20:13:59] <USvER> http://jsfiddle.net/xfnYd/
[20:14:09] <USvER> somethin like this
[20:16:41] <coldhead> cool
[20:17:05] <USvER> I know this is kinda shit-coding
[20:17:23] <USvER> But there is no other way for me
[20:17:29] <coldhead> do you know what "return $.get(etc.." actually returns?
[20:17:42] <USvER> deffered?
[20:17:55] <USvER> so i will know when it ends?
[20:18:05] <coldhead> cool
[20:18:08] <USvER> cos i actualy nead this
[20:18:30] <coldhead> and is your code hosted at mostfilm.tv?
[20:18:43] <USvER> nope = )
[20:18:55] <coldhead> hmm
[20:19:03] <coldhead> you can't do ajax across domains
[20:19:12] <USvER> it's a Chrome extension so cross sit policy is ok
[20:19:35] <coldhead> oh yeah? thanks, chrome!
[20:20:06] <USvER> i think all other browsers has this too
[20:20:27] <USvER> for extensions(plug-ins)
[20:20:44] <coldhead> this is hard to understand!
[20:20:50] <USvER> Can you suggest me somethin about recursion?
[20:21:13] <USvER> sr my English rly bad
[20:21:25] <systemfault> Recursion is recursion.
[20:21:32] <USvER> y i know
[20:21:40] <coldhead> USvER: does it work okay without the recursion?
[20:21:47] <USvER> to understand recursion you first must understend recursion
[20:22:05] <USvER> coldhead, nope it's not
[20:22:32] <USvER> i want to find some info on this and i can't
[20:22:45] <coldhead> what is not working?
[20:22:47] <USvER> so maybe some1 on IRC done this before
[20:23:13] <coldhead> okay i will let someone who has done it before try to help you
[20:23:23] <coldhead> sorry it's my first day using jQuery
[20:23:28] <USvER> i wrote that code on single breath.... and it's not working )
[20:27:21] <rafacv> hi there, digging the docs i didn't find if there's a way to check which selector matches a single element in a each loop
[20:27:24] <rafacv> e.g., $("a, p").each( function () { $(this).matched_by == "a" } )
[20:27:26] <USvER> So i fetch paginated pages and search for info that i nead... and when pagination is over or i found what i want i nead to stop..... And after that i nead to process fetched data further
[20:27:41] <rafacv> anybody have hints on this?
[20:29:20] <coldhead> this.tagName == 'a', rafacv
[20:30:03] <rafacv> not really what i'm looking for, coldhead. it could be any selector at all, which i'm not aware of beforehand
[20:30:55] <rafacv> i know $(this) would never do the trick because `this` is the DOM element and all matching info would be lost at the time i'm wrapping it up with jQuery
[20:31:30] <coldhead> how do you know what "a" is then?
[20:31:56] <coldhead> oh you want to know if it matches some selector
[20:32:19] <coldhead> you want $(this).is('p,:input,.someclass')
[20:32:22] <USvER> i think there is no such functionality
[20:32:26] <coldhead> is <3
[20:33:07] <USvER> but he talking about dinamic selectors
[20:33:17] <rafacv> yeah, i think is would be perfect
[20:33:20] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/5ZSad/
[20:33:25] <coldhead> is() ^^
[20:33:33] <USvER> so he will nead to store that selectors globaly
[20:33:42] <rafacv> thanks coldhead!
[20:33:52] <niftylettuce> if this = palettes[0] object, how do I get the index value of this (w/o using function(index, value) {}?
[20:34:03] <niftylettuce> (e.g. I want to return 0
[20:34:10] <niftylettuce> I think I am just having a brain fart
[20:34:13] <niftylettuce> o_O
[20:34:32] <USvER> this[0]?
[20:34:43] <niftylettuce> ah I got it
[20:34:47] <niftylettuce> nvm :) noobbbbbb
[20:34:53] * niftylettuce is da n00b
[20:36:21] <BlackAnt> I feel like ahh
[20:37:17] <USvER> How to parse HTML as XML...?
[20:37:52] <BlackAnt> No.
[20:38:31] <USvER> i want to parse AJAX returned html data as XML so i can use selectors etc
[20:38:57] <USvER> regex on text is megacomplex
[20:39:53] <BlackAnt> <input type="file" id="myfile" /> I've done var $file = $('#myfiles').val(); . but it returned No file Index in json response
[20:39:53] <USvER> something like /"(\/static\/icons\/.*?)"[\s\S]*?"\/discuss\.php\?cat=(\d+)&s=(.*?)&e=(.*?)"[\s\S]*?"\/details\.php\?id=(\d+)"[\s\S]*?'dlt','(\w+)'/ig;
[20:41:21] <rafacv> USvER, just to clarify about my choice on is(): it is dynamic selectors, but i'm given the selectors so i can split commas and iterate it over checking whether is() returns true. thank you too anyways :)
[20:42:32] <Guddu> Is there a way to add a preloader on the submit buttton.....While i wait for the next page to load?
[20:45:19] <BlackAnt> 88% of them are asleep
[20:48:09] <coldhead>  or waiting for better questions >_>
[20:49:34] <Guddu> But Coldhead my question was not tooo bad eh?
[20:49:34] <Guddu> :)
[20:50:56] <USvER> Actualy i'm not understand what you want to do
[20:51:17] <BlackAnt> yeah
[20:51:49] <BlackAnt> I asked a dommy question just to be funny
[20:52:09] <USvER> ...
[20:52:10] <Guddu> I have a form and a submit buttton. Form accepts some image uploads. When the user presses submit the images get uploaded. But while that happens i want to show some kind of hourglass or anything else that tellls the user that something is happening and be patient.
[20:52:50] <Guddu> I don't thnk this is a question that fails to excite the folks out here :-)
[20:52:52] <USvER> oh u nead a uploader plugin
[20:52:53] <Guddu> Well
[20:53:07] <Guddu> In any case a solution will help me a lot.....
[20:53:12] <BlackAnt> ?uploadify @ Guddu
[20:53:12] <Guddu> :-)
[20:53:36] <BlackAnt> there are lots of plugins
[20:54:27] <BlackAnt> ?timee
[20:54:43] <BlackAnt> oh, bot-t
[20:55:00] <Guddu> I wish to use this on a form designed in Expression Engine. That comes with its own upload/file selection mechanism etc
[20:55:13] <bot-t> aa
[20:55:17] <Guddu> The only thing missing is a hourglass while the upload happpens
[20:55:52] <coldhead> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[20:56:52] <BlackAnt> coldhead one reason I dont use those is because I can't get the extensions and push them into array list, which is then stored in a cookie array and sent to the database at a later time
[20:58:12] <coldhead> oh i see
[20:59:15] <BlackAnt> I use php classes along with form.jquery.js and ajax
[20:59:45] <BlackAnt> that will get the job done.
[21:00:05] <BlackAnt> a lil bit sexier than ordinary uplaod form
[21:07:45] <USvER> anybody knows effective way of converting asyc ajax requests to sync?
[21:09:22] <Guddu> Anyone?
[21:09:31] <USvER> ?
[21:11:12] <coldhead> USvER: async: false in your ajax() settings
[21:11:22] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[21:11:23] <USvER> The only way i know of monitoring transfered data is ActionScript...
[21:13:22] <USvER> If you nead just animated gif... you add animated gif to page and on succesfull data submission remove it from page
[21:14:55] <gavin_huang> coldhead, gnarf, i'm still pondering the attr('required') problem, and have a question: why jquery checks prop when it tests a boolean attr' existence? i mean, browser doesn't auto set corresponding prop when an arbitrary boolen attr is set.
[21:24:10] <Veinor> I can't get id selectors to work in my chrome content script using jQuery
[21:51:33] <pcfreak30> Hello. I am using the forms plugin at http://jquery.malsup.com/form/. I am trying to work with a file upload. The issue is I am not getting any response back. In chrome js console, I get a success message. If I inspect the html, I see an iframe with about:blank, and I should be getting back a json response. Also the success callback method never gets fired. Any help?
[22:18:53] <djQuery> wadda I miss
[22:19:05] <coldhead> noobs
[22:19:28] <djQuery> stupid microwave keeps trippin the breaker
[22:19:40] <djQuery> need to run a new line but thats a pain
[22:20:21] <coldhead> just forego the microwave
[22:21:11] <djQuery> frozen hot pockets suck
[22:21:27] <coldhead> hahah
[22:21:30] <coldhead> well summarised
[22:23:18] <pcfreak30> does anyone have experience with jquery forms plugin
[22:23:33] <djQuery> ?anyone@pcfreak30
[22:23:43] <djQuery> .seen bot-t
[22:23:44] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 18 minutes and 56 seconds ago, joining #jquery-meeting
[22:24:03] <djQuery> pcfreak30: see ?.ask
[22:24:11] <coldhead> so exclusive
[22:24:26] <pcfreak30> ?.ask
[22:24:51] <djQuery> just ask ur Q
[22:24:58] <djQuery> damn lazy bot
[22:25:24] <pcfreak30> I can not get the file upload from the forms plugin to go right. it returns a success right away and the iframe has a src of about:blank
[22:25:58] <pcfreak30> the php script its to upload to returns a json response but the sucess method doesnt get fired either
[22:26:21] <Chib> does anyone know any good sites that have libraries of jquery plugins?
[22:26:21] <djQuery> pcfreak30: get a demo together and it is probably something wrong with ur form
[22:26:31] <pcfreak30> ive looked and compared
[22:26:43] <djQuery> Chib: some place like jquery.com perhaps
[22:26:43] <pcfreak30> there is nothing different. ive looked at the upload demo
[22:27:10] <pcfreak30> i got the idea it might be returning a wrong content type so i changed the php header that gets return with no luck
[22:27:36] <pcfreak30> the odd thing to me is the ifdrame goes to "about:blank"
[22:27:49] <pcfreak30> http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#file-upload
[22:28:51] <pcfreak30> http://pastie.org/private/rnogcidesiuejjhh9ybsg <-- some of the jquery code
[22:29:55] <pcfreak30> djQuery: so you have any ideas because this is getting on my nerves...
[22:31:18] <djQuery> pcfreak30: try putting a error: in it?
[22:31:57] <djQuery> u say the success never fires so look at the error/
[22:31:58] <djQuery> ?
[22:32:06] <pcfreak30> there is none
[22:32:16] <pcfreak30> if i look at js console
[22:32:23] <pcfreak30> it returns a success
[22:32:58] <pcfreak30> [jquery.form] state = complete
[22:33:45] <kborchers> pcfreak30: but an error handler will tell u if there was an http error, 500, 404, etc.
[22:34:07] <pcfreak30> kborchers: that id the thing. the iframe target goes to  about:blank
[22:34:15] <pcfreak30> its like it never goes to my script
[22:35:20] <pcfreak30> it immetiatly returns complete with a blsnk iframe simply, and the sucess call back isnt fired.
[22:35:59] <pcfreak30> and I have messed with the authors demo and see no differences, except oddly i cant locate his iframe in the html dom
[22:36:23] <pcfreak30> it really does not make sense to me
[22:37:15] <coldhead> bot-t: sup
[22:37:57] <pcfreak30> the iframe generated has a blank body and header
[22:38:06] <pcfreak30> So any suggestions?
[22:38:17] <niftylettuce> if I run a myClasses.each(function() { subElement = $(this); }), and then I want to bind a click function that applies a class to all of myClasses except subElement, what is best approach in terms of performance for this?
[22:38:26] <bot-t1> (8 hours 19 mins ago) <danbeam> tell niftylettuce yeah, it's so purple even I noticed (and I'm colorblind)
[22:38:33] <coldhead> i'd suggest not uploading via iframes, it's a total hack :(
[22:40:24] <niftylettuce> e.g. inside function() {} is subElement.addClass('three'); and myClasses.addClass('two');  but I don't want subElement to also have .two, only the others.  (without using removeClass, what is alternative?)
[22:40:46] <niftylettuce> remove()?
[22:41:12] <djQuery> niftylettuce: remove will get rid of the whole element
[22:41:36] <niftylettuce> var newClasses = myClasses.remove(subElement);
[22:41:44] <niftylettuce> djQuery: that would work, no?

[22:42:26] <djQuery> niftylettuce: give it a try
[22:42:47] <pcfreak30> djQuery, kborchers: ffmanager.simplyhacks.com <-- thats the page I am currently working on. If you could look at its behavior I would be thankful.
[22:46:20] <kborchers> pcfreak30: Maybe I missed it but I don't see a file upload on that page
[22:46:53] <djQuery> i kept clickin hte link but nit happened
[22:47:32] <pcfreak30> kborchers: what do u see. i took out the login requirement i thought...
[22:48:15] <kborchers> I see login
[22:48:24] <pcfreak30> kborchers: sry, my bad. forgot that page
[22:48:29] <pcfreak30> reload
[22:49:16] <kborchers> Php error line 16
[22:49:27] <pcfreak30> come on.. wow
[22:50:40] <pcfreak30> kborchers: mk should be fixed...
[22:53:55] <kborchers> Well crap, after all of that, im on my iPad and can't do file uploads. Sorry. I think it's time for me to go to bed. I would really try an error handler and see if it gets fired since success doesn't. Other than that I think I will be no more help to you.
[22:54:14] <pcfreak30> um dude
[22:54:20] <pcfreak30> doesnt matter to upload
[22:54:29] <pcfreak30> the iframe method still gets used
[22:54:39] <pcfreak30> its thev fact of what it does
[22:55:04] <pcfreak30> which is make a iframe to about:blank and go to complete status and not fire anything
[22:57:16] <niftylettuce> djQuery: http://pastie.org/private/alyymx2bbl0omzhxjhi3bw i tried but didn't work ><

[23:12:10] <niftylettuce> djQuery: ive used jsfidmuchb4 :)
[23:12:59] <djQuery> niftylettuce: just get rid of the stupid .each
[23:16:52] <djQuery> niftylettuce: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/VrCF9/5/
[23:17:09] <niftylettuce> i think i have to use text()
[23:19:11] <niftylettuce> djQuery: \o tyvm :)
[23:20:01] <djQuery> niftylettuce: was that easier
[23:21:22] <niftylettuce> djQuery: what I'm doing is a little complicated using the Colors plugin along with kolorPicker... so its for choosing a color palette for something, and there are multiple color palettes... problem was default functionality requires use of various z-indexes etc etc and its just a pita
[23:22:01] <niftylettuce> djQuery: I'm thinking of just inheriting existing CSS instead of trying to do this toggleClass method
[23:22:29] <djQuery> niftylettuce: I was only togglein so that you could see tha tht e click was no longer bound
[23:22:47] <niftylettuce> djQuery: yaikno
[23:37:58] <NickASloan> how can I detect whether a browser supports the form attribute on the input element?
[23:44:02] <Axcy> Hey, I use Jquery to hide divs which are shown if users click "Yes " in a radio button - However, in Internet explorer a user has to click away or some place else for the div to show, while it in Firefox shows right away - Can't I make Ie behave the same way?
[23:52:44] <GlobeCrew> i have a link instead an li. should the click event be registered at the anchor or at the li? it seems to work at the li level though
