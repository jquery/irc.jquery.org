[00:00:33] <Cork> mms_: sorry got hong up on something i had to handle
[00:00:47] <mms_> Cork: no probs
[00:01:01] <mms_> Cork: 			data: {range: JSON.stringify ([$("#num1").val(), $("#num2").val(), $("#num3").val()] ) },   does not work well
[00:01:08] <Cork> Myx0x3: its slower, as it does dome compatibility checks, but the speed difference is so low that it doesn't matter
[00:01:11] <mms_> I tried it and that send some binary across
[00:01:27] <Cork> binary?
[00:02:16] <mms_> I means some string
[00:02:19] <Myx0x3> Cork: well the code gets shorter also, does it help? ;)
[00:02:29] <Cork> mms_:  you should get something like range=%5B'1'%2C'2'%2C'3'%5D
[00:02:32] <mms_> Payload: range=%5B%221%22%2C%222%22%2C%225%22%5D
[00:02:35] <Myx0x3> its 70% shorter, hehe
[00:02:46] <badbandit> hello, I have just read this blog and I like the pattern used so I tried it out and got it working except for one part which is in the 2nd part where he makes a ListView object and sets a BindEvents() function on the prototype... I can get that to trigger on success, however it is the call to addData via $.proxy() which does not work
[00:02:50] <badbandit> http://floatleft.com/notebook/backbone-has-made-me-a-better-programmer
[00:02:51] <mms_> Cork: that string I pasted is that I got
[00:02:54] <Cork> mms_: ya, thats expected
[00:02:57] <Myx0x3> $() vs document.getelementbyid hehe
[00:03:04] <mms_> Cork: but its not invoking my method on cxf
[00:03:04] <Cork> your sending url encoded data
[00:03:04] <Myx0x3> even more then 70% maybe :P
[00:03:22] <badbandit> I was able to get it to work by doing .on('myModel:success', this.addData(this)) instead... anyone know why?
[00:03:47] <mms_> Cork: but then its not invoking my cxf jax-rs method
[00:04:35] <mms_> earlier code was able to invoke
[00:04:37] <Cork> mms_: does it expect www-form-urlencoded data?
[00:04:45] <mms_> Cork: no its expects json
[00:04:50] <Cork> pure json?
[00:04:52] <badbandit> or am I understanding .proxy wrong? the way it's written does that mean I have to explicitly call out the Object.addData() method to get a result?
[00:04:53] <mms_> Cork: application/json
[00:05:07] <Cork> mms_: then you need to overide the contnet-type for the response
[00:05:19] <Cork> *content-type
[00:05:31] <Bhavz> Hey guys, got referred here from ##javascript
[00:05:33] <mms_> Cork: I have set content type as application/json
[00:05:42] <Bhavz> I'm trying to figure out what's causing the major lag when Project/Profile is clicked. It's loading a page (with a fade in animation) in the div from nope.html/login.html.
[00:05:49] <mms_> 			contentType: "application/json",
[00:05:51] <Bhavz> http://devtest.bhavzproject.com/vu/tests/2/web.html
[00:06:01] <Bhavz> Link to the js file: http://devtest.bhavzproject.com/vu/tests/2/js/nav.js
[00:06:23] <Cork> mms_: have you checked what data your actually sending from the broser?
[00:07:27] <mms_> Cork: firebug shows range=%221%22
[00:07:38] <tipdbmp> How can I refer to each individual div in: $('.div-class').html($(this).donsntWork); // I don't have a callback function but I need to refer to each div, how?
[00:08:22] <Cork> mms_: i meant the headers
[00:08:32] <Lucky--> just use sammy.js
[00:08:37] <Lucky--> if u want to have a single page app
[00:08:38] <mms_> Cork: @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
[00:08:39] <Lucky--> so much easier
[00:08:41] <Cork> ?.each @ tipdbmp
[00:08:42] <bot-t> tipdbmp, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[00:08:49] <tipdbmp> tnx.
[00:08:52] <mms_> Cork: contentType is set part of ajax call
[00:08:56] <Cork> mms_: thats not the header
[00:09:14] <Cork> mms_: check the headers section in firebug
[00:09:23] <mms_> Cork: oh...should i need to use some different content type in service annotation ?
[00:09:36] <mms_> how do I set the header content type now ?
[00:09:39] <Cork> mms_: request headers
[00:10:29] <Cork> mms_: "Content-Type	application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8" is what it normally says
[00:10:41] <Cork> if you have that, thats one of the reasons why it fails
[00:11:05] <mms_> Cork: I am logging the input in catalina logs
[00:12:22] <mms_> Cork: http://pastebin.com/53sHxzwQ
[00:12:31] <mms_> content type is set fine
[00:13:00] <Cork> mms_: ok, then ya the JSON.stringify is what you need
[00:13:14] <mms_> Cork: again what i had was righ t?
[00:13:19] <Cork> ya
[00:13:27] <mms_> ok thanks
[00:13:32] <Cork> its just very uncommon for systems to be built like that
[00:14:39] <mms_> Cork: I am using cxf jaxrs
[00:15:44] <mms_> Cork: I think we meant jsonp
[00:15:55] <Cork> uh... what?
[00:16:10] <Cork> jsonp has almost nothing to do with what we've fiddled with
[00:16:18] <coldhead> cxf jaxrs just looks like you're mashing the keyboard
[00:16:21] <Cork> jsonp is a way to send json through a get request cross domains
[00:16:30] <Cork> coldhead: lol

[00:17:12] <earthw0rm> Hi, I have a few database tables and I want to use the contents as tags for the JQuery Tag-It widget with autocomplete, so for example placenames, postcodes and product types. The trouble is, if I then put them into the widget as tags, I don't know what table they were from. Then when I come to process the tab widgets contents, I'll have to work it out again so I know what table to link/tag the content with. Can anyo
[00:17:14] <earthw0rm> ne suggest a way around this?
[00:19:10] <earthw0rm> It's like the tab it widget needs a category
[00:20:40] <mms_> does this return a jquery list of values $('input[type="text"]', form).val()
[00:20:47] <Cork> no
[00:21:00] <coldhead> earthw0rm: could you create an object/associative array/dictionary with this form: var source = {'term1': 'table2', 'term2': 'table7', 'term8': 'table0'} ?
[00:21:19] <Cork> $.map($('input[type="text"]', form), function(elm) { return $(elm).val() }); does
[00:21:20] <coldhead> then you could just go var src = source[$input.val()] (or w/e)
[00:21:23] <coldhead> and find it out
[00:23:00] <mms_> Cork: cannot use each function ?
[00:23:39] <earthw0rm> coldhead: And submit that as the POST data for the form instead of the contents of the Tag-It widget?
[00:23:54] <coldhead> earthw0rm: that's a matter for yourself
[00:23:57] <coldhead> i'd probably submit both
[00:23:58] <Cork> mms_: sure if you prefer =>  var arr = []; $('input[type="text"]', form).each(function() { arr.push($(this).val()); }); arr
[00:24:14] <coldhead> but my point is that's the technique you could use to work out which table within the browser
[00:24:25] <mms_> Cork: got it
[00:24:39] <earthw0rm> coldhead: Yeah, I think that has to be the way to do it
[00:24:56] <earthw0rm> coldhead: Thanks for the tip!
[00:25:25] <Bhavz> anyone mind answering my question? a wee bit lost :/
[00:26:18] <coldhead> very welcome, earthw0rm. good luck!
[00:26:33] <coldhead> enjoy yon summit, ryanneufeld!
[00:26:54] <mms_> Cork: 			data: JSON.stringify({range: $.map( $('input[type="text"]', form), function(ele) { return ele.val(); } )  }),
[00:26:57] <mms_> does not work
[00:27:47] <Cork> mms_: what does the data in the stream look like?
[00:28:16] <mms_> Cork: its not posting at all
[00:28:23] <mms_> firebug also shows nothing
[00:28:26] <Cork> what error do you get?
[00:28:33] <mms_> no error either
[00:28:49] <Cork> uh...
[00:29:05] <retrostyle|15> hey dudes
[00:29:14] <mms_> Cork:  I am confused between java script object, jquery objects
[00:29:29] <retrostyle|15> is it possible to get a json string from an cross domain request without jsonp
[00:29:31] <Cork> mms_: there are no jquery objects
[00:29:52] <Cork> mms_: its just javascript objects generated by jquery, nothing special about them
[00:29:56] <mms_> Cork: ok
[00:30:07] <mms_> so code I tried looks valid ?
[00:30:19] <Cork> as far as i can tell
[00:30:28] <Cork> your sure the selector works?
[00:30:44] <mms_> let me check
[00:31:04] <seutje> but they are special, they poop rainbows and stuff
[00:32:45] <mms_> Cork: I am having to redploy to tomcat for every single change to test...any better way to test ?
[00:37:16] <mms_> ok that works now
[00:37:36] <mms_> I was using ele.val() instead of $(ele).val()
[00:38:26] <mms_> Cork: why cannot I use ele.val() ?
[00:40:00] <Cork> mms_: cause elm is the dom element
[00:41:16] <mms_> Cork: $( "input...", form) gave me jquery list of elements
[00:41:49] <Cork> ?tiys
[00:41:54] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find "tiys" in jQuery Docs.
[00:42:02] <Cork> mms_: just do what you want
[00:42:09] <mms_> ok thanks
[00:43:04] <UltraMC> Hi, why when clicking + ajax not loads content? http://jsfiddle.net/rzRSC/1/
[00:45:44] <seutje> UltraMC: because it's cross-domain
[00:46:01] <TheBrayn> how big of a sin is it to reorder html elements by dynamically setting their properties with jquery?
[00:47:52] <Cork> TheBrayn: setting properties?
[00:48:03] <Cork> TheBrayn: what property are you talking about?
[00:49:45] <mms_> Cork:  you checked that jsonp url on cxf site ? I think thats is to do with binary json
[00:50:49] <Cork> mms_: your not doing jsonp
[00:51:19] <Cork> make sure what the term means before using it
[00:51:25] <mms_> Cork:  I know but since earlier we saw that urlencoded string being sent across I guess it related to jsonp ?
[00:51:37] <Cork> uh.. no
[00:52:44] <mms_> Cork: no reading now !
[00:53:24] <TheBrayn> Cork: css properties
[00:53:53] <Cork> TheBrayn: properties isn't a css keyword
[00:54:12] <mms_> cross domain json request : jsonp
[00:54:26] <Cork> sure, but you can't do post cross domain
[00:54:31] <UltraMC> seutjre its not the case. its not loading even if local
[00:54:37] <Cork> jsonp is a workaround for cross domain json GET
[00:55:39] <Cork> UltraMC: local == you've added the html file on www.google.pl/my-test-file.html ?
[00:56:15] <Cork> i kinda doubt you have ftp access to www.google.pl :)
[00:56:19] <UltraMC> Cork I want to load my page from the same server, google.com was only for example ouh. It not loads anything anyway
[00:56:42] <badbandit> hey, could anyone with ajax knowledge help me? how could I retrieve the returned "data" from the "xhrDataModel:success" in this way? http://hastebin.com/yojefebewu.vhdl
[00:56:46] <UltraMC> What I want to do to add a DIV on top of DIV with +
[00:57:25] <badbandit> in this case for testing I just have it returning a snippet of html, but that alert is showing an object, my server shows a 200 POST, console shows the post with the html

[00:58:04] <bot-t> Cork, VML + IE + jQuery = "Failed" - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 2 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4723
[00:58:08] <Cork> LOL
[00:58:15] <Cork> UltraMC: Works For Me
[00:58:23] <UltraMC> Cork not for me -.- what browser?
[00:58:34] <Cork> did you check the link i sent you?
[00:58:40] <Cork> UltraMC: http://jsfiddle.net/rzRSC/6/ <--
[00:58:57] <UltraMC> Cork nothing happens on clicking +
[00:59:15] <Cork> cause the response isn't something that can be added to the dom
[00:59:20] <Cork> but the call happens
[00:59:25] <Cork> check your network tab
[01:00:16] <Cork> UltraMC: a better example http://jsfiddle.net/rzRSC/7/
[01:00:40] <UltraMC> Cork thnx!
[01:00:57] <UltraMC> what u changed?
[01:01:01] <Cork> the url
[01:01:31] <Cork> i removed the unneeded part of your selector too
[01:01:40] <Cork> but thats just cause your doing extra work the way you did it
[01:01:51] <Cork> UltraMC: never have selectors to the left of id's
[01:02:01] <Cork> its pointless, id's are uniq
[01:02:04] <UltraMC> like?
[01:02:12] <Cork> div #konsola
[01:02:17] <Cork> just do #konsola
[01:03:03] <Cork> all you do is make the page find all divs on the page, then from that range find the uniq id, instead of just finding the uniq id
[01:03:18] <UltraMC> Cork, what I get is "/ajax.html. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.Ä™
[01:03:46] <Cork> so your doing cross domain?
[01:03:55] <UltraMC> No
[01:04:03] <UltraMC> $("#konsola").load('ajax.html');
[01:04:03] <Cork> Access-Control-Allow-Origin is for cross domain
[01:05:48] <UltraMC> The problem was as you stated before cross-domaining. I wasnt doing cross domain but instaed of running it from localhost i did it as file//
[01:06:32] <Cork> that means its cross domain
[01:07:00] <Tram> Hey all, iam trying out a jquery animation. The first time i click it it works fine, however  i made a reset function aswell, which works. But after using the reset (.stop()) function i cant start the animation again, anyone knows how to fix that? http://jsfiddle.net/MartvanKoolwijk/4tREZ/
[01:07:51] <Cork> Tram: your binding a new event listener that from that time on stops the animation
[01:08:45] <UltraMC> How to use function that is defined in $(document).ready outside of $(document).ready _
[01:08:53] <Cork> you can't
[01:09:08] <Cork> you can attach it to window.function_name
[01:09:10] <Tram> Cork, i dont really understand what you mean
[01:09:18] <UltraMC> Cork ok its the same example: After clicking + added content has no "eventListeners" attached
[01:09:30] <Cork> Tram: sorry read it a bit wrong
[01:09:50] <Cork> or rather no
[01:10:01] <Cork> Tram: click isn't a live listener
[01:10:11] <Cork> it binds on the element that the selector matches in that given time
[01:10:20] <UltraMC> Cork well... The + button works just once - thats the case
[01:10:21] <Cork> so removing the class doens't remove the listener
[01:10:53] <jcbk> If I have 2 instances of the same form, and I want to post both of them using $.ajax(), how do I keep them separated? So the result is [field 1, field 2] [field 1, field2] rather than [field 1, field1, field2, field2]
[01:13:09] <Cork> Tram: http://jsfiddle.net/4tREZ/3/
[01:13:46] <Tram> thanks Cork
[01:14:06] <Cork> Tram: you can remove the container class if you like, it doesn't affect the running code
[01:15:04] <Cork> Tram: http://jsfiddle.net/4tREZ/4/
[01:15:35] <Cork> oh, btw you can combind the two selectors in if hasClass case
[01:15:45] <UltraMC> Why this errors: $("#konsola").append(load('ajax.html')); ? Uncaught ReferenceError: load is not defined
[01:15:46] <Cork> no point doing that class selection
[01:15:50] <Tram> cool thanks alot Cork
[01:16:20] <Cork> UltraMC: cause load isn't a function, its a member on the jquery object;
[01:16:32] <Cork> UltraMC: and it won't return the content of the html file
[01:16:34] <UltraMC> Cork how to append AJAX result?
[01:16:41] <Cork> thats what load does
[01:16:50] <UltraMC> add selector to load?
[01:17:08] <Cork> $("#konsola").load('ajax.html');
[01:17:31] <Cork> that will do a $().get() and try to append the returned html to the selector
[01:18:23] <Cork> $("#konsola").load('ajax.html'); is a shorthand for $.get('ajax.html', function(data) { $("#konsola").html(data); })
[01:18:36] <Cork> ah, wait you want to append it
[01:18:40] <Cork> you can't do that with load
[01:18:45] <nisseni> I live in sweden where we use , instead of . as decimal. So when the user is about to calculate something with jquery, they write for example 1,4 * 1,5 - do I really have to make a replace like so (for each of the fields): http://pastie.org/private/ek4wkhd2hvmcfcfovc0eog - or is there an easier way?
[01:18:55] <Cork> UltraMC: $.get('ajax.html', function(data) { $("#konsola").append(data); })
[01:19:11] <Cork> nisseni: yes
[01:19:19] <Cork> (you need to)
[01:19:38] <Cork> like in almost all other languages
[01:20:08] <Cork> [1,4,1,5] would be a bit hard to parse correctly :)
[01:22:25] <nisseni> Cork: well, it's not really like that, sorry for confusing - I have multiple fields where they put in data, when they click "Calculate" it calculates the number... but I guess I need to replace and make them floats or something?
[01:23:35] <Cork> nisseni: i was a little ironic; but my point is, javascript is in english, so if you want it to understand you need to express it like that
[01:23:59] <Cork> comma is a list delimiter, and dot is for decimals
[01:24:04] <nisseni> Cork: I understand, just don't want to accept it, so freaking time consuming :)
[01:24:09] <Cork> :)
[01:24:26] <Cork> nisseni: ya, been there done that
[01:25:05] <Cork> (its even funnier with macs that replaces - with —)
[01:25:21] <mytoz> nisseni: I really think it is quite dumb that we use comma instead of dot for decimals :)
[01:25:26] * mytoz is a fellow Swede
[01:25:33] <Cork> ya, same here
[01:25:46] <Cork> the "long date" format is even dumber
[01:25:56] <mytoz> date-month-year?
[01:25:57] <Cork> (why the freeking "den " in there???
[01:26:00] <mytoz> ah, yeah
[01:26:16] <mytoz> we have a lot of dumb stuff
[01:26:21] <Cork> :D
[01:27:01] <mytoz> lots of those little idiosyncrasies
[01:27:03] <nisseni> so let me get this straight, the only guys talking now is from sweden, but we still speak english? :)
[01:27:21] <nisseni> channel rules I guess
[01:27:23] <mytoz> yup
[01:27:26] <Cork> sure, cause thats the language of the channel
[01:27:35] <mytoz> it's good manners if someone else wants to join in the conversation
[01:27:44] * Cork nods
[01:28:26] <abletony84> At my dropdown menu at http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/Rz6pn/ - is there a way to make the dropdown appear instantly on hover? Right now there's a tiny delay.
[01:28:28] <shoky> you don't really think with 800 people in the channel you are the only 3 observing the conversation ;>
[01:28:29] <abletony84> The dropdown is using hoverIntent instead of regular hover (http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html).
[01:28:46] <mytoz> shoky: good point
[01:28:47] <mytoz> :)
[01:31:47] <shoky> abletony84: uhh.. don't use hoverIntent ?
[01:39:30] <UltraMC> Why this fails: var input = '<strong>test</strong>'; $("#konsola").appendTo(input); ?
[01:40:10] <Cork> append not appendTo
[01:40:23] <Cork> you trying to append #konsola to the text string
[01:40:29] <UltraMC> Cork, but I want to inser result INSIDE a given selector
[01:40:39] <UltraMC> insert*
[01:40:58] <bobsapp> its append bro check the documentation
[01:41:05] <Cork> you want to move #konsola inside strong?
[01:41:33] <Cork> cause if input would be a dom element, thats what your asking to do
[01:42:00] <bobsapp> didnt he define the variable input
[01:42:16] <bobsapp> really he shouldnt make a string named input its quite confusing
[01:42:40] <Cork> var input = '<strong>test</strong>'; <-- thats just a string; var input = $('<strong>test</strong>') would be a dom element, that was my point
[01:43:03] <Cork> but i don't think thats what he wants to do
[01:43:40] <bobsapp> UltraMC: put the code on jsfiddle ?
[01:44:13] <UltraMC> bobsapp, I will try first do it by mylsef, truth is im learning this thing
[01:46:10] <UltraMC> I must say that when I discovered jQuery I was like =OOO
[01:53:21] <UltraMC> What;s fastest way of firing function when ENTER is pressed?
[01:56:18] <shoky> UltraMC: keyup/keydown/keypress depending on exact effect desired. or maybe 'submit' if its a form..
[01:56:32] <UltraMC> shoky but only for ENTER key
[01:56:42] <shoky> UltraMC: doesn't matter what key
[01:57:01] <shoky> unless you're talking about a form
[01:57:57] <shoky> UltraMC: you can check which key was pressed inside the function
[01:58:26] <shoky> event.which==13  means it's enter key
[02:06:10] <Cork> UltraMC: if its for an input form you should do it by listening on the form tag for submit
[02:06:37] <UltraMC> Cork any docs about it?
[02:06:46] <Cork> ?.submit
[02:06:47] <bot-t> .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[02:07:19] <Cork> if your using an input, you should always have a form around it
[02:07:52] <Cork> browsers has so much special code, so the page will more or less always seam broken in one of them if you try to reproduce it your self
[02:08:05] <Cork> (unless you add the spacial cases your self in code)
[02:09:18] <bobsapp> good unit ^
[02:11:45] <Trisox> guys how would you do this http://jsfiddle.net/ZTLWa/1/ on error rebind plugin
[02:13:07] <Cork> Trisox: don't unbind, set a state variable and check that
[02:13:22] <Trisox> noted
[02:13:28] <Trisox> but the one click part
[02:13:44] <Trisox> its ONE click but if ajax fails it need to be rebinded
[02:13:48] <Trisox> the one click
[02:14:00] <Cork> so don't use one
[02:14:29] <Trisox> no i need to ;)
[02:14:31] <Cork> unbind it on success, block it while an ajax call is active
[02:14:42] <Cork> and remove the block on error
[02:14:48] <Trisox> no i dont want more then one ajax call
[02:15:01] <Cork> uh.. thats the "block" part....
[02:15:22] <Trisox> how would you block it
[02:15:24] <Trisox> sugestion?
[02:15:47] <Cork> do you want to allow one ajax call per element (like your doing now) or just one ajax call in total for the plugin?
[02:16:00] <Trisox> one per element
[02:16:25] <Trisox> i could set data  or something
[02:16:41] <Trisox> once clicked
[02:16:44] <Cork> if($this.data('ajaxThingy-pending')) { return; } $this.data('ajaxThingy-pending', true);
[02:17:04] <Cork> and in the error/success call $this.removeData('ajaxThingy-pending')
[02:17:16] <Trisox> yea right
[02:29:43] <Trisox> Cork like this ? http://jsfiddle.net/ZTLWa/5/
[02:29:52] <magnetik> Hi
[02:29:59] <magnetik> I have a question regarding the jew jquery UI tooltip
[02:30:37] <Cork> Trisox: ya, but you prob want to remove the event listener on success, if you never want to use it again
[02:30:52] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/ZTLWa/6/
[02:30:53] <Cork> Trisox: or actually, scratch that, use a delegated event listener instead
[02:30:54] <Trisox> got it
[02:31:20] <Trisox> its used with ajax
[02:31:23] <Trisox> and getscript
[02:31:31] <magnetik> I want to have a tooltip next to an input which display the content of the input modified. I'm using this : http://pastebin.com/fwxJyPkJ
[02:31:43] <Trisox> rebinded every time.. ajax finished
[02:31:57] <magnetik> It works fine when I change the focus to another element and back to the input but not when the page loads
[02:32:24] <magnetik> let me rephrase: it works the I add content to the input, change the focus and get back into the input
[02:32:30] <magnetik> but not directly
[02:35:37] <UltraMC> Why my dialog style is so big? http://www.multiplayerminecraft.pl/jquery/
[02:35:54] <UltraMC> Its all from here http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-confirmation
[02:38:53] <seutje> UltraMC: it's exactly the same size, and the inner styles are dependent on your own CSS
[02:39:16] <UltraMC> seutje, but I dont define any css for this!
[02:40:15] <seutje> UltraMC: jQuery UI's font sizes are relative
[02:40:23] <UltraMC> relative to what?
[02:40:34] <seutje> UltraMC: the demo site defines a font-size of 62.5% on the body
[02:40:37] <seutje> you, do not
[02:40:58] <seutje> so you get 1em of 100% instead of 1em of 62.5%
[02:41:17] <UltraMC> seutje, where you can see that 62.5?
[02:41:32] <seutje> http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/style.css
[02:41:56] <UltraMC> seutje, wow it works, thank you!
[02:45:09] <magnetik> http://jsfiddle.net/XjbrF/2/
[02:45:22] <magnetik> The tooltip does not shows the first time, not any clue why
[02:46:00] <markus__> hy. i use .click to get the clicks on a div. but the event comes to often. what am i doing false?
[02:47:41] <seutje> magnetik: I don't need to lose focus to get the tooltip to show, just hover mouse over it again
[02:48:50] <magnetik> seutje: hum, yep. I would prefer to have it always when the user have the focus on the input
[02:49:01] <magnetik> not depending on the mouse position
[02:50:41] <abletony84> With hoverIntent (http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html) - why is there a delay when hovering? I understand why there's a lag when unhovering, I mean that's what hoverIntent is for, but when hovering?
[02:50:45] <abletony84> http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/Rz6pn/
[02:51:13] <shoky> abletony84:    However, instead of immediately calling the onMouseOver function, it waits until the user's mouse slows down enough before making the call.
[02:52:33] <keirlav87> whats the best way to check if a property exists within an object?
[02:52:52] <magnetik> Updated demand: http://jsfiddle.net/magnetik/XjbrF/3/
[02:52:54] <seutje> magnetik: http://jsfiddle.net/XjbrF/4/
[02:53:12] <Cork> keirlav87: object.keyname === undefined
[02:53:36] <Cork> or !== if you prefer that
[02:53:38] <abletony84> shoky: hmmm.. shouldnt it only do this when unhovering?
[02:53:41] <keirlav87> without typeof preceding the object.keyname?
[02:53:44] <magnetik> seutje: humm great!
[02:53:49] <magnetik> thank you so much
[02:53:52] <Cork> keirlav87: yes
[02:53:57] <shoky> abletony84: i quoted that from the description of hoverIntent plugin
[02:54:08] <shoky> abletony84: so i assume it is supposed to do what is in the description
[02:54:12] <abletony84> ah..
[02:54:31] <Nancy2012> my refresh parent tab wouldn't work â€¦ http://jsfiddle.net/d3yCk/
[02:54:38] <seutje> magnetik: http://jsfiddle.net/XjbrF/6/ there
[02:54:40] <Cork> ?eval var o = {  }; if(o.none === undefined) { print('nothing here'); } else { print('found'); }
[02:54:44] <abletony84> yeah i totally get why it does all this calculation when _unhovering_ to prevent accidental unhovers from happening
[02:54:45] <bot-t> Cork: "nothing here"
[02:55:02] <Nancy2012> i am using an iframeâ€¦ and i want to refresh only the parent div where all contents are savedâ€¦
[02:55:12] <shoky> abletony84: for the same reasons, it does it when hovering..
[02:55:53] <magnetik> seutje: that even more awesome, thanks again
[02:56:13] <seutje> Nancy2012: refresh, or change its contents?
[02:57:20] <keirlav87> it's not working for me, i'll make a quick pastebin to outline the results i'm getting
[02:57:51] <abletony84> shoky: gonna mail the author
[02:57:57] <abletony84> ill keep u posted, thanks
[02:57:58] <shoky> :\
[02:58:15] <shoky> "hi why does your plugin do what its supposed to"
[02:58:29] <Cork> lol
[02:58:31] <seutje> "this does what's on the tin, sup with that?"
[02:58:54] <Nancy2012> Refresh the div â€¦
[02:59:08] <seutje> divs don't refresh afaik
[02:59:17] <Nancy2012> actually.. i am using an iframe on the overlay popupâ€¦
[02:59:17] <abletony84> "Hello! With hoverIntent - why is there a delay when hovering? I understand why there's a delay when unhovering, but for the hovering itself, to me at least this causes some frustration UX-wise, what do you think?
[02:59:22] <abletony84> By the way, any news on hoverIntent r7?" --abletony84
[02:59:31] <shoky> lol@what do you think
[02:59:55] <abletony84> :P
[02:59:56] <shoky> abletony84: it does the delay when hovering so that it won't call your callback unless the user actually stops his cursor on the element
[03:00:24] <Nancy2012> so once i added a new values â€¦ i want that it would load on the parent div ..
[03:00:25] <shoky> so that if you move your cursor across the element but you dont stop on it, it wont call your callback (e.g. wont flash the menu for an instant)
[03:00:25] <Nancy2012> i don't want to refresh the whole page
[03:00:37] <Nancy2012> because i am using jquery tab
[03:01:04] <Nancy2012> so if i do refresh the whole page.. i lost some of the values .. because i am on edit pageâ€¦
[03:01:34] <Nancy2012> so solution would be the refresh only the div where all contents are taken places...
[03:01:40] <abletony84> shoky: hmmm..
[03:02:47] <abletony84> shoky: well this hoverIntent will save my users from going "damnit!! i accidentally unhovered this dropdown now i gotta rehover it..".. but that delay when hovering will just make them go "huh? its not a dropd.. oh ok there it is"
[03:03:19] <shoky> you can try throttling the mouseleave event
[03:03:24] <abletony84> that little "huh? its not a dropd.." moment might cost me a lot of money
[03:03:25] <shoky> er not throttling
[03:03:44] <shoky> donno the term but i'd just code that myself :\
[03:04:18] <abletony84> :D
[03:05:01] <shoky> or, you could use the hoverIntent only with the 'out' option
[03:05:05] <shoky> no?
[03:05:09] <keirlav87> http://jsfiddle.net/zyRCF/5/
[03:05:27] <Nancy2012> I want to reload or refresh the parent div content from an Iframe â€¦.
[03:05:49] <keirlav87> CORK: would you mind taking a look at that fiddle please - when i submit the form I get 'can't convert undefined to object' even though that part should be skipped by the conditional?
[03:06:03] <Already> After something happens int he iframe Nancy2012?
[03:06:17] <Nancy2012> yesâ€¦.
[03:06:54] <Nancy2012> on iframe.. i am updated the values of parent div content..
[03:07:06] <Nancy2012> i don't want to refresh the whole page.. becauseâ€¦
[03:07:12] <shoky> abletony84: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Rz6pn/3/
[03:07:23] <Nancy2012> i lost the other values
[03:07:45] <Nancy2012> Already: u got me?
[03:09:15] <Already> I wonder if that's possible. You're dealing with two seperate window objects if i'm not mistaken and i'm not sure one window can communicate with another window. You might be able to use some kind of server "bridge". Meaning call something via AJAX on the server from the iframe and preiodically check if something happend on the main window.
[03:09:24] <abletony84> good lord almighty shoky !! what the hell..
[03:09:58] <abletony84> shoky: nice!
[03:10:20] * abletony84 is unable to control his passion and starts dancing around
[03:10:38] * abletony84 sees Nancy2012 grabs her and starts french kissing
[03:10:48] <shoky> abletony84: actually it doesn't work so good ;p
[03:10:51] <mms_> http://jsfiddle.net/imiten/CGhgF/1/ ...is this right way to add row to table...I see empty rows being added
[03:11:09] * abletony84 is now playing: Riley Does The Booty Dance On Boondocks - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7g8afjOzAI
[03:11:16] <abletony84> shoky: it doesnt?
[03:11:19] <shoky> nope
[03:11:35] <shoky> sometimes the menus aren't removed
[03:11:39] <abletony84> how come?
[03:11:41] <abletony84> hmm
[03:11:49] <abletony84> oh yeah i see it..
[03:12:21] <keirlav87> because the out isn't fired until after the 'in' executed i think even though the in callback does nothing
[03:12:41] <shoky> ya someth like that
[03:14:10] <mms_> I am iterating over json list items and am not sure if I am doing it right.
[03:14:43] <keirlav87> can anyone see why i get typeerror when i submit this form, even though the part that is causing the error should be overlooked by a conditional? http://jsfiddle.net/zyRCF/5/
[03:14:53] <shoky> mms_: first of all don't do  $(tr)
[03:15:01] <shoky> mms_: tr is already a jquery object
[03:15:24] <shoky> mms_: you don't need .eq(0) if selecting by id
[03:16:18] <mms_> well as I append rows it will add more td with same id ? so I should not use this method then ...
[03:16:28] <shoky> you shouldn't be doing that either ;)
[03:16:41] <shoky> id's should be unique
[03:16:49] <mms_> shoky: instead I should just add with <td> + item + </td>
[03:17:05] <Heather_> hmm im trying to come up with best approach to create a reply textarea that is assigned a specific commentid. Should I create a template and clone it at reply link click? If so how can i assign the commentid to it?
[03:17:07] <mms_> let me try that
[03:17:40] <shoky> mms_: you should be using classes, not id's , for elements that you're gonna clone
[03:18:05] <mms_> shoky: ok...is this better tr.add("<td>" + data.symbol + "</td>");
[03:18:26] <mms_> will data.symbol be valid
[03:19:00] <shoky> mms_: also you should do:  .each(function(i, data) { ...
[03:19:05] <shoky> the first argument is index
[03:19:13] <mms_> ok
[03:19:24] <UltraMC> I have problem with swichClass - http://www.multiplayerminecraft.pl/jquery/ - hover around blue div (it works!), click on it and press ENTER - new div will be added - hover it (it fails :( ) why?
[03:19:54] <shoky> mms_: you wan't .append not .add
[03:20:08] <shoky> mms_: and.. i didn't say you need to do it like that
[03:20:12] <shoky> but that's fine
[03:20:14] <mms_> ok
[03:20:16] <mms_> will append
[03:20:50] <keirlav87> is there a way to rename an object property?
[03:22:23] <shoky> keirlav87: i'm not getting any errors in your fiddle
[03:23:10] <keirlav87> you don't get 'TypeError: can't convert undefined to object'?
[03:23:18] <shoky> oh, i was submitting with non-empty values
[03:23:44] <shoky> uh
[03:23:55] <shoky> i think delete should be used for object properties ?
[03:24:18] <shoky> nvm.
[03:24:56] <keirlav87> it is, it should delete any empty properties from formData.additionalDetails / formData.updateDetails
[03:25:13] <shoky> keirlav87:  why do you think the conditional shouldn't go there?
[03:25:26] <shoky> formData.additionalDetails is defined
[03:25:45] <keirlav87> yeah but formData.updateDetails isn't, which is where the delete statement is being fired
[03:25:56] <shoky> no, the second one is fired
[03:26:00] <keirlav87> first :p
[03:26:00] <shoky> here, at least
[03:26:13] <shoky> nope.
[03:27:08] <abletony84> shoky: what do u think of those search bars whose inputs extend when you click on them?
[03:27:13] <clocKwize> hey
[03:27:16] <abletony84> annoying or cool or..
[03:27:16] <jcbk> can someone have a look here? I'm trying to turn the values of all forms on a page into JSON format, but they I want to group them by form... http://jsfiddle.net/du3RG/
[03:27:24] <keirlav87> http://jsfiddle.net/zyRCF/7/
[03:27:27] <keirlav87> still being fired
[03:27:48] <shoky> right.. it's defined
[03:29:49] <keirlav87> lol yeah, bad example
[03:30:44] <keirlav87> i've confused myself now though - why am i getting can't convert null to object then?
[03:30:48] <shoky> abletony84: i don't have an opinion regarding the idea.. its the implementation that matters
[03:31:08] <shoky> keirlav87: you're looping over additionalDetails but deleting from updateDetails
[03:31:26] <keirlav87> LOL
[03:31:35] <shoky> :p
[03:31:41] <keirlav87> how long have you been looking at that without saying anything :P
[03:31:54] <keirlav87> thanks btw
[03:31:58] <shoky> you were not asking about the reason for the exception ;(0
[03:32:00] <shoky> er, ;)
[03:32:09] <abletony84> cool thx..
[03:32:10] <shoky> you just asekd about the logic of the conditionals ;)
[03:32:21] <jcbk> oh, made 1 mistake in the wanted result. still, I'd like to know how to iterate over all forms on a page and serializeArray() them, rather than gathering them in 1 object like $('form').serializeArray() does: http://jsfiddle.net/du3RG/1/
[03:32:34] <keirlav87> thats where copy and paste code gets you - even 4 lines is dangerous
[03:32:53] <shoky> aye
[03:35:47] <Already> Hmmm is there a standard function to reload only a portion of a page?
[03:36:07] <sente> that'd be nice
[03:36:20] <Already> It seems like that's what Nancy2012 is looking for. But i can't think of another solution than having some kind of AJAX call.
[03:36:55] <quicksilver> you can use $.load
[03:36:59] <quicksilver> and yes, it is some kind of AJAX.
[03:37:09] <shoky> ajax is meant for this..
[03:37:18] <quicksilver> as you say, that's all it can be
[03:37:20] <dziegler> <Already> u can use Events. item.on -> do some or us use some like SetInterval
[03:38:43] <Already> quicksilver still that would load the whole document and not just a portion of it, right?
[03:38:58] <mms_> shoky: I have json in which for Change field there is "0.00" and data.Change is giving me null
[03:39:10] <quicksilver> Already: no.
[03:39:15] <mms_> where can I paste json output ? pastebin ?
[03:39:17] <shoky> Already: ideally your server will respond with only what you need
[03:39:23] <shoky> mms_: yes
[03:39:24] <quicksilver> Already: or rather, there are options to make it only load part of it
[03:39:26] <quicksilver> if you want to
[03:39:26] <mms_> ok
[03:39:39] <Already> Nancy2012 you should be reading this as well. ;)
[03:40:31] <dziegler> Already: Nop, u have a single place wich get reload. <div id="reload">reload Me :-)</div> | Now u do your axaj-Request and make some like $('#reload').innerHTML=response.Text
[03:41:17] <mms_> shoky: I choose javascript for syntax on pastebin ? since I do not see json
[03:41:27] <shoky> mms_: yea ;]
[03:42:01] <shoky> mms_: might need to see your code too, i believe you that there's a Change field ;]
[03:42:20] <mms_> shoky:  there is
[03:42:29] <mms_> its from json
[03:42:37] <mms_> http://pastebin.com/z87xVjHv
[03:43:01] <mms_> I am using yahoo finance to do an example
[03:43:03] <shoky> uhm
[03:43:13] <shoky> Change isn't a top-level field, as far as i can tell
[03:43:26] <mms_> shoky: it shows fields as such but for few it shows undefined, null etc.
[03:43:56] <mms_> like for Change shows undefined
[03:44:09] <mms_> for LastTradeTime shows null
[03:44:25] <shoky> you'd need something like..  data.query.results.quote[0].Change
[03:44:59] <letweet> so I'm working on my first jump into json ... everything appears to work right, except the data I'm getting back is empty
[03:45:19] <shoky> mms_: oh right you are looping over it
[03:45:27] <mms_> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/imiten/CGhgF/2/  ...my code
[03:45:39] <Pymous> Hello !
[03:45:43] <Pymous> Using this code : http://pastebin.com/NRW719y0
[03:45:53] <Pymous> How can I access an inside function from the oustide of the function ?
[03:46:20] <Pymous> Like the method : create_choice
[03:47:40] <Already> Thanks to everyone who helped out.
[03:47:45] <mms_> based on json data and code I do not understand why it shows undefined for Change field
[03:48:30] <mms_> shows null for LastTradeTime even though I use ne function
[03:48:50] <mazzachre> I can't quite figure the data() api out... I have some event handlers that sets and removes data elements. Can I start by doing var data = $(this).data(); and manipulate the data variable or do I need to fetch, set and remove each piece of data individually to allow them to function together?
[03:51:05] <shoky> mms_: you're not adding the columns in the right order ?
[03:51:47] <mms_> may be let me check...earlier I was picking by id and then I stopped using it
[03:51:50] <mms_> let me verify
[03:51:58] <shoky> mms_: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/CGhgF/3/
[03:52:16] <shoky> you had the wrong order
[03:52:27] <mms_> shoky: you right
[03:53:45] <shoky> mms_: first thing you should've done is:  console.log(data)   and look at the actual object in the console
[03:54:33] <shoky> cause then you know it's just a bug with how you updated the table
[03:54:43] <shoky> and not with the ajax part
[03:55:06] <mms_> shoky: ok...I thought console.log was mere for seeing json ...which I thought I can see in json tab....
[03:55:32] <shoky> console.log is for seeing any objects you have in your javascript code
[03:55:49] <shoky> when you have an object in JS, it's not JSON anymore
[03:56:14] <shoky> it was JSON while travelling ;p
[03:56:35] <shoky> also what's a json tab ;S
[04:00:17] <keirlav87> json tab in firebug for xhr responses
[04:01:47] <grouser> Hello, i am using a draggable ui, it is possible set the offset only inside the div container, if i have a container and i set an offset ignores the container
[04:03:40] <mms_> I want to select tr from table but not to select tr which has th has child
[04:03:52] <mms_> th as child I mean
[04:04:09] <mms_> I want to leave header row table as it is and clear rest of table
[04:04:29] <mms_> what jquery selector to use ?
[04:05:39] <mms_> $("table tr").not("th") ...will that work
[04:05:42] <keirlav87> $('tr').not('tr > th').empty() might work?
[04:06:10] <shoky> .not(':has(th)')
[04:06:39] <mms_> shoky: I do get that :has
[04:06:41] <shoky> but if you just want all but the first row..  $('table tr').slice(1)
[04:07:16] <mms_> shoky: I though has is function
[04:07:22] <shoky> it's both
[04:07:37] <shoky> just like not
[04:08:00] <shoky> so of course you could also do $('table tr:not(:has(th))')
[04:08:20] <shoky> but if you just structure your table properly
[04:08:35] <shoky> you could just do $('table tbody tr')
[04:09:02] <mms_> ok thead will have the tr/th
[04:09:07] <shoky> ye
[04:09:12] <mms_> ok let me do that
[04:11:12] <mms_> shoky: thanks...so far all good...see you later...bye
[04:11:15] <mms_> bye guys
[04:11:17] <shoky> mazzachre: didn't understand your question
[04:12:48] <shoky> mazzachre: oh. you can do what you say i think, no need to pull each item individually
[04:15:57] <Cork> mazzachre: yes, you need to call data for each key you want to fetch
[04:16:09] <Cork> mazzachre: an option is to store an object in data and just use that object
[04:16:28] <UltraMC> How to hide #DIALOG1 and ensure that it will be displayed only with dialog box?   http://jsfiddle.net/eQs4U/
[04:16:50] <Cork> mazzachre: $self.data('nfo', {}); $self.data('nfo').key = value;
[04:18:15] <Cork> UltraMC: just make it display: none; by default
[04:18:28] <seutje> UltraMC: why bother making a jsfiddle if you're just gonna dump the entire page in there and not properly reference your assets? :(
[04:18:31] <UltraMC> by default you mean in CSS or in JS?
[04:18:38] <shoky> Cork: why do you need to call it for each key ?
[04:18:42] <Cork> UltraMC: css
[04:18:56] <Cork> shoky: cause of how its stored in jquery
[04:19:06] <shoky> it's stored as an object?
[04:19:26] <UltraMC> Thnx
[04:19:27] <Cork> its stored in an object with the dom element as the key
[04:19:37] <Cork> and the parameter you pass is used to look it up
[04:19:51] <shoky> but there is a seperate clean object for each element
[04:19:54] <shoky> that's what .data() returns
[04:19:59] <shoky> (with no arguments)
[04:20:15] <Cork> if pure data actually returns an object now days, thats something new
[04:20:25] <Cork> it didn't a while back
[04:20:36] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/TV9xH/
[04:21:08] <Cork> interesting
[04:21:22] <shoky> from .data() docs: Calling .data() with no parameters retrieves all of the values as a JavaScript object. This object can be safely cached in a variable as long as a new object is not set with .data(obj). Using the object directly to get or set values is faster than making individual calls to .data() to get or set each value
[04:21:23] <Cork> thats quite a good improvement
[04:21:51] <Cork> that said, i would still argue that its a good idea to scope your data in the data object
[04:22:00] <shoky> yep for sured
[04:22:02] <shoky> -d
[04:22:11] <Cork> but ya, i've missed that change
[04:50:55] <MalMen> hello
[04:51:18] <MalMen> anyone know a good jquery plugin for a soap client ?
[04:51:28] <MalMen> i found this one http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/jqSOAPClient but is unable to download
[04:52:02] <Cork> ouch, soap in js :s
[04:52:13] <MalMen> Cork is a bad option ? :x
[04:52:25] <Cork> well its a fairly complex system
[04:52:29] <MalMen> i dont like the idea too, but its a my boss request
[04:52:29] <UltraMC> How to center buttons in dialog?
[04:52:48] <Cork> and unless you really need to have the client side validation of the data, i would prob look at something else
[04:53:00] <MalMen> like what ?
[04:53:15] <Cork> depends on what you need, if your looking for speed json
[04:53:33] <Cork> its by far the fastest format to send data in (both client and server side)
[04:54:34] <MalMen> and using jquery
[04:54:42] <MalMen> you know any lib that i can use ?
[04:54:52] <Cork> JSON.parse, JSON.stringify
[04:54:56] <Cork> its built into the browser
[04:55:13] <Cork> you will need the json2 lib for older ie's
[04:55:24] <Cork> ?g json2.js
[04:55:28] <bot-t> Cork, douglascrockford/JSON-js · GitHub - https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
[04:56:16] <top> does anyone know good libs for google maps?
[04:56:20] <MalMen> its fro using with phonegap
[04:57:47] <Cork> you mean phonegap compiled to web ?
[04:58:02] <MalMen> yes
[04:58:06] <Cork> top: whats wrong with the lib google provides?
[04:58:18] <Cork> MalMen: donno never done that
[04:58:55] <Lucky--> woops just spent 6 hours debugging why my input values were being erased on input, accidentally had 5 inputs in knockout bound to same observable lol.
[05:01:59] <djsounds02> Hello guys I need a bit of assistance I have a dropdown on a form that has too many rows to fit on the page could I get it to automatically go into different rows?
[05:02:35] <djsounds02> http://costapropertiesforsale.com/
[05:02:37] <Cork> dropdown? you mean a <select> element?
[05:03:05] <Cork> ah
[05:03:10] <djsounds02> Cork: yes sorry
[05:03:13] <djsounds02> on town
[05:03:19] <djsounds02> can you see that?
[05:03:33] <Cork> no your replacing a select element with a styled js replacement
[05:04:10] <Cork> it need to either have a max-height for the ul, or calculate the visible area below it and limit to that
[05:04:30] <djsounds02> then it will seperate into different columns?
[05:04:34] <Cork> max-height is what the normal select element does
[05:04:39] <Cork> no
[05:05:02] <Cork> to get two columns you would have to modify the plugin
[05:05:07] <djsounds02> will put a scrollbar?
[05:05:28] <Cork> prob, but you might have to do some small modifications to the css
[05:06:25] <Cork> max-height: 10rem; overflow: auto; should make it work quite well
[05:08:53] <djsounds02> Cork: thanks for that
[05:09:02] <djsounds02> bloody long list haha
[05:09:06] <Cork> np
[05:09:18] <djsounds02> I hadnt considered the scroll option
[05:09:22] <djsounds02> just different columns
[05:10:34] <Cork> i think jquery-ui has a poc with a select column element, but i might remember wrong
[05:13:44] <miCSu> Hmm, odd.. I made a method for links that does the ajax call and appends the child elements after the clicked link. Works fine on link click event but when I tried to create an "open all" link that has each for all the linktypes calling $(this).myMethod(); it doesn't do anything
[05:14:17] <top> Cork: I can't make deep custom  for it.
[05:14:49] <miCSu> child elements are the elements gotten as "data" from success: function(data) { ... }
[05:16:03] <Cork> ?p @ miCSu
[05:16:04] <bot-t> miCSu, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:23:26] <AdamPDotty> you created the function as method of jQuery object?
[05:23:47] <JillesCode> Hey guys, I'd like to recreate something like this with jQuery and CSS3 ( http://www.2dstudio.nl/ ) are there any existing libaries that can help me with this?
[05:25:36] <clocKwize> JillesCode, its mainly css, the primary circles have higher opacity and have some code wobbling them around, thats about it
[05:25:52] <clocKwize> you should try jquery.floatingbubbles.js
[05:26:56] <clocKwize> it does it at mutliple levels too I just noticed, but still, its the same thing - just some calculation to make it float around a point a bit, applied to each bubble
[05:27:02] <clocKwize> there will not be a library fo that
[05:27:07] <JillesCode> clocKwize: yeah I know, it's not that hard, but there are these floating bubbles behind, moving in a random pattern (not sure if it's random) how would I do that?
[05:27:23] <clocKwize> look at the existing code
[05:27:28] <clocKwize> oh i see, flash
[05:28:27] <clocKwize> they are all actually circling small circles around a point, each one starting at a different point of the circle
[05:31:59] <Cork> alternatively you could use svg, that would be fairly easy to do there; but then you get the ie problem though
[05:33:52] <Palanivel> Hi friends......i need one help
[05:34:30] <Palanivel> replace(/[^0-9\.]/g,''); am using this thing to avoid except number's
[05:34:50] <Palanivel> but i want to allow -,+
[05:35:00] <Palanivel> simple thing but am not get...........
[05:35:06] <Palanivel> Please let me know
[05:36:24] <Cork> Palanivel: replace(/[^0-9+\-\.]/g, '')
[05:37:09] <Cork> if you only want to allow + and - at the beginning you would have to to two replace calls
[05:40:47] <UltraMC_2> How to center buttons in dialog?
[05:42:35] <badbandit> hey there, is something lke this a) possible b) bad idea? My goal was to create a generic ajax call which is private but that I can use to trigger it's success for listeners to pick up or grab returned data through the return {} statement... http://dpaste.com/814695/
[05:43:02] <badbandit> I wasn't sure if having the prototype definitions inside the object definition is not  correct/bad practice
[05:44:34] <letweet> json is hard :( my dad isn't coming through... it doesn't even look like the GET was a success even
[05:44:55] <Palanivel> @cork only one user able to enter -
[05:45:01] <Palanivel> that how to restrict
[05:45:37] <Cork> Palanivel: can you rephrase that?
[05:46:28] <Palanivel> rephrase  means enpty the field values
[05:46:38] <Palanivel> @ cork rephrase  means enpty the field values
[05:46:47] <LSshock> Hi all, is there a way to get the index of the current div (.wrap) if this is inside a parent div with many more divs of the same class? (and i have a couple more of the same parent type, this is why i need to know the index of the div only in the main div it is in)
[05:47:59] <Cork> LSshock: your looking for .index() ?
[05:48:16] <LSshock> i looked at that but then i would search for all .wrap and give me the index based on the total?
[05:48:16] <Cork> Palanivel: sorry i don't follow what you mean
[05:48:23] <LSshock> *it
[05:48:56] <Cork> LSshock: index returns the elements index in its parent
[05:49:14] <Cork> or rather dom order matching the selector
[05:49:30] <Lucky--> letweet: your dad or data?
[05:49:39] <Lucky--> is he a deadbeat?
[05:49:40] <Cork> LOL
[05:49:47] <Cork> i totally though he meant dad XD
[05:49:52] <Palanivel> @cork......allow to user to enter -,+ with number only
[05:49:53] <Lucky--> LOL
[05:50:04] <Lucky--> thats doubly funny
[05:50:12] <Lucky--> one for him messing up, and you for assuming
[05:50:20] <Palanivel> @cork......for that only am used that replace concept
[05:50:35] <Cork> ?_?
[05:50:56] <Cork> ok, if anyone can make out what thats meant to mean please help Palanivel
[05:51:13] <Guest23611> ?wat
[05:51:14] <letweet> lol Lucky-- well spotted... my data even
[05:51:46] <letweet> not sure what my dad has to do with json though...
[05:52:25] <LSshock> Cork: ah, it worked fine, i was thinking it would find all of the specified div/with classname. Anyway thanks :) (boo on me for not trying first)
[05:54:38] <letweet> "Wow, never manually build JSON by using string concatenations, you're never gonna make it right." ... he may be right
[05:59:53] <Cork> letweet: theres librarys in almost every language out there for generating json strings
[06:00:09] <docmur> Is there an alarm or timer function in jQuery?
[06:00:10] <Cork> letweet: no need to reinvent the wheel
[06:00:26] <Cork> ?g mdn setTimeout @ docmur
[06:00:37] <Cork> >_>
[06:00:50] <Cork> bot-t is dead again -_-'
[06:01:09] <Cork> docmur: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.setTimeout
[06:01:12] <flameo_> its my BIRTHDAY
[06:01:27] <AdamPDotty> you inviting us to a party?
[06:02:16] <docmur> This is an asyncronis method?  I'm basically trying to poll a server every 2 second well the rest of web page is repsonsive
[06:02:33] <Cork> docmur: yes timers are async
[06:02:46] <Cork> else it would freez the page
[06:02:49] <flameo_> AdamPDotty - get away you stranger Just Kidding ofc your invited XD
[06:02:57] <docmur> well you never know, hence why I'm asking
[06:03:08] <seutje> but what if a response takes longer than 2 seconds? :o
[06:03:41] <docmur> it shouldn't it's just posts to small script that polls a mysql table
[06:04:15] <Cork> docmur: btw you prob don't want to pull every 2 second
[06:04:39] <docmur> well the time is unimportant
[06:04:43] <Cork> that generates a lot of load
[06:04:45] <docmur> 2, 5, 10 etc...
[06:04:46] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/mhBYq/ - you can press a button and a form will appear. But, if I have multiple forms, how do I prevent it from opening all of them?
[06:05:06] <Cork> docmur: i would say everything below 20 sec is really risky
[06:05:48] <docmur> 20 seconds is extreme long for a polling situation
[06:06:01] <docmur> is there some kind of interrupt or signal catch
[06:06:17] <Cork> abletony84: by not using inline javascript actions, and byt referencing relative to the button you clicked
[06:06:24] <Cork> byt==by
[06:06:56] <Cork> docmur: the reason i said to be careful is not based on the time, its based on the load from doing the ajax call
[06:07:01] <abletony84> those inline ones I think are from reCAPTCHA - disregard those please
[06:07:31] <Cork> docmur: as each pull will generate a full connect - request - read data - close connection cycle
[06:07:36] <AdamPDotty> so its a question of selectors
[06:07:52] <abletony84> referencing relative? hmmm
[06:07:58] <docmur> Well then and this is a little off topic for the room, is there a better client side language to use
[06:08:14] <Cork> AdamPDotty: if so, then where is newPosting called from?
[06:08:38] <Cork> ah your self execting it
[06:09:25] <clown> identify P3PP1F00
[06:09:37] <clown> whoopsi
[06:10:14] <Cork> AdamPDotty: form.eq($(this).index()).slideDown();
[06:10:48] <Cork> AdamPDotty: and that could could prob be simplified quite a bit
[06:11:14] <abletony84> Cork: that is great man =)
[06:11:14] <letweet> Cork: this is my first time working with json and http handlers... http://mondaybynoon.com/wp-content/uploads/xVyoSl.jpg
[06:11:38] <abletony84> Cork: *that* can be simplified? really? i was under the impression that it was the ultimate..
[06:12:43] <Cork> AdamPDotty: http://jsfiddle.net/mhBYq/2/
[06:12:55] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[06:12:57] <Cork> abletony84: ^
[06:13:19] * AdamPDotty fiddles
[06:13:25] <abletony84> hehe
[06:13:27] <Cork> ble, selector error
[06:13:38] <letweet> Cork, in any case, the data is now coming through... just gotta get it showing up on the page :D
[06:13:45] <Cork> abletony84: http://jsfiddle.net/mhBYq/4/
[06:15:03] <abletony84> Cork: great---but it doesnt seem to hide them by default though
[06:15:19] <Cork> ah, you want to hide the forms?
[06:15:22] <abletony84> i was working on http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/mhBYq/3/ but it only seems to wanna open the top form
[06:15:33] <abletony84> by default yeah they should be hidden :-)
[06:15:47] <Cork> abletony84: http://jsfiddle.net/mhBYq/5/
[06:16:50] <Cork> and.. fixing the slidedown case error http://jsfiddle.net/mhBYq/6/
[06:17:06] <JillesCode> Anyone knows how I can get a 'bump' effect in jQuery? I use animate() now, {height: '+=20'} but that just makes it bigger, I'd like to get such an effect as in http://www.2dstudio.nl/
[06:17:22] <abletony84> hehe.. *nailed it*
[06:17:30] <abletony84> thanks a lot..
[06:17:34] <Cork> np
[06:17:46] <Cork> JillesCode: check into easing
[06:19:49] <Cork> JillesCode: if the ones built into jquery isn't enough check http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/
[06:20:18] <UltraMC_2> Why when my dialog box is modal:true any animation of other elements are skipped? When I turn modal:false other elements animate good - why?
[06:21:53] <kossak> hi everyone
[06:22:51] <kossak> i have a problem with jquery.autocomplete, to be specific, with options like 'select', 'focus', etc
[06:22:53] <Cork> UltraMC_2: your sure?
[06:23:08] <noregret> i got this html which is cloned in var clone  http://jsfiddle.net/cgX37/ how can i loop it all the replcae the numbers (1 to 10) to e.g (11 to 20)
[06:23:10] <UltraMC_2> Cork yeah, tested, wanna see it live?
[06:23:17] <kossak> script does not respond on any of those, no error, no nothing
[06:23:19] <Cork> sure
[06:24:09] <Cork> noregret: you want to work with it as html or as dom?
[06:24:43] <noregret> Cork: i just want to replace the number, then append() it somehere else...
[06:24:47] <Cork> and what do you want to replace it with?
[06:25:13] <kossak> code here: http://justpaste.it/1f9k
[06:25:17] <kossak> any idea?
[06:25:21] <noregret> there are 10 nummbers here (from 1 to 10) i want them replaced byt the next 10 numbers (11 to 20)
[06:26:08] <UltraMC_2> Cork, live: http://www.multiplayerminecraft.pl/jquery/ , if I change modal: true to false  in http://www.multiplayerminecraft.pl/jquery/js/funkcje.js fadeOut() for .DODAJ will not fire
[06:26:08] <seutje> noregret: http://jsfiddle.net/cgX37/1/
[06:27:39] <noregret> seutje: should i add $(clone).find('a')... at the begning ? being it a clone..
[06:28:12] <seutje> suppose, wherever your reference lives
[06:29:43] <christo_m> i want to append an li (with a bunch of html in it) to the same ul right after said li.. so i tried something like $('ul#itemList').append($('li.itemRow')); and it isnt working
[06:29:45] <christo_m> no errors or anything.
[06:29:54] <christo_m> looked at the source, nothing added to the dom
[06:30:09] <christo_m> according to the docs you're able to select an element before appending it, so im not sure why this doesnnt work.. any ideas?
[06:30:40] <Cork> noregret: http://jsfiddle.net/cgX37/7/
[06:31:08] <Chris_CC> Hi guys, I;m trying to toggle the visibility of something as well as the colour of the button in jquery, however i cannot use toggleclass to change the text color because i;m using the class to differentiate the button press (I have lots of buttons on the page) how do i go about toggling the color from grey to white?
[06:31:09] <norm> i'm writing a plugin with coffeescript, following the guides from jquery.org. i'm having trouble figuring out where to put "helper" functions, that is, functions that are called by other functions
[06:31:15] <norm> for example, secondary() in http://pastie.org/5073117
[06:31:30] <Chris_CC> my pastebin http://pastebin.com/78UWH28K
[06:31:40] <seutje> kossak: don't u have to supply the options object as a single parameter
[06:31:47] <christo_m> Chris_CC: You can write a custom toggle listener, to do both the class switching and color switching (via .css or something)
[06:31:58] <eip56> Morning n3rds
[06:32:16] <Chris_CC> christo_m: I;m fairly new to all of this could you explain or what should i google to look into that more?
[06:32:34] <Cork> UltraMC_2: wheres the animation?
[06:32:57] <black_warlock> Eviltwin there?
[06:33:00] <black_warlock> hi all
[06:33:05] <UltraMC_2> Cork I got the problem - If animation is running and I move mouse over modal - animation is terminated (and it can be stopped or finished)
[06:33:29] <UltraMC_2> I think its becaouse JS is line by line, is there option to trigger animation in idependend "thread" ?
[06:33:43] <christo_m> Chris_CC: ya just look at .toggle
[06:33:56] <Cork> UltraMC_2: js isn't line by line, but it is single threaded
[06:34:05] <christo_m> Chris_CC: save the states as booleans or something and toggle based on that
[06:34:05] <alcuadrado> is there a non-minified version of jquer ui for download?
[06:34:14] <UltraMC_2> Cork, any multithreading option for animations?
[06:34:17] <Cork> UltraMC_2: it executes one function loop at a time
[06:34:18] <Chris_CC> christo_m: thanks will lread into that more
[06:34:36] <Cork> UltraMC_2: the dialog can't land in a loop, that would hang the browser
[06:34:48] <Cork> (unresponsive script)
[06:35:07] <seutje> kossak: yeah, I get "Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on autocomplete prior to initialization; attempted to call method '/form/multiagencyautocomplete'"
[06:35:11] <UltraMC_2> Cork, I dont want to run it in a loop, I want to make my animations (fadeIn/Out) idependent
[06:35:17] <Cork> alcuadrado: check the developer tab
[06:35:25] <seutje> kossak: try specifying it in the options object as "source"
[06:35:26] <UltraMC_2> .stop(true,true) ?
[06:35:32] <Cork> alcuadrado: or cdn.googleapi.com
[06:36:00] <kossak> seutje, but autocomplete itself works fine, gets proper data from proper source, puts it in proper place
[06:36:30] <Cork> UltraMC_2: if something does a lot of stuff in a loop, nothing will update on the page until thats finnished (removed elements won't be visibly removed from the page)
[06:36:34] <alcuadrado> I have just found that, thanks Cork :D
[06:36:40] <Cork> UltraMC_2: thats how rendering works, its not just js
[06:36:59] <kossak> what bothers me is no reaction on using select
[06:37:40] <seutje> kossak: what version of autocomplete are you using?
[06:38:04] <seutje> s/autocomplete/jquery ui
[06:38:34] <kossak> oh gosh, jquery.autocomplete 1.1, that might be it
[06:38:38] <seutje> cause this shit errors out for me: http://jsfiddle.net/9WyhT/
[06:39:49] <kossak> but i'm using also jquery-ui-1.9.0
[06:39:59] <seutje> wait what?
[06:40:20] <Cork> kossak: your using the old autocomplete plugin?
[06:40:20] <seutje> so u have jquery.autocomplete.js and jquery ui autocomplete mixed & matched?
[06:40:31] <kossak> not realy sure which one is actualy used to autocompleting ;) (i inherited project)
[06:40:40] <seutje> I see
[06:40:47] <seutje> well, try to stick to one :P
[06:40:52] <kossak> will do ;)
[06:40:59] <alcuadrado> does anyone use jqueryui with require.js? how do you require it?
[06:41:02] <seutje> it greatly improves debugging times :P
[06:41:12] <Cork> and the syntx for the plugin is quite different from the ui built in one
[06:41:16] <Cork> *syntax

[06:42:44] <seutje> alcuadrado: http://www.requirejs.org/jqueryui-amd/example/webapp/scripts/main.js
[06:43:39] <UltraMC_2> cool!
[06:45:11] <alcuadrado> seutje, thanks. that's a jqueryui version preprocessed with jburke's script, right? I wanted to know if anyone managed to use it without that script, as it can be done with shims now.
[06:47:03] <seutje> alcuadrado: well, jquery UI doesn't define itself as a module, it just fucks with jquery a bit
[06:47:17] <seutje> this is the version he's requiring: http://www.requirejs.org/jqueryui-amd/example/webapp/scripts/jqueryui-1.8.13/jqueryui.js
[06:47:30] <seutje> only diff is the define wrapper
[06:49:02] <alcuadrado> yep, that's what I meant
[06:49:08] <alcuadrado> I'm currently using that
[06:49:17] <alcuadrado> but I'm updating to 1.9
[06:49:45] <alcuadrado> and as require 2.0's shims can solve that problem without having to modify the files, I'll give it a try
[06:55:20] <Chris_CC> Hi guys , i can;t seem to get .toggle to work for changing the color of a buttons text.  This is what i have http://pastebin.com/ZxdvWKsK  when clicking it, the function works, but the color does not change, then clicking again, the color changes to white, any clicks after, the button is still white
[07:01:30] <ink_> eze people
[07:01:56] <kossak> ok, now works great :) thanks, seutje!
[07:06:58] <computer2000> can anyone help me with modernizr, i need to load a js file only if modernizr passes a certain test, is this possible?
[07:08:08] <scar> so after my successful ajax request, i am using .fadeOut(), yet the object seems to just sit there and not do anything. http://pastebin.com/fYRR1S5C
[07:09:26] <Pessimism> I have a button that initiates a POST request. The button is a link with `href="#"`. The problem is that when I click it, the browser scrolls all the way to the top. I don't recall this happening all the time before. How do I prevent this on-click scrolling from happening?
[07:09:40] <Pessimism> Imagine a "Like" or "Follow" button for instance
[07:09:56] <seutje> computer2000: http://modernizr.com/docs/#load
[07:10:27] <Chris_CC> HELP ^^ .toggle is causing my button to disapear instead of swapping text colors .. any idea how to make the button text change color and the function to toggle hide t he content http://pastebin.com/DfjNBzCY
[07:10:29] <UltraMC_2> How to place cursor in input with jQuery?
[07:10:32] <computer2000> thats it seutje, thx man
[07:10:45] <dualcore> Pessimism: don't link to #, use something like href="javascript:void(0)"
[07:10:55] <seutje> lolwat?
[07:11:01] <seutje> dualcore: why?
[07:11:17] <Chris_CC> Im copying this for the color change http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/ .. but on my site it's hiding the content instead of changing hte color :( http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[07:11:35] <dualcore> i assume there is some other function handeling the click which is why the link is to #
[07:12:36] <seutje> Pessimism: use the event passed to the handler (first param)
[07:12:58] <seutje> Pessimism: like $('button').on('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[07:13:10] <seutje> that would prevent the default "click" action of all <button> elements
[07:13:22] <Pessimism> seutje: Interesting, thanks
[07:13:23] <seutje> (note that it will not capture the "submit" event on the form)
[07:13:48] <dualcore> ^^ listen to seutje
[07:14:28] <Pessimism> should I just go with href="#" as before?
[07:14:59] <Pessimism> e.g. `<a class="js" id="1" href="#">Like</a>`
[07:15:36] <dualcore> also since you're handling it with javascript it could just be a button or any element instead of <a>
[07:15:40] <AdamPDotty> why a href if you got no target?
[07:16:02] <seutje> Pessimism: my point is that the href shouldn't matter to your behavior
[07:16:08] <Pessimism> cool
[07:16:20] <seutje> if you prevent the default action, that is
[07:16:46] <AdamPDotty> just drop the href
[07:16:54] <seutje> ideally, your link should work without javascript, so the href should prolly be present and link to a page that handles the same stuff, but without javamascript
[07:17:09] <seutje> anchor elements without an href act differently
[07:17:17] <seutje> for instance, they aren't caught by a:link
[07:17:30] <AdamPDotty> makes sense
[07:17:42] <seutje> so some browsers won't apply the style you'd expect (by default)
[07:18:16] <seutje> Chris_CC: when passing functions to toggle, it behaves like binding a click handler
[07:18:33] <seutje> Chris_CC: so essentially, you're binding a click handler that binds a click handler when clicked
[07:18:51] <Chris_CC> seutje: i think i understand lol, how do i fix that :S
[07:18:53] <plushy> hello guys, could someone please help a complete newbee? I'm trying to understand preview function in this:http://www.webmotionuk.co.uk/php-jquery-image-upload-and-crop/. What does "$("#thumbnailÂ +Â divÂ >Â img")" means? I know it selects an element by name but how?
[07:20:16] <seutje> Chris_CC: http://pastebin.com/yZzsPXge is one way, I think
[07:20:19] <seutje> but could be optimized
[07:20:22] <seutje> hang on
[07:20:25] <Chris_CC> seutje: working example here http://www.carclubbed.com/alpha/  email = bmw_z3_1@email.com pass= passwordccalpha  click any of the filtersa t the top under the shout box (USERS/CLUBS/MEETs/EVENTS)
[07:21:00] <Chris_CC> seutje: thanks, i will try that for now :)
[07:21:32] <seutje> Chris_CC: it would be easier to work with classes than straight up css btw
[07:22:08] <Chris_CC> seutje: The only problem is that I;m using classes to isolate the differnt buttons on the page for jquery :(
[07:24:05] <seutje> Chris_CC: so?
[07:24:12] <seutje> http://pastebin.com/YV2hNsSK <- more optimized
[07:24:30] <seutje> just need a .make-me-white { color: white; } in your css
[07:24:42] <seutje> well, depending on the specificity of your stuff, of course
[07:25:08] <Chris_CC> seutje: would'nt changing the class make "button.filter'" redundant?
[07:25:34] <seutje> Chris_CC: it doesn't change the classes that are on there already, it'll only add/remove that one class
[07:25:54] <Chris_CC> seutje: like a class within a class? (sorry, i'm new lol)
[07:26:03] <seutje> elements can have multiple classes
[07:26:12] <Chris_CC> seutje: ahh i didn't know that, thanks :)
[07:26:19] <seutje> like <button class="foo pee poo bla">
[07:26:21] <Chris_CC> seutje: wish i knew that 6 months ago! lol
[07:26:27] <seutje> they can, however, only have 1 ID
[07:26:40] <seutje> an ID with spaces in it, is still considered a single ID
[07:26:41] * Chris_CC facepalm
[07:26:45] <seutje> (albeit a crummy one)
[07:26:57] <Chris_CC> this would of made my life 100x easier a few months back lol
[07:26:58] <scar> is there a way to trigger on page view ? for example, if i am viewing a site and i either change tabs, open a new window/tab, or even an instant message pops up over it (so i can still see the website in background)-- HOWEVER, when that window is 'refocused', so to speak, how can i trigger that?
[07:27:17] <Chris_CC> yet another thing to optimise later i guess ^^
[07:27:24] <scar> sorry for my jumbled stream of consciousness
[07:28:35] <seutje> scar: I suppose you'd have to set a flag on window blur and then check that flag on window focus
[07:28:49] <seutje> or go cowboy and only check on window foxus
[07:28:51] <seutje> focus*
[07:29:17] <scar> seutje: 'or go cowboy'? lol. also, what do you mean set a flag?
[07:29:26] <scar> seutje: just set a var
[07:29:32] <seutje> yeah
[07:29:36] <scar> seutje: ahh so window blur is when the window is out of focus, duh haha
[07:29:38] <seutje> some sort of thing you can check later
[07:29:45] <seutje> scar: afaik, yeah
[07:29:56] <scar> interesting. and you meant go cowboy as ...? its bad for just on window focus?
[07:30:23] <seutje> well, I'm not sure if that fires when the page loads up as well
[07:30:39] <seutje> also, I can imagine there to be serious restrictions on what you can do on window blur
[07:30:52] <scar> seutje: why?
[07:31:07] <seutje> like, I can imagine that $(window).on('blur', function() { $(window).focus(); }); doesn't work
[07:31:17] <seutje> as that would lock the user on your page, sorta kinda
[07:31:32] <scar> seutje: basically just to check the shopping cart total at top right (in case of session timeout) and on shopping cart page
[07:31:52] <scar> is there a way to disable an entire div, including every child/grandchild/offspring ?
[07:32:13] <seutje> you can prolly do that, but don't be surprised when some browsers don't allow certain things on that event
[07:32:33] <seutje> disable? as in .attr('disabled', true) ?
[07:33:11] <scar> yeah i figured that might be a browser thing
[07:33:20] <scar> i use .attr('disabled', 'disabled')
[07:33:25] <scar> for inputs, etc
[07:33:27] <ink__> sup people
[07:34:31] <dualcore> scar: maybe you could use .hover() instead of focus.  seutje would that work?
[07:36:31] <seutje> dualcore: blind ppl don't hover
[07:36:37] <seutje> mobile users only hover by accident
[07:37:02] <dualcore> indeed
[07:53:32] <docmur> if #chat is my parent div and inside that is #messageWindow a child div and inside that div is a textarea #textBox, how do I append into textBox?
[07:53:53] <ink_> $('#textbox').append(foo)
[07:53:56] <ink_> ;)
[07:54:20] <ink_> oh sorry, i'm being thick
[07:54:31] <ink_> got distracted by all the talk of divs
[07:55:20] <ink_> var current = $('#textbox').val()
[07:55:32] <ink_> $('#textbox').val(current + 'foo')
[07:55:36] <docmur> Don't I have to select it as $('#chat > #messageWindow > #textBox') or something to get the 2nd level child
[07:55:39] <ink_> nope
[07:56:20] <ink_> you can if you want
[07:56:42] <ink_> but since its an ID, there should only be one in the DOM anyway
[07:57:16] <firstclassfunc> can anyone explain to me why it makes sense for this to return "one" instead of ALL of the HTML inside?: $('<div id="div1">one</div> <div id="div2">two</div>').html()
[07:59:16] <dualcore> firstclassfunc: that is not how you select elements.  var alldata = $('#div1').html() + $('#div2').html()
[07:59:18] <ink_> firstclassfunc: because $(...) will return an element
[07:59:33] <mg983`> Hi guys. I am trying to get rid of the revert animation (N.B. I want to keep the revert action, just want to remove the animation of it reverting) when you drop from the left side to the right side in this example : http://jsfiddle.net/2fsVZ/
[07:59:41] <ink_> not a document
[08:01:05] <firstclassfunc> dualcore, ink_: I have to provide a wrapper around the divs to get the desired functionality.. it just seems silly
[08:01:24] <ink_> iirc
[08:01:40] <ink_> you MIGHT be able to do
[08:01:53] <ink_> $(...)[0] to return the first div, and $(...)[1] for the second
[08:02:05] <ink_> try doing
[08:02:46] <xec_> firstclassfunc: may i ask what you're *really* trying to do? .html() returns a html string, which seems to be what you already have?
[08:02:51] <RawProduce> I have a page which, on load, makes a bunch of AJAX requests syncronously
[08:02:55] <ink_> $(...).each(function(i) { console.log(i); });
[08:03:01] <ink_> see what u get out, i suspect it'll be an idex
[08:03:08] <RawProduce> in chrome, the page does not render until all of the JS is executed but on firefox it does
[08:03:12] <ink_> index*. this is some weird shit happened to me yesterday
[08:03:16] <RawProduce> how should I handle this?
[08:03:31] <ink_> show a loading overlay
[08:03:51] <xec_> ?sync @ RawProduce
[08:03:51] <bot-t> RawProduce, NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the userâ€™s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[08:04:11] <hlve> lol
[08:04:12] <firstclassfunc> xec_: I have a single file with a bunch of divs (not inside html or body tags) that I use for templating. I couldn't get it to work until I put them all in one big div
[08:04:34] <RawProduce> uhh, so what if I have some AJAX requests that need to be synchonous?
[08:04:43] <firstclassfunc> when I wanted to access #div4 it would always return the first div in the page (#div1)
[08:04:43] <RawProduce> am I expected to manually manage synchonisation issues?
[08:04:50] <xec_> RawProduce: they don't. did you read what bot-t just told you? :)
[08:04:56] <RawProduce> and why doesn't jquery implement it properly?
[08:05:04] <xec_> holy mother of...
[08:05:13] <RawProduce> xec_: yes, and some cases require things to be done serially
[08:05:25] <xec_> RawProduce: like what, specifically
[08:05:45] <RawProduce> like calling webservices which fire off data importers
[08:05:50] <RawProduce> order is of paramount importance there
[08:06:27] <xec_> RawProduce: what difference does that make? have the server return what it wants - when it wants
[08:06:47] <RawProduce> xec_: because importing X has a dependency on Y already being imported
[08:06:48] <xec_> RawProduce: don't make the browser hang while the server is working
[08:07:11] <RawProduce> ok, so if I implement this in a web worker that will fix the problem, right?
[08:07:13] <xec_> RawProduce: then you can chain the requests
[08:07:24] <Trisox> doei!
[08:08:02] <RawProduce> xec_: thanks for the advice
[08:08:42] <dualcore> mg983`: http://jsfiddle.net/2fsVZ/1/
[08:11:00] <xec_> firstclassfunc: sorry, what? you're trying to find div#4 on the page?
[08:13:07] <firstclassfunc> xec_: I'm grabbing html from templates.html, a file which consists of a few divs (#div1, #div2, ...). I was trying to use jQuery to query the html and find e.g. #div4
[08:14:01] <firstclassfunc> for it to work, I have to put all of the divs inside of a div to be able to successfully query elements
[08:16:20] <xec_> a root element would make sense, yes. If all the divs are siblings you could use .filter() to find what you want though
[08:16:59] <sunbeam> is it necessary to use a cite="" with <blockquote> ?
[08:17:00] <sunbeam> I've got a large quote, but dont know the source
[08:17:01] <firstclassfunc> oh I see
[08:17:10] <sunbeam> a quote and the author
[08:18:24] <xec_> sunbeam: cite is not required, no
[08:18:29] <dualcore> firstclassfunc: if #div4 is a unique id(as it should be) then you should be able to select it normally $('#div4')
[08:19:07] <sunbeam> xec_: so what  can i best use
[08:19:21] <sunbeam> <blockquote>Text tex text <span class="author">Author</span></blockquote> ?
[08:19:39] <firstclassfunc> dualcore: try it, I doubt it'll work for you
[08:19:55] <xec_> sunbeam: http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/single-page.html#the-blockquote-element
[08:20:11] <xec_> sunbeam: copypasted; "Attribution for the quotation, if any, must be placed outside the blockquote element"
[08:20:18] <seutje> sunbeam: cite is an optional attribute
[08:20:39] <seutje> ?g html5doctor blockquote cite
[08:20:41] <bot-t> seutje, Quoting and citing with <blockquote>, <q>, <cite ... - HTML5 Doctor - http://html5doctor.com/blockquote-q-cite/
[08:21:16] <dualcore> firstclassfunc: http://jsfiddle.net/zY9j5/1/
[08:21:29] <sunbeam> ok
[08:21:34] <sunbeam> so
[08:21:40] <sunbeam> i place the blockquote in a div
[08:22:04] <sunbeam> <div class="quote"><blockquote>Quote</blockquote><span class="author">Author</span></div>
[08:22:07] <sunbeam> right?
[08:23:20] <firstclassfunc> dualcore: one second
[08:25:05] <scar> how can i fail an ajax request in the beforeSend parameter?
[08:25:18] <xec_> sunbeam: if you really need a containers, sure, why not. div and span are both semantically meaningless though
[08:26:25] <firstclassfunc> dualcore: your example assumes the html template is in the document, when in fact it's not. it's just stored in a string
[08:26:36] <deepak> new here......................
[08:27:15] <dualcore> firstclassfunc: how are you loading the template data?
[08:27:34] <xec_> deepak: welcome :) i see you found the "." key on your keyboard.
[08:28:05] <sunbeam> xec_: ok, but what should i else use?
[08:28:05] <NoiseEee> firstclassfunc: why does it seem silly? you have an array of <div>s, not a single div.  you can't call html on an array of <div>s
[08:29:01] <xec_> sunbeam: the example in the spec is just using a simple <p> for the attribution, but mentions that <small> is often used too (especially in cases where the attribution is included for legal reasons)
[08:29:12] <firstclassfunc> dualcore: http://jsfiddle.net/J5wX3/1/ complete this
[08:29:28] <deepak> "test&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   " => How we can remove &nbsp; from the string...... using javascript
[08:29:44] <fALSO> replace?
[08:29:54] <deepak> not workinh
[08:30:20] <deepak> i have tested replce method of js
[08:31:08] <fALSO> use it again
[08:31:09] <fALSO> it works
[08:31:34] <dualcore> firstclassfunc: http://jsfiddle.net/J5wX3/3/
[08:31:38] <xec_> ?eval "test&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ".replace(/&nbsp;/g,"")
[08:31:42] <bot-t> xec_: "test "
[08:31:48] <xec_> deepak ^
[08:32:23] <dleonardi> hi! :) so.. AMD is all the talk right? and one of its objectives is to be "cross toolkit". Can anybody name me some module/widget/whatever that actually works across toolkits? ie, its using components via requirejs or something that exist in all toolkits?
[08:32:32] <dleonardi> something that works across zepto/jquery, dojo, prototype, younameit ?
[08:32:35] <xec_> dualcore, firstclassfunc -- i'm winning! http://jsfiddle.net/J5wX3/2/
[08:32:52] <firstclassfunc> dualcore: eh, still not desired. Don't add anything to the page until you have #div2
[08:33:19] <xec_> you said div1 ;D
[08:33:44] <xec_> firstclassfunc: if you want the other, http://jsfiddle.net/J5wX3/4/
[08:33:45] <firstclassfunc> xec_: well it doesn't matter, as long as you can grab div1 or div2
[08:34:24] <xec_> firstclassfunc: .html() when called on a collection, will return the html contents of the *first* item - so it does matter ;)
[08:34:31] <firstclassfunc> xec_: thanks. If I remember correctly dualcore said he could do it one way, but it doesnt work afaik
[08:34:45] <firstclassfunc> xec_: well yes
[08:35:03] <firstclassfunc> <dualcore> firstclassfunc: if #div4 is a unique id(as it should be) then you should be able to select it normally $('#div4')
[08:36:05] <xec_> yeah i see. he assumed you had it in the DOM already i guess. anyway, i'm off - good luck
[08:36:13] <firstclassfunc> alright later, thanks
[08:36:47] <anew> an xhr request with only a ? .... for example mysite.com/ajax/?
[08:36:53] <anew> why is there nothing after the query string
[08:40:48] <dualcore> firstclassfunc: you could load the data to the dom but have it all hidden at first?
[08:41:15] <firstclassfunc> dualcore: yeah, but there really isn't a need for that
[08:41:23] <firstclassfunc> filter does work
[08:43:00] <anew>  type: q == "post" ? "Post" : "Private Get" anyone seen this type of ajax request before?
[08:43:04] <anew> "private get" wtf is that
[08:43:15] <black_warlock> hi people
[08:43:16] <xckpd7> bye
[08:43:27] <black_warlock> how do i reloade jqstate ?
[08:43:35] <hlve> what?
[08:43:36] <hlve> lol
[08:43:54] <xckpd7> can anyone explain to me the point of pubsub? I'm looking at this video right now: http://vimeo.com/16234207
[08:44:25] <xckpd7> and I can't really create a distinction between pubsub, and just calling functions modularly
[08:44:27] <lathan> anew: the types are GET, POST, HEAD (PUT ?)
[08:44:46] <anew> yeah weird, wonder why there is 'private get' in there
[08:44:52] <lathan> bug
[08:44:59] <lathan> the http protocol doesn't have that
[08:45:15] <anew> wonder what the last dev was thinking
[08:45:18] <lathan> or wierd browser hack
[08:45:57] <lathan> probably bug
[08:46:13] <anew> lathan have u ever seen a query string that doesn't exist? i'm looking at this and it goes to url mysite.com/ajax/id/?
[08:46:16] <anew> just a questoin mark?
[08:46:29] <lathan> anew: yah
[08:46:49] <anew> what are they trying to do there? how are they sending the data then ?
[08:46:49] <lathan> there's nothing wrong with it
[08:46:53] <lathan> they aren't
[08:46:56] <lathan> they are sending no data
[08:47:21] <anew> wtf
[08:47:21] <UltraMC_2> Can I unfocus an inputbox?
[08:47:22] <black_warlock> I have a page with a drag and drop but i wish to reload the document.ready function to apply some rules
[08:47:26] <anew> they are checking for usernames
[08:47:27] <lathan> they probably just add it to the string then concatentate som serialized data...and the data was empty
[08:47:29] <anew> they must be sending them somehow ?
[08:47:34] <black_warlock> after each drop
[08:47:49] <lathan> url + '?'+ $(form).serialize() #where form has no elements
[08:48:01] <lathan> anew, and its a GET?
[08:48:09] <anew> POST
[08:48:19] <lathan> anew if its a POST then they could send the actual POSTDATA
[08:48:28] <K^> help someone? http://jsbin.com/ejopon/1/edit  Im trying to find anchor from content after ajax request. Still showing undefined, why?   (Look to HTML section, no output ..)
[08:48:30] <lathan> data for a post doesn't get put in the query_string
[08:48:42] <hugo_moss> anybody recommend a good book for jquery?
[08:49:07] <anew> ok for some reason i thought all ajax requests had to go thru query strings
[08:49:10] <lathan> anew: the point of POST is that you send data *not* in the Qstring, so you aren't limited by the length of the Qstring
[08:49:12] <lathan> nope
[08:49:25] <lathan> ajax requests follow the same protocols as regular requests
[08:49:31] <UltraMC_2> why this is not unsetting my focus: $("#DIALOG1").blur(); ?
[08:49:50] <lathan> the only difference is how the browser starts/stops them..(and the user agend usally says something about xhtml request)
[08:50:27] <lathan> UltraMC_2, your question is equivalent to "why doesn't my car work?"

[08:50:40] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[08:50:50] <lathan> UltraMC_2, sorry...jsfiddle an example please ^^
[08:50:54] <anew> lathan ok general security question, get is sent in query strings and post is sent in the variable and we can't see it, where does it reside on the way from client to server ?
[08:51:17] <lathan> anew, where are you looking to "see it"
[08:51:27] <lathan> I can see post data in the browser console
[08:51:28] <Heather_> question: does an event assign to an element if the element is .hide();  on page load?
[08:51:40] <anew> i mean is it encrypted somehow
[08:51:45] <lathan> anew, no
[08:52:02] <anew> i can retrieve it with $_POST... but other then that is there any way to grab it
[08:52:08] <NoiseEee> Heather_: no, events as far as JS goes are user initiated
[08:52:09] <lathan> anew, if the request is https, the whole transaction will be encrypted but the webserver will decrypt it before it gets to you
[08:52:11] <anew> (if i was a 3rd party trying to see it)
[08:52:29] <lathan> anew, are you asking about a man-in-the-middle attack?
[08:52:33] <anew> ya
[08:52:37] <K^> help someone? http://jsbin.com/ejopon/1/edit  Im trying to find anchor from content after ajax request. Still showing undefined, why?   (Look to HTML section, no output ..)
[08:52:40] <lathan> POST is no more secure than GET
[08:52:48] <lathan> for that
[08:52:56] <anew> hmmm rly i thought it was more secure
[08:53:00] <anew> btw how are u seeing post in console ?
[08:53:07] <lathan> POST just means there are no special characters, no limits on length...it allows uploads...
[08:53:17] <lathan> anew, which browser? (plz say Chrome or FF)
[08:53:20] <anew> i c... thought it was secure way to send data
[08:53:27] <dualcore> anew: you need an ssl cert and then use https:// then it will be encrypted
[08:53:27] <anew> yeah obv chrome XD
[08:53:28] <lathan> anew, nope
[08:53:41] <lathan> anew, F12, then the Network tab
[08:53:49] <ink_> hah, think i've solved it :)
[08:54:05] <ink_> i knew doing fuck all for two days and idling in #jquery would do it
[08:54:20] <anew> ok need to find some site that sends post data then now
[08:54:31] <ink_> i didn't read above
[08:54:39] <ink_> but hurt.it and httpbin.org
[08:54:40] <lathan> anew: the Network tabs shows all network requests...and if you click on the reqest it will let you see headers, request data..response...cookies.....time it took
[08:54:46] <ink_> might be what you're after
[08:54:50] <ink_> hurl.it*
[08:54:51] <ink_> sry :p
[08:54:57] <anew> ya i see 'post' in there
[08:55:04] <anew> so it's in the header
[08:55:10] <lathan> yep
[08:55:19] <anew> crazy for some reason i thought post was more secure
[08:55:22] <anew> wtf
[08:55:24] <lathan> nope
[08:55:45] <ink_> speaking of .it domains, i bagged rupt.it the other day. cor.rup.it, dis.rup.it, inter.rupt.it
[08:55:48] <lathan> man in the middle is dangerous because you have to know you are talking to the server you trust
[08:55:52] <anew> lathan but i can't see the actual username i typed in that is sent as post data
[08:55:57] <ink_> there's nothing sad about me still being excited about that :p
[08:56:01] <anew> i.e. in get requests it's right there in the query string
[08:56:03] <lathan> anew, example page?
[08:56:07] <anew> in this post tab under header i dont see it
[08:56:08] <hugo_moss> anybody know any other book series similar to head first?
[08:56:44] <anew> let me get one
[08:56:45] <anew> one sec
[08:57:02] <anew> or if u have one also
[08:57:23] <lathan> anew I want to see what you are saying doesn't show up
[08:57:25] <lathan> I know it shows up
[08:57:49] <jeffsmykil> IE 7 background-position bug, experience with work arounds?
[08:58:19] <TheBrayn> is not supporting IE 7 a valid work around?

[09:00:12] <black_warlock> how can i reload a function after update ?
[09:00:17] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/cRPap/15/
[09:00:59] <Heather_> NoiseEee so an element that is hidden on page load need to be assigned a new event in combination with e.g show();
[09:01:17] <shoky> K^  doing $('a', data) is the same as:  $(data).find('a')  which looks for _descendants_ of the root node
[09:01:33] <shoky> K^ but in your case the root node IS the <a>
[09:01:43] <NoiseEee> Heather_: I'm not following. what are you trying to do/
[09:02:12] <shoky> K^ oh sorry , is the text also part of the html
[09:02:24] <K^> yes
[09:02:39] <K^> return content is HTML with some text and one link (google...)
[09:03:05] <K^>  K^  doing $('a', data) is the same as:  $(data).find('a')     I know thats the same
[09:03:34] <shoky> K^  try  $('<div>').append(data).find('a')
[09:03:46] <K^> its will work i know
[09:03:50] <black_warlock> zzzzz
[09:04:14] <K^> but .. why does not work in console? (firebug console or chrome native console?)
[09:04:26] <K^> understand behavior
[09:04:33] <shoky> K^ you are hard to understand
[09:04:45] <K^> im sorry
[09:04:45] <K^> :)
[09:04:48] <shoky> "does not work"
[09:04:54] <shoky> what are we supposed to do with that
[09:05:17] <black_warlock> why the script doesnt update the view after drag and drop ? http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/cRPap/17/
[09:05:25] <K^> show links in console without appending to HTML or something
[09:05:38] <K^> I want to find links in ajax request
[09:05:41] <shoky> K^ console.log( $('<div>').append(data).find('a').attr('href') )
[09:05:57] <K^> without appending
[09:06:05] <K^> only in request
[09:06:15] <shoky> it's appending to a div in memory..
[09:06:20] <shoky> not to the page's DOM
[09:06:31] <K^> its not working because its not dom only string?  (data from callback)
[09:06:40] <shoky> what's not working :\

[09:08:04] <UltraMC_2> How to include instructions if success: $.post(url,{el: wartosc_inputa},function(data) {} ?
[09:08:12] <shoky> but you have  text + <a> node
[09:08:21] <shoky> which is not a proper "root node"
[09:08:40] <shoky> (even if you just had the <a>  it would be the root node, not a descendant of the root node)

[09:08:47] <K^> im idiot
[09:08:52] <K^> searching in some STRING

[09:09:10] <K^> thx - my stupid basic mistake

[09:11:40] <ryanneufeld> UltraMC_2: see ?ajax

[09:12:32] <anew> so what'sthe point of post data if u can see it all in the header
[09:12:56] <shoky> to send data?
[09:13:27] <anew> yeah but if u can see get and post just the same
[09:13:38] <anew> who rly cares if u send get or not
[09:13:47] <shoky> get is very limited in what you can send
[09:13:54] <shoky> get is for getting
[09:13:57] <shoky> post is for posting
[09:14:11] <anew> can u see form data in headers also?
[09:14:19] <shoky> you can see anything you want
[09:14:29] <nullx> you use GET you want the user to be able to copy the link IMO, otherwise it's always POST
[09:14:32] <anew> so if u dont have ssl and someone signs up, ur pwd is transmitted
[09:14:35] <anew> out in the open
[09:14:39] <nullx> yeah
[09:14:42] <nullx> &password=abc123
[09:14:43] <anew> wow
[09:14:43] <shoky> sure..
[09:14:50] <nullx> it's still out in the open in POST though lol
[09:14:59] <anew> that's what i mean is it out in the open in post
[09:15:05] <anew> u can view it in the header
[09:15:07] <nullx> well it is
[09:15:13] <nullx> but it's not as obvious
[09:15:17] <shoky> as you've been told, POST is not more secure than GET, not at all
[09:15:21] <nullx> yea
[09:18:03] <tlkr> nullx, shoky the get parameters are "normally" logged within server logs, depending on configuration and will also be stored in browser history if enabled. However as far as the actual transmition goes they are sent in the same header packet.
[09:18:18] <shoky> ?
[09:18:36] <shoky> what does logging/history have to do with it
[09:19:30] <tlkr> We are talking about information security no?>
[09:20:04] <shoky> sure..
[09:21:28] <shoky> you're talking about logging & history though, which have nothing to do with a third-party sniffing your http session while in progress. and also that is dependant on browser/server settings which can be changed
[09:23:10] <anew> so inside network tab, headers, the post data is below the tab 'form data'
[09:23:15] <shoky> or maybe your point was the second thing you said, in which case, disregard me
[09:23:39] <shoky> anew: it's in the headers, yes
[09:24:53] <tlkr> if we are talking specifically about sniffing packets then my point is irrelevant.
[09:25:01] <anew> any way to tell in the headers what the name of the post data is...what they named their variables
[09:25:12] <shoky> variables?
[09:25:27] <shoky> you can see all the post data that was sent
[09:25:49] <shoky> key=value  pairs, assuming you're using the default content-type
[09:25:56] <anew> i mean if it is a very long form submit... each field has an id...
[09:26:07] <shoky> sure.. it should all be there
[09:26:47] <anew> very interesting
[09:26:50] <anew> cool to play with
[09:38:05] <anew> http://pastebin.com/MM3qyX9t so how can i get this data via $_POST ?  I can get $_POST['ui] and $_POST['t
[09:38:13] <anew> but not the c[]
[09:39:11] <nullx> c[0]?
[09:39:13] <nullx> c[2]?
[09:39:17] <nullx> er there is no 2
[09:39:19] <nullx> 0,1,2
[09:39:23] <nullx> there is a 2

[09:39:25] <WebDragon|away> fault weight
[09:39:44] <anew> i tried those
[09:39:51] <nullx> you know, there's 2 types of people 1) people who start at index 1, and 1) people who start at index 0
[09:39:55] <anew> c[0] didn't work
[09:39:56] <WebDragon|away> is there a way to detect with jquery whether the font-face loaded for josefin sans, and so set the weight to the semibold for the base font>
[09:40:07] <anew> neither the other c[1] or c[2]
[09:40:10] <anew> so i'm lost
[09:40:40] <WebDragon|away> oops,  @import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Josefin+Sans:600,700,600italic,700italic);
[09:40:48] <anew> shoky u there
[09:41:05] <WebDragon|away> there was an extra 'K' in there somehow (didn't delete all the other declarations before pasting it)
[09:41:21] <Cork> anew: arrays start at zerom but what is that data in your pastebin?
[09:41:27] <Cork> *zero,
[09:41:46] <anew> cork it's from the header
[09:41:48] <anew> form data
[09:42:10] <anew> i can retrieve $_POST['ui'] and $_POST['t
[09:42:13] <Cork> cause thats not valid for any format i know
[09:42:26] <anew> but the c[] i cannot get user, usernameavailable or ['jon']
[09:42:45] <esiegel> For $.ajax(), the documentation says that POST and GET are fine, but PUT and DELETE are not supported on all browsers. Which browsers are at risk?
[09:42:47] <anew> c%5B%5D:%22User%22%2C%22usernameAvailable%22%2C%5B%22jon%22%5D
[09:42:50] <Cork> anew: can you get the raw data instead of that?
[09:42:52] <anew> here is the variable uncoded
[09:42:52] <Cork> ah perfect
[09:43:24] <Cork> wtf...
[09:43:33] <Cork> anew: is that meant to be a param string?
[09:43:40] <Cork> or what?
[09:43:55] <anew> hmmm yes
[09:43:59] <Cork> its not valid
[09:44:12] <Cork> thats just a text blob
[09:44:27] <anew> this is what's sent via ajax
[09:44:28] <anew> in the header
[09:44:57] <Cork> c[]=User&c[]=usernameAvailable&c[][]=jon is what it should look like
[09:45:13] <Cork> else its not a valid param string
[09:45:35] <anew> bleh must be some way for me to retrive this in post
[09:45:57] <Cork> you would have to grab it as a raw string
[09:46:05] <anew> so according to what you wrote... to get jon i would write $_POST['c[0]c[0]']
[09:46:05] <anew> ??
[09:46:11] <Cork> no
[09:46:19] <Cork> you can't reference it in _POST
[09:46:23] <Cork> cause its not a param string
[09:46:38] <Cork> its almost json
[09:46:41] <Cork> but not really
[09:46:58] <anew> so why can i get the others (ui and t) but not this ?
[09:47:04] <Cork> anew how are you generating this in jquery?
[09:47:36] <Cork> new ui, is cause its the first section to is manage to parse that
[09:47:49] <Cork> if you manage to get anything efter that, i donno how thats possible
[09:48:08] <anew> yes i can get 't' also
[09:48:15] <Cork> wheres that located?
[09:48:58] <anew> what do u mean
[09:49:09] <Cork> doesn't matter
[09:49:37] <Cork> but the original question is, how are you generating this in jquery?
[09:49:39] <anew> how the hell is it sending an array of post data
[09:49:46] <anew> can i pm u
[09:49:59] <Cork> ok
[09:55:58] <shoky> esiegel i think practically all browsers in use today support it.. maybe safari 2 didn't or something
[09:56:47] <esiegel> shoky: thanks!
[09:57:15] <Cork> no DELETE and PUT is fine in every browser that exist more or less period
[09:58:08] <Cork> it's been in common use for almost 10 years now
[10:00:56] <mllie> is it possible to run a script on form submit and verify that the script is completed before actually submitting the form?
[10:01:08] <Cork> no
[10:01:14] <Cork> well, depends
[10:01:37] <Cork> if the script is synchronous your reparteed that it is
[10:01:50] <Cork> but if its async (ex. uses ajax or a timer) then no you can't
[10:02:06] <Cork> its even guaranteed that it won't be
[10:04:13] <mllie> Cork: oh, really?
[10:04:15] <esiegel> millie, sure you can
[10:04:30] <mllie> esiegel: how?
[10:04:40] <esiegel> You can use .done() I believe.
[10:04:45] <Cork> no
[10:05:09] <Aamir> why the first div is not animating? http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/Pygfn/4/  :}
[10:05:16] <Cork> the submission will happen when the event handler ends
[10:05:27] <esiegel> Wait, Millie, what exactly are you trying to do.
[10:05:31] <Cork> everything that has a delayed execution (async) will happen after that
[10:05:32] <esiegel> What is the script?
[10:05:47] <Cork> its just how js works
[10:06:19] <Tavp> hey guys, I have a DropDownList, but when I click to select an Item, it never selects the one that I clicked. No matter where I put a Dropdownlist on my page, it does not work the why it normaly does. Might it be something abou the select="selected"???
[10:06:24] <esiegel> If the script is submitting the form, then submitting the form is one of the things the script needs to do before it is finished, and therefore can't really happen after the script finished.
[10:06:30] <esiegel> If that made any sense.
[10:07:21] <esiegel> If the script does something else to the form before submitting, then you can submit the form through javascript instead of through a "submit" button, and run the scripts in order.
[10:07:25] <Cork> Aamir: your using a global variable
[10:07:33] <mllie> esiegel: actually I want to track a login attempt, by including a js-file when submitting the login-form. The login-form sends the post data to another site, so it cannot be tracked over there
[10:07:37] <Cork> Aamir: so your animating the second element twice
[10:07:52] <Aamir> Cork: how to fix it? :|
[10:08:03] <Cork> Aamir: define your variable
[10:08:08] <Cork> var $this = $(this);
[10:08:16] <Aamir> Cork:  how
[10:08:21] <Aamir> update the fiddle :P
[10:08:22] <Cork> var $this = $(this); <--

[10:09:11] <Aamir> Cork: thanks
[10:09:32] <Cork> Aamir: "use strict"; ftw!
[10:09:45] <esiegel> millie, So you want the first thing (js-file include) before the login is sent to the other site?

The issue is that I am trying to click on the Stop in the Name of Love image so a caption appears (slideDown) and when the user clicks on the caption slideUp is fired.

[10:19:38] <Aamir> the second call overwrite methods.el
[10:22:07] <saba> I'm doing two AJAX requests triggered from two different events. The first (A) creates a new id and returns that to the client, the second (B) deletes that id. However sometimes B is called before A is ready. In this case I'll call .abort() on the A request. The problem here is that even if the XHR request state of A is 1 the id will be created on the server, causing B to skip it's request (since the A request was aborted).
[10:22:19] <saba> Any ideas on stabilising this, still aborting the A request?
[10:24:06] <saba> That is A called -> B called, aborting A in state 1. Everybody *should* be happy, however A was still successful on the server side (the operation of creating the id is really fast, as well is the server).
[10:25:24] <saba> My current solution is to use a AJAX context on A and instead of aborting A I'll put a class on the context of A. When A is completed (where it should have been aborted) it will delete it's newly created id.
[10:25:51] <david_souther> saba sounds like you have a race condition that will need a rearchitecturing of your approach.
[10:25:59] <saba> that is A called -> B called, putting class -> A complete -> A aborting itself
[10:26:00] <david_souther> Why do you depend on the server to generate your id?
[10:26:45] <Gho5t> Anyone aware of a plugin from Chrome that is similar to Firefox's FireFinder, which allows you to see what jQuery events are attached to elements?
[10:27:21] <saba> david_souther: only the server can do it
[10:28:05] <saba> however aborting in state 1 should be a common practice not causing race conditions. My solution with A aborting itself works however I'm interested in how people solves this generally
[10:31:08] <karolyi> Gho5t: web developer plugin? it's a builtin
[10:31:25] <Gho5t> no
[10:31:35] <Gho5t> I'm not talking about Firebug
[10:31:38] <Gho5t> FirefFinder
[10:33:44] <anew> shoky u there ?
[10:33:54] <eddiemonge> saba: what are you trying to do exactly?
[10:33:58] <Eviltwin> Well you could always poke at $._data(element, "events")
[10:34:26] <eddiemonge> Gho5t: you can inspect the dom element and there is a accordion in the elements tab with bound events
[10:35:02] <karolyi> Gho5t: you can look at event listeners in the chrome web developer
[10:35:15] <eddiemonge> Gho5t: check out http://www.netmagazine.com/features/33-fantastic-chrome-extensions
[10:35:47] <eddiemonge> tip 16
[10:37:06] <Gho5t> ah thanks
[10:37:34] <Gho5t> you can't click on the function and be taken to the code in the actual script file though?
[10:38:30] <saba> eddiemonge: I was pretty exact. A creates an id, B deletes it, sometimes B wants to interrupt A's process before it's done. That doesn't work with abort, not even in XHR state 1. My solution is to have A deleting itself *after* it's done.
[10:38:58] <anew> http://pastebin.com/MM3qyX9t can anyone help me get the _POST data of c[] here i tried everything
[10:39:34] <eddiemonge> saba: i know but you arent providing a test case and im worried that you are trying to solve problem x with solution y instead of solution x
[10:39:47] <eddiemonge> anew: what is that?
[10:40:11] <shaft0> I'm having some weird behaviour when trying to get the contents of an iframe.  If I say "var frame_content = $('#frame_id').contents();" I get "undefined", but if I type "$('#frame_id').contents()" into the console, it brings up the proper DOM.  Any ideas?
[10:40:11] <anew> it's form data inside the header
[10:40:27] <anew> it sends this post info to server
[10:40:32] <anew> but i can't get the contents of c[]
[10:41:32] <saba> eddiemonge: it's more a matter of understanding the difference between state 1 and state 2.
[10:41:54] <eddiemonge> anew: probably not the best place as this is a jquery channel. how are you sending the data and what on your server are you using to get it?
[10:42:28] <eddiemonge> saba: now you are throwing question z into the mix lol. thats what im asking, what is it you want exactly? twitter style (140 characters or less)
[10:42:37] <anew> yes it sends this info via ajax
[10:43:24] <eddiemonge> saba: http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#states
[10:44:23] <eddiemonge> anew: not to be a jerk but you arent answering my requests for more info. can you please make a jsfiddle of the code sending the ajax request and possibly the code on your server you are using to try to get the data (and what language)?
[10:44:35] <anew> eddiemonge can i pm u
[10:44:43] <Cork> eddiemonge: ya, he didn't for me either
[10:44:56] <Cork> thats when i dropped it
[10:44:58] <eddiemonge> anew: why cant you put it here?
[10:45:34] <saba> eddiemonge: yes, that is the five states. It is interesting thought that the server might have processed the entire request while the XHR state is 1, thus my problem
[10:45:41] <anew> just to show u what i'm lookig at
[10:46:01] <eddiemonge> saba: sounds like you are trying to create race conditions or are having them.
[10:46:19] <eddiemonge> anew: i can read a link here easier than if it was in a pm
[10:46:40] <eddiemonge> and someone else might be able to help as well if its here. there are many excellent developers in this channel trying to be helpful
[10:47:00] <nullx> nope, just shitty ones that are trying to be
[10:47:18] <saba> eddiemonge: I'm sorry we're not getting anywhere, but I have a race condition and a stable solution for it. However because of the XHR state's relativity I'm curious how people who have had these race conditions handle them, generally speaking
[10:47:22] <nullx> misreadd/sarcasm fail
[10:47:55] <anew> eddiemonge i can retrieve $_POST['ui'] and $_POST['t]... but c[] i cannot retrive, so that is what i'm stuck on
[10:48:00] <saba> I'm not looking to solve my problem or anything, I'm only looking for other people's experience
[10:48:04] <eddiemonge> saba: promises
[10:48:21] <saba> eddiemonge: that is a good one I haven't thought of, thanks
[10:48:36] <eddiemonge> saba: check in the promise for the existence of the other and act accordingly if still waiting for it
[10:48:39] <nullx> anew: wait, did you go $_POST['c[0]'] or $_POST['c'][0]?
[10:48:51] <Noor_egy> hi Everyone

[10:49:06] <eddiemonge> lol sorry saba not for you

[10:49:33] <nullx> also
[10:49:36] <nullx> $_POST is php
[10:49:38] <anew> nullx first one yes, let me try the second one
[10:49:39] <nullx> not javascript or jquery
[10:49:50] <eddiemonge> anew: PLEASE paste your ajax javascript code into jsfiddle and provide us a link
[10:50:03] <anew> well ajax sends post back to the server
[10:50:04] <nullx> totally incorrect
[10:51:28] <anew> wu
[10:51:29] <anew> wut
[10:51:35] <anew> how does jquery send requests to server then
[10:51:53] <anew> why inside my ajax i have to write type 'post' or type 'get' then
[10:51:57] <anew> *scratches head*
[10:52:16] <anew> secondn one didnt work either
[10:52:17] <nullx> erm, does that work in jquery?
[10:52:21] <nullx> $_POST is PHP afaik
[10:52:27] <nullx> I don't know about retrieving this stuff in jQuery
[10:52:28] <nullx> but
[10:52:33] <nullx> it would not be the 'c[0]'
[10:52:49] <anew> what i mean, in the header i'm sending a post and a get request
[10:52:52] <anew> those are the only options here
[10:53:10] <nullx> hm
[10:54:34] <eddiemonge> anew: just do print_r($_POST);exit; and see whats in there. if you can get it from there, you will need to ask in the ##php channel
[10:54:40] <NoiseEee> anew: perhaps http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-str.php is of use to you?  if not, thus ends the help *until you paste your ajax javascript code into jsfiddle and provide us a link*
[10:55:56] <lathan> ?hi
[10:55:57] <bot-t> lathan, :)
[10:56:57] <Absolute0> Is it possible to get the individual scaleX scaleY and rotate values of an elements transform property?
[10:57:13] <Absolute0> When I set it with jquery i use the format: this.find('img').css('transform', 'scaleX(' + xFlip + ') scaleY(' + yFlip + ') rotate(' + rotation + 'deg)');
[10:57:21] <Absolute0> But when I get it back, it's in a different format.
[10:58:08] <lathan> Absolute0, I'm not sure about the transform property, but often there is a shorthand version of the value and the long form
[10:58:35] <eddiemonge> Absolute0: that looks like you are trying to set it, not get it
[10:58:40] <Absolute0> it uses some sort of matrix conversion
[10:58:58] <lathan> Absolute0, have you looked at the specs for the transform property? http://w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transform.asp
[10:59:20] <lathan> Absolute0, what value is it giving you back?
[11:03:05] <Absolute0> http://jsfiddle.net/UMWTU/1/
[11:03:43] <thinkerweb> how do you deal with <select multiple="multiple"></select> ?
[11:04:07] <Absolute0> thinkerweb: you need to give more details.
[11:04:57] <Already> thinkerweb i'd add options to it!
[11:05:18] <NoiseEee> verrrrrry carefully
[11:07:35] <BillCriswell> Already: Why in the world would you want to do that?
[11:09:00] <BillCriswell> thinkerweb: What do you want to do with the data?
[11:09:31] <Absolute0> So as shown in my jsfiddle, I put in value, but get back a different format. I need to convert the matrix to my original format.
[11:10:37] <black_warlock> im boiling dam

[11:14:39] <thinkerweb> BillCriswell, thx
[11:14:40] <Absolute0> that's not it..

[11:15:28] <eddiemonge> Absolute0: http://api.jquery.com/get/
[11:15:33] <Kcko^CZ> .get(0) // makes  object to pure js object
[11:15:38] <Absolute0> and it doesn;t work in firefox
[11:15:45] <Kcko^CZ> its same like $("p")[0]
[11:15:51] <Absolute0> ah
[11:16:03] <Kcko^CZ> and u can use native js method
[11:17:12] <eddiemonge> Absolute0: reason it doesnt work is that transform is still in draft. its a prefixed property and isnt consistent everywhere
[11:17:20] <eddiemonge> Absolute0: http://caniuse.com/#search=transform
[11:18:35] <Absolute0> css('transform', '...') does work in firefox, your code doesnt
[11:19:46] <Absolute0> the last console is what i needed
[11:19:46] <Absolute0> thanks
[11:27:30] <jita> How can i do this if (event === this.children(.inner-text))
[11:27:39] <Wefs> Does anyone know if it's possible to dynamically add in data at a specific location in a table using a templating library like mustachejs?  I know this is the wrong channel for this but there's no where else
[11:29:11] <omts> i am using the new jquery-ui 1.9.0 tooltip widget, is there any way to make them timeout even if the associated element still has focus ?
[11:29:55] <black_warlock> Eviltwin there ?
[11:31:11] <black_warlock> omts add delay(5000).fadeOut('fast')
[11:32:00] <Eviltwin> I understand about 15% of the messages you send
[11:32:17] <black_warlock> Evilllllllllllllllll !
[11:32:22] <Eviltwin> My ability to help you depends on my ability to understand you
[11:32:49] <black_warlock> impossible to explain with just a question this prob
[11:33:50] <black_warlock> shall i pvt pls ?
[11:36:16] <black_warlock> omts ????
[11:36:18] <omts> black_warlock: thanks a lot! when trying to figure out where to add your suggestion i realized that there is an open event, that should do the trick
[11:36:32] <KWhat_Work> jquery ui widget namespace rules specified anywhere?  Is there a reason i cant use a top level namespace? (ex: $.widget('mynamespace', { )
[11:36:56] <black_warlock> yes
[11:37:04] <black_warlock> should be ui.item
[11:38:12] <KWhat_Work> black_warlock: yes it should be, but why ;)
[11:38:32] <black_warlock> because the ui has its own naming
[11:38:58] <black_warlock> you enter specific functions of a plugin
[11:39:35] <black_warlock> plugins are just complete functions that work on jquery
[11:39:57] <Eviltwin> http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide22
[11:40:04] <black_warlock> and you know to call specific functions also normally you can call .mytittiesfunction()
[11:40:58] <black_warlock> Evilllllllllllllllllllllllllll
[11:41:01] <black_warlock> zzzzzzz
[11:42:05] <jita> How can i do this if (event === this.children(.inner-text)) {}
[11:42:21] <jita> event.target
[11:43:09] <Eviltwin> if ($(this).children(".inner-text").is(event.target)) {} ?
[11:43:17] <lathan> jita, what event method are you using?
[11:43:21] <black_warlock> Eviltwin http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/cRPap/49/
[11:43:22] <lathan> jita, on? live? bind?
[11:43:27] <thinkerweb> how do you deal with <select multiple="multiple"></select> ?
[11:43:27] <jita> lathan, on
[11:43:46] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: Okay...
[11:43:47] <NoiseEee> thinkerweb: what does that question mean?
[11:43:47] <black_warlock> why when i move items the popup drop 4 times sometimes
[11:44:03] <black_warlock> are you familiar with sortable ?
[11:44:08] <thinkerweb> NoiseEee, how do you work with multiple select options
[11:44:28] <Eviltwin> I don't work with any of jQuery UI often
[11:45:07] <thinkerweb> I mean if it is just one select option, you can simple do $("selects-id") and you have your value, but what if you have multiple values
[11:45:21] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: $(function(){'reload'}); ?
[11:45:34] <black_warlock> yes but doesnt work lol
[11:45:41] <lathan> jita, what I am verifying is that if you use on, it should fill "this" as event.target
[11:45:47] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: What on earth do you think that does?
[11:45:49] <black_warlock> i would to reload the content of document.ready function
[11:45:57] <black_warlock> because when i move items
[11:46:16] <black_warlock> i d like the + appear near the items that have sub ul
[11:46:27] <eddiemonge> reload the content of document.ready function?
[11:46:29] <black_warlock> but well doesnt work
[11:46:36] <lathan> jita, yes: if you use on, then this will always be the target of the event
[11:46:46] <Eviltwin> Here: http://jsfiddle.net/cRPap/50/
[11:46:55] <Eviltwin> That's what you were trying to do
[11:47:07] <jita> lathan, i want to check this against DOM element like if (event.target === this) || (event.target === $('.inner-text', this)) { event.stopPropagation }
[11:47:10] <Eviltwin> But this one actually calls reload()
[11:47:12] <black_warlock> yes almost
[11:47:34] <lathan> jita, are you reusing this?
[11:47:59] <jita> lathan, not in the execution block no
[11:48:01] <black_warlock> anyway are effects i can remove them
[11:48:04] <lathan> jit$('...').on('event_type','selector...',function(){ var target = this; .....})
[11:48:08] <lathan> jita, and you should use .is
[11:48:39] <garciawebdev> hey jita, you should check if (event.target === this) || ($(event.target) === $('.inner-text', this))
[11:48:40] <lathan> if( $(this).is($('.inner-text', context)) )
[11:48:44] <black_warlock> but the fact when i move items the popup pop 4 times i dont understand it if i select just 1 <li> to move it
[11:49:11] <lathan> jita, do you have a demo? because event.target should always === this unless you are doing something else that resets this

[11:54:25] <lathan> jita, ^
[11:54:34] <lathan> thinkerweb, it won't work
[11:54:35] <jax> do we have a library to make a hierarchical checkboxed list? so when you select the parent item, the child items are selected, etc.
[11:54:42] <jita> lathan, this is what i want http://dpaste.org/Sx9CG/
[11:55:37] <lathan> jax, I don't know...try this: http://www.jqwidgets.com/jquery-tree-with-checkboxes/
[11:55:54] <jita> lathan, i want to stop propagating the event only if the event's targets are either self or its child node '.nav-innertext'
[11:56:09] <lathan> jita, $('.nav').on('click','.nav-innertext', function(e){ e.stopPropagation() });
[11:56:23] <lathan> jita, the 2nd optional argument between the event and the function is a selector filter
[11:56:30] <lathan> so it will only run if it matches that selector

[11:58:07] <vacho> lathan: is it nasty?
[11:58:12] <vacho>  what's a cleaner way?
[11:58:35] <vacho> didn't work :(
[11:58:53] <lathan> vacho, not sure...its just messy
[11:58:58] <lathan> cluttered
[11:59:04] <lathan> alot of code crammed into one spot

[12:02:56] <vedic> I am using toggle which works in FF and IE but it doesn't work in Safari. How to fix it?
[12:03:25] <MarcGuay> IE8 + slideToggle(), the content displays and then has display:none reset on it.  Any ideas?
[12:03:47] <noregret> how can i delete all next()s untill i get one with .class to stop ?
[12:03:59] <firstclassfunc> anyone here use dojo? is it easy to customize pages created with dojo widgets?
[12:05:07] <noregret> .nextuntil(class).remove() ?
[12:05:45] <lathan> ?nextuntil
[12:05:46] <bot-t> .nextUntil([selector], [filter]): Get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object passed. http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[12:06:00] <lathan> noregret, that looks like it would work....
[12:06:22] <tbl_> Can anyone explain this line to me? I can't find any other example of this sort of selector in the docs. var w = $("li", $(this)).width();
[12:06:24] <lathan> noregret, well...it would need to be a full jQuery selector, so ".class" or "#id" .....
[12:06:50] <Eviltwin> tbl_: $("li", $(this)) is the same thing as $(this).find("li")
[12:06:55] <lathan> tbl_, that is getting the width of the first li that is a descendant of this
[12:07:07] <tbl_> Ahhhh, thanks very much!

[12:08:15] <xckpd7> anyone familiar with PubSub? are you not supposed to be able to subscribe to things outside of the function it's called in?
[12:08:35] <xckpd7> I just assumed pubsub was more of a global anywhere thing.... it matches what it advocates
[12:08:37] <Eviltwin> Uh....
[12:08:40] <lathan> vedic, it is more likely that your code has a error in IE (because IE likes making up extra erors) and the toggle isn't running, rather then the toggle having a bug
[12:09:01] <lathan> idk @ PubSub
[12:09:07] <lathan> I've never heard of it....
[12:09:14] <Eviltwin> Here's global pubsub in jQuery: https://gist.github.com/661855

[12:13:50] <docmur> when I enable draggable() sometimes on refresh my layout will be completely screwed and scattered.  Is there a way to stop that?
[12:14:23] <Eviltwin> Sounds like a race condition
[12:14:55] <docmur> The draggable() is set at the first thing in the JS file, I mean if I disable draggable there is no issue

[12:28:21] <csdco> I have a list of items that I attach tooltips to (using the qTip plugin) whenever they are loaded in the page. Sometimes this list disappears and a new list appears with its own set of tooltips. If I'm always adding tooltips and using $('.my-class').qtip(); to bind qTip to them, am I going to have performance issues? Even if I don't, should I be unbinding these items that are added, or is the handler automatically unbound when the ite
[12:28:21] <csdco> are deleted from the DOM?

[12:28:56] <Ulfr> Hello all, I'm making a test taking program. I've got the exam set up to load questions, but it's not waiting for the user to answer a question before it loops over again. The question isn't written over but I can't move past the first one
[12:29:15] <xckpd7> question: is there anyway to get around doing this stupidness? http://pastie.org/5074829
[12:29:20] <xckpd7> just 14 lines of code...
[12:29:37] <xckpd7> I keep having to, in every single one of my functions, doing var t = this
[12:29:52] <xckpd7> and then referencing t inside of anything that might reclaim the value of this
[12:30:20] <lathan> Ulfr, javascript has no sleep command.
[12:30:27] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: http://pastie.org/5074837
[12:30:30] <lathan> Ulfr, so you cannot simply loop through each question
[12:31:16] <lathan> Ulfr, what you need to do is show 1 question, and when they click next, save their answer and incriment a counter to tell you to look at the next question.
[12:31:27] <lathan> Ulfr, you need to use events

[12:38:33] <mouses> i am animating a div that contains an img and some info below the img.  <div id="under-platform"><img /> <div id="caption"></div></div>  ... i set the "under-platform" div's width to animate to the img's width&height when i click a link to go to next image. this works fine, but it will no longer hold the caption within the "under-platform" div's physical screen space... any suggestions?
[12:39:50] <mouses> initially when i load the first image, the outer div wraps around the caption too, but when i animate, it no longer wraps around (physically), although the nodes are still children

[12:48:49] <lathan> something like pnotify
[12:48:50] <EugenA> hi, is it possible to bind second event handler to an element is not yet loaded?
[12:49:05] <lathan> EugenA, you want a live event delgation using on
[12:49:23] <lathan> EugenA, you select a parent element then give it a selector of what the item will be
[12:49:50] <lathan> EugenA, $('#parent').on('click','#element_that_will_be_loaded',function(e){...this...});
[12:50:04] <EugenA> lathan: the problem is that my script is being loaded (and run) before another script. So, my live() is being overridden, i think
[12:50:08] <thinkerweb> lathan, nah, something smaller, just like by the mouse pointer, a pop up div that has some text and fades away
[12:50:23] <lathan> thinkerweb, a tooltip?
[12:50:32] <thinkerweb> lathan, yep
[12:50:35] <thinkerweb> exactly

[12:53:02] <EugenA> so, i'm trying to add second click event to a-tag. my script is running first. I'm using jquery 1.4 and I need to use live(). Is it possible?
[12:53:02] <lathan> Marchitos, save it, and send us the fiddle link
[12:53:18] <Marchitos> http://jsfiddle.net/Krbmk/
[12:53:37] <EugenA> there is another script running second, which defines also click event
[12:53:38] <lathan> EugenA, live has the same functionality as on
[12:54:00] <lathan> $.live('click','#new_element', function(){...})
[12:54:08] <lathan> live doesn't override other lives
[12:54:12] <lathan> (no events do that)
[12:54:45] <EugenA> lathan: yes, but if two scripts define click event on same element, what will happen?
[12:55:05] <lathan> EugenA, as long as you aren't going div.onclick = ... then you are fine
[12:55:12] <lathan> EugenA, 1 of them will be called first
[12:55:55] <EugenA> lathan: my problem is i always see only one action, if i click on my element
[12:56:04] <lathan> Marchitos, jsfiddle puts the html and body tags in for you autmatically...
[12:56:10] <EugenA> lathan: the action from _second_ script
[12:56:11] <lathan> and the css goines in the css pane on the top right
[12:56:20] <Marchitos> i was editing it:)
[12:56:27] <lathan> EugenA, does it return false? or stopPropogation?
[12:56:36] <lathan> Marchitos, okay...just give me the final link after you save
[12:57:05] <lathan> Marchitos, basically drop the html, head title, body tags
[12:57:15] <tubbo> lathan: actually on() does a bind() if the element exists, and live() if it doesn't.
[12:57:26] <tubbo> that way you aren't shitting up your RAM with a bunch of unnecessary live(0s
[12:57:29] <tubbo> live()s*
[12:57:36] <tubbo> IIRC
[12:57:39] <lathan> tubbo, even if you give it a selector?
[12:57:50] <Marchitos> http://jsfiddle.net/Krbmk/6/
[12:57:58] <Eviltwin> .on() does not check whether the element exists or not
[12:58:11] <Eviltwin> It does .bind() behavior for one syntax and .delegate() behavior for another
[12:58:14] <lathan> tubbo, if you don't give it a selector...then it does a bind
[12:58:16] <Eviltwin> But it's the syntax that decides which is used
[12:58:22] <lathan> Eviltwin++
[12:59:31] <docmur> If I recieve an array back from a post how can I parse the array and append it to a div
[12:59:38] <docmur> if I don't know the size of the array
[12:59:44] <NoiseEee> iterate through it?
[12:59:48] <lacrymology> http://jsfiddle.net/5Etfc/ but I don't know what's happenig. I got it live, but you need to add some stuff to the cart and proceed to checkout to see it, at www.kontactsports.com
[13:00:30] <lathan> Marchitos, this works: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/Krbmk/7/
[13:00:38] <EugenA> lathan: the second script returns false
[13:00:44] <lathan> you needed to set it from onLoad to no wrap (head)
[13:01:02] <lathan> EugenA, the second script is getting bound as the first handler, and when it returns false it stops the propogation
[13:01:08] <lathan> ...preventing the other function from running
[13:01:16] <lathan> EugenA, make it return true and they will both run
[13:01:43] <slackz> Having an .on / .off event handler problem. I have a jsFiddle with all the details there.. Any help? http://jsfiddle.net/fThMa/1/
[13:02:08] <EugenA> lathan: why the second script is getting bound as the first handler??
[13:02:16] <Eviltwin> Why are you using $("#" + elem.attr("id"))?
[13:02:20] <Eviltwin> Instead of just elem?
[13:02:31] <lathan> EugenA, something about how it saves the bound events
[13:03:07] <EugenA> lathan: maybe i can do something in my first script to avoide this problem?
[13:03:22] <EugenA> i don't want to modify other scripts
[13:04:10] <lathan> EugenA, if a later bound handler is killing the event propogation then there is nothing you can do
[13:04:16] <Marchitos> in my firefox the image appear without animation
[13:04:20] <lathan> except bind it closer to the exact element
[13:04:26] <lathan> Marchitos, it works in mine, what version of FF?
[13:04:47] <docmur> So text is an array coming back full of x index's and I want to append the html at each index to a div so how would I do that: http://pastebin.com/cmdHFAnV
[13:05:23] <Marchitos> 16 on win8
[13:05:41] <lathan> Marchitos, and you did my link: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/Krbmk/7/
[13:05:51] <spacebarbarian> is there a lightweight library for adding touch gestures to jquery core ?
[13:05:57] <Marchitos> yep
[13:06:01] <NoiseEee> docmur: append() instead of html()
[13:06:06] <lathan> it works on FF 16.0.1 on linux...
[13:07:02] <lathan> docmur, so #friendBar has plain text in it and you want to add a string at each index in the array text?
[13:07:23] <lathan> sounds like you'd need to do some substr work at each index
[13:07:31] <lathan> but what do you mean by index @ docmur
[13:07:32] <docmur> #friendBar is just an empty Div and text[x] has html code in it that I want to pick up and just drop in the friendBar
[13:07:48] <lathan> oh...okay...then append...like NoiseEee said
[13:07:52] <Marchitos> updating to 16.0.1 fix the problem. I am disappointed
[13:08:00] * hlve joins #FriendBar and realizes he's forever alone
[13:08:11] <lathan> Marchitos, FF is going through some interesting stuff with there versions....
[13:08:14] <lathan> a lot of rapid updates
[13:08:26] <lathan> so they must me discovering bugs and trying to fix them quickly
[13:08:27] <Marchitos> nope, it worked the first time
[13:08:33] <lathan> ?
[13:08:47] <Marchitos> now not anymore. I press run and the image appears without animation
[13:09:16] <docmur> right but what is storing the code at the index,  text is the array, I'm assuming index is 0, 1, 2 etcll but if I do .append(item) or .append(text.index) I get nothing
[13:09:27] <Keu> spacebarbarian: I've been pretty happy with hammer.js https://github.com/EightMedia/hammer.js
[13:09:40] <Marchitos> what happens if you press run? the animation restart?
[13:09:51] <lathan> Marchitos, FF is doing bad caching evil
[13:09:56] <lathan> do you have a jsfiddle account?
[13:10:02] <spacebarbarian> Keu, i was just looking at that one, also fouind this http://jgestures.codeplex.com/releases
[13:10:11] <lathan> (if so, login, run mine, and then go to jsfiddle.net/draft)
[13:13:58] <tubbo> lathan: maybe i'm mistaken, as i don't see it in the docs. but they imply that on() is now the recommended API for adding event listeners
[13:14:19] <tubbo> so i'm assuming that it figures out whether to bind() or live(), since the docs imply that you won't need to make that decision anymore
[13:14:21] <lathan> correct tubbo, on is recommended, because they joined both bind and delegate into one
[13:14:31] <tubbo> *really* glad they're gettng rid of bind() btw
[13:14:45] <someprimetime> tubbo: uhm it still uses bind internally
[13:14:52] <tubbo> darn ;)
[13:14:57] <tubbo> well i mean, at least i don't have to use it
[13:15:03] <lathan> no it doesn't
[13:15:06] <docmur> When I use that Each thing item is 'A' as in Array,  not the actualy value in the array at the index
[13:15:08] <lathan> it uses jQuery.Event.add
[13:15:10] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: .bind() uses .on() internally
[13:15:12] <jaha> Any idea why this https://gist.github.com/3907864 sometimes causes a slight flicker?
[13:15:13] <lathan> which is an itnernal thing
[13:15:14] <lathan> haha
[13:15:15] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: my mistake
[13:16:56] <lathan> docmur, is it actually a numerically indexed array, or an object?
[13:17:04] <lathan> (althought that shouldn't make a difference
[13:17:21] <lathan> docmur, console.log(text) and show us what it returns
[13:17:41] <docmur> It's a numeric array $div[0] = "div ......." , $div[1] = "div.........." okay I'll log it
[13:17:53] <lathan> docmur, if you are sure...then nvmind
[13:17:57] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ docmur
[13:17:57] <bot-t> docmur, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:18:15] <lathan> pastebin only goes soo far @ Eviltwin, docmur
[13:18:54] <docmur> I can't use jsfiddle because you can't see the php code which makes jsfiddle in this case not ideal, PHP is returned the array back to me,  However console.log returns Array
[13:18:55] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/DAuEG/ @ docmur and yes, please supply actual values/example at jsfiddle
[13:19:18] <tomasm-> hey, is there a copy of the jquery docs available for offline download? I have a low bandwidth quota on my web connection
[13:19:20] <lathan> docmur, then copy a small sample of the php output and put that in fiddle
[13:19:21] <NoiseEee> docmur: sounds like PHP is not doing what you want then docmur
[13:19:48] <lathan> tomasm-, http://docs.jquery.com/Alternative_Resources
[13:19:58] <tomasm-> lathan, those are all several years old
[13:20:06] <lathan> oh
[13:20:12] <tomasm-> jquery 1.3 vs 1.8
[13:20:15] <lathan> true
[13:20:42] <madprops> anybody knows of a jquery scrollbar plugin that resizes automatically?
[13:21:13] <madprops> or some way to hide the default scrollbar but keeping mousewheel enabled?
[13:21:20] <robgleeson> how can I access data-* attributes? I thought it was: $('selector').data['data-some-thing']
[13:21:27] <madprops> :]
[13:21:39] <NoiseEee> robgleeson: drop the 'data-'
[13:21:49] <NoiseEee> robgleeson: or use .attr('data-something')
[13:21:50] <robgleeson> NoiseEee: same problem. undefined.
[13:21:54] <docmur> I know this isn't PHP but this is what I'm echoing back to myself, I have it in the debugger: http://pastebin.com/ATXikmpW, I'll make the fiddle
[13:21:59] <robgleeson> attr works.
[13:22:04] <robgleeson> should have thought of that.
[13:22:05] <robgleeson> thanks.
[13:22:10] <NoiseEee> docmur: that is not valid JS
[13:22:22] <u89> robgleeson: also you should use parentheses
[13:22:42] <NoiseEee> ah yes what u89 said, robgleeson.   $(elem).data('thingy');
[13:22:53] <NoiseEee> but fwiw i find .attr() way handier
[13:23:01] <docmur> So javascript can't read the array basically?
[13:23:09] <NoiseEee> docmur: you're not sending back javascript, why would it be able to?
[13:23:20] <NoiseEee> docmur: in your php, json_encode($yourArray)
[13:23:21] <u89> $(elem) returns an object
[13:23:27] <lathan> tomasm-, I think this claims to have 1.7: http://www.jqapi.com/
[13:23:33] <mg983`> Hi guys. I am trying to get rid of the revert animation (N.B. I want to keep the revert action, just want to remove the animation of it reverting) when you drop from the left side to the right side in this example : http://jsfiddle.net/2fsVZ/
[13:23:36] <docmur> I assumed JS worked with arrays normally as in array[index]
[13:23:51] <invisib> How do I pass selector context to $.ajax like you can with $.load?
[13:23:54] <lathan> docmur, array[index] yes
[13:24:26] <invisib> For instance how do I do this with $.ajax:     $.load('google.com #searchbox')
[13:24:27] <lathan> invisib, in the success handler take the html $(html).contents('selector').appendTo()
[13:24:28] <tomasm-> lathan, thanks.... sucks though that it's still 9 months old
[13:24:29] <docmur> Thats what I'm returning I just have html code at the index which when I read array[0] should give me all that code
[13:24:40] <NoiseEee> docmur: please to learn js
[13:25:13] <lathan> tomasm-, sorry....you can try googling it and check out some of the javascript things to rip it off....some mention of a github / svn out somewhere..
[13:25:23] <invisib> lathan: Ah, thanks bro
[13:25:51] <lathan> ?src $.load
[13:25:51] <bot-t> (Result for '$.') Line#1133 - "// outside the $.when method. Cloning the object into a fresh array solves the issue" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#1133
[13:26:02] <lathan> invisib, see how jQuery does it ^^
[13:26:08] <lathan> oh ..no
[13:26:11] <lathan> ?source $.load
[13:26:12] <bot-t> (Result for '$.') Line#1133 - "// outside the $.when method. Cloning the object into a fresh array solves the issue" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#1133
[13:26:20] <lathan> ?source load
[13:26:20] <bot-t> Line#6835 - "load: function( url, params, callback ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#6835
[13:26:26] <lathan> there invisib ^^
[13:26:40] <lathan> oops...that source site is off
[13:26:53] <docmur> I'll just output it using json formating although that looks sloppy for this application on the php side
[13:27:06] <lathan> invisib, source for .load: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.fn.load
[13:27:11] <invisib> lathan: Yeah I looked at it but couldn't make sense of it :)
[13:27:50] <lathan> invisib, its in the .done section at the end
[13:27:53] <invisib> Seems silly to overwrite the function anyway just to make it available as $.ajax
[13:28:06] <Eviltwin> It's basically $.ajax({url: "google.com", success: function(data) { container.empty(); $(data).find("#searchbox").appendTo(container); });
[13:28:28] <lathan> invisib, overwrite?
[13:28:32] <invisib> Nevermind
[13:28:37] <lathan> jQuery.fn.load is still accesible
[13:28:41] <NoiseEee> docmur: understand that javascript only works with javascript. if you have PHP info you need to send to javascript, json_encode it so that JS can unpack it and get to the data.
[13:28:42] <lathan> just doesn't have all the options of ajax
[13:29:19] <lathan> docmur, that is the downside of jQuery.each being soo helpful. it saw it as a string and decided to split the string and give you each character
[13:29:46] <lathan> b-ot, was it you that was working on the current bot-t?
[13:31:06] <Gho5t> if you had a click handler on a button that 1 out of 10 times didn't fire in IE 9 alone, how would you go about figuring out what the issue is?
[13:33:01] <lathan> Gho5t, shoot IE9
[13:33:04] <lathan> lol
[13:33:09] <lathan> sorry
[13:33:10] <lathan> um,
[13:33:32] <lathan> Gho5t, is it the 1st time? last time? does it repeat every 10 times?
[13:33:52] <Gho5t> good question
[13:33:54] <Gho5t> seems to be random
[13:33:58] <Gho5t> let me see
[13:34:04] <lathan> Gho5t, I would make a jsfiddle and make a super simple example
[13:34:13] <lathan> then slowly add back the complexity to see what causes it
[13:34:19] <Gho5t> i wish
[13:34:28] <lathan> (assuming your simple example works properly)
[13:35:17] <lathan> Gho5t, I would replace the full binding with one that just notifies you (so you remove the chance of the code inside erroring out)
[13:35:33] <Gho5t> ok that's a good idea
[13:35:35] <Gho5t> trying that
[13:35:39] <ink_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8srcWfqYfDM
[13:35:51] <ink_> LTJ Bukem. Tune.
[13:35:53] <lathan> Gho5t, I'm sorry you have to work in IE
[13:35:54] <ink_> eze people
[13:35:58] <lathan> Gho5t, does IE have a console.log now?
[13:36:12] <Gho5t> yeah
[13:36:13] <tubbo> is there a way to reference attrs on the same element in a selector
[13:36:14] <tubbo> ?
[13:36:24] <tubbo> like say i have an input with value="1" and data-initial="1"
[13:36:26] <Gho5t> i bet they're really impressed with themselves
[13:36:28] <lathan> ?attribute-selector @ tubbo
[13:36:29] <bot-t> tubbo, Attribute Equals Selector [name="value"] - Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value exactly equal to a certain value. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[13:36:45] <tubbo> can i make a selector like $('input[value=data-initial]')?
[13:36:47] <ink_> Gho5t: im told the new IE is actually shit hot
[13:36:57] <tubbo> ink_: it's horribel
[13:36:59] <lathan> tubbo: and there are many more...matching...beginswith...endswith
[13:36:59] <ink_> dev features up the wazoo
[13:37:02] <NoiseEee> tubbo: no, you'd have to explicitly put '1' in both selectors
[13:37:05] <lathan> tubbo, yes, that should work
[13:37:07] <tubbo> darn
[13:37:07] <tubbo> :)
[13:37:09] <Gho5t> ink_: IE 10?
[13:37:26] <tubbo> lathan: it will work, but it will look for <input value="data-initial">, correct?
[13:37:31] <ink_> quite possibly, i'm doing mobile dev atm and i use linux
[13:37:35] <ink_> so im blissfully unaware
[13:37:44] <Gho5t> well in IE 9 they're not
[13:37:47] <ink_> 11 i thought actually
[13:37:50] * lathan nods @ tubbo
[13:37:51] <ink_> who knos
[13:37:58] <ink_> heh, sry to hear ;)
[13:38:01] <tubbo> ink_: IE 9 is awful :( just spent 3 days fixing a bug with my widget
[13:38:03] <lathan> yay ink_!
[13:38:05] <Gho5t> if they've made it so you can actually right-click inspect an element in IE 10, then they've made exponential improvements
[13:38:07] <Gho5t> fucking idiots
[13:38:13] <lathan> blissfully unaware of IE's isshues!
[13:38:17] <tubbo> IE 9's refresh button and refresh keycombo are different functions
[13:38:32] <lathan> tubbo, is one of them include pragma: nocache ?
[13:38:33] <lathan> *does
[13:38:50] <Gho5t> their caching is terrible too. have to hard refresh to see anything new
[13:39:00] <Gho5t> they try to cheat to seem faster
[13:39:16] <nullx> IE * is awful, the question is how awful
[13:39:18] <tubbo> Gho5t: yeah lol
[13:39:26] <nullx> higher the number, less awful
[13:39:33] <tubbo> Gho5t: *technically* so does Chrome
[13:39:35] <Szymon__> How to get all ID/classes from clicked element? $(this+" .TITLE").val(); ?
[13:39:49] <tubbo> and the worst part about Chrome is that you can't disable caching indefinitely, you have to keep doing it for every new inspector you open
[13:40:00] <bil2k> $('#divContainer').on('change', '.mySelectInput', myHandler) <---- can you even delegate a change event since a div doesn't really have a change event like a select input does??
[13:40:03] <Gho5t> tubbo: there's a noticeable difference the way IE does it. I can't really explain it, you just notice shit occassionally
[13:40:11] <tubbo> lathan: i've been given quite a strange problem...i need to basically check whether form fields have changed on #form_a when #form_b is submitted
[13:40:24] <tubbo> and if they have, show a confirm() dialog
[13:41:13] <lathan> tubbo, $('form').on('change','input, select, textarea', function(){ $(this).prop('changed',true) })
[13:41:20] <lathan> tubbo, or do a class instead
[13:41:26] <lathan> then check for thoses classes on submit
[13:41:49] <Gho5t> lathan: yeah so after about 5 refreshes my consoe.log() no longer works. I guess that's some progress in the right direction
[13:42:20] <mocramis_> hello. i'm not sure about wether or not my problem is a jquery one, but since my script seems to kill firebug debugger, i can anot sort this out.
[13:42:27] <lathan> Gho5t, not sure
[13:43:27] <mocramis_> this script : http://pastie.org/5075211 has the output :
[13:43:27] <mocramis_> true : version:16.0
[13:43:27] <mocramis_> undefined
[13:44:29] <mocramis_> this means, the body property is never changed though it the jquery request is executed.
[13:44:37] <mocramis_> does anyone has a clue about it ?
[13:46:49] <mouses> http://jsfiddle.net/K4eNN/1/   ==> i'm trying to get my platform background (the gray) to cover both the image and the caption below it. any help?
[13:47:18] <mouses> i am animating to the dimensions of the image, but i want it to also incorporate the caption below the image
[13:47:30] <mouses> hit the NEXT button to see what i mean
[13:48:47] <Krabbe_> Can you guys help me with a hint on how to achieve the following JSON request. I've mostly been looking around the jquery.ajax method and a bit on the FormData() object with no luck. All hints and thoughts are much appreciated now :) - what I need is: "the content type of the request must be multipart/form-data with one binary upload part named feedItemFileUpload parameter and one part holding the serialized input as either
[13:48:47] <Krabbe_> application/json or application/xml"
[13:50:29] <tomasm-> Krabbe_, is THAT for school?
[13:51:33] <Krabbe_> I wishâ€¦ I'm playing around with the Salesforce.com REST API trying to push filesâ€¦ this is from their docs
[13:51:38] <lathan> Krabbe_, is that describing the request or the response?
[13:51:47] <Krabbe_> describing the request
[13:53:10] <cpierce> anyone know a good scrolling news / scrolling marquee style horizontal ticker?
[13:53:35] <ziz> hey guys I have an icon that's placed in the center of a div, I want it to do a bounce effect when the div is hovered, any good plugins up there?
[13:53:37] <mouses> bro any help?
[13:54:11] <mouses> i want to animate to a height that incorporates the height of the caption below the image
[13:54:19] <ink_> i'm off to get play with some filthy vinyl
[13:54:30] <ink_> blend some tasty sounds
[13:54:41] <mouses> is my only choice to make a guess at the pixel height and say nextPhoto.height + 75?
[13:55:34] <xckpd7> question: http://pastie.org/5075317 <-- I want to use $.proxy, but is there anyway I can access the old meaning of this as well
[13:55:48] <tubbo> hey guys, how do you break out of jQuery.each?
[13:55:50] <xckpd7> if you look at the code, you see that I'm using App.blah but I want to be able to use this.blah
[13:55:51] <nchlssmith1> mouses: is there are reason you can't get the pixel height?
[13:56:18] <mouses> lol
[13:56:21] <mouses> damn
[13:56:21] <tubbo> break; doesn't work because each() is a function, not an inherent loop construct
[13:56:38] <mouses> you and your common sense making me look stupid
[13:56:41] <nchlssmith1> return;
[13:57:16] <nchlssmith1> I was there yesterday.  I almost made it to wtfdaily.com
[13:59:01] <ini> i'm stuck with what should be a basic scroll function, anyone have time to take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/QsCmu/
[14:00:37] <mouses> it works, thanks nchlssmith1
[14:00:40] <mouses> im a fucking idiot
[14:00:49] <mouses> i spent all that time building the sample on jsfiddle
[14:01:01] <mouses> fuckintg$.heigh()
[14:01:08] <mouses> fucking $.height()
[14:01:13] <mouses> simple as that
[14:01:26] <nchlssmith1> good solutions alway are simple.
[14:03:07] <ink_> ini: you looking to do smooth scrolling?
[14:03:26] <ink_> http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/ this looks very good
[14:03:32] <ini> ink_ - yes. but this code doesn't like the this.hash im sending
[14:03:40] <tubbo> is there a way to get an Array out of this? $('#account_main_form').find('input, textarea')
[14:03:48] <tubbo> typeof $('#account_main_form').find('input, textarea') is "object"..
[14:04:23] <ink_> ?makeArray
[14:04:25] <bot-t> jQuery.makeArray(obj): Convert an array-like object into a true JavaScript array. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.makeArray/
[14:04:28] <ziz> Anyone? How do I get a bounce effect on hover?
[14:04:37] <ini> ok cool, thanks ink_. I'll look at that if i can't figure out why this code doesn't work - i have it working in another page
[14:04:42] <NoiseEee> tubbo: var myStuff = $('#account_main_form').find('input, textarea');  console.log(myStuff);
[14:04:42] <ink_> might be what you'd wnt
[14:04:53] <NoiseEee> tubbo: surely you will see an array ;)
[14:05:28] <ink_> ini: sorry for pure lazyness, i'm live on the radio ;) give me a few mins and i'll check back in, gotta keep sorting the decks
[14:06:17] <ink_> if nobody help u by then, i'll see what i can d
[14:06:55] <tubbo> NoiseEee: i see one, but that's not what it is :)
[14:07:03] <tubbo> if it was, Array#some() would work on it
[14:07:04] <tubbo> and it doesn't
[14:07:10] <ink_> tubbo: $.makeArray ?
[14:07:16] <tubbo> are you serious lol
[14:07:24] <NoiseEee> tubbo: what are you trying to do?
[14:07:24] <tubbo> IT DOES EXIST ;)
[14:07:29] <ink_> i never joke about arrays
[14:07:32] <ink_> ever.
[14:07:56] <tubbo> wow
[14:08:00] <tubbo> that's fucking cool
[14:08:01] <tubbo> :)
[14:08:19] <ini> sounds good, much respect for dj's
[14:08:37] <ink_> it's amazing, cos it was really well hidden in google
[14:08:49] <tubbo> NoiseEee: i'm looking in a form for fields that have changed
[14:08:51] <ink_> eventually i found it by searching "jquery array"
[14:08:55] <Fidelix> Hello, is there any slider available with support for progressbars?
[14:09:09] <tubbo> and when i find one, i do a confirm("are you sure you want to save?"), then #some_form submits #account_main_form
[14:09:22] <tubbo> NoiseEee: basically, i have to validate one form onSubmit of another form, and submit both
[14:14:53] <ink_> ok
[14:15:02] <ink_> ini this is actually freaking me out
[14:15:02] <mrproper> hello. I want to work over all divs with 'item' class. I have a function that must to show an element during some second, hide it and then do the same with the next one. How can I iterate all elements without block the webpage?
[14:16:19] <ini> ink_ - how come?
[14:16:36] <ink_> $(this.hash) is returning weirdness
[14:16:43] <ini> ok, i thought it was just me
[14:16:51] <ink_> hang on, maybe need to refresh jsfiddled perhaps...
[14:16:55] <ini> i literally c/p'd from another procedure
[14:17:19] <ini> at best, i get 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of null '
[14:17:25] <ink_> hint:
[14:17:27] <ink_> console.dir
[14:17:31] <Fidelix> Can anyone please recommend a jquery slider with support for a progressbar? Like this one: http://codecanyon.net/item/li-jquery-sliderimage-rotator/full_screen_preview/153638
[14:17:41] <ink_> it's like alert only it does everything you secretly wish alert did
[14:17:58] <ink_> Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â console.dir($(this.hash));
[14:18:00] <ini> work in chrome?
[14:18:05] <ini> ok
[14:18:15] <ink_> brings us no closer to a solution, but at least we can see the problem
[14:18:24] <ink_> ofc, everything works in chrome
[14:18:28] <ink_> except for the addressbar
[14:18:43] <ink_> which i'm pretty sure is the result of some dark CIA conspiricy
[14:18:52] <ink_> why else cripple an otherwise brilliant browser
[14:18:53] <ink_> shit, brb
[14:18:59] <ini> ha
[14:18:59] <ini> ok
[14:19:20] <ini> my chome address bar seems to work fine :P
[14:19:24] <ini> operator failure
[14:19:53] <ink_> i want more than 5 results returned
[14:19:56] <ink_> your move.
[14:20:19] <jedimind> oh snap!
[14:20:21] <ziz> How do I get a bounce effect on hover? Any help is appreciated
[14:20:22] <ini> you don't need more than 5 if they are the right 5
[14:20:27] * jedimind sits back and munches on popcorn
[14:20:36] <ink_> you sound like the chrome devs
[14:20:46] <ziz> http://tolaw.highrankdev.com/ tried to do it on the first Plus mark icon
[14:20:47] <ziz> no luck
[14:20:50] <ini> i'll take that as a compliment
[14:20:56] <ink_> it's better now its supports history title search
[14:20:59] <ini> more than 5 in the address bar? seriously?
[14:21:10] <ink_> i has lots of internets
[14:21:10] <ini> thats what google.com is for
[14:21:18] <ink_> lol, i mean for history search
[14:21:26] <ini> oh ok
[14:21:35] <ini> yeah, oddly, history, and gmail search is lacking
[14:21:44] <ink_> FF (and no chrome) searches ur history titles
[14:22:05] <ink_> firefox does it brilliantly, and chrome seems to do it at random
[14:22:19] <ini> i'm really excited to see how this gets linked back to a jQuery issue... :P
[14:22:20] <ink_> with its artificially stupid history title search algo
[14:22:25] <ini> yeah
[14:22:30] <ink_> for my next trick...
[14:22:32] <ini> eventually it will be perfect
[14:22:37] <ini> i kid, i kid
[14:22:42] <ink_> it does seem to have improved to be honest
[14:22:47] <ink_> anyways
[14:22:59] <ink_> back to your leetal proplem
[14:23:18] <ini> i'm a student worker at my univerisity's IT dept.  I'm the only fan of Chrome, somehow
[14:23:42] <hugo_moss> what are they a fan of
[14:24:18] <ini> firefox
[14:24:25] <ini> i actually get made fun of
[14:24:33] <ini> but i'm working on it
[14:24:38] <ink_> right
[14:24:38] <ink_> well
[14:24:45] <ini> did refreshing fiddle fix it for you?
[14:24:57] <ink_> something fucking wrong
[14:24:59] <ink_> http://jsfiddle.net/QsCmu/2/
[14:25:08] <ink_> why wont it find your divs
[14:25:11] <ink_> oh god
[14:25:16] <hugo_moss> firefoxs progress is slowing
[14:25:22] <ink_> i've just found out why it wont find them
[14:25:26] <ink_> because they're wrong.
[14:25:29] <hugo_moss> chrome is great but the privacy is the only thing that bothers me
[14:25:44] <hugo_moss> i dont like how its linked to my google account
[14:26:05] <hugo_moss> if it wasnt for that, chrome is the most superior in my opinion
[14:26:06] <ink_> hugo_moss: then dont link it to a google account
[14:26:09] <ini> oh shit
[14:26:10] <ini> lol
[14:26:13] <ink_> yah ;)
[14:26:18] <ini> haha
[14:26:19] <ini> sorry man
[14:26:28] <ink_> ini: where's wally: Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â <divÂ id="#Alumni">
[14:26:30] <ink_> THERE HE IS
[14:26:35] <ini> yeah
[14:26:37] <ini> i be dumbass
[14:26:40] <hugo_moss> chrome is super fast
[14:26:48] <ini> but i just got a sweet Technics shirt :P
[14:26:58] <ink_> you're getting a pass
[14:26:59] <ink_> this once.
[14:27:13] <ini> i appreciate the generosity
[14:27:26] <ink_> another SERIOUS annoyance about chroe
[14:27:32] <ink_> fucking proxy settings
[14:27:35] <ink_> actually, i use firefox for one thing
[14:27:50] <ini> http://digitalpharaoh.co.uk/images/products/music/Technics_Tec9_T_Shirtl.gif
[14:27:57] <ink_> pen testing, cos i can configure a proxy easily
[14:28:06] <ink_> anyways, i was doing some shit with Burp suite today, so out comes FF
[14:28:15] <Fidelix> Can anyone please recommend a jquery slider with support for a progressbar? Like this one: http://codecanyon.net/item/li-jquery-sliderimage-rotator/full_screen_preview/153638
[14:28:25] <mocramis_> $('body').css({background: -moz-element(#canvas)); says me "#" is an illegal char. is there any way to still do the trick ?
[14:28:26] <ink_> and i have to say, its running fast nowdays, also the UI seems... less bloated
[14:28:42] <ink_> Fidelix: i think thats a no fella, sorry
[14:29:10] <ink_> have u tried google?
[14:29:23] <ink_> cos i deduct points if i google something obvious
[14:29:27] <ink_> and its on the first page
[14:29:32] <hugo_moss> yea i remember when i downloaded the new version of firefox
[14:29:33] <platzhirsch> Does jQuery offer something to filter an array of objects from duplicates?
[14:29:40] <hugo_moss> it was super faster than before
[14:29:57] <hugo_moss> i remember reading how proud they were of being able to make it so fast
[14:29:59] <ink_> BRO
[14:30:02] <nchlssmith1> mocramis_:-element('#canvas'))
[14:30:03] <hugo_moss> and re-engineering it
[14:30:04] <ink_> NO POINTS FOR YOU
[14:30:12] <ink_> "jquery image slider bar"
[14:30:24] <ink_> SURELY thats easier than spamming irc
[14:30:43] <ink_> it was super faster than before
[14:30:51] <ink_> i'm getting that on a tshirt ^^
[14:31:02] <hugo_moss> make me one too plz
[14:31:29] <NoiseEee> platzhirsch: it does if the objects in question are dom elements ;)  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.unique/
[14:31:54] <platzhirsch> NoiseEee: that's unfortunately not the case
[14:31:56] <NoiseEee> platzhirsch: but see http://paulirish.com/2010/duck-punching-with-jquery/
[14:33:18] <ziz> Hey guys I have the bounce effect on the two boxes in the header on http://tolaw.highrankdev.com/ how can I make it so that only the child "plus icon" bounces, instead of both
[14:33:49] <platzhirsch1> NoiseEee: that's really cool, so you speak of unique enhancement
[14:34:00] <mocramis_> nchlssmith1, thanks... however, now i get "error, moz is not defined
[14:34:25] <KWhat_Work> If i create a few nested elements when _destroy gets called I should only need to call .remove() on the bottom most element correct?
[14:34:36] <mocramis_> i cant manage to set body:background to -moz-element dinamically :(
[14:35:19] <ink_> duck punching
[14:35:20] <ink_> awesome.
[14:35:31] <ink_> i've always wanted to go one on one with a swan
[14:35:37] <ink_> i could fucking take one, i know it
[14:35:44] <ink_> just gotta watch the beak
[14:35:50] <nchlssmith1> mocramis_: moz element?
[14:35:56] <platzhirsch1> NoiseEee: ok it seems that basically I was looking for the === operator
[14:36:10] <ink_> ive now gone beyond the point where im any use to anyone
[14:36:12] <ink_> ciao for now people
[14:36:21] <ini> geese will flank you, too
[14:36:28] <ini> er, swans
[14:36:34] <ink_> dont talk to me about geese
[14:36:37] <ink_> you seen the fuckers
[14:36:40] <ink_> they got fucking teeth
[14:36:48] <ink_> a swan maybe, but i aint takin on a goose
[14:36:53] <ink_> thats just reckless
[14:36:54] <ini> thats why i carry a turtle at all times
[14:36:59] <Fidelix> ink_: SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
[14:37:04] <ink_> i love this channel.
[14:37:06] <ini> 'ball up little buddy, you're going in'
[14:37:12] <Fidelix> You are ridiculous.
[14:37:20] <Fidelix> I searched. I searched. I searched.
[14:37:21] <ink_> *hangs head*
[14:37:37] <ink_> and what did u find?
[14:37:41] <mocramis_> nchlssmith1, hahhahahaahha i succeed : $('body').css("background", "-moz-element(#canvas)");
[14:37:53] <mocramis_> thanks everyone, il love you :)
[14:37:59] <Fidelix> The search you suggested returns nothing
[14:38:07] <nchlssmith1> mocramis_: awsome that looks a lot better. =)
[14:38:10] <Fidelix> NOTHING
[14:38:11] <mocramis_> nchlssmith1, it allows to use canvas as background
[14:38:22] <ink_> "jquery image slider bar"
[14:38:28] <ink_> i searched thata
[14:38:29] <mocramis_> but i need some script to be able to rune on ff or webkit
[14:38:33] <ink_> and found about 75 things.
[14:38:33] <Fidelix> Yes, that's exactly what I searched
[14:38:44] <ink_> then how did it get to this?
[14:38:53] <ink_> "30+Â jQuery Image SliderÂ Plugins and Tutorials"
[14:38:53] <mrproper> can anyone help me with this http://pastebin.com/qCUJ7jzr ? I want to know why current variable don't change its value in each iteration
[14:38:59] <ink_> "40+ FreshÂ jQuery ImageÂ And ContentÂ SlidersÂ Plugins"
[14:39:00] <Fidelix> Oh yeah? Then link it right here to me. A damn jquery slideshow with support for progress bars.
[14:39:05] <ink_> "21 BrilliantÂ jQuery Image Gallery/Slideshow Plugins"
[14:39:10] <ink_> these are all literally
[14:39:12] <ink_> page 1
[14:39:15] <ink_> not to mention
[14:39:19] <ink_> "WOW Slider :Â jQuery Image SliderÂ & Gallery"
[14:39:19] <Fidelix> Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.
[14:39:23] <Fidelix> Learn the fucking read.
[14:39:27] <ink_> which looks better than u posted
[14:39:31] <ink_> (22:39:18) Fidelix: Learn the fucking read.
[14:39:45] <ink_> seriously. i'm enjoying this channel/
[14:39:46] <Fidelix> From the beggining, I'm asking for a slideshow script with support for a progressbar
[14:39:54] <ink_> bro
[14:39:56] <Fidelix> These search results have NOTHING
[14:40:10] <ink_> either i'm an idiot
[14:40:13] <ink_> or your and idiot
[14:40:13] <KWhat_Work> What is the point of using _on?
[14:40:26] <ink_> look again
[14:40:40] <ini> this escalated quickly
[14:40:47] <ink_> i know right
[14:40:51] <ink_> u got that turtle still?
[14:41:07] <Fidelix> ink_: I challenge you to post a link right here to a demo of a script with support for progressbar. From that search you made.
[14:41:08] <ini_> he's all tucked in
[14:41:16] <ink_> http://wowslider.com/
[14:41:21] <ink_> #1 result
[14:41:26] * ini_ puts a helmet on the turtle
[14:41:27] <ink_> see the little dots?
[14:41:37] <ink_> the ones that change depending on your progress>
[14:41:42] <Fidelix> I don't see the FUCKING PROGRESS BAR YOU SON OF A WHORE.
[14:41:46] <ink_> just like the one u posted
[14:41:49] <ini_> maybe he means a different KIND of progress bar
[14:41:54] <Fidelix> Jesus christ
[14:41:56] <ink_> i see.
[14:41:57] <ini_> not progress dots
[14:42:00] <ini_> clearly
[14:42:07] <ini_> dots != bar
[14:42:08] <Fidelix> Why didn't you look at the link I gave you?
[14:42:31] <Fidelix> <Fidelix> Can anyone please recommend a jquery slider with support for a progressbar? Like this one: http://codecanyon.net/item/li-jquery-sliderimage-rotator/full_screen_preview/153638
[14:42:32] <ink_> i did
[14:42:39] <Fidelix> No, you did not
[14:42:39] <ink_> and i see dots all the way
[14:42:45] <ini_> haha
[14:43:00] <Fidelix> And don't you see the progress bar?
[14:43:02] <ini_> im looking for a slider, with progress squares
[14:43:22] <Fidelix> Right at the bottom of the image there is a progress indicator for each slide
[14:43:34] <ink_> ...
[14:43:44] <Fidelix> That is a progress bar
[14:43:57] <ink_> can somebody else look
[14:44:01] <ini_> i see it
[14:44:08] <ini_> its a timer for when the picture will change
[14:44:14] <Fidelix> I'll make this easier for you, ink_: http://i47.tinypic.com/mb3eo9.png
[14:44:15] <ini_> its pretty light tho
[14:44:22] <haohui> hi folks
[14:44:25] <ini_> at the bottom of the picture frame
[14:44:30] <Fidelix> You seem to have a mental disease, so I'll have more patience.
[14:44:36] <ink_> wtf, i literally cant see that
[14:44:40] <ink_> my bad i guess
[14:44:42] <ini_> haohui, if you have a turtle, get it ready
[14:44:51] <Fidelix> Then I'm not the idiot. YOU ARE.
[14:44:59] <Fidelix> Stop assuming people are stupid, for the love of god.
[14:45:03] <ink_> i said that was a possibility
[14:45:15] <Fidelix> OK. Thanks for trying to help, then.
[14:45:21] <ini_> Fidelix, it was easy to misinterpret your meaning of 'progress bar'
[14:45:25] <ink_> and this is weird as fuck, my browser isn't rendering it
[14:45:31] <ink_> ANYWAY, Fidelix
[14:45:39] <haohui> do you know how jquery selector is implemented? I'll trying to follow the code path of $('#id')
[14:45:42] <Fidelix> ini_: sorry but progressbar only has 1 meaning for this context.
[14:45:47] <nchlssmith1> Im still stuck on the turtle needing a helmet.  =)
[14:45:47] <ink_> no
[14:45:49] <ini_> haha
[14:45:51] <ink_> it really doest
[14:45:53] <ini_> to you, i'm sure it does
[14:45:59] <ink_> i'm afraid i dont know any extensions like this
[14:46:06] <ink_> that said, i dont think it would be very hard to implement
[14:46:10] <ini_> but to the rest of us, you could measure the progress of the slideshow itself
[14:46:15] <Fidelix> No. A bar that shows progress. That's what a progressbar is.
[14:46:23] <ini_> Yes
[14:46:25] <Fidelix> I did not say progress indicator
[14:46:29] <Fidelix> I said progress BAR
[14:46:42] <ini_> but you also need to understand that there are a lot of coders with English as a second language
[14:46:43] <ink_> i was wrong
[14:46:53] <ink_> ive had a lot of practice
[14:46:56] <Fidelix> ini_: I am one of those. I am Brazilian.
[14:47:05] <ink_> im fucked off cos chrome doesn't seem to display it for me
[14:47:08] <ini_> And your English is very good
[14:47:17] <ini_> ink_ - my chome does
[14:47:25] <ini_> see? operator failure
[14:47:27] <ink_> showoff.
[14:47:55] <ink_> AAHHH
[14:48:04] <ink_> the little bar thing at the top
[14:48:09] <ink_> now ive closed it
[14:48:11] <ink_> it orks
[14:48:18] <ini_> yours is at the top?
[14:48:32] <ink_> no there was a little bar ith some kind of message in i had to close
[14:48:34] <ini_> now apologize to Fidelix for being a son of a whore
[14:48:39] <Fidelix> There is a script that does what I need, but it does not have any methods or callbacks. And that sucks
[14:49:06] <Fidelix> This one: http://thiagosf.net/projects/jquery/skitter/
[14:49:08] <ini_> What sucks more is your piss-poor attitude
[14:49:15] <ink_> right, Fidelix, sorry my bad. lets not fall out over it, i do think what we have may blossom into a beautiful friendship
[14:49:22] <haohui> does anyone know how to reach the developers of jquery?
[14:49:29] <Fidelix> That's fine. I apologize as well.
[14:49:33] <Smittles> I would think this channel is a good start
[14:49:49] <ink_> i dont kno of any myself, sorry
[14:50:07] <ink_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[14:50:54] <ink_> oh sorry, they use their own bugtracker... i'd try jquery.com, but i'd imagine they get a lot of mail so if its a bug or something, try using their bugtracker
[14:51:13] <haohui> great. sounds like they don't hang out here.
[14:51:36] <ink_> im sure they do from time to time
[14:51:53] <hugo_moss> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFAEYWQl1eM
[14:51:56] <ink_> why do you need to contact them?
[14:52:29] <haohui> jquery is slow. Figuring out how to fix it
[14:52:43] <ink_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJMLJVha5sw
[14:52:49] <ink_> haohui: slow in what sense?
[14:53:05] <ini_> it don't learn so good
[14:53:08] <ink_> ive not heard it called slo before
[14:53:13] <haohui> http://jsperf.com/jquery-sharp-vs-getelementbyid/18
[14:53:40] <ink_> wow thats slo
[14:53:58] <ink_> i'd be very interested to see zepto's performance measured...
[14:54:36] <ink_> http://jsperf.com/getelementbyid-vs-jquery-and-zepto-id-selector/3
[14:54:40] <ink_> lets see what we get...
[14:55:06] <ink_> slower even :p
[14:55:27] <ini_> is zepto good? haven't heard of it
[14:55:32] <ink_> very imo
[14:55:50] <ink_> if u dont need to support broken older browsers (mobile dev for example)
[14:55:54] <Eviltwin> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl's_law
[14:56:05] <ini_> how mature is it?
[14:56:30] <ink_> and like the idea of a very very minimal jquery with a module build then check it out
[14:56:50] <ink_> it's by the same guy who wrote scripaculous (never used)
[14:57:17] <ini_> that means nothing to me
[14:57:25] <ini_> i might even be a little offended
[14:57:33] <ink_> and it's 1 year +
[14:57:41] <ink_> modular*
[14:58:06] <ink_> im doing some weird fucking things with dynamic iframe
[14:58:20] <ink_> s. and weird event binding and all manner of strangeness
[14:58:30] <ink_> targetted at modern browsers and smartphones
[14:58:35] <ink_> and ive run into 1 bug so far
[14:58:40] <ink_> which was also present in jquery
[14:58:44] <ini_> that sounds pretty good
[14:58:50] <ink_> http://zeptojs.com/
[14:58:51] <utkarshc`> Hi
[14:58:58] <ink_> i heartily recommend you try it
[14:59:14] <utkarshc`> I was wondering if any one knows, if jquery.tools validator works with IE9? For the life of it, It works with everything else, but IE8, IE9.. I believe IE9 has HTML5 compatibility
[14:59:30] <ini_> but, as those tests showed, its way slower :P
[15:07:26] <KWhat_Work> Does mywidget._setOptions call the _setOption of the parent or child
[15:23:48] <dennisbot> hi! can I load multiple js files in a single <script src="file1.js, file2.js, ... , filen.js"></script>
[15:23:54] <dennisbot> ?
[15:24:56] <Snerf> I have a checkbox button I hve on my page #cb .. I have an iframe on the page, and in it, I can reference #cb using $(parent.window.document).find('#cb'), and I can change the attr('checked') , but doing a .button('refresh') does not seem to want to work from the iframe'd file, I do have jq/jqui referenced in the iframe file. No idea why I cant refresh the button.
[15:25:46] <coldhead> dennisbot: no you can't
[15:25:57] <coldhead> but you can join them all into a single file on the server and load that!
[15:26:26] <dennisbot> but I've already saw a web site that contain that sentence
[15:26:36] <dennisbot> and I was wondering if it's possible
[15:33:46] <Keu> dennisbot: what was the site that you saw?
[15:33:56] <coldhead> lies.com
[15:34:04] <dennisbot> http://www.behance.net/
[15:34:07] <dennisbot> thanks for the interest
[15:35:00] <dennisbot> ctrl + U go to the line 76 , here in my chrome browser said it
[15:35:47] <coldhead> that is a single file
[15:35:51] <shoky> dennisbot: that is one big url, not seperate ones
[15:35:59] <coldhead> it's requesting a resource that concatenates the files into one
[15:36:09] <Keu> what they said
[15:37:47] <dennisbot> mmm so its just a name for recall that that file load many files that are labeled like the files separated by commas?
[15:38:47] <shoky> no, its a url that tells the server to put all those files into one big file and send it to the browser
[15:39:09] <Snerf> no ideas?
[15:39:53] <shaft0> I've got two forms with identical names of fields, and I'm trying to use jQuery to get all the values from form 1, and put them into the values of the corresponding fields for form 2.  I'm doing this: http://pastebin.com/MNEkFCAW , but it's not working, and not throwing any errors.  Any ideas?
[15:40:10] <shoky> Snerf: have you tried referncing the parent window's jquery? e.g.  parent.window.jQuery( parent.window.document ).find('#cb')
[15:41:18] <shoky> donno if that first step is needed
[15:42:03] <black_warlock> i finisheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeddddddddddddd
[15:42:37] <black_warlock> who need a fantastic sortable menu with infinite sub ul ?
[15:42:39] <dennisbot> shoky: thanks, how can I test or see that big file?
[15:43:01] <dennisbot> shoky:I mean, making a test in my localhost
[15:43:27] <shoky> shaft0: use .val(...)   not .attr('value',...)
[15:43:43] <black_warlock> pepepepepepepepe
[15:44:30] <shoky> dennisbot: no idea about your localhost.. but the file is in that url: http://assets.behance.net/min/b=assets/js&f=utils/es5-shim.js,jquery/jquery.js,jquery/jquery.ui.core.js,jquery/jquery.ui.widget.js,jquery/jquery.ui.mouse.js,jquery/jquery.ui.position.js,jquery/jquery.ui.coreext.js,jquery/jquery.ui.selectmenu.js,utils/DirtyWarning.js,Core.js,Fn.js,Core/Class.js,Core/Events.js,Core/Model.js,Core/View.js,Core/View/Entity.js,Core/View/Element.js,Core/View/Dialo
[15:44:33] <shoky> ;S
[15:44:34] <shoky> sry
[15:45:14] <dennisbot> shoky: xD! thanks , sorry but I'm a newbie
[15:47:33] <shoky> shaft0:  and also you did .attr('val')  instead of attr('value')
[15:47:46] <shoky> shaft0: but just use .val() instead
[15:48:23] <utkarshc`> @black_warlock ThAT IS AWESOME! I could use one
[15:49:53] <shaft0> ohh!  That'd do it!
[15:49:53] <shaft0> hahaha, thanks!
[15:50:17] <shaft0> I knew there had to be something simple.
[15:53:27] <thinkerweb> Hi, if I make a list clickable with $(".class-name").click(function(){...}); can I then access the id as so: var currentid=$(this).attr('id');  ,
[15:54:08] <platzhirsch1> I have defined a $.getJSON callback function, unfortunately using variables from the loop code above, but since the function is only defined once it stucks with the value of the first loop iteration. Is it possible to pass data to the function so it uses the current value?
[15:55:22] <platzhirsch1> Closure is the answer I guess
[15:55:25] <black_warlock> hahahahahaha
[15:55:46] <black_warlock> utkarshc` you wish it :P
[15:56:24] <platzhirsch1> yep closure it is
[15:57:47] <robgleeson> how would I avoid selecting inputs without a name?
[15:58:16] <thinkerweb> what is the syntax for this: $(this) ?
[15:59:36] <coldhead> robgleeson: $(':input[name]')
[16:00:01] <coldhead> thinkerweb: that will wrap this in jQuery goodness, yes
[16:00:09] <coldhead> $(this).fadeOut('slow'); // etc
[16:00:44] <thinkerweb> coldhead, thx
[16:01:45] <black_warlock> i made sortable menu , with infinite sub cat , interfaceble with dynamic pages......
[16:02:42] <coldhead> that sounds pretty serious
[16:04:54] <thinkerweb> can I use attr or css to change the z-index of an element?
[16:05:09] <thang> thinkerweb: css, yes
[16:05:10] <coldhead> css
[16:05:13] <thinkerweb> can I use .attr() or .css() to change the z-index of an element?
[16:05:18] <Dr4g> 	var iframe = $('.contents iframe').contents();
[16:05:18] <Dr4g> Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function
[16:05:18] <thinkerweb> thang no for attr?
[16:05:35] <Dr4g> This code works fine in chrome devtools - but i get this error upon page load :S
[16:05:36] <thang> z-index is a css property
[16:05:38] <Dr4g> Help ?
[16:06:05] <coldhead> ?contents
[16:06:05] <bot-t> .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[16:06:08] <thinkerweb> $(".product").click(function() {	$(this)	$(this).css("z-index", 10);    .css("z-index", 10);
[16:06:12] <coldhead> hmm
[16:06:22] <coldhead> can you put a demo up on jsfiddle, Dr4g ?
[16:06:32] <coldhead> it might be some horrible cross domain security issue :(
[16:06:35] <Dr4g> coldhead: i think i'll get cross-domain problems.
[16:06:41] <Dr4g> well its the same website dude.
[16:06:43] <Dr4g> here..
[16:06:46] <thinkerweb> $(".product").click(function() {$(this).css("z-index", 10);    doesn't work for me
[16:06:58] <Dr4g> coldhead: http://dev.ppi.io/docs/application.html
[16:07:07] <Dr4g> docs.js:28
[16:08:18] <coldhead> no Dr4g
[16:08:25] <jaha> Anyone know what might be causing this? https://github.com/jackmoore/colorbox/issues/266
[16:08:26] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #266 on colorbox (danielmahon; 10.882s ago): incorrect colorbox size with ajax content
[16:08:31] <coldhead> it's becuase you're overwriting $
[16:08:42] <coldhead> .load(function ($) {
[16:08:47] <Dr4g> that's localised?
[16:08:52] <coldhead> that is causing $ = this;
[16:09:07] <thang> thinkerweb: print out the z-index before and after the $(this).css line to ensure its changing
[16:09:08] <coldhead> if you use jQuery instead of $ within the fn it should work
[16:09:30] <Dr4g> coldhead: i don't believe you - i'll do this:
[16:09:31] <Dr4g> var iframe = jQuery('.contents iframe').contents();
[16:09:45] <thinkerweb> thang: "echo $(this).css;"
[16:09:49] <coldhead> fine by me, Dr4g, it's my first day using jQuery
[16:09:59] <coldhead> i can only lead you astray at this point
[16:10:23] <thinkerweb> thang, oh no: alert( $this).css );
[16:10:28] <ericwx001> hola
[16:10:35] <Dr4g> coldhead: the $ char is localised inside this callback to .load()
[16:10:38] <Dr4g> it's totally cool
[16:10:54] <ericwx001> if i use .find("a")
[16:10:58] <ericwx001> that should find the first a href
[16:11:01] <ericwx001> ?
[16:11:21] <thang> thinkerweb: well, if you want something less intrusive do console.log($(this).css('z-index')); and open up the console
[16:11:23] <coldhead> Dr4g: console.log($) inside the function and you'll see it's an Event, not jQuery
[16:11:30] <Dr4g> coldhead: hmm, ok
[16:11:32] <coldhead> ?load
[16:11:33] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[16:11:45] <coldhead> it's the event which is passed to handler
[16:11:45] <robgleeson> how can I bind dynamically? What I mean is I'd like .autocomplete(â€¦) to work for all elements matching a selector but that selector might be matched by elements that dont exist yet
[16:12:33] <Dr4g> coldhead: cheer - fixing it.
[16:12:35] <Dr4g> cheers *
[16:12:39] <coldhead> yay!
[16:13:17] <ericwx001> i'm trying to find all links in a html document, find it's parent div id, then find the first-child div and add rel="" to it
[16:13:33] <Dr4g> coldhead: WOOOOO! :D
[16:13:35] <Dr4g> thanks dude.
[16:14:09] <thinkerweb> I have some element that over lap each other, and I made them clickable using .click(), when I click them I change the z-index to 10, and yet, I don't see the element raised.
[16:14:57] <coldhead> thinkerweb: might need to play with the CSS in your debugger
[16:15:04] <coldhead> needs to be position:absolute
[16:15:07] <coldhead> or the parent does
[16:15:09] <coldhead> or something
[16:15:12] <coldhead> z-indexes are hard
[16:15:57] <thinkerweb> is there another way I can raise them above/below, or is z-index the only way?
[16:16:04] <coldhead> it's the only way
[16:16:11] <coldhead> that's what z-index is for
[16:16:17] <thinkerweb> true
[16:16:30] <thang> robgleeson: are these elements arbitrarily added, or can you be made aware of when something added? [eg request when user scrolls to bottom of page to load more items, or what have you]
[16:20:12] <thinkerweb> can I get the element id of an element I've selected using .click()
[16:20:19] <robgleeson> thang: well, it is complicated. those elements are added later on, and when they are I need to call $('selector').autocomplete(â€¦) so that it works for the newly added elements.
[16:20:20] <thinkerweb> and its classname
[16:20:31] <robgleeson> thinkerweb: .live() looks good but not for use with .autocomplete(â€¦);.
[16:20:43] <robgleeson> thang: ^
[16:21:36] <robgleeson> any ideas? =)
[16:22:38] <thinkerweb> how do I select the child sibling element, if I have a bunch of div's clickable using click() with common class name
[16:22:52] <ericwx001> :first-child
[16:22:58] <thang> robgleeson: well i cant say for sure, but ive had a similar problem.. the thing is i was making ajax requests to load more elements so i just added a hook after i appended the html to the page to add the necessary handler
[16:24:29] <thinkerweb> how do you select the next sibling using sibling()?
[16:24:56] <thang> robgleeson: you might have some luck with .on()
[16:24:58] <thinkerweb> got it .next()
[16:26:10] <drTerminal> hi all
[16:26:48] <drTerminal> is there another built-in function like 'confirm' in jquery? confirm is a plugin-like i guess
[16:26:53] <drTerminal> i need built-in one
[16:26:56] <drTerminal> .
[16:27:51] <Snerf> ok.. by adding and removeing the ui-state-active class, works.. but now the next fun part :)
[16:28:05] <ericwx001> how can i take the text from a div and place it in the rel="text here" ??
[16:28:29] <thinkerweb> How can I chain in a toggle into $(".product").click(function() {, $(".product").click().toggle(function() {
[16:28:35] <MistuhKurtz> so I need a click handler that works like toggle() http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/ but I can't use toggle because I need to check a condition before calling event.preventDefault();
[16:28:45] <MistuhKurtz> what's a nice succinct way of doing that?
[16:29:00] <drTerminal> is there another built-in function like 'confirm' in jquery? confirm is a plugin-like i guess
[16:29:10] <ericwx001> it's for analytics but the first part is done, it's currently creating the rel="Container - "
[16:29:24] <MistuhKurtz> I know I can invert a boolean but then I have a variable outside the scope of my click function
[16:29:32] <ericwx001> but it should be rel="Container - TEXT FROM DIV HERE WHICH IS ACTUALLY A TITLE OF A TAB"
[16:29:46] <thinkerweb> orI just use toggle instead of click eh
[16:30:28] <MistuhKurtz> lol I'm glad my question answered your question thinkerweb
[16:30:47] <jonkri> why does $('<div>hello</div>').innerHTML return undefined? is it because it's not in the dom tree?
[16:30:47] <someprimetime> how can I fade in an element and add an eventHandler to it? e.g. $('.foobar').fadeIn().click(function() { alert('clicked me!')});
[16:31:16] <razzi> jonkri, try .innerHTML()
[16:31:34] <razzi> ericwx001, the rel attribute of same div?
[16:31:35] <u89> jonkri: because $('<div>hello</div>') doesn't return a DOM element
[16:31:43] <Snerf> how does one chage the background image with .css() ?
[16:32:48] <KWhat_Work> When using this._super() do I need to do something special to call the same method of the widget I extended? It seems to be returning this.element for some reason
[16:32:49] <someprimetime> Snerf: $('.foobar').css('background-image', 'newimg.png');
[16:33:23] <MistuhKurtz> someprimetime, needs to be 'url(newimg.png)'
[16:33:47] <someprimetime> yeah, that
[16:33:50] <Snerf> someprimetime, hhm, no change. well, more digging
[16:34:08] <someprimetime> Snerf: ^^
[16:34:08] <Snerf> its for a checkbox/button icon
[16:34:13] <KWhat_Work> eh I seem to have eff something
[16:34:24] <Snerf> someprimetime, I added url(), no diff
[16:34:30] <someprimetime> how can I chain a fadeIn() and attach an event handler?
[16:35:12] <Snerf> jonkri, its .html()
[16:36:56] <ericwx001> using .closest('div')
[16:37:02] <ericwx001> how do i find the closest div class
[16:37:13] <someprimetime> lolwut
[16:37:40] <KWhat_Work> I am trying to understand function arguments, basically this http://pastebin.com/LNhZ5Txb is not functioning the way that .val() does in jquery. How do i duplicate that kind of optional behavior
[16:37:41] <thinkerweb> if some thing flies of the right in side a div with overflow hidden, is there a way to retrieve it
[16:38:06] <someprimetime> Snerf: http://jsfiddle.net/sH9e3/
[16:38:13] <ericwx001> if the grass is greener on the other side, and you go to the other side, is the grass still greener?
[16:38:29] <MistuhKurtz> yes, but it's still on the other side.
[16:38:31] <MistuhKurtz> :P
[16:38:43] <ericwx001> damn. -.- this isn't going to work
[16:48:03] <Snerf> ah well, guess changing the background image/icon for a ui-button works differently
[16:48:06] <Snerf> back to the drawing board
[16:49:06] <lethjakman_work> hey
[16:49:15] <lethjakman_work> how do I tell if a selector exists? I want to stick it inside of an if
[16:49:20] <lethjakman_work> such as if($('.property-value textarea')) console.log(true);
[16:49:24] <MistuhKurtz> Can anyone explain why http://jsfiddle.net/kvcrawford/JNtKE/  logs as "true" every time and http://jsfiddle.net/kvcrawford/JNtKE/1/ alternates as expected?
[16:49:41] <MistuhKurtz> OHHH
[16:49:42] <MistuhKurtz> derp
[16:49:43] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[16:50:00] <lethjakman_work> lol
[16:51:32] <Dr4g> lethjakman_work: use .length
[16:51:40] <lethjakman_work> hm,  that's actually what I'm doing...
[16:51:46] <Dr4g> if($('some-selector').length > 0) { â€¦ }
[16:51:46] <lethjakman_work> I might be doing something else wrong
[16:51:58] <lethjakman_work> my exact code:
[16:52:03] <lethjakman_work> https://gist.github.com/1819eb0110ae8c062715
[16:52:22] <Dr4g> and does it get inside there? console.log() that out.
[16:52:42] <lethjakman_work> ok, one sec
[16:53:44] <webmaven> If anyone here is familiar with flotcharts, I'd appreciate some a minimal example of using the bullet chart plugin: https://github.com/ReturnPath/flot-plugins
[16:54:05] <lethjakman_work> Dr4g: nope, it doesn't
[16:54:27] <lethjakman_work> but $('.property-value textarea').length returns 1
[16:54:35] <Dr4g> impossible ;)
[16:55:19] <lethjakman_work> Dr4g: oh! it's skipping my onload for some reason...
[16:55:36] <webmaven> The following attempt at using the bullet chart plugin doesn't work:
[16:55:48] <webmaven>             $.plot($("#placeholder"), [[0,50]],{
[16:55:49] <webmaven>                 series: { bullet: true },
[16:55:49] <webmaven>                });
[16:56:19] <Dr4g> lethjakman_work: good luck ;)
[16:56:36] <lethjakman_work> thanks
[16:57:53] <friskd> Hey folks. I'm looking for a practical way for handling the case where 3rd party libs that I have integrated into my site don't cause my js to break down.
[16:57:56] <friskd> For example.
[16:58:07] <friskd> We want to integrate Mixpanel in for tracking/analytics.
[16:58:35] <friskd> But this of course requries that we pull in their JS file using their little js snippte.
[16:59:00] <friskd> But if their site goes down. And i'm using their libs all over my code. BAM. My whole site could stop working.
[16:59:27] <friskd> Is there some suggested way to got about dealing w/ things like this.
[17:02:02] <lethjakman_work> hm, so this is weird....I have a $(document).ready(function() { that isn't executing. Although the code seems to run into it through breakpoints, and it's just skipped over. Although it does run through  jquery.
[17:04:34] <robgleeson> hm!
[17:04:43] <robgleeson> .autocomplete(â€¦) can work on multiple inputs on the same page, right?
[17:04:57] <robgleeson> because my testing is saying no which is weird.
[17:08:23] <webmaven> So, no flotcharts users here, huh?
[17:09:07] <robgleeson> anyone have any debugging tips for that>
[17:09:09] <robgleeson> ?*
[17:12:26] <coldhead> i've used flot, webmaven, but not the plugins and i don't know what you actually need help with
[17:13:41] <thinkerweb> whats wrongs with this: http://jsfiddle.net/g6WtL/1/
[17:14:02] <webmaven> coldhead: If you take a look at the bullet chart plugin, and can give me a minimal example that actually works, that is all I need.
[17:14:04] <thinkerweb> .products works but .expandright breaks it
[17:14:23] <thinkerweb> oh i see it
[17:15:36] <coldhead> lemme try, webmaven
[17:15:46] <webmaven> coldhead: Thanks!
[17:16:06] <lethjakman_work> any clue why this wouldn't run?
[17:16:08] <lethjakman_work> http://jsfiddle.net/lethjakman/BmkdA/
[17:16:26] <lethjakman_work> I run into the ready but it just skips over it
[17:20:25] <coldhead> webmaven: http://jsfiddle.net/TLXv8/
[17:20:40] <coldhead> not sure if that's right but it produces SOMETHING with output and no errors
[17:25:08] <webmaven> coldhead: it isn't right. Take a look at the image in the README: https://github.com/ReturnPath/flot-plugins
[17:29:53] <coldhead> i'm in the same position as you, webmaven
[17:30:00] <coldhead> i don't know how to reverse engineer that PNG
[17:30:48] <webmaven> coldhead: I was hoping that there was some obvious way of invoking the plugin I wasn't getting. Thanks for trying.
[17:31:38] <coldhead> my code has it working! it's just his weirdo options
[17:32:09] <dblosevn> hmm @ weirdo options
[17:33:36] <coldhead> webmaven: why don't you email the author https://github.com/eriwen
[17:33:55] <coldhead> at the very least it will persuade him not to list his email on github
[17:34:48] <webmaven> coldhead: Well, I filed an issue requesting an example be added. Maybe that will work
[17:34:56] <thinkerweb> can I use .animate({ margin-left: "-80px" }, 500);
[17:35:17] <coldhead> i saw that webmaven. i was like "huh, someone with the same issue... oh... same someone"
[17:35:26] <coldhead> but emails add urgency :D
[17:35:31] <coldhead> i'll email him too
[17:36:09] <thinkerweb> oh, I gotta use marginLeft, not margin-left
[17:40:50] <webmaven> coldhead: email sent. ;-)
[17:42:18] <Fallout2man> Is there a way to grab a full local copy of the jQuery mobile website for testing? I'm trying to test jQuery mobile's performance on a Content delivery platform called Viva. We need to see if we can use it with jQueryMobile, specifically to test animations and I don't really have time to write something myself. But the documentation page has everything I could need.
[17:42:33] <Fallout2man> err the jQuery Mobile website's documentation*
[17:43:11] <coldhead> it's all in here, Fallout2man https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/master/docs
[17:43:19] <coldhead> just download the repo from github
[17:43:41] <Fallout2man> coldhead: Danke! :D Looking forward to trying to my first project with jQuery mobile.
[17:43:49] <coldhead> good luck!
[17:43:57] <coldhead> there's #jquerymobile on freenode, too
[17:44:28] <Fallout2man> coldhead: I tried asking there first, no response.
[17:44:45] <coldhead> no response YET :)
[17:44:59] <coldhead> it's more sensitive to timezones than jQuery

[17:53:53] <abjorn> not a lot
[17:58:53] <imsky> abjorn: hows that promotion working out
[18:01:21] <robgleeson> how can I select the nearest tag with data-foo-bar set?
[18:01:47] <imsky> $("whatever").closest("*[data-foo-bar"])
[18:02:12] <abjorn> imsky: What promotion?
[18:02:24] <imsky> raise whatever
[18:05:35] <robgleeson> imsky: thanks, but hrmâ€¦ didnt seem to work. FWIW its something like: <div> <input> <input> </div> and I want to select the first input from the second input, if that makes sense.
[18:05:51] <robgleeson> $('second-input').closest(â€¦);
[18:05:55] <robgleeson> returns nothing for me.
[18:07:06] <imsky> robgleeson: try $().parent().closest()
[18:11:02] <abjorn> imsky: Oh, uh, haven't gotten paid with the raise yet so
[18:11:35] <imsky> be strong brother
[18:11:41] <imsky> also what are you up to?
[18:11:44] <imsky> guitaring it up as uzh?
[18:12:06] <abjorn> nah
[18:12:37] <abjorn> watching top gear about to play some LoL
[18:12:40] <robgleeson> imsky: .parent().children() works, I get an array and the input element I want is there but I can i snuff it out? I thought .find() might work but apparently not.
[18:12:48] <imsky> .filter() @ robgleeson
[18:12:52] <robgleeson> imsky: thanks!
[18:13:06] <imsky> abjorn: sounds like a sweet wednesday night friend. you doing anything with proto/etc?

[18:18:18] <hawkphil> hi all
[18:18:52] <hawkphil> is there any website that can explain Deferred and Promise in simple term? Like I am confused about the flow of when what being called, etc...
[18:32:49] <robgleeson> is it possible to say "find me any element with an id of *foo" where * is ANYTHING?
[18:33:18] <coldhead> $('[id$="foo"]')
[18:33:32] <robgleeson> how does that work?
[18:33:41] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[18:33:49] <coldhead> $ is regex for "end of the string"
[18:34:03] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-ends-with-selector/
[18:34:29] <coldhead> it will be much faster and simpler if you can just use an appropriate class though
[18:34:32] <robgleeson> can I escape with \ ?
[18:34:40] <coldhead> sure, why not
[18:34:52] <coldhead> you probably need to escape the escape: \\
[18:34:54] <coldhead> ?tias
[18:34:55] <bot-t> Try It And See
[18:35:01] <robgleeson> like $('foo').filter('input[id$=\[foo\]]');
[18:35:03] <coldhead> thanks bot-t !
[18:35:15] <coldhead> ya that will want double slashes
[18:39:30] <robgleeson> thanks coldhead !
[18:39:38] <robgleeson> jQuery is so awesome & so much fun :) â€¦ as is JS.
[18:39:41] <robgleeson> I come from Ruby.
[18:39:45] <robgleeson> just getting my bearings with JS.
[18:39:52] <robgleeson> selector syntax in jQuery is *so* powerful.
[18:40:11] <coldhead> it's the Query in jQuery
[18:46:30] <robgleeson> /buffer 3
[18:47:06] <ThePepe> hi
[18:47:58] <ThePepe> is there any way to manually set the slider control from jqueryui?
[18:48:11] <ThePepe> to manually set the value of*
[18:49:08] <coldhead> ThePepe: http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#method-value
[19:12:23] <hola> Can someone tell me how to fix this so it will get the window size on load? http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/ycUB6/670/
[19:21:13] <thomasgriffin> Question: Can you increment dashes?
[19:21:42] <thomasgriffin> e.g. var dash = '-'; dash++ would give me '--', and so on and so forth
[19:30:59] <hola> doubt it, but could probably use whatever the string append command is in jquery? something like dash += '-';
[19:31:15] <fris> .append()
[19:34:45] <bubu> anyone familiar with using the jquery-ui tabs? specifically, loading tabs via the AJAX method?
[19:35:09] <hola> Can someone tell me how to fix this so it will get the window size on load? http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/ycUB6/670/
[19:36:08] <DeltaHeavy> What's executed first in jQuery's AJAX? .always or .done?
[19:43:02] <someguy247832483> does anyone know where a 1.8 compatible version of themeroller is? the latest version has no legacy option when downloading.
[20:48:46] <Angryasian> sup
[21:31:19] <clu3> Hello jquery, i'm looking for a plugin that makes the post's title sticky when the page is scrolling like what's in http://9gag.com/ but i haven't been able to find one, any suggesttions?
[21:35:30] <thomasgriffin> I'm stumped - this recursive function doesn't work on nested ul's and I don't know why - any insights? https://gist.github.com/9715168bbf627d93e812
[21:36:43] <thomasgriffin> I'm left with undefined for the nested items
[21:37:05] <robgleeson> anyone know why .autocomplete() wouldn't work on elements added dynamically to the page?
[21:37:23] <robgleeson> it works if (at page load) I select them all but adding them dynmaically doesn't work.
[21:37:31] <robgleeson> really appreciate some feedback/thoughts. thx!
[22:11:00] <Cork> robgleeson: you need to run it on each element after you've added it
[22:12:16] <Cork> thomasgriffin: $('#site-navigation').each(function(i, el){ is really weird, as that can ever only give you one element, why are you using each?
[22:12:58] <Cork> thomasgriffin: if you could provide the html structure it would be easier to follow the code
[22:22:12] <samaritan> Just wondering, how many of you would be interested in replacing .hide functionality with something like $("#notes-0").fadeTo(5000,0.00000000000000000001, function() { $("#notes-0").slideUp(300);} );
[22:23:14] <robgleeson> Cork: I do.
[22:26:34] <Cork> robgleeson: would have to see the code to tell what happens then
[22:26:55] <couchand> samaritan: why not chain those? $("#notes-0").fadeTo( verySlow, transparent ).slideUp( prettyQuick );
[22:29:13] <samaritan> chains happen parallelly. I want the slideup to happen after it has faded
[22:30:04] <samaritan> I'm pretty sure many others would as well :/ That's I'm here, to see how many feel the same.
[22:30:37] <Cork> samaritan: you need to listen for the callback
[22:52:50] <gabrieluk> if i use this guide, am i going wrong? it is outdated, v1.4.2,  http://woorkup.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/jQuery-Visual-Cheat-Sheet-1.4.2.pdf
[22:52:52] <ryanneufeld> samaritan: see ?hide
[22:52:53] <bot-t> samaritan, .hide(): Hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[22:53:32] <ryanneufeld> gabrieluk: most of that stuff should be okay, but you can always use api.jquery.com
[22:53:52] <gabrieluk> mm, nice.
[22:55:03] <gabrieluk> i really want to get on  with jquery, i'm very bored with css and design overall
[22:57:48] <gabrieluk> ryanneufeld, i like to learn by example. would you point me some stuff, other than tuts and api so i can get some ideas?
[22:58:13] <gabrieluk> i have a good state with oop vanilla js
[22:58:45] <gabrieluk> i was doing that codecademy
[22:59:19] <gabrieluk> i use many plugins, but i want to write custom code, i just dk where to start
[23:00:45] <coldhead> at the top of the file, with $(document).ready()
[23:01:51] <gabrieluk> haha, nice one  :P
[23:28:05] <letweet> Hi! So, I have an value tucked away in an asp.net GridView DataRow that I need to use to make a context menu for each row work... the span for the label renders with an id of ... ContentPlaceHolder1_gvItems_lblMailId_0 where the 0 at the end is dynamic for every row (increments 0, 1, 2, 3, etc) ... how can I reference this control to get it's text value in jquery?
[23:28:24] <noregret> is it possible to use the ui spinner sideways ? like for using in pagination.. ?
[23:40:07] <anli> Why is http://jsfiddle.net/ad7PW/ failing to find the test function?
[23:41:21] <anli> Trying again, not sure that my posting went through because of freenode authentication
[23:41:29] <anli> Why is http://jsfiddle.net/ad7PW/ failing to find the test function?
[23:42:35] <Cork> anli: cause your defining inside a onload event handler
[23:42:56] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ad7PW/1/
[23:43:06] <anli> Ah, thanks!
[23:43:17] <Cork> (and again thats a reason why you shouldn't use inline event handlers)
[23:43:34] <Cork> s/handlers/event attributes/
[23:43:58] <anli> So, why isnt the styles set correctly in http://jsfiddle.net/ad7PW/1/ ?
[23:44:18] <anli> Checking with F12 reveals that a " is inserted in the style
[23:44:40] <Cork> causre your setting attributes not style
[23:44:56] <anli> Ah, I have to use style: then
[23:45:06] <Cork> you should be using .css
[23:45:19] <anli> Strange, because I can actually read style=" in F12
[23:45:31] <anli> Seems like jquery really tries to convert to style if appropriate
[23:46:12] <Cork> its just that width and height was a valid attribute before
[23:46:33] <Cork> but its highly recommended not to use, so jquery has special code to move them
[23:46:39] <anli> But they still went into the style attribute
[23:46:47] <Cork> thats what i just said
[23:46:58] <anli> http://jsfiddle.net/ad7PW/2/ is the correct version, it seems
[23:47:00] <anli> Not that pretty
[23:47:09] <Cork> ...
[23:47:13] <anli> I may use div.css after the construction instead
[23:47:15] <Cork> ok, don't listen then...
[23:47:20] <anli> Sorry
[23:53:05] <angryasian> lol
[23:59:32] <angryasian> http://jsfiddle.net/ad7PW/4/
[23:59:36] <angryasian> much nicer and neater
