[00:30:23] <pokmo> hi
[00:30:35] <pokmo> on safari, does $.ajax eventually call XHR.open()?
[00:33:50] <pokmo> i've tried overriding XHR.open() and calling $.ajax() but it doesn't break inside the overriding open()
[00:37:17] <naresh> Hi, Good Morning, When i am submitting a form getting below error - "Uncaught ReferenceError: clearErrorMessagesCSS is not defined"
[00:37:24] <naresh> Could please some body help me
[00:44:31] <Woet> Guest96935: what do you think that message means?
[00:44:58] <Woet> pokmo: why are you overriding it? what are you trying to do?
[00:45:16] <pokmo> Woet i'm writing a greasymonkey script
[00:46:04] <Woet> pokmo: same questions
[00:47:15] <pokmo> does $.ajax behave differently on Safari?
[00:47:29] <pokmo> Woet i'm just writing a greasymonkey script that overrides XHR.open
[00:47:41] <pokmo> it works perfectly on Chrome/Firefox
[00:49:35] <pokmo> even a simple check on console shows that it performs quite differently
[00:49:59] <pokmo> https://dpaste.de/RY9Q
[00:50:15] <pokmo> it prints in chrome/firefox but not in safari
[01:11:34] <Cork> pokmo: it might not be more complicated then nitro not allowing to extend that object
[01:12:12] <Cork> pokmo: as jquery doesn't do any ajax difference now days (1.x does but not 2 or 3)
[02:07:15] <pokmo> Cork oh
[02:10:14] <pokmo> Cork so in 2 and 3, builtin functions can't be overridden?
[02:10:40] <Cork> no, not at all what i said
[02:11:00] <Cork> i said jquery doesn't have browser differentials in 2 and 3
[02:11:14] <pokmo> oooh
[02:11:26] <Cork> what you are doing is overriding a default property of a browser built in object
[02:11:32] <Cork> those are sometimes frozen
[02:11:44] <Cork> and they do sometimes differ between browsers
[02:12:19] <Cork> so your replacing of the open property might not get stored/accepted at all in nitro (safari) and that is why you aren't seeing the call
[02:12:36] <Cork> i can't say for sure cause i have close to no experience with the innings of safari
[02:12:51] <pokmo> hmm
[02:13:03] <robertmaxrees> but you don't want to modify global objects you don't own.
[02:13:05] <Cork> so i am not up to date with what quirks they have
[02:13:24] <Cork> ya, that is normally a good principle
[02:13:29] <Cork> though sometimes you don't have a choice
[02:13:52] <Cork> but you should be EXTREAMLY careful if you choose to do so
[02:14:02] <pokmo> sure, i'm trying to hijack XHR.open
[02:14:04] <robertmaxrees> ^ 9/10 if you think you need to, you don't ;)
[02:14:07] <robertmaxrees> why?
[02:14:14] <pokmo> to by pass this ad network
[02:14:21] <pokmo> it's a greasymonkey script
[02:14:40] <Cork> pokmo: is the script you're trying to modify use xhr directly or jquery?
[02:14:54] <pokmo> Cork it's using XHR.open and XHR.send directly
[02:15:08] <Cork> ya... then you might be out of luck
[02:15:17] <robertmaxrees> pokmo "by pass this ad network"?
[02:15:26] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify?
[02:15:47] <pokmo> robertmaxrees ok. basically a token is issued, but it's validated only if an ad is loaded
[02:15:49] <Cork> robertmaxrees: i suspect it is something like a bypase the page so it doesn't do things you don't want it to do
[02:16:06] <pokmo> and this ad is generated using this .js which is already blocked by most adblockers
[02:16:22] <Cork> pokmo: have you tried using a proxy?
[02:16:29] <Cork> (and i don't mean a network proxy here)
[02:16:33] <pokmo> the way it now does it is to make a request to a php on its own server and redirect it to that .js
[02:17:18] <pokmo> if that .js is blocked, their end knows it failed and the token won't get validated
[02:17:45] <pokmo> Cork a debugging proxy? i don't think it helps
[02:17:49] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy
[02:17:52] <Cork> no not a debugging proxy
[02:18:13] <Cork> proxy is a javascript native explicitly added to allow third party to modify values for objects
[02:18:25] <robertmaxrees> you aren't trying to, like, simulate that the ad loaded anyway, right?
[02:18:35] <pokmo> my script works fine on chrome and firefox
[02:18:44] <Cork> i suspect that is exactly what he is trying to do
[02:18:58] <pokmo> ^
[02:19:07] <robertmaxrees> so you get paid even if an ad blocker was used?
[02:19:13] <pokmo> paid?
[02:19:23] <pokmo> well, the ad won't get loaded
[02:19:28] <robertmaxrees> why do you want to simulate that the ad got loaded?
[02:19:29] <pokmo> it's to fake the loading
[02:19:31] <Woet> ah, that's why he refused to tell me what he was trying to do
[02:19:34] <Woet> because it's immoral
[02:19:43] <pokmo> Woet because it's a long story!
[02:19:51] <robertmaxrees> pokmo it's also illegal heh
[02:19:54] <Woet> just the tldr of "im trying to screw other people over" is good enough
[02:20:03] <pokmo> robertmaxrees that's the only way to have the token validated
[02:20:09] <pokmo> without actually loading/rendering the ad
[02:20:15] <robertmaxrees> pokmo right.
[02:20:20] <pokmo> well
[02:20:22] <robertmaxrees> if the ad didn't load, it shouldn't validate.
[02:20:41] <robertmaxrees> that's *by design*
[02:21:08] <robertmaxrees> bypassing that is a really bad idea.
[02:21:18] <pokmo> Woet it's no more immoral than adblockers are
[02:21:25] <Woet> pokmo: correct.
[02:21:26] <pokmo> robertmaxrees why
[02:21:51] <Woet> pokmo: do you use that argument in court too? "it's no more immoral than murder so let me go"
[02:22:13] <robertmaxrees> pokmo because you, as a publisher, signed a TOS that said you wouldn't defraud the company.
[02:22:26] <robertmaxrees> what you're doing actually costs somebody else money.
[02:22:31] <Woet> pokmo: people are paying to have their banner shown, stop scamming thm
[02:22:32] <Woet> them *
[02:22:34] <robertmaxrees> at least ad blockers don't have that problem.
[02:22:38] <robertmaxrees> ^
[02:22:50] <robertmaxrees> you're screwing over the companies paying for the ad.
[02:22:59] <Woet> so yea, it's actually more immoral than adblockers
[02:23:01] <pokmo> Woet let's try 'it's no more immoral than driving 40 in a 60 zone'
[02:23:10] <Woet> because you're doing the same and then charging the advertiser on top of it
[02:23:19] <Robdgreat> who are you cheating out of money by driving 40 in a 60?
[02:23:20] <pokmo> charging?
[02:23:27] <pokmo> Woet why would the advertiser be charged
[02:23:30] <robertmaxrees> right, and then getting paid for a service you never actually provided.
[02:23:31] <robertmaxrees> ....
[02:23:32] <pokmo> the ads aren't even loaded
[02:23:34] <Woet> lmao
[02:23:38] <Cork> pokmo: if the ad network is getting notified you're doing this; you will be blocked from the network completely
[02:23:40] <robertmaxrees> pokmo you're simulating that the ads DID get lkoaded.
[02:23:49] <robertmaxrees> how do you think they then pay you?
[02:23:49] <Cork> do you really see that risk as worth it?
[02:23:55] <Woet> pokmo: why do you want this "token" validated?
[02:24:03] <robertmaxrees> ^
[02:24:06] <pokmo> Woet because i'm a regular on the site
[02:24:09] <pokmo> and the ads are pissing me off
[02:24:19] <Cork> <_<'
[02:24:25] <robertmaxrees> pokmo then just display: none; on the containers and call it a day.
[02:24:26] <Woet> pokmo: that doesn't answer my question
[02:24:29] <Woet> pokmo: why do you want this "token" validated?
[02:24:33] <Cork> so you're screwing off the site and you don't even own it...
[02:24:35] <Robdgreat> oh, this guy
[02:24:39] <pokmo> robertmaxrees can't. they've got measures to counter 'hiddens'
[02:24:48] <Robdgreat> wants to get around anti-ad-blockers
[02:24:49] <robertmaxrees> pokmo then give up and let the site get paid.
[02:24:54] <pokmo> Woet because it's needed to load the content
[02:24:59] <Woet> pokmo: perhaps you should not use a site if you don't like it?
[02:25:00] <robertmaxrees> hah
[02:25:08] <Robdgreat> I believe someone told you this last time
[02:25:10] <Robdgreat> what Woet said
[02:25:34] <Woet> pokmo: or maybe send them a message saying "hey i love your site but hate the ads, can i donate some money for an ad-free membership?"
[02:25:40] <robertmaxrees> ^
[02:26:02] <pokmo> that's boring
[02:26:07] <Robdgreat> wtf
[02:26:19] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[02:26:30] <robertmaxrees> it's The Right Thing™
[02:26:53] <pokmo> by this standard, none of you guys use an adblocker then?
[02:27:03] <Woet> correct
[02:27:24] <pokmo> good for you!
[02:27:48] <Woet> but the ads annoy me, so i sign up for things like youtube red / twitch prime / etc.
[02:28:28] <Woet> and if a sites ad usage bothers me, i find a different site
[02:28:59] <Woet> which site is this about? i'm curious how they implemented it
[02:29:16] <Robdgreat> I use an adblocker but I turn it off for sites with normal ads that don't go out of their way to create a worse experience for me
[02:29:33] <pokmo> Robdgreat these are not normal ads
[02:29:39] <pokmo> these are mp4s that blink
[02:29:47] <pokmo> anyway
[02:30:31] <pokmo> Woet they just run a script that checks for hidden DOM elements, count their iframes
[02:30:43] <Woet> why is it so difficult to answer questions
[02:30:47] <Woet> which site is this about?
[02:31:29] <Robdgreat> inb4 sooper sekrit
[02:31:29] <robertmaxrees> pokmo also: why are you trying to make it work cross-browser?  planning on distributing it?
[02:31:52] <Woet> robertmaxrees: gotta scale the ripping off people
[02:32:18] <pokmo> Woet i'd prefer not to be so specific
[02:32:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[02:32:22] <pokmo> robertmaxrees because i'm a safari user
[02:32:31] <Robdgreat> Woet: called it
[02:32:35] <Woet> why? you have nothing to hide?
[02:33:30] <Robdgreat> Your best above-board means of doing something about this is to promote a boycott of the site.
[02:33:51] <Robdgreat> surely you're not the only one troubled by these ads
[02:33:56] <Robdgreat> shouldn't be too difficult
[02:34:08] <undefined_bob> good morning
[02:35:03] <Robdgreat> maybe get the epilepsy foundation involved
[02:35:52] <robertmaxrees> basically, don't try to skirt the ads.  find a less shady way to get what you want.
[04:22:49] <thykka> > robertmaxrees pokmo it's also illegal heh
[04:22:52] <thykka> [citation needed]
[04:26:12] <thykka> and when was the last time advertisers paid the people who own the platforms their ads are displayed on?
[09:14:35] <anddam> hello
[09:14:52] <anddam> why are there no 2.x releases at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/releases ?
[09:16:10] <Cork> anddam: cause nothing was depricated between 1.x and 2.x
[09:16:21] <Cork> 2.x just removed compatibility with old ie browsers
[09:17:09] <Cork> (so 2.x is drop in compatible with 1.x as long as you don't need ie8 or older)
[09:17:26] <anddam> Cork: I don't follow, the fact that nothing was deprecated means that just leaving latest 2.x would have been fine, not the opposite
[09:17:47] <Cork> anddam: uh, not sure what you mean
[09:18:05] <Cork> 2.0 is a match for 1.10, 2.1 with 1.11 and so on
[09:20:10] <Cork> and 1.x is not a deprecated branch it lives along side 2 and 3; where 1.x and 2.x is release synced
[09:36:15] <KnightsOfNi> Anyone can think of a reason why .focus() on a textarea only works 'sometimes'? It's in a textarea in a bs4 modal
[09:36:42] <KnightsOfNi> I load content with ajax in the  modal and in the success callback I do a focus on the textarea that is in the modal content
[09:36:50] <KnightsOfNi> sometimes it's focused, sometimes it's not
[09:37:20] <Cork> not straight of my head no
[09:37:32] <Cork> possibly the selector you use match more then one element?
[09:48:08] <KnightsOfNi> @cork: I use the first() method: $('.modal').find('textarea').first().focus();
[09:48:44] <Cork> have you verified $().find() always find something?
[09:48:52] <Cork> (and only 1 thing)
[09:50:18] <anddam> Cork: I'm not sure to understand what you're saying either. I see historically there have been 2.x.y releases, my question is why github project's release page doesn't list any of them
[09:51:15] <Cork> anddam: 1.0 to 1.9 is re 2.x, 1.10 was released the same time as 2.0 and those have the exact same method compatibility
[09:51:32] <Cork> 1.11 and 2.1 came later and 1.12 and 2.2 and so on
[09:51:44] <Cork> those have the same api; no different at all
[09:51:52] <Cork> it if works with one it would work with the other
[09:52:13] <Cork> so there are no 2.x migration releases, as there are no 2.x migrations
[09:54:31] <KnightsOfNi> Cork, when I put .length after first(), it's always 1
[09:54:40] <Cork> remove .first()
[09:54:59] <Cork> basically what you want to know if you are possibly matching something you are not expecting
[09:55:03] <Cork> and targeting the wrong place
[09:56:47] <KnightsOfNi> Euh, is it possible that it's fixed now by removing the first() ?
[09:57:08] <KnightsOfNi> It's focused now everytime
[09:57:17] <Cork> no, i meant console.log($().find().length)
[09:57:31] <KnightsOfNi> yes I'll try that
[09:57:34] <Cork> if that is ever something other then 1 you have a risk that your targeting the wrong element
[09:57:58] <Cork> (element order meaning first isn't always the first)
[09:58:12] <Cork> or rather isn't always the correct first :)
[09:58:45] <KnightsOfNi> Ok it's not working, stubmled across one that was not focused, and the length was 1 (console.log($('.modal').find('textarea').length);)
[09:59:15] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: so you ran .focus and that line at the same place?
[09:59:25] <Cork> meaning in the same function after each other?
[09:59:39] <KnightsOfNi> Let  me paste the method
[09:59:58] <KnightsOfNi> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/214e58e1a2a14ff673bfbd8b3a848de1
[10:00:48] <Cork> doesn't showModal give you the modal you work with as this?
[10:01:00] <Cork> that code seams very leaky to me...
[10:01:38] <KnightsOfNi> leaky?
[10:01:39] <Cork> (btw you should always have preventDefault as the first action in a handler, not the last)
[10:01:54] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: if there is every another .modal in the page you will target the wrong place
[10:01:57] <KnightsOfNi> Here is the showModal method: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4e8541b1568a598a5831abb7115da619
[10:02:11] <Cork> $(this).find('textarea') is what i would expect should work there
[10:02:23] <KnightsOfNi> as the first action? I always see people put it at the end
[10:02:25] <KnightsOfNi> :|
[10:02:30] <Cork> though i donno what showModal provides
[10:02:46] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: no, that is where ppl put the old return value
[10:02:53] <Cork> preventDefault should always be first
[10:03:09] <KnightsOfNi> Ok I will change that
[10:03:55] <KnightsOfNi> Cork, I need that showModal sitewide
[10:04:10] <Cork> donno what you mean
[10:04:30] <Cork> if you run $('.modal') your targeting the entire page what ever exist anywhere
[10:04:44] <Cork> meaning if the entire page isn't aware of this code the page will break
[10:05:05] <KnightsOfNi> but that .modal tag always exists
[10:05:18] <Cork> ya, but your inverting the problem
[10:05:27] <KnightsOfNi> how should it be then?
[10:05:27] <Cork> it there ever exists another .modal in the page
[10:05:31] <Cork> this code will break
[10:05:41] <KnightsOfNi> should I use an ID then?
[10:05:42] <Cork> cause it leaks with it selector for
[10:05:51] <Cork> do you have the code for showModal?
[10:06:01] <KnightsOfNi> Yes I pasted it ^
[10:06:10] <Cork> oh missed it :x
[10:06:21] <KnightsOfNi> It's a dodgy function
[10:07:12] <Cork> uh, wait is $modalContent a global??
[10:07:39] <KnightsOfNi> yes like this:  let $modalContent = $('#modal-content'),
[10:07:51] <KnightsOfNi> well it's in my init.js
[10:07:54] <Cork> that isn't by definition a global
[10:08:05] <Cork> but it sounds like it isn't
[10:08:25] <Cork> then do callback.call($modalContact[0]) instead of callback()
[10:08:49] <Cork> then you can do $(this).find('textarea') in the callback and always know you target the inside of the modal
[10:09:11] <Cork> you can also possibly use $modalContantBody[0], depends on what you want to provide as the element for the callback
[10:10:21] <KnightsOfNi> interesting
[10:10:39] <KnightsOfNi> But what is this " $modalContact[0] "
[10:10:40] <KnightsOfNi> ?
[10:10:59] <Cork> it unwrapps the jquery object and gives you the raw dom element
[10:10:59] <KnightsOfNi> $modalContent you mean?
[10:11:11] <Cork> Content not Contact ya XD
[10:11:19] <Cork> but [0] is neede
[10:11:24] <Cork> +d
[10:11:39] <KnightsOfNi> [0] gives you vanilla js, :o
[10:11:47] <Cork> unwrapped dom element
[10:11:52] <Cork> jquery is vanilla js
[10:12:01] <Cork> so there is no none vanilla :)
[10:12:04] <KnightsOfNi> just a string then?
[10:12:08] <Cork> dom element
[10:12:17] <Cork> i'm not talking about html here
[10:12:19] <Cork> but the dom
[10:12:52] <KnightsOfNi> oh so you can do $modalContent[0].classList
[10:12:57] <Cork> yes
[10:13:21] <Cork> and as callbacks in jquery is always the raw dom element i suggested you did .call([0])
[10:13:36] <KnightsOfNi> I don't understand how jquery is vanilla js, surely the code of jquery is vanilla js, but people using jquery functions are not doing vanilla js
[10:13:37] <Cork> else this would be a jquery object in the callback and that is weird
[10:13:38] <KnightsOfNi> ?
[10:13:47] <Cork> they are
[10:13:58] <Cork> jquery isn't a language, it is a helper framework
[10:14:25] <Cork> coffiescript, typescript and things like that is not vanilla js
[10:14:35] <KnightsOfNi> oohh
[10:14:41] <Cork> dart is another example
[10:14:53] <KnightsOfNi> oh yeah, because that has to be compiled to js
[10:14:58] <Cork> yes
[10:15:00] <KnightsOfNi> and jquery doesnt
[10:15:08] <Cork> it changes the parser
[10:15:23] <Cork> jquery just provides a set of helper functions; nothing else
[10:15:42] <Cork> (a very good set, don't get me wrong :))
[10:16:54] <KnightsOfNi> You sound like you're part of the jquery team;p
[10:17:00] <Cork> na
[10:20:20] <syad80> hi, why does the last FIND work but not the second $(".panel.panel-default.form-section").has("div[aria-labelledby=\"section_head_Dettaglio11\"]").find("[id^='saveLink8']").click(function() {          and this doesnt:  $(".panel.panel-default.form-section").has("div[aria-labelledby=\"section_head_Dettaglio11\"]").find("[id^='saveLink']").click(function() { , I
[10:20:46] <Cork> syad80: please provide a jsfiddle
[10:21:04] <Cork> don't page large blobs of code in the channel
[10:21:07] <Cork> noone can read it anyway
[10:24:56] <stephenplatz> In jQuery UI 1.10.2, for dialog widgets, the default close button (x icon) has a click handler that calls (among other functions) t.stopImmediatePropagation(). I think that that I causing some other functions to stop working after it's clicked. Anyone else seen similar? Is that necessary to call on click?
[10:25:31] <Cork> hmm, never seen it called before
[10:25:40] <Cork> and no i would call that bad behaviour
[10:25:59] <stephenplatz> That's what I thought. How can I override it?
[10:26:26] <Cork> hmm it is done by the ui.mouse widget...
[10:26:34] <Cork> well ya, it does a lot of horrible things...
[10:26:46] <Cork> stephenplatz: you can bind the close event on the dialog widget
[10:26:51] <Cork> i would recommend going that way
[10:27:07] <Cork> unless you want to monkey patch ui.mouse
[10:28:56] <stephenplatz> Cork: That's kind of how I discovered this issue, I have set in the dialog options a simple self.close() on the overlay, which doesn't break anything. So, I'm dealing with some default behavior here, I'd like to have it just close, but it's stopping immediate propagation etc.
[10:29:35] <Cork> stephenplatz: you can enable that directly in the dialog config if i remember correctly
[10:29:36] <stephenplatz> This is actually in ui.button, BTQ
[10:29:38] <stephenplatz> BTW
[10:30:03] <Cork> no, the only call to stopImidiatePropagation in the ui source is in ui.mouse
[10:31:37] <Cork> hmm, i remembered wrong about the option though
[10:33:11] <stephenplatz> Cork: When I pretty print jquery.ui.button.min.js in the inspector, line 56 has .bind('click' + this.eventNamespace, function (t) {r.disabled && (t.preventDefault(), t.stopImmediatePropagation())
[10:33:57] <stephenplatz> Yeah, there is a close method and event, but neither will help with config, I think
[10:38:35] <stephenplatz> Anyway, I may have to come back to this, time to get my daughter to school.
[10:49:01] <Buoy172> Can I detect android back button on a webpage?
[10:50:16] <Buoy172> I have a popup menu which is a fixed <div> and I want to hide it instead of go-to-previous-page if the user clicks the back button
[10:53:19] <thykka> that would be the wrong approach
[10:53:52] <thykka> Buoy172, you'll want to use the history API https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History
[10:54:38] <thykka> Buoy172, specifically, this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API#Adding_and_modifying_history_entries
[11:24:43] <KnightsOfNi> @cork: reason that textarea wasn't getting focused is because bootstrap triggers a focus on the modal by default
[12:28:53] <maggusFFM> hey guys! nice to meet you in here. great channel =))
[12:31:26] <maggusFFM> i have a problem with dss. i made a style.css.php file and i linked it in wp header.php. works fine. i want to change an element inline so far this dss solution doesnt work fine. so i came up do jquery. how can read a proberty of an element inline and change it? f. eg <div id="box1"><div id="box2"></div></div>
[12:31:51] <maggusFFM> can i do such a thing with jquery?
[12:32:05] <maggusFFM> has anybode a tutorial or can help me ? pm pls
[12:35:56] <thykka> maggusFFM, by "dss", you mean CSS?
[12:36:49] <maggusFFM> dynamicly yes: file.css.php
[12:36:54] <thykka> and what exactly did you want to change, and why?
[12:36:57] <maggusFFM> but i didtn get it to work
[12:37:11] <maggusFFM> i want to change the background dynamicly
[12:37:17] <maggusFFM> with a custom field
[12:37:37] <maggusFFM> like: custombg(kez) = yellow (value)
[12:37:50] <maggusFFM> i made 7 versions now and i dont get it to work
[12:38:36] <maggusFFM> i hav a gallerybox system and the background there)it has an id) should dynamicly changed with the value of the custom field
[12:39:08] <thykka> instead of a .css.php, you could simply echo a <style> block on the page. To be able to set it with jQuery, you'd need to make the custom field's value available to the frontend, somehow
[12:39:18] <thykka> there are plenty of ways, really
[12:39:44] <maggusFFM> yes i could imagin.. iam a very beginnerlevel and somhow new to jq
[12:40:34] <maggusFFM> with this i can read the value:
[12:40:36] -maggusFFM- <?php global $wp_query;$postid = $wp_query->post->ID;
[12:40:36] -maggusFFM- echo get_post_meta($postid, 'custombg', true); ?>
[12:40:55] <maggusFFM> so this gives me the color yellow
[12:41:13] <maggusFFM> how can i get it bounced to an div elements id style?
[12:41:17] <thykka> and what outputs the element you want to change?
[12:41:44] <maggusFFM> for every article there is another color in the custom field
[12:42:18] <maggusFFM> and this div with id "box2" should change dynacly
[12:42:22] <maggusFFM> dynamicly
[12:42:33] <maggusFFM> its background
[12:42:37] <maggusFFM> nothing else
[12:42:43] <thykka> the smart way to go about this would be to add a class to the relevant element via PHP. The fast way to go about this would be to add the color as an inline style to that element, and the worst way would be to use jQuery ;)
[12:43:06] <maggusFFM> ^^
[12:43:56] <thykka> soo.. maybe you could first make up some classes out of the custom field's value, "background--yellow" for instance
[12:44:39] <maggusFFM> how can i do this? or what do u mean?
[12:45:00] <maggusFFM> should i give it out in the parser? and make a div out of it?
[12:45:38] <tilerendering> anybody using i18next here?
[12:46:15] <thykka> maggusFFM, as an example; $background_class = 'background--' . get_post_meta($post, 'custombg', true); // this would set $background_class === 'background--yellow', if the custom meta is 'yellow'
[12:46:47] <thykka> maggusFFM, you could then use this to insert $background_class into <body> https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/body_class/
[12:47:18] <maggusFFM> sounds great i will tst and read this first
[12:47:21] <thykka> then, in your (normal) CSS, you could have some new rules, like .background--yellow .my-element { background-color: yellow; }
[12:47:32] <thykka> and that should pretty much do it
[12:47:44] <maggusFFM> do i need the rules in css?
[12:47:54] <thykka> yes
[12:47:57] <thykka> or no
[12:48:05] <thykka> you don't *need* them, but it's the smart way to go about this
[12:48:19] <thykka> because then you can add additional changes to the layout later, if needed
[12:48:29] <maggusFFM> because if there stands yellow and an article has the customfield pink, does it then take the pink instead of the yellow?
[12:48:31] <thykka> perhaps you also want white text if the background is black
[12:48:47] <thykka> maggusFFM, only if body has *both* of the new classes, which shouldn't happen
[12:49:00] <thykka> wait what
[12:49:24] <thykka> yeah no, the yellow would be ignored in that case, because the element would not match the .background--yellow CSS selector
[12:49:34] <thykka> but .background--pink instead
[12:50:07] <maggusFFM> should i write a function in the function.php file?
[12:50:20] <thykka> most likely, yes
[12:50:20] <maggusFFM> or at the footer.php?
[12:51:28] <thykka> kinda depends on how the plugin/theme is organised, but usually functions.php
[12:52:48] <thykka> so yeah, make a function that returns a classname based on the current post's custom field value, then call that function within header.php, like so: <body <?php body_class( maggusFFM_get_background_class(); ?>>
[12:52:54] <thykka> (or whatever your function is called)
[12:53:40] <thykka> maggusFFM, I gotta go now, but if there are problems, better ask in #wordpress
[12:53:42] <thykka> good luck!
[12:54:00] <maggusFFM> thank u so much
[12:54:05] <maggusFFM> i try this
[12:56:34] <maggusFFM> this changes the body or? i need to change a special div called by id="box2"
[15:52:10] <mrush> lets say i have a four-thousand line text file
[15:53:32] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[15:53:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:53:45] <mrush> if i want to display it in columns, is the conventional way to do so, by using jquery to break the text up into suitably sized pieces per column, or is there a more programatic way
[15:53:48] <mrush> :)
[15:53:55] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:54:16] <mrush> man, i really stuttered that out badly
[15:54:16] <robertmaxrees> "suitably sized pieces per column"
[15:54:25] <mrush> lemme try one more time
[15:54:27] <robertmaxrees> are we talkin' some kind of delimited file?
[15:54:36] <robertmaxrees> got an example of the text file in question?
[15:54:53] <mrush> not delimited, like if i have an article written in plain text
[15:55:05] <robertmaxrees> and you want to display it in columns?
[15:55:05] <mrush> i basically want to pour that into columns
[15:55:29] <robertmaxrees> so lemme ask the next question: why?
[15:55:35] <mrush> mhm. and my question is, do i have to hard-code a per-column chunk size
[15:56:13] <mrush> oh, i'm just trying to learn how to cram content into various layouts
[15:56:21] <robertmaxrees> https://css-tricks.com/guide-responsive-friendly-css-columns/
[15:56:27] <robertmaxrees> this where you want to start.
[15:56:47] <robertmaxrees> but I'd argue that multi-column text articles are generally a Bad Idea™
[15:57:28] <mrush> thanks robertmaxrees. ok, i'll not do it in that case
[15:57:32] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:57:34] <mrush> thank you sir :)
[15:57:37] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason sites don't use it :)
[15:57:44] <robertmaxrees> readability nightmare.
[15:58:24] <mrush> i can see why. but, lets say it's not a text file but a bunch of records of json data
[15:58:47] <mrush> and i want to display it spread out across n columns
[15:59:35] <mrush> it guess i'd have to hard code a max-height per column?
[15:59:49] <mrush> (thanks for the link)
[16:02:36] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:02:42] <robertmaxrees> so back WAAAAAY up
[16:02:50] <mrush> lol ok
[16:03:09] <robertmaxrees> so "formatting text" is distinct from "formatting data"
[16:03:22] <mrush> alright
[16:03:28] <robertmaxrees> like, are you trying to display the JSON is a presentable way.
[16:03:56] <mrush> yes, like, each record is wrapped in a div with certain classes, etc
[16:04:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you can use that CSS column stuff up above for that, but there are a ton of other ways to do it.
[16:04:21] <mrush> the data is populated into html attributes
[16:05:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:05:07] <robertmaxrees> you're not, like, creating attributes, right?
[16:05:13] <mrush> no
[16:06:39] <mrush> for example <div id="' +data.id+ '" class="' +data.classes+ '">' +data.text+ '</div>
[16:06:50] <mrush> is that crazy?
[16:07:10] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[16:07:14] <mrush> k
[16:07:23] <robertmaxrees> though I'd look into using a templating engine instead.
[16:07:35] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, you're basically trying to use a grid.
[16:08:28] <mrush> you said there are a ton of ways-- okay, but jquery doesnt have methods for any sort of templating level of abstraction, right?
[16:08:56] <mrush> so i'd be looking for another library, right?
[16:08:59] <robertmaxrees> "a ton of ways" was in reference to handling that layout.
[16:09:04] <mrush> np
[16:09:09] <robertmaxrees> but you don't really need anmother lib.
[16:09:12] <robertmaxrees> you can easily write that.
[16:09:16] <riskish> Can someone show me how to run myFunction() code when the vote.png image is clicked? https://jsfiddle.net/fvj6e3gp/2/
[16:09:43] <mrush> ok, cool. thanks for your input :) i thought i was finally losing it for a second
[16:10:15] <robertmaxrees> riskish are you using jquery or no?
[16:10:40] <robertmaxrees> also: <input type="image" src="vote.png" alt="Submit Form" /> wat
[16:10:51] <riskish> err
[16:10:54] <riskish> hold on
[16:11:12] <robertmaxrees> trying to make a graphical submit button?
[16:11:25] <riskish> https://jsfiddle.net/fvj6e3gp/3/
[16:11:26] <riskish> yes
[16:11:37] <robertmaxrees> so first of all
[16:11:37] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/fvj6e3gp/4/
[16:11:43] <robertmaxrees> that's literally all your fiddle needs :)
[16:11:57] <robertmaxrees> you're just asking about the image and the function, right?
[16:12:04] <riskish> yes
[16:12:16] <robertmaxrees> next: api.jquery.com/on/
[16:12:17] <robertmaxrees> you want this.
[16:21:30] <riskish> does that allow me to add an eventlister?
[16:28:41] <robertmaxrees> riskish if you look at http://api.jquery.com/on/, one of the first things you see is "Description: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements."
[16:28:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:31:38] <Neo4> :)
[23:21:25] <sadtaco> I'm trying to find one of those javascript scrollbars that still use native behavior and just listen on scroll to update the bar size and position, but a lot I'm finding are busted. Like they use z-index and such and can really nuke a web app with that.
