[00:00:35] <karstenk1977_> stop? the animation doesn´t start?!
[00:00:46] <djQuery> karstenk1977_, where on the page is that?
[00:00:59] <karstenk1977_> the tiles
[00:01:23] <karstenk1977_> should be open when mouse is over more than 3 seconds
[00:01:39] <Meztek> djquery: the stop is fine where you have it
[00:02:07] <Meztek> djquery: does the class name have a capital "t" ?
[00:02:36] <defaultro> checking djQuery
[00:02:37] <djQuery> Meztek, think you wanna ask karstenk1977_ I was providing him with answers
[00:02:52] <Meztek> oh lol
[00:02:53] <Meztek> sorry
[00:03:14] <djQuery> Meztek, he didn't have a stop before his animation starting
[00:03:22] <defaultro> djQuery, should I try that code?
[00:03:43] <defaultro> or are we going to encounter the same problem?
[00:04:03] <djQuery> defaultro, do you understand after looking at that code when you would want to use e.preventDefault() on a form?
[00:04:33] <defaultro> it stops the bubbling something
[00:04:35] <Meztek> just curious, because the function is not a closure does the 'this' object get passed in?
[00:05:00] <djQuery> defaultro, the only other instance would be if you were gonna use ajax to submit the infor instead of a regular submit
[00:05:23] <defaultro> k
[00:05:49] <djQuery> defaultro, no it doesn't actualy e.stopPropagation does that    see ?stoppropagation
[00:05:50] <bot-t> defaultro, event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[00:05:58] <defaultro> k
[00:06:35] <djQuery> Meztek, i belive so
[00:07:29] <djQuery> defaultro, seems like you need to do a little more reading see ?jqf
[00:07:30] <bot-t> defaultro, jQuery Fundamentals, a free online intro to jQuery - http://jqfundamentals.com
[00:08:40] <defaultro> :)
[00:08:47] <defaultro> thanks for the help!!!
[00:09:01] <defaultro> let me figure this issue first
[00:09:10] <superdo> anyone has problem with jqm data-inline ?
[00:13:09] <topriddy> researching single page applications, and need to choose one framework for a new web project
[00:17:51] <djQuery> superdo, nope I use it
[00:18:42] <superdo> djQuery, I cant make it to work. I added div around anchors, with data-inset true, but no success
[00:18:57] <superdo> i use 1.3.0 and jq latest
[00:23:47] <superdo> djQuery, what jquery version do you use with?
[00:27:15] <Kasimir> topriddy: what do you need on the framework?

[00:32:12] <Kasimir> topriddy: CSS based framework?
[00:33:04] <topriddy> Kasimir: nope. I was talking about Single Page web applications. The available Js libs./framework and the one to choose

[00:40:12] <Kasimir> topriddy: nope, its indipendent... use it alot for projects of mine
[00:40:19] <Kasimir> topriddy: http://www.cappuccino-project.org

[01:31:18] <karstenk1977_> I´m using the extension rgsmoothgallery for this. Cause I´m can choose dam files and dam categorys. Have adding a new style to rgsmoothgallery. But normally rgsmoothgallery returns content with normal html tags, now I have to return a whole xml file insteat
[01:38:17] <jammsen> hey guys, when jquery gets a specific data via $.get i need the users attention, so how can i play a ding or beep sound for that?
[01:38:42] <Cork> jammsen: simplest is prob to use an <audio> tag
[01:39:01] <jammsen> im using xhtml 1.0
[01:39:10] <Cork> with a fallback to <embed>/<object> for older browsers
[01:39:11] <jammsen> i think <audio> isnt implemented there
[01:39:16] <Cork> jammsen: most likely your not
[01:39:30] <Cork> most sites use html with a broken doctype
[01:39:40] <Cork> (when they thing they use xhtml)
[01:39:53] <jammsen> my xhtml 1.0 is valid :)
[01:40:07] <Cork> are your pages sending Content-type: application/xhtml+xml ?
[01:40:09] <jammsen> so im gonna go that far and say its xhtml 1.0 ^^
[01:40:10] <Cork> if not its html
[01:40:27] <Cork> Content-type: application/xhtml+xml is mandatory for xhtml
[01:40:36] <jammsen> ok lets go to the sound
[01:40:37] <Cork> else its just broken html that gets error corrected
[01:40:44] <jammsen> how would i do that?
[01:40:55] <jammsen> is there a jsfiddle or something?
[01:40:58] <Cork> add an <audio> tag that points to a sound file
[01:41:07] <Cork> then grab the element and do .play() on it
[01:41:12] <Cork> (when you want the sound)
[01:41:23] <jammsen> the audio tag has to be where?
[01:41:24] <Cork> ?mdc audio tag
[01:41:27] <jammsen> body?
[01:41:31] <bot-t> Cork, <audio> - HTML | MDN - The HTML <audio> element is used to represents sound content in documents. Added as part of HTML5, it may contain several audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the "><source> elemen... https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/audio
[01:41:31] <Cork> jammsen: anywhere in the body
[01:42:51] <jammsen> but isnt the user seeing the audio tag in the browser?
[01:43:03] <Cork> not unless you set it to have controls
[01:43:18] <Zepo> Hey Guys, so I have this Script where I use a special JQuery Plugin for a dropdown-box, the Problem I have is that the dropdown-box changes it's values with a AJAX-Request, the value's are changed but not the List in the JQuery. So my Question, how do I reload the JQuery-Plugin/Function after the AJAX fired.
[01:44:12] <Cork> Zepo: if you replace the select element with jquery you have to either destroy the replacement object and create a new one
[01:44:22] <Cork> or update the plugin instead of the replaced select element
[01:44:56] <Zepo> Cork: And how do I update the Plugin ?
[01:45:11] <granden> A bit more activity here now. Could someone help me out with a slider? http://jsfiddle.net/7cKLM/4/
[01:45:17] <Cork> look for an add/replace/update or similar function on the plugin
[01:45:42] <Parsi> I have multiple spans with newsbox class name, all them have another child with 'des' class name, i wanna make all 'des's hidden and when mouse hover the newsbox, make it visible
[01:45:46] <jammsen> Cork: how many formats should i put on the server? is wav and ogg enough?
[01:46:13] <Cork> jammsen: ogg and mp3 should cover all browsers that support <audio>
[01:47:42] <Cork> Parsi: .newbox .des { display: none; } .newbox:hover .des { :display: block; }
[01:48:01] <Parsi> ok
[01:48:06] <Zepo> Cork: There are a few functions in the JS but I don't really know how to call them. I am using this plugin ->  https://sourceforge.net/projects/jsearchdropdown/
[01:48:11] <Cork> opps
[01:48:16] <Cork> Parsi: .newbox .des { display: none; } .newbox:hover .des { display: block; }
[01:51:46] <jammsen> Cork: type="audio/mp3" and audio/ogg right?
[01:52:10] <Cork> audio/ogg ya, but i think audio/mp3 is wrong
[01:52:27] <Cork> audio/mpeg3
[01:52:33] <jammsen> you sure?
[01:52:38] <Cork> opps nope
[01:52:41] <Cork> its just  audio/mpeg
[01:52:50] <jammsen> where can i lookup that information?
[01:53:01] <Cork> http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3003
[01:53:03] <Cork> for example
[01:53:19] <Cork> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type is another one
[01:54:02] <jammsen> nice ty
[01:54:21] <reddaemon> i would like to upgrade to query 1.9 and would like to know if query validate is compatible with 1.9
[01:54:23] <Parsi> Cork: nah, i wanna do it with jquery
[01:54:25] <Cork> i usually just google it if i don't know it straight of
[01:54:42] <Parsi> at least showing des
[01:54:43] <reddaemon> I previously tried this and had a bunch of issues
[01:54:52] <reddaemon> so i downgraded to 1.8.3
[01:55:04] <Cork> Parsi: then add a class to the css and add that to the parent with jquery when you want to show the child
[01:55:11] <reddaemon> sorry *jquery validate
[01:55:31] <Cork> reddaemon: you prob need the compatibility plugin
[01:55:53] <reddaemon> is that a jquery plugin?
[01:55:57] <jammsen> so Cork i got the audio tag with id of notfiy sound, no i gonna do my get and when X happens than i just lookup my audiotag with my given id and do $('#notifySound').play(); ?
[01:56:02] <Cork> reddaemon: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate
[01:56:26] <Cork> jammsen: $('#notifySound')[0].play();
[01:56:44] <jammsen> why [0]?
[01:56:55] <Cork> cause play is a dom command
[01:57:00] <Cork> not a jquery one
[01:57:02] <reddaemon> thanks will take a look
[01:57:03] <jammsen> isnt that onyl the first source?
[01:57:07] <jammsen> i got 2 sources
[01:57:20] <Cork> you can't have two sources with the same id
[01:57:26] <Cork> or if you mean <source> that doesn't matter
[01:57:33] <Cork> the browser will use the first one it can decode
[01:57:44] <jammsen> i meant source yeag
[01:57:49] <jammsen> ok ty i will try it
[01:58:09] <Cork> <audio><source><source></audio>
[02:04:11] <Kit-10> granden: ping?
[02:05:17] <granden> Kit-10: Hi :)
[02:06:07] <Kit-10> so did you manage to get your carousel fixed?
[02:06:14] <granden> Havent solved it yet. Got held up by other stuff. Almost forgot it. :)
[02:06:23] <Kit-10> heh
[02:06:34] <Kit-10> might need to repost the link etc
[02:06:39] <Kit-10> but i can try to help
[02:06:51] <granden> I made some small improvements but nothing that acctually solved anything.
[02:06:56] <granden> http://jsfiddle.net/7cKLM/4/
[02:07:00] <granden> There is the latest version.
[02:07:26] <granden> Works great the first time when you press next/prev but its the second time it fucks everything up.
[02:09:56] <granden> ping Kit-10 forgot to mention you. But perhaps you already seen it.
[02:10:06] <Kit-10> :)
[02:10:07] <Kit-10> yep
[02:10:30] <Kit-10> unless there is a lot of channel traffic, hilighting isn't always needed
[02:12:04] <Cork> granden: you didn't state what the problem was before
[02:12:28] <djQuery> granden, works better when you turn off migrate
[02:12:28] <Cork> but .index()<0 and .index()>numOfSliders won't work
[02:13:05] <Cork> first_element.prev() == null (or more exactly $([]) )
[02:13:16] <Cork> same with last_element.next()
[02:13:36] <Cork> you need to check if nextSlide.length > 0
[02:13:54] <Cork> (and always > 0)
[02:14:13] <Cork> as in same for prevSlide.length > 0
[02:14:22] <Parsi> $(".newsBox").hover( function () { //foo }); what if i had multiple .newsbox?
[02:14:46] <Cork> Parsi: you will get one hover event for each of them (if you hover that specific element)
[02:14:50] <djQuery> Parsi, then it would work on any of them
[02:15:18] <granden> Cork, djQuery: Ok, thanks.
[02:16:08] <Parsi> Cork, djQuery, i wanna hide .des inside the active .newsBox, not all them, what should i do?
[02:16:43] <Clex> Parsi: improve your selector.
[02:16:59] <Clex> Which one(s) do you want?
[02:17:13] <djQuery> Parsi, $('.newsBox').on('hover', function(){ $(this).find('.des').hide(); });
[02:18:23] <granden> Cork: I updated according to what you said. And still not works as it should. Works great first time. The second time I press next/prev it got two slides.
[02:18:26] <granden> http://jsfiddle.net/7cKLM/6/
[02:19:00] <djQuery> Parsi, or $('.newsBox').hover( function(){ $(this).find('.des').hide(); }, function(){$(this).find('.des').show();});
[02:19:36] <Cork> granden: looked a bit more, and actually i think from looking at the code, what you want is to use array index instead of dom index (index() and first() last())
[02:20:21] <Cork> granden: store a current = 0; when you start
[02:20:34] <Cork> when you hit next do current++; and pref is current--
[02:20:44] <granden> ok
[02:20:57] <Cork> then hide slides.eq(current-1).hide() slides.eq(current).show()
[02:21:04] <Cork> kinda thing (for next that is)
[02:21:14] <Cork> you would have to handle the current == -1 state though
[02:21:44] <Cork> on the other hand depending on what in the dom would be kinda nice :)
[02:22:02] <granden> Yeah. :)
[02:22:09] <granden> But I dont really mind which.
[02:22:17] <granden> But how would I handle current=-1?
[02:22:24] <granden> current=numOfSlides?
[02:22:48] <Cork> if(current === -1) { current = numOfSlides; }
[02:23:24] <granden> Stupid question probably but why three =?
[02:23:35] <djQuery> if(current ===-1){ current = slides.length; }
[02:23:43] <Cork> ?eval var a = '1'; a == 1
[02:23:47] <bot-t> Cork: true
[02:23:48] <Cork> ?eval var a = '1'; a === 1
[02:23:49] <bot-t> Cork: false
[02:23:54] <Cork> ?eval var a = '1'; a === '1'
[02:23:55] <bot-t> Cork: true
[02:24:14] <Cork> two == type casts if needed
[02:24:20] <Cork> and === is faster
[02:25:03] <Cork> (same for != vs !==)
[02:25:54] <granden> Ok
[02:28:18] <T-Co> http://jsperf.com/triple-equals-vs-twice-equals
[02:28:58] <Parsi> djQuery: thank you
[02:29:11] <Parsi> and Clex you
[02:29:46] <granden> But why would I benefit from doing that way and not using prev() last() index()?
[02:29:48] <djQuery> Parsi, or easier if you look up slide toggle
[02:30:11] <Clex> Clex me.
[02:30:49] <djQuery> granden, because doing the calculations of the next and previous indexes and then using eq() would be easier
[02:31:15] <granden> Ok
[02:31:16] <djQuery> how are you going to use next when they are on the last? where as you could alsways us eq
[02:31:29] <Cork> granden: next() and last() does't base on your earlier selection
[02:31:34] <Cork> but index() does
[02:31:38] <granden> Ok
[02:31:46] <Cork> so you get a mixed bag and bugs
[02:32:08] <Cork> where ex. next() will give you the actual next button
[02:32:14] <Cork> and other bugs like that
[02:32:25] <djQuery> nexti = current +1; if (nexti>slides.length) { nexti= 0}
[02:32:57] <Cork> granden: but if you go away from using the concept of a selection array it could be done with next/prev
[02:33:14] <djQuery> think that should be >=
[02:33:25] <Cork> ya
[02:33:51] <MacroMan> Is it possible for me to use a partial class name in a selector? Something like $('.something*') or similar.
[02:34:01] <Cork> no
[02:34:11] <MacroMan> Dang
[02:34:22] <Cork> MacroMan: sounds like your classes are constructed the wrong way if you need to
[02:34:28] <djQuery> MacroMan, do you have something else to filter them on first?
[02:34:47] <Cork> .something.else {} in your css file works just as well as .something-else {}
[02:35:15] <Cork> so in other words, use multiple classes if you need things like that
[02:35:16] <MacroMan> djQuery, Yes, li
[02:36:07] <MacroMan> Being able to do that would have made my code about 2 lines instead of 20, but that's the way the cookie crumbles.
[02:38:22] <djQuery> MacroMan, if you cant do it sensibly like Cork said   $('#ul li').filter(function(){ var class= $(this).attr('class'); if (class.indexOf('.something') === -1) { return false} else return true;});
[02:38:48] <Cork> djQuery:  class.indexOf('.something') won't work
[02:39:01] <MacroMan> OK, little stuck here still. Maybe I'm going about it the wrong way. I have a bunch of li's and each one has a class in the format of 'width-**'. I need to be able to get the ** value from the class.
[02:39:30] <MacroMan> The ID field is already used, so I can't put ** as the ID.
[02:39:41] <Clex> MacroMan: check out data(). "hiding" data into the class name is not very classy.
[02:39:43] <Kit-10> sorry granden seems i'm being pulled away by work. Won't be able to provide the help i thought i was going to be able
[02:39:49] <Cork> MacroMan: that sounds like a data- attribute not a class
[02:39:54] <djQuery> MacroMan, literlay *?
[02:40:05] <r1card> What was this saying that any bureaucracygrows to take the budget you give it.
[02:40:07] <djQuery> literally
[02:40:14] <Cork> djQuery: "the ** value"
[02:40:29] <MacroMan> so ** can be any two characters.
[02:40:37] <djQuery> dang
[02:40:49] <MacroMan> but will in practice, be two numbers
[02:40:54] <Cork> MacroMan: sounds like you should be using data-width="**" instead
[02:40:58] <Kit-10> MacroMan: <div id="blah" class="blah" data-width="**" />
[02:41:01] <djQuery> ?data@macroman
[02:41:02] <bot-t> macroman, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[02:41:15] <djQuery> MacroMan, please read that ^^^^^
[02:41:24] <MacroMan> I didn't realise I could have my own tags. Is that supported in all browsers?
[02:41:29] <Kit-10> then, you can use .attr('data-width') or  .data('width')
[02:41:47] <Kit-10> MacroMan: it's not a tag, it's an attribute
[02:41:52] <djQuery> MacroMan, it even works in IE 5
[02:42:02] <Kit-10> browsers only care about key attributes
[02:42:29] <djQuery> MacroMan, if they don't recognize them they are supposed to ignore them
[02:43:21] <djQuery> MacroMan, and putting <li data-width="55">whatever</li>  is valid in html5 and works in all others anyway
[02:46:35] <djQuery> Cork, what happens if you pass -1 to .eq()?
[02:46:57] <Cork> you'll get an empty array i suspect
[02:47:00] <Cork> but not sure
[02:47:06] <djQuery> it will grab the 2nd to last?
[02:47:13] <Cork> ah, thats actually possible
[02:47:48] <djQuery> not intrested enough to put up demo
[02:48:44] <Zepo> Does someone know a JQuery-Ajax Plugin for a dropdown/selectbox where I have also autcomplete OR the complete list with the small arrow.
[02:49:04] <djQuery> ?ui.autocomplete
[02:49:05] <bot-t> The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[02:49:38] <dleonardi> hi, does jquery normalize checkbox/radiobutton "onchange" events on <ie9 ? ie, that the onchange only fires after blur?
[02:50:00] <Zepo> djQuery: I know this one...Fills my first option not the "complete list with the small arrow" and neither the Ajax part.
[02:50:29] <djQuery> Zepo, there used to be a demo with the arrow
[02:50:37] <djQuery> and it does do ajaz
[02:50:40] <djQuery> ajax
[02:51:47] <Zepo> djQuery: I already looked in the API and I found nothing with Ajax :|
[02:52:05] <djQuery> Zepo, http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp
[02:56:31] <djQuery> Zepo, and you can put your own button next to it then call http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#method-search

[02:57:09] <Ov3rTaf> hi all
[02:57:22] <Ov3rTaf> how can i bind a resize event on a div ? :x
[02:57:45] <Cork> Ov3rTaf: you would first have to generate a resize event on the div
[02:58:02] <Cork> $('div').on('resize', function() {})
[02:58:11] <Cork> works just fine, but nothing will trigger it by default
[02:58:32] <Cork> the only element that natively gets a resize event is window
[02:58:45] <Cork> all other has to be generated through js
[02:59:01] <Cork> ($(target).trigger('resize'))
[02:59:41] <Ov3rTaf> ty
[02:59:42] <dleonardi> checkbox/radiobutton onchange normalization anybody?
[02:59:46] <dleonardi> does jquery do it?
[03:00:02] <Cork> normalization?
[03:00:06] <dleonardi> checkboxes in IE fire onchange only AFTER blur
[03:00:12] <dleonardi> which differs from all other browsers
[03:00:18] <Cork> ah, no thats up to you
[03:00:20] <dleonardi> is this adressed in JQ ?
[03:00:30] <dleonardi> whats the best way to normalize that?
[03:00:44] <Cork> i normally just use keypress with a timer
[03:00:54] <dleonardi> yepress doesnt capture click
[03:00:57] <djQuery> $('#mydiv').on('resize', function(){ console.log('resized'); ); $(window).on('resize' function(){ $('#mydiv').trigger('resize'); });
[03:00:59] <Cork> (or click in the case of checkboxes)
[03:01:26] <dleonardi> checkboxes can be set by click, keydown (space key) or who the hell knows how many ways
[03:01:27] <Cork> dleonardi: ya, but the same is true for select boxes
[03:01:44] <dleonardi> Cork: radio, check, select, bunch o stuff
[03:01:49] <Cork> dleonardi: checkboxes and radioboxes will trigger a click from the keyboard too
[03:01:57] <Cork> dleonardi: i know
[03:01:58] <dleonardi> on ie? really?
[03:02:04] <dleonardi> didt know that
[03:02:08] <dleonardi> that sounds even more wrong.
[03:02:09] <dleonardi> lol
[03:02:18] <dleonardi> god.
[03:02:29] <Cork> most pages would break from keyboard navigation without it
[03:02:41] <dleonardi> so, how do you normalize that? got a snippet handy?
[03:03:16] <Cork> $('elm').click(function() {}); for radio/checkbox
[03:03:34] <dleonardi> do you use change at all
[03:03:35] <dleonardi> ?
[03:03:47] <dleonardi> the onchange event i mean
[03:03:49] <Cork> not for checkboxes/radio
[03:04:10] <dleonardi> do selects work fine? i think so, right?
[03:04:21] <Cork> and $('elm').change(function() {  }).keypress(function() { var $self = $(this); setTimeout(function() { $self.trigger('change'); }); });
[03:04:38] <Cork> dleonardi: the change only triggers on blur there too (in some browsers)
[03:04:45] <MacroMan> Cork, djQuery, Sorry called into a meeting. Thank you, I will use attribute tags. They will do what I need thank you.
[03:05:19] <Cork> opps
[03:05:21] <dleonardi> is that timeout a try at debouncing ?
[03:05:24] <Cork> and $('elm').change(function() {  }).keypress(function() { var $self = $(this); setTimeout(function() { $self.trigger('change'); }, 0); });
[03:05:30] <dleonardi> cuz i dont see the timeout reset
[03:05:56] <dleonardi> why a timeout with 0 ?
[03:05:58] <Cork> opps sorry thats for type="text" :x
[03:06:02] <dleonardi> thats a terrible idea
[03:06:06] <Cork> not select; man i always mix them up
[03:06:13] <Cork> ya select is fine
[03:06:14] <dleonardi> could lose that if the browser is overloaded
[03:06:37] <Cork> uh.. no they have the same problem >_<
[03:06:45] <djQuery> Cork, what if the key was tab?
[03:07:21] <agnello> i am using lazy load jquery , i have a issue where i have  two parallel divs ---  <div class="LHS" > <div> images1 </div> <div> images3 </div> </div>  <div class="RHS"> <div> images2 </div> <div> images4 </div> </div>  and when i am using lazy load jquery  image 1 and image 3 gets loaded .. and then only does image2 and image 4 get loaded .. how do i get image 1 and image 2 to get loaded first and image3 and image 4 to be loaded second .. thanks
[03:07:22] <Cork> dleonardi: the timer is there to let the browser update the field, so you can get the event with the new value in the field
[03:07:42] <Cork> djQuery: well normally thats fine, its just one extra validation
[03:07:47] <Cork> normally not a big deal
[03:07:48] <dleonardi> Cork: what?
[03:07:52] <dleonardi> no.
[03:08:00] <dleonardi> thats an attempt at queueing load
[03:08:05] <dleonardi> a bad one, id say
[03:08:13] <Cork> dleonardi: keypress triggers before the value is added to the field
[03:08:17] <dleonardi> i dont think that .val isnt available in the handler
[03:08:26] <Cork> the trigger is just to let the browser do that update and then trigger change
[03:08:37] <Cork> dleonardi: it is, but its the old value
[03:08:42] <dleonardi> rly?
[03:08:43] <dleonardi> so
[03:08:47] <dleonardi> why not use onkeyup ?
[03:09:02] <Cork> it only triggers when the user releases the key
[03:09:07] <Cork> so kkkkkkkkkkkkkkk only triggers one
[03:09:18] <Cork> one sec let me make a demo
[03:09:18] <dleonardi> yah
[03:09:21] <dleonardi> thats what you want
[03:09:35] <Cork> dleonardi: it depends
[03:09:48] <dleonardi> i'm specifically talking about checkedy inputs
[03:09:55] <dleonardi> radios, selects, checkboxes, and the like
[03:10:24] <agnello> i am using lazy load jquery , i have a issue where i have  two parallel divs ---  <div class="LHS" > <div> images1 </div> <div> images3 </div> </div>  <div class="RHS"> <div> images2 </div> <div> images4 </div> </div>  and when i am using lazy load jquery  image 1 and image 3 gets loaded .. and then only does image2 and image 4 get loaded .. how do i get image 1 and image 2 to get loaded first and image3 and image 4 to be loaded second .. thanks
[03:10:31] <Cork> dleonardi: for those, like i said, just use click
[03:10:35] <dleonardi> also, i cant imagine it to be a good idea to , for instance, validate input against a webservice on every keypress (thats a lotta load)
[03:10:55] <dleonardi> thats why i was thinking you might be doing some deboucing with that timeout
[03:10:58] <dleonardi> anyhow
[03:11:00] <Cork> dleonardi: ya, thats not really the case i'm after
[03:11:05] <dleonardi> i digress :)
[03:11:10] <dleonardi> thanks :)
[03:19:33] <Cork> dleonardi: http://jsfiddle.net/4Ef97/
[03:21:01] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/4Ef97/1/ might actually give a bit more manageable values
[03:21:31] <dleonardi> lol float rounding error
[03:21:31] <Cork> notice how the time is the only one that always give you the correct value
[03:21:38] <Cork> *timer
[03:22:17] <dleonardi> hm, i see
[03:22:18] <dleonardi> thanks :)
[03:22:58] <Cork> another funny one when it comes to events and forms is that opera will only trigger keyup on some elements (if i remember correctly
[03:23:10] <dleonardi> i love it how the keypress values are different
[03:23:37] <dleonardi> bunch of differing values here
[03:23:39] <dleonardi> meh.
[03:23:56] <Braden`> Hello
[03:24:06] <Braden`> Does anyone know of a good tutorial for ajax callbacks?
[03:24:17] <Braden`> I have ajax running now, but its not using callbacks
[03:24:26] <dleonardi> screw callbacks
[03:24:28] <dleonardi> learn promises
[03:24:38] <dleonardi> .then FTW
[03:24:46] <discorpia> haha
[03:25:17] <Cork> Braden`: are you talking about making async ajax calls?
[03:25:30] <Cork> or what exactly about callbacks is it you need help with?
[03:25:35] <dleonardi> Braden`: but just ask whats uncear to you
[03:25:36] <Braden`> I would like to think that AJAX is more like my doctor who calls me back and not like my mom who won't give me a callback
[03:25:46] <Braden`> async aye
[03:26:01] <dleonardi> the first one, aye
[03:26:02] <Braden`> So the user can do stuff while we wait for a return
[03:26:05] <dleonardi> yep
[03:26:08] <dleonardi> async.
[03:26:12] <dleonardi> callbacks.
[03:26:13] <dleonardi> so?
[03:26:22] <Braden`> "How do I ...?"
[03:26:44] <Cork> Braden`: $.ajax/$.post/$.get all tag a callback argument
[03:27:00] <Braden`> I figured I would just ask if there are any async tutorials you would recommend.  There are quite a few on Google, but I am not sure which one would be best.
[03:27:01] <Cork> just give it a function ex. $.ajax(url, { success: function() {} })
[03:27:14] <Cork> Braden`: that function will be called when its done
[03:27:14] <dleonardi> http://api.jquery.com/ajaxSuccess/
[03:27:24] <Braden`> Ok, thank you
[03:27:34] <xec> or $.ajax().done(function(){...})
[03:27:35] <Cork> Braden`: there isn't really much need for a tutorial, its quite simple
[03:28:04] <Cork> dleonardi: and ajaxSuccess isn't really for this case
[03:28:22] <dleonardi> done is a promise though
[03:28:28] <dleonardi> success is a callback
[03:28:29] <Cork> ya
[03:28:39] <Cork> its basically the same
[03:28:43] <dleonardi> minor differences
[03:28:50] <Cork> the difference is just in how you define them
[03:29:17] <xec> dleonardi: it is still called a "callback" http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[03:29:27] <Zepo> Hmmm... I found a nice plugin and it works but only after the second change . Like, I change the Values -> not changed, I change the Values again -> values from before change are displayed
[03:29:31] <Cork> ?.callbacks
[03:29:41] <Cork> bah...
[03:29:51] <Cork> anyway ^ thats the backend for deferred
[03:30:17] <dleonardi> xec: but its invoked by the promise, and not passed to the ajax request itself
[03:30:39] <Cork> dleonardi: either is the callback actually
[03:30:47] <Cork> its all handled in the ajax function
[03:30:53] <Braden`> hmm
[03:30:53] <dleonardi> Cork: i do everything with deferreds nowadays
[03:31:02] <Braden`> So should I use ajaxSuccess or ajaxDeferred?
[03:31:03] <Cork> and seen from the code flow its mostly the same thing
[03:31:10] <dleonardi> got two requests? no problem. chain them.
[03:31:13] <dleonardi> bam.
[03:31:16] <Cork> dleonardi: ya, but like i said, its basically the same thing
[03:31:19] <dleonardi> do that with callbacks. madness.
[03:31:20] <Braden`> It seems ajaxSuccess is for a single callback while ajaxDeferred can handle multiple?
[03:31:42] <Cork> Braden`: ya, ajaxSuccess is a global function
[03:31:51] <Cork> for things like showing a throbber when ajax is active
[03:33:21] <Cork> `.Callbacks
[03:33:28] <Cork> beeeh... :/
[03:33:32] <xec> Cork: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[03:33:37] <Cork> LOL
[03:33:39] <xec> :P
[03:33:49] <Cork> was trying to get the new bot working
[03:33:51] <Braden`> The bot fell asleep
[03:34:09] <Cork> got xec instead :>
[03:34:23] * xec dances the robot
[03:34:40] <Cork> hmm wonder if anything has happend to js> "hello"
[03:34:43] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[03:34:46] <Cork> nope
[03:34:48] <Cork> ^^
[03:34:52] <xec> lol
[03:35:09] <xec> js> print("hello")
[03:35:11] <b-ot> xec: hello
[03:35:17] <xec> hi, b-ot!
[03:35:31] <Cork> xec: theres been plans of making that part work like in the old bot
[03:35:57] <xec> like, the ?eval ?
[03:36:01] <Cork> ya
[03:36:17] <Cork> b-ot is meant to take over for bot-t
[03:36:26] <Cork> when it gets done that is
[03:37:48] <xec> cool, can't wait ;)
[03:37:54] <Braden`> I have read the .ajaxSuccess and callbacks pages.  The examples they provide are snippets though.  Does anyone have a full example usage?
[03:38:06] <BadCodSmell> Why doesn't data work between events?
[03:38:17] <Cork> Braden`: show the $.ajax page
[03:38:23] <Cork> it should have all you need there
[03:38:35] <Cork> BadCodSmell: between?
[03:41:19] <BadCodSmell> Cork: $('<div/>').data('elvis', 1000).click(function() {console.log($(this).data('elvis'))}).click(); while this works, often I have a case where it only works if I forcefully set it to use the attr command for setting data
[03:41:45] <Braden`> Found the $.ajax page.  Thank you
[03:42:07] <Cork> BadCodSmell: can't see how that would ever be a problem
[03:42:16] <Cork> BadCodSmell: can you generate a working testcase?
[03:43:03] <Cork> i've used data a lot and never had any problems with it; and i mainly use it to store values between events so...
[04:01:13] <Drager> I'm trying to make a "Preview post" with jquery and I do it like this; http://jsfiddle.net/EcfeR/ works but it's buggy if you spam the tabs. Any ideas?
[04:06:30] <granden> Cork: Oh, you wouldnt have need to complete it. But thank you really mutch. Now I shall just compare my version and yours to see what you did change. Thanks!
[04:37:37] <reddaemon> I am just starting to learn javascript and jquery
[04:37:49] <reddaemon> I come from a c# background
[04:38:01] <reddaemon> any comments on recommended reading
[04:38:37] <reddaemon> i am busy going through the frontend masters workshop series
[04:40:02] <deepy> try.jquery.org
[04:43:11] <reddaemon> deeply: hi i was more asking around books
[04:43:19] <reddaemon> with best practices etc.
[05:01:48] <chilversc_> I can't work out the selector to ignore specific nested elements for a live event http://jsfiddle.net/uwnhH/
[05:10:49] <seutje> chilversc_: not sure what the exact point of this is, but you're changing the value of the checkbox right after the native implementation handles it
[05:11:15] <seutje> and since ur event isn't bound to the checkbox, u gotta manually check if e.target matches it
[05:13:04] <seutje> chilversc_: http://jsfiddle.net/uwnhH/1/ is a possible solution
[05:13:22] <seutje> another would be to use a proper <label> element and letter the native implementation handle it
[05:20:07] <chilversc_> seutje: it does have a label in the full implementation, the outer element is a large div with more details
[05:20:24] <seutje> oh, alright
[05:21:30] <chilversc_> actually, just realised that isn't quite correct as jqm then adds more padding :s
[05:21:50] <chilversc_> so the final markup is something more like http://jsfiddle.net/uwnhH/2/
[05:32:17] <RichardP_> Hi, is there a specific syntax for accessing html5 sections with a role?
[05:32:51] <RichardP_> or do i have to access it as an attr?
[05:32:52] <seutje> $('section[role]')
[05:33:10] <seutje> .attr('role')
[05:33:15] <seutje> chilversc_: http://jsfiddle.net/uwnhH/3/
[05:33:24] <RichardP_> yeah, so theres no equiv of . or # then?
[05:33:53] <seutje> ?g css attribute selectors
[05:33:54] <b-ot> seutje: CSS Attribute Selector → http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_attribute_selectors.asp
[05:33:57] <seutje> WHOA
[05:34:11] <seutje> ?g "attribute selectors" -w3schools
[05:34:11] <b-ot> seutje: The Skinny on CSS Attribute Selectors | CSS-Tricks → http://css-tricks.com/attribute-selectors/
[05:40:36] <chilversc_> seutje: I was wondering if its possible to just have a .is check that checks the parents?
[05:40:48] <chilversc_> can you create a selector that asserts something about the parent?
[05:41:15] <chilversc_> well, not just the parents, more like self or parent
[05:41:47] <masentinel900> Good morning guys!!
[05:42:02] <masentinel900> Guys Have a problem!!
[05:42:21] <chilversc_> I guess something like xpath's ancestor-or-self axis
[05:42:39] <masentinel900> Onload the page show me in the error console the next   ::   jQuery is not defined
[05:42:47] <masentinel900> Why?
[05:46:33] <chilversc_> hmm something like; .is(ancestor-or-self::.inner) would be what I'm after
[05:49:14] <resonant> you know how if you use an object more than one, you should store it in a variable?
[05:49:37] <resonant> so if i use $('#foo') a lot, i should do $foo = $('#foo')?  does that apply for $(window) too?
[05:51:05] <seutje> chilversc_: .closest('label').length
[05:51:16] <seutje> think that also checks the current item
[05:52:08] <juha_> resonant: yes
[05:52:16] <resonant> thanks
[05:52:29] <chilversc_> seutje: yeah
[05:53:16] <seutje> chilversc_: seems to work: http://jsfiddle.net/uwnhH/4/
[05:53:33] <seutje> label is sort of an exception here though
[05:53:48] <chilversc_> seutje: yup, pretty much what I got as well
[05:53:53] <chilversc_> seutje: thanks
[05:53:55] <seutje> like, in the way it automatically propagates clicks to the checkbox inside
[05:54:24] <chilversc_> though I targeted the outer wrapper .inner instead, since jqm adds a load of markup that wraps the checkbox and has its own click handlers
[05:54:55] <ahhhh> dudesss why this is flashing? http://pastebin.com/vdJcqYYm
[05:54:56] <seutje> oh
[05:55:05] <seutje> yeah, don't rly have any experience with jqm
[05:56:00] <seutje> ahhhh: don't bind within an event handler
[05:56:09] <seutje> ahhhh: what are you trying to accomplish?
[05:56:35] <ahhhh> on mouseenter set that on mouseout will close menu
[05:56:55] <ahhhh> so fire when i'm inside menu if inside bind close on mouseout
[05:57:08] <ahhhh> else nothing
[05:57:27] <seutje> ahhhh: so, how do u expect a mouseout to be triggered without first triggering a mouseenter?
[05:57:37] <systemfault> ahhhh: I didn't see your code but just in case… The opposite of mouseenter isn't mouseout, it's mouseleave
[05:57:39] <ahhhh> i used mouseenter
[05:57:49] <ahhhh> if mouseenter bind mouseout function
[05:58:12] <seutje> so essentially, binding just the mouseout should be sufficient
[05:58:22] <mhn23> hello. i got a horizontal page with joomla. i want to set the width of the #content to the width of all items. so i got a script but atm i have to manually add every class to the script
[05:58:26] <ahhhh> wtf dude ) it was mouseleave
[05:58:29] <ahhhh> it fixed all
[05:58:31] <ahhhh> beatufiluuu
[05:58:35] <ahhhh> thanksss
[05:58:43] <seutje> ur still rebinding on every mouseenter
[05:58:50] <mhn23> so here is the problem: http://jsfiddle.net/eMAJB/1/
[05:59:13] <mhn23> joomla creates a class "leading-NUMBER" and adds a clear div
[05:59:41] <mhn23> so is there a way to exclude the clear div from the script?
[06:00:07] <systemfault> ….
[06:00:52] <seutje> mhn23: it's already excluding those, no?
[06:01:08] <mhn23> yeah but it want it to be dynamic
[06:01:23] <mhn23> so i can add pages later and don't have to manually add em to the script
[06:01:55] <chilversc_> seutje: final implementation with a few jqm mark up bits added http://jsfiddle.net/uwnhH/6/
[06:02:53] <seutje> mhn23: like http://jsfiddle.net/eMAJB/2/ ?
[06:03:11] <chilversc_> and expanded to also work when jqm hasn't added its markup http://jsfiddle.net/uwnhH/7/
[06:05:30] <chilversc_> oh meh, the expantion doesn't work because jqm moves the checkbox out of the label
[06:05:46] <chilversc_> so I guess I'll stick with version 6
[06:05:58] <mhn23> thx it did work. just changed it to the .items-leading container the items were in
[06:06:12] <mhn23> thank you very much
[06:07:20] <chilversc_> and now to work out why clicking an element toggles the header's fixed state :s
[06:07:20] <BadCodSmell> Why doesn't data always work between events?
[06:07:48] <chilversc_> ah, its the clicking the page that does it, hmm
[06:13:11] <gener1c> i tried making my header act like this one http://jsfiddle.net/zD5RU/8/ here http://178.79.135.194:4567/ (view in 500px)
[06:13:24] <gener1c> and for some reason its not fixed positioned :/
[06:20:32] <juria_roberts> Through html() im putting text inside a div but i can see it the html tags printed <font color='red'>Invalid CSV format in line 3<br/></font>. This text comes from json
[06:39:19] <BLeg> If I use jQuery to select an array of objects, how can I access the 0th index of the returned array as a jQuery object and not a DOM element? Right now I'm doing this-> $($('selector')[0]); but I feel like it's not the right way to do it.
[06:43:27] <noregret> i'm using $.getJSON(), what can I use in order to do something *after* the ajax request completes
[06:44:05] <chilversc_> BLeg: you could use :first
[06:44:09] <noregret> nevermind
[06:44:13] <BLeg> noregret: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[06:44:21] <BLeg> There's a success function
[06:44:35] <noregret> yaeh, go it
[06:44:37] <chilversc_> BLeg: if you have an existing jquery object then .first()
[06:44:39] <noregret> got *
[06:45:04] <BLeg> chilversc_: Yes I could use first in that instance... I guess that was a bad example though, it could be any index.
[06:45:38] <chilversc_> BLeg: then there's the :nth-child(N) selector
[06:46:17] <sahbeewah_> :eq(n) is what you're after
[06:46:18] <chilversc_> ah, hmm that might not always give what you want
[06:46:27] <sahbeewah_> :nth-child(n) does something else
[06:46:37] <BLeg> chilversc_: So the short answer is 'No, it's not possible' then?
[06:46:57] <BLeg> because yeah.... what sahbeewah said, nth-child selects multiple objects
[06:47:16] <BLeg> :eq(n)... hmm, I'll look
[06:48:22] <BLeg> sahbeewah_: That's exactly what I was looking for, thanks a lot

[06:54:53] <StephenS> when I click on link with id="..." and href=# it do whats its supposed to do, but it put it me on the top of page, why?
[06:55:22] <Tsd_> because your href points to the top of the page
[06:55:51] <Tsd_> href="#" is an anchor
[06:56:36] <StephenS> and how to not do it?
[06:56:51] <StephenS> how is that Like system done?
[06:58:19] <Tsd_> http://www.boogiejack.com/html/html-anchor-tag.html
[06:58:37] <Tsd_> i don't know where you want to point at
[06:59:01] <Tsd_> ah damn t
[06:59:06] <Tsd_> tutorial is crap
[06:59:06] <StephenS> No where
[06:59:07] <Tsd_> sec
[06:59:18] <StephenS> Tsd_, here http://jsfiddle.net/83RLn/
[06:59:34] <StephenS> this code works, however when I have mutliple likes on page, I want to remain on where I selected like
[06:59:38] <StephenS> like it was make on facebook..
[07:01:35] <StephenS> Tsd_, !?
[07:02:36] <Tsd_> sec
[07:02:39] <Tsd_> i have to login
[07:02:39] <StephenS> nvm I added event and put event.preventDefault();
[07:02:40] <Tsd_> :D
[07:02:43] <Tsd_> it is easy
[07:02:47] <StephenS> Ya works now..
[07:02:54] <Tsd_> just use span instead of a
[07:02:56] <Tsd_> :D
[07:03:11] <StephenS> event.preventDefault(); works for me :)
[07:03:22] <Tsd_> or that way
[07:03:33] <Tsd_> but why do u use a href if is not a link
[07:03:37] <Tsd_> it is just a button
[07:03:39] <Tsd_> :D
[07:04:40] <StephenS> facebook use href=# too
[07:04:42] <StephenS> for like..
[07:06:14] <Tsd_> but facebook is not godlike
[07:06:20] <Tsd_> if it works ...
[07:06:45] <Tsd_> do anybody knows what's wrong at my code?
[07:06:46] <clockman> I'm trying to use jquery-ui dialog boxes, but every "X" in the close button appears to be offset by about 20 pixels - http://imgur.com/ldoG8jb Every other icon is positioned fine. I've tried multiple themes, all do the same thing Anyone know what could be wrong?
[07:08:33] <clockman> jquery: 1.9.1, jquery-ui: 1.10.1
[07:09:06] <Tsd_> it's hard to say what's wrong
[07:09:16] <Tsd_> is there any online version of your page
[07:09:36] <Tsd_> maybe there is some css rule
[07:11:21] <darkfrog> It looks like _renderItem has been removed from jQuery UI 1.10.1 but how do I allow HTML in the complete results now?
[07:13:54] <dalibor> Can  I ask somthing about jQuery here?
[07:15:50] <deepy> dalibor: no, you should ask that in #jquery
[07:15:56] <tra> hi
[07:16:35] <tra> is it normal, that when i do $('input').val() on an empty field that has a placeholder attribute in place, that val() returns the placeholder string?
[07:16:36] <StephenS> dalibor, ne moze
[07:16:48] <StephenS> tra yes
[07:17:21] <tra> and same thing if i do attr('value') and it's empty and it still returns the placeholder?
[07:17:21] <StephenS> val takes the value of any id you have given
[07:17:31] <tra> the value is empty
[07:17:31] <StephenS> current value is the placeholder, while in php/js that is not a case
[07:17:36] <StephenS> so maybe bug?
[07:17:44] <tra> sounds like one
[07:18:01] <StephenS> tra well if value is empty, then is all good, as it does not took placeholder value
[07:18:20] <tra> well it returns the placeholder
[07:20:25] <chilversc_> Tsd_: found your answer, duplicate of an existing question
[07:20:53] <chilversc_> Tsd_: also, for code blocks on SO, you don't wrap them in backticks, just indent by 4 spaces
[07:22:39] <Tsd_> do you have a link to this answer?
[07:23:31] <Tsd_> well i repost it in the jqm forum, because i just found that forum today :D
[07:24:27] <WHTM> I'm trying to make a site which draws data from a single XML file at different points through out the site (populates a grid/carousel mainly), is there any reason I shouldn't put all my functions in the success function of .ajax?? As I'm just going to be referencing this data continuously anyway.
[07:24:29] <chilversc_> also, anyone with a score of 5 or more in jquery-mobile on SO, the tag could do with adding the synonym jqm I think
[07:24:47] <WHTM> And the site won't be usable without it, as it will lack any content
[07:27:43] <sahbeewah> WHTM, as in, define the function in the success callback?
[07:27:57] <Tsd_> @chilversc_ it works for a sek but the it loose the format :-(
[07:28:22] <Tsd_> 	content.html(this.view).trigger("create");
[07:28:24] <Tsd_>         header.html(this.header).trigger("create");
[07:28:34] <Tsd_> do i do it right?
[07:29:14] <chilversc_> Tsd_: jsfiddle a small example?
[07:29:26] <WHTM> As in.. to use the data I take from the xml file, I'd either need to use a function in success which abstracts it out to an array or similar. OR can I just put the rest of my JS inside the success function, so one the one hand it will only run if the file loads successfully, but it also means I don't need to abstract the data
[07:29:36] <WHTM> Right?
[07:29:47] <chilversc_> Tsd_: actually, jsbin, since that supports jqm
[07:30:06] <Tsd_> it's hard to do that because i use jqm with Javascript mvc
[07:30:14] <WHTM> Or can't I use $(xml).find(…. Throught out my script now I've run .ajax??>
[07:30:20] <WHTM> can*
[07:30:26] <Tsd_> i don't know how to put my controller and model and so on at jsfiddle
[07:32:04] <chilversc_> Tsd_: I mean asmall example that just has basic html and javascript that reproduces the problem
[07:32:09] <chilversc_> Tsd_: the simplest thing possible
[07:32:26] <Tsd_> hmmm give me a sec
[07:33:13] <karstenk1977_> please can somebody tell me why the request on this page doesn´t stop? http://opdenakker.tom-develop.com/index.php?id=702
[07:33:26] <chilversc_> Tsd_: because .trigger('create') works fine for me
[07:37:13] <sahbeewah> WHTM, kind of confusing as to what you mean, but if you're talking about having a separate function to deal with parsing the data in the xml, you're better off putting that outside the success callback so you're not redefining it every time you make that ajax call
[07:37:32] <Tsd_> hmmm maybe it is easier to upload the whole stuff to an public webspace
[07:37:34] <Tsd_> sec
[07:37:35] <sahbeewah> and yes, you can use $(xml).find(...), given that the xml is well formed

[07:39:26] <masentinel900> Someone can say me how can I pass the data to fancybox function with data var?
[07:40:32] <chilversc_> Tsd_: not really, the main reason for a small simple example is it makes it easier to test/debug and fiddle with
[07:40:45] <dzined> anyone in here running IE8 on Windows XP/Vista/7?
[07:40:50] <Tsd_> i try to do one
[07:40:51] <chilversc_> Tsd_: a massive chunk of code requires a lot more effort to understand what is happening and to set up
[07:40:59] <Tsd_> it will take some time
[07:41:25] <chilversc_> Tsd_: yeah, I know, but then again I often find the cause of the error whist distilling the code down to the simplest thing that reproduces it
[07:43:07] <chilversc_> dzined: nope, but we do still have some XP machines that run IE8, since it's the last version XP supports
[07:46:03] <masentinel900> Guys!!, Someone know if are there some option for may clean the last onlcik on fancybox?

[07:49:33] <Hikerakashiya> anyone having issues with the jQuery Themerolle?
[07:49:51] <Hikerakashiya> it appears that the Themeroller is not loading styles correctly ...

[07:53:56] <Tsd_> @chilversc_ : http://jsfiddle.net/Sebtra/WczLY/9/

[07:55:15] <Tsd_> but the back button is not rendered
[08:00:11] <BadCodSmell> Why doesn't data always work between events?
[08:00:36] <BadCodSmell> I have a case where sometimes it works, but to work all the time I need to force the data into the attribute.
[08:00:45] <BadCodSmell> If I just use.data it doesn't always work
[08:02:16] <BadCodSmell> if I make my own function: function commander_data(element, key, value) {element.data(key, value);element.attr('data-'+key, JSON.stringify(value));} it always works
[08:02:32] <BadCodSmell> Why?
[08:02:56] <BadCodSmell> This has to be some kind of a jquery failure to bring back the element surely?
[08:04:07] <BadCodSmell> If it works by adding attr I can't see how it could be something in my code.
[08:04:18] <BadCodSmell> It has to be that jquery is broken somehow.
[08:06:28] <Tsd_> @chilversc_ just let me know if you can see the problem and my jsfiddle work in the correct wrong way :D
[08:09:50] <BadCodSmell> The only stuff I can find online are things like idiot does not now data wants json: http://lookfirst.com/2011/12/dont-use-jquery-data-method-use-attr.html
[08:09:51] <chilversc_> Tsd_: ah, you're trying to re-write the change page logic
[08:10:19] <chilversc_> Tsd_: that's a completly different question to just marking up the page due to a dynamic change
[08:11:16] <Tsd_> puh that's the way i found to do it with JMVC and JQM
[08:12:14] <chilversc_> Tsd_: yes, but here the problem isn't the dynamic content changing due to say a button press, but dynamic content during a page change event
[08:12:48] <chilversc_> Tsd_: why arn't you just using jqm's in-built handling for this?
[08:15:24] <chilversc_> Tsd_: here's a concept that sort of works http://jsfiddle.net/WczLY/10/
[08:15:36] <chilversc_> Tsd_: but it breaks other jqm handling such as the back button, etc
[08:16:04] <dzined> if you are running IE8 on windows would someone be able to do me a quick favour and try http://www.alexandraleckie.co.uk and let me know if you get the hover over for Menu in the navigation bar
[08:16:06] <chilversc_> Tsd_: I went with setTimeout just to prevent re-wiring the page in the middle of handling the page change event
[08:16:48] <chilversc_> Tsd_: but really, this is a horrible way to handle this, as it goes against how jqm works
[08:18:14] <derik> how i get number of records from json ?
[08:19:32] <Tsd_> ok i'll check your other way of doing that
[08:19:41] <Tsd_> thanks for that hint
[08:19:55] <chilversc_> Tsd_: the other way is to have an actual separate page with a different id, and just let JQM handle the hash change
[08:20:16] <chilversc_> Tsd_: or if you want ajax loading, have the other page on a separate URL and let JQM download the other page using ajax
[08:20:47] <Tsd_> but this will works against the MVC of my mobile app
[08:21:02] <Tsd_> i have some content templates and header templates
[08:21:08] <Tsd_> and put them together
[08:21:16] <Tsd_> to put them into the page
[08:21:30] <Tsd_> so i should prepare the whole page
[08:21:44] <Tsd_> generate them and download it via JQM
[08:21:51] <Tsd_> or what woul you do?
[08:22:06] <masentinel900> Someone know what options will delete the cache of the onlclick
[08:22:32] <masentinel900> in fancybox?
[08:23:08] <Tsd_> i did it closed to some tuts and to the docs of JQM
[08:23:10] <Tsd_> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0/docs/pages/page-dynamic.html
[08:23:56] <Tsd_> at the last code block it is similar the same way
[08:24:01] <Tsd_> isn't it
[08:27:07] <mhn23> hey guys me again. can somebody recommend me a way to enable/disable a script when building a responsive layout?

[08:27:52] <andrewSC> hi all
[08:28:09] <mg9831> How can I add a callback to the .append() method?
[08:29:09] <andrewSC> I have an html element with the 'value' attr.  The 'value' attr contains an array such that value="["foo","bar","baz"]". How do I append to the array within value?
[08:30:10] <andrewSC> so after appending I would expect something like value="["foo","bar","baz","foobar"]" to be reflected in the DOM
[08:36:57] <andrewSC> cool, I'm just going to use splice with some other things.
[08:38:06] <karstenk1977_> please can somebody tell me, whats wrong with this viewer?

[08:56:12] <brutalhonesty> <masentinel900> well? Fire away
[08:56:16] <masentinel900> See, I'm opening a modal windows with fancybox, The first time open with trouble, But from there on show me an erro in the console firefox  ::  $.fancybox is not a function
[08:56:40] <brutalhonesty> hmm
[08:56:48] <brutalhonesty> lets figure the obv out
[08:57:01] <brutalhonesty> first, i havent dealt with fancybox so lemme quickly read about it but
[08:57:09] <brutalhonesty> do you have the src included in the html?
[08:57:27] <brutalhonesty> <script type="text/javascript" src="/fancybox/jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.pack.js"></script> or something of the sort?
[08:57:36] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/nB44k/
[08:57:48] <brutalhonesty> cool
[08:58:10] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/nB44k/1/
[08:59:14] <brutalhonesty> well, its not throwing the error now for me: http://jsfiddle.net/nB44k/2/
[08:59:30] <brutalhonesty> i added the jquery and fancy box into the external resources but its still not showing
[09:01:08] <newtonianb> I'm trying to write a jquery plugin that on init takes a bunch of parameters, later I want to execute a seperate funciton within that plugin that can re-use the inputted parameter, is this do-able?
[09:01:45] <newtonianb> is this what does it?  base.$el.data("NS.myPlugin", base);
[09:02:55] <djQuery> masentinel900, what is the post returning? is it returning html with a script tag declared in the html
[09:03:09] <brutalhonesty> newtonianb: not sure about that one, but masentinel900, the jsfiddle that you had was including files that were not external resources which is probably why they are not working. You had /js/... which is a local file. But you can't have a local file to jsfiddle unless you add it
[09:03:38] <djQuery> masentinel900, does the return happen to re-initialize jquery those blowing the $.fn.fnacybox away?
[09:10:17] <brutalhonesty> So here is a working model of fancybox that I setup from their tutorials. http://jsfiddle.net/nB44k/5/
[09:10:35] <brutalhonesty> This includes the css/js files from fancybox as external resources as well as jquery
[09:11:19] <brutalhonesty> Not advertising for them but I use this site for my cdn for most of my scripts/css: http://cdnjs.com
[09:12:41] <ezio> http://206.248.142.234:52170/company_profile?company_id=1 ... can someone take a look at this and tell me why the datatables are appearing with a scroll bar?
[09:13:19] <ezio> as you can see, the one at the bottom, i've taken scrollx out of
[09:13:20] <djQuery> ezio, slow
[09:14:21] <ezio> djQuery, sorry i work for a pen testing place ... we don't like to open ports.  they might be throttling... it was a major political thing to get this port opened
[09:14:36] <djQuery> ezio, it works
[09:16:04] <brutalhonesty> I got connected ezio, my initial thought was, you included a datatables.scroller.min.js, is there one without scroller?
[09:16:44] <ezio> umm ... i don't know ... it's a theme project ... lemme see if i can get rid of that
[09:17:26] <brutalhonesty> kk
[09:17:31] <djQuery> ezio, for me only the 1st table has a scroll
[09:17:36] <brutalhonesty> same
[09:17:41] <brutalhonesty> ^
[09:17:45] <drakythe> Is there a way to have an a link that links to "#" not jump to the top of my page?
[09:17:57] <ezio> yeah i did that on purpose ... you can see that without the scroll bar it still goes past the edge of the table bounds
[09:18:02] <djQuery> ezio, not sure if 2nd doesn't have a scroll because of the fact that its empty
[09:18:11] <brutalhonesty> drakythe, yeah i think its prevent default action, or something of the sort
[09:18:15] <ezio> nope ... i just took out scrollx
[09:18:35] <brutalhonesty> event.preventDefault(), maybe?
[09:18:54] <KeyboardNotFound> How to use value of input box in jquery ?
[09:19:12] <KeyboardNotFound> ex. how to console.log the value of input text box with id ="text" ?
[09:19:14] <brutalhonesty> KeyboardNotFound: $(element).val() ?
[09:19:40] <KeyboardNotFound> brutalhonesty: Thank you very much
[09:19:53] <brutalhonesty> No problem, hope it works!
[09:20:01] <drakythe> brutalhonesty: yeah that looks like what I need... thanks!
[09:20:09] <brutalhonesty> No problem drakythe!
[09:20:22] <djQuery> KeyboardNotFound, jquery uses css selectors so $('#test').val()
[09:20:26] <Drager>  I'm trying to make a "Preview post" with jquery and I do it like this; http://jsfiddle.net/EcfeR/ works but it's buggy if you spam the tabs. Any ideas?
[09:20:47] <KeyboardNotFound> but, how to edit value of input text box ?
[09:20:55] <djQuery> $(
[09:21:04] <brutalhonesty> set the html() ?
[09:21:11] <djQuery> $('#test').val('hello world');
[09:21:13] <brutalhonesty> $(element).html("something here")
[09:21:15] <brutalhonesty> or that ^
[09:21:17] <ezio> k i'm prettys ure the scroller is out
[09:21:22] <brutalhonesty> nice ezio
[09:21:40] <ezio> no i mean the scroller.min.js
[09:21:44] <ezio> still the same issu
[09:21:44] <ezio> e
[09:21:46] <brutalhonesty> oh haha
[09:21:52] <brutalhonesty> shall i refresh and check?
[09:22:11] <djQuery> you still have a div with a class of dataTables_scroll
[09:22:48] <brutalhonesty> ^ noticed that too
[09:23:07] <djQuery> ezio, the 2nd table doesn't have that wrapper div
[09:23:50] <ezio> right ... i need that to be there there is a chance that it will have to overflow, but not likely on a pc unless you make the browser sufficiently small.  the wrapper is put there by the scrollx.  still that is clearly not the issue as even the one without scrollx goes past it's boundaries
[09:23:50] <brutalhonesty> Drager: are you trying to prevent them from clicking more than once?
[09:26:03] <djQuery> Drager, test to see which one is shown and return if the one that they are clicking on is allready shown
[09:26:36] <Drager> brutalhonesty: Yeah
[09:26:39] <ezio> brutalhonesty, djQuery another thing i forgot to mention
[09:26:56] <ezio> if i datatable.fnAdjustColumnSizing() it puts it back
[09:27:17] <ezio> but i can't find a place to do it
[09:27:32] <ezio> it only works if the page is fully loaded and i run that through the console
[09:27:46] <brutalhonesty> Drager: well preventing after one click can be things like: $(element).one('click', function(){}) or you can do a $(element).click(function(){$(element).attr(disabled, disabled);}); sorta deal
[09:28:25] <Drager> brutalhonesty: Will try that out
[09:28:29] <brutalhonesty> Drager: kk
[09:28:45] <brutalhonesty> ezio: so you can't run the above command till the page is loaded?
[09:29:02] <ezio> yup
[09:29:10] <ezio> i mean
[09:29:13] <ezio> with effect
[09:29:17] <brutalhonesty> hmm
[09:29:27] <brutalhonesty> can ya wait for if(is ready)
[09:31:24] <Drager> brutalhonesty: I don't really see how I can make it disabled within my code
[09:31:47] <ezio> brutalhonesty, yes it even has a call back for when it's finished
[09:31:53] <brutalhonesty> Drager: hmm, do you have a jsfiddle with some of the stuff you want it to work with?
[09:31:59] <ezio> still that didn't work either
[09:32:32] <Drager> brutalhonesty: Yes, I linked one. Didnt I?=
[09:32:33] <brutalhonesty> ezio: hmm, kinda stumped tbh, maybe if you need the scroll at certain times, add the attr back to the div tag when its needed?
[09:32:46] <brutalhonesty> Drager: ah yeah, you're right, lemme try it out
[09:32:49] <Drager> brutalhonesty: Anyhow; http://jsfiddle.net/EcfeR/
[09:33:33] <ezio> brutalhonesty, it's not the scroll bar ... its datatables actual calculation of the table size
[09:34:07] <brutalhonesty> Drager: $("a.tab").one('click', function(e) seemed to work
[09:34:12] <brutalhonesty> http://jsfiddle.net/EcfeR/3/
[09:34:25] <brutalhonesty> ezio: ah i see
[09:34:45] <brutalhonesty> maybe conform it with a css change after its attempted to change the size?
[09:35:07] <Drager> brutalhonesty: Yeah but click on "Preview comment" then "Write" then you cannot press "Preview"
[09:35:32] <djQuery> Draeli, think htis will do it? http://jsfiddle.net/EcfeR/4/
[09:35:47] <djQuery> oops Drager ^^^^
[09:36:29] <brutalhonesty> djQuery: nice!
[09:36:53] <brutalhonesty> Drager: djQuery's link worked for me
[09:36:58] <Drager> Yeah for me as well
[09:37:00] <Drager> Thanks guys!
[09:37:06] <jyx> lulz
[09:37:10] <djQuery> Drager, notice it simplier
[09:38:07] <vacho> guys..I have a programmatic problem
[09:38:12] <brutalhonesty> djQuery: actually needed something like this for a button i had on my site, thanks
[09:38:12] <Drager> djQuery: Yeah, looked nicer as well
[09:38:17] <djQuery> Drager, little refinment
[09:38:18] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/EcfeR/5/
[09:38:25] <vacho> I have 50 forms on a page.. I want to validate only that form upon submit.
[09:38:47] <Drager> djQuery: Alrighty
[09:38:54] <brutalhonesty> vacho: oh man, do you have an example fiddle?
[09:38:54] <djQuery> vacho, does each form have its own submit button?
[09:39:45] <vacho> djQuery: yes they do... I tried doing if !$(".password-field").val().length > 5 ) { alert('password needs to be at least 5 characters'); return false; }
[09:39:51] <vacho> that will not work since it will check all password fields.
[09:40:18] <Drager> vacho: password checking on client-side is a bad idea imo
[09:40:33] <vacho> you are so damn right!
[09:40:38] <vacho> why didn't I think of that?
[09:40:42] <vacho> ok..i'll make it on php end.
[09:40:53] <jyx> why $.lulz() is not working ?
[09:41:55] <systemfault> jyx: Because jQUery isn't funny enough… I guess
[09:42:07] <Drager> vacho: I guess you could do it on the frontend just to make it nicer but dont put it into the database if it doesn't checkout on serverside
[09:42:27] <NoiseEee> vacho: $('#someParentID .password-field')
[09:42:28] <brutalhonesty> vacho: i usually have client side checking on top of server side checking for lengths to prevent unecessary post queries
[09:42:47] <NoiseEee> vacho: or parentElement.find('.password-field')
[09:42:57] <brutalhonesty> but NoiseEee's post here ^ is good, add an id to each password field that uniquely identifies it, and that might help
[09:43:02] <Drager> brutalhonesty: That's a good idea
[09:43:23] <djQuery> $('form').on('submit', function(e){   valid = true; $this = $(this); $errorul = $this.find('.errorul').html(''); }  });
[09:43:46] <djQuery> vacho, and have you looked at a form validation plugin?
[09:43:59] <Gho5t> DJyou just made some global vars
[09:44:08] <Gho5t> * djQuery
[09:44:17] <djQuery> Gho5t, yeah forgot var
[09:44:22] <Gho5t> I am posting this on bash.org
[09:45:48] <jyx> there is a problem on the lulz
[09:45:59] <jyx> i wonder why
[09:47:55] <Gho5t> people love js global vars jokes
[09:50:46] <ezio> Gho5t, an sql query walks into a bar, sits between two tables and says ...
[09:51:37] <Gho5t> "how bout you truncate that drink and we optimize our indexes"
[09:51:41] <Gho5t> ?
[09:51:46] <Gho5t> i just made that up
[09:51:49] <Gho5t> not bad
[09:51:58] <ezio> lol ... the answer is much more simple
[09:52:19] <brutalhonesty> lol
[09:52:19] <systemfault> ezio: Can I join you?
[09:52:25] <ezio> systemfault, lol yes
[09:52:30] <Gho5t> ah nice haha
[09:53:01] <systemfault> Some programmer jokes are funny
[09:53:10] <ezio> xkcd
[09:53:11] <systemfault> There's a thread sometimes on reddit/HN
[09:54:05] <djQuery> this is pretty good info
[09:54:06] <djQuery> http://www.wufoo.com/html5/
[09:54:14] <systemfault> There's that classic… "Why do programmers mix christmas and halloween?" Because dec 25 = oct 31
[09:54:40] <systemfault> djQuery: Do you know caniuse.com?
[09:54:55] <djQuery> systemfault, yeah use that one as well
[09:55:01] <systemfault> Good :)
[09:55:08] <djQuery> systemfault, this one seems to go more indepth on forms
[09:55:28] <rmill> caniuse is on the bot, also. Just sayin'
[09:55:30] <systemfault> Ah ok, I'll bookmark it
[09:55:49] <rmill> `caniuse json video
[09:55:50] <b-ot> rmill: You can use JSON parsing, and Video element with: Internet Explorer 9, Firefox 3.5, Chrome 4, Safari 4, Opera 10.5, iOS Safari 4.0-4.1, and Opera Mobile 11. http://caniuse.com/#search=json, http://caniuse.com/#search=video
[09:56:02] <rmill> OH SHI
[09:56:08] <systemfault> That's sexy
[09:56:29] <rmill> systemfault: NO U
[09:56:35] <systemfault> I often end up writing canisue in my address bar instead of caniuse :(
[09:56:46] <djQuery> `caniuse :valid
[09:56:46] <b-ot> djQuery: Sorry, I can't find anything on :valid
[09:56:51] <pachet> systemfault: that's step 2
[09:57:03] <systemfault> :D
[09:57:12] <rmill> djQuery: I kind of wish it was better at finding the things.
[09:57:12] <rmill> But the API isn't the best.
[09:57:48] <rmill> Works for most of the stuff on caniuse.com, tho
[09:58:02] <rmill> `caniuse blob
[09:58:02] <b-ot> rmill: Sorry, I can't find anything on blob
[09:58:06] <rmill> `caniuse blob-urls
[09:58:07] <b-ot> rmill: You can use Blob URLs with: Internet Explorer 10, Firefox 4, Chrome 8, Safari 6, and iOS Safari 6. http://caniuse.com/#search=bloburls
[09:58:17] <rmill> See, like that should be easier.
[09:59:10] <djQuery> rmill, so many new things in html5
[10:00:08] <systemfault> HTML5 itself is just a few new semantic tags and form helpers :/
[10:01:10] <jyx> u should implement the lulz function
[10:01:24] <jyx> $('da').lulz()
[10:01:38] <systemfault> Wouldn't be too difficult
[10:04:08] <jyx> ok basically the lulz ju
[10:04:13] <jyx> the lulz function just lulz
[10:04:26] <jyx> a recursive infinite algorithm
[10:04:39] <jyx> that spreads the lulz
[10:05:07] <systemfault> jyx: http://jsfiddle.net/7seHe/ Just for you
[10:05:18] <gener1c> how do i get window.scrollY in JQ mobile?
[10:05:53] <jyx> thank you much!
[10:06:03] <systemfault> jyx: You can even do: $('.da').lulz().lulz().lulz(); for extra LOLS
[10:06:09] <jyx> now im able to make my sites lulz all the way!
[10:06:35] <jyx> you rock
[10:07:11] <gener1c> $(window).scrollTop()_
[10:07:13] <gener1c> 10q
[10:08:25] <gener1c> doesnt work :/
[10:10:34] <bluesm> Can I in easy way loop through the several elements Say "$(".form-input")"  ?
[10:10:50] <bluesm> I would like to change classes one after the other...
[10:11:04] <systemfault> bluesm: Most jquery functions work on collection
[10:11:21] <systemfault> $('*').addClass('lol') would add a lol class to ALL elements in the dom
[10:13:03] <bluesm> systemfault: Right. But I would like to "change classes" one after the other -> First element, then after some action second element... And so on...
[10:13:17] <systemfault> bluesm: Then use .each
[10:13:22] <bluesm> systemfault: There is not "next" function ?
[10:13:45] <systemfault> bluesm: $(selector).each(function() { doSomething(); $(this).addClass('lol'); });
[10:14:24] <gener1c> any one?
[10:14:43] <systemfault> gener1c: What do you want to do?
[10:14:44] <gener1c> has an idea on how to use $(window).scrollTop() in mobile?
[10:14:54] <gener1c> i want to make a fixed navbar
[10:14:59] <samkuehn> Having and issue when posting (create) json to a rest api using jquery 1.9.1.  The server responds with a 201 with no response data (location header to indicate url to newly created object).  Howeve,r jquery is fireing and ajaxError a for some reason - it seem jquery is tying to parse the (empty) response as json or something.  Here is what the response headers look like.  http://pastebin.com/6EMWHUg3.  I have successfully done
[10:14:59] <samkuehn>  this in the past with earlier versions of jquery.
[10:15:14] <Wolf_22> If I need to get the width of stuff inside table TD elements, do I need to use an EACH() block?
[10:15:25] <systemfault> gener1c: If you don't need to support iOS5, then you can use CSS's position: fixed
[10:15:36] <gener1c> oh rly
[10:15:50] <samkuehn> the error message that I get is SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input:
[10:15:51] <gener1c> how can i solve it for both?
[10:15:58] <gener1c> useragent sniffing?
[10:16:04] <gener1c> or modernizer?
[10:16:12] <systemfault> gener1c: modernizr would be better
[10:16:16] <gener1c> so i do
[10:16:30] <systemfault> gener1c: But, that won't fix your header :(
[10:16:40] <gener1c> wa?
[10:16:49] <gener1c> id do
[10:16:51] <systemfault> I mean, you still need to get your scrollTop thing working
[10:18:22] <gener1c> if (!fixedposition()){ $(window).bind('scrollstop',function(){ $('.header').css('top',$(window).scrollTop())})}
[10:18:42] <gener1c> wouldnt that work?
[10:19:29] <systemfault> gener1c: is there a scrollstop event?
[10:19:49] <gener1c> yeah
[10:19:53] <gener1c> in jq mobile :)
[10:20:03] <gener1c> its annoying i need to use it lol
[10:20:07] <gener1c> but i have to
[10:20:38] <systemfault> gener1c: I'd be surprised if $(window).scrollTop() returns a string that can be fed directly to .css
[10:20:48] <gener1c> it does
[10:20:48] <systemfault> gener1c: Perhaps you need to add 'px' or something
[10:20:56] <gener1c> ohhhhhhhhhh
[10:21:05] <gener1c> no
[10:21:06] <systemfault> You get what I mean?
[10:21:09] <gener1c> because its top
[10:21:10] <gener1c> not px
[10:21:13] <gener1c> :)
[10:21:25] <systemfault> top still takes pixel..
[10:21:29] <gener1c> it does?
[10:21:30] <gener1c> oi
[10:21:33] <systemfault> (or another unit)
[10:21:41] <gener1c> i remembered otherwise
[10:21:44] <gener1c> ok ill do that
[10:22:09] <systemfault> gener1c: And if it ever works… you probably won't want to use "top"
[10:22:11] <gener1c> maybe that was my issue
[10:25:46] <bluesm> systemfault: What is the difference $(selector).each(function() { $(this).addClass('lol'); });   $(selector).addClass('lol')    ?
[10:25:59] <systemfault> bluesm: None.. .each would be slower.
[10:26:37] <systemfault> bluesm: That's why I told you to simply use .addClass first… Then you said you wanted to do other things on each node beside adding a class
[10:26:46] <systemfault> bluesm: That's why I mentionned .each
[10:26:50] <bluesm> systemfault: Ok. But I have to wait until "user" click to "change this class"
[10:27:05] <systemfault> bluesm: Then add it in a click event handler
[10:27:35] <bluesm> systemfault: And move "$(selector)[i]"  Right ?
[10:27:58] <systemfault> bluesm: Nope, [i] would unwrap the node
[10:28:11] <zoned> anyone know how to tell when videos have been loaded on a page? i think you can use $(video).on("loadedmetadata", callback)   .. but i need to do this for multiple. something like the imagesLoaded plugin, but for videos.
[10:28:27] <gener1c> systemfault: i dont think modernizer checks for position fixed :/
[10:28:36] <systemfault> gener1c: You can add a test.
[10:28:54] <systemfault> Hmm.. you could probably do it without modernizr :/
[10:28:58] <gener1c> how O.o
[10:29:36] <systemfault> Hmm
[10:29:40] <gener1c> googling...
[10:29:48] <systemfault> I wish I had a device close that doesn't support it
[10:30:07] <gener1c> lol
[10:30:20] <gener1c> http://kangax.github.com/cft/#IS_POSITION_FIXED_SUPPORTED
[10:31:01] <slash_nick> Can someone recommend a plugin for handling fixed-width <select> tags with long <option> text in IE versions < 8
[10:31:53] <jaagr> why would you need a plugin for that?
[10:32:19] <zoned> slash_nick: why can't you just do it in css? give the select tag a height
[10:32:33] <systemfault> gener1c: Why is it so complicated… I had http://jsfiddle.net/5MqFk/ in mind
[10:33:05] <slash_nick> zoned: give it a height?  what would that do? i'm googling that train of thought
[10:33:10] <systemfault> (Of course, you'd replace lol with fixed
[10:33:37] <zoned> slash_nick: i assume your problem is that the select width is fixed but your options span multiple lines or something?
[10:33:49] <slash_nick> zoned: yes, my options are longer than the select's width
[10:34:13] <zoned> slash_nick: do they wrap by default? or what happens? 
[10:34:26] <slash_nick> no wrap... they trail off into oblivion
[10:34:54] <slash_nick> IE9+ is no problem... only IE8 and down
[10:35:12] <slash_nick> zoned: ^, apologies
[10:36:05] <slash_nick> The articles I've read indicate jQuery is the way to solve.   Most solutions I've found use $.browser, which is not an option.
[10:36:29] <jaagr> Just replace the select with a custom drop down then?
[10:37:09] <slash_nick> something like chosen or select2? Wonder how well they play with bootstrap
[10:37:16] <gener1c> systemfault:  i got false systemfault and my browser supports it
[10:37:32] <systemfault> systemfault: You replaced lol with fixed I hope..
[10:37:33] <systemfault> Err
[10:37:35] <systemfault> gener1c:
[10:37:37] <jaagr> slash_nick: Are you using twitter's bootstrap?
[10:37:39] <gener1c> meh
[10:37:42] <slash_nick> jaagr: yes I am
[10:37:50] <zoned> slash_nick: and removing the width would cause you a problem?
[10:37:56] <systemfault> gener1c: I used lol to have a false..
[10:38:08] <pythonsnake> hey
[10:38:09] <gener1c> if something is not supported javascript wont set it/?
[10:38:11] <systemfault> gener1c: Because I got a true when setting 'fixed'
[10:38:12] <gener1c> how nice of it to work
[10:38:13] <slash_nick> zoned: then the selects would resize automatically... things would spill out of containers
[10:38:23] <pythonsnake> how's the show/hide button called
[10:38:24] <systemfault> gener1c: Right :)
[10:38:50] <gener1c> usually when i set something in js it works no matter what :P
[10:39:07] <gener1c> the magic of weak dynamic languages
[10:39:13] <systemfault> Magic of the DOM...
[10:39:15] <gener1c> typed*
[10:39:20] <zoned> slash_nick: thats kind of a tough problem.. even a js solution would probably be extremely messy i have a feeling
[10:39:21] <gener1c> yeah the dom is awesome
[10:39:24] <gener1c> i love working with it
[10:39:32] <jaagr> zoned: nah
[10:39:33] <pachet> magic of the dom is a good movie title
[10:39:38] <gener1c> i dont know why all those people at google hate it so much
[10:39:38] <systemfault> The DOM is its own realm… ubound by the rules of Javascript
[10:39:44] <systemfault> *unbound
[10:39:49] <jaagr> then you could just break the text up into multiple lines
[10:39:56] <jaagr> and it would respect the width
[10:39:57] <gener1c> tell that to angular.js
[10:39:59] <pythonsnake>  the show/hide button called with a little arrow near it
[10:40:04] <systemfault> gener1c: verbose…. and doesn't work the same on all browsers
[10:40:23] <gener1c> what is verbose and ...
[10:40:23] <jaagr> well, it would automatically linify (made up word) itself
[10:40:23] <slash_nick> zoned: that's what I was afraid of... I was tempted to just set the "title" attribute (to provide a hover tip with the full option text)
[10:40:34] <gener1c> ah you mean angu
[10:40:49] <jaagr> slash_nick: I don't really see the problem
[10:40:50] <slash_nick> zoned: but I'm using rails, and in many places using a helper to generate my option tags from an array... I don't wanna monkey patch the helper to copy the text to the title attribute
[10:41:02] <systemfault> gener1c: var div = document.createElement('div'); div.appendChild(document.createTextNode('Hello World')); document.body.appendChild(div); // Example of verbosity
[10:41:24] <jaagr> slash_nick: just write a snippet of code that replaces the select and creates a html drop down
[10:41:29] <systemfault> gener1c: You'd do the same with jQuery by doing $('body').append("<div>Hello World</div>');
[10:42:00] <slash_nick> jaagr: that's a good suggestion, thank you
[10:42:15] <jaagr> slash_nick: could you paste your code?
[10:42:30] <jaagr> slash_nick: could help you with the replacement function... a bit bored and want something to do :(
[10:42:43] <gener1c> yeah well you can use jquery with angu..
[10:43:15] <systemfault> gener1c: jQuery is not "pure DOM", it's a abstraction layer on top of it
[10:43:32] <zoned> slash_nick: if (ie8) window.location = "http://google.com/chrome";
[10:43:40] <jaagr> :)
[10:44:06] <slash_nick> zoned: I love that solution... add a note "We don't use antiquated software to build your solution, you should not use antiquated software to access it"
[10:44:11] <gener1c> hot
[10:44:14] <jaagr> if browser != chrome download chrome pls.
[10:44:26] <zoned> safari and firefox are acceptable
[10:44:38] <jaagr> remember when i started web dev... back then everyone wrote: This page is made for XX browser and xxx*xxx resolution
[10:44:43] <jaagr> what happened to that? ;)
[10:45:10] <jaagr> slash_nick: so how about that code? :)
[10:45:46] <zoned> slash_nick: on every website we build here, we add a "browser upgrade" bar which appears if using < ie8 and then we just let whatever issues are going to happen happen. unless the client specifically requests it, and then they pay for it.
[10:46:53] <slash_nick> jaagr: the select's class is "foo"... is that enough to write the replacement snippet? :)
[10:46:59] <jaagr> zoned: we use the same concept at our website.. but we're actually a bit more extreme and redirect the users to a browser recommendations page
[10:47:25] <jaagr> slash_nick: no I need at least one option with content... and it can't be "bar"
[10:47:41] <zoned> jagr we pretty much just use http://browserupdate.org/  but had to modify it so it gets triggered by ie's compatibility mode as well
[10:47:50] <jaagr> yep that's what we use :)
[10:48:22] <jaagr> or no it isn't
[10:48:23] <slash_nick> sorry multi-multitasking
[10:48:31] <zoned> jaagr: which do you use?
[10:48:47] <jaagr> browsehappy.com
[10:48:52] <jaagr> since it's well localized
[10:49:13] <jaagr> maybe browserupdate is as well - dunno :)
[10:49:39] <jaagr> slash_nick: writing your own? or can I get to it?:)
[10:50:47] <didiergm> hi, is there a way to know in jqm that the user has tried to scroll past the end of a table. The intention would be to populated the table small chunks at a time
[10:50:55] <slash_nick> one sec I'll grab it from page source
[10:51:53] <jaagr> zoned: we have a few million users in russia and it's quite funny that opera has an insane amount of % users that is using Opera over there.. Where I'm from (Sweden) it's quite underground with opera
[10:52:01] <jaagr> funny how it's so different :)
[10:53:13] <jaagr> slash_nick: I was kidding about the "bar" thing... just wanted to know if you're doing it or not :)
[10:53:31] <jaagr> no need for me to code then
[10:53:32] <zoned> jaagr: the US is pretty underground with opera as well. that is interesting
[10:54:05] <mhn23> can nobody tell me how i tell modernizr to load a script only above max-width 768px?
[10:54:26] <jaagr> zoned: yeah.. not sure about the exact number but iirc it's above 80% using opera in rus
[10:54:28] <mhn23> not quite understanding the mq syntax

[10:55:18] <bluesm> systemfault: Oh. I see. Is there a method that wouldn't unwrap  it ? ---> $(selector)[i]
[10:55:51] <bluesm> systemfault:  http://jsfiddle.net/J39J5/1/
[10:55:58] <systemfault> bluesm: .eq(i)
[10:55:58] <slash_nick> jaagr: would you need to know the desired width of the select box, or can you just assume something like 10px
[10:56:24] <jaagr> slash_nick: I'll assume that you will set that width using css :)
[10:56:39] <pythonsnake> how's the show/hide button called
[10:56:41] <pythonsnake>  the show/hide button called with a little arrow near it
[10:56:46] <pythonsnake> like 'show more'
[10:58:29] <bluesm> systemfault: Thank you very very much :]
[10:59:03] <bluesm> systemfault: All I was asking. If jquery enables any magic to make this : http://jsfiddle.net/J39J5/3/   looping easier :)
[10:59:30] <jaagr> slash_nick: ok, new beer and I'ma get working... will be done in prolly 5 mins
[11:00:09] <systemfault> bluesm: perhaps you could use .next()
[11:00:35] <bluesm> systemfault:  But Only when there are siblings. Right ?
[11:00:43] <systemfault> bluesm: Right
[11:01:10] <bluesm> systemfault: Ok. Thank you very very much for your time :]
[11:01:19] <systemfault> bluesm: Well.. you could use .parents('selector').next()
[11:01:24] <systemfault> You're welcome
[11:01:57] <slash_nick> jaagr: appreciated... glad you're bored, hope this helps
[11:08:14] <jaagr> slash_nick: Twitter's bootstrap will be available for this dropdown right?
[11:09:37] <slash_nick> jaagr: yessir
[11:12:55] <didiergm> how would you go to progressiveluy populate a table as the user requests it by scrolling to the bottom of the table ?
[11:14:46] <slash_nick> didiergm: google for jquery waypoints ... the endless page plugin might give you ideas
[11:15:45] <didiergm> slash_nick thanks for the pointer, I'll give it a go cheers
[11:18:15] <skope> hello. why e.preventDefault() doesn't work with this? https://gist.github.com/skopetsi/f6558dc3eb7ac81768c5
[11:19:32] <bil`> Is there an easy way to trim a number like 24.550898203592812 to at most 1 decimal place, but if the decimal is 0 then just have the whole number?
[11:19:50] <bil`> er meant to ask that in #javascript
[11:19:52] <systemfault> skope: You need to add the form to the page before
[11:20:17] <systemfault> ?js var x = 24.550898203592812; x.toFixed(2);
[11:20:24] <bot-t> systemfault: No output. (Process Killed)
[11:20:28] <systemfault> ....
[11:20:37] <systemfault> ?js var x = 24.550898203592812; x.toFixed(2);
[11:20:38] <bot-t> systemfault: "24.55"
[11:20:41] <systemfault> THANKS.
[11:20:57] <systemfault> bil`: Is .toFixed enough?
[11:20:59] <skope> systemfault: it is added dynamically on click. but apparently anchors work only for elements which are already present when the page is rendered. so i have to make something like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8867194/jquery-on-not-working-with-dynamic-dom-html
[11:21:51] <Haprog> skope: not really. you can just bind the submit handler right after adding the content for example.
[11:22:12] <systemfault> I don't know if the submit even bubbles...
[11:22:24] <skope> Haprog: how would i do that?
[11:22:26] <bureq> hi, can anyone help me with this? It's supposed to scrollto anchors: http://jsfiddle.net/9SDLw/549/
[11:22:36] <Haprog> skope: move the lines 13-18 inside the link-upload click at the end right after the modalbox call
[11:23:03] <systemfault> If so: change $('#upload-form').submit(function(e) { to $(document).on('submit', '#upload-form', function(e) { 
[11:23:34] <systemfault> (If the submit event supports bubbling then you can use the line above)
[11:23:54] <Haprog> skope: or maybe keet the form in HTML from the beginning (hidden with css display:none) and then only show it when needed
[11:23:58] <Haprog> *keep
[11:24:12] <skope> Haprog: i have so many modal boxes that code gets messy and hard to read
[11:24:24] <Haprog> well there are many ways
[11:25:33] <bluesm> systemfault: .parents('selector').next()  ? Why parents ?
[11:25:56] <systemfault> bluesm: To go up X levels until the selector is matched
[11:26:22] <systemfault> bluesm: If you don't want it to work ONLY with siblings
[11:26:30] <skope> Haprog: that first advise helped. thanks
[11:26:38] <Haprog> np
[11:26:48] <bluesm>  systemfault: In case of elements aren't siblings ?
[11:27:13] <systemfault> bluesm: Use .closest or .parents to go up X levels in the tree then use next
[11:27:13] <t0th_-> hi
[11:27:22] <t0th_-> i have this line $("#status option:selected").attr('disabled','disabled');
[11:27:24] <systemfault> bluesm: It really depends on what you need to do.
[11:27:28] <t0th_-> how i can disable the index 0 of select?
[11:27:34] <t0th_-> or index 2
[11:28:08] <jaagr> slash_nick: jsfiddle sucks when you want to be fast lol
[11:28:18] <jaagr> quick*
[11:28:27] <systemfault> t0th_- I'd be tempted to try $('#status').children().eq(0).prop('disabled', true);
[11:28:39] <t0th_-> thanks
[11:30:23] <bureq> can anyone take a look at this please, i cant figure out why it's not working http://jsfiddle.net/9SDLw/559/
[11:30:28] <t0th_-> not work
[11:30:46] <bluesm> systemfault:  I will stick with min way. Because I could easily find the end -->  if(actual_pos != end)
[11:31:28] <t0th_-> i have this line $("#status option:selected").attr('disabled','disabled');
[11:31:32] <t0th_-> how i can disable the index 0 of select? or index 2?
[11:31:47] <jaagr> ppl who use jsfiddle alot... where do I see the error output?
[11:31:49] <systemfault> bluesm: :)
[11:32:19] <NoiseEee> jaagr: either in your console, or you can choose "jquery edge" which will let you include a console on the output screen by checking "firebug lite"
[11:32:31] <jaagr> NoiseEee: ok thanks mate
[11:33:31] <jaagr> Didn't think jsfiddle threw stuff into my console log... was funny when I saw 4+ "asd is not defined".... random chars in the code != good
[11:33:34] <slash_nick> jaagr: thanks... there should be a way for us to buy beers for folks on here
[11:33:35] <t0th_-> http://jsfiddle.net/52ntG/
[11:34:11] <Zzaichik> bureq: it's doing exactly what it should - you shouldn't have multiple of the same id's.
[11:35:04] <t0th_-> any?
[11:35:22] <velts> does anyone know why this regex ^((\w+([-+.']\w+)*@\w+([-.]\w+)*\.\w+([-.]\w+)*)*([,])*)*$ fails with i do: a@b.com, c@d.com
[11:36:01] <Segaja> interesting js question
[11:36:09] <velts> pretty sure its the space after the comma... just wondering if there is anyway to allow for a space or should i just delete the space if a user types it
[11:36:14] <t0th_-> :(
[11:36:21] <Segaja> trying to match email addresses are we?
[11:36:32] <bureq> Zzaichik: thanks, but looks like thats not the only problem
[11:36:32] <velts> comma seperated email addresses
[11:36:41] <jaagr> slash_nick: I'ma come over the the states and we'll grab that beer!
[11:36:49] <Segaja> velts: include a \s where you match the ,
[11:37:08] <velts> before or after the ,
[11:37:45] <t0th_-> $("#status option:eq(1)").attr('disabled','disabled');
[11:38:41] <velts> Segaja: worked!
[11:38:42] <Zzaichik> well, bureq, I disagree.
[11:38:43] <velts> thanks
[11:39:29] <Zzaichik> bureq: http://jsfiddle.net/9SDLw/564/
[11:42:33] <bureq> Zzaichik: thanks! Wish I knew whats going on there.
[11:44:38] <jaagr> slash_nick: done btw
[11:44:57] <slash_nick> awesome, you're a saint
[11:48:23] <Zzaichik> @bureq you were telling the click event to scroll to the matching id, but that <a> that you were clicking on also had it's own matching id and href. I changed the href and then the matching content's id to match.
[11:48:31] <Zzaichik> ¿esta bien?
[11:50:04] <slash_nick> jaagr: can you link to it? :)
[11:53:55] <jaagr> slash_nick: http://jsfiddle.net/LBtDu/6/
[11:55:35] <jaagr> slash_nick: as a note... I haven't tried this in any browsers except Chrome (latest)
[11:55:48] <jaagr> but I don't see why it wouldn't work...
[11:56:01] <jaagr> go ahead and try it in the browsers you want to support
[11:56:17] <jaagr> s/Chrome/Chromium
[11:57:10] <slash_nick> jaagr: I'm about to try it on a VM, IE8
[11:57:17] <veQue> anyone successfully set up a local mail server for testing?
[11:57:24] <jaagr> veQue: yes
[11:57:30] <jaagr> slash_nick: Ok, do that
[11:57:54] <jaagr> slash_nick: I made it for bootstrap - and I know it support ie8 so shouldn't be any probs
[11:58:10] <veQue> didnt expect to see you hehe
[11:58:38] <jaagr> slash_nick: well... made and made.. i created the dropdown in the bootstrap structure (with classes etc)
[11:58:47] <veQue> been staring at tuts
[11:58:53] <jaagr> veQue: what OS are you using?
[11:59:01] <veQue> win 7
[11:59:23] <jaagr> ok, then I'm probably not the best person to help ya out :P I'm an archlinux user
[11:59:42] <veQue> ahh
[11:59:56] <jaagr> guess you've been googling?
[12:00:09] <veQue> well if i figure it out i'll write a tut
[12:00:22] <veQue> yep
[12:00:29] <jaagr> it's probably easier than you think
[12:00:41] <veQue> maybe
[12:00:46] <jaagr> got win 7 up on my laptop so let me go for it
[12:01:26] <jaagr> btw.. why doesn't it work for ya?
[12:02:44] <veQue> i traded in one error for another
[12:02:54] <veQue> kinda lost now

[12:03:42] <veQue> i already changed values in my php
[12:03:54] <veQue> no idea
[12:04:07] <veQue> my apologies

[12:04:25] <veQue> yep
[12:04:59] <jaagr> a hint: have you setup your php.ini ?
[12:05:24] <jaagr> hint + question combined... that's weird

[12:07:04] <jaagr> Or what lib are you using?
[12:07:23] <NoiseEee> veQue: you need to take this issue out of #jquery, perhaps to ##php
[12:07:39] <veQue> not yet looking into hmailserver
[12:07:51] <veQue> NoiseEee: ok
[12:07:59] <jaagr> Yeah it has nothing to do with jQuery but pm me and I can help ya out
[12:13:05] <bluesm> Is there tutorial that teaches jquery by source code of this library ?
[12:15:56] <systemfault> bluesm: You mean?
[12:16:21] <systemfault> The only online tutorial I know is "jQuery fundamentals"
[12:16:25] <jaagr> slash_nick: so...? :)
[12:16:54] <jaagr> slash_nick: as I said... I'm curious
[12:18:18] <slash_nick> jaagr: sorry, I get pulled all over the place here
[12:19:03] <jaagr> slash_nick: ok... :)
[12:19:59] <basiclaser> hey guys i want to make a drawing app for smartphones, is there an opensource API that everyone goes to for selecting colours and brushes or is it something i have to build from scatch?
[12:20:14] <slash_nick> I threw it on the page, but it doesn't appear to be erroring or functioning...  give me a few more
[12:20:43] <jaagr> slash_nick: lol that's a broad statement
[12:21:26] <slash_nick> Doh lol... for one, the id is a timestamp
[12:21:45] <jaagr> basiclaser: If you know how to build a drawing app you probably now how to make your own palette selections
[12:22:02] <jaagr> slash_nick: then just change that stuff :)
[12:22:02] <basiclaser> jaagr: i am very much a noob
[12:22:17] <jaagr> basiclaser: then start with something more simple
[12:22:25] <basiclaser> ok thanks :)
[12:22:53] * jaagr was expecting a bit more rage ;)
[12:23:14] <bluesm> systemfault: I mean tutorial that explain every method and design of jquery by showing source code :]
[12:23:29] <systemfault> bluesm: Ah, not that I know :/
[12:23:32] <bluesm> systemfault: Source code of jquery itself.
[12:23:36] <jaagr> slash_nick: for the <select> selector I just entered the ID you gave me... change it to whatever
[12:23:40] <bluesm> systemfault: Ok. Thanks :]
[12:23:56] <slash_nick> yup yup... jaagr question, what if I used $("select")... would I need to modify the code to iterate over the matches?
[12:24:38] <jaagr> slash_nick: No, go ahead and use that... then it would replace all <select>'s
[12:24:58] <jaagr> slash_nick: or wait
[12:25:20] <slash_nick> jaagr: and put them all in the same dropdown? :)
[12:25:43] <jaagr> slash_nick: explain to me how you want it
[12:26:42] <jaagr> slash_nick: Do you want to put the options of all selects in the same drop downs?
[12:27:04] <slash_nick> jaagr: no that would be bad :)
[12:27:11] <jaagr> Or do you want to make 1 html select drop down for each select box (as I guess you do)
[12:27:21] <slash_nick> jaagr: that's what I'm after
[12:27:32] <jaagr> slash_nick: ok let me change some code then
[12:27:39] <jaagr> because now it will only go for 1 select
[12:28:02] <jaagr> <please hold> as they say in annoying phone lines
[12:38:45] <sedeki> hello all, i've bought a design and I wish to have the same noty notification as the example. I want to run it in javascript when the DOM is loaded, however the example is a button. Looks like this: <button class="btn btn-primary noty" data-noty-options='{"text":"This is a success information","layout":"top","type":"information"}'>
[12:39:05] <sedeki> how should I call this in js to have the same notification?
[12:42:54] <sedeki> firebug also tells me "TypeError: noty is not a function" when I have it inside a $(document).ready(function(){ .. }. But when I run it in the console it works
[12:43:13] <jaagr> slash_nick: you there?
[12:45:06] <jaagr> slash_nick: well... I'm done, so tell me when you're here
[12:46:14] <slash_nick> sorry, was paged up a bit
[12:46:23] <slash_nick> jaagr: i'm around :)
[12:47:09] <jaagr> ok, made the code applicable for multiple selects
[12:47:36] <slash_nick> again, saintly...
[12:49:11] <jaagr> slash_nick: http://jsfiddle.net/LBtDu/12/
[12:49:33] <slash_nick> throwing it in there now
[12:49:46] <jaagr> slash_nick: throwing what in where? :)
[12:50:03] <jaagr> you mean the code into ie8? :P
[12:50:58] <jaagr> this channel is so quite compared to #archlinux
[12:51:33] <slash_nick> that's right... next I need to get it scrolling, and tie it up using .on so it applies to asynch-loaded elements
[12:51:51] <veQue> thanks again jaagr it worked
[12:51:53] <jaagr> slash_nick: that's easy mode
[12:52:15] <jaagr> veQue: cool
[12:52:23] <slash_nick> jaagr: alright then, I'll handle that bit then...  Can't thank you enough.
[12:52:30] * slash_nick kicks IE in the balls with jaagr's foot.
[12:52:54] <jaagr> slash_nick: still curious... how did the html select work out in the <non supporting> browsers?
[12:54:19] <slash_nick> beautifully :)
[12:54:33] <slash_nick> Thinking of applying this replacement script whether it's IE or not
[12:54:57] <jaagr> slash_nick: I'd recommend doing it for all browsers
[12:55:42] <StephenS> on certain delay, comet does not respond for about 5 seconds
[12:55:44] <StephenS> why is that?
[12:55:55] <slash_nick> yeah, could lead to troubleshooting nightmares - different versions of the same stuff
[12:55:58] <boytoy> Hey
[12:56:07] <StephenS> Lets say I have active chat, nd then dont send antyhnig for 10 mins, after i send msg I have delay 5 seconds.. why is that
[12:56:12] <zoned> look, i can code like @fat this.$el.append(this.template({filters: _.uniq(_.flatten(_.map(this.collection.pluck("types"), function(t) { return t.split(" "); }) ))})).fadeIn("fast");
[12:56:22] <jaagr> slash_nick: I don't know what kind of site you are developing but personally I prefer to make it "equal" for all browsers as much as possible
[12:56:45] <boytoy> So now that everybody's porting their mobile designs over to desktop, how do you guys feel about using jQuery Mobile for desktop? Such as sliding between different pages, dialogs etc.?
[12:56:57] <jaagr> slash_nick: how come?
[12:57:19] <slash_nick> jaagr: different versions, I mean...
[12:57:41] <jaagr> slash_nick: still don't get what you mean... ;)
[12:57:57] <jaagr> slash_nick: versioned using git or what?
[12:58:21] <slash_nick> jaagr: I mean the actual experience would vary between browsers
[12:58:32] <slash_nick> that's all :)
[12:58:54] <jaagr> slash_nick: well... this solution would be the same for everyone
[12:59:00] <slash_nick> One more change I intend to make, jaagr...   I'd like to take each select's closest label text and use it for the dropdown's default text
[12:59:41] <jaagr> slash_nick: You know how to make that? Otherwise I'll change the code to grab that
[13:00:28] <slash_nick> jaagr: I'm interested to see how you'd do it... I can imagine doing $(this).closest("div").find("label").text() or something
[13:00:53] <jaagr> slash_nick: almost something like that :)
[13:01:03] <jaagr> slash_nick: wouldn't grab the div first tho
[13:01:13] <slash_nick> $(this).closest("label") ?
[13:01:20] <jaagr> slash_nick: ye
[13:01:42] <StephenS> any help for me?
[13:01:55] <slash_nick> jaagr: thanks a lot...
[13:05:38] <slash_nick> jaagr: I'm also changing the newElement variable to a function so I can pass in the desired text
[13:06:21] <jaagr> slash_nick: go ahead :)
[13:07:03] <jaagr> slash_nick: the newElement variable in my code was only a var to hold the template for the replacement drop down
[13:11:33] <jaagr> slash_nick: did you check that the "html drop down" also reflected the <select> ?
[13:12:03] <slash_nick> jaagr: reflected?
[13:13:28] <jaagr> well in the code I sent you, you could see the "original" select-box and the "new" html drop down
[13:14:09] <[fields]> I'm having the weirdest issue with a jquery autocomplete... the list appears, and I can select one, but it stays frozen on the one selected and does not populate the text input, even though typing in the text input started the autocomplete.
[13:14:29] <[fields]> i've spent a couple days now scratching my head over why this autocomplete does not complete
[13:14:40] <jaagr> and when you selected something in the new "drop down" it "reflects" the changes and updates the original select input
[13:15:20] <[fields]> i've copied the code I'm using to a fiddle and it works fine as a fiddle
[13:15:43] <[fields]> actually in my application, it works fine one place, but not at another.
[13:15:53] <jaagr> slash_nick: because if it doesn't update the original <select> it won't work
[13:18:59] <slash_nick> jaagr: that is working
[13:20:35] <zoned> I'm using $(video).on("loadedmetadata", …. ) to see when a video has been loaded. this works great the first time, but after a video has already been loaded, if i call it again, i would expect it to just return instantly? instead, it never returns.
[13:22:35] <jaagr> slash_nick: tried IE8 as well?
[13:23:17] <jaagr> slash_nick: it _should_ work in IE6+
[13:27:09] <jaagr> zoned: well isn't it already loaded then?
[13:27:19] <zoned> jaagr: it is… but how can i tell?
[13:28:04] <dhci> there is a standard line $inputs.prop("disabled", true); that is blowing up my javascript but it seems to work in my other samples do you think something is malformed about my form? i have it nested between a table but i don't think that would make a difference, unless it has to do with how the tags are collected
[13:28:31] <[fields]> dhci:  yes, that does matter
[13:28:58] * jaagr think it was tooooo much to read
[13:29:00] <[fields]> dhci:  <table><form><tr><td> Name: <input type="text"...> </td></tr></form></table> - is not the way
[13:29:18] <velts> if you have a string like the following: a@b.com, c@d.com e@f.com how would you make that a@b.com, c@d.com, e@f.com
[13:29:33] <dhci> yeah I had the form on the outside but maybe i'll just manually lay it out without the table all together
[13:29:40] <dhci> will have to see if taking out the table cures this. thanks
[13:30:11] <jaagr> velts: var.split(',')
[13:30:25] <zoned> dhci: if you remove this line of code from your app, and call it in the console instead, does it still "blow up" ?
[13:30:29] <[fields]> velts:  split on the comma, trim each piece, search each piece for a space, if a space is found then replace it to a comma
[13:31:16] <zoned> jaagr: maybe a better way to phrase it would be, how can i tell if a video's already been loaded?
[13:31:28] <dhci> zoned: what do you mean by calling it in the console, do you mean outputting its result there as a string? the line itself was a no-go for the page-reload it really stopped things short
[13:31:35] <jaagr> zoned: not sure... but you only added one event (loadedmetadata) to your obj. If I were you I'd check up the other events
[13:31:49] <velts> [fields]: hmm
[13:32:15] <velts> will give it a shot
[13:32:27] <zoned> dhci: you can execute javascript in the console
[13:32:46] <dhci> zoned ok i see it has a little repl then >>> nice
[13:32:48] <jaagr> zoned: the event you binded to the object makes sense that it would only fire when it is loaded
[13:33:00] <dhci> learning things all the time. going to take out this form/table mixture, thanks again.
[13:33:11] <jaagr> zoned: s/bad english/good english
[13:33:21] <zoned> lol
[13:34:26] <jaagr> slash_nick: still curious.. how's it going? ;)
[13:35:19] <velts> [fields]: is there anyway to not have to decontruct string and then rebuild it?
[13:35:28] <boytoy> having used jqmobile's dialog for dialogs on my mobile site.. should i just use them on desktop as well or use one of those million jquery lightbox plugins?
[13:37:16] <slash_nick> jaagr: not all selects have labels... in some cases I used <dl><dt>Label Here</dt><dd><select>...</select></dd></dl>...  That said, abandoned putting the label in the dropdown as default text
[13:37:27] <lucasicf1> if i add an element to the HTML and right after try to find it with $('selector'), i cannot find it, like the DOM tree is outdated. is there a way i can solve this issue? i cannot bind the new element to a variable, because the function which adds the element cannot be modified.
[13:38:29] <jaagr> slash_nick: add an optional statement
[13:38:44] <jaagr> slash_nick: would you mind sharing the final code?
[13:38:51] <jaagr> as I said... curious :)
[13:39:05] <slash_nick> jaagr: not at all...  but any changes I've made have been promptly undone :\ lol
[13:39:14] <[fields]> velts:  I don't think so
[13:39:42] <sasogeek> hi
[13:39:50] <[fields]> fields, unless you know how to do a regular expression to replace spaces without commas before them to a comma then a space
[13:40:08] <sasogeek> i'm new here :)
[13:40:13] <jaagr> slash_nick: is the site you're developing live? :)
[13:40:18] <[fields]> ah, I'm talking to myself, that was aimed at velts
[13:40:20] <sasogeek> and i need help :P
[13:40:35] <sasogeek> i want to know how to create link previews....
[13:40:56] <jaagr> sasogeek: link previews?
[13:41:11] <[fields]> sasogeek:  find a service that produces thumbnails of a website and utilize that to load a "preview" onmouseover of your link
[13:41:15] <sasogeek> so that if i put a link in a textarea, i get a small thumbnail and a little description or text from the page at the link...
[13:41:18] <jaagr> sasogeek: explain your issue a bit more, s'il vous plait - as they say in france
[13:41:42] <sasogeek> like on facebook or google+
[13:41:45] <Mottie> sasogeek: look for "tooltips" on google
[13:41:55] <jaagr> +1
[13:42:01] <sasogeek> i know what tooltips are, i'm not asking for that :/
[13:42:11] <Mottie> that's what you're describing
[13:42:16] <jaagr> but you're looking for a tooltip?
[13:42:39] <sasogeek> take google+ for example, if i put a link in the update textarea, and hit post, the posted status appears as a thumbnail and some text
[13:43:20] <Mottie> sasogeek: http://jquerytools.org/demos/tooltip/any-html.html
[13:43:21] <jaagr> a preview of a specified url ?
[13:43:22] <slash_nick> jaagr: no it's not live... about a week from it
[13:43:42] <slash_nick> jaagr: also, it will likely be accessible only from Nevada's nursing homes
[13:43:50] <jaagr> slash_nick: ah I see... How did it work out with the html selects tho? :)
[13:43:56] <sasogeek> something like this http://embed.ly/docs/tutorials/jquery_preview
[13:44:16] <sasogeek> i can't use embedly's method because i need a starter plan but i can't purchase it
[13:44:44] <jaagr> write your own?
[13:44:49] <slash_nick> so far so good... jaagr, in many cases changing the select value prompts loading of a subsequent select... (if patient has broken bones, the user can add bone after bone until he's done...)
[13:45:13] <slash_nick> jaagr: do hidden fields trigger .change events?
[13:45:18] <slash_nick> if not I'll have to trigger it manually
[13:45:30] <sasogeek> i'm a jquery noob, and js for that matter, but i need that functionality asap for a project
[13:46:23] <jaagr> slash_nick: well for the snippet of code I wrote it won't trigger change events of hidden fields... but of course you can trigger it... not sure why you would want to tho :)
[13:47:07] <slash_nick> jaagr: changing the select from "" value to some value grabs a second select...
[13:47:17] <[fields]> sasogeek:  learn how to place a div below your textarea, onkeyup of your textarea look for the pattern of an URL, when found write information about that URL in the div below.
[13:47:25] <[fields]> sasogeek:  I believe you underestimate the work involved
[13:47:31] <jaagr> slash_nick: I mean.. 99% of the time it's the service that changes the value of a hidden field.. and then it would be the service (i expect it would be you in this case) that does something whenever it happens
[13:48:01] <Wolfed> Anyone happens to have a small example of how to call autocomplete on a dom-added content? or whatever thats called :P
[13:48:06] <jaagr> slash_nick: what do you mean with that? I don't understand :P
[13:48:10] <Wolfed> jqueryui's autocomplete
[13:48:45] <grafi> have you tried the jquery ui site?
[13:48:56] <Wolfed> Yes
[13:49:00] <[fields]> sasogeek:  I did it recently and performed server-side scraping to get meta title/description or first paragraph.
[13:49:32] <slash_nick> Wolfed: you need to use .on along with the focus event... the autocomplete element will need to be bound on focus
[13:49:33] <[fields]> Wolfed:  after you add the content, you connect the DOM element with the array
[13:49:45] <dzine> can someone recommend me a good modal popup plugin?
[13:49:45] <sasogeek> i can do server side scraping with python which i do already because i'm building a search engine alongside the main project
[13:49:57] <[fields]> dzine:  jqueryui
[13:50:15] <Wolfed> I tried that slash_nick, couldnt pull it off
[13:50:25] <Wolfed> on focus, onkeydown, onclick
[13:50:34] <[fields]> sasogeek:  cool, then you know how to pass strings by ajax?
[13:50:36] <sasogeek> to get the meta description though... not all sites have that meta data... i for instance hardly put meta data in my code
[13:50:56] <sasogeek> [fields] no
[13:51:26] <slash_nick> jaagr: Sorry.. hard to explain without more context.  Patients can have broken bones... You don't have to add one broken bone at a time.  You select "Hip" from the drop down, and my app gives you another select box... you select "Arm", and my app gives you another select box... etc... when you submit, I create a row in my database for Hip, for Arm, for etc....
[13:51:30] <[fields]> sasogeek:  study up on $.get
[13:51:37] <Wolfed> Oh I think I missed something
[13:52:01] <sasogeek> hmmm
[13:52:24] <slash_nick> jaagr: that's why the id's for the select box was timestamped... they get dynamically added.  if you use the empty one, you get a new empty one.
[13:55:04] <guideX> is there a way to stop a jquery/javascript/css menu from being used while you are about to navigate to a new page?
[13:55:06] <jaagr> slash_nick: oh I see... if you want the <select> to <html drop down> made dynamically it's no probs as well... or did you find a way to get it working?
[13:56:23] <Wolfed> Nope, that didnt work out
[13:56:40] <slash_nick> not yet jaagr
[13:57:33] <jaagr> slash_nick: got the back-end for it sorted out?
[13:58:25] <slash_nick> jaagr: yeah, it all worked prior to the IE7/8 hiccup
[13:58:32] <slash_nick> Now I'm diving down a rabbit hole
[13:59:14] <slash_nick> I KNOW those doing acceptance testing aren't using IE7... because that is far from functional
[13:59:15] <jaagr> well if the back end's all good it shouldn't be a problem to get the front end working for IE6+
[13:59:59] <jaagr> Is it possible for you to post the front end stuff that doesn't work?
[14:00:27] <slash_nick> jaagr: let me get it together in a gist
[14:00:40] <jaagr> cool
[14:03:23] <Wolfed> This is what I have: http://jsfiddle.net/qgUds/
[14:03:44] <Wolfed> Tried with both .focus(function()... and .on('focus, this, function()...
[14:03:48] <Wolfed> Neither one of those worked out
[14:04:05] <slash_nick> jaagr: https://gist.github.com/rthbound/7252d7cca815d0d05477 ...
[14:05:41] <slash_nick> jaagr: oops, I've added the script you've provided https://gist.github.com/rthbound/7252d7cca815d0d05477
[14:07:43] <Wolfed> Oh I got a workaround
[14:07:43] <Wolfed> :D
[14:18:19] <unstable> http://pastebin.com/T4QNEgH8
[14:18:40] <unstable> Is there a better way to do what i'm doing? a sortable image stack. The ninja can get swapped with the cat.
[14:19:49] <unstable> a cleaner way
[14:20:49] <NoiseEee> unstable: god yes
[14:21:50] <unstable> NoiseEee: How?
[14:23:33] <jaagr> slash_nick: I'm getting a bit slow at the moment but I'll keep your gist and I'll check it out tomorrow
[14:23:45] <unstable> With a ternary?
[14:23:55] <vacho> with twitter boostrap, can I have two different modals on the same page? :)
[14:24:02] <pachet> unstable: delegate the behavior
[14:24:04] <pachet> one click handler
[14:24:19] <pachet> determine which index was clicked, do the appropriate stuff based on that number
[14:25:00] <jaagr> slash_nick: but one thing... you shouldn't need to wrap that closure (the select replacement) in a $(document).ready(fn);
[14:25:09] <pachet> NoiseEee might be typing up something to that effect right now, if not i'll give you an example in a minute
[14:25:29] <jaagr> vacho: yes
[14:25:30] <NoiseEee> i was and hten i got distracted one sec
[14:25:35] <slash_nick> jaagr: I understand... I'll come on back then. Thanks, that's my inexperience showing.  I can make it work, but I've never had much guidance on the client side
[14:26:30] <jaagr> slash_nick: If you will stay in #jquery I will talk to you tomorrow
[14:26:49] <slash_nick> Alright, will do
[14:27:06] <jaagr> slash_nick: otherwise  I'll msg my mail... I'm really curious about this project
[14:27:43] <slash_nick> jaagr: I will return... also, feel free to msg me
[14:28:14] <NoiseEee> unstable: sorry, i just got busy.  in general, the approach from lines 13-> @ http://pastebin.com/Kkes9cCn
[14:28:40] <NoiseEee> unstable: er http://pastebin.com/xMM0NWqy
[14:32:37] <sasogeek> found a way out... https://github.com/Ekito/bootstrap-linkpreview
[14:33:02] <sasogeek> this will make it all easy as i'm already using the required dependencies
[14:34:53] <pachet> unstable: really you can avoid munging numbers altogether, now that i look at your code more closely:
[14:34:56] <pachet> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5120466
[14:39:24] <didiergm> slash_nick: jumping in but in your gist you are loading jquery.js and jquery-1.8.3.js if jquery is a more current version of JQM, you may be running into trouble; just a thought
[14:40:06] <unstable> pachet: So that is still sortable, but on click it doesn't swap the image ame.
[14:40:08] <unstable> name*
[14:41:31] <pachet> unstable: image name? you mean the src property?
[14:41:51] <pachet> unstable: oh duh, my bad
[14:41:54] <unstable> yes
[14:41:58] <pachet> i have the handler delegated to 'li'
[14:42:01] <pachet> just change that to 'img'
[14:42:17] <unstable> awesome
[14:42:26] <unstable> Thanks pachet, I appreciate the help.
[14:42:41] <unstable> I think this will help me, I haven't seen a ternary before, it makes sense.
[14:42:41] <pachet> no sweat!
[14:42:50] <unstable> ternary in jquery that is.
[14:43:03] <pachet> yeah, they're definitely a matter of preference
[14:43:16] <pachet> if its easier for you to look at if () else () then go with that
[14:43:31] <unstable> no, I like the ternary.
[14:43:43] <pachet> tbh i'm not even sure whether its less expensive to do the ternary than to just replace both cases anyway
[14:43:59] <pachet> wait--scrap that
[14:44:02] <pachet> its friday and im tired
[14:44:09] <pachet> yeah just keep the ternary XD
[14:48:48] <djQuery> how can I do $('element').on('focus click', 'someselector', function(){});
[14:50:07] <say2joe> var eHandler = funciton(){}; $('element').on('focus','selector',eHandler).on('click','selector',eHandler); … or, use an object as the argument to on();
[14:50:11] <djQuery> nm got it
[14:50:38] <pachet> say2joe++
[14:50:42] <pachet> the arg object is sexy
[14:50:46] <djQuery> dang jquery mobile doesn't call pagebeforeshow for 1st page
[15:09:54] <PhantomPhreak53> I am using jquery w/ jquery-ui and using the datepicker function. How do I repeat it to multiple fields. All the fields are named start[]. It only works on the first field
[15:13:38] <[fields]> PhantomPhreak53: don't name your fields by the same name
[15:45:20] <motka> I am looking for a dude named shoky
[15:46:16] <shiftins> sounds like the start of an adventure
[15:47:33] <H2N3> adventures on IRC with motka.
[15:47:39] <H2N3> sounds so interesting.
[15:48:31] <H2N3> myabe they'll make a movie like they will with John Macafee
[15:48:51] <motka> you are a smart guy
[15:49:05] <motka> help a smarter guy with sequental javascript afterloading into the DOM instance
[15:49:16] <motka> using pure-javascript, without jQuery
[15:50:02] <H2N3> wut are u trying to do?
[15:50:19] <H2N3> add javascript after dom is loaded?
[15:50:27] <shoky> ey motka
[15:50:35] <H2N3> check dom ready and readystate.
[15:50:51] <H2N3> ie10 will fire both events
[15:52:20] <motka> nevermind that h2n3
[15:52:32] <motka> sequential event triggering is what matters there
[16:04:50] <dshap> Hey all - I need to know when a bunch of <object>'s containing SVG images on my page are done loading.  How might I go about doing this with jQuery?  I noticed the load() function is deprecated in 1.8
[16:18:42] <toxz> can someone explain this line to me?   var entries = feed.entry || [];
[16:18:56] <toxz> what does the "or" do here?
[16:19:10] <tw2113> if feed.entry returns nothing, it goes to the []
[16:19:11] <shanejonas> if feed.entry doesnt exist.. it sets entries to be []
[16:19:18] <w1pko> if feed.entry is undefined, assign empty aarray
[16:20:00] <toxz> ah ok - i only knew the short if - var entries = feed.entry ? feed.entry : [];
[16:20:11] <toxz> but this is nicer - thx
[16:20:18] <tw2113> oh ternary
[16:46:04] <defaultro> coldhead you there?
[16:48:32] <defaultro> anyways, the code you gave to me last night worked. When I removed this.submit(), it worked
[16:54:16] <tw2113> so many 404s
[16:58:19] <colonelchlorine> anyone here go to jqueryto?
[17:13:01] <LocalPCGuy> I was at jqueryto
[17:17:14] <man2000> hey all
[17:18:19] <man2000> can someone tell me why a semicolon would come at the end of a jquery selector? such as animated:  ,thanks.
[17:20:49] <shoky> do you mean a colon at the beginning of a selector, such as :animated ?
[17:21:18] <man2000> no
[17:21:29] <man2000> normally i understand that it comes at the begining
[17:21:46] <man2000> but i came across a code were the colon came after...do you knows whys that?
[17:21:54] <shoky> nope
[17:22:08] <tw2113> perhaps provide an example man2000
[17:23:08] <man2000> $(this).stop('animated:').animate(...whatever...)
[17:23:18] <shoky> whut
[17:23:50] <man2000> heres the exact thing  $(this).stop('animated:').animate({width: "78px"}, {duration: 450, easing:"easeInOutQuad"});
[17:24:34] <tw2113> no idear
[17:24:41] <shoky> i guess 'animated:' is a name of a queue ?
[17:24:43] <shoky> donno
[17:24:59] <shoky> in any case, that's not a jquery selector
[17:25:07] <shoky> .stop() doesn't take a selector
[17:25:12] <shoky> it takes a queue name
[17:25:30] <man2000> its a codel line from a slider menu
[17:25:31] <man2000> code
[17:25:39] <shoky> ?stop
[17:25:40] <bot-t> .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[17:25:46] <shoky> read that url
[17:25:53] <man2000> ok
[17:26:00] <shoky> if first argument to stop is a string, it's the queue name
[17:26:30] <shoky> whether animated: is something built-in or not.. no idea
[17:26:47] <man2000> ok man thx
[17:44:50] <batman__> How could I make my website slide like this: http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/partners/

[18:20:05] <StephenS> can I send rated with stars thing via ajax in one complete?
[18:29:46] <coldhead> StephenS: yes, that's okay with me
[18:30:21] <StephenS> Yeah but its not working
[18:30:35] <StephenS> currently using this http://www.radioactivethinking.com/rateit/example/example.htm
[18:30:44] <StephenS> and their ewxample for ajax but its not working with my code
[18:31:02] <StephenS> I serialize all things from form and send it via ajax and value is not sending
[18:32:20] <coldhead> you mean you can't see the value on the server?
[18:32:26] <StephenS> yes
[18:32:28] <StephenS> in the db
[18:33:02] <coldhead> okay
[18:33:09] <coldhead> look at the demo you linked to
[18:33:18] <coldhead> with chrome's web inspector open to the network tab
[18:33:30] <coldhead> and when you click a star to send a rating
[18:33:36] <coldhead> you'll see the ajax request
[18:33:46] <tripflex> i'm using preventdefault() and window.location.href to download a file without redirect the page
[18:33:48] <coldhead> compare what they're sending with what you're sending when you do it
[18:33:49] <tripflex> i want to use a spinner in there
[18:33:54] <coldhead> and see what's different
[18:34:06] <tripflex> how can i set it to only fire the .removeclass after window.location.href
[18:34:15] <tripflex> async is killin me hah
[18:34:59] <tripflex> duh im stupid
[18:37:21] <StephenS> coldhead, ok
[18:37:42] <StephenS> however I dontr know why is not sending when I serilaized the whole form
[18:38:39] <coldhead> i don't know either
[18:38:43] <coldhead> but i know their example works
[18:38:44] <StephenS> and its sending instantly
[18:38:50] <coldhead> so i would try to make mine work like their's
[18:39:00] <coldhead> because that's easier than debugging :P
[18:39:06] <StephenS> I dont want that, I want to fill someother info and when user click on star, not to be instanly send on server, but on submission form..
[18:40:11] <StephenS> so how could I do it?
[18:40:52] <coldhead> <input type="hidden" name="rating" value="" id="stars">
[18:41:19] <coldhead> then when the user hits a star: $('#stars').val( rating_value );
[18:41:37] <coldhead> then it will go to the server as a regular form element
[18:42:48] <StephenS> The problem is
[18:43:36] <StephenS> its rateit" id="rateit'.$msg_id.'
[18:43:49] <StephenS> class is rateit
[18:43:56] <coldhead> sigh
[18:44:06] <coldhead> you have multiple ratings
[18:44:08] <StephenS> and it has his own unique id with $msg_id
[18:44:17] <coldhead> you know why i didn't know that? BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T SAY
[18:44:21] <StephenS> Yes, on one web page, and I serialize with $('form") {..
[18:44:25] <coldhead> can we see the actual html you're working with
[18:44:28] <coldhead> and the JS you have?
[18:44:40] <coldhead> i'm going to fix myself a large martini
[18:44:46] <StephenS> not really, no as its a private project
[18:44:48] <RandalSchwartz> better yet, put it into a jsfiddle :)
[18:45:21] <RandalSchwartz> or a subset of it until you can reproduce the same problem
[18:45:37] <coldhead> ah RandalSchwartz, i was just thinking of you in relation to this tweet https://twitter.com/marick/status/310179879842885633
[18:45:37] <b-ot> coldhead: @marick: Interview flog: Looking for young programmers who know old programmers who defy stereotypical opinions of oldsters: http://t.co/H0BzuuvIR6
[18:45:46] <coldhead> no offense <3
[18:46:01] <RandalSchwartz> none taken
[18:46:08] <RandalSchwartz> I know I'm ancient
[18:46:11] <RandalSchwartz> nearly legendary at this point
[18:46:25] <RandalSchwartz> in fact, they already make up things I did earlier in my career.
[18:46:29] <RandalSchwartz> I just nod. :)
[18:47:28] <StephenS> here is code RandalSchwartz coldhead http://jsfiddle.net/dHaaD/
[18:47:50] <StephenS> just enable jquery I forgot that
[18:48:02] <tw2113> set it and forget it
[18:48:21] <coldhead> StephenS: at this point your code is doing NOTHING with the star rating plugin
[18:48:22] <StephenS> Class and jquery for rate is using http://www.radioactivethinking.com/rateit/example/example.htm
[18:48:22] <tw2113> oh wait, wrong infomercial
[18:48:28] <amirite> tw2113: shutup
[18:48:35] <coldhead> so it is no wonder that it's not working
[18:48:48] <amirite> coldhead: shutup
[18:48:57] <StephenS> coldhead, if you can c/p rateit code from http://www.radioactivethinking.com/rateit/example/example.htm to jsfiddle be my guest :)
[18:48:57] <defaultro> coldhead, did you see my message earlier?
[18:49:40] <amirite> i live in egypt, how to obtain food?
[18:49:52] <amirite> there is no such thing as food here
[18:49:59] <amirite> only mini-marts with canned tuna
[18:50:06] <amirite> and falafel stands
[18:50:24] <tw2113> that would actually be kind of awesome...various webdev libraries/tools/etc advertised like infomercials
[18:50:51] <amirite> tw2113: you talk too much
[18:50:57] <amirite> i wish you would shut your fugging trap
[18:51:01] <amirite> digg head
[18:51:26] <tw2113> that's cute
[18:51:59] * RandalSchwartz notes that his armor glows blue for a moment, but then fades
[18:53:03] <coldhead> you hear the sound of water falling on coins
[18:53:07] <coldhead> StephenS: http://jsfiddle.net/dHaaD/1/
[18:53:25] <coldhead> added an hidden input to the forms, and a .bind('rated') handler per your plugin docs
[18:53:27] <defaultro> coldhead, did you see it? I have good news for you
[18:53:35] <coldhead> EFFECTIVELY DOING ALL YOUR WORK FOR YOU
[18:53:41] <coldhead> defaultro: i don't believe i saw it!
[18:53:57] <defaultro> the code you helped me on work. I removed this.submit() :)
[18:54:23] <defaultro> $('form').submit(function(e) { ...... } it's already submitting :)
[18:54:27] <coldhead> oh THAT thing
[18:54:34] <coldhead> excellent!
[18:54:35] <defaultro> so happy this morning
[18:54:39] <RandalSchwartz> coldhead - send the invoice :)
[18:54:45] <defaultro> :D hahaha
[18:54:59] <coldhead> i could never take money for helping someone jump through php framework hoops
[18:55:05] <coldhead> it's like nazi gold
[18:55:08] <RandalSchwartz> php is the wtf
[18:55:08] <defaultro> :D
[18:55:19] <coldhead> the main thing is we can move on with our lives AND NEVER SPEAK OF THIS AGAIN
[18:55:22] <RandalSchwartz> and I know rasmus personally
[18:55:24] <RandalSchwartz> and still say it
[18:55:36] <RandalSchwartz> I know all the big language guys personally
[18:55:46] <coldhead> rasmus probably says it himself
[18:55:46] <abjorn> I'm sure you do.
[18:55:47] <RandalSchwartz> it's fun to have been a keynote speaker at so many conferences
[18:56:03] <abjorn> bah
[18:56:05] <abjorn> i hate php
[18:56:06] <defaultro> btw, the other team joined us recently and now they need to support Kohaha php. ALl I hear now is wtf is kohana. :D They know php but when they saw, they said the it's hard to read
[18:56:09] <coldhead> rasmus personally emailed my clients to ask them to disable php warnings on our production site
[18:56:15] <coldhead> i've never been more ashamed
[18:56:18] <abjorn> lol
[18:56:26] <RandalSchwartz> eww!
[18:56:27] <defaultro> took me 3 months to learn Kohana
[18:56:40] <abjorn> Well, could've been worse
[18:56:44] <RandalSchwartz> well - the first php was written in Perl
[18:56:55] <defaultro> Php fast something
[18:56:55] <abjorn> you could've had register_globals on
[18:56:57] <defaultro> PHP-fe
[18:56:58] <RandalSchwartz> and php has been playing catchup to perl (with distraction) ever since
[18:57:10] <abjorn> can't be that hard when perl hasn't been going anywhere
[18:57:21] <defaultro> looks like perl is dying
[18:57:25] <RandalSchwartz> perl's been makinghuge advancement
[18:57:29] <defaultro> oh
[18:57:31] <RandalSchwartz> you apparently are out of touch
[18:57:35] <defaultro> yup
[18:57:36] <RandalSchwartz> new major releases every year
[18:57:43] <RandalSchwartz> new minor releases every three months
[18:57:45] <abjorn> that change...what, exactly?
[18:57:47] <RandalSchwartz> perl6 is actually useful now
[18:57:49] <defaultro> that's good
[18:57:53] <abjorn> my work is a perl shop
[18:57:57] <RandalSchwartz> and perl5 is better than ever
[18:58:10] <defaultro> i need to learn ruby on rails for metasploit and refresh python
[18:58:17] <RandalSchwartz> I just finished writing a single regex that parses JSON and spits out a structure
[18:58:22] <RandalSchwartz> couldn't do that three years ago
[18:58:23] <defaultro> coolio
[18:58:34] <coldhead> defaultro: you HAVE googled for Randal Schwartz by now haven't you?
[18:58:51] <RandalSchwartz> he could just go to my wikipedia page :)
[18:59:00] <defaultro> name is very familiar or famous
[18:59:15] <coldhead> yeah i think he did a perl module once or something
[18:59:18] <RandalSchwartz> my name has been in print 50 million times (literally) with regard to perl
[18:59:27] <defaultro> MAN!!!
[18:59:39] <RandalSchwartz> camel - llama - alpaca
[18:59:42] <defaultro> So i guess you're close to Larry?
[18:59:42] <coldhead> defaultro: so be careful saying perl is dying :)
[18:59:43] <RandalSchwartz> and 255 magazine articles
[18:59:59] <coldhead> also i just got the latest camel and llama so perl isn't dying in my heart
[19:00:03] <RandalSchwartz> wait - 256 counting the most recent one
[19:00:20] <coldhead> damnit, randal, you overflowed the unsigned byte counter
[19:00:20] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - we just released a new llama and alpaca
[19:00:35] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - sorry
[19:00:38] <RandalSchwartz> but I sell out that way :)
[19:00:51] <RandalSchwartz> german linux mag wanted an article of intro to perl
[19:00:53] <defaultro> did you ever work with Larry Wall?
[19:01:01] <RandalSchwartz> define "work with"
[19:01:05] <defaultro> or had a cool chat
[19:01:05] <RandalSchwartz> I never worked against him. :)
[19:01:11] <defaultro> :)
[19:01:12] <coldhead> hahaha
[19:01:34] <defaultro> do you have linkedin?
[19:01:39] <RandalSchwartz> it was in his kitchen that I described that I needed a name for <>, and his daughter said "the diamond operator"
[19:01:43] <RandalSchwartz> and that's how that name came
[19:01:45] <coldhead> i lean heavily on the llama to teach programming to non programmers, even though i'm teaching js and not perl
[19:02:07] <defaultro> i have a perl book here and a Regular Expression
[19:02:13] <RandalSchwartz> ... www.linkedin.com/in/randalschwartz/
[19:02:19] <defaultro> cool
[19:02:26] <RandalSchwartz> yeah, I'm mentioned in both of Jeffrey's books
[19:02:39] <abjorn> yeah, well I've
[19:02:39] <defaultro> :D
[19:02:41] <abjorn> read books
[19:02:43] <RandalSchwartz> I'm mentioned in about 50 books. :)
[19:02:49] <RandalSchwartz> 20 of which are about computer crime
[19:02:55] <RandalSchwartz> but that's a whole nuther story
[19:02:59] <defaultro> is it ok to add you?
[19:03:12] <RandalSchwartz> NO DO NOT ADD ME TO ANY OF YOUR SOCIAL NETS
[19:03:15] <RandalSchwartz> just kidding, go ahead
[19:03:19] <defaultro> :)
[19:04:01] <coldhead> i like that nuther story!
[19:04:24] <RandalSchwartz> when I interviewed John Resig for my FLOSS Weekly podcast (50k downloads per week), he revealed that he was a big Perl fan.
[19:04:26] <coldhead> abjorn: good for you, buddy. stay  in school
[19:04:34] <RandalSchwartz> which is probably why I like jQuery so much
[19:04:58] <coldhead> RandalSchwartz: when *i* complimented resig on that podcast he said how great it was to meet you and what an inspiration perl had been
[19:04:58] <RandalSchwartz> ... http://twit.tv/floss55
[19:05:13] * RandalSchwartz blushes
[19:05:16] <coldhead> GROUP HUG
[19:05:22] <coldhead> made me like the guy better tbh
[19:05:29] <coldhead> perl haters are very tedious
[19:05:51] <RandalSchwartz> perl haters are persistent though
[19:05:59] <RandalSchwartz> they end up inventing python
[19:06:05] <RandalSchwartz> where 8 spaces is not the same as a tab
[19:06:34] <RandalSchwartz> luckily - ruby has been a good inspiration for features for perl6
[19:06:41] <RandalSchwartz> so I do not fault matz
[19:06:50] <RandalSchwartz> but guido... doesn't grok objects.
[19:06:53] <RandalSchwartz> there's a long story there
[19:06:59] <RandalSchwartz> but I can't put it all in this margin
[19:07:10] <RandalSchwartz> or closures
[19:07:14] <RandalSchwartz> but that's another story. :)
[19:07:53] <defaultro> Thanks Randal! :)
[19:08:01] <Gazpacho> i like xkcd
[19:08:03] * RandalSchwartz bows
[19:08:06] * RandalSchwartz hits head on desk
[19:08:08] <RandalSchwartz> ouch!
[19:08:13] <defaultro> lol
[19:08:32] <RandalSchwartz> I've done some nice stuff with jQuery already
[19:08:36] <Gazpacho> PHP is like Perl if Perl had been written by a middle school student whose mother says he is "good with computers"
[19:08:39] <RandalSchwartz> more than I thought I'd be able to do as front end
[19:08:43] <RandalSchwartz> since that's not my area
[19:09:06] <RandalSchwartz> I'm looking forward to my interview with the co-author of Dart
[19:09:12] <RandalSchwartz> Dart might be the bomb
[19:09:23] <systemfault> Or will fail...
[19:09:35] <RandalSchwartz> well bomb has many meanings :)
[19:09:42] <RandalSchwartz> given that chrome supports it natively...
[19:09:48] <RandalSchwartz> I'd say there's some traction
[19:09:57] <systemfault> That's the issue… only chrome will ever support it
[19:09:59] <coldhead> but other browsers have 0 interest
[19:10:05] <systemfault> asm.js has more chances.
[19:10:09] <RandalSchwartz> well - for them, you downconvert to js
[19:10:20] <coldhead> i expect we'll just be stuck with js forever
[19:10:23] <RandalSchwartz> since dart is always semantically convertable to js
[19:10:45] <RandalSchwartz> that's part of what I like about it
[19:10:59] <RandalSchwartz> smart browsers can read it directly
[19:11:03] <defaultro> btw guys, how can we prevent an xmlhttprequest to pull our page?
[19:11:07] <RandalSchwartz> dumb browsers can read it as js
[19:11:12] <RandalSchwartz> prevent?
[19:11:19] <RandalSchwartz> put it in a different domain. :)
[19:11:24] <defaultro> k
[19:11:45] <RandalSchwartz> or just make it return 404 all the time
[19:11:53] <defaultro> :)
[19:12:16] <systemfault> 418 is better
[19:12:22] <systemfault> 404 is uncool
[19:12:27] <coldhead> unplugging the server is better
[19:12:30] <RandalSchwartz> 418 is the pigeon one?
[19:12:42] <Gazpacho> <coldhead> unplugging the server is better
[19:12:49] <coldhead> ?418
[19:12:49] <bot-t> I am a teapot
[19:12:50] <RandalSchwartz> oh - teapot
[19:12:52] <RandalSchwartz> that's what I meant
[19:12:57] <systemfault> :P
[19:13:10] <systemfault> HTCPCP :P
[19:13:16] <defaultro> :D
[19:13:30] <RandalSchwartz> 509 - bandwidth exceeded
[19:14:21] <RandalSchwartz> 426 - upgrade required
[19:15:00] <RandalSchwartz> 431 - request header fields too large
[19:15:01] <Gazpacho> 187
[19:15:02] <RandalSchwartz> "you're too big"
[19:15:16] <systemfault> My <beep> is soooo big that my wife returns me a 413
[19:15:28] <RandalSchwartz> but not a 431?
[19:15:46] <systemfault> 413 is Request Entity Too Large
[19:15:46] <RandalSchwartz> oh - they're similar
[19:15:48] <coldhead> ?413
[19:15:49] <bot-t> Request Entity Too Large
[19:15:55] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[19:15:55] * bot-t sighs
[19:15:59] <RandalSchwartz> 411 - length required :)
[19:16:08] <coldhead> that sounds like a difficult marriage, i am sorry systemfault
[19:16:12] <RandalSchwartz> that sounds more likely
[19:16:18] <systemfault> Marriage is always difficult :(
[19:16:29] * RandalSchwartz has avoided that problem for 51 years so far
[19:16:37] <systemfault> I avoided it for 29 years...
[19:16:43] <systemfault> Then failed.
[19:16:44] <coldhead> eh give it time
[19:16:55] <gf3> Hahaha
[19:16:59] <gf3> coldhead ❤
[19:17:00] <coldhead> one of these days we'll all marry the singularity
[19:17:06] <RandalSchwartz> at this point, whatever people would want to marry me for is my money, and I don't have much of that.
[19:17:32] <coldhead> you still have your karaoke skills
[19:17:39] <coldhead> some women are into that
[19:17:41] <coldhead> probably
[19:17:46] <RandalSchwartz> however, I'm very happy I've lost 45 pounds and 6 inches around my waist in the past 6 months
[19:18:26] <systemfault> Nice
[19:18:33] <systemfault> I have about as much to lose..
[19:18:35] <RandalSchwartz> I'm lighter than I was at the end of highschool
[19:18:49] <RandalSchwartz> no calorie counting, no starving, no exercise.
[19:19:49] <batman> Can someone please help me with a javascrit /etc problem?
[19:19:57] <RandalSchwartz> what is /etc ?
[19:20:01] <coldhead> this isn't really a good time batman
[19:20:04] <RandalSchwartz> heh
[19:20:07] <batman> lol
[19:20:12] <batman> its just a joke. calm ppls
[19:20:15] * RandalSchwartz looks for robi
[19:20:17] <RandalSchwartz> robin
[19:20:22] <RandalSchwartz> damnit joke ruined
[19:20:26] <batman> haha
[19:20:40] <RandalSchwartz> batman - how old were you when you chose that handle? :)
[19:20:45] <coldhead> robinsmidsrod?
[19:20:45] <RandalSchwartz> I'm guessing 13
[19:20:56] <batman> im 14
[19:20:59] <coldhead> smidsrod is quite a surname
[19:21:04] <RandalSchwartz> ah!  there we go
[19:21:11] <coldhead> uncanny
[19:21:16] <RandalSchwartz> I can generally call that
[19:21:19] <systemfault> Perhaps he's indian and he's really batman
[19:21:27] <batman> Im batman!
[19:21:32] <RandalSchwartz> the dorkier the handle, the more likely it was chosen earlier
[19:21:39] <RandalSchwartz> instant message batman?
[19:21:44] <RandalSchwartz> or do you not have a "'" key?
[19:21:51] <systemfault> http://www.funfive.net/images/Batman%20Bin%20Suparman.jpg Like that
[19:21:53] <coldhead> hahahah
[19:21:54] <RandalSchwartz> perhaps your keyboard can be fixed.
[19:22:12] <batman>  Do you even benchpress?
[19:22:21] <RandalSchwartz> no - I'm a lazy ass.
[19:22:24] <RandalSchwartz> I barely walk.
[19:22:39] <RandalSchwartz> I spend most of my time in Los Angeles, so I drive three blocks. :)
[19:22:48] <RandalSchwartz> it's required there.
[19:22:58] <coldhead> pedestrians get shot don't though?
[19:23:05] <coldhead> that's what grand theft auto taught me
[19:23:07] <RandalSchwartz> not in the places I hang out
[19:23:13] <RandalSchwartz> GTA taught me to find hookers. :)
[19:23:19] <coldhead> good grief man
[19:23:23] <coldhead> this was a family channel
[19:23:27] <RandalSchwartz> sorry
[19:23:28] <coldhead> :)
[19:23:33] * RandalSchwartz rewinds his last 30 seconds
[19:23:50] <RandalSchwartz> anyway, batman, what's your issue?
[19:23:59] <RandalSchwartz> can you reduce it to something on jsfiddle?
[19:24:08] * RandalSchwartz goes back into helpdesk mode
[19:25:08] <RandalSchwartz> did we scare him away?
[19:25:08] <batman> um
[19:25:15] <batman> Have you used Reveal presentation?
[19:25:20] <RandalSchwartz> no
[19:25:21] <coldhead> the young have short attention spans
[19:25:24] <RandalSchwartz> and I hope to never to
[19:25:27] <coldhead> you giving a presentation batman?
[19:25:29] <RandalSchwartz> with that kind of name
[19:25:30] <coldhead> that's exciting!
[19:25:59] <RandalSchwartz> it's enterprise scalable!
[19:26:03] <batman> this one http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/
[19:26:08] <RandalSchwartz> and webscale
[19:26:11] <RandalSchwartz> like node.js
[19:26:24] <coldhead> i've used that batman
[19:26:25] <systemfault> Your mom is webscale
[19:26:31] <RandalSchwartz> which is event driven, so it's better than sql solutions
[19:26:32] <coldhead> in fact i should be using it right now
[19:26:47] <batman> coldhead: i need help putting 2 things on it. its not working. its 2 jquery plugins; i can upload them if u want
[19:27:01] <coldhead> i don't want that
[19:27:05] <coldhead> how are they "not working"
[19:27:22] <RandalSchwartz> those cartoons with node.js and mongodb get played so often at $client
[19:27:29] <batman> coldhead: do u want a live version?
[19:27:30] <RandalSchwartz> the text is burned into my brain
[19:27:36] <coldhead> sure batman
[19:27:39] <RandalSchwartz> "u"
[19:27:42] <batman> coldhead: its hard to explain;
[19:27:42] <RandalSchwartz> is this SMS?
[19:27:45] * RandalSchwartz looks, no
[19:27:53] <RandalSchwartz> it's spelled "you".  learn that.
[19:27:58] <systemfault> no y u say that?
[19:27:58] <b-ot> systemfault: (屮'Д')屮
[19:27:58] <coldhead> RandalSchwartz: he might be on his smartphone
[19:28:20] <RandalSchwartz> if he's paying for IRC by the byte, he's dumb. :)
[19:28:21] <batman> coldhead: ok im uploading now
[19:28:23] <batman> coldhead: hang on
[19:28:30] <RandalSchwartz> as in, "it sucks 2 b u"
[19:28:36] <coldhead> lol
[19:29:05] <coldhead> batman: really looking forward to working with you on this project!
[19:29:11] <systemfault> RandalSchwartz: sux, not sucks
[19:29:18] <batman> coldhead: thx!
[19:29:50] <RandalSchwartz> yeah sorry
[19:29:53] <RandalSchwartz> forgot the abbrev
[19:32:54] <solarflares> so javascript ninja came in the mail today
[19:33:05] <tw2113> yay
[19:33:12] <tw2113> read anything yet?
[19:33:17] <solarflares> nah just got home
[19:33:18] <tw2113> first 2 chapters are kind of fluff
[19:33:25] <solarflares> flipped through a couple pages, looking forward to it
[19:33:40] <systemfault> Im 2 1337 4 that b00k
[19:34:00] <systemfault> They call me the DOMinator
[19:34:24] <systemfault>  I should go to sleep...
[19:34:29] <RandalSchwartz> John Resig should change his name to Jay Query. :)
[19:34:48] <tw2113> RandalSchwartz, nice thing about the book is that it's not focused on jquery
[19:34:56] <solarflares> i still consider myself a JS nub, so I've been going over a lot of content since I got this job a little over a month ago
[19:35:01] <solarflares> my skill level has increased dramatically
[19:35:02] <RandalSchwartz> nub?
[19:35:09] <tw2113> it gets mentioned and used a few times so far, but it's mostly plain js
[19:35:11] <solarflares> noob
[19:35:13] <solarflares> *
[19:35:17] <RandalSchwartz> noobie
[19:35:18] <coldhead> newb, archaic name for people from Nubia
[19:35:29] <solarflares> nubians
[19:35:29] <RandalSchwartz> noob is pronounced "newbie"
[19:35:37] <coldhead> Gnu B?
[19:35:49] <RandalSchwartz> but people forgot that, and started to use "noob" without the ending syllable
[19:35:59] <systemfault> coldhead: GNU/b?
[19:36:10] <coldhead> thx systemfault, installing now
[19:36:54] <solarflares> lol
[19:37:10] <solarflares> i hope stallmans headstone says, "ITS GNU/LINUX"
[19:37:21] <coldhead> i hope he'd add the apostrophe
[19:37:27] <coldhead> that would be really annoying otherwise
[19:37:29] <tw2113> Nubia...neighbor to Druidia
[19:37:38] <LocalPCGuy> I into the chapters on functions in the JavaScript Ninja book...pretty decent so far
[19:37:39] <coldhead> last thing you want is a zombie stallman adding an apostrophe to his own headstone
[19:37:46] <RandalSchwartz> and not "IT'S"?
[19:37:50] <RandalSchwartz> that'd be ironic :)
[19:37:58] <solarflares> he'd dp
[19:38:02] <tw2113> it's not js, it's gnu/js
[19:38:03] <solarflares> IT)S
[19:38:09] <solarflares> do*
[19:38:10] <systemfault> A GNU/Zombie cause by a GPL'd version of the T-Virus
[19:38:14] <systemfault> *caused
[19:38:23] <coldhead> i am going to OH myself on twitter
[19:38:27] <coldhead> the ultimate shame
[19:38:32] <tw2113> i do all the time coldhead
[19:38:36] <tw2113> i call it "OH in my head"
[19:38:38] <RandalSchwartz> I met RMS's one-time girlfriend
[19:38:48] <coldhead> that's why i unfollowed you, tw2113
[19:38:48] <RandalSchwartz> and she hooked up with other people on the cruise they were on :)
[19:38:55] <tw2113> i'm up to chapter 7 in the ninja book. Closures and Prototype will be re-read chapters for sure
[19:38:55] <solarflares> thats rude
[19:39:05] <coldhead> RandalSchwartz: was that the Alyx the kernel was going to be named after?
[19:39:05] <solarflares> lol
[19:39:09] <coldhead> Alix?
[19:39:09] <coldhead> idk
[19:39:13] <tw2113> i'm fine with that coldy
[19:39:31] <RandalSchwartz> yeah she figured out other geeks were even cooler than RMS, and didn't smell as bad. :)
[19:40:21] <batman> coldhead: im trying to compress it asweel so you can download it
[19:40:29] <systemfault> But only RMS is self-sufficient…. he grows he food from his feet
[19:40:33] <systemfault> *his
[19:40:42] <solarflares> yes
[19:40:47] <solarflares> only while drinking pepsi though
[19:41:13] <coldhead> goddamn it batman, don't make me download
[19:41:15] <coldhead> just give me a URL
[19:41:21] <coldhead> i have things to do, bongs to hit
[19:41:26] <batman> coldhead: ok
[19:41:44] <coldhead> slowest help session ever
[19:41:49] <batman> coldhead: http://economics.comze.com/
[19:41:52] <batman> coldhead: sorry
[19:41:52] <coldhead> WE MIGHT AS WELL BE DOING THIS BY EMAIL
[19:41:59] <batman> coldhead: sorry...
[19:42:04] <solarflares> coldhead: i favor the edibles
[19:42:06] <TripTastic> anyone know how to release registration on a nick?
[19:42:09] <batman> coldhead: WAIT DONT CLICK IT
[19:42:10] <solarflares> bhang bars
[19:42:12] <RandalSchwartz> let's use web page postings!
[19:42:13] <TripTastic> i forget how to do it
[19:42:14] <solarflares> NO DONT CLIOCK
[19:42:24] <systemfault> TripTastic: Ask a staffer on #Freenode
[19:42:34] <coldhead> too late batman
[19:42:35] <RandalSchwartz> it's like "gotomeeting", but the opposite
[19:42:39] <RandalSchwartz> "comefromemeeting"
[19:42:41] <batman> coldhead: refresh page
[19:43:06] <coldhead> now i am navigating directories
[19:43:08] <coldhead> :(
[19:43:14] <RandalSchwartz> "don't click on anything"
[19:43:24] <batman> coldhead: go to /prezi
[19:43:27] <coldhead> okay, prezi
[19:43:31] <batman> its not a prezi
[19:43:33] <coldhead> this looks like reveal
[19:43:35] <coldhead> yes
[19:43:37] <batman> i just named the folder anything that came ito my mind
[19:43:38] <coldhead> it's a web of lies
[19:43:38] <RandalSchwartz> viceprezi
[19:43:39] <coldhead> continue
[19:43:40] <batman> its the reveal .js
[19:43:43] <solarflares> thats like me when I realize there is a serious bug in my code I didnt think about that I realize right when I go to show my boss
[19:43:46] <solarflares> DONT TOUCH IT
[19:43:47] <solarflares> ITS FRAGILE
[19:43:55] <batman> coldhead: http://economics.comze.com/prezi/#/3
[19:44:01] <RandalSchwartz> "don't click on anything that looks like a link"
[19:44:04] <coldhead> batman: your scripts are all being included at the top of your html
[19:44:08] <batman> coldhead: im trying to put that script onto here
[19:44:12] <coldhead> i'd be loading them at the bottom where reveal.js is loaded
[19:44:18] <coldhead> in fact, after reveal.js
[19:44:22] <batman> coldhead: oh
[19:44:47] <batman> coldhead: the scripts had them in the head section; i copied and pasted them too in my head
[19:44:57] <solarflares> i saw this cool site that shows the state of your code after each step
[19:44:59] <coldhead> yes well, you didn't need to
[19:45:13] <batman> coldhead: sorr
[19:45:16] <batman> coldhead: y
[19:45:24] <RandalSchwartz> wait - not using <script src=...>
[19:45:27] <coldhead> batman: why on earth are you using MM_preloadimages
[19:45:28] <RandalSchwartz> that's pretty bad
[19:45:30] <coldhead> in this day and age
[19:45:33] <solarflares> guys check this out https://github.com/toolness/slowmo-js
[19:45:47] <coldhead> or rather, failing to use it
[19:45:49] <batman> coldhead: i copied and pasted them from my  other jquery plugin demo page
[19:45:51] <solarflares> actually this is the demo sorry http://toolness.github.com/slowmo-js/
[19:45:59] <coldhead> batman: it's good to have some idea what you're doing
[19:46:03] <coldhead> :\
[19:46:05] <batman> coldhead: im trying to learn
[19:46:12] <coldhead> yes it's okay
[19:46:12] <RandalSchwartz> "im"
[19:46:17] <RandalSchwartz> instant message?
[19:46:18] <batman> coldhead: I'm
[19:46:22] <RandalSchwartz> or are you really trying to type
[19:46:25] <RandalSchwartz> "I'm"
[19:46:34] <coldhead> batman: so do us two favours, move your <script>s to the bottom
[19:46:41] <RandalSchwartz> there are keys on your keyboard.  use them.
[19:46:46] <batman> coldhead: all of them?
[19:46:50] <coldhead> and move the <script>stuff here;</script> into a new JS file
[19:46:57] <batman> coldhead: ok
[19:47:02] <coldhead> and then do <script src="new_js_file.js">
[19:47:11] <defaultro> in, js, I can do this -->  var somevar = <?php echo "somevalue"; ?>   What if vise versa but still inside the same <script> in a .php file?
[19:47:15] <coldhead> so we can see your JS in pure glorious form
[19:47:15] <batman> coldhead: even the css to a new .css file?
[19:47:22] <coldhead> i don't care about the css
[19:47:25] <coldhead> that's not my problem
[19:47:26] <batman> ok
[19:47:29] <coldhead> i mean you should obviously
[19:47:32] <solarflares> yes you should
[19:47:35] <coldhead> but take that to ##css
[19:47:35] <solarflares> but only one file
[19:47:38] <coldhead> and let them rouse on you
[19:47:40] <RandalSchwartz> I had a mapping of country to state .js that really worked out to be a single .js file that I could reuse
[19:47:58] <RandalSchwartz> instead of downloading the mapping of country to states for every single popup that needed it. :)
[19:48:52] <RandalSchwartz> so with jquery, if I find a form field of country_XXX and state_XXX in a form, I map them together with functions that just make them work
[19:49:07] <batman> coldhead: do i put even the 4 line scripts to a new .js file?
[19:49:13] <RandalSchwartz> took me a while to write, but it worked
[19:49:35] <RandalSchwartz> 4 lines never stays 4 lines
[19:49:52] <coldhead> put ALL your JS in .js files
[19:49:59] <batman> coldhead: ok
[19:50:04] <coldhead> until you know when you're allowed not to
[19:50:15] <RandalSchwartz> it also makes syntax highlighting work better :)
[19:50:17] <coldhead> leave the reveal.js inline JS alone because they know what they're doing
[19:50:45] <coldhead> batman: lose onload="MM_preloadImages('images/AustraliaSingapore_4.png')"
[19:50:51] <coldhead> that's horrible
[19:51:06] <RandalSchwartz> very very terrible
[19:51:09] <batman> coldhead: its just a mouse over effect
[19:51:10] <tw2113> oh macromedia
[19:51:16] <tw2113> it's ancient
[19:51:16] <batman> coldhead: and it was default on Adobe dreamweaver
[19:51:25] <RandalSchwartz> as that indian guy on big bang theory would say
[19:51:26] <tw2113> i've seen dinosaurs younger than MM_*
[19:51:28] <coldhead> we don't like to talk about adobe dreamweaver in here
[19:51:35] <batman> coldhead: i use netbeans though
[19:51:35] <coldhead> we're web professionals
[19:51:41] <coldhead> trying to improve our public image
[19:51:43] <batman> coldhead: i dont think im professional...
[19:51:47] <RandalSchwartz> netbeans is a WTF
[19:51:53] <RandalSchwartz> "im"
[19:51:54] <coldhead> THEN AS A COURTESY, BATMAN
[19:51:56] <RandalSchwartz> instant message?
[19:52:04] <coldhead> hahahah let it go randal :)
[19:52:09] <RandalSchwartz> No way
[19:52:12] <batman> i have eclipse too?
[19:52:12] <tw2113> batman always uses the most modern tools
[19:52:12] <coldhead> hahahha
[19:52:14] <RandalSchwartz> I have to have a purpose here. :)
[19:52:16] <tw2113> the real batman that is
[19:52:32] <RandalSchwartz> I sat next to Adam West for 4 hours on a flight
[19:52:43] <RandalSchwartz> I think I'm a better judge of Batman than anyone here. :)
[19:52:47] <batman> coldhead: ok i put everything in the js file
[19:52:48] <coldhead> holy see, batman!
[19:52:53] <coldhead> thanks batman
[19:53:07] <batman> coldhead: do u want me to upload the contents again?
[19:53:14] <coldhead> that would be great
[19:53:19] <coldhead> otherwise i have to imagine the changes
[19:53:25] <coldhead> and i just took a bunch of pills
[19:53:32] <batman> coldhead: ok done
[19:53:47] <batman> coldhead: they in the prezi/scripts/ folder now (the js files)
[19:53:52] <coldhead> and now that we're on page 1
[19:53:55] <coldhead> WHAT IS THE ACTUAL PROBLEM
[19:53:56] <solarflares> sublime text 2 is the only way
[19:54:09] <deepy> RandalSchwartz: but have you met batman o'brien?
[19:54:11] <batman> coldhead: can u go to "Distribution of Income" page
[19:54:17] <batman> coldhead: in the powerpoint
[19:54:22] <coldhead> yup
[19:54:31] <coldhead> oh i am so in your powerpoint batman
[19:54:36] <coldhead> i am right up in there
[19:54:37] <RandalSchwartz> "u"
[19:54:37] <batman> coldhead: do u see ""SCRIPT 1" isn't working!!! "
[19:54:38] <coldhead> page 3
[19:54:40] <tw2113> dreamweaver....powerpoint....*checks year*
[19:54:41] <coldhead> yes i do
[19:54:43] <RandalSchwartz> damn it, stupid kidw
[19:54:45] <RandalSchwartz> kids
[19:54:45] <LocalPCGuy> I like Subline Text 2, but Vim is intriuging
[19:54:46] <solarflares> has anyone seen any good impress.js that doesnt look like the demo
[19:54:52] <batman> coldhead: click on script one. thats how it should look like alone; i cant put it in my reveal js
[19:54:56] <solarflares> you can vim in sublime text 2
[19:54:58] <solarflares> and then some
[19:55:10] <solarflares> there is no reason to use another text editor
[19:55:16] <batman> coldhead: its a link on my site; it shows the origianl demo i need to put it in my page...
[19:55:18] <LocalPCGuy> yah, I have the vim plugin, auto lint (CSS/JS) al setup
[19:55:25] <RandalSchwartz> seriously batman, are you paying for IRC *by the character*?
[19:55:33] <RandalSchwartz> If so, it "sux 2 be u"
[19:55:36] <solarflares> lol linting used to piss me off so much at first
[19:55:37] <batman> ?
[19:55:46] <RandalSchwartz> batman - the word is "you", not "u"
[19:55:49] <solarflares> now i just submit to the linter
[19:56:06] <LocalPCGuy> I absolutely LOVE auto-linting
[19:56:08] <batman> randalschwartz: fine. I'll talk professionally.
[19:56:16] <RandalSchwartz> no - just talk like a human.
[19:56:23] <batman> im batman!
[19:56:26] <batman> I'm!
[19:56:30] <RandalSchwartz> "im" - instant message?
[19:56:30] <solarflares> luckily my co-worker has been teaching me good habits
[19:56:34] <batman> I'm Batman*
[19:56:49] <solarflares> asl batman
[19:56:54] <LocalPCGuy> good habits can't beat seeing a line get highlighted the instant you forget a ;
[19:56:58] <batman> solarflares: asl?
[19:57:17] <RandalSchwartz> I mean seriously, have the kids forgetten entirely how to use proper spelling and punctuation
[19:57:31] <tw2113> <---the Goddamn Batman
[19:57:36] <solarflares> omgur ; lame,
[19:57:37] <RandalSchwartz> oops, and I spelled that wrong. :)
[19:57:55] <RandalSchwartz> slightly discounting my point.
[19:58:00] <LocalPCGuy> speelin and puncuation is fer nirds
[19:58:05] <coldhead> batman: you want to use Fork It on your presentation?
[19:58:08] <RandalSchwartz> and I am a nerd
[19:58:10] <solarflares> LocalPCGuy: yeah, but he was the one who encouraged me to lint my code
[19:58:11] <LocalPCGuy> :)
[19:58:12] <RandalSchwartz> and pround of it
[19:58:17] <RandalSchwartz> proud too
[19:58:20] <LocalPCGuy> lol
[19:58:23] <batman> coldhead: just in 1 slide (the one i showed you)
[19:58:23] <coldhead> batman: you want that ribbon in the top right corner of the slides?
[19:58:29] <batman> coldhead: not all of them; just 1
[19:58:31] <RandalSchwartz> apparently I need to stop typing soon
[19:58:39] <batman> coldhead: "Distribution of Income"
[19:58:45] <LocalPCGuy> I am firmly in the pro ; camp solarflares
[19:58:48] <coldhead> batman: why does it need to be a plugin
[19:58:49] <RandalSchwartz> "I tried strong typing once... nearly ruined my keyboard"
[19:58:54] <LocalPCGuy> .shrug
[19:58:56] <coldhead> why can't you just include that element on the page
[19:58:59] <coldhead> and style it with CSS
[19:59:11] <coldhead> hahahaha
[19:59:13] <batman> coldhead: i did! i copied the 2 html css tags in the head
[19:59:18] <batman> coldhead: and the body in my slide
[19:59:50] <coldhead> batman: so it's only appearing on that slide
[19:59:54] <coldhead> as desired
[20:00:00] <coldhead> it's just in the wrong place?
[20:00:02] <batman> coldhead: yes but it doesn't work
[20:00:09] <batman> coldhead: and its in the wrong place
[20:00:15] <coldhead> it "doesn't work"
[20:00:26] <batman> coldhead: this is how its meant to look like http://localhost/prezi/pull/index.html
[20:00:31] <batman> coldhead: WAIT NOW
[20:00:57] <solarflares> did you guys see the dude who made an interactive hologram with a prism, three.js, and leap motion
[20:00:59] <batman> coldhead: whoops thats my localhost one. http://economics.comze.com/prezi/pull/index.html
[20:01:05] <solarflares> lol
[20:01:26] <LocalPCGuy> solarflares no - you have source code for it?
[20:01:27] <coldhead> batman: i still don't see why this needs to be a plugin
[20:01:33] <coldhead> instead of just a fancy styled link
[20:01:42] <LocalPCGuy> solarflares I have a Leap, but haven't got anything cool to show off yet
[20:01:52] <batman> coldhead: i donno!!! i copied the code from the github and pasted it in my own one
[20:02:00] <LocalPCGuy> solarflares or just a link to the demo
[20:02:13] <coldhead> sweet zombie jesus
[20:02:20] <batman> now i feel dumb :(
[20:02:22] <solarflares> lemme find it
[20:02:37] <solarflares> http://badassjs.com/post/44786596458/an-iron-man-like-3d-hologram-controlled-by-leap-motion
[20:02:54] <solarflares> pretty creative and simple enough I think to where any of us could do it
[20:02:58] <batman> coldhead: would you like a zip version of my site . it finished compressing....?
[20:03:36] <LocalPCGuy> solarflares that is badass
[20:03:49] <solarflares> is that jsut a computer screen or is it an actual projector
[20:03:50] <solarflares> just*
[20:03:57] <solarflares> i need one of those
[20:04:01] <solarflares> that gesture thing the leap motion
[20:04:05] <LocalPCGuy> looks like a monitor is a prism on top
[20:04:06] <solarflares> is only 80 bucks i think
[20:04:17] <LocalPCGuy> yah, I have a Leap motion
[20:04:22] <LocalPCGuy> dev kit model
[20:04:27] <coldhead> batman: i would add a <div> around the forkit ribbon in your html like so http://jsfiddle.net/nJD29/
[20:04:27] <solarflares> i should get it
[20:04:32] <solarflares> i need to pre-order the oculus too
[20:04:33] <foo> http://jsfiddle.net/frB4N/ - I am trying to change the value of the text input type with the name part_number - what is wrong with my jquery? Hmm
[20:04:37] <coldhead> and i would make that position absolute and top 0 and right 0
[20:04:43] <solarflares> when I get a raise ill buy the oculus
[20:04:45] <coldhead> that puts it in the right place at least
[20:05:39] <LocalPCGuy> foo ack tables
[20:05:48] <batman> coldhead: ok im doing it now
[20:05:49] <foo> LocalPCGuy: I am hacking at some other code. This is a mess, I know.
[20:05:55] <coldhead> batman: let me tell you honestly what i think, now that i have seen what forkit.js is supposed to do.
[20:06:00] <LocalPCGuy> foo you are trying to make the first input show "test"
[20:06:00] <LocalPCGuy> ?
[20:06:09] <foo> LocalPCGuy: yes, as the value for the text input type
[20:06:12] <coldhead> integrating forkit.js into reveal.js will take many hours IF it is even possible
[20:06:22] <batman> coldhead....aw
[20:06:24] <coldhead> i would settle for a simple link to wherever you want to show
[20:06:29] <coldhead> with target="_blank"
[20:06:33] <coldhead> to open in a new window
[20:06:55] <coldhead> reveal.js does a lot of magic with the browser to turn it into a slideshow and it's not going to get along with forkit's fancyness
[20:07:00] <coldhead> i am so sorry for your loss
[20:07:04] <batman> coldhead: aww ok
[20:07:19] <coldhead> batman: it is more or less my first day using jquery so feel free to keep asking other people for help now that you have a more sane working demo
[20:07:40] <LocalPCGuy> foo helps if you include jquery library
[20:07:42] <foo> LocalPCGuy: I must be close, hmm
[20:07:42] <coldhead> i must now perform certain acts and deeds of which it is not licit to speak
[20:07:48] <batman> coldhead: can you atleast help me put this one instaed in any slide? http://economics.comze.com/connect/v.html
[20:07:54] <LocalPCGuy> foo http://jsfiddle.net/localpcguy/frB4N/1/
[20:07:55] <foo> LocalPCGuy: oh, I did do that on my instance, forgot to save and share that link. haha
[20:07:59] <batman> coldhead: or will that take hours too?
[20:08:06] <LocalPCGuy> foo and you need square brackets
[20:08:22] <LocalPCGuy> foo and then it works
[20:08:24] <foo> LocalPCGuy: ohh, forgot that. thanks :)
[20:09:00] <coldhead> batman: reveal.js is to attracticely present certain basic html, not for incorporating the entire internet into it
[20:09:08] <coldhead> i would try an <iframe> with that page in it
[20:09:18] <coldhead> that would be simplest and might look like what you want
[20:09:33] <batman> coldhead: ok how do i use "iframe"
[20:09:39] <batman> coldhead: let me google this
[20:10:11] <batman> coldhead: so it just displays a website on it right?
[20:10:59] <coldhead> batman: http://jsfiddle.net/pbL7x/
[20:11:03] <coldhead> just like that
[20:11:21] <coldhead> then the contents of the iframe uses its own css and js and won't mess with reveal
[20:11:24] <batman> coldhead: OMG thx; ill just use that
[20:11:31] <coldhead> it's the easiest way
[20:11:35] <coldhead> good luck batman!
[20:11:56] <coldhead> and try to use better spelling and grammar in future as a courtesy to our net.gods
[20:12:38] <batman> coldhead: :)
[20:13:20] <solarflares> and dont take things too personally
[20:14:43] <coldhead> that's terrible advice!
[20:14:58] <coldhead> i rely on taking things personally to make me feel like a worthwhile person!
[20:15:01] <tw2113> coldhead always takes stuff personally
[20:15:18] <coldhead> i print out IRC logs and PORE OVER THEM
[20:15:24] <coldhead> FOR MONTHS
[20:15:29] <coldhead> to try and "work on my game"
[20:15:41] <foo> LocalPCGuy: hm, I applied it to the live site but it doesn't seem to be working. Care to take a look? Hmph.
[20:16:13] <LocalPCGuy> foo sure
[20:16:47] <foo> LocalPCGuy: http://www.aeri.com/products/search/?q=kjasdfklasdfjas - if you view source, you will notice this code at the bottom. Note: I know this site code is a complete mess. This is a 2 year long project and I am cleaning up someone else's mess and it's not fun, we just want it working.
[20:17:21] <coldhead> sorry for your burdens, foo
[20:17:38] <foo> coldhead: it's ok, it's all part of the developer game. :) We think this other guy outsourced it or something
[20:19:43] <tw2113> for me, coldhead is an outsource
[20:19:48] <foo> ha
[20:20:08] <coldhead> in that terrible things and bad code come out of me?
[20:20:16] <coldhead> i guess you are right
[20:20:23] <tw2113> i was thinking distance
[20:20:58] <coldhead> we're in the same global village buddy
[20:21:11] <tw2113> continental though..
[20:21:15] <coldhead> i can't believe batman left, i wanted to talk to him more
[20:21:17] <tw2113> unless you're in the US suddenly
[20:21:24] <tw2113> check for brucewayne
[20:21:28] <coldhead> hahah
[20:21:57] <foo> LocalPCGuy: what's strange is I don't see any errors in the console
[20:22:05] <LocalPCGuy> foo throw a console.log("test") in the function ready
[20:22:11] <LocalPCGuy> foo make sure it is hitting
[20:22:30] <LocalPCGuy> foo testing jQuery("[name='part_number']").val("test"); in the console works, so the problem isn't with that line of code
[20:22:42] <foo> LocalPCGuy: interesting, ok
[20:23:25] <foo> LocalPCGuy: I just added console.log("test") ; and that shows up. hmmm, so it is getting worked. So, I think, Query("[name='part_number']") must not be matching
[20:23:45] <LocalPCGuy> is the form added via JS?
[20:23:48] <foo> LocalPCGuy: maybe I need to narrow it down with type="text"
[20:23:49] <foo> LocalPCGuy: yes
[20:23:57] <LocalPCGuy> foo well, that is an important bit of info
[20:24:07] <LocalPCGuy> foo the form does not exist when your code is run
[20:24:09] <foo> LocalPCGuy: ah, I didn't think it mattered, whoops
[20:24:20] <foo> LocalPCGuy: but my code is at the very end of the doc, hmm
[20:24:28] <LocalPCGuy> foo doesn't matter
[20:24:43] <foo> LocalPCGuy: I see, do I have to delay my code
[20:24:44] <foo> ?
[20:24:54] <LocalPCGuy> foo you need to create a function, and then call that function from the function that adds the form, after the form is added
[20:25:19] <LocalPCGuy> foo that is better than trying to guess (i.e. delay) how long before your code runs
[20:25:21] <foo> LocalPCGuy: ahh, I see
[20:25:29] <LocalPCGuy> foo do you know which file creates the form?
[20:25:40] <LocalPCGuy> foo ie, where that code is?
[20:26:43] <foo> LocalPCGuy: hm, not sure, let me do some digging. /me puts on snorkel
[20:27:05] <LocalPCGuy> foo good luck, from what I saw you'll be trudging through some deep @%&#
[20:27:17] <LocalPCGuy> (foo no offense intended, of course)
[20:27:20] <foo> LocalPCGuy: yeah, this code is crazy. :/ Fortunately I am on linux and have grep. :)
[20:31:08] <Wolfed> Noobish question, does getJSON expect a JSON response or does it expect whatever else?
[20:33:08] <foo> LocalPCGuy: found it. looks like this: http://pastebin.com/CByKeHY0
[20:34:00] <foo> LocalPCGuy: I could say: when URL matches /products/search/?q=kjasdfklasdfjas , take kjasdfklasdfjas and insert it into that part_number, hm
[20:35:41] <foo> LocalPCGuy: I could also add an id to this or something if it helped, hmm
[20:36:50] <LocalPCGuy> foo your selector is fine
[20:37:06] <Wolfed> I mean, I am trying to get this data and pass it to the tooltip, but isnt working for whatever reason: http://jsfiddle.net/T25UJ/
[20:37:11] <Wolfed> If anyone could help me I'd be happy ^^
[20:37:15] <foo> LocalPCGuy: I got it, you were right. :)
[20:37:22] <LocalPCGuy> cool
[20:37:25] <solarflares> guys
[20:37:27] <solarflares> im hungry
[20:37:32] <foo> LocalPCGuy: hm, only problem is this is a .js file, so I can't use php to parse the q= from the URL. /me googles how to do that
[20:37:41] <Wolfed> tooltip works for total answers
[20:38:15] <foo> LocalPCGuy: hm, looks like this might be tricky
[20:38:20] <solarflares> someone just told me that safari's developer tools are superior to chromes
[20:38:23] <LocalPCGuy> foo this is a bit yucky, but you can add a variable to the page(prior to where that JS file is called) with the value of q, and then reference that var where you need that value
[20:38:47] <solarflares> ew
[20:38:54] <LocalPCGuy> foo oh, wait - if it is in the URL you can just get the value with JS
[20:39:02] <solarflares> !!!
[20:39:09] <LocalPCGuy> foo I was thinking it was in server side land
[20:39:12] <foo> LocalPCGuy: yeah, I know PHP it's $_GET['x']
[20:39:21] <foo> LocalPCGuy: Trying to research to figure out what it is in JS
[20:39:32] <foo> LocalPCGuy: it's always like this: /?q=kjasdfklasdfjas
[20:39:32] <solarflares> oh so I heard that codecademy's php courses flopped
[20:39:52] <LocalPCGuy> foo http://stackoverflow.com/a/901144/228429
[20:41:21] <foo> LocalPCGuy: perfect, thanks a ton. :)
[20:41:41] <LocalPCGuy> foo np
[20:44:47] <LocalPCGuy> btw, we launched an internal project website today: yearlyme.com if anyone feels like checking it out
[20:45:47] <LocalPCGuy> used some jquery UI, and there is some really oldish yucky code in there too, so don't judge too harshly (I did not create all of it, and many of the parts I did do were over a year ago, it was on "pause" for a while)
[20:47:25] <solarflares> RESET OR NORMALIZE GO
[20:47:40] <LocalPCGuy> custom mixture
[20:47:48] <LocalPCGuy> BACK
[20:47:52] <solarflares> I like reset
[20:48:11] <LocalPCGuy> Normalize is nice, but some things just need to be reset
[20:48:12] <solarflares> everything works the way I want it too then, but I end up writing a lot more css
[20:48:17] <Wolfed> oh how dumb, figured it out finally
[20:48:33] <solarflares> cause I dont always remember all the quirks
[20:53:09] <solarflares> man working at a startup has become a blur of coffee, sushi, beer, and programming, its really fun
[21:00:46] <meese> I'm going to write a script that takes specific text from one HTML document and inserts it in another. Basically, the source doc has certain text within <span>'s and some within <td>'s. I then want to take the text and insert it into specific <div>'s (if I need to use some sort of other tag to help with the copying, that's fine). What's the best way to go about a script that looks for certain HTML tags, copies the text within them
[21:00:47] <meese>  to a specific place in another doc, and switches to copying into different types of divs when it runs into certain text (some HTML tag or just some word or something like that)? Thanks!
[21:02:13] <LocalPCGuy> meese you could put together a sample script at jsfiddle and we can help you refine the code from there
[21:02:33] <meese> LocalPCGuy: Got any suggestions on directions to go for this?
[21:02:40] <meese> what functions to look into, etc?
[21:03:50] <LocalPCGuy> load() seems promising ?load @ meese
[21:04:01] <tw2113> man, coldhead is missing some good tweets, and they're not RTs
[21:04:28] <LocalPCGuy> `load
[21:04:28] <b-ot> LocalPCGuy: like an .get but with the possibility to choose section to load (like with anchor)
[21:04:34] <LocalPCGuy> `load @ meese
[21:04:34] <b-ot> meese: like an .get but with the possibility to choose section to load (like with anchor)
[21:04:47] <meese> ooh
[21:04:51] <meese> that sounds interesting
[21:04:55] <meese> thanks, LocalPCGuy !
[21:04:55] <gavilan2> question: why does jquery like putting thousands of "functions" into a single function and then choosing them using a "name"?
[21:04:58] <LocalPCGuy> yup
[21:05:16] <LocalPCGuy> gavilan2 show me where there are thousands?
[21:05:56] <gavilan2> well, some? :)
[21:06:02] <Wolfed> Despite there being no documentation on it, I am assuming the option to set a delay on the tooltip call is there, or is there no built-in way to add a delay to the tooltip call?
[21:06:23] <gavilan2> $("#something").plugin("start", {...});
[21:06:26] <gavilan2> $("#something").plugin("stop", {...});
[21:06:30] <gavilan2> $("#something").plugin("configure", {...});
[21:06:32] <gavilan2> and etc....
[21:06:36] <LocalPCGuy> 686 "function" in the source
[21:07:08] <sahbeewah> wow, didn't know .load() did that...
[21:07:29] <sahbeewah> seems rather unuseful though
[21:07:29] <LocalPCGuy> `delay @ Wolfed
[21:07:46] <LocalPCGuy> Wolfed delay ONLY works on animations though
[21:08:12] <LocalPCGuy> gavilian2 what should jQuery do?
[21:08:55] <Wolfed> I am not looking for an animation delay, but rather have the mouse over the tooltip'ed selector for X seconds before showing it.
[21:08:57] <gavilan2> LocalPCGuy: First I wanna know why it does that... May be there is an excellent reason, and it should do that... That's why I'm asking....
[21:09:18] <LocalPCGuy> gavilan2 by putting all of the functions inside jQuery, it name-spaces the functions so only jQuery (and $ if not in noConflict) are in the global scope
[21:09:19] <tw2113> WWjQD ?
[21:09:20] <solarflares> http://www.lookingatsomething.com/
[21:09:23] <Wolfed> if I hover my mouse quickly over an instance I get stuck with the tooltip forever until I hover back into it
[21:09:27] <Wolfed> Kinda annoying sometimes
[21:09:42] <Wolfed> I get stuck with 10 tooltips at times
[21:10:22] <LocalPCGuy> Wolfed you could look into .stop()
[21:10:24] <gavilan2> LocalPCGuy: why not use $.plugin.stuff({ more stuff})?
[21:10:50] <LocalPCGuy> gavilan2 for what? core functions?
[21:10:52] <gavilan2> $.plugin.start({element: "#something", blah blah})
[21:11:00] <Wolfed> I could do a workaround for this, but I figured there would be a built-in way to do that, since it happens a lot to me at least, not sure about everyone else
[21:11:11] <LocalPCGuy> Wolfed look at stop()
[21:11:24] <gavilan2> that would also work... my question is... is there any reason why the choose the first one, and not the second one? and probably not a third one that I haven't yet realized?
[21:11:29] <Wolfed> Yeah I got that, no builtin :P Thanks
[21:11:49] <solarflares> its a great day its ag reat day
[21:11:51] <solarflares> its friday
[21:11:56] <LocalPCGuy> Wolfed what do you mean, no builtin?  stop is part of the animate code
[21:11:59] <solarflares> its star trek day
[21:13:05] <LocalPCGuy> gavilan2 seems more complicated to do $.plugin.something over $.something
[21:14:20] * LocalPCGuy shrugs
[21:14:20] <b-ot> LocalPCGuy: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[21:14:23] <gavilan2> LocalPCGuy $.plugin.something("#blah") would actually be replacing $("#blah").plugin("something")    $("#blah").something could be equivalent to $.something("#blah")
[21:16:06] <LocalPCGuy> gavilan2 you can write plugins that work like that.  Is your actual question about why jQuery doesn't do that, your examples aren't helping clear up what you are trying to ask
[21:17:27] <gavilan2> LocalPCGuy: My question is if they did it that way for a specific reason, or they just throwed a coin and choosed to do it that way because of the coin....
[21:18:08] <LocalPCGuy> gavilan2 the example you list would not work as well in JavaScript, it wouldn't be as flexible
[21:19:55] <LocalPCGuy> gavilan2 each .something is a function name, and while it is easy to pass parameters to functions, it is not as easy to dynamically adjust function names
[21:20:44] <gavilan2> LocalPCGuy: what do you mean as "dynamically adjust function names"?
[21:24:53] <LocalPCGuy> gavilan2 your examples are not equivilent to each other, in one you are passing a string as a parameter.  Generally parameters can be dynamic.  You then reference the same text that was in the string as a function name.  function names are not generally dynamic (they generally are predefined)
[21:27:05] <Wolfed> since when is :hover not a supported pseudo-selector on jquery?
[21:27:28] <LocalPCGuy> wolfed since never
[21:27:40] <Wolfed> Why is it complaining it isnt then :(
[21:27:56] <LocalPCGuy> ?:hover
[21:27:57] <bot-t> LocalPCGuy, .hover() | jQuery API Documentation - Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[21:28:02] <Wolfed> "Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: unsupported pseudo: hover"
[21:28:08] <LocalPCGuy> ?:hover @ Wolfed
[21:28:08] <bot-t> Wolfed, .hover() | jQuery API Documentation - Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[21:28:29] <Wolfed> thats coming off an .is(':hover')
[21:29:15] <LocalPCGuy> Wolfed ahh...right, that was deprecated in v1.8
[21:29:32] <Wolfed> Damn it -_-
[21:29:33] <LocalPCGuy> Wolfed just use 'mouseenter mouseleave'
[21:29:48] <LocalPCGuy> Wolfed http://stackoverflow.com/a/12517725/228429
[21:29:52] <myakura> it's removed in 1.9 http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#hover-pseudo-event
[21:30:23] <LocalPCGuy> Wolfed When the event name "hover" is used, the event subsystem converts it to "mouseenter mouseleave" in the event string. This is annoying for several reasons:
[21:30:26] <gavilan2> k, thanks
[21:30:31] <LocalPCGuy> Wolfed http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11731
[21:30:43] <Wolfed> Thing is I just need to to know if $(this) is currently hovered
[21:30:49] <Wolfed> Not to call something when enetering/leaving
[21:31:13] <Wolfed> (Trying to find a workaround for those tooltip issues)
[21:31:44] <LocalPCGuy> Wolfed might be better to fix the code generating errant tooltips rather than trying to patch by detecting the mouse position
[21:32:08] <Wolfed> What do you mean by errant tooltips?
[21:32:24] <LocalPCGuy> you said it was generating too many tooltips
[21:32:29] <LocalPCGuy> yes?
[21:32:43] <Wolfed> It is generating tooltips and not destroying them rather
[21:32:54] <LocalPCGuy> Wolfed> I get stuck with 10 tooltips at times
[21:33:08] <Wolfed> Because it is not destroying them always
[21:33:12] <Wolfed> Just sometimes
[21:33:30] <LocalPCGuy> so seems like it would be better to figure out that rather than patching it so it doesn't generate new ones
[21:34:03] <Wolfed> Oh well, of course
[21:34:37] <Wolfed> Thing is I don't know why is this happening to me to even start figuring it out/report it :P
[21:35:57] <LocalPCGuy> seems like a good challenge
[21:37:16] <LocalPCGuy> and it'll be better to fix the underlying issue rather than patching it and pushing onto the next time
[21:48:05] <dcope> Is it possible to have a drag n drop form within a normal, multi file form?
[21:56:41] <didiergm> how would you go to progressively populate a table as the user requests it by scrolling to the bottom of the table ?
[21:57:32] <didiergm> I mean how can I tell that the users scrolled to the bottom of the table
[22:12:12] <solarflares> so some people were arguing and then capt picard was like i HEREBY DECLARE THAT ALL DISAGREEMENTS ARE RESOLVED
[22:12:17] <solarflares> and everyone was like oh okay
[22:25:20] <Braden`> When does .ready() trigger?
[22:25:33] <Braden`> $(document).ready(function() {
[22:26:45] <LocalPCGuy> `ready @ Braden`
[22:26:45] <b-ot> Braden`: called as soon as the DOM tree is parsed.
[22:27:16] <wilornel1> Braden: what about the docs, did you read them?
[22:27:29] <LocalPCGuy> nobody RTFM
[22:27:34] <Braden`> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[22:27:38] <Braden`> Thats what I am reading
[22:28:03] <wilornel1> Dude thats the ajax function, you want http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[22:28:16] <LocalPCGuy> Braden` http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[22:28:31] <LocalPCGuy> err...guess I should look and see that was already posted
[22:29:04] <Braden`> Thanks :)
[22:29:27] <didiergm> hello iI asked that question but got disconnected so don"t know if anyone answered apologies.
[22:29:27] <didiergm> I mean how can I tell that the users scrolled to/past the bottom of the table in order to add data via ajax wgen the user requires it
[22:30:23] <wilornel1> okay so you want your ajax function to be called when the user requires it or when he scrolls past a certain point?
[22:30:31] <LocalPCGuy> didiergm  you can listen for the scroll event and check the position of the window vs. the position of the table and once the bottom of the table is above the bottom of the window (or maybe a hair before) you call your ajax function
[22:30:46] <wilornel1> ^
[22:31:05] <LocalPCGuy> didiergm you may also want to "debounce" your scroll even handler so that it isn't called every single time the scroll event fires, but only every 100ms or so
[22:32:32] <didiergm> localPCGuy sounds pretty slick and would clearly work; thanks for the pointer I didn't know how to start tackling this :)
[22:33:49] <didiergm> that could be interesting in JQM with fixed footers ;) will see how it goes
[22:34:02] <LocalPCGuy> didiergm np, there are some plugins that do some of this checking for you and can fire events when an element hits/passes a specific point, but they have been a bit flaky in my experience
[22:34:25] <LocalPCGuy> ugh, JQM in the mix as well...good luck!
[22:34:28] <LocalPCGuy> :P
[22:36:05] <didiergm> I looked at jQuery Waypoints but somehow it didn't feel right; thanks for the good luck charm ;)
[22:39:06] <Braden`> `always
[22:39:09] <LocalPCGuy> Waypoints was actually the main one I looked at
[22:39:22] <LocalPCGuy> never worked "quite" right
[22:39:24] <Braden`> `always`
[22:39:30] <Braden`> ...
[22:39:34] <Braden`> `always @ Braden`
[22:40:05] <Braden`> I guess the bot doesn't like me
[22:42:02] <LocalPCGuy> 'love Braden`
[22:42:05] <LocalPCGuy> nope
[22:42:09] <LocalPCGuy> `love Braden`
[22:42:17] <LocalPCGuy> no love from bot
[22:42:26] <LocalPCGuy> bo-t do you love Braden`?
[22:42:44] <LocalPCGuy> b-ot do you love Braden`?
[22:42:44] <b-ot> LocalPCGuy: concentrate and ask again.
[22:42:47] <LocalPCGuy> b-ot do you love Braden`?
[22:42:49] <b-ot> LocalPCGuy: very doubtful.
[22:42:54] <LocalPCGuy> yup, no love
[22:56:09] <solarflares> im spartacus hiya clank clank squirt
[22:56:15] <solarflares> yahhhhhhhrggg
[22:56:41] <solarflares> its like these roman soliders trained their entire lives to die cinematically
[22:56:41] <Braden`> If I construct a callback using $.ajax.  How do I use $.post so that I can submit it and it won't block while waiting for the response?
[22:56:48] <Braden`> Or am I understanding it incorrectly?
[23:02:01] <tw2113> wheee
[23:02:57] <tw2113> i love the $
[23:02:59] <Braden`> Anyone?
[23:04:33] <sacho_> Braden`, you don't construct callbacks via ajax, so I'm not sure what you mean
[23:05:03] <Braden`> sacho_:  Before I was using $.post, but if I understand it right, post is not asyncronous?
[23:05:22] <sacho_> it can be
[23:05:26] <coldhead> post and ajax do the same thing
[23:05:32] <coldhead> ajax is just a more long winded way
[23:05:49] <coldhead> you should only need one or the other
[23:05:53] <Braden`> Oh
[23:05:59] <Braden`> $.post is non-blocking then?
[23:06:05] <coldhead> post is async
[23:06:08] <Braden`> Ok
[23:06:21] <coldhead> unless you disable that
[23:06:22] <sacho_> there's examples how to use them in the jquery docs
[23:06:25] <coldhead> but never disable that
[23:06:30] <tw2113> *hugs coldhead*
[23:07:15] <Braden`> Is it good practice to always nest all ajax functionality inside of $(document).ready ?
[23:08:51] <tw2113> depends on if it's needed only after the DOM is ready or not
[23:17:16] <solarflares> man khan academy has changed quite a bit in the past year or so
[23:22:41] <sacho_> they got funding
[23:23:00] <amirite> ur a khan academy
[23:23:02] <sacho_> the gates push :)
[23:32:47] <djQuery> kinda dead
[23:33:39] <solarflares> yeah im tempted to start getting into math now
[23:33:47] <solarflares> i mean you get badges
[23:33:48] <solarflares> i love badges
[23:36:20] <sqwk> Has someone seen jquery tabs duplicate the entire html on refresh, but behave perfectly normal when the page is loaded via a referrer or by typing in the url?
[23:38:12] <clu3> hello all, i'm having an overlay div {opacity: 0.3;  background-color: #000000;z-index: 999;position: fixed;} overlaying the whole page, yet i want some div to be highlighted and raise above the overlay by setting its z-index to be 1000 but it is still under the overlay. Any help pls?
[23:38:58] <djQuery> clu3, have you looked at the way that ?ui.dialog
[23:39:05] <djQuery> does the same thing?
[23:40:24] <clu3> no, I'll have a look now but it's not a dialog, the div that i wanna raise above the overlay is already on the page, i'm just trying to make it appear "brighter"
[23:40:35] <clu3> @djQuery
[23:41:10] <djQuery> clu3, still sounds like what a modal dialog or light box  are doing
[23:48:44] <clu3> djQuery, please take a look at this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/9Kdpv/ . I wanna the whole red box to be normal looking, i.e it is not shadowed by that grayish overlay color
[23:52:23] <clu3> http://jsfiddle.net/9Kdpv/3/ is a probably better version
[23:57:26] <solarflares> need to position it
[23:57:35] <solarflares> make the #red position relative
[23:57:56] <clu3> solarflares, thanks, that works..
[23:58:42] <clu3> but I am trying to use this in order to help user see what the boxes are in my page, so i can't really do that. The divs are already what they are on the page, is there another way to do it?
[23:59:03] <solarflares> you cant position it?
[23:59:08] <solarflares> that doesnt make sense
