[00:01:15] <Chel> what a strange error: console.log($.parseJSON(data)) works, and data = $.parseJSON(data) doesn't
[00:02:35] <Chel> so don't worry about it :D
[00:04:55] <coldhead> bizarre
[00:05:41] <sviatovigt> coldhead: thank you
[00:06:06] <sviatovigt> I have tried that, but it doesn't really slides down
[00:06:19] <sviatovigt> it's more like a... spanpping
[00:06:24] <sviatovigt> snapping
[00:07:17] <coldhead> do you got a demo online, sviatovigt ?
[00:08:36] <sviatovigt> unfortunately no
[00:08:46] <sviatovigt> I don't have an online domain yet
[00:12:13] <kurol> :O
[00:14:54] <juha_> jsfiddle dude
[00:21:30] <coldhead> take down your art
[00:22:00] <coldhead> laser beams telescopes dictate directions
[00:22:01] <Koganei> take down your heart
[00:22:10] <coldhead> modify the beaten path
[00:22:54] <Koganei> she's waiting for this
[00:23:49] <coldhead> :D
[00:32:16] <billy_> $.mobile.changepage("registration.html"); when i am using this to change the page then the page on ready or other events like button click etc.. are no working
[00:32:39] <billy_> please suggest me why events are not working
[00:40:13] <coldhead> billy_: the best people to ask about that are all asleep :(
[00:40:30] <coldhead> i would try in #jQuerymobile and wait patiently
[00:40:54] <billy_> coldhead : Okey
[00:43:58] <mindis|wurk> somehow that sounds a lot like the common problem with loading dynamic content
[00:46:45] <tPl0ch> Hi, what could be the problem that jquery 1.4.2 is reporting a height of 0 while other browsers (IE7, IE9, FF and Chrome) are reporting the correct height (1745px). I tried height(), outerHeight() and innerHeight(), but everything is returning 0
[00:46:54] <tPl0ch> the browser in charge is IE8
[00:48:34] <tPl0ch> This is an iFrame resize method, that calls the parent window resize method.
[00:58:45] <jarco> http://jsfiddle.net/CZTdv/
[00:58:51] <jarco> why does this have output :s
[00:59:13] <jarco> the result of the console.log is 71 in my case
[00:59:22] <jarco> but it shouldn't be able to log that ...
[01:00:00] <mindis|wurk> why not
[01:00:21] <jarco> 71 > 60 so the if statement should be false
[01:00:59] <mindis|wurk> try logging the length before you make the if
[01:01:29] <jarco> also 71
[01:01:40] <mindis|wurk> oh right, the selectors are different
[01:01:51] <mindis|wurk> your if statement has samen instead of .samen
[01:01:57] <jarco> auch
[01:02:04] <jarco> awefull mistake :D
[01:03:17] <jarco> thank mindis|wurk. I am very humiliated now.
[01:03:18] <coldhead> happens to the best of us!
[01:03:18] <jarco> :p
[01:03:23] <coldhead> take heart
[01:03:55] <jarco> I should have looked for that. But I am lucjy to have an excuse. Its only my 4th day into jquery :p
[01:03:59] <jarco> lucky*
[01:05:42] <RahulKumar> jarco : what is your question exactly?
[01:06:10] <coldhead> jarco: you're still learning what are the common/obvious things to check for with jQuery bugs :)
[01:06:38] <coldhead> jarco: this is a good short entertaining read http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[01:07:11] <jarco> RahulKumar: Its solved thanks.
[01:07:36] <RahulKumar> Okey np:)
[01:08:58] <jarco> coldhead: very nice :)
[01:10:54] <jarco> wow very nice indeed. ?
[01:11:00] <jarco> Never knew about breakpoints
[01:13:17] <coldhead> there's years of expertise in that presentation
[01:15:03] <mindis|wurk> console.log is pretty much my only debugging tool
[01:15:33] <jarco> yeah. I am installing the addon it suggested and am trying to se how I can imporve my debugging
[01:15:59] <jarco> jquery lint is important? Because the link from the article 404's
[01:16:08] <coldhead> ?jshint
[01:16:09] <bot-t1> http://jshint.com/
[01:16:18] <coldhead> that's a gentler alternative anyway
[01:16:35] <coldhead> some people run all their code through it, i mostly just paste code into it if i can't find a bug
[01:16:44] <blackspotwiggins> jquery lint is super OCD level tool IMO
[01:16:50] <coldhead> good for trailing commas
[01:17:09] <jarco> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide19
[01:17:22] <jarco> the tool is referenced there
[01:17:57] <tPl0ch> Hi, what could be the problem that jquery 1.4.2 + IE8 is reporting a height of 0 while other browsers (IE7, IE9, FF and Chrome) are reporting the correct height (1745px). I tried height(), outerHeight() and innerHeight(), but everything is returning 0
[01:18:41] <mindis|wurk> i wouldn't be surprised if it was simply the ancient jquery version
[01:19:38] <fRAiLtY-> Why do I get nextShipDate is undefined here: http://pastie.org/4203156
[01:21:07] <coldhead> bot-t1: tell ajpiano the link to jQuery-lint in http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide19 is dead :(
[01:21:07] <bot-t1> coldhead, Okay.
[01:21:13] <coldhead> bot-t1: thanks
[01:21:15] * bot-t1 sighs
[01:21:25] <coldhead> bot-t1: you little cutie
[01:21:26] <bot-t1> coldhead, Is that a question?
[01:21:49] <coldhead> bot-t1: are you a little cutie?
[01:21:49] <bot-t1> coldhead, It is decidedly so.
[01:22:19] <coldhead> tPl0ch: i don't know why that is. can you reproduce it in jsfiddle and test against other jQuery versions there?
[01:23:29] <blackspotwiggins> i think live/bind should be updated to on() as well
[01:23:33] <blackspotwiggins> in the slides
[01:24:10] <mindis|wurk> definitely
[01:24:10] <coldhead> ajpiano: ^^
[01:24:14] <Cork> tPl0ch: have you tried the normal ie hasLayout hacks?
[01:24:35] <coldhead> fRAiLtY-: because you are adding nextShipDate to the Date prototype and calling it as a global
[01:24:40] <coldhead> it's not a global
[01:24:47] <coldhead> you need a Date() instance to call it on
[01:25:40] <fRAiLtY-> coldhead:  So like var despatchText = new Date().nextShipDate(dayCount).displayDate(); ?
[01:26:15] <coldhead> that might work!
[01:27:25] <fRAiLtY-> coldhead:  It does, ledge.
[01:27:35] <coldhead> sweet as, bro
[01:28:12] <fRAiLtY-> coldhead:  One last thing, without sounding like Columbo, how can I make nextShipDate function accept 0 as a day count, 0 and 1 do the same thing. I was hoping 0 = today, 1 = tomorrow, except 0 = tomorrow and 1 = tomorrow :x
[01:29:08] <mindis|wurk> mmm dates
[01:29:14] * mindis|wurk brings the razor blade to his wrist
[01:30:12] <coldhead> my brain is refusing to deal with dates at this point sorry fRAiLtY-
[01:30:19] <fRAiLtY-> :(
[01:30:21] <coldhead> been fighting them in JS and PHP all day >: \
[01:30:31] <coldhead> someone here will now!
[01:30:37] <coldhead> know*
[01:30:42] * coldhead points at blackspotwiggins 
[01:30:52] <blackspotwiggins> wo-what?
[01:30:55] <fRAiLtY-> how can I make nextShipDate function accept 0 as a day count, 0 and 1 do the same thing. I was hoping 0 = today, 1 = tomorrow, except 0 = tomorrow and 1 = tomorrow :x http://pastie.org/4203156
[01:31:18] <blackspotwiggins> err
[01:31:50] <blackspotwiggins> you know what i'd do?
[01:32:06] <blackspotwiggins> make a really bigass array of valid dates
[01:32:13] <blackspotwiggins> and just use index offsets
[01:32:34] <fRAiLtY-> sigh
[01:33:19] <blackspotwiggins> that code doesnt look very futureproof tho
[01:33:29] <|Freeman|> anyone could tell me what $(function() {  ......... }); does?
[01:33:48] <blackspotwiggins> |Freeman|, same as $(document).ready(function() { ........ });
[01:33:56] <fRAiLtY-> blackspotwiggins:  It get's me out of a hole for now
[01:34:05] <fRAiLtY-> I just need to get today with 0 as oppose to tomororw
[01:34:07] <fRAiLtY-> then I'm home free
[01:34:59] <|Freeman|> blackspotwiggins: thanks a lot :)
[01:43:50] <Rudeboy_> I'm adding a fade out to my pages, but how do I get the next page to load only AFTER the fade out is complete?
[01:44:22] <sviatovigt> use the callback
[01:45:06] <Nece228> hello
[01:45:19] <Nece228> how to apply validation for empty spaces in a form
[01:45:31] <Nece228> i currently use this: if ($(this).val() == '')
[01:46:03] <bitbuzzer> hi, I'm looking for a good context menu plugin. any recommendations?
[01:46:45] <Rudeboy_> sviatovigt: Thank you :)
[01:48:30] <sviatovigt> np
[01:50:32] <jarco> ajpiano: Thank you very much for creating your slideshow on http://fixingthesejquery.com/. I really appreciate your effort and salute you sir. I will do my very best not te be a help vampire :)
[01:51:43] <fRAiLtY-> What's wrong here, it does nothing http://jsfiddle.net/gjWGY/
[01:52:12] <fRAiLtY-> I've checked, dayCount returns 0
[01:52:23] <fRAiLtY-> So it should process
[01:53:07] <sviatovigt> you haven't defined dayCount
[01:53:18] <fRAiLtY-> It's defined earlier on
[01:53:19] <sviatovigt> var dayCount
[01:53:27] <sviatovigt> where?
[01:53:28] <fRAiLtY-> I've debugged up until this if statement
[01:53:32] <fRAiLtY-> sec
[01:53:39] <sviatovigt> in the code you poseted it's not
[01:54:14] <fRAiLtY-> sviatovigt:  http://jsfiddle.net/gjWGY/1/
[01:54:31] <fRAiLtY-> I've debugged with console.log up until the if statement
[01:54:34] <fRAiLtY-> and dayCount returns 0
[01:54:38] <fRAiLtY-> as it should
[01:55:20] <nathan7> Okay, I'm using jqueryui to make a buttonset from a bunch of radio inputs
[01:55:35] <nathan7> And it is adding ui-corner-left to the rightmost button.
[01:55:54] <nathan7> so I have to do
[01:55:54] <nathan7>                         labels=$('label',radiodiv[0]).removeClass('ui-corner-left');
[01:55:58] <nathan7>                         $(labels[labels.length-1]).addClass('ui-corner-right');
[01:56:00] <nathan7>                         $(labels[0]).addClass('ui-corner-left');
[01:56:00] <nathan7> to fix everything up
[01:56:26] <fRAiLtY-> sviatovigt:  The console.logs in the if statement never fire
[01:57:16] <nathan7> This seems like a bug to me, I don't see any way this could be created by my code
[01:57:21] <sviatovigt> because you haven't defined dayCount
[01:57:35] <sviatovigt> if you console.log(dayCount);
[01:57:42] <sviatovigt> dayCount is undefined
[01:57:45] <sviatovigt> that's why
[01:58:36] <nathan7> but the buttonset example on the jqueryui site does not exhibit this behaviour
[01:58:46] <fRAiLtY-> sviatovigt:  Where did you place the console.log
[01:58:54] <sviatovigt> just a sec
[01:59:22] <sviatovigt> http://jsfiddle.net/gjWGY/8/
[01:59:25] <sviatovigt> take a look
[01:59:47] <nathan7> ..disregard me, .21 fixed it
[02:17:55] <Rudeboy_> sviatovigt: Is this right? http://pastebin.com/Xb0tLXuu
[02:18:13] <Rudeboy_> sviatovigt: I'm not sure what's preventing it from working properly
[02:19:45] <johnline> COME HERE RUDE BOY BOY IS YOU BIG ENOUGH
[02:20:19] <Rudeboy_> johnline: Ha ha is that a song?
[02:20:30] <johnline> fraid so
[02:20:35] <fuchstronaut> Yea, it's Madonnas latest
[02:20:53] <johnline> ribena's*
[02:21:00] <Rudeboy_> ha ha ha :)
[02:21:15] <johnline> http://bbqfiles.com/u/ribena_813a.jpg
[02:21:46] <fuchstronaut> I like the video they made for this song
[02:21:48] <fuchstronaut> it's so 1992
[02:22:21] <fuchstronaut> I wonder if the animations made in html5
[02:22:27] <johnline> i take comfort in the knowledge that if i ever get extensive braindamagem there will be some music which i can still enjoy
[02:22:27] <mindis|wurk> that pic amuses me every time
[02:22:27] <Rudeboy_> Ha ha ha ha
[02:22:49] <johnline> maybe i already have braindamagem
[02:22:54] <Rudeboy_> "Music" nowadays is reason for concern
[02:23:00] <johnline> toly
[02:23:13] <johnline> no moral compass, do anything you can to grab attention
[02:24:40] <fuchstronaut> like it was different 50 years ago
[02:24:44] <fuchstronaut> or at any time
[02:24:59] <fuchstronaut> "artists" just got a bigger audience thanks to mtv and youtube
[02:25:31] <johnline> i think it was quite different, guys went out to dance w/ girls
[02:26:06] <johnline> now guys go out to get pusssiie
[02:26:23] <mindis|wurk> they danced so that they could get pussy
[02:26:27] <fuchstronaut> I'd say it just wasn't accepted to say you where out for pussy
[02:26:31] <fuchstronaut> in the end it all comes down to :P
[02:26:41] <fuchstronaut> but that's ok
[02:26:50] <johnline> probably, but it was just more tasteful and less sinister
[02:27:00] <Rudeboy_> I second that
[02:27:10] <Rudeboy_> a LOT more tasteful
[02:27:26] <fuchstronaut> on the other hand it is easier to get some sexy time now
[02:27:28] <Rudeboy_> Music videos now are on the verge of soft porn
[02:27:33] <fuchstronaut> i appriciate that
[02:27:50] <fuchstronaut> i=e
[02:27:57] <Zhy> appreceate ?:P
[02:28:11] <johnline> apricot !
[02:28:14] <Zhy> plum!
[02:28:15] <Rudeboy_> Is there a way to stop the background image from reloading on a page refresh? To stop it flickering on every page load
[02:28:21] <fuchstronaut> apricot, and where with pussys again..
[02:28:28] <Zhy> ._.
[02:28:33] <anli_> God, I had the translation bar in chrome
[02:28:50] <anli_> just had to say that because #chrome is not available...
[02:29:47] <Zhy> anli_ you DO know that you can disable it, rite ?
[02:29:58] <anli_> Only for a certain language
[02:30:04] <anli_> I dont know anything else about it

[02:39:56] <ugoub> en. I want to konw if on('click.readonly.disabled  keydown.readonly.disabled',{obj:this},function(ev){})  is right or wrong.
[02:41:01] <mindis|wurk> i have no idea what that is supposed to be
[02:42:05] <ugoub> mindis|wurk:  I mean i'm not sure expression:'click.readonly.disabled  keydown.readonly.disabled' in function  : on can work or not.
[02:43:15] <mindis|wurk> i'm pretty sure it's entirely wrong
[02:44:41] <ugoub> mindis|wurk: en. I thought $(div).on('click.readonly,{obj:this},function(event){})  can work.
[02:45:44] <Posterdati> hi
[02:46:02] <Posterdati> please I need help to make galleriffic works in a jquery dialog
[02:46:46] <ugoub> mindis|wurk: you mean there's no way for me to bind click and mouseover with namespace at the same time to jqueryObj?
[02:51:12] <ugoub> if I wnat to bind click,mouseover with both namespace .readonly and .disabled  to $(div). How do I express in $(div).on() ?
[02:53:37] <ugoub> will this be ok?: $(div).on('click mouseover .readonly .disabled',{},function(){});
[02:56:25] <ugoub> or $(div).on('click.readonly.disabled mouseover.readonly.disabled',{},function(){}); ?
[03:02:21] <Rudeboy> I'm setting up a partial page reload using jQuery. I've got it to work so far, but now I'm trying to get the ".p" class to fade in. This is my code so far: http://pastebin.com/AVNJJfA7. Could someone possibly tell me where I'm going wrong?
[03:03:02] <Onkeltem> Hi. I'm looking for a library/tool to visualize and browse database schemas. Is there something jQuery-based like that?
[03:12:28] <xxtjaxx> Hi! Is there an event or css selector I could use to fire an event if a given tag/class/id is in the visible field of the webpage? like: scrollig down to item No. 43023 in my list triggers a isVisibleToUser event that load an image for the given item
[03:17:18] <Onkeltem> Is there a ERD visualization tool on jQuery?
[03:26:15] <globe_tmp> hi
[03:32:01] <Rudeboy> I've got the fade out to work, but how on earth do I get the fade in to work? I've tried many approaches, have this so far: http://pastebin.com/kfDCWZXb
[03:39:50] <Grundell> Can I remove a class from an div with an id=?
[03:41:10] <johnline> $('#div').removeClass('classname');
[03:42:03] <Grundell> johnline - i want to remove all classes from it and the attribute calss
[03:45:09] <Grundell> johnline - okay what i have is a list with <div class="1"> <div class="2"> <div id="a" class="3">, and its repeated 5 or six times i cant get rid of class3 from #a other than from the first one... any ideas ?
[03:45:17] <Posterdati> please I need help to make galleriffic works in a jquery dialog
[03:49:29] <Rudeboy> Please can someone tell me where I must put the ".fadeTo" command here: http://pastebin.com/7P9z2jWS ?
[03:49:40] <Rudeboy> I'm really struggling
[03:51:39] <sviatovigt> Rudeboy: what is you problem exactly?
[03:51:57] <sviatovigt> could you please paste your code on jsfiddle?
[03:52:17] <Rudeboy> sviatovigt: I just want the content to fade in. I've got it to fade out, but can't get fade in working. Ok, I'll do that now
[03:54:25] <Rudeboy> sviatovigt: Um, I'm not too sure how to put it on JSFiddle, cause it has dynamic pages
[03:54:47] <sviatovigt> you can put the generated html
[03:55:09] <sviatovigt> from what I've seen on pastebin, your previous post, there is no problem
[03:55:59] <Rudeboy> sviatovigt: As soon as I put the fade in command, both fade in and fade out stop working
[03:56:41] <Rudeboy> sviatovigt: Here is what I have so far: http://pastebin.com/kCSHpBZ3
[03:56:44] <sente> Rudeboy: you can post it to my server and it'll be automatically hosted, if you want
[03:56:47] <Rudeboy> sviatovigt: The fade out command is last
[03:57:33] <sviatovigt> Rudeboy: again, what's the problem
[03:57:38] <sviatovigt> cause I can't see any
[03:57:41] <sente> your indentation is all f'd up
[03:58:00] <sviatovigt> and if I can't test it at least, I can't help you
[03:58:08] <Rudeboy> Ha  ha sorry, I'll get better at it
[03:58:17] <Rudeboy> sviatovigt: So does the code look right then?
[03:58:30] <sviatovigt> yes, it does
[03:59:01] <sviatovigt> $("#content").fadeTo("fast",0);
[03:59:05] <sviatovigt> that is working
[03:59:07] <sviatovigt> right?
[03:59:35] <Rudeboy> Yes, that is working
[03:59:41] <sviatovigt> ok
[04:00:00] <sviatovigt> sto the one is not working is this: $("#content").fadeTo("slow",1);
[04:00:03] <sviatovigt> right?
[04:00:05] <Rudeboy> but as soon as I put the           		$("#content").fadeTo("slow",1);  in, it breaks the whole thing
[04:00:14] <Rudeboy> Yes, correct
[04:00:17] <fRAiLtY-> How do I do console.log(.val()) ?
[04:00:19] <sviatovigt> ok then
[04:00:26] <fRAiLtY-> want to log the val() in the console
[04:00:32] <sviatovigt> did you tried to debug the thing?
[04:00:41] <sviatovigt> you have a conditional block there
[04:00:45] <Rudeboy> That's why I'm thinking it's either in the wrong place, or $(window).load(function(){ is incorrect
[04:00:51] <sviatovigt> is getting to that part of the code?
[04:01:13] <Rudeboy> sviatovigt: I don't understand?
[04:01:23] <sviatovigt> the ajax request is working as you've expected to?
[04:01:46] <sviatovigt> the success inside the ajax request is like a condition
[04:01:51] <Rudeboy> sviatovigt: no, only the fade in request
[04:02:01] <sviatovigt> if the ajax is successfull
[04:02:16] <sviatovigt> then the command inside success will be executed
[04:02:31] <sviatovigt> do you get there?
[04:02:46] <sviatovigt> put a console.log("here") before $("#content").fadeTo("slow",1);
[04:02:51] <Rudeboy> sviatovigt: Ok, I'm following
[04:03:04] <sviatovigt> see it the code reaches that point
[04:03:55] <remysharp> Anyone know first hand whether $('.foo') uses document.getElementsByClassName under the hood (if available)?
[04:03:59] <Rudeboy> sviatovigt: Like so: http://pastebin.com/zs8UcLUe ?
[04:05:27] <Rudeboy> sviatovigt: Is that what you meant?
[04:05:34] <sviatovigt> Rudeboy: please take a look on the documentation
[04:05:46] <sviatovigt> no, that's not what I meant
[04:06:06] <Rudeboy> sviatovigt: Drats///what did you mean?
[04:07:29] <remysharp> forget actually, it doesn't matter - I'll ditch jQuery for getByClassName anyway.

[04:08:32] <fRAiLtY-> What jQuery function can I use to see if an element contains a text string/
[04:10:15] <Rudeboy> sviatovigt: Thanks. I put that in, but nothing is happening?
[04:11:24] <sviatovigt> then it means your ajax request is not succesfull
[04:12:42] <sviatovigt> *successful
[04:13:20] <Grundell> If i have <div class="a"> <div id="b"> / <div class="a"> <div id="b"> / <div class="a"> <div id="b"> can i remove all b
[04:13:24] <Grundell> 's?
[04:13:27] <Rudeboy> sviatovigt: Ah no...
[04:13:39] <sviatovigt> ah no... what?
[04:13:45] <Rudeboy> sviatovigt: So is the Ajax part the problem?
[04:13:45] <Grundell> Any one ?
[04:14:02] <sviatovigt> so it seams
[04:14:27] <fRAiLtY-> What jQuery function can I use to see if an element contains a text string/
[04:14:32] <sviatovigt> Grundell: what is your question?
[04:15:12] <Rudeboy> sviatovigt: Drats. Ok, thanks so much for your help :)
[04:15:33] <Grundell> Sviatorvigt - i have a loop with <div class ="a"> <div id="b"> i want to remove al the id's called B
[04:15:37] <devoth> Grundell: do you want to remove the id's and classes containing 'b' or remove the divs with ids and classes containing b?
[04:15:40] <Grundell> is that possibole ?
[04:16:07] <Grundell> I want to remove the id of div b
[04:16:08] <devoth> $('div.b, div#b').remove();
[04:16:24] <krismeld> hi, does anybody know how to manipulate the text within a div, so that x amount of characters are removed from the end of the string?
[04:16:35] <devoth> so you want to remove only the id attribute not the whole div?
[04:16:44] <Grundell> devoth - thats right
[04:17:01] <sviatovigt> fRAiLtY-: try this: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[04:17:03] <Grundell> devoth and i only get it to work with the first div ...
[04:17:29] <devoth> $('div#b').removeAttr('id');
[04:18:09] <Grundell> does it work if i have like 5 div#b ?
[04:18:10] <devoth> and well, id should only appear once in your code
[04:18:26] <devoth> so probably you want to use a class
[04:18:46] <devoth> or something like id="b_1", id="b_2", etc
[04:19:24] <fRAiLtY-> hmmm, how can I say if(jQuery(this).find('option:selected').text()) DOESN'T CONTAIN StandardX { do something }
[04:19:45] <Grundell> devoth - Yes, the thing is that I'm indexing a page with the whole html code from another page... and i need to remove all the ID's
[04:21:20] <sviatovigt> fRAiLtY-: did you read what I told you to read/
[04:21:22] <sviatovigt> ?
[04:21:39] <devoth> Grundell: I'm not sure what you mean by indexing, and how are you storing that page (as a DOM or string), if a string - maybe you should use something like replace()
[04:22:04] <zsoc> ugh, i'm going to injure myself.
[04:22:05] <sviatovigt> if(!jQuery(this).find('option:selected').text().contains("StandardX")){ do something }
[04:22:58] <zsoc> I have a select box whose options are displayed based on another select boxes option (for instance, you select country and the states change, etc). I need to remove one of the options in the second select box, but i need to do it obviously after it loads. Any ideas?
[04:23:50] <devoth> zsoc: trigger it on load :->
[04:24:12] <zsoc> devoth: i know in javascript you can't onload a select/option element... is there a method to do this in jquery?
[04:24:13] <Grundell> devoth - think i managed to change it to class ...
[04:24:22] <devoth> zsoc: I mean you probably get it from ajax or something
[04:24:56] <zsoc> devoth: probably?
[04:25:16] <devoth> how do you populate these select elements?
[04:25:17] <zsoc> its an external library, yeah
[04:25:34] <Zhy> krismeld http://jsfiddle.net/Yd2ny/3/
[04:26:01] <devoth> maybe that library has a trigger that launches after a select has been populated, if so, you can use it
[04:26:24] <krismeld> Zhy: thank you very much, just what i needed! :)
[04:26:52] <fRAiLtY-> sviatovigt:  if(!jQuery(this).find('option:selected').text().contains("StandardX")) just tells me that the text object has no method 'contains'
[04:26:55] <Zhy> you're welcome :)
[04:27:42] <zsoc> devoth: http://pastebin.com/tKcULequ <-- can i attach it to there somewhere? 'll' is the the $ alias
[04:28:24] <devoth> zsoc: yup it should go into the success function
[04:28:39] <devoth> probably inside that first IF
[04:29:02] <devoth> but that you'd have to check (i'm not sure what gets sent there)
[04:29:55] <Posterdati> please I need help to make galleriffic works in a jquery dialog
[04:30:24] <zsoc> hmmm ok.. and i'm using `ll("#select_id option[value=\'Select Field\']").remove();` <-- is that right or is there like a "remove first" i should be using.. like .eq(0)?
[04:32:22] <theoN^> How do I create an html element after the element I am currently working in? For instance, I want to add a line of text behind an input field ($(this) in my context)
[04:32:47] <devoth> ll('#select_id option:first').remove();
[04:33:25] <devoth> should work, but i'm not sure :)

[04:35:15] <sente> dygraph
[04:35:18] <sente> d3

[04:52:18] <tocka> google told me :(
[04:52:38] <joeytwiddle> krismeld: i'd guess you'll either need to walk down to the actual element holding the text, or edit the innerHTML instead
[04:52:43] <DeltaHeavy> tocka: .trigger?
[04:53:10] <DeltaHeavy> Where did you read to use .trigger over .click to make a click event?
[04:54:09] <tocka> nvm:]
[04:54:13] <tocka> thanks for help tho
[04:54:38] <varnie> Hi there.
[04:55:04] <varnie> I am experiencing a problem with .index() method. I don't get why it doesn't work in my simple example: http://jsfiddle.net/nzTFd/10/
[04:55:11] <krismeld> joeytwiddle, ty! so should i just replace the text() with html() in order to do that?
[04:55:36] <joeytwiddle> dunno krismeld, i've never used jQuery ;)
[04:55:47] <krismeld> hehe ok
[04:55:48] <varnie> when an item is clicked I use $(this).index(); but it returns 0 always.
[04:56:31] <varnie> nevermind, I found a bug ;)
[04:56:41] <varnie> my html layout is broken...
[04:57:07] <varnie> hmm..wait, no, it is correct.
[04:57:45] <DeltaHeavy> varnie: Make a jsfiddle if possible
[04:57:55] <varnie> here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/nzTFd/10/
[04:59:52] <varnie> $('.line-tabs-link').index(this); works. but $(this).index() does not.
[05:02:31] <DeltaHeavy> varnie: http://jsfiddle.net/nzTFd/11/
[05:02:43] <DeltaHeavy> Is this not what you want?
[05:03:00] <varnie> yes it is
[05:03:14] <varnie> thank you, DeltaHeavy.
[05:03:26] <varnie> I used .index() improperly.
[05:04:20] <DeltaHeavy> No problem
[05:04:23] <infinityartworx> so u abused .index
[05:04:59] <DeltaHeavy> so u abuse english
[05:05:19] <superman> sometimes i do. i'm sorry.
[05:06:09] <joeytwiddle> the real superman would never do that
[05:06:19] <Guest67720> lol
[05:07:54] <xec> varnie: just wanted to point out that the method works both ways http://jsfiddle.net/nzTFd/12/
[05:09:47] <xec> this is a contrived example, better would probably be to cache the collection that you attached the click handler to, something like i did with the "var links = ... "at the start there and use that instead of selecting all the anchors each time
[05:10:08] <fuchstronaut> when expecting a json back from the server and just echoing a string, will jquery fire the error-callback?
[05:10:24] <fRAiLtY-> why would  if(!jQuery(this).find('option:selected').text().contains("StandardX")) just tells me that the text object has no method 'contains'
[05:10:27] <xec> did jsfiddle just stop working?
[05:10:38] <varnie> yeah
[05:10:46] <xec> fRAiLtY-: .text() returns a string
[05:10:52] <fRAiLtY-> Yes
[05:11:13] <fRAiLtY-> I'm trying to check whether that string contains a specific substring
[05:11:16] <xec> fRAiLtY-: .contains() is not a string method ?
[05:11:33] <fRAiLtY-> Oh, what is more suitabel?
[05:11:34] <xec> or is it
[05:12:24] <xec> .indexOf() perhaps?
[05:12:30] <fuchstronaut> why does jquery fire the error callback, when the header is 200 OK?
[05:13:21] <xec> fRAiLtY-: but if you already have the <select> you can get its value prop rather than looking for the selected option
[05:13:43] <fRAiLtY-> xec:  I can't use values
[05:13:48] <fRAiLtY-> In this circumstnace
[05:14:18] <xec> right, i see, you actually want the text of the option instead
[05:14:27] <xec> ignore me in that case ;)
[05:16:06] <fRAiLtY-> xec: Yes, I want to retrieve the text of the option, then search within it for a substring
[05:16:14] <xec> ?eval "what".indexOf("hat") > -1
[05:16:17] <bot-t> xec: true
[05:16:37] <xec> ?eval "what".indexOf("troll") > -1
[05:16:38] <bot-t> xec: false
[05:18:57] <durre> could anyone recommend a feature detection javascript lib? right now I want to test for existence of overflow: scroll; on a mobile device
[05:18:57] <fRAiLtY-> so indexOf ?
[05:19:53] <xec> fRAiLtY-: if you just want to check if a substring is part of a string, yes, why not ;)
[05:20:01] <fRAiLtY-> Ok cool :P
[05:20:02] <fRAiLtY-> Thanks
[05:20:59] <xec> you could also do :contains() in the selector
[05:21:39] <Deele> how to catch event, when iframe has finished loading?
[05:22:04] <fRAiLtY-> xec: What do you think is best, as indexOf doesn't seem to trigger the console.log leading me to think it's not working http://jsfiddle.net/X5yh8/1/
[05:22:20] <fRAiLtY-> I'm trying to say, if the selected option doesn't contain StandardX, log to console
[05:23:01] <xec> fRAiLtY-:  you forgot the actual check, the comparison to the result
[05:23:21] <xec> fRAiLtY-: indexOf gives you a number, the position of the substring, or -1 if not found
[05:25:09] <fRAiLtY-> Hmm can you show me, bit confused :
[05:26:13] <xec> fRAiLtY-: did you see the examples i posted earlier?
[05:26:28] <xec> fRAiLtY-: note the "> -1" ?
[05:27:02] <xec> fRAiLtY-: you know what the > operator does? you can just as easily use != in this case though
[05:27:04] <fRAiLtY-> Hmm so just add >-1 to the end?
[05:27:07] <fRAiLtY-> greater than
[05:27:13] <fRAiLtY-> or not equal to !=
[05:27:35] <xec> right, i'm checking if the result from indexOf is greater than -1, simple as that
[05:27:44] <xec> and if it is, it means the string exists
[05:28:41] <xec> fRAiLtY-: you don't need the ! in front, if you want the opposite result you could do "==" or "< 0"
[05:29:06] <xec> makes sense, yes? :)
[05:29:28] <fRAiLtY-> xec:  Think so, testing now
[05:29:53] <xec> try testing with some simple strings first rather than putting it all together in one go
[05:30:40] <fRAiLtY-> Works!
[05:30:42] <fRAiLtY-> Wahaha
[05:30:47] <fRAiLtY-> Little victories

[05:39:09] <lilalinuxHamburg> and if not possible have some reference to it
[05:39:18] <jarco> add a function
[05:39:28] <lilalinuxHamburg> that.save is my function

[05:40:01] <lilalinuxHamburg> and I want "this" inside the function to resolve to the object the function is in
[05:41:10] <lilalinuxHamburg> jarco: yes, I could use an anonymous function, but what if I want the function to be callable from other places, too?
[05:42:10] <jarco> lilalinuxHamburg: sorry I do not know the answer then. I am only doing jquery for four days. Someone here will see it I am sure
[05:42:27] <lilalinuxHamburg> thx nevertheless
[05:42:45] <greek> Hey fellas. I have a <tr> with several <td>s, and I'd like to prepend a new <td> at the beginning of the row, but with a maximum of 10 <td>s, so that if I prepend an 11th <td>, the first inserted <td> gets removed (to enforce the maximum of 10). Is there a built-in way to do this or do I have to count the cells and remove the last one manually?
[05:43:35] <b8ab3> Hi, has anyone an idea about why this may not be working? http://jsfiddle.net/zXvYM/4/
[05:43:48] <lilalinuxHamburg> Here's the code: http://pastebin.com/3XMZabJ4
[05:44:29] <lilalinuxHamburg> GroupManager.save() is the method I'm talking about
[05:46:21] <ksprrrs> lilalinuxHamburg, you might want to check this http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/#82
[05:47:03] <DeltaHeavy> I have a for loop and a setTimeout function that's suppost to take the variable 'i' from "for (i=0; i < something; i++)". setTimeout seems to take the value of 'i' after the 50 ms delay I have so it would come up as 2 every time if that's what 'i' would be at the end of the loop. Anybody know how I can get the value for 'i' I want? http://pastebin.com/1MBz6Lwq
[05:49:45] <ksprrrs> im using that solution for being able to have methods as event handlers and still use the this of the object. Like so: $("#browseInput").bind("click", this.onClickBrowse.bind(this));
[05:50:20] <lilalinuxHamburg> thank you
[05:51:05] <greek> Any idea why this isn't working as I expect it to? (I have described problem in my previous message) - http://pastie.org/4204095
[05:51:40] <greek> It's prepending just fine, but fails to remove the last element when maximum reached
[05:53:58] <greek> it seems the if($("tr#recent").length == "5") bit isn't even working
[05:54:04] <greek> (debugging with alerts)
[05:54:21] <greek> nothing showing up in my firebug
[05:55:30] <greek> ok this did the trick, although I find it confusing that my selector is counting the length of the td cell if that makes sense... if($("tr#recent td").length == "5")
[05:57:43] <theoN^> isn't jquery extend supposed to merge objects into a new object? When I extend two of my objects, my defaults change ...
[05:57:50] <theoN^> for example: var opts = $.extend($.fn.myFunc.defaults , options);
[05:58:26] <theoN^> when I pass options, it will change my $.fn.myFunc.defaults ... while it should only affect the one initialisation of the opts var ... am I forgetting something?
[05:58:35] <Haprog> read the manual
[05:59:03] <Haprog> it extends the first parameter modifying it, unless the first parameter is boolean true iirc.

[06:00:14] <theoN^> Haprog, oh shit, I forgot to pass an empty object ...
[06:00:54] <theoN^> yeah, thanks for the obvious help, in my mind it had the empty object in the extend, but apparently forgot to place it there in writing

[06:25:33] <greek> With jquery-ui, using draggable, I've made the td cells in my row draggable and it's working fine. However if I dynamically prepend another td cell, the new cell isn't draggable (despite having the correct class to work with the draggable selector). The only way I've gotten it to work is by calling .draggable(...) again on the whole row. Is this the normal way to do things?

[06:31:57] <danzik17> dorgan: no, .bind just calls .on
[06:34:55] <dorgan> danzik17:  ok so its just an aliases, so bind in the latest release .bind() will also deal with elements added to the page by ajax after the initial .bind()  and .live() is not needed?
[06:35:45] <danzik17> dorgan: no, i didn't say that, i said bind just calls .on .  if you want event delegation, use either ?delegate or .on
[06:37:06] <dorgan> danzik17: my understanding is that .on() replaces .bind(), .delegate() & .live()   is my understanding not correct?
[06:37:21] <Joejtye50> hey I have an object, like {"1325894400000":641,"1325980800000":641,"1326067200000":645,"1326153600000":645}
[06:37:30] <Joejtye50> now I want to get the very last of those
[06:37:37] <danzik17> dorgan: that's correct, .on can function as any one of those three
[06:37:53] <Joejtye50> but how can I get the last one, in this case ["1326153600000"]
[06:38:05] <quantegy> get it's length -1
[06:38:23] <quantegy> use that number to acquire the last index
[06:38:37] <dorgan> danzik17:  so calling .bind() in the current release will not work for elements that are added to the page after the initial .bind() call but using .on() will?
[06:39:02] <Joejtye50> the length is undefined
[06:39:11] <Joejtye50> because it isn't a numbered array
[06:39:47] <danzik17> dorgan: pretty much.  i don't want to get into detail, but you can do manual event delegation with .bind as well, but that's something you can google perhaps - otherwise, stick to .on or .delegate
[06:40:16] <quantegy> use jquery's makeArray method
[06:40:37] <Joejtye50> `help makeArray
[06:40:45] <Joejtye50> um
[06:41:03] <dorgan> ok I am just cleaning up some code with one of our frameworks here at work, and we've brought jquery 1.7.2 into our framework and namespaced it internally, and I had seen some calls to .bind()  so I was wondering if I should clean them up and change them to .on()   and it sounds like I should

[06:41:33] <quantegy> joe, have a look at this
[06:42:48] <danzik17> dorgan: it's not needed if you don't want to.  this should illustrate the point:  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L954-956
[06:44:00] <quantegy> this looks good too, but not a jquery solution:

[06:44:30] <Joejtye50> quantegy: that doesn't apply to my situation
[06:44:45] <quantegy> what doesn
[06:44:51] <quantegy> what doesn't?
[06:44:58] <dorgan> danzik17: ahhh so passing the second argument makes it work on elements that are added to the page after the initial call
[06:45:01] <Joejtye50> you are working with {0:1,1:2,2:3,3:5,4:7,5:11}
[06:45:03] <Joejtye50> in http://jsfiddle.net/Jn5z6/
[06:45:12] <Joejtye50> I am working with a named object
[06:45:22] <Joejtye50> which you can't use obj.length on
[06:45:38] <quantegy> you need to convert the obj to an ary
[06:45:44] <Joejtye50> because {'foo':'bar'}.length returns undefined
[06:45:45] <quantegy> arrays can provide length
[06:45:57] <Joejtye50> how to convert the named object to an array
[06:46:05] <quantegy> see my links ^
[06:46:09] <danzik17> dorgan: not quite, it has to do with event bubbling which you can google to read about, .live and .delegate make it more straightforward to do event delegation, but it can be done with bind as well ( sounds like you have some reading to do )
[06:46:49] <danzik17> Joejtye50: if you're always going to be accessing it array style, why not make it an array rather than an object in the first place?

[06:48:43] <Joejtye50> the toObject just keeps it an object, which isn't surprising
[06:49:30] <dorgan> danzik17:  yes that part i understand, as the initial selector  is where the event will be placed, so if you do $('#myDiv').on('click','.clickable',function(){...});  that will basically add the click event to any elements of class of clickable that get added to #myDiv after the initial bind where as   $(document).on('click','.clickable',function(){...});  will be put at the document level and any elements of class clickable that get added to the
[06:49:38] <Joejtye50> hariom: you should check JQuery UI
[06:49:47] <Joejtye50> there is a search suggest thing
[06:50:31] <EdwardIII> yep, autosuggest
[06:50:37] <Joejtye50> hariom: http://jqueryui.com/download the "autocomplete" widget
[06:50:44] <EdwardIII> tried it out, seems to work pretty well here
[06:50:58] <danzik17> dorgan: you're close, it's just a slight conceptual difference - the handler is not added to new objects, it remains on #myDiv or document.  events bubble from child elements, and if they match the provided selector, the handler is called.
[06:51:48] <dorgan> correct
[06:52:22] <dorgan> danzik17: yes ok perfect thank you
[06:53:49] <Joejtye50> quantegy: those links you gave don't work for something like {"1325894400000":641,"1325980800000":641,"1326067200000":645,"1326153600000":645}

[06:58:01] <Joejtye50> I want to get the last of those values, in this case ["1326153600000"], but I don't know how I can get that value
[07:02:19] <quantegy> joe: sry man, try searching around some more, i've gotten objects like that to convert to arrays before, I don't know why you're having a difficult time with it
[07:02:31] <quantegy> search around, you'll find something
[07:02:53] <dorgan> Joejtye50: you need to convert it to an array
[07:03:05] <dorgan> you really cant get the last item without it being an array

[08:19:43] <tintin> soahccc: But if i use .html or .replaceWith, then would other users can see that comment? will the comment be available for them?

[08:20:29] <soahccc> tintin: Ehhh they should see it or what are you trying to do?
[08:20:42] <ezio> fuchstronaut_, are you trying to unselect text to mitigate an issue where double clicking is selecting text?
[08:20:45] <tintin> ezio: Ok, .text can be another option , but again, then would other users can see that mment? will the comment be available for them?
[08:21:10] <tintin> soahccc: Are you sure? How are you sure?
[08:21:12] <ezio> tintin, that should be at a db level
[08:21:25] <ezio> tintin, otherwise that info that they shouldn't see is still in the document

[08:21:41] <tintin> I meant, will that comment be available untile the page reloading?

[08:23:12] <fuchstronaut_> ah nvm
[08:23:32] <tintin> Ok, you can insert the comment, but will that be available until they reload that page?
[08:23:50] <ezio> fuchstronaut_, sounds like what you're doing can be done completely with css
[08:24:15] <ezio> available until they reload the page?
[08:24:23] <ezio> you don't want it available after a page reload?
[08:24:27] <soahccc> tintin: depends on the time they wait. If the reload it will be rendered directly or not?
[08:24:51] <Krambiorix> can anyone help? http://pastebin.com/hVEAWC6f
[08:25:15] <tintin> I think, .html or .text or .replaceWith won't reload the page or the whole comment div
[08:25:41] <ezio> tintin, i think you're asking about how ajax works
[08:25:50] <ezio> but yes .. that is correct
[08:26:05] <tintin> ezio: correct? What is correct?
[08:26:22] <ezio> tintin, what you should do is

[08:27:03] <utochkaPogibeli> hi
[08:27:07] <tintin> soahccc: Without page reloading, Yes. like news.google.com or facebook.com
[08:27:21] <utochkaPogibeli> are there any 'unprecise' jquery versions?
[08:27:34] <tintin> jquery-1.7
[08:27:52] <utochkaPogibeli> by unprecise i mean that it isn't predictable of what it will do
[08:28:22] <utochkaPogibeli> i.e. i will do $('div.someclass').addClass('some another class') and it may succeed, and may not suceed
[08:28:25] <soahccc> tintin: either use pulling (higher load) or pushing (much more complex)
[08:28:44] <utochkaPogibeli> or i can do multiple actions simultaneously
[08:28:45] <tintin> soahccc: Please explain
[08:29:11] <utochkaPogibeli> i.e. $('div.someclass').remove() and $('div.someclass').removeClass('someclass');
[08:29:25] <soahccc> tintin: please google (data polling / data pushing)
[08:29:31] <ezio> $.getJson('save_comment', {comment: comment, id: id}, function(data){if(!data.success) /*bad shit*/ return; $('#comment_area'').append(#('<div class="comment"/>').text(data.comment) ...
[08:29:43] <tintin> soahccc: data pulling or polling ?
[08:29:51] <soahccc> polling is right ;)
[08:30:44] <tintin> ezio: I understand what you said, but did you check if that comment available to others too after your appending or is it just on your browser?
[08:31:17] <ezio> tintin, other people will definitely see that in their browser the next time they visit that page
[08:31:23] <ezio> if you want them to automagically see that
[08:31:50] <ezio> you have to set a timer (setTimeout(function(){checkforcommentupdates()}, 1000);
[08:31:51] <tintin> ezio: Define next time
[08:32:03] <ezio> next time they refresh the page
[08:32:12] <tintin> ezio: There you go
[08:32:15] <ezio> but if you want it to pop the comment in
[08:32:22] <ezio> while everyone else is watching the page
[08:32:38] <tintin> ezio: That's what i asked, think that they won't refresh/reload that page, so is that availabe instantly?
[08:32:50] <ezio> tintin, if you do this
[08:33:10] <tintin> ezio: What is checkforcommentupdates here?
[08:33:22] <ezio> setTimeout(function(){checkforcommentupdates(); setTimeout(function(){checkforcommentupdates()};}, 1000
[08:33:36] <ezio> checkforcomments can be done one of two ways
[08:33:39] <GreekFreak> hi all
[08:34:06] <tintin> ezio: So you this would reload the page after some period?
[08:34:30] <ezio> tintin, the way i'm about to tell you will update the comments as the user sits on the page
[08:34:35] <ezio> without reloading
[08:34:51] <ezio> first way:
[08:35:14] <ezio> tintin, the way i'm about to tell you will update the comments as the user sits on the page
[08:35:16] <ezio> first way:
[08:35:42] <GreekFreak> I'd like to remove a validation tip on focusout of an element, but not when I click a specific button. For some reason this does not work:  card_title_input.focusout(function() {  if (card_title_save_btn.is(":focus")) {  console.log(focused);  }});
[08:35:48] <tintin> ezio: update = reload ?
[08:35:57] <ezio> NO!
[08:36:01] <ezio> while they're on the page
[08:36:04] <ezio> staring at the div
[08:36:07] <ezio> without pressing f5
[08:36:29] <ezio> $.getJson('getallcomments', function(data){if(!data.success)return;$('#comments_area').clear();$.each(data.comments,function(){addcomment(this.comment)
[08:36:37] <d3f4ultr0> hey folks, I have little Javascript knowledge. Which training should I attend? Cost is not an issue
[08:36:49] <ezio> that sends a request to the server saying get all the comments
[08:36:52] <ezio> when you return
[08:37:00] <timoxley> d3f4ultr0 I'll teach you.
[08:37:02] <ezio> put all that info into the comment bodx
[08:37:14] <ezio> user doesn't have to reload
[08:37:19] <ezio> it's just instantly there
[08:37:23] <tintin> setTimeout(function(){checkforcommentupdates();  setTimeout(function(){checkforcommentupdates()};}, 1000
[08:37:24] <ezio> it takes one second though
[08:37:27] <d3f4ultr0> timoxley: :)
[08:37:33] <ezio> tintin, yes
[08:37:41] <ezio> that's the thing that keeps asking the server
[08:37:55] <tintin> ezio: That means you are reloading the whole comment div, right? not the whole page pressing F5
[08:37:59] <ezio> right
[08:38:01] <ezio> but
[08:38:04] <ezio> my code has a flaw
[08:38:13] <ezio> can you see what it is?
[08:38:15] <timoxley> d3f4ultr0 no joke add me on skype: secoif
[08:38:30] <tintin> ezio: Which code?
[08:38:39] <ezio> the one you just repasted
[08:38:55] <d3f4ultr0> timoxley: what's my guarantee
[08:39:33] <ezio> the problem with that code is that every second it's going to ask the server for new information
[08:39:39] <ezio>  but a request might take longer than a second
[08:39:54] <timoxley> d3f4ultr0 I guarantee you will know javascript better, soon.
[08:40:06] <tintin> ezio: every second is not good idea, 30 or 60 seconds is good
[08:40:08] <timoxley> :)
[08:40:10] <ezio> setTimeout(function(){checkforcommentupdates();  /*this part right here ---->>>>*/ setTimeout(function(){checkforcommentupdates()};}, 1000
[08:40:16] <ezio> tintin, no need
[08:40:27] <d3f4ultr0> skype is also blocked here from work
[08:40:32] <ezio> you just need to get that second settimeout into the $.getJson request
[08:41:13] <timoxley> ezio
[08:41:18] <timoxley> setInterval
[08:41:21] <ezio> $.getJson('checkforcomments', function(){.... /*the request has definitely completed now so let's dispatch another one in one second */ setTimeout(function(){checkforcommentupdates()};
[08:41:32] <ezio> timoxley, no
[08:41:41] <fuchstronaut_> cann I fadeIn TABLE rows after adding them to the dom somehow?
[08:41:49] <fuchstronaut_> fadeIn('slow') just shows it for me
[08:41:55] <ezio> timoxley, the point is you don't want it to execute every second
[08:42:02] <ezio> just one second after the request finishes
[08:42:23] <timoxley> ezio what's wrong with your code then?
[08:42:45] <ezio> the second settimeout is not in the request completion code
[08:42:51] <ezio> therefore
[08:43:02] <ezio> wait 1 second request 1 -->>>
[08:43:12] <ezio> wait 1 second request 2 ->>>>
[08:43:18] <ezio> request 2 completes
[08:43:20] <r1pp3rj4ck> hey guys
[08:43:22] <ezio> request 1 completes
[08:43:43] <d3f4ultr0> timoxley: how are you going to teach me?
[08:43:49] <fuchstronaut_> fadeIn('slow') just shows it for me
[08:43:54] <fuchstronaut_> cann I fadeIn TABLE rows after adding them to the dom somehow?
[08:44:02] <fuchstronaut_> wops
[08:44:05] <r1pp3rj4ck> i'm absolutely not a front end dev but deadline's coming and i need to take care about some extra stuff since i've finished the back end
[08:44:15] <timoxley> ezio can you show a full example
[08:44:26] <timoxley> d3f4ultr0 pm me
[08:44:27] <r1pp3rj4ck> so i need to figure how to trigger a function when someone clicks on a select option
[08:44:34] <r1pp3rj4ck> also when it's the already selected one
[08:44:43] <r1pp3rj4ck> so .change() isn't good
[08:45:01] <tintin> ezio: Hi
[08:45:08] <r1pp3rj4ck> could someone help me pls?
[08:45:21] <johnathanb> I have a jquery post that posts to a page, the page will return json if it's successful or html to repopulate the page if it's not. Checking to typeof == object works fine in Chrome and Safari but not in Firefox
[08:45:25] <ezio> tintin, sup buds
[08:45:27] <johnathanb> Is there anything special I need to do?
[08:45:42] <johnathanb> content type header is being set to application/json if json is being returned
[08:45:54] <rmill> r1pp3rj4ck, you can use trigger to call the change immediately.
[08:46:04] <tintin> ezio: Something like this? https://gist.github.com/3054454
[08:46:13] <GreekFreak> how do I know which element is currently being clicked?
[08:46:19] <ezio> timoxley, no need.  just imagine the scenario in your brain.  polling should never be done with setinterval .. think about why that might be.
[08:46:28] <r1pp3rj4ck> rmill, what do you mean/how?
[08:46:34] <ezio> tintin, very good
[08:46:49] <tintin> ezio: There you go
[08:46:56] <r1pp3rj4ck> i tried to use .click() on options
[08:47:07] <r1pp3rj4ck> but it doesn't seem working either (nothing happens, at least at chromium)
[08:47:19] <tintin> ezio: If you ultimately reload the whole content div, then i think , .load('updatecommentdiv.php') is for that purpose
[08:47:20] <ezio> tintin, oh i see
[08:47:27] <ezio> can i edit that?
[08:47:29] <timoxley> ezio isn't what tintin wrote exactly what you had?
[08:47:36] <tintin> ezio: Yes, you can
[08:47:38] <rmill> r1pp3rj4ck: $( 'button' ).click( function(e) {} ).trigger();
[08:47:52] <ezio> how?
[08:47:57] <tintin> timoxley: Yes, i pasted his code
[08:48:01] <timoxley> fork
[08:48:09] <timoxley> ezio if you use setInterval, just check if you've got a current request pending.
[08:48:10] <tintin> ezio: Are you familier with .load function?
[08:48:11] <r1pp3rj4ck> rmill, i don't have a button
[08:48:30] <r1pp3rj4ck> and i guess you've misunderstood me
[08:48:51] <rmill> r1pp3rj4ck: the same logic applies
[08:49:00] <r1pp3rj4ck> i have <select class="foo"><option class="bar" /><option class="bar" /></select>
[08:49:06] <rmill> ...
[08:49:08] <ezio> tintin, sure if you want to do your html serverside
[08:49:43] <r1pp3rj4ck> rmill, .click() doesn't work on options...
[08:49:54] <rmill> r1pp3rj4ck: I KNOW
[08:49:55] <ezio> tintin, my personal preference is to return ajax and have a function that adds a single comment to the div, then iterate over the json array and call that function over and over
[08:49:59] <rmill> but the .trigger part does.
[08:50:08] <ezio> tintin, to use this
[08:50:18] <tintin> ezio: I asked because if you need to do this after appending, checkforcommentupdates , then why not just using the .load()
[08:50:43] <ezio> tintin, you need a named function to recall your own function
[08:51:10] <r1pp3rj4ck> rmill, so on what event should i call trigger and to trigger what?
[08:51:15] <timoxley> GreekFreak 'this' in your click handler should be the button
[08:51:20] <rmill> r1pp3rj4ck: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/Fsrg9/
[08:51:22] <ezio> checkforcommentupdates($.load ... setTimeout...
[08:51:39] <ezio> err
[08:51:45] <rmill> r1pp3rj4ck: notice how it calls change on change _and_ immediately?
[08:52:03] <javalover> ya know what I hate
[08:52:15] <javalover> people who can't code who try to tell you what is possible with the programs you're coding.
[08:52:32] <javalover> and tell you "only 'certain people' are capable of being facebook, you can't just code something & become popular"
[08:52:34] <r1pp3rj4ck> rmill, it triggers change when select is changed, doesn't it?
[08:52:36] <GreekFreak> timoxley, I'm not in the click handler. basically I have a focusout in a text element, with a save next to it. on focusout I want to undo, but *not* if you click the button
[08:52:40] <ezio> tintin, checkforcommentupdates($.load('checkforcomments' function(responseText) {... setTimeout(function(){checkforcommentupdates}, 1000)
[08:53:06] <rmill> r1pp3rj4ck: maybe I'm not understanding what you're after...
[08:53:16] <tintin> ezio: Please gist.github.com the complete code, it's getting confusing
[08:53:17] <javalover> as if to say nothing I ever code will ever be successful no matter how amazing I make it!!
[08:53:28] <Ricaz> I have a problem with font sizes across OSs. In my win7, the font looks fine, but in linux with Gnome, the font height has more than doubled. Any ideas?
[08:53:48] <timoxley> javalover chances are they are right
[08:53:48] <javalover> like even if I make a site that makes the modern day google look like a joke, nobody will use it. sooo annoying to hear these people talk.
[08:53:53] <Ricaz> ^however, in linux the text has been anti-aliased I think
[08:54:19] <javalover> tim how can they be right?
[08:54:26] <javalover> that would mean everyone should just give up on coding
[08:54:46] <javalover> what's the point of coding new stuff, if everyone won't care.
[08:55:00] <r1pp3rj4ck> rmill, i can understand... i threw a WtfException to when the customers filed this "bug report"
[08:55:05] <javalover> but you don't see multimillion dollar companies going "ya know what we should just give up, cuz facebook exist"
[08:55:16] <javalover> no they're like "fucking inivate we can climb the alexa ladder"
[08:55:20] <timoxley> GreekFreak I have a feeling when you click on the save button you lose focus on the text input before the button is even clicked
[08:55:38] <r1pp3rj4ck> so i need something like .change(), but not only when the user changes the value of the select but when they click on the very same (already selected) option too
[08:55:42] <ezio> tintin, http://jsfiddle.net/bTxjS/
[08:55:53] <timoxley> javalover too many people talking themselves up is the problem.
[08:56:02] <javalover> what are you talking about?
[08:56:06] <javalover> talking themselves up?
[08:56:29] <tintin> ezio: Also for this, $('#comment_area'').append(#('<div class="comment"/>').text(data.comment) , is that data taken from server, or can't you take the data from the textbox of comment like data=(#id_comment_to_post).val() or something
[08:56:30] <timoxley> making themselves look good
[08:56:45] <javalover> I mean it's all code in the end
[08:56:53] <javalover> it really has nothing to do with ur car or house
[08:57:02] <javalover> the truth is if people like something they will use it
[08:57:31] <ezio> tintin, you would never want to.  you need to send the comment to the server, sanitize it, save it, then it's available to all.  the polling method should automatically update the users own comment
[08:57:36] <GreekFreak> timoxley, exactly. I've read about adding a timeout, but not sure how to do that either, without doing setTimeout(button.click, 1000) and thus clikcing the button twice
[08:57:40] <whitenoise> since $(this) returns the element inside of an array, if I want to check the attr('disabled') of that element, how do I accomplish that?
[08:57:40] <javalover> so I really hate when people are like "nobody will ever use your code"
[08:57:50] <whitenoise> $(this)[0].attr('disabled') says that HTMLElement has no method 'attr'
[08:57:56] <whitenoise> but that's the only way I can think of to do it
[08:57:59] <rmill> r1pp3rj4ck: http://jsfiddle.net/78x9Q/4/
[08:58:07] <javalover> and i'm like "this code is just like google....why wouldn't they use this?"
[08:58:14] <rmill> r1pp3rj4ck: you can bind click to a parent element
[08:58:15] <timoxley> javalover who cares what that say? just prove them wrong
[08:58:20] <rmill> r1pp3rj4ck: and use that
[08:58:24] <javalover> well duh
[08:58:35] <gmurphey> whitenoise $(this).eq(0).attr('disabled')
[08:58:40] <GreekFreak> timoxley, my other solution woulb be to have a variable and set it to false when I hover above the button, and true when I leave it, thus allowing me to perform the focus out action only on true :/
[08:58:43] <javalover> i'm just saying what's wrong with the world why can't they just say "oh cool nice awesome good luck with that"
[08:59:01] <javalover> why they gotta be all "it'll never work" wtf is up with that?
[08:59:09] <rmill> r1pp3rj4ck: also, that's a horrible example, but hopefully you get the idea... I just found that on the googles.
[08:59:10] <whitenoise> gmurphey, aha, thanks
[08:59:16] <javalover> you don't see people going "I wanna play baseball this year" and someone going "you'll never make the team!"
[08:59:22] <NoiseEee> also, whats the deal with airplane peanuts?!
[08:59:28] <tintin> ezio: Is this the complete code then? https://gist.github.com/3054527
[08:59:49] <rmill> global var 'numclicks' - do _not_ want.
[08:59:51] <r1pp3rj4ck> rmill, it's still not really doing what i need :S
[08:59:57] <timoxley> GreekFreak you could simply set a timer on the focus out, if the focus out is occurring because of someone clicking the button, you could simply wait a few ms to see if that's the case, otherwise, clear the input
[09:00:00] <rmill> isn't it?
[09:00:05] <gmurphey> whitenoise: [0] makes it just a plain DOM object rather than jQuery
[09:00:07] <r1pp3rj4ck> if i click on the selected one, it doesn't shows the alert
[09:00:08] <javalover> or something like "imma take AP chemistry this year" and someone going "you'll never pass that class ur too stupid"
[09:00:13] <r1pp3rj4ck> only when i click on the select next time
[09:00:26] <r1pp3rj4ck> hmmm sometimes it does
[09:00:30] <rmill> :/
[09:00:37] <rmill> it should do it all the times.
[09:00:42] <r1pp3rj4ck> i guess it losts count somewhere :D
[09:00:54] <rmill> ya - that part is kinda weak
[09:01:01] <rmill> also, you'll need to use change() as well
[09:01:14] <tintin> ezio: Does that matter if you append the div with comment-text taking the text from (#id_comment_to_post).val() or from function(data) { .//from server. } , because you are loading the whole comment div finally, otherwise it's not available to other users instantly,
[09:01:14] <ezio> tintin, that's it so far .. there's one last thing you need to consider
[09:01:16] <rmill> because doing it this way - you lose keyboard access
[09:01:30] <rmill> r1pp3rj4ck: gimme a sec and I'll do up a proper demo
[09:01:36] <GreekFreak> timoxley, ah!. I'll try it now
[09:01:38] <ezio> tintin, and that is exactly it
[09:01:38] <r1pp3rj4ck> rmill, thanks
[09:01:49] <r1pp3rj4ck> brb
[09:02:00] <ezio> ezio, your request to the server should also include the last comment id that you received
[09:02:14] <ezio> ezio, this way the server only returns comments since that id
[09:02:18] <whitenoise> gmurphey, hm. this is still not working, it returns undefined, even though the object has a 'disabled' attribute on it.
[09:02:25] <ezio> gah
[09:02:30] <ezio> tintin, those comments were for you
[09:02:45] <tintin> i understand
[09:02:55] <ezio> and therefore you shouldn't use load
[09:03:05] <ezio> you should use $.getJson
[09:03:15] <ezio> but i think you have all the pieces now
[09:03:19] <ezio> so imma peace out
[09:03:25] <GreekFreak> timoxley, wait, so I simply do this? setTimeout(element.focusout(function()), 1000) ?
[09:03:46] <timoxley> GreekFreak looks like wrong way round
[09:03:53] <fuchstronaut_> how to unbind ALL handlers from an object?
[09:04:03] <whitenoise> gmurphey, http://pastie.org/4205029
[09:04:04] <timoxley> GreekFreak focusout event should trigger set timeout
[09:04:10] <whitenoise> gmurphey, thats what I get in google dev console
[09:04:12] <Ricaz> My site looks completely horrible in IE8 and below. Anything I might have forgotten?
[09:04:34] <tintin> ezio: So think that you are using the appending method
[09:04:51] <ezio> you should use the append method outside of the text method
[09:05:06] <whitenoise> gmurphey, eq(0) still returns an array object
[09:05:14] <GreekFreak> timoxley, yes, but what do I put in the function part of the setTimeout(function, 1000) ?
[09:05:38] <ezio> $('#comments_area').append($('<div class="comment"/>').text(data.text));
[09:05:42] <tintin> ezio: You append the div taking the data from function(data){ //data from server } or append the div taking the data from textbox like , ('#id_div_to_post').val(),
[09:05:47] <GreekFreak> timoxley, OH! the clearing. sorry, bit slow today :P
[09:05:49] <rmill> r1pp3rj4ck: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/Fsrg9/1/
[09:05:57] <rmill> r1pp3rj4ck: now it fires like _crazy_
[09:06:01] <tintin> ezio: function(data){ this data from server, right?
[09:06:12] <tintin> ezio: function(data){ this data comes from server, right?
[09:06:13] <d3f4ultr0> timoxley: sorry, someone was here at my desk
[09:06:27] <rmill> r1pp3rj4ck: no way you'll ever miss it now.
[09:06:28] <timoxley> fuchstronaut_ tried just off()
[09:06:41] <ezio> tintin, yes ... $.getJson('checkforcommentupdates', {last_id: last_id}, function(data)
[09:06:46] <ezio> data is what is returned from the server
[09:06:53] <tintin> Ok
[09:06:54] <fuchstronaut_> but do i have to specifiy which one i want to remove, or can i remove them all?
[09:06:59] <r1pp3rj4ck> rmill, thanks :)
[09:07:27] <rmill> r1pp3rj4ck: hopefully that example makes sense
[09:07:41] <tintin> ezio: if you take the data from textbox like , ('#id_div_to_post').val(), then append the new div, does that matter at all ?
[09:07:45] <rmill> you'll notice mutiple calls, because it's binded to .click _and_ .change
[09:08:04] <ezio> tintin, yes ... what if the server rejects it ... or the server didn't respond.
[09:08:20] <tintin> ezio: Yes, that's a point
[09:08:24] <ezio> tintin, always always always take the data you got from the server and not the user
[09:08:34] <tintin> ezio: Ok, but think that data is saved successfully everytime
[09:08:36] <ezio> the user can fuck with js
[09:08:37] <ezio> locally
[09:08:45] <ezio> they can't fuck with the server
[09:08:50] <ezio> without having my job
[09:08:54] <tintin> lolol
[09:08:59] <ezio> i'm a pen tester
[09:09:11] <tintin> What is pen tester?
[09:09:11] <socialhapy>  Tweet from jquery: Check out the latest changes to Sizzle that are landing in jQuery 1.8! http://t.co/LNuWVjDt  http://bit.ly/LRnBx8
[09:09:19] <ezio> tintin, a hacker who gets paid
[09:09:36] <ezio> tintin, never assume that
[09:09:41] <tintin> ezio: But think that data is saved successfully everytime ,  then does that matter taking value from textbox?
[09:09:50] <ezio> tintin, you immediately lose data integrity when you assume that
[09:10:01] <ezio> you could have a bug
[09:10:05] <tintin> ezio: Which programming language do you use to hack? What do you hack usually?
[09:10:07] <ezio> imagine somewhere you didn't escape your data
[09:10:19] <ezio> tintin, we program our scanners and trojans in c++
[09:10:22] <tintin> ezio: What do you mean by data integrity?
[09:10:30] <tintin> horrible
[09:10:33] <ezio> tintin, but we have a complicated web front end
[09:11:01] <ezio> tintin, i mean that something could fail and the user thins everything is okay
[09:11:07] <tintin> ezio: c++ used in website? I knew usually php/python used for website or asp.net
[09:11:10] <ezio> tintin, i mean incorrect data ..
[09:11:21] <tintin> ezio: Ok, i understood
[09:11:27] <ezio> tintin, no the web front end is done in c# but we wrote the http server in c++
[09:11:55] <tintin> ezio: Why did you write http server in c++? there is apache
[09:12:10] <tintin> ezio: asp.net uses IIS i think
[09:12:22] <tintin> windows http server = IIS
[09:12:39] <ezio> it was either write an plugin for apache and make everyone install apache .. but it literally took as long as it takes to write a robust front controller
[09:12:43] <ezio> to do it this way
[09:12:53] <ezio> and the http server travels with our installer package
[09:12:59] <whitenoise> an extremely minimal web server is fast.
[09:13:06] <ezio> and is only 200k
[09:13:25] <tintin> whitenoise: And mention that minimal web server's name
[09:13:37] <whitenoise> tintin, not apache.
[09:13:44] <tintin> lol
[09:13:55] <whitenoise> nginx, thin, something like that.
[09:13:57] <whitenoise> lighttpd
[09:14:04] <whitenoise> ezio, i'm a penetration tester as well :)
[09:14:20] <whitenoise> i just got done going from null byte injection to root on web server a couple days ago
[09:14:21] <whitenoise> was a fun trip
[09:14:26] <tintin> ezio: So how can you hack with js or how can i/others hack with js, javascript files resides on servers webroo/js/ directory or something like that
[09:14:35] <whitenoise> tintin, xss
[09:14:50] <tintin> whitenoise: xss, what is that? web server?
[09:14:57] * whitenoise facepalm
[09:14:58] <whitenoise> google.
[09:15:07] <GreekFreak> timoxley, thank you. did the trick. needed to fiddle with setting the focus first but worked like a charm :)
[09:15:19] <timoxley> :D
[09:15:30] <ryanneufeld> tintin: if you don't know what XSS is, you'd better start reading and not asking in #jquery how to hack
[09:15:33] <tomasm-> hi, is val() on a checkbox smart enough to say the value if it's checked and not if it's not, or do i need is(":checked") for that?
[09:15:40] <d3f4ultr0> has anyone tried Bocoup's training?
[09:15:49] <ryanneufeld> ?val @tomasm-
[09:15:49] <bot-t> tomasm-, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[09:15:59] <tintin> I would go for apache everytimg
[09:16:03] <ezio> tintin, js files get executed by your own server ... i could just write a js file that sends bad requests to your server ... unless you sanitize those requests you're doomed
[09:16:06] <tintin> everytime
[09:16:19] <ezio> tintin, also
[09:16:28] <ryanneufeld> ezio: unless your server is node, it' doesn't execute JS
[09:16:31] <tintin> I didn't try nginx or thin,
[09:16:32] <ryanneufeld> the client side does
[09:16:38] <tintin> I won't go for lighttpd
[09:16:48] <ezio> ryanneufeld, oooooooooops
[09:16:51] <tintin> I can try nginx though in future
[09:16:58] <ezio> tintin, js files get executed by your local computer
[09:17:06] <ezio> freudian slip
[09:17:13] <nFFF> Guys chrome is throwing unexpected token illegal
[09:17:24] <ezio> to save a comment and have it update on the local computer is only going to take a second
[09:17:27] <ezio> they won't even notice
[09:17:39] <ezio> unless there's a problem with the server
[09:17:52] <ezio> but then they're gonna know .. okay .. my comment didn't save ...gonna send it again soon
[09:18:00] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/hBgjM/7/
[09:18:05] <nFFF> scroll to bottom of code
[09:18:11] <nFFF> its throwing the error right at bottom
[09:18:18] <tintin> I usually don't try other webserver because, reading documentations to configure or to be master on that server can be painful/tedious or time consuming task
[09:18:40] <ryanneufeld> nFFF: it's not throwing any errors for me? DId you click update?
[09:18:41] <tintin> rather i should concentrate on builting website, rather than webserver
[09:19:15] <tintin> ezio: How can you send request to the server for my website?
[09:19:17] <nFFF> ryanneufeld, its fine in fiddle
[09:19:19] <ezio> tintin, it's a very well understood convention to protect data integrity in this way
[09:19:21] <nFFF> on my local codez
[09:19:21] <tintin> ezio: using js
[09:19:43] <ezio> tintin, i don't even really need js ... i could just write an httpclient to do whatever i need
[09:19:49] <whitenoise> tintin, it really sounds like you need to read about how web servers work, and how client-side vs server-side scripting is called, etc.
[09:19:58] <tintin> ezio: Then why would i or why would people use js if someone can send bad spam request to server for my website?
[09:20:07] <whitenoise> you can also just send raw requests through telnet
[09:20:16] <ezio> because your server should sanitize that
[09:20:17] <tintin> This? http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html
[09:20:21] <ezio> you provide js for all the good people
[09:20:28] <ezio> but even then
[09:20:35] <ezio> you're your own worst enemy
[09:20:43] <ezio> what if you code someting improperly in the js
[09:20:46] <ezio> either way
[09:20:48] <ryanneufeld> tintin: js has nothing to do with sending spam to your server
[09:20:52] <whitenoise> lol
[09:20:54] <ezio> it's very well understood that you should do it this way
[09:20:55] <tintin> ezio: I'm talking about sending request using js, i know you can write something using php or c# or other language to send request to my website
[09:21:09] <ryanneufeld> tintin: doesn't change anything
[09:21:20] <whitenoise> is it possible to move this conversation somewhere else, since it has nothing to do with jquery.
[09:21:22] <whitenoise> :P
[09:21:34] <tintin> it's with jquery
[09:21:40] <ryanneufeld> no, it's not
[09:21:41] <ezio> tintin, i could just change the code in firebug
[09:21:46] <tintin> jquery ajax
[09:21:54] <tintin> ezio: lol,
[09:22:01] <ryanneufeld> no, you're confusing it with basic web principles
[09:22:07] <ezio> tintin, as easy as that ... i could just add a tag in the html to load my own javascripts
[09:22:17] <ezio> greasemonkey
[09:22:22] <ezio> several ways buds
[09:22:27] <ezio> you better get with the program
[09:22:32] <ezio> i'm off to lunch folks
[09:22:33] <tintin> ezio: Ok, you can change the jquery code from firebug, but will that affect/save/ data to my website?
[09:22:39] <ezio> no
[09:22:44] <ezio> well
[09:22:45] <ezio> yes
[09:22:46] <ezio> wait
[09:22:46] <ezio> yes
[09:22:47] <ryanneufeld> tintin: the language is irrelevant, The method is irrelevant, if I want to send bad data to your server, and you don't validate it server side
[09:22:55] <ryanneufeld> then yes, it can effect your data
[09:23:17] <ezio> tintin, i thought you were asking if it would save those
[09:23:22] <tintin> I do form submit validation everytime with php
[09:23:28] <ezio> tintin, what if rewrote your getjson to
[09:23:39] <ryanneufeld> Good job tintin
[09:23:48] <tintin> ezio: Well, that's good point
[09:24:03] <ezio> tintin, $.getJson('checkforcommentupdates' {id:"' drop all tables;"
[09:24:07] <tintin> ezio: Then how to protect against that .getJSON or .ajax method
[09:24:18] <ezio> tintin, server side sanitation
[09:24:19] <ryanneufeld> tintin: server side validation
[09:24:20] <ezio> always
[09:24:22] <ryanneufeld> LOL
[09:24:45] <ezio> anyways folks ... LUCH
[09:24:50] <ryanneufeld> later ezio
[09:24:51] <ezio> i'm so hungry i ate the n
[09:24:54] <tintin> ezio: So you have to check always what .ajax or .getJson sends?
[09:25:04] <ezio> ALWAYS
[09:25:06] <ezio> EVERY REQUEST
[09:25:10] <tintin> ezio: Ok, go for lunch and come back again, i'm waiting for you
[09:25:21] <ryanneufeld> tintin: it matters not what method the data was sent
[09:25:39] <ryanneufeld> tintin: you should *always* 100% of the time validate that data before storing it
[09:26:16] <ryanneufeld> nFFF: If you're fiddle doesn't replicate the problem I'm afraid I can't help. Perhaps you have a typo?
[09:26:24] <tintin> Usually people send request to server using .ajax or .post or .get or .getJson or .load() or something like these
[09:26:52] <d3f4ultr0> hey folks, what does init: mean here, is it only a label or alias? init: function() { }
[09:27:18] <ryanneufeld> tintin: sure, what's your point
[09:27:21] <xmaddness> d3f4ultr0: in jquery context it is a "method"
[09:27:22] <ryanneufeld> d3f4ultr0: more context?
[09:27:23] <gmurphey> whitenoise: i'm kind of stumped. no idea why $(this) doesn't have the .eq method...
[09:27:35] <xmaddness> d3f4ultr0: its the method that runs as soon as the plugin is loaded
[09:27:51] <ryanneufeld> xmaddness: that's an assumption based on the name
[09:27:56] <tintin> ryanneufeld: sending request to server using jquery and how to protect from bad request/spam request that is sent using jquery
[09:28:01] <xmaddness> I'd say its a pretty good assumption
[09:28:08] <d3f4ultr0> thanks xmaddness
[09:28:14] <tintin> And the answer is: "server side sanitation/validation"
[09:28:21] <ryanneufeld> tintin: You've been told 10 different ways that answer
[09:28:23] <whitenoise> gmurphey, it has the method, the method just returns the same thing as $(this)
[09:28:24] <NoiseEee> tintin: the totally irrelevant part is 'jquery'
[09:28:27] <NoiseEee> tintin: good luck
[09:28:53] <ryanneufeld> tintin: the source of the data doesn't matter, your web server will process it the same. and should
[09:29:17] <ryanneufeld> d3f4ultr0: basicially what that's doing there is defining a function named init() for that object
[09:29:35] <ryanneufeld> d3f4ultr0: so if you have var myobj = { init: function() {} };
[09:29:41] <ryanneufeld> d3f4ultr0: you can go myobj.init()
[09:30:15] <xmaddness> tintin: there is no way to completely sanitize anything and everything that comes from your ajax, or an ajax query that I write. You have no control over what is sent to your server side to process. The only thing you can control is what your server recieves, and how it handles it. Therefore all sanitization should at the very least be done on the server side that handles the incoming ajax
[09:30:15] <xmaddness> request
[09:30:37] <d3f4ultr0> thanks ryanneufeld! Is this a basic javascript or jquery?
[09:30:44] <ryanneufeld> d3f4ultr0: JS
[09:31:29] <jehe> is it possible to check if the user has javascript enabled?
[09:31:32] <ryanneufeld> d3f4ultr0: jquery is heavily OOP, so you'll see that pattern a lot. With the name of init though I would glean that it's intended to be an initialization method for that object
[09:31:36] <ryanneufeld> jehe: no
[09:31:44] <tintin> jehe: That's a good question.
[09:31:51] <whitenoise> ryanneufeld, any idea why $(this) and $(this).eq(0) would return the same thing?
[09:32:02] <jehe> ryanneufeld cause I have seen pages that tell me : You either have Javascript turned of or a NoScript blocking content blablabla
[09:32:09] <whitenoise> i'm trying to check an attribute of $(this), and jquery isn't letting me
[09:32:12] <d3f4ultr0> ryanneufeld: am I doing the right thing that I will attend javascript training first?
[09:32:14] <ryanneufeld> xmaddness: you have no control over the data coming in. Only what you do with it.
[09:32:25] <ryanneufeld> jehe: okay, that's a <noscript> tag
[09:32:28] <xmaddness> ryanneufeld: thats exactly what I said
[09:32:43] <ryanneufeld> xmaddness: "The only thing you can control is what your server recieves, "
[09:32:46] <ryanneufeld> No, you don't :p
[09:32:55] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: ?demo
[09:32:55] <xmaddness> erm well, okay you got me
[09:32:56] <jehe> Do noscript work in modern browsers?
[09:33:03] <ryanneufeld> jehe: yes
[09:33:09] <whitenoise> ryanneufeld, even though that didn't work, I know what you mean.
[09:33:11] <xmaddness> That was intended to mean you can only control how your server deals with what it recieves
[09:33:48] <ryanneufeld> xmaddness: yeah, I figured, but since tintin doesn't seem to understand I'm trying to make sure he's getting the same message from everyone
[09:33:55] <xmaddness> true
[09:33:57] <xmaddness> good catch
[09:34:23] <ryanneufeld> xmaddness: feel free to call me out as well when I make mistakes (not if, but when, it will happen)
[09:34:31] <xmaddness> always does lol
[09:34:37] <whitenoise> i never make mistakes, actually.
[09:34:42] <whitenoise> that's why i'm currently debugging.
[09:34:48] <tintin> lol
[09:34:54] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: LIAR!
[09:34:55] <xmaddness> funny, i'm debugging everyone elses code currently
[09:34:59] <xmaddness> >_<
[09:35:28] <whitenoise> xmaddness, yesterday, this was in ruby, but, a guy submitted bunch of code that broke the entirety of the main page's functionality.
[09:35:32] <whitenoise> and i got stuck with the ticket to fix it.
[09:35:36] <whitenoise> and i was like -.-
[09:35:54] <xmaddness> well, I'm on the SIT team responsible for integrating about 150+ devs work
[09:35:58] <whitenoise> aha
[09:36:00] <xmaddness> not so much fun lol
[09:36:02] <whitenoise> well, we only have8 devs?
[09:36:14] <whitenoise> and i'm not just a dev, i'm system and security administrator as well.
[09:36:22] <xmaddness> I'm just a lowly dev
[09:36:24] <whitenoise> I code when either we're behind on a project or there's nothing for me to do Sys Admin-wise
[09:36:49] <whitenoise> or as I said before, we also sell security packages for our larger customers
[09:36:51] <chrickso> guys, i'm having this issue where an ajax call returns a <a class="myClass">link</a>, but when clicked, my jquery a.myClass isn't picking it up. any idea how to get jquery to see it in the dom? is there a jquery to "refresh the dom" after i push that back
[09:36:52] <whitenoise> and I pen test their sites :)
[09:37:19] <whitenoise> I love my job bunches
[09:37:41] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @whitenoise ?
[09:37:43] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Couldn't find "demo @whitenoise ?" in jQuery Docs.
[09:37:47] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @whitenoise
[09:37:48] <bot-t> whitenoise, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:37:50] <whitenoise> ryanneufeld, hold on, making a pastie
[09:38:08] <ryanneufeld> noooo.... I wants a fiddle...I  wants it my precious
[09:40:49] <xmaddness> chrickso: I believe you are looking for the .live method
[09:41:28] <xmaddness> erm
[09:41:30] <xmaddness> maybe not
[09:43:27] <tintin> whitenoise: "This was in ruby" ? what is that? submitted bunch of code? how?
[09:43:41] <tintin> whitenoise: Which code? ruby or jquery? where?
[09:46:18] <EyePulp> I've heard .live() is getting phased out for .on()
[09:46:52] <whitenoise> ryanneufeld, http://pastie.org/4205260
[09:47:04] <ryanneufeld> EyePulp: you heard right
[09:47:14] <xmaddness> it is
[09:47:15] <ryanneufeld> EyePulp: though live uses on() internally now
[09:47:19] <whitenoise> ryanneufeld, then how is .on() going to start handling elements that aren't there on load?
[09:47:35] <EyePulp> I see.
[09:47:40] <whitenoise> i.e., what live is used for now?
[09:47:40] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: read the docs
[09:47:40] <NoiseEee> whitenoise: thats the whole point of it; you put it on a parent
[09:47:46] <whitenoise> interesting.
[09:47:55] <whitenoise> more importantly: http://pastie.org/4205260
[09:48:04] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: this pastie isn't very useful for debugging
[09:48:16] <ryanneufeld> can you you make a reduced test case in jsfiddle?
[09:48:22] <ryanneufeld> pretty please?
[09:48:36] <tintin> xmaddness: what does that mean by lawly dev?
[09:49:39] <xmaddness> Which brings me back to why I said erm maybe not
[09:49:41] <ryanneufeld> tintin: is english your first language? I feel like there is a barrier
[09:49:42] <xmaddness> use on
[09:49:48] <xmaddness> @ chrickso
[09:50:01] <devoth> chrickso: Mate, you still need help with this?
[09:51:22] <whitenoise> ryanneufeld, how am I supposed to mimic $(this) and such scopes in jsfiddle?
[09:51:36] <chrickso> yes, am here. still searching
[09:51:50] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: it works the same as a site
[09:52:09] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: you put your js in the javascript panel, html in the html pane, and the css in the css pane
[09:52:14] <ryanneufeld> then you choose jquery
[09:52:16] <ryanneufeld> and make it go
[09:52:24] <whitenoise> rawr. i have to write an onclick
[09:52:33] <tintin> xmaddness: lowly dev! , yes
[09:52:40] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: huh?
[09:52:44] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: no you don't
[09:52:53] <tintin> jquery is sometimes confusing to binding event,
[09:53:01] <whitenoise> but thats when my function gets triggered, and where i'm using $(this)
[09:53:10] <tintin> There are multiple way to handle a click event , that's confusing
[09:53:17] <chrickso> devoth:
[09:53:20] <ryanneufeld> ?eq
[09:53:20] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[09:53:30] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: there's your answer
[09:53:38] <chrickso> devoth: here is how i solved it $('body').on("click", 'a.myClass', function() {
[09:53:40] <v_y> when i do $.ajax is returns a deferred. but it also immediately performs the request. is there someway to prevent them from being called before i have gathered all the deferreds i want? otherwise, i don't see how i can pass them all to $.when
[09:53:43] <tintin> Some use .click() , some use bind() some use live() , some use .on(), so which one to use?
[09:53:44] <ryanneufeld> $(this) takes 1 element
[09:53:46] <whitenoise> ah, so it doesn't un-array it
[09:53:51] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: apparently not
[09:53:56] <whitenoise> lamesauce.
[09:54:03] <xmaddness> tintin: .live is depricated for .on
[09:54:04] <devoth> chrickso: you should bind that event with live() function
[09:54:05] <tintin> Why aret there so many options to handle one event?
[09:54:07] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: try .first()
[09:54:18] <ryanneufeld> but if you already have it, why do you care if it's un-array'd
[09:54:19] <whitenoise> but then, if I just use 'this' for the HTML element, its all like "badubu, can't call .attr on that."
[09:54:27] <whitenoise> i can't call .attr() on it
[09:54:28] <tintin> Why do you change function name every now and then
[09:54:31] <tintin> ?
[09:54:33] <devoth> then it constantly searches for event target in DOM
[09:54:34] <ryanneufeld> tintin: because there are many different ways you might want to handle them
[09:54:37] <chrickso> devoth: live is deprecated. apparently on() is the way
[09:54:38] <tintin> today .live() and tomorrow .on()
[09:54:52] <devoth> huh, didn't know that
[09:54:55] <whitenoise> tintin, deprecation is part of language advancement.
[09:55:06] <tintin> Ok, that's good
[09:55:15] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: if you call .attr() on it it assumes the first element in the array
[09:55:16] <whitenoise> sort of like how "Thy" and "thou" are now deprecated words in English
[09:55:20] <whitenoise> we just say "You" and "your"
[09:55:29] <xmaddness> devoth: http://www.ultimatewebtips.com/why-jquery-live-is-a-bad-option-to-use/
[09:55:29] <tintin> But make one way to handle one event, and remove other options to remove ambiguity/confusion
[09:55:30] <whitenoise> ryanneufeld, hm. let me try that.
[09:55:32] <ajpiano> whitenoise: $(this) and $(this).eq(0) are the exact same thing
[09:55:36] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: in fact, all single element operations in jquery work that way
[09:55:37] <drole> you can use the others, they all call on though.
[09:55:42] <ajpiano> whitenoise: are you trying to get an acdtual DOM element instance, instead of a jquery object?
[09:55:44] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: What ajpiano said
[09:55:56] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: no, he wants to call .attr()
[09:56:02] <xmaddness> well, that may be out of date
[09:56:03] <devoth> xmaddness: cheers mate, gonna read it now :)
[09:56:19] <ajpiano> whitenoise: what version of jquery are you using?
[09:56:41] <whitenoise> ajpiano, 1.4
[09:56:46] <ryanneufeld> Whoa
[09:56:49] <ajpiano> bummer
[09:56:49] <xmaddness> wow
[09:56:51] <Zzaichik> nice
[09:56:52] <xmaddness> time to update man
[09:56:56] <whitenoise> ajpiano, and no, i'm trying to get a jquery object
[09:57:07] <ajpiano> hold on
[09:57:16] <ajpiano> <td>'s don't have a "Disabled" attribute or property
[09:57:21] <tintin> Then if you write lot of jqueyr using .bind() or .live() then after some years you have to re-write/replace all, that's a tedious task
[09:57:23] <jehe> you think its alright to require users to use javascript for your page to function these days?
[09:57:23] <whitenoise> right, but you can make one
[09:57:29] <ajpiano> i mean, if you add one, it will work, but it won't *do* anything
[09:57:34] <tintin> xmaddness: update what?
[09:57:55] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: it means something in his code. though should use data-disabled
[09:58:01] <ajpiano> +1
[09:58:04] <xmaddness> tintin: he is using jQuery 1.4
[09:58:09] <ryanneufeld> and jquery 1.7.2
[09:58:12] <tintin> No way
[09:58:32] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: can you upgrade to 1.7.2?
[09:58:32] <whitenoise> ajpiano, actually, jquery 1.6.1 seems to be the version
[09:58:40] <ryanneufeld> much better
[09:58:43] <whitenoise> 1.4 is what i used on a previous project.
[09:58:54] <ajpiano> whitenoise: well, in that case, if it were an element type that actually supported disabled, you should use the .prop() method
[09:58:55] <tintin> What are the other javascript library/api that is mostly used these days except jquery?
[09:59:04] <ajpiano> but since it's just an arbitrary custom attribute on a td, it shouldn't make a different
[09:59:12] <tintin> coffecat ?
[09:59:18] <sente> d3.js is very popular for data
[09:59:49] <ryanneufeld> tintin: have you heard of www.google.com ?
[10:00:11] <ajpiano> tintin: http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript
[10:00:14] <xmaddness> tintin: probably node, jquery, and prototype?
[10:00:15] <whitenoise> stepping through chrome's debugger. when it should be undefined works..now testing the disabled catch.
[10:00:25] <whitenoise> xmaddness, and mootools i guess
[10:01:13] <xmaddness> we use jquery exclusively here
[10:01:17] <xmaddness> and mustache
[10:01:21] <xmaddness> moment
[10:01:23] <GreekFreak> Why is this not displaying properly on fiddle?
[10:01:24] <GreekFreak> http://jsfiddle.net/tscholiadis/DFtgB/
[10:01:28] <whitenoise> handlebars > mustache :P
[10:01:35] <whitenoise> actually, i hate javascript tempting.
[10:01:40] <whitenoise> templating*
[10:02:25] <tintin> I don't prefer/suggest/recommend to set css rules from/using javascript/jquery , because javascript can be disabled somewhere, then all your css effect for your website is dump/gone/dead, so it's a dead website, what do you say guys?
[10:02:25] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak:not sure, but you don't need the element type in the css if you're using an ID
[10:02:42] <tintin> Do you feel the same way?
[10:02:44] <ajpiano> tintin: +1
[10:02:57] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak: uncheck the "normalized css" box
[10:03:03] <ajpiano> tintin: it's much better to toggle classes and stuff with javascript, and keep the actual styling rules in CSS
[10:03:11] <xmaddness> tintin: we have adopted a "if they don't have js, they don't see the site" attitude
[10:03:14] <whitenoise> ryanneufeld, ajpiano : http://pastie.org/4205355
[10:03:19] <whitenoise> it does not assume the first element.
[10:03:21] <whitenoise> now trying first()
[10:03:23] <GreekFreak> ryanneufeld, it's called desperation when things don't work lol. Can't see why it won't display it right here, and I need to ask the css guys why the calc is not working
[10:03:23] <ryanneufeld> tintin: what ajpiano said is right, we do that
[10:03:30] <GreekFreak> ryanneufeld, did, still nothing
[10:03:31] <ajpiano> whitenoise: there's only one element
[10:03:42] <whitenoise> ajpiano, right.
[10:03:48] <ajpiano> whitenoise: "disabled" might actually not be allowed on TDs, you might wnat to try using data-disabled
[10:03:58] <whitenoise> ajpiano, ah.
[10:03:58] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak: I don't know what it's supposed to look like, so I can't realy help you
[10:04:01] <ajpiano> whitenoise: so using "first" would have the effect of there being no effect
[10:04:16] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: and use .data('disabled') instead of attr
[10:04:37] <whitenoise> lets just ask this.
[10:04:55] <GreekFreak> ryanneufeld, uhm, a tab list. it's straight out of the demo
[10:04:55] <whitenoise> the td contains an abut the td is what actually triggers the selectable click event
[10:05:02] <whitenoise> how can I just set it to not do anything when its clicked?
[10:05:16] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/DFtgB/1/
[10:05:21] * whitenoise is a back-end, server-type person.
[10:05:23] <tintin> Use js for toggling class , that's good, but don't use js for setting css class rules or css id rules , what do you think/say/feel ?
[10:05:27] <whitenoise> i dislike javascript rather intensely.
[10:05:42] <ajpiano> tintin: that would be insane
[10:05:52] <tintin> whitenoise: what do you mean by that?  "whitenoise is a back-end, server-type person."
[10:06:02] <whitenoise> tintin, i mean exactly what i said
[10:06:03] <tintin> ajpiano: insane? why?
[10:06:18] <GreekFreak> ryanneufeld, uhm... I don't see anything
[10:06:20] <ajpiano> tintin: because once your app is running and they do have javascript, you're gonna have to manipulate classes with javascript
[10:06:23] <tintin> define server type person
[10:06:39] <whitenoise> tintin, are you sure you're not just trolling?
[10:06:42] <tintin> ajpiano: YOu didn't understand what i said
[10:06:59] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak: sorry, my bad
[10:07:02] <ajpiano> whitenoise: it sounds like you just need the equivalent of $("td a").click(function(e) { e.stopPropagation(); })
[10:07:27] <tintin> ajpiano: class rules and id rules will live in .css file, you won't set those rules with javascript, you will only assign class or toggle class
[10:07:30] <whitenoise> ajpiano, hm. but i need to remove that functionality later. i have basically created a semaphore.
[10:07:31] <tintin> using js
[10:07:33] <ajpiano> yes
[10:07:40] <xmaddness> ajpiano: that begs the questin as to why its a <a> in the first place though
[10:07:50] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak: looks like a  bug in jsfiddle
[10:07:55] <ajpiano> whitenoise: you can always unbind events in a variety of ways
[10:07:58] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak: it's trying to load http://fiddle.jshell.net/_display/ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.17/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css
[10:07:58] <GreekFreak> ryanneufeld, lol
[10:08:04] <ajpiano> tintin: i guess
[10:08:04] <ryanneufeld> and getting 404'd
[10:08:30] <ryanneufeld> tintin: That's what he already said.
[10:08:52] <tintin> ezio: Are you there?
[10:09:00] <GreekFreak> ryanneufeld, I'm gonna restart. for some reason css stuff works after that. I know it makes no sense but oh well lol
[10:09:28] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak: no, that was you adding the wrong url :P
[10:09:47] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak:
[10:09:51] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/DFtgB/2/
[10:10:17] <ryanneufeld> you missed the http:// on the link for the jquery ui css file
[10:10:27] * GreekFreak slaps his head
[10:10:38] <ryanneufeld> ?thatfeel @ GreekFreak
[10:10:39] <bot-t> GreekFreak, http://partner-ad.photobucket.com/albums/kk36/psycoyami/i_hug_that_feel.png
[10:10:56] <GreekFreak> ryanneufeld, haha :P
[10:11:24] <GreekFreak> ryanneufeld, if you look at that css, shouldn't the tab thing fill the page?
[10:11:42] <tintin> firefox-13.0 is it the latest?
[10:11:50] <GreekFreak> or rather less that 136px
[10:11:53] <tintin> How does firefox-3.6 come?
[10:12:21] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak: I've never seen css like that, and honestly it seems a little strange
[10:12:34] <jehe> "function jQuery.browser.mobile will be true if the browser is a mobile device" how do I check if its true? if( $(jQuery.browser.mobile) ) ?
[10:12:40] <MagePsycho> any good floating div box in jquery?
[10:12:42] <GreekFreak> ryanneufeld, lol thanks. it's CSS3
[10:12:56] <whitenoise> ajpiano, the data-disabled thing fixed it right up
[10:13:11] <ryanneufeld> MagePsycho: there are tones of jquery light box plugins. a google search will find them for you
[10:13:19] <ryanneufeld> MagePsycho: then you can choose one you like
[10:14:03] <ajpiano> whitenoise: in general it's not good to repurpose words with specific semantics in html/js and use them as arbitrary things in your code
[10:14:09] <rmurphey> jehe: by wrapping jQuery.browser.mobile in $() you are calling the jquery function and passing it jQuery.browser.mobile
[10:14:13] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak: perhaps it's not taking 100% of the document hight, but the height of the element
[10:14:18] <ajpiano> like, variables named "class" or elements with the id "submit"
[10:14:21] <rmurphey> so you don't need to do that :)
[10:14:21] <whitenoise> ajpiano, i understand. i'm learning more and more front-end stuff each day.
[10:14:35] <ajpiano> :)
[10:14:38] <whitenoise> ajpiano, jquery is by far my weakest area
[10:14:47] <GreekFreak> ryanneufeld, that's a good point
[10:14:48] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: then you're in the right place :)
[10:14:50] <ajpiano> its ok :) just a good one to hold in your head, that
[10:16:08] <whitenoise> ryanneufeld, someday when i'm not on company time, i'll play with jsfiddle
[10:16:15] <whitenoise> i just get confused with it when i have click events, ajax calls, etc
[10:16:40] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: doing it on company time is better, if they don't give you time to learn to do things, and learn new tools... They're missing out
[10:16:57] <ryanneufeld> I use jsfiddle for testing a lot of the new widgets I build
[10:17:14] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak: I'm not a CSS guy, sorry
[10:17:22] <ryanneufeld> GreekFreak: got your fiddle working though! GL
[10:17:22] <GreekFreak> ryanneufeld, no worries :P
[10:17:34] <GreekFreak> perfect ;) Now I'll go to the css guys haha
[10:17:59] <whitenoise> ryanneufeld, theoretically i could. i should probably more precisely say "not on client time"
[10:19:03] <xmaddness> jehe: I'm not familiar with jQuery.browser.mobile. That sounds like an add-on or plugin that is appending to the browser object
[10:19:07] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: yeah, I gotcha.  I find sometimes taking that extra hour to figure out a tool, has saved me hours of fighting later on. But when you have to deliver, you gotta git er done
[10:19:26] <ajpiano> whitenoise: you might like http://jsbin.com more, it's a bit more straightforward in how it puts the pieces together to do the live preview
[10:19:38] <ezio> tintin, you all fixed up?
[10:19:39] <ajpiano> insofar as you can just write a normal html page if you so desire
[10:19:45] <ajpiano> and include resources as normal
[10:19:47] <ryanneufeld> yeah, shallower learning curve.
[10:20:02] <xmaddness> jehe: you could find something like that here: http://jquerybyexample.blogspot.com/2012/03/detect-mobile-browsers-using-jquery.html
[10:20:31] <ryanneufeld> xmaddness I'm using that in prod right now :P
[10:20:34] <tintin> ezio: Yes
[10:20:51] <ryanneufeld> xmaddness: FYI it doesn't catch the BB playbook
[10:20:53] <tintin> ezio: Your lunch finished?
[10:21:02] <ezio> yup ... what time did i leave?
[10:21:09] <xmaddness> ryanneufeld: ahh good to know I guess, my questino is, who cares? :P
[10:21:19] <xmaddness> damn BB users
[10:21:42] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I got one of the playbooks blackberry was giving away at the jqconf
[10:21:49] <ryanneufeld> I can see why they are giving them away though
[10:21:59] <ryanneufeld> there is no compelling reason to buy one
[10:22:10] <ryanneufeld> and the apps are all mostly junk
[10:22:35] <ryanneufeld> but the dev process is simple, pretty much like phonegap. RippleUI is great.
[10:22:38] <ezio> 1:25
[10:22:39] <ezio> good
[10:22:53] <ryanneufeld> If they can get the device into developer hands, maybe the landscape will improve
[10:23:45] <rmurphey> giving them to developers probably lets them write off the inventory as marketing
[10:23:53] <rmurphey> rather than "sitting in a warehouse, never to be purchased"
[10:23:58] <ryanneufeld> rmurphey: that too
[10:24:14] <ryanneufeld> rmurphey: It's a $200 tablet I didn't have to pay for, I'm not complaining
[10:24:21] <rmurphey> mine's in my closet :)
[10:24:24] <ryanneufeld> I just find it doesn't have that much to offer me
[10:24:33] <rmurphey> along with my cr-48
[10:24:34] <ryanneufeld> I have an android phone, and an ipad
[10:24:41] <tintin> ezio: :23
[10:24:42] <ryanneufeld> and a macbook pro
[10:25:16] <tintin> ezio: You left around 15 minutes ago
[10:25:17] <ryanneufeld> rmurphey: what did you think of the cr-48?
[10:25:32] <ezio> nah i left at 12:24
[10:25:49] <ezio> i just realized i can use irc chat logs to tell when i come and go
[10:25:59] * ryanneufeld assumes not as impressed as it's in a closet
[10:26:18] <rmurphey> ryanneufeld: the physical device pretty much sucks
[10:26:23] <rmurphey> the trackpad is almost unusable
[10:26:34] <ryanneufeld> :(
[10:26:37] <rmurphey> the power jack is ridiculously flimsy
[10:26:45] <rmurphey> the OS tho is fine :)
[10:26:47] <ryanneufeld> weren't they sill cheap?
[10:26:51] <ryanneufeld> *silly
[10:26:57] <rmurphey> mine was free
[10:27:02] <ryanneufeld> that's pretty cheap
[10:27:04] <rmurphey> yeah
[10:27:07] <rmurphey> but i have an air
[10:27:15] <ryanneufeld> air > cr-48
[10:27:18] <ryanneufeld> all day long
[10:27:27] <ryanneufeld> I want the new retina 15
[10:27:30] <bencahill> Hey guys, I'm making an app that will send ajax requests to the server to change stuff in the database. How should I get started at implementing this, and handling errors?
[10:27:40] <tintin> ezio: Which irc client you use?
[10:27:47] <ezio> ychat
[10:28:15] <tintin> ychat or xchat ?
[10:28:16] <ryanneufeld> bencahill: that's a broad question.  which part are you struggling with?
[10:28:36] <ryanneufeld> tintin: ezio can you guys take it to a private chat?
[10:28:57] <ezio> oh you fuddy duddy
[10:29:05] <tintin> Ok
[10:29:08] <ryanneufeld> 'scuse me?
[10:29:09] <bencahill> ryanneufeld: I haven't written any code for the ajax yet, I'm just trying to figure out how I should do it...especially in regards to error handling. (e.g. how should I send errors from PHP, and how should I handle them in JS?)
[10:29:24] <rmurphey> bencahill: generally your server would define an api
[10:29:25] <ryanneufeld> bencahill: ah, well, that's up to you.
[10:29:29] <rmurphey> probably a RESTful API
[10:29:34] <ryanneufeld> ^^
[10:29:34] <rmurphey> that you would talk to with $.ajax
[10:29:36] <ryanneufeld> that
[10:29:44] * bencahill rests for a while
[10:29:46] <rmurphey> so, you'd POST to /people/123
[10:29:46] <bencahill> :P
[10:29:52] <xmaddness> preferably a rest
[10:29:57] <rmurphey> or GET /people/123
[10:29:57] <xmaddness> join the new age
[10:29:59] <rmurphey> or something
[10:30:15] <rmurphey> basically you want to be talking to your server via an API of some sort
[10:30:21] <rmurphey> and it's up to you what that api looks like
[10:30:25] <ryanneufeld> bencahill: so, what we do is every request response has one value that is always there "success"
[10:30:42] <bencahill> Ok, this is good, because I haven't done much of the inter (between interface and server) coding yet
[10:30:48] <rmurphey> or you can just send standard http response codes
[10:30:51] <ryanneufeld> we check for that value to see if was true/false. Also we mix in http status codes were applicable
[10:30:58] <ezio> ryanneufeld, it's an old term people used to use to describe old people who are strict
[10:31:09] <bencahill> I've got everything in the backend in nice classes, but don't have an interface like you're talking about...that seems like the next step.
[10:31:15] <ezio> like 1910 style
[10:31:21] <ryanneufeld> bencahill: what's your backend built with?
[10:31:26] <ryanneufeld> (curious_
[10:31:37] <bencahill> ryanneufeld: Just straight PHP...this will be a very small app for my needs.
[10:31:42] <bencahill> (image management app)
[10:31:45] <ajpiano> ezio: it's not overbearing to ask that extended chat between two people that strays from the subject of the channel be taken to a PM :)
[10:32:06] <ezio> yes but it gave me a chance to use fuddy duddy in a sentence. BAM!
[10:32:18] <ajpiano> fair enough
[10:32:30] <tintin> Which bot is used here?
[10:32:39] <ryanneufeld> simple pleasures I suppose
[10:33:00] <bencahill> If anyone's curious: https://github.com/bencahill/lightize
[10:33:11] <ryanneufeld> well, to build a restful api like rmurphey suggested (a good idea)
[10:33:15] <bencahill> There's probably a ton of stuff that could be improved. I'm still very new at all of this.
[10:33:29] <bencahill> (I consider myself a power user, not a programmer)
[10:33:42] <ryanneufeld> can take a lot of work
[10:33:52] <ryanneufeld> to build from scratch
[10:33:55] <bencahill> bbiab
[10:34:09] <rmurphey> ryanneufeld: for something simple, you may want to consider a framework like rails
[10:34:15] <rmurphey> or a similar php framework
[10:34:19] <bencahill> ryanneufeld: Okay, yeah.
[10:34:23] <rmurphey> that will set up the rest stuff for you
[10:34:24] <ryanneufeld> rmurphey: I was gonna suggest codeigniter
[10:34:32] <ryanneufeld> since he's using php
[10:34:33] <rmurphey> yeah i'm not well-versed in php land :)
[10:34:40] <ryanneufeld> it gives you the restful URI for free
[10:34:47] <ryanneufeld> has all the routing built in
[10:35:04] <ryanneufeld> and you can learn it in about an hour if you know some basic php, which bencahill seems to
[10:35:17] <bencahill> Yeah, I heavily considered using a framework (I'm using Yii in another project), but I think it's complete overkill for this...
[10:35:28] <ryanneufeld> Yii is another good one
[10:35:32] <ryanneufeld> I don't know it
[10:35:39] <ryanneufeld> but I've heard nice things said about it
[10:35:51] <ryanneufeld> avoid cake like tha plague (IMHO)
[10:35:53] <bencahill> ...I'll have basically one 'page', with thumbnails and a lightbox-type thing for larger previews...no pages for individual pictures or anything.
[10:36:15] <rmurphey> bencahill: it may be that a full restful interface is overkill too then, but
[10:36:25] <rmurphey> the bottom line is, send abstract instructions to your server
[10:36:28] <jehe> gaah, I hate that the jquery plugin page is down, not even the archive is working
[10:36:30] <rmurphey> don't send, like, SQL :)
[10:36:40] <ryanneufeld> yeah...
[10:36:42] <ryanneufeld> that would be bad
[10:36:49] * xmaddness hasn't written a query in over a year
[10:36:57] <xmaddness> SOA baby
[10:37:06] <ryanneufeld> SOA?
[10:37:10] <bencahill> rmurphey: Um, yeah. :P
[10:37:13] <bencahill> Okay, bbiab.
[10:37:25] <xmaddness> ryanneufeld: service oriented architecture
[10:37:38] <ryanneufeld> ah yes, the new
[10:37:42] <ryanneufeld> 'hot thing
[10:37:44] <ryanneufeld> '
[10:37:46] <xmaddness> backend servixces do the aggregation, I just call their apis
[10:37:47] <xmaddness> rest
[10:39:23] <ajpiano> jehe: archive is back up, sorry bout that
[10:39:35] <jehe> ^^,
[10:41:56] <jehe> ajpiano I dont know how its suppose to look like but are all documentation and downloads down? http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/ajaxFileUpload
[10:42:27] <ajpiano> jehe: downloads were broken long before we moved it to the archive
[10:42:35] <jehe> I see
[10:42:37] <ajpiano> and documentation is on the maintainers page so it's not on us
[10:42:48] <jehe> guess I'll have to wait till it becomes available then
[10:43:02] <ajpiano> jehe:  there are much more modern uploaders
[10:43:08] <ajpiano> like uploadify and plupload
[10:43:11] <ajpiano> might wanna look into those instead
[10:43:30] <jehe> am after something simple really
[10:43:51] <jehe> and I need to be able to configure it to my site, but ill look at it
[10:43:55] <ajpiano> jehe: the jquery form plugin also handles uploads very simply
[10:44:22] <ajpiano> anyway, do your research :)
[10:44:27] <jehe> but I like uploadify
[10:49:50] <zsoc> this is driving me nuts. i have container.delegate working fine on one page to call some ajax, and on another page it's not catching the keyup... almost everything is identical
[10:50:26] <zsoc> i just answered my own question
[10:50:35] <zsoc> i have been staring at this for 20 minutes and all i had to do was type it out
[10:50:45] <zsoc> the container doesn't have the name id...ha.

[10:59:56] <tintin> What is level 94 ?
[11:00:06] <hlveheart> that's his level of knowledge
[11:00:06] <hlveheart> 94.
[11:00:19] <tintin> What does that mean by 94?
[11:00:32] <hlveheart> You're overthinking this joke, really.
[11:01:23] <tintin> hlveheart: "Idk how he got all the way to level 94, but he is a level 94 jquery wizard " , but how did you repeat this exact line, you told this line before when i joined today here
[11:01:24] <jehe> ajpiano any ETA on the downloads?
[11:01:30] <tintin> hlveheart: How did you find that exact line?

[11:01:53] <ajpiano> jehe: that site is going away completely, we aren't going to offer "downloads" like that

[11:08:49] <ajpiano> there are much more productive ways for a newcomer to use this channel than picking fights
[11:08:54] <ajpiano> hlveheart isn't a bot.
[11:09:10] <tintin> But he acted like a good AI bot
[11:09:16] <ezio> the bot molested me

[11:20:38] <Crimlo> ryan you cannot offend me
[11:20:54] <Crimlo> ryan get over yourself dude
[11:21:09] <ryanneufeld> Crimlo: calling me names doesn't help, and doesn't make me want to ever help you.
[11:21:35] <tintin> Would you guys stop discussing other but jquery?
[11:21:43] <granden> If I got $(".Button").click(function(){ console.log($(this).index())}); it echos out only 0 even if I got 4 elements with the class Button
[11:21:59] <granden> how could I group em, and have an individual id for every one of them?
[11:22:04] <ajpiano> Crimlo: please stop picking fights
[11:22:17] <tintin> granden: gist.github.com the complete code what you have done
[11:22:28] <ryanneufeld> ?index() @ granden

[11:22:45] <rmurphey> Crimlo: you called him a douchebag
[11:22:53] <Crimlo> oh
[11:22:54] <rmurphey> in case you forgot
[11:23:17] <Crimlo> i was speaking in general.. but if he thought i was maybe he is
[11:23:27] <ajpiano> you also said "get over yourself" etc.
[11:23:36] <Crimlo> he needs to
[11:23:53] <tintin> granden: What are ou trying to do?
[11:23:54] <Crimlo> i was just protecting tintin
[11:24:00] <ryanneufeld> granden: it looks like you're miss-understanding what index() does
[11:24:08] <tintin> granden: To find the index of button
[11:24:35] <ryanneufeld> granden: what you might want to do if you're looking to work with each elemen in the list is see ?each
[11:24:36] <bot-t> granden, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[11:24:36] <granden> Wow, many responses at once, sorry for not answering quicker. Was just getting a glass of water haha :)
[11:24:52] <ryanneufeld> granden: see ?index()
[11:24:52] <bot-t> granden, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[11:24:57] <ryanneufeld> granden: see ?each()
[11:24:57] <bot-t> granden, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[11:25:07] <granden> Dont want to iterate over all of them.
[11:25:17] <granden> just to match a specific one.
[11:25:21] <ryanneufeld> granden: okay
[11:25:21] <granden> and work with that.
[11:25:30] <ryanneufeld> so, how do you know which one you want?
[11:25:39] <granden> Its to much code to put on a pastebin with links etc.
[11:25:40] <ryanneufeld> is it the 3rd? does it have a class?
[11:25:57] <granden> -links + images ;)
[11:26:19] <ryanneufeld> granden: when you use the .something selector
[11:26:30] <ryanneufeld> you're going to get an array of the elements that have that class
[11:26:35] <ryanneufeld> I think you knew that though
[11:26:41] <granden> yeah exactly
[11:26:46] <ryanneufeld> so are you trying to match just the one that was clicked?
[11:26:48] <granden> actesolutions.se/produktlista.php?id=11 that page for example.
[11:27:00] <granden> the meny to the left, trying to work with that.
[11:27:10] <ryanneufeld> sec, I'm looking
[11:27:13] <ryanneufeld> okay, I have it open
[11:27:24] <granden> and using the console I print out the element id.
[11:27:31] <granden> or what I try to do at least.
[11:27:45] <granden> now it always prints +
[11:27:46] <granden> +
[11:27:47] <granden> 0*
[11:27:53] <ryanneufeld> you're elements don't have ids
[11:28:00] <ryanneufeld> and index won't give you what you're looking for
[11:28:13] <tw2113> your*
[11:28:15] <tw2113> *flees*
[11:28:24] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: thanks, I do that all the time lol
[11:28:32] <MagePsycho> any floating div plugin for jquery ? REF: http://www.mkyong.com/wp-content/uploads/jQuery/jQuery-Mashable-floating-effect-example.html
[11:28:44] <granden> ryanneufeld: But why do they need ids? Is not a class enough?
[11:28:50] <granden> I got the same class on all those elements.
[11:28:58] <granden> wants it to print out 0-3
[11:29:16] <ryanneufeld> granden: I don't see the button class anywhere
[11:29:18] <hlveheart> tintin is a level 13 jquery wizard
[11:29:20] <tw2113> MagePsycho all that does is make the element fixed past a certain distance scrolled
[11:29:40] <granden> ryanneufeld: I did a simplefied version in the irc.
[11:29:47] <granden> look for menyknappar
[11:29:50] <granden> in the code on that page
[11:29:55] <tw2113> MagePsycho you could get everything you need by viewing the source code
[11:29:55] <granden> a class
[11:30:23] <ryanneufeld> $('.menyknappar') is an empty array
[11:30:28] <ryanneufeld> so that class doesn't exist
[11:30:36] <ryanneufeld> I see class='AccordionTitle'
[11:31:12] <ryanneufeld> and divs with ids like "AccordianContainer" and "Accorion1Content" <- has 1-4 for those
[11:31:35] <granden> though
[11:31:52] <ryanneufeld> ?
[11:32:14] <granden> it was not even named menyknappar haha
[11:32:18] <granden> if you look at the
[11:32:25] <granden> $(".AccordionTitle")
[11:32:33] <MagePsycho> tw2113: yeah but i need robust plugin as such kinda code sucks in some browsers
[11:32:50] <ryanneufeld> granden: yes, that's pretty much what i said :p
[11:33:08] <granden> ryanneufeld: But why is it printing out 0 to the console
[11:33:12] <ryanneufeld> granden: so, you're trying to tell when one of those AccordionTitle elements has been clicked
[11:33:13] <granden> and not what you said, 1-4 or such?
[11:33:32] <ryanneufeld> granden: I said twice above, index doesn't do what you think it does
[11:33:41] <ryanneufeld> ?index() @granden
[11:33:41] <bot-t> granden, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[11:34:01] <tw2113> MagePsycho i question how many browsers that code would throw fits in
[11:34:35] <tintin> shoky: Hi
[11:35:00] <granden> ryanneufeld: Ah sorry
[11:35:11] <ryanneufeld> granden: yeah, so that's why you're getting 0 :p
[11:35:23] <granden> Ok, what is it I would want then instead?
[11:35:55] <hlveheart> shoky, where are you, hero-boy?
[11:35:56] <hlveheart> :>
[11:36:06] <shoky> just woke up
[11:36:14] <shoky> how do you guys do that
[11:36:31] <shoky> i opened the monitor this instance
[11:36:41] <ryanneufeld> granden: why is it that you need the number?
[11:36:53] <tintin> shoking hero
[11:36:54] <ryanneufeld> granden: you have 'this' which the thing clicked on
[11:36:55] <tintin> lol
[11:37:09] <shoky> sups
[11:37:18] <tintin> shoky: hlveheart told you have 94 leve jquery magic :)
[11:37:24] <alcuadrado> is there something like a "remove" synthetic event in jquery?
[11:37:43] <granden> ryanneufeld: Because for every meny button there is a content-div. That I want to run slidToggle on
[11:37:46] <ryanneufeld> alcuadrado: remove in what sense
[11:38:05] <granden> slideToggle()
[11:38:23] <alcuadrado> ryanneufeld,  an event to attach to on removing an element
[11:38:29] <alcuadrado> removing with jquery
[11:38:46] <xmaddness> perhaps a jsfiddle would be of help here?
[11:38:48] <granden> when clicknig .AccordionTitle element I want to do $(corresponding .Accordioncontent).slideToggle
[11:38:51] <ryanneufeld> oh, there is domevents for that, I'm pretty sure that jquery doesn't actually do that
[11:38:52] <tintin> shoky: What's the time there?
[11:38:53] <granden> ryanneufeld: If you understand what I try to do.
[11:38:54] <tintin> shoky: good morning?
[11:39:35] <ryanneufeld> granden: I thin you should check this out: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#default
[11:39:59] <tintin> Does resig join here?
[11:40:01] <ryanneufeld> granden: the markup is easy to write, and you can easily apply your CSS instead of the one that ships with it.
[11:40:21] <shoky> ;]
[11:40:30] <shoky> tintin it's 9:40 PM
[11:40:35] <shoky> good morning ;P
[11:40:50] <tintin> shoky: So why did you wake up now?
[11:40:58] <tintin> shoky: YOu should sleep now again
[11:41:09] <shoky> im a night person
[11:41:18] <tintin> Why?
[11:41:40] <tintin> Do you go to office now to work?
[11:41:54] <shoky> night is darker/quieter/colder
[11:42:20] <shoky> nah. worked a ton yesterday
[11:42:38] <tw2113> shoky likes being awake when fewer aresholes are
[11:42:46] <granden> ryanneufeld: Hmm
[11:42:49] <shoky> ^that
[11:42:58] <tintin> shoky: Which company do you work with?
[11:43:01] <granden> but this way should be possible! I'm stubborn :)
[11:43:11] <granden> I will try work on my way a bit more, but thanks alot.
[11:43:19] <granden> It is at least one step in teh right direction.
[11:43:24] <ryanneufeld> granden: it is, but you need to put some information like a class, or id on the elements being clicked
[11:43:38] <granden> there is, it got .AccordionTitle
[11:43:53] <ryanneufeld> k, I mean one to uniquely identify the one being clicked on
[11:44:00] <granden> hmm
[11:44:14] <granden> if you look at the startpage, I done something similair, actesolutions.se
[11:44:30] <granden> for the imageButtons dunno why it's not working for this just.
[11:46:47] <mprentice> is it common practice to do (function ($) { ... })(jQuery); ?
[11:47:03] <ryanneufeld> mprentice: yes, if you're writing a plugin
[11:47:21] <mprentice> ah. and if you're just writing an app?
[11:47:33] <ryanneufeld> still not a bad idea
[11:47:53] <ryanneufeld> means that if something else calls noConflict() later
[11:48:03] <ryanneufeld> you can still us3 $ within your closure
[11:49:51] <mprentice> ryanneufeld: cool, thanks. i'm just learning as i go with js, jquery, phonegap, kinda feels like my brain will explode
[11:50:07] <ryanneufeld> that'll happen
[11:50:11] <ryanneufeld> ?thatfeel @mprentice
[11:50:12] <bot-t> mprentice, http://partner-ad.photobucket.com/albums/kk36/psycoyami/i_hug_that_feel.png
[11:52:54] <granden> ryanneufeld: What do I need to do in jquery to get my stuff worknig? Without ui extension.
[11:53:30] <mprentice> ryanneufeld: :P
[11:53:52] <granden> I mean, as it identifies the right button, why can't it not just get the correct index-number for that elem.
[11:53:58] <ryanneufeld> granden: it is, but you need to put some information like a class, or id on the elements being clicked
[11:53:58] <ryanneufeld> 11:43 granden
[11:53:58] <ryanneufeld> there is, it got .AccordionTitle
[11:53:59] <ryanneufeld> ryanneufeld
[11:54:01] <ryanneufeld> k, I mean one to uniquely identify the one being clicked on
[11:54:13] <ryanneufeld> granden: how would it know the index?
[11:54:25] <granden> by $(this)?
[11:54:32] <ryanneufeld> how does it know?
[11:54:37] <granden> dunno haha
[11:54:41] <ryanneufeld> it doesn't
[11:55:08] <granden> so if I do, $(this).addClass("active");
[11:55:19] <granden> could I after that find the index for that in the array?
[11:55:26] <ryanneufeld> that could help
[11:55:28] <ryanneufeld> yeah,
[11:55:38] <ryanneufeld> but even then, you have an array of ONE thing
[11:56:09] <granden> hmm
[11:56:32] <ryanneufeld> if you had in your html class="AccordionTitle" data-tab="embedded"
[11:56:46] <ryanneufeld> then you can say: $(this).data('tab')
[11:56:50] <ryanneufeld> and get embedded
[11:57:18] <ryanneufeld> then if the content has class="embedded <other possible classes" or even id="embedded"
[11:57:26] <hlveheart> Idk how he got all the way to level 94, but he is a level 94 jquery wizard
[11:57:40] <hlveheart> shoky is a level 94 jquery wizard
[11:57:54] <ryanneufeld> you can do: $('.embedded').slideToggle() or $('#embedded').slideToggle()
[11:58:15] <NoiseEee> anyone know if Chrome debugger has a similar plugin like Firequery?
[11:59:58] <ryanneufeld> ?g firequery for webkit inspector @ NoiseEee
[12:00:00] <bot-t> NoiseEee, frameworks - What is in your JavaScript toolchain? - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1480186/what-is-in-your-javascript-toolchain
[12:00:07] <ryanneufeld> ha, usesless
[12:00:16] <hlveheart> lol
[12:00:24] <NoiseEee> i'll google it, thanks ryanneufeld
[12:00:43] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I was gonna throw you a lmgtfy.com link
[12:00:48] <hlveheart> lol
[12:01:01] <hlveheart> ryanneufeld has leveled up to a Level 13 jQuery wizard
[12:01:26] <NoiseEee> yeah but no good, i'm looking for something for the debugger like firequery provides for firebug
[12:01:31] <xmaddness> NoiseEee: Not that I have found
[12:01:37] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I haven't found one
[12:01:41] <xmaddness> NoiseEee: let me know if you find one though :D
[12:01:43] <NoiseEee> drag thanks
[12:01:47] <ryanneufeld> but I find that one *really* boggs down the computer
[12:01:52] <ryanneufeld> it's a memory hog
[12:01:54] * bencahill is back
[12:01:54] <granden> ryanneufeld: I dont really follow about that tab -stuffs.
[12:01:55] <xmaddness> (or make one, that would be cool too)
[12:02:11] <ryanneufeld> ?data() @ granden
[12:02:12] <bot-t> granden, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[12:02:48] <xmaddness> I find that the jQuery api docs on data is lacking
[12:03:00] <granden> If you look at, this now, http://actesolutions.se/produktlista.php?id=11 that is how all the buttos should look like when opened. But only if they got any content. ofcourse.
[12:03:12] <hlveheart> where their api docs lack, stackoverflow picks up
[12:03:23] <xmaddness> yeh
[12:03:25] <granden> ryanneufeld: I dont think that is what I acctually should do, seams over complicated for something that should be fairly simple.
[12:04:16] <ryanneufeld> granden: okay. Good luck
[12:04:17] <xmaddness> granden: what are you trying to do? Pass stuff into jQuery from the HTML or server side?
[12:04:39] <ryanneufeld>  
[12:04:41] <xmaddness> using data- attributes?
[12:04:49] * bencahill wonders how people got anything done before SO.
[12:04:52] * xmaddness loves data- attribs
[12:04:55] <ryanneufeld> xmaddness: no, that was my suggestion
[12:05:02] <xmaddness> yeah
[12:05:12] <xmaddness> not sure how that is complicated really :P
[12:05:14] <ryanneufeld> xmaddness: he's trying to get an index for a clicked item in the click handler
[12:05:17] <bencahill> xmaddness: Heh, I'm using them in my app, they seem to be quite handy. :P
[12:05:27] <ryanneufeld> we use them all over our site
[12:05:29] <xmaddness> they are extremely handy
[12:05:31] <ryanneufeld> they're fantastic
[12:05:39] <bencahill> Handy = they have many hands.
[12:05:41] <hlveheart> you're extremely handy and fantastic
[12:05:52] <xmaddness> we use them all over also
[12:05:53] * hlveheart slaps ryanneufeld around a bit with a large trout
[12:06:10] <xmaddness> some of our data attribs are oh
[12:06:18] <xmaddness> about 1k?
[12:06:23] <xmaddness> :x
[12:06:28] <bencahill> hlveheart: I would suggest slapping around a byte next time.
[12:06:34] * ryanneufeld ninja flips and chops hlveheart's head off, and doesn't even care. Cause that's what ninja's do
[12:06:41] <bencahill> BAM!
[12:06:42] <ryanneufeld> 
[12:06:46] <bencahill> o.0
[12:07:06] <hlveheart> 
[12:07:06] <hlveheart> lol
[12:07:08] <bencahill> xmaddness: Oh my!
[12:07:09] <hlveheart> i love it
[12:08:36] <granden> xmaddness: I got a div-container and inside that 8 divs, 4 with a title class, AccordionTitle, and 4 with a content-class, AccordionContent. When clicking AccordionTitle second, i want to run slideToggle() on the corresponding AccordionContent
[12:09:04] <granden> I got a similair script on the index.php page wher eit works as it should.
[12:09:07] <hlveheart> 
[12:09:28] <bencahill> Uh oh...
[12:09:42] <bencahill> I haven't looked at my written notes for the app in several days...
[12:09:46] * bencahill reviews
[12:11:20] <xmaddness> granden: I would probabaly mess with the dom a bit, split the 8 divs into two sets of 4
[12:11:32] <xmaddness> on click, do an each and get the eq of that element
[12:11:44] <xmaddness> then call the slidetoggle on the other set where eq = x
[12:11:54] <xmaddness> something like that
[12:12:05] <xmaddness> or do a data-id
[12:12:17] <xmaddness> and just do a selector for the other based on a data-id
[12:12:24] <xmaddness> numerous ways to do it
[12:12:29] <granden> hmm
[12:13:11] <granden> xmaddness: I know the div is like this, <div container><div title></div><div content></div><div title></div><div content></div>
[12:13:26] <granden> so that way I think it should be possible to have them in the same right?

[12:13:56] <xmaddness> granden: I agree, create a jsfiddle and this will get done in a 1oth of the time

[12:15:06] <granden> hlveheart: Sorry, missed that you wrote the same thing :(
[12:15:12] <granden> can I use external js-files and css-files with
[12:15:17] <hlveheart> it's all good
[12:15:17] <granden> fiddle?
[12:15:17] <hlveheart> lol
[12:15:20] <hlveheart> yeah
[12:15:23] <malorie> hi! how can I map over a list returned by a child selector? e.g. what I want to do is something like: $('#bla > div').each(toggle)
[12:15:30] <granden> hlveheart: How would I do that?
[12:15:50] <granden> ah
[12:15:51] <granden> nice
[12:15:55] <granden> if the CSS uses images
[12:16:01] <granden> it is still relative to the css-file?
[12:16:13] <hlveheart> no, hardlink
[12:16:14] <hlveheart> lol
[12:17:29] <granden> damn it

[12:30:12] <silverwind> arena, http://jsfiddle.net/TeGMv/2/
[12:30:57] <arena> Silverwind, wonderful. Thanks.
[12:32:13] <granden> xmaddness: Are you around?
[12:33:44] <monk12> hello all, had a quick question. I have a hyperlink that has 2 click events attached to it... They both call functions that return false, yet the hyperlink still works... I was just curious what would stop it from 'clicking through'. Thought 'return false' was enough (dont think i need to use evt.preventDefault()). Here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/QskMU/
[12:34:46] <someprimetime> put return false in the click event
[12:34:47] <someprimetime> @monk12
[12:34:55] <someprimetime> otherwise you are returning false from that function
[12:35:01] <someprimetime> not the one that registers the event
[12:35:26] <someprimetime> and e.preventDefault() is the same as return false (which also includes e.stopPropagation())
[12:35:35] <m0dmd_> hey everyone
[12:35:36] <elijahmanor> arena, the on() you are using only uses 2 arguments which is essentially the same as a bind(). as silverwind rewrote your code it takes the document as the context and uses 3 parameters for the event delegation
[12:39:34] <monk12> someprimetime, thanks for your input. hmmm, i was trying to keep the code more cleaner cause my code looks closer to this: http://jsfiddle.net/QskMU/3/  is there anyway i can do something liek that without copying/plastic the function trackGoogleEvent's contents into each click event?
[12:41:08] <elijahmanor> monk12: i think someprimetime was just saying do this...   $('.google_tracking_url').click(function(){ return trackGoogleURL(); }); however, you may not really want to be "return false" because it breaks event delegation
[12:41:39] <monk12>  elijahmanor: oh crap, yes that makes sense. thanks.
[12:41:57] <monk12> thanks someprimetime/ elijahmanor
[12:41:59] <elijahmanor> monk12: n p
[12:42:52] <someprimetime> +1
[12:44:55] <elijahmanor> monk12: fyi, 'return false' is equivalent to e.preventDefault() & e.stopPropagation()
[12:45:19] <silverwind> Just forget that return false exists..
[12:46:10] <hashpuppy> what's a good way to $(document).ready(...) for only a page w/ #some_form on it?
[12:46:29] <hashpuppy> add a check for #some_form at the top?
[12:48:22] <monk12> silverwind, why forget 'return false' exists? Are you saying just use e.preventDefault() + e.stopPropagation() to be explicit in your code?
[12:48:37] <silverwind> monk12, pretty much.
[12:48:50] <monk12> gotcha k.
[12:48:53] <silverwind> monk12, return false doesn't really show the intent.
[12:55:40] <granden> Maybe someone arround who could help me with my menu to the left. on this page, http://actesolutions.se/produktlista.php?id=11 it always opens and closes the first one.
[12:55:50] <jehe> When having an upload script, is it possible to do this? var file = $('.fileupload').val(); fileupload is the <input type="file"> is its value valid to be sent via $.post to a php file?
[12:55:51] <granden> I would like it to open the clicked one, and then close the old one.
[12:55:57] <jehe> I mean can I work with that value?
[12:59:13] <Koganei> granden: checking
[13:00:00] <Koganei> where the js?
[13:01:01] <granden> Koganei: Thanks!
[13:01:19] <Koganei> granden: can you point me to the js th?ough
[13:01:23] <granden> and for some reason my green-div, contentdiv is two high so its not border-toborder.
[13:01:25] <Koganei> though?
[13:02:01] <granden> Koganei: var menyknappar
[13:02:09] <granden> is the first line in that js-snippet that I need help with.
[13:02:15] <Koganei> oh yeah
[13:02:26] <Koganei> sorry, didn't click it right my bad
[13:02:31] <granden> no problemo
[13:03:18] <Koganei> index isn't right
[13:03:30] <Koganei> should probably be boxes.index(this)
[13:03:38] <Koganei> for clickedButtonIndex
[13:05:20] <Koganei> granden ^
[13:05:37] <granden> ok will give it a try
[13:05:59] <Koganei> index matches the element in the bracket to a child of the jquery element
[13:06:53] <granden> Koganei: Now it dont open any
[13:06:56] <granden> :)
[13:07:37] <granden> ok now it opens one
[13:07:40] <granden> but not the correct one
[13:07:44] <Koganei> heh
[13:08:07] <granden> dunno which acctually
[13:08:10] <Koganei> is it always the one after or the one before? depends if things are 0-indexed or 1-indexed I suppose. Sorry I'm half paying attention
[13:08:28] <granden> Koganei: The div that should open
[13:08:37] <granden> is the div directloy after
[13:08:57] <granden> buttons are, 0,2,4,6...
[13:09:07] <granden> and content-divs are, 1,3,5,7
[13:09:07] <Koganei> k one sec let me look at the code
[13:11:56] <larzen-wrk2> Folks.. I have a component like datetimepicker ...
[13:12:17] <larzen-wrk2> Folks.. I have a component like datetimepicker ... and I want to make sure it hides when I click anywhere outside
[13:12:51] <larzen-wrk2> i have no idea how to implement this such that it is effective... seems like the little hacks that are online do not seem to work well.
[13:13:44] <Koganei> granden: it might be easier to do things like $(this).next() to choose the content
[13:14:45] <granden> hmm ok
[13:14:50] <granden> but if I want to close the old one
[13:14:54] * hlveheart slaps granden around a bit with a large trout
[13:14:59] <Koganei> granden: just close them all
[13:15:02] <Koganei> before opening one
[13:15:02] <hlveheart> 
[13:15:04] <granden> hlveheart: Ey there you are :)
[13:15:08] <granden> Never heard from you after my pastebin
[13:15:15] <hlveheart> didn't see it
[13:15:15] <granden> ;)
[13:15:16] <hlveheart> my bad :(
[13:15:20] <granden> oh
[13:15:25] <granden> perhaps I got a solution now though.
[13:15:30] <hlveheart> that's good ;P
[13:15:38] <granden> Koganei: got a tips, gonna try it now.
[13:16:58] <granden> Koganei: Hm nothing happens
[13:17:02] <granden> think it is because of my selectors
[13:17:14] <granden> $("#accordion .AccordionTitle")
[13:17:27] <granden> that only selects all the buttons
[13:17:37] <granden> not the boxes that should open/close.
[13:20:44] <tubbo`work> if i have a .click() event already bound to a callback, would binding another .click() to the same element cause the first .click() to be overridden?
[13:22:53] <silverwind> Nope
[13:23:08] <silverwind> That would trigger the two .click handlers one after the other
[13:26:23] <xboi209> Is there a way I can load content from a specific div from another domain without being restricted to the same origin policy?
[13:27:57] <john-dev> xboi209, did you try .load?
[13:28:03] <granden> Koganei: What happened?
[13:28:21] <xboi209> i didnt try it because the documentation said it was restricted
[13:28:36] <john-dev> hmh, give it a try? :-)
[13:29:23] <xboi209> ok
[13:30:11] <john-dev> you could use a php script that will download and filter this div and send it back to your ajax request, im not sure if there is an easier possibility
[13:31:10] <jaseemabid> What method is suggested to attach events to dom elements that dont exixst yet, but will be added in the future ?
[13:31:16] <ryanneufeld> john-dev: I have no idea what problem you're trying to solve, but i can say that doing it that way is very slow.
[13:31:38] <jaseemabid> live/delegate/on ?
[13:32:01] <john-dev> ryanneufeld, since there might be no other possibility, he should try..
[13:32:06] <danzik17> ryanneufeld: just curious, i know you've got some bug reading vids from jqcon - do you happen to know if there's vids of any of the other talks up anywhere?
[13:32:56] <ryanneufeld> danzik17: they were recorded, but I don't know who has em, or where they are
[13:33:00] <ryanneufeld> I'd like to know too
[13:34:54] <squeakita> Hi All, http://pastebin.com/0TZzF81R i am a noob, can someone help me ignore validation if I click an object? Also - should I be using buttons instead of images? thanks
[13:44:27] <aghouseh> im trying to trace a weird behavior with the combination of jquery ui dialog, draggable, resizable, and sortable making my form elements un focus() able. if i remove the class of the parent, the elements respond fine, so it has to be a .delegate() or .live() function.. but i cannot trace what exactly is capturing the focus event. any suggestions as to how to go about tracking this thing down?
[13:44:48] <granden> Where is the default color for a jquery ui button/slider specified? The active and non active states?
[13:44:53] <granden> dunno where to search in my css-files.
[13:45:37] <catcher> granden, firebug will help you locate the rule you need to change.
[13:46:05] <granden> catcher: Ok
[13:46:20] <granden> Dont have firebug though
[13:46:29] <catcher> you can use any dev tools really..
[13:46:31] <granden> but operas dragonfly should be good i think.
[13:46:45] <granden> catcher: Good, thought firebug would have any specific stuffs :)
[13:47:00] <catcher> granden, in other cases yes, but in this case any will do.
[13:48:02] <tw2113> only oldschoolers/hipsters do the jquerys without some sort of inspector tools

[13:49:20] <granden> seaching for it and changing background-color nothing happens :(

[13:49:54] <gnarf> yes please
[13:50:05] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: it's pretty warm there
[13:50:15] * gnarf nods
[13:50:21] <gnarf> my poor AC unit can't keep up
[13:50:30] <gnarf> its like 88 in my office
[13:50:31] <catcher> granden, if you can share a link, we can help you track it down.
[13:50:43] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: working from home is great on those days
[13:51:02] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: thats why my AC unit can't keep up ;)
[13:51:03] <ryanneufeld> less clothes without offending someone
[13:51:19] <ryanneufeld> ?ohyou
[13:51:20] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, 8598 - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 9 days ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8598
[13:51:23] <gnarf> the AC at work is prolly awesome
[13:51:33] <ryanneufeld> ours is damn near arctic
[13:51:35] <granden> catcher: http://actesolutions.se/produktlista.php?id=11 the buttons in the white box.
[13:51:53] <granden> would like to change the active state color to another one so it looks more like they are active, white not so good :)
[13:52:09] <granden> but dont want to effect the slider.
[13:54:17] <gnarf> granden: #con2 .ui-button.ui-state-active { background: #fff; }
[13:55:06] <catcher> granden, .ui-state looks like the one, just keep in mind it's currently an image
[13:55:16] <granden> gnarf: hmm
[13:55:26] <granden> could I put that in my normal css?
[13:56:05] <catcher> granden, probably, but you may have to be more specific than the current rule.  Leading with #con2 as gnarf mentioned should do the trick
[13:56:18] <gnarf> also since you only want buttons
[13:56:26] <gnarf> .ui-button.ui-state-active
[13:56:29] <granden> ok
[13:57:47] <granden> nice, and I would need an image to get that graident those button currently have?
[13:58:41] <catcher> granden, you can get gradient backgrounds in CSS3
[13:58:54] <granden> catcher: So a css3 gradient would work as well. Cool.
[13:59:02] <granden> I colud use that as a temporary solution then.
[13:59:15] <catcher> why not permanent? :)
[13:59:19] <granden> temporary only because I would like support in IE8
[13:59:25] <tubbo`work> granden: look up CSSPIE
[14:00:17] <tubbo`work> it has JS/IE-specific hooks for CSS3 stuff that isn't available in the early IEs (but for which alternative functionality existed)
[14:00:37] <granden> tubbo`work: Ok, cool. Thanks!
[14:01:45] <granden> Now there is only one goddamn problem left, my god damn menu :) Thanks alot for the help with the css guys!
[14:06:20] <john-dev> granden, whats wrong with your menu?
[14:07:34] <d00gie> apparently god damned it to pebcac doom...
[14:08:11] <granden> john-dev: Give it a try, http://actesolutions.se/produktlista.php?id=11
[14:08:16] <granden> it opens and closes.
[14:08:31] <yelvert> anyone know why a scroll event for a ul would not get triggered?
[14:08:54] <john-dev> i dont know whats wrong btw..
[14:09:26] <john-dev> yelvert, a ul is invalid html5 markup btw..
[14:09:40] <tw2113> unordered lists are invalid?
[14:10:08] <yelvert> the ul has a height of 535px and 3000px of content, the overflow is set to auto, but when i scroll the ul the event doesnt get fired
[14:10:21] <granden> $(".class").hasClass("active"); if I got like 5 elements with the class class.
[14:10:24] <yelvert> and no, uls are perfectly valid html5
[14:10:31] <granden> Would that work if any of those have the class active?
[14:10:35] <tw2113> was gonna say
[14:10:38] <granden> without the dot.
[14:10:40] <john-dev> yelvert, ul's are, a ul's arent
[14:11:01] <tw2113> ahhh
[14:11:06] <tw2113> ul's insdie anchors
[14:11:11] <tw2113> inside*
[14:11:24] <john-dev> granden, try $([class^="class"]')..
[14:11:54] <yelvert> its not inside an a
[14:12:23] <john-dev> [23:08:31]  <yelvert> anyone know why a scroll event for a ul would not get triggered? <- ?
[14:12:33] <john-dev> ah, you mean an ul
[14:12:40] <yelvert> yes
[14:12:44] <john-dev> sry about that^^
[14:12:50] <malorie> why doesn't $('bla > div')[3].toggle() work? and what's the correct way to do that?
[14:12:58] <malorie> s/bla/#bla/
[14:13:09] <yelvert> ive tried scroll(fn) and live, but neither work
[14:13:36] <john-dev> dont use live, its deprecated, use on (jquery version 1. dont know and above)
[14:14:09] <john-dev> malorie, do you mena eq(3)?
[14:15:08] <malorie> what's that?
[14:15:34] <john-dev> http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[14:15:53] <john-dev> it's the index number, like a key in php just for jquery
[14:16:11] <malorie> derp
[14:16:13] <malorie> thanks a lot!
[14:16:21] <john-dev> did it work?
[14:16:30] <malorie> yes :-)
[14:16:33] <john-dev> cool =)
[14:16:44] <yelvert> ok so `$(elem).scroll(fn)` doesnt work but `$(elem).get(0).onscroll = fn` does
[14:17:32] <john-dev> yelvert, thats now what i meant with on, i meant .on
[14:18:06] <bakers> If have a string "aabbccddee" what's the best way to split() that into an array every 2 chars?
[14:18:38] <john-dev> bakers, proably a while and modulo division
[14:18:45] <yelvert> well the events get set through delegate
[14:19:03] <john-dev> var $d=0;
[14:19:07] <john-dev> fc sry
[14:19:22] <yelvert> and why does it matter whether its bound with .scroll or .on('scroll'?
[14:20:08] <john-dev> yelvert, .on works for objects created aftter the dom was ready, .scroll only works or objects that did exists before the dom was ready
[14:20:27] <john-dev> sry, .on works for both, of course
[14:21:29] <yelvert> well, which one does delegate use?
[14:21:37] <tw2113> isn't .click() getting phased out?
[14:21:54] <tw2113> eh, disregard that question, it was unrelated to what i was thinking
[14:21:59] <tw2113> *needs more coffee*
[14:22:12] <yelvert> `this.$el.delegate(selector, eventName, method);` <- that is how my events are being bound
[14:22:48] <john-dev> yelvert, sry i cant answer that
[14:23:12] <granden> Still not solved my menu-problem. :(
[14:25:13] <john-dev> granden, $('[class^="class"]') you are probably looking for .each right?
[14:27:20] <yelvert> john-dev: ok, so it looks like delegate uses .on
[14:28:12] <granden> dunno what, I would like to run slideUp on all excepts the one I press on that should be slideDown
[14:28:22] <john-dev> yelvert, nope, .on is the same as .live but .live is deprecated and .on is only available in the newer version (i think 1.7.x >)
[14:28:56] <granden> hmm
[14:28:59] <granden> having like
[14:29:24] <john-dev> ?
[14:29:29] <yelvert> john-dev: im using 1.7.2
[14:29:30] <granden> $(this).next().slideDown("1000", function(){ $(this).addClass()});
[14:29:48] <granden> would that be on $(this) or $(this).next()?
[14:30:09] <john-dev> .on is the trigger, nothing else..
[14:30:29] <yelvert> and the event works correctly if i manually trigger it with `$(elem).scroll()`, but when actually scrolling, nothing happens
[14:30:30] <john-dev> addclass() doesnt make
[14:31:10] <granden> john-dev: It works now, nearly for me
[14:31:15] <granden> my menu
[14:31:17] <yelvert> john-dev: also, the ul is generated after the page is loaded
[14:31:23] <granden> it opens one that it should not open
[14:31:37] <granden> and closes/opens a menu already open.
[14:31:38] <john-dev> yelvert, so .on isn't "needed", but you can use it anyway
[14:32:09] <yelvert> john-dev: and the event is being attached after the elem exists btw
[14:32:34] <tash> stupid IE9, browser complains and when I put in compatibility mode, things works ... any tips for me?
[14:32:52] <yelvert> im not using it, im using backbone views (backbonejs.org) and it uses .delegate for event binding, and .delegate uses .on internally
[14:32:57] <john-dev> tash, show us the erroroutput of ie9 and the code..
[14:33:28] <tash> I can't repro it in my IE9, but the client can ... so, to get the error output, would they need to enable developer tools?
[14:33:41] <john-dev> yelvert, sry i never heared of backbonejs .delegate
[14:33:46] <yelvert> john-dev: the event is getting bound properly and i can manually trigger it, but the browser is not triggering it
[14:33:47] <tash> I can probably get a remove session with them real quick
[14:34:05] <shoky> yelvert it works fine http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/GJaPc/
[14:34:12] <yelvert> john-dev: backbone uses jquery.fn.delegate
[14:34:27] <john-dev> tash, probably
[14:34:49] <tash> john-dev, I'll get a remote session with them and see
[14:34:59] <john-dev> $(elements).delegate(selector, events, data, handler);  // jQuery 1.4.3+
[14:34:59] <john-dev> $(elements).on(events, selector, data, handler);        // jQuery 1.7+
[14:35:02] <john-dev> as i said before =)
[14:35:12] <tash> generally speaking is that usually related to some old html tags and junk?
[14:35:45] <yelvert> delegate: function( selector, types, data, fn ) {
[14:35:45] <yelvert> 		return this.on( types, selector, data, fn );
[14:35:46] <yelvert> 	},
[14:36:01] <yelvert> sry, didnt mean to paste that in here like that
[14:36:23] <yelvert> thats jquery 1.7.2's delegate function
[14:36:41] <shoky> you are in agreement, what's the problem
[14:36:50] <yelvert> it doesnt work
[14:36:53] <shoky> what doesn't?
[14:37:11] <tash> john-dev: unfortunately they have left for the day
[14:37:13] <tash> dang
[14:37:29] <tash> was hoping it was something that is common enough that someone would just know what to look for
[14:37:46] <yelvert> the event doesnt get fired when i scroll, but i can manually trigger the scroll event `$(elem).scroll()` and it works fine
[14:38:19] <yelvert> shoky: and it works in ur example, so i cant figure out what the hell is going on
[14:38:52] <john-dev> yelvert, triggering an event manually is always possible, there would be no differnence between click and focus for example.. try $(elem).on('scoll',function() {...
[14:38:54] <shoky> well, reproduce it in a fiddle then ;p
[14:39:08] <john-dev> yelvert, scroll*
[14:39:23] <john-dev> tash, i dont even know what you are talking about...
[14:39:29] <shoky> $(elem).scroll(fn) is exactly the same as $(elem).on('scroll', fn)
[14:39:53] <yelvert> and neither one works
[14:39:58] <shoky> prove it
[14:39:59] <yelvert> at least for me
[14:40:42] <txt23> Can someone help me please. I can't get my height right in the fancybox: http://goo.gl/ivtt5
[14:40:45] <shoky> maybe you are not binding to the right element..?
[14:41:03] <yelvert> i can manually trigger it and it works though.. thats whats so odd
[14:41:21] <blendedbychris> are there any "hooks" that you might be able to add content to the @media page version of a page with jquery?
[14:41:27] <shoky> yelvert that is not odd at all
[14:41:44] <shoky> manually triggering an event will always .. trigger the event
[14:42:10] <john-dev> yepp, as i said above
[14:42:14] <Ricaz> Anyone know of a simple gallery plugin? Just need to enlarge an image when clicked, and darken the rest of the site.
[14:42:31] <john-dev> Ricaz, fancybox =)
[14:42:37] <Ricaz> john-dev, thanks
[14:42:44] <john-dev> you are welcome
[14:43:13] <txt23> john-dev: Hey! Do you know how to adjust heights in Fancy box? I'm having trouble setting height on this: http://goo.gl/ivtt5
[14:44:25] <john-dev> there is a height property you can use
[14:45:06] <txt23> john-dev: Yea 'height' : auto, right?
[14:45:18] <john-dev> well, auto only works if your content provides the height..
[14:45:51] <john-dev> if it doesnt work, set autoDimensions to false
[14:46:22] <john-dev> dimensions:
[14:46:23] <john-dev> For inline and ajax views, resizes the view to the element recieves. Make sure it has dimensions otherwise this will give unexpected results
[14:47:19] <txt23> john-dev: Ok will try few things out. Thanks man
[14:47:51] <john-dev> txt23, you are welcome
[14:49:26] <Posterdati> please I need help to make galleriffic works in a jquery dialog
[14:49:44] <yelvert> john-dev: shoky
[14:49:55] <john-dev> yelvert, ?
[14:50:08] <yelvert> john-dev, shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/C8Ehz/
[14:50:28] <yelvert> sry my client keeps thinking im hitting enter
[14:51:14] <yelvert> the delegate one, is the one kindof stuck using
[14:51:39] <john-dev> .scroll() works fine here :-/
[14:51:59] <yelvert> yeah, but why do the others not, when they should
[14:53:07] <yelvert> im pretty much stuck using delegate, and its not funtioning correctly for the scroll event, every other event it has handled without fail
[14:53:32] <john-dev> http://jsfiddle.net/mzNxq/ <- here you go
[14:54:26] <yelvert> those dont use delegate though
[14:54:50] <john-dev> well, .delegate does use .on, so thats the problem? i simply dont get it
[14:56:49] <john-dev> maybe i simply dont know what .delegate is used for, or even why you still use it
[14:59:14] <Jon47> delegate is an old api that has been superseded by .on
[14:59:32] <Jon47> it *may* be deprecated in future versions, .on is the future
[15:00:08] <Jon47> .on was introduced in 1.7 i think, sometime in the last year or so
[15:00:29] <john-dev> he quited
[15:00:44] <john-dev> .delegate simply doesnt support a scroll handling =)
[15:10:20] <GreekFreak> I have a container that has overflow hidden, and a button that I wish to expand the container to "auto" when clicked. That .animate() function doesn't take auto as a size value. How do I do this?
[15:11:31] <john-dev> .height()
[15:11:44] <john-dev> try
[15:11:45] <shoky> switching from hidden to auto doesn't expand anything though
[15:11:47] <john-dev> fc
[15:12:25] <shoky> oh unless you mean the scrollbar being added
[15:13:05] <john-dev> $('div').css('height'.$(div).height());
[15:13:39] <john-dev> . = ,
[15:13:44] <GreekFreak> I don't know what the height is cause I've restricted it 150px to have overflow hidden
[15:14:01] <shoky> the height is still 150px then..
[15:14:08] <GreekFreak> exactly
[15:14:16] <shoky> if you want to know the height of the inner content
[15:14:19] <shoky> you need an inner container
[15:14:30] <shoky> the outer one has overflow:hidden
[15:14:33] <shoky> but the inner doesnt
[15:14:42] <shoky> and you dont set its height explicity
[15:14:43] <shoky> l
[15:14:49] <GreekFreak> I've read of 2 solutions. using $.slideDown() or setting oveflow to visible, getting the height, setting it to hidden again, and nimating to the height. Although I don't know if it will flash or not
[15:15:30] <shoky> sec,
[15:15:42] <GreekFreak> shoky, the overflow hidden is on the container I want hidden, and set to 150px
[15:15:57] <john-dev> shoky is right, use the inner divs .height() to expane the outer divs .css('height'
[15:16:44] <GreekFreak> shoky, here, take a look. https://gist.github.com/3056822
[15:17:02] <GreekFreak> hmm let me fiddle with that then
[15:17:43] <GreekFreak> problem is the outer container is a fieldset, and it doesn't take overflow for some reason
[15:18:34] <shoky> GreekFreak sec
[15:19:12] <shoky> GreekFreak: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/rkxFj/
[15:20:42] <GreekFreak> shoky, thanx. I'll try implement that. I had only one container and had overflow hidden to that, cause it was already a container in a fieldsset. So I'll add another and use your method.
[15:20:45] <GreekFreak> Thanx guys
[15:21:02] <shoky> hm tho it doesnt go to the full height in my fiddle
[15:21:59] <GreekFreak> shoky, it did in mine :P
[15:22:14] <shoky> you sure?
[15:22:27] <shoky> i mean, it expands, but it should expand a bit more
[15:22:35] <shoky> not the whole text fits in view
[15:22:51] <john-dev> http://jsfiddle.net/MRgRH/6/
[15:23:31] <john-dev> just build the outer container around the fieldset
[15:23:53] <GreekFreak> john-dev, and hide that one?
[15:24:04] <john-dev> not hide, overflow:hidden it
[15:24:19] <john-dev> well, overflow:hidden the outer div i mean
[15:24:37] <GreekFreak> john-dev, ya, that's what I meant. I'll try it now
[15:24:50] <john-dev> well, it works in js fiddle :-)
[15:24:52] <LoneStar99> can i add to classes to the following -->  $(document).on('keyup', '.class1 .class2', function(event){ ... });
[15:25:00] <LoneStar99> to --> two
[15:25:16] <LoneStar99> is that allowed?
[15:25:22] <john-dev> LoneStar99, seperate the classes by comma ","
[15:25:30] <LoneStar99> oh ok cool
[15:25:32] <LoneStar99> thanks
[15:25:42] <john-dev> but your syntax is wrong
[15:26:17] <LoneStar99> john-dev: my syntax is wrong?
[15:26:28] <john-dev> $('.1, .2').on('keyup', function(event) {...
[15:27:22] <BinaryKitten> john-dev actually his syntax could be completely correct
[15:27:23] <LoneStar99> john-dev:  i think i had the use the $(document). or else it does not bind properly...
[15:27:47] <BinaryKitten> LoneStar99 are those classed items added later than the code is run/
[15:27:49] <BinaryKitten> ?
[15:28:11] <john-dev> BinaryKitten, doesnt matter, he usees .on
[15:28:18] <LoneStar99> BinaryKitten: yeah --> ajax request
[15:28:27] <BinaryKitten> john-dev it does matter
[15:28:31] <BinaryKitten> .on = all events
[15:28:48] <john-dev> added before the dom is ready or later, right
[15:29:01] <BinaryKitten> $(selector).on(event, fn) = bind now
[15:29:07] <LoneStar99> brb have a phone interview
[15:29:26] <BinaryKitten> $(a parent).on(event, 'selector', fn) = bind now for later
[15:29:44] <BinaryKitten> equivelent to pre 1.7 .delegate
[15:29:55] <BinaryKitten> which has now been deprecated
[15:30:32] <LoneStar99> yeah using the lastest here...
[15:30:38] <BinaryKitten> LoneStar99 when you get back from the phone interview
[15:30:50] <BinaryKitten> try to use the direct parent of the items
[15:31:03] <BinaryKitten> eg where they're being injected instead of document
[15:31:11] <GreekFreak> john-dev, it worked. thanx again. you too shoky
[15:31:34] <BinaryKitten> eg <div id="target"><span class="1"></span><span class="2"></span></div>
[15:31:56] <LoneStar99> BinaryKitten: i think i tried direct parent and was a FAIL
[15:32:05] <BinaryKitten> you would do $('#target').on('keyup', '.1, .2', fn
[15:32:15] <BinaryKitten> LoneStar99 keep going 1 up the tree
[15:32:29] <BinaryKitten> document should always be the last last last last resort
[15:32:29] <LoneStar99> BinaryKitten: ok will try after the call
[15:40:47] <squeakita> can someone help me understand this:  http://pastebin.com/kjnffwQ3  Heres what I am trying to do, using this live form validation plugin  http://www.geektantra.com/2009/09/jquery-live-form-validation/ i have 2 buttons on the form, disaqualify and Qualify, if I click Disqualify, I want the for to not validate, but submit, if I click Qualify I want it to validate and submit. So far all is...
[15:40:48] <squeakita> ...working, with one exception.
[15:42:06] <squeakita> if for somereason they click qualify first and there are fails on the validation, the disqualify will no longer work. if I click disqualify first, it works fine.   i am a noob at the jquery - can anyone shed some light or point me in the right direction?
[15:46:48] <xarxer> Is it possible to run .animate() and .toggleClass() in a parallel fashion on an element?
[15:53:11] <Murg|e> http://jsfiddle.net/HtkEe/ To apply jquery to future elements, I think I'm supposed to use .on() but I can't figure out how to use it properly. Any idea where I would add the .on to the function?
[15:56:18] <Jon47> xarxer: what do you mean by "in a parallel fashion"?  one of those is an instantaneous dom modification, the other takes place over a period of time..
[15:58:30] <slajax> anyone using spf13 vim plugin with handlebars?
[16:21:16] <Space-Duck> I'm struggling with setting checkbox attributes: http://jsfiddle.net/TTZng/ Anyone care to offer some assistance?
[16:22:17] <shoky> Murg|e: which elements do you want to handle events for? what event? the click?
[16:22:39] <shoky> also what's "apply jquery" mean
[16:23:48] <Murg|e> @shoky if you look staging.myhyperlinker.com you might get a better idea.
[16:24:19] <Murg|e> If you click the + to add an item, the toggles dont show up. I'm not sure how to explain it.
[16:24:37] <Murg|e> I'll cut out some code to stick in JSFiddle for you.
[16:25:36] <jehe> Am adding this from an external js file to my index.html <input type='text' class='result' value="text"> when I click it I want all of the text to be selected, however... that dont seem to work when its being added to the html through an external script. How can I solve this?
[16:26:09] <shoky> Murg|e: they dont show up because they are not there..
[16:27:40] <jehe> gah, had to add onClick
[16:27:42] <jehe> ugly
[16:28:00] <shoky> Murg|e: .on wont help you here. .on is only for binding event handlers
[16:28:27] <shoky> Murg|e: you need to re-apply the jquery UI methods if you are adding fresh elements to the DOM
[16:28:48] <Murg|e> Exacly, I thought .on() did that, reapply'd to future elements.
[16:28:54] <Murg|e> So what do you suggest.
[16:29:05] <shoky> no, .on only binds event handlers
[16:29:10] <shoky> it doesnt apply anything
[16:29:11] <Murg|e> Ok.
[16:29:17] <shoky> i said what i suggest :P
[16:29:39] <shoky> if you add an element to the DOM that you didn't apply the jquery UI methods on
[16:29:46] <shoky> then you won't see jquery UI applied to them, obviously.
[16:30:04] <Murg|e> So in the ajax success for example, re-execute the specific jquery-ui code that i executed on page load?
[16:30:30] <shoky> yes
[16:30:46] <Murg|e> Alright, i'll give that a shot. Thanks again shoky.
[16:31:07] <shoky> np
[16:32:01] <shoky> of course, i dont know if you really have to replace the whole contents of that container. if its not necessary then it's better to just add one button and apply the jqui stuff just to it
[16:32:02] <Murg|e> One more question, instead of putting in duplicate code, can I name the current function and then call it in the ajax success. I tried that earlier but didnt get it to work.
[16:32:13] <shoky> yeah you can
[16:32:21] <shoky> dont duplicate code :P
[16:33:01] <shoky> umm
[16:33:42] <shoky> nvm
[16:43:27] <Murg|e> Oh, $(function is the same as $(document).ready lol.  So I can remove all the $(function and put all my jquery in a single enclosure.
[16:45:28] <sterlo> I'm using .slider from jQuery UI, I'm hooking into the create event to apply a display element. That element labels the currently selected value. Is there a way I can get the current value of the slider during the create event?
[16:50:02] <ryanneufeld> sterlo: it's not created yet, so how would you get the value?
[16:50:26] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: fair enough.
[16:50:32] <ryanneufeld> sterlo: if you're setting a range, I think you can set the initial value as well (have't checked the docs on this one)
[16:50:47] <ryanneufeld> sterlo: since you define the values, it's pretty easy to get the initial state
[16:50:55] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: I'm adding a label above the data cursor that reflects the current value as it is changed
[16:51:15] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: maybe i'm just adding it too soon...
[16:51:46] <ryanneufeld> sterlo: so, you're using the create event, to make the label?
[16:51:47] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: is there a more appropriate place to do it? a way of saying "look you just created this - NOW do x"
[16:51:56] <ryanneufeld> do you have a demo?
[16:52:02] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: yes - "If a slider is created, show a label above the data-point"
[16:52:04] <sterlo> one sec
[16:52:15] <ryanneufeld> http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#rangemax
[16:52:28] <ryanneufeld> if you look there, it starts with the label
[16:53:02] <ryanneufeld> sterlo: I think what you can do is to use jquery to inject the label, before you instanciate the slider by calling .slider()
[16:55:24] <sterlo> i'm injecting the label INTO the A tag that the slider creates.
[16:55:42] <sterlo> i have a working version - but - i am trying to improve it :P
[16:55:46] <kza> I'm working inside of the wordpress widget drag and drop area, and when I drag my widget to the side bar none of my jquery is working, and I think it's because i'm using .changed(), and i tried .live() even and that didn't work either. I need something that can check the selector to the most recent check of the dom
[16:56:01] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: trying to get you example code without breaking any NDAs :P
[16:56:22] <ryanneufeld> sterlo: wait, you want the label in the slider handle?
[16:56:43] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: the slider handle is just a dot - and the label will follow the handle
[16:56:49] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: part of the design spec i've been given
[16:56:51] <coldhead> PROTECT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES!!!
[16:56:51] <ircjsbot> coldhead, you have one new message, just say read to me when you wish to read it.
[16:57:15] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: like i said - it works - but its not "elegant"
[16:57:32] <ryanneufeld> hmm, I can see how that could be a problem
[16:58:21] <ryanneufeld> a reduced case on jsfiddle would help
[16:58:29] <ryanneufeld> coldhead... howsit
[16:58:51] <coldhead> thank goddess it's friday, ryry
[16:58:57] <coldhead> this week has slaughtered me
[16:59:01] <ryanneufeld> did you make it to the jqconf?
[16:59:06] <coldhead> no sir
[16:59:10] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: here's a VERY ugly version: http://jsbin.com/ovaser
[16:59:10] <ryanneufeld> :(
[16:59:16] <coldhead> you either huh
[16:59:22] <coldhead> well at least we didn't miss each other
[16:59:30] <ryanneufeld> haha
[16:59:32] <ryanneufeld> I made it
[16:59:36] <ryanneufeld> I was there man!
[16:59:42] <coldhead> oh
[16:59:45] <coldhead> goddamn
[16:59:50] <ryanneufeld> indeed
[16:59:57] <coldhead> my displeasure at not making it is increased
[17:00:00] <ryanneufeld> sterlo: I'm looking
[17:00:02] <abjorn> I like how this android ssh app lets you create private/public key pairs but has no way of letting you copy the pubkey or let you scp it to the server you want to connect to.
[17:00:07] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: i appreaciate it
[17:00:10] <abjorn> And by "I like how" I mean "how fucking worthless"
[17:00:15] <sterlo> appreciate event
[17:00:19] <sterlo> bah ! even...
[17:00:49] <ryanneufeld> sterlo: this looks like a fun challenge
[17:01:09] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: yeah - it "works" but i want to make it... pretty lol
[17:01:22] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: code wise - styling wise it looks and works fine :P
[17:01:35] <ryanneufeld> some would disagree
[17:01:41] <ryanneufeld> all that html in a string...
[17:01:42] <ryanneufeld> ew
[17:01:59] <coldhead> bugs first, optimisation later
[17:02:04] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: lol if there's a cleaner way - show me the way - i'm willing to do it better
[17:02:05] <coldhead> fix it fix it fix it, ryry
[17:02:13] <sterlo> coldhead: no more bugs! it works  - just in a very shitty way
[17:02:35] <sterlo> the MAIN issue is that upon document ready - i have to tell the damn thing to set the value to itself...
[17:02:48] <sterlo> which is because at the create event ... i don't have the value.
[17:02:51] <ryanneufeld> sterlo: see when you release is when you see the change happen
[17:03:03] <ryanneufeld> sterlo: gimme 5mins and I'll see what I tell
[17:03:07] <coldhead> can you trigger the "slide" event as soon as it's been created?
[17:03:12] <Bert_2> Hi, I is there any way to know from which version a certain widget was part of jQueryUI, I would like to know in which version Autocomplete was introduced, does anyone know the version or where to look ?
[17:03:13] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: you rock
[17:03:34] <sterlo> coldhead: i tried to trigger .change() ... that didn't work...but let me try slide
[17:05:29] <sterlo> coldhead: I tried changing the code from change() to slide() and then calling .slide() AND .slider().trigger('slide')... <- probably wrong ... alas neither worked.
[17:05:46] <sterlo> coldhead / ryanneufeld - both of you do bring up a good point. I should not use change() - i should use slide()
[17:06:04] <ryanneufeld> sterlo: that's the first thing I changed :P
[17:06:10] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: :P
[17:07:43] <ryanneufeld> sterlo: http://jsbin.com/ovaser/2/edit
[17:07:56] <ryanneufeld> sterlo: that's about the best I can offer
[17:08:02] <ryanneufeld> there might be a better way though
[17:08:22] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: thanks - i'll review
[17:09:47] <ryanneufeld> rev 3 coming soon
[17:10:56] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: you're a stud - that's pretty much the solution i was looking for
[17:11:07] <ryanneufeld> aww shucks
[17:11:24] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: if there's better - keep it coming - but that keeps me from commit JS holocaust by telling the damn thing to set it's value to itself.
[17:11:33] <ryanneufeld> sterlo: what's funny, the ui object in the create context, is empty
[17:11:40] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: I KNOW RIGHT?!
[17:11:47] <ryanneufeld> so using that initValue is kinda  the only way
[17:12:24] <ryanneufeld> sterlo: there
[17:12:24] <ryanneufeld> http://jsbin.com/ovaser/3/edit
[17:13:01] <ryanneufeld> I used jQuery(this) and looked inside that element for the slider controll, which has a class ui-slider-handle
[17:13:16] <ryanneufeld> that way if the markup ever changes the <a> to a <span> it doesn't matter
[17:13:19] <ryanneufeld> it still works
[17:13:42] <ryanneufeld> and you don't have to call the initial change_date function
[17:13:54] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: cooool - yeah that's more futureproof
[17:13:56] <Es0teric> is .animate() only in jquery ui?
[17:13:56] <sterlo> me like
[17:14:36] <ryanneufeld> oh, one more thing you can do... http://jsbin.com/ovaser/4/edit
[17:14:39] <shoky> Es0teric no
[17:14:41] <ryanneufeld> ?animate @ Es0teric
[17:14:42] <bot-t> Es0teric, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[17:14:59] <Es0teric> awesome
[17:15:02] <Es0teric> so i dont need jquery ui then
[17:15:04] <ryanneufeld> sterlo: I gotta run man, but look at how i called your change_date function
[17:15:17] <sterlo> ryanneufeld: ok thanks man
[17:15:25] <ryanneufeld> sterlo: instead of a function calling a function, you have just a function. It's better.
[17:15:28] <ryanneufeld> and smaller
[17:15:32] <ryanneufeld> good luck man.
[17:15:34] <ryanneufeld> I'm outie
[17:15:44] <jehe> its not really a good idea to have extension control using jquery right? On client side. Talking file uploads
[17:15:45] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: catch you later
[17:28:04] <jehe> do jquery have a NOT operator? Like (type != 'jpg')
[17:29:30] <coldhead> ?:not
[17:29:30] <bot-t> :not(selector): Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[17:30:06] <coldhead> .is(':not([type="jpg"])')
[17:30:19] <jehe> or !== ?
[17:30:30] <jehe> when comparing
[17:30:50] <coldhead> you're talking about vanilla JS, right?
[17:30:53] <coldhead> not jQuery
[17:31:06] <coldhead> there is !== and !=, yes
[17:35:26] <jehe> yeah, sorry
[17:41:11] <abjorn> o.o
[17:45:40] <Space-Duck> Is there a better way to do this in jQuery? http://jsfiddle.net/TTZng/
[17:49:05] <andrew9184> is there a quick and easy way to scroll text in a div where the text overflows, but its hidden ?
[17:51:13] <coldhead> andrew9184: <marquee> ?
[17:51:24] <coldhead> there are a lot of marquee plugins
[17:51:33] <coldhead> to recreate that classic effect of yesteryear
[17:51:36] <wolfman2000> Evening. At this point, I've accepted that some jquery libraries have to be paid for. With this in mind, any recommendations for a jQuery powered calendar/event planner? I've looked into dHTMLx, but I found it too cumbersome.
[17:52:32] <andrew9184> ah yeah marquee, that's the magic word
[17:52:32] <coldhead> no one here ever recommnds libs you have to pay for
[17:52:47] <coldhead> that's up the marketing departments
[17:52:53] <andrew9184> well ive used highchart and paid for it before :P
[17:52:55] <coldhead> we love the free here
[17:53:30] <wolfman2000> coldhead: well, know of any good freebies then?
[17:53:48] <coldhead> Space-Duck: i would simplify that code by having ONE function that binds to the click/change events for all checkboxes in that class
[17:53:58] <coldhead> and works out how to set/unset the others based on the one that was clicked
[17:54:06] <coldhead> but that's just me
[17:54:38] <coldhead> i have only worked with this guy, wolfman2000: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[17:57:08] <wolfman2000> coldhead: this is only a piece of the pie, not the whole thing. I'll do some more searching.
[17:57:21] <coldhead> wolfman2000: maybe try githb?
[17:57:24] <coldhead> github*
[17:57:32] <coldhead> you can get a fair idea of what's active/popular
[17:57:35] <coldhead> and worth investigating
[17:57:37] <coldhead> also free :)
[17:57:48] <wolfman2000> I do have a github account myself. Didn't think of trying there.
[18:14:59] <heshanh> hey guys, im trying to select the last div inside an element  where the div class name is not 'last'. i managed to get the all the last divs inside the row by doing this $(".row").children("div:last-child"); how do i filter out the class name
[18:15:42] <rmurphey> ?not @ heshanh
[18:15:43] <bot-t> heshanh, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[18:16:43] <heshanh> i saw .not in the docs but how do i use it
[18:16:47] <heshanh> hang on
[18:17:21] <heshanh> $(".row").children("div:last-child").not('class!=twelvecol'); ?
[18:19:01] <heshanh> that does not filter anything
[18:19:15] <heshanh> i think im not passing the jq in to the .not
[18:19:56] <rmurphey> .not('.twelvecol')
[18:20:14] <rmurphey> if you want to remove items that have a class of twelvecol
[18:20:46] <heshanh> that worked :) thank you
[18:24:25] <coldhead> goddess bless you, mr murphey
[18:39:00] <tash> blah.match(/^\d+$/)  ... can someone good with regex explain what the stuff between the parentheses means?
[18:39:49] <shoky> tash: ^ means start of line, $ means end of line. \d means digit. + means 1 more more of the preceding character(-set)
[18:41:28] <shoky> tash: and of course the /.../ indicate a regexp
[18:42:28] <tash> shoky, thanks ... so that says to allow digits, but what if I want to allow somethin glike 25.25
[18:42:42] <tash> that regexp doesn't allow it
[18:42:44] <shoky> nope
[18:43:00] <shoky> you'd need to be more specific about what you want to allow
[18:43:12] <shoky> (and what not to allow)
[18:43:24] <tash> I want to allow positive numbers and their can be decimal
[18:43:47] <Goopyo> Q: I want to get a json and go through and parse the dates in there, then I want to simply pass it to google charts api as a list/dictionary. Heres what I have: http://jsfiddle.net/qy9rs/
[18:44:03] <tash> not sure that is all that helpful, but essentially I want to be able to enter 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 100, 200, 300 ... etc ... but also 300.25, 90.8, 29.4 and so on as an example
[18:44:37] <shoky> tash: so someth like /^\d+\.?\d*$/
[18:44:39] <tash> as long as I can support adding positive numbers and even a decimal in there that's it
[18:44:55] <tash> ok, let me try to say that in english to see if I have it
[18:45:22] <shoky> actually that'd allow 100.
[18:45:30] <shoky> donno if you want that
[18:46:07] <Space-Duck> coldhead, I took your advice and came up with the following.
[18:46:09] <tash>  / starts the regexp, ^ starts the line, \d says digit, + says any number of digits, \. probably allows a decimal, ? ( does that mean followed by ? ), \d digit, * any digit ?
[18:46:20] <shoky> /^\d+(\.\d+)?$/ or smth i guess. my regex-fu is rusty
[18:46:25] <Space-Duck> Can this be written more efficiently: http://jsfiddle.net/TTZng/2/
[18:46:37] <tash> not sure if I guess correctly, but if you wouldn't mind helping me clear that up that'd rock ... doing something like 100. is probably acceptable fwiw
[18:46:43] <shoky> tash: + doesnt say any number of digits
[18:46:46] <Goopyo> i.e does everything relating to json response have to be within the callback?
[18:47:19] <tash> shoky: yeah, I just scrolled up and read your original response about +
[18:47:20] <tash> sorry
[18:47:28] <tash> I'm going to try that regexp and see what happens.
[18:47:29] <shoky> tash:  \d+ means 1 or more digit.   \.?  means 0 or 1 dot.  \d*  means 0 or more digits
[18:48:23] <coldhead> Space-Duck: http://jsfiddle.net/TTZng/4/
[18:48:30] <tash> shoky: so, the question mark means 0 or 1?
[18:48:33] <coldhead> you can just use .is('#some_id')
[18:48:42] <coldhead> instead of .attr('id') === 'some_id'
[18:48:43] <shoky> tash: yes.  http://www.cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/
[18:48:48] <coldhead> AND you don't need all those each()s
[18:49:01] <coldhead> you can run removeClass() etc. on the entire chain
[18:49:16] <tash> shoky: thanks for that link
[18:49:19] <coldhead> there are probably other optimisations but i'm getting jumped on to do work work >: |
[18:50:53] <shoky> Goopyo: $.getJSON doesn't return the JSON. ajax is asynchronous
[18:51:15] <Goopyo> yeah I got it
[18:51:17] <Goopyo> thanks
[18:54:53] <tash> shoky, btw that worked
[18:54:56] <tash> thanks a ton for that!
[18:55:10] <shoky> np
[18:55:22] <Goopyo> shoky: question for ya
[18:56:02] <Goopyo> Date.parse(string) returns a timestamp, I want a datetime object so I did > new Date(Date.parse(string)); which works. Is that the best way?
[18:57:57] <shoky> Goopyo: i think you can just do new Date(string)
[18:59:07] <Goopyo> that worked thanks!
[18:59:22] <shoky> ;p
[19:02:29] <coldhead> good old date
[19:05:35] <bencahill> Is there a function or something to get an array from one attribute from each of the elements in a jQuery object, or do I have to do .each() ?
[19:07:28] <bencahill> Ooh, maybe .data() /
[19:07:31] <bencahill> ?*
[19:09:04] <bencahill> Or not...
[19:10:39] <bencahill> It looks like .map is what I need.
[19:11:50] <bencahill> Yeah, that worked. Great!
[19:20:08] <abjorn> coldhead: SUP MY BRUTHA
[19:21:17] <coldhead> loving on $.fn.timeago, abjsy
[19:21:32] <coldhead> nice little lib
[19:35:34] <quickq> uhm hi anybody there?
[19:36:05] <quickq> I had a quick Q regarding: the syntax : variable = $('<div />', { text : $this.attr('title')} <- what does this even do?
[19:36:48] <coldhead> it creates a div and sets the text to whatever $this.attr('title') returns
[19:37:08] <quickq> that creates a div? not select for it?
[19:37:28] <quickq> also do you bychance have the jquery doc for that?
[19:37:32] <coldhead> selectors select
[19:37:37] <coldhead> <html> creates html
[19:37:39] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery2
[19:37:59] <coldhead> the signature with "props" is what you're seeing
[19:38:25] <coldhead> its a beautiful thing
[19:38:31] <quickq> much appreciated coldhead
[19:38:41] <coldhead> you are very welcome! please enjoy
[19:38:42] <quickq> thanks :D
[19:42:50] <krz> whats wrong with this: $('#now_playing ul').load('/songs?category=recent #now_playing li');
[19:43:54] <krz> ok nvm
[19:52:46] <coldhead> good job everyone, take five
[20:02:34] <quickq> hi quick question, can i bind ajaxstart and ajaxstop to an object?
[20:02:38] <quickq> sorry
[20:02:41] <quickq> let me rethink my question
[20:09:37] <geoff__> still rethinking?
[20:09:49] <quickq> yea
[20:12:24] <coldhead> She said you'll get me when I'm old and wizened / And not a day before that / The devil said honey it won't be that long / Besides I like to see a little more fat / Yeah I like to see a little more fat
[20:14:53] <jiu> Can anyone help me with a problem in append function?
[20:16:15] <cristianocd> what's the problem?
[20:17:53] <jiu> I append an anchor to a div..but got no result
[20:18:12] <coldhead> may we see the code you are using?
[20:18:28] <jiu> Let me find the code..im in my phone right now
[20:18:49] <coldhead> have we caught you at a bad time?
[20:18:52] <coldhead> we can call back later
[20:18:54] <coldhead> sup tintin
[20:18:56] <tintin> coldhead: hi
[20:19:04] <tintin> coldhead: Are you this channel operator?
[20:19:15] <cristianocd> lol
[20:19:51] <coldhead> no tintin
[20:19:58] <coldhead> i'm just some guy
[20:20:07] <Milos|Work> ChanServ is, duh :P
[20:20:08] <jiu> Btw is cool to know theres a channel for jquery
[20:20:24] <jiu> Ill live here from now on
[20:20:41] <coldhead> there aren't really proper operators here, it's more of a free love commune with anarcho-syndicalist principles
[20:20:56] <coldhead> come see my articles etc
[20:22:00] <tintin> Should i move to use mootools from jquery?
[20:22:11] <abjorn> coldhead: You should make a javascript framework, they seem to be allthefuckingrage these days
[20:22:16] <coldhead> there's a bigger audience to troll here, tintin
[20:22:21] <coldhead> so yes, probably
[20:22:44] <coldhead> i wouldn't know where to start, abjorn ! but i agree, we need more
[20:23:09] <cristianocd> i'm using angular.js end really enjoying it
[20:23:13] <abjorn> I know, I just love learning new frameworks to determine their worth, only to toss them aside because I don't like them.
[20:23:14] <cristianocd> and*
[20:23:21] <abjorn> it's like, a new one every week
[20:24:56] <abjorn> I use backbone.js at work...it's kind of a pain at first, really. It's like...it wants to give you structure...and then it says "ah, fuck it, this is enough"
[20:24:57] <coldhead> and you'd like to move to 2 a week, abjorn ?
[20:25:03] <abjorn> oh yes of course
[20:25:28] <abjorn> anyways, im off to the movies
[20:25:30] <abjorn> bbl
[20:25:37] <coldhead> have fun bb
[20:25:39] <tintin> How many javascript library/apis are there? today this comes tomorrow another one comes
[20:25:45] <tintin> So which one to use or choose?
[20:25:58] <coldhead> whichever one you have the most fun with, tintin
[20:26:03] <tintin> What about using regular/plain javascript instead of any javascript library/api ?
[20:26:15] <coldhead> if that's more fun for you, by all means
[20:26:40] <tintin> today or tomorrow new library/apis comes with new features , so then will you move to that new one
[20:26:50] <tintin> And after some years move for another one?
[20:27:13] <coldhead> i hope i am dead before then
[20:27:18] <tintin> So what about using regular/plain javascript instead of any javascript library/api to avoid these jumpin/moving from this to that?
[20:27:19] <coldhead> but jQuery is paying the bills for now
[20:27:39] <tintin> coldhead: jquery is paying the bills? how? what do you mean?
[20:27:47] <coldhead> if you want to learn one thing and only one thing then learn JS 1.2 and stick with that
[20:27:57] <coldhead> i mean i get paid to use jQuery now
[20:28:01] <coldhead> and it's working out for me
[20:28:50] <jiu> Can i upload a file here?
[20:29:16] <coldhead> not usefully, jiu
[20:29:35] <abjorn> I may have spoken too soon, waiting for my ride...
[20:29:36] <coldhead> ?p @ jiu
[20:29:36] <bot-t> jiu, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[20:29:43] <jiu> Ill try to paste my code here
[20:29:44] <abjorn> what a coincidence, jQuery pays for my bills too
[20:29:53] <abjorn> as well as backbone, html, css, and general javascript badassery
[20:30:08] <coldhead> abjorn: there was a talk at txjs about how ember.js provides the sane defaults and framework that backbone doesn't
[20:30:17] <coldhead> in an additional 15 MB of code or something
[20:30:57] <abjorn> lol
[20:31:01] <abjorn> OKAY NOW MY RIDE IS HERE LATER
[20:31:19] <coldhead> have fun bb
[20:32:23] <jiu> http://jsfiddle.net/SRt7z/
[20:32:34] <jiu> Here is my code
[20:33:15] <jiu> I got problem when i do the html..i try with append too..but cant make it work
[20:33:43] <jiu> Simply doesn append the anchor
[20:35:02] <rodd> anyone using sublime text 2 knows if the "trial" version is limited in features?
[20:36:01] <coldhead> jiu: it may be that the element you are trying to append to does not exist
[20:36:09] <coldhead> or you may be appending invalid HTML
[20:36:27] <coldhead> jiu: it's good to try running this code line by line at the JS console
[20:36:32] <coldhead> and see where it craps out
[20:36:42] <cristianocd> ./quit !
[20:36:55] <jiu> I get it
[20:37:30] <jiu> With chrome console i see the anchor and it looks just fine
[20:37:38] <jiu> Its weird
[20:38:23] <coldhead> is your code wrapped in .ready() ?
[20:39:10] <jiu> Actually if i append the result of the code that the console give it does the job
[20:40:18] <jiu> Now that you mentioned ..nope..its not in ready fn
[20:41:16] <coldhead> we may have solved your problem
[20:41:21] <coldhead> great job everyone, take 5
[20:41:31] <jiu> Yeah you did
[20:41:39] <jiu> Thanks man
[20:42:19] <jiu> Im guessing thats the.problem..ill try it 2morrow
[20:45:47] <jiu> One other question..anyone have samples of tree grid using xml to provide please?
[20:46:30] <quickq> is there a way I can use jquery to hook onto ajax's .complete?
[20:46:41] <ndss56> what jquery is used to change text in <button class="myButt">Text</button>
[20:47:03] <jiu> In trirand the samples are made with json
[20:47:03] <quickq> I wish to have an ajax passed into my function, fire out the ajax, and have a callback that calls after the .complete is done
[20:48:13] <coldhead> ?ajaxcomplete @ quickq
[20:48:13] <bot-t> quickq, .ajaxComplete(handler): Register a handler to be called when Ajax requests complete. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[20:48:18] <coldhead> does that not do what you want?
[20:48:27] <quickq> ^ thanks bot-t!
[20:48:29] <jiu> $(.myButt).text(asd)
[20:48:33] <quickq> thanks coldhead
[20:48:36] <quickq> :D
[20:48:43] <quickq> much appreciated folks
[20:50:28] <jiu> @coldhead any sample of tree grid man?
[20:50:39] <quickq> what is a tree grid
[20:51:17] <jiu> Its a type of grid of jqgrid plugin
[20:51:20] <coldhead> i don't do that stuff sorry jiu
[20:51:38] <jiu> Ok..thanks anyway
[20:55:52] <jiu> Good night guys..thanks for the help
[20:55:57] <templaedhel> Can someone link me to a writeup or explanation of the cavets of running JS in an iframe? Specifcally making ajax calls and the cross domain implications.
[20:59:53] <coldhead> templaedhel: i suppose it's no use to tell you "DEAR GOD DON'T EVEN TRY"
[20:59:56] <coldhead> which is my approach
[20:59:58] <coldhead> i'm sorry
[21:00:52] <templaedhel> coldhead We have a partner signup form, uses ajax to post to our servers, one partner wants a whitelabel solution they can host sans all the branding (including the domain name)
[21:00:58] <templaedhel> So, iframes came up
[21:01:45] <templaedhel> Are you saying it is not possible to post back to the server hosting the iframe?
[21:01:47] <coldhead> oh i feel ya
[21:01:51] <coldhead> no it's possible
[21:01:55] <ndss56> coldhead: you know why the <img> tag dissapears in my test case, see http://jsfiddle.net/pkAm3/
[21:01:57] <coldhead> it's just a world of pain
[21:02:43] <templaedhel> Yea. Any idea what happens when a form in an iframe gets submitted? No JS
[21:02:46] <coldhead> ndss56: because .text() replaces EVERYTHING inside <button>
[21:02:52] <templaedhel> does the whole parent page redirect?
[21:02:58] <ndss56> coldhead: Ahhh
[21:03:02] <coldhead> you have to wrap the text in a tag and target just that
[21:03:19] <coldhead> or you can use the native .innerText, possibly
[21:03:21] <coldhead> i've never tried
[21:03:27] <coldhead> ?mdc innertext @ ndss56
[21:03:31] <bot-t> ndss56, Node.textContent - MDN - Gets or sets the text content of a node and its descendants. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Node.textContent
[21:03:36] <templaedhel> innertext gets nasty
[21:03:46] <coldhead> that's why i dont touch it
[21:03:48] <coldhead> i fear the nasty
[21:04:15] <ndss56> coldhead: cheers bro.
[21:05:18] <ndss56> coldhead: might be easier to just copy the <img> and add it back.
[21:06:40] <ndss56> maybe not
[21:09:13] <ndss56> how to convert an jquery object to a text?
[21:09:56] <ruby_on_tails> ndss56: text in what sense ?
[21:09:59] <ruby_on_tails> the html of it ?
[21:10:09] <ruby_on_tails> or the dom element ?
[21:10:16] <ndss56> http://jsfiddle.net/pkAm3/1/
[21:10:22] <ndss56> <-- in that sense
[21:10:29] <ndss56> tried $img[0]
[21:10:32] <ndss56> no go.
[21:11:04] <ndss56> ruby_on_tails: yeah i suppose the html of it
[21:13:00] <ruby_on_tails> ndss56: what should be the text in that button when i click it ?
[21:13:24] <ndss56> ruby_on_tails: the img and the text that says "clicked'
[21:13:44] <thomedy> what up everyone
[21:14:02] <ruby_on_tails> ndss56: the image is already there inside the button element
[21:14:08] <ndss56> ruby_on_tails: because im using .text() it replaces the img
[21:14:11] <ruby_on_tails> i am not sure if you can display images inside buttons
[21:14:15] <ndss56> ruby_on_tails: click it and see
[21:14:32] <ndss56> ruby_on_tails: yeah you can display images in buttons
[21:14:58] <ruby_on_tails> but because the image is already there inside the button why doesnt it display by default ?
[21:16:08] <ndss56> ruby_on_tails: the image placeholder dissapears when you click on the button.
[21:16:19] <ruby_on_tails> but by default the image doesnt show up to me
[21:16:30] <ruby_on_tails> it just shows 'Unclicked'
[21:16:41] <ndss56> ruby_on_tails: thats because the src is a rubbish url
[21:16:56] <ruby_on_tails> aah, such an idiotic question i asked, sorry
[21:17:08] <ndss56> ruby_on_tails: exactly! :D
[21:17:48] <ruby_on_tails> http://jsfiddle.net/pkAm3/3/ no use :(
[21:17:49] <ndss56> ruby_on_tails: anyway, trying to add the <img> tag back in after its clicked because .text replaces everything/
[21:18:21] <ndss56> cmon where are the pros when you need them :)
[21:20:30] <ndss56> basically how to convert a jquery object into a HTML string
[21:20:37] <ruby_on_tails> http://jsfiddle.net/pkAm3/4/ i think you need something like this
[21:20:48] <ruby_on_tails> but the image is not working for me
[21:22:42] <ndss56> ruby_on_tails: yeh don't think the button should have the src url on it.
[21:22:58] <ruby_on_tails> i am not sure how images in button works
[21:26:32] <Cork> ndss56: http://api.jquery.com/html/
[21:27:13] <ndss56> Cork: doesnt work because it gives <img ....> instead of <img.... />
[21:27:36] <Cork> ndss56: ya, cause thats valid for img
[21:27:53] <Cork> unless your page is mimetype application/xhtml+xml
[21:28:06] <Cork> (that barely anyone uses)
[21:28:20] <ndss56> Cork: then i would need a closing tag
[21:28:21] <Cork> the /> is just error corrected in text/html
[21:28:29] <Cork> ndss56: no
[21:28:47] <Cork> ndss56: close tags isn't valid for img tags
[21:29:06] <ndss56> Cork: i can just do <img...>
[21:29:11] <Cork> yes
[21:29:16] <Cork> thats how you do html
[21:29:20] <Cork> its not xml
[21:29:47] <Cork> xhtml is another matter, but then you MUST use the xhtml mimetype
[21:30:54] <ndss56> Cork: doesn't look right, see http://jsfiddle.net/pkAm3/5/
[21:31:22] <Cork> git it is
[21:31:24] <Cork> *but
[21:31:55] <Cork> write it and send it through a w3c validation if you like :)
[21:33:26] <ndss56> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/pkAm3/6/
[21:33:43] <ndss56> Cork: click the button and it shows the src in the button O_o
[21:34:22] <Cork> ok, lets back up a bit
[21:34:26] <Cork> what is it you want to do?
[21:34:49] <tw2113> star on broadway?
[21:35:07] <Cork> ndss56: that code as its written does exactly what i would expect it to do
[21:35:20] <Cork> so the question is what your trying to do
[21:36:05] <ndss56> Cork: trying to add the img tag that is removed when i used .text() on click.
[21:36:31] <Cork> so use html?
[21:36:44] <Cork> or even better, don't serialize your dom
[21:38:05] <ndss56> Cork: so clicking on button changes "unclick" to "click"
[21:38:36] <ndss56> Cork: but the img tag is not there anymore
[21:38:47] <Cork> ndss56: can you modify the html structure?
[21:38:57] <Cork> (add an additional element)
[21:39:04] <ndss56> Cork: show me what html structure you have in mind.
[21:39:57] <Cork> ndss56: http://jsfiddle.net/pkAm3/7/
[21:40:05] <Cork> bind...
[21:40:10] <Cork> sorry about that
[21:40:17] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/pkAm3/9/
[21:42:03] <ndss56> Cork: nope can't change html structure
[21:42:13] <Cork> that sucks
[21:42:19] <ndss56> Cork: must be another way.
[21:42:38] <Cork> yes, you need to serialize the content (and that sucks)
[21:42:54] <ndss56> Cork: nope, there another way
[21:44:46] <Cork> ndss56: http://jsfiddle.net/pkAm3/10/
[21:44:59] <Cork> opps missed a check
[21:45:16] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/pkAm3/11/
[21:46:55] <ndss56> Cork: Not bad at all.
[21:47:24] <ndss56> Cork: I was thinking of rebuilding the html by capturing the src url.
[21:47:38] <ndss56> Cork: Yours seems better,
[21:57:38] <quickq> hi i have a quick question... regarding .ajaxcomplete(), i'm trying to place that within the init of a javscript object. However, when calling some ajax calls (and resolving), my handler doesn't seem to be called at all, any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/N7PJy/5/
[21:59:41] <Cork> quickq: you never call the init function
[21:59:47] <raj> I have an array of associative arrays that contain an 'id_num' key. I want to run a function on each $('#container>.item') that has .data('item_info')['id_num']
[21:59:53] <quickq> shit, thanks Cork
[22:01:10] <raj> oops
[22:01:23] <raj> I want to run that function on the matching id_num key
[22:02:28] <Cork> raj: $('#container>.item').filter(function() { var self = $(this) return self.hasData('item_info') && self.data('item_info').id_rum === 10; });
[22:02:30] <raj> I have an array of associative arrays that contain an 'id_num' key. I want to run a function on each $('#container>.item') that has .data('item_info')['id_num'] matching the associative array
[22:02:37] <Cork> * raj: $('#container>.item').filter(function() { var self = $(this); return self.hasData('item_info') && self.data('item_info').id_rum === 10; });
[22:04:08] <raj> Cork, but I want to make that .item add a particular class depending on other stuff in that particular associative array
[22:04:23] <Cork> ok?
[22:04:29] <Cork> so run an each on them then
[22:05:11] <raj> ok, so that was my question, in fact, whether filter alone would be fine, or do I need .each along with it
[22:05:32] <Cork> * raj: $('#container>.item').each(function(elm) { var self = $(elm); if(!self.hasData('item_info') || self.data('item_info').id_rum !== 10) { return }; /*do your thing */ });
[22:05:39] <Cork> raj: don't use both
[22:05:59] <Cork> if your going to modify each one depending on the value in them, do it in one loop
[22:06:02] <Cork> no need for two
[22:06:27] <quickq> could you please take a look at this again now? http://jsfiddle.net/N7PJy/11/, I have updated it so that the .ajaxComplete is called, however it's giving me an error saying "Uncaught TypeError: Object function (a,b){return new e.fn.init(a,b,h)} has no method 'ajaxComplete' "
[22:08:29] <raj> Cork, but I need to get that id_num from the associative array, so it's like I need two each's, no?
[22:08:54] <Cork> quickq: ajaxComplete is ran on a selector, not the jquery object
[22:09:23] <Cork> raj: why?
[22:09:49] <Cork> raj: could you please provide what your talking about
[22:09:54] <raj> sure
[22:10:29] <Cork> quickq: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[22:11:49] <quickq> So Cork, can I not register .ajaxComplete on $ itself?
[22:11:57] <Cork> no
[22:12:04] <Es0teric> dude... typecasting from bootstrap is WAYYY better
[22:12:27] <Es0teric> whoops
[22:12:34] <Es0teric> i mean typeahead
[22:13:49] <shoky> dumdedum
[22:21:59] <quickq> what is the best way to create a dummy jquery object for usage of .ajaxcomplete?
[22:23:27] <Cork> ajaxComplete is an event listener, so you need to bind it on something that it can reference
[22:23:41] <Cork> ex $(document).ajaxComplete();
[22:25:09] <quickq> thank you cork you've been an awesome help
[22:27:42] <raj> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/cpHG2/1/
[22:29:36] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/cpHG2/2/
[22:29:38] <Cork> raj: i would generate an id_num reference array
[22:30:20] <Cork> var id_nums = $.map(myarray, function(elm) { return elm.id_num; });
[22:30:31] <Cork> then search that one, and use its index to look up the object
[22:30:44] <Cork> else you would have to loop silly amount of times
[22:31:07] <raj> ya, I was trying to avoid that
[22:31:14] <raj> (the silly looping)
[22:32:45] <raj> hmm, I'm not sure what's supposed to happen with the mapping?
[22:32:52] <raj> it's currently in an array anyway
[22:33:19] <raj> how does taking it out of the associative array within the array help?
[22:33:49] <granden> http://pastebin.com/VGytcxiN - anyone who can spot my problem? For some reason that just returns, Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[22:34:26] <coldhead> ?jshint @ granden
[22:34:26] <bot-t> granden, http://jshint.com/
[22:34:34] <coldhead> run your code through there
[22:35:04] <Cork> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/cpHG2/3/
[22:35:30] <Cork> raj: sorry thats wrong
[22:35:35] <Cork> one sec
[22:36:04] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/cpHG2/4/
[22:36:59] <granden> Cork: Did not help me acctually,
[22:37:06] <granden> dont get the problem still.
[22:37:41] <Cork> granden: uh, what?
[22:37:50] <granden> Cork: Sorry
[22:37:53] <granden> Wrong highlight
[22:38:25] <Cork> your doing exact string match
[22:38:33] <Cork> and that sounds like a REALLY bad idea
[22:38:47] <granden> Ok
[22:38:57] <granden> What should I do then?
[22:39:22] <coldhead> granden: jshint correctly identifies that you have nested quotes "<div class="bgfix"></div> "
[22:39:27] <Cork> why don't you just do $(this).find('.bgfix').length > 0 ?
[22:39:29] <coldhead> change one of those pairs to single quotes
[22:39:36] <coldhead> or escape the inner ones
[22:39:53] <granden> coldhead: Oh, then I missunderstood jshint.
[22:40:24] <coldhead> granden: it's a good tool, you should embrace it
[22:40:33] <coldhead> much better at spotting errors than puny humans
[22:41:04] <Cork> but just changing the quotes won't fix this problem though
[22:41:17] <granden> coldhead: Hmm I could try that.
[22:41:53] <granden> Damn autocomplete
[22:42:09] <granden> Cork: Tried that, it sort of worked.
[22:42:16] <Cork> sort of?
[22:42:26] <Cork> either it did or it didn't :)
[22:42:50] <granden> it does not match correctly
[22:42:58] <granden> but the code dont gives any errors.
[22:43:07] <Cork> ok, so whats the criteria you need to match then?
[22:43:30] <Cork> the it only has that element and nothing else?
[22:44:21] <granden> I want to match if the child element bgfix has any content, lik <div class="bgfix"></div> then hide that $(this) for content
[22:44:37] <Cork> ah
[22:44:43] <granden> <div class="bgfix">Link 1</div> - This should not hide the content-div.
[22:44:56] <granden> content = $("#accordion .AccordionContent");
[22:45:19] <Cork> so $(this).find('.bgfix:empty').length > 0 ?
[22:45:51] <granden> hmm, :empty checks if the class .bgfix element has anything?
[22:45:57] <Cork> yes
[22:46:05] <granden> why do I need .length>0 then?
[22:46:09] <Cork> yes
[22:46:13] <Cork> cause its a filter
[22:46:17] <granden> ok
[22:46:24] <Cork> so it will return the matched elements
[22:49:43] <granden> Cork: Thanks that worked. Only way I thought of solving my problem, makeing a static menu instead of a dynamic :(
[22:49:58] <granden> tried to make an accordion menu. But it did not turn out so good.
[22:51:20] <coldhead> accordions are hard
[22:52:23] <tw2113> and if you squeeze them right, they make awful noise
[22:55:41] <coldhead> just like kittens
[22:58:19] <coldhead> i miss you Davey
[23:11:21] <coldhead> unable to make sense of her magic
[23:12:11] <quickq> could someone please take a look into http://jsfiddle.net/N7PJy/16/?, the main issue is 1. ajaxComplete is not being fired, and 2. having issues with timeout (recursive)
[23:13:44] <shoky> quickq: im too tired to really go through it, but
[23:13:49] <shoky> var x = $("wtf");
[23:13:57] <shoky> sticks out :P
[23:14:35] <quickq> shoky
[23:14:42] <quickq> thanks you solved #1
[23:14:42] <quickq> :D
[23:14:50] <shoky> ;]
[23:14:58] <shoky> gnight
[23:19:33] <quickq> another quick Q, using this.variable vs this.data('variable'), when to use which?

[23:34:03] <abjorn> especially from brits
[23:34:27] <BinaryKitten> oh please, just because he's australian and he may get it all the time doesn't make it right
[23:34:49] <BinaryKitten> if everyone threw insults at you, it wouldn't be right
[23:35:02] <coldhead> in his defense, BK, i am a pothead, and as such, a criminal
[23:35:16] <coldhead> also i torrented something once
[23:35:27] <BinaryKitten> oh dear gosh coldhead
[23:35:33] <coldhead> so far as penal colonies go, abjorn, it's better than siberia
[23:35:38] <abjorn> rofl
[23:35:38] <BinaryKitten> i would never have expected something like that from you
[23:35:49] <coldhead> based on looking out the window of a plane flyng over siberia
[23:36:04] <abjorn> what's the world if people from different countries can't make fun of each other?
[23:36:08] <abjorn> boring, that's what
[23:36:37] <BinaryKitten> making fun starts wars
[23:36:47] <coldhead> on the one hand, abjorn: fair enough. on the other hand: don't mess with BK
[23:36:49] <BinaryKitten> seen it too many times already in my life time
[23:36:51] <abjorn> Well, no, not really, having something someone wants or killing someone important does.
[23:37:06] <abjorn> ANYWAYS
[23:37:14] <abjorn> HOW GOES THE QWERIES
[23:37:22] <coldhead> what if i ruminated on my criminal ways and ended up taking my own life tonight, abjorn
[23:37:25] <BinaryKitten> $('#conversation').switch('#newtopic')
[23:37:31] <coldhead> who would fill the vital role of whatever it is i do all day
[23:37:34] <abjorn> well
[23:37:37] <abjorn> first I would feel sad
[23:37:37] <coldhead> ROBOTS
[23:37:41] <juha_> anybody know why jquery mobile gives .ui-mobile body element height of 99.9% and not 100% ?
[23:37:42] <abjorn> then I would be like "wtf really coldhead?"
[23:37:46] <abjorn> then id feel sad again
[23:37:55] <coldhead> i used to know, juha_ !
[23:38:07] <abjorn> it's a CSS hack that I always fucking forget
[23:38:07] <coldhead> its in a comment in the CSS or something
[23:38:19] <abjorn> it's hard to remember all them CSS hacks
[23:38:21] <abjorn> there's just so many
[23:38:23] <BinaryKitten> scrollbars?
[23:38:37] <abjorn> mostly because CSS is wack, yo
[23:38:40] <abjorn> YEAH I SAID IT
[23:38:41] <abjorn> CSS IS WACK
[23:38:49] <BinaryKitten> better than tables though
[23:38:51] <abjorn> SHIT JUST GOT REAL
[23:39:17] * BinaryKitten wonders . o O ( when was it ever not real )
[23:39:45] <abjorn> yo i keeps it real
[23:39:57] * abjorn wiggles
[23:40:17] <BinaryKitten> well then better not kick your ass from here to next week otherwise we'll spend a week without things being real
[23:40:18] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky that he's not here to wiggle and keeps it real with me
[23:40:18] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[23:40:23] <BinaryKitten> that would be scary
[23:40:42] <juha_> coldhead: useful comment: /* some unsets - more probably needed */
[23:40:51] <abjorn> I GET IT NOW
[23:40:57] <abjorn> revelation
[23:41:01] <coldhead> -_-
[23:42:00] <kurrata> i have 'this'that looks something like this. <div><label></label><something></something></div>. how could i give value to label if i have only this ellement. something like this $('this > label').html(id);
[23:42:41] <abjorn> $(this).find("label").html(blablabla);
[23:43:06] <abjorn> or .children(), dealers choice
[23:43:21] <kurrata> thanks, will reab both of them
[23:43:26] <kurrata> read*
[23:43:46] <abjorn> no probs
[23:49:29] <hemangpatel> hello guys
[23:49:46] <coldhead> hemangpatel, my dear fellow
[23:50:30] <hemangpatel> coladhead : i submit the form using setTimeout("$('#form').submit()",1000);
[23:50:52] <coldhead> don't do that
[23:51:05] <hemangpatel> coldhead : why ?
[23:51:13] <coldhead> setTimeout(function () { $('#form').submit(); }, 1000);
[23:51:29] <hemangpatel> whats the diffrence ?
[23:51:31] <coldhead> if you do it as a string it uses eval and things fall apart
[23:51:44] <coldhead> anonymous functions are the joy of javascript
[23:52:07] <Cork> ya, sending strings for parsing results in scopes getting lost and what not
[23:52:11] <coldhead> you will attract better sexual partners with functions
[23:52:14] <Cork> its.... yucky
[23:52:40] <abjorn> all becomes into scope of global
[23:52:40] <hemangpatel> coldhead : i want to put loader image between after page submit .. is it possible ?
[23:53:13] <abjorn> between after...well, it might be possible if "between after" was a thing
[23:53:23] <hemangpatel> after
[23:53:55] <Cork> hemangpatel: your using normal straight http submit?
[23:53:55] <abjorn> I know, I'm just being a dick lol well there's always a way to do stuff. So you're trying to submit a form and put a loader image while it's submitting?
[23:54:19] <abjorn> You'll need to submit the form behind the scenes, using AJAX, otherwise it will do a new page load and you won't be able to put some loading image.
[23:54:27] <Cork> no
[23:54:28] <hemangpatel> yes... when other page load it will disappear.
[23:54:35] <coldhead> hemangpatel: are you sure you don't want to submit via AJAX?
[23:54:43] <coldhead> that's usually what people want
[23:54:48] <coldhead> its the future, today
[23:54:56] <Cork> hemangpatel: you need to make sure you have the image cached, as new requests won't be done when the page is about to unloaded
[23:55:01] <coldhead> non-AJAX is from the between after time
[23:55:15] <Cork> if you do that and show the image before you submit it should work fine
[23:55:41] <hemangpatel> how to do simple ajax form submit..?
[23:55:43] <abjorn> it's not going to be shown long enough for it to matter, then, Cork
[23:55:47] <abjorn> if at all
[23:56:03] <Cork> abjorn: that depends how long it takes for the server to respond
[23:56:08] <abjorn> Well, that's another beast entirely, hemangpatel. Are you familiar with making AJAX calls?
[23:56:08] <Cork> but ya
[23:56:36] <hemangpatel> yes i know all ajax,url,data..  :)
[23:56:54] <abjorn> hemangpatel: The idea is that you grab all the form information and send that data to the server with an ajax call, then do something with the result.
[23:57:10] <abjorn> It's about as simple as any other AJAX call, you just serialize the form in some way.
[23:57:11] <coldhead> hemangpatel: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[23:57:15] <abjorn> or use that
[23:57:34] <abjorn> I DO IT THE OLD FASHIONED WAY
[23:57:44] <Cork> so $('#form').submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); $.post($('#form').prop('action'), $('#form').serialize()); });
[23:57:52] <Cork> that should get you going :)
[23:58:23] <abjorn> Why .prop? Why not .attr? Eh, whatever, doesn't matter.
[23:58:54] <Cork> i usually use prop if i don't explicitly want the unparsed data
[23:58:54] <BinaryKitten> abjorn the 2 got split
[23:59:03] <BinaryKitten> .attr only changes the html tag
[23:59:14] <BinaryKitten> .prop changes the form object
[23:59:16] <coldhead> and david mark is vindicated
[23:59:20] <abjorn> I know, but if you're just grabbing it, it doesn't matter.
[23:59:31] <Cork> BinaryKitten: no attr changes both too, its what they read from
[23:59:39] <Cork> thats the difference
