[00:00:02] <danheberden> chrome/osx
[00:00:11] <elliotf> hrm
[00:00:14] * elliotf tries it on windows
[00:00:27] <elliotf> ugh, I hate booting this stupid thing.
[00:00:43] <elliotf> danheberden: it's easier to reproduce on remote sources
[00:00:50] <elliotf> danheberden: try the jsbin link I posted
[00:00:51] <gf3> danheberden / elliotf: it's the same bug
[00:01:01] <elliotf> gf3: I agree.
[00:01:05] <gf3> danheberden / elliotf: because the term is set on a timeout
[00:01:06] <elliotf> gf3: not disagreeing at all
[00:01:18] <danheberden> gf3 NO U
[00:01:23] <elliotf> ?
[00:01:24] <gf3> so my fix should take care of both
[00:01:37] <gf3> but how the fuck do you build jquery-ui?
[00:01:39] <elliotf> hrm...
[00:01:47] <elliotf> gf3: but the term will exist from a prior request, no?
[00:01:49] <danheberden> a beautiful ant process
[00:01:55] <elliotf> ...
[00:02:00] <danheberden> MOAR JVM
[00:02:07] <elliotf> wow
[00:02:12] <elliotf> danheberden: you are awesome.
[00:02:17] <elliotf> :)
[00:02:21] <danheberden> haha
[00:02:27] <elliotf> I don't want to wake my wife and child..
[00:02:29] <elliotf> I'd get in trouble
[00:02:34] <elliotf> well, probably not.
[00:02:36] <danheberden> well i'll add you to the list of people that think that.. you are now #2
[00:02:40] <danheberden> underneath "mom"
[00:02:40] <elliotf> almost laught too loud
[00:02:45] <elliotf> wow
[00:02:49] <elliotf> I'll let that one go by
[00:02:54] <elliotf> danheberden: thanks for the set up
[00:03:17] <elliotf> wow, it's really hard to resist, though.
[00:03:23] <elliotf> danheberden: eeevil temptor!
[00:03:50] <elliotf> danheberden: exists on chrome stable on winxp
[00:03:59] <elliotf> danheberden: maybe too much gin.
[00:04:16] <danheberden> elliotf well i was talking about the 1.9 demo
[00:04:18] <danheberden> that i pasted
[00:04:38] <danheberden> you should make sure there isn't a bug already and make a jsfiddle and report the bug
[00:04:55] * elliotf looks through jqui's trac
[00:05:15] <elliotf> danheberden: yes, I was using the link that you pasted
[00:05:48] <elliotf> well, I wasn't, but I just did..
[00:05:51] <elliotf> and it still exists
[00:05:56] <elliotf> in http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/autocomplete/default.html
[00:06:01] <elliotf> for chrome stable on winxp
[00:06:38] <danheberden> silly windows, ruining it for everyone
[00:06:47] <elliotf> ?
[00:06:55] <elliotf> danheberden: problem originally on ubuntu 10.04
[00:07:20] <gf3> elliotf: I guess we could set self.term immediately
[00:07:22] <elliotf> I just have this horrible OS to see how IE makes my life less happy
[00:07:22] <gf3> always
[00:07:32] <elliotf> gf3: that might work...
[00:07:43] <elliotf> gf3: but there's still a race condition.
[00:07:59] <gf3> before the setTimeout
[00:08:03] <elliotf> gf3: between when term is set and the user types and hits escape..
[00:08:17] <elliotf> gf3: ah, set it for every keypress?
[00:08:23] <gf3> yes
[00:08:26] <elliotf> gf3: ++
[00:08:32] <elliotf> I think that would work nicely
[00:08:34] <danheberden> HAX]
[00:08:48] <danheberden> s/\]//
[00:09:01] <elliotf> "HAX" -- says the javascript developer
[00:09:06] <gf3> it's less performant
[00:09:10] <gf3> but should do the trick
[00:09:16] <elliotf> gf3: correct > performant
[00:09:35] <danheberden> apparently elliotf hasn't used zepto
[00:09:39] <danheberden> ?os
[00:09:40] <gf3> lolol
[00:09:40] <bot-t> oh snaoâ„¢
[00:10:08] <elliotf> snao?
[00:10:13] <elliotf> that snap needs more p
[00:10:19] <gf3> it's like "oh snap" but way better

[00:10:42] <danheberden> such is how the interwebs work
[00:12:49] <elliotf> danheberden: http://jsbin.com/enulud/4 should demonstrate the problem.
[00:12:54] <elliotf> you don't have to be fast at all
[00:13:13] <elliotf> no ticket pre-existing.
[00:13:15] <danheberden> haha, i'll take that as .. um, ouch
[00:13:16] <elliotf> making new
[00:13:21] <elliotf> ?
[00:13:28] <elliotf> danheberden: not meant as an insult

[00:14:14] <danheberden> delicious vim
[00:14:28] <danheberden> so, ya, not present in chrome 12 OSX
[00:14:39] <amirite> is the link plugin going to be production?
[00:14:42] <elliotf> hrm.
[00:14:48] <danheberden> chrome 14 howeber
[00:14:50] <danheberden> *however
[00:14:50] <elliotf> danheberden: I don't see how it could not be present.
[00:14:54] <amirite> or does 'search jquery' on jquery.com bring up generic plugin results too
[00:15:19] <elliotf> danheberden: looking at the code it's fairly obvious that it's erroneous...
[00:15:50] <danheberden> not arguing that point, just letting you know for your bug report
[00:15:52] <dimitris5> hello, how can i change a div's height during slideToggle? http://pastebin.com/22Edf2eG
[00:16:09] <danheberden> dimitris5 define 'during'
[00:16:14] <elliotf> grr..

[00:16:36] <danheberden> that's what the kids are callin' 'em these days
[00:16:43] <danheberden> my day, we called 'em tits
[00:17:02] <dimitris5> danheberden: not sure how to say it. Check out the code in pastebin
[00:17:22] <elliotf> ye gods this thing is huge
[00:17:24] <danheberden> dimitris5 i did, and now my eyes hurt
[00:17:30] <danheberden> elliotf twss
[00:17:45] <elliotf> danheberden: right after she said "ow"
[00:18:33] <elliotf> danheberden: it exists on osx
[00:18:37] <dimitris5> danheberden: why? Any ideas on how to do this?
[00:19:54] <danheberden> dimitris5 do you want it to end up at a specific height when it slides in?
[00:20:16] <danheberden> ?xy @ dimitris5
[00:20:17] <bot-t> dimitris5, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[00:20:38] <danheberden> elliotf maybe my lion ate the bug
[00:20:51] <elliotf> danheberden: I seriously doubt that
[00:21:02] <danheberden> its a hungry lion
[00:21:04] <dimitris5> danheberden: check the slider on the left http://home.dakulov.eu:85/ituts.gr/2011/web-design/our-first-html5-website
[00:21:09] <danheberden> it keeps mind fucking me with swiping left and right
[00:21:12] <elliotf> danheberden: feed it some marbles
[00:21:13] <danheberden> and scrolling
[00:21:24] <dimitris5> danheberden: press the "Share" button and you will understand what i want to do
[00:21:26] <MACscr> hmm, how can i set the opacity on the body background image? i know how to do it for a class or id, but im not sure how to just do it on the background image
[00:22:03] <danheberden> dimitris5 you want the whole box to grow
[00:22:34] <dimitris5> danheberden: yes i guess. How can i do this?
[00:22:43] <danheberden> dimitris5 your problem is in css, not js
[00:22:55] <danheberden> the fact that when visible, the blue box just sits there is a probem
[00:23:12] <danheberden> get it to look write with that content visible ( i.e. slid down) first
[00:23:36] <danheberden> namely, non-fixed heights and float the share button and clear below
[00:23:40] <dimitris5> danheberden: damn, you are right. I fixed it, thanks. Any ides on how make it more smooth?
[00:23:51] <danheberden> lotion
[00:23:59] <danheberden> or css3 transitions
[00:24:10] <danheberden> and add/remove classes instead of relying on js animations
[00:25:44] <dimitris5> danheberden: what should i google to get examples on the add/remove classes thing?
[00:26:02] <danheberden> anything talking about using css3 transitions
[00:26:06] <danheberden> :)
[00:26:34] <danheberden> nimbupani.com has some good posts
[00:26:38] <dimitris5> danheberden: will they work on older browsers?
[00:26:44] <danheberden> dimitris5 nah
[00:26:56] <elliotf> dimitris5: adding/removing classes:  http://api.jquery.com/addClass/ http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/ ?
[00:27:05] <danheberden> like ff3.6, chrome 10, opera 11 and ie9-ish
[00:27:26] <elliotf> heh...  ie9
[00:27:36] <danheberden> you could also use modernizr to detect if you can do transitions and use js when you have to
[00:27:43] <danheberden> the possibilities are endless!
[00:29:21] <dimitris5> thanks :)
[00:30:00] <danheberden> remember that when we pass the collection plate
[00:30:30] <danieliser> any way to leave height on auto and when the height of the content changes reposition the modal?
[00:30:49] <cornflake> how do i put in a callback function for a function?
[00:31:00] <danheberden> danieliser like to keep it centered vertically?
[00:31:00] <cornflake> e.g. $.get(function() { foo(param1) }, fucntion() { bar(param2) });
[00:31:13] <danieliser> say i have a show/hide section.. when you click show and it fades in recenter it..
[00:31:23] <danheberden> cornflake huh?
[00:31:25] <danieliser> danherberden: yes basically
[00:31:57] <danheberden> there's some new box alignment stuff in css3
[00:32:01] <danheberden> that might fit the bill
[00:32:08] <danieliser> can do it fine when the modal first loads.. but i have a show more button that fades in a hidden div.. height changes. tried .resize().. didnt work
[00:32:28] <danieliser> could always do display:table-cell; vertical-align:center;
[00:32:28] <cornflake> danheberden, $.get(FirstFunction, CallBackFunction)
[00:32:33] <cornflake> doesn't work
[00:32:54] <danheberden> why are you getting a function?
[00:33:04] <danheberden> ?xy @ cornflake
[00:33:04] <bot-t> cornflake, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[00:33:32] <inZania> good morning all. I'm being driven bonkers by an ajax query failing for just some users, but 100% of the time. May I paste the full question + image/pastebin links please?
[00:34:18] <danheberden> it'd be cooler if you used jsfiddle.net and used the sample/testing api to make a working test case, inZania but whatevs
[00:34:20] <elliotf> wow, jquery ui's trac is sloooow
[00:34:20] <cornflake> danheberden, i'm trying to get a function to repeat itself through a confirm button after it finishes
[00:34:44] <danheberden> and where does that come into play with the ajax request cornflake?
[00:34:55] <elliotf> gf3, danheberden : http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7579
[00:35:18] <danheberden> hawt elliotf
[00:35:26] <elliotf> twss, danheberden
[00:35:50] <danheberden> :D
[00:36:20] <inZania> Some of the users of my Chrome browser extension are having trouble with an ajax request (it works fine for me and most). The error handler is being triggered but I can't figure out why. They can load the page fine in a browser. The 3 parameters given to the error handler are not helpful. Here's a scrrenshot of their log; the 3 paramaters given to the error handler can be seen in 3 lines after "Facebook session errored out" http://s
[00:36:28] <elliotf> danheberden: is there a way to get a custom build that is not minimized?
[00:36:38] <cornflake> basically, i'm trying to create another version of chat roulette. the problem is that i don't wanna mess w/ the code that creates the actual chatbox and i'd rather it just merely ask the user "do you want to continue" when the chat is over
[00:36:44] <gf3> elliotf: woot
[00:36:55] <danheberden> um... not without doing it yourself
[00:37:05] <elliotf> gf3: you have solutionage, or is that in response to my excellently crafted ticket?
[00:37:19] <elliotf> blegh, grabbing https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.14/jquery-ui.js
[00:37:23] <elliotf> noncompressed ftw
[00:39:14] <inZania> here's a pastebin for the above ^ question : http://pastebin.com/at3i2RLf
[00:39:35] <dimitris5> danheberden: is there any way to make the content in the hidden div to load only after i press the share button?
[00:40:04] <dimitris5> danheberden: so the site could load faster
[00:41:35] <inZania> you could put the content in another page and then use a $.load()
[00:41:52] <inZania> but you're just deferring the content load then
[00:42:44] <inZania> if you're going for maximum load time, put the content in the hidden div, start an ajjax query on startup to get the content, use .html() to replace the div's content when available, and .show() to  show it when ready
[00:42:56] <inZania> err put the content in another page I mean
[00:43:57] <dimitris5> inZania: do you know any tutorial on this?
[00:44:00] <inZania> you're essentially using the time when the user is twiddling his thumbs before pressing the button to be loading more content via the ajax query, so the initial page load is faster and the subsequent display of content is ready ASAP
[00:44:32] <inZania> @dimitris5 just look up each of the commands
[00:46:43] <inZania> dimitris5, her's some quick sample code I hacked together: http://pastebin.com/nURdzSfu
[00:48:38] <dimitris5> inZania: thanks. what goes in my_content ? in $.get('my_content',null,function(d)
[00:48:46] <dimitris5> inZania: url to page?
[00:49:25] <elliotf> gf3: I have a relatively hacky fix...
[00:49:28] <elliotf> gf3: making a patch now
[00:52:08] <elliotf> hrm, vim is eating my tabs, as I tell it to.
[00:52:40] <elliotf> :set et!
[00:57:15] <elliotf> weird..  I don't see where I can upload a patch file to jquery ui's trac
[00:59:30] <v12EMiiX> Hello
[01:01:55] <gf3> elliotf: you'd need to make a pull-request on github
[01:02:10] <elliotf> gf3: hrm...  blegh
[01:03:32] <elliotf> gf3: would you like to see the patch?
[01:03:40] <gf3> sure
[01:04:29] <elliotf> gf3: it doesn't need to be private..
[01:06:14] <elliotf> gf3: http://pastebin.com/eaYeRrWD
[01:06:28] <elliotf> gf3: seems to work alright
[01:06:31] <elliotf> gf3: suggestions welcome
[01:07:30] <elliotf> wow, the minimization of jquery ui does some interesting things
[01:08:57] <elliotf> it collapsed if(/* test */) { if (/* test */) { /* do something */ } into (/*test*/)&&(/*test*/)&& /* do something */
[01:09:02] <elliotf> kind of interesting
[01:15:00] <elliotf> gf3: wow, editing minified js kind of sucks.
[01:15:13] <elliotf> gf3: that patch fixes 1.8.14 for me.
[01:34:07] <elliotf> gf3: that wasn't so bad:  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/403
[01:36:58] <na3r> hi
[01:37:14] <na3r> how can i change body background in jquery mobile ?
[02:01:36] <MACscr> is it possible to set background image opacity with jquery?
[02:01:53] <MACscr> if so, how?
[02:08:06] <coldhead> MACscr: it's not possible
[02:08:15] <MACscr> crap
[02:08:21] <coldhead> you can fake it
[02:08:33] <coldhead> by using an actual image, not a bg img
[02:08:45] <coldhead> and fading that
[02:09:05] <MACscr> well, its for the body background =/
[02:10:13] <coldhead> you could probably still do that
[02:10:50] <coldhead> but its icky
[02:13:57] <crab> hi coldhead.
[02:15:46] <coldhead> hi crabsy
[02:17:26] <dr0id> hi boiz
[03:04:53] <davidw> hey guys, I'm looking for a 'best practice' sort of thing: I have some JS code that, when you click a button, inserts a fairly big chunk of HTML in the document.  Having that as a string kind of sucks... is there a better way?
[03:08:39] <samuel02> davidw, could you paste code somewhere?
[03:09:09] <davidw> samuel02, not really, I don't see how that would help.
[03:09:29] <davidw> I have a click(function() { .... insert a big chunk of HTML in the DOM ... })
[03:09:55] <davidw> it's pretty simple to accomplish, the question is "is there a way to be clever/organized about it so I'm not just using one big huge long string?"
[03:10:35] <davidw> instead of $('#foo').html("bar"), bar is quite a large bunch of html
[03:11:02] <samuel02> davidw, well I can't really see why you would like to do that? easier to just show() the html
[03:11:09] <samuel02> ?
[03:11:49] <davidw> samuel02, good point.  However I'm inserting it into a ckeditor instance where it's just physically not there and can't be ahead of time
[03:12:43] <shesek> davidw, <script type="text/template" id="foobar">....</script>, $('#foobar').html()
[03:13:18] <samuel02> davidw, ok well.. have you checked out jquery templates?
[03:14:35] <callumacrae> How do I select all elements where a data attribute is set to something? Would I have to use $('a[data-foo="bar"]')?
[03:14:46] <shesek> callumacrae, yes
[03:14:53] <callumacrae> okay, thanks
[03:15:09] <davidw> samuel02, no... interesting... having a look now
[03:15:12] <davidw> thanks
[03:15:18] <shesek> davidw, However, you can still insert an DOM element from the page to the iframe. <div id="foobar" style="display:none">.... bug chunk of html ....</div>, $(frameElement.contentWindow.document.body).appendChild($('#foobar'.html().show()))
[03:17:03] <shesek> davidw, from your description you don't need to use templates, just use the <script> thingy I said or insert an existing hidden dom element like in the second example
[03:17:53] <davidw> shesek, 2nd example would work... seems a little bit ugly having this HTML document with large chunks of html that are simply hidden...
[03:18:01] <davidw> but it'd work and probably be better than using a string
[03:19:33] <shesek> Well, there isn't a nice way to put large chunks of HTML in javascript, and other than storing in the HTML document (as a <script type="text/template"> or a hidden element) your only choice is fetching it with AJAX, which is even uglier and issues extra HTTP requests
[03:20:03] <dev21546> hello
[03:20:50] <RikudoSennin> if I want to set the same submit handler on every form on the page, can I use $("form").submit();? or do I need to use .each?
[03:21:22] <dev21546> that would do it for all forms on the page.
[03:21:44] <RikudoSennin> what?
[03:21:48] <RikudoSennin> what would do it?
[03:22:07] <dev21546> $("form").submit();
[03:22:15] <dev21546> at least I think

[03:42:25] <Back2Basics> pavan:  nope
[03:43:21] <pavan> When I  click on a link I want to display a content (already loaded in div) next to that link (kinda lika  a tool tip)
[03:43:38] <pavan> that div will have proper html
[03:46:24] <RikudoSennin> pavan, check the manual for .click() and .show() or .fadeIn()

[03:53:21] <donCams> hi. can scripts in parent listen to events on contents inside iframe?

[05:25:04] <shesek> Anyone happens to use YQL's web.search and can check if its working for him? (I know its off-topic, but there isn't really an on-topic channel for this question, and some people here might be using that)
[05:26:46] <shesek> Never mind, it was removed 3 days ago :-(
[05:28:44] <coldhead> that's a shame :(
[05:31:09] <shesek> coldhead, yup. they replaced it with their BOSS thingy, which costs money. http://www.yqlblog.net/blog/2011/07/20/search-tables-and-boss-v1/
[05:32:22] <shesek> This really sucks, I was counting on it for something I'm building
[05:32:50] <coldhead> can you wire up something with YQL that uses google behind the scenes?
[05:33:55] <shesek> I tried, but Google blocks search engines from accessing the search results using his robots.txt (which YQL respects)
[05:34:04] <shesek> I wonder if I can do that with Yahoo's search tho
[05:34:30] <coldhead> http://www.yahoo.com/robots.txt
[05:34:33] <coldhead> hmm
[05:34:36] <shesek> Nope, its also blocked
[05:34:45] <shesek> error="Redirected to a robots.txt restricted URL: http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=crmas&amp;p=test"
[05:35:25] <shesek> Google's JSONP web search service is also quite useless, it returns a VERY limited number of results
[05:35:45] <shesek> Sometimes I get like 3 results when the regular web search has 10k+
[05:35:59] <coldhead> i guess they want to keep their search dominance for themselves
[05:37:34] <shesek> Hmmm, what about some branded google search? there are some of those out there, maybe one of them doesn't block search engines? (something like ICQ or Conduit)
[05:38:27] <coldhead> but if you're accessing it via yahoo and without branding...
[05:38:38] <coldhead> you're probably desperate enough to try though
[05:39:49] <ruby_on_tails> hello
[05:39:59] <coldhead> hey rubsy
[05:40:16] <ruby_on_tails> i want to execute a ajax request and the code below it should execute after the ejax request gets its response, i canput the below code in a callback or a function
[05:40:19] <ruby_on_tails> hi coldsy
[05:40:50] <coldhead> you have to set async to false for that, rubsy
[05:41:01] <ruby_on_tails> i did it
[05:41:05] <ruby_on_tails> but it doesnt seem to work
[05:41:11] <coldhead> ?p @ ruby_on_tails
[05:41:11] <bot-t> ruby_on_tails, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:41:22] <coldhead> it locks up the browser too :(
[05:41:26] <ruby_on_tails> yes
[05:41:28] <ruby_on_tails> it locked up
[05:41:36] <ruby_on_tails> but the firebug shows that the request was completed
[05:41:38] <Techdeck> hey guys
[05:41:50] <coldhead> why can't youy use the callback, ruby_on_tails?
[05:41:53] <Techdeck> anyone knows if there's a way to detect a certain $.ajax command was 'aborted' by me?
[05:41:53] <coldhead> that's what it's meant for
[05:42:12] <ruby_on_tails> the code is funny, not getting enough money to remodel it
[05:42:24] <KuW8t>  i have a jquery object with a table. in the table td's are links and text. i have to edit the href to every link where the href begins with "/eu/linkToFile.php"
[05:42:30] <ruby_on_tails> but wil do it with the async feature, its a very small thing actually
[05:42:33] <shesek> coldhead, Muhahaha! select href from html where url='http://search.conduit.com/Results.aspx?q=test' AND xpath='.//div[@class="items"]//a[@class="title"]' :D
[05:42:56] <coldhead> ruby_on_tails: i had to do something on a legacy system last week where it was simplest just to bind to $(document).bind('ajaxComplete') and test there
[05:43:17] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[05:44:29] <coldhead> KuW8t: $('a[href*="/eu/wjatever"]').attr('href', 'sometotherurl')
[05:44:47] <coldhead> ahhaha good job shesek :)
[05:45:12] <KuW8t> coldhead: and a is my jquery object?
[05:45:12] <shesek> I wonder how long until they'll block that
[05:45:26] <coldhead> a is <a>

[06:19:51] <KuW8t> RikudoSennin: understand now?
[06:25:09] <KuW8t> $(data).find('a[href*="/en/"]').attr('href', 'http://www.JustAnotherSite.eu/en/')       <-- here i want to change every link beginning with /en/ in my obj data. it works fine atm. but i need to save the rest of the link too. short: only add a prefix to the links with /en/. HOW!?!

[09:37:03] <o1iver> Hi Everyone. I have a JS performance issue. I am binding inview (plugin for when an item becomes viewable in the pane) to search results. When they become visible an ajax (getJSON) request is fired an modifies the visible element depending on the response. The problem is that the search may return up to 2000-5000 results. My browser crashes/freezes and I guess it has to do with the fact that I am binding events to x000 divs... Any tips on
[09:37:04] <o1iver>  how I could change that?
[09:40:30] <Vorspire> o1iver, pagination? result limitations?
[09:42:36] <o1iver> Vorspire: yes I have thought about that, but that doesn't fit with the style of the page very well... I am currently thinking about also binding the events using inview... ie. bind the events for the next scroll when the current scroll happened. Is there some sort of guideline as to how many events should maximally be bound on a page?
[09:42:44] <bfred> o1iver: you should use .live() instead
[09:42:53] <bfred> it will only append one event
[09:42:58] <o1iver> bfred: I thought live was even worse
[09:43:05] <bfred> o1iver: me too
[09:43:10] <bfred> but it isn't
[09:43:18] <bfred> just attach it to their parent
[09:43:56] <o1iver> currently: 1). enter search 2). fetch search results with ajax 3). bind inview to each result after display
[09:44:06] <bfred> also, are you sure that the the events are what it's freezing the browser?
[09:44:07] <o1iver> bfred: what do you mean parent? the parent div?
[09:44:16] <Vorspire> I just wouldn't display 5000 results on the same page tbh, that's my solution lol
[09:44:42] <o1iver> bfred: no
[09:45:00] <o1iver> Vorspire: yeah I will have to think about that :-p
[09:45:26] <o1iver> bfred: it coudl also be the ajax request that happens when the object comes into view
[09:45:43] <bfred> o1iver: yes, if those 5000 elements are LI's, you say $('ul').delegate('li', 'eventname', fn)
[09:45:56] <bfred> UL is LI's parent
[09:46:35] <bfred> o1iver: also, how are you creating and appending those elements to the page?
[09:47:18] <o1iver> bfred: they are divs...(because they are displayed as boxed)...
[09:48:01] <bfred> o1iver: that was an example, attach the delegated event to the closest common parent
[09:48:03] <o1iver> http://pastebin.com/PgUiw0mC
[09:49:13] <o1iver> bfred: ok I will try that
[09:49:26] <o1iver> bfred: does that save jquery the trouble of looking through the whole DOM?
[09:50:51] <bfred> o1iver: oh, god, yes
[09:51:17] <o1iver> bfred: "god"?
[09:51:29] <o1iver> bfred: sounds like I am doing something crazy
[09:51:31] <o1iver> :-p
[09:51:44] <bfred> currently, you're not only attaching 5000 events, but you're also searching every element via $('selector')
[09:51:52] <bfred> that's why it's slow
[09:52:42] <bfred> a better way would be, storing v as a data-attr and accessing it in the event
[09:52:53] <o1iver> the containg div has id "search_results", so how do I delegate it?
[09:53:08] <bfred> hold on
[09:53:55] <o1iver> bfred: ok. thanks for the help btw
[09:56:03] <bfred> http://pastebin.com/M2Ui7fj1
[09:56:06] <bfred> something like this
[09:56:30] <bfred> mind the data-v=\" + v + "\" during the creation
[09:57:30] <bfred> any questions about the code, ask
[09:58:34] <o1iver> bfred: thank. going through it now
[10:01:28] <o1iver> bfred: so data-v=\" + v + "\" is saving v in the DOM and then you access it again using $(this).data('v') right?
[10:01:40] <bfred> exactly
[10:02:11] <bfred> if you're not using the id anywhere else, you can avoid setting it
[10:02:44] <o1iver> mmh didn't know you could do that. well I just tried it and it is still very slow, but I think the reason might also just be the length of the list. I am for example showing a loader gif for each item. And I think even that causes the browser to overload
[10:03:11] <o1iver> I am currently trying it with 1000 items and it freezes
[10:03:32] <bfred> what is slow? loading/attaching them or just using the browser after?
[10:04:46] <o1iver> well the list returns the 1000 elements and then just freezes. I mean the inview event is triggered and the ajax requests fired and also the response works, but it is just incredibly slow (if I try to scroll it doesn't really work)
[10:05:19] <bfred> try appending them without attaching any event
[10:06:28] <bfred> also, you can get rid of some elements by just leaving something like <div class='search_result'><div>v</div><img/></div>
[10:06:46] <bfred> or, remove the search_result class completely
[10:07:19] <bfred> no, not that
[10:07:38] <bfred> you can select them in CSS with ".search_result div" and ".search_result img"
[10:09:37] <tomasm-> is it possible to use a custom version of jquery.ui.resizable.js so I can debug the code since it's otherwise minified?
[10:10:41] <o1iver> bfred: so attaching them without an event seems to works fine
[10:11:07] <bfred> probably it's the event in view causing too much trouble
[10:11:08] <o1iver> bfred: but I think I have to take a moment to go over my structure again... (like you are saying)
[10:11:11] <bfred> or firing too often
[10:11:13] <bfred> hold on
[10:11:37] <o1iver> bfred: yes that is what I am thinking too (since showing 4000 results works just fine)
[10:11:51] <JamesTaylor> can anyone hel me with an autocomplete error $("#search_val").autocomplete is not a function
[10:11:55] <JamesTaylor> *help
[10:12:46] <JamesTaylor> it works find in a test environment, it works find on many other pages, accept one page where i'm using a calandar control, and a tooltip plugin
[10:12:52] <JamesTaylor> *fine >.<
[10:13:10] <JamesTaylor> *except my god i must be tired lol
[10:14:54] <bfred> o1iver: I couldn't improve it any more than this: http://pastebin.com/Hajbm35e
[10:15:10] <bfred> ah, I forgot something
[10:15:40] <o1iver> bfred: I think it must be inview. I mean everytime the page is scrolled the check all inview events must be triggered (I guess) and that means that the position of all x000 search result divs is compared to the current view pane
[10:15:41] <bfred> http://pastebin.com/JdJzyeFg
[10:15:58] <bfred> o1iver: hehe then yes
[10:16:09] <bfred> what are you trying to do anyway?
[10:16:59] <bfred> instead of in view, you might want to check this out: http://larsjung.de/fracs/
[10:17:27] <bfred> check the demo
[10:18:27] <o1iver> bfred: I am just screenshooting to show you what I am trying to do
[10:18:37] <bfred> ok
[10:20:12] <o1iver> http://o1iver.net/media/ss.png
[10:20:18] <o1iver> bfred: ^
[10:21:07] <bfred> sure, you can't post porn in here
[10:21:29] <o1iver> ??
[10:22:43] <bfred> :P just kidding
[10:23:44] <bfred> why are you checking for in view?
[10:24:46] <o1iver> because that way I don't overload my server with ajax requests for result nr. 1002 when the user is still at the top of the page (every domain is checked individually)
[10:25:21] <o1iver> bfred: so 2000 results without the inview check would lead to 2000 ajax requests (although I did play with bundling the requests)
[10:25:26] <bfred> o1iver: I would just check for the scroll and determine what elements are visible
[10:26:56] <o1iver> bfred: using fracs for example you mean? I guess that makes sense as it removes the need to add an event to every result. That's actually a very good idea. I will try that now! Cheers...
[10:27:06] <bfred> yes
[10:28:06] <bfred> also, this is event better: http://pastebin.com/593Qigu9
[10:28:23] <bfred> make #search_results a UL element and use the image as background for LI's
[10:28:35] <bfred> so, so much lighter than it was initially
[10:29:09] <o1iver> good idea too and then just space the li elemnts
[10:29:17] <o1iver> thanks
[10:29:42] <bfred> one last thing, is does (n) search for any number?
[10:29:53] <o1iver> yes
[10:30:00] <bfred> so how do I search for n?
[10:30:08] <o1iver> by just typing n
[10:30:22] <o1iver> or what do you mean?
[10:30:30] <bfred> true
[10:30:37] <o1iver> nnn(n) would be "nnn1", "nnn2", etc
[10:30:49] <o1iver> you like the idea?
[10:30:52] <bfred> but (m,n) = either "m" or "n" and (n) = number
[10:30:56] <bfred> it's confusing
[10:31:06] <bfred> regex solves that by using \d for numbers
[10:31:12] <bfred> *that confusion
[10:31:22] <bfred> and \w for letters
[10:31:35] <o1iver> yes...I was actually going to use regex first...but then I thought that regex would be too hard to "normal" people
[10:31:56] <bfred> in your case, you could use [n] for numbers and (m,n) for letters
[10:32:00] <o1iver> (x,x) is a list (x-x) is a range and (x) are special character (vowels, etc)
[10:32:25] <bfred> use brackets for special characters
[10:32:40] * bfred loves lion's autocorrect already 
[10:32:57] <o1iver> bfred: yeah thats how it was initially (well actually  [] for lists and ranges) but then I changed it because of simplicity (but I will thnik about it again)
[10:32:58] <bfred> goodbye typos, hello wrong autocorrects
[10:33:27] <bfred> alsoâ€¦. wel
[10:33:33] <bfred> *well...
[10:33:43] <bfred> why are you even using ajax?
[10:33:57] <bfred> you can create those domains with javascript
[10:34:20] <bfred> scroll, add new possibilities, check their existence
[10:34:20] <bfred> a-la facebook
[10:34:26] <o1iver> well its parse and then generate
[10:34:40] <bfred> use ajax just to *check* them, not to create them
[10:34:41] <o1iver> but yeah you could do that
[10:35:00] <o1iver> you think it will be faster that way?
[10:35:06] <bfred> this way you can create them few at a time and do it fast
[10:35:09] <bfred> a lot
[10:35:35] <o1iver> my current algorithm cannot create a few at a time
[10:35:52] <bfred> only thing, make sure the algorithm is fast, otherwise the browser will freeze during creation
[10:36:03] <bfred> you'd have to rethink it, then
[10:36:09] <o1iver> because it builds up the possibilities ie ["a"] -> ["ab", "ac"] -> ["ab1", "ac1"]
[10:36:35] <o1iver> I will have to rethink that, but the biggest bottleneck if the whois check
[10:36:37] <o1iver> by far
[10:36:49] <o1iver> 1000 combinations return in < 1sec
[10:37:09] <o1iver> even faster
[10:37:13] <o1iver> 10000 < 1sec
[10:37:38] <bfred> o1iver: ok, then store all the combinations in an array
[10:37:44] <bfred> and show them gradually
[10:37:50] <bfred> ;)
[10:37:53] <o1iver> yes...I was thinking that before too
[10:37:58] <o1iver> makes a lot more sense
[10:38:15] <o1iver> and then when the user scrolls the rest appears and the checks are done
[10:38:30] <bfred> ;)
[10:38:34] <o1iver> makes everything a lot simpler. And I guess the data() function is great for that
[10:38:45] <o1iver> can I bind using data()? or just read?
[10:38:45] <bfred> hm??
[10:38:57] <bfred> .data('name',value)
[10:38:58] <bfred> both
[10:39:01] <o1iver> like do seomthing like $(document).data("domains", domains)...
[10:39:02] <bfred> butâ€¦ for what?
[10:39:30] <o1iver> well the request gets sent out, all x000 combinations come back and then I show them as the user scrolls... or were you thinking ot something else?
[10:39:46] <bfred> what do you mean by x000 combinations?
[10:40:34] <o1iver> bfred: well the user types the search expression, a request returns the possible domain combinations and fills the view pane, then sends the requests checking them, then as the user scrolls further down more combinations are shown (and the requests for those sent our)
[10:40:38] <o1iver> *out
[10:40:46] <bfred> create combinations, store them in array, create first 10 elements for each of the combinations, check their availability.
[10:40:59] <bfred> yes
[10:41:18] <o1iver> that is actually very good then I can save all that event hell :-p
[10:42:04] <bfred> only thing, how are you going to match domain.com's availability with its LI?
[10:42:09] <o1iver> but what I meant with data() was that I have to save the combination array somewhere after the first request... wouldn't you save it there until they are needed again when the user scrolls
[10:42:40] <bfred> o1iver: you store it in a global variable, no need for data
[10:43:03] <bfred> *.data
[10:43:04] <o1iver> bfred: ok, that shows my lack of javascript skill and understanding of how its run in the browser
[10:43:12] <bfred> :P
[10:43:30] <jbrokc> trying to write my first jquery function and i'm having trouble - inside of this function, this always refers to nothing when it's called on a jQuery object. what gives? -- https://gist.github.com/0065125c73424e8dbfcd --
[10:43:30] <o1iver> damn...didn't know that
[10:44:05] <o1iver> so what is the best way of getting to the correct li when the request returns available/unavailable? Anything better than using the ID?
[10:46:23] <bfred> o1iver: store the element in the array, together with the combination
[10:47:32] <bfred> o1iver: http://d.pr/pCoK
[10:48:29] <bfred> create the combination ARRAY with names only, scroll through it as the user scrolls, create/append elements to the dom, and save the element's reference in the array
[10:48:54] <o1iver> bfred: crazy. It really never crossed my mind that there was persistence accross javascript events (if that makes sense). I thought it was kinda more like a PHP script. thanks for fixing that great oversight
[10:50:00] <o1iver> so I can create an element, append it to the dom and the reference it again just by saving that reference (JS skills (or lack thereof) showing again)
[10:50:01] <bfred> when the availability results come back, they can still be in order, so combinations[1].element.addClass('found')
[10:51:32] <o1iver> bfred: Ok. I am going to get started now. Thanks again for all the help and the patience :-)
[10:51:37] <callumacrae> How do I get .children to check every level?
[10:51:48] <callumacrae> ...that didn't make sense
[10:51:49] <bfred> o1iver: me too, back to work :P
[10:51:58] <bfred> callumacrae: it did
[10:52:00] <o1iver> bfred: hehe ok see u
[10:52:03] <bfred> .find('selector')
[10:52:17] <callumacrae> thanks!

[11:21:09] <Kenjin> hello
[11:23:05] <Kenjin> What is the proper way of dealing with a "uncaught exception [object Object]". I'm getting when a getJSON response returns no data
[11:23:12] <Kenjin> *getting this
[11:33:50] <jkoudys> not finding anything on this: How can I take a list of image URLs, and cycle through them really quickly? I want an effect similar to what I see on the top-left here: http://cargocollective.com , except just changing the background-image (that site is cycling through a huge list of divs so the HTML is ugly)
[11:39:42] <lastk> I do that: element = $('.products').last();   is possible to know the position of element on $('.products');  ?
[11:51:08] <deed02392> Hi guys, I'm trying to do $(button).closest() and getting the error that it is not a function
[11:51:22] <deed02392> jquery is indeed imported and being used
[11:51:42] <deed02392> (like so <script src="static/functions/jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>)
[11:52:53] <Thomas`-> if i dynamically add a <script src= with .html()  how would i tell jquery to make the browser parse and reload the script?
[11:57:47] <tp43_> Thomas`-, I had some issues with dynamically loaded elements that some here help me fix by using live(), but I can't image why you would want to dynamically add a <script src
[11:58:02] <tp43_> I mean, just include it and call it dynamically
[11:58:25] <tp43_> How many lines could it be that you are saving so much by adding it only dynamically
[11:59:33] <o1iver> hey guys. If I append a div to an existing div (I am using $("#xx").append(html)) how can I keep a reference to the new div so that I can later do something like $(appended_div).do_something()?
[11:59:38] <Thomas`-> the adding it dynamically triggers the script to run the script completley over from the start (which i need)
[12:00:29] <Thomas`-> need it to reload after certain events
[12:01:24] <o1iver> anybody?
[12:02:05] <Thomas`-> o1iver, i used last(), but theres probablly a better way
[12:03:26] <o1iver> Thomas`-: ok I see how that can work, but I guess that there must a better way that does not require jquery to traverse the elements again, just to get that new element
[12:04:00] <Thomas`-> yeah thats what i thought too but had no luck finding the better solution
[12:04:38] <o1iver> Thomas`-: plus my "list" has thousands of elements :-p
[12:05:30] <Thomas`-> :)
[12:05:38] <Thomas`-> im not sure
[12:15:40] <deed02392> I'm trying to reset an elements ID, I try this: $(button).closest('div').attr('id', '');
[12:16:02] <deed02392> but I get the error that $(button).closest is not a function
[12:26:27] <djQuery> mornin
[12:27:55] <outoftime> is there a particularly well-loved jQuery book that would be appropriate for novice programmers?
[12:30:58] <o1iver> Thomas`-: so I figured out how to save the reference to a new element
[12:31:54] <Thomas`-> o1iver, cool - how did you do it?
[12:32:01] <o1iver> Thomas`-: what u do is you create the element like this: var new_elem = $("<div>", ...) and then do something like $("#ss").append(new_elem) and then just keep new_elem
[12:32:25] <o1iver> works prefectly
[12:32:40] <Thomas`-> ahh good idea.  thanks i'll remember that
[12:34:03] <ElCapitanMarklar> hey a bit of a non jquery q here but what type of loop is best for javascript these days? is a negative while loop still a lot faster than a positive for loop?

[12:49:29] <chilversc> deed02392: which version of jquery are you using?
[12:50:13] <deed02392> the latest chilversc
[12:50:22] <deed02392> v1.6.2
[12:50:36] <chilversc> I assume jquery is correctly loaded and assigned to the $ function?
[12:50:52] <deed02392> it's included chilversc, in a <script> tag
[12:51:00] <chilversc> in the console, what does $.fn.closest show?
[12:51:32] <deed02392> how would I perform that check chilversc?
[12:51:37] <deed02392> i've got firebug loaded
[12:52:05] <chilversc> deed02392: in the firebug window just run; $.fn.closest, and it should output a function(a,b)... type thing
[12:52:15] <chilversc> if it does, closest exists and jquery is correctly loaded
[12:52:19] <m0dmd> hi everybody.
[12:52:37] <chilversc> I'd probably place a breakpoint on the line that is erroring, and test that at the point you're getting the error
[12:52:45] <deed02392> oh, no I get undefined chilversc
[12:53:05] <chilversc> deed02392: then jquery's probably not loaded at that point in time
[12:53:06] <deed02392> is there a procedure I need to undergo other than just including jquery in a script html tag?
[12:53:23] <chilversc> deed02392: nope, but obviously, the jquery script needs to be included before your script
[12:53:49] <deed02392> it is the first included script on the page though chilversc
[12:54:06] <deed02392> in order of the html, it's included like: <script src="static/functions/jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[12:54:17] <chilversc> deed02392: so just running "$" on its own at that point shows "function(a,b)..." ?
[12:54:20] <malinens> how to uncheck selected radio value? Stupid Firefox saves state of previously checked value and drives me nuts!
[12:54:38] <deed02392> chilversc running just $ on its own gives: function()
[12:55:08] <chilversc> deed02392: this? "function (a,b){return new e.fn.init(a,b,h)}" or similar to?
[12:55:21] <ElCapitanMarklar> hi guys I started knocking up a small trading game loosly based on the old DrugWars game, http://jsfiddle.net/ElCapitanMarklar/TqqAt/ it still has a few bugs but if you could have a look at let me know anything that I should improve that would be much appreciated
[12:55:33] <deed02392> no chilversc, litereally on the firebug console:
[12:55:34] <deed02392> >>> $
[12:55:34] <deed02392> function()
[12:55:44] <deed02392> nothing else
[12:56:11] <djQuery> malinens: see ?.prop
[12:56:11] <bot-t> malinens, .prop() - Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[12:56:12] <chilversc> deed02392: that's odd, I don't think you're using the jquery you think you are
[12:56:27] <chilversc> deed02392: try changing it to src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.2.min.js" and test with that one for a momemnt
[12:56:28] <malinens> thaaaanks
[12:56:50] <deed02392> oh hang on a sec chilversc, it's looking like the cms i'm using overwrites $
[12:56:52] <djQuery> malinens: .prop('checked', false);
[12:56:56] <chilversc> deed02392: also, check you're not loading any other libraries such as mootools, or prototype that might change the $
[12:57:06] <malinens> double thanks!!!
[12:57:11] <deed02392> facepalm
[12:57:18] <djQuery> malinens: or .removeAttr('checked')
[12:57:22] <malinens> I tried attr('checked', false) and failed
[12:57:27] <deed02392> you put me on the right track chilversc, i'll go investigate how i can avoid this overwriting
[12:57:30] <chilversc> deed02392: ah, then you're going to have to use jQuery('...')...
[12:57:35] <malinens> removeAttr also didn't help
[12:57:51] <deed02392> instead of $('...')? i could live with that
[12:57:53] <djQuery> malinens: with 1.6 and higher you need to use .prop for somethings
[12:57:57] <deed02392> i think it overwrites it with sizzle actually
[12:58:05] <deed02392> so i guess a todo could be replacing all that with the full jquery
[12:58:08] <lindsayo> is this the place to solicit a contractor?
[12:58:15] <deed02392> but for now I can just use jQuery() instead of $()
[12:58:16] <malinens> ok
[12:58:17] <djQuery> malinens: http://which-should-i-use.ossreleasefeed.com/
[12:58:19] <lindsayo> I need someone to build a slider on a Drupal site.
[12:58:22] <chilversc> deed02392: depends if your cms supports de-conflicting the $ function, if it doesn't you should call jQuery.noConflict
[12:58:28] <chilversc> deed02392: see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[12:58:49] <malinens> thanks! it says- prop ;-)
[12:59:21] <djQuery> deed02392: or just put your code inside a closure    (function($){ your code here })(jQuery)
[13:00:02] <djQuery> deed02392: then no matter what $ is outside the closure it is jQuery inside it
[13:00:32] <deed02392> wouldn't $ be the cms' library though djQuery?
[13:00:40] <deed02392> oh wait i see
[13:01:00] <deed02392> very interesting djQuery
[13:02:29] <djQuery> deed02392: by the way that is the way just about every jquery plugin works so that they dont have to worry about conflicts in the $
[13:03:03] <chilversc> yup, you might need the jQuery.noConflict in case the CMS doesn't do anything similar
[13:03:18] <chilversc> otherwise the CMS might be supprised to find its $ has suddenly become jQuery :)
[13:03:35] <deed02392> haha yeah
[13:03:45] <deed02392> right this has been helpful
[13:03:54] <deed02392> got some reading to do
[13:03:55] <deed02392> cheers again
[13:04:29] <djQuery> chilversc: not inside the closure. and if you needed access to the CMS version of the $ you could do something like. (function($, CMS){ your code here })(jQuery, $)
[13:05:26] <djQuery> deed02392: ^^^^^^^^^
[13:05:47] <deed02392> that is fantastic
[13:05:50] <chilversc> djQuery: right, but I was more thinking if the CMS isn't doing that with its $ it might break things if noConflict isn't used
[13:05:54] <deed02392> this closure concept looks awesome
[13:06:37] <chilversc> though it does matter the order in which jquery vs the CMS is loaded
[13:06:57] <chilversc> and since jquery's $ is being overwrote, I'd guess the CMS' scripts are loaded after jquery?
[13:11:11] <djQuery> chilversc: most likely
[13:12:56] <muay-guy> hello, how can I get my site's base url with jquery?
[13:14:27] <chilversc> muay-guy: document.domain is probably what you want
[13:14:29] <jonee> hmm you can make php output to javascript muay-guy
[13:14:42] <ElCapitanMarklar> muay-guy - you can get it from window.location.host
[13:14:54] <muay-guy> cool. thanks
[13:15:04] <ElCapitanMarklar> theres a few other bits and bobs in the window.location object that are useful too.
[13:15:06] <chilversc> though they don't contain the protocol used
[13:15:47] <chilversc> ah, document.location.origin
[13:16:17] <grid_> hey
[13:16:23] <ElCapitanMarklar> document.location.protocol too i believe
[13:16:31] <ElCapitanMarklar> window. sorry
[13:17:23] <chilversc> never quite known which one I'm supposed to be using, document.location or window.location

[14:12:48] <DukeDrake> oh, you're toggling ...
[14:13:06] <DukeDrake> this function seems just too complecated
[14:13:44] <DukeDrake> if toggling is involved, there should only be one function to alter the state ... not a seperate function for each state ...
[14:15:27] <DukeDrake> still there?
[14:17:22] <ajpiano> Assimilater: just took a quick look at your paste before i step out
[14:17:25] <ajpiano> but this is a problem:
[14:17:29] <ajpiano>         if ($(this).attr('dir', 'ASC')) {
[14:17:39] <ajpiano> you're doing a test of the setter, so it always falls into the first case
[14:17:47] <DukeDrake> heh
[14:17:49] <ajpiano> i think you mean if ($(this).attr("dir") == "ASC")) {}
[14:17:53] <ajpiano> but DukeDrake is right
[14:18:09] <ajpiano> you should make the toggle function smart enough so you don't have to do two separate binds depending on the button's initial state
[14:18:14] <DukeDrake> Also, you're parsing an initial state: no need to toggle there at all.
[14:20:14] <Assimilater> ajpiano: go figure it's something silly like htat :S
[14:20:26] <imsky> amy's dead
[14:20:33] <Assimilater> DukeDrake: the toggle is for when the button gets clicked
[14:20:57] <ajpiano> Assimilater: i have been meaning to show you how to DRY up this code for a couple days
[14:21:02] <ajpiano> i'm gonnna do that and then roll out :)
[14:22:22] <DukeDrake> there :} http://jsfiddle.net/2gQwN/1/
[14:22:37] <Assimilater> ajpiano: dry up?
[14:22:39] <DukeDrake> what's option doing, anyway?
[14:22:54] <ajpiano> ?dry @ Assimilater
[14:22:55] <bot-t> Assimilater, DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself. http://goo.gl/xwCA
[14:23:32] <DukeDrake> Assimilater: if you're using a conditional, there's no need for another state check like a toggle: you already know what you want to do
[14:23:42] <ajpiano> DukeDrake: he needs to flip it when it's clicked
[14:24:05] <DukeDrake> yes: but either use a conditional OR a toggle ...
[14:24:53] <Assimilater> DukeDrake: so you'd suggest replacing if-toggle with click?
[14:25:09] <DukeDrake> ?
[14:25:24] <DukeDrake> did you take look at my update?
[14:25:27] <Assimilater> clikc-if*
[14:25:44] <Assimilater> typing failure....
[14:30:38] <egeste> I am including an iframe in a page from my own domain, and I want to get the content of that iframe. I'm using $(iframe).contents - but that returns a jquery object - I just want the textual, string content of the object, how can I solicit that?
[14:30:38] <DukeDrake> $(this).toggle() actually binds a toggle function to the element?
[14:31:07] <DukeDrake> egeste: try html() or text()
[14:31:12] <egeste> thanks
[14:33:00] <ajpiano> Assimilater: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/2gQwN/4/
[14:34:25] <DukeDrake> ah, it does ....
[14:34:34] <egeste> DukeDrake: I get null on .html() and blank on .text()
[14:34:49] <ajpiano> DukeDrake: yeah... but it's often a little neater to just use click
[14:34:50] <DukeDrake> :/
[14:34:55] <ajpiano> and actually track the state
[14:35:08] <ajpiano> as opposed to just assuming things will work right because the order of the events
[14:35:17] <egeste> http://pastebin.com/yUW28L4y
[14:35:24] * DukeDrake carefully pushes egeste in ajpano direction
[14:35:41] <ajpiano> Assimilater: tracking something that can only have two states using the strings instead of using a boolean means you have to write a lot of code
[14:36:19] <ajpiano> egeste: try uh, .contents().find("body").html()
[14:36:25] <ajpiano> contents returns a window object
[14:36:26] <jbrokc> how do i use animate effects on the same selector simultaeously?
[14:36:29] <egeste> it's not returning html
[14:36:29] <ajpiano> or document or something
[14:36:32] <egeste> it's returning json
[14:36:36] <ajpiano> wat
[14:36:43] <wib> How can I match an attribute from a variable?
[14:36:45] <ajpiano> iframes don't return things
[14:36:54] <egeste> WELL
[14:36:56] <egeste> oops caps
[14:37:01] <DukeDrake> hehe
[14:37:07] <egeste> it's loading a page that is displaying a json object
[14:37:10] <DukeDrake> wib: what do you mean?
[14:37:13] <egeste> ie, [[thing], [thing]]
[14:37:31] <ajpiano> so get the text() and then parse it as JSON
[14:37:41] <egeste> text() shows up as blank
[14:37:44] <wib> DukeDrake: like, I have a couple of inputfields that I want to match against an object.
[14:37:49] <egeste> however if I display the iframe, I see the json string
[14:37:56] <ajpiano> did you do .find("body").text()
[14:37:57] <ajpiano> ??
[14:38:10] <egeste> no, var data = $('#omegleListener').contents().text();
[14:38:15] <ajpiano> right
[14:38:16] <wib> DukeDrake: I want a couple of <option>'s to be selected by default
[14:38:19] <ajpiano> so read the words that i am saying
[14:38:27] <wib> DukeDrake: depending on the users choice
[14:38:30] <ajpiano> where you have to go get the body because contents is not something that has innerText
[14:38:38] <DukeDrake> wib: well .. you can get the value of an input field with .val() ... but that will provide a string ... not too sure about how to match an object with anything :/
[14:39:00] <DukeDrake> ?val
[14:39:00] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[14:39:16] <ajpiano> wib:  if you want to find if an arbitrary string is the key name of a property on an object
[14:39:24] <ajpiano> you can just do if (obj[stringvar]) { }
[14:39:32] <wib> DukeDrake: let's make it clear, I have one select with a bunch of options. and the user have a cookie stored with the value of the option to be selected in the next page-load
[14:39:38] <DukeDrake> ajpiano: cool
[14:39:54] <ajpiano> Assimilater: did you get a chance to look at that, cause i'm about to roll and i don't want you to feel abandoned :)
[14:40:06] <jbrokc> i'm having trouble getting my animations to run at the same time. can someone look at my gist? https://gist.github.com/92d42bdae345df7000c4 /cc ajpiano
[14:40:11] <egeste> ajpiano, I'm sorry I'm not understanding what you're trying to get me to understand. Could you please phrase it differently?
[14:40:13] <DukeDrake> wib: then you need to add the selected attribut to the specific index of the option
[14:40:25] <ajpiano> egeste: $(iframe).contents().find("body").text()
[14:40:35] <wib> DukeDrake: yes, and how do I match the user's value with my select's option?
[14:40:36] <egeste> ajpiano: there is no body element
[14:40:52] <DukeDrake> ajpiano: just a last yes or no question: is it possible to iterate a json obejct? e.g. throw out key-> value pairs?
[14:40:54] <ajpiano> ffuu
[14:40:56] <wib> So I know which one to select by default.
[14:41:00] <ajpiano> DukeDrake: of course
[14:41:15] <ajpiano> for (var k in JSON.parse(jsonstring)) { }
[14:41:20] <DukeDrake> hah!
[14:41:22] <DukeDrake> thanx =D
[14:41:35] <egeste> ajpiano: the content of the iframe has no html markup, no body element, no html element.
[14:41:58] <ajpiano> egeste: if you do console.dir($("iframe").contents()[0])
[14:42:08] <ajpiano> and check out what is inside that object... does anything useful turn up
[14:42:09] <Assimilater> ajpiano: sorry, didn't notice the flashing pidgen
[14:42:14] <Assimilater> '$(this),'?
[14:42:15] <egeste> ajpiano: I will try, hold on
[14:42:20] <ajpiano> i would make at test case and look but i have to leave
[14:42:21] <Assimilater> otherwise ya, i see what you're saying
[14:42:22] <DukeDrake> wib: can you alert() the users value? i.e. put it in a variable?
[14:42:29] <ajpiano> Assimilater: hum ?
[14:42:35] <Assimilater> line 5
[14:42:42] <Assimilater> var $this = $(this),
[14:42:49] <ajpiano> yeah
[14:42:49] <egeste> ajpiano: undefined
[14:42:57] <wib> DukeDrake: I have it in an object and can call it by "obj.first"
[14:42:59] <Assimilater> what's the comma for?
[14:43:06] <Assimilater> i was expecting like a semicolon
[14:43:09] <ajpiano> Assimilater: comma delimited var declaration
[14:43:11] <DukeDrake> $('#myselect[value='+uservalue+']).attr('selected','true'); or something ...
[14:43:24] <Assimilater> ajpiano: oh....weird i'm not used to seeing that in javascript, lol
[14:43:24] <ajpiano> Assimilater: you can do var foo = "bar"; var baz = "bat";
[14:43:32] <ajpiano> or you can do ... var foo = "bar", baz ="bat"
[14:43:33] <ajpiano> ok
[14:43:34] <ajpiano> yeah
[14:43:50] <ajpiano> egeste: what is $(iframe).contents().length ?
[14:43:56] <Assimilater> ajpiano: thanks, looks good :)
[14:44:13] <ajpiano> Assimilater:  ok hope it learns you something
[14:44:15] <ajpiano> :)
[14:44:32] <DukeDrake> wip: erm ... there were ... some ... errors in my line ... it's just meant as a hint ^^
[14:44:49] <wib> DukeDrake: thanks, will try out..
[14:44:51] <egeste> ajpiano: 0
[14:45:00] <ajpiano> egeste: that's not good news
[14:45:16] <ajpiano> you have an iframe src="somethingthatreturnsjson"
[14:45:26] <ajpiano> ?
[14:45:30] <egeste> yes
[14:45:37] <ajpiano> i have never heard of anyone trying that
[14:45:46] <ajpiano> some kinda xdomain hack?
[14:45:57] <egeste> seriously? it's just a string like any other
[14:45:58] * DukeDrake hands egeste the magical book of ajax
[14:46:05] <egeste> jquery cant understand it because it's not DOM?
[14:46:18] <egeste> I would use AJAX, but I need to make asynchronoous...
[14:46:20] <egeste> nevermind
[14:46:24] <ajpiano> huh
[14:46:26] <egeste> ill hack it out
[14:46:29] <ajpiano> AJAX *is* asynchronous
[14:46:43] <egeste> I need to make more than one request at a time, while other requests are pending
[14:46:55] <ajpiano> you can do that with ajax
[14:47:11] <egeste> I would liek to see how, since I cant get my browser to do it
[14:47:18] <DukeDrake> egeste: I beleive you can spanw multiple simultanous requests ....
[14:47:34] <egeste> yes, but as far as I can tell, multiple ajax requests act like a queue
[14:47:38] <egeste> first in first out
[14:47:44] <ajpiano> that is the opposite of true
[14:47:52] <egeste> docs please?
[14:47:59] <tristan-> hey i'm trying to add an href to an image that's been fancyboxed, but the console is returning a null object when i try to target the id of the image that gets loaded
[14:48:01] <DukeDrake> Wanted to provide my fileserver with the possibility to start the next upload while the first is still running ... >.>
[14:48:11] <ajpiano> can you point me to the docs that suggest that it *does* act like a queue?
[14:48:14] <DukeDrake> ?ajax
[14:48:15] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:48:32] <tristan-> so, idea would be you click the image, it lightboxes to full, and then an href gets appended to the image so if you click it it takes you somewhere..
[14:48:37] <egeste> ok , since I am obviously causing confusion, please allow me to clarify
[14:48:41] <egeste> brb, im going to write this out
[14:48:55] <grid_> i want to search a combobox with bookmark options, after you select a value from this combobox you can bookmark it with a push button, this should popup a bookmark dialog from the browser bookmark dialog, can anybody help me? i wanted to use this with the jquery ui autocomplete demom for example
[14:49:40] <DukeDrake> tristan-: at least in lightbox, there are _several_ layers in front of the image to be able to navigate forward and backward....
[14:49:42] <tristan-> http://dpaste.com/575709/
[14:50:06] <tristan-> duke, i'm trying to target the actual img that the fb is creating
[14:50:17] <tristan-> but the console is returning an empty thing
[14:50:38] <DukeDrake> tristan-: aside from the fact that you need an actual anchor element _around_ the <img>-element to get a "linked image"
[14:50:44] <tristan-> yea
[14:50:46] <tristan-> .wrap
[14:50:51] <tristan-> look at the pastie?
[14:51:17] <DukeDrake> tristan-: try to console.log the classes of the clicked element and try from there
[14:51:27] <DukeDrake> tristan-: no time :/
[14:51:32] <tristan-> it's 4 lines ;(
[14:51:32] <tristan-> ok
[14:51:35] <egeste> I have a javascript application in which I am listening for events on a url (url.php?action=listen) - this script has a very high timeout and will basically just wait and wait and wait until it receives an event, then it will print the event(s) as a json string, then terminate (eof). When I start an ajax request to this url, it acts as expected (waiting until eof before it returns). the problem is that if I want to make a subsequent request whil
[14:52:08] <DukeDrake> tristan-: do you understand, what I meant by "layers in front of the image"?  e.g. z-index and stuff?
[14:52:39] <tristan-> yep
[14:52:45] <DukeDrake> ok
[14:52:48] <tristan-> i'm trying to target the img id that gets generated
[14:53:14] <tristan-> i need to fire it as a funciton i think in a callback of the fb method
[14:53:19] <DukeDrake> yes ... but if you click the image ... there could be a transparent layer in front of it?
[14:53:20] <tristan-> onComplete: loadUrl() or something
[14:53:29] <tristan-> it's not returning the object
[14:53:31] <tristan-> in the console
[14:53:32] <tristan-> that's the issue.
[14:53:53] <egeste> ajpiano: see above please
[14:55:15] <eniac> does .bind attach events to handlers for element that exists now and in the future or only now ?
[14:55:50] <DukeDrake> not sure
[14:56:27] <eniac> From the docs (which mention nothing about it) I understand it doesn't work for elements in the future.
[14:56:30] <ajpiano> egeste: just working on something that will show you it's possible
[14:57:39] <eniac> I like .bind because you can pass eventData which is what I need.
[14:57:50] <eniac> .live doesn't support passing custom eventData.
[14:58:41] <tristan-> duke: got it.
[14:59:34] <eniac> ooh .live does support eventData, sorry!
[15:00:15] <DukeDrake> tristan-: heh ... tell me =D
[15:01:28] <ajpiano> egeste: sorry if this doesn't address your specific use case, but it demonstrates that there is no such thing as FIFO ajax requests...you can have an arbitrary amount of requests pending and finishing at any time
[15:01:30] <ajpiano> egeste http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/CuNKS/
[15:12:42] <egeste> ajpiano: that doesnt address my issue at all... I see what you were trying to do, but my problem is not illustrated there
[15:13:40] <ajpiano> egeste: if your server locks the file or something while it's being read and then you request it again
[15:13:53] <ajpiano> or anything else that's particularly unique about your situation
[15:13:59] <ajpiano> there could be something specific
[15:14:09] <ajpiano> but in general, jquery has no limitationson ajax like what you described
[15:14:17] <ajpiano> anyhow i have to get going, good luck
[15:14:20] <egeste> thanks

[16:25:12] <isarl> this is line 281 of dracula_graph.js, the offending code: https://github.com/strathausen/dracula/blob/master/js/dracula_graph.js#L281

[16:25:32] <isarl> (I think)
[16:26:16] <isarl> I'm not the author of Dracula, so I'm not exactly sure what's going on, and since I'm also a newbie to JS and jQuery, my debugging skills are still, shall we sayâ€¦ limited
[16:26:20] <eddiemonge> have you tried adding a breakpoint and stepping through the code?
[16:27:42] <isarl> yes, but as I'm not particularly familiar with Dracula's implementation, I wasn't really sure what was going on..
[16:28:04] <GoGoGarrett> I am trying to manage an image gallery and maintain their aspect ratio for a client, so they can easily update/change the images.  Is there anyway to do this without having to setup a full-blown cms
[16:29:38] <eddiemonge> isarl: maybe you should check with the people who wrote dracula since it seems like the problem might be there
[16:30:09] <isarl> yes, I've sent the developer an email
[16:30:15] <eddiemonge> GoGoGarrett: do what? update/change the images?
[16:30:27] <isarl> thanks anyway, eddiemonge
[16:30:29] <GoGoGarrett> Yeah, they're wanting to update new images to their portfillo

[16:32:09] <djQuery> isarl: instead of emailin the developer try adding a ticket to the github. if you can see ?demo
[16:32:10] <bot-t> isarl, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:33:50] <eddiemonge> GoGoGarrett: so you want all the pictures the same size but keeping their current aspect ratio? from pictures that are different sizes?
[16:38:36] <GoGoGarrett> Idealy yeah
[16:38:48] <GoGoGarrett> i'm guessing i'd have to crop a thumbnail from the retrieved picture
[16:39:36] <eddiemonge> yeah, unless you are cropping the images, what you described is impossible unless you can warp reality
[16:53:10] <isarl> Okay, here's a working example: http://jsfiddle.net/g5pEU/
[16:54:16] <isarl> In reality, "children" comes from an AJAX request serving me some JSON, but that's working properly in my app, and this code runs into the same problem without throwing AJAX into the mix.
[16:58:01] <CannedCorn> hey guys, i'm animating the height increase of a text input field and the text stays centered vertically within the input
[16:58:05] <CannedCorn> is there a way to avoid that
[16:59:43] <CannedCorn> or maybe you guys could point me to a way to do this like google+ does it?
[16:59:56] <CannedCorn> I'm trying to get that style of input box
[17:03:56] <eddiemonge> use a textarea and not input
[17:05:33] <CannedCorn> ok
[17:05:58] <CannedCorn> but its a form, is that ok?
[17:06:39] <eddiemonge> yes. new to html?
[17:06:48] <CannedCorn> no just forgetting the rules :-)
[17:06:53] <CannedCorn> it's been a while
[17:07:19] <CannedCorn> so can you use text area as part of a form?
[17:07:46] <eddiemonge> yes. its a form element
[17:08:10] <CannedCorn> ok cool
[17:10:11] <CannedCorn> thanks eddiemonge
[17:28:33] <CannedCorn> if i have a button and a text area in a form and i want them to be vertically aligned
[17:28:37] <CannedCorn> how do i go about doing that
[17:30:08] <j_wright> sounds like a css question?

[17:58:59] <dAnjou> i used the code for another project and there it works
[17:59:14] <dAnjou>  i have absolutly no idea why it does not work here
[18:02:24] <glen1> dAnjou, ill have a look at it
[18:02:58] <glen1> it works on jsfiddle
[18:03:35] <dAnjou> wtf
[18:03:53] <glen1> dAnjou, oh wait
[18:03:55] <dAnjou> then something's wrong here with the browser
[18:04:06] <glen1> when I swap some numbers it copies them all. ill take a screenie
[18:04:54] <glen1> the dropdown results for to --1 -- / -- 1 -- / -- 1 -- for each one
[18:05:00] <glen1> im guessing thats not the results u want haha
[18:05:15] <dAnjou> but at least it does *something*
[18:05:17] <glen1> $("#areas").selectOptions is not a function
[18:05:17] <glen1> [Break On This Error] $("#areas").selectOptions(x);
[18:05:21] <glen1> i get that error
[18:05:27] <dAnjou> here it does nothing at all
[18:05:41] <glen1> try in firefox
[18:05:52] <dAnjou> glen1: oh yes, i forgot to include a library
[18:05:55] <dAnjou> that's ok
[18:06:07] <jbrokc> anyone here know if i'ts possible to bind backspace to the document on mac os x using https://github.com/jeresig/jquery.hotkeys ? reason i ask is becasue backspace keeps going back in history for me in the browser, but this worked for me before...
[18:06:11] <dAnjou> but that's not the error i get
[18:07:08] <dAnjou> it works in fx .. damnit
[18:07:24] <glen1> haha i know ur pain
[18:07:26] <dAnjou> F***
[18:07:51] <glen1> whats the selectOptions error about
[18:07:58] <dAnjou> glen1: you know the other project is running in the same chromium and it works
[18:08:08] <glen1> i hate shit like that
[18:08:24] <glen1> delete ur cache refresh
[18:08:24] <dAnjou> glen1: this function is defined in another file. i forgot to include it.
[18:08:34] <glen1> copy the exact same code, anything to get it workin
[18:09:30] <glen1> jbrokc, i havent used that before but would return false somewhere in the code work as it does with clicking links?
[18:12:03] <jbrokc> glen1: well, i haven't touched that function call at all since it was working so i'm going to just use the debugger / comment out a lot of uninvolved code to see where it goes wrong. now, how can i get the current object in focus?
[18:12:38] <nore> hi everybody!
[18:13:17] <glen1> in focus? idk what you mean but I use console.log(wasever) for debugging
[18:15:03] <nore> content of a page is loaded by ajax. When I wonna do some action on the new content, it's still working on the old page content. My question is what is the name of this problem? load, delay? I just wonna learn further
[18:16:01] <glen1> wouldnt the old content be loaded by the time you play with the new stuff?
[18:17:24] <nore> apparently, functions are being called before dom is completely changed
[18:18:13] <dAnjou> glen1: now it should work for you http://jsfiddle.net/gRYNZ/3/
[18:18:28] <glen1> hmm do you use $(document).ready(function() {
[18:18:28] <glen1>   // Handler for .ready() called.
[18:18:28] <glen1> });
[18:19:10] <glen1> dAnjou, are u only meant to be left with 3 different numbers?
[18:19:21] <nore> when i execute several functions, i expect they will be executed in order.  But, I think, some of them start before the previous ones stop
[18:19:23] <glen1> if I play around with it, a duplicate appears which deletes one other number
[18:19:32] <nore> yes, i use document.ready
[18:19:55] <dAnjou> glen1: it should just swap the options
[18:20:29] <dAnjou> duplicates would be strange
[18:20:40] <glen1> dAnjou, is all your trying to do is swap them around?
[18:21:48] <dAnjou> yes
[18:22:18] <dAnjou> it works here in fx
[18:22:23] <glen1> seems like a lot of code just for that, tho i might be underestimating
[18:23:14] <glen1> dAnjou, select 2 options then hit the up or down buttons a few times
[18:23:17] <dAnjou> glen1: the whole selecting thing i much code, but i didn't write it
[18:24:16] <dAnjou> glen1: oh, you found a bug
[18:24:17] <dAnjou> thanks
[18:24:34] <dAnjou> but it's just one condition to fix it
[18:24:48] <glen1> thats good i guess lol
[18:25:09] <dAnjou> at the moment it drives me crazy that it doesn't work in chromium
[18:25:13] <dAnjou> shit
[18:26:09] <glen1> works for me in chrome
[18:26:26] <dAnjou> well yes, in "my" chromium
[18:27:31] <djQuery> lotta work when see ?ui.sortable woulda probably done it
[18:27:31] <bot-t> The jQuery UI Sortable plugin makes selected elements sortable by dragging with the mouse. http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[18:28:23] <dAnjou> djQuery: thanks, but i think they have a *lot* more code :P
[18:32:33] <Mrfloyd> Who has jqtouch experience
[18:32:34] <Mrfloyd> ?
[18:32:45] <Mrfloyd> how can make the images tappable
[18:32:46] <Mrfloyd> ?
[18:41:38] <dAnjou> djQuery: maybe i should use their sortable. it seems stable. thanks
[18:41:40] <lenswipe> hey guys
[18:42:03] <lenswipe> im using CKEditor and when i edit a blogpost its putting the post in <blockquote> - anyone know how to stop this happening?
[18:42:43] <glen1> dAnjou,
[18:42:49] <dAnjou> why do you ask that here?
[18:42:53] <dAnjou> @ lenswipe
[18:42:56] <glen1> try this out
[18:43:00] <lenswipe> where do you suggest i ask it?
[18:43:07] <lenswipe> since #ckeditor doesnt exist
[18:43:15] <dAnjou> lenswipe: ckeditor support?
[18:43:25] <glen1> dam jsfiddle wiped it
[18:43:38] <lenswipe> since im using the jquery adapter (and alot of people in here will have done the same) i figured this might be the most appropriate place
[18:43:58] <djQuery> lenswipe: sure there are some options for it
[18:44:05] <lenswipe> which ones?
[18:44:08] <lenswipe> how do i turn it off?
[18:44:10] <lenswipe> its annoying
[18:45:12] <dAnjou> glen1: you have to save it first ^^
[18:45:14] <djQuery> lenswipe: http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Developers_Guide/FCKeditor_CKEditor_Configuration_Mapping
[18:45:26] <fg> f
[18:45:35] <lenswipe> djQuery, ?
[18:46:47] <Sonja> is there a nice chart of which browser version supports which version of ecmascript?
[18:46:55] <dAnjou> fg: sixth letter of the alphabet
[18:47:51] <glen1> dAnjou, http://jsfiddle.net/ntfYG/1/
[18:48:36] <djQuery> glen1: if you have all 3 highlighted it adds an extra option
[18:49:20] <glen1> djQuery oh I thought u could only hilight one at a time, that was a waste of time lol
[18:49:35] <dAnjou> Sonja: 1 min googling http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#Version_correspondence
[18:49:41] <glen1> brb
[18:49:47] <djQuery> glen1: seeing as how he has multiple  defined on the select
[18:50:15] <Sonja> dAnjou: yes i saw that page. it doest tell me which version of chrome supports which version of JS, for example
[18:50:28] <Sonja> i guess it's only FF and IE
[18:51:41] <djQuery> http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/
[18:51:48] <Sonja> coool
[18:51:49] <Sonja> oh and http://www.quirksmode.org/compatibility.html
[18:52:43] <djQuery> Sonja: http://html5test.com/results.html
[18:52:47] <dAnjou> glen1: i need multiple selections
[18:53:23] <djQuery> dAnjou: what are u trying to accomplish exactly?
[18:53:45] <glen1> danjou my bad
[18:56:07] <dAnjou> djQuery: actually it's just some crappy frontend for .. how do i say .. semester work(?)
[18:56:56] <dAnjou> djQuery: i have some images (1, 2 and 3). they are layers.
[18:57:23] <dAnjou> by selecting i want to show them, be de-selecting hide them
[18:57:45] <dAnjou> and sorting them should .. well sort them
[18:58:34] <dAnjou> i will use the jquery ui sortable and hook up into the update event
[18:58:43] <dAnjou> seems to be the easiest way
[19:00:58] <dAnjou> damn, the sun rises .. i'll go t bed
[19:01:11] <dAnjou> thanks for your assitance glen1 and djQuery
[19:03:10] <physpeters> Is it possible to send an AJAX request in multiple parts? i.e. send part of the request, wait for some kind of confirmation that it was sent, then send more, etc.?
[19:04:26] <djQuery> sure nested in the success of each one
[19:05:01] <physpeters> I mean, all in one HTTP request.
[19:08:59] <eddiemonge> well then its not multiple parts
[19:10:12] <eddiemonge> physpeters: what is the end goal of what you want to do?
[19:10:41] <physpeters> pushing a long stream of data as the request without eating up a bunch of memory.
[19:11:05] <physpeters> the idea is that the whole string shouldn't be in the memory at once
[19:11:52] <eddiemonge> how big is the stream?
[19:12:01] <physpeters> arbitrarily large
[19:12:12] <eddiemonge> why?
[19:12:22] <physpeters> why does it matter?
[19:12:45] <eddiemonge> sometimes people do things that are silly when they could be doing it a lot simpler
[19:13:19] <physpeters> I know what I'm doing
[19:13:42] <eddiemonge> then what are you asking?
[19:13:56] <physpeters> if it's possible to open a long-running AJAX request
[19:14:42] <eddiemonge> it kind of sounds like you dont know what you are doing. what is the data you are trying to send?
[19:15:44] <physpeters> It's base64 encoded file data, which is generated on the client side, not directly from the user's HD (so a direct <input type=file> upload is not a solution).
[19:16:19] <eddiemonge> and you cant just send it one request?
[19:16:28] <eddiemonge> or send a smaller data set?
[19:16:47] <physpeters> no.
[19:17:16] <Mrfloyd> guys i am going nuts
[19:17:29] <Mrfloyd> where i can get help with jqtouch
[19:18:22] <eddiemonge> you could ask here but jqtouch is a beast
[19:19:17] <Mrfloyd> i cant get tap working
[19:19:17] <Mrfloyd> on an img , div
[19:19:17] <Mrfloyd> only a tags
[19:19:17] <Mrfloyd> my environment is ios webview
[19:19:18] <Mrfloyd> what did u mean by beast?
[19:23:01] <eddiemonge> do you have example code? are you using phonegap or native webview?
[19:23:36] <Mrfloyd> phonegao
[19:23:36] <Mrfloyd> pg*
[19:23:36] <Mrfloyd> i will arrange the code and paste a sample
[19:23:36] <Mrfloyd> thanks 1 sec
[19:23:55] <eddiemonge> you might have to check with phonegap. i know things dont always work right when using it
[19:26:19] <Mrfloyd> have a look
[19:26:20] <Mrfloyd> http://pastebin.com/66d8c1Lp
[19:26:26] <Mrfloyd> i am sure it not about phonegap
[19:26:34] <Mrfloyd> i will check in safari mobile
[19:27:01] <Mrfloyd> i traced the code  jqtouch is assuming that each tap element should have an href
[19:27:01] <Mrfloyd> attr
[19:27:27] <Dreamer3> returning false breaks each?
[19:27:33] <eddiemonge> have you tried doing a normal click instead of tap?
[19:27:34] <Dreamer3> is that correct?
[19:27:45] <Mrfloyd> onClick attr
[19:27:46] <Mrfloyd> ?
[19:27:48] <eddiemonge> Dreamer3: it exits the current function
[19:27:52] <Mrfloyd> or using live
[19:28:11] <eddiemonge> .live('click') or .click()
[19:28:41] <Dreamer3> uh
[19:28:46] <Dreamer3> but shouldn't it still be called for each item
[19:29:01] <Dreamer3> it' slike if one loop returns flase it bails
[19:29:06] <Dreamer3> oh
[19:29:06] <ajpiano> Dreamer3: yes
[19:29:09] <Dreamer3> guess it's a feature
[19:29:10] <ajpiano> return false breaks an each loop
[19:29:14] <Dreamer3> "We can stop the loop from within the callback function by returning false."
[19:29:15] <ajpiano> return true is like continue;
[19:29:52] <Mrfloyd> eddiemonge:  no cigar
[19:29:52] <Mrfloyd> same log
[19:30:12] <eddiemonge> no idea then. im not too familiar with jqtouch
[19:30:15] <Mrfloyd> http://pastebin.com/qUapSAjL
[19:30:25] <Mrfloyd> that's drove me nuts
[19:30:39] <Mrfloyd> i will roll back
[19:30:41] <Mrfloyd> and see
[19:30:58] <Mrfloyd> it was working but i dont feel much in control and it scares
[19:36:49] <eddiemonge> i dont know. is jqtouch still even based on jquery?
[19:38:43] <eddiemonge> physpeters: why cant you send the values used to generate whatever it is back to the server and have it do it?
[19:39:26] <physpeters> the server API is fixed. Stupid reason, I know, but I can't really do anything about it.
[19:40:53] <physpeters> eddiemonge: I'm not looking for a workaround, I'm wondering if it's possible :p
[19:41:22] <physpeters> and it sounds like it's not
[19:43:25] <Mrfloyd> eddiemonge: yes it is jquery plugin
[19:48:21] <eddiemonge> Mrfloyd: have you looked at jquery mobile yet?
[19:48:27] <Mrfloyd> yes
[19:48:34] <Mrfloyd> too heavy
[19:48:45] <Mrfloyd> i think xui is the best for phonegap
[19:49:15] <Mrfloyd> jquery mobile is a bit rigide
[19:49:38] <Mrfloyd> u know what i mean?
[19:50:41] <eddiemonge> not really no. and im very interested in your feedback about jqm
[19:51:21] <Mrfloyd> mm
[19:51:22] <chipy> hola
[19:51:33] <Mrfloyd> one of the things i didnt like that jqm adds the classes and modify the html
[19:51:40] <Mrfloyd> based on the theming logic it has
[19:52:11] <eddiemonge> yeah, thats one of the selling points. it tries to create a consistent look and feel across all the devices/platforms
[19:52:22] <Mrfloyd> yes
[19:52:48] <Mrfloyd> when adding the html at run time
[19:53:22] <Mrfloyd> i wasnt able to know how to re apply this
[19:53:33] <eddiemonge> you could use your own theme though
[19:53:39] <Mrfloyd> yes
[19:53:50] <Mrfloyd> i loved the events
[19:53:57] <Mrfloyd> the page events etc..
[19:54:27] <Mrfloyd> i am the kind of guys who like to do it all in my hand
[19:54:37] <Mrfloyd> all i am looking for is some descent touch events
[19:55:20] <Mrfloyd> but what i want to tell you
[19:55:27] <Mrfloyd> i am not sure if i m making myself clear
[19:55:39] <Mrfloyd> if u are using a templating technic
[19:55:46] <Mrfloyd> u r grabbing json from the server
[19:55:57] <Mrfloyd> and building the html at run time and adding it
[19:56:00] <Mrfloyd> the theme is not being applied
[19:56:02] <Mrfloyd> got me
[19:56:03] <Mrfloyd> ?
[19:56:57] <eddiemonge> then just use the touch events
[19:57:24] <Mrfloyd> any light version that has the touch events only
[19:57:24] <Mrfloyd> ?
[19:57:59] <Mrfloyd> you guys should consider adding a method to reapply the theme
[19:58:04] <Mrfloyd> on an fragment
[19:58:13] <Mrfloyd> that;s what i would suggest
[19:58:17] <Mrfloyd> after the page loads
[19:58:47] <eddiemonge> look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.vmouse.js
[19:58:50] <eddiemonge> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.event.js
[19:59:58] <djQuery> wonder when the ui 1.9 release date is coming?
[20:01:16] <Mrfloyd> ok
[20:01:19] <Mrfloyd> cool
[20:02:49] <Mrfloyd> does it support live
[20:02:51] <Mrfloyd> ?
[20:06:44] <djQuery> having a little problem with this      $.each(this.Tables(), function(i,elm){ if(elm.id() > ntid){ ntid = elm.id()+1; } });
[20:07:08] <djQuery> it works fine the 1st time but the 2nd time it will return the same as the first time its run.
[20:07:47] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/evuxav/12/edit click on add table twice and you will notice that it comes up with the same # the 2nd time
[20:08:33] <djQuery> there added a console.log for it as well http://jsbin.com/evuxav/13/edit
[20:10:01] <ajpiano> is this.Tables really a function
[20:10:31] <djQuery> der der <= instead of <
[20:10:40] <ajpiano> also you added a constole log ;)
[20:10:44] <ajpiano> not a conosle log :D
[20:10:51] <djQuery> thanks
[20:11:44] <djQuery> knockout.js rocks
[20:11:53] <zulax> is this possible in jquery, $("#mydiv"+myVar).html();
[20:11:57] <zulax> the myVar part?
[20:12:20] <djQuery> zulax: yes thats possible.
[20:12:32] <zulax> awesome :)
[20:14:47] <ajpiano> ?concatobj @ zulax
[20:14:47] <bot-t> zulax, You cannot concatenate an object to a string, which is what you're trying to do with $(this + " selector"). If you want to use an element reference as the context for a search, use $(this).find("elem") or $("elem",this).
[20:15:04] <ajpiano> but if myVar is a string, yes, it will work find
[20:15:16] <zulax> yes, for me it worked fine as it was a var
[20:15:33] <zulax> need some cocept here,
[20:15:49] <zulax> so i have to keep updating a div until the content is 0
[20:16:10] <zulax> means i have to have timer but it should be dynamic, i.e if not 0 then continue fetch, if 0 stop timer
[20:17:24] <zulax> I must have a js that continually checks the content, dont i?
[20:17:45] <zulax> and that continuous script will fire up another timer depending on the content?
[20:18:00] <ajpiano> yea, i am gonna make a demo if you want
[20:18:31] <zulax> well I will ask if I need help, but is my concept right?
[20:18:40] <ajpiano> pretty mnuch
[20:18:47] <zulax> i must have a continuos timed script no matter what
[20:19:12] <zulax> ok
[20:28:07] <ajpiano> zulax: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/t9j3E/
[20:28:18] <ajpiano> (FYI)
[20:28:49] <zulax> wow, that is super fast
[20:29:21] <ajpiano> well, it takes longer if you put in more time :p
[20:29:41] <zulax> and I have to look thru extensive docs to find answers
[20:30:09] <zulax> so i think i need to use .find but not sure yet how i could get all the divs with prefix "myDiv"
[20:30:17] <zulax> and loop through each
[20:30:18] <ajpiano> ?attributeStartsWith
[20:30:18] <bot-t> [attribute^=value]: Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value beginning exactly with a given string. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[20:30:34] <zulax> thanks
[20:31:43] <zulax> ajpiano, out of curiosity, how long exposure have you had to jquery
[20:32:22] <ajpiano> 3 or 4 yrs
[20:32:54] <zulax> wow
[20:33:40] <zulax> so would it be, $('td[name^="myDiv"]').each(function{});
[20:33:51] <ajpiano> yup
[20:33:59] <zulax> yeah!
[20:34:03] <zulax> that was easy
[20:34:05] <abjorn> c:
[20:34:17] <systemfault> missing () somewhere :P
[20:34:34] <zulax> ye, .each()function{}
[20:36:32] * systemfault cries.
[20:36:43] * ajpiano consoles systemfault
[20:36:53] <systemfault> $('td[name^="myDiv"]').each(function(){}); ;)
[20:37:07] <ajpiano> systemfault: the most important way to use the console is to invoke it as though it was a constructor
[20:37:13] <ajpiano> console("systemfault");
[20:37:13] <ajpiano> :D
[20:37:47] <ajpiano> zulax: systemfault is right though, he's alluding to the fact that a selector like that is subpar
[20:37:56] <ajpiano> it would be ideal for you to be able to put a class onto the elements you want to select
[20:38:09] <systemfault> Or at least set a better context.
[20:38:16] <systemfault> (The second argument)
[20:39:51] <systemfault> I wonder if someone will ever update the bot :P
[20:40:26] <systemfault> ?eval jQuery.fn.jquery
[20:40:27] <bot-t> systemfault: "1.4.2"
[20:40:53] <systemfault> ?eval Object.keys({foo:"bar"});
[20:40:54] <bot-t> systemfault: TypeError: Object.keys is not a function
[20:41:00] <systemfault> :'(
[20:41:47] <ajpiano> systemfault: unfortunately our good friend temp01 who owns bot-t has gone into radio silence over the last couple months
[20:42:15] <systemfault> Ah :P
[20:43:31] <bit0> Hi, is there any jquery function to convert and element to JSON?
[20:44:52] <zulax> ajpiano, http://jsfiddle.net/mF4bM/
[20:45:01] <ajpiano> bit0: there is no way to convert a DOMElement to JSON
[20:45:11] <zulax> i m pretty sure its something minor that i still dont know about
[20:45:33] <ajpiano> zulax: .val() is for setting the value of input elements, a td is not an input element, use .text("g");
[20:45:38] <bit0> ajpiano, sorry.. an array, or several arrays not an object
[20:45:59] <ajpiano> zulax: to use jsFiddle you can include jQuery on the left side and your demo will actually work
[20:46:07] <ajpiano> bit0, see ?stringify
[20:46:07] <bot-t> bit0, JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[20:46:28] <bit0> ajpiano, thanks a lot!!
[20:48:01] * systemfault blames jQuery for not having its own json.stringify :/
[20:48:28] <zulax> still no success ajpiano
[20:48:29] <ajpiano> why should we :)
[20:48:49] <systemfault> For the same reason you have let's say... $.each $.map $.grep
[20:49:12] <systemfault> Take out the browser detection module :P
[20:49:16] <systemfault> And add that :P
[20:50:07] <fourcolors> hi, I'm really struggling with transversing my dom tree on this html. I'm trying to remove the "selected" class from my label and have this so far http://pastie.org/2262023
[20:50:07] <zulax> :( /me dont quite understand
[20:50:08] <systemfault> I blame IE, not really jQuery
[20:50:20] <fourcolors> I've tried to do it many different ways but all seems to fail
[20:50:32] <fourcolors> I need to remove the selected class when the remove button is clicked
[20:50:58] <ajpiano> systemfault: having useful iterators that were needed internally and provide low level utility is different than having a data serializer that we don't use at all
[20:51:59] <gf3> JSON is native in all modern browsers anyhow
[20:52:03] <fourcolors> would anyone be willing to take a look?
[20:52:06] <ajpiano> exactly
[20:52:18] <systemfault> gf3: The problem is... in reality, we must also support shitty browsers.
[20:52:24] <gf3> not me
[20:52:33] <systemfault> Or else.. jQuery wouldn't have its own JSON parser ;)
[20:52:53] <ajpiano> systemfault: we have a json parser because we must parse json responses for the ajax module and did that historically
[20:53:06] <ajpiano> and wanted to improve it from being a simple eval
[20:53:11] <ajpiano> new Function() etc
[20:53:14] <systemfault> I understand
[20:53:29] <systemfault> But now.. it could simply use JSON.parse directly, no?
[20:53:43] <systemfault> jQuery is keeping that for... compatibility?
[20:53:49] <systemfault> (With.. IE)
[20:53:58] <ajpiano> systemfault: it does use JSON.parse directly, if it's available
[20:54:14] <fourcolors> how can I transverse up the dom tree and select the label element and remove a class from it? I was trying with something like $(this).parents("label").removeClass("selected"); but that doesnt' seem to work
[20:54:49] <systemfault> fourcolors: I don't have your code...
[20:55:02] <systemfault> fourcolors: Perhaps try .closest instead of .parents
[20:55:11] <ajpiano> fourcolors: that should work fine, assuming the event is actually firing
[20:55:22] <fourcolors> ya, tried that.. didn't work ..hum.. ill show you html + js one sec
[20:55:38] <systemfault> jsfiddle.net or similar live pastebin.
[20:55:42] <ajpiano> ^^
[20:55:54] <fourcolors> systemfault: http://pastie.org/2262023
[20:55:59] <systemfault> :'(
[20:56:02] <fourcolors> systemfault: does that work?
[20:56:07] <fourcolors> oh .. sorry ill jsfiddle
[20:56:18] <ajpiano> fourcolors: we don't know what 'this' is or whether the event is firing
[20:56:37] <fourcolors> ajpiano: right.. ill include full function one moment.
[20:57:05] <fourcolors> http://pastie.org/2262023
[20:57:08] <fourcolors> ok its updated
[20:57:18] <fourcolors> ill move to js fiddle... one moment
[20:57:36] <zulax> how abt http://jsfiddle.net/mF4bM/2/
[20:57:44] <zulax> this is almost the same example from the api
[20:57:53] <ajpiano> fourcolors: $(this).prev();
[20:58:00] <ajpiano> well actually
[20:58:15] <ajpiano> this closest(".file_photo").children("label");
[20:58:18] <ajpiano> prev won't work
[20:58:26] <ajpiano> $(this).parent().prev() would
[20:59:46] <zulax> oh, its actually working, i was using moo-tools instead of jquery
[20:59:47] <tbranyen> will it?
[21:00:28] <fourcolors> ajpiano: that doesn't seem to be working
[21:00:45] <fourcolors> ajpiano: im not showing any js errors
[21:00:46] <glen1> hey
[21:00:59] <ajpiano> debug
[21:01:07] <ajpiano> fourcolors: you have to traverse usng the relationships that exists
[21:01:11] <ajpiano> if you're at the anchor
[21:01:18] <ajpiano> you have to go up to its parent and then the previous sibling
[21:01:27] <ajpiano> you can debug the restults of these selections in the console
[21:01:37] <fourcolors> ajpiano: I have this         $(this).parent().prev().removeClass("selected");
[21:01:43] <ajpiano> cool story
[21:01:54] <fourcolors> oh... right im using firebug
[21:02:13] <fourcolors> ajpiano: what is the best recommended way to debug in firebug?
[21:02:17] <fourcolors> I mean for this type of situation
[21:02:48] <ajpiano> ?ftj
[21:02:48] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[21:03:15] <ajpiano> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide20
[21:03:24] <zulax> does the attribute selector just work with input elements and not td elements?
[21:03:49] <ajpiano> zulax: no
[21:03:53] <ajpiano> they work on all elements
[21:04:42] <zulax> what would be so wrong in this simplest script http://jsfiddle.net/mF4bM/3/
[21:05:32] <fourcolors> ajpiano: in firebug I created some breakpoints and when I hover over the "parent()" portion it says "Window.new" what is Window.new?
[21:05:41] <ajpiano> wat
[21:05:43] <fourcolors> Looks like it's grabbing the wrong node?
[21:05:45] <ajpiano> that is weird thing to see
[21:05:47] <wpsmith> can anyone help me with a simple jquery issue
[21:05:48] <wpsmith> ?
[21:05:48] <ajpiano> sounds like it
[21:05:53] <wpsmith> http://jsfiddle.net/SAbxU/1/
[21:06:12] <glen1> ajpiano, those slides are good
[21:06:21] <ajpiano> thank you glen1
[21:06:43] <wpsmith> if option page-gridblog.php is selected I want the div#gridblog to appear
[21:07:00] <ajpiano> fourcolors: it's invalid to have a TD that isn't in a tr in a tbody in a a table
[21:07:36] <fourcolors> ajpiano: I don't have a td?
[21:07:45] <ajpiano> yes you do
[21:08:05] <fourcolors> where?
[21:08:17] <wpsmith> http://jsfiddle.net/SAbxU/2/ can anyone help me fix a simple jquery with select?
[21:08:18] <fourcolors> are you looking at js fiddle or the pastie file
[21:08:19] <zulax> that could be me, I have td
[21:08:37] <ajpiano> wpsmith: ummm
[21:08:41] <fourcolors> I think your talking to zulax ajpiano
[21:08:45] <ajpiano> you should be using the change function
[21:08:49] <ajpiano> fourcolors: you might be right
[21:08:58] <ajpiano> zulax: it's invalid to have a TD that isn't in a tr in a tbody in a a table
[21:09:07] <ajpiano> sorry fourcolors :p
[21:09:14] <fourcolors> :p
[21:09:18] <zulax> okay, thanks,
[21:10:10] <zulax> finally it works :) thanks ajpiano
[21:10:31] <wpsmith> ajpiano change function?
[21:10:45] <wpsmith> I've only use jquery once before
[21:10:51] <wpsmith> and this is the code I had
[21:10:52] <wpsmith> :)
[21:12:02] <ajpiano> this code doesn't quite make sense
[21:12:09] <systemfault> ajpiano: One thing I've never been sure of...
[21:12:22] <systemfault> ajpiano: Is <tbody> optional?
[21:12:36] <ajpiano> systemfault: they get inserted automatically no matter what
[21:12:53] <systemfault> Ah ok :)
[21:12:59] <ajpiano> which is why $("#anyTable").chlidren("tr").length will be 0
[21:13:11] <ajpiano> regardless of what you acually write in your html
[21:14:58] <fourcolors> dose anyone know what it means when you get "Window new" in firebug when hovering over an element?
[21:15:11] <wpsmith> ajpiano how do I write if a certain element is selected? http://jsfiddle.net/SAbxU/4/
[21:15:18] <wpsmith> certain option
[21:15:26] <ajpiano> wpsmith: something like this should do the trick http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/SAbxU/8/
[21:16:07] <ajpiano> wpsmith: your thing is saying "every time the select element is clicked, go hide the element, and then MAYBE go show it again, no matter what
[21:16:16] <ajpiano> so no maybe
[21:16:32] <ajpiano> so i don't now how that ever would have worked :p
[21:16:36] <wpsmith> ok
[21:16:44] <ajpiano> the right way to test for the value of a select box is to use the change event and the select val()
[21:18:51] <fourcolors> ajpiano: I found out what I was doing wrong!!!!
[21:19:04] <ajpiano> that is great!!!!
[21:19:15] <glen1> haha
[21:19:16] <fourcolors> ajpiano: I was hiding the $(this).parent() element before I was calling my other code lol
[21:19:34] <fourcolors> I guess you can't do a .hide() and still work on it
[21:19:35] <fourcolors> ugg. .
[21:19:44] <ajpiano> that's not true, you certainly can
[21:19:50] <ajpiano> but if it's hidden... you won't see anything
[21:29:45] <glen1> ajpiano, you know the way bocoup run lectures and stuff. What are they like?
[21:30:05] <glen1> Is it mostly new advanced stuff or from all levels of experience
[21:30:10] <ajpiano> informative :p
[21:30:14] <ajpiano> it depends what the event is
[21:32:41] <glen1>  i was just looking on the site, thought it was cool they would do such a thing :D
[21:32:47] <ajpiano> hehe yea
[21:32:56] <ajpiano> we had the mayor one time
[21:32:57] <ajpiano> :p
[21:33:21] <glen1> was he just strolling around with his giant necklace or key to the city lol
[21:33:28] <tbranyen> p much
[21:33:31] <ajpiano> haha
[21:33:47] <ajpiano> he was there to hack on the wii with tbranyen
[21:35:02] <glen1> woah a hacker mayor
[21:37:08] <glen1> ajpiano, i havent paid much attention to html5 but I have used it. Where is the web going with where html5 is concerned
[21:37:27] <glen1> everytime I google about it, i either get spam or hypey hippo blog posts
[21:37:38] <ajpiano> um
[21:38:18] <glen1> a question from the left field i know haha
[21:38:24] <ajpiano> i think either of those are preferable to my ramblings right now
[21:38:26] <ajpiano> aside from like
[21:39:36] <ajpiano> html5 will allow you to create websites that will make a 7 unicorn orgy on a rainbow look boring by comparison
[21:41:12] <glen1> sadly my imagination cannot go beyond the unicorn orgy
[21:41:24] <yogurt_truck> 7 unicorn orgies are so html4
[21:42:04] <Phelms215> hey guys is there a way to get a parent of an object?
[21:42:30] <ajpiano> an element?
[21:42:36] <ajpiano> $("#whatever").parent();
[21:42:48] <Phelms215> really.. that simple?

[22:07:51] <yogurt_truck> djQuery: lol just now? or has it been like that for a while
[22:09:53] <yogurt_truck> because i think that cloud demo is kinda too cpu-heavy
[22:10:01] <yogurt_truck> going by the sound my mbp started to make after i left that ff tab open for a while
[22:18:36] <postmodern> is there a cleaner way to wrap all non-hr elements together?
[22:26:55] <wpsmith> how do u make jquery check a check box?
[22:27:18] <djQuery> yogurt it would take me a while
[22:27:25] <djQuery> yogurt_truck: ^^
[22:28:16] <djQuery> wpsmith: $('#mycheckbox').prop('checked', true);

[22:30:50] <wpsmith> never mind djQuery got it
[22:42:41] <madprops> what's the best way to make a slideshow?
[23:02:00] <Prometheus> using a plugin
[23:11:48] <codepal> madprops, sometimes making a slideshow involves design skill - so you can include a niche that you want to capture in your images. ( business, shine effects ).
[23:12:25] <codepal> I've been struggling with some business screenshots that I _have_ to make spunky. = not easy at all.
[23:13:37] <madprops> im trying to emulate this slideshow http://tutorialzine.com/2010/09/html5-canvas-slideshow-jquery/  but it doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/frHV5/
[23:16:05] <codepal> madprops, you'll have to check, I'm assuming that jsfiddle doesn't support the new canvas stuff.
[23:16:29] <codepal> madprops, try the zip pack locally, with a browser that you _know_ supports canvas well.
[23:17:08] <madprops> codepal, it doesn't run locally, but it does work in the web demo, which is odd
[23:19:49] <codepal> nice, even works in Opera 11.50.
[23:23:10] <codepal> madprops, very odd that it doesn't work locally - your right, checked in FF5.
[23:24:32] <madprops> codepal, and that's like the only example I've found on the web about doing a slideshow like that
[23:24:46] <madprops> I want to use it to change data dynamically
[23:24:56] <codepal> madprops, doesn't even next previous...
[23:25:14] <codepal> s/next/next or
[23:25:43] <codepal> madprops, don't you have your own online dev webserver?
[23:26:25] <madprops> codepal, yeah why?
[23:27:41] <madprops> i dont want to be making a request everytime i change data
[23:28:26] <codepal> http://static.palbakulich.me/files/testcanvas/html5-slideshow.html = working fine...
[23:28:49] <codepal> so it's definitely something to do with not loading it in your local dev webserver.
[23:29:32] <codepal> madprops, get your local development server working, then run it locally in that, it should then be testable.
[23:29:37] <madprops> codepal, i tried doing that in my server and i still cant manage to get it to work
[23:32:28] <codepal> madprops, well - how have you made sure that your local dev server is working properly?
[23:32:37] <codepal> madprops, what you running? apache2?
[23:33:23] <codepal> anyway - I just tested in apache2, works fine locally.
[23:38:58] <madprops> codepal, the server is fine, dunno what im doing wrong
[23:39:26] <codepal> madprops, which browsers have you tried it with?
[23:39:36] <codepal> the one that works for the demo, right?
[23:40:25] <madprops> codepal, not really, I integrated it into a django app im doing
[23:42:14] <sgrover> I wrote a plugin/tool and it isn't working in IE.  All other browsers seem to be just fine.  Could someone take a look and maybe see why it's not working in IE?  http://grover.open2space.com/sites/default/files/scratch/twpmap/index.htm
[23:42:50] <codepal> sgrover, make sure that you've removed ALL of your console.log calls... that caught me once!
[23:43:04] <iszak> OR
[23:43:09] <sgrover> I think I've done that, but will take a look.
[23:43:10] <iszak> you could just define console.log if it doesn't exist
[23:43:26] <codepal> iszak, good point.
[23:43:47] <codepal> but once you've got it working in other compliant browsers, it should _just work_ in IE.
[23:44:10] <codepal> so there's no need for console.log no more....
[23:44:31] <sgrover> codepal: I'm targeting IE8...
[23:45:05] <codepal> madprops, there might be something in that way of things, I suspect that you've got a jquery conflict.
[23:45:13] <sgrover> found a console.log in my sub-library.. I'll try again in IE
[23:45:22] <codepal> madprops, your already loading jquery in the base template?
[23:45:35] <systemfault> I would also check for keywords..
[23:45:52] <systemfault> Like "default" at line 33 of Twpmap.js
[23:46:27] <codepal> madprops, try overriding your django jquery with a more recent version - maybe 1.7. and make sure your only loading jquery once.
[23:49:36] <madprops> codepal, the example uses 1.4 im loading 1.5
[23:50:30] <sgrover> still no joy.  In IE 8 or 9.  There is no console.log in either of the two custom files.
[23:51:18] <codepal> sgrover, then you need to check more keywords that conflict in IE, as suggested by systemfault.
[23:51:34] <sgrover> ahh.. missed that... will do.
[23:51:37] <systemfault> codepal: Your IE8 debugger doesn't tell you anything?
[23:51:38] <codepal> madprops, loading it in your template?
[23:51:44] <systemfault> err
[23:51:49] <systemfault> Sorry, sgrover
[23:51:49] <sgrover> thanks.
[23:52:18] <codepal> systemfault, funny thing with my problem, the IE8 debugger made the page work!!
[23:52:25] <systemfault> Ah.
[23:52:25] <codepal> with console.log calls in it.
[23:52:28] <sgrover> systemfault: coding on a Linux Box, testing on a windows box for completeness.
[23:52:30] <madprops> codepal, yeah
[23:52:32] <systemfault> codepal: That's normal
[23:52:51] <systemfault> IE8 supports console.log... only when the debugger is on
[23:53:14] <codepal> madprops, hrrm - you have django-debug-toolbar installed by any chance?
[23:54:30] <madprops> codepal, nope
[23:55:13] <codepal> madprops, it's got to be something conflicting, what other jquery libs are you loading?
[23:55:30] <Phelms215>       success: function( data )
[23:55:32] <Phelms215>       success: function( data )
[23:55:38] <codepal> madprops, maybe head on over to #django, try to find out / make sure if something with django would prevent it running properly.
[23:56:08] <codepal> madprops, does the prev - next buttons work on your django site?
[23:56:11] <Phelms215> hey, I'm using some ajax and using success: function( data ) to get the return (from the PHP file ) in the var data.. but data ends up empty
[23:56:17] <madprops> codepal, im loading imgscale
[23:56:20] <codepal> madprops, for the demo?
[23:56:38] <madprops> codepal, but i dont need it, im gonna remove it
[23:57:26] <codepal> if next / prev isn't working, it's gotta be a badly loaded jquery - imo
[23:59:54] <Phelms215> any1 have any ideas why?
