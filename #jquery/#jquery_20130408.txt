[00:08:26] <singh_abhinav> Cork:  I do not need to reload page, I want user to go to next page when they click one of the link and POST parameters to that page instead of showing parameters in URL

[00:19:41] <Gatito`K> Hi! Is it possible to make do something for JQyery resizable when changes are made (event or something)?
[00:20:13] <Cork> changed?
[00:20:33] <Gatito`K> yes
[00:20:45] <Cork> are you talking about when the realizable is resized?
[00:20:50] <Gatito`K> yes :)
[00:21:09] <Gatito`K> how can i cach this?
[00:21:15] <Cork> should be

[01:13:25] <coldhead> ur funeral pal
[01:13:46] <Cork> funeral?
[01:14:39] <coldhead> i just get the feeling it's going to be one of those days
[01:14:53] <coldhead> prove me wrong, #jQuery, prove me wrong
[01:14:53] <eightfold> i want to select <a>'s that have an <img> inside them and run swipbox on them. original code: $(".postcontent a").swipebox();
[01:14:59] <eightfold> that is working
[01:15:12] <coldhead> $('a:has(img)')
[01:15:16] <coldhead> ?has @ eightfold
[01:15:16] <eightfold> shouldn't this do what i want: $('a').has('img').swipebox();
[01:15:16] <bot-t> eightfold, .has(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[01:15:17] <eightfold> ?
[01:16:47] <seutje> eightfold: .has returns a boolean
[01:16:50] <seutje> `api has
[01:16:51] <b-ot> seutje: .has(): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[01:17:03] <seutje> oh wait, it doesn't sry
[01:17:20] <eightfold> coldhead: $('a:has(img)') worked better than mine, thanks!
[01:17:48] <seutje> I need to get some coffee first :x
[01:17:55] <Cork> :has() should do the exact same thing as .has()
[01:19:00] <Cork> seutje: i think you thought of .is()
[01:19:08] <seutje> yeah
[01:19:18] <seutje> has sounds sorta similar when ur still asleep
[01:19:28] <Cork> ya
[01:19:42] <Cork> i've already found those two function naming confusing
[01:19:47] <seutje> like I mean, it sounds like it would return a boolean
[01:20:24] <seutje> guess that's contains
[01:21:24] <softmanpetro> $('#myselect').val() or $(this).val() inside $('#myselect').live('change',function(){... is null in IE but is ok in FF or chrome ! Any hint please ?
[01:21:44] <seutje> change events don't bubble properly iirc
[01:22:12] <Cork> that should be fixed in newer versions of jquery at least
[01:22:21] <Cork> through the custom event setup
[01:22:38] <seutje> but he's using old live
[01:22:46] <Cork> softmanpetro: btw, live is depricated
[01:22:52] <Cork> seutje: ya, was about to mention that :)
[01:22:58] <coldhead> deprecated*
[01:23:06] <Cork> and removed in 1.9+
[01:23:35] <softmanpetro> oh...
[01:24:42] <softmanpetro> and is replaced by ___ ? Cork ! I see nothing mentioned here http://api.jquery.com/live/
[01:24:50] <Cork> user delegate or on to achieve the same thing
[01:24:56] <Cork> ?.on
[01:24:59] <Cork> ?.delegate
[01:25:00] <bot-t> Cork, .on() | jQuery API Documentation - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:25:00] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[01:25:18] <Cork> softmanpetro: the syntax is different though
[01:25:29] <softmanpetro> and you think that's why I am not getting the select val ?
[01:25:40] <Cork> softmanpetro: no
[01:25:49] <softmanpetro> :)
[01:25:58] <Cork> if you get undefined from val, i would guess at that the selector fails
[01:26:06] <Cork> but the fact about live still stands
[01:26:23] <houser> I am looking for a form-validation plugin which shows validation errors in speech bubbles which are out of the normal document flow. Anybody have suggestions for such a lib?
[01:27:01] <Cork> softmanpetro: what do you get from $(event.target).val() ?
[01:30:23] <softmanpetro> I get undefined Cork
[01:30:40] <diverdude> anyone?
[01:31:56] <Cork> softmanpetro: and alert(this.nodeType) ?
[01:32:35] <Cork> softmanpetro: also what does $('[id="myselect"]').length give you?
[01:33:33] <softmanpetro> that's 1
[01:34:08] <Cork> and the one before?
[01:35:34] <softmanpetro> $('[id="myselect"]').length is 0
[01:35:46] <softmanpetro> and alert(this.nodeType) is 1
[01:35:49] <Cork> ah
[01:36:10] <Cork> you need tp replace myselect with the id of you're target
[01:36:58] <softmanpetro> I did that Cork
[01:37:16] <Cork> and ya alert(this.tagName) was what i meant for you to test (sorry)
[01:37:32] <Cork> so the id doesn't exist when the change happen
[01:37:40] <Cork> that's ... weird
[01:38:27] <softmanpetro> alert(this.tagName); is 0
[01:39:00] <Cork> wtf...
[01:39:06] <Cork> that should be a string...
[01:39:20] <softmanpetro> strange as you've said
[01:39:31] <Cork> what about alert(this.nodeName) ?
[01:39:51] <softmanpetro> in my live change funct ... the first line was $('.popupDialog').html( 'Loading...' ); so that's why IE did not seen the select
[01:40:10] <Cork> ah
[01:40:12] <softmanpetro> I moved that line after I am getting the select value
[01:40:18] <softmanpetro> and now works in IE
[01:40:37] <softmanpetro> I will check in firefox which seems it offered a sort of workaround for such a mistake ?!
[01:40:56] <softmanpetro> thank you cork for helping me ;)
[01:41:14] <softmanpetro> Cork*
[01:48:37] <daslicht> hello I am getting a div like this : <div id="foo"> <div id='bar'></div> ... </div> from my server
[01:48:51] <daslicht> now i only like to use the bar div
[01:48:56] <daslicht> and not the surrounding container
[01:49:17] <daslicht> how do i get all children of a html string?
[01:49:22] <Cork> is this through ajax?
[01:49:26] <Cork> or .load or?

[01:59:52] <NoWired> I don't like websites with sound
[02:00:43] <Cork> adibhanna: why would you use jquery for that?
[02:00:50] <Cork> just set auto on the element ou
[02:00:55] <Cork> *you want to start with
[02:01:16] <NoWired> adibhanna, see this: http://www.catswhocode.com/blog/10-awesome-html5-audio-players
[02:01:24] <diverdude> anyone, why is there a broken image here: http://jsfiddle.net/VG5t3/1/ ?
[02:01:55] <adibhanna> NoWired, i'll check that page now
[02:01:59] <adibhanna> thank you
[02:02:44] <NoWired> but putting sound in a website, is something that a lot of people don't like it
[02:02:50] <Cork> adibhanna: content:url(twitter-logo.gif); doesn't exist on jsfiddle
[02:03:46] <adibhanna> NoWired, you are right but that's what i've been asked to do in my project
[02:04:57] <NoWired> other way, is using flash, and you can use grooveshark, for getting the songs that you want (and don't use your web traffic to play this music)

[02:23:30] <amaroks> diverdude: because its broken
[02:32:07] <chilversc_> trying to execute multiple ajax queries and then perform an action when they all complete, looked at using promise with jQuery.when but not sure how to handle partial failures
[02:32:20] <chilversc_> eg, if 2 succeed and 1 fails, I just want the data for the 2 that succeeded
[02:33:01] <chilversc_> jQuery.when().always() would sort of have that logic, but doesn't include the data which isn't much good
[02:34:21] <chilversc_> does any of the deferred/promise API support partial success/failure?
[02:45:15] <chilversc_> so it seems, jQuery.when loses the successful results if any of the promises fail
[02:45:18] <chilversc_> see, http://jsfiddle.net/XAAyx/1/
[02:45:45] <chilversc_> if you change c.reject to c.resolve, then done & always will fire with values ['a', 'b', 'c']
[02:46:08] <chilversc_> but when c fails, you only get the value for c's rejection, the resolved values are just lost
[02:50:03] <chilversc_> looks like I'm not the only one to find jQuery.when's handling of partial success to be a bit off http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11162
[03:01:22] <j3lte> Do you want to execute them async or not?
[03:02:43] <chilversc_> yeah, I find the promise api simpler than say, having to write an asynchronous loop
[03:03:27] <chilversc_> thinking I just need a new object that allows for partial success/failure, but not sure if the promise spec technically allows that, as it seems I would then be calling both the done and fail handlers
[03:04:36] <chilversc_> also wondering if this needs a different api and that perhaps promises are not quite correct here, some sort of async map/filter/reduce thing perhaps
[03:05:49] <chilversc_> though it seems for my current needs I can just wrap the ajax promise in my own promise, so when the ajax request fails I just resolve my own promise as successful with a null value (since I don't care about failures at the moment)
[03:06:55] <j3lte> I would approach it differently, allowing for asynchronous behaviour
[03:07:37] <chilversc_> j3lte: that would be difficult though, since they are related, eg I'm fetching items from 3 locations, those then need to be sorted and displayed
[03:08:00] <chilversc_> j3lte: the results also include a min/max stamp, and I need the highest min, and the lowest max
[03:08:16] <chilversc_> hence the reduce step
[03:08:31] <j3lte> So you would have an array with results
[03:10:29] <chilversc_> right, so my current thought is create the ajax requests, wrap the ajax promises in a deferred so I can translate a fail to an empty result, then I can use jQuery.when, effectivly translating the partial failure in to a success
[03:13:48] <j3lte> I would suggest working with a recursive function
[03:13:58] <j3lte> got a sec? I write some pseudocode
[03:15:02] <chilversc_> I thought about it, but I really hate having to wrap my head around CPS all the time, I find the promise/task based way of representing it to be much neater
[03:15:42] <chilversc_> though looking at C# for inspiration, it seems the new async/await stuff in C# also has this problem, probably because it brings in to question what does a partial success/failure even mean, which seems to be application/context dependent
[03:15:56] <j3lte> does this make sense: http://jsfiddle.net/J3lte/GZHyW/ ?
[03:16:12] <j3lte> it's pseudo, but you get the idea perhaps?
[03:16:26] <j3lte> it's not async, allthough the ajax calls are
[03:17:05] <chilversc_> yeah, though firing off all the requests at once has the advantage that the browser can use multiple simultanious requests and pipelining if supported
[03:17:17] <j3lte> true
[03:17:40] <j3lte> than you would need to keep an variable open on how many connections you made
[03:18:28] <j3lte> and on any succes or error, you would substract 1. If it reaches 0, you would fire the processresults function
[03:20:39] <chilversc_> j3lte: yeah, which is sort of what I was hoping to get by using $.when :)
[03:21:13] <chilversc_> this problem isn't that disimilar to RavenDB's problem with sharding and partial results if a shard is down
[03:21:45] <j3lte> If it isn't working, you write something yourself
[03:21:53] <j3lte> That's how I do things
[03:22:17] <chilversc_> I'm wondering about an api similar to when but waits for all the results still, and has an explicit way to handle partial failures
[03:22:41] <chilversc_> just not sure exactly what it would look like
[03:28:02] <j3lte> quick and dirty: http://jsfiddle.net/J3lte/GZHyW/2/
[03:29:05] <j3lte> could be much more efficient, I know. I like quick and dirty solutions
[03:30:14] <chilversc_> yeah, my quick and dirty is similar, https://gist.github.com/chilversc/3763ff13547f48d32c23
[03:31:18] <chilversc_> so then you can do; var queries = _.map(urls, query); $.when(queries).done(function(results) { ... }); function query(url) { return translateFailToNullResult($.getJSON(url)); }
[03:31:53] <chilversc_> which works if you don't care about failures, have to think a bit more if I want to handle failures and indicate they happened, but still show the partial result
[03:34:58] <naquad> can i somehow listen to event when fragment of url changes? kind of http://www.example.com/asdasd becomes http://www.example.com/asdasd#/x
[03:34:59] <naquad> ?
[03:35:00] <chilversc_> though $.when().done() doesn't seem to be working the way I wish it did :(
[03:35:45] <chilversc_> naquad: there's an event for fragment change, though not all browsers support that event, 'hashchange' is the event name
[03:36:38] <chilversc_> naquad: there's also pushstate as a more modern api that lets you change the url itself without reloading the page
[03:37:16] <wer0ckz> hi guys. help please -  - apprise('How many modems offline?', {'input':true}, function(r) {  if(r) { $("#report #rlist").append('There are $input modem offline</li>'); }
[03:37:21] <wer0ckz> i cant display the $input
[03:37:59] <naquad> chilversc_, thanks! hashchange helped :)
[03:38:09] <j3lte> naquad: https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-hashchange (it's old)
[03:38:24] <naquad> j3lte, exactly what i've googled :)
[03:39:06] <j3lte> chilversc_ i get your drift. I haven't used $.when myself
[03:40:00] <j3lte> But the thing is, I like working with callbacks and recursive functions more than using $.when. Just a habit I picked up when working with NodeJS
[03:45:57] <diverdude> What do you guys think about this validation notifier graphic? http://jsfiddle.net/emumf/5/
[03:48:16] <sfdcNoob> looks pretty good
[03:54:21] <wer0ckz> hi guys. help please -  - apprise('How many modems offline?', {'input':true}, function(r) {  if(r) { $("#report #rlist").append('There are $input modem offline</li>'); } - i cannot display the $input
[03:54:52] <j3lte> diverdude: p.speech:after --> border 6px looks better imho
[03:55:26] <Cork> wer0ckz: what is $input, a php varialbe?
[03:55:29] <Cork> *variable
[03:55:54] <j3lte> wer0ckz I have too little info. Can you put an example on jsfiddle or something?
[03:56:37] <diverdude> j3lte: yeah...i was actually considering that
[03:56:46] <diverdude> j3lte: its a good idea
[03:56:55] <j3lte> make it 7px
[03:57:13] <diverdude> j3lte: i was also considering a small X to close to bubble
[03:57:16] <chilversc_> j3lte: yeah, never liked nodejs's recursive design there, effectly requires you to translate what should be simple code in to continuation passing style and/or a state machine :)
[03:57:53] <chilversc_> j3lte: I think nodejs should incorporate an async/await syntax similar to what C# has
[03:57:55] <diverdude> 7 is definitly best
[03:58:46] <j3lte> chilversc_ I disagree. Recursive patterns... I like it. Reminds me of the old days of functional programming
[03:59:13] <j3lte> And yes, it takes some time to learn, but I think it's great. It improved my JS coding style
[04:04:54] <wer0ckz> hi guys. help please -  - apprise('How many modems offline?', {'input':true}, function(r) {  if(r) { $("#report #rlist").append('There are modem offline</li>'); } - how to display the value of the user input?
[04:05:06] <Cork> uh...
[04:05:13] <wer0ckz>  apprise('How many modems offline?', {'input':true} <- how can i get the value of the user input?
[04:05:13] <Cork> wer0ckz: not until you answers the questions
[04:06:05] <Cork> wer0ckz: what framework are you using for the apprise function?
[04:06:16] <wer0ckz> jquery1.9.1
[04:06:22] <wer0ckz> and apprise
[04:06:25] <Cork> jquery doens't have apprise
[04:06:45] <wer0ckz> apprise-1.5.full.js
[04:06:57] <chilversc_> j3lte: the trouble is, the nested functions and indentation start to get a bit silly
[04:07:24] <wer0ckz> sorry im still really new to jquery
[04:07:27] <wer0ckz> im using this http://thrivingkings.com/read/Apprise-The-attractive-alert-alternative-for-jQuery
[04:07:42] <Cork> wer0ckz: your question has quite little to do with jquery
[04:08:37] <Cork> wer0ckz: as far as i can tell apprise doesn't give the object into the callback function
[04:08:48] <miCSu> wer0ckz: ain't it in the r parameter of function?
[04:08:49] <Cork> wer0ckz: so you would have to store it in a variable and scope it
[04:09:01] <Cork> miCSu: its the answer, not the question
[04:09:31] <miCSu> um, I thought he asked for user input
[04:10:00] <Cork> hmm, ah, he pointed at the input object
[04:10:06] <Cork> then yes it would be the r
[04:10:35] <Cork> (though the documentation is a bit lacking)
[04:10:46] <wer0ckz> hi. i'll try again. sorry i'm still really new to jquery
[04:10:52] <wer0ckz> http://pastebin.com/CPa79L6P <-- see comment
[04:11:04] <wer0ckz> the code works but its not appending the total number of modems
[04:12:13] <Cork> wer0ckz: $("#report #rlist").append('There are ' + r + ' value modem offline</li>');
[04:12:14] <miCSu> wer0ckz: r has the value user inputted
[04:12:28] <wer0ckz> i see
[04:12:31] <wer0ckz> thank you so much
[04:12:36] <wer0ckz> :)
[04:13:46] <wer0ckz> so that value is r. got it
[04:15:30] <DarkKnightCZ> hi, i'm iterating elements through .each() function and in that function, i user .get() function for ajax requests... how do i access iterating element from inside .done() function in .get()?
[04:16:04] <DarkKnightCZ> (this is the code - http://pastebin.com/rN1LgWWu)
[04:19:20] <amaroks> DarkKnightCZ: which element?
[04:19:35] <DarkKnightCZ> the one in .each
[04:21:03] <amaroks> DarkKnightCZ: your script looks good
[04:22:14] <DarkKnightCZ> amaroks: $(this) inside that function is undefined, it throws cannot call createdocumentfragment
[04:22:39] <fengjie> Q: Since I'm doing some reverse engineering work,
[04:22:45] <DarkKnightCZ> i guess $(this) represents that function from .get request
[04:24:48] <fengjie> Since I'm doing some reverse engineering work on javascript, I wanna ask that if there's any way to replace javascript file and reload after that it has already loaded?
[04:25:06] <naquad> i need some plugin to track hashchange. is jQuery BBQ good enough?
[04:25:33] <Chosi> hey everyone. i was looking for a jquery filterbox plugin and stubled upon this one: https://github.com/stefanocudini/jquery-filterbox unfortunately the regex doesn't seem to match parts of strings very good and it's not updating on deletion of characters. does anyone know an alternative?
[04:29:36] <gnarf> DarkKnightCZ: the first parameter to each is an index in the collection, the second is an element
[04:29:36] <gnarf> so
[04:29:36] <gnarf> $.each(function(index, elem) { // use elem instead of this
[04:29:36] <gnarf> DarkKnightCZ: in a more generic solution, you could just var elem = $(this); as the first line of your function and then not have to wrap it up in $() everytime either
[04:30:00] <DarkKnightCZ> gnarf: yes, thanks, assigning $(this) to new variable works :)
[04:30:00] <gnarf> DarkKnightCZ: https://gist.github.com/gnarf37/ec50b6ff3be332296311
[04:30:12] <gnarf> DarkKnightCZ: you should do that anyway
[04:30:21] <DarkKnightCZ> yep, thanks very much :)
[04:30:26] <gnarf> avoid wrapping things up with $() multiple times, cache your selections
[04:31:21] <DarkKnightCZ> ok, thanks again :)
[04:33:22] <gnarf> fengjie: not really, you can overwrite whatever it creates, but you can't really "undo" what has been done
[04:41:56] <soee> .live is dropped in 1.9.1 ?
[04:42:19] <soee> yes it is.
[04:44:33] <tankblergh> Hi! I'm using visual studio/IE to debug a javascript site I have, but after we started using require.js, my VS no longer hits breakpoints. "The breakpoint will not currenlty be hit..etc". Debugging works until the moment we load pages with require.js. Anyone experienced something similar?
[04:48:36] <daslicht> how do i set a checkbox checked ?
[04:48:57] <daslicht> i trued attr("checked","true") but this has no effect ?
[04:51:25] <air_> daslicht: try .attr("checked", "checked");
[04:51:38] <daslicht> and if not checked ?
[04:51:54] <daslicht> remove the checked attr?
[04:52:53] <fris> .attr("checked", true);
[04:52:56] <fris> without quotes for true
[04:53:16] <daslicht> .attr("checked", true); diod not work
[04:53:18] <daslicht> i tried it
[04:53:31] <fris> can you pastebin your full code?
[04:53:37] <air_> there's some information about it here as well. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[04:53:38] <daslicht> i create a fiddle
[04:53:52] <daslicht> thank you
[04:54:36] <Cork> fris, daslicht: attr is for accessing and modifying attributes, and if you want to change a state for a checkbox its a property
[04:54:51] <daslicht> ahh
[04:55:02] <Cork> attr won't work cross browser, as not all browsers monitor attribute changes for these elements
[04:55:21] <fris> im thinking old versions then, forgot about using .prop
[04:55:37] <Cork> ya, attr was both attr and prop before
[04:55:56] <daslicht>  $('#toggle_event_enddate').prop("checked", true);
[04:55:59] <daslicht> works like a charm
[04:57:46] <daslicht> Note: Attempting to change the type property (or attribute) of an input element created via HTML or already in an HTML document will result in an error being thrown by Internet Explorer 6, 7, or 8.
[04:59:38] <daslicht> does that mean that wont work in IE ?
[04:59:38] <daslicht> whats the save way ?
[04:59:44] <Cork> fris, daslicht: just so happend to write an example that shows the difference between attr and prop http://jsfiddle.net/HgbjS/4/
[05:00:05] <Cork> daslicht: yes
[05:00:19] <Cork> ex. you can't convert a password field to a text field
[05:00:44] <daslicht> Cork: is therer a workaround?
[05:00:50] <Cork> replace the element
[05:00:56] <daslicht> :/
[05:00:57] <daslicht> lame
[05:00:59] <daslicht> ok
[05:04:54] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/DJzct/1/
[05:04:56] <daslicht> like this ?
[05:05:07] <daslicht> is this save ? and will even work in the IE ?
[05:07:03] <daslicht> Cork please have a look :)
[05:23:15] <Gatito`K> How can i set width of div in percentage using jquery? because i need to get width from JQuery later, but not in pixels, but in percentage
[05:24:06] <Gatito`K> css_width = $(element).css("width"); gives me my monitor width in pixels, but i need there 100% - is it possible?
[05:24:36] <Gatito`K> or maybe is it possible to set width to unknown? :D
[05:34:50] <shoky> daslicht: don't do that.. just do .prop("checked", true)   that doesn't have anything to do with the "type" property
[05:35:13] <daslicht> so prop will work in ie ?
[05:35:39] <shoky> yes. re-read that note. it's only regarding "type" property, not "checked" property
[05:39:12] <daslicht> ok
[05:39:14] <daslicht> tahnks
[05:53:53] <fuzai> http://jsfiddle.net/Vt36h/ <---- can someone please explain to me why change isn't being triggered?
[05:54:15] <dAnjou> hey, in this demo (http://jqueryui.com/spinner/) i can scroll in the spinner and it changes the value, but when i create a spinner in my own page i can't. am i missing something?
[05:54:36] <dAnjou> i basically use the same code like in the demo
[05:54:42] <fuzai> are you loading the proper javascript links?
[05:54:53] <fuzai> where is a link to your page?
[05:55:39] <dAnjou> fuzai: it's local. and yes, all files are loaded properly, i use the CDN.
[05:56:34] <fuzai> i guess try reproducing the demo in jsfiddle
[05:57:05] <fuzai> have you checked the output of your web console for hints?
[05:57:42] <dAnjou> everything's fine there, no warnings, no errors
[06:01:31] <dAnjou> fuzai: this is what i have (basically) http://jsfiddle.net/uV9Jp/
[06:01:38] <dAnjou> and it doesn't even work there
[06:01:47] <fuzai> one second let me finish with my fiddle and i'll look at it
[06:02:27] <dAnjou> k, thanks
[06:07:06] <dAnjou> same behaviour in chromium and firefox btw.
[06:14:18] <fuzai> that works for me
[06:14:51] <fuzai> dAnjou: that works for me
[06:14:55] <dAnjou> hmm
[06:15:15] <fuzai> i just clicked on the link
[06:15:29] <fuzai> maybe you have javascript disabled or something?
[06:15:32] <reuf> how many ajax requests can be fired off and handled simulataneously and does it depend on browser - if yes, how many per browser type?
[06:15:58] <dAnjou> fuzai: then the whole thing wouldn't get created
[06:16:12] <dAnjou> i can see it but the scrolling doesn't work
[06:16:26] <dAnjou> fuzai: can you scroll in it and change the value?
[06:16:32] <fuzai> yep
[06:16:35] <fuzai> i just updated it
[06:16:39] <fuzai> so it was more jsfiddle friendly
[06:16:45] <fuzai> http://jsfiddle.net/uV9Jp/1/
[06:17:09] <sfdcNoob> dAnjou: ADD http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/external/jquery.mousewheel.js to external resource
[06:17:27] <fuzai> oh i didn't scroll
[06:17:30] <fuzai> i clicked on the arrows
[06:17:56] <dAnjou> sfdcNoob: aahh, that might solve it
[06:18:19] <dAnjou> sfdcNoob: yep, thank you very much
[06:19:16] <sfdcNoob> dAnjou: I just 'inspect Element' everything lol yw :) saw that file on the example link u posted :)
[06:20:13] <fuzai> http://jsfiddle.net/Vt36h/1/ can you explain to me why my if *.length < 8 isn't working in this even though alert is telling me the value is updating correctly?
[06:21:01] <dAnjou> sfdcNoob: thanks for doing that. i admit i was too lazy.
[06:22:20] <fuzai> nm i figured out what is going on
[06:23:16] <dAnjou> i'd suggest you use console.log() for debugging instead of alert
[06:24:28] <amaroks> dAnjou:
[06:29:08] <dAnjou> amaroks: yes?
[06:30:57] <lejocelyn> Hey, do you know why this little snipet doesn't work ? http://pastebin.fr/26964 it's just for disabling tabs with jquery ui
[06:31:07] <lejocelyn> I don't understand what's wrong with it
[06:31:19] <lejocelyn> actually, it disable only number 3 tab
[06:31:41] <lejocelyn> so I don't think it comes from the getCookie function
[06:37:43] <shoky> lejocelyn: it should disable the 3rd and 4th tabs
[06:48:00] <draginx> Is there a way to combine jquery ui droppable and sortable? I remember reading it on the docs somewhere but I cannot find it fo rthe life of me anywhere :/
[06:49:21] <shoky> combine how? you can combine draggables with sortables
[06:49:26] <draginx> Nevermind found it I believe :)
[06:49:33] <draginx> shoky: connectToSortable: <-- with that yes? :)
[06:49:47] <draginx> wait no thats draggable grr
[06:49:47] <shoky> yea
[06:50:14] <draginx> yeah I need sortables to be able to be dropped into a zone
[06:50:43] <draginx> i guess i can to sortable <-> draggable <-> droppable connection
[06:51:09] <shoky> well, if it works for you, you can connect sortables
[06:52:04] <draginx> like that though? or is there a better way?
[06:52:19] <shoky> http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#connect-lists
[06:52:24] <shoky> http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#empty-lists
[06:52:40] <lejocelyn> shoky: ah, maybe that's the problem
[06:52:57] <shoky> lejocelyn: if you only have 3 tabs, yes ;]
[06:54:00] <draginx> shoky: i dont think this is what im looking for
[06:54:02] <draginx> but i could be wrong
[06:55:06] <draginx> Also does jquery 1.9 support mozilla firefox 4 still? Like it's just IE 6/7/8 support thats been dropped?
[06:55:10] <draginx> And safari 4?
[06:57:32] <shoky> 1.9 still supports IE6/7/8
[06:58:19] <draginx> ah I see, it's 2.0
[06:58:25] <shoky> http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[07:00:18] <pablo_tola> I need help with a draggable - sortable issue, anybody that could help?
[07:00:33] <shoky> pablo_tola: ask
[07:00:40] <draginx> pablo_tola: im currently in that code, but in all honesty you should ask your question and not ask to ask :)
[07:02:17] <pablo_tola> I'm trying to drag an object into a frame, both the source and the destination containers are position absolute, there is an offset on the target, is there a way to correct that offset?
[07:05:44] <Colmea> Hello. I have an issue with jquery UI buttons. I would like to dynamically set attr to my jqueryUI button, like this: http://pastebin.com/8xTpPvbA  but it doesn't work
[07:06:32] <Colmea> Do you know how can I get html attr in my jquery button ?
[07:06:43] <shoky> pablo_tola: what do you mean by "a frame"?  also, make a jsfiddle showing the issue
[07:06:57] <pablo_tola> I mean an iframe, sorry.
[07:07:02] <shoky> oh
[07:07:28] <shoky> that complicates things quite a bit, i'd imagine
[07:07:37] <pablo_tola> I don't have experience with jsfiddle, will try to put something together.
[07:12:02] <rebrain> Colmea: set and get are different things
[07:12:08] <rebrain> what do you need?
[07:13:22] <Colmea> rebrain: I nedd to dynamically set params, depends on my attr in my html
[07:14:14] <Colmea> rebrain: for example in my pastebin, I set text-icon="false", and I would like that my js button set texte: false
[07:15:57] <Colmea> Like jQuery Mobile actually. You can set js params from html attr
[07:16:23] <shoky> Colmea:  $(this) would only work inside a nested function, not in an object literal
[07:16:59] <Colmea> shoky: Ok that what I tought
[07:17:58] <shoky> if its only one button, this works.. http://pastebin.com/s8LmnqTn
[07:18:36] <shoky> if it's more, you can use .each(function(){..})  and you can use $(this) inside
[07:18:48] <Colmea> shoky: No it's not :/ It's for many buttons
[07:18:55] <rebrain> Colmea: http://jsfiddle.net/barRX/ check this
[07:20:04] <Colmea> rebrain: I don't get it Oo why 'icon-text', and iconText in html ? How could it work
[07:20:50] <rebrain> Colmea: nevermind i messed up
[07:20:58] <Colmea> rebrain: ok :D
[07:21:15] <shoky> Colmea: http://jsfiddle.net/barRX/1/
[07:23:28] <Colmea> shoky: Thanks ! In term of performance, it's not too heavy to set 20-25 in a js file called on each page ?
[07:24:14] <Colmea> shoky: 20-25 functions like this (for each button)
[07:26:00] <shoky> i dunno, depends what yer doin exactly
[07:26:20] * xec_ sits on shoky
[07:26:31] * shoky carpets
[07:26:59] <Colmea> shoky: Only what you do in your function, but for each buttons (ui-icon-pencil, ui-icon-search, ...)
[07:27:31] <xec_> shoky: i didn't know carpet could be a verb
[07:27:53] <shoky> Colmea: why not give all the buttons a shared class and just use that as the selector
[07:27:54] <xec_> shoky: did you know "fist" can be a verb?
[07:28:07] * xec_ retracts previous statement
[07:28:12] <shoky> Hmm
[07:28:26] <Colmea> shoky: Yes that's what I'm thinking about
[07:28:33] <xec_> it sounded fun in my head, then came out all nasty
[07:28:37] <shoky> i'll use it as an exclamation
[07:29:22] <Deno258> Hi can anyone help me to find some jQuery ? I want to on mouse over show div and on mouse over hide it
[07:29:38] <Deno258> With scrolling animation :)
[07:29:44] <xec_> Deno258: you want to both hide and show on mouse over?
[07:29:53] <shoky> FIST!!
[07:29:58] * xec_ hides
[07:30:16] <Deno258> xec_: On mouse onver show, on mouse out hide
[07:30:18] <Deno258> I'm sorry
[07:31:01] <xec_> Deno258: well, you have the "mouseenter" and "mouseleave" events, and the .slideUp() and .slideDown() methods - what have you tried so far?
[07:31:41] <Deno258> xec_: Nothing I never used jQuery :D
[07:31:55] <xec_> Deno258: i see. have you used javascript?
[07:32:48] <Deno258> xec_: Just what I found on internet
[07:33:12] <rebrain> lol
[07:33:18] <Assimilater> Hi all, I'm trying to make an ajax file upload process accessed by clicking an <a> ui button. http://jsfiddle.net/hpvHF/3/ shows the concept works works but http://dot.aquaveo.com/index.php?q=sMap.php doesn't appear to. Click an icon on the map and try clicking the UpdatePicture button. Notice the console logs the correct input[type="file"] but the click method doesn't open the dialog. Working on line 101 of sMap.js. Any ideas why?
[07:34:00] <xec_> Deno258: i see. well. jquery is a javascript library, so you first need to know javascript. i suggest you start out with some basic tutorials. codecademy.com looks promising
[07:34:04] <killer`toaster> Hello. I have a map that has dynamic points (made in divs) on it. Each point has 1 or more labels (also divs) of the restaurants located at that point. I'd like to draw a connector lines that go from each pointer, to each of their respective labels. Could somebody point me in the right direction to accomplish this?
[07:34:25] <Deno258> xec_: Ok, thank you so much ;)
[07:34:28] <Jester86> Hey guys .. have any of you ran into issueing using jquery forms in IE?
[07:35:04] <Jester86> We have a form that is now always assuming failure case even though it used to work fine
[07:35:38] <Jester86> I should note that it works fine outside of IE.. in IE 9 it now crashes.  I believe we received IE updates since the last time it worked properly in IE
[07:36:09] <Jester86> the server returns 200 so we know that the server is posting fine but IE is still assuming a failure for some reason
[07:50:02] <mboro> hi! is there any standalone jQuery AJAX functionality available? my SDK only uses the $.ajax part of jQuery and I'd like to avoid having users fetch the entire library for that functionality
[07:53:21] <patstoms> is there online any jquery skill test quiz or something like that?
[07:55:21] <xec_> mboro: i'm not sure, but you might be able to extract what you need from https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/src/ajax
[07:57:11] <defaultro> hey folks, which website do you like when you are applying for a job?
[07:57:28] <Jester86> defaultro - hate your job?
[07:58:08] <Jester86> defaultro, where are you located - my company is always looking to hire it seems.
[07:58:12] <mboro> xec_: will take a lot at it - thx
[07:59:21] <pablo_tola> shoky: here's a sample of what I need: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6312959/iframe/index.html
[07:59:46] <defaultro> Jester86, I lost my job last week
[08:00:29] <pablo_tola> shoky: if you try to drop it inside the box, no luck, try to drop it 100px above the box.
[08:00:42] <Jester86> defaultro, where are you located?
[08:01:02] <sfdcNoob> patstoms: http://try.jquery.com/ :)
[08:01:57] <defaultro> Jester86, Chicago
[08:02:17] <Jester86> defaultro, are you willing to relocate?
[08:02:18] <patstoms> sfdcNoob, I don¥t mean to learn. I mean to test knowladge.
[08:02:40] <defaultro> very tough right now
[08:02:57] <defaultro> if I was single, yes
[08:03:25] <yordan> guys, is there a proper way i can check if a slider (the jquery-ui widget slider) is initialized or not?
[08:03:34] <sfdcNoob> .g jquery skill test quiz
[08:03:35] <b-ot> sfdcNoob: jQuery Quiz ‚Üí http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_quiz.asp
[08:04:27] <shoky> pablo_tola: sorry no idea how to deal with iframes there
[08:04:41] <pablo_tola> ok thanks for your help
[08:04:53] <shoky> why does it have to be an iframe?
[08:06:51] <pablo_tola> shoky: I'm developing a CMS application for the company I work for, the iframe contains a preview of the page and you can drag content modules into it, I tried first with a div but got a lot of problems with duplicate css stylse and scripts affecting the page preview.
[08:09:26] <yordan> hello? someone? :}
[08:10:01] <shoky> a preview you can drag stuff into? funky
[08:11:31] <shoky> yordan: you can check if it has "ui-slider" class
[08:13:14] <yordan> thanks! :) that's a great idea
[08:13:40] <yordan> i was going to check the data attribute like this: if ($obj.data('slider widget fullName')) {...}
[08:13:46] <yordan> but i guess checking for class is better
[08:23:58] <tubbo> hey guys, what's that plugin that gives you deprecation warnings for the 1.8 API in 1.9, but still allows you to use the 1.8 API
[08:29:02] <tubbo> wow, dead in here today huh? that's surprising
[08:29:27] <BillCriswell> tubbo: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/
[08:30:58] <tubbo> oh lol :D
[08:31:08] <tubbo> BillCriswell: of course it's on the d/l page what was i thinking ;)
[08:31:23] <BillCriswell> It's an illusive beast.
[08:32:29] <BillCriswell> Hmm.. illusive and elusive are interesting words
[08:33:13] <finishingmove> what's this about? Cannot read property 'show' of undefined
[08:33:14] <finishingmove>     at checkPieEnabled (flot plugin, using pie charts)
[08:34:06] <DarkArtist69> am looking to display a plot on a pre defined chart. i have been looking on line but can not fined exactly what i am looking for .Maybe using the wrong key words. Any ideas?
[08:34:36] <DarkArtist69> where the user inputs 2 numbers to be cross referenced then plotted.
[08:38:12] <tubbo> BillCriswell: an interesting caveat to that plugin is it doesn't seem to tell me *where* my live()'s are
[08:38:25] <tubbo> it just says "you have live()s"
[08:38:34] <BillCriswell> Hm.
[08:38:46] <tubbo> but i know that. i really just need to know if i'm breaking my code when i move live's into document-on events.
[08:39:01] <tubbo> ostensibly it's just syntax changes and i shouldn't affect the way the code is actually running, right?
[08:40:28] <BillCriswell> Yeah that sounds about right.
[08:40:37] <BillCriswell> I never actually used it. My job is way too god damn boring to do anything actually interesting with jQuery.
[08:45:45] <spobat> what does this error really mean? http://ideone.com/7iuQRC
[08:50:43] <tw2113> which part
[08:52:07] <spobat> oh, nvm :S
[08:52:21] <spobat> the problem was that the script tag wasn't within body
[08:54:09] <Assimilater_Buil> I'm trying to make an ajax file upload process accessed by clicking an <a> ui button. http://jsfiddle.net/hpvHF/3/ shows the concept works works but http://dot.aquaveo.com/index.php?q=sMap.php doesn't appear to. Click an icon on the map and try clicking the UpdatePicture button. Notice the console logs the correct input[type="file"] but the click method doesn't open the dialog. Working on line 101 of sMap.js. Any ideas why?
[09:00:59] <gnarf> Assimilater_Buil: i don't believe you're allowed to open that dialog with .click in some browsers
[09:01:23] <gnarf> or at least in some code paths
[09:01:53] <gnarf> like you might HAVE to do it in response to a .click event too
[09:02:43] <Assimilater_Buil> gnarf: i tested that fiddle in firefox, chrome, ie10, and opera and it works...i don't understand your last comment
[09:03:25] <gnarf> Assimilater_Buil: i think it's only allowed to open that input[type=file] like that if you are processing a MouseEvent --- change isn't a MouseEvent
[09:03:32] <gnarf> might even be "click" only
[09:04:04] <gnarf> there is some security restriction in place for that action that prevents it from working in non "user input" events
[09:04:22] <Assimilater_Buil> gnarf: I do have a click event handler...
[09:04:36] <gnarf> Assimilater_Buil: but you are trying to open it from a "change" event handler
[09:04:44] <gnarf> i'm saying i think it only works in "click" handlers
[09:05:32] <Assimilater_Buil> oh wait, my dev site has a little different code, the click event is on line 97
[09:05:44] <gnarf> or not... http://jsfiddle.net/hpvHF/5/
[09:05:44] <Assimilater_Buil> the change is for when the user selects a file from the dialot
[09:05:46] <Assimilater_Buil> dialog
[09:05:54] * gnarf shrugs
[09:06:02] <gnarf> out of ideas Assimilater_Buil
[09:06:11] <gnarf> does a console.log on the line before the .click() run?
[09:07:18] <Assimilater_Buil> yes (refresh page)
[09:07:28] <kickandrew> Assimilater_Buil: just use .trigger('click') instead of .click() not sure why but that makes it work for me.
[09:07:29] <Assimilater_Buil> and you can see it logs the objecs in the click event
[09:08:03] <Assimilater_Buil> kickandrew: you're a genius! how strange indeed....
[09:08:39] <kickandrew> might be a jquery bug, since .click() (with no args) is supposed to be an alias for .trigger('click')
[09:09:03] <dcherman> kickandrew: it's not a jquery bug.  something on the page redefined $.fn.click.  the source doesn't look right at all.
[09:09:20] <Assimilater_Buil> it may also be google maps causing issues
[09:09:27] <kickandrew> dcherman: fair enough, I didn't have enough time to dive in to the code
[09:09:54] <gnarf> um
[09:09:55] <gnarf> wtf
[09:10:02] <gnarf> yeah $.fn.click is totally wrong
[09:10:08] <gnarf> it's not using jQuery
[09:10:21] <gnarf> how does that not break entirely?
[09:12:04] <Assimilater_Buil> it only appears to affect the click events inside the gmap
[09:12:25] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/1z2W0L3h0I39
[09:12:31] <gnarf> Assimilater_Buil: ^^^ that is totally broken
[09:12:46] <gnarf> where is that code coming from?
[09:13:10] <Assimilater_Buil> my only guess is the jquery plugin for google maps
[09:13:27] <Assimilater_Buil> jQuery/gmaps/min/jquery.ui.map.full.min.js on the site
[09:14:00] <gnarf> Assimilater_Buil: who writes this plugin so that I might go yell at them for doing something so breaking
[09:14:11] <gnarf> that is >terrible<
[09:14:50] <Assimilater_Buil> http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-map/ > https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/jquery-ui-map-discuss > Johan S√§ll Larsson
[09:14:53] <dcherman> yep, it's the gmaps plugin
[09:19:16] <gnarf> that is absolutely terrible
[09:19:24] * gnarf shakes head 
[09:19:43] <gnarf> Assimilater_Buil: use .trigger('click') and .on('click', function(){}) i guess instead of your aliases
[09:19:56] <gnarf> or get rid of that chunk of code that clobbers the jQuery event handling routines
[09:20:10] <draginx> if I have sortables.sortable("refresh").sortable("refreshPositions"); and sortables is a jquery.sortable object.. when I add to the DOM why is not technically refreshing and allowing me to put in new items?
[09:20:43] <dcherman> i'd just get rid of it.  breaks every other plugin's assumptions that .click actually does what it says it does.
[09:20:56] <gnarf> that code is totally broken, +1 dcherman
[09:20:57] <dcherman> and you know....all of those other events too.
[09:21:05] <gnarf> it doesn't even iterate the set when it binds
[09:21:24] <gnarf> nor does it deal with the attach/trigger scenario
[09:21:39] <Assimilater_Buil> perhaps it would be best for me to just learn to use the regular api (not jquery plugin)
[09:22:10] <gnarf> Assimilater_Buil: +1 ;)
[09:27:31] <Otineb> Does anyone know why jquery would work in FF/Chrome/Opera but not IE (aside from IE blows giant chunks)
[09:28:00] <Otineb> some online are suggesting using this <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=8"></meta>
[09:28:21] <Otineb> wondering if any of you have any experience "fixing" code for IE 9
[09:28:27] <air_> Otineb: from that description, no, nobody knows. you better explain more in detail what's your problem.
[09:28:34] <Otineb> lol
[09:28:40] <Otineb> ok
[09:28:43] <air_> :)
[09:28:49] <Otineb> @air_ this is my script http://jsfiddle.net/z63Zm/
[09:29:03] <Otineb> works great everywhere except IE9.0 in Windows
[09:29:24] <air_> and what happens there?
[09:29:29] <air_> it doesn't trigger on keyup?
[09:29:58] <Otineb> ok so it should detect what country code your phone number is (in this case 1, or 33, or 52) and auto mask the field for the proper formatting
[09:30:05] <Otineb> in IE it doesn't mask or recognize
[09:30:30] <air_> does the keyup function ever get called in ie?
[09:31:07] <Otineb> @air_ I would hope so, it's in the script. is there something else I need to do to call it in IE?
[09:32:48] <Deno258> Does anybody have time to help me ? :D
[09:32:52] <Otineb> air_: someone on stackoverflow said "The problem is that IE9 is now adhering to standards and this gives problems with plugins trying to circumvent the pre IE9 problems." and suggested using a meta tag to force IE 9  to pretend it's IE 8. That feels messy to me but might be the best choice.
[09:33:25] <air_> Otineb: I really haven't tested almost anything in IE9, so I can't really comment on that. But I agree, it sounds like a bad solution.
[09:33:54] <air_> Otineb: try to identify the exact issue first. that maskedinput script isn't too large, so it should be doable.
[09:34:08] <Otineb> air_: I hate working on corporate accounts. Why can't IT departments just force better browsers on everyone
[09:34:41] <air_> Otineb: well, as long as you bill them properly, it's ok ;)
[09:34:52] <Otineb> air_: yeh. I will. Just hoping someone would say, "oh yea, just do x and IE will work like chrome/FF."
[09:35:10] <Otineb> air_: for sure. thanks
[09:38:05] <Z3R0> lol Otineb
[09:38:18] <Otineb> adding "<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=8"></meta> " worked in my production environment
[09:38:28] <Otineb> weaksauce\
[09:39:14] <Z3R0> problem is, alot of other corporate inteties such as Banks, don't support the latest and greatest
[09:39:19] <Z3R0> just had an issue with that
[09:39:23] <friedbyte> Hi, I'm trying to display hidden HTML at the bottom when someone hovers on a list item higher up in the source. I don't think I can use .append() though because of an z-index issue with another element on the page. Is there a way I can get the location of the list item that is hovered on and use those coordinates to position the hidden HTML at the bottom of the page?
[09:39:47] <Otineb> Z3R0: so abnoxious
[09:39:53] <Otineb> obnoxious*
[09:39:58] <Otineb> yikes(sp?)
[09:40:09] <Z3R0> my user upgraded to IE10 and it broke the site lol
[09:40:13] <Otineb> hahaha
[09:40:19] <Z3R0> so they told us to either revert to IE9 or use FireFox
[09:40:29] <Otineb> fun
[09:40:48] <Z3R0> yea, I was pretty pissed lol
[09:40:53] <Deno258> :D
[09:41:01] <Z3R0> Why can't there just be a single browser... why? why/
[09:41:03] <NoiseEee> IE=EDGE
[09:41:16] <Deno258> Z3R0 +1
[09:41:32] <Assimilater_Buil> if only there were more developers with enough guts to not bother supporting ie and include messages on their site about using a modern browser like firefox or chrome
[09:41:35] <Z3R0> you got standards everywhere that don't conform to anything... so you have to write 3-4x the code for a single element so it's cross browser compatible... seriously ?
[09:42:55] <Otineb> Z3R0: exactly
[09:42:59] <Otineb> it's a nightmare
[09:43:02] <anew> assimilater_buil it has nothing to with guts.. it has to do with users who use IE
[09:43:07] <anew> devs have nothing to do with it
[09:43:20] <Z3R0> I honestly prefer chrome over all, but the majority of users for businesses use IE...
[09:43:36] <Assimilater_Buil> anew: and why don't devs tell users to get smart?
[09:43:42] <Otineb> according to this stackoverflow thread, IE9 is "now adhering to standards" and the problem lies with plugins that use workarounds
[09:43:52] <anew> u thnk a top 5000 site in the world is going to put 'we dont support ie!' .. they would lose so much business
[09:43:57] <Z3R0> yea but apparently there were changes between IE9 and IE10
[09:44:07] <anew> ie needs to get with the program
[09:44:15] <anew> but i think evreyone else's hands are tied
[09:44:40] <anew> also assimilater_buil your average idiot internet user is not smart, they wont even know wtf chrome is
[09:44:51] <anew> 40+ age group more or less are retarded
[09:44:53] <Assimilater_Buil> if enough people saw "DON'T USE IE. IT DOESN'T WORK" from enough sites they'd migrate?
[09:45:06] <anew> ur overestimating 40+ idiots
[09:45:38] <Assimilater_Buil> lol, maybe, but my dad's 40+ and understands why IE sucks when it's explained to him
[09:45:55] <Otineb> how many times have you tried explaining what a browser is to a derp? More than i can count.
[09:46:36] <Assimilater_Buil> When I do a side by side comparison of border-radius and other css stuff between ie, firefox and chrome it seemed to do the job pretty well for the people at my old job
[09:46:50] <Assimilater_Buil> enough to get them to stop using ie
[09:47:41] <anew> yeah what otineb said.  mostly everyone is a derp.  ur dad has u as a son so u can explain things to him
[09:47:48] <anew> most peole dont have that luxury and are just derps
[09:47:58] <Deno258> How can I move object ? :D
[09:48:03] <Assimilater_Buil> hehe
[09:48:06] <Deno258> I mean .. div
[09:48:08] <anew> lol
[09:48:24] <Otineb> lol
[09:49:00] <Stephen-B> Hi all, I'm having a problem with the jQuery validation plugin.  I have created a JSFiddle and it works fine, but when I include it in my page it refuses to find any of the validation methods in the additional-methods file, can someone here please assist me in debugging this
[09:51:54] <Snwspeckle> I am trying to pass the ID of my table from PHP to a javascript variable and its not passing
[09:52:23] <Snwspeckle> http://jsfiddle.net/eVnjS/
[09:54:32] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: For a start your JSFiddle doesn't have any of the jquery files included
[09:55:20] <Snwspeckle> Stephen-B: I've never really use JSFiddle, bare with me here
[09:55:46] <Snwspeckle> I updated my code
[09:55:49] <Snwspeckle> http://jsfiddle.net/eVnjS/3/
[09:55:53] <Stephen-B> OK, well you have to treat it like you normally would, so if you would normally include a file on your page you need to include it fiddle
[09:56:00] <Snwspeckle> I am trying to pass a dummy variable, "test" but its undefined
[09:56:15] <Snwspeckle> I also included JQuery like you said
[09:56:59] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: var userID = $(this).attr('data-userID');
[09:57:17] <NoiseEee> Snwspeckle: you should never, ever be using document.write
[09:57:28] <Snwspeckle> I am using it for testing purposes
[09:57:36] <NoiseEee> all the more reason not to.
[09:57:41] <NoiseEee> it overrwrites the document.
[09:58:02] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: http://jsfiddle.net/badasafish/eVnjS/4/
[09:59:17] <Snwspeckle> Ok I got it POST'ing. Now to work on my query
[10:00:05] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: http://jsfiddle.net/badasafish/eVnjS/6/
[10:00:22] <Stephen-B> Hi all, I'm having a problem with the jQuery validation plugin. I have created a JSFiddle and it works fine, but when I include it in my page it refuses to find any of the validation methods in the additional-methods file, can someone here please assist me in debugging this
[10:01:39] <Snwspeckle> Is there a way to perform a _GET request with JQuery?
[10:02:37] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/ remember google is your friend
[10:02:43] <Snwspeckle> If I perform: $.post('templates/sidebar.tpl.php', { userID: '' + userID }); --- Can I get this variable on a PHP page using $_POST['userID']; correct?
[10:04:00] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: I don't use PHP but in principle yes, and your syntax looks sensible
[10:04:52] <Snwspeckle> Yea its proper syntax. Im just not sure why its not working yet
[10:05:32] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: { userID: ‚Äù + userID }) that doesn't look right
[10:05:56] <Snwspeckle> Its passing the ID, I checked it in chrome
[10:05:57] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: Missing closing quote?
[10:06:23] <Snwspeckle> those are ' btw
[10:06:44] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: OK, but still wrong then isn't it?
[10:07:16] <Snwspeckle> No its right. I changed my request to GET. Its properly setting the variable but my PHP isnt
[10:07:20] <Snwspeckle> Receiving it
[10:08:05] <Deno258> Can anyone tell me how can I change this to on mouse over http://jsfiddle.net/EDZGS/ ? :D
[10:08:14] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: I'm sure that's not right, but if you want to ignore my suggestion that's fine
[10:08:33] <Snwspeckle> I looked at what you said, that doesn't seem to be the issue
[10:08:45] <Snwspeckle> I ran a CURL and the string parameters are being passed
[10:09:43] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: If ie your variable was 666, then it would resolve to { userID: ‚Äù666 }, does that look right to you?
[10:10:06] <Snwspeckle> No but this is what is being returned: userID:U99684
[10:10:27] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: surely it should be { userID: " + userID + " }
[10:10:31] <Snwspeckle> The problem is that the request needs to be variable, not a string
[10:10:55] <Snwspeckle> let me try that
[10:11:46] <Stephen-B> Deno258: Are you using jQuery?
[10:11:49] <Snwspeckle> I think my problem is that I am setting the variable with _GET but I then call the modal after that
[10:11:56] <Deno258> I'm not
[10:12:07] <Stephen-B> Deno258: Can you?
[10:12:16] <Deno258> I never used it :D
[10:12:29] <Stephen-B> Deno258: OK, but a solution that uses jQuery is ok?
[10:12:56] <Deno258> It's
[10:13:02] <Deno258> It is*
[10:13:39] <Stephen-B> Deno258: http://jsfiddle.net/badasafish/EDZGS/1/
[10:14:04] <Otineb> air_: Ok figured out what IE wasn't running jquery for me but EVERY OTHER COMPETENT BROWSER WAS. IE doesn't like console.log("derp");
[10:14:05] <Deno258> Thank you :)
[10:14:10] <Deno258> Stephen-B: Thank you :)
[10:14:17] <kokoriko> Hi ! I'm in trouble about ajax requests. My goal is to have 3 dynamic forms. Each form is showed after clicking on a button, an ajax call show the form into a div. This point is ok. However, when i press submit. It automaticly send me to another url and I have no idea why. Should i empty the cache or something like that ?
[10:14:20] <Otineb> removed all those and viola. works like a charm
[10:14:30] <air_> Otineb: oh, yes, been there, done that. :)
[10:14:40] <Otineb> air_: wtf right
[10:14:41] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: Debug your receiving page by just calling it with the URL and querystring and get the variables using the normal _GET
[10:15:03] <air_> Otineb: but it's not a problem really.
[10:15:08] <Stephen-B> kokoriko: Can you show us an example of what you are experiencing?
[10:15:16] <air_> Otineb: I always jslint my files and don't allow that kinda stuff
[10:15:24] <Otineb> air_: jslint?
[10:15:32] <Stephen-B> Hi all, I'm having a problem with the jQuery validation plugin. I have created a JSFiddle and it works fine, but when I include it in my page it refuses to find any of the validation methods in the additional-methods file, can someone here please assist me in debugging this
[10:15:35] <air_> Otineb: so it's not gonna go through unnoticed after debugging.
[10:15:59] <air_> Otineb: http://www.jslint.com/
[10:16:03] <air_> I thought everyone used that
[10:16:06] <Otineb> air_: oooooh
[10:16:10] <Snwspeckle> Well heres the thing. I am setting them with _GET to sidebar.tpl.php. After that I call the modal with bootstrap which loads the sidebar.tpl.php page. I think the issue is that it is not the same instance at when the _GET is set
[10:16:22] <NaudibleMason> kokoriko: might use jquery to set the "action=" attribute of the form to "#", that should stop the default submit to a url
[10:16:26] <Otineb> air_: dude, i'm day 11 of learning jquery. It's amazing btw - just in case you didn't know
[10:16:39] <air_> Otineb: jslint isn't jquery specific, it's for any javascript.
[10:16:52] <air_> Otineb: it's a nice thing, especially if you are several developers.
[10:17:02] <Otineb> air_: omfg wat is this
[10:17:05] <air_> Otineb: what IDE / editor do you use?
[10:17:07] <Otineb> THANK YOU
[10:17:32] <Otineb> dreamweaver for most tasks (overkill i know) or eclipse for others
[10:17:46] <air_> ok. jslint has integrtions into most editors.
[10:17:53] <Otineb> fukin a
[10:17:54] <air_> "lint on save",e tc.
[10:18:30] <air_> I force all my colleges to run default settings and any configs on the first row of each file.
[10:18:41] <air_> so
[10:19:05] <air_> so not problems to validate any existing file. as you open it.
[10:19:20] <Snwspeckle> '
[10:19:47] <Deno258> Stephen-B: How can I make it do same animation but on mouse out it shoud go on top ?
[10:19:55] <Snwspeckle> Can I set a session variable with JQuery?
[10:21:11] <Stephen-B> snwspeckle: not directly, but you can with an AJAX request
[10:22:25] <Otineb> air_: amazing
[10:22:30] <Snwspeckle> Hmm well idk how its not being set
[10:23:01] <Otineb> it's slapping my hand for stuff I thought was totally ok
[10:23:56] <air_> Otineb: well, it's kinda strict, lots of people dislike it for that.
[10:24:18] <air_> Otineb: but if you follow it, it's very easy to identify problems as well.
[10:24:46] <air_> (there is a fork, jshint that allows more things out of the box. and of course, jslint allows you to configure it to do almost anything.)
[10:25:44] <air_> I try to run a minimum configuration, basically, just /*global  $*/
[10:26:24] <Stephen-B> Hi all, I'm having a problem with the jQuery validation plugin. I have created a JSFiddle and it works fine, but when I include it in my page it refuses to find any of the validation methods in the additional-methods file, can someone here please assist me in debugging this
[10:26:51] <air_> Otineb: you probably found this already, but, http://dwlint.abisvmm.nl/
[10:26:57] <Assimilater_Buil> is anyone here happen to be familiar enough with gmaps to tell me why http://dot.aquaveo.com/index.php?q=sMap.php doesn't load now that I'm trying to user regular api and not jquery plugin?
[10:27:58] <Otineb> air_: you're blowing my mind dude. So much to learn
[10:28:27] <air_> :)
[10:28:46] <air_> Otineb: if your'e new to jquery, give this a peek http://try.jquery.com/
[10:28:57] <Otineb> will do
[10:29:07] <Otineb> I'm doing the courses over www.codeacademy.com
[10:33:41] <Snwspeckle> I am performing a _GET request with the JQuery $.get and then opening a modal after but the modal is opening before $.get is fully performed. How can I prevent my modal from opening until the _GET request is complete>
[10:36:09] <NoiseEee> Snwspeckle: callbacks.
[10:36:32] <Stephen-B> Hi all, I'm having a problem with the jQuery validation plugin. I have created a JSFiddle and it works fine, but when I include it in my page it refuses to find any of the validation methods in the additional-methods file, can someone here please assist me in debugging this
[10:37:20] <NoiseEee> 'it refuses' = does it argue?
[10:37:26] <NoiseEee> Stephen-B: what's in your console?
[10:37:47] <NoiseEee> fixingthesejquery.com @ Stephen-B in general
[10:37:52] <NoiseEee> www.fixingthesejquery.com
[10:38:41] <Stephen-B> NoiseEee: Timestamp: 08/04/2013 TypeError: $.validator.methods[method] is undefined
[10:44:38] <Snwspeckle> NoiseEee: With the callbacks, how could I use this so that the PHP script has to be run before anymore javascript is ran?
[10:45:12] <NoiseEee> Snwspeckle: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[10:45:50] <NoiseEee> Snwspeckle: success: function() { //well since the ajax request returned, i guess PHP is done, so time to move on }
[10:45:56] <Snwspeckle> ok
[10:45:57] <icewillc> test
[10:48:34] <Snwspeckle> Is this correct? $.get('classes/doSessionSet.php', { userID: '' + userID }, function(data) { $('#editModal').modal('show'); });
[10:48:36] <Stephen-B> NoiseEee: Any validation functions contained within the main js file are OK, but any that I attempt to use that are from the separate additional-methods cause the above mentioned error
[10:49:19] <Stephen-B> snwspeckle: Still persevering with: userID: ‚Äù + userID  i see
[10:49:30] <Snwspeckle> Stephen-B: It works
[10:49:38] <Snwspeckle> I triple checked it, the data is being passed
[10:49:48] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: OK
[10:50:07] <Snwspeckle> My problem right now is that the userID is not being set before the modal is shown so that PHP script in the modal isn't being run
[10:50:12] <Snwspeckle> Thus the modal is empty
[10:50:23] <Snwspeckle> I need the userID be set before the modal is shown
[10:50:43] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: How are you setting the userID?
[10:51:08] <Snwspeckle> I call doSessionSet and do $_SESSION['userID'] = $_GET['userID']
[10:51:30] <Stephen-B> OK, then how does that get back to the page to show up in the modal popup?
[10:51:31] <eddiemonge> Snwspeckle: you arent returning the data from the php into the modal
[10:51:40] <eddiemonge> and why the '' + userId?
[10:51:56] <Stephen-B> eddiemonge: thankyou, ive been saying that for 30 minutes :P
[10:52:14] <Snwspeckle> At the top of the modal page I have PHP which sets the session variable of userID to a local variable of userID
[10:52:41] <Snwspeckle> eddie: I have '' because the parameter accepts a string and I need a variable passed so I have an empty string appended with the variable
[10:53:03] <eddiemonge> Snwspeckle: modal page?
[10:53:13] <Stephen-B> snwspeckle: can we see what you are trying to do?
[10:53:26] <eddiemonge> Snwspeckle: you know an empty string plus a string is the same thing as saying 0 plus a number. not necessary
[10:54:29] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: do you have a link so we can see what's happening?
[10:54:49] <eddiemonge> and i think your GET should be a POST since you are setting data
[10:55:27] <Stephen-B> they can both be used to set data right? just differ in how they pass their parameters?
[10:55:51] <Stephen-B> get appends it to the querystring whilst POST does it all in secret
[10:56:09] <Snwspeckle> Its all local atm
[10:56:22] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: well that's not very helpful :P
[10:56:29] <Snwspeckle> Im at school lol
[10:56:49] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: Can you describe an overview of what you are trying to achieve?
[10:56:54] <eddiemonge> semantically get is for getting data, not setting it. setting it is post or put
[10:57:29] <Snwspeckle> When you click the "Edit" button, it sets the rows ID into a session so that when the modal is loaded, it uses that ID to query my database and output the information of that row
[10:57:38] <Snwspeckle> I am using bootstrap, a modal is basically and overlay window
[10:57:46] <Snwspeckle> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#modals
[10:58:03] <Stephen-B> OK, so you need to update the HTML in the model to reflect the data that has been set in the session
[10:58:26] <Snwspeckle> I need the modal to not be performed until the session set is complete
[10:58:27] <Stephen-B> your get request should return this html/data which you can then insert into the modal
[10:58:33] <Snwspeckle> The problem is that the modal is showing before its set
[10:58:52] <Stephen-B> do you know that, or is it just not being set?
[10:59:06] <Snwspeckle> Well on my modal page, I use the ID to perform a PHP query and I am almost positive thats the issue
[10:59:38] <Snwspeckle> Currently if I click edit the modal loads with it being empty. If I refresh the page, the sessions variable is currently set so it will load data
[10:59:55] <Snwspeckle> I think the issue also may be that the page needs refreshed before the session can be set?
[11:00:02] <eddiemonge> Snwspeckle: when is your modal generated? is it pulling in external data like its an iframe?
[11:00:21] <Snwspeckle> The modal is loaded with a table that is from a PHP query
[11:00:42] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: your php code in the modal is executed when the page is loaded
[11:00:49] <Snwspeckle> yes
[11:01:25] <eddiemonge> Stephen-B: you should be returning the information from the ajax request and then populating the modal with that info
[11:01:34] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: you need your external script that sets the session variable to perform the PHP query, get the data from the database and return the HTML for this which you can then insert into the modal window before it's shown
[11:02:09] <eddiemonge> ugh you both have names beginning with S and my autocomplete is getting confused
[11:02:23] <Stephen-B> wish I had autocomplete
[11:02:28] <Snwspeckle> I found the issue. The get request is being performed but since the page is not being refreshed before the modal is presented, the client doesn't know that the session is not set
[11:02:46] <Snwspeckle> If I refresh the page and hit edit, the modal will load with content because the session is now set
[11:03:01] <eddiemonge> Stephen-B: what client do you use?
[11:03:06] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: indeed but that's not how you want it to work?
[11:03:12] <eddiemonge> Snwspeckle: omg you are not listening
[11:03:20] <Stephen-B> eddiemonge: ChatZilla in firefox
[11:03:34] <eddiemonge> Stephen-B: why not use an actual client? OS?
[11:03:35] <Snwspeckle> I want it so that when you hit edit, the session is set and then the modal is presented and can display the data from the query
[11:03:45] <Snwspeckle> no refresh needed
[11:03:53] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: well i just outlined how to achieve that
[11:03:59] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: you need your external script that sets the session variable to perform the PHP query, get the data from the database and return the HTML for this which you can then insert into the modal window before it's shown
[11:04:14] <Snwspeckle> It doesn't work like that
[11:04:36] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: well it will if you want to achieve what you have outlined
[11:04:52] <Snwspeckle> doSessionSet has 1 goal, and that is to set the userID into a session. The modal code performs its own PHP queries with the userID session variable
[11:05:36] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: It's very difficult to understand what you are trying to do without seeing it
[11:05:40] <Snwspeckle> Heres my modal code so you can better understand: http://pastebin.com/PNn93Q7M
[11:06:08] <Stephen-B> eddiemonge: I don't normally use IRC, this was just the closest thing to hand
[11:06:11] <eddiemonge> Snwspeckle: so you want to do ajax without the ajax part?
[11:06:46] <Snwspeckle> Ok actually you can connect to it
[11:06:47] <Snwspeckle> http://10.96.5.207/Hiskor_Admin_New/manageUsers.php
[11:06:54] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: You need to call that script via an ajax call
[11:06:58] <Snwspeckle> The username is: anthony@example.com and the password is: password
[11:07:16] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: Currently its just running that script on the server before anything happens on the page hence it knows nothing about the session variable
[11:07:22] <Snwspeckle> Once you login you'll be on the manageUsers page. Click the arrow at options and click edit
[11:07:47] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: TBH I grasp it now, you don't seem to be understanding what I'm telling you
[11:07:59] <Snwspeckle> Did you login and see the issue?
[11:08:38] <Stephen-B> link doesn't work
[11:08:48] <Snwspeckle> Really?
[11:08:56] <Snwspeckle> Probably filtered out
[11:08:59] <Stephen-B> just hangs, no 404 or anything
[11:09:01] <Stephen-B> yup
[11:09:12] <Snwspeckle> its the school network blocking u
[11:09:12] <Snwspeckle> darn
[11:09:18] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: Do you understand what I'm telling you?
[11:09:24] <NoiseEee> Snwspeckle: your problem is a common, basic issue
[11:09:33] <NoiseEee> Snwspeckle: callbacks have been mentioned infinite times now
[11:09:38] <NoiseEee> Snwspeckle: go. do.  it.
[11:09:40] <Snwspeckle> I am performing a callback
[11:10:22] <NoiseEee> are you familiar with debugging?  how to see what was passed and what was returned in an xhr/ajax call?
[11:10:35] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: First AJAX request sets session, then you need a second AJAX request to generate and return the content for the modal
[11:11:31] <Snwspeckle> Why do I need that when I tell my code to perform editModal when the callback is a success
[11:11:38] <Snwspeckle> That is the content for the modal
[11:12:54] <eddiemonge> Snwspeckle: because your modal is static once the page has loaded
[11:13:00] <eddiemonge> thats the part you are missing
[11:13:15] <Stephen-B> someone shot me
[11:13:16] <eddiemonge> you need to generate the content for the modal since when it is "called" it is not refreshed
[11:13:16] <Snwspeckle> The modal is loaded when I click the edit button, not when the page loads
[11:13:19] <Stephen-B> *shoot
[11:13:23] <eddiemonge> Snwspeckle: no, its not
[11:13:25] <guideX> is there some way to show a div which is hidden, but delay a little?
[11:13:45] <Snwspeckle> Yes it is. The modal is not called until I click the edit button
[11:13:45] <eddiemonge> unless it has an iframe or bootstrap is performing another ajax which i didnt see you have it doing
[11:13:58] <eddiemonge> guideX: yeah. setTimeout
[11:14:03] <Stephen-B> snwspeckle: Show the code for the click please
[11:14:13] <Snwspeckle> <a data-toggle=\"modal\" data-userID=\"{$result['userID']}\" class=\"open-EditUser\" href=\"#editUserModal\">
[11:14:15] <eddiemonge> Snwspeckle: inspect your page. look at the modal. does it have content?
[11:14:33] <Snwspeckle> Oh it is there
[11:14:34] <Snwspeckle> My bad...
[11:14:44] <Snwspeckle> So I need to refresh the modal after I click the edit button right?
[11:15:02] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: Modal is just a div right?
[11:15:07] <Snwspeckle> yes
[11:15:17] <Snwspeckle> I have multiple modals but I see what your saying'
[11:15:31] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: You can't just refresh a div, you have to make an ajax call to return the content to "refresh" the div
[11:15:36] <Snwspeckle> the modals are loaded on the page when its loaded, I need to refresh them when I click the button though so that they have content
[11:15:52] <eddiemonge> do you need to set the sessionid? cant your ajax request just return the needed information?
[11:16:15] <Snwspeckle> The current Ajax is used to set the session variable
[11:16:18] <Stephen-B> eddiemonge: I believe i suggested that about 3 lifetimes ago :P
[11:16:29] <Snwspeckle> When I call the modal div, its to perform the PHP query
[11:16:41] <guideX> how do I mix settimeout with .show()?
[11:16:45] <guideX> I can't seem to figure it out
[11:17:16] <Snwspeckle> So basically I need to refresh the page after the session is set
[11:17:48] <eddiemonge> guideX: setTimeout(function() { yourelement.show(); }, 2000)
[11:17:49] <Stephen-B> Snwspeckle: Simplify things, you don't need more than one ajax request, just use the one to set the session, retrieve the data, return the html and then put this html into the modal div and hey presto
[11:18:05] <eddiemonge> Snwspeckle: omg stop, just stop. lets start from the very beginning. what is your question?
[11:18:18] <guideX> oh cool thanks eddie
[11:18:25] <Stephen-B> Sorry, I've had enough of this, good luck all
[11:18:48] <Snwspeckle> So I set the session, then I need to call the editModal's PHP to retrieve the data and re-present it
[11:19:04] <Snwspeckle> I just want to reload editModal before I present it then
[11:19:13] <guideX> cool it worked, thanks a million eddie:
[11:19:18] <eddiemonge> Snwspeckle: you are being difficult and making it hard for us to help you
[11:19:22] <Snwspeckle> I gtg anyway
[11:19:26] <Snwspeckle> Ill try again tomorrow
[11:19:35] <Stadtpirat> Hi. I have a question about Jquery UI Autocomplete. http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote  How do I set the key the widget is sending to search.php? For example 'search.php?myOwnKey=...'?
[11:19:57] <NoiseEee> vampire
[11:22:10] <eddiemonge> Stadtpirat: either by extending the widget to include your own but it might just be easier to have your BE accept term as the key
[11:23:03] <Stadtpirat> eddiemonge, nope, I absoluetly need a custom key. Is there nothing like "key:"myownkey" option?
[11:25:01] <RobOakes> Is there an official or "preferred" client side templating library that can be used with jQuery?
[11:26:00] <eddiemonge> RobOakes: not really. there used to be but not anymore really.
[11:27:16] <RobOakes> eddiemonge: Okay, that's good to know. What I need is pretty simple, so I'll probably just roll my own.
[11:29:05] <eddiemonge> Stadtpirat: you would need to extend the widget so it uses your own term here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.js#L417
[11:29:54] <Stadtpirat> sorry, too complicated for me.
[11:30:19] <eddiemonge> Stadtpirat: why cant you modify your script then?
[11:32:01] <Stadtpirat> eddiemonge, I am no Javascripter. I have no idea what you send me. I understand basic stuff like changing 'source: "search.php",' to 'mysearch.php'. Thats all
[11:32:53] <Stadtpirat> I thought it might something be like: "key:'mykey'" sad to see its not.
[11:32:55] * Stadtpirat shrugs
[11:33:09] <eddiemonge> Stadtpirat: what do you do then?
[11:36:48] <zergion> is it just me or is jsfiddle and jsbin retarded pastebins? I can't even copy or select text

[11:37:15] <eddiemonge> works fine for me
[11:37:40] <zergion> doesn't do well in chrome. I can see now it works in firefox
[11:37:55] <zergion> wierd they wouldnt add support for the one of the largest browsers
[11:38:19] <eddiemonge> it is supported, very well
[11:38:25] <eddiemonge> thats the only place i use it, normally
[11:38:33] <eddiemonge> must be your chrome.
[11:38:41] <eddiemonge> have you tried turning it off and on again?
[11:39:16] <Phoenixz> What could cause jquery mobile pages not to show until I click the screen? I see the header, footer, but no content.. until I click the screen (on iPhone)

[11:42:14] <jobelenus> JQM question, I'm trying to replace my footer navigation on one single page‚Ä¶ my first thought was to hide the current footer nav, and then build another.. am i off on my approach, or will that possibly work?
[11:46:29] <Otineb> zergion: I use jsfiddle exclusively with Chrome. Works fine for me
[11:47:16] <Otineb> eddiemonge: "have you tried turning it off and on again?" hahahaha

[11:56:21] <masentinel900> Guys someone could help me with that !!
[11:57:24] <masentinel900> I need to set inside Js var "aData" the php var "$detailsProy = $row['nameIteSec'];"
[11:59:04] <eddiemonge> so much code
[11:59:32] <jobelenus> hey, i can't seem to hide a jQM footer on one page.. anyone know how I can do that?
[12:01:24] <Assimilater_Buil> this appears to be the correct format for catching ajax errors from the docs $.ajax({data}).done(function(html) { do stuff }).fail(function() { $(project).html('There was an error with the server. Please try again'); } but when I intentionally throw in a php error it doesn't update the html, though I can see the error in the console. Did I miss the setup?
[12:02:07] <Otineb> @eddiemonge : the best episode yet was when Roy and Moss go see "Gay! A Musical". When Moss turned around behind the bar I f*king lost it
[12:02:10] <NaudibleMason> join #raspberrypi
[12:02:59] <eddiemonge> Assimilater_Buil: what is the error? what version of jq?
[12:03:10] <eddiemonge> NaudibleMason: no
[12:03:32] <NaudibleMason> lol, sry
[12:03:34] <Assimilater_Buil> eddiemonge: I'm on jquery 1.9.1, it's a syntax error I threw in intentionally
[12:04:05] <eddiemonge> it needs to return http status code error
[12:04:51] <Assimilater_Buil> is there a way to catch for any error?
[12:05:17] <eddiemonge> done
[12:05:32] <eddiemonge> sorry meant always
[12:05:48] <Assimilater_Buil> i see
[12:09:00] <Assimilater_Buil> it would appear that the error stops javascript execution, so just don't leave syntax errors on the site, I suppose
[12:09:20] <Assimilater_Buil> would fail() catch if there was no connection to the server?
[12:11:19] <Assimilater_Buil> it would appear so
[12:17:08] <synk> learning jquery/json, the API I'm getting data from has '2 pages' currently showing only 1 how do i call the second page from the same query (form)
[12:17:34] <synk> e.g., showing 25 of 50 records, the next 25 are on 'page2'.
[12:18:20] <eddiemonge> depends on how you are making the call
[12:18:36] <eddiemonge> are you using an offset or calling something like /page/2 ?
[12:19:13] <synk> by default it shows unto 25 records, if more then would have to call &page2
[12:19:29] <synk> so question is how do I go to page2 after the search input is run
[12:21:39] <eddiemonge> synk: is the user requesting page2? or you want to load them all at once?
[12:22:01] <synk> prefer to load all at once
[12:22:35] <synk> or user can "go to page 2". only 25 records are shown max per query
[12:23:20] <eddiemonge> synk: you should change your back end then to accept a limit and a offset so you can provide more per request
[12:30:15] <jobelenus> is there a way to hide the footer on a JQM page? I'm using fixed footers for transitions, and on one page i dont want the footer
[12:32:15] <prkchp_sndwch> I'm having trouble using $.getJSON to load a .json file on my server and set the parsed object of that to a local file. I've tried $.getJSON("http://mydomain.com/file.json", some_global_js_object); does anyone know waht I'm doing wrong?
[12:33:03] <greeek> hello can i ask an var in onclick of an anchor tag and then sent it to php script as parameter?
[12:33:33] <eddiemonge> prkchp_sndwch: huh? first, use a local url, second, have you read the api docs on that?
[12:33:38] <greeek> somethink like this var<a onclick="var tmp=prompt('gimme text');" href="test.php?id=yep&test=tmp">click</a>
[12:33:45] <eddiemonge> greeek: eww
[12:33:48] <eddiemonge> dont use onclick
[12:34:37] <greeek> but is it possible, that example doesn't work thou
[12:35:13] <eddiemonge> greeek: not really. its dirty. why would you want to?
[12:35:58] <greeek> obviously i need to get one value from user
[12:37:05] <prkchp_sndwch> eddiemonge, read the api already. I'm trying to figure out if this is possible right now using the globals. I know it's not pretty but for now it will work for what I need it to do.
[12:37:09] <eddiemonge> thats not obvious.
[12:37:20] <prkchp_sndwch> is it a possibility at all to do this?
[12:37:28] <eddiemonge> prkchp_sndwch: what are you trying to do exactly?
[12:37:47] <eddiemonge> prkchp_sndwch: get json and store it as a variable?
[12:37:53] <prkchp_sndwch> eddiemonge, yes
[12:38:35] <djave> Can anyone help me add a callback to my plugin I've been making?
[12:38:36] <djave> http://codepen.io/sheepysheep60/pen/pLdwx
[12:38:42] <eddiemonge> prkchp_sndwch: why does it have to be a global variable?
[12:39:35] <eddiemonge> prkchp_sndwch: generally though you would do: $.getJSON('url', function(response) { varName = respone; });
[12:39:46] <prkchp_sndwch> eddiemonge, I'm using a lot of other functions that use this returned JSON data. I shall refactor later.
[12:40:01] <prkchp_sndwch> I've also tried giving it that function too, but that didn't work either
[12:40:20] <greeek> how do i get an invite into php channe?
[12:40:29] <eddiemonge> djave: have you tried googling it? see ? lmgtfy jquery plugin add callback
[12:40:30] <bot-t> djave, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=
[12:40:36] <greeek> is javascript channel gone secret too?
[12:40:58] <eddiemonge> prkchp_sndwch: did you put var varName or just varName?
[12:41:19] <eddiemonge> greeek: ##php #javascript
[12:41:38] <eddiemonge> sorry, js is ##javascript
[12:42:03] <greeek> it says cannotsend to channel
[12:42:23] <prkchp_sndwch> eddiemonge, realized what the problem is. I double checked the console and found that the json is returned after there is an error saying the global is missing.
[12:42:26] <greeek> and php says it's invite only, sigh
[12:42:30] <shoky> greeek: /msg nickserv help register
[12:42:34] <prkchp_sndwch> it was an async problem all along. thanks for your help.

[13:54:32] <Zitter> I've tried, I think it is JQuery. node.append('<li>'); node.append('other_tags'); node.append('</li>') it causes <li></li><other_tags>
[13:54:49] <Zitter> and maybe it is logical

[14:01:04] <aberrant> hi all
[14:01:12] <aberrant> what's the difference between after() and append()?
[14:03:05] <NoiseEee> aberrant: you appendTo a node/element, and with after() you're put it AFTER the element (ie: appending to the parent)
[14:03:22] <aberrant> ah, ok
[14:03:23] <air_> aberrant: http://api.jquery.com/append/ + http://api.jquery.com/after/
[14:03:25] <aberrant> that makes sense
[14:03:28] <air_> see the examples.
[14:03:50] <air_> (since they use same html, it's really easy to compare and notice the difference)
[14:12:38] <edelFr0st> hey all! I posted a problem I'm having @ https://forum.jquery.com/topic/accordion-bxslider
[14:12:47] <lemarc> i have this piece of code http://pastebin.com/nVMJG9MA, the problem is the call back function inside the animate function is not being executed, i dont know whats the problem, m not getting any error in console
[14:12:58] <edelFr0st> Would appreciate any help
[14:22:10] <lemarc> i have this piece of code http://pastebin.com/nVMJG9MA, the problem is the call back function inside the animate function is not being executed, i dont know whats the problem, m not getting any error in console
[14:30:16] <shoky> lemarc: check the docs for .animate(), if you use .animate(properties, options)  you have to supply the callback in the options object as "complete"
[14:30:56] <lemarc> sholy, its working now, thanks for the help :)
[14:43:54] <Phoenixz> What could cause jquery mobile pages not to show until I click the screen? I see the header, footer, but no content.. until I click the screen (on iPhone)
[14:44:21] <Phoenixz> Checking the same thing on desktop, it works normally.. Same for Android.. Only iPhone shows the problem
[15:04:58] <Caelum> webkit lets me scroll the window to an element within an iframe, IE does not
[15:05:08] <Caelum> fuck you IE, once again
[15:05:20] <Caelum> fuck you very hard
[15:48:22] <UniZero> Sorry to ask here, but does anyone know of a channel where SCSS/SASS/LESS is discussed?
[15:50:48] <vacho> gents..
[15:50:56] <vacho> $('#accumulated-request thead tr')
[15:51:14] <vacho> I want to target only the first thead and tr...not all theads and tr's
[15:51:16] <vacho> is it possibe?
[15:53:47] <holodoc> UniZero: #sass
[15:56:59] <MikesBarto2002> When I click the new plus button created, a new row isn't created. Any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/tQQQT/
[15:58:00] <UniZero> holodoc: Thanks!
[15:59:32] <Phoenixz> What could cause jquery mobile pages not to show until I click the screen? I see the header, footer, but no content.. until I click the screen (on iPhone)
[15:59:34] <Phoenixz> Checking the same thing on desktop, it works normally.. Same for Android.. Only iPhone shows the problem
[16:00:44] <MikesBarto2002> Anyone? http://jsfiddle.net/tQQQT/
[16:01:10] <vacho> $('#accumulated-request thead tr') ....how can I tell jquery to only attach the first thead??? I have a table in a table so it created a problem for me
[16:05:48] <tw2113> ?first-child
[16:05:51] <bot-t> :first-child: Selects all elements that are the first child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/first-child-selector/
[16:07:46] <Caelum> is there something like an .isIE function?
[16:07:59] <Caelum> I don't have time to fix this particular IE retardation
[16:08:41] <UniZero> Caelum: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
[16:08:42] <Susan> jQuery.browser, I imagine.
[16:08:47] <Susan> Damn, beaten.
[16:08:49] <UniZero> lol
[16:08:53] <Caelum> thank you!
[16:09:00] <Susan> https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=internet%20explorer%20check%20jquery
[16:09:02] <Susan> ;-)
[16:09:54] <tw2113> note .browser is REMOVED in 1.9
[16:10:00] <tw2113> because it was never all that great
[16:10:04] <Caelum> oh right
[16:10:07] <Caelum> I'm using 1.9
[16:10:10] <tw2113> version deprecated: 1.3, removed: 1.9
[16:10:12] <UniZero> Depending on what functionality you're looking for, you might also want to look into conditional CSS
[16:10:43] <Caelum> but there is a browser plugin that puts it back
[16:10:48] <Caelum> which I'm using for another plugin
[16:10:56] <tw2113> because putting crap back in is awesom
[16:10:56] <tw2113> e
[16:11:16] <Caelum> it's not awesome at all, but I just needed that particular plugin to work
[16:11:30] <tw2113> shouldn't the plugin author fix that
[16:11:41] <UniZero> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#jquery-browser-removed
[16:11:55] <Caelum> the plugin author made it pop up an alert that said "load the browser plugin"
[16:12:52] <Caelum> hah, it recommends using Modernizr which I'm also using
[16:13:15] <tw2113> what is this plugin's purpose again
[16:13:19] <tw2113> the one you're trying to bandaid
[16:13:36] <Caelum> I'm not, it works fine, I need to check for IE for a completely different reason
[16:14:09] <UniZero> Are you trying to initiate a popup that tells people to upgrade from IE?
[16:14:40] <Caelum> heh
[16:14:46] <Caelum> I wish
[16:20:14] <UniZero> That would be too easy :P
[16:21:03] <Caelum> so anyone seen this problem, in IE, after an iframe reloads (on form submission, to same page) $('#iframe').contents() returns 'permission denied'
[16:21:31] <Caelum> I tried setting x-frame-options header to SAMEORIGIN, didn't help
[16:21:46] <Caelum> maybe I need to set a CORS header
[16:23:09] <Caelum> nah that wouldn't help
[16:23:26] <Caelum> boss wants to deploy my "stuff" now, so horrible ie check hack it is
[16:43:43] <Caelum> this is interesting
[16:43:49] <Caelum> if I do:
[16:45:28] <Caelum> $($('#content_iframe')[0].contentWindow.document.body).height() then I don't get a permission denied error
[16:45:39] <Caelum> something broken in jquery guts
[16:54:23] <Caelum> HAH IT WORKS
[16:54:35] <Caelum> I'll send a pullreq to the iframe-auto-height author tonight
[16:55:48] <apneic> I have a div with overflow: auto on, and with enough content, there's a scroll bar, which is intended.  I have an ajax request that replaces the content in that div, which works correctly.  However, if I was scrolled down in the div at all, simply replacing the html doesn't jump to the top of the new content, which is what i want.  Anyone have any ideas on how to accomplish this?
[16:56:15] <nesoi> does anyone know how I can stop tap events from triggering things other than what I want them to? For instance, if I tap on something and that launches a popup (simpledialog2), buttons in the popup over where I tapped will also get a tap event.
[16:56:33] <nesoi> similarly, if I tap on the dialog, things under the dialog buttons (a listview) will get a tap event
[16:57:06] <nesoi> I've tried stopImmediatePropagation and stopPropagation and return false, but it still happens.
[16:58:47] <Caelum> apneic: have your ajax handler set the scroll position
[16:58:59] <Caelum> now my iframe is disappearing in ie8
[16:59:01] <Caelum> wtf
[16:59:08] <blickety> apneic - .scrollTop()?
[16:59:57] <Caelum> was a temporary fluke
[16:59:58] <nesoi> so no one has any idea how to stop these rogue events?
[17:00:39] <YammYcoding> hello folks! I added some <a href="foo.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[]"> to my images, it works, but is showing the url on top of the zoomed picture. Any idea to remove that?
[17:00:49] <YammYcoding> (the image url)
[17:01:28] <apneic> Caelum blickety: Oh, I tried that but neglected to put a value in.  I was just returning the scroll position instead of setting it.  Thanks.
[17:09:19] <Caelum> k
[17:14:26] <Caelum> sorry, something about this terminal seems to sometimes send random crap to my irssi
[17:24:58] <coldhead> what will happen to that story telling clown
[17:28:54] <edelFr0st> hey all! I posted a problem I'm having @ https://forum.jquery.com/topic/accordion-bxslider help would be greatly appreciated
[17:30:13] <nesoi> what's the difference between .bind and .on?
[17:38:42] <vacho> how do I target this
[17:38:49] <vacho> <tr data-type="test">...</tr>
[17:39:23] <coldhead> $('tr[data-type="test"]')
[17:39:35] <coldhead> but it would be better just to add a class
[17:39:48] <vacho> thx
[17:43:49] <YammYcoding> guys, how to remove that url on top of the picture, when you click a prettyPhoto thumbnail?
[17:46:18] <YammYcoding> or pass another value to it ?
[17:48:44] <vladikoff> YammYcoding, show_title: false in options
[17:50:10] <YammYcoding> aah thank you so!
[17:57:36] <nesoi> in jquery, if I have something like <a  data-role="button" data-mini="true" data-inline="true" id="b-123">Hello</a> how do I extract the "Hello"?
[18:03:28] <nesoi> hm. no one is here or no one who knows anything is here? :)
[18:03:45] <tw2113> we're all bacon obsessed bots
[18:04:08] <nesoi> oh no!
[18:04:30] <nesoi> tw2113 : do you know the answer to what I asked?
[18:04:32] <tw2113> i'm the only self aware one
[18:04:36] <cincyguy5646> can anyone tell me how to add a primary and second ui-icon to an accordion widget in jquery ui
[18:04:39] <tw2113> i don't even know what you asked
[18:05:13] <nesoi> in jquery, if I have something like <a  data-role="button" data-mini="true" data-inline="true" id="b-123">Hello</a> how do I extract the "Hello"?
[18:05:24] <nesoi> that's what I asked tw2113!
[18:05:37] <tw2113> .html()
[18:05:40] <shoky> nesoi: if jquery mobile has been through it, you can do $('#b-123 .ui-btn-text').text()
[18:05:50] <cincyguy5646> $("#b-123").text
[18:06:00] <tw2113> or what they said
[18:06:02] <cincyguy5646> $("#b-123").text();
[18:06:08] <nesoi> .text!
[18:06:17] <nesoi> I was trying .value
[18:06:19] <nesoi> :(
[18:06:19] <tw2113> behold the almighty .text!
[18:06:36] <shoky> er ya for getting the text you dont need the .ui-btn-text
[18:06:44] <shoky> but you'd need that for setting
[18:07:05] <cincyguy5646> you dont need the ui-btn-text unless you want to go "that specific"
[18:07:26] <shoky> if you want to set the text, you need it
[18:08:04] <nesoi> cool, that works
[18:08:17] <nesoi> I solved my other problem it seems, by using on rather than delegate, which is odd
[18:08:39] <cincyguy5646> what version of jquery?
[18:09:29] <nesoi> 1.8.3
[18:10:37] <cincyguy5646> $("#accordion").tabs({ header: "ui-icon-arrow-n", activeHeader: "ui-icon-arrow-s"} ); how do i add a "secondary" icon to the header/activeheader?
[18:11:47] <nesoi> so if I have an event on a div containing, say, 50 buttons, why would it take a long time for that event to trigger?
[18:11:53] <nesoi> or how could I speed it up?
[18:12:00] <cincyguy5646> use traversal nesoi
[18:12:10] <cincyguy5646> are you using pseudo selectors?
[18:12:56] <nesoi> cincyguy5646 : traversal? I'm using the div ID
[18:13:11] <nesoi> like $('#recipientsList').on('tap', '.ui-btn', function(e){
[18:14:08] <cincyguy5646> did you use e.StopPropagate()?
[18:14:12] <nesoi> cincyguy5646 : is there something else I should do?
[18:14:23] <cincyguy5646> err stopPropagate..
[18:14:30] <nesoi> I used stopImmediatePropagation()
[18:15:04] <nesoi> and I return false... was getting events going elsewhere otherwise. One or the other may work though, I haven't tested them
[18:15:17] <nesoi> seperately
[18:15:32] <cincyguy5646> I would need to see code I guess..
[18:16:20] <nesoi> it's just: $( document ).on("pageinit", "#message-page", function() { $('#recipientsList').on('tap', '.ui-btn', function(e){ and then the popup code
[18:16:33] <nesoi> which is fast elsewhere
[18:17:06] <cincyguy5646> any faster in other browsers?
[18:17:38] <nesoi> this is android phonegap code, so I can't test other browsers :(
[18:17:56] <cincyguy5646> i use chrome/FF
[18:17:59] <nesoi> but where its popping up over a listview it's fast
[18:18:08] <nesoi> and where it's popping up over a bunch of buttons it's slow
[18:18:21] <nesoi> I can't because it's using data that's only on the phone
[18:18:26] <cincyguy5646> ohok
[18:20:39] <cincyguy5646> nasoi try removing box shadow
[18:20:43] <cincyguy5646> nesoi
[18:20:59] <nesoi> cincyguy5646:
[18:21:15] <cincyguy5646> sorry
[18:21:22] <cincyguy5646> try removing box-shadow
[18:21:53] <nesoi> not sure how to do that
[18:21:59] <nesoi> I don't think it's on
[18:22:01] <tw2113> it's a css thing
[18:22:30] <cincyguy5646> * {box-shadow: none;}
[18:24:34] <nesoi> it doesn't seem to have a shadow actually
[18:28:29] <cincyguy5646> nesoi read this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14468659/jquery-mobile-document-ready-vs-page-events
[18:34:43] <nesoi> is there a way to turn off all events for a certain # of ms?
[18:36:34] <cincyguy5646> $("#accordion").accordian({ header: "ui-icon-arrow-n", activeHeader: "ui-icon-arrow-s"} ); how do i add a "secondary" icon to the header/activeheader?
[18:38:14] <nesoi> damn I thought I had it fixed, but tap on a button in a popup is also triggering whatever is under the popup
[18:38:31] <nesoi> I have stopImmediatePropagation and stopPropagation, and it is still propagating
[18:38:36] <nesoi> any hints or ideas?
[18:39:26] <cincyguy5646> preventDefault?
[18:39:30] <nesoi> I need to throw away the tap after getting it, but somehow it's not going away
[18:40:45] <nesoi> thanks cincyguy5646 let's see if it works!
[18:42:54] <nesoi> cincyguy5646 : didn't work
[18:43:44] <cincyguy5646> e.preventDefault()
[18:43:52] <nesoi> a click when the popup was over a textarea selected the textarea
[18:45:09] <nesoi> hmm.. maybe it partially worked. if the popup is over another button it isn't triggering it
[18:45:13] <nesoi> only if it's over the textarea
[18:45:56] <nesoi> any other things to try?>
[18:46:37] <cincyguy5646> yes one sec
[18:47:32] <cincyguy5646> 5 minutes brb
[19:06:14] <nesoi> so... anyone else have any idea how to stop a click on a popup from also clicking a textarea below it?
[19:06:34] <nesoi> I've tried stopImmediatePropagation, stopPropagation, and preventDefault
[19:09:27] <nesoi> where are the jquery expertz???
[19:10:26] <achmode> is there a site on the net that responds to a json request sent from any client?
[19:13:41] <dAnjou> achmode: http://httpbin.org/ ..?
[19:14:17] <dAnjou> capeta: FYI, your cloak isn't correctly setup
[19:15:15] <nesoi> dAnjou : do you have any idea how to stop a click on a popup from being seen by a textarea which happens to be below the place clicked?
[19:15:25] <nesoi> or rather, under
[19:15:26] <capeta> ty dAnjou
[19:15:42] <nesoi> or capeta or anyone?
[19:16:37] <dAnjou> i'd think by handling the click
[19:17:07] <nesoi> I'm handling the click, and also have stopImmediatePropagation, stopPropagation and preventDefault
[19:17:10] <nesoi> within the click handler
[19:17:31] <dAnjou> don't know ... and it's way too late here
[19:17:34] <achmode> dAnjou, awesome
[19:18:41] <nesoi> one of you ninjas have to know something!
[19:20:14] <nesoi> ok bbl
[19:45:39] <enerel> hi all, i have working jquery script but suddenly i am receiving error TypeError: event.stopImmediatePropagation is not a functionevent.stopImmediatePropagation();
[19:45:46] <enerel> any idea why this is happening?
[19:49:27] <nickmeagher> Can you link to script?
[19:56:34] <autibyte> How can a jQuery event listener function get access to the member attribute of the object it is in? E.g. http://jsfiddle.net/SGeHs/, why doesn't this.message work?
[19:57:38] <enerel> nickmeagher: it is admin panel
[19:58:42] <nickmeagher> this isn't referring to the object
[19:59:04] <nickmeagher> its referring to #say-button
[20:00:49] <autibyte> nickmeagher: Ah, I see. I can fix the problem by adding "var self = this;" within say_hello(), but is there another way to make "this" local in every function? Seems pretty clunky.
[20:02:20] <nickmeagher> hm im not sure
[20:02:33] <nickmeagher> I think you can specify the context of this with .call() or .apply()
[20:03:18] <autibyte> nickmeagher: Oh, how would that work? Best I've found is http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1081499/accessing-an-objects-property-from-an-event-listener-call-in-javascript, which just restates the solution I've found.
[20:03:54] <nickmeagher> hm
[20:04:00] <enerel> nickmeagher: are you saying to me?
[20:04:08] <mehwork> how come 'use strict'; breaks my jquery $ variables? e.g., $var = $('#foo'); will give me errors ?
[20:04:37] <mehwork> actually it breaks it even without $. this breaks too: var = $('#foo');
[20:05:01] <autibyte> mehwork: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10263280/whats-the-proper-way-to-use-jquery-in-conjunction-with-use-strict
[20:06:24] <mehwork> thansk
[20:13:26] <mehwork> autibyte: that actually doesn't work for me though
[20:13:56] <juxta> I am new to jquery/js - if I want to load data from a URL and assign to a variable 'xx' can I use something like var xx = load(URL)?
[20:14:02] <mehwork> and it works when i take out 'use strict';
[20:15:09] <autibyte> juxta: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[20:16:12] <juxta> autibyte: yeah, that was what I was reading - that seems to be to manipulate a div etc directly - can I load the output into a variable?
[20:17:18] <mehwork> juxta: yeah but it returns a jquery object
[20:17:56] <juxta> mehwork: hmm. is there a basic guide I can read to get started?
[20:18:00] <autibyte> mehwork: Hmm... I'm not really sure, I thought of that SO post when I saw 'use strict' and usually it's worked.
[20:18:30] <mehwork> juxta: http://api.jquery.com/Types/#jQuery
[20:19:23] <autibyte> juxta: Ok, just use $.get: $.get("test.php", function(data){ var myvar = data; });
[20:20:06] <juxta> thanks mehwork, autibyte :-)

[22:19:27] <radiantstatic> I'm attempting to create (or find) a search/filter plugin that operates similar to this - http://i.imgur.com/76ilJ7g.png . As more things are chosen, the search is narrowed. Anyone have any suggestions on anything pre-built or  ideas on something similar?
[22:20:19] <edelFr0st> hey all! I posted a problem I'm having @ https://forum.jquery.com/topic/accordion-bxslider help would be greatly appreciated
[22:24:50] <coldhead> does anyone have any easy problems?
[22:25:02] <coldhead> normal easy problems that don't involve creating new branches of computer science?
[22:28:57] <tw2113> problems that don't involve explaining $
[22:29:37] <coldhead> ideally, yes
[22:31:28] <Cork> lol
[22:35:51] <tw2113> because this is a jQuery help channel, not economics
[22:37:05] <coldhead> who was that guy
[23:12:22] * coldhead np: zu - the elusive character of victory
[23:24:02] <raj> is `this` always ev.currentTarget?
[23:24:59] <Cork> no
[23:25:14] <Cork> this is always the target of the event listener
[23:25:30] <coldhead> love alway yieldeth
[23:25:53] <raj> Cork, meaning `ev.target`?
[23:26:15] <Cork> raj: no, target is always the dom target of the event
[23:26:15] <nesoi> hey... so does anyone here know what I should try to prevent a tap event on a popup from also triggering an event on a textarea which lies below the popup's button? I tried estopImmediatePropagation();, e.stopPropagation(); and e.preventDefault();
[23:26:29] <Cork> raj: this is always the event listner targer; there is a difference
[23:26:40] <raj> Cork, can you give me an example?
[23:26:43] <Cork> raj: mainly in the context of bubbling events
[23:26:51] <nesoi> e.
[23:26:57] <raj> $('.someparent').on('click', '.somechild', function(ev) { })
[23:26:58] <coldhead> nesoi: i think you'd have more luck if you had a live demo to link to...
[23:27:06] <raj> what's what there?
[23:27:20] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'a', function(event) {}) <-- this is the a element
[23:27:24] <coldhead>  `this` will be .somechild
[23:27:25] <nesoi> coldhead : I can't. it's a phonegap app
[23:27:36] <coldhead> aw fudge
[23:27:52] <raj> ok
[23:28:03] <Cork> (clicking an a element inside the div) $(document).on('click', 'div', function(event) {}) <-- this is the div element, but event.target will be the a element
[23:28:06] <raj> Cork, and ev.target can be any child of .somechild or .somechild itself
[23:28:07] <raj> ?
[23:28:25] <raj> got it
[23:28:28] <Cork> raj: event.target will always be to actually clicked element
[23:28:28] <nesoi> so besides stopImmediatePropagation, stopPropagation and preventDefault, what else can I try?
[23:28:29] <raj> and currenttarget is document
[23:28:42] <raj> i understand
[23:28:46] <nesoi> it must have something to do with where in the DOM the event is triggered?
[23:28:48] <raj> thank you very much :)
[23:33:01] <nesoi> so besides stopImmediatePropagation, stopPropagation and preventDefault, what else can I try? No one has a hint?
[23:33:22] <Cork> nesoi: those are all the event relates functions
[23:33:32] <Cork> nesoi: what's the problem?
[23:34:20] <nesoi> cork: the problem is, I have a popup, and if I tap a button in the popup, and if there is a textarea under the button, the textarea gets an event too: it gets selected and the keyboard pops up.
[23:34:26] <nesoi> I would like that not to happen :)
[23:34:51] <Cork> nesoi: mobile?
[23:34:51] <nesoi> in other words, the popup covers a textarea and the button tapped is right over the textarea
[23:35:05] <nesoi> so the button gets tapped, the popup dismisses, but the tap is also received by the textarea
[23:35:13] <nesoi> yes, mobile but it shouldn't matter I think
[23:35:23] <Cork> they have the input overlays
[23:35:29] <nesoi> ?
[23:35:36] <Cork> and it is positioned out of z-index order
[23:35:48] <Cork> and it can capture events not meant for them from time to time
[23:36:02] <nesoi> right, so how to fix it?
[23:36:23] <Cork> you're using jquery ui dialog; or what do you mean by popup?
[23:36:34] <nesoi> simpledialog2 which is a jquery plugin
[23:36:53] <Cork> ok, try increasing the z-index of the outer element of the popup
[23:36:58] <Cork> that might help
[23:37:06] <nesoi> how do I do that cork?
[23:37:13] <Cork> uh... css?
[23:37:31] <Cork> .element-class { z-index: a hight value; }
[23:37:54] <nesoi> wait it's a parameter for this plugin
[23:37:57] <raj> setters need to be iterated or getters?
[23:38:07] <Cork> other things to try is overflow
[23:38:15] <nesoi> overflow?
[23:38:28] <Cork> uh, you know css right?
[23:38:38] <nesoi> a bit
[23:38:47] <Cork> its a property in css
[23:39:02] <Cork> raj: i don't really follow what the question is
[23:39:06] <nesoi> what does it do?
[23:39:32] <Cork> `g mdn overflow @ nesoi

[23:39:51] * Cork kicks b-ot
[23:40:08] <coldhead> lol
[23:40:11] <raj> Cork, there was something about getting info from a selector that selects mutliple items needing to be itereated
[23:40:18] <raj> or perhaps it was setting
[23:40:22] <raj> like adding a class
[23:40:44] <Cork> raj: no, setting normally doesn't need itterating
[23:41:02] <Cork> there are a few exceptions but normally its reading that needs each
[23:41:30] <Cork> (and i would reserve the term getter and setter for real getters and setters)
[23:42:48] <raj> Cork, why aren't those getters/setters?

[23:43:15] <raj> Cork, what's an example of a getter?
[23:43:22] <raj> besides hasClass()
[23:43:24] <Cork> see the last link
[23:43:29] <raj> k
[23:45:17] <Cork> ?eval var a = { b: 10 }; a.__defineGetter('b', function() { return 'NOOO!'; }); a.b

[23:45:26] <bot-t> Cork: "NOOO!"
[23:45:33] <Cork> raj: THAT is a getter :)

[23:46:42] <Cork> bah
[23:47:13] * Cork misses the bots from ##javascript ...
[23:49:53] <raj> Cork, i'm sure they'll share their code
[23:50:02] <Andrew_R> don't use getters and setters in js though, it's not supported in IE<9 and most people don't know what they are
[23:50:34] <Cork> Andrew_R: well depends, you can sniff for the support and user getters/setters with a compatibility solution
[23:50:48] <Cork> but ya, on the public net its not ready yet
[23:52:22] <Andrew_R> is there any advantage to using getters and setters(assuming the browser supports it) vs doing something more common, like accepting either 0 parameters for a "getter" or 1 parameters for a "setter", like what jquery does?
[23:52:41] <Cork> yes
[23:52:59] <Cork> you can make a value on an object "filtered"
[23:53:10] <Cork> without the outer party knowing its not just a straight value
[23:53:50] <coldhead> separate setters and getters makes the code simpler (they don't need to check if they're supposed to be getting or setting) but it adds to the cognitive load for the programmer who has to remember pairs of functions
[23:54:16] <Cork> Andrew_R: ex: navigator.__defineGetter__('userAgent', function() { return 'something predefined'; });
[23:54:41] <Cork> and navigator.userAgent === 'something predefined';
[23:54:57] <nesoi> zindex didn't stop the textarea from getting selected
[23:55:11] <nesoi> cork: if the tap is on the popup over a button, the button is not tapped
[23:55:21] <nesoi> but over the textarea the textarea is selected
[23:55:30] <Cork> nesoi: ya, cause buttons doesn't have the input overlay
[23:55:36] <Cork> only input and textareas does
[23:56:22] <nesoi> so what do I do to stop the textarea from being selected?
[23:56:56] <Andrew_R> yeah, I can see a how there would be a small performance improvement using a getter/setter property vs a method that does something like if(param1) { return _param1; } else { _param1 = param; } -- besides the fact that there are no private members in JS.
[23:57:02] <Cork> nesoi: can't give a generic answer; as it normally involves hackery
[23:57:16] <nesoi> :)
[23:57:24] <nesoi> any hints though?
[23:57:27] <Cork> Andrew_R: no, performance isn't the point
[23:57:39] <Cork> nesoi: i've given you the generic hints i can give you
[23:57:49] <Cork> without fiddling with the code i can't give you more
[23:57:58] <nesoi> what code could stop that from happening though?
[23:58:00] <Cork> except i have been there and banged on the probelm
[23:58:02] <Cork> *problem
[23:58:23] <nesoi> the only generic hint I haven't tried is something about overflow
[23:58:31] <Cork> nesoi: css rules can normally fix it
[23:58:56] <nesoi> btw Cork, do you have any idea why tapping on a button to trigger a popup is much much slower than tapping on a listview to trigger a popup?
[23:59:03] <Cork> Andrew_R: the only real point is that you can redefined values as functions
[23:59:03] <nesoi> or how I can speed it up?
[23:59:41] <Cork> nesoi: are you using touchstart in both cases?
