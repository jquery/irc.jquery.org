[00:30:00] <SoulRaven> anyone knows how to make 2 autocomplete fields on the same page?
[00:32:17] <aaronmcadam> mornin lads
[00:32:44] <SoulRaven> i have 2 autocomplete fields on the same page, both fields make the same thing, each field has a diferent class name, but i don't know how to make independent, to have the posibilty to select diferent on each field
[00:34:17] <yoann_> possibility to select different what?
[00:36:07] <SoulRaven> i have 2 textboxes in the same page, and 2 dropdown box, when i select something on the first dropodown box that is asociated to the first textbox, the autocomplete to work for the first set of dropdown and text
[00:36:44] <SoulRaven> and when i select the second dropdown asociated in the secound textbox, the autocomplete to work for the second dropdown and text
[00:37:25] <SoulRaven> now i make the autocomplet only for the first set, for the secound set i don't know how
[00:39:29] <yoann_> what do you target with you $(your_dom_element).autocomplete(); ???
[00:39:44] <SoulRaven> the textbox
[00:39:52] <aaronmcadam> is the data source ok?
[00:40:00] <SoulRaven> http://jsfiddle.net/bcBxw/
[00:40:07] <SoulRaven> this is the function
[00:40:11] <sasori> can you guys recommend any modal that has no browser incompatibility issues ?
[00:40:26] <SoulRaven> the city_del and county_del i have added to the cod just now
[00:40:43] <SoulRaven> aaronmcadam: yes, the data sorce is ok
[00:42:37] <yoann_> have tried to separate both autocomplete declaration?
[00:43:59] <SoulRaven> yes, and is working, but if i separate the declaration, on diferent function, i will have code duplicate
[00:46:07] <luke_66> anybody could help me?
[00:47:26] <aaronmcadam> refactor it then
[00:47:35] <aaronmcadam> define a function and pass it in
[00:50:28] <rchavik> using jquerytools, trying to call overlay() on dynamically created element. is there ways to do it like 'live()' ?
[00:50:46] <aaronmcadam> argggh
[00:50:57] <aaronmcadam> jquerytools.destroy()
[00:51:55] <rchavik> aaronmcadam, and replace with ?
[00:52:07] <aaronmcadam> something with a unified API
[00:52:20] <aaronmcadam> jq tools is really badly designed
[00:52:33] <aaronmcadam> or well, does things differently than other plugins
[00:52:40] <aaronmcadam> it's horrible
[00:52:53] <rchavik> yes, perhaps, but it's lightweight for my needs now
[00:53:35] <aaronmcadam> fuck lightweight when you can't interoperate
[00:54:04] <aaronmcadam> what's wrong with fancybox or jq ui?
[00:54:19] <phoe6> I have a bunch of .js files each defining something like iffe (module pattern).
[00:54:31] <aaronmcadam> it does *look* alright design-wise but it's shit code
[00:54:32] <phoe6> I am trying find how all of them are made available to the app?
[00:54:42] <phoe6> Will there be any onLoad call somewhere
[00:54:44] <phoe6> ?
[00:55:04] <rchavik> aaronmcadam,  i'm already using the jquerytools tabs, my widget requirement is limited now.
[00:55:12] <aaronmcadam> you can initialise them in a self executing function
[00:55:52] <rchavik> ah, found stackoverflow answer
[00:56:56] <aaronmcadam> phoe6 gimme a sec I'll fiddle you an example of how I'm doing it
[00:57:31] <phoe6> sure, thanks.
[00:59:21] <aaronmcadam> phoe6: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/mL263/
[00:59:56] <Mateo_> Hi everyone !
[00:59:58] <aaronmcadam> I've namespaced my modules
[01:00:52] <phoe6> aaronmcadam: thanks got it.
[01:01:02] <aaronmcadam> understand it ok yeah
[01:01:04] <phoe6> btw, where would you be calling app.views.signInForm?
[01:01:14] <phoe6> I got the namespaced aspect of it.
[01:01:20] <aaronmcadam> in my views
[01:01:32] <phoe6> I see.
[01:01:40] <aaronmcadam> actually no
[01:02:18] <phoe6> Actually, I am trying to understand ' where would be first entry point for the js/jquery libraries' for the browser
[01:02:21] <aaronmcadam> I don't call app specifically unless I need to add another view after app is initialised
[01:02:50] <phoe6> For e.g. in Fiddler it says onDomReady and onLoad
[01:02:51] <aaronmcadam> so that everything is under app in the global namespace
[01:03:03] <aaronmcadam> ah just use Domread
[01:03:29] <phoe6> Okay, and have it all in the global namespace and invoke it as and when required?
[01:03:43] <aaronmcadam> no need
[01:03:55] <aaronmcadam> you define what you want in the private App var
[01:04:05] <aaronmcadam> see return App
[01:04:43] <phoe6> Are all apps in the world (just to give a definition of universe), have their modules available from the entry point of either onLoad or onDomReady?
[01:04:43] <aaronmcadam> if you've got other external code, refer to the app var
[01:05:10] <aaronmcadam> just use ready
[01:05:36] <aaronmcadam> best to
[01:05:48] <aaronmcadam> otherwise the modules your calling might depend on dom elements being there etc
[01:06:03] <phoe6> I see.
[01:07:04] <aaronmcadam> it's nice having it all wrapped in one variable
[01:07:14] <phoe6> hmm
[01:07:23] <aaronmcadam> my other global is HIVEJS for utility functions and stuff
[01:08:24] <aaronmcadam> so in effect, App knows nothing really about what it's initialising, it's just setting the modules and nothing else
[01:08:25] <phoe6> got it.
[01:08:35] <aaronmcadam> decoupled
[01:08:35] <phoe6> okay.
[01:09:38] <phoe6> I am getting the idea of what's happening, but i think i really need to write something like that to understand deeper..
[01:09:47] <aaronmcadam> yep
[01:09:59] <aaronmcadam> you need a non-trivial project really
[01:10:20] <aaronmcadam> justto reiterate, I don't call app at all
[01:10:26] <aaronmcadam> unless I need to add to it
[01:10:33] <aaronmcadam> like this
[01:11:03] <aaronmcadam> app.views.compTakeupView = new HIVEJS.backbone.views.compTakeupView({
[01:11:03] <aaronmcadam>     el : $( '#competition' ),
[01:11:03] <aaronmcadam>     model : new HIVEJS.backbone.models.competition()
[01:11:03] <aaronmcadam> })
[01:11:13] <aaronmcadam> see?
[01:11:35] <aaronmcadam> but that's mainly to do how backbone works
[01:11:53] <phoe6> thanks aaronmcadam.
[01:11:56] <aaronmcadam> no probs
[01:12:07] <aaronmcadam> does take a little while to figure out how things work
[01:12:13] <phoe6> How is jquery knowing of all the apps (which you have defined)?
[01:12:16] <aaronmcadam> but once you do it's so much tidier
[01:12:30] <aaronmcadam> the backbone views?
[01:13:12] <phoe6> So when we say views, it like MVC style thing ( in my case I would go and look for python code because it is pylons app
[01:13:13] <aaronmcadam> i think backbone handles the initialisation when you define them
[01:13:17] <aaronmcadam> yes
[01:13:21] <phoe6> or did you mean something else.
[01:13:30] <aaronmcadam> no ur right
[01:13:38] <aaronmcadam> cool
[01:13:50] <aaronmcadam> you want to try and mirror your set up on the server side
[01:13:59] <aaronmcadam> you might want to look at backbone
[01:14:11] <phoe6> okay got it. I was totally looking within all the js files which have defines these Apps and then wondering where is the first entry point! :)
[01:14:24] <aaronmcadam> sorry i meant on the client, if you can model your app like your python
[01:14:35] <phoe6> yeah.
[01:14:42] <aaronmcadam> cool
[01:14:59] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[01:15:17] <phoe6> thanks for the explaination, aaronmcadam. It gets me going further. :)
[01:15:24] <aaronmcadam> if you want to keep it consistently mvc, try backbone
[01:15:30] <aaronmcadam> no prob at all phoe6
[01:15:58] <phoe6> is 'backbone' is specific terminology?
[01:16:02] <aaronmcadam> phoe6: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/scriptjunkie/hh377172.aspx
[01:16:10] <aaronmcadam> oh no it's a library
[01:16:16] <aaronmcadam> http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/
[01:16:20] <phoe6> yeah, just googled it.
[01:16:33] <aaronmcadam> have a look at that tutorial on script junkie
[01:17:06] <aaronmcadam> don't worry about the jq mobile stuff, the concepts are the same
[01:17:10] <coldhead> listen to this dude, phoe6, he knows what he's talking about!
[01:17:24] <aaronmcadam> haha
[01:17:39] <aaronmcadam> I'm still learning about the best patterns
[01:18:01] <aaronmcadam> revealing module is the one I use all the time now but interested in decorators, etc
[01:21:02] <aaronmcadam> what you workin on coldhead
[01:21:35] <coldhead> something to measure twitter influence and engagement, apparently
[01:21:41] <aaronmcadam> nice
[01:21:46] <coldhead> AKA locking up the browser
[01:21:50] <aaronmcadam> haha
[01:21:55] <aaronmcadam> web workers needed
[01:22:17] <coldhead> very much so
[01:22:25] <coldhead> what are you working on, aaronmcadam?
[01:22:35] <aaronmcadam> jqm site
[01:23:20] <aaronmcadam> jquery mobile
[01:25:44] <coldhead> look forward to me fwding all jQM questions in #jQuery to you then, monsieur expert :P
[01:26:20] <austen> So... Just converted my app to use em instead of % or px. Works... except in IE. IE doesn't even display the css properly... (SHOCKER)
[01:26:27] <aaronmcadam> hha i'm no expert
[01:26:40] <aaronmcadam> I'd really like to set up a code review site
[01:26:48] <aaronmcadam> with github integration
[01:27:22] <austen> Also, resizing based on em seems to be very browser intensive... Resizing by px or % is way faster...
[01:27:27] <aaronmcadam> it's hard to get intermediate to advanced help
[01:28:41] <aaronmcadam> coldhead: your the one who laughed when I called adam by his first name lol
[01:29:55] <coldhead> i sure did

[01:54:19] <aaronmcadam> ah kk
[01:54:21] <aaronmcadam> cheers
[01:54:22] <gf3> aaronmcadam: there's this: https://github.com/gf3/Jerk
[01:54:34] <gf3> aaronmcadam: e.g.: https://github.com/gf3/protobot
[01:55:03] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[01:55:04] <aaronmcadam> cheers dude interestin
[01:55:31] <aaronmcadam> u know which is better?
[01:55:41] <aaronmcadam> I'm very used to bot-t tho :(
[01:55:44] <gf3> aaronmcadam: protobot uses Jerk
[01:56:12] <aaronmcadam> packaged dependency?
[01:56:12] <aaronmcadam> or install separate
[01:56:26] <gf3> packaged
[01:56:38] <aaronmcadam> aren't we going to have something like rubygems.org or whatever
[01:56:41] <aaronmcadam> rubycutter?
[01:56:55] <gf3> for node there is npm
[01:57:00] <aaronmcadam> so you could just run npm without grabbing the repo
[01:57:24] <gf3> jerk is on npm, because it is a library
[01:57:27] <gf3> protobot is not
[01:57:31] <aaronmcadam> ah
[01:58:16] <aaronmcadam> groupie?
[01:58:25] <aaronmcadam> you know what that is?
[01:58:49] <gf3> it's chaining library
[01:58:55] <gf3> let's you chain async functions together
[01:59:09] <aaronmcadam> oh nice
[01:59:19] <aaronmcadam> I'm going to a node workshop in november
[01:59:34] <aaronmcadam> haven't really played with it much but need it for messaging in real time

[02:11:50] <kontain> When I click on the tags in an inner project page the tags loads thumbnails at the bottom of the phone.
[02:12:03] <kontain> It does not clears up the current content.
[02:12:16] <kontain> Can anyone help me out here?
[02:13:04] <ignaciogiri> aaronmcadam: also in the code I explain the problem pretty easy
[02:15:37] <kontain> ignaciogiri: can ya help me?
[02:16:06] <aaronmcadam> sorry I gotta get some work done
[02:16:06] <ignaciogiri> give me a moment, I'm trying to solve my stuff first :)
[02:17:06] <trickz> hey, how would you send an array in $.post ? i tried arr.serialize() but theres an error saying object has no serialize method
[02:18:11] <boghog> is there a way to make the fadeIn/fadeOut look nicer in IE 8/9? I'm using them to transition from one element to another but it looks.. weird in IE, the transition isn't smooth and text looks a bit odd too while the fade is happening
[02:20:55] <rubknob> i'm using e.preventDefault(); to disable the enter key.  Instead of completely disabling the enter key, is there a way I can allow the use of the enter key but not allow it for form submission?
[02:21:15] <seutje> any way I can save an operator in a var for later use?
[02:21:37] <seutje> without just making a map of all operators and matching them with a string or something
[02:22:20] <aaronmcadam> trickz: can't do that
[02:22:30] <aaronmcadam> $( arr ).serializeArray()
[02:22:55] <seutje> wait, I can't even use a map, can I? q.q
[02:24:10] <aaronmcadam> an operator?
[02:24:47] <aaronmcadam> rubknob: you could check for that key being entered
[02:24:58] <aaronmcadam> or pressed
[02:25:25] <aro> canyou removeClass on a wildcard?
[02:25:48] <aaronmcadam> what?
[02:26:02] <aaronmcadam> don't tell me you're using $('*')
[02:26:13] <aro> like $('selector').removeClass( "extended-*" );
[02:26:17] <aro> just wondering
[02:26:19] <kontain> ignaciogiri: got it?
[02:26:40] <ignaciogiri> kontain: no
[02:26:54] <seutje> yea, I want ppl to be able to pass which operator should be used for the comparison to this plugin
[02:27:25] <seutje> so they can decide if they want a floor or a ceiling
[02:28:15] <aaronmcadam> ah gotcha
[02:28:22] <aaronmcadam> so then?
[02:28:32] <aaronmcadam> fiddle me
[02:28:40] <kontain> is there somthing called 'addID'
[02:29:10] <aaronmcadam> aro that's not how u do it
[02:29:24] <aaronmcadam> that won't work
[02:29:36] <aro> well is there a way to do it?
[02:29:40] <aaronmcadam> one sec
[02:29:42] <aaronmcadam> yes
[02:29:46] <aro> ok
[02:30:02] <aaronmcadam> https://gist.github.com/1053597
[02:30:19] <aro> cool tks
[02:30:25] <aaronmcadam> so you'd replace rating- with extended
[02:30:30] <aaronmcadam> and then a pattern
[02:30:48] <aaronmcadam> reg ex tho so you'll have to work it out
[02:31:01] <aaronmcadam> oh wait
[02:31:12] <aaronmcadam> hang on aro there's an error in that gist
[02:31:14] <seutje> u just have to match the first bit, no?
[02:31:21] <aaronmcadam> can't use class as a var name
[02:31:31] <seutje> oh right lol
[02:32:02] <aaronmcadam> aro: https://gist.github.com/1053597
[02:32:25] <aaronmcadam> it wouldn't match if you were only looking for the prefix
[02:33:02] <aro> ok cool
[02:33:14] <kontain> can anyone help me out here?
[02:33:35] <rubknob> how do I target textareas?
[02:34:05] <aro> $('textarea')
[02:34:11] <rubknob> thanks
[02:34:15] <aaronmcadam> haha

[02:35:13] <sasori> question: what could be the possible cause why the jquery modal confirm dialog doesn't appear if the buttons are set ?..if they are not commented, the modal doesn't show up
[02:36:28] <aaronmcadam> christ
[02:36:40] <aaronmcadam> that's never goin to work seutje
[02:36:50] <seutje> yea, starting to fear the same
[02:36:54] <aaronmcadam> you're going to have to pass literal strings
[02:37:06] <aaronmcadam> as in 'lessThan'
[02:37:15] <aaronmcadam> or else just saying
[02:37:30] <aaronmcadam> switch ( operator ) { case '>' : bla bla
[02:37:34] <seutje> gonna be a messy switch mess
[02:37:37] <aaronmcadam> yup
[02:37:44] <theCode> is there a way to programatically select text using jq?
[02:37:49] <derknecht> i try to delegate a drag event on a canvas to a new created img object. the img should than act like a droppable, and should follow the mouse. Here is a code snipped: http://nopaste.info/3388a7b804.html  can someone give me a hint how to reach this?
[02:37:50] <aaronmcadam> it's impossible what you're trying
[02:37:59] <seutje> but I want flexibilities :(
[02:38:01] <aaronmcadam> there's no .toOperator() function
[02:38:06] <seutje> lame :P
[02:38:08] <aaronmcadam> there's no way to cast it to an operator
[02:38:13] <aaronmcadam> not sure any language has that
[02:38:18] <seutje> and no way to store just an operator
[02:38:29] <aaronmcadam> u know of any language that lets you?
[02:38:36] <seutje> not rly
[02:38:46] <aaronmcadam> doesn't make sense to store a language construct in a variable
[02:38:52] <seutje> but I only know 1 or 2 languages, at best
[02:39:04] <aaronmcadam> why don't you use a comparator function like everyone else
[02:39:09] <aaronmcadam> 1, 0, -1
[02:39:14] <aaronmcadam> people are used to those
[02:39:17] <seutje> hmm yea
[02:39:23] <aaronmcadam> common pattern
[02:39:34] <seutje> now why didn't I think of that?
[02:39:37] <seutje> senks!
[02:39:45] <seutje> aaronmcadam++
[02:39:58] <aaronmcadam> you just got an idea in your head and ran with it without the ball ;)
[02:40:01] <aaronmcadam> easily done!
[02:41:20] <trickz> noob question, but i cant do this -> http://jsfiddle.net/LJJHp/ ? (assigning value to object)
[02:41:48] <aaronmcadam> you need a 2 dimensional array?
[02:42:02] <aaronmcadam> i'll amend your fiddle to a more js way
[02:42:04] <trickz> kinda, yeh assinging values directly
[02:42:11] <trickz> thanks
[02:42:22] <seutje> u need to init obj['a'] first, but u could just do it in 1 go in the assignment
[02:42:46] <aaronmcadam> trickz: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/LJJHp/3/
[02:43:14] <aaronmcadam> trickz: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/LJJHp/5/
[02:43:29] <aaronmcadam> use object literals where ever possible
[02:45:09] <qwerty57> .js files don't share each others functions, right?
[02:46:36] <qwerty57> i mean i include functions.js then setIDs.js.nvm
[02:46:37] <qwerty57> nvm
[02:46:41] <qwerty57> nnnnnnnnnnnnvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[02:46:43] <qwerty57> :)
[02:46:53] <derknecht> i try to delegate a drag event. can someone give me a hint how? here is what i tried: http://nopaste.info/3388a7b804.html  Thanks a lot
[02:46:55] <kontain> $('#entry').removeClass();
[02:46:59] <kontain> That removes the class entry?
[02:47:08] <hrwath> no
[02:47:32] <hrwath> ?removeClass @ kontain
[02:47:32] <bot-t> kontain, .removeClass([className]): Remove a single class, multiple classes, or all classes from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/
[02:48:28] <aaronmcadam> aro: did u get it ok
[02:49:29] <aro> i think so
[02:49:57] <aaronmcadam> cool
[02:52:59] <Onyx47> hey guys, I'm trying to do something like this: http://pastebin.com/gkXEN5tz to send JSON data over to PHP in the backend but 'name' doesn't get parsed as a variable and resulting JSON looks something like[{"name":"3"},{"name":"10"}, ... ] instead of using the proper name. Any ways around this?
[02:53:06] <derknecht> is there no way to delegate a drag event to another element? minimal example: http://nopaste.info/3388a7b804.html   plz help, or tell me if this is a total noob question.
[02:54:15] <riah> Hi all!
[02:54:33] <Hellojere> I'm firing a function on window scroll, but would like to set a minimum interval for it to hit hit. Is setTimeout hack the only way to do it?
[02:55:01] <riah> Could somebody take a look at https://gist.github.com/1136482 ? I don't understand why the second .get() is not working?
[02:56:40] <aaronmcadam> whois bot
[02:56:44] <aaronmcadam> whois bot-t
[02:57:07] <seutje> what was that html5 beer coaster app again?
[02:57:17] <aaronmcadam> hiya temp01
[02:57:47] <aaronmcadam> temp01, is it possible to use bot-t on another channel like http://inamidst.com/phenny/?
[02:58:23] <seutje> aaronmcadam: he already is on multiple channels
[02:58:43] <aaronmcadam> I want to run it on a private channel
[02:58:53] <riah> in general, is it not possible to use a nested .get()?
[02:59:19] <xec> riah: are you sure the "started" var is a string containing "true"?
[03:00:54] <aaronmcadam> riah
[03:01:01] <aaronmcadam> don't use string literals for booleans please
[03:01:18] <aaronmcadam> then you can just do if ( started )
[03:01:28] <aaronmcadam> makes it very confusing
[03:01:38] <aaronmcadam> ?eval "false"
[03:01:40] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: "false"
[03:01:45] <aaronmcadam> ?eval "true"
[03:01:46] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: "true"
[03:01:57] <aaronmcadam> hang on that's wrong
[03:02:00] <aaronmcadam> ohh wait
[03:02:05] <aaronmcadam> ?eval !!"true"
[03:02:06] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: true
[03:02:10] <aaronmcadam> ?eval !!"false"
[03:02:11] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: true
[03:02:11] <riah> xec: yes. i've tested that part on its own.
[03:02:13] <aaronmcadam> see
[03:02:31] <aaronmcadam> it's confusing for devs all strings evaluate to true
[03:02:35] <riah> aaronmcadam: how can i return a boolean through an html response then?
[03:02:46] <aaronmcadam> json
[03:02:57] <riah> hmm okay
[03:03:03] <riah> i can still make it "proper" when it works
[03:03:34] <aaronmcadam> best to do it as you're programming
[03:03:42] <aaronmcadam> most times you never get time to "make it proper"
[03:03:47] <aaronmcadam> later
[03:04:46] <riah> right now i'm not even sure if this is what i want ... spending the time to figure out how to put out json would be pointless if this turns out not to be the code that'll keep
[03:04:50] <riah> christ
[03:05:03] <riah> why is it that whenever you ask people for help they try to impose their view of the world upon you
[03:05:04] <aaronmcadam> well stop
[03:05:07] <aaronmcadam> and think about it
[03:05:22] <aaronmcadam> just trying to make u a better dev
[03:05:27] <aaronmcadam> and teach you something
[03:05:31] <aaronmcadam> that's what this place is for
[03:05:39] <riah> yeah i should be grateful about that, sorry
[03:05:44] <aaronmcadam> too right
[03:05:45] <aaronmcadam> :p
[03:05:49] <aaronmcadam> no prob
[03:06:15] <riah> and i do see your point about the json, but i also know myself a little and that i do make things proper once i've figured out they are what i want
[03:06:39] <aaronmcadam> cool
[03:06:53] <riah> and i've also learned that programming is oftentimes a bit like a puzzle - you can't put all the pieces together at the same time, it's just too much. little by little works better, in general
[03:07:12] <aaronmcadam> I'm just speakin from experience, parts of the app I'm on pass around string booleans as if devs didn't know about JSON booleans
[03:07:28] <aaronmcadam> I tend to refactor as I go
[03:07:29] <riah> oh so i hit a sore spot there? :)
[03:07:36] <aaronmcadam> takes a bit longer but worth it
[03:07:42] <aaronmcadam> a little bit
[03:07:46] <riah> yeah that overloads my brain - i need to work in iterations
[03:07:55] <aaronmcadam> you should also be using treble equals for comparison of strings
[03:08:00] <aaronmcadam> if you must
[03:08:03] <riah> treble?
[03:08:06] <aaronmcadam> ===
[03:08:10] <riah> oh triple, alright
[03:08:11] <aaronmcadam> absolutely equals
[03:08:33] <aaronmcadam> because
[03:08:35] <aaronmcadam> look
[03:08:44] <aaronmcadam> ?eval true == 'true'
[03:08:45] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: false
[03:08:53] <riah> oh cool bot
[03:09:02] <aaronmcadam> see
[03:09:15] <riah> in my case this is actually what i want, one could argue
[03:09:20] <aaronmcadam> can confuse you if you're glancing over stuff
[03:09:26] <riah> but anyway, right now that piece of the code works
[03:09:31] <aaronmcadam> ah yeah just saying it can catch u out
[03:09:36] <riah> as soon as i put a second .get() there it stops
[03:09:39] <Onyx47> I find it interesting how it's easier to work with JSON in PHP than in JS which it should be native to :P
[03:09:51] <aaronmcadam> you're nesting ajax requests
[03:09:55] <riah> yeah it's like back with C you were supposed to do 0 == foobar instead of foobar == 0
[03:10:01] <aaronmcadam> that's one step on the way to inception
[03:10:08] <riah> heheheh
[03:10:10] <riah> good movie!
[03:10:20] <aaronmcadam> meh
[03:10:30] <riah> okay so i take it that's not leagal
[03:10:31] <riah> legal*
[03:10:34] <aaronmcadam> not the best idea to chain ajax commands
[03:10:43] <aaronmcadam> well nest them i mean
[03:10:46] <riah> yeah
[03:10:52] <aaronmcadam> need a different pattern
[03:10:59] <riah> so how would you do it?
[03:11:04] <aaronmcadam> why can't you pass both to runs
[03:11:11] <riah> hum
[03:11:14] <aaronmcadam> and do the testing in your serverside code
[03:11:17] <riah> that's not a bad idea
[03:11:44] <riah> you mean i just ask it for the url and if i get back nothing, then too bad, nothing happens
[03:11:47] <riah> i like that
[03:12:02] <aaronmcadam> well just pass back what you want
[03:12:40] <aaronmcadam> have a sort of controller in that runs script
[03:12:53] <aaronmcadam> isStarted, etc etc
[03:13:18] <aaronmcadam> firstExercise
[03:13:33] <aaronmcadam> if !isStarted, return false
[03:13:43] <aaronmcadam> something similar
[03:13:59] <aaronmcadam> you get the idea
[03:14:10] <aaronmcadam> all you want there is to return a url correct?
[03:14:17] <riah> yeah
[03:14:23] <aaronmcadam> so let your server side lang control what the url should be
[03:14:25] <riah> i'm doing far too much client-side
[03:14:28] <aaronmcadam> yip
[03:14:30] <aaronmcadam> easily done
[03:14:38] <aaronmcadam> people love jquery too much ahah
[03:14:48] <riah> it *is* cool
[03:14:57] <riah> but it can't compete with my beloved ruby tho
[03:15:00] <aaronmcadam> it is at the start
[03:15:08] <riah> i
[03:15:09] <aaronmcadam> then you realise how it fits in with your stack
[03:15:27] <riah> right now i'm training my collegue to use jQuery instead of doing it the old-fashioned way
[03:15:27] <aaronmcadam> i'm on django
[03:15:48] <riah> whenever he puts stuff like "body onload='javascript:..." somewhere he gets a slap on the backhead
[03:15:58] <riah> quite a fast way to train somebody :)
[03:16:03] <aaronmcadam> ahhhh
[03:16:20] <aaronmcadam> there's some really awful jquery out  there too
[03:16:42] <aaronmcadam> luckily there's a javascript plugin for it tho phew :)
[03:17:20] <Onyx47> there's not a language and/or library that can't be bastardised
[03:17:26] <aaronmcadam> hmm nobody bite
[03:17:31] <aaronmcadam> :(
[03:17:32] <riah> well we should probably remind ourselves what we're doing there isn't easy. there's a lot to learn and a lot to keep on top of - i can still remember when i began to learn programming when i was 12 or so, i had immense problems understanding the way the syntax worked at first
[03:18:01] <aaronmcadam> i wouldn't say it's very hard
[03:18:07] <riah> but it is
[03:18:08] <aaronmcadam> just people tend to give up
[03:18:18] <aaronmcadam> or learn the bare minimum
[03:18:24] <riah> the stuff you're doing, puts you in a VERY small percentage of people on earth
[03:18:40] <aaronmcadam> and then come in here whinging when experienced people try to tell them how to do things properly
[03:18:49] <aaronmcadam> not aimed at you riah
[03:19:03] <aaronmcadam> had a lot more ignorant people come in here
[03:19:05] <riah> "not giving up", "reading the docs", "doing the right thing" - all that takes judgement, determination and a clear mind
[03:19:15] <riah> i've been through depressions and months of burnout
[03:19:20] <aaronmcadam> shite
[03:19:24] <riah> and nothing of that is as given as we think it to be
[03:19:36] <nir01> how do i print?
[03:19:41] <riah> not taken personally, aaronmcadam :)
[03:19:44] <aaronmcadam> I find trouble getting help or finding stuff on more advanced things so it's all relative
[03:19:46] <riah> nir01: with a printer :)
[03:20:13] <nir01> riah: is there a jquery function that simulates ctrl+p?
[03:20:17] <aaronmcadam> riah there's loads of people who are like "wtf? I'll pay you just do my f**kin work for me"
[03:20:25] <blackspotwiggins> nir01, there is an experimental js plugin
[03:20:33] <blackspotwiggins> window.print()
[03:20:36] <aaronmcadam> surely that'd be platform specific?
[03:20:40] <riah> aaronmcadam: of course it is - i see myself as a rather small fish because i know there's people who actually built the languages i'm using and stuff, but of course to the people who use the software that i write, i'm practically a magician
[03:20:44] <aaronmcadam> didn't know that existed properly
[03:20:49] <aaronmcadam> is it in the spec blackspotwiggins ?
[03:20:59] <blackspotwiggins> ?mdc window.print

[03:21:26] <aaronmcadam> cool
[03:21:43] <arun___> thanx
[03:21:43] <riah> nir01: first google hit: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jQPrintIt
[03:21:57] <aaronmcadam> not part of the standard?
[03:22:12] <pngl> How can I get the value of a field but only if it is enabled/checked?
[03:22:18] <aaronmcadam> riah see ?g window.print ;)
[03:22:19] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Using window.print() to print a document - http://www.javascriptkit.com/howto/newtech2.shtml
[03:22:29] <aaronmcadam> you can search from in here
[03:22:59] <nir01> riah: There are no published releases for this project.
[03:23:14] <aaronmcadam> there's bound to be cross browser issues
[03:23:24] <aaronmcadam> cross platform implementations too
[03:23:33] <aaronmcadam> unless the browser can handle that
[03:23:38] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, ive never seen it not working
[03:23:40] <nir01> blackspotwiggins: so it should work only on mozilla?
[03:24:04] <aaronmcadam> why does it need a plugin then?
[03:24:08] <aaronmcadam> blackspotwiggins:
[03:24:09] <blackspotwiggins> it doesnt
[03:24:19] <aaronmcadam> so why has someone wrapped it, lol
[03:24:28] <blackspotwiggins> because people do retarded things
[03:24:31] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[03:24:38] <blackspotwiggins> and not part of spec != not implemented
[03:24:44] <aaronmcadam> oh yeah i know
[03:24:57] <aaronmcadam> I automatically thought cuz there was a plugin there must be edge cases
[03:25:00] <blackspotwiggins> nir01, i appreciate you not reading anything or not trying anything for yourself
[03:25:05] <aaronmcadam> specs come from implementations anyway
[03:25:09] <aaronmcadam> not the other way round
[03:25:20] <aaronmcadam> or else that's the way it should be
[03:26:27] <riah> nir01: sorry, didn't look closely enough - what aaronmcadam said should help you, though?
[03:26:34] <nir01> blackspotwiggins: sure, but all i could find is plugins. i don't like plugins, they become outdated, on the other side jquery itself is easy to update.
[03:27:03] <nir01> riah: i'm going to try that
[03:27:08] <riah> good luck!
[03:27:16] <blackspotwiggins> nir01, do you know that jquery is based on javascript?
[03:27:27] <nir01> blackspotwiggins: yes
[03:27:39] <blackspotwiggins> so why not search for pure js solution first
[03:27:41] <nir01> omg
[03:28:17] <nir01> blackspotwiggins: i prefer coffee, that uses jq, that uses js
[03:28:32] <aaronmcadam> no it doesn't
[03:28:40] <aaronmcadam> weeee
[03:28:44] <blackspotwiggins> failure to use google is inexcusable no matter what shitty compiled-to-js language you use
[03:28:57] <aaronmcadam> have you tried the JavaScript jQuery plugin
[03:29:05] <aaronmcadam> hahahaha blackspotwiggins
[03:29:07] <aaronmcadam> :D
[03:29:12] <nir01> :)
[03:29:40] <aaronmcadam> coffee is intersting tho
[03:29:42] <aaronmcadam> wehay!
[03:29:48] <aaronmcadam> ?say welcome back me!
[03:29:50] <bot-t> ...
[03:29:50] <nir01> i'm just a lazy rubist, blame me
[03:30:02] <aaronmcadam> do you know much about js itself?

[03:32:07] <aaronmcadam> ?
[03:38:06] <luke_66> hi everyone. how can i check if an event is a mouse click? i have a function   funct(e, data), i'm trying with: if (e.type == "click") but it doesnt work...
[03:38:40] <blackspotwiggins> luke_66, the easiest way would be to bind to mouse click.
[03:38:47] <nir01> window.print works in mozilla and firefox. doesn't work in chrome, didn't test in IE cause got no IE
[03:39:04] <blackspotwiggins> nir01, wfm in chrome
[03:39:20] <nir01> blackspotwiggins: sry?
[03:39:23] <luke_66> blackspotwiggins: how?
[03:39:44] <blackspotwiggins> nir01, Works For Me in chrome
[03:39:49] <blackspotwiggins> luke_66, srsly?
[03:39:55] <blackspotwiggins> bind("click") ?
[03:39:57] <Onyx47> luke_66: $('selector').bind('click', function(){...});
[03:40:01] <luke_66> :-) yes
[03:40:40] <nir01> blackspotwiggins: oh... no it works for me too... after refreshing the page)
[03:40:47] <dmarkey> Anyone use jqplot here?
[03:41:19] <dmarkey> im havinf problems with the legend getting too big for the box
[03:41:39] <luke_66> Onyx47: i'm alreay inside a jquery function (jstree): .bind("select_node.jstree", function (e, data)
[03:42:26] <obv> hi
[03:43:09] <obv> i try to sen a data with $.post() to a php file but i cant
[03:43:12] <Onyx47> luke_66: did you try using $(this) inside that function? $(this).bind...
[03:43:24] <blackspotwiggins> Onyx47, what good would that do?
[03:44:06] <luke_66> Onyx47: i'll try ;-)
[03:44:11] <obv> this is my code: $.post("data.php", function(data){ data = dt});
[03:44:20] <blackspotwiggins> luke_66, if you bind to select_node event, it will never be click
[03:44:21] <riah> aaronmcadam: well it's a bit of a custom thing in this case ... just a controller, no view. it's only there to keep the user waiting for something to happen and then to redirect. but it works like a charm now.
[03:44:28] <Onyx47> bah, you're right, custom event already
[03:44:50] <obv> and in the php file i do this $_post['data']
[03:44:55] <aaronmcadam> yeah was gonna say controller
[03:44:58] <obv> but its not work
[03:45:05] <aaronmcadam> cool dude
[03:45:10] <blackspotwiggins> obv, have you looked at $.post signature?
[03:45:16] <blackspotwiggins> that's not the correct syntax
[03:45:17] <blackspotwiggins> it cant work
[03:45:19] <riah> aaronmcadam: it's a sort of kiosk application ... not rly looking forward to crawling through chromium's sourcecode to disable all the shortcuts that could be used to do stuff we don't want the user to do...
[03:45:19] <aaronmcadam> should have been that way from the start riah :P well done
[03:45:39] <aaronmcadam> you should be able to run it chromeles
[03:45:49] <luke_66> blackspotwiggins: so how can i do that? with a plain js condition (e.type == "click") it doesnt work but i dont know why...
[03:45:49] <aaronmcadam> look at the flags
[03:45:59] <aaronmcadam> type about: into the location bar riah
[03:46:03] <blackspotwiggins> luke_66, i just told you.
[03:46:04] <riah> aaronmcadam: "chromium --kiosk"
[03:46:06] <aaronmcadam> and talk to paul_irish if he comes on
[03:46:06] <Onyx47> riah: it doesn't have kiosk mode built-in? o.O
[03:46:42] <aaronmcadam> ah you've already investigated then
[03:46:52] <riah> Onyx47: aaronmcadam: so yeah it does have kiosk mode - doesn't take care of stuff like ctrl-shift-u, ctrl-left, ctrl-right or alt-f4, ctrl-alt-del, etc. though - there's a whole thread about it somewhere on the chromium-development list
[03:47:04] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[03:47:10] <aaronmcadam> riah
[03:47:18] <riah> yeah aaronmcadam? :)
[03:47:23] <aaronmcadam> of course you could disable those in your js globally maybe
[03:47:33] <riah> aaronmcadam: alt-f4? i doubt it!
[03:47:37] <aaronmcadam> haha
[03:47:40] <aaronmcadam> alt tho
[03:47:43] <riah> yeah
[03:47:44] <aaronmcadam> and ctrl
[03:47:46] <riah> hmm
[03:47:51] <riah> that might do the job already
[03:47:54] <aaronmcadam> there is a shortcut plugin somewhere
[03:47:57] <riah> we'll have to try it out
[03:48:08] <sasori> question: how to make the jquery modal-confirm box, stay in place when the screen is scrolled up or down? because, when I submit a form, the modal pops out, but when i scroll up, it's left down
[03:48:11] <aaronmcadam> yeah you need to press at least ctrl or alt first right :D
[03:48:20] <aaronmcadam> just make sure you abstract that away
[03:48:33] <aaronmcadam> so it's not intertwined with your actual app code
[03:48:39] <riah> yeah
[03:48:47] <riah> that has a couple of weeks more time
[03:48:52] <aaronmcadam> ah u get me you're a dude
[03:48:56] <riah> first got to finish the actual app
[03:49:13] <aaronmcadam> yea cool
[03:49:19] <riah> also rails teaches you real good to keep concerns separated
[03:49:25] <aaronmcadam> good good
[03:49:27] <riah> tried django once, was already too deep in ruby
[03:49:28] <riah> hahahahh
[03:49:36] <aaronmcadam> pretty much the same
[03:49:42] <aaronmcadam> in ethos
[03:49:43] <riah> that sounds ambigious lol
[03:49:50] <aaronmcadam> turn of phrase
[03:49:53] <riah> yeah
[03:50:50] <luke_66> blackspotwiggins: i have to prevent to 'autoselect' the node marked as initially_select after jstree loading, and bind it only to user click
[03:50:50] <aaronmcadam> you're miles ahead of most newish guys in here then riah
[03:51:13] <aaronmcadam> i.e. got an idea of software engineering / structure/ etc
[03:51:37] <blackspotwiggins> luke_66, consult jstree docs for that?
[03:52:01] <aaronmcadam> lol
[03:52:09] <aaronmcadam> yeah that's all you're asking luke_66
[03:52:32] <aaronmcadam> "blackspot, you mind lookin up the docs for me on this plugin and pasting in the answer?"
[03:53:14] <blackspotwiggins> you want fries with that?
[03:53:54] <aaronmcadam> i do love how lots of people ask specific questions about specific plugins
[03:54:09] <Onyx47> ok, I give up, either I fail at googling or there's no way because only piece of code claiming to work I found throws a syntax error, guess it's time for " good ol' " strings -.-
[03:54:25] <aaronmcadam> along the lines of "do i have the right parameters for this function?"
[03:54:32] <riah> aaronmcadam: like i said, i've been working as a software dev for 10 years, got a burnout then, decided to study at university and never have to do anything with computers again - first professor i meet, asks me if i know something about computers. that's the way life goes.
[03:54:40] <aaronmcadam> Onyx47: what's wrong with ye
[03:54:50] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[03:54:53] <aaronmcadam> good man
[03:55:11] <Onyx47> aaronmcadam: this small piece of code: http://pastebin.com/gkXEN5tz
[03:55:15] <riah> anywa
[03:55:17] <riah> got to run
[03:55:21] <riah> thanks for the help and nice convo again
[03:55:22] <aaronmcadam> good luck
[03:55:26] <aaronmcadam> no problem
[03:55:27] <riah> and you, take care!
[03:55:27] <Onyx47> JS won't parse 'name' as a variable
[03:55:43] <aaronmcadam> Onyx47: wtf are u doin
[03:55:45] <aaronmcadam> lol
[03:55:45] <blackspotwiggins> it doesnt work that way
[03:55:51] <blackspotwiggins> Onyx47, first
[03:55:53] <aaronmcadam> simples
[03:55:56] <blackspotwiggins> dont use new Array(), rather []
[03:56:00] <Onyx47> I know it doesn't, this is desparation move :P
[03:56:02] <aaronmcadam> you want
[03:56:05] <blackspotwiggins> second, you are doing classic map
[03:56:08] <blackspotwiggins> so use that
[03:56:21] <aaronmcadam> data[ name ] = $(this).val(0
[03:56:22] <blackspotwiggins> third, if you want object property names for vars
[03:56:26] <blackspotwiggins> you need to use [] syntax
[03:56:31] <blackspotwiggins> like aaronmcadam just pasted
[03:57:13] <aaronmcadam> damn
[03:57:17] <Onyx47> aaronmcadam: that's the first thing I did, unfortunately it's a dynamically built form with any possible amount of rows
[03:57:20] <aaronmcadam> and he was just about to give up
[03:57:46] <aaronmcadam> you shouldn't be doing it that way anyways
[03:57:54] <aaronmcadam> but that's beside the point i spose
[03:58:17] <blackspotwiggins> actually
[03:58:24] <blackspotwiggins> thoe whole thing should be using serialize
[03:58:30] <blackspotwiggins> or serializeArray
[03:58:36] <aaronmcadam> i didn't read enough of it to realise that
[03:58:37] <aaronmcadam> lol
[03:58:53] <aaronmcadam> but yeah
[03:59:02] <aaronmcadam> ?serializeArray @ Onyx47
[03:59:03] <bot-t> Onyx47, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[04:00:10] <blackspotwiggins> altho its nice that you tried to research this before asking right away
[04:00:36] <aaronmcadam> true
[04:00:44] <aaronmcadam> instead of being arsey
[04:00:47] <Onyx47> oh, damn, you're right there... well, still doesn't fix the original problem... any suggestions on how to handle dynamically added rows then?
[04:01:12] <aaronmcadam> you'd need to delegate the form
[04:01:14] <aaronmcadam> submit
[04:01:30] <aaronmcadam> with me?
[04:01:37] <blackspotwiggins> Onyx47, var a = {} a[name] = val
[04:01:37] <Onyx47> yeah
[04:01:56] <blackspotwiggins> or what was the original problem
[04:02:31] <aaronmcadam> $( container ).delegate( 'form', 'submit', function() { $( this ).serializeArray(); ); Onyx47
[04:02:59] <Onyx47> ok, this is what happens: I have 3 input fields containing product name, price and quantity
[04:03:19] <Onyx47> once you fill that out you can add another row to add another product
[04:03:48] <Onyx47> so yeah, storing it is no problem, but since I have multiples of each input it just keeps overwriting values
[04:03:56] <blackspotwiggins> Onyx47, use array types?
[04:04:02] <simulation> hello guys, how can i select appened elements id with jQuery ? for example if i append "<div id='blabla'></div>" how can i select blabla id ?
[04:04:07] <blackspotwiggins> product[][name]
[04:04:09] <blackspotwiggins> and so on
[04:04:15] <simulation> appended*
[04:04:19] <blackspotwiggins> they get parsed into arrays
[04:04:22] <blackspotwiggins> or should be at least
[04:05:05] * Onyx47 makes a neat hole in his wall using his head
[04:05:29] <simulation> anyone knows ?
[04:05:33] <blackspotwiggins> http://www.meh.ro/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/meh.ro5401.jpg
[04:06:19] <Onyx47> see, that's what happens when I overthink stuff and forget about the most simple solution in the world :P
[04:07:06] <aaronmcadam> yep happens
[04:07:25] <blackspotwiggins> experience helps in that area
[04:10:26] <VeXii> simulation: you can do the binding just after you appendet it.
[04:12:05] <aaronmcadam> simulation: use $.delegate
[04:12:08] <VeXii> might wanner check http://www.learningjquery.com/2008/03/working-with-events-part-1 as well :)
[04:12:14] <aaronmcadam> ?delegate @ simulation
[04:12:14] <bot-t> simulation, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:12:34] <aaronmcadam> that article's 3 years old VeXii much better ways now
[04:21:13] <antihero> Hmm, have an interesting javascript issue - I have a link that opens in an about="_blank" (so new tab) and I want to log the fact that it's been clicked. How would I do that?
[04:21:39] <simulation> aaronmcadam: let me check it thanks...
[04:22:07] <aaronmcadam> won't binding a click to it work antihero
[04:22:49] <aaronmcadam> you won't be able to preventDefault tho
[04:23:04] <aaronmcadam> 1 min
[04:23:24] <antihero> aaronmcadam: Thing is it could also potentially *not* open in a new window depending on a setting for the link.
[04:23:44] <antihero> aaronmcadam: So not doing preventDefault means the link is followed before the request can fire
[04:23:46] <aaronmcadam> one min
[04:24:14] <aaronmcadam> you're gonna have to add a class and then see
[04:24:19] <aaronmcadam> lemme try
[04:24:58] <antihero> indeed. it's just a pita as I think you can't simulate a "click" as that gets caught in browser popup filters
[04:25:11] <aaronmcadam> yea
[04:25:14] <aaronmcadam> shit
[04:25:17] <antihero> indee
[04:25:18] <antihero> d
[04:25:22] <aaronmcadam> window.open will cause popups
[04:25:34] <antihero> aaronmcadam: Aye but not tabs
[04:25:47] <antihero> if you see what I mean, I'd use that but the client wants it to be like a new tab :(
[04:25:48] <aaronmcadam> any programmatic opening will
[04:26:14] <aaronmcadam> works if you put just target="_blank" in the static html
[04:26:30] <antihero> aaronmcadam: But then the async does not get fired?
[04:26:31] <aaronmcadam> but if you try to programmatically do it you hit pop up blocking
[04:26:40] <aaronmcadam> what async
[04:26:57] <aaronmcadam> give me a min
[04:26:58] <antihero> essentially to log that the banner has been clicked, it fires a request at a page
[04:27:57] <aaronmcadam> it already does?
[04:27:58] <antihero> Oh wait, I found some code that seems to work
[04:28:22] <antihero> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/455874/
[04:28:26] <antihero> its rather complex
[04:28:37] <antihero> I found it on a site, and adapted it
[04:28:49] <antihero> honestly don't understand a lot of it :(
[04:28:54] <aaronmcadam> eesh
[04:28:58] <aaronmcadam> very hacky
[04:29:13] <antihero> I know :(
[04:29:15] <aaronmcadam> christ
[04:29:25] <antihero> Yeah. ignore the top 3 functions obviously.
[04:29:28] <aaronmcadam> don't use a 137 lines of code u don't understand
[04:30:00] <aaronmcadam> my idea
[04:30:07] <aaronmcadam> was to just add a class to the link
[04:30:16] <aaronmcadam> and preventDefault if it has the clss
[04:31:32] <antihero> aaronmcadam: How would that work
[04:31:50] <antihero> like after default prevented, how would link fire properly
[04:31:51] <aaronmcadam> well yeah
[04:32:04] <aaronmcadam> i'm confused now
[04:32:11] <aaronmcadam> u said u only wanted it to open properly
[04:32:15] <aaronmcadam> open once
[04:33:14] <blackspotwiggins> antihero, can you in one sentence explain what you are tryign to do?
[04:33:34] <antihero> Well
[04:33:37] <antihero> I managed it now
[04:34:27] <antihero> but to summarise. I want to have an async request fire to a page when a link is clicked, and the link may or may not have target="_blank", but must act with normal behaviour (so either open new tab or don't).
[04:34:27] <aaronmcadam> kk
[04:34:49] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[04:41:28] <RobertoBlanco> Hey there. Build a small Script to resize a DIV with the Width and Height of the Document to have it FullSize. When i resize the Browserwindow the DIV Dimension will not be updated. Is it possible?
[04:44:51] <derknecht_> i try to delegate a drag event (jQuery 1.6.2, UI 1.8.15). can someone give me a hint how? here is what i tried: http://nopaste.info/3388a7b804.html  Thanks a lot for any hint!
[04:48:26] <blackspotwiggins> RobertoBlanco, needs More capital Letters i Think
[04:48:47] <RobertoBlanco> blackspotwiggins: what?
[04:48:48] <coldhead> I*
[04:49:03] <blackspotwiggins> but position:absolute works
[04:49:17] <coldhead> he was admiring your Capitalisation, RobertoBlanco
[04:49:23] <coldhead> roll with it
[04:49:45] <MrSoundless> hey all\
[04:49:51] <RobertoBlanco> coldhead: any technical input? or just air?
[04:50:25] <MrSoundless> I need to reload my page right after I do an ajax call, the ajax call has to finish before the page reloads, I'm using location.reload in the complete event of the ajax function
[04:50:46] <MrSoundless> but what happens is that sometimes the ajax call finishes before the reload and sometimes it's not
[04:50:54] <MrSoundless> so it looks like it doesn't wait until the ajax call is finished
[04:51:03] <MrSoundless> is there a way to let it wait till it's done?
[04:52:38] <coldhead> i am not much good with technicality, Bob. it's my First Day using jQuery.
[04:53:12] <blackspotwiggins> RobertoBlanco, just use position:absolute and set all the offsets to 0
[04:53:16] <blackspotwiggins> like Magic
[04:54:03] <coldhead> MrSoundless: isn't the point of ajax that you don't need to do a page reload? can't you just not use the ajax and do a regular oldschool form post?
[04:54:21] <MrSoundless> coldhead, no can't, there are specific reasons for that
[04:54:42] <blackspotwiggins> MrSoundless, how do you determine that the page reloads before ajax is finished?
[04:55:02] <MrSoundless> in the call, I set some session variables, I notice that sometimes they do get set and sometimes they don't
[04:56:12] <MrSoundless> nvm
[04:56:24] <MrSoundless> I didnt' use the event the way it should've been used
[04:56:40] <MrSoundless> I had to assign a function to it, but what I did is call reload directly
[04:56:45] <noobie25> can someone explain how i can POST to a url?
[04:57:04] <MrSoundless> so I had 'complete' => location.reload() instead of 'complete' => function() { location.reload(); }
[04:57:31] <noobie25> I think i'm suppose to use $.ajax
[04:57:34] <MrSoundless> srry for bothering u dudes :p
[04:57:43] <MrSoundless> noobie25, u can use $.post
[04:58:30] <noobie25> MrSoundless,   thanks....i'll look up that instead :)
[04:58:55] <MrSoundless> yw, you could use $.ajax, but if you just want to do a post $.post is gonna be easier
[05:07:29] <michael> hey
[05:08:17] <Guest66835> iam looking for a way to store a var for a session but the cookie plugin dont work with chrome can some one help me ?
[05:09:16] <theCode> hey guys, how do you do a $('h2').the-3rd-one()
[05:09:34] <theCode> there are many h2s, i need the 3rd one
[05:09:35] <aaronmcadam> eq(2)
[05:09:42] <theCode> hmm lemme try
[05:11:37] <theCode> works!
[05:12:12] <blackspotwiggins> Guest66835, if you dont need to send/receive info from server then use sessionStorage instead
[05:12:56] <noobie25> when i do a .post   .... and want to send the following data  {first: "john", last:"doe" },  how can i create a variable above with this data?
[05:13:33] <noobie25> MrSoundless,    thanks.... i got my .post working instead of using .ajax.   What the difference by the way?
[05:13:50] <MrSoundless> afaik, post is just a wrapper around ajax
[05:13:50] <Guest66835> blackspotwiggins, the thing is i must do a intro animation that only should come once a day or a sessesion or something else. i will look for the plugin
[05:14:03] <blackspotwiggins> what plugin?
[05:14:40] <Guest66835> blackspotwiggins, jQuery.handleStorage
[05:14:52] <blackspotwiggins> why do you need a plugin ?
[05:15:18] <Guest66835> blackspotwiggins, i thought that sessionStorage is a plugin ^^
[05:15:33] <blackspotwiggins> it isnt really
[05:16:32] <Guest66835> blackspotwiggins, sessionStorage is a html5 thing but i need the page to work in older IE's...
[05:16:35] <derknecht_> i try to delegate a drag event .(jQuery 1.6.2, UI 1.8.15). I  have a canvas that gets the mouse click event, and want to move a representive element instead of the canvas. can someone give me a hint plz? here is a code snipped what i tried: http://pastebin.de/18180code:
[05:16:51] <blackspotwiggins> Guest66835, tough shit then.
[05:18:15] <Guest66835> or i make the intro and then with ajax i forward the hole page to a new one with an animation hmmm
[05:23:03] <RobertoBlanco> blackspotwiggins: thanks, was one of the things that helped
[05:30:40] <antihero> Grr, now my callback isn't firing :(
[05:31:29] <antihero> why would a $.getJSON callback refuse to fire even though the request is returning 200?
[05:31:43] <antihero> ah got it
[05:31:45] <blackspotwiggins> antihero, json is not correctly formatted
[05:36:30] <mazzachre> Have anyone ever tried using .live on a windows mobile 6 IE browser?
[05:36:53] <antihero> cool.
[05:37:10] <antihero> W.T.F. it seems that window.open() does different stuff depending on my context :S
[05:37:31] <antihero> If I put it outside my callback it works correctly, opening a new tab. If I put it inside my callback, it opens a stupid popup
[05:38:29] <siovene> Hello.
[05:38:37] <mazzachre> I have a problem with my page on wm6 IE where it will show the page for an instant and the go to blank page... And cut it down to only one function in document.ready where I do $('#x').live('change', function() {...});
[05:38:57] <aaronmcadam> that's the problem using hacky code ya can't understand
[05:39:14] <siovene> If I have something like: $myElem.append("<div></div>"), how can I have a variable that will point at that <div> element I just appended?
[05:39:26] <Heliodor> how do i select the img child of this?
[05:40:06] <Cork> ?.find @ Hellojere
[05:40:06] <bot-t> Hellojere, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[05:40:26] <Cork> Heliodor: just wrap this with $() and search for it
[05:40:34] <Heliodor> Cork: thanks!
[05:41:04] <antihero> Why would the behaviour of window.open change because I'm in a callback?
[05:41:07] <antihero> :(
[05:41:07] <Heliodor> Cork: like this? $(this).find().attr("src")
[05:41:25] <blackspotwiggins> mazzachre, i dont think wm6 ie is supported in jquery..
[05:41:39] <blackspotwiggins> don't*
[05:43:20] <mazzachre> It seems not :s Oh well, can't support everything :)
[05:44:06] <graingert> heya
[05:44:21] <graingert> the receive callback doesn't seem to be being called on my sortable
[05:44:40] <blackspotwiggins> mazzachre, to be fair, it's 4 years old
[05:45:10] <blackspotwiggins> it's the first mobile ie that supported js at all iirc
[05:51:59] <aaronmcadam> what u caring about win mobile 6 forrrr
[05:53:01] <Heliodor> when i use appendTo it adds the div to the bottom of the list of divs, how do i add it to the top?
[05:53:16] <Cork> ?.after @ Heliodor
[05:53:16] <bot-t> Heliodor, .after(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[05:53:28] <Heliodor> Cork: appendAfter?
[05:53:44] <Cork> ops sorry wrong command ;P
[05:53:55] <mazzachre> aaronmcadam: Well.. it is there... And my customer have asked for a mobile page that works on "everything"... I will just have to disclude wm6 from "everything" :D
[05:53:55] <Cork> prepend is what you want
[05:54:20] <Heliodor> Cork: prependTo?
[05:54:22] <Cork> Heliodor: so see ?.prependTo
[05:54:22] <bot-t> Heliodor, .prependTo(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the beginning of the target. http://api.jquery.com/prependTo/
[05:54:27] <rhino> what is a more efficient way of writing this bit of code:  $(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().toggleClass('highlightselected');  ?
[05:54:52] <rhino> $(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().toggleClass('highlightselected');
[05:55:14] <Cork> rhino: add a class to the parent your looking for and use closest see ?.closest
[05:55:14] <bot-t> rhino, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[05:55:19] <Nacho__> When using .find, how can I see if anything was actually found?
[05:55:34] <blackspotwiggins> Nacho__, check the .length
[05:55:40] <bung> Cork: that might look nicer, but is it more efficient?
[05:55:59] <aaronmcadam> lol
[05:56:03] <bung> an id attribute would be best right?
[05:56:09] <blackspotwiggins> bung, you could do parentNode.parentNode ... as well
[05:56:15] <aaronmcadam> selectors do fail silently tho IMTheNachoMan
[05:56:24] <Heliodor> Cork: It still adds it to the bottom :-S
[05:56:30] <Heliodor> Cork: SORRY
[05:56:35] <Heliodor> Cork: My fault
[05:56:48] <IMTheNachoMan> If I just want the first element or null, is there a quick way to do that?
[05:56:58] <graingert> can anyone spot why the recieve event is not firing: http://jsfiddle.net/5eR5a/2/
[05:57:10] <aaronmcadam> mazzachre: you talking about jquery mobile?
[05:58:16] <aaronmcadam> Windows Phone 6.5 is
[05:59:00] <aaronmcadam> look at the platforms here mazzachre http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/
[05:59:04] <graingert> I am such a noob

[06:25:29] <Narhir> hi
[06:25:42] <Narhir> anyone know how is called this script that was used here for clicking on "read more"? http://www.mediamind.com/content.aspx?page=executive_management
[06:26:38] <pif> hi, I want to select all buttons inside the 'manage_form' form element, is this correct? $('form[name="manage_form"] :button')
[06:29:40] <bricker> pif: $('form #manage_form button')
[06:29:56] <pif> #manage_form is not an id
[06:30:17] <bricker> pif: what is manage_form then?
[06:30:45] <Rushing> a name lol
[06:30:46] <bricker> Narhir: look up jQuery 'slideToggle'
[06:30:46] <pif> <form name="manage_form">
[06:30:53] <Rushing> pif, yes that is correct
[06:31:00] <Rushing> your original selector
[06:31:10] <Narhir> thanks bricker
[06:31:33] <pif> Rushing: hmm, doesn't work, however this does: $('form[name="manage_form"] input[type="submit"]')
[06:32:12] <pif> isn't :button a filter which must be appended somehow?
[06:32:18] <Rushing> sounds like the pseudo selector :button isn't working. try *:button?
[06:32:36] <Rushing> without the question mark, of course
[06:33:43] <kborchers> Rushing, pif: :button will not select submit buttons since they are not button elements, they are inputs.
[06:34:01] <phlp> pif: there is also a :submit selector
[06:34:07] <pif> submits are not buttons ??
[06:34:18] <kborchers> pif: no
[06:34:26] <pif> hmmkay
[06:34:33] <kborchers> <input type="submit" /> vs. <button />
[06:34:50] <Rushing> well yeah, but then why not just use "button"
[06:35:52] <Rushing> ah, input type=button also returns with :button
[06:36:13] <Rushing> which is also an input, but i guess they're just distinguishing submit and reset
[06:36:30] <pif> oh well
[06:36:32] <Rushing> so pif, :button could be thought of as a "generic" button selector, not for submit or reset
[06:36:51] <kborchers> right see ?button-selector
[06:36:53] <bot-t> kborchers, :button Selector - Selects all button elements and elements of type button. http://api.jquery.com/button-selector/
[06:37:14] <Rushing> so you'd probably want to do $("form[name=whatever]").find(":button,:submit,:reset")
[06:37:38] <pif> ok
[06:37:48] <Rushing> or $("form[name=whatever] *").filter(":button,:submit,:reset") if you want them in their DOM order

[06:39:57] <noobie25> how do i create a request variable before i make a $.post call?     I tried:     var data;   data["firstname"] = John                but doesn't seem to work.
[06:40:02] <kborchers> phlp: quicker on the draw ;)
[06:41:27] <Birliban> hi, can someone help me aout with this: http://jsfiddle.net/m9xze/ problem with closest(), see inline comments.
[06:42:13] <kborchers> noobie25: your data needs to be in querystring format so like x=1&y=2... if you're building it yourself, you need to build it that way. if you're getting the data from a form you should see ?serialize
[06:42:14] <bot-t> noobie25, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[06:43:27] <Tizard> Someone would know why, with Jeditable, when I validate a field, he replaces me with the reponse (normal...) but with a new line before

[06:44:03] <phlp> Birliban: div.head is not inside span.abs http://jsfiddle.net/m9xze/2
[06:44:20] <bricker> Any ideas why the events might not be showing up on FullCalendar? I'm querying successfully and rendering a JSON array with the proper elements for FullCalendar, but it just won't display.
[06:45:45] <noobie25> kborchers,    thanks for your help.    i think i understand.     1)    var str = $("form").serialize()  2)   use 'str' as my data variable in    $.post ?
[06:46:03] <kborchers> noobie25: yep
[06:46:50] <Birliban> phlp, ah i see, so if i want to find smth withi closest, the element has to be wrapped around...
[06:47:16] <noobie25> kborchers,   if i wanted to manually serialize my data without using the .serialize() function .... is this the same thing?    var str = "firstname=john&lastname=doe"?
[06:47:28] <kborchers> noobie25: yes
[06:47:37] <phlp> Birliban: yes closest finds the first ancestor that matches the selector
[06:47:43] <noobie25> kborchers, ..... thank you so much~~~  i'll have to try that again....

[06:49:17] <tonthon> Hi, I'm trying to use jqueryui's datepicker with the french translation but I'm facing the following bug : $.datepicker is undefined
[06:49:57] <noobie25> kborchers,    it worked perfectly...thank you;)
[06:50:08] <kborchers> :)
[06:50:13] <tonthon> I'm using the jquery-ui 1.8.11 and I use cj in place of the classic $
[06:50:41] <monk12> Off topic: ... quick web dev question... is there any web dev tool that finds http requests on https sites? I had to look a few levels in a css file to find a reference to import a http://google font thing hah.
[06:50:48] <siovene> Hello! I'm writing a jquery-ui plugin and would like to use some 3rd party JS for some generic funciton it provides; I don't want to force the user of my jquery-ui widget to have to remember to include that JS file. How can I include it from within my jquery .js file?
[06:50:55] <tonthon> does somebody know where I can look (replacing $ with cj solves my problem)
[06:50:59] <monk12> (to stop those IE https popups)
[06:50:59] <Birliban> phlp, now is see. thanks!!!
[06:51:07] <phlp> Birliban: np :)
[06:51:16] <seutje> $img.bind('load', someHandler); $img.each(function() { if (this.complete) { someHandler.call(this); } }); <- this can't be the optimal way to handle this, can it?
[06:51:40] <kborchers> tonthon: are you including another library that uses the $?
[06:52:03] <tonthon> kborchers, yes I do
[06:52:11] <kborchers> then that's your problem
[06:52:38] <kborchers> you could just use jQuery instead of $
[06:52:43] <tonthon> kborchers, why should it be a problem since the translation is launched with Jquery(function($) ?
[06:53:43] <stygyan> hello guys
[06:53:45] <kborchers> has nothing to do with the translation, if you try to instatiate the datepicker with $.datepicker, it is most likely trying to find datepicker in your other library and thus is undefined
[06:54:11] <tonthon> kborchers, datepicker is working well, only translation of it doesn't work
[06:54:54] <tonthon> I instantiate my datepicker with cj.datepicker (cj is my chosen alias)
[06:55:39] <theCode> $('input type=text').keydown(function(e) <-- midoing rite?
[06:55:58] <kborchers> that's why it works ... you aren't using $ there. it might help to see your code
[06:56:02] <kborchers> ?p @ tonthon
[06:56:03] <bot-t> tonthon, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:56:20] <tonthon> http://pastebin.com/dZrLfvsf (original code not working)
[06:56:39] <seutje> kborchers: something tells me it looks something like https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/i18n/jquery.ui.datepicker-de.js
[06:56:40] <phlp> theCode: $('input[type="text"]')
[06:56:44] <tonthon> http://pastebin.com/pZMgU9eS working version
[06:56:46] <theCode> oh i see
[06:56:52] <theCode> thanks bro
[06:57:33] <seutje> that's mighty funky, since doc rdy documentation states that the first argument passed to the rdy handler is the jquery object
[06:58:53] <tonthon> seutje, yes I think there is something strange there in ($ is defined but doesn't own all the properties cj -in my example - does )
[06:58:59] <phlp> tonthon: did you include the translation after the datepicker script?
[06:59:08] <tonthon> phlp, yes
[06:59:29] <bricker> oh I am so stupid I had "allDayDefault" set to true, but was hiding the "allDay" header the event was thought to be an "all-day" event but I was hiding the place where it was supposed to be showing. dumb dumb dumb.
[07:00:50] <kborchers> tonthon: hmmm, that is strange. can you console.log($) inside there and see if it is jQuery or something else ... just for my curiosity?
[07:01:07] <Sean-Der> $("body").delegate("input.[class^=finalPrice]", "blur", function(){
[07:01:16] <brugby> hola kids
[07:01:21] <Sean-Der> Is that the correct selector for all classes that begin with finalPrice?
[07:01:53] <kborchers> Sean-Der: no try $("body").delegate("input[class^='finalPrice']", "blur", function(){
[07:03:58] <Sean-Der> Hmm still no go with a class name of finalPriceNrc I think my javascript is having issues somewhere else

[07:06:42] <orplac> whats the best way to compare a two level array using a method similar to the double or triple equals?
[07:06:47] <tonthon> kborchers, I've got it, another plugin was also importing Jquery (another version of it) and it brought the mess
[07:07:04] <kborchers> doh ... glad you found it. new there was a conflict somewhere
[07:07:05] <tonthon> so $ was pointing on Jquery but not the good one
[07:07:10] <orplac> cause at least when i compare my two arrays using == or === it always returns true, even if they are totally different
[07:07:34] <tonthon> kborchers, thanks for the time you accorded to me
[07:07:39] <kborchers> no problem
[07:09:51] <mercury_> hello. One quick question. Is it posiible to just clone element content <div id="test"> content </div> -> to get just content text ?
[07:10:17] <mercury_> i know to get html but i need clone function because im having <input type="file"> inside this div.

[07:13:23] <kborchers> mercury_: heh, no problem. i just love when i get a chance to use that one ;)
[07:15:01] <phobia> hi :) I'm having a hard time with scope. for a click event I need to both know the element that was clicked, and have "this" to be the object the code is within. Any pointers on how I can fix this? http://pastebin.com/5N7W6XFC
[07:15:08] <Sean-Der> I am stumped kborchers if I use the selector "input.finalPriceMrc" or "input.finalPriceNrc" it works great, but attempting to wildcard with "input[class^='finalPrice']"
[07:15:12] <Sean-Der> Is a no go
[07:15:25] <oly> hi, can anyone tell me if there is anything wrong with doing $('a').has('img').live('mouseover',function(){}); instead of $('a:has(img)').live('mouseover',function(){}); the latter works and the first example does not
[07:15:28] <aaronmcadam> pass the context in
[07:15:35] <oly> just curious if anyone can tell me why
[07:15:42] <aaronmcadam> or try $.proxy see ?proxy phobia
[07:15:42] <bot-t> jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[07:15:46] <kborchers> Sean-Der: is there more than one class on the input? if so, and finalPrice... isn't first, it won't work
[07:16:27] <Sean-Der> kborchers: Ohh didn't think about that yes there is I can move it around though the other classes are for form validation
[07:16:31] <phobia> aaronmcadam: how would I pass the context?
[07:16:38] <mercury_> how can i get div content with contents ... i really dont know how to use this function.
[07:17:04] <aaronmcadam> phobia: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide31
[07:17:12] <kborchers> Sean-Der: or you could just use "input[class*='finalPrice']"
[07:17:38] <phobia> aaronmcadam: thanks :)
[07:17:42] <aaronmcadam> np
[07:17:50] <Sean-Der> Instead of the ^ because ^ is begins with correct?
[07:17:59] <aaronmcadam> yes
[07:18:00] <Sean-Der> Thanks for all the help kborchers by the way!
[07:18:10] <aaronmcadam> what a nice guy
[07:18:11] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[07:18:13] <kborchers> Sean-Der: yes, * would be better. you shouldn't have your code depend on the order of the classes
[07:18:59] <StyXLT> is it possible to select something after a particular element
[07:19:16] <kborchers> ?next @ StyXLT
[07:19:17] <bot-t> StyXLT, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[07:19:25] <aaronmcadam> ah u beat me to it kborchers
[07:19:26] <aaronmcadam> :P
[07:19:29] <kborchers> ;)
[07:19:43] <aaronmcadam> go commit some jq ui code or something :P
[07:19:44] <aaronmcadam> haha
[07:19:47] <kborchers> heh
[07:19:56] <kborchers> working on position changes right now
[07:20:03] <aaronmcadam> was just bout to ask u
[07:20:13] <aaronmcadam> cool
[07:20:28] <StyXLT> what i'm trying to do is to append some html code after a heading tag
[07:20:34] <kborchers> better collision handling and also a flipfit collision option
[07:20:43] <StyXLT> $("#template .widget").next('h3').append('something');
[07:21:01] <StyXLT> so in this case i would append something into the h3
[07:21:11] <StyXLT> and i need to append right after h3
[07:21:32] <kborchers> StyXLT: is the h3 a sibling to the .widget element?
[07:21:59] <StyXLT> yes. it's inside widget
[07:22:08] <kborchers> StyXLT: that's not a sibling, that's a child
[07:22:13] <StyXLT> oh darn
[07:22:18] <StyXLT> sorry haha
[07:22:47] <aaronmcadam> StyXLT: you want .after() i think
[07:22:58] <kborchers> $("something").insertAfter($("#template .widget").children('h3:first'));
[07:23:00] <aaronmcadam> oh yeah
[07:23:00] <kborchers> try that
[07:23:01] <aaronmcadam> find
[07:23:06] <aaronmcadam> ooh nice
[07:24:21] <aaronmcadam> or .eq(0)
[07:25:02] <antihero> can I get jquery to terminate any existing animation on an object
[07:25:02] <aaronmcadam> i always try to avoid those pseudo selector looking ones
[07:25:08] <aaronmcadam> .stop()
[07:25:08] <antihero> so say I'm fading out and Iw ant to fade back in
[07:25:21] <aaronmcadam> fadeIn().stop().fadeOut()
[07:25:28] <kborchers> aaronmcadam: i think it's a little faster to do it in a single selector, rather than filter with a second selector
[07:25:53] <aaronmcadam> yeah I just try to do what's fastest
[07:25:58] <antihero> aaronmcadam: but it's triggered by previous event
[07:26:00] <aaronmcadam> but yeah
[07:26:16] <aaronmcadam> you're back, hi
[07:26:31] <aaronmcadam> but what is?
[07:27:24] <antihero> ok so I have a click function that triggers a 200ms fadein and a 5000ms fadeout
[07:27:32] <aaronmcadam> hey maqr you there?
[07:27:32] <antihero> the 5000ms is the callback of the 200ms
[07:27:41] <aaronmcadam> ah
[07:27:45] <aaronmcadam> you need to use the queue
[07:27:47] <antihero> aaronmcadam: but I want if I click it again to ignore what it was doing
[07:27:59] <antihero> and fade back in
[07:28:38] <aaronmcadam> all these fades are needed right :p
[07:30:50] <antihero> aaronmcadam: Just for niceness :)
[07:31:02] <antihero> aaronmcadam: Ok so I'm using stop() infront of the fadeIn
[07:31:10] <queso> How do I get the location of the cursor in a text field?
[07:31:11] <aaronmcadam> sometimes too many fades kills ux a bit tho
[07:31:26] <aaronmcadam> a 5 second fade in is a bit extreme
[07:31:49] <mercury_> .children works like a charm :)
[07:31:49] <kborchers> aaronmcadam antihero: i was just going to say i would find all of that fading more annoying than nice. just my opinion though
[07:32:07] <aaronmcadam> yup
[07:32:13] <antihero> ignoring that
[07:32:16] <kborchers> heh
[07:32:16] <codecowboy> Hi. I am doing $('div').not('#motivation').block({ message: null }); where block is from the blockUI plugin. I'm expecting that the block function will run on all divs apart from #motivation but everything gets blocked - is the not() call correct?
[07:32:19] <aaronmcadam> you make your children work?
[07:32:21] <aaronmcadam> evil man
[07:32:22] <antihero> now my issue is that it only fades in to a certain opacity
[07:32:30] <aaronmcadam> hah bugger
[07:32:44] <mercury_> yes :)
[07:32:58] <aaronmcadam> lol
[07:33:07] <antihero> ah well
[07:33:22] <aaronmcadam> codecowboy: should be ok, check what the result is before calling block
[07:33:35] <aaronmcadam> and check the plugin's docs
[07:34:29] <dr0id> why the hell $('form#id').submit(); won't submit the form ? :|
[07:34:31] <safzouf> hi
[07:34:36] <safzouf> does anyone used webservices?
[07:34:47] <safzouf> how to make filters on date/time?
[07:34:56] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[07:36:12] <seutje> dr0id: what does $('form#id').length return?
[07:36:30] <dr0id> 1
[07:36:42] <dr0id> I had to create a hidden submit button and .click() on that to submit it :P
[07:37:55] <roger_padactor> does jquery store data in an element if when you put a data="" in the tag?
[07:38:17] <aaronmcadam> no
[07:38:19] <seutje> nosir
[07:38:19] <aaronmcadam> you do it this way
[07:38:28] <aaronmcadam> data-element="bla"
[07:38:32] <seutje> dr0id: wtf, makes no sense o.O
[07:38:34] <codecowboy> aaronmcadam: thanks. the selector looks ok. I guess the parent and all children are blocked
[07:38:44] <aaronmcadam> then $(el).data( 'element' );
[07:38:53] <dr0id> seutje: yeah, I don't know why it didn't submit
[07:39:02] <aaronmcadam> you can't use $.data so be careful
[07:39:16] <seutje> haha, this might have been a bad idea: http://jsbin.com/overar
[07:39:17] <dr0id> basically, $('form#id').submit(); didn't submit the form, so just to make it work I created a hidden submit button and click(); that :P
[07:39:20] <roger_padactor> thanks
[07:39:20] <dr0id> have to complete it fast ;)
[07:39:30] <aaronmcadam> don't tie too much data to the dom tho
[07:39:43] <aaronmcadam> use backbone or something similar if you need lots of data to be saved
[07:40:17] <roger_padactor> its not alot.
[07:40:34] <dr0id> my backbone is hurting atm
[07:40:45] <seutje> reminder to self: don't make a page that has a form that submits to itself onload
[07:41:24] <ajpiano> seutje: WRT to image load.... i'm not even sure what you posted is "adequate"
[07:41:35] <ajpiano> like if you look at pauls' imagesLoaded or what ended up in masonry
[07:41:38] <seutje> whatumean?
[07:41:50] <ajpiano> 1 sec i'll show you
[07:42:16] <ajpiano> seutje: https://github.com/desandro/masonry/blob/master/jquery.masonry.js#L376-423
[07:42:39] <seutje> senku, found https://gist.github.com/797120/a82f93e283c3a7891aeed0606348dc123a7de957
[07:43:03] <ajpiano> ah seems like its same
[07:43:40] <seutje> ajpiano: so my .complete thingy is shit?
[07:44:06] <ajpiano> i can't say with certitude, just that every impl i've seen has a bit more complexity than just checking for the complete :)
[07:44:07] <VorTechS> hmmm, is it possible to select by id OR name with wildcards?
[07:44:40] <seutje> VorTechS: $('#id, [name="someName"]') ?
[07:44:41] <VorTechS> as in: .find('[id^=Input_')
[07:45:03] <seutje> oh, sure, I guess
[07:45:08] <VorTechS> so the id or name begins with Input
[07:45:51] <seutje> .find('[id^=Input_], [name^=Input_]') or something
[07:46:08] <VorTechS> oh, cool - thanks, I'll have a play! :)
[07:49:07] <VorTechS> seutje: that looks to be the answer! Thank you! :)
[07:50:26] <DrBitch> hello
[07:50:39] <DrBitch> I have a input which name is "event[name]"
[07:50:49] <DrBitch> how can I access to that element using jquery?
[07:53:31] <phlp> $('input[name="event\\[name\\]"]')
[07:54:35] <aaronmcadam> eeeehh
[07:54:37] <DrBitch> TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$('input[name="event\\[name\\]"]').tagit()')
[07:54:42] <phlp> actually you might not need the escaping $('input[name="event[name]"]')
[07:54:43] <aaronmcadam> lol
[07:54:50] <aaronmcadam> yes u will
[07:54:56] <aaronmcadam> if it's a variable
[07:55:05] <phlp> either one is working for me
[07:55:06] <aaronmcadam> you'll need to concat
[07:55:22] <DrBitch> its the name of an input
[07:55:27] <aaronmcadam> ah k
[07:55:29] <DrBitch> its event[name], event[date], and so..
[07:55:35] <DrBitch> nothing works
[07:55:47] <aaronmcadam> you know the drill
[07:55:50] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ DrBitch
[07:55:50] <bot-t> DrBitch, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:57:34] <phlp> http://jsfiddle.net/XDQfy
[07:59:34] <aaronmcadam> no need for those backslashes
[07:59:41] <aaronmcadam> just makes the code unreadable
[08:00:13] <seutje> aaronmcadam: it's not a variable, it's <input name="event[name]" />
[08:00:14] <osmosis_paul> Hey guys somebody can tell me how can i specify a date format when i using datepicker???? by default he use yyyy/mm/dd
[08:00:16] <aaronmcadam> I know you're just illustrating your point
[08:00:20] <aaronmcadam> i know
[08:00:30] <aaronmcadam> RTFM dude
[08:00:36] <aaronmcadam> it's right there in the docs
[08:00:45] <kborchers> aaronmcadam: this one's better
[08:00:51] <kborchers> ?rtfm @ osmosis_paul
[08:00:52] <bot-t> osmosis_paul, http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page is your friend
[08:00:55] <aaronmcadam> haha yeah I said earlier
[08:00:59] <seutje> haha forreal
[08:01:09] <aaronmcadam> all he's askin us to do is look up the API for him
[08:01:21] <kborchers> although ... he would need http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[08:01:25] <aaronmcadam> yep
[08:01:30] <seutje> ?g jquery ui datepicker options
[08:01:31] <osmosis_paul> kborchers, already read the f*** manual and i dont found the way
[08:01:32] <bot-t> seutje, jQuery UI - Datepicker Demos & Documentation - http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[08:01:34] <phlp> actually the docs say if [ or ] is "a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes"
[08:01:46] <seutje> no anchor link? bastard!
[08:01:55] <osmosis_paul> kborchers, but well i will follow with google, thanks anyway
[08:01:58] <phlp> but clearly it works without escaping
[08:02:28] <seutje> phlp: but the double quotes...
[08:02:33] <kborchers> osmosis_paul: ok, go to the second link i sent, click the options tab, scroll down to dateFormat, read
[08:03:22] <seutje> phlp: u'd need to escape if ur not using quotes -> $('input[name=event\\[name\\]]') vs $('input[name="event[name]"]')
[08:03:34] <danheberden> always use quotes
[08:03:43] <seutje> INORITE?
[08:04:15] <aaronmcadam> simples
[08:04:16] <phlp> yes i know seutje i'm just repeating what the docs say. always use quotes and always escape those characters as part of a name.
[08:04:16] <danheberden> aye :)
[08:04:34] <aaronmcadam> or just name your inputs differently
[08:04:38] <aaronmcadam> ...
[08:04:55] <danheberden> well some frameworks are a pain with the brackets use
[08:04:56] <seutje> osmosis_paul: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-dateFormat the way findeth you!
[08:04:58] <danheberden> like cakephp
[08:05:08] <seutje> isn't cake a pain by definition?
[08:05:19] <danheberden> meh, not when you don't use any of the helpers :)
[08:05:27] <seutje> been a while since I've used it
[08:05:39] <bjhaid> i need to iterate over a multi-dimentional array like i have here https://gist.github.com/1137043
[08:05:43] <deltaray> Can anyone recommend a good password strength plugin for jquery. The digitalspaghetti one seems broken.
[08:05:50] <deltaray> and unmaintained.
[08:05:53] <blackspotwiggins> bracketed names are useful for sending arrays
[08:06:04] <blackspotwiggins> the problem is selecting them in another way
[08:06:14] <danheberden> deltaray good reading before you get too far: http://xkcd.com/936/
[08:06:18] <aaronmcadam> I know why it's bracketed blackspotwiggins
[08:06:24] <danheberden> .length might just be your friend in making one :D
[08:06:29] <seutje> danheberden: giggedy giggedy
[08:06:42] <aaronmcadam> I'd probably do it differently is all
[08:06:53] <blackspotwiggins> with lazers
[08:06:58] <seutje> I changed all my passwords to "correct horse battery staple" today
[08:07:04] <danheberden> bjhaid then iterate
[08:07:08] <aaronmcadam> oh no, there's no jquery plugin for lazers :(
[08:07:17] <danheberden> ?each @ bjhaid
[08:07:17] <bot-t> bjhaid, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[08:07:18] <blackspotwiggins> wasnt there?
[08:07:21] <blackspotwiggins> i remember something
[08:07:25] <aaronmcadam> nope, so I can't use it
[08:07:26] <seutje> 9/10 sites/services gave me a "password too long" error or some shit about it not having funky chars :(
[08:07:30] <aaronmcadam> *jokes*
[08:07:37] <bjhaid> danheberden: how do i pick the array inside of the array
[08:07:40] <DrBitch> thanks you! nothing worked, i used an id
[08:07:41] <DrBitch> byez
[08:07:51] <blackspotwiggins> hah
[08:08:02] <seutje> ?g jquery lazer eyes
[08:08:03] <bot-t> seutje, jQuery | Awesome But Useless - http://awesomebutuseless.com/tag/jquery/
[08:08:26] <danheberden> bjhaid it'd be your value brah
[08:08:27] <blackspotwiggins> that was laserey.es iirc
[08:08:47] <bjhaid> danheberden: so i would have a nested loop right?
[08:08:47] <osmosis_paul> seutje, that's precisally the documentation that i was reading but how can i specify the format?
[08:08:54] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: yessir, it is
[08:09:06] <blackspotwiggins> but there was something else
[08:09:15] <blackspotwiggins> disco laser images
[08:09:29] <danheberden> ?eval  var total = 0; $.each( [ [1,2], [3,4], [5,6] ], function() { $.each( this, function() { total += this; }); });
[08:09:30] <bot-t> danheberden: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
[08:09:30] <seutje> osmosis_paul: lemme copy/paste for u: $( ".selector" ).datepicker({ dateFormat: 'yy-mm-dd' });
[08:09:37] <danheberden> oops
[08:09:46] <danheberden> ?eval var total = 0; $.each( [ [1,2], [3,4], [5,6] ], function() { $.each( this, function() { total += this; }); }); total;
[08:09:47] <bot-t> danheberden: 21
[08:09:53] <seutje> osmosis_paul: or even $( ".selector" ).datepicker( "option", "dateFormat", 'yy-mm-dd' );
[08:09:59] <danheberden> see bjhaid ?
[08:10:34] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: I assume this can easily be tweaked to have rainbow lazers :P
[08:10:35] <danheberden> the `this` in the first each is each array, the `this` in the second each is each element in the array
[08:10:41] <osmosis_paul> seutje, i was copy the code of the example of format date, let's see of works and if not try your way thanks!!!
[08:10:56] <seutje> osmosis_paul: that *IS* the example
[08:12:06] <bjhaid> danheberden: thanks
[08:19:20] <deltaray> danheberden: Yeah, I saw that. Already an XKCD reader.  Actually I feel like I'm the inspiration for that comic as I was just making the same points that he made on a mailing list 3 weeks ago. Sure its just coincidence though.
[08:20:19] <deltaray> If the encryption scheme is still DES, then using a passphrase is dangerous because it only considers the first 8 characters.
[08:21:03] <deltaray> So anyways, anyone recommend a pass strength plugin besides the digitalspaghetti one?
[08:22:58] <phlp> first thing i thought of was this http://www.baekdal.com/tips/password-security-usability
[08:25:17] <jeffsmykil> Anyone have any CSS transform experience?
[08:28:24] <Heliodor> I have a few link, and i want to add a data attribute that shows the links position in the dom. data="1" data="2" etc. How would i do that?
[08:30:02] <imgrey> good evening #jquery
[08:30:24] <kborchers> good morning imgrey ;)
[08:30:28] <imgrey> could someone please remind me how to select elements after N position ?
[08:30:37] <imgrey> like tr[2:]

[08:30:57] <Heliodor> I have a few link, and i want to add a data attribute that shows the links position in the dom. data="1" data="2" etc. How would i do that?
[08:31:17] <NoNoNo> imgrey: http://jqapi.com/#p=slice
[08:31:28] <NoNoNo> Slice and dice :)
[08:31:42] <imgrey> no, I remember other method
[08:31:44] <imgrey> without slice
[08:31:53] <phlp> imgrey: 'tr:gt(0)'
[08:31:57] <imgrey> right
[08:32:00] <imgrey> phlp, thank you
[08:32:07] <NoNoNo> yep, even nicer
[08:32:23] <imgrey> can I combinate it with odd ?
[08:32:25] <imgrey> tr:gt(0):odd ?
[08:32:36] <StyXLT> if i fetch some content via ajax, which has <script> tag in it. will it execute it?
[08:32:42] <imgrey> aparently yes
[08:35:15] <earlz_work> Is it possible to use `bind` for the slideUp/slideDown eventS?
[08:41:40] <bjhaid> danheberden: I would paste my codes now, i still have issues with getting the elements in a multi-dimensional array

[08:46:28] <DukeDrake> hi guys
[08:47:22] <semanty> hi, is  $(".to_answer[id=''+question_id+'']") possible?
[08:48:22] <Iarfen> hi
[08:48:34] <Iarfen> how I can disable the jquery ajax functions a while?
[08:50:29] <semanty> i notice Attribute Contains Prefix Selector  use $('input[name=value]'), how about &$('.answer[name=value])')
[08:51:19] <danheberden> semanty why wouldn't you just use the id selector? $( '#' + question_id );
[08:51:37] <danheberden> also there is no reference operator for JS, e.g. &$(...
[08:52:31] <greytrilby> take 2
[08:52:35] <greytrilby> damn thing crashed on me
[08:52:52] <greytrilby> anyone know a good php chat room? (or can someone spare me a minute on some php?)
[08:53:11] <nguyendh> hi, any idea how to slide down a div, stay there for 3 secs, then slide up that div again ?
[08:53:25] <semanty> danheberden, that will be a little complex for my code
[08:53:27] <nguyendh> im stucked at 'stay there for 3 secs' part after the slide down
[08:53:41] <greytrilby> nguy = try "delay"
[08:53:46] <danheberden> semanty complex? getting something by id?
[08:53:47] <greytrilby> delay()
[08:54:13] <sasori> question: how to remove the horizontal and vertial scroll bar of a jquery modal form?
[08:54:26] <nguyendh> thanks
[08:54:31] <greytrilby> np
[08:54:35] <danheberden> sasori that'd be a css question
[08:54:44] <danheberden> or, more specifically, a css answer
[08:54:51] <thebignoise> does anyone know the proper syntax to get jquery ui progess bar to work with a modal
[08:55:06] <greytrilby> mydiv { overflow:hidden } would do it.
[08:55:29] <greytrilby> or make the div bigger )
[08:55:32] <greytrilby> :)
[08:55:59] <sasori> css ?, aren't there any existing options to tweak it via the jquery ui itself ?
[08:56:00] <danheberden> or more specifically, .ui-dialog-content
[08:56:22] <danheberden> sasori, why would you use JS for your styles? there's that whole css framework for a reason :D
[08:56:54] <danheberden> .ui-dialog-content { overflow: none; }
[08:57:09] <danheberden> thebignoise just use the progress bar in the modal - nothing special
[08:57:16] <sasori> danheberden: here's how it looks like http://s4.postimage.org/majwcie4c/jquery1.jpg i dunno how to fix it
[08:57:21] <greytrilby> anyone here handy with php arrays? (looks hopeful)
[08:57:29] <semanty> danheberden, http://dpaste.com/591375/, could you please check my code. i am not sure it use id correctly,
[08:57:39] <greytrilby> looks like a css issue to me
[08:57:51] <danheberden> sasori i'd adjust the width/height and kill overflow - looks like you got extra padding you may not want in there
[08:57:53] <semanty> danheberden, i want to make $(".to_answer[id=''+question_id+'']") work or something like that
[08:58:04] <johnline3> http://jsfiddle.net/9LVwZ/
[08:58:06] <johnline3> i am trying to make the nav pop down in the first few seconds on loading, and stay there, via a hasClass()
[08:58:38] <danheberden> semanty wat is this? $(".to_answer[id=''+question_id+'']"
[08:58:51] <danheberden> what's with the two apostrophes?
[08:59:05] <danheberden> and like i said, just $( '#' + question_id )
[08:59:16] <danheberden> none of this [id="blahblahblah"] stuff
[09:00:04] <thebignoise> danheberden: i know lol but i can get it to run correctly
[09:00:30] <thebignoise> danheberden: maybe i miss understand the capabilities of the progess bar
[09:00:42] <navaru> johnline: '#header > #nav > ol' what is that selector? that is just meesy
[09:00:54] <johnline3> i know :<
[09:01:01] <semanty> danheberden, here i do not use id to postion, i want to use a .answer with id attribute is question_id
[09:01:02] <thebignoise> does it actually show the progress of something or is it more of a sudo type thing?
[09:01:21] <danheberden> semanty you understand ID's are unique, right?
[09:01:27] <semanty> danheberden, suppose it is not an id, just something other one like name
[09:01:35] <danheberden> ok
[09:01:49] <danheberden> you will have to fix your erroneous apostrophes tho
[09:01:51] <semanty> danheberden, yes, i do know that, i just use it very randomly, not a good habit
[09:02:04] <johnline3> i most of all dont understand the structure of functions, if and else statements
[09:02:24] <danheberden> $( '.to_answer[name="' + question_name + '"]' )
[09:02:27] <semanty> $(".to_answer[name=''+question_anme]")?
[09:02:28] <danheberden> semanty ^
[09:02:44] <danheberden> yeah, you see the ' ' in yours? that's gonna not parse right
[09:02:46] <bjornjohansson> http://jsfiddle.net/RzJcZ/ <-- how come the script doesn't create any link for me when I run it?
[09:02:59] <Heliodor> How do i reference a variable in a selector??
[09:03:16] <danheberden> Heliodor see my answer to semanty
[09:03:31] <danheberden> question_name is a variable in that example
[09:03:58] <greytrilby> heliodor $("#myselector"+myvariable)
[09:04:24] <Heliodor> danheberden: thanks!!
[09:04:50] <greytrilby> or $("#firstpartofselector"+myvariable+"secondpartofselector")
[09:04:58] <danheberden> bjornjohansson http://jsfiddle.net/RzJcZ/1/
[09:05:02] <danheberden> you can't add html like that
[09:05:06] <danheberden> you have to add NODES, not just tags
[09:05:21] <danheberden> the dom doesn't think in terms of adding start/end tags - that's just HTML before it's parsed
[09:05:42] <danheberden> the dom things of things as, well, things - nodes. so create your <a> element in its entirety, THEN append
[09:06:11] <bjornjohansson> danheberden: I want to have the </a>-tag in another append...
[09:06:24] <danheberden> bjornjohansson the dom don't work that way kiddo :)
[09:06:25] <bjornjohansson> because I need to create some elements between <a> and </a>
[09:06:34] <danheberden> bjornjohansson no problem
[09:06:42] <danheberden> bjornjohansson create your a, then append your shit into THAT a
[09:06:51] <danheberden> then append that a into your container or whatevs
[09:07:12] <danheberden> like first create your stocking, stuff your presents in it, and then hang it on the mantle  - ya dig?
[09:07:47] <geekbuntu> danheberden, christmas in august?
[09:07:50] <geekbuntu> :-D
[09:07:55] <danheberden> HELLLLLS yes
[09:08:01] <geekbuntu> woohoo
[09:08:10] <geekbuntu> i asked for a centerfold
[09:08:20] <danheberden> and all you got was a lousy magazine?
[09:08:21] * geekbuntu runs downstairs to see if it's for reals
[09:08:35] <geekbuntu> i'll take the magazine
[09:08:37] <geekbuntu> o.0
[09:08:42] <danheberden> annnnnnyway
[09:08:58] <geekbuntu> has anyone added any animation to tmpl?
[09:09:10] <geekbuntu> seems once the render is executed it fires like a canon
[09:11:19] <bjornjohansson> danheberden: hm, no not really "digging" :P
[09:11:39] <danheberden> you can opt to just get the rendered content and do as ye please, geekbuntu
[09:12:07] <Heliodor> how use the selector to select an element with a specific value, for example data="1"
[09:12:26] <Heliodor> how do i use the selector to select an element with a specific value, for example data="1"?
[09:14:43] <danheberden> bjornjohansson http://jsfiddle.net/RzJcZ/2/
[09:15:05] <geekbuntu> danheberden, thanks - will play with that idea - just writing a function to 'hopefully' execute during/after render

[09:16:29] <siovene> Hello! I'm writing a jquery-ui plugin and would like to use some 3rd party JS for some generic funciton it provides; I don't want to force the user of my jquery-ui widget to have to remember to include that JS file. How can I include it from within my jquery .js file?
[09:17:19] <danheberden> put that code in your js file
[09:17:53] <siovene> danheberden: that's not the most maintainable approach. I don't want to copy/paste and have to maintain patches for the external module.
[09:18:11] <danheberden> use a git submodule to import the latest form the other lib
[09:18:18] <danheberden> *from
[09:18:38] <danheberden> make a simple build script to deploy your final and minified versions
[09:18:39] <siovene> yeah, but then it means that it's not really in the same file as my jquery code.
[09:18:49] <siovene> Ah.
[09:19:00] <danheberden> just - like, having some remote request seems dangerous
[09:19:15] <siovene> Yeah no, this would be local anyway.
[09:19:18] <danheberden> what if the url stops working? what if your users of the plugin don't WANT that other http request?
[09:19:22] <siovene> I just want to avoid copypasting.
[09:19:40] <siovene> I'm ok to copying the file as a whole, but not with copy pasting into my code.
[09:19:41] <danheberden> so if you're gonna make them add the file, you're gonna make them have to specify the path in your plugin
[09:19:51] <zoned> im calling a page with a url parameter.. index.php?code=144SC44M27H ... how do i "GET" this code from within jquery?
[09:20:12] <siovene> danheberden: I don't want the users to download the file. I will distribute it with my plugin.
[09:20:36] <danheberden> zoned - location.search
[09:20:44] <danheberden> more specifically, window.location.search
[09:20:59] <danheberden> it's also in the location.href
[09:21:24] <danheberden> siovene oh i know, but, like - what if they have a structure for that - and need to specify the path?
[09:21:41] <danheberden> like - if my js is in /files/omg/why/this/deep/whatever.js
[09:21:44] <danheberden> you don't know that
[09:21:53] <danheberden> so they have to specify it _somewhere_
[09:21:58] <danheberden> so they might as well add the bloody script tag
[09:22:18] <danheberden> or, just find a way to make concatenating the two easy for ya
[09:22:34] <danheberden> we do that with jquery - keep the files separeate for maintainability, and concatenate them all at build
[09:22:50] <danheberden> http://github.com/jquery/jquery - see the Makefile and /src folder
[09:24:33] <benji__> Hi, is there a nice way to have different plugins to run in the same page that require different version of jquery ?
[09:27:19] <danheberden> benji__ it's not at all recommended, but you can include your jquery version, and then right after do something like <script> var jQuery152 = jQuery.noConflict( true ); </script>
[09:27:46] <elb0w> doing $.post("some/url",{ this: 'that' }); is same as some/url?this=that?
[09:27:56] <danheberden> that will reset $ and jQuery to what they were before you included that version, and now you have jQuery152 to use, like jQuery152.fn.jquery will be 1.5.2, but jQuery.fn.jquery might be 1.6.2
[09:28:08] <danheberden> elb0w aye
[09:29:19] <benji__> danheberden: thanks, I'll give it a shot
[09:29:23] <swiggy> is there a timer function/event for jquery? or should i just use the normal javascript one?
[09:29:38] <danheberden> that IS the timer function for jquery
[09:29:56] <danheberden> just setTimeout - if you need interval, read: http://www.erichynds.com/javascript/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern/

[09:32:11] <bjhaid1> how do i delete elements that match say ("" ]) within a div tag
[09:33:08] <thinkt4nk> bjhaid1 > delete? within?
[09:33:12] <blackspotwiggins> bjhaid1, $("contains('("" ]'", "div")
[09:33:24] <blackspotwiggins> without syntax error that is
[09:33:42] <blackspotwiggins> :contains('match')
[09:33:45] <danheberden> just remember matching by content is shitty, and finding a way without it will murder less kittens
[09:33:56] <blackspotwiggins> that is true as well
[09:34:59] <bjhaid1> blackspotwiggins: what do i include to delete it?
[09:35:01] <semanty> danheberden, what is the problem with  $('#to_answer_'+question_pk+'')?
[09:35:08] <blackspotwiggins> bjhaid1, use your imagination
[09:35:20] <blackspotwiggins> or do i have to wipe your ass when you take a dump as well?
[09:35:25] <danheberden> semanty you don't need the +'' at the end, but nothing
[09:35:31] <thinkt4nk> hopefully not in that order
[09:35:32] <thinkt4nk> lol

[09:38:00] <semanty> danheberden, yes, i mistake made, now ok, thanks
[09:38:14] <danheberden> step 3) is it a string of html? string of spanish?
[09:38:17] <kenthree> do I just put the junk in $()?
[09:38:19] <Heliodor> How do i remotely click a link when clicking a link?
[09:38:38] <danheberden> Heliodor wat
[09:39:08] <blackspotwiggins> Heliodor, $("*").click() // boom shakalaka
[09:39:42] <Heliodor> danheberden: But that will click the selector, i need to click another selector when clicking that selector :)
[09:39:44] <kenthree> i'm trying to keep all logic client side, it's an app not a website so I'm not worried about that. and yea it's html
[09:39:59] <Heliodor> danheberden: i know it sounds wierd but i can only inject js to this site, not change it.
[09:40:12] <danheberden> so you're XSSing?
[09:40:23] <Heliodor> danheberden: No, a bookmarklet
[09:40:32] <blackspotwiggins> wtf Heliodor
[09:40:32] <danheberden> are you looking to trigger a bound event, or follow a url?
[09:40:40] <blackspotwiggins> you can change the site with js you know
[09:40:44] <Heliodor> danheberden: Trigger a bount event
[09:41:27] <Heliodor> to be more specific, im trying to trigger a selector with a matching data value :)
[09:41:43] <danheberden> then $( '#mySillyLInk[data-omg="FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUU"]' ).click( function() { $( '#thatOtherOne' ).click() } );
[09:41:58] <danheberden> of course # is unique, the data-omg was a quick afterthought
[09:42:13] <danheberden> s/#/\./ - problem solved
[09:42:28] <Heliodor> um, so data="" is invalid, it sould be data-somevalue="" ?
[09:42:39] <siovene> ff~.~ . ~.~.

[09:47:56] <zmaril> Anybody know how to get html to display within a select option element?
[09:48:25] <aaronw-1> I didn't think you really could do that

[09:51:12] <phlp> it will be escaped with &lt; and &gt;

[10:04:04] <Heliodor> When i try $("#info_thumbs a[data-id="+dataThis+"]").click(); in the console it does not work, but if i try $("#info_thumbs a[data-id=3]").click(); in the console it works. Running a javascript alert on dataThis returns 3. I just don't get it?!
[10:05:36] <Heliodor> Can it be that the variable is fetched as an object and not the number? How do i convert it?
[10:06:08] <blackspotwiggins> Heliodor, you should know by now not to debug shit using alerts
[10:07:09] <blackspotwiggins> checking whether your selector is correct would be somewhat more useful
[10:07:48] <Heliodor> :-S

[10:18:29] <jscheel> any reason why a fadeOut would not work on an absolutely positioned item, containing additional absolutely positioned items?
[10:21:39] <buddyq> wondering if someone can help with jcarousel?
[10:22:01] <Heliodor> blackspotwiggins: And how do i do that?
[10:22:06] <buddyq> I've got it working but it doesn't wrap using the wrap paramter... if you keep clicking right, it shows blanks. http://50.22.43.92/~unitedwh/
[10:22:18] <blackspotwiggins> Heliodor, srsly? you have been here for months and you dont know?
[10:22:46] <Heliodor> Um, i got back here after 1,5 years off jquery.... and i nevere knew jquery properly before that, especially not debugging.
[10:23:07] <blackspotwiggins> hardly
[10:23:30] <blackspotwiggins> if you cant/dont want to learn why should we do your work for you?
[10:24:02] <Heliodor> I just don't get why the variable returns 3 and testing it manually it clicks the proper selector, but when refering to the variable inside the selector it does not work...
[10:24:11] <Heliodor> It's not that im not trying to learn.
[10:24:20] <raiun> can somebody tell me whats wrong with my code?  my console says too much recursion sometimes, other times its not giving me an error but the browser just locks up http://pastie.org/2351298
[10:24:30] <Heliodor> Im just very slow and confused.
[10:25:29] <phlp> Heliodor: was the alert(dataThis) from the console?
[10:25:43] <donburks> raiun: It's likely complaining because you keep setting intervals. setInterval() will run every 1000 ms, you don't need to re-initialize it.
[10:25:45] <buddyq> coudl one of you take a look at the jcarousel on my page: http://50.22.43.92/~unitedwh/
[10:25:51] <Heliodor> phlp: Unfortunately yes http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=zdpYBGBw
[10:25:55] <Heliodor> phlp: that's the code
[10:26:10] <Brodingo> buddyq you havent specified a wrap
[10:26:32] <buddyq> I did though
[10:26:37] <Brodingo> you probably want either both or circular
[10:26:51] <Brodingo> at the bottom i see jQuery('#mycarousel').jcarousel();
[10:26:53] <phlp> Heliodor: try console.log("#info_thumbs a[data-id="+dataThis+"]")
[10:27:27] <buddyq> Brodingo: I want circular... but no worky when I put the wrap
[10:28:07] <Brodingo> and youre using two versions of jquery, are you reconciling those correctly?
[10:29:22] <buddyq> oh... I am?
[10:29:24] <buddyq> crap...
[10:29:25] <Heliodor> phlp: Thanks, i got a log responce using visual event to trigger the event (else i would just navigate off the page). It returned #info_thumbs a[data-id=5] so it's correct? Then why doesn't it click the selector?
[10:29:26] <buddyq> hmm....
[10:29:33] <buddyq> jQuery('ul#home-slider').jcarousel({size: 892,scroll: 4,visible: 4,auto: 0,wrap: 'circular'}); is what is in my page.
[10:29:55] <Heliodor> phlp: So i can just put console.log instead of $ to get the response in the log?
[10:30:02] <buddyq> oh yea... you're right... lemme get rid of that prettyphoto one.
[10:30:29] <Brodingo> and why is the size 892?
[10:30:36] <Brodingo> whats not the dimension its the number of items
[10:30:50] <Brodingo> hence blank placeholders
[10:31:01] <phlp> Heliodor: well that was only logging a string just to see if the selector is correct before it gets to jquery. so you have an a with data-id="5" before you were saying 3?
[10:31:16] <BillCriswell> Any way to populate a form with some data from a serializedArray() call?
[10:31:34] <Brodingo> and i see that the width is acutally 892 so i guess you were just confused buddyq
[10:31:36] <Heliodor> phlp: The id changes when i hover over a different image, so 5 is correct here, any number triggers the event
[10:31:55] <buddyq> well it still does not work with only one jquery loaded.
[10:32:17] <buddyq> Brodingo: I dont understand what you're saying?
[10:33:00] <Heliodor> phlp: If i run the click event manually in the console, it clicks the correct link and the event is launched.
[10:33:01] <Brodingo> size: 892 does not define in pixels the width of the jcarousel, it sets the number of items in the jcarousel
[10:33:05] <buddyq> oh!
[10:33:13] <buddyq> now I see.... fixed!
[10:33:17] <buddyq>  Thanks Brodingo
[10:33:18] <Heliodor> phlp: but not when using the live-click via the first link
[10:33:27] <buddyq> I was confused when I read the docs I guess.
[10:33:30] <buddyq> thanks
[10:33:33] <Heliodor> phlp: (Using the pasted script)

[10:38:23] <Heliodor> phlp: but im not supposed to runt it with console.log in the console of firebug right? :-S
[10:39:17] <phlp> you cant just replace $ with console.log. that's not what i was saying before. the code i pasted logged only the selector (just a string)
[10:39:43] <Jpec07> .slideUp() issue - http://jsfiddle.net/Jpec07/yCbNW/ - anyone care to help?
[10:40:56] <Heliodor> phlp: Ok, thanks for clearing that out.
[10:41:32] <Brodingo> Jpec07 what are you trying to do exactly?
[10:41:48] <phlp> Heliodor: replace the .click() line with console.log($("#info_thumbs a[data-id="+dataThis+"]").length)
[10:42:43] <Jpec07> Brodingo: problem I'm encountering has to do with the .stop() - I'm trying to make it so that clicking the link again mid-animation will trigger the next animation. Only problem is that on the next click, the height is defined where the .stop() had happened
[10:42:59] <Jpec07> so a chunk of the div's content is cut off
[10:43:12] <Heliodor> phlp: it returns 1
[10:43:34] <Brodingo> .stop(true,true)
[10:43:43] <Heliodor> phlp: that means it exists right?
[10:44:32] <Brodingo> Jpec07 or http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/yCbNW/10/
[10:44:34] <phlp> Heliodor: yes so it should work
[10:44:43] <Heliodor> phlp: So it's not just me then....
[10:45:04] <Heliodor> phlp: I'll try it with an older jquery version
[10:45:47] <Jpec07> Problem with .stop(true,true) is that it throws the animation to the end, which produces some...interesting results, depending on which browser you're running, and where in the animation you stop it.
[10:46:17] <Heliodor> phlp: Same with 1.4.4, nothing happens.
[10:46:52] <Jpec07> and slideToggle(), while simpler, doesn't get rid of queued animation: clicking that link twenty times will still yield 20 animations
[10:47:26] <phlp> Heliodor: do this console.log($("#info_thumbs a[data-id="+dataThis+"]").data('events').click);
[10:49:14] <Heliodor> phlp: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=72Jh2SUk
[10:49:37] <Jpec07> gimme a sec, brodingo, gonna try running it with .animate() and see if it gives the same problem
[10:49:53] <phlp> Heliodor: so what makes you think the click isn't happening? what is supposed to happen?
[10:53:30] <Heliodor> phlp: This is the code for the button that is clicked. http://pastebin.com/mBneT5GY
[10:55:42] <Jpec07> Brodingo: http://jsfiddle.net/Jpec07/VjRY8/ - same issue with .animate(). Is .stop(true,true) my only option? Can't define the height of the Div, because the content is dynamic...
[10:56:06] <Heliodor> phlp: Couldnt find any other way to trigger a shadowbox gallery by clicking on another image. You see, i have thumbnails in a  picturegallery, when i hover over them, the large image is displayed in another div and when i click the large image, the gallery should open the correct image. That's why i need the click event.

[11:02:58] <Jpec07> http://jsfiddle.net/Jpec07/rseRa/ - .slide*() and .stop() trouble, 'cause I'm not sure if Brodingo's still around. :/
[11:03:51] <Brodingo> http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/yCbNW/13/
[11:04:17] <Brodingo> a bit smoother animating them manually
[11:04:42] <Brodingo> but requires a little more coding to be extensible and act how youd like
[11:05:05] <Brodingo> one might just slideToggle() and call it a day

[11:48:32] <kborchers> cam seriously? read the docs http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[11:49:40] <Heliodor> phlp: I solved it :)
[11:49:53] <cam> i am abusing you trust, sorry i will read more
[11:50:39] <kborchers> cam: look under options at collapsible and active
[11:55:22] <anoob> are there any automatic way to get all element values from a form and use it with the ajax function (data parameter)
[11:55:22] <anoob> ?
[11:55:39] <kborchers> ?serialize @ anoob
[11:55:40] <bot-t1> anoob, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[11:56:42] <raiun> how can you clearInterval from within the interval?
[11:57:01] <raiun> because i need to clear it on a condition thats being checked inside the function that the interval is running
[11:57:37] <donburks> raiun: You had it set to var t=setInterval(stuff,time);. Just do clearInterval(t) and then refire it when you need to.
[11:58:25] <raiun> donburks: i get t is not defined
[11:58:53] <donburks> Scope.
[11:58:56] <raiun> im clearing the interval inside of the function the interval runs
[11:59:16] <donburks> Do you define t inside that function?
[11:59:20] <raiun> because i only want to clear the interval conditionally
[11:59:21] <raiun> no
[11:59:32] <donburks> Then you'll need to pass t to that function.
[12:00:02] <cam> okok
[12:00:52] <raiun> donburks: now im getting 	useless setInterval call (missing quotes around argument?)
[12:00:56] <elrioter> hi
[12:01:10] <raiun> t = setInterval(countdown(t), 1000);
[12:01:41] <donburks> :|
[12:02:03] <bstakes> raiun that syntax is invoking countdown right away
[12:02:13] <elrioter> How can I make that this: $('#left-sidebar-helper').click(function() { $('#sidebar').animate({ left: '-220'});  }); the next time it's clicked will return to it's original position?
[12:02:15] <raiun> before t is set i know
[12:02:16] <raiun> but
[12:02:23] <raiun> i dont get how u can pass t in then?
[12:02:43] <bstakes> your first arg can be an anonymous function
[12:02:57] <raiun> im kinda new to javascript, whats that mean? or how is that used?
[12:03:22] <bstakes> t = setInterval(function() {countdown(t);},1000);
[12:03:32] <raiun> and that would work the same?
[12:03:50] <bstakes> yeah, functions are first class in javascript, so you can pass them as arguments
[12:03:54] <phlp> t = setInterval(countdown, 1000, t);
[12:04:26] <elb0w> how do I exit from a $(".afafaf").each(function() { })?
[12:04:36] <phlp> return false;
[12:04:44] <elb0w> thats it?
[12:04:55] <elrioter> Should I set a jsfiddle?
[12:05:02] <radiantstatic> I'm looking for a jquery/html5 audio player. anyone have any suggestions?
[12:05:13] <ceej> is there a way to get the current background color of an element even if it's set by a class and not inline?
[12:05:55] <kborchers> ?css @ ceej
[12:06:06] <ceej> it's not picking it up
[12:06:18] <elb0w> how are you trying to get it?
[12:06:43] <ceej> https://gist.github.com/482fa6b074dc3c917e61
[12:06:43] <davemo> radiantstatic: jwplayer, jplayer, popcorn.js
[12:07:16] <radiantstatic> davemo: thanks
[12:09:05] <ceej> the only why I can think of doing it is like $('.even:first').css('background-color');
[12:09:37] <blackspotwiggins> ceej, you could try parsing cssText & friends yourself
[12:09:39] <ceej> because .css doesn't get the current background color, only the css directly applied to that element and nothing from an inherent classes
[12:10:01] <blackspotwiggins> but it probably does not have more information than what jquery gives you
[12:10:16] <blackspotwiggins> ah, inheritance
[12:10:26] <blackspotwiggins> you are out of luck there im afraid
[12:11:01] <phlp> ceej: are you using the color plugin?
[12:11:13] <ceej> ye I am...
[12:12:56] <phlp> ceej: so what does the .css return? transparent?
[12:13:03] <ceej> phlp: yeep
[12:13:18] <phlp> sure it's not a parent that has the background-color?
[12:14:37] <ceej> o wait I think it's actually selecting the child element.. good call need to do closest('tr')
[12:14:45] <ceej> thank you
[12:15:22] <elrioter> Ok, i've set up a fiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/yWxpY/ i'm trying to make that the second time you click on the button, the sidebar returns to it's original position
[12:15:39] <ceej> hmmm still does transparent
[12:16:05] <ceej> phlp: http://screencast.com/t/WSLyQStRy
[12:18:05] <AfroTurf> i have a radio input and i'm accessing it by [name=enrolled] and jquery just can't seem to find it. it doesn't return an object?
[12:19:45] <ajpiano> AfroTurf:  put quotes around the attribute value
[12:20:20] <AfroTurf> name='enrolled' ?
[12:20:23] <ajpiano> yep
[12:20:33] <AfroTurf> ah ok has this changed in 1.6
[12:21:23] <ajpiano> i think in 1.5 actually
[12:22:46] <AfroTurf> hmm my event still doesn't seem to fire.. but it does do it on jsfiddle
[12:25:53] <AfroTurf> i got it thanks!
[12:27:09] <Taggnostr2> can someone help me out understanding this example: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#categories ?
[12:27:57] <Taggnostr2> I want to avoid repeating 'category: "..."' for each entry, but I'm not sure where those data go
[12:29:33] <Taggnostr2> if I make an object like {"catname": [{...}, {...}],  "othercat": [{...}, {...}]}, will the $.each in the $.widget block iterate on those?
[12:36:36] <quizme> Using jQuery whats the most efficient selector to find the first div on a web page
[12:37:37] <kborchers> quizme: $("div:first")
[12:38:14] <quizme> kborchers is that the most efficient way?
[12:39:51] <kborchers> i guess it would depend on the structure of your page and what you know about it at the time of the search. obviously, the most efficient way would be $("#divID") if you know the div's id. or if you know where the div is, selecting down as deep as you can is always best
[12:40:11] <Guest> Hello together! Ive got an very important question.
[12:40:42] <Brodingo> well you better not delay in asking it
[12:41:02] <kborchers> the answer is 42
[12:41:07] <Guest> OK. Could you please freenode me?
[12:41:29] <kborchers> wtf? not when we just met!
[12:41:40] <kborchers> ;)
[12:42:13] <elrioter> anyone got a minute?
[12:42:18] <Brodingo> so many minutes
[12:42:28] <Guest> It is very important. I need freenoding to connect me with the internet.
[12:42:43] <elrioter> lol
[12:42:56] <Brodingo> wat
[12:43:16] <elrioter> im trying to make this http://jsfiddle.net/yWxpY/ to work
[12:43:24] <elrioter> but I don't know why the second click isn't animating
[12:43:36] <elrioter> or if there's a shorter way
[12:43:49] <Guest> PLEASE FREENODE ME!!!
[12:43:49] <bstakes> @quizme $('div').eq(0) might be more efficient, you could run a jsperf to see
[12:43:50] <Brodingo> the second click is animating to the value it is already at
[12:43:55] <fetherston> quizme: $("html div:first-child") if you don't know the ID
[12:43:55] <Brodingo> hence no movement
[12:44:29] <elrioter> Brodingo: how's that?
[12:45:00] <Brodingo> when you click it animates to left: -160
[12:45:21] <Brodingo> and when you click it again it tries to animate to left: -160, which it is already at
[12:45:24] <elrioter_> Please freenode me!!!
[12:45:45] <Brodingo> wtf
[12:45:59] <Brodingo> you are on freenode
[12:46:05] <kborchers> fetherston: why would you specify html? obviously it will start its search there and first-child will give the first child element of every div on the page
[12:46:07] <elrioter> i didn't type that
[12:46:11] <radiantstatic> Has anyone ever tried: http://www.codebasehero.com/2011/07/html5-music-player-updated/ - I'd love to use it, but its not even working in the demo provided in the download.
[12:46:12] <elrioter> that's really weird
[12:46:17] <Brodingo> i know
[12:46:20] <elrioter_> Brodingo: No, Im not.
[12:46:24] <Brodingo> Guest just poached your nick
[12:46:43] <Brodingo> you are on freenode right now, in the #jquery channel
[12:46:44] <elmister> this is really weird
[12:46:59] <elmister> i'm not typing that stuff
[12:47:03] <elrioter_> But Im not connected with the internet.
[12:47:04] <fetherston> kborchers: right, that actually wouldn't work, just trying to think of a way to do it without the div's ID
[12:47:16] <Brodingo> what the fuck elrioter_
[12:47:33] <elmister> I changed my name to elmister
[12:47:41] <elmister> I don't know who the hell is elrioter_
[12:47:56] <Brodingo> he trollin/doesnt know how the internet works
[12:48:03] <elmister> lol
[12:48:11] <elmister> Ok, let's pick up where we left
[12:48:12] <Brodingo> anyway
[12:48:27] <Brodingo> are you wanting to toggle back and forth like a little control panel?
[12:48:31] <elrioter_> Brodingo: What the fuck is going on with you bumfucker? Couldnt you understand me???
[12:48:36] <elmister> exactly
[12:49:17] <tbranyen> wat
[12:49:46] <Brodingo> well well
[12:50:03] <Brodingo> ?toggle @ elmister
[12:50:04] <bot-t> elmister, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[12:50:08] <elrioter_> Please freenode me!!!
[12:50:33] <elmister> I was reading that, but didn't quite get it
[12:50:43] <elrioter_> I havent any connection to the internet!
[12:50:46] <elmister> Could you hook me up with an example based on my fiddle
[12:50:50] <Brodingo> basically its like a click handler but you can pass it 2+ functions
[12:51:02] <miketaylr> PEACE
[12:51:03] <Brodingo> yeah one sec elmister
[12:51:16] <Brodingo> ty ajpiano
[12:51:23] <miketaylr> dude just got freenoded
[12:51:31] <vladikoff> noden't
[12:51:36] <Brodingo> lol
[12:51:39] <Brodingo> JUST FREENODE ME
[12:51:42] <Brodingo> FUCK
[12:51:58] <elmister> Brodingo: awesome, thanks
[12:53:00] <Brodingo> elmister http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/yWxpY/1/
[12:54:40] <elmister> Brodingo: Thanks! I think i understand it
[12:54:50] <elmister> after the first function, I have to put the other
[12:55:18] <kborchers> ajpiano: could i pm you a link to my site cuz i need help but don't want anyone to see my codez and then could you freenode me ;)
[12:55:27] <ajpiano> hahah
[12:55:38] <atriv> Hi, looking for a bit of help... I can't figure out why these DOM elements are getting appended out of order -> http://jsfiddle.net/TvrUQ/
[12:55:45] <Brodingo> FREEEENODDDEEEE MEEEEEEEEEEE
[12:56:00] <atriv> its a nested for-loop. and the </tr> tag is getting appended before the nested loop
[12:56:24] <Brodingo> atriv you cant do dom fragments like that
[12:56:25] <ajpiano> atriv: that's not how you do appending
[12:56:32] <ajpiano> Brodingo: i'll let you handle this ;)
[12:56:55] <atriv> Hmm, ok. Is there a simple alternative solution?
[12:57:02] <Brodingo> ?wrap
[12:57:03] <bot-t> .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[12:57:14] <atriv> thanks!
[12:57:15] <dabear> ajpiano: you are so lazy
[12:57:22] <Brodingo> and i would consider .each() for looping like that
[12:57:23] <phlp> atriv: http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/03/43439-reasons-to-use-append-correctly
[12:57:24] <Brodingo> ?each
[12:57:25] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[12:57:33] <elmister> brb
[12:57:33] <ajpiano> atriv: the important thing to know is that in javascript you append Elements, not strings
[12:57:37] <ajpiano> so you ahve to have an entire "tr" built
[12:57:51] <ajpiano> you don't like, append a opening tr string, then add some more stuff, and then append a closing tr string
[12:58:03] <atriv> I see... makes sense.
[12:58:06] <ajpiano> ok:)
[12:59:22] <jeffsmykil> is there a good way to chain events like an append and a fadeIn?
[13:00:06] <jeffsmykil> oh duh
[13:00:07] <jeffsmykil> hide it
[13:00:10] <jeffsmykil> then show it
[13:00:40] <dabear> .hide().show()
[13:00:52] <Brodingo> .hug().tickle()
[13:01:13] <Brodingo> .synergize() // NO NEED TO FUCKIN CHAIN THAT SHIT
[13:01:16] <dabear> they use the same queue, so shouldn't happen in paralell
[13:04:55] <jaequery> hi
[13:05:42] <jaequery> hola
[13:06:02] <Brodingo> sup jaequery
[13:06:10] <jaequery> im trying to validate a input box
[13:06:33] <Brodingo> woah cool
[13:06:47] <jaequery> i can detect if input box is empty or not by just doing if($('#input').val() == ''))
[13:07:07] <jaequery> but i also want it so that it'll detect it as empty even if user just input spaces inside it
[13:07:23] <jaequery> and im having a brain fart
[13:07:31] <Brodingo> use ===
[13:07:46] <phlp> jaequery: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.trim
[13:08:00] <jaequery> ah trim, thanks
[13:10:53] <necromancer> would jQuery kill me if i added a custom property to the jQuery object in my plugin?
[13:11:12] <necromancer> like say i have a plugin that uses another object to do all the heavy lifting
[13:11:16] <necromancer> (a regular JS object)
[13:11:29] <JQUERYQ4U> is there a way to post to a page like a normal submit?  Without having to setup a form and whatnot and submit it?
[13:11:30] <necromancer> i want to make the methods in that object available when calling the plugin directly
[13:11:47] <ajpiano> necromancer: so store the instance in data....
[13:11:47] <necromancer> JQUERYQ4U: look up $.ajax and $.post
[13:12:04] <necromancer> ajpiano: yeah i've been doing that but it requires me to create a var every time i want to access it
[13:12:11] <ajpiano> it doesn't
[13:12:13] <JQUERYQ4U> necromancer: don't they just return a response (data) instead of redirect?
[13:12:18] <ajpiano> $("#foo").data("bar").baz();
[13:12:25] <JQUERYQ4U> *redirecting to the content.
[13:12:32] <necromancer> ajpiano: oh wow
[13:12:41] <necromancer> ajpiano: didn't know i could do that, but of course it makes sense now
[13:13:26] <ajpiano> necromancer: same as like you can do var foo = "a b c d", baz = foo.split(" "), bang = foo.join("-") or just... "a b c d".split(" ").join("-");
[13:13:56] <ajpiano> well, baz join :p
[13:14:00] <zoned> i know this is in jquery.. but i'm wondering if anyone knows how can i show the server/host name of a mysql db? i keep getting access denied error and i'm wondering if maybe 'localhost' isn't the right hostname?
[13:14:15] <ajpiano> zoned: this just straight up is not the right venue for that question
[13:14:33] <zoned> yeah, nobody who uses jquery has ever used mysql before
[13:14:52] <Brodingo> classy
[13:15:08] <necromancer> zoned: you shouldn't be talking to a DB from the client side.
[13:15:15] <zoned> ajax?
[13:15:21] <necromancer> lol
[13:15:23] <bstakes> what's a mysql
[13:15:36] <zoned> can someone point me to the right channel? i tried #mysql...
[13:15:45] <necromancer> zoned: well what backend are you using?
[13:15:49] <zoned> i've honestly never joined another channel, lol.
[13:16:06] <bstakes> $('mysql').attr('localhost')?
[13:16:09] <zoned> php/mysql
[13:16:12] <kborchers> ##php
[13:16:13] <necromancer> ##php is what you ant
[13:16:14] <necromancer> want*
[13:16:28] <necromancer> bstakes: $('mysql').data('localhost')
[13:16:33] <necromancer> bstakes: we use html5 now sir
[13:16:53] <bstakes> noted
[13:17:01] <jeffsmykil> "we" meaning people not doing production work
[13:17:47] <Brodingo> $('SELECT * FROM node as n where n.nid = LOL FUCK')
[13:18:16] <zoned> #php is invite only
[13:18:21] <zoned> #mysql i can't type anything
[13:18:21] <kborchers> ##php
[13:18:30] <zoned> on freenode?
[13:18:45] <kborchers> yep
[13:18:53] <ajpiano> you have to be registerd to join ##php iirc
[13:19:08] <zoned> how do i register?
[13:19:15] <FLeiXiuS``> Is there a way to append to the URL location bar?
[13:19:16] <jeffsmykil> rofl #php is invite only
[13:19:17] <jeffsmykil> thats a club im clamoring to join
[13:19:28] <zoned> hhahaha
[13:19:38] <Sean-Der> "button[name='phone" + i + "']"
[13:19:43] <ajpiano> zoned: /msg chanserv help
[13:19:47] <zoned> fleixius`` i think it's location.href ?
[13:19:47] <Sean-Der> Is that correct if i = 1?
[13:19:51] <ajpiano> zoned, actually, /msg nickserv help
[13:20:54] <jeffsmykil> does .delay accept a time parameter?
[13:21:03] <Brodingo> yes
[13:21:13] <Brodingo> but it is used only for delaying animation queue
[13:35:08] <braddunbar> IE7, using html5shim: /* works */ jQuery('<time></time>').html('foo');  /* doesn't */ jQuery('<div><time></time></div>').find('time').html('foo');
[13:35:14] <braddunbar> Any takers?
[13:37:01] <snover> braddunbar: html5 is impossible in dynamic code in IE, dont even try.
[13:37:59] <bfred> any better way to use the dom-ready event as a deferred than this one? $.Deferred(function( deferred ){$( deferred.resolve );}),
[13:38:19] <bfred> read it as "on dom ready, resolve this deferred"
[13:38:48] <braddunbar> snover: Huh...that's not good.
[13:39:23] <braddunbar> There are just tons of bugs, or is there a specific reason?
[13:39:54] <chubicle> hey i know you guys are going to hate me for bringing up ext js here, but the extjs channel was so crappy. so i'm comparing two panels, one in ext js and one in jquery. im using jsperf to test them both. i run the test in firefox and chrome with no problems. now i'm tryin to run it in internet explorer 9. it works fine testing the jquery panel, but it implodes when it tries to test the ext js one. can anyone help me?  http://jsperf.
[13:40:35] <chubicle> i tried checking for extra commas but i couldn't find any after staring at this code for 10minutes
[13:41:32] <snover> I dont think this is the jQuery and extjs too if that channel sucks channel
[13:41:55] <monokrome> chubicle: Everyone here could help you, but I don't think "Stop using ExtJS" is the answer that you're looking for.
[13:43:10] <chubicle> snover: hey i been stumped on this problem for a while, so i thought i'd run it by here cause i know jquery has a nice community
[13:43:16] <jaequery> whats the difference between $('.something').live('click',....)  and $('body').delegate('.something', 'click', ...)  performance wise?
[13:43:28] <chubicle> monokrome: thanks, yeah i know im just testing the two frameworks
[13:43:39] <Sean-Der> (("input.finalPriceNrc","input.finalPriceMrc"), "blur", function(){
[13:43:50] <Sean-Der> is that selector correct for getting two inputs?
[13:43:52] <snover> jaequery: The former performs a useless and stupid query for all .somethings
[13:44:05] <snover> the latter performs a useless and stupid shortcut to return document.body (just use document.body!)
[13:44:09] <Sean-Der> I can't seem to get it working right with IE8 so I am not gonig to use wildcards anymore
[13:44:43] <jaequery> snover: $('document.body').delegate('.something', 'click', ...)  like this?
[13:44:57] <cobexer> Sean-Der: $("input.finalPriceNrc, input.finalPriceMrc")
[13:45:04] <snover> jaequery: no. not like that. close, though!
[13:45:11] <bstakes> sean-der - comma inside the quotes
[13:45:12] <monokrome> jaequery: If I recall, the second one acts like: $('body', '.something').live
[13:45:41] <jaequery> but performance wise, arent they both the same?
[13:45:45] <jaequery> because they both bubble up to body
[13:45:46] <monokrome> Er, actually $('.something', 'body').live
[13:46:10] <monokrome> jaequery: Sure, but why are you using body?...
[13:46:25] <jaequery> because i have future dom elements being appended to body
[13:47:09] <monokrome> And why are you appending to body? :/
[13:47:33] <jaequery> well i can append to #body which is my div inside body
[13:47:45] <jaequery> but, theoretically, i'm assuming they are going to be both the same performance wise
[13:48:00] <monokrome> Can you make a separate container that only contains the new elements and use that?
[13:48:01] <jaequery> right?
[13:48:06] <braddunbar> snover: So the fix for this bug (http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6485) will not fix the html5 append issues?
[13:48:09] <monokrome> instead of searching the entire tree for body?
[13:48:20] <jaequery> no because i have server generated code too that i need to detect as well
[13:48:31] <snover> braddunbar: see the last comment on that ticket.
[13:48:33] <jaequery> which can be all over the place
[13:48:35] * monokrome explodes
[13:49:18] <jaequery> like .name, for instance,  it can be on #header, #profile, #bla, etc ..
[13:49:59] <jaequery> lets say, im just trying to do a miniuser profile tip on hover, where theres a link with a user name
[13:50:07] <jaequery> with class .name
[13:50:26] <jaequery> is there still ways i can do to make it optimized rather than just going up the body?
[13:51:20] <monokrome> jaequery: Like I suggested, create contains for them which don't need to be searched for. If you decide to use document.body instead, remember to do $(document.body) without strings. Otherwise you're looking for a document element with the body class, which is what you did earlier...
[13:51:40] <monokrome> s/create contains/create an element that contains/
[13:53:22] <Sean-Der> Yea I was using too many quotes thank you for the help!
[13:56:30] <elmister> Brodingo: Thanks again, it worked perfect :)
[13:56:37] <Brodingo> cheers mate
[13:56:51] <jaequery> monokrome, and,   $('.something', document.body).live(...) the same?
[13:57:18] <monokrome> jaequery: I believe so, but I won't provide a guarantee on that.
[13:57:23] <monokrome> I just use delegate.
[13:58:14] <braddunbar> snover: I'm sorry, I read the transcript and I'm still not sure of the status of that bug.
[13:59:05] <jaequery> how does live/delegate work with future events? is it like on a setinterval rechecking the dom constantly?
[13:59:24] <jaequery> it would be nice if i understood that once and for all
[13:59:24] <Brodingo> it binds to a parent and checks the target of the event
[13:59:43] <jaequery> future *elements
[13:59:50] <Brodingo> its not polling or anything
[14:00:17] <monokrome> Does anyone know how to do cross-domain AJAX without a proxy?
[14:00:20] <jaequery> but its gotta scan the entire dom though no?
[14:00:21] <Brodingo> there are some subtle differences, live performs an inital selection or something
[14:00:26] <Brodingo> but basically jsut use delegate
[14:00:41] <monokrome> (aside from JSONP)
[14:00:42] <Brodingo> like i said, you bind it to a parent element that will be there
[14:00:50] <jaequery> monokrome: i used CORS and flxhr as fallover
[14:00:54] <jaequery> works great
[14:01:03] <snover> braddunbar: unresolvable.
[14:01:04] <Brodingo> and any future elements get matched when it checks the target of the event
[14:01:12] <monokrome> flash != ajax
[14:01:22] <monokrome> I guess it works though :/
[14:01:39] <jaequery> its why i said as a failover
[14:01:44] <jaequery> but use CORS
[14:01:58] <jaequery> its really fast
[14:02:00] <monokrome> CORS?
[14:02:10] <jaequery> ya, html5
[14:02:16] <monokrome> ah, found it
[14:08:36] <monokrome> jaequery: Do you know of any jQuery plugins that do this?
[14:09:01] <monokrome> (implement the flash fallback)
[14:12:58] <braddunbar> snover: I suppose html5 will have to wait a bit longer.  Thank you for the info!
[14:15:28] <jellosea> how do i get jquery to allow me to make crosssite scripting?
[14:15:32] <aaroninfidel> can someone help me with a JS problem? I can't seem to figure out how to map this properly. http://jsbin.com/uputex/3/edit#javascript,live
[14:15:40] <jellosea> just adding crossDomain: true doesnt' seem to work
[14:17:08] <monokrome> Wait, does jQuery use CORS?
[14:17:27] <jaequery> yes the new version
[14:17:30] <jellosea> i think you have to add some setting to allow it?
[14:17:40] <jaequery> i was on 1.4 so i had to do my own mini-version of it
[14:18:11] <jaequery> enableCors: true i think it was
[14:18:15] <jaequery> on .ajax
[14:18:44] <jellosea> not just crossDomain: true?
[14:19:01] <jellosea> that feature isnt docuented
[14:19:04] <jellosea> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jQuery-ajax-settings
[14:19:16] <jaequery> ok it is crossDomain:true nvm
[14:19:39] <monokrome> Oh, awesome.
[14:19:50] <jellosea> jaequery: that doesnt seem to work tough
[14:19:50] <jaequery> just make sure to send out header Access-Control-Allow-Headers: x-requested-with
[14:19:56] <jellosea> oh yeah
[14:19:58] <jaequery> on the serveer end
[14:20:38] <jellosea> on the server end?
[14:20:48] <jellosea> i see
[14:20:51] <jellosea> what about from the client side
[14:20:53] <jellosea> the request
[14:21:35] <monokrome> The headers seem to be a confusing part. Is that so that your API can accept and deny specific requests?
[14:22:20] <jaequery> yea without it, you cant do cross domain calls to it
[14:22:27] <BillCriswell> ajpiano: Didn't you do some slide show thing about people who wants to make variables located inside an ajax success callback a global var?
[14:22:28] <monokrome> interesting
[14:23:01] <monokrome> BillCriswell: Assign their value to a global var...
[14:23:48] <ajpiano> i do
[14:24:05] <BillCriswell> ajpiano: May I have that link? Google is failing me.
[14:25:09] <ajpiano> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[14:28:00] <jellosea> jaequery: is it access-control-allow-headers or access-control-request-headers?
[14:28:02] <monokrome> That slideshow is way too sensitive with gestures :o
[14:28:50] <kenthree> does $('<img src="foo.jpg">') get loaded by the browser even if it's not appended to the DOM?
[14:29:05] <jellosea> jaequery: it still doesn't work even though i set the header
[14:29:13] <jaequery> ok let me check how i did it
[14:29:28] <jellosea> jaequery: thanks
[14:29:29] <jaequery> i ran into some issues too initially
[14:31:56] <BillCriswell> ajpiano: Thanks dude.
[14:32:00] <ajpiano> np
[14:34:59] <Fernando_R> I'm trying google ecommerce analytics module. I tried running it on $.ajax success response. No errors messages, but it doesn't works too.. Do you know how to debug it?
[14:39:06] <jellosea> jaequery: did you figure out what i have to do?
[14:41:16] <orplac> is there anyway to time how long a setTimeout takes, beyond just intercepting the given number of milliseconds before command execution (for qUnit testing purposes)?
[14:45:32] <Blazento> anyone know of a plugin that manages sorting hierarchical data?
[14:48:00] <jellosea> does anyone know how to get CORS working in jquery?
[14:50:34] <muay-guy> hello guys, how can I assign a value to a hidden input tag?
[14:55:59] <muay-guy> hey, anyone knows how to assign a value to a hiddent input?
[14:56:18] <dabear> muay-guy: why are you explicitly askin for how to do it on _hidden_ input tags?
[14:56:38] <dabear> the process is identical to do how you do it on non-hidden inputs
[14:57:19] <muay-guy> $("#input-id").val(var); ?
[14:57:34] <jkline> muay-guy: yeah, the visibility does not change how you assign to it
[14:59:33] <muay-guy> ok I'll just try it
[15:00:19] <toastyghost> that is the right syntax muay-guy
[15:00:52] <dabear> muay-guy: why didn't you ?tias it before asking?
[15:00:59] <dabear> ?tias @muay-guy
[15:01:00] <bot-t> muay-guy, Try It And See
[15:01:34] <muay-guy> dabear: I had previously tried without success, probably because I had missed something
[15:01:51] <muay-guy> didn't mean to come off as annoying
[15:03:58] <jellosea> does anyone know how to get CORS working in jquery?
[15:09:20] <muay-guy> dabear: I do am having some problems though, when I check what's the value set in the hidden input I find this "[object Object]"
[15:09:27] <madprops> how can I turn this to grab videos from vimeo.com as well? var $allVideos = $("#post_holder iframe[src^='http://www.youtube.com']"),
[15:09:28] <muay-guy> where there should be an int
[15:13:21] <Taggnostr2> http://jsfiddle.net/6qrv8/ works, but http://jsfiddle.net/6qrv8/1/ doesn't, can anyone help me figure out what's the problem?
[15:14:28] <Taggnostr2> in the first link data is an array, and in the second link I changed it to be an object, changing the _renderMenu accordingly
[15:14:51] <jellosea> does anyone know how to get CORS working in jquery?
[15:14:54] <Taggnostr2> but when I changed it the _rendrMenu function doesn't even seem to be called
[15:19:48] <Ogredude> why am I getting "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'toString' of undefined" when I try to $("selector").checked.toString() ?
[15:19:55] <Ogredude> doesn't the .checked method return a boolean?
[15:20:39] <Taggnostr2> maybe that object doesn't have a checked attribute
[15:20:58] <Ogredude> it's a checkbox
[15:21:05] <Ogredude> I hope it has a checked attribute
[15:21:23] <Ogredude> either that or the selector's not keying on the right element
[15:21:24] <Taggnostr2> are you sure that selector picks the right object?
[15:22:20] <Ogredude> ah, it gets the right object but it gives it to me in an array
[15:22:31] <Ogredude> so I just need to $("selector")[0].checked
[15:23:03] <Ogredude> yeah that worked
[15:24:52] <kenthree> where's the documentation for ownerDocument?
[15:24:56] <kenthree> or explanation
[15:25:30] <chjj> explanation? its the owner document of an element
[15:25:48] <kenthree> you can have multiple documents?
[15:26:18] <chjj> absolutely
[15:26:43] <chjj> you can create abstract documents yourself, or you can have multiple documents in situations where you have iframes or other contexts
[15:27:13] <kenthree> how do I create and reference them?
[15:27:43] <chjj> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/document.implementation
[15:27:51] <chjj> thats how you would create one in an abstract way
[15:27:53] <kenthree> thanks
[15:28:06] <chjj> with iframes you can do frame.contentWindow or contentDocument
[15:28:51] <kenthree> i'm importing a full page from a php proxy script to manipulate with jquery
[15:29:01] <kenthree> html I mean
[15:43:47] <mparvin> hi
[15:44:25] <mparvin> where can I find the most comprehensive plugin for combobox based on jquery ui
[15:44:57] <mparvin> hey vuong?
[15:47:09] <Andy-> hey guys, using .replace('foo','bar') is there a way to make it replace all instances of "foo" on just the first one?
[15:48:00] <mparvin> .replaceAll
[15:48:49] <donburks> Andy: .replaceAll
[15:49:45] <Andy-> doi!
[15:49:47] <Andy-> thanks guys :)

[16:19:07] <muay-guy> hello, I'm trying to figure out why sum appears to be NaN here, when I actually substract the "$" with ".text().substr(1));"
[16:19:10] <muay-guy> http://pastie.org/2352865
[16:26:57] <donburks> muay-guy: Have you console.log'ed out what .text().substr(1) is for each iteration?
[16:26:57] <muay-guy> I'm trying to figure out why sum appears to be NaN here, when I actually substract the "$" with ".text().substr(1));"
[16:27:36] <muay-guy> donburks: I'm trying to debug it right now, and it seems to be that's what's messing with it
[16:27:57] <donburks> console.log() shouldn't mess with debugging. console.log is debugging.
[16:28:24] <donburks> In your .each(), start with a console.log(parseFloat(jQuery(this).text().substr(1)));
[16:28:42] <donburks> Then you'll see what is getting processed each time. Then you'll know what sum is NaN.
[16:28:49] <donburks> what/why
[16:29:27] <muay-guy> donburks:  "jQuery is not defined"
[16:30:11] <donburks> Now you know.
[16:31:35] <heyyo> I always wonder about how to solve this: if you have a neck in your database you can use master-slave. But if you have multiple users uploading images to your server, how to solve that??
[16:35:19] <muay-guy> donburks: that is strange, if I place a breakpoint in that line "this" is referring to td.subtotal (which is what it's supposed to do), but if I hit play again sum loses it's content and changes to NaN
[16:38:03] <donburks> What do you get if you echo out jQuery(this)?
[16:41:16] <muay-guy> let's see
[16:42:19] <muay-guy> I get "[object Object]"
[16:42:55] <tbranyen> muay-guy: are you using ie debug tools??
[16:43:13] <muay-guy> tbranyen: nope, I'm using firebug
[16:45:25] <donburks> Walk through it. If jQuery(this) gives you an object reference, then dump out jQuery(this).text()
[16:46:40] <muay-guy> donburks: blank message
[16:46:55] <donburks> Then again, now you know what the problem is.
[16:47:13] <muay-guy> if I click ok it shows me the price though
[16:51:05] <Taggnostr2> can I have more $(document).ready(...)?
[16:52:39] <imsky> yes you can has
[16:52:39] <bot-t1> (20 hours 9 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky :D
[16:53:08] <Taggnostr2> thanks
[17:00:47] <jaequery> what is this "deferred" i keep hearing lately
[17:02:21] <cogman> This is more of a javascript question, I have a pre with a lot of data in it. I want to go through it line by line, find patterns that match a given regex, and then spit out the line numbers that had that match. What is the best way to approach this?
[17:03:05] <donburks> Whenever you have a problem that you think requires regexp...you have two problems.
[17:04:52] <cogman> donburks:  This problem DOES require regexp.. The regex's are pretty simple, the problem is really is there a simple way to do something like for (each line in pre element) { does preline match regex if so, save line number }
[17:05:21] <cogman> I don't know what the best way to split lines up in javascript is.
[17:10:53] <SIDU> how to select: id=AB1 ; id=ABXX ... with the first 2 char same: =>$('#AB*') ?
[17:12:31] <lacrymology> excuse me, I have a jQuery array of objects, and I want to remove certain elements (the ones to which .attr('name').indexOf("mySearchString") returns -1, basically)
[17:13:03] <lacrymology> or rather, I want all elements whith name with a certain substring in it
[17:13:29] <SIDU> how to select id with the first 2-char same: eg id=AB1  .. id=ABBB
[17:14:43] <lacrymology> SIDU: same answer for both of us: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[17:16:44] <SIDU> lacrymology: i read above, not quite sure.
[17:17:08] <SIDU> $('id|=[AB]') ?
[17:17:16] <SIDU> doesn ot work
[17:17:59] <SIDU> i m selecting any id starts with 'AB'
[17:19:42] <coldhead> $('[id^="AB"]')
[17:24:34] <jaequery> hi, im trying to createa  news ticker using animate, its slowign down the site to a crawl
[17:24:45] <SIDU> coldhead: great ! that works perfect :D
[17:24:50] <jaequery> any advice?
[17:26:07] <SIDU> coldhead: similar way as CSS ? eg: #AB1,#ABss,#AB??{...} =>#AB*{...} ?
[17:26:45] <SIDU> coldhead: that's ok, i can do with a class. just lazy hand
[17:27:52] <coldhead> yeah SIDU, jQuery is helping you out with attribute selectors in a way that CSS won't
[17:28:02] <coldhead> classes are your friends there
[17:28:08] <SIDU> :D
[17:28:29] <coldhead> you are probably doing something wrong, jaequery
[17:28:32] <coldhead> do you have a link?
[17:28:43] <coldhead> or can you pastebin your code somewhere?

[17:37:14] <SIDU> coldhead: i got a big table: table.tr.td.input ==> when input onchange, i'd like to checkbox of first td of each tr
[17:37:34] <SIDU> well. input|select|textarea
[17:38:58] <SIDU> $('#myTable').tr.td.*.change=(function(){})?
[17:39:11] <coldhead> $(':input').change(function () {$(this).closest('tr').find(':checkbox:first').prop('checked', true);})
[17:39:33] <SIDU> wow. that's great !
[17:39:38] <coldhead> that's untested but something like that should work
[17:40:03] <SIDU> coldhead: what about: input or textarea or select ?
[17:40:26] <coldhead> :input should match all of those, i think
[17:40:33] <SIDU> ok
[17:40:40] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[17:40:48] <coldhead> Description: Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements.

[17:41:04] <coldhead> $('#myTable :input').change(function () {$(this).closest('tr').find(':checkbox:first').prop('checked', true);})
[17:41:07] <SIDU> i do not want to confuse other input
[17:41:11] <SIDU> good ok
[17:42:02] <SIDU> my table always in this way: <tr><td><input checkbox></td><td><select ...> ==> the checkbox always in the first td
[17:44:13] <mparvin> jquery 1.6.2 problem with replaceWith ex: ("#div1, #div2).replaceWith("<somecontent>"); doesnt work
[17:44:28] <mparvin> any thoughts?
[17:46:31] <mparvin> hello can anybody hear me?
[17:46:52] <adv_> anyone know of a secure multiple file uploader in php or jquery?
[17:47:43] <mparvin> hi adv_
[17:47:53] <mparvin> can u see my chat text
[17:47:59] <adv_> yes
[17:48:06] <mparvin> ohh ok thanks
[17:49:04] <coldhead> adv_: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload is very popular lately
[17:49:31] <mparvin> http://aquantum-demo.appspot.com/file-upload
[17:49:34] <adv_> coldhead, are there security issues possibly?
[17:50:20] <coldhead> of course, adv_
[17:50:25] <coldhead> there are always security issues
[17:50:35] <adv_> coldhead, what about ie support?
[17:50:45] <coldhead> i believe it works quite well across browsers
[17:50:49] <mparvin> coldhead question?? jquery 1.6.2 problem with replaceWith ex: ("#div1, #div2).replaceWith("<somecontent>"); doesnt work
[17:50:50] <coldhead> otherwise people wouldn't use it
[17:51:13] <mparvin> it also has the HTML 5 drag drop functionality
[17:51:14] <coldhead> mparvin: can you create a little demo on jsfiddle to show how it doesn't work?
[17:51:22] <adv_> it doenst list ie in the demo
[17:51:31] <coldhead> ?tias @ adv_
[17:51:31] <bot-t1> adv_, Try It And See

[17:52:26] <Taggnostr2> I'm doing two ajax requests with $.getJSON and in the callback function I'm populating an array that is then passed to another function called after the two requests, but afaiu ajax is not blocking and the function gets an empty array
[17:52:35] <adv_> thanks coldhead
[17:52:50] <Taggnostr2> how can I wait until both the requests are completed before passing the array?
[17:53:57] <coldhead> Taggnostr2: either poll for variables that signal the functions are complete or use async:false
[17:53:59] <SIDU> .classA{color:red;...} .classB{color:green;...} => howto make classB > classA instead of adding !important ?
[17:54:33] <coldhead> specificity, SIDU
[17:54:43] <Taggnostr2> coldhead, how do I "poll"?
[17:54:44] <SIDU> sometimes two !important makes nothing again :D
[17:54:54] <coldhead> .aclass.anotherclass {} is more specific than .anotherclass {}
[17:54:58] <coldhead> so it will have precedence
[17:55:02] <Taggnostr2> coldhead, just a while loop or is there something better?
[17:55:07] <coldhead> SIDU: read up on css specificity
[17:55:14] <SIDU> ok master
[17:55:17] <coldhead> also say "specificity" when you're drunk
[17:55:19] <coldhead> it's awesome
[17:55:27] <coldhead> ?mdc settimeout @ Taggnostr2
[17:55:28] <bot-t1> Taggnostr2, window.setTimeout - MDN Docs - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/window.setTimeout
[17:56:12] <coldhead> Taggnostr2: let me pseudocode you my preferred solution
[17:56:25] <Taggnostr2> ok
[17:58:55] <coldhead> Taggnostr2: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/456311/
[17:59:04] <Taggnostr2> thanks
[17:59:30] <coldhead> my pleasure
[17:59:33] <coldhead> good luck
[18:00:40] <Taggnostr2> is that some kind of lock?
[18:00:46] <coldhead> it sure is :)
[18:01:12] <coldhead> it's better than polling though
[18:01:39] <Taggnostr2> indeed this solution seems quite nice
[18:02:08] <coldhead> if they return at exactly the same moment it might bork :\
[18:02:22] <Taggnostr2> why window.__x_complete and not a normal variable?
[18:02:43] <coldhead> you can use a scoped variable, i didn't want to make assumptions about the scopes
[18:03:01] <coldhead> window lets it work from different files or $(document).ready()s
[18:03:02] <Taggnostr2> ok
[18:03:23] <Taggnostr2> the requests are just one after the other
[18:03:43] <coldhead> ah then you can do it much more cleanly
[18:04:05] <coldhead> that is a matter for yourself

[18:04:51] <Taggnostr2> ok, I'm going to read something about locks to see if I can prevent breakage in case they finish in the same moment, thanks again for the help
[18:05:32] <coldhead> SIDU: i'd lean on jQ to make your life easier, and only worry about performance once someone complains
[18:05:33] <adv_> does this file uploader work with ssl?
[18:05:39] <coldhead> ?optimisation
[18:05:39] <bot-t1> The First Rule of Program Optimization: Don't do it. The Second Rule of Program Optimization (for experts only!): Don't do it yet.
[18:06:15] <coldhead> i have no idea, adv_. probably
[18:06:31] <Taggnostr2> "Premature optimization is the root of all evil." - Donald Knuth
[18:06:49] <SIDU> coldhead: i make this: var $=function(id){return document.getElementById(id);} also works
[18:06:52] <coldhead> Taggnostr2: one way might be to store the completed variables in a closure accessible only to allDone(). and have it run and check/update them
[18:07:15] <coldhead> SIDU: i have never used getElementByID in my life :)
[18:07:22] <SIDU> :D
[18:07:26] <coldhead> all jQuery, all the time
[18:08:59] <SIDU> coldhead: well you win, i m moving into jq
[18:09:41] <coldhead> sure makes life easier <33
[18:09:49] <SIDU> coldhead: have a look at my app: sidu.sf.net, i m going to re-make it in jq. though not much js used.
[18:10:48] <SIDU> who made : document.getElementById(..)==> that's really sucks hands
[18:11:14] <SIDU> take time to type each time :(
[18:11:35] <coldhead> SIDU: once jQuery infects a project it makes it much easier and more tempting to add nice features and functionality
[18:11:44] <SIDU> $() == smart use!
[18:11:51] <donCams> that's why IDEs now has intellisense
[18:11:53] <coldhead> everything can get richer and ajaxier and more animated
[18:12:05] <donCams> jQuery = awesome
[18:12:18] <coldhead> ===*
[18:12:22] <SIDU> coldhead: where is your site, let me have a look as well and learn
[18:12:28] <donCams> just finished an 'ajaxy' project and i'm a javascript noob
[18:12:53] <coldhead> SIDU http://coldhead.miketaylr.com/
[18:13:04] <donCams> - no memory leaks and everything was done oop btw -
[18:13:16] <kborchers> lol
[18:13:17] <coldhead> good job, donCams
[18:13:36] <SIDU> coldhead: well. that's crap site. mine is better :D
[18:13:48] <coldhead> that site has gotten me a lot of work
[18:14:09] <SIDU> coldhead: well. paid site usually looks bad.
[18:14:09] <donCams> wtf. marquee?
[18:14:09] <coldhead> and i challenge you to find a site with more rotating skulls
[18:15:01] <donCams> that was like a web site i made in high school. heh
[18:16:12] <coldhead> it's still under construction
[18:16:17] <donCams> i know
[18:16:19] <SIDU> :D
[18:16:19] <coldhead> i think it might say that somewhere on the page
[18:16:27] <coldhead> needs more alert(), now that i think of it
[18:16:34] <coldhead> i'll add it to the TODO list
[18:16:39] <coldhead> and start writing unit tests for it
[18:16:40] <donCams> put some blinking text
[18:16:49] <coldhead> ooh good call
[18:17:02] <coldhead> it validates pretty well, too
[18:17:06] <coldhead> not perfect but it's getting there
[18:17:34] <donCams> good times good times
[18:28:00] <coldhead> bot-t: welcome back
[18:28:01] <bot-t> coldhead, Get - It can be: http://docs.jquery.com/Get
[18:28:08] <coldhead> It can be?
[18:28:39] <kborchers> bot-t: yo
[18:28:40] <bot-t> What's up
[18:29:11] <mparvin> thanks man!! replaceWith works a little different from the older versions of jquery
[18:30:52] <mparvin> $("#div1, #div2).replaceWith("test"); replaces one test for both the divs in older versions looks like it was corrected later on
[18:31:27] <coldhead> interesting
[18:33:38] <mparvin> a stupid question?? can you pass -1 number as a parameter to a function
[18:34:17] <coldhead> sure you can
[18:34:50] <coldhead> ?eval function aids(num) {return "it was" + num;} aids(-1);
[18:34:51] <bot-t> coldhead: "it was-1"
[18:35:48] <mparvin> thanks..
[18:37:19] <SIDU> coldhead: <div id='abc' class='xx'>.. howto get id by class? $('.xx').click=(function(){alert($(this).id)})
[18:37:42] <kborchers> SIDU: .attr('id')
[18:37:49] <SIDU> ah. ok
[18:37:52] <mparvin> will you get a NaN on any value of pp in fn:pp-1??
[18:41:24] <cnnr> with jquery UI, when dragging a draggable into a sortable element, how do I change the amount the sortable elements drop down to make room for the draggable to be dropped there?
[18:50:29] <SIDU> coldhead: $('#id').background-image-toggle('a.png','b.png') ? how to toggle bg img on click ?
[18:51:07] <SIDU> :D
[18:51:29] <coldhead> SIDU: have two classes in your CSS with different background images
[18:51:33] <coldhead> then use ?toggleclass
[18:51:41] <coldhead> thanks for nothing, bot-t
[18:51:44] <coldhead> I'LL DO IT MYSELF
[18:51:58] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[19:04:45] <SIDU> well. i found .removeClass , howto addClass ?
[19:05:30] <Damiox> hello
[19:06:05] <coldhead> TOGGLECLASS, bro
[19:06:07] <kborchers> SIDU: coldhead gave you the answer, you don't need addClass and removeClass, use toggleClass
[19:06:20] <SIDU> ok found :)
[19:06:30] <coldhead> <div class="something"> in the html then $('div').toggeclass('something someotherthing')
[19:06:33] <Damiox> I need to save some data and I was wondering if whether I should go for $.data() or $.attr() ...
[19:06:34] <coldhead> MAGIC HAPPENS, people
[19:06:48] <coldhead> MAGIC AND PHYSICS
[19:07:04] <kborchers> coldhead: magic only happens when you use $.unicorn
[19:07:52] <coldhead> try {$.unicorn()} catch (magic) {}
[19:08:27] <kborchers> touch
[19:08:49] <radarwork_> would this get the first data from the dropdown? $('select.myid option:selected').val(); ?
[19:09:58] <kborchers> radarwork_: just do $("select.myid").val(); assuming myid is a class
[19:10:22] <radarwork_> if div then select#myid ?
[19:10:34] <kborchers> huh?
[19:10:51] <kborchers> if it's an id just do $("#myid").val();
[19:11:35] <radarwork_> <select name="myid">
[19:11:55] <radarwork_> so $("select.myid").val() ?
[19:12:04] <kborchers> radarwork_: ok, then do $("select[name='myid']").val();
[19:12:11] <radarwork_> ah,
[19:12:12] <radarwork_> thanks
[19:12:17] <Damiox> was my question too cr4ppy? Hehe... I'm trying to avoid a memory leak in some browser, so I'm not sure what way I should take
[19:14:08] <kborchers> Damiox: i don't know the best answer to your question but i would say use .data since creating random attributes on elements is not valid HTML ... just my 2 cents
[19:15:09] <Damiox> yeah, I was thinking about that so that is something why I dont wanna choose the $.attr option
[19:15:35] <radarwork_> to set the value could i do ("select[name='myid']").val("new val"); ?
[19:15:44] <Damiox> but I'm not sure if $.data may create some memory leaks in browsers such as IE (yes I know: damn IE)
[19:15:44] <crankharder> for a click event, how do I check if the target is an anchor?
[19:16:22] <kborchers> radarwork_: yes, if that val exists as the value of an option i believe that works just fine
[19:17:28] <kborchers> crankharder: event.target.tagName
[19:18:06] <kborchers> Damiox: that is the part i am not sure about as well ... but you can count on IE to be a POS
[19:18:38] <madprops> can i make this to get iframes with another url? $("#post_holder iframe[src^='http://www.youtube.com']")
[19:18:53] <madprops> like getting the yt vids and vimeo vids
[19:19:30] <Damiox> thanks kborchers for your feedback
[19:19:35] <kborchers> np
[19:19:55] <Nautilus> has anyone here use jScrollPane?  I'm wondering if I can style the scrollbar as two arrows (see http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/846/arrowstyling.jpg/ and the two arrows in lower-right of image)
[19:20:05] <radarwork_> kborchers, by setting the value, there are actually 5 options listed in the select, whose value is it supposed to update ? (i m still having troubel running the code)
[19:20:55] <radarwork_> i would think just the first one but i havent seen the result yet
[19:21:09] <kborchers> radarwork_: it would not update a value, it would select the option that had a matching value ... are you trying to change the value of an option?
[19:21:18] <radarwork_> yes
[19:21:25] <kborchers> ok, that won't work then
[19:21:32] <radarwork_> ok,
[19:21:57] <kborchers> it would help if i could see your code. can you throw a fiddle together?
[19:22:07] <radarwork_> ok
[19:22:32] <djQuery> $('optionselector').val(someval);
[19:22:40] <djQuery> ?demo
[19:22:45] <djQuery> frigin bot
[19:22:49] <djQuery> .seen bot-t
[19:22:49] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 34 minutes and 23 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Ping timeout: 260 seconds
[19:23:00] <djQuery> every time i come on it leaves
[19:23:04] <kborchers> yeah bot showed up for like 30  min then bailed again
[19:23:18] <radarwork_> kborchers, http://jsfiddle.net/kPgF8/
[19:23:33] <kborchers> ok, and what are you trying to update?
[19:24:13] <radarwork_> depending on condition, i want to add "selected" in the place of "Selett a feat"
[19:24:53] <kborchers> ok, then what i said earlier will work ... you do not need to update a value of an option
[19:25:29] <kborchers> by setting .val('98'), the select would show secondf as selected
[19:26:11] <djQuery> better would be to just use css to set the background color of the selected option
[19:26:20] <radarwork_> kborchers, but i walso want to update the value to 0
[19:26:28] <djQuery> option:selected { background-color: yellow; }
[19:26:29] <radarwork_> so i would change both value and html
[19:27:25] <djQuery> still it would just be .val(something).html('something else');
[19:28:10] <radarwork_> ok
[19:28:18] <radarwork_> i think it makes sense now
[19:28:21] <kborchers> djQuery: that wouldn't work since he's selecting the select not an option. setting .html would remove all of the options
[19:28:25] <radarwork_> that i played with jsfiddle
[19:28:33] <radarwork_> oh!
[19:28:36] <radarwork_> that might be correct
[19:28:46] <djQuery> kborchers: still sounds good to me as I dont like selects
[19:28:49] <kborchers> heh
[19:29:14] <radarwork_> kborchers, u were right, it removed everything
[19:32:11] <radarwork_> kborchers, fixed it, http://jsfiddle.net/kPgF8/1/
[19:32:14] <radarwork_> thanks for helping out
[19:32:59] <kborchers> radarwork_: np, i'm still a little confused about the purpose of what you are doing but if it does what you need it to ... cool
[19:33:24] <radarwork_> well, here is whats happeingin
[19:33:33] <radarwork_> pupulated the list from database
[19:33:47] <radarwork_> all at the same time, and the first/default value was "Select..."
[19:34:01] <radarwork_> now they want like, if anything was already selected, then display that at first
[19:34:29] <kborchers> hmmm, ok
[19:34:34] <radarwork_> so i dont want to do anything with php as that might cause various problems, so a clean ajax would fix it
[19:34:51] <radarwork_> might not be the best way but it will work
[19:35:19] <kborchers> ok
[19:36:51] <radarwork_> wow, jquery is just so powerful, i am glad i dont have to do javascript
[19:37:52] <radarwork_> also, json is so powerful I am glad i dont have to write xml
[19:43:25] <guest26853> A while back I read an article about being able to have jquery code before the jquery object is even defined. I'm having trouble finding it again though. Anyone here know anything about that?
[19:45:25] <radarwork_> how would i put a variable here? $("select[name='name'+myvar]") seems to fail
[19:46:46] <_rob_>  $("select[name=name"+myvar+"]")
[19:46:54] <guest26853> radarwork_: $("select[name='name'"+myvar+"]") should work.
[19:47:07] <radarwork_> wow, too many quotes :(
[19:51:37] <radarwork_> thanks _rob_ that worked, guest26853  i had troubel with that one
[19:52:08] <_rob_> np
[19:54:07] <radarwork_> is the first item in a json data item 0 or 1 ?
[19:54:28] <radarwork_> i dont like it but looks like its 1
[19:54:58] <_rob_> in an array it's zero
[20:00:29] <radarwork_> darn, it gets crazier, could i do a subrtaction? like +myvar-1+ ?
[20:01:18] <radarwork_> awesome () works
[20:02:50] <_rob_> radarwork, perhaps you should read up on string concatenation in javascript
[20:08:17] * coldhead np: stereolab - metronomic underground
[20:08:36] <solidus-river> hey all, how do i animate margin-top or something like that
[20:08:41] <solidus-river> it seems using the - breaks javascript syntax
[20:13:05] <_rob_> why would you use a hyphen(-) for .animate() ?
[20:16:34] <solidus-river> _rob_: $('#div').animate({margin-top: '52px'}, 200);
[20:16:34] <solidus-river> ?
[20:20:31] <Davey> so, I seem to be hitting a bug; $('li').outerHeight(true) is return the height sans padding
[20:21:05] <Davey> er, in Safari, specifically
[20:22:54] <_rob_> but aren't css attributes with hyphens replaced with camel case? ie: z-index = zIndex, margin-top = marginTop?
[20:23:04] <_rob_> I think you can also put the value in quotes
[20:23:28] <jtaby> Hey, if I use relative values in .css() and .animate(), I can't add a negative number like this: $('#box').css('margin-left','+=-1');
[20:23:29] <_rob_> .css({'margin-top': 'value'})
[20:23:29] <jtaby> http://jsfiddle.net/F7Ybw/
[20:23:42] <jtaby> It seems to me like it should be possible, what do you guys think?
[20:24:09] <jtaby> it lets you do things like: $('#box').css('margin-left','+='+value)
[20:24:18] <jtaby> and if value is negative, it'll do the right thing
[20:39:01] <adv_> anyone knows how can i add extension type checking and mime type checking and also verify that uploaded file is an image with https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload ?
[20:53:14] <phoe6> can someone help me with this simple radio use case - http://jsfiddle.net/ndJFD/5/
[20:53:39] <phoe6> I simply want to see radio select workign.
[20:54:32] <Cork> phoe6: your selector is broken
[20:54:46] <Cork> thats xml path selectors, not css selectors
[20:55:03] <Cork> in other words, remove the @
[20:55:07] <phoe6> Cork: newbie here.  Which one is the selector?
[20:55:10] <phoe6> oh okay.
[20:55:55] <Cork> phoe6: the strings where you define what element you want, is called selectors ("input[name='option_layout']")
[20:56:06] <Cork> phoe6: and they sould be written like css does it
[20:57:14] <Cork> phoe6: additionally i would prob put the input outside the label, to get it symantically correct
[20:57:21] <Cork> (and use the for attribute instead)
[20:59:19] <phoe6> var ed = $("input[name="option_layout")
[20:59:22] <phoe6> and ed.checked?
[20:59:36] <Cork> ed[0].checked
[20:59:46] <Cork> or ed.is(':checked')
[20:59:46] <smplstick> ?checkboxes
[20:59:47] <bot-t> As of jQuery 1.6, use .prop("checked") to test checked, and .prop("checked", true or false) to change the state. In jQuery 1.5 you could check the box with .attr("checked","checked") and to uncheck it, do .removeAttr("checked")
[21:00:13] <Cork> ah, i constantly forget the new prop command :)
[21:00:36] <smplstick> I think .is(':checked') still works.
[21:00:41] <smplstick> not too sure tho
[21:00:49] <Cork> it does
[21:02:31] <phoe6> http://jsfiddle.net/ndJFD/7/
[21:02:42] <phoe6> does not work still.
[21:03:20] <jtannenbaum> I'm doing $('input[name=foo]').attr('readonly','false'); and it's going from readonly=true to readonly=readonly
[21:03:54] <Cork> phoe6: theres no group class in your html
[21:04:27] <phoe6> Cork - can you suggest some simple stmt to check. $(this).alert("Selected 1"): ?
[21:05:40] <Cork> phoe6: ok, one min let me fix this up a bit
[21:05:51] <marcus1060> Hi, is there a way to check if an element exists before or after another sibling element?
[21:06:37] <Cork> marcus1060: see ?.prev or see ?.prevAll (same with next and nextAll
[21:06:37] <bot-t> marcus1060, .prev([selector]): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[21:06:37] <bot-t> marcus1060, .prevAll([selector]): Get all preceding siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prevAll/
[21:07:51] <marcus1060> Thanks, I'll take a look.
[21:11:25] <Cork> marcus1060: http://jsfiddle.net/ndJFD/10/
[21:11:45] <phoe6> Cork, I guess that was for me.
[21:11:53] <Cork> ugg
[21:11:55] <Cork> ya sorry
[21:12:21] <sgp913_> hello, i am having trouble getting this code to work in drupal, and i'm thinking there may be a problem with the code, even though it works fine in jsfiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/b6aB5/ i appreciate everyone's help
[21:12:25] <phoe6> Thanks anyway.
[21:12:28] <phoe6> got the idea.
[21:12:35] <Cork> phoe6: heh np :)
[21:13:17] <Cork> phoe6: the reason i added {} on your if statements is has a reason; if you ever want to validate your js code
[21:13:39] <Cork> phoe6: the validators will puke over them missing, so its just as good to add them from the start
[21:14:18] <phoe6> I see. BTW, what is the $(this).blur()  for, I don't see any effect if I comment/uncomment them.
[21:14:34] <Cork> phoe6: was there before, so donno
[21:14:41] <Cork> blur has no meaning
[21:14:50] <phoe6> yeah,
[21:15:06] <Cork> as it can't blur a focused element without focusing another one
[21:15:41] <phoe6> oh ok.

[21:25:54] <zoidfarb> I've got a sortable, and I'm getting an exception when adding a draggable to that sortable (using the connectToSortable option)

[21:27:23] <Cork> mikeycgto: ya a new cryptated one :)

[21:50:42] <zoidfarb> a(this).data("draggable") is undefined
[21:50:42] <zoidfarb> this.instance.placeholder.remove();e._...tions;if(c.css("opacity"))d._opacity=
[21:51:19] <zoidfarb> as far as I can work out, it's because it's trying to remove a placeholder, as though the item were being moved in a sortable
[21:51:45] <zoidfarb> but because the item didn't start out in a sortable, it didn't leave any placeholder behind
[21:53:18] <kenthree> $('<img src="foo.jpg">') ; will cause the browser to send a request.. Is there any way to use jquery's selector engine without it creating dom elements?
[21:53:53] <AfroTurf> how do i prevent a form from submitting on the return key
[21:54:45] <Lochlan> sick a scrabble solver
[21:55:00] <kborchers> AfroTurf: you shouldn't do that, how do i submit the form if i don't have a mouse?
[21:55:03] <zoidfarb> AfroTurf: maybe this would help? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4355594/intercepting-all-key-presses-with-jquery-before-they-are-processed
[21:55:17] <Lochlan> kenthree, does the img not have a class/id ?
[21:55:30] <zoidfarb> Lochlan, thanks. = ) It's just a hobby project to try to learn about javascript + flask
[21:55:35] <Lochlan> or is it inside a container?
[21:55:44] <AfroTurf> kborchers: ok then specifically if i'm focues in a particular input
[21:55:51] <kenthree> no it's just a string, created on the fly
[21:55:55] <Lochlan> ha futurama and scrabble
[21:55:57] <Lochlan> nice one
[21:55:58] <kenthree> not attached to the document
[21:57:35] <AfroTurf> zoidfarb: yes, but which key is the return key?
[21:57:47] <AfroTurf> 13?
[21:57:51] <kenthree> yep
[21:57:55] <coldhead> it's usually the big one that isn't the spacebar
[21:58:02] <kborchers> heh
[21:58:04] <Lochlan> haha
[21:58:04] <coldhead> with an arrow on it
[21:59:05] <AfroTurf> ha
[21:59:10] <zoidfarb> So, is this exception something I should care/be worried about? Or can I safely ignore it and go on with my life?
[22:00:40] <bricker> Anybody here using full calendar? I'm trying to set unselectCancel but it doesn't seem to be working.
[22:01:03] <bricker> unselectCancel: '#event-dialog', but clicking on the dialog clears the selection still
[22:02:36] <Taggnostr2> coldhead, what if I make an object with a counter set to 2 (I have 2 ajax requests) and a function that when called decrements the counter and executes other code if the counter reached 0? will it still break if both the requests complete in the exact same moment?
[22:02:41] <SIDU> coldhead: is there .substr() function in jq ?

[22:15:40] <SIDU> coldhead: howto get id in this case ?
[22:16:45] <coldhead> ?p @ SIDU
[22:16:45] <bot-t> SIDU, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:16:58] <coldhead> what err do you get
[22:16:59] <SIDU> just online : $('[id^="Hpop"]').append($(this).attr('id'));
[22:17:17] <SIDU> coldhead: just one line code : $('[id^="Hpop"]').append($(this).attr('id'));
[22:17:26] <coldhead> with just oneline this probably refers to window
[22:17:42] <coldhead> you will need two statements
[22:17:44] <coldhead> at least
[22:17:50] <SIDU> coldhead: ok .
[22:19:24] <SIDU> coldhead: actually i m trying to triggle a click event, however it does not work, so i m try to add this:
[22:19:35] <SIDU> $('[id^="Hpop"]').attr('onclick','pop("'+$(this).attr('id')+'")');
[22:19:58] <SIDU> coldhead: sad it does not work
[22:21:16] <SIDU> coldhead: maybe im over-use jq. i might go back to add code: <b onclick='pop(3)'> instead
[22:22:11] <SIDU> i m trying to convert: <b onlick='pop(3)'> ==> <b id='Hpop3'>
[22:22:36] <SIDU> coldhead: both not looking bad . old method works anyway.
[22:25:42] <SIDU> coldhead: here is my working example:
[22:25:47] <rubknob> does datepicker have icons I can use for icon trigger or do I have to supply my own?
[22:25:49] <coldhead> SIDU: don't ever use onclick again
[22:25:59] <coldhead> or i will break every finger on your masturbation hand
[22:26:02] <coldhead> those days are gone
[22:26:07] <coldhead> ?click @ SIDU

[22:27:33] <SIDU> coldhead: <b id='Hpop3'>click here </b><div id='pop3'>...</div>

[22:32:23] <Cork> SIDU: why don't you just use .next() ?
[22:33:05] <SIDU> ah.. that 's even better. let me try ...
[22:33:13] <SIDU> i just started jq :D
[22:33:16] <coldhead> SIDU: http://jsfiddle.net/arXw4/1/
[22:33:26] <coldhead> yes, next() is better
[22:33:32] <coldhead> do whatever Cork says, always
[22:33:39] <Cork> lol
[22:33:39] <coldhead> IN ALL MATTERS
[22:34:30] <coldhead> SIDU: http://jsfiddle.net/arXw4/2/
[22:35:35] <Cork> coldhead: 'div' doesn't really add much to that statement
[22:36:09] <Cork> it will only look at the direct following sibling anyway, so if its not the wanted element, it will fail
[22:36:29] <coldhead> it stops a picture of a cute kitten that might someday be inserted between the elements from being toggled by mistake
[22:36:33] <coldhead> it's "defensive"
[22:36:43] <Cork> true
[22:36:48] <Cork> fail graisfully
[22:36:58] <coldhead> but that's a matter of taste huh
[22:37:14] <coldhead> i mean, for this pissy criticism, you're no longer on my team for kickball
[22:37:28] <coldhead> but hey, who even plays kickball, right?
[22:37:30] <coldhead> IDIOTS
[22:37:32] <coldhead> AND FATTIES
[22:37:40] <Cork> i prefer the code to fail hard when if i do something wrong, or do it dynamically (use nextAll())
[22:37:48] <Cork> -when
[22:37:53] <coldhead> nextAll is too powerful for SIDU
[22:37:55] <SIDU> coldhead: now i realize jq sucks at this code: $(..).click(function(){}) ==> why not just ...click({})
[22:37:58] <coldhead> he was using onclick a minute ago
[22:38:16] <Cork> SIDU: thats not jquerys fault, thats just how function works in js
[22:38:20] <coldhead> SIDU: because {} is an object literal, function () {} is a function
[22:38:22] <SIDU> function() does nothing
[22:38:27] <coldhead> and you want a function
[22:38:34] <SIDU> ok you win -- coldhead

[22:41:30] <coldhead> yes snottlebocket
[22:43:47] <snottlebocket> I have a question about selectors, I have a number of div's on my page each, they all have the class 'project' and a class for each label that matches them. Ie. class="project inspiration video audio", can I create a selector that selects any div that has project but not inspiration as a way of hiding any project that doesn't contain the selected label?
[22:44:15] <Cork> ?:not @ snottlebocket
[22:44:15] <bot-t> snottlebocket, :not(selector): Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[22:44:47] <snottlebocket> I read that, I'm trying to create a selector that matches one requirement and not matches another requirement
[22:45:05] <snottlebocket> if I simply phase out all divs that do not have 'inspiration' for instance it'll hide the entire website
[22:45:08] <Cork> snottlebocket: .project:not(.inspiration)
[22:45:37] <snottlebocket> ash, I knew it had to be some syntax I misunderstood, let me try that
[22:46:25] <snottlebocket> I'll let you go back to talking about carnivorous Korean girls
[22:47:46] <coldhead> i think we're good for now but thanks snottlebocket
[22:48:31] <mib_mib> hi guys, i'm trying to form a jquery css selector that selects divs whose inline css style tag has 'position:relatve' but may have other attributes, i.e. <div style="position:relative; height:10px;">..</div>  -- how can i do this?
[22:48:57] <Cork> mib_mib: you can't select on css values
[22:49:05] <Cork> add a class and select on that
[22:49:15] <mib_mib> Cork: you cant?
[22:49:21] <Cork> nope
[22:49:39] <Cork> well you can do something horrible like select on the content of the style attribute if its inline
[22:49:43] <mib_mib> dang... i thought you could do something with the bracket notation like div[class='blah']
[22:49:46] <Cork> but not if its in a css file
[22:49:57] <mib_mib> yes how can i do that
[22:49:58] <chjj> Cork: if its an inline attribute, do div[style*="position:relative"]
[22:50:12] <mib_mib> ah that *= is nice, what does that do exactly
[22:50:12] <chjj> inline style rather
[22:50:18] <chjj> it looks for a substring
[22:50:20] <Cork> chjj: like i said, horrible :)
[22:50:35] <mib_mib> its not good, but unfortunately i don't control the html generation, just parsing it
[22:51:01] <Cork> mib_mib: that selector will look for every div then find the style attribute and then search in its value
[22:51:14] <mib_mib> ah nice! i was replicating this behavior, this is great
[22:51:39] <Cork> :s
[22:51:44] <Cork> "nice"!?! >_<'
[22:52:13] <mib_mib> dont worry, i'm actually using a ruby gem called nokogiri that uses css selectors -- not doing any of this parsing in jquery, but the selectors are the same
[22:52:35] <Cork> if its plain css you don't have *=
[22:52:44] <Cork> its a jquery addative
[22:52:45] <chjj> ...
[22:52:48] <chjj> no its not
[22:52:52] <chjj> have you ever used css?
[22:53:19] <beasty> hmm
[22:53:46] <beasty> is it normal that each time i change the dom i need to reassign a 'click()' ?
[22:53:54] <Cork> chjj: sure and the selectors that exist is ~=  and |=
[22:54:03] <chjj> ?
[22:54:08] <Cork> (ontop of plain = though)
[22:54:14] <Cork> http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#attribute-selectors
[22:54:15] <chjj> *= is an attribute operator
[22:54:22] <Cork> in jquery ya
[22:54:22] <chjj> thats the css2 spec
[22:54:30] <chjj> its not 2000 anymore
[22:54:37] <mib_mib> beasty: are you adding a new element that .click may refer to? if so, check out the .live function
[22:55:07] <Cork> chjj: well expecting that a server script actually implement css3 might be counting to much
[22:55:38] <beasty> hmm ok
[22:55:44] <beasty> mib_mib: for now it works
[22:55:58] <beasty> i just have a function() containing the .click
[22:56:06] <chjj> Cork: i think even ie7 supports *=, go try it
[22:56:09] <beasty> and i reassign it everytime a item is added
[22:56:14] <chjj> at the very least ie8
[22:56:17] <Cork> chjj: it doesn't
[22:56:21] <chjj> yes it does
[22:56:33] <Cork> chjj: ie8 and ie7 don't have any support for css3
[22:57:18] <chjj> very untrue
[22:57:36] <chjj> overflow: scroll-x and scroll-y are supported by ie8
[22:57:39] <chjj> i know that for certain
[22:57:58] <chjj> or
[22:57:59] <chjj> i mean
[22:58:01] <chjj> overflow-x
[22:58:04] <chjj> etc
[22:58:19] <chjj> im fairly certain *= is supported by at least ie8
[22:58:50] <chjj> i dont feel like starting up a virtualbox for ie right now, so someone should test it to prove me right
[22:59:09] <beasty> what do you need ?
[22:59:28] <coldhead> instead of spending all this time supporting IE, maybe we should think about supporting ourselves
[22:59:32] <chjj> here, wikipedia knows all
[22:59:35] <chjj> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_layout_engines_(Cascading_Style_Sheets)
[22:59:53] <beasty> chjj: i have ie8
[22:59:58] <beasty> give me a page and i'll check
[22:59:58] <chjj> E[attr*="value"]Contains substring [IE] 7.0
[23:00:16] <chjj> i cant believe i had to dig that up to prove something so basic
[23:01:20] <beasty> and morning coldhead :)
[23:03:08] <chjj> anyway
[23:03:33] <mib_mib> thanks for help
[23:04:13] <coldhead> hi beasty <3
[23:04:40] <chjj> mib_mib: it might be faster to do something like $('div').filter(function(el) { return el.style.position === 'relative'; })
[23:04:49] <chjj> then you dont have to rely on sizzle
[23:04:58] <mib_mib> what is sizzle
[23:05:06] <chjj> the selector engine jquery uses
[23:05:34] <mib_mib> chjj: yeah so i'm not actually using jquery - i'm using a ruby gem called nokogiri that uses the same type of css selectors
[23:05:48] <chjj> oh, i see
[23:05:55] <mib_mib> chjj: but the *= worked like a charm
[23:06:04] <chjj> ;p
[23:06:33] <madprops> what is happening here exactly? http://dpaste.com/591790/ why the comma?
[23:07:40] <chjj> madprops: what do you mean?
[23:07:49] <coldhead> that's just declaring multiple,variables,at,once
[23:08:02] <coldhead> you could do var multiple; var variables; var at; var once;
[23:08:06] <coldhead> if you prefer
[23:08:18] <madprops> ah that's what i thought
[23:08:26] <coldhead> no you didn;t
[23:08:27] <madprops> also the $ is confusing
[23:08:40] <chjj> the comma operator in javascript can combine multiple statements into one, with var the comma and equals sign have a slightly different purpose, theyre kind of sugar
[23:08:57] <chjj> when use in a var statement
[23:08:59] <coldhead> the $ is quasihungarian notation so you remember that $thing is a jQuery thing and you can do $thing.somethingFromJquery()
[23:09:15] <chjj> var a = 1; is just sugar for var a; a = 1;
[23:09:17] <coldhead> it's quite common and helpful
[23:09:22] <madprops> also how can I turn that so that allVideos catches iframes with youtube and iframes with vimeo?
[23:10:13] <chjj> you could use a grouping, comma separate two selectors
[23:10:56] <madprops> chjj, like iframe[something], iframe[something] ?
[23:11:04] <chjj> yes
[23:11:10] <madprops> ok thanks

[23:46:12] <quarkimedes> but i need to get this done by tomorrow
[23:46:21] <quarkimedes> if you need more context i can do that
[23:47:08] <Murugaratham> nothing wrong when i clicked on the links
[23:47:17] <quarkimedes> it doesn't actually scroll though
[23:47:23] <quarkimedes> you need the other library
[23:47:31] <quarkimedes> i guess i can paste all that in there
[23:47:45] <coldhead> quarkimedes: you can hotlink to the lib if it's somewhere online
[23:47:57] <coldhead> use the Additional Resources or somesuch on the left
[23:48:14] <coldhead> we'll get there little fella! don't lose hope!
[23:48:20] <juha_> coldhead: you would also hate the visit if the tigger would be crying :'(
[23:48:36] <coldhead> maybe if the tiger hadn't let himself be caught...
[23:48:48] <juha_> not a very smart tigger indeed
[23:49:05] <coldhead> he is crying because he was so stupid
[23:49:12] <coldhead> also maybe he is fat
[23:49:36] <quarkimedes> http://jsfiddle.net/qPNMe/
[23:49:39] <juha_> maybe he's crying because you are evil, you austrian evil man
[23:49:42] <quarkimedes> coldhead: i have it there
[23:49:48] <quarkimedes> i just pasted it in
[23:49:58] <sasori> question: i have a js file, this file launches a modal confirm popup when submit button of the page is clicked..the confirm popup then launches a modal that contains input form..if am gonna place the validation functions of the modal input form, will that work ? i mean if the functions are separated from the original js file that smmoned the jquery modal confirm popup ?
[23:50:55] <siovene> Hello. Noob question: can anybody tell me why this doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/aRuTW/1/
[23:51:13] <siovene> (It's 5 lines of jquery code, please check it out :))
[23:51:25] <Dr4g> siovene: it is 'click' not 'clicked'
[23:51:35] <siovene> Dr4g: thanks :)
[23:51:45] <Dr4g> look http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[23:52:04] <Dr4g> you can use .click() instead of .bind('click')
[23:52:35] <siovene> thank you
[23:53:05] <coldhead> quarkimedes: http://jsfiddle.net/qPNMe/2/
[23:53:10] <coldhead> that's more like what we need
[23:53:17] <coldhead> is that the error you see?
[23:53:22] <coldhead> about no slice method?
[23:54:16] <quarkimedes> coldhead: let me see if i can hotlink the source
[23:54:47] <coldhead> i just did bro
[23:54:50] <coldhead> it's hotlinked there
[23:54:53] <coldhead> pay more attention
[23:55:04] <emilkarl> can I add some JS that only will run on iOS and android?
[23:55:21] <quarkimedes> oh
[23:55:32] <coldhead> someone in a forum is claiming that you get that error when the thing you are scrolling does not exist
[23:55:38] <coldhead> but your elements do
[23:55:43] <quarkimedes> coldhead: my bad, i need to sleep
[23:55:46] <quarkimedes> hmmm
[23:55:54] <quarkimedes> yeah
[23:56:00] <quarkimedes> they definitly exist
[23:56:07] <juha_> coldie, about the live(submit), damn i hate it now
[23:56:14] <quarkimedes> you think there could just be an error in the library?
[23:56:53] <coldhead> could be, quarkimedes
[23:57:05] <coldhead> i would try some of the other options, other than the -=100px
[23:57:11] <coldhead> to see if it works at all
[23:57:15] <quarkimedes> card-fan1 exists btw, its just defined elsewhere
[23:57:18] <quarkimedes> coldhead: alright
[23:57:23] <coldhead> i feel ya, juha_
[23:57:59] <coldhead> quarkimedes: you might also want to try ?scrolltop
[23:58:00] <coldhead> instead
[23:58:07] <coldhead> bot-t: scrolltop
[23:58:08] <bot-t> .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[23:58:28] <coldhead> i don't really get what your code is trying to do, quarkimedes
[23:59:27] <Cork> ?.scrollTo
[23:59:28] <bot-t> Cork, ScrollTo | jQuery Plugins - With this plugin, you will easily scroll overflowed elements, and the screen itself. It gives you access to many different options to customize and various ways to specify where to scroll. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[23:59:37] <quarkimedes> i have a small little div, and i want to scroll different "frames" through it
[23:59:49] <quarkimedes> from right to left
