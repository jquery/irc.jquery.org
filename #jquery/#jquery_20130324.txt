[00:02:03] <Hilton> rawrg.
[00:16:17] <Hilton> Okay, something weird is going on.
[00:16:40] <Hilton> Everything is working now, with my PHP file returning HTTP codes for errors, or HTML on success.
[00:18:57] <yrus> Hello =)
[00:20:11] <Hilton> The return is the new value plus some markup.  success: function(data, status, jqXHR) { } - inside here, alert(data); shows me exactly the markup I expect back. And .find('.form_value .value').html('Testing'); changes the element expected to read "Testing". But  .find('.form_value .value').html(data); only displays the first part  - ??? (of a sample string "Ken <em class="saved">(change...
[00:20:12] <Hilton> ...saved)</em>", only "Ken" gets shown)
[00:20:40] <Hilton> WHY ? ? ? .html() should insert the full string it is provided, shouldn't it?
[00:22:56] <Hilton> Oooo
[00:22:58] <Hilton> nevermind
[00:23:00] <Hilton> eh heh.
[00:37:47] <Braden`> Hello
[00:37:56] <Braden`> var $inputs = $form.find("input, select, button, textarea"); <-- How would I output the contents of that?
[00:39:22] <Hilton> define "the contents"? The values? The HTML?
[00:39:37] <Hilton> name/value pairs?
[00:39:39] <Braden`> At this point, anything that is stored in the vars
[00:39:47] <Braden`> in the var rather
[00:39:53] <Braden`> The values of the inputs
[00:39:58] <Braden`> The names of the inputs
[00:40:03] <Braden`> etc.
[00:41:17] <Hilton> $inputs.each(function(){ alert($(this).attr('name') + ' => ' + $(this).val(); });
[00:41:20] <Hilton> That should get you started.
[00:45:00] <systemfault> .serializeArray() might help also.
[00:47:27] <Braden`> Well
[00:47:31] <Braden`> I use serializeArray()
[00:47:40] <Braden`> err no
[00:47:47] <Braden`> I use serializeData()
[00:47:53] <Braden`> jdksgt
[00:47:57] <Braden`> $form.serialize()
[00:48:06] <Braden`> Hilton:  Thank you
[00:48:24] <Hilton> Don't thank me, I'm useless. :P
[00:49:32] <Braden`> All of my attr('name') is appearing as undefined
[00:49:33] <Braden`> hmm
[00:49:37] <Braden`> nm, I know why
[00:50:06] <scorpx> so why?
[00:50:48] <scorpx> why undefined?
[00:51:12] <scorpx> how i can get the src attribute of a img tag?
[00:51:26] <scorpx> why this doesnt work? :
[00:51:26] <aMoniker> $('img').attr('src')
[00:52:05] <scorpx> $("#myimage").attr("src") returns undefined.
[00:52:21] <aMoniker> what does $('#myimage') return?
[00:52:23] <scorpx> (using jQuery 1.7.x)
[00:52:31] <scorpx> but the img has src defined in markup
[00:52:38] <Hilton> Are you sure it has an ID?
[00:52:41] <scorpx> (Object)
[00:53:00] <Hilton> Use Firebug and type $('#myimage'); in the console, and put your mouse over the result. It should highlight your image.
[00:53:14] <scorpx> everything works well, but just this attr function  . .
[00:53:58] <scorpx> the return value of $(...) is correct, i can do anything with it...
[00:54:07] <Braden`> If I am submitting text via ajax, is this the correct encoding?  --> application/x-www-form-urlencoded
[00:54:20] <scorpx> but using the attr to get it's attributes fails.
[00:54:44] <Hilton> I was going to test it on my own site I have open, then realized I've got no img tags anywhere. :P Nice clean text/css layout. Eh heh.
[00:55:23] <aMoniker> no images makes a boring site ;)
[00:56:48] <Hilton> Yes well, it's an internal company site and it looks quite nice. :)
[00:57:01] <Braden`> POST scripts.php  Aborted  domain.tld  0 B  127.0.0.1:8   <--- Why does my POST come back as Aborted?
[00:57:12] <HexSquid> So you can see the src attribute in the dom inspector?
[00:57:20] <HexSquid> Is there a value in it?
[00:57:55] <Hilton> scorpx: Not sure what the problem is. I just ran this in console: $('body').append('<img src="img/ajax-loader.gif" id="myImage" />'); $('#myImage').attr('src');
[00:58:00] <Hilton> and got a result of "img/ajax-loader.gif"
[00:58:02] <scorpx> yeah, its "puzzles/preview.jpg"
[00:58:33] <aMoniker> for the record, <img> tags no longer need to self-close
[00:58:35] <HexSquid> How is it not working, exactly? Are you storing the src in a var, e.g. var src = $('#myimg').attr('src'); and checking the src variable?
[00:59:13] <Braden`> Anyone?
[00:59:19] <Hilton> aMoniker: Habit. I jumped into XHTML the moment it came out so I could avoid all the hassle with all the other dozen standards.
[00:59:30] <scorpx> yeah, it's undefined... and Opera's error console show that undefined
[00:59:55] <aMoniker> scorpx: Opera: there's your first problem
[01:00:33] <HexSquid> Braden that should be fine
[01:00:47] <scorpx> aMoniker: why? "bad support" ? or things like that?
[01:01:08] <aMoniker> scorpx: really buggy browser
[01:01:11] <HexSquid> Not sure whats up with ur POST
[01:01:19] <Hilton> Braden`: Using Firebug? Check the Console for more information (expand the POST line and check Headers, Post, response, etc).
[01:01:24] <Hilton> Might give you a clue as to the abort.
[01:02:15] <Braden`> Hilton:  Ok
[01:02:19] <scorpx> another problem... how i can bind an event to a specific object, and pass arguments to it?
[01:02:48] <Hilton> Or add this to your ajax call: error: function(jqHXR, status, error) { alert(status + ': ' + error); } -- "abort" is one of the status codes, maybe it will give you a reason.
[01:03:04] <scorpx> (like $('#button').click(myfunc, {foo: 0, bar: 1});
[01:04:41] <scorpx> in other word... how to pass arguments to a event handler?
[01:04:58] <Braden`> http://pastebin.com/eEpNWzX2 <-- firebug output
[01:06:28] <aMoniker> Braden`: what are the response headers?
[01:06:29] <Braden`> Hilton:  How do I attach that function to my $.fail() ?
[01:06:59] <Braden`> response headers?
[01:07:34] <Hilton> Braden`: Firebug's POST info (under Console) will show you Request Header and Response Headers (scroll down). Also if you click "Response" you will see what the server sent back.
[01:07:47] <Hilton> You only pasted Request Headers.
[01:09:12] <raj> there was a rich text editor library that was all the hype a few months back
[01:09:16] <raj> does anyone remember the name?
[01:10:01] <Braden`> The request headers are on line 4 of my paste --> http://pastebin.com/eEpNWzX2
[01:10:14] <Hilton> Braden`: The function I posted is part of the $.ajax() call, you use it as one of your options. Docs say that way is deprecated though - your .fail() call has the same three parameters, just check it!
[01:10:44] <Hilton> Braden`: As I said, you only pasted the Request Headers. There are no Response Headers, which is what would come back from the server.
[01:12:06] <Braden`> Oh.  There are no response headers because the POST was aborted according to firebug
[01:14:59] <Hilton> Are you sure .abort() isn't called somewhere? :P
[01:19:27] <Hilton> Oh sweet. I just made jquery.min.js throw a TypeError at me by calling jqXHR.getResponseHeader()
[01:22:14] <Hilton> Hmm. Okay. That's why.
[01:22:27] <Hilton> How can I determine the returned HTTP status code in $.ajax().fail() ?
[01:22:38] <Hilton> errorThrown gives me the TEXT, but I want the code.
[01:23:16] <anew> how are you guys saving sessions and keeping users logged in with ajax ?
[01:24:17] <Braden`> I never use .abort()
[01:24:20] <Braden`> Though
[01:24:37] <Braden`> When I click the submit button to submit my form, the Windows Error Reporter (windows 8) opens
[01:24:43] <Braden`> So I think firefox calls an exception
[01:25:08] <Hilton> Braden`: You've done something very wrong. Drop to CMD, DEL *.* and forget you ever started.
[01:25:40] <Hilton> Quickly, before the hellspawn are unleashed from your hard drive!
[01:30:12] <Hilton> Well, I am fairly confident my AJAX form is working very well. A little more page-specific code than I'd wanted, but that's that.
[01:31:29] <Braden`> Hilton:  :/
[01:31:56] <HexSquid> Wow you can get a windows error?
[01:31:58] <Hilton> Braden`: You need shoky to re-appear.
[01:32:06] <Hilton> Not a newb like me.
[01:32:32] <Hilton> Let us all chant together. Say his name three times and he shall appear!
[01:32:33] <Hilton> Shoky
[01:40:03] <Andrew_R> Hilton: is this running on localhost?
[01:40:42] <whatever_42> hey guys. how do i prevent my page from loading a new page cause i am using ajax? http://jsfiddle.net/HYgLL/
[01:40:44] <Hilton> Andrew_R: ? Mine? Or do you mean Braden`?
[01:41:28] <Andrew_R> my bad, Braden` is getting the crashes?
[01:41:50] <Andrew_R> if it's on his local machine and he's not getting a response, then I would look at that code first, not the jquery call
[01:43:28] <Andrew_R> whatever_42: your return false; was in the wrong spot: http://jsfiddle.net/HYgLL/1/
[01:43:51] <whatever_42> i see. thank you
[02:38:13] <djQuery> bored
[02:39:19] <aMoniker> djQuery: If you're bored, then you're boring :)
[02:39:40] <djQuery> nah its just 4:30 am
[02:40:25] <aMoniker> so?
[02:50:52] <anew> djquery anything good for using sessions with ajax
[02:51:17] <anew> if the site is entirely loaded with js
[02:57:02] <Kambfhase> Does anyone see a good way to DRY this code? http://jsfiddle.net/fTsbK/
[03:41:30] <topriddy> tips on how to set a forms action url from jquery please?
[03:42:20] <aMoniker> topriddy: $('form').attr('action', 'url');
[03:49:10] <xiaoy> Which ide gives best jquery autocompletition code support? I'm using aptana, but the code complete support is not amazing...
[03:51:02] <craigrich> Sublime 2 Xiaoy
[03:51:59] <xiaoy> craigrich, you mean sublime text editor 2?
[03:52:06] <craigrich> yep
[03:52:25] <bluesm> How to select the same "class combination" elements
[03:52:52] <xiaoy> craigrich, the jquery support is included by default, or i have to enable it manually or by downloading some plugin?
[03:52:59] <bluesm> Where the "element" have "className"  equal "start hour"
[03:55:17] <craigrich> Sublime has a jquery linter (error checking) out the box, for jquery code completion, it requires a plugin. luckily it's very easy to install plugins for sublime
[03:55:44] <xiaoy> craigrich, thatk you very much, very helpful ;)
[03:56:20] <air_> xiaoy: you could try webstorm as well, I think they might be pretty good these days.
[03:56:30] <air_> http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/
[03:56:43] <xiaoy> air_, thank you :)
[03:57:02] <air_> (I use IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, and that one is great. Webstorm is basically just a limited version of it optimized for js devs.)
[03:57:34] <air_> you won't get the extreme response as sublime gives, but instead, you get a fully featured IDE.
[03:58:41] <air_> xiaoy: see for example http://blog.jetbrains.com/webide/2012/08/tips-on-jquery-development-in-webstorm/
[03:59:34] <xiaoy> air_, thanks, i'm checking it out...
[04:00:00] <air_> "By the way, you can instantly have all the official docs for any jQuery function in context just by using External documentation action (Shift+F1):"
[04:00:14] <air_> that said, I do love sublime as well. :)
[04:13:14] <idragon> hello could help with my script problem
[04:13:59] <jost> idragon: Ask your question, don't ask to ask
[04:14:29] <idragon> oh ok
[04:14:38] <idragon> I used a chat plugin
[04:15:02] <idragon> named jquery-ui chatbox and as I was implementing it initially it works
[04:15:21] <idragon> but if I click in other users
[04:15:33] <idragon> the chatbox displays the right name
[04:15:44] <bluesm> can I assign property to every element in collection ?
[04:15:44] <idragon> but doesn't append the messages correctly
[04:16:16] <topriddy> aMoniker: thanks...figured it out
[04:18:17] <air_> idragon: try putting it in jsfiddle, kinda hard to understand your thoughts here.
[04:21:18] <idragon> here air_ http://jsfiddle.net/2nxJg/
[04:22:18] <air_> can you make a working example of it?
[04:22:48] <bluesm> Why in ".each"   we can pass "value" parameter
[04:22:59] <bluesm> If we can acquire value by "this" keyword ?
[04:27:21] <air_> idragon: for example, add the right jquery, include external resources if you need them, strip the php code from the example so it can be tested in jsfiddle, etc.
[04:27:36] <air_> idragon: I suppose you use an old jquery version, as .live() is deprecatd.
[04:28:08] <idragon> sorry I did not know it's already deprecated...
[04:28:56] <air_> idragon: you can easily convert it to .on()
[04:29:01] <Kambfhase> bluesm: sometimes `this` differs from the `value`.
[04:29:39] <bluesm>  Kambfhase: When ?
[04:30:18] <Kambfhase> If you iterate over an array of numbers. `this` is always an object, whereas `value` is the plain number.
[04:32:06] <idragon> i'm using jquery-1.8.3.min.js tho ?
[04:37:22] <air_> idragon: the last one that still has support for live (as you probably read on jquery site). I'd rather replace it at as you are debugging, instead of waiting for it to break when you need to upgrade jquery in the future.
[04:37:53] <idragon> ok thanks for the reminder
[04:38:01] <idragon> going back to the problem tho
[04:38:03] <air_> idragon: anyway, you need to try and make the jsfiddle runnable.
[04:38:24] <air_> just add some dummy content in html to avoid the php needs.
[04:38:44] <air_> and include required jquery version + any possible external javascripts.
[04:41:09] <Kambfhase> Does anyone see a good way to DRY this code? http://jsfiddle.net/fTsbK/ (2nd try)
[04:44:24] <djQuery> Kambfhase, first change wrapper.find('.chaptertoggle').on('click.podlovewebplayer',
[04:45:05] <djQuery> to wrapper.on('click', '.chaptertoggle', 'click.podlovewebplayer'
[04:47:14] <Kambfhase> what is *faster*, having multiple handlers on different elements or all handlers delegated on one element?
[04:47:34] <djQuery> Kambfhase, well how many wrappers are you going to have?
[04:47:40] <Kambfhase> Anyways, I am more interested in makin that code more readable.
[04:47:56] <Kambfhase> Not more than a dozen per page.
[04:48:07] <Kambfhase> problably 2--4 avg
[04:49:07] <djQuery> well you could make it to were there was just $(document).on('click', '.wrapper whatever
[04:49:14] <djQuery> '
[04:49:59] <djQuery> Kambfhase, seems like there should be some way to consolidate all the share buttons into 1 click
[04:50:23] <Kambfhase> Yeah, but each of that button has different behaviour :/
[04:50:56] <Kambfhase> Speed is not the issue here. I'd just like to reduce the number of code lines
[04:51:09] <djQuery> Kambfhase, 4 of them have the same stuff
[04:52:12] <Kambfhase> Nah, look closely. Those are social share buttons, so one goes to twitter, one to app.net, ... the url differs
[04:52:36] <djQuery> var shares = {gplus: function(movieurl){}, fb: function(movieurl){}, twitter: function(movieurl){}}
[04:53:37] <Kambfhase> That might work
[04:54:00] <djQuery> on('click', '.socialshare', functino(){  link = shares[$(this).data('social')](get the ruls });
[04:54:03] <djQuery> url
[04:54:56] <djQuery> but you would need to rework the links to have a data atribute or something to determine which to run
[04:55:41] <djQuery> Kambfhase, course this whole thing is getting complexe enough that I would think about turning it into a plugin
[04:55:49] <Kambfhase> adding a data attr is no problem
[04:56:14] <djQuery> but then you can have all your link stuff in one place
[04:56:34] <Kambfhase> It is a 900 line plugin. I just pasted the nasty bit.
[04:56:43] <djQuery> lol
[04:58:16] <Kambfhase> I am making a complete rewrite of that plugin. That few lines are the one I am not yet satifsfied with.
[04:58:21] <djQuery> Kambfhase, also in those links you are doing wrapper.find('.episodetitle a') multiple times
[04:58:37] <djQuery> $a = wrapper.find('.episodetitle a'); then use it multiple times
[04:58:47] <Kambfhase> oh, yeah.
[05:00:06] <Kambfhase> previously, the code was .append('<a class=".button">') like for every element, whilst the wrapper was already in the DOM.
[05:00:15] <Kambfhase> Messy to read and really slow.
[05:00:15] <djQuery> Kambfhase, would be nice if you could do   $.pluginname.defaults.social.mailto = function(url, title){}
[05:00:29] <djQuery> as well so that you could override the email template
[05:01:23] <Kambfhase> Good idea!
[05:02:53] <djQuery> Kambfhase, need help? got git?
[05:03:20] <djQuery> using widget factory?
[05:03:42] <Kambfhase> https://github.com/Kambfhase/podlove-web-player/blob/jQueryfication/podlove-web-player/podlove-web-player.js
[05:05:05] <Kambfhase> You can play with the old, not yet jQ-plugin, here: http://newz-of-the-world.com/ (the audio player)
[05:05:14] <djQuery> https://plus.google.com/u/0/113127438179392830442/posts/6GnCJema5cP
[05:07:08] <Kambfhase> Whats the widget factory? I have been following this (rather old) guideline: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[05:07:34] <djQuery> Kambfhase, its a jquery ui thing
[05:07:57] <Kambfhase> mkay. I dont usually use UI
[05:08:13] <djQuery> give this a quick glance http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide1
[05:10:17] <djQuery> Kambfhase, http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide7
[05:13:08] <Kambfhase> My pattern has most of that features already :)
[05:15:22] <djQuery> Kambfhase, https://codio.com/djQuery/fadxw
[05:15:27] <djQuery> can you hit that
[05:17:11] <Kambfhase> mkay.
[05:17:31] <djQuery> if you register we can colabratively edit it i think
[05:18:02] <Kambfhase> While I register, do you mind checking out not master, but the jQueryfication branch?
[05:18:19] <djQuery> sure
[05:18:36] <djQuery> Kambfhase, it will wind up being a new link though
[05:18:43] <Kambfhase> kk
[05:22:18] <djQuery> https://codio.com/djQuery/pod-love-web-player
[05:25:04] <Kambfhase> okay
[05:26:47] <djQuery> think I added you as admin
[05:29:45] <djQuery> Kambfhase, how do other plugins do internationalization? I see that you have a lot of text hard coded to english stuff?
[05:29:45] <djQuery> but that would be later stuff
[05:29:46] <Kambfhase> Normally you dont see the english text. Its just there for accesibility reasons
[05:30:56] <Kambfhase> Ok, i uploaded the problematic .js version.
[05:32:21] <djQuery> 5 errors now
[05:33:41] <Kambfhase> down to zero
[05:35:00] <djQuery> look at line 93 now
[05:35:07] <djQuery> dont know if that is going to work
[05:37:03] <Kambfhase> `var wrapper = $(this).closest('.podlovewebplayer_wrapper');` why not?
[05:37:34] <djQuery> Kambfhase, where ? looks good to me
[05:38:17] <djQuery> about line 224?
[05:39:48] <Kambfhase> i have the feeling that we are looking at different files. :S
[05:40:24] <Kambfhase> I am here: https://codio.com/djQuery/pod-love-web-player/tree/pod-love-web-player/podlove-web-player/podlove-web-player.js
[05:40:29] <djQuery> look at line 58 and tell me if we are looking at samve file
[05:40:43] <djQuery> clear the text on 58
[05:41:44] <djQuery> dont think it is as colobarative as I had hoped
[05:46:21] <Kambfhase> If you want something collobarative, we could simply use a pad: http://piratenpad.de/p/pwp
[05:46:28] <djQuery> Kambfhase, I don't see your edits unless I refresh and loose mine
[05:46:54] <djQuery> Kambfhase, lol if there was only a code highlighting plugin for pirate pad
[05:47:08] <Kambfhase> pff, syntax highlighting.
[05:47:29] <djQuery> i dnkt tipe sew guud
[05:48:20] <Kambfhase> there must be a site out there using etherpad which has syntaxx highlighting
[05:48:49] <djQuery> Kambfhase, been looking at the different ones listed here https://plus.google.com/u/0/113127438179392830442/posts/6GnCJema5cP
[05:54:49] <djQuery> brb
[05:58:12] <Kambfhase> plunker looks ok: http://plnkr.co/edit/?p=streamers=ftVYS9Qm3afuNfDM
[06:01:55] <djQuery> Kambfhase, but when I click on that link I get a blank one
[06:02:47] <Kambfhase> choose script.js from the left
[06:03:27] <djQuery> Kambfhase, thats just it I only have index.html
[06:03:33] <Kambfhase> :/
[06:03:47] <Kambfhase> screw this.
[06:04:17] <Kambfhase> I'll just do it old style then.
[06:04:28] <Kambfhase> At least you gave me some ideas on how to do it.
[06:04:54] <Kambfhase> Thanks for your patience!
[06:05:39] <djQuery> Kambfhase, why do you have to do $(this).closest   can't you just declare a var in the init function and then reference it in the click functions?
[06:05:57] <Kambfhase> ha, nope.
[06:06:42] <Kambfhase> I clone the wrapper. So the $(<long html>) is just a 'template'. And I dont want to reference that
[06:06:59] <djQuery> right it would be outa scope. what if yo moved all the clicks to be defined in the init then it would be in scope
[06:08:02] <Kambfhase> you mean add the handlers after the cloning?
[06:08:11] <djQuery> Kambfhase, yes
[06:08:46] <djQuery> Kambfhase, still reading the init
[06:08:54] <Kambfhase> That would result in more handlers (more memory) and I think having the HTML and the functionality in one place makes it easier to modify
[06:09:24] <djQuery> Kambfhase, I don't think it would becuase the handlers are just copied in the clone
[06:13:04] <fission6> i want to select certain divs, then parse each div's content for the following string pattern 'something@mm/dd/yy' how can i do that
[06:13:09] <Kambfhase> If you copy the handlers, they dont have any reference to the element they are bound to, except for `this`
[06:14:18] <djQuery> fission6, $('divsslector').each(function(i, elm){});
[06:14:31] <fission6> yea thats the easy part
[06:14:56] <Kambfhase> fission6: $('div').filter('.selec.tor').filter(function(){ return /^\w+@\d\d\/\d\d\/\d\d/.test( $(this).text() })
[06:15:00] <djQuery> fission6, $('divsslector').each(function(i, elm){  $(this).text().indexOf('whateverregular expression')'});
[06:15:35] <djQuery> fission6    go with what he said
[06:16:05] <fission6> i want to replace the matched text actually
[06:16:48] <djQuery> fission6, its still the same kinda thing do a google for javascript replace
[06:17:09] <fission6> ok
[06:19:27] <fission6> i need something like replace("reg", function(match) return value)
[06:21:08] <djQuery>  $('div').filter('.selec.tor').filter(function(){ return /^\w+@\d\d\/\d\d\/\d\d/.test( $(this).text() }).each(function(){ var $this = $(this); $this.text($this.text().replace();});
[06:21:17] <djQuery> what a bitch
[06:21:26] <fission6> yea
[06:21:41] <djQuery> var exp = /^\w+@\d\d\/\d\d\/\d\d/   since you will use it more than once
[06:21:59] <fission6> yea id break it all up a little emote than that
[06:22:03] <fission6> looks a little gnar
[06:22:08] <djQuery> fission6, by the way .filter(function   is realy slow
[06:22:29] <fission6> yea i wouldn't use that at all
[06:26:48] <Braden`> http://pastebin.com/nkP9yeWh <-- My AJAX POST is causing Firefox to issue an exception for some reason.  The request gets aborted.  If anyone has any insight as to what I am doing wrong, code wise, I would appreciate any insight
[06:28:52] <Kambfhase> djQuery: This is kinda what you suggested? https://github.com/Kambfhase/podlove-web-player/commit/df6d4bf95bf7982fc62083573a20ace1d9e8081f
[06:30:14] <mmlac> Is there a cleaner way than $( $("#foo")[0] )?  Slice?
[06:30:30] <Braden`> Anyone?
[06:30:43] <mmlac> let me see Braden`
[06:30:49] <Kambfhase> ?get @ mmlac
[06:30:49] <bot-t> mmlac, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[06:30:52] <Braden`> Thank you
[06:30:59] <Kambfhase> ?eq @ mmlac
[06:31:00] <bot-t> mmlac, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[06:31:18] <mmlac> Kambfhase: very much appreciated!  Thank you. (looked at traversal and could not find them :o )
[06:31:26] <Kambfhase> or in that case $('#foo').first()
[06:31:45] <Kambfhase> (you should not have multiple elements with the same ID on a page, btw)
[06:32:25] <mmlac> Kambfhase: I understand, this was just a quick example
[06:32:35] <mmlac> make a dot out of it if it calms you :P
[06:32:37] <Kambfhase> yeah, just sayin'
[06:32:38] <mmlac> ;)
[06:32:44] <Kambfhase> :)
[06:32:48] <mmlac> I know, thank you nevertheless for making me aware!
[06:33:05] <mmlac> Braden`:  is the script called on the server?
[06:33:35] <mmlac> or what exactly happens?
[06:33:47] <mmlac> as far as I can seethe request gets processed?
[06:34:05] <mmlac> set the return-data type btw
[06:34:24] <mmlac> via dataType: I think
[06:39:44] <djQuery> Kambfhase, what is the each for on line line 169?
[06:40:03] <Braden`> mmlac:  Nay
[06:40:23] <Braden`> mmlac:  It attempts to but is prevented from doing so.  There is no response.  It just calls $.fail()
[06:40:38] <mmlac> So the server does not even receive the call?  try the full URL. And make sure it's on the same domain
[06:40:39] <Braden`> But the values that $.fail() provides are null
[06:40:45] <djQuery> Kambfhase,   social[a.data('social](a.text(), a.attr('href'))
[06:40:45] <Braden`> Ok
[06:40:52] <Kambfhase> djQuery: well i want to check which property is valid selector for the element.
[06:40:56] <mmlac> and MAKE SURE the PHP gets called (printf or sth)
[06:41:22] <mmlac> Or even better look at the server log to see if the connection is received
[06:41:34] <Kambfhase> Oh, yeah. fogot about data
[06:41:36] <mmlac> the $.fail could - as I said - come from the wrong dataType
[06:42:06] <Braden`> mmlac:  You should be able to see the data type in the information I pasted.  I know it provides the encoding type
[06:42:21] <mmlac> encoding != return type
[06:42:26] <Braden`> application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
[06:42:28] <billionaire> hi all
[06:42:28] <billionaire> How i can show a message until ajax request complete?
[06:42:41] <mmlac> no I mean in the jQuery call
[06:43:01] <mmlac> tell jQuery what is returned. If the wrong dataType is returned, the call will fail
[06:43:12] <mmlac> or the call fail function will we called
[06:43:25] <Braden`> I don't think the request is being made at all.  PHP is never called.
[06:43:35] <mmlac> billionaire: just display it and hide it on completion
[06:43:48] <mmlac> Braden`:  full URLs and check server log
[06:43:57] <mmlac> and make sure same domain.
[06:43:57] <billionaire> mmlac can you show me an example about that?
[06:44:35] <djQuery> Kambfhase, a wasnt what I thought it was
[06:44:38] <mmlac> billionaire: $("#foo").html("loading"); $.ajax().complete($("#foo").html())
[06:44:56] <djQuery> Kambfhase, it is what I thunked it was
[06:45:10] <Braden`> Its the same domain
[06:45:25] <Braden`> Its my local machine, but I have it aliased to domain.tld (as specified in my hosts file)
[06:45:26] <Braden`> so
[06:45:37] <Braden`> http://domain.tld/directory/scripts.php
[06:45:40] <Braden`> Thats what I am calling
[06:45:46] <Braden`> Which works if accessed in a browser
[06:47:11] <Kambfhase> mkay
[06:47:36] <djQuery> Kambfhase, but I was getting the data from the a instead of the button itself
[06:48:31] <djQuery>  social[$(this).data('social')](a.text(), a.attr('href'))
[06:48:39] <djQuery> Kambfhase, ^^^^
[06:50:53] <Braden`> If you look at my jquery code (in the paste), does there look like there is anything wrong with it logically?
[06:53:23] <djQuery> Kambfhase, also move the encodeURI out of the individual functions, pass them to the function allready encoded
[06:56:23] <Kambfhase> hm, yeah.
[06:59:34] <Braden`> I checked the server logs.  No request is being received via AJAX
[07:02:58] <djQuery> Braden`, check the network tab of your favorite web inspector and see if was ever sent
[07:06:43] <bluesm> how to validate
[07:06:53] <bluesm> input,  when char is ineseted ?
[07:09:41] <bluesm> The only solution is to assign it to keyup
[07:09:56] <bluesm> and then if "not valid" delete last char?
[07:10:29] <djQuery> bluesm, just return false if not valid
[07:10:47] <djQuery> or is that on keydown
[07:10:50] <bluesm> djQuery: When ?
[07:13:01] <djQuery> $('.noA').on('keyDown', function(e){ if(e.which === 65){ return false;}});
[07:13:06] <djQuery> bluesm, ^^^^
[07:14:25] <bluesm> djQuery: The question is if the "keyCodes" are standarized by jquery ?
[07:14:37] <djQuery> bluesm, nope
[07:14:44] <bluesm> (I heard that the are not native the same in all browsers)
[07:15:27] <djQuery> bluesm, think they are the same # in all browsers
[07:15:35] <systemfault> I never personally had a problem with them..
[07:15:54] <djQuery> think the e.which is normalized by jquery but not sure
[07:16:33] <djQuery> bluesm, think you only have probs when looking at the special keys
[07:18:22] <djQuery> ?validate
[07:18:25] <bot-t> djQuery, Plugins/Validation/validate - jQuery Wiki - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate
[07:21:50] <Braden`> I found the problem
[07:21:56] <Braden`> It was a PHP issue, not a jquery issue
[07:22:14] <Braden`> Hard to identify though since it was an AJAX call
[07:22:21] <Braden`> Thanks for the assistance.  I appreciate it
[07:22:23] <Braden`> Good night
[07:33:56] <hateIE> has any one built a site with foundation?
[07:37:20] <Kasimir> hateIE: No I prefer bootstrap myself
[07:39:40] <hateIE> yeah i heard of that one i should try it as well
[07:40:09] <hateIE> i thought foundation is very easy to work with
[07:41:14] <Kasimir> hateIE: bootsrap is the same on my opinion, loads of good frameworks to choose from
[07:43:20] <hateIE> yeah looks very complete
[07:45:07] <hateIE> well more power to this grid idea :)
[07:50:12] <grafi> whats the difference between attr and prop?
[08:06:24] <bluesm> Why this don't work
[08:06:24] <bluesm> $('body').animate({backgroundColor:"blue"});
[08:13:17] <Kambfhase> bluesm: your need a plugin for that, since a 'color' is not a scalar that can be interpolated
[08:13:48] <bluesm> Kambfhase: There isn't easy way to do it yourself ?
[08:14:04] <bluesm> Kambfhase: 'couse I would have to fiddle with recursion, setTimeout.
[08:14:10] <bluesm> Kambfhase: And strings for css... Right ?
[08:14:19] <Kambfhase> get a plugin
[08:14:41] <bluesm> Kambfhase: Highlight Effect  in jqueryUI. Right ?
[08:14:49] <Kambfhase> yeah
[08:15:02] <Kambfhase> http://jqueryui.com/animate/
[08:21:20] <djQuery> bluesm, by the way the jquery ui team has a color plugin that extends animate to do the color
[08:21:53] <djQuery> grafi, search jquery attr vs prop and you will find plenty of docs
[08:22:07] <grafi> that involves reading
[08:22:10] <grafi> who wants that :p
[08:22:23] <bluesm> djQuery:  Kambfhase just said that :)
[08:22:35] <djQuery> ?ui.color
[08:22:36] <bot-t> djQuery, UI/Effects/animate - jQuery Wiki - The jQuery UI effects core extends the animate function to be able to animate colors as well. It's heavily used by the class transition feature and it's able to color animate the following properties: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/animate
[08:23:01] <bluesm> djQuery:   highlight Effect  in jqueryUI. Right ?
[09:01:17] <bluesm> can I create "combination of two collecitons" ?
[09:01:30] <djQuery> ?add
[09:01:30] <bot-t> .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[09:01:45] <djQuery> var x = $('someslector')
[09:02:00] <djQuery> x  = x.add('someotherselector');
[09:03:41] <bluesm>  djQuery: Hmm.
[09:03:56] <bluesm>  djQuery:  I mean  $x.add($y)
[09:04:05] <bluesm> Where x and y are jQuery collection.
[09:04:39] <bluesm> djQuery: Moment. sorry.
[09:05:36] <bluesm> djQuery: It works. Thank you very very much :)
[09:27:37] <sal002> Hello - anyone here well-versed in the tablesorter plugin?
[09:51:18] <omani_> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/236792?ln=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it!
[09:51:21] <omani_> my navbar-fixed-top does not work
[09:51:24] <omani_> any advice?
[09:52:06] <omani_> the navbar isn't fixed.
[09:52:09] <omani_> I can scroll it away
[09:55:09] <sal002> I am trying to use the tablesorter plugin here - http://www.coinchoose.com, but the fields are not sorting.
[10:15:43] <omani_> does anyone know pageslide?
[10:15:53] <omani_> how can I use pageslide to slide within a div
[10:15:56] <omani_> and not the whole site
[10:27:43] <Foxhoundz> omani_: check this one out

[10:47:47] <zuloyd> hi
[10:49:05] <zuloyd> if I have previously initiated a DOM element to be something special, e.g. $("#foo").slider(), how can I remove the slider stuff from it so that it is a normal DOM element again?
[10:50:01] <jrockjiggz> You'd have to know what the plugin does in order to reverse it's effects. Many plugins add extra elements to the DOM, handlers to elements, etc. If the plugin doesn't create any extra elements, you might be able to simply do a clone (without data and events) and replace or even just unbind all event handlers, but that's not always going to be effective. It would be very dependent on the plugin
[10:50:01] <jrockjiggz> in question.
[10:50:19] <jrockjiggz> some plugins contain an unload feature..
[10:57:25] <qom2> Trying to build a simple carousel where I have three identical divs. The active div has the class "curr", but I want to be able to show which div that is active, numerically, if that makes sense. I.e, if the first div is the active one, then a counter should say 1/3, if div 2 is active then 2/3 etc.. How do I solve this?
[10:58:33] <djQuery> ?index@qom2
[10:58:34] <bot-t> qom2, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[10:59:47] <qom2> thanks!
[11:04:53] <djQuery> zuloyd, for example jquery ui has a destroy funciton   $('selector').dialog('destroy')
[11:05:23] <zuloyd> ok thanks
[11:05:48] <superdo> hi
[11:05:55] <djQuery> zuloyd, of course where dialog= whatever ui plugin u are using
[11:06:06] <superdo> can someone help me with backbone? http://jsfiddle.net/7NbsM/198/
[11:06:56] <superdo> it should open modal dblclicking on the map
[11:07:54] <djQuery> superdo, did you notice you are getting an error in the console
[11:08:14] <superdo> maybe transfering to jsfiddle.. no
[11:11:23] <superdo> hm lol now works
[11:11:34] <superdo> jsfiddle rulz
[11:12:29] <superdo> djQuery, what should be that Object has no method "modal" ?
[11:14:35] <superdo> works on jsfiddle, but black transparent screen on laptop, nice
[11:19:58] <djQuery> superdo, no it looks like you missed a global somewhere baseurl?
[11:20:19] <superdo> ah yeah but wasnt that the error
[11:30:07] <superdo> djQuery, got it. i have a complex template with language replacements, php templates (Blade by Laravel) and thats too much for the underscore parser
[11:30:16] <superdo> so with a simple modal it works
[11:40:49] <michaelfillier> Does anyone have any insight to what would be better for performance, hotlinking jquery and jquery mobile off of the cdn, or saving it locally and combining it with my other scripts.
[11:41:30] <djQuery> cdn
[11:41:46] <Gazpacho> cdn, that way it doesn't have to be downloaded at all usually
[11:41:46] <djQuery> michaelfillier, cdn will most likely be closer to them
[11:42:26] <michaelfillier> cool, thx
[11:43:00] <Gazpacho> you know how google has been discontinuing this and that lately. wouldn't it be something if they discontinued the jquery urls. whoa
[11:48:36] <Fraxtil`> Kind of a silly question, but the way jQuery allows methods to be 'stacked', like $('.thing').first().closest('.container').fadeOut()... is there a name for that design? I thought there was but I can't seem to find it.
[11:48:57] <djQuery> Fraxtil`, its called chaining
[11:48:59] <grafi> called chaining me thinks
[11:49:05] <grafi> :o
[11:49:27] <Fraxtil`> Yep, that would be it; thank you
[11:53:31] <Selena_> If anyone is familiar with infinite scrolling and masonry please reply
[11:54:43] <Selena_> Anyone worked before with MASONRY?
[11:55:42] <beachandbytes> no looks pretty cool tho
[11:56:02] <j_wright> that the 'pinterest' look?
[11:56:20] <beachandbytes> ya
[11:56:39] <Selena_> yes
[11:56:53] <Selena_> Exactly, the "pinterest" look n feel
[11:57:09] <Selena_> But, i am having big problems... i made it work dynamic so it fetch data from database
[11:57:26] <Selena_> So lets say each "box" gets its own data from Database.
[11:57:28] <djQuery> ?ask@selena_
[11:57:28] <bot-t> selena_, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:57:52] <Selena_> And i decided to load 20 boxes at beginning and then once i scroll down it loads other 20.
[11:58:14] <Selena_> So it worked nice, first 20 boxes are displayed nice properly but once i load for more, it loads them over the first 20..
[11:58:19] <Selena_> instead of continue down with them :|
[11:59:43] <Selena_> So anyone have any idea why is that happening
[11:59:45] <Selena_> ?
[12:00:54] <beachandbytes> would have to see some coded
[12:01:02] <beachandbytes> are you recalling the masonry method after loading?
[12:01:35] <Selena_> Yes, after i load i recall masonry
[12:01:40] <Selena_> Let me share you the code, 1 moment
[12:02:20] <beachandbytes> are you calling reload, or append?
[12:02:51] <Selena_> http://pastebin.com/jN2tWVsv
[12:03:55] <_biff> hi
[12:04:10] <Selena_> There you have the code, first i do a function that triggers the ajax.php which connects to database
[12:04:15] <_biff> what should i use for creating bank transaction on my webpage
[12:04:24] <Selena_> and generates the content
[12:05:16] <shoky> Selena_: initialize masonry only once, then after appending items do .masonry('reload')
[12:05:55] <beachandbytes> what shoky said
[12:06:18] <beachandbytes> $masonryBox = $('#yourbox').masonry({settings});
[12:06:24] <Selena_> Hm, so shall i initilaize masonry on my index.php ? then in my javascript.js i will reload it .masonry('reload') after i fetch data?
[12:06:56] <stemid> anyone here got experience with waypoints plugin? so far the only way I've managed to do a scroll to load setup with waypoints was to nestle a recursive ajax request inside a waypoint, which was inside a success callback of the first ajax request. this seems wrong, but when I have a function that loads more content with ajax, I can only ever get the waypoint to fire once and run the function one time with offset:bottom-in-view.
[12:06:58] <beachandbytes> $masonryBox.append(items).masonry('appended',items);
[12:07:08] <Selena_> Im really bad with jquery, but lets see the reaload thingy
[12:07:25] <shoky> ah yea there's the 'appended' thing too, prolly better
[12:08:01] <vrs> I've noticed that when I load a document via $.ajax() and parse the response text with $, it loads included images (and presumably executes scripts), any way to prevent this?
[12:08:22] <Selena_> Hm
[12:08:46] <vrs> a DOMParser does it without loading the images but then I might as well not use jquery
[12:09:10] <shoky> vrs:  $.parseHTML maybe
[12:09:25] <Selena_> beach can you tell me the steps exactly? I am very poor in Jquery. So what shall i do? Once i getData from the file.php? i should $masonryBox.append(items).masonry('appended',items); ?
[12:10:07] <vrs> shoky: nope loads the images
[12:10:54] <beachandbytes> Selena_ I would have to see how the return looks to tell you exactly
[12:10:59] <beachandbytes> but yes that the gist of it
[12:10:59] <vrs> code is $j.ajax('thread/6', {dataType: 'text', complete: function (xhr) {console.log($j.parseHTML(xhr.responseText))}})
[12:11:51] <Selena_> beachandbytes may i query you?
[12:11:55] <shoky> vrs: mm right. donno
[12:12:04] <beachandbytes> sure
[12:12:13] <beachandbytes> vrs, remove the stuff you don't want to load?
[12:12:30] <vrs> beachandbytes: but for that I'd have to parse it in the first place
[12:12:48] <vrs> as soon as I parse it (with jquery means), it loads the images
[12:13:16] <beachandbytes> use string replace on the img src=
[12:13:18] <beachandbytes> then parse it
[12:13:21] <shoky> well, jquery isn't an html parser
[12:13:54] <vrs> I've used domparser before, it's all nice except... opera doesn't support the text/html type for it
[12:15:17] <vrs> $j(new DOMParser().parseFromString(xhr.responseText,"text/html")) does what I want btw, but it will break in opera
[12:15:32] <beachandbytes> str = str.replace(/<img src=/gi, "<img tempSrc="); then jquery parse
[12:16:15] <vrs> I fear it executes scripts too, let me check
[12:16:34] <beachandbytes> could do same thing with script tags
[12:20:07] <vrs> ok it doesn't execute the scripts
[12:22:05] <shoky> DOMParser doesn't work for html in IE9 either

[12:31:54] <shoky> but uhh, i'd use a form or ajax so send it to the server, sure
[12:31:56] <anew> who are the security experts in here lol
[12:31:59] <shoky> over https
[12:32:11] <anew> yeah but then what about keeping tokens on other pages
[12:32:16] <anew> the whole site would have to be https wouldnt it
[12:32:56] <shoky> mm i guess?
[12:33:02] <anew> meh
[12:40:25] <anew> when u send passwords via ajax
[12:40:33] <anew> how can u send encrypted ...
[12:47:57] <Clex> anew: with  https.
[12:48:17] <anew> yes but then does every url have to be https also if the site is pushstate
[12:49:55] <Clex> anew: just the URL you're requesting with AJAX.
[12:50:10] <anew> so my client url has to be https and the server one also right
[12:52:42] <omani_> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/236803?ln=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it!
[12:52:51] <omani_> could someone have a look at this please
[12:52:54] <omani_> I can't figure it out
[12:53:07] <omani_> the error is "job_stats ... is not defined"
[12:54:03] <omani_> and job_stats itself is within the document.ready function on main page. right after donut.js is loaded
[12:54:37] <StephenS> I have widget on page, and when clicking on it it goes back to the top # why?
[12:55:01] <omani_> StephenS: isn't this a meta question?
[12:55:06] <StephenS> dunno
[12:55:12] <air_> omani_: your function job_stats is not defined until document ready is run.
[12:55:23] <air_> omani_: so it doesn't matter it's loaded before.
[12:55:27] <omani_> air_: so what do I have to do?
[12:55:47] <omani_> remove the document.ready in donut.js doesn't solve the problem
[12:55:57] <air_> omani_: it depends on your other code.
[12:56:44] <omani_> oh alright. I changed the order and removed document.ready in donut.js
[12:56:46] <omani_> now it works.
[12:56:53] <air_> :)
[12:59:09] <StephenS> omani_, what to do?
[12:59:43] <JLT> Is there a "function summary" url? I'm making an IRC bot (not for here) and I want to add in something like !jquery function_name, andi t'll look it up.
[13:03:15] <omani_> StephenS: that is like asking: "I have a car and when I get in it, it makes a weird sound."
[13:05:21] <air_> omani_: more like "when I get out of my car I'm on the same place as when I got in, why is that" :D
[13:06:55] <StephenS> hmm
[13:07:33] <air_> StephenS: jsfiddle it if possible.
[13:09:11] <wroathe> omani_: StephenS has a history of providing very little information and not asking the right questions.
[13:17:39] <TopHatHacker> hey folks
[13:36:17] <alwayslearning> can anyone help me figure out why my script won't modify the CSS inside this iframe?? http://jsfiddle.net/pPqGe/1492/
[13:37:02] <TopHatHacker> leme look, just a sec
[13:38:14] <TopHatHacker> your css tag
[13:38:29] <TopHatHacker> should be more like .css({'display':'none'})
[13:38:57] <TopHatHacker> with a comma seperating each item so {'display':'none','background-color':'white'}
[13:39:53] <Andrew_R> TopHatHacker: his syntax is correct for a single CSS change
[13:40:01] <TopHatHacker> ok
[13:40:11] <TopHatHacker> i've never done it like that
[13:40:17] <chipnt> hi everyone. How do I implement the onchange event on the all select fields of a specific parent id?
[13:40:17] <Andrew_R> alwayslearning: you are running into cross-domain permissions
[13:40:32] <Andrew_R> my firebug console window shows: Error: Permission denied to access property 'nodeType'
[13:40:42] <alwayslearning> @Andrew_R i see, that seems like the likely culprit
[13:40:43] <Andrew_R> basically, you can't edit the document in the iframe because it's on a different domain
[13:41:00] <alwayslearning> got it but if i take it off jsfiddle and put it on the same domain it should work?
[13:41:43] <Andrew_R> yeah I think so
[13:42:55] <Andrew_R> instead of $(document).ready you may need to use $('iframe').load to bind an event to the onLoad event of the iframe
[13:43:44] <alwayslearning> i'l try that
[13:44:53] <TopHatHacker> do you mean $('iframe').on('load', functionname)? i don't think $('iframe').load will work the way you're wanting it to
[13:45:44] <TopHatHacker> http://api.jquery.com/load/ is something different than a bind event
[13:45:45] <Andrew_R> If you pass a function in it does, I have code that does $iframe.load(function(){ // do stuff }); -- works fine
[13:46:14] <TopHatHacker> hmm alright, i think the on('load', function) syntax might be better practice.. moving forward with jquery api at least
[13:46:19] <Andrew_R> http://api.jquery.com/load-event/ -- apparently it is depreciated though
[13:46:32] <Andrew_R> you are right .on('load', function) is probably better
[13:46:47] <TopHatHacker> the .on has better results cross browser too
[13:47:44] * Andrew_R edits code to use .on('load', function) instead of .load(function)
[13:47:53] <TopHatHacker> :P
[13:48:41] <TopHatHacker> hey alwayslearning, try.jquery.com is worth a few minutes of your time.. has alot of the new 'correct practices' for the newest jquery api
[13:49:18] <TopHatHacker> also codestudio.com 's chrome debug console course is worth it too... the console in chrome is powerful if  you use it well
[13:49:26] <alwayslearning> i'll definitely pore over all the new changes after this project :P
[13:49:49] <alwayslearning> and get that debug console as well
[13:49:51] <TopHatHacker> fair enough, i understand getting a project done then caring about 'correct practice' later :P
[13:50:26] <TopHatHacker> if you're curious if your $('') selector tag is working, just throw that in the console quick.. it should return all objects that selector matches
[14:01:24] <alwayslearning> hey guys so i'm trying to get it work on this domain: http://butterlane.com/butterlanedev/store/
[14:01:33] <alwayslearning> when i enter the code in the console it works fine
[14:01:48] <alwayslearning> any ideas?
[14:02:20] <TopHatHacker> same code as before?
[14:03:28] <Andrew_R> change $(document).ready(function) to $('iframe').on('load', function)
[14:03:36] <alwayslearning> actually i edited it to include the .on load function
[14:03:43] <alwayslearning> and it works now, thanks guys!
[14:03:44] <Andrew_R> I'm not seeing that
[14:03:48] <Andrew_R> oh ok
[14:04:00] <Andrew_R> yep, your code was running before iframe had finished loading
[14:04:27] <alwayslearning> indeed and you caught that beforehand, much appreciated
[14:06:13] <TopHatHacker> now i want a cupcake
[14:07:33] <Andrew_R> alwayslearning: is there anyway you can remove that header_in section on the server side? would give a better user experience
[14:08:10] <alwayslearning> @Andrew_R that was what i've been trying to do for the past 2 days but i can't output what i need from the WooCommerce plugin
[14:08:22] <TopHatHacker> or at least throw in display:none in a css, otherwise it could flash if the javascript loads slow
[14:08:24] <Andrew_R> maybe add a parameter to the url, like http://butterlane.com/butterlanedev/shop/vanilla-on-chocolate-4/?iframe=true
[14:08:27] <alwayslearning> ideally i'd like to display that product view from the template
[14:09:07] <Andrew_R> yeah, some of the premade solutions are hard to find where to put code and make changes
[14:09:16] <alwayslearning> what does that parameter do?
[14:09:41] <Andrew_R> you'd have to have code check if the parameter is there, and if it is, don't include that header section
[14:11:46] <alwayslearning> you're a great bunch over here in #jquery, i always find the most help here
[14:12:03] <Andrew_R> I don't know anything about WooCommerce... do you have a "product template" and are you only loading product pages in the iframe?
[14:12:27] <Andrew_R> if so, add <style>#header_in{display:none;}</style> to that template and you shouldn't need the jquery
[14:13:17] <alwayslearning> that's a good point
[14:17:11] <anthonyjonez> hello
[14:17:17] <TopHatHacker> howdy!
[14:17:23] <TopHatHacker> ... sorry, too much coffee
[14:17:40] <anthonyjonez> :D
[14:17:44] <anthonyjonez> here's one question
[14:18:40] <anthonyjonez> there is a website that adds a flash object into a website using jquery and then reads some parameters from it
[14:19:01] <TopHatHacker> that seems like more of a statement :P
[14:19:06] <anthonyjonez> wait :P
[14:19:27] <anthonyjonez> how could i simulate this myself (i can't do it because of adobe's origin policies)?
[14:19:54] <anthonyjonez> basically, this flash object can't be accessed if request doesn't come from that domain
[14:20:14] <TopHatHacker> do you have this code in action somewhere? somewhere we could look at the origin error?
[14:20:32] <anthonyjonez> please wait
[14:22:51] <anthonyjonez> do you mind if i pm you the link?
[14:25:38] <TopHatHacker> ya i have no experience with adobe anthonyjonez
[14:26:27] <anthonyjonez> i have a few more questions not related to flash
[14:26:32] <anthonyjonez> will pm you
[14:26:40] <TopHatHacker> your best bet is to ask them here
[14:26:56] <anthonyjonez> okay
[14:27:17] <anthonyjonez> so basically, website adds this flash object into a website
[14:27:50] <anthonyjonez> then it sets variable t's value to document.getelementbyid(that flash object)
[14:28:08] <anthonyjonez> then it calls t.function
[14:28:16] <anthonyjonez> but that function can't be located anywhere in the script
[14:28:28] <anthonyjonez> how's that?
[14:29:48] <TopHatHacker> ... ya i'm having trouble following you i guess
[14:29:57] <anthonyjonez> it's pretty complex
[14:30:54] <TopHatHacker> well it doesn't seem too complex, just specific... code examples would help.
[14:31:53] <anthonyjonez> could we speak in private, i want to explain this problem in depth?
[14:32:23] <TopHatHacker> here is fine
[14:52:48] <harrydog> the docs say .live is deprecated, but .on doesn't seem to attach event listeners to html loaded through ajax. any clues?
[14:53:13] <TopHatHacker> what ajax method?
[14:54:07] <harrydog> .load
[14:54:07] <b-ot> harrydog: like an .get but with the possibility to choose section to load (like with anchor)
[14:56:30] <TopHatHacker> you can throw a function in the second param of the .load
[14:58:54] <harrydog> ya, i can keep reattaching the listeners with the callback function in .load, though wasn't sure if there was an easier way like .live() where it attaches to event listenrs to elements now and in the future
[14:59:12] <TopHatHacker> .live is depreciated
[14:59:40] <Foxhoundz> TopHatHacker: ...what?!
[14:59:46] <Foxhoundz> then what's the alternative?
[14:59:51] <TopHatHacker> http://api.jquery.com/live/
[15:00:10] <TopHatHacker> .on('load',fucntion) is the correct way to do it
[15:00:34] <callista> hi all
[15:00:38] <TopHatHacker> hello callista
[15:00:49] <Foxhoundz> ah
[15:00:55] <Foxhoundz> it also suggests .delegate()
[15:00:57] <Foxhoundz> which I never used before
[15:01:10] <TopHatHacker> well delegate is old too actually
[15:01:11] <Foxhoundz> you can filter specific elements within the select elements to trigger the event
[15:01:13] <TopHatHacker> .on is the way to do it
[15:01:15] <Foxhoundz> oh
[15:01:47] <TopHatHacker> .delegate isn't depreciated, but has been superseded by .on http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[15:02:08] <callista> can someone help me with this? $('button.nav-toggle, #mobile-button button').on('click',function(e){ --functions here--} ---> I dont understand $('button.nav-toggle,#mobile-button button')... why is itseparated by comma?
[15:02:22] <callista> hi tophathatcker
[15:02:46] <Gazpacho> refer to the selector syntax docs
[15:02:56] <harrydog> so, other than applying more event listeners after new content is loaded, there's no way to add events to current elements in the DOM and one's that get added later?
[15:03:09] <Gazpacho> oh god, fuckin w3schools can't even leave jquery alone
[15:03:21] <Gazpacho> sorry, i forgot where i was
[15:03:53] <TopHatHacker> harrydog have you tried on('changed',function) ?
[15:04:11] <harrydog> on what changed, you mean like apply it to the document?
[15:04:44] <Gazpacho> callista: a comma in selector syntax means "or"
[15:04:47] <harrydog> i can re-add the event listeners in the callback function for .load(), but that's not what i was going for
[15:04:55] <TopHatHacker> events don't go away unless you use .remove() on an element
[15:05:07] <TopHatHacker> so if your selector is correct, it should work after a reload
[15:05:14] <callista> gazpacho thank youuuuu ^_^
[15:05:26] <harrydog> i'm loading new content via .load() calls
[15:05:55] <TopHatHacker> and events don't follwo?
[15:07:38] <harrydog> no, with .live() they do, but not with .on()
[15:07:51] <harrydog> this is when i assign the event listener before the content is loaded
[15:07:52] <TopHatHacker> interesting..
[15:17:24] <TopHatHacker> harrydog might i suggest learning something like backbone.js? keeping events out of your html and generating html with  a view would solve your event problems
[15:18:11] <harrydog> i have my js file separate from my html file
[15:19:05] <Gazpacho> good
[15:19:19] <TopHatHacker> "your client side javascript is staring to mold"
[15:19:43] <TopHatHacker> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyCUFrTZ6pc
[15:19:48] <TopHatHacker> i love the jingle :P
[15:22:45] <anew> tophathacker are you using backbone.js ?
[15:22:58] <TopHatHacker> i do on a few projects, ya
[15:23:08] <anew> how are you handling sessions and logins ?
[15:23:09] <TopHatHacker> after you wrap your head around how it works.. you can make apps really fast
[15:23:19] <anew> been looking all day on how to do that for my app
[15:23:24] <anew> just have a ton of questions on it
[15:24:15] <TopHatHacker> hmm well this is a jquery room, is there a backbone.js room?
[15:24:28] <anew> yeah i asked in there already, or you can PM me
[15:24:58] <TopHatHacker> meh if nobody minds we can chat about it here
[15:25:08] <anew> ok
[15:25:36] <anew> i mean first i have routes setup to all go to /home, but if i need to login or register with https ... then i'd have to do a page refresh on both of these pages
[15:25:43] <anew> or - make the entire site https
[15:25:46] <anew> which doesnt seem logical
[15:25:53] <TopHatHacker> why not?
[15:26:01] <anew> make the whole site https ??
[15:26:04] <TopHatHacker> ya
[15:26:06] <TopHatHacker> why not?
[15:26:13] <DonRichie> google did it, too
[15:26:28] <anew> well, just didnt think it was the correct option
[15:26:31] <anew> is that what you have ?
[15:26:45] <TopHatHacker> i only use https if i have credit card stuff
[15:26:55] <anew> yeah but say you have a 'browse' page
[15:27:02] <anew> how do you go from https login to browse ...
[15:27:07] <anew> without a page refresh
[15:27:10] <anew> u cant
[15:27:18] <Kolorbon> Hello ;)  I know, the jQuery-getJSON function is asynchronous. How can i use this function as a return-function, or, how can i save its returned value in a variable, to use it outside for other things?
[15:27:19] <TopHatHacker> just go https from the start
[15:27:30] <anew> meh yeah ok i guess that is the solution
[15:27:40] <anew> so then for login/registration are you just doing normal ajax
[15:27:48] <anew> or are you doing it with backbone functions
[15:27:57] <TopHatHacker> kolorbon pass in a function when you call $.getJSON(url,function)
[15:28:39] <TopHatHacker> kolorbon: and it'll be something like $.getJSON('url.php',function(data){console.log(data);});
[15:28:56] <Kolorbon> I do but when i write "return data", then data is undefined.
[15:30:12] <TopHatHacker> anew i don't use https for a normal website if it's small and i don't need credit card stuff
[15:30:18] <TopHatHacker> otherwise, https the whole way
[15:30:28] <TopHatHacker> and have http resolve to https from the start
[15:30:39] <anew> well https should be used for register/login even with no cc shouldnt it ?
[15:30:51] <TopHatHacker> 'should' and 'does' are different :P
[15:31:03] <anew> ok
[15:31:03] <TopHatHacker> ya if you have the option you should but most people dont' want to pay for an https cert
[15:31:19] <anew> will use https, there is a subscribe option so just better safe than sorry
[15:31:26] <anew> where do you start the login ? before your routes ?
[15:31:34] <anew> *session check i mean
[15:31:41] <Kolorbon> TopHatHacker, http://jsfiddle.net/Kolorbon/JrbYh/1/
[15:31:43] <TopHatHacker> login is it's own route and i use ajax to log in
[15:31:51] <anew> checking if user is authenticated or not for each page
[15:32:37] <anew> when do u check for authentication? before the routes.js file ?
[15:33:19] <TopHatHacker> kolorbon do you need to do JSON.parse? if the json coming back is formated right it should be usable as is
[15:34:03] <Kolorbon> It is not usable, parse is needed.
[15:34:39] <TopHatHacker> anew all depends.. but client side you only need to check the authentication token once per page refresh, then pass the authentication token when you get anything ajax wise
[15:34:56] <TopHatHacker> do you have an example json? can you go to that url manually?
[15:35:12] <anew> hmmm but there are no page refreshes i thought
[15:35:21] <TopHatHacker> right
[15:35:25] <anew> oh
[15:35:26] <anew> i think i see
[15:35:30] <TopHatHacker> but the user 'could' refresh the page
[15:35:35] <anew> so u just check once unless there is a page refresh
[15:35:36] <anew> hmmm
[15:35:39] <TopHatHacker> and you would have to check that token (that you've sade via session variable)
[15:36:00] <Kolorbon> TopHatHacker, no, you have to be logged in, to see that. Login data -> query.
[15:36:12] <TopHatHacker> right, but to get more data via ajax for other pages you have to pass that session token to the server, otherwise you could get any data you want
[15:36:43] <TopHatHacker> kolorbon i can't really debug your code unless i can see what the json looks like.
[15:36:56] <anew> did you find any good tuts for it, or just figure it out on ur own
[15:37:10] <TopHatHacker> codeschool.com has some great backbone.js tutorials
[15:37:17] <anew> cool will check that out
[16:02:39] <Kolorbon> TopHatHacker, console.log(getResearchProcent(function(type){return type;})); When I have this, I get returned "undefined".
[16:03:12] <TopHatHacker> did you change the return statement from getResearchProcent?
[16:03:34] <Kolorbon> Yes.
[16:03:49] <TopHatHacker> make a new jsfiddle or whatever so i can see the new code
[16:04:05] <Kolorbon> http://jsfiddle.net/Kolorbon/JrbYh/2/
[16:05:16] <TopHatHacker> dont' return type
[16:05:21] <TopHatHacker> just console.log(type)
[16:05:25] <TopHatHacker> inside the function
[16:05:47] <Kolorbon> But I need a return function
[16:06:23] <TopHatHacker> why?
[16:06:50] <TopHatHacker> since you're passing in a function now, do whatever you need to do other than console.log in that function
[16:06:57] <TopHatHacker> can be different every time you call it
[16:07:50] <Kolorbon> I have another function in which I need type, and I just can get type with getJSON. So I want type returned, to do this for example: function other(){ alert(value/(getResearchProcent());}
[16:08:26] <TopHatHacker> you'll have to do getResearchProcent(function(type){alert(type);});
[16:08:46] <Kolorbon> But I need value/type...
[16:08:50] <TopHatHacker> you can't wait on a value that's async.. you have to change your mindset to think async :P
[16:09:07] <Kolorbon> And value/type is saved in another variable..
[16:09:13] <TopHatHacker> there's no longer a clear chain of events.. otherwise that async call would be blocking..
[16:09:59] <Kolorbon> Look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/Kolorbon/JrbYh/3/
[16:13:07] <TopHatHacker2> $.on('typechanged', dosomething) and then inside the async call run $.trigger('typechanged') inside your async call at the end
[16:13:50] <Kolorbon> What has that to do with the json-function?
[16:14:11] <TopHatHacker2> nothing, its the async that you're having trouble understanding
[16:14:39] <Kolorbon> I just want to use it that way, you see in the newest fiddle.
[16:14:49] <TopHatHacker> i do see the newest fiddle
[16:14:54] <TopHatHacker> and it won't work that way
[16:15:06] <TopHatHacker> that's what i'm trying to say.. you're missing the key point of an asyncronous call
[16:15:10] <Gazpacho> there is no such thing as a "procent"
[16:15:31] <TopHatHacker> ha yes gazpacho
[16:16:06] <Kolorbon> Procent... Percent... German... English, does not matter :P
[16:16:20] <aMoniker> http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procent
[16:16:23] <TopHatHacker> if that call wasn't asyncronous.. and returned a value like you want it would halt your application until the network stuff was all done
[16:17:11] <aMoniker> Gazpacho: There is a such thing.
[16:17:20] <TopHatHacker> what is happening with all these quit/joins?
[16:17:20] <Kolorbon> TopHatHacker, ok... But can you say me please: Is it possible to write it in the way I need, or not?
[16:17:36] <TopHatHacker> no kolorbon, not the way you expect it to happen.
[16:17:43] <Auger1> I have an absolute positioned div on my page called #character
[16:17:50] <Auger1> and it moves around with arrow keys
[16:17:50] <Gazpacho> amoniker: no
[16:17:55] <aMoniker> Gazpacho: http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procent
[16:18:02] <Kolorbon> And how can I then get the value, to use it in the other function?
[16:18:02] <Auger1> but when i alt tab i lose focus and i can't move it around
[16:18:15] <Gazpacho> amoniker: you're a dummy
[16:18:16] <TopHatHacker> in that callback function kolorbon
[16:18:17] <Auger1> i have this but it is not returning focus
[16:18:21] <Auger1> can someone tell me what's wrong with this ?
[16:18:22] <Auger1> http://pastebin.com/gyZcaJnc
[16:18:22] <aMoniker> Gazpacho: Did you click that link?
[16:19:04] <Kolorbon> TopHatHacker, so I need to take the callback function together with reduceByPercent?
[16:19:06] <Auger1> i switched to jquery ui dialogs
[16:19:12] <Auger1> it worked when i did it as an alert
[16:19:17] <Auger1> but an alert won't let me switch between windows
[16:19:27] <anew> tophathacker if u use an irc client you wont see all the quit/joins
[16:19:30] <Auger1> any help would be appreciated, thanks
[16:19:31] <TopHatHacker> kolorbon you need to change the sequence of events in your app
[16:19:35] <anew> much easier to read what people say that way
[16:19:38] <TopHatHacker> i do use an irc client anew
[16:19:46] <Kolorbon> TopHatHacker, how?
[16:20:10] <TopHatHacker> i have no idea kolorbon, that you'll have to figure out. I've given you a tool to use in your quest.. go forth and code.
[16:20:11] <anew> lol
[16:21:17] <Kolorbon> TopHatHacker, if you mean RESTClient... The JSON is not mine! I just write a GreaseMonkey-Script that uses this JSON!
[16:22:05] <TopHatHacker> ya there must be a language barier here.. you need to put all of your code INSIDE the callback of your getjson call. do everything when you know you've got the json data.
[16:22:30] <TopHatHacker> call the getJSON RIGHT AWAY in your script, then do everything else inside that callback
[16:23:42] <JohnMcLear> Is it possible for jQuery or Javascript to modify the value 600 in this Media jquery? media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
[16:24:36] <aMoniker> JohnMcLear: Not to my knowledge.
[16:24:40] <Kolorbon> TopHatHacker, but reduceByPercent is also a return-function, so that is useless, when the callback function returns smth to the json-function.
[16:25:03] <JohnMcLear> is it possible to apply the rule without modifying the screen width?
[16:25:32] <aMoniker> JohnMcLear: You could duplicate the rule in jQuery. Not elegant, but it works.
[16:26:14] <aMoniker> or duplicate it as a class in css, add the class in jquery
[16:28:44] <Chillance> so, I was looking at jquery.yiigridview.js and saw this: $(updateId).replaceWith($(updateId, $data)); what does the $(updateId, $data) part do exactly?
[16:29:28] <Chillance> otherwise it would make more sense to me with: $(updateId).replaceWith($data);
[16:29:43] <TopHatHacker> well that inner part is a selector
[16:30:15] <Kolorbon> TopHatHacker, so can you help me now please to solve this?
[16:31:12] <Chillance> TopHatHacker, so, it will try to find something that matches $(updateId, $data) in the DOM? that doesnt make sense to me
[16:31:30] <TopHatHacker> well, do you know what $data is?
[16:31:41] <Chillance> yes, var $data = $('<div>' + data + '</div>');
[16:31:51] <Chillance> and data is result from the ajax call
[16:31:57] <TopHatHacker> i believe $data is the context
[16:32:02] <TopHatHacker> telling it what 'this' is
[16:32:21] <Chillance> well, I dont get it
[16:32:38] <TopHatHacker> dont' worry about the context
[16:32:55] <TopHatHacker> you can get around it, by casting things explicityly but giving a context helps make methods more dynamic
[16:33:09] <TopHatHacker> so inside you would use $(this) and that is actually refereing to $data
[16:33:41] <Chillance> well, the problem I have is that what I output from my ajax call isn't inserted where I was expecting
[16:34:02] <Chillance> basically, it comes out as empty
[16:34:34] <Chillance> so, I guess the data must contain something more to make this work and not just whatever new data I want?
[16:34:57] <TopHatHacker> well it shouldnt' be empty, it's a jquery object
[16:35:21] <TopHatHacker> it's just how jQuery handles selectors
[16:35:36] <TopHatHacker> you could take it off and it 'should' work.. depends on how the replace was written
[16:35:46] <Chillance> well, Im just saying that I do a testoutput of some '<div>adfasdf</div>', but that doesnt show up
[16:36:06] <Chillance> I'm now suspecting that I need to have a "copy" of the original "context" so this line of code works
[16:36:09] <TopHatHacker> ... are you  just trying to understand replaceWith? or are you debugging some code... maybe we should back up
[16:36:40] <Chillance> well, I was trying to understand $(updateId).replaceWith($(updateId, $data));
[16:37:01] <Chillance> because I was expecting more of: $(updateId).replaceWith($data); there
[16:37:32] <TopHatHacker> just a sec chillance
[16:38:01] <TopHatHacker> did you read through this? http://api.jquery.com/replacewith/
[16:38:40] <TopHatHacker> $(updateId) should work fine, depends on where you're using it
[16:38:59] <TopHatHacker> ohhh wait
[16:39:29] <Chillance> care to explain this then: $(updateId, $data)
[16:39:53] <TopHatHacker> did you read the api?
[16:40:03] <TopHatHacker> $data is part of the selector on updateid
[16:40:17] <TopHatHacker> $(oldtag).replaceWith($(newtag))
[16:40:58] <TopHatHacker> $(updateId, $data) is a selector, and should be handled as such.. replace with just swaps those two elements
[16:42:03] <Chillance> aha, so  $(updateId, $data) will select whatever that id matches updateId in $data?
[16:42:18] <TopHatHacker> yup
[16:42:26] <TopHatHacker> that's just a different way of using a selector
[16:42:39] <TopHatHacker> savy?
[16:42:39] <Chillance> so, basically I need to have an element with that id in $data?
[16:42:48] <TopHatHacker> or, change the selector
[16:42:58] <TopHatHacker> you can do $('#id')
[16:43:02] <Chillance> sure
[16:43:03] <TopHatHacker> and that'll work just peachy
[16:43:14] <Chillance> but this is yii javascript code I prefer not to change :)
[16:43:32] <TopHatHacker> ... if it's broke you kinda have to change it
[16:43:37] <TopHatHacker> if it ain't broke, don't fix it
[16:43:58] <Chillance> well, I dont think its broken then, I just need to add more redundant data :)
[16:44:22] <TopHatHacker> .. you're redundant data
[16:44:39] <Chillance> basically what its doing is stripping away all other stuff
[16:45:13] <TopHatHacker> you should travers with selectors, it'll be faster later
[16:45:13] <Chillance> I'm redundant data? sure, if you say so
[16:45:24] <TopHatHacker> like using .find and .closest
[16:45:52] <Chillance> huh?
[16:46:58] <TopHatHacker> in a script always work with what you got, going up and down in elements from that starting point, so you dont' have to research an entire document to find a selector. ... look up "traversing the dom with jquery" sometime when you have an extra minute
[16:47:34] <TopHatHacker> not something you need to know now probably, but something to help you later onn when your apps are slowing down
[16:47:59] <Chillance> TopHatHacker, alright
[16:55:33] <Selenaa> .

[16:58:12] <chipnt> ups
[16:58:12] <chipnt> I did that?
[17:05:27] <lethjakman_lapto> hey, I've got some code I'm trying to execute for jstree inside of a $(document).ready, but it doesn't seem to execute. any idea why this would be happening?
[17:05:28] <lethjakman_lapto> https://gist.github.com/lethjakman/5234153
[17:05:31] <lethjakman_lapto> it works if I put it on a console
[17:05:46] <RandalSchwartz> jsfiddle?
[17:09:48] <lethjakman_lapto> RandalSchwartz: I was trying to figure out how to do an external JS library with that. is there a way without just dumping it all into my JS page?
[17:09:59] <TopHatHacker> mmm chilly
[17:10:01] <lethjakman_lapto> I need jstree
[17:10:11] <RandalSchwartz> just add a script tag
[17:11:41] <lethjakman_lapto> RandalSchwartz: in the html?
[17:12:42] <RandalSchwartz> yeah
[17:12:49] <lethjakman_lapto> ok, one moment.
[17:13:18] <RandalSchwartz> Oh... external resourcs
[17:13:25] <RandalSchwartz> you can add javascript/css there
[17:14:16] <TopHatHacker> if you add a script tag to the dom, will it load the src script?
[17:14:46] <johnkpaul> TopHatHacker: yes
[17:14:49] <johnkpaul> but you probably want getScript
[17:14:51] <johnkpaul> ?getScript @TopHatHacker
[17:14:53] <bot-t> TopHatHacker, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[17:15:19] <TopHatHacker> ya probably
[17:15:35] <TopHatHacker> i usually setup my sites better than that.. not needing getscript, just curious
[17:17:08] <aMoniker> Is that reliable?
[17:18:34] <johnkpaul> aMoniker: getScript?
[17:18:47] <aMoniker> johnkpaul: yes
[17:18:54] <johnkpaul> what does 'reliable' mean? it is as reliable as your http server
[17:19:00] <lethjakman_lapto> http://jsfiddle.net/RS5nR/1/
[17:19:10] <lethjakman_lapto> not sure how they did it, but I cheated. forked someone elses that worked.
[17:19:10] <aMoniker> johnkpaul: As in, cross-browser, good practice, etc.
[17:19:35] <lethjakman_lapto> I want the root node to be selected but it's not. it works if I run that code in a console.
[17:19:49] <johnkpaul> aMoniker: it works in all of the browsers jQuery supports
[17:19:51] <TopHatHacker> you really should be managing what js your document needs at the server level.. but getscript works in a pinch i bet
[17:19:55] <johnkpaul> good practice is a very it-depends kind of thing
[17:20:03] <johnkpaul> but as a tool, it is very useful
[17:20:13] <aMoniker> johnkpaul: I can see the use for it, just wondering if it's stable since I haven't used it.
[17:20:16] <johnkpaul> potentially, the tool could be used poorly
[17:20:21] <johnkpaul> aMoniker: everything in the jQuery docs is stable
[17:20:26] <johnkpaul> and tested across all of the browsers jQuery supports
[17:20:35] <johnkpaul> if it's in the API, it's been tested
[17:20:47] <johnkpaul> you can read their test suite if you'd like
[17:20:58] <aMoniker> johnkpaul: Sounds like a waste of time.
[17:21:20] <guy> is there a jquery selector to select :input with empty value? or must I use custom filter
[17:21:31] <johnkpaul> aMoniker: why?
[17:21:38] <johnkpaul> I'm curious yself, looking it up now
[17:21:53] <TopHatHacker> guy
[17:21:57] <TopHatHacker> use the [] attribute selector
[17:21:59] <aMoniker> johnkpaul: I'll let you handle it then, report back on any good info.
[17:22:04] <johnkpaul> aMoniker: lol
[17:22:07] <guy> TopHatHacker: what about checkbox?
[17:22:15] <johnkpaul> ther'es not really any info to get
[17:22:18] <TopHatHacker> so $('input[text=
[17:22:21] <aMoniker> johnkpaul: My point exactly.
[17:22:24] <johnkpaul> guy: I  think you'll have to write a custom selector
[17:22:26] <TopHatHacker> so $('input[text=""]')
[17:22:33] <guy> johnkpaul: gotcha
[17:22:46] <johnkpaul> aMoniker: I mean, you asked if it was cross browser, figured you'd want to know how they know that
[17:23:01] <TopHatHacker> guy: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[17:23:13] <johnkpaul> aMoniker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/unit/ajax.js#L1664
[17:23:53] <aMoniker> johnkpaul: What was Seneca's favorite wine?
[17:26:45] <omani_> how can I use
[17:26:54] <omani_> hold on
[17:27:20] <lethjakman_lapto> is there maybe a way to make sure one thing executes after another?
[17:27:35] <lethjakman_lapto> I think that's my problem but I'm not entirely sure
[17:27:38] <guy> Does this seem right? (To find all inputs without value)
[17:27:38] <guy> $(this).find('.ay-required :input:enabled:visible').filter(function () { return $(this).is(':checkbox') && !$(this).prop('checked') || !$(this).val(); })
[17:27:55] <aMoniker> lethjakman_lapto: If you're talking about async calls, you could use promises
[17:27:55] <omani_> how can I use this http://paste.scsys.co.uk/236805?ln=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it!
[17:28:12] <TopHatHacker> whoa that seems like alot of unneded stuff guy
[17:28:16] <omani_> to make it load the first 2 seconds and THEN wait 30 sekunden until next load
[17:28:17] <omani_> ?
[17:28:32] <RandalSchwartz> use what?
[17:28:46] <lethjakman_lapto> aMoniker: it's not an async, it's the code I posted in my fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/RS5nR/2/) it doesn't seem to select the top element unless I run it in my browser.
[17:28:52] <guy> TopHatHacker: wut?
[17:29:34] <TopHatHacker> $(this).find('input:not(:checked)') should get all checkboxes not checked
[17:29:50] <Ebonwumon> I have a form that "onsumbit='return validate()' " how can I get the form to pass data about itself to the validate? Eg, so I can see what specific form (there are multiple) that event fired from, so I can get the values from that form, and not the other ones.
[17:30:02] <guy> TopHatHacker: I need it for all sort of inputs
[17:30:06] <omani_> RandalSchwartz: the nopaste
[17:30:09] <omani_> I'm using already
[17:30:22] <omani_> but I need it to to at page load 2 sekunds. after that every 30 seconds
[17:31:07] <TopHatHacker> then put a comman in there i guess.. that filter seems unneeded but it should work
[17:31:11] <TopHatHacker> comma*
[17:32:50] <lenswipee> my jsfiddle gets stuck on "initialising the awesome". anyone else having this issue?
[17:34:03] <lenswipee> ah, when i switch to IE7 mode, jsfiddle gets stuck!
[17:34:15] <eddiemonge> lenswipee: nope. are you getting any console errors?
[17:34:20] <omani_> can somebody explain me why that code in my nopaste is getting executed although it's assigned to a variable?
[17:34:20] <TopHatHacker> $(this).find('input:not(:checked),input[value=""]')
[17:34:23] <TopHatHacker> try that one guy
[17:34:48] <eddiemonge> Ebonwumon: yuou shouldnt be using inline code.
[17:34:53] <portishead> is anyone here knows why I am getting Property '$' of object [object Object] is not a function from initiallizing zurb foundation?
[17:34:54] <portishead> does*
[17:35:06] <lenswipee> eddiemonge: no, jsfiddle just doesn't like IE7.
[17:35:09] <guy> TopHatHacker: that ignores many conditions..
[17:35:15] <TopHatHacker> like what?
[17:35:21] <Auger> hitting the tab button takes focus off an absolute positioned div and i can't get it back with document.getElementById('MyControl').focus(); - any suggestions
[17:35:22] <Ebonwumon> eddiemonge, I'm game, what's the proper practice I'm supposed to be doing here?
[17:35:45] <TopHatHacker> you want all input boxes? all check boxes taht are emppty? all textboxes that are empty? what do you want to find exactly
[17:35:52] <guy> TopHatHacker: :visible, :enabled
[17:36:08] <TopHatHacker> ... then add them?
[17:36:26] <TopHatHacker> $(this).find('input:not(:checked):visable:enabled,input[value=""]:visable:enabled')
[17:36:27] <guy> $(this).find(':input:visible:enable').filter('input:not(:checked),input[value=""]')
[17:36:41] <guy> well, uh.
[17:37:06] <guy> jQuery makes things too eary.
[17:37:08] <guy> easy*
[17:37:27] <guy> kinda boring. lacks the challenge part.
[17:37:33] <eddiemonge> lenswipee: and it shouldnt. nothing should
[17:37:33] <eddiemonge> Ebonwumon: put your js in an external file and bind it there
[17:37:54] <TopHatHacker> ha
[17:38:09] <eddiemonge> that is some ugly looking selectors
[17:38:18] <TopHatHacker> haha no, it's not pretty
[17:38:24] <Ebonwumon> OK eddiemonge, but now when I have $('.item').submit(handler()), it triggers on page load but not when I click the submits on the form, which is not expected behaviour.
[17:38:45] <TopHatHacker> edonwumon don't put the () in there
[17:38:52] <TopHatHacker> it will execute right away, you don't want that
[17:39:04] <guy> This will do. .find(':input:visible:enabled').filter(':checkbox:not(:checked), input[value=""]')
[17:39:24] <TopHatHacker> cool guy, doing some forms validation?
[17:39:27] <lenswipee> anyone know how to get jsfiddle to work in IE7?
[17:39:34] <eddiemonge> guy: the challenge is writing clean, efficient code using it
[17:39:38] <TopHatHacker> lenswipee, not use ie7
[17:39:48] <guy> eddiemonge: ha. efficient maybe.
[17:39:52] <TopHatHacker> sorry.... not use ie at all
[17:39:53] <Ebonwumon> oooooh. THanks TopHatHacker, that fixed it
[17:40:25] <TopHatHacker> ebonwumon not to be confused with function(){} .. that doesn't get called right away, that actually creates a variable
[17:41:11] <TopHatHacker> i suppose that's as close as javascript gets to by ref or by val? :P
[17:41:14] <Ebonwumon> Yeah TopHatHacker, I understand anonymous functions. That doesn't mean I remember how to use them properly all the time =P
[17:41:45] <TopHatHacker> inline functions are messy unless they can be on one line
[17:50:28] <eddiemonge> inline functions are messy
[17:50:28] <eddiemonge> nothing else needed :)
[17:51:23] <Ebonwumon> If I have two submit buttons in a form, how can I tell which one is the one that was used to submit the form?
[17:52:26] <TopHatHacker> ebonwumon different id's?
[17:52:35] <Andrew_R> Ebonwumon: you can give them each a different name attribute, the one that was used will have a value, other will not.
[17:52:37] <TopHatHacker> is the html of each tag identical?
[17:53:08] <Ebonwumon> Andrew_R, but submit buttons by definition have a value and that value is their text.
[17:53:50] <TopHatHacker> ebonqumon, what's the html of each tag? theres a ton of ways to tell them apart
[17:54:11] <Andrew_R> unless I am remembering something wrong, the browser will only send the value through for the submit button you click
[17:54:22] <TopHatHacker> ohh server side?
[17:56:47] <Andrew_R> yes it's correct, in the POST data or query string parameters, the browser only includes the submit button that was clicked/pressed
[17:59:24] <eddiemonge> Ebonwumon: this
[18:00:58] <Andrew_R> Ebonwumon: are you talking client side or server side?
[18:02:04] <portishead> can anyone help me with zurb-foundation?
[18:02:40] <portishead> I have setup it in the body like that http://pastie.org/7105303 and the UI is not responsive
[18:02:51] <Wolfed-> hum... I am expericing a sort of speed race I belive, not sure how to address it
[18:03:32] <Wolfed-> Oh wait
[18:03:37] <Wolfed-> Lemme see if this makes some sense...
[18:03:54] <portishead> set it up in the body*
[18:05:39] <Ebonwumon> Andrew_R, TopHatHacker client side, this is what it looks like http://pastie.org/7105343
[18:06:05] <Ebonwumon> I basically want to make a different ajax request depending on which of the two buttons was clicked, so I have to figure out which one was used to submit the form.
[18:08:29] <sdwrage> Hey all
[18:08:33] <lenswipee> Yo! how to pass php data from server-side to client-side using jQuery>?
[18:09:01] <sdwrage> Does anyone know a good HTML carousel? I have 9 cards I want to have in the carousel but 3 to display each. I don't want it to move forward automatically but allow the user to click arrows
[18:09:04] <sdwrage> :)
[18:09:39] <sdwrage> lenswipee, via an echo in whatever script tag would be sufficient I would assume
[18:10:20] <sdwrage> var name = <?php echo $name_here; ?>;
[18:10:41] <lenswipee> in the script?
[18:10:50] <lenswipee> in <script> of html
[18:10:52] <lenswipee> ?
[18:11:09] <sdwrage> in the <script> of html
[18:11:11] <sdwrage> not the css
[18:11:13] <sdwrage> unless you want to header the file as a js file
[18:11:19] <sdwrage> and have it as .php
[18:11:49] <lenswipee> sdwrage: how does it know what script to pass to?
[18:11:50] <tw2113> yeah
[18:11:50] <tw2113> <script> var myphpvalue = <?php echo 'this will be in myphpvalue'; ?>;
[18:11:50] <tw2113> and so on
[18:12:05] <tw2113> it doesn't, it just echos to the browser
[18:12:06] <lenswipee> tw2113: hi man
[18:12:31] <lenswipee> tw2113: how to grab that data using jquery?
[18:12:46] <sdwrage> tw2113, it returns html still
[18:12:49] <tw2113> i suppose you could do some sort of ajax get
[18:13:04] <Wolfed-> Ok I think I am facing a race issue here. I have this http://jsfiddle.net/XqP5V/
[18:13:09] <sdwrage> tw2113, it just replaces the php there through the interpreter and returns html text :P
[18:13:12] <Wolfed-> Any suggestions on how to avoid this race?
[18:13:22] <Andrew_R> Ebonwumon: sounds like they don't need to be submit's at all, change them to button's and bind events directly to those
[18:13:39] <tw2113> depends on what you're echoing
[18:13:40] <lenswipee> tw2113: you have done it before?
[18:14:05] <tw2113> i have no idea what the *details* are of what you're trying to do
[18:14:29] <portishead> can someone explain this for me: $links = $(this).find('a'); $active = $($links.filter('[href="'+location.hash+'"]')[0] || $links[0]); ?
[18:14:40] <sdwrage> Header("content-type: application/x-javascript");
[18:15:21] <tw2113> portishead, it looks like it grabs an object of all of the links
[18:15:36] <tw2113> and then filters down to just the one that holds the current location from location.hash
[18:15:47] <sdwrage> if you place that in a php file, it will treat the file as a javascript file. Then you can do <script type="text/javascript" src="script.php"> <script>
[18:15:48] <tw2113> OR if there's just one in the object, grabs that
[18:16:54] <sdwrage> so back to my question. Anyone know of a good html carousel? :P
[18:16:57] <portishead> thanks
[18:17:37] <lenswipee> sdwrage: so then i echo the php data in <script>. Now, how do i grab that data in my jquery script, say grab.js
[18:18:18] <tw2113> seriously lenswipee what are you trying to do
[18:18:22] <tw2113> and not "pass php data to js"
[18:18:27] <lenswipee> tw2113, sdwrage: idea is that a user clicks on a link, and depending on what link is clicked specific php data is passed to a jquery script?
[18:18:30] <sdwrage> so say you did <script> var data = <?php echo $datavar; ?>; </script>
[18:18:45] <sdwrage> then you could include your script that uses $data
[18:19:00] <sdwrage> or, you could use a php file with a js header
[18:19:01] <sdwrage> Header("content-type: application/x-javascript");
[18:19:21] <sdwrage> when you include the php file, it will act as though it is a js file.
[18:19:31] <Andrew_R> Wolfed-: yes, your animation isn't finishing before the ajax complete gets called.
[18:19:32] <tw2113> honestly sounds like you'll want some ajax post in there
[18:19:36] <Wolfed-> Anyone? Its not a race condition between ajax requests but more like a race condition between my code
[18:19:42] <Wolfed-> Oh
[18:19:44] <Andrew_R> I updated your fiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/XqP5V/1/
[18:20:12] <sdwrage> tw2113, I agree unless it is something ridiculously simple
[18:20:18] <sdwrage> such as printing an IP address or something
[18:20:20] <Andrew_R> so in the complete, it calls .stop() to stop any animation in progress, then does a .fadeOut(0) to immediately fade it out, then run as you had it
[18:20:31] <lenswipee> sdwrage: what do you mean " then you could include your script that uses $data"
[18:20:33] <Wolfed-> Ahh I see
[18:20:54] <Wolfed-> I never expected my ajax requests to be faster than anything else
[18:20:55] <Wolfed-> lol
[18:21:02] <Wolfed-> Thanks a lot Andrew_R
[18:21:11] <Andrew_R> your 1 second of fadeOut and fadeIn to show "Loading..." might be too long, depending on how long you expect the ajax call to take
[18:21:30] <lenswipee> sdwrage: i have one php script that echos data in <script>, and another js that i hope to grab that data.
[18:21:54] <sdwrage> remember that if you have code inside script that any script included acts as though it is in the html itself as well. That means that <script> $var = "stuff"; </script> can be accessed by the included js file
[18:22:17] <Wolfed-> Yeah well while testing this in localhost, it used to take between 2-5 seconds
[18:22:23] <Wolfed-> So I never went through this issue before
[18:22:35] <Wolfed-> Guess that states servers > home computers
[18:22:36] <Wolfed-> :P
[18:23:06] <Andrew_R> depends on your home computer lol
[18:23:09] <tw2113> lenswipee, remember that by the time js is running at all, all of the php has already been processed and done
[18:23:15] <lenswipee> sdwrage: so everthing is done in ONE file?
[18:23:27] <Wolfed-> Touche :P
[18:23:41] <tw2113> so you're either going to need to store the php stuff into js variables and act conditionally with those, or post back to the server and get new data
[18:23:53] <Andrew_R> related question to what lenswipee is doing... anyone ever use a .cshtml razor view files to server javascript code?
[18:24:06] <tw2113> never heard of it Andrew_R
[18:24:28] <Andrew_R> it's part of asp.net MVC
[18:24:35] <Andrew_R> probably a better question for ##csharp
[18:24:40] <tw2113> that'd be why i had never heard of it
[18:25:28] <Andrew_R> I'm thinking about doing something similar to the thing you guys are talking about with php, only with asp.net
[18:25:39] <beachandbytes> Andrew_R did you mean to serve js?
[18:25:46] <Andrew_R> yes
[18:25:53] <lenswipee> test.php: $var = "foo"; <script><?php echo $var; ?></script> //this what you mean?
[18:26:10] <beachandbytes> im not sure if its exactly what you mean but often ill
[18:26:19] <Andrew_R> we have our JS files separated out from the views, but are finding there are some info we need from the models in the JS
[18:26:30] <beachandbytes> <script> var something = @Html.Raw(SomethingJson); </script>
[18:26:31] <portishead> wtf
[18:26:32] <beachandbytes> in razor files
[18:27:14] <tw2113> lenswipee, i was talking about every possible bit of data you want to act on based on what the user clicks, into js variables, and then do if statements and swap in the right variable based on that
[18:27:39] <wroathe> fg
[18:27:47] <tw2113> or at least an array of the possible options
[18:28:02] <Andrew_R> beachandbytes: that's pretty much what I'm doing right now, but now I have a partial view that is going to be included from several other views and the JS could have a common model
[18:29:30] <beachandbytes> what problems do you foresee with that
[18:30:09] <Andrew_R> I don't like that I'll have to add the same lines to the bottom of every View that uses this partial
[18:30:12] <lenswipee> test.php: $var = "foo"; <script> var $foo = <?php echo $var; ?></script> //this what you mean?
[18:30:45] <tw2113> var myarray = [option1, option2, option3];
[18:30:52] <tw2113> likely forgot quotes, sue me
[18:31:02] <lenswipee> next
[18:31:33] <sdwrage> lenswipee, just try this simple test. <script> $var = <?php echo "bar"; ?>; </script>
[18:31:33] <sdwrage> and then include a file that prints out $var to the console
[18:31:39] <tw2113> if ( clicked this one ) { use myarray[0]; } elseif ( clicked that one ){ use myarray[1]; } else { use myarray[2] }
[18:31:48] <Andrew_R> I wouldn't want to pass all the JS files through Razor, so then it becomes an organization issue.
[18:31:52] <tw2113> not syntax correct
[18:32:06] <beachandbytes> I wouldn't do that still good seperation of concerns to keep most data in seperate js files
[18:32:07] <sdwrage_clone> -_-
[18:32:07] <sdwrage_clone> I swear my wifi is going to kill me eventually
[18:32:08] <Andrew_R> Some we do this way, others we do normal... This is a project with 5 other developers.
[18:32:40] <tw2113> i still have no idea what lenswipee is trying to do other than use some php value on context to what was clicked
[18:34:02] <Andrew_R> I think what's I'm going to end up doing is instead of assigning separate js variables, create a model for it and json serialize it, so I will have one line at the bottom of the View like var jsModel = @(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(Model.JSModel));
[18:34:23] <Andrew_R> then I can access jsModel.PropName in my js file
[18:35:01] <lenswipee> test.php: $myArray = array('foo','bar','baz'); <script> var $object = <?php json_encode($var); ?>; If(this) do that; else do this</script> //this what you mean?
[18:35:21] <tw2113> the more you type, the less sense you make
[18:35:23] <tw2113> sorry
[18:35:35] <lenswipee> test.php: $myArray = array('foo','bar','baz'); <script> var $object = <?php echo json_encode($var); ?>; If(this) do that; else do this</script> //this what you mean?
[18:35:52] <tw2113> EXPLAIN IN DETAIL WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO
[18:36:01] <lenswipee> tw2113, sdwrage: idea is that a user clicks on a link, and depending on what link is clicked specific php data is passed to a jquery script?
[18:36:02] <tw2113> you're too f'n vague still
[18:36:14] <tw2113> what the fuck does that mean
[18:36:23] <tw2113> what type of data
[18:36:33] <tw2113> what are the links related to
[18:36:34] <lenswipee> array
[18:36:41] <lenswipee> products
[18:36:41] <tw2113> array of what
[18:36:55] <sdwrage> what was the last thing I posted?
[18:36:57] <lenswipee> array of product info
[18:37:20] <tw2113> so you want to pull product data depending on the product link they click?
[18:37:28] <lenswipee> yes
[18:37:58] <sdwrage> lenswipee, why does this almost feel it needs to be an ajax call to a php script to fetch product info from a db?
[18:38:08] <tw2113> sounds like the perfect chance for some ajaxifying
[18:38:22] <sdwrage> tw2113, agreed
[18:38:38] <lenswipee> i want to do it via <script></script>
[18:38:40] <tw2113> you can use some data attributes to store the product id
[18:38:45] <tw2113> and pass that in with the ajax call
[18:39:00] <tw2113> that is what ajax would entail
[18:39:04] <lenswipee> tw2113: that's too easy
[18:39:17] <lenswipee> tw2113: i want to do it <script></script>
[18:39:22] <tw2113> so you should be able to do it, if it's so easy
[18:39:30] <tw2113> yes, js will watch WHAT YOU CLICK
[18:39:36] <tw2113> and post it to the server via ajax
[18:39:42] <tw2113> and on the server, some php script will do its thing
[18:39:43] <lenswipee> tw2113: i want to do it <script></script> <-- this way is hard
[18:39:47] <tw2113> and return the resulting product info
[18:39:54] <tw2113> and back in the script, you change the html markup
[18:40:00] <lenswipee> tw2113: ajax is easy
[18:40:02] <tw2113> *deskhead*
[18:40:10] <tw2113> *repeatedly*
[18:40:20] <lenswipee> haha
[18:42:05] <Wolfed-> So fadeIn/fadeOut "store" the opacity at which the selector was when it starts, right?
[18:46:43] <Andrew_R> Wolfed-: yes I think that's true
[18:47:36] <Wolfed-> hmph
[18:48:42] <Wolfed-> Ok there I managed to make it show properly :D
[18:50:43] <sdwrage> wait …
[18:50:59] <sdwrage> lenswipee, why the hell do you want to do it the hard way?
[18:51:00] <sdwrage> 0_o
[18:51:31] <lenswipee> sdwrage: i want to learn more than one way of doing it
[18:52:14] <lenswipee> test.php: $myArray = array('foo','bar','baz'); <script> var $object = <?php echo json_encode($var); ?>; If($condition) do something; else do this something;</script> //this what you mean?
[18:52:30] <lenswipee> that's my latest development
[18:54:15] <shoky> looks too easy to me
[18:56:13] <lenswipee> but it doesn't work, why?
[18:57:22] <sdwrage> lenswipee, what is $var in this context?
[18:57:32] <sdwrage> and this really isn't the place to discuss this really :)
[18:57:43] <sdwrage> this is a JQuery channel
[18:57:58] <sdwrage> this is more a raw JS issue tbh
[18:58:02] <lenswipee> oops $var should have been $myArray
[18:59:08] <lenswipee> test.php: $myArray = array('foo','bar','baz'); <script> var $object = <?php echo json_encode($myArray); ?>; If($condition){}; else{};</script> //so now its like this. comments?
[18:59:45] <lenswipee> pff
[19:01:07] <Andrew_R> lenswipee: look at your View Source window in the browser. Do you get the results you expected?
[19:01:49] <lenswipee> Andrew_R: Hi man! I get nothing. Does the code look right to you?
[19:02:23] <Andrew_R> what you showed looks ok. no output at all, maybe you have php syntax errors?
[19:02:58] <Andrew_R> If($condition){}; else{}; -- you don't really have semi-colons there do you?
[19:05:10] <lenswipee> ah
[19:05:17] <lenswipee> that could be it man
[19:05:54] <lenswipee> Andrew_R: nope, that wasn't it. you got another way of doing it?
[19:06:21] <Andrew_R> sdwrage is right, this isn't really jQuery related, but if you want to paste you full php file somewhere I'll take a look at it
[19:06:24] <Andrew_R> you can pm me if you want
[19:16:28] <defaultro> any recommended beautifier plugin for firefox?
[19:19:12] <prefixed> err
[19:20:02] <prefixed> why isn't firefox pulling the "background" css information out of a div that has valid background markup? (this does work in chrome and IE7+)
[19:30:45] <alwayslearning> hey anyone know if i can make a button BOTH close the current window AND open a new window? Something similar to this example + closing the current window: http://bytes.com/topic/html-css/answers/941131-open-new-tab-button-click
[19:34:20] <prefixed> why isn't firefox pulling the "background" css information out of a div that has valid background markup? (this does work in chrome and IE7+)
[19:43:23] <alwayslearning> Hey guys how can i make a button inside an iframe open a link inside the current browser window and not inside the iframe???
[19:44:23] <systemfault> target="_top" perhaps
[19:53:22] <Guddu> Dear friends...I have a Form that has a File Upload Input Field. I am passnig the form data using Ajax POST to the server. Before passing the data I use serialize call. . . however, it looks like that the serialize call is stripping the file information. What could be wrong?
[19:53:35] <Guddu> var data = $('#form_id').serialize();
[19:54:33] <systemfault> You cannot send files with ajax unless you use XHR2+FormData directly
[19:55:40] <Guddu> systemfault, Thanks for your response. What did you mean by Directly?
[19:56:21] <eddiemonge> Guddu: google html5 file upload
[19:57:00] <Guddu> Thanks eddiemonge
[19:57:07] <relipse> does anyone know how to do automatic testing on html pages?
[19:57:22] <Guddu> I will have to run this web app on IE 8 . . . Not sure if HTML5 fares welll
[19:57:55] <systemfault> Guddu: Without using jQuery
[19:58:07] <Guddu> Thanks systemfault I will explore that option
[19:58:17] <systemfault> Guddu: Then you'll need to use hacksâ€¦. flash uploaders, file uploaders using hidden iframes...
[19:59:59] <eddiemonge> Guddu: you'll need a non-ajax fallback then
[19:59:59] <eddiemonge> relipse: what do you mean?
[20:08:39] <dawncold1> hi
[20:09:20] <dawncold1> guys,I got an error called "No Transport" in IE6, anyone had ever come across it?
[20:11:16] <relipse>  i just set up virtual host on my win7 machine from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3947796/virtualhost-on-xampp but now i'm getting: Access forbidden! anyone have any idea?
[20:16:12] <Andrew_R> relipse: not a jquery question, but I believe that might have something to do with file permissions
[20:16:48] <Andrew_R> I haven't used XAMPP for years, so I can't remember if apache is run as your user or a different account.
[20:28:13] <eddiemonge> relipse: did you try following these instructions http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html#522
[20:44:31] <someprimetime> sup boys
[20:44:42] <someprimetime> eddie just left
[20:44:43] <someprimetime> dang
[21:22:06] <Andrew_R> here's a weird one: $.parseJSON("{carrierid:'1',carriername:'CarrierName'}") -- SyntaxError: JSON.parse: expected property name or '}'
[21:22:40] <Andrew_R> var test = {carrierid:'1',carriername:'CarrierName'};   works fine
[21:22:45] <coldhead> that's not valid JSON
[21:22:50] <coldhead> you MUST quote your keys in json
[21:22:57] <coldhead> ?jsonlint
[21:23:08] <coldhead> http://jsonlint.com/
[21:23:12] <coldhead> thanks for nothing, bot-t
[21:23:49] <Andrew_R> oh yeah... I should probably take a break
[21:24:00] <Andrew_R> tnx
[21:24:21] <coldhead> let's all take a break!
[21:35:26] <nomad111> hello, I have a page in which i embed a fullscreen <video> element on document ready. on that same page is a link with a higher z-index (so it's overlayed on top) with 'click touchstart' handler bound (using on()). for some reason on chrome desktop the handler is executed when i click the link as expected but on an iPhone running iOS 6 nothing is fired. however, if i remove the code responsible for inserting the video then the event is
[21:35:26] <nomad111> fired. any ideas on why this is happening?
[21:40:45] <djshotglass> trying to grab the value of the selected option in a <select>
[21:40:58] <djshotglass> $("#selectAmount option:selected").val();
[21:41:00] <djshotglass> does not work
[21:42:38] <coldhead> i think you can be lazier
[21:42:44] <coldhead> $('#selectAmount').val()
[21:43:53] <djshotglass> tried that
[21:44:07] <djshotglass> just realized im an idiot and didnt save the body this the select had no id
[21:44:17] <coldhead> -_-
[21:44:41] <djshotglass> lol thanks
[21:44:59] <coldhead> better luck next time!
[21:52:03] <EddieK> djshotglass: :D lol made my morning
[22:02:32] <vladikoff> NahimN, sup
[22:02:41] <NahimN> yo
[22:26:24] <b1lly> coldhead: !
[22:31:16] <coldhead> hi b1lly
[22:31:20] <coldhead> happy new week
[22:31:31] <b1lly> yeah right
[22:31:37] <b1lly> coldhead: I made some additions to trubbles.com
[22:31:44] <coldhead> ooh lemme see
[22:32:37] <alwayslearning> can anyone help me figure out this script i'm trying to make. I want a script thats included on a page to check if its being loaded from within an iframe, if it is then it should hide certain css elements http://jsfiddle.net/Bxhkb/1/
[22:33:21] <EddieK> just check window.parent?
[22:33:36] <EddieK> if(window.parent !== void(0)){ alert('iframe'); }
[22:33:41] <coldhead> very cute b1lly
[22:33:45] <coldhead> i hope this gets you laid a lot
[22:33:47] <b1lly> its a bit laggy hah
[22:34:13] <coldhead> pfft
[22:34:31] <alwayslearning> EddieK how would i tie that into the hiding css portion
[22:34:53] <EddieK> sry?
[22:34:53] <alwayslearning> if self !== top should do the trick shouldnt it?
[22:35:28] <EddieK> well yeah, but u can use it clock wise as well, its just the way you choose
[22:35:46] <systemfault> You add a class to the body element if the page is iframed.
[22:36:01] <systemfault> Then you can use CSS with that class to adjust the styling.
[22:36:36] <EddieK> another way just to be sure is to use opener
[22:36:49] <EddieK> if(window.opener){ .. this is iframe .. }
[22:37:28] <eddiemonge> alwayslearning: whats it for? why do you want to know if its in an iframe or not?
[22:39:11] <alwayslearning> would something like this work? http://jsfiddle.net/Bxhkb/2/
[22:39:52] <alwayslearning> eddiemonge, i couldn't ouput the correct woocommerce product view i wanted into my template so i'm stuck with iframing it in from its own page
[22:40:58] <eddiemonge> alwayslearning: why couldnt you output it? seems like the wrong solution for the wrong problem
[22:41:57] <alwayslearning> i can't figure out where to find it, its outputting from a combination of two plugins
[22:42:17] <alwayslearning> Add something to cart so you can see my dilemma: http://butterlane.com/butterlanedev/store/
[22:43:28] <djQuery> who ho got my badge http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/
[22:43:37] <djQuery> woopty do
[22:43:45] <eddiemonge> alwayslearning: perhaps im confused why you are using an iframe to begin with
[22:44:23] <djQuery> eddiemonge, because iframes are COOL
[22:44:45] <eddiemonge> as cool as the blink or marqee tag?
[22:44:58] <djQuery> well.... maybe not
[22:45:13] <EddieK> djQuery: disagree
[22:45:38] <EddieK> iframes are not cool, XHR is cool
[22:45:41] <djQuery> http://www.htmlmarquee.com/title.html
[22:45:56] <djQuery> gotta admin that blink is pretty bling
[22:45:57] <EddieK> I hate my self now... why did I opened that
[22:46:33] <coldhead> wow way to be, freenode
[22:46:39] <coldhead> thinspirational
[22:46:59] <tw2113> hey, my website!
[22:51:05] <Andrew_R> the website I am rewriting had so many iframes there was a jquery custom plugin to search through all the iframes to find the selector you wanted
[22:51:12] <Andrew_R> it was recursive
[22:51:32] <tw2113> iframes make me rage
[22:52:21] <Andrew_R> the iframes go at least 3 levels deep - iframeception
[22:53:00] <tw2113> pretty sure the previous dev hated something or someone
[22:55:13] <djQuery> dilbert is great today
[22:55:38] <Andrew_R> more like incompetence I think
[22:56:19] <tw2113> so he hated himself
[22:57:49] <alwayslearning> lol speaking of iframeception
[22:58:17] <alwayslearning> if self !== window reminded of inception
[22:59:36] <Andrew_R> you have to have all those iframes so you can have them each post back every time anything happens
[22:59:45] <Andrew_R> he claimed it was Microsoft's model
[23:01:56] <Cork> there are quite a few web developers that seams to think that what they learned in the 90's is the way to do it, and there is no need to keep up with what happens
[23:02:14] <Cork> and ya, back in the 90's iframe was the ajax solution
[23:04:09] <alwayslearning> hmm why won't this detect itself as an iframe and modify the css http://jsfiddle.net/Bxhkb/3/
[23:04:13] <coldhead> basically if you use an iframe for any reason and try to make it #jQUery's problem, we will kill you
[23:04:21] <alwayslearning> i'll be leaving now
[23:05:34] <Cork> uh $(window).contents().find('#logo')
[23:06:01] <Cork> that looks like... the most pointless extra work i can think of
[23:09:12] <fomf> Does anyone know how I can solve this error? (check console) http://jsfiddle.net/XUyXT/1/
[23:10:35] <b1lly> yeah
[23:10:43] <b1lly> create jquery objects of the hash
[23:10:51] <b1lly> or return the nodes
[23:11:22] <Cork> fomf: http://jsfiddle.net/XUyXT/3/
[23:11:56] <coldhead> nice work Cork
[23:12:02] <coldhead> why don't you take five
[23:12:05] <fomf> Cork: glorious
[23:12:06] <fomf> thanks
[23:12:19] <Cork> fomf: you can't use a variable name as .<variable>
[23:12:28] <Cork> so you need to use []
[23:12:45] <fomf> Yeah I knew that just didn't think of it in this case fml
[23:14:49] <Mr_Grim> when i do: var tableRow = trows[0]; trows[0] = tableRow; trows.appendTo("table"); it screws up my table... why would the behavior occur this way?
[23:15:03] <fomf> http://jsfiddle.net/XUyXT/4/ in  terms of efficiency or proper-ness of doing this kind of stuff, how does this rank?
[23:15:09] <Mr_Grim> if I just do: trows.appendTo("table"); everything works
[23:15:14] <Mr_Grim> trying to learn something here
[23:15:27] <Cork> Mr_Grim: why would you move dom elements in an existing jquery object?
[23:15:43] <Mr_Grim> Cork I want to modify the table row that is cloned
[23:15:46] <Mr_Grim> i need to change values
[23:15:57] <Cork> you mean tableRow = trows[0] ?
[23:15:58] <Mr_Grim> id's, names, do some math
[23:15:58] <Mr_Grim> etc
[23:16:03] <Cork> that doens't clone the element
[23:16:10] <Cork> ?.clone @ Mr_Grim
[23:16:24] <Mr_Grim> i was using .clone earlier
[23:16:40] <Mr_Grim> var trows = $("#household_table_children tr:last").clone();
[23:16:54] <Cork> ok?
[23:16:58] <someprimetime> oh snape it's mr grim
[23:17:03] <Mr_Grim> oh nm
[23:17:07] <Mr_Grim> i think i figured out whats going on
[23:17:08] <Mr_Grim> one sec
[23:17:10] <coldhead> BRAVE MEN RUN IN MY FAMILY
[23:17:12] <Mr_Grim> going to try something
[23:17:18] <dawncold1> why I always got No Transport in IE6, and I just post some data to my site, not cross-site...
[23:17:24] <someprimetime> the imgur guy?
[23:18:07] <Cork> dawncold1: have you been able to reproduce it in a testcase yet?
[23:18:44] <dawncold1> Cork: oh Cork, remember me ?I asked this question
[23:18:50] <Cork> yup
[23:19:47] <dawncold1> Cork: I want to know how it wroks, and I still read the source code of jQuery1.8.3 I am using
[23:20:26] <Cork> dawncold1: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxTransport/ should help you out
[23:21:15] <dawncold1> Cork: I need add a own transport?
[23:21:24] <Cork> dawncold1: no
[23:21:47] <Cork> but your code is doing something wacky, and the fastest way to figure out what is trying to reproduce the problem
[23:22:40] <didiergm> jqm - pagebeforechange event is called twice once with parameter toPage as a DOM element, once with toPage being a JQ object. How can I tell whether toPage is a DOM elt or a jq object ?
[23:24:14] <dawncold1> Cork: so, which datatype I should use? my server just return a string back...I need a text type?
[23:24:33] <Cork> dawncold1: what matters is the Content-Type header
[23:24:59] <Cork> look in your development console what the server is sending back
[23:25:23] <eddiemonge> dawncold1: you could specify text or html
[23:25:43] <dawncold1> eddiemonge: my content-type is "text/html; charset=UTF-8"
[23:25:59] <Cork> eddiemonge: that doesn't always work
[23:26:13] <Cork> what the server sends take precedent in some cases
[23:26:22] <Cork> dawncold1: so its not that
[23:26:25] <Mr_Grim> how would i set the first td value in a tr (table row?
[23:26:29] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: met you @ techliminal back a few months ago in oakland
[23:26:30] <Mr_Grim> i almost have this figured out
[23:26:37] <someprimetime> have you done any talks since?
[23:26:41] <Cork> Mr_Grim: set the first?
[23:26:43] <dawncold1> Cork: yeah, the happy path is return a string back
[23:26:46] <Cork> Mr_Grim: or select the first?
[23:26:52] <Mr_Grim> set the first
[23:26:54] <Mr_Grim> i can select the first
[23:26:55] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: no. ive been busy so far this year but im trying to get some things together soon
[23:27:00] <Mr_Grim> i was trying...
[23:27:03] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: ah same
[23:27:07] <Cork> dawncold1: http only uses string basically,
[23:27:11] <Mr_Grim> $(tableRow).find("td:first").val(rowNumber)
[23:27:12] <someprimetime> minus getting things together
[23:27:25] <djQuery> Mr_Grim, $(tr).find('td').first()  or slower   $(tr).find('td:first')
[23:27:29] <eddiemonge> Cork: As of jQuery 1.5, jQuery can convert a dataType from what it received in the Content-Type header to what you require
[23:27:44] <Cork> Mr_Grim: $(tableRow).prepend(td)
[23:27:53] <someprimetime> Mr_Grim: you want text() instead of val()?
[23:27:57] <Mr_Grim> i think text
[23:27:58] <Mr_Grim> yeah
[23:28:00] <Mr_Grim> just looked that up
[23:28:06] <someprimetime> val is for form inputs
[23:28:18] <someprimetime> text is just innerhtml
[23:28:28] <someprimetime> but escaped iirc
[23:28:28] <Cork> eddiemonge: to my experience its ignored, at least in 1.6 haven't tested in newer ones
[23:28:38] <Mr_Grim> okay
[23:28:40] <Mr_Grim> that works
[23:28:42] <Mr_Grim> but my css is lost
[23:28:49] <eddiemonge> Cork: got a test case? dataType sets the preference
[23:28:50] <Mr_Grim> i had a circle being rendered around my number
[23:28:50] <someprimetime> maybe use html()?
[23:28:52] <Mr_Grim> and its gone now
[23:29:01] <someprimetime> Mr_Grim: got a fiddle?
[23:29:12] <Cork> eddiemonge: not a ready one no
[23:29:12] <Mr_Grim> hard to fiddle it
[23:29:18] <Mr_Grim> confidential work project unfortunatly
[23:29:49] <someprimetime> what are you trying to do copy a table row?
[23:29:54] <someprimetime> and maintain it's css?
[23:29:57] <Mr_Grim> yeah
[23:29:58] <Mr_Grim> i have to
[23:30:08] <Mr_Grim> when i change the value of the td, the css is lost
[23:30:41] <Cork> Mr_Grim: how are you changing the values of the td?
[23:30:56] <Mr_Grim> ahhh
[23:30:59] <Mr_Grim> cause the class is gone
[23:31:31] <someprimetime> addClass('class')
[23:31:35] <someprimetime> viola
[23:31:53] <someprimetime> anyone ever take caffeine pills?
[23:31:57] <someprimetime> think I may go get some to pull an all nighter
[23:32:51] <Mr_Grim> not working
[23:32:51] <tw2113> don't pull a spano
[23:32:52] <Mr_Grim> renders a box
[23:32:55] <Mr_Grim> not a circle
[23:32:55] <Mr_Grim> wtf
[23:32:58] <Mr_Grim> should be a circle
[23:33:03] <someprimetime> the hell is a spano
[23:33:21] <someprimetime> Mr_Grim: it's pretty hard to help you without a demo
[23:33:22] <tw2113> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bflYjF90t7c
[23:33:29] <tw2113> someprimetime, ^
[23:33:34] <Mr_Grim> ill bug you guys tomorrow
[23:33:35] <Mr_Grim> im going to bed
[23:33:37] <Mr_Grim> 2:30 am here
[23:33:42] <Mr_Grim> need to be at work for 9:00
[23:33:47] <someprimetime> hahahaha i totally remember this
[23:34:02] <someprimetime> man saved by the bell every morning before school
[23:34:32] <Mr_Grim> im working as a developer in management consulting
[23:34:34] <Mr_Grim> its STRICT
[23:34:47] <someprimetime> just be sure to 'use strict';
[23:34:52] <someprimetime> ba da doosh
[23:34:56] <Mr_Grim> har har har
[23:35:01] <Mr_Grim> i wear a suit and tie tomorrow
[23:35:14] <someprimetime> wear a diaper
[23:35:16] <someprimetime> way more professional
[23:35:20] <Mr_Grim> oh yeah
[23:35:20] <tw2113> i think it's a bit of a shame no one remembers this from the same episode someprimetime https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzHFSdPutjY
[23:35:21] <Mr_Grim> for sure
[23:35:32] <Mr_Grim> i work so hard, i dont even take time to use the mens room
[23:35:45] <Mr_Grim> my foul smell is the bi product of working so hard
[23:36:06] <Mr_Grim> actually it would take longer to change the diaper in the end so it very efficient
[23:36:11] <someprimetime> tw2113: yeah wtf?
[23:36:17] <someprimetime> i definitely do not remember that
[23:36:23] <someprimetime> not sure why though
[23:36:33] <tw2113> part of that "i have to sing" line
[23:36:37] <someprimetime> this the twerk team?
[23:37:27] <coldhead> no, not this
[23:38:20] <someprimetime> tw2113: you like kpop?
[23:38:36] <someprimetime> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7mPqycQ0tQ
[23:39:28] <tw2113> can't say yes
[23:39:45] <someprimetime> sure you can
[23:42:07] <relipse> what is another phrase for "Test Scripts"
[23:42:24] <someprimetime> huh?
[23:42:26] <someprimetime> in what context?
[23:42:29] <someprimetime> testing your own code?
[23:42:37] <someprimetime> unit testing?
[23:43:53] <relipse> human testing though, not automated
[23:44:16] <eddiemonge> like eye tracking?
[23:44:23] <someprimetime> quality assurance?
[23:44:29] <relipse> describing a script that a human can go through to test my webpage
[23:44:48] <someprimetime> what is "a robot?"
[23:45:50] <eddiemonge> relipse: you mean like manually visiting a qunit test? or like clicking around in your application?
[23:46:30] <coldhead> expressway to yr skull
[23:46:57] <someprimetime> something like selenium?
[23:47:03] <someprimetime> i give up
[23:47:14] <eddiemonge> i feel like this is a riddle with no answer
[23:47:25] <oksushi> coldhead: sonic youth fan?
[23:47:30] <relipse> eddie: clicking around
[23:47:47] <relipse> basically i dont want to use the word "script"
[23:48:11] <relipse> even though the human will follow directions to see if it produces expected result
[23:48:14] <eddiemonge> oh you mean human testing as in not click testing, one of the most inefficient testing methods but one i use quite often
[23:48:17] <someprimetime> is this mechnical turk?
[23:48:31] <Andrew_R> smoke test
[23:48:38] <someprimetime> smoke bomb
[23:48:46] <someprimetime> m80
[23:48:57] <someprimetime> backfire
[23:49:08] <Andrew_R> regression testing
[23:49:20] <someprimetime> someone is familiar with QA over here
[23:49:25] * someprimetime points @ Andrew_R 
[23:49:26] <relipse> what is another word for s
[23:49:28] <relipse> script
[23:49:34] <someprimetime> program
[23:49:44] <someprimetime> wordhippo.com
[23:50:01] <Andrew_R> those are the 2 terms our QA people use
[23:50:17] <relipse> regression?
[23:50:22] <relipse> what does regression mean?
[23:50:27] <relipse> !dict regression
[23:50:32] <someprimetime> relipse: for real?
[23:50:56] <Andrew_R> the smoke tests are shorter tests that test out a specific process over a few pages
[23:51:01] <relipse> yeah regression is not the word i'm looking for
[23:51:10] <relipse> i want to have a bunch of tests that people go through and look for expected result
[23:51:12] <relipse> what do i call those?
[23:51:18] <someprimetime> you call them tests
[23:51:21] <someprimetime> that's what you just called them
[23:51:32] <Andrew_R> regression testing is a full test of the entire app, making sure everything works as expected
[23:52:43] <eddiemonge> relipse: what is it you are doing? writing a paper or actually doing something?
[23:53:38] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: you got a sec to help me figure out some async callback soup madness with node?
[23:53:57] <eddiemonge> you just spoke latin to me
[23:54:04] <someprimetime> k nm
[23:54:09] <relipse> nevermind i just called them human test scripts
[23:54:18] <eddiemonge> latin learned by klingons in a romulan ship inside the death star
[23:54:25] <eddiemonge> but maybe
[23:55:45] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: what you got?
[23:56:18] <Cork> relipse: you might be looking for the term reftests
[23:56:31] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/AWdYQ/
[23:56:36] <someprimetime> that's my method to look up submissions
[23:56:42] <someprimetime> it needs to do a few things before it renders it though
[23:56:43] <Cork> if it is tests that a person is meant to verify the outcome of
[23:57:13] <someprimetime> 1) look up the submission by id, 2) grab the views associated with the submission if there are any, if not, then make an insertion with the user's ip 3) render the page
[23:57:32] <someprimetime> I'm going to be replacing 3) with fetching the votes when I tie that piece in, but for now that's what I'm trying to do
[23:58:03] <someprimetime> the problem is that when it goes into getViewCount's callback, (at the very bottom with the large comment), it'll go into the first branch if there are no views yet on the submission
[23:58:05] <someprimetime> and then call addView()
[23:58:16] <someprimetime> addView() takes too long, so the execution context just skips over it
[23:58:41] <someprimetime> and hangs here: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/AWdYQ/1/
[23:58:47] <someprimetime> look @ the new large comment @ the very bottom
