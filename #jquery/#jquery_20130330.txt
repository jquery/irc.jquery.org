[00:15:45] <djQuery> can anyone explain why the animationStarted event gets fired 55 times?
[00:15:48] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/ezatet/2/edit
[00:37:46] <ph88> djQuery:  some hours ago i asked "what's the best way to submit a slider ( http://jqueryui.com/slider )to a form (no ajax)  ?"  and you said "just create an input and call slider on it"
[00:38:00] <ph88> djQuery: i was wondering what type of input would be good for this, a hidden one ?
[00:38:19] <ph88> o/ alex88
[00:40:24] <smakatak> im trying to insert a new row after an existing row in my table using .after(). for some reason the new row gets inserted inside of the <tr> that im using to call .after().
[00:40:28] <smakatak> any ideas?
[00:43:51] <ph88> smakatak:  maybe you can use append("<tr><td</td><tr>")
[00:44:10] <smakatak> that would append to the end of the table i think
[00:44:14] <ph88> ya
[00:44:37] <smakatak> i do i find for a particular row and i need to insert after that particular row
[00:44:48] <MaxM> http://jsfiddle.net/ASgkL/
[00:44:50] <ph88> i dunno about that
[00:45:12] <MaxM> how can you delete imgs with no src using jquery
[00:45:36] <MaxM> like, look for all imgs with a src = '' and delete them
[00:45:42] <ph88> MaxM: did you figure out how to select those imgs ?
[00:45:54] <MaxM> no
[00:46:11] <ph88> i think it's ["src"=""]
[00:46:23] <MaxM> let me mess with that
[00:48:38] <ph88> MaxM:  maybe this $('img[src]=""').remove()
[00:48:54] <MaxM> I'll try
[00:49:22] <MaxM> something is wrong
[00:49:27] <MaxM> it looks right
[00:49:29] <ph88> MaxM: do you know how to submit a slider from jquery ui to a form ?
[00:49:49] <MaxM> lol, wish I could help you bro
[00:49:53] <ph88> :P
[00:51:08] <temp> what kind of slider are we talking about here ?
[00:52:08] <ph88> http://jqueryui.com/slider/
[00:52:46] <ph88> i can make JS to put the slider value inside a hidden input value to make it ready for form submission. Just wondering if this is the right way to do it
[00:54:33] <temp> well you can directly put the slider value while submit
[00:54:41] <ph88> how ?!
[00:55:26] <temp> I'm  not an expert in jQuery but onSubmit you can invoke a function,
[00:55:48] <temp> in that function can put in values but come to think of it, the hidden value with input sounds good.
[00:56:04] <ph88> oki
[00:56:10] <temp> as long as you are validating your values on the other end as well.
[00:56:27] <temp> and validating *correctly*
[00:59:50] <ph88> looks like this guy is putting it in a hidden type   https://github.com/genemu/GenemuFormBundle/blob/master/Resources/views/Form/div_layout.html.twig
[01:00:08] <ph88> MaxM: works now ?
[01:00:38] <temp> when in doubt stackoverflow
[01:05:11] <djQuery> ph88, have you seen this http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/HwBkH/
[01:06:16] <ph88> djQuery:  this doesn't work in firefox 19.0.2 it seems
[01:06:30] <djQuery> realy?
[01:06:32] <djQuery> dang
[01:06:37] <ph88> works in Iron 25.0.1400.0
[01:06:38] <spobat> aye aye!
[01:06:57] <djQuery> http://caniuse.com/#search=range
[01:07:21] <djQuery> FF is way behind then chrome has supported this since 5.0
[01:07:27] <ph88> http://caniuse.com/input-range
[01:07:41] <defaultro> what would be a nice subject of an email that would really make them open it? The email will be about how i felt really bad about the team since I didn't get a chance to utter it
[01:08:01] <defaultro> hi djQuery
[01:08:03] <defaultro> :)
[01:08:15] <ph88> djQuery:  maybe i can use this http://frankyan.com/labs/html5slider/
[01:08:36] <djQuery> ph88, http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/HwBkH/1/
[01:08:41] <djQuery> what about now
[01:09:03] <ph88> no
[01:09:17] <ph88> also in Iron (chrome) it shows an extra box that doesn't do anything
[01:09:31] <ph88> you missed some JS code i think
[01:09:34] <djQuery> grrr it didn't save the external js I added
[01:09:36] <ph88> it just display: var
[01:10:25] <djQuery> ph88, http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/HwBkH/3/
[01:10:40] <ph88> no JS there
[01:10:55] <ph88> oh external
[01:10:56] <ph88> hhmm
[01:11:03] <ph88> doesnt work still
[01:12:02] <djQuery> http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/demos/webforms.html
[01:12:53] <djQuery> ph88, ^^^^^
[01:13:10] <djQuery> that one supposedly does all the html5 features to bring it up to snuff
[01:13:36] <ph88> so you think html5slider.js was broken ?
[01:13:53] <djQuery> or i didnt read the doc at all
[01:14:02] <djQuery> but why bother with a half measure
[01:14:19] <ph88> :P
[01:14:27] <ph88> you got a point there lol
[01:14:28] <djQuery> it only fixed range this one fixes them all
[01:14:40] <djQuery> thats what she said
[01:15:06] <ph88> so does that mean all html5 elements are fully functional accross all browsers ?
[01:16:22] <djQuery> ph88, don't see a targeted browser list on it
[01:20:19] <djQuery> ph88, I have heard a lot of good things about modenizir though
[01:20:36] <ph88> i'm already using that in my project
[01:20:41] <spobat> where can I read on $. ?
[01:20:50] <spobat> I've seen this a lot but don't know what it really means.
[01:20:54] <ph88> oh hhmm
[01:21:03] <djQuery> spobat, jquery.com
[01:21:09] <spobat> where exactly?
[01:21:14] <spobat> does this thing have a name?
[01:21:21] <rue> spobat: $ is the jQuery object
[01:21:24] <djQuery> $ is the root jquery object
[01:21:28] <rue> It’s just a variable name
[01:21:33] <spobat> okay
[01:21:38] <ph88> it can be used by other object as well

[01:41:15] <spobat> how can  optimIize this piece of code? http://ideone.com/hOeA8Z
[01:41:15] <spobat>   the problem is that the browser has to rerender the site every time i change the dom.
[01:41:15] <spobat> by adding a lot of "entries" this doesn't get better
[01:47:18] <JD-Robbs> Hi all, I've got a bizzare problem. I am adding close-buttons to twitter bootstrap tabs. Now, all looks good. But sometimes these get removed and re-added according to what changes on the server. When that happens, they look mis-placed. However, the DOM looks *exactly* the same. If I manually "edit" the element in my browser and hit enter, they look normal again. Hence: is there a way to...
[01:47:20] <JD-Robbs> ...force re-rendering automatically? Many thanks for any pointers! :)
[01:49:29] <grid_> hey
[01:49:48] <grid_> can someone tell me how i get the vertical scrollbar button again here: http://fiddle.jshell.net/XHD5N/250/show/ ? it is beneath the page
[01:50:02] <grid_> you need to press jquery button
[01:56:26] <JD-Robbs> Oh, it was a rogue whitespace :D
[01:58:50] <grid_> i think i have to subtract a couple of pixel of the val height: jQuery(document).ready(function(){var height = $(window).height();
[01:58:57] <grid_> how i do that? let's say 10
[02:02:39] <enerel> hi yall
[02:03:33] <enerel> does anyone know which one is the best mobile app builder?
[02:04:05] <enerel> phonegap or tiggzi?
[02:06:15] <grid_> got it
[02:06:16] <grid_> jQuery(document).ready(function(){var height = $(window).height() - 100 ;
[02:42:06] <MaxM> could someone point out a way to learn how to detect which half of the window your mouse is on for both top and bottom
[02:42:14] <MaxM> and left and right
[02:44:25] <MaxM> like a e.windowX and e.windowY
[02:47:09] <Teza19> Hi all. I could be in the wrong place, but I'm after something like this: http://www.juniper.net/us/en/ <-- specifically, the banner transitioning from image to image and controllable with the dots. What is it called?
[02:49:37] <GoSox> so i'm using .hover() but it's only calling on items that exist when the page first loads. How do I get it to activate on newly created elements too?
[02:49:57] <GoSox> this is a common thing but i forget how you deal with it
[02:54:27] <GoSox> looks like i can do it two ways, one my calling .on on the parent element, specifying my buttons. Or I can use the live function. Is one solution better than the other? the live function seems simple (in a good way)
[02:55:18] <Gazpacho> yes one of those is better because the other is deprecated
[02:55:25] <GoSox> oh, which is deprecated?
[02:56:03] <GoSox> oh mannnnnn live doesn't even exist any more :(
[03:23:21] <GoSox> where can i find a simple list of events to use with .on()?
[03:23:25] <GoSox> i can't seem to find that anywhere
[03:25:08] <systemfault> Any DOM event.. even wikipedia has a list
[03:25:31] <systemfault> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOM_events#Common.2FW3C_events
[03:27:54] <ravenzz> even customevents
[03:28:02] <GoSox> i'm still not getting proper event binding for newly created elements
[03:28:17] <GoSox> $(".review_flag").on("mouseover","a",hover_img);
[03:28:41] <GoSox> does $(".review_flag") have to be something that is there all along? even as  the A's come and go?
[03:29:42] <systemfault> GoSox: $('.review_flags') needs to always be there as the even is bound to it.
[03:29:51] <GoSox> ohhh
[03:29:54] <GoSox> hmmm
[03:29:55] <systemfault> It must be there at the time of binding
[03:30:08] <systemfault> In the worst case, you can simply use document
[03:30:28] <systemfault> $(document).on('mouseover', 'a', hover_img);
[03:30:31] <GoSox> im sure i can find something… its just not as "elegant" as i'd like
[03:31:30] <systemfault> It's always documentOrParentElementThatWontBeReplaced.on(eventType, selector, handler)
[03:32:00] <GoSox> and if i want a hover, that means i need two .on()'s, one for mouseover and one for mouseout?
[03:32:16] <GoSox> or can i do .on("mouseover mouseout"
[03:32:43] <systemfault> You can do that but you "probably" don't want mouseover/mouseout but mouseenter/mouseleave
[03:33:03] <JD-Robbs> Odd question, but is tehre a plugin that allows me to properly have a "tree" in my console for jsonp values? It's a pain in the butt debugging my api, trying to read through a single line of json :D
[03:33:33] <GoSox> systemfault: i don't see those events on that wikipedia page
[03:33:36] <systemfault> $(document).on('mouseenter mouseleave', 'a', function(e) { if(e.type === 'mouseenter') {doSomething(); } else { doSomethingElse(); }  });
[03:34:55] <systemfault> GoSox: Because IIRC, it was a microsoft-ism that jquery normalized
[03:35:21] <GoSox> well in that case, back to my previous quesiton, IS there a list of events somewhere?
[03:35:37] <GoSox> a complete list of jquery events, that is
[03:35:48] <systemfault> The problem with mouseover is that it will fire a lot of time while hovering
[03:36:28] <GoSox> it doesn't seem to be doing that with mouseover
[03:36:39] <systemfault> http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/
[03:36:42] <GoSox> but still, if only i had a list of all the events i could choose from
[03:37:01] <GoSox> you would think that the docs for .on() would have a link to all the supported events
[03:37:44] <GoSox> mouseenter doesn't seem to be supported very well
[03:39:30] <systemfault> GoSox: jquery normalizes.. that's its job.
[03:39:41] <systemfault> If it wasn't of that, I wouldn't be using it.
[03:40:16] <systemfault> From the jQuery documentation:
[03:40:17] <systemfault> The mouseenter JavaScript event is proprietary to Internet Explorer. Because of the event's general utility, jQuery simulates this event so that it can be used regardless of browser. This event is sent to an element when the mouse pointer enters the element. Any HTML element can receive this event.
[03:40:18] <GoSox> it seems to be working fine with mouseover and mouseout, it's not refiring as you move the cursor around over the target element
[03:40:39] <systemfault> GoSox: Must be because your element doesn't have any child element.
[03:41:03] <systemfault> If you want something that acts like CSS :hover, you want mouseenter/mouseleave
[03:41:06] <GoSox> it does, but they are the same size, an <a> that has an <img> inside of it
[03:41:35] <GoSox> ok ill switch it
[03:41:49] <GoSox> i wish all this was on jquery.com somewhere
[03:42:16] <systemfault> http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[03:42:29] <systemfault> It specifies that mouseenter/mouseleave are used
[03:43:01] <systemfault> I agree with you, the documentation should have an explicit list of all the usable/normalized events
[03:43:11] <GoSox> yay thats all i wanted :)
[03:43:16] <GoSox> well that, and my code to work
[03:43:21] <GoSox> check. check.
[03:43:37] <GoSox> now, do i start something new with 17 minutes left
[03:43:42] <GoSox> probably shouldnt
[03:44:24] <systemfault> It's friday :P
[03:44:31] <systemfault> Hmm
[03:44:36] <systemfault> It's saturday actually :(
[03:44:52] <GoSox> friday, tuesday, blorpday, i'm self employed, it's all the same to me.
[03:45:22] <systemfault> Ah :)
[03:45:40] <GoSox> the only difference day of the week makes, it what's on TV
[03:46:13] <GoSox> systemfault: check out this bug: http://www.menulizard.com/accounts/profile/129/
[03:46:30] <GoSox> put your mouse over one of the [!] icons on the right, and look at the google ad while you do it
[03:47:19] <systemfault> o_O
[03:47:20] <GoSox> seems to only happen in chrome (not even safari)
[03:48:46] <Corrado> i have datepicker when select new date, in my textfield i see new date with append  old year like 19/01/20132013
[03:48:59] <GoSox> even on windows, it happens but only in chrome.
[03:49:14] <systemfault> I guess you could cheat it by adding a with to .ad_box
[03:49:22] <systemfault> .ad_box { width: 126px }
[03:49:55] <systemfault> *width
[03:50:21] <GoSox> i don't even know whats happening
[03:51:56] <systemfault> You use display: table and hovering the image makes the container grow for some reason
[03:52:23] <GoSox> it doesn't look like the ad grows, it looks like the column the ad is in, shrinks
[03:52:24] <systemfault> It shouldn't as the anchor has position: absolute :/
[03:52:32] <GoSox> which seems kind of imposible
[03:52:38] <systemfault> By growing, I meant the right one
[03:52:52] <systemfault> So the left column gets thinner
[03:52:55] <GoSox> but the content in the middle and right column don't move accordingly
[03:53:15] <systemfault> By setting a specific width to the column, it seems to fix the issue on chrome
[03:54:41] <Corrado> datepicker append two times year
[03:55:24] <GoSox> systemfault: what did you add the width to? i added it to the div that makes up the column but it didn't fix the issue
[03:56:02] <systemfault> GoSox: Either on the first div in .layout or on .ad_box
[03:56:20] <GoSox> yeah i did .layout > div:nth-child(1) and gave it 126px of width
[03:57:39] <systemfault> wtf… hover the ! to see it mess up the layout then open the inspector and uncheck then check the box setting the width..
[03:58:38] <GoSox> just chalk it up to bug and expect it will be fixed soon?
[03:58:41] <systemfault> display:table/table-cell are strange :/
[03:58:57] <systemfault> GoSox: I would try adding the width to .ad_box just in case...
[03:59:02] <GoSox> yeah but they are IMO the best way to make variable-width layouts
[03:59:15] <systemfault> GoSox: For now, yeah.. :(
[03:59:33] <GoSox> systemfault: do you have access to IE8 or below?
[03:59:42] <systemfault> Eventually, flexbox will be better
[03:59:47] <systemfault> Yeah, in a vm
[03:59:58] <GoSox> check the page in older IE, just for a smile
[04:01:23] <systemfault> Haha :P
[04:01:36] <systemfault> I wouldn't personally dare not supporting IE8 at the moment
[04:01:52] <GoSox> its use is pretty low. around 5% on my sites
[04:02:05] <systemfault> Great :)
[04:02:09] <GoSox> and this site isn't popular yet, so 5% of a small amount of traffic, is a small amount of traffic
[04:03:17] <GoSox> ok my gf is making me pancakes, time to bounce
[04:03:24] <GoSox> thanks for the help
[04:03:38] <systemfault> You're welcome :D
[04:05:28] <JD-Robbs> I don't understand. It's not pancake day!
[04:05:30] <JD-Robbs> ^^
[04:05:37] <GoSox> every day is pancake day
[04:05:42] <GoSox> oh and did i mention bacon?
[04:05:46] <JD-Robbs> You lucky ol' fella!
[04:05:57] <JD-Robbs> Christ on a bike.
[04:06:01] <JD-Robbs> better get to it then!
[04:06:02] <JD-Robbs> ;)
[05:15:23] <omani_> I load a fancybox with a link on my page. now after load, I want to close that fancybox again with another link provided in the box
[05:15:26] <omani_> what must I do?
[05:16:45] <hugo_moss> can you rephrase that
[05:16:56] <hugo_moss> i dont quite understand what you want to do
[05:17:09] <omani_> I load a page with fancybox (iframe)
[05:17:19] <omani_> now this page in facybox has a link "return"
[05:17:28] <hugo_moss> oh ok
[05:17:30] <omani_> on click I want to dismis the box and return to underlygin page again
[05:17:56] <hugo_moss> call the close method,
[05:18:03] <omani_> I do, but it doesn not work
[05:18:04] <hugo_moss> i think its documented somewhere
[05:18:14] <omani_> I call $.fancybox().close()
[05:18:19] <omani_> I call $.fancybox.close()
[05:21:31] <hugo_moss> theres a demo on fancyapps.com
[05:21:33] <hugo_moss> on how to do this
[05:21:57] <omani_> thanks
[05:22:03] <hugo_moss> http://www.fancyapps.com/fancybox/
[05:22:11] <hugo_moss> go to about the middle to bottom of the page
[05:22:15] <hugo_moss> and look at iframe
[05:22:18] <hugo_moss> click that
[05:22:23] <hugo_moss> then look at the source
[05:22:42] <hugo_moss> they have a demo that has a "close go to parent" link in the iframe
[05:23:04] <hugo_moss> its called "close iframe parent"
[05:24:21] <omani_> ok works. thanks
[05:24:49] <hugo_moss> they use "<a href="javascript:parent.jQuery.fancybox.close();">"
[05:24:51] <omani_> but
[05:24:53] <hugo_moss> yep no problem
[05:25:00] <omani_> what is href="javascript:parent.jQuery.fancybox.close();" within script tag?
[05:25:18] <omani_> it seems it isn't just "$.fancybox.close();"
[05:25:29] <omani_> I'd like to avoid javascript code in a href.
[05:25:35] <hugo_moss> good point
[05:26:19] <omani_> so I need to know how to write "the parent thing" in javascript.
[05:26:46] <JD-Robbs> Hi all, I have an app that is included as a Javascript file and uses (cross domain) jsonp calls for everything. Now, the "actual" server-app uses an authentication cookie. I suppose this won't be affected by Mozilla's news on 3rd party cookies?
[05:26:58] <hugo_moss> try your code without www. in the address bar, just use the domain
[05:27:02] <JD-Robbs> Since all requests are GET requests that return jsonp. Any pointers much apropecuiated! :)
[05:27:03] <hugo_moss> as a test
[05:27:22] <hugo_moss> it might be because of cross domain rules
[05:29:30] <hugo_moss> ok
[05:30:02] <guardian> hello, I'm using scroll() to change background-position, to achieve parallax background… however it doesn't work on iOS because DOM manipulation are frozen while scrolling. is there a workaround that?
[05:30:11] <hugo_moss> in the javascript js file, create an onclick handler and call "parent.jQuery.fancybox.close()" for the anchor tag
[05:30:31] <JD-Robbs> hugo_moss: You're not talkling to me, are you? ;)
[05:30:55] <hugo_moss> https://www.no-gods-no-masters.com/ <---- this page uses it, click the contact button on the left and inspect the source, where they have the close button
[05:31:02] <hugo_moss> theyre doing exactly what you want to do
[05:31:07] <hugo_moss> no, sorry i was talking to
[05:31:16] <hugo_moss> omani_
[05:32:02] <omani_> ?
[05:32:14] <omani_> hugo_moss: I did
[05:32:20] <omani_> exactly like that.
[05:32:40] <omani_> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/238231?ln=on&tidy=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it!
[05:32:40] <hugo_moss> omani_: they do what you want to do, but create a event handler in the js file, instead of using the onclick handler in the html
[05:32:52] <omani_> syntax is broken through nopaste website. fyi
[05:39:02] <hugo_moss> omani, when you click the close button, is there any message in the console
[05:39:14] <hugo_moss> error message
[05:40:33] <grid_> how i get fixed position when i resize my browser horizontally? http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/tabs/sortable.html
[05:40:52] <grid_> only talking about the tabs
[05:41:32] <omani_> no
[05:41:34] <omani_> no message.
[05:42:08] <hugo_moss> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5192926/fancybox-close-not-working
[05:42:17] <hugo_moss> they got it working using this
[05:49:32] <boytoy> shoky: yo!
[05:50:10] <boytoy> shoky: just got back, data-tap-toggle worked :) oh boy oh boy oh boy :)
[06:36:00] <sadtaco> I have "foo){bar){etc" how do I split it into ["foo","bar){etc"] instead of ["foo","bar", "etc"]?  Meaning, I just want to split on the first match. I figured .split(/\){?/);, but nope.
[06:37:24] <djQuery> var a = [obj]
[06:39:05] <djQuery> sadtaco, don't see a difference between your 1st and snd strings
[06:47:59] <cambazz> hello, can you guys reccommend me an upload plugin for jq? I tried uploadify and uploadifive, but from my experience, uploadifive works nice, but a bit hard to modify, because authors wrote bad code
[06:52:00] <daanavitch> I have two animations that execute when the left or right key is pressed. Now when the left or right key gets pressed a few times while the animation is running, it should execute the animation for the last pressed key when the animation is done.
[06:52:00] <daanavitch> How could I do this in jQuery?
[06:52:52] <cambazz> daanavitch: you have to put event listeners for these keys, and execute certain methods
[06:53:12] <cambazz> although i cant tell you specifics, that would be how it is done
[06:54:01] <daanavitch> I already have those, but I can't figure out how to execute the animation for left or right key when the previous animation is done depending on what key was pressed last
[06:54:51] <cambazz> you have to execute another method, when animation is done
[06:55:04] <cambazz> you can put flags like executing_animation = false; and
[06:55:23] <cambazz> then exec'ing animation, you set it to true, and when done you set it to false
[06:55:44] <cambazz> so your other method, should check if animation is executing or not, from the flag
[06:56:40] <daanavitch> okay that makes sense, thanks!
[06:57:47] <djQuery> daanavitch, see .stop
[06:58:39] <djQuery> daanavitch, also see .queue
[07:18:51] <cambazz> djQuery: is there an upload plugin that you can recomend? i am trying out uploadifive, but imho it sucks
[07:25:07] <Zxurian> assuming an array of ids [1, 3, 5, 6, 7], whats the best method for selecting all div's that have id's of those numbers? (<div id="1">, etc..)
[07:29:47] <sacho> reduce the array to a selector string
[07:31:10] <discorpia> Zxurian: not sure purely numerical ids are advised in general, but you could just implode the array with ', #' and add '#' to the beginning to make it a string like '#1, #3, #5, #6, #7'
[07:31:19] <Zxurian> my question would be  how do I form the selector string to fetch all of them, or is it just forming a long string of $("#1, #3, #5, #6, #7"),
[07:31:56] <Zxurian> the numerical ids were just an example. I can create a long string, just wasn't sure if there was a better method of selecting multiple element types with different ids
[07:32:38] <sacho> you can loop over the array, and add elements to a jquery object
[07:33:43] <Zxurian> okay, thanks, I'll try those out
[07:35:43] <discorpia> Zxurian: yes, jquery uses same syntax as css selectors, so '#1, #4, #xxxxx' is valid for selecting multiple elements
[07:37:04] <systemfault> And ids starting with numbers are invalid..
[07:59:31] <djQuery> well gues he is gone       selector = '#' + arr.join(', #');
[08:06:33] <Trudko> Hi guys, I am creating first plugin. I have learned here http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Defaults_and_Options , that if I have multiple methods  I should call them by passing string to plugin and if I want to use options I should pass that to plugin too. What if I want to do both?
[08:08:57] <Trudko> here is code http://jsfiddle.net/9BFnD/
[08:12:26] <ravenzz> Trudko 1st of all methods is an object literal
[08:12:45] <ravenzz> so really you can't define properties in that way
[08:12:54] <ravenzz> I mean $.fn.fromCloner = function (method) {
[08:13:12] <ravenzz> in js object literals are key: value pairs
[08:13:48] <Trudko> ravenzz: ou sorry I pasted the code wrong of the $.fn.fromCloner  should be outside of methods obj.
[08:13:51] <ravenzz> the plugin should be declared outside
[08:13:54] <ravenzz> yep
[08:14:14] <ravenzz> can you give me the correct paste?
[08:16:00] <Trudko> ravenzz: something like htis i guess http://jsfiddle.net/9BFnD/1/
[08:18:39] <ravenzz> ok doesn't matter... actually the definition on the 1st fiddle was enough to answer your question
[08:19:28] <ravenzz> Trudko look here http://pastie.org/7182028
[08:19:31] <ravenzz> line 3
[08:20:42] <ravenzz> if methods contains method then you invoke methods[method] passing the Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1) as arguments
[08:20:43] <Trudko> ravenzz: ok I am looking
[08:21:35] <ravenzz> so if you call $foo.fromCloner("show", { foo: "foo"});
[08:22:24] <Trudko> ravenzz: yeah ok now i see it and the first param is obj init function is called where I should set the settings ?
[08:22:33] <ravenzz> the plugin will look into methods for the method show and if it does exists it will call him passing arguments ("show" and { foo: "foo"}) sliced by 1 .. so only { foo: "foo"}
[08:23:55] <ravenzz> Trudko the 5th line is executed when the method doesn't exists or it is an object (which holds the options usually)
[08:24:16] <ravenzz> tipically when you initialize the plugin
[08:24:32] <Trudko> ravenzz: yeah so my question was how to pass options to plugin if you have custom methods, so the 5 line handles that case
[08:25:22] <ravenzz> eg $('img').overlay({ closeOnClick: true, otherOption: "foo" });
[08:25:48] <ravenzz> in this case the parameter is an object so the if at line 2 evaluate to false
[08:26:13] <ravenzz> the check at line 4 instead evaluates to true
[08:26:32] <ravenzz> because { closeOnClick: true, otherOption: "foo" } is an object
[08:27:20] <ravenzz> if you want to call a method and pass an options object
[08:28:01] <ravenzz> $elem.pluginName("close", { fade: true });
[08:28:05] <ravenzz> for example
[08:29:49] <ravenzz> Trudko I am sorry but my english is not that good...let me know if it is still unclear, i'll make an example for you
[08:31:41] <Trudko> ravenzz: i think i get it can you just please take a look at init functiom here if I got the point http://jsfiddle.net/9BFnD/2/
[08:35:57] <ravenzz> yea Trudko it should work but this shoudl be way better http://jsfiddle.net/9BFnD/3/
[08:38:08] <guardian> i'm a jquery beginner. if I do $('img').each(function(i, e) { … });
[08:38:23] <ravenzz> Trudko here is a bunch of jQuery plugin patterns you can read an learn from https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/patterns
[08:38:26] <guardian> do I have to do $(e) inside the function implementation?
[08:38:49] <Trudko> greate
[08:39:43] <Trudko> ravenzz: what about  settings = $.extend({}, defaults, options); line?
[08:40:09] <Trudko> because now setting is missing from code and it is global variable now.
[08:40:51] <ravenzz> oops true
[08:40:52] <ravenzz> sorry
[08:41:04] <Trudko> dont be sorry you help me :D
[08:42:15] <ravenzz> Trudko well luckly you knew that! a noob wouldn't have noticed that
[08:43:34] <Trudko> ravenzz: so you did want to leave settings there? you just separated defaults to different object , in order to code to be more clear?
[08:43:34] <ravenzz> anyway look at this http://jqueryboilerplate.com/ or any other pattern
[08:45:20] <Trudko> I will thanks.
[08:47:49] <ravenzz> Trudko something like this http://jsfiddle.net/AsfKs/ I guess
[08:49:55] <ravenzz> oh and here is an example of method + options (or any other thing) http://jsfiddle.net/AsfKs/1/
[08:51:12] <Trudko> why you didnt use  $.fn.test and use $.test ?
[08:57:06] <Trudko> ravenzz: why you didnt use  $.fn.test and use $.test ? and settings is still global
[09:05:43] <ravenzz> Trudko oh that's just a function $.fn.test instead works only on jQuery objects
[09:15:25] <bluesm> Is there in jquery option to use ECMAscript 5 and have compatibility say with IE 8 ?
[09:15:53] <bluesm> I mean are there methods for "Object.defineProperties()"  and so on
[09:15:55] <bluesm> ?
[09:29:12] <medicineuk> Hi guys I know this isn't really the right place but I was wondering if some one could answer a simple question about the webkit inspector
[09:35:25] <mrha> hi, I'm making a custom nivo slideshow.  is there a way to change the footer text depending on what slide it's on?
[09:35:33] <mrha> using jquery
[09:40:52] <medicineuk> Anyone know how you get the yellow popup to appear when inspecting variables in chrome?apparently you just hover over the variable to see it's current state but for whatever reason I can't get this to work.
[09:44:59] <alainus> how can I bind to an event, and have that bind be persistent if the DOM is rewritten ? I'm binding to $(a.class) and then reloading it on the DOM and it loses it.
[09:51:35] <Trudko> why do i get   uncaught TypeError: Object function ( selector, context ) { error when i se $.fn.cloner instead of $.cloner ?   code http://jsfiddle.net/AsfKs/1/
[10:08:30] <djQuery> Trudko, so your asking, why does it hurt when I do this? But when I do that it works find and doesnt hurt?
[10:08:36] <djQuery> Trudko, stop doing this
[10:16:31] <Trudko> djQuery: ?
[10:16:47] <Trudko> djQuery: sorry I wanted to learn something, my bad.
[10:21:48] <edoop> WHAT'S YOUr best common library to use in th html project?
[10:24:57] <systemfault> What is a common library?
[10:28:41] <Trudko> ok nevermind i figre it out.
[10:37:58] <edoop> systemfault.  i mean the common lib to use
[10:38:08] <edoop> eg: creative.js
[10:38:13] <edoop> jquery
[10:39:11] <systemfault> For most websites, a DOM abstraction/normalization lib like jQuery is enough
[10:40:01] <edoop> jquery is good for intermediate work interface?
[10:40:35] <systemfault> Again, it depends, for a normal website, yeah…. For a single-page application with reusable components, no
[10:41:25] <systemfault> HTML/CSS/Javascript(+jQuery) can go a long way
[10:41:39] <edoop> i m  an actionscript developer
[10:41:49] <edoop> and i want use more of my work and experience on html
[10:42:09] <systemfault> You won't be able...
[10:42:30] <systemfault> You could do some canvas-based games...
[10:42:35] <edoop> i ve seen some js project creative like webGL
[10:42:47] <systemfault> Right… canvas-based games ;)
[10:42:55] <edoop> yes i do
[10:42:59] <systemfault> Canvas can be 2d or 3d(webgl)
[10:43:04] <edoop> good
[10:43:11] <edoop> i want code in this
[10:43:25] <edoop> for work opportunity
[10:43:38] <systemfault> Take a look at three.js
[10:43:52] <edoop> system i ve seen processing.js
[10:44:10] <systemfault> The sad thing is that webgl isn't supported by IE
[10:44:29] <edoop> :(
[10:44:46] <systemfault> IE only supports 2d canvas (ie9 and later)
[10:44:52] <edoop> actually , what is supported?
[10:45:27] <edoop> do you have a example of 2d canvas, that you can suggest ?
[10:45:55] <systemfault> Take a look at paper.js
[10:46:01] <systemfault> http://paperjs.org/
[10:46:30] <edoop> really good
[10:46:33] <edoop> i undestand now
[10:47:45] <edoop> how long time we will have webGL on IE?
[10:48:19] <systemfault> Right now.. probably never.
[10:48:39] <systemfault> BUT.. there's hope… there are rumors that webgl could be in IE11
[10:50:10] <edoop> system , very good if i can use my experience in dhtml
[10:50:21] <edoop> creative
[10:51:08] <jhave> Hello
[10:51:48] <daslicht> hello,
[10:52:11] <daslicht> I do a ajax call to my php backend which serves as result : {"result":true,"responseCode":200}
[10:52:36] <daslicht> if do a console.log(e) in my success handler {"result":true,"responseCode":200} is printed
[10:52:39] <jhave> It is possible to make an image hover effect on 2 images, same size but on in color and on in gray
[10:52:50] <daslicht> but when i try to access e.result i get undefined ?! why?
[10:54:14] <daslicht> when i look at the bnetworks tab in firebug , the response is listed as json
[10:54:25] <daslicht> do i have to convert it again somehow ?
[10:58:03] <fluffypony> if I have $('#menu ul li').hover(), how do I prevent that from running on #menu ul > li ul > li and further down the chain?
[10:58:18] <systemfault> daslicht: Do you specify on the backend and frontend that you're sending/receiving json
[10:58:30] <daslicht> jes its sending json
[10:58:42] <daslicht> do i have to set the content type in jquery ?
[10:58:47] <daslicht> in teh ajax call
[10:59:11] <systemfault> daslicht: I mean, on the backend by setting the appropriate Content-Type header… and on the frontend by adding dataType: 'json' to the $.ajax config
[11:00:06] <daslicht> my return value is: json_encode($return)
[11:00:13] <daslicht> so it should be fine no?
[11:00:19] <systemfault> Nope...
[11:00:29] <daslicht> do i have to manually set the header?>
[11:00:41] <systemfault> daslicht: before the echo, add     header("Content-Type: application/json", true);
[11:00:47] <systemfault> Yeah...
[11:00:51] <daslicht> i dont do a echo
[11:00:55] <daslicht> i use symfony2
[11:00:57] <daslicht> hm
[11:01:01] <systemfault> Ah, then perhaps symfony does it
[11:01:21] <systemfault> Anyway.. try specifying the dataType config option with jQuery
[11:01:25] <daslicht> yeah
[11:01:29] <daslicht> dataType: 'json'  like this ?
[11:01:33] <systemfault> Don't use header() if you use symfony
[11:01:35] <systemfault> Right
[11:01:46] <daslicht> ok
[11:02:28] <daslicht> do i need to stringify the json before i send it to the server ?
[11:02:46] <systemfault> You're sending json TO the server?
[11:02:59] <systemfault> I thought you were trying to get json FROM the server
[11:03:26] <daslicht> both :)
[11:03:46] <systemfault> If you want to send json to the server, you need to JSON.stringify it...
[11:03:49] <daslicht> seams to work now !
[11:03:56] <daslicht> cool
[11:03:56] <daslicht> !
[11:03:57] <systemfault>  and jQuery will send it as form-data
[11:04:33] <daslicht> do you know how i can print objects using FirePHP ?
[11:05:11] <systemfault> No, sorry
[11:05:32] <daslicht> ok cool
[11:05:35] <daslicht> fair enough
[11:05:41] <daslicht> enuff work for today
[11:05:43] <daslicht> :)
[11:05:44] <systemfault> :D
[11:05:48] <daslicht> now its food time
[11:05:55] <daslicht> happy easter days !±

[11:11:31] <jhave> Is is possible to make a change so if i hover the image the image change to filename.png
[11:12:24] <systemfault> We're in 2013… nobody uses JS to do simple hover states..
[11:12:45] <Determinist> systemfault: you'd be surprised
[11:12:52] <systemfault> :(
[11:12:53] <Determinist> and hi :)

[11:32:54] <spirat> Hello guys, I have a strange problem. When doing ajaxSetup, I bind a BeforeSend function that adds a header to requests for POSTs. This $.ajaxSetup() only works if I do it in the function where the $.ajax() POST is done. Why?? I want to be able to do the setup in an external .js file that I include in all my headers
[11:41:45] <lolmaus> Hi. I'm writing a theme for an old CMS that uses jQuery 1.3.2. I've encountered a problem: .offset().top returns 1212.5999755859375, but .mousemove (when pointed at the top of the element) returns 1153. Because of this difference, i can't position elements correctly. Why is it different?
[11:58:07] <ragas> i registered jq in wordpress, but it seems that it hasnt loaded.  im getting ReferenceError: $ is not defined in the console from my script.  But when i run the same script in the console its fine.
[12:05:35] <Quest> hi
[12:06:27] <Quest>  I need a little guidance as I am new to JS. Like what usually happens in a forum, I have built a textarea and some comments  (comming from database) below the textarea. what I want is to add another <tr> with <td> element to the <table> of comments already visible, when the user types something in the textarea and hit submit button.
[12:08:19] <jacta> How can I collect all images into an array thats from an div
[12:14:28] <JD-Robbs> Did anyone ehre get cross-domain cookies to work with Safari and jsonp? :)
[12:17:18] <Trudko> Guys simple plugin http://jsbin.com/ahoyez/1/edit why does  line console.log(cloneId); in method add  return  div object rather then  my parameter
[12:18:59] <Quest>  I need a little guidance as I am new to JS. Like what usually happens in a forum, I have built a textarea and some comments  (comming from database) below the textarea. what I want is to add another <tr> with <td> element to the <table> of comments already visible, when the user types something in the textarea and hit submit button.
[12:19:00] <Quest> http://pastebin.ca/2345701
[12:20:21] <Trudko> Quest: something like $("#myTable" ).append("<tr><td>Value</td></tr>") ?
[12:20:59] <Quest> Trudko,  where it will append it?
[12:21:08] <Trudko> to element with id myTable
[12:21:11] <systemfault> append means "Add at the end" ?
[12:21:12] <systemfault> ;)
[12:21:30] <Trudko> yes :)
[12:21:38] <Quest> Trudko,  systemfault  ya. what if i need it to be added to the top?
[12:21:45] <systemfault> Not sure if that works directly or you need to add it to <tbody> (I don'tplay much with tables)
[12:21:51] <systemfault> Quest: I think jquery has prepend
[12:21:59] <Trudko> ^^
[12:22:32] <Trudko> systemfault: it workes with table question is what happen if there is tbody ...
[12:22:34] <Quest> k
[12:22:57] <systemfault> Trudko: There's always a tbody afaik
[12:23:00] <Quest> i need to know the system to  preppend chilt at top. and not bottom. and how to do all that on the hit on submit button?
[12:23:14] <systemfault> Trudko: If you don't specify it, the browser will add it
[12:23:37] <Trudko> well added by browswer but if its there does jquery appends to tbody or after it ?
[12:24:04] <Trudko> not sure have to go will try it later
[12:24:09] <systemfault> I don't know… I can't remember the last time I had to dynamically play with tables
[12:25:10] <Quest> Trudko,  how to do the same thing in javascript  $("#myTable" ).append("<tr><td>Value</td></tr>") ?
[12:27:38] <systemfault> o_O
[12:27:45] <systemfault> Why do you ask that in jQuery?
[12:29:53] <jacta> Can anyone give me a hint, http://jsfiddle.net/Duebp/ - how can I get the output as "file", "file", "file", "file"
[12:30:15] <jacta> right now I just get it as an object
[12:30:43] <systemfault> jackfranklin: .get()
[12:30:51] <systemfault> tn_array.get()
[12:31:01] <systemfault> It should return the array
[12:31:35] <Quest> systemfault,  iam new to JS and Jquery
[12:31:53] <Quest> systemfault,  should i learn js or jquery first? or just jquery
[12:32:12] <systemfault> Depends.. if you need to get shit done "NAO", then use jQuery
[12:32:22] <systemfault> If not, then learn pure DOM then jQuery after
[12:32:32] <systemfault> http://domenlightenment.com/ is a good tutorial for pure DOM
[12:33:02] <systemfault> tables are touchy with pure DOM because you cannot portably use innerHTML with them
[12:33:04] <tw2113> i'll say you can get a lot done with just learning "jQuery" but learning pure js will help you debug and understand what jQuery is doing later
[12:33:15] <Quest> systemfault,  " if you need to get shit done "NAO", then use jQuery"?
[12:33:20] <jacta> systemfault, it gives me it like this: example.com/1.jpg,4.jpg,3.jpg,2.jpg
[12:33:37] <jacta> seems liek its not "" between, as it need "", "", "", ""
[12:33:46] <djQuery> here is a good javascript tut http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[12:34:05] <systemfault> jacta: .get() returns an array.. if you need to format that array into a string then it's another step
[12:34:10] <djQuery> course the source of jquery is a good tutorial as well
[12:34:53] <jacta> systemfault, http://jsfiddle.net/Duebp/1/ - tried that way - I think I just need it as a string maybe
[12:35:17] <systemfault> What is the expected output?
[12:35:56] <jacta> "1.jpg", "2.jpg", "3.jpg", "4.jpg"
[12:36:12] <gerep> is this a way to check if the data-toggle = tooltip the tooltip() will be executed?          $('a').attr('data-toggle', 'tooltip').tooltip();
[12:36:35] <systemfault> jacta: That's what the jsfiddle returns
[12:36:54] <jacta> systemfault,  ill update the code, 2 sec
[12:36:55] <gerep> because I have two kinds of <a> the tooltip and popover, I need to check which one it is to know what to call, tooltip() or popover()
[12:37:28] <djQuery> gerep, nope   $('a').find('[data-toggle="tooltip"]').tooltip()
[12:37:39] <gerep> djQuery, thanks ;)
[12:38:20] <jacta> systemfault, this is was I'm trying to: http://jsfiddle.net/Duebp/3/
[12:38:36] <djQuery> gerep, but it would be a lott better if you would do  <a class="tooltip-toggle'>
[12:38:53] <gerep> djQuery, so I'll do that
[12:39:01] <sadtaco> the array length.  The number of splits
[12:39:21] <klnlnll> are there any good photo gallery plugins for jquery that show a preview and if you click on it, show the whole image?
[12:40:01] <sadtaco> But I solved it with using indexOf('){') and slicing
[12:40:13] <systemfault> jacta: That's strange :/
[12:40:22] <jacta> systemfault, what is?
[12:40:24] <systemfault> jacta: Not sure what it's supposed to do..
[12:40:44] <systemfault> jacta: You have no callbacks, how do you know the images are done loading?
[12:41:23] <jacta> Its just for loading em, I have the small thumbs in the div, and remove the word thumb to load them in background when user come into page
[12:41:32] <jacta> instead of a hidden div
[12:42:01] <systemfault> jacta: But how do you know the images are done preloading?
[12:42:16] <systemfault> You don't track the .load events :/
[12:42:30] <jacta> I dont, but I dont need to, cause its used with an hover over the small images
[12:42:43] <jacta> so if its not loaded it loading it on the fly, otherwise its loaded
[12:44:36] <Quest> systemfault,  how to create a <tr> <td>   some var here </td> </tr>     inside a table with "mytable" id.  should I use this or  how can I use this document.createElement("tr"); ?
[12:44:46] <Quest> Trudko,
[12:44:49] <Quest> ^
[12:45:50] <jacta> systemfault, get it?
[12:45:59] <djQuery> Quest, how about just $('sometable tbody').append('<tr><td>'+ somevar +'</td></tr>'
[12:46:00] <systemfault> More or less..
[12:47:15] <jacta> systemfault, and on my own page it tries to load: Request URL:http://example.com/1.jpg,4.jpg,3.jpg,2.jpg
[12:47:23] <jacta> with the given code
[12:47:39] <Quest> djinni_,  i need to prepend. is there a prepend. and secondly at the moment iam using pure JS
[12:47:59] <systemfault> Quest: Nope, pure DOM has only insertBefore
[12:48:13] <jacta> systemfault, http://engineeredweb.com/blog/09/12/preloading-images-jquery-and-javascript/
[12:48:48] <jacta> so I want it to automaticly find all images in #images and "doenload" them
[12:49:22] <systemfault> I see
[12:50:32] <jacta> just can't figure out to get the string output as it want
[12:56:06] <jacta> systemfault, can you help me output as string instead?
[12:56:53] <systemfault> I don't understand what you want.. I did tons of preloaders...
[12:56:58] <systemfault> But none like yours.
[12:57:40] <leonardshelby84> hey, in jquery 1.9, what's the best way to scroll to the bottom of the page?
[12:57:48] <leonardshelby84> nothing i've tried appears to work
[12:58:06] <djQuery> leonardshelby84, hve you looked at scroll to?
[12:58:27] <djQuery> ?scrollTo
[12:58:52] <leonardshelby84> i think scrollTo is depreceated?
[12:58:56] <leonardshelby84> there's a scrollTop
[12:59:00] <leonardshelby84> and animate
[12:59:09] <leonardshelby84> but i've tried all kinda of combinations and it doesn't do anything
[12:59:28] <leonardshelby84> i'm trying to do it once i've received a successful response from an ajax request, not on click
[12:59:56] <djQuery> http://stackoverflow.com/a/6677069/295800
[12:59:59] <jacta> systemfault, output all images from #images into a string like "file", "file", "file"
[13:00:17] <djQuery> leonardshelby84, then just animate too the bottom of the screen
[13:01:41] <leonardshelby84> djQuery: this is what i have at the moment: http://pastebin.com/GLUrP7aw
[13:01:56] <leonardshelby84> in my ajaxsuccess process
[13:02:35] <ggoodman> PSA: I've just launched a major overhaul of Plunker (http://plunker.co/edit/) which is a re-imagination of jsFiddle with arbitrary # of files, real-time linting/previewing and even live collaboration
[13:02:58] <leonardshelby84> aha, don't worry djquery
[13:03:03] <leonardshelby84> it's conflicting with other animations
[13:03:11] <leonardshelby84> i've removed and it's working :)
[13:03:12] <leonardshelby84> thanks
[13:04:16] <jacta> systemfault, is it stupid you think?
[13:04:28] <systemfault> jacta: How is that string going to help you?
[13:04:54] <systemfault> How is it different that what the array returned?
[13:05:42] <jacta> right now it tried to load: example.com/1.jpg,4.jpg,3.jpg,2.jpg - Thats not what it should
[13:09:31] <jacta> it should load example.com/1.jpg example.com/2.jpg example.com/3.jpg example.com/4.jpg - so my output must be wrong
[13:12:08] <jacta> so can you help me output just a string, systemfault
[13:14:50] <lolmaus> I've got trouble with .offset(). Have a look at balloons at the bottom of the page (in the table): http://bc.sandy.local/ . All browsers positon them differently! Opera positions correctly, Firefox too low and Chrome too high! Why!?
[13:16:01] <lolmaus> Code: http://jsbin.com/oxacev/3/edit
[13:17:40] <systemfault> jacta: Perhaps someone else can help you… because I see no logic in what you want to do.
[13:19:47] <jacta> systemfault, you dont need to, can you just help me to output files from #images into a string formatted like this: "file", "file", "file" - thats all
[13:20:10] <systemfault> Sure
[13:21:06] <systemfault> jacta: Here http://jsfiddle.net/Duebp/5/
[13:23:50] <maxwell_> Hi
[13:24:01] <maxwell_> can anybody hel me with this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/rBD2D/
[13:24:01] <nook> Hi, i have a Problem, i have one function that makes an ajax-request to my server, but i dont get it, to return the responseText, because its undefinde, but y, thats my source: http://pastebin.com/iSxcn4ns
[13:28:21] <lolmaus> systemfault, could you please help me with the .offset returning incorrect values? In Opera, the value is correct until i launch Dragonfly (Opera's Firebug alternative). When Dragonfly reloads the page to fetch JS, the .offset() returned value becomes wrong (and equal to Firefox). When i close Dragonfly and reload the page, the value is correct again. O_O
[13:28:45] <systemfault> I don't have opera, sorry :(
[13:29:06] <systemfault> And the problem should solve itself soon :P opera is switching to webkit :P
[13:29:33] <lolmaus> systemfault, i'm not asking specifically about Opera. Opera is the only one that's correct. Firefox and Chrome produce different results each!
[13:29:49] <systemfault> Strange :(
[13:29:59] <systemfault> lolmaus: Do you have a live link?
[13:31:29] <lolmaus> systemfault, http://bc.lolma.us/ The problem is with the tooltips at the bottom of the page. Each tooltip should be located directly above table rows. Here's the code: http://jsbin.com/oxacev/3/edit
[13:32:09] <lolmaus> systemfault, .offset and .mousemove (when pointed at the top of the element) produce different results!
[13:32:34] <lolmaus> systemfault, the elements are table rows.
[13:33:19] <systemfault> Looks like a PITA problem :(
[13:34:36] <smakatak> how can i iterate over table column starting at some x position?
[13:34:46] <smakatak> .each starts me from the begining
[13:42:39] <lolmaus> systemfault, i've managed to debug my issue and narrow the problem to a couple lines of code!
[13:42:54] <systemfault> Good :)
[13:44:35] <lolmaus> systemfault: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4fae4164fe79dc859335 WHY?!?!?!
[13:45:53] <systemfault> lolmaus: Perhaps because the table didn't have the time to render.. I'm not sure :/
[13:46:20] <systemfault> lolmaus: Try something stupid… like adding that in a setTimeout(function() {}, 2000);
[13:46:30] <systemfault> Then see if the calculation is done right
[13:48:27] <guardian> I need to get a layout working with IE7 :( and as part of $(document).ready() I'm setting $(this).height(foo); on an image
[13:48:51] <guardian> right after having set the height, I alert ($(this).height()); and it doesn't show foo's value...
[13:49:01] <guardian> unless I also set the img width
[13:49:16] <guardian> does that quirk ring a bell? my google powers are failing at me
[13:49:34] <lolmaus> systemfault, you're right!!!
[13:50:17] <systemfault> lolmaus: Then perhaps you could cheat  :( set the timeout lower and lower… until it's as low as it can be without messing up
[13:50:56] <lolmaus> lolmaus, the tooltip will pop up only on mouse move, so 2s is great. Thank you systemfault, i've been struggling with this all night!
[13:51:44] <systemfault> You're welcome :P
[13:53:38] <Shilon> hello
[13:56:10] <divout> lolmaus: try `load` instead of `ready`
[14:04:59] <doitux> hi, i want to get an element by id AND name. is this the correct jquery way: $("#wantedID [name='wantedName']")  ?
[14:07:28] <systemfault> doitux: It doesn't make sense.
[14:07:44] <systemfault> doitux: If you have more than a single element with the same ID, your HTML is invalid.
[14:21:03] <doitux> systemfault: ok i will rewrite that. thx
[14:26:24] <lolmaus> systemfault, once again, thank you. Now it works as a charm.
[14:29:45] <systemfault> :D
[14:35:46] <maxwell_> systemfault:  dou you mind helping me with a fiddle?
[14:36:01] <systemfault> If it's not a thousand lines of JS, sure
[14:36:10] <maxwell_> haha not at all
[14:37:04] <maxwell_> im wondering how can i do to fix this autocomplete as im having the same class attribute on each row http://jsfiddle.net/ukHZa/1/
[14:37:08] <grid_> is it possible to load gmail throught an iframe? cause i will not see a page after that, they detect i use an iframe, is there a sideway?
[14:37:19] <grid_> maybe with jquery/ajax
[14:37:40] <systemfault> grid_: There's no way.
[14:37:54] <grid_> systemfault: 100% sure?
[14:38:00] <systemfault> grid_: 98%
[14:38:09] <grid_> did you try it?
[14:38:18] <systemfault> grid_: I don't need to.
[14:38:39] <maxwell_> actually im trying to simulate a clone() behavior on each row
[14:38:44] <systemfault> If google send the HTTP header, you can't do anything.
[14:38:57] <grid_> systemfault: could i open gmail so i make a combination with another page in 1 vieuw?
[14:39:02] <grid_> whatever what method
[14:39:23] <systemfault> Probably not because you'd end up using an iframe.
[14:40:17] <systemfault> maxwell_: I don't know anything about jquery ui, sorry :(
[14:40:45] <maxwell_> oh ok
[14:52:53] <djang0nub> hey guys, i need some help with some jQuery code for web automation. could someone explain why this code doesn't return the userNames array? http://jsfiddle.net/gyWDW/1/
[14:54:09] <dgur> Does anyone have a good example for getting Google maps working with jQuery Mobile?
[15:21:01] <abjorn> god what is going on in my city today
[15:21:11] <abjorn> i decide to go into town to go to torchys tacos
[15:21:17] <abjorn> big mistake, apparently
[15:22:56] <vladikoff> abjorn, o?
[15:23:13] <abjorn> droves and droves of groups on crotch rockets driving like assholes
[15:23:41] <abjorn> also i ran into the "Straight Clownnin Car Club" which I guess is a club for people who like 50 inch rims, escalades, and grand marquis with raised suspensions
[15:23:56] <abjorn> and then like to take those cars and swerve them back and forth in and out of 3 lanes
[15:24:17] <abjorn> with their doors open and legs hanging out
[15:25:36] <b-lew> I'm having some issues with this code. http://pastie.org/7187741 -> I'm not the best so bare with me.
[15:25:41] <b-lew> if you look at this link http://bvh.delineamultimedia.com/?page_id=2 the first 2 images have drop downs when you click them. they both also have galleries but the 2nd image isn't showing the gallery.
[15:25:51] <b-lew> I need to change that code from the id to be more dynamic and I'm unsure how to do that
[15:26:06] <b-lew> I hope that all makes sense. Any help would be amazing.
[15:37:57] <HS^> would the following be possible? i have an ajax call now that gets some html and puts it in a droppable.........
[15:38:17] <HS^> now i want that html to have javascript as well, i want to use jquery buttons etc.
[15:38:29] <HS^> would that work? with the $(document).ready(function ()  call ?
[15:38:45] <HS^> so basicly loading javascript.... through ajax ...
[15:55:21] <spirat> hello. I have a problem with $.ajaxSetup. I register a call to add a request header for POSTs in ajax and it doesn't seem to work. It works when I put it just before the call to $.ajax() but if I do it higher in the page it doesn't work. Any idea why?
[16:03:27] <shoky> spirat: got a link?
[16:11:04] <maxwell_> shoky:  yesterday you helped me out with an autocomplete.. im simulating a cloned div in this fiddle.. so im wondering how to assign values if i have the same class attr http://jsfiddle.net/ukHZa/1/
[16:13:00] <dblosevn> Hey guys, quick question can anybody see what im doing wrong here http://dblosevn.chosd.com/141 Im trying to bind to loadstart and play as well as ended and pause and its not working
[16:18:36] <adac> How do I get the encoding of a text?
[16:26:01] <spirat> shoky: bpase.net/show/87791 that is the code i include
[16:26:24] <dblosevn> never mind it was firing the events
[16:26:32] <spirat> I expect every $.ajax() function in the page that includes this to have the request header if it's a post
[16:27:30] <dblosevn> adac: iconv
[16:28:08] <adac> dblosevn, thanks!
[16:28:28] <dblosevn> np
[16:29:17] <maxwell_> dblosevn:  do you know how can i fix this http://jsfiddle.net/ukHZa/1/ ?
[16:35:12] <shoky> spirat: i can't load that url
[16:35:22] <dblosevn> maxwell_: http://jsfiddle.net/ukHZa/3/ :-)
[16:35:50] <dblosevn> time to find something on tv
[16:35:57] <maxwell_> dblosevn:  the html is still the same?
[16:36:11] <dblosevn> ya i just targeted the fields differently
[16:36:40] <maxwell_> dblosevn:  thanks man
[16:36:43] <dblosevn> np
[16:37:20] <shoky> maxwell_: you need the 2nd div to have the same class
[16:37:24] <shoky> fieldwrapper
[16:37:30] <shoky> for dblosevn's fiddle to work
[16:37:41] <maxwell_> dblosevn:  except that the second row is not working hehe
[16:37:53] <maxwell_> shoky:  ohh there u are
[16:37:57] <maxwell_> excelent
[16:38:00] <maxwell_> will change that
[16:39:27] <dblosevn> oh i never tested the second row muh bad
[16:40:56] <maxwell_> just needed to change the second div name
[16:47:12] <rainb> ís there a XHR listener?
[16:49:24] <coldhead> rainb: http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/
[16:52:44] <rainb> No. I mean like.. something that detects a xhr when is .send(); I guess currently there's nothing like that so the ideal would be to change XMLHttpRequest and replace it with a function that does what I want.
[16:53:19] <CoderFromCincy> you mean an event listener for ajax calls?
[16:53:46] <rainb> Yea.
[16:53:52] <coldhead> i.e. exactly what i linked to?
[16:54:32] <CoderFromCincy> do you have any code I can look at?
[16:54:44] <CoderFromCincy> i
[16:55:03] <CoderFromCincy> i am assuming you are basically picking up how to use ajaxSetup with callbacks
[16:55:35] <yogurt_truck> listen to the coldhead
[16:56:49] <CoderFromCincy> I'm wondering if anyone is familiar with caching issues on IE when using $.ajax with jsonp?
[16:58:30] <coldhead> hand me those goddamn tweezers
[16:59:42] <rainb> No coldhead what I'm looking for is that the event fires, even if I had not sent it, or if I don't know the
[16:59:48] <rainb> XMLHttpRequest object
[17:01:04] <yogurt_truck> o.O
[17:03:51] <coldhead> i wonder what you think i am suggesting then, if not that
[17:04:07] <coldhead> this is all getting very twin peaks, log lady
[17:04:54] <tw2113> *snortles*
[17:04:57] <spirat> shoky: bpaste.net/show/87791 sorry mistyped, i'm switching between OSs on VMs, copy/paste doesnt work
[17:05:08] <tw2113> *pets coldhead's log*
[17:05:08] <spirat> shoky: and thanks too for your time
[17:09:29] <rainb> The thing is that... it just works with jQuery ajax calls not with outside ajax calls
[17:09:41] <rainb> outter*
[17:14:11] <yogurt_truck> rainb: right. so you're trying to inject jQuery into an existing codebase and use it to monitor all global ajax events?
[17:14:27] <rainb> Correct!
[17:17:12] <yogurt_truck> that _does_ sound more likely. that jquery (or the way you're using its API) doesn't handle/interfere with ajax events that haven't been setup through it
[17:17:31] <yogurt_truck> i've never tested it though
[17:18:06] <rainb> So I have to edit XMLHttpRequest constructor, right?
[17:21:46] <yogurt_truck> rainb: I guess so. Put a script before anything else execute, and re-assign XMLHttpRequest with whatever thing you're gonna do (and keep a reference to the original somewhere so you can use it)
[17:23:10] <rainb> Yeah, thought jQuery edited constructors
[17:23:17] <rainb> Anyway thanks a lot
[17:24:47] <shoky> spirat: and the .ajax() call?
[17:27:20] <shoky> spirat: and do you have a console.log in the beforeSend callback to know if it's getting called or not
[17:27:47] <shoky> and if the condition is true
[17:30:24] <spirat> shoky: http://bpaste.net/show/87875/ the call is here
[17:30:50] <spirat> I don't have much log, only a 403 error when the server receives the post without the security token
[17:31:02] <spirat> which should be included if ajaxSetup worked
[17:31:24] <shoky> then start logging
[17:31:44] <shoky> and.. are you sure ajaxSetup is called before the ajax calls?
[17:32:04] <shoky> you were kinda vague about that
[17:32:45] <shoky> async: false   seriously? :\
[17:32:50] <spirat> shoky: the ajax calls are triggered by a mouse click on a button, the ajaxSetup script (my 1st paste) is included right after the <header>. Also I debugged on firebug and ajaxSetup was called when the page loaded
[17:33:08] <spirat> shoky: it's google's sample code for their interface ;)
[17:33:21] <spirat> shoky: I will adapt it, but first I gotta make the basic things work
[17:35:54] <spirat> The funny thing is that the code works only when it's put before the $.ajax() call, If I put it somewhere else it doesn't work. I can't imagine why. I tried other locations as well
[17:36:53] <hateIE> hmmz I just made foundations .row way more acurate by changing it from using px to em
[17:36:59] <shoky> spirat: lemme know how the console.log goes
[17:38:05] <spirat> shoky: the one in the registered function? or just the output in my console?
[17:38:33] <ansikt> spirat:  I'm too lazy to look at your code, but my guess is the reason is that your event is not delegated, but should be.
[17:39:34] <spirat> ansikt: you are talking to a jquery new comer, the click on the button should be delegated?
[17:39:58] <shoky> ansikt: what event?
[17:40:37] <shoky> spirat:  inside the beforeSend callback, inside the if
[17:40:47] <shoky> spirat: right before setting the header
[17:40:49] <spirat> shoky: I don't have anything in the console anyways, just the server's reply for the POST. Everything seems normal.
[17:40:58] <shoky> spirat: get back to me when you do
[17:41:03] <spirat> hmm
[17:42:09] <shoky> spirat: also check the devtools network tab and look at the actual headers sent
[17:42:25] <ansikt> Yeah.  Try jQuery('html').on('click','.buttonSelector',function(){ /*things go here*/});
[17:43:07] <spirat> shoky: I put a breakpoint on the if there, it's never hit. Meaning that ajax never executed the code inside beforeSend
[17:44:56] <shoky> spirat: well, try reproducing the issue.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/pppQu/1/
[17:45:03] <spirat> ansikt: I think it would work, but I would like to use ajaxSetup to make it work for all by ajax queries. The problem is that the setup seems to be ignored except if it's right before the ajax call
[17:45:22] <spirat> shoky: alright. let me see
[17:49:37] <sshaw`> values set via data() are removed when the element is removed, is this expected?
[17:53:15] <shoky> sshaw` yes. tho i'm not entirely sure what you mean
[17:54:13] <sshaw`> shoky: checkout this JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/sshaw/DwDc8
[17:55:25] <sshaw`> I'd think that e.at(0).data('x') would return 123
[17:57:41] <spirat> shoky: I think the code I wrote there works the same way as here (I just made it simpler). However how can I test it? I click the button and nothing appears
[17:58:42] <HardDisk_WP> hey all
[17:59:00] <HardDisk_WP> i'm currently adding an AJAX-based interface to my existing application
[17:59:45] <HardDisk_WP> currently, editing happens via ?action=edit, with form action=submit, which then redirects to ?action=view on success or a ?action=edit which shows the errors
[17:59:47] <shoky> sshaw`: well data is removed so undefined is expected
[18:00:19] <HardDisk_WP> so if I want to do this workflow in AJAX, whats the best practice? submit a JSON object in ?action=submit, and then have ?action=submit return a JSON object?
[18:00:27] <shoky> sshaw` you can .detach() if you want to retain data
[18:00:34] <HardDisk_WP> or should I make ?action=submit a redirect, too, which outputs the JSON object?!
[18:01:18] <shoky> spirat: test it by looking at the actual headers sent with the request, in your browser's devtools network-tab
[18:02:04] <shoky> spirat:  or by looking at the console.log and seeing that beforeSend callback IS called every time
[18:03:33] <aberrant> hi all
[18:04:24] <aberrant> quick noob question: I have a slider that has a "valuesChanging" event - but it creates a TON of requests since it fires on every single slide. Is there a more efficient way of handling this than creating XHRs for each one of these?
[18:05:21] <spirat> shoky: you mean firebug's console? I get nothing
[18:05:47] <shoky> spirat: not even when you push the button?
[18:06:32] <sshaw`> shoky: OK, thanks. Wasn't sure if it was a bug or expected
[18:06:46] <aberrant> I wonder if I can set a callback or something on this.
[18:06:52] <spirat> shoky: I get an error only, line 25 ga.js. Also my changes were not saved... I reloaded the page and lost it. Doing it again..
[18:07:32] <shoky> spirat: i'm talking about my fiddle
[18:08:39] <spirat> shoky: it works indeed
[18:09:09] <shoky> k
[18:16:36] <spirat> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/pppQu/2/ Can you see this? It doesn't work here
[18:17:27] <spirat> the setup is close to mine, except that the ajax() doesn't execute somehow
[18:18:25] <shoky> spirat:  helper is a function, helper.fooBar is undefined
[18:19:14] <shoky> spirat:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/pppQu/3/  works fine
[18:21:27] <spirat> shoky: indeed, strange. I will try to make my code look more like this example and figure out at what point it fails
[18:36:33] <Sab3r> I'm very very new to jquery and still dont fully get how it works. Im doing an interactive map with jqvmap. I was wondering that is it possible to use the tooltip api with the map to give some tooltip of information on mouse hover for example?
[18:48:08] <dblosevn> grr... really jCarousel isnt compatible with jQuery latest ...
[18:52:03] <tw2113> blame the plugin author
[18:53:42] <coco89> hi
[18:53:42] <tw2113> also isn't jQuery latest literally the latest build, not latest stable release
[18:53:59] <coco89> I need to connect my android app to a remote database...
[18:54:09] <coco89> so I need to create an API right?
[18:54:11] <coco89> how do i do this
[18:56:20] <spirat> shoky: got new data: I get the console.log in the beforeSend, but the xhr.setRequestHeader doesn't work at all.
[18:59:17] <coco89> suck a dick everyone.
[19:00:08] <spirat> lol
[19:04:48] <brend_> gotta say beerrpp
[19:10:14] <brend_> every new update in facebook is worst
[19:10:43] <systemfault> Pfff..
[19:11:02] <systemfault> People don't like change… if it's for the best or not doesn't matter
[19:11:45] <brend_> Tru
[19:15:55] <spirat> going off, if someone's got an idea to help me, please /query me. I'm really mad at beforeSend + xfer.setRequestHeader not wanting to work.
[19:16:02] <spirat> thanks @all for your help today
[19:52:06] <ilteris> hello all
[19:57:01] * tw2113 wonders who "all" is
[19:57:02] <tw2113> and why he/she is always said hello to
[20:01:07] <brend_> So I cross my heart and I hope to die..
[20:08:40] <ilteris> hey guys, can I ask for a favor? http://www.smrxt.com/smrxt-intro/intro.html#bookmark if you press Go and then press submit, does the closing animation of the box is jittery for you?
[20:09:24] <ilteris> the first time it looks problematic, but I cannot replicate it on the second time. hitting my head
[20:18:10] <ilteris> so strange
[20:22:12] <ilteris> and this is onlyit's only happening in safari :(
[21:31:30] <aberrant> ?
[22:09:28] <ovnicraft> hello, where i can find the spec events by element, i need implement focus for span but didnt find nothing in doc http://api.jquery.com/focus/
[22:09:28] <ovnicraft> any hint around
[22:41:28] <Reroute> .join #django
[22:41:37] <dblosevn> is there a way to prevent scrolling via a scroll gesture? I am already implementing scrolling the way I want it to via mousedown, mousemove and the scoll gestures are screwing up my logic. eg... when you mousedown mousemove left it scrolls 6 items left but if you use a scroll gesture to scroll it doesnt care where it stops
[22:42:43] <dblosevn> gesture meaning like two finger swipe left
[22:43:11] <dblosevn> or a horizonal scroll wheel if anybody even has thoughs anymore
[22:45:55] <dblosevn> *6 items right
[22:47:56] <bryanbuchanan> Not sure this is what you're looking for, but this will kill the gestures on touch devices: document.body.addEventListener('touchmove', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[22:48:51] <dblosevn> :-( im listening to touchmove
[22:49:00] <bryanbuchanan> doh :/
[22:49:31] <dblosevn> i think its a whole different kind of event when you two finger swipe on a touchpad
[22:49:37] <bryanbuchanan> Didn't read it thoroughly
[22:50:20] <dblosevn> i should have mentioned im listing to touchdown touchmove as well as mousedown mousemove so i can properly support touch devices
[22:50:26] <bryanbuchanan> I want ot say it's treated just like a scroll, just different axis
[22:50:29] <dblosevn> *listening
[22:51:25] <dblosevn> i know when i 2 finger scroll it doesnt fire mousedown or mousemove
[22:54:04] <dblosevn> ah maybe i can use jquery.mousewheel for it :-)
[22:55:03] <dblosevn> because i think the 2 finger scroll sends mousewheel events
[23:22:13] <dblosevn> yep got it :-)
[23:32:59] <mduvall> does anybody know of that html5 animation booklet google released describing how the internet works?
[23:36:16] <diverdude> Im using the jquery ketchup form validation plugin: https://github.com/mustardamus/ketchup-plugin but i cannot figure out how to force hide of validation errors. How can i do that?
[23:38:35] <diverdude> solved
[23:39:30] <dblosevn> $('.ketchup-error').hide() lol
[23:41:06] <diverdude> yep
[23:41:22] <dblosevn> there actually is a proper method to call to do that
[23:42:03] <diverdude> dblosevn, yeah the hideErrorContainer ? i could not make that work
[23:43:12] <dblosevn> $.ketchup.hideErrorContainer($('form'), $('form'), $('.ketchup-error'));
[23:43:21] <dblosevn> looks like it was made to be called internally
[23:43:50] <dblosevn> that should work, not really what its expecting but close enough
[23:45:01] <diverdude> dblosevn, yes it seems so.....do you know if there is a nice way to set a custom error message also? this is my markup:   <input class="span2" id="firstnameTxt" type="text"  data-validate="validate(required,'my custom error msg')"/>
[23:45:13] <diverdude> above dont work
[23:49:09] <diverdude> dblosevn, are you there?
[23:49:17] <dblosevn> reading the docs
[23:49:52] <diverdude> ah, sorry
[23:50:19] <tw2113> how could you dblosevn
[23:50:22] <dblosevn> doesnt appear you can do it that easily, only way I can see to do it is to write your own helpers
[23:50:34] <dblosevn> tw2113: hmm?
[23:50:42] <tw2113> read documentation
[23:50:58] <dblosevn> are you implying that i dont normally?
[23:51:05] <tw2113> sarcasm
[23:51:09] <dblosevn> lol
[23:52:53] <diverdude> dblosevn, hmm yeah :/ thats pretty bad
[23:53:34] <dblosevn> unless you want to override the message of every instance of a certain validation method
[23:53:34] <tw2113> not implying diverdude never did himself, but i wish more people would
[23:53:58] <dblosevn> eg... $.ketchup.message('word', 'Guess the word!');
[23:55:01] <dblosevn> I know sometimes i dont either lol but usually only after working too many hours lol
[23:55:21] <dblosevn> i usually attempt for at least an hour before asking anything in here :-)
[23:55:33] <diverdude> weird how someone can write a complex validation library like that without making it possible to change the error message
[23:55:52] <dblosevn> look above, i showed you how you can change the messages
[23:56:06] <dblosevn> just not on a field by field bases
[23:56:28] <dblosevn> to do it by field youll have to extend the builtin helpers
[23:56:51] <diverdude> dblosevn, yes i even tried that also but it has no effect. eg. $.fn.ketchup.messages = {  'required': 'I only like tomato!'}
[23:56:51] <tw2113> some people don't always think forward like that where others may want to customize parts
[23:57:04] <tw2113> those that do do that, are awesome and worth money
[23:57:06] <dblosevn> required is not a validation type...
[23:57:28] <anirvana> hello folks
[23:57:28] <dblosevn> oh i misread that
[23:57:59] <dblosevn> ya id totally use jquerys validation and call it a day lol
[23:58:02] <diverdude> dblosevn, its not? but there are fields that have the type 'required' if something must be filled into the field
[23:58:15] <anirvana> I have a question about using jquery UI autocomplete remote data srouce
[23:58:19] <anirvana> source*
[23:58:38] <dblosevn> ?ask @ anirvana
[23:58:38] <b-ot> anirvana: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:58:39] <diverdude> dblosevn, but jquery validation dont have those nice speech bobbles
[23:58:40] <anirvana> when I use a remote data source, the autocomplete returns all the results
[23:59:13] <anirvana> it doesn't filter by what I types in the input field and suggest all the values that data source returned
[23:59:13] <dblosevn> anirvana: you have to filter the remote source on the serverside
[23:59:19] <anirvana> oh I see
[23:59:36] <dblosevn> autocomplete will send the filtertext to the server
[23:59:58] <anirvana> should I pass the input field value as a put parameter to the remote source URL?
