[00:00:37] <nisseni> not sure what you mean... it makes a post, afterwords I want the field to be empty
[00:05:06] <PeterPan-> anyone here using handelbar.js?
[00:05:26] <progrock`> nisseni: your code is jsut too much of amess fo rme to read, so asking you whtat you are cually trying to do
[00:05:34] <progrock`> then i can gove youan answer you can implement
[00:05:51] <progrock`> if you clean up the code, an I get what you're doing.. its  2 second thing
[00:06:15] <progrock`> but, probably all you need to know is $('#id_slector').val('')
[00:08:34] <nisseni> progrock`: yeah, it's actually written by cakephp, which isn't that good at this :)
[00:09:14] <progrock`> yeah, no kidding
[00:09:39] <progrock`> anyway, if you want any more of an answer, I need to know exactly what yoyu are tryign to do
[00:11:05] <nisseni> progrock`: will try something now
[00:15:23] <bob_cobb> nisseni: why don't you use shorthand echo tags? <?= ?>
[00:15:46] <nisseni> bob_cobb: isn't that kinda bad practice ?
[00:16:00] <bob_cobb> nisseni: it's personal preference. it makes the code a lot cleaner
[00:16:05] <bob_cobb> i prefer it
[00:16:19] <progrock`> nisseni: 95% of php is bad practice.. get used to it
[00:26:15] <nisseni> I guess
[00:26:33] <nisseni> progrock`: is there a way to unset an input field, instead of just removing the value
[00:27:32] <Eviltwin> Meaning what exactly?
[00:28:09] <Eviltwin> How does the result differ?
[00:29:26] <progrock`> nisseni: a text input?
[00:29:32] <progrock`> nisseni: those are one and the same
[00:29:47] <progrock`> a checkbox is different
[00:30:30] <nisseni> progrock`: ok
[00:30:58] <nisseni> progrock`: the thing is, I have a datepicker, and after I save with ajax it's like the field entries isn't removed
[00:31:04] <sennahoj> anyone here using sammy.js?
[00:31:31] <nisseni> progrock`: the datepicker allows only today an on fourth
[00:31:39] <nisseni> and I have to and from dates
[00:32:08] <nisseni> so when saved the to date isn't changeable until I've changed the from date, you understand?
[00:32:30] <progrock`> no
[00:33:23] <nisseni> I have two datepickers, one from and one to...
[00:33:41] <nisseni> when selecting from, I can only select "to" in the future of "from"
[00:33:41] <progrock`> ok
[00:33:46] <nisseni> and that works fine
[00:33:57] <progrock`> ok
[00:34:04] <nisseni> but as I save with ajax, it's like the input fields aren't emptied
[00:34:15] <progrock`> yeah, of couse they arent emptied
[00:34:30] <hugli> Is there a way to convert JSON to GET string? Thank yuo
[00:34:31] <progrock`> what are these datepicker inputs>
[00:34:34] <progrock`> HTMl... jquery ui?
[00:34:37] <nisseni> progrock`: exactly
[00:34:37] <progrock`> HTML5*
[00:34:43] <nisseni> jquery ui
[00:35:00] <progrock`> hugli: jsut pass the json as data usiing jquerys ajax/get methods
[00:35:20] <progrock`> nisseni: and are you looking at the jqueryui docs?
[00:35:22] <Eviltwin> hugli: Look at JSON.parse and $.param
[00:35:39] <nisseni> progrock`: not sure what to look for...
[00:36:04] <progrock`> nisseni: you;re trying to reset the values>
[00:36:19] <nisseni> progrock`: ah, ok
[00:36:26] <subdesign> hi
[00:36:46] <hugli> progrock`: I need to assign it straight to window.location.hreh
[00:37:03] <progrock`>  hugli why?
[00:37:23] <progrock`> hugli: JSON.stringify() is likey wahat you want..
[00:37:47] <hugli> I want to force download instead of following a link
[00:38:14] <subdesign> hey, I want to fade in a message on my page, but effects doesn't work. why? http://pastie.org/3280970
[00:38:28] <progrock`> o.. mm i think jquery has a built in method for that hugli
[00:38:50] <progrock`> its gotta e pretty straight forward object..
[00:39:19] <progrock`> hugli: either param or serialize.. yoll have to look which
[00:39:40] <Hooloovoork> hugli: you want it to download something instead of trying to render it in the browser?
[00:39:50] <progrock`> oh god... livequery...
[00:40:30] <progrock`> subdesign: why are you (Ab)using live query?
[00:40:52] <subdesign> progrock`, it works for me lot of cases
[00:40:57] <subdesign> what do you suggest ?
[00:41:12] <subdesign> im open minded
[00:41:18] <progrock`> subdesign: umm, a simple approach instea dof using a plugin to be lazy and not understand whas going on
[00:41:21] <progrock`> jsut a guess there
[00:41:42] <Hooloovoork> what's live query?
[00:41:58] <progrock`> when are these notification added?
[00:42:09] <subdesign> php error appears
[00:42:20] <progrock`>  ajax, page laod.. etc
[00:42:28] <subdesign> page load
[00:42:48] <progrock`> ok. so just in the $(document).ready(function() ...
[00:42:54] <progrock`> fade in the notifications
[00:43:12] <subdesign> hm
[00:44:46] <progrock`> hel, if you include youre js at the end, you dont even need the docment read.. but not a bad idea
[00:44:57] <progrock`> m ywhoel point is, you dont need livequery, so why abuse using it
[00:45:53] <progrock`> my coworker just raped the performance on our platform for a few days by using live('hover' ...
[00:46:17] <subdesign> ok trying without lq
[00:46:22] <progrock`> luckily that was jsut about 1.7 with the much much beter at delegating $.on()  came out
[00:47:37] <systemfault> progrock`: lol
[00:49:34] <kakeman> cool
[00:56:33] <kakeman> i have thing like this: return HttpResponse(json.dumps({'event_number' : contacts_event_number}))
[00:57:58] <kakeman> so how can i read that event_number from response data?
[00:58:51] <kakeman> data.event_number?
[00:59:05] <progrock`> subdesign: this is how I usually do a fade in http://jsfiddle.net/bSbsJ/2/
[00:59:22] <hazamonzo> hey folks. i have a ul with items that i attach a click function to. Im just thinking... what would be the best way to identify these li's for the click function. i was thinking of adding a class with the name of the file so that i could use jquery to get the class name and then use it to create the click() functions redirect url
[00:59:25] <progrock`> subdesign: just pass in any collectin in the orderyou wat to fade in
[00:59:29] <hazamonzo> but this sounds a little hackish
[00:59:51] <progrock`> hazamonzo: class/id on the ul
[01:00:05] <hazamonzo> progrock`: So it isn't a nasty solution then?
[01:00:10] <progrock`> huh?
[01:00:33] <progrock`> wait, you want to add the filename sa a class
[01:00:35] <progrock`> thats ugly
[01:00:52] <hazamonzo> progrock`: exactly!
[01:01:05] <progrock`> hazamonzo: wl your wodign of that shit was ugly
[01:01:07] <systemfault> hazamonzo: Create a custom attribute
[01:01:14] <progrock`> use data, or jsut normal links
[01:01:30] <subdesign> progrock`, thx woring, i just left to set display:none
[01:01:31] <progrock`> yeah.. data-url  ... or smething..
[01:01:58] <hazamonzo> progrock`: that sounds like a betetr solution
[01:02:07] <progrock`> hazamonzo: lol, I'd hope so
[01:02:22] <hazamonzo> i mean... i have the url in the json result i want to attach to the click function... just not sure where i was going to put it
[01:02:25] <progrock`> I hope click is doing more than following a link...
[01:02:50] <hazamonzo> progrock`: well the ul list is actually a carousel of sorts...
[01:03:19] <progrock`> what I'm getting at is.. if all the click is doing is loading a URL.. just use a normal link
[01:03:28] <hazamonzo> i "could" attach the click (or a simple href) to the in focus item but...
[01:03:36] <Eviltwin> UL list is redundant
[01:03:42] <shellox> hi
[01:03:50] <hazamonzo> Eviltwin: oh? :)
[01:03:51] <Eviltwin> The UL stands for unordered list
[01:03:57] <hazamonzo> Eviltwin: indeed
[01:05:34] <progrock`> hazamonzo: or again you coud jsut wrap the item with a link in thr HTML and not use JS
[01:06:01] <hazamonzo> progrock`: this is also true
[01:06:30] <hugli> Hooloovoork progrock` Eviltwin : Thanks for help $.param worked for me.
[01:07:07] <hazamonzo> custom attributes look pretty interesting. Could come in useful
[01:07:16] <Eviltwin> Also see ?.data
[01:07:17] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[01:07:20] <progrock`> damn it, I must have fucekd up my permissions.. fuckign nginx not found when I know I put everythign i nthe right place
[01:07:30] <Eviltwin> Especially the section on http://api.jquery.com/data/#data-html5
[01:07:43] <shellox> https://gist.github.com/6b9c93fc3f7ef76ab813
[01:07:55] <shellox> i wonder why it works in firefox but not in chromium
[01:09:17] <dunkel2> hi there
[01:09:25] <dunkel2> is it possible to stop a video using jquery?
[01:10:05] <progrock`> shellox: if youre using jquer.. why wuld you sue document.upload ?
[01:10:14] <hazamonzo> Eviltwin: oh thats very cool!
[01:10:16] <hazamonzo> I like that
[01:11:30] <progrock`> ugh I hate gists that dont work with bl.ocks.org
[01:11:57] <progrock`> I guess they dont like the full <html>... only likes the shit inside of the body
[01:12:23] <progrock`> shellox: but yeah, document.upload  is not the universal way of sleecting that..
[01:12:38] <progrock`> $(this) . ...
[01:13:03] <progrock`> thats if change works on the fom itself, which I htink jquery did unify that funcitonalt
[01:13:20] <shellox> progrock`: how would you solve it?
[01:13:38] <shellox> the problem is that POST is empty if i use chromium but it works with firefox for me
[01:13:42] <progrock`> oh, I lied abotu the html an body shit, I wonder what was effing up bl.ocks.org
[01:13:52] <progrock`> shellox: I alread ytold you
[01:14:10] <progrock`> replace document.upload  with $(this)
[01:16:44] <shellox> progrock`: ok thanks, but chromium still have this issue
[01:17:04] <progrock`> shellox: well please post on jsfiddle or somewhere I can edit
[01:17:43] <progrock`> man, did I mention, I am living this vi mode on zsh
[01:17:59] <progrock`> now all I need to do is cod esomehting similar for irssi
[01:18:45] <progrock`> shellox: and what is chrome fucking up.. if it submits.. it should be alright
[01:19:40] <shellox> progrock`: it submits, but the post data are empty in chromium
[01:19:59] <shellox> but the same thing works with another browser well, so I'm not sure whats the real problem
[01:20:14] <shellox> http://jsfiddle.net/xPWGR/
[01:22:26] <shellox> mhh works with konqueror too
[01:22:49] <shellox> Maybe my chromium installation is broken, i will try to recompile it..
[01:24:14] <progrock`> shellox: did yu cheack the headers sent?
[01:25:08] <shellox> no, i haven't yet
[01:25:32] <dunkel2> can i stop an html5 video with jquery?
[01:25:49] <progrock`> dunkel2: I dont think you need jquery to do that,m jsut straight js
[01:26:13] <dunkel2> mm i didnt find howâ€¦ ill keep searching
[01:26:14] <dunkel2> thank you
[01:27:31] <progrock`> shellox: my chromium is sneding the file
[01:27:42] <progrock`> wel, I switch document.uploda   to $(this)
[01:28:02] <progrock`> http://jsfiddle.net/xPWGR/1/
[01:28:13] <progrock`> Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="boxstyles.html"
[01:28:21] <progrock`> thats was sent in my payload
[01:28:26] <progrock`> which si the file i chose
[01:30:33] <progrock`> so yeah, it should work
[01:35:43] <dannyd> hiii
[01:35:50] <dannyd> why is this wrong: if ($('#orderLittraText').attr(placeholder) !== 'Littra: ')
[01:36:07] <progrock`> 'placeholder'
[01:36:24] <dannyd> i want, that check if that attribute is equal the string 'Littra: ' ...
[01:36:30] <dannyd> ahaa
[01:36:35] <dannyd> :-)
[01:36:39] <dannyd> thanks!
[01:51:55] <sendoushi> so... http://pastebin.com/JzGNVwCB this gives me an alert undefined... why? why doesn't this work? i'm trying to know which was pressed so i can give to it a class named "active" and to the others find out if they have a class named active and if it so... get it out. the problem is finding which one was clicked

[01:56:07] <Myx0x3> why does this not work? http://jsfiddle.net/Aad3G/
[02:00:22] <nFFF> Myx0x3 you nneed to include the jQuery frameowrk to begin
[02:01:01] <Myx0x3> true, but ive got that code on my site
[02:01:13] <Myx0x3> but i think this solves my problem: $('.foliobtn',this).hide(); http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1931352/jquery-show-hide-by-class-when-multiple-items-contain-the-said-class
[02:02:08] <nFFF> yes I don't think you can do $(this+'.anotherclass')
[02:02:21] <nFFF> apart from that selector the code is fine
[02:03:09] <Ortund> Myx0x3, your identifier for the .more is wrong -> http://jsfiddle.net/LYoung/Aad3G/2/
[02:04:56] <camslice> hey folks, can anyone shed some light on how i can create a javascrtip function that contains jquery, then call it on first run, then call it again when the user clicks? here's my code: http://hastebin.com/tofexaxoxi.xml
[02:13:14] <Ortund> camslice: try this: http://hastebin.com/hafeveyiha.coffee
[02:16:13] <camslice> Ortund: ok thanks. so the code is fine, i just need to call that function after the page has loaded yea?
[02:17:02] <palanivel> hi hi
[02:17:05] <palanivel> how to highlight after clicking the link items
[02:17:11] <palanivel> can any 1 help me
[02:17:36] <Ortund> camslice, I didn't look at the code for the function, just how to execute it when the page loads, but yeah, putting it just like that should do
[02:17:39] <kwk> Hi. I was wondering if jquery.jqGrid-4.3.1 can work with jquery-1.4.2.min.js ?
[02:18:02] <Ortund> palanivel got an example of what you're looking for?
[02:20:23] <palanivel> when am click 1 of the list item that link ill be highlighted thats means font ill be bold
[02:22:05] <camslice> Ortund: cheers :)
[02:22:31] <kd`>  /w 11
[02:23:33] <andalusia> using jquery, if i use toggleClass to change the class of a div, can i not then use another jquery function to find any div with the new class?
[02:23:34] <camslice> win 3
[02:23:40] <andalusia> does it not physically alter the code?
[02:24:08] <Ortund> camslice, it worked?
[02:24:26] <camslice> Ortund: yup. nice one
[02:24:30] <Ortund> sweet
[02:25:14] <Ortund> andalusia, you could use .find() but that'll only work if your jquery is triggered from a parent of the object you're looking for
[02:26:26] <andalusia> so the div i'm trying to change would have to be a child of what i'm clicking?
[02:26:35] <andalusia> i'm sorry if i don't understand, i'm quite new to jquery
[02:28:26] <Ortund> andalusia, yes
[02:29:35] <andalusia> this is what i'm trying to do.. http://jsfiddle.net/xLMYK/
[02:30:07] <andalusia> so for example, #stone1234 would be current
[02:30:21] <stevefrost> Does anyone have any experience of hacking jquery validate to play nicely with uniform?
[02:30:29] <andalusia> and that code finds '.current' and executes that code
[02:30:42] <toxz> is there a simply way to get all params from a form to use them for $.post ?
[02:31:02] <andalusia> but then when i try another link that finds .current, it doesn't work
[02:31:21] <andalusia> it just finds the original div that was 'current' which leads me to believe it doesn't actually change the code
[02:32:05] <Ortund> palanivel: http://jsfiddle.net/LYoung/s3ezw/
[02:32:53] <DireFog> how do I run a selector over a set of elements? Say, somefunc(sel) { /* now I want all elements in sel with a certain selector */ }($('#hello');
[02:33:04] <DireFog> .find doesn't work since it matches only descendants
[02:33:18] <DireFog> but I want to refine the passed-in collection
[02:34:10] <nisseni> anyone knows how to reset the datepicker?
[02:34:35] <Cork> DireFog: you mean .filter ?
[02:34:38] <Cork> ?.filter
[02:34:39] <bot-t1> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[02:34:57] <DireFog> Cork: exactly, thanks :-)
[02:35:34] <DireFog> should be on the selectors page in the docs
[02:35:52] <toxz> but you dont select with it
[02:36:04] <toxz> is there a simple way to get all params from a form to use them for $.post ? like " $('form').buildPostVars() " :-)
[02:37:01] <Ortund> palanivel: here's a modified version that resets all other items to normal font weight -> http://jsfiddle.net/LYoung/s3ezw/
[02:37:02] <Cork> ?.serialize @ toxz
[02:37:03] <bot-t1> toxz, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[02:37:25] <Cork> toxz: or if you want to modify them first see ?.serializeArray
[02:37:26] <bot-t1> toxz, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[02:37:57] <arvind_khadri> Hi, is there a way I can know when jquery is loaded on to the page?
[02:38:06] <toxz> a yes - i knew there was something like this
[02:38:15] <toxz> thx
[02:38:29] <Cork> arvind_khadri: if you put jquery in the header its loaded when the next tag is run
[02:38:54] <Cork> arvind_khadri: if you load it in body, not really
[02:39:18] <Cork> arvind_khadri: and if you use another framework to load it like requirejs, then it has a callback
[02:39:56] <amit_usual> how can i set up a workflow using jquery where i show few urls inside a popup
[02:40:15] <palanivel> @ortund: thankzz a lot
[02:40:21] <arvind_khadri> Cork, oh ok. I am appending it in the body.  Does the same apply for jquery-ui?
[02:40:32] <Cork> arvind_khadri: yes
[02:40:39] <Cork> scripts added in the body is loaded async
[02:40:45] <Cork> so no garantee in any form
[02:41:12] <arvind_khadri> Cork, I see.  Thanks :)
[02:41:25] <Cork> arvind_khadri: np
[02:41:48] <Cork> amit_usual: you need to give more info then that
[02:42:20] <Cork> amit_usual: where does the url come from, what should show it, its relation and things like that
[02:42:27] <amit_usual> Cork : so i am making a small site using django as server side scripting
[02:43:07] <amit_usual> I want the accepting terms and then giving verification code workflow through  a popup
[02:43:38] <amit_usual> so can I do a http redirect inside a popup window and if yes how to close this popup
[02:43:58] <Cork> by popup do you mean a separat browser window
[02:44:16] <Cork> or are you talking about a html window (like jquery-ui dialog)
[02:44:22] <amit_usual> yes and slightly smaller one at that
[02:44:52] <andalusia> can someone help me here, can you see at http://thegage.co.uk/gocreative/testing.html if you click on 'words' on the left nav then it will fade out the stones and fade in the new stones, and the same if you then click on 'images', but if you do that in a different order then it messes up. what i want is for it to be dynamic and figure out when some stones are showing, and hide them before it shows the new stones
[02:44:55] <andalusia> how would i go about that?
[02:45:23] <amit_usual> Cork : i don't want a ui dialog because  i need certain forms to be filled up
[02:45:51] <Cork> amit_usual: i didn't state what you need to use; but you do need to specify what your doing
[02:46:17] <Cork> your question right now is making me grasp at straws
[02:46:26] <amit_usual> ok
[02:46:54] <amit_usual> so basically i wish a certain part of the user login workflow inside a pop up
[02:47:28] <QiBala> /join #rteenagers
[02:47:36] <QiBala> hm
[02:47:39] <nisseni> opsi
[02:47:56] <amit_usual> this is basically Accepting the terms and then on next url giving me back the verification code
[02:48:09] <amit_usual> so how do i go about handling this
[02:48:20] <Cork> amit_usual: you still need to specify what the a "popup" means in your structure
[02:50:13] <amit_usual> well anything that allows me to show some html  and forms but not on the parent window but on a smaller child window
[02:51:12] <andalusia> can anybody help me with my issue above? ^^^
[02:51:16] <Cork> amit_usual: well that leavs an iframe or a new browser window
[02:51:36] <Cork> amit_usual: both will bring quite a bit of problems in compatibility
[02:51:55] <fatman> Hi everybody
[02:52:06] <Cork> amit_usual: ex. if you use a browser window, you need to do it from a user clicking something on the page
[02:52:20] <Cork> amit_usual: if you don't the window will be blocked
[02:52:35] <Cork> amit_usual: and iframe has layering problems in the page
[02:52:56] <Cork> and give load delays
[02:53:02] <fatman> I need to diplay two or more datepickers in the same time on the same page, does anyone knows how to do this?
[02:54:38] <Ortund> andalusia, try something like this -> http://jsfiddle.net/LYoung/xLMYK/1/
[02:56:40] <nisseni> I have a from and to date using datepicker, from can't be later than to - I'm saving that form with ajax, so the page doesn't reload. This, however, results in that the "from" field isn't resetted. The result of this is that the to date can't be a date after the one I selected when saving the first time, I've tried clearing the input field, but this doesn't do the trick
[02:56:58] <Ortund> andalusia, this revision makes it clearer what's going on -> http://jsfiddle.net/LYoung/xLMYK/2/
[02:58:06] <Ortund> nisseni, have you tried $(document).ready(function() { preventDefault(); }); by any chance?
[02:58:11] <BrixSAt> Hello, can i put a  checkbox in a jquery dialog (like a disable next popups)
[02:58:24] <AdvoWork> any reason why realData = JSON.parse(data); would work with chrome, but not firefox?
[02:58:58] <nisseni> Ortund: nope... on the date picker or on the click function?
[02:59:10] <beasty> anyone using jquery.fileupload.js ?
[02:59:21] <beasty> cause it works in every browser excepts opera
[02:59:40] <fatman> I need to diplay two or more datepickers in the same time on the same page, does anyone knows how to do this?
[03:00:16] <nisseni> fatman: give the inputs a unique id?
[03:00:29] <andalusia> ortund: thank you, sorry i was fixing an issue with a colleagues computer, i'll have a look
[03:00:32] <Ortund> nisseni, just copy $(document).ready(function() { preventDefault(); }); into your <script> block. It stops the default values being loaded on callback (far as I know)
[03:00:39] <fatman> I mean, in the SAME TIME, as in two calendars visible
[03:01:21] <fatman> it ha something to do with the calendar div, but i have no idea how to fiddle with it
[03:02:01] <nisseni> Ortund: 	preventDefault is not defined
[03:02:23] <nisseni> fatman: not sure what you are trying to do?
[03:02:34] <Cork> nisseni: function(event) { event.preventDefault() }
[03:03:14] <fatman> foe example; i have two inputs and I want them BOTH to show their calendars at once
[03:03:15] <Ortund> haha my bad nisseni... normally I just use jquery for ui manipulation
[03:05:13] <nisseni> Cork: I'm really bad with jquery - should it still be in document.ready? and the event, should that be replaced with something?
[03:06:23] <sgronblo> Can't jquery add the basic authentication string for if I do a jsonp request?
[03:09:02] <fatman> Is it possible to display TWO datepicker calendars in the SAME time on the same page (assuming there are already two inputs with diff IDs, yadayada, I am talking about simultaneous diplay here)
[03:09:40] <nisseni> fatman: I think that's what I'm doing at least
[03:09:55] <fatman> how are you doing it?
[03:10:35] <nisseni> fatman: as I understand it, you just have to add the datepicker function, then all inputs with the class datepicker uses that function... Or am I misunderstanding you here?
[03:12:21] <fatman> nisseni: the datepicker function is called correctly, but the calendar DIV is actually shared between inputs, therefore when I call ....datepicker("show") on one, it dissapears from the other; I want to have two calendars in the same time
[03:14:05] <nisseni> ah, then I understand
[03:15:13] <nisseni> maybe a foreach loop
[03:15:25] <andalusia> Ortund: in the code you gave me, what purpose does the 'div' have in '$(".stones div")' ?
[03:19:45] <nisseni> Ortund: so what's the final answer?
[03:19:47] <nisseni> :)
[03:20:42] <Ortund> andalusia, that selects the div, not .stones
[03:21:00] <andalusia> do you mean the child divs?
[03:21:08] <Ortund> to be more specific, it selects each child div in .stones
[03:21:28] <andalusia> ok i thought as much
[03:21:30] <Ortund> that's just there so that if you click on one, all others that are visible get hidden
[03:21:40] <andalusia> right i see
[03:21:51] <andalusia> well it's not working as of yet, i'm not sure if that's just user error though
[03:24:59] <Ortund> are you using Chrome, andalusia?
[03:25:45] <andalusia> no, safari
[03:25:52] <Ortund> ouch
[03:26:04] <Ortund> does it have something like firebug that'll tell you what errors you get?
[03:26:40] <andalusia> no but i can throw it into firefox
[03:26:49] <andalusia> i do have chrome if you'd prefer i used that?
[03:28:29] <Jonno_FTW> hello, I am using this plugin http://tablesorter.com/docs/ and want to specify my own texExtraction option but, I can't get it to properly sort on checkbox elements, http://pastebin.ws/nk0b4
[03:30:06] <nisseni> andalusia: did you w3c validate it?
[03:30:11] <nisseni> might be something simple like that
[03:31:13] <bjensen> how would you guys disable the submit button after a submit? I have this: http://pastie.org/3281624 but it doesn't work in IE
[03:31:30] <bjensen> it doesn't send the values of any of the inputs
[03:33:21] <andalusia> the jquery isn't being executed when i click
[03:33:27] <andalusia> for some unknown reason
[03:33:39] <andalusia> the validator just tells me about character encoding issues
[03:34:10] <bjensen> referring to my code?
[03:34:27] <andalusia> no, sorry, my code
[03:34:33] <andalusia> i have an issue too P
[03:34:34] <andalusia> *:P
[03:35:58] <Ortund> andalusia, throw it into jsfiddle or something so I can see
[03:36:21] <andalusia> i've uploaded it to the site, would it be easier for you to see it like that? as it includes images
[03:38:32] <dannyd> hi..
[03:38:48] <andalusia> Ortund: http://thegage.co.uk/gocreative/testing.html
[03:38:55] <dannyd> is the a way to make the <li> element be multirow??
[03:50:23] <is_null> hi all, when the user clicks on an element (A) it shows another element (B). Question: how to detect that the user clicks outside element (B) to hide it ? like in gmail search, click to show advanced options, then click elsewhere in the page: it closes advanced options
[03:50:57] <faryshta> is_null, $("body").click();
[03:51:56] <is_null> faryshta: won't that be triggered even if the click is on (B) ?
[03:52:16] <is_null> maybe $('body:not(#B)').click, thanks
[03:53:16] <faryshta> is_null, that won't work. your query ask for a body tag not named #B
[03:53:21] <Polynomial> I'm getting a problem when using getJSON - the URL it hits is the correct path, but instead of the filename I supplied it uses %5Bobject%20Object%5D
[03:53:30] <Polynomial> so http://localhost/path/%5Bobject%20Object%5D
[03:54:06] <faryshta> What you need is to put a lock on $("#B").click();
[03:54:07] <is_null> faryshta: right, even body :not(#B) doesn't work
[03:54:31] <faryshta> is_null, put a lock on $(#B).click.
[03:54:37] <is_null> isn't it possible to know what element was clicked from the click event?
[03:54:48] <is_null> "put a lock" ?
[03:55:14] <faryshta> is_null, no, it just trigger each event for every element clicked which can be as many as you declare.
[03:55:17] <Polynomial> here's the paste: http://pastebin.com/JAkBRmAH
[03:55:28] <_ramo> hi
[03:55:39] <Polynomial> neither the success or error function gets called
[03:55:47] <faryshta> is_null, something like this: $(#b).click( function () {lock=1});
[03:55:47] <_ramo> is there a plugin where i have a multi checkbox interface ?
[03:56:17] <faryshta> $("body").click( function (){if(!lock){}});
[03:56:46] <Polynomial> wat.
[03:57:01] <Polynomial> if I change it to a standard .ajax, it works
[03:57:56] <faryshta> _ramo, i don't understand your question.
[03:58:40] <is_null> faryshta: thanks, i implemented something inspired by your idea
[03:58:48] <faryshta> is_null, no prob.
[03:59:23] <is_null> ftr: http://dpaste.com/695102/ (using e.stopPropagation())
[04:00:19] <_ramo> faryshta: something like that: https://static-ssl-cdn.addons.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/27/27589.png?modified=1227796481
[04:01:09] <_ramo> faryshta: and i want to submit all check checkboxes
[04:01:10] <faryshta> _ramo, no idea, sorry.
[04:01:36] <faryshta> _ramo, to submit all checked box I can help.
[04:02:00] <faryshta> $("input:checked").each(function (){});

[04:11:21] <Lichurec> Hi There ;)
[04:13:35] <choppari> hi
[04:13:43] <choppari> hi
[04:15:31] <Lichurec> Does anyone know a workaround to make $.isPlainObject() return a proper value while testing event objects in IE?
[04:26:49] <andalusia> Ortund: thank you for your help :)
[04:38:44] <AdvoWork> Hi, If I'm doing: $("#somediv").load('test.php).dialog({ resizable: true, width:700, height:900,.... im trying to make the width/height reflect A4 paper size (210x297) any ideas please?
[04:39:14] <Lichurec> AdvoWork: reflect on what?
[04:39:26] <trevor_> a4  paper size :P
[04:40:00] <Lichurec> in css - you can use mm if you want, but can't promise jQ.dialog() accepts such values
[04:43:48] <Lichurec> AdvoWork: wellâ€¦ should, if you do {width: '210mm', height: '297mm'} but that's (logically) pointlessâ€¦
[04:45:08] <faryshta> AdvoWork, multiply each side times 4?
[04:45:08] <cerales> Can anyone give me a clue why an AJAX response with status 200 and well formed responseText is being passed to the error callback in a $.ajax() call, not to the success callback?
[04:46:09] <faryshta> cerales, on chrome you can read the error message (if any) using the debug system and choosing the network tab.
[04:47:04] <cerales> faryshta: it doesn't seem to be an error message there: there's a network request with 200 ok
[04:47:10] <cerales> and no errors reported on the console.
[04:49:43] <faryshta> cerales, can you past your code on pastebin¡
[04:49:47] <faryshta> ??
[04:51:02] <cerales> faryshta: http://pastebin.com/RuEZdKWF
[04:51:14] <cerales> the error function is getting called, but from the network tab the request looks fine..
[04:51:43] <cerales> faryshta: also i know 'data' and 'err' aren't the args to success(), that was to tdebug
[04:51:55] <AdvoWork> faryshta, what dio you mean?
[04:52:04] <AdvoWork> and Lichurec whypointless?
[04:54:29] <cerales> i just can't imagine why error() gets called on $.ajax when he status is 200 and the body is fine.
[04:55:08] <cerales> the error getting passed to error() seems to just be a response object!
[04:58:11] <Lichurec> AdvoWork: wellâ€¦ if you actually want the popup to always be the size of a paper you have no other way than to use absolute units like mm, cm or in (assuming that the rendering engine will properly calculate the value) http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#absolute-lengths
[04:58:34] <AdvoWork> Lichurec, ahh ok, well its going to be a printout/report that will be A4, so im trying to make it look the same or similar
[04:58:46] <Lichurec> anything else will depend on the output-device resolutionsâ€¦
[05:10:54] <guy> https://gist.github.com/e23e91b74d9247192d45
[05:11:10] <guy> why is the console.log() still triggered after dashboard.on('focus', 'div.column textarea', function(e){
[05:13:10] <Cork> guy: stopPropagation dosen't end the event function
[05:13:25] <Cork> guy: it just means "don't propagate it up the tree"
[05:13:50] <guy> Well, then what's the solution?
[05:13:57] <Cork> return;
[05:14:12] <Cork> that will stop the functions execution
[05:14:14] <guy> Cork: ...
[05:14:36] <guy> how much time did you spend actually looking at that code, Cork?
[05:15:05] <Cork> guy: not really sure what you mean?
[05:15:08] <guy> I simply want to bind event inside another event. stopPropagation by definition should prevent the new event from being triggered.
[05:15:15] <beasty> afternoon all
[05:15:17] <Cork> no
[05:15:28] <Cork> it prevets the focus event from propagating
[05:15:31] <Cork> it does nothing for click
[05:15:34] <beasty> hmm is there a way to upgrade from 1.4.x to 1.7.x ?
[05:15:55] <Cork> beasty: replace the jquery file and fix all the code that breaks
[05:15:59] <guy> Cork: oh right. That explains the behaviour. But then how do I stop 'click' from being propogated?
[05:16:18] <Cork> guy: bind click and stop its propagation
[05:16:39] <Cork> or check the event.target
[05:16:40] <guy> How do I find the click event... ? Because that' what I am doing now.
[05:16:43] <Cork> (in the click event)
[05:17:07] <beasty> ok
[05:17:16] <beasty> Cork: and browser compat ?
[05:17:21] <guy> I am trying to bind the click event; inside the focus event (after the latter is triggered, ie) https://gist.github.com/e23e91b74d9247192d45
[05:17:35] <Cork> guy: dashboard.on('click', 'div.column textarea', function(event) { event.stopRpopagation(); });
[05:18:00] <Cork> *stopPropagation()
[05:32:20] <mikunos> hi guys how have I to select the first list of "a href" in my ul list? I would like to delete the link. http://jsfiddle.net/gPmb3/
[05:32:59] <guy> ....... lol.. wtf totally lost.
[05:33:23] <mikunos> guy are u talking with me?
[05:34:35] <guy> No, Cork. https://gist.github.com/7aab6ab7e1d7267307e6
[05:34:43] <guy> See comments, please.
[05:35:10] <Cork> guy: you never stop the propagation
[05:35:37] <Cork> ?g javascript event bubbeling
[05:35:47] <guy> I don't .. because there is no point to stop 'focus' propagation, when the issue is 'click' event.
[05:36:07] <Cork> guy: you need to run it in the click event
[05:36:23] <Cork> right now you bind an event and does nothing at all
[05:36:28] <Cork> *and do
[05:37:06] <guy> that's only scheme. I need both bindings, but the second is supposed to be set only after the first one is triggered.
[05:37:32] <Cork> ok?
[05:40:14] <mikunos> any help with my little script? http://jsfiddle.net/gPmb3/
[05:41:11] <guy> https://gist.github.com/a8e6c39dbd46531c2cd0
[05:41:17] <guy> anyone to help me with this question>
[05:42:34] <Cork> guy: you need to bind an event on the text areas, that stop the click even
[05:42:35] <Cork> +t
[05:42:52] <Cork> it has nothing to do with the focus event, its two different event types
[05:42:57] <guy> oh... I think I got it.
[05:43:36] <guy> https://gist.github.com/eef1a5a5fadebffc468e
[05:43:39] <Cork> mikunos: if you need help you need to ask your question
[05:43:53] <mikunos> how have I to select the first list of "a href" in my ul list? I would like to delete the link. http://jsfiddle.net/gPmb3/
[05:43:58] <guy> here we go. Sorry, I didn't quite understood the logic the first time you said it.
[05:45:27] <Cork> mikunos: you mean you want to remove the link in the last column of the first line
[05:45:34] <Cork> or the last column of every line?
[05:45:38] <Cork> or... what?
[05:45:54] <mikunos> I would like to delete the href in the first level only
[05:46:29] <Cork> so $('#sublist_domains tbody td:last a').remove()
[05:46:46] <mikunos> no Cork
[05:48:34] <mikunos> I have to delete only the href value in the first items
[05:48:47] <mikunos> dashboard, customers, support
[05:48:50] <mikunos> etc...
[05:49:16] <Cork> customers support?
[05:49:20] <mikunos> the nested links must be not edited
[05:49:25] <Cork> uh.. are you looking on the same table?
[05:49:42] <mikunos> it is not a table
[05:49:48] <mikunos> it is a list
[05:50:05] <Cork> uh... "<table border="0" cellpadding="5" class="tablesorter" id="sublist_domains">"
[05:50:07] <Cork> its a table
[05:50:28] <mikunos> no you don't see what I see
[05:50:32] <mikunos> a moment
[05:50:39] <Cork> parrently -_-'
[05:50:46] <mikunos> http://jsfiddle.net/gPmb3/37/
[05:50:58] <mikunos> can u see it now?
[05:51:15] <Cork> i'll tell you when jsfiddle loads :)
[05:51:32] <Cork> heh thats something different :)
[05:51:37] <mikunos> :D
[05:51:40] <mikunos> yes it is
[05:52:32] <Cork> so you mant to remove the hrefs for the .item links?
[05:53:05] <Cork> or where is the separation of what you don't want to fiddle with
[05:53:27] <mikunos>  .item links just for the first level
[05:53:38] <mikunos> dashboard, customers, support ...
[05:53:47] <mikunos> not the nested links
[05:54:08] <Cork> uh. btw <ul> <ul> isn't valid
[05:54:19] <Cork> you need an <li> or <ol> in there
[05:54:47] <mazzachre> Is is normal that I can't use jqueryui fully in jsfiddle? I have made a small widget with a dialog, but when I run it in jsfiddle, I can't get the dialog working...
[05:54:54] <mikunos> ok
[05:54:56] <Cork> anyway $('ul.topnav > li > ul.subnav > li.item a').removeAttr('href')
[05:55:06] <Cork> that should remove those hrefs
[05:55:32] <mikunos> $('ul.topnav > li > ul.subnav > li.item a').removeAttr('href') doesn't remove the liks
[05:55:33] <mikunos> links
[05:55:53] <Cork> not in its current form, as its written with the fixed li problem
[05:56:02] <mikunos> oh ok
[05:56:22] <Cork> some browsers will actually move the second ul out of the parent
[05:56:32] <Cork> so you can't actaully count on it beeing the parent
[05:56:40] <Cork> (until you fix that error)
[05:56:42] <mazzachre> Also, when I have a jquery object made by the following statement var dialog = $('<div>...</div>'); dialog.dialog({...}); this.element.data('mydialog', dialog); and then do this.element.bind('click', function() {$(this).data('mydialog').dialog('open');}); then I get an error about object not having property dialog??
[05:56:46] <mikunos> ok Cork
[05:57:56] <Cork> mazzachre: where are you doing this.element.bind ?
[05:58:14] <Cork> (and this.element.data)
[05:58:16] <mazzachre> Cork: in the widget _create()
[05:58:31] <Cork> ok, so your extending the ui.dialog?
[05:59:36] <mazzachre> http://jsfiddle.net/4Ez4X/14/
[05:59:55] <mazzachre> Cork: No, I am making my own widget, with a dialog
[06:00:14] <mazzachre> It is nothing special, just a helper function for our ui
[06:01:15] <Cork> mazzachre: little side note, you don't need to append the dialog html, jquery does that automatically when you run .dialog on it
[06:04:54] <grkblood_> how would i alter this jquery script to keep the blue div open when  I scroll over the dropdown selections? http://jsfiddle.net/7u9kW/
[06:05:44] <saddishwasher> morning all, I'm needing to chain toggleClass with a delay between them however .delay(int) does not seem to work (probably because its intended for pauses between .animate()'s)
[06:06:04] <saddishwasher> does anyone have a function to delay betwen toggleClass's
[06:10:01] <xec> saddishwasher: just use native js setTimeout()
[06:10:22] <saddishwasher> xec, yea I'm doing that now, just didn't know if there was something 'better'
[06:11:06] <xec> saddishwasher: depending on what you need, there might be, why do you want the delay?
[06:11:45] <saddishwasher> xec, I'm using css3 transitions to animate an element to a specified top margin then when I remove the class it should go back down
[06:12:16] <saddishwasher> xec, I'm brand-new to css3 though so not sure if there is something within that group that will acheive my goal
[06:13:51] <xec> saddishwasher: i'm not too familiar with css3 animations myself, but i think it should be possible to create the entire thing in css, as in both up & down after eachother
[06:14:03] <sodhi> Is it possible to animate to a certain location? I'm using toggle, however it defaults to toggle in the direction the window is positioned (i.e. if it's set to absolute and I've specified top and left, it'll toggle towards there)? I'm rather looking to have it toggle towards coordinate X and Y.
[06:14:04] <mazzachre> Cork: OK
[06:14:18] <nFFF>  Guys I have an ajaxcart on website, ajax add to basket -> on success of ajax request -> display shopping cart block on current page. This works fine, except it's not showing the updated cart, it's showing the old cart before the add
[06:14:41] <kanzie> Im trying to understand timestamps with Flotâ€¦has anyone worked with the flot-library and jQuery?
[06:14:59] <mazzachre> Cork: But can you help with my problem? First of all, why $(this).data('mydialog').dialog('open'); does not work?
[06:15:15] <saddishwasher> xec, thats what I was trying to find initially, there are css3 transition-delay's but thats only for chaining animations that are not the same property (they will conflict)
[06:15:16] <sodhi> nFFF: I'm confident we'll need to see some source to make heads or tails of that.
[06:17:11] <Cork> mazzachre: you have an updated copy of the code?
[06:17:44] <nFFF> sodhi :PP
[06:17:47] <Cork> mazzachre: the code here never saves a reference to the dialog
[06:18:06] <xec> saddishwasher: could you show me what you have so far?
[06:18:14] <Cork> mazzachre: oh wait it does
[06:18:27] <nFFF> http://pastebin.com/tQ72rQH8

[06:19:00] <Cork> mazzachre: anyway i got busy in phone, so... :)
[06:19:07] <nFFF> That php echo's the cart html
[06:19:15] <nFFF> However it's not returning the updated cart
[06:19:19] <nFFF> It's returning the old cart
[06:21:15] <crazydiamond> Hi. Has anyone error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'plusone' of undefined"? I'm trying to add +1 button to my page and it provides this error
[06:21:43] <xec> saddishwasher: i was thinking something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/RHQfh/
[06:21:49] <Cork> crazydiamond: your working on a variable that doesn't exist
[06:22:39] <mawalu> I want do write this javascript code in jquery.  http://jsfiddle.net/7Nj9c/
[06:22:50] <grkblood_> how would i alter this script to keep the blue div open when I scroll over the dropdown selections located in that div? http://jsfiddle.net/7u9kW/1/
[06:24:01] <crazydiamond> Cork: looks like this, but author of this tool is not me and it don't works when I'm trying to install it in correspondence to manual
[06:25:38] <Cork> ?.mouseenter @ grkblood

[06:25:40] <saddishwasher> xec, ok but I need to initiate it manually so it has to be done on addition of a class - and when the animation is done I need to remove the class so I can call it again later
[06:27:00] <saddishwasher> xec, sorry jsfiddle is running slow for me

[06:27:23] <mikunos> Cork nothing to do $('ul.topnav > li > ul.subnav > li.item a').removeAttr('href') remove all the nested links too
[06:28:34] <igcewieling1> Is there any way to find out the most recently clicked button on a page?  The only info can find relates to a button on a form.  I'm not doing this from a form.
[06:28:44] <saddishwasher> xec, I think that link you shared is what I'm looking for
[06:28:47] <saddishwasher> thank you
[06:29:01] <igcewieling1> I can't do it from inside a .click() either.
[06:32:49] <Cork> mikunos: can you remind me the url for the example
[06:33:04] <Cork> ah, found it
[06:34:33] <igcewieling1> Based on the lack of response I assume my question is stupid?
[06:34:50] <ChrisK3> is there a function in jQ that counts the number of items that match a selector?
[06:35:05] <Cork> igcewieling1: you need to store it on click
[06:35:12] <Cork> no premade solution
[06:35:19] <johnkpaul> ChrisK3: $(".my-seletor").length?
[06:35:46] <snagnever> hey! what would be the easing that starts slow and gets faster?
[06:36:45] <ChrisK3> johnkpaul: just give me "undefined"
[06:36:58] <johnkpaul> jQuery(".my-selector").length?
[06:37:11] <igcewieling1> Cork: *nod*  I tried that.  It seems the .blur() for a field is called before the .click() for the button.  So by the time the click() handler for the button is run the .blur() has already run and fails to find the variable I set in my.click() to indicate which button was clicked.   Looks like I'll have to find a different way.
[06:37:15] <g[r]eek> Hey fellas. Some assistance with Ajax please. I'm using .load(uri, data) to call a target PHP script. This script does some MySQL stuff. This MySQL stuff might succeed or it might fail. If it succeeds, I want to be able to show a success jQuery dialog with an Ok button, which when clicked redirects to the next page. If the MySQL stuff fails I want to show an error jQuery dialog with an Ok button that simply closes the dialog and stays on
[06:37:16] <g[r]eek>  the same page. The problem is I don't know how to do an Ajax call with 2 different outcomes. I only know how to use .load() to change the contents of the selected element to the Ajax call's output. Thanks
[06:37:29] <ChrisK3> johnkpaul: that works, odd
[06:37:46] <ChrisK3> what's the difference between $ and jQuery?
[06:37:55] <igcewieling1> I have a form field which needs to be validated then the field loses focus.  When I click on the Close button the validation code is still run, even though it should not be run.
[06:37:58] <Cork> igcewieling1: ya, blur runs before click, and by that defenition you don't know what button is comming
[06:38:02] <johnkpaul> $ can be reassigned because it's used in many libraries
[06:38:05] <johnkpaul> for example Prototype also uses $
[06:38:09] <johnkpaul> so it could be overwritten
[06:38:15] <ChrisK3> hmm, well I use $ elsewhere np
[06:38:17] <johnkpaul> jQuery is the global that you can use in almost allsituations
[06:38:23] <johnkpaul> without seeing the code, it's hard to tell
[06:38:29] <Cork> mikunos: do you have a fixed fiddle?
[06:38:30] <igcewieling1> Cork: do you have any ideas for not doing field validation when a close button is clicked?
[06:38:57] <Cork> igcewieling1: is the close button in the form?
[06:39:02] <g[r]eek> In other words, I'm calling .load(uri, data), and I want to popup different jQuery dialogs (these have already been pre-configured) depending on the Ajax call's outcome. What's the best way to do this? Thanks
[06:40:07] <igcewieling1> Cork: not at this time, but it could be if required.
[06:41:53] <nFFF> http://pastebin.com/tQ72rQH8  I'm making an ajax request, its to add products to the basket, on success I'm displaying the cart on the current page (line 14). Except it's showing the old cart i.e. the new products aren't shwoing, do I need to add some sort of ready function to line 14?
[06:41:59] <endberg> just a quick syntax question: http://jsfiddle.net/Q7xBG/1/
[06:42:52] <snagnever> is it much more heavier using $this.parents('.class') than using $this.parent().parent().parent() ?
[06:43:56] <jedimind> if you add $this.parents('.class').eq(0) it should be pretty fast
[06:43:57] <erichynds> snagnever: use closest()
[06:44:01] <jedimind> as that'll return the first one
[06:46:05] <snagnever> erichynds yeah, i've tried, but it haven't found...
[06:46:07] <snagnever> jedimind thanks!
[06:49:02] <g[r]eek> *bump* jQuery ajax question. I'm calling .load(uri, data), and I want to popup different jQuery dialogs (these have already been pre-configured) depending on the Ajax call's outcome. What's the best way to do this? Thanks
[06:51:07] <robo> is anyone here using backbone with jquery and loves it?
[06:54:39] <endberg> Im sorry, wrong link... so please help me the syntax here: http://jsfiddle.net/Q7xBG/1/
[06:55:18] <Barbaren> hello, i'm appending some elements to a table, but jquery also inserts a <tbody> tag into the table, why is it doing this and how can i get it to not do that? =)
[06:57:38] <kborchers> Barbaren: jQuery doesn't do that but some browsers do. You can't stop it so the best you can do is start using tbody in your tables then you'll know it's there in all browsers
[06:57:46] <morphles> What would be a good way to create associative array from jquery object? suppose there is something like <ul><li id="i_5">first</li><li id="i_7">second</li></ul>, so i get items with $('li') now i want to get somethg like ["5":"first","7":"second"], it have seen something with .get or .map, but those make nonasociative arrays, one of the examples was with global var, and somehow i have the feeling that using global var will be only way to acheve this...
[06:58:04] <Barbaren> kborchers: ok :(
[06:58:11] <igcewieling1> Cork: The only thing I can think of is in the blur() put a timer to fireoff the actual code after the global variable containing the button name is set by the click() handler.
[06:58:19] <igcewieling1> And that just seems *ugly*
[06:58:24] <Barbaren> kborchers: this is wierd though, it doesn't make any sense, why is the browser doing that?
[06:58:56] <Cork> "<Cork> igcewieling1: is the close button in the form?"
[06:59:03] <kborchers> Barbaren: because it's correct markup so it "fixes" it for you.
[06:59:06] <Cork> you never answerd that one
[06:59:24] <Cork> (and hurry up, i gtg)
[06:59:39] <igcewieling1> (9:40:07 AM) igcewieling1: Cork: not at this time, but it could be if required.
[07:00:34] <Barbaren> kborchers: ok, yeah, i just read that. so strange though, i've been developing web for ages and i never heard it before!
[07:00:50] <mawalu> Sorry I'm new in Jquery but i have a question. This code does not run but I don't knew why. http://jsfiddle.net/jndHv/
[07:01:32] <grkblood_> how would i alter this script so that scrolling over autofill generated lists from my cache in the text field doesnt doesnt close my div thats open while the mouse is over it? http://jsfiddle.net/7u9kW/2/
[07:01:48] <kborchers> ?learn @ mawalu
[07:01:49] <bot-t1> mawalu, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[07:11:54] <ph88> sometimes the mouseleave() is not triggered, how can i fix this ?
[07:12:17] <johnkpaul> ph88: do you have any more information than that? in what situation is it nottriggered?
[07:12:37] <pringlescan> Does anyone know why a browser would bypass my jQuery click handler for hyperlinks with hrefs that start with "#show" or "#view"? Those anchors don't exist on my page.
[07:13:08] <ph88> johnkpaul:  when i move my mouse fast, the mouseleave event is on a div with 200px by 40px
[07:13:09] <mansoor> pringlescan, define bypass
[07:13:55] <johnkpaul> in most cases, I'd use hoverIntent instead of mouseleave to avoid problems like this, but if you put it onto jsfiddle, I can take a look, ph88
[07:19:01] <endberg> bye
[07:19:57] <ph88> johnkpaul:  http://jsfiddle.net/zpBhc/1/
[07:20:33] <ph88> johnkpaul:  the javascript code is taken directly from my website and it works there (without the little bug when moving mouse fast) ... however i can't get it to work in the fiddle o_O
[07:20:42] <error4o4> having problems with content positioned absolute inside a div dissapering during animation. any idea?   visual example: http://jsfiddle.net/PbhyU/11/
[07:22:56] <johnkpaul> ph88: I am confused about what your code is trying to do,
[07:23:01] <johnkpaul> the control1 and control2 are hidden
[07:23:03] <johnkpaul> as your code says to do
[07:23:10] <johnkpaul> and mouseleaving is hiding it again, which doesn't change anything
[07:23:12] <johnkpaul> because it's already hidden
[07:26:48] <ph88> johnkpaul:  on mouseenter if inner-div is hidden then show with fade effect
[07:33:30] <iamcurio> any idea why my .js won't allow my <a href=""> tags to work? even though they are there on hover it won't click to link
[07:34:20] <muszek> hi... what's the opposite to parseJSON()?
[07:34:25] <ph88> johnkpaul:  maybe this explains it better http://jsfiddle.net/zpBhc/2/  ... you see the javascript works  ... i don't really know why it is not showing "hai hai
[07:34:31] <ph88> " on my site it works though
[07:34:37] <muszek> I want to turn object into a JSON string...
[07:34:50] <bot-t1> muszek, JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[07:35:04] <ph88> lol
[07:35:07] <ph88> nice bot
[07:35:24] <muszek> bot-t1: thanks
[07:35:24] <bot-t1> muszek, I'm a bot you know..
[07:35:37] <ph88> it's really a bot ...
[07:35:38] <muszek> bot-t1: who triggered you then?
[07:35:39] <bot-t1> muszek, My reply is no.
[07:35:45] <ph88> lol
[07:35:54] <muszek> who is no?
[07:35:54] <ph88> you triggered it by keywords in your question
[07:36:00] <muszek> :)
[07:39:28] <Vorspire> why does IE9 hate jQuery so much?
[07:39:53] <Vorspire> Standard UIDialog -> layout fail
[07:42:01] <devmikey> Question: Is there javascript to force a cache file to be refreshed?
[07:42:02] <devmikey> Sorry, wrong chan
[07:42:59] <mazzachre> Can I parse a function reference to an object in an object? Say, I have a list of data I want to set on some input fields, but some of these input fields are jqueryui enhanced, so I should use whatever "set" functionality they provide instead of .val(*) Can I somehow give a reference to "whatever set functionality" in an object?
[07:43:19] <smplstk> devmikey: just append a query param and new Date()
[07:43:34] <devmikey> smplstk: Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
[07:43:56] <smplstk> devmikey: ?
[07:44:07] <devmikey> I hate doing that, lol.
[07:44:23] <smplstk> well - that's the only way I know
[07:44:28] <devmikey> You should have seen the big forum I had yesterday about it
[07:44:44] <smplstk> it's simple, and it works.
[07:45:07] <smplstk> I guess alternatively you could load the file in via ajax, and specify the cache param as false
[07:45:19] <devmikey> that's what I do now
[07:45:26] <mazzachre> Like, data: {test: "31-12-2012"}, metadata: {test: "datepicker.setDate"} and then in the function know that when I come to field "test" instead of $(field).val(value) I do $(field).datepicker('setDate', value); ??
[07:45:30] <devmikey> but requires jquery afaik
[07:46:12] <smplstk> ya - it's not as easy as new Date()
[07:46:27] <devmikey> I like it better though
[07:48:16] <sodhi> I'm having some issues with jQueryUI, specifically the effect 'scale'. I have a div nested within another div, and upon using scale on the parent div, the nested div's background does not scale, leaving it behind as a "standalone" div. Can anyone propose a fix?
[07:52:18] <Demp> how do I check if an element has a 'mouseover' event binded to it?
[07:55:07] <NoiseEee> Demp: i don't think there's any reliable way
[07:55:27] <Demp> that's too bad
[07:56:58] <mazzachre> If I have a jquery object pointing to an element in DOM, can I somehow easily check what kind (if any) of jqueryui widget is attached to this element?
[08:00:53] <Murof> all: Morning ^^
[08:01:44] <Jonno_FTW> hello
[08:02:05] <AdvoWork> if im doign $('#status_raised').prepend(..img..) can i clear that first at the same time somehow/
[08:02:20] <Vorspire> clear?
[08:03:07] <AdvoWork> as a seperate command though or at the same time as doing that, can i do .prepend().clear()?
[08:03:39] <Jonno_FTW> AdvoWork: you could do, $("#status_raised").html('')
[08:03:46] <NoiseEee> use empty()
[08:03:52] <Jonno_FTW> or that
[08:03:58] <Vorspire> I was cofused as there is no .clear()
[08:04:10] <alexr2> is there any way for jquery to parse a date like 2012-01-30T15:25:58.00Z to a regular javascript Date() object?  (ie7/8 can't handle it)
[08:04:27] <Vorspire> alexr2 yes: new Date( string )
[08:04:47] <Vorspire> it should parse your date
[08:04:50] <alexr2> ie7/8 can't handle new Date(string) like that...
[08:04:53] <Jonno_FTW> I am trying to use this plugin http://tablesorter.com/docs/ here, but I can't get it to sort on checkboxes, when using the textExtraction parameter
[08:04:57] <alexr2> which is why i mentioned ie7/8 can't handle it
[08:05:37] <Vorspire> then convert it to a timestamp
[08:05:39] <krz> damn, can anyone recommend a good javascript file uploader that just works. tried plupload and uploadify. fancy upload looks good but is only for mootools
[08:05:53] <krz> ill even pay for the software, if such a thing exists
[08:06:13] <Vorspire> krz you could just mak your own with ajaz and PHP processing
[08:06:30] <krz> Vorspire: what using swupload?
[08:06:37] <Vorspire> man my typo's are out in force tonight :/
[08:06:44] <Vorspire> no i mean.. write the thing yourself :P
[08:06:51] <Vorspire> an uploader from scratch
[08:07:11] <krz> i need to submit the file via ajax to s3 directly
[08:07:25] <krz> and i don't want to reinvent the wheel
[08:07:37] <moesti> hi, can anyone say me ho i can get for every file the progressbar? i only can access the whole progress....https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Basic-plugin
[08:09:27] <seraphim> so does anyone know why i would be able to post variables with no response?
[08:09:38] <seraphim> even though i get a 200 OK reply?
[08:11:45] <Vorspire> seraphim 200 just means the page/target loaded fine, what kind out data are you expecting back?
[08:15:55] <seraphim> basically numbers
[08:16:00] <seraphim> im echoing the numbers back too :/
[08:16:05] <seraphim> ill post my code hold on
[08:16:13] <Vorspire> ahh you need to format them as JSON
[08:16:20] <Vorspire> i guess you're doing ajax call to PHP
[08:18:03] <seraphim> yeah
[08:18:08] <Vorspire> seraphim the answer to your problem is probably: echo json_encode( Array( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ) ); -this will then become available to ajax.success as data
[08:18:09] <seraphim> http://jsfiddle.net/MeM5H/
[08:22:10] <seraphim> bah. nothing
[08:22:20] <Vorspire> seraphim think this might do it
[08:22:22] <Vorspire> http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/MeM5H/2/
[08:22:53] <Vorspire> see how 'value' is assigned to $jsonArr - it becomes available to data (result) as result.value or result[value']
[08:23:26] <Vorspire> json_encode will output this: { value: 0 }
[08:25:31] <seraphim> ah ok
[08:25:34] <seraphim> ill give it a try
[08:25:46] <Vorspire> good luck :)
[08:25:50] <Vorspire> there is another way actually
[08:26:09] <Vorspire> output a raw html element with echo instead of 0 or 1
[08:27:06] <Jonno_FTW> isIs anyone else getting 502 erors on jsfiddle?
[08:27:30] <Vorspire> jafiddle has been bugging out for me for a couple days randomly
[08:27:36] <Vorspire> jsfiddle*
[08:27:51] <Vorspire> sean` :)
[08:28:10] <seraphim> i got a reply of "null" which ofc means empty..
[08:28:34] <Vorspire> seraphim you need to tell your ajax request to expect json i think
[08:28:51] <joshualibrarian> okay... I am so stumped... I whiddled it down to something managable in side... http://jsfiddle.net/Q6KbM/26/
[08:29:20] <Phrogz> Given a <tr> node, what's a good way to find the closest previous tr sibling that has a 'th' child node?
[08:29:53] <Phrogz> Do I have to just while() and walk the previousSibling myself?
[08:30:04] <Vorspire> prevUntil i think
[08:30:09] <Vorspire> ?prevUntil
[08:30:10] <bot-t1> .prevUntil([selector], [filter]): Get all preceding siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/prevUntil/
[08:30:33] <Vorspire> joshualibrarian what are you trying to achieve?
[08:30:56] <Phrogz> Vorspire: Thanks.
[08:31:01] <Vorspire> yw
[08:31:14] <sean`> hey Vorspire
[08:31:15] <sean`> hows it
[08:31:34] <seraphim> its weird cause i always echo 1 or 0 and it always works except now lol
[08:31:44] <Vorspire> Not too bad sean` feel like too long since I've been in here hehe
[08:31:47] <joshualibrarian> Vorspire:  at this point I'm trying to get that code to compile... and then I'm trying to figure out how to maintain my scope inside of those animate return functions... at the moment, I am baffled why it won't run at all... I have scoured it over and over for syntax, and it seems corrent.
[08:31:56] <sean`> ha
[08:32:36] <Vorspire> joshualibrarian unexpected token }
[08:32:37] <joshualibrarian> Vorspire:  okay, wait.. there's a proiblem.
[08:33:08] <joshualibrarian> Vorspire:  after an hour, I finally just found it (of course!)  now I'm trying to show the problem...
[08:33:12] <Jonno_FTW> I am using a table sorting plugin, but my function I wrote to sort on checkboxes doesn't update, http://jsfiddle.net/ayYXS/3/
[08:33:16] <Jonno_FTW> what have I done wronG?
[08:34:11] <joshualibrarian> Vorspire:  there it is!
[08:34:13] <joshualibrarian> http://jsfiddle.net/Q6KbM/30/
[08:34:26] <joshualibrarian> why does my self variable loose scope, and how can I keep hold of it?
[08:34:57] <joshualibrarian> I need to be able to reassign currentSlide when the animation finishes.
[08:36:09] <moesti> can anyone explain me how i can get the uploadprogress for every uploadpoart in this plugin? https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options
[08:36:48] <Vorspire> joshualibrarian - it loses scope because it's not within a scope that it's defined in
[08:37:08] <nisseni> I have a from and to date using datepicker, from can't be later than to - I'm saving that form with ajax, so the page doesn't reload. This, however, results in that the "from" field isn't resetted. The result of this is that the to date can't be a date after the one I selected when saving the first time, I've tried clearing the input field, but this doesn't do the trick
[08:37:40] <joshualibrarian> Vorspire:  how can I pass it that self variable to maintain it's scope and use it in there?
[08:39:05] <seraphim> ./rage
[08:39:28] <Jonno_FTW> bash: ./rage: No such file or directory
[08:39:39] <thang> ls
[08:39:57] <Jonno_FTW> ragequit.sh
[08:41:44] <Vorspire> joshualibrarian I think "self" will need to be defined before $.widget is called, to provide global scope for the entire app, where you set "self" is the key part to it working after that
[08:42:00] <Vorspire> are you trying to sequentially animate elements?
[08:42:03] <lsone> anyone know why http://jsfiddle.net/gLU7T/5/ would work in the preview window, but when loaded into a browser the li items are not loading the new pages?
[08:42:24] <joshualibrarian> Vorspire: but self is a member variable OF each widget.
[08:43:34] <joshualibrarian> Vorspire: yes, in some instances, but also simply when the animation finishes, the variable that the rest of the widget uses to hold the currentSlide needs to be updated, to show slides have changed... so I need to accesss it from in there.  And there's a copy for each instance of the widget.
[08:43:40] <joshualibrarian> of which in my real code I have several on a page.
[08:45:06] <Vorspire> joshualibrarian ahh then I think you might have to re-think the widget syntax/scope logic, self is surely not defined outside of that one function, when other functions require it
[08:48:05] <joshualibrarian> Vorspire:  self is accessible from all of the functions of that widget.  the whole archetecture has been working great, is there not simply some way to pass that variable into that complete: function({}) ?
[08:49:01] <seraphim> im going crazy because i dont know jquery enough lol
[08:49:22] <Vorspire> seraphim; don't worry, it's an accuired taste
[08:49:28] <Vorspire> ?jqeng
[08:49:28] <bot-t1> English jQuery users may be offended by the accessor $, if offense occurs, change $ to £ and bang head on desk.
[08:49:45] <seraphim> XD
[08:49:48] <hex`> What's the correct way to avoid code repetition, as explained in http://pastie.org/3283227?
[08:50:03] <Vorspire> encapsulation :P
[08:50:34] <MagePsycho> Hi Guys
[08:50:34] <seraphim> what about
[08:50:35] <seraphim> http://jsfiddle.net/MeM5H/
[08:50:42] <seraphim> i wonder if that changes things
[08:50:46] <seraphim> idk what it does
[08:50:56] <seraphim> but i can only assume lol
[08:52:26] <joshualibrarian> http://jsfiddle.net/Q6KbM/31/ please, how I can get access to the widget instance from inside the animate's complete callback?!
[08:52:48] <Vorspire> (seraphim): you almost had it :)
[08:52:48] <seraphim> poop it didnt update
[08:52:50] <MagePsycho> how to find if we are at the bottom of the scrolling div using jQuery?
[08:52:50] <Vorspire> http://pastie.org/3283259
[08:52:53] <Whirl3d> if I use var foc=$("form").find(":focus"); does it return a jquery object containing the focus like I'd expect, or does it return the actual element focused? For some reason $("form").find(":focus").is(".someClass") is returning an error.
[08:54:00] <Whirl3d> nvm, my error
[08:54:09] <Vorspire> Whirl3d it will return any elements that are focused
[08:54:23] <hex`> What's the correct way to avoid code repetition, as explained in http://pastie.org/3283227? is the correct way to use form.find("input")?
[08:54:35] <Vorspire> hex` http://pastie.org/3283259
[08:54:40] <Whirl3d> Vorspire, can multiple elements have focus?
[08:54:49] <Vorspire> I don't think so
[08:54:52] <hex`> Vorspire:  hmmm... thank you very much!
[08:54:52] <Vorspire> Not sure
[08:55:04] <Vorspire> hex` welcome :)
[08:55:12] <Whirl3d> vorspire, thx for the replies.
[08:55:18] <Vorspire> yw
[08:55:39] <seraphim> http://pastebin.com/SupsQyia <--- is what im trying now lol
[08:57:21] <seraphim> i give up ._.
[09:01:10] <Whirl3d> since the focusout event is fired before the focusin event, how do you determine whether the new focused element is part of the same parent element? Rather how can you deteremine new focus on focusout?
[09:04:00] <seraphim> so does anyone want to just write me a script? :D Xd
[09:04:18] <sodhi> Is it possible to restore the previous value of a .effects('scale', {percent:0}); action to an element?
[09:04:27] <moesti> [Object { name="/www/htdocs/w55ec9cTest...ds/server.start._up.pdf", size="45.09kB", type="application/pdf", mehr...}], how can i access this json request=?
[09:04:31] <sodhi> previous value of height and width
[09:05:01] <moesti> e.size donÂ´t work
[09:07:12] <sodhi> wouldn't it be e.size[0]?
[09:11:23] <hex`> Why $("form input") works but not form.children("input")? http://pastie.org/3283390
[09:11:57] <Eviltwin> form.find("input") would be the equivalent of $("form input")
[09:12:15] <Eviltwin> Whereas form.children("input") is the equivalent of $("form > input")
[09:13:32] <eipark> has anyone ever had an issue where .submit() attachÃ©d to a form didn't work when the submit button was clicked?
[09:13:33] <muzone> www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbVifPkbYsk lol
[09:14:10] <Eviltwin> eipark: No, never
[09:14:11] <hex`> Eviltwin: hmmm ok
[09:14:35] <eipark> it is only responding to hitting enter when focused on a form fieldâ€¦ but not when i actually click the submit button attached to the form
[09:15:58] <interopcop> if there's a syntax error in a js file included in a page, could that cause subsequent js files to not work without reporting errors?
[09:16:02] <Eviltwin> muzone: I'm never going to see that pledge, am I?
[09:16:26] <interopcop> I'm trying to use the treeview plugin and it's not working for no good reason
[09:16:34] <EpiphanyG> yes, interopcop
[09:16:41] <interopcop> figured :(
[09:18:14] <EpiphanyG> you would probably get an error in console though
[09:18:33] <EpiphanyG> like maybe something not being defined that should be if the js would load completely
[09:20:20] <Vorspire> if something isn't defined the JS will still load, if there's a syntax error it will break the entire page (based on experience)
[09:20:44] <muzone> Eviltwin: you need to trust in a brother
[09:21:17] <muzone> if i would have lied to you i wouldn't still have stuck around, now would i
[09:22:04] <hex`> Which script do you guys recommend to minify my html page (containing css and javascript at the file)
[09:22:16] <muzone> hex`: uglifyjs for the js
[09:22:22] <muzone> as for the html, now thats hard
[09:22:32] <muzone> if you use nginx you can get it to gz compress your html
[09:22:40] <muzone> otherwise if you use rails you can do some advanced trickery like
[09:22:41] <muzone> hold up
[09:23:00] <hex`> don't worry muzone
[09:23:24] <muzone> def join_html_output
[09:23:30] <muzone>   response.body.gsub!(/>\s+</, '><')
[09:23:32] <muzone> end
[09:23:36] <muzone> put that in a controller
[09:23:45] <muzone> i know google does it like that
[09:23:59] <muzone> every other person i ask though seems to laugh at the idea
[09:24:51] <hex`> ok man... thanks muzone :)
[09:25:24] <muzone> hex`: why you ask anyway?
[09:26:04] <hex`> just for curiosity... I created a simple page, but I want to make it harder to understand the DOM, the javascript, css etc... I can't deny the copy, but I can make it harder
[09:26:12] <muzone> hehe
[09:26:17] <muzone> yeah im in the same position
[09:26:33] <NoiseEee> hex`: put it on an intranet and don't let anyone view it
[09:26:34] <muzone> you dont want anybody stealing your precious shit huh hehe
[09:26:53] <techouse> how do i get the last element of a JS array?
[09:27:03] <hex`> NoiseEee: I think I'll just let it accesible through http://127.0.0.1/ :P
[09:27:09] <techouse> myArray[myArray.length - 1]?
[09:27:12] <hex`> muzone:  exactly... "my preciouusss"
[09:27:20] <Vorspire> techhouse: array[array.length - 1];
[09:27:24] <muzone> hhhhhhhhhh :D
[09:27:27] <muzone> indeed
[09:28:02] <NoiseEee> techhelp: last()
[09:28:13] <interopcop> I can't figiure out why this script is not working - its not showing errors.  In chrome's inspector I don't see any errors but I also can't tell if the jquery selector is finding my div
[09:28:39] <interopcop> how can I tell if the jquery is finding my div?
[09:29:06] <Vorspire> interopcop if($("#selector").length){ }
[09:29:15] <techouse> NoiseEee: ?!
[09:29:24] <techouse> javascript
[09:29:29] <techouse> doesn't have last()
[09:29:34] <Vorspire> techouse; use arr[ arr.length - 1 ];
[09:29:53] <techouse> yea, as i thought
[09:30:02] <techouse> the fool-proof method
[09:30:10] <Vorspire> techouse it doesn't have .last because it's not a jQuery object :)
[09:30:13] <krz> if no flash is installed. and one browses to http://www.plupload.com/example_custom.php it'll launch a popup box: http://imagebin.org/196366 how do they do it?
[09:30:19] <krz> a flash detection script of some sort?
[09:30:29] <Vorspire> i suppose $([1,2,3]).last() may work?
[09:30:45] <Eviltwin> Don't do that
[09:30:49] <interopcop> Vorspire: and maybe put in an alert("found it!"); in the curly braces?
[09:30:57] <interopcop> sorry I'm pre-school on javascript
[09:31:17] <Vorspire> never use alert :)
[09:31:21] <EpiphanyG> interopcop: are you using a developer console of any kind?
[09:31:23] <Vorspire> use console.log()
[09:31:33] <EpiphanyG> if firefox, install firebug, if chrome, hit F12
[09:31:43] <danzik17> if IE, install Chrome.
[09:31:44] <EpiphanyG> if IE, stop developing ;)
[09:31:50] <D3adM3at> F12 on IE8 and 9 too
[09:31:57] <Vorspire> if IE, /quit life
[09:32:13] <interopcop> EpiphanyG: can you recommend an open-source one?
[09:32:14] <D3adM3at> Well, and give up 50% of the web?
[09:32:26] <D3adM3at> I hate IE
[09:32:27] <EpiphanyG> what browser are you using?
[09:32:32] <D3adM3at> but can't ignore it
[09:32:50] <EpiphanyG> D3adM3at, I'm saying it's ok to developer FOR ie, just not in IE :D
[09:33:37] <Vorspire> IE 9 is even worse than 6,7,8 and still doesn't style things properly, so annoying.. a standard jQueryUI Dialog doesn't work properly, try to resize and it glitches, etc
[09:33:58] <D3adM3at> Well, is that IE or jQuery fault?
[09:34:02] <interopcop> I don't think I am - I' using Chrome "inspect element"
[09:34:18] <EpiphanyG> ah cool, that'll work interopcop
[09:34:31] <D3adM3at> IE sucks hard, but I suspect jQuery hasn't caught up to IE9
[09:34:33] <EpiphanyG> click on "Console" and in there you can type stuff
[09:34:37] <interopcop> so I don't know how to use it then
[09:34:39] <interopcop> ok
[09:34:43] <minijupe> how do I check if an element has a given attribute defined?
[09:34:46] <EpiphanyG> try typing 1+1
[09:34:49] <Vorspire> Obviously it's IE's fault :P it's funy though that the same code taken from the jqueryui.com site for a basic dialog messes up, but the demo site works fine
[09:35:01] <interopcop> returns 2 :)
[09:35:06] <EpiphanyG> yay \o/
[09:35:16] <interopcop> woot
[09:35:22] <interopcop> now...
[09:35:27] <EpiphanyG> now try $("#selector").length
[09:35:29] <Vorspire> minijupe try .hasAttr()
[09:35:41] <minijupe> Vorspire: tnx
[09:35:49] <EpiphanyG> (replacing #selector with whatever you wanted to find)
[09:36:29] <interopcop> EpiphanyG: returns 1
[09:36:42] <interopcop> there are 3 id's on this page - the first returns 1, the other two return 0
[09:36:48] <EpiphanyG> cool, 1 means it's found it. It has found 1 matching element
[09:37:07] <EpiphanyG> that might be your problem then, if it can't see the other two
[09:37:55] <minijupe> Vorspire: no method hasAttr
[09:38:17] <Vorspire> ?hasAttr
[09:38:18] <bot-t1> Vorspire, .hasAttr([ element ]) - Bug Tracker - jQuery - http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9396
[09:38:47] <Vorspire> minijupe that will happen if you call it on a non-jQuery object
[09:39:27] <minijupe>   $('#new_image .gets_spinning_wheel').hasAttr('data-timeout') TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'hasAttr'
[09:39:30] <minijupe> Vorspire: ^
[09:39:46] <Vorspire> ahh maybe it doesn't actually exist lmao, my bad
[09:40:18] <EpiphanyG> does hasAttr exist in the API?
[09:40:19] <minijupe> Vorspire: http://api.jquery.com/?ns0=1&s=hasAttr
[09:40:38] <Vorspire> well; if (elem.attr("data-timeout").length){ } //returned a string with > 0 chars
[09:41:09] <EpiphanyG> can do if ($('#new_image .gets_spinning_wheel').attr('data-timeout') ) maybe?
[09:41:44] <Vorspire> stick .length on there - 0 represents false in a boolean context in JS
[09:41:54] <Vorspire> anything > 0 is true
[09:42:19] <grisun> Hi! I'd like to show a blockUI window while a page is loading (i.e. the user clicks on a button and it should show a "loading…" overlay while the page is loading in the background
[09:42:27] <grisun> is that possible with jQuery?
[09:42:42] <EpiphanyG> fair enough, but undefined would also evaluate to false?
[09:43:04] <minijupe> EpiphanyG: Vorspire: I don't do a lot of JS, does undefined eval to false in if statement?
[09:43:13] <Vorspire> yes
[09:43:40] <minijupe> ok that's good enough i think: if (  $('#new_image .gets_spinning_wheel').attr('data-timeout')) { alert ('y'); } else { alert ('n') }
[09:43:43] <Vorspire> it's a good way to check if things exist too
[09:47:22] <Vorspire> ?eval var obj = { one: { }, two: [1,2,3], three: "Hello World" }; print( obj.one + ' | ' + obj.two + ' | ' + obj.three + ' | ' + obj.four );
[09:47:24] <bot-t1> Vorspire: "[object Object] | 1,2,3 | Hello World | undefined"
[09:50:55] <Dooberry> 'lo. Having some problems with alert messages in Firefox, basically disappearing as soon as they show up
[09:51:04] <Dooberry> (before I begin, I don't usually go anywhere near JS so consider me a total noob)
[09:51:18] <Vorspire> don't use alerts :)
[09:51:23] <Dooberry> i'm basically using the same code as http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_livesearch.asp but i'm trying to show an alert when the user presses enter
[09:51:31] <Dooberry> haha, see i'm off to a flying start
[09:51:54] <Vorspire> :D alerts will be the death of your app, intrusive and blocking as they are
[09:51:59] <brettster> does anyone see anything wrong with this. It isn't working in jquery
[09:51:59] <brettster> http://pastie.org/3283606
[09:52:12] <Vorspire> use console.log( value ); instead of alert( value );
[09:52:22] <Dooberry> i'll give it a whirl and get back to you, cheers
[09:52:31] <Vorspire> gl :)
[09:54:13] <brettster> anyone?
[09:54:27] <brettster> i meant to say it isnt working in IE 7
[09:54:30] <EpiphanyG> what specifically is going wrong?
[09:54:56] <brettster> Well, if you look at cityofoneonta.org.s109594.gridserver.com
[09:55:01] <brettster> you'll see some corny animation
[09:55:03] <Dooberry> hmm, Vorspire - seems that console.bug is predominantly for developers. I'm just trying to show end users that they can't press enter, and they've got to choose a dropdown isntead
[09:55:08] <brettster> if you look at that in ie7
[09:55:16] <brettster> none of the elements show up AT ALL.
[09:55:33] <Vorspire> Dooberry ahh, are you using jQueryUI at all?
[09:55:47] <EpiphanyG> hah, I don't think it's that corny :D kinda fun use of jquery :D better than flash
[09:55:56] <Dooberry> nope - literally has no JS experience, just trying to bodge http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_livesearch.asp
[09:55:56] <EpiphanyG> you should pre-load the images though imho ;)
[09:56:02] <EpiphanyG> anyways... IE7 you say?
[09:56:04] <Dooberry> mode code is literally 1:1 with the W3CSchools code
[09:56:28] <Dooberry> wow - lotta typos
[09:56:52] <NoiseEee> Dooberry: you need to find another resource to learn from
[09:56:56] <EpiphanyG> dooberry, maybe use jquery for ajax, rather than some random w3schools stuff
[09:57:05] <EpiphanyG> w3schools is often inaccurate
[09:57:23] <Dooberry> it's working okay for what I need it to do, it's just that it doesn't work when the user press enter
[09:57:25] <Vorspire> W3CSchools aren't standards complient so it seems compared to what they claim lol
[09:57:35] <Dooberry> so i'm trying to create an alert when the user presses enter
[09:57:59] <Dooberry> the one i've got works fine in IE and Chrome, but in Firefox the page automatically refreshes so closes the alert down in about 1/2 sec
[09:58:24] <brettster> EpihanyG - I actually am in the process of setting them up
[09:58:28] <Dooberry> (will take on board the comments re: W3Cschool however )
[09:58:31] <Vorspire> Dooberry, sounds like you need to return false on the event after sending the alert
[09:58:35] <brettster> but any ideas on whats going on in IE 7
[09:58:40] <EpiphanyG> brettster, I can't test IE7 currently, I'm not on my testing workstation
[09:58:58] <Dooberry> already have Vorspire, no luck though.
[09:59:14] <Dooberry> it's literally on the line after the alert
[09:59:20] <Dooberry> within the if statement
[09:59:29] <Vorspire> can you show us some code?
[09:59:40] <Dooberry> sure, one sec
[10:00:04] <minijupe> can i set the milliseconds as a string here:         setTimeout(function(){ ...  }, $(this).attr('data-timeout'));}
[10:00:56] <EpiphanyG> brett: I get error on line 201 char 9, object doesn't support this property or method
[10:01:22] <Dooberry> et la voila - http://jsfiddle.net/catgk/
[10:01:34] <EpiphanyG> and line 47 char 56
[10:01:51] <chovy> does anyone know what this does: if ( !+(this.value) ) { .. }
[10:02:26] <chovy> i've never seen the "+" used like this before.
[10:02:46] <Dooberry> (not included the PHP bit btw)
[10:02:53] <Vorspire> it's the same as Math.Abs i think
[10:03:49] <Vorspire> prefixing numbers with the + operator will turn -100 to 100 and opposite effect when prefixing with -
[10:05:15] <EpiphanyG> brett: maybe try window.setTimeout
[10:05:23] <EpiphanyG> not sure if it makes any difference though.
[10:06:12] <MoTiOnXml> 1Â½ month ago since somebody posted on the jQuery blog
[10:06:19] <MoTiOnXml> somebody do something about it :)
[10:07:27] <e-anima> anyone here using jstree? http://www.jstree.com/documentation/themes
[10:07:38] <e-anima> i have problems adding a custom theme
[10:07:50] <Dooberry> i recon it could have something to do with the xmlhttp.open and xmlhttp.send running as soon as the alert pops up
[10:08:10] <Dooberry> which effectively refreshes the page
[10:08:14] <Dooberry> and removed the alert
[10:09:28] <interopcop> EpiphanyG: It finds the id, but it still doesn't work.  My "unobtrusive javascript" js script is this:  https://gist.github.com/1705726
[10:09:34] <interopcop> anything I'm doing wrong there?
[10:09:37] <Vorspire> Dooberry, the problem with alert is that it's blocking - any code directly after the alert call within it's scope will be blocked until the alert has an action taken on it
[10:09:51] <EpiphanyG> without seeing the html too, I have no idea, sorry cop
[10:10:06] <Vorspire> so you could put the code that's forcing the refresh just after the alert
[10:10:08] <interopcop> but those lines don't look screwed up?
[10:10:27] <Chopps> hey guys, quick question, is getElementById("#elem") the same as $("#elem") ??
[10:10:30] <EpiphanyG> they look pretty normal to me
[10:10:44] <EpiphanyG> maybe treeview doesn't like multiple instances? I don't know, never used it before
[10:11:02] <interopcop> I'll try single instances
[10:11:19] <EpiphanyG> getElementById("elem") is the same as $("#elem")  (elem for js, #elem for jquery)
[10:11:45] <Chopps> thanks EpiphanyG
[10:11:48] <EpiphanyG> but not exactly the same, you can't run jquery methods on something you don't use $ for
[10:12:01] <Dooberry> Vorspire - that's what I thought, that nothing could run whilst the alert is being shown. Strangely enough though, the refresh still takes place. I'll move the code around a bit and see if that helps... If you have any suggestions though please feel free! http://jsfiddle.net/catgk/
[10:12:46] <Chopps> well EpiphanyG i need to pass an element to a function, so i guess it will not matter which one i use
[10:12:54] <Chopps> thanks for the quick reply man
[10:13:01] <EpiphanyG> np
[10:13:22] <Vorspire> Dooberry I think jsfiddle is taking you for a ride :) i think it's broken atm
[10:13:55] <Dooberry> typical...
[10:16:06] <codepal> Dooberry, use JSLint on your code before asking here - http://jsfiddle.net/catgk/1/
[10:17:22] <jeffsmykil> has anyone run into the issue where whatever they click on gets put in the modal dialog window with jquery ui?  I must be missing something, im just not sure what
[10:17:22] <Lann> heyas
[10:18:17] <Lann> I am having an issue where I'm jusing JQuery.load() on a div and the destination URL is redirecting the user twice with 302's. The output never renders. Workarounds?
[10:18:45] <Dooberry> thanks codepal - didn't think it would have been incorrect since I pulled it from W3CSchools!
[10:19:32] <EpiphanyG> http://w3fools.com/ <-- spread the word ;)
[10:19:34] <codepal> yeah - I don't think jsfiddle likes <script> tags in it's javascript
[10:19:55] <Dooberry> all fixed now at http://jsfiddle.net/catgk/1/
[10:20:05] <Vorspire> http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/catgk/2/
[10:20:12] <Vorspire> was gonna say i just cleaned it lol
[10:20:16] <Dooberry> Epiphany - haha, not seen that before
[10:21:22] <Vorspire> haha w3fools, that's a good one and damned true in an case
[10:21:45] <Vorspire> i used to use W3CSchools back in the day, it's still good for learning the basic concepts of OOP on the web with JS
[10:22:12] <D3adM3at> Lann: The browser should handle re-directs for you.
[10:22:31] <EpiphanyG> Vorspire: it's a valid entry point, can't deny that
[10:22:45] <EpiphanyG> but these days there are far better resources, just wish google would stop promoting w3schools :D
[10:23:05] <chovy> Lann: is it cross domain?
[10:23:17] <dddbmt__> In this article under the array iterations (http://docs.jquery.com/Types#Iteration_2) it says "When performance is critical, reading the length property only once can help to speed things up. This should be used only when a performance bottleneck was discovered:"
[10:23:22] <chovy> ie: the redirect location is a diff. domain?
[10:23:37] <dddbmt__> Why shouldn't I always only read the length once?
[10:24:40] <Vorspire> so you don't have to access array.length sequentially, every call to array.length internally iterates the collection to find the count of items contained - you should only get array.length once
[10:25:05] <Lann> chovy: yes
[10:25:12] <Lann> hahahaha
[10:25:22] <Lann> is that blocked by same domain policy?
[10:25:24] <chovy> Lann: you can add headers to allow it.
[10:25:33] <dddbmt__> Vorspire, But the article says I should only do it if I discover a bottleneck.
[10:25:33] <Lann> what do you mean?
[10:25:34] <chovy> yes
[10:25:49] <dddbmt__> Vorspire, So what you said is exactly my point.
[10:25:51] <chovy> Lann: there are headers you can add that will allow the resource to be fetched cross domain.
[10:25:59] <Vorspire> doesn't just apply to array.length - it applies to everything - if you need to access a variable more than once and it's value remains consistent like .length then you should cache it into a local variable
[10:26:03] <Lann> or i could just use an iframe right?
[10:26:04] <chovy> or don't redirect to a different domain.
[10:26:06] <jeffsmykil> anyone?  modal dialogs moving the clicked object?
[10:26:09] <Lann> instead of trying to .load the page
[10:26:28] <chovy> Lann: do you have control over the redirected resource?
[10:26:57] <Vorspire> it shouldn't be done if a bottle-neck is found, it should be done to prevent a bottle-neck xD
[10:27:06] <Lann> chovy: no
[10:27:28] <chovy> Lann, yeah, then iframe i think is your only solution, or a server side proxy
[10:27:48] <Lann> ah ok, that was a fun one to figure out
[10:28:07] <Vorspire> doesn't ajax support the crossDomain true/false option now?
[10:28:10] <Lann> trying to open facebook's oauth window in a css popup
[10:29:05] <chovy> Vorspire: the domain that you're requesting needs to allow it to be fetched cross domain.
[10:31:29] <Dooberry> just done a bit more digging... when I trigger the alert the console reports "[18:30:05.437] uncaught exception: [Exception... "prompt aborted by user"  nsresult: "0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)"  location: "JS frame :: resource:///components/nsPrompter.js :: openTabPrompt :: line 462"  data: no]"
[10:31:29] <Dooberry> does that mean anything to any of you?
[10:31:50] <Vorspire> chovy - in any case I usually dedicate a PHP script with CURL to fetch the data and load it with $.ajax - that nullifies the cross-domain problem, but the sanitation of the returned data is a pain in the ass
[10:32:00] <D3adM3at> Coouldn't you just set crossDomain to true?
[10:32:44] <Vorspire> Dooberry I wonder if you could get away with a confirm instead of alert
[10:32:59] <Dooberry> ooh interesting, i'll give it a try
[10:33:00] <Vorspire> var confirmed = confirm("message");
[10:33:12] <Vorspire> they will get ok/cancel and confirmed will result in true/false
[10:34:05] <Vorspire> D3adM3at yes but as chovy pointed out the target domain must allow it to be requested from another domain
[10:34:24] <Vorspire> that's why I just use a PHP file that outputs the raw HTML from cURL
[10:34:34] <Vorspire> and call it locally with $.ajax
[10:35:00] <iamcurio> anyone know of any good content sliders like this here: http://store.dolcegabbana.com/dolce_gabbana/search/Shirts/MEN/season/main/tskay/0E43D1BD/c/cat_1131/gender/U  - so it has the scroll bar and arrows
[10:35:12] <iamcurio> don't mind paying
[10:36:09] <D3adM3at> Vonspire: Got it.  I'm new to jQuery
[10:36:25] <Vorspire> iamcurio try this implementation of .slider? http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#side-scroll
[10:37:17] <iamcurio> Vorspire: would it be difficult to add the arrows also?
[10:37:40] <Vorspire> don't see why it would be too hard, you can just edit the markup and attach your own click handlers :)
[10:39:14] <grisun> What document events do I have to use so I can show a overlay saying "please wait…" and then what event do I have to use to unblock the overlay? (I'm trying to use  blockUI jquery plugin)
[10:39:36] <Vorspire> can you not just use a modal dialog in jqueryui?
[10:40:12] <grisun> Vorspire, sure that would probably work, too. How does that work or what do I have to google for?
[10:40:40] <Vorspire> grisun this may help :) http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal-confirmation
[10:40:55] <Vorspire> just use the Modal Message implementation
[10:42:08] <sodhi> Does anyone know how to copy the animation of .transfer but make it apply to the actual window the .transfer is applied to?
[10:42:12] <skyflyer> Is there anything wrong with adding attributes to an anchor tag like this   <a href="#" testid='23' call='yes'>test </a>
[10:42:56] <EpiphanyG> skyflyer: it's not valid HTML
[10:43:01] <eddiemonge> skyflyer: other than being non-standard and should instead be data-testid?
[10:43:05] <EpiphanyG> but you can do data-test-id="23" and data-call"yes"
[10:43:08] <Vorspire> skyflyer - custom attributes are supported by HTML5, anything below may have problems, it's best to prefix custom attributes with data- like "data-testid"
[10:43:28] <zerobyte> Some idea for call the content of a Modal Dialog from another source? i have many links calling Modal dialogs and i don't want to have all these code into the index.html
[10:43:51] <EpiphanyG> zerobyte: what is the other source?
[10:44:01] <zerobyte> php+html
[10:44:11] <moesti> hi, i use the uploadfile as identifier to can handle parallels uploadprogress. the problem is that the filenames can have types like / and other which a problem for htmltags. what can i do to handle this problem?
[10:44:16] <eddiemonge> zerobyte: why arent they in an external js file?
[10:44:52] <zerobyte> idk, i just want to know how to make it :P
[10:45:00] <skyflyer> any other way you might be able to specify more data or pass parameters from a link into a function ?
[10:45:04] <eddiemonge> how to make an external js file?
[10:45:25] <EpiphanyG> zerobyte you wrap it in a function and call the function
[10:45:26] <eddiemonge> skyflyer: those are two different issues. whats wrong with using data-xxxx?
[10:45:28] <zerobyte> how to make it work loading the content from de Modal D, from another source
[10:45:38] <grisun> Vorspire, thanks, but is it disappearing on its own once the page has been completely loaded?
[10:45:51] <zerobyte> EpiphanyG :o
[10:46:11] <EpiphanyG> maybe I misunderstand what you're trying to do :)
[10:46:20] <Vorspire> grisun you'd have to call .dialog("close") to close it when the event fires
[10:46:25] <eddiemonge> zerobyte: there are examples of how to do it in the docs
[10:47:02] <zerobyte> eddiemonge in the examples the Source code of the Modal Dialog is on the same .html
[10:47:23] <grisun> Vorspire, do you mean this way:   $(window).load(function() { .dialog("close"); });
[10:47:26] <grisun> ?
[10:48:43] <Vorspire> grisun, nope, you need an object reference to call .dialog on - $("#myDialog").dialog({ modal: true }); and to close: $("#myDialog").dialog("close");
[10:48:47] <eddiemonge> zerobyte: youre right. i was thinking of tabs. create a div, use .load() or something to get the content into it, then call $(yourdiv).dialog();
[10:49:02] <grisun> Vorspire, OH ok, thanks!
[10:49:07] <Vorspire> yw :)
[10:49:45] <necromancer> does anyone here use chosen.js?
[10:50:07] <skyflyer> Eddie, nothing wrong with us using data-xxx however it sounds like that isn't a valid html attr and might cause problems?
[10:50:08] <necromancer> having a problem where it's setting the same GET param for every new thing i select in the multiple select
[10:50:27] <Vorspire> skyflyer data-testid is valid
[10:50:52] <skyflyer> as html 5 or under?  so is data-testid valid for html 4?
[10:51:13] <moesti> is it possible to change a string to an hash?
[10:51:39] <Vorspire> well I've used it a lot before and it works, like here on the menu: http://runuo.vita-nex.com
[10:51:44] <EpiphanyG> it's html5 valid
[10:52:17] <Vorspire> moesti are you talking about md5 and sha1 encryption like in PHP?
[10:52:36] <EpiphanyG> but maybe it's time to switch to html5? :)
[10:52:52] <zerobyte> have jQuery something to Styling the FILE input tag?
[10:53:12] <Vorspire> FILE is styled different in all browsers
[10:53:18] <zerobyte> yeah
[10:53:24] <Vorspire> like Opera inserts a rounded background and extra button
[10:53:32] <eddiemonge> zerobyte: you cant style the file input tag. and CSS styles, not jquery
[10:53:43] <zerobyte> but i want to do something like www.sendspace.com
[10:53:48] <eddiemonge> zerobyte: you can do fake styling by styling a button over it but its hacky
[10:53:57] <jscheel> hey guys, I'm having a problem with dynamically-created droppables. Basically, I have droppables that are created on the fly when dragging a draggable, but my droppable's over and out events won't fire until I drag the draggable out of the side of my window and back again.
[10:53:57] <Lichurec> zerobyte: it's technically undoable unless you fake-create the input and set the parameters via JS
[10:53:57] <zerobyte> take a look of the file input
[10:54:04] <Lichurec> which also might be kindof tricky
[10:54:55] <Vorspire> you could just write your own file handler, I'm sure there was a way to active the File Explorer dialog using JavaScript
[10:55:14] <Vorspire> the same one that pops up when you click a FILE elem button
[10:55:27] <eddiemonge> zerobyte: i did and like i said, its a button styled over the input tag
[10:55:43] <zerobyte> ooooh
[10:56:04] <zerobyte> damn file tag -_-!
[10:57:08] <Vorspire> you could completely hide the FILE element and put it off the page, then use it as a guinea-pig for hooking events and triggering the dialog popup... theory not fact, but something I'm willing to check out :)
[10:57:21] <jscheel> the drop event still fires
[10:58:11] <Lichurec> In general - form elements were (by design) not supposed to be a part of the website but rather a system/browser elements placed "inside"â€¦ that idea of course changed in time, but old "habbits" stayed in engines xD
[10:58:21] <Lichurec> s/habbits/habits
[10:59:12] <Vorspire> yes and the File elem is by far one of the most inaccessible elements in the DOM, hands down
[10:59:39] <Lichurec> true, trueâ€¦
[11:00:13] <Vorspire> you'd think after the past 10 years of people complaining they'd have standardized it lol
[11:00:23] <eddiemonge> it is standard
[11:00:29] <eddiemonge> its more of a security issue
[11:00:41] <Lichurec> they'veâ€¦ or - they're
[11:00:45] <Vorspire> if it's so standard, then why is it different in every browser? :/
[11:00:56] <the_voice-> Alright I got a weird problem here
[11:01:15] <Lichurec> Vorspire: many reasons, including - again - a security issue
[11:01:20] <the_voice-> I am using ajaxForm to run some stuff
[11:01:28] <the_voice-> and it works fine if I use a submit button
[11:01:35] <Vorspire> the markup is standard, but the rendering isn't and I know about the security issues behind the subject :)
[11:02:10] <the_voice-> but if I use on change=this.form.submit() it does not call the ('#id').ajaxForm
[11:02:31] <the_voice-> anyone know how to fix that problem>
[11:02:42] <Lichurec> the "default" rendering will probably never be "standardized" across systems / browsersâ€¦ lety's just hope that there will be more options to change the defaults
[11:02:46] <the_voice-> the form submits without going through the jquery
[11:03:16] <brettster> does anyone here have access to ie7?
[11:03:22] <peterschmidler> I get the wrong height of the div after resizing the browser window. Anyone knows what's that about?
[11:03:45] <Vorspire> in what browser?
[11:04:18] <peterschmidler> Webkit
[11:04:50] <EpiphanyG> brett, did my suggestion from earlier not help?
[11:05:07] <NoiseEee> peterschmidler: and you've asked for a recalculation?
[11:05:21] <peterschmidler> When I make the window smaller the div gets higher because of line breaks, when I put the window size back to the original size, the div size stays at a higher value than initially...
[11:06:50] <seraphim> alright guys my Jquery doesnt post but it does set the right values :/
[11:07:35] <seraphim> http://pastebin.com/Ez1puphP <-- code so far
[11:07:35] <Murof> seraphim: doesnt post means, doesnt send or doesnt receive ?
[11:07:46] <the_voice-> anyone?
[11:07:51] <seraphim> it always goes to my else in the success:function
[11:07:55] <Vorspire> seraphim still having ajax trouble? got updated code to show us?
[11:07:55] <seraphim> uhmm one sec
[11:08:00] <Vorspire> ahh
[11:08:01] <Vorspire> nm
[11:08:13] <EpiphanyG> the_voice, can you show us some code?
[11:08:22] <seraphim> i changed it, to make it simpler
[11:08:31] <seraphim> but its still pretty much the same
[11:08:40] <Murof> well u dont have dataType
[11:09:02] <Murof> and ur setting post data plus I personally never used it like that, serialized
[11:09:02] <the_voice-> yup
[11:09:05] <Murof> only as object
[11:09:07] <the_voice-> I;ll put some in pastebin
[11:09:18] <Vorspire> well "data" always returns a string, and using type+value compoarison with === isn't going to help, try data === "0"
[11:09:31] <Murof> valid too
[11:09:34] <Vorspire> seraphim ^^^^
[11:10:27] <seraphim> alrighty
[11:11:29] <seraphim> this will never work XD
[11:11:52] <Vorspire> yes it will, if you just had used the json method I told you earlier it would be working ;)
[11:11:58] <seraphim> i tried that
[11:12:02] <seraphim> it was doing the same thing lol
[11:13:25] <g0th> hi
[11:13:27] <the_voice-> http://pastebin.com/GpE6ZnLC
[11:13:43] <g0th> is it possible to do linebreaks with .text(...) ?
[11:13:49] <seraphim> hrm
[11:13:57] <Vorspire> seraphim try adding the ajaxOption for dataType so it knows what to expect
[11:14:04] <nodestool> how do i get back all the results that show up from a search with jquery ui autocomplete?
[11:14:08] <Phrogz>  g0th: If your CSS is apply white-space:pre to the element you are modifying, then yes, via \n
[11:14:15] <Vorspire> g0th \n \r might work with .text, let me know if it does :)
[11:14:15] <the_voice-> I included(and tripled checked) jquery.forms.js
[11:14:16] <seraphim> mmk
[11:14:25] <the_voice-> now if I put a submit button it works as expected
[11:14:33] <Phrogz> Vorspire: If anything that'd be \r\n (CRLF) not LFCR. :)
[11:15:02] <Phrogz> g0th: Otherwise you'll need to insert <br> as appropriate (ugh) in html()
[11:15:45] <nodestool> nevermind autofocus: True is what i wanted
[11:16:26] <EpiphanyG> can you try with jQuery instead the_voice? $("#upload").submit() ?
[11:16:30] <Vorspire> Phrogs you'd think by the obviou space between the two I wrote that the context was they were separate...
[11:16:41] <the_voice-> okay
[11:16:41] <Vorspire> -s+z
[11:16:46] <thenior> Quick question: any reason why $('input[name=doorlength]').blur(function(){ myFunction()}); doesn't fire on blur?
[11:17:14] <NivenHuH> lol i was going to suggest to ask in #jquery and then i realized i'm in #jquery
[11:17:21] <NivenHuH> #needmorecoffee
[11:18:11] <the_voice-> Epiphany I am a bit confused
[11:18:12] <seraphim> rage
[11:18:16] <the_voice-> where should I put $("#upload").submit()?
[11:18:24] <the_voice-> in the onchange?
[11:18:25] <eddiemonge> thenior: because doorlength needs to be surrounded with double quotes
[11:18:28] <EpiphanyG> instead of this.form.submit();
[11:18:31] <the_voice-> okay
[11:18:49] <EpiphanyG> although replace " with ' as you're doing it in a onchange="" event
[11:19:07] <eddiemonge> always change onchange or other inline with non-inline
[11:19:42] <EpiphanyG> I don't even know if onchange fires on a file input, I don't work with file upload at all
[11:20:07] <the_voice-> nope :(
[11:20:09] <the_voice-> it does fire
[11:20:10] <thenior> eddiemonge: that's didn't change it :(
[11:20:15] <the_voice-> it submits the form
[11:20:21] <the_voice-> but it does not go through the jquery
[11:20:38] <the_voice-> the file uploads, but the jquery does not run
[11:21:18] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ the_voice-
[11:21:19] <bot-t> the_voice-, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[11:21:23] <bot-t> thenior, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:22:04] <Vorspire> also, doesn't using "input" instead of ":input" only select elements of type <input> not the others like <textarea> <select> etc?
[11:22:22] <EpiphanyG> sorry the_voice, I have no idea on this.
[11:22:34] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, et al: is Modernizr any good and has anybody used it? Advice?
[11:22:34] <the_voice-> :)
[11:22:36] <the_voice-> it's okay
[11:22:38] <the_voice-> thanks anyways
[11:22:50] <EpiphanyG> Whirl3d, it's great!
[11:23:00] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: its absolute garbage
[11:23:05] <eddiemonge> utterly worthless
[11:23:08] <EpiphanyG> I use it a lot
[11:23:09] <EpiphanyG> lol
[11:23:12] <eddiemonge> should never have been written
[11:23:22] <EpiphanyG> but what do you need it for?
[11:23:22] <seraphim> so
[11:23:25] <seraphim> I figured it out
[11:23:27] <seraphim> it does post
[11:23:29] <eddiemonge> ^^^ that was sarcasm
[11:23:29] <Vorspire> lol @ conflicting opinions
[11:23:40] <seraphim> but it seems the vars just arent storing in my php script
[11:23:41] <thenior> eddiemonge: Now I'm confused, works great here: http://jsfiddle.net/qknzH/
[11:23:52] <brettster> roooom?
[11:23:55] <thenior> but not on the actual site, http://www.raceramps.com/trcalc.aspx
[11:24:02] <eddiemonge> thenior: then its something else in your code. have you looked at the console in your code to see if there are error messages?
[11:24:10] <Whirl3d> A 3rd party vendor of a client of mine uses it and I am trying to integrate their system with my own and wondered if it was a good idea to learn it or not.
[11:24:13] <thenior> eddiemonge: yeah no errors returned
[11:25:06] <EpiphanyG> Whirl3d, there's not really much to learn with it
[11:25:31] <EpiphanyG> but you should definitely learn to utilise it.
[11:25:52] <eddiemonge> thenior: where is that function at?
[11:26:06] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: its pretty much the de facto standard now to use it
[11:26:16] <EpiphanyG> it's handy if you want to do cool stuff while still supporting older browsers
[11:26:22] <Whirl3d> Paul Irish is the lead developer? How could it not be great? What's the problem with it eddiemonge?
[11:26:40] <thenior> eddiemonge: http://thinkcloud.ly/rr.js, line 44
[11:26:44] <eddiemonge> thenior: it might also be because you have multiple versions of jquery loaded
[11:26:45] <EpiphanyG> he was being sarcastic Whirl ;)
[11:26:51] <Whirl3d> just saw that
[11:26:53] <Whirl3d> 8)
[11:26:54] <Whirl3d> lol
[11:26:57] <thenior> eddiemonge: oh geez I see that
[11:27:01] <EpiphanyG> :D
[11:27:02] <thenior> eddiemonge: let me try
[11:27:02] <Whirl3d> thanks for the opinions...
[11:27:06] <Vorspire> thenior http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/qknzH/1/ -using :input and name attribute matching (which doesn't require quotations as you were advised)

[11:28:15] <joell> hi all
[11:28:36] <joell> does anyone have experience with the simpledialog plugin for jqm?
[11:29:11] <eddiemonge> Vorspire: it does require it actually
[11:29:41] <eddiemonge> Vorspire: and it doesnt need the colon. in fact, thats a slower selector
[11:29:54] <Vorspire> then why does the example i posted work flawlessly? and why does the working widget i have on my site work flawlessly without quoting attribute values in the filter?
[11:29:58] <eddiemonge> thenior: ignore what Vorspire said to you
[11:30:16] <eddiemonge> Vorspire: the fiddle thenior posted also worked.
[11:30:24] <Vorspire> it requires quotations when the value has whitespace
[11:30:26] <Vorspire> yes it did
[11:30:46] <vincentspehner> Hello Folks
[11:31:00] <joell> The fixed footer (with a navbar) bouncing is driving me insane, any fix for this?
[11:31:03] <brettster> can anyone see ANYTHING wrong with this

[11:31:39] <vincentspehner> does anybody here already dealt with "jquery form builder plugin"?
[11:31:58] <vincentspehner> http://code.google.com/p/jquery-form-builder-plugin/
[11:32:06] <joell> Is this the right channel for jquerymobile help?
[11:32:10] <Vorspire> eddiemonge can't you see the blatant evidence that it works without quotations? why can't you accept that it's not *required*?
[11:32:16] <eddiemonge> joell: ask in #jquerymobile i know they are working on navbars and fixed-ed-ness. i think theres already a fix. what version are you using?
[11:32:30] <interopcop> EpiphanyG: It finds the id, but it still doesn't work.  My "unobtrusive javascript" js script is this:  https://gist.github.com/1705726
[11:32:34] <joell> eddiemonge, 1.0
[11:32:37] <eddiemonge> Vorspire: it is required. but you go ahead and use it without the quotes. when its broken you'll know why
[11:32:39] <vincentspehner> it's a really nice component, based on ui widget
[11:32:42] <seraphim> I WILL FIND IT!
[11:33:06] <vincentspehner> not badly written but doc sucks one the form structure side
[11:33:17] <vincentspehner> I offered to complete it
[11:33:27] <eddiemonge> joell: try using http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.min.js
[11:33:32] <P3t3> hi gents/ladies
[11:33:45] <vincentspehner> but I get stucked now
[11:33:56] <vincentspehner> anybody picking the challenge?
[11:33:59] <eddiemonge> interopcop: you need to wrap it in a doc.ready block
[11:34:05] <Vorspire> eddiemonge; ok, you must be right, even though the blatant evidence of it *not breaking* has been shown... but OK whatever.
[11:34:29] <interopcop> eddiemonge: ok.  hmm
[11:34:30] <eddiemonge> Vorspire: have you tried it in every browser? just trust me on this.
[11:34:54] <eddiemonge> Vorspire: i might even have been the one that bolded that sentence in the docs
[11:35:22] <Vorspire> if it breaks in IE, then no surprise but it hasn't and I've been doing it this way for years
[11:36:45] <the_voice-> got it working :)
[11:36:52] <interopcop> eddiemonge: good grief I feel so stoooopid
[11:36:54] <interopcop> thanks!
[11:37:03] <DukeDrake> what's best practice to register a keystroke globally?
[11:37:05] <P3t3> can anyone please help me with something ?
[11:37:06] <seraphim> so i noticed something
[11:37:11] <brettster> $(document).ready(function(){
[11:37:11] <brettster> 	$.fn.clearOnFocus = function() {
[11:37:11] <brettster> 		
[11:37:12] <brettster> 		function clearOnFocusFocus(event)
[11:37:12] <brettster> 		{
[11:37:14] <DukeDrake> e.g. someone pressing "esc"
[11:37:35] <eddiemonge> DukeDrake: bind it to the document
[11:37:57] <DukeDrake> eddiemonge: mhh ... $(document). ... ?
[11:37:59] <seraphim> when its "POST"ing my variables, it seems to take quite some time to show up even though it only shows like 100ms
[11:38:12] <eddiemonge> DukeDrake: or body
[11:38:28] <eddiemonge> theres one browser that didnt respect one of them
[11:38:40] <eddiemonge> ?paste @ brettster
[11:38:40] <bot-t> brettster, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:39:03] <DukeDrake> eddiemonge: yes, but bind ... what?
[11:39:03] <eddiemonge> seraphim: what shows 100ms? and what do you mean show up?
[11:39:17] <brettster> put it in pastie
[11:39:18] <brettster> http://pastie.org/3284178
[11:39:23] <snagnever> hey! i don't get how to work with .closest() :S like, i have: <section><articles><article id='article99'></article></articles><form/></section> how can i get to form by having the $('#article99') reference?
[11:39:59] <eddiemonge> Vorspire: hmm i cant find the blog post talking about this now
[11:40:34] <seraphim> when using firebug, to make sure everything is posting (which it says it does but it doesnt actually send) it takes about 10s for the post to show up and when it does it only says 100ms so there is some kinda delay somewhere
[11:40:44] <Vorspire> eddiemonge - I'll take your word for it on this one, you can't be wrong if you're going out of the wy to find docs on it
[11:40:50] <Lichurec> Vorspire: do you take under consideration that if something's "not breaking" != it's correct ?
[11:40:54] <fission6> is there a way with jquery to get a GET parameter in the url, and use it to make a RESTful api call?
[11:40:54] <eddiemonge> brettster: ugh that wasnt on the list of choices. whats your question though?
[11:41:22] <Vorspire> Lichurec I'm a .net dev - when things don't break, they must be working :P
[11:41:23] <eddiemonge> snagnever: it looks at the items parents until it finds it
[11:41:32] <Lichurec> especially that most browsers try to fix your errorsâ€¦
[11:41:53] <Lichurec> Vorspire: then you're not a "dev" ;]
[11:41:58] <eddiemonge> fission6: that would be normal js unless you want to find a plugin to parse url query params
[11:42:18] <Vorspire> You tell that to my gaming community Lichurec :)
[11:42:20] <eddiemonge> Vorspire: oh that explains it. im sorry, didnt realize you were a .net dev
[11:42:40] <eddiemonge> should have used smaller words
[11:42:43] <eddiemonge> ;) j/k
[11:42:46] <fission6> eddiemonge: ok
[11:42:49] <Lichurec> xD
[11:43:23] <eddiemonge> ?ask @ P3t3
[11:43:24] <bot-t> P3t3, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:43:35] <P3t3> ok cool
[11:43:39] <snagnever> eddiemonge yeah! i thought it would look throught sibling nodes too. Thanks! :D
[11:43:48] <Lichurec> K girls - time to leave the office and go homeâ€¦ be safe =]
[11:43:59] <eddiemonge> ?siblings @ snagnever
[11:44:00] <bot-t> snagnever, .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[11:44:09] <DEADB33F> What's the best way to call two (or more) ajax requests and have a function run only when they're all complete?
[11:44:53] <snagnever> in that case, the best would be $('#article99').closest('section').children('form')
[11:44:57] <P3t3> if i want to do a Jquery .load('file.php'); and that php file contains an include or even a couple of them - why will they not be loaded as well ?
[11:45:17] <NoiseEee> P3t3: uh, that happens on the backend
[11:45:22] <fission6> eddiemonge: for getJSON can i pass query string params?
[11:45:38] <P3t3> yeah i know
[11:45:45] <P3t3> i'm not a prof dev
[11:45:51] <P3t3> just figuring stuff out
[11:46:00] <sennahoj> anyone here using handlebars.js?
[11:46:03] <P3t3> i know you can load static html and it will load in a contaner div
[11:46:06] <brettster> eddiemonge ie7 suck
[11:46:09] <Vorspire> DEADB33F $.when( $.ajax(), $.ajax(), $.ajax() ).done( callback );
[11:46:10] <brettster> s
[11:46:14] <NoiseEee> P3t3: anyways your premise is wrong. as long as the backend can find the path to whats being included, etc, everything gets included
[11:46:19] <brettster> i can't get anything to work
[11:46:27] <P3t3> but as soon as you try to load a php file that already contains some includes - then the .load() will not load anything
[11:46:29] <brettster> iv fixed all my syntax errors...
[11:46:53] <NoiseEee> P3t3: time to look at any errors that php file is generating
[11:47:07] <eddiemonge> DEADB33F: set a flag for each and check those flags on the calls success or done params. or i think you can chain .whens()
[11:47:43] <eddiemonge> snagnever: try find instead of children unless the form is an immediate child
[11:48:03] <eddiemonge> P3t3: a php include?
[11:48:04] <P3t3> basically says it cannot find the path - whch i kinda get, but i cannot go change the paths on the php file I'm loading because then it will break the includes  - i'm probably not explaining myself crearly enough
[11:48:15] <DEADB33F> Yeah eddiemonge, that's the way I'm currently doing it. Didn't know about $.when though, so thx guys.
[11:48:17] <eddiemonge> DEADB33F: like vorspire siad
[11:48:38] <eddiemonge> brettster: whats not working?
[11:48:57] <eddiemonge> P3t3: try gong to that url directly in your browser
[11:49:22] <P3t3> ok wait lemme try and break it down
[11:50:11] <P3t3> i'm building this dashboard @ work right ( already working )
[11:50:23] <P3t3> it consists of 3 parts
[11:50:35] <fission6> how do i get scope through a namespace in an onload block like this? http://dpaste.org/6Fdqn/ for instance, i want to get acess to the var?
[11:50:44] <P3t3> each part has its OWN subfolder in relation to the root
[11:50:53] <NoiseEee> P3t3: you're doing a bad job on your backend by using relative paths to what you're including.  set_include_path() and ##php
[11:51:22] <NoiseEee> P3t3: you've got to fix your backend scripts and have them able to include dependencies regardless of where the file is called from
[11:51:23] <brettster> the images arent showing
[11:51:31] <eddiemonge> fission6: set your own custom namespace and then attach the var to that
[11:51:32] <brettster> cityofoneonta.org.s109594.gridserver.com
[11:51:36] <P3t3> so what should i be using
[11:51:48] <eddiemonge> brettster: which image?
[11:51:58] <P3t3> abs paths ?
[11:52:00] <NoiseEee> P3t3: use set_include_path() and put your include files in one place, or check out other options... either way, ##php
[11:52:02] <eddiemonge> P3t3: im not really sure if you are asking a jquery question or trying to troubleshoot your php
[11:52:07] <brettster> go to cityofoneonta.org.s109594.gridserver.com in firefox
[11:52:14] <brettster> then go to it in ie7
[11:52:16] <brettster> youll see
[11:52:19] <brettster> the whole animation
[11:52:20] <P3t3> no the problem comes in when i use JQ to load the php
[11:52:21] <brettster> isnt there
[11:52:27] <NoiseEee> P3t3: no, thats not the problem
[11:53:15] <fission6> eddiemonge: http://dpaste.org/V6NxS/
[11:53:25] <Lozzer> http://wamjelly.com/?ref=276601
[11:54:02] <eddiemonge> P3t3: if you go to the url that you are using to load the page, does that page work?
[11:54:11] <P3t3> yeah
[11:54:24] <Lozzer> Its work
[11:54:29] <Vorspire> fission, functions are not objects, (well, they are, but they don't have accessible members)
[11:54:30] <Lozzer> i need points
[11:54:37] <jeffsmykil> is there an easy way to turn an array into a comma seperated string?
[11:55:28] <eddiemonge> brettster: you seriously need to optimize your images
[11:55:41] <brettster> yeah
[11:55:50] <brettster> not really the problem right now though...
[11:55:54] <eddiemonge> P3t3: this is where examples or links would help
[11:56:00] <brettster> was aware of that
[11:56:11] <eddiemonge> brettster: it might be. it might be blocking other stuff from loading. its loading slow as heck for me
[11:56:14] <P3t3> eddie - this is not a public URL - I'm doing this at work
[11:56:15] <fission6> eddiemonge: did i not do it correct? http://dpaste.org/V6NxS/
[11:56:24] <eddiemonge> ?serializearray
[11:56:26] <P3t3> its an internal thing
[11:56:40] <brettster> dude
[11:56:48] <P3t3> may i try to explain in private ? Lotsa noise in the room
[11:57:02] <brettster> seriously?
[11:57:04] <eddiemonge> fission6: http://dpaste.org/fPfuF/
[11:57:06] <P3t3> or is that against the rules
[11:57:09] <brettster> that has no effect on the script.
[11:57:11] <brettster> like
[11:57:24] <brettster> it is well known .animate is funky with ie7
[11:57:31] <eddiemonge> P3t3: paste your js code then see ? pe
[11:57:32] <brettster> i just cant find a solution for my problem.
[11:58:02] <fission6> eddiemonge: okay that would work but i want everything inside the $(document) to be scoped by MYAPP
[11:58:04] <P3t3> ? pe
[11:58:11] <eddiemonge> brettster: well thats one of your problems....
[11:58:25] <eddiemonge> fission6: ok. and why cant you?
[11:58:30] <eddiemonge> ?pe
[11:58:39] <eddiemonge> oh i think i deleted that one
[11:58:43] <fission6> i have to explicitly put MYAPP in front of every var or function? eddiemonge
[11:58:46] <eddiemonge> or bot-t died
[11:58:56] <eddiemonge> P3t3: paste your code at jsfiddle.net
[11:59:06] <Vorspire> bot-t dies with temp01 :P
[11:59:09] <eddiemonge> fission6: yeah
[11:59:13] <fission6> i want to be able to do MYAPP.whatever, where whatever is anything inside basically my whoel app code
[11:59:20] <eddiemonge> i have my join/parts disabled
[11:59:26] <fission6> i thought there was anthoer more implicit way
[11:59:35] <eddiemonge> fission6: for what purpose?
[11:59:53] <eddiemonge> brettster: does it have to be ie7? can it be ie8?
[12:00:03] <brettster> works in ie8
[12:00:13] <brettster> client requires ie7+
[12:00:36] <eddiemonge> cant test it then. sorry
[12:01:08] <fission6> i just want to tuck everything under one globally exposed namespace eddiemonge
[12:01:13] <Vorspire> any reason why IE9 doesn't render text inside elements when using inline-block with the css hack-fix for IE 6/7?
[12:01:59] <eddiemonge> Vorspire: its because you need to quote it :D
[12:02:12] <eddiemonge> which hack-fix? link?
[12:02:25] <eddiemonge> fission6: for what?
[12:02:44] <Vorspire> the -moz-inline-stack: inline-block; zoom:1; *display: inline; fix
[12:03:26] <fission6> what do you mean eddiemonge
[12:03:37] <eddiemonge> Vorspire: never used that one
[12:03:50] <eddiemonge> fission6: i mean why do you want/think you need to, do that?
[12:04:06] <Vorspire> eddiemonge; I had o use it instead of floats to have a 2 column liquid layout
[12:04:43] <Vorspire> now the odd thing is, it applies fine to container elements, but when you apply it to elements without children it blows up
[12:05:02] <fission6> oh just for the sake of debugging and easily getting to values of things form the console, i want to be able to go through MYAPP and get the value of anything inside of what ive put in $(...)
[12:05:25] <eddiemonge> Vorspire: not sure. ask #css maybe or provide a link and which browser
[12:05:38] <Vorspire> np
[12:06:20] <fission6> does that make sens eddiemonge
[12:06:28] <eddiemonge> fission6: for easy debugging you console.log()
[12:07:21] <fission6> eddiemonge:
[12:07:31] <raj> is it okay to hide an element without putting it within a $(document).ready function?
[12:07:36] <fission6> I KNOW but how would i print a var inside my $(docment) without a namespace code
[12:07:49] <raj> just have  $('.fstart').hide();
[12:07:54] <raj> within a script
[12:08:07] <Vorspire> http://pandorauo.com/HighSeasBeta/ <-- the clocks on the right for example, should be single lines when not overflowing, another test can be found on the Features page - the features list title and the list itself
[12:08:09] <g0th> hi again
[12:08:12] <jeffsmykil> eddiemonge: what am I doing wrong?  http://pastebin.com/gx8XSSyt
[12:08:23] <g0th> it seems .text("\n") does not add a linebreak
[12:08:31] <g0th> and .text("         ") just adds one space
[12:08:37] <P3t3> http://jsfiddle.net/cPb5f/2/
[12:08:43] <g0th> is it possible to make an exact output?
[12:08:47] <P3t3> eddit - there you go
[12:08:53] <jeffsmykil> g0th: you could add a <div></div>
[12:09:08] <eddiemonge> raj: it might not get hiding depending on where that code is/fires
[12:09:08] <P3t3> but it does not incude the php files that are loaded dynamically
[12:09:12] <g0th> jeffsmykil: it is inside a div
[12:09:23] <g0th> I reference the div and do .text(text...)
[12:09:37] <jeffsmykil> yes inside the div add another div
[12:09:51] <eddiemonge> g0th: line breaks are meaning less. you need <br>
[12:10:01] <g0th> I want to display a text file
[12:10:02] <Vorspire> g0th what about escaping? "\\n"
[12:10:04] <jeffsmykil> no <br> isn't valid
[12:10:15] <Vorspire> <br /> oO
[12:10:22] <jeffsmykil> nor is that iirc
[12:10:28] <g0th> I dont want to display html
[12:10:41] <Vorspire> try "\\n"
[12:10:44] <g0th> ok
[12:10:45] <Vorspire> long shot
[12:11:05] <jeffsmykil> anyone know what im doing wrong?
[12:11:06] <jeffsmykil> http://pastebin.com/gx8XSSyt
[12:11:29] <g0th> then it puts "\n"
[12:11:30] <g0th> no linebreak
[12:11:37] <Vorspire> aww
[12:11:55] <Vorspire> hmmmmmm what about the unicode representation?
[12:11:59] <g0th> huh?
[12:13:16] <Vorspire> g0th; .text("\U+000D") ?
[12:13:43] <g0th> got it
[12:13:52] <g0th> .style.whiteSpace="pre"
[12:13:57] <g0th> solves everything
[12:14:17] <jeffsmykil> try this
[12:14:17] <jeffsmykil> &#x2028;

[12:17:12] <P3t3> eddie - make any sense of that ?
[12:17:21] <eddiemonge> fission6:
[12:17:23] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/L3RxL/
[12:17:23] <fission6> eddiemonge: here is maybe a clearer example http://dpaste.org/svwxG/, i want explicit direct access to anything inside my $(document) block http://dpaste.org/svwxG/
[12:17:57] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: you are trying to add to a new variable
[12:18:04] <fission6> eddiemonge: so there i sno way, i have to explicitly do myglobal.local
[12:18:56] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: ugh i hate pastebin http://pastebin.com/ZFqzGCna
[12:19:22] <eddiemonge> g0th: sounds more like you want to use <pre></pre>
[12:20:00] <jeffsmykil> eddiemonge: yeh i figured it out ty
[12:20:01] <eddiemonge> fission6: again, WHY do you want access to everything in a ready block?
[12:20:44] <g0th> eddiemonge: yes maybe, thx
[12:20:58] <fission6> ignore the ready block, i guess i am asking how do i expose everything through a Global namespace even if it has var whatever;
[12:21:44] <Chopps> hey guys, i have a select element that it is the result of an ajax request, and my jquery code doesnt work on it, can anyone help me fix it? this is the code i execute before and after the ajax call: http://pastebin.com/B2taPXEz line 4 doesnt work eventhough the code is correct
[12:21:44] <eddiemonge> fission6: ok then WHY do you want access to everything in a specific scope?
[12:22:08] <fission6> eddiemonge: for debugging, and quick access to do console.log(MYAPP.anythingiwant)
[12:22:27] <eddiemonge> Chopps: wheres the jquery in that?
[12:23:11] <eddiemonge> fission6: those arent valid reasons. you can add the console.logs in your code or look at the functions in breakpoints and other areas that already show all that info
[12:23:53] <fission6> i guess your saying there is no way
[12:24:37] <jeffsmykil> clipping last charachter off a string?
[12:24:38] <Chopps> eddiemonge lines 2 and 4
[12:26:14] <eddiemonge> fission6: no im saying you are trying to solve a problem wrongly
[12:26:55] <Whirl3d> The other day, Eviltwin was helping me with a script and I noticed that he created an element in a different way that I am familiar with. What is the best way to create a new DOM element?
[12:26:55] <eddiemonge> Chopps: have you looked at the outputted version of that code? im guessing thats where your problem lies
[12:27:17] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Totally depends on what you're trying to do
[12:28:01] <b1lly> is there a way to sort an array by its values numerically ASC
[12:28:08] <Eviltwin> b1lly: .sort()
[12:28:09] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin! Thanks for the reply. I want to add an anchor element to simulare an option element in a simulated Select element, lol
[12:28:20] <b1lly> Eviltwin: do i set that to a new variable?
[12:28:33] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: wha?? lol
[12:28:34] <Chopps> eddiemonge, yes i have, the id is correct and the option value matches the value i want to select from that elem
[12:28:43] <Eviltwin> b1lly: It changes the original array
[12:28:44] <eddiemonge> oh i get it know

[12:28:55] <eddiemonge> Eviltwin is my evil twin
[12:29:06] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: It doesn't make too big a difference how you do it
[12:29:10] <eddiemonge> Chopps: whats the outputted code look like?
[12:29:19] <Whirl3d> so, those are mighty big shoes to fill, eddiemonge...being the good twin and all..
[12:29:35] <Eviltwin> Except for things like $('<a href="'+url+'">hello</a>')
[12:29:48] <savid> Does jquery hav a simple way of extracting  the current url parameters into a simple object?
[12:29:49] <Eviltwin> vs $("<a>",{href:url,text:"hello"})
[12:30:12] <eddiemonge> savid: with plugins sure
[12:30:26] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, I had never seen the second version...which works better for my script. Thanks..
[12:31:00] <Chopps> eddiemonge: http://pastebin.com/yi2UF88v
[12:31:57] <eddiemonge> Chopps: i mean the outputted js
[12:32:19] <eddiemonge> Chopps: why not just paste everything outputted to jsfiddle.net
[12:33:16] <Chopps> eddiemonge i dont see the usage as the ajax request will not work, but i will do it, give me a minute to make the fiddle
[12:33:32] <b1lly> wshen you use sort, does it re-key them?
[12:33:36] <b1lly> or leave the same keys
[12:33:51] <b1lly> if it were an associative array
[12:35:40] <Vorspire> b1lly I wrote a small plugin to sort jQuery objects if that would be any help
[12:36:21] <eddiemonge> b1lly: it helps to read some documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[12:36:27] <jeffsmykil> any reason I wouldnt be able to send a click to an element from a jquery ui modal?
[12:36:56] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: what do you mean?
[12:37:08] <jeffsmykil> I have this in my code
[12:37:09] <jeffsmykil> $("#MainContent_GoButton").click();
[12:37:16] <jeffsmykil> when its run from the dialog it doesnt work
[12:37:20] <jeffsmykil> but in the console it does
[12:38:06] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: is the content in the dialog in an iframe? how are you running the script? does console.log( $("#MainContent_GoButton").length ); return 1 if you put it right before that call?
[12:38:19] <Vorspire> b1lly assoc arrays are sorted by key, indexed arrays are also sorted by key - you can also provide a comparison function for .sort to override it, much like jQuery has .filter
[12:38:22] <jeffsmykil> its not in an iframe
[12:39:59] <Vorspire> .click() - does that fire the event? thought you had to use .trigger?
[12:40:12] <jeffsmykil> click works in the console
[12:40:17] <eddiemonge> Vorspire: nope. empty .click() calls trigger('click')
[12:40:24] <Vorspire> ahh good to know
[12:40:26] <Vorspire> ty
[12:40:32] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: you didnt answer the rest of my questions
[12:40:39] <eddiemonge> Vorspire: trigger is slightly faster though
[12:40:45] <eddiemonge> a few less function calls
[12:41:35] <jeffsmykil> eddiemonge: hrm it didn't even break for some reasonn
[12:42:50] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: how are you running the script?
[12:43:00] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: does console.log( $("#MainContent_GoButton").length ); return 1 if you put it right before that call?
[12:44:24] <jeffsmykil> yeah it returns 1
[12:44:55] <eddiemonge> did you bind anything to $("#MainContent_GoButton")'s click event?
[12:45:07] <jeffsmykil> I don't think so....
[12:45:10] * jeffsmykil checks
[12:46:08] <jeffsmykil> it does not appear that way
[12:46:19] <raj> eddiemonge, what's the solution?
[12:46:39] <raj> cuz if I put it in $(document).ready, it shows momentarily
[12:46:41] <b1lly> i want to sort my array by value but not change the keys
[12:47:08] <jeffsmykil> maybe there is an onclose function in ui that i didnt se
[12:47:19] <Vorspire> b1lly, look at array.push for that methd of sorting
[12:47:42] <jeffsmykil> ah there is a before close
[12:47:49] <eddiemonge> raj: huh?
[12:48:02] <jeffsmykil> but that seems to refer to any button being clicked
[12:48:07] <chee> what's the solution
[12:48:23] <eddiemonge> b1lly: is it a name-value array?
[12:48:44] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: then what are you trying to trigger with .click()?
[12:48:55] <jeffsmykil> page submission
[12:49:03] <lsone> when i am doing a parseXML that is called in ajax, how can i get my parseXML to accept an empty array as an argument as well as the xml?
[12:49:11] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: for a form?
[12:49:15] <b1lly> eddiemonge: right now its just a index array (0,1,2,3,4,5)
[12:49:24] <intellilogic> var foo = $(this).parent('div');  $('foo [name="rack_id"]').val()  <- How to?
[12:49:27] <jeffsmykil> yeah but the form just puts the value into an invisible form on the main pahe
[12:49:30] <eddiemonge> b1lly: then sort is what you want
[12:49:31] <b1lly> but i will change it to a associative array for keys if i need to
[12:49:32] <jeffsmykil> the main page that submits
[12:49:32] <raj> eddiemonge, regarding $('.fstart').hide();
[12:49:37] <b1lly> the problem is
[12:49:53] <raj> if I keep that in the $(document).ready function, it shows momentarily
[12:50:02] <b1lly> the value is the sort order and the key is the element id
[12:50:04] <eddiemonge> intellilogic: foo.find('[name="rack_id"]').val()
[12:50:08] <Jon47> is there a way to bind an event handler such that it executes before a handler that was bound previously?
[12:50:14] <raj> so I want it hidden immediately after the element is created
[12:50:16] <intellilogic> eddiemonge thanks
[12:50:17] <MoTiOnXml> "hello, this is dog"
[12:50:21] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: then call.submit() on the form
[12:50:36] <iamcurio> anyone know what i would need to change on here to make it load the slider straight away. i only need one slider ya seeâ€¦.  http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/SliderGallery/
[12:50:43] <eddiemonge> raj: http://paulirish.com/2009/avoiding-the-fouc-v3/
[12:50:52] <jeffsmykil> yeah eddiemonge but click should work
[12:51:05] <eddiemonge> b1lly: paste an example to jsfiddle.net
[12:51:07] <Chopps> eddiemonge, sorry it took me so long, but here it is the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/V2kVv/
[12:51:23] <eddiemonge> Jon47: unbind then rebind
[12:51:35] <eddiemonge> raj: why not hide it before its created
[12:51:49] <raj> eddiemonge, cuz non-js users I'd have to worry about
[12:51:55] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: no, because you havent bound anything to click
[12:52:11] <eddiemonge> raj: are you creating the element in js?
[12:52:17] <raj> no
[12:52:41] <chee> ?
[12:52:41] <Jon47> eddiemonge - do you know how to get the previous handler functions?
[12:52:55] <chee> raj: set it to display:none; in the css then..?
[12:53:07] <raj> chee, how does that help non-js users
[12:53:32] <chee> you want the element to be hidden
[12:53:46] <raj> only for js, cuz it's prettier that way
[12:53:47] <chee> and you aren't creating the element with js
[12:53:50] <chee> oh i see
[12:53:53] <chee> then use modernizr
[12:54:00] <chee> http://modernizr.com
[12:54:02] <chee> or a similar method
[12:54:11] <chee> and set <html class="no-js"> by default
[12:54:16] <Vorspire> raj; use <noscript> ?
[12:54:38] <chee> then style it in the css "html.no-js .my-sexy-button { display:block; }"
[12:54:47] <eddiemonge> Chopps: im not sure what you want: http://jsfiddle.net/V2kVv/2/
[12:55:02] <eddiemonge> raj: so you arent creating an element then
[12:55:04] <chee> raj: the .no-js will be removed when the javascript runs, so it'll only be present for javascriptless users
[12:55:50] <Chopps> thats what i want eddiemonge, but it doesnt work on the element that i got back from the ajax request
[12:56:20] <Chopps> eddiemonge, its like the response select element doesnt exists in the dom tree
[12:56:20] <eddiemonge> Jon47: .data("events") maybe or something like that. cant remember off the top of my head. ajpiano or someone else might know
[12:56:25] <b1lly> eddiemonge: here is what my array looks like... the value is the order in which they need to be displayed so i want to sort them by the order numerically, but i want to keep the array key the same http://jsfiddle.net/xbTYa/
[12:56:44] <eddiemonge> Chopps: why not do it all in jquery?
[12:57:09] <Chopps> eddiemonge, the ajax part?
[12:57:24] <eddiemonge> b1lly: why do you want to keep the key the same?
[12:57:57] <eddiemonge> Chopps: all of it. the response select might not exist in the dom tree until you add it
[12:58:26] <Jon47> eddiemonge - thank you sir!  i'll research the rest, i appreciate the help
[12:58:50] <Whirl3d> what is the jquery equivalent of Array.splice ?
[12:58:51] <b1lly> eddiemonge: because i need to know that bin4 = 1
[12:58:57] <b1lly> because thats the order of the elements
[12:59:02] <eddiemonge> Chopps: why are you returning the whole select? why not append the items?
[12:59:11] <b1lly> bin4 gets displayed first, then bin1, than bin2, etc
[12:59:25] <Chopps> eddiemonge, if u checked the code i had commented on the fiddle, i do add it to an element with innerHTML
[12:59:49] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: for what?
[13:00:04] <eddiemonge> b1lly: so what does they key matter?
[13:00:20] <Chopps> eddiemonge, cause i dont know how to, i think im going to try to do it all with jquery, just need to find good examples to learn
[13:00:28] <eddiemonge> Chopps: you replace the existing select right? the whole thing?
[13:00:39] <Chopps> eddiemonge, i do
[13:01:26] <b1lly> eddiemonge: the key defines the element that is positioned
[13:01:28] <b1lly> by the value
[13:01:31] <b1lly> so if i got rid of the keys
[13:01:37] <b1lly> how would i know bin1 = 5
[13:01:39] <eddiemonge> Chopps: this might help: http://jsfiddle.net/V2kVv/3/
[13:01:40] <raj> any way to do `if javascript, style="display:hidden"` inline?
[13:02:02] <Whirl3d> eddiemonge, I think I just figured it out. I'd just use .before or .after to insert an element to a specific location in the jquery array-like object.
[13:02:02] <eddiemonge> Chopps: you need to set the value after you replace the content, in the same function
[13:02:30] <ghostbar> anyone knows how to change the tab loaded by default with twitter-bootstrap tabs plugin?
[13:02:40] <eddiemonge> b1lly: you arent really making a whole lot of sense. is the key bin1 or 5? make the actual array in jsfiddle
[13:03:07] <ghostbar> don't know why making $( selection ).click() doesn't load's it, btw
[13:03:11] <eddiemonge> raj:  dont do inline and like everyone else said, set <html class="no-js"> and then remove the no-js in js to see if js is enabled
[13:03:15] <Chopps> thanks eddiemonge, im going to try and implement that on my code
[13:03:59] <eddiemonge> ghostbar: is twitter's bootstrap using jqueryui?
[13:04:09] <eddiemonge> raj:  look at html5boilerplate
[13:06:40] <b1lly> eddiemonge: the key is bin5
[13:06:43] <b1lly> the value is 1
[13:07:07] <peterschmidler> I am getting different values for $("#content").height() on page load and after a reload. How can that be?
[13:07:35] <khmer> peterschmidler: does #content contain an image or other resource that may change in dimensions once assets have loaded?
[13:07:38] <b1lly> the value is the position of the bin for when i place them on the DOM (the value represents the order of which they get displayed)
[13:07:42] <anli__> Is there a way to listen on a divs resize?
[13:07:52] <peterschmidler> khmer: an image
[13:07:54] <b1lly> so i'm trying to sort by the VALUE, but keep the keys. because the key is used to define the element
[13:08:11] <anli__> oh, its just resize, it seems
[13:09:09] <eddiemonge> b1lly: ok then you have a name-value array (object) and not an auto-incremented array. in that case, sort will not work
[13:09:11] <peterschmidler> khmer: How can I wait until image is loaded?
[13:09:33] <skyflyer> question. I'm doing a .ajax call that returns a data set.  on sucess i'm population a dropdown menue.  onChange of the dropdown, I need to repopulate it with a filter data set.  Whats the best way to be able to get access back to that original data set for my drop down?  So that I don't make an ajax call everytime someone selects something from the dropdodwn?
[13:09:34] <khmer> peterschmidler: $(window).load()
[13:09:41] <eddiemonge> peterschmidler: add it to the images load event
[13:09:54] <khmer> skyflyer: pop the result in the object's data
[13:10:10] <raj> eddiemonge, why's that help?
[13:10:14] <raj> (boilerplate)
[13:10:14] <khmer> skyflyer: i mean the element's data
[13:10:16] <eddiemonge> skyflyer: store it to a variable in your namespace
[13:10:37] <eddiemonge> raj: to see how millions of other developers are doing what you want to be done
[13:10:51] <acidjazz> $('#step').val(data.step*1+1); this is a <select> where i know the value im passing (a number) is one of the options.. instead of selecting that option though it just defaults to the 1st option.  am i not doing this right?
[13:11:18] <raj> preventing flash of unstyled content?
[13:12:04] <chee> raj: styling things specifically for people without javascript, and differently than those with javascript
[13:12:16] <chee> that
[13:12:26] <khmer> raj: html5boilerplate includes Modernizr, which adds information about the user agent in the form of classes to the html tag
[13:12:39] <khmer> raj: in the absence of JS, the html tag will have the class "nojs"
[13:12:54] <khmer> raj: then you can write CSS specifically for the no-js users
[13:13:17] <chee> i feel like i'm watching groundhog day
[13:13:39] <ghostbar> eddiemonge: no, is not using jquery-ui, and I know this is about jquery but maybe someone is using jquery+twitter-bootstrap-js and had the same issue or knows what to do
[13:13:45] <eddiemonge> acidjazz: can you paste a demo of what you have at jsfiddle.net?
[13:14:16] <eddiemonge> chee which is everyday here
[13:14:39] <eddiemonge> ghostbar: you should look at the bs-js and see if there is a method for closing
[13:14:43] <Chopps> thank you so much eddiemonge, i was able to fix the issue with your awesome suggestion, thanks again
[13:15:03] <eddiemonge> Chopps: no problem. at least i could help *1* person today
[13:15:17] <chee> :)
[13:16:32] <acidjazz> eddiemonge: i figured it out .. my code was fine :/
[13:16:34] <acidjazz> eddiemonge: thanks though
[13:16:41] <acidjazz> eddiemonge: i had some code above that was clearing every .val()
[13:16:51] <ghostbar> I call .click() on the selector '.tabs .active .active a', that returns me(the selector) <a href='#addthis'>anything</a>, where I want to make click. And since is supposed it changes tabs on click that should change it, but it doesn't. And i'm positive that the tabs got loaded before calling .click()
[13:19:16] <ghostbar> eddiemonge: there's no method, just clicking, that's why I tried with $().click()
[13:20:56] <skyflyer> store it like this?    $.timeline.jsondata = data;
[13:21:41] <Whirl3d> I need to create four different sort methods for anchor elements: sortbyIndex, sortbyHref, sortbyTitle, and sortbyText. What's the best way to approach this?
[13:25:37] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: what do you mean sort methods?
[13:25:51] <johnkpaul> you have a list of all of the elements?
[13:26:11] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Are they all part of the same parent?
[13:26:24] <Whirl3d> yes.
[13:26:25] <Eviltwin> Do they represent all of the children of the same parent?
[13:26:31] <Whirl3d> yes.
[13:26:32] <eddiemonge> ghostbar: that is some shitty doc and code but if you want to do it the trigger way $('.tabs').find('a[href="#profile"]').trigger('click');
[13:26:53] <Eviltwin> Then you can do something like $("#parent").children().sort(function(a,b) { ... }).appendTo("#parent");
[13:26:59] <eddiemonge> ghostbar: i would need a link to your actual code to troubleshoot why that wouldnt work
[13:27:13] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, thanks for the reply. I do have the list of elements...I'm simulating a select field...basically
[13:27:18] <Eviltwin> Where you compare the two children a and b
[13:27:37] <johnkpaul> a select field that you have to reorder? Whirl3d
[13:27:44] <eddiemonge> skyflyer: make your own namespace: var SKYFLYER = {}; SKYFLYER.jsondata = data;
[13:28:08] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, yes. It's more like an autocomplete suggest field...
[13:28:42] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, thanks for the reply. I'll try it
[13:28:51] <eddiemonge> isnt creating a sort function one of those interview questions people always ask?
[13:29:10] <johnkpaul> yeah, Eviltwin's suggestion is what I'd suggest, mayve have a few different sort functions setup and just reorder your array when you need to
[13:29:16] <dabear> it's quite easy actually
[13:29:22] * Whirl3d hasn't interviewed in 20 years...
[13:29:30] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/YQTS8/
[13:29:41] <dabear> you can use $(".foo").sort( function(ela, elb){  return somecondition})
[13:29:56] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/YQTS8/
[13:29:57] <dabear> and then replaceWith on the original collection
[13:30:34] <b1lly> I'm like... bah_array = [];   bah_array.push('value');       and than when I alert bah_array; it returns value,value,value; which is right but when I try to use the $.inArray() it returns -1 constantly...if i create the array manually like bah_array = [value,value,value]; and use $.inArray it returns properly
[13:30:36] <dabear> just like Eviltwin showed above ^^
[13:31:09] <dabear> ?inarray
[13:31:09] <bot-t> jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/

[13:32:52] <b1lly> dabear: I figured it out
[13:33:02] <b1lly> when i was using array.push I needed to parseInt() the value that i was adding
[13:37:15] <otiuk> with a list of radio buttons is it possible to grab them by the name attribute instead of assigning a class or id to them?
[13:37:57] <aghouseh> otiuk: $('input[name="awesome"]');
[13:38:07] <otiuk> oh sweet
[13:38:30] <otiuk> i figured there was a way.. just couldn't seem to use the right words in my search glad you understood me
[13:38:41] <Eviltwin> otiuk: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[13:39:03] <otiuk> thanks i will read through that
[13:43:01] <fourcolors> Hey I'm trying to work with jQuery Autocomplete and JSON data but am confused on how it  should be working
[13:43:13] <fourcolors> I have JSON data of a bunch of user you can search through
[13:44:23] <fourcolors> this is what my autocomplete looks like
[13:44:24] <fourcolors> http://pastie.org/3284984
[13:44:33] <fourcolors> it dosn't seem to be working
[13:44:55] <Whirl3d> What is NOT_FOUND_ERR: DOM exception 8?    http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/YQTS8/8/
[13:45:15] <fourcolors> Should I need to tell autocomplete what to be searching in my JSON ?
[13:45:19] <fourcolors> Im confused
[13:46:01] <kborchers> fourcolors: autocomplete expects certain items to be in your json, if you want to use a custom set of json data, check out http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data

[13:49:29] <DukeDrake> hi
[13:49:41] <DukeDrake> how can I make an image follow the mouse cursor?
[13:49:49] <eddiemonge> eww
[13:50:01] <eddiemonge> thats annoying
[13:50:08] <DukeDrake> eddiemonge: ?
[13:50:23] <DukeDrake> it's meant for an editor ...
[13:51:23] <eddiemonge> and...?
[13:51:24] <Eviltwin> $(window).mousemove(function(e){$("#img").css({"position":"absolute","left":e.pageX,"top":e.pageY})});
[13:51:36] <Eviltwin> There's your start
[13:52:13] <obelich> hiyas
[13:52:23] <DukeDrake> Eviltwin: thanx
[13:52:36] <fourcolors> kborchers: ok so autocomplete doesn't support a "dataType" I guess? so i need to be using "source:" to do my manipulations of the data with something like $.map ?
[13:53:03] <obelich> sorry my english is bad but have a problem try to make a submit function on out from one div here are the code http://pastebin.com/NY7616Bj anyone no busy can help please ^_^
[13:54:01] <eddiemonge> obelich: you want to submit a form when you mouse out of a div?
[13:54:05] <DukeDrake> should I prefer e.clientY or e.pageY ?
[13:54:21] <obelich> eddiemonge, yes
[13:54:26] <kborchers> fourcolors: yeah, use an ajax request in source to get your data and in the success callback, use map to map the data to the expected label and value
[13:55:15] <obelich> eddiemonge, but in the page have multiple forms using ajax for that i want to submit to one particular form
[13:55:17] <eddiemonge> obelich: not very user friendly: http://jsfiddle.net/p8UC4/
[13:55:55] <eddiemonge> kborchers: oh good, someone else who can answer questions. that mean i can sign off
[13:56:22] <kborchers> eddiemonge: heh, i'm out in about 30 minutes :P
[13:56:22] <obelich> eddiemonge, testing :)
[13:58:12] <fourcolors> kborchers: ok thanks thats helpful to know. I seem to be missing the documentation that says you need a "label" and "value" attribute
[13:58:25] <fourcolors> kborchers: but get it now
[13:58:57] <Whirl3d> to attach a collection of previously detached elements, you would use $.append, right?
[13:59:00] <kborchers> cool, yeah i don't think the custom data was documented well but viewing the source on those examples should be pretty helpful
[13:59:33] <kedarm> Should $("tbody").append("<tr> ...</tr>") be the way to add a new row to the only table/tbody I have in a document?
[13:59:55] <eddiemonge> kedarm: yes, if tbody exists
[14:00:05] <obelich> eddiemonge, buuua dont make the submit :(
[14:00:22] <kedarm> eddiemonge: thanks, somehow, it does not immediately show up.
[14:04:01] <magcius> Is there a way to combine two jQuery objects?
[14:04:31] <magcius> I tried $([$('a'), $('b')]), but that didn't quite work
[14:04:39] <NoiseEee> magcius: what are you trying to do
[14:04:41] <Eviltwin> ?.add @ magcius
[14:04:42] <bot-t> magcius, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[14:05:17] <magcius> Aha, thanks!
[14:06:06] <eddiemonge> obelich: it should. if it doesnt then you that element is not the form or something else is wrong in your code
[14:06:15] <magcius> So $().add([$('a'), $('b')]) should work
[14:06:25] <magcius> NoiseEee, be right back, hold on a minute
[14:06:26] <Vorspire> the behaviour of add is funny though isn't it? like say if you do var obj = $("#div1").add("#div2"); obj will still return only #div1 - or has that been fixed? thanks t o that, I always use obj.push($("#div2"));
[14:07:37] <kedarm> When debugging Ajax program, is there a way in Chromium browser to put a breakpoint at the first JavaScript line browser receives from the server?
[14:07:47] <Phrogz> Vorspire: That is not the current behavior.
[14:07:58] <Eviltwin> ?ftj @ kedarm
[14:07:58] <bot-t> kedarm, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[14:08:08] <Vorspire> Phrogs; great, think that was the behaviour in 1.4.2 last time I used it
[14:08:18] <Phrogz> This is 1.7.1; no idea when/if it changed.
[14:08:31] <Vorspire> sorry I keep typing your name wrong :)
[14:09:10] <Vorspire> yeah 1.4.2 I think had that issue, been using .push since then to add to the stack
[14:09:30] <Vorspire> well if .add works properly now that's great
[14:10:58] <kedarm> Eviltwin: Thanks!
[14:13:47] <Vorspire> Phrogz - could you explain ui-helper-clearfix and maybe tell me of the best case scenario of when it might be needed? I have a funny feeling I need to apply it to some containers for some reason after looking at jqueryUI source codes
[14:14:12] <Vorspire> or just point me at some good docs if any :P I can't find anything on jqueryui that really explains it properly
[14:14:37] <Eviltwin> Do you know what a clearfix is?
[14:14:53] <Vorspire> yes it's for floated elements
[14:14:53] <Phrogz> Sorry, I don't know what that is. Best guess is that it's related to causing a container to clear past the end of floated content.
[14:15:07] <Phrogz> http://phrogz.net/CSS/understandingfloats.html
[14:15:13] <Eviltwin> Yes
[14:15:20] <Eviltwin> Read about clearfixes in general first
[14:15:29] <Vorspire> it may be the key to me fixing IE9's lack of inline-block support
[14:15:38] <Phrogz> Er: http://phrogz.net/CSS/understandingfloats.html#incontainers
[14:16:11] <Vorspire> yeah I actually hate using floats, I'm using the CSS hack for IE 6/7 for inline-block - but IE9 has serious rendering issues for it :)
[14:16:12] <Vorspire> ty guys
[14:16:36] <magcius> NoiseEee, basically, I have a bunch of data that I want to turn into HTML elements.
[14:16:47] <chee> floats are useful when the content needs to be floated
[14:16:55] <magcius> NoiseEee, I'm doing the mapping by a set of functions, and the functions return a jQuery object.
[14:17:11] <Vorspire> yeah, in this case I'm just trying to display a UL inline-block'd
[14:17:23] <magcius> NoiseEee, I was doing $($.map(data, function(thing) { ... })); before, but that didn't work.
[14:17:47] <magcius> I guess $().add($.map(data, function(thing) { ... })); should work, but it still looks awkward
[14:18:32] <magcius> Actually, no it won't... darn.
[14:18:39] <Vorspire> shouldn't empty $() be done like $([]) ? or is that another old-skool work-around from 1.4.2? >_>
[14:19:16] <magcius> here's an example: https://gist.github.com/1707159
[14:19:33] <magcius> whoops, I didn't mean to post the entire file, but there, you get to see all my code
[14:20:20] <magcius> the problem is that $row is a jQuery object, and I can't give .add() an array of jQuery objects.
[14:24:06] <fourcolors> I'm working with jQuery autocomplete and I have something that looks like this http://pastie.org/3285248 it doesn't seem to do any type of autocomplting but the ajax request seem to be happening just fine
[14:24:16] <magcius> Eviltwin, would you know what's happening here?
[14:24:21] <fourcolors> am I missing something here
[14:24:26] <magcius> Well, we all know what's happening.
[14:24:35] <fourcolors> shouldn't it be working? Nothing seem to show up when I type
[14:24:55] <Eviltwin> magcius: No, you can't give it an array of jQuery objects
[14:25:07] <johnkpaul> magcius: the problem is that $().add doesn't take multiple arguments?
[14:25:11] <Eviltwin> How are you ending up with an array of jQuery objects?
[14:25:17] <magcius> Eviltwin, see my gist above.
[14:25:18] <magcius> $.map
[14:25:31] <koltroll> Not a jqery user normally, but thought I'd play around some with it. Something really basic. Trying to get an alert() to show up when I press a <button id="my_button">. $('#my_button').click(function(){ alert('Yay!');}) -- Am I missing something fundamental here? Can it be that I'm loading jquery.min.js from googleapis rather than then full version?
[14:25:35] <danzik17> magcius: You can add in .get() after the map - that'll return a native array
[14:25:48] <fourcolors> Ok looks like my map wasn't accessing the right object.. opps
[14:25:50] <someprimetime> what is the best way to refactor this? specifically the 2 ajax calls I'm doing: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/3LhkZ/
[14:25:58] <addisonj> speaking of autoComplete, anyone know of a simple autocomplete plug that is easily extensible and doesn't require me to get JQuery UI?
[14:26:13] <magcius> danzik17, what? $.map returns an Array, not a jQuery object
[14:26:37] <danzik17> magcius: eh, don't listen to me.  IRC + no sleep = fail.
[14:26:51] <NoiseEee> magcius: not sure i follow, but personally if you're just trying to send back html/elements, i'd use an array of strings for markup, and then just return  something like: var p = $('<element>').update(joinedArray)
[14:27:08] <draginx1> Is there a way to make a mouseout on a selector liek #about_me_container, #menu-item-25, #about_me all at once?
[14:27:11] <NoiseEee> imho you have way too much .append going on magcius
[14:27:12] <magcius> Here's my code: https://gist.github.com/1707159
[14:27:14] <draginx1> meaning if I mouseout of all of those containers?
[14:27:40] <magcius> NoiseEee, I'm constructing DOM elements. There is no HTML coming back from the server.
[14:27:56] <lsone> why would .push or just + "" not work when filling an array defined outside of a function?
[14:28:02] <Eviltwin> magcius: It should automatically flatten one layer of arrays
[14:28:11] <magcius> Eviltwin, "it" being?
[14:28:25] <Eviltwin> magcius: http://jsfiddle.net/wZZd4/
[14:28:42] <koltroll> bah I'm silly. I clearly need to use some sort of ondomready-event.
[14:28:55] <magcius> Eviltwin, I'm returning jQuery objects, not Arrays.
[14:29:16] <Eviltwin> Guess how jQuery objects are represented
[14:29:25] <magcius> (Yes, jQuery objects are arrays internally, but I'm not sure if $.map cares)
[14:29:33] <lsone> i have a var newArray = new Array(); defined, and when i .push or + "" into it, from inside a function, it isn't working
[14:30:17] <magcius> -- "$(document) instanceof Array"
[14:30:18] <magcius> False
[14:30:52] <Eviltwin> Correct
[14:31:04] <Eviltwin> It's called "array-like" or "arrayish"
[14:31:16] <Eviltwin> Use .get()
[14:31:43] <NoiseEee> magcius: maybe i'm missing the big picture, but again... too much .append.   http://jsfiddle.net/BN2mz/
[14:31:46] <Eviltwin> Instead of "return $row" "return $row.get()"
[14:31:55] <Eviltwin> Or "return $row[0]" in this case
[14:32:08] <Eviltwin> And use $(...) instead of $().add(...)
[14:32:35] <Eviltwin> Or just the array if you can operate on that
[14:36:49] <lsone> ok so i think i know the problem, the array isn't actually 'global', i have to reference it, but i can't get my ajax call to reference the array
[14:38:28] <lsone> is there any way to pass variables into the success function of an ajax call?
[14:40:18] <DJTrey> variables from where?
[14:40:31] <lsone> jeez, this would actually have to go pretty deep.
[14:41:28] <lsone> i'm trying to get an array declared at <script> level, all the way into document.ready, into my getXML function, into the 'success' function from the ajax GET
[14:41:53] <DJTrey> ehhh
[14:41:56] <DJTrey> over my head
[14:41:59] <lsone> lol
[14:42:13] <DJTrey> i know i can create a variable and do stuff with it inside my success
[14:42:21] <DJTrey> but not all the things you said
[14:42:36] <lsone> all the code inside all the functions is running, just none of it is actually updating the array once it's outside
[14:43:09] <lsone> the array is working locally when i need it to work globally, or find a way to reference it in functions that don't seem to want to let it be referenced
[14:43:44] <DJTrey> so on the success it's losing items in the array?
[14:45:59] <lsone> yea, pretty much
[14:57:09] <nik_jv> Halol
[14:57:20] <nik_jv> i have a dropmenu that appears when I click on a button
[14:57:39] <nik_jv> the problem is since it's not triggered by hover, what is a good way to bind 'hiding' the menu?
[14:57:52] <nik_jv> normally this would be the equivalent to mouseout, but since this is triggered by hover, should i bind a click event to hide the menu to everything else on the page?
[14:59:42] <tw2113> unbind?
[14:59:57] <tw2113> *shrug*
[15:02:38] <ProLoser|Work> would it be safe to do something like $('*:not(#someEl)') or is that just gonna cause too much overhead?
[15:03:04] <natrixnatrix89> hi guys.. mostly when I see websites with CMS, where you can edit data directly, they have made it in a way that they have elements, and on click event the element is replaced with input type=text, user edits text, and when he blurs, the object is replaced again with the appropriate element..
[15:03:04] <natrixnatrix89> I'm just wondering why is this needed? Because now I'm just thinking. I could just have lot's of inputs from the beginning.. and just apply different styles to them.. what's the drawback for this approach?
[15:03:10] <h1ll37> i'm using the fadeOut() function and using it's callback to fadeIn() a different image and it's not waiting til the other is done fading out. http://zhill.co/ is the example. just click the big picture and watch the small ones.
[15:06:20] <fullsailor> ProLoserWork, there's probably a better way.
[15:06:31] <fullsailor> Are you trying to attach an event to everything but that element?
[15:07:19] <fullsailor> I guess a better question is: What are you going to do with the results of the selector.
[15:08:39] <h1ll37> Anyone know about callbacks?
[15:09:18] <fission6> i want a user to select a value from a drop down and when they then click on a buttom - i want to redirect them to a page and have a querystring using the selected input value - how can i do this
[15:10:15] <fullsailor> k1ll37: The problem you're having is you're not passing a callback.
[15:10:23] <fullsailor> You're calling the callback in the fadeOut call
[15:10:48] <h1ll37> fullsailor: isn't that how i'm supposed to do it? sorry new to jquery
[15:11:00] <fullsailor> No you pass in a function to be called.
[15:11:12] <h1ll37> i did?
[15:11:20] <h1ll37> $("img[name="+unload+"_mini]").fadeOut('slow','swing',loadNext(load));
[15:11:34] <h1ll37> isn't that passing in the function to be called fullsailor ^
[15:11:37] <fullsailor> No you passed in the result of loadNext(load)
[15:11:42] <aaairc> why is it that if i have functions in two different <script> tags they don't seem able to reference once another?
[15:11:45] <fullsailor> you should just pass in loadNext
[15:11:47] <aaairc> is there a way to get past that?
[15:11:57] <h1ll37> fullsailor: how do i do that?
[15:12:14] <fullsailor> $("img[name="+unload+"_mini]").fadeOut('slow','swing',loadNext);
[15:12:38] <aaairc> i keep getting an error when i try and call a function in my first <script> that is defined in the second script, that the function is not defined
[15:12:42] <h1ll37> fullsailor: oh.. confused to what the difference is.. but i'll try that
[15:12:48] <ajpiano> h1ll37: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide32
[15:13:03] <faryshta> Hi. How can I compare two jquery objects? Something like $(this)==$("#home")
[15:13:31] <fullsailor> faryshta: In that case I wouldn't compare the jQuery objects
[15:13:33] <ajpiano> faryshta: you can't, you have to compare DOM elements, http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide27
[15:13:40] <fullsailor> Use this.id === 'home'
[15:14:18] <faryshta> ajpiano, let me see.
[15:14:56] <h1ll37> fullsailor: well now it's fading out but the other is not fading in
[15:15:25] <faryshta> fullsailor, thanks.
[15:15:25] <fullsailor> You'll need to change how it determines the load variable.
[15:15:47] <h1ll37> fullsailor: works now thanks a ton man
[15:16:28] <fullsailor> faryshta, h1ll37: You're welcome!
[15:16:30] <h1ll37> fullsailor: so let me clear this up. function() returns whatever function will return and function just runs the function?
[15:16:49] <fullsailor> h1ll37: Basically
[15:17:04] <fullsailor> When you use the parens, it invokes the function
[15:17:18] <fullsailor> When you don't, it passes the function in to be called later.
[15:17:19] <h1ll37> fullsailor: hmm that sure is different from php or java isn't it
[15:18:09] <eddiemonge> h1ll37: well javascript is neither of those so sure
[15:18:15] <io__> i wrote a little .load function in a drupal install you can see it in laplatanera.net/calendar/month, when you click on an entry in the calendar it will load with jqery in the bottom, but if i change month then if yo uclick onto another entry it will load  anew page, how to fix that?
[15:18:21] <grom358> trying to avoid using $.browser. But not sure how to work around IE requiring different row height from chrome/firefox.. http://jsfiddle.net/pc7pK/
[15:18:46] <eddiemonge> h1ll37: functions are really variables and only perform stuff when they have () added to them
[15:19:19] <eddiemonge> grom358: thats why you use $(sel).height()
[15:19:40] <grom358> eddiemonge: $(sel).height() not working for me
[15:19:46] <grom358> like it returns the wrong value
[15:19:47] <eddiemonge> grom358: why not?
[15:19:50] <h1ll37> eddiemonge: well yeah it's neither of those but most languages are somewhat similar in those basic aspects from my experience
[15:20:02] <eddiemonge> grom358: what does it return? what should it return?
[15:20:23] <grom358> eddiemonge: if I do $tr.height($otherRow.height()); the heights of the rows are rendered different
[15:21:03] <aaairc> why is it that a function in one script can reference a function in a different script... if they are both loaded on the same page?
[15:21:05] <grom358> .height sets the css height.. But IE expects the height to not include padding.. whereas chrome/firefox do
[15:25:07] <someprimetime> what is the best way to refactor this? specifically the 2 ajax calls I'm doing: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/3LhkZ/
[15:25:20] <vicci> Hi I've been looking for this for a while now but I can't seem to find a decent jquery plugin that makes it easy to create a stopwatch (for example: click the button to start counting, when clicking on the button again it stores the time and starts counting again from there ... for lap times for example)
[15:25:28] <vicci> Could anyone help me out with this?
[15:25:34] <grom358> so is there some better way to test the browser is IE?
[15:26:19] <staaky> grom358: padding works the same in IE, if padding isn't rendered the element probably needs layout, something you can fix with css, give it float or position:absolute
[15:26:59] <eddiemonge> ?outerheight @ grom358
[15:26:59] <bot-t> grom358, .outerHeight([includeMargin]): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding, border, and optionally margin. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[15:27:32] <eddiemonge> aaairc: because its all executed in the same scope
[15:27:35] <grom358> yes I'm aware of outerheight.. the problem is.. I need the content height when IE.. outerheight when Chrome/Firefox
[15:28:10] <someprimetime> so detect the browser type if IE use height()?
[15:28:24] <someprimetime> if chrome/ff use outerheight()?
[15:28:32] <eddiemonge> vicci: write one. it wouldnt be hard
[15:28:41] <tesmar> hi all, I am looking to write a plugin that just computes a number based on two numbers passed in, but all the guides show that plugins are for manipulating the DOM
[15:28:52] <aaairc> eddiemonge: so the scop is limited to within the <script> tag?
[15:28:54] <vicci> eddiemonge: how would I go about it? with .after etc?
[15:28:55] <staaky> you shouldn't have to make a difference if you fix the css to render things properly in IE
[15:28:55] <grom358> someprimetime: yes correct
[15:28:56] <tesmar> is there any standard way of writing a plugin that just returns numbers?
[15:29:24] <eddiemonge> tesmar: they are really. you are talking about writing a function
[15:29:38] <eddiemonge> aaairc: if you dont specify a scope then its window
[15:30:14] <grom358> staakY: what? no it renders fine. The problem is when using javascript I cloning a table and copying the row heights so it renders the same.. the height that IE expects is different to the height chrome/firefox wants.. That is. IE wants the height without padding/borders. Chrome/Firefox want the height including padding/borders
[15:30:19] <eddiemonge> vicci: huh? you would need to use date, replacing numbers, storing variables and event handlers. but again, not really that hard
[15:30:55] <eddiemonge> grom358: if you cloned a table, the row heights should already be the same
[15:31:27] <staaky> grom358: they probably seem to want that, padding works the same across browsers, not something you should have to fix with javascript
[15:31:31] <grom358> eddiemonge: I only cloning part of the table.. doing like a fixed column
[15:31:48] <tesmar> eddiemonge, is it standard to hang those functions off of jQuery.fn ?
[15:32:23] <someprimetime> anyone have any recommendations though with how i can refactor the ajax calls within: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/3LhkZ/
[15:32:48] <grom358> staaky: and apparently not.. cause I have test case right here
[15:32:52] <someprimetime> i'm new to this type of plugin writing (wrapping everything inside of (function($) which maps to $ to maintain an independent namespace)
[15:33:51] <eddiemonge> tesmar: you could. to make it easier to change the numbers and event handlers. i wouldnt say its standard though. more of a convenience
[15:34:24] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: are you familiar with some other type of plugin writing?
[15:34:32] <eddiemonge> grom358: show us
[15:34:44] <staaky> grom358: well it is IE, css should be able to fix any rendering issues it has
[15:34:54] <obelich> eddiemonge, hiyas it work but for one razon it make a double submit to the form i want to submnit and the other one :( http://pastebin.com/9azyLaUN
[15:35:08] <grom358> okay I made smallest page test possible so u can see what I mean
[15:35:43] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: never written an actual "plugin" before
[15:35:49] <eddiemonge> obelich: mouse enter/leave are kind of bad to use to submit a form from a user perspective
[15:35:56] <someprimetime> but i'd typically namespace stuff like so: http://jsfiddle.net/FheeV/

[15:36:22] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: see that and see if theres anything you can learn from it
[15:36:51] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: this is no different. $.fn.yourplugin is a

[15:37:34] <eddiemonge> staaky: do you get it now?
[15:37:57] <staaky> don't need to see a testpage to know that IE is broken :)

[15:41:22] <someprimetime> i ended up finding another guide which helped me a little bit more
[15:41:31] <someprimetime> let me remove some shit from that code
[15:41:32] <someprimetime> one sec
[15:42:30] <eddiemonge> grom358: which ie?
[15:42:42] <grom358> IE8 I'm testing with here
[15:42:42] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/HwDVe/1/
[15:42:51] <grom358> eddiemonge: IE8
[15:43:23] <someprimetime> just wondering why if i define loadTab as a function within var tabs, that I can't call it within the fn function?
[15:44:31] <eddiemonge> grom358: they look the same to me
[15:45:23] <grom358> eddiemonge: really?? here the overlay ends up taller
[15:45:46] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: look at http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Namespacing
[15:46:26] <eddiemonge> grom358: https://skitch.com/etiger13/g7f1f/edit-this-fiddle-jsfiddle-online-editor-for-the-web-javascript-mootools-jquery-prototype-yui-glow-and-dojo-html-css
[15:46:34] <eddiemonge> ie8 in the right, chrome on the left
[15:47:50] <grom358> eddiemonge: what the.. yeah in jsfiddle it renders right for me too.. but as standalone page it isn't
[15:48:04] <someprimetime> grom358: you probably have other css issues on the page conflicting with it?
[15:48:10] <someprimetime> are you using some kind of css reset or something?
[15:48:16] <someprimetime> and thanks eddiemonge i'll go over it later
[15:48:23] <someprimetime> working on a diff. project atm
[15:48:39] <eddiemonge> grom358: you dont have any !importants do you?
[15:48:54] <grom358> no.. u can see all the test in that jsfiddle
[15:49:14] <grom358> I just made * { padding: 0; margin: 0; } .. still same
[15:49:17] <eddiemonge> ok in that case see ? case closed
[15:49:18] <bot-t> eddiemonge, Attribute Contains Selector [name*="value"] - Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value containing the a given substring. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[15:49:30] <eddiemonge> coldhead: what was i looking for?
[15:50:33] <eddiemonge> ?cc @ grom358
[15:50:34] <bot-t> grom358, CASE CLOASED >: |
[15:50:44] <grom358> no.. it still not working as standalone page
[15:51:05] <eddiemonge> test case works .... so your page is broken
[15:51:16] <grom358> okay.. how is my page broken then?
[15:51:16] <bot-t> (27 secs ago) <eddiemonge> tell grom358 Boom!
[15:51:28] <MeXTuX> I need a script to restrict a field to only numbers ie 00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10 .... and so on. The value can't be bigger than 59 and then it must restart to 00. Any idea?
[15:51:33] <eddiemonge> grom358: no idea. i cant read minds or see through other's eyes
[15:51:59] <grom358> I showed u the page..
[15:52:00] <staaky> it's not broken in a way that requires jquery to fix it
[15:52:00] <eddiemonge> MeXTuX: input type="number" min=0 max=59
[15:52:17] <eddiemonge> grom358: the test case? that works? according to the screenshot i showed?
[15:53:23] <grom358> yeah.. if u get http://jsfiddle.net/K5kP7/2/ and make it html file and load it up it is broken
[15:53:47] <grom358> it only renders fine inside jsfiddle
[15:55:36] <eddiemonge> grom358: https://skitch.com/etiger13/g7fi1/ie8-running see ? cc
[15:55:37] <bot-t> grom358, CASE CLOASED >: |
[15:56:10] <grom358> eddiemonge: well that isn't the result I see
[15:56:12] <eddiemonge> and who uses <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"> still?
[15:56:33] <eddiemonge> grom358: maybe its a i-d ten tee issue?
[15:56:38] <eddiemonge> j/k
[15:56:52] <eddiemonge> or something wrong with your browser. did you try turning it off and on again?
[15:56:56] <staaky> grom: you are probably running IE in compat mode
[15:57:01] <grom358> yeah.. well that doctype is cause its an old page
[15:57:06] <someprimetime> pebkac
[15:57:46] <grom358> omg... that's it.. freaking intranet sites are set to run in compat mode
[15:58:08] <staaky> :)
[15:58:35] <eddiemonge> $("#10")[ T ];  <- jq humor
[15:58:48] <grom358> well that explains why it rendered fine in jsfiddle and not as standalone
[16:00:35] <staaky> guess your next problem will be IE7
[16:00:52] <grom358> yeah.. i don't care about IE7 atm. I just want this to work on the intranet here
[16:01:11] <grom358> and its set to have compat mode on for intranet sites
[16:01:41] <grom358> but yeah.. if I wanted this jquery plugin to work with IE7 I have todo something for it too
[16:01:55] <collinIII> is there an easy way to create a form that can create elements on the fly
[16:03:00] <collinIII> like i have a button for "Add Text Box" and a moveable text box appears for the client to move and place where t hey choose
[16:03:11] <grom358> btw.. I do appreciate the help greatly. I'm just frustrated by the cross browser issues I have been having
[16:03:28] <grom358> at first it was firefox.. now its IE
[16:06:20] <staaky> If you need IE to work, I'd start with IE6 and work up, faster than the other way around
[16:07:00] <grom358> staaky: yeah I only need to support IE8.. just other ppl might like IE versions below that
[16:07:40] <staaky> yeah, nice to have that luxery
[16:08:22] <grom358> its a plugin to have fixed rows/columns on a table. Working perfectly in Firefox/Chrome atm
[16:11:08] <eddiemonge> if you can avoid 6/7 i would, like the plague or onions
[16:13:01] <grom358> is there some way I can force my page to not be in compat mode.. it appears the computers here are set to display in compat mode for intranet sites
[16:14:02] <staaky> there's a meta tag for it
[16:19:18] <grom358> I have found a bug in jquery but
[16:19:45] <grom358> the function getWH doesn't factor in border-collapse when working with table cells
[16:23:35] <eddiemonge> getWH?
[16:23:52] <grom358> yeah in the jquery source
[16:24:25] <grom358> they use getWH for getting width/height
[16:25:47] <grom358> it gets the elem.offsetWidth then removes padding, borders etc. But with border collapse.. that means the width it reports for table cells is wrong when u have borders on the cell
[16:25:48] <mllie> If I have a form with a submit button inside which name is submit. How do I trigger submit()?
[16:25:51] <mllie> on that fomr
[16:25:52] <mllie> form
[16:26:16] <chovy> mllie: what do you mean?
[16:26:32] <mllie> chovy: my submit button inside hte form is named submit
[16:26:35] <chovy> you just click the submit button to trigger the onsubmit event.
[16:26:50] <mllie> chovy: which makes it impossible to call submit() from js
[16:27:07] <staaky> grom: border-collapse is bugged below IE8, css that just isn't safe cross browser is probably not something jquery should take into account, i'd avoid it.
[16:27:24] <mllie> chovy: I want to submit from javascipr
[16:27:28] <mllie> with javascript*
[16:27:31] <chovy> mllie: when the form is submitted, you trap the onsubmit event and do something with it.
[16:27:39] <chovy> $("#form").submit();
[16:27:54] <mllie> chovy: Yes. But that is not working, since my submit button is named submit.
[16:28:06] <mllie> chovy: and no, I cannot change my submit buttons name.
[16:28:24] <chovy> i don't think it matters what the name of the button is. is it of type=submit?
[16:28:26] <mllie> chovy: .submit() tries to get that submit-button instead of actually trigger the event.
[16:28:32] <mllie> chovy: yes
[16:28:54] <chovy> $("#form").submit(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); //do ajax submit });
[16:28:55] <eddiemonge> mllie: whats your forms id?
[16:29:15] <mllie> eddiemonge: not a constant value. Why?
[16:29:33] <mllie> chovy: do that call submit?
[16:29:56] <eddiemonge> mllie: then how are you targeting the form itself?
[16:30:25] <mllie> eddiemonge: by keyup of a textarea inside the form and then .closest("form").submit()
[16:31:00] <eddiemonge> mllie: what happens when you do that?
[16:31:19] <Mookman2881> Is there a simple way to check the status of a remote site (not current domain or server,) using jQuery?
[16:31:34] <mllie> eddiemonge: Property 'submit' of object #<HTMLFormElement> is not a function
[16:33:13] <chovy> mllie: why do you need to submit the form with js?
[16:33:23] <chovy> it should happen when you click the submit button by default.
[16:33:30] <mllie> chovy: because I want to submit on enter key up
[16:33:37] <chovy> ah
[16:33:37] <eddiemonge> mllie: what version of jq?
[16:33:48] <chovy> so they type one letter and you submit the form?
[16:33:50] <mllie> eddiemonge: latest I guess
[16:34:09] <mllie> chovy: when pressing enter-key I submit the form
[16:34:19] <chovy> enter key in a text area?
[16:34:24] <mllie> yes
[16:34:26] <eddiemonge> mllie: you have to change your submit buttons name
[16:34:26] <chovy> ok
[16:34:28] <mllie> shift+enter for newline
[16:34:35] <eddiemonge> form elements cant have id/name of submit
[16:34:36] <mllie> eddiemonge: well. that's not possible
[16:34:40] <chovy> so grab the textarea and then look for the form.
[16:34:45] <eddiemonge> mllie: then you are sol
[16:34:47] <eddiemonge> mllie: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1414
[16:34:53] <chovy> onkeydown event would do something like this:
[16:35:18] <mllie> eddiemonge: well. that's the id, is that enoguht to change?
[16:35:19] <chovy> if ( e.which == '<enter code>' ) { $("textarea").parents("form").submit();
[16:35:22] <chovy> }
[16:35:51] <eddiemonge> mllie: http://api.jquery.com/submit/#notes-0
[16:36:10] <mllie> chovy: that is what I do, and it doesn't work
[16:36:23] <staaky> or just do [0].submit() instead
[16:36:24] <eddiemonge> chovy: mllie none of that matters. it wont work. you HAVE to change the submit names
[16:36:50] <mllie> eddiemonge: ok
[16:37:15] <eddiemonge> its the same as doing something like var length = "bad_idea";
[16:37:44] <mllie> yes
[16:37:47] <mllie> Well, next problem
[16:37:56] <mllie> commentDiv.children("textarea:first").focus();
[16:37:59] <mllie> What's wrong there?
[16:39:18] <mllie> I get cannot call method 'focus' of undefined
[16:39:45] <eddiemonge> that means your children isnt finding anything
[16:40:02] <eddiemonge> is there an immediate child of type textarea below commentDiv?
[16:40:22] <mllie> eddiemonge: no
[16:40:53] <mllie> eddiemonge: well, this doesn't work jQuery(commentDiv).children("textarea").focus();
[16:41:00] <mllie> eddiemonge: that doesn't reutnr undefined
[16:41:05] <mllie> eddiemonge: but still no focus
[16:42:44] <mika2> help
[16:43:00] <mika2> this issue is killing me and i know there is a simple solution
[16:43:04] <mllie> eddiemonge: any idea?
[16:43:12] <mika2> anyone out there listening
[16:44:32] <chovy> mika2: ?
[16:44:33] <eddiemonge> mllie: use .find() if its not an immediate child
[16:45:05] <mika2> using jquery .get   first load page returns error  if I use a dropdown and refresh page .get works perfectly and loads data
[16:45:13] <mika2> why does it not return on the first time through
[16:45:16] <eddiemonge> mllie: its not supposed to return undefined. it returns an empty object/array
[16:45:24] <mika2> code is correct as it works after a refresh
[16:45:35] <mika2> is it the order of how things are loaded
[16:45:36] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ mika2
[16:45:36] <bot-t> mika2, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:45:49] <mika2> am I calling the get before teh page loads?
[16:45:59] <mllie> eddiemonge: well. find did work, thanks
[16:46:17] <eddiemonge> "if I use a dropdown and refresh page" doesnt really make sense. what does a dropdown have to do with a page refresh? and what do you mean by refresh
[16:46:46] <queuetip> mika2: possibly, try moving the js to the very bottom just to test or use .ready()
[16:46:49] <mika2> my drop down changes the page content and after that is done the .get works and loads the data
[16:46:59] <mllie> eddiemonge: thanks alot. gotta go, later on dude!
[16:47:11] <mika2> but when you initially go to the site  it doesn't load the data from .get   I have to use the drop down to get it to work
[16:47:16] <queuetip> mika2: if that doesn't work, then follow the bot-t's instructions with jsfiddle
[16:48:37] <mika2> i can just give info to testing server i'm working on
[16:48:44] <mika2> do i im or just put it here
[16:49:11] <queuetip> mika2: just put it here, if we can access and duplicate the problem then it should be easy for one of these fine good gentleman who help for free to look at it :P
[16:49:37] <queuetip> mika2: or you could also try my suggestion to see if that fixes it first
[16:49:43] <mika2> site is testing.chicagopublicleague.com/CPL2.0    username:  mahall  password: tm87544     when initially go on click on groups and click teh names   on the right shoudl be the list of people in those groups but not working  use the sport dropdown to change teh sport and then click the group name people show up
[16:53:49] <eddiemonge> click on groups where? My Groups?
[16:54:08] <queuetip> eddiemonge: yes : / i had to decipher what he was saying, but i'm able to reproduce it like that
[16:54:24] <mika2> yes My Groups  sorry  in the accordion on the left
[16:54:25] <Agbeladem> I'm in such a bad mood
[16:54:42] <Agbeladem> ajax call never returns on Google Chrome, it does everywhere else, any ideas ?
[16:54:47] <mika2> moved script to bottom didnt' help
[16:54:57] <eddiemonge> mika2: so whats not working correctly? looks fine to me. where is it no working?
[16:55:06] <eddiemonge> Agbeladem: code?
[16:55:16] <queuetip> eddiemonge: the first time you click a group in my groups, you'll get an alert "Error"
[16:55:32] <queuetip> eddiemonge: and the get in firebug for me is red, although it's returning 200 (okay)
[16:55:37] <mika2> when you initially go to the page and click my groups the people dont' show up but after you use the drop down  and click teh group name the people show up
[16:55:39] <queuetip> eddiemonge: so it's a bit strange
[16:56:47] <mika2> code works only after a refresh of the screen using the drop down to change the sport  :-(    been at this for 3 days  can't get the group members to show up on initial load of page
[16:56:59] <Agbeladem> eddiemonge: http://pastebin.com/faN7sXJe
[16:57:50] <eddiemonge> queuetip mika2 what browser? chrome looks fine
[16:58:35] <queuetip> eddiemonge: FF
[16:58:56] <queuetip> mika2: it's not the call that's broken... because if you just go to: http://www.chicagopublicleague.com/cpltesting/CPL2.0/controllers/models/GroupDetails.php?mygid=87 then it works just fine
[16:59:02] <queuetip> mika2: the problem is when it's trying to append
[16:59:13] <Agbeladem> eddiemonge: for the record, it doesn't even work with a '' data, or a specified dataType, or anything (and async:false freezes  chrome)
[16:59:26] <Shai-Tan> In jquery ui how can I have a "logout" tab forward to the index page when clicked?
[16:59:58] <eddiemonge> Shai-Tan: on click window.location
[17:00:13] <Shai-Tan> oh, that easy :) thanks
[17:00:23] <queuetip> mika2: use .ready() first before you use the changeChangeMainContent(groupid) function
[17:00:40] <queuetip> mika2: so that you know the entire dom is loaded
[17:01:16] <Agbeladem> eddiemonge: any ideas ?
[17:01:52] <eddiemonge> Agbeladem:  what happens? seems like it should work but with out a live example its hard to know
[17:03:32] <Agbeladem> eddiemonge: I have no call to error(), to complete(), or to success(). The loaded page usually loads in less than a second. I have the same script included on another page and it runs perfectly. I got no javascript errors. This page works fine on Firefox ou IE. On Chrome, the request just seems never to return -___-'
[17:03:53] <eddiemonge> mika2: $(document).ready(function() {  }); is the same as $(function()  {   });
[17:07:00] <mika2> $(document).read(function() {  .get(â€¦.    or should I call changeMainContent in a .ready?
[17:07:07] <mika2> what goes in the .ready  just the call to .get?
[17:07:10] <mika2> or the entire funciton
[17:08:05] <queuetip> mika2: the entire function
[17:08:27] <queuetip> $(function(groupid) { ... and replace "function" with your function
[17:08:34] <queuetip> mika2: ^^
[17:09:42] <mika2> when I put that function in a ready and now when I try to click on the group name nothing happens  I guess that is progress
[17:09:52] <eddiemonge> mika2: i havent examined the code but replace all the js on that page, with this one: http://jsfiddle.net/BuVse/
[17:09:55] <mika2> but at what point is the damn document ready for me to click and how do I know
[17:10:05] <eddiemonge> put it in an external file and then reference that file
[17:11:34] <eddiemonge> mika2: get rid of the inline js. the onclicks.
[17:11:38] <queuetip> mika2: you have an error in your javascript
[17:12:17] <mika2> i tried the external thing
[17:12:24] <mika2> messages up other jquery stuff on page
[17:12:30] <mika2> try now qt
[17:12:32] <queuetip> mika2: }//end document ready ... make it like this: }); //end document ready
[17:14:12] <queuetip> mika2: and get firebug and look at the console tab while you're doing this... missing ) after argument list .. }//end document ready line 305
[17:14:17] <mika2> tried to put everything in doc ready   messages up my page format
[17:14:37] <eddiemonge> mika2: your main problem though is the function: changeMainContent
[17:15:05] <queuetip> mika2: change this line: }//end document ready .... to this line: });// end document ready
[17:15:10] <Agbeladem> eddiemonge: I see my target page in the "network" tab of the developper tools. However, there is no response. The request headers are set though.
[17:15:14] <eddiemonge> jk ignore for now
[17:15:15] <queuetip> mika2: you're just missing ); at the end
[17:15:32] <eddiemonge> Agbeladem: and if you try to load the requested page in a new tab?
[17:15:59] <Agbeladem> eddiemonge: Can't really it works with post data. But the same script works on another page
[17:19:32] <eddiemonge> Agbeladem: in the console right click the link and click open in new tab
[17:19:57] <eddiemonge> mika2: your page needs a lot of work. like align isnt really valid
[17:21:40] <mika2> this issue is really urkin me!
[17:21:53] <mika2> guess imma have to abort this jquery mission and just use my plain ole php skills
[17:21:58] <mika2> thanks for trying guys
[17:22:40] <eddiemonge> mika2: look get rid of all the javascript below the jquery tag on your page
[17:22:58] <Agbeladem> eddiemonge: it only works when I stop the ajax call
[17:23:17] <eddiemonge> mika2: im going to walk you through this
[17:23:20] <eddiemonge> Agbeladem: ?
[17:23:40] <Agbeladem> eddiemonge: well it's pending and pending. But the page opens if I close the tab where my ajax call is made
[17:23:57] <mika2> @eddiemonge    entire script?
[17:24:05] <mika2> what jquery page?
[17:24:44] <eddiemonge> mika2: all the javascript you have on that page, delete it
[17:24:59] <eddiemonge> everything except for the jqueryui and jquery.js files
[17:25:21] <mika2> ok eddie  look at it   all js gone
[17:25:23] <mika2> :-(
[17:25:40] <mika2> now my page looks horrible
[17:25:43] <aaairc_> eddiemonge: so i figured out what you were saying before with scope, but now i have another question... if i have two script tags both with the $('document').ready... the function in the second document.ready doesn't seem to be able to see the function in the first document.read... despite it coming first
[17:25:55] <eddiemonge> mika2: do you need a xhtml 1.0 transitional page?
[17:26:05] <Agbeladem> eddiemonge: Okay I tried putting header('Content-Type: text/html); echo '0'; exit(); on my target page. Still doesn't load
[17:26:10] <eddiemonge> aaairc_: those are in different scopes
[17:26:16] <mika2> need?
[17:26:20] <eddiemonge> aaairc_: you need to make a custom namespace
[17:26:21] <mika2> guess not?
[17:26:45] <eddiemonge> mika2: change the doctype to <!DOCTYPE html> for funsies
[17:26:49] <aaairc_> eddiemonge: how do i do that? should i just google jquery namespace?
[17:28:27] <Agbeladem> eddiemonge: mean anything to you ?
[17:28:42] <chee> <!doctype html public "i like snakes">
[17:29:31] <eddiemonge> aaairc_: yeah. its pretty much though: var MYAPP = {}; then in your ready blocks, MYAPP.varname = whateve; in your other block you can then reference MYAPP.varname
[17:29:49] <PhonicUK> can I 'create' an element from a chunk of HTML without appending it to another element?
[17:29:55] <eddiemonge> Agbeladem: tha sounds like a server issue then
[17:30:10] <eddiemonge> mika2: one sec, writing this up for you easier like
[17:30:14] <Agbeladem> eddiemonge: no, I put the url at google.com and it doesn't work either. Or it's not related ?
[17:30:26] <catcher> I'm loading in a bunch of data via ajax, and I'm finding a lot of html (mixed with data inserted from .each) in my .js. What's the 'right' way to generate pages of content this way?
[17:30:36] <aaairc_> eddiemonge: ok cool, thanks!
[17:30:56] <eddiemonge> Agbeladem: what do you mean? got a live example?
[17:31:20] <Agbeladem> eddiemonge: I'll make one tomorrow if it keeps happening
[17:32:33] <grom358> IE go die in a freaking fire
[17:37:58] <eddiemonge> mika2: put these in their respective places http://jsfiddle.net/BuVse/3/
[17:38:15] <eddiemonge> the js in javascript.js and the css in styles.css with the paths pointed correctly
[17:38:26] <eddiemonge> once thats done, let me know and we'll go from there
[17:38:35] <eddiemonge> the html needs a LOT of work though
[17:40:02] <mika2> i'm confused
[17:40:15] <mika2> cleaning up the formatting is not helping my .get not error
[17:40:18] <mika2> it's still erroring
[17:40:22] <mika2> on initial
[17:40:28] <mika2> but works after i use drop down
[17:40:36] <mika2> that's the original problem
[17:41:04] <mika2> says method not allowed 405
[17:41:08] <mika2> what does that mean???
[17:41:15] <mika2> http:// 405   method not allowed 166ms
[17:43:00] <eddiemonge> one thing at a time grasshopper
[17:43:04] <eddiemonge> do the stuff i said first
[17:44:55] <eddiemonge> mika2: and it wasnt just formatting cleanup i added
[17:46:06] <eddiemonge> mika2: change this part http://jsfiddle.net/BuVse/4/
[17:46:17] <mika2> ok
[17:46:25] <cosmicelf> howdy all
[17:46:45] <mika2> 2 files created
[17:46:49] <cosmicelf> quick question?
[17:47:22] <cosmicelf> I have a new image created with javascript..  how do you make that an href link?
[17:47:47] <mika2> this is how my head looks now    http://jsfiddle.net/BuVse/4/
[17:49:57] <eddiemonge> mika2: the 405 is because of this line: <base href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/" />
[17:50:07] <eddiemonge> you arent google so that shouldnt be your base href
[17:51:33] <mika2> ok removed it
[17:51:40] <mika2> still getting an error  now 404  not found 102ms
[17:52:07] <eddiemonge> cosmicelf: how is it created?
[17:53:35] <eddiemonge> mika2: doesnt your source code just look so much better to you? it does to me
[17:53:36] <mika2> [19:53:14.712] GET http://testing.chicagopublicleague.com/cpltesting/CPL2.0/controllers/models/GroupDetails.php?mygid=86 [HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found 164ms]
[17:53:47] <mika2> :-)   yes eddiemonge   thanks
[17:53:54] <mika2> but what about my error!
[17:54:08] <eddiemonge> the 404 is because the links arent correct
[17:54:11] <eddiemonge> as in the urls
[17:54:45] <eddiemonge> mika2: so for changeMainContent function, use this instead : http://jsfiddle.net/BuVse/6/
[17:55:13] <cosmicelf> eddie:  just a sec..
[17:55:59] <cosmicelf> badge = new Image();
[17:56:00] <cosmicelf>      badge.src = "/sites/all/themes/kfp/images/years-of-service.png";
[17:56:06] <cosmicelf> like that
[17:56:34] <eddiemonge> cosmicelf: what is it you  want to do exactly?
[17:57:15] <cosmicelf> i want to make that image a link
[17:57:18] <cosmicelf> an href
[17:58:05] <cosmicelf> is there some way to do that with by adding something to this line...
[17:58:06] <cosmicelf> $(badge).addClass("specialBadge");
[17:58:15] <mika2> Eddiemonge  you are a genius!!!!!!   but now my logout is brokenâ€¦.   what did I do wrong ?  can you explain this mistake to me so I won't do it on other pages?
[17:58:21] <cosmicelf> i do that next after i create it and set the src
[17:58:40] <aaairc_> eddiemonge: is it ok to define functions outside the $(document).ready that reference html etc, just as long as the function is only called within the document.read() after all the HTML has been laid out?
[17:59:35] <eddiemonge> mika2: try dropping the cpltesting from the url as well
[17:59:46] <aaairc_> meaning if i have $('div').doSomething in my function... does jQuery do all the $('div') matching at the time when the function is initially defined, or when the function is later called?
[18:00:27] <mika2> well this is testing right now
[18:00:38] <eddiemonge> mika2: not entirely but mostly i think it was that you were missing the dataType for the .get()s http://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/
[18:01:02] <eddiemonge> mika2: you should checkout HTML5BoilerPlate to see how to clean up your HTML
[18:01:13] <mika2> ok
[18:03:13] <mika2> ok i will try to following this html5 boilerplate  :-)
[18:03:18] <mika2> thanks for your help eddie!!
[18:04:08] <eddiemonge> cosmicelf: $("<img>", { src: "whatev.er", alt: "", className: "redBadgeofCourage" }).wrap('<a>', {href: "gowhere?"}).appendTo('somewhereinDOM')
[18:04:21] <eddiemonge> aaairc_: yes
[18:04:42] <eddiemonge> aaairc_: wait, paste what you mean at jsfiddle and ill tell you
[18:04:56] <aaairc_> eddiemonge: ok one sec
[18:08:16] <mika2> eddiemonge:  can you give me an example of my bad html  i wanna clean it up. â€¦   but I have all php code really?   the html in the php is bad???
[18:08:37] <joshualibrarian> is there a simple way to select for 'all images with a background-image set'?
[18:09:51] <eddiemonge> the html outputted by the php is bad. really bad
[18:09:53] <eddiemonge> sorry
[18:10:12] <eddiemonge> joshualibrarian: you have images with background images?
[18:10:40] <joshualibrarian> edditmonge:  I guess I meant every tag in a range...
[18:13:36] <cosmicelf> hm.. ok
[18:13:38] <cosmicelf> interesting
[18:13:48] <aaairc_> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/KrbKy/2/
[18:14:35] <eddiemonge> joshualibrarian: you would have to loop through them. pretty slow. or you could add a class to them
[18:15:02] <joshualibrarian> eddiemonge:  hmm... okay, thank you.  :)
[18:15:26] <eddiemonge> aaairc_: better: http://jsfiddle.net/KrbKy/3/
[18:16:38] <aaairc_> eddiemonge: is that better because the matching that happens within the doSomething function occurs when the function is defined vs when it is called?
[18:21:17] <eddiemonge> mika2: heres to get you started: http://jsbin.com/aqexof/edit#javascript,html
[18:21:27] <aaairc_> does anyone know when jquery matching occurs for a selector if the selector is in a function? is it when the function is originally defined or when the function is called?
[18:21:48] <eddiemonge> with the tip to learn unobtrusive CSS, unobtrusive JS, and HTML5 (or at the least HTML4 strict)
[18:22:09] <eddiemonge> aaairc_: when its called
[18:22:14] <iMoon> aaairc_, when called
[18:22:23] <aaairc_> ok great thanks!
[18:23:41] <mika2> thanks Eddiemonge
[18:25:57] <collinIII> wtf
[18:27:48] <dmfrey> when i explicitly tell either $.ajax or $.getJSON to send a content type = application/json, it seems to be disregarded. am i doing something wrong?
[18:28:42] <eddiemonge> collinIII: yeah WTF!!!!!?
[18:28:59] <eddiemonge> dmfrey: probabl
[18:29:05] <chee> wtf

[18:31:52] <Josh89> cus i ned help
[18:32:46] <iMoon> What do you need Josh?
[18:33:09] <Killswitch> About tree fiddy.

[18:33:33] <Josh89> wana uze it hack my cuzzin
[18:34:02] <Killswitch> ... "kan" ... "uze" ... "cuzzin" ...
[18:34:11] <Killswitch> Why not use the real letters since you're not shortening the word any...
[18:34:25] <eddiemonge> dmfrey: sorry. hear you go: y
[18:35:30] <eddiemonge> Josh89: r u for realz homie?
[18:35:51] <Josh89> Yeah man
[18:36:01] <Josh89> Sorry, my brother is a fool...
[18:36:05] <Josh89> He took my laptop from me
[18:36:22] <Josh89> I'm in here because I'm actually starting to learn JQuery
[18:36:30] <Killswitch> Josh89: try $(document).haxxgibsonz({hacker_statuts: "BALLAH!!"});
[18:37:02] <Josh89> LOL! @KillSwitch
[18:37:16] <Josh89> I don't need no help with JQuery
[18:37:22] <Josh89> It was my brother trying act funny
[18:37:26] <Killswitch> Your broseph does though.
[18:37:39] <Killswitch> You should print out the whole documentation of jQuery and beat him with it.
[18:38:00] <tw2113> sadly, i understood some of this convo
[18:38:03] <dmfrey> eddiemonge, any idea why contentType will not get set?
[18:38:14] <eddiemonge> dmfrey: because you arent setting it?
[18:38:38] <dmfrey> but I am explicitly setting it
[18:39:52] <eddiemonge> how so?
[18:40:02] <dmfrey> eddiemonge, firebug shows it as 'text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1' but i am setting it to 'application/json'
[18:41:34] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ dmfrey
[18:41:34] <bot-t> dmfrey, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:42:56] <dmfrey> eddiemonge, thanks, i will do that. i didn't know that site existed
[18:48:50] <joshualibrarian> http://jsfiddle.net/x2dJj/36/  if you click left once and then right twice quickly, it animates one too many times.  only one block in, as well.  and stop is already called with (true, true).  any ideas?  :)
[18:50:32] <codepython777> any people here who are good with jquery-jcarousel? I could use some help with it.  I mainly want to put the widget in a particular position on the canvas with a certain size.
[18:54:35] <Whirl3d> joshualibrarian, stop(true, true) tells it to complete the animation before starting the next animation. So it appears to jump quickly
[18:55:20] <Whirl3d> true stop(true, false)
[18:57:55] <joshualibrarian> Whirl3d:  when I do that, it stops and get's offcenter with one of the squares.   :(
[18:58:05] <joshualibrarian> http://jsfiddle.net/x2dJj/38/
[18:58:49] <joshualibrarian> I could manually check to see if it's lined up and line it up in the complete, eh...
[19:00:35] <Whirl3d> I would store an index number of the left most item and then always animate to a whole number multiple of the width of a box from that position
[19:01:14] <Whirl3d> then your left and right buttons would only increment index by 1 or -1 and the animation would know the dest position.
[19:02:10] <joshualibrarian> Whirl3d:  ah, very good idea...
[19:03:02] <dmfrey> i have setup an example on jsfiddle.net: http://jsfiddle.net/cXtr7/4/
[19:03:32] <dmfrey> i am attempting to make a jsonp call to a server with a contentType = application/json
[19:03:52] <dmfrey> however the contentType never gets set
[19:03:59] <dmfrey> always goes a text/html
[19:04:44] <dmfrey> what am I doing wrong that it won't set the content type correctly?
[19:06:08] <iMoon> The actual page you're getting the data from must set the content type, I believe. At least I know that this would work properly.
[19:07:44] <dmfrey> iMoon, please check out http://stream.tllts.org/restaurant/display
[19:08:28] <dmfrey> the only difference between this page and the test page I am working on is that the remote page is not making a jsonp request
[19:09:28] <dmfrey> the json service works as intended when it is being invoked locally
[19:10:42] <iMoon> The URL that you are trying to get the JSON code from, what content-type header value is present when it is accessed from a remote location?
[19:10:58] <collinIII> like i have a button for "Add Text Box" and a moveable text box appears for the client to move and place where t hey choose
[19:11:06] <collinIII> is there an easy way to create a form that can create elements on the fly
[19:11:11] <collinIII> like i have a button for "Add Text Box" and a moveable text box appears for the client to move and place where t hey choose
[19:11:19] <collinIII> wtf stuff keeps duplicating
[19:11:41] <dmfrey> iMoon, here is the actual page being used for remote jsonp calls: http://pastebin.com/vr5CyMky
[19:12:18] <dmfrey> to answer your question, it should be application/json in all situations, local or remote
[19:12:27] <iMoon> I'm talking about the page you are retrieving your data from
[19:12:39] <iMoon> what content-type is the header for that page?
[19:13:00] <dmfrey> there is no page specifically
[19:13:07] <dmfrey> it is a Spring MVC application
[19:13:50] <dmfrey> the controllers inside for this particular request don't point to a page but are activated by the presence of the content type being application/json or application/xml
[19:13:59] <dmfrey> each will return respective data
[19:14:02] <iMoon> so this URL: http://stream.tllts.org/restaurant/1 is not being served from a web server?
[19:14:10] <dmfrey> if you go the same url n a browser, you get an html page
[19:14:22] <dmfrey> yes it is
[19:14:45] * puccio notte a tutti
[19:16:51] <dmfrey> iMoon, if you enter curl -i -X GET -H "Content-type: application/json" http://stream.tllts.org/restaurant/1, you get the expected results
[19:17:56] <iMoon> I see. I understand better what you were trying to do now.
[19:19:04] <dmfrey> am i invoking getJSON incorrectly when attempting to do a jsonp request?
[19:19:50] <sgronblo> Is there no event for observing when an element changes but without it having to lose focus?
[19:20:00] <dmfrey> or $.ajax, i have been trying them both
[19:20:38] <iMoon> I'm pretty sure the settings in ajaxSetup aren't used by getJSON, at least from documentation it doesn't seem that way
[19:20:54] <iMoon> I'm not too familiar with this topic, sorry that I'm not helpful
[19:21:41] <dmfrey> thanks anyway, i appreciate your help
[19:21:56] <grom358> omg.. finally got this thing working in IE8, Chrome and Firefox

[19:36:20] <shanario> what's the best way to catch only the first keydown event fired from a key being depressed?
[19:36:59] <shanario> i could use $.one and reset the event handler inside itself but it seems like there should be a better way
[19:39:32] <here4thegear> so... maybe a dumb question but... I'm using $.ajax to grab JSON data from an external webservice. Is there a way (without page refreshing) to use this data in my php page?
[19:41:03] <Eviltwin> here4thegear: Explain further
[19:43:11] <here4thegear> index.php I'm using $.ajax and passing it lat/lon from jquery.geolocation.js in order to get data (from an external service) about the user location. From here, I need to query my db for the data that I have on that zip code and display..
[19:43:50] <here4thegear> actually, I think I have a solution... I can pass the result of the first ajax request to a secondary page on my site via a second ajax call
[19:45:35] <shanario> what's the best way to catch only the first keydown event fired from a key being depressed?
[19:46:10] <Eviltwin> ?.one @ shanario
[19:46:11] <bot-t> shanario, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[19:48:28] <shanario> Eviltwin: i'd like to do it every time a key is pressed
[19:48:56] <shanario> i'm trying to avoid multiple keydown calls. should i just reattach the handler at the end of itself?
[19:49:20] <Eviltwin> There is only one keydown for each press
[19:51:13] <malikmasr> how can i add one day to a date string?
[19:51:26] <malikmasr> i know i can do date.parse to convert string to date, but how can i add one day to that item?
[19:51:32] <shanario> weird i'm getting several with $( document ).keydown(function(){})
[19:51:46] <shanario> as long as i hold the key down
[19:52:50] <Eviltwin> shanario: That's probably your OS's way of handling key repeats
[19:53:24] <shanario> i don't understand, i thought it was normalized in jquery
[19:53:26] <malikmasr> any ideas?
[19:53:47] <malikmasr> i cant just do date.parse('datestring') + 1d can i?
[19:54:10] <Eviltwin> shanario: ...
[19:56:15] <shanario> ...
[20:00:35] <Eviltwin> shanario: You'll need to do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/mDzYv/
[20:00:48] <dmsuperman> I'm looking to smoothly-but-quickly scroll a user to the top but if they try to scroll, stop scrolling them. Does anybody know of a plugin that does this already?
[20:01:46] <shanario> Eviltwin: cool thanks
[20:23:47] <y3di> hey guys, im thinking of creating an app that uses a restful api backend to do generic database manipulation. I'm wondering if it makes sense to use a js framework (maybe some of the model-view variety).
[20:23:56] <y3di> if so, does anyone have suggestions
[20:24:13] <y3di> there are alot of opinions on the current js frameworks out there and its hard to find out whats best for my usecase
[20:24:52] <here4thegear> okay so, I'm doing $.ajax to http://ws.geonames.org/findNearbyPostalCodesJSON?formatted=true&lat=30.267153&lng=-97.74306 the JSON is all in the body... on success: function(data){} I'm not sure how to access these pieces of data
[20:26:06] <here4thegear> I can assing $("#element").html(data); and that works to dump all of that into a div but, alert(data.postalCodes) gives me an error.
[20:27:28] <zCoder> Who ever has expriance programming and is reliable and wants a solid part time or full time job.. PM me.
[20:28:15] <jpk> Hi, question: I have a <pre id="my_pre"></pre> I want to stuff text into.  That text might contain some html.  What's the best way to do that?  I tried $("#my_pre").append(text); but any html in the text seems to be rendered as if it wasn't in a the pre.
[20:28:19] <here4thegear> Also alert(data.postalCodes[0].adminName2); is undefined... even though it clearly is not within the structure.
[20:32:05] <here4thegear> jpk: try $("#my_pre").html(text);
[20:32:37] <Amel> That won't work
[20:32:45] <Amel> http://jsfiddle.net/hEp5E/9/
[20:32:54] <Amel> :P
[20:35:08] <Amel> jpk, pre tags will render html
[20:39:14] <here4thegear> Please take a look at the source here http://mdiviesti.com/geolo/
[20:39:32] <jpk> My understanding is the whole point of pre is that it doesn't.
[20:39:50] <here4thegear> I'm trying to figure out how to access the postalCodes items in the JSON which you see printed
[20:40:09] <pifantastic> jpk: <pre> preserve whitespace
[20:40:12] <pifantastic> that's all they do
[20:41:03] <pifantastic> ?jsonp @ here4thegear
[20:41:03] <here4thegear> you can see in my ks I'm using alert(data.postalCodes[0].adminName2); which apparently doesn't access antying
[20:41:03] <pifantastic> here4thegear: you cannot make ajax requests across domain
[20:41:03] <pifantastic> the only workaround is to use JSONP
[20:41:28] <Eviltwin> jpk: see ?.text
[20:41:43] <Eviltwin> api.jquery.com/text
[20:42:21] <pifantastic> here4thegear: try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/pifantastic/SppWa/
[20:44:29] <here4thegear> pifantastic: that is awesome!
[20:44:52] <jpk> pifantastic: You can also set Access-Control- headers coming from the server to tell the browser it's okay to make cross-domain requests.
[20:45:10] <pifantastic> jpk: not if you're using a third party API which you have no control over
[20:45:57] <jpk> clearly
[20:51:43] <jpk> Eviltwin: Ah, quality.  That does it, thanks. :)
[21:22:52] <grom358> think of any performance improvements for http://jsfiddle.net/KpHVx/2/ ?
[21:35:23] <grom358> should I be storing my elements in array then appending to the page with one call to append ?
[21:35:28] <Amel> Looks neat

[21:46:40] <gkatsev> there is also a simpler script (i think) on scripts.irssi.org
[21:50:20] <zCoder> Who ever has expriance programming and is reliable and wants a solid part time or full time job.. PM me.
[21:52:59] <progrock`> gkatsev: thanks, very cool
[21:53:37] <progrock`> now all I need is to settle on a fucking oh my zsh theme, random keeps throwing me off
[22:03:33] <progrock`> anyone good with node here?
[22:03:49] <gkatsev> progrock`: node ftw. but #Node.js
[22:03:58] <gkatsev> and now I sleep.
[22:04:29] <progrock`> i know, i asked there first
[22:04:32] <progrock`> no answer
[22:11:52] <jklop> why when add an element whit .append function this happen? when I add an item directly works, but when I add it after a click does not work. here is an example of this http://jsfiddle.net/mcMSA/  i dont understand why
[22:12:49] <Cork> uh.. it doesn't?
[22:13:28] <Cork> jklop: what browser are you testing this in?
[22:13:45] <jklop> chrome, firefox
[22:14:02] <Cork> check so you don't have any strange extensions then
[22:14:05] <Cork> wfm
[22:14:47] <jklop> no nathing cork :/
[22:14:48] <spiffie> you're going to run into trouble with multiple elements with the same ID. also, you're attaching the click event at load, but after you insert new content, that content isn't going to get the click event automatically. you need to look into .on()
[22:14:55] <spiffie> ?on
[22:14:55] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[22:15:48] <Cork> jklop: ah, you mean the "#pclick" click event doesn't work?
[22:16:52] <jklop> thanks spiffie, but is is the only method for working with dynamically added items?
[22:17:17] <jklop> which is good practice for this?
[22:17:21] <Cork> jklop: delegate and live works too, if your in older jquery
[22:17:37] <Cork> they'r depricated in jqeury 1.7
[22:17:43] <Cork> *jquery
[22:17:48] <spiffie> yes, on or delegate is the best practice, depending on your version
[22:18:45] <jklop> thanks, and for example, add a block whit html and javascript is a good practice?
[22:19:20] <Cork> jklop: its kinda needed if you want to dynamically change the page :)
[22:19:36] <Cork> jklop: though like stated, you shouldn't reuse the same id though
[22:20:02] <jklop> aa thanks
[22:20:44] <Cork> jklop: actually if you add a lot of elements, often its better to use classes and things like index()
[22:21:00] <Cork> (instead of id's)
[22:21:13] <jklop> is hard for me to handle files javascript. I do not know which is the best way, I wish there was an tutorial for this sort of thing xD
[22:21:37] <Cork> handle files javascript?
[22:21:42] <Cork> what do you mean?
[22:21:43] <jklop> I will find out Cork, thanks
[22:21:47] <jklop> sorry my english
[22:21:54] <jklop> translate google xD
[22:25:47] <angelazou> hi, I'm trying to change the value of a text field based on the radio option selected
[22:26:05] <angelazou> I have a paste here http://jsfiddle.net/F2qUt/, and I've already tried 3 methods, none of which works
[22:28:42] <angelazou> I just need to know one of 2 things: how do I detect if a radio button has been selected? or how do I detect the current value of the radio button that's selected?
[22:29:30] <Cork> angelazou: http://jsfiddle.net/F2qUt/1/
[22:29:38] <Cork> val is a function
[22:29:43] <Cork> you can't assign values to it :)
[22:30:10] <Cork> and a tip for the future, check the error console
[22:30:23] <angelazou> Cork: I see
[22:30:35] <angelazou> but my safari error console didn't give me anything back
[22:30:41] <Cork> ouch
[22:30:49] <Cork> use another browser then
[22:31:25] <Cork> i fixed up the selectors you used a bit too
[22:31:30] <Cork> so it might be that too
[22:31:45] <angelazou> okay, thanks
[22:31:49] <Cork> np
[22:32:22] <angelazou> quick question, what does the $ in function($) mean?
[22:32:29] <angelazou> is it passing the DOM object?
[22:33:14] <Cork> angelazou: not even sure heady uses that param
[22:33:58] <Cork> oh, so it does
[22:34:05] <Cork> fn.call( document, jQuery );
[22:34:28] <Cork> it basicallt ensures that $ is jquery in the callback
[22:34:45] <Cork> *basically
[22:34:59] <angelazou> I see
[22:41:45] <grom358> is there way I can get list of all attributes on a node? or alternatively.. clone a tr element without its children
[22:43:12] <coldhead> var childless = $('tr').clone().empty()
[22:44:13] <grom358> coldhead: ah yeah.. what performance of that gonna be like though
[22:45:22] <coldhead> acceptable, i hope
[22:48:09] <grom358> its okay.. I think the slowest part of this thing is looping through all the rows to calculate row heights.. I made it a config option now, since most of the time its not necessary to calculate row heights for most tables
[22:48:41] <Cork> grom358: alternativly you can use $(elm).prop('atributes')
[22:48:47] <Cork> *attributes
[22:48:56] <Cork> though i think clone is faster
[22:49:26] <grom358> I think even column width calculations could be configurable.
[22:50:29] <grom358> though the number of columns should be small in comparison to rows
[22:50:42] <Jonno_FTW> what is the general process of optimising jquery?
[22:51:59] <Cork> grom358: thers another option, use the native cloneNode(false)
[22:52:00] <grom358> okay.. here what got so far, http://jsfiddle.net/grom358/2Gfyz/
[22:52:13] <Cork> it'll only clone the dom element and not its children
[22:53:10] <coldhead> that's a lot of code
[22:53:35] <coldhead> you and your native methods, Cork, honestly
[22:54:02] <Cork> $(elm).prop('cloneNode')(false) ;P
[22:54:20] <grom358> sorry.. had debug statements.. here is the proper one, http://jsfiddle.net/grom358/q5DwZ/
[22:54:25] <coldhead> hahahahhah
[22:54:29] <coldhead> very good
[22:56:07] <grom358> well time to go home.. enjoy. Hope my fiddle is of use to someone else too
[22:56:17] <coldhead> happy tails, grom358 !
[22:56:22] <coldhead> trails* even >: |
[22:58:06] <coldhead> DOWN WITH STONKY
[22:59:25] <angelazou> Cork: are you still here?
[22:59:31] <Cork> sure
[22:59:49] <angelazou> I don't know what did I do wrong, but when I apply to the actual example, it didn't work
[22:59:54] <angelazou> http://jsfiddle.net/F2qUt/7/
[23:03:04] <Cork> angelazou: $"#field_104-0")
[23:03:10] <Cork> that won't work :)
[23:03:27] <Cork> again, get your self a browser with a working error console
[23:04:16] <eddiemonge> do i need a cors response for normal scripts?
[23:04:43] <Cork> eddiemonge: cors response?
[23:04:55] <Cork> what are you talking about?
[23:07:42] <eddiemonge> im getting a XMLHttpRequest cannot load is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin trying to load a non-json, normal js script
[23:10:01] <Cork> eddiemonge: ah, you need cors response for anything loaded over xhr that isn't from the same domain
[23:10:32] <Cork> eddiemonge: when scripts is loaded to avoid the xss block, its done through generating a script tag and adding it to head
[23:11:17] <eddiemonge> so google, twitter and facebook all use cors to allow cdn and external scripts?
[23:11:28] <eddiemonge> i am so tired im blanking on this
[23:11:48] <Cork> eddiemonge: no they use <script> tags
[23:12:17] <mikesm> hello, I have an api where I can access my views via $.get($url, function(view){});. Since the view is returned as a string I cannot use a css pointer. Is there a library for this, or a way to use css selectors for searching the string of html?
[23:12:58] <Cork> mikesm: $(view).find
[23:13:12] <angelazou> Cork: I don't understand, I fixed all the errors that Firefox told me about, but it's still not working
[23:13:25] <angelazou> updated version http://jsfiddle.net/F2qUt/8/
[23:13:26] <Cork> mikesm: or $('<your selector', view) if you prefer that
[23:13:44] <kakeman> using .post() what is difference between .success and .complete?
[23:14:30] <mikesm> Cork: can I use any function such as addClass() ?
[23:15:18] <mikesm> Cork: Or in particular I want to edit the html
[23:16:13] <Cork> angelazou: http://jsfiddle.net/F2qUt/9/
[23:16:27] <Cork> mikesm: yes you can
[23:18:46] <eddiemonge> Cork: thats what im saying. im using script too and getting that response
[23:21:04] <eddiemonge> kakeman: success was successful where complete is done, success or errror
[23:21:32] <Cork> eddiemonge: if you by script mean type: 'script' thats not what i meant
[23:22:00] <Cork> type script still does a xhr request and then evaluates it through a script tag
[23:22:48] <Cork> if your doing it from another domain you need to do it as <script src="http://other.domain.tld/url/script.js?params=value"></script>
[23:23:31] <eddiemonge> Cork: yeah thats what im doing
[23:23:52] <Cork> that doesn't hit cors
[23:23:54] <kakeman> does .ready trigger only once or every time something changes in dom?
[23:24:16] <Cork> kakeman: only when the page has loaded to the point where the dom is safe to work with
[23:24:26] <Cork> nothing else
[23:25:57] <eddiemonge> Cork: thats what im saying. so i have no idea why google is throwing the sop error
[23:26:09] <Cork> eddiemonge: you have a link?
[23:27:11] <palm> hi, while working with xml, can i create new nodes instead of just getting and updating existing ones, thanks
[23:28:04] <verdoc> how would I find all "h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6" that are not descendants of div?
[23:29:01] <progrock`> $('h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6').filter(function() { return !$(this).parents('div).length });
[23:29:38] <krz> anyone: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9075417/how-to-detect-flash-and-prompt-to-install-with-plupload ?
[23:29:57] <verdoc> progrock`, whoa, that's much less obvious than I thought
[23:30:13] <verdoc> will that handle multiple levels?
[23:30:17] <progrock`> yes
[23:30:32] <progrock`> well css3 doesnt have parent seletors, unles I' mmistaken
[23:30:57] <progrock`> so yo uneed ot sleect all of them, then check if they have any parents that are a div, and filter out the ones that do
[23:31:33] <progrock`> oh, I forgot a quote around div
[23:31:40] <progrock`> but that should have been obvious
[23:31:46] <verdoc> yeah
[23:32:01] <progrock`> oh
[23:32:02] <progrock`> LOL
[23:32:05] <progrock`> I forgot the fukng commas
[23:32:06] <progrock`> hahahha
[23:32:12] <progrock`> 'h1, h1 ....'
[23:32:22] <progrock`> that should do it tho
[23:32:31] <verdoc> yeah, much better
[23:32:32] <verdoc> ;)
[23:33:12] <progrock`> you might be able to do:   $('h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6').not('div h1, div h2, div h3, div h4, div h5, div h6');
[23:33:18] <progrock`> but I like hte other way more
[23:34:42] <progrock`> btw thats checking ALL its parents.. . if you just wanted to make sure they are not a direct descendant, in the first example change parents to parent.. in the second need to add '>' between the div a h.. 'div > h1, div > h2, ....'
[23:35:16] <verdoc> dude, you have been most helpful
[23:35:38] <verdoc> I was just thinking that all parents was gonna be too much
[23:35:54] <progrock`> heh, jquery (among other libraries) are real powerful at selectors... doesnt take long to get a hag of them
[23:37:30] <verdoc> you mind if I include that snippet in a jquery-mobile patch?
[23:37:51] <progrock`> lol, of ocurse not, go for it.. just make sure it works, lol
[23:39:25] <progrock`> hmm, jst under 3k paycheck... prett sad I dont remmebr how many hours I worked the last 2 weeks.... god I wish I got the pretax number close to 5k
[23:41:51] <sennahoj> does anyone here now about an option, to store variables regarding an entity not solely in <input hiddenâ€¦> and instead in an "real" object storage?
[23:42:48] <progrock`> sennahoj: umm are yo utlaking about something like html5's data storage?.. ie  an attribut  data-.... ?
[23:43:09] <sennahoj> yeah found that on the api http://api.jquery.com/data/
[23:43:46] <progrock`> if that does the trick, then yea, I use it all the time
[23:43:49] <sennahoj> is it already ready for broad mass usage?
[23:44:00] <Cork> been for ages
[23:44:26] <Cork> data- isn't anything new, html5 just reserved the namespace
[23:44:38] <sennahoj> an you just choose your table cell or div tag you want the data attach to, and voila you can read it out?
[23:44:49] <progrock`> yup
[23:44:50] <Cork> yes
[23:45:14] <sennahoj> great, that's what I was searching for, perfect
[23:45:19] <progrock`> $('selectore').data()  to get all the data  ibeileive, or  ..data('key')  to get a specific key's data
[23:45:26] <sennahoj> thanks a lot guys
[23:46:00] <Cork> setting values through .data() doesn't update the data- attribute though
[23:46:25] <progrock`> Cork: well,if you;re using jquery to read it, thats irrelevant
[23:46:26] <Cork> jquery imports data- attributes into its internal data array
[23:46:47] <Cork> progrock`: not really, if you ex want to select on the data-my-key="value"
[23:46:50] <tdn> I am trying to get started using jquery, so I am trying the 'starterkit' tutorial on jquery.com. However, it does not work. I get "$ is not defined". My code is here: http://paste.adora.dk/P2303.html and here: http://paste.adora.dk/P2302.html     What am I doing wrong?
[23:49:31] <progrock`> tdn:  i'd recommend checkking ot jquery fundementals  e book
[23:49:49] <progrock`> wow monitr on this laptop is going crazy
[23:50:05] <progrock`> tdn: you need to includ ejquery in oder to use jquery...
[23:50:10] <progrock`> order*
[23:50:30] <eddiemonge> tdn you arent including the jquery script
[23:51:20] <eddiemonge> ?getting started @ tdn
[23:51:21] <bot-t> tdn, Tutorials:Getting Started with jQuery - Goes through the basics of jQuery, all the way up to building plugins. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[23:52:02] <progrock`> http://jqfundamentals.com/   thats what i reecommend rading
[23:54:19] <eddiemonge> thats actually not really being maintained anymore
[23:55:05] <mikesm> Cork: var url = 'http://oursite.local/index.php/viewApi/get/blocks/text';  				  				$.get(url, function(view){  					$(view).find('.textblock').html('testing')';  		});        //does not change 'view'. How do I do that?
[23:55:08] <tdn> eddiemonge, yes, that URL is the tutorial I am trying to get to work: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[23:55:12] <progrock`> eddiemonge: doesnt matter.. its fundamentals.. the only real thing he'll need is to get used to 'on' for events..
[23:55:19] <tdn> progrock`, is that one better than http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery ?
[23:55:33] <progrock`> I like the one I recommended, not that one
[23:55:38] <progrock`> but to each his own
[23:55:38] <tdn> progrock`, I do include jquery? Did you look at my code?
[23:55:44] <progrock`> tdn: didnt need to
[23:56:15] <tdn> progrock`, <script src="/jq-start/starterkit/jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[23:56:18] <progrock`> your not including jquery if $ is undefined... unless your fuckign around with noConflict, which i doubt
[23:56:19] <tdn> progrock`, please, have a look.
[23:56:20] <eddiemonge> tdn: i dont think you are including it correctly. if you view source on that page and then click on the js in the link does it take you to the js source?
[23:56:23] <Cork> mikesm: var $view = $(view); $view.find('.textblock').html('testing'); parent.append($view);
[23:57:12] <tdn> eddiemonge, thanks for the tip. It does give a 404. I will look into it.
[23:57:20] <eddiemonge> mikesm: that code is chaging .textblock, not view.
[23:57:49] <Cork> eddiemonge: it does change the view, but he's not saving it
[23:58:00] <Cork> view is a text variable
[23:58:52] <mikesm> aha, thanks Cork!
[23:58:56] <Cork> mikesm: $(view) parses the html text into a dom object wrapped in jquery; thats what find changes
[23:59:34] <Cork> so you need to store that object
[23:59:34] <Cork> and it should work fine
