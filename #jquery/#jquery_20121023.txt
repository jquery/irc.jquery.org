[00:00:05] <cgcardona> heh
[00:00:34] <Dr4g> this is the clear method so far btw guys: https://gist.github.com/cbda0d1889cc541ff304
[00:02:49] <Cork> Dr4g: that might be a bit problematic doing it that way
[00:02:58] <Cork> your generating quite a bit of memory garbage
[00:03:03] <Dr4g> i know
[00:03:13] <Cork> (with the map think that is)
[00:03:17] <Cork> *thing
[00:03:20] <MrDup> Hi
[00:03:26] <Dr4g> and the geoJson array is MASSIVE !!! it has coordinates for polygons
[00:03:54] <Dr4g> Cork how about i foreach() and get the first key and break out
[00:03:55] <MrDup> Is there somone who know a bit the jquery.form plugin ?
[00:04:18] <Dr4g> that'll only allocate memory for the first iteration, right ?
[00:05:11] <Cork> Dr4g: i think the best is prob to split things up a bit
[00:05:24] <Dr4g> Cork: have a separate map with just the keys in use, and iterate that?
[00:05:36] <Dr4g> separate object *
[00:05:40] <Cork> Dr4g: store the polygons in objects, and store them separately, then push them onto an array
[00:05:46] <Cork> thats prob faster and cleaner
[00:05:55] <Dr4g> Cork: i think we're thinking the same thing.
[00:05:58] <Dr4g> let me try it.
[00:09:02] <MrDup> I'm using the ajaxSubmit function with a form, but for server side programs, it seems that it's not recognized as an ajax request.
[00:09:42] <Cork> MrDup: does the server side check the http header?
[00:09:43] <MrDup> Someone knows anything about this ?
[00:10:00] <Cork> or how does it "recognize" it as ajax?
[00:11:44] <MrDup> I'm using the CodeIgniter framework wich uses the "HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH" property in a "is_ajax_request()" function.
[00:12:11] <Cork> MrDup: are you preventing the default submit action on the form?
[00:13:00] <MrDup> Cork: what do you mean by "preventing" ?
[00:13:24] <Cork> $('form').submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[00:13:32] <Dr4g> MrDup: you can ajax yourself, with a .submit() hook and a form.serialize() to get the data back :)
[00:14:23] <Dr4g> form.submit(function(e) {   e.preventDefault();   $.post(url, form.serialize(), functon(response) { … ajax response … } });
[00:14:30] <MrDup> Dr4g: effectively, but I'd like to know why this call of ajaxSubmit doesn't work as I want.
[00:14:44] <MrDup> It works perfectly in other calls in my app.
[00:14:54] <Dr4g> MrDup: okay man, good luck :)
[00:15:02] <MrDup> Thanks '-_-
[00:15:23] <MrDup> It's driving me insane for 3-4 days
[00:15:23] <Cork> MrDup: if your not blocking the original form submission the page will reload and the ajax call won't happen
[00:15:23] <MrDup> ^^
[00:15:35] <MrDup> Cork: oO
[00:15:40] <Cork> and if that doesn't help, you need to provide a demo of your problem
[00:15:40] <MrDup> Even with ajaxSubmit ?
[00:15:49] <Cork> ajaxSubmit??
[00:15:57] <Cork> ah, a plugin?
[00:16:09] <MrDup> Cork: I said it's from the jquery.form plugin
[00:16:14] <MrDup> Yep
[00:16:15] <Cork> ah
[00:16:52] <MrDup> I don't know if I'm in the good room for this question...
[00:17:04] <Dr4g> MrDup: if you weren't using a crap PHP framework then you wouldn't need to care if it was ajax or not :P
[00:17:13] <Dr4g> You have request headers, body. and get a response back
[00:17:21] <Dr4g> HTTP is HTTP
[00:18:56] <MrDup> Dr4g: You know, sometimes, you don't have choice...
[00:19:14] <Dr4g> MrDup: i know the feeling, I have to do CI and WP projects regularly
[00:19:22] <Dr4g> its totally lam
[00:19:24] <Dr4g> lame
[00:19:24] <MrDup> WP ?
[00:19:27] <Dr4g> wordpress
[00:19:30] <MrDup> Erf
[00:21:42] <MrDup> Dr4g: what header entry should I check to know if my request is ajax typed ?
[00:22:08] <Dr4g> "HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH"
[00:22:16] <Dr4g> $_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH"']
[00:22:16] <Cork> X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
[00:22:28] <Cork> php rewrites it a bit
[00:22:48] <Dr4g> yep, cork's is the raw HTTP header, but PHP will stick it into $_SERVER for you
[00:22:49] <Cork> uh, sorry apache :)
[00:23:09] <Cork> Dr4g: ya, i know
[00:23:27] <Dr4g> (that msg was for MrDup) :)
[00:23:37] <scar> i have a link that i want to check if a select box has a value before allowing the link to be accessed-- basically prevent the default action on a conditional basis. is this possible?
[00:23:42] <scar> by '
[00:23:49] <anli> I have the problem of $(function(){} to be called twice in my application
[00:24:03] <anli> Is there a chance anyone knows why?
[00:24:16] <anli> Is that because jquery is included multiply?
[00:24:20] <MrDup> Dr4g: okay, but as I said, the property is not set to this value.
[00:24:29] <Dr4g> MrDup: what is it set to ?
[00:24:31] <scar> by 'access', i mean 'clicked and followed through'--- say if its linked to google.com-- if a select box has no value, do SOMETHING _AND_ prevent default action of changing the browser location, ELSE allow the default action
[00:24:33] <Cork> scar: just check if the select elements val() == '', and if it is do event.preventDefault()
[00:24:39] <MrDup> Dr4g: I was going to check ;)
[00:25:00] <Cork> scar: remember that you need to handle this server side too
[00:25:02] <scar> Cork: does the A link not get processed IMMEDIATELY on click?
[00:25:10] <Cork> no
[00:25:40] <scar> Cork: ahh... i assumed i would have to on page load prevent the default A link, then on change select box if val !== '' then enable default
[00:25:45] <scar> Cork: what do you mean server side as well?
[00:25:47] <Cork> user clicks > all the click event handlers bound on the element > the event bubbles up the tree > default action happens
[00:25:55] <scar> ahhh
[00:26:02] <scar> good to know :)
[00:26:07] <scar> i dont see why server side though since its all dynamic
[00:26:08] <Cork> scar: that you need to handle when js is disabled
[00:26:12] <scar> ahh
[00:26:25] <Cork> security should never be in js only
[00:26:25] <scar> true true.
[00:26:49] <scar> if the link is clicked with a empty value.
[00:27:09] <scar> i can just have it redirect back and flag it im sure :)
[00:27:39] <scar> Cork: is 'event' a reserved var? or did you mean to use event as me to replace it
[00:27:55] <Cork> no its the first argument to the event handler
[00:28:03] <Cork> .click(function(event) {});
[00:28:06] <scar> i imagine i can use event.preventDefault() since itll be within a function
[00:28:11] <scar> ohhh
[00:28:12] <scar> ok
[00:28:24] <scar> learning quick but still new to the basics
[00:31:49] <MrDup> <p>Severity: Notice</p> <p>Message:  Undefined index: HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH</p>
[00:31:50] <MrDup> Okay
[00:31:54] <MrDup> Great...
[00:32:57] <Cork> so your don't getting an ajax call
[00:33:09] <Cork> or someting is removing the header (like a proxy)
[00:33:16] <MrDup> That's why I'm here
[00:33:25] <MrDup> Yes, I was reflecting about this
[00:33:29] <Cork> js doesn't set that header
[00:33:47] <MrDup> doesn't or cant' ?
[00:33:53] <MrDup> can't*
[00:34:00] <Cork> doesn't
[00:34:05] <Cork> the browser does that by default
[00:34:15] <MrDup> Okay
[00:34:22] <Cork> so if a browser does an ajax call that head is set
[00:34:52] <MrDup> So i'll try to print this variable in index to check it before CI could work on it
[00:36:32] <MrDup> Not defined at all
[00:37:13] <MrDup> Some other requests are working fine so it's probably due to my use of ajaxsubmit method
[00:37:14] <Cork> MrDup: your sure your doing an ajax call?
[00:37:20] <Cork> what does your browser console says?
[00:40:22] <MrDup> Cork: I'm using chrome, is the network tab displaying the request params as they're sent ?
[00:40:47] <Cork> MrDup: yes and it should show you the headers too
[00:41:47] <MrDup> Cork: it shows effectively that there's no "X-Requested-With" tag.
[00:43:00] <MrDup> I arrived to this conclusion before, but I can't understand why this damn header is not set correctly. ^^
[00:43:23] <Cork> hmm, need to check this
[00:44:55] <Cork> MrDup: you think you could generate a testcase?
[00:45:17] <Cork> just tested here and it works fine
[00:45:31] <Cork> (a live link would work too)
[00:47:18] <MrDup> Cork: nop, I can't do that :/ Confidential reasons essentially.
[00:47:41] <Cork> MrDup: ya, for the data
[00:47:52] <Cork> MrDup: but you could generate a demo on jsfiddle
[00:50:02] <MrDup> Cork: this function works perfectly in other calls, but here, there's some others things around, I think there's one that interract with a parameter of this function or something
[00:50:15] <MrDup> Do you know something about one ?
[00:50:35] <Cork> MrDup: i think its that your getting an iframe reload or similar
[00:50:47] <Cork> i don't think your getting a ajax call
[00:51:15] <Jerbot> How would you guys start to create a regex that took a *data\n from input and output <ul><li>data</li></ul>?
[00:51:20] <Jerbot> where would*
[00:51:48] <Muimi> I've done it before, but I can't find the code. XD
[00:53:25] <MrDup> Cork: I don't think so, there's no iframe in this app. I'll check before saying definately no. ^^
[00:57:51] <MrDup> Cork: Okay, i'm not sure about that, but it seems that the jquery.form plugin generates iframe tags dynamicaly.
[00:58:31] <Cork> ya, that doesn't surprise me
[00:59:41] <krz> if one executes a ajax call via $.get and then right after does window.location to redirect. will the ajax call finish before it redirects?
[01:02:42] <MrDup> krz: probably not, but you can use async property to wait until the ajax call returned something.
[01:04:02] <Tram> good moring all, I have a small problem. Iam using a object variable with templates in them. I target/log the whole object, but not a subpart. http://jsfiddle.net/uK2qT/  Does anyone knows what iam doing wrong?
[01:06:51] <Cork> Tram: you have an array of templates
[01:07:08] <Cork> so its templates[1].curriculaOption
[01:07:22] <Cork> and templates[0].CurriculaSelect
[01:07:22] <Tram> Ah ok, thanks
[01:07:43] <Tram> but is it possible to make 1 variable where i can get templates from by using .templatename?
[01:07:53] <Cork> don't use the array
[01:08:01] <xec_> Tram: maybe you wanted just the object literal? http://jsfiddle.net/uK2qT/1/
[01:08:40] <krz> MrDup: or i can do it in the after success callback
[01:08:47] <krz> of the $.get
[01:08:48] <Tram> Ya xec_ thanks
[01:08:55] <Tram> And thank you too Cork, again :D
[01:09:26] <Cork> krz: per defenition you don't do anything after the $.get call
[01:09:39] <Cork> krz: as it will happen when your function is done
[01:09:53] <Muimi> ooo ignored
[01:10:46] <CathaliN> how can I create a function to select the field "id" from JSON?
[01:11:02] <Cork> CathaliN: how long is a string?
[01:11:14] <Cork> CathaliN: that question is too generic
[01:12:13] <CathaliN> it's long
[01:12:19] <Cork> heh
[01:12:22] <CathaliN> the generated JSON has 200kb
[01:12:26] <Muimi> alright gtg.  gn
[01:12:42] <Cork> CathaliN: my point was you need to explain the structure of you json for anyone to be able to answer that question
[01:13:46] <MrDup> krz: Yep Cork is right, I didn't noticed you talked about get method, it's not the call that produce a ajax call.
[01:13:58] <CathaliN> Cork: http://pastebin.com/bPb6VJ7q
[01:13:59] <Cork> uh...
[01:14:01] <CathaliN> there is the JSON
[01:14:05] <Cork> MrDup: it is
[01:14:40] <MrDup> Cork: ah ? I missed something... ^^
[01:14:43] <BinaryKitten> CathaliN .. was line 1 a typo?
[01:15:11] <Cork> i hope it is
[01:15:24] <xec_> you mean line 2?
[01:15:29] <xec_> which is the entire thing
[01:15:29] <xec_> :D
[01:15:34] <Cork> beginning of line 2 ya
[01:15:45] <Cork> [{"Children":[{"Children":[{"Children": to be exact
[01:15:47] <MrDup> Cork: okey, I was on the get() method of DOMElements
[01:15:58] <BinaryKitten> i was more thinking about the empty line
[01:16:10] <BinaryKitten> which some json parsers will balk at
[01:16:46] <Cork> it will barf at [{"Children":[{"Children":[{"Children": too
[01:16:51] <Cork> cause that structure isn't closed
[01:16:59] <CathaliN> Cork: I have a treeview from that JSON... and when I select a node from the tree I want the id to be changed so that I can use it on a grid (the datasource of the grid is also a JSON, that needs the id parameter)
[01:17:17] <Cork> CathaliN: ya, but we need to correct json string
[01:17:24] <Cork> that one doens't even look valid
[01:17:49] <Cork> that data isn't important, its the structure that matters
[01:18:27] <xec_> this has multiple levels of objects inside arrays inside objects inside arrays, all with very generic names. a grid would usually be 1 array holding objects
[01:18:57] <BinaryKitten> CathaliN: this is how the system parses it.. http://pastebin.com/u8SwhHGA
[01:20:49] <Cork> BinaryKitten: you hit the size limit of pastebin :)
[01:21:10] <Cth> Cork: sorry.. net provider problems
[01:23:10] <BinaryKitten> Cork bah
[01:23:31] * BinaryKitten realises it's 09:30 and she needs to head to work..
[01:23:33] <CathaliN> Cork: that structure is something like folders and subfolders and files in Windows explorer
[01:23:53] <MrDup> Cork: okay, I have some other projects in standby, I'll resolve this later. Thanks a lot for your help ! :D
[01:24:02] <BinaryKitten> c:\Children\Children\Children\Children ???
[01:24:18] <Cork> CathaliN: so you would have to build a recursive lookup function to find all the elements
[01:24:35] <CathaliN> it is like that because the elements are in the alfabetical order
[01:24:53] <Cork> what does alfabetial order have to do with anything?
[01:25:08] <Cork> BinaryKitten> CathaliN: this is how the system parses it.. http://pastebin.com/u8SwhHGA <--
[01:25:14] <Cork> you have a very deep structure
[01:25:26] <Cork> and i can't really tell why you need it
[01:27:10] <CathaliN> is any possibility to get the "id"?
[01:27:25] <BinaryKitten> f which?
[01:27:34] <BinaryKitten> *of which?
[01:27:52] <Cork> yes, but you would have to do a quite complicated recursive lookup function
[01:27:54] <BinaryKitten> CathaliN are you generating this json in php?
[01:28:17] <boulet101010_> hh
[01:28:18] <CathaliN> BinaryKitten: no.. it's from C# with wcf services
[01:28:25] <BinaryKitten> ah
[01:28:31] <BinaryKitten> that explains a little more
[01:28:42] <Cork> ms loves complicated data structures :(
[01:28:55] <BinaryKitten> Cork don't they just
[01:29:09] * BinaryKitten doesn't know enouch C# to debug that
[01:29:45] <CathaliN> I'm using Kendo UI to generate the tree and also the grids
[01:29:59] <BinaryKitten> CathaliN can you limit the data set?
[01:30:07] <CathaliN> how?
[01:30:18] <BinaryKitten> eg can you tell it to only pull like 5 items at the lowest point?
[01:30:23] <BinaryKitten> (in the c#)
[01:30:42] <CathaliN> BinaryKitten: I think I can't
[01:31:04] <BinaryKitten> unfortunately then you're going to have to build a recursive function in js to parse it
[01:31:26] <BinaryKitten> there isn't any other choice and not much we (or mainly I in this statement) can do to help
[01:31:34] <CathaliN> the grid needs in his datasource the parameter from the tree node
[01:32:46] <CathaliN> I declared that parameter as global variable.. and I want that when I select a node from the tree, the grid to be refreshed with the new data according to the selected "id"
[01:33:02] <CathaliN> sourceUrl = "http://10.11.30.201/emmSysSVC.svc/json/indexes?idSemnal=3&idContor=" + meterid;
[01:33:21] <CathaliN> the "meterid" is from the treeview
[01:33:22] <Tram> I want to make a if statement that checks if some specific dom element exists. Does anyone know how i can check for a empty/full object? Is  it just == []?
[01:34:09] <Tram> CathaliN: sourceUrl = function(){return 'link'+var}
[01:35:35] <CathaliN> Cork: any idea?
[01:35:38] <BinaryKitten> Tram your Q is a little vague and asking many things
[01:35:52] <Cork> CathaliN: http://jsfiddle.net/5UnQB/
[01:36:04] <BinaryKitten> Tram: empty dom element $(selector).children().length == 0
[01:36:21] <BinaryKitten> Tram:  dom element doesn't exist $(selector).length == 0
[01:36:31] <Tram> thanks!
[01:36:47] <computer2000> js basic question: how can i determine, if a function which can receive two arguments has received only the first or the second one?
[01:36:49] <BinaryKitten> Tram:  object doesn't exist (typeof object == 'undefined')
[01:37:03] <BinaryKitten> Tram: object empty (object.length = 0)
[01:37:34] <BinaryKitten> computer2000 you can't receive only the 2nd
[01:37:57] <computer2000> BinaryKitten: really? oh man. ok
[01:37:59] <computer2000> thx
[01:38:04] <BinaryKitten> if you want to check to see if the 2nd param has been passed   .. use the object doesn't exist i sent toi tram
[01:38:19] <Cork> computer2000: alternatively arguemnts.length
[01:38:29] <computer2000> Cork: that would work
[01:38:29] <Cork> *arguments.length
[01:38:30] <Tram> thanks alot BinaryKitten!
[01:39:54] <BinaryKitten> right i really must go to the office now
[01:39:57] <CathaliN> Cork: http://pastebin.com/0KPQFxTg
[01:40:26] <CathaliN> I can't add "var jsobject ="
[01:40:45] <CathaliN> maybe can I replace it with datatree from my code?
[01:41:48] <Cork> CathaliN: that depends on what kendo.data.HierarchicalDataSource generates
[01:41:49] <BinaryKitten> does bind suppoprt that methodology?
[01:42:07] <CathaliN> yes
[01:42:13] <Cork> no
[01:42:18] <Cork> thats on
[01:42:20] <Cork> not bind
[01:42:25] <Cork> or delegate
[01:43:01] <jomofcw> Hello Cork :).
[01:43:06] <Cork> o/
[01:43:31] <CathaliN> Cork: url: "http://10.11.30.201/emmSysSVC.svc/json/retele" is the JSON that you saw it before
[01:43:50] <CathaliN> It reads that url and gives me the tree
[01:44:04] <Cork> thats a local ip
[01:44:09] <CathaliN> yes
[01:44:09] <Cork> CathaliN: but just test
[01:44:16] <Cork> i can't access your local ip :)
[01:44:35] <CathaliN> I know.. but I gived to you the generated JSON for that url
[01:44:56] <Cork> CathaliN: just test the function and see if it generates what you need
[01:45:27] <CathaliN> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined
[01:45:36] <CathaliN> that's what I receive in console
[01:45:50] <Cork> you need to pass the structure to the function
[01:45:55] <Cork> else it can look in it
[01:46:10] <CathaliN> can I replace jsobject with datatree ?
[01:46:31] <Cork> its an argument to the function, just pass your object to it
[01:46:35] <jomofcw> Using $form.on('change','input, select, textarea',function(){}); what is "this" in the function plz ? The form ? Or the "input" ?
[01:46:52] <Cork> the input
[01:47:02] <Cork> or rather input seelct or textarea
[01:47:07] <Cork> ?.delegate
[01:47:08] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[01:47:10] <jomofcw> OK thanks Cork
[01:47:56] <jomofcw> Cork to be sure : in on method selector and eventType is "reverse" ?
[01:48:08] <jomofcw> .on(eventType, selector, handler)
[01:48:22] <Cork> ?.on
[01:48:23] <bot-t> Cork, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:48:26] <Cork> ---'
[01:48:29] <jomofcw> xD
[01:48:34] <Cork> jomofcw: just look in the api docs
[01:48:41] <jomofcw> yup OK ty ;).
[01:48:55] <Tobsn> anyone an idea how the google web optimizer replaces those areas?
[01:49:00] <Tobsn> <script>func('areaname')</script>default content</noscript> thats how you set it up - how would they replace the area between script end and noscript?
[01:49:11] <CathaliN> Cork: I replaced "jsobject" to "datatree" and the result is: []
[01:49:41] <Cork> by replace you mean you replaced in the function call right?
[01:49:48] <Cork> not all the other demo uses of it?
[01:49:55] <Tobsn> replace "default content" with variations you set up
[01:50:07] <Tobsn> oh wrong person
[01:50:08] <Tobsn> ;)
[01:50:23] <CathaliN> findIds(datatree, list); .. here.
[01:50:38] <Cork> ok, then your data structure isn't what you sent before
[01:51:26] <CathaliN> why not? the datatree reads the url
[01:51:53] <Cork> donno, but the data structure you gave is whats in the jsfiddle
[01:51:56] <Cork> and it works there
[01:54:49] <CathaliN> and why the list is empty?
[01:55:12] <Cork> cause it doesn't find any id's cause the structure is different
[01:55:43] <Noeble> question: I have a page using the AHAH teqhnique. Problem is that when I populate an element with new html ( which works fine ) it cant use the already loaded jquery scripts. Anyone know the best way to solve this?
[01:59:34] <CathaliN> damn.. :(
[02:00:05] <Cork> CathaliN: ex. your sure that it generates a javascript object and not a string?
[02:01:55] <CathaliN> the services generates that JSON
[02:02:10] <CathaliN> and the tree is generated by that JSON
[02:02:27] <CathaliN> the tree is working
[02:02:40] <CathaliN> it gives me all the nodes.. without any problem
[02:20:20] <klj613> on ajax call. the error handler.  how do i check if jqXHR.responseText is json?
[02:22:41] <benjick> Hey. I'm looking for something jquery for iphone/ipad so I can swipe between pages
[02:23:34] <faraway> benjick: jquerymobile ?
[02:25:41] <PBDev> why cab't I join the php channel?
[02:25:50] <PBDev> why can't I join the php channel?
[02:26:21] <benjick> PBDev: identify
[02:26:24] <benjick> faraway: thanks
[02:26:35] <PBDev> what?
[02:28:03] <PBDev> how do you identify?
[02:28:46] <benjick> /msg nickserv help
[02:31:38] <krz> PBDev: join the rails channel
[02:32:15] <PBDev> is rails channel php?
[02:32:39] <PBDev> just tried php identify. it says: can not send to channel
[02:33:28] <jammanbo> Im using the twitter bootstrap popover plugin. Say I do $('#something').popover(…). Is it possible to override one of the methods added by bootstrap but only for this particular use? I mean, if I create a popover elsewhere on the page I want it to be unaffected by the override.
[02:35:40] <PBDev> I still can not join the php channel
[02:36:33] <PBDev> it says I can not send to channel! Not even the identification parameters. So username and password fails
[02:37:00] <faraway> PBDev: you don't need to send to the channel to authenicate
[02:37:14] <PBDev> what do I type then
[02:37:19] <PBDev> I checked the help thingy
[02:37:36] <PBDev> it says to type identify username and password
[02:37:50] <adam007> hello i want load form after im insert data, the loaded form can insert to another table but use id the table before
[02:38:42] <Cork> PBDev: is your nick registered?
[02:38:45] <PBDev> this is really annoying
[02:38:57] <PBDev> yeah I think I did that before
[02:39:00] <Cork> then try /j ##php
[02:39:04] <PBDev> however tell me so I do it again
[02:40:19] <PBDev> how do I register?
[02:40:42] <Cork> /ns help register
[02:42:03] <PBDev> yep, it says it is already registered
[02:42:22] <krz> PBDev: or: "/quit and stick to Skype" without the quotes
[02:43:30] <PBDev> well?
[02:43:41] <seutje> jammanbo: you seem to be able to get a reference to the popover object by using $('.trigger').data('popover')
[02:44:03] <seutje> jammanbo: you could then fuck with it's constructor, but u'll prolly have to clone ur own and fuck with that instead
[02:46:33] <adam007> greek go to #css
[02:46:41] <adam007> hello i want load form after im insert data, the loaded form can insert to another table but use id the table before
[02:47:26] <adam007> Naktibalda im use this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8185183/write-form-data-to-mysql-without-page-refresh but after i insert in bottom show another form to insert to another table
[02:47:33] <jammanbo> seutje: Ah. Thanks for the tip.
[02:47:38] <PBDev> its not working. How do I identify without sending?
[02:50:28] <seutje> PBDev: it looks like you already registered
[02:50:33] <seutje> just not identified right now
[02:50:50] <PBDev> yeah i have. And it tells me I need to identify.
[02:50:53] <PBDev> I try to identfiy
[02:51:01] <PBDev> but then it says it can not send
[02:51:10] <seutje> and last time you identified was 4 weeks and 6 days ago
[02:51:13] <PBDev> probably because I havent identified...lol
[02:51:17] <seutje> uhm, how are you trying to identify?
[02:51:22] <blackspotwiggins> PBDev, you dont identify to the channel ffs
[02:51:30] <blackspotwiggins> are you messaging nickserv
[02:51:35] <seutje> just go /ns help identify
[02:51:51] <abletony84> How do I get this dropdown form working with variables to make things more clear? http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/cN5RE/2/
[02:51:54] <abletony84> var newform = $(".new-form"); and then later $(this).newform, or how does it work?
[02:52:22] <seutje> why u gotta link to a dead page?
[02:52:28] <seutje> not cool
[02:54:37] <PBDev> this is really annoying. I used this Syntax: IDENTIFY <password>
[02:54:55] <PBDev> so I just type identify, I type my password, and I press enter, it aint working lol
[02:55:29] <abletony84> seutje: oh shit, sorry man !!
[02:55:34] <abletony84> now:
[02:55:39] <PBDev> why is this so difficult
[02:55:42] <abletony84> How do I get this dropdown form working with variables to make things more clear? http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/cN5RE/2/
[02:55:45] <abletony84> var newform = $(".new-form"); and then later $(this).newform, or how does it work?
[02:55:54] <PBDev> I am doing exactly as it says and it doesn't work!
[02:57:01] <blackspotwiggins> how can you fail at irc..
[02:57:02] <blackspotwiggins> srsly
[02:57:13] <seutje> PBDev: read, don't skim, it has examples at the end: /msg NickServ IDENTIFY jilles foo
[02:57:24] <seutje> the "/msg NickServ" is quite crucial
[02:57:38] <seutje> otherwise you're just going "HEY GUYS THIS IS MY PASSWORD: ..."
[02:58:09] <seutje> (using "/ns" is a shortcut for /msg nickserv, also considered safer)
[02:58:58] <adam007> hello how to load another page after sucses inserting data via php ?
[02:59:31] <PBDev> it says I am already logged in
[02:59:51] <PBDev> but I still can not send anything
[03:00:31] <PBDev> this is propesterous
[03:00:41] <PBDev> nothing works!
[03:00:50] <seutje> now it says ur logged in
[03:00:59] <PBDev> yes
[03:01:21] <PBDev> but still, members listed on the left. seems like an empty channel. and I can send to channel
[03:01:31] <seutje> a second ago, it said ur last login was over 4 weeks ago
[03:01:33] <PBDev> I meant NO MEMBERS LISTED on the left
[03:02:00] <PBDev> you in the channel?
[03:02:02] <adam007> seutje sorry can you help me ?
[03:02:23] <PBDev> the channel name is #php right?
[03:02:24] <abletony84> adam007: sorry can u help me?
[03:02:49] <abletony84> got my boss breathing down my neck here somebody please
[03:02:49] <seutje> PBDev: isn't #php invite only?
[03:02:55] <adam007> abletony84 why ?
[03:03:09] <abletony84> adam007: why i need help?
[03:03:11] <adam007> PBDev join to ##php
[03:03:12] <seutje> abletony84: what exactly is this suppose to do?
[03:03:19] <PBDev> if it invite only, how do heck am I supposed to used it. someone invite me.
[03:03:27] <abletony84> seutje: just to slide down this form when you press its above button..
[03:03:30] <PBDev> what is this invite only bs!
[03:03:47] <abletony84> seutje: Working version: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/cN5RE/
[03:04:05] <abletony84> just trying to put in some variables there to make it more DRY or whatever
[03:04:07] <PBDev> finanly I made it into ##php
[03:04:13] <PBDev> this was so freaking  annoying
[03:04:37] <PBDev> I had needed help on many things regarding php, and couldnt for such a long time
[03:04:40] <seutje> abletony84: yeah, that new form button, can't rly make it a variable, aside from just sticking that string into a variable
[03:04:52] <PBDev> and I dare not asked a php question in another channel cause they refused
[03:04:55] <seutje> it has to be a string cause it gets checked when the event fires, not when u bind it
[03:05:26] <seutje> abletony84: newform also can't be a variable outside of that handler's scope, as it needs to be relative to the button being clicked
[03:05:47] <abletony84> seutje: if you check out the OLDER WORKING EXAMPLE at http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/cN5RE/3/ - thats basically what im trying to achieve..
[03:06:00] <abletony84> seutje: hmm..
[03:06:34] <seutje> abletony84: I'd prolly change it to this and leave it at that: http://jsfiddle.net/cN5RE/4/
[03:06:55] <seutje> depending on the complexity of the application and how often u'd reuse this exact same pattern
[03:08:22] <seutje> abletony84: or maybe like this, so you can easily add triggers: http://jsfiddle.net/cN5RE/5/
[03:08:32] <abletony84> hmmm
[03:09:01] <abletony84> cool
[03:09:05] <abletony84> seutje: there will never be multiple triggers though
[03:09:09] <seutje> maybe do the same for the wrapper, so you could abstract it to a plugin to which u only pass a set of triggers and respective containers
[03:09:29] <seutje> yeah, like I said, depends on the application if it's worth it
[03:09:43] <abletony84> seutje: the difference between the OLD WORKING EXAMPLE and the NEW NON-WORKING EXAMPLE is that the new one will better handle multiple forms on the same page
[03:09:48] <abletony84> seutje: i sincerely appreciate this man
[03:09:49] <abletony84> thanks a lot
[03:10:56] <abletony84> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/cN5RE/4/ looks pretty much the same as http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/cN5RE/ though?
[03:11:31] <seutje> abletony84: well, I didn't repeat $(this) :P
[03:11:32] <abletony84> basically im trying to get a "config section" above the code where i can specify the class of the button as well as the class of the form that's suppose to slide down.. because these will vary from case to case
[03:11:37] <abletony84> "new form dropdown"
[03:11:47] <abletony84> sory
[03:11:51] <abletony84> "new post form dropdown"
[03:11:53] <seutje> abletony84: and to keep the ability to handle multiple forms, is exactly the reason I kept it relative to the trigger
[03:12:01] <abletony84> "new user form dropdown", "recover user password form dropdown" etc.
[03:12:17] <seutje> abletony84: that's exactly what I was saying with abstracting the trigger and wrapper
[03:12:22] <abletony84> oh okay.. cool
[03:12:30] <seutje> but will it always have to travel up to the form first?
[03:13:23] <abletony84> seutje: im not sure..
[03:13:40] <abletony84> seutje: it doesnt need to do that to handle multiple forms in one page?
[03:14:16] <seutje> abletony84: well, it helps to have a unified way of getting from trigger X to the wrapper that should open up upon clicking it
[03:14:34] <seutje> as in, the .closest('form').nextAll(x) thing
[03:14:54] <adam007> please anyone can help me ? :(
[03:16:12] <abletony84> hmm.. yeah
[03:16:30] <abletony84> seutje: am i on the right path here? http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/cN5RE/7/
[03:16:51] <seutje> abletony84: I guess
[03:16:55] <computer2000> json question: how can i access myJSON.child.child
[03:17:24] <abletony84> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/cN5RE/8/ nope it broke im afraid
[03:17:44] <abletony84> seutje: im just trying to make the code clearer and more understandable to non-technical people like myself
[03:17:46] <seutje> oh lol
[03:17:53] <seutje> newform variable is the button, not the wrapper
[03:18:00] <abletony84> yes!
[03:18:03] <seutje>  but frankly, considering the markup you have, you can just use next()
[03:18:04] <abletony84> thats right :)
[03:18:48] <abletony84> uhm
[03:19:30] <abletony84> no newform is the wrapper sorry
[03:19:42] <abletony84> http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/cN5RE/9/
[03:21:28] <seutje> ugh, these captcha things with dead links are throwing annoying errors :/
[03:23:19] <Palanivel> hi hi..........am using UI date picker in my form but it's allowing user to edit the date...........
[03:23:28] <Palanivel> how to restrict
[03:23:50] <Palanivel> am make that field as readonly
[03:24:35] <Palanivel> but some times user force fully pressed any of the key means ...that date picker value is changes
[03:24:52] <Palanivel> can any one help me if u known
[03:25:00] <seutje> abletony84: how's this? http://jsfiddle.net/cN5RE/11/
[03:25:19] <abletony84> seutje: sorry that looks very messy
[03:26:12] <abletony84> im just looking to put two simple vars on top there.. no need for a whole trigger array and all that advanced stuff
[03:36:20] <DarsVaeda> hi, on my page I open a jquery ui dialog and in this dialog there is a scrollbar when I close the dialog and open another the scrollbar is not working anymore, I have to strg+R to get it working again
[03:36:36] <DarsVaeda> is this that scrollbar bug I read about everywhere or my fault?
[03:40:26] <Cork> DarsVaeda: do you have a link?
[03:40:43] <DarsVaeda> no it's a backend :(
[03:40:58] <DarsVaeda> it works in firefox
[03:41:11] <DarsVaeda> and I guess IE but not too sure
[03:41:13] <Cork> the scrollbar is just native overflow: auto
[03:41:31] <Cork> so its not js related, so its prob something else happening
[03:41:34] <DarsVaeda> yes and it is scrolled all the way down and I can not scroll it
[03:41:53] <Cork> its the can't scroll thats prob something else like i said
[03:42:03] <DarsVaeda> hmm okay
[03:42:18] <Cork> if you can reproduce it in jsfiddle it would help a lot
[03:42:38] <DarsVaeda> I'll try to set one up if the time allows
[03:46:24] <DarsVaeda> ahh it is some kind of focus error, if I click on some element like a textbox in the dialog then I'm able to scroll again
[03:46:26] <mazzachre> What is the difference between $(this).find([selector]) and $([selector], $(this)) ???
[03:47:49] <rsmarshall> hey all, quick question for you. :) I have the following code http://pastie.org/5102899. I want to only run the logged_in check and resulting code if all ajax requests have completed. Is there a way to do that?
[03:49:41] <mazzachre> rsmarshall: Via defferds
[03:51:01] <mazzachre> rsmarshall: You would probably need to make your own deffered though, and add each ajax deffered to it, only resolving it when every added ajax is done
[03:51:51] <Drager> Anyone know a open source code for inserting bbtags into a textarea? [b][/b] and so on
[03:52:14] <mazzachre> Drager: Google might know one
[03:52:52] <Drager> mazzachre: Yeah, no idea what to google for, tried it but didnt find any
[03:52:58] <Kcko> <mazzachre> What is the difference between $(this).find([selector]) and $([selector], $(this)) ???     none
[03:53:21] <Kcko> the second does in fact the first
[03:53:27] <mazzachre> Drager: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=open+source+bbtags+jquery ?
[03:54:44] <mazzachre> Kcko: ok, thx... I could not see a difference, but there might be something subtle I might have missed...
[03:57:11] <Drager> mazzachre: No good results.
[03:58:12] <mazzachre> Drager: Then probably no... If google can't find it, it does not exist :D
[03:58:50] <Drager> Haha
[04:10:08] <Miika--> Hello, can I somehow set data-mini="true" by default for all elements? (without js)
[04:11:11] <Miika--> I found github issue / feature request on this, but is it implemented yet?
[04:16:04] <rsmarshall> mazzachre thanks, i'll do some reading

[04:24:26] <pedda> hi there
[04:24:31] <soul_sucker> hi
[04:24:37] <soul_sucker> what are you doing guys ?
[04:24:44] <pedda> can someone share some resources on using math for animations ?
[04:24:55] <soul_sucker> what do you mean pedda ?
[04:25:40] <pedda> some examples which math formulas can be used to make nice animations
[04:25:50] <pedda> i have a slideshow
[04:26:02] <pedda> in which each slide hase a horizontal movement
[04:26:02] <anli> jquery.easing.js is used for that
[04:26:19] <pedda> and i'm kinde stuck with the proper timing
[04:26:37] <pedda> the horizontal movement is achieved by amplitude * Math.sin(frame.time * 2 * Math.PI / period) + centerX
[04:26:47] <Tobsn> http://jsfiddle.net/3y8YA/8/ - anyone a better idea? ;)
[04:27:11] <computer2000> help please with json: http://pastebin.com/wrHvfqQm - need to read out breakpoints.small ... how do i do this?
[04:27:14] <pedda> i just wanted to know if there is a resource where i can read about using such calculations in jquery
[04:28:37] <pedda> i would need you to explain the details to solve my timing problem… but my question was just for some resources to read about mathematics for animations
[04:30:09] <pedda> found some on smashingmag.
[04:30:12] <pedda> :)
[04:31:50] <sylock> hello guys. I want to create a loop to query at some intervals an url that give me back a json. I need to wait for a certain value in it then execute another function.
[04:32:28] <sylock> I firstly started to write a while(true) and wanting to put something like sleep but it seems that javascript doesn't really support sleep or wait since its multi-threaded
[04:32:49] <sylock> is someone have an ide?
[04:33:08] <seutje> abletony84: uhm, ok, I used 1 variable instead of 2, which would seem simpler, but suit urself
[04:33:25] <Tobsn> sylock var yourtimer = setInterval(function(){ do something if okay clearInterval(yourtimer)})
[04:33:36] <Tobsn> sylock var yourtimer = setInterval(function(){ do something if okay clearInterval(yourtimer)}, 500 )
[04:35:02] <Tobsn> var yourtimer;yourtimer = setInterval(function(){ do something if okay clearInterval(yourtimer)}, 500 );
[04:35:07] <Tobsn> that way it should work iirc
[04:35:40] <sylock> Tobsn: thank. I'll try it
[04:36:01] <Tobsn> dont set the interval too low - its in miliseconds
[04:36:15] <sylock> ok
[04:36:21] <Tobsn> and build in a break
[04:36:27] <Tobsn> after X tries, clear interval anyway
[04:36:53] <Tobsn> clear interval anyway and reload the page or something like that
[04:37:48] <sylock> do I need to reload the page when I get a "timeout" ?
[04:37:56] <sylock> only break the loop isn't ok?
[04:39:26] <sylock> There is something I never really understood : which is the best way to test/debug javascript?
[04:39:46] <sylock> currently, I'm often use the method : change & trry
[04:39:48] <sylock> try*
[04:39:50] <sylock> ^^
[04:42:08] <Cork> sylock: debug outputs are normally the best way
[04:42:18] <Cork> console.log(value you want to know about)
[04:44:46] <Jax> hello, i'm looking for something like this, does anybody know a decent hierarchical checkbox component? http://static.geewax.org/checktree/index.html
[04:46:26] <Cork> Jax: look at one of the different tree view widgets
[04:47:02] <Cork> Jax: ex. http://www.jqwidgets.com/jquery-tree-with-checkboxes/
[04:47:40] <Cork> and another one http://code.google.com/p/checkboxtree/
[04:49:40] <Tobsn> does anyone know how to tell jsfiddle to not wrap coffeescript into a function?
[04:50:36] <seutje> Tobsn: put it in the HTML tab
[04:50:44] <Tobsn> hmm?
[04:50:46] <seutje> Tobsn: even regular JS gets wrapped in a window load iirc
[04:51:38] <Tobsn> nah when it compiles it by default wrapps it into the a annoymous (function(){}) which defines function not global
[04:51:48] <Tobsn> and if i set window.myfunc -> it still isnt global
[04:54:21] <Tobsn> i cant seem to be able to access window
[04:55:03] <sylock> Cork: cool. I didn't know console.log :)
[05:03:50] <Tobsn> seutje, http://jsfiddle.net/tobsn/qkPCJ/5/
[05:03:51] <Tobsn> see
[05:04:03] <Tobsn> * http://jsfiddle.net/tobsn/qkPCJ/6/
[05:04:37] <seutje> Tobsn: what am I looking at?
[05:04:42] <Tobsn> see console
[05:04:49] <Tobsn> this. is the global scope
[05:04:53] <Tobsn> see "show js" at the top
[05:05:12] <Tobsn> i can't get myfunc() to go into the global scope
[05:05:49] <Cork> Tobsn: where are you defining that function?
[05:05:57] <Tobsn> hmm?
[05:06:02] <Tobsn> right there
[05:06:08] <Tobsn> see on the left
[05:06:11] <Tobsn> "in head"
[05:06:31] <Cork> ah coffie
[05:06:33] <seutje> Tobsn: it is in the global scope
[05:06:41] <seutje> Tobsn: it's just not defined untill window load
[05:06:44] <seutje> until*
[05:06:52] <Tobsn> any fixes for that?
[05:07:51] <seutje> ugh, why is there a DTD and a head and shit in the html tab?
[05:08:02] <Tobsn> just remove the html
[05:08:04] <Tobsn> i just tested around
[05:08:10] <Tobsn> http://jsfiddle.net/tobsn/qkPCJ/8/
[05:08:44] <Cork> Tobsn: i suspect its your dependency on coffie that causes that
[05:08:53] <Tobsn> yeah i think so too
[05:08:54] <Cork> it needs to rewrite the script
[05:09:00] <Cork> http://fiddle.jshell.net/qkPCJ/7/show/
[05:09:14] <Cork> if that was plain js that should have worked
[05:09:35] <Tobsn> ah man
[05:09:36] <Tobsn> this sucks
[05:09:40] <Tobsn> i was suspecting that
[05:09:50] <Tobsn> yeah the JS versionw works just fine
[05:09:57] <Cork> i don't really get the hype over coffiescript but anyway
[05:10:04] <Tobsn> me neither
[05:10:07] <Tobsn> i was just messing around
[05:10:12] <Tobsn> but i like the writing style
[05:10:19] <Cork> i don't really
[05:10:57] <Tobsn> if you get used to it, you write faster or rather you need to focus less because if's are more expressive
[05:14:11] <abletony84> seutje: but it consists of two elements - the button and the form
[05:14:25] <abletony84> seutje: like they say "perfection is achieved, not when there's nothing left to add, but when there's nothing left to take away"
[05:14:43] <abletony84> seutje: in this spirit, i would prefer simpler code even if it means an extra variable, rather than smarter but more compressed and unreadable code
[05:15:23] <seutje> abletony84: lol whatever
[05:16:08] <seutje> ugh, forgot coffeescript's identation matters
[05:16:48] <seutje> Tobsn: yeah, screw this, gl
[05:16:52] <Tobsn> yeah
[05:16:52] <Tobsn> http://jsfiddle.net/tobsn/qkPCJ/
[05:17:09] <Tobsn> i mean it works... just thought i give CS a try, which would work if it wouldnt be inline parsing
[05:17:55] <seutje> don't u think it's kinda silly to have broken markup and then fix it conditionally?
[05:18:22] <Cork> and document.write is a plague from the past that shouldn't be used at all
[05:18:38] <Tobsn> seutje, thats how google web optimizer does it
[05:18:42] <seutje> yeah, that even more than all
[05:18:45] <Tobsn> i just tried to find out if THEIR crap actually works ;)
[05:19:08] <Tobsn> seutje, the idea is that broken markup is better than a fatal JS error
[05:19:23] <Cork> Tobsn: don't use googles pages as a prof of how things should work
[05:19:29] <Tobsn> not pages
[05:19:32] <seutje> neither seems a way I'd want to go
[05:19:32] <Tobsn> web optimizer
[05:19:35] <Tobsn> it works pretty well
[05:19:38] <Tobsn> well
[05:19:40] <Tobsn> i asked before
[05:19:44] <Cork> just look at google groups that fetches feeds through syncronus ajax calls :s
[05:19:45] <Tobsn> any other solutions that might be better?
[05:20:04] <Cork> Tobsn: fix it server side before hand
[05:20:07] <Tobsn> fork it and see if theres a better way to include a default into noscript
[05:20:12] <Tobsn> cant be server side
[05:20:20] <Tobsn> has to work the same GWO works
[05:20:22] <Cork> theres your base problem then
[05:20:23] <Tobsn> remote js
[05:20:24] <seutje> I don't even get what ur trying to do
[05:20:35] <seutje> what does this optimize?
[05:20:48] <Tobsn> its a multi variation test
[05:20:57] <Tobsn> you'd set up sections and define different content
[05:21:05] <Tobsn> the noscript part is the default if JS is off
[05:21:12] <Tobsn> and the other variations are served through google
[05:21:24] <Tobsn> you basically define within google title is this or this or that
[05:21:27] <Tobsn> and it will rotate
[05:21:36] <Tobsn> conversion tracking then determines which combination is the best
[05:21:41] <Tobsn> see my example
[05:21:49] <Tobsn> it pretty much does that in the most dumb way as an example
[05:22:51] <Tobsn> so if the browser has JS on and the script isnt returning anything or is faulty it would display the default
[05:23:09] <Tobsn> if something is there to replace it would run the JS and inject the <noscript> to remove the default
[05:23:17] <Tobsn> if js in the browser is completely off, the default kicks in again
[05:23:33] <Tobsn> i think thats why theyre doing it, its a failover
[05:23:51] <Tobsn> now if you know a better way, let me know :)
[05:25:38] <seutje> so when js is off, there's this useless tag floating around and when JS is on, this bit needs to be placed exactly there or it'll fail horribly
[05:25:44] <seutje> those are the requirements?
[05:27:08] <Tobsn> the requirement is that the default text is visible if JS browser side is off, the default content is shown if the remotely included JS fails (for whatever reason, server down etc.) and if JS runs and it is valid it replaces the content right under the function
[05:27:17] <Tobsn> those are the requirements
[05:27:37] <blackspotwiggins> <noscript> ?
[05:27:39] <Tobsn> and you can see for doing this with this method, you dont need much JS
[05:27:52] <Tobsn> and a dead floating html tag isnt such a big deal for a browser
[05:28:07] <Tobsn> esp if its </noscript> inside the body, it wouldnt care much
[05:28:12] <seutje> Tobsn: you can't remotely include the js in your example
[05:28:24] <Tobsn> sure
[05:28:28] <Tobsn> js into the head
[05:28:34] <Tobsn> thats parsed before body
[05:28:35] <seutje> just remove it and see
[05:28:42] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, can you show an example of what he's talking about?
[05:28:53] <Tobsn> http://jsfiddle.net/tobsn/qkPCJ/
[05:29:03] <Tobsn> blackspotwiggins, thats how google web optimizer handles the replacment of dyn content
[05:29:22] <blackspotwiggins> wait wat
[05:29:29] <blackspotwiggins> you are using js to add <noscript>
[05:29:33] <seutje> tighly coupled inline js
[05:29:34] <Tobsn> not me
[05:29:36] <Tobsn> thats what they do
[05:29:47] <Tobsn> i just tried out of that actually works
[05:29:54] <Tobsn> and it seems like its a pretty clever solution
[05:29:58] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: the closing tags are in the source like, always
[05:30:03] <Tobsn> yep hehe
[05:30:07] <Tobsn> http://dev.eek.be/2010/12/testing-dynamic-content-with-google-website-optimizer/
[05:30:11] <Tobsn> example, how people used it
[05:30:16] <Tobsn> you see example code of GWO
[05:30:27] <Tobsn> http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.google.com/en//websiteoptimizer/techieguide.pdf
[05:30:35] <Tobsn> heres the techie guide from google on it
[05:31:33] <blackspotwiggins> huh
[05:31:34] <blackspotwiggins> weird
[05:31:37] <seutje> it seems like it's dirty as fuck as rather fragile :x
[05:31:43] <Tobsn> yep
[05:31:51] <seutje> s/as/and
[05:32:06] <Tobsn> well it seems to work for them
[05:32:07] <seutje> "very easy to set up"
[05:32:11] <Tobsn> and its not like nobody used that tool
[05:32:16] <seutje> I chuckled there
[05:32:17] <blackspotwiggins> would it not be easy to just replace <noscript> with something else?
[05:32:55] <Tobsn> hehe "Google Website Optimizer is built on robust, enterprise-grade technology"
[05:32:55] <blackspotwiggins> or not even replace, just add the relevant stuff
[05:33:11] <Tobsn> you want to replace for the testing
[05:33:23] <Tobsn> replace if it can be replaced, leave default if something breaks
[05:33:29] <seutje> that's crazy, who'd want to maintain a system that has decoupled content and behaviors?
[05:33:42] <seutje> surely you want all this shit in a single file where the order matters
[05:33:46] <Tobsn> so if all is valid and okay, it injects the test content + the starting noscript which turns off the default
[05:34:05] <Tobsn> seutje, i tell you, HUGE companies used that shit like crazy
[05:34:16] <Tobsn> think of any big site, they tried it out to optimize
[05:34:22] <seutje> HUGE companies also use ad scripts that fuck with my prototypes
[05:34:26] <Tobsn> hehe
[05:34:28] <Tobsn> true
[05:34:36] <seutje> HUGE companies employ children for barely any compensation
[05:34:39] <Tobsn> wanna see something else?
[05:34:40] <Tobsn> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5033474/google-website-optimiser-control-javascript
[05:34:43] <Tobsn> thats how they load it
[05:34:48] <seutje> HUGE companies are hardly a reference
[05:34:49] <Tobsn> look at the two empty functions
[05:34:51] <blackspotwiggins> true
[05:34:58] <blackspotwiggins> huge companies do whatever they want
[05:35:01] <blackspotwiggins> not what is best
[05:35:03] <fr4nk> hi guys!
[05:35:07] <Tobsn> utmx_section is like my myfunc()
[05:35:14] <fr4nk> is there a way to prevent a datepicker to close?
[05:35:42] <seutje> isn't indexOf like not available on oldIE?
[05:35:45] <Tobsn> again, if you guys know any better way... let me know
[05:35:52] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, true
[05:36:44] <seutje> just replace it?
[05:37:12] <seutje> so you can keep an independent mapping of which bit has to be replaced with which random bit
[05:37:30] <seutje> so you can move shit around on your page without having to move the JS along with it
[05:37:44] <blackspotwiggins> Tobsn, http://jsfiddle.net/qkPCJ/9/
[05:37:50] <blackspotwiggins> pretty crude, but still better
[05:38:10] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: it also needs to work if JS is enabled and the external resource fails
[05:38:29] <blackspotwiggins> the random part should be external content?
[05:39:41] <seutje> iono, I guess
[05:39:55] <seutje> tbh, I'd just replace
[05:44:25] <Tobsn> now the question is why didnt google do it that way
[05:44:59] <Tobsn> oh yeah blackspotwiggins
[05:45:10] <Tobsn> if the browser has JS on but JS fails or is empty, your content is gone too
[05:45:47] <Tobsn> http://jsfiddle.net/tobsn/S8EuA/
[05:45:47] <Tobsn> see
[05:45:54] <Tobsn> that cant be
[05:46:20] <seutje> Tobsn: http://jsfiddle.net/qkPCJ/10/
[05:46:21] <blackspotwiggins> better make sure your js works then
[05:46:22] <seutje> too decoupled?
[05:46:35] <seutje> not enough compiled language?
[05:47:09] <Tobsn> yep, that would work
[05:47:45] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/qkPCJ/11/ now even jQuery can fail to load
[05:47:51] <Tobsn> but wouldnt that load first after the page is rendered and you would see flickering?
[05:48:07] <seutje> well this is in a window load, so yeah, I guess
[05:48:31] <seutje> document.write would block the rendering at that position
[05:48:49] <Tobsn> which is "good" i guess... in terms of not showing content you dont want to show
[05:48:50] <blackspotwiggins> not to mention inline scripts
[05:49:33] <Tobsn> with bad styling you could have elements jumping around otherwise
[05:49:58] <Tobsn> maybe it would help if you take something like plain sizzle and deliver it with the JS in the head
[05:50:19] <seutje> I could have written this without using jQuery
[05:50:30] <seutje> it should already bypass sizzle on pretty much all browsers
[05:50:43] <Tobsn> hmm true
[05:51:24] <Tobsn> is data() jq?
[05:51:27] <seutje> it's just that, that other solution, with the noscript, seems extremely annoying to maintain
[05:51:29] <seutje> yeah
[05:51:32] <seutje> ?source data
[05:51:32] <bot-t> Line#1444 - "data: function( elem, name, data, pvt ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#1444
[05:51:42] <Tobsn> is there something already included in js?
[05:51:49] <seutje> getattribute? :P
[05:52:05] <Tobsn> yeah thats what i meant, if there is something included or if you have to do it "by hand" ;)
[05:52:11] <seutje> actually wait
[05:52:17] <seutje> think it's dataset on dom elements
[05:52:25] <seutje> ?g mdn dataset
[05:52:28] <bot-t> seutje, element.dataset - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.dataset
[05:52:30] <Tobsn> hmm still to access the DOM you need to wait until its loaded
[05:52:31] <seutje> :D
[05:52:39] <Tobsn> haha ah yeah there we go
[05:52:52] <Tobsn> IE --- hehe
[05:52:58] <Tobsn> fuck you ie...
[05:53:22] <Tobsn> i think by now MS just wants to fuck with everyone for no reason
[05:53:26] <seutje> seems pretty easy to shim, especially if ur only using strings
[05:53:37] <Tobsn> yeah it would be only plain strings
[05:53:45] <seutje> why does everybody always hate on IE so much :(
[05:53:48] <Tobsn> actually, might be complete html but you can write that in there too
[05:53:56] <Tobsn> cause "---" thats why ;)
[05:53:59] <seutje> fine, they don't have proper support for a couple really useful things
[05:54:03] <Tobsn> hehe
[05:54:05] <jugstah> question: I have a jquery slideshow running and I have a client who wants to have one of the slides have a curtain opening.. how do I fire an event when that slide comes live?
[05:54:14] <seutje> but hey, if it wasn't for IE, there wouldn't have been no AJAX
[05:54:22] <blackspotwiggins> there would also be no ajax bugs
[05:54:25] <Tobsn> which they couldve skipped and used sockets
[05:54:26] <Tobsn> :P
[05:54:32] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: giggedy giggedy
[05:54:36] <blackspotwiggins> giggity goo
[05:54:42] <seutje> also, font-face
[05:54:46] <seutje> contenteditable
[05:54:50] <Tobsn> so DOM load replace or the dirty noscript hack... idk
[05:55:18] <seutje> Tobsn: I still don't get why this needs to be done on the client side though
[05:55:29] <blackspotwiggins> o yea mouseenter/leave
[05:55:33] <Tobsn> you mean in my case or in general?
[05:56:01] <Tobsn> hmm in both cases, convenience
[05:56:12] <Tobsn> i guess
[05:56:21] <Tobsn> + speed
[05:56:31] <blackspotwiggins> speed?
[05:56:48] <Tobsn> parsing dynamic is still slower than just pushing out a gzipped html page and having the client do the work
[05:57:08] <Tobsn> and we're handling a lot impressions here
[05:57:10] <blackspotwiggins> so how exactly is frontend better?
[05:57:13] <Tobsn> also a lot of single pages
[05:57:23] <Tobsn> less load on the server
[05:57:30] <Tobsn> less load on the server, i need less servers to serve more static content
[05:57:38] <blackspotwiggins> lol wat
[05:57:41] <blackspotwiggins> you crazy
[05:57:50] <blackspotwiggins> serving static pages is almost no load
[05:57:50] <Tobsn> me doing this for a very long time ;)
[05:57:57] <Tobsn> yeah thats what im saying
[05:58:00] <Tobsn> its load vs. no load
[05:58:03] <blackspotwiggins> doing noscript fuckery is way slower
[05:58:08] <blackspotwiggins> for the client
[05:58:14] <Tobsn> if i take away dyanmic pages i have more performance for serving even more static pages
[05:58:18] <lalalalala> hi
[05:58:46] <lalalalala> how can put the selected attribute on a specific option from a select element
[05:58:46] <lalalalala> ?
[05:59:13] <seutje> so wait, ur worried about replacing content on dom rdy cause it might cause a delay, but u don't want to do it on the server, because frontend is faster?
[05:59:28] <Tobsn> well sortof
[05:59:43] <blackspotwiggins> in that case serving empty html is the fastest
[05:59:47] <jugstah> is there a way in jQuery to detect when a div becomes visible?
[05:59:50] <blackspotwiggins> generate the whole dom on frontend
[05:59:57] <blackspotwiggins> because NO LOAD ON SERVERS
[05:59:58] <seutje> let's break that down: u don't want X cause Y is too slow, but u don't want Z cause Y is faster?
[06:00:29] <seutje> so somehow Y is both too slow and faster :D
[06:00:35] <Tobsn> so we're at loading dom, then replacing element content vs. writing into the dom while its loading
[06:00:38] <Tobsn> any other ideas?
[06:02:02] <blackspotwiggins> do a/b testing on backend?
[06:03:35] <jugstah> "no load on servers" is a mirage.
[06:14:12] <anli> Will it work cross browsers to read a css value like this? var foo = $("<div class='foo'/>"); alert(foo.height());
[06:14:28] <anli> where .foo { height: 30px; }
[06:14:54] <jugstah_> is it possible to do something like this: $(".curtainwrapper:visible").ready(function () {
[06:29:24] <abletony84> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/cN5RE/11/ has taught me so much thank you
[06:34:01] <seutje> abletony84: uhm, np, I guess
[06:34:17] <abletony84> =)
[06:34:33] <seutje> jugstah_: sure, but that selector will only be evaluated once, so I don't think it'll act like you think it would, why don't you enlighten us with what you're trying to accomplish
[06:34:40] <seutje> what's that factoid again?
[06:34:44] <seutje> ?xy
[06:34:44] <bot-t> You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[06:34:46] <seutje> aha

[06:42:28] <bot-t> JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.

[06:49:21] <wiherek> Hi
[06:49:44] <HyShai4> Has anyone used the plugin for autocomplete that allows for custom HTML?
[06:50:18] <wiherek> I am trying to create an $.each function that will wait for user input before iterating the next element
[06:50:44] <karolyi> HyShai4: http://loopj.com/2009/04/25/jquery-plugin-tokenizing-autocomplete-text-entry/
[06:50:45] <wiherek> is there some way to make it go to the next element on a callback?
[06:54:33] <HyShai4> karolyi: Thanks but that's not what Im looking for
[06:54:46] <HyShai4> karolyi: Sorry I wasn't clear
[06:54:59] <HyShai4> Let me rephrase:
[06:55:37] <HyShai4> My Ajax request returns HTML and I want to use that for my autocomplete results
[06:56:44] <syntax> on which way do you manage your bookmarks?
[06:56:49] <karolyi> HyShai4: idk such a plugin, but you can build yours one
[06:56:56] <HyShai4> scott_gonzalez created a plugin to do it http;//bit.ly/mDvZEG but it doesn't work for me
[06:57:21] <wiherek> how can I control when $.each function iterates to the next element?
[06:57:43] <scott_gonzalez> HyShai4: Do you have an example of it not working?
[06:58:02] <scott_gonzalez> Because I have an example of it working in that repo: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui-extensions/blob/master/autocomplete/html.html
[06:58:39] <HyShai4> scott_gonzalez: It's hard for me to do a jsfiddle cause of the cross domain Ajax request
[06:58:57] <scott_gonzalez> So don't use ajax for the example.
[07:02:24] <HyShai4> scott_gonzalez: Wait a sec, it has to be key, value for the HTML plugin to render as HTML?
[07:02:51] <HyShai4> (I inherited a project that was using the old AC plugin)
[07:05:15] <HyShai4> scott_gonzalez: Wait a sec, it has to be key, value for the HTML plugin to render as HTML?
[07:05:53] <HyShai4> (I inherited a project that was using the old AC plugin)
[07:06:04] <scott_gonzalez> HyShai4: Do you mean label/value?
[07:06:13] <scott_gonzalez> All responses are forced into label/value.
[07:06:16] <HyShai4> Yes sorry
[07:06:35] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.js#L461
[07:10:02] <HyShai4> Ok im trying to do a jsfiddle
[07:10:32] <HyShai4> If it doesn't work - am I allowed to post the URL for my staging site?
[07:11:53] <scott_gonzalez> HyShai4: I won't debug a site.

[07:12:09] <HyShai4> *ok
[07:16:20] <sylock> On one page, I have 2 jquery selectors that catch the same event (the onclick event on a <li>). One if to modify the class of the <li> and change its look when "active"
[07:16:31] <sylock> then other is to trigger an ajax call
[07:16:42] <sylock> it seems that only one of both is executed
[07:17:12] <sylock> is someone have an explanation?
[07:19:31] <Frantz> Can someone help me with a carousel slider issue?
[07:19:45] <Frantz> I think it might be css related, but its positioning gets messed up when the viewport is resized
[07:20:01] <sylock> sorry it works. I made a mistake on my selector type
[07:20:09] <PBDev> QUESTION: I need help with a jquery menu. The jquery menu works fine. I just want it to remain open, if one of the submenu items is clicked.
[07:20:17] <Frantz> http://d.perich.com/ternes/12714/ is the website with the issue
[07:20:21] <PBDev> http://www.londonpumps.co.uk/hvac-clean-water-division/products/aylesbury-valves.html#
[07:20:44] <sylock> But I have this warning on firebug : $(event).preventDefault is not a function
[07:20:55] <sylock> is someone have an idea?
[07:22:18] <sylock> hum, it seems that event.preventDefault() is working  but not $(event).preventDefault()
[07:22:37] <seutje> there is no $.fn.preventDefault
[07:22:55] <sylock> seutje: ?
[07:22:57] <seutje> what made you try $(event).preventDefault()?
[07:23:00] <agunia> hey BillCriswell
[07:23:10] <BillCriswell> agunia: Howdy.
[07:23:13] <seutje> PBDev: you mean across the pageload?
[07:23:30] <sylock> sorry but I don't know well javascript and so jquery
[07:23:33] <agunia> ah just run into some problems because of the forever scroll
[07:23:52] <seutje> sylock: that's not rly an answer, is it?
[07:23:54] <agunia> is there any way i could use some extra span instead of useing data-max?
[07:24:23] <PBDev> yeah
[07:24:38] <Frantz> Wondering if anyone can help me with something, I think it will be fairly quick?
[07:24:43] <agunia> because when i use data-max the counter is being displayed twice on the forever scroll
[07:24:48] <Mariaa> hi i am trying to mainpulate response of ajax call in done callback http://pastie.org/5103746 but cannot
[07:24:51] <Mariaa> any ideas?
[07:25:02] <sylock> seutje: maybe not but I don't see what else I could answer. I thought $(selector).function was the way to do
[07:25:14] <Frantz> http://d.perich.com/ternes/12714/ - - if you resize your viewport window the div with the content doesn't stay in the same spot
[07:25:26] <seutje> sylock: that's for doing jQuery stuff on DOM elements
[07:25:58] <seutje> sylock: event is an eventObject (not a DOM element object) passed to the event handler, it has its own set of methods and stuff
[07:26:15] <seutje> sylock: it is in no way related to jQuery, so wrapping it in jQuery won't do much good afaict
[07:26:24] <sylock> seutje: ok! thanks for your explanations
[07:26:30] <seutje> ?g mdn event preventdefault & sylock
[07:26:31] <bot-t> seutje, No results found for 'mdn event preventdefault & sylock'.
[07:26:36] <seutje> WATTTT?
[07:26:42] <seutje> oh
[07:26:46] <seutje> ?g mdn event preventdefault @ sylock
[07:26:47] <bot-t> sylock, event.preventDefault - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/event.preventDefault
[07:26:48] <seutje> :D
[07:27:10] <sylock> thanks a lot ;)
[07:27:27] <seutje> sylock: MDN is a nice resource of regular old JS stuffs
[07:29:11] <HyShai4> scott_gonzalez: Ok thanks I got it working on jslint
[07:29:13] <ShawnRisk> How do I make the toplink highlighted and the sublinks stay open when I click items from each section.  If I click info or sublinks should be highlighted and the sublinks stay open.  How to fix this: http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/x3FHa/4/
[07:29:40] <HyShai4> scott_gonzalez: thanks for you rhelp
[07:29:50] <scott_gonzalez> HyShai4: no problem, glad you got it working.
[07:33:30] <ShawnRisk> I started with this: http://jsfiddle.net/nBtz6/5/ before going to this: http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/x3FHa/4/
[07:34:25] <PBDev> okay I figured it out. I just need to make the style display block
[07:34:45] <PBDev> how can I use jquery dom to change style to display:block ? anyone
[07:36:45] <agunia> How could i fix this http://jsfiddle.net/L6TJF/5/ so it does not use data-max ?
[07:37:46] <WebDragon> ShawnRisk: actually... I figured it out, I think: http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/x3FHa/5/  if anyone has any critique of my solution, please step in, I could use any tips WRT this trick
[07:38:06] <WebDragon> not sure I've done it the Best Way™
[07:38:09] <BillCriswell> agunia: Just assign a number to max instead of reading from the attribute.
[07:38:40] <WebDragon> ShawnRisk: I was gonna leave to get the cigs but it nagged at me and then I saw it
[07:39:00] <ShawnRisk> WebDragon: you know the top class is a link too?
[07:39:16] <frantz> Is there a way to execute a script after a user has adjusted their viewport window?
[07:39:49] <WebDragon> ShawnRisk: I moved it to the submenu in the example if you really needed it to be a link
[07:40:32] <agunia> BillCriswell http://jsfiddle.net/L6TJF/6/ it says NaN can you check if i did it right please?
[07:40:40] <WebDragon> ShawnRisk: you'll have to definitely ask these guys how to do it differently if you want the actual top menu to behave AS A LINK as well AS A TOGGLE *(those things conflict events wise)*
[07:40:56] <PBDev> something like this?: http://pastebin.com/qvp7un0x
[07:41:06] <WebDragon> so I stuck it in the submenu if you actually need to be able to go there
[07:41:08] <BillCriswell> agunia: Are you looking anything up
[07:41:17] <ShawnRisk> WebDragon: okay thanks
[07:41:28] <frantz> can you use $(window).resize(function) AND on page load at the same time?
[07:41:39] <frantz> like load something on document ready and then load again on window resize?
[07:43:14] <BillCriswell> agunia: http://jsfiddle.net/L6TJF/7/
[07:44:42] <BillCriswell> agunia: You really should be looking up these functions.
[07:44:44] <agunia> BillCriswell thanks again so much sorry im not good in jquery but i will learn
[07:45:06] <agunia> BillCriswell can you reccomend a good jquery js tutorial for me ?
[07:47:36] <ShawnRisk> How do I make the toplink highlighted and the sublinks stay open when I click items from each section.  If I click info or sublinks should be highlighted and the sublinks stay open.  I started with this: http://jsfiddle.net/nBtz6/5/ before going to this: http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/x3FHa/5/
[07:47:48] <dotDeeka> agunia: http://jqfundamentals.com/ is a good beginner site by some great js developers up in Boston
[07:49:08] <agunia> dotDeeka thanks i will go over it
[07:49:22] <jomofcw> What's better to use : $element[0] or $element.get(0) ?
[07:51:08] <frantz> Can someone help me out with a jquery carousel?
[07:51:13] <ShawnRisk> To update my question, the top links: Info and Pets are suppose to be links as well.
[07:52:17] <frantz> Is there a way to reset a jquery function on page resize in addition to executing the script on page load?
[07:52:23] <BillCriswell> agunia: That's the one I'd use. Also, I don't get to write much jQuery so I built a quick plugin for what you're trying to accomplish. The code here should help: http://staging.intuitsolutions.net/TextLimit/
[07:56:13] <frantz> How can I make all of this execute on window resize in addition to when the page first loads http://pastie.org/5103885
[07:56:32] <agunia> BilCriswell thanks let me look it up, this is counter thing is more complicated than i thought even after removing the max-data it still will mulitply plies itslef , basically i have the page set up to load 5 more comments then after each 5 comments where i scroll down a new counter appears
[07:57:55] <agunia> BillCriswell i will try the plugin see hw it works
[07:58:17] <agunia> basically if i dint use forever scroll it would work perfectly fine
[07:58:24] <devone> Hi is it ok to ask jquery style cascading question in here?
[07:59:10] <anli> Does css3 specify a way of creating a border that is within the dimensions of the element?
[07:59:19] <anli> Like outline
[07:59:20] <devone> inset?
[07:59:29] <anli> inset seems to create a 3d border
[08:02:21] <Gho5t> if I have a list of anchors how can I find the index of the one with a class of "hover" ?
[08:02:38] <Gho5t> $anchors.index('.hover') doesn't seem to work
[08:02:49] <BillCriswell> agunia: If forever scroll has some kind of callback after it loads more items just run the plugin code again.
[08:05:04] <devone> I am trying to emulate a mini cascading framework similar to jquery. Can anyone advise on something I am stuck on? test('#selector').my_func(function() { test('#selector').changeColor('red'); });       as you can see I am calling the test('#selector') object 2x since this will refer to window. is there a better way to do this, within the chain/cascade itself? Should I set a hard copy of the
[08:05:04] <devone> object to the window object each initialisation?
[08:05:09] <agunia> ok let me try what i can do
[08:05:18] <zfly9> can anyone tell me why this image randomizer is working in http://jsfiddle.net/SXtAg/3/ but not  http://tolaw.highrankdev.com/about/
[08:06:33] <Tobsn> zfly9, + 1
[08:07:15] <zfly9> ?
[08:07:31] <Tobsn> http://jsfiddle.net/tobsn/qkPCJ/
[08:07:34] <Tobsn> compare the random
[08:07:48] <Tobsn> ah nevermind
[08:07:50] <Tobsn> lol.
[08:07:59] <Tobsn> youre starting with 0 i should remove it on my side hehe
[08:08:05] <jugstah_> is it possible to check the display attribute of a div?
[08:08:15] <jugstah_> to see if its display: block instead of display: none?
[08:08:20] <BillCriswell> jugstah_: $el.css('display')
[08:08:33] <zfly9> Tobsn, are you helping me or saying you have the same issue?
[08:08:37] <BillCriswell> jugstah_: There's also $el.is(':visible')
[08:09:02] <Tobsn> zfly9, http://jsfiddle.net/tobsn/SXtAg/4/ works
[08:09:06] <BillCriswell> zfly9: Check your console. There's lots of errors there.
[08:09:25] <jugstah_> hmm ok thats what i thought
[08:09:31] <jugstah_> if ($(".curtainwrapper").is(':visible')) is what i had
[08:10:21] <danmichel> could anyone tell me why I'm getting ' $container.imagesLoaded is not a function'  http://pastie.org/5101796 on my home server http://theplural.com when I'm not getting it on my  live site http://varmag.com/ ? Only difference is that the JS is combined on the live site
[08:10:23] <BillCriswell> jugstah_: That should work just fine.
[08:10:43] <computer2000> i have a multidimensional js object and want to select a child of a child, but myObj.child.child doesnt work, neither does myObj['child']['child'] ... any help pls?
[08:10:45] <computer2000> obj looks like this: http://pastebin.com/wrHvfqQm
[08:10:47] <computer2000> i hope that js object is well formed?
[08:10:51] <jugstah_> it doesnt seem to fire when the div comes visible
[08:11:04] <jugstah_> is it possible to look for a specific div with nth-child?
[08:11:32] <BillCriswell> jugstah_: Not sure why it wouldn't.
[08:11:47] <zfly9> Tobsn, it's still saying uncaught error, unexpected token illegal
[08:11:48] <BillCriswell> jugstah_: Yeah, $('div').eq( 2 )
[08:12:05] <Tobsn> yeah you need to fix the stuff on your page
[08:12:12] <Tobsn> i assume you have an error somewhere
[08:12:16] <Tobsn> tag too much or something
[08:12:23] <BillCriswell> jugstah_: If you want to get crazy you can do $('div:nth-child(2n + 3)') as well.
[08:12:41] <rzec> is there an event that is triggered when someone clicks on an option in the browser's default implementation of autocomplete for an input element (I have tried mouseup and focus)?
[08:12:53] <Ansikt> So, I'm trying to give every four divs an equal height.  But I'm still learning at JavaScript/JQuery.  Could someone give me a few pointers as to what's wrong with my code here? http://jsfiddle.net/yWBew/12/
[08:12:59] <jugstah_> ok cool, i suspect my :visible is incorrect as it was looking at a child of the div that's changing displays
[08:13:10] <jugstah_> brb
[08:13:13] <BillCriswell> jugstah_: Got it.
[08:13:25] <vedic> Hi, I am strugglling to find the issue with my slideToggle on Safari. It works great in FF, IE, Chrome but doesn't work in Safari. In Safari is the window slides down and then slides up again quickly. Here I have tried creating jsfiddle (it doesn't work properly as the actual code base is very lengthy around 750 lines with multiple ajax but it does have the function where I am doing this SlideToggle.)  http://jsfiddle.net/qkYL2/1/
[08:13:56] <zfly9> nvm guys got it, thanks bentonam
[08:14:06] <vedic> I am using jquery 1.8.2
[08:14:08] <zfly9> wordpress was putting a hidden ? in it
[08:14:13] <bentonam> np
[08:14:36] <fRAiLtY-> I've set $$ to noConflict (i think) yet I get an odd stack error here: http://www.printpanoramics.co.uk/ on the slider
[08:14:39] <fRAiLtY-> Why?
[08:15:30] <jugstah_> Bill - this looks correct, right? if ($(".Slides:nth-child(2)").is(':visible'))
[08:16:24] <Ansikt> Was forgetting to push to my array.  Check here for updated code: http://jsfiddle.net/yWBew/13/
[08:16:26] <vedic> Has anybody found the issue with slideToggle on Safari? or SlideDown & SlideUp ? In my case, the div slides down and the quickly slides up again where as slide up should not happen without I click
[08:16:39] <Ansikt> Not to imply that it works or anything.
[08:19:53] <earthquake> Ansikt: every 4th div to be an equal height right? http://jsfiddle.net/yWBew/15/
[08:20:24] <earthquake> or did i misunderstand
[08:20:35] <Ansikt> each group of four divs should be the same height.  So, equal height rows
[08:21:13] <earthquake> ah ok
[08:21:13] <Ansikt> Every row should be the height of the largest element.
[08:21:32] <Ansikt> Sorry that my code isn't readable enough to make this appearant :(
[08:23:03] <jugstah_> nth-childs don't work on hidden divs right?
[08:23:29] <Lucky--> should work as long as its not display:none
[08:23:35] <Lucky--> display:none doesnt render it on the dom
[08:23:40] <Lucky--> visibility: hidden does
[08:23:43] <Morkel> i made a table row clickable with jquery. This works fine when i click normal on the row. But when i click with command + click for a new tab than the link open in the current tab
[08:23:53] <jugstah_> hmmm ok..
[08:23:55] <jugstah_> thx
[08:24:45] <jugstah_> need to be able to detect the 2nd div of a slideshow which is using display: none or display: block
[08:24:46] <jugstah_> gay
[08:24:48] <jugstah_> mm
[08:27:56] <scar> why will this work in chrome but not IE or FF? it appears as if my Variable ULGSettings.ajaxurl isnt being passed, but it is in chrome? http://ulg.alomedia.net/product/flatware-bridal-brunch/
[08:27:58] <scar> try to hit Add to cart
[08:28:16] <xec_> Ansikt: http://jsfiddle.net/yWBew/13/
[08:28:44] <xec_> Ansikt: because curBoxes is a native js array (not a jquery collection) you can't do .each() on it
[08:30:38] <Ansikt> xec_:  Well, that explains things a bit.  But isn't your fiddle still a native JS array as well?
[08:31:26] <xec_> Ansikt: yes. i'm using native js Array.forEach() https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
[08:32:18] <xec_> Ansikt: which won't work in IE8 or older. if you care about that, check out the polyfill on that page
[08:32:47] <xec_> Ansikt: or use jquery's $.each(array, func)
[08:34:29] <Ansikt> xec_, I don't think you are.  Maybe it didn't save before you sent me the link?  I found a solution using a different method, but I'm curious how you suggested I did it.
[08:35:08] <Ansikt> *do
[08:35:09] <xec_> Ansikt: ah! sorry http://jsfiddle.net/yWBew/17/
[08:36:21] <jugstah_> I have it set up so that it detects when a div has changed. how do i detect a specific div within that div?
[08:36:42] <jugstah_> if ($(".curtainwrapper")) { sound right?
[08:36:48] <Ansikt> That works!  And most of my code is still intact.  Awesome.  Are there any optimation or best practice suggestions to be made about my code?
[08:36:57] <Ansikt> xec_ ^^
[08:39:00] <xec_> Ansikt: i'm not sure - it's probably fine. the trailing .forEach() i just slapped after the loop could be fixed though, it's not very dry ;)
[08:43:38] <fRAiLtY-> I've set $$ to noConflict (i think) yet I get an odd stack error here: http://www.printpanoramics.co.uk/ on the slider
[08:44:20] <xec_> jugstah_: no that doesnt look right
[08:45:14] <scar> how can i create an "array" of "triggers", and then loop through each? i'
[08:45:15] <jugstah_> nope it doesnt... it doesnt get fired at all
[08:45:34] <scar> i'll be using this for form validation-- grabbing a specified list of targets-- then looping through
[08:45:42] <xec_> jugstah_: if you already have the parent div in a var and want to check if it contains another, you could do if (myDivVar.find(".myClass").length) {...}
[08:46:06] <xec_> scar: what is a "trigger"?
[08:47:25] <scar> xec_: i mean a target... basically i have $('#ulg_shipping_email') -- but i also have address1, address2, city, state, zip, etc but i want to loop through the targets and grab their values to see if they are empty, rather than doing var ulg_shipping_email = $('#ulg_shipping_email'); then if (ulg_shipping_email == '') --- i could just maybe use .each on the array
[08:47:47] <scar> xec_: i dont necessarily want to grab ALL form items to make sure they are selected-- just the array i create
[08:48:12] <scar> maybe im thinking too PHP
[08:48:46] <xec_> scar: so what does your array contain?
[08:48:58] <xec_> a list of selector strings?
[08:49:32] <scar> xec_: if $('#ulg_shipping_email') is a 'selector string', then yes. im unfamiliar with the basic terminology, but have been diving head first into jquery haha
[08:50:04] <xec_> no, that's a jquery collection containing the element with that id
[08:50:07] <scar> xec_: i suppose my question now is assuming above is an example of a selector string, how do i create this array of selector strings?
[08:50:14] <xec_> do you have a common class on all the inputs you want?
[08:50:43] <scar> xec_: i could, but im going to want to flag each one thats empty, not the whole class
[08:51:39] <xec_> scar: so what you want is a collection containing all the empty inputs?
[08:52:07] <xec_> scar: maybe it's easier to understand what you're trying to do if you have a pastebin of your form html
[08:52:11] <scar> xec_: yes. i want an array of selector strings so i can loop through them, check the value, and if the value is empty, then somehow do $(this).myMethod()
[08:52:49] <scar> rather than doing var ulg_shipping_email = $('#ulg_shipping_email'); if(ulg_shipping_email == '') { $(.myForm).preventDefault(); etc etc
[08:52:59] <scar> i dont want to have to do that for EACH one, id like to somehow collect an array of those selectors :)
[08:53:28] <xec_> scar: i think i know what you're getting at. maybe see ?add
[08:53:29] <bot-t> scar, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[08:53:54] <xec_> scar: you can start with selecting the first input, and use .add() to push to the collection
[08:54:10] <scar> hmm
[08:54:41] <xec_> - or - you can use a comma separated selector, like $(".myFirstInput, .mySecondInput")
[08:54:55] <scar> sounds like more than i would need. what is the equivalent of $var = array('me', 'you'); in jquery? so maybe do something like $var = array( $('#foo'), $('#bar') ); but in jquery
[08:55:36] <scar> or is .add() the equivalent of $var[] = $(#foo); in php? so as .add is adding an elemnt to an array?
[08:56:24] <xec_> scar: no, .add() is the equivalent of array_push()
[08:56:27] <xec_> http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-push.php
[08:57:47] <xec_> scar: it is often beneficial to think in terms of css selectors. if you can make a css selector to style the inputs you're interested in half the work is done, you can just give that selector to jquery
[08:58:15] <scar> xec_
[08:58:26] <scar> xec: http://pastebin.com/E26znHUx
[08:58:36] <scar> thats what im WANTING to do, so to speak--- but i cant create an array of objects
[08:58:53] <scar> xec_ and i would be using a class to set the field red, etc to notify hte user, yes.
[08:58:55] <scar> the(
[08:58:58] <scar> the** oops
[08:59:27] <scar> within .each() would be my code, obviously
[08:59:52] <xec_> right. then do the comma separated selector, for instance
[09:00:42] <scar> var ulg_fields = $('#ulg_shipping_city', '#ulg_shipping_state'); ?
[09:00:51] <xec_> almost
[09:01:00] <xec_> $('#ulg_shipping_city, #ulg_shipping_state')
[09:01:27] <xec_> http://pastebin.com/WXdrP6UP
[09:01:30] <scar> ahh that would make sense. i think i get it now that i realize they are called 'selector strings'-- jquery just parses that string with some sort of DOM regex maybe
[09:02:37] <scar> so what im doing is asking the wrong question, because you _dont_ create an array of selector strings, you use the selector string commas to separate lol.
[09:02:40] <xec_> scar: depending on your browser, it will internally either do querySelectorAll() https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Document.querySelectorAll or use sizzle http://sizzlejs.com/
[09:03:01] <scar> and i can use $(this) within .each ?
[09:03:06] <xec_> scar: correct
[09:03:27] <scar> intersting. well thank you for the guidance. helped me out with the logistics, not just the unique problem which is good bc i need it haha.
[09:04:09] <xec_> anytime, always happy to help someone who is eager to learn ;)
[09:04:26] <nratter> i'm trying to get dynamic fields to work using mootools. I can clone the div containing the input field(s), but am having trouble getting it to change the attributes (name/ids) of the input fields inside the cloned div. Can anyone please help? http://jsfiddle.net/6Xg4S/29/
[09:05:05] <xec_> doesn't mootools have its own channel?
[09:05:23] <nratter> yes but no one answers :)
[09:06:44] <scar> xec_: it seems the select isnt being grabbed. http://ulg.alomedia.net/bag/grab/
[09:07:06] <scar> xec_ oh wait you have to have an item in your cart crap. well all my input boxes are changing border colors but not the select
[09:07:59] <scar> xec_ nevermind. i found the problem. has nothing to do with this method :) nvm
[09:08:32] <xec_> scar: just noticed there's a typo in my pastebin btw, so dont copypaste it
[09:10:18] <adavia> is there a way to set up the jquery autocomplete to send some specific value to the server once an item is selected?
[09:13:32] <xckpd7> question: I need to execute an action when 2 uncoupled things are loaded... can I do this with pubsub?
[09:15:07] <xckpd7> Think of this: I have a dropdown that when triggered, refreshes itself and a widget... I need to disable the dropdown until both the widget is loaded, and when the dropdowns are finally refreshed....
[09:17:28] <scar> how do i undo preventDefault ?
[09:17:45] <xec_> ctrl+z
[09:17:56] <xec_> right after you typed it in
[09:18:14] <scar> xec_: no lol. how do i allowDefault() ?
[09:18:14] <scar> lol
[09:18:28] <Somatt_wrk> can you get rid of $(document).ready(function() {...}); if your script is placed at the bottom of your document ?
[09:18:32] <xec_> i don't think you can
[09:18:44] <xec_> Somatt_wrk: yep
[09:18:59] <Somatt_wrk> xec_: thanks for confirming
[09:19:42] <BillCriswell> scar: If you need to do that it seems like you might be doing soemthing a little funny.
[09:19:42] <BillCriswell> .
[09:20:12] <xec_> xckpd7: have you looked at http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/ ?
[09:20:29] <scar> xec_ is there a way to do the same as prevent default but not use prevent default?
[09:20:42] <xec_> scar: that makes 0 sense
[09:20:55] <xec_> you want to do A but not A
[09:21:19] <BillCriswell> scar: What are you trying to accomplish?
[09:21:21] <scar> xec_: well, i have this form. and if a required field is not entered, i want it to not submit the form but shwo which fields are empty-- then when user corrects, i want the form to work again.
[09:21:27] <scar> BillCriswell: ^^
[09:21:32] <xckpd7> xec_: no I haven't... I'll have to do some research.. thanks!
[09:22:10] <BillCriswell> scar: When you preventDefault() on a submit action it only works for that submit.
[09:22:15] <scar> maybe i can have my button be a normal button, and if the required check passes then i can use trigger to trigger a hidden button?
[09:22:38] <xec_> scar: then put the preventDefault inside a conditional (for when the posting is not valid)
[09:22:54] <scar> BillCriswell, xec_: http://pastebin.com/g5HLYs4n
[09:22:58] <BillCriswell> if( errors.length ) { showErrors(); event.preventDefault(); }
[09:23:11] <scar> i did, but then when the button is selected again and everything is valid, the form wont submit
[09:23:41] <xec_> scar: also, you call .preventDefault() on the event object, it's not a property you set on an element
[09:24:29] <xec_> scar: something like $("form").submit(function(event){ if(formIsNotValid){event.preventDefault()}})
[09:24:35] <BillCriswell> scar: You're approaching this whole thing in a strange way.
[09:24:45] <scar> ahh that might be it
[09:24:57] <scar> BillCriswell: well im new to jquery and just diving in head first getting it to do what i want
[09:25:01] <scar> BillCriswell: i changed to event not the form.
[09:26:01] <scar> BillCriswell: however okay. here is my code, and the form still submits even though i call preventDefault: http://pastebin.com/3Dphi7LG
[09:26:05] <jugstah_> if I have a <div style="display: block">, does if($('#SpotlightSlides.Slides:nth-child(2)').css('display') == 'block') look correct?
[09:26:24] <jugstah_> or do i need to use the .attr selector?
[09:26:52] <xec_> ?submit @ scar
[09:26:53] <bot-t> scar, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[09:27:54] <xec_> jugstah_: if the div has that id and class, then sure
[09:29:01] <jugstah_> hmm, the child div in#SpotlightSlides.Slides
[09:29:09] <jugstah_> so maybe I needed to add a .div
[09:29:34] <xec_> jugstah_: if its a descendant, add a space. if its a child, use ">"
[09:30:02] <mib_mib> Hi guys, i load a javascript on a 3rd party page, but I need to load my version of jquery on their site - but I don't want it to conflict with their version. How can I remap jQuery to a different variable, so their version and my version work together without intersecting?
[09:30:21] <mib_mib> i.e. i would like to refer to my jquery differently, using like jq$ instead of just $ or what not
[09:30:35] <xec_> jugstah_: if you want the second child of #parent, "#parent > :nth-child(2)"
[09:32:21] <TrentonDAdams> hey guys.  I have a strange problem.  I use serialize() in one piece of code, and it works, but when I use it in another piece of code, it returns a blank string, and I can't figure out why.
[09:32:23] <jugstah_> ok sec
[09:32:30] <xec_> it
[09:32:42] <xec_> it's "xec", not "sec" ;)
[09:32:44] <xec_> j/k
[09:34:13] <eip56> Whats the best way to get the child of a node. IE an IMG nested in an A tag. There is only one IMG in each A so I feel like .children() is a waste? better way to get it?
[09:35:27] <TrentonDAdams> never mind, I was using the wrong id, lol.
[09:35:55] <xec_> eip56: performance-wise .children() is pretty good, i'd go for that. if you go vanilla there is .firstChild
[09:37:14] <eip56> Thanks xec_ I will probably just stick with it. Is .firstChild still supported? and I think im just getting caught up on it because it implies plural... obviously works for single. I dont think .find() would be better as it goes multiple levels when I only need one.
[09:39:06] <xec_> eip56: by "vanilla" i mean plain old DOM, instead of jquery https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Node.firstChild
[09:39:14] <TrentonDAdams> I'm trying to filter down my results to exclude certain form elements from my 'serialize'.  I want to exclude a single hidden input, so I can change it.  I was attempting the following, but it doesn't appear to work.
[09:39:26] <TrentonDAdams> jQuery('#form-exam-course').filter(':not(*[name="subAction"])')
[09:39:33] <xec_> heh, i love the note on that page, that just says "Note: "
[09:44:14] <TrentonDAdams> never mind, I have to add the ':input' to the form selector, otherwise it only returns the form element! :D
[09:46:26] <sunbeam> Whats the best for mobile smartphones?
[09:46:27] <sunbeam> media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
[09:46:28] <sunbeam> ?
[09:48:04] <Zzaichik> smart phones are all over the place.
[09:48:19] <Zzaichik> it's more about ppi than pixels
[09:48:29] <chasepeeler_work> Trying to find support for the new Menu widget, where the top level items are laid out horizontally, the 2nd level show up below the top level, and all 2nd level and below items are listed vertically, and flow horizontally
[09:49:43] <sunbeam> Zzaichik: how do you mean?
[09:50:19] <chasepeeler_work> here is an example of the layout/flow I want to achieve (don't care about the other visual aspects) http://djdesignfuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/september/jquery_menu/jquery_menu_12.jpg
[09:52:42] <scar> how can i use .replace() to return the same string with the replacements?
[09:53:38] <Zzaichik> sunbeam: ppi = pixels per inch, retina display has 300 more ppi than iPhone 4s, So 480px might look good on the 4S but it will look way small and weird on the iPhone 5.
[09:53:54] <fALSO> retina display
[09:54:10] <Zzaichik> Same goes for other phones, they all have different screen sizes and different resolutions.
[09:54:19] <Zzaichik> well, not all - but there is quite a variety.
[09:57:46] <eip56> So this is more of a code structure question. I have started writing my objects before the doc.ready() is this the best way of doing it or should I write it on another file ? or inside the doc.ready()? heres a link to some basic code. http://hastebin.com/hofasaxade.coffee  more just about the structure ... no critiques on code ;-p!
[09:58:04] <Zzaichik> err I said 4s vs 5, I meant 4 vs 4s and 5
[10:00:25] <danmichel> could anyone tell me why I'm getting ' $container.imagesLoaded is not a function'  http://pastie.org/5101796 on my home server http://theplural.com when I'm not getting it on my  live site http://varmag.com/ ? Only difference is that the JS is combined on the live site
[10:00:49] <Gho5t> has one experienced an issue in Firefox when using .load to load an image's content? It seems that the callback is firing for me instantly and not waiting until the image is loaded
[10:02:25] <robgleeson> anyone see this before: Uncaught TypeError: Property 'source' of object #<Object> is not a function
[10:02:51] <robgleeson> it happens when I enter text into an input field that has .autocomplete() called on it.
[10:02:55] <robgleeson> appreciate any ideas...
[10:05:16] <lambacck> I'm trying to upgrade from jQuery-UI 1.8.23 to 1.9 and running into this bug: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8713
[10:06:23] <lambacck> How soon are we likely to get a 1.9.1 release? Also, anyone know of a workaround? I tried setting the handles option after creation, but it doesn't seem to take.
[10:10:07] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/evpS9/45/ anyoe have any idea what's wrong with this fiddle? pretty simple jq validation
[10:15:22] <anew> anyone???
[10:15:40] <lambacck> I monkey patched the jQuery.widget.extend and that fixed my problem.
[10:42:23] <sunbeam> in a html responsive site i try to create i want the header to display/fill the full width/height of the browser screen
[10:42:28] <sunbeam> when any of the header nav links are clicked the site should reveal the rest of the content
[10:42:32] <sunbeam> and those header nav links should always be at the bottom of the screen
[10:57:58] <eip56> I have an object. inside the object there are 3 functions. The first calls the second the second calls the third. SHouldn't I be able to call the third from the second by this.functionName; no ()
[11:02:07] <NoiseEee> eip56: no; () executes it.
[11:02:23] <NoiseEee> you can surely refer to the function without them, but you can't execute it
[11:04:10] <iaj> Hey there.. I got a div.foo that I initially have set up as display: none;    now I want to have a fadeIn() animation after the page has been loadd for like 5 sec - where an I look into for further information?
[11:05:38] <phxheat> hi, i have a video (html5 <video> tag) that i want to make disappear upon fully playing. what function/approach would i go about that with jquery (to detect when the video is done playing)?
[11:07:39] <phxheat> nevermind, found the solution
[11:26:14] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/evpS9/71/ anyone have any idea why this works on fiddle but not live
[11:27:10] <FrozenFire> Is there a jQuery.support flag to determine the availability of :checked? If not, is there a simple means to detect the availability of that feature?
[11:27:22] <NoiseEee> anew: find the difference between the 'fiddle' and your 'live'
[11:27:58] <anew> no difference, it's copy pasted :S
[11:30:37] <chasepeeler_work> anew: are both running in IE? is one internally hosted? If so, it could be loading with different compatibility settings
[11:31:09] <anew> jQuery("#form1").validate({ seems it never goes thru this line live
[11:31:45] <anew> could it be conflicting with other jq on the page
[11:31:49] <anew> ?
[11:32:13] <saganbyte> FrozenFire, why not just use the DOM checked property?
[11:33:01] <FrozenFire> saganbyte, I'm trying to determine the availability of that feature and apply a fallback if it's not available.
[11:33:30] <saganbyte> FrozenFire, understood
[11:36:12] <anew> chasepeeler_work both are in chrome
[11:37:02] <saganbyte> FrozenFire, the documentation suggests using checkClone
[11:37:19] <chasepeeler_work> I'd look at other things that aren't the same: how are you loading jquery? how are you loading the plugin? same order? same versions? etc
[11:37:38] <chasepeeler_work> code might be the same, but there are differences between your environment and the fiddle
[11:38:24] <anew> could it be conflicting with other jq on the page or is it a loadig problem ?
[11:39:06] <FrozenFire> saganbyte, Hrmm. I'm not sure that that would necessarily provide this detection. I think I'll just set the fallback to always-on. It works in either case. I just didn't want to unnecessarily clutter the DOM if it was available.
[11:50:01] <sunbeam> hello, in a html responsive site i try to create i want the header to display/fill the full width/height of the browser screen
[11:50:04] <sunbeam> when any of the header nav links are clicked the site should reveal the rest of the content
[11:50:10] <sunbeam> and those header nav links should always be at the bottom of the screen
[11:50:14] <sunbeam> how can i best do this?
[11:53:16] <freeone3000> sunbeam: Fixed positioning to keep it at the bottom, resize with an animation to cause it to go from full-height to min-height.
[11:55:18] <trumpetmic> Good afternoon!  How would you go about doing this in jQuery:   Have a <select> that is displaced by an <input> after an <option> is chosen.
[11:56:05] <NoiseEee> personally i'd hide the <select> and then either unhide/create the <input> ?
[11:56:48] <fruitwerks> anyone know why with jsonp I can only add one ?param=foo to a google feeds query, anything extra and it fails, but it works on playground
[12:03:07] <sunbeam> freeone3000: i don't get what you mean,
[12:03:19] <sunbeam> freeone3000: i want below height: 100% of the html (which has a background cover)
[12:03:31] <sunbeam> the content to be
[12:08:58] <fruitwerks> ok let me ask this, is it possible to modify headers for a jsonp request?
[12:12:53] <jax> hello, i'm a checkbox inside a <tr> and furher down, there is another <tr> containing a table somewhere (dont ask…).. how can i find this table? $(this).lookingForNextTable to occur
[12:13:28] <NoiseEee> jax: surely you mean <td>
[12:14:02] <jax> uh, yes. sorry
[12:14:03] <TrentonDAdams> fruitwerks: I think you can use beforeSend, and jqXHR object to change request information.
[12:14:25] <jax> <tr><td>checkbox</td>..</tr><tr><td><table data-rel='imlookingforyou'...
[12:14:54] <TrentonDAdams> fruitwerks: Yeah, something like this                 jqXHR.setRequestHeader(name, value);
[12:16:25] <fruitwerks> xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); - is that right?
[12:16:57] <fruitwerks> then I do http://screencast.com/t/HTtdOqcbeX5b
[12:17:28] <NoiseEee> jax: at that point its just easier to grab the parent table and search for $('table[data-rel="imlookingforyou"]')
[12:17:37] <NoiseEee> off the top of my head
[12:18:18] <jax> hm.. but that will give me multiple tables
[12:18:24] <jax> there is more than one
[12:18:56] <jax> oh wait, i think i got it
[12:19:22] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: u here?
[12:19:38] <NoiseEee> jax: more than one with the same data-rel?
[12:19:49] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: css not really my bag
[12:20:14] <jax> NoiseEee: yes. is that not good?
[12:20:23] <jax> also, how can i select the next parent up 'table'
[12:20:26] <jax> and not all the parents
[12:20:36] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: ok sorry
[12:20:44] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: my idea is more to do this with jquery
[12:20:50] <NoiseEee> jax: closes()
[12:20:53] <NoiseEee> closest()
[12:20:54] <sunbeam> as I think it's not possible to do this CSS only
[12:26:15] <jax> if i'm inside a <td> and need to get the next <tr> how do i do that?
[12:26:32] <jax> if $this is an element inside that <td>
[12:28:22] <NoiseEee> closest('tr').next('tr') iirc
[12:28:28] <fruitwerks> ok I think this url is working properly url: 'https://www.google.com/m8/feeds/contacts/default/full?alt=json' does anyone know the proper URI for a specific group?
[12:29:01] <freeed> ugh.. banging my head. Does anyone see why the <div> would not be appended? "foo" and "BLAH!" both append but the div is no where to be found. http://d.pr/n/WfdT
[12:30:08] <jax> perfect, thx NoiseEee
[12:30:25] <freeed> ..works without the class="" part :\ odd
[12:31:28] <NoiseEee> freeed: are you triply sure that the classes themselves aren't defined to not display?
[12:31:35] <NoiseEee> quadruply sure?
[12:32:20] <freeed> NoiseEee, nah I mean the <div> isn't even inserted into the dom with <div class="foo"> but .append('<div></div>') works fine
[12:32:57] <Symbi0nt|GER> Is there a small plugin available which syncs a textfield with a selector?
[12:35:28] <twittard> Are there any plugins for validating / normalizing Time input?  I don't care about Dates.  Just "1p" / "1:00pm" / "1300" / etc.  Or a good UI plugin that makes choosing a consistent time easy?
[12:38:20] <jamey-uk> Can someone tell me why $(target_name).find('input, textarea').focus(); would be causing a recursive stack overflow whereas setTimeout("$(target_name).find('input, textarea').focus();", 1); doesn't?
[12:39:22] <jax> say i have a table with tr's.. is there a way to check if all tr's have a certain property?
[12:40:14] <anew> ok jq gurus, how the heck does this not work http://jsfiddle.net/Va57j/3/
[12:40:34] <jamey-uk> jax: what sort of property?
[12:40:56] <green-_> anything come to mind that would cause fadeOut() to, instead of fading out an element, just do nothing to it for a few seconds and then it just disappears?
[12:41:00] <jax> well, i got tr's containing td's and they contain checkboxes. i would like to check if all checkboxes are checked
[12:42:22] <jamey-uk> anew: because you haven't even got jQuery loaded… and you're trying to use a plugin that isn't in the core!?
[12:43:01] <caleb_io> anew: your framework on the left is mootools.. not jQuery, I'm sure jQuery is not loaded by default
[12:43:11] <jcrza> Hey guys. I'm completely new to js and jquery, so it's probably really simple, but can anybody spot the problem with this http://pastebin.com/71JUR9NS given the json at http://jordanzazzara.com/get_more_links
[12:43:11] <jax> jamey-uk: i can get all the checkboxes, but can i check if they are all checked?
[12:43:13] <anew> oh i thought it was... let me chang ethat
[12:45:36] <anew> hmm seems to be working now, why the hell is not working on my site then
[12:46:00] <caleb_io> are you loading jQuery on your site? ;)
[12:46:38] <anew> must be some strange loading problem... if u load jq twice does it screw things up ?
[12:47:14] <anew> no actually i have a test page with only this on it
[12:47:15] <anew> let me see
[12:47:46] <anew> btw what's the differenct btwn run and update on fiddle
[12:48:03] <tw2113> run executes what you have
[12:48:08] <tw2113> update saves to a new version
[12:48:11] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/Va57j/17/ actually why the heck do i have to click 'submit' twice for validation to appear???
[12:48:16] <tw2113> so that you can share your changes with someone else
[12:49:15] <rehandalal> anybody know how i can access the jquery ui docs? seem to be broken right now
[12:49:21] <green-_> is there something inherently bad about calling methods that animate w/in a loop? I have a bunch of list items I want to fadeout, but if I try to hide() or fadeOut() these elements one by one by looping through the UL children, the animation doesn't happen and there's a big delay
[12:49:27] <signal0r_> hey guys. is it possible to fade background color from #000 to #fff without jqueryUI.js?
[12:49:31] <tw2113> http://api.jqueryui.com/
[12:49:32] <fruitwerks> if anyone replied, I missed it, sorry
[12:49:54] <anew> hah, i was loading jquery.js after the lib

[13:02:18] <green-_> I can't seem to call fadeOut() via any method on a group of elements and have it behave properly
[13:02:26] <ajpiano> jaha: preventDefault doesn't stop propagation, stopPropagation() does
[13:02:26] <fruitwerks> unless you need a different scop for google to use groups requests, or every variant of the how to get a group feed is wrong I have no idea... the group id is correct as well
[13:02:43] <BillCriswell> jamey-uk: I know I can do <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://localhost/htdocs/site.com/style.css"> but if I could do it without getting into the HTML of it that would be awesome.
[13:02:50] <green-_> should $("#myUL li").fadeOut(); work properly? it just sits there doing nothing for a few seconds, then the <li>s blink out of existence
[13:02:59] <green-_> (meaning no fade, just disappear)
[13:03:05] <jamey-uk> BillCriswell: why would want to do it without modify the source? What are you trying to achieve?
[13:03:18] <jamey-uk> jax: any good?
[13:03:46] <jaha> ajpiano: touché,i mispoke, but preventDefault should still stop the "default" click event from firing
[13:04:00] <BillCriswell> jamey-uk: I'm working on a "hosted solution" so I need to upload all my changes to see them. I'd like to avoid that step till I have to.
[13:04:05] <ajpiano> ostensibly
[13:04:11] <ajpiano> what default action are you trying to prevent
[13:04:59] <therealklanni> Is there a way to get a list of all ajax requests being handled with jQuery.ajax (or subset), or do I have to maintain that myself?
[13:05:00] <jaha> just click $('body').on('click', selector, cb())
[13:05:12] <NoiseEee> fruitwerks: iirc, the errors you're getting about access control have to do with being successfully/unsuccessfully authenticating with google to use those services.
[13:05:13] <jaha> ajpiano: ^
[13:05:14] <BillCriswell> I was thinking a plugin where I can pick a file locally and have chrome observe while I work on it and apply the changes. Kind of like how you can do in chrome already.
[13:05:16] <jamey-uk> BillCriswell: in what context, a blog, a content management system? Can you input unfiltered HTML? CSS becomes messy when you don't do it properly.
[13:05:30] <ajpiano> jaha: what is the "Default" behaviour of a click on the body that you're trying to prevent
[13:05:33] <therealklanni> Or, is there a way to send all pending ajax requests and abort?
[13:05:43] <therealklanni> an*
[13:05:48] <BillCriswell> jamey-uk: I know.
[13:06:05] <jaha> ajpiano: its an A tag, so the href gets called
[13:06:08] <jamey-uk> BillCriswell: but that's not going to fix it remotely, only for you. You can use something like the Stylebot extension on Chrome but as I said it will only make the changes for you. You need to be able to modify the page itself on the server...
[13:06:22] <green-_> is it possible that calling fadeOut on a couple hundred items at a time simply makes the browser not animate nicely?
[13:06:25] <ajpiano> jaha: we'd need to see a testcase to verify
[13:06:47] <ajpiano> i haven't seen any bugs or heard any other complaints related to preventDefault not working properly in 1.8.2...
[13:06:53] <BillCriswell> jamey-uk: Haha I know that. This is just till I'm happy with it then I obviously upload the file.
[13:07:13] <giuliogiuseppega> a download event?
[13:07:24] <giuliogiuseppega> i need to fire something after download
[13:07:58] <jamey-uk> BillCriswell: gotcha, yeah I'd love to know about that plugin too, it must exist - I often edit things with the inspector and then want a diff of what I've just modified. Let me know if you find it!
[13:08:07] <Gho5t> I'm having issues attaching click handlers to <area> elements in Firefox. Is this a known issue?
[13:08:14] <BillCriswell> giuliogiuseppega: I'm not sure that's possible.
[13:08:22] <giuliogiuseppega> :(
[13:08:25] <therealklanni> jamey-uk: google chrome has that built in
[13:08:25] <BillCriswell> jamey-uk: Will do!
[13:08:36] <jamey-uk> therealklanni: it does? how do you get the diff out?
[13:08:45] <therealklanni> jamey-uk: it's not a "diff" per se, but you can view what's been changed
[13:08:50] <jamey-uk> how?
[13:08:59] <therealklanni> Gimme a sec, let me find you the video
[13:09:05] <jamey-uk> thanks
[13:09:43] <therealklanni> jamey-uk: http://paulirish.com/2011/a-re-introduction-to-the-chrome-developer-tools/
[13:09:56] <therealklanni> I believe that's the one
[13:10:02] <BillCriswell> Hmmm...
[13:10:06] <therealklanni> "revision history with save to disk functionality"
[13:10:15] <therealklanni> Pretty slick
[13:10:38] <BillCriswell> I wish I could work on it outside of the console but I guess working in the console isn't so bad.
[13:11:18] <jamey-uk> therealklanni: AWESOME
[13:11:20] <jamey-uk> thank you!
[13:12:07] <therealklanni> :)

[13:23:45] <xckpd7> is there anything that more simply explains $.when?
[13:24:33] <sunbeam> in a html responsive site i try to create i want the header to display/fill the full width/height of the browser screen
[13:24:38] <sunbeam> when any of the header nav links are clicked the site should reveal the rest of the content
[13:24:44] <sunbeam> and those header nav links should always be at the bottom of the screen
[13:24:47] <sunbeam> how can i best do this?
[13:24:50] <jedimind> with css
[13:24:50] <NoiseEee> http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/ @ xckpd7

[13:25:25] <envane> hi, i use a jquery ui datepicker on a  div, to make it display inline/always. the div is inside a table. somehow the scaling of the datepicker is fully off, icons are shown out of proortion etc. anyone know how to solve this?
[13:25:37] <tubbo> is it possible to add a callback to jqm.autoComplete which fires when 0 results are found?
[13:25:45] <envane> it shows as it should when i use it on an input
[13:26:05] <sethetter> Can i hook into the .keypress event for mobile devices?
[13:26:09] <NoiseEee> envane: fix your css?
[13:26:32] <sunbeam> jedimind: how ?
[13:26:46] <sunbeam> jedimind: i would need basically first, header always be height: 100%;
[13:26:55] <tubbo> sunbeam: #css can probably give you a better answer than here
[13:28:42] <sunbeam> sorry but i don
[13:28:52] <sunbeam> dont see how these effects can be accomplished without jquery
[13:29:46] <xckpd7> NoiseEee: that's what I'm talkin bout
[13:33:14] <tubbo> sunbeam: then you don't know enough about CSS3
[13:33:24] <envane> @Noise: yeah, but ... what :/ ... looking
[13:33:31] <tubbo> because jQuery is accomplishing this *with* CSS, that's how positioning and displady works on the web
[13:33:34] <tubbo> display*
[13:33:40] <tubbo> JS simply automates CSS directions
[13:34:01] <sunbeam> tubbo: yes
[13:34:04] <sunbeam> tubbo: i probably dont
[13:34:28] <sunbeam> tubbo: but thing is, when something is visible when a link 'header nav a' is clicked
[13:34:31] <sunbeam> can this be done with css3?
[13:34:45] <redsand> i have a portlet that's resizable but it wont resize the portlet-content
[13:35:02] <redsand> i tried using alsoResize
[13:35:39] <xckpd7> wait this makes no sense... $.when actually makes the ajax calls?
[13:35:57] <redsand> i also have a function o nthe resize event to resize it for me, but no luck, my content within the div stays same
[13:37:11] <BillCriswell> therealklanni: Have you tried the things in this video?
[13:38:04] <envane> which is why i like closure, at least there you can expect each component and library to expect a certain way, rather then to spend a lot of time with each custom jquery plugin to find out how it works
[13:40:23] <xckpd7> I was hoping that $.when was like a pubsub implementation...
[13:49:29] <trumpetmic> Good afternoon!  How would you go about doing this in jQuery:   Have a <select> that is displaced by an <input> after an <option> is chosen.
[13:51:32] <NoiseEee> trumpetmic: i'd hide the <select> and then show/create the <input> beside it
[13:51:52] <trumpetmic> thanks NoiseEee
[13:53:48] <gajus> is http://jsninja.com/ worth reading? for someone in advanced level, so to say.
[13:54:30] <awc737> why is it that after setCurrentPage() executes, the if statement does not? http://paste.laravel.com/8m0
[13:54:39] <jedimind> gajus, well its written by john resign
[13:54:43] <jedimind> so, probably
[13:55:15] <gajus> you mean the emo kid?
[13:55:35] <fkr1> Hey i have a problem with jquery and ajax (I use jQuery 1.8.2) if i make the ajax get request with jquery i get always an error (Without an error message) if i copy the url to a browser tab or with curl the request works perfect
[13:56:03] <caleb_io> is it an error from jQuery or an error from your application?
[13:56:31] <fkr1> oh wait do i have to setup something for crossdomain requests?
[13:56:46] <fkr1> its an error from jquery
[13:56:49] <hlve> Stupid question, but what does != mean?
[13:56:50] <fkr1> .fail is called
[13:57:03] <fkr1> hlve: not equals
[13:57:04] <caleb_io> does not equal
[13:57:13] <hlve> thanks
[13:57:16] <NoiseEee> fkr1: yes, either the server supports cross-domain (jsonP, access-origin) or you'll have to proxy there
[13:57:40] <fkr1> i have to call an external webservice
[13:57:56] <rmill> but what does !== MEAN
[13:58:01] <rmill> s'more STRICTer
[13:58:36] <caleb_io> checks against data type
[13:59:32] <caleb_io> fkr1 then the external web service needs to support jsonP or access-origin
[13:59:56] <caleb_io> otherwise you'll need to setup a proxy locally to fetch it from external web service.  then locally you'd fetch from your proxy.
[14:04:05] <sunbeam> does anyone know how come top: 10% doesn't work?
[14:06:04] <Gho5t> Can someone take a look at this and tell my why clicking on the area elements in firefox doesn't fire the click handler? http://jsfiddle.net/w9E4t/
[14:07:17] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: really, really, really, really, #css
[14:07:28] <jax> does a checkbox.prop('checked', true) run the change() method on that checkbox?
[14:08:01] <NoiseEee> jax: no, handlers only run when the user does an event
[14:08:10] <NoiseEee> jax: or you .trigger()  <vomit>
[14:09:50] <tubbo> jQuery Mobile = 100% useless
[14:10:51] <tubbo> ugh
[14:10:57] <tubbo> well at least jqm.autoComplete
[14:11:28] <fkr1> browser security concepts are 100% useless
[14:11:31] <jax> NoiseEee: so something like: find(':checkbox').trigger() ?
[14:11:44] <Nachtwind> hi, i have a _very_ basic question that i couldnt find answered or found any code to learn from... i have an object (sortable from jquery.ui) and want to have something happen on change ("change(event, ui)") - how do i add that to my code?
[14:11:46] <fkr1> why the hell says firebug always that the request has a status code of 200 but failed
[14:11:58] <anew> http://pastebin.com/ewwKDzbS i dont understand, if i wanted to join these two where art.id = $id... where do i put that part of the query here ?
[14:12:00] <NoiseEee> jax: .trigger('click');   http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[14:12:10] <jax> thx
[14:12:35] <Gho5t> Can someone take a look at this and tell my why clicking on the area elements in firefox doesn't fire the click handler? http://jsfiddle.net/w9E4t/
[14:13:16] <anew> oops wrog chanel lol
[14:14:46] <nchlssmith1> GhoSt: area? is it a class, id?
[14:15:28] <nchlssmith1> nvr i see its a tag
[14:16:09] <NoiseEee> Gho5t: it does work?
[14:16:16] <Gho5t> no
[14:16:19] <Nachtwind> http://pastebin.com/15nPkcYE      umm.... how do change the "change" part of the code to make it work?
[14:16:20] <NoiseEee> Gho5t: look at your console.
[14:16:23] <NoiseEee> i see 'yep'
[14:16:29] <Gho5t> in firefox?
[14:16:32] <Gho5t> I only see it in chrome
[14:17:41] <NoiseEee> Gho5t: indeed $('area') is null for FF; but imagemaps?
[14:17:59] <Gho5t> yeah I can't change that
[14:18:20] <Gho5t> so I guess there is a firefox bug then
[14:18:57] <NoiseEee> im not sure whats up there Gho5t; $('div'), $('img') all show null
[14:19:53] <NoiseEee> Gho5t: might actually just be a firebug bug.  http://jsfiddle.net/w9E4t/2/
[14:19:57] <black_warlock> how to select a <li> that has an <ul> within <li> and a <li> that has an empty <ul> (whitout <li>) ?
[14:20:22] <NoiseEee> Gho5t: sorry http://jsfiddle.net/w9E4t/3/
[14:21:10] <gnarf> black_warlock: i would avoid having to write that selector
[14:21:12] <gnarf> but
[14:21:24] <black_warlock> but i need it
[14:21:25] <gnarf> li:has(ul):not(:has(ul li))
[14:21:26] <Gho5t> NoiseEee: why won't it work in my external firebug
[14:21:34] <black_warlock> aff
[14:21:52] <Gho5t> and how the hell'd you get that in there
[14:22:08] <Gho5t> ah firebug lite
[14:22:35] <black_warlock> i have the simple selector ('li : has ul li') for the one is not empty
[14:22:57] <jax> what's wrong with: find('input[data-rel=checkbox-bundle]')
[14:23:11] <jax> ah typo. sorry.
[14:25:05] <Gho5t> man I thought i had replicated it
[14:25:12] <Gho5t> now I'm back to square 1 with this garbage
[14:26:18] <NoiseEee> Gho5t: just drop it. http://jsfiddle.net/w9E4t/4/  its obviously a(nother) issue with the latest FF/firebug
[14:26:36] <NoiseEee> Gho5t: specifically the console, and nothing to do with the event/selectors not working, as you can see ^^
[14:26:48] <black_warlock> gnarf doesnt work
[14:27:47] <Gho5t> NoiseEee: Yeah I gotcha. But alert() isn't working in my code either so it's something else
[14:27:57] <Gho5t> I've tried mucking with z-index on all of its ancestors
[14:27:59] <Gho5t> but no luck
[14:28:14] <gnarf> black_warlock: okay... the selector you want is just a bad practice in general
[14:28:16] <Gho5t> I can make it fire by doing $('area').eq(0).click();
[14:28:25] <Gho5t> but I can't hit it with my mouse
[14:28:38] <Gho5t> and you can't style these things in firefox so it's like grasping at straws
[14:28:40] <NoiseEee> Gho5t: then its got to be something specific with your code; the sample you provided in JSFiddle shows the event being fired with the mouse in FF when console.log is changed to alert
[14:28:43] <gnarf> black_warlock: and well, I have better things to do with my time than help someone do something the "wrong way" without any relevant info... see ?demo
[14:28:44] <bot-t> black_warlock, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:28:46] <gnarf> see ?p
[14:28:47] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:30:03] <gnarf> black_warlock: it sounds smelly, and I'd love to try to educate you on why -- usually you can do this another way.  Filter an existing selection of elements instead of trying to write it all in "one selector", etc
[14:30:29] <gnarf> $("li").filter(function() { return $(this).find("ul li").length; })
[14:30:31] <gnarf> for instance
[14:30:33] <black_warlock> oka
[14:30:44] <gnarf> but really
[14:30:48] <gnarf> why do you need this selection?
[14:31:32] <black_warlock> im understanding it already gnarf
[14:31:49] <black_warlock> the element is display blocking his parents
[14:32:01] <gnarf> black_warlock: then this is a css issue
[14:32:10] <gnarf> and not really something you should be solving in JS in the first place
[14:32:44] <black_warlock> im using the sortable ui
[14:33:24] <black_warlock> i think i understood how to do it
[14:35:47] <Nachtwind> i have a problem with http://pastie.org/5105662     all the sortable stuff works as intended.. but the change stuff wont fire. any ideas?
[14:36:21] <black_warlock> i have to solve it with CSS not with JS rite gnarf ?
[14:36:49] <gnarf> black_warlock: I don't know - I don't know the issue, maybe it is a JS thing, maybe not, all i know is you have some crazy selector
[14:36:51] <gnarf> :)
[14:37:06] <black_warlock> XD
[14:37:22] <gnarf> Nachtwind: it doesn't fire "change"
[14:37:33] <gnarf> Nachtwind: sortable fires "sortstop" i think...
[14:37:46] <gnarf> but you can bind it as an option to sortable
[14:41:26] <Nachtwind> ummm
[14:41:44] <Nachtwind> http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-change    i thought this would fire change? if now.. how would i add what you said?
[15:12:53] <w00tner> how can i post request an url sending two parameters ??
[15:12:59] <w00tner> name and email
[15:15:16] <ScottO__> anyone know what kind of nav menu Hulu uses?
[15:15:24] <ScottO__> seems they use jquery
[15:16:23] <w00tner>  im supposed to send this post request to an url sending two paramenters (name and email) with a value, and then im supposed to get a json file with the next step
[15:17:15] <gnarf> Nachtwind: pass the "change" callback in the options when you setup the sortable
[15:18:09] <Nachtwind> how do i do that? sorry.. i am pretty new to all this jquery stuff and cant really find my entrance to it
[15:19:38] <w00tner>  im supposed to send this post request to an url sending two paramenters (name and email) with a value, and then im supposed to get a json file with the next step

[16:11:59] <shoky> pseudo-json
[16:12:55] <shoky> why not-   data: {...}  without the " quotes
[16:14:24] <shoky> cause right now it's sending that whole string as an empty key
[16:15:27] <w00tner> oh ok thanks
[16:15:32] <w00tner> i will check it
[16:16:13] <shoky> ?g enable cors @ w00tner
[16:16:14] <bot-t> w00tner, enable CORS - http://enable-cors.org/
[16:16:21] <w00tner> thanks
[16:16:52] <w00tner> so i just need to enable CORS
[16:17:27] <shoky> that's the idea
[16:18:16] <shoky> well, assuming you're in control of the server
[16:19:25] <dblosevn> shoky: thats bad ass, is it xbrowser xplatform? or just html/webkit browsers that actually listen to the header?
[16:19:48] <dblosevn> *html5/webkit
[16:20:28] <shoky> dblosevn: IE<10 doesn't fully support it
[16:20:41] <dblosevn> i knew IE would be an issue
[16:20:53] <dblosevn> Ill stick to proxying my requests for a few more years or jsonp
[16:20:54] <shoky> IE8,9 need something extra for it (XDR transport)
[16:21:05] <shoky> IE<8 no go
[16:21:34] <dblosevn> i assume both servers have to send the header
[16:21:47] <dblosevn> otherwise an xss attack would be quite simple
[16:21:58] <shoky> what both servers?
[16:22:19] <dblosevn> server serving the page making the request as well as the remote resource being consumed
[16:22:44] <shoky> mm only the one being consumed needs a header, i think
[16:22:59] <dblosevn> most browsers wont even try if the request is xdomain
[16:23:09] <Ben^> Hey
[16:23:24] <dblosevn> firefox being the oddball sending an options request in place of the get or post
[16:23:55] <Ben^> With jquery custom function ($.fn), are vars in the function scoped to the instance of the function on an element, or scoped to the function in general?
[16:24:19] <dblosevn> id think the server serving the page would let the browser know it can consume resources form another domain and the other domain would conrim the permission when its requested
[16:24:34] <dblosevn> *confirm
[16:24:59] <shoky> i don't really know too much bout it
[16:25:21] <dblosevn> me neither neat idea though, lots better then crossdomain.xml
[16:26:19] <Ben^> like if I pass in some settings values when calling $(whatever).myplugin(settings), and I want the settings to persist on a later call, perhaps to a sub-method ($(whatever).myplugin("dosomething"), do I have to this.data() the settings internally to persist them on the plugin init
[16:26:50] <dblosevn> functions are enclosed in { } all vars are local inside of the { }
[16:27:18] <dblosevn> and persistant
[16:27:42] <Ben^> I guess what im asking is, does jquery route the subsequent calls to a plugin to the same initial function instance, thereby meaning that initialised vars persist for my plugin on that element only
[16:27:51] <shoky> Ben^: if you want to persist data related to the element(s) you're running the plugin functions on, then using .data() is the a good approach yea
[16:27:55] <shoky> -the
[16:28:19] <dblosevn> no its a new instance not the same object, every intance has its own copy of the vars
[16:28:26] <shoky> Ben^: a $.fn.function is just a function, like any other function. not jquery or anyone does anything special with it
[16:28:31] <MrPunkin> is there a way when loading content via ajax to wait until all rendered HTML has loaded to then do something? Say you load a list of images don't actually render the HTML until all the images are available?
[16:29:21] <dblosevn> can bind a dom ready event then render the images @ mrpunkin
[16:30:02] <MrPunkin> dblosevn: right, but DOM ready doesn't wait for image to load, and I'm talking partial content loaded with AJAX, not full pages.
[16:30:10] <shoky> Ben^: so when you call  $(whatever).myplugin(..)  it's just a regular function call (the function being $.fn.myplugin) , with the context (this) set to the result of $(whatever)
[16:31:04] <dblosevn> bind image.load instead then
[16:31:45] <Ben^> shoky ok, so basically unless you save the values of passed settings on the first $(whatever).myplugin(settings) then once the codebehind has run for myplugin(settings), the settings are lost
[16:32:04] <dblosevn> only issue with that is it will never fire if the image is pulled from cache MrPunkin
[16:32:50] <sgharms> I am trying to build a top-nav drop down menu using jQ.  I'm pretty new to front end development, so I'm not sure if I'm encountering a limit in my CSS knowledge or my understanding of the menu API, but can someone explain how to make the following fiddle behave such that mouse over "Item 3" "drops down" like a standard menu?
[16:32:55] <sgharms> Here's the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/sgharms/gWw8G/
[16:33:43] <shoky> Ben^: well yeah if you don't save it anywhere it'll be lost. donno what you mean by 'once the codebehind has run'
[16:34:05] <dblosevn> shoky: hes an aspne developer lol
[16:34:10] <dblosevn> *aspnet
[16:34:53] <shoky> yeah i figured, still donno what he means tho ;p
[16:35:09] <Ben^> shoky: Well you might define an init function that just runs on $(whatever).myplugin(settings), but there might be other functions you can run later like $(whatever).myplugin("somemethod", settings). Example jquery dialog methods open and close. In that example, open and close do not have access to any settings passed to the init function
[16:35:15] <dblosevn> Ben^: inside your constructor for the plugin youd do something like this, this.settings = settings;
[16:35:20] <Ben^> shoky: unless saved and restored
[16:35:23] <MrPunkin> dblosevn: Right, I'm aware of that, just was hoping for some way to monitor all content of a div like you would the body load event (which does take images into account) without having to re-render the whole page.
[16:35:26] <shoky> not this.settings = settings
[16:35:39] <Ben^> yeah thats bad dblsoven
[16:35:44] <shoky> that will not be persisted on the next call to $(selector).myplugin(...)
[16:35:50] <eph3meral> where's the docs for formatDate? http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-dateFormat doesn't link to them
[16:36:02] <eph3meral> and formatDate is not in the method list on the docs for datepicker
[16:36:06] <dblosevn> this.settings would refer to the current instance of the plugin
[16:36:30] <dblosevn> the constructor should only be called once when orginally creating the plugin
[16:36:41] <dblosevn> *binding the plugin to a dom element
[16:36:46] <shoky> yes
[16:37:08] <Ben^> I think I might just make my jquery plugin a wrapper around a classical fake 'class' function, then save the result and reuse it, ala this.data("myplugin", new myPluginClass())
[16:37:16] <dblosevn> all future references to the already bound instance of the pluygin could reference this.settings to get the original config
[16:37:16] <Ben^> then I can have persisted vars inside it
[16:37:33] <shoky> dblosevn: but you won't be able to access those settings if you run a new query
[16:37:53] <shoky> it'll only be saved on the return value from that first call to .myplugin
[16:38:25] <Ben^> does the method I suggested sound ok?
[16:38:42] <shoky> instead, do something more like  this.data('myplugin', {settings: settings, ...})
[16:39:21] <shoky> then even if you run with a new selector  $('.someclass').myplugin('changesetting', 'bla', 20)  or whatever
[16:39:23] <Ben^> I dont need to have a settings object in that case though, because internal vars will be scoped to the saved function reference on this.data("myplugin")
[16:39:40] <shoky> that call to .myplugin will be able to just retrieve the settings with a call to .data('myplugin')
[16:39:42] <Ben^> and I can just use settings for passing external options
[16:39:52] <awc737> is there anything wrong with this syntax: http://paste.laravel.com/8mC
[16:39:57] <awc737> the if statement does not execute, unless I put it before the other 2 lines
[16:40:01] <shoky> with  this.settings = settings  you'd have to only use that original return value
[16:40:25] <_zoggy_> anti ; ?
[16:40:50] <shoky> Ben^: yeah what you described is a common way to do it
[16:42:07] <awc737> anyone? tude doesn't use AMD, but the concepts in the slideshow still apply.
[16:42:08] <awc737> oops
[16:42:14] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/8mC
[16:42:20] <MistuhKurtz> Does anybody know of a mature, extendable gallery plugin like Galleriffic ( http://www.twospy.com/galleriffic/ )  or AD Gallery ( http://coffeescripter.com/code/ad-gallery/#ad-image-0 ) that can work with either images or DOM nodes? everything I find seems to be expecting only images and I need to be able to have a YouTube video as well
[16:44:05] <shoky> awc737 no errors in console?
[16:44:16] <awc737> no no errors
[16:44:25] <awc737> well
[16:44:30] <awc737> currentPage is not defined
[16:44:34] <shoky> well....
[16:44:40] <shoky> that is what i was aiming at ;)
[16:44:46] <awc737> I did if (currentPage) {
[16:44:54] <shoky> so?
[16:44:56] <awc737> still gives me that error
[16:45:03] <shoky> what error
[16:45:08] <awc737> currentPage is not defined
[16:45:26] <shoky> show the code..
[16:45:44] <TelFiRE> In the case of passing a function to animate(), should I be using paddingLeft and paddingTop?
[16:45:50] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/8mD
[16:48:12] <shoky> awc737: to check if a "bare" variable is defined you need:  if (typeof varname != 'undefined') { ...
[16:49:11] <TelFiRE> does top: '+=16' not work in IE or somethin? IE is behaving weird -_-
[16:50:29] <sasori> is this correct when getting the value if it's checked? var inhouse = $('inhouse').attr('checked').val();
[16:50:31] <shoky> awc737: btw, javascript stops running your script when the first error occurs
[16:50:46] <sunbeam> whats the best way to relatively have font sizes relative to the browser width?
[16:50:47] <sunbeam> ems is only relative to the body font
[16:51:18] <awc737> ok thanks shoky
[16:51:55] <w00tner> i sent a post request to an url but keep getting the content as "Content-Type:text/html" back from the server ... how can override the response headers in jquery ?
[16:52:51] <shoky> w00tner: the response content type is set by whoever sends the response, i.e. the server
[16:53:14] <w00tner> and how am i supposed to get the json data
[16:53:20] <w00tner> if its sending my like that
[16:53:28] <shoky> to tell jquery how to parse it, use  dataType: 'json'  for example
[16:53:48] <MistuhKurtz> or $.parseJSON()
[16:53:55] <w00tner> thanks
[16:53:58] <w00tner> let me try it
[16:57:25] <Ben^> shoky you still there?
[16:57:34] <shoky> Ben^: ya
[16:57:39] <Ben^> http://pastebin.com/KyTcHCHX
[16:57:41] <Ben^> this is what I meant
[16:58:19] <Ben^> basically a regular old 'class-like' function, with a jquery wrapper at bottom
[16:58:32] <Ben^> all the work is done in myPluginClass
[16:58:49] <sunbeam> when the browser width is changed, the css stylesheet should be reloaded (responsive) is there an easy way to do this?
[17:01:33] <TelFiRE> is there a reason to not just use media queries? It' sounds like a performance issue to reload the whole stylesheet every time the browser width changes :/
[17:01:40] <shoky> Ben^: it mostly looks fine, tho this looks odd to me:  return myPluginInstance.apply( myPluginInstance, newArgs );
[17:02:04] <w00tner> does this code works for you? : http://pastebin.com/pzQaXBQL
[17:02:29] <shoky> Ben^: hmm
[17:02:30] <Ben^> shoky, it transposes all the arguments except the first one sent to the jquery function to the function inside the plugin instance, and is sure to keek the plugin instance this equal to itself
[17:02:40] <Ben^> *keep
[17:02:54] <Ben^> I just hammered that out then from concept so it might have bugs
[17:03:00] <Ben^> but I think the idea works
[17:03:03] <Ben^> and is clean
[17:03:09] <shoky> but uhh myPluginInstance isn't a function
[17:03:16] <shoky> is it
[17:03:17] <shoky> ?
[17:03:24] <Ben^> its an object
[17:03:29] <shoky> so how can you .apply  it
[17:03:33] <Ben^> and you call apply on it to call its functions (if you want to set scope)
[17:03:38] <shoky> wat
[17:03:39] <Ben^> hmm maybe youre right
[17:03:42] <Ben^> should be
[17:03:52] <Ben^> myPluginInstance[method].apply(da da da)
[17:03:58] <w00tner> i keep getting this XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://csg-eng.ooyala.com/challenge/. Origin http://www.alcancetotal.com is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[17:04:02] <shoky> right
[17:04:09] <w00tner> i already disable the web security
[17:04:19] <w00tner> C:\Users\r00t\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe --disable-web-security
[17:04:31] <w00tner> the shorcut's destiny is like that
[17:12:21] <sunbeam> in a html responsive site i try to create i want the header to display/fill the full width/height of the browser screen
[17:12:25] <sunbeam> when any of the header nav links are clicked the site should reveal the rest of the content
[17:12:28] <sunbeam> and those header nav links should always be at the bottom of the screen
[17:12:31] <sunbeam> how can i best do this?
[17:25:30] <jcrza> So, I'm using .load to replace a div, how can I approach getting new content to slide in rather than just instantly replacing?
[17:29:29] <defaultro> you guys know of i18n api? I tried i18next and it's fine. I was hoping there are others I can try
[17:33:51] <Ben^> shoky: generalised version: http://pastebin.com/srW6Vgp0
[17:34:25] <w00tner> can you find anything wrong? http://pastebin.com/RPn2q9FZ
[17:34:32] <w00tner> im not getting any response OMG!!!
[17:35:42] <jugglinmike> jcrza: .load is a convenience method. To do something more customized, you'll want to retrieve the content with $.ajax, append it to a hidden container, and then animate it with .animate or .slideDown
[17:37:31] <jugglinmike> w00tner: is the error handler being called?
[17:39:34] <w00tner> yes
[17:39:47] <w00tner> i get the FAIL message
[17:40:13] <jugglinmike> Is this code running on the csg-eng.ooyala.com domain?
[17:40:24] <xSmurf> hey, I have an unrelated question but I  figure someone here might know... is there a way to get the browser to download an ArrayBuffer? ex: creating some sounds with the web audio api and then offering that sound for download to the user
[17:40:55] <xSmurf> aka like if the link had a "content-disposition" header to force download
[17:40:58] <w00tner> no, but i already disable web security
[17:41:02] <w00tner> for chrome
[17:41:09] <xSmurf> huh?
[17:41:25] <xSmurf> yeah I can see how something like this could "help" with drive by downloads ;)
[17:41:50] <xSmurf> apparently in ie there's execCommand('SaveAs') but I'm looking for webkit
[17:41:50] <jugglinmike> w00tner: Have you tested that you can make any cross-domain requests at all?
[17:42:19] <jugglinmike> it might be that the flag is not properly set
[17:42:32] <w00tner> if i change it to jsonp  it doesnt send any parameters, when i change it to json in datatype it sends the parameters but i get no response
[17:42:53] <jugglinmike> well that depends on how the backend is implemented
[17:43:02] <jugglinmike> it probably requires a post request
[17:43:35] <jugglinmike> xSmurf: the data will be raw PCM, so even if they download it, they may not have a means to play it back
[17:44:19] <w00tner> this is my code jugglinmike: http://pastebin.com/zy4HDiwq
[17:44:32] <gf3> smurfke: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/File_APIs
[17:44:34] <gf3> er
[17:44:38] <gf3> xSmurf: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/File_APIs
[17:45:09] <jugglinmike> w00tner: yes I can see that
[17:45:24] <w00tner> so what do you recommend me to check
[17:45:27] <xSmurf> jugglinmike: there are codec libraries ;)
[17:45:34] <xSmurf> also I'm thinking in general could be useful
[17:45:41] <xSmurf> for canvas/images too
[17:46:50] <xSmurf> gf3: thanks!
[17:47:11] <gf3> xSmurf: Basically very little support for writing
[17:47:19] <jugglinmike> w00tner: when I run that code from http://csg-eng.ooyala.com/challenge/, it completes successfully
[17:47:39] <xSmurf> gf3: I see :/
[17:49:40] <xSmurf> as a side note, any easy workaround for the lack of AudioAvailable event on <audio> in webkit that does not involve soundmanager2?
[17:52:45] <w00tner> what are you getting ?
[17:52:51] <w00tner> are you getting json data ?
[17:53:56] <w00tner> i got it
[17:56:39] <nezZario> where is the best place to place ("#foo').onkeypress(); etc events ? (or any other 'hook') ?
[17:56:54] <nezZario> obviously, in a script tag .. but i assume around a document ready, or something else?
[17:58:02] <gf3> nezZario: Well you could put it at the end of the <body>
[17:59:10] <danheberden> gf3, can i put you at the end of my body?
[17:59:24] <gnarf> ?ts
[17:59:24] <bot-t> That's Sexual™
[17:59:28] <gf3> danheberden: Let me just finish with the tip
[17:59:44] <danheberden> i like the sound of that
[18:00:02] <djj_> I have the following image As you will notice I have the date vertically starting from the 16th April going down to may 12. Horizontally are different hospitals. What I am trying to do is get the dates to be listed vertically
[18:00:11] <djj_> is something like this possible
[18:00:30] <djj_> pasting the url would be helpful --> http://i.imgur.com/bc1qs.png :-)
[18:00:55] <djj_> I looked at a few jquery calendars but none have been any useful
[18:02:38] <djj_> I was even thinking maybe i could use jquery event calendar (http://www.codfusion.com/blog/page.cfm/projects/event-calendar) and tweak it so that it shows the dates vertically or would this be too much headache
[18:06:30] <gmclelland> Can anyone tell me how to fade and height toggle the latest jqueryui tabs?  I used to be able to do
[18:06:31] <gmclelland> $('#tabContainer').tabs({
[18:06:32] <gmclelland>         fx: {
[18:06:34] <gmclelland>             height: 'toggle',
[18:06:35] <gmclelland>             opacity: 'toggle'
[18:06:37] <gmclelland>         },
[18:06:38] <gmclelland>         collapsible: true
[18:06:38] <gmclelland> });

[18:06:53] <gnarf> ?p
[18:06:54] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:07:05] <gnarf> don't paste code in IRC gmclelland
[18:07:22] <gmclelland> sorry
[18:07:28] <gnarf> gmclelland: i think the option name changed in 1.9
[18:07:29] <gnarf> but thats it
[18:08:09] <gnarf> like instead of "fx" its just the "hide" and "show" option now: http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#option-hide
[18:08:10] <gmclelland> yes it did http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#option-show
[18:08:47] <gmclelland> I tried same with hide and show, but it didn't seem to work
[18:09:31] <gnarf> gmclelland: you have to use an effect
[18:09:41] <gnarf> gmclelland: you could use "slideDown" and "slideUp"
[18:09:46] <gnarf> but if you really want the opacity too
[18:09:54] <gmclelland> Here is what I tried http://fixee.org/paste/up8dkhz/
[18:10:11] <gmclelland> I don't think there is an effect for toggle height and fade
[18:10:38] <gnarf> gmclelland: one minute, I'll write one
[18:11:54] <gmclelland> Here is an example I what I'm trying to do http://jsfiddle.net/gmclelland/HcJJZ/
[18:14:48] <gnarf> gmclelland: http://jsfiddle.net/HcJJZ/3/
[18:16:43] <gnarf> gmclelland: $.effects.setMode(el, o.mode || "show") just turns "toggle" into "show" or "hide"
[18:16:44] <gmclelland> gnarf: awesome, thank you so much
[18:17:09] <gnarf> gmclelland: np - sorry its not AS custom as the old format
[18:17:19] <gnarf> but i made writing an effect dead simple ;)

[18:23:27] <coldhead> thanks for your message, Girls_Escort
[18:23:34] <coldhead> i really enjoyed the time we spent together
[18:26:21] <eph3meral> omg, is there SERIOUSLY no date picker that can fucking handle different formats for display and for actually sending params? wtf? trent's picker sucks, anytime sucks, and those are basically the best and only options short of rolling my own :(
[18:27:00] <coldhead> dates are hard, man
[18:27:15] <gnarf> eph3meral: once UI tackles a rewrite it should be better
[18:27:15] <coldhead> i just tell my client that it can't be done and they should just organise everything via facebook
[18:27:19] <gnarf> but yeah
[18:27:24] <gnarf> dates are hard
[18:35:47] <cryptopsy> how to invert colors gradually? i.e. reverse the colors from black to white with a slide bar?
[18:35:52] <cryptopsy> for the whole page
[18:36:21] <ryanneufeld> gnarf wrote a color plugin, but I'm not sure how you'd do it for the whole page
[18:37:15] <gnarf> cryptopsy: that seems kinda crazy
[18:37:16] <gnarf> but
[18:37:36] <cryptopsy> ryanneufeld: how about for an image
[18:37:48] <gnarf> even crazier
[18:37:53] <ryanneufeld> cryptopsy: server side php/imagemagik would be my guess
[18:37:54] <gnarf> there isn't like an "invert" filter
[18:38:19] <gnarf> you could get clever with canvas prolly
[18:38:20] <gnarf> but
[18:38:22] <gnarf> like
[18:38:29] <gnarf> still seems crazy
[18:38:30] <gnarf> :)
[18:38:36] <ryanneufeld> oooh, yes, get some of that html5 goodness
[18:38:42] <ryanneufeld> cryptopsy: try #html
[18:39:57] <coldhead> oh too busy doing a demo to see the conversation had moved on :(
[18:40:06] <coldhead> cryptopsy: http://jsfiddle.net/uevLx/
[18:40:13] <coldhead> sorry i have failed you
[18:40:26] <coldhead> sorry everyone
[18:40:31] <coldhead> i wish i had never been born
[18:41:25] <cryptopsy> slow as fuck just for that square
[18:41:59] <cryptopsy> no limit on FPS?
[18:42:02] <cryptopsy> coldhead: ^
[18:42:14] <cryptopsy> imagine you slide it real fast, then it has to render like 500 frames in 1 second
[18:42:30] <coldhead> yes, look i can only apologise so many times
[18:42:41] <cryptopsy> its cool
[18:42:46] <coldhead> no, it's not cool
[18:42:52] <coldhead> and nothing will ever be "cool" again
[18:42:54] <cryptopsy> ive never used jfiddle
[18:43:22] <coldhead> someone has pissed on a biscuit and now i must eat the pissy biscuit
[18:43:25] <eip56> how do i get the height of only the viewable window?
[18:43:26] <gnarf> cryptopsy: what you want to do is just simply not an easy thing to do. you would have to read the original color/background color/hell gradients, images, etc
[18:43:30] <cryptopsy> are there any built-in FPS limits in rendering engines?
[18:43:40] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: are you having a moment?
[18:43:47] <coldhead> i'm good now, ryry
[18:43:49] <cryptopsy> gnarf: i would jut load it all as a canvas
[18:43:51] <coldhead> i'm "cool"
[18:43:54] * ryanneufeld hugs coldhead
[18:44:06] <gnarf> cryptopsy: yeah, have fun with "just" doing that
[18:44:10] <cryptopsy> web tech = miserable businesss
[18:44:15] <gnarf> cryptopsy: i hope you don't like easy things
[18:44:21] <gnarf> because this isn't one of em
[18:44:29] <cryptopsy> if i like easy things i would be fucking your mom
[18:44:38] <gnarf> unnessecary
[18:44:52] <gnarf> also, childish, and your last warning on this topic
[18:44:56] <cryptopsy> was it the vulgarity or the hatefulness of the messge?
[18:45:04] <gnarf> yes
[18:45:17] <cryptopsy> are you going to ban me?
[18:45:27] <gnarf> do you want me to ban you?
[18:45:30] <cryptopsy> n
[18:45:34] <gnarf> i was gonna convince coldhead to do it
[18:45:37] <coldhead> let's all be cool, chillun
[18:45:56] <coldhead> maybe if we take stock of everything that's gone wrong to get us to this point
[18:45:58] <cryptopsy> my only practical wishes are for you to not engage me at all
[18:46:01] <coldhead> first cryptopsy had a problem
[18:46:07] <coldhead> then i pissed on a biscuit
[18:46:14] <coldhead> now i am eating the pissy biscuit
[18:46:17] <gnarf> cryptopsy: in seriousness - "inverting" colors on a page is gonna be a hard thing to do
[18:46:19] <coldhead> and that's basically all i can remember
[18:46:21] <cryptopsy> ... and thats how the universe was created
[18:46:41] <cryptopsy> gnarf: np but my question about fps limit was serious
[18:47:07] <gnarf> cryptopsy: there aren't artificial limits, however you also can't expect it to be really performant if you are changing many properties at once
[18:47:26] <gnarf> it will end up doing crazy things like redrawing before you change everything to recalculate if you aren't careful
[18:47:58] <gnarf> there are some good talks on the performance of redraws and what they are by paul irish
[18:48:10] <gnarf> thats where most of my knowledge of the topic comes from
[18:48:16] <cryptopsy> me2
[18:48:48] <gnarf> and everything i know about it tells me to avoid needing to ask that question in the first place at all costs
[18:48:49] <gnarf> :)
[18:49:47] <ryanneufeld> cryptopsy: canvas is likely your best bet. Also comments about peoples mothers will get you nowhere in this channel. We're willing to help pretty much anyone who isn't a tool.
[18:50:20] <coldhead> i don't mind if people talk about my mother. she loves it. that's what i hear her saying last night to a young lothario. "i love it"
[18:53:06] <coldhead> ?eval ~ 7
[18:53:09] <bot-t> coldhead: -8
[18:54:01] <gnarf> ?eval lol @coldhead
[18:54:01] <bot-t> coldhead: ReferenceError: lol is not defined

[18:55:40] <bot-t> gnarf: "lol"
[19:02:24] <shodan45> how are you supposed to call methods on jquery UI objects?
[19:02:43] <nezZario> well this is fully lame
[19:02:52] <nezZario> for some reason IE8 .onkeypress for an <input isn't working
[19:05:35] <shodan45> I have a (working) jquery ui 1.9 tooltip that I want to open/show on a specific event, but I can't figure out how to fsckin' call methods on it :(
[19:06:29] <shodan45> unless I keep a reference to the tooltip object returned from .tooltip() somewhere? but that's powerfully lame...
[19:09:11] <gnarf> shodan45: tooltip has an "open" method that takes an element i think
[19:09:13] <gnarf> lemme check
[19:09:30] <gnarf> yeah
[19:09:39] <gnarf> elem.tooltip( "open" )
[19:09:43] <gnarf> http://api.jqueryui.com/tooltip/#method-open
[19:11:52] <shodan45> gnarf: yep. tried that... get long error message in FF
[19:12:34] <shodan45> gnarf: "cannot call methods on tooltip prior to initialization"
[19:13:02] <gnarf> shodan45: .tooltip().tooltip("open")
[19:13:11] <gnarf> it needs to be initialized before you open
[19:13:20] <gnarf> usually you'd .tooltip() sometime before
[19:13:24] <gnarf> then .tooltip("open")
[19:14:26] <shodan45> gnarf: right, I have called .tooltip before
[19:14:49] <shodan45> hm, not getting an error now, but not working either :(
[19:15:08] <gnarf> shodan45: honestly, i didn't do much research on tooltip in that use case
[19:15:15] <gnarf> i've only used tooltip as like the delegated case
[19:16:06] <gnarf> it doesn't appear we have a demo of the "non-delegated" case either
[19:16:55] <shodan45> gnarf: by "we" you mean you're a jquery ui dev?
[19:17:15] <gnarf> actually shodan45 http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/#forms
[19:17:18] <gnarf> shodan45: yes
[19:17:40] <gnarf> shodan45: there is a demo there where the "show help" button calls open
[19:18:21] <shodan45> gnarf: then I'd like to go on the record as saying .tooltip().tooltip('methodname') is fugly ;p
[19:18:34] <shodan45> imho of course ;)
[19:18:43] <gnarf> shodan45: so like the use case is more like
[19:19:00] <gnarf> var someTippedElement = $("#theelement").tooltip();
[19:19:03] <gnarf> then sometime later in a handler
[19:19:09] <gnarf> someTippedElement.tooltip("open")
[19:19:23] <gnarf> like the "direct chain" is uncommon
[19:19:28] <gnarf> but it also makes sense
[19:19:42] <gnarf> as much as it is a little duplication of code
[19:19:53] <gnarf> the first call to a widget must be "options"
[19:20:04] <gnarf> any further calls can then be methods
[19:21:19] <shodan45> gnarf: I'm still in the dark on why tooltip has "items"
[19:21:36] <gnarf> shodan45: so the common use case for tooltip
[19:21:37] <gnarf> is more like
[19:21:46] <gnarf> $(document).tooltip({ items: "[title]" });
[19:22:01] <gnarf> and it adds tooltips to anything with a title inside the whole document now or in the future via delegation
[19:22:12] <gnarf> sadly, there is no method to "open" then
[19:22:25] <gnarf> I was working on an extension for this
[19:22:30] <gnarf> were you could do like
[19:22:34] <shodan45> ok... here's my use case:
[19:22:37] <gnarf> $(document).tooltip( "pop", element );
[19:22:55] <gnarf> but got it kinda working in my app and forgot to release it
[19:22:58] <gnarf> :)
[19:23:26] <shodan45> I have a little icon that when you hover over it, it shows a tooltip
[19:24:01] <gnarf> does it have a title attribute?
[19:24:17] <shodan45> I also have a form field next to the icon. I want to show the tooltip *also* when the field has focus (and goes away on blur).
[19:24:42] <shodan45> gnarf: actually no, this is a <span>tooltip content here</span>
[19:25:08] <shodan45> with css to make that span only show a small icon instead of the content
[19:25:09] <gnarf> shodan45: can you put together a short demo of what you've got in a jsfiddle ?
[19:25:24] <gnarf> ?demo
[19:25:24] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:25:35] <shodan45> eh, I'll try...
[19:25:38] <gnarf> i can prolly get you the rest of the way there with tooltip
[19:26:02] <gnarf> but tbh, without really knowing the internals of the html/situation its kinda hard to think it through
[19:26:37] <Logikos> might someone tell me why the .fadeIn isnt changing the opacity as expected at the end of the javascript code block in http://jsfiddle.net/LYkmj/4/ please
[19:27:33] <shodan45> gnarf: I understand, but really my problem is simple: I want to programatically show a tooltip that's already there & works.
[19:27:39] <Logikos> i realize that code is alot of work to acomplish a simple thing, its designed that way however for a far more complex situation .. this is just testing/troubleshooting
[19:28:09] <gnarf> shodan45: i know - the solution will be pretty simple too, but its one of those things without the use case of your html its hard to craft the right solution
[19:29:30] <gnarf> shodan45: i've used a pretty similar scenario with tooltip, but I'd rather solve the problem in a fiddle for you and explain what I did than try to think of what possibly might be wrong in code I don't see :)
[19:30:50] <Logikos> nevermind, switched to .fadeTo instead of .fadeIn/.fadeOut .. however it doesnt explain why .fadeIn wasnt working .. at least now it works
[19:33:02] <gnarf> Logikos: so, .fadeIn only works on truely hidden elements
[19:33:05] <gnarf> like display: none
[19:33:32] <gnarf> fadeOut/In/Toggle only go from 0(none)->1(block/inline/whatever)
[19:34:20] <gnarf> if its opacity 0 but has a display other than "none" it's still "shown" so "fadeIn" is a noop
[19:35:31] <gnarf> shodan45: the use case you have is more like http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/#custom-content
[19:35:34] <gnarf> than the other demos
[19:35:58] <gnarf> in that you will likely need a custom "items" (things that have tooltips selector) and "content" functions
[19:36:19] <shodan45> gnarf: what's the easiest way to add jquery ui to jsfiddle?
[19:36:48] <gnarf> code.jquery.com/ui/1.9.0/jquery-ui.js
[19:37:06] <gnarf> or base off of http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/NmLck/ if you want "edge"
[19:37:23] <shodan45> gnarf: yeah, found the code. url 2 seconds later...
[19:39:36] <shodan45> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/J7eQ2/
[19:39:57] <shodan45> sorry about some of the formatting, was trying to go fast
[19:41:52] <gnarf> shodan45: http://jsfiddle.net/J7eQ2/1/
[19:41:59] <gnarf> better yet tho:
[19:43:25] <gnarf> shodan45: http://jsfiddle.net/J7eQ2/3/
[19:43:25] <shodan45> gnarf: see I still don't get how it's supposed to work... what's the point of the original jquery selector?
[19:43:38] <shodan45> it seems to be re-inventing the wheel?
[19:43:45] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/J7eQ2/4/
[19:43:53] <gnarf> thats the "original selector"
[19:44:00] <gnarf> the ones inside the "form" get the tooltip
[19:44:05] <gnarf> its delegation
[19:44:28] <gnarf> if you put some outside, it doesn't
[19:44:29] <gnarf> often
[19:44:40] <gnarf> this is why its $( document ).tooltip(...)
[19:45:19] <gnarf> so the whole document, any mouseenter/focusin event that matches on some "items" selector pops a tooltip
[19:46:10] <shodan45> gnarf: I guess it just "feels" quite different from the other jquery ui widgets
[19:46:18] <gnarf> it is VERY different
[19:46:25] <shodan45> lol ok
[19:46:33] <gnarf> tooltip isn't really an "instance" thing
[19:46:34] <gnarf> ever
[19:46:44] <gnarf> you could use it like one
[19:46:47] <gnarf> obviously
[19:46:57] <gnarf> but usually you want this "generic" case
[19:47:25] <gnarf> I totally perverted tooltip in my codebase by now
[19:47:29] <gnarf> made a new widget out of it
[19:47:48] <gnarf> because we wanted the ability to use the tooltip as an "error field" too
[19:48:13] <gnarf> so like if someone wasn't valid in the form, the tooltip showed up and stayed up
[19:48:31] <gnarf> I should clean it up and put it out there
[19:49:56] <gnarf> shodan45: all the other jQuery UI widgets are very representing of a SINGLE element on the page, where tooltip can work delegated, which makes for some super clean simple use cases
[19:51:28] <shodan45> gnarf: then it should be called .tooltips(), not .tooltip() ;)
[19:52:07] <gnarf> shodan45: lemme code up an alternate quick tho the other way
[19:52:52] <shodan45> gnarf: so I think I "get it" a bit more now, but I still don't understand why my code didn't work, or how to call any methods on tooltip
[19:53:17] <shodan45> btw, when was UI 1.9 released?
[19:53:39] <gnarf> shodan45: look at the first line of the source :)
[19:53:40] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/J7eQ2/5/
[19:53:43] <gnarf> so like
[19:53:47] <gnarf> thats the "open" method
[19:54:15] <shodan45> gnarf: today?!
[19:54:20] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/J7eQ2/7/
[19:54:31] <shodan45> or is that the date when the .zip was made?
[19:54:36] <gnarf> the 5th
[19:54:51] <gnarf>  /*! jQuery UI - v1.9.0 - 2012-10-05
[19:56:47] <shodan45> gnarf: interesting... not sure why that works & mine didn't, but it shows that I don't want that anyway - the tooltip can show up over the <input>
[19:57:40] <gnarf> shodan45: thats why i took the "wrapper" approach
[19:57:44] <gnarf> where i put it in the span
[19:57:50] <gnarf> so the whole span was the "tipped" thing
[19:57:57] <gnarf> in /5/
[19:58:14] <gnarf> er
[19:58:19] <gnarf>  /4/
[19:58:34] <gnarf> you can actually get tricky with it too
[19:58:43] <shodan45> hmm ok
[19:58:59] <shodan45> that's be a PITA with my current markup tho
[19:59:09] <gnarf> shodan45: http://jsfiddle.net/J7eQ2/8/
[19:59:16] <Logikos> i'm trying to create a global varable from a varable containing the name of the global var i want ... such as $(document).ready(function(){ var name = containerClass + n; window[name] = 'blah'; });  .. but it does not seem to create it...
[19:59:35] <gnarf> shodan45: now the input stops the event from propagating up so it only shows when you focus the input, not when you mouseenter/leave it
[19:59:54] <gnarf> althought that gets a little buggy
[19:59:55] <gnarf> still
[19:59:59] <gnarf> kinda shows how it works
[20:00:30] <gnarf> shodan45: you could do the "wrap" in javascript too
[20:00:35] <Logikos> well, in the example, assume containerClass is set to 'foo' and n = 0 .. then in console if i type window['foo0'] .. its undefined
[20:00:43] <gnarf> shodan45: whats the html actually look like atm?
[20:01:37] <gnarf> Logikos: sounds bad
[20:01:45] <gnarf> don't try to do that
[20:01:56] <gnarf> but
[20:01:59] <gnarf> having said that
[20:02:00] <gnarf> it should work
[20:03:10] <gnarf> Logikos: if it doesn't work, those variables either aren't what you think they are when that code runs, or something similar... try debugging with a breakpoint - see ?ftj
[20:03:11] <bot-t> Logikos, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[20:04:36] <Logikos> i think it failed only because its in a jsfiddle, which is in an iframe ... so if from console i try to reference the var ... its not set
[20:04:52] <shodan45> gnarf: the simple fields look like that
[20:04:52] <gnarf> Logikos: in chrome there is a drop down that lets you select the "result" frame
[20:04:54] <Logikos> i'll need ot do a local test to verify but when i use alert() from within the js code itself it seems to work as expected
[20:05:10] <Logikos> gnarf firebug doesnt have a similar feature?
[20:05:20] <gnarf> Logikos: http://cl.ly/image/2E113h1U3R2b
[20:05:24] <gnarf> Logikos: i'm unsure
[20:05:28] <gnarf> Logikos: i use chrome
[20:05:41] <gnarf> i'm sure it has it
[20:05:47] <Logikos> yeah
[20:05:49] <Logikos> thanks gnarf
[20:24:22] <adrian> hello
[20:25:00] <Guest28341> can someone tell me why the first click on my folding list doesn't slide up the default open section? after that first click all subsequent clicks behave how i like.

[20:28:03] <deweydb> nevermind
[20:28:04] <deweydb> i got it
[21:16:29] <raj> if ($('.something').find('#somethingelse').length) { /*do something*/ } ?
[21:16:33] <raj> is that correct?
[21:16:36] <raj> to use .length
[21:16:39] <raj> or is there another way?
[21:18:06] <RonWhoCares> I am wondering if there is a way to do math with Jquery + php + mysql   --- the application is updating a ledger.  The user is typing in a dollar value.  I want to query the current bank account balance and update it.
[21:18:15] <coldhead> length is how i would do it, raj
[21:18:50] <coldhead> maybe more like if ( $('.something #somethingelse').length > 0 )
[21:18:54] <gnarf> raj: yes, thats common to use .length as a "if i found this thing"
[21:19:00] <raj> cool
[21:19:03] <raj> thank you
[21:19:10] <Cork> RonWhoCares: sure, you can do math in js
[21:19:13] <gnarf> coldhead: > 0 is just more explicit, but no different
[21:19:19] <Cork> RonaldLokers: if thats your question
[21:19:34] <Cork> *RonWhoCares:
[21:19:37] <gnarf> coldhead: unless there were a negative result, like an imaginary number
[21:19:40] <RonWhoCares> Cork: What do I search for exactly to find an example on Google
[21:19:41] <raj> just trying to brush up
[21:19:47] <RonWhoCares> Cork: This is my first time
[21:19:50] <Cork> RonWhoCares: example for what?
[21:19:56] <raj> step away for a few months and i get totally rusty
[21:20:06] <RonWhoCares> Cork: I don't know how to do math with JQuery
[21:20:09] <Cork> var sum = old - change;
[21:20:24] <coldhead> gnarf: my version neatly escapes me having to explain to nobbs what .length returns
[21:20:33] <coldhead> noobs* oops
[21:20:36] <coldhead> sorry nobbs
[21:20:45] <RonWhoCares> Cork: I don't know how to involve my database query to find out the current account balance
[21:20:48] <gnarf> coldhead: +1
[21:21:06] <Cork> RonWhoCares: make an ajax call and fetch the current value

[21:22:56] <azbyin> hi all..
[21:23:31] <Cork> RonWhoCares: additionally it will give you typed data, so you don't have to convert from string
[21:24:15] <azbyin> how would i remove every *thing* (div/p/any_tag) that does not have an id="abd" or id="def" from within a div with id="alpahbetgroups"  ?
[21:25:17] <Cork> azbyin: $('#alpahbetgroups').html($('#abd, #def'))
[21:25:42] <azbyin> shouldn;'t there be a 'not' somewhere?
[21:25:48] <Cork> no
[21:25:52] <azbyin> i want to remove everything but those 2 groups
[21:26:02] <Cork> that replaces everything in the element except those two elements
[21:26:14] <Cork> (and there children)
[21:26:29] <azbyin> ah.. this is specifically setting the html.. ok will the styling be preserved for those 2 groups?
[21:26:29] <aaronfay> azbyin: his code does what you want
[21:26:51] <aaronfay> azbyin: of course
[21:26:52] <azbyin> i.e. i already have placved those 2 groups in certain positions within the alphabetgroups div
[21:27:14] <azbyin> ok, so no change visibly other than getting rid of everything other than the ones i want to keep
[21:27:15] <azbyin> thanks
[21:27:25] <Cork> azariah: it empties the element and appends the elements from the selector
[21:27:33] <Cork> so its the same dom element that was there before
[21:27:50] <azbyin> Cork, azbyin :)
[21:49:11] <danheberden> if you were a prototype, would you inherit from yourself? Hmm? Would ya?
[21:53:47] <azbyin> Cork, within one of those #abc and #def groups divs i actualy have a button that has a callback assigned to it.
[21:54:18] <azbyin> after i do $("#alphabetgroups").html("#abc,#def");  the callback is not triggered anymore!
[21:55:09] <RonWhoCares> Cork: I have another question.  Is there a way, besides [submit] for the bank account balance to update?  Like if I [tab] out of the field could it be updated?  Or how would you do it?  I am familiour with this line of code ... wondering how you would do it:   $('#submit').click(function(){
[21:55:37] <azbyin> RonWhoCares, you can tie the focus out event to a callback
[21:55:52] <azbyin> and update whatever needs to be updated on moving away from the form field
[21:58:08] <danheberden> azbyin: wat? $("#alphabetgroups").html("#abc,#def");
[21:58:27] <danheberden> what are you trying to do?
[21:58:39] <azbyin> thats just an example
[21:58:48] <azbyin> you want the correct div names, etc.?
[21:59:06] <danheberden> no, like, what are you trying to accomplish
[21:59:37] <gnarf> azbyin: so
[21:59:44] <aaronfay> azbyin: since the elements were moved, you would need to re-register the click event
[21:59:47] <gnarf> azbyin: when you use .html() it .remove()'s which unbinds events
[22:00:02] <azbyin> bah.. can i detach and then reinsert?
[22:00:19] <danheberden> cuz i looks like you want to $('#whatever').filter(function(){ return !$(this).is('#abc,#def'); }).remove();
[22:00:28] <gnarf> azbyin: yeah, you could actually $('#alpahbetgroups').html($('#abd, #def').detach());
[22:00:37] <gnarf> azbyin: just cuz of order they resolve
[22:00:56] <gnarf> detatch happens then, html calls .empty() which calls the .remove() on everything else
[22:01:11] <gnarf> and then finally appends the detached elems
[22:01:55] <gnarf> $("#whatever").children().not("#abc,#def").remove() is another option
[22:02:05] <gnarf> assuming abc and def are direct children of whatever
[22:02:15] <gnarf> but otherwise the .detach() is prolly fastest
[22:02:28] <danheberden> oy, heh, meant the children() in mine too, lol
[22:02:36] <azbyin> yes, they are direct children.. to me the detach->empty->append seems like it would be the fastest
[22:02:44] <danheberden> always a catch22 - drinking bourbon lands me in here, but makes me utterly useless
[22:02:44] <gnarf> why filter!is dan? ... not :)
[22:03:00] <danheberden> i don't do this kind of dom shit anymore gnarf, you know that :p
[22:03:15] <gnarf> danheberden: yeah, i dunno the last time i did something this strange either :)
[22:03:16] <danheberden> funny how writing app with mv* and templates rids you of this pain
[22:03:33] <Cork> RonWhoCares: you would have to do a ajax call to the server for the date to be stored
[22:03:49] <Cork> RonWhoCares: theres no magic, if you want the server to know, you have to tell it
[22:04:23] <gnarf> azbyin: might read better for further maintainers if you did: var keep = $("#abc,#def").detach();  $("#whatever").empty().append(keep);
[22:04:47] <azbyin> thats what i wanted to do in the first place..
[22:05:07] <azbyin> then thought i could be fancy and use filter or not, etc. to do the thingy
[22:05:19] <gnarf> .html() === .empty().append()
[22:05:26] <RonWhoCares> Cork: $("#dollar_value").focusout(function() {    is that right, with the <input id="dollar_value"
[22:05:35] <gnarf> azbyin: sometimes the simple is the fancy
[22:05:36] <gnarf> :)
[22:05:41] <azbyin> yeah.. :)
[22:06:27] <gnarf> anywhos
[22:06:30] <gnarf> past my bed time
[22:06:39] <Cork> RonWhoCares: yes
[22:06:40] <danheberden> nn
[22:06:44] <gnarf> not really, but I should be asleep
[22:06:55] <gnarf> danheberden: sexy
[22:07:54] <raj> any harm in redeclaring a variable when redifining it?
[22:07:59] <raj> within the same scope
[22:08:24] <danheberden> it's useless to redeclare
[22:08:28] <gnarf> raj:  the letters "var" only ever appear once in any function i write
[22:08:31] <danheberden> assigning to it is acceptable
[22:08:42] <raj> k
[22:08:54] <raj> just seemed cleaner to do in this situation I guess
[22:08:54] <danheberden> e.g.; var foo = "bar"; ... and later ...  foo = "ERRMAHGERD";
[22:08:59] <raj> looks-wise
[22:09:33] <danheberden> raj, but `var foo = 5` and elsewhere `var foo = "string"` gets interpreted as `var foo;` and then later... `foo = 5; foo = "String"`
[22:09:43] <danheberden> so regardless, your var declaration gets hoisted
[22:09:57] <gnarf> raj: sounds like if that is the case, there is probably some other smell
[22:10:09] <gnarf> like the function body is too long
[22:10:12] <danheberden> also, unlike gnarf, i support using multiple var statements
[22:10:12] <RonWhoCares> Cork: How does this look :   http://jsfiddle.net/uwN5Z/    Am I on the right idea
[22:10:30] <gnarf> danheberden: i don't mind multiple 'var' if they all at top
[22:10:34] <danheberden> gnarf, aye
[22:10:58] <gnarf> uglify optimizes that
[22:11:04] <Cork> RonWhoCares: http://jsfiddle.net/uwN5Z/1/
[22:11:08] <Cork> but yes that would work
[22:11:12] <gnarf> and using "var " or a 4stop tab is similar
[22:11:13] <danheberden> gnarf aye
[22:11:16] <gnarf> just , vs ; at that point
[22:11:50] <gnarf> i also try really really hard to not need many vars in scope
[22:12:21] <raj> cool
[22:12:25] <gnarf> i'm so paranoid of accidentally holding a ref to garbage somewhere
[22:12:31] <raj> thanks for the advice :)

[22:12:58] <abjorn> oh twitter u so clevr
[22:13:09] <abjorn> that joke almost went right over my head!
[22:13:19] <gnarf> abjorn: :)
[22:13:38] <gnarf> because you were high?
[22:13:52] <abjorn> because i got high
[22:13:54] <abjorn> because i got high
[22:13:56] <abjorn> because i got hiiiigh
[22:14:00] <gnarf> i ran sound for afroman
[22:14:02] <gnarf> twice
[22:14:06] <abjorn> niice
[22:14:10] <gnarf> when he played at the club i worked at
[22:14:15] <gnarf> fun show
[22:14:20] <gnarf> he's a decent guitar player too
[22:14:21] <gnarf> :)
[22:14:43] <nezZario> gnarf, you from MS?
[22:14:57] <danheberden> yeah but did he understand prototypal inheritance gnarf?
[22:15:02] <abjorn> so my work gave me a laptop...and it's a macbook pro. Being a Windows/Linux user...not impressed, yo
[22:15:02] <danheberden> HMMMM?
[22:15:06] <gnarf> nezZario: MS? if thats a state--- I'm in IL :)
[22:15:06] <abjorn> that's the impotrant part
[22:15:11] <abjorn> important, even
[22:15:13] <danheberden>  /kick abjorn
[22:15:30] <nezZario> afroman is from mississippi .. where i grew up ;)
[22:15:35] <abjorn> danheberden: it's a bunch of really quality hardware with a really shit operating system installed
[22:15:47] <gnarf> abjorn: eh - give it a year and you'll be in love :)
[22:15:48] <nezZario> my mom got his autograph in a grocery store once (we thought it was funny my mom knew who he was..) =)
[22:15:49] <abjorn> unfortunately I cannot install a different one :|
[22:15:54] <danheberden> abjorn, yeah, i absolutely hate having a good terminal built into the os
[22:16:09] <danheberden> cuz using git and other command line stuff on windows is a dream
[22:16:10] <abjorn> yeah because it's not like linux has that or anything
[22:16:12] <danheberden> :D
[22:16:18] <abjorn> I main linux for work
[22:16:22] <gnarf> abjorn: i've been using OS X since before it was OS X
[22:16:27] <abjorn> windows just for, you know, gaming
[22:16:29] <danheberden> but it's like the best of both worlds!
[22:16:29] <gnarf> linux before that
[22:16:40] <danheberden> i've thought about switching to just linux
[22:16:50] <abjorn> not really, cause OSX no longer even has the usability part of it, the window manager is quite literally the worst I've ever seen
[22:17:03] <gnarf> abjorn: s/worst/best
[22:17:05] <abjorn> I'd rather use like, fuckin vanilla X11 or xmonad or something completely non-user friendly
[22:17:08] <abjorn> pls
[22:17:15] <abjorn> maximizing windows doesn't even maximize them most of the time
[22:17:19] <aaronfay> this conversation just got hilarious
[22:17:20] <abjorn> that's a shit window manager
[22:17:28] <gnarf> abjorn: who maximizes?
[22:17:35] <gnarf> abjorn: use fullscreen if you want fullscreen
[22:17:36] <danheberden> abjorn, if you like to do that kind of stuff, i highly recommend bettertouchtool
[22:17:43] <abjorn> who FULLSCREENS?
[22:17:44] <gnarf> also, thats hackable
[22:17:48] <danheberden> like, if you have to use your mac
[22:17:49] <gnarf> abjorn: <--- this person
[22:17:55] <danheberden> it gives you aero style window snapping
[22:17:56] <abjorn> you foool
[22:18:04] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/0V0w3c0u3F1o
[22:18:04] <danheberden> and makes full screen maximizing awes
[22:18:17] <danheberden> also half screen
[22:18:25] <danheberden> and better mouse gestures
[22:18:28] <gnarf> abjorn: I also terminal with like a 22 pt font
[22:18:33] <abjorn> y
[22:18:35] <gnarf> because im blind
[22:18:39] <danheberden> WE ARE OLD ABJORN
[22:18:47] <abjorn> i imagine 22 pt font helps with blindness
[22:18:53] <abjorn> I'll ask the blind perl programmer at work
[22:18:56] <gnarf> actually because i like the classic 130ish column view
[22:19:01] <abjorn> actually rofl ive seen his screen and the font is legitimately huge on it
[22:19:08] <abjorn> not that it helps him much
[22:19:11] <gnarf> my editor is at 19pt
[22:19:17] <gnarf> but it changes daily
[22:19:24] <abjorn> I think I'm at 11
[22:19:29] <gnarf> depending on the last time i had to edit a wide file
[22:19:39] <gnarf> and/or give a presentation
[22:19:53] <ryanneufeld> I'm at 13pt
[22:19:57] <gnarf> abjorn: also --- pbcopy and pbpaste for the win
[22:20:00] <ryanneufeld> bit it changes
[22:20:24] <gnarf> abjorn: also, os x's applescript is suprisingly awesome for automation hacking
[22:20:31] <gnarf> because like every app is scriptable
[22:20:41] <abjorn> >applescript
[22:20:42] <abjorn> gross :(
[22:20:43] <gnarf> i hate the language
[22:20:45] <gnarf> but whatever
[22:20:46] <gnarf> it works
[22:20:48] <abjorn> lol
[22:21:04] <gnarf> prototype some crazy behaviors out of a launcher like alfred too
[22:21:24] <abjorn> the osx terminal pisses me off sometimes :| but that's just because it's BSD and is actually POSIX compliant, so I get thrown for a loop cause I'm used to linux
[22:21:33] <abjorn> even after like 8 months of working with osx it still throws me off
[22:22:01] <abjorn> not a legitimate problem with the OSX but god damn it's annoying lol
[22:22:13] <abjorn> COLDHEAD
[22:22:15] <abjorn> ARE YOU AWAKE
[22:22:18] <gnarf> abjorn: in this day in age --- VMs
[22:22:21] <abjorn> (caps makes him hear it)
[22:22:31] <abjorn> well hopefully they'll let me install a VM soon
[22:22:37] <abjorn> fuckin work laptops
[22:22:41] <abjorn> gotta get permission n shit
[22:22:55] <gnarf> abjorn: let you? BS - grab virtualbox and spin yerself a linux for when you want linux
[22:23:00] <gnarf> :)
[22:23:21] <gnarf> abjorn: its hard to imagine any company would be against a dev running VMs
[22:23:35] <abjorn> you'd think so :| when it comes to free software they're usually okay with it but they explicitly said they were going to setup VMs for us and didn't want us to do it because it's not like we, as programmers, know a thing or two about IT
[22:23:46] <gnarf> VM = privilege sandbox
[22:24:17] <abjorn> we have administrator access on these laptops, I can normally install any free software without asking but :|
[22:24:18] <abjorn> owel
[22:24:41] <beachandbytes> just format and reinstall
[22:25:00] <abjorn> I mean, I suppose, if I wanted to get fired.
[22:25:00] <gnarf> abjorn: yeah, policy sucks
[22:25:14] <gnarf> abjorn: I was a NeXT user
[22:25:15] <gnarf> so like
[22:25:22] <gnarf> OS X is better than NeXT was
[22:25:22] <abjorn> so you were rich, then?
[22:25:33] <abjorn> NeXT was some NeXT-level shit
[22:25:34] <coldhead> lol
[22:25:40] <abjorn> GET IT?
[22:25:40] <gnarf> nah, just had access to em
[22:25:41] <abjorn> GET IT?
[22:25:53] <gnarf> OpenStep 4.2 was like the hayday
[22:25:54] <abjorn> oh so you worked for a university or large successful company, then?
[22:26:07] <abjorn> coldhead, I see you heard my call
[22:26:17] <abjorn> did my caps get through clearly?
[22:26:20] <coldhead> always, abjsy
[22:26:31] <abjorn> just talkin about
[22:26:33] <abjorn> my work laptop i got
[22:26:38] <abjorn> and how osx makes me mad
[22:26:41] <abjorn> the hardware is brilliant though
[22:26:51] <gnarf> abjorn: chee said the same thing
[22:26:55] <gnarf> eventually put arch on it
[22:27:01] <gnarf> but went back to osx like 2 weeks later
[22:27:18] <abjorn> well yeah he just went from osx to arch that's some system shock there
[22:27:28] <gnarf> he was an arch user before
[22:27:30] <abjorn> "What, I have to do EVERYTHING myself? Well fuck."
[22:27:40] <abjorn> I'd probs just use like
[22:27:43] <abjorn> debian or something
[22:27:55] <gnarf> i haven't ever liked XWMs
[22:28:00] <abjorn> maaaybe arch but probs not
[22:28:19] <abjorn> mac keyboard pisses me off
[22:28:23] <abjorn> not the keyboard itself but the whole
[22:28:25] <gnarf> when I run linux, if it has a gui, i get offended
[22:28:26] <abjorn> command key and shit
[22:28:33] <abjorn> why can't they just do it like everyone else?
[22:28:34] <gnarf> abjorn: command is where it should be
[22:28:49] <abjorn> except it's not a key other keyboards have
[22:29:05] <abjorn> I mean, realistically it's the equivalent of the windows key
[22:29:11] <abjorn> which is a silly key
[22:29:16] <abjorn> but it's in a different place
[22:29:25] <abjorn> and, unlike the windows key, it's actually used for important shit
[22:29:38] <abjorn> but ctrl is still sometimes used to important shit too
[22:29:40] <abjorn> so like
[22:29:42] <abjorn> its confusing
[22:30:14] <Cork> abjorn: the windows key is used for quite a lot of things too
[22:30:25] <Cork> like win+r or win+l and so on
[22:30:50] <abjorn> yeah but not important stuff like
[22:30:52] <abjorn> copy paste
[22:30:54] <gnarf> its a meta key
[22:30:54] <abjorn> or saving files
[22:31:13] <abjorn> i know it's a silly argument, it's not really a big deal
[22:31:22] <abjorn> it's the least of my problems with it, honestly
[22:31:30] <Cork> ya, mac programs has a tendency to mixing cmd and ctrl together in a big mess
[22:31:34] <gnarf> meta = menu command, alt = other important things
[22:31:38] <abjorn> aka every mac program
[22:31:54] <gnarf> like ™ or ö
[22:32:06] <gnarf> :)
[22:32:12] <abjorn> the one thing i do generally love about OSX doesn't technically have anythign to do with the OS, it just only runs on OSX
[22:32:14] <abjorn> iTerm 2
[22:32:15] <abjorn> <3
[22:33:11] <abjorn> they COULD make it for linux, but no one does because the linux folks just go "well whats wrong with terminator" because they've never used iterm 2
[22:33:16] <gnarf> abjorn: http://xahlee.info/kbd/i/kb/sun_keyboard_left.jpg
[22:33:21] <gnarf> proof that command is where it should be
[22:33:33] <abjorn> THERE'S NO CTRL KEY
[22:33:34] <abjorn> WHHYYYY
[22:33:47] <abjorn> well it's just on windows and linux everything uses the ctrl key
[22:33:52] <abjorn> where a lot of shit uses the command key instead
[22:34:00] <abjorn> the placement isn't my problem with it
[22:34:03] <gnarf> abjorn: thats why some things map capslock to control :)
[22:34:15] <gnarf> classic keyboard layout
[22:34:17] <abjorn> nothing ive ever used
[22:34:18] <abjorn> :o
[22:34:27] <gnarf> youngins
[22:34:31] <abjorn> well
[22:34:32] <abjorn> i mean
[22:34:32] <abjorn> yeah
[22:35:02] <gnarf> you grew up with a keyboard so you assume it must be the only sane keyboard layout
[22:35:06] <gnarf> ?
[22:35:12] <abjorn> I mean I realize a lot of these small annoying differences aren't just there to be different.
[22:35:29] <abjorn> well no
[22:35:35] <abjorn> ive seen plenty of older keyboards
[22:35:36] <ryanneufeld> abjorn: you know you can remap those keys right?
[22:35:48] <ryanneufeld> there's like, settings n'shit
[22:36:01] <abjorn> yeah, i tried it, but it didn't really solve the problem where some things use ctrl and some things use cmd, whereas on other systems it would all be ctrl
[22:36:08] <ryanneufeld> yezariael: h
[22:36:11] <ryanneufeld> whoops
[22:36:14] <abjorn> lol
[22:36:20] <ryanneufeld> abjorn: yeah, honestly I had the same problem
[22:36:21] <gnarf> abjorn: name one instance of "using control" for something that should always be command
[22:36:28] <ryanneufeld> and now I'm used to it
[22:36:41] <ryanneufeld> but. every. fucking. time. I use windows
[22:36:45] <ryanneufeld> I open cmd
[22:36:49] <gnarf> i bet you the operation is "meta" and not "control"
[22:36:56] <ryanneufeld> and the first things I run is 'ls'
[22:36:58] <gnarf> thats the diff
[22:37:00] <gnarf> meta-copy
[22:37:07] <gnarf> ctrl sends control characters
[22:37:21] <abjorn> other way around, but yeah gnarf, for instance im used to using ctrl+c and ctrl+v for copy and paste, and ctrl+s for saving, it's command now. If everything followed suit where it's cmd instead of ctrl that'd be fine, but ctrl+c in a terminal is still ctrl+c
[22:37:30] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: have a good night mate, I'm off to bed
[22:37:38] <gnarf> that ctrl-c has meaning
[22:37:42] <gnarf> as a control character
[22:37:48] <abjorn> so do the others
[22:37:54] <gnarf> doesn't the fact that ctrl-c ISN'T copy on windows bother you?
[22:38:03] <gnarf> in a terminal app
[22:38:15] <gnarf> that should be the bother
[22:38:17] <abjorn> no because I don't use terminal on windows because it's a pile of absolute shit
[22:38:24] <gnarf> not that mac still uses the right ctrl
[22:38:47] <abjorn> I just use windows for lazy shit like shit talking operating systems on IRC and playing video games
[22:39:20] <gnarf> abjorn: well then, thank the pc gods that you now actually have a real os, and stop bitchin about things that are right :)
[22:39:29] <shodan45> ok it's late & I'm tired... how do you select element foo that has element bar as its next sibling?
[22:39:40] <gnarf> shodan45: you avoid needing to
[22:39:47] <gnarf> shodan45: :)
[22:39:56] <abjorn> ^
[22:40:04] <gnarf> shodan45: $("bar").prev("foo")
[22:40:10] <gnarf> that would work tho
[22:40:34] <gnarf> you look for bars, then select the previous element of each one, if it matches foo
[22:40:46] <gnarf> if you really want a css selector
[22:41:00] <gnarf> you'll just go mad trying to make it work
[22:41:14] <abjorn> so, my boss was going to get me and my coworker tickets to SXSW then I hear they're moving the interactive portion to Las Vegas so I'm pretty sure that's out the door now
[22:41:55] * shodan45 passed mad a while ago
[22:42:00] <gnarf> abjorn: im pretty sure thats one of the reasons jQuery avoids Las Vegas for confs so far
[22:42:07] <abjorn> it's just like
[22:42:09] <abjorn> why would you do that
[22:42:17] <abjorn> you just make it look like you're going there to party
[22:42:24] <abjorn> which SXSW already has that reputation enough as it is
[22:42:33] <gnarf> its actually a really cool conf city tho
[22:42:37] <gnarf> i've been to a few trade shows there
[22:42:41] <abjorn> but he's offered to send us to Google IO, so I'll probably just do that even if it's farther away lol
[22:42:49] <abjorn> farther away as in I have to wait longer
[22:42:49] <gnarf> and its no different than the party at SF
[22:42:51] <gnarf> :)
[22:43:14] <abjorn> but on the other hand - lots of free swag
[22:51:13] <xSmurf> with the datatables, anyone knows how to scroll to specific node (row) when it is hidden from the DOM?!
[22:51:51] <El_Caballero> Hello guys... I am using jquery and now all my tags <a/> are buttons :(. How can I prevent that?
[22:55:39] <versatiletech> El_Caballero: huh?
[22:55:50] <versatiletech> do you have a link?
[22:56:08] <guideX> easy way to scale and crop based on either width or height? code sample or library somewhere?
[22:56:15] <coldhead> El_Caballero: are you maybe talking about jQuery mobile?
[22:56:35] <El_Caballero> versatiletech: creating the link... a sec.
[22:56:45] <El_Caballero> coldhead: nope. Normal. For Computers
[22:57:39] <El_Caballero> http://190.36.230.36:8081/site/saul3/
[22:58:18] <El_Caballero> all the tags <a> finish with the class ui-button :(
[22:59:35] <El_Caballero> And in the html code... is only  <a class="" href="/chi-siamo.php">Chi siamo</a>
[23:00:18] <versatiletech> El_Caballero: line 88 of java.js
[23:00:22] <versatiletech> that's why
[23:00:44] <coldhead> god bless you, versatiletech
[23:01:36] <versatiletech> :)
[23:01:52] <El_Caballero> versatiletech: I also thought it was... but I commented it and it is the same.
[23:02:10] <coldhead> line 140 maybe?
[23:02:20] <versatiletech> yep
[23:02:21] <versatiletech> th
[23:02:24] <versatiletech> there too
[23:02:29] <El_Caballero> oh... wow
[23:02:51] <El_Caballero> WOW
[23:02:57] <El_Caballero> that was the answer!!
[23:03:13] <coldhead> great job everyone, let's all take five
[23:03:26] <El_Caballero> thanks :)
[23:03:41] <versatiletech> El_Caballero: you owe us a burger
[23:03:59] <El_Caballero> that code is for a form which I done in Java... I will need to do it in another way.
[23:04:08] <El_Caballero> versatiletech: oh..
[23:04:16] <El_Caballero> versatiletech:  :)
[23:04:25] <versatiletech> :)
[23:04:26] <mikeumus> Hey gang, so if I have: li = $(this); how can I select child elements of "li" var like li.('img')
[23:04:35] <coldhead> ?find @ mikeumus
[23:04:35] <bot-t> mikeumus, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[23:04:36] <mikeumus> Hello again versatiletech
[23:04:56] <coldhead> li.find('img')
[23:04:58] <versatiletech> mikeumus: what coldhead said
[23:05:12] <mikeumus> cool thanks guys
[23:05:48] <mikeumus> every day a little more
[23:06:08] <coldhead> just like a woman's love
[23:07:25] <azbyin> why would you use .find?  wouldn't doing $("img", li)  keep is consistent?
[23:07:27] <mikeumus> lol
[23:07:29] <mikeumus> it worked
[23:07:39] <azbyin> although i would prefer to keep the first argument the context
[23:08:25] <mikeumus> thanks again, good night
[23:08:48] <versatiletech> trying to land some new york gigs. Lets see what happens. :)
[23:09:09] <versatiletech> anyone have connections?
[23:11:56] <coldhead> ajpiano, johnkpaul are NYers but your best bet is probably to hang out at some of the many NYC JS events
[23:12:32] <versatiletech> ah yes, I'll keep that in mind thanks
[23:21:49] <dgx> hey all, how do i create this: when i click a link(for example) i load data based on ID from DB and display it in a pop-up?
[23:23:10] <coldhead> you need to use click() to find a click handler, ajax() to retrieve the data and some kind of modal (jQuery UI dialog() perhaps) to show the "pop-up"
[23:23:21] <coldhead> click() to bind* a click handler, soz
[23:26:06] <dgx> right, i see
[23:26:08] <dgx> thanks coldhead
[23:52:21] <guideX> is it possible to get an img inside of a div inside of a div?
[23:53:03] <guideX> something like <div id="mydivid"><div id="myotherdiv"><img src="whatev.jpg" alt="" /></div></div>
[23:56:21] <Cork> guideX: why wouldn't it?
[23:56:32] <Cork> or do you mean get at it with a jquery selector?
[23:56:56] <fRAiLtY-> Any idea why I get a "Stack overflow: 882" on this jQery slider? I'm thinking it's colliding with prototype but I thought I'd set it to noConflict? http://www.printpanoramics.co.uk/
[23:57:40] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: whats the str?
[23:58:06] <El_Caballero> see you guys. Thanks for all :)
[23:58:11] <guideX> well I don't know the syntax
[23:58:11] <raj> is this correct? `if (x === 1) continue`
[23:58:21] <guideX> I only know how to get 1 object at a time
[23:58:21] <raj> I don't want to write the code for that conditional yet
[23:58:26] <raj> but I don't want an error
[23:58:47] <Cork> guideX: your using id's they always match to only one element
[23:58:53] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Sorry what do you mean?
[23:58:57] <Cork> guideX: if you want to select many its classes you want
[23:59:03] <guideX> i'm sorry, the inner one uses a class
[23:59:07] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: str == Steps To Reproduce
[23:59:21] <guideX> so it's div id, div class, img
[23:59:28] <Cork> guideX: and what elements exist multiple times?
[23:59:33] <guideX> the class
[23:59:42] <guideX> the id is unique
[23:59:49] <guideX> but the class is not
[23:59:57] <guideX> and the image has no id/clas
