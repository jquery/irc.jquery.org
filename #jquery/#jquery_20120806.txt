[00:02:49] <coldhead> can you be more specific boyo
[00:14:52] <NeoNmaNDK> Its is pusible to send all ID as Array like <input id="json_unikid1"> and more?
[00:19:36] <heke80> hi
[00:19:47] <BinaryKitten> NeoNmaNDK yes
[00:20:06] <NeoNmaNDK> BinaryKitten: cool, how?
[00:20:14] <BinaryKitten> collection.map(function() { return this.id; }).get();
[00:20:29] <BinaryKitten> that will get you an array of all the ids in collection
[00:20:39] <BinaryKitten> where collection is a jQuery object
[00:21:23] <heke80> I'd like to make special links, that actually are ajax links, which trigget $.get() and set responce to div ...  so far  $('.email_template_remove_link').click(  ............   );   how to get  href  link to get url ... ?
[00:21:57] <BinaryKitten> heke80. hint: href is an ATTRibute.
[00:22:55] <BinaryKitten> heke80 also you might want to pass event into the function   eg .click(function(event) {
[00:23:04] <BinaryKitten> so you can preventDefault on it
[00:23:40] * BinaryKitten departs for work
[00:24:04] <heke80> yes, href is attribute, me not smart enough how to access it intuitively ...
[00:24:29] <BinaryKitten> heke80 the clue is in the capitals of the message
[00:24:30] <heke80> $this.getAttr('href') ? ;
[00:24:55] <BinaryKitten> also another hint is http://api.jquery.com/attr
[00:25:16] <NeoNmaNDK> BinaryKitten: hmm i don't understand, if i got 50 inputs when ID is start like json_ and follow a unik id after, and i want to get all ID's there match json_*
[00:25:20] <heke80> this.attr('href') ?
[00:25:32] <coldhead> another hint is that the character who seems to have the strongest alibi is also usually the one who dunnit
[00:25:37] <coldhead> at least in agatha christie
[00:26:09] <BinaryKitten> NeoNmaNDK  oh
[00:26:25] <BinaryKitten> $('[id^=json_]')
[00:26:34] <BinaryKitten> will get you all those objects
[00:26:48] <BinaryKitten> alternatively and better way is to give them all a class
[00:27:18] <BinaryKitten> but
[00:27:39] <BinaryKitten> NeoNmaNDK, once you have that collection .. to get the array of ids
[00:27:54] <BinaryKitten> var idArray = collection.map(function() { return this.id; }).get();
[00:28:12] <BinaryKitten> anyway. must go catch a bus
[00:28:16] <NeoNmaNDK> if but i need the IDs becures i want to take the value and send, its make it easyer to handle a lot of inputs whitout to changes my JS code, :)
[00:28:17] <heke80> !bin
[00:32:12] <heke80> this should work , right ? http://pastebin.com/VRNtzZ4y  ?
[00:34:44] <coldhead> depends on the href
[00:34:57] <coldhead> plus i always say $(this).attr() instead of this.attr()
[00:35:07] <coldhead> because i wouldn't expect this to be a jQuery object
[00:35:22] <coldhead> although it very likely is and i am just a big stupid pants
[00:45:40] <jkarsrud> coldhead: you're not stupid pants!
[00:46:11] <jkarsrud> I tend to do that too, though I often go var self = $(this); or var $this = $(this) :)
[00:58:48] <coldhead> GREAT MEN MADE SACRFICIES
[00:59:19] <heke80> somehow doesn't work , http://pastebin.com/fLunxSat
[01:00:14] <seutje> heke80: don't use alert(), it halts execution
[01:00:30] <seutje> and try specifying a data type
[01:00:33] <heke80> yes, its for debuginh only ...
[01:00:47] <seutje> use console.log or something that doesn't break stuff
[01:01:11] <seutje> http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[01:01:54] <Lindrian> hey
[01:02:04] <Lindrian> im sending a ajax request using jquery and sometimes it times out
[01:02:13] <Lindrian> how can i make it re-send the request if that happens?
[01:03:09] <seutje> Lindrian: textStatus in the complete handler will say "timeout" afaik
[01:03:49] <seutje> Lindrian: same for error handler
[01:04:48] <ravenzz> it will
[01:05:13] <Lindrian> ??
[01:07:23] <seutje> sigh, I hate the double questionmarks thing
[01:07:26] <seutje> $.ajax({ error: function (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) { if (textStatus == 'timeout') { /* retry */ } } });
[01:07:54] <gvo> Lindrian: http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1500-Catching-Timeout-Errors-With-jQuery-Powered-AJAX.htm
[01:08:42] <seutje> OHSNAP, there's a dedicated timeout handler now?
[01:09:04] <seutje> no, wait, I'm retarded, it's an int, not a func
[01:25:12] <Lindrian> success: function(data, textStatus, xhr) { handleRequest(data, textStatus, xhr); }
[01:25:14] <Lindrian> is this valid?
[01:26:59] <heke80> i have  <form accept-charset="utf-8" method="post" id="EmailTemplateLinkTemplatelinksForm" action="/asdasd/53a2e645"> ....... </FORM>   and $('#EmailTemplateLinkTemplatelinksForm').submit (  function(){} ) should get it right ?
[01:27:12] <heke80> doesn't happen so ...
[01:29:12] <jkarsrud> Lindrian: why don't you just pass handleRequest to success directly?
[01:29:18] <jkarsrud> success: handleRequest
[01:30:02] <Lindrian> jkarsrud: i dont understand, what do you mean?
[01:30:27] <jkarsrud> instead of making an anonymous callback function, just pass handleRequest instead
[01:30:35] <jkarsrud> but yes, what you said is valid
[01:30:38] <Lindrian> how do i type that?
[01:30:49] <Lindrian> just like success: handleRequest?
[01:30:50] <jkarsrud> just like I said; success: handleRequest
[01:30:52] <Lindrian> no () or anything?
[01:30:55] <jkarsrud> nopes
[01:31:24] <jkarsrud> $.ajax({url: "someUrl", success: handleRequest, error: handleError}) for instance
[01:31:31] <Lindrian> nice
[01:33:41] <Lindrian> bah
[01:33:48] <Lindrian> i hate when stuff doesnt work :(
[01:34:07] <jkarsrud> what doesn't work?
[01:34:22] <Lindrian> my ajax stuff
[01:34:39] <Lindrian> I'll try to explain what I want to do, then ill paste some code
[01:34:41] <seutje> heke80: what do u mean "get it"?
[01:34:54] <seutje> heke80: are you trying to submit the form or trying to capture the submit event?
[01:35:24] <heke80> both , first capture then  $.post() it ...
[01:35:28] <Lindrian> I have a couple input boxes/textarea that once typed in, shall send an ajax request. My goal is to only send 1 request and receive the most recently one sent. So if I type, send a request, then type again, I want the result of the most recent request and cancel the first.
[01:35:46] <Lindrian> If there's a timeout I want to inform the user of this and then re-send the request to try again
[01:36:01] <Lindrian> Does that all make sense jkarsrud ?
[01:36:09] <jkarsrud> tl;dr :P
[01:36:21] <Lindrian> ...
[01:36:28] <Lindrian> That's not very nice.
[01:36:29] <seutje> $('#form-id').once('submit', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); this.submit(); }); ?
[01:36:31] <jkarsrud> :D
[01:36:32] <seutje> heke80: ^
[01:36:53] <jkarsrud> seutje: you mean one?
[01:37:19] <heke80> I want to the server reply into special #div
[01:37:36] <jkarsrud> Lindrian: have you looked at throttling?
[01:37:45] <Lindrian> jkarsrud: http://pastebin.com/8pyVX5ZZ
[01:37:54] <seutje> jkarsrud: right, my bad
[01:37:57] <Lindrian> The code might look like shit, but I've tried my best
[01:38:20] <jkarsrud> seutje: isn't once some drupal stuff or something?
[01:38:22] <Lindrian> There's a bunch of hide/show going on, but thats all cosmetics.
[01:38:39] <NodeX> Lindrian : the recipie is to set a timer to send the request, when a keypress is sent the timer is stopped and started again
[01:38:41] <seutje> jkarsrud: possible, think it used to be a plugin before it went into core jQuery
[01:39:02] <Lindrian> NodeX: I thought I was doing that. Look at my code.
[01:40:23] <NodeX> so what;s the problem then?
[01:40:45] <Lindrian> NodeX: i want it to resend the request after it fails (timeout)
[01:40:47] <Lindrian> it's not doing that
[01:41:09] <Lindrian> also, look at the commented code at the start of updateRegex()
[01:41:17] <Lindrian> had to comment that code out in order to make it work...
[01:45:41] <heke80> here is what i have
[01:45:42] <heke80> http://pastebin.com/fPyncBar
[01:46:30] <Lindrian> Wat?
[01:46:31] <b-ot> when we make decision that affect another live how much more complicated thing become
[01:46:38] <Lindrian> NodeX: can you help me?
[01:47:15] <heke80> some how  form posting does no work...
[01:48:19] <squeakytoy> I have a very strange problem. When i do jquery.remove() on an object, IE8 is giving me the "security warning" popup. Anyone ever heard about this before?
[01:51:39] <alemini> hey guys, i'm looking for a way to auto reorganize divs using animation. for example i've got 2 blocks, and when i click on the bottom one, i want it to replace the top one using animation. using just animate won'
[01:51:55] <alemini> won't be enough because it's much more than 2 divs
[02:02:13] <Lindrian> my only problem right now is that it wont re-send the god damn request!!!
[02:15:17] <boulet101010_> $('body').append('<button>lol</button>',{click:function(){alert("lol")}}); is something like this possible to declare a click event?
[02:20:08] <NodeX> I think appendTo() returns the object
[02:20:40] <boulet101010_> yes i just wanted to ask about the { click : ... }
[02:20:47] <boulet101010_> but noprob i just bind it
[02:21:00] <NodeX> $().append(foo).click(....);
[02:21:21] <mazzachre> I am using drag/drop in some UI I am making, and I have a problem with the "grid" part... I have set the grid vertical to 18px as is the grid size of where it should go, and it have the right movement, but it does not align to the top of the divs I can put it into, it is some 6px or so too high up... What can I do about that?
[02:21:40] <NodeX> but you eill probably need to do it like this..
[02:22:07] <NodeX> $().append($('<button>lol</button>')).click(....);
[02:25:36] <seutje> u don't need to wrap that
[02:26:12] <seutje> $().append('<button>lol</button>') works fine
[02:26:16] <seutje> afaik
[02:31:50] <boulet101010_> how do i know if it needs to be wrapped?
[02:32:16] <boulet101010_> (when i write jquery i wrap almost everything)
[02:32:39] <rabbi1> i am adding a class for set of fields in load: function of $tabs ... but not working, any suggestion?
[02:33:12] <NodeX> I think you do need to wrap it because it's an object that needs to be bound
[02:33:49] <seutje> .append returns the object you are appending to
[02:33:49] <b-ot> seutje, no YOU ARE appending to
[02:34:07] <seutje> b-ot: don't make do things I'll regret!
[02:34:31] <tocka> morning guys
[02:34:34] <tocka> wanted to ask a question
[02:34:35] <NodeX> he doersnt want the object he is appending to
[02:34:43] <seutje> NodeX: if u wanna bind to the element you are appending, use $('<button>foo</button>').appendTo(something).bind(...)
[02:34:46] <NodeX> he wants the object that's being appended and to bind a click to it
[02:34:47] <ProLoser|Mac> how do i bind to multi key presses?
[02:34:48] <tocka> I have a drop down menu for responsive design
[02:34:50] <boulet101010_> ok so $( just mean that inside that there is an object
[02:35:05] <NodeX> seutje : i said that 30 minutes ago
[02:35:05] <rabbi1> NodeX: for me ?
[02:35:14] <tocka> but the thing is when i collapse it to the height when it changes
[02:35:21] <NodeX> [10:20:08] <NodeX> I think appendTo() returns the object
[02:35:21] <NodeX> [10:20:40] <boulet101010_> yes i just wanted to ask about the { click : ... }
[02:35:34] <tocka> it expands automatically
[02:35:36] <tocka> http://pastebin.com/85m0iLKQ
[02:35:38] <seutje> sorry, I just don't want ppl to write shit like this: <NodeX> $().append($('<button>lol</button>')).click(....);
[02:35:54] <rabbi1> load: function(e, ui) { $('.checkValid').addClass('inValid'); },
[02:36:24] <NodeX> w/e dude
[02:36:34] <boulet101010_>  #jquery.onmisunderstanding(Haha);
[02:37:00] <mazzachre> Can I somehow move a dragable object when I start the drag? The objects I want to drag does not vertically align with the dropable placement...
[02:37:03] <seutje> $($($($($($($($($($('<lol/>')))))))));
[02:37:27] <NodeX> not sure how you can comment on people writing code when you advocate drupal but each to thier own
[02:37:56] <seutje> I don't recall advocating it
[02:38:24] <mazzachre> $(ircchannel).appendTo('<flamewar/>');
[02:38:30] <NodeX> lol, you just goto all those drupal events for fun?
[02:38:45] <mattfield> #ircfacepalm
[02:39:11] <seutje> I don't think I need to justify why I go to social events, especially not in a completely unrelated IRC channel
[02:39:41] <NodeX> you just said you dont advocate it
[02:39:54] <NodeX> yet you work for a drupal company, and attend events and support it
[02:39:59] <NodeX> cool story
[02:40:06] <seutje> I don't go there to advocate it, that would be like preaching to the choir
[02:40:19] <NodeX> simple fact, dont come at me about so called "shit code" when you work on that crap
[02:40:25] <seutje> wtf?
[02:40:35] <NodeX> [10:35:38] <seutje> sorry, I just don't want ppl to write shit like this: <NodeX> $().append($('<button>lol</button>')).click(....);
[02:40:39] <NodeX> that's "wtf"
[02:41:14] <mattfield> guys, seriously...
[02:41:40] <seutje> how the ass does ignore work in limechat? wtb docs on this shit :(
[02:41:48] <NodeX> ./ignore NodeX
[02:41:52] <NodeX> without the dot
[02:42:27] <seutje> thanks :)
[02:42:33] <NodeX> die
[02:42:47] <NodeX> * Added seutje!*@* to ignore list ... another one bites the dust
[02:44:21] <rabbi1> load: function(e, ui) { $('.checkValid').addClass('inValid'); } this isn't working any suggestion ? this is under UI Tab
[02:46:05] <Lindrian> This is so weird... I set my xhr-variable to NULL and then check if it's null, and it's not
[02:46:08] <Lindrian> How is that even possible?
[03:04:10] <zayka> hi
[03:04:16] <zayka> what is the maximum number of php class name?
[03:04:18] <zayka> maximum length *
[03:04:30] <zayka> is it ok to generate class name from serialized array?
[03:05:26] <masak> will JS5 and JS5/strict affect jQuery in any way as it gains market share?
[03:05:53] <masak> er, ES5 and ES5/strict, I mean.
[03:18:05] <alaing> mornig
[03:18:28] <masak> o/
[03:19:45] <alaing> anyone here use uploadify?
[03:20:16] <alaing> or know of another multi file upload plugin for IE7
[03:21:41] <DarsVaeda> hi does anybody know a way or plugin that will allow to scroll through scrollable elements just by hovering on top or bottom?
[03:22:08] <NodeX> I use uploadify in a coupld of projects
[03:22:15] <jkarsrud> alaing: looked at plupload?
[03:22:31] <alaing> jkarsrud: no thanks i'll have a look at thta
[03:22:54] <alaing> NodeX: do you know of a why to find the request value that was sent to the server?
[03:23:15] <alaing> i know it uses flash so I cannot use firebug to monitor it
[03:23:49] <alaing> I tried posting a message on uploadify forum but it seems plagues with adverts and spam
[03:23:54] <NodeX> echo it on the server and use onSuccess : to write the response
[03:24:48] <alaing> This is the post I put up on the forum
[03:24:59] <alaing> NodeX I'm not using php
[03:25:20] <NodeX> whatever you're using, echo it out
[03:25:27] <alaing> My server is complainging that a bad request was made
[03:26:49] <alaing> NodeX I understand but I'm trying to figure out how to pick out the request
[03:27:27] <alaing> if I can find away to add it to formData but I dont think I would even get that far
[03:27:39] <NodeX> onSUccess
[03:28:04] <NodeX> sorry.
[03:28:12] <NodeX> onUploadSuccess : function(file,data,response) { .. console.log(data); } ...
[03:28:21] <NodeX> data is what the server responded with
[03:30:47] <alaing> Ok, but I managed to get the server response from the SWF Debug window
[03:31:07] <alaing> Sorry I forgot to post the url to the forum post
[03:31:17] <alaing> http://www.uploadify.com/forum/#/discussion/8640/trying-to-access-the-request-values-sent-to-the-sever-
[03:35:38] <alaing> Actually I might try plupload....I remember during my research I came across it and liked the look and feel but I couldn't remember what it was called.
[03:35:43] <alaing> Thanks jkarsrud
[03:35:49] <jkarsrud> worked? :)
[03:36:09] <alaing> Not yet, I was just playing about with the examples
[03:37:59] <alaing> I like a the look and feel, documentation looks good and the forums not plagues with spam
[03:38:18] <alaing> what more could I ask for..
[03:42:39] <lilalinuxHamburg> I have some trouble with an ajax POST: http://pastebin.com/KYp1uQEM

[03:44:06] <lilalinuxHamburg> thx
[03:44:22] <granden> If I want to check if all fields is filled in a form, and if do a normal form submit. Else highlight the not entered one in red. How would I do that?

[03:48:04] <lilalinuxHamburg> firebug
[03:48:09] <lilalinuxHamburg> and FF
[03:48:24] <lilalinuxHamburg> I tried w/ and w/o processData

[03:49:13] <b-ot> lilalinuxHamburg, memorised “D&?”.
[03:49:33] <lilalinuxHamburg> thought it was a 1-liner :-)
[03:49:34] <alaing> lol @ b-ot
[03:49:55] <alaing> our yes I can see the postData
[03:50:24] <alaing> have you tried just returning postData?
[03:50:27] <lilalinuxHamburg> it seems to do a (data).toString
[03:50:36] <alaing> perhaps its not valid json?
[03:50:39] <lilalinuxHamburg> where should I return it?
[03:51:03] <granden> johnkpaul: Thanks, will look at that
[03:51:10] <lilalinuxHamburg> When I console.log() it, then I can navigate through the json
[03:51:34] <Lindrian> Hello. I need help with my ajax request. I am trying to make it re-send the request automatically if an error occurs, but I can't seem to get it to work : http://pastebin.com/h7DxjAJz
[03:51:40] <Lindrian> Can someone please help me?
[03:52:15] <mattfield> lilalinuxHamburg: I think you need to decode the JSON
[03:52:16] <alaing> How odd
[03:52:24] <alaing> what jquery are you using lilalinuxHamburg
[03:52:32] <lilalinuxHamburg> I _think_ 1.5
[03:52:37] <lilalinuxHamburg> it's shipped with jira 4.4
[03:52:48] <lilalinuxHamburg> maattfield: how?
[03:52:55] <alaing> not heard of jira before
[03:53:03] <lilalinuxHamburg> atlassian bugtracking tool
[03:53:41] <alaing> lilalinuxHamburg: jQuery.parseJSON( json )?
[03:54:34] <mattfield> lilalinuxHamburg: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[03:54:38] <Lindrian> anyone?
[03:54:48] <lilalinuxHamburg> thx, but that takes a string
[03:55:47] <lilalinuxHamburg> This is my json: http://pastebin.com/6aG7aaH4
[03:56:47] <fgro> hi. i've bound a callback for the "click" event to a link with bind()/on() ... how can I determine if a callback for this event has already been added? What i need is conditional callback adding...
[03:57:59] <kryl> hi, how can I use selector on id="nb-1" id="nb-2", etc...
[03:58:09] <mattfield> lilalinuxHamburg: are you sure that's producing valid json?
[03:58:25] <mattfield> lilalinuxHamburg: it's looks fine to me, but worth checking
[03:58:36] <lilalinuxHamburg> mattfield: I just tried with hardcoded data : {'FOO':'BAR'},
[03:58:38] <lilalinuxHamburg> same problem
[03:59:29] <mattfield> lilalinuxHamburg: have you tried doing anything with the response? Just console logging it?
[03:59:54] <ravenzz> lilalinuxHamburg you should use double quotes
[03:59:58] <mattfield> lilalinuxHamburg: because it's not surprising that you're getting [object Object] in the plain response, considering that's exactly what json is
[04:00:02] <lilalinuxHamburg> ravenzz: why?
[04:00:36] <lilalinuxHamburg> mattfield: that's not the response, it's the request, and it contains [object Object] literally
[04:00:51] <ravenzz> because that's the valid way
[04:01:04] <lilalinuxHamburg> k
[04:01:11] <mattfield> lilalinuxHamburg: again, not surprising. you're sending json.
[04:01:56] <lilalinuxHamburg> mattfield: so it takes what it's given and does a (data).toString?
[04:03:04] <mattfield> yeah lilalinuxHamburg. the 'data' key for $.ajax gets converted to a query string
[04:03:36] <lilalinuxHamburg> s/converted/garbled/ :-)
[04:03:50] <lilalinuxHamburg> the docs say it's valid to pass json
[04:03:53] <mattfield> lilalinuxHamburg: ah, but you've got processData set to false, so it won't be converted to a string  :P
[04:04:03] <lilalinuxHamburg> that was just an attempt
[04:04:07] <lilalinuxHamburg> it had no effect
[04:04:20] <mattfield> lilalinuxHamburg: at the moment, the request isn't being send as 'application/json'
[04:04:42] <mattfield> lilalinuxHamburg: it's being sent as 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
[04:04:59] <lilalinuxHamburg> how would I manually convert json to a valid json string?
[04:05:31] <mattfield> JSON.stringify https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify
[04:06:05] <lilalinuxHamburg> thx
[04:07:08] <lilalinuxHamburg> how do I access the JSON object?
[04:07:55] <mattfield> it's a global
[04:09:38] <lilalinuxHamburg> ok, that looks better
[04:10:08] <mattfield> sounds encouraging!
[04:10:22] <lilalinuxHamburg> now let's see how JAX-RS consumes this
[04:10:32] <Lindrian> Nobody...? Really?
[04:11:04] <lilalinuxHamburg> Lindrian: maybe with a timeout?
[04:11:16] <Lindrian> Look at my code, I have tried...
[04:12:28] <mattfield> Lindrian: are there specific conditions for it failing?
[04:12:41] <Lindrian> just anything that gets thrown into the error-area
[04:12:49] <Lindrian> like a timeout or execution error at the server or something
[04:13:03] <Lindrian> most commonly it will be the timeout triggering it
[04:19:40] <alaing> jkarsrud: do you know if you can post data as part of the upload
[04:19:53] <alaing> jkarsrud: for plupload?
[04:19:55] <mattfield> Lindrian: what's the reason for having a timeout on the request?
[04:20:12] <mattfield> Lindrian: are you making multiple requests at once?
[04:20:17] <jkarsrud> alaing: no, don't think so
[04:20:27] <alaing> bugger
[04:20:33] <Lindrian> mattfield: I only want to have 1 active request
[04:20:44] <jkarsrud> I don't remember their API's, but I kinda doubt it.. the data would have to be a separate request anyway
[04:20:44] <Lindrian> but I send a request each time the user types into an input box (with a small delay)
[04:21:01] <alaing> jkarsrud: I need to pass session id, page id, app id to my server (as part of security_
[04:21:03] <mattfield> yeah, I can see the 100ms grace period
[04:21:12] <Lindrian> mattfield: The request _can_ timeout, and if it does, I just want to send a new one and inform the user of this
[04:22:35] <jkarsrud> alaing: seems you can actually; using multipart_params; Object name/value collection with arguments to get posted together with the multipart file.
[04:22:43] <blackspotwiggins> jkarsrud, wat? formdata allows both upload and regular data
[04:22:48] <jkarsrud> yeah
[04:23:00] <jkarsrud> I remembered, which was why I started looking at the docs :)
[04:23:03] <jkarsrud> and there it was
[04:23:08] <blackspotwiggins> formdata is all around awesome
[04:23:14] <alaing> jkarsrud: lol thanks a million....
[04:23:17] <jkarsrud> alaing: http://www.plupload.com/documentation.php
[04:23:56] <granden> johnkpaul: Hmm, i did try that, but I think I'm doing something wrong. because it sends in the form anyway. now I did, var validator $('#myform').validate();
[04:24:01] <granden> and included that file
[04:24:38] <alaing> jkarsrud: I was going threw all the various settings but I must of missed that on.
[04:26:26] <alaing> Unfortuantely unlike PHP I do not have access to $_POST to grab the file and proccess, any idea how i could grab the file that was being processesd and so  Icould add it as part of the multipart_params
[04:27:35] <rabbi1> if "tab = div#TabName.TabClassName" how can i get "div#TabName.TabClassName .FieldsClassName" ?  is it $('tab .FieldsClassName"); to target the specific elements of a specific tab ?
[04:28:03] <jkarsrud> alaing: what, what are you using to handle the upload then?
[04:28:29] <mattfield> rabbi1: $(tab + ' .FieldsClassName');
[04:28:44] <rabbi1> mattfield: i have tried that
[04:28:55] <alaing> jkarsrud: ORACLE Application Express
[04:29:07] <mattfield> rabbi1: you're targeting a tab based on it's id AND class name?
[04:29:10] <rabbi1> but the console of that give me null in the firebug
[04:29:37] <rabbi1> mattfield: yeah, an element classname of a particular tab
[04:29:42] <mattfield> Lindrian: I'll confess to being stumped. Can't see what's happening.
[04:29:54] <Lindrian> mattfield: :(
[04:29:54] <jkarsrud> alaing: no idea, sorry
[04:29:55] <alaing> basically I just need a way to post data for a variable called x01 :"FILE CONTENTs " and i shoudl be abel to pick it up and process it
[04:30:05] <mattfield> Lindrian: everything looks ok to me
[04:30:09] <Lindrian> mattfield: i think it's my if (xhr!=null) thing thats messing stuff up
[04:30:12] <Lindrian> but I don't know why...
[04:30:19] <alaing> too either load into oracle DB or to output to filesystem,
[04:30:24] <Lindrian> I set xhr  = null; before i do the timer to redo the request
[04:30:32] <alaing> which i can do
[04:30:36] <Lindrian> but when i alert(xhr); I get [object Object] and not null
[04:31:24] <jkarsrud> alaing: but you could look at this? http://www.plupload.com/example_custom.php
[04:31:58] <jkarsrud> and the uploader API? http://www.plupload.com/plupload/docs/api/index.html#class_plupload.Uploader.html
[04:32:03] <mattfield> rabbi1: in that case you're missing a space: var tab = $('div#TabName .TabClassName'), then $(tab + ' .FieldsClassName');
[04:32:21] <mattfield> Lindrian: it sounds like you're always getting a response
[04:32:39] <Lindrian> but im not..
[04:32:56] <Lindrian> and if i view the response its cancelled
[04:32:59] <Lindrian> due to the timeout
[04:34:23] <rabbi1> var test = $(tab+ ' .FieldClassName');console.log("TESTING:", test);   ---- This give me a Syntax Error in the console :(
[04:34:58] <rabbi1> unrecognized expression [object object]
[04:36:15] <mattfield> try console.log("testing: " + test);
[04:36:20] <mattfield> or just console.log(test);
[04:36:52] <mattfield> Lindrian: you might just have to go through each step and debug as you go, with plenty of debugger; and console logs
[04:38:16] <Lindrian> mattfield: okay then...
[04:38:22] <Lindrian> But why is the xhr variable not null?
[04:38:24] <Lindrian> I set it to null..
[04:39:36] <mattfield> null is a bit dodgy. if you want it to begin as empty, then just don't assign anything to it. just declare it as var xhr;
[04:41:24] <mattfield> or rather than checking to see whether it's == null, just check whether it's falsey, so if (!json)
[04:41:37] <mattfield> or if (!xhr)
[04:41:40] <blackspotwiggins> Lindrian, what are you trying to achieve?
[04:43:16] <Lindrian> blackspotwiggins: i want to resend the request on error
[04:43:18] <Lindrian> which it doesnt do
[04:43:27] <Lindrian> most likely since xhr != null for some reason
[04:44:07] <mattfield> i'd also use !== if you're comparing to null
[04:44:19] <rabbi1> mattfield: all options, same error
[04:44:20] <blackspotwiggins> why would you check for null then?
[04:44:30] <mattfield> either that, or check if it's truthy/falsey
[04:44:43] <mattfield> rabbi1: can you put a fiddle together please?
[04:51:23] <Parhs> hello dudes..
[04:51:28] <mattfield> rabbi1: http://jsfiddle.net/mattfieldy/WMd78/
[04:51:32] <Lindrian> blackspotwiggins: idea is to check if there's an ajax request already ongoing, if so, we just wait.
[04:51:46] <Parhs> is there anything ready made like this http://parhs.no-ip.org/
[04:52:04] <Parhs> for images
[04:53:03] <johnkpaul> granden: did you read the documentation?
[04:53:04] <blackspotwiggins> Lindrian, var xhr = $.ajax(); if(xhr) not working?
[04:53:43] <Lindrian> nope
[04:53:45] <Lindrian> check my code
[04:53:54] <Lindrian> I have tried just if(xhr)
[04:54:09] <blackspotwiggins> i didnt catch the fiddle, sry
[04:54:52] <johnkpaul> Lindrian: http://gnarf.net/2011/06/21/jquery-ajaxqueue/ perhaps that's what you're looking for
[04:54:53] <johnkpaul> I didn'
[04:55:02] <johnkpaul> I didn't scroll far back up though, so apologies if that's not related
[04:55:33] <Lindrian> but I dont want a queue
[04:55:38] <Lindrian> in reality I just want 1 request
[04:55:48] <Lindrian> if there's a new request, cancel/ignore the last and send a new one
[04:56:08] <johnkpaul> "just makes sure that only one ajax call can be running at a time."
[04:56:18] <blackspotwiggins> hmm, ive been using if(xhr) in my code
[04:56:29] <johnkpaul> blackspotwiggins: if ($.ajax()) will always be true
[04:56:32] <blackspotwiggins> but then again
[04:57:02] <johnkpaul> Lindrian: oh, you want to only have one ajax call goig at all, ever?
[04:57:09] <blackspotwiggins> Lindrian, try xhr.isResolved()
[04:57:10] <Lindrian> yes, pretty much
[04:57:10] <johnkpaul> even if they're to different urls?
[04:57:22] <Lindrian> no, just in this script
[04:57:36] <Lindrian> i just want this script to have 1 active request
[04:58:02] <johnkpaul> what do you mean by "this script"
[04:58:15] <Lindrian> i dont want this to be a global thing
[04:58:41] <johnkpaul> does "this script" only have one single ajax call, that gets made multiple times?
[04:58:57] <Lindrian> multiple times
[04:59:01] <Lindrian> its on keyup
[04:59:11] <Lindrian> but only the last request sent is the relevant one
[04:59:57] <blackspotwiggins> Lindrian, you could also use throttle() on the keyup
[05:00:06] <Lindrian> i have a timer on keyup
[05:00:11] <Lindrian> on keydown i reset it
[05:00:18] <Lindrian> so that part is kind of controlled and working fine
[05:00:56] <johnkpaul> Lindrian: do you only want this ajax call to happen when they've finished typing, or every keystroke?
[05:01:18] <johnkpaul> it seems like this would be easily resolved by throttling the ajax call, but I don't really understand it all
[05:01:34] <Lindrian> I want to send a request each time the user types something
[05:02:02] <Lindrian> but lets say he typed some stuff in, the request was sent and then he started typing again
[05:02:22] <Lindrian> then I want the old request to be ignored/cancelled and wait for the new one, as its the relevant one.
[05:02:29] <blackspotwiggins> Lindrian, did you try isResolved()
[05:02:32] <Lindrian> the old one holds no important data
[05:02:37] <blackspotwiggins> you can also check readyState
[05:02:43] <Lindrian> blackspotwiggins: instead of != null?
[05:02:53] <some_dude> hey
[05:03:02] <blackspotwiggins> yes
[05:03:06] <Lindrian> let me try
[05:03:13] <johnkpaul> Lindrian: if you want to check if an ajax call is still pending compltetion, use .state() == 'pending'
[05:05:16] <Lindrian> ill try it soon
[05:05:17] <Lindrian> at work
[05:05:25] <blackspotwiggins> funny
[05:05:57] <blackspotwiggins> you've spent last 2+ hours on this
[05:06:04] <blackspotwiggins> and now you dont have time :D
[05:13:27] <Lindrian> blackspotwiggins: i had 2 hours of nothing to do
[05:13:30] <Lindrian> now i have stuff to do :/
[05:13:37] <Lindrian> cant really control it
[05:13:47] <Woet> I'm using the CSS3 "resize" option to make something vertically resizable, is it possible to have a custom handle?
[05:24:53] <sebah> hello! does anyone know a jQuery carousel ( slider ) which can work on multiple levels and multiple instances on the same stage? so there are the big carousels ( let's 5 of them ) and each one of them have inside another carousel
[05:27:21] <seutje> cycleception
[05:27:46] <seutje> never tried it, but I don't see any reason why cycle wouldn't be able to handle that
[05:28:01] <some_dude> Im trying to bind the click event of a tab. $(a[name=tab1]).click (function(){....   what am I doing wrong? note: $(a[name=mytab]).click() for triggering the event works fine.
[05:28:11] <seutje> but I don't think there's anything out there specifically designed for embedding carousels in carousels
[05:29:00] <seutje> some_dude: some other handler is asploding the flow?
[05:29:52] <some_dude> socialhapy, what do you mean? ma
[05:30:00] <some_dude> seutje, what you mean?
[05:30:57] <sebah> seutje: if you were talking to me, do you have a link :) ?
[05:34:14] <seutje> some_dude: http://jsfiddle.net/2fwQR/
[05:35:19] <rabbi1> mattfield: thx, but what we are passing there is string, but i have the content of var as an array object.
[05:35:28] <some_dude> seutje, I don't have e.stopImmediatePropagation();  anywhere
[05:36:02] <seutje> it was just an example of something that could break the flow and cause other handlers to not be executed, I'm sure there's more things that cause it
[05:37:12] <mattfield> rabbi1: what type are each of the indexes in the array?
[05:37:49] <rabbi1> mattfield: array
[05:38:26] <mattfield> rabbi1: no, what type are each of the indexes? strings?
[05:38:40] <rabbi1> o, index ?
[05:38:50] <rabbi1> nope, integers
[05:39:15] <mattfield> no, what are each of the items in your array stored as??
[05:39:27] <rabbi1> mattfield: that is strings
[05:39:37] <mattfield> then you're ok using that method
[05:40:01] <mattfield> just pass in the index of the array to use, so $(arr[0] + ' .classname');
[05:40:24] <some_dude> seutje, np I got it, should've handled it with the 'select' event of the JUI tabs plugin.
[05:40:40] <seutje> JUI? o.O
[05:40:47] <some_dude> jquery ui
[05:40:50] <mattfield> or if you're passing in a whole reference to a DOM object (i.e. wrapped in jQuery already), then use something like $(element).next('.classname').
[05:41:05] <seutje> oh lol sry
[05:41:29] <seutje> JUI is some ancient java gui builder library :P
[05:41:41] <mattfield> as you can't concatenate something like $(tab + ' .classname') if var tab = $(element);
[05:41:56] <seutje> so I guess jquery ui asplodes the click and fires a select... interesting`
[05:41:57] <some_dude> seutje, so you're an ancient java dev? :)
[05:42:07] <seutje> no, I'm quick on the googles
[05:43:57] <rabbi1> I am actually trying to validate tabs, so i am running a while loop (to check for previous tab) I am passing the previous tab to a function where the validation is done from a select: event of UI Tab, so i am passing a 'var tab' that will have the previous tab like: 'div#TabName.TabClassName' I am passing this to a function. Under this function i am trying to check for each element with a for loop have a class name '.required'. so finally i am checking like:
[05:46:33] <boulet101010_> o.find(".s").each(function() {$(this).empty();}); >> can i write this without the anonym function?
[05:46:57] <shoky> boulet101010: o.find(".s").empty()
[05:47:27] <boulet101010_> shame on me, so when to use each ?!
[05:47:47] <shoky> when it's not done for you
[05:48:27] <dbalani> each is the collection iterator
[05:48:33] <dbalani> .each()
[05:48:41] <boulet101010_> ok, so it's more like a "foreach" ?
[05:48:46] <dbalani> yeap
[05:48:54] <boulet101010_> ok thanks so
[05:48:58] <dbalani> np
[05:49:03] <shoky> boulet101010: using .each is fine, but the docs for .empty() say: Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM.
[05:49:09] <shoky> "of the set of matched elements"
[05:49:15] <shoky> so it loops the set for you.
[05:49:19] <shoky> like many jquery methods
[05:50:18] <dbalani> shoky is right
[05:50:20] * boulet101010_ needs to learn jquery
[05:53:08] <Lindrian> blackspotwiggins: Did not work.
[05:53:49] <Lindrian> blackspotwiggins: if (!xhr.isResolved()) { did not work.
[05:53:49] <shoky> slacker
[05:57:40] <blackspotwiggins> Lindrian, care to elaborate?
[05:57:47] <blackspotwiggins> it returns false when it's done for me
[05:58:23] <Lindrian> wat
[05:58:23] <b-ot> 50% users use IE and out of this 50% users 80% uses IE6 and want design in HTML5 and w3school valid.
[05:58:52] <Lindrian> thats wrong blackspotwiggins
[05:58:59] <dbalani> b-ot: true
[05:59:03] <Lindrian> it should return TRUE when it is finished, false if its not.
[06:04:16] <shoky> why not just put an incrementing request id on each request and only handle the last one in your callback
[06:05:35] <Flo0815> hey guys, i have a problem. I'm preloading ~ 120 images via ajax (jQuery). The requests are pulled, the images are saved in an object but the browser (FF) never stops the requests, it's always loading and loading and loading... I read something about the "Throbber of doom" but i really don't know how to solve this. Can someone help me please? Heres the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/e2ckn/
[06:07:28] <shoky> Flo0815: your use of that 'i' index inside the loop is very bad
[06:07:55] <Flo0815> why?
[06:08:00] <shoky> Flo0815: by the time your load callback is called for some image, the loop would have already finished looping, 'i' would have the last value
[06:08:12] <Flo0815> hmmmm
[06:08:20] <shoky> (if they're not already preloaded)
[06:08:44] <Flo0815> so how do i solve this?
[06:08:55] <shoky> best with $.each
[06:09:06] <Flo0815> instead of the for-loop
[06:09:06] <Flo0815> ?
[06:09:09] <shoky> which puts your loop block inside a function scope
[06:09:15] <shoky> giving local scope to the variables (such as i)
[06:09:20] <shoky> yes
[06:09:29] <Flo0815> ok i'll try that
[06:09:36] <Flo0815> thanks so far
[06:09:56] <shoky> dont know about the FF keeps loading thing..
[06:15:48] <beefz0r> doe anyone know why I can't join #javascript ?
[06:16:13] <shoky> beefz0r: you need to register your nickname. also it's ##javascript
[06:16:37] <beefz0r> whats the command for that
[06:16:46] <shoky> /msg nickserv help register
[06:17:42] <beefz0r> cheers shoky
[06:18:11] <Lindrian> I HATE jquery and ajax
[06:18:15] <Lindrian> this is proper bullshit
[06:18:16] <Lindrian> >_<
[06:18:28] <dipser> hater
[06:18:56] <Lindrian> cant get it to work
[06:18:56] <Lindrian> jesus
[06:20:05] <juha_> wut
[06:20:05] <b-ot> If i use jquery in noconflict plugin will work fine as $?
[06:20:24] <juha_> ajax with jquery is the easiest way of doing ajax
[06:22:51] <Ankabout> I'm getting a Javascript Obfuscation Threat 156 error on one of my sites, and all I have in my js file is some simple jquery
[06:22:57] <Ankabout> any ideas what I need to look for?
[06:22:59] <shoky> Lindrian: your paste link is dead, can you paste again?
[06:23:30] <Lindrian> yeah let me get some fresh code

[06:25:29] <Lindrian> shoky: "
[06:25:33] <Lindrian> shoky: ^
[06:25:41] <Lindrian> the code isnt perfect, clustered and what not.

[06:25:53] <shoky> this works fine: http://jsfiddle.net/dcpbr/1/
[06:26:10] <Ankabout> oh wow, it seems the JS file was hacked!
[06:26:24] <Lindrian> shoky: this is what im trying to do
[06:26:43] <Lindrian> When a user inputs stuff into one of the inputs, it sends a request. If he types some more, I send a new one and cancel and/or ignore the previous one.
[06:26:56] <shoky> yep
[06:27:02] <Lindrian> If the request time outs, I want the user to be informed and then after that automatically retry.
[06:27:21] <Lindrian> If the user starts typing again when we're automatically retrying, we cancel the retry and continue as normal.
[06:27:27] <Lindrian> So far I have been unable to get that working.
[06:28:18] <Lindrian> Can you help me modify my code shoky ?
[06:28:23] <Lindrian> I have tried for hours
[06:28:32] <shoky> Lindrian: i've added one line to the fiddle- http://jsfiddle.net/dcpbr/2/
[06:28:44] <shoky> to the error callback:  if (textStatus == 'abort') return;
[06:28:56] <shoky> so it'll only run if there's a timeout or some other error
[06:29:13] <shoky> can you work the fiddle's logic into your code or you want me to do it for you? :P
[06:29:43] <Lindrian> I can
[06:29:47] <Lindrian> what does "delay 3" mean?
[06:30:10] <shoky> it just tells jsfiddle's ajax echo thing to wait 3 seconds before replying
[06:30:16] <Lindrian> ok.
[06:30:28] <shoky> (you dont need that in your code, obviously)
[06:30:53] <shoky> and you don't need the 'num' thing, i just put that to make the console log clearer
[06:33:13] <Lindrian> yeah shoky
[06:33:16] <Lindrian> let me try it out
[06:33:36] <Lindrian> bah
[06:33:45] <Lindrian> it works, but when I auto-retry I can't make it sto
[06:33:46] <Lindrian> stop*
[06:33:54] <Lindrian> it just keeps on retrying forever
[06:34:19] <shoky> setTimeout(updateRegex, 2000);   that's the auto-retry ?
[06:34:27] <Lindrian> yes, hold on.
[06:34:28] <Lindrian> new code
[06:36:26] <Flo0815> shoky: i changed the preloader but now it seems that the whole browser gets stuck. http://jsfiddle.net/e2ckn/1/
[06:36:34] <Flo0815> am i doing this right?
[06:36:56] <shoky> nope
[06:36:59] <Flo0815> -.- damn
[06:37:02] <Lindrian> shoky: http://pastebin.com/ZTM8E3Wm
[06:37:53] <Lindrian> But yes, that 2000ms timeout is the "auto retry"
[06:39:27] <Mosselmaniac> hi all.
[06:39:30] <Flo0815> hi
[06:40:06] <Mosselmaniac> I have a question...
[06:40:22] <Mosselmaniac> on a click event i do: var myS=this;
[06:40:29] <shoky> Flo0815: more like http://jsfiddle.net/e2ckn/3/
[06:40:31] <Mosselmaniac> and then myForm = myS.parent();
[06:40:37] <shoky> flo oops
[06:41:04] <Flo0815> shoky: ah oops :)
[06:41:05] <Mosselmaniac> however, i get: parent is not a function?
[06:41:24] <Flo0815> Mosselmaniac: try $(this)
[06:41:37] <Mosselmaniac> if i do: console.log (myS); there i see the correct parentElement
[06:41:39] <mattfield> Mosselmaniac: if you're setting var myS = this from inside your click, use $(this)
[06:42:01] <Flo0815> shoky: config.imagecoutner is a number
[06:42:10] <Mosselmaniac> mattfield, Flo0815: nice it works :) thx tons!
[06:42:13] <shoky> Flo0815 yeah i just realized that
[06:42:21] <Mosselmaniac> could somebody elaborat?
[06:42:48] <Flo0815> shoky: thats why i used the for-loop in front
[06:43:02] <mattfield> Mosselmaniac: jQuery events bind $(this) to refer to the element you attach the event to
[06:43:36] <mattfield> Mosselmaniac: using this without wrapping it in jQuery refers outermost to the window object, and not the element you're attaching your event to
[06:43:43] <shoky> Flo0815: yeah i cahnged it back to a for, but now with the local function scope: http://jsfiddle.net/e2ckn/5/
[06:44:26] <Mosselmaniac> mattfield: i need to reread that a couple of times.
[06:44:28] <shoky> Lindrian: the first argument to the error callback is NOT data
[06:44:37] <shoky> Lindrian: error means error, there _is_ no data
[06:44:46] <Lindrian> what
[06:44:54] <Lindrian> I used to be able to do function(data) earlier?
[06:45:02] <shoky> no ;>
[06:45:03] <mattfield> Mosselmaniac: the this keyword is one of those gotchas in JavaScript. worth having a good read-up on it :)
[06:45:14] <Lindrian> okay uh
[06:45:14] <Lindrian> so
[06:45:19] <Lindrian> var json = $.parseJSON(data); is always null in error?
[06:45:39] <shoky> probably. you dont get errors in the conosle?
[06:45:50] <Mosselmaniac> mattfield: is it the same as passing an object by reference, or passing it by value?
[06:45:53] <Lindrian> no i dont
[06:46:19] <shoky> ah right $.parseJSON swallows exceptions
[06:46:40] <Lindrian> heh
[06:46:41] <Lindrian> uncool :p
[06:47:09] <Lindrian> Okay then. Fixed that. But it still keeps retrying
[06:47:21] <Lindrian> I want it to stop doing that as soon as I start typing or do pretty much anything
[06:48:25] <user___> hello
[06:48:51] <user___> can i eval a script on a div only?
[06:49:57] <seutje> you can force the "this" context, but evalling on a div only would require it to be isolated in its own window or something, I suppose
[06:50:09] <mattfield> Mosselmaniac: not really. When you use $(this) from within a jQuery event bind, jQuery just calls either call() or apply() (I forget which) to set the context correctly.
[06:50:10] <shoky> Lindrian: it doesn't stop retrying even if you type?
[06:50:33] <Mosselmaniac> mattfield: i will dive into it thx
[06:50:50] <mattfield> Mosselmaniac: no worries. jQuery has $.proxy that does the same thing. good luck!
[06:50:54] <Lindrian> it eventually does, shoky
[06:51:49] <Lindrian> i just want it to immediately drop it and continue
[06:52:18] <shoky> i'd think it would do that , from the code
[06:52:42] <shoky> what exactly happens/
[06:52:44] <shoky> ?
[06:53:03] <user___> so can i $('#id').globalEval(myscript);
[06:53:32] <shoky> user___: no
[06:54:44] <mattfield> user___: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.globalEval/
[06:54:45] <user___> shoky:  how can i do it then, you may have a link for me to read it and learn it ?
[06:55:00] <shoky> user___: i don't know what you wanna do exactly
[06:55:20] <user___> having a script from ajax and want to execute it in a "sandbox"
[06:55:24] <Anticom> hi all
[06:55:34] <mattfield> user___: you use globalEval() to execute code *globally*
[06:55:43] <shoky> user___: i think only an iframe could give you something like that..
[06:55:55] <Anticom> is there a way to register key handlers on buttons of jq-dialogs?
[06:56:10] <Anticom> i mean is there any smart way
[06:58:59] <user___> shoky: hm yeah iframe, but then the location and ref differs :/
[07:00:02] <mattfield> user___, what're you trying to achieve?
[07:00:17] <shoky> user___: browser javascript code runs in the context of a window , not in the context of some inner element
[07:00:23] <shoky> afaik.
[07:00:43] <shoky> user___: (and an iframe constitutes a window)
[07:01:09] <shoky> no idea if constitutes is the proper word there ;S
[07:01:30] <mattfield> shoky: yeah, it is ;)
[07:01:37] <shoky> yey
[07:06:10] <Lindrian> shoky: sorry if im slow
[07:06:24] <Lindrian> it just keeps going, keeps retrying for like 5-10 times more, then it does what I wanted it to do earlier
[07:06:27] <Lindrian> which is simply stop
[07:07:06] <Lindrian> shoky: if i dont answer in like 5 secs, highlight me.
[07:07:40] <shoky> Lindrian: and what about the key you typed to stop the retries? does that request get sent fine?
[07:08:13] <shoky> Lindrian: and paste new code plz
[07:09:07] <Lindrian> hold on
[07:09:12] <jn_> anyone have experience with nivo slider? Initially the first image is some pixels higher than it should be, then when I click next the images get the correct height but whenever there is a transition the image "jumps"
[07:09:51] <Lindrian> shoky: http://pastebin.com/8k6giL11
[07:12:56] <shoky> Lindrian: and what is your php doing?
[07:13:17] <Lindrian> It does some regex stuff in the background and then outpus json data
[07:14:18] <shoky> yeah but how long does it take
[07:14:34] <Lindrian> shoky: typically very very fast, like 10ms or something
[07:14:35] <shoky> i mean.. does it timeout each time or what
[07:14:41] <Lindrian> perhaps 100ms on a bad day
[07:14:44] <Lindrian> no, it doesnt
[07:14:45] <shoky> so how are you getting it to retry?
[07:15:01] <Lindrian> I've created an infinite loop in my script
[07:15:10] <Lindrian> which would simulate super long execution time
[07:15:14] <shoky> so _that's_ what your php is doing :P
[07:15:18] <Lindrian> lol
[07:15:21] <Lindrian> yeah i guess
[07:15:36] <shoky> so, let's say you type some shit, so you get a timeout
[07:15:40] <shoky> so it starts retrying
[07:15:47] <shoky> you keep getting timeouts, it keeps retrying
[07:15:56] <shoky> you type something, you keep getting timeouts, it keeps retrying
[07:15:59] <shoky> am i missing someth?
[07:16:26] <Lindrian> no thats fine
[07:16:33] <Parhs> shoky you sent me this ? http://parhs.no-ip.org/gallery/test/cache/my_slideshow/gallery/test/images.jpg
[07:16:35] <Lindrian> but if i type something else that doesnt go into a loop
[07:16:37] <Lindrian> it keeps retrying
[07:16:38] <Parhs> i dont remember
[07:16:51] <ruby_on_tails> hello
[07:16:57] <shoky> Parhs lol no that was someone else
[07:17:00] <Lindrian> I want it to stop retrying instantly, and cancel the retry-request
[07:17:01] <sukhu> s
[07:17:03] <shoky> maybe LindsayMac but i'm not sure
[07:17:03] <Parhs> heh
[07:17:09] <Parhs> maybe
[07:17:16] <Lindrian> you follow shoky ?
[07:18:03] <shoky> sort of
[07:18:50] <shoky> so let's say typing 1 triggers a timeout loop and typing 2 triggers immediate response
[07:19:06] <shoky> you type 1, and then 2 right away. what happens?
[07:20:22] <shoky> oh, wiat.
[07:20:23] <shoky> wait
[07:20:25] <Lindrian> If you type 1, send a request, go into a retry loop and then type 2, I want you to cancel the request for '1' and then send a new request for '2'
[07:20:46] <shoky> exactly
[07:20:55] <shoky> so your code is missing the 'cancel the request' part
[07:21:07] <shoky> er
[07:21:11] <shoky> sorry
[07:21:14] <shoky> that was dumb
[07:21:18] <Lindrian> oh
[07:21:24] <Lindrian> i thought if (xhr && xhr.state() == 'pending') { xhr.abort(); } did that
[07:21:27] <shoky> yes :)
[07:22:04] <shoky> ah
[07:22:12] <shoky> take out the 'xhr = null' from everywhere
[07:22:20] <shoky> should fix it
[07:23:20] <Lindrian> give me a sec
[07:23:39] <raj> yo shoky
[07:23:42] <raj> wutup bro
[07:23:47] <shoky> hey rajy
[07:23:57] <shoky> oks not terrible, wassup homey
[07:24:08] <raj> just at work
[07:24:10] <shoky> how's the jerb
[07:24:11] <raj> making that paypah
[07:24:16] <shoky> sweet
[07:24:27] <raj> no, joking, I'm paying up the ass to be treated like a slave
[07:24:35] <shoky> lol
[07:25:00] <shoky> good thing you like that kinda treatment
[07:25:34] <Lindrian> uhm shoky
[07:25:36] <Lindrian> its still weird
[07:25:49] <shoky> weird is good
[07:26:07] <Lindrian> :(
[07:26:10] <shoky> ;[
[07:26:22] <raj> yeah, <~~ masochist
[07:26:29] <Lindrian> it works... sometimes
[07:26:34] <Lindrian> its ultra scetchy though
[07:28:14] <NodeX> Lindrian : are you wanting it to cancel the request once it's fired?
[07:28:22] <NodeX> or stop the request firing completely?
[07:29:04] <Lindrian> im not sure what the difference is
[07:29:08] <Lindrian> i just want to kill it entirely
[07:29:34] <NodeX> if it's already fired then it's not possible
[07:29:57] <shoky> he doesnt care if it reaches the server or not
[07:30:13] <NodeX> you would have to write some logic to attach an identifier that the correct response to parse contained said identifier
[07:31:16] <NodeX> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4551175/how-to-cancel-abort-jquery-ajax-request <-- perhaps that can help / shed some light
[07:31:55] <Lindrian> i dont have to cancel it
[07:31:57] <Lindrian> just ignore it
[07:31:59] <Lindrian> i dont want it anymore
[07:32:38] <NodeX> then I suggest you attach an incrementing number to your request and compare them on the inbound response
[07:32:59] <shoky> that was the first thing i said too, Lindrian ;P
[07:33:08] <Lindrian> Add a number?
[07:33:11] <Lindrian> How do I do that?
[07:33:16] <shoky> check my fiddle
[07:33:29] <Lindrian> phew, still open in my browser lol
[07:33:30] <NodeX> I dont see the problem tbh, I wrote a suggestive serach widget that does it with relative ease
[07:33:40] <NodeX> search*
[07:33:53] <Lindrian> so then i do
[07:34:00] <Lindrian> if (json.num == num) { ?
[07:34:13] <NodeX> possibly, but I still dont get how your's doesnt work
[07:34:19] <NodeX> would you like to see how I do mine?
[07:34:23] <shoky> me too
[07:34:36] <Lindrian> hold on, I'll give you access to the site in a second
[07:34:39] <Lindrian> let me try this number thing
[07:35:05] <batdorf> hi :) I'd like to have the entire screen scroll up one pixel when a user "does" something. It would be on condition that the page height exceeds the browser height, but I'll add that part in
[07:35:32] <batdorf> or does "something", not sure how to "quote" that
[07:35:37] <batdorf> ;-)
[07:35:53] <shoky> ";-)"
[07:37:33] <batdorf> are you sure?
[07:37:38] <NodeX> Lindrian : http://pastie.org/4400103
[07:37:54] <Lindrian> bah
[07:37:55] <Lindrian> i fucked it up
[07:38:51] <NodeX> that ^ works, it's wrapped in a keyup bind... after 400ms if a keyup is not fired then the $.post is sent
[07:39:03] <NodeX> else a keyup fires and the 400ms timer starts agin]
[07:39:06] <NodeX> again *
[07:39:25] <NodeX> PM's are blocked
[07:39:40] <Lindrian> Did that work NodeX ?
[07:40:27] <Lindrian> shoky: I pmed the link to you too
[07:41:27] <opalepatrick> I am using jquery.datables to access another php script via ajax and return json encoded data. This all works fine. Question is, is this json_encoded output available to the rest of the originating php script to decode or is only confined to the jquery function? I just cant get as dump of the output anywhere else.
[07:41:34] <NodeX> Lindrian : your's works fine
[07:41:47] <batdorf> i think i got it shoky
[07:41:59] <Lindrian> NodeX: Trigger the timeout using [stuff] or anything inside square brackets
[07:42:01] <NodeX> the requests are cancelled
[07:42:13] <Lindrian> The "clear fields" button should entirely kill and reset the view
[07:42:25] <Lindrian> If it's in a timeout it doesnt seem to do that properly..
[07:42:44] <Lindrian> Type in [hello] or something, you'll see requests going, then timing out, then going again, etc
[07:42:59] <Lindrian> Then try hitting "clear fields" in the middle of that or type something else. It's not really working flawlessly.
[07:43:16] <NodeX> use the pattern I pastebin'd
[07:44:52] <Lindrian> i dont know how to integrate that into my code NodeX
[07:45:28] <NodeX> $("the-element-you-type-in").keyup(function(event){ .... code in here });
[07:45:46] <NodeX> make sure the "var timeouts;" is outside that scope
[07:46:10] <Lindrian> but i already have such a timeout...?
[07:46:18] <Lindrian> well, a similar one
[07:46:37] <NodeX> Similar is not equal to
[07:46:53] <Lindrian> Only difference is that yours is doing a post request for some reason?
[07:49:23] <NodeX> and what does yours do?
[07:49:59] <Lindrian> NodeX:  it calls a function that does the request instead
[07:50:04] <Lindrian> so they're pretty much identical..?
[07:52:55] <demetan> can I  append a div whom load some code ?  something like that if I am clear : $('#example').append(('#bis').load('controls.html')); ??
[07:53:17] <NodeX> who know's if they're the same, I didn't check your code
[08:02:51] <LindsayMac> Hey.. can someone tell me why this code isn't working. I am trying to call a .css and .animation when an <h1> tag is 25 pixels from the top using "offset()top"
[08:02:51] <LindsayMac> http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/Etsze/3/
[08:03:35] <NodeX> what "doesnt work" about it?
[08:04:10] <LindsayMac> NodeX:  it does not trigger the animation when you get 25px from top..
[08:04:36] <jimblanc> Hey everyone! I am using jQueryUI's selectable feature and I was wondering if there is a way to determine the last item selected when using the "selectablestop" event.
[08:05:14] <jimblanc> That is, if I were to drag and select a bunch of elements, how would I know what one was the last one in the selection? (E.g. if selecting to the right, the last one would be the right most and vice-versa for left)
[08:05:16] <jimblanc> Any ideas?
[08:08:13] <Grundell> Hello
[08:08:18] <Grundell> I have a small problem
[08:08:34] <Grundell> i cant get my js to keep the page open
[08:08:44] <Grundell> sorry menu open on active
[08:09:20] <NodeX> LindsayMac : I think you're bound to the wrong element that's scrolling
[08:09:39] <LindsayMac> NodeX:  what should I be bound to? These are things I am still learning about with jquery
[08:10:18] <mattfield> LindsayMac: you should be binding your scroll event to the window, not to the h1
[08:10:24] <NodeX> ^^
[08:10:33] <mattfield> ;)
[08:10:41] <Lindrian> NodeX: were you able to reproduce the error?
[08:10:46] <Lindrian> i think shoky  was
[08:10:48] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  that doesn't make sense.. I only want the event to trigger when the <h1> is at the top?
[08:10:58] <NodeX> Lindrian : As I said, use the example I posted
[08:11:09] <dschuett> any reason when you click in the Notes field and make a change then click out that it does everything within the .change function twice? http://jsfiddle.net/3MwXd/8/
[08:11:15] <LindsayMac> bear with me. I am new and trying to understand this.
[08:11:16] <Lindrian> But why? That just makes stuff really complicated :S
[08:11:16] <NodeX> LindsayMac : The scroll happens on window though
[08:11:23] <Lindrian> Why cant I use a separate method for the ajax call?
[08:11:36] <NodeX> Lindrian : do what you feel you need to
[08:11:36] <ravenzz> any good forms validator plugin out there?
[08:11:42] <LindsayMac> NodeX:  but in that case, how would I make sure to trigger the animations based on the location of the <h1>
[08:11:44] <mattfield> LindsayMac: the scroll event fires every time the element it's attached to is scrolled. your don't scroll an h1 element, but you do scroll the window.
[08:11:52] <ravenzz> http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/ ?
[08:11:56] <ravenzz> ?validate
[08:12:14] <LindsayMac> ohh... so that makes sense..
[08:12:39] <Lindrian> NodeX: I want my code to work properly. Your example code does the same mine does and mine does not work.
[08:12:56] <LindsayMac> So I need to bind to the window, but I need to only trigger it when the <h1> tag is in view. Any direction on how to do that? A link to something would be helpful, not asking anyone to do it for me
[08:13:19] <mattfield> LindsayMac: So the thing to do, is to attach the scroll event to the window, and then detect when an h1 reaches 25px offset, then fire your animations and whatnot
[08:13:53] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  I understand the logic.. I am looking up the syntax to make that happen
[08:14:06] <NodeX> Lindrian : it obviously does NOT do the same as yours because mine works and yours doesnt
[08:14:23] <Lindrian> ...
[08:14:27] <Lindrian> Mine works too in that aspect
[08:14:42] <Lindrian> But it still does not entirely do what I want it to do
[08:16:05] <mattfield> LindsayMac: Well, the scroll event fires every single time someone scrolls, so there's no way to make that event fires conditional. So, within your scroll event, pop in a few conditional saying something like if ($('#panel4 h1').offset({ top: 25 }) { ..run your animations.. }
[08:16:32] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  ok.. That makes sense.. So its one event with multiple conditionals..
[08:16:48] <NodeX> you can only fire scroll on a div if you're inside the div and it has a scroll bar
[08:16:58] <NodeX> otherwise it fires on the windwo
[08:17:07] <mattfield> NodeX: it's not in a div, it's on the window
[08:17:11] <mattfield> *window
[08:17:19] <NodeX> I didn't say it was IN the div
[08:17:28] <NodeX> I said you "can only fire on a div"
[08:17:37] <NodeX> .. if you're over a div
[08:17:38] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  Ohhh i'm getting closer i think
[08:17:38] <b-ot> NodeX, no YOU'RE over a div
[08:18:45] <xec_> that bot triggers on the strangest things, doesn't it
[08:18:51] <NodeX> yer lol
[08:21:12] <drakythe> So i have found a variation of this question: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-cycle-images-drop-out-sometimes on about 3 different sites, but none have an answer. Is there a known solution for this issue? (jquery.cycle images dropping out after a while)
[08:21:59] <LindsayMac> NodeX and mattfield (if you have a moment) I am getting closer. I have if #Panel4 is offset()top 25 animate this way, if it's not, do this.. http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/Etsze/6/
[08:22:54] <mattfield> LindsayMac: your offset should be called like this: .offset({ top: 25 })
[08:23:05] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  Ohh thanks.
[08:23:36] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  with that, how would do != 25 ?
[08:25:16] <LindsayMac> Oh wow.. that's weird.. adding it that way has actually changed the top: location of the <h1> tag.. not what I was trying to do. I am not trying to change the offset()top I am trying to get it and use it as a trigger
[08:25:58] <mattfield> LindsayMac: there might be something wrong with your conditionals. have you got an updated fiddle
[08:26:00] <mattfield> ?
[08:26:24] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  sure one sec.
[08:27:41] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  i also changed 25 to 0 just because I can be sure i'm always scrolling to the very top and not be 1px off http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/Etsze/8/
[08:29:00] <jomofcw> I have a list of A element. I will add some new A loading those from AJAX. How can I attache an handler to all existing A and to all A I will attach in future ? I know .live() is deprecated... but could I do it with .on() ?
[08:29:30] <xec_> jomofcw: yes :)
[08:29:46] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  in fact, it SEEMS like the way i had it was closer to working. http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/Etsze/9/
[08:30:05] <mattfield> LindsayMac: hang on a sec, there are syntax errors here
[08:30:11] <dschuett> why is my .change getting called TWICE? http://jsfiddle.net/3MwXd/8/
[08:30:13] <xec_> jomofcw: something like $("myParentElementWhichIsAlwaysThere").on("click", "a", func)
[08:30:24] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  ok.. I am sure there are. Thats the part i've been struggling with. I have the logic.
[08:30:46] <jomofcw> xec_ thanks !
[08:30:56] <vsmith> Hey all im using a quickflip script on my homepge and ive got some wierd things going on
[08:31:08] <mattfield> LindsayMac: sure thing. if there are syntax errors, the script either won't run or won't run properly
[08:31:38] <vsmith> can anyone point me in the right direction?
[08:31:46] <vsmith> this is my homepage http://dev.diversitynetworkingroup.com/
[08:33:23] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  oh yea. I know that for sure... I do php often, so again, i "get" the logic but the syntax and some of the new elements are new to me
[08:33:39] <mattfield> LindsayMac: Sure. Working on it here.
[08:33:40] <vsmith> under the area where it says  "your next success steps"
[08:33:54] <LindsayMac> thx so much mattfield
[08:34:05] <mattfield> LindsayMac: For our purposes, can I just kill all the commented-out code?
[08:34:14] <mattfield> LindsayMac: it's getting in the way ^^
[08:34:15] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  absolutely
[08:35:18] <LindsayMac> that was there because it basically was a working script, but not working the best it should be, so I was using it to help guide me in getting the syntax right.. or at least see how it WAS working
[08:36:17] <mattfield> LindsayMac: cool, no worries
[08:41:13] <WDKevin> I currently have some actions on the receive event on UI's sortable plugin. Is there no support to add an element from an onclick or does it only work when dragging and dropping?
[08:45:18] <Grundell> HEllo, i want this menu to stay open if http://jsfiddle.net/RfZVv/, if i'm on one of the sub pages.
[08:45:25] <Grundell> Is any one able to help me out ?
[08:45:34] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  you are using wordpress right?
[08:45:40] <Grundell> Yepp
[08:46:29] <LindsayMac> Just add some css to .page-id-99 .company-nav ul li ul {  }
[08:46:53] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  i know you showed me a link to your site the other day.. can you post it again?
[08:47:01] <Grundell> Well since i have a js on it it seams like it doesn't want to
[08:47:10] <LindsayMac> let me see..
[08:47:18] <LindsayMac> you can add an !important to your see to override the JS
[08:47:23] <Grundell> http://www.copypanthers.com/lost-in-translation-agency
[08:48:22] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  what theme are you using/ you really should have the body_class applied to the body
[08:48:34] <boulet101010_> http://jsfiddle.net/FdtYw/ can somebody tell me if there is a smarter way to code this?
[08:48:47] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  add this to your <body> tag <?php body_class($class); ?>
[08:49:07] <dschuett> can i bind jquery to dynamically loaded content by using the ajax complete function?
[08:49:10] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  THEN you can do what I said
[08:49:15] <Grundell> current-menu-item - should be able to handle it but it seams like it doesn't want to work with me...
[08:49:41] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  but not just for unique pages...
[08:49:52] <LindsayMac> current-menu-item is going to work on ALL current menu item s
[08:50:18] <Grundell> added to my theme
[08:50:39] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  you didn't add it correctly
[08:50:55] <Grundell> Noticed it should be within body class="<?php body_class($class); ?>		"
[08:50:57] <Grundell> =
[08:50:58] <Grundell> ?
[08:50:59] <boulet101010_> http://jsfiddle.net/FdtYw/1/http://jsfiddle.net/FdtYw/1/ updated
[08:51:09] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  no.. you are wrong
[08:51:13] <LindsayMac> it should not be that..
[08:51:25] <Grundell> what should it be ? :) ?
[08:51:31] <LindsayMac> without the class=""
[08:51:39] <LindsayMac> as i said.. add that code to your <body> tag
[08:51:41] <hoolter> are spaces legal in var identifier names?
[08:51:56] <Grundell> added ;)
[08:51:57] <hoolter> function i\ contain\ spaces() { return 'foo'; }
[08:51:58] <LindsayMac> hoolter:  i wouldnt use spaces in a variable
[08:52:15] <dschuett> frustrating = being ignored in an IRC channel
[08:52:19] <Grundell> What did you say i should do after that ?=
[08:52:32] <hoolter> LindsayMac: yes, but is it legal?
[08:52:47] <LindsayMac> no idea. sorry
[08:52:50] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  nope
[08:53:07] <hoolter> LindsayMac: What I'm asking is really, why are JSON keys quoted?
[08:53:20] <Grundell> LindsayMac - sorry don't fallow <body <?php body_class($class); ?>		 >
[08:53:24] <LindsayMac> hoolter:  sorry.. I dont have that answer..
[08:53:36] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  yes.. you got it. I never said put it after =
[08:54:04] <hoolter> no worries LindsayMac
[08:54:06] <jayant> hi, i am using JQM and i designed a prototype but i am stuck at getting the app to act, any references that might help?
[08:54:06] <Grundell> LindsayMac should it be before ?
[08:54:39] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  i said you got it
[08:54:44] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  add this to your css #page-id-6758 #menu-item-7637 ul {display:block;}
[08:54:46] <Grundell> LindsayMac - How do i do to keep it open now ?  (yeah :P)
[08:55:00] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  chill out.. i am trying to help, but you're spazing.
[08:55:22] <Grundell> LindsayMac - Okay :P Excited!
[08:55:37] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  try it and tell me when you did
[08:56:31] <Grundell> Done it, no effect
[08:56:51] <LindsayMac> hold on
[08:57:19] <Grundell> okay.
[08:58:13] <LindsayMac> Try changing the first part to this:  #page-id-6758 #sitemap  #menu-item-7637 ul
[08:58:57] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  have you gotten anywhere with my syntax issue ? Just curious, because if youre busy, if you can just give me a pointer where i'm messed up I can work on it
[08:59:12] <Grundell> LindsayMac - nor result...
[08:59:54] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  hold on
[08:59:59] <Grundell> yes
[09:01:16] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  try removing the #page-id and #sidemap part just so I can see if it's registering it at all.. we can work about the per-page only later
[09:02:02] <Grundell> lindsayMac - you mean body id and sitemap
[09:02:08] <LindsayMac> yea
[09:03:33] <Grundell> Now its there
[09:03:44] <LindsayMac> k
[09:03:58] <Grundell> Or rather the changes
[09:04:34] <LindsayMac> erm... what did you do? The #sitemap selector is done from your structure
[09:04:51] <LindsayMac> gone*
[09:04:55] <Grundell> i removed the id site map
[09:05:03] <LindsayMac> No i meant from the CSS!
[09:05:07] <Grundell> ahh okay
[09:05:45] <Grundell> LindsayMac - all of the site map style ?
[09:06:06] <mattfield> LindsayMac: Ok, right. The one problem with your setup here, is that this is only going to work if you land EXACTLY on the correct offset for the div. if someone just flicks
[09:06:07] <LindsayMac> JUST remove the two things I told you do.. just those TWO THINGS form what I gave you before
[09:06:22] <mattfield> LindsayMac: …their scroll wheel/trackpad, it'll fly past and won't display
[09:06:29] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  well.. the good thing is that I am using a smoothscroll to make it snap to it's location
[09:06:41] <Grundell> everything is coded with #sitemap xx xx xx
[09:06:57] <LindsayMac> omg Grundell
[09:07:08] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  change this:  #page-id-6758 #sitemap  #menu-item-7637 ul
[09:07:13] <LindsayMac> to this:   #menu-item-7637 ul
[09:07:21] <mattfield> LindsayMac: great! well, here's the very foundation of what should be going on. I've cleaned up a lot of the markup and the css, as that wasn't going to work as it was
[09:07:36] <Grundell> Then it works :)
[09:07:46] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  ok..
[09:07:51] <mattfield> LindsayMac: http://jsfiddle.net/mattfieldy/Etsze/40/
[09:08:07] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  i gotta bow out for a minute.. i need to check out what mattfield did for me
[09:08:26] <Grundell> LindsayMac Okay
[09:08:42] <mattfield> LindsayMac: there are no animations at the moment, but I'll pop those back in.
[09:08:50] <LindsayMac> mattfield: ok..
[09:09:14] <LindsayMac> i can see what you did for the most part. You are comparing the current location with the top of the browser location. Will that work with MULTIPLE containers?
[09:10:07] <mattfield> LindsayMac: just store the Y offset of each of your container divs, and compare them the scroll position.
[09:10:12] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  i thought you said it was working/
[09:10:39] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  ok. I am sure I can do that looking to what you did and "copying' in some want. Just wanted to make sure it was the right way to do it
[09:10:43] <Grundell> It did tested one thing han on and ill change it back
[09:11:05] <mattfield> LindsayMac: absolutely, yeah. just wanted to show you how to do it here before throwing in the animations again
[09:11:11] <Grundell> LindsayMac now it stays open all times
[09:11:45] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  that is HUGELY appreciated! The animations stuff I feel pretty confident in (not great, but I understand it a little better) but browser interactions are something I am still learning about. how to use .click and .scroll etc
[09:11:55] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  its supposed to do that at this point
[09:12:17] <Grundell> I've understood that :)
[09:12:36] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  add .page-id-6758 to the begining of that class i gave you before
[09:12:44] <LindsayMac> add it before the #menu-item
[09:12:52] <Grundell> yep
[09:13:08] <mattfield> LindsayMac: and there's a bit of animation back in to show you too http://jsfiddle.net/mattfieldy/Etsze/41/
[09:13:51] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  i'm not getting any changes occuring
[09:13:52] <Grundell> Sweet, seams like it works :)
[09:14:08] <mattfield> LindsayMac: try clicking on the panel4 anchor
[09:14:13] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  you're welcome
[09:14:16] <drewery> I am new to JQuery and I am wondering if there is a good recommendation for a good tutorial...
[09:14:20] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  i did..
[09:14:33] <mattfield> LindsayMac: http://jsfiddle.net/mattfieldy/Etsze/42/. what browser are you on?
[09:14:36] <pachet> drewery: are you new to javascript?
[09:14:44] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  I am using FF
[09:14:50] <mattfield> LindsayMac: ok, cool
[09:14:54] <Grundell> LindsayMac - Really appreciated
[09:15:10] <mattfield> LindsayMac: just tested in FF here and all's fine
[09:15:18] <LindsayMac> weird...
[09:15:30] <drewery> I have a programming background, I dealed with javascripting in development but only for what I needed
[09:15:34] <LindsayMac> i am getting no interaction from the scriot when I click on Panel4 OR when i scroll to it
[09:15:42] <LindsayMac> drewery:  ive been learning by doing, using the jquery UI docs, and the mozilla website
[09:15:46] <drewery> now I want to take it from scratch and learn in detail
[09:15:58] <mattfield> LindsayMac: hmm. is the console.log logging to firebug?
[09:16:17] <LindsayMac> OMg mattfield i'm an idiot.. i didnt see the console.log
[09:16:33] <mattfield> LindsayMac: ^^
[09:16:36] <LindsayMac> my yes glossed right by that.. but was looking for the animate:opacity mattfield
[09:16:52] <shoky> ?learn @ drewery
[09:16:52] <bot-t> drewery, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[09:17:27] <drewery> Thanks LindsayMac, I will look into that
[09:17:41] <mattfield> LindsayMac: so you're getting no events firing at all? no animations?
[09:17:42] <drewery> Thanks bot-t I wil check those links as well
[09:17:42] <LindsayMac> The mozilla website is really good.. I have a list of links I can find and pm you maybe
[09:18:37] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  nope.. the opacity:0 remains on the panel4 container
[09:19:01] <drewery> Yes, that mozilla website is really good! Thanks again!
[09:19:12] <mattfield> LindsayMac: Hmm. Really strange.
[09:19:13] <LindsayMac> :)
[09:19:26] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  i agree its strange. reading the code, it makes logical sense
[09:19:42] <LindsayMac> it should animate the #white_box and add opacity 1 right mattfield
[09:19:55] <mattfield> LindsayMac: that's right, yes.
[09:20:09] <drewery> LindsayMac: I would appreciate it if you could when you can, I like combining info from different sources
[09:20:10] <mattfield> LindsayMac: try scrolling past REALLY slowly ^^
[09:20:11] <LindsayMac> I can screen snap what I see.
[09:20:21] <LindsayMac> drewery:  absolutely
[09:20:22] <mattfield> LindsayMac: that'd be useful
[09:20:41] <Pinehead> I have multiple sources of jquery being included on one page.. Is it possible to use one and redefine it without the $ variable.  So $() is !() instead or something so the two versions of jquery don't conflict with each other?
[09:21:07] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  scrolling slowly doesn't change it/
[09:21:26] <mattfield> LindsayMac: any errors being console logged in Firebug?
[09:21:47] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  nope
[09:21:51] <LindsayMac> screenshots coming
[09:21:55] <Pinehead> ok, answered my own question.  .noconflict()
[09:22:21] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  here is what it looks like "starting" http://cl.ly/image/473l3K1B2V0T
[09:22:35] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  this is after clicking the link to panel4 http://cl.ly/image/0C1q411U2G1g
[09:22:52] <LindsayMac> again, scrolling slow or clicking to makes no difference
[09:23:33] <mattfield> LindsayMac: Double-check that jQuery is being loaded in from the drop down on the left
[09:23:48] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  yes, it is
[09:24:04] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  are you viewing it on FF as well?
[09:24:26] <LindsayMac> could it be the window top is not being triggered because of the jsfiddle iframe thing?
[09:24:30] <mattfield> LindsayMac: In Chrome. But I've just tested in FF, Safari and Opera as well and they're all running fine
[09:24:41] <LindsayMac> bizzare
[09:25:03] <mattfield> LindsayMac: that shouldn't make any difference; the iframe has it's own window
[09:25:11] <LindsayMac> true.. ok
[09:25:23] <mattfield> ok, guys out there, can we all double-check to see if this works for others? http://jsfiddle.net/mattfieldy/Etsze/44/
[09:25:47] <shoky> works for me
[09:26:30] <LindsayMac> Huh.. maybe i should refresh my browser?
[09:26:38] <LindsayMac> i mean restart
[09:26:39] <mattfield> Might be worth it
[09:27:06] <mattfield> maybe wipe your cache and whatnot as well
[09:27:23] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  doing it now.
[09:28:43] <shoky> the console log shows them as equal, yes? ;p
[09:29:21] <mattfield> shoky: muchos scrolling and clicking has been tried and neither work for LindsayMac
[09:30:16] <LindsayMac> Just whiped my cache, restarted my browser, opened the link from here that mattfield published in this window..
[09:30:35] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  maybe if the output window is too tall?
[09:30:55] <mattfield> LindsayMac: ah, yes, that's a good catch
[09:31:04] <LindsayMac> gonna resize and then shift + refresh
[09:31:35] <mattfield> LindsayMac: you need to be able to properly scroll to the area. console.log gives it as 1092px
[09:32:03] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  ok when I click on the link for panel4, i get these coordinates 1142.4499969482422 vs 1142
[09:32:05] <shoky> if you put a console.log inside the if block, does it log..
[09:32:12] <shoky> oh
[09:32:27] <mattfield> blimey
[09:32:49] <LindsayMac> So why is it looking for a millionth of a pixel ? haha
[09:33:03] <LindsayMac> could it be because of a high resolution monitor?
[09:33:46] <mattfield> LindsayMac: it's not a problem, we'll just round the integer
[09:33:53] <LindsayMac> ok cool
[09:34:45] <shoky> check for a range if you wanna be safe..
[09:35:15] <mattfield> LindsayMac: http://jsfiddle.net/mattfieldy/Etsze/45/
[09:35:16] <LindsayMac> shoky:  i think using a range would probably be beest
[09:35:17] <shoky> and that'd help for manual scrolling too
[09:35:25] <LindsayMac> WEEEEEE mattfield
[09:35:31] <mattfield> LindsayMac: yeah, probably a good idea
[09:35:39] <mattfield> ^^
[09:35:50] <LindsayMac> Awesome..
[09:36:18] <LindsayMac> So is the proper syntax for if it does NOT equal         if ($currentY != $scrollY) {
[09:36:30] <shoky> yes
[09:36:34] <mattfield> LindsayMac: yep
[09:36:51] <lilalinuxHamburg> My $.ajax() requests result in network request to ?../gadgets/makeRequest
[09:37:00] <LindsayMac> OMG OMG OMG mattfield and shoky HUGE HUGE HUGE for me!
[09:37:13] <niix> anyone here familiar with http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/ ?
[09:37:14] <shoky> dang
[09:37:14] <lilalinuxHamburg> Is that jquery behavior or does it come from my framework?
[09:37:33] <mattfield> And this is what rocks about hanging in IRC :D
[09:37:43] <mattfield> LindsayMac: SO glad to help!
[09:37:55] <LindsayMac> Seriously.. and in the meantime i was abe to help grundel with the issue he's had for 4+ days
[09:37:58] <ktstowell> irc++
[09:38:29] <LindsayMac> Even though i'm not the best at Jquery, I do know CSS and PHP inside and out. I always try to give back what i take out of a room..

[09:44:13] <ktstowell> it was my birthday and we made huge plans to go see it at OMSI (science museum in Portland, Or) but….beer. :(
[09:44:16] <CodesStuff> my aunt and cousin both work at nasa
[09:44:16] <jkarsrud> fat people dancing!
[09:44:18] <CodesStuff> everytime i see them
[09:44:21] <mattfield> Oh man, there were some serious high-five fails going on
[09:44:23] <CodesStuff> "OH WE'RE DOING THIS"
[09:44:31] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  RIGHT?!
[09:44:34] <CodesStuff> im like,  "NIGGA FUCK YOU I CODED A WEBAPP"
[09:44:39] <mattfield> LindsayMac: SERIOUSLY.
[09:44:57] <LindsayMac> and I also loved the guy with the mohawk with red stripes and bleached stars on the side of his head
[09:45:05] <LindsayMac> and the old hippie.. there was a little bit of everything in that room
[09:45:13] <mattfield> they were freakin' LOVING IT.
[09:45:21] <CodesStuff> hippies love science
[09:45:29] <LindsayMac> the guy who started crying and then felt like an idiot when no one else was
[09:45:48] <LindsayMac> come on.. that was some of the best TV on the webs last night
[09:45:58] <CodesStuff> http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/galileo/bios/segura.html
[09:46:02] <CodesStuff> my aunt and shit.
[09:46:13] <LindsayMac> and did you see the cool parallax website thing they made?
[09:46:18] <batdorf> Anyone familiar with manipulating touch controls?
[09:46:41] <mattfield> Think I missed a trick there...
[09:47:00] <LindsayMac> really CodesStuff ? cool
[09:47:11] <CodesStuff> she's kinda a dick
[09:47:14] <LindsayMac> hahaha
[09:47:30] <CodesStuff> her husband is a super controlling colombian dude
[09:47:37] <LindsayMac> yikes...
[09:47:38] <LindsayMac> http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/interactives/edlcuriosity/index-2.html
[09:47:39] <CodesStuff> and tries to lecture me at any given chance
[09:47:56] <LindsayMac> maybe you need some good lecturin' haha
[09:48:12] <CodesStuff> Naw. They're all about official titles and shit
[09:48:38] <CodesStuff> I'm CEO/CTO of several LLC's (granted I started them and only use them for tax stuff)
[09:48:40] <mattfield> Hah! That's pretty cool, yet still REALLY 1999.
[09:48:48] <CodesStuff> but they want me to be all fortune 500 bullshit
[09:48:53] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  right??? i was thinking the same thing
[09:49:02] <LindsayMac> CodesStuff:  meh.. sounds like my gramma
[09:49:29] <LindsayMac>  how that thing actually landed though.. is BEYOND me
[09:49:50] <mattfield> It's mind-boggling.
[09:50:31] <LindsayMac> one tiny little grain of sand landing on one side of that thing while i twas hovering and it would do a major spin into the universe
[09:50:38] <LindsayMac> mind bottling
[09:51:03] <mattfield> Haha! That site copy is hilarious. "The view? Like looking out the window of a plane. EXCEPT YOU ARE LANDING ON MARS!"
[09:51:22] <mattfield> Some serious thought went into that.
[09:51:31] <LindsayMac> OMG there was another really funny line.. lemme see if i can find it
[09:53:13] <LindsayMac> it looks like Johnny 5
[09:53:54] <rickibalboa> what would be the best way to tell if a div is in the current viewport, the div is inside an overflow div with a scrollbar, so say I'm scrolling through that div, then when a certain div enters the screen I can do something
[09:54:22] <LindsayMac> lol rickibalboa i was just doing something very similar
[09:54:42] <mattfield> now you can help others LindsayMac! :)
[09:54:42] <rickibalboa> yeah? Did you find a solution
[09:55:09] <LindsayMac> mattfield:  i can totally try
[09:55:23] <LindsayMac> rickibalboa:  can you make a quick jsfiddle with the markup of your page?
[09:55:46] <rickibalboa> uh, probably not, incredibly complex application i'm working on, give me 5 minutes and i'll mock something up i guess
[09:56:16] <LindsayMac> rickibalboa:  just the BASICS and the area where you will be working within. If its a div within a div that you wanna scroll through, make just that part
[09:56:41] <rickibalboa> yea I figured

[09:57:41] <Brodingo> rickibalboa check those out
[09:58:12] <LindsayMac> Blahh why didn't someone show me those earlier!
[09:58:13] <LindsayMac> haha
[09:58:34] <Brodingo> heh
[09:58:40] <Brodingo> enjoy
[09:58:59] <rickibalboa> Interesting but i'm trying to avoid the use of more plugins, I already have a heavy dependancy list
[09:59:04] <LindsayMac> Brodingo and rickibalboa i have this http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/Etsze/46/
[10:05:10] <ravenzz> any good form validator plugin?
[10:06:12] <Somatt> ravenzz: last time I checked the one from bassistance.de was a good pick
[10:06:17] <SkiOne> ravenzz: http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[10:08:21] <ravenzz> yep
[10:08:43] <ravenzz> it should be fine, do you know if it allows to get rid of the validation messages?
[10:09:20] <SkiOne> its fully customizable, it has defaults there as well as the ability to change the copy, formatting and location
[10:12:07] <spanglesontoast> anyone know why the setinterval and clearinterval functions are not working in this code http://jsfiddle.net/6BLSP/
[10:12:08] <ravenzz> thank you
[10:16:49] <rickibalboa> LindsayMac, I managed to develop a pretty simple solution here http://jsfiddle.net/zsZW2/2/
[10:17:52] <LindsayMac> Oh nice.
[10:18:00] <LindsayMac> thats similar to what I have at this point ..
[10:19:06] <rickibalboa> Yeah, seems to work pretty well for that I need it for, just a one time use, can't justify using a plugin for it.
[10:20:26] <boulet101010> http://jsfiddle.net/FdtYw/2/ is there a quicker way to do this?
[10:24:08] <jita> How can i call the function defined in outerblock in $.ajax? this._sendChatMessage() i want to call this inside ajax.
[10:24:43] <ravenzz> you should save a reference to this outside the ajax function
[10:25:12] <jita> ravenzz, send_function = this._sendCahtMessage() does not seem to work
[10:25:12] <ravenzz> var that = this; that._sendChatMessage();
[10:25:22] <LindsayMac> rickibalboa:  so did you end up answering your own question?
[10:25:53] <rabbi1> ravenzz: stuck with a small bit
[10:25:58] <rickibalboa> Well, kinda, with help from your jsfiddle :)
[10:26:46] <jita> ravenzz, is there a way to access the variable defined in ajax block in the outer block ?
[10:27:14] <ravenzz> wait weren't you asking the opposite?
[10:28:17] <jita> ravenzz, yeah this is the new problem :P
[10:28:36] <CodesStuff> I'vedecidedtoboycottspacebars.TheyrepresenteverythingthatIhate.
[10:29:40] <LindsayMac> rickibalboa:  YAY! happy it helped
[10:29:43] <jita> ravenzz, and also related to the previous problem, i did var parent = this; parent._sendChatMessage(chatInfo); it says illegal invocation
[10:30:36] <ravenzz> ?scope @ jita
[10:30:39] <bot-t> jita, #5798 (replaceWith(function) scope is broken)  jQuery Core - Bug ... - Opened 3 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5798
[10:30:41] <therealkoopa> Is it possible to bind to an image onload fn for imges that are created in JS, by new Image()?
[10:30:48] <ravenzz> nvm
[10:30:55] <ravenzz> we don't have that
[10:33:09] <jita> ravenzz, how can i solve this ?
[10:33:29] <ravenzz> you should read about the javascript scope
[10:34:35] <CodesStuff> what ravenzz said.
[10:36:32] <matsebc> Hello guys, not sure this is the proper place to ask but, is there any good html editor that supports mobile debugging? I am trying to create a simple page for iOS and would like a good editor for it
[10:38:16] <jita> If i create variable outside ajax, and assign its values in $.ajax success function, and in the outer scope the variable is undefined. example: var info; success: info = 'foo'; and outside ajax, console.log(info): undefined
[10:38:38] <LindsayMac> matsebc:  i use Firefox with firebug for that along with a useragent switch.. i am sure there's soemthing else out there, but thats what i use
[10:39:02] <matsebc> LindsayMac: yeah figured that would be one approach, thanks a bunch!
[10:39:25] <CodesStuff> matsebc: one minute lemme find it
[10:39:28] <LindsayMac> matsebc:  i've also only done some basic mobil WP themes
[10:39:38] <CodesStuff> there's this one emulator for like, TONS of devices
[10:39:51] <CodesStuff> it renders the page it all of their browsers, snapshots the screen
[10:41:26] <matsebc> CodesStuff: nice, I'll search for it on google
[10:41:30] <CodesStuff> matsebc: I can't find it. However, check out Bluestacks. Android and iOS render pages practically the same
[10:51:22] <matsebc> CodesStuff: thanks

[11:26:41] <jayant> hi, i want to use device-width as width of my canvas in jqm any ideas how??
[11:27:18] <jmaister> jayant: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4288253/html5-canvas-100-width-height-of-viewport ?
[11:29:13] <jayant> wow thanks :D,
[11:29:20] <jmaister> np :)
[11:34:30] <Gorkyman_> guys... whats the best way for using oauth with ajax call?
[11:35:27] <Haprog> jayant: btw if you want the fullscreen canvas to act the same way on mobile browsers you probably want to adda meta viewport definition like <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"> in the <head> see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag
[11:36:21] <jayant> haprog: i already added that but needed the same with my canvas on a page :)
[11:36:31] <Haprog> :)
[11:36:50] <CodesStuff> swag.
[11:39:33] <keirlav87> how do i select an input using the name attribute if the name is a form array?
[11:39:58] <keirlav87> eg $('input[name="hello[world]"]')
[11:40:15] <CodesStuff> console.log it
[11:40:18] <CodesStuff> and try it out :P
[11:40:32] <keirlav87> tried a couple havn't got it to work though
[11:40:37] <CodesStuff> I try to avoid serialized stuff, though
[11:40:55] <CodesStuff> oh, well strip out the name selector
[11:41:00] <CodesStuff> and choose something unique for it
[11:41:07] <CodesStuff> then console.log $(this)
[11:41:17] <CodesStuff> see what it spits out
[11:41:32] <keirlav87> will do, ta
[11:44:28] <lindsayo> I'm loading content from a query by an ajax get and stuffing it into a div.
[11:44:28] <lindsayo> On mobile, I want to slide the whole viewport over to the right to view that new content.
[11:44:28] <lindsayo> and then slide back when I close it.
[11:44:28] <lindsayo> Rather than pushing down my already long page further.
[11:44:45] <lindsayo> I don't know how to do that, though, move the whole viewport to the right.
[11:45:25] <xenaxon> hi. Guys a friend told me my jquery code is "atrocious". This is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/Zq8pc/
[11:45:36] <jmaister> lindsayo: http://jqueryui.com/docs/Effects/Slide
[11:45:38] <xenaxon> could anyone tell me what's wrong with it?
[11:45:43] <LindsayMac> uh-oh.. another lindsay...
[11:45:51] <lindsayo> on a Mac, even.
[11:45:58] <tw2113> *asplodes*
[11:46:00] <lindsayo> jmaister, thanks!
[11:46:02] <rue> Could be just Lindsa Yo
[11:46:04] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  instead of sliding the viewport, you slide the content beneath it
[11:46:14] <LindsayMac> rue:  true.. hah
[11:46:27] <xenaxon> can someone help me optimize/clean this code: http://jsfiddle.net/Zq8pc/
[11:46:34] <lindsayo> haha, that reminds me of Montgomery Scott "It never occurred to me to think of Space as the thing that's moving"
[11:47:08] <rue> xenaxon: I can’t, but it does look a little questionable.
[11:47:16] <LindsayMac> sometimes thinking of things differently is the path to the answer
[11:47:23] <lindsayo> yup
[11:47:37] <xenaxon> rue: what do you mean? why questionable?
[11:47:39] <tw2113> for the rest of the day, LindsayMac is "hey", and lindsayo is "yo"
[11:47:48] <lindsayo> ha
[11:47:51] <tw2113> </razorramon>
[11:48:20] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/Zq8pc/1/
[11:48:42] <LindsayMac> hahaa .. now i need to work out how to get my irc client to let me know everytime someone says HEY
[11:48:44] <LindsayMac> wait.. bad idea
[11:50:22] <tw2113> hey, hey, i got a PM for you
[11:50:48] <LindsayMac> Wooo
[11:51:19] <lindsayo> do you all hang out in here regularly?
[11:51:32] <tw2113> it's my house, i just host a constant party
[11:52:16] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  sadly..
[11:52:38] <lindsayo> I'm usually in 2 or 3 Drupal channels.
[11:52:55] <lindsayo> I should probably hang out more here, though as Im trying to improve my jQuery.
[11:52:56] * LindsayMac shudders ... drupal.. 
[11:53:08] <LindsayMac> me too lindsayo .. but i hang out in #wordpress
[11:53:19] <jmaister> That's how bloated drupal is. 3 channels!
[11:53:32] <lindsayo> jmaister, there are a lot more Drupal channels than that.
[11:53:34] <tw2113> i'm still boycotting that room
[11:53:45] <lindsayo> there are probably at least a couple dozen.
[11:53:58] <jmaister> haha. I'm not surprised
[11:54:09] <lindsayo> but we make fun of ourselves for it. webchick recently said she was gonna make a new channel for lesbian core developers.
[11:54:10] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  i know you are...
[11:54:14] <lindsayo> She'd be the only one in there...
[11:54:20] <LindsayMac> LOL!
[11:54:26] <LindsayMac> we need a girls-only dev channel.. ha
[11:54:35] <lindsayo> we have on in Drupal: #drupal-chix
[11:54:37] <lindsayo> oh wait
[11:54:37] <tw2113> and what would get done in there? *runs*
[11:54:39] <lindsayo> #drupalchix
[11:55:22] <LindsayMac> but i dont do drupal
[11:55:40] <tw2113> .....ray bradbury
[11:55:47] <lindsayo> Yeah, that's pretty fundamental LindsayMac
[11:56:06] <lindsayo> Seems like there should be an Ada Initiative channel
[11:56:21] <lindsayo> to cut across technology types
[11:56:35] <LindsayMac> yea
[11:56:50] <lindsayo> we face the same issues, regardless of what kind of programming we do.
[11:57:13] <LindsayMac> yea
[11:57:22] <tw2113> users?
[11:57:25] <tw2113> old browsers?
[11:57:29] <tw2113> forgotten semicolons?
[11:57:47] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  we know your obsession with semicolons
[11:58:06] <tw2113> better than colons *runs*
[11:58:58] <jmaister> perlmonging sysadmins rarely have those issues
[11:59:11] <jmaister> but then again, who'd want to be one
[11:59:17] <lindsayo> Is there better documentation or a tutorial for this somewhere? http://jqueryui.com/docs/Effects/Slide
[11:59:23] <lindsayo> Doesn't tell me much, even on the arguments tab.
[12:01:20] <lindsayo> jmaister, is this what I'm looking for: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7421905/how-to-use-jquery-ui-slide-effect-to-seemlessly-slide-out-one-div-and-slide-in-a   ?
[12:01:25] <jmaister> Docs are pretty bad. The demo has _some_ code http://jqueryui.com/demos/show/
[12:02:58] <LindsayMac> There is something REALLY REALLY strange happening..
[12:03:23] <tw2113> like politicians in office and we're back on mars
[12:03:56] <LindsayMac> no.. more strange
[12:04:37] <LindsayMac> Take a look at this example http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/Etsze/46/
[12:05:24] <LindsayMac> if you click on the Panel4 link, the content fades in and the whitebox drops down.. all good... but if you scroll manually a little and then click the button, nothing happens but if you wait long enough... it will drop down
[12:05:59] <motaka2> does anyone knows of a good link in which they teach how to make a very simple wysiwyg ?
[12:08:05] <ktstowell> You mean like, how to make a wysiwyg editor or how to implement your wysiwyg designs?
[12:09:25] <LindsayMac> it's so weird!! It's like theres a major delay in triggering the animation only if you scroll to the location versus just click
[12:09:58] <tw2113> different events not accounted for?
[12:11:08] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  its just looking for the position of the element in accordance with the offsettop..
[12:11:17] <ktstowell> LindsayMac: methinks you need to be making use of .stop() to control animation queueing
[12:11:25] <LindsayMac> and tw2113 it does work eventually.. its like a 30 sec. delay
[12:11:29] <LindsayMac> Ohhh ktstowell i'll try that '
[12:12:33] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  that made a HUGE difference in the responsiveness of the script.. but.. there is still a lag in one of the animations that is supposed to trigger at the same time
[12:13:11] <ktstowell> hmm
[12:14:19] <LindsayMac> What is even MORE strange is on my actual site, when I scroll to a location, the content fades in, and you see the whitebox height jumping around from 23px - 22.564846px to 21.5464564 to 23.56465464 and eventually it seems like it finally rests in place and THEN drops down
[12:14:57] <LindsayMac> I can take a screencast.. but its all very strange
[12:15:04] <ktstowell> you need to be putting your sequenced animations in the callback
[12:15:07] <ktstowell> ie:
[12:16:21] <ktstowell> $(elem).animate({'prop' : 'val'}, speed, function() { // now do your follow up animation $(second elem).animate() { ….}});
[12:16:32] <ktstowell> chaining .animate
[12:16:47] <ktstowell> will not reliably implement the queue
[12:16:53] <ktstowell> the docs lie
[12:16:55] <LindsayMac> ok..
[12:16:57] <ktstowell> dirty dirty lies
[12:17:01] <ktstowell> sec
[12:17:08] <LindsayMac> Ohh .. hmm ok
[12:17:35] <ktstowell> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[12:17:40] <ktstowell> the thrid param
[12:17:45] <ktstowell> erm
[12:17:46] <ktstowell> fourth
[12:17:47] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  i was JUST reading that..
[12:17:48] <ktstowell> is complete
[12:17:54] <ktstowell> menaing
[12:18:02] <ktstowell> this is what happens when the aniation finishes
[12:18:06] <ktstowell> animation*
[12:18:15] <ktstowell> so put any subsequent animations here
[12:18:19] <LindsayMac> what if i want both to happen at the same time?
[12:18:34] <ktstowell> oh
[12:18:50] <ktstowell> then just keep doing what yer doing _or_ instead of chaining them
[12:18:53] <LindsayMac> well.. i guess i COULD have the whitebox expand and then the content fade in
[12:19:02] <ktstowell> break them out into separate statements
[12:19:11] <ktstowell> tbh
[12:19:14] <LindsayMac> but would that really solve my issue with the whitebox not opening up sometimes or on a weird delay ?
[12:19:15] <ktstowell> doing one animation at a time
[12:19:21] <ktstowell> is much better on the browser
[12:19:28] <LindsayMac> k
[12:20:02] <tw2113> *boogies*
[12:20:10] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  any thoughts as to why the height of the white_box would jump around from 23px - 23.1231231 -23.2134 until it gets to the rightheight ?
[12:21:00] <ktstowell> becuase that's what happens when you animate widht and height
[12:21:18] <ktstowell> it calculates origin value - target value and speed
[12:21:25] <ktstowell> then adjusts over time accordingly
[12:21:58] <ktstowell> that goes for anything that has a spatial quality actually
[12:22:02] <LindsayMac> but over time... i mean, everything is stopped
[12:22:19] <ktstowell> over time meaning the speed param you provided
[12:22:27] <ktstowell> you say 400ms i believe
[12:22:35] <ktstowell> so
[12:22:37] <ktstowell> in 4ms
[12:22:48] <LindsayMac> right.. but that goes on for 30 seconds AFTER
[12:22:59] <LindsayMac> so it's not the 4ms duration.. its a LONG time..
[12:22:59] <ktstowell> it's going to go from teh original hieght to $windowHeight in 400ms
[12:23:03] <LindsayMac> lemme do a screencast maybe
[12:23:08] <ktstowell> oh insee
[12:23:10] <ktstowell> erm
[12:23:11] <ktstowell> i see
[12:23:11] <LindsayMac> OR i can just show you..
[12:23:15] <ktstowell> soryr eating mah lunch
[12:23:21] <LindsayMac> haha its ok!
[12:23:31] <ktstowell> also
[12:23:40] <ktstowell> because .animate uses the css coire
[12:23:42] <ktstowell> core
[12:23:53] <ktstowell> you should be putting key val pairs in ""
[12:23:57] <ktstowell> ie
[12:24:07] <ktstowell> "opacity" : "1"
[12:24:10] <ktstowell> dont have to
[12:24:11] <ktstowell> but
[12:24:16] <ktstowell> it's recommended
[12:24:22] <LindsayMac> k
[12:24:31] <ktstowell> less string manip it has to do
[12:24:37] <LindsayMac> If i'm using css then is there a need?
[12:24:45] <ktstowell> ywa
[12:24:47] <ktstowell> gah
[12:24:48] <DarkSector> For this particular jQuery UI demo http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#default How do I add the name of the droppable item to an array. I need to know how many draggable objects are lying in the droppable div. I have successfully highlighted the droppable div using drop: event but how do I get the name fo the draggable divs in the droppable div.
[12:24:50] <ktstowell> yeah
[12:24:58] <LindsayMac> k
[12:25:59] <johnkpaul> DarkSector: in the drop handler, do something with ui.draggable
[12:26:25] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  so if i use             $('#panel4').stop().css('visibility','visible').hide().fadeIn('400');  instead of the code on the fiddle which uses animate I should still use  " " around the keys ?
[12:26:50] <DarkSector> johnkpaul: okay but what if the draggable is the class rather than the id
[12:27:14] <johnkpaul> DarkSector: that doesn't matter, ui.draggable, I'm pretty sure is a reference to adom elemnt
[12:27:22] <ktstowell> why would you want to hide it immediately after making it visible - i could just not be understanding teh purpose
[12:27:35] <ktstowell> also
[12:27:44] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  it needs to be hidden, but it needs to be visible quickly so I can apply another script to it..
[12:27:44] <ktstowell> you can only call stop on something that has a queue
[12:28:05] <ktstowell> so swap stop and .css
[12:28:12] <LindsayMac> Ahhhh k
[12:29:26] <LindsayMac> hmm... its still not getting to the second $overlay animation
[12:29:45] <LindsayMac> well it is.. but on a HUGE delay...
[12:30:06] <gwinh_dev> I am setting a opacity in jquery but it doesn't work in IE...weird
[12:30:08] <LindsayMac> because it seems to be calculating over and over and over again, the height until it realized "Oh.. it doesn't matter, it needs to be x"
[12:30:59] <DarkSector> johnkpaul: okay :) that worked, I issued an alert but ui.draggable is an object. How do I get the particular div id?
[12:31:05] <ktstowell> you could try making $windowHeight a static number within reason to test if the Math calc is borking
[12:31:13] <johnkpaul> DarkSector: ui.draggable.id
[12:31:21] <DarkSector> ah! :) sweet
[12:31:24] <gwinh_dev> I am setting a opacity in jquery but it doesn't work in IE...weird
[12:31:47] <ktstowell> if you're using .css
[12:31:55] <gwinh_dev> I am using .css
[12:32:08] <ktstowell> jquery doesn't do any special processing in terms of cross browser compatibility
[12:32:16] <ktstowell> it takes actualy css values
[12:32:19] <ktstowell> and applies them inline
[12:32:23] <ktstowell> and dat be it
[12:32:34] <gwinh_dev> how do I leverage the problem?
[12:32:43] <ktstowell> so youll need to give IE8 it's native opacity
[12:32:51] <ktstowell> in ie it's called alpha
[12:33:48] <harpdarp> could someone help me out with jquery-ui not disposing of resources properly?
[12:33:59] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  im making a screencast so you can see
[12:34:26] <ktstowell> Im about to head into my team's sprint planning LindsayMac, so might responses will be slightly delayed, sorry
[12:34:35] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  no worries. its all good.
[12:34:36] <ktstowell> my* responses
[12:34:47] <ktstowell> but ill still have my laptop with me
[12:35:17] <LindsayMac> any help is appreciated. if it takes a moment, so be it
[12:35:22] <LindsayMac> uploading now
[12:36:00] <whoev> can i make it so jquery posts a file as one query, and somehow displays 'upload progress' to the user, while the server side has a normal upload handler than just sticks the contents of the parameter 'whatever' into a file?
[12:37:58] <DarkSector> johnkpaul: http://jsfiddle.net/G5CwQ/ What am I doing wrong here, if you don't mind, Why isn't the ID showing up?
[12:38:31] <johnkpaul> sorry DarkSector, I was wrong about it veing a regular dom element
[12:38:33] <johnkpaul> it's the jquery obj
[12:38:35] <LindsayMac> Ok ktstowell if you're around.. here's the weirdness happening https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/Public/aniamtionissue.swf?w=2f50679e
[12:38:39] <DarkSector> oh
[12:38:39] <johnkpaul> http://jsfiddle.net/johnkpaul/G5CwQ/1/
[12:38:44] <johnkpaul> ^ @ DarkSector
[12:38:50] <DarkSector> :) checking
[12:39:08] <DarkSector> johnkpaul: Ah thanks!
[12:39:24] <johnkpaul> DarkSector: no problem, have fun!
[12:39:38] <harpdarp> does anyone know how to get jquery-ui tabs to dispose of the page it loads completely (including all JS libs loaded in the tab)? it seems i'm having a problem where switching between tabs causes colorbox to initialize multiple times, and i don't think it's a colorbox issue. I have full details on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11834533/jquery-ui-tabs-not-disposing-of-resources
[12:40:05] <ktstowell> ok LindsayMac, im having to hook my screen to the projector for the team to look at so my respnses might be non existent for a while
[12:40:26] <LindsayMac> ok.. no probs. I just wanted to reference your name so you have the link.
[12:40:32] <LindsayMac> If you so choose to take a look later
[12:41:32] <LindsayMac> So if anyone else is around, I have this issue.. this is the basic code i am using http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/Etsze/46/
[12:42:05] <LindsayMac> What happens is, if you scroll around on the page manually, and then click the panel4 button it should snap it to the trigger point and then initiate the fade in and expansion of that white container
[12:42:31] <LindsayMac> what actually happens is the content fades in and the white box delays a lot before coming in .. for no real reason I can see
[12:56:58] <DarkSector> johnkpaul: Is there a way to stop the premature callback? http://jsfiddle.net/DarkSector/2Rcfc/4/
[12:57:13] <DarkSector> johnkpaul: I mean only once when you've left the div should the callback occur
[13:00:42] <draginx> ok is there a way to animate into a CSS rule?
[13:00:53] <motaka2> ktstowell: are you there ?
[13:02:52] <johnkpaul> draginx: what do you mean "left the div"?
[13:03:02] <johnkpaul> you don't want it to happen on drop?
[13:03:05] <motaka2> does anyone knows of a good link in which they teach how to make a very simple wysiwyg ?
[13:03:06] <draginx> johnkpaul: eh?
[13:03:09] <draginx> wrong guy?
[13:03:12] <johnkpaul> sorry , yes
[13:03:15] <johnkpaul> ^ @ DarkSector
[13:04:02] <DarkSector> johnkpaul: I mean till the draggable stops being dragged, then only the callback should occur
[13:05:00] <johnkpaul> DarkSector: that's what happens for me, it alerts when the mouseup happens
[13:05:00] <harpdarp> anyone have good knowledge of jquery-ui tabs?
[13:05:31] <DarkSector> johnkpaul: oh that's weird because the moment I am out of the div and I still have the mouse down it issues a call back
[13:06:21] <johnkpaul> DarkSector: that's because you have an out handler
[13:06:37] <johnkpaul> you have an alert when something drops and when something leaves
[13:06:41] <ktstowell> motaka2, and LindsayMac: I won't be able to dedicate any time to this screen for the next couple hours. pm here or dm me on twitter @ktstowell if ya need me to see something later.
[13:06:59] <DarkSector> johnkpaul: but isn't there a way to say check if they are still overlapping
[13:07:19] <DarkSector> and once they are not, then the callback should be issued
[13:09:20] <motaka2> does anyone knows of a good link in which they teach how to make a very simple wysiwy ?
[13:09:42] <johnkpaul> DarkSector: that is what out is for
[13:11:10] <LindsayMac> motaka2:  make or use?
[13:11:41] <motaka2> LindsayMac: make a very simple one so I can add things later on
[13:12:13] <lindsayo> wow, something really didn't like my slide attempt
[13:12:21] <lindsayo> TypeError: c.easing[this.options.specialEasing && this.options.specialEasing[this.prop] || b] is not a function
[13:12:24] <LindsayMac> motaka2:  i dont know... but seems like a large thing to tackle considering there are a bunch of expandabl great ones out there
[13:12:51] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  are you calling jquery and any nec. easing plugins?
[13:13:14] <motaka2> LindsayMac: I have my own concerns , but why google wikipedia stackflow etc ... all of them have their own ?
[13:13:46] <LindsayMac> do they?
[13:13:51] <lindsayo> LindsayMac: I dunno.
[13:13:58] <lindsayo> I'm calling jQuery using Drupal.behaviors
[13:14:04] <Know1edge> Anyone know how to animate backgroundPositionX on firefox (osx)
[13:14:07] <lindsayo> Maybe I'm missing the effects plugin?
[13:14:09] <Know1edge> works in all other browsers
[13:15:09] <motaka2> LindsayMac: Yes they do
[13:17:13] <LindsayMac> lindsayo: that is what it seems .. look in the head on your page to be sure its all there
[13:18:31] <lindsayo> thanks, LindsayMac
[13:28:21] <harpdarp> anyone have good knowledge of jquery-ui tabs?
[13:28:36] <snover> no, nobody has ever used jquery-ui tabs before
[13:28:57] <harpdarp> :(
[13:31:26] <harpdarp> i guess i'll go try out the jquery tools tabs, then :/
[13:32:35] <dabear> nobody has used that either
[13:33:14] <harpdarp> such a friendly community
[13:33:52] <astropirate> The friendliest
[13:33:55] <astropirate> of them all
[13:34:17] <astropirate> just don't walk into #c++ those guys are mean :(
[13:34:31] <Toerkeium> hello guys
[13:34:54] <Toerkeium> I there any way to get the ajax function which triggered $(document).ajaxStart() ?
[13:36:43] <astropirate> Theowning, you should rethink your approche
[13:36:51] <astropirate> approch*
[13:37:04] <astropirate> approach**
[13:40:49] <Toerkeium> nobody?
[13:59:32] <harpdarp> can someone help me with this tabs issue i'm having? http://jsfiddle.net/bDtXx/3/
[14:00:34] <harpdarp> i'm trying to figure out how to get jquery ui to dispose of all resources when a new tab is selected
[14:01:48] <harpdarp> i.e...when i dynamically load a page into a tab (which has colorbox), go to another tab and come back, it seems as though colorbox is initialized on the page twice
[14:02:33] <harpdarp> even though i'm using cache : false, it's not working
[14:02:37] <rickibalboa> this might be quite complex, but has anyone got any idea how i can find out how many elements are between two elements, say I have a 500 elements, li's let's say, and one at the top called #item100 and one at #item355, how could i find out how many are between them two, obviously 254
[14:02:55] <rickibalboa> well, not at the top, say they're in order
[14:03:45] <harpdarp> you could slice everything before and after the two elements and do a count on it
[14:04:57] <harpdarp> http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[14:05:34] <harpdarp> sorry, not count, length
[14:06:30] <harpdarp> does that help at all?
[14:07:39] <rickibalboa> okay great thanks
[14:09:01] <LindsayMac> trying to make a better test environment, but I can't seem to get scrollTo to work http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/Etsze/48/
[14:09:16] <LindsayMac> OMG NEVER MIND!
[14:10:03] <tw2113> ZOMG
[14:10:14] <tw2113> why did i type in caps
[14:10:15] <Jayflux> tw2113 OMG!
[14:10:30] <LindsayMac> Because... i inspired you
[14:10:52] <codepython777> Whats a good error handling framework for JQ. I make ajax calls to my server, as well as redirects from the server. When there is an exception on the server, ... how 'should' i handle it in JQ (when i do ajax / redirects from server)
[14:10:57] <LindsayMac> I can't get scrollTo to work here http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/Etsze/49/
[14:11:00] <tw2113> inspired to shout and yell by someone with two X chromosomes....that's about right
[14:11:05] <LindsayMac> :/
[14:11:17] <tw2113> i'm going to get smacked one of these days, over tcp/ip
[14:12:23] <motaka2> it is really funny that no one can help me here
[14:12:42] <motaka2> Common men!
[14:12:58] <harpdarp> me as well, i need a tabs expert!
[14:13:24] <LindsayMac> tabs are a pain in the buehind
[14:13:41] <LindsayMac> motaka2:  but you need to chill .. sometimes theres just no one around who can help
[14:14:00] <harpdarp> yeah, it's either jquery ui tabs or go back to the legacy bs tabs system we have
[14:14:14] <vigneshmoha> hello hi.. I want to display some images after its loaded. I found some script by google. http://pastebin.com/7aN2tgXN but its not working..
[14:14:21] <LindsayMac> thats the ONLY tabs in the world to use?
[14:14:35] <motaka2> LindsayMac:  I always thought I could find plenty of tuts teaching how to make a simple html editor but there is none
[14:14:36] <harpdarp> yeah, apparently the same issue arises with jquery tools tabs
[14:14:40] <LindsayMac> vigneshmoha:  you want something like lazy load?
[14:15:10] <LindsayMac> harpdarp:  there are a bunch of ways to make tabs..
[14:16:00] <enkomax> is firebug a good choice for js debugging? anything more extensive? (i am new to it)
[14:16:09] <LindsayMac> OK. i'm calling the ScrollTo plugin so why am I getting "ScrollTo" is not defined? http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/Etsze/50/
[14:16:21] <LindsayMac> enkomax:  it seems most people here actually use Chrome's
[14:16:42] <harpdarp> LindsayMac: i'm aware, but i'm having an issue with current jquery ui tabs...check out my SO post...http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11834533/jquery-ui-tabs-not-disposing-of-resources
[14:16:57] <vigneshmoha> LindsayMac : yea.. Thanks for that pluglin.. :)
[14:17:10] <LindsayMac> vigneshmoha:  that might be easier to implement..
[14:17:15] <enkomax> k i'll give it a shot
[14:17:19] <harpdarp> it's pretty simple, really, but i can't figure out why jquery ui is keeping old resources for colorbox...
[14:18:07] <vigneshmoha> LindsayMac: Just now i noticed it.. Good one.. really!! Thank ya
[14:18:24] <LindsayMac> vigneshmoha:  youre welcome
[14:22:35] <LindsayMac> I think i mght need someone with chrome timeline to tell me if my animations are being calling in the wrong order.. or tell me how to test that in firebug
[14:23:26] <LindsayMac> because it SEEMS as though maybe a smoothscrolling effect is making my other effects not initiate correctly.
[14:24:12] <Cam> If I am animating() an object how can I tell it to wait until it is done animating to continue executing the commande?
[14:24:52] <LindsayMac> i think there is a complete
[14:25:06] <LindsayMac> Cam: .animate( properties [, duration] [, easing] [, complete] )
[14:25:10] <LindsayMac> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[14:32:43] <scriptor> hi, is it possible for deferred.pipe() to take multiple arguments?
[14:33:17] <scriptor> wait, never mind
[14:44:24] <LindsayMac> Ahhh i really can NOT figure this out..
[14:45:35] <shoky> LindsayMac can i help?
[14:45:58] <Cam> $("#header").click(function(){$(this).animate({height:'300',width:"100%"}, 1000, $(this).append("<h1>SCOREBOARD</h1>"));})
[14:46:01] <Cam> That doesn't work for me.
[14:46:08] <LindsayMac> shoky:  so I started to rethink the way I was triggering my animations.. and I was going along just fine..
[14:46:56] <LindsayMac> I have bene entirely unable to replicate it in a fiddle... but
[14:47:40] <LindsayMac> basically I have this code:
[14:47:46] <LindsayMac> http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/dgu3c/
[14:48:16] <LindsayMac> with the same html layout.. the only thing different is that I have scrollTo called (which I stupidly can not seem how to call in jsfiddle).
[14:48:55] <LindsayMac> But what is happening on my site is that when I scroll to the container that I set as the selector to trigger the animation, i my white-box gets crazy and starts changing it's height for no reason from 21 to 21
[14:48:57] <LindsayMac> oops
[14:49:05] <LindsayMac> from 21 to 21.354546 , 23
[14:49:43] <LindsayMac> its like it will go through a ton of decimal numbers even though I did not tell it to change it's size until i get to the specified offset()top location
[14:50:22] <LindsayMac> I have a video if you want to see... or i can just video you access to the dev.
[14:50:34] <LindsayMac> I feel like my code is right on point.. it makes logical sense to me .
[14:52:16] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Etsze/51/
[14:52:34] <shoky> i just changed the scrollTo.js url (removed the ?ver=1.0.0 or whatever it was)
[14:53:03] <LindsayMac> Nlahh i had that exact code and I swear it wasn't working for me
[14:53:55] <LindsayMac> shoky:  but i think it now shows my issue well...
[14:54:10] <LindsayMac> basically that when you scroll to that area which previously should have triggered the event, it doesnt
[14:54:16] <shoky> yea i just wanted to fix that first
[14:54:34] <LindsayMac> shoky:  appreciated
[14:55:01] <LindsayMac> shoky:  it is a LOT more wonky on my test site though..
[14:55:05] <shoky> so, if ($currentY != $scrollY) {
[14:55:09] <LindsayMac> shoky: https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/Public/aniamtionissue.swf?w=2f50679e
[14:55:18] <shoky> that's true almost all the time during a scroll
[14:55:30] <LindsayMac> shoky:  yes.. you are right
[14:55:43] <shoky> what's the purpose of that if block?
[14:55:44] <LindsayMac> I didn't know how to say it differently in js
[14:55:53] <shoky> o
[14:56:02] <LindsayMac> shoky:  it actually slides down as a background image to the text which then displays over the top of it
[14:56:50] <LindsayMac> Woah.. i just left that fiddle sitting there for 60 seconds and all of a sudden it expanded that white box!
[14:57:06] <imsky> woah
[14:57:36] <shoky> you're queueing tons of animations
[14:57:42] <shoky> for each scroll event
[14:57:52] <shoky> tons of opacity:0 animations
[14:58:07] <LindsayMac> right i kinda of felt that was wonky so I started looking in to toggle..
[14:58:15] <LindsayMac> toggle on if it's true and off if it's not
[14:58:18] <shoky> hold on
[14:58:33] <LindsayMac> k
[14:59:02] <shoky> is panel 4 special?
[14:59:04] <LindsayMac> shoky:  if i am getting annoying, just tell me.. i always feel like i get SOO close and then BAM..
[14:59:21] <shoky> nah dont worry bout it
[14:59:37] <LindsayMac> shoky:  well no.. there are 9 panes in my design... 5 of them will need to trigger this effect and the rest will just keep that little box small
[14:59:40] <shoky> if you annoy me i'll just annoy you back ;P
[14:59:46] <LindsayMac> lol ok...
[15:00:09] <shoky> oks
[15:00:42] <LindsayMac> shoky:  strange.. the code as it is now, if i just leave the browser on #panel4 it just randomly opens and closes that whitebox
[15:11:27] <cloaked1> How does one create a proper deferred object from a chrome.extension.API call?  Wouldn't $.Deferred(chrome.extension.API({foo})) create a proper deferred object?
[15:11:52] <cloaked1> IE var deferred = $.Deferred(chrome.extension.API({foo}));
[15:13:01] <aniasis> He I am using $.ajax to loadf googlemaps but for some reason it isn't working
[15:13:18] <cloaked1> return(deferred) where then later in the code something like this pipe --   this.Method().pipe(function(bar) {...}) would work with the returned deferred ?
[15:13:28] <LindsayMac> aniasis:  you should define more carefully what "doesnt work" means
[15:15:30] <aniasis> LindsayMac, it just don't werk!
[15:16:19] <LindsayMac> aniasis:  that helps no one help you though... paste some code, get an error, post a link.. something
[15:18:33] <LindsayMac> shoky:  i am so stuck again on this one. I am THINKING I need to kill the scroll as soon as you hit it's location
[15:22:39] <LindsayMac> everything I read about offset is how to animate to an offset and now how to use it as a trigger to start something else
[15:26:59] <shoky> LindsayMac: i think this is an improvement http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Etsze/52/
[15:27:24] <shoky> using a simple boolean to figure out if we want to even queue another animation or not
[15:27:40] <shoky> and also using .stop(true) before any animation so we dont stack up animations on the queue
[15:28:03] <LindsayMac> shoky:  how does stop() act differently thant stop(true)
[15:28:04] <LindsayMac>  ?
[15:28:17] <shoky> and also i made the scrollTo only start _after_ the overlay is done unrolling (with the .promise() thing)
[15:28:48] <LindsayMac> Ohhh i havent read about .promise yet
[15:28:56] <shoky> LindsayMac: stop() stops the current animation. stop(true) does that and also clears the queue from any remaining queued up animations
[15:29:59] <LindsayMac> Ohhh .. i thought it did both...
[15:30:47] <tw2113> *runs away from the throbbing and growing braaaaaaaaaaaaaain
[15:31:25] <LindsayMac> shoky:  and why did you se $panel4 as a var ?
[15:32:37] <shoky> LindsayMac: i just started cleaning up a bit, didnt finish the job ;p
[15:32:55] <LindsayMac> Ahh ok
[15:33:00] <shoky> but i didn't want $('#panel4') to be running on every scroll event
[15:33:03] <LindsayMac> Just making sure.. i thought i missed something
[15:33:36] <LindsayMac> shoky:  this event is going to be sprinkled to a bunch of different panels throughout the page.
[15:35:09] <shoky> LindsayMac: that still doesn't mean that the individual panels should be searched for in the DOM on each scroll event
[15:35:17] <shoky> you only have 9
[15:35:19] <LindsayMac> point made.
[15:35:21] <LindsayMac> and taken
[15:35:51] <LindsayMac> and what does snap / inSpan do/
[15:35:56] <LindsayMac> inSpan*
[15:36:03] <LindsayMac> AHHHH dyslexic brain! ahhaha
[15:36:07] <LindsayMac> inSnap
[15:36:23] <shoky> well first i added snap, it's that range we were talking about
[15:36:38] <shoky> if (Math.abs($currentY - $scrollY) < snap)
[15:37:15] <LindsayMac> ohhh ok
[15:37:22] <shoky> checks if $currentY and $scrollY are up to 'snap' pixels apart from each other
[15:37:27] <LindsayMac> so its more flexible than to-the-pixel perfection
[15:38:15] <shoky> and then i only wanted the 'going from out of snap range into snap range' event to only happen once, same with the opposite
[15:38:23] <shoky> hence the inSnap boolean
[15:38:45] <LindsayMac> omg so much nicer/smoother
[15:39:25] <LindsayMac> thanks for explaining too.. i am pretty good at reading code and seeing how people did things, but its good to have the person who wrote it right here too!
[15:39:27] <shoky> even just taking your previous fiddle and adding .stop(true) before each .animate(..   made it behave much better
[15:39:54] <shoky> but i didnt like that both the scroll animation and the overlay animation are happening simultaneously
[15:40:04] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Etsze/52/
[15:40:24] <shoky> ^ now the scrollTo will wait for both the overaly and the panel's fade to finish before starting the scroll
[15:40:31] <LindsayMac> yea i added the stop() but not stop(true)
[15:40:32] <shoky> .promise() is nifty
[15:40:32] <b-ot> shoky, memorised “promise()”.
[15:40:42] <shoky> thanks b-ot
[15:40:46] <shoky> b-ot, thanks
[15:40:49] <shoky> fu
[15:40:51] <imsky> it's a bot
[15:40:56] <shoky> fu it!
[15:41:01] <imsky> u seem dumb
[15:41:05] <LindsayMac> what the helljust happened?
[15:41:06] <shoky> i no rite
[15:41:16] <shoky> i discovered AI
[15:41:37] <LindsayMac> it seems like the bot is sporatic here
[15:41:43] <shoky> that one is ;)
[15:41:50] <shoky> bot-t is alright when he's not afk
[15:42:11] <shoky> but they say b-ot is a work in progress
[15:42:47] <snover> b-ot: are you a work in progress?
[15:42:54] <LindsayMac> #wordpress has a sick bot.. it's awesome
[15:43:31] * tw2113 calls Doogie Howser for the WP bot
[15:45:24] <tw2113> ?eval 'LindsayMac' + ' is cray';
[15:45:41] <tw2113> boo @ bot
[15:45:45] <LindsayMac> :P
[15:45:52] <LindsayMac> i be cray cray
[15:49:28] <LindsayMac> i hate it when a band has one great songs and none of their others seem to stack up
[15:50:52] <tw2113> which band?
[15:51:58] <LindsayMac> Awolnation
[15:52:05] <tw2113> never heard of them
[15:52:12] <jaket> you mean
[15:52:16] <jaket> sail was their good song?>
[15:52:21] <LindsayMac> yea.
[15:52:35] <LindsayMac> im sure fans would think otherwise.. fans of their music.. but its a great song
[15:52:57] <joikus> any suggestions on building a passbook type look and feel via jquery/css?  http://www.apple.com/ca/ios/ios6/#passbook
[15:53:03] <tw2113> i kind of like the idea of a band becoming pretty famous through EPs and singles alone
[15:53:04] <tw2113> no LP
[15:53:18] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  i just sent you the song
[15:53:30] <tw2113> i just looked it up on youtube
[15:53:40] <jaket> not your fault is good
[15:53:46] <jaket> not as good compared to sail
[15:53:50] <jaket> but one of the better ones
[15:54:01] <LindsayMac> jaket:  yea i feel the same way
[15:54:11] <tw2113> i'm not even digging Sail much
[15:54:41] <jaket> they really seem to hit the epic chorues
[15:54:48] <jaket> baby im a little confussseed, its not your fault yeah
[15:55:04] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  it grows on you
[15:55:14] <tw2113> like fungus?
[15:55:16] <LindsayMac> shoky:  is there a benefit to using opactiy versus visibility?
[15:55:23] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  exactly ... and body hair
[15:55:40] <tw2113> opacity can have any value between 0 and 1, visibility is hidden or shown?
[15:56:12] <LindsayMac> ok so when you are just showing / hiding something using visibility would make sense
[15:56:23] <jaket> not if you want to animate it
[15:56:36] <LindsayMac> jaket:  you can animate in .css
[15:56:44] <LindsayMac>            $('#panel4').delay(2500).css('visibility','visible').hide().fadeIn('10000');
[15:57:32] <jaket> afaik you can't animated between visibility visible and hidden
[15:58:03] <LindsayMac> jaket:  that code was fading in the content...
[15:58:37] <jaket> .fadeIn changes opacity, doesn't it?
[15:59:09] <LindsayMac> jaket:  but i am still toggling between visibility
[15:59:40] <jaket> you can toggle
[15:59:42] <jaket> it's just redundant
[16:00:03] <LindsayMac> yea i guess you're right
[16:03:11] <LindsayMac> ok now time to refactor the rest of my containers to use this new code
[16:04:35] <brl0> refactoring containers should be an olympic event
[16:04:45] <LindsayMac> LOL
[16:07:33] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[16:07:44] <LindsayMac> evening :)
[16:14:03] <shoky> LindsayMac hold on before you do that ;P
[16:14:54] <LindsayMac> shoky:  Ohhh you got good timing!
[16:14:58] <LindsayMac> I was just getting in to it
[16:16:52] <shoky> LindsayMac: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Etsze/55/
[16:17:06] <shoky> now it's much more generic
[16:17:17] <shoky> there's a seperate inSnap for each panel
[16:17:23] <ogk1000> I'm trying to clear internal time on this very simple script, any ideas? http://collabedit.com/gnaed
[16:17:52] <LindsayMac> shoky:  awesome thanks!!!!
[16:18:03] <LindsayMac> I was looking at it trying to figure outhow to do exactly that
[16:18:04] <shoky> and it doesn't trigger the fade-in+overlay-show if you move past a panel while you're scrolling to a different one
[16:18:26] <shoky> (becuase i track it with that currentScrollTarget var)
[16:18:32] <shoky> yw LindsayMac
[16:18:44] <ogk1000> can someone peep my little script?
[16:18:59] <LindsayMac> shoky:  yea that is important to not trigger as you go past
[16:19:09] <shoky> LindsayMac: er and i just chose 'hehe' as the class for the trigger panels, but that should be someth a bit more descriptive ;)
[16:19:33] <LindsayMac> lol shoky like .killmenowthissitemightkillme
[16:19:41] <shoky> LindsayMac: in the fiddle, only panels 3,4,6 have class="hehe"
[16:19:43] <shoky> lawl
[16:19:56] <LindsayMac> shoky:  yea i see that... thanks
[16:21:21] <shoky> oh there's one prob
[16:21:30] <LindsayMac> oh no.. no no no ..
[16:23:18] <krz> any recommendations for html5 uploaders?
[16:24:21] <shoky> LindsayMac: ok fixed http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Etsze/56/
[16:24:21] <LindsayMac> krz:  i've done this tutorial
[16:24:21] <LindsayMac> http://tutorialzine.com/2011/09/html5-file-upload-jquery-php/
[16:24:31] <LindsayMac> shoky:  what was your fix?
[16:25:22] <shoky> LindsayMac: because i added the currentScrollTarget check, manual scrolls wouldn't trigger the fade-in. so i added an scrollTo-in-progress flag
[16:25:42] <shoky> to distinguish between scrollTo scrolls and manual scrolls
[16:25:45] <LindsayMac> Ahhh yes. I disabled manual scrolling HOWEVER some folks using safari and chrome said they can still scroll
[16:26:39] <imsky> i can always scroll
[16:26:45] <imsky> im a big scrolla
[16:27:46] <LindsayMac> AHHH this cloudflare thing is DRIVING ME INSANE during dev
[16:29:18] <LindsayMac> brb. Dinner is here
[16:29:26] <LindsayMac> shoky:  if you bounce, THANK YOU
[17:00:11] <LindsayMac> Full stomach clear head.. time to get to it!
[17:00:56] <imsky> SO PUMPED
[17:02:39] <LindsayMac> imsky:  glad to know my full stomach gets you pumped!
[17:02:49] <imsky> don't get your stomach pumped
[17:02:56] <imsky> i heard a lady got gastroenteritis doing that
[17:04:01] <coldhead> GASTROENTERITIS is correct. Thanks spell check!
[17:04:02] <LindsayMac> I dont even know what that is...
[17:04:12] <LindsayMac> lol
[17:04:31] <coldhead> better not to need to know
[17:04:38] <coldhead> let them explain in the emergency room
[17:04:40] <LindsayMac> okee dokee...
[17:04:49] * LindsayMac buries head in pages of code 
[17:05:37] <ktstowell> Careful, you may never come out.
[17:07:37] <LindsayMac> its not a k=hole.. its a code-hole
[17:07:55] <ktstowell> Ha
[17:09:00] <LindsayMac> ok.. i NEED to finish this silly thing.
[17:09:12] <imsky> it's like 8 pm in connecticut
[17:09:18] <LindsayMac> I've already made this animation 3 completely different ways.. I think this is going to be the most efficient
[17:09:20] <ktstowell> Still working on the animation?
[17:09:21] <LindsayMac> imsky:  yes it is
[17:09:25] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  hahah yup
[17:09:30] <ktstowell> :)
[17:09:40] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  when its live, i'll happily share whats done!
[17:09:46] <ktstowell> Woot
[17:09:49] <imsky> youre making animation efficient?
[17:09:54] <imsky> hope it's for a game!
[17:09:57] <LindsayMac> pretty psyched, but this time my design went over my head when code..
[17:10:00] <abletony84> yo.. trying to do this text-only facebook like thingie.. anybody know a way to make it work though? http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/fwXwC/3/ .. the text-only share link works fine though
[17:10:02] <LindsayMac> no..
[17:11:06] <imsky> abletony84, what isn't working
[17:11:07] <LindsayMac> imsky:  its a whole big thing.. but basically its one of those sites that can be a little more "flashy" than hyper-function..
[17:11:21] <imsky> sounds like an awesome way to spend a monday evening
[17:11:32] <imsky> optimizing some animation maaan
[17:11:37] <LindsayMac> doood
[17:12:19] <ktstowell> lawl
[17:13:02] <abletony84> imsky: the like link
[17:13:08] <imsky> what about it abletony84
[17:13:13] <imsky> the popup opens for me
[17:13:17] <ktstowell> opens for me too
[17:13:31] <abletony84> dont you get this "cant find url" message?
[17:13:45] <imsky> yes
[17:13:54] <LindsayMac> abletony84:  uea it pops up the modal but doesnt get the content right
[17:14:27] <abletony84> yup, not sure what to do
[17:14:33] <imsky> use the real like button
[17:14:50] <abletony84> cats are saying "make your own like system" but nah i need it to go through facebook for the viral marketing or what not
[17:15:00] <abletony84> imsky: cant do it, doesnt feel right
[17:15:18] <imsky> life's hard in the yard
[17:15:24] <abletony84> lol
[17:15:29] <abletony84> yeah :-)
[17:18:04] <LindsayMac> wrestling this code into submission is NOT an easy task
[17:19:39] <abletony84> shit, i hear that
[17:19:52] <imsky> abletony84, http://jsfiddle.net/imsky/fwXwC/5/
[17:20:01] <ktstowell> Is it in a pool of jello? or Chocolate?
[17:20:29] <imsky> BOTH ARE NOW SHARE LINKS

[17:22:43] <LindsayMac> haha
[17:22:45] <LindsayMac> yourself..
[17:22:51] <imsky> abletony84, lol i know you're mad about not having a like button, but they force you to use theirs, sorry bro
[17:23:05] <imsky> only way you could get around it is to spoof all their security shit
[17:23:46] <abletony84> ill do it man, ill really do it
[17:23:58] <imsky> how about if you do it
[17:24:12] <imsky> then i'll change my nick to abletony84 for a week
[17:24:32] <ktstowell> really digging http://codepen.io
[17:24:37] <imsky> i'm not
[17:24:39] <abletony84> haha okay
[17:24:44] <imsky> can't do multiple js source ktstowell
[17:24:53] <ktstowell> it is definitely
[17:24:57] <imsky> what
[17:24:58] <abletony84> i usually let guys do it for $100/week due to all the pussy it gets them
[17:24:58] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  that site makes me feel so inadequate
[17:25:00] <ktstowell> not for the js expert
[17:25:13] <imsky> abletony84, i'll do it at no charge to you
[17:25:15] <ktstowell> it has css bias all up in it
[17:25:51] <LindsayMac> woah this conversation went in a whole otehr direction
[17:26:03] <ktstowell> but yes - imsky i had to abridge/append code to get it to work there
[17:26:12] <imsky> lol or you could have used jsfiddle
[17:26:21] <imsky> NO CODEPEN IS THE NEW HIP PLACE NO I REFUSE
[17:26:22] <ktstowell> but clearly defining the  source
[17:26:27] <ktstowell> yeah
[17:26:29] <ktstowell> was shiny and new
[17:26:34] <ktstowell> so i wanted to make one
[17:26:43] <imsky> u seem attracted to shiny things
[17:26:48] <ktstowell> and now i feel like a hipster
[17:26:52] <imsky> would u like to buy iphone 4s 32gb? only $399
[17:26:59] <ktstowell> lol
[17:26:59] <LindsayMac> if people weren't attracted to shiny things, us designers would have no real jobs
[17:27:06] <imsky> no, you wouldn't have a real job
[17:27:10] <ktstowell> well
[17:27:11] <imsky> i'd still be raking it in
[17:27:12] <LindsayMac> I'll sell ya a 4 for $200...
[17:27:14] <ktstowell> im not much of a designer
[17:27:21] <ktstowell> my right brain doesn't do a whole lot
[17:27:34] <imsky> kick it in its balls
[17:27:35] <ktstowell> except for identify shiny things
[17:27:35] <LindsayMac> I've been pretty well blessed...
[17:27:53] <imsky> yeah lol
[17:28:00] <imsky> DOING THIS JQUERY ANIMATION LATE AT NIGHT
[17:28:00] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  thats better than some!! There's some devs. i met who couldnt see a good design if it smacked them in the face with a fish
[17:28:01] <ktstowell> well
[17:28:10] <LindsayMac> imsky:  yea but I can code the shit out of php / wordpress
[17:28:15] <imsky> lol
[17:28:20] <ktstowell> females inherently have some higher right brain activity i think
[17:28:25] <imsky> you and me should touch base in a couple years
[17:28:33] <LindsayMac> and i can LEARN js.. i know designers who dont even know how the web really works..
[17:28:34] <ktstowell> haha
[17:28:39] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  well said ;)
[17:28:43] <imsky> no lol they don't
[17:28:45] <ktstowell> shit! go time! see yall tomorrow!

[17:32:20] <LindsayMac> what makes you think that is my age
[17:32:41] <imsky> experience

[17:38:11] <LindsayMac> no. it totally is the arrogant years.. they're AWESOME..
[17:38:25] <imsky> yeah then you turn 30 and you're optimizing animation on a monday night
[17:38:27] <tw2113> don't count on social security, youth
[17:38:39] <LindsayMac> imsky:  i was doing the same thing on a sat. and a sun night too
[17:38:46] <LindsayMac> AND my birthday night...
[17:38:54] <LindsayMac> so yea. My life is sad, but its not because i'm 30

[17:39:15] <imsky> get your game up
[17:39:57] <imsky> part of that involves closing the text editor at 8 PM
[17:40:13] <LindsayMac> imsky:  i code other languages... just because someone is just learning a new language doesnt mean they are behind in their knowledge of the web... theres a load of languages out there to learn adn know
[17:40:19] <tw2113> 20somethings in #jquery are futzing around when there's no party to go to, 30 year olds in #jquery are running a business
[17:40:26] <imsky> lol no

[17:40:36] <imsky> u run the biggest loser
[17:40:40] <LindsayMac> not to mention, there was no real coding to speak of when I was in highschool... i mean, there was basic websites.. but no one was a web designer
[17:41:02] <tw2113> they were webmasters
[17:41:08] <imsky> LindsayMac, when did you start?
[17:41:15] <imsky> web i mean
[17:41:21] <tw2113> she invented it
[17:41:28] <tw2113> Tim Berners-Lee stole the fame
[17:41:28] <imsky> lol kissass
[17:41:31] <LindsayMac> Well I made my very first website when I was 15 using FrontPage ..
[17:41:50] <imsky> no what year did you start professionally
[17:41:55] <imsky> year of our lord
[17:42:04] <LindsayMac> but professionally, I started about 6 years ago, and 2 years leading up to that I did coding but not professionally
[17:42:06] <tw2113> i remember at first i thought frontpage was godsend
[17:42:13] <tw2113> but then i got smart
[17:42:19] <imsky> and went on the biggest loser
[17:42:21] * tw2113 recalls angelfire
[17:42:21] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  LOL ... frontpage was the worst thing ever
[17:42:27] <LindsayMac> geocities
[17:42:30] <LindsayMac> tripod
[17:42:59] * tw2113 applies more chapstick
[17:43:08] <imsky> buffalo bill?
[17:43:20] <imsky> LindsayMac, you said you're learning a new language, what do you know besides web tech?
[17:43:36] <LindsayMac> What do you mean?
[17:43:45] <imsky> "i code other languages"
[17:43:54] <imsky> just curious what they are
[17:43:56] <LindsayMac> I code web languages...
[17:44:01] <imsky> lolwat
[17:44:16] <tw2113> i code well good
[17:44:27] <LindsayMac> what's your deal ? you're getting to be an asshat right now
[17:44:28] <imsky> it puts the lotion in the basket, right tw2113 ?
[17:44:36] <tw2113> dunno, don't buy any
[17:44:40] <imsky> LindsayMac, i think that's the least assholy question i asked yet lol
[17:44:53] <LindsayMac> its a cumulative conclusion
[17:45:20] <imsky> ok
[17:45:36] <LindsayMac> I can code for php, mysql, some django, and flex apps with actionscript
[17:45:47] <imsky> lol so why are you doing low-rent shit like jquery animation
[17:45:49] <LindsayMac> I've done SOME javascript but not much until recently
[17:46:00] <imsky> flex and django puts you in the $90-$120K bracket
[17:46:01] <LindsayMac> imsky:  clearly you have no idea what you're talking about..
[17:46:02] <tw2113> because she wants to?
[17:46:11] <imsky> lol @ "clearly u dumb"
[17:46:14] <LindsayMac> and imsky?
[17:46:56] * imsky dre fell off, how nigga my last album was the chronic
[17:47:10] <LindsayMac> imsky:  so because I chose to go in depth with JS last it makes me what.. less of a coder than you?  yea ok.
[17:47:15] <imsky> lol no
[17:47:20] <imsky> flex/django are killer skills
[17:47:24] <imsky> why did you switch
[17:47:44] <tw2113> who said she switched?
[17:47:50] <tw2113> she's concatenating skills
[17:47:51] <imsky> what are you, her attorney
[17:47:51] <LindsayMac> imsky:  i dont know a LOT of django, and I didn't switch, I just added more to my arsenal
[17:48:05] <imsky> you know im not kidding about 90-120k right
[17:48:23] <LindsayMac> imsky:  I know what my skills are worth..

[17:48:39] <imsky> coldhead u so sappy
[17:48:42] <tw2113> colbol is worth $$$ too
[17:48:45] <imsky> yeap
[17:49:00] <imsky> lol theres something fishy about
[17:49:02] <coldhead> but at what cost to your soul
[17:49:14] <imsky> "i know this framework that's hot with startups but now i'm learning jquery for some reason"
[17:49:22] <LindsayMac> imsky:  LOL...
[17:49:28] <LindsayMac> stupidest thing i've read today..
[17:49:34] <imsky> u mad
[17:49:54] <LindsayMac> No but it's amazing to me that you can't wrap your head around someone adding to their skill set..
[17:50:01] <tw2113> it's not about going after what will theoretically make you the most money
[17:50:05] <imsky> i can def wrap my head around it
[17:50:09] <imsky> just don't get why now
[17:50:12] <LindsayMac> clearly you cant...
[17:50:18] <imsky> lol at you
[17:50:34] <tw2113> it's about doing what you enjoy and what has a strong enough work market to survive
[17:50:40] <imsky> uh huh
[17:50:52] <imsky> you're like a platitude generator tw2113
[17:51:01] <tw2113> and you're a walking colon with a mouth
[17:51:15] <imsky> lol hi five brotha
[17:51:16] <imsky> sick burn
[17:51:49] <tw2113> why are you in jQuery if flex/django are so hot for startups?
[17:51:57] <LindsayMac> lol right?!
[17:52:05] <imsky> u seem dumb
[17:52:11] <LindsayMac> why are you wasting your time.. since you value flex/django so much... why cant you learn it ?
[17:52:25] <tw2113> i r st00pid
[17:52:37] <imsky> person A: knows flex, knows django, knows php. person A has $120K+ lined up. person A decides to learn new technology for some reason instead of cashing in on hot skills right now
[17:52:53] <LindsayMac> LMAO!!!
[17:52:57] <tw2113> because they don't want to?
[17:53:03] <imsky> ok tw2113 fair point
[17:53:07] <LindsayMac> That is the funniest shit yet! imsky you keep outdoing yourself.
[17:53:10] <imsky> then why did person A learn flex and django?
[17:53:11] <tw2113> and admit not having the skills to go after those "hot" jobs
[17:53:15] <imsky> OH
[17:53:21] <imsky> so person A sucks at django, i didn't know that
[17:53:25] <LindsayMac> imsky:  god forbid you use ALL of them
[17:53:33] <tw2113> she said she knows SOME
[17:53:39] <imsky> lol i don't know anybody who is a pro at flex, at django, at php, and at js
[17:53:44] <imsky> that's a AAA developer
[17:53:50] <imsky> you'd want them at any agency
[17:54:00] <tw2113> and you'll be searching for awhile
[17:54:01] <LindsayMac> thats so sad
[17:54:14] <LindsayMac> you keep going on with your one language at ta time..
[17:54:20] <imsky> lol at you
[17:54:22] <LindsayMac> good for you. You get GREAT at javascript..
[17:54:33] <flatiron> fuck, i'm stupid
[17:54:36] <LindsayMac> So why don't YOU learn php or flex or django?
[17:54:48] <tw2113> only things I care to learn/evolve on right now: html/css/js/php
[17:54:50] <imsky> because i already know php, flex is too enterprisey, and i dont want to learn python
[17:54:57] <imsky> YOU GOT ME
[17:55:01] <LindsayMac> hahaha... its too enterprisy
[17:55:26] <LindsayMac> whatever. I'm done with this useless conversation
[17:55:36] <imsky> you're the one that got mad
[17:55:48] <LindsayMac> imsky:  because you're the one that got douchy
[17:55:54] <imsky> no such thing
[17:56:01] <imsky> ever heard the phrase, jack of all trades?
[17:56:04] <imsky> i think i solved your riddle
[17:56:14] <tw2113> they're rare
[17:56:19] <Randomachiever> imsky you dont want to learn, your a ack of some trades
[17:56:27] <imsky> lol who the fuck are you
[17:56:34] <Randomachiever> <imsky> because i already know php, flex is too enterprisey, and i dont want to learn python
[17:56:37] <imsky> HERE COMES SOME RANDOM DUDE
[17:56:45] <LindsayMac> imsky:  its so funny that you really can't understand that someone learn multiple  languages just to learn them
[17:56:46] <Randomachiever> a random.... achiever
[17:56:51] <imsky> nice 1
[17:57:12] <Randomachiever> imsky, I thought I could only code in PHP and rule the world, I was wrong.. oh so very wrong
[17:57:24] <imsky> cool story bro
[17:57:25] <LindsayMac> someones you learn a language sothat when you work on a collaborative project you can provide input. Sometimes its so you can do little things for clients without having to outsource.. there's a million reasons
[17:57:39] <Randomachiever> imsky, Codecadaemy will teach you python, painlessly seeinf how you know php
[17:57:46] <imsky> lol i dont want to
[17:57:53] <imsky> i wrote enough python to know i dont want to
[17:57:56] <Randomachiever> Then you are a self defeating person
[17:57:59] <imsky> no u
[17:58:00] <LindsayMac> Randomachiever:  He thinks learning additional langauges is for idiots
[17:58:04] <imsky> nope
[17:58:04] <Randomachiever> You are holding yourself back
[17:58:21] <imsky> abjorn, lol
[17:58:26] <Randomachiever> LindsayMac, I hope he listens
[17:58:34] <LindsayMac> meh..
[17:58:45] <LindsayMac> don't really care either way.
[17:59:35] <Randomachiever> Learning new things, never bad. Learn enough different languages will allow you to learn other very quickly.
[17:59:58] <imsky> i like how u guise are flipping out over "U SHOULD LEARN MOAR LANGUAGES"
[18:00:17] <tw2113> should? debatable
[18:00:22] <tw2113> want to? obvious
[18:00:31] <imsky> lol at some point
[18:00:37] <imsky> there's too many languages
[18:00:39] <Randomachiever> No, just dont want your message to take hold on anyone trying to learn. People who are getting frustrated with it and want to give up
[18:00:52] <imsky> OH GOD WE CANT HAVE ANYONE BEING INFLUENCED BY IMSKY
[18:01:04] <imsky> lol go back into the woodwork
[18:01:07] <tw2113> do you have a point of being in here?
[18:01:14] <imsky> yeah i help people all the time
[18:01:16] <imsky> do u bro
[18:01:19] <tw2113> with what?
[18:01:25] <tw2113> jumping off the building?
[18:01:37] <imsky> lol at ur weak troll
[18:01:55] <tw2113> it wasn't trolling
[18:01:56] <Randomachiever> imsky, you're message is wrong. Im a chemisty teacher, but dont use and acids! NEVER! They are bad, there's too many to learn
[18:01:57] <tw2113> it was gnoming
[18:02:03] <imsky> Randomachiever, "you're"
[18:02:13] <imsky> lowachiever
[18:02:20] <imsky> wait underachiever
[18:02:23] <imsky> subachiever?
[18:02:23] <tw2113> he's a scientist, not english eacher
[18:02:26] <imsky> infraachiever
[18:02:27] <Randomachiever> your*
[18:02:37] <Randomachiever> imsky <3
[18:02:50] <imsky> lol you only spoke up once something enraged you
[18:03:05] <Randomachiever> If people look to you as a teacher, try to have the demeanor of one
[18:03:20] <imsky> "imsky you dont want to learn, your a ack of some trades"

[18:10:50] <imsky> soon as you put on some doctor dre, they all shut up
[18:33:57] <Godslastering> before every request i need to make a call to the server to get a token, and this token then needs to be injected into the request (either as get or post data, depending on the request type). I know i can do something like specify the beforeSend, but then how do i edit the data, and if the get_token function is async, how would that work?
[18:35:02] <imsky> ok sit down
[18:35:03] <abjorn> imsky: yo!
[18:35:12] <imsky> abjorn baby

[18:38:43] <abjorn> idk, they're looking for frontend engineers or whatever for a lot of different things
[18:38:47] <abjorn> apparently they're really in need
[18:38:52] <abjorn> so there's demand all over
[18:39:01] <imsky> yeah googles design sucks
[18:39:05] <imsky> so youll be good to go
[18:39:14] <abjorn> lol
[18:39:29] <imsky> what did she tell you to study
[18:39:36] <abjorn> ill paste to you
[18:39:37] <scarlet_razor> can someone help me what's wrong with my jquery script ?
[18:39:38] <imsky> kk
[18:39:40] <imsky> NO
[18:39:44] <imsky> GO LEARN YOUR OWN THING
[18:39:49] <scarlet_razor> http://jsfiddle.net/L8mSm/
[18:39:54] <imsky> what did i just say
[18:40:11] <scarlet_razor> i stuck in elseif statement that's not return the right thing
[18:42:28] <Nicolas_Leonida2> hi, in my example this.ul is a ul with li's as children, I wanna get rid of the ul itself and only keep all the lis
[18:42:33] <Godslastering> how can i change the data of a jqXHR object? i.e. the get/post data
[18:43:11] <Nicolas_Leonida2>         $(this.el).html($(this.el).children().html()); works, but it only keeps the first li
[18:48:15] <scarlet_razor> hello people ?
[18:59:37] <shoky> Nicolas_Leonida2: $(this.el).replaceWith( $(this.el).children() )
[19:00:25] <Nicolas_Leonida2> shoky: you're da man
[19:04:52] <boyo> Can anyone help me setup the jQuery-File-Upload plugin (https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload)?
[19:05:02] <boyo> Here is what I have so far, but it is not working for me: http://jsfiddle.net/4b254/
[19:05:18] <boyo> The submit button does not upload any files
[19:07:55] <shoky> boyo: you included the external .js in the wrong order. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/4b254/1/
[19:08:43] <scarlet_razor> i believe that my script is just a kiddes plaything...
[19:08:43] <scarlet_razor> can anyone willing to guide me.. heee
[19:09:05] <boyo> shoky: Thanks.  I was wondering why it wasn't working on jsfiddle
[19:09:31] <boyo> That's the same results I get.  The add handler seems to work, but the files are not passed to the server.
[19:09:43] <boyo> The photo param is blank on submit
[19:16:43] <shoky> boyo: if you put data.submit()  in the add callback (or if you remove the add callback) it'll submit files as you add them
[19:17:21] <boyo> shoky: Right, but I'm trying to implement an upload button, as provided by the example UI.
[19:19:41] <boyo> shoky: I could accumulate all the data.submit functions in an array, I suppose.  That seems hackish though.
[19:20:17] <boyo> shoky: I believe that an "Upload" button is a feature of this plugin, but I don't understand how to implement it.
[19:20:27] <shoky> boyo: try using data-url instead of action attribute on the form
[19:21:24] <shoky> hm nevermind sorry
[19:27:31] <boyo> Well, are there any other decent file upload plugins?  I'd prefer to use one that lets me build the interface for it.
[19:36:32] <shoky> boyo: I donno, but here's a simple clean way to do it using deferreds. but still there'll be one request for every selection
[19:36:38] <shoky> boyo: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/4b254/3/
[19:38:14] <shoky> boyo: sorry that doesnt work :P
[19:38:24] <shoky> coulda swore it just did :\
[19:39:14] <shoky> actually i think it works, but the done callbacks arent all getting called
[19:39:53] <boyo> shoky: Uploading files seems to be much harder than it needs to be  :-/
[19:40:23] <shoky> agreed. html5 should fix that, i think
[20:32:03] <coldhead> push me away on your lucky lucky day
[20:40:18] <batdorf> anyone here a master of touch functionality?
[20:41:37] <shoky> coldhead touches himself on an hourly basis
[20:41:47] <tw2113> among others
[20:42:57] <batdorf> I want to do something on touchstart, touchmove, and touchend, but I don't want to prevent the default actions (i.e. the scrolling on touchmove). If I don't preventDefault() my functions don't work
[20:43:11] <batdorf> do i need to write out the scrolling functionality?
[20:43:29] <batdorf> shoky: don't you ever sleep?
[20:43:36] <shoky> i'm just about to
[20:45:10] <batdorf> Where are you?
[20:45:31] <shoky> israel. but that's irrelevant, it's almost 7am ;)
[20:46:34] <batdorf> the time was relevant ;-) I want to visit tel aviv someday
[20:47:25] <batdorf> So no clue how to solve my problem and save me hours of coding?
[20:47:50] <shoky> nah i've never even held a smartphone for over a minute
[20:48:13] <coldhead> try turning it upside down and shaking it
[20:48:24] <coldhead> wait that's etch-a-sketch
[20:48:32] <coldhead> i'm sorry i am not allowed to do mobile stuff
[20:48:44] <coldhead> we have expensive mobile consultants in to do that
[20:48:48] <batdorf> a friend of mine took a funny photo in Isreal recently, want to see it?
[20:48:59] <shoky> heh. sure

[20:53:41] <oojacoboo> that's an assault riffle
[20:53:55] <shoky> uhm she's a soldier without her uniform on, i suppose
[20:54:03] <oojacoboo> mmm
[20:54:13] <shoky> i had a gun too
[20:54:19] <shoky> no bikini tho
[20:54:26] <oojacoboo> the military would allow weapons off base with someone out of uniform?
[20:54:48] <shoky> she's probably pushing it with the clothing :P
[20:55:17] <oojacoboo> doesn't sound like a pleasant place to visit
[20:55:29] <oojacoboo> and this is coming from someone who's uncle owns an armory
[20:55:53] <shoky> right.. cause this totally defines what it's like in israel
[20:56:03] <shoky> anyways, goodnight
[20:56:07] <oojacoboo> well, I don't know, but I don't think you'd ever see that in the states ;)

[21:32:38] <__null> and just have it show / hide?
[21:32:47] <acidjazz> hover animation is cool for like 5 seconds
[21:32:48] <acidjazz> then annoying
[21:32:56] <acidjazz> yea
[21:32:59] <__null> right, but it still has the same problem doing that
[21:33:05] <acidjazz> what problem
[21:33:19] <__null> move your mouse around the menu for a few seconds
[21:33:21] <acidjazz> yea
[21:33:22] <acidjazz> so
[21:33:22] <__null> from item to item
[21:33:26] <acidjazz> instead of binding to hover and blur
[21:33:29] <acidjazz> which i assume you are?
[21:33:42] <__null> yes
[21:33:52] <acidjazz> instead try an interator that checks the hover or blur state
[21:33:54] <acidjazz> i did it here
[21:33:56] <acidjazz> www.bravoyourcity.com
[21:33:59] <acidjazz> hover over serach
[21:34:08] <acidjazz> lots of times the hover/blur will miss the enter/exit
[21:34:09] <__null> ah okay
[21:34:11] <__null> that makes sense
[21:34:14] <acidjazz> and thats when it gets wackey
[21:34:17] <acidjazz> so like..
[21:34:39] <Crimlo> acid stop showing you prick
[21:34:48] <Crimlo> off**
[21:35:17] <acidjazz> use like .is(':hover')

[21:35:45] <fatmandown> i'm taking a date from an input box (string) and trying to use getDay() on it- how do I convert that string to a Date object? parseDate()? (i'm using the datepicker)
[21:36:45] <acidjazz> fatmandown: you need a compatible string w/ Date.parse();
[21:36:54] <acidjazz> then you can new Date(string);
[21:37:06] <acidjazz> fatmandown: your options are here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference%2FGlobal_Objects%2FDate%2Fparse
[21:37:56] <__null> thanks acidjazz, I got it
[21:38:27] <acidjazz> __null: man that unicode char looks 100% different in ff vs chrome
[21:38:35] <acidjazz> i wonder why..
[21:40:36] <Crimlo> they say i am a troll, i say "hell no!"... i am a "super troll pimp-o-matic motherfuc***"
[21:41:20] <fatmandown> acidjazz: many thanks, was struggling with that for a moment.
[21:41:35] <Crimlo> hey fatman
[21:42:28] <acidjazz> fatmandown: the sweetest is to get the timzone/etc all in there so the date object can represent things in their timezone w/out you careing about that server-side
[21:43:30] <Crimlo> he left
[21:43:50] <Crimlo> just you and i acid
[21:45:59] <Crimlo> hey acid
[21:46:03] <acidjazz> sup
[21:46:13] <Crimlo> what r u doing
[21:46:55] <acidjazz> trying to figure out what to do about this damn unicode character
[21:46:58] <acidjazz> http://codepen.io/hellozachwolf/full/closebtn/
[21:47:04] <acidjazz> shit looks diff in ff and chrome
[21:47:07] <acidjazz> was hoping to use it
[21:49:04] <Crimlo> different how?
[21:49:11] <acidjazz> the 'x'
[21:49:23] <acidjazz> now im trying http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_sign
[21:50:19] <Crimlo> why even bother, its a button.. use an image
[21:51:42] <Crimlo> the crazy part is, you already are
[21:51:52] <Crimlo> lord some people!
[21:52:15] <acidjazz> thats not sweet enough
[21:52:17] <acidjazz> thats only 99% sweet
[21:52:44] <Crimlo> well i understand... i like doing this my way also
[21:52:57] <tw2113> looks the same to me
[21:53:17] <Crimlo> dont worry about him, he's on drugs
[21:53:31] <tw2113> maybe the X is slightly higher in chrome
[21:53:37] <Crimlo> duh
[21:53:43] <Crimlo> its still a X
[21:53:56] <tw2113> that's the only issue i see at least :D
[21:53:58] <Crimlo> like i say... "not to worry"
[21:54:31] <Crimlo> have anyone ever tried molify?
[21:55:15] <acidjazz> tw2113: what OS are u in
[21:55:21] <oojacoboo> can you do something like… var serializedArrayOfElements = $("ul#foo li span").text().serialize();
[21:55:55] <tw2113> fedora 15
[21:55:57] <oojacoboo> or would I need to select them and loop over adding them to an array?
[21:56:23] <oojacoboo> serializing as I add to an array or a custom serialized string rather
[21:57:07] <Crimlo> d:)  dude relax
[21:58:49] <acidjazz> tw2113: 215 seems to be workingt better
[22:51:46] <EvilEpoch> Warm Greetings to all, I am The EvilEpoch.
[22:58:13] <astropirate> Hi EvilEpoch
[22:59:12] <EvilEpoch> astropirate: The EvilEpoch has difficulty understanding the criteria for the jquery slide effect. Sometimes he uses it and it works fine, other times the element just "appears" without sliding.
[22:59:22] <EvilEpoch> Perhaps you can help shed some light.
[22:59:37] <astropirate> I would but i'm a bit busy right now :(
[23:00:02] <EvilEpoch> No problem
[23:11:52] <Nacho> I need to borrow a jquery dev for 2 hours, who  is available?
[23:13:15] <Nacho> I need an expert
[23:13:40] <tw2113> and yet you're stuck with us
[23:15:11] * tw2113 is not taking PMs at the moment, ask your questions in the main room please.
[23:24:04] <lijzz> GM
[23:24:32] <Cork> tw2113: /mode tw2113 +g is a simple solution :)
[23:25:20] <lijzz> Cork i have a function getting called from change event where i am not passing any paramter to function but in some button click i am calling the same function where i am passing some value
[23:25:50] <lijzz> Cork, how do i distinguish whether it is an event or a parameter
[23:26:09] <Cork> you could check if the first parameter is an event
[23:26:26] <lijzz> how do i check
[23:26:28] <Cork> arguments[0].constructor === Event
[23:26:42] <Cork> i think... let me dubble check that :)
[23:27:13] <tw2113> i don't want to ban everyone, i use PMs for casual chatter when i can
[23:27:16] <lijzz> function like this function getModels(pl) {}
[23:27:46] <lijzz> Cork, i want to check whether p is an event or a parameter
[23:28:02] <lijzz> i mean p1
[23:30:36] <Cork> hmm no that didn't work...
[23:31:02] <lijzz> thats wat
[23:31:44] <lijzz> when i put function getModels(pl) {  if (pl == "0"){}} it gives me error when i call the same from change() of select
[23:35:18] <Cork> lijzz: it became much more jquery specific than i first wanted it to be, but this works http://jsfiddle.net/5wdZA/
[23:36:13] <lijzz> Cork cool
[23:36:17] <lijzz> Let me check this
[23:39:40] <DarkSector> How can I access an array defined in a script anywhere else on the page?
[23:40:10] <DarkSector> I am trying to pass XHR and I need the two arrays defined in the beginning of the page to be passed as arguments
[23:42:39] <Cork> DarkSector: javascript doesn't have the concept of files
[23:43:06] <Cork> if your array variable is defined globaly, you can just access them, if not, you need to provide a reference for your xhr to access it
[23:43:16] <Cork> where in the file/what file doens't matter
[23:43:23] <Cork> *doesn't
[23:43:38] <DarkSector> Cork: okay, so how do I access it anywhere else on the page? do I do this? $.arrayname ?
[23:44:44] <Cork> ex. window.my_global_accessable_config = { arr: [1,2,3,4] }; window.my_global_accessable_config.arr[2]
[23:44:44] <DarkSector> Cork: doing that I am able to send null only
[23:45:02] <Cork> DarkSector: you shoulnd't add data to $
[23:45:17] <Cork> window is the global scope
[23:45:37] <Cork> so if you add a property to it, it will be accessable from all over the page
[23:47:11] <DarkSector> Cork: http://pastie.org/private/bsxc31fdcf2tqza4quqsgg This is my code, please ignore the python stuff. Kindly take a look at line 80 and lines 12 to 37
[23:47:28] <DarkSector> Cork: I wish to send across the values _different and _similar as args to my XHR
[23:47:38] <DarkSector> and window.array_name still sends null
[23:48:13] <Cork> DarkSector: theres no magic way to reach into another scope
[23:48:29] <Cork> you need to actively set the value globally like i did in the example
[23:48:36] <DarkSector> oh wait, does that mean I haven't defined the variables as global
[23:48:39] <DarkSector> oh god, sorry
[23:48:41] <DarkSector> let me do that first
[23:48:42] <Cork> yes
[23:50:40] <DarkSector> Cork: \o/ it works :) thanks one more question, var window.foo is incorrect declaration, why?
[23:50:52] <DarkSector> I mean only window.foo seems to work
[23:51:02] <Cork> cause window is already declared
[23:51:12] <Cork> your just adding a property to the old object
[23:51:18] <DarkSector> oh ofcourse, understood
[23:51:44] <Cork> and to be a bit more precise, "window.foo" isn't a valid variable name :)
