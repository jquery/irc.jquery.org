[00:00:00] <Eviltwin> as long as it's on something that is or contains something that can take input
[00:00:02] <Eviltwin> It should work fine
[00:00:20] <Cork> ya
[00:00:55] <Cork> what i meant is emplty page with a div in (some text in the div, but nothing else), the div won't get the keyevents
[00:01:34] <Cork> as it can't have focus so the input never gets to it or any element below it
[00:11:06] <lumio> hello, I'm animating a webpage.... and when the animation is finished, I redirect the site to another uri... the problem right now is, that when I press the back-button, the page is like I left it. How can I reset it?
[00:17:36] <rmancy> I've just notived that if I detach() an element that has display:none, it doesn't actually detach.
[00:17:56] <rmancy> This is with version 1.5
[00:18:00] <rmancy> Seems odd no ?
[00:21:01] <redfox75> i've a problem with input text, when I refresh page it doesn't reset. How I can forse it?
[00:21:04] <redfox75> force
[00:21:16] <redfox75> (if I make shift-f5 it resets
[00:21:18] <redfox75> )
[00:21:52] <Cork> redfox75: it actually does
[00:22:05] <Cork> but the browsers formfill readds the old values
[00:22:25] <Cork> you would have to set them to "" on load
[00:22:28] <mengu> hi all. i wonder one thing. http://pastie.org/private/jijni8zm5mannm36j3a2sw. the workOnAssets method is giving me a "jQuery is not defined" error. can anyone guide me there?
[00:22:36] <redfox75> I maded, but nothing
[00:22:58] <Cork> redfox75: on load or on domready?
[00:23:45] <redfox75> mmm jQuery(document).ready(function(){
[00:24:01] <redfox75> so I should use jQuery(document).load(function(){
[00:24:02] <Cork> thats domready, and it triggers before the formfill
[00:25:12] <redfox75> ....
[00:30:20] <redfox75> Cork: so where I should use it?
[00:30:43] <Cork> .load like you wrote
[00:30:48] <redfox75> ok
[00:31:40] <gray> hey guys
[00:32:30] <gray> anyone reading?
[00:34:50] <gray> hello?
[00:35:55] <Cork> ?ask @ gray
[00:35:56] <bot-t> gray, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:36:50] <gray> ok, thx. well i've encountered some problem that just happens in IE9. works fine in lower versions and other browsers. i'm not sure whether its my code or a bug
[00:36:53] <asd12a> hi, how can i do something after an image is fully loaded/downloaded ?
[00:36:54] <gray> http://jsfiddle.net/ATWpB/3/
[00:37:25] <ch3mi0n> Morning
[00:37:29] <Cork> asd12a: bind the load event to the images element before it starts loading see ?.load
[00:37:30] <bot-t> asd12a, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[00:38:56] <red> Hello, I'm using $('embed').hide(); to hide embed frames while they are loading
[00:39:12] <red> but when I try to .show() after about 2000ms delay, I get uncaught property 0 error
[00:39:29] <aaronmcadam> nice
[00:39:30] <red> I can however use .css('display', 'block') to unhide it, seems weird
[00:39:50] <Cork> red: try wrapping the element in a normal element, like a div, and hide that instead
[00:39:55] <red> okay
[00:40:11] <Cork> red: adding css on embed and object can often have wierd effects
[00:40:14] <aaronmcadam> that /is/ weird tho
[00:41:09] <Cork> well its replaced content, thats handled by external parts to the browser
[00:41:23] <aaronmcadam> yes
[00:41:24] <Cork> so you often have to tred with cation when your around it :)
[00:41:29] <redfox75> Cork: it doesn't work
[00:41:53] <Cork> redfox75: wierd, how are you resetting it?
[00:42:20] <redfox75> Cork: jQuery(document).load(function(){jQuery(".ui-autocomplete-input").val(" ");});
[00:42:20] <gray> any ideas how to fix this IE9 thingy?
[00:42:32] <redfox75> i used "" too
[00:42:51] <Cork> gray: i don't have the time to dig into ie behavior right now
[00:43:09] <Cork> redfox75: can you reset the form?, or is there other thing in it?
[00:43:27] <Cork> form.reset() might fix it, not sure though
[00:43:33] <thevoice-> Okay another question
[00:43:55] <thevoice-> how do I force a redirect despite the fact that a jquery is waiting for a response
[00:44:23] <Cork> redfox75: was a while since i needed to fiddle with the formfill and ie has changed its solution since
[00:44:33] <redfox75> the field is an autocomplete field
[00:44:59] <Cork> redfox75: and it shouldn't ever hold a value or what?
[00:45:31] <Cork> if, yes, remove the name attribute
[00:46:40] <gray> i thought it might be a known bug. i read a ticket about a similar problem but the only solution was changing the animation time. which doesnt change anything
[00:46:55] <red> cork: thanks, got it to work now
[00:47:18] <red> followup: Is there any way to trigger JS code after <embed> object has loaded up?
[00:47:23] <red> Or is there no way to track when its ready
[00:47:39] <Cork> red: that depends on the plugin
[00:48:08] <Cork> some plugins trigger load events, some have there own, some don't have any at all
[00:50:53] <cgiGeek> morning/evening
[00:51:18] <redfox75> Cork: solved, was on the code that initialize the autocomplete. I solved with a .create on element.THANK YOU you save me
[00:51:19] <redfox75> ;)
[00:52:05] <Cork> redfox75: didn't really do much
[00:56:35] <Xotix> anyone has experience with .template()?
[00:56:48] <Cork> little
[00:57:13] <Xotix> They say it's beta. How stable is it?
[00:57:58] <Cork> ah the built in one?
[00:58:09] <Cork> haven't touch that one
[00:58:10] <Xotix> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.template/
[00:58:23] <Xotix> ok
[00:58:25] <Anime> http://jqueryfordesigners.com/demo/image-load-demo.php is this the most elegant way to show a loading overlay while the image loads?
[01:03:16] <Xotix> to check if an file has been chosen on a file input, is there a better way then if($('#uploadedfile').val() != "")?
[01:12:35] <cgiGeek> if I have many fields of which I dont know the name off, how can I generate them all for a .post call :(
[01:13:37] <thevoice-> unload does not appear to be aborting my function.
[01:17:55] <thevoice->  $(window).unload( function () { phpreq.abort(); });
[01:18:10] <thevoice-> why does;t this statement work when I try to kill a request when I redirect a page?
[01:18:27] <thevoice-> where phpreq = .ajax....
[01:18:27] <MoTiOnXml> i'm getting a weird error from calling a jsonp service; the succes callback is invoked using regular http, but i'm getting an "; expected" error when i use https
[01:19:10] <MoTiOnXml> the json response from http and https looks identical
[01:19:30] <Cork> MoTiOnXml: then the service might not support jsonp
[01:19:39] <Cork> jsonp should return a javascript function not json
[01:20:53] <MoTiOnXml> Cork: actually, i just inspected the json-response and the WCF service in fact doesn't yield a jsonp response
[01:21:15] <Cork> MoTiOnXml: then you can't access it cross domain
[01:21:20] <MoTiOnXml> Cork: with http it's jQuery8274928374(args), but with https it's {"d":{"__type":"ResponseOfArrayOfCon ...
[01:21:35] <MoTiOnXml> Cork: it's not cross domain
[01:21:50] <MoTiOnXml> Cork: it's about the remote service having to support two types of bindings, http and https
[01:22:03] <larsemil> waiting for $(document).ready() and then run a function, nothing happens. run it again, it happens. it is doing some stuff to images, can it be that the images are not loaded?
[01:22:08] <MoTiOnXml> Cork: not related to jQuery i reckon but thanks for helping out :)
[01:22:51] <Cork> MoTiOnXml: jsonp HAS to be in the form function <furnciton name>() { return "json-string"/json-object; }
[01:23:05] <Cork> MoTiOnXml: else services can't load it
[01:23:22] <Cork> if its just a {} then you need to load it as json
[01:23:29] <Cork> not jsonp
[01:23:51] <MoTiOnXml> Cork: works perfectly using http, but with https on the exact same domain/address it just returns a standard json-encoded response instead of jsonp-encoded response

[01:26:31] <woozly> guys, how to select all TR tags, which haven't 'noclick' class ?
[01:26:35] <woozly> please help
[01:26:47] <thevoice-> so how do I make my browser redirect during an ajax request(I want it to run in the background)
[01:26:49] <thevoice-> I just tried unload
[01:26:52] <Cork> ?:not @ woozly
[01:26:52] <thevoice-> didn't wor
[01:26:52] <bot-t> woozly, :not(selector): Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[01:27:10] <thevoice-> * by background I mean server side at that point it shouldn't effect the users browsing experience
[01:27:29] <thevoice-> When I try to redirect though it waits for the ajax request to finish
[01:28:46] <mengu> when i append jquery like this: http://pastie.org/private/jijni8zm5mannm36j3a2sw how can i access the jQuery inside my namespace?
[01:29:56] <Cork> mengu: you would have to attach a load event on the script tag
[01:30:06] <Cork> and wait for its callback so you know when the script is loaded
[01:30:55] <Cork> mengu: and please don't dubble post
[01:31:03] <woozly> guys, I have tr and td with class 'noclick' and without it. And I need to listen click event on tr and not click on td which has .noclick class. How Can I do it? $("tr:not(.noclick),:not(td.noclick)") not work...
[01:31:38] <mengu> Cork: i've done that like: jq.addEventListener("load", console.log(jQuery), false) though it did not work
[01:31:42] <McNulty_> Any idea why .find('select.foo option[title="bar"]').attr('disabled', true).remove() would silently fail in IE7? (the 'disabled' was a previous attempt to fix the problem - might be a red herring)
[01:31:53] <Cork> woozly: $("tr:not(.noclick), td:not(.noclick)") should work
[01:32:34] <Cork> mengu: console.log(jQuery) isn't a function reference, its a function call
[01:32:50] <Cork> try jq.addEventListener("load", function() { console.log(jQuery); }, false)
[01:33:55] <mengu> ah, that's what i was missing, i am sorry
[01:33:58] <mengu> thanks Cork
[01:34:06] <Cork> np
[01:54:32] <hiistjustmeee> does anyone know  how this piece of code works?

[01:57:17] <MoTiOnXml> Cork: the https issue has been resolved; it was indeed a bindingissue
[01:58:20] <Neil_> Can I write an if condition using jQuery that queries whether or not the page was loaded less than 10 seconds ago?
[02:00:03] <Neil_> It might read like: if page.loaded.less_than_10_seconds_ago {}
[02:01:43] <Xotix> hi im adding a button to an element when clicking on it. the button doesnt work with click() but with live. why? wheres the difference?
[02:04:43] <dwarder> i'm trying to create some kind of wrapper for $.ajax and i can't figure out how can i pass success function to success section of $.ajax
[02:04:48] <dwarder> http://jsfiddle.net/yGx7x/
[02:12:15] <ajpiano> Neil_: 1 sec
[02:12:22] <Neil_> ajpiano: Sure
[02:14:51] <ajpiano> Neil_: here's a very basic approach to it http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/yXL5S/
[02:17:00] <Neil_> ajpiano: Thanks. Could I make that entire function return true or false?
[02:18:22] <ajpiano> yes
[02:18:22] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/yXL5S/1/
[02:18:40] <Xotix> whats the difference between on and live?
[02:19:08] <ajpiano> live has a lot of additional overhead and is kinda magic
[02:19:15] <Neil_> ajpiano: Thanks again. So can I call that function from a function outside the $(document).ready(function()?
[02:19:44] <Xotix> can i convert live.(click….) to simply on(click…)?
[02:20:02] <ajpiano> Neil_: no, you can only do that if you define the function outisde of the document ready block http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/yXL5S/2/
[02:20:20] <ajpiano> but now you will have been measuring the amount of time since that function itself was compiled, not since the document ready
[02:20:24] <ajpiano> donno if that matters to you
[02:20:53] <ajpiano> Xotix: no, you do $(document).on("click", "selector", fn); to emulate live, Xotix
[02:21:30] <ajpiano> Xotix: fwiw the docs literally have this information
[02:21:31] <ajpiano> in them
[02:21:42] <Neil_> ajpiano: I have another function that should only run if the page loaded more than 10 seconds ago and my plan was to have a variable/function that I could use in conditions to determine whether or not to procedd.
[02:22:45] <ajpiano> Neil_: it might make a lot more sense to like, setTimeout( theFunctionThatNeedsToBeRun10SecondsLater, 10000) inside of the document ready block
[02:23:52] <ajpiano> it sounds like you are crafting a very unique snowflake
[02:23:58] <Neil_> ajpiano: Sure.
[02:24:03] <ajpiano> and i don't want to interfere with your craftsmanship
[02:24:07] <ajpiano> aka it's bedtime
[02:24:37] <Neil_> ajpiano: We have a chat app and I'm working on a basic chat bot. The bot is called to respond to any messages after they run through a messages.publish().
[02:24:49] <ajpiano> ?g hubot github
[02:24:50] <bot-t> ajpiano, github/hubot - GitHub - https://github.com/github/hubot
[02:25:24] <Neil_> ajpiano: The problem is that our messaging system delivers a whole load of message history once the page loads and therefore causes the bot to respond to any old messages.
[02:25:39] <Xotix> ajpiano:  okay. i could also just use click and put the code into an other click (in the first click the html gets created to which i applied live(click)) but maybe, on is a nicer solution?
[02:25:56] <Neil_> ajpiano: I saw hubot a while back. Sounds interesting.
[02:25:58] <ajpiano> Xotix: i have barely the ability to parse what you're saying right now at all
[02:26:24] <ajpiano> im gonna go do harikari or something like that guys, good luck with your javascripts
[02:26:53] <Neil_> ajpiano: Thanks. bye for now.

[03:00:07] <woozly> guys, how to check selector got object or not?
[03:01:48] <elHannes> hi peeps! One question ... how can i find a specific (dom) element in some loaded html content, like http://jsfiddle.net/zYdcb/
[03:03:15] <Cork> elHannes: exactly what your doing should work
[03:03:27] <Cork> but i guess you want the #wanted too?
[03:03:37] <elHannes> uhm, yes thats what i want
[03:03:44] <elHannes> i have a given html source as string
[03:03:58] <elHannes> and then want to get a specific dom elemnt inside this html code
[03:04:58] <Cork> elHannes: is the original in source or why are you going the round about way your going?
[03:05:32] <Cork> just doing $('#target').html($('#stuff').find('#wanded')); should work
[03:05:36] <elHannes> that is simplified to explain my problem, in my case i get the html via an ajax call
[03:05:43] <Cork> ah
[03:06:11] <Cork> $('<div/>').html($(html).find('#wanted')).html()
[03:06:27] <Cork> elHannes: html() is the same as innerHTML
[03:06:32] <Cork> though there is no need to use it
[03:06:56] <Cork> just do $('#target').html($(html).find('#wanted'));
[03:08:26] <elHannes> doesnt work http://jsfiddle.net/zYdcb/1/  ...
[03:10:20] <Cork> elHannes: http://jsfiddle.net/zYdcb/2/
[03:10:42] <Cork> you want filter as its not children of the selected elements, it is the selected elements
[03:11:05] <elHannes> aaah, filter of coruse
[03:11:07] <elHannes> thank you :D
[03:11:09] <Cork> if you had started from the #stuff level it would have been find
[03:11:38] <Cork> but now stuff is gone so all there is is #wanted and #unwanted in the selection
[03:12:37] <elHannes> thats alright for now, gives me something to go an
[03:12:52] <elHannes> you have done me  (and mankind) a great service, thank you :D
[03:13:19] <Cork> lol
[03:17:15] <Xotix> Do you say getCssFromElement or OfElement?
[03:46:14] <nospinzy>  is there anyway to find comscore like data for free?
[03:54:22] <emx> how do i reverse the set of elements?
[03:55:37] <ravenzz> emx http://api.jquery.com/toArray/#example-0 i guess
[03:58:56] <ikss_> hello
[03:59:09] <tempel> hello
[03:59:26] <ikss_> https://gist.github.com/f0090248517f73c25891 - any ideas why this code - when i remove if ( ! dwt.exists ( jQuery ) ) - crashes jquery itself?
[04:00:06] <Anime> hmm, question. all <img> slides scaling both axis? i always used slideup/down for divs and it does what i wanted. had it aplied to an image right now and its scaling both axis, not just y
[04:01:27] <Xotix> can i create something in my plugin, on which i can listen and if it happens, do something?
[04:01:52] <ikss_> Xotix, using events?
[04:03:34] <xec> yeah, like ikss_ says, you can just bind and trigger your own custom event(s)
[04:08:38] <MoTiOnXml> how come this isn't giving me an array? ([ {"city":"cph"}, {"surname":"borum"} ])
[04:09:19] <Xotix> xec i'd do that with on?
[04:09:51] <shesek> MoTiOnXml, how do you figure that?
[04:10:02] <xec> Xotix: i would assume so
[04:11:32] <Cork> ?eval ([ {"city":"cph"}, {"surname":"borum"} ])
[04:11:33] <bot-t> Cork: [{"city": "cph"}, {"surname": "borum"}]
[04:11:40] <Cork> MoTiOnXml: wfm
[04:11:50] <Cork> () isn't valid json though
[04:12:16] <shesek> ?eval ([ {"city":"cph"}, {"surname":"borum"} ]).constructor === Array
[04:12:16] <bot-t> shesek: true
[04:12:43] <ikss_> anyone can help with this object prototype? ;<
[04:13:07] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('([ {"city":"cph"}, {"surname":"borum"} ])')
[04:13:08] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: JSON.parse
[04:13:11] <xec> Xotix: http://jsfiddle.net/XMu84/
[04:13:38] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('[ {"city":"cph"}, {"surname":"borum"} ]')

[04:13:55] <dirkpennings> guys, should I use getScript() or should I just avoid it?
[04:14:00] <asdf12a> hi guys, i want to do some stuff when a image loads, however, i don't need it to fully load, just enough to know what the dimensions are, what should i use??
[04:14:17] <asdf12a> i am currently using load event, but it waits for the image to fully load
[04:14:41] <Cork> asdf12a: don't think you can do that except store the dimentions in the script
[04:15:23] <Cork> dirkpennings: getScript is basically a $.get / $.ajax call that puts the loaded text in a script tag
[04:15:43] <shesek> asdf12a, maybe some different onreadystatechange stage, but I don't think you can
[04:15:54] <Cork> dirkpennings: its fine to use to execute arbitary scripts from the server, but not really optimal to load the default librarys
[04:17:20] <dirkpennings> Cork: ok, thanks, I'm a bit cautious with this, I rather just include the js file.. but wanted to see what u thought about it..
[04:17:21] <Xotix> xec im reading it, thanks. if i apply a event to body, is it available in its children? could i do $(document).trigger(x) and t hen $document.ready() {function(e){somewhere …..     e.x}}?
[04:18:06] <dirkpennings> asdf12a: maybe this is something you're looking for? http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload
[04:19:39] <xec> Xotix: i'm not entirely clear on what you mean, but try it and see? or is this what you mean? http://jsfiddle.net/XMu84/1/
[04:21:07] <xec> Xotix: it won't work the other way around, like binding to a child and triggering on a parent
[04:21:47] <asdf12a> no, it's mainly just needing just to know the image dimensions before rendering the rest of the design elements, which it does, just takes a sec because it waits for the image to fully load
[04:23:29] <asdf12a> but yea i agree storing/passing the dimensions is the right way to probably go about this instead of trying to figure it out during rendering :o
[04:24:41] <MoTiOnXml> is there a way to get the name of a property of an object using an integer-indexer?
[04:25:30] <MoTiOnXml> looks like i'll have to materialize, then index
[04:25:51] <aaronmcadam> anybody using jasmine here?
[04:26:43] <Cork> MoTiOnXml: no, you can loop over all the keys, but thats it
[04:27:18] <minna> Hallo
[04:27:33] <aaronmcadam> does anyone know how to make jasmine show green tests by default
[04:29:43] <atan> I need a dead-simple plugin to convert my .ogg links to a little button a user can click to listen. Which plugin should I look at using for this? :-)
[04:29:59] <atan> Most of the ones I see have whole interfaces and such to go with them... but I don't need that
[04:30:29] <Cork> atan: why use a plugin at all, that should be dead simple to do
[04:31:00] <atan> Cork, using HTML5?
[04:31:17] <Cork> no you would have to use javascript
[04:31:33] <Cork> but basically all you need is an array with ogg file names
[04:31:41] <Cork> with or without .ogg
[04:31:50] <MariusKarthaus> Hi, what selector do I use to match <LI> that have a specific text? :contains does a 'if the word is part of the string'  but I need 'string is exactly this'
[04:31:50] <Cork> then just create links with it
[04:32:08] <xec> Cork: looks to me like he wanted a player
[04:32:24] <blackspotwiggins> <audio> tag
[04:32:35] <blackspotwiggins> cant get more simpler
[04:32:45] <SugaSlide> use comic sans
[04:32:49] <Cork> MariusKarthaus: :contains is the only thing there is, but really, you sould use a class instead
[04:32:57] <Cork> MariusKarthaus: content selectors is dead slow
[04:33:01] <blackspotwiggins> SugaSlide, NO U!
[04:33:09] <SugaSlide> users will be too busy admiring the typeface to worry if it works or not
[04:33:31] <xec> SugaSlide: you mean running away screaming
[04:35:21] <MariusKarthaus> Cork: the <LI>s contain directory and file names, and I need to find the <LI> object that has the exact filename. I do not think that setting the LI class to a filename is a very nice way to do this. Can you select on the content set by data() ?
[04:36:47] <Cork> no
[04:36:50] <SugaSlide> $("li[data='woof']
[04:37:00] <Cork> you cn select based on the data- attribute
[04:37:08] <Cork> *can
[04:37:16] <Cork> but not pure .data()
[04:37:43] <blackspotwiggins> ?filter
[04:37:43] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[04:37:52] <blackspotwiggins> test function can do fuck all
[04:38:01] <MariusKarthaus> I'm guessing data='' will use the DOM attribute data and not the jquery data() store ?
[04:38:07] <Xotix> xe thanks im trying and reading then i should be fine
[04:40:22] <Anime> you guys know why jquery slide scales img's in both axis and slides divs the proper way? i wanted to reproduce the div behavior in img's
[04:40:31] <nospinzy> anyone use meebo ads?
[04:40:38] <nospinzy> how much do you get cpm
[04:40:58] <Cork> MariusKarthaus: yes
[04:41:16] <dirkpennings> when I'm extending a plugin ("overwrite" default behaviour) can I still call it's original functionality? e.g. this._super() ?
[04:41:29] <Cork> MariusKarthaus: but data-<some name>= is read into .data() when the page loads
[04:41:51] <Cork> MariusKarthaus: so if you set it though html it will be selectable
[04:42:55] <MariusKarthaus> Cork: i'll test it out what that does in my case. O it all gets set dynamically the <LI> do not exists at load time but they are loaded later on by ajax. I'll figure this out though. thank you
[04:43:56] <Cork> MariusKarthaus: i would prob keep an assosiated array and find through it
[04:44:10] <Cork> MariusKarthaus: and then keep references to the dom element in the array
[04:44:23] <Cork> or rather in a separat array
[04:45:05] <MariusKarthaus> Yea that was one of the ideas but that would mean keeping two sets of data, and i was hoping on maintaining  just one.
[04:45:33] <Cork> MariusKarthaus: you most likly want to, cause the other one is really slow
[04:45:47] <Cork> you don't want to traverce the entire dom each time you want to find a file name
[04:46:09] <Cork> and on top of that pick out the content text of them and seach it
[04:48:07] <MariusKarthaus> well I've got the problem already reduced to where I only need to traverse a specific UL (directory) for a list of filename. So unless a single directory contains a lot of nodes i'll be alright. But I'll see about that index array, seems like a good idea might not be too much work either.
[04:52:41] <Xotix> xec, you made setTimeout(); if i use that in a plugin i could overwrite it with setTimeout: function() {bla.trigger(newEvent)}? or create a callback like that (without the event stuff)?
[04:53:13] <xec> Xotix: i just used setTimeout to make it not trigger immediately, to demonstrate ;)
[04:53:59] <Xotix> yes, now that i  could use it without it. im just wondering if im correct with what i've said or if it is completely bullshit :P
[04:54:09] <Xotix> +I
[05:09:26] <Hiall> Is it possible to loop through an array but only goto the next item when the function within the loop is complete??

[05:36:50] <karstenk1977_> Hello
[05:37:27] <Xotix> If i drag an element through a list, a placeholder appears. Can i make the placeholder appearing not related to the position of the mouse within the dragged element but related to the middle of it. I know that i can force the position of the mouse into the middle but thats an ugly moving of the element. Maybe i could simulate the position of the mouse?
[05:37:37] <karstenk1977_> i have trouble with a little animation, please have a look   http://pastebin.com/peiyS8Fu
[05:38:21] <karstenk1977_> the problem is callback, if one menu is open, the next one will open with wrong parameter
[05:38:30] <amon293> hey! i'm not getting why supersized doesn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/QsLjg/
[05:38:32] <dAnjou> hi, i use the example code here http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/ . the element fades out and after the animation is finished it fades in at the other place. now is it possible to immediately show the element while it starts fading out?
[05:40:12] <dAnjou> although i imagine that the animation works on an element which is still there so it can't be shown at the same time somewhere else but you know .. hope dies last :P
[05:41:50] <Xotix> http://pastebin.com/RKeP00Dv is it okay if i leave the if and just use the line in it?
[05:42:00] <karstenk1977_> please look for my mistake http://concept.tom-develop.com/   the animation is perfect if you toggle the same menu, but wrong if one menu is open and you want open next one

[05:51:45] <g-hennux> hi!
[05:52:34] <g-hennux> when doing a $(...).load(url); call within a javascript, the cookies of that host are not sent along (a firebug inspection shows that); how can i change that?
[05:58:09] <xec> g-hennux: are you sure? afaik cookies should be sent with every http request
[05:58:25] <karstenk1977_> http://pastebin.com/Mcd6AT9n  to complex?
[05:59:07] <g-hennux> xec: i load a javascript from http://localhost:8080, i load an image from http://localhost:8080/images, but when i say .load(http://localhost:8080/api/...), then the cookie is *not* sent any more
[05:59:56] <xec> what does the original cookie look like, does it include a path?
[06:00:17] <JohnnyDavidson> Is there a way to see what class a variable is?
[06:00:28] <g-hennux> xec: it has Paht=/ set
[06:00:32] <g-hennux> Path
[06:02:37] <g-hennux> xec: but this request also has Origin set, which the others don't
[06:11:34] <amon293> http://jsfiddle.net/QsLjg/2/ - can anyone explain me why supersized isn't working?
[06:16:32] <Xotix> it this a valid plugin structure? the code doesn't rly do anything http://pastebin.com/NGzUhm4C is it the right way to use "private" functions?
[06:17:35] <mathi> hi
[06:18:34] <mathi> I've got a string like: "2011-11_some_data", the first 7 characters include the year and the month. How could I extract these in two variables year and month ?
[06:19:01] <EdwardIII> hrm is there some way i can like..... find backwards? go higher up the dom rather than further down?
[06:19:22] <EdwardIII> kinda like $(elem).findParentRecursively('li') for example
[06:20:02] <EdwardIII> oooh, .closest looks good
[06:20:18] <karstenk1977_> please have a look at this (Link: http://pastebin.com/Mcd6AT9n)http://pastebin.com/Mcd6AT9n    the LINK to my concept is at the bottom, please note the correct user-agent. i have trouble with my callback, for the menu animation. if you toggle the same menu, it works perfect. but if one is open and you want open next, its wrong.   Please help.
[06:21:42] <EdwardIII> ah that's a wicked method

[06:48:57] <jarrod322> hi everyone!
[06:49:14] <jarrod322> im trying to calculate the height of a div with variable height.. is that possible ?
[06:49:31] <crab> $(thatdiv).height()?
[06:49:34] <jarrod322> the div is filled with content and scrolls up. its a chat window where you type text and more and more each text a new line
[06:50:00] <jarrod322> so i want to scroll the div down that works as long as the content is not bigger than the orginal divs height :(
[06:50:22] <jarrod322> this is my code now:     $("#chat_room").scrollBottom($("#chat_room")[0].scrollHeight);
[06:50:26] <Guest87185> i having slow javascript redirect problem i don't used to have. Is there anything changed on new browsers or something ? any ideas where the problem could be?
[06:50:45] <Bartmax> i having slow javascript redirect problem i don't used to have. Is there anything changed on new browsers or something ? any ideas where the problem could be?  (sorry for the duplicate, real name now)
[06:50:57] <jarrod322> Bartmax: maybe reboot if you use windows?
[06:50:58] <riskyS> how do I check that an expiry date has a slash e.g. (12/11) when validating using the jQuery validator plugin?
[06:51:20] <jarrod322> Bartmax: cause js depends on the processor power?? if multiple tabs with js are open it gets slower
[06:51:21] <Bartmax> jarrod322: reboot the server? why that will help with the slow javascript redirectiong ?
[06:51:52] <jarrod322> i once had some animation stuff in jquery done for my work and had several tabs in browser open and it had high impact animation was getting slower and slower
[06:51:55] <jarrod322> just an idea
[06:52:13] <jarrod322> crab:  $(thatdiv).height()? would give me the height of the div
[06:52:19] <jarrod322> i need to get the height of the contents of the div
[06:52:24] <jarrod322> is there something in jquery for that?
[06:52:34] <jarrod322> chat_room div is always same height
[06:52:47] <jarrod322> so i would need to calculate the number of rows/lines in it
[06:53:55] <Bartmax> jarrod322: it happens server side
[06:54:10] <jarrod322> jquery serverside?
[06:54:16] <jarrod322> isent jquery clientside?
[06:54:31] <jarrod322> or i completely misunderstand
[06:55:25] <Bartmax> I mean i have a site
[06:55:29] <Bartmax> that when i do some action
[06:55:33] <Bartmax> it does: top.window.history.back
[06:55:56] <Bartmax> it take between 10 secs to 60 secs to actually goes back
[06:56:02] <koskoz> Hi, can we say that the big image in the header of this link: http://blog.aptonia.com is a caroussel?

[07:01:40] <Silence_> If I write $("a").attr("target", "_blank"); every a tag opens in a new window, but I only want it to happen for links that have the class="static menu-item"
[07:02:57] <chrisvwebdev> $('.static').attr("target","_blank");
[07:05:03] <Silence_> chrisvwebdev: That doesn't work
[07:07:09] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to add a button in ui tabs, but the buttom to be in line with tabs?
[07:11:02] <kedarm> Perhaps this is a naive question. But does anybody know how Facebook status updates (containing a URL) are able to fetch the contents of that URL?
[07:11:30] <SoulRaven> ajax?
[07:12:14] <kedarm> SoulRaven: You mean the Fb servers are fetching those URLs are then JS is displaying the contents on the page?
[07:12:27] <kedarm> ^are^and
[07:12:59] <SoulRaven> ajax, php
[07:13:27] <SoulRaven> you can fetch the content of the all site and parse the data back to another server
[07:13:48] <shesek> kedarm, using a server-side request, ain't possible sending a request there directly with AJAX
[07:13:52] <kedarm> So, is my understanding is correct that something like $.get("some nytimes-url") won't work?
[07:14:05] <Mkop> correct
[07:14:13] <shesek> kedarm, correct. this is due to the same domain origin policy
[07:14:24] <SoulRaven> and after that you cand work with the content as is local
[07:14:47] <shesek> you can only send XHR requests to pages on the same protocol, domain and port
[07:14:57] <kedarm> shesek, Mkop: OK. That's what I thought.
[07:15:16] <shesek> (except for the new stuff that allows you to do cross-domain XHR, but that requires the other website to specifically tell the browser he's agreeing to that)
[07:15:58] <SoulRaven> i have read recenly about that, xhr2 and cross domain
[07:16:16] <SoulRaven> even IE has something like that :))
[07:16:19] <kedarm> So the idea is that as I provide a URL, the text-area is funneling that back to an Fb server which does the heavy-lifting and then JS displays the thumbnails, summary etc.
[07:16:44] <SoulRaven> yes
[07:16:54] <shesek> kedarm, yep, exactly
[07:17:12] <SoulRaven> me now,  is it posibile to add a button in ui tabs, but the buttom to be in line with tabs?
[07:17:13] <SoulRaven> :))
[07:17:59] <shesek> However, its possible to get data from other domains using JSONP, and some services allows you to get arbitrary data from other domains and transmit it to you over JSONP
[07:18:05] <shesek> Like Yahoo's YQL
[07:18:35] <Xotix> how can i do something like $(this + '.editor-text')?
[07:18:52] <shesek> (An SQL-like language for reading data from the web, you can do stuff like SELECT * FROM html WHERE url='http://www.nytimes.com/' AND xpath='//h1'
[07:18:53] <shesek> )
[07:19:14] <minna> Anyone know of any SOAP client for javascript?
[07:19:28] <minna> I found some, but they are _OLD_
[07:19:38] <shesek> why doesn't SOAP just die already? :-(
[07:20:07] <minna> shesek: because some idiot's doesn't know how to upgrade
[07:21:41] <Neil_> Does anyone know how to solve this Date comparison to see if one time is less than 5 seconds after the other? http://pastie.org/2914620
[07:22:11] <SoulRaven> has anyone any ideea about that
[07:22:28] <SoulRaven> how to add a button inline with ui tabs?
[07:22:32] <elHannes> hey everyone, is it possibile to get the xpath for an element with JQ?
[07:22:55] <shesek> Neil_, haven't looked at the code, but +theother - +onetime < 5
[07:22:57] <elHannes> or any kind of string representation that will allow me to reslect the element
[07:23:34] <shesek> elHannes, nope
[07:23:38] <shesek> I once saw a site that had a bookmarklet that does that, tho
[07:23:53] <Neil_> shesek: does the time have to be formatted a certain way for the "5" to be clear?
[07:23:59] <shesek> do note that there isn't an 100% reliable way to do that
[07:24:26] <chrisvwebdev1> Silence...is there any other markup before the anchor elements?
[07:24:40] <shesek> Neil_, it has to be formatted in a way that Date parsing understand - I'm not quite sure what's the format
[07:24:50] <elHannes> hmm,  i woulöd need to at least know the selector that has been sued to select this ...
[07:25:12] <Neil_> shesek: The format is printed in the pastie http://pastie.org/2914620
[07:25:22] <Neil_> shesek: e.g. Thu Nov 24 2011 13:45:48 GMT+0000 (BST)
[07:25:36] <shesek> That seems to be right
[07:25:39] <zulax> can a class be draggable as well? didnt work for me the first try
[07:25:57] <shesek> ?eval +(new Date) - +(new Date('Thu Nov 24 2011 13:45:48 GMT+0000'))
[07:25:58] <bot-t> shesek: 5988947
[07:26:07] <shesek> ?eval new Date
[07:26:07] <bot-t> shesek: <2011-11-24T15:25:46.276Z>
[07:26:22] <shesek> ?eval +(new Date) - +(new Date('Thu Nov 24 2011 13:45:48 GMT+0000')) / 60 / 60
[07:26:23] <bot-t> shesek: 1321781099784.6667
[07:26:30] <shesek> ?eval (+(new Date) - +(new Date('Thu Nov 24 2011 13:45:48 GMT+0000'))) / 60 / 60
[07:26:30] <elHannes> http://jsfiddle.net/ePtQP/  thats basically my problem
[07:26:31] <bot-t> shesek: 1672.7311111111112
[07:26:36] <elHannes> logic wise ...
[07:26:54] <shesek> hmm, that's weird
[07:27:10] <krogant> hi, i'm looking for a simple mp3 player plugin that can play a variety sequence of mp3s if i pass the mp3 filename to it
[07:27:58] <zulax> with jq ui, are only divs draggable or can classes be draggable as well
[07:28:04] <krogant> not looking for video support, just mp3. i'd like to be able to quickly play files where the filename changes dynamically
[07:28:11] <shesek> zulax, `classes` ?
[07:28:34] <zulax> shesek, like a css class
[07:28:41] <zulax> div class="draggable"
[07:29:10] <shesek> zulax, that's a weird question to ask :O
[07:29:17] <zulax> why
[07:29:29] <Xotix> if i do $('div').plugin(); and i want to get all elements within the div i "passed" to the plugin. how would i do that?
[07:29:34] <shesek> draggable is just a method on $.fn, it'll work on whatever DOM element you have on jQuery's object
[07:29:52] <zulax> ok, thanks for clearifying
[07:30:09] <Mkop> zulax: do you understand what a class actually is?
[07:30:19] <EdwardIII> where you go to learn
[07:30:25] <shesek> Xotix, within `plugin`, you can refer to `this` as an jQuery object with all the DOM elements
[07:30:31] <zulax> Mkop, a dom element?
[07:30:44] <shesek> Xotix, e.g. do this.each() or treat it as an array-like object
[07:30:53] <Mkop> zulax: no
[07:31:05] <shesek> zulax, a class name is a dom element?
[07:31:07] <shesek> oh god...
[07:31:07] <Mkop> a dom element can *have* a class (or multiple classes)
[07:31:10] * shesek needs some coffee, bbl
[07:31:36] <zulax> ok
[07:31:47] <Mkop> you can have a <div class="make_this_red"></div> or a <p class="make_this_red"></p> or the like
[07:32:18] <Xotix> shesk i want to achieve that: $(div table .class).plugin(); within the plugin $(this).dblclick( do stuff )  but i want to "outsource" the .class in the selector into the plugin. cause i got several classes to check on several child levels.
[07:32:28] <Mkop> or even <div class="make_this_red make_this_big"></div>
[07:33:09] <shesek> Xotix, inside the plugin, do `this.find('.class')`
[07:33:21] <Mkop> I am not suggesting that make_this_red is a well-named class, but I use that to illustrate that a class is a way to define a list of properties
[07:33:26] <Xotix> shesek im trying that but failing
[07:34:10] <shesek> Xotix, reproduce on jsfiddle
[07:34:17] <Mkop> zulax: go find a good CSS tutorial. learn what a class is, an id is, and how to use them in CSS. when you've done that, jquery selectors will make a lot more sense
[07:34:48] <zulax> i hope i will learn as i go, but thanks for the advice
[07:34:51] <Xotix> shesek mini snippet http://pastebin.com/tDs56ryL i just upload a full demo
[07:35:56] <zulax> Mkop, http://jsfiddle.net/aRbUm/
[07:36:11] <zulax> hoping that should have worked for draggable
[07:36:56] <jorisw> Hi. Anyone know of a table sorter plugin that lets me sort by hidden fields in the cells?
[07:37:06] <jorisw> I want to sort by numbers that I have printed readible
[07:38:33] <Mkop> zulax: you're probably missing the jquery-ui library
[07:38:50] <zulax> jsfiddle doesnt have it
[07:39:15] <zulax> but i am sure jq ui is loaded in my code
[07:39:18] <Mkop> enter it as an additional resource
[07:39:26] <zulax> other things are working
[07:39:42] <Mkop> that code looks like it should work
[07:39:53] <danniel> hi
[07:40:01] <danniel> anybody knows jquery tools?
[07:40:08] <danniel> scrollable
[07:40:44] <Xotix> shesek: i know my issue. that could not have been worked at all. i just thinked wrong. i needed to use     $(this).on("click", '.editor-text', e, function() {
[07:40:44] <Xotix> since you first have to drag and drop them in the container i selected…but thanks
[07:41:04] <danniel> i'm needing to do a scrollable panel with a pager that scroll panel when mouse over
[07:41:14] <elHannes> lol , okay, its easy , just $.fn.foo = function(){ $(this).selector }
[07:41:33] <danniel> jquery tools scrollable only scroll with click
[07:41:34] <Neil_> shesek: This seems to work just fine http://pastie.org/2914710. Thanks for the help.
[07:42:14] <jorisw> got it, tablesort 2.0 has custom cell parsers
[07:49:10] <Xotix> can't i use a plugin within a plugin?
[07:53:04] <slackerr> hi all. i'm apply jquery plugin into some layers, then after some actions i deleting this layers. its for non-reloading ajax pages. but when i load same code into page again, this plugin doesnt works. for example, with selectBox plugin. when i destroy some layers, should i do plugin unactivate, or some similar action? and how? thanks
[07:53:48] <xec> Xotix: sure you can... jquery ui has plenty of plugin dependencies
[07:58:29] <xec> slackerr: i'm sorry -- you are what?
[07:58:41] <koskoz> if I want to append a html tag, can I type .append('<ul>') or do i have to type .append('<ul></ul>')?
[07:59:01] <Xotix> xec, yeah im just weird atm. anyway im gone in 10min :) thanks a lot
[07:59:15] <xec> :)
[08:00:32] <shesek> koskoz, the first one will work too
[08:00:53] <xec> ?tias @ koskoz
[08:00:53] <bot-t> koskoz, Try It And See
[08:01:26] <shesek> I should really start remembering all those ^, it'll save me a lot of typing
[08:02:05] <pashmi56> hi there, i have a form. the submit button is .net "a" tag basically and some js in its href value.  i want to disable the button somehow to prevent the user to double click and perevent form from submitting  hundreds times. do you have any suggestions?
[08:02:09] <koskoz> shesek: the both work, but is jquery closing the tag by itself or is it just the browser which does it?
[08:02:25] <shesek> koskoz, to the best of my knowledge, the browser
[08:03:08] <koskoz> shesek: so '<ul></ul>' is better because there is a closing tag
[08:03:49] <xec> koskoz: afaik, you're not actually creating html, you are creating a DOM node, jQuery just interprets your html string and tries to figure out what you want, basically
[08:04:27] <xec> koskoz: so.. closing tag or not does not matter
[08:04:41] <koskoz> xec: ok, I thought jquery would simply paste the string
[08:05:12] <Neil_> Does anyone know why this basic string comparison isn't working? http://pastie.org/2914746
[08:07:34] <xec> Neil_: maybe there's some extra whitespace ?
[08:07:45] <jwmann> Is there a way in jQuery to enable a hover event?
[08:08:04] <karstenk1977_> please have a look at this (Link: (Link: http://pastebin.com/Mcd6AT9n)http://pastebin.com/Mcd6AT9n)(Link: http://pastebin.com/Mcd6AT9n)http://pastebin.com/Mcd6AT9n    the LINK to my concept is at the bottom, please note the correct user-agent. i have trouble with my callback, for the menu animation. if you toggle the same menu, it works perfect. but if one is open and you want open next, its wrong.   Please help.
[08:08:07] <Neil_> xec: I've checked and there doesn't seem to be. I've tried copying exactly everytime. Would you suggest an alternative route?
[08:08:16] <xec> jwmann: define "enable"? maybe see ?hover

[08:09:05] <xec> Neil_: well, what exactly do you want to check - what is the use case / expected end result
[08:09:23] <jwmann> xec: I'd just like to be able to force an element to appear as if the mouse hovered
[08:09:28] <Whirl3d> Happy Thanksgiving all
[08:10:02] <Neil_> xec: I'm looking to find that the message begins with @someuser - hopefully the pastie clears it up http://pastie.org/2914746. It's for a basic chat bot.
[08:10:32] <xec> jwmann: sorry, don't know. maybe you can .trigger() a mouseover or something
[08:12:05] <Whirl3d> Is there any way to tell the destination animation state from outside the animation?
[08:12:58] <karstenk1977_> please have a look at this (Link: (Link: http://pastebin.com/Mcd6AT9n)http://pastebin.com/Mcd6AT9n)(Link: http://pastebin.com/Mcd6AT9n)http://pastebin.com/Mcd6AT9n    the LINK to my concept is at the bottom, please note the correct user-agent. i have trouble with my callback, for the menu animation. if you toggle the same menu, it works perfect. but if one is open and you want open next, its wrong.

[08:13:02] <jwmann> xec: Okay, I'll look into that
[08:13:30] <Whirl3d> $(".something").animate(someState,3000);  if ($(".something:animated").length) { $(".something").css(someState);}

[08:22:29] <Whirl3d> karstemk1977_, your link just states invalid link id at  pastebin, sorry.
[08:22:55] <Aamir> ?demo @karstenk1977_
[08:22:56] <bot-t> karstenk1977_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[08:23:22] <Aamir> Whirl3d: he meant http://pastebin.com/Mcd6AT9n :P
[08:23:26] <Whirl3d> pashmi56, if you just want to disable the lbtnReply, you set it's disabled attr. to disabled
[08:23:30] <karstenk1977_> there is a link in pastebin to it
[08:23:45] <jwmann> Does anybody know how I could trigger the :hover element state via jQuery?
[08:23:55] <pashmi56> thanks let me try that
[08:24:59] <Segaja> Whirl3d: and the result can be passed as second parameter to jQuery.post() ?

[08:26:45] <Aamir> jwmann:  you can use trigger('mouseover/on') but only if event is similar event is binded using jq. u can trigger :hover
[08:26:53] <Segaja> Whirl3d: never mind, found it
[08:27:09] <karstenk1977_> please have a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/nU3kB/  the LINK to my concept is at the top, please note the correct user-agent. i have trouble with my callback, for the menu animation. if you toggle the same menu, it works perfect. but if one is open and you want open next, its wrong.   Please help.
[08:27:20] <karstenk1977_> so now with jsfiddle^^
[08:28:25] <jwmann> Whirl3d: So I have to have it binded before I can trigger it?
[08:28:39] <Aamir> jwmann: yes
[08:28:47] <jwmann> hmm
[08:28:52] <kanzie> Im tying a click event-handler to a element and then I pass element into a new element using html(), however the click-event does not get triggered. Im using 'on' and I assume this is because I do the html()-thing on the element. Is there any way around this??
[08:28:53] <Whirl3d> jwmann, if you are using hover, it is a shortcut for bind, I believe.
[08:28:55] <karstenk1977_> the proble is, that the opened menu doesn´t get the class 'active' when an other was open before
[08:29:35] <Whirl3d> karstenk1977_, where is the html menu to test it on? The code is hard to debug without a working menu.
[08:29:39] <Aamir> .hover is shortcut for .bind('mouse enter') and .bind('mouseleave')
[08:29:52] <kanzie> cause the trigger works in its original location
[08:30:03] <jwmann> Whirl3d: Well I'm testing it in the console and jQuery("div#node-26").trigger("hover"); doesn't do anything
[08:30:26] <minna> Hm, i get str.split is not a function on: array = str.split(","); Why??
[08:30:28] <kanzie> hmm, do I have to move the element instead of passing it as a parameter of html()

[08:30:47] <Aamir> jwmann:  do you have  jQuery("div#node-26").hover(function(),function()) ?
[08:31:05] <jwmann> Aamir: I'll try that

[08:31:45] <zulax> do you know if there is an out of box way to automatically resore the position of a draggable element?
[08:32:02] <jwmann> maybe I did a mistake
[08:32:08] <alex-> jcart = jquery, right?
[08:32:11] <Aamir> jwmann: i meant to say that use .hover first before you can trigger. see ?hover
[08:32:11] <bot-t> jwmann, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[08:32:18] <zulax> i have a confirmation box and if they say cancel, i want the draggable element to go back to its original plae
[08:32:20] <zulax> ce
[08:32:47] <Aamir> zulax: ok :)
[08:33:10] <jwmann> jQuery("div#node-26").hover().trigger("hover"); ?
[08:33:11] <Aamir> ?nice

[08:33:17] <karstenk1977_> Whirl3d  ->>     NOTE, that if one Menu is open and has class 'active' the next one which opened doesn´t get the class 'active'. das problem liegt wohl am callback the problem probably lies in the callback
[08:33:40] <Whirl3d> karstenk1977_, where is $container defined?
[08:33:52] <Aamir> jwmann:  no no. what you want exactly? if you mean that you have :hover in css and you want to trigger it than its not possible
[08:33:57] <karstenk1977_> http://jsfiddle.net/nU3kB/  LINE3
[08:34:22] <jwmann> Aamir: Yea that is exactly what I wanted to do.
[08:34:27] <Whirl3d> why are you using a global variable declaration?
[08:34:31] <kanzie> Here's what Im trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/rGzyH/
[08:34:47] <kanzie> can anyone tell me what I need to do different to not loose the event-handler on my element
[08:35:10] <Aamir> karstenk1977_:  best thing will be to  get all menu .filter(self) . close(). than $(this).toggle(); something like that :P
[08:35:24] <Aamir> you don't need to keep track of active or nonactive
[08:35:31] <karstenk1977_> http://dev0.tom-develop.com/fileadmin/templates/mikekoenig/scripts/komplett-iphone.js?1322151759
[08:36:12] <karstenk1977_> cause container is be used in other functions too
[08:36:52] <Whirl3d> and w as well?

[08:37:38] <mheap> I know this is the wrong channel, but #requirejs is dead :(
[08:38:09] <mheap> And it's not requireJS I want, thinking about it
[08:38:14] <mheap> I'm trying to add routes at runtime using Backbone
[08:38:14] <kanzie> Aamir: you are avoiding using direct ids
[08:38:27] <mheap> By providing a router.js file with each of my application's modules
[08:38:28] <Aamir> mheap:  http://requirejs.org/
[08:39:03] <mheap> Aamir, I've already read all the docs. I've got the syntax, it's the concept I'm struggling with
[08:39:04] <kanzie> I need to use classes instead of ids if I clone/append it, but Im just curious as why you decided to refer to it as #myFoo div instead of its id #myEvent
[08:39:08] <kanzie> Aamir: see avoe
[08:39:18] <mheap> Looking for someone to sanity check my logic
[08:39:27] <Aamir> kanzie:  you binded element to on element so .click will not work on inner one. also you used .html() which will get the string not the jQuery object
[08:40:10] <kanzie> Aamir: but using append I would get two elements in the dom with same ID right?
[08:42:23] <Olorin-> Hullo. Using $.get() with a function handler and am trying to process the data received. I need to get a specific div out of the data and have tried the following $('.class',data) but it seems to fail. Any pointers? Thanks in advance.
[08:44:31] <Olorin-> +info: `data` contains html from a webpage.
[08:49:42] <kanzie> Aamir: man, can't get it to work
[08:51:15] <minna> Hm, doesn't this return a string into the variable? var str = $(this).attr('onchange').match(/\((.+)\)/); -> returns 33,22,665,664,EN
[08:51:37] <minna> array = str.split(","); returns that str.split is not a function
[08:52:23] <ravenzz> because match returns an array
[08:52:49] <minna> ravenzz: It does? Hm.
[08:52:53] <ravenzz> yep
[08:52:54] <minna> ravenzz: *testing*
[08:53:10] <minna> ravenzz: i thought arrays had to be in [] boxes
[08:53:59] <ravenzz> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match
[08:54:10] <kanzie> the event triggers in the original element, but when I append it to another element it does not follow
[08:54:11] <Aamir> kanzie:  inspect it in firebug/google chrome developer toolbar - http://jsfiddle.net/rGzyH/1/ it actually moved the div so only 1 element with that id
[08:54:12] <minna> ravenzz: No, if i do console.log(str[1]); it returns the whole string again.
[08:54:23] <ravenzz> sure
[08:54:32] <minna> maybe i have to split the match
[08:54:36] <minna> *testing*
[08:54:44] <ravenzz> debut the entire str
[08:54:47] <ravenzz> debug*
[08:54:51] <ravenzz> console.debug(str);
[08:55:08] <minna> console.log(str[1]); returns the same as console.log(str);
[08:55:40] <minna> and if i do var str = $(this).attr('onchange').match(/\((.+)\)/).split(","); i get TypeError: $(this).attr("onchange").match(/\((.+)\)/).split is not a function
[08:56:48] <ravenzz> what are you trying to do?
[08:57:01] <minna> just split the numbers into arrays.
[08:57:07] <ravenzz> check if there is a function within the onchange event?
[08:57:34] <Mkop> am I correct in assuming that any latency between DomContentLoaded and when the pages finishes loading (the blue and red bars in FireBug Net panel) is due to slowness in $(document).ready() scripts?
[08:57:38] <minna> ravenzz: im not trying to run the function on the onchange event, just trying to get the data into a variable
[08:57:42] <ravenzz> give me an example of string :o
[08:57:58] <RoosterJuice> can you reference the first part of an element's classname?
[08:58:00] <ravenzz> that's what I say
[08:58:10] <ravenzz> *almost*
[08:58:11] <RoosterJuice> to refer to all elements that contain those characters?
[08:58:24] <ravenzz> :?
[08:58:28] <minna> UpdateItem(this.value,13133,0,5555,54333,'','EN');
[08:58:43] <RoosterJuice> for example  $('.text*')
[08:59:04] <ravenzz> ok then, would you get any value within the brachets?
[08:59:31] <ravenzz> RoosterJuice maybe $('[class^="text"]')
[08:59:40] <minna> ravenzz: When i do the match, i get this.value,13133,0,5555,54333,'','EN'
[09:00:14] <minna> ravenzz: just as expected. But i'm tryting to split each value that's seperated by , into it's own array
[09:00:26] <minna> -own
[09:01:35] <ravenzz> minna ok
[09:02:11] <ravenzz> i told you you should debug str in order to understand what you got after match()
[09:02:47] <minna> ravenzz: I did, and i told you :)
[09:03:18] <ravenzz> minna http://jsfiddle.net/4ZBr8/
[09:06:19] <ravenzz> minna foo[1] is what you should split()
[09:06:46] <ravenzz> but I would check if there are matches before to do the split
[09:07:05] <minna> Aha, it's returning both into two variables.. that's odd
[09:07:13] <ravenzz> both?
[09:08:44] <ravenzz> anyway maybe ([^\)]+) is better than (.+)
[09:09:06] <andrew9183> is there any way i can search by a prefix ? ie i have <div id="foo_1">, <div id="foo_2">
[09:09:11] <andrew9183> want to search by foo
[09:09:17] <ravenzz> yep
[09:09:19] <minna> ravenzz: This is what i get http://jsfiddle.net/4ZBr8/2/
[09:09:23] <ravenzz> ?selectors @ andrew9183
[09:09:24] <bot-t> andrew9183, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 13, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[09:09:35] <minna> I'm sure, my regex is not good
[09:09:37] <ravenzz> it's down the hall
[09:09:55] <ravenzz> no np I am not that good with regex as well
[09:10:20] <andrew9183> okay i know the selectors but how would i search b y partial id ?
[09:10:20] <Haprog> andrew9183: $('[id|="foo_"]')
[09:10:31] <andrew9183> ah
[09:10:39] <andrew9183> that works, thanks Haprog
[09:10:41] <ravenzz> yep the 1st one foo[0] is the match the 2nd one is the substring you are selecting (.+)
[09:10:55] <minna> Aah.
[09:11:51] <minna> I wanted to select the stuff between () but the escaped () also took the () characters, thus i added another () but that grouped it and thus made it into an array?
[09:13:47] <ravenzz> stuffs within the round parentheses are substring
[09:14:36] <ravenzz> so If you want to match a parenthesis you should escape that yep
[09:14:52] <minna> ravenzz: Ok, do you know how i would match only the stuff inside the () and not the () characters?
[09:15:18] <ravenzz> the way you are doing that is correct.
[09:15:37] <ravenzz> you will ever got the 1st element of the array containing the entire match
[09:17:13] <minna> Ok, thanks
[09:17:53] <ravenzz> In any case that way is not even safe. Indeed you don't know what the onchange value could contain
[09:18:26] <fff> hi
[09:18:50] <Olorin-> Hullo. Using $.get() with a function handler and am trying to process the data received. I need to get a specific div out of the data and have tried the following $('.class',data) but it seems to fail. Any pointers? Thanks in advance.
[09:18:51] <ravenzz> so you should build the regex as stronger as possible
[09:19:03] <minna> ravenzz: Hm, ok, will try and read up on regexp.
[09:19:23] <ravenzz> but if it is just an exercise, go ahead..it is ok
[09:19:46] <minna> ravenzz: Not an exercise, i'm helping a friend, and learning at the same time :-)
[09:20:04] <ravenzz> ok then ;) have fun
[09:20:10] <minna> ravenzz: The course won't cover array's, it's not part of jquery
[09:20:19] <ravenzz> oh lol
[09:20:29] <minna> Yeah, i know, right.
[09:20:50] <minna> They let us manipulate elements, but not make arrays. *sad panda*
[09:20:52] <ravenzz> Olorin- what about $(data).find('.class') ?
[09:21:15] <Olorin-> hmm well $(data) seems to introduce problems already
[09:21:26] <ravenzz> if you would read something about that / js in general you can start from here http://eloquentjavascript.net
[09:21:38] <Olorin-> I'm pulling a webpage, and the jQuery conversion sort of messes up for the blog page I'm using to test
[09:21:40] <ravenzz> it is pretty basic, but nice
[09:22:10] <ravenzz> Olorin- uh dunno, can you provide a live demo?
[09:23:03] <Olorin-> oh err sorry
[09:23:07] <Olorin-> I am being rather vague yes
[09:23:18] <Olorin-> I'm testing locally with Chrome's dev tools
[09:23:22] <Olorin-> so I'll pastebin it instead
[09:23:39] <ravenzz> no live?
[09:24:03] <Olorin-> there is none atm I'm afraid

[09:24:20] <Olorin-> pasting that code into firebug/chromdevtools should do the job tho
[09:24:36] <Olorin-> it hooks onto all a:links and if they're internal, it tries to load it without reloading
[09:24:39] <Olorin-> the page
[09:24:43] <Olorin-> at least that's what I'm aiming for
[09:25:04] <Olorin-> and ideally, I'd like users to be able to define a container
[09:25:11] <Olorin-> which is why I need the .find functionality working
[09:25:47] <ravenzz> so I will look at the $.get call ok? everything else is working right?
[09:26:03] <Olorin-> yes
[09:26:08] <Olorin-> thanks a million btw :)
[09:26:20] <Mkop> anyone recommend a good, simple (no performance issues) tree plugin? I just replaced our old menu with dynatree, but performance in IE is not great. takes ~3 seconds to render (since our menu is ginormous)
[09:27:49] <Mkop> ginormous = 134 nested items
[09:27:55] <Mkop> that includes the folders
[09:28:12] <Olorin-> that's... quite ginormous :P
[09:28:17] <Olorin-> I've no idea tho I'm afraid
[09:28:48] <Mkop> probably needs to be trimmed at some point. it is well categorized so it's not a UI mess, but it's still hefty
[09:29:11] <ravenzz> Olorin- so did you debut data?
[09:29:32] <Olorin-> sorry, I don't understand the phrase "debut data"
[09:30:29] <ravenzz> debug typo
[09:30:29] <ravenzz> :P
[09:30:48] <Olorin-> yes I did :)
[09:30:57] <Olorin-> it returns a webpage's html as it should
[09:31:06] <Olorin-> however, $(data) contains a mess
[09:31:08] <ravenzz> how can i test it?
[09:31:09] <Olorin-> and $data is invalid
[09:31:18] <Olorin-> do you use firefox or chrome?
[09:31:49] <Olorin-> you can visit any website which has jquery like mine: http://www.swook.net/
[09:31:51] <ravenzz> yes
[09:31:59] <Olorin-> then in firebug or chrome's developer tools
[09:32:07] <Olorin-> paste the whole plugin code into the console
[09:32:23] <Olorin-> once done, you can click on any internal link
[09:32:34] <Olorin-> the idea is that internal links shouldn't make the webpage flicker
[09:32:37] <ravenzz> I mean can I emulate that on jsfiddle?
[09:32:50] <Olorin-> ooer
[09:32:55] <Olorin-> I've never tried jsfiddle
[09:33:01] <Olorin-> just a mo while I Google :)
[09:35:12] <stongo> is it possible to select an object created with .append() in the same script?
[09:36:11] <stongo> ie. $('div').append('<p class="p">hello</p>'); ..... $('.p').fadeOut();
[09:36:52] <Olorin-> doesn't it return the object?
[09:37:56] <Olorin-> stongo: http://api.jquery.com/append/#comment-92111434
[09:38:07] <Olorin-> appendTo seems to be your answer
[09:38:20] <Olorin-> ravenzz: I don't think jsfiddle is useful for this case
[09:38:27] <Olorin-> I'm not aware fully of its use though
[09:39:11] <ravenzz> mh
[09:39:14] <ravenzz> check this http://jsfiddle.net/GPJtE/1/
[09:40:07] <stongo> how about adding an event to an appended object?
[09:40:14] <stongo> is that possible?
[09:40:29] <ravenzz> do that before the append()
[09:40:48] <andrew9183> http://jsfiddle.net/hS8wr/
[09:40:52] <stongo> ravenzz: ah cool!
[09:41:09] <andrew9183> anyone know how to implement this corrrectly, basically i match 5 elements, and want to print the index of each element inside each()
[09:41:27] <Olorin-> meh
[09:41:30] <[mgw]> hiya hi, i'm trying to clone an element and insert into DOM
[09:41:33] <Olorin-> sorry, I fail to see the fix ravenzz
[09:41:50] <[mgw]> however i'm having trouble either getting events to hook or - it seems like i need to refresh the DOM somehow.  does this make sense and/or is this a typical problem?
[09:42:12] <ravenzz> something like var foo = $('<a/>').attr('href','http://b.ar').text('bar').click(function() { foo(); }).appendTo('body');
[09:42:30] <andrew9183> ah got it, theres a callback with two objects
[09:42:36] <andrew9183> is objects the right term ?
[09:43:23] <ravenzz> Olorin- there is no fixies, I tried to select $(data).find('#header').html() and it printed the right stuffs I guess
[09:43:53] <k2iguvahetaja> hello
[09:44:01] <k2iguvahetaja> in the examples appendTo is used, when I try $.tmpl(a,b).html() only the first part is returned
[09:44:12] <k2iguvahetaja> well I could do some placeholder div
[09:44:23] <k2iguvahetaja> is it the way to go?
[09:44:29] <Olorin-> ah I see
[09:44:42] <[mgw]> guys if i insert into the DOM after page load, and then i try to call some traversal functions on the new element, is it not supposed to work?
[09:44:49] <ravenzz> I have to go sorry
[09:45:18] <[mgw]> k2iguvahetaja why are you using $.tmpl
[09:45:26] <k2iguvahetaja> is it bad?
[09:45:31] <k2iguvahetaja> ill get my domain object via json
[09:45:39] <k2iguvahetaja> I need to to put it into google maps tooltip
[09:45:48] <k2iguvahetaja> and little html around it
[09:45:49] <[mgw]> weird, i've not seen $.tmpl
[09:46:03] <k2iguvahetaja> I did the placeholder thing
[09:46:04] <k2iguvahetaja> worked
[09:46:12] <[mgw]> so it's useful for turning $.data into a JSON object???
[09:46:19] <k2iguvahetaja> wat
[09:46:27] <[mgw]> what the hell do you se $.tmpl for
[09:46:33] <k2iguvahetaja> I get my domain objects via json via ajax request
[09:46:39] <k2iguvahetaja> then I iterate over them in js
[09:46:43] <k2iguvahetaja> and make markers for google maps
[09:46:47] <[mgw]> and $.tmpl does that?
[09:46:50] <k2iguvahetaja> and these markers have tooltips
[09:46:57] <[mgw]> yea i'm familiar with Gmaps
[09:46:58] <k2iguvahetaja> I want html in tooltips
[09:47:05] <[mgw]> ok i've done that too, just not using $.tmpl
[09:47:06] <k2iguvahetaja> well I could just append string and variables
[09:47:10] <k2iguvahetaja> but I think its ugly
[09:47:14] <k2iguvahetaja> ala
[09:47:34] <k2iguvahetaja> '<h1>' + domainObject.keku + '</h1>'
[09:47:38] <k2iguvahetaja> with tmpl I could do
[09:47:57] <k2iguvahetaja> $.tmpl('<h1>${keku}</h1>', domainObject)
[09:48:14] <[mgw]> sounds like you shouldn't do it that way at all
[09:48:21] <[mgw]> what happens onceyou get more complicated markup
[09:48:25] <k2iguvahetaja> yes it should
[09:48:25] <[mgw]> run a separate request thread
[09:48:40] <k2iguvahetaja> then i would be f**ked when I was not using templates
[09:48:45] <[mgw]> then use some data or server-side lang to put that shit in
[09:48:55] <k2iguvahetaja> since Im using them its ok to have more complicated markup
[09:49:12] <k2iguvahetaja> like fetch via ajax the contents of tooltips?
[09:49:13] <[mgw]> what?
[09:49:15] <k2iguvahetaja> no
[09:49:23] <[mgw]> uh yes
[09:49:26] <k2iguvahetaja> no
[09:49:31] <k2iguvahetaja> major overhead
[09:49:32] <[mgw]> ok why not tooth fairy
[09:49:43] <[mgw]> depends but the way i see it not really
[09:49:44] <k2iguvahetaja> when I have like 30 domain objects in 1 page
[09:49:47] <k2iguvahetaja> + 30 http requests
[09:49:47] <ryanneufeld> ajax call for every tool tip is fucking stupid
[09:49:51] <k2iguvahetaja> yes
[09:49:56] <k2iguvahetaja> atleast someone gets it
[09:50:04] <[mgw]> so parse it as you get it
[09:50:05] <[mgw]> jesus
[09:50:17] <[mgw]> stop crying about it and answer my question
[09:50:19] <ryanneufeld> have one ajax call that retrieves and caches all the tool tips as JSON from the server
[09:50:28] <k2iguvahetaja> what was the question?
[09:50:30] <ryanneufeld> then pull out what you need when you need it.
[09:50:48] <[mgw]> so if i do a fresh DOM insertion, it seems like i can't use traversal methods like $.parents on it
[09:50:52] <ryanneufeld> k2iguvahetaja: you want html tool tips, check out qtip, I think that one does it, or it has a sibling that does
[09:51:04] <[mgw]> specifically i'm doing a $.clone operation
[09:51:05] <k2iguvahetaja> I have tool tips via gmaps api
[09:51:16] <k2iguvahetaja> I just want to add a little html into there
[09:51:17] <[mgw]> so the returned $.parents are the source object from the $.clone operation if that makes sense
[09:51:17] <k2iguvahetaja> in JS
[09:51:23] <k2iguvahetaja> mgw, sorry, I dont know
[09:51:32] <[mgw]> what?
[09:51:35] <andrew9183> hey guys, how would i structure a Person object for a list of persons.  each person has a name and an address.  ie i want Person.name and Person.address then a Person.info() method to return both the name and address ?
[09:51:36] <[mgw]> you guys are fucks
[09:51:39] <k2iguvahetaja> no
[09:51:41] <[mgw]> gmaps has tooltips in the API dipshits
[09:51:50] <[mgw]> it supports HTML too
[09:51:52] <k2iguvahetaja> you still dont get it
[09:52:08] <ryanneufeld> [mgw]: insulting us isn't accomplishing anything
[09:52:19] <[mgw]> sure it does
[09:52:21] <ryanneufeld> [mgw]: grow up.
[09:52:33] <k2iguvahetaja> Im using them, I just want that the contents of tooltip would look like <h1>Domainobject title</h1><p>text</p>
[09:52:36] <[mgw]> good statement
[09:52:49] <k2iguvahetaja> so you would fetch all the contents via independent ajax request?
[09:52:53] <k2iguvahetaja> and render it server side?
[09:52:57] <[mgw]> i get ya
[09:53:03] <[mgw]> well whenever you get those initial 30 or so objects
[09:53:16] <[mgw]> that's when you parse them... insert them into the DOM in some separate place, then grab with jQuery
[09:53:20] <[mgw]> run the call via Gmaps and you're done
[09:53:53] <[mgw]> yes, don't call 1 ajax per tooltip, but find a way to cache it
[09:54:02] <[mgw]> i mean, be iterative about it too... you'll probably want to treat it like a cache
[09:54:12] <[mgw]> but it's also probably an edge-case that someone will open 200 tooltips at one sitting
[09:54:37] <[mgw]> so it's not worth caring about initially
[09:55:05] <k2iguvahetaja> wat
[09:55:25] <ryanneufeld> k2iguvahetaja: have you seen danheberden's slides on deferreds?
[09:55:40] <ryanneufeld> k2iguvahetaja: he shows a really cool way to do ajax w/ caching
[09:56:03] <k2iguvahetaja> why I need caching?
[09:56:22] <ryanneufeld> k2iguvahetaja: if you have 30 items, you can get them all at once
[09:56:28] <[mgw]> if you have 1,000 markers... basically there are limitations to the amount of data you hold in the DOM at any given point
[09:56:29] <ryanneufeld> cache them user side as an object
[09:56:36] <ryanneufeld> and then pull them out as you need them
[09:56:54] <[mgw]> and gmaps will spit sugar at you if you pump too much on it
[09:57:06] <ryanneufeld> and only if one is missing do you do another ajax call
[09:57:10] <k2iguvahetaja> Im limiting it to a reasonable number
[09:57:21] <[mgw]> it's just a consideration is all
[09:57:27] <ryanneufeld> k2iguvahetaja: if that number is more than 1
[09:57:31] <ryanneufeld> k2iguvahetaja: then cache all the things
[09:57:45] <ryanneufeld> k2iguvahetaja: then you have all the data without having additional http round trips
[09:58:11] <k2iguvahetaja> Im doing only 1 request
[09:58:16] <k2iguvahetaja> even when I will have 50
[09:58:31] <zulax> i would like to keep the element in the dom eventhoug the div is replaced, so i tried ui.draggable.clone()
[09:58:40] <zulax> doesnt seem to work, how do i approach this
[09:59:01] <[mgw]> what?
[10:00:08] <ryanneufeld> zulax: use the helper
[10:00:38] <zulax> ryanneufeld, does that come preloaded with jq ui?
[10:00:50] <ryanneufeld> zulax: yes, read the docs
[10:00:55] <zulax> ok
[10:01:33] <[mgw]> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2218562/reload-dom-after-injecting-form-elements
[10:01:50] <[mgw]> sounds like my question's answer
[10:02:14] <ryanneufeld> [mgw]: yeah, I was gonna try and help you, then you called me a "fuck" and felt that would accomplish something
[10:02:52] <[mgw]> that's ok, Karma is a good concept
[10:03:13] <ryanneufeld> I've never seen you in here before, you must be new
[10:03:25] <[mgw]> kinda.
[10:04:23] <ryanneufeld> You'll find patience goes a long way 'round here. Also insulting people is usually not tolerated. There is no reason to be hostile if someone doesn't understand what you're saying.
[10:04:31] <[mgw]> sounds like "live" might help, but then i'm also cloning events
[10:04:32] <[mgw]> you're right
[10:04:51] <ryanneufeld> if you're using 1.7.x you want .on
[10:04:57] <ryanneufeld> ?on @ [mgw]
[10:04:58] <bot-t> [mgw], The new jQuery 1.7+ way of handling events: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:05:00] <[mgw]> but still doesn't explain why even me adding attributes don't seem reflected in the DOM
[10:05:29] <ryanneufeld> do you have a demo?
[10:05:38] <ryanneufeld> ?p
[10:05:39] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:06:38] <[mgw]> http://pastebin.com/9H0x9SrZ
[10:06:45] <[mgw]> whoops
[10:06:53] <zulax> ryanneufeld, $(this).draggable({helper:'clone'});
[10:06:58] <zulax> but i am not sure if its working
[10:07:14] <[mgw]> http://jsfiddle.net/rwScn/
[10:07:18] <ryanneufeld> zulax: you should see the original itme stay put
[10:07:38] <zulax> yes, my bad, had to do ui. and not this   - thank ryanneufeld
[10:07:40] <ryanneufeld> [mgw]: js goes in the bottom left
[10:08:03] <zulax> well, may be not
[10:08:35] <[mgw]> nice
[10:08:57] <ryanneufeld> [mgw]: did you know you can pass an object as data instead of building a string?
[10:09:52] <ryanneufeld> ?alert @ [mgw]
[10:09:52] <bot-t> [mgw], Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[10:10:08] <[mgw]> lol, yea i had heard that, i'm still old-skool... ought to upade
[10:10:25] <ryanneufeld> yeah, the thing about alert when working with ajax especially
[10:10:29] <ryanneufeld> is that it's blocking
[10:10:51] <ryanneufeld> so it can introduce race conditions, or hide them
[10:11:10] <ryanneufeld> I've seen it where it was hiding them, that was fun for the guy to figure out
[10:11:12] <[mgw]> gotcha, makes sense.  so any ideas on this?  is it some obscure issue that has nothing to do with this code at work?
[10:11:23] <ryanneufeld> [mgw]: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/rwScn/1/
[10:11:33] <ryanneufeld> well, i don't have enough context.
[10:11:36] <ryanneufeld> ?demo
[10:11:37] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[10:12:03] <ryanneufeld> can you get some html in there for context? maybe let me see where add_entry is getting called from?
[10:12:12] <ryanneufeld> I'm not sure I see what the problem is right now
[10:12:25] <[mgw]> aye, that's cool enough for me
[10:12:31] <[mgw]> thanks for being so helpful
[10:12:37] <[mgw]> reminds me how unique freenode is
[10:12:50] <[mgw]> just knowing i wasn't missing something blatant is enough
[10:12:51] <ryanneufeld> [mgw]: yeah, despite being called a 'fuck' ?
[10:13:03] <[mgw]> that's how i roll :)
[10:13:16] <[mgw]> i didn't eat enough soap as a boy
[10:13:50] <[mgw]> but thank you again
[10:14:09] <ryanneufeld> np
[10:14:23] <ryanneufeld> oh
[10:14:24] <ryanneufeld> dude
[10:14:27] <ryanneufeld> $(this)
[10:14:31] <ryanneufeld> what is it?
[10:14:42] <ryanneufeld> how are you calling add_entry?
[10:14:52] <ryanneufeld> is this the this you think it is?
[10:14:54] <[mgw]> so $(this) would be a sibling of the cloned obj
[10:15:01] <ryanneufeld> is it?
[10:15:02] <[mgw]> may not be! :)  worth checking
[10:15:10] <ryanneufeld> how are you calling add_entry?
[10:15:26] <[mgw]> so it's a todo list
[10:15:37] <[mgw]> basically you hit the button to add a task
[10:15:41] <[mgw]> the button is an <li> el
[10:15:50] <[mgw]> and then it adds a new <li> as a result
[10:15:52] <ryanneufeld> k, so how are you binding that click to call the add_entry?
[10:16:10] <zulax> i sorta got the clone work, but after cloning it doesnt call the next function
[10:16:11] <zulax> http://pastebin.com/10AayTHe
[10:16:11] <[mgw]> it gets bound as a result of that clone op
[10:16:17] <[mgw]> $(this).clone(true).appendTo($(this).parent());
[10:16:46] <[mgw]> hang on, let me at least screen shot
[10:16:58] <[mgw]> http://projects.mgwhitfield.com/todo.PNG
[10:17:22] <[mgw]> so you hit the blue bar, a new input gets placed at the bottom, then the blue bar itself is removed and re-added the list
[10:17:29] <[mgw]> re-added to the list* at the bottom once again
[10:17:30] <ryanneufeld> oh
[10:17:33] <ryanneufeld> why remove it?
[10:17:38] <ryanneufeld> why not just .before()
[10:17:42] <[mgw]> i just want it to goto the bottom
[10:17:46] <[mgw]> sec, looking that up :)
[10:17:54] <[mgw]> ignorance is probably the answer :P
[10:18:07] <[mgw]> oh nice :D
[10:18:15] <ryanneufeld> oh, also you're calling that code outside of your ajax call
[10:18:25] <ryanneufeld> so it's gonna happenbefore the ajax call is complete
[10:19:03] <ryanneufeld> chekc it
[10:19:04] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/rwScn/5/
[10:19:10] <ryanneufeld> I'ma school you sum
[10:19:14] <ryanneufeld> lol

[10:20:23] <gnarf> eh - its been a rough month for me
[10:20:34] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I hear you there
[10:20:38] <gnarf> haven't been around much in IRC

[10:21:15] <ryanneufeld> not fun
[10:21:40] <gnarf> holding down the #jquery? :)
[10:21:45] <ryanneufeld> and our ad trafficker was off for a week and some other CBS numbnutz fucked up all the ads
[10:21:53] <gnarf> oh at work
[10:21:56] <ryanneufeld> I'm pitchin in

[10:22:07] <ryanneufeld> oh lol
[10:22:10] <ryanneufeld> naw, I
[10:22:12] <Mkop> lol. I just accidentally created an infinite loop in HTML

[10:22:26] <Mkop> el.html(el)
[10:22:28] <ryanneufeld> lot's a noobs since the jq summit
[10:22:28] <gnarf> Mkop: that makes no sense
[10:22:40] <gnarf> Mkop: .html() != HTML :)
[10:22:41] <ryanneufeld> Mkop: that would be a dom loop

[10:23:53] <ryanneufeld> Zerpex: you mean an image carousel?
[10:24:22] <zulax> would smthg like this work to clone a object,  ui.draggable().clone().appendTo(document.body);
[10:24:43] <Zerpex> something like that ajpiano linked :O
[10:24:46] <ryanneufeld> zulax: what is it that you're trying to do?
[10:24:53] <minna> How do i put a variable within a json call? Example: "itemId":"0", "quantity": myvar, "someThing": 2,
[10:25:12] <minna> All that get's output is the text myvar
[10:25:15] <[mgw]> um fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
[10:25:27] <ryanneufeld> [mgw]: ?
[10:25:31] <[mgw]> the DOM is the most tedious PoS one sould ever cross paths with :)
[10:25:31] <minna> ?
[10:25:43] <minna> no
[10:25:48] <minna> I love the DOM
[10:25:53] <[mgw]> reaaaaaaly?
[10:25:56] <minna> Yeah :)
[10:26:04] <zulax> ryanneufeld, i can drag a class and drop it into a box, after that i want to keep the copy of the dropped class and regenerate 4 new classes
[10:26:08] <[mgw]> it pays the bills or something?, lol :)
[10:26:12] <Anime> is there a way to iterate through some results like this: $("#someid")[0], [1], etc..?
[10:26:29] <Anime> not with this syntax though, just tried
[10:26:31] <ryanneufeld> zulax:  you mean elements?
[10:26:36] <minna> No, i'm a masochist :-D
[10:26:40] <ryanneufeld> [mgw]: it pays mine quite well
[10:26:44] <[mgw]> haha :)
[10:26:50] <zulax> yes ryanneufeld
[10:26:51] <ryanneufeld> [mgw]: problem?
[10:26:52] <[mgw]> well i'm glad part of it is you being so helpful
[10:27:02] <[mgw]> well so it's just that attribute stuff
[10:27:10] <[mgw]> from that code paste: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/rwScn/5/
[10:27:18] <minna> Anyone?
[10:27:29] <[mgw]> i update the objects ID attrib, and it gets reflected properly.  then in a later event callback, it doesn't seem to reflect that ID
[10:27:32] <minna> Maybe "+myvar+" ??
[10:27:41] <[mgw]> i don't know if it's because i do $.clone(true) orrrrr
[10:27:45] <gnarf> oh hey ajpiano - yer turn in WWF :)
[10:27:52] <[mgw]> it's as though it's referencing a completely diff part of the DOM
[10:28:01] <gnarf> left you with the triple word option :/
[10:28:16] <ajpiano> gnarf: haha i know, after all, i get *two* notifications every time you play
[10:28:17] <minna> Nah, that didnt work
[10:28:22] <gnarf> two?
[10:28:27] <ajpiano> yea bro
[10:28:30] <gnarf> strange
[10:28:33] <gnarf> why?
[10:28:34] <ajpiano> don't click that button in FB that's like, let them know it's their turn
[10:28:46] <ajpiano> otherwise your opponent gets both the normal wwf notification AND an FB notification
[10:28:52] <gnarf> ahh
[10:28:53] <gnarf> apologies
[10:28:55] <ryanneufeld> [mgw]: can you get a working demo setup on jsfiddle?
[10:28:58] <ryanneufeld> wwf?
[10:29:01] <gnarf> i think it might be on auto
[10:29:05] <gnarf> words with friends
[10:29:07] <ryanneufeld> ooh
[10:29:09] <ajpiano> it's ok :p
[10:29:12] <[mgw]> i mean, fffuck i'm more a biz guy than ya'll i think
[10:29:13] <ryanneufeld> I wanna play!
[10:29:16] <[mgw]> can i PM you a linkee?
[10:29:20] <minna> Hm, '+ myvar + ' seem to work
[10:29:30] <[mgw]> i protect my moldy cheese
[10:29:37] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: i think im just "gnarf"
[10:29:39] <ajpiano> gnarf: i think you'll manage to pull through no matter what
[10:29:40] <ajpiano> :p
[10:29:45] <Zerpex> ajpiano: is that the only one u know?
[10:29:47] <gnarf> ajpiano: yeah, two bingos on that game?
[10:29:55] <ryanneufeld> [mgw]: I'm at work at the moment man
[10:30:01] <[mgw]> i hear ya
[10:30:05] <[mgw]> i'll figure it out lol
[10:30:11] <ajpiano> yep
[10:30:17] <[mgw]> i was in here a few months back trying to write a plugin, ajpiano helped me
[10:30:19] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: you must not be in the US
[10:30:21] <[mgw]> similar ****
[10:30:26] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: nope
[10:30:29] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: :)
[10:30:31] <[mgw]> it is always some obscure BS answer
[10:30:35] <ajpiano> and i've been sitting on terrible racks all game, that's why my opening was so mediocre
[10:30:36] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: vancouver canada
[10:30:59] <gnarf> ajpiano: i hate that - my mom beat me cuz of a bad rack for like 5 turns
[10:31:11] <ajpiano> i was in full on rage mode last night,
[10:31:23] <ajpiano> gnarf: http://oksoclap.com/racks
[10:31:31] <ajpiano> that was a game i played last night
[10:31:53] <gnarf> shitty
[10:32:17] <[mgw]> i think you're correct with the $.on stufff being my answer ryanneufeld
[10:32:30] <ajpiano> i don't mind shitty racks, i just get annoyed when you try to actually balance your rack and just keep getting shit
[10:32:30] <gnarf> ajpiano: i am "gnarf" on wwf right?
[10:32:35] <[mgw]> my guess is that the DOM is playing /fiddling with old events in the DOM
[10:32:42] <gnarf> ?twss
[10:32:43] <bot-t> <iainvdw> was fiddling with it for a while, got close a few times, but didn't do exaclty what i wanted, thx!
[10:32:45] <ajpiano> you should up as Corey Fr.. in mine
[10:32:49] <[mgw]> rather than staying on the toes
[10:32:50] <gnarf> oh
[10:32:52] <gnarf> um
[10:32:52] <Mkop> $("whatever").each() is non-blocking, right?
[10:33:03] <[mgw]> i'm gonna go smell the turkey, brb
[10:33:26] <[mgw]> <3 you guys
[10:33:31] <zulax> after an element is dropped, i wanted to make a copy of it at the same place , tried this but also doesnt work:                          $('body').append(ui.draggable());
[10:33:36] <gnarf> Mkop: non-blocking?
[10:33:45] <[mgw]> jquery people rock - of all the tech crowds i've witnessed, jquery peeps are the coolest, by far
[10:33:59] <Mkop> the line of code after the .each() will execute immediately without waiting for the .each() to execute
[10:34:09] <gnarf> Mkop: no it wont
[10:34:12] <[mgw]> games peeps are pretty sweet too :), d'wahhhhh
[10:34:14] <gnarf> Mkop: it executes the loop
[10:34:21] <gnarf> Mkop: then the line after
[10:34:24] <ryanneufeld> I gotta get back to work guys
[10:34:28] <ryanneufeld> [mgw]: good luck
[10:35:06] <gnarf> Mkop: but thats not "non-blocking" anyway --- all JS "blocks" something
[10:37:03] <especially-corn> does addClass check if the class is already there? or does it moronically add the same class over and over
[10:37:17] <ryanneufeld> especially-corn: did you try it?
[10:38:03] <especially-corn> ryanneufeld, no, i stopped doing stuff by trying it
[10:38:13] <ryanneufeld> especially-corn: well, try it and see
[10:38:43] <especially-corn> ryanneufeld, it might work here but i'm not sure if it will work somewhere else
[10:39:01] <NoiseEee> like in egypt or something?
[10:39:55] <ryanneufeld> More like an uncomfortable place
[10:40:02] <gnarf> especially-corn: thats really easy to test
[10:40:11] <ajpiano> especially-corn: what part of your experience with jquery leads you to believe that methods work one way "in one place" and work differently "in other places"
[10:40:46] <especially-corn> ajpiano, accordion works on my chromium 15 but not on firefox 3.4.1
[10:40:55] <ajpiano> oh that's cool
[10:40:58] <especially-corn> a part of it
[10:41:01] <ajpiano> there's never even ever been a firefox 3.4
[10:41:07] <gnarf> heh
[10:41:13] <gnarf> vaporware?
[10:41:18] <especially-corn> ajpiano, well i don't use firefox 3.4 but people do
[10:41:22] <ajpiano> no
[10:41:26] <gnarf> especially-corn: no they dont
[10:41:27] <ajpiano> no one ever uses firefox 3.4
[10:41:43] <ajpiano> it was never released
[10:41:50] * gnarf is getting strange looks from the family as i giggle at this conversation
[10:41:57] <especially-corn> ajpiano, my school uses firefox 3.4
[10:42:07] <ajpiano> is your school in an alternate universe?
[10:42:15] <ajpiano> there was never a version of firefox 3.4 released
[10:42:24] <especially-corn> ajpiano, it's 3.???
[10:42:27] <especially-corn> i think its 3.4
[10:42:27] <gnarf> http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/questions/874552
[10:42:29] <ajpiano> 3.5, 3.6
[10:42:36] <ajpiano> but they skipped over 1 2 3 4
[10:42:39] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: that would explain why it doesn't work in 3.4.1 though
[10:42:45] <especially-corn> well its probably 3.6
[10:42:48] <especially-corn> i dont know its 3. something
[10:43:21] <ajpiano> especially-corn: you'd be well served to learn the difference between a complex ui widget perhaps havings slightly different behaviours in different browsers
[10:43:27] <ajpiano> than like, the functoinality of a very atomic method
[10:43:30] <ajpiano> like addClass
[10:44:25] <Bartmax> how to save a jquery obj for later user
[10:44:29] <Bartmax> something like :
[10:44:50] <ajpiano> var foo = $("#foo")
[10:45:11] <Bartmax> that could be inside an obj ?
[10:45:14] <ajpiano> you can also click the floppy disk icon
[10:45:22] <ajpiano> yes.
[10:45:32] <Bartmax> something like Foo = { foo = $('#foo') } ?
[10:45:40] <ajpiano> nope
[10:45:46] <Bartmax> how ?
[10:45:59] <ajpiano> the same syntax you use for every single other thing you put in an object
[10:46:09] <ajpiano> var foo = { bar: "baz", bang: $(".bang") }
[10:46:12] <Bartmax> Foo = { foo : $('#foo') } ?
[10:46:19] <Bartmax> ok, then.. why isn't working? :D
[10:46:23] <Bartmax> hahaha
[10:46:28] <Bartmax> i thought i was doing it wrong
[10:46:31] <gnarf> Bartmax: that selection is made at the time of the object
[10:46:34] <ajpiano> don't use an uppercase letter to denote a plain object
[10:46:35] <gnarf> creation
[10:46:39] <ajpiano> ^^
[10:46:57] <gnarf> so like - if the html isn't loaded yet (like the script is in the head) the #foo might not be in the dom
[10:47:09] <Bartmax> im on ready event
[10:47:31] <gnarf> other than that, there are a few reasons it might not work, but it would be best if you could give us a demo - see ?demo
[10:47:31] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[10:47:58] <ajpiano> btw gnarf, did you see ?10884
[10:48:00] <bot-t> ajpiano, Timeline  jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - http://bugs.jquery.com/timeline
[10:48:16] <ajpiano> ?10884
[10:48:18] <bot-t> ajpiano, Timeline  jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - http://bugs.jquery.com/timeline
[10:48:20] <gnarf> delete
[10:48:21] <gnarf> d
[10:48:23] <ajpiano> wtf
[10:48:25] <ajpiano> who deleted it
[10:48:26] <gnarf> was that the "EEEEESH" one?
[10:48:35] <ajpiano> yeah
[10:48:39] <ajpiano> i had tagged it jqueries
[10:48:39] <ajpiano> :/
[10:48:40] <gnarf> yeah - saw it
[10:48:42] <ajpiano> i wanted to perform it
[10:48:54] <gnarf> i have the email still
[10:48:55] <gnarf> :)
[10:48:58] <ajpiano> me too, good point
[10:50:15] <Bartmax> http://jsfiddle.net/vVR6W/1/
[10:50:43] <especially-corn> can anyone tell me what's wrong with this code? http://paste.ubuntu.com/748500/ it's not adding the error class
[10:51:07] <gulli> Hey!
[10:51:13] <gnarf> Bartmax: http://jsfiddle.net/vVR6W/2/
[10:51:22] <gulli> Im trying to pass into an array from json, could someone give me tips
[10:51:33] <gulli> http://pastebin.com/8S0nL2JK
[10:51:39] <gulli> You can see the json code on the bottom, the edited out text works
[10:51:43] <Bartmax> duh! thanks gnarf
[10:51:54] <gulli> but Im trying to pash the json into the array
[10:52:08] <gnarf> ummm
[10:52:15] <gnarf> gulli: whats wrong with data = data ?
[10:52:17] <gnarf>  :)
[10:52:20] <gulli> and there is one ; missing there, but still it dosent work
[10:52:22] <gulli> ;
[10:52:29] <gnarf> or rather d1=data
[10:52:58] <gulli> woops, its supposede to be key, i tried that though
[10:53:11] <gnarf> or are you trying to collapse [ {a:1,b:2} ] into [ [1,2] ]
[10:53:12] <gnarf> ?
[10:53:57] <gulli> yes, basically [ {a:1, b:2}] -> [ [1,2]]
[10:53:57] <gnarf> also, you'll never have data in that plot call since the ajax call is async - the "result" function never will be called before you call the plot
[10:54:35] <gnarf> ?js $.map( [{"a":"4","b":"1"},{"a":"5","b":"2"},{"a":"8","b":"3"},{"a":"7","b":"4"},{"a":"6","b":"5"},{"a":"8","b":"6"}], function( elem ) { return [[ elem.a, elem.b ]]; })
[10:54:35] <bot-t> gnarf: [["4", "1"], ["5", "2"], ["8", "3"], ["7", "4"], ["6", "5"], ["8", "6"]]
[10:54:50] <gnarf> ^ @gulli
[10:54:55] <gulli> yeah, id use $(document).ready(function()
[10:55:09] <gnarf> just put the plot in the callback from the getJSON
[10:55:36] <gulli> thecallback? hmm
[10:55:48] <gnarf> but gulli - i'd prolly make my server respond with the json in the correct formant
[10:55:53] <gnarf> but you can easily .map it
[10:58:01] <Bartmax> can i save a function and use the saved obj on that function ? http://jsfiddle.net/vVR6W/3/
[10:59:59] <terrysutton> Hi All:  I'm confused about a basic function. I want to test if I'm logged into WordPress and then apply some CSS if I am.  Seems like the easiest way is to just check if the body hasClass "logged-in"
[10:59:59] <terrysutton> I just can't figure out how to make it into a function
[11:00:05] <terrysutton> $(document).ready(function () {
[11:00:06] <terrysutton> 	if $('body').hasClass("logged-in"){
[11:00:06] <terrysutton> 		$("menu-top").css('top', '25px')
[11:00:06] <terrysutton> 	}
[11:00:06] <terrysutton>  });
[11:00:16] <ryanneufeld> wtf, meno is a word!
[11:00:42] <gnarf> foodie?
[11:00:55] <ajpiano> yea
[11:01:00] <gnarf> :)
[11:01:01] <ajpiano> like, people who are into food
[11:01:04] <gnarf> yeah
[11:01:12] <ajpiano> my rack was terribs
[11:01:26] <ryanneufeld> I keep getting all vowels
[11:01:37] <terrysutton> I should have put that code into a JSBin:   http://jsbin.com/ebibod/2/edit#javascript,html
[11:01:51] <ajpiano> welcome to the party
[11:02:35] <gnarf> i wonder if i can break 500 in this game ajpiano
[11:02:53] <ajpiano> i hope not :X
[11:04:17] <zulax> can i not do append for an array item? $('#question-div').html(myQset[0]);
[11:04:29] <zulax> just doesnt show anything if i have an array var there
[11:04:55] <gnarf> ajpiano: so sad i didnt have an S :/
[11:05:14] <ajpiano> my heart goes out to you
[11:06:56] <zulax> if i make a regular var like myQset0 then append works, but not for [0]
[11:07:26] <ajpiano> zulax: there is no such rule like that
[11:07:38] <ajpiano> if an expression returns a valid method, it doesn't matter whether it's in an array or not
[11:08:02] <ajpiano> i heartily recommend debugging your code instead of making up tall tales about what's happening
[11:08:02] <amirite> cough
[11:08:16] <ajpiano> a valid value*
[11:08:23] <bloops> is there a nifty selector for .text() == "something" or contains "something"?
[11:08:35] <ajpiano> no
[11:09:10] <bloops> ajpiano: was that an answer to my question?
[11:09:17] <gnarf> ?contains selector
[11:09:18] <bot-t> gnarf, :contains() Selector - Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[11:09:37] <ajpiano> bloops: $("foo").filter( function() { var t = $(this).text();  return ~t.indexOf("something");  } );
[11:09:39] <ajpiano> bloops: yes
[11:10:00] <gnarf> ajpiano: ~ is such a lovely "hack"
[11:10:07] <bloops> ajpiano: ah! thanks
[11:11:29] <cgiGeek> morning, need to hire some one to fix one .post, anyone available ? <----job offer
[11:11:45] <ajpiano> gnarf: it's the best.
[11:12:06] <cgiGeek> thanks ajpiano, need someone now tho
[11:12:06] <bloops> gnarf: no, I wanted to select the immediate text attribute being my desired string. contains would select those whose children have the text too, right?
[11:12:18] <cgiGeek> ohh
[11:12:20] <ajpiano> cgiGeek: what about my reply made you think ....
[11:12:23] <gnarf> bloops: .text() gets text from children too :)
[11:12:33] <cgiGeek> my bad ajpiano
[11:12:46] <bloops> gnarf: oh seriously?
[11:12:53] <gnarf> cgiGeek: good luck - maybe you should state more about it :)
[11:12:59] <bloops> gnarf: I didn't realise that.
[11:13:39] <bloops> ajpiano: thanks. its similar to what I wrote. I was wondering whether there is a cleaner way...
[11:13:53] <terrysutton> Hey Guys, this is a simple Fiddle of the hasClass conundrum have.  Maybe I can't use hasClass in this way?    http://jsfiddle.net/v4CDx/
[11:15:03] <gnarf> terrysutton: http://jsfiddle.net/v4CDx/1/ works fine after you fix the syntax error
[11:15:08] <gnarf> the missing () around the if
[11:15:31] <gnarf> terrysutton: you should look at the console for errors before posting when possible :)
[11:16:42] <terrysutton> Thanks gnarf: very much.  The console just gave me this error:   http://cl.ly/3F3k1q1S2M1W3C420f0c    Does that tell me anything about the missing brackets?
[11:16:57] <ajpiano> yes
[11:17:08] <ajpiano> it tells you that it encountered some character where it didn't expect to find it
[11:17:18] <ajpiano> in this case, it found anything besides a ( after the word "if"
[11:17:44] <gnarf> it also told you the line it happened on
[11:17:52] <gnarf> and since its a syntax error
[11:18:01] <gnarf> ....
[11:18:07] <ajpiano> terrysutton: step debugging your code and looking at the errors it produces is a vastly superior approach to "making up stories about potential things happening in your code"
[11:18:40] <Bartmax> ajpiano: if i save the object as var foo = $('#foo')
[11:18:43] <terrysutton> gnarf: ajpiano:  I guess the real issue is that I don't know how to read that error output
[11:18:50] <Bartmax> later the foo.val() will change if it's an input and user change it's value ?
[11:18:55] <gnarf> "syntax error line #"
[11:19:02] <gnarf> go fix your bad syntax
[11:19:04] <gnarf> thats what that means
[11:19:05] <ajpiano> Bartmax: no it won't
[11:19:18] <terrysutton> I don't see what line the syntax error was on
[11:19:20] <gnarf> ajpiano: yes, it will
[11:19:25] <ajpiano> Bartmax: the reason your code wasn't working before is because you can't set the 'text' of an element to be 'a juqery collection'
[11:19:37] <ajpiano> oh, yes
[11:19:38] <gnarf> if you have a ref to "foo" and foo.val() will be the value of the input when it is executed
[11:19:38] <ajpiano> that will work
[11:19:59] <Bartmax> i'm trying to avoid scaning the DOM everytime ...
[11:20:07] <Chopps> can someone tell me why this isnt working http://jsfiddle.net/hfxc2/ basically what i want to do is make the text area 150px height when focus
[11:20:19] <ajpiano> i thought he was asking if, if he saved it in an object, and then used that to get the element'stext, and then put that text somewhere else, and then changed the value, would the place where the text was magically change
[11:20:22] <Bartmax> but i get the first value not the 'changed' values.. i don't know whats going on with me today... :(
[11:20:43] <RoosterJuice> anyone here use jeditable?
[11:21:13] <ajpiano> you have a syntax error in your code
[11:21:13] <RoosterJuice> i just want to know if there's a way to change the default "click to edit" message.  Any help would be appreciated.
[11:21:27] <ajpiano> Chopps: use a debugger
[11:21:35] <Bartmax> I want to avoid scanning the dom, and i dont want to clutter the namespace with vars. is that possible ?
[11:22:01] <ajpiano> what is "the namespace"
[11:22:31] <ajpiano> Bartmax: you shouldn't be afraid to ... use variables
[11:22:53] <ajpiano> Chopps: http://jsfiddle.net/hfxc2/1/
[11:22:54] <Bartmax> there are lots of js around
[11:22:59] <ajpiano> lol
[11:23:05] <gnarf> Bartmax: variables rule - they only exist inside the function context :)
[11:24:05] <Bartmax> but if I do inside a function, it will travel the dom everytime i call that funciton. something im missing BADLY.
[11:24:09] <Bartmax> i used to know how to js :(
[11:24:12] <Chopps> ajpiano, thank you :D
[11:24:40] <ajpiano> somehow i feel like this is relevant http://fixee.org/paste/5hcfmac/
[11:24:53] <gnarf> Bartmax: var myfunc = (function() { var ref = $("#foo"); return function() { return foo.val() }; })(); :)
[11:25:22] <gnarf> how is closaure formed
[11:25:22] <gnarf> heh
[11:25:33] <gnarf> reminds me of peenmeeter.com
[11:25:55] <gnarf> s/meeter/meter
[11:26:53] <Bartmax> gnarf: mmm let me see, i think that's what i needed :D
[11:26:54] <ajpiano> lol the one with two e's is for a different kind of meeting
[11:27:26] <gnarf> Bartmax: so like - just cuz you can make a closure doesn't mean you should
[11:27:47] <gnarf> it takes up extra time/memory to have unnessecary closures
[11:27:53] <Bartmax> gnarf: ok
[11:28:59] <ajpiano> BUT NOT AS MUCH AS SUPERFLUOUS DOM QUERIES
[11:31:19] <Bartmax> gnarf: how to call an inside function from outside ?
[11:31:24] <Bartmax> like myfunc.Calculate()
[11:32:01] <gnarf> huh?
[11:32:16] <Bartmax> can i have a function inside myfunc ?
[11:32:32] <gnarf> functions can have other functions as properties - yes
[11:32:41] <Bartmax> how to call it ?
[11:32:46] <Bartmax> myfunc.myinsidefunction() ?
[11:32:54] <gnarf> if you were doing that
[11:33:08] <gnarf> this is all way too theoretical
[11:33:13] <gnarf> for me to finish that sentance
[11:33:57] <Bartmax> damn i dont see what im doing wrong...
[11:34:04] <Bartmax> but i feel like rewritting js :D
[11:34:17] <Bartmax> too many months with only C#
[11:34:27] <juha_> i like our new office, just slept an hour on the hallway because i didn't know lock combination :D well deserved nap
[11:34:36] <ajpiano> Bartmax: you can only call functions that are properties (methods) of the object you have access to
[11:34:41] <ajpiano> Bartmax: you should read about the module pattern
[11:34:48] <ajpiano> ?g ben cherry module pattern
[11:34:49] <bot-t> ajpiano, Adequately Good - JavaScript Module Pattern: In-Depth - by Ben ... - http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/3/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth
[11:34:58] <Bartmax> thxs ajpiano
[11:35:03] <ajpiano> and allow gnarf to enjoy his thanksgiving instead of explaining js design patterns and basic concepts of privacy
[11:35:08] <ajpiano> vs public
[11:35:36] <gnarf> thx piano
[11:37:19] <juha_> i visited the macys thanksgiving parade, lot's of people

[11:43:28] <Bartmax> ajpiano: BEAUTIFULL!! THanks... module pattern yes that was what i need to read
[11:43:29] <Bartmax> :D
[11:43:47] <ajpiano> HOORY GIVE THANKS, IT'S #JQUERY
[11:44:00] <Bartmax> sorry gnarf
[11:44:07] <Bartmax> for bothering ya
[11:44:45] <Hopsy> What do you expect from volunteering at the VUmc and do you have an idea of what kind of job you would want?
[11:45:06] <Hopsy> how should i answer this question xd

[11:46:07] <Hopsy> uhu, they will never accept me then
[11:50:00] <juha_> sure they will, you are a person with straight forward motivation and passion
[11:55:40] <Anime> http://jsfiddle.net/88gkC/ - i'm trying to load an image (with an ajax load overlay) which will be set to many positions (described by the pos array) in the list. could someone point me what i'm missing?
[11:59:28] <hever> Hello, I'm simply going to call an js gallery image view (thickbox) by triggering an click event but that doesn't work. Do you have any idea how I can trigger a click event that would ortherwise be called by onclick? I mean I need to be "this" available...
[12:02:08] <ziggles> Hi, i was wondering if anyone could help me with an issue I'm having with jQuery height()
[12:03:06] <Bartmax> 	is there a better way of doing this : return parseInt(value * 100,10) / 100; ?
[12:05:10] <pmb_> Could anyone recommend me a good query book that isn't just a cookbook?
[12:05:54] <Bartmax> ? $.map
[12:05:55] <bot-t> Bartmax, .map() - Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[12:09:13] <JakeSays> so.. what is a $.Deferred()?
[12:12:17] <juha_> ajpiano: we're flying on tuesday
[12:12:30] <gnarf> JakeSays: see ?deferred
[12:12:31] <bot-t> JakeSays, http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[12:13:01] <gnarf> Bartmax: umm... paresInt( value * 100 ) doesn't make a lot of sense
[12:13:09] <gnarf> since *100 implies a cast to number anyway
[12:14:44] <Bartmax> x =50.32432432 * 100; x = 5032.432432;  parseInt(x) = 5032 ; x/100 = 50.32
[12:14:58] <Bartmax> i have 12.3456789 and i want 12.34
[12:15:08] <JakeSays> gnarf: hmm. deferred is one of those features that can be very handy or amazingly evil.
[12:15:21] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: you're killing me here lol

[12:19:18] <Corinna> Okie dokie
[12:20:16] <k1ng> what would be the bestway to check if checkbox already has the value?
[12:20:21] <k1ng> best way*
[12:20:45] <Bartmax> define best way. I like .is(':checked')
[12:20:53] <k1ng> no
[12:20:57] <k1ng> if value="1"
[12:21:13] <Bartmax> .val() == 1 ?
[12:21:21] <k1ng> so many of them
[12:21:46] <Bartmax> so many of what ?
[12:21:49] <k1ng> .val() only get one
[12:22:04] <k1ng> http://puu.sh/9ghu
[12:22:05] <TofuTurkey> having problems capturing the form fields via serialize to .post via a .click(), form posts, but no data in serialize , any ideas on how to debug this nightmare.
[12:22:40] <Bartmax> checkbox[key="1"].length > 0
[12:22:49] <Bartmax> sorry
[12:22:51] <k1ng> and the checkbox going to be array
[12:22:59] <k1ng> name="key[]"
[12:23:29] <Bartmax> $('input[value="1"]').length
[12:23:51] <Bartmax> $('input[name="key"][value="1"]').length
[12:23:56] <Bartmax> not sure if the last works
[12:24:01] <TofuTurkey> BartMax, checking, thanks.
[12:24:13] <k1ng> Bartmax, name="key[]"
[12:24:17] <k1ng> will it work?
[12:25:01] <Bartmax> k1ng: if it's going to be an array you can use ? $.map
[12:25:02] <bot-t> k1ng, .map() - Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[12:25:14] <dabear> k1ng: If you wish to use any of the meta-characters ( such as !"#$%&'()*+,./:;<=>?@[\]^`{|}~ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\. For example, if you have an element with id="foo.bar", you can use the selector $("#foo\\.bar")
[12:25:19] <dabear> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[12:25:44] <TofuTurkey> BartMax,k1ng, it wont go that far I added a hidden field to the form nothing gets posted when I use the .click to post
[12:26:25] <TofuTurkey> I am guessing I am serializing either the wrong name or int he wrong place
[12:26:50] <k1ng>  $('input[name="key"][value="1"]').length works :D
[12:27:01] <Bartmax> k1ng: it's not fast...
[12:27:07] <TofuTurkey> the form id is files, $.post('/phpsecret.php' , $("#files").serialize(), function( data ) { nothing gets passed
[12:27:12] <gnarf> Bartmax: [value="whatever"] doesn't update with user input btw
[12:27:12] <Bartmax> so be sure not calling it 1000000 times :D
[12:27:28] <k1ng> its checkbox :D
[12:27:33] <k1ng> :S
[12:27:42] <Bartmax> right
[12:27:43] <gnarf> oh sure- use [value=] then
[12:27:48] <k1ng> maybe its will run 1000 time
[12:27:49] <gnarf> missed the checkbox part
[12:27:57] <gnarf> classes are faster tho
[12:27:58] <k1ng> well more than 10000
[12:28:23] <k1ng>  $('.keys[value="11"]').length
[12:28:25] <k1ng> like this?
[12:28:35] <k1ng> its works :D
[12:28:51] <gnarf> yeah - better than [name="key[]
[12:28:54] <gnarf> or whatev
[12:28:56] <Bartmax> way better
[12:29:51] <TofuTurkey> basically i cannot capture any fields values when i use .click to post not serializing, not directly passing them
[12:30:32] <TofuTurkey> n
[12:30:44] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: bad racks?
[12:30:56] <ryanneufeld> terrible

[13:14:24] <pierrooo> ?
[13:15:38] <especially-corn> can anyone tell me why the checkForm doesn't return false if a class has bad? http://paste.ubuntu.com/748647/
[13:23:22] <quizme> how do you selectively delegate clicks to different sub elements ?
[13:25:07] <quizme> <ul id='flavor'><li><span class='name'>Vanilla</span><span class='delete'>x</span></li></ul>  <--- sometimes I want the user to be able to remove the flavor from the list, and sometimes I want them to select the flavor.
[13:26:29] <quizme> $('#flavor').delegate('li', 'click', function(){ // do stuff });
[13:32:27] <minna> can i use an if statement to activate different variable content for a variable of same name?
[13:34:58] <Lety93> ciao
[13:40:06] <minna> someone+
[13:45:12] <aca20031> Anyone think of a non-canvas way to draw a path on a map (like showing the path someone took by drawing rectangles)? Atm I put a transparent animated gif over the map, but then you cant click on pieces of the map underneath which is annoying.
[13:45:21] <aca20031> furthermore firefox caches it and wont replay the animation
[13:46:28] <SaadIbrahim> guys i am using qtip plugin.. just need to know if theres a way to hide the previous tooltip when a new one shows up
[13:55:21] <Anime> http://pastebin.com/hUGA8QSZ is there anything wrong with this? it always even though the correct url is being called
[13:55:54] <Anime> it always fails*
[14:01:39] <andrew9183> can web designers make $100k?
[14:02:10] <Phlunk3> of course...
[14:02:22] <Phlunk3> that said, so can dog walkers.
[14:03:19] <andrew9183> lol
[14:03:23] <aca20031> i suppose you could make that if you ran your own business or if you did hard new web apps instead of basic web designs
[14:03:40] <aca20031> e.g. if you designed google maps, im sure you'd be set :)
[14:08:22] <ragas> dog walkers really can make big$$
[14:08:55] <ragas> its all just about getting the gith clients
[14:12:00] <emkei> Hello all
[14:12:11] <Aradiv> hello emkei
[14:12:47] <Alex82> hello :)
[14:13:09] <emkei> have a quick question why nivo slider use var NivoSlider and $.fn.nivoSlider()
[14:13:32] <emkei> why they do not fit everything just in $fn.nivoslider ?
[14:14:34] <Alex82> I tested this and it does print undefined . How can i print the object properties ? http://jsfiddle.net/KgEEK/1/
[14:16:51] <TofuTurkey> got it working thank guys in the 'name[]' : value the required [] is not really obvious , thank you
[14:19:51] <emkei> ok to the question above just to be sure NivoSlider uses namespacing?
[14:23:06] <emkei> also if I'm using jquery ui methods like buttons and dialogs should I extend it as jquery plugin or as jquery ui widget
[14:23:27] <emkei> these are the questions after crunching couple of books about jquery
[14:23:34] <emkei> in couple days
[14:38:57] <yedimind> say i have 2 arrays, and they contain values that might be duplicated information, what would be the most efficient way to pull out two arrays out of those two one that contains all replicated items, and one that contains all unique items
[14:39:32] <yedimind> i thought about iterating through one array and nest another iteration through the 2nd array and matching, and tracking, but it's really inefficient when dealing with several thousand items in the array
[14:39:44] <yedimind> and also need to do it in both directions (array1 might have items array2 doesnt, and vice versa)
[14:39:49] <J0rrod> anyone uses maxmind geoip?
[14:43:22] <dabear> yedimind: download underscore.js
[14:44:17] <yedimind> ...
[14:44:24] <yedimind> why? lol
[14:44:30] <dabear> ?
[14:44:37] <Alex82> Hi! i was trying to build an app with HTML 5, JS storing to localStorage. It does save the js object to localStorage but why ListNotes() does print undefined? How can i print the object properties ? http://jsfiddle.net/KgEEK/1/
[14:45:02] <yedimind> i dont blindly include entire libraries because it may or may not have one single function i need
[14:45:04] <dabear> yedimind: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#zip and also see uniq
[14:45:12] <yedimind> i asked in here so that i can talk to someone through the process
[14:45:15] <yedimind> and try to understand it
[14:45:23] <yedimind> i already found underscore.js by googling
[14:45:32] <dabear> array manipulation is _somewhat_ out of scope of what jquery does
[14:47:06] <iksik> yedimind, http://phpjs.org/functions/array_unique:346
[14:47:06] <iksik> ;]
[14:47:16] <iksik> and plenty other usefull/or not functions
[14:47:35] <hdon_> hi all :) can anyone tell me how to remove a .live() handler?
[14:47:46] <dabear> ?die @ hdon_
[14:47:47] <bot-t> hdon_, .die(): Remove all event handlers previously attached using .live() from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/die/
[14:47:57] <hdon_> dabear: that rmeoves *all* .live9) handlers :(
[14:48:07] <yedimind> do i need to elaborate on what im trying to do? i don't want to sound ungreatful but none of these solutions is actually what i need
[14:48:11] <yedimind> im not checking for replication in a single array
[14:48:16] <yedimind> duplication even
[14:48:25] <dabear> iksik: I have used several functions from phpjs and let's just say I have mixed experiences
[14:48:38] <yedimind> and the array_unique does exactly what i said i dont want to do
[14:48:55] * hdon_ reads yedimind's chats
[14:49:09] <iksik> yedimind, http://phpjs.org/functions/array_intersect:318
[14:49:22] <iksik> or other array_intersect_*
[14:49:29] <iksik> or http://phpjs.org/functions/array_diff:309
[14:49:35] <iksik> just to get an idea
[14:49:38] <dabear>  you said "and one that contains all unique items"
[14:49:46] <quizme> does .remove remove sub elements too ?
[14:49:51] <quizme> recursively ?
[14:49:52] <dabear> and now you say you didn't say you wanted unique items :S
[14:49:56] <razzi> yedimind, what is the type of the values?
[14:49:57] <dabear> -ed
[14:50:06] <iksik> dabear, same here... i'm just watching a solutions 'how they do that' ;)
[14:50:14] <hdon_> yedimind: .indexOf() might be faster, until the JIT kicks in and then it's probably only as fast. you *can* get b-tree optimization by storing your values as keys, but if your values are non-primitive (Objects) then you can't make them keys
[14:50:22] <hdon_> (in Javascript keys are called Property Names)
[14:50:31] <yedimind> Array1 and Array2, need to be processed to create array3 and array4, array3 will contain single instances of all duplicate items between Array1 and Array2, and Array4 will contain all unique instances in both Array1 and Array2
[14:50:34] <quizme> nm
[14:50:45] <quizme> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1113982/jquery-question-does-using-remove-also-properly-remove-children
[14:50:49] <razzi> nevermind, i was gonna say what hdon said
[14:50:59] <yedimind> razzi, in this case, the values contain geo coordinates
[14:51:06] <yedimind> and there are ~1.5million records between the two arrays
[14:51:14] <gnarf> yedimind: so you want the intersection in the first array and the diff in the second?
[14:51:19] <yedimind> so i can (with relative ease) setup 3 for loops
[14:51:33] <yedimind> but its extremely inefficient for this large a dataset
[14:51:36] <Danny_x> put values as keys and do it in 1 loop and construct  2 arrays in that loop
[14:51:38] <dabear> ?die @ hdon_
[14:51:39] <bot-t> hdon_, .die(): Remove all event handlers previously attached using .live() from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/die/
[14:51:46] <gnarf> yedimind: where is this data coming from?
[14:51:49] <dabear> ?die(..,..) @ hdon_
[14:51:50] <bot-t> hdon_, .die(eventType, [handler]): Remove an event handler previously attached using .live() from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/die/#die2
[14:52:07] <yedimind> gnarf, websocket in this case
[14:52:09] <dabear> hdon_: you can remove specific ones :)
[14:52:27] <yedimind> and im buffering a large data set
[14:52:37] <gnarf> yedimind: um - you want to do an array intersection of a million records client side? you're insane
[14:52:59] <hdon_> dabear: :D :D thank you! sorry i did not see that myself
[14:53:20] <gnarf> yedimind: there has to be a better way to handle the processing server side and just send the results to the client
[14:53:40] <razzi> yemind, you can do it by iterating once array1 and once array2..
[14:53:48] <Anime> im trying to load one image and set it to some specific positions in the list. the positions are stored in the placement array. what's happening is that the image is only being set to the last position the placement array has instead of them all. could someone gimme a hand? thanks in advance! function: http://pastebin.com/CPuB5mC6
[14:53:50] <razzi> can't get more efficient than that
[14:53:59] <razzi> yedimind*
[14:54:02] <gnarf> razzi: it can if both arrays are sorted :)
[14:54:08] <razzi> not needed
[14:54:32] <hdon_> fuck i need to get out of my office right now or i'm going to FREEEAAAAAK OOOUUUUT
[14:54:34] <hdon_> thanks for the help guys
[14:54:37] <hdon_> razzi: good luck
[14:54:41] <hdon_> everyone have a happy thanksgiving
[14:54:59] <yedimind> gnarf, thing is, im trying to create an app that is all client side and can be deployed locally
[14:55:02] <Danny_x> he should iterate array1 and if key is not in array 2 insert it else remove it from array2 and insert in array3
[14:55:03] <yedimind> without any back end services
[14:55:06] <yedimind> all done through websockets
[14:55:09] <dabear> hdon_: thanks, but you realize that most people here AREN'T located in the US?
[14:55:25] <dabear> and most don't celebrate thanksgiving as a result...
[14:55:25] <gnarf> yedimind: well you're still insane :)
[14:55:26] <razzi> hdon_, ok didn't think it through, you are right
[14:55:36] <yedimind> gnarf, i dont disagree with that statement :)
[14:55:59] <hdon_> dabear: well it's US Thanksgiving holiday no matter where you are, and i hope you have a good day no matter how you regard its Holiday status
[14:56:12] <yedimind> dabear, does that also imply that the people who don't live in the US are somehow offended ?
[14:56:15] <Danny_x> iterate trough the smallest array, and at the end you have array2 with unique and array 3 with duplicates
[14:56:43] <dabear> yedimind: offended? by what?
[14:56:46] <gnarf> Danny_x: "key is not in" implies its not an array - it implies that its an object
[14:56:58] <razzi> hdon_, actually, no you weren't right .. it's possible with single interation of array1 and single iteration of array2
[14:57:05] <yedimind> yeah right now what im doing is im iterating through array1 and and matching it against array2, then if a match is found removing the value from array1
[14:57:13] <yedimind> and then whats left should be unique
[14:57:31] <razzi> yedimind, that's costly
[14:57:37] <yedimind> but ... yeah
[14:57:47] <gnarf> thats like O(n^2)
[14:57:50] <Danny_x> if you use values as keys should be fast
[14:58:03] <razzi> yedimind, first take array1, make a new array with keys from array1 values, then do what you just described
[14:58:04] <Danny_x> if they are not objects ofc
[14:58:09] <razzi> only 2 iterations
[14:58:12] <gnarf> razzi: arrays don't have keys
[14:58:16] <gnarf> well they do
[14:58:20] <hdon_> razzi: are you talking to the right person? all i did was observe that .indexOf() exists but probably won't help much, and you could use Object properties to get index (usually b-tree iirc) optimization if your values were primitive
[14:58:22] <gnarf> but like you mean object
[14:58:28] <hdon_> said nothing of #iterations of anything
[14:58:49] <razzi> hdon_, i was talking to myself i guess
[14:59:00] <gnarf> yedimind: can you easily cast the data to a string?
[14:59:10] <hdon_> razzi: ok ;) good luck
[14:59:11] <J0rrod> aah good day finally got rmagick working compiled it with some differnet options finally works :P
[14:59:20] <yedimind> parsing the string later to do something with the data seems like it would be just as expensive
[14:59:24] <hdon_> razzi: also check out WebWorkers if you haven't already
[14:59:30] <gnarf> yedimind: you don't need to parse it later
[14:59:31] <yedimind> i do have to actually plot the data at the end of all this
[15:00:06] <yedimind> oh and the kicker is, i cant actually fuck with the index of these values
[15:00:13] <gnarf> yedimind: but if you're talking about two datasets with "millions" in it, its just not realistic amount of processing for a browser event loop
[15:00:16] <yedimind> because there's another array that contains associated data, though i guess i can remedy that with a nested array
[15:00:54] <yedimind> yeah, tbh, i think im just going to throw things into local storage from the websocket
[15:01:03] <yedimind> and then process only a max of say 100 objects at a time
[15:01:13] <gnarf> yedimind: can you worker pool it?
[15:01:14] <yedimind> the only trick is to figure out what the 100 most pretinent objects would be for any given view
[15:01:16] <gnarf> cuz that might work
[15:01:20] <yedimind> yeah
[15:01:21] <razzi> hdon_, oh nice, i used to that with settimeout
[15:01:34] <yedimind> gonna have to think this one out
[15:02:11] <yedimind> ive been so humbled by this whole thing, made me realize just how little i know about data manipulation and processing in js
[15:02:33] <razzi> it's not really js related
[15:02:54] <gnarf> its just raw science for the data processing
[15:02:57] <razzi> we usually avoid searching arrays by created an index from its values
[15:03:13] <razzi> creating*
[15:03:41] <yedimind> yeah for sure, but even the basic diff / intersection logic took me a good half hour of staring at a whiteboard
[15:03:44] <yedimind> before i went OHHH YEAH DUH
[15:04:09] <gnarf> yedimind: is order important?
[15:04:15] <gnarf> post-processing
[15:04:22] <yedimind> yes
[15:04:33] <yedimind> but it doesnt have to be, i can make a change for that by doing a nested array
[15:04:55] <yedimind> though im not sure how much extra cost is associated with doing this in a 2nd tier of an array vs 2st tier
[15:05:00] <yedimind> ... 1st
[15:06:37] <Alex82> guys anyone could give a look to my code?
[15:06:46] <Alex82> i was trying to build an app with HTML 5, JS storing to localStorage. It does save the js object to localStorage but why ListNotes() does print undefined? How can i print the object properties ? http://jsfiddle.net/KgEEK/1/

[15:15:13] <coldhead> you never reply to my PMs!
[15:18:36] <dwarder> has anyone tried http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/ ? there is a way to style this tooltips by using classes: 'ui-tooltip-tipsy ui-tooltip-shadow' , i can't understand where this styles are
[15:18:51] <dwarder> they don't work for some reason
[15:19:01] <dwarder> example http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/demos/#imagemap
[15:27:06] <Columcille> Question. I have a draggable div inside a container div. The droppables are in a separate div. The container div is set overflow: scroll; which means when I drag my dragable out of the container, it won't be visible. Is there a way in jQuery to change the dom so that when the dragable begins to move, it gets assigned a new parent element so it's not in the container div?
[15:29:46] <Columcille> think I found it, did not realize that .append() could basically do this
[15:38:45] <minna> anyone with experience with ajaxpro and jquery?
[15:39:01] <minna> im having problem with the error-message
[15:40:39] <minna> I get: uncaught  exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [false,"ERROR:  The value you entered is wrong."];/*
[15:40:44] <minna> In FF console
[15:41:07] <ohcibi> i'm doing a $('element').load(url, data); but the webserver receives a POST request. why is that?
[15:41:58] <minna> ohcibi: You can use .ajax instead, there you can set the method.
[15:42:15] <minna> ohcibi: it's more powerful
[15:42:18] <k2iguvahetaja> hey
[15:42:55] <ohcibi> minna: of course, but i wanted to use load because its more short 8-))... but it seems that jquery is doing a post when giving a map as data... when using a string, its issueing a get request
[15:42:57] <k2iguvahetaja> does anyone know any plugin to treshold keyup events from input? I would like to make every request for example every 500ms when user is typing
[15:44:02] <minna> ohcibi: please post the call
[15:45:07] <ohcibi> minna: elem.load(link.attr('href') + ' #ID', {token: token});
[15:45:14] <minna> k2iguvahetaja: Then do it between each type, count the amount of keyup's done on an input field, then run the request. Doing it in periods of time is bad
[15:45:40] <ohcibi> minna: with 'token=' + token instaed it works... but i just recall that it worked with {token: token} as well today on my office-pc... strange.. using same browser and OS oO
[15:46:52] <k2iguvahetaja> minna, maybe user types 1 char
[15:46:57] <k2iguvahetaja> and it never executes :D
[15:47:47] <minna> k2iguvahetaja: Run it on each 5, starting on 1.
[15:48:08] <Alex82> i was trying to build an app with HTML 5, JS storing to localStorage. It does save the js object to localStorage but why ListNotes() does print undefined? How can i print the object properties ? http://jsfiddle.net/KgEEK/1/
[15:48:11] <k2iguvahetaja> but 2?
[15:48:24] <k2iguvahetaja> and 3,4?
[15:48:29] <k2iguvahetaja> time is better than this
[15:48:44] <minna> k2iguvahetaja: Then do time.
[15:49:12] <ChrisPartridge> Is there anyway to check how many reflows the DOM is doing?
[15:49:24] <minna> k2iguvahetaja: I'd bet you would have to do a serialize on all fields and post them all in periods of time, rather than doing it per field.
[15:49:56] <k2iguvahetaja> no
[15:50:02] <k2iguvahetaja> it affects only 1 field not a form
[15:51:11] <minna> k2iguvahetaja: Hm, do a post on each keyup, put a delay counter, then reset the counter if the user presses a keyup again before the time run out.
[15:52:14] <minna> k2iguvahetaja: here is a good timer reset, first answer http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3706957/reset-on-hover-jquery

[15:53:34] <mathi> php returns for current date 23/11/2011
[15:53:42] <mathi> but JS still returns 25/11/2011
[15:53:47] <mathi> how is this possible ?
[15:55:10] <coldhead> did you try restarting the browser?
[15:55:58] <mathi> no

[16:15:34] <mgoeppner> Quick question -- is it the indended behavior of $("#element").text() to return the text of that element plus the text of any nested elements?
[16:18:09] <mgoeppner> ex: http://jsfiddle.net/XG7Gg/
[16:20:01] <turboneat> hey can you guys recommend something to use for displaying formatted code in my page?
[16:21:30] <VeXii> <code></code> + css? :>
[16:22:14] <turboneat> yeah but like that dont do syntax highlighting and line #'s and stuff
[16:22:16] <turboneat> right?
[16:22:27] <mgoeppner> <pre></pre>?
[16:25:20] <minna> how do i check if an ajax response contains a specific text?
[16:26:57] <minna> I know how to check if it contains a specific element, but not text.
[16:28:29] <mgoeppner> data.match(<regular expression here>)
[16:28:49] <velts> could anyone recomend any good jquery file uploader?
[16:28:58] <mgoeppner> assuming you are getting text back
[16:29:17] <minna> mgoeppner: Hm, it's that easy?
[16:29:35] <minna> mgoeppner: *testing*
[16:30:55] <quizme> how do you convert the jquery array-like object into a real javascript array?   as in?.. $('.channel_option').map(function(i, elt){return $(elt).attr('channel');})
[16:31:39] <mgoeppner> minna: match will return the matched text so you may want to wrap it in something that spits out a boolean depending on what you are doing
[16:32:56] <mgoeppner> search() will return a numerical position
[16:33:10] <minna> mgoeppner: Yes, i got a match, now im doing an if statement that checks if the text is what i expect it to be.
[16:33:11] <mgoeppner> -1 if it isn't in the string so theres another option
[16:33:27] <minna> mgoeppner: Great
[16:33:33] <mgoeppner> no problem!
[16:33:43] <minna> mgoeppner: Thanks for the help :-)
[16:33:59] <mgoeppner> :D np
[16:36:16] <ChrisPartridge> If I $el.append($collectionOfEl) - does this append each item via a loop behind the scenes?
[16:56:38] <TofuTurkey> folder = $form.find( \'input[name="folder"]\' ).val(), <-- does not capture the <select name=folder> selected field, am I using the wrong capture ? hidden and text fields work ok
[17:01:49] <ChrisPartridge> TofuTurkey: perhaps select[name=folder] ?
[17:02:53] <mgoeppner> ChrisPartridge: took the words out of my head.
[17:02:59] <mgoeppner> or fingers.
[17:05:52] <mgoeppner> $('select[name=folder]').val();

[17:09:35] <minna> Can normal plugins be used with jquery mobile?
[17:10:05] <minna> Uhm.
[17:11:29] <minna> Oh my.
[17:11:50] <minna> I see jquery mobile requires jquery 1.6.4 too, i thought it was a jquery on it's own!
[17:12:38] <minna> Man that's heavy
[17:13:09] * ChrisPartridge nods
[17:13:55] <minna> I mean, that's basically 200kb of only javascript. And that's the minified scripting!
[17:14:00] <minna> Geesh.
[17:14:03] <piklu> anybody looks for stock and equity trades?
[17:14:17] <minna> piklu: Sure.
[17:14:44] <minna> piklu: I'll buy anything, if you just stay on topic.
[17:15:07] <ChrisPartridge> minna: gzip should help a little
[17:15:24] <piklu> No, its like I developed a small program and would want people to use it
[17:15:25] <piklu> lol
[17:16:12] <coldhead> i'm sure twitter would be interested to hear of your new project

[17:16:28] <piklu> i am a normal guy
[17:16:55] <kanzie> Im building a virtual numpad for my site that will be used to fill out a bunch of fields but Im having a problem trying to figure out how to make it generic so that I don't have to have five sets of the same html-elements, one per field, with same amount of event-listeners.
[17:17:35] <ChrisPartridge> kanzie: bubble those clicks
[17:17:36] <kanzie> hmm, I haven't thought it through enough to ask a valid question. Ill be back
[17:17:57] <kanzie> ChrisPartridge: how do you mean?
[17:18:30] <kanzie> I think if I tie a click-event to each field, then in the click-event I clone() and append() the numpad
[17:18:59] <kanzie> only problem is how I can capture the clicks on each key and know where I should enter them
[17:19:40] <kanzie> I guess I could traverse the numpad-element to the nearest of a certain class, and the field that had the click event I can remember the target of...
[17:19:44] <kanzie> hmm, should be possible
[17:19:48] <ChrisPartridge> kanzie: perhaps im not understanding exactly what your trying to do, is it a numpad in the sense that you select a field and it will pop up?
[17:22:33] <kanzie> yeah, but it is custom designed. So it has a input-field at the top that shows what you have pressed and when you press an attached ok-button it populates the field that you clicked. Alertnatively it should be able to call my controller with a save-request. But I need to start making some code and then perhaps I will have a more defined questions
[17:30:34] <Alex82> hi all do u know why my function ListNotes does not print the html in the ul ? http://jsfiddle.net/KgEEK/7/
[17:31:41] <Alex82> it prints out only "undefined" on browser for each task i submit in the input box
[17:32:12] <dwarder> what event should i use for the situation when a certain radio button is selected?
[17:41:07] <dwarder> is it possible to run a certain function when a certain div is updated?
[17:41:54] <dwarder> i don't want to bind to $.ajax's success param
[17:41:55] <krogant> hi, how do i choose the xth row of a table?
[17:44:06] <Doodie> hi, I am just learning jquery. I want to display new text after every 10 seconds. What is the basic code, like array and other?
[17:44:52] <VeXii> setTimeout
[17:45:03] <VeXii> no sorry setInterval
[17:45:36] <Doodie> VeXii, ok, will check that out.
[17:45:50] <coldhead> you can have my knife if you come back!
[17:47:06] <VeXii> setInterval(function(){//do stuff},10000)
[17:48:20] <krogant> var handler = setInterval(function(){//stuff}, 100000000);
[17:48:41] <krogant> at least then you'll be able to window.clearInterval(handler);
[17:49:11] <Doodie> this is helpful in loop also?
[17:49:18] <krogant> no
[17:49:24] <krogant> that will "loop"
[17:49:52] <krogant> it's what setInterval does. it you want it just once, use setTimeout(//stuff,ms)
[17:51:50] <Doodie> setTimeout is from javascript,  not from jquery right (i know jquery is simple form of javascript)????
[17:52:28] <HarryPitfall> setTimeout is preferred
[17:52:47] <HarryPitfall> and you set to call the function
[17:53:11] <coldhead> ?mdc settimeout
[17:53:19] <coldhead> oh god i miss you so much bot-t
[17:53:28] <HarryPitfall> I mean, inside the timeout function, you set again to call at end
[17:54:50] <krogant> why is setTimeout preferred over si?
[17:55:09] <coldhead> krogant: http://zetafleet.com/blog/why-i-consider-setinterval-harmful
[17:55:18] <coldhead> eloquently explained and demonstrated in that post
[17:56:09] <krogant> noted. i've just done a little setup with si, so i think i should change that ;)
[17:59:39] <krogant> have docs gone down? i get server not found
[17:59:48] <krogant> and there we go
[18:04:23] <krogant> is this a valid selector string? http://pastebin.com/BqyzFYV7
[18:08:24] <dwarder> why ajaxComplete takes so long to complete?
[18:08:36] <coldhead> network latency?
[18:08:39] <coldhead> get a faster server?
[18:16:02] <Whirl3d> Happy Thanksgiving all. In order to trigger the "load" event on an image if it's cached in IE, do you have to use the literal $("img").bind("load",somefunc); or can you use the shortcut $("img").load(somefunc)?
[18:20:04] <minna> Why i can't reference an object that has been put into the DOM via ajax?
[18:20:07] <Whirl3d> And furthermore, how does .one fit in to this? If I use $("img").one("load",loadHandler).attr("src",imgURL), when I check if it's cached in IE by: if ($("img")[0].complete) {$("img").trigger("load")}, will it ever get caught in an endless loop?
[18:20:12] <minna> *select and element
[18:21:45] <Thomas`-> minna, are you sure your trying to select it after you dynamically insert it and not before hand?
[18:23:46] <minna> Thomas`-: Pretty shure it's after... In my response, i have this: $('#item').replaceWith($item); reBuildOnchange();
[18:24:14] <minna> The replace, is where the item get's replaced. And the rebuild is where i select the element that got replaced.
[18:24:27] <minna> I even tried selecting it in the console, no luck
[18:27:39] <Thomas`-> minna, that does seem weird. hm..
[18:28:06] <minna> Thomas`-: Can you remove the apostrphe from you'r nick, it's very annoying to write each time.
[18:28:36] <minna> Thomas`-: I tried selecting the element, that works fine, but if i try to select the attribute, it says it does not exist.
[18:28:50] <minna> What the fuck.
[18:31:34] <minna> I guess i'll just have to change the onchange in the response code.
[18:32:07] <Thomas`-> you mean element.attr("id") doesn't exist?
[18:33:11] <bl4ckcomb> hi, I've been seeing $this, self, $$, ... in jQuery plugins as a reference for $(this). which one should actually be used in custom plugins?
[18:33:26] <bl4ckcomb> (conventionally)
[18:33:43] <minna> Thomas`-: The class exists, and can be selected, but not the onchange attribute on the new element.
[18:33:43] <Thomas`-> minna, by the way IRC TIP:  Start typing the nick name then press <Tab> to auto-complete it
[18:34:08] <minna> Thomas`-: Yeah, but there's two thomases.. so i have to type the apostrpohe manually.
[18:36:00] <minna> This is just nuts.
[18:36:21] <minna> If i select it using [onchange] it select's it
[18:37:21] <bl4ckcomb> minna, pressing tab twice will give you the second one in the list, etc.
[18:38:48] <minna> bl4ckcomb: Not on pidgin :-S
[18:38:57] <minna> Argh...
[18:39:05] <minna> I can even remove the attribute!!
[18:39:14] <bl4ckcomb> I assumed you had a real IRC client :p
[18:39:16] <minna> But i cant change it
[18:39:25] <minna> Yeah, sorry about that.
[18:39:35] <minna> I'll just have to  write the apostrophe
[18:41:57] <minna> Oh
[18:42:01] <minna> now i see what's wrong.
[18:47:13] <aFtAb> Hello is there a way to detect using jQuery when a certain javascript function is triggered ?
[18:47:55] <VeXii> can you get the function to trigger a event?
[18:48:55] <aFtAb> actually there is a window.open function triggered from some external javascript on my webpage which I want to detect when it triggers it should just give an alert
[18:50:34] <VeXii> you sure its the script that fires the window.open and not the browser?
[18:50:47] <dwarder> does an event exist that will be executed upon moving to another page, right before that?
[18:51:20] <VeXii> window.close
[18:52:00] <aFtAb> well its written in the script and browse fires it but i just want to show an alert something like a popup is about to display or something whenever there is a window.open function opens
[18:55:16] <VeXii> im miss understanding, sorry its 4am here
[18:59:36] <minna> Hm, how do i convert the response to html?
[19:03:18] <minna> nvm
[19:11:33] <aFtAb> is it possible to block iframe to use window.open function using jquery ?
[19:17:09] <zulax> in my drop function for droppable, i have a funciton myfun()
[19:17:31] <zulax> if i put the line ui.draggable().remove() before the fxn call, then the fxn call doesnt work
[19:17:35] <zulax> why?
[19:43:32] <minna> I'm getting some wierd response using an ajax request. I get this: [0,"<!-- Part of header -->\r\n\r\n<section id=...etc html... ]"];/* What does it mean? And how do i get a proper html response?
[19:50:55] <bl4ckcomb> when navigating through sources in github the url in the address bar changes (it's not a hash update), but while navigating it somehow doesn't refresh everything (even the scroll position is kept unchanged). does anyone know how they did this?
[19:51:31] <bl4ckcomb> or is everything just loaded really fast?
[20:01:35] <guest28371293712> jquery.proxy can take effect for only one level?
[20:06:20] <Whirl3d> Could someone help me with extending jQuery? I am trying to create a bounds() function and it's not working: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/YkWVV/5/
[20:09:12] <Whirl3d> anybody out there?
[20:09:42] <ChrisPartridge> Whirl3d: What exactly are you trying to do there?
[20:10:56] <Whirl3d> ChrisPartridge, thanks for the reply. I simply want to use the statement: $("something").bounds() to return an object that has more than just the top and left properties of Position()
[20:12:21] <Whirl3d> Often when I am aligning objects, I need to align them by their center, bottom, or right edge relative to the object. I just want to be able to get quick access to all those "boundary" points in one function.

[20:16:46] <VeXii_> one level?

[20:20:51] <richardr> I want to create a jQuery plugin. It will render widgets, the only difference between them all is how they're rendered (the html, parsing of the returned data). What sort of design pattern should I build the jQuery library around?
[20:21:17] <richardr> So perhaps something like $('#ele').widget({type: 'first'}); would use the render method of 'first'
[20:21:40] <richardr> An example would be awesome ;-) Thanks
[20:23:45] <sorrymyeng> hi everybody, im getting html data using .load(), and i have a trouble with encoding of received html-code, im added a meta-tag in its code, but it is not working, can you help me?
[20:25:22] <Whirl3d> sorrymyeng, if you are loading an entire html document and want to have access to it's <head> element, you can't append the loaded result to the dom or it will strip it off.
[20:27:19] <sorrymyeng> Whirl3d: i do not need to access <head>, content in received code fully wrapped with <div>, there is no <body> even
[20:28:11] <Whirl3d> That's because there can only be one <body> element in the dom and you already have one. So you can manipulate the text returned from the load handler to get your information before appending it to the dom.
[20:29:49] <Whirl3d> $.load(url, {datatype:"html", success:function (data) { //data is raw text including header, body, etc.});
[20:30:30] <sorrymyeng> Whirl3d: i have solved that problem right now added php: header("Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8"); into received page
[20:30:43] <sorrymyeng> Whirl3d: thank you:)
[20:31:09] <Whirl3d> 8)
[20:32:37] <guest28371293712> VeXii_: yeah
[20:32:54] <guest28371293712> if i restrict this to be an object to a function A
[20:33:01] <guest28371293712> and A calls B
[20:33:11] <guest28371293712> in B the "this" can be other thing
[20:38:00] <richardr> Anyone? Just pointing me in the right direction would be a great help thanks
[20:38:39] <Whirl3d> google karl swedburg jquery plugin
[20:40:24] <Whirl3d> richardr, try this: http://www.learningjquery.com./2009/03/making-a-jquery-plugin-truly-customizable
[20:42:00] <richardr> Whirl3d: that's helpful but not quite what I'm looking for... let me do some psudo code for an example
[20:42:22] <Whirl3d> have you checked the jquery UI widget factory?
[20:46:48] <richardr> Whirl3d: I can't use jquery UI as a dependency
[20:47:51] <richardr> Whirl3d: this is really rough, but demonstrates what I would like to do, with a jquery plugin http://pastie.org/private/hs4sa47vxoaii3uuwgtm1w
[20:48:32] <richardr> Whirl3d: each 'type' i pass to it will use a different render function, without using if then else statements, switch, etc.... not sure how to implement this with jquery plugin
[20:50:09] <Whirl3d> I guess you need to setup a closure, pass the jquery object to it and then iterate through the collection, returning your new widgets based on your passed parameters.
[20:51:03] <Whirl3d> http://www.learningjquery.com/2007/10/a-plugin-development-pattern
[20:52:59] <richardr> Hmm, Whirl3d: I sort of understand what's happening there... so I would iterate through the objects, and match it with the type passed in ?
[20:54:34] <richardr> Whirl3d: Do you have any more examples closer to what I'm trying to achieve by any chance?
[20:54:37] <Whirl3d> so you are wanting to be able to apply the $.widget() function to any object and without checking the source object's type, somehow magically setup formatting methods specific to the source object's type?
[20:56:21] <richardr> Whirl3d: or suggestions on how I should do this? Each widget has the same data source, same format response, all the differs is the way they're rendered (the HTML)
[20:56:41] <richardr> Whirl3d: pretty open to ideas, just want to learn new techniques
[20:57:27] <richardr> Whirl3d: and the only other thing was , each uses a different target element. So different target element + different rendering/presentation logic
[20:58:22] <Whirl3d> If I were you, I would write the plugin with default settings that establish the data source and format response
[20:59:21] <Whirl3d> Then use a selector to select your elements that render in a certain manner, and pass your render function to your instantiation of the widget. So all selected elements behave one way. Then another set of selected elements behave a different way
[21:00:14] <richardr> :o That makes a lot more sense
[21:01:59] <Whirl3d> so you would write your rendering functions for each "class" of element (using $(this) to represent the element with the function), then you would store those functions in local variables inside of your init function
[21:03:25] <Whirl3d> then you would call initRenderers() { var renderstyleA=function (targ) {do something}; var renderstyleB=function (targ) {something else}, $("aclass").widget(renderstyleA); $("bClass").widget(renderstyleB); }
[21:04:25] <Whirl3d> or actually, better yet would be to pass the function as a property of the settings object like $("aclass").width({renderfunc:renderStyleA});
[21:04:34] <Whirl3d> *widget, not width
[21:04:48] <richardr> Ah, smart
[21:05:48] <Whirl3d> That also lets you setup your default render function by: $.fn.widget.renderfunc=defaultRenderfunc;
[21:08:36] <Whirl3d> I have been playing with binding custom functions to objects to see if it is a good idea to do during instantiation. So inside my widget plugin, I have the line $(this).bind("render",customrender);  and later I can then use $("item").trigger("render");
[21:13:38] <amirite> how do i remove an element from a jquery set
[21:13:56] <amirite> i.e. i have a set of elements not appended to the dom in a jquery object and i want to remove the second item, for example
[21:14:03] <amirite> i.e. the opposite of .add();
[21:14:46] <Whirl3d> ?.not@amirite
[21:14:47] <bot-t> amirite, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[21:14:55] <richardr> Whirl3d: thanks for your help
[21:15:01] <Whirl3d> np
[21:15:32] <amirite> thanks whirl
[21:15:37] <Whirl3d> np
[21:15:53] <richardr> Whirl3d: this is really helpful to me
[21:16:27] <Whirl3d> Just remember me when you get rich off it. LOL
[21:16:55] <richardr> Whirl3d: haha, this isn't for money. i'm just learning :)
[21:17:22] <Whirl3d> drats. 8)
[21:18:29] <richardr> Whirl3d: what if, I wanted to bind events to this particular widget . say it had a 'more' button, and i click this and it renders more data
[21:18:50] <richardr> Whirl3d: and each widget had *slightly* different events, but basic stuff
[21:20:07] <Whirl3d> You could pass the event functions in the options object when you instantiate. Then, you just iterate through the options object (extending the default object, of course) and bind the custom events along with the standard events.
[21:20:17] <Whirl3d> EIther that or make extensive use of the DATA object
[21:20:37] <Whirl3d> Where you can store object-specific functions for easy access and manipulation.
[21:21:08] <Whirl3d> Using the MetaData plugin, then you could add the configuration information to your objects using markup.
[21:21:20] <richardr> didn't quite understand the first one, how would i pass around events like that?
[21:21:38] <Whirl3d> <div class={background-color:#fff}>white background</div>
[21:23:12] <Whirl3d> In other words (option1) you would have your basic "start" "complete" "render" functions in your plugin definition. Then you when you were making your objects, you would check the parameters passed to it for other functions that you could then bind (without question) to the object.
[21:23:33] <Whirl3d> It's probably not the best way to do it, but it would most likely work.
[21:25:01] <richardr> Whirl3d: what about, something along the lines of: http://pastie.org/private/tbqmgcnv0ozidxu0hpbz0a
[21:25:25] <richardr> Whirl3d: 1) is that appropriate for my case 2) is that a decent approach (better than your suggestion?)
[21:25:45] <richardr> Whirl3d: and then I do some logic in the render function to see which one to pick
[21:26:16] <richardr> Whirl3d: or is it the same thing as your suggestion, except I'm hard-coding stuff in my jquery plugin
[21:30:36] <Whirl3d> gimme a couple of minutes. I'll be right back.
[21:31:42] <richardr> Whirl3d: alright, had another thought too. jQuery templates.
[21:40:39] <mgeary> hi folks
[21:41:42] <mgeary> hey, if i have a table instance as a jquery object, how can i get a tbody inside that instance? i know how to do it with a css selector, but not how to do it from an instance var
[21:43:52] <Whirl3d> richardr, this is a ROUGH example of how I **think** it is supposed to be done. I'm not the best person to advise you on this, but I think it's close: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/pQX5a/2/
[21:44:47] <Whirl3d> mgeary, if you have a table element as a jquery object, use $(tableObject).find("tbody")
[21:45:01] <mgeary> Whirl3d: awesome. thanks
[21:45:08] <Whirl3d> ?.find @mgeary
[21:45:08] <bot-t> mgeary, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[21:45:42] <mgeary> works great
[21:45:44] <mgeary> thanks again

[21:48:07] <Whirl3d> richardr, the big guns on this channel are often around: ajpiano, coldhead, ryanneufield, blackspotwiggins, gnarf (to name a few). These guys have really been a godsend for me and if they were here right now, you would learn a lot more from them.
[22:30:03] <larsemil> i dont get it, running jQuery('li.class').index() in firebug renders correct index of item. When i do it in code i get -1, how can this be?
[22:30:18] <larsemil> nevermind
[22:30:28] <Eviltwin> Glad we could help
[22:35:29] <guest82324723847> how do you do jsonp ?
[22:35:38] <Eviltwin> ?g JSONP
[22:35:39] <bot-t> Eviltwin, JSONP - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP
[22:35:50] <Eviltwin> Take a look at that
[22:35:54] <coldhead> SURELY IT CAN'T BE THAT SIMPLE
[22:35:57] <guest82324723847> manual said if the url contains callback=, it would be jsonp altomatically
[22:36:08] <Eviltwin> guest82324723847: Server needs to be JSONP too
[22:36:20] <dogarrhea2> found another bug
[22:36:21] <guest82324723847> but Chrome blocked my cross-domain request Eviltwin

[22:37:02] <dogarrhea2> http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/constrain-movement.html    if you attempt to drag the "I am contained within my parent" down to the bottom of the screen where the screen can scroll, it goes outside of the parent
[22:37:36] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Manual says you can
[22:37:53] <dogarrhea2> can do what? drag outside the parent?
[22:38:02] <Eviltwin> Not for me
[22:38:10] <dogarrhea2> perhaps a screenshot
[22:38:14] <Eviltwin> guest82324723847: Manual says you can
[22:38:17] <Eviltwin> Wrong target
[22:38:27] <larsemil> Eviltwin: well its best not to remove class before .active
[22:38:55] <larsemil> before trying to get it
[22:39:43] <dogarrhea2> http://www.pasteall.org/pic/21414
[22:40:14] <dogarrhea2> i know what you're gonna say: "Developer tools is causing it."
[22:40:26] <dogarrhea2> but if i resize the window for the same "smaller screen" effect, it'll do the same thing
[22:40:27] <guest82324723847> Eviltwin: thanks....!!!!
[22:40:34] <guest82324723847> so the success paramter is ignored?
[22:41:18] <dogarrhea2> anyone else agree this is a bug or am i insane?
[22:44:03] <dogarrhea2> jquery draggable's various options just seem .... broken
[22:45:00] <dogarrhea2> well, moving on. implementing my on draggable
[22:45:32] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Bugs in IE don't really count as bugs
[22:46:22] <dogarrhea2> i thought jquery was supposed to not care about these things.
[22:46:26] <dogarrhea2> and be "crossbrowser"
[22:46:48] <dogarrhea2> what is the point in using it then
[22:47:20] <dogarrhea2> anyways testing on chrome
[22:48:05] <new2net> I'm looking to sort a table (html) much like one would sort a result set in mysql (using ORDER BY `field` [ASC|DESC]). Is there a widget in jquery UI or possibly something in jquery that will do this for me? Seems like something jquery would jump on in a heartbeat.
[22:48:26] <dogarrhea2> Eviltwin:  same thing on Chrome. So much for the "Bugs in IE don't really count as bugs"
[22:48:49] <coldhead> new2net: http://tablesorter.com/docs/
[22:48:55] <dogarrhea2> chrome 15.blahblahblahblah
[22:48:57] <coldhead> fine little plugin
[22:49:08] <coldhead> caveat: you NEED a <th>
[22:49:34] <dogarrhea2> ok this little test confirms that i have to rewrite jquery draggable. anyways back to work. maybe someone will file a bug but i have no time.
[22:49:44] <new2net> coldhead, way ahead of you :) I always use <th> for headings. You just hit that one out of the park :) perfect
[22:49:58] <luite> is it possible to add jquery objects (a button) to a cell in jquery-ui grid?
[22:50:37] <new2net> coldhead, not only do I use <th>, I also use <thead> and <tbody> looks like it'll just pop right in ^_^
[22:50:45] <coldhead> oh good
[22:50:52] <coldhead> its like it was made for you
[22:51:04] <Eviltwin> jQuery is cross-browser
[22:51:14] <Eviltwin> jQuery UI ideally is but don't necessarily always succeed
[22:51:54] <dogarrhea2> so it's a bug
[22:52:07] <dogarrhea2> it is cross-browser behavior. but it's broken across all browsers lol
[22:52:42] <Eviltwin> I am not having the same problem
[22:52:51] <Eviltwin> Do you have like plugins or something on your browsers?
[22:53:04] <dogarrhea2> are you having trouble replicating the steps?
[22:53:09] <Eviltwin> 'Cause I'm not seeing it in Safari, Firefox, or Chrome here
[22:53:11] <dogarrhea2> i just installed chrome 5 minutes ago
[22:53:33] <dogarrhea2> change your browser size to something where a scrollbar on the right shows up.
[22:53:52] <dogarrhea2> drag the element that is "contained in parent etc." towards the part of the screen which will cause a scroll.
[22:55:11] <dogarrhea2> for those of you trying to follow along, it's at http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/constrain-movement.html for the "contained in parent" draggable
[22:55:18] <dogarrhea2> you can actually drag it outside if your window is resized.
[22:55:25] <Eviltwin> Not sure anyone is trying to follow along :P
[22:55:40] <dogarrhea2> were you able to replicate Eviltwin?
[22:55:52] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I didn't realize you needed to make the window scroll
[22:55:54] <Eviltwin> Missed that part
[22:57:15] <Eviltwin> I'm guessing this is to account for a scrolling parent element
[22:58:25] <Eviltwin> Well report it to jQuery UI devs
[23:06:32] <dogarrhea2> hrm. meanwhile what to do about this draggable..
[23:06:35] <dogarrhea2> i need it to work.
[23:09:04] <Eviltwin> What's your goal?
[23:09:18] <Eviltwin> I might be able to help you write something
[23:09:28] <luite> hmm looks like a rowTemplate can only return text
[23:09:50] <Eviltwin> luite: What is this regarding?
[23:09:50] <dogarrhea2> to keep the dragging inside the specified box
[23:10:15] <dogarrhea2> i may be satisfied if the screen doesn't scroll when i drag.
[23:10:24] <luite> Eviltwin: oh sorry wrong window. related to my earlier question though, how to get a button in a jquery-ui grid cell
[23:13:04] <coldhead> Committed revision 146100.
[23:13:31] <dogarrhea2> gotta go to sleep now
[23:14:46] <coldhead> goodnight dogarrhea2
[23:14:52] <dogarrhea2> night
[23:15:33] <luite> Eviltwin: I can get it now, with a refresh hook on the grid and a custom row template, but it's a bit ugly that way
[23:16:00] <luite> I think there should be a better way, dunno if there is one, it's pre-alpha stuff after all :)
[23:23:54] <marlun> I'm using jQuery UI sortable on a table and would like to detect when a user drags one of the rows outside of the table so I can remove it. Whats the easiest way? :)
[23:28:11] <Eviltwin> marlun: Drop targets?
[23:31:49] <marlun> Eviltwin: I found an easy way with the events out, over, beforeStop and a flag :)

[23:46:36] <new2net> Is #jquery-ui an official channel? Should I be asking my jquery-ui questions in there instead of here?
[23:46:58] <Eviltwin> Apparently they should be asked here
[23:47:04] <Eviltwin> This was news to me
[23:47:53] <new2net> I see. I am having issues with the tabs widget completely thrashing my CSS- its not even recognized even if I make it super super specific.
[23:48:10] <Eviltwin> Can you make a jsFiddle example of your problem?
[23:48:49] <new2net> I'm not sure what jsFiddle is. But if it will help you assist me I can try.
[23:48:55] <Eviltwin> ?jsfiddle
[23:48:56] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker).

These tools allow you to replicate your issue and pres
[23:57:48] <new2net> Eviltwin, sorry. It's absolutely disorienting how ugly my markup is. Everything is written as a jquery-ui wrapper on the backend and I pay no attention to indentation or anything (firebug helps me see that).  This may take a while.  Maybe there's a way to put a panel into a safe-place? Like an iframe, except not so wasteful (will need to reload every library).
