[00:32:45] <molavy> hi
[00:33:46] <molavy> i want every time a ajax complete if response data have key alarmerr alert it
[00:34:13] <molavy> but i don' know how to set .ajaxSuccess for this porpose
[00:34:18] <madprops> how can i trigger a function if the html of a div changes?
[00:34:35] <molavy> i used this code:
[00:34:37] <molavy> $( document ).ajaxStart( function() {
[00:35:04] <molavy> }).ajaxSuccess( function(e, xhr, settings) {
[00:35:05] <molavy> 		alert(xhr.responseXML);
[00:35:22] <molavy> any idea?
[00:35:51] <fraserkillip> Why not use the $.ajax() function?
[00:37:37] <fraserkillip> madprops: what would be changing the HTML in the div?
[00:37:58] <molavy> because it is global .for every request it must check if has key alarmerr then alert it
[00:38:08] <madprops> fraserkillip, ajax call, im going to try this http://www.codingforums.com/showpost.php?s=079313e61c884381df937231f6160ce6&p=1109115&postcount=4
[00:38:19] <berserkr> hello all
[00:39:33] <molavy> any idea?
[00:39:53] <fraserkillip> molavy: i don't sorry
[00:40:20] <fraserkillip> madprops: If you are changing it with an ajax call then you know when it has been changed?
[00:41:41] <madprops> fraserkillip, yeah but i want a listener to handle the job for me
[00:41:55] <fraserkillip> why is that?
[00:42:53] <berserkr> i have a problem with de slider widget of jquery ui.. The problem is that the draggable part exceeds the limit of the slider container, also in the example of the official webpage (http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/). Anyone knows how can I limit that??
[00:43:53] <madprops> fraserkillip, im trying to do this http://jsfiddle.net/BNETB/
[00:43:53] <fraserkillip> beserkr: how much have you googled for that because i have seen the same Q posted here a few times in the last week
[00:44:14] <madprops> fraserkillip, but im getting Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'addEventListener'
[00:44:53] <fraserkillip> this is taking a while to load, my connection is terrible
[00:45:11] <berserkr> fraserkillip: i suppose that is a bug.. i've not found any post about it
[00:45:40] <Paganini> berserkr the slider is fine ony my machine, must be an OS/browser issue I'd presume?
[00:45:58] <fraserkillip> ah, i believe its because you are putting a DOM event on a jQuery object. use the getElementByID() like in the example you showed me
[00:46:05] <fraserkillip> madprops: ^
[00:46:51] <berserkr> Paganini: the official example looks right on yor browser? I use google chrome
[00:48:30] <fraserkillip> berserkr: It looks fine on mine too FF5 Mac 10.7
[00:48:39] <Paganini> berserkr yeah the official website looks fine on mine, windows 7 chrome
[00:49:08] <Paganini> berserkr: in both the link and 'new window' link on the page...
[00:49:08] <fraserkillip> beserkr: how much further does it extend for you?
[00:52:11] <berserkr> I see that the draggable block exceeds the limit of the container because the last left parameter is "left: 100%" and it make that the block stops at left of the container
[00:54:27] <berserkr> well, i think I need a negative margin left
[00:54:38] <fraserkillip> Exceed by how much though? Half the length of the handle?
[00:56:37] <berserkr> no. wait i'm making and example
[00:56:49] <fraserkillip> okay
[00:57:08] <fraserkillip> you could show us a screen shot?
[01:01:15] <dannN> Hi. Is it possible to check with $.ajaxSetup on sending an ajax request, if currently an other request is in queue and so the request will send, if the  other request is complete?
[01:08:50] <Paganini> dannN can't you use .ajaxStart / .ajaxError / .ajaxSuccess() to set a variable and then send your next ajax request depending?
[01:09:21] <dannN> hmm, this could work, thanks for the hint Paganini
[01:09:38] <Paganini> dannN so you could create your own little queue so to speak, no worries
[01:10:34] <fraserkillip> i reckon jQuery needs some sort of wait function. like pause execution of this script until the specific param is true
[01:10:47] <quicksilver> fraserkillip: setTimeout / setInterval.
[01:10:51] <irPhunky> If you want that use sexy.js
[01:11:00] <irPhunky> http://www.sexyjs.com/
[01:11:16] <fraserkillip> quicksilver: that doesn't stop execution though
[01:11:37] <quicksilver> fraserkillip: you have to handle it yourself. Javascript is singlethreaded.
[01:11:48] <quicksilver> fraserkillip: if you 'wait' you'll block the whole browser window.
[01:11:55] <fraserkillip> i know
[01:12:02] <fraserkillip> grrrrr
[01:12:04] <fraserkillip> lol
[01:12:04] <quicksilver> well that's a hard thing for a library to solve
[01:12:11] <quicksilver> you have to turn everything into callbacks.
[01:13:03] <irPhunky> Sexyjs gives you sequential ajax/js
[01:13:26] <fraserkillip> Sexyjs has a nice site :)
[01:13:33] <quicksilver> it still forces you to put everythiung inside callbacks / chained function calls
[01:13:45] <quicksilver> not much you can do about that without a complete javascript rewriting frontend
[01:13:46] <dannN> fraserkillip: Nice site or nice legs?
[01:14:09] <quicksilver> e.g. http://chumsley.org/jwacs/
[01:14:16] <fraserkillip> dannN: sorry what site? i only saw legs.... LOL JK both
[01:14:32] <quicksilver> but I'm not aware of a commonly used JS continuations / rewriting framework.
[01:15:07] <dannN> fraserkillip: hrhr. you're right
[01:18:51] <Paganini> can .load() only load 1 DOM at a time?
[01:20:12] <Paganini> I guess I'm asking what the best way to load multiple DOMs from an ajax request would be please?
[01:22:34] <Lee_msi> Hello, i am using a plugin that uses different namespaces to modify the default plugin (i.e. the plugin has a base script, then uses an optional script which has a different namespace to give it jquery UI styling). Is there a way in which to call the plugin via a namespace so i can use the plugin twice but have one use the enhanced version, and one use the base version
[01:22:38] <Lee_msi> if that makes any sense ?
[01:28:02] <berserkr> well, the example JQuery UI Slider is: http://s362377597.mialojamiento.es/
[01:28:46] <berserkr> as you can see, the block exceeds the limit of the bar
[01:29:08] <Paganini> berserkr odd it runs off the right hand side there, but not on the jquery ui official site
[01:30:18] <berserkr> because official site has a negative margin-left for the draggable element
[01:31:29] <berserkr> but I need to fit the block with the bar
[01:32:18] <berserkr> to make a draggable button like iphone
[01:35:12] <fraserkillip> berserkr: are you making a toggle switch exactly like iphone?
[01:36:04] <burg> how can i detect a change on a text input while focus is still on that input?
[01:36:19] <fraserkillip> keyup?
[01:36:37] <berserkr> yes fraserkillip
[01:37:25] <Paganini> berserkr I think you should be toggling the value as $( ".selector" ).slider({ value: 100 }); or value 0
[01:37:36] <Paganini> rather than left: 100% as you're adjusting the actual element.. I think?
[01:38:50] <fraserkillip> I would suggest then. Make a fixed size div. inside that have a div same height twice the width, and make the parent have overflow hidden and apply draggable to the child
[01:39:11] <fraserkillip> may be easier/ more customisable
[01:39:17] <fraserkillip> http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#snap-to
[01:41:44] <fraserkillip> burg: http://api.jquery.com/keyup/
[01:42:26] <burg> tnx
[01:45:09] <fraserkillip> beserkr: maybe this will help: http://labs.engageinteractive.co.uk/itoggle/
[01:45:44] <berserkr> fraserkillip: is not posible, because if I do that, the last element of is not clickable
[01:45:59] <fraserkillip> ?
[01:46:37] <berserkr> fraserkillip: omg, is great
[01:47:39] <fraserkillip> berserkr: there is a plugin for almost anything in jQuery. just do some googling first, spesh if its something popular like iOS, every1 replicates iOS
[01:48:24] <madprops> how can I get the container of an image?
[01:48:34] <madprops> by id
[01:49:12] <madprops> i tried closest('#id')
[01:51:50] <Aamir> madprops:  this should work
[01:53:04] <madprops> yeah my bad
[01:53:43] <NielsMob> is there a validation expert in the house, i need some help, I want the error message be only an image and when people hover over that image the message is shown.
[01:53:45] <NielsMob> Is that possible and how can i do that? I have already searched but not found a solution.
[01:54:30] <fraserkillip> NielsMob: error from what?
[01:55:16] <fraserkillip> also you could use the 'title' attribute or look up jquery qTips
[01:57:32] <muzone> Good morning!
[01:57:35] <muzone> *AIRHOOOOORN*
[01:57:37] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/v5MLg/ - why is the Color selection all messed up when you click it?
[02:00:05] <Trisox> !down www.jsfiddle.net
[02:00:14] <Trisox> ?down www.jsfiddle.net
[02:00:21] <bot-t> Trisox, It's not just you! - http://www.jsfiddle.net looks down from here.
[02:00:29] <Trisox> argh
[02:00:38] <NielsMob> fraserkillip: sorry a mend a validation error of a input field.
[02:00:59] <NielsMob> using jquery.validation.js
[02:01:06] <lexMao> Hi there, I'm trying to do a 3d viewer using sequential images. Actually it does not work on IE because dragging the div the mouse selects the image. I've also tried with CSS or by blocking the onselectstart but nothing... Here u can try it http://jquering.altervista.org/
[02:01:18] <lexMao> Can you help me please?
[02:01:24] <fraserkillip> NielsMob: sorry, i don't use that i cant help :)
[02:02:11] <fraserkillip> muzone: you have a </div> closing your <form>, just btw
[02:03:37] <solars> hey, is it possible to somehow tie 2 datepickers together so I have a to-from picker automatically? with restrictions like from has to be < to etc?
[02:03:57] <steveccc> I have a div on which I am using the hoverIntent function and on hover I want to select a div with a class of .icon which is within the hovered div - how can i do this without using id's - can you to something like this.child('classname') ?
[02:04:09] <muzone> i do??
[02:04:33] <muzone> fraserkillip: no i dont
[02:05:07] <fraserkillip> http://jsfiddle.net/v5MLg/ the latest one you posted
[02:05:13] <muzone> wait yes i do
[02:05:24] <muzone> thanks for noticing
[02:06:31] <fraserkillip> the syntax highlighter makes it red, and the page didn't display anything so it wasn't hard to spot
[02:06:58] <peol> solars: You could just do that by listening to the select events and filtering the date pickers on-the-fly. E.g. Select 2011-01 on first one, limit it to 2011-01 to 2011-12 in the second one
[02:07:13] <muzone> allow me to rephrase
[02:07:15] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/UYC5Y/ - why do Color's border extend out of proportion when clicked? Compared to Size under, Color's label has been indented -9999px, maybe that has something to do with it?
[02:07:24] <androoid> hey guys
[02:07:29] <solars> peol, hm yeah I think I will give that a try
[02:07:33] <solars> thank you
[02:09:26] <rethus> can i change the animation of toggle();?
[02:11:40] <lexMao> Hi there, can you help me to fix an issue I'm having with IE? The animation gets stopped because the image is being selected with the mouse, I've tried to stop user selection with css but nothing, a live view here: http://jquering.altervista.org/ (click inside the div with the border and move the mouse left or right). Thank you
[02:13:01] <rethus> LexMao: maybe have a look on css3 "unselectable on"
[02:13:07] <fraserkillip> muzome
[02:13:14] <fraserkillip> muzone *
[02:13:24] <muzone> yes fraserkillip?
[02:13:26] <fraserkillip> you have a text-indent of -9999px
[02:13:35] <fraserkillip> thats your problem
[02:13:47] <muzone> I know, I needed its label to go away
[02:13:52] <muzone> Any other way of doing that?
[02:14:33] <fraserkillip> set text color to bg color maybe?
[02:14:51] <Trisox> lexMao: cool script ;)
[02:14:58] <muzone> fraserkillip: dunno
[02:15:04] <muzone> fraserkillip: maybe i can set display: none?
[02:15:14] <fraserkillip> wait, why do you need the label text?
[02:15:16] <muzone> or no that wont work
[02:15:22] <muzone> i dont need it
[02:15:27] <muzone> but it should be there for accessibility
[02:15:51] <lexMao> rethus: do you mean "user-select: none;"'s family?
[02:16:31] <fraserkillip> okay, just trying something. one sec
[02:16:40] <lexMao> Trisox: thank you :) btw it's not perfect, a lot of missing features and that's not what I need :(
[02:16:46] <fraserkillip> my connexion is currently terrible
[02:17:00] <Trisox> how did you made the images
[02:17:08] <Trisox> thats the hardest part i think..
[02:17:37] <fraserkillip> muzone: fixed it. add overflow:hidden; to #color label
[02:17:41] <Trisox> lol it loads all images pre 4.2 mb
[02:17:42] <Trisox> lol
[02:18:55] <lexMao> Trisox: The images will be provided by a graphic, 3d views of the object
[02:19:17] <Trisox> i get that but making the images is hardest part
[02:19:19] <Trisox> ;)
[02:20:14] <lexMao> Trisox: Luckily I don't have to do them :P
[02:20:22] <Trisox> indeed
[02:20:22] <Trisox> :P
[02:21:01] <lexMao> It was really better by changing the bg image... on firefox it was better the final rendering
[02:21:02] <Trisox> its like 4.2mb in total 180 images
[02:21:09] <muzone> fraserkillip: bless you son
[02:21:20] <cook1es> Hello, how can I see the contents of an [Object object]?
[02:21:29] <Trisox> ....
[02:21:34] <lexMao> Trisox: but on IE it's a hell to develop this 3d viewer -.-
[02:21:35] <Trisox> ?[Object object]
[02:21:37] <bot-t> Trisox, jQuery.extend() - Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[02:21:42] <Trisox> mm
[02:21:44] <Trisox> not that
[02:21:57] <Trisox> i can see that lexMao ie is a hell it self
[02:22:03] <fraserkillip> muzone: no prob, glad to help
[02:22:05] <Trisox> i prob do it in flash.. ughhh
[02:23:12] <lexMao> Trisox, yeah it would be nice but.... it must also work on iPhone and iPad
[02:23:25] <Trisox> ah how does apple do it?
[02:23:50] <fraserkillip> Trisox: I would avoid flash unless it is absolutly nescessary
[02:23:54] <Trisox> true
[02:23:59] <Trisox> always
[02:24:06] <Trisox> but for something like that
[02:24:39] <lexMao> Trisox, I'm giving a read to the js source of the apple website, but it's a complex thing... all integrated with their library extensions
[02:24:52] <fraserkillip> These days, if i'm correct, unless its IE, you are more likely to find a jquery fine browser than one with flash installed
[02:25:16] <fraserkillip> lexMao: is it miified?
[02:25:21] <fraserkillip> minified*
[02:25:28] <Trisox> other browsers is never the problem IE is...
[02:26:15] <fraserkillip> IE is an abomination...... the 5 year old netscape browsers have better support for everything than IE
[02:26:16] <lexMao> fraserkillip, yeah it's minified, but the hardest part is when they call externals objects and you have to read the whole "vr.js" library
[02:26:24] <lexMao> that extends proptotype
[02:26:32] <lexMao> on their website
[02:26:35] <fraserkillip> :O ouch
[02:26:52] <lexMao> yeah :(
[02:27:02] <fraserkillip> copy and paste it to textmate or other text editor and get it to structure it :)
[02:27:45] <lexMao> yeah, I think the best think I can do right now is read their sources
[02:28:38] <fraserkillip> yes, borrow their concepts
[02:29:59] <lexMao> yeah, I'm going to investigate... I'll be back when I'll be a 3d viewer expert (h)
[02:30:08] <Kambfhase> sadmicrowave: 1+2+3=6 :P
[02:30:28] <fraserkillip> ^??
[02:32:13] <rethus> how can i past more than one id, or an id and a class to this: $('#addNewUser')
[02:32:28] <rethus> such way?  $('#addNewUser', '.classname')
[02:32:36] <Kambfhase> $('#id, .class, name') << note the comma
[02:34:13] <Cork> rethus: the selectors work the same as selectors in css
[02:34:27] <rethus> k, thanks
[02:34:44] <Cork> including all the relations
[02:39:32] <muzone> Does anybody know why http://jsfiddle.net/4Q88v/ works and http://home.no/mritz/test doesn't? The code is exactly the same! Man I'm confused!
[02:40:03] <muzone> Works in terms of clicking those buttons
[02:41:35] <rookmoot> hi !
[02:41:51] <Kambfhase> did you know that jQUI comes with a selectable helper?
[02:42:39] <rookmoot> http://pastebin.com/H86h1U8d
[02:42:44] <rookmoot> i'm doing this, and hm
[02:42:56] <rookmoot> i don't really anderstand why that's not working..
[02:43:08] <rookmoot> my tabs is ajaxed
[02:43:22] <medvind> hello! I update a div's contents with jquery, using a button inside the same div. it only works once - when the div is refreshed, the jquery function is no longer triggered. what am I doing wrong?
[02:43:34] <medvind> (I'm doing a shopping cart, and for each item in the cart, there are increase/decrease buttons. when clicked, they trigger a $('.cart_change_product_quantity').click() function. the return msg from the ajax call is the whole, updated shopping cart, which is then loaded into the cart container div)
[02:43:42] <Kambfhase> medvind: http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[02:43:43] <rookmoot> and and each tab have a form, then when the form is submit, my form complete callback is sent then i "reload" the current tab
[02:43:51] <rookmoot> but nothing append
[02:44:14] <medvind> Kambfhase, thanks a lot
[02:44:22] <uptownben> Anyone have a good example of recursive xml traversal using JQ?
[02:46:39] <fraserkillip> muzone: i belive you are calling .change() before the DOM is ready, look at http://jsfiddle.net/6jK9J/ and try that
[02:47:38] <androoid> does anyone know a good animation/transitions framework for jquery
[02:47:47] <androoid> i mean plugin, not framework
[02:48:04] <Cork> androoid: there is some built into jquery
[02:48:08] <Cork> ?.effect
[02:48:11] <bot-t> Cork, UI/Effects/effect - Uses a specific effect on an element (without the show/hide logic). http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/effect
[02:48:17] <Cork> uh... noo
[02:48:46] <androoid> yeah but those effects are really basic
[02:48:56] <Cork> androoid
[02:49:00] <Cork> : what is it your want?
[02:49:14] <Cork> that is, what type of effects are you looking for?
[02:49:23] <muzone> fraserkillip: Cool
[02:49:31] <muzone> fraserkillip: what did you do at that jsfiddle though?
[02:50:41] <androoid> a nivo slider type transition when i click between different tabs
[02:51:10] <fraserkillip> look at the JS, i took away the $(function.... wrappers and incased it all in $(document).ready(function(){ ... }); muzone
[02:51:45] <fraserkillip> muzone: that the ensure the DOM is ready to be jQuery manipulated before anything happens
[02:51:56] <fruitbatinshades> jqueryui tabs issue: I've tryint to use the tabs and they set up and render correctly but the events are never fired! Can anyone see what I'm doing wrong please? http://jsfiddle.net/4bfWH/
[02:52:12] <Kambfhase> fraserkillip: $(fn(){ ...}) and $(document).ready(fn(){ }) are the same
[02:52:51] <fraserkillip> Kambfhase: Really? i have had issues with them before :S
[02:53:05] <Kambfhase> one is just a shorthand for the other
[02:53:57] <creati29> i'm thinking of testing a way of changing content kind of like SSI without having page refreshes, would it work if i had span elements on page, and the different html contents of those span elements as var in external JS files, then when a select option is picked, i use load to load one of the external js files and fill the content of those empty spans - is the theory behind that sound before i spend time putting it into practice?
[02:54:00] <muzone> fraserkillip: It appears that is not the problem - http://home.no/mritz/test still wont work
[02:54:54] <creati29> its just because certain elements like prices i want to be able to change depending on what country they select from options at the top of the screen
[02:55:41] <fraserkillip> muzone: it seems to work for me to the best of my knowledge? the 'black' one should be highlighted and remain, and the other four only one can be selected?
[02:56:54] <muzone> yeah fraserkillip - but still i dont understand why it works in the jsfiddle but not in the index.html
[02:57:06] <muzone> there's some bottleneck in the code somewhere i just can't find it
[02:57:59] <fraserkillip> hmmm, it works for both for me
[02:59:37] <fraserkillip> muzone: why are your scripts in <body> put them in <head>
[02:59:58] <Kambfhase> no, leave them in body
[03:01:03] <muzone> yeah, i think the problem is elsewhere
[03:01:52] <Kambfhase> works for me, btw. what functionality do you expect?
[03:02:41] <muzone> Kambfhase: the black border to surround the color block when clicked
[03:03:11] <muzone> it works in http://jsfiddle.net/4Q88v/ but not http://home.no/mritz/test
[03:03:38] <muzone> Or wait, fuck
[03:03:50] <muzone> Sorry, please hold
[03:04:39] <fruitbatinshades> has anyone had an issue with ui tabs where no events are fired?
[03:06:17] <fraserkillip> fruitbatinshades: i hate all those tabs things that are out, i just make my own from scratch
[03:06:38] <muzone> Kambfhase, fraserkillip - http://home.no/mritz/test/ - does that work?
[03:07:04] <Kambfhase> yes
[03:07:17] <muzone> whaaat?
[03:07:22] <madprops> how can I check if a div exists?
[03:07:31] <Kambfhase> no after refresh
[03:07:46] <Kambfhase> madprops: $('div').length > 0
[03:08:07] <madprops> cool thanks
[03:09:36] <fraserkillip> muzone: no, move your scripts to the <head> section of your HTML
[03:10:07] <Kambfhase> why should he do that?
[03:10:28] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/JJNjT/ why this cause in an error http://jsfiddle.net/JJNjT/
[03:10:36] <rethus> if i remove the linebreaks manualy, it works
[03:11:29] <Kambfhase> fraserkillip: http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2007/07/high_performanc_5/
[03:14:10] <fraserkillip> Kambfhase: wow i did not know that :)
[03:18:18] <rethus> there seems to be hidden special-chars inside
[03:18:43] <rethus> even strip_tags(nl2br($var)); take no result
[03:19:57] <muzone> God damn!!!!!!!
[03:20:01] <muzone> it's my favicons!
[03:20:13] <muzone> why on earth would they stop my js from working..
[03:20:27] <Kambfhase> wtf
[03:21:04] <Kambfhase> rethus: JS has no browser compatible multi line strings
[03:21:12] <muzone> no it isnt them
[03:21:21] <muzone> this damn thing works sometimes and not others
[03:22:06] <Kambfhase> why not set the number of valid radio buttons to like one?
[03:23:24] <muzone> Kambfhase: that number may vary from product to product
[03:23:53] <Kambfhase> mkayy
[03:24:23] <Kambfhase> i have the feeling you are fighting against the browser form auto completion here
[03:25:36] <rethus> Kambfhase: if i do nl2br() for the string before i put him to console.debug, i got this in firebug: http://paste.ubuntu.com/653675/
[03:25:52] <rethus> there seems to be another hidden strange char, which is not \n
[03:26:12] <Kambfhase> <br /> is HTML not JavaScript
[03:26:25] <Kambfhase> convert the linebreaks  to \n
[03:26:52] <muzone> Kambfhase: oh yeah?
[03:27:14] <rethus> Kambfhase: i know, i only have done <br /> to replace and visualize them
[03:27:25] <Kambfhase> o.O
[03:27:28] <rethus> that shows, that there must be another failure
[03:27:55] <Kambfhase> try \\\n
[03:29:10] <rethus> same result
[03:29:47] <rethus> http://paste.ubuntu.com/653677/
[03:30:19] <Kambfhase> more escaping!
[03:30:48] <Kambfhase> it has to loke like this in you browsercode: "DEBUGGER:SQL-Query \n     SLECT * FROM ..."
[03:31:10] <Kambfhase> all on one line
[03:31:34] <muzone> Kambfhase: Can you think of a fix by any chance?
[03:31:46] <Kambfhase> no, i gotta go.
[03:32:05] <Kambfhase> cya
[03:33:23] <rookmoot> just a question, the load callback for jquery ui tabs, if i call it, the tab is reloading, but the 'show' event isn't called after the load is complete ?
[03:40:05] <rethus> mhh escaping is not the solution
[03:43:26] <ecdu> hello! any awesome tooltip plugin for jqurey?

[03:56:49] <bluenavajo> Hi, everyone.
[03:57:55] <bluenavajo> I'm relatively new to jquery and i would like to know if there is way to select the last 20 items of a jquery object. I little help would be very glad :-)
[04:06:23] <fruitbatinshades> bluenavajo: check out slice() http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[04:16:20] <muzone> At http://home.no/mritz/test (http://jsfiddle.net/4Q88v), in Firefox - you can click the color block and a border will appear - but why does it stop appearing after you hit refresh?
[04:20:50] <MF__> Hey
[04:31:12] <A7N> Where can I find info about stop events while another event is happening
[04:31:23] <A7N> ie) stopping hover states during window.scroll
[04:33:22] <rethus> regex-question: why there are no \n found?  http://regexr.com?2ub40
[04:33:50] <rethus> which other char can create a linebreak?
[04:35:32] <Zeddy> i've run into a very weird compability problem, i have a jquerymobile page, and now i added PhotoSwipe to display a mobile optimized image gallery, the problem is that after opening the photoswipe gallery $.mobile.changepage stops working (back button that is): http://www.kokonniemi.fi/guide/index.php/view/map/1/1#page-2
[04:39:14] <A7N> I want to do something like this
[04:39:15] <A7N> $(window).scroll(function(){
[04:39:15] <A7N> 		//STOP ALL EVENTS, Hover mainly...
[04:39:16] <A7N>        event.stopPropagation()
[04:39:16] <A7N> });
[04:44:48] <r3v3rb> anyone able to help find out why this site furan-flex.co.uk becomes unresponsive in IE7?
[04:45:01] <rethus> A7N: use jsfiddle.net or pastebin to post code
[04:45:24] <A7N> ok sure
[04:45:44] <A7N> i love how chrome stops events..... yet all the other browsers dont....

[04:47:55] <Coolyo> anyone having problems animating iframe content ?
[04:48:03] <Coolyo> i mean, moving a iframe down and up
[04:48:59] <Woet> stop swearing Coolyo
[04:49:14] <Coolyo> :o
[04:51:29] <r3v3rb> i hate ie7
[04:51:36] <r3v3rb> with a vengeance
[04:51:53] <Woet> r3v3rb: i've stopped supporting ie 7 and lower
[04:52:04] <Woet> not worth the time
[04:52:10] <blackspotwiggins> Woet, word
[04:52:18] <Lee_msi> i have to support ie6
[04:52:20] <r3v3rb> except i just found out my client has ie7 in their office ?! wtf !
[04:52:21] <blackspotwiggins> i mostly target ie9+
[04:52:24] <Lee_msi> think yourself lucky
[04:52:25] <Lee_msi> :)
[04:52:26] <blackspotwiggins> if ie8 works, great
[04:52:33] <blackspotwiggins> ie7 -> har har im using internets
[04:52:41] <superos> In Firefox 5 I experience a bug with JQuery UI Draggable. A child element of a draggable element will have a scrollbar that trigger tragging when trying to use the scrollhandle (not the up and down arrows) instead of scrolling. In Opera 10 and IE 8 this bug is not present. Anybody know how to work around this?
[04:52:54] <Woet> Lee_msi: then get a better job :P
[04:53:15] <Woet> only 18% of my visitors use IE
[04:53:24] <Woet> and of that 18%, only 2% use ie 7 or lower
[04:53:48] <blackspotwiggins> ie7 is actually the least used
[04:53:58] <r3v3rb> ugh, the problem i have is in the video/html5 stuff and query/video.js
[04:54:01] <blackspotwiggins> ie6 and ie8 usually are much more popular

[04:56:52] <fraserkillip> I have this query: "SELECT * FROM `questions` WHERE MATCH(`entry_content`) AGAINST ('asda');", when i run it it does not throw any errors, and return and empty set. I know that in one of my rows under entry_content i have this string "asdasd". My table is MyISAM and it does have a FULLTEXT index set on entry_content, any ideas of why this doesn't work?
[04:57:24] <molavy> i want every time a ajax complete if response data have key alarmerr alert it
[04:57:32] <molavy> but i don' know how to set .ajaxSuccess for this porpose
[04:57:38] <molavy> i used this code:

[04:57:55] <molavy> 		alert(xhr.responseXML);
[04:57:58] <molavy> any idea?
[04:59:15] <molavy> but it return undefined
[04:59:29] <molavy> alert undefined
[04:59:40] <r3v3rb> any one fancy taking a look at fur an-flex.co.uk and telling me why ie7 spits its dummy out

[05:10:11] <seutje> molavy: it's responseText innit?

[05:14:00] <molavy> i want get json data not Text
[05:16:16] <muzone> geekbuntu: No, sorry. This thing can't really be tested in jsfiddle anyway as a reload there is different to a reload at the home.no testcase

[05:54:12] <kollapse> Hi. This page presents a div that sticks to the top when scrolled down - http://jsfiddle.net/zsJAr/embedded/result/  It works with jquery 1.3.2 but apparently not with the latest 1.6.1/2. Any reason why ?
[05:56:47] <aro> has anyone used jquery.address?
[05:58:58] <qwrty57> is there a way to make on click this.toggleClass but also removeClass('classname') everywhere else?
[05:59:21] <qwrty57> easy way, without going with each();
[06:00:02] <aro> ?
[06:00:25] <jrist> lol what
[06:01:19] <qwrty57> doing pagination. on click, toggleClass('selected'). but want to remove 'selected' class from other element
[06:01:27] <qwrty57> at the same time
[06:01:44] <freeed> qwrty57: $('.slected').removeClass('selected')
[06:01:53] <aro> freeed+1
[06:02:05] <qwrty57> ok cool thanks
[06:02:10] <NoNoNo> aro: Sounds interesting, although I don't really understand the concept yet
[06:02:38] <selckin> it seems impossible to stop mouseenter from bubbling? or am i doing it wrong

[06:25:51] <Gho5t> is it possible to put a jquery selector on multiple lines
[06:28:27] <kborchers> Gho5t: why would you do that? if your selector is really long, there's probably a better way. and no, unless you put that string together with a + before each line break, js won't like it
[06:28:28] <bot-t> (8 hours 5 mins 10 secs ago) <gnarf> tell kborchers I have some strange "half power" -- enough for the laptop / interneet, but not for AC, Stereo, CF Bulbs (standards are working but dim)
[06:29:02] <Gho5t> it's a multiple selector

[06:31:11] <Fox`> i'm adapting a jquery plugin and need to create a trigger for it, so a function can be inserted into the config, but i can't figure out how to pass the output of this function to the plugin itself
[06:31:16] <sadmicrowave> bot-t, sadmicrowave's location is Texas

[06:31:30] <bot-t> sadmicrowave, Texas - Time: 8:31 Thursday (CDT), Weather: Sunny, 27°C / 80°F
[06:31:35] <sadmicrowave> LIES!
[06:31:39] <kborchers> hey sadistwasher ;)
[06:31:44] <sadmicrowave> :)
[06:31:49] <sadmicrowave> hola
[06:32:49] <sadmicrowave> * hey kboardshorts
[06:32:59] <kborchers> heh
[06:33:05] <sadmicrowave> lol
[06:33:07] <Fox`> this might paint a better picture http://pastebin.com/184QcaCU
[06:33:18] <Fox-> o.o
[06:33:36] <Fox`> so the plugin would see if autoSlideStopTrig is true or false and act upon it
[06:33:56] <Fox`> but it's unable to see whether it's true or false
[06:34:33] <Eightamrock> Hey guys QQ what is a faster selection $('#elmid a.classname') or $('#elmid').find('a.classname')
[06:34:47] <Eightamrock> my gut tells me the former not the latter
[06:35:22] <dannN> i think first one is faster.
[06:35:30] <kborchers> Eightamrock: yes, the first is faster
[06:35:42] <Eightamrock> thats what I thought... thanks fellas!
[06:35:48] <kborchers> the second searches all descendants for that anchor
[06:35:56] <kborchers> first only children
[06:36:02] <Eightamrock> and it instantiates another method which is unnecessary
[06:36:11] <Fox`> is this even possible?
[06:36:21] <cooler> hello #
[06:36:22] <Eightamrock> makes sense
[06:36:41] <cooler> any chance to get jquery-bbq-plugin into jquery core ?
[06:37:26] <cooler> or at least the hashchange event...
[06:37:46] <sadmicrowave> Fox`, I'm not sure if it is possible the way you are trying it.  I'm envisioning something more like this.is(':hovered') <-- invalid syntax but you get the idea
[06:40:19] <sadmicrowave> Fox`, which carousel plugin are you using?
[06:40:33] <Fox`> it doesn't have a name
[06:40:54] <tman> if jquery.js?ver=1.6.1 is being called in my header how come i can't use the shorthand $ ?
[06:41:21] <Kambfhase> tman: something else might be using the $. Prototype, Mootools?
[06:41:57] <tman> Kambfhase: http://maheen.tman.ca it's using a WP setup
[06:42:15] <sadmicrowave> Fox`, what if you had a separate element binding for $('.slidewrap').hover() in which you put $(this).carousel({autoSlideStopTrig: [true/false]}) when the user hovers and leaves
[06:42:18] <Kambfhase> i think WP calls .noConflict() by default
[06:42:28] <sadmicrowave> Fox`, instead of trying to put the hover within another function
[06:42:58] <Fox`> could do
[06:43:00] <sadmicrowave> Fox`, err, not $(this) but $('.slider')
[06:43:16] <Fox`> i'm just gonna hard code the trigger
[06:43:46] <sadmicrowave> ok
[06:44:02] <Kambfhase> tman: a simple trick: jQuery(document).ready(function($){ << not the $. it allows you do use the $ in your code as usual
[06:44:27] <sadmicrowave> *note
[06:44:34] <tman> oh
[06:44:36] <tman> right on man
[06:44:40] <tman> thanks!
[06:44:56] <Kambfhase> np
[06:44:59] <Kambfhase> sadmicrowave: yeah

[06:47:53] <Derppy> Is there any way to find out which functions are executed by certain jQuery event? Trying to quickly figure out how this very script-heavy site works and I'd like to have something like a click function that would alert me the names of all the functions that got invoked by it.
[06:48:10] <sadmicrowave> R.I.P bot-t
[06:49:04] <sadmicrowave> Derppy, that would be cool if there was (none that I know of)
[06:49:26] <Kambfhase> Bot-t sacrificed him self to save us!
[06:50:01] <sadmicrowave> Bot-t, you will always be in our memories
[06:50:13] <sadmicrowave> mamories?
[06:51:29] <Aamir> jeeten:  ask here
[06:51:51] <Aamir> jeeten:  plz no PM
[06:51:54] <Derppy> sadmicrowave: Indeed, or any other way to quickly check which functions activate when I do something on the site. There's a ton of script and it's not very clear, so just reading it to know what happens when I click some elements is rather painful.
[06:52:15] <jeeten> hello every one
[06:52:25] <delinquentme> anyone happen to have a guess as to why a jquery script which doesnt get called on load in FF .. DOES get called on page load in IE?
[06:52:50] <sadmicrowave> Derppy, go to each function that you see in the js and add an alert( 'myfunctionname' )
[06:52:51] <jeeten> can any body help me
[06:52:55] <Aamir> ?p @delinquentme
[06:53:15] <Aamir> ?ask @jeeten
[06:53:18] <Gho5t> in jqgrid, is there a way to show "..." in a column when text is truncated?
[06:53:24] <sadmicrowave> Aamir, the bot left
[06:53:26] <sadmicrowave> :(
[06:53:27] <Kambfhase> ?fail @ Aamir
[06:53:30] <sadmicrowave> lmao
[06:53:32] <Aamir> :/
[06:53:44] <delinquentme> Aamir, im guessing thats not enough info :P?
[06:54:07] <sadmicrowave> delinquentme, no thats not enough information
[06:54:20] <Aamir> delinquentme: jse jsfiddle.net for a demo/code
[06:54:27] <Aamir> use* :$
[06:55:11] <delinquentme> ok nm that theres too much code
[06:55:21] <delinquentme> how about general loading behaviors in IE
[06:55:44] <selckin> why does opening a dropdown trigger mouseleave :/
[06:55:46] <delinquentme> can one prevent it from running all the js code on load?
[06:55:56] <sadmicrowave> delinquentme, can you put the contents of your <head> tags in a pastebin at least?
[06:57:06] <sadmicrowave> Kambfhase, wtf, will bot-t come back?
[06:57:26] <Kambfhase> he is in robot heaven now, i guess
[06:57:34] <sadmicrowave> poor little guy
[06:57:38] <bjensen> how can I check if my checkbox has been checked? element.val() == '1' always returns true
[06:57:52] <Aamir> bjensen:  is(':checked')
[06:57:53] <Kambfhase> .is(':checked')
[06:57:55] <sadmicrowave> if( $('mycheckbox').is(':checked') )
[06:58:01] <Aamir> i won :D
[06:58:11] <Kambfhase> mycheckbox is not a name
[06:58:13] <bjensen> ahh thanks guys
[06:58:25] <Derppy> sadmicrowave: Ok, well I'm such a noob I don't know how I can force my browser to ignore specific script and load one that I want instead. I've only injected some script, but never actually replaced whole files.
[06:58:38] <Derppy> Oh and that's not jquery-related, sorry ;)
[06:58:41] <sadmicrowave> Aamir, yea but you are still at 0 points because you did a 'fail' earlier, administered by Kambfhase
[06:59:27] <delinquentme> sadmicrowave, so the particular jquery in question is http://jsfiddle.net/e8v5t/  seekers.js in that head tag
[06:59:28] <sadmicrowave> Derppy, I guess I'm confused, if you don't want your browser to load it.....then don't include it
[07:00:49] <sadmicrowave> delinquentme, and seekers.js isn't loading?
[07:01:14] <Derppy> sadmicrowave: It's not my site, I'm just trying to find out how it works and if I want to add alert to all the functions like you suggested. However, that would kind of require me to take the whole script, do some find and replace magic and then load the page with my script instead.
[07:01:50] <delinquentme> sadmicrowave, nah it loads just fine .. however theres a particular function within that which fires onload ... when in any other browser its simply loaded into DOM
[07:01:53] <delinquentme> and not run
[07:02:04] <sadmicrowave> Derppy, even IF there was a jquery function for what your asking, you would have to do some script editing in this case also
[07:02:07] <Briareos1> I am toggling an element with .toggle() - however it's low down on the page so to view the contents the user has to manually scroll even further down  -
[07:02:23] <mattp_> hey dudes. where do you look for jobs?
[07:02:24] <Briareos1> can I have jQuery to scroll in order to put the whole element into the view?
[07:02:38] <mattp_> im trying to hire a jQuery frontend dev, not sure where the javascript hotspot to post is though
[07:03:18] <delinquentme> im pasting in some bits of the jquery
[07:03:27] <sadmicrowave> delinquentme, wheres your jquery core?
[07:03:43] <Gho5t> in jqgrid, is there a way to show "..." in a column when text is truncated?
[07:03:59] <delinquentme> its in there :D
[07:04:13] <delinquentme> lol that would have been an awesome issue if thats what was doing it :D
[07:04:14] <sadmicrowave> Briareos1, see .scrollTo
[07:04:29] <sadmicrowave> delinquentme, where?
[07:04:33] <sadmicrowave> paste the line
[07:04:51] <sadmicrowave> oh no, I see it now..next to google-analytics
[07:05:00] <delinquentme>     <script type="text/javascript" src="/javascripts/jquery.js?1309451404"></script>
[07:05:06] <delinquentme> yeah weird tabbing .. updating
[07:05:16] <Briareos1> sadmicrowave: so only possible via plugin?
[07:05:23] <sadmicrowave> delinquentme, what are all these '1309451404' at the end of your file names?
[07:05:30] <Kambfhase> Gho5t: try one of these plugins: http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/ellipsis
[07:05:34] <delinquentme> they're rails tokens
[07:05:47] <sadmicrowave> Briareos1, perhaps .scroll(), I think that is a built in plugin
[07:05:49] <jeeten> hello
[07:05:58] <jeeten> can any body help me
[07:06:00] <delinquentme> that prevents hotlinking and its part of the built in auth system :D
[07:06:15] <delinquentme> so the delete_detail is the function which is being run on load
[07:06:26] <sadmicrowave> ok, just as long as they are supposed to be there
[07:06:41] <jeeten> i have question how can iget a filed value having same name and reapeted in a loop
[07:06:42] <delinquentme> now it is being called by 2 items below .. however those were commented out ... and it still ran all by itself
[07:06:57] <sadmicrowave> delinquentme, can you post the .ready() line of your seeker.js and then the function in question also?
[07:07:06] <sadmicrowave> brb
[07:07:16] <jeeten> ok
[07:07:24] <jeeten> $(document).ready(function(){  	$('.comic_rss_data').click(function(){ 			alert("hi i am here");	 			 			var vis_in=$('a .set_visitor_info').attr('rel'); 			alert(vis_in); 		}); 	 	});
[07:07:41] <delinquentme> sadmicrowave, yeah they're both there ... lemme remove more cruft
[07:08:12] <Kambfhase> Though shall not paste code in IRC. Rule nr 45
[07:08:57] <jeeten> hello
[07:09:12] <jeeten> any body can help me
[07:09:20] <jeeten> hi every one
[07:09:32] <Kambfhase> jeeten: please rephrase you question
[07:10:53] <jeeten> i want to find the field value with has id as xyz and it cuming up by loop
[07:12:03] <Kambfhase> $('#xyz') << this gets you the element with the id xyz
[07:14:08] <janis> Hi! I need some help with selectors! How to select all elements of class="MYCLASS" that contains elements of class="OTHER"?
[07:14:34] <Aamir> $('.MYCLASS .OTHER') ?
[07:14:45] <hassan> hi all - I'm using an ajax call which works fine, however, I don't like the "Loading..." message which shows up. I'd just like to keep the text prior to clicking the button which calls the load function-  how can I do this?
[07:14:47] <kborchers> janis: $(".MYCLASS").has(".OTHER");
[07:14:48] <Kambfhase> $('.other').closest('.myclass')
[07:15:17] <Derppy> Might not be the right place for this, but maby you people know. Do any laws prevent you from creating userscripts and custom stylesheets for websites and sharing them?
[07:15:18] <janis> But not as direct child.. Will check.. TY
[07:15:50] <Aamir> Derppy: jsfiddle.net
[07:16:12] <Aamir> ohh.. sorry dif questions
[07:16:19] <Aamir> question*
[07:17:11] <kborchers> janis: has is what you want
[07:17:14] <kborchers> ?has @ janis
[07:17:15] <bot-t> janis, .has(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[07:17:31] <Kambfhase> Derppy: userscritps are legal i guess since you only modify locally
[07:18:07] <mattp_> hey dudes. where do you look for jobs?
[07:18:08] <mattp_> im trying to hire a jQuery frontend dev, not sure where the javascript hotspot to post is though
[07:18:43] <hassan> nvm, I'm an idiot.
[07:18:44] <Derppy> I mean, can some company sue you if you make userscrips and custom stylesheets for their site? Not making anything extreme, but there's this alpha version of a gaming site and I asked one of the developers if I'm allowed to create userscripts and custom stylesheets for it. He said "Nope :)"
[07:19:13] <Derppy> Just thinking if it's a "No, we'll ban your account if you share them" or "No, we'll sue you if you share them" :D
[07:19:43] <Kambfhase> How should they find out and why should they sue you?
[07:21:20] <Derppy> I don't know, I just asked and he said no, so I thought maby I should ask if there's any actual legal issues with it or if they just don't like people improving their site.
[07:21:45] <Derppy> Like if it's safe to share such scripts with your own name or not
[07:25:36] <janis> kborchers: bot-t: and others TY, did it.. I also needed .prev(), to get sibling before searched element. BTW, happy to see so great community here!
[07:28:34] <philosophia> if an item in select input is selected, i want to add an element to the dom - is there a jquery method that would help with this?
[07:28:59] <kborchers> ?change @ philosophia
[07:28:59] <bot-t> philosophia, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/

[07:33:35] <sara> Hi Guys
[07:33:37] * kborchers gives bot-t some more coffee
[07:33:45] * eml gives bot-t some coffeescript
[07:33:46] <sadmicrowave> wtf is that?
[07:34:09] <sara> I want to display the Datepicker above the Textbox, anyone have any solution ?
[07:34:11] * sadmicrowave gives bot-t some java-script <-- eh! get it!
[07:34:53] <kborchers> sara: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-showOptions
[07:35:02] <Kambfhase> ?lmgtfy coffeescript @ sadmicrowave
[07:35:02] <bot-t> sadmicrowave, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=coffeescript
[07:35:26] <sara> thank you kbochers
[07:35:52] <sadmicrowave> Kambfhase, lol shutup
[07:36:04] <delinquentme> so why would a script be running on load .. instead of when invoked
[07:36:18] <joon> hi, can't find how to load ajax content in a new tr element someone who can help ?
[07:36:21] <delinquentme> "because its IE " s an acceptable reply .. howevs not helpful :P
[07:36:24] <joon> here the code http://pastebin.com/JiV8eUYq
[07:36:28] <sadmicrowave> delinquentme, did you ever paste your script code in a pastebin?
[07:36:36] <delinquentme> sadmicrowave, yeah i trimmed it up for you as well
[07:36:46] <goldstar> hi guys,when making a json post request, in the callback I check for various data items. the problem is if a given data item doesnt exist i get an undefined error. how do I aviod this ? e.g.
[07:36:48] <goldstar> if(result.errors.name.isEmpty) alert('failed'); // prints undefined error
[07:36:50] <delinquentme> the ready() is in there http://jsfiddle.net/e8v5t/1/
[07:36:57] <Kambfhase> code always runs on load. unless you delay it
[07:37:39] <Kambfhase> goldstar: you have to check if each individual element exists nasty, but thats the way to go
[07:37:52] <kborchers> joon: $(this) is not the tr anymore in that situation. you need to set var that = $(this); before the ajax call then do that.after(data); in your success callback
[07:38:10] <KOTRET> is there a way to select all divs not having an onclick attribute? like an inversion of $('[onclick]')
[07:38:22] <Kambfhase> if( result && result.errors && result.errors.name && result.errors.name.isEmpty){
[07:38:31] <joon> thx for helpo kamb !
[07:38:33] <sadmicrowave> delinquentme, which part is running when it 'shouldnt be'?
[07:38:39] <Kambfhase> ?not @ KOTRET
[07:38:40] <bot-t> KOTRET, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[07:38:44] <delinquentme> delete_details
[07:38:54] <KOTRET> ah cool thank you
[07:38:56] <goldstar> Kambfhase: ouch, do i really have to do ALL of that ??
[07:39:00] <delinquentme> delete_detail
[07:39:44] <Kambfhase> goldstar: yeah. there might be a shortcut in some futureversion of JS for this
[07:40:01] <sadmicrowave> delinquentme, the delete_detail that is attached to the .live() click?
[07:40:08] <c4rl> brbs
[07:40:23] <delinquentme> true. but those were commented out and the error still existed
[07:40:39] <sadmicrowave> delinquentme, whats the errror?
[07:41:01] <delinquentme> its looking for the "item" argument in the details
[07:41:08] <delinquentme> its not getting passed it
[07:41:20] <delinquentme> i mean the function doesnt get a value for that so its like .. derrrp
[07:41:22] <sadmicrowave> Kambfhase, http://verydemotivational.memebase.com/2010/12/19/demotivational-posters-death-ray/
[07:42:37] <sadmicrowave> delinquentme, take the function definition out of this js and put it in it's own .js file like DeleteDetails.js and make sure you don't wrap it in $(document).load() or $(document).ready()
[07:43:38] <delinquentme> then call it from the document .. and where would the reference to the DeleteDetails.js go inside the file that were looking at?
[07:43:54] <sadmicrowave> no, in your <head> tags as another script link
[07:44:57] <sadmicrowave> delinquentme, when putting the script link in your head tags make sure you add it BEFORE your seeker.js script ref or when you call .delete_details in seeker.js it won't find the function
[07:45:07] <sara> Hi kborchers, the following link has no suuficient information about positioning the date picker http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-showOptions
[07:45:16] <delinquentme> ohhhhhh
[07:45:19] <delinquentme> its that easy huh
[07:45:19] <sadmicrowave> :)
[07:45:24] <sadmicrowave> we will see
[07:45:31] <sara> I want to display the Datepicker above the Textbox, anyone have any solution ?
[07:47:43] <seutje> bentruyman: what's this I see?
[07:47:48] <sadmicrowave> sara, can you use the create: option to add a function like $(this).css({top: '-100px'});

[07:48:33] <opie_> sara, does datepicker use the position api?
[07:48:43] <sara> Thank you sadmicrowave, let me try
[07:49:36] <oxez> Hello. I have a 'change' event bound to a dozen checkboxes. I'd like that event to be fired if I change the checkbox 'value' manually with $(".checkbox").attr('checked', 'checked'). What would be the best way to do that?
[07:50:26] <bentruyman> HI seutje !
[07:50:45] <opie_> sara, i got something for you one sec
[07:50:48] <quicksilver> oxez: call $(".blah").click() instead ?
[07:50:54] <delinquentme> ok sadmicrowave so delete_detail.js simply contains the entirety of that function and nothing else ...  and the reference to that file was added before the primary file ... verifying functionality in FF right now
[07:51:12] <sadmicrowave> delinquentme, sounds good so far
[07:51:22] <delinquentme> ha thats hot
[07:51:28] <sadmicrowave> :)
[07:51:32] <delinquentme> damn thats cool i totally never though that would work
[07:51:38] <delinquentme> ok /.. IE!
[07:51:58] <sadmicrowave> delinquentme, I always put my plugins in their own files
[07:52:14] <seutje> bentruyman: OHAI, thanks for the heads up, got me some shit to download now :)
[07:52:26] <delinquentme> lol well thats one of our devs
[07:52:29] <bentruyman> seutje: :)) hope you likey
[07:52:36] <seutje> oxez: u can just .attr('checked', true)
[07:52:41] <delinquentme> donno if thats good or bad .. anyways .. same error .. on the new line number corresponding to the same missing item
[07:52:44] <oxez> quicksilver: yeah I can do that. I just tried it now, making sure I uncheck them all and then call .click(), but the change event isn't fired
[07:52:54] <seutje> bentruyman: dunno, first track I heard was to my liking...
[07:52:58] <delinquentme> item argument from within delete_details that is
[07:53:12] <seutje> bentruyman: AND YOU'RE NOT UPLOADING ANY OTHERS >_<
[07:53:15] <delinquentme> it really does seem like those two .lives would account for that
[07:53:26] <oxez> seutje: yes, but that doesn't fire the change event, at least for me
[07:53:27] <bentruyman> seutje: I think I uploaded like 4 or 5
[07:53:30] <Kambfhase> ?down jsfiddle.net
[07:53:37] <seutje> oxez: naturally
[07:53:38] <bot-t> Kambfhase, It's not just you! - http://jsfiddle.net looks down from here.
[07:53:53] <seutje> $(':text').val('foo') doesn't fire change either
[07:54:04] <kborchers> jsfiddle has been terrible lately
[07:54:06] <seutje> .attr('checked', true).trigger('change')
[07:54:12] <seutje> oxez:  ^
[07:54:42] <oxez> seutje: awesome, thanks
[07:54:47] <sadmicrowave> delinquentme, I'm out of ideas mr.
[07:55:19] <Kambfhase> js fiddle ist hot shit. srsly awesome and crappy at the same time.
[07:55:28] <delinquentme> sad :D
[07:55:36] <delinquentme> sadmicrowave, :D can i kill it
[07:55:39] <delinquentme> prez?
[07:55:46] <sadmicrowave> yes
[07:57:12] <quicksilver> oxez: ok, live and learn :) I expected click to fire change..

[08:08:27] <yurakeshi> Lee_msi, i added the button and set the command, but when i press the button it doesn't execute the command
[08:08:34] <sara> I want to display the Datepicker above the Textbox, anyone have any solution ?
[08:08:49] <opie_> sara are you a bot?
[08:09:19] <tomasm-> can anyone recommend an EASY to use content slider, where I have a navigation bar and clicking on them slides different blocks of content back and forth into view? perhaps something that can load content from separate pages via ajax
[08:10:05] <Lee_msi> ah right, dont know, cant help, i aint needed to do that sort of plugin yet. make sure the files are being included e.c.t is all i can say.
[08:10:37] <opie_> alright, well i'm not going to work on that then, sara
[08:10:58] <opie_> regardless i suggest using http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/ to reposition the datepicker
[08:12:22] <opie_> hmm, took a quick look at the source i don't think the datepicker is using the position api, it may not work
[08:12:42] <opie_> it should work, but who know. jquery ui datepicker feels very clunky to me
[08:13:02] <kborchers> tomasm-: you can use UI tabs http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/ and the fx option allows for the animation
[08:13:39] <kborchers> opie_: no, i don't think datepicker uses position which is one reason why it is currently in a rebuild
[08:14:42] <tomasm-> kborchers, hmmm, sounds good, though where do i read more on the effects available?

[08:19:14] <tomasm-> hmmm, can that do a sliding transition where the old content moves over as the new one moves in? all I see is something similar to a blinds effect, not quite what I'm looking for
[08:21:15] <tomasm-> i see the slide effect on jqueryui.com/demos/effect, which is what i want, but also want to slide OUT the old content

[08:23:57] <nitrospectide> is this proper syntax for eliminating margins on the body element inside an iframe with the id #paylease? $('#paylease body').css("margin","0");
[08:27:43] <Skizu> Hey o.o
[08:27:51] <jqUser> hello
[08:28:01] <jqUser> So here is the issue.
[08:28:08] <Skizu> I've a php question which ##php are too ignorant to help with o.o think anyone could help ?
[08:28:12] <NoNoNo> nitrospectide: try $('#paylease').contents().find('BODY).css("margin","0");
[08:28:43] <jqUser> jQuery UI draggables are able to scroll the parent conainer.
[08:28:53] <jqUser> How can I get a draggable to scroll a container OTHER THAN the parent?
[08:29:17] <NoNoNo> nitrospectide: http://jqapi.com/#p=contents
[08:29:29] <jqUser> I have a scrolling container but some draggables need to be visible outside of this container (which has overflow: auto).
[08:29:48] <jqUser> so I cannot append these draggables to this container (nor use the "containment" property, for that matter).
[08:30:09] <jqUser> I would like it if the draggables scroll this container fully before being able to leaves its confines.
[08:30:14] <Kambfhase> jqUser: use the appendTo option of the draggble
[08:30:17] <jqUser> Have tried many things but nothing seems to pan out.
[08:30:28] <NoNoNo> nitrospectide: Works only if main page and IFRAME are on the same domain.
[08:30:43] <jedimind> jqUser, keep track of the draggable, and when the scroll reaches top/bottom, then move it in the DOM to outside that container
[08:30:59] <nitrospectide> NoNoNoNo: Ah... this is a hosted 3rd party service in the iframe
[08:31:05] <jqUser> Kambfhase: if I append these draggables to the scrolling container, then these draggables are not visible when they are being dragged outside of this container (since the container has oveflow auto).
[08:31:09] <bjhaid> i am trying to make a jquery ajax request to my backend, i expect my backend to receive it as a post request but it gets there as a GET request anyway i can alter this?
[08:31:32] <Kambfhase> why not appendTo body?
[08:31:49] <nitrospectide> NoNoNo: so what can I do, then?
[08:31:58] <jqUser> jedimind: changes to the DOM tree do not seem to make a difference until after the drag has ended
[08:32:35] <jedimind> thats not true
[08:32:37] <NoNoNo> nitrospectide: If different domains you simply can not access the IFRAME from the parent page with JS
[08:32:42] <jedimind> changes to the dom can be made for each pixel the mouse moves
[08:32:53] <supsup> is this a replacement for delegate?  http://bit.ly/poT7H5
[08:33:15] <supsup> how do you test which is less resource entensive?
[08:33:31] <nitrospectide> NoNoNo: ugh
[08:33:38] <supsup> intensive*
[08:33:49] <NoNoNo> nitrospectide: Get over it
[08:33:52] <jqUser> jedimind: even so, the threshold case seems buggy
[08:34:05] <jqUser> jedimind: produces dodgey edge cases
[08:34:30] <NoNoNo> nitrospectide: This is to protect users from stealing cookies, passwords, identities etc
[08:34:34] <jedimind> i overcame a similar scenario (with overflow hidden / boxes needed to stick out of it) but dynamically adjusting the height of the overflow element
[08:35:04] <jqUser> I'm dealing with horizontal and vertical scrolling
[08:35:31] <jqUser> don't have the luxury of changing the dimensions of the scrolling container element
[08:35:57] <nitrospectide> NoNoNo: OK. It just stinks that the vendor tells you to iframe their UI, but then added extra margin that now makes the UI no longer fit. Ah, well. Crappy vendor the client picked.
[08:36:00] <jedimind> do you have an example of this thing up somewhere so we can understand visually what youre trying to do?
[08:36:18] <jqUser> Unfortunately not.. and it's for work.
[08:36:28] <jqUser> So they might not appreciate putting up the code.
[08:36:29] <jedimind> cant setup a testcase?
[08:36:40] <jqUser> yes, I should be able to.
[08:36:41] <jqUser> hmm
[08:36:43] <jqUser> okay
[08:36:54] <jqUser> thanks, I'll try to get something up
[08:36:58] <jedimind> np
[08:38:34] <NoNoNo> nitrospectide: Would be nice if vendor lets you specify an URL of your custom CSS, that he will include then in his pages.
[08:40:06] <nitrospectide> NoNoNo: that would make too much sense. the sales-bot who answered the phone had to walk down to the tech guys and ask to even understand what I was talking about. HE called back and told me , sorry no can do. So their hideous table-icious layout is served as-is
[08:40:44] <NoNoNo> nitrospectide: :)
[08:41:29] <bazz> is there a recommended way to fire off a number of jQuery.get requests and then wait for them all to finish?
[08:41:47] <Skizu> $_SESSION['user'] loses all its data after login, http://codepad.viper-7.com/62L0eo class, http://codepad.viper-7.com/WjBZqJ login script
[08:41:50] <bazz> (don't want to serialize each request, just want to only do something when all have completed)
[08:41:51] * Skizu cough
[08:42:06] <supsup> bazz u could set them all to nonsyncronize for the lawls
[08:42:25] <supsup> or u could have boolean on successes and keep polling to see if all 3 booleans are true for the lawls also
[08:42:29] <delinquentme> variable without a value in jquery .. it is undefined ... or nil?
[08:43:08] <NoNoNo> bazz: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[08:44:06] <Kambfhase> delinquentme: there is no nil in JS
[08:44:13] <Kambfhase> only "nil"
[08:44:27] <bazz> supsup: yeah, thought of that.  seems ugly, but it would work.  polling seems gross
[08:44:30] <bazz> NoNoNo: thanks
[08:44:31] <delinquentme> Kambfhase, awesome big abrams tanks!
[08:44:32] <NoNoNo> bazz: http://iainjmitchell.com/blog/?p=496
[08:45:03] <supsup> NoNoNo idea is good
[08:45:16] <supsup> i'm still stuck on 1.4.2 so i don't have defers ;-/
[08:45:37] <NoNoNo> sorry to hear that...  :)
[08:45:38] <supsup> way to rub it in NoNoNo
[08:45:43] <supsup> jk
[08:45:50] <supsup> i read that article before -- forgot about it lols
[08:45:55] <supsup> prob tried to so i would not cry
[08:46:22] <Kambfhase> instead of three booleans use one int
[08:47:16] <muhdick> hi hi
[08:47:16] <bazz> yeah, NoNoNo's method seems nice and elegant, thanks
[08:47:47] <muhdick> can an object be assinged to a string?
[08:47:57] <muhdick> i mean a complex object with properties
[08:48:00] <muhdick> and all that
[08:48:13] <muhdick> togo = togo.url
[08:48:16] <muhdick> like that
[08:48:32] <NoNoNo> muhdick: like that: var s = 'hello'; s = {};
[08:49:06] <muhdick> well there seems to be a bug in jquery mobile beta
[08:49:24] <NoNoNo> muhdick: just use the issue tracker
[08:50:02] <NoNoNo> muhdick: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues
[08:50:08] <Kambfhase> what do you mean by "assigning an object to a string"?
[08:50:10] <delinquentme> heyy heres a new one .. so ive got a variable that isnt even being defined ... is there a way i can test this behavior?  IE  .. if its defined .. do something .. if its not ( throwing an error ) do another thing?
[08:50:12] <kborchers> muhdick: you could also see if anyone is awake on #jquerymobile
[08:50:19] <muhdick> ok
[08:50:24] <muhdick> well i mean this
[08:50:46] <Kambfhase> delinquentme: if( typeof vari == "undefined") do stuff
[08:51:31] <NoNoNo> delinquentme: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Special/typeof
[08:52:21] <delinquentme> Oh typeof
[08:52:31] <delinquentme> i substituted 'string' lulz
[08:52:56] <NoNoNo> typeof null == 'null'  â oh didn't know that
[08:53:10] <NoNoNo> typeof null == 'object' Â 
[08:54:50] <muhdick> http://nopaste.info/252705a454.html
[08:54:58] <muhdick> i mean
[08:55:02] <muhdick> see in that code
[08:55:12] <muhdick> it says
[08:55:18] <muhdick> toPage = toPage.url;
[08:56:45] <NoNoNo> muhdick: you can reassign a var at any time - and change its type in this reassignment
[08:58:15] <NoNoNo> muhdick: var a = { 'b': 'c' }; a = a.b; RESULT: 'c'
[09:00:03] <philosophia> http://pastebin.com/ND1yFuAf so i have a change() function that for any selects on a page with name='questionType*'.  it looks like this function only works for the first select on the page
[09:00:07] <muhdick> huh?
[09:00:12] <muhdick> how is it c?
[09:00:21] <philosophia> am i not matching the select name correct?
[09:01:33] <quicksilver> philosophia: selects are not inputs?
[09:02:09] <NoNoNo> muhdick: This is how associative arrays, called objects in JS, work
[09:02:20] <philosophia> i pasted the wrong code.  check pastebin now
[09:03:07] <philosophia> http://pastebin.com/9AXW0K6e
[09:03:30] <philosophia> this is only matching the first select on the page that has a name that contains 'questionType'
[09:04:33] <quicksilver> philosophia: why do you have .change(); at the end?
[09:04:36] <delinquentme> typeof item != ('shard' || 'experience')  am i doing this right?
[09:04:36] <tomasm-> is there a way to use the UI tabs in a vertical list (on the left), and to have multiple lines of text (ie a title and a description), instead of just a simple tab
[09:04:38] <quicksilver> I think that may be confusing you.
[09:04:57] <Kambfhase> delinquentme: no
[09:05:07] <delinquentme> derp yeah
[09:05:07] <quicksilver> the .change() at the end will trigger it on the first element only.
[09:05:07] <delinquentme> i got it
[09:05:30] <NoNoNo> muhdick: Or like your example: var toPage = { 'url': 'http://example.com/' }; toPage = toPage.url;Â RESULT: 'http://example.com/'
[09:05:57] <philosophia> i commented out the change() at the end but its still only matching the first select http://pastebin.com/yH0ySubi
[09:06:33] <glen1> hey all
[09:06:39] <Kambfhase> the code looks ok. is the rest of your page online?
[09:08:39] <karega> is there anyway to get the contents of a script file using jQuery?
[09:12:55] <jaredhoyt> hey guys, i was in here a week or two ago asking about running an animation after two other asynchronous animations had completed
[09:13:26] <jaredhoyt> i figured out my solution... i duck-punched the fn.animate() method to wrap it with a deferred
[09:13:30] <jaredhoyt> http://jsfiddle.net/jaredhoyt/jjFRX/1/
[09:13:32] <quicksilver> philosophia: we have no hope of helping you without a working demo on jsfiddle or at least your HTML code
[09:13:53] <quicksilver> philosophia: there is nothign wrong with what you wrote so the problem is somewhere else.
[09:14:58] <jaredhoyt> the only downside of doing it this way is that you lose your original jquery object context, but the upside is it will now use deferreds for all methods utilizing .animate()
[09:15:23] <jaredhoyt> e.g. $('div').fadeOut().done(function(){ $(this).remove(); });
[09:20:17] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: you there?
[09:23:11] <delinquentme> ok guys heres a scenario: I have a function which is accepting in arguments ( this one in particular is accepting "item" )  .. so when the function gets invoked .. and no value for "item" is provided ... "item" should then indeed have a        typeof item == 'undefined'    // true
[09:23:13] <delinquentme> right?
[09:23:45] <Kambfhase> yeah
[09:23:58] <delinquentme> and what if its not
[09:24:04] <delinquentme> is there anything else it might be?
[09:24:10] <delinquentme> because thats not behaving as its supposed to
[09:24:14] <Kambfhase> its not undefined in that case
[09:24:37] <delinquentme> hmmm
[09:24:43] <Kambfhase> paste your whole code
[09:24:48] <delinquentme> lol i feel like one of those inception comics right now
[09:34:04] <b-lew> can i grab some help. I'm not for sure if its a jquery or css issueâ¦ http://pcandmacrepair.com/Â -> for some reason my dropdown navigation works in ie7 but does NOT work in ie8â¦ thoughts? same with the slider
[09:36:04] <Paganini> Im using IE8 and it's working
[09:36:09] <Paganini> well testing with Ie8 :P
[09:36:24] <b-lew> i wonder why its not working for me
[09:36:26] <Paganini> oh wait, no sorry, wrong browser
[09:36:29] <Paganini> I beg your pardon...
[09:36:40] <b-lew> haha phew i thought i was going crazy for a sec
[09:37:33] <zamabe> I have an element being created by CSS with the :after psuedo class. How should I go about setting an event for when it comes into existence so I can modify it?
[09:37:35] <b-lew> its a wordpress theme.
[09:37:37] <impi> hello, i was wondering if anybody here is using / used jquery selectmenu?
[09:37:50] <impi> i am having a focus issue, that is in the latest release
[09:38:46] <delinquentme> when i get an error in console ( IE ) saying "expected identifier"  .. what does this mean
[09:39:04] <delinquentme> i've been operating under the presumption it means " there is no value for this variable"
[09:39:17] <Kambfhase> it means you syntax is wrong
[09:40:00] <rson_> can someone here please confirm that https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/visual/button/button.html and http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tests/visual/button/default.html appear differently in ie 8 (at least) and possibly comment on issue #5254?  the last comment suggests a wontfix, however the tests in the project are clearly broken..
[09:40:01] <Paganini> well my ie8 in dev tools (take this as a pinch of salt) says: if(b.styleSheet){b=b.styleSheet;b.addRule the ;b.addRule break was unexpected
[09:40:11] <tomasm-> with ui tabs, is there a way to have a slide effect for content that is being replaced by a new tab's content? ie as the new content slides in, the old content slides out
[09:41:12] <tomasm-> rather, have the old content slide left and the new content slide left too (not old sliding right as it seems to be)
[09:44:50] <b-lew> Paganini: is that fixable at all? I'm not seeing that.
[09:45:01] <b-lew> but I don't have dev tools for ie8
[09:45:45] <Paganini> to be fair I think it's IE just coughing up SOME error...
[09:45:57] <Paganini> I don't think IE's dev tools are really much to go by :P
[09:46:11] <b-lew> haha ok
[09:46:21] <Paganini> but that's what happened when I ran the start debug tool and refreshed the page
[09:46:36] <b-lew> so there is something goin on ie specific. weird
[09:46:38] <jaredhoyt> b-lew: what do you mean you don't have dev tools for ie8? someone steal your f12 key?
[09:46:44] <b-lew> its a elegant wordpress theme
[09:47:02] <b-lew> let me check to see if that works one sec jaredhoyt
[09:47:28] <b-lew> crazy i didn't know that existed
[09:47:29] <b-lew> cool
[09:47:42] <jaredhoyt> b-lew: don't get too excited, they suck
[09:47:46] <Paganini> see! :D
[09:47:53] <b-lew> lol
[09:48:09] <sgrover> Need help with the start of a custom plugin.  See http://jsfiddle.net/Wwgef/.  When I include the standard closure lines, I'm getting errors..
[09:48:12] <b-lew> is there any way to fix that error then?
[09:48:43] <jaredhoyt> sgrover: you've not providing arguments for your self-executing method :p
[09:48:52] <jaredhoyt> add (jQuery) to the very end before your ;
[09:51:58] <jaredhoyt> man, i thought someone would be excited about my jsfiddle, i thought it was cool :p
[09:53:38] <sgrover> jaredhoyt: crap.  Thanks.  I knew it'd be something stupid
[09:55:56] <Paganini> b-lew sorry bro I have a butchers through the ie8 dev console but wordpress turns the whole thing into such a mishmash I can barely make heads or tails of it :/
[09:55:56] <sgrover> Next question.  My plugin has to be referred to afterwords.  I was hoping to do something like $("#myid").twpmap().getLocations();  How would I set that up?
[09:56:10] <sgrover> Or is there a better way, or some reason I shouldn't be doing that...
[09:56:44] <Paganini> b-lew this might be one for the wordpress channel if they have one
[09:56:45] <sgrover> I think doing what I want breaks chaining...
[09:57:15] <b-lew> Okay I'll try there again, no one was helping out in there
[09:57:29] <b-lew> Thanks for taking a look Paganini I really appreciate it!
[09:57:39] <Paganini> b-lew if you're using a theme, somebody must have had the same problem before....
[09:57:41] <jaredhoyt> sgrover: you're correct, that would break chainability ... your methods should be accessible through $(selector).plugin('method');
[09:57:52] <Paganini> b-lew did you customise it in any way?
[09:57:54] <jaredhoyt> sgrover: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[09:59:14] <b-lew> I'm helping out a friend, I think it might have jacked with something but I backed up the theme and replaced files with the original like the header.php and css files and i didn't have any luck
[09:59:37] <Paganini> b-lew so you reverted back to the original and it doesn't work then?
[09:59:48] <b-lew> he claims he just messed with the css a bit
[10:00:06] <b-lew> not fully back to the original
[10:01:27] <sgrover> jaredhoyt: I've seen that page.  I'm not clear on how to call my plugin with a method name OR options.
[10:01:57] <sgrover> basically not clear on the difference between initializing the plugin, and then later calling it for a specific method.

[10:11:15] <sgrover> jaredhoyt: think I got it.  testing now.  One of those times where you have to "do it" to understand it. :)  Thanks for the pointers.
[10:12:25] <Kambfhase> sgrover: http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[10:15:00] <tomasm-> anyone familiar with getting jquery UI tabs to do decent sliding transitions ,like how coda slider works? Coda slider works perfectly but the required html/css structure is too much for my tastes - jquery ui's tabs are less overhead but i cant quite figure out the sliding in/out of content like coda slider does so easily...
[10:15:54] <karega> anyway that I can post cross domain using AJAX and expect a response?
[10:16:17] <Kambfhase> JSONp
[10:24:30] <Zeddy>  is there a way to hide the browser scrollbar? :P

[11:15:49] <supsup> you need to add in external resources for validator etc.
[11:15:58] <Xeon06_> kborchers: Wow, hadn't thought of that. Thanks
[11:17:22] <Xeon06_> Oh, it's the tab itself. I need the panel. And those aren't styled. For now I just get all panels and use the selected ID as an index. Not sure how good that is

[11:18:00] <fkm> Hello. I would like to submit a HTML form through jQuery. Everything looks fine (the form is in the HTML and children().val() gives me the right value). But somehow the field and it's value don't make it to the "action" destination. Here's the Javascript http://diaspora.freeiz.com/likeit2/buttongen.js and here's the HTML http://diaspora.freeiz.com/index2.htmll
[11:18:33] <fkm> I couldn't find anything useful on Google, so I guess I'm doing something fundamentally wrong
[11:18:34] <flipmoe> hi, how can i unload a script for example superfish? thx
[11:19:23] <fkm> Does someone have an idea, what could be the reason for my data loss?
[11:19:50] <supsup> fkm: how does that html have anything to do with your js?
[11:19:56] <supsup> there is no refrence to it at all
[11:19:57] <fkm> PS: The target PHP script has just an echo for the HTTP_REFERER and two var_dumps for $_GET and $_POST.
[11:21:47] <fkm> supsup: Sorry, my bad! Here's the right link http://diaspora.freeiz.com/index2.html
[11:22:04] <fkm> The reference to the js-file is in the HTML header.
[11:23:14] <supsup> your selectors are odd to me , perhaps i just do them oddly tho
[11:23:57] <supsup> why are you appending this stuff why not just have it in html directly?
[11:24:04] <fkm> Considering my JS-skills, I'd say, I'm doing them odly :-)
[11:24:25] <graphikz> hey, why is the jscroll on http://home.irollbitches.com/cube_final/index.html not working? I'm not getting any errors or anything, it just doesn't smooth scroll
[11:24:30] <supsup> do u not have access to the html or something?
[11:24:42] <wesada> Hello all.
[11:24:53] <wesada> I have a question about live.
[11:25:02] <supsup> all these appends seem pointless.  also the way ur doing onclick is odd too
[11:25:08] <graphikz> actually nvm
[11:25:34] <atriv> how can i get individual list elements from a selectable. as opposed to all selectable text concatenated i.e. (result = $( "#selectable1 .ui-selected" ).text();)?
[11:25:59] <fkm> supsup: At the moment, I do have access. But yes. The idea is that everyone can embed this button, just by including the js-file and adding the a-tag with the right class to the HTML.
[11:26:12] <supsup> ok fair enough
[11:26:23] <supsup> not accessible tho
[11:26:50] <fkm> I had it working fine with GET. But I don't want to use GET, because the crawlers could mess up the count
[11:26:59] <wesada> I have a jqUI Datepicker I am cloning and on each clone I call trigger on a live with a custom event to call datepicker again.  This works fine for the first clone, but not for the second, third etc.
[11:29:34] <fkm> supsup: My best guess was, that the submit button/link/whatever needs to be in the <form> tag itself. But then I wouldn't know how to submit the right form (as there might be multiple on one page - as on the example).
[11:30:20] <kborchers> ?demo @ wesada
[11:30:21] <bot-t> wesada, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:30:45] <wesada> kborchers: Just in the process actually...
[11:30:51] <supsup> fkm would u not need to append the links also to the page then tho?
[11:33:26] <fkm> Well.. I wrapped the forms around the a-tags and appended the hidden input to the form-tag. So: <form><input/><a/></form>
[11:33:53] <jaredhoyt> fkm: hidden submit buttons will not work in some browsers ;)
[11:34:01] <jaredhoyt> you can however position it off the screen
[11:34:02] <fkm> With onclick="submit();" it worked like a charm in rekonq but not in Firefox
[11:34:33] <fkm> jaredhoyt: That sounds like a plausible cause! Thank you :-)
[11:34:48] <Yoplitein> does .get not return data when the page returns a 400 response code?
[11:34:53] <jaredhoyt> fkm: why are you using inline event handlers with jQuery? why not $('a').click(function(){ $(this).parents('form').submit(); });
[11:34:59] <fkm> But if they don't work: Do they redirect to the target URI without data or does nothing happen?
[11:35:28] * fkm <-- New to jQuery and never really good at Javascript
[11:35:42] <fkm> I will thry this! Thank you :-D
[11:36:37] <Yoplitein> or does that have something to do with the JS object jQuery uses?
[11:37:40] <jaredhoyt> Yoplitein: are you using firebug or chrome extensions?
[11:37:47] <ajpiano> Yoplitein, get doesn't fire the success callback on a 40x error
[11:37:48] <jaredhoyt> you should be able to see exactly what's returned
[11:38:12] <jaredhoyt> Yoplitein: you could use always() instead... $.get(...).always(function(){});
[11:38:12] <Yoplitein> right, that's what I suspected
[11:38:17] <ajpiano> Yoplitein, if you want to handle the error case, you can use $.ajax or do $.get("url",data, fn).error(function() { });
[11:38:21] <ajpiano> or dat
[11:38:35] <Yoplitein> alright, I'll try .error
[11:38:38] <Yoplitein> thanks
[11:38:54] <phishbot> anyone have any preferences on solid PHP frameworks? currently looking at CakePHP, CodeIgniter
[11:39:06] <jaredhoyt> phishbot: cakephp is nice, orm doesn't use objects though
[11:39:21] <jaredhoyt> phishbot: might look at Lithium as well if you want cutting edge
[11:39:25] <phishbot> ah
[11:39:29] <karega> ajpiano, if a site is not sending over data in jsonp is there anyway I can get it via an asynch post?
[11:39:33] <phishbot> will look into it now, thanks jaredhoyt
[11:40:05] <sonotos> symphony2 was released
[11:40:21] <sonotos> symfony
[11:40:54] <jaredhoyt> cake2 is almost out as well
[11:40:56] <supsup> karega : maybe using 1.5+ jquery u can u do like type: "jsonp text"
[11:41:03] <supsup> depends if data is acceptable format
[11:41:46] <itsgreen> I use (target).load(url) to use a url in a div, is there a smart way to let url know in what div he is in?
[11:41:49] <fkm> jaredhoyt: The parent-thing works fine. Thanks again for that!
[11:41:49] <Yoplitein> does .error() pass any arguments?
[11:42:08] <karega> supsup, what if the data is just xml
[11:42:19] <fkm> Unfortunately the POST data still doesn't make it to the target-script. But I'll check if maybe something is wrong there. Be back later :-)
[11:42:22] <ajpiano> Yoplitein: the args it would have gotten, i believe
[11:44:18] <Yoplitein> well, what I want to do is get the server output regardless of error code it returns
[11:44:32] <Yoplitein> status code, rather
[11:44:45] <jaredhoyt> Yoplitein: then use .always()
[11:45:02] <jaredhoyt> Yoplitein: .always() will occur regardless if your deferred is resolved or rejected
[11:45:47] <jaredhoyt> ajpiano: take a gander at this sweetness :) - http://jsfiddle.net/jaredhoyt/jjFRX/1
[11:45:51] <Yoplitein> so, $.get("page", {args}).always(data).always(function(data) {}) ?
[11:46:00] <Gho5t> anyone know of a fix for the ie 7 jquery autocomplete enter key bug
[11:46:15] <jaredhoyt> Yoplitein: no, .get('page', {args}).always(function(response){});
[11:46:25] <Yoplitein> mmk
[11:48:06] <wesada> kborchers:http://jsfiddle.net/cuRyz/
[11:49:28] <kborchers> wesada: you can't have the same id on multiple elements
[11:49:40] <kborchers> [] means nothing to js in the id
[11:50:32] <Gho5t> anyone know of a fix for the ie 7 jquery autocomplete enter key bug
[11:50:49] <wesada> kborchers: So I should 86 the id?
[11:51:01] <jaredhoyt> wesada, kborchers: why not http://jsfiddle.net/jaredhoyt/cuRyz/1/ instead
[11:51:29] <kborchers> jaredhoyt: that still doesn't work right
[11:51:34] <jaredhoyt> not an id fix, wasn't paying attention to that... was just cleaning up the code :p
[11:51:47] <jaredhoyt> no need for a custom event
[11:52:51] <itsgreen> I use (target).load(url) to use a url in a div, is there a smart way to let url know in what div he is in? Perhaps some jquery quote I can run on the urlpage that checks what div it's in?
[11:54:28] <vacho> c.offset is undefined
[11:54:30] <vacho> what does that mean??
[11:54:46] <Gho5t> it has no value
[11:54:48] <wesada> kborchers: I think you see what I'm trying achieve.
[11:55:00] <vacho> im getting that error in my jquery.js file
[11:55:03] <wesada> The page I'm working on is a timesheet entry form.
[11:55:07] <kborchers> wesada: i do, just trying to work out a solution
[11:56:52] <Gho5t> can anyone recommend an autocomplete plugin since the jqueryui one doesn't work in ie.
[11:57:00] <necromancer> vacho: probably something you failed to pass to jQuery somewhere, and it's only apparent now
[11:57:05] <necromancer> Gho5t: jQuery.tokeninput
[11:57:16] <itsgreen> vacho, probably isn't jquery itself, but some code you made thats causing an error inside the jquery file. Try to comment pieces of code until you have figured out whats causing it
[11:57:18] <vacho> im just loading jquery
[11:57:28] <vacho> k
[11:58:22] <Gho5t> necromancer: why isn't it coming up in the plugins search
[11:58:35] <necromancer> Gho5t: i don't know, google it
[11:59:00] <necromancer> vacho: do you have any other JS running on the page except jquery.js?
[11:59:10] <vacho> ya a bunch
[11:59:12] <vacho> it's wordpress
[11:59:18] <vacho> no way I can find this problem
[11:59:53] <Sean-Der> Hello I am using .remove() to allow the removal of a <div> is there a function that if a user pressed a button could add the div back, without allowing someone to spam the <div> and create it a million times
[11:59:54] <Gho5t> this thing sucks
[11:59:59] <Gho5t> doesn't work in ff or ie
[12:01:58] <kborchers> wesada: clone is too messy there with all of the data and events added by datepicker. try this http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/cuRyz/2/
[12:05:13] <Gho5t> i don't get it - is this a plugin or part of jquery ui? http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.8/Autocomplete
[12:05:49] <tomasm-> is there an easy way to see which LI (the array index relative to the UL container) that a click on a link is in?
[12:06:05] <kborchers> Gho5t: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[12:06:40] <Gho5t> yeah that one wasn't working in ie 7
[12:06:41] <kborchers> and yes, that link you had is the UI version but this is the doc to look at for help
[12:06:48] <Gho5t> whenyou hit enter
[12:06:52] <Gho5t> but is now
[12:06:59] <Gho5t> i think
[12:07:26] <tomasm-> or perhaps is there a way to see, given an element, what index child it is in the parent?
[12:08:13] <kborchers> tomasm-: $("theLI").index() will give you the index in relation to its siblings
[12:08:23] <tomasm-> kborchers, thanks
[12:09:00] <tsunammis> hi all
[12:09:05] <kborchers> did that work for you wesada?
[12:10:11] <Aaragorn> anyone familliar with how to manage subscriptions (recurring payments) on paypal from a website? how do you determine the current status of the subscription?
[12:10:18] <wesada> kborchers: If you remove the name attribute it doesn't work properly.  I did fix it though.
[12:10:18] <wesada> http://jsfiddle.net/cuRyz/
[12:10:32] <Ogredude> oh sweet!  I'm building an autocomplete search field in my app.  I've gotten it to return a JSON object containing an array of results.  I'm not sure what to do from here.  It looks like when it finds matches, it pops down a <ul> under the textfield like it's supposed to, but I'm not sure how to tell it what to be in the <li>'s for the search results.
[12:11:20] <kborchers> wesada: is that your most recent fiddle cuz it no worky
[12:11:54] <wesada> kborchers: Sorry forgot to copy the new link.
[12:11:55] <wesada> http://jsfiddle.net/cuRyz/3/
[12:12:02] <kborchers> Ogredude: why not just use http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[12:12:21] <Stockholder> Good afternoom
[12:12:42] <kborchers> wesada: cool, as long as you don't need an id at some point later ;)
[12:13:51] <flipmoe> can someone help me with this little viewport script, please? http://jsfiddle.net/AeeGX/ thx
[12:15:01] <Ogredude> kborchers:  because I'm not really sure what I'm looking at.
[12:15:25] <kborchers> Ogredude: that is the autocomplete widget from jQuery UI ... why reinvent the wheel?
[12:15:58] <Ogredude> kborchers:  yeah, that's what I'm trying to use, dude.  It does the xhr requests, it gets json objects back from the server.  Now what?
[12:16:21] <Ogredude> it does not render an autocomplete list.  And I need it to actually populate the form fields when something's selected.
[12:16:31] <kborchers> link?
[12:16:41] <Ogredude> so I'm thinking I need to set up a select handler, but I'm not sure
[12:17:45] <kborchers> Ogredude: you will need to bind to the select event but you have to have a list first. see ?demo
[12:17:46] <bot-t> Ogredude, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:18:18] <cats4gold> Does anyone know why IE9 does not want to process this get? $.get(todo.attr("data-href"), function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) { alert("foo"); } );
[12:18:45] <cats4gold> if you dont pass in the textStatus and jqXHR, ie9 will process the get.
[12:18:50] <cats4gold> It's erally strange
[12:18:53] <cats4gold> reallyz8
[12:18:58] <cats4gold> really*
[12:19:54] <Ogredude> bot-t:  can't link to site, it's internal only.  Not sure how to reproduce it on jsfiddle as it relies on a Rails backend to feed it data.
[12:19:55] <bot-t> Ogredude, Concentrate and ask again.
[12:20:12] <kborchers> ?imabot @ Ogredude
[12:20:12] <bot-t> Ogredude, -5 geek points for not noticing I am a bot.
[12:20:34] <Ogredude> kborchers:  I'm not seeing anything in the demo or documentation on how to deal with the incoming JSON object and rendering it into a list of items.
[12:20:41] <blaamann> I am looking at the source code of a page and I can see scripts tag with both '$(document).ready(function()...etc' and with 'jQuery(document).ready(function($)...etc' Can someone explain to me why? Actually I see several script tags with  '$(document).ready(function()...etc' .
[12:20:43] <delinquentme> is this going to derp on me:        if ( item == 'experience' || of_type == 'objective' || of_type == 'summary' ) {  }??
[12:20:47] <Ogredude> That's my next step, if I need a list before I can build the select handler.
[12:21:27] <wesada> kborchers: Thanks for helping me out.  I've just signed up for jsfiddle.  It'll be my first stop next time. :)
[12:21:36] <kborchers> Ogredude: if you know the JSON is coming back, make a fiddle with static data that mimics the JSON data to narrow it down to a single issue
[12:22:00] <Ogredude> kborchers:  ok let me see if I can figure out this fiddle thing
[12:22:14] <kborchers> wesada: definitel a good tool when it's up. been a little crappy lately. if it is down, jsbin.com is a great alternative
[12:22:53] <ryanneufeld> jsfiddle super slow for anyone else today?
[12:23:11] <kborchers> ryanneufeld: has been slow all week
[12:23:17] <ryanneufeld> fuck
[12:23:38] <Segaja> hi, is it possible to show some loading image in the tabs of jQuery UI Tabs if i use ajax tabs?
[12:27:41] <Ogredude> yeah, screw it.  I have no clue how to use this fiddler thing.
[12:28:04] <Ogredude> can't decipher the docs, can't get help without that tool, can't figure out that tool.
[12:28:39] <Ogredude> don't know how to define static json data
[12:29:04] <Ogredude> so I'm kinda stuck.
[12:29:21] <wesada> Ogredude: Does the JSON come back to your browser?
[12:29:55] <Ogredude> wesada:  yep
[12:30:14] <Ogredude> I don't know how to tell the autocomplete widget which parts of the JSON data to put into the <li> tags it builds
[12:30:19] <wesada> Just copy and paste the JSON to a variable and reference in the JS on fiddle
[12:31:58] <RikudoSennin> hey guys, question, I've $.posted some data and recieved feedback, now I want to select specific elements from that feedback (function(data) {}) and append it to elements
[12:32:13] <RikudoSennin> how can I select ".stage2_table" from data?
[12:33:47] <RikudoSennin> anyone?
[12:34:21] <Ogredude> ok putting this on pause
[12:34:26] <Ogredude> have to demo the system
[12:36:59] <sadmicrowave> RikudoSennin, what format is 'data'?
[12:37:02] <sadmicrowave> json?
[12:37:10] <RikudoSennin> html string
[12:37:52] <sadmicrowave> make data into an object by doing var $data = $(data); then you can select by doing $data.find('.stage2_table')
[12:38:19] <sadmicrowave> or just $(data).find('.stage2_table') <--without storing it to a variable
[12:40:10] <vacho> if I accidently load jquery UI twice, will it break??
[12:40:18] <sadmicrowave> vacho, no
[12:40:33] <vacho> .autocomplete is not a function
[12:40:37] <Snerf> I am trying to $(this).resizable( "option", "aspectRatio", parseFloat(width/height) );  , but when I resize, the aspectRatio is not being fixed, width and height are valid
[12:40:38] <vacho> it's def loaded
[12:41:16] <sadmicrowave> vacho, what do you mean by 'accidentally'? either you put it in your <head> tags or you don't
[12:41:22] <vacho> no
[12:41:29] <vacho> in wordpress that's not the case
[12:41:34] <vacho> stupid plugin creators load whatever they want
[12:41:36] <Kambfhase> why do you parsefloat AFTER you have done a division?
[12:41:53] <sadmicrowave> Kambfhase+
[12:42:00] <vacho> bbl
[12:42:06] <Snerf> Kambfhase, doesnt seem to matter either way, it doesnt work
[12:43:15] <sadmicrowave> vacho, can you post the results of parseFloat(width/height)
[12:46:49] <DannyZB> guys guys guys .. give me a cool name for a development blog
[12:46:59] <chriskjennings1> what's the best way to say "every x seconds, do this function" ?

[12:48:53] <DannyZB> jquery / php / css
[12:48:59] <DannyZB> and sometimes some java and c++
[12:49:06] <DannyZB> anything connected to web-based development
[12:49:12] <DannyZB> but the name can be unrelated
[12:49:14] <sadmicrowave> chriskjennings1, var iCnt = 0; setInterval(function(){ if(iCnt == 5) executeThis; ++iCnt }, 1000);
[12:49:23] <DannyZB> There's a blog named "cats who code" thats pretty cool heh
[12:49:30] <sadmicrowave> DannyZB, no
[12:49:39] <Kambfhase> Es0teric: indexOf returns -1 if a string was not found!
[12:49:41] <chriskjennings1> Kambfhase, sadmicrowave: thanks
[12:50:08] <sadmicrowave> chriskjennings1, the above will do executeThis() every 5 seconds
[12:50:19] <sadmicrowave> oh sorry...no it wont
[12:50:29] <Kambfhase> "manual override" would be a cool dev blog title
[12:50:36] <sadmicrowave> chriskjennings1, var iCnt = 0; setInterval(function(){ if(iCnt == 5){ executeThis; iCnt=0;} ++iCnt }, 1000);

[12:51:23] <Kambfhase> ?TIAS
[12:51:24] <bot-t> Try It And See
[12:51:33] <sadmicrowave> :) nice
[12:51:42] <DannyZB> lol
[12:51:50] <DannyZB> and what if it loses money you pay 10%?
[12:51:58] <Kambfhase> haha
[12:52:27] <sadmicrowave> DannyZB, what about 'douches who ask too many questions'?
[12:52:32] <Es0teric> kambfhase, it worked... but it was if(urlA === 1){//execute code here}
[12:52:39] <DannyZB> thats cool
[12:52:43] <sadmicrowave> ^^not in reference to you
[12:52:48] <DannyZB> I'll end up using that XD
[12:52:58] <DannyZB> I have a name idea
[12:53:02] <DannyZB> jQuery NOOBS
[12:53:06] <DannyZB> or
[12:53:07] <DannyZB> jQuery NOOBS rule
[12:53:07] <DannyZB> haha
[12:53:12] <sadmicrowave> NooooOooOOOOoo
[12:53:17] <Kambfhase> Es0teric: did you mean -1 ?
[12:53:24] <DannyZB> DTM
[12:53:27] <DannyZB> Death to Microsoft
[12:53:27] <Es0teric> no no no, kambfhase, i mean 1
[12:53:29] <sadmicrowave> DannyZB, do you want people to go to your site?
[12:53:46] <DannyZB> lol I'm good in writing guides/tutorials
[12:53:46] <Kambfhase> Thats err, weird.
[12:53:48] <sadmicrowave> DannyZB, then don't name it something that makes it sound like you don't know anything about the topic
[12:53:58] <eddiemonge> whats wrong with Microsoft? They have some awesome products
[12:54:04] <DannyZB> Most blogs have names unrelated to the topic
[12:54:10] <Es0teric> kambfhase, it works the same way with !== -1
[12:54:15] <DannyZB> Whats wrong with microsoft? one word :  .NET
[12:54:24] <Kambfhase> F# is awesome!
[12:54:33] <DannyZB> C# is the worst thing to ever happen to programming
[12:54:33] <sadmicrowave> ?Bill Gates
[12:54:35] <DannyZB> it's aweful
[12:54:39] <bot-t> sadmicrowave, Saturday, 2011-06-25 - http://services.jquery.com/#jquery_20110625.log.html
[12:54:40] <Es0teric> kambfhase, the reason why it works with === 1 is because its saying if its EQUAL to 1
[12:54:40] <DannyZB> awful * lol
[12:54:44] <sadmicrowave> lol
[12:54:53] <Es0teric> !== -1 is the same... not equal to -1
[12:55:09] <Kambfhase> yeah, fine.
[12:55:14] <rubknob> is it possible to do something like $("#id1", "#id2").foo(); ?
[12:55:32] <Kambfhase> $("#id1, #id2").foo()
[12:55:38] <Es0teric> kambfhase, my question is... is there a easier way to do this instead of writing urlA-Z including # as variables?
[12:55:52] <sadmicrowave> $("#id1," + " #id2").foo();
[12:55:59] <rubknob> awesome.  thanks guys
[12:56:44] <Kambfhase> pretty sure there is. What do you want to do?
[12:57:27] <DannyZB> I have a name idea
[12:57:31] <DannyZB> Dannys blog XD
[12:57:39] <Es0teric> kambfhase, the idea is that whenever the url is "firstletter=[letter here]" to highlight the corresponding letter in css, to show that the user is on the page corresponding with the letter in the url
[12:57:53] <Kambfhase> thats easy, wait a moment
[12:58:02] <Es0teric> alright
[13:00:18] <fragy> Hi. I'm trying to hide a div, change it contents and then show it up again. Everything works fine except that, even though using the .delay function, I see the content change before the div gets totally hidden. What can I do? Here's the code: $("#someDiv").slideUp().delay(3000); $("#someDiv").html('testing'); $("#someDiv").slideDown();
[13:00:32] <DannyZB> To the new guys : what are you having trouble with most in jQuery? I'll write something about it
[13:01:12] <Kambfhase> Es0teric: try this: http://pastie.org/2286228
[13:01:14] <sadmicrowave> fragy, $('#someDib").slideUp(500,function(){$(this).html('testing')});
[13:01:29] <kborchers> DannyZB: based on what i see a lot in here, the biggest issue is reading stuff written about jQuery
[13:01:31] <fragy> <sadmicrowave>, ok, gonna try it. Thanks.
[13:01:36] <sadmicrowave> fragy, put the html() function within a callback of slideUp, which will execute when slideUp is through
[13:01:40] <kborchers> or the lack there of
[13:01:41] <DannyZB> lol
[13:01:53] <DannyZB> kborchers : the problem then is complicated guides
[13:02:09] <DannyZB> more examples less long tutorials (:
[13:02:21] <kborchers> i don't think the actual docs are that complicated :/
[13:02:41] <Kambfhase> yeah, write something about reading the fucking docs
[13:02:42] <sadmicrowave> people just don't read the docs before they ask questions and start freaking out
[13:03:06] <Es0teric> kambfhase, that code is nice, but is there any way you can slice the firstletter= to just accept the one letter for $('.letter-'+ letter).css( objCss); ?
[13:03:25] <sadmicrowave> over half the crap I've seen requires an EXTREMELY simple google search...so maybe you need to educate people on how to use google
[13:03:26] <Kambfhase> oh, fuck
[13:03:38] <kborchers> also, they always want you to write it for them
[13:03:42] <kborchers> ^^^
[13:03:53] <Es0teric> kambfhase, so it could be $('.letter-A').css( objCss); ?
[13:04:04] <Kambfhase> yeah, totally forgot about that
[13:04:35] <Kambfhase> http://pastie.org/2286243
[13:04:37] <Kambfhase> fixed
[13:04:46] <sadmicrowave> Yay! Kambfhase !!
[13:04:52] <DannyZB> lol Kambfhase you gave me an idea
[13:04:57] <DannyZB> I'll write a tutorial about reading docs
[13:05:01] <Es0teric> ah, alright, thanks kambfhase
[13:05:04] <DannyZB> then we can send the new guys there XD
[13:05:05] <Kambfhase> :D
[13:05:40] <Es0teric> PERFECT
[13:05:40] <sadmicrowave> DannyZB, if the initial problem is NOT reading the docs...what makes you think people are going to read something about how to read something they are not already reading?
[13:05:43] <Es0teric> lol
[13:05:50] <kborchers> DannyZB: make sure it's a video or audio tutorial though cuz you know these folks wont read it
[13:06:00] <Gho5t> when i click the enter button on a textbox the page gets updated. in firebug, how can i see what function is being fired?
[13:06:03] <sadmicrowave> kborchers++
[13:06:05] <kborchers> sadmicrowave++
[13:06:07] <sadmicrowave> lol
[13:06:08] <kborchers> lol
[13:06:11] <sadmicrowave> stop it
[13:06:16] <DannyZB> lol
[13:06:16] <kborchers> get out of my head
[13:06:17] <Es0teric> now i got another question, kambfhase, the background-color property on objCss works... but the color property doesnt... why is that?
[13:06:31] <Es0teric> .css() should accept hex values for color right?
[13:06:32] <DannyZB> haha kborchers
[13:06:34] <Kambfhase> dunno
[13:06:36] <sadmicrowave> kboardshorts - you first!
[13:06:46] <kborchers> sadistwasher - no you
[13:06:46] <DannyZB> I'll write a -total- beginners guide to jQuery
[13:06:48] <DannyZB> for example
[13:06:51] <DannyZB> "google it" : explaination
[13:07:12] <eddiemonge> Gho5t: is it being done with jquery? use firequery
[13:07:16] <sadmicrowave> OooOo DannyZB if your going to write a beginners guide to jQuery - it should be about javascript!
[13:07:26] <kborchers> sadmicrowave+++++++++
[13:07:29] <Gho5t> can't use firebug to see?
[13:07:30] <eddiemonge> +1
[13:07:35] <sadmicrowave> :)
[13:07:43] <Kambfhase> JavaScript? Yeah, Oracle just released version 7 today, didnt they?
[13:07:45] <sadmicrowave> I can't explain it, these things just come to me naturally
[13:07:51] <DannyZB> no thats too advanced XD
[13:07:54] <DannyZB> I'll write about using the keyboard
[13:07:57] <DannyZB> searching online
[13:07:59] <DannyZB> and reading documents
[13:08:14] <Kambfhase> reading? whats that?
[13:08:17] <DannyZB> it's 90% of the work lol
[13:08:20] <DannyZB> reading -
[13:08:20] <Kambfhase> something to eat?
[13:08:21] <eddiemonge> Gho5t: you can but only if you know the events attached to that element. you could use the console to see that i guess
[13:08:30] <sadmicrowave> Kambfhase, lol
[13:08:48] <DannyZB> tens of thousands of years ago our ancient ancestors were nomads .. hunter- gatherers
[13:09:04] <DannyZB> in order to better communicate and work together they developped more and more sophisticated forms of speech
[13:09:09] <necromancer> before the dawn of man as we knew him
[13:09:20] <sadmicrowave> DannyZB,  I'm all ready bored
[13:09:26] <sadmicrowave> already*
[13:09:42] <DannyZB> thats because you already know how to read
[13:09:47] <DannyZB> think about a total reading noob
[13:09:48] <sadmicrowave> DannyZB, see...I just stopped reading
[13:09:49] <Kambfhase> I think I#ll write something about how to help on #jquery
[13:09:50] <DannyZB> who reads about it XD
[13:10:00] <Gho5t> nice
[13:10:20] <sadmicrowave> Kambfhase, will it be a long document?
[13:10:24] <kborchers> Kambfhase: i can write that in one line
[13:10:29] <kborchers> ?rtfm
[13:10:29] <bot-t> http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page is your friend
[13:10:35] <sadmicrowave> I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO SAY THAT!!!
[13:10:40] <sadmicrowave> err...type that*
[13:10:50] <Kambfhase> no, helping is about asking the right questions
[13:11:13] <kborchers> Have you read the manual? Is that the right question?
[13:11:13] <necromancer> wrong
[13:11:25] <sadmicrowave> kborchers++
[13:11:31] <DannyZB> ok now seriously guys
[13:11:33] <eddiemonge> this is a pointless conversation
[13:11:34] <necromancer> helping is offering your experience on whatever situation is presented
[13:11:36] <DannyZB> if someone is a noob
[13:11:42] <DannyZB> of course he's gonna ask stupid questions
[13:11:45] <DannyZB> thats what a noob is ><
[13:11:55] <necromancer> there's a difference between asking a stupid question, and asking a question stupidly
[13:11:59] <DannyZB> you were all there at some time
[13:12:03] <sadmicrowave> necromancer++++++
[13:12:04] <DannyZB> so teach them
[13:12:20] <necromancer> "how i make flashy website" is not a question, in ANY language
[13:12:25] <Kambfhase> but what is he asks a question you cant answer?
[13:12:27] <sadmicrowave> lmao
[13:12:30] <kborchers> DannyZB: in all seriousness, you should write something about selectors. people rarely know how to "get" what they want
[13:12:32] <Kambfhase> *if
[13:12:34] <necromancer> it just makes me think you have fucking downs syndrome
[13:12:41] <trose> looking for some help. I just started using the jQuery plugin printElement. It works fine and all but in my debug console it is throwing errors from remote scripts. Upon further inspection the scripts seem to be from ad agencies. Firstly, I'd like to know where he might be hiding these in the script and secondly, is this against jQuery policy? should i report this?
[13:12:45] <Gho5t> eddiemonge: so i would want to look in the keydown event to see what is going on when the enter button is pressed?
[13:12:46] <DannyZB> kborchers : my home page is a blog about selectors
[13:12:49] <necromancer> so i'm not going to waste my time helping you understand something you'll never get because you have an extra chromosome
[13:12:53] <DannyZB> one sec i'll show you
[13:12:54] <DannyZB> it's pretty cool
[13:13:10] <sadmicrowave> I hate blogs personally
[13:13:15] <necromancer> trose: yes please report it to stevejobs@apple.com
[13:13:17] <necromancer> trose: ;)
[13:13:51] <Es0teric> kambfhase, for some reason the # doesnt highlight...
[13:13:53] <eddiemonge> Gho5t: sure
[13:14:06] <necromancer> trose: check your firebug net, do you have any other scripts on the page?
[13:14:09] <Kambfhase> Es0teric: wow, i bet that sucks, eh?
[13:14:28] <Es0teric> yeah, it does...
[13:14:48] <trose> necromancer, hahaha but seriously, the scripts are hiding a 1x1 px transparent ad on my site and i can't find where he is seeding the urls. The only other scripts on the page are mine.
[13:15:09] <eddiemonge> trose: then look in the source code
[13:15:28] <trose> source: https://raw.github.com/erikzaadi/jQueryPlugins/master/jQuery.printElement/jquery.printElement.js
[13:15:29] <sadmicrowave> trose, firebug -> html tab
[13:15:41] <cIaO> Hello, there. I need to load an high number of images, but to speed up the page I'm trying to load them after the page loading. Using this script: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/9OC5CvdIkzlBauIo2vdq/ but it seems to require too many time (4.3kib of data), is there a better algorithm to load few images per time or it's all up to the browser?
[13:15:45] <eddiemonge> trose: i didnt say link to the source, i said look in it lol
[13:16:06] <trose> yes, i've been doing that. I can't find any suspicious urls though
[13:16:15] <trose> are there other tricks it could be using?
[13:16:21] <necromancer> trose: wow. that plugin is straight shit.
[13:16:23] <eddiemonge> cIaO: its pretty much up to the browser. maybe you could try a lazy loading like facebook does
[13:16:30] <necromancer> (in terms of how they decided to code it)
[13:16:35] <Gho5t> i just see some functions
[13:16:36] <DannyZB> guys check out : http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize/
[13:16:39] <trose> necromancer, hehe figures
[13:16:44] <DannyZB> it's a super-good tutorial about selectors
[13:16:49] <Kambfhase> Es0teric: http://pastie.org/2286295
[13:16:53] <DannyZB> kambfhase check it out
[13:16:59] <Gho5t> how can i step through what happens when i click the enter button on an input so i can see what is being fired that is updating somethign on my page
[13:17:05] <eddiemonge> cIaO: also, that script isnt actually doing anything
[13:17:23] <necromancer> trose: what's the filename of the 1x1 image
[13:17:42] <necromancer> and where is it requesting the image from?
[13:17:47] <necromancer> (fully-qualified URL)
[13:17:50] <cIaO> eddiemonge: what if I need to display images on a mouse event? I cannot make the user wait for the image...
[13:18:00] <trose> necromancer, this is one of them  document.write('<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wfp.org/donate/hoa_banners?icn=rubicon-appeal&ici=horn-of-africa\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://assets.rubiconproject.com/static/psa/2.png\" alt=\"Support WFP\"></a>
[13:18:01] <trose> ');
[13:18:04] <cIaO> eddiemonge: what? It downloads all the images btw...
[13:18:19] <Gho5t> without putting alerts all over my shit
[13:18:36] <Es0teric> kambfhase, still doesnt work - on my url, the # shows up as %23
[13:18:40] <Es0teric> because i used urlencode() in php
[13:19:09] <necromancer> trose: ...whoever wrote that is trying to link to the world food program?
[13:19:11] <necromancer> lol
[13:19:11] <eddiemonge> cIaO: maybe you should be rethinking how to display the images
[13:19:12] <cIaO> eddiemonge: how should i download images? Btw firebug tell me it downloads all images as expected, after page loading
[13:19:13] <necromancer> what
[13:19:26] <trose> necromancer, dude i don't even know
[13:19:36] <necromancer> trose: don't use that plugin...it's got document.write() in it
[13:19:38] <cIaO> eddiemonge: do you have any example? It's like a 3d view
[13:19:40] <eddiemonge> Gho5t: console.log() or use firebugs/cwt to step through the code
[13:19:43] <necromancer> document.write WILL fuck up on IE
[13:19:46] <Kambfhase> Wow, that selector tutorial sucks. a) if i want to read about seletorcs i use the specs b) most of them are useless c) it does not tell people how to create fast selectors, beacause they dont tell how selectors are parsed
[13:19:49] <trose> necromancer, okay
[13:19:55] <necromancer> trose: sorry man =(
[13:20:03] <necromancer> trose: what does that do, allow you to print from an iframe?
[13:20:05] <trose> necromancer, any better ways to make the browser print?
[13:20:25] <eddiemonge> trose: i dont see that code putting in a link so its probably something else on your site. got a link?
[13:20:33] <trose> necromancer, it allows you to do $(element).print and it only prints the element contents
[13:21:02] <Kambfhase> Es0teric: http://pastie.org/2286320
[13:21:18] <DannyZB> it's more easily readable than the specs
[13:21:31] <necromancer> trose: i do the gmail method: "Print" link pops up the same page with print CSS overrides, and then on dom ready do "window.print()"
[13:21:31] <DannyZB> btw I can write a tutorial about making a facebook-style chat in jQuery
[13:21:38] <DannyZB> would take me a day or two though
[13:21:49] <necromancer> DannyZB: you can't do that with just jQuery
[13:22:02] <DannyZB> jQuery / PHP-mySQL
[13:22:09] <DannyZB> with JSON data
[13:22:10] <necromancer> yeah i guess
[13:22:15] <necromancer> it'll be pretty slow
[13:22:16] <eddiemonge> not even just that
[13:22:21] <necromancer> facebook uses xmpp
[13:22:26] <eddiemonge> you need comet or something like it
[13:22:28] <DannyZB> why would it be slow?
[13:22:32] <DannyZB> it would be find
[13:22:37] <DannyZB> the new facebook chat sucks anyway heh
[13:22:39] <necromancer> eddiemonge: nah you could do it with just PHP/MySQL it would just be really slow
[13:22:43] <Kambfhase> facbook also uses YOUR DATA
[13:22:46] <necromancer> DannyZB: it's at least "instant" messaging
[13:23:00] <eddiemonge> necromancer: it would kill your server with php/mysql
[13:23:05] <necromancer> eddiemonge: oh yeah haha
[13:23:07] <necromancer> probably
[13:23:08] <DannyZB> so what ?
[13:23:19] <DannyZB> you query the server once a second
[13:23:19] <djQuery>  sockets
[13:23:20] <eddiemonge> so killing a server is a good thing?
[13:23:30] <DannyZB> if it returns an empty JSON array there's no new data
[13:23:32] <DannyZB> no biggie
[13:23:34] <Es0teric> kambfhase, still nothing...
[13:23:36] <necromancer> DannyZB: it would be slow because you have to poll for changes. once per second is fucking turtle speed compared to conventional IM programs
[13:23:39] <djQuery> or the new google chrome browser to browser comunication thingy
[13:23:41] <eddiemonge> yeah querying the server once a second times how many users are connected === dead server pretty quickly
[13:23:45] <DannyZB> so what
[13:23:47] <necromancer> DannyZB: why would anyone use a web-based IM service that's SLOWER than their own service
[13:23:48] <Es0teric> all the letters work except for #
[13:24:01] <trose> necromancer, hmm guess i'll have to do that. i'm trying to print something that is just a few lines. not the whole page.
[13:24:07] <DannyZB> nercomancer : if it's for a website the user already uses it's find
[13:24:17] <necromancer> it's not
[13:24:21] <DannyZB> and most browsers can -easily- handle half-second queries
[13:24:24] <necromancer> i mean you can waste your time building it
[13:24:29] <necromancer> i'm just saying it's not useful
[13:24:33] <trose> necromancer, i can always just visibility: hidden on everything that i don't want to print
[13:24:40] <Gho5t> how can i step through what happens when i click the enter key on an input so i can see what is being fired that is updating somethign on my page
[13:24:42] <Gho5t> without putting alerts all over my shit
[13:24:44] <DannyZB> how are you saying facebook did it anyway?
[13:24:45] <necromancer> trose: that's what i do, with print.css and media="print"
[13:24:50] <DannyZB> the user can't be a server
[13:24:52] <necromancer> DannyZB: they use XMPP, which is Jabber
[13:24:54] <DannyZB> he has to poll for changes
[13:25:02] <eddiemonge> Gho5t: i told you, firebug has that built in. use breakpoints
[13:25:03] <trose> necromancer, kk that'll have to do
[13:25:06] <DannyZB> it's still JSON / javascript no?
[13:25:11] <Kambfhase> Es0teric: can you paste an example # url?
[13:25:13] <DannyZB> I don't see the difference
[13:25:13] <necromancer> nah with XMPP and publish/subscribe, the user "subscribes" to an IM server and receives changes instantly
[13:25:25] <DannyZB> it's never instant !
[13:25:29] <necromancer> DannyZB: look up XMPP and publish/subscribe
[13:25:29] <DannyZB> it's polling for sure
[13:25:31] <necromancer> no it's not
[13:25:32] <DannyZB> firewalls block that
[13:25:36] <DannyZB> it's just a layer
[13:25:36] <trose> necromancer, thanks for your help :)
[13:25:39] <Es0teric> kambfhase -> http://localhost/project_amalgam/term-titles/?firstletter=%23
[13:25:45] <Es0teric> thats for #
[13:26:05] <DannyZB> a "server" is any pc that can recieve data without asking for it first
[13:26:16] <eddiemonge> DannyZB: maybe you should read some tutorials on the subject
[13:26:23] <Es0teric> i perfer to use linux for a server, dannyzb
[13:26:26] <DannyZB> maybe I can teach you on the subject (:
[13:26:28] <DannyZB> I wrote servers
[13:26:41] <Es0teric> like debian or susie
[13:26:42] <eddiemonge> you "wrote" servers? interesting
[13:26:44] <Es0teric> or fedors
[13:26:47] <necromancer> DannyZB: stop waving your e-peen for a second and check out http://professionalxmpp.com/
[13:26:48] <Es0teric> *fedora
[13:27:00] <necromancer> that's how they did it
[13:27:05] <eddiemonge> if all you are doing is polling the server every x amount of times, you are going to have serious issues
[13:27:13] <wookiehangover> lol, e-peen
[13:27:13] <DannyZB> nercomancer: as long as it's a javascript library
[13:27:14] <DannyZB> it has to poll for changes
[13:27:46] <eddiemonge> im not sure you are comprehending the backend necessary to make it work correctly and efficiently
[13:28:00] <Kambfhase> Es0teric: ok this is becoming weird
[13:28:01] <wookiehangover> no dude--he's got this shit
[13:28:41] <necromancer> DannyZB: why don't you talk to me when you can define "BOSH".
[13:28:55] <Es0teric> kambfhase, i dont understand why its not working either
[13:28:58] <DannyZB> why don't you get your head out of your ass
[13:29:11] <eddiemonge> DannyZB: careful there...
[13:29:13] <draginx> Will the Khan academy template system be pushed to jquery official?
[13:29:16] <eddiemonge> Es0teric: whats your issue?
[13:29:25] <wookiehangover> where's kboardshorts when I need him
[13:29:28] <DannyZB> oh I am (:
[13:29:42] <littulb> jQuery.makeArray is throwing all of the elements in index 0. Any ideas why??
[13:30:11] <sadmicrowave> littulb, show code?
[13:30:29] <Es0teric> eddiemonge, basically i am using a url code to show what letter the user is on... so if the user is on firstletter=B, a <li> tag will be highlighted corresponding with that letter in the url - right now everything works except for #
[13:30:32] <DannyZB> yea you probably did something wrong give us a link
[13:30:49] <Gho5t> actually could this be a native browser thing? there is one submit button in a form and when i press enter it submits the form in ie 9 but not 8 and 7
[13:31:03] <eddiemonge> Es0teric: what #? is that supposed to be instead of a letteR?
[13:31:30] <eddiemonge> Gho5t: hitting enter in an input field normally submits the form with no js attached
[13:31:32] <Es0teric> eddiemonge, i have A-Z and then # to signify numbers or symbols
[13:32:43] <Kambfhase> Es0teric: last try: http://pastie.org/2286372
[13:32:46] <eddiemonge> Es0teric: thats probably not the best to use since # are significant in urls
[13:32:50] <Es0teric> eddiemonge, so i have urlencode() in php to encode the hash on the url
[13:33:07] <Es0teric> so urlencode turns the hash into "%23"
[13:33:36] <littulb> sadmicrowave, http://jsfiddle.net/littulb/9HGwn/
[13:33:42] <Benvie> there's two kinds of urlencoding
[13:33:43] <Benvie> well
[13:33:50] <Benvie> there's html/xml and url
[13:33:56] <Benvie> and they both kind of work in both places
[13:34:49] <Es0teric> kambfhase, it works
[13:34:50] <Es0teric> thanks man
[13:35:12] <littulb> sadmicrowave, that link but with the jquery library of course
[13:35:21] <Kambfhase> Es0teric: you might want to add the type of the tag ie a, span a, in front of the [class
[13:35:43] <Es0teric> kambfhase, nah that should work fine
[13:36:05] <Kambfhase> but its faster that way
[13:36:38] <Sean-Der> Is there a way to stop any button inside a form from submitting?
[13:36:43] <eddiemonge> ?text
[13:36:44] <bot-t> .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[13:36:45] <Es0teric> kambfhase, ok then so the class is in a li tag
[13:37:14] <eddiemonge> littulb: so whats the problem again?
[13:37:24] <Es0teric> kambfhase, so it should be -> $('li [class~="letter-#"]').css( objCss); ?
[13:37:37] <Kambfhase> Sean-Der: $('form button").submit( false)
[13:37:42] <eddiemonge> Sean-Der: e.preventDefault()
[13:37:48] <littulb> its putting all of the div elements in arr[0], the very first index
[13:37:58] <eddiemonge> littulb: yeah, thats how .text works
[13:38:12] <Kambfhase> Es0teric: if the li hase the letter class remove the space
[13:38:36] <littulb> k....how do i get them spread across 5 indexes .... or have each one in it's own index, rather
[13:38:38] <sadmicrowave> littulb, http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/9HGwn/2/ is this what you want?
[13:38:55] <Es0teric> kambfhase so then $('li[class~="letter-#"]').css( objCss);
[13:39:01] <Kambfhase> yeah
[13:39:04] <sadmicrowave> littulb, no I got it, hold on..I know what you want..
[13:39:10] <Es0teric> alright, will do thanks man
[13:39:38] <Sean-Der> Thank you eddiemonge and Kambfhase
[13:39:40] <eddiemonge> littulb: http://jsfiddle.net/9HGwn/3/
[13:40:15] <mikemo> I have many <a class="expand"> tags on a single page, and would like to write some jquery that would toggle the class of the next element OF THE CLICKED TAG. Is this possible without using id= xxx ?
[13:40:20] <Kambfhase> yeah, use eddiemonge's version mine is like the brute force approach
[13:40:39] <eddiemonge> mikemo: see ? next
[13:40:39] <bot-t> mikemo, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[13:41:39] <littulb> sadmicrowave - yeah, thats it!! So whats the point of $.makeArray????
[13:41:54] <mikemo> bot-t: I've used the next function, but it then toggles all the siblings, not just the one. What kind of filter would tell me which element follows the one that was clicked?
[13:41:55] <bot-t> mikemo, You may rely on it.
[13:41:56] <sadmicrowave> littulb, http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/9HGwn/4/
[13:41:56] <Gho5t> eddiemonge: i suppose that ie 7/8 must have an issue with it then
[13:42:13] <littulb> im using chrome and firefox
[13:42:24] <mikemo> oops, sorry, edddiemonge -- is it possible?
[13:43:24] <sadmicrowave> littulb, I've never used makeArray() but you can do it easily with .push
[13:43:30] <eddiemonge> mikemo: in your click, use .next()
[13:43:45] <jbrokc> how cost perfrmant is changing a css style with javascript? does it cause a repaint for each style/element that you change?
[13:43:48] <jbrokc> performant*
[13:43:50] <eddiemonge> littulb: ive never used make array either.
[13:43:56] <littulb> .push is GREAT.... I was just trying a way where I did not have to use a loop.
[13:44:00] <eddiemonge> jbrokc: yse
[13:44:22] <mikemo> eddiemonge: I do, but it changes all the classes then, not just the one after the tag that fired the event. Is there a way to use a filter for the tag that fired the event?
[13:44:34] <eddiemonge> ?pe mikemo
[13:44:36] <bot-t> eddiemonge, Launched! (finally..) - True Ventures TEC Program - http://www.trueventurestec.com/2011/07/27/launched-finally/
[13:44:41] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ mikemo
[13:44:41] <bot-t> mikemo, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[13:45:01] <littulb> eddiemonge...yeah, they need to just delete that from jquery altogether!! its a freegin tease...just devilish!!
[13:46:00] <eddiemonge> littulb: its not made for that and stuff is very rarely ever deleted
[13:46:04] <eddiemonge> like .size()
[13:46:59] <sadmicrowave> i still use size() **blush**
[13:47:10] <eddiemonge> sadmicrowave: you are kidding right?
[13:47:14] <sadmicrowave> ^^ocassionally
[13:47:38] <littulb> eddiemonge.... it actually does not do what's shown on the website though
[13:47:44] <eddiemonge> sadmicrowave: why??????
[13:47:53] <eddiemonge> littulb: you werent using it correctly
[13:48:06] <sadmicrowave> let me rephrase - I still have .size() used....meaning I have it used in my old files I never went back and changed
[13:48:30] <littulb> eddiemonge.... oh ok.. thats what i was asking. Could u show me the way to use it?
[13:48:36] <eddiemonge> oh ok. you should just do a find and replace
[13:48:46] <Sean-Der> To take all my jquery out of my actual pages can I just copy the jQuery to an external js and then use a <script type= src=>
[13:48:48] <sadmicrowave> eddiemonge, that would work...provided I have the time...:/
[13:48:58] <Sean-Der> Is there anything else I need to do or is there a link on jQuerys website
[13:49:47] <eddiemonge> littulb: look at the demos. youre example was sending it a string. if you didnt have the .text() makeArray would have worked correctly
[13:49:49] <sadmicrowave> Sean-Der, yes
[13:50:07] <eddiemonge> Sean-Der: thats it. dontforget to still include the jquery library
[13:51:05] <eddiemonge> i have time for one last question. who wants to ask something?
[13:51:08] <littulb> eddiemonge... i tried it that way as well. It did not work. I also tried sending it the .html which worked better but still not what was shown on the site
[13:51:14] <sadmicrowave> bot-t - NoooOoooOoooOoo
[13:51:28] <rod> Hi I'm having trouble working with DIVs with special chatacters in them
[13:51:33] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/YXQ0hewF
[13:51:38] <Sean-Der> Any idea what I am doing wrong here?
[13:51:45] <eddiemonge> littulb: again, those return strings, not arrays or array like objects
[13:51:56] <Sean-Der> My code works if I have it in my .php, but when I refrence an external js no luck
[13:52:07] <Gho5t> Hey if i want to close my autocomplete menu, shouldn't this work $('#myInput').trigger('close');
[13:52:07] <eddiemonge> ?ready @ Sean-Der
[13:52:07] <bot-t> Sean-Der, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[13:52:09] <rod> $("#test").html("change data.");     works   , but 			$("#test.com").html("change data ."); FAILS
[13:52:29] <eddiemonge> Gho5t: no. you have to use the autocomplete close method
[13:52:44] <sadmicrowave> Sean-Der, does your fns.js have $(document).ready(function(){ ....  at the top?
[13:52:45] <Gho5t> how do i fire that?
[13:52:47] <Es0teric> damn... i have a big problem now... -> http://pastie.org/private/o6lznho3bihfzx23caocnq the objcss code is conflicting with the inUrl code... =_=
[13:52:51] <eddiemonge> rod: whats the difference?
[13:52:53] <Gho5t> that is my autocomplete's id
[13:53:00] <eddiemonge> Gho5t: look at the docs
[13:53:03] <Sean-Der> sadmicrowave: No it does not is that my issue?
[13:53:05] <rod> the DIV ID has a period in it
[13:53:07] <littulb> eddiemonge... ok, I think Im understanding.
[13:53:24] <Jayflux> Sean-Der try it with the document ready
[13:53:25] <Gho5t> i did it's confusing. .autocomplete( "close" )
[13:53:34] <sadmicrowave> rod, the jquery selector is thinking you are referring to a class by using the '.'
[13:53:36] <Gho5t> do i need to chain that to my id
[13:53:40] <rod> ohhh
[13:53:44] <Sean-Der> the contents of function(){ "entire script}
[13:53:49] <Gho5t> $('#myInput').autocomplete( "close" ) ?
[13:53:55] <eddiemonge> littulb: http://jsfiddle.net/9HGwn/5/
[13:54:06] <Sean-Der> so the function ready has the entire script inside of it?
[13:54:08] <eddiemonge> Gho5t: yes
[13:54:10] <rod> i get the same error when I try to use a colon
[13:54:22] <rod> Can I escape the character
[13:54:23] <Jayflux> Sean-Der http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Introducing_$(document).ready()
[13:54:24] <sadmicrowave> Sean-Der, change from function(){ "entire script" } to $(document).ready(function(){ "entire script" });
[13:54:55] <eddiemonge> rod, periods arent really valid in ids
[13:55:02] <Sean-Der> MAGIC IT WORKS!!
[13:55:05] <sadmicrowave> rod, the colon is specifying a pseudo-class in jquery
[13:55:12] <eddiemonge> rod use a dash or underscore
[13:55:12] <Gho5t> cool thanks
[13:55:15] <duttons> hi all could someone help me work out the best way to get an image zoom ( cloud-zoom ) to work on an image wrapper ?
[13:55:18] <rod> hmm alrighty I suppose
[13:55:28] <rod> I gues i'll change all my dots to dashes and colons to underscores
[13:55:36] <rod> thanks eddiemonge and sadmicrowave
[13:55:41] <sadmicrowave> yep
[13:56:34] <Es0teric> kambfhase, are you there?
[13:56:34] <duttons> I have a url etc.. just need some advice on how to tackle the problem
[13:57:05] <sadmicrowave> duttons, post the code
[13:57:07] <Kambfhase> No, my Kambfhase has gone to sleep. this is his dog speaking
[13:57:30] <sadmicrowave> hello Kambfhase's dog! whats your name?
[13:57:44] <Kambfhase> Kambfhund
[13:57:52] <sadmicrowave> lol
[13:57:59] <duttons> <sadmicrowave>: source is at http//chicfreakz.co.uk/flowergirls.html
[13:58:20] <sadmicrowave> duttons, umm, no its not
[13:58:21] <duttons> sorry http://www.chicfreakz.co.uk/flowergirls.html
[13:58:38] <cats4gold> Any reason why $.get would run the .error callback in ie9 ie8, but no other browser(chrome, FF3, FF4, Opera)?  The get retrieves html that is going to be appended
[13:58:43] <Es0teric> ha ha ha, very funny... but seriously - kambfhase these two codes are conflicting with eachother -> http://pastie.org/private/o6lznho3bihfzx23caocnq
[13:59:07] <Yoplitein> back, with a new problem
[13:59:28] <Kambfhase> wow, i bet that sucks, eh?
[13:59:56] <sadmicrowave> duttons, so your looking for a way to zoom?
[14:00:13] <Es0teric> kambfhase, idk how to fix the problem..
[14:00:30] <Snugug> How can I convert an array into a JSON object?
[14:00:31] <Kambfhase> move the lower part over the upper part
[14:00:35] <Yoplitein> $.get("page", {args}).always(function(response){}) etc.
[14:00:42] <duttons>  <sadmicrowave>:  I have a set of thumbs ( thumbsContainer) and a set of images  srcBig : which load into the imageWapper / displayed.. I am trying to implement cloudzoom on the main image displayed.
[14:00:43] <Kambfhase> JSON.stringify youarray)
[14:00:51] <Kambfhase> JSON.stringify( yourarray)
[14:00:57] <Yoplitein> my server is returning a 204, and now the response object is empty
[14:01:02] <Snugug> Kambfhase: Thanks, let me try
[14:01:02] <sadmicrowave> ?.stringify
[14:01:03] <bot-t> sadmicrowave, jQuery.parseJSON - Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[14:01:41] <Es0teric> wow.... i cant believe that actually mattered...
[14:01:43] <Kambfhase> oh yeah, pull in an JSON shim for browsers who dont support it ;)
[14:01:45] <Es0teric> moving it to the upper part
[14:01:47] <sadmicrowave> Kambfhase, stringify....really?
[14:02:03] <Yoplitein> I'm guessing this is a feature. Is there any way to make jQuery NOT do that?
[14:02:12] <duttons>  <sadmicrowave>:  cloudzoom needs to see a href so I would need to on hover of the image wrapper get it to add a href to the image src and also add the class cloud-zoom
[14:02:47] <sadmicrowave> so you need to .addClass('cloud-zoom') on .hove()?
[14:02:51] <duttons>  <sadmicrowave>: I am just unclear how I would do this ... :S
[14:02:59] <Kambfhase> Es0teric: the thing is, when the url contains no firstletter the regexxp fails and the code blows up, preventing the lower art from bein executed
[14:03:00] <sadmicrowave> .hover()**
[14:04:23] <duttons>  <sadmicrowave>: the script is at http://www.professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom.htm
[14:04:42] <Es0teric> ahhh kambfhase... i see
[14:04:51] <Es0teric> that makes sense lol
[14:04:56] <sadmicrowave> duttons, do you have a large version of the same image?
[14:05:00] <Kambfhase> you see what?
[14:05:06] <Kambfhase> less drugs, mate!
[14:05:29] <magnus_> if i want to reload an image and meanwhile, display a loading spinner icon in its place, how would I do it with jQuery?
[14:05:42] <sadmicrowave> Kambfhund, your very astute for a dog
[14:05:55] <Yoplitein> anyone?
[14:06:00] <duttons>  <sadmicrowave>: I could do..  but they are pretty big anyway,  the gallery scipt I am using resizes them for the imagewrapper
[14:06:07] <magnus_> i tried something like: $("#myimg").attr('src', 'spinner.gif'); $("#myimg").attr('src', 'replacement.png');  .. but that obviously didnt work
[14:06:18] <Kambfhase> sadmicrowave: yeah, yyou can call me god, if you wish.
[14:07:06] <sadmicrowave> duttons, no, I'm saying cloud-zoom doesn't work unless you have 2 image sizes. a small one for preview and a large one (preferably High-Def to avoid pixelation) for zooming
[14:07:39] <duttons>  <sadmicrowave>: yes I can sort out some larger images
[14:07:53] <Kambfhase> Anyways, i am off.
[14:08:09] <sadmicrowave> duttons, when you get the larger ones, the href needs to point to the large image
[14:08:40] <duttons>  <sadmicrowave>: ok  so have you used this plugin before?
[14:08:47] <itsgreen> someone familiar with: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Autocomplete#Dependencies_between_fields
[14:09:12] <duttons>  <sadmicrowave>: do you see what I am trying to do.. and is there a way to do it?
[14:09:15] <sadmicrowave> duttons, I went searching for a plugin to do exactly what you are trying to do...and since I only had 1 small sized image (and no way of getting a larger one) I had to create my own plugin
[14:09:36] <itsgreen> I want to base the value based on input id of the autocomplete...
[14:10:27] <karega> does anyone know howto pull the contents of a script file?
[14:10:35] <Sean-Der> in jQuery is it possible to have " and ' inside of functions or am I going to have to find some work around
[14:10:39] <karega> using the DOM?
[14:10:39] <Sean-Der> example: http://pastebin.com/siW7Y1Kv
[14:10:44] <duttons>  <sadmicrowave>: I really fancy using the inner zoom function on cloud-zoom for my image wrapper
[14:10:57] <sadmicrowave> duttons, I did too
[14:11:08] <sadmicrowave> ^^ stress 'did'
[14:11:37] <vacho> http://screencast.com/t/WQ4toy6b4K3T
[14:11:43] <vacho> how do I debug that?
[14:11:48] <duttons>  <sadmicrowave>: I found a site last night that does this sort of thing but couldnt follow the coding.. as I am not too hot with jquey but eager to learn
[14:11:50] <kborchers> Sean-Der: yes you can do that but you can't use multiple lines like that
[14:11:53] <vacho> I have jquery UI loaded
[14:12:01] <Sean-Der> Whitespace matters?
[14:12:04] <kborchers> yes
[14:12:10] <vacho> ajpiano: bro
[14:12:55] <duttons>  <sadmicrowave>: which was here.. http://www.soulmyst.com/
[14:14:27] <duttons>  <sadmicrowave>: was it pretty easy to sort out once looked into it?
[14:15:28] <sadmicrowave> duttons, well let me know if you find a good zoomer that works without a larger image
[14:15:41] <sadmicrowave> duttons, because I'm still in the market
[14:16:09] <vacho> anyone? please.
[14:16:35] <sadmicrowave> im out
[14:17:08] <danieliser> i am working on a ui that uses a lot of modals and some have forms other display data etc.. all loaded from php files.. most have custom functions that need to be called after the modal loads.. any way to call these dynamically and load them from the php? so that my main js file size isnt massive with many different modal calls..
[14:17:15] <nerdshark|work> vacho: .offset() is a method
[14:17:22] <duttons>  <sadmicrowave>: possibly this one? http://www.ajax-zoom.com/
[14:18:06] <ajpiano> which version of jquery ui do you lhave loaded, vacho
[14:18:13] <duttons>  <sadmicrowave>: I have a larger image.. what would I need to do to my script to get it working in the image wrapper?
[14:19:40] <vacho> ajpiano: latest
[14:19:50] <duttons> hi all could someone help me work out the best way to get an image zoom ( cloud-zoom ) to work on an image wrapper ?
[14:20:02] <SuperID> newbie jquery question... I've used $("#element").text("some text") plenty of times and it works fine.   But what if I want to update $("#element") with the contents of some other .js file?
[14:20:05] <ajpiano> vacho: what happens when you do console.dir( $.ui.autocomplete );
[14:20:29] <vacho> >>> console.dir( $.ui.autocomplete );
[14:20:30] <vacho> TypeError: $.ui is undefined
[14:20:59] <danieliser> is it better to add the scripts at the end of the loaded content inside <script tags or in the onload function of my modal script?
[14:21:41] <ajpiano> vacho: you *clearly* do not have jQuery UI loaded
[14:22:04] <vacho> ajpiano: it's in my source
[14:22:16] <ajpiano> is it 404'ing ?
[14:22:56] <duttons> hi all could someone help me work out the best way to get an image zoom ( cloud-zoom ) to work on an image wrapper ?
[14:23:01] <vacho> ajpiano: http://screencast.com/t/MCCt1ric
[14:23:20] <ajpiano> vacho: are you loading jQuery again AFTER you load jQuery UI
[14:23:36] <ajpiano> like, does some other library you're including have a copy of jquery inside or something
[14:25:09] <vacho> ajpiano: thanks for looking into it.. I don't think so.. but shouldn't it still be OK to load it twice?
[14:25:21] <ajpiano> no
[14:25:42] <ajpiano> vacho: let's say i had you a fancy leather bag
[14:25:53] <ajpiano> and then you put a precious trinket inside of the bag
[14:26:03] <ajpiano> then i take the bag away from you, and hand you an identical leather bag
[14:26:20] <ajpiano> the precious trinket is not magically in the second bag, even though the bags are identical
[14:27:06] <ajpiano> in otherwords, if you include jQuery, then jQuery UI, and then include jQuery again, you're destroying the bag with the trinket in it
[14:27:17] <Yoplitein> okay, $.get.always(function(response) {}): a few minutes ago, response was an object that had fields for the response code, the output of the get, etc. and now it's a string. WTF?
[14:28:32] <ajpiano> Yoplitein: if i were you, i would just use $.ajax({type: "GET", complete: function(xhr, textStatus) { } });
[14:28:36] <ajpiano> complete is the same as always
[14:28:40] <ajpiano> and will always get the right arguments
[14:28:50] <ajpiano> and then you don't have to futz with the latebinding deferred style thing
[14:29:09] <vacho> ajpiano: got it thanks!
[14:29:15] <kborchers> ajpiano: again with the stellar analogies ... where can i get my own leather bag with a precious trinket inside???
[14:29:51] <ajpiano> maybe it'll be swag for jqcon :p
[14:30:19] <kborchers> i'll be looking for it when i get there
[14:35:29] <Yoplitein> ajpiano: oh, deferreds. That explains it. Thanks.
[14:35:50] <ajpiano> :)

[15:15:38] <danieliser> is there a way to use an already available class inside an ajax loaded php script? for example i initiate a db class in the index.php and click a link to ajax a php into a modal any way around having to include the db class php file and call a new instance?
[15:18:53] <duttons> anyone got a minute to help a poor helpless newbie with a question?
[15:24:55] <Jayflux> duttons just ask
[15:25:59] <duttons> i have done but no replies..    I am trying to get cloud-zoom working on my site but having a problem finding the right jquery commands to get the plugin to work
[15:26:21] <duttons> <Jayflux>i have done but no replies..    I am trying to get cloud-zoom working on my site but having a problem finding the right jquery commands to get the plugin to work
[15:26:35] <duttons> <Jayflux>:i have done but no replies..    I am trying to get cloud-zoom working on my site but having a problem finding the right jquery commands to get the plugin to work
[15:27:10] <Jayflux> duttons you don't need to reply 3 times :)
[15:27:23] <eddiemonge> danieliser: i think thats a php question
[15:27:43] <eddiemonge> wtf is cloud-zoom?
[15:27:46] <danieliser> eddiemonge: cant find a channel
[15:27:55] <duttons> <Jayflux>:sorry about that I cursored up
[15:28:04] <eddiemonge> danieliser: you mean other than ##php?
[15:28:20] <duttons> eddiemonge an image zoomer that does inner zooms etc..
[15:28:45] <danieliser> eddiemonge: invite only it said
[15:29:37] <duttons> <eddiemonge>: i am trying to get the plugin to work on whichever image is loaded into the image wrapper at the time..
[15:30:03] <eddiemonge> danieliser: its not
[15:30:09] <eddiemonge> danieliser: /j ##php
[15:30:16] <duttons> <eddiemonge>: but stuggling to find the right approach to it..
[15:30:38] <eddiemonge> duttons: i still have no idea what you mean. how about see ? pe
[15:30:39] <bot-t> duttons, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[15:40:36] <duttons> <bot-t>Thanks will copy into jsfiddle thanks
[15:44:32] <mtro> I am trying to append a title below an image. Could someone help me debug this code? http://drupalbin.com/19337
[15:47:44] <duttons> <bot-t>not sure if I have this right but I think you will get the basis ... http://jsfiddle.net/2fuc6/10/
[15:49:24] <eddiemonge> mtro: http://drupalbin.com/19338
[15:49:29] <eddiemonge> duttons: bot-t is a bot
[15:50:54] <eddiemonge> duttons: are you even including jquery?
[15:53:13] <duttons> <eddiemonge>: yes I am using a jquery gallery and then cloud-zoom but trying to link the two..
[15:53:24] <eddiemonge> i didnt see it in your html
[15:54:20] <duttons> <eddiemonge>: sorry, probably just didnt paste things in properly..
[15:54:35] <eddiemonge> do you have a live link?
[15:55:46] <duttons> <eddiemonge>: yes   http://www.chicfreakz.co.uk/flowergirls.html
[15:56:27] <eddiemonge> so whats supposed to happen?
[15:56:46] <Ogredude> yay, I got autocomplete to work!  I don't understand why it works, but it works.
[15:57:14] <xonecas> o/
[15:58:17] <duttons> <eddiemonge>: the image wrapper in the middle changes when you click the thumbnails.  I need it to add a class on hover or mouseenter on the imageWrapper and then need to get it to look at a larger image which it then zooms on the imagewrapper
[15:58:56] <eddiemonge> do you have code that is trying to do that now?
[15:59:32] <Ogredude> https://gist.github.com/1112770
[15:59:46] <xonecas> http://jsfiddle.net/dydkJ/ --> can anyone help me understand why this works on chrome but not firefox (both the latest versions)
[16:00:21] <cremaster> when i call jQuery.isFunction(myFunction) I get error: "myFunction is not defined", why might that be?
[16:00:32] <eddiemonge> xonecas: do you know whats its doing? vs what you want it to do?
[16:00:53] <eddiemonge> cremaster: did you define it? see ? isfunction
[16:00:53] <bot-t> cremaster, jQuery.isFunction(): Determine if the argument passed is a Javascript function object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isFunction/
[16:01:03] <duttons> <eddiemonge>: just worked out that its possibly (displayed) that needs the class adding to it as the imagewrapper spans the whole page.
[16:01:31] <eddiemonge> duttons: look at hover and toggleClass
[16:01:46] <xonecas> eddiemonge: ultimatly I want to call the right function depending on what key was pressed, right now I just don't get why it doesn't work on firefox. It's such a simple thing
[16:02:32] <eddiemonge> xonecas: try this http://jsfiddle.net/dydkJ/1/ and see whats in the console
[16:03:19] <xonecas> eddiemonge: I've tryed that, but the event handler doesn't get called in firefox
[16:03:26] <xonecas> so the console.log(ev) won't run
[16:03:57] <eddiemonge> xonecas: then theres a problem with the rest of your page
[16:04:00] <cremaster> eddiemonge, I want to know if it's defined so I can handle it gracefully, if I didn't define the function then $.isFunction() should return false, not flag a browser error
[16:04:20] <xonecas> erm, i'm reproducing it in fiddle
[16:04:30] <xonecas> how's my page have anything to do with it
[16:06:11] <abjorn> oi
[16:06:12] <abjorn> sup
[16:08:39] <xonecas> eddiemonge: did you even tryed to run it in firefox?
[16:10:26] <eddiemonge> xonecas: yeah im trying it now.
[16:10:50] <xonecas> eddiemonge: thanks, you should see the key codes in chrome, but no response in firefox
[16:11:53] <eddiemonge> xonecas: $(document).keypress works. this looks like a bug you should file
[16:12:31] <xonecas> eddiemonge: yeah I solved the problem  with document too, I was just making sure this wasn't just me doin' it wrong
[16:12:48] <xonecas> eddiemonge: thank you for your time, I'll submit a report
[16:14:03] <xonecas> eddiemonge: what OS are you on?
[16:14:18] <eddiemonge> Mac. tried in 4.0 and 3.6
[16:14:27] <xonecas> Thank you!
[16:17:18] <atrigent> hey guys, what's the right way to have a required option to a widget? do I just return with some kind of error from the _create function?
[16:17:26] <atrigent> in jquery-ui, that is
[16:18:27] <devinrolsen> we need to extend Chrome's dev tools to audit style sheets against the entire site vs. a per page scenario.
[16:19:15] <ohcibi> i have an <a> in a <summary> when the <a> is clicked, i want the summarys click event not to be fired.. i used e.stopPropagation on the a's click event, however the summary click event gets fired anyway, whats wrong?
[16:19:16] <ajpiano> atrigent, if it's "required" there should be a safe default provided in the widget
[16:19:44] <ajpiano> atrigent, i would be intrigued to hear of a case where you couldn't safely default and throwing an exception would be necessary
[16:20:21] <atrigent> I'm writing a drag-and-drop thing (yes, I know jquery-ui already has stuff for that)
[16:20:28] <eddiemonge> ohcibi: how did you do it? are you passing e in the click function?
[16:20:35] <atrigent> where stuff will be dropped into an iframe
[16:20:48] <atrigent> and the required option would be the name of the iframe
[16:20:54] <atrigent> some selector which refers to the iframe
[16:21:08] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: yes sure
[16:21:15] <atrigent> I suppose the default could be 'iframe'...
[16:21:32] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: i just called e.stopPropagation() right after the functions head
[16:21:34] <ajpiano> atrigent, worth considering that just cause they provided a name doesn't mean that iframe is actually there
[16:22:07] <ajpiano> i would probably default it to iframe, and then if you want to throw an exception, throw it if you can't actually *access* the iframe
[16:22:18] <atrigent> uh well yeah, but if they didn't provide it it means a lot less
[16:22:59] <eddiemonge> ohcibi: code?
[16:25:12] <madprops> im hiding the cursor like this * {cursor: none;}  is it possible to show it temporarily if the mouse is moved?
[16:25:42] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/448477/ the function is toggleTrack
[16:26:07] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: dont mind the <%= .... %> its erb
[16:26:19] <uptownben> Hey all.
[16:27:50] <Ogredude> hey I've got some generated elements that have really long IDs, but the first umpty characters of each is the same.  Is there any way I can store the stuff that stays the same somewhere and use it in $() selectors later, along with the stuff that changes?  I've got IDs like user_department_attributes_company_attributes_name, user_department_attributes_company_attributes_address, user_department_attributes_company_attributes_city
[16:27:50] <uptownben> I added some divs and ul/li element dynamically, how do I activate JQuery UI tabs() on the newly created <div>? I used: tab_div = $('<div/>',{}); to create the main div
[16:27:57] <eddiemonge> ohcibi: no idea. can you do it on jsfiddle?
[16:28:15] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: hm it seems that the click event gets not fired, but the details box is opened anyway... looks more like a browser-support problem to me now
[16:28:15] <eddiemonge> Ogredude: why not use classes?
[16:28:45] <eddiemonge> uptownben: then call the UI functions on that tab_div
[16:29:22] <ajpiano> Ogredude fwiw, var prefix = "whatever_that_is_really_long_";  $("#"+prefix+"whatever");
[16:29:47] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  works for me.  Thanks.
[16:29:52] <Ogredude> eddiemonge:  what do you mean?
[16:30:10] <eddiemonge> Ogredude: i mean add classes to those elements. thats what they are for
[16:30:30] <uptownben> eddiemonge: I tried $(tab_div).tabs();..  in the code right after I finish setting up the the main div, UL, and sub divs, but it doesnt do anything.. is that the right way to call it ?
[16:30:58] <eddiemonge> uptownben: tab_div.tabs()
[16:31:01] <Ogredude> eddiemonge:  but I need to address them by ID so I can fill them with the info returned by the autocomplete.
[16:31:21] <eddiemonge> Ogredude: you can still use classes for that
[16:31:45] <Ogredude> You're talking CSS classes on the elements, yeah?
[16:31:55] <Ogredude> Not sure how I see that as useful
[16:32:23] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  that trick worked great.  easier to type '+pre+' than that whole dang thing
[16:32:53] <eddiemonge> Ogredude: yes, "css" classes
[16:33:06] <eddiemonge> im assuming you are trying to target multiple elements at once?
[16:33:55] <ajpiano> Ogredude: are you using a lot of autocompletes, requesting different data, but using all the same config options and stuff
[16:34:06] <ajpiano> all over your application
[16:34:16] <uptownben> eddiemonge: yeah, that worked, I mean, I see the additional classes added to the elements, but no tabs styling, I assume I need to include some CSS?
[16:34:30] <eddiemonge> uptownben: yes, you need the jqueryui css and js
[16:34:45] <uptownben> ok.
[16:35:32] <djQuery> uptownben: its the css that does the major work.
[16:36:44] <Zackington> everyone join #riverview
[16:37:07] <duttons> <eddiemonge>: ok ta.. so done that and Iits addding the class on hover but now I need it to do something similar to this : i have found this as part of another site. This is pretty much what I am trying to achieve.  http://www.soulmyst.com/
[16:37:33] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld wassup btw
[16:37:38] <Ogredude> eddiemonge:  well, I need to target the address element with the address data, the city element with the city data, the state element...  so I don't really see where using css classes is helpful in this case.
[16:37:39] <ajpiano> saw you pinged like forever ago
[16:37:55] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  nope, I've got two, and they refer to completely different models.
[16:38:41] <ajpiano> right, different models, but like, that doesn't affect like, where in the dom it gets positioned relative to the element on which it was instantiated, or what happens when you click a choice or hover a choice
[16:39:32] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/yxtLy/1/ so there should be no alert('bla') and now details box opened when clicking the black box right (open in chrome)
[16:39:52] <Ogredude> nope.
[16:40:08] <ajpiano> what eddiemonge is sort of getitng at is that you could use classes so that you would just have things like class="autocomplete cities" or class="autocomplete doctors" and then generalize the shared code, and just have the lookup determined by it seeing which class it was instantiated
[16:40:17] <Ogredude> oh, that
[16:40:19] <Ogredude> yeah, I'm already doing that
[16:40:22] <ajpiano> yeah
[16:40:29] <Ogredude> this is for the return values in the select action
[16:40:48] <Ogredude> not sure how else to handle filling in the values from the incoming JSON to the text fields besides addressing each text field by ID and setting its val
[16:40:52] <ajpiano> you shoudn't have to requery the dom inside of a callback on a ui element
[16:41:07] <Zackington> heyi have problems with jquery with the newest internet explorer
[16:41:58] <ajpiano> Ogredude: if you use a consistent naming convention you should at least be able to iterate do do that
[16:42:10] <Ogredude> well I'm not seeing a hell of a lot of documentation or examples to show how it should properly be done.  The demo on the jquery site is very very brief and doesn't go into detail on what to do if you need your autocomplete to actually fill out a bunch of form fields when a value is selected.
[16:42:21] <eddiemonge> ohcibi: kind of seems excessively complicated for what you are trying to do. can you simplify it?
[16:42:37] <ajpiano> i thought you were requerying the dom to get the input element itself, what you're doing is perfectly reasonable Ogredude :)
[16:42:47] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  well it's Rails in the backend, the naming scheme is very straightforward
[16:43:02] <Ogredude> it's just that I'm 2 models deep in nested attributes, which ends up generating some despicably long element IDs
[16:43:20] <eddiemonge> Ogredude: autocomplete is generally only for one field, to autocomplete what is being typed into that box
[16:43:34] <Ogredude> eddiemonge:  I understand that.  I need it for more than that.
[16:43:50] <ajpiano> ok well if you get back like some structure like {foo: "bar", baz: "bat"}
[16:43:53] <Ogredude> I need it to fill out the whole damn form.
[16:43:56] <chovy> anyone know why this doesn't strip all non-digits?
[16:43:59] <chovy> $phoneNum = preg_replace("/\D/g", "", $phoneNum)
[16:44:06] <chovy> woops wrong chan.
[16:44:53] <ajpiano> then you should be able to do like $.each(thatObject, function(key, value) { $("#"+prefix+key).val(value) } );
[16:45:21] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  here's what I have, I should be able to abstract this and make it useful for the department fields too easily enough. https://gist.github.com/1112770
[16:45:56] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  ok, that cleans it up a lot
[16:45:58] <ajpiano> the part in the select event is exactly what i'm saying you could replace with the loop i just showed
[16:46:00] <ajpiano> yeah
[16:46:07] <ajpiano> Ogredude: the reason classes could, however, be useful there
[16:46:08] <Ogredude> I can iterate over ui.item.company
[16:46:22] <ajpiano> is because instead of doing this long id string based search with all this ugly prefix and concatting stuff
[16:48:16] <ajpiano> you could have a set of all the inputs in the form to start , and then use IT in the callback... $someCachedSetOfInputs.each(function() {  $(this).val( ui.item.company[$(this).attr("class")] ); });
[16:48:34] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: i have tracks that can be followed (which means move the map as the tracked objects are moving) or just displayed, i want to toggle the tracking with that span on the right, but i dont want to toggle the visibility when clicking that span... i know moved the span outside the summary http://jsfiddle.net/yxtLy/3/ coming closer
[16:48:50] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: s/know/now/
[16:50:16] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  ok
[16:52:35] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  maybe later.  I think right now I'm going to make sure the tests are all still green, commit my code, and go home.
[16:52:53] <Ogredude> thanks for the help, though.  I got it working just fine by iterating with $.each(ui.item.company
[16:53:04] <ajpiano> cool, just want you to understand both approached :)
[16:53:33] <matterdesign> Hi guys, I am working on a project and like to create event depending on where the user is on the page using his scrollbar, like this website : benthebodyguard.com do you have any direction of plugins to use or jquery function> cheers
[16:55:55] <eddiemonge> ohcibi: you arent targeting the a tags. you are targeting the spans. thats why clicking the a tags takes you somewhere else
[16:56:43] <eddiemonge> ?scrolltop @ matterdesign
[16:56:44] <bot-t> matterdesign, .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[16:56:56] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: the a tags work fine 8-)) it is actually about the spans
[16:58:01] <eddiemonge> the a tags doing what they normally do, follow links, which means the page goes with them
[16:58:35] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: and thats fine.. i want to manipulate the click event of the span
[17:01:49] <eddiemonge> ok im confused to what you want then
[17:02:17] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: why are you confused? 8-)) i was never talking about any links... but i cut it more down:http://jsfiddle.net/yxtLy/5/
[17:02:54] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: the span that gets inserted, when i click it, i dont want the details box to open
[17:03:49] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: as you can see the click event of the summary is not fired (no alert('bla') when clicking the span), but the details box is opened anyway
[17:04:32] <eddiemonge> you need a return false
[17:04:50] <eddiemonge> sorry meant e.preventDefault();
[17:04:54] <eddiemonge> not return false.
[17:05:11] <eddiemonge> the stopprop is working because the alert isnt fired
[17:08:12] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: do i need both then or is stopprop just not the right thing here?
[17:08:49] <eddiemonge> ?tias
[17:08:49] <bot-t> Try It And See
[17:09:55] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: 8-))... thx... going to sleep now 8-)
[17:10:48] <eddiemonge> ajpiano: whats the difference between $('body') and $(document)? playing a bit of devil's advocate here
[17:11:41] <ajpiano> one is the body and one is the document
[17:11:42] <ajpiano> :)
[17:12:46] <eddiemonge> is $('body') a valid selector?
[17:12:58] <xonecas> eddiemonge: yes?
[17:13:14] <xonecas> as in the <body> element
[17:17:13] <eddiemonge> yup body doesnt like keypress in firefox
[17:19:21] <xonecas> eddiemonge: I filed a bug report, I found a closed one that also referenced the problem, but never got solved.
[17:23:32] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/dydkJ/4/show/
[17:25:04] <eddiemonge> no key events
[17:25:09] <eddiemonge> but clicks works

[17:37:03] <cakehero> Anyone have any idea about this JS error: https://www.expertinsight.com/ I'm not really sure how to do a backtrace
[17:38:32] <eddiemonge> what error? or is this just spam?

[17:39:55] <cakehero> Chrome
[17:40:04] <cakehero> let me check FF
[17:40:15] <cakehero> maybe that's why I haven't seen this before
[17:40:20] <cakehero> I upgraded to Lion today.......
[17:40:47] <cakehero> could be related to that, another friend in Chrome gets no error
[17:40:51] <cakehero> and I haven't seen it before

[17:41:13] <cakehero> ok thanks
[17:43:33] <madprops> im hiding the cursor like this * {cursor: none;}  is it possible to show it temporarily if the mouse is moved?
[17:44:49] <eddiemonge> madprops: hiding the cursor? why?
[17:45:20] <madprops> eddiemonge, it's rarely needed
[17:45:47] <eddiemonge> just seems like a bad UX
[17:46:47] <eddiemonge> some browsers/OS hide the mouse when you are typing automatically
[17:47:01] <eddiemonge> i dont think you should be hiding it on purpose.
[17:47:46] <madprops> eddiemonge, pretty much everything can be done with the keyboard
[17:47:51] <madprops> but yeah i think ill just leave it
[18:12:23] <ale> Hello, I have a question about socket.io..no matter what I write on the server.js, when I make node server.js and open the html, the result is a message saying "Welcome to socket.io." How can I change that message??
[18:18:10] <pie_> how would i do grep '^[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}$' on something in jquery?
[18:21:54] <pie_> rather, is it possible to get text from a larger set of text with a regular expression similar to the behaviour of grep?
[18:22:29] <chewed-on> Is anybody experience here with drop down menu ?
[18:23:10] <eddiemonge> ale: not a jquery problem really, try stackoverflow
[18:23:29] <eddiemonge> ?ask @ chewed-on
[18:23:29] <bot-t> chewed-on, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[18:23:30] <chewed-on> I got a drop down menu that I am using the hover() method with. The problem is only the last drop down menu in my navigation menu is reacting to the drop down menu. It's likely a problem with a logic in my loop.: http://pastebin.com/5mFsniLR
[18:24:56] <chewed-on> What I don't get is. The loop understands hide(). It hides all my drop down menus however it doesn't understand that I want hover() to remember which drop down list it belonged to.
[18:25:55] <eddiemonge> chewed-on: two pieces of advice, chain and cache
[18:26:05] <chewed-on> woops, forgot to comment out one line
[18:26:36] <chewed-on> ?
[18:26:41] <chewed-on> What's chain and cache ?

[18:29:32] <KingDosser> Is there a callback function for when .html finishes ?
[18:29:50] <chewed-on> onLoad ?
[18:29:56] <chewed-on> oh sorry
[18:30:06] <chewed-on> KingDosser: nevermind me :P
[18:30:14] <KingDosser> :)
[18:30:44] <eddiemonge> chewed-on: put your html in http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/73Qmv/
[18:31:01] <eddiemonge> KingDosser: no, it should be instant so if you chain after it should be done
[18:31:08] <chewed-on> eddiemonge: my html reads an xml file using jquery you won't see anything if I Just put the html
[18:31:38] <KingDosser> eddiemonge: If i have custom functions called with $.random_fn can i chain those too?
[18:31:48] <rubyruy> any idea why certain jquery.ui animations like bounce and slide steal focus from any inputs contained at the end of their animation?
[18:31:59] <rubyruy> i can just work around it by re-focusing onComplete but... why is this happening?
[18:33:07] <eddiemonge> chewed-on: so you are are creating the markup from an ajax call?
[18:33:18] <chewed-on> yesâ¦I gues you could say that.
[18:33:18] <eddiemonge> KingDosser: if they are chainable
[18:33:36] <chewed-on> I have a callback function for the $.ajax({ â¦ complete: displayMenu });
[18:35:18] <eddiemonge> what is titleList and realLinkIndex?
[18:35:31] <eddiemonge> and titleGroupCount
[18:38:39] <chewed-on> eddiemonge: my full jQuery script: http://pastebin.com/74YZtB1E
[18:39:43] <chewed-on> titleList is an array that stores all the <title></title> in my XML.
[18:40:19] <eddiemonge> why are you calling displayMenu on complete and not in the success?
[18:40:48] <chewed-on> I'm parsing the xml when it successfully retrieved the XML resource
[18:41:09] <chewed-on> then after it's finished parsing the xml (this is when all the data are stored inside the arrays), I tell it to display the menu onto my HTML page
[18:41:40] <chewed-on> I'll upload xml file
[18:42:17] <eddiemonge> chewed-on: if the ajax fails, it will still call displayMenu. is that what you want?
[18:42:57] <chewed-on> I need the ajax to be able to find my xml document. This is where I defined what links I have in my navigation menu
[18:43:13] <chewed-on> if it fails to find my navigation.xml document then I can't display it on the page

[18:48:20] <Sean-Der> I have the strange issue of my remove #email div works until I remove ALL email divs
[18:48:32] <Sean-Der> then if I add a new email div it doesn't work anymore?
[18:48:56] <Sean-Der> In Firebug my code looks exactly the same?
[18:49:17] <eddiemonge> Sean-Der: why dont you just do .hide() and .show() instead of remove and recreate?
[18:49:51] <Sean-Der> It is for a form, if they set a value and then hide it. Won't that field still POST its variable?
[18:50:39] <Sean-Der> Thats what I was told :/
[18:50:44] <eddiemonge> Sean-Der: yeah but you can filter it out server side.
[18:50:44] <Es0teric> how do i remove anchor tags on click?

[18:51:41] <eddiemonge> Es0teric: $(anchor).click(function() { $(this).remove() })
[18:52:06] <eddiemonge> brianpWins: a status of 200 with some response text
[18:52:26] <brianpWins> hmmmm. yeah I can send that response and it still won't fire

[18:58:47] <chewed-on> eddiemonge: ok I got it
[18:58:51] <eddiemonge> Sean-Der: when you remove the element, you also remove the click handler
[18:58:53] <chewed-on> got an extra ; at line 152 :P
[18:59:07] <chewed-on> eddiemonge: but your script shows every single one of them when I mouse over any of the title element
[18:59:10] <eddiemonge> chewed-on: i never said it was accurate.
[18:59:17] <chewed-on> like all the drop down menu appear at once instead of one at a time.
[18:59:25] <chewed-on> Good start :D
[18:59:26] <eddiemonge> chewed-on: it was more of a "this may be a better way to write your code"

[19:12:53] <eddiemonge> Sean-Der: lol a dollar or two isnt even worth typing my email. thats like a quarter or two after fees.
[19:13:21] <eddiemonge> Es0teric: then do $('#id').click(function() { $(this).remove(); });

[19:17:10] <madprops> so apparently onClick won't be fired with the enter key
[19:17:55] <LostyJai> does html() not play nice in IE?
[19:18:19] <eddiemonge> madprops: no because enter isnt a click
[19:18:23] <eddiemonge> LostyJai: it does
[19:18:47] <LostyJai> doesn't work so well with me =/
[19:18:59] <eddiemonge> LostyJai: maybe its your code
[19:19:15] <LostyJai> <td id='tag1'> <span id='msg'></span> </td> <td id='tag2'> <span id='msg'></span> </td>
[19:19:34] <LostyJai> $('#tag1 #msg').html("something")
[19:19:35] <LostyJai> that works
[19:19:37] <LostyJai> but
[19:19:40] <LostyJai> $('#tag2 #msg').html("something")
[19:19:42] <LostyJai> doesn't work
[19:19:53] <LostyJai> any ideas?
[19:19:55] <cjheath> So I have a long-poll ajax call happening and I don't like the fact that Safari shows a spinner - can that be avoided?
[19:20:02] <brianpWins> something is wrong with #tag2
[19:20:08] <LostyJai> what is wrong with tag2 ?
[19:20:33] <eddiemonge> LostyJai: paste your actual code at jsfiddle
[19:20:53] <LostyJai> k..
[19:21:07] <brianpWins> eddiemonge: did you have a chance to peak at the link (http://pastie.org/2287644)
[19:21:09] <coldhead> cjheath: use a different browser?
[19:21:57] <cjheath> I'm targeting tmost browsers, just wndered if there was some setting on the XHR that woukd avoid it
[19:22:05] <cjheath> thx though :)
[19:22:39] <LostyJai> eddiemonge: and then?
[19:23:09] <eddiemonge> LostyJai: and then share it so we can see it
[19:23:28] <LostyJai> http://jsfiddle.net/zgpzU/
[19:24:05] <LostyJai> works flawless in firefox and chrome
[19:24:14] <LostyJai> but nooooooooooooooooo..... sales idiot wants it to work in IE
[19:24:15] <LostyJai> -_-
[19:25:44] <LostyJai> is it cause I use #msg multiple times?
[19:25:56] <LostyJai> and IE is an infant that does not understand the difference?
[19:27:15] <eddiemonge> LostyJai: that code needs a lot of work. tables, inline event handlers, not validated code...
[19:27:26] <LostyJai> inline event handlers?
[19:27:36] <LostyJai> what's wrong with the tables :)
[19:29:01] <eddiemonge> <form onsubmit="return false;">  <-- inline event handler
[19:29:18] <LostyJai> well...
[19:29:23] <LostyJai> i removed some of the code
[19:29:29] <LostyJai> it performs a php load
[19:29:34] <LostyJai> so.... yeah....
[19:29:36] <LostyJai> you can ignore that
[19:29:41] <LostyJai> that's not important
[19:29:52] <LostyJai> I'm just trying to get the error messages to show up
[19:30:09] <eddiemonge> <span id="err_msg"> should be class and not id
[19:30:51] <eddiemonge> thats probably what IE is dying on. Ids are unique on a page
[19:30:52] <LostyJai> I only use that to inject the error message
[19:30:57] <LostyJai> ic....
[19:31:03] <LostyJai> let me change it then
[19:32:32] <LostyJai> eddiemonge: genius!
[19:32:56] <madprops> how can i tackle this, i want to fill a div with posts of different sizes i dont want it to overflow the div, so i want to place posts until there is no space, or if the next post will overflow the div
[19:33:00] <eddiemonge> thats why validation is important

[22:50:54] <radiantstatic> Cork: Absolutely awesome. Totally missed that, thank you.
[22:51:03] <Cork> np
[23:05:50] <ale> hey guys! If I send "??" those 2 ?? over ajax it gets something like jQuery15107508828425054203_1311919261207...why can this be?!
[23:06:33] <ale> wtf?! can someone help me?
[23:13:09] <ale> someone please?
[23:13:23] <ShawnRisk> How do I fix this code: http://pastebin.com/G864JyQT  if I hit close the accordion the text will overlay over the next accordion.  How do I fix this?
[23:15:37] <na3r> how can i use metada in jquery ? i mean something like this <li class="{img=01.png,title='test'}"></li>
[23:16:09] <Cork> ale: the extra params added is to work around the browsers cache
[23:17:20] <Cork> ShawnRisk: use jsfiddle or jsbin instead
[23:17:29] <Cork> ShawnRisk: much easier to check live code
[23:17:47] <ShawnRisk> Cork: can I pm you the link?
[23:18:29] <Cork> ShawnRisk: donno if i have the time to dig through a webpage
[23:18:39] <ShawnRisk> I might have fixed this
[23:19:01] <Cork> na3r: what is that class name ment to do?
[23:19:53] <na3r> Cork, i wanna get img and title value with jqury
[23:20:37] <Cork> na3r: what value?
[23:20:44] <Cork> its in the class attribute
[23:21:10] <Cork> just do $('li').attr('class') though you should NEVER add data like that
[23:21:39] <Cork> na3r: do <li data-my_json="{img=01.png,title='test'}"></li> instead
[23:21:44] <Cork> or better
[23:22:06] <Cork> na3r: do <li data-my_json="{\"img\"="01.png","title"=\"test\"}"></li>
[23:22:10] <ShawnRisk> Cork: Where Note to the Friends are is the problem, one opens and closes but if you have one open and open the next the one before doesn't close.
[23:22:23] <na3r> Cork, well how can i get them?
[23:22:48] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse($('<li data-my_json="{\"img\"="01.png","title"=\"test\"}"></li>').data('my_json'))
[23:22:49] <bot-t> Cork: TypeError: div is undefined
[23:22:56] <Cork> uh.. div??
[23:23:06] <Cork> ah
[23:23:16] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse($('<li data-my_json="{\"img\"=\"01.png\",\"title\"=\"test\"}"></li>').data('my_json'))
[23:23:16] <bot-t> Cork: TypeError: div is undefined
[23:23:26] <Cork> hmm
[23:23:36] <Cork> ah, ya dubble escape
[23:24:41] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse($('<li data-my_json="{&quot;img&quot;=&quot;01.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;=&quot;test&quot;}"></li>').data('my_json'))
[23:24:42] <bot-t> Cork: TypeError: div is undefined
[23:24:48] * Cork hits bot-t
[23:31:00] <coldhead> you're so curiously pure
[23:33:32] <ShawnRisk> Cork: any ideas?
[23:35:13] <ShawnRisk> hi coldhead
[23:35:31] <coldhead> hi Shawn
[23:37:16] <Cork> ?p @ ShawnRisk
[23:37:17] <bot-t> ShawnRisk, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:37:23] <ShawnRisk> :D
[23:37:35] <ShawnRisk> pastebin is okay?
[23:37:38] <Cork> best way is to work through the bug and reduce it
[23:39:24] <ShawnRisk> okay
[23:39:58] <coldhead> pastebin is less okay because it doesn't create a working demo
[23:40:02] <ShawnRisk> http://pastebin.com/g5pgg2kg
[23:40:15] <coldhead> and we have to imagine how it works, instead of actually see it
[23:40:27] <Cork> ShawnRisk: not really as pastebin is dead code
[23:40:35] <ShawnRisk> I sent you the Cork
[23:40:38] <ShawnRisk> link
[23:40:40] <Cork> jsfiddle or jsbin lets you run the code
[23:40:51] <Cork> ShawnRisk: check your status window
[23:43:57] <ShawnRisk> Cork: I don't see how to fix this.
[23:44:09] <ShawnRisk> oh wait
[23:44:44] <coldhead> case closed?
[23:46:31] <ShawnRisk> nope
[23:46:58] <ShawnRisk> it is still not closing the first accordion I open.  It is leaving that one open and opening the second one so there are two open.
[23:47:04] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: pm link?
[23:48:02] <coldhead> alright
[23:48:14] <coldhead> but if it looks garish i will have to close the window
[23:49:05] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: under Note to the Friends is the first accordion and so on
[23:52:20] <ShawnRisk> any thoughts?
[23:52:21] <KineticColor> Anyone want to help me understand why http://kineticcolor.com/Test/page1.html works but http://kineticcolor.com/index.html doesnt
[23:53:12] <KineticColor> @ShawnRisk Re-ask the question please
[23:53:52] <ShawnRisk> I did above and Cork and coldhead said they would look at this
[23:54:24] <KineticColor> Anyone want to help me understand why http://kineticcolor.com/Test/page1.html works but http://kineticcolor.com/index.html doesnt -- Sorry, I know why it doesnt work, because my content is being pulled by another script, so to rephase: How do I make the latter work
[23:54:31] <KineticColor> @ShawnRisk oh nvm then
[23:56:35] <KineticColor> Anyone have a clue?
[23:57:59] * charged_bolt gives out a clue
[23:58:01] <tanner> Is there some way I can use jquery to trigger the changed event on an option element?
[23:59:04] <sk8ball> what is the matter w/ $('#container').height(two);
[23:59:09] <coldhead> i really don't understand why you're making this so complicated, ShawnRisk
[23:59:12] <sk8ball> i'm trying to set the height of a div
[23:59:20] <coldhead> i would just use slideToggle
[23:59:23] <Cork> ShawnRisk: no we asked for a live code example
[23:59:30] <sk8ball> two being a var containging an integer
[23:59:32] <coldhead> and not bind new click handlers inside click handlers
