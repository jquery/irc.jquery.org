[00:02:22] <BlankVerse> noob question : http://jsfiddle.net/uJwdR/ , data is a object i want the json string isntead
[00:02:53] <BlankVerse> data.responseText?
[00:08:23] <ryanseddon> BlankVerse: if you don't want jQuery to convert your json data to an object then change your dataType to text in the ajax request
[00:09:20] <ryanseddon> er, that should be *not* convert
[00:25:18] <theBrettman> anyone on can help me out?
[00:25:54] <MoTiOnXml> $(selector).draggables doesn't seem to fire the events in the jQuery draggable widget for IE8
[00:26:24] <MoTiOnXml> i can see it's picking up the options etc. but nothing works; no errors tho', just nothing happens when dragging the draggables
[00:26:32] <theBrettman> I want to use $.post() to send the results of a form on a webpage like 20,000 times (for some contest) but I'm not sure if it's possible cuz idk y it isn't working...
[00:26:35] <MoTiOnXml> chrome, ie9, safari
[00:26:49] <Me-Selfe> MoTiOnXml: draggables?
[00:27:00] <MoTiOnXml> Me-Selfe: yes? from the jQuery UI
[00:27:13] <theBrettman> event.preventDefault() is supposed to stop the form's action but the page still refreshes...
[00:27:16] <Me-Selfe> its "draggable", not draggables
[00:27:26] <MoTiOnXml> yea, i'm just writing on IRC here
[00:27:26] <theBrettman> does jquery not work when u inject it into a pages code or what?
[00:27:27] <Me-Selfe> erm
[00:27:39] <MoTiOnXml> like I said it works in other browsers but IE8
[00:27:49] <MoTiOnXml> or the IE8 rendering mode in IE9, rather
[00:28:01] <theBrettman> IE will always be fail!
[00:28:11] <theBrettman> IE(= still fail
[00:28:12] <Me-Selfe> MoTiOnXml: you got the newest version of jquery-ui?
[00:28:21] <theBrettman> *IE9 = still fail
[00:28:47] <MoTiOnXml> theBrettman: don't follow you regarding IE9 = still fail
[00:29:11] <Me-Selfe> MoTiOnXml: you don't get any errors, just no dragging?
[00:29:15] <MoTiOnXml> yes
[00:29:19] <MoTiOnXml> no errors, just no dragging
[00:29:20] <theBrettman> use it for awhile and u'll see. but they did try to copy as much from google chrome as possible
[00:29:43] <theBrettman> but they still aren't compliant with everything including some old stuff...
[00:29:44] <MoTiOnXml> theBrettman: i'm really busy right now, going for a meeting, so spare me that, ok? take it somewhere else
[00:29:57] <Me-Selfe> MoTiOnXml: tried it in IE8, or just IE9 with rendering mode?
[00:30:01] <MoTiOnXml> Me-Selfe: running jquery-ui-1.8.13.custom.min.js
[00:30:07] <MoTiOnXml> Me-Selfe: saw that .14 was out
[00:30:35] <MoTiOnXml> ah fuck, it's fixed for IE8
[00:30:40] <MoTiOnXml> will have to upgrade then .. thanks
[00:30:49] <Me-Selfe> I just had a draggable problem that worked in ie9 in rendering mode, but failed in IE8 :p
[00:31:50] <MoTiOnXml> Me-Selfe: \o big thanks - cya after the meeting
[00:32:12] <theBrettman> so if I add jquery to a page that didn't originally have it, does anyone know if it works after everything has already been loaded? I thought it was supposed to...
[00:32:34] <theBrettman> like I mean in code with developer tools
[00:33:25] <Me-Selfe> theBrettman: The page should still work like before you add jquery
[00:33:39] <theBrettman> I'm trying to hack a page...
[00:33:43] <theBrettman> it has a form
[00:33:56] <theBrettman> I just want to post 20,000 times
[00:33:57] <aaronmcadam> are you using jQuerify
[00:34:12] <theBrettman> no
[00:34:17] <Me-Selfe> theBrettman: hack a page? Seem like you're in the wrong channel...
[00:34:21] <aaronmcadam> well it should just work
[00:34:23] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[00:34:26] <aaronmcadam> twat
[00:34:28] <theBrettman> not malicious
[00:34:40] <aaronmcadam> haha
[00:34:44] <theBrettman> I just want to post 20,000 times
[00:34:48] <aaronmcadam> yeah cool
[00:34:53] <aaronmcadam> should work
[00:35:01] <theBrettman> it's not and I'm not sure y
[00:35:03] <aaronmcadam> i know jQuerify works fine
[00:35:15] <aaronmcadam> with firebug
[00:35:16] <theBrettman> I'm just using the jquery library
[00:35:22] <theBrettman> it has .post()
[00:35:23] <aaronmcadam> so why are you asking
[00:35:34] <aaronmcadam> oh i thought u said you're not
[00:35:35] <theBrettman> I'm trying to figure out y it won't work
[00:35:42] <theBrettman> I can show u the page and the code I'm trying to use
[00:35:47] <aaronmcadam> you'renot following me
[00:36:01] <theBrettman> u said jquerify. sounds like a jquery plugin
[00:36:07] <theBrettman> lol
[00:36:08] <aaronmcadam> no it's not
[00:36:36] <theBrettman> k, anyway. I'm pretty sure it should work. I can show u the code and give u a link and u can see for urself. doesn't make sense
[00:36:36] <aaronmcadam> it attaches jquery to any page
[00:36:43] <theBrettman> oh, I see
[00:36:47] <theBrettman> is it for chrome?
[00:36:56] <aaronmcadam> it's a bookmarklet
[00:36:58] <aaronmcadam> so should work
[00:37:05] <aaronmcadam> it's integrated into firebug though too
[00:37:07] <theBrettman> I have jsshell. it's supposed to be better
[00:37:08] <aaronmcadam> one sec
[00:37:17] <aaronmcadam> yeah but that'd be just js
[00:37:38] <theBrettman> but I think it won't work unless it's in the page instead cuz something to do with having to click the submit button
[00:38:00] <theBrettman> jsshell has me "run" the code but that throws an error
[00:38:11] <aaronmcadam> just use jquerify see ?jquerify @ theBrettman
[00:38:12] <bot-t> a bookmarklet that injects jQuery into the current page for use with Firebug's console - http://www.learningjquery.com/2006/12/jquerify-bookmarklet
[00:38:15] <theBrettman> when the code should run when I click submit instead, lol
[00:38:35] <theBrettman> yeah, sounds good
[00:38:42] <theBrettman> then I'll just paste my script in
[00:38:48] <aaronmcadam> just edit the source to pull in the latest jquery
[00:39:00] <theBrettman> well, that's what I did
[00:39:08] <aaronmcadam> use this one
[00:39:09] <aaronmcadam> http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/04/better-stronger-safer-jquerify-bookmarklet
[00:39:12] <theBrettman> I just added script
[00:39:18] <gym_jane> guys i need your help
[00:39:20] <theBrettman> and then added my script also
[00:39:23] <gym_jane> what is wrong with my code here? http://jsfiddle.net/6VDu8/
[00:39:26] <aaronmcadam> ?don't ask
[00:39:34] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Tuesday, 2011-06-21 - http://services.jquery.com/#jquery_20110621.log.html
[00:39:40] <gym_jane> the quotes bit doesn't execute sometimes
[00:40:14] <aaronmcadam> what line?
[00:40:16] <gym_jane> hence all my testimonials appear vertically instead of fading in and out but when i refresh the page it is ok
[00:40:35] <gym_jane> fading in and out one by one*
[00:40:53] <aaronmcadam> gym_jane, set up ur fiddle properly, maybe using jQuery and some html would help
[00:40:59] <gym_jane> ok
[00:41:14] <aaronmcadam> you've set to mootools you know
[00:42:29] <gym_jane> http://jsfiddle.net/6VDu8/4/
[00:42:35] <gym_jane> now it doesn't even work :/
[00:43:11] <aaronmcadam> it didn't "even work" before either
[00:43:23] <bjensen> is it just as fast for jquery to search after data attributes than it is to search through classes?
[00:43:24] <gym_jane> it does on my localhost
[00:43:31] <aaronmcadam> duh
[00:43:43] <aaronmcadam> you need to abstract your problem to make it work on jsfiddle
[00:44:01] <gym_jane> this is exactly what i got in my localhost http://jsfiddle.net/6VDu8/5/
[00:44:02] <aaronmcadam> and for us to help u better, remove anything that isn't part of the problem you're trying to solve
[00:44:23] <aaronmcadam> syntax error gym_jane that's why
[00:44:34] <aaronmcadam> use firebug you know
[00:44:57] <gym_jane> am using chrome console it is not throwing any errors
[00:44:58] <aaronmcadam> line 37
[00:45:12] <aaronmcadam> you've got an extra });
[00:45:45] <gym_jane> let me beautify that, one sec please
[00:46:01] <aaronmcadam> remove the mentions of sub menu too
[00:46:12] <aaronmcadam> and leave only html to do with quotes as well
[00:46:29] <gym_jane> http://jsfiddle.net/6VDu8/7/
[00:46:49] <gym_jane> I do need the submenu bit though, i guess i could include that once i have sorted this out
[00:47:06] <aaronmcadam> you should only include source for your problem
[00:47:21] <aaronmcadam> i don't need to know about a sub menu when u want help with something else
[00:47:27] <gym_jane> sure
[00:47:31] <aaronmcadam> missing } in XML expression
[00:47:35] <aaronmcadam> $('.quotes .slide').hide();
[00:47:40] <aaronmcadam> line 20
[00:47:40] <aaronmcadam> ...
[00:48:01] <gym_jane> is that causing the issue?
[00:48:02] <aaronmcadam> haha
[00:48:13] <aaronmcadam> you're including script tags in js code
[00:48:30] <aaronmcadam> you don't need document ready, you're setting that in the dropdown on the left remember
[00:48:38] <aaronmcadam> think people need a tutorial on jsfiddle on this
[00:48:39] <gym_jane> removed now http://jsfiddle.net/6VDu8/9/
[00:49:23] <aaronmcadam> syntax errors still
[00:49:35] <aaronmcadam> didn't close your function
[00:49:41] <aaronmcadam> on the fadeIn
[00:49:45] <gym_jane> http://jsfiddle.net/6VDu8/12/
[00:50:06] <Me-Selfe> hm
[00:50:08] <gym_jane> i am lost
[00:50:10] <aaronmcadam> still the same error
[00:50:36] <Me-Selfe> gym_jane: as aaronmcadam said, you need to close fadeIn/document.ready
[00:50:36] <aaronmcadam> gym_jane, http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/6VDu8/13/
[00:50:57] <aaronmcadam> it's working for me
[00:51:23] <aaronmcadam> looks like your logic's a bit screwed for when to fade in but it's working
[00:51:23] <gym_jane> your version shows all the quotes
[00:51:41] <aaronmcadam> all i did was clsoe your function
[00:51:55] <aaronmcadam> initially they're all hidden
[00:51:56] <gym_jane> so something else is wrong
[00:52:01] <aaronmcadam> your logic is fooked
[00:52:09] <gym_jane> yeh the first one show only one then it shows all
[00:52:28] <Me-Selfe> gym_jane: what are you trying to do?
[00:52:35] <krz> how do i check if a div was clicked on?
[00:52:38] <aaronmcadam> check the fiddle
[00:52:42] <gym_jane> Me-Selfe show each quote one by one
[00:53:02] <gym_jane> i have been pulling my hair out over this :(
[00:53:05] <aaronmcadam> hang on gym
[00:53:10] <aaronmcadam> use the bloody cycle plugin
[00:53:13] <aaronmcadam> delete that code
[00:53:19] <aaronmcadam> and use jquery cycle
[00:53:25] <aaronmcadam> it does exactly what you're tryin to do
[00:53:34] <aaronmcadam> ?cycle @ gym_jane

[01:00:24] <gym_jane> let me seee :D
[01:00:29] <gym_jane> yeh
[01:00:32] <gym_jane> let me try that here :D
[01:00:34] <gym_jane> thank you
[01:00:34] <aaronmcadam> http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/options.html
[01:00:40] <aaronmcadam> if u need to set anything
[01:00:43] <[1]bob> endy_c $('document').ready() or $('window').load
[01:00:55] <gym_jane> u didn't change the html bit, did you?
[01:01:03] <aaronmcadam> nope not at all
[01:01:07] <gym_jane> woah
[01:01:09] <gym_jane> kewl
[01:01:12] <aaronmcadam> ye[
[01:01:18] <gym_jane> brb trying offline
[01:01:19] <aaronmcadam> did u see what i said before?
[01:01:24] <gym_jane> yeh
[01:01:26] <[1]bob> krz maybe you're misplacing your function
[01:01:29] <gym_jane> can't believe how easy that was
[01:01:31] <aaronmcadam> it will cycle any children of a parent
[01:01:40] <gym_jane> and here i was spending all night last night on it
[01:01:40] <aaronmcadam> yep
[01:01:47] <krz> [1]bob: i just need to figure out which div in body was clicked
[01:01:52] <krz> not so hard to understand
[01:01:55] <aaronmcadam> ha well you gotta learn what plugins are available
[01:02:00] <aaronmcadam> easily done tho
[01:02:07] <aaronmcadam> don't blame yourself
[01:02:10] <[1]bob> krz pastebin your code please
[01:02:13] <aaronmcadam> maybe u learned somethin
[01:03:16] <krz> [1]bob: http://pastie.org/2171180
[01:04:59] <[1]bob> is body a div you named like that (id) or the body of your page ?
[01:05:49] <gym_jane> yes :)
[01:05:55] <dvgsvc> anyone knows the answer to this?http://forum.jquery.com/topic/multiple-item-selection
[01:06:02] <gym_jane> gotta look at options to slow it down abit :)
[01:07:12] <krz> [1]bob: no, i have divs all over the body
[01:07:31] <krz> i just need to figure out which div in the body element was clicked
[01:08:00] <Me-Selfe> krz: you want to be able to click on multiple divs? or just the one=?
[01:09:11] <[1]bob> maybe if you give your divs a class and replace body with .nameOfClass
[01:10:37] <krz> [1]bob Me-Selfe http://pastie.org/2171204
[01:10:55] <krz> if user clicks anywhere in body, it hides the dropdown menu
[01:11:08] <krz> but if users clicks anywhere in the dropdown menu, it shouldnt hide the menu
[01:11:13] <krz> thats what im really trying to do
[01:11:46] <Me-Selfe> krz: you need to add click to the menu, then stopPropagation..
[01:12:10] <Me-Selfe> So, if you click on the menu, the click event doesn't bubble to the body
[01:12:31] <aaronmcadam> gym_jane, timeout
[01:12:36] <krz> hm
[01:12:43] <krz> good call. let me see what i can do
[01:12:48] <gym_jane> i used speed
[01:13:01] <aaronmcadam> cool cool
[01:13:09] <aaronmcadam> i accept donations you kno :P
[01:13:14] <aaronmcadam> haha just kidding :D
[01:13:17] <gym_jane> hihi
[01:13:20] <Me-Selfe> like $('ul#account_dropdown_menu').click ( function (event) { event.stopPropagation() });
[01:13:23] <Me-Selfe> krz
[01:13:33] <Me-Selfe> *something like
[01:14:53] <krz> thanks Me-Selfe that worked wonderfully
[01:15:27] <gym_jane> aaronmcadam and Me-Selfe thank you very much
[01:15:31] <aaronmcadam> no probs
[01:15:32] <gym_jane> saved me
[01:15:44] <aaronmcadam> always have a look at see ?g jquery list

[01:16:01] <aaronmcadam> before you try to do something yourself
[01:16:32] <gym_jane> didnt know that site existed
[01:16:34] <gym_jane> thank you
[01:16:43] <aaronmcadam> no probs
[01:16:51] <equivoc> how ist this menutype http://www.dior.com/ called and is there a similiar jquery plugin around?

[01:17:15] <bot-t> equivoc, FireQuery is a Firebug extension for jQuery development - http://firequery.binaryage.com/
[01:17:39] <aaronmcadam> use that to examine what functions are attached to a dom object
[01:18:00] <aaronmcadam> you examine the html in the html tab and it tells you what events are being fired off an element
[01:18:17] <equivoc> aaronmcadam: okay, will check it out, thx
[01:18:20] <aaronmcadam> no probs
[01:18:30] <gym_jane> is there one for chrome?
[01:18:34] <gym_jane> googling now
[01:18:37] <aaronmcadam> you can then examine it further and find the actual function being called
[01:18:44] <aaronmcadam> not that I know of
[01:18:55] <aaronmcadam> chrome tools are good but still way behind
[01:21:09] <Me-Selfe> aaronmcadam: imo, the chrome debugging works quite well
[01:21:17] <aaronmcadam> i like it's profiler

[01:32:54] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[01:33:00] <sean`> I'm new to jqueries so I don't know this really
[01:33:09] <aaronmcadam> ?translate yes to irish
[01:33:25] <aaronmcadam> dammit
[01:33:26] <theBrettman> I wonder if I'm mistaking what $.post() is used for. can I use it to actually send information? or does that only work on $.form()?
[01:33:38] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[01:33:40] <sean`> what's $.form
[01:33:44] <aaronmcadam> ?form
[01:33:45] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Plugins/Validation/Validator/form - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Validator/form
[01:33:48] <aaronmcadam> heh
[01:33:52] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[01:33:58] <aaronmcadam> can ajax actually be used to send information
[01:33:59] <Me-Selfe> sean`: you can send data with $.post
[01:34:00] <sean`> there's no .form in jquery (core)
[01:34:03] <aaronmcadam> let's think about that
[01:34:12] <sean`> Me-Selfe, stop talking to me
[01:34:18] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[01:34:19] <sean`> you make me self-concius
[01:34:20] <sean`> iuos
[01:34:25] <sean`> ious
[01:34:27] <theBrettman> yes, ur right sean. it's a plugin
[01:34:36] <Me-Selfe> aaronmcadam: afaik, you can't send with data to the server with ajax..
[01:34:36] <sean`> well BRETTMAN
[01:34:42] <sean`> You can send data using $.post
[01:34:44] <aaronmcadam> haha
[01:34:45] <Me-Selfe> *send data
[01:34:47] <theBrettman> ok
[01:34:50] <aaronmcadam> of course you can
[01:34:54] <theBrettman> wonder y it's not working
[01:34:55] <sean`> lollololol.
[01:34:58] <theBrettman> grrr
[01:34:58] <sean`> ?post
[01:34:59] <bot-t> jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[01:35:02] <aaronmcadam> wtf do u think an XHR is>?
[01:35:16] <sean`> $.post ('page', $('form').serialize ());
[01:35:18] <theBrettman> I got a page that I don't want to go to the submit page but it does anyway
[01:35:18] <Me-Selfe> </irony>
[01:35:19] <aaronmcadam> weee
[01:35:30] <shkiper> sean`: I have a problem but I couldn't form it English well, I guess
[01:35:38] <sean`> BRETTMAN, you need to disable the default action
[01:36:01] <sean`> but, above all.. if we don't know what you're doing, using, we won't know what's wrong or could be improved
[01:36:13] <sean`> so, guide is, with your little shining lite
[01:36:26] <theBrettman> I did with event.preventDefault()
[01:36:49] <theBrettman> my syntax is good. should work... doesn't
[01:37:30] <theBrettman> ok, maybe I should pastebin my script and give u a link to the page I want to use it on...

[01:38:20] <aaronmcadam> use fiddle
[01:38:27] <sean`> tabmuncher
[01:42:45] <theBrettman> um wow, how do I use that jsfiddle thing?
[01:43:05] <theBrettman> I have to paste the page source or something?
[01:43:21] <ThiefMaster|work> eh, isn't jsfiddle pretty much self-explaining?
[01:43:29] <Me-Selfe> theBrettman: Reading documentation for stuff is a great way to learn ;)
[01:43:31] <aaronmcadam> just the html and js u need to solve your actual problem
[01:43:45] <aaronmcadam> ThiefMaster|work, oh god no, I've had to explain to loads
[01:43:50] <Me-Selfe> It would make this chan quite absolute tho :)
[01:43:50] <ThiefMaster|work> can anyone suggest a nice jquery based dropdown (context-)menu plugin that also allows togglable menu items (w/ checkboxes)?
[01:44:08] <stan_man_can> Me-Selfe: why would people read documentation once they find IRC? Isn't that what we're here for?
[01:44:29] <theBrettman> it's a cool tool, not what I expected, lol
[01:45:08] <theBrettman> not sure that it will be a good idea tho. it will probably prevent the action page from loading anyway
[01:45:09] <Me-Selfe> stan_man_can: Documentation is overrated anyway, it just tell you how to do stuff.. :)
[01:47:00] <theBrettman> and how do I show u what's on jsfiddle?
[01:47:33] <stan_man_can> theBrettman: Let me read the docs and tell you how to do it one sec
[01:47:47] <xec> theBrettman: hit save and copypaste url :p
[01:48:30] <theBrettman> http://jsfiddle.net/JzyEN/
[01:48:36] <theBrettman> works on there. doesn't work in the page
[01:49:08] <theBrettman> and I'm adding <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js"></script> to the page I'm using it on
[01:49:27] <xec> theBrettman: is your page live? do you have an url?
[01:49:45] <theBrettman> http://thefresharmy.com/vote_for_ring_girl
[01:50:20] <stan_man_can> theBrettman: it's good habbit to add the "type" into the script, 'type="text/javascript"'
[01:50:46] <Skizu> Hey anyone got a few minutes for a noob ?
[01:50:58] <stan_man_can> Skizu: don't ask to ask
[01:51:00] <stan_man_can> `ask
[01:51:03] <stan_man_can> ?ask
[01:51:06] <Skizu> Lol
[01:51:15] <Skizu> Ok well i want to do something like
[01:51:29] <Skizu> $("#id.class").value
[01:51:39] <Skizu> Can i do that ? Idk how to word it for google
[01:51:41] <Skizu> xD
[01:51:43] <aljosa> how can i bind a function to select change event, when user selects different option in select element? $("select").what()?
[01:51:54] <Me-Selfe> stan_man_can: haha, the irony of that comment is that its often true .p
[01:51:55] <stan_man_can> theBrettman: I don't see your JS on that page?
[01:52:18] <theBrettman> it's not my page. I put it into the code with web developer tools
[01:52:21] <Me-Selfe> Skizu: you want to get the value of something, or set the value?
[01:52:32] <Skizu> Get the value
[01:52:46] <stan_man_can> Skizu: did you even test that first???? you're doing it properly...  alert($("#id.class").value());
[01:52:58] <Skizu> ye well its saying....
[01:53:01] <Skizu> undefined
[01:53:05] <Skizu> So i'm guessing it isnt lol
[01:53:23] <stan_man_can> then you're selecting it wrong
[01:53:44] <stan_man_can> but without seeing your code we can't suggest how you _should_ select it, so maybe a pastebin would be helpful
[01:53:46] <theBrettman> if ur using #id, u  shouldn't need .class
[01:54:09] <aaronmcadam> no
[01:54:12] <aaronmcadam> use .val()
[01:54:20] <aaronmcadam> .value() is wrong
[01:54:40] <stan_man_can> aaronmcadam: I'm going to leave now. Clearly it's too late for me to be useful.
[01:54:53] <aaronmcadam> ah haha
[01:54:53] <stan_man_can> Skizu: aaronmcadams right, it's .val()
[01:54:59] <stan_man_can> I'm off to bed now :| g'night all.
[01:55:02] <Me-Selfe> nn
[01:55:04] <theBrettman> gn
[01:55:14] <Skizu> Still slapping me around the face with underfined
[01:55:39] <Me-Selfe> Skizu: whats the code that give you the error?
[01:56:39] <theBrettman> what element r u trying to get the value of?

[01:58:21] <Skizu> Lol k
[01:58:39] <Skizu> Well ye that's my paste bin - before you ask ye its in a div with the id Login
[01:58:43] <edbaffei> Hi,.. i have a search method that might return over a thousand objects. I would like to chunk the results so that the first 100 get shown while the rest are being fetched in the background
[01:58:43] <aaronmcadam> it's so everyone can see your problem and learn the solution
[01:59:14] <edbaffei> are there any proven strategies on how this should be done?
[01:59:18] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[01:59:28] <aaronmcadam> checking a count would be very inefficient
[01:59:50] <aaronmcadam> but if you're looping anyway to render the data...
[02:00:02] <Skizu> Doing it in the code itself might be the best - breaking the search itself ?
[02:00:05] <Me-Selfe> Skizu: if you want the content of a <div>, use .html()
[02:00:12] <Skizu> No
[02:00:20] <Skizu> I just want the value for the 2 input boxes
[02:00:34] <theBrettman> checkout jlinq
[02:00:44] <Skizu> cba to make them id's and there's multiple classes called Email
[02:00:47] <theBrettman> it takes all the mess out of exactly what ur trying to do
[02:00:55] <Skizu> Hence why i wanna do #Login.Email
[02:01:00] <aaronmcadam> Skizu, don't use inline onclick attributeas
[02:01:01] <Skizu> But it's slapping me in the face :P
[02:01:04] <aaronmcadam> attributes*
[02:01:11] <aaronmcadam> or onsubmits
[02:01:13] <Skizu> I wont :P
[02:01:15] <aaronmcadam> goddammit are you in 1997?
[02:01:17] <Skizu> It's just for quickness
[02:01:33] <aaronmcadam> it's not
[02:01:33] <anavel> hai
[02:01:41] <Skizu> It is for now lol
[02:01:43] <aaronmcadam> any delusions of that are wrong
[02:01:48] <aaronmcadam> do it right from the start
[02:01:51] <anavel> when i open a dialog, how to disable the main window ?
[02:01:57] <Me-Selfe> Skizu: you refer to element id's, but the elements don't have id's. Add like: id='email', then $('#email').val()
[02:01:57] <Skizu> >_> help me with my problem please
[02:01:59] <anavel> modal doesn't work :|
[02:02:00] <aaronmcadam> pass it as a modal
[02:02:09] <Skizu> >_>
[02:02:15] <Skizu> No Me-Selfe
[02:02:22] <anavel> i've put dialog({ modal: true });
[02:02:29] <aaronmcadam> .Email
[02:02:41] <Skizu> I've <div id="Login"><input type="text" class="Email" /></div>
[02:02:43] <Skizu> For example
[02:02:57] <Skizu> I want $('#Login.Email').val()
[02:03:01] <Skizu> But returns underfined
[02:03:01] <Me-Selfe> darn, i love to help people :p
[02:03:04] <theBrettman> actually, jlinq will fix both of ur problems
[02:03:11] <anavel> Skizu: oh i c.
[02:03:14] <aaronmcadam> haha
[02:03:21] <aaronmcadam> your selector is wrong
[02:03:30] <anavel> Skizu: try $("div#Login input.Email)
[02:03:32] <aaronmcadam> that's why
[02:03:33] <anavel> Skizu: try $("div#Login input.Email")
[02:03:43] <aaronmcadam> you don't need to specify
[02:03:45] <Skizu> Cheers anavel 2 secs
[02:03:48] <aaronmcadam> just .Email
[02:03:57] <Skizu> Cant do just .Email
[02:03:59] <anavel> aaronmcadam suggestion is right to.
[02:03:59] <Skizu> There's multiple
[02:04:04] <aaronmcadam> overly specific selectors suck
[02:04:11] <Skizu> That's the reason i didnt just use an id :p
[02:04:16] <anavel> oh, multiple Email class use, huh ?
[02:04:24] <aaronmcadam> just '#Login .Email'
[02:04:32] <aaronmcadam> you didn't put a space between the id and class
[02:04:33] <anavel> or just put id on your input.
[02:04:38] <aaronmcadam> you do know what u were doing
[02:04:56] <aaronmcadam> your selector was saying "select the email with an id of "Login" AND a class of "Email"
[02:05:00] <anavel> so uhm, aaronmcadam. how to disable main window. modal: true doesn't work.
[02:05:13] <Skizu> Thanks anavel you sexy beast ;)
[02:05:13] <aaronmcadam> using jquery ui?
[02:05:21] <anavel> aaronmcadam: yes
[02:05:27] <anavel> Skizu: $("div#Login input.Email") works ?
[02:05:29] <sagdfg> hi all, can i load a photo with jquery ajax function ? the foto is returned by a php script using the GD library
[02:05:33] <Skizu> Ye
[02:05:38] <anavel> alright :)
[02:05:38] <Skizu> You needed a space ?
[02:05:40] <Skizu> That's all?
[02:05:41] <Skizu> FML lol
[02:05:42] <keir_> whats a good solution for creating a database for someone who doesnt know mysql and can't afford a proper guy to build it :P?
[02:05:45] <anavel> Skizu: lol
[02:05:50] <anavel> Skizu: space happens :P
[02:05:58] <Skizu> Lol
[02:06:00] <aaronmcadam> keir_, swift kick in the balls
[02:06:13] <anavel> keir_: let him teach himselves.
[02:06:14] <theBrettman> mysql = easy
[02:06:24] <anavel> so uhm, aaronmcadam. how to disable main window. modal: true doesn't work....
[02:06:46] <theBrettman> basic php is what u need or whatever other scripting language u wanna use
[02:06:58] <theBrettman> learn the basics on w3schools
[02:07:02] <Skizu> I can help with PHP o:
[02:07:03] <aaronmcadam> impossible to say
[02:07:12] <aaronmcadam> I can't see your monitor you know
[02:07:17] <keir_> mysql is pretty verbose from what ive seen
[02:07:21] <Skizu> Changing from prototype to jQuery is a bitch XD so close but so far the 2 are :p
[02:07:22] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[02:07:28] <anavel> aaronmcadam: i still can interact with stuff on main window.
[02:07:29] <aaronmcadam> what you talking about keir_
[02:07:30] <Skizu> - sorry for the language -
[02:08:14] <theBrettman> so, anyone wanna help with my problem? guess I have to post it all over, huh?
[02:08:37] <theBrettman> here it is working on jfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/JzyEN/
[02:08:48] <aaronmcadam> aaah
[02:08:54] <aaronmcadam> DON'T recommend w3schools!
[02:08:58] <Skizu> anavel: What would that be called btw - if i was to search google lol?
[02:09:01] <aaronmcadam> fucking bain of the internet
[02:09:04] <theBrettman> here is the page I'm pasting my code into: http://thefresharmy.com/vote_for_ring_girl
[02:09:15] <Skizu> $('element') ?
[02:09:49] <anavel> hmmm
[02:10:22] <anavel> explicitly do disable could work. just add .disable class :D
[02:10:25] <theBrettman> the only thing I can think of is that I can't paste jquery into a page with web developer tools and expect it to work? idk...
[02:10:30] <anavel> lol the pain xD
[02:11:07] <Skizu> Brettman what are you trying to do btw xD?
[02:11:09] <anavel> off trying.
[02:11:10] <keir_> what exactly are you trying to do brettman?
[02:11:24] <theBrettman> trying to preventDefault() basically
[02:11:25] <Skizu> keir_: Lol
[02:11:35] <theBrettman> on form submit
[02:11:46] <Skizu> theBretman: RTFM
[02:11:47] <Skizu> :3
[02:12:08] <theBrettman> my code works on jsfiddle
[02:12:34] <theBrettman> u didn't see the link?
[02:13:25] <Skizu> I saw it
[02:13:57] <theBrettman> I'm guessing RTFM mean's "Read The Freaking Manual"?
[02:14:14] <aaronmcadam> fucking, but yea
[02:14:20] <theBrettman> rofl
[02:14:24] <aaronmcadam> :p
[02:14:25] <theBrettman> u said it
[02:14:29] <aaronmcadam> i did surely
[02:14:41] <Skizu> Friendly
[02:14:50] <Skizu> Read The Friendly Manual :)
[02:14:52] <theBrettman> so, if I paste jquery into a page, I can use it or what?
[02:15:10] <Skizu> ye
[02:15:18] <theBrettman> like if I find a page online and it doesn't contain jquery but I add it, I can use it?
[02:15:31] <Skizu> (need to put in script tags or into a js file thought obviously)
[02:15:33] <aaronmcadam> are you still trying that
[02:15:37] <theBrettman> yes, I did
[02:15:58] <keir_> theBrettman: have you included the jquery library in your page??
[02:16:07] <theBrettman> both the jquery and my script r in script tags
[02:16:21] <theBrettman> it's not my page but yes, I included the jquery script
[02:16:24] <larsemil> i am using jscrollpane and need to add padding bellow scroller, but cant find out how. any guess? adding padding to div containing scroller works, but cant do that in stylesheet, only in firebug... :/
[02:16:27] <aaronmcadam> what?
[02:16:31] <theBrettman> using jquery's latest
[02:16:44] <aaronmcadam> did u try the jQuerify bookmarklet
[02:16:44] <larsemil> so guessing there is something in the jscrollpane setting padding to 0
[02:17:08] <theBrettman> no, but I guess I will try it
[02:17:12] <aaronmcadam> you could then maybe use see ?getScript in the console
[02:17:12] <bot-t> jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[02:17:16] <aaronmcadam> ah jesus i told u do ages ago
[02:17:33] <theBrettman> I don't see what's different between that and just adding <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[02:17:35] <Skizu> brettman you've not included the jQuery libs nor the script you posted on jsfiddle on the page you said as far as i can see
[02:17:45] <aaronmcadam> you might run into sop issues tho ?sop @ theBrettman
[02:18:01] <keir_> so your trying to execute jquery that your injecting into someones page using firebug?
[02:18:02] <theBrettman> I keep saying that's not my page and I'm trying to add it with web developer tools...
[02:18:19] <theBrettman> yeah, except with google chrome
[02:18:24] <aaronmcadam> try it would u
[02:18:34] <theBrettman> yes, I will
[02:18:43] <Hirmon> Moin
[02:19:02] <keir_> lol
[02:19:10] <keir_> the ethics are dubious :P
[02:20:14] <ffxr> Hi i am trying te get a seq of animations to run one after one another on different div; i have got this far -> http://jsfiddle.net/KatVS/1/ , but for reasons beyond my comprehension the last animation is getting looped. can anyone offer any words of assistance? ( bottom red div 'film' to start the function) thanks!
[02:22:22] <aaronmcadam> ?bot down>?
[02:22:24] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, #9076 (select drop down hover highlight resets on focus query in ... - Opened 2 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9076
[02:22:31] <aaronmcadam> ?say hi
[02:22:31] <bot-t> ...
[02:22:44] <theBrettman> um, how do I get the jquerify bookmarklet? it doesn't make sense...
[02:22:45] <aaronmcadam> ?say "i'm alive"
[02:22:46] <bot-t> ...
[02:23:00] <aaronmcadam> u do know what a bookmarklet is right
[02:23:06] <theBrettman> nope
[02:23:14] <chris245> Hello all. I have a form with several spans in it. Each span may contain other spans (the level is unlimited). Each span can be "selected".
[02:23:18] <aaronmcadam> ?g bookmarklet @ theBrettman
[02:23:19] <bot-t> theBrettman, Bookmarklet - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet
[02:24:18] <chris245> To select a span, I did span.click(function(){ $('#canvas .selected').removeClass('selected'); $(this).addClass('selected'); });
[02:24:59] <chris245> The problem is that a parent span's click event is called causing selection to move a step up.
[02:25:02] <theBrettman> oh, that's easy
[02:25:14] <chris245> To fix, I add event.stopPropagation() to my above code.
[02:25:15] <theBrettman> I guess I could do that on chrome...
[02:25:27] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[02:25:41] <aaronmcadam> ?tiac @ theBrettman

[02:25:46] <bot-t> theBrettman, Try It And See
[02:25:46] <chris245> It kind of worked for my #canvas div, but not the parent span
[02:26:31] <Me-Selfe> chris245: "kind of worked" is very vague to describe what happends..
[02:27:32] <theBrettman> um, it didn't work...
[02:29:07] <aljosa> if i have $("select") how can i remove all option items in this select?
[02:29:22] <theBrettman> oh, didn't make the bookmarklet right. it won't accept multiline
[02:30:17] <aaronmcadam> u can drag it to the address bar
[02:30:34] <aaronmcadam> aljosa, try $("select").children()
[02:30:44] <theBrettman> oh, that wasn't it either. it was the page I pasted from. I was only getting javascript: cuz they had the rest of the code in something else. that's dumb
[02:31:16] <aaronmcadam> theBrettman, use this one http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/04/better-stronger-safer-jquerify-bookmarklet
[02:32:23] <theBrettman> damn, that thing is huge! lol
[02:33:22] <solsTiCe> hi. I don't know where to ask. I try here. I made a infinite scrolling page. ie. when at the bottom it asks via ajax 15 new data to show on a table. and on and on. the problem is if i go to a page and switch back the original page is reset and all the downloaded ajax is gone. how do I do so that the downloaded ajax is still displayed on the page ? that the modified page is cached
[02:33:24] <aaronmcadam> not really
[02:33:59] <theBrettman> it doesn't look like it's inserting the script into the page
[02:34:11] <aaronmcadam> open console and type $.fn
[02:35:27] <aaronmcadam> or $.get or any func
[02:37:10] <theBrettman> undefined
[02:38:01] <theBrettman> and yes, I put javascript: before the massive amount of code I had to paste for the url of the booklet
[02:38:11] <theBrettman> *bookmarklet
[02:38:22] <toxz> i add and remove options from a select element via jquery. but in the pop-up layer with the options to choose has crazy behaviour in the height in chrome!? any experiences in that?
[02:38:47] <theBrettman> shouldn't it work though if I just insert the script into the page?
[02:43:56] <jvdl0> Hey togther. Can me anyone help by jquery UI animated dialog? PN pls :)
[02:47:05] <Anticom> hi all
[02:47:23] <muzone> With jQuery / jQuery UI - how do I do a simple image slider like on http://www.tobi.com/?
[02:47:33] <Anticom> how can i select all input fields with type text inside a specific table?
[02:48:25] <jvdl0> $( "input:type=[text]" )
[02:48:26] <jvdl0> ?
[02:49:33] <muzone> jvdl0: no, IMAGE SLIDER
[02:49:42] <muzone> oh that was for Anticom
[02:50:15] <Anticom> muzone: and that only inside a table with id "filters"
[02:50:51] <Anticom> '#filters input:type=[text]' ??
[02:52:03] <jvdl0> look here: http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/04/select-text-in-input-box-on-user-select.html
[02:52:04] <keirlav> anyone used the google adwords api javascript lib?
[02:52:19] <jvdl0> @Anticom :)
[02:53:13] <muzone> How do I do a simple image slider like on http://www.tobi.com/?
[02:54:30] <keirlav> muzone: would you like a plugin ro to do it yourself?
[02:55:51] <anavel> any other way to assign value beside using attr() ?
[02:56:25] <equivoc> anavel: $('#id')[0].value
[02:56:40] <equivoc> .val('value')
[02:56:46] <equivoc> .val('...')
[02:56:54] <equivoc> that's the way to go
[02:57:13] <equivoc> .val('...') << setter, .val() << getter
[02:58:13] <anavel> thanks
[02:58:24] <anavel> i forgot the .val('xxx') :|
[02:58:44] <equivoc> same here, for a second ;)
[02:59:11] <jvdl0> @muzone, maybe this help? http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#side-scroll
[02:59:41] <muzone> keirlav: Whatever works best
[03:00:15] <muzone> jvdl0: I'm gonna need something more specific than that :-(
[03:01:50] <jvdl0> @muzone: here is sample code and docu. same one like tobi: http://sixrevisions.com/tutorials/javascript_tutorial/create-a-slick-and-accessible-slideshow-using-jquery/
[03:02:12] <jvdl0> demonstration: http://sixrevisions.com/demo/slideshow/final.html
[03:02:56] <wangdoo> How do i lock scroll using jquery till document loads in page?
[03:03:11] <okaycool> I am using the jQuery Cycle slider plugin. Pretty straight forward. Now how do I replace the 1 2 3 4 5 decimal numbers with roman I II III IV V etc in the pager?
[03:05:22] <muzone> thanks a lot jvdl0
[03:05:59] <jvdl0> no problem :)
[03:08:00] <aaronmcadam> t
[03:08:21] <Aamir> okaycool:  try ol { list-style-type: upper-roman; }
[03:08:31] <wangdoo> okaycool: How do i lock scroll using jquery till document loads in page?
[03:08:52] <okaycool> Aamir: nope, they just come in <a> tags :(
[03:09:20] <Aamir> okaycool:  thats so wrong - try using .replace than :|
[03:09:32] <okaycool> i think so
[03:09:33] <okaycool> yes
[03:10:56] <aaronmcadam> okaycool, http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/options.html you're looking for pagerAnchorBuilder
[03:11:48] <aaronmcadam> i would use an obj literal of { 1 : 'I', 2 : 'II' ... }
[03:12:23] <aaronmcadam> and then do '<a>' + obj.index + '</a>' to get the right value
[03:12:24] <okaycool> i see. not sure my jquery is that good, but thanks, let me try to understand
[03:12:41] <aaronmcadam> pagerAnchorBuilder: null, // callback fn for building anchor links:  function(index, DOMelement)
[03:12:56] <aaronmcadam> if your JavaScript is any good u should be fine :p
[03:13:00] <okaycool> :P
[03:13:09] <aaronmcadam> it's a new jQuery plugin
[03:13:12] <okaycool> time to get better
[03:13:22] <aaronmcadam> $.JavaScript
[03:13:24] <aaronmcadam> it's amazing
[03:13:43] <okaycool> he he
[03:13:45] <aaronmcadam> :p
[03:13:57] <okaycool> had me for a while
[03:13:59] <aaronmcadam> also, the add plugin is good
[03:14:12] <aaronmcadam> $.add( 1, 2 )
[03:14:17] <aaronmcadam> returns 3! :o
[03:14:23] <okaycool> woah!
[03:14:42] <okaycool> is that a premium plugin? :P
[03:14:47] <aaronmcadam> no way
[03:15:13] <aaronmcadam> anyway
[03:15:17] <okaycool> :D
[03:15:21] <aaronmcadam> you follow what i'm talking bout
[03:15:34] <okaycool> yes a bit, still reading
[03:16:07] <blaze_boy> i'm creating jquery UI tabs that act the tabs act as links but it loads the tabs with ajax, i tried http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs but it only prevent when selecting the tabs, i want to prevent even the first selected tab from loading as i already got it's content.
[03:16:22] <aaronmcadam> okaycool, http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/pager2.html
[03:16:33] <aaronmcadam> an example of using the optional function
[03:16:36] <okaycool> i see!
[03:16:42] <okaycool> thats what i wasnt sure of
[03:16:48] <okaycool> how to use a function
[03:17:03] <aaronmcadam> so before the return, do var romanNumerals = { 1 : 'I' ... }
[03:17:34] <aaronmcadam> and instead of '<img...' do romanNumerals.idx
[03:17:56] <aaronmcadam> should work
[03:18:39] <aaronmcadam> there might be a number format plugin but it'd probably have to hardcode anyway
[03:18:55] <aaronmcadam> other option would be to just return an <ol> element
[03:19:01] <aaronmcadam> and set the css as roman numeral
[03:19:31] <aaronmcadam> $('#slideshow').before('<ol id="nav">').cycle({
[03:19:53] <aaronmcadam> but that might cause some problems
[03:20:04] <aaronmcadam> best to hardcode the numerals in an array I think
[03:20:14] <aaronmcadam> unless you need it to be dynamic?
[03:20:26] <aaronmcadam> could it scale beyond 20 or so?
[03:20:46] <okaycool> hmm...
[03:20:57] <okaycool> sorry I have a small brain :) taking time
[03:21:30] <aaronmcadam> i'm saying, it's probably best to add all the numbers you need
[03:21:57] <aaronmcadam> in that object literal
[03:22:34] <khaan> hi everybody, is there anyone familiar with jquery quicksand plugin please? :)
[03:22:39] <aaronmcadam> lemme fiddle it to see
[03:24:52] <okaycool> aaronmcadam: is this right? var romanNumerals = {1: 'I', 2: 'II', 3:'III', 4:'IV'}; i mean syntax wise
[03:25:41] <aaronmcadam> yea here http://jsfiddle.net/
[03:25:43] <dvgsvc> anyone knows the answer to this?http://forum.jquery.com/topic/multiple-item-selection
[03:25:53] <aaronmcadam> haha hang on
[03:25:56] <okaycool> :P
[03:25:58] <aaronmcadam> okaycool, http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/pRSe9/
[03:26:38] <aaronmcadam> okaycool http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/pRSe9/1/
[03:26:58] <okaycool> I see
[03:27:20] <aaronmcadam> so if you return romans[idx] following that function example on the cycle site
[03:27:47] <Boozeniges> okaycool: why can't you use CSS? li { list-style-type: lower-roman; }?
[03:28:11] <aaronmcadam> because it doesn't work like that Boozeniges
[03:28:16] <okaycool> Boozeniges: i am getting output in <a> tags, and they have to be center aligned, inline :(
[03:28:26] <Boozeniges> urgh
[03:28:34] <okaycool> if i have them in ol/ul and float, can't really center
[03:28:34] <aaronmcadam> it's sorted now anyway
[03:28:40] <Boozeniges> that sounds nasty :-P
[03:28:40] <okaycool> bulshit design sorta :P
[03:28:44] <okaycool> yep
[03:28:51] <aaronmcadam> it's better to have them as actual links anyway
[03:28:58] <okaycool> oh yes
[03:29:01] <aaronmcadam> they are anchors, after all
[03:29:11] <okaycool> what gives i don't know, 1 2 3 is just fine i guess
[03:29:19] <okaycool> but they want it as romans
[03:29:26] <aaronmcadam> it's not a big deal anyway
[03:29:29] <okaycool> nah
[03:29:32] <aaronmcadam> a simple callback function
[03:29:35] <okaycool> i am just a jquery noob
[03:29:46] <aaronmcadam> well you learn by customising plugins
[03:30:11] <okaycool> hmmm
[03:30:39] <blaze_boy> anyone knows how to disable ajax loading of the default select tabs after page loads ?
[03:30:54] <aaronmcadam> wtF?
[03:32:09] <khaan> hey everybody
[03:32:27] <keirlav> hey khaan
[03:32:55] <khaan> i have a link like <a class="colorbox-content-link" href="<?php the_permalink() ?> #content" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to <?php the_title(); ?>"
[03:33:05] <khaan> and a jquery function
[03:33:13] <khaan> this should grab the content from the whole page
[03:33:32] <khaan> and it's just loading the whole page pointing directly to the #content div
[03:33:41] <khaan> can i pastebin the function so you can help me?
[03:33:42] <khaan> :)
[03:34:18] <khaan> this is the actual function: http://pastebin.com/43j0Y1ua
[03:35:32] <krz> how would i wrap $('ul') with div #foo ?
[03:35:50] <krz> so it becomes <div id="foo"><ul>
[03:35:50] <okaycool> thanks aaronmcadam got it working
[03:35:56] <aaronmcadam> cool
[03:36:06] <aaronmcadam> did u do it the way i said?
[03:36:10] <okaycool> note: as jquery cycle counts index zero based
[03:36:15] <krz> wrap?
[03:36:19] <okaycool> yes
[03:36:24] <aaronmcadam> cool
[03:36:40] <aaronmcadam> it shouldn't make a difference
[03:36:50] <okaycool> so i did 0: 'I' , 1: 'II' likewise
[03:36:51] <aaronmcadam> if it's zero based, it should still go through it properly
[03:36:55] <aaronmcadam> ah yeah
[03:36:56] <aaronmcadam> cool
[03:37:04] <okaycool> it was showing undefined for the first one otherwise
[03:37:09] <aaronmcadam> aye
[03:37:18] <aaronmcadam> if u were to just use a flat array it would have worked
[03:37:35] <okaycool> http://pastebin.com/Ht65q6dk
[03:37:42] <aaronmcadam> but it's best to use an obj literal in this case because it might not be obvious what the numerals map to
[03:37:51] <aaronmcadam> when u come back to it later
[03:38:07] <okaycool> what is an object literal
[03:38:08] <aaronmcadam> much easier to add 25 : ...
[03:38:15] <aaronmcadam> umm
[03:38:28] <aaronmcadam> just defining and object in line
[03:38:32] <aaronmcadam> rather than new Object...
[03:38:38] <coldhead> good to see you're doing a bang up job as usual, aaronmcadam
[03:38:42] <aaronmcadam> you should always use literal notation
[03:39:00] <aaronmcadam> ye gotta always think of maintainability
[03:39:09] <aaronmcadam> cheers coldhead :P
[03:39:10] <okaycool> what i have there, the 1: 'I', 2: 'II' is that an example of object literal or flat array?
[03:39:16] <juha___> coldhead, you sir, are awesome
[03:39:24] <aaronmcadam> that's an obj literal
[03:39:28] <okaycool> i see
[03:39:39] <coldhead> this is awesome: http://miketaylr.com/post/51fe06df.png
[03:39:59] <aaronmcadam> juha___, i heard rumours you're good on jqmobile?
[03:40:10] <dabear> on the serverside using jsonp..
[03:40:15] <okaycool> but then if this list becomes long its a hassle to add more right? then in that case what would you do aaronmcadam ?
[03:40:17] <krz> $('ul').wrap('<div id="foo"></div>'); how can i delete foo afterwards, without removing the child elements?
[03:40:27] <dabear> how should I validate the callback parameter from the ajax request?
[03:40:28] <krz> i.e. without remove ul and all its children
[03:40:28] <aaronmcadam> okay, change that
[03:40:31] <aaronmcadam> do idx + 1
[03:40:33] <okaycool> like when you cant predict how many numbers will be there
[03:40:37] <aaronmcadam> oh wait hang
[03:40:37] <okaycool> i see
[03:40:41] <okaycool> okay
[03:40:49] <juha___> aaronmcadam: it's pretty simple, i haven't used it for a while, so i'm not fully at speed with the latest versions
[03:40:54] <aaronmcadam> yeah I know that's where the solution falls down, i did say that okaycool
[03:41:07] <coldhead> don't be modest, juha___
[03:41:07] <okaycool> oh
[03:41:11] <okaycool> reading up
[03:41:26] <aaronmcadam> juha___, just having a bit of trouble with programmatically doing things
[03:41:36] <aaronmcadam> like adding dynamic content and making sure it's always styled
[03:41:53] <aaronmcadam> and calling a dialog. I had to do an ugly attach a link to it and trigger a click
[03:42:03] <krz> anyone?
[03:42:32] <aaronmcadam> okaycool, change the romanNumerals back to { 1 : 'I' .. }
[03:42:39] <aaronmcadam> and do idx+1
[03:42:47] <aaronmcadam> so you can read it better
[03:42:48] <coldhead> aaronmcadam: there is some function i forget the name of that will style dynamically loaded content for you
[03:42:55] <okaycool> aaronmcadam: ah i see
[03:43:08] <aaronmcadam> yeah there's a refresh func I remember somewhere
[03:43:09] <coldhead> it makes me squeamish that you have to do it manually but there is such a thing
[03:43:15] <juha___> aaronmcadam: $("div").dialog("open"); ?
[03:43:18] <aaronmcadam> ha nope
[03:43:23] <aaronmcadam> open isn't supported :S
[03:43:31] <coldhead> >: |
[03:43:32] <okaycool> aaronmcadam: didn't understand the part where you said the other/better way of doing it for maintanability
[03:43:42] <aaronmcadam> when i inspect the dialog object, it doesn't have that method, only close
[03:43:53] <aaronmcadam> well think about it okaycool
[03:43:53] <okaycool> mind explaining a bit again :)
[03:44:05] <aaronmcadam> does it make sense to you to have 5 : 'VI'
[03:44:08] <okaycool> if we have a way to show the funciton a way
[03:44:15] <okaycool> to map further numbers
[03:44:23] <okaycool> aaronmcadam: nope, got that part
[03:44:23] <aaronmcadam> you're gonna have to just hardcode em
[03:44:26] <okaycool> will do idx + 1
[03:44:27] <aaronmcadam> unless as i said,
[03:44:35] <aaronmcadam> you can find a format plugin
[03:44:38] <tbuehlmann> greetings! any recommendation for a jQuery plugin for form validation?
[03:44:41] <okaycool> ah i see
[03:44:47] <aaronmcadam> but i'm sure that would just hardcode the values too
[03:45:02] <okaycool> :P
[03:45:23] <okaycool> in my case i know for sure that there won't be more than 10 images per slide though so safe :)
[03:45:45] <gnarf> ?validate
[03:45:46] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[03:45:46] <bot-t> gnarf, Plugins/Validation/validate - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate
[03:46:19] <aaronmcadam> coldhead, can u remember what the call was to refresh?
[03:46:29] <aaronmcadam> it seems that the plugins have their own refresh functions
[03:46:43] <the_intel> Hello.
[03:46:50] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: for what?
[03:47:07] <the_intel> what is purpose of jquery?
[03:47:43] <gnarf> "jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. jQuery is designed to change the way that you write JavaScript."
[03:47:47] <okaycool> it helps me to make a bit of money? :P
[03:47:47] <gnarf> from the home page
[03:47:55] <aaronmcadam> gnarf, checkboxradio
[03:47:56] <coldhead> no idea, aaronmcadam. and if it wasn't juha___ who mentioned it to me it's wookiehangover
[03:48:05] <coldhead> you know who knows most stuff is gnarf, ask him
[03:48:09] <coldhead> him or her
[03:48:11] <coldhead> :D
[03:48:15] <gnarf> ;)
[03:48:16] <the_intel> gnarf, Don't you think I read that?
[03:48:25] <gnarf> the_intel: nope
[03:48:26] <the_intel> I really didn't get the meaning though
[03:48:29] <coldhead> mind your manners, the_intel
[03:48:32] <coldhead> :D
[03:48:57] <gnarf> the_intel: you're asking arbitrary questions in #jquery -- Means you probably didn't read anything yet.
[03:49:06] <the_intel> Oh , Gentlemens I am really sorry , I apologize
[03:49:10] <the_intel> ..
[03:49:24] <gnarf> the_intel: if you have a more specific question, ask it
[03:49:32] <aaronmcadam> gnarf, just having problems refreshing the style on appended data
[03:49:37] <coldhead> my sarcasm senses are tingling
[03:49:44] <the_intel> gnarf, you get specific questions when you start doing something
[03:49:56] <aaronmcadam> gnarf, maybe not the best idea to replace content with html() do u think?
[03:50:02] <juha___> aaronmcadam: refresh?
[03:50:04] <krz> anyone?
[03:50:08] <juha___> aaronmcadam: refreshing what?
[03:50:09] <krz> $('ul').wrap('<div id="foo"></div>'); how can i delete foo afterwards, without removing the child elements?
[03:50:15] <gnarf> ?newContent @aaronmcadam
[03:50:15] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[03:50:16] <aaronmcadam> juha___, the styling
[03:50:16] <krz> i.e. without remove ul and all its children
[03:50:18] <coldhead> mountain dew
[03:50:20] <coldhead> is refreshing
[03:50:24] <juha___> :D
[03:50:28] <coldhead> so is crab juice
[03:50:36] <juha___> aaronmcadam: you can remove the style element and add new back for example?
[03:50:41] <juha___> oh eaait
[03:50:48] <aaronmcadam> got a feeling that's not the way jqmobile will work
[03:50:50] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: i assume your "styling" is added by a stateful plugin like a widget?
[03:50:51] <aaronmcadam> nope
[03:50:52] <juha___> i know what you meaning, just need REFRESH my memory ->
[03:51:12] <juha___> aaronmcadam: are you using the latest jquery mobile AND latest jquery ?
[03:51:16] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: most widgets in ui have a "refresh" method
[03:51:16] <aaronmcadam> it's checkboxradio
[03:51:29] <aaronmcadam> juha___, do you think I'm a noob :P
[03:51:31] <gnarf> that you call when the base dom is changed
[03:51:37] <juha___> aaronmcadam: naturally
[03:51:55] <gnarf> he's one of 10 names in #jquerymobile-dev ;)
[03:51:56] <aaronmcadam> yeah refersh doesn't call, maybe I should check whether checkbox is already set first
[03:52:04] <aaronmcadam> haha
[03:52:13] <aaronmcadam> yeah i'm lookin to help with the docs
[03:52:15] <gnarf> yeah aaronmcadam, wish I had more time to dig in on mobile
[03:52:20] <aaronmcadam> once I figure it out!
[03:52:25] <gnarf> :)
[03:52:31] <gnarf> source?
[03:52:44] <aaronmcadam> yeah it /is/ handy enough, but it's docs that are failing
[03:52:55] <aaronmcadam> when you want to do programmatic stuff
[03:53:05] <aaronmcadam> rather than letting the framework generate stuff from html

[03:54:08] <gnarf> nice find juha___
[03:55:08] <aaronmcadam> thanks dude
[03:55:24] <gnarf> hrm
[03:55:25] <aaronmcadam> what I'm trying first is checking if the checkboxradio plugin has been attached to the content
[03:55:31] <aaronmcadam> else refresh it
[03:55:54] <aaronmcadam> was having an error where it was trying to refresh without initialising
[04:02:01] <sean`> i
[04:02:27] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[04:02:37] <aaronmcadam> that question's answers aren't great
[04:03:39] <aaronmcadam> gnarf, juha___ http://www.pastie.org/2171757
[04:03:52] <gnarf> that is on a branch
[04:04:04] <aaronmcadam> i'm using .latest
[04:04:09] <aaronmcadam> thing is
[04:04:09] <gnarf> its on a BRANCH
[04:04:15] <gnarf> not master :)
[04:04:17] <aaronmcadam> calm down
[04:04:20] <aaronmcadam> jesus haha
[04:04:29] <aaronmcadam> I'm just on it to see
[04:04:31] <aaronmcadam> anyway
[04:04:31] <gnarf> .latest is git master
[04:04:34] <aaronmcadam> the first time
[04:04:45] <Freddi> how do you do a IF statment testing a secondary value in a array ?
[04:04:47] <aaronmcadam> it styles fine
[04:05:00] <aaronmcadam> it's just if I reload the content
[04:05:02] <gnarf> Freddi: huh?
[04:05:24] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: are you destroying the outer element?
[04:05:33] <gnarf> rather
[04:05:43] <gnarf> #addressList - is it "new"
[04:06:02] <gnarf> or is it the inner content that needs styling?
[04:07:03] <aaronmcadam> nope
[04:07:04] <gnarf> because there is a good chance you're trying to "enchance" something that is already enhanced
[04:07:12] <aaronmcadam> oh wait
[04:07:30] <gnarf> what happens if you replace #addressList too?
[04:07:36] <Freddi> gnarft, i have an array with several sets of values that need to be testes simoultaniously to affect a change
[04:07:40] <aaronmcadam> lemme try
[04:07:50] <gnarf> Freddi: see ?p
[04:07:50] <bot-t> Freddi, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:08:04] <gnarf> also see ?ask
[04:08:05] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:08:12] <Freddi> yeah, i would paste the code if i knew what the code was :P
[04:08:13] <gnarf> the link is useful
[04:08:22] <gnarf> Freddi: show me the array
[04:08:27] <gnarf> Freddi: show me something
[04:08:32] <gnarf> Freddi: an empty if()
[04:08:40] <gnarf> explaining what you need to check
[04:08:41] <gnarf> in detail
[04:08:54] <gnarf> because you're asking for something that you can't even put into english right now ;)
[04:09:15] <aaronmcadam> addressList is just the containing div gnarf, it doesn't get any classes added to it by jqm
[04:09:26] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: just a thought
[04:09:31] <aaronmcadam> yep thanks man
[04:09:38] <aaronmcadam> any ideas at all are welcome
[04:09:54] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: any chance you have a fiddle of it yet?
[04:10:03] <aaronmcadam> well the thing is
[04:10:13] <aaronmcadam> it's making an api call to a licensed db
[04:10:26] <aaronmcadam> but yeah I'll whack together an array to use as dummy data
[04:10:30] <gnarf> can't you fake the response?
[04:10:47] <aaronmcadam> I'll sort something out now :)
[04:11:18] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: when you get done fiddling, you might want to paste a well worded stackoverflow question on it :)
[04:13:10] <Freddi> gnarf, var foo [ {url: "foo1.com", "item1"}, {url: "foo2.com", "item2" } ]; i would like to test to see if the values in the indevidudual arrays match :)
[04:13:25] <gnarf> Freddi: a) thats not valid JSON
[04:13:32] <gnarf> ?jsonlint
[04:13:33] <Freddi> and then affect a change based on the result, i'm usure about how to write the test
[04:13:33] <bot-t> JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[04:13:37] <gnarf> but
[04:13:40] <gnarf> either way
[04:13:42] <gnarf> its not valid JS
[04:14:12] <gnarf> ?js var foo = [ {url: "foo1.com", "item1"}, {url: "foo2.com", "item2" } ]
[04:14:14] <bot-t> gnarf: SyntaxError: invalid object initializer
[04:14:35] <gnarf> ?js var foo = [ {url: "foo1.com", someKey: "item1"}, {url: "foo2.com", someKey: "item2" } ]
[04:14:35] <bot-t> gnarf: undefined
[04:14:40] <gnarf> ?js var foo = [ {url: "foo1.com", someKey: "item1"}, {url: "foo2.com", someKey: "item2" } ]; foo[1]
[04:14:41] <bot-t> gnarf: {"url": "foo2.com", "someKey": "item2"}
[04:14:48] <gnarf> ?js var foo = [ {url: "foo1.com", someKey: "item1"}, {url: "foo2.com", someKey: "item2" } ]; foo[1].url;
[04:14:49] <bot-t> gnarf: "foo2.com"
[04:15:27] <gnarf> any of that make sense Freddi? ^^^^
[04:16:04] <aaronmcadam> ?js JSON.stringify( { a : 'b' } );
[04:16:05] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: "{\"a\":\"b\"}"
[04:17:00] <gnarf> ?js print "boo\"";
[04:17:01] <bot-t> gnarf: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[04:17:08] <gnarf> ?js print("boo\"");
[04:17:09] <bot-t> gnarf: "boo\""
[04:17:13] <gnarf> darn
[04:17:22] <gnarf> was hoping print might avoid escaping the quotes
[04:17:36] <gnarf> ?js {a: "b"}
[04:17:37] <bot-t> gnarf: "b"
[04:17:44] <gnarf> ?js a={a: "b"};
[04:17:45] <bot-t> gnarf: {"a": "b"}
[04:18:08] <deliya> is there any basic books about building CMS with jquery?
[04:18:44] <aaronmcadam> ah gnarf!
[04:18:47] <aaronmcadam> think i got it dude!
[04:19:05] <aaronmcadam> I was trying to call the plugin on the parent and not the children inputs
[04:19:11] <aaronmcadam> yep deliya
[04:19:15] <aaronmcadam> can recommend my friend's book
[04:19:30] <deliya> go ahead
[04:19:38] <aaronmcadam> deliya, http://www.webhostdesignpost.com/website/cmsdesignusingphpandjqueryreview.html
[04:20:56] <deliya> aaronmcadam, thanks i'll see
[04:21:13] <aaronmcadam> it's quite good
[04:21:25] <aaronmcadam> the guy's not a designer so don't expect loads of really cool looking stuff
[04:21:31] <aaronmcadam> it's more functional
[04:21:42] <aaronmcadam> and talks about structuring a CMS too
[04:23:54] <aaronmcadam> yep that was it gnarf
[04:24:00] <aaronmcadam> goddammit :D
[04:24:18] <aaronmcadam> chooseAddress.find('#addressList').html( list ).children().checkboxradio();
[04:24:18] <deliya> aaronmcadam, thanks for your suggest book :)
[04:24:25] <aaronmcadam> no prob deliya
[04:24:35] <aaronmcadam> what languages you using?
[04:24:42] <aaronmcadam> PHP/MySQL?
[04:25:10] <gnarf> SQL is dead to me
[04:25:11] <gnarf> ;)
[04:25:13] <deliya> yup
[04:25:14] <aaronmcadam> haha
[04:25:17] <aaronmcadam> nosql ftw?
[04:25:20] <gnarf> yeah
[04:25:25] <aaronmcadam> redis/couch/mongo?
[04:25:28] <gnarf> mongo
[04:25:30] <aaronmcadam> cool
[04:25:39] <aaronmcadam> I used couch for my final uni project
[04:25:42] <gnarf> its positively awesome
[04:25:58] <aaronmcadam> looked at mongo tutorials, looks great, a lot more sane than couch, query wise
[04:26:08] <deliya> i use MySQL as database since 2008
[04:26:09] <aaronmcadam> couch is allll map/reduce
[04:26:28] <aaronmcadam> dunno they might have helper functions now, but christ it was hard to figure out
[04:26:37] <gnarf> deliya: i've been using MySQL since 2000
[04:26:51] <gnarf> deliya: done with it ;)
[04:27:02] <aaronmcadam> it depends what you want
[04:27:19] <aaronmcadam> mongo can guarantee ACIDity right gnarf?
[04:27:46] <deliya> gnarf, wow. actually i'm not web programmer.
[04:27:52] <aaronmcadam> can it be fully transactional?
[04:28:06] <aaronmcadam> what sort of programmer then?
[04:28:11] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: there is no "transaction" each query runs its own
[04:28:18] <aaronmcadam> ?g ostrich programming @ deliya
[04:28:18] <gnarf> but the queries are atomic
[04:28:29] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[04:28:45] <bot-t> deliya, Ostrich (person) - WikiFur, the furry encyclopedia - http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Ostrich_(person)
[04:28:46] <juha___> MONGO!
[04:28:48] <aaronmcadam> it's just for our system we need transactions to make sure data is written in sequence
[04:28:49] <gnarf> i haven't really tackled shards yet, but the docs make it seem really transparent
[04:29:03] <juha___> i've switched from mysql to mongo on my own projects, it's awesome
[04:29:05] <aaronmcadam> i like the way it's scalable out of the box
[04:29:22] <gnarf> schemaless database in general is just powerful
[04:29:26] <juha___> yes
[04:29:32] <juha___> fast to develop, fast to use
[04:29:33] <deliya> i'm just use programming to solve physics or science problem
[04:29:35] <aaronmcadam> the system I work with, we deal with a db of ~500 million rows
[04:29:47] <aaronmcadam> and constantly growing
[04:29:55] <aaronmcadam> and that's just one db
[04:29:55] <juha___> system i'm working on with mongo, has about 14 rows
[04:29:59] <juha___> which is cool
[04:30:07] <aaronmcadam> 14m?
[04:30:48] <juha___> no
[04:30:49] <juha___> 14
[04:30:52] <aaronmcadam> lol
[04:30:56] <juha___> super fast
[04:31:00] <aaronmcadam> hah of course
[04:31:05] <aaronmcadam> if it's only bloody 14 rows
[04:31:22] <juha___> let me assure you, those rows are not bloody
[04:31:52] <aaronmcadam> we were talking about maybe using mongo as some sort of replication to take the load of mysql
[04:31:57] <aaronmcadam> off*
[04:32:12] <coldhead> i <3 you guys
[04:32:53] <juha___> in my own personal project, my biggest collection is 175k rows.. but it's only one week (release week) so it'll grow
[04:33:03] <coldhead> BUT I HAVE CHOSEN DARKNESS
[04:33:09] <deliya> guys, i gonna build web that have 20,000 accounts. can i put them all in 1 table? or i split them?
[04:33:09] <aaronmcadam> love u too coldhead
[04:33:15] <juha___> but i love how mongo is really fast to develop with and how it's runned on the memory and such
[04:33:24] <juha___> coldhead is such a cutie
[04:33:32] <aaronmcadam> deliya, that should be fine
[04:33:33] <coldhead> where are you on the planet, aaronmcadam?
[04:33:51] <aaronmcadam> deliya, only makes sense to split tables if you're going above 1m
[04:34:11] <aaronmcadam> england coldhead, i'm from ireland tho
[04:34:12] <deliya> what do you mean 1m?
[04:34:15] <aaronmcadam> 1 million
[04:34:19] <seutje> coldhead: we <3 you too!
[04:34:22] <deliya> oohh,
[04:34:30] <aaronmcadam> deliya, mysql will cope with a measly 20k :P
[04:35:07] <aaronmcadam> we really need a solution to our data issues tho
[04:35:40] <aaronmcadam> we work with code generation, we need a way to only store a reference to a batch of codes and not each actual code's encryption
[04:35:45] <krz> aaronmcadam: how much money are you guys making with that many rows?
[04:35:47] <aaronmcadam> anyone's ideas are very welcome
[04:36:00] <aaronmcadam> enough :P
[04:36:05] <juha___> $5 a day!
[04:36:29] <krz> aaronmcadam: can we see the app?
[04:36:44] <aaronmcadam> haha it's a loyalty platform,
[04:37:16] <aaronmcadam> https://uk.mcvitiesvipclub.co.uk/ is one example
[04:37:33] <aaronmcadam> the code needs lots of rewriting but that's why i was hired :D
[04:37:59] <juha___> what language are you using?
[04:38:26] <VictorCL2> hi :)
[04:38:29] <aaronmcadam> python, django
[04:38:39] <juha___> ok cool
[04:38:42] <aaronmcadam> still learning bits n pieces
[04:38:49] <aaronmcadam> my focus is js tho
[04:38:57] <juha___> my focus is boobs
[04:39:00] <aaronmcadam> nice
[04:39:04] <aaronmcadam> i like my girlfriends :D
[04:39:14] <juha___> me too
[04:39:16] <aaronmcadam> haha
[04:39:25] <aaronmcadam> high five to u sir
[04:39:42] <aaronmcadam> any ideas on encryption or generation techniques
[04:39:51] <VictorCL2> I have this problem .. not much related to jquery .. but maybe anyone can help me  ....  on my terminal I do  for example :   GET http://www.mysite.com/index.php?name=myname&lastname=mylastname  ... then on index.php I do print_r($_REQUEST);  ... and I only get the first GET ( username) .. on the array :(
[04:40:04] <aaronmcadam> basically we've got the possiblity of hitting over a billion by the end of the year
[04:40:15] <aaronmcadam> it can't be maintainable
[04:41:16] <aaronmcadam> VictorCL2, that's crazy, how are we sposed to answer that
[04:41:25] <aaronmcadam> without seeing your code
[04:41:43] <aaronmcadam> I know #php is always overflowing but really?
[04:43:48] <aaronmcadam> i love how people expect you to know the problem whilst giving you a black box
[04:44:29] <juha___> i really need to learn python :P
[04:44:42] <juha___> only thing ever done with python was something with google appspot
[04:45:05] <aaronmcadam> ah do man
[04:45:07] <aaronmcadam> it's sooo nice
[04:45:30] <aaronmcadam> before I used to have problems with using other php modules n stuff
[04:45:52] <aaronmcadam> and making it work properly with frameworks or a CMS
[04:46:16] <aaronmcadam> but with django or whatever u choose, you can use any module, e.g. a pdf generator, pretty damn easily
[04:46:23] <aaronmcadam> easyinstall or pip are awesome
[04:46:30] <aaronmcadam> same as rubygems really
[04:46:50] <aaronmcadam> plus it's actually been designed as an OO language, not like PHP's tacked on shit
[04:47:02] <juha___> yeah php is a bit of a mess
[04:47:07] <aaronmcadam> it's stupid
[04:47:13] <aaronmcadam> __autoload(); reallyyyy?
[04:47:16] <aaronmcadam> bullshit
[04:47:35] <aaronmcadam> all those super methods just to use classes properly
[04:47:46] <juha___> how's autoloading done in python?
[04:47:53] <aaronmcadam> good question
[04:47:57] <aaronmcadam> never actually looked
[04:48:27] <Me-Selfe> hm? Autoload? Its done by filenames?
[04:49:07] <Me-Selfe> erm, nvm
[04:50:07] <aaronmcadam> haha
[04:51:50] <MoTiOnXml> Me-Selfe: i'm back; meeting went perfect - phew! :)
[04:52:02] <MoTiOnXml> Me-Selfe: what did you change to make the draggable work in IE8? what was the bug?
[04:52:03] <VictorCL2> yes look
[04:52:03] <VictorCL2> http://pastebin.com/QKXmSQCu
[04:52:09] <aaronmcadam> it doesn't quite work the same way i think juha___
[04:52:24] <aaronmcadam> modules get compiled down to .egg files, kind of like .jar files in java
[04:52:50] <aaronmcadam> then code get's compiled down to .pyc files
[04:53:00] <Me-Selfe> MoTiOnXml: It was my fault, i used a protected name as variable :)
[04:53:11] <aaronmcadam> what name?
[04:53:13] <Me-Selfe> So, wasn't jquery's fault
[04:53:14] <aaronmcadam> class?
[04:53:22] <Me-Selfe> hehe, "body"
[04:53:24] <MoTiOnXml> Me-Selfe: ok
[04:53:45] <aaronmcadam> yeah js is full of protected words from other languages
[04:53:53] <aaronmcadam> class, static, etc etc
[04:54:01] <MoTiOnXml> :)
[04:54:13] <Me-Selfe> aaronmcadam: yes, kind of annoying with all the browsers tho, worked with "all" except ie8
[04:54:44] <Me-Selfe> The curse of web programming

[04:55:42] <Gorkyman> hey guys... I want to submit form to ajax call when I click an elemennt on that form... any suggestions?
[04:55:58] <aaronmcadam> nope
[04:56:00] <aaronmcadam> body isn't
[04:56:07] <Gorkyman> like when I select a checkbox a form would be posted to ajax call
[04:56:12] <rabab> when i refresh the page the jqueryworks fine
[04:56:13] <doncams> hey aaronmcadam, help... http://pastebin.com/yxUrTi9b , how do you get data from external json file and store it in a variable?
[04:56:27] <Me-Selfe> aaronmcadam: IE8 still complain :p
[04:56:36] <doncams> I've searched far and wide and I can't get an answer to what I am looking for :`(
[04:56:36] <aaronmcadam> must be vendor specific
[04:56:41] <aaronmcadam> one sec
[04:56:52] <Me-Selfe> i think i also had the problem that some Ie versions don't like element id's as variable i think
[04:57:13] <Me-Selfe> (Not sure of that tho, just a vague feeling i had that problem)
[04:57:31] <aaronmcadam> doncams
[04:57:35] <aaronmcadam> I'll put it on fiddle
[04:57:39] <doncams> yeah?
[04:57:41] <doncams> cool
[04:57:42] <aaronmcadam> what do u want?
[04:58:21] <aaronmcadam> data /is/ the json
[04:58:28] <doncams> yes
[04:58:39] <doncams> and I want it to be stored in var myjson
[04:59:01] <Me-Selfe> myjson = data
[04:59:01] <Me-Selfe> :)
[04:59:10] <doncams> that doesn't work also
[04:59:28] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[04:59:32] <doncams> shows myjson is undefined
[04:59:34] <aaronmcadam> are you sure you're getting at the json?
[04:59:38] <aaronmcadam> that's the right url?
[04:59:41] <doncams> yes
[04:59:43] <aaronmcadam> check in firebug
[04:59:44] <doncams> i get response
[04:59:54] <doncams> but myjson is still undefined
[05:00:26] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[05:00:40] <krz> $('#admin form').find('input[name="announcement[product_ids][]"]') returns: [input#announcement_product_ids_ 3, input#announcement_product_ids_ 5, input#announcement_product_ids_ 6] how can i return the one with the value of 3?
[05:00:42] <aaronmcadam> it's hard to say that code should work
[05:00:42] <Me-Selfe> can you write it like that?
[05:01:08] <Me-Selfe> getJSON is async, so that would return before you get the data..
[05:01:12] <aaronmcadam> ahhh
[05:01:14] <aaronmcadam> shir
[05:01:17] <doncams> yeah... that's the error
[05:01:24] <aaronmcadam> workin now?
[05:01:28] <doncams> nope
[05:01:32] <aaronmcadam> do var myjson outside of it
[05:01:37] <doncams> i mean that's the error. myjson is undefined
[05:01:41] <aaronmcadam> and set myjson = data;
[05:02:01] <krz> anyone?
[05:02:33] <MoTiOnXml> nice 2 #9471: memory leak noticed when loading jquey.1.6.1.min.js included html pages in the iframe

[05:03:18] <aaronmcadam> http://pastebin.com/zGSmTw2A ?
[05:03:40] <aaronmcadam> ah same
[05:04:02] <aaronmcadam> then thre's def somethign wrong
[05:04:17] <aaronmcadam> what happens if u just log out myjson
[05:04:33] <aaronmcadam> you need to parse it too u know
[05:04:39] <doncams> this doesn't work too http://pastebin.com/gi6EjQ2b
[05:04:40] <aaronmcadam> u can't just use it as is
[05:04:52] <aaronmcadam> ?parseJSON @ doncams
[05:04:52] <bot-t> doncams, jQuery.parseJSON(json): [New in v1.4.1] Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[05:05:08] <doncams> cool
[05:05:09] <krz> ok easier question. how do i return $('#admin form').find('input[value=3]') but for only for hidden inputs?
[05:05:19] <aaronmcadam> do myjson = $.parseJSON( data );
[05:06:21] <Me-Selfe> doncams: the problem is the same as i already said..
[05:06:23] <Me-Selfe> async..
[05:07:26] <stede> i cant use absolute paths in <script src..>?
[05:08:03] <aaronmcadam> you can pass async : false if need be
[05:08:50] <stede> instead of the alert i see "$ is not defined" in the error console. and the given jquery.js is readable as user www-data :-/
[05:09:09] <aaronmcadam> ...
[05:09:17] <doncams> shouldn't it work? :(
[05:09:27] <Me-Selfe> doncams: http://pastebin.com/XFxzj0s0
[05:09:47] <Me-Selfe> (just "proof of concept")
[05:10:11] <Me-Selfe> doncams: point is.. whatever you gonna do with the json file,you have to do after its loaded..
[05:10:39] <aaronmcadam> ?getJSON
[05:10:39] <bot-t> jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [callback]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[05:13:43] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[05:13:55] <aaronmcadam> seems the data already gets parsed, makes sese
[05:13:58] <aaronmcadam> sense
[05:14:33] <Me-Selfe> aaronmcadam: its why it's called getJSON
[05:14:40] <Me-Selfe> else you would just use get...
[05:15:10] <Me-Selfe> doncams: anyway, the setTimeout there is just stupid, but as i said, a proof of concept.. Whatever you use the data for should be called by the callback function
[05:15:13] <aaronmcadam> yes yse
[05:15:23] <aaronmcadam> i normally use the full ajax function
[05:15:36] <Me-Selfe> Im a sucker for shortcuts, i don't like typing :p
[05:15:52] <aaronmcadam> I usually want to set more options than one or 2
[05:16:59] <stede> why <script .. src="/mypath/jquery.js"> do not work?
[05:17:15] <aaronmcadam> it's also easier to work with the same function and just change options
[05:17:21] <MoTiOnXml> Me-Selfe: i can't still get the draggable to work with UI 1.8.14 for IE8 mode in IE9
[05:17:35] <aaronmcadam> rather than having to remember what reduced options can be passed to the shortcuts
[05:17:39] <MoTiOnXml> Me-Selfe: no events, nothing
[05:17:52] <Me-Selfe> MoTiOnXml: and no errors?
[05:17:59] <MoTiOnXml> nopes
[05:18:19] <doncams> i f*ckn give up. i'll just declare the whole thing with the variable instead of loading it externally
[05:18:26] <doncams> i'll figure it out later
[05:18:36] <doncams> gotta read more
[05:18:48] <Me-Selfe> doncams: you have exact code on how to do it? Why give up? :)
[05:18:50] <aaronmcadam> haha
[05:19:08] <doncams> it also doesn't work :)
[05:19:24] <Me-Selfe> doncams: if so, its your program logic thats wrong
[05:19:54] <doncams> that's the whole program for now... lol
[05:20:15] <MoTiOnXml> Me-Selfe: want a url to test?
[05:20:34] <MoTiOnXml> Me-Selfe: i'm doing $(document).draggable({..});
[05:20:40] <aaronmcadam> anyone remember what a checked checkbox's value is?
[05:20:44] <aaronmcadam> is it "yes"?
[05:21:08] <amcsi_work> is someContainer.find('#elementWithId') slower than $('#elementWithId')
[05:21:14] <aaronmcadam> yep
[05:21:15] <amcsi_work> I have a feeling that elements with id's are indexed, but only globally
[05:21:17] <doncams> this is actually the working code http://pastebin.com/0P8LP8zk
[05:21:18] <aaronmcadam> id's are always faster
[05:21:38] <Me-Selfe> MoTiOnXml: document.draggable?
[05:21:40] <doncams> I just want to separate the JSON part into another external file
[05:21:49] <Me-Selfe> doncams: http://pastebin.com/NiwuPVF5
[05:21:51] <Me-Selfe> that works..
[05:22:00] <aaronmcadam> ?g jsperf
[05:22:00] <keirlav> yes aaron ii think its yes :P
[05:22:01] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, jsPerf: JavaScript performance playground - http://jsperf.com/
[05:22:06] <Me-Selfe> MoTiOnXml: sure
[05:22:12] <aaronmcadam> give it a go in there i spsoe
[05:22:14] <aaronmcadam> spose*
[05:22:27] <MoTiOnXml> Me-Selfe: no, i have class selectors obviously; i'm doing $(document).draggable() to just find all instances on the entire page
[05:22:41] <Me-Selfe> MoTiOnXml: url?
[05:22:45] <MoTiOnXml> -> priv.
[05:23:29] <doncams> anyway, dinner time for me
[05:27:48] <m0dmd-> good day to everyone.
[05:28:25] <zn_> hello
[05:29:07] <zn_> why doesn't work $('textarea').val() ?
[05:29:17] <zn_> alert give me 'undefined'
[05:31:59] <aaronmcadam> $('textarea').text()?
[05:32:42] <aaronmcadam> it's 2011 and people are /still/ using alert for debugging...
[05:33:33] <zn_> hmm
[05:34:00] <zn_> what are you using for debugging?
[05:34:07] <aaronmcadam> firebug
[05:34:10] <nail_> users
[05:37:54] <xec> people on irc
[05:42:33] <Jon47> i use alert from time to time, i know I can set break points in firebug/chrome dev tools but sometimes just dropping an "alert" in there to halt the execution flow is all I need
[05:45:40] <MoTiOnXml> theBrettman: re this morning on IE8; please don't start bashing a browser just because somebody asks a question on a js error - think this is why the question was asked or the person cares?
[05:46:39] <JAAulde> I have an issue in IE7 with a UI Drag N Drop which works fine on first drag of any element, but a second drag of the same element crashes IE--dead--no error, just gone.
[05:46:57] <JAAulde> This does not happen IE8, even when in IE7 compat mode
[05:47:25] <JAAulde> there are other DnD interactions on the same page which work fine, just this one set of elements causes the crash
[05:48:10] <JAAulde> This is UI 1.8.13 - has anyone had this issue or seen it somewhere and knows something I can look in to?  I just can't figure out what is different
[05:48:16] <Me-Selfe> When js make the browser crash, you're allowed to diss it :)
[05:49:11] <mafoo_> anyone think they can help me with this minor issue with my logic
[05:49:19] <doncams> memory leak?
[05:49:25] <mafoo_> havent been to sleep so the code is starting to blur
[05:49:29] <doncams> my problem too
[05:50:16] <Aamir> mafoo_:  whats the issue?
[05:50:28] <mafoo_> lemme just get the code pasted
[05:51:03] <mafoo_> http://pastebin.com/Sfx3mjje
[05:51:10] <mafoo_> look under the my stuff bit
[05:51:40] <mafoo_> sometimes it toggles the activeDown/activeUp class chage
[05:51:49] <mafoo_> whithout resorting the elements
[05:52:40] <Aamir> ?demo @mafoo_
[05:52:41] <bot-t> mafoo_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:52:55] <mafoo_> ill pm you a link in a sec
[05:55:03] <Anticom> i've got a problem with unhiding an tr-element in a table http://jsfiddle.net/6LSsG/
[05:55:39] <Anticom> when clicking "edit" or "info" the corresponding tr-element should be shown, but somehow it won't
[05:56:07] <Anticom> i'm not so familiar with navigating in the DOM in jquery yet =/
[05:56:55] <fris> is their anyway to use the same function for 2 forms with the same id?
[05:57:53] <Me-Selfe> Anticom: you're like half and half jquery and javascript :)
[05:58:05] <Anticom> fris: afaik 2 html-elements NEVER should have the same id... for that purpose are classes
[05:58:43] <Anticom> Me-Selfe: where is the js part? i'm newbie to jq btw... maybe i'm not into that jq-workflow yet
[05:59:49] <aaronmcadam> there shouldn't be a divide between "jquery and js parts"
[06:00:26] <aaronmcadam> if something can be done without jquery, go for it
[06:01:51] <Freddi> Hello, is the iteration for a array differen if there is more then one value ? eg. var subNav = [{ url: "http://havornfotball.no/forside/klubben/organisasjonsinfo/", name: "klubben" }]; ? and
[06:01:52] <Anticom> aaronmcadam: but in my oppinion there is no non-jq in my fiddle ?!
[06:02:22] <Freddi> bit of a paradox really since you can't have jQuery with out JS
[06:02:46] <Anticom> Freddi: subNav[i].url should do the trick
[06:03:09] <Freddi> anakron, thank you and if i wanted to test to see if both values where present ?
[06:03:20] <aaronmcadam> Anticom, yeah, you're getting mixed up
[06:03:26] <aaronmcadam> $(this).parentNode().childNodes('.ticketDetail').show("slow");
[06:03:29] <aaronmcadam> you want
[06:03:42] <aaronmcadam> $(this).parent().children().find('.ticketDetail').show("slow");
[06:03:56] <fris> Anticom wordpress uses the same id searchform if you have multiple searchforms example the header and sidebar widget, the header uses a live search function i want to be able to do that via the sidebar widget search, but since they have the same id its not working correctly
[06:03:58] <Anticom> ah okay
[06:04:02] <aaronmcadam> u see?
[06:04:08] <Anticom> mixed up children and childNodes aaronmcadam
[06:04:13] <aaronmcadam> yip
[06:04:19] <aaronmcadam> easily done if you actually know js ;)
[06:04:39] <Trudko> guys how to change value with index 0 (or with value "select please")) to something else?
[06:05:30] <Anticom> aaronmcadam: doesn't work either =/
[06:05:36] <Anticom> http://188.40.73.22/dsmedia/timo/wip/dynamic.php
[06:06:31] <Anticom> aaronmcadam: could it be, that i need 2 .parent() methods?
[06:06:51] <Me-Selfe> yes, first is the cell
[06:06:54] <Anticom> because the button is nested in td and td in the tr, where the other tr is i want to find
[06:08:31] <Anticom> still doesn't work
[06:09:05] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ Anticom
[06:09:06] <bot-t> Anticom, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:09:16] <aaronmcadam> oh sorry aha
[06:09:27] <aaronmcadam> dunno dude i'm in the middle of somethin at mo
[06:10:21] <Anticom> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/6LSsG/10/
[06:10:49] <Me-Selfe> Anticom: the problem is that the hidden TR is not a child of the TR you get when doing parent().parent()
[06:11:07] <Anticom> Me-Selfe: and how can i fix that?
[06:11:18] <Trudko> guys how to change value with index 0 (or with value "select please")) to something else?
[06:11:20] <Anticom> unhide them per default and hide them on document ready with jq?
[06:11:22] <Anticom> would that work?
[06:11:37] <gesman> Hello
[06:11:45] <Aamir> Anticom:  try http://jsfiddle.net/6LSsG/11/
[06:11:55] <Me-Selfe> Anticom: well, you need to know which one to select..
[06:12:26] <Anticom> Aamir: in jsfiddle nothing is happening =/
[06:12:29] <gesman> Q: I have ssl page https://SITE.com/secure.php that issues non-secure AJAX call (via jQuery) to some other page. Is there any potential problems in doing that?
[06:12:57] <Aamir> Anticom:  try clickin info http://jsfiddle.net/6LSsG/12/
[06:13:42] <Aamir> and edit button
[06:14:05] <Anticom> Aamir: thanks (=
[06:14:17] <Aamir> no probs :)
[06:18:35] <zi> Can I make $.ajax with type: 'post' send my JSON as actual json? Because looks like it's sending just "type=test&data=123" URL encoded data.
[06:20:15] <seena> hi all
[06:21:11] <seena> i am using light box (THICKBOX) in my application, i need to reload a page once i close light box
[06:24:29] <Aamir> seena:  find the id/class of close button and in setTimeout try window.location.reload()
[06:25:01] <Aamir> seena: something like  closebutton.click(function(){ setTimeout(function(){ window.location.reload() },1000)  })
[06:30:48] <stenno_> good day, i have an <img> tag with a rel=3, is the correct jquery selector for that $("img[rel=3]") ?
[06:31:20] <Aamir> stenno_:  $("img['rel=3']")
[06:31:41] <stenno_> Aamir, thanks!
[06:31:48] <Aamir> stenno_:  no wait
[06:31:53] <Aamir> $("img[rel='3']")
[06:32:02] <stenno_> thanks again :)
[06:32:13] <Aamir> ?attribute equals selector @stenno_
[06:32:14] <bot-t> stenno_, Attribute Equals Selector [name="value"] - Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value exactly equal to a certain value. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[06:32:49] <stenno_> alright
[06:35:12] <seena> <Aamir> that is not working
[06:37:31] <sasori> hi, how to alter this code snippet in order for it to use a confirm box that asks  are you sure you want to delete artworkname? , then there's a yes or no button, http://pastebin.com/Zbi88QzQ
[06:39:17] <seutje> ?add
[06:39:17] <bot-t> .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[06:40:12] <seutje> hmm, any way I can get add to add elements at the start of the array instead of the end?
[06:40:25] <seutje> or wait, I can just reverse the array after adding all my crap
[06:43:41] <rns> does jquery UI work with IE 6 and 7
[06:43:42] <rns> ?
[06:44:40] <seutje> ah boo, I can't just $('.foo').add('.bar').reverse() :(
[06:45:19] <stenno_> seutje, what should that do?
[06:45:37] <keirlav> cant you use prepend()?
[06:45:40] <seutje> give me a collection of .bar and .foo instead of .foo and .bar
[06:45:46] <keirlav> ?prepend
[06:45:46] <bot-t> .prepend(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[06:45:47] <sukima> rns: It works but not very well in IE6. You should concider droping IE6 since Microsoft is killing it as well.
[06:45:58] <seutje> prepend will alter the elements
[06:46:04] <seutje> I only want to alter the collection
[06:46:34] <sukima> seutje: $('.bar').add('.foo'); ?
[06:46:51] <seutje> lol
[06:47:00] <seutje> yea, works fine for that simplified example
[06:47:11] <seutje> but I'm not using selectors or anything
[06:47:33] <Trudko> guys simple question just this little code(2 lines) to so it changes text (or innerHtml) of element(this) is span
[06:47:35] <seutje> just grabbing an element, going .prev() till I hit my condition and .add() all those to my collection
[06:47:48] <seutje> considering I'm going back, the order of the elements will be reversed
[06:47:50] <Trudko> because $(this).val does not seem to affect span element.s
[06:48:08] <Trudko> ops this is code http://pastebin.com/R3L0f3G1
[06:48:15] <sukima> seutje: var x = $('.foo'), y = $('.bar'); y = y.push(x);
[06:48:52] <Me-Selfe> Trudko: .html()
[06:49:36] <Trudko> .html() = "" ?
[06:49:51] <Trudko> can I just add line? what happen if element is not span
[06:49:55] <Me-Selfe> to get it use .html(), to set a different value .html('value');
[06:50:25] <Trudko> Me-Selfe:  so change line $(this).val(""); to $(this).html("").
[06:50:29] <Me-Selfe> yes
[06:50:32] <sukima> seutje: I would guess that you could use .reverse() on a collection as it's simply an array. Why does reverse() not work?
[06:50:42] <seutje> it's an object
[06:50:44] <rns> sukima, when is ms killing it?
[06:50:53] <Trudko> and it will work with also with input, select, textarea ?
[06:51:03] <seutje> ?eval $('.foo').reverse();
[06:51:05] <bot-t> seutje: TypeError: $(".foo").reverse is not a function
[06:51:15] <sukima> rns: IIRC MS stopped support for it a month ago and is advising all companies to upgrade to 7
[06:51:17] <seutje> see?
[06:51:21] <seutje> so I doubt I can push
[06:51:23] <sukima> rns: Looking for article....
[06:51:28] <seutje> ?eval $('.foo').push('lol');
[06:51:30] <bot-t> seutje: 1
[06:51:34] <seutje> ah
[06:51:36] <seutje> interesting
[06:52:26] <seutje> k, if I push, it's no longer a jquery object
[06:52:56] <stenno_> i thought $(".class") implied an array..?
[06:52:56] <erichynds> seutje: $.fn.reverse = [].reverse; ?
[06:53:30] <Me-Selfe> Trudko: .html() for span/divs etc... .val() for form elements
[06:54:00] <stenno_> isn't it the reason why you cant test: if($(".class")) , but have to if($(".class").length == 0) ?
[06:54:10] <sukima> rns: Perhaps I am wrong. I thought they dropped support. But can't find a source. However I found many sources that suggest everyone should dispite MS: http://www.ie6countdown.com/
[06:54:25] <erichynds> stenno_: $() returns an object, but gives it a length property so it looks like an array
[06:54:34] <stenno_> erichynds, oh i see!
[06:54:35] <seutje> erichynds: wow, why didn't I think of that, lol... guess I owe u a(nother) beer :D
[06:54:47] <stenno_> eric_kyle, ducktype style
[06:54:56] <stenno_> oops sorry eric_kyle wrong completion :)
[06:55:05] <stenno_> erichynds, , ducktype style
[06:55:07] <seutje> erichynds: should I capture the original method, if there is any?
[06:55:11] <erichynds> seutje: i remember that was going to land in jquery at one point but never did.  something about the elements not being in DOM order or something
[06:55:30] <erichynds> seutje: i don't follow
[06:55:30] <seutje> just in case some1 else defined a reverse method
[06:55:41] <erichynds> o rite
[06:55:46] <erichynds> sure!
[06:55:56] <seutje> don't wanna asplode my fellow dev's shizzle :D
[06:56:59] <sukima> seutje: stenno_: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.makeArray/
[06:57:17] <stenno_> sukima, i will look into this, thanks
[06:57:41] <seutje> sukima: I don't wanna pipe it back into a jquery function to be able to run jquery methods on it
[06:59:06] <Trudko> Me-Selfe: yeap so how to distinct between them? how do I find out if $(this) is span element?
[06:59:23] <sukima> seutje: Y not? $($.makeArray($('.foo,.bar')).reverse()).appendTo("#foo");
[06:59:49] <seutje> coz I don't wanna spin off unnecessary jquery objects
[07:00:09] <seutje> why not always use $($($($('.foo'))));?
[07:00:42] <Trudko> guys if I iterate ower elements how do I find if $(this) is span element?
[07:01:04] <MoTiOnXml> is there an event for listening to unload-events for iframes?
[07:01:07] <sukima> According to the docs that is how jQuery intended it to be used get a jQuery opbject. makeArray() then bracket it around the array $(array).doStuff();
[07:01:08] <MoTiOnXml> can only see "load"
[07:01:34] <lessless> hello, i want to loop thru the nested ul http://jsfiddle.net/Zxe9L/
[07:01:56] <sukima> I bracket jQuery object all the time. It not much in over head to have a function return the parameter immediatly if (obj.isJquryOrSomething()) return onj;
[07:02:03] <stenno_> sukima, i call ducktyping
[07:02:29] <sukima> Best I could come up with.
[07:02:40] <beeeevi7> guys, can anyone of you tell me what's the (internal) difference between $(document).ready(function() {}); and $(function() {}); is?
[07:02:53] <beeeevi7> is there any difference?
[07:03:00] <sukima> beeeevi7: nothing. they are synynms
[07:03:07] <systemfault> beeeevi7: Same thing
[07:03:09] <MoTiOnXml> .unload() doesn't work on iframes
[07:03:40] <beeeevi7> exactly the same thing or they just act in the same way?
[07:04:23] <erichynds> beeeevi7: exactly the same thing
[07:04:36] <beeeevi7> so i can drop $(document).ready() and use $(function()) instead and it will never ever make any kind of difference?
[07:04:44] <systemfault> beeeevi7: Yes.
[07:04:46] <beeeevi7> (and the other way round of course)
[07:04:52] <beeeevi7> ok, thank you ;)
[07:05:17] <beeeevi7> i need this for a small jquery beginner presentation i'm working at
[07:06:36] <Trudko> Me-Selfe: ok I have it I will use if($(this).is('span')) {
[07:08:46] <stenno_> Trudko, elegant
[07:10:01] <Trudko> stenno_: really  ? :D
[07:10:46] <JAAulde> Ok, jQuery 1.6.2, UI 1.8.14, IE7 (not including IE8 in 7 compat mode): Initial drag of a Draggable with helper set to clone is fine, second rag of same draggable crashes in UI's createHelper on a call to removeAttr() on the clone()'ed node. Anyone seen this or know a workaround?
[07:11:19] <stenno_> Trudko, imho yes
[07:13:22] <Trudko> stenno_: thx I was luckz enough to find solution of someone else :)
[07:15:27] <Aple> Best way to style forms?
[07:17:52] <MoTiOnXml> i'm experiencing some weird behaviour with unbind() and IE8 on DispHTMLWindow2 (i.e. an iframe window)
[07:18:10] <MoTiOnXml> when jQuery wants to delete the entry from the cache it can't find it; although it's actually there
[07:18:17] <erichynds> ?preloading
[07:18:17] <bot-t> Simple Preloading: $("<img/>").load(function(){}).attr("src",newsrc) <--- Note that you bind the load callback before changing the image src. Need more options? imagesLoaded callback: http://gist.github.com/268257¬†; BK's, with CSS powah: http://binarykitten.me.uk/dev/jq-plugins/107-jquery-image-preloader-plus-callbacks.html
[07:25:24] <MoTiOnXml> hmm, found a bug in jQuerys cache for IE8
[07:36:13] <lessless> ok, while $(element).children("ul").children("li").children("a") work and $(element).children("ul li a") dont ?
[07:36:20] <lessless> why ? :))
[07:36:49] <amcsi_work> how can I split selected elements into groups of 4?
[07:42:03] <stenno_> amcsi_work, try splice() from vanilla js
[07:42:06] <stenno_> slice
[07:42:07] <kborchers> amcsi_work: you could use a loop that increments a counter by four and then use that counter with see ?slice
[07:42:08] <bot-t> amcsi_work, .slice(start, [end]): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[07:42:18] <amcsi_work> okay, thanks
[07:42:28] <techzg> for slidetoggle could anyone pls verify the syntax?
[07:42:29] <techzg> http://jsfiddle.net/MrXUA/
[07:43:52] <kborchers> techzg: assuming your selector is correct, that syntax looks fine
[07:43:56] <necromancer> hey so i'm looking to implement a playhead-style progress bar for a plugin i'm making
[07:44:00] <johanhar> Hi. I need to use the function .live to bind all <a> tags to a function. $('a').live(each, function() etc - did not work. Any suggestions?
[07:44:06] <necromancer> i don't want to use jQuery UI because this is a plugin and i want it to be all-inclusive
[07:44:35] <ryrych> good afternoon guys :)
[07:44:41] <stenno_> johanhar, $('a').live("event", function(){}) is the syntax
[07:44:44] <johanhar> Arh each() is not an event..
[07:44:45] <necromancer> how would i do such a thing? i'm thinking of using .animate() to move the playhead from left to right using CSS positioning
[07:44:52] <kborchers> johanhar: any reason you don't just use see ?bind
[07:44:53] <bot-t> johanhar, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[07:45:10] <ryrych> I‚Äôve got a strange problem, could you please take a look at this snippet? http://jsfiddle.net/ynUSx/
[07:45:24] <johanhar> I cant use bind because the dom element does not exist yet, it is being manipulated by another plugin that is "living its own live"
[07:45:27] <necromancer> johanhar: an each() is a loop, not an event.
[07:45:28] <johanhar> life*
[07:45:38] <necromancer> it's like foreach
[07:45:53] <techzg> kborchers: could you please see if there are any errors on the following url
[07:45:54] <techzg> http://www.h2osampler.com/knowledgebase/faq.htm
[07:46:47] <necromancer> johanhar: also .live/.bind/etc. will bind events to everything that matches the selector in $(). so if you have 5 <a>s on the page, and you do $('a').click, it'll bind that action to all 5 <a> tags.
[07:46:58] <necromancer> so you don't need an each loop inside of it
[07:48:35] <kborchers> techzg: there are a lot of issues there. you have multiple html, head, and body tags. that's not going to work well, plus I don't see the jQuery library included
[07:49:54] <techzg> kborchers: the js library is included as in the following line
[07:49:56] <techzg> script language="javascript" src="includes/js/jquery-1.6.2.min.js"></script>
[07:50:58] <ryrych> anyone? :)
[07:51:19] <ryrych> I would like to know why it happens
[07:51:34] <caz> Hi there
[07:51:40] <ryrych> Hi caz
[07:52:20] <kborchers> techzg: ok, but you're including it after you try to reference it from nexsenskb.js and you should still fix that issue with multiple html, head and body tags
[07:52:22] <caz> I came here because i got a litle problem
[07:52:36] <stenno_> what problem might that be...?
[07:52:41] <caz> Hehe :)
[07:53:54] <caz> I got a list, and with jquery I want to remove a class (easy) but my problem is that I want to remove classes of all the children of the parent of the button ($(this).parent().children()), but that seems to be incorrect
[07:54:36] <kborchers> ?siblings @ caz
[07:54:37] <bot-t> caz, .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[07:55:26] <caz> kborchers: Oh, siblings seems interesting, testing right now :)
[07:57:09] <caz> Oh, thanks, working well :)
[07:59:29] <caz> I also need a small advice. I just start using jquery and javascript and I don't really understand all the syntax, is there some "step by step" tutorials to begin?
[08:02:47] <Vorspire> ?101 @ caz
[08:02:48] <bot-t> caz, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html

[08:07:23] <coachz> I'm trying to populate a list box with jquery.  My values show up on line 2 and 3 but I don't get them on line 5 or 6.  what am i missing please ?   https://gist.github.com/1067456
[08:08:18] <nerc> does anyone have experience with jQuery Multiple File Upload Plugin
[08:08:40] <nerc> I got alot of problems storing the selected files into a collection to upload them
[08:09:08] <kborchers[A]> coachz: your elements should be in an array [] not a js object {}
[08:09:20] <coachz> umm
[08:09:37] <coachz> so instead of what i'm currently doing which is:    var arrayFromPHP = <?php echo json_encode($EmailsArray) ?>;
[08:10:05] <nerc> Im not sure if it could be the combination of this plugin combined with groovy, any experience?
[08:11:13] <kborchers> coachz: no, inside of append, it should be $('#emailaddresses').append($("<option/>"), [elem.EmailAddress, elem.User]);
[08:11:26] <Skizu> Heyyy
[08:11:30] <coachz> ahhh
[08:11:46] <sukima> coachz: I think what you want is thisL: https://gist.github.com/1067468
[08:11:50] <Skizu> *That
[08:11:51] <Skizu> I've a PHP question really not much of a jQuery one - anyone here can help with the o:?
[08:12:29] <Skizu> Basically - I've $db = new Database();
[08:12:38] <kborchers> coachz: but that is only if you really want to append. if you're trying to set value and text of the option, you'll need something else which i will throw together real quick
[08:12:46] <coachz> sukima,  i still get an empty list box
[08:12:55] <coachz> i'm just trying to build the list box
[08:13:01] <coachz> from my data
[08:13:16] <Skizu> And just doing it in the included files doesnt work as it bitchs about being a non-object after o:
[08:13:22] <sukima> coachz: Reading API. I think I was wrong. Stand by..
[08:14:46] <kborchers> coachz: untested but something like this might work http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/b52gy/
[08:15:08] <sukima> coachz: This is what you want I figured it out: https://gist.github.com/1067468
[08:15:11] <coachz> works
[08:15:19] <coachz> nice job
[08:15:25] <coachz> now let me see what you did :-)
[08:15:40] <coachz> ahh attr.   nice
[08:15:52] <HannesP> at a stage in my code, i remove all child nodes from a div and then put them back in a slightly different way. during the process, they lose their click handlers. is there any way to avoid this...?
[08:16:16] <coachz> that's perfect.  thanks so much !
[08:17:07] <sukima> kborchers: Don't forget to use clone() or you changing the opriginal <option/>
[08:17:12] <stenno_> HannesP, maybe .live ?
[08:17:17] <kborchers> HannesP: see ?clone and use the withDataAndEvents param
[08:17:18] <bot-t> HannesP, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[08:17:23] <Skizu> xD guess not :9

[08:19:15] <sukima> not the help I was looking for
[08:20:53] <sukima> How do you use bot-t ?
[08:21:59] <HannesP> cloning worked exellently, thanks kborchers
[08:22:03] <HannesP> *excellently
[08:24:09] <JAAulde> we have narrowed our IE7 crash for UI Drag N Drop to inside of removeAttr on the cloned helper node...the call to removeAttributeNode() is crashing IE7--anyone have any thoughts?
[08:24:44] <stenno_> don't support IE<9 ? sorry...
[08:25:19] <JAAulde> all my laughter has turned to tears at this point
[08:25:35] <sukima> coachz: I tested that in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/sukima/ap3jn/
[08:26:01] <coachz> i need to learn this fiddle thing :-)
[08:26:12] <JAAulde> kborchers: Do you recall my quandry from yesterday at all--when I was discussing that DnD bug you fixed in UI?
[08:26:23] <bedspax> hi guys
[08:27:13] <Skizu> So no one can help poor skizu
[08:27:16] <kborchers> JAAulde: i do. do you have a link or reduced test case?
[08:27:24] <bedspax> i want to  increase height of a div and i want to slideup the height increased
[08:27:27] <bedspax> which solution?
[08:27:31] <bedspax> you advice to me?
[08:27:38] <JAAulde> kborchers: I have not been able to reproduce, so no.
[08:28:20] <kborchers> JAAulde: hmmm, gonna be hard to help track it down if I can't see it, you know?
[08:28:26] <sukima> Skizu: try asking in #php
[08:28:35] <Skizu> #php is invite only ?
[08:28:59] <stenno_> Skizu, really..?
[08:29:01] <sukima> is it?
[08:29:05] <stenno_> whoa
[08:29:13] <Skizu> Far as i know ?
[08:29:15] <JAAulde> kborchers: we tracked down the crash to jQuery core in removeAttr - IE7 goes into a branch of logic which causes it to use removeAttributeNode(). That is being called on the cloned helper element. BUt nothing I do to try to reproduce problems with removeAttributeNode() causes the crash
[08:29:18] <stenno_> another reason why php sucks
[08:29:26] <Skizu> Lol
[08:29:36] <JAAulde> kborchers: indeed, I do understand that wihtout a reproduction, it is almost impossible for anyone to help
[08:29:54] <Skizu> Another reason is the fact that it wont piss off and let my PDO be global via just using include D:!
[08:29:58] <JAAulde> Skizu: AFAIK, ##php is the PHP chan
[08:30:19] <Skizu> ##php told me to f off also
[08:30:33] <Skizu> Said i needed some bs
[08:30:39] <JAAulde> Skizu: ##php is garbage and full of assholes. #phpwomen is cool, though
[08:30:41] <kborchers> JAAulde: have you searched bugs.jquery.com to see if there are any known bugs with removeAttr in core and if not, maybe try filing one to see if they can help
[08:30:48] <Skizu> lol what
[08:31:10] <Skizu> Question ;D how to you join a channel without leaving Q_Q
[08:31:14] <Skizu> I'm an IRC noob lol
[08:31:15] <sukima> Skizu: That is why I switched to RoR
[08:31:16] <JAAulde> kborchers: yeah, we've been googling and searching.  I do hate ot open a bug without a reproduction, though. anywho, will keep poking.  Thanks!
[08:31:31] <sukima> Skizu: /join
[08:31:43] <JAAulde> Skizu: no joke, #phpwomen is a good chan. just be respectful :)
[08:31:48] <Skizu> :p pfft
[08:32:09] <kborchers> JAAulde: yeah sorry i couldn't be more help. if you get a test case working ping me and i'd be glad to take a look, though if you get a test case working, you'll probably see the problem yourself ;)
[08:32:12] <Skizu> Never looked at RoR before - too lazy pissing about learning farrrrr too languages at once :p
[08:32:28] <stenno_> ruby ftw
[08:32:35] <Skizu> Tbh
[08:32:35] <JAAulde> kborchers: heh, cool.  thanks
[08:32:45] <Skizu> $var = new Class();
[08:32:47] <sukima> +1 stenno_
[08:32:56] <Skizu> That's all i need in a global file ye
[08:32:58] <Skizu> ....
[08:33:04] <Skizu> E.g. just include the file ye
[08:33:23] <Rushing> what's the problem Skizu?
[08:33:30] <Skizu> Dont wanna have to do gloabl $var; then include it as a protected var for each class that needs the db
[08:33:32] <Skizu> Its just fail
[08:33:35] <sukima> HOw about var MyClass = function() { ... };
[08:33:51] * sukima can't hold a strait face
[08:33:53] <Skizu> PHP not js sukima
[08:34:16] <stenno_> lol you ever looked at array operations in php? its just pathetic
[08:34:39] <stenno_> even worse than in js
[08:35:00] <Rushing> yet ##php will attack you like maniacs if you paste a code snippet with short tags
[08:35:00] <bedspax> uhm
[08:35:02] <bedspax> is animate() ?
[08:35:04] <bedspax> i want to  increase height of a div and i want to slideup the height increased
[08:35:55] <Skizu> Rushing: I want to be lazy - just want 1 instance of a class and dont want to have to write anything extra to have it...
[08:36:06] <diamonds> is there a jquery function to get the offset from page top?
[08:36:17] <diamonds> like this http://www.michaelapproved.com/articles/object-position-top-and-left-offset-on-a-page/
[08:36:21] <Predator> hi
[08:36:29] <diamonds> I see this http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[08:36:30] <Skizu> So $var = Class(); want that global... without using global as that's just fail and not even worth being used or looked at xD
[08:36:35] <Predator> how to negate .is(':visible') ?
[08:36:36] <diamonds> but it's just the same (from the parent, not page)
[08:36:52] <diamonds> Predator: .not(':visible') ?
[08:37:07] <diamonds> there's probably another pseudoselector for it tho..
[08:37:20] <stenno_> :invisible?
[08:37:25] <stenno_> or !:visible..?
[08:37:28] <Rushing> Skizu, you could probably do a function that gets your global instance
[08:37:41] <Skizu> I could
[08:37:45] <Predator> not : Remove elements from the set of matched
[08:37:45] <Predator> elements.
[08:37:48] <Rushing> but then it's still not as clean as it sounds like you want
[08:37:49] <Skizu> But it wouldnt make a difference ?
[08:37:57] <Skizu> E.g.
[08:38:07] <Skizu> I want it to be made in one of the included files
[08:38:23] <Skizu> Then just use it in the main files
[08:38:24] <sukima> Skizu: is this what you want? https://gist.github.com/1067545
[08:39:21] <b-lew> can I score some help. I need to change this current number that has a background of white from the li to the link and it breaks everytime i do it
[08:39:22] <b-lew> http://turnpost.com/clients/koleyjessen/#
[08:39:42] <Skizu> sukima
[08:39:46] <Skizu> That gets me no further ?
[08:40:44] <Skizu> i did a simple function returning the same instance and it bitch slapped me with blah blah blah non-object blah blah blah
[08:40:49] <Skizu> yet it obv was >_>
[08:41:20] <Rushing> just use global...welcome to php scope
[08:41:24] <Predator> thx, i mistyped my class name :/
[08:41:31] <sukima> don't know. I only copy pasted from the PHP docs. perhaps you coulod gist it
[08:41:49] <Skizu> GLOBAL IS SHIT
[08:41:50] <Skizu> Q_Q
[08:42:11] <Rushing> yeah, PHP scope is no fun. i agree
[08:42:17] <Skizu> Got to type like 10times more to use global then just making a new instance :/
[08:42:41] <sukima> Perhaps the investment into ruby is worth it?
[08:42:54] <Skizu> What harm can multiple PDO instances do o.o?
[08:42:56] <Rushing> maybe create a static method in your class that retreives the global instance?
[08:43:03] <b-lew> can I grab some quick help.
[08:43:03] <Skizu> sukima
[08:43:05] <Rushing> MyClass::instance()->method('yo')
[08:43:08] <Skizu> Possibly :P
[08:43:36] <Skizu> But im also learning VB.NET C# and C++ and a couple of their sub languages
[08:43:53] <Skizu> And tbh ruby might tip me into insanity :p
[08:46:21] <mdel_> lol if you have scope issues in PHP, you are doing it wrong...
[08:46:47] <Skizu> Lol global is shit
[08:46:52] <Skizu> D:
[08:46:54] <Rushing> php is doing scope wrong
[08:46:57] <Rushing> :o
[08:47:03] <Skizu> Haha ye rushing
[08:47:12] <mdel_> Rushing: php has very basic scoping
[08:47:21] <mdel_> there isnt much to get "wrong"
[08:47:32] <Rushing> well yeah, it's "logical", but just bad
[08:47:37] * mdel_ notes that JS scope is much more complex...
[08:48:02] <mdel_> Rushing: I don't see anything about PHP's variable scope that is bad
[08:48:04] <Skizu> It's a lot of...
[08:48:11] <Skizu> Saying the same shit over and over and over and over
[08:48:13] <Skizu> Etc again
[08:48:16] <Rushing> ^^
[08:48:20] <Rushing> bad
[08:48:20] <mdel_> then you are doing it wrong...
[08:48:29] <Skizu> mdel_
[08:48:31] <Skizu> >_>
[08:48:36] <mdel_> give me a sample of your code
[08:48:36] <Skizu> $var = new Class();
[08:48:41] <Skizu> There
[08:48:44] <Skizu> Make it global
[08:48:44] <Skizu> :3
[08:48:56] <Skizu> $var without making it longer than 1 line
[08:49:04] <mdel_> the fact that you need it to be global is what you are doing wrong :)
[08:49:05] <Skizu> ;D unless its in an include file
[08:49:06] <Skizu> ;D
[08:49:16] <Skizu> It's the db object o.o
[08:49:24] <Skizu> So erm ye want a single global instance
[08:49:42] <Rushing> Skizu, did you see my suggestion to just make the class's methods static?
[08:49:51] <stenno_> Skizu, C# voluntarily?
[08:50:00] <mdel_> Skizu: there are many ways to handle that
[08:50:21] <mdel_> Skizu: your framework should bootstrap a DB object if that is the functionality you need
[08:50:22] <sukima> Skizu: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern
[08:50:38] <Rushing> or at least one static method of the class to retrieve a global instance
[08:50:54] <Skizu> stenno_: Yep xD all is
[08:51:06] <Skizu> I didnt Rushing ?
[08:51:11] <sukima> Skizu: even better: http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.patterns.php
[08:51:13] <mdel_> Skizu: and you complain about PHP... lol
[08:51:22] <sukima> Look for singleton
[08:51:24] <mdel_> Skizu: go take a look at the 1.5 million PHP frameworks out there
[08:51:35] <mdel_> they will show you how to bootstrap a DB object singleton
[08:51:36] <stenno_> Skizu, C# is EVEN WORSE than php (if you can compare them)
[08:52:04] <Rushing> stenno_, you can't be serious...
[08:52:15] <mdel_> Rushing: he is serious, and he is 100% correct ;)
[08:52:17] <Rushing> C# is a league above php. there is not comparison
[08:52:19] <Skizu> Or worse harder ?
[08:52:19] <Skizu> C# is worse the way its made
[08:53:01] <Skizu> C# is where Java wanted to be :p
[08:53:06] <stenno_> how do you make a dynamic array in C#?
[08:53:14] <Skizu> Read about java's new release
[08:53:51] <stenno_> lets make method names upcase! great design idea!
[08:53:55] <Skizu> stenno_: Fk knows :P got shit installed not looked at it ye just read about a few of the basics on it o.O
[08:54:13] <stenno_> Skizu, learn: ruby, javascript, C
[08:54:18] <mdel_> ^^^
[08:54:18] <sukima> The world should just be writen in Javascript and leave it at that. JS ftw!
[08:54:22] <stenno_> don't learn any other languages :P
[08:54:33] <Skizu> Urg
[08:54:35] <rns> how can I change the text-size attribute with javascript?  http://jsfiddle.net/b4Fjr/
[08:54:36] <Skizu> C -.-
[08:54:38] <mdel_> Skizu: learn ruby, javascript, and C
[08:54:42] <mdel_> then you can learn ANY language
[08:54:47] <stenno_> ^
[08:54:50] <Skizu> Ah
[08:54:57] <Skizu> Is C a lot like C++ ?
[08:54:58] <Skizu> Or java ?
[08:55:01] <stenno_> yeah
[08:55:04] <Skizu> I know java and js pretty well
[08:55:20] <stenno_> C++ is "C with classes"
[08:55:30] <Skizu> lol i see
[08:56:16] <Skizu> Well I'm still young so lets hope i can get these down before im 15 ;D
[08:57:28] <Skizu> Well i'm off home cya guys
[08:57:52] <stenno_> keep learning and dump C#
[08:57:56] <stenno_> and php
[08:57:58] <stenno_> and java
[08:58:05] <rns> how do I change the text-size elemnt on a table with jquery?
[08:58:30] <Skizu> Lol stenno
[08:58:38] <Skizu> Why drop C# ?
[08:58:41] <Haprog> rns: there is no text-size attribute or element. there is only font-size in css
[08:58:50] <Rushing> dude, don't dump c#. the .net framework is a beauty
[08:58:53] <Skizu> Got loads of sexy features?
[08:58:56] <Rushing> stick with php for open source
[08:59:05] <Skizu> PHP = Free
[08:59:10] <Rushing> or java...but that's a fragile one
[08:59:12] <Skizu> XD main reason i started with it
[08:59:16] <rns> Haprog, okay, how do I change the font-size element then?
[08:59:31] <Skizu> java i learnt at college
[08:59:31] <Rushing> MS web developer and the .net framework are free too
[08:59:32] <necromancer> Skizu: everything is free if you have a demonoid account
[08:59:37] <Skizu> What's simple and clean
[08:59:39] <Rushing> there is just a larger open source community for php
[08:59:44] <stenno_> Skizu, ruby
[08:59:48] <Skizu> demonoid o.O?
[08:59:48] <sukima> rns: use css: http://jsfiddle.net/sukima/D3E9V/
[08:59:49] <necromancer> Rushing: yeah but the tools to compile & edit them are not, iirc
[09:00:03] <necromancer> Skizu: bittorrent tracker
[09:00:08] <skroot> if I have multiple sets of .data entries, is there a way to find the last one?
[09:00:12] <Haprog> ?.css
[09:00:12] <bot-t> .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[09:00:13] <skroot> when the number varies
[09:00:14] <Skizu> Lol i see
[09:00:27] <Haprog> ?.css @rns
[09:00:28] <bot-t> rns, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[09:00:35] <Rushing> necromancer, visual web developer will compile the dll for you...
[09:00:36] <necromancer> skroot: what do you mean "sets of .data() entries"? .data() is for grabbing data-attributes from the markup
[09:00:40] <Skizu> Ye well i'm off lol talk tomorrow ;)
[09:00:44] <necromancer> Rushing: is that free?
[09:00:47] <Rushing> and the code hinting in VWD are unmatched
[09:00:48] <Rushing> yes it is
[09:00:52] <necromancer> oh cool
[09:00:56] <necromancer> that's nice then
[09:01:01] <necromancer> before you had to buy visual studio
[09:01:26] <Rushing> you still do. it's kind of a lightweight version, but if you're creating web apps, you don't really need the studio
[09:01:39] <Rushing> it's very full featured, just not the studio
[09:01:45] <Skizu> (I used vwd and its shit - used visual studio 2008 and 2010 and t2008 is the best for me)
[09:01:47] <necromancer> oh
[09:01:54] <Skizu> I was only messing with basic shit tho :P
[09:01:59] <necromancer> i'm on mac actually so i just use textmate & browsers
[09:02:04] <Skizu> Any counter comments on that ?
[09:02:10] <stenno_> vim > everything else
[09:02:14] <necromancer> haha stenno_
[09:02:18] <Rushing> Skizu, "you're doing it wrong" :P
[09:02:21] <necromancer> you broke the record!
[09:02:31] <Skizu> Q_Q
[09:02:37] <Skizu> That's it
[09:02:39] <Skizu> Im going home
[09:02:45] <Skizu> Lol seriously cya
[09:02:50] <necromancer> Skizu: no, you're just not using the right tools. visual studio is for .NET development. just use a regular text editor & browsers for web dev
[09:03:04] <necromancer> your favorite text editor, firefox & firebug should be the only IDE you'll ever need
[09:03:11] <stenno_> ^
[09:03:15] <sukima> VIM ftw!
[09:03:23] <stenno_> vim!
[09:03:31] <necromancer> stenno_: you broke the record for how long after i mention textmate, someone mentions vim
[09:03:34] <necromancer> 3 seconds
[09:03:37] <stenno_> necromancer, :P
[09:03:42] <necromancer> fucking vim devs you're all the same
[09:03:44] <necromancer> ;)
[09:03:53] <stenno_> textmate is the best IDE on osx though
[09:04:02] <stenno_> you can forget terminal apps on OSX imho
[09:04:06] <necromancer> it's kind-of an IDE...
[09:04:10] <necromancer> well there's MacVim
[09:04:12] <necromancer> lots of people us ethat
[09:04:15] <stenno_> but it sucks
[09:04:17] <necromancer> it's basically just a Cocoa wrapper
[09:04:22] <brianarn> Vim and Chrome fo' life
[09:04:23] <necromancer> eh i don't think it's any different from vim
[09:04:24] <stenno_> in comparison to the linux vim
[09:04:37] <necromancer> like it looks about the same and i guess it has menus but i never use them
[09:04:50] <stenno_> to be honest, i just said that even though i am not sure about that :P
[09:04:54] <brianarn> MacVim is Vim that supports several Mac keyboard shortcuts like cmd+s and cmd+c etc, which is handy. :)
[09:05:10] <necromancer> stenno_: yeah macvim's basically just a wrapper over vim + bash
[09:05:14] <sukima> rns: Here is a good example: http://jsfiddle.net/sukima/D3E9V/
[09:05:16] <stenno_> ah
[09:05:27] <Rushing> simple is good, but you can't devalue a good IDE...
[09:05:37] <skroot> necromancer, i have a function in my wordpress theme that generates .data arguments for different entries in our portfolio
[09:05:37] <stenno_> Rushing, ... like vim?
[09:05:43] <Rushing> lol yeah, like vim -_-
[09:05:46] <rns> sukima, cool thanks - how would you reduce the default text size on that?
[09:05:53] <skroot> so if we have 9 sites in our portfolio, i have 9 .data entries
[09:06:03] <stenno_> hehe wordpress
[09:06:04] <skroot> i want to know that i have 9 though, without manually counting
[09:06:33] <Rushing> sense it, skroot. use the force
[09:07:08] <skroot> ok then
[09:07:11] <skroot> thanks for the help
[09:07:18] <Rushing> welcome, ++?
[09:07:22] <sukima> rns: use font-size with a different size like 0.6em see: http://w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp for deatails on css measuerments
[09:07:40] <Rushing> skroot, are you asking how to crawl the file system and count stuff?
[09:08:32] <skroot> no, not at all
[09:08:51] <guy_> what's the syntax for multiple :not()?
[09:08:59] <necromancer> skroot: well if you just do $('#element').data(), you'll get an object that's just key-value pairs of each data attribute in the tag
[09:09:00] <guy_> li:not(":animated .centered")
[09:09:02] <guy_> ?
[09:09:15] <guy_> like, not animated and not with .centred class
[09:09:16] <Rushing> comma, just like a regular selector
[09:09:18] <necromancer> skroot: you can iterate over that object with a .each loop, and just increment the count for every attribute you encounter
[09:09:27] <skroot> hrmmm
[09:09:29] <Eber> Hey guys... I'm responding a json/ajax request and one of the elements is an actual HTML element, but when I try to render it with jquery's template system, the element is not rendered but rather printed... is there anyway around it?
[09:09:29] <skroot> maybe im doing it wrong
[09:09:35] <skroot> each .data is one entry for my portfolio
[09:09:38] <necromancer> skroot: that'll get you a count. i don't think there's an easier way to do that...unfortunately it's not an array so .length won't work
[09:09:43] <skroot> it contains the work we did, the service checklist, the url, the name, etc
[09:09:45] <skroot> and an ID
[09:09:48] <necromancer> skroot: wait what?
[09:09:52] <skroot> its generated from a shortcode i wrote in wordpress
[09:09:53] <rns> sukima, do you know why this won't work?  http://jsfiddle.net/b4Fjr/1/
[09:10:12] <Rushing> skroot, i don't think we understand your issue
[09:10:13] <necromancer> skroot: so your question is not what you're looking for
[09:10:22] <Rushing> what do you want to do with the .data files and where are you getting stuck
[09:10:45] <skroot> http://webdrafterhost3.com/webdrafter.com/portfolio-new-web-design/
[09:10:48] <skroot> thats my page
[09:11:04] <skroot> in the content-entry section there are 4 .data entries generated
[09:11:16] <skroot> i just need the ID of the last one
[09:11:46] <skroot> almost like :last-child in css
[09:12:23] <Rushing> oh, create an array
[09:12:27] <Eber> {{html element}} is my answer :) thanks!
[09:12:34] <b-lew> http://turnpost.com/clients/koleyjessen/# any reason why my "current" page indicator doesn't change when it changes slides‚Ä¶ it just stays there...
[09:12:45] <stenno_> Eber, looks like Mustache..?
[09:13:01] <Rushing> var projects = []; projects.push({name:...}); $("#porfolioDetails").data("projects", projects);
[09:13:03] <Eber> stenno_  jquery's own template sustem
[09:13:05] <Eber> system*
[09:13:20] <stenno_> oh i see
[09:13:26] <stenno_> gotta look into that
[09:14:06] <Rushing> skroot, make sense?
[09:15:34] <Rushing> push to the projects array instead of setting the $(...).data(), then after that, attach the projects array to the element with data(). then you have a standard array
[09:16:20] <skroot> it makes sense, yes
[09:16:21] <skroot> thank you
[09:16:24] <Rushing> the only other way would be to get the full data object from the element, loop through it with for(var x in y) and test if the property name is a number, use it, increment something, etc, but that's way less reliable
[09:16:26] <skroot> i just have to make the changes
[09:21:58] <b-lew> any one have a second to help a brother out?
[09:24:33] <stenno_> b-lew, not if you wont tell us what it is about...?
[09:24:43] <jquerynewb> Hello
[09:25:38] <b-lew> stenno-> http://turnpost.com/clients/koleyjessen/#¬†any reason why my "current" page indicator doesn't change when it changes slides‚Ä¶ it just stays there...
[09:25:54] <b-lew> after it cycles through the first time
[09:26:05] <b-lew> the off state isn't working
[09:26:06] <jquerynewb> I'm using jquery form plugin and would like to bind it to a form I'm loading with .load
[09:26:41] <nerc> hello, im trying to get a multiple upload work but sadly im running against a wall :S i used jQuery Multiple File Upload Plugin for the first start. Can someone advice me another way or is this plugin a good way to go?
[09:26:44] <jquerynewb> I'm new to this, and am unsure how I could do that...
[09:27:12] <jquerynewb> hmmm
[09:27:21] <stenno_> b-lew, can you provide a non-minified version? -.-
[09:27:42] <stenno_> and one which is reduced to the problem...?
[09:28:01] <b-lew> stenno-> http://pastie.org/2172994
[09:28:15] <b-lew> ummm var A seems to be the problem
[09:28:31] <stenno_> _non-minified_
[09:28:35] <b-lew> line 84 stenno and 107
[09:28:42] <stenno_> i can't read code like that, sorry
[09:28:51] <b-lew> oh okay.
[09:28:57] <b-lew> that is what the plugin came with
[09:29:12] <stenno_> i see
[09:29:23] <b-lew> http://www.htmldrive.net/items/show/570/Number-slideshow-simple-and-practical-numbers-image-slideshow-jQuery-plugin.html
[09:29:50] <Rushing> yeah that's like...minified with line breaks lol
[09:30:21] <b-lew> i didn't realize it was bad code. sorry
[09:30:34] <jquerynewb> http://jsfiddle.net/b9cCw/ I think my question is pretty simple... would there be someone who could assist  ?
[09:30:37] <necromancer> b-lew: don't use that damn site's code man
[09:31:08] <jquerynewb> or tell me it's not possible.
[09:31:15] <Rushing> b-lew, checkout cycle. it's served me well
[09:31:16] <necromancer> b-lew: learn how to write it yourself, or why can't you use something like http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/
[09:31:20] <b-lew> sorry, I didn't know any better. Once I make this quick fix i'm done
[09:31:41] <JAAulde> ugh, gettin' my ass handed to me by IE
[09:32:00] <stenno_> jquerynewb, where is your markup..?
[09:32:02] <necromancer> b-lew: it's cool, tons of people do it. we should have something in the /topic that says it
[09:32:04] <Rushing> b-lew, could be hard to find. if you can figure out where in that code the new border is being set, (somewhere near a ...eq(x)), you can reset all of the borders on the target's siblings
[09:32:47] <b-lew> its being set in line 84 Rushing
[09:33:01] <b-lew> I changed it from background-color to border
[09:33:05] <b-lew> maybe thats why
[09:33:09] <necromancer> jquerynewb: don't use .load(), use .get()
[09:34:03] <necromancer> jquerynewb: .get is a little different looking but it does the same thing. it'll grab the <form> you're loading in and place it in the <div> of your choice, but it doesn't require a selector you just do $.get('url-to-form.html', function(response) { $('#div').html(response); });
[09:34:17] <b-lew> fixed it
[09:34:18] <b-lew> nm
[09:34:20] <b-lew> thanks all
[09:34:36] <jquerynewb> @necromancer ok I'll look it up and try it.
[09:34:55] <necromancer> jquerynewb: in that callback function (which is equiv to $.ajax's success callback), you can then do $('#div').find('form').ajaxSubmit or whatever you're doing with the form plugin
[09:35:22] <b-lew> I really do need to learn jquery better‚Ä¶ I just don't have a mentor‚Ä¶ its tuff stuff ya know?
[09:35:23] <Rushing> funny how fast steve jobs killed home page flash banners...
[09:35:34] <jquerynewb> @necromancer I just don't want it leaving the page.
[09:35:45] <jquerynewb> it's a shitty shopping cart, and won't let me put php in it's templates.
[09:35:57] <jquerynewb> so I've goto load a search form written in php from another page...
[09:36:08] <jquerynewb> I just want it to look like it's running in the little box on the page.
[09:36:31] <necromancer> jquerynewb: yeah you're gonna want to run the javascript that instantiates the form plugin in the success callback of your ajax (get) call
[09:36:34] <jquerynewb> goto = got to
[09:36:40] <necromancer> that should work for you
[09:37:04] <jquerynewb> ok yeah I was going to do that, and then callbacks to load the next parts of the dependant dropdowns with the callbacks... that should work right ?
[09:37:17] <necromancer> jquerynewb: honestly i almost never use $('element').load or $.get, i always use $.ajax because it's consistent and offers the most control
[09:37:39] <jquerynewb> I'm just really new to this, and am fine with learning the right way.
[09:37:47] <necromancer> jquerynewb: yeah. but be careful, you're entering callback hell. :)
[09:38:02] <necromancer> it's fine, it may just get complicated. but it's part of javascript
[09:38:22] <necromancer> considering your situation requires a bit of a hack to get shit working right...
[09:38:55] <jquerynewb> @necromancer erm... so since I shouldn't use .get what would the be $.ajax way  ?
[09:39:27] <necromancer> jquerynewb: it's all running through $.ajax at the end of the day, all of that shit is just shortcuts for it
[09:39:33] <stenno> .get implies async call, doesn't it?
[09:39:50] <necromancer> jquerynewb: i'm saying familiarize yourself with $.ajax now, and all of this will be way easier to deal with
[09:39:53] <jquerynewb> ok... just attempting to learn.
[09:39:57] <stenno> isnt .get just a wrapper for $.ajax{method: 'get' ..} ?
[09:40:00] <jquerynewb> ahhh check... ty.
[09:40:03] <necromancer> stenno: it is, as i just said
[09:40:07] <stenno> oh sorry
[09:40:15] <necromancer> stenno: and .load is a wrapper for $.get
[09:40:22] <stenno> ah!
[09:45:11] <guy_> can this be done with jQuery UI
[09:45:12] <guy_> http://sourceforge.net/p/clicknscroll/home/Home/
[09:45:12] <guy_> ?
[09:45:15] <systemfault> and .get is a wrapper on .ajax :P
[09:45:58] <sukima> rns: Because your set jsfiddle to use mootools not jquery. Also you have a script tage in the javascript. in jsfiddle the $9document).ready() is redundent
[09:49:35] <guy_> anyone?
[09:49:35] <webBuilder> hey friends to disable a button I know you have to do .attr('diabled', true). what would append when I run the program the cursor become an arrow but still if I press the button an action is taken place
[09:49:39] <webBuilder> why this happening
[09:49:40] <webBuilder> ?
[09:50:37] <webBuilder> I also check the source generated by .attr(), it is correct
[09:50:54] <webBuilder> anyone faced similar problem as me ?
[09:51:20] <acidjazz> ok this is fucking killing me
[09:51:23] <acidjazz> any jquery function i writ
[09:51:24] <acidjazz> ein IE9
[09:51:27] <acidjazz> i get object expected
[09:51:40] <acidjazz> even $('.test').clickfunctino() { });
[09:51:45] <acidjazz> ERROR OBJECT EXPECTED
[09:51:46] <acidjazz> etc
[09:51:52] <acidjazz> err click(function() { });
[09:51:53] <sukima> webBuilder: show an example in jsfiddle
[09:58:25] <webBuilder> sukima, here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/rDLwZ/
[09:58:59] <webBuilder> hope you will see some error that I couldn't see
[09:59:27] <SeanJM> anyone here by change ever make a theme layer for livejournal?
[09:59:40] <SeanJM> change=chance
[10:01:38] <acidjazz> i think i figured it out
[10:01:59] <webBuilder> sukima, actually here is the accurate one http://jsfiddle.net/rDLwZ/1/
[10:01:59] <acidjazz> ie9 doesnt like this style: var stuff = { test: function() { });
[10:02:33] <sukima> webBuilder: It looks syntactically correct. http://jsfiddle.net/sukima/pc665/
[10:02:38] <sonotos> acidjazz: what makes the last )
[10:03:11] <sonotos> shouldn't that be a }
[10:03:42] <danst> hello guys; I'm having a trouble executing jquery on a page dynamically loaded with .load method, any suggestions on a solution?
[10:03:42] <acidjazz> oh
[10:03:43] <acidjazz> yea
[10:03:44] <acidjazz> i just typed it out
[10:03:49] <acidjazz> thats def not hte issue
[10:04:11] <sukima> acidjazz: Had me neurvous as I use that style of syntax all the time!
[10:04:21] <webBuilder> sukima, thank you, then why is not working :(
[10:04:28] <sonotos> well if ie9 really has problem with that i'm dead
[10:04:50] <webBuilder> something going on here.. but I'm thinking all the browser are not following what they suppose to be following for I do not see any error on my code
[10:05:03] <webBuilder> the funny thing is none of them work
[10:05:10] <webBuilder> they all are behaving the same way
[10:05:15] <acidjazz> sukima: check this out
[10:05:23] <sukima> webBuilder: it works in jsfiddle You sure it's not working?
[10:05:35] <acidjazz> if i do $('.input'.keydown(function(e) { console.log(e.keyCode; });
[10:05:37] <acidjazz> it works fine sukima
[10:05:40] <acidjazz> but if i do
[10:05:58] <acidjazz> var test = { init: function() { thatsamecode } }
[10:05:59] <webBuilder> sukima, I can paste every thing for the sake of investigation right now and see what is going on
[10:06:02] <acidjazz> then run test.init();
[10:06:12] <acidjazz> i get object expected on the begining line $('.input...
[10:06:13] <acidjazz> the hell
[10:06:34] <sonotos> hmmm
[10:06:48] <sukima> acidjazz: put in on jsfiddle see if you can recreate the problem there
[10:07:46] <sukima> webBuilder: I won't help if you do that. narrow down the offending code and test that on jsfiddle. You have to go through systematically and you'll probubkly find a null refference somewhere
[10:08:08] <acidjazz> does jsfiddle support console.log
[10:08:32] <acidjazz> ok
[10:08:32] <sukima> acidjazz: yes choose jQuery (edge) frame work and there is a check box for firebug lite.
[10:08:44] <acidjazz> sukima: http://jsfiddle.net/qDBVX/
[10:08:45] <acidjazz> works right
[10:09:44] <JAAulde> why is core 1.6.2 not on JSFiddle yet?
[10:10:13] <acidjazz> sukima: bah http://jsfiddle.net/qDBVX/1/
[10:10:18] <acidjazz> its working in jsfiddle
[10:12:11] <webBuilder> sukima, oh understood, Thank you :)
[10:12:40] <webBuilder> sukima, you are right, thank you, I'll try to see what is going on
[10:12:47] <sukima> acidjazz: Are you running this code inside of $(document).ready()?
[10:13:13] <acidjazz> sukima: no facebooks version
[10:13:18] <acidjazz> but i removed that and added it and that didnt help
[10:13:29] <bedspax> hi guys
[10:13:33] <bedspax> why this not work?
[10:13:38] <bedspax> $("#nuve").css('bottom','0px');
[10:13:40] <acidjazz> sukima: i sent you a link
[10:13:52] <sukima> And if you run that code only inside of a skeleton HTML page in IE9 it dies?
[10:14:29] <erichynds> bedspax: have you used firebug or webkit inspector to verify that the css rule isn't being applied to #nuve?
[10:14:42] <bedspax> wait
[10:15:29] <bedspax> yes is applyed
[10:15:39] <bedspax> but the div still remain block
[10:15:55] <bedspax> if i use top, work
[10:15:58] <erichynds> bedspax: try #css
[10:16:18] <acidjazz> hmm i think that might be hte issue sukima
[10:16:24] <acidjazz> facebooks document.ready
[10:16:26] <acidjazz> w/ IE9
[10:16:40] <bedspax> -.-
[10:16:47] <bedspax> if i use bottom:0 directly in the css, work
[10:19:17] <bedspax> diacan
[10:20:47] <jil> hello
[10:22:02] <erichynds> hello
[10:24:10] <jil> I beginning with jquery and I have tested some example from api.jquery.com. I don't get the following about events.
[10:25:08] <jil> $(event.target).is("li"); will not work but var $target = $(event.target); $target.is("li");  will?? why ?
[10:25:36] <sean`> ?doesn't work @ jil
[10:25:36] <bot-t> jil, What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[10:27:40] <jquerynewb> @necromancer $.get('/adv.php #manu', function(response) { $('#form').html(response); $('#manu').ajaxForm(options); }); doesn't seem to work...
[10:27:44] <sukima> Is there a list of useful cammands that bot-t  uses?

[10:28:06] <acidjazz> sukima: heres an intesteing thing
[10:28:14] <jil> well What I did is simply cut and past the last example from the api.jquery.com/target.event and replaced $target by $(event.targe).. and the example does work.  no error messages
[10:28:17] <acidjazz> when i put xxx.init() in a .ready() it works fine
[10:28:29] <acidjazz> but when i put it in a setTimeout() i get the same error object expected
[10:28:38] <acidjazz> sukima: like if its not run in its global scope or something..
[10:28:49] <acidjazz> ie9 says no to jquery
[10:29:10] <sukima> acidjazz: probubly because when the setTimeout definition is interperated the dom is not ready. You should put all your init inside a document.ready() to prevent missing dom objects
[10:29:43] <acidjazz> no inside a .ready INSIDE a setTimeout
[10:30:11] <sukima> jil: reproduce in jsfiddle so we can see what your seeing
[10:30:30] <jil> what's jsfiddle ?
[10:30:48] <sukima> acidjazz: yup and when the browser interperates the setTimeout definition (not when runing the setTimeout function) the diom isn't ready
[10:31:07] <acidjazz> why isnt it
[10:31:09] <acidjazz> its in .ready
[10:31:23] <sukima> acidjazz: you should define your setTimeout inside a document.ready() wrapper to garrentee your page has the whole dom loaded
[10:31:45] <acidjazz> IT IS
[10:31:53] <acidjazz> waddya mean a wrapper
[10:32:10] <acidjazz> $(document.ready(function() { setTImeout(function() { alert('lol'); }, 1000); });
[10:32:15] <acidjazz> document).
[10:32:22] <acidjazz> anywyas
[10:32:29] <acidjazz> thats not the solution i keep getting a zillion errors
[10:32:37] <acidjazz> object expected object expected all in IE9 only
[10:32:40] <acidjazz> all other browsers 100%
[10:32:54] <acidjazz> and all object expected errors are at jquery functions
[10:34:07] <jil> the full code of the exemple is: function handler(event){var target = $event.target; if($target.is("li")) { $target.children().toggle(); } }  $("ul").click(handler).find("ul").hide();
[10:34:22] <kborchers[A]> ?demo @ jil

[10:34:50] <jquerynewb> necromancer: erm... perhaps I'm just doing this wrong...
[10:35:32] <kborchers> jil: var target = $(event.target); then don't use $ in front of target
[10:37:11] <jil> they do sorry
[10:38:37] <jil> http://jsfiddle.net/36qDH/ is the full example.  very simple but I don't get the concept..

[10:42:28] <sonotos> acidjazz: well i mean when that makes a problem many pages will not work

[10:55:59] <b1lly> is there a way to bind 2 events to a funciton
[10:56:00] <b1lly> like
[10:56:17] <ajpiano> like $("foo").bind("click change", function(e) { })  ?

[11:07:29] <totallyvinny> howdy, is it possible to remove ui.draggable on an element once its dropped? im cloning the element btw
[11:09:06] <Rushing[away]> totallyvinny, the widget factory has a destroy() method
[11:11:31] <Rushing[away]> totallyvinny, i.e.: $(...).draggable("destroy")
[11:12:03] <totallyvinny> let me try it out
[11:12:40] <acidjazz> sonotos: latest ie9?
[11:13:10] <sonotos> acidjazz: well as late as ms had online
[11:13:24] <sonotos> just installed direct from the ms page
[11:13:46] <sonotos> acidjazz: have you some strange security settings or something?
[11:14:16] <sonotos> some corp browsers may have. on the other side, corp has no ie9
[11:14:35] <juha___> they sell canada dry in bottles? wooot
[11:23:55] <b1lly> is there a way to use the focus event to focus a text area between characters 23 and 24?
[11:24:39] <erichynds> no, it's more complicated than that

[11:30:05] <sonotos> acidjazz: as far as i know they have this tags, just google
[11:35:54] <b1lly> arrow keys dont count as keypress?

[11:57:18] <Swimming_bird> i'm going though the jquery code and trying to figure out how a jquery object is both an array and a custom object. can anyone help me out?
[11:57:58] <joshsmith> is anyone here familiar with the image picker used on Pinterest?
[12:00:03] <chovy> anyone have advice on how to build a page with ajax requests, but ensure the order of the widgets on the page are kept intact?
[12:00:12] <chovy> ie: widget1 displays before widget2.
[12:00:24] <chovy> i'm starting to set flags and crap.
[12:00:30] <daneroo> about jQuery Templates .. any way to invoke a named template with a varialble name ? {{tmpl "template-name"}} ->{{tmpl variableNamingTheTemplate}} ??
[12:00:35] <chovy> which is usually a sign I'm doing something wrong.
[12:01:25] <chovy> i think i know what to do now. nm.
[12:02:35] <blackwhite> I am trying to highlight the background of a form field when I select an input field http://000fff.org/taskmaster/
[12:02:40] <blackwhite> but nothing happens?
[12:02:55] <blackwhite> can't I use $('input').focus(function(){
[12:04:00] <erichynds> blackwhite: use CSS
[12:04:14] <erichynds> input:focus { background: red; }
[12:04:38] <blackwhite> but I want to do something a little more complicated though http://000fff.org/taskmaster/TODO.png
[12:04:48] <nahuel> does anyone uses ajaxForm ? It's bit strange, it add an handler on all my buttons, instead only the "type=submit" one... any idea ?
[12:05:10] <erichynds> blackwhite: it looks like a solid color to me
[12:05:41] <blackwhite> yeah but later on I will have to add a check box for items already created
[12:05:49] <blackwhite> when you roll over the list item
[12:06:01] <blackwhite> so I am thinking that I need jQuery for that no?
[12:06:55] <systemfault> Why would you need javascript for that?
[12:07:26] <blackwhite> erichynds like this http://000fff.org/taskmaster/TODO1.png
[12:07:31] <blackwhite> the top item
[12:07:36] <blackwhite> is when you are rolled over it
[12:07:41] <erichynds> that is a hover state on the list item
[12:07:45] <erichynds> which you can also do with css
[12:07:53] <blackwhite> hmm
[12:08:14] <blackwhite> so I can add a checkbox in css?
[12:08:25] <blackwhite> or are you saying make it invisible
[12:08:30] <blackwhite> and then show it?
[12:08:31] <erichynds> the latter
[12:08:33] <erichynds> yep
[12:08:35] <blackwhite> ahh ok
[12:08:37] <blackwhite> true
[12:08:43] <blackwhite> thnx

[12:25:15] <guy> how to distinguish click and drag events?
[12:25:32] <totallyvinny> Rushing: one more thing, using draggable is there a way to add a class to a dragged cloned element?
[12:25:35] <totallyvinny> on drop
[12:25:58] <erichynds> guy: if you have an event object, you can tell which it is with the "type" property
[12:27:13] <djQuery> erichynds: guy: I thought click didnt fire when dragging?
[12:27:38] <guy> well it seems like it does
[12:27:44] <erichynds> no idea
[12:27:49] <djQuery> for some stuff that I need to do for bot drag and click I bound to mousedown instead.
[12:28:25] <smplstk> guy: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/DhAuT/
[12:28:32] <smplstk> ^ like that
[12:28:39] <smplstk> IE what erichynds said
[12:28:47] <ericincoldohio> anyone familiar with a bug in the dialog ui control..where when I set it to modal everything is disabled on the entire page?
[12:29:20] <djQuery> ericincoldohio: errr thats the definition of modal
[12:29:37] <ericincoldohio> but even the stuff inside of the popup
[12:29:50] <ericincoldohio> entire page shades out, clicks disabled everywhere
[12:30:07] <djQuery> ericincoldohio: no havent seen that you probably got some bad html
[12:30:34] <ericincoldohio> hmm, i'll run it through some validators...works fine with modal is false
[12:30:41] <djQuery> ericincoldohio: here I am using it and the items arent messed up . http://jsbin.com/ucoquf/9/edit
[12:30:56] <djQuery> click on the edit button on orders for example
[12:31:18] <Snerf> looking for a zoom plugin that will allow me to zoom a div and its contents with +/- button, so I can zoom a page in and out. Thanks
[12:31:56] <djQuery> Snerf: ques ur users dont lick ctrl+mousewheel
[12:31:59] <smplstk> Snerf: it's called your browser
[12:32:08] <guy> smplstk: that gives click in both cases
[12:32:21] <smplstk> hrm? both cases?
[12:32:28] <ericincoldohio> demo you sent worked fine in firefox...blew up in my version of IE
[12:32:37] <djQuery> guy: only because the item is not draggable
[12:32:44] <Snerf> djQuery, no they dont
[12:32:54] <smplstk> yah, it was only set up/binded for click guy
[12:32:56] <naomi> what happened to the {"foo":1, "bar":2} version of $("form").serialize() ?
[12:32:56] <Snerf> smplstk, dumb users.. they dont know how
[12:33:07] <djQuery> ericincoldohio: what version?
[12:33:22] <smplstk> Snerf: is it just text that's zooming? or images and stuff too?
[12:33:28] <ericincoldohio> 7.0.5730.13
[12:33:45] <naomi> is it ok to do $.post(my_url, my_form.serialize(), callback, "json") ?
[12:33:56] <Snerf> smplstk, yes, text, images
[12:34:03] <smplstk> Snerf: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/YBBHC/
[12:34:08] <smplstk> GOOD LUCK WITH THE IMAGES BRAH
[12:34:13] <erichynds> naomi: I don't think $.post takes that 4th argument
[12:34:16] <erichynds> could be wrong though
[12:34:32] <Snerf> smplstk, ya, thats kind of useless.
[12:34:46] <mattp_> how do i localize a variable to inside a callback
[12:34:48] <erichynds> naomi: yep, i'm wrong. ur syntax should work fine
[12:35:01] <naomi> ok thanks
[12:35:01] <mattp_> so if it changes after the callback is created (but not triggered), it has the value at time of creation?
[12:35:28] <djQuery> ericincoldohio: yeah its blocking one of my required scripts because github sends it across as text
[12:35:28] <mattp_> i thought i could make a local copy (ie var this_foo = foo), but it seems to not be having the desired effet
[12:36:02] <ericincoldohio> probably wasn't the issue...at least same as mine
[12:36:31] <ericincoldohio> read some people said it happens if you had two dialog/modal setup on a page...i did...killed one...same sproblem
[12:39:06] <mattp_> foreach (id1 id2 id3) { $(#id).click(function() { do_something_with(id) }
[12:39:18] <mattp_> how do i stop id in the click callback from being all id3?
[12:40:20] <djQuery> mattp_: what the heck are u doing there?
[12:40:27] <kborchers> ?each @ mattp_
[12:40:27] <bot-t> mattp_, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[12:40:45] <smplstk> Snerf: what you're asking/looking for is kind of useless.
[12:41:07] <smplstk> programatically zooming images with JavaScript is going to look terrible.
[12:41:45] <djQuery> mattp_: .click(function(e){  e.stopPropogation(); e.preventDefault(); });
[12:41:47] <smplstk> and just plain a bad idea from an accessibility aspect.
[12:42:05] <mattp_> ignore my crappy pseudocode syntax heh
[12:42:16] <smplstk> like, imma zoom with this button, then imma zoom with the browser' controls
[12:42:18] <Snerf> smplstk, its not useless at all to what I want it for.
[12:42:19] <smplstk> OH NOES
[12:42:23] <mecode> Is there a simple way to get the url that the form *would have* submitted (if i didn't catch the submit event)? in other words, can i generate the get url from the form easily? or do i have to go through each input and add it manually?
[12:42:31] <Snerf> smplstk, well, thats your opinion'
[12:42:36] <Hierofant> GRRR.  Next computer I get is going to be a MAC.  screw this pc crap
[12:42:42] <Snerf> the answer "I dont know how" would have sufficed as well
[12:43:10] <smplstk> I gave you a pretty good starting point, actually, Snerf
[12:43:19] <djQuery> mecode: .attr('action')
[12:43:19] <Snerf> smplstk, hardly.. sorry
[12:43:28] <smplstk> >:|
[12:43:51] <Snerf> i'll keep on googlin, just thoguht I would ask here
[12:44:30] <magcius> hey guys
[12:44:53] <djQuery> Snerf: a lot of technical people dont say "it cant't be done" as they know that just about anything can be done. Heck a lotta times they even know off the top of thier how to do it. They just think its a realy bad idea.
[12:45:03] <naomi> erichynds: thanks
[12:45:05] <magcius> is there a list of good jQuery "best practices"?
[12:45:19] <fructose> I'm looking at an example that does "var $dialog = ...".  I'm new to using $ at the beginning of a variable. Is that a jQuery thing or JS thing? Is there a name I can use to Google?
[12:45:42] <magcius> fructose, it's a JS thing.
[12:45:44] <erichynds> fructose: just denotes the variable holds a jquery object
[12:45:46] <djQuery> magcius: its the same as javascript best practices.  cache your vars.
[12:45:52] <ajpiano> ?prefix @ fructose
[12:45:53] <bot-t> fructose, Attribute Contains Prefix Selector [name|="value"] - Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value either equal to a given string or starting with that string followed by a hyphen (-). http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-prefix-selector/
[12:45:54] <ajpiano> meh
[12:45:57] <erichynds> fructose: totally personal preference
[12:45:59] <ajpiano> ?$prefix @ fructose
[12:45:59] <bot-t> fructose, It is a common convention to prefix variables that refer to jQuery objects with a $ (Ex. var $this = $(this). The $ has NO SPECIAL MEANING and is simply customary among some developers. Others object to it on the grounds that it is "Hungarian Notation." Feel free to use it or not!
[12:46:27] <fructose> Ah, I see. Thanks!
[12:46:29] <djQuery> fructose: its just a naming convention. I try to name my var with a $ only when they are a jquery object
[12:46:35] <magcius> djQuery, would you mind helping me go over my code and make sure its up to snuff?
[12:46:55] <djQuery> magcius: $$$$$
[12:47:02] <magcius> djQuery, heheheheh.
[12:47:03] <mattp_> for (x = 0; x < 3; x++) { var foo = x; $("#bar").click(function() { do_something(foo) } ) }
[12:47:19] <monk12> Anyway to easily add a 'Clear' button to the jquery UI Datepicker?
[12:47:38] <djQuery> magcius: help you with an error FREE, review and rewrite\design $$$$$$$$
[12:48:06] <magcius> uh, well I'm having an error, but it's due to a bug in jQuery, and I already reported it
[12:48:07] <mattp_> how do i get foo to be called with the creation time value, not click time?
[12:48:16] <smplstk> wat
[12:48:36] <magcius> mattp_, that's a common JS gotcha.
[12:48:44] <magcius> mattp_, it's due to how JS does variables and closures.
[12:48:55] <mattp_> magcius: i understand :) i dont understand how to get around it though
[12:49:09] <bbrandon> how much faster would jQuery be if it dropped support for IE6?
[12:49:18] <magcius> bbrandon, none.
[12:49:26] <djQuery> $('bar').data('x', foo).click
[12:49:40] <djQuery> mattp_: easy workaround ^^
[12:49:42] <bbrandon> aren't smaller .js files faster/easier to parsE?
[12:49:52] <magcius> djQuery, you have bar tags in your code ? :)
[12:50:00] <magcius> bbrandon, parsing isn't a bottleneck.
[12:50:19] <djQuery> magcius: sure the original poster will get the gist of what I wrote
[12:50:48] <nahuel> does anyone uses ajaxForm ? It's bit strange, it add an handler on all my buttons, instead only the "type=submit" one... any idea ?
[12:50:49] <djQuery> magcius: well maybe if I had directed it at him
[12:50:58] <mattp_> djQuery: true! thanks :)
[12:51:00] <jtannenbaum> how would I after() something to the second-closest <tbody>?
[12:51:09] <jtannenbaum> of another thing
[12:51:15] <wookiehangover> anybody know if $.tmpl {{each}} supports looping through objects, like the API docs claim it too?
[12:51:48] <djQuery> jtannenbaum: see ?prevuntil
[12:51:49] <bot-t> jtannenbaum, .prevUntil([selector]): Get all preceding siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector. http://api.jquery.com/prevUntil/
[12:52:13] <djQuery> wookiehangover: yes it does
[12:52:26] <magcius> djQuery, are there any good references on JS "best practices" then?
[12:52:30] <mecode> djQuery: .attr('action') doesn't help with the parameters. I need to add the whole &var=1&something=else you know?
[12:52:39] <magcius> My code works, all I want to do is make sure that it will work with other people.
[12:52:44] <wookiehangover> djQuery: thanks for the confirmation
[12:52:56] <djQuery> wookiehangover: its common to juust go ahead and use {{tmpl() "templatename"}} much cleaner
[12:53:11] <ThiefMaster> hrm.. is there a good way to load a *full* html page, then take a part from that site and insert it on the current site **including** scripts?
[12:53:17] <ries> Gents, I want t respond to a onChoose event on this plugin : http://christsam.blogspot.com/2011/05/ccombo-v20.html?showComment=1309980733893#c1960823094878278589 However, how do I do that? I am clueless! If you know a doc about events I would appreciated it. THis doesn't seem to work var Combos.get_combo('myselection').onChoose(function()....
[12:53:22] <ThiefMaster> (so .load() with a selector after the url doesn't work)
[12:53:29] <magcius> also, do jQuery's Deferreds support Twisted (or Dojo/MochiKit)-style deferred chaining?
[12:53:52] <djQuery> mecode: what are u trying to accomplish? could it be there is allready something that does what you are trying to do? see ?g malsup form
[12:53:53] <magcius> that is, returning a deferred from a callback waits on that deferred?
[12:53:53] <bot-t> mecode, jQuery Form Plugin - jQuery Plugins by malsup - http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[12:54:26] <ajpiano> magcius, there is Deferred.chain
[12:54:29] <djQuery> ThiefMaster see ?get
[12:54:29] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[12:54:41] <magcius> ajpiano, that's not what I asked
[12:54:43] <djQuery> ?$.get
[12:54:44] <bot-t> djQuery, jQuery.get() - Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[12:55:05] <djQuery> ThiefMaster: think that returns the whole thingabob
[12:55:10] <ThiefMaster> djQuery: i tried using $(response).find('body')
[12:55:17] <Carraway> random freelance web developer question - if you're builing and hosting a site for a client, how are the payment logistics handled for the server costs? like if it costs $10 a month to host the server, how is that recurring cost passed on to the client?
[12:55:22] <ThiefMaster> $(response) seems to be a jquery object with a ton of elements
[12:55:27] <ThiefMaster> instead of just one top-level html element
[12:55:49] <djQuery> Carraway: send them a bill for $120
[12:55:50] <ajpiano> magcius, sorry.  i am not exactly up to speed on that style of chaining.
[12:56:05] <ries> Carraway: I would offer them a yearly maintenance package of a couple of hunderd $
[12:56:30] <Carraway> interesting. so it would essentially be an ongoing bill, for however long their site is hosted with you
[12:57:36] <ries> Carraway: yes, I wouldn't get bothered with 10usd/month income and all the effort it takes to keep the server safe and up and running. Besides that, if you charge yearly then you keep in contact with your customers
[13:05:23] <mecode> i'm using the form plugin - i set my target to '#target-div', and this element then has an entire new page put inside it. i just want the '#target-div' from the new page to be put into it. ideas?
[13:06:07] <ericincoldohio> I would just send them a $100 bill a month and say it includes 1 hour of dev time
[13:06:14] <ericincoldohio> can't accomplish anything in an hour anyways
[13:19:04] <mecode> I'm using the jquery form plugin, I need to get a div by id (e.g. '#my-div') out of "responseText". how do i do that? I tried something like $(responseText).filter('#my-div'). Ideas?
[13:21:05] <kborchers> mecode: can't you just rewrite the page that processes your form so that it only outputs the content you want to put in the div?
[13:22:04] <mecode> kborchers: not as easily, it just seems like i should be able to update the div easily using jquery
[13:26:30] <djQuery> grrr ui.position gives me issues every time I try to use it. .position({my: 'top right', at: 'top left', of: $(this).closest('tr')});
[13:27:49] <SpaceghostC2C> I'm trying to get the value of an img tag's src based on if the radio button it's next to is the selected one and then insert that value into a separate form in a hidden field.

[13:28:34] <mystic414> Hello, I was wondering if there is a defined behavior for when .val(value) tries to set the value on a select element but the value isn't a valid option.  For instance, if there is a select of colors "red", "blue", "green" and i try to set it to "" (not a valid option)
[13:28:54] <SpaceghostC2C> I need to take the value I set in the hidden field in the asset_list form and set the value in the text field below the "step" type.
[13:28:59] <lenswipe> hey guys
[13:29:25] <mystic414> firefox selects the first option, "red", but safari freaks out and no longer includes the select in a future .serialize()

[13:34:37] <mystic414> kborchers: thanks, glad to see people are aware of it!
[13:34:41] <ries> djQuery: to what line in that example are you revering to?
[13:35:25] <djQuery> grrr why si this not not postioning correctly $coleditbuttons.css({'position': 'absolute', "z-index": 6}).position({my: 'top right', at: 'top left', of: this});

[13:38:49] <moo-_-> min|dvir|us: also encodeURIComponent()
[13:38:51] <moo-_-> or something like that
[13:39:13] <djQuery> ries: I am probably confused with all the messages
[13:39:24] <ries> Ahh.. ok, np....
[13:40:03] <djQuery> gues I will just use the postion option to move it over.
[13:41:02] <gg77> hi everyone. I want to deserialize a query string of the form a=1&a=2&a=3 into an array of [1,2,3] to select options in a listbox using val(). need help in doing the deserialization part
[13:51:08] <djQuery> well that didnt work if I resize the table the item becomes even more messed up. http://jsbin.com/ucoquf/14/edit#preview
[13:51:09] <SpaceghostC2C> I'm trying to get the value of an img tag's src based on if the radio button it's next to is the selected one and then insert that value into a separate form in a hidden field. I keep getting problems with objects instead of strings or something usable. http://76.115.243.133:3000/teacher/courses/1/edit#
[13:51:20] <SpaceghostC2C> I need to take the value I set in the hidden field in the asset_list form and set the value in the text field below the "step" type.
[13:51:35] <djQuery> notice that if you rezise the table the edit buttons get offset incorrectly
[13:52:55] <solidus-river> if i dont want to put the jquery at the end of my document, is there a way to have it not start or attempt to initiate or link itself with dom object until after the body is loaded?
[13:53:03] <solidus-river> i moved some script to the top of the page and everything broke
[13:53:07] <djQuery> SpaceghostC2C: see ?.next
[13:53:08] <bot-t> SpaceghostC2C, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[13:53:20] <solidus-river> but i'd prefer to keep it at the top during development
[13:53:22] <SpaceghostC2C> djQuery: What does that have to do with it?
[13:54:12] <gg77> does jquery provide a way to deserialize query parameter ?a=1&a=2&a=3 to [1,2,3] array?
[13:55:46] <djQuery> SpaceghostC2C: well this is a multipart thing there.
[13:55:56] <djQuery> get the checked radio
[13:56:12] <djQuery> $(':radio:checked');
[13:56:28] <djQuery> get the image after it. .next('img')
[13:56:42] <djQuery> get the src value .attr('src')
[13:56:44] <SpaceghostC2C> djQuery: I have the checked radio and I get the next element which is an image, I get the src attr of the image, now I need to put that into the other form's content field.
[13:56:46] <djQuery> stick it somewhere
[13:57:09] <gg77> djQuery: any help would be appreciated
[13:57:11] <SpaceghostC2C> Now you're where I am. How?
[13:57:13] <djQuery> $('#myhiddentinput').val(x);
[13:57:48] <kborchers> gg77: just use split on &, then loop through and split on = and build your array. pure js no nQuery necessary
[13:57:50] <SpaceghostC2C> I don't think we're on the same page here.
[13:57:58] <djQuery> gg77: same here got an answer for my ui.position issue?
[13:58:38] <SpaceghostC2C> I'm getting that I can't use object, when I'm expecting to be able to use the selector I built to get the content field and put the value of the img's src attribute.
[13:58:53] <gg77> kborchers: i want the opposite of $.param .. You mean I will have to write the js logic
[13:59:44] <ch3mical> Does anyone have a link to a very simple iframe upload example? All I want to see really is what is minimally necessary.
[13:59:49] <gg77> djQuery: i must have missed your question on ui.position. Can you clarify?
[14:00:32] <kborchers> gg77: yes just write it yourself. can be done in about 4 or 5 lines
[14:01:36] <ch3mical> All I've been finding are plugins to use as an example
[14:02:27] <gg77> kborchers: do you have the code handy? I have looked into the code of some deserialize plugins which are abandoned now and do not work with array query params, but rather return only the last value of a=1&a=2&a=3
[14:03:30] <SpaceghostC2C> djQuery: http://76.115.243.133:3000/teacher/courses/1/edit If you check the console log, you'll see what I'm doing. I fixed it to show the problem clearly.
[14:03:59] <SpaceghostC2C> Is it how I'm trying to select the right element?
[14:05:03] <kborchers> gg77: not handy but i told you how. just split() qstring on &, loop through that array and split each element on =, then add the second element in that array (your value for the param) to an array you defined outside of both loops. when done, you have an array of the values
[14:05:13] <SpaceghostC2C> djQuery: I get the name of the form field I want, but I'm not sure how to take that and select that field to put the value into.
[14:05:55] <gg77> kborchers: ok thanks, I will try this
[14:08:24] <solidus-river> anyone have a method that lets jquery go at the top instead of the bottom, i think the issue is that I'm attaching my jquery to objects in the body, but the jquery is getting loaded first so it has nothing to attach itself
[14:08:58] <djQuery> SpaceghostC2C: the name or the id?
[14:09:18] <SpaceghostC2C> djQuery: It can be either, but I was using name.
[14:09:35] <djQuery> $('input[name="'+ somename +'"]).val(x);
[14:10:27] <D-Roch> Hi, I would like to know if it's possible to wait until the load action is finished to start my "init() function" : here is the code I'm using:  $('#window-content').load(url+' #main-content', init());
[14:11:20] <djQuery> ajpiano: got any idea what I am doing wrong with ui.position? http://jsbin.com/ucoquf/15/edit
[14:12:05] <jacof> So... I want to make a FadeIn News Scroller for the last 3 stories... what's the best way to do that? I don't want it to break if there's only one story, or two.
[14:12:34] <ajpiano> djQuery, try my: "right top" instead of "top right"
[14:13:05] <djQuery> ajpiano: thanks
[14:13:44] <djQuery> ajpiano: .position needs a callback for when its done with a bool for wether it was flipped or not
[14:13:54] <gg77> kborchers: http://jsbin.com/uqerox/4/edit
[14:14:00] <ajpiano> hm :/
[14:14:56] <djQuery> that would solve the discussion that was going on where menu which way to show the arrow.
[14:15:23] <djQuery> in this case I would want to remove ui-corner-left and add ui-corner-right
[14:15:41] <ajpiano> if you hack it in, you could suggest it as a pull req
[14:15:43] <ajpiano> that's what i would do
[14:16:02] <djQuery> ajpiano: I will take a look at it but was kinda thinkin out load
[14:16:05] <djQuery> loud
[14:16:30] <ijkm> how much sense does it make that an ajax GET returns OK even though the function set doesn't even exist in the backend
[14:17:10] <kborchers> gg77: that worked exactly as it should. you did not specify that your string would also contain the page and ? if that is the case, do one more split on the ? and then start the rest with the element after the ?
[14:17:21] <jacof> nothing ?
[14:17:25] <gg77> kborchers: ok
[14:17:34] <totallyvinny> using jquery ui droppable is there a way to assign a class "dragged" to the element? im cloning the dragged element
[14:17:52] <gg77> kborchers: are you seeing live updates as I make changes inside jsbin?
[14:18:19] <kborchers> gg77: no you would have to send the new saved link
[14:18:46] <gg77> kborchers: ok.
[14:18:51] <SpaceghostC2C> How would I get and set an attribute for a given selector?
[14:19:03] <kborchers> ?attr @ SpaceghostC2C

[14:19:06] <SpaceghostC2C> attr("name").val("value")?
[14:19:20] <SpaceghostC2C> kborchers: Don't I also need val for setting?
[14:19:36] <djQuery> totallyvinny: yes look at the drop event.  .droppable({ drop: function(event, ui){ ui.item.addClass('dropped'); }})
[14:19:42] <kborchers> SpaceghostC2C: no, .attr("name", "val")
[14:19:48] <SpaceghostC2C> kborchers: Oh, thank you.
[14:20:18] <djQuery> totallyvinny: you might need to look and see what ui is as I dont thik its ui.item now that I think of it
[14:21:07] <djQuery> SpaceghostC2C:  .attr('name', val)
[14:21:22] <djQuery> disregard
[14:21:44] <SpaceghostC2C> http://76.115.243.133:3000/teacher/courses/1/edit If you click image, then select a radio button, and click the link, this shows up in the log: Uncaught Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #[object Object]

[14:32:40] <jacof> (one more try) So... I want to make a FadeIn News Scroller for the last 3 stories... what's the best way to do that? I don't want it to break if there's only one story, or two.
[14:32:44] <djQuery> ajpiano: ques it needs more than a boolean that it was flipped it would need an object with each cords to tell which was flipped   flippers = {top: true, left: false, bottom: false, right: false} dangit. little more complicated than I thought the pugin was now that I look at it.
[14:33:12] <ajpiano> yea for real
[14:43:19] <mecode> how do i correctly attach a click() event with elements received through ajax? right now, every time things are refreshed, the elements have more click events attached and fire 4 or 8 times.
[14:44:10] <solidus-river> does jquery run before the dom is done loading?
[14:44:12] <solidus-river> or does it wait
[14:44:22] <solidus-river> i'm attaching it to dom elements, will that cause conflict or not
[14:44:26] <ch3mical> mecode: see ?stoppropagation
[14:44:26] <bot-t> mecode, event.stopPropagation(): This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/

[14:44:34] <bot-t> mecode, event.stopImmediatePropagation(): Keeps the rest of the handlers from being executed. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopImmediatePropagation/
[14:44:44] <systemfault> solidus-river: Sure it does.
[14:44:56] <systemfault> solidus-river: That's why jQuery has a .ready function
[14:45:04] <solidus-river> systemfault: so how do i make sure i dont attempt to run before
[14:45:10] <ch3mical> solidus-river: see ?ready
[14:45:11] <bot-t> solidus-river, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[14:45:23] <systemfault> Yeah ;) .ready is the answer

[14:48:08] <ch3mical> equivoc: or see ?slidetoggle
[14:48:09] <bot-t> equivoc, .slideToggle([duration], [callback]): Display or hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[14:49:16] <ch3mical> You can bind the latter to a "mousein mouseout" event
[14:49:17] <equivoc> hmm
[14:50:04] <ch3mical> And you can add fading with see ?fadein
[14:50:05] <bot-t> .fadeIn([duration], [callback]): Display the matched elements by fading them to opaque. http://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/
[14:50:16] <ch3mical> And fadeout on mouseout
[14:51:08] <jeffmess> long shot, is there a jquery method/plugin that will animate a div moving above all it's siblings?
[14:51:27] <equivoc> ch3mical: thx, will try that
[14:51:53] <ch3mical> jeffmess: see ?animate
[14:51:53] <bot-t> jeffmess, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[14:51:57] <Edler2> hey guys
[14:52:06] <Edler2> if i have var x = $("#mydiv")
[14:52:16] <Edler2> how can i get, using x, the 2nd div that is a child of #mydiv
[14:52:17] <Edler2> ?
[14:52:31] <ch3mical> Edler2: x[2] ?
[14:52:54] <Edler2> no no
[14:52:55] <ch3mical> x is an array of jQuery objects, so as long as there is more than one, you can access it like any other array
[14:52:56] <Edler2> let me pastebin
[14:53:24] <jeffmess> thanks. will take a look into it.
[14:53:53] <ch3mical> If you want to use that element again as a jQuery object, you have to $() it, so $(x[2]).hide() for instance
[14:54:06] <ch3mical> And not x[2].hide()
[14:54:25] <Edler2> http://pastebin.com/eeyEyzk1
[14:55:07] <ch3mical> Though for what you're doing, you should probably just see ?nth
[14:55:08] <bot-t> ch3mical, :nth-child() Selector - Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[14:55:24] <ch3mical> Edler2: or see ?eq
[14:55:25] <bot-t> Edler2, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[14:55:52] <Edler2> ah got it
[14:55:54] <ch3mical> $("mydiv").eq(2).remove() for instance
[14:55:57] <Edler2> $("div:nth-child(2)").remove() ?
[14:56:11] <Edler2> didn't know about nth-child, thanks anyhow :D
[14:56:17] <ch3mical> Yeah, depending how your are selecting
[14:56:20] <ch3mical> you*
[14:56:46] <Edler2> no
[14:56:53] <Edler2> in my case i don't want to use $("...
[14:56:56] <Edler2> i want to use x
[14:56:59] <Edler2> so x.find(...
[14:57:11] <ch3mical> x.eq(2) ?
[14:57:28] <Edler2> no but x is the main container
[14:57:39] <Edler2> how can i select the 2nd child that is a div
[14:57:46] <ch3mical> x.children('div').eq(2) ?
[14:57:49] <Edler2> inside x
[14:57:52] <Edler2> ah
[14:57:53] <Edler2> thanks :D
[14:58:12] <ch3mical> np
[15:01:07] <ch3mical> Also, FYI: x.children('div:nth-child(2)') would do the same, and might save a tiny bit of overhead, since it won't process the selection twice
[15:01:54] <ch3mical> Negligable, really, unless you are running that function hundreds of times
[15:04:09] <blueadept> quick opinion, does this code look ugly? http://pastie.org/private/7zildoppgyqmu2ofajovjw
[15:04:42] <blueadept> is the logic solid? or am i over doing it?
[15:04:49] <Edler2> it's good
[15:04:50] <Edler2> BUT
[15:04:54] <Edler2> you can change few stuff
[15:05:03] <Edler2> first
[15:05:07] <Edler2> in the last 2 lines
[15:05:08] <Edler2> instead of:
[15:05:09] <Edler2> }
[15:05:09] <Edler2> 	offerNavSelect()
[15:05:10] <Edler2> just put
[15:05:10] <devinrolsen> Hey, I'm using a simple $.get request to gather the name of a value from a large select box. The request sends back a string but when I try to assign this string ($.get('the url',function(data){somevar = data})), I get told this var is an object and not a string.
[15:05:13] <Edler2> }()
[15:05:15] <blueadept> ah
[15:05:20] <Edler2> also
[15:05:21] <blueadept> that's right
[15:05:21] <Edler2> instead of
[15:05:29] <Edler2> var offerSelects = ['#whatSelect', '#whereSelect', '#whenSelect', '#priceSelect', '#photosAndVidsSelect', '#confirmSelect']
[15:05:30] <Edler2> put
[15:05:34] <Edler2> var offerSelects;
[15:05:36] <Edler2> offerSelects = ['#whatSelect', '#whereSelect', '#whenSelect', '#priceSelect', '#photosAndVidsSelect', '#confirmSelect']
[15:05:54] <Edler2> same for hasClass
[15:06:01] <Edler2> ; = $(this).hasClass('Selected').toString()
[15:06:04] <Edler2> i mean
[15:06:07] <Edler2> var hasClass;
[15:06:10] <Edler2> hasClass = $(this).hasClass('Selected').toString()
[15:06:16] <blueadept> ah ok
[15:06:21] <ch3mical> Edler2: why?
[15:06:31] <blueadept> yeah just wondering, why so?
[15:06:31] <Edler2> better practice : javascript hoisting
[15:07:00] <Edler2> to avoid potential bugs
[15:07:05] <Edler2> first define all your vars
[15:07:10] <Edler2> on line 1
[15:07:14] <Edler2> then assign them later
[15:07:20] <blueadept> cool, i see
[15:07:21] <Edler2> var x,y,z...
[15:07:27] <Edler2> because if you dont
[15:07:32] <Edler2> that's what the compiler will do anyway
[15:07:33] <blueadept> i've seen that kind of notation before i think
[15:07:34] <ch3mical> Oh, I see what you're saying. You weren't very clear at all ;)
[15:07:42] <Edler2> haha
[15:07:44] <Edler2> hope now it's clearer
[15:07:46] <blueadept> hey thanks elder2 for the tips
[15:07:51] <Edler2> keep it up
[15:07:53] <Edler2> you're welcome
[15:08:09] <ch3mical> blueadept: also define all your vars on one definition ;)
[15:08:59] <Edler2> ch3mical: what do you mean ?
[15:09:13] <ch3mical> var blah1, blah2, blah3; not var blah1; var blah2; etc
[15:09:38] <Edler2> yup (Y)
[15:12:54] <fructose> Is there a way to "share" a variable or call a function in different windows/tabs? I'm writing a logout modal dialog and would like all of them to close when any one closes
[15:18:34] <gg77> kborchers: do you know a way where one can construct a function parameter from a variable name? lets say I have a function JasonsPets and I pass tommy and jimmy as variables to JasonsPets. Can I reference them as JasonsPets.jimmy.fetch() ?
[15:19:12] <gg77> anybody?
[15:36:44] <ekkis> hei everyone.  I have a plugin development question. could someone take a look? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6591247/plugin-method-declarations-cant-make-it-work
[15:36:53] <aaairc> http://jsfiddle.net/tMT6C/2/    ---- I'm trying to have it so when "clickMe" is clicked the first time, it shows "foo", but when "clickMe" or anything else on the page EXCEPT "foo" is clicked, "foo" is hidden.
[15:37:56] <aaairc> so far I have it so that when "clickMe" is clicked, "foo'" appears. And when the "document" is clicked, foo disappers... the only thing not working, is when "clickMe" is clicked a second time... it doesn't cause "foo" to go away
[15:38:16] <aaairc> Any suggestions? that initial link... http://jsfiddle.net/tMT6C/2/ ... shows what i'm talking about
[15:39:09] <ekkis> aaairc: so keep state in a variable

[15:40:30] <aaairc> ekkis: could you demonstrate with that jfiddle example? not sure what you mean.
[15:40:52] <ekkis> aaairc: you could look to make sure that foo isn't showing before clickMe does anything

[15:42:30] <aaairc> ekkis: awesome thanks!
[15:42:41] <ekkis> does it do what you wanted it to?
[15:43:33] <aaairc> ekkis: checking it out
[15:44:49] <ekkis> ThiefMaster: when you call $.ajax() the success handler receives a parameter with the contents of the page - which you can then assign to your div's .html() - the javascript in the page should automatically run
[15:44:59] <aaairc> ekkis: yeah this should work. thanks again!
[15:45:13] <primepie> if I have a plugin that I want to apply on elements that gets created some time later when a user loads html using an ajax call .. what's the proper way of doing it in jquery..
[15:45:23] <ThiefMaster> ekkis: as i wrote, the response contains the whole html page
[15:45:37] <ThiefMaster> and if i select just the correct div the script inside that div aren't executed
[15:46:19] <ekkis> so you make the selection and then assign that to a div?
[15:46:30] <ekkis> upon calling the .html() with stuff, scripts execute
[15:47:00] <primepie> anyone ? :)
[15:47:24] <ThiefMaster> ah maybe it didn't work because i used .replaceWith?
[15:48:49] <ekkis> ThiefMaster: I'd need to see code.  I don't know what you're doing but as I said, calling .html() with stuff will execute scripts within

[15:50:06] <Anticom> http://pastebin.com/3RZf5DSH
[15:50:30] <Anticom> when exactly is success being fired?
[15:50:57] <Anticom> firebug is telling me, that i got a response from the server but somehow the console.log success doesn't appear =/
[15:51:02] <ekkis> Anticom: when the method is succcessfully called
[15:51:04] <Anticom> and the actions are not taking place
[15:51:14] <ch3mical> Anyone know why selecting a form by it's ID does not work with .serialize?
[15:52:05] <ch3mical> $('form').serialize() works, but not $('#myform').serialize()
[15:52:07] <ekkis> Anticom: you want to call .html() on json?
[15:52:28] <Anticom> ekkis: ??
[15:52:39] <Anticom> it's for debug output... i'm returning a sql-query
[15:54:30] <Anticom> ekkis: oh wait... dataType is the return type?
[15:54:45] <Anticom> i want to send JSON but return "plain" html
[15:54:50] * ekkis thinks... maybe not
[15:55:06] * Anticom doesn't get it
[15:55:07] <ch3mical> Yes, datatype is the response type
[15:55:10] <ekkis> Anticom: yes
[15:55:12] <Anticom> ch3mical: thanks
[15:55:21] <Anticom> and how do i specify, that i'm sending json?
[15:55:25] <Anticom> or is there no need?
[15:55:27] <ch3mical> If you leave it out it will auto-detect
[15:55:28] <ekkis> I rarely use it because mostly it guesses for me
[15:55:31] <ekkis> right
[15:55:39] <ekkis> auto-detects so I wasn't sure
[15:55:46] <ch3mical> You don't have to specify what you send

[15:59:46] <ekkis> always end up calling by hand
[16:00:11] <ekkis> primepie: oh, wait... you can use a DOM event
[16:00:15] <ekkis> hang on...
[16:00:16] <primepie> ekkis: is there an event in the dom that I can add like <div onload ?
[16:00:45] <ekkis> yes
[16:00:48] <ekkis> looking
[16:00:59] <ekkis> my browser crashed yesterday and I lost the tab I had that on
[16:01:11] <primepie> bcz if that's possible I don't mind calling the plguin from there and passing this to it
[16:01:20] <mecode> if i have an element <p> , how can i add a span around the words that are not the first, say, 40 words? So like <p>word1 word2 ... word40 <span class="extra">word41 ... word 213</span></p>
[16:01:49] <ch3mical> mecode: see ?wrap

[16:06:35] <ekkis> I have to run but maybe you could make a notation there?
[16:06:39] <phishbot> is it not appropriate to look for javascript/jquery consults here?
[16:06:43] <ekkis> I can't seeem to get it to work
[16:06:56] <phishbot> consultants*
[16:07:14] <ekkis> phishbot: I'm sure it's fine
[16:07:49] <phishbot> okie in that case ... looking for a jquerymobile or canvas developer to help with a few projects.  developer here overwhelmed w/ workload and need some help.
[16:08:04] <phishbot> if you're interested please pm me :D
[16:08:49] <mecode> ch3mical: still not clear on what to do, split the <p> element? if i put a limit, it will just return the first 40 words. wouldn't i need to get all but the first 40 words?
[16:09:38] <primepie> ekkis: create an object and use this... {first_name: 'myname', get_name: function () { return this.first_name}} ... when a function is inside an object this is apply-ied to it
[16:09:43] <ch3mical> Get the text from the <p> and split on spaces, for as many words as you want (40?), then wrap each in whatever you want and replace the contents of <p>
[16:17:44] <primepie> is there an event in dom that allows me to do <div onelementindom="" > .. basically to know when the  element got inserted into the dom
[16:19:53] <Anticom> is there something special my php-script has to send back at the end, so that the ajax-object detects, that data submission is over now? because when i don't have firebug active, the result doesn't show up; if i got it active it does
[16:29:16] <joshsmith> can jQuery fetch the size of an img if there's no width/height specified in the HTML

[16:38:27] <initself> $("div.subcategory_list checkbox").change(function() {
[16:38:40] <initself> can someone modify the selector so that it isn't retarded?
[16:38:54] <initself> do i need to name/class/id each checkbox?
[16:39:45] * initself thinks maybe a form tag is needed.
[16:40:26] <joshsmith> I'm trying to use clientWidth and clientHeight on img DOM elems but they're undefined
[16:40:29] <joshsmith> any thoughts?
[16:41:19] <drd> joshsmith: on load ?
[16:41:34] <joshsmith> on doc ready
[16:42:03] <drd> if they don't have an explicit heigh/width then you'll need to do it on load
[16:43:10] <joshsmith> so ready won't work?
[16:43:32] <drd> nope, since they're getting the height&width set from the external resource, which isn't guaranteed until load
[16:43:53] <joshsmith> alright, I've never used onload within onready; how can I do that?
[16:43:54] <initself> hrm
[16:43:54] <initself> $("input[type='checkbox']").change(function() { alert("here"); });
[16:43:59] <initself> doesn't seem to do anything
[16:44:28] <joshsmith> initself: isn't there some weird checkbox:checked thing you have to do?
[16:44:33] <drd> input[type=checkbox], don't think you want the quotes
[16:44:34] <joshsmith> I think it's non-obvious, if I remember right
[16:45:11] <Segaja> if i have an img in a link tag and define a .click() on the link i always get the img as target of the click if i check e.target
[16:45:20] <joshsmith> drd: should I be doing $(window).onload()?
[16:45:23] <Segaja> is there some easy way to get the link without using .parent() ?
[16:45:30] <joshsmith> or .load() rather?
[16:45:36] <drd> joshsmith: yep
[16:45:55] <joshsmith> drd: alright, bear with me as I check this
[16:47:18] <joshsmith> drd: erg. it's still undefined
[16:47:24] <drd> hrm
[16:47:33] <joshsmith> I know it's doing it onload this time because I had another console.log() event
[16:47:38] <joshsmith> and it's now happening after the other
[16:47:48] <initself> i'm trying!
[16:47:53] <initself> nothing's stickin'!
[16:48:07] <drd> joshsmith: what if you poke at it from the console?
[16:48:42] <joshsmith> drd: how so?
[16:48:52] <joshsmith> bear with the stupid :p
[16:49:03] <drd> $('img')[0].clientWidth or similar?
[16:49:26] <drd> from your javascript console?
[16:50:08] <joshsmith> hmm the first works, the ID I have set doesnt...
[16:50:52] <drd> make sure your selectors are working first :)
[16:51:24] <joshsmith> this is odd, it really should be working
[16:51:51] <joshsmith> when I do $('#image') in the console I get this output:
[16:51:53] <joshsmith> [
[16:51:54] <joshsmith> <img id=‚Äã"image" src=‚Äã"http:‚Äã/‚Äã/‚Äãtctechcrunch.files.wordpress.com/‚Äã2011/‚Äã07/‚Äãfbskype1-e1309977645900.png?w=234">‚Äã
[16:51:54] <joshsmith> ]
[16:51:58] <joshsmith> so it's the img object, alright
[16:52:06] <joshsmith> shouldn't that have a clientWidth?
[16:52:09] <drd> and $('#image')[0].clientWidth ?
[16:52:14] <joshsmith> that works fine
[16:52:23] <Glutnix> quick thought: unit testing jquery ui drag and drop?
[16:52:44] <drd> you need to deref the the wrapped set -- $('#image') is not the <img> it's a [<img>]
[16:52:45] <joshsmith> I've got images in a carousel so I've been doing $('#carousel img').each()
[16:53:03] <joshsmith> ahh, so how do I do that?
[16:53:19] <drd> the [0]
[16:53:32] <drd> but in your each, this should be the <img> element right?
[16:53:36] <joshsmith> gotcha
[16:53:40] <joshsmith> I got it now
[16:53:59] <joshsmith> so when I'm looping through and I reference them, I should be doing $(this)[0]
[16:54:03] <joshsmith> that's non-obvious to me
[16:54:22] <drd> no, you just do this.clientWidth
[16:54:28] <joshsmith> I thought that referencing an img would point to the <img>
[16:54:44] <drd> is that not working?
[16:55:31] <joshsmith> no it is working
[16:55:33] <joshsmith> what I said
[16:56:55] <joshsmith> thanks
[16:58:49] <drd> cool, np
[16:59:51] <joshsmith> yeah, this is epic
[17:00:02] <joshsmith> this is way better than what I was planning to do server-side
[17:00:20] <joshsmith> I've got a cool little carousel image picker
[17:00:33] <joshsmith> so given a URL, I fetch all the images greater than 50px from that site
[17:00:40] <joshsmith> and allow you to pick one for a photo upload
[17:00:59] <joshsmith> it's similar to FB's link preview
[17:01:37] <SkyFlyer>  question.  I'm setting a variable like this:   var color = "rgb(0, 123, 123)";   But when I alert it, it's missing the spaces in the middle between the 0 123 and 123 ?  why? how to I make sure it keeps those spaces ?
[17:05:33] <rewt> those spaces don't get removed for me -- http://jsfiddle.net/ekh3y/

[17:11:25] <Guest59233> Hi there, are there any developers here?
[17:11:44] <James13433> how do I update a custom attribute such as data-zoomsrc ?
[17:12:18] <James13433> I tried .data('zoomsrc', 'imagesrc.jpg') but has no effect.
[17:12:29] <b0x> $(selector).attr(...
[17:12:43] <b0x> http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[17:12:54] <James13433> I tried that too had no effect
[17:13:47] <James13433> jQuery('#image').attr('data-zoomsrc', 'image-src.jpg'); should work right?
[17:14:01] <mystline> does anyone know of an jquery upload script that supports unique file names out of the box?
[17:14:15] <kborchers> James13433: if your image's id is image, yes
[17:14:34] <mystline> I am using uploadify at the moment but I haven't quite been able to sort it out.
[17:14:39] <James13433> well it doesnt... just the src attribute update works fine however
[17:15:35] <kborchers> James13433: hmmm see ?demo
[17:15:36] <bot-t> James13433, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:17:02] <drd> is there any way to know when all the event handlers have finished processing for an ajax request?
[17:17:13] <drd> or rather, for all ajax requests?
[17:17:31] <James13433> ahh, seems it doesnt update the data-src just not the acctual thing using that data-src
[17:18:28] <mystline> drd: $.ajaxComplete()?
[17:19:03] <drd> mystline: complete fires after the handlers?
[17:19:24] <mystline> oh, sorry i misread.
[17:19:24] <yannis008> Hi there, I figured out what is going on in regards to ticket #5445 I just added a comment with a test case there. However, this ticket has been closed as worksforme 9 months ago. I thought I will let people know here since I don't know how to go about making sure someone will see my comment on the ticket.
[17:19:42] <mystline> i thought you meant the ajax call(s) itself.
[17:19:52] <SpaceghostC2C> $("form input[name=" + $('#asset_list form input[type=hidden]') + "]").attr("value", asset_url); I can't seem to get the middle selector to work. I keep getting an object.
[17:20:13] <drd> mystline: yeah, it's for functional testing in selenium, need to know when we're done modifying the DOM
[17:20:31] <mystline> my bad, goodluck i have no idea in regards to that C:~
[17:22:14] <kborchers> SpaceghostC2C: that's because that selector would return a jQuery object containing all selected elements. if you know there is only one, you should be able to just say $('irc://irc.freenode.net/#asset_list form input[type=hidden]')[0] i believe
[17:22:45] <kborchers> SpaceghostC2C: but you need the jQuery object to do attr
[17:23:52] <kborchers> which would come from the first selector so that should work, though that's the entire element so instead you probably need $('irc://irc.freenode.net/#asset_list form input[type=hidden]').attr("name") for the middle selector
[17:24:41] <kborchers> sorry for the paste issue, my client replaced your selector with a link to a room
[17:24:51] <scorphus> how are your development pace with jQuery compared to the pace with the dynamic language you're using?
[17:25:13] <scorphus> in terms of achievement...
[17:25:45] <SpaceghostC2C> kborchers: http://76.115.243.133:3000/teacher/courses/3/edit#
[17:25:50] <SpaceghostC2C> That's what I'm working on.
[17:26:10] <scorphus> I tend to work way too much on jQuery to achieve the same "amount of job done" than with the scripting language behind the scenes (PHP, mostly)
[17:26:38] <scorphus> I mean, I work more with jQuery than anything else
[17:26:57] <scorphus> how about yourselves?
[17:27:11] <`teh1> what's the correct event to use for selecting different options in a select tag?
[17:27:22] <`teh1> i.e. if the option is changed i want to handle that
[17:27:57] <SpaceghostC2C> It won't set the hidden field correctly. I'm getting an object from asset_selector_callback
[17:30:13] <puddy> Hi, I'm trying to do an instant ajax search thing on my page. The problem I'm having is clearing the results after each keyup (I can easily get it to append the results). Here's some of the code: http://jsfiddle.net/CvVGp/
[17:30:31] <kborchers> SpaceghostC2C: to be honest, there is so much going on there that it is hard to try to trace through it to your problem
[17:33:25] <SpaceghostC2C> kborchers: Yeah. It's pretty messy at the moment. I just have to get it done really quick and then clean itup.
[17:36:06] <SpaceghostC2C> kborchers: The problem is getting the attribute_selector_callback to return the id of the correct hidden field and then selecting it.
[17:40:21] <kborchers> SpaceghostC2C: so wouldn't that just be var asset_selector_callback = $("#asset_list form input[type=hidden]").attr("id");
[17:45:10] <kborchers> SpaceghostC2C: looking at your source though, it looks like #asset_list just has an empty form in it so it shouldn't find anything
[17:47:37] <SpaceghostC2C> kborchers: I figured it out.
[17:47:57] <kborchers> puddy: have you thought about using ui's autocomplete? see ?autocomplete
[17:47:57] <bot-t> puddy, jQuery UI - Autocomplete Demos & Documentation - The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. Here the suggestions are tags for programming languages, give "ja" (for Java or JavaScript) a try. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[17:48:17] <kborchers> SpaceghostC2C: good to hear
[17:49:36] <puddy> kborchers: no i haven't considered that.. interesting.
[17:50:21] <kborchers> puddy: yeah, you can tell it to append the results to that same ul you are using, and it does all of the appending and clearing for you
[17:50:54] <kborchers> and it should take your json as input as well
[17:52:02] <puddy> jeese, jquery and it's spinoff projects are so powerful
[17:52:13] <kborchers> yep ;)
[17:52:51] <puddy> i'll look into that fix though, thanks a bunch
[17:53:44] <jcapelo> hello im looking for help on how to create JSON request with jquery
[17:57:34] <kborchers> ?getJSON @ jcapelo
[17:57:35] <bot-t> jcapelo, jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [callback]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[17:58:04] <joshsmith> is there any easy way to listen for the enter key and a blur simultaneously (on an input)
[17:58:26] <joshsmith> my use case is to do some fancy AJAX magic when a user enters a URL into an input on a form
[17:58:45] <joshsmith> so they may blur by moving onto another form element, or they may hit enter to fetch results first
[17:59:08] <joshsmith> right now I'm just binding to the blur but not listening for the key
[17:59:15] <kborchers> joshsmith: so you want both events to do the same thing?
[17:59:23] <joshsmith> kborchers: yes, exactly
[18:00:41] <kborchers> you can just do .bind("keyup blur", function(event) { ... });  inside the function, detect which event it is, then if it's keyup, check for enter key
[18:01:06] <joshsmith> ah yeah I was wondering if that would be that easy
[18:01:15] <joshsmith> how do you detect which event it is inside the fn?
[18:01:48] <kborchers> since you pass in the event, you should just be able to check event.type
[18:02:05] <joshsmith> or would it be easiest to check e.keyCode?
[18:02:37] <joshsmith> oh but that wouldn't catch the e.type if it wasn't a keyup
[18:02:46] <joshsmith> it would just fire on anything that's not the enter key
[18:03:09] <kborchers> are u using jquery ui at all or just jquery?
[18:03:47] <joshsmith> I'm using UI but is it necessary here?
[18:04:11] <joshsmith> I'm just going to do an if(e.type == 'blur') {} elseif(e.type == 'keyup' && e.keyCode == 13) {}
[18:04:31] <joshsmith> oh wait
[18:04:31] <kborchers> u would want to check type to make sure it was keyup or blur, just execute code if blur then if keyup, check keycode
[18:04:33] <joshsmith> that's dumb
[18:05:19] <ekkis> I can't quite get the syntax right for a jquery plugin method declaration... could anyone look? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6591247/plugin-method-declarations-cant-make-it-work
[18:05:58] <kborchers> i asked about ui cuz i believe you can use $.ui.keyCode.ENTER to check for enter which is more human readable than 13, but that's just a personal preference ;)
[18:06:29] <joshsmith> kborchers: this make sense?
[18:06:29] <joshsmith> http://pastebin.com/rg7cernz
[18:07:29] <kborchers> i think so, though you could probably just return rather than return false if you won't be checking for false later
[18:08:08] <joshsmith> oh, really?
[18:08:16] <joshsmith> ha, another thing I never realized
[18:08:26] <kborchers> again just a clean code thing, return false will work just fine
[18:09:53] <joshsmith> yeah but never realized return will work just the same way
[18:10:09] <joshsmith> although return false is more readable to me for some reason
[18:10:11] <joshsmith> it makes more sense
[18:10:23] <joshsmith> to me it reads as "this isn't what we're looking for"
[18:10:30] <joshsmith> but whatever
[18:10:48] <kborchers> to each his own ;)
[18:12:10] <joshsmith> thanks though
[18:12:15] <ekkis> kborchers: hei, could you take a quick look at my question?  I'm not getting much traction on it: DOMNodeInserted
[18:12:33] <ekkis> sorry, here's the link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6591247/plugin-method-declarations-cant-make-it-work
[18:13:32] <kborchers> ekkis: i haven't done much plugin work but let me se
[18:13:34] <kborchers> see
[18:13:54] <ekkis> it might be a simple thing.  I just can't quite figure it out
[18:19:04] <Prometheus> lol, http://encosia.com/jquery-1-6-2-syntax-error-you-may-be-the-victim-of-seo/
[18:19:09] <Prometheus> "This is why we can‚Äôt have nice things"..
[18:19:34] <Prometheus> damnit google :/
[18:23:07] <ekkis> Prometheus: what an interesting idea for hacking into websites... distribute your own copy of jquery where you get to write whatever you'd like
[18:23:29] <Prometheus> better check those plugins that bundle jquery ;)
[18:25:26] <ekkis> kborchers: I figured it out
[18:25:30] <ekkis> will post answer on SO
[18:25:46] <kborchers> ekkis: cool, i was trying a few things but didn't get anywhere
[18:26:13] <ekkis> I know it's possible to do because I've done it before but as I keep playing with patterns I couldn't figure out what did the trick
[18:26:30] <ekkis> this is really neat cuz it allows you to do $('whatever').myMethod()
[18:26:35] <ekkis> real clean
[18:27:46] <joshsmith> kborchers: you do any regex at all?
[18:28:07] <kborchers> joshsmith: sure whatcha tryin to find
[18:28:08] <jcapelo> this is what i got so foar and its not working
[18:28:09] <jcapelo> http://pastebin.com/AcCeAntm
[18:28:51] <ekkis> kborchers: posted
[18:28:54] <joshsmith> kborchers: http://pastebin.com/EiSW0CW2
[18:28:58] <joshsmith> just wondering what you think of that
[18:29:06] <joshsmith> hobbled it together from a couple different things I found
[18:29:13] <joshsmith> did a little testing and it works nicely so far
[18:37:15] <kborchers> joshsmith: here is the one i use. i think it's a little more thorough. it is used in the jquery validate plugin and the regex was contributed by scott_gonzalez, the lead for jquery ui http://pastebin.com/qgnwQnu1
[18:37:30] <joshsmith> oh wow
[18:38:24] <joshsmith> that's a beast
[18:44:20] <kborchers> yeah, i honestly can't even trace my way through that let alone write it. :D
[18:44:31] <kborchers> gotta go, happy coding
[19:11:07] <thinkster> I am using a site template called Wing the Air on http://www.csstemplatesfree.org/page/7 and well the slider it has is using jcarousel and works good, except when I edit it, all of a sudden, without notice, the last slide goes blank.  And I started all over and did all my edit again, but couldn't recreate the problem.  And then I went back to my first template edit, and the problem somehow just disapeared, and today, I did some more edits
[19:11:07] <thinkster> and it back again.  It is rediculous
[19:22:09] <joshsmith> I have a weird issue
[19:22:36] <joshsmith> I'm accessing the clientWidth/clientHeight of <img>'s
[19:22:48] <joshsmith> which requires the img's to be fully loaded in the client's browser
[19:23:02] <joshsmith> but I'm trying to do this after an AJAX complete
[19:23:16] <joshsmith> I'm not sure how to check for load in this circumstance
[19:23:19] <joshsmith> any thoughts?
[19:44:04] <Anticom> i've got a table and i want to add tr's in the middle of it
[19:44:07] <Anticom> how can i do that?
[19:44:58] <systemfault> Anticom: See what you can do with insertBefore and insertAfter
[19:44:58] <ekkis> Anticom: .after()
[19:45:16] <systemfault> Yeah, or after()
[19:45:19] <Anticom> thanks
[19:46:05] <amites> Any ideas why a button bind would be denied access to self.parent when loaded inside a frame?
[19:46:28] <amites> Or more specifically any ideas how to get around such a situation?
[19:46:41] <joshsmith> any ideas as to my question above?
[19:47:10] <ekkis> joshsmith: .load()
[19:47:20] <joshsmith> my one thought is to maybe do a setTimeout and poll every 10 seconds to see if everything accords
[19:47:28] <ekkis> it makes sure your images are loaded
[19:47:38] <joshsmith> ekkis: but this is with JSON
[19:47:48] <ekkis> what is?
[19:47:53] <joshsmith> hold on, let me pastie
[19:49:31] <joshsmith> ekkis: http://pastebin.com/RV2RM9BQ
[19:50:06] <joshsmith> I get back JSON from the AJAX call, and then I loop through that
[19:50:31] <joshsmith> and after that's complete, I do $(window).load() to resize the images
[19:50:48] <joshsmith> and that's where I'm accessing clientWidth, etc.
[19:51:18] <ekkis> joshsmith: oh, I see... I think you can do $('#myimage').ready()
[19:52:26] <joshsmith> ekkis: I don't have any IDs on those images though
[19:52:41] <joshsmith> and I have to resize after each and every one has loaded
[19:53:10] <joshsmith> I mean I was thinking that long polling could accomplish the same feat
[19:53:16] <aaairc> hello all... I'm having a positioning issue with the following example http://jsfiddle.net/XPS9K/ . When the "hiddenBox" appears, I want it to appear relative to where I have scrolled in the browser. So if I scroll down, and I click a "showBox" div, the "hiddenBox" should appear fully within my view, without me having to scroll up to see it.
[19:53:37] <ekkis> joshsmith: it would be better to do this kind of thing: var img = $('<img />', { src: '...' });
[19:53:39] <aaairc> do I need to do some sort of jQuery trick to set the position of the box, at the time of the click event?
[19:53:41] <joshsmith> just keep a count of the number of JSON objects (images) and then continually try to resize the images until they're all loaded
[19:53:48] <ekkis> then you can do things like img.ready(function() {});
[19:54:03] <aaairc> thanks and here is the example again:  http://jsfiddle.net/XPS9K/
[19:54:24] <joshsmith> ekkis: in place of the .append()?
[19:55:00] <aaairc> ekkis: this question is actually building on what you helped me with earlier
[19:55:10] <ekkis> no, once you have the image created you can .append(img)
[19:55:55] <joshsmith> gotcha, but that img.ready(resizeCarouselImages()) will work fine for $.each()?
[19:56:12] <ekkis> joshsmith: see: http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[19:56:35] <ekkis> there's a discussion there on caveats of the even when loading images
[19:56:44] <ekkis> so it's not .ready() but .load()
[19:57:24] <phishbot> anyone know where i can find a Javascript implementation of AES 128bit encryption?
[19:57:38] <ekkis> joshsmith: as long as your .each() gives you images
[19:57:50] <phishbot> can't find a decent script
[19:58:00] <ekkis> aaairc: let me look...
[19:58:13] <joshsmith> ekkis: let me try this out real fast
[19:59:04] <ekkis> aaairc: so what's your question exactly?
[19:59:56] <ekkis> aaairc: you shouldn't have all those <br/>s in there... just set the margin-bottom of the class
[20:00:15] <ekkis> e.g. .showBox { margin-bottom: 5em; }
[20:00:35] <gurumelo> aaairc: position: fixed ?
[20:00:40] <versatiletech> ok so who needs help?
[20:00:58] <aaairc> ekkis: so if i scroll down on the page, and click a button to show my hidden div, i don't want the hidden div to appear at the top of the page, making me have to scroll to the top of the page to see the hidden div. Instead, I want the hidden div to appear where I'm currently viewing
[20:03:55] <SpaceghostC2C> versatiletech: I need help procuring alcoholic beverages.
[20:04:15] <versatiletech> over 21?
[20:04:18] <ekkis> aaairc: your problem is that .hide() actually sets display: none
[20:04:28] <ekkis> so what you really want to do instead is set visibility
[20:04:34] <aaairc> ekkis: its like i want position:fixed set the position... and based on that, have it switch over to position:absolute, so its attached to the page in that specific position and it doesn't continue to stay relative to the browser if I then scroll up or down.
[20:04:43] <ekkis> setting the display to none takes it out of the flow
[20:05:12] <ekkis> it's really like removing it from the DOM
[20:05:23] <ekkis> but the hide will hold the space, just not show you the element
[20:06:43] <RingZer0> does anyone else have issues getting IE to do _ANY_ visual callbacks (slidein/out fadein/out) ?
[20:07:13] <joshsmith> ekkis: with what you're saying, how do I nest that img tag inside an <li>?
[20:08:39] <joshsmith> nvm I figured it out
[20:09:28] <versatiletech> RingZer0: I just did a fadein/out on a project and it worked so so
[20:09:33] <ekkis> joshsmith: $('<li />').append(img);
[20:10:09] <joshsmith> ekkis: thanks, I did it another way, but now the resizing doesn't seem to be working
[20:12:07] <gdakram> hey guys, i'm running into some serious road blocks in attempting to loading and applying a jquery plugin via jsonp. is this just generally a very idea?
[20:12:23] <gdakram> very *bad* idea?
[20:12:54] <gdakram> every once in a while I would get jquery is being slow or unresponsive alert on the browser
[20:14:40] <RingZer0> versatiletech: http://www.nextlevelathlete.com/july-showcase-registrataion/
[20:14:49] <RingZer0> it works in all browsers except IE
[20:15:23] <RingZer0> just suppose to be fadeOut() ... change content, ... fadeIn()
[20:17:41] <versatiletech> looks like the fadeout works
[20:17:46] <versatiletech> fadein isn't
[20:18:14] <versatiletech> oh and it's Registration ;)
[20:18:19] <versatiletech> type
[20:18:21] <versatiletech> typo*
[20:18:35] <versatiletech> brb
[20:19:08] <RingZer0> haha
[20:19:09] <RingZer0> thanks
[20:21:50] <aaairc> ekkis: I tried changing everything over to "visibility" here:  http://jsfiddle.net/XPS9K/6/   but the hidden div never seems to appear now. Also, in terms of "display:none", I'm not sure if I see the issue in taking the div out of the flow of the page. That is what I actually want when it is hidden (I think)... I don't want it to affect the position of anything else on the page. Its just when I click to make it visible, I want the
[20:21:51] <aaairc> position to be position:absolute where the "top" attribute dynamically changes at the time the hidden div is made visible based on the current position of the scroll bar.
[20:23:51] <ekkis> aaairc: if you take something out of the flow of the page it will affect the positioning of everything downstream
[20:25:31] <ekkis> aaairc: I dont' quite get what you're trying to do
[20:25:53] <ekkis> what's the sequence of events?  what shall I click on and what do you expect me to see?
[20:26:15] <aaairc> ekkis: sorry for the explanation if its convoluted. am going to try and type the sequence more clearly.
[20:26:53] <ekkis> aaairc: also, .toggle() doesn't take those kinds of arguments.  see syntax: http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[20:27:10] <aaairc> ekkis: k
[20:28:07] <sphinxxx> anyone here know jquery slideviewerpro plugin?
[20:28:26] <sphinxxx> cannot figure out why the slideshow here is not aligned correctly: http://www.nautiandco.com/look
[20:28:58] <versatiletech> k back
[20:30:04] <ekkis> sphinxxx: I haven't used it... I see the issue
[20:30:16] <versatiletech> sphinxxx: how should it look like?
[20:31:17] <sphinxxx> versatiletech, you'll notice the slides are overlapping
[20:31:25] <sphinxxx> and the thumbnail is cut off on the right
[20:31:42] <ekkis> aaairc: I'm going to sit to dinner... ttfn
[20:31:51] <ekkis> you can PM if you like
[20:32:02] <versatiletech> styles.css (line 1231)
[20:32:10] <versatiletech> change to padding: 0;
[20:33:29] <aaairc> ekkis: k thank you
[20:33:54] <aaairc> ekkis: am typing out the sequence so hopefully it makes sense, and will send it in prob 3 minutes or so over PM
[20:34:16] <versatiletech> RingZer0: works fine in IE7 and IE8
[20:36:39] <Anticom> how can i add the attribute "selected" to an option-tag?
[20:36:47] <Anticom> will attr('selected') work?
[20:37:17] <versatiletech> i think it's attr('selected','selected')
[20:37:35] <thinkster> do web browsers automatically remember scroll position.  Like when you scroll down a page and hit a link and then hit back it return to the same scroll position.  Does this feature need to be coded or is it default browser behavior?
[20:38:18] <rogeruiz> thinkster: In my experience I think it's default behavior. Though I believe it only works one page deep.
[20:38:20] <sphinxxx> versatiletech, whats the element that needs padding 0?
[20:38:34] <versatiletech> go to that line
[20:38:53] <thinkster> rogeruiz, thx
[20:39:00] <rogeruiz> Oh wait. thinkster actually
[20:39:06] <rogeruiz> Im thinking refresh
[20:39:24] <thinkster> I'm pretty sure it is default behavour
[20:40:40] <rogeruiz> I don't know how reliable it would be. I would be hesitant to make it a feature of the site.
[20:46:50] <rogeruiz> thinkster: If you're targeting a modern browser you could think of storing the $(window).scrollTop()
[20:47:16] <rogeruiz> Using localStorage

[20:53:43] <jcapelo> this is what I have so far for JSON jquery request
[20:53:47] <jcapelo> but its not working
[20:53:48] <jcapelo> any thoughts
[21:02:09] <versatiletech> try $.ajax
[21:09:45] <thinkster> thanks to all the help I recieved in this channel and some of my own efforts, I may become a web site designer soon
[21:10:44] <thinkster> its like free college with out all the train rides and buses and traffic, and tests and deadlines
[21:20:53] <sphinxxx> versatiletech, you still here?
[21:21:05] <sphinxxx> line 1231 in styles.css refers to something else
[21:21:56] <versatiletech> sphinxxx: what's the link again?
[21:22:25] <sphinxxx> http://www.nautiandco.com/look
[21:26:15] <versatiletech> http://pastebin.com/DX01qMRK
[21:27:04] <lil-murph> $('table.trackeditems > tbody').delegate('tr', 'click', function(e){ alert('lol');  });
[21:27:07] <lil-murph> Not sure why that's not working
[21:27:24] <lil-murph> i click the table and nothing. (obviously it's a silly thing to do and the alert is not the actual end goal)
[21:31:16] <sphinxxx> versatiletech, hmm that seemed to halfway fix it
[21:31:34] <sphinxxx> thumbnails are fixed but images still overlapping
[21:32:15] <Anticom> when i fire $('.vor').attr('disabled', 'true'); i get <input type="button" class="zurueck" disabled="disabled">
[21:32:20] <Anticom> what am i doing wrong?
[21:32:28] <sphinxxx> if i nspect the <li> tags that make up that slideshow, they are not lining up to the edges
[21:37:30] <sphinxxx> versatiletech, so strange, the first two images are aligned perfectly, then on the third it starts to disalign
[21:39:01] <versatiletech> sphinxxx: the images don't have the same width
[21:39:04] <versatiletech> that's the problem
[21:40:12] <sphinxxx> wow one image is longer so it messed up everything after that
[21:40:16] <sphinxxx> can't believe I missed that
[21:40:17] <sphinxxx> thanks:)
[21:44:04] <lil-murph> how do i use jquery to select the text in a cell (select as in as though i'd highlighted it with the mouse)
[21:46:04] <joshsmith> ekkis: you back around?
[21:47:35] <aaairc> does anyone know how to get the scroll offset of a page... so if i scroll down, the number of pixels from the top of the page to where the page is actually visible in my browser?
[21:47:53] <joshsmith> thinkster: congrats!
[21:48:24] <Anticom> doesn't anyone know how to disable a button in js? =/
[21:48:25] <thinkster> joshsmith, thx
[21:48:35] <tbranyen> ?scrollTop @ aaairc
[21:48:35] <bot-t> aaairc, .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[21:48:49] <thinkster> Anticom, onclick and then just leave it empty
[21:49:04] <Anticom> thinkster: ??
[21:49:11] <thinkster> the button
[21:49:21] <Anticom> --> $('#selector').onclick() ??
[21:49:37] <joshsmith> thinkster: I spent basically a year in this and other channels, reading some books, and coding away
[21:49:38] <thinkster> Anticom, let me check the site, think thats it
[21:49:48] <joshsmith> thinkster: and now I have a job as a lead developer!
[21:49:51] <thinkster> joshsmith, me too
[21:50:13] <joshsmith> 75k for basically no background
[21:50:21] <Anticom> there is no onclick in jq afaik
[21:50:22] <thinkster> joshsmith, well, my success is little more modest, I just got a couple of small time gigs
[21:50:23] <joshsmith> so seriously, keep at it
[21:50:37] <thinkster> joshsmith, thx, you too
[21:50:47] <thinkster> Anticom, there is something like that, let me look it up for you
[21:51:10] <joshsmith> $('#selector').bind('click', function() {});
[21:51:10] <thinkster> Anticom, oh, its just click()
[21:51:21] <joshsmith> yeah, shorthand for the above
[21:51:37] <Anticom> you kidding me? click is the onclick event handler and it's not disableing the button in any way
[21:51:54] <joshsmith> you need to write extra code to disable it
[21:51:59] <joshsmith> click won't disable anything
[21:52:01] <Anticom> i simply want to set the disabled attribute using attr(), but it doesnt work
[21:52:02] <joshsmith> on its own
[21:52:16] <Anticom> joshsmith: [06:32] <Anticom> when i fire $('.vor').attr('disabled', 'true'); i get <input type="button" class="zurueck" disabled="disabled">
[21:53:11] <joshsmith> you should really use attr('disabled', 'disabled'), but that looks like that's working
[21:53:25] <joshsmith> I'm not sure what you're concerned about
[21:54:20] <joshsmith> oh wait
[21:54:27] <joshsmith> your classes are messed up
[21:54:45] <joshsmith> the button you're talking about has the class zurueck and you're firing on class vor
[21:55:09] <joshsmith> still don't have the full context of what you're doing, but check your selectors
[21:55:22] <aaairc> bot-t: i tried using that, but i'm a little confused by it. Here you can see my attempt http://jsfiddle.net/tudGg/ .
[21:55:25] <bot-t> aaairc, Couldn't find "i tried using that, but i'm a little confused by it. Here you can see my attempt http://jsfiddle.net/tudGg/ ." in jQuery Docs.
[21:55:37] <joshsmith> aaairc: bot-t is a bot
[21:56:14] <aaairc> joshsmith: ok... first time i've ever encountered that... new to IRC
[21:57:05] <Anticom> aaairc: what you want to do?
[21:57:10] <aaairc> tbranyen: here is my attempt... http://jsfiddle.net/tudGg/ . I'm a little confused by it. I don't want to do .scrollTop() on a selector... i just want it for the entire page.
[21:57:25] <tbranyen> aaairc: wat
[21:57:39] <tbranyen> aaairc: use $(document).scrollTop()
[21:58:18] <joshsmith> aayeah, you're doing the scrollTop() for the first element
[21:59:08] <aaairc> tbranyen: thanks... the $(document).scrollTop() seems to be what i want
[21:59:11] <joshsmith> aaairc: http://jsfiddle.net/tudGg/3/
[21:59:32] <aaairc> joshsmith: thanks!
[22:00:02] <joshsmith> also, just keep in mind, you're doing function(e) but you're not using the event handler
[22:00:10] <joshsmith> it'd be easy enough to just leave it as function()
[22:00:20] <joshsmith> if you're never going to make use of that handler
[22:00:31] <ekkis> aaairc: I'm back... did you figure out your issue?
[22:00:32] <tbranyen> aaairc: np
[22:00:32] <aaairc> joshsmith: k thanks
[22:00:32] <joshsmith> super super minor
[22:00:37] <Anticom> i'm freakin out >.>
[22:00:40] <aaairc> ekkis: yeah i think so
[22:00:46] <ekkis> ok.  cool
[22:00:53] <aaairc> i was also trying to figure out how to have a function that fires every time the user scrolls
[22:01:02] <Anticom> why won't .attr('disabled', true) work for inputs?!
[22:01:10] <joshsmith> ekkis: I tried doing the per-image .load() but it still wasn't working
[22:01:14] <aaairc> would it just be $(document).scrolls(function(){...})?
[22:01:15] <joshsmith> I did something else that's kind of a hack
[22:01:41] <ekkis> joshsmith: TBO, I've never used it.  there are warnings on the jquery page about cross-browser issues
[22:01:50] <Anticom> aaairc: http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[22:02:06] <joshsmith> ekkis: yeah at this point I'm just long polling until every image is loaded and I've resized them
[22:02:15] <joshsmith> and then I clearInterval()
[22:02:26] <ekkis> I've had issues with that before
[22:03:20] <joshsmith> I've used it before in a number of instances and have never run into an issue
[22:03:25] <joshsmith> this is really pretty simple
[22:03:39] <joshsmith> basically if an image hasn't loaded the clientWidth will be 0
[22:03:41] <ekkis> joshsmith: usually you can just wrap your code in $(document).load() instead of .ready() but since you're loading the images dynamically, the .load() would be the solution
[22:03:53] <joshsmith> so if it is, I set var images_loaded = false
[22:04:15] <ekkis> I struggled with that issue months ago and did eventually solve it but I can't remember how
[22:04:25] <joshsmith> and in the interval I set it to true again, so if you loop through the images to resize them and have no 0 clientWidths
[22:04:29] <joshsmith> then it'll clear the interval
[22:04:36] <aaairc> Anticom: cool. i tried that earlier, but i must have typed something wrong because its working for me now when i do $(document).scroll(function(){});
[22:04:42] <ekkis> yeah, it's an eeky solution but it will do
[22:04:42] <joshsmith> usually it only takes two loops to be finished
[22:05:06] <Anticom> aaairc: get an IDE with jq code support
[22:05:13] <joshsmith> yeah, I mean, luckily it's all client-side processing anyway
[22:05:26] <joshsmith> if I was doing that bullshit on the server I'd be a lot more upset
[22:05:46] <joshsmith> you can see it in action here http://goals.com/imagejquery.php
[22:06:26] <ekkis> joshsmith: oh I see... so I get to upload an image
[22:06:41] <joshsmith> yeah you can't actually upload now
[22:06:54] <joshsmith> but you either pull all the large images from a website
[22:07:00] <joshsmith> (try techcrunch.com for example)
[22:07:08] <joshsmith> and then carousel through them to pick the one you want
[22:07:12] <joshsmith> or upload your own photo
[22:07:13] <aaairc> Anticom: do you have a recommendation? I'm using Eclipse right now, and installed the Aptana 2.0 plugin to get jQuery code-assist, but am not very happy with it. I'm using the play! framework, and the Aptana 2.0 HTML editor gives me errors whenever i put a play! template tag inside my jQuery code, so that basically makes the error checking of the editor useless for me.
[22:08:06] <Anticom> aaairc: if you want to spend some money, buy phpDesigner7
[22:08:15] <Anticom> that's what i'm using atm and i'm quite happy with it
[22:08:43] <Anticom> of course it doesn't support you with option-objects for configuring stuff and it doesn't have jq ui support
[22:08:54] <Anticom> but it supports the basics of all major js frameworks
[22:10:45] <aaairc> Anticom: ok i'll check it out. i'm not doing any php coding if that affects anything. i'd also be willing to pay a good amount for an IDE if its gonna save me time.
[22:11:23] <aaairc> Anticom: the reason i'm using eclipse is because the play! framework is java based... but am new to all this stuff so don't know what else is out there.
[22:12:04] <Anticom> phpdesigner doesn't support java afaik
[22:12:20] <Anticom> sorry, yes it does
[22:13:42] <aaairc> Anticom: k
[22:15:12] <SkyFlyer> this might be a stupid question but im tired...  I am binding a click to a href, that calls function();  But function(){} is actually in the footer and the click bind is in the header.  Do i need to put the function(){} above the bind click?  the issue is that im doing it in doc ready.  I thought the click would find the function no matter where on the page ? yes not?
[22:17:02] <Anticom> i've got a question about scopes http://pastebin.com/5Y2kw5iE
[22:17:31] <Anticom> although i declared the variable in a global scope (i suppose at least) i can only access it's value inside the success-method
[22:17:38] <Anticom> how can i fix that?
[22:18:53] <sprezzatura> so i have this expand/collapse region - when the page loads i have the div collapsed and i make  an ajax call to get the data. but , i dont want to reload the data when teh user toggles again. how can i check the div from again making an ajx call when it expands?
[22:20:24] <Anticom> sprezzatura: how about only fiering ajax on $(document).ready()?
[22:20:38] <Anticom> and not on toggle()
[22:20:50] <sprezzatura> Anticom: wouldnt that load when the page loads?
[22:21:03] <Anticom> sure
[22:21:09] <Anticom> when do you want it to load?
[22:21:11] <sprezzatura> Anticom: i have a few divs in the page and i dont want them to load unless user requests for it. these are expensive queries.
[22:21:45] <sprezzatura> Anticom: so, only when the user expands the divs. and only once in a page(though if he navigates away and again comes back to teh page and then expands the div..then it can happen again)
[22:22:18] <Anticom> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/ then i simply would store something like loaded = 1 if it loaded once and then simply only load, if not loaded yet
[22:22:49] <djQuery> isnt this the correct way to pass optional items to a template? $('#tbltmpl').tmpl(scheme.Tables, {"tbltmplIndex": -1})
[22:23:56] <mohi666> I have a page with thumbnails of multiple image. What's the best jquery photo gallery plugin to show all the images in their actual size?
[22:23:58] <sprezzatura> Anticom: thanks. does the data persist for session?
[22:24:00] <sprezzatura> will dig
[22:24:05] <djQuery> keep getting tbltmpIdenx is undefined
[22:24:24] <Anticom> sprezzatura: think so
[22:24:26] <Anticom> not sure
[22:24:28] <Anticom> read doc
[22:24:29] <djQuery> sprezzatura: not it doesnt persist
[22:24:41] <djQuery> any page reload and it will be gone
[22:24:53] <Anticom> djQuery: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.tmpl/ doc says it's beta, maybe there's some kind of bug or issue
[22:25:12] <djQuery> Anticom: yeah I am familar
[22:25:20] <djQuery> http://api.jquery.com/template-tag-equal/
[22:25:33] <sprezzatura> djQuery: am fine with that then
[22:26:03] <Anticom> djQuery: did you append the output to anything?
[22:26:04] <djQuery> sprezzatura: not saying that you couldnt store it in a cookie
[22:26:21] <Anticom> or a session variable^^
[22:26:34] <djQuery> Anticom: http://jsbin.com/ucoquf/23/edit
[22:27:06] <djQuery> Anticom: sprezzatura: you would need to do some kinda post to save it to a session varable
[22:27:37] <djQuery> not that it would be hard. as you are probly doing a post\get to get the expensive data
[22:28:00] <sprezzatura> hmm. let me dig
[22:28:41] <Anticom> djQuery: do you know, how i can't access my variable in a global scope?
[22:29:11] <Chibby_> does anyone know if there's something like the children() method that will get all the children, then the children of those children, the children of those, etc.?
[22:29:28] <Anticom> http://pastebin.com/hKG49BgV
[22:29:47] <Anticom> Chibby_: how about .children().children().children() ?
[22:30:06] <Anticom> oh no sorry
[22:30:12] <Chibby_> was thinking of the situation where you don't know how many levels of children there are
[22:30:14] <Anticom> .children().each() [...]
[22:30:29] <djQuery> Anticom: your 2nd alert is being fired before the ajax finishes
[22:31:16] <djQuery> and damn I hate alert. see ?ftjq
[22:31:17] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[22:31:22] <Anticom> okay so everything happening below should be in the success callback?
[22:31:31] <joshsmith> Anticom: use console.log()
[22:31:44] <Anticom> i am usually
[22:31:45] <djQuery> Chibby_: you could do an old fashioned while loop
[22:32:17] <djQuery> Chibby_: or just a self refrenceing function
[22:32:45] <Chibby_> hmm, i'll try that out, thanks
[22:36:24] <SkyFlyer> next question.  when I need to use php inside javascript should it do it like this...   var side = "<?php echo $side; ?>";
[22:41:12] <djQuery> dont know php but thats basicaly how I do it in asp\.net
[22:42:31] <j_wright> as long as $side is appropriately escaped
[22:48:11] <sushi4664> hi, i have run into a weird problem...where i'm trying to hide something when something comes to focus. i have the following code:  $(inputArr[0]).focus(function() {                 $(inputToOverlayDict[inputArr[0]]).hide();             });
[22:48:34] <sushi4664> where inputArr holds what needs to be clicked and inputToOverlayDict holds what needs to be hidden
[22:48:39] <sushi4664> thats all fine and dandy
[22:48:44] <sushi4664> but if i put it in a for loop
[22:48:50] <sushi4664> it doesn't do anything
[22:48:51] <sushi4664> help?
[22:49:14] <jcapelo> I want to do json request this is what i got so far but it doesnt work
[22:49:16] <jcapelo> http://pastebin.com/AcCeAntm
[22:54:53] <sprezzatura> Anticom: djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/XJvQ3/
[22:55:04] <sprezzatura> doesnt seem to work right with the data part...can you peek?
[22:55:11] <djQuery> sushi4664: maybe if you put together a demo we could tell u how to do it wouthout a loop. see ?demo
[22:55:12] <bot-t> sushi4664, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[22:56:10] <Anticom> sprezzatura: jQuery.data( element, key, value  )
[22:56:15] <Anticom> you forgott an argument
[22:56:23] <djQuery> sprezzatura: sure ould be better if you could use .toggle instead
[22:56:41] <djQuery> ?ui.accordion
[22:56:41] <bot-t> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[22:56:53] <sprezzatura> Anticom: not quiet.check
[22:57:05] <Anticom> you're not even writing some data
[22:57:21] <Anticom> and what's line 6?
[22:57:21] <sprezzatura> Anticom: check 6th line
[22:57:26] <Anticom> line starts with {
[22:57:32] <djQuery> sprezzatura: in the accordion doc there is a demonstration of doint just what u are working on
[22:57:37] <Anticom> which would be an json object
[22:57:58] <sprezzatura> basically, check whether the div has a data associated with it. the data basically tells whether the div was expanded or not
[22:58:17] <Anticom> gotta go to work
[22:58:18] <Anticom> bye
[22:58:42] <sprezzatura> djQuery: hmm. i would like to make the example work instead
[22:58:56] <djQuery> sprezzatura: $(this).next().hasClass('hidden') would do about the same thing wouldnt it
[22:58:58] <sushi4664> http://jsfiddle.net/UDwWg/1/ - the for loop ive commented doesnt work
[22:59:23] <djQuery> sprezzatura: then do a toggleClass instead of a plain toggle
[22:59:25] <sprezzatura> djQuery: here, i dont want to make the request to get data again.
[23:00:17] <sushi4664> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/UDwWg/1/
[23:00:19] <djQuery> sprezzatura: also $this.data(getdata) ==0 is better. dontthink you need the .value
[23:01:36] <sprezzatura> djQuery: how do you set then. actually, can you update there, so i can understand what you comment
[23:02:39] <ejo> Hey, has anyone come up with a good workaround for the unreliable nature of image onload handlers?  I'm not talking about the FAQ/noob move of trying to set the handler after setting the image source.  I'm talking about something even the jQuery docs mention: that image onload handlers seem to fire inconsistently or not at all across various browsers.
[23:04:53] <joshsmith> I'm having some issues with same-origin policy in a getJSON() call
[23:04:55] <ejo> I'm trying to load highly compressed (low Q) jpegs, but replace them with original high-quality sources loaded by ajax asynchronously.  So that a page can initially load faster but by the time anyone has gotten very far with looking at the images they've sharpened up.
[23:05:16] <ejo> joshsmith: I think that's what jsonp is meant to handle
[23:05:24] <ejo> (or at least one of the use cases for it)
[23:05:32] <joshsmith> ejo: I tried inputting a jsoncallback param
[23:05:39] <Northwoods> ejo: actualy a good idea
[23:05:41] <joshsmith> but I'm not sure I'm using the right syntax
[23:05:54] <ejo> joshsmith: unfortunately i don't know much more about it
[23:06:26] <joshsmith> the problem is that the API I'm calling has some params with periods
[23:06:33] <joshsmith> so jQuery's choking on the syntax
[23:06:38] <ejo> Northwoods: thanks!  Earlier, I set this up so that I would just load the Q=50 optimized jpegs quickly (typically around 30k for 800x600 for the images i'm dealing with) and then let the user click each one to replace it with the full quality original.
[23:06:43] <joshsmith> otherwise I'd just break out all the params and not have a huge request string
[23:07:20] <ejo> Northwoods: That worked great -- in fact I was surprised browsers seemed to handle it smoothly and in-place when I simply swapped the src attribute of the <img> with another data attribute.
[23:07:35] <ejo> As long as width and height were the same it was seamlessly composited right over without jumping.
[23:07:59] <Northwoods> ejo: what with different dimensions , did you try it ?
[23:08:02] <ejo> However... I then realized I didn't need to make the user click.  Why not have every image replace itself with its high-quality original after it's loaded.
[23:08:13] <Northwoods> ejo: absolutely
[23:08:15] <ejo> mm, no I hadn't tried that, that's a good question for curiosity
[23:08:20] <Northwoods> most of web applications work this way
[23:08:31] <djQuery> ?tell sprezzatura something like this sprezzatura dont know why the text isnt changing though sprezzatura
[23:08:31] <bot-t> djQuery, Okay.
[23:08:54] <djQuery> ?tell sprezzatura something like this http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/XJvQ3/4/ dont know why the text isnt changing though
[23:08:55] <bot-t> djQuery, Okay.
[23:09:06] <Northwoods> ejo: not only for images , i have seen poeple load other heavy stuff , after the page has loaded , or on user request
[23:09:36] <ejo> So now I'm, for each image, adding a new img element right after it, making that hidden, then setting the hidden img's onload to a callback, then setting the hidden img's src to the high-quality source.
[23:09:49] <ejo> The callback for each one simply sets it visible and the earlier low-quality version hidden.
[23:09:53] <ejo> But it's not working :P
[23:10:46] <jcapelo> help with this ? http://pastebin.com/AcCeAntm
[23:10:57] <ejo> joshsmith: maybe URLencode the param string or something?
[23:11:03] <djQuery> sushi4664: wouldnt that be better if you could put those items in the definition of the html inputs them selves?   <input data-hide="#elm1, #elm2"
[23:11:27] <joshsmith> ah I got it working
[23:11:45] <joshsmith> apparently it matters that you specify dataType BEFORE the url
[23:11:52] <joshsmith> didn't realize
[23:12:14] <sushi4664> djQuery: haha guess you are right
[23:12:26] <sushi4664> will do and will come back if i have any problems
[23:12:27] <sushi4664> thanks!
[23:12:33] <djQuery> sushi4664: also since #id uses the native browser .getElementByID   there is no reason to create a selector like #parent #child
[23:12:42] <ejo> So what I'm really looking for is, has anyone come up with a clever jQuery solution to making sure image onload callbacks fire?
[23:13:07] <ejo> .load() 's callback just doesn't seem to be reliable for images.  Maybe I need to fiddle with .ajax() stuff?
[23:14:22] <joshsmith> actually this isn't working again
[23:14:41] <joshsmith> I'm doing a get, jsonp, all that, and it's returning a Script resource rather than application/json
[23:16:28] <ejo> that's your server's fault I'd say
[23:16:34] <ejo> is the server under your control?
[23:16:41] <ejo> what's on that end
[23:17:32] <ejo> please don't say a pile of php
[23:19:56] <joshsmith> oh, it's just my localhost right now
[23:20:09] <joshsmith> and I'm not doing anything server-side atm
[23:20:25] <joshsmith> I'm literally just looking at the returned json from the success in console
[23:20:59] <ejo> but uh... you're doing your GET from where
[23:20:59] <joshsmith> though I need not even do that for it to choke
[23:21:04] <ejo> what is serving the GET request
[23:21:19] <joshsmith> oh, right right
[23:21:20] <joshsmith> my bad
[23:21:26] <joshsmith> it's Bing's API
[23:21:31] <joshsmith> so no, sadly not under my control
[23:21:32] <ejo> ohhh
[23:21:48] <ejo> if I knew anything about Bing and its API i'd try to be helpful
[23:21:57] <ejo> maybe they're not set up for jsonp
[23:22:05] <joshsmith> they are
[23:22:07] <joshsmith> I read their docs
[23:22:10] <ejo> oh.
[23:22:21] <joshsmith> http://pastebin.com/nvAEAMmd
[23:22:22] <ejo> maybe some parameter you need to send?
[23:22:27] <joshsmith> maybe I'm just doing something dumb
[23:22:33] <ejo> do you need to set your request headers' accept field?
[23:22:45] <ejo> that's the usual HTTP way of telling the server what content type you want back
[23:22:46] <joshsmith> no idea
[23:22:46] <djQuery> sushi4664: also instead of doing a bind\click for each one I would do a delegte on the parent.   $('#parent').delegate('input[data-hide], input[data-show', 'blur', function(e){ $this=$(this); if($this.data('hide'){ $($this.data('hide').hide(),}} repeat for show })
[23:23:36] <joshsmith> I might be using the wrong version :/
[23:23:49] <ejo> joshsmith: jquery's .ajax() lets you set your request headers if needed
[23:23:55] <djQuery> ejo: I believe that if the image was allready cached that it wont reload it
[23:23:56] <ejo> oh wrong API version?
[23:24:05] <joshsmith> ejo: how do I set that?
[23:24:23] <djQuery> so .load wont be called?
[23:24:24] <ejo> djQuery: i think I read that somewhere.  Hmm.  Does that in itself maybe suggest a possible workaround with a conditional?
[23:24:34] <joshsmith> nah, it's not the wrong version after all
[23:24:37] <ejo> joshsmith: just look in the .ajax() docs
[23:24:42] <joshsmith> ejo: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd250846.aspx
[23:25:04] <ejo> and probably look up the w3c info on http request headers, which isn't really as dense as it looks at first
[23:25:15] <ejo> but i can't promise that's where the problem lies! :|
[23:25:24] <djQuery> src="url'+"?nothing=" + new Date().toString()
[23:25:30] <djQuery> ejo: ^
[23:25:37] <ejo> djQuery: ohhh right.  fingerprint it
[23:25:45] <ejo> force non-cached response
[23:25:54] <ejo> good call
[23:26:01] <djQuery> ejo: band width hog
[23:26:15] <djQuery> probably a good band name.
[23:26:21] <ejo> yeah but I can reliably expect that case to happen rarely.
[23:26:42] <ejo> although if someone reloads my page for no reason yeah it would be a bandwidth hog.  I'll keep thinking on solutions
[23:27:35] <ejo> It's funny, what would work well enough would be just revert to the way I was doing it earlier, then have jQuery call the click handlers :P
[23:27:44] <ejo> that wouldn't be a hog since it uses unaltered urls
[23:28:27] <djQuery> ejo: it would be a saver as it only ever loads the high rez if they ask for it
[23:28:44] <joshsmith> ejo: so if I specify dataType: 'jsonp', then Bing's servers are expecting a callback function, but if I don't specify that dataType and just pass in a param of JsonType=raw, then, it still yells at me about same-origin
[23:29:04] <djQuery> ejo: I dont got no mobile devices and my home internet is 30meg up\down so I dont typicaly care
[23:29:05] <ejo> I'm just kind of baffled that that solution worked at all.  I'd have thought that when the user clicks the low-quality image and jQuery/js then replaces the image src attribute, the browser would blank there for a moment while loading the new one.  I was amazed that it seemed to recomposite the high-quality image right over the low one.
[23:29:16] <bEEEeviz> guys? i want to bind a function to all links inside a list, whose list items dont have nested lists inside
[23:29:42] <ejo> joshsmith: i think that's expected behavior, yeah
[23:29:44] <joshsmith> so the dataType: 'jsonp' means that jQuery is expecting a script when it's just getting raw json
[23:29:56] <joshsmith> I want to just parse the raw json
[23:29:57] <sushi4664> djQuery: Sorry, I'm very new to jQuery - what is data-hide and hide?
[23:30:01] <joshsmith> is there not any way to do that?
[23:30:02] <bEEEeviz> e.g.: <ul><li><a href="#">No function binding on parent li</li><li><ul><li><a>Function binding on parent li</a></li></ul></ul>
[23:30:04] <sushi4664> djQuery: shouldn't they be the same?
[23:30:26] <bEEEeviz> i tried $('ul li:not(>ul) a')
[23:30:33] <bEEEeviz> but that didnt work
[23:30:34] <djQuery> sushi4664: too late brain has dumped that data allready
[23:30:42] <ejo> joshsmith: just grab the raw response body and parseJSON it
[23:30:45] <bEEEeviz> (function binding on a, not "on parent li")
[23:30:48] <ejo> or whatever that's called
[23:31:02] <ejo> joshsmith: what are you using to perform the ajax request?
[23:31:06] <ejo> jquery's .get() ?
[23:31:09] <joshsmith> $.ajax
[23:31:12] <ejo> oh good
[23:31:26] <joshsmith> but I'm specifying get
[23:31:33] <ejo> people waste a lot of time on the convenience methods but $.ajax() gives you more to work with
[23:31:37] <djQuery> beeeviz: see ?:has
[23:31:37] <bot-t> beeeviz, :has(selector): Selects elements which contain at least one element that matches the specified selector. http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/
[23:31:43] <joshsmith> yeah I always use $.ajax()
[23:31:44] <djQuery> but it is realy slow.
[23:31:47] <bEEEeviz> ah
[23:31:48] <bEEEeviz> got it
[23:31:51] <djQuery> also see ?:not
[23:31:51] <bot-t> :not(selector): Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[23:31:55] <djQuery> also realy slow
[23:32:03] <joshsmith> also really slow
[23:32:06] <bEEEeviz> $('ul li:not(:first-child(ul)) a').bind('click', function() {});
[23:32:13] * ejo reminds bot-t to tell people which selectors are really slow
[23:32:36] <djQuery> $('#parent').delegate('input[data-hide], input[data-show]', 'blur', function(e){ $this=$(this); if($this.data('hide'){ $($this.data('hide').hide(),}} repeat for show })
[23:32:51] <djQuery> sushi4664: this what u were refering to?
[23:32:59] <joshsmith> ejo: so is there any way to make $.ajax not add in a callback function so it doesn't choke on raw JSON
[23:33:07] <joshsmith> but also avoid the same-origin warnings
[23:33:11] <sushi4664> djQuery: yes
[23:33:19] <djQuery> see ?.data
[23:33:19] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[23:33:25] <ejo> joshsmith: I think so, but haven't done that lately so I forget.
[23:33:31] <joshsmith> anyone here know?
[23:33:38] <ejo> google for it, i know there are blog posts on that
[23:33:44] <ejo> it's a common case (ish)
[23:33:44] <joshsmith> I have been
[23:33:44] <djQuery> sushi4664: http://api.jquery.com/has-attribute-selector/
[23:33:56] <ejo> try other vocab? lol
[23:34:20] <ejo> if not, switch beer for coffee or vice versa ;)
[23:34:20] <djQuery> sushi4664: also if you wanna learn jquery I suggest you see ?jqf
[23:34:21] <bot-t> sushi4664, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[23:34:38] <djQuery> ejo: no its coffe and whiskey
[23:34:45] <joshsmith> Why do you want the response to be raw text? It isn't possible to get a response that is just JSON from a JSONP request, because the nature of JSONP requires the response is wrapped in a function call.
[23:34:52] <djQuery> no need to switch just always combine

[23:38:14] <bot-t> sushi4664, Concentrate and ask again.
[23:38:19] <joshsmith> I think it's waiting for the callback function to process, but idk wtf I'm supposed to do there

[23:42:14] <wkmanire> djQuery: Really? Thats awesome!
[23:42:18] <wkmanire> My son is just over 1 year old
[23:42:25] <wkmanire> I can't wait for him to get old enough to start messing with this stuff.
[23:42:45] <djQuery> mines a little older. we even took it to the point of being able to add new questions to it
[23:42:47] * wkmanire thinks that most normal people say that about Baseball or Soccer...
[23:42:58] <robertor> ejo i have something like this http://pastebin.com/r9gWdYva
[23:43:16] * wkmanire is an American, which is obvious cause he said "Soccer"
[23:43:17] <wkmanire> he he
[23:43:20] <djQuery> thought about turning it into a facebook app but I hate facebook
[23:43:44] <wkmanire> djQuery: I just have to ask, what kinds of questions did your kids add?
[23:44:06] <djQuery> wkmanire: ansers they added.
[23:44:16] <wkmanire> right
[23:44:32] <wkmanire> wkmanire: I forgot to use my magic 8 ball before formulating that question.
[23:44:33] <djQuery> although we did make it to where certain questions it would allways give the same response.
[23:44:39] <djQuery> Is the cake a lie?
[23:44:45] <wkmanire> Is Dad awesome?
[23:44:49] <djQuery> No the cake is a pie
[23:45:17] <djQuery> and of course since they both have read life the univers & everthing
[23:45:25] <djQuery> we had to put 42 in there
[23:45:31] <wkmanire> well done
[23:45:33] <wkmanire> :D
[23:46:37] <wkmanire> Yeah, I suppose I'll just have to bide my time. I'm still waiting for this.wipeArse() to work.
[23:46:46] <djQuery> they gotta kick out playin with $(this).effect("shake", { times:3 }, 300);
[23:47:01] <wkmanire> he he he
[23:47:22] <sushi4664> djQuery: did you mean something like: http://jsfiddle.net/WGMxZ/
[23:47:52] <djQuery> wkmanire: stock up on lego technics while u still can we had a ball when he was yonger every christmas pulling out the new one from under the tree
[23:48:06] <wkmanire> djQuery: technics?
[23:48:16] <wkmanire> Is that a sort of erectorset version of legs?
[23:48:17] <wkmanire> legos*
[23:48:32] <wkmanire> sushi4664: Lables on the right? thats interesting.
[23:48:58] <wkmanire> Usually on see that with RTL languages.
[23:49:30] <wkmanire> only*
[23:49:48] <djQuery> wkmanire: yes very cool and you can save up all the pieces for when he gets old enough for his first ?NXT
[23:49:53] <robertor> hi guys! how can i reload the DOM after use the function after() ? I have something like http://pastebin.com/r9gWdYva
[23:50:30] * wkmanire is looking at the site.
[23:50:39] <wkmanire> Wow... that is way cooler than the stuff I had.
[23:51:04] <wkmanire> robertor: You want the browser to reprocess the whole DOM?
[23:51:05] <wkmanire> why?
[23:51:21] <djQuery> sushi4664: <input hideid="whatever" is not proper html custom attributes should use data-attrname="whatever"
[23:51:35] <wkmanire> Just changing any part of the DOM is enough to cause the browser to do a reflow.
[23:51:50] <Anticom> re
[23:52:21] <Anticom> buttons now get disabled correctly, but not at the right time =/
[23:52:36] <robertor> wkmanire, because, the new elemnt, doesn't has the style used by jquery
[23:52:42] <sushi4664> djQuery: sorry - connection reset - so the code didn't work right for some reason. sorry for bothering you again - http://jsfiddle.net/WGMxZ/
[23:53:02] <wkmanire> robertor: Are you using jQuery-UI?
[23:53:20] <robertor> wkmanire, i have simplify the problem, but i think the problem is the same...
[23:53:39] <robertor> wkmanire, yep...
[23:53:42] <wkmanire> robertor: Very little if any styling is applied by jQuery widgets and functions.
[23:53:53] <Anticom> http://pastebin.com/PwLzcDvn
[23:54:08] <wkmanire> robertor: Using Javascript that is
[23:54:20] <wkmanire> They use a combination of CSS classes from the jQuery UI stylesheet.

[23:54:48] <robertor> wkmanire, the real point is that i have added a new button, but the function that i has defined when i clickit it doesn't work
[23:54:50] <ZeuZ> Is there a way to make jQuery report how much of a file I've uploaded currently?
[23:55:03] <wkmanire> robertor: The link djQuery posted was for you
[23:55:03] <ZeuZ> I'm trying to do away with flash for a upload bar indicator
[23:55:18] <djQuery> sushi4664: is this easier http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/WGMxZ/1/
[23:55:25] <wkmanire> robertor: You can use delegate or live to bind an event to any elements that match a selector now or in the future.
[23:55:41] <wkmanire> (now being relative to the first time the function selector is run)
[23:55:55] <djQuery> wkmanire: no I just forgot the order of the parameters for delegate
[23:56:05] <wkmanire> oh
[23:56:09] <wkmanire> well, same answer stands I believe.
[23:56:25] <robertor> wkmanire, what function i should bind?
[23:56:49] <wkmanire> robertor: Bind is more specific, it only binds to elements that match the selector at the time it is run.
[23:57:32] <djQuery> roboto errr sorry robertor: delegate kicks bind\clicks ass
[23:57:32] <wkmanire> robertor: If you want to define a function to be used as a handler for a click event on a button that will not come into the DOM until later on then you should use Live.
[23:58:33] <robertor> i see... i have to use a live function.... now i'm confused, because i don't see what function should be inside...
[23:58:35] <wkmanire> djQuery: does it?
