[00:24:31] <r1card> I'm using jQueryUI Datepicker and it renders huge. I see no option controlling size.
[00:24:33] <r1card> Ideas?
[00:34:43] <Tram> Good morning all. I have a problem, i have this jquery object (a UL with some LI items that are hidden). And i want to find those li items using a selector on the UL, and then find some of the hidden items using a unique class. However the .find() function is not working. Not even on the li items. Anyone have a idea why?
[00:39:50] <TheBrayn> hi
[00:40:08] <manners13> Hi guys i am slowly building a restore page for my backup system i have got it to the point where i use dyantree to display a tree with checkboxes, however when i select a folder i only manage to see the folder name selected using this code http://codepad.org/8tkVgJ48 , i could really do with getting a list of the filenames selected including full path if possible however complete filenames
[00:40:08] <manners13> alone would suffice,
[00:52:14] <TheBrayn> https://gist.github.com/3838625 <- I wrote this to expand a tr element in a table when the user hovers over it, sometimes elements expand and then shrink again in a loop
[00:53:53] <TheBrayn> what can I do against this?
[00:55:04] <AdamPDotty> sometimes it helps to have a container around the hover-element
[00:55:07] <AdamPDotty> that is slightly bigger
[00:55:43] <AdamPDotty> basically the expanding gets the element away from the mouse
[00:56:02] <AdamPDotty> so end of hover and shrinking again
[00:56:06] <TheBrayn> hm
[00:56:11] <TheBrayn> how can I do this with a table?
[00:56:13] <AdamPDotty> which brings it back ...
[00:56:48] <AdamPDotty> not sure
[00:56:58] <AdamPDotty> maybe expand the td when hovering the tr
[00:58:18] <TheBrayn> instead of expanding the tr?
[00:58:34] <AdamPDotty> yes
[00:58:42] <AdamPDotty> worth a try
[00:59:59] <chrisbuchholz> Is there some built in way in jquery to get all siblings between two siblings?
[01:01:07] <AdamPDotty> I do not know any, but a combination of next() and prev() might help
[01:01:22] <chrisbuchholz> AdamPDotty: yeah, i use nextUntil() at the moment
[01:01:49] <AdamPDotty> oh yes sounds reasonable
[01:02:42] <chrisbuchholz> AdamPDotty: and it works fine if i chose element(2) and then choose element(6) but if i choose element(6) first, my list inverts. So i need a way to figure out which of the two elements is first listed in the DOM
[01:03:45] <TheBrayn> how can I get the first td element inside a tr using "this"
[01:03:56] <AdamPDotty> first idea would be to get both nextUntil()s then merge
[01:04:06] <AdamPDotty> as one would be empty
[01:04:15] <TheBrayn> I could just write '#id > td' but I don't want to write #id again
[01:04:45] <AdamPDotty> $(this).find('td:first')
[01:04:49] <TheBrayn> thanks
[01:05:18] <xec_> TheBrayn: what is "this"
[01:05:50] <TheBrayn> good question
[01:05:50] <AdamPDotty> in his case the tr that is hovered over
[01:07:11] <Asone> ohai people
[01:14:07] <TheBrayn> in my code example above the valign: "top" does not work, how can I do this?
[01:18:47] <xec_> TheBrayn: there is no valign css property, try "vertical-align" or verticalAlign
[01:23:22] <TheBrayn> doesn't work, the text still stays in the middle of the element
[01:29:45] <code_ph0y> hey guys do you know if this works in jquery .... if($(#name)!=undefined) {bla}
[01:30:49] <code_ph0y> if($('#name')!=undefined) {bla}
[01:30:56] <code_ph0y> soz typing to fast
[01:31:45] <xec_> code_ph0y: use .length instead
[01:32:00] <code_ph0y> .length?
[01:32:02] <xec_> code_ph0y: if ($('#id').length)
[01:32:06] <AdamPDotty> if $('#name).length()
[01:32:18] <xec_> without the parens (not a method)
[01:32:21] <AdamPDotty> oops
[01:32:57] <AdamPDotty> I thoug without would be the none-jquery-version
[01:32:59] <AdamPDotty> ht
[01:33:33] <code_ph0y> nice yeah i get ya :P ... I am abit confused though what does this do from a theory point of view?
[01:33:49] <code_ph0y> i know what length does but why is it used in this case
[01:34:09] <code_ph0y> it basically gives a lenght of a text string?
[01:34:15] <code_ph0y> length*
[01:34:24] <xec_> code_ph0y: length returns 1 (or more) if the selector matches something, which is truthy
[01:34:36] <xec_> code_ph0y: but 0 if not (which is falsy)
[01:35:00] <xec_> .length is the number of items matched
[01:35:03] <code_ph0y> ahhhh nice! you learn something everyday! lol ... gonna love programming ;)

[01:53:57] <code_ph0y> in mootools you can do something like event.target.class ..... how do you do this with jquery?
[01:54:32] <code_ph0y> i tried .... event.target.attr('class'); but it didn't work
[01:55:13] <code_ph0y> event is coming from ...... .change(function(event) {

[01:56:53] <TheBrayn> how can vertically align the text to the top of a td element with jquery?
[01:58:12] <TheBrayn> I tried to put verticalAlign: 'top' in .animate() but this does not work
[01:59:06] <TheBrayn> got it
[02:13:25] <fRAiLtY-> Got an odd one, this function should skip weekends and dates within the array. Weekends should be skipped :x except checkDate(1) shows a Saturday. The odd thing is, when I tried this yesterday it DID work, so I think it's the math calc not quite right but I'm stuck :x http://jsfiddle.net/fRAiLtY/F4Nbf/
[02:21:03] <pedda> hi all
[02:21:18] <pedda> i have created a slideshow with the cycle2 plugin, which works quite fine
[02:21:44] <pedda> i added some movement for the image through an callback event of cycle2
[02:22:20] <pedda> after a slide transition has ended, the slide is moved left or rightwards via animate
[02:22:59] <pedda> but the animation is not smooth enough
[02:23:26] <pedda> i#m moving the slide for example -35px within 8000ms
[02:24:47] <rio{> fRAiLtY-: What's the end result you are looking for? what is turnaround ?
[02:26:19] <mvk> i'm using a live('click') handler on a checkbox, but when its clicked in the function when i use a selector
[02:27:32] <mvk> is .live('change') on a input textbox fired when its changed trough .val() ?
[02:35:58] <keirlav87> what good options are there for creating templates with jquery?
[02:37:02] <fRAiLtY-> rio{:  The idea is whatever number I feed checkDate() it doesn't return a weekend or a date in the array
[02:37:07] <fRAiLtY-> Only Monday->Friday
[02:51:50] <anli> I want to create combine live with each, is that possible?
[02:53:19] <anli> There is no create event?
[02:57:29] <pedda> what is the best practice to slide an image horizontally over a longer period of time but just a few pixels without making the image jiggle ?
[02:57:44] <pedda> like ken burns without zooming
[03:01:12] <anli> Hm, I can listed on dom modifications, right?
[03:01:14] <code_ph0y> hey guys how do you to this dataArr[] = {"name": name, "value": value};
[03:01:21] <tompaw> Hello.
[03:01:26] <code_ph0y> think am confusing php with js lmao
[03:01:44] <anli> I need to listen for asp.net mvc3 partial view insertions
[03:02:08] <tompaw> I need to ajax-refresh a DOM element every X seconds. What is the proper way of doing it without builing up a huge call stack that will ultimately consume all of my ram and elecricity?
[03:02:43] <tompaw> Can I do it recursively?
[03:02:52] <tompaw> i.e. call the function by itself upon ajax data return
[03:03:45] <code_ph0y> wow "ultimately consume all of my ram and elecricity" you really made that seem dramatic i like it ;) lol am gonna have to up my game of asking questions!
[03:04:09] <tompaw> It is dramatic!
[03:05:00] <NodeX> tompaw : setInterval().
[03:05:20] <code_ph0y> hey guys how do you to this dataArr[] = {"name": name, "value": value}; so I can cure cancer :P
[03:05:44] <NodeX> if you're worried about memory leaks then assign the xhr to a variable and null it afterward
[03:05:59] <code_ph0y> awww wit!
[03:06:25] <NodeX> code_ph0y : do what?
[03:06:27] <code_ph0y> am sorry just thought about my question!
[03:06:41] <code_ph0y> basically push
[03:06:53] <NodeX> push() ;)
[03:07:09] <code_ph0y> i was trying to do php in js then I thought about it

[03:20:57] <GoSox> Can I use jquery to select an item based on the actual text within it? For example I have zip codes in simple A tags, and I want to add a class to one particularly zip code
[03:21:08] <GoSox> <a>02180</a><a>01801</a>
[03:23:49] <faraway> GoSox: currentyl i only know :contains('02180')  but that will only work if your zip codes have equal lenght otherwise you would have false resuls e.g. with :contains('218') which will also return 02180
[03:24:17] <GoSox> that should work, all zip codes here are 5 digits
[03:26:26] <GoSox> yup that works thanks
[03:26:35] <faraway> GoSox: np
[03:29:55] <reloadz> hi!
[03:31:10] <reloadz> why this line doesn't work? - selectors is 100% correct.
[03:31:10] <reloadz> $("#" + img_name + " img").attr("src", img_name + new Date().getTime() + 2000)
[03:32:01] <GoSox> an img tag's src is a url to the image, that doesn't look like what you'd get from that code
[03:33:36] <reloadz> OMG! selector was 100% wrong!
[03:33:42] <TheBrayn> how can I apply an action to all child elements of an element depending on their id?
[03:35:36] <Tommmmmmm> TheBrayn: what sort of dependancy? You can do $('#id').find('*').each to loop through all children of an element.
[03:35:59] <Tommmmmmm> well find() will do multiple level children, or children() which will only do the next level.
[03:36:28] <TheBrayn> ok, thanks
[03:36:53] <daftspunk> hey all - im trying to do a select similar to $('[name="bar"]'), except my field has name="foo[bar]" and i want foo to be a wildcard, $('[name="*[bar]"]') .... seems wrong...
[03:38:52] <faraway> daftspunk: if you want to have all that ends with [bar]  yu could do $("[name$='[bar]']")
[03:38:55] <Tommmmmmm> daftspunk you could do [name$="[bar]"] -> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-ends-with-selector/
[03:39:36] <Tommmmmmm> too slow =[
[03:39:42] <Tommmmmmm> too slow =[
[03:39:52] <faraway> Tommmmmmm: :P
[03:39:55] <Tommmmmmm> ok that sent twice :s
[03:40:05] <Tommmmmmm> :D
[03:40:13] <daftspunk> w00t! thanks guys!

[03:40:35] <TheBrayn> which type will $(this).find('td:nth-child(2) > div > div') have?
[03:40:52] <AdamPDotty> jquery set
[03:41:30] <TheBrayn> does this set contain the 3rd level divs?
[03:41:46] <AdamPDotty> hmmm no
[03:42:04] <TheBrayn> what does it contain?
[03:42:08] <AdamPDotty> 2 levels below td
[03:42:18] <TheBrayn> that's what I meant
[03:42:37] <AdamPDotty> or wait
[03:42:46] <AdamPDotty> no right hehe
[03:45:50] <reloadz> hey! i had problem with image reload....
[03:45:51] <reloadz> $("#" + img_name).attr("src", http_adr + "module/catalog/product_img/" + cid + "/" + img_name + "_small.jpg?" + new Date().getTime());
[03:46:02] <reloadz> it works, but ire refreshes too fast....
[03:46:12] <reloadz> can i put som delay on it?
[03:46:26] <AdamPDotty> ummm
[03:46:27] <AdamPDotty> yes
[03:46:39] <reloadz> 1 sec?
[03:46:45] <reloadz> how! :D ^^
[03:47:04] <AdamPDotty> define "too fast"
[03:47:45] <reloadz> i crip imageand image needs to refresh - "new dimensions, etc" server hasn't croped it, but it is refreshing......
[03:47:50] <reloadz> crop
[03:47:55] <reloadz> image*and
[03:51:21] <AdamPDotty> errrm
[03:51:26] <AdamPDotty> how do you crop?
[03:51:35] <AdamPDotty> ajax-call?
[03:52:13] <reloadz> jcrop! and i .post( values)
[03:52:31] <reloadz> is that what you asked?
[03:52:57] <AdamPDotty> so its hard to tell, when the server will be ready
[03:53:42] <GoSox> can you set a cusotm user agent to use with $.get() ?
[03:53:50] <GoSox> i don't actually want to do this, just wondering if you easily can
[03:53:56] <reloadz> yes! that is the reason why i want to refresh after 1 sec (i think 1 sec is planty time for server)
[03:54:04] <GoSox> ack no, not a user agent, a custom http_referrer
[03:54:27] <AdamPDotty> well, try it
[03:54:49] <AdamPDotty> else wait for server response and server has to make sure cropping is done
[03:55:10] <reloadz> ou!.....
[03:55:50] <reloadz> idiot! i can echo "done!"; back and then make refresh
[03:55:50] <AdamPDotty> setTimeout
[03:55:59] <AdamPDotty> hehe
[03:56:01] <AdamPDotty> yep
[03:56:33] <reloadz> can .post() cet back balues from other files?
[03:56:53] <reloadz> cet = get*
[03:56:58] <AdamPDotty> GoSox: I believe beforeSend helps
[03:57:07] <AdamPDotty> "Use this to set custom headers, etc. "
[03:57:13] <reloadz> balues = values*
[03:57:53] <AdamPDotty> not values from files, but from server
[04:03:20] <lolo647> hey
[04:04:11] <lolo647> quit
[04:04:14] <lolo647> :1uit
[04:04:18] <lolo647> :quit
[04:07:25] <GoSox> When you guys make websites, that use jQuery to load content dynamically into your pages...
[04:07:45] <GoSox> do you do anything on those "content" pages to protect them, so other websites don't use their own jquery to load your content, directly into THEIR websites?
[04:11:47] <TheBrayn> how do I get the class of every element in $(this).find('td:nth-child(2) > div > div') while iterating over it?
[04:12:00] <TheBrayn> I thought it must be .class because .id exists
[04:12:04] <TheBrayn> but it's not right
[04:12:50] <TheBrayn> .attr('class') doesn't work either
[04:19:37] <AdamPDotty> classname
[04:19:44] <AdamPDotty> maybe capital N
[04:22:24] <pangelovski> hi guys, I'm trying to align a label and a text input on one line inside a field contain but for some reason it doesn't align.
[04:22:48] <pangelovski> hi
[04:22:56] <pangelovski> hi
[04:23:02] <pangelovski> hi
[04:23:06] <pangelovski> hi guys, I'm trying to align a label and a text input on one line inside a field contain but for some reason it doesn't align.
[04:23:16] <GoSox> well that was an easy /ignore
[04:34:31] <ProblemEmitter> pangelovski: stop asking the question again and again
[04:34:54] <pangelovski> sorry, my client went buggy
[04:34:59] <_archer_> Hi everyone.  I normally sit in here and answer questions, but today I have one of my own
[04:35:28] <ProblemEmitter> We are big ears
[04:35:38] <_archer_> I have a function in a C# (asp.net) app that I want to expose to JavaScript.  I can call it via an Ajax call, but I want to be able to make that function synchronous
[04:36:01] <_archer_> I don't want to restrict myself to using older versions of jQuery to do the ajax call though
[04:36:38] <_archer_> Any thoughts on good ways round this?  I just don't want to duplicate the code in 2 different platforms if I don't have to
[04:37:41] <jeffsmykil> ugh sometimes im a huge moron
[04:39:52] <jeffsmykil> which version of asp.met?
[04:40:24] <_archer_> I'm using .Net 2
[04:40:54] <jeffsmykil> yeah we use like 4 here
[04:41:15] <_archer_> This is an old application that isn't going to be changing that drastically any time soon (if ever)
[04:42:24] <jeffsmykil> we call everything via services
[04:42:30] <jeffsmykil> like you are talking about
[04:42:31] <ProblemEmitter> _archer_ cant you just call it via synchronous ajax call?
[04:42:31] <_archer_> Surely the version of .Net would have no bearing on this anyway - the main problem I have is making a synchronous function that internally makes an Ajax call
[04:42:56] <_archer_> ProblemEmitter - I'm happy to do that, but it's not supported in jQuery 1.8+
[04:43:13] <ProblemEmitter> cant send the 'async' flag to false? :O
[04:43:16] <ProblemEmitter> set*
[04:43:24] <jeffsmykil> wait so its an old web app but you are using brand new jquery?
[04:43:45] <ProblemEmitter> you can have your own wrapper for the ajax functionality and still make the sync call happen
[04:43:49] <_archer_> ProblemEmitter - yes you can, but it does nothing.
[04:44:23] <_archer_> jeffsmykil - I'm adding new functionality to an existing app.  All the client-side code is pretty new as the guy before me knew little of JavaScript and nothing of jQuery.
[04:45:00] <_archer_> ProblemEmitter - The only examples I've seen of faking synchronous calls have used timers, and it just looks wrong
[04:45:21] <_archer_> If that is the only answer, then so be it.  I'm just looking for opinions from others who may have faced the same problem
[04:45:40] <GoSox> its kind of amazing how little HTML you use to make a website these days
[04:46:04] <ProblemEmitter> i mean, if you open an XMLHttpRequest with an async flag set to false, that should just work fine
[04:49:06] <_archer_> ProblemEmitter - sometimes we get too used to the new methods of doing things!  Thanks for the wake up :)
[04:49:09] <ProblemEmitter> you should just probably downgrade to 1.7.x and thats it
[04:49:37] <ProblemEmitter> you dont really need jQuery 1.8 do you?
[04:49:40] <_archer_> I was just single minded on using jQuery that I didn't think of making the call myself
[04:49:47] <ProblemEmitter> oh, hood
[04:49:49] <ProblemEmitter> good
[04:50:01] <ProblemEmitter> just read the XMLHttpRequest documentation then :)
[04:50:11] <_archer_> I don't need it now, no, but I don't want to negate the possibility of upgrading in the future
[04:50:28] <_archer_> I've done it before - even got old code that I can use.  Just not as old as my fading memory :p
[04:50:43] <_archer_> Thanks for the reminder - just what I needed
[04:52:27] <jeffsmykil> does anyone know if microsofts rotation filter works on divs?

[05:06:52] <faLUCE> hi. Is there a library (maybe on github) which creates a dinamically resizable grid layout where I can place media content (for example: a video) widgets?
[05:11:27] <xkr47> hi
[05:11:57] <xkr47> there is $.parseJSON(json) for importing json, but how do I export json ?
[05:13:11] <xkr47> aha, found it.. https://code.google.com/p/jquery-json/
[05:15:00] <garann> xkr47: that's also built-in in most modern browsers as JSON.stringify, i believe
[05:15:23] <code_ph0y> hey guys how do you explode a string in js
[05:16:06] <keirlav87> if i have nested data, is it better to create an array of objects or objects within objects or what, or is there different use cases for each?
[05:16:26] <xkr47> garann, unfortunately I need to support IE7 as well :)
[05:16:40] <garann> aww, i'm sorry xkr47
[05:16:54] <xkr47> garann, and that plugin nicely uses the built-in versions if available
[05:17:14] <garann> keirlav87: i think it depends on what you're doing with the objects
[05:17:24] <GoSox> supports IE7?? hah
[05:17:35] <GoSox> gotta get that extra 1.7% traffic boost
[05:19:17] <xkr47> GoSox, piss off :)
[05:19:47] <GoSox> i don't even support IE8 on new sites. I use all fancy HTML5/CSS3 stuff, and IE8 and below get the ol' browser upgrade page
[05:20:52] <xkr47> I work for a large corporation, personal opinions have little influence
[05:21:09] <GoSox> I have not expressed any opinions yet
[05:21:14] <xkr47> thanks to jquery, IE7 isn't that bad
[05:21:26] <xkr47> one would think that's why people are using jquery
[05:21:37] <GoSox> for IE7 support? nope that ain't it
[05:22:23] <xkr47> you sound like a typical time-wasting bully, so I should probably add you to my ignore list
[05:23:15] <GoSox> If i wanted to waste time, I'd support IE7 :-D
[05:23:37] <xkr47> you waste other people's time
[05:23:44] <GoSox> hey i thought i was ignored
[05:23:45] <mazzachre> Can I somehow replace tabs with a span that I can control the size of?
[05:24:46] <garann> what kind of tabs, mazzachre?
[05:28:27] <xkr47> mazzachre, like <p>[tab][tab]foo   --> <p><span style="width:5px"></span>foo ?
[05:28:35] <fuchstronaut> how can i select two indexes of elements in one expression? something like $('div').find('p').eq(5).eq(3)
[05:30:21] <xkr47> fuchstronaut, $('div').find('p').filter(function(index){return index==3||index==5;}) perhaps ?
[05:30:31] <fuchstronaut> so smart
[05:30:32] <fuchstronaut> thanks
[05:31:05] <xkr47> I used jqapi.com and looked for "filter" :)
[05:33:16] <clu3> i have a hidden div that contains images. The image onload callback doesn't get called when i change the image's src attr because the wrapper DIV is hidden. Is there a way to overcome this?
[05:34:13] <garann> fuchstronaut: $( 'div' ).find( 'p:nth-child(3),p:nth-child(5)' ) also... but you should probably just use a class
[05:45:42] <mazzachre> Yes, the tab character... I have a preformated document with some tab indents (code) But it is getting hard to read because the user needs to scroll out to the left to read it, so I would like to limit the size of the tabs to somethink like 2 spaces instead of 8...
[05:46:11] <xkr47> then you could replace the tabs by spaces perhaps ?
[05:46:59] <faraway> clu3: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/mzB4z/
[05:47:07] <mazzachre> Possibly but that would be another step in the document generation... But perhaps easier...
[05:48:49] <xkr47> I didn't necessarily mean in the server
[05:49:02] <faraway> clu3: as long as the browser has its cache active this should work
[05:49:34] <xkr47> var $elem = $("your-selector-here"); $elem.html($elem.html().replace("\t", "  "));
[05:49:52] <mazzachre> xkr47: Woudl that not be terribly slow?
[05:50:08] <xkr47> millions of lines ?
[05:50:14] <mazzachre> Not really...
[05:50:37] <xkr47> well you can try it if you want.. I don't think it would be any faster by using spans
[05:50:50] <mazzachre> right
[05:51:00] <xkr47> you can try it in the server-side as well of course
[05:51:24] <cusco> hey folks
[05:51:39] <cusco> I'm using sortable with 'connectWith'
[05:52:03] <cusco> is there a way to validate the element being connected, and thus preventing or allowing that connection?
[05:52:12] <nFFF> Guys getting: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input
[05:52:15] <nFFF> in console, at the first line of the address
[05:52:16] <nFFF> Any ideas?
[05:52:22] <nFFF> first line of the file***
[05:52:57] <myrman> You're probably missing a bracket
[05:55:38] <myrman> nFFF: Check for missing } and );
[05:57:58] <nFFF> Thanks myrman was indeed the error
[05:58:21] <nFFF> Now: console.log(scrollc.offset()); var offsetT = scrollc.offset().top; // produces Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined
[05:58:27] <nFFF> Yet the console logs a valid object
[05:58:32] <nFFF> any ideas?
[06:00:54] <jugglinmike> nFFF: store the result of .offset() in a var, log that, and then access it
[06:01:19] <jugglinmike> or better yet, just find the type: "var offset = scrollc.offset(); console.log(typeof scrollc);"
[06:02:35] <jugglinmike> sorry, not paying attention
[06:02:58] <karolyi> nFFF: can you pastebin your code?
[06:02:59] <jugglinmike> you want to run "console.log(typeof offset);" in that example
[06:03:42] <fRAiLtY-> Got an odd one, this function should skip weekends and dates within the array. Weekends should be skipped :x except checkDate(1) shows a Saturday. The odd thing is, when I tried this yesterday it DID work, so I think it's the math calc not quite right but I'm stuck :x http://jsfiddle.net/fRAiLtY/F4Nbf/
[06:06:31] <karolyi> fRAiLtY-: why don't you just parse the getDay() value?
[06:07:17] <iSeeDeadPixels> mehh
[06:07:19] <karolyi> fRAiLtY-: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_getday.asp
[06:07:37] <iSeeDeadPixels> jquery.validate doesn't really work :s
[06:08:35] <fRAiLtY-> karolyi:  So I'd be doing an if getDay() == 1 || getDay() == 6 ?
[06:08:37] <fRAiLtY-> Sort of?
[06:08:48] <karolyi> fRAiLtY-: exactly
[06:09:36] <faraway> fRAiLtY-: what is turnaround doing ?
[06:09:45] <karolyi> fRAiLtY-: if you already build a date object from your selection, it's obvious to use that then
[06:09:48] <fRAiLtY-> faraway:  turnaround is an integer
[06:10:04] <faraway> fRAiLtY-: that i was able to guess ;)
[06:10:05] <fRAiLtY-> I supply checkDate() with an integer and it calculates that many days EXCLUDING weekends/dates in the array
[06:10:51] <AdamPDotty> and week is 40?
[06:11:01] <fRAiLtY-> Huh?
[06:11:14] <faraway> fRAiLtY-: turnaround is the number of "valid days" and you want to have the date for that ?
[06:11:16] <AdamPDotty> looked like week of year
[06:12:04] <fRAiLtY-> faraway:  Yes, I pass it an integer and it returns a date. So for instance 2 working days from now is Tuesday, not including today, Friday. Yes if I pass it 2 I get Sunday.
[06:12:16] <fRAiLtY-> But, what's odd is when I did it yesterday, it worked, hence why I think it's a problem with the math
[06:12:30] <fRAiLtY-> Yet*
[06:13:24] <iSeeDeadPixels> anyone knows why my form is not validating on blur() or keyup?
[06:13:47] <karolyi> iSeeDeadPixels: details, please
[06:16:09] <iSeeDeadPixels> karolyi: http://jsfiddle.net/NFEZv/
[06:16:48] <iSeeDeadPixels> woops, http://jsfiddle.net/NFEZv/1/
[06:18:21] <karolyi> iSeeDeadPixels: are you using a plugin?
[06:18:40] <iSeeDeadPixels> yosh, the validate plugin, in wordpress
[06:18:51] <iSeeDeadPixels> i'm scripting my own stuff into wordpress
[06:18:57] <iSeeDeadPixels> not the right way though
[06:19:12] <karolyi> iSeeDeadPixels: well i guess then you have to blame the plugin
[06:19:12] <faraway> fRAiLtY-: your week calcualtion is wrong ... you have 7 days in a week but you do a % 6
[06:19:28] <iSeeDeadPixels> karolyi: it's a jquery plugin.
[06:20:12] <manners13> is there any way to return selected children only in dynatree
[06:20:20] <karolyi> iSeeDeadPixels: yes, however it's not jquery's fault when it's not working. i'd develop a form validator for myself, as with jquery it shouldn't be a big job
[06:20:48] <iSeeDeadPixels> you're a great help karolyi, thanks :)
[06:21:03] * iSeeDeadPixels toggles the sarcasm button back to off
[06:21:14] <manners13> at the moment i get a list of branches and children, which i will eventually pass back to php for some mysql queries before restore
[06:22:16] <faraway> fRAiLtY-: but despite of this your code is still wrong ;)
[06:22:41] <iSeeDeadPixels> maybe because i've pasted the whole jquery plugin into my jquery file.
[06:23:05] <karolyi> iSeeDeadPixels: sarcasm will not bring you forth to the solution. if the plugin is not working, bind a function to the form's submit event
[06:23:15] <faraway> fRAiLtY-: make the "2012-10-12"  a holiday and use 4 a turnaround wont work in with your code ;)
[06:23:39] <faraway> fRAiLtY-: 5 i mean
[06:24:07] <karolyi> iSeeDeadPixels: $('#OBForm').on('submit', function () {if (formIsNotFilledCorrectly) {return false}});
[06:24:50] <karolyi> iSeeDeadPixels: and that should do it, with the value checks within the function
[06:27:14] <fRAiLtY-> faraway:  What's wrong with it :( ?
[06:28:26] <amcsi_work> hello
[06:28:46] <amcsi_work> would someone please link me a example of a $.Deferred queue?
[06:28:46] <manners13> actually sod it ill just pass this back to php and mess with it to get it right
[06:31:01] <faraway> fRAiLtY-: well with your code you do the following ... you check the what date is in x work days .. thats ok .. but then you loop over the holidays .. and for each holiday day that is between the current date and the sendOn date, you add one day .. but you don't take care about if this new date will be a weekend
[06:31:19] <iSeeDeadPixels> karolyi: not what i asked, sorry
[06:31:22] <asker> hey guys, is there a possibility to flush ajax responses to the request? so i can show to the user in which state the script is?
[06:32:11] <faraway> fRAiLtY-: if you have more then 7 bank holidays in between you have definitely a wrong date
[06:32:40] <jac0bz1> I'm trying to reload an local iframe. $("#itemID-1").children("iframe").contentDocument.location.reload(true); says that it canot read property of location
[06:32:57] <fRAiLtY-> faraway:  Damn, took me ages to get to there :((( Is it much to fix?
[06:33:07] <karolyi> asker: can you be more precise on that?
[06:33:16] <G0Gr33n> jacobroufa:  Maybe show an example :)
[06:33:44] <faraway> fRAiLtY-: well if you make sure that you only add the bank holidays that are week days it should be easly solvable
[06:34:16] <asker> karolyi: im uploading a file on which some script are performed, its a pdf which gets splitted and screenshoted and it takes a while
[06:34:22] <karolyi> amcsi_work: https://github.com/karolyi/Forum/blob/master/js/app.js
[06:34:46] <asker> so i want to show to the user some msg after upload, msg after splitted, msg after screenshoted
[06:34:53] <karolyi> amcsi_work: look at the code, there are $.when().then() statements as $.Deferred() definitions too
[06:35:12] <faraway> fRAiLtY-: hmm but still there is something wrong
[06:35:27] <asker> is it possible somehow by 1 request? or do i have to split the hole script in peaces and make separate requests?
[06:35:36] <amcsi_work> okay thanks. the internet here sucks currently and it didn't load yet :/
[06:36:09] <jac0bz1> never mind my question
[06:36:15] <jac0bz1> found it out
[06:36:29] <karolyi> asker: normally you should do that with more requests, but if you have a stete machine installed (node.js with socket.io for example) you can achieve this with that too
[06:37:15] <karolyi> *state
[06:37:17] <asker> this what?
[06:40:12] <karolyi> asker: if you are uploading to a server-side processer script, you should be able to request the state of that script from your browser, and by that you could achieve the workflow you wanted. the support of partial replies from webservers are very limited by browsers, to my knowledge firefox is the only one which supports that ATM
[06:40:19] <fRAiLtY-> faraway:  But the bank holidays ARE weekdays, so I don't need to check
[06:40:54] <faraway> fRAiLtY-: yes but the day after the bank holiday is not needed to be a weekday
[06:41:08] <faraway> fRAiLtY-: it could be a weekend and that you don't check
[06:41:21] <cusco> how do I check if a <ul> contains a <li> with innerText = myStr
[06:41:29] <asker> ok well, so no way to avoid multiple request... i got it, ty ;)
[06:41:44] <cusco> im using .map() already, how do I check if a str is in map() ?
[06:42:10] <xec_> cusco: you could try the :contains() selector
[06:42:23] <cusco> thanks
[06:46:23] <amcsi_work> karolyi: thank you, but I meant a queue where tasks are added while tasks are resolving
[06:47:20] <rotham_> hey.. is there a jquery addon that will help with something like displaying notifications when someone tries to leave a page, and there are still things loading?
[06:47:27] <karolyi> amcsi_work: you can stack up $.when.then()
[06:47:57] <keirlav87> can arrays not hold indexes of their values?
[06:48:11] <amcsi_work> the tasks are asynchronous
[06:48:25] <ryanneuf_> keirlav87: what is it you think an array does?
[06:48:30] <fRAiLtY-> faraway:  So is it fixable?
[06:48:40] <keirlav87> sorry, named indexes
[06:48:50] <karolyi> amcsi_work: please be more precise about that
[06:48:55] <ryanneuf_> keirlav87: no, that wauldn't be an array
[06:49:02] <faraway> fRAiLtY-: yes .. sorry .. need to go to meeting
[06:49:08] <keirlav87> no would suffice :P, thanks
[06:49:23] <amcsi_work> so there is an ajax queue that constantly has tasks added to it, even while the ajax queue is resolving
[06:49:35] <ryanneuf_> keirlav87: your question wasn't clear, I wasn't sure if you were having trouble with array indexes
[06:49:49] <amcsi_work> but the next task should always only resolve when the last async ajax request is done
[06:50:07] <keirlav87> thanks though, so if I need a named index - object is the way to go?
[06:50:10] <ryanneuf_> keirlav87: you can use an object literal to represent something similar to a hash (or an indexed array if you're coming from PHP)
[06:50:11] <faLUCE> where is the problem  here?  http://jsfiddle.net/nZEUg/   <--- I want to resize both upper and lower panel, but I can resize only upper one. The code is adapted on  http://www.pagecolumn.com/javascript/drag_resize.htm   .
[06:50:28] <keirlav87> yeah PHP has given me a warped perspective of what an array is I think
[06:50:44] <karolyi> amcsi_work: you could build up a queue for yourself
[06:51:20] <amcsi_work> yes, I was only asking in case someone knew a good pattern for it. This seems to be good: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4869609/how-can-jquery-deferred-be-used
[06:51:54] <ryanneuf_> keirlav87: yes, I use PHP every day, and I agree. PHP's arrays aren't really arrays in the purest sense, they're more like hashes
[06:52:11] <karolyi> amcsi_work: yes, something like that
[06:52:53] <ryanneuf_> keirlav87: https://gist.github.com/3839906
[06:53:02] <keirlav87> I like whatever they are though - I'd prefer if all arrays were PHP arrays if that makes sense
[06:53:31] <keirlav87> ryanneuf_ : thanks for that
[06:53:31] <ryanneuf_> keirlav87: I like the php arrays, but they are fraught with peril some tims
[06:53:58] <ryanneuf_> keirlav87: like you can do array(1 => foo, 3=>bar); and it's totally valid
[06:54:35] <amcsi_work> alright, thanks
[06:54:37] <ryanneuf_> but if you use a for loep (opposed to foreach) it may not behave as you would expect for an array
[06:54:47] <ryanneuf_> keirlav87: I'm sure you've noticed that^^
[06:55:16] <Wolf_22> I'm trying to test some window resizing functionality and I'm having problems using "alert" as a means of testing some logic with it. What's a good way to test something like this?
[06:55:31] <ryanneufeld_> Wolf_22: see ?console.log
[06:55:45] <ryanneufeld_> Wolf_22: see ?console
[06:55:52] <ryanneufeld_> doh, no bot
[06:55:52] <Wolf_22> ryanneufeld_:I'll try that.
[06:55:55] <Wolf_22> thanks
[06:56:01] <ryanneufeld_> Wolf_22: console.log() is pretty handy
[06:56:14] <TheBrayn> is it possible to inherit from a jquery element class?
[06:56:23] <ryanneufeld_> Wolf_22: if you know how to use the javascript console you can watch the output there
[06:56:55] <Wolf_22> ryanneufeld_:I've used it before--I just wasn't sure if my resizing code would crash it like the alert code did with Firefox (so I didn't attempt it but I'll try it now).
[06:57:10] <iSeeDeadPixels> what the hell...
[06:57:19] <ryanneufeld_> Wolf_22: that's why we recommend console.log over alert. Alert is blocking
[06:57:28] <iSeeDeadPixels> in jsfiddle, my validation works, in owrdpress it doesn't
[06:57:28] <cusco> xec_: seems that contains() is not working.. can you take a look at http://paste.debian.net/196570/
[06:57:31] <ryanneufeld_> Wolf_22: console.log isn't
[06:57:31] <cusco> ?
[06:57:34] <keirlav87> I tend to only use foreach for iterating, is that bad practice? Sorry for OT btw room
[06:57:46] <Wolf_22> ryanneufeld_:k. I didn't realize that.
[06:58:40] <karolyi> iSeeDeadPixels: give me your url if it's reachable from outside
[06:58:53] <ryanneufeld_> keirlav87: I do that too
[06:59:01] <cusco> ahh.. Note: The first argument must be a DOM element, not a jQuery object or plain JavaScript object.
[06:59:08] <iSeeDeadPixels> karolyi: it isn't :(
[06:59:25] <iSeeDeadPixels> nothing in the chrome console either
[06:59:50] <hashpuppy> ca i .bind ajax:success on the parent of the form?  or must it be the form?
[07:00:02] <keirlav87> ryanneufeld_ thanks for your help mate
[07:00:13] <rmill> jenia
[07:00:23] <rmill> woops, lol
[07:00:41] <cusco> how do I check if a map() contains 'String' ??
[07:00:53] <iSeeDeadPixels> karolyi: walk me through?
[07:01:24] <karolyi> iSeeDeadPixels: try to pastebin the source code of your webpage then
[07:07:12] <faLUCE> Is there a library/sample code that fits this specification?  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7248444/grid-of-resizable-elements-with-jquery-are-there-any-libraries-that-would-supp
[07:07:29] <ryanneufeld_> faLUCE: checkout masonry
[07:07:43] <faLUCE> rue: it's not resizable
[07:07:53] <ryanneufeld_> faLUCE: http://masonry.desandro.com/
[07:08:02] <ryanneufeld_> read the docs, it is
[07:08:30] <faLUCE> I mean: each panel must be resizable and adjacent panel should automatically resize in order to fit all the screen
[07:08:54] <ryanneufeld_> ohuc
[07:08:57] <ryanneufeld_> *I see
[07:09:47] <ryanneufeld_> then I'm not sure if something like that exists
[07:09:59] <ryanneufeld_> you could probably use jqueryui resizable maybe?
[07:11:22] <faLUCE> ryanneufeld_: I know that, but I need a grid of cells. the grid has to adapt other cells after resizing a particular one
[07:11:47] <ryanneufeld_> faLUCE: okay
[07:12:01] <ryanneufeld_> a table with %widths and a resizable cell?
[07:12:13] <ryanneufeld_> not sure man, I don't know if a plugin that does that
[07:12:20] <ryanneufeld_> you might have to roll your own bud
[07:12:24] <faLUCE> ryanneufeld_: exactly
[07:12:45] <ryanneufeld_> though you could us masonry
[07:12:58] <ryanneufeld_> and have it resort once you've change the size of any given widget
[07:13:09] <ryanneufeld_> but you need fixed width right?
[07:13:16] <ryanneufeld_> so that might not work
[07:13:52] <faLUCE> I want a starting WxH for each cell of the grid/table.  Then, user can resize it
[07:14:13] <faLUCE> my needing is exactly this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7248444/grid-of-resizable-elements-with-jquery-are-there-any-libraries-that-would-supp
[07:19:29] <faLUCE> ryanlabouve: this is something similar to my needing:  http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxLayout/index.shtml  <--- but I want to resize diagonally a panel without having to resize horizontally and vertically in sequence
[07:25:49] <Wolf_22> I have some resizing code inside a $(document).ready(function() call. The resizing code is really nothing more than $(window).resize function that uses $(window).width and height variables to resize things based on dimensions... The problem is that the effect seems very delayed (i.e. - it will resize after about 25 seconds or something). What might cause this?
[07:26:27] <hlve> Wolf_22: http://www.jsfiddle.net Mock up an example. otherwise we're unable to really help you debug.
[07:28:26] <poppiez> is there any way to prevent an input field from blurring when clicking a div element?
[07:28:43] <poppiez> I could return false; on mousedown but that renders my div unclickable
[07:30:33] <tlkr> poppiez why don't you just make mousedown on the div set focus to the input?
[07:30:34] <angrywombat> how do i select only file inputs on a form? $(":form type[file]") or something?
[07:31:05] <poppiez> tlkr: because the mousedown event occurs before the blur event. it would still blur it
[07:31:10] <tlkr> angrywombat dont wish to be that guy but read that -> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ =/
[07:31:44] <angrywombat> tlkr: i understand
[07:31:54] <angrywombat> i just dont remember the syntax to select specific form types
[07:31:56] <tlkr> you could try binding the focus on click then
[07:32:08] <angrywombat> and i dont want to ID them all
[07:32:14] <angrywombat> i guess ill just add a class
[07:32:25] <tlkr> lazyness frustrates me.
[07:33:37] <garann> angrywombat: $( 'input[type=file]' )
[07:33:54] <angrywombat> garann: thank you
[07:33:57] <angelazou> how can I find the number of elements I've stored in an object?
[07:34:19] <tlkr> .length ? angelazou
[07:34:23] <tlkr> http://api.jquery.com/length/
[07:37:00] <angelazou> thanks
[07:40:51] <scar> can anyone explain why .click() doesnt get applied to elements dynamically generated after page load but .on() does?
[07:41:12] <scar> just trying to understand lol
[07:45:33] <ujjain> http://www.radioactivethinking.com/rateit/example/example.htm - Can this browser send an Ajax request?
[07:45:41] <angelazou> is it possible to convert an object with key value pair into an array?
[07:45:53] <angelazou> so all the key and value are now just array element?
[07:46:44] <phryk> What would be the right way to display multiple items, though only one at a time, with jQuery mobile if I want to show a navigation for these items? Multiple pages come to mind, but when using multiple pages everything but the pages seem to be removed from display…
[07:49:04] <phryk> Basically I want to load multiple articles at once and display them in a manner like: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/content/content-collapsible.html With each menu item on the left corresponding to one article. But the demo just loads the complete page from an external source, including the menu…
[07:50:38] <angelazou> I'm having a little problem trying to get the length of an array
[07:50:46] <angelazou> oh actually, it's an object
[07:52:14] <angelazou> I have it here http://jsbin.com/ivalab/1/
[07:52:20] <angelazou> I tried .length
[07:52:24] <angelazou> but it's not working
[07:52:39] <Pilate> its still an object
[07:53:03] <angelazou> Pilate: so...? I can't get it's length?
[07:53:26] <Pilate> there is no length, its an object
[07:53:27] <angelazou> tried .size as well, even .count, though I don't think it exists
[07:53:52] <phryk> Isn't 'set' a reserved word?
[07:54:05] <phryk> Ah, apparently not.
[07:54:15] <Pilate> angelazou: if you really must: 'Object.keys(set).length'
[07:54:36] <phryk> angelazou: keys(set).length works for me in chrome dev
[07:54:53] <angelazou> yes, I got it working, thanks Pilate

[08:06:30] <angelazou> ujjain: can you post the entire script?

[08:11:46] <TheBrayn> is it possible to store the state of a jquery object and then restore it?
[08:12:02] <TheBrayn> for a toggle function
[08:12:12] <TheBrayn> I hate undoing all the stuff I have changed
[08:18:54] <sahbeewah> TheBrayn, what part of its state do you need to restore?
[08:19:03] <scar> im using an ajax to submit a post request to wordpress. it works just fine for one but i copy the code and change the names, and now im getting an Object returned in error and cant figure out what the error is
[08:26:40] <ujjain> Ajax seems harder to debug.
[08:26:53] <ujjain> I just get error, I can't even see what is the returned ajax output
[08:27:12] <ujjain> the voting works, but if you already voted, it does not give the right content
[08:28:02] <TheBrayn> sahbeewah: I have a tr which is changed inside a toggle function, I want to restore the tr
[08:29:35] <TheBrayn> it work with var backup = $('something').html(); and then $(this).html(backup);
[08:30:07] <TheBrayn> which saves a lot of work :o

[08:33:12] <orion> Hi. In jQuery UI how do I make the radio button elements multi-line?
[08:38:45] <tlkr> Guys, I have a draggable div which on pick up resizes using .animate to 49px width, I am trying to drop it into a droppable which is 50px wide with a tolerance of fit. The draggable keeps reverting. However, if I set the width to 49px manually using CSS with no animation it doesn't. Any ideas?
[08:45:08] <Hubarz> hi
[08:46:44] <karolyi> whew
[08:47:20] <Hubarz> i got a div, which has a parent (about 3 levels higher) of the class .dev-con
[08:47:21] <Hubarz> how to get this parent into a jquery object?
[08:47:36] <Hubarz> i tried parent() and closest()
[08:48:07] <karolyi> Hubarz: .parent().parent().parent()?
[08:48:22] <NoiseEee> .parents(selector)
[08:48:34] <ajpiano> .closest(".dev-con")
[08:48:56] <Hubarz> karolyi: but what, if the level is not always the same?
[08:48:57] <manners13> please can anyone help, i use dynatree to select files for a restore, and at the moment i can see the list of things selected by using this line </div>Selected keys: <span id="echoSelection3">-</span></div>, i would like to be able to send the output of this back to a php variable so i can manipulate it to get what i really need
[08:49:28] <manners13> can anyone point me in the right direction, im sure its easy but dont think my brain is in gear
[08:49:59] <Hubarz> ajpiano: I already tried it, doesn't work
[08:50:05] <ajpiano> ?doesn't work
[08:50:05] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[08:50:17] <Hubarz> -.-
[08:50:19] <Hubarz> xD
[08:50:40] <Hubarz> wait a sec ill build a test site :)
[08:52:44] <karolyi> manners13: $('span#echoSelection3').each(function(item) {//your code here})
[08:55:30] <karolyi> Hubarz: closest should work, but actually i suggest to use a more simple minded approach and to be more pragmatich with the alignments of the divs you're using
[08:55:38] <karolyi> -h
[09:03:40] <docmur> if I have a JSON output like text.firstName, text.lastName and I want to get that to show up in an HTML input as a placeholder what would be the right code, '<input type="text" placeholder='+text.firstName+' '+text.lastName+'>'; will only show the first name, what is the correct way to do this?
[09:04:43] <NoiseEee> docmur: you're missing the double quotes around the attribute
[09:04:50] <silverwind> docmur: You set it with JS.
[09:05:41] <docmur> okay, that way simple, usually single quotes work in HTML, my bad
[09:06:35] <NoiseEee> docmur: they do but you're not using *any* type of quotes around the attribute.  and im assuming you're actually creating that <input> via a string as you described
[09:07:25] <docmur> ya that skipped my mind, I wasn't thinking correctly about the use that single quote was doing
[09:12:27] <Hubarz> what can cause "NaN"?
[09:13:29] <BillCriswell> Hubarz: parseInt('hi')
[09:13:44] <hlve> Hubarz: Not a number.
[09:13:58] <Hubarz> my line looks like this: $(document).height() - ($(con).innerHeight() + $(con).offset.top - $(this).outerHeight())
[09:14:33] <TheBrayn> Hubarz: Array(16).join("l" - 2) + " Batman!";
[09:14:34] <BillCriswell> Hubarz: Hmm... It's hard to know without know what con and this is.
[09:14:43] <BillCriswell> without knowing*
[09:14:49] <Hubarz> var con = $(this).closest('.des-container');
[09:14:58] <Hubarz> in an each()
[09:15:36] <BillCriswell> Hubarz: Why are you double wrapping? ;)
[09:15:54] <BillCriswell> Just do con.innerHeight() and con.offset.top
[09:17:23] <BillCriswell> Are you sure that .des-container exists as well?
[09:17:31] <Hubarz> yes
[09:17:48] <BillCriswell> I just tried double wrapped a jQuery object and it didn't break anything, but you're still doing more than you have to.
[09:18:10] <BillCriswell> Hubarz: Might need to provide a fiddle
[09:18:49] <karolyi> http://us4.memecdn.com/I-Was-A-Web-Developer-Before-The-Internet_o_93665.jpg
[09:18:53] <Hubarz> you mean fiddle like violin?
[09:19:04] <BillCriswell> Hubarz: Totally.
[09:19:07] <BillCriswell> Hubarz: http://jsfiddle.net/
[09:19:14] <manners13> pmsl
[09:19:28] <BillCriswell> karolyi: Haha.
[09:20:04] <Hubarz> may i use external jquery plugins in fiddle?
[09:20:25] <hlve> Hubarz, yes. on the left hand side, you should see "Add resources"
[09:21:11] <BillCriswell> Hubarz: I'd just log con and this and make sure it's what you think it is.
[09:24:43] <poseid> hmm.. I am bit confused by isotope
[09:25:04] <poseid> before, my items were reorderd when I changed the window size
[09:25:33] <poseid> now, everything is static, and I can't figure it out... anyone can give some pointers, where/how to debug it?
[09:25:46] <orion> 0x23DFE496
[09:26:02] <orion> 0x12DFA867
[09:26:11] <BillCriswell> poseid: Is resizable set to true?
[09:26:53] <BillCriswell> poseid: Went through here and it seems like the only way that can be turned off: http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/options.html
[09:27:16] <Hubarz> BillCriswell: that's just a basic test document :D http://jsfiddle.net/Tw7X8/1/
[09:28:12] <Hubarz> if i do the same code wit hardcoded id selectors it workd
[09:28:21] <Hubarz> *work
[09:28:26] <Hubarz> s
[09:28:27] <Hubarz> -.-
[09:28:29] <poppiez> doesn't stopPropagation() work for blur events?
[09:30:27] <BillCriswell> Hubarz: con.offset.top is undefined.
[09:31:14] <poseid> thanks.. will examine it, BillCriswell
[09:31:16] <BillCriswell> Hubarz: http://jsfiddle.net/Tw7X8/2/
[09:32:02] <BillCriswell> poseid: No problem!
[09:33:35] <Hubarz> BillCriswell: That's the trick? Thank you!
[09:33:50] <BillCriswell> No problem at all.

[09:40:02] <BillCriswell> adavia: I'm just trying to understand the problem.
[09:42:15] <BillCriswell> adavia: Are you submitting with AJAX?
[09:48:29] <karolyi> sjeijk: you may use any of jquery ui's builtin effect

[09:49:38] <sjeijk> ok tx, will try inner fade and if that 'll not fit ill look into your suggestion
[10:51:06] <JesuZ> Hello... Is there way to make selector :not(:has(element, .class)) and this should match only elements, that don't have element AND .class?
[10:52:17] <Zzaichik> ! $('element.classname')
[10:56:56] <docmur> This might not be possible, I have a <div> which has multiple <div> tags inside of it that are draggable.  Is there a way to allow the inner <div> tags to move outside the parent <div>?
[10:57:49] <shoky> JesuZ:  :not(:has(element):has(.class))
[10:58:25] <JesuZ> shoky so I can chain :not(:has(element)):not(:has(.class)) ?
[10:58:54] <JesuZ> Oh sorry, read brackets wrong...
[11:00:59] <docmur> got it
[11:02:31] <javalover> wierd question but...if i want to attach a variable to a bind like myobject.scroll()  how would I do that?

[11:03:17] <timeturner> if I delegate an event to bubble up through a div that contains a bunch of button descendents
[11:03:25] <timeturner> how do I "get" the button that fired the event
[11:03:31] <timeturner> within the event callback
[11:03:38] <timeturner> I'm not sure how to reference the actual element that fired the event
[11:03:47] <timeturner> when it is proxying through some other containing element
[11:03:53] <Zzaichik> this  ??
[11:04:06] <Zzaichik> ?this @timeturner
[11:04:06] <bot-t> timeturner, my code, http://jsfiddle.net/rTus6/
[11:04:13] <Zzaichik> that didn't work
[11:04:15] <Zzaichik> haha
[11:04:31] <timeturner> but doesn't that reference the main div?
[11:05:09] <jedimind> i dispise that validator
[11:05:11] <timeturner> $('.someDivClass').on('click', 'button', function(){ // this == .someDivClass element ?
[11:05:35] <timeturner> how do I get the button
[11:07:24] <Zzaichik> @timeturner  http://jsfiddle.net/yHrCW/
[11:08:31] <Zzaichik> ¿esta bien?
[11:09:58] <expando->  $('#definition').load('server.html',{word: hash});
[11:10:22] <expando-> what does the fragment "{word:hash}" means?
[11:11:41] <firstclassfunc> why doesn't .click() work for newly added elements? why  must .on('click') be used?
[11:13:03] <expando-> <firstclassfunc>
[11:13:14] <expando-> i think it is same as the difference
[11:13:15] <Zzaichik> Because it doesn't exist at the time the DOM is loaded / created.
[11:13:22] <expando-> between bind and live
[11:13:34] <expando-> it will be faster if you use bind
[11:13:52] <silverwind> live is dead
[11:13:53] <expando-> and live is designed for custom needs when updating the dom
[11:13:55] <silverwind> ;)
[11:13:58] <expando-> :)
[11:14:03] <silverwind> It's on all the way nowadays
[11:14:37] <expando-> i knew it according to docs but it was good to explain the difference
[11:14:38] <silverwind> $(document).on('click', selectorHere, function(event) {}); //same as .live
[11:14:51] <expando-> i'm not jquery expert :)
[11:15:07] <silverwind> Neither I.
[11:15:07] <expando-> what about my question?
[11:15:23] <silverwind> Just came back from diner... what's the question?
[11:15:33] <expando-> $('#definition').load('server.html',{word: hash});
[11:15:43] <expando-> what does {word:hash} means?
[11:16:00] <expando-> according to the api documentation i understood
[11:16:11] <expando-> that it is a way to pass parameters to the server
[11:16:15] <expando-> am i correct?
[11:16:22] <silverwind> expando-: It's been a while since I used that but IIRC, it would just append ?word=hash to the url
[11:16:27] <silverwind> (For a GET request)
[11:16:51] <expando-> IIRC = ?
[11:17:00] <silverwind> If I Remember Correctly.
[11:17:04] <hlve> iirc = if i remember correctly
[11:17:05] <hlve> lol
[11:17:09] <expando-> ok :)
[11:17:12] <hlve> quick typer, silverwind ;P
[11:17:14] <expando-> thank you
[11:17:15] <silverwind> :P
[11:17:52] <expando-> when i saw  IIRC
[11:18:10] <expando-> i understood as something like second release candidate :)
[11:18:39] <silverwind> The POST method is used if data is provided as an object; otherwise, GET is assumed.
[11:18:40] <silverwind> Ah
[11:19:50] <expando-> it is a tricky detail for the people who don't read api docs :)
[11:20:30] <widoz> hi, in this form http://jsfiddle.net/ntVtk/ the parent rule doesn't show any error message if the #age value is greater than 13

[11:34:57] <lethjakman_work> hey, if I have a <select> object in jquery, should .val(1) set it to the second value? Because I have one and it doesn't seem to be working.
[11:35:10] <lethjakman_work> https://gist.github.com/bf90154910605fd4fd9f
[11:35:13] <lethjakman_work> my code
[11:35:33] <shoky> .val(1) would set it to the option whose value is 1
[11:35:39] <shoky> not the second value.
[11:35:50] <lethjakman_work> oh
[11:36:08] <lethjakman_work> hm....how would I set it to a number within that?
[11:36:16] <lethjakman_work> say there are 10 values and I want to set it to 5?
[11:36:19] <lethjakman_work> the fifth
[11:36:34] <lethjakman_work> or even better....how do I get that selector as a non jquery object?
[11:37:58] <shoky> .prop('selectedIndex', 4)  would work
[11:38:26] <shoky> what selector do you mean?
[11:39:48] <black_warlock> hello guyz
[11:39:53] <lethjakman_work> what I'm trying to do is change the value of a <select> that I've gotten the value of via   var sel = $('*[id^="po"]');
[11:40:03] <black_warlock> hello ** shoky **
[11:40:03] <lethjakman_work> it doesn't seem to change it though.
[11:40:33] <tubbo> anyone here use redactor? just curious why http://redactorjs.com/docs/ tells me to call redactor inside another anon function
[11:40:47] <tubbo> i've never been instructed to call a plugin like function() { $('#myElement').plugin(); }
[11:41:00] <tubbo> it's also in a DOM ready which...seems kinda pointless?
[11:41:06] <shoky> lethjakman_work: you could also  .children().eq(4).prop('selected', true)  to select the 5th option
[11:41:07] <tubbo> just wondering why one might want to do that..
[11:42:48] <shoky> tubbo: the anonymous function is the callback to $(document).ready ..
[11:43:17] <shoky> they just didn't put it in the same line..
[11:43:43] <tubbo> shoky: ahh ok
[11:43:45] <tubbo> thanks shoky
[11:43:58] <shoky> black_warlock: *helo*
[11:44:11] <black_warlock> =)

[12:09:19] <tubbo> <%= is ERb for "echo the return value of this Ruby code"
[12:09:24] <anew> some kind of template
[12:09:29] <tubbo> anew: oh, probably ECo
[12:09:33] <tubbo> or EJS

[12:36:34] <kaylee> aside from specifically specifying "autocomplete" to "off", what else would prevent a input text field from automatically showing previous entries that the user has submitted (I don't want to auto complete from a list of options that the code is providing, I just want to make sure the user can select from stuff they've entered in before)?

[13:07:09] <lethjakman_work> anew: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'YourE' of undefined " is that located somewhere else?
[13:08:24] <anew> weird i dont get that error here
[13:09:06] <anew> lethjakman_work how did u see that error ?
[13:10:26] <lethjakman_work> anew: what browser are you using?
[13:10:43] <hlve> can anyone help me debug this jsfiddle? it's supposed to search out and filter the div items, not hitting a breaking point, or anything, just breaking.
[13:10:44] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/aQzsd/1/ i'm assuming I have the calling the plugin section wrong, but I can't figure this one out
[13:11:13] <anew> lethjakman_work i see you saw it in fiddle... i dont have that error here so that cant be it
[13:11:49] <anew> i will fiddle the whole page
[13:12:06] <lethjakman_work> oh lol....your problem might be because you don't have a semicolin after "this._init()"
[13:12:19] <lethjakman_work> http://jsfiddle.net/5ZHVu/2/
[13:12:29] <lethjakman_work> always jslint things
[13:12:36] <lethjakman_work> go through all those errors and it might work
[13:13:07] <lethjakman_work> I get my errors from chrome. I go into the element inspector, then click on "Sources" then in the bottom left you see a > with three lines next to it. it opens up the javascript console
[13:13:10] <lethjakman_work> which has all the errors in it
[13:14:20] <anew> i see that ; now
[13:14:46] <lethjakman_work> anew: is it working?
[13:14:53] <anew> not yet
[13:15:07] <lethjakman_work> alright, clear out that JSLint stuff, it'll only take a few and it makes it easier to debug
[13:15:24] <anew> run it thru jslint? ok
[13:19:14] <Hubarz> do you recommend it to wait for $(document).ready() ?
[13:21:38] <gaspar|work> Hey, I need to check if element has class prefix-* (like prefix-warehouse or prefix-shipping) and return the matching class name part (so prefix-warehouse returns warehouse). Is there a simple one-liner to check this?
[13:26:14] <Zzaichik> *[class^='prefix-']
[13:26:26] <Zzaichik> css baby
[13:31:44] <Clex> What's the closest lib to Graphviz in JavaScript / HTML5?
[13:33:16] <gaspar|work> Zzaichik: so $("#some-element").css("*[class^='prefix-']") ?
[13:33:50] * jedimind blinks
[13:33:57] <jedimind> .css() lets you specify css
[13:34:32] <lethjakman_work> Hubarz: what do you mean wait?
[13:35:49] <jedimind> $("*[class^='prefix-']").each(function() { console.log( $(this).param('class') )})
[13:35:55] <jedimind> gaspar|work, ^
[13:36:25] <shoky> (that only checks the first class)
[13:36:40] <ravenzz> use is()
[13:36:55] <gaspar|work> jedimind: I don't think that will work. I have multiple elements on the same page differing on prefix-*
[13:36:58] <shoky> there's no simple one-liner for what he's asking for, afaik
[13:37:16] <gaspar|work> would this work? .attr("class").match("/prefix-*/") ?
[13:37:24] <jedimind> ........................
[13:37:25] <shoky> that is closer, yes
[13:37:41] <jedimind> $("*[class^='prefix-']").each() will go through every element that has prefix-*
[13:37:46] <ravenzz> shoky there is. it is called JS :p
[13:37:53] <jedimind> that means "every element that begins with "prefix-"
[13:37:55] <jedimind> that selector
[13:37:59] <shoky> jedimind: it would go through every element whose class attribute begins with prefix-
[13:38:14] <jedimind> yeah i just said that
[13:38:15] <jedimind> :)
[13:38:16] <gaspar|work> I need to find out what prefix-* the element has, I am iterating over these elements anywa.
[13:38:36] <jedimind> literally take what i gave you, and cut'n'paste it
[13:38:38] <jedimind> to see the result
[13:38:41] <jedimind> then continue asking questions
[13:39:02] <gaspar|work> In other words, I have several items I am iterating over. Now every element has prefix-* that is different. I need to know what the prefix-* is.
[13:39:46] <ravenzz> ?g mdn match @ gaspar|work
[13:39:47] <bot-t> gaspar|work, match | JavaScript | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match
[13:39:52] <gaspar|work> jedimind: I would iterate over every element on ovevery element, that's n^2 - very inefficient. I know it can be done in linear time.
[13:39:56] <ravenzz> there you go
[13:41:00] <ravenzz> also take a look at classList
[13:43:39] <shoky> ?eval 'bla prefix-hey lol'.match(/\bprefix-(\S*)\b/)
[13:43:43] <bot-t> shoky: ["prefix-hey", "hey"]
[13:49:38] <Zzaichik> oh, sorry guy - I walked away for a second. @gaspar|work  looks like others got you taken care of anyways. :)
[13:50:03] <gaspar|work> shoky: That worked perfectly, thanks!
[13:50:18] <shoky> yey
[13:50:39] <Zzaichik> regex ftw
[14:13:06] <subsume> heya
[14:13:25] <subsume> can anyone tell me why the ecosystem of front-end js frameworks blows?
[14:14:29] <tw2113> can you elaborate
[14:15:07] <subsume> sure
[14:15:19] <subsume> individual components have become really great--backbone.js, jquery, jquery-mobile, etc
[14:15:38] <subsume> making these things play well together is simply a nightmare
[14:17:02] <subsume> so its the ecosystem itself that sucks--various frameworks can't seem to agree on much (except perhaps jquery itself)
[14:18:05] <manners13> hey guys im using this code http://codepad.org/KBKEmXFE to dispolay a directory tree and have checkboxes which are displayed using the echoSelection3, can anyone help me add a submit button and pass the variable to a php scripts
[14:18:10] <manners13> script
[14:20:05] <manners13> i could really do with just a list of filenames/ chilren but dont think its possible so running a mysql query on the variable will give me what i want i think
[14:22:04] <duc1199> subsume: welcome to the world of web development
[14:22:19] <duc1199> subsume: you think it's any different in say, java?
[14:22:44] <subsume> can't speak to java, but certainly I can say that many other communities have cleaned up their act with regard to these things
[14:23:53] <duc1199> subsume: look at how fast everything JS is growing.. nobody puts consistency/compatibility over new features
[14:24:23] <subsume> yeah, but that sounds like immaturity
[14:24:37] <subsume> like, what is jquery-mobile?
[14:24:57] <subsume> is it a design framework? is it a routing platform for pages? a utility belt a la jquery? all of the above?
[14:25:46] <subsume> so in some ways its competing with bootstrap, in some ways backbone, in some ways jquery itself?
[14:26:57] <duc1199> subsume: yes, there is a ton of overlap
[14:27:11] <duc1199> subsume: but jq mobile came along before many of those other options
[14:27:14] <subsume> right, so what's the point of adopting a common platform like jquery if nobody wants to form any kind of scope for their projects?
[14:27:56] <subsume> it may have came before but I don't even understand what the project is
[14:27:57] <duc1199> subsume: its like wild west, yes
[14:28:15] <subsume> besides "mobile", heh
[14:28:17] <duc1199> subsume: but a year from now things will look completely different
[14:28:36] <orion> subsume: What do you think of Ruby?
[14:28:55] <subsume> I don't have many opinions. I tried to use it a while back. Have a perl background but I didn't really like the approach.
[14:29:14] <subsume> at the time it was really engrossed/built-in. I understand through merb and similar developments its less so today.
[14:29:40] <subsume> and sorry, by all that i mean rails.
[14:29:58] <subsume> ruby itself? needlessly cute syntax, vague types, etc.
[14:30:06] <duc1199> subsume: t's all gonna be obsolete in months, as long as you're having fun doing it and make a living, it's all good
[14:30:23] <orion> I was always upset not with Ruby itself, but with all the framework crap. Layers upon layers.
[14:30:47] <subsume> yeah, i think its similar to jquery--they both got hot and grew up really fast and someone lost the wheel eventually
[14:30:57] <duc1199> subsume: lol @ needlessly cure syntax
[14:31:00] <subsume> lol
[14:31:03] <duc1199> *cute
[14:31:09] <silverwind> duc1199: Right, ugly syntax is manly
[14:31:16] <orion> Brainfuck
[14:31:40] <subsume> i don't know. i went python and i feel like they've solved these framework/ecosystem problems I keep running into
[14:32:22] <subsume> integrating 20, 30, 40 different libraries in a project is pretty easy. they all have defined purposes and stay within them.
[14:32:33] <subsume> i can't even get up to using 3 in javascript-land
[14:32:36] <silverwind> I don't even know/do ruby but I know there's a lot of web frameworks... You don't need rails
[14:32:37] <tubbo> subsume: it's a lot easier when there's a definite syntax
[14:32:47] <tubbo> subsume: although imo python's package infrastructure is...
[14:32:51] <tubbo> ehh...
[14:32:52] <tubbo> :D
[14:33:05] <subsume> are you talking setuptools/etc?
[14:33:07] <subsume> pip is great.
[14:33:09] <tubbo> nah like pip
[14:33:12] <tubbo> ahh i had problems with it
[14:33:17] <tubbo> it's better than easyinstall though
[14:33:20] * syntax likes to be definite
[14:33:26] <subsume> heh, that's for sure
[14:33:26] <tubbo> and that crappy gem knockoff they did...eggs?
[14:33:32] <tubbo> nice syntax
[14:33:48] <tubbo> i kinda like ruby *because* there's more than one way to do things
[14:33:58] <tubbo> so i don't think i'm a great candidate for python development :)
[14:34:13] <subsume> right. we don't really like creativity
[14:34:20] <subsume> repetitive style is a bonus in our land
[14:34:24] <subsume> THE BORG
[14:34:26] <tubbo> haha really?
[14:34:36] <tubbo> (the second part)
[14:34:44] <tubbo> i totally get why you would do that though
[14:34:56] <subsume> totally. Take Django. In my mind its not a framework of features as much as a framework dictating consistent style/organization of apps.
[14:35:09] <tubbo> subsume: so what's rails then? :)
[14:35:36] <subsume> i don't know that my knowledge is that deep with regard to rails. i think its probably similar.
[14:35:43] <subsume> backbone seems similar too
[14:35:57] <subsume> and i like how its feature list is really humble but thorough
[14:36:32] <subsume> it seems to have easy-enough escape hatches, anyway.
[14:36:58] <subsume> look at what you have to do to make jquery stop trying overlap backbone: http://www.maximeparmentier.com/how-to-disable-jquery-mobile-router-with-back/
[14:37:12] <subsume> you have to disable 5 arbitrary things, and even then its trying to take over clicks.
[14:37:17] <tubbo> rails is more of an enforcement of basic dependencies and app structure
[14:37:33] <tubbo> however, on top of that it provides some nice inherent features, like inflections and a ready-to-use testing framework
[14:37:42] <tubbo> also asset pipeline :)
[14:37:52] <subsume> yeah, i'm glad to hear that
[14:37:56] <subsume> django is trimming down similarly
[14:39:08] <tubbo> sprockets is one of the main reasons why i've been completely disinterested with django
[14:39:16] <tubbo> because afaik nothing like that exists in python land
[14:39:19] <subsume> huh?
[14:39:27] <subsume> pub/sub?
[14:39:41] <tubbo> nah, sprockets (rails asset pipeline) is what controls your static assets like CSS,JS,etc.
[14:40:00] <tubbo> it's very powerful and extendable, and essentially defines a structure for how assets are compiled, minified and presented to the user
[14:40:12] <subsume> there's some things. django has contrib.staticfiles and then there's django-compressor
[14:40:18] <subsume> which compliments the other
[14:40:46] <lethjakman_work> is there a way to run something when the page is left?
[14:41:00] <lethjakman_work> through any means? such as clicking a link, or pressing the back button?
[14:41:14] <subsume> if(page.isLeft){ something()}); ??
[14:41:48] <lethjakman_work> ? I don't understand how that would work. that's not really a trigger is it? where would I place that?
[14:41:49] <bot-t> lethjakman_work, .submit() - Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[14:42:12] <subsume> anyway maybe i should nail my 9 theses to the door of jqm and other projects
[14:42:35] <subsume> i was so glad to find they were all using jquery and that backbone was somewhat $ agnostic. and now i'm just feeling scammed.
[14:42:56] <subsume> because bootstrap's mobile blows (imho) and i want some design around my sketch app
[14:42:56] <lethjakman_work> is there a list of events somewhere?
[14:42:58] <tubbo> fuck jquery mobile dude
[14:43:08] <tubbo> i mean it's alright...but you don't need it
[14:43:10] <tubbo> just like jquery ui
[14:43:24] <subsume> jquery ui looks okay on mobile out of box?
[14:43:36] <subsume> i am at my wits end with JQM
[14:43:36] <tubbo> they both look awesome on mobile
[14:43:48] <tubbo> subsume: you using phonegap?
[14:43:52] <subsume> naw
[14:44:01] <subsume> is that the thing that lets you make it an android/iphone app?
[14:44:06] <tubbo> yeah
[14:44:16] <tubbo> we used it here to develop an iPhone app
[14:44:17] <subsume> what benefit over a mobile website? different icon? =)
[14:44:30] <tubbo> an app in the app store, that you can modify at a later date.
[14:44:46] <tubbo> it takes like a week to get accepted into the app store, but updating is pretty trivial
[14:45:03] <tubbo> knowing this, phonegap is a great tool for getting a site out there quickly
[14:45:17] <tubbo> subsume: anyway i was saying we used jQ mobile to quickly make the UI
[14:45:20] <tubbo> and it worked for us
[14:45:27] <tubbo> but it's a single page design, with one CSS file, and one JS file really
[14:45:32] <tubbo> (+ cordova and libs)
[14:45:54] <tubbo> i'm not sure how you're using it but IMHO its best used in a single-page environment, such as a mobile web app
[14:46:16] <subsume> yeah, i have single-load thing with some sub-pages
[14:46:34] <subsume> but backbone's router seems way more mature than jqm's weird class clicky thing
[14:46:44] <tubbo> yeah
[14:47:02] <tubbo> subsume: like i said, jQuery mobile is primarily a UI/UX framework, while Backbone is a true web app framework
[14:47:06] <tubbo> you can do more shit with backbone
[14:47:57] <subsume> i know projects like JQM think its great to have a website where they will build you a .js (which to me just sounds like arbitrary insanity) but could i use that feature to remove the router stuff?
[14:48:57] <TimothyA> is there a way to fetch the redirect url from an ajax post request, and then manually redirect the user's browser to the location *without* the xmlhttprequest header?
[14:50:32] <TimothyA> actually, I'm having difficulties with just plain redirecting :|
[14:50:58] <subsume> TimothyA window.location = X?
[14:51:25] <TimothyA> subsume: apparently that isn't good enough.
[14:51:47] <TimothyA> when I do window.location = '/'; it will just attach the "X-Requested-With:XMLHttpRequest" header
[14:52:04] <subsume> strange
[14:52:10] <subsume> what problem does this cuz fmi?
[14:52:13] <tubbo> TimothyA: you're in an asynchronous request when you do that
[14:52:14] <subsume> cause
[14:52:23] <tubbo> so i think it's picking that up
[14:52:24] <subsume> heh, oh yeah, are you redir upon success?
[14:52:26] <TimothyA> tubbo: I am doing the window.location = '/'; in a callback
[14:52:49] <tubbo> TimothyA: right, i believe that's being called inside the XHR object which is adding that header
[14:53:01] <TimothyA> ah... is there a way to make it just do a regular redirect?
[14:53:38] <tubbo> not sure. why exactly do you care about the header?
[14:53:53] <TimothyA> because I don't want it
[14:53:55] <subsume> i'm not sure how it could be a redirect at all. its a request.
[14:54:23] <TimothyA> $.post('/login', {}, function(data) { window.location = '/'; }); is a basic example of what I am trying to do
[14:54:39] <subsume> not sure about jquery but does that happen upon success?
[14:54:40] <tubbo> yeah i figured
[14:54:45] <subsume> or completion
[14:54:57] <tubbo> success
[14:55:18] <tubbo> all of the $.<verb> methods do that
[14:55:19] <subsume> maybe by the time complete goes it won't be there?
[14:55:42] <tubbo> he's calling the code inside a callback fn, which is called by XHR, so i think it's gonna have the header there anyway
[14:55:53] <TimothyA> wouldn't it already be gone by the time it's at success?
[14:56:00] <TimothyA> it's the XHR the third argument?
[14:56:11] <tubbo> yup, for success
[14:56:32] <tubbo> TimothyA: you realize this exercise is completely pointless, right?
[14:56:45] <tubbo> is this like compsci homework or something
[14:57:17] <TimothyA> tubbo: no, it's something I come across that's bugging me since I actually return data in a different format based on the request
[14:57:36] <TimothyA> e.g. if it wants json, or xml, or it just wants to fetch HTML asynchronously...
[14:58:20] <subsume> tubbo also, think of the byte-savings without that header =)
[14:58:21] <tubbo> right
[14:58:24] <tubbo> haha
[14:58:36] <tubbo> TimothyA: why can't you just perform the redirect server-side
[14:58:44] <tubbo> so when POST /login happens, that action redirects to /
[14:58:58] <TimothyA> tubbo: it ignores it
[14:59:07] <tubbo> ignores what?
[14:59:09] <subsume> an ajax request that results in a redirect seems functionally strange
[14:59:15] <subsume> but maybe its conditional
[14:59:15] <TimothyA> the redirect.
[14:59:19] <tubbo> it's totally pointless
[14:59:23] <tubbo> because it's synchronous
[14:59:24] <TimothyA> but anyway, top.location.href seems to have solved it somehow
[14:59:44] <tubbo> *shrug*
[15:00:23] <bartmax> i have the design solution for the one who is doing the post-ajax-redirect.
[15:00:25] <TimothyA> ...IT DIDN'T
[15:00:27] <TimothyA> aaargh!
[15:00:47] <subsume> post ajax redirect, heh
[15:00:50] <bartmax> you dont want to do the ajax shit, you want to make a form with the inputs updated with js (maybe with a mvvm) and the just post the form.
[15:01:11] <subsume> one thing that's funny to me is that people think that ajax requests are asynchronous and somehow a server time-savings
[15:01:25] <tubbo> ajax requests are asynchronous
[15:01:33] <subsume> to the client, sure =)
[15:01:33] <bartmax> subsume: ajax requests ARE ASYNCHRONOUS
[15:01:36] <tubbo> yeah haha
[15:01:42] <subsume> to the server they aren't
[15:01:42] <tubbo> well it depends on the server
[15:01:58] <tubbo> if i have a load-balanced cluster of processes it can appear async
[15:02:05] <tubbo> or if my server is multithreaded and my app is designed concurrently
[15:02:08] <subsume> so putting a 90 second task in an ajax request isn't really asynchronous
[15:02:08] <tubbo> then it's definitely async
[15:02:09] <bartmax> subsume: who cares about the server? client always right :)
[15:02:23] <tubbo> subsume: what task takes 90sec?
[15:02:31] <TimothyA> bartmax: problem is that isn't going to work in my case. I also have forms in pop-in boxes, etc
[15:02:32] <subsume> who knows? tons of tasks do.
[15:02:42] <TimothyA> the requirements on this are really annoying
[15:02:47] <tubbo> the only ones i've seen are when the dev is trying to hack http streaming
[15:02:53] <subsume> huh?
[15:02:55] <bartmax> TimothyA: it WILL work. just make the form outside your current logic and fill it with js.
[15:03:14] <tubbo> subsume: ever watch facebook on your Network panel in Chrome/FF? you'll notice that GET requests remain open until they time out, then a new one begins
[15:03:24] <tubbo> it keeps opening new GET requests asynchronously so data can be streamed in
[15:03:26] <TimothyA> bartmax: doing a plain submit inside a pop-in box will refresh the entire page instead of just updating that specific portion
[15:03:27] <subsume> yeah but that's just long-polling
[15:03:29] <bartmax> something like: <form id="someweirdform"> <input hidden /> ... lots of hidden here <button type="submitmyass"> </form> and the button
[15:03:30] <tubbo> yeah
[15:03:32] <tubbo> that's what i mean
[15:03:34] <subsume> they've got a server waiting to be constantly polling
[15:03:43] <subsume> i dunno, an example would be if you create a collection and then the server calculates common collections to your collection?
[15:03:44] <bartmax> TimothyA: take the form OUTSIDE your current logic.
[15:03:44] <tubbo> right, so if you're doing that it's asynchronous
[15:03:48] <subsume> and there's 1M collections
[15:03:50] <tubbo> haha
[15:04:00] <subsume> do you think putting that in an ajax request is some benefit just because the client doesn't have to wait for the server to load?
[15:04:01] <tubbo> yeah that would take a while :)
[15:04:10] <TimothyA> bartmax: you're now telling me to submit the form with an AJAX request? :P
[15:04:16] <bartmax> TimothyA: no.
[15:04:21] <tubbo> subsume: no, the only benefit it assumes is that you don't have to re-load assets like images, CSS, JS
[15:04:41] <bartmax> TimothyA: i said. fill the 'inputs' with ajax request and all the magic you want, even with mvvm (aka knockoutjs) ... but then just submit the form at the 'end'
[15:04:43] <TimothyA> bartmax: then I don't get it as it would require the page to be reloaded, losing the current state of the page.
[15:04:51] <subsume> right, but i've seen projects where people think just because the client isn't doing a 90s page reload, that somehow there's efficiency
[15:04:51] <tubbo> subsume: but i also would probably put a task like that in my queue, and just return a quick response to the user
[15:05:04] <bartmax> TimothyA: ok. do you ajax request then.. jesus
[15:05:59] <bartmax> TimothyA: quite clever worring about a full redirect but trying to do a ajax redirect on success...
[15:06:10] <bartmax> try to read all again.
[15:06:10] <tubbo> there's a difference between response efficiency and data efficiency (sometimes they go hand in hand)
[15:06:28] <tubbo> TimothyA: you're gonna lose the page state anyway
[15:06:34] <tubbo> window.location = '/' will reload
[15:07:01] <TimothyA> tubbo: that was for concerning what *does* require a page reload. I also have forms that are in popins where I do *not* want to reload the page
[15:07:14] <tubbo> ah right
[15:07:15] <tubbo> ok
[15:07:24] <subsume> submitting a form via ajax just to reload page?
[15:07:53] <bartmax> TimothyA: again: keep your ajax request for all the data manipulation you dont want to reload. the actual post that wants to be reloaded. made it of a simple form and fill the data with js if needed and do a simple submit.
[15:08:08] <tubbo> alright folks
[15:08:11] <tubbo> weekend party time
[15:08:32] <subsume> later
[15:08:56] <TimothyA> subsume: depending on the data returned!
[15:09:05] <subsume> oh, i got ya
[15:09:38] <TimothyA> okay, putting it in complete didn't work either..
[15:11:58] <subsume> quite a purist, aren't you
[15:16:04] <TimothyA> finally got it
[15:16:15] <TimothyA> window.location.replace()
[15:16:29] <TimothyA> not sure why that worked, but it did
[15:17:12] <wunderCatze> hello, can someone please tell me why I dont have any results: http://jsfiddle.net/CCwJg/
[15:17:27] <wunderCatze> it is because I dont have any js code?
[15:18:15] <Mohsen_Hassani> I'm using a jquery editor, when I want to insert an image, it requires me a URL; Why is it like that? Isn't it supposed to require me a Browse button so that my users can upload files from their computers?
[15:18:19] <TelFiRE> wunderCatze: it's because you have "display:none" on the only element
[15:19:10] <wunderCatze> nevermind, it seems i forgot about display:none :) sorry
[15:19:48] <wunderCatze> @telFiRE ty
[15:20:44] <TimothyA> font-family:"Comic Sans MS", cursive;
[15:20:46] * TimothyA cringes
[15:26:13] <subsume> lol
[15:27:16] <TelFiRE> TimothyA: why? WHYYYYY
[15:29:06] <TelFiRE> lol it's like the ultimate nightmare troll attack on a designer
[15:30:51] <TimothyA> TelFiRE: ask wunderCatze
[15:41:37] <wunderCatze> guys can you help me? I am trying to add some background circles to a window. I think the easiest method is with canvas element. So I have the window and I create a canvas just over it, fill a red rect for testing, but it doesnt work... http://jsfiddle.net/CCwJg/4/
[15:45:22] <shoky> wunderCatze: jquery doesn't have .appendChild
[15:45:37] <shoky> wunderCatze: look at your console
[15:47:22] <shoky> wunderCatze: and .css('width')  returns a string
[15:47:29] <shoky> e.g.  '100px'
[15:47:34] <shoky> parseFloat it or smth
[15:49:24] <wunderCatze> ty guys for your answers! I found the solution!!
[16:23:40] <Mohsen_Hassani> Please, somebody tell me, why are all Jquery Text Editors using URL instead of FileUpload? I need a text editor which accepts images from users' computers!
[16:33:09] <soahccc> Mohsen_Hassani: Ckeditor has at least a jQuery adapter
[16:33:19] <soahccc> but you need a backend for it anyways
[16:33:44] <razzi> Mohsen_Hassani, tinymce with ajaxfileuploader works well
[16:34:52] <Mohsen_Hassani> soahccc, razzi, oh, so what's the use of all these Text Editors that work with URL? Do people have to upload their images first on the web, then provide the URL? Isn't it useless?
[18:06:37] <sandyd> Hi, I have a question. If I use console.log("up"); for example in a jquery script, will the output show up in the chrome/chromium dev tools console?
[18:07:20] <NackNick2> yes
[18:07:43] <NackNick2> does anyone know how to work with google analytics goals with ajax?
[18:08:07] <NackNick2> i made this http://pastebin.com/8N0zDtEd and im not sure its working
[18:08:36] <sandyd> hmm. That can't be good...
[18:09:09] <NackNick2> when im in here, its never good
[18:11:58] <sandyd> I am currently trying to implement http://pastebin.com/80KPpZmz on my site. So far, I haven't had any success. Can someone take a look at the script to ensure that there isn't anything wrong?
[18:12:22] <sandyd> The script is supposed to scroll one div at a time, here is an example of the current setup. http://pastebin.com/2FnXMNX9
[18:13:16] <sandyd> * should be http://pastebin.com/hLDVzeNV for the example
[18:16:16] <NackNick2> that looks like html...
[18:16:32] <NackNick2> or my eyes are playing tricks on me
[18:18:12] <sandyd> NackNick2, the second is the HTML I am using it on :)
[18:20:08] <NackNick2> they both are html
[18:20:53] <sandyd> NackNick2,  http://pastebin.com/80KPpZmz :)
[18:23:09] <NackNick2> try
[18:23:42] <NackNick2> changing var $scrollDiv    = jQuery('div#container'); to    var scrollDiv    = $('div#container');
[18:24:18] <sandyd> can't do that - wordpress does not like it
[18:24:26] <sandyd> it requires the jQuery in place of the $
[18:24:52] <sandyd> I ran it on chrome (console) though, and it works.
[18:25:22] <sandyd> using the jQuery('div#container') I mean.
[18:27:24] <NackNick2> im actually having a wp jquery crisis myself
[18:27:58] <NackNick2> did you try changing the other $ to jQuery?
[18:28:23] <sandyd> hmm. Chrome didn't output any errors on that (it didn't like the initial $ and warned me about it) so I didn't
[18:28:26] <sandyd> lemme try it though
[18:30:26] <sandyd> no - it seems to be broken in jquery :(
[18:30:43] <sandyd> I just added jQuery('div#container').scroll(function() { console.log("scroll") });
[18:31:02] <sandyd> and that should simply send me an alert if any scrolling was done at all.
[18:31:11] <sandyd> nothing. nada. in the console
[18:31:41] <sandyd> the fun part is that THAT works in the console.
[18:31:59] <sandyd> If I type it in the console, then scroll the page, it works.
[18:32:22] * sandyd facepalms
[18:33:23] <sandyd> wait - is putting <script type="text/javascript">enough for it to run?
[18:33:31] <sandyd> *around the script
[18:33:45] <sandyd> or do I have to add onload as well.
[18:34:20] <sandyd> *document.ready
[18:36:06] <NackNick2> $(document).ready(function() { should probably be called before you go into the scripting
[18:36:30] <rmill> yep yep!
[18:36:53] <rmill> $(function(){ /* jQuery magic goes here */ });
[18:38:18] * sandyd facepalms again
[18:38:25] <sandyd> that was what was missing.
[18:38:33] <sandyd> This is really my first time using jquery lol
[18:39:03] <NackNick2> happens to us all
[18:39:05] <rmill> sandyd: saaaal good
[18:39:44] * sandyd laughs since she is one of the #ubuntuforums mods, yet she doesn't know javascript that well
[18:50:53] <jonkri> github question: when i upload my jquery application onto github, should i include the jquery and plug-in javascript files that are necessary to use the application?
[18:51:47] <phonebook_> people usually include an example in an index file
[18:52:00] <phonebook_> so in that index file it is hotlinked to jquery
[18:52:23] <jonkri> what if you rely on certain jquery plugins that cannot be hotlinked?
[18:52:44] <phonebook_> then from what i have seen they put those in a subdirectory called js
[18:54:22] <phonebook_> and probably mention the plugin
[18:54:31] <phonebook_> hey, im using a plugin here, cmooon
[18:54:46] <NackNick2> lol sandyd
[18:55:55] <CarlSeagan> hi guys!
[18:55:58] <CarlSeagan> I'm in need of help!
[18:56:06] <CarlSeagan> please! http://jsfiddle.net/Vetc4/
[18:56:18] <CarlSeagan> I want to copy the Tree Slide from Github
[18:56:33] <CarlSeagan> but it isn't working, the (data) is not showing the loaded page
[18:56:42] <CarlSeagan> so when I hit the link, it just loads the page ;-(
[18:57:34] <phonebook_> the page is supposed to slide in from the left?
[18:57:46] <CarlSeagan> yes sir
[18:57:50] <CarlSeagan> like github tree
[18:58:05] <CarlSeagan> You know github? when you use the files there, it slides from the left
[18:58:14] <CarlSeagan> $(window).bind('popstate', function() { 			  $('#slider').slideTo(data) 			})
[18:58:24] <CarlSeagan> this is wrong somehow, I'm passing the "data" but nothing happens
[18:59:07] <phonebook_> i think the problem is slideto
[18:59:22] <phonebook_> what if you load it off screen and use animate?
[18:59:48] <CarlSeagan> mmmm someone told me to use $('#slider').slideTo(location.pathname) instead but It shows the file path
[19:00:07] <phonebook_> there is no slideto in jquery. ...it looks like there is a plugin though
[19:00:25] <CarlSeagan> slideTo = function(data) {
[19:00:34] <CarlSeagan> it slides!
[19:00:41] <CarlSeagan> if I change it to location.pathname it slides
[19:01:04] <CarlSeagan> the only problem is it shows me a file path, instead of the page content I have saved
[19:01:34] <phonebook_> hold on im messing with it
[19:01:41] <phonebook_> btw visual studio 2012 is out!
[19:02:21] <CarlSeagan> ^_^
[19:02:29] <CarlSeagan> This is driving me crazy
[19:02:31] <CarlSeagan> I'm puzzled!
[19:05:12] <subsume> i don't know
[19:05:48] <CarlSeagan> mmm
[19:05:49] <phonebook_> still working. if you click an anchor its just going to load and there is no css keeping it off page
[19:08:15] <CarlSeagan> https://github.com/vanillaforums/jsConnectPHP
[19:08:21] <CarlSeagan> this works, but no idea why
[19:08:23] <CarlSeagan> it is a link...
[19:08:36] <CarlSeagan> they are really slick doing it though
[19:09:16] <phonebook_> i think you are going to need an <iframe> or <object> if you want to load an external site
[19:09:29] <phonebook_> if its internal you can slap some content in a div using ajax or something
[19:09:47] <phonebook_> lets just use an iframe for this example
[19:11:14] <CarlSeagan> that would work!
[19:11:22] <CarlSeagan> how can I do that?
[19:11:35] <phonebook_> easy peasy. will have in a couple minutes
[19:12:08] <CarlSeagan> I thought html(data); was loading the source of the page inside
[19:12:18] <CarlSeagan> $('#slider').html('').append(transfer);
[19:15:17] <phonebook_> couple seconds left. will hopefully be what youw ant
[19:16:05] <cusco> hi
[19:16:52] <cusco> using .ajax(), can the data object/string be like this?
[19:17:43] <cusco> data: { one : 'string' , two : 'another string'},
[19:17:44] <cusco> ?
[19:18:03] <shoky> cusco: yep
[19:18:10] <cusco> well thing is
[19:18:16] <cusco> it worked in chrome at work
[19:18:24] <cusco> but now, I am using chromium on linux
[19:18:27] <cusco> and isn't working
[19:18:37] <shoky> "isn't working" ?
[19:18:37] <cusco> console shows an error with the event ajax
[19:18:46] <shoky> what error
[19:19:00] <cusco> well as it doesn't specify, allow me to take a screen shot
[19:19:17] <shoky> add an error handler to the ajax request
[19:19:28] <shoky> and console.log  the arguments
[19:19:53] <shoky> e.g:  $.ajax(...).fail(function(a,b,c) { console.log(a,b,c) })
[19:20:16] <cusco> ow..
[19:20:17] <shoky> better yet: console.log('ERROR:',a,b,c)
[19:20:29] <cusco> .fail()
[19:22:11] <cusco> now that I changed that and added the .fail()
[19:22:14] <cusco> it worked
[19:22:16] <cusco> !!!
[19:22:17] <cusco> wtf !
[19:22:36] <phonebook_> http://pastebin.com/yL4fjtdn
[19:22:53] <cusco> console was showing > POST ('url') in red
[19:23:28] <phonebook_> do it in safari or chrome - im sure you can change the rest however you want
[19:23:35] <CarlSeagan> mmm works yes!
[19:23:40] <CarlSeagan> But not just what I was looking for
[19:23:59] <CarlSeagan> I was trying to grab the page content with ajax
[19:23:59] <phonebook_> you want it smaller or something?
[19:24:15] <CarlSeagan> that's what $.fn.slideTo = function(data) was doing
[19:24:15] <phonebook_> then load the content into a div and move it the same way
[19:24:24] <phonebook_> or
[19:24:26] <CarlSeagan> this is what this is $.fn.slideTo = function(data)
[19:24:44] <phonebook_> nm
[19:26:11] <CarlSeagan> $(window).bind('popstate', function() {  $('#slider').slideTo(data) })
[19:26:18] <CarlSeagan> the slideTo(data)
[19:26:29] <CarlSeagan> replace data for location.pathname
[19:26:32] <CarlSeagan> and see what I mean
[19:31:45] <MGA555> Are datatables in scope of this channel, or is there another one you could recommend?
[19:36:03] <CarlSeagan> https://github.com/blog/760-the-tree-slider
[19:36:08] <CarlSeagan> this is what i'm trying to do
[19:46:33] <CarlSeagan>  hi! someone here?
[19:46:47] <CarlSeagan> ?
[19:47:19] <CarlSeagan> Someone can give me a hand with this? http://jsfiddle.net/Vetc4/
[19:47:48] <phonebook_> i dont want to bug you more
[19:48:02] <phonebook_> i think the problem is the act of clicking on the anchor which causes the browser to instantly load it
[19:48:07] <phonebook_> look at the url
[19:48:16] <CarlSeagan> you're not buging ;-)
[19:48:23] <CarlSeagan> the act of clicking it is, but it "grabs" the url
[19:48:36] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: preventDefault in the mousedown
[19:48:38] <phonebook_> look at the url. it actually goes to wikipedia

[19:50:15] <phonebook_> maybe use the click on a button
[19:50:43] <phonebook_> $("button").on("click", function() { slideTo(data)  }); // something like that

[19:53:05] <CarlSeagan> yeah I don't think that applies here
[19:53:14] <CarlSeagan> since I'm loading the page into a div
[19:53:20] <CarlSeagan> and then just showing it
[19:53:26] <gnarf> you can't do that with an external page
[19:53:27] <gnarf> ever
[19:53:28] <gnarf> perios
[19:53:29] <gnarf> d
[19:53:42] <gnarf> just saying
[19:53:50] <gnarf> when you pushstate the url that isn't in the same domain
[19:53:58] <gnarf> its possible chrome or whatever is just pushing you to that url because it can
[19:54:45] <gnarf> you shouldn't be trying to ajax or push state cross domainly anyway...
[19:55:06] <CarlSeagan> let me see if I get this straight
[19:56:21] <CarlSeagan> I'm trying to load a page inside my page
[19:56:23] <CarlSeagan> so it won't work
[19:57:11] <gnarf> yes - if that page isn't on the same domain, port and protocol as your page
[19:57:25] <gnarf> ajax across domains is verbotten
[19:57:44] <CarlSeagan> dammit
[19:57:46] <CarlSeagan> but wait
[19:57:51] <CarlSeagan> I try to load another page
[19:57:53] <CarlSeagan> in my domain
[19:57:55] <CarlSeagan> and still doesn't work
[19:57:57] <CarlSeagan> how is it?
[19:59:28] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: there are a few errors (like wtf is data in the popstate handler)
[19:59:29] <CarlSeagan> I try to load a php in my site and 1) It doesn't slides and 2) it shows up suddenly and if it's a php, it shows as a text dump
[19:59:48] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: and 2) you're in way over your head
[19:59:59] <CarlSeagan> I'm trying to grab pull what this guy did: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5419469/github-slider-jquery-plugin
[20:00:33] <CarlSeagan> I know, I don't want to learn to write jquery from scratch, just trying to pull this one
[20:01:18] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: sorry, ask the author then -- it's just a "snippet" example of whats hapening, and I don't think you're using the pushstate api properly either
[20:02:04] <CarlSeagan> mmm damn. Don't worry, will keep asking here then. Someone may show up.
[20:02:08] <CarlSeagan> Thanks anyway! ;-D
[20:02:40] <CarlSeagan> another way of having a link slide a page?
[20:02:46] <CarlSeagan> you can think of? That's the best I found
[20:02:59] <CarlSeagan> I'm trying to "imitate" the iphone effect
[20:03:15] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: I can think of a million, and have implemented a few in the past, and it's never been fun or easy
[20:03:41] <gnarf> its really really easy to take a giant div and slide it
[20:03:49] <CarlSeagan> oh yes, that's easy
[20:04:02] <CarlSeagan> but to have a page content in it?
[20:04:09] <gnarf> same as any div
[20:04:15] <gnarf> if you css it correctly
[20:04:26] <gnarf> you are trying to tackle two problems at once
[20:04:38] <CarlSeagan> yes but I'm trying to have you click a link and the content of, wikipedia for example, slide
[20:04:38] <gnarf> #1) Loading the "other page" into the "current page"
[20:04:52] <gnarf> and #2) a "slide" transition between the two content divs
[20:05:08] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: why is your "for example" an external link?
[20:05:20] <CarlSeagan> has to be an external link
[20:05:28] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: then this idea is doomed to never working

[20:06:04] <gnarf> unless you want to start mucking with iframes

[20:06:10] <gnarf> you're REALLY on your own

[20:06:38] <CarlSeagan> what about a link on the same server then?
[20:06:41] <CarlSeagan> say another page on the same server
[20:06:53] <CarlSeagan> say I want to load a .php file of the same server (games.php)
[20:06:55] <gnarf> its possible, but you need to solve two problems
[20:07:00] <CarlSeagan> and I just click the link
[20:07:00] <gnarf> #1) get the "other page"
[20:07:10] <gnarf> #2) slide transition
[20:08:18] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: you'll have to think about things like - what is the "content" portion, what needs to change in navigation elements, what parts of the site stick around, do you need javascript to be executed on the new content - etc
[20:09:26] <gnarf> this is not a simple problem, you will be trying to solve it for a few days - and noone is going to have a "magic bullet" that solves your problem
[20:09:44] <gnarf> you have 0 parts of this equation actually working
[20:10:34] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: now - you can get some inspiration for tackling the "slide transition" and dealing with the "history api" from that stack overflow post
[20:10:47] <gnarf> but there are a lot more nuiances to the history api you should spend some time with
[20:11:16] <gnarf> oh, history api -- thats a 3rd "problem"
[20:11:36] <gnarf> if you could get history / ajax nav working without a transition
[20:11:42] <alexr2> Sounds like someone needs to practice regular javascript/html/css before moving on to jQuery :-P
[20:11:44] <gnarf> then adding a transition shouldn't be too terribly difficult
[20:12:30] <CarlSeagan> by the way
[20:12:37] <CarlSeagan> http://www.cabrerabrothers.com
[20:12:42] <CarlSeagan> just published our first indie game
[20:12:50] <CarlSeagan> if someone wants to check it out, it has some nice jquery on the page
[20:12:53] <CarlSeagan> you'll love it
[20:13:06] <CarlSeagan> if you wait at the top, there is a blimp moving on the window ;-D
[20:13:13] <alexr2> http://www.mywot.com/en/scorecard/cabrerabrothers.com?utm_source=addon&utm_content=rw-viewsc
[20:13:18] <alexr2> Pretty poorly rated :-P
[20:14:03] <CarlSeagan> alex?
[20:14:04] <CarlSeagan> so?
[20:14:18] <CarlSeagan> never heard about that mywot
[20:14:21] <CarlSeagan> just now
[20:14:27] <CarlSeagan> didn't even knew they existed
[20:14:37] <alexr2> You recommend we go to a site that can possibly steal our personal info...
[20:14:38] <CarlSeagan> in fact, I'm going to email them right now asking to take us out of their page.
[20:14:45] <alexr2> lol... you go ahead and do that...
[20:14:58] <CarlSeagan> ? that's my site man it has been on kotaku, penny arcade, etc
[20:15:00] <bot-t> CarlSeagan, Couldn't find "that's my site man it has been on kotaku, penny arcade, etc" in jQuery Docs.
[20:15:56] <CarlSeagan> stupidiest thing I ever heard
[20:16:04] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: if you wrote that site and don't know about the same origin policy... damn... :)
[20:16:48] <CarlSeagan> it's a fairly simpel site, just some jquery animations and css3 transitions
[20:16:57] <gnarf> also, if you did the animation on the home page there, figuring out how to slide two boxes in a page should be pretty easy
[20:17:14] <CarlSeagan> I don't know about that because this is the first time I ever tried to get data from a page to insert it into the one I'm using....
[20:17:19] <alexr2> I'm not saying you didn't create an awesome, amazing, super cool site.. I'm just saying a fairly reliable source online (in my experience) states that the site is unsafe
[20:17:42] <CarlSeagan> unsafe in which way?
[20:17:43] <gnarf> why don't you start out by having two "content pages" on one page - with one hidden, and get the animate working
[20:18:05] <alexr2> No clue, not interested in finding out.
[20:20:15] <gnarf> thats a decent problem
[20:20:23] <gnarf> the ajax stuff there should be some examples of doing like "ajax tabs"
[20:20:36] <gnarf> ?g jquery ajax tabs pushstate
[20:20:38] <bot-t> gnarf, Ben Alman  jQuery BBQ  Examples  hashchange  jQuery UI Tabs - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/fragment-jquery-ui-tabs/
[20:20:41] <gnarf> nah
[20:20:58] <CarlSeagan> hahaha this site is just stupid. WOT... just checked it, they wanted me to "claim" my own site by adding a meta tag
[20:21:05] <gnarf> http://www.seomoz.org/blog/create-crawlable-link-friendly-ajax-websites-using-pushstate
[20:21:16] <CarlSeagan> blackmailing devs won't get them more links
[20:21:34] <CarlSeagan> fuck em. If they want to rate it low, so be it. We have plenty of sales and the site is legit.
[20:22:10] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: ^^^ that link could help
[20:22:30] <CarlSeagan> that must be the most stupid reaction I ever seen. "No, this other site claims is unsafe.". Good luck browsing the internet mate.
[20:22:35] <alexr2> CarlSeagan, I think you misunderstand the point of the WOT.  It's not meant to get you more internet traffic or link backs or anything like that... It's meant to warn new users of any bad experiences (or good ones) that other users have had on your site.
[20:22:45] <CarlSeagan> gnarf: ! Thanks! checking it right now
[20:23:33] <gnarf> also CarlSeagan know that push/popstate and history API are IE10+ features
[20:23:39] <CarlSeagan> alexr2: BLA BLA BLA, trying to blackmail devs by assigning a low value to a site trust is just shady to me. Go ahead, live your life by their standards, I don't care. You're not going to buy my game anyway so why do you waste your time?
[20:23:47] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: http://caniuse.com/history
[20:23:53] <alexr2> lol.. okay
[20:24:01] <CarlSeagan> what a troll.. for god's sake.
[20:24:04] <CarlSeagan> Kids never learn, do they.
[20:24:30] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: focus on the jquery stuff, ignore the "troll"
[20:24:31] <alexr2> lol...
[20:24:33] <CarlSeagan> Childish behavior. Then you call yourself a man. Go go! Ask them what site to visit next!
[20:24:38] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: please
[20:24:45] <CarlSeagan> gnarf: alright, will focus.
[20:25:04] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: not sure if you're willing to rule out IE9 and below
[20:25:06] <CarlSeagan> just that these idiots know how to make me mad... site trust. For god's sake.
[20:25:17] <CarlSeagan> nope, just chrome and ff
[20:25:25] <CarlSeagan> We drop IE long time ago here
[20:25:32] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: to be fair, my anti virus let me know that you had 4 services tracking my visit
[20:25:33] <gnarf> :)
[20:25:59] <CarlSeagan> 4? I have 2, google analytics and statcounter
[20:26:13] <gnarf> + twitter + facebook connect
[20:26:15] <CarlSeagan> which one show?
[20:26:27] <CarlSeagan> ohhh must be because of the ShareThis buttons
[20:26:31] <gnarf> you snaked my facebook cookies too
[20:26:34] <CarlSeagan> it has pininterest as well
[20:26:37] <gnarf> :)
[20:26:44] <gnarf> thats prolly what WOT has issues with
[20:26:51] <gnarf> its an automated metrics system obviously
[20:26:58] <CarlSeagan> yes, ShareThis! uses these
[20:27:05] <CarlSeagan> want to see something cool in jquery: check this out
[20:27:07] <gnarf> might be worth asking them what they exactly consider "unsafe" about it and try to fix the issues
[20:27:14] <CarlSeagan> http://www.cabrerabrothers.com/soundtrack_noir
[20:27:18] <CarlSeagan> that's the sountrack demo for the game
[20:27:24] <CarlSeagan> see how the CD spins
[20:27:33] <gnarf> you might learn about stuff you didn't realize was possibly hurting the end-users of your site
[20:27:48] <CarlSeagan> wait, second
[20:28:12] <CarlSeagan> there
[20:28:15] <CarlSeagan> changed it last night
[20:28:44] <alexr2> gnarf, are you on chrome?  Check out the Collusion extension
[20:30:26] <gnarf> alexr2: i don't run any extensions for development reasons but i've seen it and it looks nice - might consider it on the other pc
[20:30:54] <gnarf> some extensions are just badly done and interferre with the jQuery test suites
[20:31:03] <CarlSeagan> just checked, they don't have ANY way to contact them. They just say that in order to change your raiting, you must go into their community and actually participate in the scam
[20:31:20] * gnarf shrugs
[20:31:27] <gnarf>  I doubt jQuery ever did any of that
[20:31:31] <gnarf> and we have a 95%
[20:31:54] <alexr2> gnarf, so do 99% of sites :-P  Which is why I stay away from anything that isn't up there
[20:32:10] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: prolly something one of your "services" is doing with its cookies/data
[20:32:32] <CarlSeagan> I have to contact them to sales@mywot.com
[20:32:38] <alexr2> CarlSeagan, I'm not saying there's anything actually wrong with your site... I'm just saying that it's rated poorly by an open community.
[20:32:52] <alexr2> For all I know your website is perfectly safe
[20:34:07] <alexr2> And the mail service you use is 1 step away from plain old pure spam
[20:34:22] <CarlSeagan> ? mailchimp?
[20:34:23] <bot-t> CarlSeagan, JQUERY BUBBLE POPUP v.2 - jQuery Plugins - Create easily smart bubble popups with only a line of code in jQuery! http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jqBubblePopup
[20:34:25] <alexr2> Yes
[20:34:28] <CarlSeagan> why?
[20:34:40] <gnarf> also, CarlSeagan -- curious to know if you've tried jQuery 1.8.2 on that site
[20:34:41] <CarlSeagan> They are leaders in the market
[20:34:46] <alexr2> Your site -> Mailchimp.com -> quantserve.com
[20:34:49] <CarlSeagan> nope, just that one
[20:35:03] <CarlSeagan> quantserve.com?
[20:35:06] <CarlSeagan> don't understand
[20:35:43] <CarlSeagan> http://www.cabrerabrothers.com/soundtrack_noir/ just hit the play
[20:35:47] <CarlSeagan> then enjoy
[20:35:54] <CarlSeagan> see what happens
[20:35:56] <CarlSeagan> live in danger
[20:36:19] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: 1.8.2 ? you ever try it on the site?
[20:36:21] <alexr2> I prefer to live in a bubble
[20:36:37] <CarlSeagan> gnarf: nope, I have 1.7 I believe
[20:36:42] <CarlSeagan> from when it came out, a month ago
[20:36:43] <CarlSeagan> or so
[20:36:44] <gnarf> 1.7.2
[20:36:47] <CarlSeagan> yes
[20:36:49] <CarlSeagan> why?
[20:36:53] <CarlSeagan> security?
[20:37:12] <gnarf> no, just wondering how the performance of that animation looks in 1.8.2
[20:37:44] <gnarf> I rewrote a good portion of the animate stuff between 1.7.2 and 1.8
[20:38:32] <gnarf> it just seems like an effects heavy page that could potentially show a break/perf change
[20:38:37] <CarlSeagan> changed it to 1.8
[20:38:48] <CarlSeagan> just now ;-D
[20:39:06] <gnarf> seems similar
[20:39:12] <gnarf> which is good :)
[20:39:34] <chee> i used to work with a guy called gnarf
[20:39:55] <CarlSeagan> changed it back
[20:39:58] <CarlSeagan> it was a bit jumpy
[20:40:05] <gnarf> then he spent 14 hours a day on jQuery :)
[20:40:11] <chee> ;D
[20:40:26] <CarlSeagan> yes it was a bit jumpy, a bit choppy with the 1.8 here
[20:41:57] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: i was just looking at the profiles between the two -- some interesting things pop up
[20:42:02] <gnarf> i think the slowness is actually in selectors
[20:42:05] <gnarf> not animate
[20:42:20] <CarlSeagan> in the selectors?
[20:42:29] <CarlSeagan> the css3 you mean
[20:42:50] <CarlSeagan> there were other effects there I had to take away. They were ratter cool though. I had the background of the characters scroll like crazy in X
[20:42:53] <CarlSeagan> was like if they were moving
[20:43:00] <CarlSeagan> Fuuushhhhhh! flying on the X axis
[20:43:07] <CarlSeagan> like those japanese animations
[20:43:20] <CarlSeagan> was choppy as fuck though. When you scrolled your page down (big images...maybe?)
[20:44:17] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: you ever look at the profiles tab in chrome dev tools?
[20:44:20] <CarlSeagan> still thinking why mailchimp is one step from spam
[20:44:29] <CarlSeagan> I was going to use campaign monitor
[20:44:33] <CarlSeagan> but now I'm thinking amazon SES
[20:45:55] <CarlSeagan> the img take 355
[20:45:57] <CarlSeagan> 35%
[20:46:34] <CarlSeagan> yknow
[20:47:31] <alexr2> CarlSeagan, http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/apr/23/quantcast-tracking-trackers-cookies-web-monitoring, Cookie stored from mailchimp -> quantserve
[20:49:28] <CarlSeagan> mmm still don't read anything about spam there, just a company that tracks profiles for marketing purposes to bigger companies
[20:49:35] <JonahSchulte> I've had really good experiences with Campaign Monitor, FWIW
[20:49:47] <CarlSeagan> Yes, I've seen their site, is much more cooler than mailchimp
[20:49:56] <CarlSeagan> I'm thinking about moving
[20:50:07] <alexr2> Regular tracking is fine, they have a history of doing illegal things to track you
[20:50:09] <CarlSeagan> I would just like to know exactly why
[20:50:18] <CarlSeagan> and mailchimp uses them?
[20:50:48] <CarlSeagan> dude, the united states government is having a PC in some big ass basement right now (probably running windows ME) logging this very chat.
[20:51:02] <CarlSeagan> right-now-exact-this-second
[20:51:04] <alexr2> That's how I got their quantcast's link
[20:51:29] <JonahSchulte> That windows ME box better have a big hard drive
[20:51:39] <CarlSeagan> 400mb
[20:51:44] <CarlSeagan> used for 2 things
[20:51:46] <JonahSchulte> should be plenty for anyone
[20:51:48] <CarlSeagan> storing peopel's chat logs
[20:51:48] <JonahSchulte> :-p
[20:51:58] <CarlSeagan> and storing photos of george bush masturbating his dogs
[20:52:07] <JonahSchulte> not enough space to fit all of those
[20:52:12] <CarlSeagan> lol
[20:52:32] <CarlSeagan> now that's an imagen I didn't need while drunk... damn.
[20:53:10] <CarlSeagan> everyone says aweber or something like that but I would put first campaign monitor, then mailchimp, then amazon and THEN anything else
[20:53:14] <CarlSeagan> I was thinking on amazon
[20:53:16] <CarlSeagan> SES
[20:53:19] <CarlSeagan> with SENDY
[20:53:24] <CarlSeagan> know it? Sendy? the app?
[20:53:52] <CarlSeagan> uses jquery
[20:54:00] <alexr2> CarlSeagan, you call me immature, yet you ask me how a company is linked to spam.  I give you an answer.  And you mock me for it?
[20:55:16] <CarlSeagan> Was doing some funny comment about the issue, that's all. I'm actually thinking on moving to Campaign Monitor.
[20:55:34] <CarlSeagan> Sorry if it came out the wrong way
[20:55:45] <CarlSeagan> if you want to, we can go outside to the Thunder Dome
[20:56:01] <CarlSeagan> two men enter, one man leaves
[20:56:34] <CarlSeagan> But honestly, now that you bring the subject to the table about mailchimp being implied in that, I think we'll move to campaign
[20:56:53] <CarlSeagan> or Amazon. But campaign monitor seems more reliable... for now.
[20:57:32] <CarlSeagan> I'm just scared of trusting amazon with mails. They are becoming too big, too google. Someone may buy them in the future...
[20:59:05] <CarlSeagan> you cool alexr2 ?
[20:59:09] <gnarf> CarlSeagan: we have probably 500 computers logging this chat....
[20:59:19] <gnarf> i know i have 3
[20:59:19] <CarlSeagan> gnarf: yes, scary but true.
[20:59:20] <gnarf> :)
[20:59:25] <CarlSeagan> and with windows me
[20:59:33] <gnarf> whats windows?
[20:59:40] <gnarf> :)
[20:59:51] <CarlSeagan> you wrote the jquery animation for the last one
[20:59:54] <CarlSeagan> man what an honor
[21:00:00] <CarlSeagan> I used the last one in other projects
[21:00:03] <CarlSeagan> but not on this one
[21:00:30] <CarlSeagan> alexr2: you okay dude?
[21:01:19] <CarlSeagan> he's okay
[21:01:23] <gnarf> effects 1.8 was a fun project
[21:01:34] <gnarf> couple of late nights with chee
[21:01:35] <gnarf> ;)
[21:02:03] <gnarf> chee: you can be like "i was there when jquery 1.8 effects.js was written"
[21:02:05] <gnarf> :)
[21:02:28] <CarlSeagan> jquery changed the web
[21:02:29] <CarlSeagan> really
[21:05:35] <JonahSchulte> Wow, I love this regex:
[21:05:36] <JonahSchulte> urlParseRE: /^(((([^:\/#\?]+:)?(?:(\/\/)((?:(([^:@\/#\?]+)(?:\:([^:@\/#\?]+))?)@)?(([^:\/#\?\]\[]+|\[[^\/\]@#?]+\])(?:\:([0-9]+))?))?)?)?((\/?(?:[^\/\?#]+\/+)*)([^\?#]*)))?(\?[^#]+)?)(#.*)?/,
[21:05:39] <JonahSchulte> :)
[21:05:56] <JonahSchulte> It's like a love letter from complexity
[21:06:17] <gnarf> JonahSchulte: why not just use an <a> tag to parse the URL parts?
[21:06:52] <JonahSchulte> It parses a URL like this:
[21:06:53] <JonahSchulte> http://jblas:password@mycompany.com:8080/mail/inbox?msg=1234&type=unread#msg-content
[21:06:55] <JonahSchulte> into 17 parts
[21:07:02] <JonahSchulte> it's in jQuery Mobile
[21:07:24] <scar> lol
[21:07:33] <scar> best place to dive head first into regex?
[21:08:09] <coldhead> mastering regular expressions http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565922570.do
[21:08:19] <CarlSeagan> damn I feel bad for alexr2. I'm a bit drunk and I think I hurt the guy a bit.
[21:08:29] <CarlSeagan> I'm a peaceful chap, I didn't wanted to hurt his feelings.
[21:08:35] <CarlSeagan> Hey alexr2 are you around mate?
[21:09:12] <coldhead> don't sweat it, CarlSeagan. it's just IRC. he's probably sipping a a beer and looking at naked people
[21:09:22] <CarlSeagan> Someone know him? to reach him?
[21:09:47] <CarlSeagan> damn. I have to stop drinking on Fridays. Not a kid anymore.
[21:11:12] <chee> gnarf: ;D!
[21:11:27] <gnarf> joeytwiddle: http://jsbin.com/ixepet/1/edit
[21:11:34] <gnarf> damn
[21:11:36] <CarlSeagan> chee
[21:11:37] <gnarf> jonah took off
[21:11:38] <CarlSeagan> thanks for jquery mate
[21:12:14] <chee> yw
[21:14:02] <mouses> i'm trying to get the index of a class of <a> collections when the link is clicked... something like:  $.each($(".myclass"), function(index, value){  $(this).click(function(){ // some code } ...
[21:14:34] <mouses> i cant get the logic right, there should be an easy way, no?
[21:14:44] <gnarf> mouses: um
[21:14:51] <gnarf> mouses: please state again what you want?
[21:15:14] <gnarf> you want to know when you click on an object - its index in a collection?
[21:15:27] <mouses> yes
[21:15:39] <CarlSeagan> thanks gnarf for your help
[21:15:52] <gnarf> var collection = $(".myclass"); collection.click(function() { console.log( collection.index( this ) ); }); ?
[21:17:18] <gnarf> ?index
[21:17:19] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[21:18:21] <mouses> hold on lemme try
[21:19:27] <gnarf> also mouses $(".myclass").each( callback ) works too
[21:23:09] <mouses> to use index(), i would need to store the class collection into a var, no?
[21:23:29] <gnarf> mouses: not nessecarily
[21:23:36] <gnarf> you could search for the whole collection every time
[21:23:49] <gnarf> i was just saving the var to stop from having to look for the same collection twice
[21:24:05] <gnarf> if its going to change, search again, otherwise - best practice is to cache your selections
[21:25:21] <mouses> how would i get the index without storing the collection as a var?
[21:25:45] <gnarf> mouses: $(".myclass").index( this ) ?
[21:25:52] <gnarf> mouses: really?
[21:26:21] <gnarf> mouses: if the result of ".myclass" won't change - use the var
[21:26:27] <mouses> i tried something like that before i came in here and it said index wasnt a method or something... hold on lemme try aain
[21:26:50] <gnarf> mouses: jQuery objects definitely have an index method
[21:29:49] <Lucky--> http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2012/10/01/internet-data-cap/1595683/ wtf if you use time warner or comcast and you are a power user you are farked.
[21:31:23] <mouses> $(".myclass").click(function(){  console.log("this: " + this.index()); ...        the collection is a group of <a> elements and the error is:  "[localhost url...] has no method 'index' "
[21:31:43] <gnarf> no shit
[21:32:00] <gnarf> this.index() !== $("myclass").index(this)
[21:32:13] <gnarf> this has no method called index because its a DOM element, not a jQuery object
[21:32:34] <gnarf> i also missed the "." on that myclass
[21:32:58] <gnarf> but hopefully you don't need me to type that a fourth time :)
[21:33:46] <mouses> ok that makes sense, lemme try
[21:43:07] <mouses> thanks bro that worked
[21:43:33] <mouses> let me put it in a var and ask u if its the most efficient logic
[21:51:02] <mouses> ok my code is efficient now
[21:54:07] <scar> you know, i heard this guy talking about jquery being the 'cakephp' of javascript...
[21:54:12] <scar> uhhh, how offensive is that? lol
[21:58:32] * gnarf shrugs
[21:59:16] <gnarf> Seems like a poor metaphor tho
[22:00:05] <gnarf> cake isn't a terrible framework
[22:00:45] <gnarf> but i dont see how it is anything like jQuery
[22:01:58] <coldhead> it makes JS more palatable in the way that cakephp makes php more palatable
[22:02:15] <coldhead> and rolling excrement in glitter makes it more uh palatable
[22:03:53] <scar> so you think cakephp is the jquery equivalent of php?
[22:04:18] <scar> ie. cakephp:php as jquery:javascript
[22:04:52] <shoky> who cares
[22:06:04] <CarlSeagan> gnarf: you there mate
[22:12:56] <CarlSeagan> someone else?
[22:14:48] <CarlSeagan> mom?
[22:17:12] <barraponto> m here
[22:17:19] <barraponto> not your mom, though
[22:17:19] <CarlSeagan> oh thanks god
[22:17:20] <CarlSeagan> I was scared
[22:20:27] <CarlSeagan> any idea how to replicate the github slider?
[22:30:34] <barraponto> jquery mobile does it
[22:30:37] <barraponto> take a look.
[22:35:32] <CarlSeagan> I don't feel like I should be loading all the jquery mobile api for just the links
[22:35:49] <CarlSeagan> and in chrome doesn't slides, it "fades out"
[22:36:19] <CarlSeagan> you know something similar that works on browsers like the github does/
[22:36:20] <CarlSeagan> ?
[22:37:24] <CarlSeagan> it doens't slides in safari either
[22:37:29] <CarlSeagan> maybe I'm missing somehting? ;-p
