[00:02:49] <aminpy> how can I send post request with jquery?
[00:04:37] <Solidem> aminpy, have you tried google?
[00:04:44] <ryanseddon> aminpy: $.post()
[00:04:51] <Solidem> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[00:05:00] <Solidem> google: "jquery post"
[00:05:19] <aminpy> Solidem, should I use .post or .ajax?
[00:05:53] <ryanseddon> $.post is a convenience method for $.ajax
[00:06:35] <Solidem> yeah, go with $.post if that's what you're looking for

[00:48:07] <jeroenem> hi how to do something like this? if class ui-tabs-selected - hide img.image-1 / show img.image-2
[00:49:19] <CKIDOW> which image/file upload workaround do you recommend?
[00:49:22] <CKIDOW> swf or iframe?
[00:50:02] <CKIDOW> it's not answerable in general i know but I wanna see some opinions
[00:50:48] <ablomen> CKIDOW, i'd go for something that uses html5 if available, and falls back to whatever other option is left
[00:51:19] <ablomen> something like plupload (which i have not used myself, but looks quite nice)
[00:54:06] <coldhead> ?g blueimp github upload
[00:54:07] <bot-t1> coldhead, blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload - GitHub - https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[00:54:16] <stan_man_can> will toggle always show/hide or can you do something custome?
[00:54:17] <coldhead> CKIDOW: that guy ^^
[00:54:25] <stan_man_can> i want to toggle between two background images when clicked
[00:54:38] <CKIDOW> plupload looks nice on first sight
[00:54:49] <CKIDOW> thx for recommendation
[00:55:00] <stan_man_can> CKIDOW: i've used plupload a few times and quite enjoy it
[01:01:35] <stan_man_can> http://pastebin.com/AEtzNq5X
[01:01:39] <stan_man_can> Whats wrong with that?
[01:01:53] <stan_man_can> if i do an alert it works properly
[01:03:29] <CKIDOW> okay plupload is great for mutliple file/image uploads
[01:03:34] <markj> ?css @ stan_man_can
[01:03:34] <bot-t1> stan_man_can, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[01:03:43] <CKIDOW> what do you recomend for a single imge upload?
[01:03:59] <CKIDOW> just select the image and click on upload
[01:04:09] <CKIDOW> maybe there is a more simpler solution
[01:05:45] <stan_man_can> markj: ah thanks, it was actually me not setting with url(dir) and trying just dir
[01:05:47] <stan_man_can> thanks though
[01:06:59] <Hierofant> jQuery(this). ?

[01:08:02] <Hierofant> thats what I thought, markj
[01:08:06] <Hierofant> oh nm, he left
[01:08:16] <Hierofant> I think he's messed up his selectors
[01:08:38] <Hierofant> ah url
[01:08:48] <markj> open a console with jquery on and type $===jQuery, its true, just to make the point

[01:13:25] <fire> hi how can i insert content before first li
[01:13:32] <fire> $('.viUI_livebox-holder li:first').before(); ?
[01:15:42] <Solidem> how do I break down "theuser@thedomain.com" into variables (var user = 'theuser'; var domain= 'thedomain.com')
[01:16:40] <markj> ?mdc split @ Solidem
[01:16:42] <bot-t1> Solidem, split - MDC Docs - Splits a String object into an array of strings by separating the string into substrings. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split
[01:16:50] <johanhar> Hi. If I got a bunch of <input> fiels with attribute name with the same value (on that name attribute). How can I get them all into an array to manipulate
[01:17:13] <Solidem> mdc?
[01:17:31] <Solidem> tnx, will look into the split. looked like it returned a new string, with commas.. not an array
[01:19:39] <markj> mdc is just a command for the bot Solidem
[01:19:50] <Solidem> hehe allright, tnx
[01:20:37] <Hierofant> too bad theres no strtoarray
[01:21:50] <blackspotwiggins> Hierofant, .split("") is basically that
[01:28:36] <mazzachre> I have http://jsfiddle.net/2YfYF/1/ now. Can I prevet the last '&' when there are no parameters? (I know it is only cosmetical here)
[01:36:42] <ravenzz> mazzachre check the length?
[01:38:49] <mazzachre> ravenzz: It is not an array
[01:40:53] <markj> ?eval 'a string'.length
[01:40:54] <bot-t1> markj: 8
[01:41:08] <Zebra10> seems like the data function isn't converting Array strings on data attributes
[01:41:10] <Zebra10> any ideas?
[01:41:25] <Zebra10> (converting to array objects)
[01:42:49] <Zebra10> oh... using single quotes to wrap the values on the data object doesn't work - needs to be double quotes. didn't think valid JSON cared which quotes were used
[01:53:02] <ruby_on_tails> i have a json request done, one of the nodes is a JS code which i want to exectue on the page, how can i do tht ?

[02:05:38] <wao> hello, if I've got lot of options in select menu in jquerymobile and some mobile devices got problem renders it, is there some idea for workaround? :)
[02:06:47] <markj> wao you'll probably have to be a bit more specific than 'some mobile devices' :]
[02:06:49] <johanhar> Hi. Can I not use multiple selectors at once? Like this one, it does find all :radio but when I also add :selected it finds none (even tho I selected one of the radios): $("input:radio:selected")
[02:07:18] <markj> :checked is what you want johanhar
[02:07:24] <johanhar> Ah thanks
[02:07:33] <markj> the very first sentence of the docs for :selected says it doesnt work for radio inputs
[02:07:38] <markj> http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[02:10:18] <seutje> docs... so overrated
[02:12:57] <Guest36718> A part avec JQueryUI est ce quelqu'un connait des effets sympas et discrets pour jquery ?
[02:13:07] <wao> markj: iphone 3GS
[02:13:37] <wao> markj: but galaxy s got problems too, needs more time to load the page with that huge select :/
[02:15:18] <Guest36718> Except in JQuery UI, do you know other effects (simple & soft) for jquery.
[02:15:22] <markj> unfortunately ive not really used jqmobile much dude, was just trying to get you to give more info to the channel :] im going to guess its not something that you can workaround though, any way to change how the menu works or does it need to be done like it is?
[02:22:10] <smartFun> if I use $('#container1').load('index.html #container2'), than I have always to containers in my html document -> #container1 and inside #container2, how can I load in container1 only the content of #container2 directly?
[02:22:20] <smartFun> to=two
[02:26:03] <kostodo> How can I make a selector that only applies to a div.class if that div has children, otherwise nothing
[02:26:21] <lugzer> hi
[02:26:24] <johanhar> Hi, is this the right way to add a option tag to a select tag? Select tag has id=megler_id. $("#megler_id").append($("<option>").attr("selected", true).attr("value", "Hahahah"));
[02:26:49] <johanhar> It does not work... :(
[02:27:53] <lugzer> does anyone know a plugin for jQ UI Datepicker that allows to select date range on ONE calendar? (pick first date, pick second, show selected range).. google doesn't know that (there's independent one, but i want to use a plugin)
[02:29:18] <Superman_> ..
[02:29:55] <liquid-silence> anyone here know of good layout plugins for jquery?
[02:30:08] <liquid-silence> I want header / left / right but with split panels
[02:30:51] <johanhar> what is a layout plugin?:P sounds to me as you want to use something like a framework, for php or ruby etc :P
[02:30:56] <CKIDOW> i ask my self how this is jquery related?
[02:31:29] <CKIDOW> try Ruby on Rails 9 / 3.1 :D
[02:31:41] <CKIDOW> and sproudcore
[02:32:35] <eml> kostodo: You could write that as a plugin or simply check .length
[02:33:20] <kostodo> eml: how do you check length of children?
[02:34:18] <eml> Just guessing but .children().length seems like it would work
[02:34:39] <smellyhippy> lo all :) I've been trying to find a way of doing something before validation (with jquery.validate.js) but I can't seem to find anything reasonable. The best I could find is this dude: http://desertrose.posterous.com/jquery-validator-before-validation-callback whos actually wanting it for the same reason i do, however I don't like the solution of editing the script ... it makes updating alot
[02:34:39] <smellyhippy> more painful
[02:34:44] <eml> $(selector).children().length
[02:36:53] <kostodo> eml: thanks
[02:39:12] <VictorCl2> hallow
[02:39:34] <VictorCl2> hey someone told me that it was not necesary to put $.live inside document.ready ?
[02:39:36] <VictorCl2> is it true?
[02:39:52] <johanhar> Can someone look at this please? http://pastebin.com/tQm32nJL
[02:40:28] <Tant102> VictorCl2, it's probably unnecessary since it will affect anything after your code, so you can do it at loading and it will still affect those created at document.ready.
[02:41:22] <VictorCl2> johanhar try  var o = $("option:selected").text();  $("#megler_id").append(o);
[02:41:58] <johanhar> I am creating a new option tag, not doing something with an existing one :)
[02:42:26] <johanhar> I am trying to append to an empty select tag, a new option tag
[02:42:54] <ryrych> hello
[02:45:16] <liquid-silence> johanhar http://layout.jquery-dev.net/demos.cfm
[02:46:42] <smellyhippy> hey liquid-silence ;)
[02:46:50] <ryrych> having two instances of a jQuery UI plugin: A & B, being inside A (â€˜thisâ€™ refers to A), how can I pass â€˜thisâ€™ to the B so that â€˜thisâ€™ refers to B instance?
[02:47:02] <ryrych> (missing ajpiano & gnarf)
[02:47:22] <liquid-silence> smellyhippy what are you doing with jquery
[02:48:33] <johanhar> Can someone look at this please? http://pastebin.com/tQm32nJL -  I try to make a new option tag, and append it to the select tag with id=megler_id.
[02:48:48] <smellyhippy> liquid-silence: I want to do something before validation occurs ... I was having toruble finding a way ... i found something that deswcribed editing the source script but thats sucks ... found somehting else now that modifies each validation method to do what i want first ... that seems less smelly ... still a bit hacky though
[02:48:55] <ryrych> I store A & Bâ€™s â€˜this.elementâ€™ in global variable (inside $.ui.foo.global)
[02:55:25] <smellyhippy> for anyone who cares I came across this answer and it'#s what I'm going with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1827483/jquery-validate-plugin-how-to-trim-values-before-form-validation
[02:55:41] <smellyhippy> it's not perfect but it lets the issue pass validation ... I'll just have to remember to trim serverside too

[03:01:05] <z3yo> Hi there
[03:01:20] <z3yo> How to clone <script> with JQuery ?
[03:04:00] <lugzer> hey in jQ UI datepicker, when i try to add class to a current element within the datepicker table, it gets erased.. why is that?
[03:06:13] <jomofcw> z3yo what do you really want to do ? Cloning script is a non-sense
[03:06:25] <jomofcw> lugzer how do you add this class ?
[03:07:06] <z3yo> jomofcw I really need it
[03:07:27] <jomofcw> z3yo yea probably, but just explain what you're trying to do
[03:07:32] <jomofcw> and we could help you tehn.
[03:07:34] <jomofcw> then
[03:09:47] <lugzer> jomofcw, http://jsfiddle.net/57btE/ -- simple like that... but it looks like the calendar gets redrawn...
[03:10:49] <jomofcw> Yea it should be redraw, perhaps you could use the live method on the parent of the datepicker ?
[03:11:24] <lugzer> jomofcw, that's a good point. thanks, i'll try that!
[03:13:02] <lugzer> jomofcw, i thought i'd be able to pick 2 dates, add classes to the range between and let css to the rest.. looks like it's more complicated and i gotta do that apart from jQ UI datepicker, wanted to do that onSelect.. you know
[03:13:04] <SilentPenguin> z3yo, why are you trying to clone a script tag in the first place?
[03:13:12] <jomofcw> lugzer really not sure that will help but I've not any other idea at the moment :s.
[03:13:28] <sint> hey, i am using attr('href", url) from jquery to change a href link. it works nice in all browsers except IE7. for some reason the link appears different even if the given url is the same. anyone know how to fix this?
[03:13:58] <sint> oops, i just mixed up the ' with ", but its ok in the source
[03:14:29] <lugzer> jomofcw, no probs just chattin
[03:16:06] <jomofcw> sint what the expected result, and what do you get in IE7 ?
[03:16:32] <sint> jomofcw: just a sec, i'll paste something
[03:17:35] <jomofcw> sint OK
[03:17:46] <ruby_on_tails> i am doing a simple getJSON and inside the callback funtion i am alerting a HI but it doesnt work
[03:18:07] <jomofcw> ruby_on_tails the alert isn't fired ?
[03:18:17] <ruby_on_tails> $.getJSON(url, function(data) { alert("hi"); });
[03:18:18] <jomofcw> ruby_on_tails jsfiddle your code.
[03:18:29] <ruby_on_tails> jomofcw: no, but i see the requests and data in firebug perfectly fine
[03:18:31] <jomofcw> ? getJSON()
[03:18:41] <blackspotwiggins> ruby_on_tails, if you are doing crossdomain json, it wont work
[03:18:43] <jomofcw> no more bots here..
[03:18:50] <ruby_on_tails> blackspotwiggins: its the same domain
[03:18:51] <Woet> bot-t passed away yesterday
[03:18:56] <ruby_on_tails> the data is coming i can see it in firebug
[03:18:58] <jomofcw> I agree with blackspotwiggins.
[03:18:58] <blackspotwiggins> also, if the response is not 200 it wont work
[03:19:00] <ruby_on_tails> but that alert is not working
[03:19:04] <jomofcw> OK thanks Woet ^^
[03:19:09] <ruby_on_tails> blackspotwiggins: i can see the perfect output in firebug
[03:19:21] <blackspotwiggins> or in case of json
[03:19:25] <blackspotwiggins> if its not valid json
[03:19:31] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[03:19:35] <blackspotwiggins> use the data from firebug on jsonlint
[03:19:51] <ruby_on_tails> ok
[03:20:29] <ruby_on_tails> umm.... blackspotwiggins the json got JS code in it so many braces, maybe thats breaking it
[03:20:38] <blackspotwiggins> ruby_on_tails, are you handcrafting json?
[03:20:42] <ruby_on_tails> yes
[03:20:45] <ruby_on_tails> in php
[03:20:45] <blackspotwiggins> you are doing it wrong
[03:20:47] <blackspotwiggins> use a library
[03:20:54] <ruby_on_tails> $output = "{'data': [{'chart':'$chart', 'table':'$table', 'debug':'$debug'}] }";
[03:20:57] <blackspotwiggins> wtf
[03:20:57] <ruby_on_tails> i did this
[03:21:03] <blackspotwiggins> have you ever heard of json_encode ?
[03:21:12] <ruby_on_tails> umm i read this http://jhoyimperial.wordpress.com/2008/07/28/parsing-json-data-from-php-using-jquery/
[03:21:15] <blackspotwiggins> do you also handcraft your http responses?
[03:21:29] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[03:21:30] <ruby_on_tails> nope
[03:21:42] <blackspotwiggins> well why should you do that with json then
[03:21:50] <blackspotwiggins> you are going to fail sooner or later
[03:21:54] <blackspotwiggins> and there's a lib for that
[03:22:57] <ruby_on_tails> ok cool, works cool now
[03:23:22] <ruby_on_tails> i just want to send some data array, so thought will learn json today
[03:24:41] <sint> jomofcw: http://jsfiddle.net/3rt7Q/
[03:26:04] <blackspotwiggins> sint, that code doesnt make sense without context
[03:26:39] <blackspotwiggins> also you should this.href
[03:27:36] <jomofcw> sint if the prob is you've got the DOMAIn in IE, it's normal.
[03:27:41] <jomofcw> That's the way IE do it.
[03:28:54] <sint> blackspotwiggins: hm, i am about to write a plugin for a project and this is the part thats not working. maybe you're right and the problem comes from something else, but what puzzles me is the fact that the value in "url" differs from the one added to the href itself
[03:29:50] <blackspotwiggins> well since the input is different as well, you are not normalizing your data. and by missing context i meant the process for transforming those urls
[03:30:14] <blackspotwiggins> but it's also safe to say that ie7 is weird and stupid
[03:30:50] <sint> jomofcw: no thats not the problem since i replace this value at all. the problem is that "url" value added to href with jquery "attr" differs
[03:31:19] <jomofcw> sint OK, I agree with blackspotwiggins we need to see how you create/modify it.
[03:32:07] <sint> blackspotwiggins, jomofcw: just a sec
[03:35:30] <norbi> hello
[03:35:38] <norbi> how can i make an object from a simple html text
[03:36:17] <blackspotwiggins> var a = { "text" : "<html>" }
[03:36:35] <norbi> like var embed= Â¨<object width=Â´100Â´ height=Â´324Â´></object>Â¨; i want to modify its width
[03:36:47] <norbi> $(embed).width()
[03:37:15] <blackspotwiggins> .attr() is for accessing/changing attributes
[03:37:26] <smartFun> if I use $('#container1').load('index.html irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/#container2'), than I have always two containers in my html document -> irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/#container1Â and inside irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/#container2, how can I load in container1 only the content of irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/#container2Â directly?
[03:37:43] <VictorCl2> can I use a find after a find ?
[03:38:06] <makinen> I've a non-visible div. How can I open up it in colorbox?
[03:39:57] <sint> blackspotwiggins, jomofcw: you guys are right, the problem is from the function computing the link. it computes different results in IE7. i could paste it, but i'll try to fix it myself first.
[03:41:06] <makinen> I know how to pass an url to colorobox but no idea how to view a div if it's on the same page as the trigger which opens up colorbox
[03:41:27] <sint> IE7 is the new IE6 :D
[03:42:05] <blackspotwiggins> ie8 is the new ie6 actually
[03:42:20] <blackspotwiggins> ie7 is marginal
[03:42:35] <sint> ya, but my client wants support for it :-S
[03:42:57] <blackspotwiggins> ie8 will stick around causing headaches for much longer than ie7
[03:43:10] <jomofcw> makinen there's example on inline content in colorbox website
[03:43:12] <jomofcw> rtfm ;)
[03:43:53] <jomofcw> smartFun you should miss paste something ^^
[03:44:55] <makinen> jomofcw: thx. I took a look at there but missed that
[03:45:35] <mayersd> are you able to use jquery ui sortable with the live function ?
[03:49:16] <jomofcw> mayersd who should be able to do that ?
[03:50:13] <johanhar> If I want to make a new empty option tag? Just like $("<option>") ?  After that I can do optionvariable.html("Some html")? Seems as its not working... :S
[03:50:45] <johanhar> Nvm that, first maybe ask if I can append same DOM element to many parents? Or do I have to clone/copy it first then?
[03:51:14] <blackspotwiggins> johanhar, you have to clone if you want multiple elements
[03:51:35] <blackspotwiggins> and its easier to create a brand new one from scratch for your case
[03:51:57] <blackspotwiggins> $("<option>", { html : content, someattribute : 123})
[03:52:36] <jomofcw> +1 again ^^
[03:52:42] <johanhar> blackspotwiggins: thanks :)
[03:54:15] <mayersd> jomofcw: are you sure ? I've tried a couple of times without success
[03:55:43] <jomofcw> mayersd... there should be a comunication prob here, or you've got english prob either ^^
[03:56:15] <jomofcw> mayersd anyway, it should work, but take care to don't call live on an element that will be removed
[04:11:08] <ryrych> ajpiano, gnarf: now I am sure I have done it :D looking forward to share the code with you (even though you probably know it), please poke me, when you are around, ok? :D
[04:14:06] <makinen> how is it possible to call some function when colorbox has been closed?
[04:17:04] <coldhead> makinen: looks like you want to provide an onClosed handler
[04:18:09] <makinen> yes found that
[04:22:10] <coldhead> sooo case cloased?
[04:22:29] <johanhar> In PHP, the method/function isset, any smiliar in jQuery?
[04:22:54] <johanhar> similar*
[04:23:00] <coldhead> ?eval typeof somethingNotSet
[04:23:17] <coldhead> oh, no bot
[04:23:42] <ranza> do any of you know a good iphone/ipad swipe plugin?
[04:24:06] <coldhead> johanhar: if (typeof neverSet === 'undefined') { etc }
[04:24:22] <coldhead> if (typeof neverSet !== 'undefined') { etc }
[04:24:32] <johanhar> thanks :)
[04:25:10] <BG_> I have an image, I change its src property, how can I fire an event when the NEW image is completely loaded? $(img).load() always fires right away...
[04:25:32] <BG_> also img.complete is always true
[04:25:34] <BG_> ideas?
[04:25:51] <ryrych> BG_: add a random parameter to the src
[04:26:03] <ryrych> BG_: itâ€™s a bug in IEs
[04:26:04] <BG_> how would that help?
[04:26:32] <BG_> and I'm testing on FF4...
[04:26:47] <ryrych> BG_ hold on a sec, I will give you a link to an article about this
[04:26:53] <BG_> ok
[04:27:09] <coldhead> i would just use another <img> instead of just changing the sauce
[04:27:28] <BG_> hmm, that's doable coldhead
[04:28:07] <stenno> good day, i am using $.getJSON to load a local(!) json file, but i get a same-domain policy error returned, and now i am wondering why? the url is like 'file:///path/to/my/file.json'
[04:28:23] <stenno> shouldn't it be the same domain/
[04:28:26] <stenno> ?
[04:28:45] <ryrych> BG_: http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/fixing-load-in-ie-for-cached-images/
[04:29:13] <ravenzz> $('img.foo').attr('src', 'imageURL.jpg').load(function() { /* ... */ });
[04:29:16] <ravenzz> :?
[04:29:44] <iksik> hello
[04:29:45] <coldhead> stenno: lots of things don't work with file:///
[04:29:46] <ryrych> BG_ maybe I misunderstood you, but this is also good hint
[04:29:49] <coldhead> it's not like other domains
[04:29:59] <coldhead> i'm sorry :(
[04:30:05] <stenno> coldhead, i see, thanks! i have to find another way then :)
[04:30:08] <iksik> how can i bind to form ( with submit event ) on content loaded via ajax call?
[04:30:26] <BG_> ok thanks guys
[04:30:51] <coldhead> iksik: $('form').live('submit, function () {...
[04:31:01] <iksik> coldhead, doesn't seems to work
[04:31:09] <coldhead> ('form').live('submit', function () {...
[04:31:33] <coldhead> what version of jQuery are you on?
[04:31:37] <coldhead> it should work
[04:31:44] <iksik> coldhead, https://gist.github.com/6e5171df6e0962738088
[04:32:00] <iksik> and when i hit 'submit' button it submits form in traditional way
[04:32:06] <coldhead> if it doesn't you can bind the submit handler at the time you add the form
[04:32:23] <iksik> coldhead, can You look at my code?
[04:32:25] <seutje> does thou return false?
[04:32:37] <seutje> oh thou does
[04:32:38] <JKarsrud> no U return false
[04:32:47] <seutje> but thou only binds the live on the ajax response
[04:32:52] <seutje> so why use live then? o.O
[04:32:54] <iksik> yes, to prevent submit action
[04:32:59] <ravenzz> ?preventdefault @ iksik
[04:33:11] <iksik> seutje, don't know ? ;-)
[04:33:36] <ravenzz> iksik http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[04:34:28] <iksik> ravenzz, thx, testing
[04:35:20] <coldhead> iksik: the point of live() is you don't have to bind it inside the ajax callback, you can do it anywhere and it will work when it needs to in the future
[04:35:34] <coldhead> inside the callback you may as well use .bind()
[04:35:49] <iksik> ok
[04:35:58] <iksik> ravenzz, it works...
[04:36:01] <coldhead> although this should still work, in my mind
[04:36:02] <iksik> thanks again ;)
[04:38:08] <iksik> ok, one more question... is it possible to use combination of append and fadein?
[04:39:25] <seutje> like $('<div>foo</div>').hide().appendTo('body').fadeIn(); ?

[04:48:21] <kostodo> ive using .cycle and the colorbox plugin on the same page a lightbox. cycle works, but if I click on any of the colorbox items after i go back to the page the cycle next/prev handles no longer fire
[04:48:35] <kostodo> any ideas how i could debug this and see where the conflict is?
[04:48:42] <kostodo> maybe theres something I need to put in the callback?
[04:58:24] <makinen> how can I bind a function to the event when a li element has been appended to a list?
[04:58:36] <seutje> kostodo: so after opening/closing a colorbox, the cycle navigation stops working?
[04:59:01] <kostodo> seutje: yeah precisely
[04:59:15] <seutje> kostodo: check if the elements still have event handlers bound to it
[04:59:17] <kostodo> seutje: but the cycle navigation of another element
[04:59:29] <kostodo> not the same one thats doing the colorbox
[04:59:53] <kostodo> just happens to be another slideshow on the same page thats using cycle (independent of the colorbox)
[04:59:58] <kostodo> let me check
[05:00:05] <seutje> erm
[05:00:15] <seutje> does ur cycle navigation use IDs?
[05:00:18] <VictorCl2> why fadeIn will put display: table-row-group; on my selector :/  ...
[05:00:21] <VictorCl2> how can I avoid this
[05:00:39] <seutje> VictorCl2: make ur own stepper
[05:02:31] <ToreadorVampire> Hrm - does jQuery come with a list/collection of the non-displaying keycodes for keypresses/key up/down events etc?  I'm working on a maximum-character limit control and I want to suppress keypresses once the user has gone over the char limit (and display feedback) but I don't want to be quite so obnoxious that I deny the ability to use the arrow/backspace/delete keys …
[05:03:22] <ToreadorVampire> … I was wondering if there is already some kind of .isACharacter(someKeycode) method lurking in jQuery somewhere before I go and research a list of the keycodes that I want to explicitly permit
[05:03:46] <VictorCl2> how do I make the fadeIn with animate ?
[05:03:50] <seutje> doubt it
[05:04:08] <seutje> ?source fadein
[05:04:09] <bot-t> Line#7679 - "fadeIn: { opacity: "show" }," - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#7679
[05:06:17] <seutje> ToreadorVampire: http://www.cambiaresearch.com/c4/702b8cd1-e5b0-42e6-83ac-25f0306e3e25/javascript-char-codes-key-codes.aspx
[05:07:16] <VictorCl2> fuck it does the same thing
[05:07:43] <VictorCl2> animate({opacity: 'show'},500...  when is finish it will add display: table-row-group;
[05:08:19] <ToreadorVampire> seutje: Yeah - I'm aware of that list thanks; indeed I need a larger list since I also want to permit arrow keys + the shift/ctrl modifiers and the like; but I was really just checking that if I build a function to check for "is it an allowed keypress" (IE:  it doesn't result in a character being written to the output) that I'm not duplicating some already built-in functionality
[05:08:34] <ToreadorVampire> Seems not, so I'll head over to MDC and get the full list of keycodes and build that function quickly
[05:09:27] <seutje> ToreadorVampire: arrows are in that table o.O
[05:10:29] <ToreadorVampire> seutje: Right, but isn't there a unique keycode for [Ctrl + left arrow] that is different from [left arrow]?
[05:10:40] <seutje> shift/ctrl don't change anything to the charcode of arrow keys
[05:10:51] <seutje> there's even a lil input box for u to try
[05:11:01] <seutje> press shift+right arrow in it, it'll still tell u it's 39
[05:11:18] <ToreadorVampire> So it does
[05:11:28] <ToreadorVampire> Well, thanks - that saved me some wasted time :)
[05:15:38] <fra79Wii> Hi guys, I've spend hours yesterday night to understand how can I .get() and use an xml file from an external site, I came to the conclusion that's impossible, I have to download it in server side and then I can serve it to my application with an ajax call... Really? there is no way to pass the cross-site problem in javascript?
[05:15:51] <seutje> ToreadorVampire: if u want to specifically test for modifier keys, check for e.shiftKey e.altKey e.ctrlKey or e.metaKey
[05:16:33] <Peeter> fra79Wii: You can use a flash bridge to request data from another site.
[05:16:43] <Peeter> But that's only if the other site allows it.
[05:17:00] <Peeter> If that doesn't fit you, embed a java applet in the site.
[05:17:05] <makinen> $("#foo :ul").append(li_item) <- is it possible to catch the append event after this?
[05:17:12] <ToreadorVampire> seutje: Nah - that's fine thx - there are no circumstances in which the modifier keys result in any printable characters being written to the control
[05:17:37] <ToreadorVampire> Argh, I do need to keep an eye on the right-click-paste (and other clipboard operations) scenario though
[05:18:52] <fra79Wii> Peter: I download it in memory with python (or php) and redirect the text/xml object and it's ok... but I was counting to not stress my server on downloading data, relying the task all to the client.. my bad :(
[05:19:15] <seutje> ToreadorVampire: also note that some sticky accent chars can give weird reactions
[05:19:32] <ToreadorVampire> I think I might .change(function() { if($(this).val().length > characterLimit { $(this).val($(this.val().substring(0, characterLimit))) }}); though … (or whatever the .js for substringing is, need to look it up, too much backend work = "I'm rusty on the .js API"
[05:21:26] <kostodo> seutje: yes my .cycle nav is using #id's
[05:21:45] <seutje> kostodo: any chance there's multiple elements with the same ID?
[05:22:00] <kostodo> seutje: nope
[05:22:32] <seutje> ToreadorVampire: for instance, if I wanna type a tilde on an azerty keyboard, I have to press 3 keys, alt+= and space, only the space will be caught by keypress
[05:22:46] <kostodo> seutje: any other ideas?
[05:22:47] <seutje> kostodo: hmz, odd
[05:22:50] <seutje> not rly
[05:22:54] <kostodo> seutje: yeah i know!
[05:23:48] <ToreadorVampire> seutje: Right, I'm building this list using a whitelist of "permitted keys" rather than a blacklist of banned ones.  The spacebar won't be permitted since it results in a character being typed in just about every scenario I can think of
[05:23:58] <kostodo> seutje: the only other thing I can tell you is that colorbox is a module in D7 and the .cycle plugin im loading myself with my own code through my theme
[05:24:11] <kostodo> seutje: unless im running my .cycle code wrapped wrongly for D7
[05:24:15] <ToreadorVampire> I'm really just wanting to permit things like using the arrow keys for navigation/selection whilst preventing further text being entered past the character limit
[05:24:52] <Puck`> hi everyone
[05:26:14] <Puck`> I'm bumping in to a problem I can't seem to solve. I'm trying to create a bar which drops down on click and "goes away" on mouseout. My problem is that the mouseout event happens too early, it seems as the div is not in it's place. The test can be seen here: http://soulfishhouseradio.com/ - Click on the top bar to see the expanded part appear.
[05:26:31] <Puck`> if you guys can guide me to any docs/blogs that explain this, that would be a lot of help too
[05:29:00] <beilabs> Hey guys, i just inserted a appended a few li elements into a ul.  I'm trying to make them dragable but they don't seem to work when they are appended using an ajax query.  The elements drag fine for elements classed as draggable but not for the ajax inserted ones. Any advice?
[05:29:57] <ToreadorVampire> beilabs: What code is making them draggable at all in the first place?  is that code executing retroactively for the new elements being added dynamically?
[05:30:47] <beilabs> ToreadorVampire: I declare  $(".drag").draggable(); on a function thats on page load I guess...
[05:31:00] <beilabs> no, its not being executed retroactively
[05:31:05] <ToreadorVampire> Perhaps you did something like $("#someContainer li").makeDraggable(); at some point in the page's lifecycle.  That would only make existing li elements draggable - you need to call that again on the newly-added elements
[05:31:32] <ToreadorVampire> Right, so when you call that .draggable() method, the elements that you have added after the page loaded didn't exist, so they were never made draggable ;)
[05:31:57] <ToreadorVampire> As part of whatever method adds them to the page, try something like $(theNewLiElement).draggable();
[05:33:03] <beilabs> ToreadorVampire: Doh, legend..working now.
[05:33:03] <beilabs> :D
[05:33:27] <ToreadorVampire> np
[05:34:24] <ravenzz> ..
[05:34:40] <seutje> hehe, I just typed "blackground: back;" :')
[05:34:44] <ravenzz> anyone is using the google's publick dns?
[05:34:47] <ravenzz> -k

[05:35:27] <phrearch> does jquery ui tabs allow following anchor urls?

[05:36:25] <ToreadorVampire> ravenzz: ^^ Seems that way (lines 3 and onwards of the result are omitted for brevity)
[05:37:11] <ravenzz> yes, now it is working again
[05:37:13] <ravenzz> thank you
[05:45:52] <kostodo> seutje: u there?
[05:49:14] <stenno> is there a shorter version for $.ajax({ async:false, ...}); ?
[05:49:46] <stenno> (concerning a GET request)
[05:50:57] <erichynds> you prolly shouldn't be using sync requests stenno
[05:51:13] <stenno> if i understand the documentation correctly, even $.get() implies async:true
[05:51:21] <erichynds> correct
[05:51:39] <erichynds> you should only ever use async:false if the ajax requests needs to fire inside a window unload handler
[05:51:51] <stenno> i see
[05:52:08] <stenno> that is not the case
[05:52:22] <erichynds> o rly
[05:52:41] <stenno> i just want every code to be executed after the request succeded
[05:52:51] <erichynds> use callbacks or deferreds
[05:52:57] <stenno> and i don't want to write the whole code in the success: callback
[05:53:05] <erichynds> :(
[05:53:12] <stenno> deffereds?
[05:53:18] <stenno> deferreds :)
[05:53:25] <erichynds> ?sync
[05:53:25] <bot-t> NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the userâ€™s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[05:53:29] <stenno> :O
[05:53:40] <stenno> alright
[05:53:52] <stenno> erichynds, thanks!
[05:53:59] <erichynds> do it like this: function done(){};  $.get(url, done);
[05:54:01] <Murugaratham> any1 know wat's the best way to get 3rd level parent id?
[05:54:05] <erichynds> then you don't have to nest callbacks
[05:54:08] <stenno> good idea
[05:54:10] <stenno> thanks agains
[05:54:12] <stenno> again
[05:54:14] <erichynds> <3
[05:54:17] <stenno> :)
[05:54:20] <Murugaratham> $(this).parent().parent().parent().attr("id")?
[05:54:25] <Murugaratham> are there better ways
[05:54:28] <erichynds> ?closest @ Murugaratham
[05:54:29] <bot-t> Murugaratham, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/

[05:57:07] <johanhar> making fun of the bot :D
[05:57:14] <johanhar> ....false.... :D

[05:58:11] <seutje> less funny now?
[05:58:26] <seutje> bot-t: should johanhar be making fun of you?
[05:58:27] <bot-t> seutje, Signs point to yes.
[05:58:30] <kostodo> seutje: fyintyc (i just made that up stands for "for your information not that you care") i fixed my issue! :)
[05:58:30] <seutje> okaaaay
[05:58:38] <makinen> how can I loop each span and input element inside an li element?
[05:58:51] <seutje> oh, cool... and yea, I don't rly care :D
[05:58:54] <makinen> $('#to-print :ul :li').each(function() {
[05:59:00] <kostodo> sweet!
[05:59:04] <seutje> :ul? o.O
[05:59:06] <blackspotwiggins> wtf kind of selector is :ul
[05:59:12] <seutje> pseudo lists? o.O
[05:59:19] <blackspotwiggins> unordered ones!
[05:59:27] <seutje> or would that be ::ul? :P
[05:59:31] <makinen> that's what I do for li elements but I don't know how to fetch the span and input elements inside the li
[05:59:42] <seutje> does that work for LIs?
[05:59:52] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, it's ::-webkit-ul for now ;)
[05:59:59] <seutje> $('<ul><li><li><ul>').find(':ul').length
[06:00:02] <seutje> $('<ul><li><li><ul>').find(':ul').length?eval

[06:00:15] <seutje> damned home button is broken :(
[06:01:27] <phishy> if i have multiple forms on one page, and I only want the fields of one of the them to post based on the value of a dropdown, what's the best way to hide the other forms, add attr disabled?
[06:04:16] <makinen> <ul><li><span class="foo">asd</span><input type="checkbox"/></li> <li><span class="foo">asd2</span><input type="checkbox"/></li> </ul>
[06:04:19] <blackspotwiggins> generally form submits the inputs that are descendants of said form
[06:06:24] <phishy> blackspotwiggins: ah yes indeed, i'm an idiot
[06:07:32] <phishy> it's really only a portion of the form that needs to change based on select, so i was trying to hide the other portions, but some have overlapping fieldnames
[06:09:42] <blackspotwiggins> phishy, if you dont use arrays, then the last input with the same name should get used
[06:09:52] <phishy> blackspotwiggins: ya, thats the problem
[06:09:59] <blackspotwiggins> but it's safer to disable the fields that you dont need

[06:12:50] <Renkineko> hi everybody :)
[06:14:58] <Renkineko> i need your assistance. I'm trying to setup a drag and drop on my website. There is a treeview on the left side, and documents on the right side, on two distinct div... I try to drag a document on the treeview, and it's not okay, what's the option I must modify ?
[06:15:40] <Renkineko> I tried the axis, with the jquery node which has the two div (treeview and docs list) as child, but it's not good either :/
[06:20:10] <diegocn> Hello ppl.... I'm using jquery-ui > buttonset to 'transform' a set of radio buttons.... how can I get the 'value' of checked button?
[06:21:38] <PacketMonkey> How can I stop jQuery.ajax from modifying the url? I am trying to make a jsonp request and jquery keeps adding a ?_=1308230378914 parameter to the URL.
[06:22:12] <Cork> PacketMonkey: the ?_ is to evade the browsers cache
[06:22:30] <Woet> PacketMonkey: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[06:22:31] <Cork> change the cache value to allow cache and it will be removed
[06:22:35] <Woet> If set to false, it will force requested pages not to be cached by the browser.
[06:23:45] <PacketMonkey> Thanks for the pointers, I will look into that.
[06:23:53] <Cork> PacketMonkey: warning though, if you remove that value, browsers arn't garanteed to send the request if it happend before
[06:24:10] <Cork> same url will be loaded from the browsers cache instead
[06:24:54] <PacketMonkey> That should be fine, this data isn't expected to change very often.
[06:27:25] <innociv> The hell.  Minifying my code makes it fail
[06:28:38] <Murugaratham> when i add a callback to a click event
[06:28:49] <Murugaratham> why can't i print $(this).text()?
[06:31:16] <Jon47> murugaratham.. who knows, show us the code and we can troubleshoot it
[06:31:44] <BlaDe^> I have a selector which is like $('.class') -- that can be an anchor, or an input
[06:32:00] <BlaDe^> so I need to use .html() or .val() respectiely... can I do that or do I need to make my selectors for each?
[06:32:07] <Murugaratham> im doing :
[06:32:32] <skylamer`> ure using for what BlaDe^ ?
[06:32:52] <BlaDe^> skylamer` does it make a difference? I'm using it for zero clipboard to copy text from inputs or anchors

[06:34:36] <skylamer`> with .val get the text and then to the clipboard
[06:34:48] <BlaDe^> skylamer` I know that
[06:34:49] <skylamer`> just u can use more specific selector than just class or   : )
[06:34:59] <BlaDe^> so the answer is that I can't do what I want, right?

[06:36:36] <ustim> hi all. Q: how I can bind 'expand' event for accordion?
[06:36:37] <BlaDe^> lol
[06:36:40] <sear|work> I'm having a very interesting issue with a change event handler.  Each time I change the select box, the event handler is invoked 2^x times.  e.g. the first time I change it, it executes once.  The second time, twice.  The third, four times.  The fourth, eight times, and so-on.  Any idea what might be happening here?
[06:36:43] <BlaDe^> don't worry, skylamer` i'll just use two selectors :)
[06:37:28] <markj> sear|work i'd imagine you're binding the event multiple times
[06:37:45] <sear|work> Oh, that makes sense!  Let me check to make sure I haven't done that.
[06:37:58] <sear|work> Thanks markj.
[06:38:58] <axtv> hi everyone. anyone have any suggestions on the some good js/jquery books available on amazon?
[06:39:45] <sear|work> markj: That did it!  Thanks so much!
[06:40:09] <markj> not a problem
[06:43:52] <Juzzy>  17:56:00 up 243 days,  1:27,  1 user,  load average: 8.04, 7.92, 6.36
[06:43:56] <Juzzy> erm
[06:47:27] <BlaDe^> what does .data("oval") do ?
[06:47:52] <juha___> ?data @ BlaDe^
[06:47:52] <bot-t1> BlaDe^, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[06:50:16] <BlaDe^> aha thanks
[06:50:21] <BlaDe^> juha___ do you know about my previous question?
[06:50:38] <BlaDe^> I have like a $('.class') which will pickup anchors, and inputs --- I need to use .html() and .val() respectively to grab the data
[06:50:47] <BlaDe^> do I need 2 selectors or is there a nice way to do it?
[06:53:48] <phrearch> hey
[06:54:09] <phrearch> i would like to have jquery ui tabs follow the anchor in the navigation bar. i can do this manually like http://paste.pocoo.org/show/408821/
[06:54:22] <phrearch> is it possible to have this as default behaviour?
[06:55:52] <djQuery> phrearch: not realy. gues you could modify the tabs function to set the tab show function to do this
[06:56:29] <phrearch> djQuery: override the show function?
[06:56:55] <cfk_> if i know some html data is added to a document using appentTo, what event can i use to detect that change?
[06:59:56] <ryanneufeld> BlaDe^: you're gonna need $('input.class').val() and $('anchor.class').html()
[07:01:19] <cesconix> can i detect ie7 browser?
[07:01:45] <ryanneufeld> cfk_: there is a native event you can bind to
[07:02:27] <djQuery> phrearch: yeah something like this http://jsfiddle.net/CEKXW/
[07:02:47] <djQuery> phrearch: although this example does self inheritance so it needs 1.9 to work
[07:03:12] <phrearch> djQuery: excellent! thanks
[07:03:21] <phrearch> ill get 1.9 to make it work
[07:03:34] <Trisox> exelentehhh
[07:03:36] <phrearch> i only need to pass in hash:true as option i suppose?
[07:03:39] <djQuery> phrearch: by the way 1.9 is still in beta
[07:03:52] <phrearch> djQuery: ow, thats ok i suppose
[07:04:00] <djQuery> phrearch: http://davidjquery.com/?p=9
[07:04:15] <djQuery> read up on that and you will probably get it to work in 1.8
[07:04:19] <cfk_> ryanneufeld: awesome, which one is it?
[07:04:34] <gcthompson> hi there, can anybody help me with jquery templates?
[07:05:10] <phrearch> djQuery: ok thanks. should i get 1.9 from github otherwise?
[07:05:19] <cfk_> actually i guess it's appendTo but i'm not sure, is there a better way to detect changes to an element with a specific id?
[07:05:57] <cfk_> jQuery('#some-id').change() detects user-generated changes i guess
[07:06:33] <ryanneufeld> cfk_: I'm trying to find what it's called
[07:07:30] <ryanneufeld> cfk_: $(document).bind('DOMNodeInserted DOMNodeRemoved', function(event) {
[07:07:35] <cfk_> thanks!
[07:07:53] <ryanneufeld> I'm not sure if that's cross browser though
[07:08:08] <ryanneufeld> .change is also for selects I think
[07:08:19] <cfk_> i can replace document with an id as well?
[07:08:26] <ryanneufeld> no
[07:09:26] <ryanneufeld> http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-type-DOMNodeInserted
[07:09:33] <ryanneufeld> I may be mistaken
[07:09:37] <ryanneufeld> we only used it for a little while
[07:10:12] <gcthompson> how would you escape a member value which contains a :
[07:10:14] <markj> you'd be better off using the event that injects the content rather than detecting the dom changing
[07:10:16] <gcthompson> it seems to confuse jquery
[07:10:36] <phrearch> how long does it take to build jquery-ui with ant by the way?
[07:10:41] <phrearch> ah 2 minutes haha
[07:10:42] <cfk_> i think that's it
[07:11:11] <ryanneufeld> markj: is right
[07:11:29] <ryanneufeld> cfk_: you might also want to look into pub/sub
[07:11:46] <ryanneufeld> or namespacing your events
[07:11:56] <Trisox> hey ryanneufeld ;)
[07:12:01] <ryanneufeld> hey
[07:12:15] <Trisox> :D
[07:12:28] <Trisox> thnx for your solution last night btw
[07:12:36] <ryanneufeld> np
[07:12:53] <Kaapa> any easy way to detect if a browser supports css transitions?
[07:13:07] <ryanneufeld> Kaapa: yup, very easy
[07:13:23] <ryanneufeld> Kaapa: http://www.modernizr.com/
[07:13:26] <Kaapa> I'm looking at the $.support, but nothing seems obvious
[07:13:34] <Kaapa> ah, nothing builtin then
[07:13:48] <ryanneufeld> don't think so
[07:14:09] <ryanneufeld> support is more for animations and things like that
[07:14:14] <ryanneufeld> modernizr is pretty handy
[07:14:27] <markj> modernizr 2 lets you do a custom build for testing certain features, so you can make it tiny
[07:14:30] <ryanneufeld> just loading it helps, you can check the html element for the right class
[07:14:38] <markj> or, look at the modernizr source, check how they're testing it and use it in your code
[07:14:42] <markj> because it'll be raw js
[07:14:48] <ryanneufeld> and what markj said
[07:15:08] <Kaapa> it looks the kind of stuff I want to have anyway
[07:15:19] <Kaapa> I'll check the logs to see what it does, seems to be more than just feature detection
[07:18:09] <Null_> having trouble trying to get multiple jquery cycle slideshows on same page, with their own prev/next buttons.  Still investigating some examples online, but any ideas?  http://therightrealtor.ca/testing/cycle/
[07:25:41] <sproaty> hi, when dealing with JSONP requests, are we meant to do success/error handling inside a single function? Because I'm returning text/javascript from the external site, I can't use errors codes to indicate a status
[07:26:01] <sproaty> if i return a 400 error then the javascript won't get laoded
[07:27:03] <Solidem> Hi ppl! Can you use multiple selectors with variables?
[07:27:20] <Solidem> var elem1 = $("#elem1"), elem2 = $("#elem2");
[07:27:22] <Peeter> sproaty: You could use exception
[07:27:30] <Solidem> $(elem1, elem2).click(function ....
[07:27:41] <Solidem> but what I just wrote obvisously doesn't work :)
[07:27:59] <Peeter> Solidem: Are you trying to add the same click even to multiple selectors?
[07:27:59] <sproaty> Peeter,  how do you mean?
[07:28:13] <Peeter> Javascript has Exceptions
[07:28:28] <Solidem> I'm actually trying to add a keypress-listener to them both
[07:28:48] <sproaty> if I have to return some form of JSON from my external controller, then I can't use jquery's .error() deferred on the ajax call because I always have to return a 200 status
[07:28:51] <Solidem> should I use "add" ?
[07:29:40] <Cryp71c> When I change an element's onclick using $('#selector').click(function() { some stuff }); Does that set the element's onclick to whatever I put or does it just append my stuff to the end of the already-existing on-click?
[07:29:45] <Peeter> I misunderstood you, I thought you were returning text/javascript not JSON.
[07:30:16] <sproaty> erm whoops. yeah sorry....I am returning javascript, that's executing a callback functin passed to the external site
[07:30:34] <Solidem> instead of $($elem1, $elem2).click(function...)    I found out you can do    $($elem1).add($elem2).click(function ....)   which works fine for me
[07:30:42] <sproaty> but then I can't use the ajax.success().error() stuffs
[07:30:47] <Peeter> If you're returning JSON, indicate the error like this: { error:"Error 404 has happened" } and once you load the results, check if the error element is present and do your magic.
[07:30:49] <Solidem> $($elem1, $elem2) would have been neater
[07:31:10] <sproaty> Peeter, ah, thought I'd have to do it like that. shame.
[07:31:14] <red> What's the smartest way to achieve tabs with jQuery so that clicking the first tab would show site.com/tab1 in the nav bar
[07:31:30] <red> and browsing into site.com/tab3 opens the web site with the 3rd tab open
[07:31:32] <Peeter> Solidem: I'd suggest using event delegation
[07:31:56] <red> I'm guessing rewriterules are needed
[07:32:23] <Peeter> Do both of your elements have the same parent element? For example, are they both text areas inside the same div or form?
[07:32:29] <Renkineko> OK I understood my problem. The drag and drop don't work if the div is within another div which have the overflow on auto... And it's kinda logical after reflexion :) the option "helper" set on "clone" resolve the problem. Bye :)
[07:33:40] <Solidem> Peeter, yeah they are 2 input fields that I want to bind keypress-listener to
[07:33:53] <Solidem> catch the return key being pressed and process using ajax
[07:34:20] <Peeter> Then look into the delegate method
[07:34:29] <Peeter> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:35:09] <Solidem> ok tnx
[07:49:23] <djQuery>  phrearch: yes but notice how in my example i added a option so that you can still have the default functionality if neccessary.

[07:51:01] <TheVenerableZ> Is it possible to remove a pseudoclass in jquery?
[07:51:07] <phrearch> both had the same issue
[07:51:12] <TheVenerableZ> something like $(this).removeClass(":hover");
[07:52:03] <MaxMeents> is #allObjs > .Obj > .objImg faster than just calling .objImg?
[07:52:08] <djQuery> phrearch: can you put together a fiddle of the dialog issue? believe the fiddle that I linked to earlier had everything u would need
[07:52:33] <MaxMeents> sorry, is #id > .class1 > .class2 faster than just .class2?
[07:53:16] <BG_> quick question, if somebody knows: how to tell jcarousel to recalculate its elements' widths? (for example, to hide the "next" arrow if items currently fit, whereas they didn't when jcarousel was created)
[07:53:17] <bot-t1> MaxMeents, jQuery.noop(): An empty function. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noop/
[07:53:29] <djQuery> MaxMeents: depends on how many opbjects are in the domn
[07:54:12] <MaxMeents> dj, so if there are a lot then I assume yes?
[07:54:23] <djQuery> MaxMeents: yes
[07:54:29] <MaxMeents> thank you sir

[07:55:48] <Solidem> red, the part after "#" is not sent to server, true.
[07:57:03] <BG_> anyone please? how to tell jcarousel to recalculate its elements' widths? (for example, to hide the "next" arrow if items currently fit, whereas they didn't when jcarousel was created)
[07:57:24] <red> solidem: can I somehow create a rewrite rule or such so that browsing site.com/page would actually serve #page ?
[07:57:27] <phrearch> djQuery: cant reproduce it without 1.9 on jsfiddle i think
[07:57:44] <vazel> Not sure- dealing with carousel issues myself :)

[08:01:40] <aminpy> how can I resolve this problem?
[08:01:54] <Solidem> red, I'm not really up to speed with mod_rewrite but surely you can make it rewrite domain.com/foo/bar/   into domain.com/foo/#bar
[08:01:56] <djQuery> aminpy: by giving the post a good url?

[08:08:24] <djQuery> Boudga: $('form').submit(function(e){ var f = $('#fieldid'); f.val(f.val() + "'"; }
[08:09:00] <djQuery> cesconix: $.browser but I believe that it is being dropped in favor of feature detection.
[08:09:24] <cesconix> djinni, $.support?
[08:09:28] <cesconix> ops
[08:09:31] <cesconix> djQuery,
[08:09:34] <Boudga> djQuery, that is very close to what i tried... thanks I'll try that instead
[08:10:21] <djQuery> cesconix: boudga: yes $.support would be better.
[08:10:36] <krz> anyone here use uploadify?

[08:11:31] <krz> im using uploadify with an image button. everything works. except i need to have a cursor instead of a pointer on mouse hover
[08:11:55] <ryanneufeld> krz you want the css cursor property
[08:12:02] <djQuery> krz: then jsut set some css to give the button the right cursor
[08:12:04] <krz> on the object element ryanneufeld ?
[08:12:06] <ryanneufeld> djQuery: I know
[08:12:16] <ryanneufeld> krz: no, in your CSS
[08:12:40] <ElGoorf> having some slight difficulty, i have a form called by jquery, and i want to preventDefault() but it isnt happening: http://pastebin.com/eWds8NN5
[08:12:45] <krz> yea which element do i style ryanneufeld ?
[08:13:02] <djQuery> ryanneufeld: you any good with pidgeon? maybe we could right a text replace ment plugin that inspected the bot-t web site
[08:13:17] <djQuery> basicaly bypass bot-t
[08:13:19] <krz> <object width="71" height="33" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="/flash/uploadify/uploadify.swf" id="file_uploadUploader" style="visibility: visible;">....</object>
[08:13:28] <ryanneufeld> jdparker: I use adium, and limechat
[08:13:50] <krz> i tried placing cursor:crosshair; on the object element to no avail
[08:13:54] <ryanneufeld> krz: you said you used an image
[08:14:31] <krz> yes but i think uploadify uses flash
[08:14:33] <djQuery> set it using #file_uploadUploader { cursor: crosshair; }
[08:14:34] <krz> a flash object
[08:14:50] <krz> #file_uploadUploader {cursor:crosshair;} still doesnt work
[08:15:13] <krz> cursor is still a pointer
[08:15:39] <krz> firebug reports irc://irc.freenode.net/#file_uploadUploader {cursor:crosshair;}
[08:15:41] <krz> err
[08:15:54] <krz> firebug reports: #file_uploadUploader {cursor:crosshair;} though
[08:16:03] <djQuery> krz: mostlikely inside the flash object they are setting the cursor
[08:16:44] <sproaty> wow I can't believe IE9's developer tools don't show live updates to the DOM
[08:16:50] <sproaty> shocking
[08:17:29] <systemfault> Really?
[08:17:42] <systemfault> It's not shocking when it's EXPECTED.
[08:18:35] <systemfault> I hope they'll do better for IE10 if Javascript/HTML5 is really going to have an important place in Windows 8
[08:18:47] <djQuery> sproaty: think you can right click and view generated source
[08:19:14] <sproaty> a-ha. yeah you have to manually hit this refresh icon
[08:19:25] <sproaty> cool :)
[08:19:37] <agronholm> has anyone else noticed that jquery ui datepicker's setDate method fails on IE 6-8?
[08:19:55] <agronholm> works on IE9
[08:21:11] <ryanneufeld> krz: you said you were using an image
[08:21:46] <ryanneufeld> krz: if you're not, and you're using the swf, then the cursor needs to be changed in the swf code, which you can get from uploadify
[08:21:46] <agronholm> if I use setDate with a Date object, it sets NaN.NaN.NaN as the date string
[08:21:51] <lugzer> agronholm, hey maybe you can tell me why my range datepicker won't work in Safari and only Firefox? http://bzikofski.civ.pl/dp/
[08:22:07] <jayflux_> How can you use the data(); method in a selector
[08:22:09] <agronholm> won't work how
[08:22:16] <jayflux_> select element with the data attribute set to test for example
[08:22:47] <lugzer> agronholm, in firefox you can select date range. first click selects first date, second click another date, and range gets highlighted.
[08:22:55] <lugzer> in Safari the classes don't even get added
[08:23:07] <yunosh> i'm getting a "cannot call methods on listview prior to initialization" in jquery mobile. but how do i know if the listview has been initialized, or how can i attach a callback if that happened?
[08:23:15] <agronholm> lugzer: sorry, I don't have the time to go in-depth debugging someone else's app right now
[08:23:26] <lugzer> ok ;)
[08:23:33] <lugzer> i thought you just know the issue with Safari
[08:23:35] <ElGoorf> sproaty, i literally just discovered this too
[08:23:46] <agronholm> lugzer: happens with chrome/chromium too?
[08:24:14] <vazel> anyone willing to help us debug this for $? (is this against rules to offer this?) semi-urgent
[08:24:14] <gar_onn> agronholm,  works fine here..
[08:24:36] <lugzer> agronholm, chrome is ok. only safari fails
[08:24:42] <gar_onn> weird

[08:40:57] <Boudga> djQuery, I tried the snippet you gave me (which I had to edit slightly) and it still doesn't add the single quote to the posted input value
[08:41:33] <SPow> Hi why doesn't this work when resultObject is an array rather than a single row please : var resultObject = eval(resultData)[0];  alert('nom: ' + resultObject.nom + ' - valeur: ' + resultObject.valeur);
[08:41:34] <Boudga> djQuery, for all intense and purposes it looks like it should work perfectly
[08:43:47] <Fratyr> Hi guys. I need urgent help. Somewhy my .show() function is not working anymore .. the element is not displayed after all, but the rest of the function works properly. this is my code: http://pastebin.com/rYteEMR5 im trying to display+animate some tooltip and show it in particular position on the page.. what can that be!?
[08:44:47] <bla> Maybe it's located inside a hidden element?

[08:52:41] <ch3mi0n> Morning
[08:53:01] <djQuery> cfk_: well you could check to see if it has an id then the xpath would be easy if not loop through each of its parents building up the xpath till you get to an element that has an id or get to the top of the dom
[08:53:59] <djQuery> cfk_: gl
[08:55:11] <philosophically> anyone know of a good drag and drop plugin that is compatible with the ipad?
[08:55:12] <bot-t1> (976 hours ago) <coldhead> tell philosophically you suck
[08:55:50] <Vaerros> philosophically: there's a patched jqueryui that works on iOs
[08:56:06] <Vaerros> the drag and drap(specifically draggable and droppable), at least
[08:56:16] <philosophically> Vaerros:  really? best news i've heard all day
[08:57:15] <philosophically> Vaerros: thank you, i think i found it here http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-for-ipad-and-iphone/issues/attachmentText?id=3&aid=-1363404562444181332&name=ui.ipad.js.patch&token=ce70d9d7ee8a3683c1b8a23574e89d41

[08:59:31] <Vaerros> *somewhere* around there, so to speak

[09:13:13] <necromancer> hey guys, i'm having an issue with validating uniqueness of a form field. here's my JS: https://gist.github.com/1029600
[09:14:00] <necromancer> when a form is submitted, it runs $(this).al_validate(), which runs isUnique(), the function that makes the ajax call to check for uniqueness
[09:14:32] <Fratyr> bla: no, its not located inside a hidden element. its inside a page block with only styles: float: left, margins, position: relative and width. FireBug shows this parent element as visible... still cant get It to be shown. the problem is that show() function must put style="display:block;" to the element, but It's not doing It. but the latter animate function puts left and top without a problem. :(
[09:14:33] <necromancer> isUnique returns a result after the form validates, so the boolean that's telling the form to submit isn't getting set to `false` in time

[09:25:49] <chrisbovard> Hello everyone. I am using the jquery accordian. How do I open to the 2nd or 3rd item on the accordian?
[09:25:57] <chrisbovard> thanks in advance
[09:27:32] <cfk_> if i already have an html element (div) in a variable, what's the simplest way to get a nested element (nested a few levels below)?
[09:27:56] <markj> chrisbovard you want to use the activate method, so yourAccordion.accordion('activate', index);
[09:28:21] <markj> ?find @ cfk_
[09:28:21] <bot-t1> cfk_, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[09:28:29] <markj> so mydiv.find('whatever');
[09:29:07] <cfk_> wow
[09:29:15] <cfk_> whatever could be a class name?
[09:29:20] <markj> a selector yeah
[09:29:31] <cfk_> awesome
[09:29:38] <markj> if its an immediate child use .children() though
[09:29:45] <markj> but as you say its multiple levels down
[09:29:53] <djQuery> cfk_: $(var).find('.whatever');
[09:30:04] <krz> is there something better than uploadify?
[09:30:40] <djQuery> frz: ?g html5 input file
[09:30:56] <lugzer> i'm so lame at logic
[09:31:12] <djQuery> krz: see ?g html5 file upload

[09:32:33] <Trisox> back
[09:32:39] <chrisbovard> markj - should i post the code? all of the accordians are open now.
[09:33:02] <krz> what exactly does $("#uploadify>div") do?
[09:33:52] <djQuery> krz: gets any children divs of the item with an id of uploadify
[09:34:10] <krz> djQuery: thats strictly for html 5 though
[09:34:14] <krz> not my cup of tea
[09:34:20] <systemfault> What?
[09:34:50] <djQuery> krz: so there are enough shivs to get it to work on ie6 and eventualy 6.7.8 will be dead
[09:35:14] <djQuery> beats having the *shivers* java crap
[09:36:04] <krz> so $("#uploadify>div") will work the same way as $("#uploadify div") right ?
[09:36:17] <systemfault> krz: No.
[09:36:30] <systemfault> krz: > means "direct descendants"
[09:37:15] <djQuery> krz suggest thta you go do some css tutorials.

[09:46:20] <phishbot> anyone know of a ~good~ text hyphenation plugin for jQuery?
[09:47:28] <djQuery> phishbot: could you explain a little better? you are just trying to replace spaces with -
[09:48:12] <mjsilva_home> hi there, does anyone know if there's a plugin to autocomplete dates like SAP does? For example if the user inputs 0501 it expands to 05-01-2011 if user inputs 010109 it expands to 01-01-2009 etc..
[09:48:38] <mjsilva_home> I'm think on building one, just want to make sure nothing alike exists
[09:48:50] <phishbot> i'm looking for soft hyphenation
[09:48:56] <djQuery> mjsilva_home: does it use javascript to doit. just steal it
[09:49:23] <phishbot> djQuery: so for a single word with many characters, if it extends past the width of the container , it splits the word and adds a -
[09:49:29] <mjsilva_home> djQuery no SAP is a JAVA aplication, more closed source than the bank of america :P
[09:49:35] <phishbot> ew SAP :)
[09:49:50] <mjsilva_home> phishbot my feelings exacly :)
[09:50:08] <versatiletech> mjsilva_home: I believe I saw a pluging to do that some years ago
[09:50:13] <versatiletech> plugin*
[09:50:34] <mjsilva_home> it's a great way to input dates
[09:50:53] <mjsilva_home> I'll try to build one
[09:51:35] <mjsilva_home> regex here I go
[09:51:48] <djQuery> ?regex
[09:51:48] <bot-t1> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think â€œI know, I'll use regular expressions.â€ Now they have two problems.
[09:51:54] <Trisox> ?trunquete
[09:51:56] <bot-t1> Trisox, Couldn't find "trunquete" in jQuery Docs.
[09:51:57] <Trisox> or something
[09:52:08] <Trisox> mjsilva_home
[09:52:37] <mjsilva_home> eheh I pretty confortable using regex I don't see another way to do something like this withouth
[09:52:49] <djQuery> mjsilva_home: are there some field formaters that you could use that would actualy do it as they typed.
[09:52:53] <Trisox> train arives have to go to next station..
[09:52:54] <Trisox> brb
[09:53:18] <mjsilva_home> djQuery what you have in mind?
[09:53:25] <djQuery> mjsilva_home: http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/
[09:54:38] <mjsilva_home> djQuery no that's diferent, that just gives you a palcaholder for a pre-formated date
[09:55:06] <mjsilva_home> I really wanted something that expand the date to the right format
[09:55:10] <versatiletech> djQuery: beat me to it
[09:55:40] <versatiletech> mjsilva_home: wouldn't the end result be the same?
[09:55:42] <mjsilva_home> 0102 would become 01-02-2011 - 01 becomes 01-06-2011
[09:56:28] <mjsilva_home> it's a really fast way to input dates
[09:56:30] <djQuery> the problem is what does 1201 become. based on thier region that could have 2 different meanings
[09:56:38] <mjsilva_home> let me check
[09:56:46] <mjsilva_home> 12-01-2011
[09:57:09] <mjsilva_home> I'm in Europe
[09:57:21] <mjsilva_home> first is the day
[09:57:23] <djQuery> but based on thier region that could mean december the 1st or januar the 12th
[09:57:36] <mjsilva_home> America doesn't count :P
[09:58:02] <djQuery> 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,x  damn I cant count to 10
[09:58:29] <mjsilva_home> eheh
[09:59:32] <mjsilva_home> djQuery relevant: http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l65viuYYaU1qasm2ho1_500.jpg
[09:59:47] <mjsilva_home> :D
[09:59:56] <systemfault> Heh...
[09:59:59] <versatiletech> mjsilva_home: it does unless your audience is from Europe and you deny access to US visitors
[10:00:05] <systemfault> US love retarded conventions :/
[10:00:15] <mjsilva_home> versatiletech it's an internal app
[10:00:19] <mjsilva_home> no problem with that
[10:00:20] <djQuery> mjsilva_home: used to do a cal tracking system dates all over the place and users spread all over earth. dates were always a pain.
[10:00:23] <versatiletech> ah ok
[10:01:01] <mjsilva_home> djQuery yeah! I'm lucky this is only target for one type of audience :)
[10:01:48] <cfk_> what would be the best way to read an html div from the page (dinamically created, via js) and send it to a php page somehow?
[10:01:54] <versatiletech> in that case as long as no one reasonably in the future will be from the US, then you should be good
[10:03:19] <mjsilva_home> cfk_: $.post("myfile.php", {data: $("#mydiv").html()}, function(response){ alert(response) });
[10:04:13] <djQuery> mjsilva_home: couldnt you createa  datetime on the fly using setMonth and setDay then to string it an know exactly what format the client is using. parse the string to finger out where the month is based on thier settings.
[10:04:41] <djQuery> sure you will run into 1 guy in organization that moved there that has changed his regional settings
[10:05:58] <mjsilva_home> yeah, I was thinking something like it, for escalability sake
[10:06:28] <mjsilva_home> I'll start with Europe just to get the hang of javascript date functions
[10:06:55] <phishbot> does anyone have a solution for the word-break attribute in Firefox?
[10:08:28] <jinxdone> phishbot, what do you mean?
[10:08:35] <cfk_> mjsilva_home: wow, that's awesome. thanks!!!!
[10:09:01] <mjsilva_home> np
[10:09:03] <systemfault> phishbot: I found none :'(
[10:09:10] <phishbot> :(
[10:09:15] <systemfault> phishbot: Stupid that IE does the right thing...
[10:09:25] <phishbot> systemfault: yeah i know right :(
[10:09:26] <Vaerros> phishbot: you mean the css property word-wrap?
[10:09:31] <phishbot> Vaerros: yes
[10:09:45] <Vaerros> phishbot: what do you mean solution?
[10:09:58] <systemfault> Vaerros: It doesn't work.
[10:10:07] <systemfault> Vaerros: The text will overflow the box
[10:10:08] <phishbot> word-break is also a valid CSS3 property
[10:10:15] <phishbot> http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#word-break
[10:10:26] <systemfault> Yeah.. too bad FF doesn't implements it
[10:10:36] <amh345> good afternoon.  is there a clean way to have 2 hrefs toggle show/hide their respective div's?   i'd like to only have one div visible at a time.   i've written to click functions with show/hide code. but i think it might be possible to achieve this better.
[10:11:12] <dschuett> why won't the tooltip close after clicking on the "next rig" link under the 2006 Volvo 780 on this page --> http://www.lonemountaintruck.com/partners/index2.php
[10:12:41] <Vaerros> systemfault: #css
[10:13:03] <systemfault> Vaerros: Why me? I don't have that problem.
[10:13:06] <dschuett> if i make it a onClick instead of onmousedown it works, however i lose the slide effect of my jquery
[10:13:08] <systemfault> Vaerros: phishbot does.
[10:13:14] <Vaerros> systemfault: yeah, sorry
[10:13:47] <phishbot> i just like dealing with the jQuery community more
[10:13:53] <phishbot> thought maybe there was a jquery plugin
[10:14:03] <phishbot> that was a replacement for word-break
[10:14:04] <Vaerros> phishbot: link, if possible?
[10:14:13] <phishbot> oh , i haven't found one for jQuery BUT
[10:14:16] <phishbot> i did find one really awesome one
[10:14:17] <Vaerros> but word-wrap: break-word should work in 3.5+
[10:14:21] <jinxdone> phishbot, just do word-wrap: break-word; ?
[10:14:30] <versatiletech> mjsilva_home: http://jsbin.com/usene5/2
[10:14:46] <phishbot> Vaerros: http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/

[10:18:53] <ravenzz> seems that you are trying to do something like an accordion, aren't you?
[10:18:54] <ravenzz> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[10:19:08] <amh345> yes. that's exactly it.   thank you
[10:20:12] <ravenzz> anyway yep you could do that, without jQuery ui
[10:20:35] <amh345> without jquery-iu?
[10:20:38] <amh345> ui*
[10:23:15] <ravenzz> yes

[10:24:27] <amh345> search term jquery accordion is only pulling jquery-ui  is it called something else if i dont want to use ui?

[11:07:28] <sgrover> Has anyone worked with jFlow?  It is not staying on one image long enough.  Only option I can see for this is "duration", and that adjusts how long the transition is, not the wait between transitions.
[11:25:42] <alket> Hi, how can i make a function stop after marginTop:0 http://pastebin.com/E3LpUX6G
[11:26:49] <devinrolsen> alket animate comes with a call back function http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[11:27:03] <devinrolsen> so after the marginTop is done being animated, use the callback function.
[11:27:33] <superjacaman> Someone use datatables.net here ?
[11:28:17] <alket> devinrolsen, thank you, I will give it a try now
[11:30:10] <necromancer> does anyone here use remote validation with jquery.validate?
[11:32:03] <Woet> necromancer: i wrote my own validation script
[11:32:11] <Woet> it's not too hard, just do an ajax request and parse it's output
[11:32:32] <Woet> but if you have a question about the plugin, just ask it, i'm sure people can help
[11:32:43] <byteme_> what would be a better way to organize 18 separate "Areas of Practice" ?  http://www.jsonlee.com/AreasOfPractice.aspx
[11:32:49] <necromancer> Woet: my co-worker tried doing that but our form is a little over-complicated
[11:32:57] <byteme_> using a jquery accordion currently
[11:33:15] <necromancer> Woet: and i feel like it's already in jquery.validate and we already use jquery.validate, so why not?
[11:33:30] <Null_> anyone know why I'm getting "Uncaught TypeError" errors in Chrome here: http://therightrealtor.ca/testing/cycle/cycle2.html  but not here http://therightrealtor.ca/testing/cycle/   Both work perfectly without errors in FF.
[11:34:27] <Woet> necromancer: hence i said, just ask your question :)
[11:34:33] <necromancer> ok
[11:34:44] <necromancer> well i'm having an issue when validating uniqueness of a given element
[11:35:04] <necromancer> basically it's running the validator after it validates the form, so it submits the form with invalid data
[11:35:12] <necromancer> because it's an asynchronous request
[11:35:45] <Woet> necromancer: jsfiddle?
[11:36:31] <Anon984> hi
[11:36:56] <necromancer> Woet: i don't think that will be possible, it requires a PHP file to actually check for uniqueness
[11:37:07] <Woet> the javascrip/html is enough
[11:37:08] <TylerE> Is the docs site down for anyone else?
[11:37:10] <Woet> not the validation
[11:37:50] <Woet> Null_: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'cycle'Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'cycle'
[11:37:51] <Woet> oops
[11:37:55] <Woet> Null_: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'cycle'
[11:38:20] <Woet> i'm not seeing any plugin providing .cycle on that cycle2.html, Null_
[11:38:57] <Anon984> hi
[11:38:59] <Null_> Woet: strange...should be in jquery.cycle.lite.js. Wonder why FF is happy
[11:39:00] <ryrych> ajpiano, gnarf: are you there? :)
[11:39:19] <Woet> Null_: did you read your html? :P
[11:39:24] <Woet> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js"</script>
[11:39:29] <Anon984> hellooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[11:39:53] <kojiro> hi
[11:39:55] <Woet> firefox has fixing-your-silly-html-typos features, chrome does not
[11:39:56] <Woet> :)
[11:39:57] <ryrych> hi, but don't flood
[11:40:03] <Null_> haha
[11:40:16] <Anon984> whats up
[11:40:19] <Woet> Null_: doing view source in chrome and looking at the coloring gives a hint too
[11:40:39] <Null_> Woet: thanks, damn chrome being all proper!
[11:41:00] <ryrych> djQuery: do you remembe me asking about passing â€˜thisâ€™ to different scopes?
[11:41:05] <kojiro> I have some js including this: http://dpaste.com/555183/ - I know from the server side that the AJAX fires, but the callback functions never run (I never see the console.log or the alert). What am I doing wrong?
[11:41:13] <ryrych> * asking questions
[11:42:25] <Anon984> hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[11:42:26] <Anon984> how zre you
[11:42:51] <kojiro> well that was special
[11:43:36] <ryrych> Anon984: why do you keep flooding the channel?
[11:45:37] <cfk_> is it possible to use jquery.post so that the browser url is redirected to the php page i'm posting to?
[11:45:49] <kojiro> wtf, $.getJSON(url, data, callback); right? My callback is just a console.log -- why is it never getting called?
[11:45:50] <ryanneufeld> kojiro: do you have that code wrapped in a document ready block?
[11:46:03] <kojiro> ryanneufeld: it's called from within such a block.
[11:46:12] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ kojiro
[11:46:12] <bot-t1> kojiro, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[11:46:21] <ryanneufeld> all of it
[11:46:30] <kojiro> ryanneufeld: dpaste.com is non grata? heh
[11:46:30] <ryanneufeld> not just the part that's not working
[11:46:36] <ryanneufeld> dpaste is fine
[11:46:45] <ryanneufeld> but jsfiddle actually runs the code :p
[11:47:09] <GoGoGarrett> I like jsbin, but I just wish it had a place for css
[11:47:43] <ryanneufeld> GoGoGarrett: once you get used to jsfiddle jsbin doesn't compare I'm afraid
[11:48:47] <GoGoGarrett> I just like the preview on a "new page" so you can see it more so real sized.  I do ctrl+shift+up in jsfiddle which is pretty cool, but i just like the aspect of a full page example
[11:48:53] <Mythmon> how I can reference an attribute of a object in a filter chain? Like $('.class').each().text(something.attr('id'))
[11:49:06] <kojiro> ryanneufeld: any way to tell jsfiddle *not* to tidy up my code?
[11:50:04] <ryrych> Mythmon: $(".class").each(function() {this.attr("id"););
[11:50:09] <kojiro> ryanneufeld: anyway, as asked, http://dpaste.com/555194/ (sorry, jsfiddle just wasn't having any)
[11:51:39] <ryrych> Mython: console.log($(this).attr("id"))
[11:52:34] <ryanneufeld> kojiro: console.log("Getting formats from", portal_url + "/@@markitup_json"); do you see that output?
[11:52:44] <ryrych> Mythmon: argh, I see, â€˜in the chainâ€˜
[11:52:55] <kojiro> ryanneufeld: yes
[11:53:09] <ryanneufeld> okay, wat does it say?
[11:53:35] <kojiro> ryanneufeld: [14:44:28.463] "Getting formats from" "http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@markitup_json"
[11:53:45] <ryanneufeld> okay, so portal url does get set
[11:53:47] <ryanneufeld> good
[11:54:02] <ryanneufeld> wrap your $.getJSON line with a console.log
[11:54:05] <ryanneufeld> see what you get
[11:54:07] <kojiro> k
[11:54:48] <ryrych> Mython: I think there is no way in implicit, but this: $(".class").each(function() { $(this).text = $(this).attr("id");});
[11:54:50] <kojiro> ryanneufeld: [14:54:30.683] [object XrayWrapper [object XMLHttpRequest]]
[11:55:00] <ryanneufeld> k
[11:55:11] <Trisox> http://code.google.com/p/css-x-fire/ hmm
[11:55:47] <ryanneufeld> kojiro: if you happen to open that JSON endpoint in a broswer like chrome
[11:55:50] <ryanneufeld> what do you get?
[11:55:56] <RobW> can someone tell me what plugin this is that's changing the background image: http://www.germancraft.com.au/
[11:55:57] <ryrych> $(this).text(â€¦)
[11:56:04] <Mythmon> ryrych: i am trying it now. it is fine to be at the end of the chain.
[11:56:45] <b0ot> Could anyone take a look at this (lines 38-51): http://paste.ubuntu.com/628126/ and tell me what I'm doing wrong. I'm attempting to read the values of the textfile num.txt on my server and store it in the variable "theY" the php function it references is here: http://pastebin.com/auXZ0G8Q
[11:56:52] <Mythmon> ryrych: though it says 'this.attr is not a function'
[11:57:12] <kojiro> ryanneufeld: you want headers, too, or just the body?
[11:57:13] <ryrych> Mython: sorry for my typos :)
[11:57:22] <ryanneufeld> body
[11:57:28] <ryanneufeld> does it return valid JSON?
[11:57:36] <ryrych> Mython: $(".class").each(function() { $(this).text( $(this).attr("id"));});
[11:58:55] <phmulin> Hey! I am searching for a way to encode an array as an XML string to post it to the server. Any idea how I can do that?
[11:59:31] <b0ot> kojiro, ryrych I think you will see I have made progress since yesterday :p
[11:59:56] <ryrych> b0ot: what are you talking about? :)
[11:59:58] <Trisox> i hate progress :P
[12:00:14] <b0ot> (lines 38-51): http://paste.ubuntu.com/628126/ and tell me what I'm doing wrong. I'm attempting to read the values of the textfile num.txt on my server and store it in the variable "theY" the php function it references is here: http://pastebin.com/auXZ0G8Q
[12:00:29] <ryrych> Trisox: I hate socialist progress :D
[12:00:40] <b0ot> In my attempt to read the content of a text file and store it as a variable
[12:00:41] <Trisox> omg storm
[12:00:44] <pulco> hello
[12:01:01] <Trisox> thunder!!1
[12:01:05] <Trisox> ;lighting
[12:01:08] <kojiro> ryanneufeld: bah, it's not valid.
[12:01:13] <ryrych> b0ot: did I help you somehow? :)
[12:01:29] <kojiro> ryanneufeld: thanks for the help, I'll clean that up.
[12:01:34] <b0ot> ryrych, I believe you were assisting a bit yesterday (I could be mistaken)
[12:01:54] <ryanneufeld> np
[12:01:59] <RobW> can someone tell me what plugin this is that's changing the background image: http://www.germancraft.com.au/
[12:02:03] <ryanneufeld> kojiro: also look at using a deferred
[12:02:11] <ryanneufeld> so $dfd = $getJSON()
[12:02:21] <ryanneufeld> $dfd.done(callbackhere);
[12:02:39] <ryanneufeld> $dfd.fail(failurecallback)
[12:04:21] <ryrych> RobW: looking at it
[12:04:34] <Trisox> men it pooring out side
[12:04:56] <RobW> ryrych: I'm thinking its jquery cycle, but I can't find the code that's initiating it..
[12:05:33] <ryrych> RobW: I think it is a custom plugin written in pure jQuery (not UI)
[12:05:38] <b0ot> Once you have content from $.ajax in text format... is there a way I can just store that as a variable?
[12:06:38] <RobW> ryrych: where are you seeing this
[12:07:16] <Mythmon> ryrych: excellent, that worked. Thanks
[12:08:12] <Trisox> RobW: i think also cycle
[12:08:18] <ryrych> RowW: $.fn.animBg
[12:08:36] <ryrych> RobW: ugly code, though
[12:08:44] <ryrych> Mythmon: cool :)
[12:09:34] <RobW> ryrych: that's not it
[12:09:36] <RobW> I found it
[12:09:47] <ryrych> RobW: it is one image and its position in css is manipulated
[12:09:51] <Trisox> and the winnar is
[12:10:07] <b0ot> Can someone explain to me what is going on in this code after the sucess ? http://paste.ubuntu.com/628126/
[12:10:19] <RobW> ryrych: no
[12:10:24] <RobW> ryrych: It's an XHR request to: http://www.germancraft.com.au/?p=145
[12:10:28] <RobW> that has the javascript..
[12:10:31] <RobW> they were sneaky sneaky
[12:10:50] <RobW> but you can't access it directly lul
[12:11:17] <Trisox> mm baco
[12:12:01] <TylerE> What's the selector for div with a given class AND all child elements
[12:12:02] <Trisox> bacardi cola :P
[12:13:13] <Trisox> $('div.myClass').children(); ??
[12:13:45] <ryrych> TylerE: $("div.class).contents() â† + text nodes
[12:13:47] <Trisox> http://api.jquery.com/children
[12:14:58] <Trisox> ryrych: i think he means children
[12:15:11] <ryrych> RobW: as Trisox pointed out: maybe jquery.cycle.min.js?
[12:15:38] <Trisox> mm cool post http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/06/10/useful-html-css-and-javascript-tools-and-libraries/
[12:16:09] <ryrych> Trisox: ok
[12:16:55] <Trisox> but then again with TylerE description of his question you never know.... it can go any way
[12:17:08] <K1ng> how do i use regex?
[12:17:30] <TylerE> to be clear....
[12:17:36] <ryrych> K1ng: take it and use it :D
[12:17:45] <crankharder> how do I select a range of found elements?  say I want the 1-6 elements that are found
[12:17:53] <ryrych> K1ng: what do you want to achieve?
[12:17:55] <TylerE> <div class="foo"><b>blah</b><span>baz<i>foo</i></span></div>
[12:18:05] <K1ng> a valid user name :D
[12:18:07] <TylerE> I want it to match ALL elements inside the div.foo
[12:18:15] <K1ng> from text field
[12:18:22] <TylerE> including the div itself, the b tag, the span, the i inside the span...
[12:18:50] <ryrych> TylerE: $(".foo").children().andSelf() ?
[12:19:21] <ryrych> K1ng: it depends what is the pattern for user names
[12:20:14] <K1ng> aA-zZ, -._ and 0-9
[12:20:30] <K1ng> no space
[12:20:33] <Trisox> whoo coowl site http://fromme-toyou.tumblr.com/tagged/cinemagraph
[12:20:42] <Trisox> just the design and the gif'
[12:20:50] <ryrych> K1ng: regExp = /\w/ I think
[12:21:13] <ryrych> K1ng: /[\w-\._]/
[12:21:14] <ryrych> sorry
[12:21:16] <b0ot> I am trying to use this function to get the content of a text file
[12:21:23] <b0ot> http://paste.ubuntu.com/628134/
[12:21:44] <K1ng> ryrych, how do i use it?
[12:21:45] <b0ot> Can I just put that in my head of my page and then reference it later
[12:22:02] <ryrych> K1ng: /[w-_\.]+/ â€“ + for many characters
[12:22:03] <Trisox> TylerE: like ryrych sayed .andSelf
[12:22:09] <b0ot> with getValues(num.txt)
[12:22:35] <K1ng> ryrych, thank you but i dont know what is the function to use regex
[12:22:35] <ryrych> K1ng: give me the name of an example user name
[12:22:50] <ryrych> K1ng: I'll show you
[12:23:16] <K1ng> please :D
[12:24:09] <JessicaJ> Hey! Does anyone here know how you create a function that extracts the contents a file on a server?
[12:24:24] <b0ot> apparently not
[12:24:38] <b0ot> been working on it for a couple days
[12:25:59] <spiky> JessicaJ give more details
[12:26:32] <JessicaJ> spiky, I just want to put the contents of a next file into a var
[12:26:37] <Trisox> b0ot: what?
[12:26:41] <JessicaJ> where the textfile is located on the server
[12:27:13] <Trisox> location
[12:27:24] <Trisox> or the actual file
[12:27:43] <JessicaJ> actual content of the file
[12:27:55] <JessicaJ> The file just has a single number in it.
[12:28:12] <ryanneufeld> Trisox: that site reminds me of the newspapers in Harry Potter
[12:28:19] <ryanneufeld> shutup, you all like it
[12:28:57] <Trisox> just open it with load()?
[12:29:26] <Trisox> indeed ryanneufeld :) looks like it a bit
[12:29:41] <Trisox> http://api.jquery.com/load JessicaJ
[12:29:44] <Trisox> that?
[12:29:52] <ryanneufeld> ?load @JessicaJ
[12:29:53] <bot-t1> JessicaJ, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[12:30:09] <ryanneufeld> ?$.load() @ JessicaJ
[12:30:10] <bot-t1> JessicaJ, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[12:30:24] <Trisox> or.. ajax..
[12:30:34] <JessicaJ> Trisox, I have been trying to do it with ajax
[12:30:35] <Trisox> put var in a .data
[12:30:35] <JessicaJ> http://paste.ubuntu.com/628136/
[12:31:07] <JessicaJ> I declare theY outside of the $.ajax
[12:31:18] <JessicaJ> and then try to write content to it under success
[12:31:33] <JessicaJ> but it doesn't seem to work Trisox
[12:31:50] <Trisox> ajax returns data
[12:31:57] <ryrych> K1ng: http://jsfiddle.net/DWYgu/
[12:32:31] <JessicaJ> Trisox, So how would I modify it so I could take what it returns and put it into a variable
[12:32:43] <ryrych> K1ng: exec is most versatile and jquery devs recomend it
[12:32:59] <K1ng> :D
[12:33:01] <K1ng> Thanks :D
[12:33:13] <ryrych> K1ng: you can also use String.match() or String.test()
[12:33:28] <K1ng> :D
[12:34:04] <ryrych> K1ng: String.test() only tests if a regexp matches and return -1 if it doesn't
[12:34:43] <ryrych> K1ng: Regexp.exec() is most valuable if you use more complicated patterns
[12:35:02] <K1ng> um your regex doesnt work :(
[12:35:17] <ryrych> K1ng: which one?
[12:35:30] <K1ng> reload the fiddle
[12:36:06] <ryrych> K1ng: actually it alerts â€˜ryrych85â€™
[12:36:20] <K1ng>  userBad = "bad user",
[12:36:27] <Trisox> something like http://jsfiddle.net/BFLS6/
[12:36:27] <K1ng> alerts bad user :(
[12:36:38] <ryrych> K1ng: :D
[12:36:42] <Trisox> omg!
[12:36:48] <Trisox> lol ryrych
[12:36:50] <K1ng> i mean bad
[12:36:50] <Trisox> :D
[12:36:59] <ryrych> K1ng: because it matches the pattern :D
[12:37:04] <djQuery> yo
[12:37:10] * Trisox sits back while ryrych try's to explane
[12:37:30] <djQuery> ryrych: you got some splainin to do
[12:37:45] <ryrych> Trison: /me is going for beer :D
[12:37:56] <ryrych> djQuery: hi, wait a sec :)
[12:37:58] <Trisox> barcardi cola!!
[12:38:43] <ryrych> Trisox: what is barcardi cola? :)
[12:38:57] <ryanneufeld> ryrych: rum and coke
[12:39:07] <Trisox> http://www.rumpro.ru/postimages/bacardi2%5B1%5D.jpg + coke
[12:39:07] <ryanneufeld> only the best drink on the planet
[12:39:15] <Trisox> indeed
[12:39:15] <JessicaJ> Trisox didn't seem to work
[12:39:21] <Trisox> :(*
[12:39:24] <ryrych> where is it popular?
[12:39:37] <Trisox> ryrych in my house?
[12:39:38] <Trisox> :P
[12:39:54] <Trisox> europe mosly i think
[12:40:09] <Trisox> ryanneufeld: my 3e glass ppfff
[12:40:29] <Trisox> after this one i quit else i get drunk lol
[12:41:19] <ryrych> Trisox: maybe I ve seen this in a supermarket but because I am not alcohol addict, I must have not paid attention
[12:41:41] <Trisox> i'm not either but i was feeling like a drink lonnnnnnggggg day
[12:41:53] <Trisox> and tired i waned to sleep in early
[12:41:55] <Trisox> hehe
[12:42:14] <ryrych> I have weak head :D
[12:42:20] <Trisox> ah ;)
[12:42:28] <Trisox> i had some left from my BD so
[12:42:42] <ryrych> and even 2 beers can zonk me out :D
[12:42:45] <Trisox> it was this or malibu coke
[12:42:58] <Trisox> who 2 beers :D
[12:43:14] <Trisox> low alcohol resistance
[12:43:24] <JessicaJ> Trisox, ryrych Any ideas: I put the code around it for perspective the the part of interest starts at line 40 http://paste.ubuntu.com/628140/
[12:43:31] <ryrych> or stong Polish beer :D
[12:43:38] <JessicaJ> theY doesn't seem to get the value it should
[12:43:43] <Trisox> strong is 7% +
[12:44:19] <Trisox> JessicaJ: does this text file change
[12:44:22] <ryrych> Trisox: here it used to be 8.5% IIRC
[12:44:24] <Trisox> do you write in it?
[12:44:26] <dschuett> http://www.lonemountaintruck.com/partners/index2.php if you click on the first truck (2006 Volvo 780) and then click on the "Next Rig" link in the footer of that div. The tooltip will not go away, even when you navigate to a different page on the site.
[12:44:55] <Woet> dschuett: and how have you told the tooltip to go away?
[12:45:18] <ryrych> Trisox: which one?
[12:45:37] <Trisox> do you write in it? JessicaJ
[12:45:38] <Trisox> :P
[12:45:40] <dschuett> Woet: i have tried adding $('.effect').tipsy({delayOut: 1}); in my swapContent function
[12:45:50] <ryrych> OK
[12:45:55] <JessicaJ> Trisox, are you asking if I wrote in the num.txt file?
[12:46:05] <JessicaJ> yes... all the file contains is 1111
[12:46:10] <ryrych> djQuery: sorry
[12:46:13] <Trisox> yea do yo do that with php or something?
[12:46:23] <necromancer> in jQuery.validate, how do you apply a validation rule to an entire class of elements?
[12:46:33] <ryrych> djQuery: could you take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/ndPaH/7/
[12:46:37] <Woet> dschuett: "if you wish to remove the tooltip by setting the title attribute to an empty string, set the original-title attribute instead"
[12:46:59] <ryrych> djQuery: I think I figured it out but I would like to know othersâ€™ opinion
[12:47:35] <Trisox> ryrych: what do you try to do there?
[12:47:48] <Trisox> lightbox resize something
[12:48:14] <ryrych> Trisox: many instances - one DOM structure idiom
[12:48:39] <Trisox> mmm
[12:49:46] <ryrych> Trisox: it is all about passing â€˜thisâ€™ to relevant jQuery UI instances
[12:49:52] <ryrych> of plugin
[12:50:28] <Trisox> i got that from the comments
[12:50:28] <Trisox> :P
[12:50:50] <ryrych> I am looking for the best approach
[12:51:23] <ryrych> it does its job but I would like to get know othersâ€™ opinion
[12:51:39] <gopus> I am sure that I am missing something really basic, but why is the following one line of jquery code not working? : http://jsfiddle.net/DGP6h/
[12:51:42] <ryrych> it is better to learn from the best
[12:52:19] <JessicaJ> Trisox, The num.txt file will be updated constantly through a bash script. The contents are actually extracted with a littlte php file... the fileread.php
[12:52:43] <jovrtn> gopus: you're missing an opening <
[12:53:00] <gopus> jovrtn: *sighs*
[12:53:07] <gopus> jovrtn: thank you :-P
[12:53:11] <jovrtn> np :)
[12:53:48] <gopus> errr no
[12:53:51] <gopus> I mean that's accurate
[12:53:55] <gopus> but there is a javascript error
[12:53:59] <gopus> it demands a ;
[12:54:05] <gopus> *thinks*
[12:54:07] <Trisox> ?jslint
[12:54:08] <bot-t1> JSLint,The JavaScript Code Quality Tool - http://www.jslint.com/
[12:54:16] <gopus> thanks Trisox
[12:54:34] <sean`> jshint
[12:55:43] <gopus> that doesn't seem to consider jquery
[12:55:48] <gopus> weird...
[12:55:51] <Trisox> gopus: close off you css
[12:56:06] <Trisox> padding:5px;
[12:56:20] <Trisox> dont be slopy ;)
[12:56:25] <nirvisual> ping
[12:56:33] <Trisox> pong!
[12:56:35] <ryrych> gopus: use firebug or other built-in debugger
[12:56:51] <nirvisual> ding
[12:57:09] <gopus> Trisox: so be it but that doesn't seem to matter...
[12:57:14] <gopus> okay firebug will do...
[12:57:18] <rns> how do I make my jquery UI tabs smaller?  any way other than setting font-size: 55% ?
[12:57:19] <gopus> I will find that.
[12:57:39] <Trisox> well its not in your code you posted then
[12:57:42] <JessicaJ> jovrtn, Any idea what I might be doing wrong http://paste.ubuntu.com/628140/

[12:58:58] <bot-t1> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[12:59:00] <Trisox> ^^
[12:59:27] <ryrych> how does it work? ?botsnack
[12:59:32] <ryrych> hm :D
[12:59:33] <Trisox> yup
[12:59:41] <ryrych> I am not good at IRC commands
[12:59:42] <ryrych> :)
[12:59:46] <JessicaJ> Trisox, where would i put the console.log(data)
[12:59:52] <JessicaJ> ?botsnack

[13:00:09] <GoGoGarrett> ahh
[13:00:09] <ryrych> hehe
[13:00:09] <Trisox> in succes @ JessicaJ
[13:00:17] <Trisox> and the look with firebug
[13:00:22] <Trisox> it will return the data
[13:00:24] <Trisox> or not..
[13:00:38] <ryrych> djQuery: ?
[13:04:09] <Engin> can I have artifical states like .foo:bar ?
[13:04:12] <djQuery>  yes?
[13:04:29] <jovrtn> JessicaJ: what's in num.txt?
[13:04:39] <Trisox> a number
[13:04:41] <Trisox> like 687
[13:04:42] <ryrych> djQuery: did you look over it?
[13:04:44] <gnarf> Engin: easier (and more supported by browsers) to use two classes
[13:04:47] <gnarf> .foo.activated
[13:05:11] <ryrych> oh, and there is gnarf :)
[13:05:14] <gnarf> you can't write your own psuedo selectors for CSS
[13:05:22] <Engin> gnarf, yeah I know but in this case there are 9 distinct #foo[0-8] and each has a two more states
[13:05:27] <Trisox> gnarf can
[13:05:33] <Engin> each state for each element is distinct too
[13:05:43] <ryrych> gnarf: I did what we were taking about; could you take a look at it?
[13:05:48] <Engin> so I can do it with .foo1 .foo1state1
[13:05:55] <Engin> a bit ugly
[13:06:02] <gnarf> Engin: .foo1.state1
[13:06:07] <gnarf> is class="foo1 state1"
[13:06:12] <Engin> i know
[13:06:24] <djQuery> ryrych: been away look at what?
[13:06:24] <Trisox> not ugly... practical
[13:06:41] <ryrych> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/ndPaH/7/
[13:08:24] <K1ng> can ayone help me with this please?
[13:08:25] <K1ng> http://jsfiddle.net/DWYgu/11/
[13:08:34] <jovrtn> JessicaJ: the JS side of things seems to be working fine, it's just having trouble reading your file
[13:08:37] <K1ng> i am trying to validate user :)

[13:08:59] <magcius> does anybody remember the name of the bind()-like function that retains events even after they're detached from DOM?
[13:09:09] <JessicaJ> jovrtn, I don't know why... I'm able to view the file fine extracting the code
[13:09:18] <ryrych> djQuery: I know, thatâ€™s in the real widget; but do you think of it?
[13:09:19] <jovrtn> what's inside of num.txt?
[13:09:19] <GoGoGarrett> .live()
[13:09:20] <ryrych> is it good?
[13:09:22] <ch3mical> So I'm wonder if it would be easy to take a JSON string and traverse it and turn the values into elements... something like { "this":{ "key":"value" }, (repeat X times) } and do $('value').wrap('<'+key+'/>') for each item, including wrapping the nested groups with the outer key... ?
[13:09:22] <GoGoGarrett> .delgate()
[13:09:22] <JessicaJ> I just can't seem to store the info into the var "theY"
[13:09:25] <ch3mical> windering*
[13:09:27] <jovrtn> and why do you need a php script to read it?
[13:09:29] <ch3mical> wondering* ugh
[13:09:33] <JessicaJ> jovrtn, a single number like 123
[13:09:46] <jovrtn> is the txt file generated from somewhere?
[13:09:50] <ryrych> djQuery: my widget is almost complete btw
[13:09:54] <JessicaJ> jovrtn, the only way I could figure out how to read a textfile
[13:10:10] <JessicaJ> jovrtn, the txt file is rewritten from time to time with a bash script
[13:10:10] <ch3mical> I'm not sure of the best way to approach this
[13:10:14] <gnarf> ch3mical: you could $.each it into another object
[13:10:15] <magcius> GoGoGarrett, what's the difference between .live() and .delegate()?
[13:10:18] <jovrtn> ah
[13:10:18] <gar_onn> K1ng: what are you trying to do?
[13:10:18] <gnarf> or string
[13:10:29] <djQuery> ryrych: why are u extending it instead of putting everything in the creation?
[13:10:38] <jovrtn> you could just output it as a .json file and read it with getJSON
[13:10:50] <jovrtn> and skip the php processing
[13:10:52] <JessicaJ> jovrtn, how would i do that
[13:10:56] <ch3mical> gnarf: That's what I'm leaning towards, but I'm not sure how to get the nested key pairs into their containing key
[13:10:57] <Trisox> evening ch3mical
[13:11:03] <gnarf> ch3mical: got sample input / output?
[13:11:08] <K1ng> i just want to validate username with a-z-0-9 .-_

[13:11:15] <ch3mical> Trisox: hi
[13:11:16] <ryrych> djQuery: I am sure I did what gnarf and ajpiano and you were talking about
[13:11:20] <ryrych> gnarf ?
[13:11:23] <kojiro> I fail at ajax. How do I get the *subobject* at 'text/x-web-markdown' out of this response? http://dpaste.com/555230/
[13:11:26] <Trisox> yo
[13:11:26] <GoGoGarrett> magcius http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/quick-tip-the-difference-between-live-and-delegate/
[13:11:36] <GoGoGarrett> Good reference I like a lot
[13:11:57] <ch3mical> gnarf: plus not all of the "root" key pairs will have sub pairs
[13:12:02] <Trisox> i hate pastes that are not jsfiddle :P
[13:12:09] <Trisox> jsfiddle is the bomb
[13:12:09] <gnarf> ch3mical: sample input / output?
[13:12:10] <ch3mical> Trisox: agreed
[13:12:15] <Trisox> ;)
[13:12:21] <ch3mical> gnarf: coming right up
[13:12:29] <jovrtn> JessicaJ: one sec let me make an example
[13:12:30] <magcius> there's probably a much better way I can do this.
[13:12:30] <gnarf> kojiro: data["text/x-web-markdown"]
[13:12:44] <ryrych> K1ng: I thought I told you how to do this?
[13:12:55] <JessicaJ> jovrtn, :)
[13:12:59] <ryrych> Trisox can confirm :D
[13:13:03] <magcius> my code is at http://fpaste.org/wSwz/
[13:13:03] <K1ng> ryrych, yeah.. i am using your code but it doesnt do as i wanted :(
[13:13:05] <grey> When you set a val on a select input, does it fire .change()?
[13:13:18] <magcius> yeah, I'm still learning jQuery best practices
[13:13:53] <gnarf> kojiro: assuming it is really an object, and not a string still
[13:13:55] <ryrych> K1ng: because you have not told what input you are using
[13:14:11] <magcius> the .live method doesn't work :(
[13:14:17] <dschuett> http://www.lonemountaintruck.com/partners/index2.php if you click on the first truck (2006 Volvo 780) and then click on the "Next Rig" link in the footer of that div. The tooltip will not go away, even when you navigate to a different page on the site.
[13:14:18] <ryrych> my snippet does this trick
[13:15:26] <gnarf> ch3mical: afk for ~10 min, ill be back to check on ya ;)

[13:16:13] <AfroTurf> why won't .bind("blur") fire when there is nothing in the field.. fires fine if i type something though
[13:16:33] <Silowyi> sigh, I'm too tired today to figure this out. What does jQuery() return when the selector matches no objects?
[13:16:46] <ryrych> gar_onn: http://jsfiddle.net/DWYgu/
[13:16:49] <rns> I want to use auto height on jquery UI accordion, but I also want to set a 500px max height.  The accordion is currently expanding beyond that height since the content of the accordion is taller.  Any ideas?
[13:16:57] <ryrych> gar_onn: and you should escape dot
[13:17:04] <K1ng> gar_onn, nice one. you fail.. http://jsfiddle.net/brnKa/1/
[13:17:40] <kojiro> gnarf: facepalm.
[13:18:11] <kojiro> gnarf: My real code was right. My console.log was pointed at the wrong object.
[13:18:29] <gar_onn> ryrych: what dot?
[13:18:42] <gar_onn> ooh, the one in the regExp
[13:18:49] <MaxMeents> I can't seem to find a tree traversal method that only looks one children (doesn't sound right) deep
[13:18:58] <ryrych> gar_onn: and userBad.match(regExp) :)
[13:19:06] <JessicaJ> I hate ajax
[13:19:24] <JKarsrud1> AfroTurf: works just fine here: http://jsfiddle.net/beyondsanity/DESmq/

[13:19:42] <ryrych> gar_onn: I explain it to him but â€¦ ;D
[13:19:53] <gar_onn> wtf
[13:19:59] <gar_onn> how come it worked?
[13:20:07] <ryrych> magix
[13:20:10] <ryrych> c
[13:20:42] <Silowyi> anyone?
[13:20:53] <Silowyi> What does jQuery() return when the selector matches no elements?
[13:20:58] <magcius> Silowyi, why not try it and see?
[13:21:22] <djQuery> hmmm searching there are a lot of xml to json but dont seem to be any json to xml
[13:21:26] <JessicaJ> jovrtn, any luck?
[13:21:30] <iman> are there any tools to decrease JQuery library volume, it's about 600 kb when it's going to load on we page - it;s terrible
[13:21:34] <magcius> anyway, .live() isn't working, fuck this
[13:21:45] <ryrych> iman: minify it
[13:21:46] <Silowyi> magcius: because I am not very well versed in javascript reflection methods
[13:21:47] <jovrtn> JessicaJ: yeah just getting it to work cross-domain so I can test it
[13:21:53] <ch3mical> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/AZgks/2/ added a note
[13:21:59] <Silowyi> magcius: I guess I'll just alert() it. :P
[13:21:59] <JessicaJ> ok just checking :p
[13:22:12] <iman> ryrych: how can i do that
[13:22:27] <MaxMeents> for example, class1 > class 2 > class3. Is there a method to get just class2 from class1 in case class2 is also below class3?  $('.class1').oneLower('.class2') //only get class2 if its dirrectly bleow class1
[13:22:28] <ryrych> iman: you can download the minified version
[13:22:57] <ch3mical> MaxMeents: see ?:not
[13:22:57] <bot-t1> MaxMeents, :not(selector): Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[13:23:02] <iman> ryrych: there isn't tools to remove unseud function ?
[13:23:30] <ryrych> iman: jQuery is 229KB (uncompressed) and 31 (minified and gzipped)
[13:23:31] <ch3mical> MaxMeents: you can do :not(.class3 > .class2), which should stop it from grabbing .class2 under class3
[13:23:44] <ryrych> iman: did you mean jQuery UI?
[13:23:51] <ch3mical> MaxMeents: read about the not-selector to see how to use it
[13:23:56] <MaxMeents> yeah, the only thing was I was trying to be effiecent. I thought I was missing out on a method
[13:23:57] <ryrych> iman: I don't think so there is such a tool

[13:24:39] <MaxMeents> anyways, thank you ch3mical
[13:24:52] <Trisox> Movie time! cu all
[13:24:54] <ch3mical> MaxMeents: :not is very efficient
[13:24:54] <screensilently> hello, i have a simple TAB jquery script, it works but when I click an item from the menu it scrolls down to the div area, something i don't want to happen.
[13:25:20] <ch3mical> MaxMeents: don't confuse it with .not, which wouldn't be as efficient
[13:25:32] <ryrych> gnarf: can we chat? I was waiting for you all day :)
[13:25:47] <ch3mical> .not would have to parse your list twice, but :not only processes it once
[13:25:52] <gnarf> ryrych: thats your first mistake, try asking the channel - there are other people here who are good at this shit too
[13:25:55] <MaxMeents> lol, exactly what I just did.
[13:26:42] <ch3mical> Of course there are reasons to use .not versus :not, but in your case I think you want :not
[13:26:58] <screensilently> please someone look to my previous question.
[13:27:12] <gnarf> ch3mical: http://jsfiddle.net/AZgks/3/
[13:27:22] <gnarf> ch3mical: of couse the \n's aren't really needed, just make it easier to read
[13:27:46] <ryrych> gnarf: sorry, I drop in from time to time; I introduces you my problem so I thought you are the most appropriate :(

[13:28:34] <ch3mical> gnarf: is that meant to replace if typeof statements?
[13:29:00] <ryrych> gnarf: right, and I wanted to show you my code to get the opinion
[13:29:12] <screensilently> I added "return false;" at the end and it worked. bye.
[13:29:25] <gnarf> ryrych: sure - paste away I guess
[13:30:20] <ch3mical> This is cool, I have no idea how I completely missed the $.type function
[13:30:59] <ch3mical> Looks like I can definitely replace "if typeof" statements with this

[13:32:01] <ryrych> gnarf: sorry, but sometimes it is really hard to get help in this channel ;(
[13:32:19] <ch3mical> I try to help as much as I can
[13:32:41] <jovrtn> JessicaJ: will num.txt live on our own server?
[13:32:53] <gnarf> its looking pretty decent ryrych
[13:33:16] <gnarf> the only thing I'd really point out at this point is that you're digging pretty deep into data structures for data
[13:33:55] <ryrych> gnarf: cool :) so what would you suggest for data?
[13:33:58] <gnarf> not sure how I feel about the "data.side"
[13:34:21] <ryrych> gnarf: do you mean it is not verbose?
[13:34:38] <gnarf> like that _next() function is hard to read
[13:34:40] <ryrych> eh, verbatim
[13:34:48] <Nicolas_Leonidas> var facebook_page_id = $('.facebook_page_id').val();
[13:34:50] <gnarf> it might be easier if you broke it out into better var assignments
[13:34:52] <Nicolas_Leonidas> why is this undefined?
[13:35:00] <Nicolas_Leonidas> facebook_page_id is an input of type text
[13:35:04] <gnarf> also, just for minification purposes... avoid using a ton of "this" calls
[13:35:12] <gnarf> so like var data = this.data is useful
[13:35:22] <gnarf> minified that becomes var a=this.data;
[13:36:10] <Jon47> gnarf is the gain in minification worth the overhead of extra variables in memory?
[13:36:24] <ryrych> gnarf: I see, the deeper, the worse efficiency
[13:36:42] <gnarf> Jon47: yes - if you are copying object references for sure --- long strings *shrug*
[13:36:53] <dabear> extra variables?
[13:36:55] <dabear> how so?
[13:37:04] <gnarf> Jon47: it doesn't really use any "extra" memory to assign an object
[13:37:20] <gnarf> i suppose it takes up a var in the stack
[13:37:22] <gnarf> but thats it
[13:37:25] <Jon47> is it by reference?
[13:37:41] <gnarf> Jon47: yes, anything other than literals copies by reference
[13:37:50] <gnarf> well not literals
[13:38:02] <gnarf> someone with a better JS education could tell you the real term for Number / String
[13:38:04] <gnarf> Boolean
[13:38:16] <necromancer> hey how do you validate groups of elements using jQuery.validate?
[13:38:20] <gnarf> I know it, just can't think of it
[13:38:25] <gnarf> Scalars?
[13:38:29] <JessicaJ> jovrtn, yes
[13:38:32] <necromancer> i'm writing validation for a form of which i don't know the content necessarily
[13:38:38] <ryrych> gnarf: thank you very much, now Iâ€™m going to implement it :)
[13:38:39] <Jon47> yeah scalar
[13:38:57] <JessicaJ> jovrtn, The num.txt file right now is created on the server
[13:39:02] <necromancer> so there might be any number of elements in that form that are required, what i'd like to do is add a class to those elements so they can be validated for that
[13:39:23] <gnarf> ryrych: i might think about making your "next" function called from a _handleClick that does the left/right check and just passes 1 or -1 to _next
[13:39:35] <gnarf> then an _inRange or something
[13:40:31] <MaxMeents> just wanted a second opinion. Everything past the id uses a class because there are multiple num of each but I think I might be doing something wrong. I just want to make sure I understand the best way to use selectors. http://s2.postimage.org/eswhdnpse/Screen_Shot019.png
[13:41:33] <gnarf> ryrych: but this is all just general "code design" type optimizations
[13:41:46] <gnarf> Someone else around here might have some ideas
[13:42:03] <ryrych> gnarf: cool :)
[13:42:05] <gnarf> ryrych: the general idea is that anytime you run into a function, you should be able to compile it in your head :)
[13:42:15] <jovrtn> JessicaJ: replace your $.ajax call with this: $.get('num.txt', function(data) { var theY = data; series.addPoint([x, theY], true, true); });
[13:44:39] <MaxMeents> does anyone know if it's still more efficent to write out a selector from an ID if you have to include 7-10 classes to get to the selection you want?
[13:44:47] <JessicaJ> what about the completion of the setInterval
[13:44:54] <JessicaJ> , 1000});
[13:45:21] <jovrtn> leave that
[13:45:39] <jovrtn> just the $.ajax block
[13:45:45] <ryrych> gnarf: one more question: do you think it is good to use $.proxy() and call it in the same time?
[13:45:54] <gnarf> ryrych: no
[13:45:55] <ryrych> what about function.call()?
[13:46:04] <gnarf> ryrych: depends on the condition tho
[13:46:20] <gnarf> ryrych: fn.call( scope, arg1, arg2 ) is what I generally use
[13:46:29] <gnarf> I only really use proxy when binding events in UI
[13:46:41] <ryrych> ok
[13:47:19] <JessicaJ> jovrtn, but the series.addPoint wasn't in the ajax call and you have it included in the section that I'm to replace it with... so I have 2 copies of it
[13:47:28] <jovrtn> er
[13:47:36] <jovrtn> yeah get rid of the addPoint outside of the ajax call
[13:48:43] <Engin> .foo>.bar[x=y]
[13:49:09] <Engin> I'm expecting <div class="foo"><div class="bar" x="y"></div></div> to be slected
[13:50:06] <cimi> hey everyone
[13:50:08] <cimi> is there any way of running the jQuery test suite on the final build file?
[13:50:18] <cimi> I'm trying to benchmark several minifiers
[13:50:18] <jovrtn> Engin: works for me
[13:50:22] <jovrtn> Engin: in chrome 12
[13:50:23] <Engin> hmm
[13:50:29] <Engin> this is chrome 12 too
[13:51:22] <JessicaJ> jovrtn, I'm not having any luck... this is what I have: http://paste.ubuntu.com/628172/
[13:51:36] <cimi> and I want to run the test suite against just one file, I noticed the tests re-request all modules (src/core,js etc.)
[13:52:03] <Kambfhase> Engin: quote the y !
[13:52:06] <jovrtn> JessicaJ: make sure to set the correct path to num.txt, that snippet assumes num.txt is in the same directory as the html document
[13:52:15] <JessicaJ> yep
[13:52:15] <Engin> oh mine works too sorry
[13:52:19] <JessicaJ> jovrtn, it is
[13:52:43] <codyrobbins> How do I use $(document).ready() from within a class? It overrides this and then I can't access any methods on my class anymore.
[13:53:42] <jovrtn> JessicaJ: and the only thing in the text file is a number?
[13:53:49] <JessicaJ> currently
[13:53:50] <JessicaJ> 26
[13:53:54] <jovrtn> hrm
[13:54:42] <jovrtn> it's working for me
[13:54:44] <jovrtn> on my server
[13:54:50] <JessicaJ> on a side note: I can't view the page if I do http://localhost/dyanmic-update.htm only if I do file:///localhost/var/www/dynamic-update.htm
[13:55:11] <JessicaJ> I see nothing at all with firefox
[13:55:18] <JessicaJ> and only see it with file with opera
[13:55:36] <JessicaJ> (running ubuntu 10.04) with apache for server
[13:55:54] <jovrtn> what do you mean
[13:55:57] <jovrtn> that the page won't even load?
[13:56:01] <garbagegod> id like to have a link/piece of text that when you click on it it turns into a textarea, i know to use onclick to see when someone clicks it, but how do i insert the textarea tags around the text?
[13:56:34] <Kambfhase> codyrobbins: either use $.proxy or save a reference to `this`.
[13:58:19] <bill20r3> How would I bind an event to trigger when the document height changes?   (it's not changing due to a resize(). )
[13:58:24] <codyrobbins> Kambfhase: Saving a reference to 'this' doesn't work, because some methods in the class are called varyingly by submethods from both within and without the ready handler.
[13:58:32] <codyrobbins> Kambfhase: What is $.proxy? There's no mention of it in the documentation.
[13:59:05] <GoGoGarrett> Can anyone point to me why my counter isn't incriminating
[13:59:06] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/GoGoGarrett/89GKG/
[13:59:13] <JessicaJ> jovrtn, correct
[13:59:13] <jovrtn> JessicaJ: http://ovrtn.com/test/jessica.html
[13:59:27] <codyrobbins> Kambfhase: Oh, never mind, I found it. Search apparently doesn't think it exists, though.
[13:59:44] <JessicaJ> wow that works fantastic
[13:59:55] <jovrtn> JessicaJ: take a look at the source, make sure all your scripts are included properly, etc
[14:00:41] <Kambfhase> :)
[14:00:42] <garbagegod> cmon gaize
[14:00:44] <garbagegod> halp :3
[14:03:49] <GoGoGarrett> ah never mind, i'm just reassigning it every time it's clicked. :l
[14:03:57] <JessicaJ> lol jovrtn I copied/pasted the source code and it doesn't work for me
[14:04:02] <JessicaJ> it acts all funny
[14:04:45] <jovrtn> can you be more specific? does the chart show up at all?
[14:04:54] <Kambfhase> garbagegod: that is hard to do. maybe sarch fo an plugin or use HTML5s contenteditable
[14:05:20] <codyrobbins> Kambfhase: Thank you, jQuery.proxy is exactly what I needed!
[14:05:27] <Kambfhase> :)
[14:05:32] <RobW> can this be done in jquery: http://fladdict.net/exp/ginnyeffect/
[14:05:38] <RobW> (or even close)
[14:06:00] <Kambfhase> i thoery, yes.
[14:06:20] <JessicaJ> jovrtn, So on yours everything works perfectly. On mine the chart is initialized (ie I get all the dots and the line). However than immediatly have the chart has been drawn for the first time the line disappears
[14:06:32] <JessicaJ> and then with each increment the furthest left dot disappears
[14:07:09] <Kambfhase> GoGoGarrett: you are doing it wrong
[14:07:12] <GoGoGarrett> do while loop ftw
[14:07:17] <GoGoGarrett> I got it :]
[14:07:25] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/GoGoGarrett/89GKG/1/
[14:07:41] <garbagegod> its as simple as
[14:07:47] <garbagegod> how do i output a string to the document
[14:08:04] <garbagegod> specifically the string <textarea> blah blah blah </textarea>
[14:08:17] <Kambfhase> try .text()
[14:08:20] <Silver1> hey
[14:08:22] <jovrtn> JessicaJ: that doesn't sound good :S
[14:08:23] <JessicaJ> ps.. jovrtn i don't know if you changed something on your server but now it just stays at zero
[14:08:23] <garbagegod> thx
[14:08:33] <Silver1> what's the difference between .load() and $.load() ?
[14:08:37] <jovrtn> yeah I was tinkering around trying to duplicate your error
[14:08:42] <jovrtn> I deleted the num.txt file
[14:08:46] <jovrtn> it's back now though
[14:08:54] <RobW> can this be done in jquery: http://fladdict.net/exp/ginnyeffect/ - click around
[14:09:13] <JessicaJ> now it's working again
[14:10:23] <Silver1> are .load() and $.load() friends and what are they like?
[14:11:00] <ElGoorf> having some slight difficulty, i have a form loaded to a page with jquery, and I want to stop the form submitting by default but it isnt happening: http://pastebin.com/vfiFM8Wb
[14:11:40] <ElGoorf> Silver1, one loads a file, the other acts when an object has laoded
[14:11:42] <JessicaJ> jovrtn, stupid question in sourcing something would // indicate the home diretory ie /var/www
[14:12:09] <JessicaJ> so if jquery was in /var/home/js/jquery-1.5.1.min.us I would say //js/jquery-1.5.1.min.us
[14:12:36] <jovrtn> i think // is the current directory
[14:12:45] <Silver1> ElGoorf: brilliant. thanks a lot ! :)
[14:13:01] <ElGoorf> surely no slashes at all is current directory
[14:13:17] <jovrtn> er yeah, // and / are equivalent
[14:13:36] <jovrtn> so you don't *need* to use //
[14:14:31] <JessicaJ> <script type="text/javascript" src="//js/highcharts.js"></script>
[14:14:41] <garbagegod> ah, i see the problem now
[14:14:43] <JessicaJ>        <script src="//js/jquery-1.5.1.min.js"></script>
[14:14:51] <JessicaJ>         <script type="text/javascript" src="//js/modules/exporting.js"></script>
[14:14:51] <garbagegod> you cant insert html directly into the page and expect it to be parsed
[14:14:56] <jovrtn> just use /js/highcharts.js
[14:15:02] <gnarf> jovrtn: not true... // is the current protocol
[14:15:14] <jovrtn> ah
[14:15:27] <jovrtn> functionally though they take you to the same directory?
[14:15:27] <garbagegod> is there any way to do this?
[14:15:37] <JessicaJ> I'm pretty sure something is messed up with the way I'm sourcing things
[14:15:38] <gnarf> jovrtn: no
[14:15:45] <garbagegod> ill just make a div thats hidden with the textarea in it.... sheeeeitt
[14:15:46] <gnarf> jovrtn: the // doesn't give you domain name
[14:15:52] <gnarf> /domainname.com/directory/file
[14:15:55] <gnarf>  //domainname.com/directory/file
[14:16:14] <gnarf> it just keeps http: or https:
[14:16:44] <jovrtn> ah right
[14:17:10] <JessicaJ> Well everything is in /var/www/....
[14:17:22] <JessicaJ> but the web host thinks /var/www is the root directory
[14:18:13] <jovrtn> that's sort of the web server's job, to give you a 'root' for your web documents
[14:18:27] <jovrtn> so /js/highcharts.js refers to /var/www/
[14:18:31] <jovrtn> er
[14:18:48] <jovrtn> to /var/www/js/
[14:20:48] <JessicaJ> ok
[14:20:50] <JessicaJ> still no luck
[14:20:57] <JessicaJ> now everything is blank
[14:21:02] <ravenzz> what's the matter?
[14:22:56] <RobW> can this be done in jquery: http://fladdict.net/exp/ginnyeffect/ - click around
[14:24:37] <JessicaJ> ravenzz, the problem is that jovrtn was kind enough to help fix some code for me and it works fine on their machine but doesnt work for me
[14:24:39] <JessicaJ> on my server
[14:25:05] <ravenzz> nice
[14:25:10] <jovrtn> http://ovrtn.com/test/jessica.html is my demo
[14:26:13] <Kambfhase> RobW: no. not in 10 lines of code.
[14:26:31] <JessicaJ> I think their might be some permissions issue
[14:26:42] <Kambfhase> in thoery yes, but you'd need 500 lines of yode having nothing to do with jQuery
[14:26:43] <JessicaJ> I am able to access anything in /var/www and see it via local host
[14:27:05] <JessicaJ> but nothing in any further folder
[14:27:14] <JessicaJ> I get Forbidden - Permission denied
[14:27:44] <ravenzz> Could I take a look at your code?
[14:29:13] <ravenzz> <JessicaJ> on a side note: I can't view the page if I do http://localhost/dyanmic-update.htm only if I do file:///localhost/var/www/dynamic-update.htm
[14:29:23] <ravenzz> you should edit your webserver conf
[14:29:24] <gnarf> RobW: who cares, its a crappy looking effect anyway ;)
[14:30:14] <ravenzz> Actually seems that your webserver root is /
[14:30:15] <ravenzz> :|
[14:30:29] <sykopomp> ahaha
[14:30:31] <ravenzz> that's mh dangerous
[14:30:32] <ravenzz> ?!
[14:30:38] <tehOPEologist> hey all, i'm getting a Security error" code: "1000 on my page and was wondering wtf it means and how to fix it
[14:30:52] <tehOPEologist> this is under the error in the console:
[14:30:53] <tehOPEologist> if(sheets[sheetIndex].cssRules || sheets[sheetIndex].rules){
[14:32:00] <gf3> oh shit, not error 1000
[14:32:32] <Kambfhase> its over 900!
[14:32:36] <tehOPEologist> lol
[14:33:11] <djQuery> error 1000 meant the darleks are coming doesnt it?
[14:33:12] <tehOPEologist> any idea what it is?
[14:36:39] <tehOPEologist> no one?
[14:36:42] <tehOPEologist> do you need a link to see it?
[14:36:46] <tehOPEologist> it only shows up in firefox
[14:36:51] <tehOPEologist> and prevents a plugin from working
[14:37:37] <Kambfhase> ?p @ tehOPEologist
[14:37:37] <bot-t1> tehOPEologist, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[14:38:19] <JessicaJ> lol
[14:38:21] <JessicaJ> I give up
[14:38:29] <JessicaJ> jovrtn, thank you for your help
[14:38:37] <JessicaJ> I will probably try some more tomorrow
[14:39:24] <tehOPEologist> http://jsfiddle.net/SaFxg/
[14:39:32] <tehOPEologist> that's the javascript code that's producing the error
[14:43:07] <tehOPEologist> anyone?
[14:43:17] <Kambfhase> The problem is probably because your css file is hosted in another domain and you're trying to access cssRules.
[14:43:37] <Kambfhase> thats what stack overflow says
[14:44:43] <Kambfhase> For those mentioning security errors in Firebug, please check if the error occurs on a web URL. We can only replicate this issue when running locally.
[14:45:13] <tehOPEologist> can you explain what that means?
[14:45:23] <tehOPEologist> because the style.css is on the same server as the plugin..
[14:46:23] <Kambfhase> i am just checking the creates web site.
[14:48:49] <Kambfhase> dunno, sorry.
[14:49:16] <tehOPEologist> ok, thanks.
[14:52:45] <WilliamLH> Can anyone tell me: if I use .ajax and receive a document that is XML with and that XML contains a stylesheet pointing to a valid xsl, I can get the processed output instead of the XML?
[14:57:06] <colin3440> is there a closest() function that traverses DOWN the DOM tree?
[14:57:21] <Kambfhase> ?find @ colin3440
[14:57:24] <bot-t1> colin3440, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[14:57:45] <colin3440> oh duh. thanks
[15:06:41] <WilliamLH> What is the best way to transform an XML response?
[15:08:29] <colin3440> if I have a list (<ul><li id='mainli'></li><li></li></ul>) and I want to select the li after #mainli how do I do that?
[15:09:58] <hye> use jquery selectors
[15:10:09] <GoGoGarrett> $('li').next()
[15:10:23] <GoGoGarrett> or #mainli .next
[15:14:44] <ElGoorf> having some slight difficulty, i have a form loaded to a page with jquery, and I want to stop the form submitting by default but it isnt happening: http://pastebin.com/vfiFM8Wb please can someone tell me where i've gone wrong?
[15:14:53] <quuxman> This is probably an old question, but I'm drawing a blank here: writing a basic drag and drop feature, but on drop the target is the "ghosted" element that's being dragged, not the actual target
[15:15:27] <bakers> ElGoorf: Submitting by default? Where is your submit() in this code?
[15:15:38] <ElGoorf> line 19
[15:15:57] <bakers> ElGoorf: Oh heh :) Why does it submit onload?
[15:15:58] <quuxman> there are hundreds of plugins under "Drag-and-drop" on the jquery website, but I can't find any that simply do the basics
[15:16:13] <GoGoGarrett> perhaps pass in $('#writemessage').submit(funciton(e){     e.preventDefault();  ....
[15:16:16] <ElGoorf> its not submitting on load
[15:16:34] <ElGoorf> or at least i dont think it should be
[15:16:52] <bakers> ElGoorf: So you load the form, and then in your callback preventDefault and give it a submit function?
[15:17:07] <ElGoorf> its the action i want to happen when it's submitted
[15:17:13] <bakers> ElGoorf: That looks like it should work, but I'd have to see it in jsfiddle maybe?
[15:18:42] <bakers> ElGoorf: Oh wait... you're giving #sendmessage a submit() function, not the actual form itself
[15:18:58] <bakers> Change line #19 to $("#myform").submit()...
[15:19:30] <ElGoorf> #writemessage is the name of the form
[15:19:34] <ElGoorf> id of the form*
[15:19:56] <bakers> ElGoorf: oh I thought #12 said #writemessage, my bad
[15:20:45] <bakers> ElGoorf: Is that submit function getting attached? That code looks good, I'm guessing that element isn't there, or for some reason it's not getting attached
[15:21:13] <ElGoorf> thats what im guessing, damn, is hould probably point out
[15:21:22] <KWhat_Work> if i call .button() on something is there a way to remove that later?  Can i call something like .button('remove') ?
[15:21:32] <ElGoorf> where you see load(/account/message);
[15:21:45] <ElGoorf> #writemessage is inside that file
[15:22:11] <ElGoorf> hence why i thought to use (load), so it applies after the forms been generated, does that make sense?
[15:22:18] <ElGoorf> load()*
[15:22:37] <bakers> ElGoorf: After you load it, can you do $("#writemessage") in firebug? Does jquery find the element?
[15:22:53] <bakers> ElGoorf: That should be fine
[15:23:56] <ElGoorf> where do i find it in firebug?
[15:24:51] <ElGoorf> i should probably download atcual firebug instead of using firebug lite in chrome
[15:28:14] <sodapop> if i am serving the same content through http and https, ajax calls on page accessed through https will be encrypted without modifying any code?
[15:29:08] <KWhat_Work> sodapop: yes
[15:29:35] <KWhat_Work> sodapop: as long as you dont specifically say http://
[15:30:04] <sodapop> where in $.ajax ?
[15:30:27] <KWhat_Work> the url
[15:30:43] <WilliamLH> How can I transform an XML with jquery (I'm receiving the xml as a response from .ajax)
[15:31:05] <KWhat_Work> datatype xml ?
[15:31:28] <ElGoorf> bakers, turns out nothing is happening at $("#writemessage").load(function(){
[15:31:28] <sodapop> what happens if add there https in a page served over http
[15:32:00] <KWhat_Work> it will make the ajax request over ssl
[15:32:17] <KWhat_Work> but the page content request is over normal http
[15:32:43] <WilliamLH> Yes, I set the dataType as XML
[15:33:18] <sodapop> so encryption wont work this way
[15:33:56] <John-Gresham> hi, is it possible to do something like $('#id').$('span') ?
[15:35:18] <bakers> John-Gresham: No... what are you trying to do?
[15:35:44] <bakers> John-Gresham: If you're trying to find the spans inside of #id do $("#id span")
[15:36:29] <KWhat_Work> sodapop: if you specify https it will be encrypted via ssl, if you do not explicitly state https and the fully qualified domain it will use the current pages protocol and fully qualified domain.
[15:36:48] <John-Gresham> bakers: I'd like to pass a jQuery object instead of a string to pass to $
[15:37:22] <bakers> John-Gresham: I'll need more information on what you want to do
[15:37:46] <bakers> John-Gresham: var item = $("#item");
[15:37:47] <John-Gresham> because the only solution i found to do so is to use the id as a string to add the sub selectors I need
[15:38:00] <bakers> John-Gresham: Then it's cached and you can do item.css() or item.click() or whatever
[15:38:51] <bakers> John-Gresham: I'm almost positive you can do it with a normal jquery selector. What are you trying to select
[15:39:03] <John-Gresham> bakers: going to pastebin, back with a paste :)
[15:41:36] <sodapop> KWhat_Work, i discussed yesterday here but i thought it's not possible without using iframe, so if i specify url:"https://mydomain/myfunction" in my $.ajax  and run it from http://mydomain/page.html it will encrypt
[15:42:07] <John-Gresham> bakers: arf, i can sum it up in on line : can I do jquery_object.somefunction('span').html() instead of $(the_id+' span').html() ?
[15:42:33] <JKarsrud1> find
[15:42:38] <JKarsrud1> ?find

[15:42:53] <John-Gresham> that's it ! thanks ! :)
[15:43:15] <ElGoorf> bakers, for future reference i fixed my issue by using ajax() instead of load(0
[15:43:28] <KWhat_Work> sodapop: it should unless thats going to trigger a cross domain issues.... i havnt actually tested it but it should be pretty easy to make sure using wireshark or tcpdump
[15:43:37] <JKarsrud1> np :)
[15:43:51] <JKarsrud1> That's the good deed for me today before I hop to bed ;)
[15:44:08] <niftylettuce> best plugin for image resizing/scaling?
[15:45:36] <niftylettuce> resizing/cropping*
[15:46:06] <coldhead> niftylettuce: http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop.html ?
[15:46:07] <sodapop> KWhat_Work, : it will cause Cross domain posting
[15:46:44] <sodapop> anyway thanks
[15:47:16] <draginx1> need a really good scrollbar plugin that allows me to customize the scrollbar and is pretty dynamic (meaning i can set the width and height myself onto an element and it'll know what to do)
[15:47:30] <KWhat_Work> sodapop: generally if your transferring sensitive data you probably want to do it all over https.  Its going to stop your coockie hijacking etc. I think there is an option for .ajax to allow cross site .
[15:49:55] <odyniec> niftylettuce: let me plug my own here: http://odyniec.net/projects/imgareaselect/
[15:52:03] <GoGoGarrett> That's pretty sweet man
[15:53:41] <niftylettuce> odyniec: hows it different than jCrop...?
[15:53:54] <niftylettuce> odyniec: I combined jCrop and another plugin when I built the FB app at http://profilepane.com
[15:54:01] <niftylettuce> (scroll down page to pic of lamborghini)
[15:54:20] <niftylettuce> it was really sh***y... took me like 4 hrs to build the entire app
[15:54:28] <stygyan> hello there
[15:55:34] <odyniec> niftylettuce: I don't know that much about Jcrop :) just two implementations of similar functionality
[15:57:51] <WilliamLH> How can I transform an XML response based off an XSL file with jQuery?
[15:59:43] <j_wright> new XSLTProcessor
[16:00:35] <WilliamLH> Is that a plugin?
[16:02:40] <j_wright> no, part of most browsers, i think in IE you have to do something else afair
[16:11:35] <abjorn> hey guysssssssssssssssss
[16:11:53] <abjorn> so apparently like 20% calling in for support at hostgator think they're gonna make the next facebook
[16:30:32] <versatiletech> abjorn: ?? You work for them?
[16:30:49] <abjorn> yeah
[16:30:51] <abjorn> well, in training
[16:30:53] <abjorn> just got hired
[16:32:46] <MrHacks> Hello #jquery. I recently figured out how to change pages using the arrow keys like Tumblr does.  However, I am interested in adding a Konami Code (up up down down left right left right b a start(er, enter)) to do something special.  Jquery seems to eliminate the need to event attachments like regular javascript. If I use event.which (which I assume is proper jquery) , how do I get my program to recognize a series of arrow/key commands?
[16:34:42] <abjorn> brb
[16:34:44] <quuxman> ok, now I have a real problem: Firefox's builtin drag-and-drop features is interfeering with jquery-ui's draggable feature
[16:34:53] <MaxMeents> considering that you should try to change classes rather than use .css(), what do you do when you need to change size and padding of many elments on your page dynamically?  do you make the new style using something like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1720320/how-to-dynamically-create-css-class-in-javascript-and-apply or do you just use .css() ?
[16:37:27] <zeropx> if I have $('ul li') and I want to move the last LI to the top, how would I go about doing that?
[16:40:10] <skamikaze> zeropx: var list = $("ul"); $list.prepend( $list.children("li").last());
[16:42:19] <zeropx> skamikaze: thanks, ill try that out
[16:45:37] <blindMoe> skamikaze: I think it has to be: var list = $("ul"); $(list).prepend( $(list).children("li").last());
[16:46:19] <skamikaze> blindMoe: no
[16:46:41] <skamikaze> why cache the list node and don't use it then? besides $(list) doesn't make sense - sry
[16:46:52] <blindMoe> doesn't work w/o it
[16:47:11] <blindMoe> http://jsfiddle.net/gbUZE/
[16:47:40] <blindMoe> you have to at least take the $ off of the front of $list
[16:47:59] <no5thdimension> hey guys. im trying to make an image spin on hover, but I can't find a way of doing it without using 3 or more plugins. ridiculous! isn't there just one 'animate' command that can do this?
[16:48:12] <skamikaze> blindMoe: http://jsfiddle.net/gbUZE/1/
[16:48:28] <blindMoe> skamikaze: yeap.. can't have $list .. not proper syntax
[16:48:44] <skamikaze> ???
[16:49:06] <blindMoe> read the first one that was pasted.. it has $list twice.. doesn't work
[16:49:19] <blindMoe> var list = $("ul"); $list.prepend( $list.children("li").last());
[16:49:31] <blindMoe> doesn't matter.. was just trying to help
[16:49:40] <skamikaze> ah ok - had a typo
[16:50:04] <no5thdimension> spin on hover? anyone?
[16:50:06] <skamikaze> sry for that - eating gulasz :P
[16:50:15] <quuxman> oh my. jquery-ui detects what you dropped on by iterating through all droppable elements and checking for intersection
[16:50:23] <quuxman> I guess that's the correct way to do it
[16:52:56] <zeropx> thanks guys, the adjust version worked great.
[16:54:11] <Dreamer3> hmmm
[16:54:16] <Dreamer3> can fadeIn not be used with opacity?
[16:54:23] <Dreamer3> want to fade to 50% and then fade back to 100%
[16:55:17] <zeropx> Dreamer3: seems like you could do better with Animate instead?
[16:55:19] <zeropx> just a thought
[16:56:42] <Dreamer3> maybe
[16:57:24] <tactical2> hi
[16:59:20] <solidus-river> hey all, i have a statment, var jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj)
[16:59:28] <solidus-river> yet everything after it claims it is not initiated
[16:59:36] <zeropx> thanks guys, im out.
[17:00:33] <ryanneufeld> just found this: http://www.alfajango.com/blog/the-difference-between-jquerys-bind-live-and-delegate/
[17:02:06] <solidus-river> is it valid to do

[17:18:54] <steven> Hi all!
[17:18:55] <KWhat_Work> or something to that effect
[17:19:09] <KWhat_Work> isnt anyone here steven
[17:19:28] <steven> eh
[17:19:37] <steven> Maybe you can help
[17:19:45] <steven> I have this virtual keyboard: http://adtiki.tk/register.php
[17:19:52] <KWhat_Work> maybe, but only if you help me ;)
[17:20:35] <KWhat_Work> nice keyboard
[17:21:14] <steven> I'm trying to get the keyboard to bind to the form field when the user selects it...... but the code's not working. The function seems to be running, but it's not defining the variable (or something)
[17:21:44] <steven> Here's the JS: http://adtiki.tk/themes/adtiki/javascript/keyboard.js
[17:21:57] <KWhat_Work> hehehe is not defined
[17:22:44] <steven> Oops, I added that to make sure the function was firing
[17:22:55] <steven> There
[17:22:57] <KWhat_Work> console.log works better ;)
[17:23:48] <KWhat_Work> steven: whats the $ for and write is not in the scope of the keyboard click functino
[17:23:55] <KWhat_Work> $write
[17:24:53] <steven> IDK, that's just what the variable was. I'm trying to modify the code from a Nettuts+ tutorial: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/creating-a-keyboard-with-css-and-jquery/
[17:25:23] <steven> What do you mean by it's not in the scope?
[17:26:19] <KWhat_Work> your assigning it in the focus listener but that variable is only defined inside of that function.  It should be above that
[17:27:12] <KWhat_Work> var $write = document[formName][formField];
[17:27:19] <KWhat_Work> dont but var in front
[17:29:22] <steven> YES!! For some reason, that worked! Thanks!
[17:29:30] <KWhat_Work> its a scope issue
[17:29:31] <RobW> how do I trigger a click on acc_title that has html of "c" ? http://pastebin.com/Fr0BLEi6
[17:29:41] <KWhat_Work> !scope
[17:32:28] <steven> What do you mean by triggering "a click"?
[17:32:48] <steven> Do you want to trigger an event when the user clicks something?
[17:33:38] <RobW> I want that 3rd bar
[17:33:41] <RobW> that has the same clas.
[17:33:43] <RobW> class*
[17:33:54] <RobW> tried: $("#accordion1 .acc_title:eq(2)").trigger("click");
[17:34:53] <steven> $('#accordion1 .acc_title:eq(2)').click(function() { ???
[17:35:04] <RobW> no i want to trigger the click on the 3rd .acc_title
[17:35:12] <steven> OH
[17:35:16] <steven> I don't believe you can "click" something in JS.....
[17:35:47] <odyniec> RobW: the id in your HTML is "accodion1"
[17:36:08] <steven> Maybe this will help? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/155188/trigger-button-click-with-javascript-on-enter-key-in-text-box
[17:36:20] <RobW> ...
[17:36:33] <RobW> steven: you can trigger clicks in jquery
[17:36:33] <steven> Oh, that could also be the problem....
[17:36:45] <steven> I see that now....
[17:36:47] <RobW> odyniec: that's the parent ID, but I want the 3rd div with class .acc_title
[17:36:59] <odyniec> RobW: I mean there seems to be a typo
[17:37:08] <steven> You have a typo in the DIV id
[17:37:24] <steven> that'll throw the whole thing off
[17:37:52] <RobW> odyniec: oh..
[17:38:19] <RobW> designers can't spell for shit apparently
[17:38:30] <RobW> that was the problem, thank s;)
[17:38:33] <steven> We're all human!
[17:38:41] <steven> Glad you got it working
[17:39:23] <quuxman> If I want to make an <a> element draggable with jquery, how do I disable the browser's default behavior?
[17:39:39] <quuxman> (or element containing an <a> or <img>)
[17:39:50] <RobW> quuxman: return false in the function or event.preventDefault()
[17:40:32] <RobW> example.. $("#id").draggable(); $("#id").click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); /* OR */ return false; });
[17:40:49] <RobW> or.. $("#id").click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); /* OR */ return false; }).draggable(); perhaps
[17:42:18] <odyniec> quuxman: there are also some browsers-specific things to consider, for example in MSIE you often need to set the "unselectable" attribute, so that your dragging does not result in text being selected
[18:04:27] <WilliamLH> I used XSLTProcessor to generate some transformed text that I can not seem to insert into my document.  What might I be doing wrong?
[18:06:05] <solidus-river> how do i change the origin of an ajax request using jquery?
[18:06:23] <solidus-river> i'm getting an access problem
[18:06:58] <coldhead> solidus-river: host the file at another location
[18:08:11] <balr0g> hello guys, playing with some jquery sliders, i found jQuery Cycle Plugin ( http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/ ), do anyone have ever used it? i cant achieve to use the "fit" option... that fit option is the most important option i need to use... can someone help me please?
[18:09:43] <coldhead> lots of people have used it, balr0g, it's very popylar
[18:09:49] <coldhead> popular*
[18:09:57] <coldhead> do you have a link to your broken demo?
[18:10:58] <balr0g> coldhead, nop... i have tried fit with 0, 1, true, false values... also combined with height and width options witn auto and null values ...
[18:11:09] <balr0g> coldhead, must i set a jsfiddle example?
[18:11:18] <solidus-river> i dont get it, i cant host the file at another location
[18:11:26] <cobalt237> Can I do a hide() call on an anchor inside an .each() block?  Firebug says there is no hide function
[18:12:23] <ajpiano> cobalt237 $(this)
[18:12:32] <ajpiano> this is a dom element not a jquery object inside of an each loop
[18:12:39] <ajpiano> solidus-riverm, you can't do cross domain ajax
[18:12:54] <ajpiano> if you could programmatically override the domain of a request using javascript that wouldn't work very well now would it
[18:13:12] <ajpiano> (you can actually set the domain if you're trying to make requests on the same subdomain, fyi)
[18:13:23] <coldhead> balr0g: a working demo is always most helpful
[18:13:28] <cobalt237> ajpiano: Oh, that was incredibly simple.  Thanks.
[18:13:35] <balr0g> coldhead, ok give a minute...
[18:15:27] <solidus-river> where is the acces-Control-Allow-origin header defined
[18:16:44] <ajpiano> you can set headers on the ajax request in the beforeSend calback, i believe
[18:18:28] <ajpiano> but that's a response header, it would have to be set by the server
[18:18:38] <ajpiano> ?sop workaround

[18:24:31] <luchenbill> hello, I have 3 images, and I would like to make a simple fade out and fade in, any ideas on how to start this?
[18:24:32] <balr0g> coldhead, look: http://jsfiddle.net/gSwGf/3/ i dont seem to running the Cycle plugin...
[18:24:53] <balr0g> it*
[18:28:15] <coldhead> balr0g: http://jsfiddle.net/gSwGf/4/
[18:28:27] <coldhead> had to include jQuery and cycle on the left
[18:28:43] <coldhead> these images are pretty fucked up
[18:29:15] <balr0g> coldhead, sorry, they are imegaes on bad things...
[18:29:23] <coldhead> i see :)
[18:29:29] <ch3mical> Could someone help me figure out this JSONtoXML parser? http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/AZgks/4/
[18:31:16] <balr0g> coldhead, ok, but my problem is: dont get the fit option to work... its supposed to fit the container (232x232) as said here: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/options.html
[18:31:27] <cobalt237> Is $('#filter_input').text() the correct way to pull the text out of a input box id'd as 'filter_input'?
[18:32:48] <polyrhythmic> ?source extend
[18:32:48] <bot-t1> Line#314 - "jQuery.extend = jQuery.fn.extend = function() {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#314
[18:32:54] <polyrhythmic> ty bot
[18:33:20] <polyrhythmic> no more bot-t.com D: I must have not tried that in a while
[18:33:39] <coldhead> balr0g: http://jsfiddle.net/gSwGf/6/
[18:33:46] <coldhead> that uses overflow:hidden
[18:33:53] <coldhead> i guess you want more than that
[18:38:48] <balr0g> coldhead, i need to fit to the container... Cycle plugin say it has that capability... in the example you show it is not fitting... what option beside fit must i set on the Cycle execution?
[18:39:17] <coldhead> i am reading the cycle source for you right now
[18:39:38] <coldhead> you can read along! https://github.com/malsup/cycle/blob/master/jquery.cycle.all.js
[18:40:00] <balr0g> coldhead, ok, tks, i just see the documentation on the main page: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/
[18:40:05] <balr0g> coldhead, also reading sir
[18:41:37] <mattp_> does css applied with style="foo:bar;" not get read by $().css('foo');
[18:41:39] <mattp_> ?
[18:42:20] <coldhead> balr0g: you are telling cycle to fit your images to the container, right? then you are telling cycle the container's size is "auto"
[18:42:28] <coldhead> TOO MUCH AUTO
[18:42:35] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/gSwGf/7/
[18:46:10] <balr0g> coldhead, what yu mean with too much auto... what auto does?
[18:47:22] <coldhead> auto says "resize to fit the content"
[18:47:44] <coldhead> so it doesn't know what size to resize the slides to
[18:48:11] <coldhead> you're saying "ensure the images fit within the container, but also, let the container resize to fit the images"
[18:48:17] <coldhead> you can't have it both ways
[18:50:44] <coldhead> CAPICHE?
[18:52:11] <balr0g> coldhead, yes if i use fit on true and height on auto it will be confused, right?
[18:53:09] <coldhead> yes
[18:53:12] <balr0g> coldhead, i dont know what size the container will be... im using percents... i guess i can set height/width options of the cycle obkect later using JS, isnt?
[18:53:15] <coldhead> and you should be confused too
[18:53:33] <coldhead> balr0g: what happens if you don't set width and height in JS?
[18:53:36] <coldhead> just in the CSS?
[18:54:17] <balr0g> coldhead, that was my first attempt... it will resize to the original content (image) size
[18:55:27] <coldhead> i see
[18:55:58] <balr0g> coldhead, what do you say about my percent size issue? can it be setted (the cycle options) later using JS, right?
[18:56:08] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/gSwGf/14/
[18:56:23] <coldhead> that code lets you set it in the CSS
[18:56:28] <coldhead> as percentages or whatever
[18:58:10] <balr0g> coldhead, ok, i will try it on the real page... i think if i get trouble, i always can access the cycle object to set options...
[18:58:35] <coldhead> good luck, babe
[18:58:49] <balr0g> coldhead, tks pal

[19:15:07] <Madonnaboy> So during Anthony Weiner's think tank on ways to salvage his political career, I suggested starting a minority group for people that have affairs.
[19:16:21] <_Sorensen> you realize our founding fathers would be in that group
[19:16:26] <_Sorensen> =\
[19:16:46] <Madonnaboy> ya
[19:16:58] <_Sorensen> 'minority' is hardly correct
[19:17:05] <Madonnaboy> Thomas Jefferson used to have hot sex with Andrew Jackson.
[19:17:09] <_Sorensen> maybe the 'people who got caught' minority
[19:17:15] <Madonnaboy> ya
[19:17:17] <_Sorensen> no, just all of his slaves
[19:17:31] <_Sorensen> of whom he never freed
[19:18:21] <_Sorensen> the only difference between today and 'yesterday' is that we make way more of a deal out of it
[19:19:55] <Madonnaboy> Anyone here in for having Madonna as Secretary-General of the U.N.?
[19:29:21] <abjorn> Madonnaboy: Hot 80s Madonna? Yes.
[19:29:38] <abjorn> But that would require time travel.
[19:30:00] <frustratedcoder> any chance anyone has any idea at all as to when the themeroller will work again or some way to work around it? I'm already out $$$
[19:30:14] <Madonnaboy> abjorn: I would still do her.
[19:31:04] <abjorn> nah i wouldn't

[19:43:26] <hobs> and what are you looking at
[19:43:36] <coldhead> i don't have any tablet yet
[19:43:42] <coldhead> but the newish acer iconia
[19:43:49] <coldhead> pretty affordable, usb, hdmi
[19:43:53] <coldhead> what's not to love
[19:43:57] <hobs> oh new as in just new
[19:44:04] <hobs> well the brand basically
[19:44:10] <hobs> acer is my mind isnt that reliable
[19:44:10] <coldhead> right
[19:44:18] <hobs> but otherwise that sounds good
[19:44:21] <coldhead> but isn't that brand racism?
[19:44:22] <hobs> what is the sizing
[19:44:24] <hobs> yes
[19:44:28] <coldhead> SOME gypsies are thieves
[19:44:31] <hobs> most
[19:44:35] <hobs> I know them
[19:44:36] <coldhead> lol
[19:44:45] <coldhead> well that's a bad example
[19:44:49] <hobs> yep
[19:44:49] <coldhead> all gypsies are thieves
[19:44:54] <hobs> exactly
[19:44:59] <hobs> dont use politicans either
[19:45:01] <coldhead> SOME bulgarians are gypsies
[19:45:13] <hobs> thats a better example
[19:45:21] <hobs> the other bulgarians are dead
[19:45:37] <coldhead> killed by gypsies, no doubt
[19:45:59] <coldhead> i suppose i will wait for sales and bad reviews
[19:46:31] <hobs> yeah I rarely get bitten by the preorder bug unless it was starcraft 2
[19:48:20] <dmitryE> has anyone been able to successfully use a custom html tag selector with jQuery 1.6.1? For example: $("fb\\:like).length across IE 7/8/9 ? I can get it to work in IE7 with $("like") but that fails IE8/9 and the other examples fails to result in any matches with IE7.
[19:50:24] <Madonnaboy> dmitryE: Custom tags are the spawn of Satan Himself.
[19:53:43] <dmitryE> Yes... and I'd like to spread evil .... hence "the darkside shall consume you". But... if evil existed in the world, how would you filter/select for it? :)
[19:54:38] <Madonnaboy> lol
[19:55:07] <Madonnaboy> If you give it an id, is jquery able to select it/
[19:55:11] <Madonnaboy> @ dmitryE
[19:56:42] <dmitryE> haven't tried w/ ID or Class - since something like <fb:like> is external to me and doesn't have an ID/Class I may not be able to. But I will try that with a test harness to see if that even works across all browsers.
[19:57:22] <Madonnaboy> I'd be interested in knowing if that works
[19:57:27] <Madonnaboy> hmm
[19:57:57] <coldhead> i'd be inclined to ask in #facebook, it's kind of their problem
[19:58:13] <vladikoff> woah there's a facebook channel
[19:58:43] <Madonnaboy> vladikoff: I met Zuckerberg there in like 2008
[19:58:52] <Madonnaboy> he was trolling lol
[19:59:53] <dmitryE> lol
[20:00:09] <dmitryE> i'm curious about the custom tags because it's not just FB, I'm using FB as an example. I
[20:00:26] <dmitryE> I have a couple of vendors now that sent me widgets to integrate that use custom tags.
[20:01:26] <Madonnaboy> Let us know how select by id or class works
[20:03:43] <dmitryE> trying it now.. i'll get back to you as soon as it's tested
[20:13:10] <dmitryE> ok, I have a test harness and results: http://jsfiddle.net/9v35s/
[20:13:16] <dmitryE> both ID and class work
[20:13:32] <dmitryE> across all IE browsers and Chrome (so far the ones I've tested with)
[20:18:56] <KWhat_Mobile> how does _destroy get called on a widget?
[20:22:21] <KWhat_Mobile> or am i suppose to create a destroy method not a _destroy method?
[20:23:22] <ajpiano> destroy not _destroy
[20:23:26] <ajpiano> ftw
[20:23:42] <KWhat_Mobile> all the overrides suppose to be not _ like setOptions etc?
[20:24:10] <ajpiano> _ denotes private vs public
[20:24:18] <ajpiano> destroy is meant to be public
[20:24:24] <ajpiano> so you have to provide public
[20:24:28] <KWhat_Mobile> yah, think i need to use the meodes outline in http://jqueryui.com/docs/Developer_Guide#The_widget_factory
[20:24:39] <ryanneufeld1> by convention only you can still access it publicly :P
[20:24:44] <KWhat_Mobile> do i need to call up to the .widget or is that handled
[20:25:10] <KWhat_Mobile> what about create / distroy
[20:25:17] <KWhat_Mobile> create / init *
[20:25:24] <ajpiano> you have to call the destroy from the base
[20:25:28] <ajpiano>        $.Widget.prototype.destroy.apply(this, arguments); // default destroy
[20:26:43] <ryanneufeld1> .seen temp01
[20:26:44] <hsbot> temp01 was seen 13 hours, 46 minutes and 19 seconds ago, joining #html5
[20:30:28] <KWhat_Mobile> so $.Widget.prototype.destroy.apply(this, arguments); is how i should be destroying my widget ?
[20:30:48] <ajpiano> as part of your own destroy method
[20:30:54] <ajpiano> where you would do any other manual destruction you need
[20:31:11] <ajpiano> that step won't be necessary in ui 1.9
[20:31:18] <KWhat_Mobile> im using 1.9
[20:31:21] <KWhat_Mobile> m5
[20:31:30] <ajpiano> hm
[20:31:31] <KWhat_Mobile> so i just need to make my destroy metod public
[20:31:34] <ajpiano> ya
[20:31:43] <KWhat_Mobile> what about _create and _init
[20:31:51] <ajpiano> those stay _
[20:32:21] <KWhat_Mobile> k and _setOption should be options
[20:33:04] <KWhat_Mobile> also what is defaultElement
[20:33:15] <KWhat_Mobile> or do i need not mess with that
[20:33:39] <ajpiano> defaultElement is the element it's designed to work for in the base case
[20:33:44] <ajpiano> usually useful for unit testing
[20:38:34] <KWhat_Mobile> ajpiano: and _setOption should be options?
[20:39:51] <ajpiano> no, i believe you still use _setOptions - that's where you actually respond to the change
[20:39:56] <ajpiano> options is for setting
[20:58:37] <KWhat_Mobile> there no change listener?
[20:58:44] <KWhat_Mobile> change event*
[20:59:16] <balr0g> i couldn't find a image slider jquery plugin to solve all my needs: fit image, transition effects like rain/squares, accept caption/text on images and customize (hide/modify) controls/nav/thumbnails, what a sadness
[21:00:20] <djQuery> wazzup
[21:00:43] <KWhat_Mobile> balr0g: you could write your own ;)
[21:00:44] <iszak> notin
[21:01:52] <balr0g> KWhat_Mobile, lol, could be, but thats not my core bussiness
[21:03:04] <ryanneufeld1> djQuery: wassaaappp!!
[21:03:30] <djQuery> frigginnn jquery.tmplItem
[21:05:35] <djQuery> having problems saving data back to the data from a template
[21:06:39] <ryanneufeld1> hmm
[21:06:43] <ryanneufeld1> not that familiar with that
[21:07:47] <djQuery> ?tell ryanneufeld1  didnt mean to scare you off
[21:07:47] <bot-t1> djQuery, Okay.
[21:10:53] <KWhat_Mobile> does jquery not have an onchange event listener?
[21:11:01] <djQuery> ?change
[21:11:02] <bot-t1> .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[21:11:09] <wookiehangover> that'll do
[21:11:27] <KWhat_Mobile> binding to change doesnt like me
[21:11:35] <wookiehangover> ?p
[21:11:36] <bot-t1> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[21:11:36] <djQuery> KWhat_Mobile: jsut about anything that has "on" infront of it just drop the on
[21:13:01] * balr0g brb.
[21:13:15] <djQuery> $('input').bind('change', function(){ console.log(this.value); });  $('form').delegate(':input', 'change', function(){   console.log(this.value); });
[21:13:26] <djQuery> KWhat_Mobile: take your pick
[21:13:57] <wookiehangover> or just plain old $('select').change(function(e){ // do stuff });
[21:15:19] <KWhat_Mobile> mmm yah trying the bind, doesnt seem to fire ....
[21:17:44] <KWhat_Mobile> yah blur works change does not O_o
[21:21:13] <KWhat_Mobile> mmm strange djQuery does that change fire on blur ?
[21:25:29] <djQuery> ?prepend
[21:25:29] <bot-t1> .prepend(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[21:28:12] <djQuery> hmmm y isnt this working Â $log.prepend($(this).val()Â +Â '<br />');
[21:28:22] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/SSVmq/1/
[21:29:30] <djQuery> wookiehangover: what stupid thing did I do? ^^^^
[21:30:45] <wookiehangover> djQuery: #logger
[21:31:29] <djQuery> knew it was somethin stupid
[21:32:31] <djQuery> hmmm in chrome if you type text into a <input type="number" /> then tab off it clears the data but still triggers the change
[21:35:16] <wookiehangover> so what seems to be happening is that it triggers the change since the value is set to nil
[21:35:48] <djQuery> but it started nill changed to invalid and changed to nill
[21:36:06] <djQuery> thought the change should be seen by the javascript layer as it was invalid
[21:36:19] <djQuery> should not
[21:36:50] <djQuery> well it shouldnt have ever let me type non numeric in the first place but oh well
[21:37:26] <wookiehangover> ya, fuck input type="number"
[21:38:51] <djQuery> any good with templates? the tmplItem does not seem to be updating the original data item.  http://jsbin.com/aboma3/15/edit
[21:39:19] <djQuery> all the way at the bottom
[21:40:28] <djQuery> well darn maybe it is and I am not reseting the screen correctly
[21:41:38] <djQuery> ?empty
[21:41:38] <bot-t1> .empty(): Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[21:42:30] <wookiehangover> i wish jsbin/fiddle had line numbers
[21:42:39] <djQuery> same
[21:42:58] <djQuery> at least jsbin when it gives an error you can click on the error and it will go to the line
[21:44:49] <wookiehangover> I really just want to lazyweb vim bindings into one of them
[21:45:37] <bobbobbins> hey, im trying to use dataTable and pull in some ajax data, but i can't seem to get it working...can someone look at my code and tell me what im doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/LsTFx/
[22:10:32] <pomke> Has anyone got an example of a ui sortable where the items in a list are also drop targets? ie: nested sortables?
[22:12:01] <pomke> sorry nvm
[22:20:46] <TuRnc04tZ> hey guys, quick question
[22:21:13] <TuRnc04tZ> is there a plugin for jquery or a function that basically creates an overlay around an element when you do a intent hover or just hover like this: http://www.russruffino.com/
[22:21:41] <TuRnc04tZ> i looked around the source of the site but nothing really stood out
[22:23:12] <TuRnc04tZ> anyone?
[22:23:33] <balr0g> TuRnc04tZ, cant be that achieved using JS+CSS ?
[22:23:53] <TuRnc04tZ> i know how to do intenthover
[22:24:12] <TuRnc04tZ> but i wanted to know if there was already a function that did the overlay around the element
[22:24:14] <TuRnc04tZ> being hovered on
[22:24:41] <TuRnc04tZ> i guess you can use jquery to create an overlay and give the element a higher z-index
[22:32:08] <quuxman> <rant>Why does JavaScript have to have ONE dynamically scoped variable 'this' while everything else is lexically scoped?
[22:33:11] <iszak> quuxman, magic? ask ##javascript
[22:33:45] <quuxman> I actually make a point to never use 'this' in my own code
[22:34:06] <iszak> sometimes you need to.
[22:34:16] <quuxman> iszak: only when dealing with other code, like jquery
[22:34:54] <quuxman> iszak: for constructors I say: function Foo() { var self = {}; ...; return self }
[22:35:39] <iszak> well, good luck with that.
[22:36:03] <Cork> quuxman: thats not a constructor though
[22:36:31] <quuxman> Cork: right. I don't use the .constructor property, or .prototype :-|
[22:36:46] <Cork> no i mean its just a function that returns an object
[22:36:58] <quuxman> it constructs an object
[22:37:05] <Cork> function Foo() { this.value = test; }; var test = new Foo();
[22:37:07] <Cork> is a constructor
[22:37:15] <Cork> *function Foo() { this.value = 'test'; }; var test = new Foo();
[22:37:23] <quuxman> I never use 'new'
[22:37:32] <Cork> you don't return a value from a constructor
[22:37:43] <Cork> quuxman: if you don't then its just a function
[22:37:53] <Cork> not a constructor
[22:39:16] <Cork> quuxman: you can wrap the constructor in a helper so you don't have to use new
[22:39:25] <Cork> but new has to be called somewhere to get a constructor
[22:39:30] <iszak> Cork++
[22:40:30] <symaxian> Should jQuery requests be cached if used a few times? Or is the delay negligible
[22:40:34] <Cork> function Foo() { this.value = 'test'; }; function foo() { return new Foo(); }; var test = foo();
[22:41:05] <symaxian> Or selections I should call them
[22:41:28] <quuxman> I'm pretty familiar with Javascript's object system, I just think it's weird enough that I ignore most of it
[22:41:44] <Cork> symaxian: depends a little, if your selecting on pure id's then it doesn't matter
[22:41:50] <Cork> symaxian: of not, then ya, cache
[22:42:06] <symaxian> Yeah Its all id's
[22:42:40] <Cork> quuxman: ya, your using lose object, and functions returning them. Rhats fine, but call them for what they are
[22:42:52] <Cork> Raths==Thats
[22:43:53] <quuxman> ah, that's called 'loose objects'?
[22:44:04] <symaxian> Is it bad practice to put an assignment as a function argument to save space       myFunc(data = 4);      vs     data = 4; myFunc(4)
[22:44:42] <Cork> quuxman: no it doesn't have a real name as far as i know, var self = {}; initialize an object
[22:45:06] <Cork> quuxman: but it doesn't have a relation to anything, and it doesn't have a custom constructor
[22:45:24] <Cork> (uses the Object default constructor)
[22:45:53] <quuxman> Cork: yeah, I wish JavaScript was actually CoffeeScript :)
[22:46:26] <Cork> quuxman: if you want to create objects that have private data, and share members you need constructors and prototype
[22:46:58] <quuxman> Cork: oh interesting. That use case had not occurred to me
[22:47:02] <Cork> quuxman: the best part with prototype is that it reduces memory consumtion
[22:47:32] <Cork> and makse the code faster as it doesn't have to add everything to the object everytime you create one
[22:47:37] <Cork> *makes
[22:48:02] <Cork> (prototype is inherited, so its added once, used many)
[22:49:02] <quuxman> Never been really comfortable with the prototype thing :-P
[22:49:39] <Cork> quuxman: its basically the same as cpp friend functions
[22:49:50] <quuxman> thanks for pointing out that you can share properties between an object and its prototype and have them be private to other objects
[22:50:03] <quuxman> never used C++
[22:50:51] <Cork> quuxman: no prototype can't get access to private members
[22:51:10] <Cork> quuxman: only public members, can be accessed in prototype functions
[22:51:49] <Cork> (as private members is just variables defined in the constructor scope)
[22:52:25] <quuxman> right... what did you mean by "f you want to create objects that have private data, and share members you need constructors and prototype"
[22:53:13] <Cork> quuxman: constructors is needed to have private members
[22:53:37] <Cork> quuxman: prototype is needed to be able to share members between objects
[22:53:55] <quuxman> why not just use lexical closures for private members?
[22:55:28] <quuxman> my method for sharing members between objects is to pass a reference of a 'parent' object to a constructor
[22:55:31] <Cork> quuxman: heh well ok, if you don't use prototype you can use a function instead of a constructor
[22:55:37] <quuxman> er, "constructor" I should write
[22:55:39] <Cork> but its basically the same thing
[22:56:11] <Cork> quuxman: but private members IS lexical scope
[22:56:31] <quuxman> I'm not understanding the relation of the 'new' keyword to private members
[22:56:47] <quuxman> 'new' just magicks a new 'this' in to scope
[22:57:36] <Cork> quuxman: and it gives you something to attach prototype too
[22:57:45] <Cork> *to
[22:58:28] <Cork> quuxman: if you want to share members bewteen objects you create prototype is needed
[22:58:41] <quuxman> Cork: yeah
[22:58:49] <Cork> quuxman: if you want to use prototype to share members you need to use a constructor to be able to create private members
[22:59:11] <Cork> quuxman: if you don't want prototype, constructors doens't really give anything
[22:59:21] <hamdan> anyone can help me to redesign my template ???
[22:59:39] <Cork> quuxman: but in biger apps, you want those to reduce memory use
[23:18:59] <juha___> http://juvo.se/j6kn hahha so true
[23:21:08] <jovrtn> haha
[23:33:48] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[23:37:34] <Evelynn> I have table of input fields with datepickers, now if i modify this table with JS, and call .datepicker() on fields again, datepickers get lost (they do not show anymore) any info what could be wrong ?
[23:39:29] <wkmanire> Evelynn: Hmm, would you mind trying this? Call destroy on the old datepickers, then modify the table, then call datepicker again the way you did initially.
[23:41:12] <wkmanire> Evelynn: Destroy is a jquery-ui WidgetFactory method which should cleanly remove the old datepickers from the DOM before you set the new ones up on the modified table.
[23:41:24] <wkmanire> Well from the DOM and from memory.
[23:49:17] <Evelynn> wkmanire: thanks for info, but calling destroy seem to brake table modification
[23:49:39] <wkmanire> Evelynn: Would you mind setting up a js fiddle of your code?
[23:53:14] <Evelynn> wkmanire: $('input[id*="textDeliveryDate"]').each(function() { $(this).datepicker("destroy"); }); then $get(ajax...) that modifies and $('input[id*="textDeliveryDate"]').each(function() { $(this).datepicker(); });
