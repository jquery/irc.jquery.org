[00:02:41] <miCSu> Elirips: yes
[00:03:10] <miCSu> you can also get the index by using $.each(myArray, function(index,value) {
[00:09:29] <Elirips> miCSu: thank you. Yes, I'm using that syntax - I just wasn't sure if its only randomness that it iterates the array in the same way the array is sorted.
[00:11:57] <introspectr3> https://dpaste.de/ocByT/ This was working until I switched to a <table>, now when a user changes the select the data seems to be added above the table rather than replacing record_val_container contents. can anyone please help?
[00:13:21] <ryankask> has anyone used jqureyui with bootstrap?
[00:13:50] <ryankask> I'm trying to embed a form in an accordion and tab and it's not functioning
[00:13:57] <doug65536> introspectr3: that's odd. you have a div where a tr is expected
[00:14:18] <doug65536> introspectr3: at line 27, shouldn't the div be inside the tr?
[00:14:45] <doug65536> introspectr3: and inside the td for that matter
[00:15:00] <miCSu> Elirips: sorry, I was mistaken.
[00:15:32] <doug65536> introspectr3: perhaps an id on the tr, then insertBefore of a row would be more appropriate
[00:15:38] <introspectr3> doub65536, i just need a container to be able to dynamically add rows into depending on the selection choice. I don't believe that is a problem is it?
[00:15:39] <miCSu> Elirips: if you set the array with indexes like a = {4:'first',1:'second',34:'third'} it sorts it by indexes
[00:16:04] <introspectr3> ahh is there an insertAfter per chance?
[00:16:06] <doug65536> introspectr3: I didn't thing anything except a tr was a valid child for a table
[00:16:21] <doug65536> introspectr3: yes
[00:16:41] <introspectr3> ty doug65536, insertAfter is a much better solution lol. that div is quite ugly as is isn't it
[00:17:36] <doug65536> introspectr3: I'm surprised it worked at all :)
[00:31:56] <Elirips> miCSu: before I go into the $.each I have a myArray.sort(function(a, b,) { ... });
[00:32:32] <MrS1lentcz> hello, i have troubles with selectors. i have this part of html: "<tbody data-toggle="modal" href="#projectTeam">" and this selector is ok: $('#timeLocation_fieldset tbody') but with this $('#timeLocation_fieldset tbody[data-toggle="modal"]') i had not found anything. why, please?
[00:38:32] <MrS1lentcz> is here someone? :/
[00:39:01] <doug65536> introspectr3: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/YurEf/
[00:39:44] <introspectr3> thank you :p
[00:40:19] <xec> MrS1lentcz: looks fine to me, except I didn't think <tbody> had a "href" attribute
[00:43:23] <MrS1lentcz> xec: attributes are chooseable in html5 ;) it sees the tbody is not clickable or what?...
[00:43:43] <xec> MrS1lentcz: where on earth did you get that from
[00:44:06] <xec> MrS1lentcz: the only "choosable" attributes are prefixed with "data-"
[00:45:58] <xec> MrS1lentcz: anyway, the selector should work fine http://jsfiddle.net/ah3xD/
[00:48:58] <MrS1lentcz> xec: not me. i have rewrited as <tbody id="xxx"> and still not works if i have it catched on click event, but table does.
[00:49:27] <xec> what does "catched on click event" mean, what are you really doing? can you make a demo?
[00:51:06] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: are you sure tbody is a child to timeLocation_fieldset ?
[00:51:30] <MrS1lentcz> xex: Cork http://jsfiddle.net/ah3xD/1/
[00:51:42] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: the same works on table, not tbody
[00:52:16] <xec> MrS1lentcz: that seems to work fine, my console shows "do something" when clicking "test"
[00:52:52] <MrS1lentcz> xec: mmmm
[00:53:25] <MrS1lentcz> xec: maybe is something wrong if i loading this content dynamically...
[00:53:30] <xec> MrS1lentcz: are you 100% sure that the  $('#timeLocation_fieldset tbody') selector works in your code?
[00:53:31] <MrS1lentcz> with ajax
[00:53:57] <MrS1lentcz> xec: yeah, i was trying in browser dev console
[00:54:03] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: try $('#timeLocation_fieldset').on('click', 'tbody[data-toggle="modal"]', function() {})
[00:54:22] <Cork> if the table isn't loaded dynamically that is
[00:54:31] <xec> MrS1lentcz: and that's where you tested with the attribute selector too?
[00:54:55] <xec> Cork: I put the ID on the table, i have a feeling it's really on a <fieldset> ;)
[00:55:08] <Cork> ah
[00:55:11] <Cork> ya
[00:55:46] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier mmmm
[00:55:55] <Cork> mmmm??
[00:56:19] <Cork> did you copy your own line by mistake?
[00:56:49] <Chousuke> Can anyone help me with jquery mobile and requirejs? I can't for the life of me figure out what's going wrong with it :/ I get a properly enhanced page if I explicitly load jquery mobile in a script tag on the main page, but no matter what I try it will not work if I try to use it as a dependeincy in a require call instead.
[00:57:15] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: look at 4th line http://pastebin.com/9pnfTT41
[00:57:26] <Chousuke> I've tried everything I could find on google but nothing is working right.
[00:59:03] <xec> MrS1lentcz: the tbody with that attribute looks completely empty, is that intended?
[01:00:26] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: http://jsfiddle.net/ah3xD/2/
[01:01:03] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: i suspect your adding the rows to through ajax
[01:01:07] <xec> MrS1lentcz: also, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3471235/trigger-an-anchor-tag-using-the-click-event
[01:01:08] <Chousuke> what makes no sense to me is that if I load jqm in the head tag, it works even without jquery being explicitly loaded before it. is that supposed to happen?
[01:01:09] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: but what part are you replacing?
[01:01:16] <MrS1lentcz> xec: i need empty table rows there
[01:01:34] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: why?
[01:01:38] <xec> MrS1lentcz: okay, why? what are you supposed to be able to click?
[01:01:55] <Cork> tr without a td will just collaps
[01:01:59] <Cork> *collapse
[01:02:58] <MrS1lentcz> cork: it have to an accurate copy of destkop application, there you are clicking to empty table area for show modal dialog\
[01:03:23] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: you don't have an empty table area
[01:03:26] <Cork> the height is 0px
[01:03:41] <Cork> tr without a td inside it won't give you anything
[01:03:56] <Cork> and tbody can't have a height either
[01:04:05] <Cork> so you are better of just binding to table
[01:04:09] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: i have two rows with height 20px by browser
[01:04:12] <Cork> and set its height statically
[01:04:20] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: tr can't have a height
[01:04:53] <Cork> they take the height from the tallest td in them
[01:05:10] <Cork> (so if there is no td, no height)
[01:05:23] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: i mean you have the true, but google chrome knows it :)))
[01:05:34] <xec> MrS1lentcz: http://jsfiddle.net/ah3xD/3/
[01:05:41] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: well the spec doesn't
[01:05:43] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: ok, so catch on the table is better, ok?
[01:05:49] <Cork> so you shouldn't build it like that
[01:06:07] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: if the table needs to allow click if empty
[01:06:12] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: bind a click on the table
[01:06:18] <Cork> and give it a min-height
[01:06:25] <xec> MrS1lentcz: compare to *with table cells* http://jsfiddle.net/ah3xD/4/
[01:06:30] <Cork> the table can have a height, so it can work there
[01:06:50] <Chousuke> ... console.log prints asynchronously? derp
[01:07:18] <Chousuke> kind of weird seeing how my logging statements change when I modify a line AFTER it.
[01:08:09] <xec> Cork: giving the table a height is a bad idea imo, what if there's more content, there's no extra space to click
[01:08:47] <Cork> xec: i was assuming the click on empty was just for handling empty tables, not something like add new
[01:09:10] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: ok... thank you... so next question is related with. bootstrap shows modal dialog on some "a[data-toggle="modal"]" selector, can i create new object "a" element and call click trigger on it? if yes, do i must append this element to DOM ?
[01:09:26] <Cork> but ya, if it is something meant to handle states where the table gets filled, a fallback would solve the full problem
[01:09:31] <xec> MrS1lentcz: what is the click supposed to do?
[01:09:47] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: no you can't
[01:10:04] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: you can't fake click links
[01:10:09] <xec> MrS1lentcz: did you read the link i gave you earlier? about anchor tags and .click() ?
[01:10:32] <xec> MrS1lentcz: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3471235
[01:10:33] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: and if it isn't for clicking links; you don't need the a tag
[01:12:01] <obert> hmm border-top-color keywords values are cross-browsers?
[01:12:53] <Cork> ?g mdn border-top-color
[01:12:54] <b-ot> Cork: border-top - CSS | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-top
[01:12:57] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: i want one definiotion of create modal dialog (with twitter boostrap), if i will would change someting in future, so i want initial fake click on not exists element in DOM, if do you understand me
[01:13:24] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: is it possible?
[01:13:57] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: i don't understand what you mean no
[01:14:08] <Cork> and you can't trigger events on element that isn't in the dom
[01:14:57] <Cork> obert: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-top-color#Browser_compatibility
[01:16:30] <obert> mhm
[01:16:32] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: i need some like this: $('<a href="#projectTeam" data-toogle="modal"></a>').trigger('click'); if i clicked to other element.
[01:16:57] <Cork> uh...
[01:16:59] <Cork> why?
[01:17:27] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: i need ONE DEFITION of modal dialog, and there is in core of boostrap javascript
[01:18:12] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: and what prevents you from using $('target').modal('show') ?
[01:18:33] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: if i have many modal definitions in many parts of code, how can manage them easily? never...
[01:19:03] <Cork> so creating and fake clicking links is a "cleaner" option to you ?!?
[01:20:06] <obert> what do you use to stylizing a submit input?
[01:20:09] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: mmm, it sees good. settings are ok...
[01:20:42] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: thank you very much for found right way...
[01:20:54] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: ok fine code: var link = $('a href="#projectTeam" data-toogle="modal"></a>'); parent.append(link); link.click(); link.remove();
[01:21:16] <Cork> extremely  ugly if you ask, me but...
[01:21:31] <Cork> if you like it it's your headache
[01:24:44] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: your solving is better of course
[01:24:50] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: thank you :)

[01:26:36] <spobat> hi
[01:26:38] <spobat> any idea about that?
[01:26:38] <spobat> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6559846/Screen%20Shot%202013-08-13%20at%2010.24.53%20AM.png
[01:27:11] <Cork> spobat: sorry i'm not able to debug run images
[01:27:41] <spobat> PR is a variable a google plugin creates
[01:27:51] <spobat> the lib is called "pretty print"
[01:27:54] <Cork> ?p @ spobat
[01:28:09] <Cork> stupid bot...
[01:28:20] <Cork> spobat: make an example of the code on jsfiddle.net
[01:28:37] <Cork> or a link to the page
[01:28:47] <Cork> width instructions on how to reproduce the problem
[01:29:39] <doug65536> spobat: that's caused by use strict
[01:30:11] <Cork> uh, no strict doesn't matter
[01:30:22] <doug65536> Cork: uh, yes, see http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/pJt4B/2/
[01:30:31] <spobat> this exception just doesn't make any sense at all, right?
[01:30:42] <Cork> doug65536: http://jsfiddle.net/pJt4B/3/
[01:31:03] <Cork> spobat: you can't check for defined on a variable that doens't exist
[01:31:20] <doug65536> Cork: weird, I tested it without strict
[01:31:21] <Cork> you need to use typeof(PR) == 'undefined'
[01:31:36] <Cork> you can only do !== undefined if it is a member of an object
[01:31:42] <Cork> ex. window.PR !== undefined
[01:31:54] <spobat> okay :)
[01:39:08] <Kol> hi, i don't really know how to describe/search for this, so i'll try and ask here.. i want to make a tooltip sort of thing where i click instead of hovering, and in the tooltip i wanna have editable forms. what exactly am i looking for? D:
[01:40:00] <Cork> Kol: most any tooltip lib that let you bind click events instead of mouseenter
[01:40:11] <doug65536> Cork: I've managed to always avoid global scope completely in jquery code so I'm not accustomed to global issues :)
[01:40:55] <Kol> Cork that's kind of like a workaround though, isn't it? are there any libraries that have this functionality by default? i feel like this thing has a name D:
[01:40:55] <Successful> Need help with own extention on Jquery Mobile DateBox, stackoverflow explains more: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17614990
[01:40:56] <Cork> kol: beautytip for example
[01:41:09] <Cork> Kol: no, why would there be?
[01:41:32] <Kol> dunno, feels like i've encountered them many times before
[01:41:41] <Cork> Kol: if it is just a setting where you change the event that triggers the tooltip, why would you write a separate lib?
[01:42:01] <Cork> doug65536: it's not about global
[01:42:19] <Cork> doug65536: it's about checking if a variable is defined
[01:42:37] <Kol> well since i'm getting rid of the mouse-over functionality, i'd have to make my own close box wouldn't i?
[01:42:38] <doug65536> Cork: it's about implicit access of global (window) scope
[01:42:42] <Cork> no
[01:43:16] <Cork> doug65536: if(something) { var a = 1 } else {} if(a !== undefined) {}
[01:43:39] <Cork> it's about checking if a variable name is defined or not, and you can't do that in that way
[01:44:18] <Cork> doug65536: the scope has nothing to do with it, it's all about the parser
[01:44:53] <Cork> Kol: not really, you could have click outside the tooltip for example
[01:45:03] <Cork> Kol: and some tooltips have support for close buttons
[01:45:18] <Cork> (though the lib i mentioned doens't)
[01:45:29] <doug65536> Cork: why no exception here http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/LGsQS/1/
[01:45:30] <Cork> and on the other hand, the close button isn't hard to add
[01:45:48] <Cork> doug65536: ah, sorry it's let not var
[01:46:03] <Cork> doug65536: var is lifted out of if statements
[01:46:12] <doug65536> yes, all variables are function scope
[01:46:26] <Cork> but what i said is still true
[01:46:27] <doug65536> i.e. not C-style
[01:46:44] <doug65536> C-style == (block scope)
[01:46:53] <Cork> doug65536: == let
[01:47:07] <doug65536> let?
[01:47:10] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let
[01:47:54] <Cork> doug65536: side note, let is not safe for web use yet
[01:48:25] <doug65536> Cork: that's what I was thinking... how new does browser have to be to have that, approximately?
[01:48:39] <Cork>  * -ie
[01:49:05] <Cork> jscript doens't have let support unless ie11 implements it
[01:49:05] <doug65536> Cork: lol, ie sucks again
[01:49:37] <doug65536> the sooner people make sites that don't cater to ie, the sooner that piece of crap will die
[01:49:59] <Cork> doug65536: i honestly don't want ie to die anymore
[01:50:14] <doug65536> why not?
[01:50:15] <Cork> a market with only two browser vendors would not be good
[01:50:20] <Cork> cause presto died
[01:50:35] <Cork> i would have prefered presto to survive and trident to die
[01:50:58] <doug65536> microsoft is famous for building apis that lock you in to their stuff. they tried to pull that with web dev and it has backfired
[01:50:58] <johnline> i killed a man with a trident
[01:51:37] <Cork> doug65536: ya, i agree
[01:51:53] <Cork> doug65536: but as it is we are VERY close to getting that back again
[01:51:57] <Cork> but with webkit instead
[01:52:07] <Cork> and if trident dies, we are there
[01:52:17] <SargoDarya> What are you saying doug65536? I can't hear you over how awesome the windows api stuff is!
[01:52:28] <SargoDarya> \/s
[01:52:31] <Cork> aka webkit 80+% of the market and gecko the only alternative
[01:53:03] <Cork> and that would more or less make webkit bugs defacto web standards
[01:53:05] <doug65536> SargoDarya: oh yeah, getmessage pump sendmessage type punning case wparam/lparam is so cool :|
[01:53:11] <doug65536> cast*
[01:53:29] <johnline> also, opera switching to webkit
[01:53:44] <Cork> johnline: no opera switching to theme development
[01:53:45] <SargoDarya> doug: Don't forget those lovely 15 parameter method calls where half of them are null because they're from 3.1
[01:53:47] <johnline> atleast they will be big contributors and make it rad
[01:53:54] <Cork> opera is chromium + opera theme
[01:54:00] <johnline> atm
[01:54:02] <Cork> it's not a browser anymore
[01:54:37] <SargoDarya> doug65536: you realize though that I was kidding right?
[01:54:42] <doug65536> SargoDarya: yes
[01:54:50] <SargoDarya> good ;)
[01:55:00] <doug65536> SargoDarya: on the other hand, win32 threadpool api is amazing and blows away linux thread apis
[01:55:55] <SargoDarya> To be honest, if it comes to documenting stuff Microsoft is also great. It's just that they still carry around all those old things
[01:55:55] <johnline> they're reintegrating atleast some of the features that made it great
[01:55:59] <Cork> johnline: and a good example of how much so it is; opera fired most of there core development theme
[01:56:13] <johnline> *team?
[01:56:20] <Cork> opps ya
[01:56:29] <johnline> that sucks
[01:56:40] <johnline> it was a struggle right til the end though
[01:56:42] <Cork> johnline: opera is gone, it doesn't have any relevance anymore
[01:57:08] <johnline> shit devs not testing or developing for their browser, and then dumb users blaming the browser for websites being broken
[01:57:09] <Cork> johnline: well the web developers wanted a locked in market
[01:57:24] <tankblergh> Hi guys!   I'm using this function "window.addEventListener("resize", myFunction, false);"  It triggers when I resize the window. Can I restrict it to only trigger when resizing height?
[01:57:34] <Cork> so they supported solutions that locked opera out
[01:58:14] <Cork> tankblergh: you would have to check the height and return early if it hasn't changed
[01:58:26] <johnline> well, im going to miss 11.0
[01:58:28] <doug65536> tankblergh: it's easy to remember last size and return early when only width changed
[01:58:29] <tankblergh> I see, thanks!
[01:59:13] <Cork> johnline: sadly the "user experience" theme is sending firefox on a suicide mission
[01:59:22] <Cork> so... not sure what will happen there...
[01:59:33] <Cork> *"user experience" team
[01:59:36] <johnline> haha, firefox has been the new ie6 for years though
[01:59:45] <Cork> uh, what?
[02:00:15] <Cork> the engine is actually in fighting shape to take on chrome anyday
[02:00:42] <johnline> but it wont, because the three other browsers are on webkit
[02:00:45] <Cork> the problem is they are screwing over the users that liked firefox for the features it provided except the page rendering
[02:00:51] <johnline> and its always been clunky and top heavy
[02:01:08] <Cork> johnline: only if the web world wants to have a broken web
[02:01:18] <Cork> johnline: and no gecko isn't the ie6 webkit is
[02:01:31] <Cork> as it is getting in to a position where it's bugs becomes webstandard
[02:01:38] <Cork> that is exactly what ie6 was
[02:02:03] <rubino123> are there any mobile chat apis available for html5 mobile apps?
[02:02:10] <rubino123> text based chat
[02:02:32] <johnline> maybe, but that's down to webdevs being sloppy
[02:02:33] <Cork> rubino123: that question very generic
[02:02:54] <Cork> johnline: ya, and that is what causes the problem the web has
[02:03:06] <johnline> they all have bugs, if gecko became 90% of the market we'd be saying the same thing about gecko
[02:03:10] <rubino123> Cork:  well I am finding ios and android libs for chat but not a js based api
[02:03:25] <rubino123> Cork: specifically for mobile
[02:03:37] <Cork> johnline: gecko do have bugs, but it is quite a bit fewer then gecko
[02:03:38] <Cork> opps
[02:03:41] <Cork> *webkit
[02:03:59] <johnline> i'd rather have one uniform engine that works 99.1% of the time rather than a whole range of engines that could spew out non-expected results
[02:04:06] <Cork> johnline: and the problem is that apple has a stands that cements some of these bugs
[02:04:13] <johnline> the difference is ie's bugs and workabounds were attrocious
[02:04:17] <Cork> and that is why google have switched to blink
[02:04:37] <Cork> johnline: so is some of the bugs in webkit
[02:05:42] <seutje> forreal
[02:06:30] <seutje> also, fixed in webkit !== fixed in all webkit browsers
[02:06:33] <Cork> the core is, the web NEEDS competing rendering engines, engines that comes from compliantly different code trees
[02:06:38] <Cork> ya
[02:07:00] <Cork> there is webkit, webkit2, blink and not even those are the same cross all browsers using them
[02:07:33] <Cork> but when the mindshare of web developers becomes "there is only webkit" the standards dies
[02:07:47] <Cork> and we get back into the reverse engineering bugs again
[02:08:06] <Cork> and i DON'T even want to get into that again...

[02:17:51] <Kol> Cork i'm having trouble finding a decent tooltip library :(
[02:18:12] <Kol> many of them want me to put input in the title="" field
[02:18:17] <Kol> but i wanna put in my own html
[02:18:32] <Cork> Kol: the title is the default source for most of them ya
[02:18:45] <Cork> but also most of them have an option to have an alternative source
[02:19:10] <Cork> Kol: don't look so much at the default settings for them check what options they have
[02:19:24] <Cork> that is where you will find your solution
[02:35:04] * Successful is now away, auto-away after 20 minutes (log\on pager\on)
[02:36:03] <nisseni> not sure how "trigger" works - if I set $('.varde').trigger('change'); in a function - the input with class = "varde" should change if I initiate the function?
[02:41:23] <Cork> nisseni: no it wouldn't change but event handlers listening for the change event would trigger
[02:41:41] <nisseni> Cork: yeah, ok
[02:41:50] <Cork> nisseni: faked event normally doesn't have any effect on the element directly
[02:42:04] <Cork> there are a few exceptions though
[02:42:08] <Cork> (like checkboxes)
[02:47:04] <seutje> change is a bitch as it is
[02:47:15] <doug65536> faked events are hacky imho
[02:48:36] <Cork> doug65536: depends if the place where the handler needs to be triggered is accessable from part where it needs to be triggered
[02:48:49] <Cork> doug65536: it is often a clean way to handle things
[02:48:59] <Cork> also it is a needed thing to handle browser bugs
[02:49:59] <doug65536> I always refactor the event handling out, then make the event handler a stub that calls real handler - then I can call handler when I would have faked an event
[02:50:04] <doug65536> everything depends though

[04:01:47] <krishnaveda> Cork: how to target a th with id #name inside table with id #data ? thanks
[04:02:28] <fgh> ravenzz, e.target could be a child that triggered the event (i suppose he might be expecing to add elements like e.g. a span inside '.js-nav')
[04:02:29] <Cork> krishnaveda: just target the id
[04:02:41] <Cork> krishnaveda: id's are uniq, you don't need to use extra filters
[04:03:03] <krishnaveda> Cork: there are multiple tables with different table ids but same th ids ie name
[04:03:30] <Cork> krishnaveda: id's can't exist in more then one place, that would be invalid html
[04:04:28] <krishnaveda> Cork: $('table#table-teams th#name')
[04:04:36] <krishnaveda> Cork: something like this would work
[04:04:42] <Cork> no, that would not work
[04:04:52] <Cork> id's can't exist on more then one element
[04:04:55] <krishnaveda> Cork: could be the reason why its throwing error since I have multiple th with same ids
[04:04:56] <Cork> fix your browser html
[04:05:05] <Cork> *broken
[04:05:06] <krishnaveda> Cork: sure thanks
[04:06:40] <Cork> krishnaveda: it sounds like what you want is classes instead of id's
[04:08:39] <krishnaveda> Cork: yeah.. classes would be better option
[04:16:44] <ravenzz> fgh yeah I realized that too late :)

[04:17:43] <Danny^^P> Hi! I'm using a jquery Accordion. When the user clicks on the header, the Accordion should expand (this works) and another page should be loaded (that doesn't work). How can I realize that?
[04:19:30] <Cork> Danny^^P: you would have to use the active or beforeActive event
[04:20:18] <fgh> yw:)
[04:20:18] <Cork> accordion doens't have built in support for ajax content as far as i know
[04:22:52] <spobat> can i have some feedback on my coding style, please?
[04:22:53] <spobat> http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/29660/avoiding-dynamic-regex-creation-in-javascript/29673?noredirect=1#29673
[04:28:38] <Danny^^P> Cork: Thank you! I will have a look at this
[04:29:10] <seutje> spobat: I prefere to group var statements at the top, and when defining a function within a function, I often choose to use the whole var foo = function (){}
[04:29:59] <spobat> seutje: okay
[04:30:05] <seutje> I also tend to avoid multiline return statements
[04:30:35] <seutje> it's alright for 2 or 3 lines, but it gets confusing quite quickly after that
[04:31:13] <seutje> can't judge on the regex bits as I rly suck at those :P
[04:32:56] <spobat> Do you use 2 or 4 spaces to indent?
[04:33:17] <seutje> lol, not even going to go into that
[04:33:37] <seutje> spobat: btw, do note that u'll have to shim Array.forEach for oldIE and stuff
[04:33:48] <seutje> actually.... just oldIE

[04:34:06] <b-ot> seutje: Sorry, I can't find anything on array.foreach
[04:34:12] <seutje> b-ot: loser
[04:34:23] <Cork> seutje: don't for get Object.keys
[04:34:52] <Cork> (if you want ie support it's often better to just use $.each)

[05:16:51] <nfre> Cork:  no, i got splitted output by each character in my firebug console
[05:16:54] <sammich> nfre: it'll only split into single chars when you leave out the space
[05:17:05] <Cork> nfre: then you are doing something else
[05:17:15] <sammich> it's .split(' ') < one space between the quotes
[05:18:24] <nfre> sammich: yes... i got it, but what is the logic?
[05:18:42] <Cork> nfre: do you know what split() does?

[05:19:34] <xqo> hi, how can i select only one of the items found by select? $(".myClass")[0]
[05:19:35] <sammich> the power of deduction isn't strong in this one
[05:19:42] <xqo> hi, how can i get only one of the items found by select? $(".myClass")[0]*
[05:19:51] <sammich> xqo: $().eq(index)
[05:20:00] <Cork> no
[05:20:01] <Cork> opps
[05:20:06] <Cork> sorry read wrong
[05:20:17] <nfre> Cork:  we splitting by space.... ok..
[05:20:20] <xqo> thank you sammich
[05:21:57] <nfre> that's fine,  but what abt for this           "1.issues and text  2.discharge and text  3.manages adn text  4.acts and text."
[05:22:25] <sammich> use regex
[05:22:27] <xqo> is there a function named .sort()? i cant find any docs
[05:22:31] <Cork> there is no real way to split that sainly
[05:22:39] <sammich> xqo: there is for vanillaJS
[05:22:54] <Cork> not safe to use on the jquery object though
[05:22:55] <nfre> by any regex split and digit and dot?
[05:22:57] <xqo> sammich thank you
[05:23:06] <Cork> [0-9.]
[05:23:10] <Cork> nfre: ^
[05:23:24] <xqo> sammich can i sort(selected jquery items) ?
[05:23:32] <Cork> or if you mean digit directly followed by a dot; sure
[05:23:40] <Cork> [0-9]\.
[05:23:41] <sammich> xqo: $().toArray.sort()
[05:23:45] <xqo> thank you
[05:23:47] <sammich> xqo: $().toArray().sort()
[05:23:55] <Cork> nfre: but warning though it will remove the list number
[05:24:25] <Cork> nfre: but actually
[05:24:42] <Cork> nfre: "1.issues and text  2.discharge and text  3.manages adn text  4.acts and text.".split('  ') should work fine
[05:24:50] <Cork> as you have two space splitting each section
[05:25:11] <sammich> but not when there are spaces between the sentences in each point
[05:25:20] <Cork> it's not two space there
[05:25:21] <sammich> oh yeah, two
[05:25:51] <nfre> no split by digit and dot, but without missing digit and dot
[05:26:02] <Cork> then you arn't splitting
[05:26:15] <Cork> and yes you can, but it is a lot harder
[05:26:28] <Cork> (including loops)
[05:27:04] <nfre> Cork:  yes kind of regex match and replace
[05:27:12] <Cork> without the replace
[05:27:24] <Cork> your looking for a regex match
[05:27:33] <Cork> and that would have to then be used with a match loop
[05:27:38] <Cork> where you pick out each match
[05:27:46] <Cork> and from that build an array
[05:28:12] <Cork> doable, but you would most likely have to write a helper function, cause it becomes a bit messy having that in the normal code flow
[05:28:25] <sammich> there's a good loop idiom out there for that
[05:28:30] <sammich> need to find it
[05:28:42] <Cork> the coding it isn't hard
[05:28:51] <Cork> it's just a lot more code
[05:28:59] <sammich> it's about 5 lines iirc
[05:29:00] <Cork> ?g mdn match
[05:29:00] <b-ot> Cork: String.match - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match
[05:29:02] <nfre> ok lets say add new line before each digit
[05:29:11] <nfre> without any split and replace
[05:31:50] <nfre> "1.issues and text  2.discharge and text  3.manages adn text  4.acts and text."   to "1.issues and text  \n  2.discharge and text  \n 3.manages adn text  \n 4.acts and text."  i have also trying guys but not getting
[05:32:20] <Cork> nfre: just replace the space with \n in the split
[05:35:34] <sammich> gotcha
[05:35:35] <sammich> "1.issues and something 2.discharge and blah 3.manages 4.acts.".match(/[0-9]+?\.[A-Za-z ]*/g)
[05:35:49] <sammich> so, I guess now I know a bit of regex
[05:36:06] <sammich> nfre:
[05:36:12] <nfre> sammich:  awsome sammitch
[05:36:36] <nfre> what /g means to space?
[05:36:47] <sammich> g is global
[05:36:58] <sammich> without it, it will stop after the first match
[05:37:08] <sammich> the g is implicit in split
[05:37:31] <nfre> thank you so much sammich
[05:37:44] <sammich> no worries
[05:38:32] <Cork> sammich: hmm...
[05:38:41] <Cork> oh, damn.. right i mixed up the regex implementations...
[05:39:15] <Cork> it's ruby that totally sucks at those things
[05:39:16] <sammich> I'm only a noob at regex, but trying to learn it
[05:41:08] <sammich> this is trimmed :) "1.issues and something 2.discharge and blah 3.manages 4.acts.".match(/[0-9]+?\.[A-Za-z ]*[A-Za-z]/g)
[05:41:12] <Cork> sammich: /[0-9]+\.[[:alnum:] ]+/g should work fine too
[05:41:23] <xec> sammich: it's really easy, just hold down shift and spam all the number keys on the keyboard
[05:41:32] <Cork> xec: lol
[05:41:35] <sammich> !
[05:41:46] <sammich> but but slashes
[05:41:58] <xec> i have / as shift+7
[05:42:05] <Cork> it becomes really harry when you start to handle named sections though
[05:42:06] <sammich> &
[05:42:30] <xec> and my shift+4 is ¤
[05:42:40] <sammich> I prefer my money
[05:42:42] <xec> which I have never ever seen a use for
[05:55:07] <pagios> <pagios> hi i have http://pastie.org/8232590 , var resolution_var = document.querySelector('#resolution') is always returning 320  and not 640 when 640 is selected why
[05:57:41] <RRR2_> How do you store a polygon with arcs?
[06:02:00] <sammich> pagios: http://jsfiddle.net/dp4Zw/
[06:03:06] <pagios> what did i miss
[06:03:44] <sammich> $('#id') only selects the top item
[06:03:58] <sammich> first*, since you should only have one #id per page
[06:05:02] <pagios> sammich: you mean this will select the first item? var resolution_var = document.querySelector('#resolution');
[06:05:36] <sammich> no, document.getElementById('resolution') will
[06:06:16] <pagios> i want to return the one selected
[06:07:21] <pagios> what should i change sammich didnt get it...
[06:07:41] <sammich> are you using jQuery or vanilla JS?
[06:08:04] <pagios> jquery
[06:08:29] <sammich> see my fiddle
[06:09:19] <pagios> any easier way?
[06:10:22] <sammich> pagios: http://jsfiddle.net/dp4Zw/1/
[06:11:10] <pagios> so i can say: checked= $('form').find(':checked').val());
[06:11:55] <sammich> $('form :checked').val(), to be shorter, yeah
[06:12:42] <freebirD2> you guys, my fancy-box wont open a html page, why ? 		<a data-rel="fancybox"  class="blog-continue-reading gdl-button" data-fancybox-group=""		href="teatro1.html"	title=""> Llink</a>	
[06:13:44] <pagios>  var resolution_var = $('form').find(':checked').val(); sammich  Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[06:14:24] <sammich> yeah, you need jQuery
[06:14:43] <platzhirsch> At the beginning of $ -> I hide a portion of the HTML code with .hide(), sometimes however, I see it at the beginning after the page is rendered, how can I speed this up?
[06:14:46] <mklappstuhl> doing something like: $(window).resize(function () { this.reLayout(); }) in another class how would I access the current class (which is this outside the resize block) within the block?
[06:15:06] <freebirD2> anyone please ?
[06:15:12] <pagios> i am using a jscript function:    toggle1 = function () {                toggleStatus(start, stop);               var resolution_var = $('form :checked').val();
[06:15:30] <seutje> mklappstuhl: your "this" references the window object
[06:15:38] <mklappstuhl> seutje: exactly ;)
[06:16:00] <mklappstuhl> can I somehow transport the 'outside this' inside the block?
[06:16:04] <seutje> within ur class, store a reference to this and then use an anonymous function as a callback
[06:16:09] <seutje> I mak example
[06:16:20] <sammich> _this = this, mmmhm
[06:16:29] <pagios> sammich: helppp
[06:18:50] <seutje> sammich: I prefere _self :P
[06:18:58] <seutje> used to be so confused when I saw var that = this
[06:19:02] <seutje> mklappstuhl: http://jsbin.com/iqoxek/1/edit
[06:19:35] <sammich> pagios: you need jQuery, because you're using jQuery. You can have jQuery by putting it in the <head> <script src="/link/to/jquery.js"></script>
[06:19:54] <sammich> hmm, I like the sound of _that
[06:20:00] <seutje> lol
[06:20:11] <seutje> the underscore is cause self is future reserved
[06:20:15] <seutje> that isn't, is it?
[06:20:22] <seutje> ?g javascript future reserved words
[06:20:23] <b-ot> seutje: Reserved Words - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Reserved_Words
[06:20:37] <sammich> isn't underscore for private properties?
[06:21:09] <seutje> or rather, self was future reserved but never made it to actual reserved
[06:21:13] <seutje> or some mess
[06:21:46] <seutje> hah, private properties
[06:21:49] <seutje> good one
[06:22:19] <sammich> for this channel sure, but I've used other languages (gasp!)
[06:22:37] <sammich> besides, a closure is pretty 'private'
[06:22:41] <seutje> I don't try to compare coding styles in different languages
[06:22:51] <seutje> it... just doesn't work
[06:23:20] <sammich> I mean, underscore has sematic meaning for programming in general
[06:23:24] <sammich> as does double underscore
[06:23:40] <sammich> just as ALLCAPS is for static consts
[06:24:55] <seutje> now compare that to the generally-accepted-coding style of brainfuck :P
[06:25:20] <seutje> now the whole variables construct already falls apart
[06:25:36] <seutje> granted, extreme example, but there's a ton more nuanced ones
[06:26:02] <sammich> I like order
[06:26:16] <seutje> me too
[06:26:26] <seutje> but my coding style in PHP is wildly different from JS
[06:26:32] <sammich> that's PHP
[06:27:04] <sammich> I see what you mean, but given the opportunity, I'll want to stick to a style
[06:27:05] <seutje> it's pointless to blame a single part of an equation for the equation not matching up
[06:27:40] <sammich> are we talking about naming semantics or scope?
[06:27:46] <seutje> I often catch myself going all "var" on php
[06:28:11] <seutje> both
[06:28:16] <sammich> yeah, I once typed console.log into a SQL editor
[06:29:14] <doug65536> everybody that knows several languages periodically accidentally uses the wrong language when transitioning between them
[06:29:43] <sammich> well, that goes for anything
[06:29:59] <seutje> not limited to programming languages btw
[06:30:02] <sammich> I just find it amusing
[06:30:15] <seutje> often can't think of the dutch word for something and just blurt out the english
[06:31:18] <sammich> imo, that's not quite the same thing
[06:31:46] <sammich> since you're already in the correct frame of mind, jumping to another mid-frame is more intentional
[06:32:38] <seutje> sometimes I only notice it wasn't in the right language after I've said it
[06:33:30] <seutje> then again, it could be far worse: https://www.makethatthecatwise.nl/
[06:34:39] <Saaether> o.O is the point of that site just to make captions that make no sense?
[06:41:45] <seutje> Saaether: it's dutch saying, literally translated to english
[06:41:53] <seutje> making it hard for anyone to comprehend
[06:42:12] <Saaether> ya i caught on after i read a bit more heh
[06:42:51] <thaifood> Can anyone tell me how to use a wildcard to get both selects on change on line 16 of this code please ?  http://fpaste.org/31788/40133113/
[06:44:20] <Saaether> thaifood  $('select[id^="activities_limit"]')
[06:44:53] <thaifood> works, awesome,  thanks !!!!!!
[06:46:11] <Saaether> thaifood if they are going to be the only selects on the page you could just go with a simple $('select') as well
[06:48:09] <thaifood> nice
[06:52:27] <blez> I have multiple elements with class 'audio'
[06:52:37] <blez> but when I make $('.audio') it returns only one
[06:52:42] <sammich> http://jsperf.com/selectionskillzq
[06:52:44] <blez> what can be the cause?
[06:53:42] <Maximilian> hello guys. One question: can I return a value from an event? lets say log($($el).trigger('imCustom');)  and  $($el).on('imCustom',function(){return 'yay'}) or shoud iI use a callback insted?
[06:54:16] <sammich> events are async, so always a callback
[07:15:28] <onethfour> how do I do this: table[align=left|right]
[07:15:41] <onethfour> or even better table[align!=none]
[07:16:46] <seutje> onethfour: that would only not catch tables where the attribute is exactly that
[07:17:12] <seutje> prolly want $('table[align="left"], table[align="right"]')
[07:17:16] <onethfour> oh
[07:17:31] <onethfour> but its in a subset of other stuff
[07:17:48] <seutje> so .find('table[align="left"], table[align="right"]')
[07:17:58] <onethfour> $('div.sideblock div.content > table[align=left]').removeAttr('align');
[07:18:35] <onethfour> how do i do "containsAnythingExcept "none"
[07:18:41] <seutje> $('div.sideblock div.content').children('table[align="left"], table[align="right"]').removeAttr(...)
[07:19:00] <onethfour> how do i just match the table who has an align attribute?
[07:19:22] <seutje> [align]
[07:19:28] <seutje> well table[align]
[07:19:30] <onethfour> perfect, thanks
[07:19:37] <seutje> I suggest you read up on CSS selectors
[07:19:57] <seutje> cause these aren't jQuery specific
[07:20:16] <seutje> note that table[align] will also match <table align>
[07:20:17] <rethus> I use the nivo-slider. If I start the Page in Browser, all Images are loaded ( visible). Any idea, if there is a option, to show only one image, and the other, if they are fully loaded?
[07:22:59] <RRR2> How do you store a polygon with arcs?
[07:27:09] <gordian> what's the best way to actually get a return value from load()? http://jsfiddle.net/Zxbg7/
[07:27:25] <gordian> or save a value for later use
[07:27:27] <RRR2> callback
[07:28:19] <gordian> RRR2: got a handy example?
[07:28:51] <Saaether> gordian youre confusing what .load() does.. load() retrieves data from a url
[07:28:59] <Saaether> `api load @ gordian
[07:29:00] <b-ot> gordian: .load(): Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[07:29:10] <Maximilian> is there a way to trigger evebnts synchronus?
[07:29:17] <Maximilian> events*
[07:29:32] <gordian> then what would be a good way to get image dimensions?
[07:29:54] <gordian> …and save them for manipulation?
[07:29:59] <gordian> (assuming i know the image URL)
[07:32:08] <gordian> Saaether: what do you recommend?
[07:32:19] <Frantic> guys, is there some library that works across browsers for playing audio? (maybe with flash fallback too?) For video I'm using videojs, which is awesome, but am having a really hard time finding something as good for audio, any ideas?
[07:32:34] <RRR2> there was one..
[07:32:44] <Maximilian> sammich isnt js single threaded?
[07:32:56] <RRR2> perhaps it's better to just use flash.. but then I remembered mobile phones
[07:36:58] <Saaether> gordian i was wrong, that actually does work http://jsfiddle.net/Zxbg7/3/ just not the way you were doing it
[07:37:37] <gordian> Saaether: yeah but that's not what i need ;-)
[07:38:26] <gordian> i need load() to return a value or be able to use this.height outside of load() within foo() after it's called
[07:38:31] <gordian> thanks for trying though
[07:40:37] <fission6> is there a way to get a hash of a form, i know there is serialize but i want a js object
[07:41:58] <Saaether> gordian what is it you are trying to do?
[07:42:54] <gordian> Saaether: i want to get an image's dimensions, then i need to use those dimensions later on in a string
[07:43:20] <gordian> but the image isn't part of the DOM
[07:43:35] <gordian> i think i might just keep a JSON object of images and their dimensions somewhere and reference that
[07:46:14] <Saaether> gordian since you're working with asynchronous data you will need to use a call back
[07:46:31] <gordian> Saaether: and i'm not sure how to put that into practice
[07:46:41] <gordian> if you could show an example that would be very helpful
[07:46:50] <gordian> …or at least point me in the right direction please
[07:52:34] <Grundell> Hello, at the moment im developing a web-application that is supposed to be a application that generates tickets for the subway system... the only thin i have left to do is to get the "edit" function to work. The thing is that it is supposed to look exactly like the Iphone Messages. So now i need to get the button that says edit to work as in an iphone.. does any one have the possibility to help me / point me to a tutoria
[07:52:34] <Grundell> l ?

[07:53:49] <sunbeam> About twitter bootstrap, I have 2 col-lg-5 and the col-lg-2 thats between them should be smaller
[07:53:53] <sunbeam> any idea how i can best do this
[07:54:02] <Saaether> gordian your first example already contained an anonymous function call back in the load function. you need to either do what you need to do from in there or call another function from it to do the work
[07:54:59] <Grundell> grafi: ???
[07:55:27] <gordian> sunbeam: try #twitter-bootstrap
[07:56:38] <daveAway> 'lo, i have an object, and when i log it, it has 0={ Location = blah.jpg } 0=
[07:56:44] <daveAway> gah, pressed enter too quick
[07:57:02] <daveAway> to access the variable at '0' i type imagearray[0].Location
[07:57:12] <daveAway> that's correct yes?
[07:58:45] <gordian> Saaether: any chance of seeing an example?
[07:59:04] <gordian> (of callina nother function)
[07:59:54] <gordian> this doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/Zxbg7/4/
[08:00:07] <Saaether> gordian http://jsfiddle.net/Zxbg7/5/
[08:00:45] <gordian> hmmm
[08:00:47] <gordian> awesome
[08:00:49] <gordian> thank you
[08:14:18] <sayd> jquery validate generates a warning label when i blur it even if if the field validates. also gives it an error class, anyone know why?
[08:28:40] <grafi> seems like the field doesnt validate
[08:45:16] <sayd> yah it was another validator that was failing that is tied to other fields
[08:45:46] <sayd> basically im validating a cc, and  want to show a message when there is a problem in one
[08:46:03] <InvidFlower> Anyone know of a plugin like BlockUI but instead of blocking a certain element, it blocks everything BUT that element?
[08:46:15] <sayd> of 3 fields. i define the errorContainer property but i am still seeing the messages appear next to the input fields
[08:52:51] <fission6> how do i escape html and put it into a div, ie. i want to insert <script>….</script> as readable html on the page not an actual script
[08:57:19] <mst1228> fission6: if you use $.text instead of $.html, the content will be inserted as a text node instead of a script element
[08:57:28] <fission6> thanks
[08:59:42] <grafi> something like that InvidFlower http://jquerytools.org/documentation/toolbox/expose.html ?
[09:01:57] <fission6> why am i getting a token error with this $tag_row.find('.tag-code').text('<script>hey there</script>');
[09:05:10] <asdfz0mg> fission6 what does it say?
[09:06:27] <fission6> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[09:06:37] <InvidFlower> grafi Thanks! That does look like the kind of thing I need. I have a bulk edit situation where I want to pop up a modal and add a checkbox column to the grid, but not be able to click on stuff outside of the modal or grid.
[09:06:50] <fission6> $tag_row.find('.tag-code').text('<SCRIPT SRC="somesite" TYPE="text/javascript"></SCRIPT>');
[09:07:06] <asdfz0mg> fission6 is $tag_row defined?
[09:07:12] <fission6> yes
[09:07:16] <asdfz0mg> and is it an jquery object?
[09:07:54] <Cork> fission6: where are you running this code?
[09:08:00] <fission6> in chrome
[09:08:08] <Cork> fission6: i meant where in the page
[09:08:25] <Cork> inline, external script file, ?
[09:09:01] <Cork> fission6: i suspect you run it inline in html, and the html parser finds the </script> tag in the string
[09:09:10] <fission6> inside a submit handler and then an ajax response, a form is submitted, i get an id in a response, and i want to render <Script src="http://someurl?id=MYID"></script>
[09:09:12] <Cork> so the javascript gets cropt
[09:09:39] <Cork> try something like '...</scr' + 'ipt>'
[09:10:33] <fission6> Cork https://dpaste.de/ABNP7/
[09:10:55] <Cork> fission6: where are this function defined?
[09:11:05] <fission6> inline html
[09:11:06] <Cork> <script> inline code</script ?
[09:11:07] <Cork> ya
[09:11:18] <Cork> so do what i described up there ^
[09:11:51] <fission6> ok thank you!
[09:13:23] <devslash> I have a jquery based file browser plugin called jqueryFileTree. I am trying to capture keypress events with the event $('#myfileTree li').on("keydown",function(e) { which is inside of $(document).ready(function () { but my keypress event isnt triggering
[09:20:10] <orentanay> I'm using jq validate, but I need to limit the sum length of first and last name fields. Here is where is get silly. Different characters have different widths, but the width of my available space is a fixed width. Are there any tricks to validate length so that the sum length of 2 fields does not exceed available width in pixels?
[09:20:53] <orentanay> damn, that just sounds silly.
[09:21:18] <Kol> hi, i'm trying to traverse through a table using the .each method. right now i'm going through the <th> values with $('#Monthlydata th').each(function() { ... an example <th> is <th><abbr title="text">Blah</abbr></th>. how do i get the value "text"?
[09:22:00] <Tomashe> var bgMusic = document.getElementById("idx-img-audio");
[09:22:00] <Tomashe> 	var bgMusicEnd = bgMusic.buffered.end(0);
[09:22:05] <Tomashe> i get error on the second line
[09:22:09] <Tomashe> any idea why?
[09:22:25] <Tomashe> Uncaught Error: IndexSizeError: DOM Exception 1
[09:22:25] <Tomashe> 	
[09:23:03] <devslash> how do i capture keypress events on a list item
[09:28:41] <BillCriswell> devslash: $('li').on('keypress', doSomething);
[09:42:41] <Kol> http://jsfiddle.net/PSUDp/2/ can anyone have a look? the question's in the comments of the javascript
[09:45:49] <duch_kazatel> Kol - you had some minor problems: http://jsfiddle.net/RrPYY/
[09:46:39] <RRR2> How do I make a constructor inherit from another constructor
[09:47:07] <Kol> oh i see duch_kazatel thanks
[09:47:12] <Kol> i can't set array values with date[x]?
[09:47:23] <duch_kazatel> kol - why would you need to?
[09:47:49] <Kol> just wondering. that's how i do it in other languages :>
[09:48:00] <duch_kazatel> date[x] isn't going to set array values - you're creating an object with properties with that notation - javascript doesn't have associative arrays like other languages.
[09:49:04] <BillCriswell> Kol: You can use .map(). http://jsfiddle.net/PSUDp/4/
[09:49:10] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Ah, crap, didn't see you talking.
[09:49:28] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell - it's fine :)
[09:50:39] <Kol> damn that's confusing
[09:51:02] <duch_kazatel> what is?
[09:51:08] <Kol> using .map
[09:51:28] <duch_kazatel> if you just need an array, use a plain old array
[09:52:21] <duch_kazatel> .map() is great for iterating over collections of stuff, but in your case not really all that necessary.
[09:53:58] <duch_kazatel> i was perusing the jquery docs and found this - http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/.  specifically, that they've deprecated it.  what are we supposed to use instead of this?
[09:54:07] <duch_kazatel> (this meaning toggle)
[09:58:52] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: http://api.jquery.com/toggle/ is still there, it was the toggle event that was deprecated... that's kind of confusing
[09:59:12] <duch_kazatel> that's what I'm talking about - the event is gone, but the animation is there now instead.
[09:59:32] <duch_kazatel> aaah nevermind i get it.
[10:00:22] <RyanD> http://jsfiddle.net/XPUrZ/
[10:00:31] <RyanD> Condensed it in right now to a fiddle
[10:00:35] <RyanD> any reason why this won't work?
[10:00:46] <RyanD> (It's not right now)...
[10:01:50] <RyanD> err
[10:01:51] <RyanD> http://jsfiddle.net/XPUrZ/1/
[10:03:19] <BillCriswell> You want to feed the val() function the value you want to select.
[10:03:45] <BillCriswell> RyanD: jQuery('#node_device_version').val('0.40.0.0'); like this.
[10:04:57] <RyanD> hmm
[10:05:08] <RyanD> so if i wanted to select it
[10:05:09] <RyanD> jQuery('#node_device_version').val('0.40.0.0').select();
[10:05:21] <RyanD> i thought val was only for the value attr
[10:05:33] <RyanD> hence using contains
[10:05:34] <BillCriswell> I think you want .focus()
[10:06:11] <BillCriswell> jQuery('#node_device_version').val('0.3.22.0').focus()
[10:06:23] <dwarder> in my $(function() {
[10:06:43] <dwarder> i click on something that is supposed to Ajax
[10:07:16] <dwarder> but it doesn't fire up
[10:07:18] <dwarder> why?
[10:07:47] <dwarder> though if i go to console and type the exact same command it got executed?
[10:08:03] <duch_kazatel> dwarder that's almost impossible to answer without seeing any code.  got a jsfiddle?
[10:08:36] <dwarder> i see, that needs to be replicated
[10:10:04] <devslash> how do i capture a keypress inside a jquery element that contains list items ? ive tried $('#myelement).keypress(function(e) {
[10:11:01] <duch_kazatel> devslash - try $('#myelement).on('keypress', function(e){...}) ?
[10:18:04] <RRR2> Why jQuery isn't an array?
[10:18:19] <duch_kazatel> Because it's a function?
[10:18:31] <duch_kazatel> how would it do any of what it does if it were a plain old array?
[10:18:35] <RRR2> right, why jQuery.prototype isn't an array
[10:18:55] <RRR2> Well, they add the methods to the array
[10:18:57] <snover> RRR2: you can’t extend Array until es.next
[10:19:17] <RRR2> es.next?
[10:19:27] <snover> es6, maybe
[10:19:35] <duch_kazatel> next version of ecmascript.
[10:19:36] <RRR2> Oh
[10:19:46] <RRR2> lemme try..
[10:21:35] <RRR2> In chrome seemed to work actually..
[10:21:40] <RRR2> perhaps it's a bug
[10:21:50] <duch_kazatel> RRR2 - no, some browsers will support things others done.
[10:21:52] <duch_kazatel> *don't
[10:22:14] <RRR2> oh
[10:22:29] <duch_kazatel> they all have their own implementation of ecmascript.  Javascript is the mozilla version, while IE's is called JScript.
[10:23:11] <devslash> duch_kazatel, that event has to be insiode of document.ready right  ?
[10:24:09] <RRR2> Firefox worked too, I'm going to try in IE
[10:24:27] <duch_kazatel> devslash - you have to bind the event when the element exists in the document.
[10:25:26] <devslash> its not dynamically created but it is dynamically populated
[10:26:27] <duch_kazatel> you said it's a list, right?
[10:26:32] <duch_kazatel> does the UL exist on pageload?
[10:27:01] <defaultro> anyone here uses select2 plugin?
[10:27:33] <duch_kazatel> because, if so, you can do this: $('#myParentUl').on('keypress', 'li', function(e){...});
[10:27:52] <duch_kazatel> however, i have to ask, why are you looking at keypresses like that?
[10:29:11] <devslash> duch_kazatel, im using a jquery plugin called jquery file tree which displays a file listing of files on my server. it displays files and folders using an UL
[10:29:35] <devslash> i want to capture keystrokes inside of it so i can implement keyboard shortcuts'
[10:29:59] <RRR2> IE9 with compability mode with IE7 worked, so why exactly jQuery.prototype doesn't inherit from Array.prototype?
[10:30:00] <duch_kazatel> could you support them for the entire page, then?
[10:30:27] <devslash> when you load the page, PHP dynamically populates the list
[10:30:44] <duch_kazatel> could you support keyboard shortcuts for the whole page, then?
[10:30:52] <devslash> i already do
[10:31:04] <devslash> but i want to process KB events for this one element
[10:31:11] <devslash> when it has the focus
[10:32:10] <duch_kazatel> aaah.  yeah you have to bind to a parent element that either exists on pageload, or dynamically bind to the element itself.
[10:32:50] <devslash> what would be the parent ?
[10:32:59] <duch_kazatel> i have no idea - what's the markup on the page like?
[10:33:13] <devslash> the list itself ? that is $('#myelement') vs $('#myelement li') ?
[10:33:36] <duch_kazatel> no - the actual HTML.
[10:33:59] <devslash> this is what my html code is like:  <div id="myfileTree" class="fileTreeCSS"></div>
[10:34:17] <duch_kazatel> there we go - and within that div ID you generate the list, right?
[10:34:36] <devslash> almost
[10:34:37] <devslash> 1 sec
[10:35:09] <devslash> with that HTML and this jquery code: http://pastebin.com/cGkkHiEH
[10:35:18] <duch_kazatel> and that HTML exists at pageload - so you'd do something like $('#myfileTree').on('keypress', 'li', function(e){...});
[10:35:37] <devslash> and would that have to be in document.ready ?
[10:35:48] <duch_kazatel> it should be, yeah.
[10:36:00] <duch_kazatel> or placed after the html in the document.
[10:36:07] <devslash> because at the moment i have it display an alert  but that isnt getting triggered when i click on the element and press a key
[10:36:25] <devslash> i have all my JS in an external file
[10:36:27] <duch_kazatel> pastebin is rough - have a jsfiddle for it?
[10:36:54] <duch_kazatel> actually, nvm.
[10:37:05] <devslash> this isnt exact but this is what i am looking at doing http://jsfiddle.net/E7MSN/201/
[10:37:16] <duch_kazatel> check out the .on() method.
[10:37:21] <defaultro> hey guys, when I type in something in the input box, it displays a dropdown containing the letter and other suggestions. How does it populate the dropdown?
[10:37:49] <defaultro> it's similar to google when we search
[10:38:12] <devslash> duch_kazatel, im using on
[10:38:35] <duch_kazatel> i'm not seeing it anywhere in that fiddle.
[10:38:52] <devslash> i was talking about my site not the fiddle
[10:39:24] <devslash> http://jsfiddle.net/E7MSN/202/
[10:40:19] <duch_kazatel> devslash - that's not at all what i said to do.  again -  $('#myfileTree').on('keypress', 'li', function(e){...}); - notice that the li is passed as an arg to the .on() method.
[10:41:12] <duch_kazatel> also, that setup is weird - you can't do that i don't think since keypress doesn't have context like that iirc.
[10:42:14] <duch_kazatel> check out this article, it'll help clarify the keypress event and related stuff: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/keys.html
[10:42:53] <duch_kazatel> i'd consider how those anchors are getting "focus" so the keypress runs against them.
[10:43:12] <devslash> i think that thats my problem
[10:43:16] <Kol> how do i save a reference to an element for future use
[10:43:29] <devslash> the element doesnt have the focus so it doesnt trigger the keypress event
[10:43:41] <duch_kazatel> devslash that's probably exactly it.
[10:44:23] <devslash> so how do i detect which element has the focus
[10:44:52] <clime> hey, with jquery ui dialog. Can I somehow get the dialog object itself so I can access its method like this: dialog.open()?
[10:45:39] <duch_kazatel> devslash - you could do something like console.log($(this)); - that might tell you.
[10:47:44] <dwarder> is it possible to have date not selected by default http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/ ?
[10:48:35] <grafi> hm oô
[10:48:48] <DarkGhost`> for JQMIGRATE I can't find any of the things they are saying are deprecated
[10:48:54] <clime> dwarder: you can $( ".selector" ).datepicker( "setDate", "10/12/2012" ); on document.ready
[10:49:13] <grafi> but not selected oô
[10:49:17] <clime> ooh
[10:49:29] <grafi> dwarder there is nothing selected oô
[10:49:45] <dwarder> grafi: by default, today is highlighted
[10:49:56] <grafi> highlighted != selected though
[10:50:07] <grafi> its just giving you a frame of reference
[10:50:19] <dwarder> grafi: i guess i just need to css it
[10:50:23] <grafi> if you dont want that, hack the css class for "today"
[10:50:27] <grafi> yes
[10:50:28] <grafi> :P
[10:50:44] <dwarder> grafi: hmm, but it is also selected, todays date
[10:50:49] <dwarder> grafi: i don't want that
[10:51:04] <grafi> how is it selected? for me the text field is empty
[10:51:25] <dwarder> grafi: click on inline please
[10:51:42] <dwarder> from the right menu
[10:51:45] <grafi> oh
[10:51:46] <grafi> ok
[10:52:01] <dwarder> "Display inline"
[10:52:11] <zizzl> hey guys, I'm having an issue getting jQueryMobile and jQueryUI to work together... Any suggestions on how to get jQueryMobile to only kick in on mobile devices, or using media queries?
[10:52:56] <duch_kazatel> zizzl - iirc jquery ui is all ready in jquery mobile.
[10:53:12] <aksu> hi is there some errors in the codebrainz
[10:53:32] <zizzl> is that true, not sure...
[10:53:35] <grafi> dwarder but something has got to be selected, no?
[10:53:36] <zizzl> duch_kazatel
[10:53:47] <zizzl> I've seen a lot on how they don't work well together
[10:53:56] <aksu> is there some errors  in the code : http://pastebin.com/gEC0RhdP loading spinner just keep rolling
[10:54:25] <leehambley> does anyone have a theory on why a site that I have that's still on jq 1.7 would report this: $().jquery => "1.10.2"
[10:54:27] <duch_kazatel> zizzl - you really shouldn't load up jquery ui at the same time, but jqm includes some basics that should help.
[10:54:39] <dwarder> grafi: well ok, but i want it to look like nothing is selected
[10:54:41] <sekyms> Does anyone have any experience auto running QUnit tests from Visual Studio?  Not from a CI server.
[10:54:43] <leehambley> the site is www.freiminuten.de that I've been charged with repairing (it's horrible)
[10:54:52] <Kol> http://jsfiddle.net/PSUDp/10/ question is in the comments. any ideas?
[10:54:55] <leehambley> it's loading jquery 1.7 from the google CDN, and the headers in that file look correct
[10:55:07] <dwarder> grafi: and then upon click it must be another color
[10:55:16] <grafi> dwarder no idea how to do that ... but i think its not a good idea
[10:55:28] <zizzl> duch_kazatel, I have an accordion that I need to use, that's the only reson, any suggestions?
[10:55:51] <duch_kazatel> zizzl build your own ;) don't load up all of jquery UI just to use one feature imo.
[10:56:30] <clime> dwarder: $('#your-div0id td.ui-datepicker-today a').removeClass('ui-state-highlight');
[10:57:06] <DarkGhost`> for JQMIGRATE I can't find any of the things they are saying are deprecated
[10:57:16] <dwarder> clime: hmm, haven't thought about it, let me try this
[10:58:09] <RRR2> http://jsfiddle.net/WEpcr/2/
[10:58:11] <RRR2> WELP
[10:58:13] <Saaether> leehambley look at your application js
[10:58:21] <Saaether> jQuery JavaScript Library v1.10.2
[10:58:44] <leehambley> argh, probably rails included that >_<
[10:58:46] <leehambley> thanks for the tip
[10:59:06] <leehambley> thanks ^
[10:59:14] <Saaether> np
[10:59:49] <Kol> oh nvm i figured it out
[11:00:25] <dwarder> clime: thank you
[11:00:55] <duch_kazatel> wait RRR2 are you trying to figure out why jQuery.prototype and array.prototype are different?
[11:01:30] <clime> dwarder: you are welcome:)
[11:05:16] <RRR2_> duch_kazatel: of course not, I was trying to make jQuery inherit from Array prototype
[11:05:48] <Kol> what do curly braces {} in jquery represent?
[11:06:02] <Kol> like when giving data to jquery flot
[11:06:23] <RRR2> Objects?
[11:06:25] <duch_kazatel> curly braces are apart of JS - they signify an object.
[11:06:38] <RRR2> Learn JS first.
[11:06:42] <RRR2> lol
[11:12:11] <devslash> duch_kazatel, im finding that i cant set the focus on any element'
[11:12:20] <zizzl> duch_kazatel can't find jQuery accordion by itself
[11:12:43] <zizzl> I tried the UI builder but it still conflicts with mobile
[11:13:35] <duch_kazatel> zizzle - you're going to have to build the feature, not use jquery UI
[11:14:01] <duch_kazatel> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0-rc.1/docs/demos/widgets/accordions/
[11:14:03] <duch_kazatel> does that help?
[11:15:26] <devslash> duch_kazatel, i did this: $('#myelement').focus() then $(document.activeElement) in the debugger. no matter what I do, the 2nd command returns the body element
[11:17:38] <duch_kazatel> devslash - that's because .focus() doesn't do what you think it does.
[11:17:58] <duch_kazatel> devslash it binds an even handler when you focus on that element
[11:19:03] <devslash> ok
[11:21:48] <Kol> how do i select 'all but last'
[11:21:54] <zizzl> duch_kazatel so I would think that I wouldn't have to call UI right? For some reason the accordion breaks when just call mobile
[11:22:20] <Kol> this.not().last() ?
[11:24:00] <duch_kazatel> zizzl you shouldn't be using jquery Ui for that at all imo.
[11:24:34] <zizzl> right, so I'm not calling it now, just jquery mobile, and it doesn't work now
[11:24:59] <zizzl> let me read the docs
[11:25:22] <Illusioneer> I know I must be doing someething wrong here, I am trying to submit form data via jquery ajax/post when I click the button.  If i put the ajax in the console and run it, I get the expected response but inside the $(#form).click(function(…) it does a get instead of a post
[11:26:24] <doug65536> Illusioneer: are you taking a parameter in your on('submit', function(...parameter here...)  ?
[11:26:59] <doug65536> Illusioneer: show the relevant code in jsfiddle.net
[11:27:32] <doug65536> Illusioneer: you shouldn't be posting in a button click
[11:27:46] <doug65536> Illusioneer: you should be handling the on submit event on the form
[11:28:58] <Illusioneer> ok
[11:29:15] <Illusioneer> just curious why on the submit event rather than click?
[11:30:46] <Kol> i thought .next() only chooses a single element? why is it doing what nextAll() would do here? http://jsfiddle.net/PSUDp/13
[11:35:20] <jonathancutrell> Hey folks.
[11:47:16] <jugstah> anyone know the correct way to grab the referrer ith jquery?
[11:47:40] <jugstah> var ref = document.referrer; seems to be giving me null values
[11:50:11] <jugstah> or at least a good way to get the referring url
[12:00:39] <RRR2> jugstah: you can't get the referer with JavaScript alone, try server-side, even then, browsers don't have to send the referer
[12:01:27] <BillCriswell> if (document.referrer.indexOf('porn') ) alert('YOU NAUGHTY BOY')
[12:01:53] <RRR2> !-1== true
[12:02:06] <BillCriswell> if (document.referrer.indexOf('porn') > -1 ) alert('YOU NAUGHTY BOY')
[12:02:07] <RRR2> ?
[12:02:31] <RRR2> makes sense
[12:03:21] <jugstah> hmm
[12:03:29] <RRR2> while(1)alert("Ya can't stop me");
[12:03:37] <BillCriswell> In chrome I can!
[12:03:39] <jugstah> heh
[12:03:43] <jugstah> this is between two sites
[12:03:58] <jugstah> so.. if site 2 refers the user to site 1, on site 1, i need to pop a modal
[12:04:10] <jugstah> so in this case, i oughta use a jquery cookie to set the reerrer?
[12:04:24] <Technical_13> Why are you assuming indexOf( 'porn' ) == boy?
[12:04:34] <jugstah> cuz he's a porn-fan-boy :-)
[12:04:50] <BillCriswell> Ugh, fine. "person"
[12:04:59] <RRR2> HUMAN
[12:05:43] <grafi> sounds like a safe bet to me ...
[12:05:55] <grafi> i wonder if there are any studies about that ^^
[12:06:05] <RRR2> if (document.referrer.indexOf('porn') > -1 ) alert('YOU NAUGHTY #FEMINIST ')
[12:06:12] <RRR2> lol
[12:06:20] <jugstah> so, RR2/Bill, best to set a cookie rather than rely on docuemtn.referrer?
[12:06:22] <grafi> thats gonna get you in trouble RRR2
[12:06:33] <RRR2> grafi: I
[12:06:35] <RRR2> was joking
[12:06:43] <RRR2> >inb4 k-line
[12:06:49] <grafi> that really doesnt matter
[12:06:54] <RRR2> Okay
[12:07:13] <grafi> feminism is weird that way
[12:08:19] <RRR2> jugstah: Setting a cookies seems okay
[12:08:41] <RRR2> jugstah: keep in mind peoples like to disable cookies
[12:10:34] <grafi> thats why you use localstorage ^^
[12:10:50] <RRR2> Disabling cookies disables localstorage
[12:10:53] <RRR2> at least in chrome
[12:10:58] <RRR2> throws errors
[12:11:00] <RRR2> try ti
[12:11:04] <grafi> cool
[12:11:14] <grafi> i wonder if thats true for firefox
[12:11:37] <jugstah> well, whats the best/easy way?
[12:11:45] <jugstah> otherwise, i'll just do cookies.
[12:12:09] <jugstah> (if it makes any difference, this is a windows environment)
[12:12:12] <RRR2> that you edit with JavaScript ALL the URLS so they contain the preferences
[12:12:22] <RRR2> Does it reminds you of something?
[12:12:35] <Cpudan80> Hello folks
[12:12:36] <RRR2> (Yes, I'm talking about google)
[12:12:59] <Cpudan80> I'm using curvycorners and simpletip simultaneously and it seems that there's some kind of conflict
[12:13:10] <Cpudan80> because the tooltips no longer work with curvycorners "enabled"
[12:13:23] <RRR2> what is curvycorners
[12:13:43] <jugstah> it puts corners on div boxes
[12:13:59] <RRR2> Why not CSS3
[12:13:59] <jugstah> old ancient js app
[12:14:01] <jugstah> :)
[12:14:02] <RRR2> oh
[12:14:05] <RRR2> CSS2?
[12:14:18] <RRR2> Well, that's interesting
[12:14:21] <jugstah> been a while, i dont use it anymore
[12:14:41] <RRR2> jugstah: Does it uses images?
[12:15:30] <jugstah> i cant recall
[12:15:46] <jugstah> i stopped using it
[12:20:58] <spobat> hi
[12:21:05] <spobat> is this also about twitter bootstrap?
[12:21:49] <spobat> I use $obj.popover({..., selector: 'img'}); but it only works for the first image i click - no matter which one that is
[12:21:53] <Cpudan80> RRR2: IE does not support CSS 3
[12:22:06] <spobat> that's weird. I want to open the same popover for > 30 images
[12:22:09] <spobat> > 30 img tags *
[12:22:18] <spobat> is that possible
[12:22:30] <RRR2> Cpudan80: it does, IE9 does at least
[12:22:38] <Cpudan80> err well IE7
[12:22:40] <Cpudan80> :-(
[12:22:46] <Cpudan80> *BARF*
[12:22:51] <RRR2> Cpudan80: of course it doesn't
[12:23:52] <spobat> drop all ie support :)
[12:24:04] <spobat> best decision of my life :<
[12:24:54] <duch_kazatel> spobat - IE9 and 10 aren't as bad as the old ones.  7 and 8 still suck though.
[12:25:14] <dopie> hello guys im trying to implement this
[12:25:17] <spobat> ie10 is on the technologically on the level of chrome 13
[12:25:19] <dopie> http://multiplethreads.wordpress.com/2013/04/09/image-upload-to-the-pagedown-markdown-editor-via-ajax-in-rails/
[12:25:24] <spobat> the current chrome version is 28.
[12:25:26] <dopie> where do i put the modal code?!
[12:25:27] <spobat> duh?
[12:25:30] <spobat> yeah, it sux
[12:26:01] * jugstah is away. Automatically set away [SZon]
[12:27:00] <snover> jugstah: you should turn off whatever script you have that emotes to the channel that you are away
[12:31:41] <jugstah> yeah sorry about that
[12:47:58] <qartex> hello, is anyone from the jquery team available? I'd like to ask a license question in private. thanks
[12:48:34] <snover> why in the world would you need to ask something like that in private?
[12:52:23] <qartex> snover: you're right. I have a jQuery Mobile plugin which uses the default jQuery Mobile themes. Since I don't want any naming conflict with the default jQuery Mobile CSS names, I have copied the jQuery Mobile style classes that I needed and renamed them. The plugin is in Github. Who can advice me about the licenses? Is that legal or I have to delete my plugin? Thanks in advance

[12:54:56] <vanev_> Yeah, my bad.
[12:55:23] <vanev_> Here's a link! https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/MIT-LICENSE.txt
[12:55:38] <Chousuke> hm, how does that requirement affect minifying javascript?
[12:56:08] <Chousuke> technically, it sounds like it would break the licence to distribute a minified source file with the licence header removed :/
[12:57:40] <snover> that’s why pretty much all code minifiers understand /*! for comments that need to remain unmodified
[12:57:50] <vanev_> snover: Totally correct.
[12:59:47] <Chousuke> snover: I suppose that would do it
[13:00:47] <qartex> so the whole plugin, even my custom files need to have the MIT license? (sorry for the noob questions)
[13:01:51] <louism2wash> Hey guys, is there a rule as far as accessing data from display as opposed to data attributes?  I have heard that the correct way to access data on the page is to set any needed values using data attributes as opposed to getting a value from say, inside a p tag.  Does anyone have any input?
[13:02:22] <duch_kazatel> louism2wash - it depends on if you inherited the codebase and how much flexibility/autonomy you have :)
[13:02:49] <vanev_> louism2wash: It
[13:03:05] <vanev_> 's usually cleaner to keep you data seperate from your display.
[13:03:12] <vanev_> Not always, but often.
[13:03:45] <louism2wash> duch_kazatel: I own the codebase so I can do whatever I please.  I am just wondering because I am running into an issue where I have a two copies of the same data.  One in data attributes and another in display attributes
[13:04:24] <louism2wash> duch_kazatel: just seems like an overhead concern at some point
[13:04:42] <duch_kazatel> louism2wash - I'd reccomend data attributes, but it depends on the case.
[13:13:15] <stack> hello, on what status codes does the promise .done get executed? is that for example on 204 ?
[13:23:54] <anli__> What I have extra body tags in my document?
[13:24:03] <anli__> body inside body
[13:25:03] <duch_kazatel> anli__ - that's not valid.
[13:33:51] <vanev_> anli__: You should not have body tags inside of your body.
[13:55:09] <qartex> snover:  vanev_: thank you both for your clarifications regarding the license
[14:03:24] <sayd> how do groups work with jquery.validate plugin? the docs seem to give a bad example
[14:03:52] <sayd> i can't seem to get any kind of insight into the group in the errorPlacement function
[14:09:43] <friedbyte> How can I prepend to an element that is getting its' class from addClass?
[14:10:22] <sayd> friedbyte: before() i think
[14:13:27] <friedbyte> .before() is doing the same thing as .prepend()
[14:17:30] <friedbyte> this probably will explain what I'm trying to do better http://jsfiddle.net/fUG4w/
[14:17:48] <friedbyte> for some reason .prepend isn't being applied
[14:19:36] <aljosa> is there something in jquery like $.post but for delete requests? $.delete?
[14:23:16] <shoky> aljosa: no. you can do it with $.ajax
[14:27:10] <Assimilater> wanting to make sure before i reinvent the wheel, there isn't an option on the tooltip to keep it visible as long as the mouse is either on the control or the tooltip, is there?
[14:27:53] <Assimilater> (for jquery ui's tooltip)
[14:46:08] <zizzl> I've seen numerous people ask this on here... I am using jQueryMobile and when I try to switch pages, the page breaks, in fact it adds the page I was trying to reach to the bottom of the HTML and I can scroll to it, and it looks terrible
[14:52:35] <doug65536> zizzl: jqm problem? wow, haven't heard that before :P
[14:52:42] <doug65536> jqm is very problematic :)
[14:53:07] <zizzl> doug65536 yeah I've tried everything, nothing is working, then when I saw it here I was stumped
[14:53:30] <doug65536> what do you mean "switch pages"
[14:53:37] <doug65536> go to a different page?
[14:53:42] <doug65536> different url?
[15:17:11] <nhulea> ugh i hate ie i just found out you can add display none to options
[15:17:37] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:18:17] <nhulea> <option style="display:none;"></option>
[15:18:46] <nhulea> cant* add
[15:39:40] <Kol> i have a pagination row using bootstrap's pagination component. how do i make it so when a page number is clicked, it edits the url's ?page=N value only and sends a new get request?
[15:39:49] <Kol> basically imitates a submit button
[15:39:58] <Kol> oh right i was gonna have it update a hidden input box and then somehow press submit
[15:40:06] <Kol> unless there's a better way?
[15:41:15] <duch_kazatel> Kol you can't do that in IE9 or below, but in everything else you have pushstates.
[15:41:33] <Kol> can't do what?
[15:42:03] <duch_kazatel> I assume you want to change part of the URL and submit an ajax request?
[15:42:10] <duch_kazatel> because that first part isn't possible in IE9 or below.
[15:42:19] <Kol> nah not ajax, just send a new get request
[15:42:25] <Kol> i.e. refresh the whole paeg
[15:42:29] <duch_kazatel> aaah.
[15:50:39] <sayd> inputs don't support :after or :before do they?
[15:54:57] <vacho> what's a good lightbox plugin for modern browsers that automatically resizes the image based on browser dimensions???????
[15:55:02] <mnewton> Hey guys, i have an ordered list, how do i scroll to the end of it
[16:03:10] <vacho> what's a good lightbox plugin for modern browsers that automatically resizes the image based on browser dimensions???????
[16:05:22] <duch_kazatel> vacho lightbox + some extra CSS to get it to do that?
[16:05:35] <duch_kazatel> or any of the 5 billion other modals out there.
[16:06:11] <vacho> duch_kazatel: u make it sound simple.
[16:06:36] <duch_kazatel> depending on what you mean by "based on browser dimensions", yeah.
[16:06:50] <vacho> duch_kazatel: if it was that simple, it would come as default :)
[16:07:04] <duch_kazatel> erm, no it wouldn't, because stretching images like that is ugly.
[16:07:24] <vacho> duch_kazatel: image resize that's proportional man..cmon
[16:07:38] <duch_kazatel> you mean like a fixed percentage of the browser?
[16:07:44] <vacho> duch_kazatel: you must be turkish
[16:07:51] <duch_kazatel> uh, nope.
[16:08:48] <duch_kazatel> why would you say that?
[16:09:14] <grafi> anyone in here have a macbook pro 13inch retina ?
[16:13:19] <vacho> what's a good lightbox plugin for modern browsers that automatically resizes the image based on browser dimensions???????
[16:13:50] <duch_kazatel> vacho - you mean like a specific percentage of the height/width of the browser window?  because it's really not that hard.
[16:13:55] <duch_kazatel> just takes some CSS.
[16:18:33] <jned> can we set a cookie?
[16:18:46] <duch_kazatel> jned yes you can.
[16:18:56] <jned> How can we set a cookie?
[16:19:52] <duch_kazatel> jned - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1458724/how-to-set-unset-cookie-with-jquery
[16:20:04] <jned> duch_kazatel, thx
[16:22:24] <xp_prg> how can hide multiple divs with the same id?
[16:22:39] <jned> Uncaught TypeError: Object function (e,t){return new x.fn.init(e,t,r)} has no method 'cookie'
[16:23:18] <duch_kazatel> xp_prg you cannot have multiple divs with the same id.
[16:23:20] <duch_kazatel> that's invalid.
[16:23:46] <xp_prg> this page does, they are nested in a parent div with a different id, does that make it legal?
[16:23:57] <jned> xp_prg you are supposed to use class in that case, that 101
[16:24:07] <duch_kazatel> xp_prg - nope the ID should be unique to the whole page.
[16:24:25] <xp_prg> so jquery can't even find the other divs?
[16:24:45] <Kol> how do i select the element with class="active" whose parent is class="pagination"
[16:25:28] <obert> .pagination .active {} ?
[16:25:56] <jned> when I search cookie on api.jquery.com I don't see any results, it show me .change() instead
[16:26:23] <jned> I am using jquery 1.10
[16:26:37] <duch_kazatel> jned - you need to setup a new plugin.
[16:26:50] <duch_kazatel> and xp_prg - it can "find" them, but you need to fix the page, otherwise yopu'll have other problems.
[16:26:57] <jned> duch_kazatel, what do you mean, cookie is out? what are they using instead?
[16:27:03] <duch_kazatel> and Kol $('.pagination .active');
[16:27:10] <duch_kazatel> jned - there isn't a cookie library.
[16:27:17] <duch_kazatel> err, rather, it's not standard to jquery.
[16:27:19] <obert> hehe indeed
[16:27:19] <duch_kazatel> you need a plugin.
[16:28:02] <jned> oh ok, guess I'll do it in javascript instead then
[16:28:13] <duch_kazatel> lol kay\
[16:28:23] <jned> http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp
[16:28:29] <jned> dunno why jquery didn't include it
[16:28:39] <duch_kazatel> don't use w3schools btw.
[16:28:49] <duch_kazatel> jned - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1458724/how-to-set-unset-cookie-with-jquery
[16:28:54] <duch_kazatel> that has a pure javascript version on it.
[16:29:02] <duch_kazatel> why not just use a plugin, though?
[16:29:15] <jned> duch_kazatel, don't mind a plugin, you have a link by chance?
[16:29:20] <xp_prg> ok, I want to select a classname y with id x, what is the selector?  $('.y #x') ?
[16:29:28] <jned> duch_kazatel, was thinking about overhead though
[16:29:33] <duch_kazatel> the stack overflow link i provided has exactly that, jned.
[16:29:38] <Kol> how do i add 1 to "1" in jquery?
[16:29:42] <Kol> or javascript, rather
[16:29:50] <duch_kazatel> and xp_prg - $('#someId.aClass');
[16:29:56] <Kol> do i have to declare a separate variable? because doing + 1 concatenates it instead
[16:29:58] <xp_prg> the class is first
[16:30:04] <duch_kazatel> Kol - you have to parseint on 1.
[16:30:25] <xp_prg> the class is the parent and the children found by search for that class have the id I want
[16:30:27] <duch_kazatel> xp_prg - what? "the classname is first"?
[16:30:34] <jned> duch_kazatel, thx, you have a link for the plugin too please?
[16:30:41] <xp_prg> should I use a foreach?
[16:30:51] <duch_kazatel> jned - ... the stack overflow page contains links....
[16:31:29] <duch_kazatel> xp_prg what are you trying to do again?
[16:31:38] <duch_kazatel> why not select by ID?
[16:31:46] <xp_prg> because the id is not unique :(
[16:31:51] <duch_kazatel> then you have to change it to be.
[16:31:55] <xp_prg> there are multiple divs with the same id
[16:31:59] <xp_prg> I can't :(
[16:32:03] <duch_kazatel> why not?
[16:32:10] <xp_prg> its a legacy system
[16:32:50] <duch_kazatel> lol that's a reall strange reason.  if you have uniquely classed parents (which doesn't make sense), you can select like $('.parentClass #myId');
[16:32:51] <duch_kazatel> maybe.,
[16:33:16] <jned> is undefined a type too, as in I can use === tripple equality to test for it?
[16:33:40] <duch_kazatel> jned why do you ask?
[16:33:53] <duch_kazatel> are you testing to see if it's undefined?
[16:33:55] <jned> cause I think it better to use it when you can
[16:34:05] <jned> yeah, like if cookie is set
[16:34:13] <xp_prg> ok thanks
[16:34:35] <duch_kazatel> jned you want to use typeof variable_here === 'undefined'
[16:34:42] <Technical_13> Isn't there an isSet() that would be better?
[16:35:00] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:35:04] <duch_kazatel> there is in PHP
[16:35:23] <Technical_13> Ahh.  That must be what I'm thinking of.
[16:35:50] <duch_kazatel> and there's no need for it anyway, since it's easy to check in raw JS :)
[16:35:54] <Kol> if 2 click events are triggered at once, and one of them has return false;, how do i make it so the other one is triggered first?
[16:36:09] <duch_kazatel> why are you attaching 2 events at the same time?
[16:36:21] <duch_kazatel> why not run one then callback to the other?
[16:36:46] <Kol> errr what does that mean :d
[16:37:17] <duch_kazatel> have one even call the other when it completes.
[16:37:24] <duch_kazatel> what're the functions doing?
[16:38:09] <Kol> well it's for pagination - i have prev, numbers, and ... buttons. some of them will be disabled at certain times and they all link to # but i want to prevent the browser from actually going to # so i need to return false;
[16:38:34] <duch_kazatel> why are you preventing it?
[16:38:46] <Kol> because it's messing with my tabs on refresh
[16:38:46] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to prevent the default behavior of the links?
[16:39:13] <Kol> yeah, i tried to search for better ways to do it but couldn't find much
[16:39:21] <duch_kazatel> have a jsfiddle to show that you've got?
[16:39:30] <duch_kazatel> because i'll bet it's easier than you think.
[16:40:04] <Kol> sec i'll make one
[16:42:16] <xp_prg> ok if I search for a class can I be sure the order that the results come back are sequential on the page if you will?
[16:42:36] <duch_kazatel> xp_prg err, maybe?  depends.
[16:42:38] <xp_prg> like I won't get the 4th one before the 1st one etc..
[16:42:50] <duch_kazatel> do you have access to the source code of the page with the dupe IDs?
[16:42:58] <duch_kazatel> because you should really change that...
[16:43:12] <xp_prg> *sigh* I found a way to do it
[16:43:37] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[16:43:59] <xp_prg> I can search for the class, it returns the duplicated id divs, then I can hide them
[16:44:07] <xp_prg> my question is if the divs come back in order or not
[16:44:22] <duch_kazatel> that's not fixing the problem, and you could maybe make the assumption, but it's not guaranteed.
[16:44:32] <xp_prg> ok
[16:47:22] <Kol> duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/W9rkj/
[16:47:52] <duch_kazatel> Kol - yeah, you're doing this wrong :) sec.
[16:48:09] <Kol> the disabled and active classes are used in bootstrap, npage i put myself in server-side code so i could detect 'em in jquery
[16:49:17] <duch_kazatel> kol are you just trying to figure out which page number was clicked?
[16:49:22] <duch_kazatel> what's up with the input?
[16:49:37] <Kol> i want it to be sent in a GET query
[16:49:45] <Kol> i have to add more script to simulate a submit button
[16:50:02] <duch_kazatel> nah don't worry about it.
[16:50:34] <duch_kazatel> wait why are you submitting this form?  just to change pages?
[16:50:45] <Kol> among various other things
[16:51:00] <duch_kazatel> hrm, that's strange.  either way.
[16:51:00] <Kol> different search filters and whatnot
[16:51:10] <Kol> i just need my project to be very 'linkable'
[16:51:11] <duch_kazatel> is this going to be visible to the end user?
[16:51:22] <duch_kazatel> the input i mean.
[16:51:22] <Kol> is what?
[16:51:28] <Kol> no i'll hide it
[16:51:37] <duch_kazatel> then don't use it :3
[16:51:53] <duch_kazatel> you can craft the URLs on the links - if there's no ajax going on, you don't need to use the input.
[16:52:13] <Kol> will it take the data from the other forms on my page too?
[16:52:58] <duch_kazatel> wat.  your entire setup sounds really really odd to me.
[16:53:13] <duch_kazatel> either way - you should look at using the .on() method instead of .click, and look at event delegation.
[16:53:42] <Kol> yeah it's quite odd
[16:53:52] <duch_kazatel> let me craft a quick example.
[16:54:06] <Kol> i would have rather done it all in POST but linkability is essential and i didn't feel like hashing the options or whatever
[16:54:35] <duch_kazatel> is there any ajax on the page?
[16:54:39] <Kol> nope
[16:54:47] <Kol> i wouldn't be prepared for that headache
[16:55:04] <duch_kazatel> then you don't need to hash - just have the server respond to the correct QSPs.  either way one moment.

[17:01:05] <duch_kazatel> this is bugged but illustrates the idea: http://jsfiddle.net/W9rkj/4/
[17:01:07] <duch_kazatel> aaaaand brb
[17:03:38] <grafi> [01:51:08] <Kol> i just need my project to be very 'linkable' << does that mean concise urls or everything settable via get params? ^^
[17:04:21] <Kol> the latter
[17:04:32] <Kol> probably should've cleared that up :p
[17:07:43] <jned> This is ok, or is there a better way:  if(typeof $.cookie('usernameCookie') !== 'undefined') username = $.cookie('usernameCookie');  ?
[17:08:53] <grafi> jned does that work ôo
[17:09:08] <jned> obviously
[17:11:27] <grafi> hm
[17:11:31] <duch_kazatel> jned - look into using a ternary operator.
[17:12:17] <jned> duch_kazatel, hehe, yeah thats what I wanted it
[17:12:30] <duch_kazatel> simplifies stuff like that, just don't abuse it ;)
[17:13:31] <grafi> so cookie returns undefined then you "cast" that to a string and check against "undefined", wouldnt $.cookie() !== undefined work the same?
[17:14:34] <duch_kazatel> grafi sometimes your program flow is to chekc and set it if it isn't all ready.
[17:14:39] <duch_kazatel> if it IS set, continue on per normal.
[17:15:22] <grafi> does that make a difference?
[17:15:39] <grafi> typeof will only return "undefined" when you pass it undefined, no?
[17:15:54] <duch_kazatel> errr, what?
[17:16:12] <duch_kazatel> to catch and set if not all ready, otherwise continue?
[17:16:55] <grafi> to refactor the code jned posted
[17:16:57] <grafi> oô
[17:17:53] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:18:09] <grafi> confusion ^^
[17:18:32] <linusoleander> I'm looking for an event on an input field for when a text has been selected predefined by the browser
[17:18:34] <duch_kazatel> you're not making sense.
[17:19:12] <grafi> im just wondering if if(typeof $.cookie('usernameCookie') !== 'undefined') does the same as $.cookie('usernameCookie') !== undefined
[17:19:25] <snover> yes.
[17:20:17] <linusoleander> duch_kazatel: If you type something in Chrome, a drop down list with a predefined value are shown. Is there an event that's called when a user selects that value`?
[17:21:01] <duch_kazatel> linusoleander - look here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4938242/browser-autofill-and-javascript-triggered-events
[17:21:35] <jned> so I should use the typeof or no?
[17:21:39] <snover> no
[17:22:13] <linusoleander> duch_kazatel: Thanks
[17:22:22] <snover> typeof is only good for suppressing ReferenceErrors when you are trying to find a global variable without directly referencing the global object
[17:22:33] <snover> in this situations
[17:22:50] <jned> snover, thx
[17:26:00] <rfk> Has anyone used DataTables? I'd just like to get rid of the search bar, LIMIT clause, etc on the top and bottom since it is a particularly small/minimal table
[17:30:25] <jned>  $.cookie('usernameCookie') != undefined OR  $.cookie('usernameCookie') != 'undefined'
[17:30:40] <grafi> undefined without the ''
[17:31:27] <jned> grafi, thx, you sure? you have the knowledge and experience or are you just guessing?
[17:32:07] <grafi> I know that anything that is not defined yet is undefined and not a string saying 'undefined'
[17:32:58] <rfk> haha
[17:42:34] <clime> hey, with jqery-ui dialog, is it possible to get dialog object itself on which I could call its methods directly? E.g. dialog.open() instead of dialogElem.dialog('open')
[17:47:06] <clime> ok i see, dialog is not an object but function there.
[17:47:34] <clime> and the object itself if even exists is really well hidden
[17:47:37] <duch_kazatel> Clime - all functions are objects.
[17:47:55] <clime> ye but objects are not functions
[17:47:58] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[17:48:34] <clime> well, that was not to the point what i said
[17:48:55] <clime> i mean there is not a dialog object with functions like open close etc
[17:49:01] <clime> at least i could not find it
[17:49:16] <clime> only the function that is applied on stuff like "open", "close" etc
[17:52:19] <clime> ok i guess, ill go with a bit more typing

[18:46:01] <NCS_One> hi
[18:46:10] <NCS_One> anyone know a good workaround for the IE lack of the mothod "form" of "input" element?
[18:46:52] <tw2113> huh
[19:19:23] <sayd> heh
[19:19:36] <sayd> NCS_One: rephrase that plz
[19:21:31] <sayd> element.form should exist
[19:31:22] <NCS_One> sayd: '<form id="myform" ...> some inputs </form>' in another place '<input type="submit" form="myform" />'
[19:38:35] <nesoi> to find the vertical size of an element, what's the correct method? I tried .outerHeight and it reports less than the actual height as shown in chrome's element inspector
[19:39:17] <garbagecollectio> in javascript isn't there a constructor function that gets called when the object is instantiated
[19:49:13] <nesoi> anyone here good with css and jqm?
[19:56:35] <nesoi> how do I determine the length of a listview in pixels?
[19:59:11] <nesoi> I want to scroll to the end of it, but silentScroll requires a pixel to scroll to, so I need to determine the length of the listview in pixels to scroll to the end. Or at least that's what it seems I have to do.
[19:59:54] <chenglou> anyone here have time to explain a small section of jquery's internals?
[20:00:04] <fezziwig> Hello out there!  I am a noob, trying to implement this plugin:  http://www.jainaewen.com/files/javascript/jquery/equal-height-columns.html ... I have it working locally, but I don't know how to get the script to load when the page loads, rather than when you click the "apply equal columns" links... Help?
[20:04:45] <chenglou> fezziwig: try $.ready()
[20:05:13] <chenglou> or you could just place your script in the <body>, after everything's been loaded
[20:07:05] <fezziwig> chenglou thanks, I'll try that!
[20:07:16] <chenglou> fezziwig: np
[20:08:24] <fezziwig> chenglou : I just need to figure out which function to fire on ready!
[20:09:17] <chenglou> fezziwig: a brief look at the api says it's $(selector).equalHeightColumns();
[20:09:59] <chenglou> fezziwig: basically, just check whatever the page used for their click event to resize columns, and call that manually
[20:17:41] <fezziwig> chenglou, I am such a noob!
[20:18:42] <chenglou> fezziwig: haha it's no trouble, just keep learning =)
[20:19:00] <fezziwig> I am confused, as I don't see an onClick event
[20:19:59] <chenglou> fezziwig: sorry I was talking theoretically, about the source code on the page
[20:20:28] <chenglou> fezziwig: it's unrealistic for me to tell you to dig inside to find what function the click event triggers
[20:20:54] <chenglou> anyway, the method you want is yourElement.equalHeightColumns()
[20:21:03] <fezziwig> ah, ok
[20:21:10] <chenglou> and you put your whole code in a $.ready()
[20:21:23] <chenglou> which will only execute once jquery detects that your page is loaded
[20:22:09] <fezziwig> but is "yourElement" the div id?
[22:27:21] <garbagecollectio> can i do this
[22:27:22] <garbagecollectio> ContactDetailsCompose.prototype = new ContactDetails(this);
[22:43:37] <fezziwig> chenglou, are you still around?
[23:05:57] <fezziwig> can anyone take a quick look at this script and tell me what looks.... wrong?  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/eacf20ba639f570a8a54
[23:08:30] <grafi> equalHeihgtColumns() exists? somewhere?
[23:09:48] <grafi> fezziwig ^
[23:10:12] <fezziwig> grafi - yes, in an included js file
[23:10:28] <fezziwig> this is basically what I am trying to use: http://www.jainaewen.com/files/javascript/jquery/equal-height-columns.html
[23:10:50] <grafi> and what seems to be the problem?
[23:11:11] <fezziwig> well, it doesn't seem to be doing anything...
[23:11:50] <fezziwig> either the function isn't running at all, or I have my selector wrong...
[23:11:54] <grafi> any errors?
[23:12:06] <fezziwig> no, console sez nothing
[23:12:07] <amirite> is there a built-in jquery method for updating a jquery object by reselecting the initial selector
[23:12:13] <grafi> always good to take a look into the javascript console/devtools
[23:12:32] <tw2113> devtools rule
