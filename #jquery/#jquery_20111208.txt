[00:00:17] <Cork> lyrae: it should, but anyway don't use the global name scope
[00:00:30] <Cork> there is a dedicated scope for attributes you invent your self
[00:00:41] <Cork> data-<your attribute name>
[00:01:06] <varnie> I am trying to change class in the button's click handler, but it doesn't change it. what am I doing wrong? here's the code: "jQuery(".tb_tarif_country th.col1").removeClass('col1').addClass('col1_no_borders');"
[00:01:43] <varnie> but if I execute that line directly into firebux console the class will be changed
[00:02:11] <codeho> did you try to first add the class then remove the other?
[00:02:28] <codeho> also it'll be faster if you use filter()
[00:02:53] <varnie> one moment please...
[00:04:05] <varnie> still doesn't work
[00:05:25] <Jawsome> Super Noob Question: Is it possible to do an AJAX call within the success of an AJAX call?
[00:07:33] <codeho> Jawsome: yes
[00:08:02] <codeho> Jawsome: just create another function that does an ajax call and call it after success
[00:08:27] <codeho> varnie: can you create a jsfiddle with your code?
[00:08:45] <lyrae> Cork which scope
[00:08:48] <varnie> I will try
[00:09:09] <lyrae> please elaborate
[00:09:39] <Zogot> Ahoy
[00:09:48] <Jawsome> Thank you very much Codeho.
[00:10:11] <codeho> np
[00:10:18] <codeho> lyrae: http://api.jquery.com/data/
[00:10:37] <prodn> how can I post all form data with $.post() without specifying which input fields? I don't want to do "postal_code = $("#myform").find('input[name="postal_code"]').val(); for every value
[00:10:57] <codeho> prodn: submit() ?
[00:11:21] <prodn> and the ajax part?
[00:11:31] <codeho> oj sorry
[00:11:33] <prodn> $.post();
[00:12:32] <Zogot> Could do an each statement for the form > inputs
[00:12:37] <Zogot> but can't say ive ever tried it
[00:12:43] <codeho> you do .submit(function(e).. on the form and then $.post(form.attr('action'), form.serialize(), function(json) {.....
[00:13:07] <codeho> and then of course e.preventDefault();
[00:13:14] <prodn> mm
[00:13:25] <prodn> what does this mean? $.post("test.php", $("#testform").serialize());
[00:13:28] <lyrae> codeho: in order to do this, when i load the html, i have to use data to each element i wanna retrieve such information form?
[00:13:31] <prodn> I don't know about the serialize part...
[00:13:47] <codeho> it will create a json string out of your form fields
[00:14:01] <codeho> and pass it onto the post
[00:14:18] <codeho> http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[00:14:47] <prodn> thanks
[00:14:52] <codeho> sure
[00:15:33] <codeho> lyrae: you have to set and retrieve this for the elements you want the data stored in
[00:16:10] <codeho> if those are going to be a lot, you might want to consider doing it another way completely, what exactly are you trying to do
[00:16:14] <lyrae> alright let me try
[00:21:21] <Tomashe> HEY GUYS
[00:21:23] <Tomashe> ANYONE ARROUND?
[00:22:02] <Cork> Tomashe: lose the caps
[00:22:04] <Tomashe> http://www.arnir.dreamax.co.il/Cetifications < anyone have any idea why the colorbox doesnt work in I
[00:22:06] <lyrae> whats the function called again so newly created elements become registered with the DOM and i can traverse them
[00:22:12] <lyrae> live() is it?
[00:22:14] <Tomashe> IE*
[00:22:28] <Tomashe> yes live
[00:22:34] <codeho> lyrae: it is
[00:22:46] <lyrae> thank you
[00:22:48] <Tomashe> live('click', function(){}) for example
[00:23:07] <Cork> lyrae: live will catch future elements, it doesn't register them in the dom
[00:23:34] <lyrae> Ye
[00:23:35] <Tomashe> anyone can check my issue looks like the colorbox doesnt work on the images on my link on IE
[00:23:36] <lyrae> Yes*
[00:23:58] <Tomashe> i created wrap() on page load to wrap with links the images
[00:24:33] <Tomashe> its working perfectly on FF but not in IE :/;.
[00:25:16] <codeho> i think its what he meant. once the new element is in the dom and you want to find it through an event you have to make the eventListener using live()
[00:25:29] <lyrae> it is
[00:26:29] <Tomashe> anyone can check my issue
[00:26:55] <Cork> Tomashe: could you define "doesn't work"?
[00:27:21] <Cork> and what version of ie?
[00:28:15] <Tomashe> open it on IE
[00:28:19] <Tomashe> and click on the images and see
[00:28:23] <Tomashe> the colorbox isnt opening
[00:28:27] <Cork> ya, works fine
[00:28:59] <Cork> so what version of ie?
[00:29:43] <Tomashe> 7
[00:29:44] <Tomashe> 8
[00:29:47] <Liquide> little stupid here, what is the easiest way to make a callback that just returns an elements properties back default (what they had before I changed them via an action)
[00:29:50] <Cork> ok
[00:29:51] <Tomashe> both it doesnt work
[00:30:00] * Cork starts an old version of ie
[00:30:01] <Tomashe> so what u think?
[00:30:20] <Cork> need an older version so one min
[00:31:23] <varnie> thank you for the help. I found the bug.
[00:32:04] <varnie> in the button's click handler I have a jQuery.post and into its 3rd parameter (i.e. in the handler) I tried to change the class nme
[00:32:29] <lyrae> and thanks codeho_away  .data() made it work fine. Although i still think attr() is more elegant and easier to follow and less cumbersome. but whatever works
[00:32:37] <varnie> in short, the page reloads in that .post handler, so, the changes of class name reset.
[00:33:17] <Cork> Tomashe: nope nothing pops out at me
[00:33:40] <Tomashe> yep
[00:33:45] <Tomashe> and i dont reallyt knows why
[00:33:45] <Cork> Tomashe: you've run the code through something like jslint or jshint?
[00:33:57] <Tomashe> nop only firebug
[00:34:01] <Tomashe> didnt find any bugs
[00:34:09] <Tomashe> what is jshint
[00:34:10] <Cork> either the plugin isn't optimized for for old broken ie's
[00:34:18] <Cork> Tomashe: an alternative to jslint
[00:34:38] <Cork> or ie's parser doesn't like something in your code
[00:35:19] <Tomashe> hmm yes but how can i know what it is
[00:35:40] <Cork> jslint or jslint should give you a hint
[00:35:48] <Cork> it often does
[00:35:57] <Tomashe> but its not a plugin
[00:36:05] <Tomashe> i should paste the entire code there?
[00:36:15] <Cork> the entire js code, yes
[00:36:39] <Cork> Tomashe: another tip is to grab the none minimized versions of the plugins
[00:36:49] <Cork> that often helps debugging wierd problems
[00:37:35] <Tomashe> ok i wil lcheck this out
[00:39:05] <Tomashe> i will try to uncommpressed first
[00:39:07] <Cork> lyrae: there isn't much difference between data .attr and .data
[00:39:35] <Cork> lyrae: if you create <span data-id="1"></span>, you can select it with $('span').data('id')
[00:39:43] <Cork> so i don't see the difference at all
[00:40:20] <lyrae> well i had <span num="1">
[00:40:29] <lyrae> then i tried attr() to set it to 2, it wasn't working
[00:40:41] <dogcat> i'm relatively new to jquery and have a slider i need to edit. can someone recommend where i can get some personal help?
[00:41:24] <Tomashe> still the same
[00:41:30] <Tomashe> with uncompressed
[00:42:01] <Cork> lyrae: ya, but the only difference is you add data- infront of the attribute name
[00:42:05] <sahbeewah> .data doesn't create an attr with data-*
[00:42:18] <Cork> ya, but it reads them
[00:42:34] <sahbeewah> does it?
[00:42:37] <lyrae> but i needed to write to them
[00:42:39] <Cork> yes
[00:42:42] <prodn> http://jsfiddle.net/RjgKL/4/ - dealing with $.post() and such. Is here a syntax error or what? Why wont it work past the $.submit()?
[00:42:56] <Cork> lyrae: but does it have to be put in the dom?
[00:42:57] <lyrae> since i clone()'d the span...then needed to change num='1 to num='2'
[00:43:01] <lyrae> yes
[00:43:17] <Cork> and $(clone).data isn't enolugh?
[00:43:22] <Cork> *enough
[00:43:31] <lyrae> it probably is
[00:43:50] * Cork still has a hard time seeing the problem...
[00:44:20] <lyrae> there isn't one :)
[00:46:04] <codeho> quite some traffic here..
[00:49:30] <Tomashe> Cork http://www.jslint.com/ how do i add jquery here ?
[00:49:35] <prodn> did anyone see my q 7 mins ago?
[00:49:38] <Tomashe> just paste the entire code
[00:49:39] <Tomashe> ?
[00:51:10] <lyrae> so Cor
[00:52:40] <lyrae> Cork*. i am trying <span data-num='2'>. I cloned it with $('span').clone() it, and i can retrieve the data..i alert it and its' 1. but how do i change the data?
[00:54:21] <codeho> prodn: looking at it now
[00:54:29] <fortysixandtwo> $('span').clone().attr('data-num', 4); ?
[00:55:55] <codeho> prodn: there's no submit button?
[00:56:21] <Cork> lyrae: http://jsfiddle.net/ep7wP/
[00:57:07] <prodn> codeho: there is a span with the class "edit", and when clicked, it triggers the form submit()?
[00:57:16] <codeho> prodn: you're not triggering the submit
[00:57:20] <codeho> you're just listening for it
[00:57:24] <codeho> you first have to trigger it
[00:57:47] <prodn> I see
[00:57:49] <codeho> $("#form_"+id).submit();
[00:57:59] <fortysixandtwo> Cork: data and DOM-attr data-* is not the same thing
[00:58:13] <codeho> then put the submit handler outside the click event listener into a listening function
[00:58:32] <Cork> fortysixandtwo: true, but as i've already said, data- is imported into .data when you load the dom
[00:58:59] <Cork> fortysixandtwo: so data- is the same as .data but .data isn't the same as data-
[01:02:26] <fortysixandtwo> Cork: And you we're not the guy who had problems with data. Sorry, I should'nt have jumped the discussion without reading it all :\
[01:02:59] <donCams> found out this works http://pastebin.com/LyqHgffk lmao! but is it any way correct?
[01:03:41] <donCams> i mean a self initiating anonymous function assigned to a namespace variable?
[01:04:11] <phrearch> hey
[01:05:19] <varnie> is it possible to prevent a button from gets clicked multiple times?
[01:05:44] <Zogot> varnie : remove the class that triggers the event would be a simple solution
[01:05:47] <Zogot> on the click
[01:07:05] <Zogot> donCams: this is what i do http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/KgXkY/
[01:07:09] <Zogot> not sure if its the right way either
[01:08:32] <Zogot> A cart is one I use it for, cart.ready calls the widget function, and assigns the listeners to the buttons for doing the ajax stuff
[01:10:09] <donCams> Zogot, yes... just wondering if I assign a self-invoking anon func if it can be called again somewhere
[01:11:45] <varnie> I changed the buttons' id to '' but it is still invokes many times
[01:12:44] <lyrae> Cork..trying to mimic your kind, sorta. http://paste.plurk.com/show/787798/ i get NULL when i alert 'num'. any thoughts?
[01:13:03] <lyrae> i know it is selecting the right element because if i alert .attr('class'), it alerts the class name
[01:13:20] <lyrae> aka , 'e'
[01:13:55] <donCams> varnie, i don't know how to do it. but if it were me, i'll add a class then i'll check if $('#buttonID').is('disabled') { //don't do stuff } else { // do stuff }
[01:14:18] <donCams> i mean .is('.disabled')
[01:14:39] <donCams> then if i want to enable it again, i'll just .removeClass('disabled')
[01:14:40] <varnie> I see
[01:15:02] <donCams> that's how I would do it. don't know if it's correct :3
[01:15:43] <varnie> the same can do just a simple boolean flag variable
[01:16:27] <donCams> yes. but if you have lots of buttons
[01:17:52] <donCams> $('.specificButtonClass').click(function() { $(this).addClass('disabled'); });
[01:19:07] <Arcano_23> Hi all,
[01:19:19] <risky_s> hi
[01:19:33] <risky_s> how do I retrieve values from a multidimensional associative array?
[01:20:08] <Arcano_23> I use return false; to stop any link forwarding when I catch the click event on <a>, however I've noticed that this doesn't work for buttons that have a onclick='..' set that is forwarding to somewhere else?how can I do this? thanks
[01:20:41] <donCams> Arcano_23, $('button').click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); });
[01:21:46] <Arcano_23> donCams, does that work when the button is like this: <input type="button" value="APPROVE" onclick="location.href='/pr/approve/913648';">
[01:21:56] <Arcano_23> donCams, notice that it has a location.href..
[01:22:20] <Arcano_23> I've noticed that the browser stills forward no matter what I do from the jury side
[01:22:50] <lyrae> like, what happens if data-something already comes in the dom
[01:23:24] <donCams> first: tias, second: why are you still using onclick inline?
[01:23:42] <Trisox> oldschool
[01:23:46] <Arcano_23> What I am basically seeking, is showing a confirm button i order to ask when to proceed, the problem with buttons is that when the confirm dialog shows up, the forward is perfumed n
[01:24:10] <donCams> e.preventDefault() would do the trick.. hmmm..
[01:24:27] <Arcano_23> donCams, ok, let me try it,
[01:24:35] <Zogot> arcano_23: make sure you put the e in the () on the function call
[01:24:45] <donCams> yes :)
[01:26:23] <Arcano_23> Zogot, I'm coding now this and trying in Chrome and Firefox
[01:29:37] <Arcano_23> it doesn't work, no matter what you answer to the confirm dialog, the forward is performed
[01:30:00] <Zogot> put your js in jsfiddle
[01:30:03] <Zogot> so we can see :)
[01:30:07] <Arcano_23> ok
[01:31:52] <Arcano_23> http://jsfiddle.net/3xhDd/
[01:32:08] <Arcano_23> well, I've just our there the input, which is part of a big HTML page
[01:35:16] <pollycrack> does anyone know how to modify the jquery cycle plugin? i need some help with it using it as a slider.
[01:36:20] <Arcano_23> Zogot, have you found any error?
[01:36:24] <MrBenn> pollycrack, what are you trying to achieve?
[01:39:26] <pollycrack> mrbenn, i need to modify the slider so that aside from showing the main image in focus, you can see about ~200px to the left and right of this main image to preview both the next and previous image slides as well. this ~200px would essentially be a translucent next/previous button area.
[01:40:04] <Arcano_23> So I think the in line on click even is not compatible with the query .click one, right? that is the problem?
[01:43:34] <beasty> morning all
[01:43:41] <beasty> anyone has expierence with namespaces ?
[01:44:11] <beasty> cause i have a namespace in a .js file
[01:44:31] <MrBenn> pollycrack, you'd have to do something like make the view area wider to expose the slides and then absolutely position two eleements with transparency over the areas you wanted
[01:44:33] <beasty> and when i want to call it from my html it says it's undefined
[01:45:21] <codeho_> Arcano: instead of using on click, i'd add the path as data and then only send the user there once you checked for the yes/no selection
[01:46:49] <pollycrack> mrbenn, right, that sounds correct, thanks. how do i expand the view area to be wider? i've been combing through the cycle code to see how it determines the width of the slider, which i assume is based upon the width of the individual image in focus.
[01:47:20] <beasty> http://jsfiddle.net/GuRwu/
[01:47:24] <beasty> this is the jsfiddle
[01:47:44] <MrBenn> pollycrack read the documentation for it I'm pretty sure it says all that stuff on there
[01:48:44] <pollycrack> mrbenn, trust me, i have been! :)  i feel like this is somewhat over my head b/c i cannot find what i need. i'm still trying to get over my learning curve for jquery in general.
[01:49:13] <MrBenn> It should be done in you CSS
[01:49:41] <MrBenn> all widths and heights should be determined there, Cycle just works around them I think
[01:49:58] <MrBenn> beasty
[01:50:44] <MrBenn> http://jsfiddle.net/ScVR5/
[01:50:47] <MrBenn> try that
[01:51:02] <pollycrack> hmm, okay. the only other problem i need to figure out is overwriting the display:none style that's applied to inactive slides. i also think that's controlled by cycle, am i wrong?
[01:51:16] <MrBenn> That is
[01:53:38] <Arcano_23> does window.location=''; forward to a page?
[01:54:10] <Cork> yes
[01:54:44] <pollycrack> what doesn't make sense about the width is that a specific width is not declared in the CSS. I've looked for the specific px number but it doesn't exist. It appears to be dynamically determined and then inserted by the cycle plugin to the parent div.
[01:55:25] <Pupeno> Is Learning jQuery 3rd Edition a good way to learn jQuery nowadays?
[01:56:06] <Zogot> ?jqueryfundamentals
[01:56:07] <bot-t> Zogot, Episode 34 - The Official jQuery Podcast - Episode 34 http://podcast.jquery.com/2010/09/17/episode-34-karl-swedberg-part-2/
[01:56:26] <Pupeno> A jquery podcast? cool!
[01:56:38] <Zogot> that wasn't what i wanted to link to :p
[01:56:59] <Zogot> http://jqfundamentals.com/ thats what i used
[01:58:24] <Pupeno> Zogot: If that was meant to meâ€¦ yeah, I bet there's a lot of online information; but if there's a good jquery book, I want my company to buy it.
[01:59:33] <pollycrack> mrbenn is there someone i could personally ask for help or maybe pay to help me with this? i understand what you've suggested but it's not easy for me to accomplish.
[01:59:36] <ajaxbud> hi buddies..I need to post  a set of form elements using jquery to my php file
[01:59:44] <ajaxbud> I'm trying to use $.post
[01:59:59] <ajaxbud> the problem is my php file doesnt receive the appropriate data that I send
[02:00:17] <ajaxbud> I tried $(#formelement).serilaize()
[02:00:32] <ajaxbud> on CLient side Javascript alert shows me the serialized result
[02:00:39] <ajaxbud> but how do I handle it in PHP
[02:00:47] <ajaxbud> I am using it in the following form:
[02:01:05] <ajaxbud> term = $(this).serialize()
[02:01:17] <skrubis> Hey, could someone take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/Wcvgm/
[02:01:18] <ajaxbud> and then $.post( 'otherinfo.php',  {data:term});
[02:01:41] <ajaxbud> in my php  file I do unserialize($_POST['data'])
[02:01:46] <skrubis> I want to fix the third slider to set border radius on div "vaaks"
[02:02:00] <ajaxbud> Am I doing the right thing?
[02:02:57] <ravenzz> ?ajax @ ajaxbud
[02:02:58] <bot-t> ajaxbud, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[02:03:31] <Tomashe> Cork
[02:03:32] <ravenzz> + debugging
[02:03:36] <Tomashe> ravenzz
[02:03:48] <ravenzz> :?
[02:04:09] <Tomashe> http://www.arnir.dreamax.co.il/Cetifications < the lightbox on those images isnt opening in IE7-8 any idea why. i tried few tools to check but could found it
[02:06:03] <Tomashe> i created a code tat wrap that image with <a> so the colorbox will work and after that intialize the colorbox trigger
[02:06:16] <Arcano_23> Working like a charm here :)
[02:06:55] <Tomashe> $(".CBCOLORBOX img").each(function(){		var img=$(this).attr("src");		$(this).wrap('<a href="'+img+'">');		});	$(".CBCOLORBOX a").colorbox();
[02:06:58] <ravenzz> not on IE
[02:07:01] <ravenzz> Arcano_23 ^
[02:07:02] <Tomashe> work perfectly on FF
[02:07:31] <Arcano_23> ravenzz, he he he, that's true my firend
[02:07:42] <ravenzz> I never use colorbox
[02:08:03] <Arcano_23> ravenzz, but this is an intranet project were only FF or Chrome are used :P
[02:08:09] <ravenzz> and as I am quite busy I wouldn't read its doc
[02:08:30] <Tomashe> yes has nothing to do with docs
[02:08:32] <ravenzz> have you tried another plugin? like fancybox?
[02:08:37] <Tomashe> the tirgger is good
[02:08:44] <ravenzz> mh
[02:08:45] <Tomashe> hmmm
[02:09:36] <ravenzz> so
[02:09:48] <ravenzz> inspecting those images on IE
[02:10:03] <ravenzz> I see that they are not wrapped into an a
[02:10:16] <ravenzz> so there should be something wrong in your js
[02:10:26] <ravenzz> have fun
[02:11:02] <Tomashe> look
[02:11:09] <Tomashe> i added link manualy inside the code
[02:11:19] <Tomashe> refresh the page... u can see it is working on IE
[02:11:28] <ajaxbud> thanks ravenzz
[02:11:29] <Tomashe> so i guess its something with the wrap()
[02:11:56] <ravenzz> you could try
[02:11:58] <ravenzz> wrapAll
[02:12:24] <codeho> Tomashe: works for me in 7 and 8 compat mode
[02:12:28] <codeho> its not pretty
[02:12:32] <codeho> but it works
[02:12:37] <Tomashe> hehe
[02:12:40] <ravenzz> ah no you need to build the links
[02:12:45] <Tomashe> why wrap all wil lchange something ?
[02:12:53] <Tomashe> what u mean build the links?
[02:13:09] <Tomashe> $(this).wrap('<a href="'+img+'">'); < this do it no?
[02:13:10] <ravenzz> get the src and set it as href
[02:13:22] <Tomashe> var img=$(this).attr("src");
[02:13:55] <Tomashe> i was paste my code before ravenzz
[02:13:56] <Tomashe> $(".CBCOLORBOX img").each(function(){		var img=$(this).attr("src");		$(this).wrap('<a href="'+img+'">');		});	$(".CBCOLORBOX a").colorbox();
[02:14:50] <pollycrack> i need some help with the cycle plugin using it as a slider.
[02:17:23] <Tomashe> fixed , my wrap was missing tag
[02:17:40] <Tomashe> i did : $(this).wrap('<a href="'+img+'">'); instead of $(this).wrap('<a href="'+img+'"></a>');
[02:17:41] <ravenzz> the closing one?
[02:17:59] <ravenzz> yea
[02:18:02] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/EMTJs/ there you go
[02:20:38] <ravenzz> anyway I would replace that FLASH bg crap
[02:20:57] <ravenzz> there is something that make the whole website slow, and it is because of that bg I guess
[02:21:11] <IvanKuzev> is there a way to see width 'auto' pixel value before applying it
[02:23:20] <sanderhartveld> can someone please show me the correct way to set this timeout? http://jsfiddle.net/E9t2b/
[02:24:24] <Cork> sanderhartveld: if you want them to go after each other you need to use the callbacks
[02:25:29] <codeho> sanderhartveld: $(click) ?
[02:25:35] <sanderhartveld> update: click should be this: http://jsfiddle.net/E9t2b/1/
[02:26:17] <MrBenn> uh
[02:26:23] <MrBenn> This won't be this
[02:26:29] <MrBenn> or not the this you are thinking of
[02:26:41] <MrBenn> as a timeout has it's own scope
[02:26:50] <codeho> yup
[02:26:59] <sanderhartveld> I was yoping you could point me in the right derection
[02:27:08] <sanderhartveld> ...hoping
[02:27:21] <codeho> grab it from event
[02:27:54] <sanderhartveld> how?
[02:28:03] <skrubis> anyone could help me to set the third slider to update the div("#vaaks") border radius? http://jsfiddle.net/Wcvgm/
[02:28:14] <codeho> or assign $(this) to a variable before and then use that
[02:28:41] <MrBenn> sanderhartveld
[02:28:42] <MrBenn> http://jsfiddle.net/E9t2b/2/
[02:29:09] <sanderhartveld> that is obvious :)
[02:29:21] <sanderhartveld> thank you!
[02:29:28] <baresedoc> ciao
[02:29:39] <baresedoc> !list
[02:29:51] <skrubis> anyone could help me to set the third slider to update the div("#vaaks") border radius? http://jsfiddle.net/Wcvgm/
[02:32:15] <codeho> skrubis: don't you want to use the value of the apaljims slider instead of the value of $("#slider").slider("value") ?
[02:33:48] <skrubis> codeho - thanks, a stupid mistake on my part
[02:35:15] <codeho> no prob
[02:35:41] <skrubis> by the way, how could I divide the value result by ten, so 300 is 30,0 for cm
[02:42:31] <Cork> skrubis: / 10 ?
[02:42:46] <Cork> or rather / 10.0
[02:42:55] <Cork> ?eval 300 / 10.0
[02:43:00] <bot-t> Cork: 30
[02:43:20] <skrubis> tnx figured it out
[02:43:35] <Cork> was that really all? O_o
[02:43:50] * Cork didn't mean that seriusly...
[02:44:37] <skrubis> by the way, what is the best resource/book/site for learning js and jquery? I really liked codeacademy aproach to teaching from absolute basics
[02:45:05] <Cork> opera has a quite good one
[02:45:19] <Cork> http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/1-introduction-to-the-web-standards-cur/
[02:45:43] <Cork> its not aimed at jquery though
[02:47:04] <skrubis> I want to learn js the old fashioned way to a certain level before digging in to jquery more than I need
[02:47:17] <skrubis> thanks, seems pretty solid pile of resources
[02:47:23] <Cork> thats a good aim
[02:47:24] <codeho> sounds like a good plan
[02:48:27] <skrubis> Did you know about codeacademy.com ? You can point all the newbies to there, pretty cool way to learn js basics
[02:48:32] <Spadeski> Hey can you guys help me make a simple chat I have all the functions and styled just the jquery to switch lists and what not i need help with
[02:49:45] <Spadeski> Anyoen lol
[02:50:12] * sanderhartveld is very happy. You are flowers in the garden of humanity.
[02:50:27] <codeho> probably not. but if you have a specific problem you can articulate i'm sure someone will be able to point you into the right direction.
[02:50:34] <codeho> (spaeski)
[02:50:38] <codeho> +d
[02:50:40] <Spadeski> mm alright
[02:51:15] <Spadeski> lets say I have a list and want too get which user to send the chat to when i click the list and it updates the chat saying you are talking with....
[02:51:45] <codeho> yes?
[02:52:10] <sanderhartveld> yes!
[02:52:39] <Spadeski> Yeah how do I do that simply
[02:52:42] <Spadeski> lol
[02:53:14] <codeho> implement a click listener on the usernames and based on which user clicked, display a chat window
[02:54:21] <codeho> also you probably want to load some previous conversation via ajax
[02:56:09] <lampy> hello all
[02:57:27] <lampy> anyone here that can help with a jquery question?
[02:58:36] <coldhead> everyone here can, lampy, if you can just ask it
[03:00:11] <rythmic> Hi! I am not sure this is a jquery question or a django one. However, here it goes. I am executing a form from a colorbox and then when I return from the form the main user interface is gone. What are the default strategies in a case like this?
[03:00:20] <lampy> Ok, great. I have a page that needs to update a column of divs from a page/db call. Right now I/ just getting back an array but I need help with updating the divs from that. Here is what I have so far - http://pastebin.com/mBXneJHD
[03:01:29] <rythmic> one thing that I think would be nice is if I could close the colorbox as I submit the form
[03:02:03] <lampy> The divs are identified by the same id in the retuned data
[03:04:30] <codeho> lampy:  your call returns html?
[03:05:13] <lampy> well yes it does since that is tho only thing I could get to work, don't know enough to work with data
[03:06:00] <codeho> why not make it return a json object with the id of the column as the key and value as the new content and then just loop through it and update the content?
[03:07:13] <codeho> unless you want to replace all columns in #EQ then i suppose this should work
[03:07:31] <Taloncor> thirdender: I was able to identify my problem with the submit-EventHandler. The Troublemaker is unobtrusive javascript for rails ;)
[03:09:58] <lampy> codeho, that is what I want to do but having trouble getting there. little beyond my reach of understanding. I have been successful with small HTML snippets but data, not so much
[03:10:35] <codeho> lampy: well first of all you need to make sure your backend returns a json string.
[03:10:42] <codeho> are you good up to that point?
[03:11:04] <lampy> yes, this is what I'm getting: [{"EQ":"22"},{"KC":"15"},{"BH":"9"},{"CALC":"3"},{"Fluids":"18"},{"PB":"24"},{"PSU":"4"},{"Regs":"3"},{"SIP":"31"},{"SSA":"2"},{"SSB":"19"},{"SS":"47"},{"TST":"9"},{"TR":"9"},{"VM":"1"},{"WWM":"1"},{"DM":"7"},{"WCT":"30"}]
[03:11:24] <lampy> basically categories with question counts per category
[03:11:48] <codeho> okay and you want to update those counts?
[03:12:25] <lampy> correct, when they change the "skill" level the counts need to update
[03:13:34] <codeho> lampy: something like this http://pastebin.com/PGf0thjR
[03:13:48] <codeho> gotta run for a meeting.
[03:14:46] <lampy> codeho, thanks for your help, i will give it a shot.
[03:16:11] <dwarder> which js minifyer do you use?
[03:20:28] <codercube> dwarder : yui
[03:23:02] <dwarder> i used jsmin
[03:23:13] <rich492> hi, I'm using jquery tabs to load content via ajax, all my tabs also reuse some jquery, my problem is how do I stop reloading scripts 10 times. I looked at livequery but can't figure out how I'd implement it. any help please?
[03:24:17] <codercube> rich492 : maybe you can check if jQuery object exists and if not, load script
[03:25:19] <codercube> dwarder : haven't tried it, i'm fine with yui compressor
[03:25:46] <dwarder> codercube: is it easy to use?
[03:26:07] <codercube> dwarder : pretty easy, it has good docs, see here http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/
[03:26:26] <dwarder> codercube: thanks
[03:27:54] <dwarder> codercube: have you tried to minify a minified version of jquery with other js files?
[03:28:06] <dwarder> codercube: how it behaves in such situation?
[03:28:31] <dwarder> codercube: jsmin doesn't seem to work, thats why i'm looking for another solution
[03:29:01] <codercube> dwarder : i 've written some batch file, which concats all project files and then passes the big file to yui, had no problems
[03:30:25] <dwarder> codercube: one concern that i have is minified files that is about to be minified, so you are saying that you had previously minified files run through this yui with no problem, right?
[03:30:30] <dwarder> codercube: just to clarify
[03:30:52] <codercube> dwarder : true
[03:30:56] <dwarder> codercube: thank you
[03:31:20] <rich492> codercube: do you have any example of this?? I can only find .live content delegation, but that uses the onclick handler.
[03:32:10] <qwerty57> http://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/
[03:32:26] <qwerty57> at the bottom there's a partners "sliding images"
[03:32:33] <qwerty57> what is correctly called?
[03:32:42] <qwerty57> tried googleing jquery sliders/rotators
[03:33:03] <qwerty57> nothing which doesn't require lots of rewriting
[03:33:08] <Pavelloz> "<script src="/Js/pro-slide.js" type="text/javascript"></script>"
[03:33:22] <qwerty57> it's not that one i've checked
[03:33:40] <qwerty57> search slideleft() in source
[03:33:44] <qwerty57> it's that
[03:33:56] <Pavelloz> its inline JS at bottom
[03:34:09] <Pavelloz> starts with "var sliderwidth"
[03:34:16] <PERECil_> hello
[03:34:18] <Pavelloz> imo :)
[03:34:20] <PERECil_> quick question
[03:34:41] <PERECil_> does the method append() returns the newly added element or the parent element ?
[03:36:37] <codercube> rich492 : maybe I didn't get your problem correctly, can you describe it a bit more?
[03:37:19] <hpatel> autocomplete function return computer &amp; tool  while in database  computer & tool
[03:37:31] <hpatel> can you know ?
[03:38:56] <rich492> codercube: I've got ajax jquery tabs running, I place all js in the index, then call tab content with ajax. when the content loads it adds elements to the dom, and some js needs to be run.
[03:39:42] <codercube> rich492 : ok, whats the problem
[03:41:05] <rich492> codercube: some of the js is already, so the first tab loads itself. if i go to another tab the js doesn't load.
[03:41:15] <rich492> already run
[03:41:33] <codercube> rich492 : can you show the code?
[03:45:28] <Spadeski> Damn did whole chat by myself im proud ;p
[03:47:43] <LEGRAND> ciao
[03:50:26] <rich492> codecube: http://pastebin.com/ZCQSTQ3L
[03:55:02] <prodn> how can I make it so that when I chose an <option> from <select>, the value I get will instead be the inner html of the option. That is; I want to replace the real value with that's inside <option></option>.

[04:05:10] * IvanKuzev wants to answer one query question
[04:05:31] <hariom> I am trying to create a modal dialog using qTip2 plugin. How to increase set the width of the modal window?
[04:06:48] <hariom> I am trying to create a modal dialog using qTip2 plugin. How to increase the width of the modal window?
[04:07:04] <codercube> rich492 : where is the ajax call?
[04:08:21] <Spadeski> codercube:  I know its not appropriate but tihs is for chat would you mind checking this simple SQL query ?
[04:08:25] <rich492> codercube,line 76, 1st link
[04:09:25] <codercube> rich492 : line 76 is  <li class="box2"><img src="images/macaw.jpg" alt="Macaw"/></li>
[04:09:43] <codercube> Spadeski : i can try
[04:09:50] <rich492> codercube, try here http://pastebin.com/ZCQSTQ3L
[04:10:31] <Spadeski> codercube well I want it too select the messages being send from and too the with SELECT * FROM gotactics_user_chat WHERE (chat_from_user_id='".$CUID."' AND chat_user_to_id='".$GUID."') OR (chat_from_user_id='".$GUID."' AND chat_user_to_id='".$CUID."')	
[04:10:34] <JAAulde> hariom: I don't see anything for it in the docs, and his CSS sets a max width
[04:11:19] <JAAulde> hariom: so you probably need to do something in your CSS or JS to adjust the width and max width on #ui-tooltip-modal
[04:11:26] <Spadeski> Only gets messages sent To me
[04:11:59] <hariom> JAAulde: In Content text, I have defined my html. If I change the width in that text, I doesn't take that width
[04:12:12] <risky_s> hi
[04:12:13] <hariom> JAAulde: In Content text, I have defined my html. If I change the width in that html css, I doesn't take that width
[04:12:28] <JAAulde> hariom: I have explained why, and what I think you need to adjust...
[04:12:35] <risky_s> i am trying to set a error message with a label
[04:12:40] <risky_s> how is this done?
[04:12:52] <risky_s> $("label[for='tkt_name']").val('Must enter name'); ??????
[04:12:54] <Spadeski> codercube:  error on my part nvm
[04:13:11] <hariom> JAAulde: which CSS? I have already tried in context part text area where the modal widow's html goes.
[04:13:17] <JAAulde> risky_s: .val() is for inputs.  .text() and .html() is for the content of a node
[04:13:49] <JAAulde> hariom: the CSS provided by the plugin sets a max width for the element #ui-tooltip-modal
[04:13:54] <risky_s> so if I do a valildation check, should I use .text('Error')?
[04:13:57] <JAAulde> hariom: I assume you need to override this
[04:14:28] <codercube> rich492 : maybe you want to try http://api.jquery.com/ajaxSuccess/
[04:14:37] <JAAulde> risky_s: if you like. You could also append a psan to your label such that the original label text stays in place, and gets augmented with error text
[04:14:59] <codercube> rich492 : you can attach any function to it
[04:15:02] <risky_s> thx working now
[04:15:31] <JAAulde> risky_s:  $("label[for='tkt_name']").append( '<span class="ui-state=error">Must enter name</span>' );
[04:16:07] <JAAulde> risky_s: upon correction and revalidation, $("label[for='tkt_name']").find( '.ui-state=error' ).remove();
[04:16:32] <JAAulde> risky_s: of course you'll have to do some checking before you append to ensure you haven't already appended the error (avoid duping in case they keep failing validation)
[04:17:03] <JAAulde> risky_s: in all code I just gave you I typoed the class name... s/ui-state=error/ui-state-error/
[04:17:29] <codercube> rich492 : or just use for ajaxOptions: {success: function(){ //do something } }
[04:17:30] <hariom> JAAulde: You are right. Got it
[04:17:36] <risky_s> i doing this instead
[04:17:37] <risky_s> <label class="error" for="tkt_price" generated="true">
[04:18:16] <JAAulde> hariom: sweet
[04:18:45] <JAAulde> risky_s: cool, cool
[04:27:48] <risky_s> is there a validation plugin that doesnt use the submit ?
[04:27:52] <risky_s> but a button input
[04:28:42] <ablomen> risky_s, they all should use the form submit event, has nothing to do with what type of element you use to submit the form
[04:29:27] <risky_s> what if I have to validation fields that should not be submitted straight away but need to be previewed?
[04:29:41] <risky_s> and another button to submit
[04:30:38] <ablomen> risky_s, make that another form and load it in a [different page, modal, div, etc]
[04:32:55] <lugzer> hi
[04:35:06] <lugzer> there's a project, i'm writing html and there is a guy who hooks it up in jQuery. i write kinda semantic structure, and the guy adds ids everywhere he can just because he needs to navigate to specific item later. i'm trying to explain him that the html structure allows you to navigate easily. he still wants to cram his id's everywhere. who's right?
[04:36:07] <Rembane> Depends. id are handy but do get out of hand quite quickly
[04:37:14] <lugzer> Rembane, well he thinks id's are easier to maintain. if something changes in html structure, jQuery needs to be adjusted.
[04:38:55] <Rembane> lugzer: Indeed.
[04:39:53] <lugzer> i kinda agree but then i could write no semantic code, and just cram everything with divs - is that the way just because that guy is lazy?
[04:41:37] <codeho> selecting by ids is also faster than bubbling through html structure
[04:41:49] <ablomen> lugzer, you can give other elements id's too... why not combine the two?
[04:43:17] <ablomen> who cares if #people .name is ul#people > li.person > span.name or div#id > .name, it should not matter if he does not over specify his selectors and you set the id's/classes right
[04:44:19] <lugzer> codeho, i know, but if you narrow it down it's also quite fast. i'd rather give id to a section and navigate down $('section.people > header > p') rather than give class to each <p> in that section.
[04:45:30] <codeho> lugzer: i agree
[04:45:53] <codeho> given that the order or the structure never changes.
[04:48:14] <zamba> hi there, i'm looking for a jquery plugin that let's the user pick a date and time more easily than just typing it in himself
[04:48:24] <zamba> i've used the datepicker plugin earlier
[04:48:58] <zamba> but that's just for dates, not for time
[04:49:19] <zamba> so i need something that combines the two
[04:52:50] <codeho> http://haineault.com/media/jquery/ui-timepickr/page/
[04:53:20] <lugzer> codeho, yeah and i wasn't implying something like $('body #wrap #main #left #content #content_wrap article .body p span')... ;)
[04:53:21] <codeho> or http://addyosmani.com/blog/the-missing-date-time-selector-for-jquery-ui/
[04:53:28] <codeho> (zamba)
[04:53:49] <codeho> zamba: or http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[04:53:53] <codeho> google is your friend :)
[04:54:41] <zamba> codeho: ah, sweet, thanks :)
[04:58:22] <ablomen> lugzer, its a lot slower, it will have to check each p to see if it has a header as parent that has a section as parent, instead of just seeing if it has a classname, see this >> http://jsperf.com/selectorssss
[04:58:42] <ablomen> and that's with just a few elements, in a big page the speed difference get's a lot worse
[04:59:08] <ablomen> and this is the same for css too btw while rendering the page, not only the sizzle selector engine
[04:59:32] <lugzer> ablomen, checking it out, loads some applet
[04:59:48] <rythmic> Hi! I have a colorbox question: if I have a colorbox which contains a form, can I somehow select the form from the parent window and add an onsubmit event to it?
[05:00:32] <ablomen> oh i guess thats for keeping track of the test results or something like that, don't have java installed here
[05:00:49] <lugzer> ablomen, it works now. thanks for the tip.
[05:03:14] <lugzer> ablomen, interesting with the [0] thing
[05:03:23] <lugzer> what is that and where can i read on that?
[05:05:10] <Blaster> is there a way to see if an element was clicked, not if it's a child?
[05:05:27] <Blaster> right now I have a click handler but if I click on a child of the element it closes as well
[05:07:08] <ablomen> lugzer, it just gets the dom element from the jquery object, nothing more
[05:07:34] <lugzer> ablomen, okay and how is this thing called so i can read up on this
[05:07:50] <ablomen> what thing?
[05:08:24] <lugzer> the [0]
[05:08:42] <lugzer> this access method has some name. i'd like to find it in jquery docs
[05:09:02] <ablomen> oh its the same as .get
[05:09:27] <ablomen> http://api.jquery.com/get/
[05:09:53] <lugzer> ablomen, great thanks
[05:09:54] <ablomen> (not to be confused with $.get, the ajax get request shorthand)
[05:24:18] <ThiefMaster> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/fieldselection
[05:24:22] <ThiefMaster> is this a bad joke?
[05:24:33] <ThiefMaster> breaking tons of links...
[05:37:52] <lampy> codeho: thanks for your help! got it working with a small tweak.
[05:41:18] <codeho> cool :)
[05:44:57] <dr0id> I think they ran out of money
[05:48:00] <codeho> hmm interesting
[05:56:16] <Jahan> I'm trying to get my script to run at a set size on a web page. Is it a <div> issue or can I set it within the script?
[05:56:23] <Jahan> http://pastebin.com/s2tyHjDc
[05:56:50] <Jahan> It writes the contents of a file to the screen as long as a key is pressed
[05:58:38] <Jahan> When I run it on a site, it only takes up a third of the screen and I'm not sure if it's a div issue or from my code
[06:02:06] <codeho> Jahan: example link?
[06:02:15] <cornfeed> i am trying to count elements with a certain attr, can i use wildcards?  something like  $("input[id='idname*]").length;
[06:02:50] <Zogot> can do it through an each loop adding +1 to a variable
[06:02:51] <Zogot> if found
[06:03:01] <cornfeed> ok
[06:03:43] <codeho> why not give all the ones you want to participate the same class?
[06:03:47] <cornfeed> i will ask in this way, I have a form with dynamically added fields that need to be counted....
[06:03:54] <cornfeed> bingo
[06:05:34] <cornfeed> can i mix jquery and javascript?
[06:05:55] <IvanKuzev> cornfeed : you can
[06:05:55] <cornfeed> var p = $("").length;
[06:06:03] <IvanKuzev> taht works
[06:06:09] <cornfeed> wow awesome
[06:06:15] <cornfeed> thx
[06:06:36] <cornfeed> and math? .length +1;
[06:06:48] <gearaholic> jquery is javascript.  so yes,  you can mix them
[06:07:08] <cornfeed> or should math be done on the variable after setting?
[06:07:34] <gearaholic> you could do p = $("").length+1;
[06:07:44] <cornfeed> nice thanks
[06:08:45] <gearaholic> only hangup you may get is just make sure your jquery code is within $(document).ready(function() {})
[06:09:24] <gearaholic> if you have p = $("").length+1; outside of that,  then jquery may not find the element your selecting
[06:09:28] <cornfeed> yeah thats why i was checking, this is a roundcube plugin
[06:10:35] <cornfeed> turns out i dont need math because jquery returns counts starting at 1 and not 0 so.... fixed!
[06:10:37] <cornfeed> thanks
[06:11:34] <gearaholic> tru
[06:12:36] <codeho> query is not a programming language, its a library, its written in javascript.
[06:12:40] <codeho> *jquery
[06:17:26] <amokkk_> Hi there... I have a calendar with dates... Using JS - I manipulate with content of it... To select correct date from calendar I use this: selector = $(".ui-state-default:contains('"+day+"')")
[06:18:01] <amokkk_> for number 9 it returns 9, 19, 29.. .I want to select by EXACT text..
[06:18:08] <amokkk_> Can any1 help me?
[06:19:39] <gearaholic> try 09
[06:20:08] <Taar779> amokkk_: contains() might be your issue. It would look for "9" in anything so it would match 19 or 29
[06:20:30] <gearaholic> ah yeah contains,  will find any match with 9 in it
[06:22:25] <Taar779> amokkk_: Try regex(). For example $("div:regex(class, .*sd.*)") class being the attr its looking at
[06:23:30] <Taar779> amokkk_: Here is a great post on the subject http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/
[06:25:45] <krogant> hi, i have a list of checkboxes, and want to retrieve the values for each one that's check and concatanate as a string - sounds complicated, how do i go about this?
[06:26:15] <codeho> krogant: http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[06:28:28] <krogant> thanks
[06:30:38] <jds> Anyone do much js testing?  Any advice on testing stuff that you know will give different results in different browsers?
[06:30:44] <amirite> is there a way to get all callbacks bound to an event on a jquery object?
[06:30:54] <amirite> I want to temporarily stash them then rebind them later
[06:32:42] <codeho> jds: why would it give a different result in a different browser?
[06:32:49] <codeho> if its not display elements
[06:33:08] <codercube> jds we use jQuery to forget such thinks like browser JS differences
[06:33:25] <jds> Yeah, sadly jquery doesn't supply a html5 audio shim yet...
[06:33:52] <jds> amirite: You might look at $('#foo').data('events')
[06:34:05] <jds> not sure if it's considered private API or not
[06:34:16] <amokkk_> Taar779, thx man )) it works
[06:34:32] <codeho> jds: http://www.browserscope.org/user/tests/table/agt1YS1wcm9maWxlcnINCxIEVGVzdBib2KQGDA
[06:34:57] <risky_s> hi, how do you remove a whole table from a html page when a button is clicked?
[06:35:00] <codeho> i suppose you could use modernizr to detect whats gonna be happy and what not
[06:35:08] <risky_s> $('#table').remove()?
[06:35:29] <codeho> risky_s: did you try it?
[06:35:30] <amokkk_> risky_s, $("#table").html('')
[06:35:35] <Taar779> amokkk_: No problem, glad it worked
[06:35:43] <codeho> amokkk_: that will just empty the table
[06:35:45] <amokkk_> risky_s, u could remove html of parent obj
[06:36:09] <amokkk_> codeho, *of parent obj
[06:36:43] <codeho> .html('') removes the innerHtml i believe
[06:36:45] <risky_s> i am trying to remove the whole table
[06:36:54] <codeho> risky_s: remove() should work
[06:37:38] <codeho> $('button').click(function(){ $('#table').remove(); });
[06:39:23] <risky_s> just tried it
[06:39:25] <risky_s> its not removing
[06:40:13] <risky_s> can i put .remove(table)
[06:40:23] <risky_s> i mean .remove('table')?
[06:40:31] <risky_s> and use the div its in as the selector
[06:41:44] <codeho> $('button').click(function(){
[06:41:44] <codeho>     $('table').html('');
[06:41:44] <codeho> });
[06:43:12] <codeho> ah yeah that'll just empty the inner
[06:43:14] <risky_s> thx working now, it was duplicating before
[06:43:24] <krogant> thanks codeho all sorted now :)
[06:43:50] <codeho> $('table').remove('table');
[06:43:52] <codeho> there it is
[06:43:53] <codeho> :)
[06:44:20] <codeho> kinda silly it wouldn't just work on the element with remove()
[06:44:44] <risky_s> year
[06:44:46] <risky_s> yer*
[06:44:49] <Rix> is there a way to read a text file from a the local file system using ajax .get() or other way.. I've read this note:
[06:44:51] <Rix> Due to browser security restrictions, most "Ajax" requests are subject to the same origin policy; the request can not successfully retrieve data from a different domain, subdomain, or protocol.
[06:45:32] <Rix> what I am trying to do is making a quiz without using db.. I want to load questions from txt file in the local fs
[06:45:37] <codeho> Rix as long as the txt file is within your DOCROOT you should be able to do it.
[06:46:11] <codeho> and if you're within the same domain ajax will work
[06:46:33] <codeho> xhr2 will support cross domain calls but its not yet supported by every browser
[06:46:46] <Rix> the thing is I'm using phonegap and making mobile app, so it seems that no http servers are running on the phone and the only way is to load it externally which is inconvinient while not connected to the web
[06:47:59] <codeho> and then why don't you store this in the database?
[06:48:40] <codeho> the websql database
[06:49:05] <Rix> will that work on a smartphone?
[06:49:21] <codeho> Rix: http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.2.0/phonegap_storage_storage.md.html#Storage
[06:49:29] <Rix> o thanks a lot
[06:49:37] <codeho> sure
[06:49:41] <Rix> I am newbie didnt knew that
[06:51:09] <codeho> http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.2.0/index.html is your friend :)
[06:51:44] <codeho> it also explains how to deal with files here: http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.2.0/phonegap_file_file.md.html#File
[06:51:54] <Rix> codeho thank you!
[06:52:13] <codeho> you're welcome
[07:05:50] <Flavius1924> can you tell me that site where i can paste in some code ?
[07:06:15] <shesek_> Flavius1924, jsfiddle.net
[07:06:29] <James13433> Has anybody seen this before, get a "This program cannot display this webpage" in ie7 only when certian js in enabled?
[07:06:40] <Flavius1924> thanks!
[07:10:48] <codeho> James13433:  go search google for this. also make sure you don't have any console.log in your js and any lists may not contain commas at the end
[07:12:01] <codeho> James13433: also look into JsLint
[07:12:38] <mathi> hi
[07:12:58] <James13433> Ahh, on console.log might cause it, I did try to go to google, but dunno what to search to get relevant results
[07:13:15] <mathi> how can I get the TR elements inside $(this) (which is a TBODY element) but only the first level (first children, not deeper) ?
[07:13:27] <codeho_awayz0r> James13433: get jslint and make sure it validates your code
[07:13:38] <beasty> mm
[07:13:54] <codeho_awayz0r> $(this).find('tr')
[07:14:27] <mathi> codeho_awayz0r, won't it take *all* the tr elements inside the tbody ?
[07:14:36] <codeho_awayz0r> ah
[07:14:36] <codeho_awayz0r> well
[07:14:39] <codeho_awayz0r> sorry misread
[07:14:50] <codeho_awayz0r> $(this).find('tr:first-child')
[07:15:27] <johnline3> lol amazing, i joined, saw this post ^ and it reminds me how to solve my issue
[07:15:41] <codeho_awayz0r> glad i could be of service :D
[07:17:07] <James13433> codeho_awayz0r that bring up an error in about every line of code I paste, am I missing something mabey because im useing prototype also?
[07:17:12] <mathi> codeho_awayz0r, but this give me only the first child ? I need all TR elements inside TBODY except the one in nested tables etcetera. the first descendants
[07:18:19] <codeho_awayz0r> James13433:  jQuery(this).find('tr:first-child')
[07:18:37] <James13433> what ?
[07:18:41] <codeho_awayz0r> wait
[07:18:48] <codeho_awayz0r> too many things at the same time right now
[07:18:54] <James13433> lol
[07:19:05] <codeho_awayz0r> James13433: if you're using prototype along query you may burn in hell and i can't help you :)
[07:19:14] <codeho_awayz0r> *jquery
[07:19:32] <codeho_awayz0r> mathi: what?
[07:19:41] <chrisinajar> mathi: $("tbody > tr")
[07:19:52] <James13433> codeho_awayz0r out of necessity not choice.
[07:20:17] <codeho_awayz0r> thats sad. i gotta run.
[07:20:21] <codeho_awayz0r> bbl
[07:21:05] <chrisinajar> James13433: what are you trying to do? i missed your question..
[07:21:05] <mathi> chrisinajar, thank you, now tbody is in $(this) so how can I use " > tr" ?
[07:21:19] <chrisinajar> mathi: .find("> tr") might work
[07:22:30] <James13433> chirsinajar, I am getting a weird result in ie7 and ie6 something, where it just gives me like a error asif im not connected to the internet or something. Only on certain pages with certain js enabled
[07:22:34] <beasty> why can't i do this ?
[07:22:38] <beasty> $('.passwdrow',$(this).parents('form'))
[07:22:50] <beasty> returns a empty object
[07:23:12] <James13433> so he suggested validating with jslite, but every line I past gives an error so not sure im doing it right
[07:24:29] <bartmax_> ? extend
[07:24:29] <bot-t> jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[07:24:40] <bartmax_> beasty that was for you
[07:24:46] <beasty> oh?
[07:25:11] <beasty> mi no understandino
[07:25:23] <bartmax_> $.extend(col, $('.passwdrow'), $(this).parents('form') )
[07:25:41] <mathi> chrisinajar, Note: The $("> elem", context) selector will be deprecated in a future release. Its usage is thus discouraged in lieu of using alternative selectors.
[07:25:55] <bartmax_> eso te va a retornar una coleccion con los objetos que tengan .passwdrow y el form que sea parent de 'this', en una variable llamada col
[07:26:33] <beasty> bartmax_: gives error :p
[07:26:34] <bartmax_> beasty: igual no entiendo porque queres tener juntos un elemento con clase .passwdrow y el form en un mismo objeto.
[07:27:01] <bartmax_> quien es $(this) ?
[07:27:08] <codercube> speak english
[07:27:19] <codercube> in public chat*
[07:27:28] <bartmax_> beasty: i will need jsfiddle if you want me to take a look at it
[07:27:35] <bartmax_> codercube: ok
[07:27:42] <beasty> ok hang on
[07:28:56] <beasty> bartmax_: http://jsfiddle.net/QWY6P/
[07:29:27] <beasty> also tried it with .extend() but it gave me the same
[07:35:17] <fommil> hi all - I have a Slider from jqueryui with multiple values. I'd like each handle to be a different colour - how can I do that?
[07:38:35] <bartmax_> beasty: http://jsfiddle.net/QWY6P/4/
[07:39:23] <bartmax_> beasty: one big problem you had : <p class="row" class="passwdrow"> will never have the class passwdrow. You must specify as <p class="row passwdrow">
[07:39:41] <beasty> oh right
[07:40:05] <prodn> how can I make it so that when I chose an <option> from <select>, the value I get will instead be the inner html of the option. That is; I want to replace the real value with that's inside <option></option>.
[07:40:30] <bartmax_> 	prodn .text('this is the innerHTML')
[07:41:00] <beasty> thanks bartmax_
[07:41:05] <beasty> works now
[07:41:11] <beasty> 2x class="" is not good
[07:41:18] <bartmax_> nope
[07:41:23] <bartmax_> hard to find also
[07:41:29] <beasty> just overlooked it
[07:41:33] <beasty> but thanks
[07:42:37] <bartmax_> np
[07:44:11] <Ezek2k5> i know that this doesnt is a direct cake question but im integratig a pdf on my cake and im having a little php problem... how i can convert &eacute; to Ã© ? i mean i tried html_entites_decode, utf8_decode htmlspecialchars
[07:44:22] <Ezek2k5> and nothing convert it :/
[07:44:39] <codeho> Ezek2k5: wrong channel?
[07:45:05] <Ezek2k5> lol yes kinda
[07:45:17] <Ezek2k5> and twice :P
[07:45:18] <Ezek2k5> hehe
[07:45:26] <mheap> Hey guys. I'm having an issue when if I add a header to an ajax request I get a 404 back
[07:45:30] <mheap> Without the header it works fine
[07:45:38] <mheap> And sending the header via curl also works fine
[07:45:43] <mheap> Any ideas?
[07:46:00] <mheap> Using $.ajaxSetup()
[07:46:12] <mheap> Tried both the beforeSend and headers: {} methods
[07:46:19] <codeho> Ezek2k5: but besides that html_entity_decode() should be what you need
[07:46:40] <codeho> Ezek2k5: if this isn't working there's another problem you're not aware of
[07:47:13] <PERECil_> $( 'span' ).remove().closest( '.cell:empty' ).remove(); that won't work, a suggestion how to circumvent it? (removing the node detachs it from the dom, loosing the access to the closest() method)
[07:47:16] <Ezek2k5> yes could be something with pdfs
[07:48:23] <mheap> PERECil_, $( 'span' ).closest( '.cell:empty' ).remove().end().remove() should do it
[07:48:50] <PERECil_> mheap: well, no, because the :empty evaluation would be done before the removal
[07:48:59] <bartmax_> try $('span').closest('.cell:empty').remove().end().remove()
[07:49:03] <bartmax_> damn u mheap
[07:49:48] <PERECil_> but if i can compute if the cell has only one element, that should to the trick
[07:51:12] <bartmax> PERECil_: what you said just make no sense
[07:51:27] <mheap> He wants to find the closest one *after* the span is removed
[07:51:57] <PERECil_> closest empty one :)
[07:51:58] <bartmax> so he wants to remove the span and a empty cell if any
[07:52:02] <PERECil_> yeah
[07:52:25] <codeho> find empty, grab closest sibling, remove empty?
[07:53:24] <bartmax> $parent = $('span').parent(); $('span').remove(); $parent.closest('.cell:empty').remove(); ???
[07:54:53] <codeho> bartmax: in this case parent is already gone, no?
[07:55:06] <codeho> since you only store an 'address' and not the whole element i suppose
[07:56:13] <codeho> which raises an interesting question does var foo = $(some_element) store a pointer to the element in the dom or does it actually copy the element into memory
[07:56:31] * IvanKuzev wants to answer a jquery questiion on query
[07:56:32] <codeho> bartmax: also lose the $, this is not php :)
[07:56:43] <timing_> it's a 'pointer'
[07:56:51] <mheap> codeho, using $ is a handy way to denote jQuery objects
[07:56:54] <codeho> thats what i thought
[07:56:58] <PERECil_> $( 'span' ).closest( 'cell:has(:not(:eq(2)))' ).remove().end().remove(); YEAH :D
[07:57:22] <codeho> mheap: ah that makes sense iguess
[07:58:37] <bartmax> PERECil_: that makes sense only of span if right after cell, in that case. its no clever way of doing it
[07:59:00] <PERECil_> after or direct child?
[07:59:11] <bartmax> direct child
[07:59:35] <PERECil_> yeah it's the case (yeah I know I could use parent)
[07:59:43] <bartmax> PERECil_: exactly
[07:59:58] <bartmax> PERECil_: because, actually, it wont work if cell is not it's parent.
[08:00:08] <PERECil_> yep
[08:00:15] <bartmax> so ... :)
[08:00:21] <_thumper_> Can I change a checkbox to use an image when checked and another when unchecked?
[08:00:43] <beasty> le sweet
[08:00:47] <beasty> bartmax: kuddos to you!
[08:01:08] <PERECil_> $( 'span' ).parent( ':has(:not(:eq(1)))' ).remove().end().remove()
[08:01:20] <PERECil_> eq 1 and not eq 2
[08:01:21] <bartmax> $span = $('span'); $span.parent().length > 1 ? $span.parent().remove() : $span.remove();
[08:01:32] <codeho> _thumper_: elaborate on that please
[08:01:39] <bartmax> beasty: nm
[08:01:45] <beasty> (:
[08:02:01] <bartmax> _thumper_: checkbox does not have images, but you can change an img src attribute when changing the checkbox state yes.
[08:03:19] <bartmax> should be == 1 sorry
[08:03:21] <bartmax> PERECil_
[08:03:24] <edgardo> http://jsfiddle.net/solariks/ZxkDS/ <-- how would I make the popupbox remain if you try to do over it? the 2nd and 3rd link in the navbar has hover effects
[08:03:30] <_thumper_> I would like an image to e
[08:03:42] <_thumper_> I would like an image to appear instead of a checkbox
[08:04:00] <edgardo> I think I somehow need to extend the area of hover to the popupwrapper, but can't figure out how to do it
[08:04:05] <_thumper_> Then when clicked the checkbox image swaps
[08:04:17] <_thumper_> However I would like it to be a checkbox for asp.net purposes
[08:04:25] <_thumper_> Not just an image that changes on click
[08:04:32] <beasty> mm
[08:04:44] <bartmax> edgardo: you can do the mouseenter remove all and show the current one, and do no mouseleave envent
[08:04:50] <beasty> "j is undefined" what's this ?
[08:05:05] <PERECil_> bartmax: i'll use your version :)
[08:05:20] <PERECil_> something tells me that's faster ;)
[08:06:13] <bartmax> edgardo: if you want to leave the 'box' you must make it inside the li and use event.stopPropagation()
[08:06:17] <bartmax> PERECil_: :)
[08:06:36] <PERECil_> ah ermm
[08:06:44] <PERECil_> $e.siblings().length > 0 ? $e.remove() : $e.parent().remove();
[08:06:58] <hariom> I am using qTip2 modal plugin. How to call modal window to show from inside a function? I have a click event bound to a function. I want that when this function is called, it first verify that data and then call for modal window to open.
[08:07:00] <PERECil_> $span.parent() will always be equals to 1
[08:07:11] <PERECil_> it's the siblings that i'd like to check
[08:07:16] <bartmax> edgardo: also, don't use SAME ID in different elements
[08:07:27] <bartmax> PERECil_: ha right :)
[08:07:48] <bartmax> ? siblings
[08:07:49] <bot-t> .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[08:08:47] <hariom> I have a text box in which I fill a word. When save is called, I want to first validate that word and then open a modal window to add another word. How to make sure that modal windo doesn't open without varification
[08:09:04] <bartmax> dunno if it's there a way to know if a element it's a only sibling without looking to the parent. maybe there are
[08:09:24] <PERECil_> bah siblings does the trick
[08:09:27] <bartmax> hariom: make the modal open on the callback of validation
[08:09:34] <PERECil_> $e.siblings().length > 0 ? $e.remove() : $e.parent().remove(); like this
[08:09:54] <PERECil_> if siblings length > 0 that means that the span isn't the last of the cell
[08:09:59] <hariom> bartmax: How to call modal on an event?
[08:10:04] <bartmax> oh ok, then sibling works perfect
[08:10:20] <edgardo> bartmax, I fixed the ids now.. but didn't understand quite what you meant with that .mouseenter() thing.. I tried to look it up but can't understand how it differs from .hover()
[08:10:35] <PERECil_> edgardo: mouseenter fires one time
[08:10:48] <PERECil_> hover fires each time you move the mouse over
[08:10:52] <bartmax> exactly
[08:12:11] <edgardo> so I put the mouseleave on the div which contains the submenu?
[08:14:33] <M4d3L> hi. anyone use Datajs lib? or know if it have some support irc channel for that one?
[08:19:33] <nivardus> is there a known pattern for passing a nonstatic member function to a jquery event handler (so the callback takes place within the scope of an object) or is that just impossible with prototypical code
[08:20:50] <hariom> Is it necessary to define qTip on document ready?
[08:20:56] <IvanKuzev> look for $.proxy
[08:21:24] <m0dmd> can someone take a look at my code, located here http://campussocialitemedia.com/thecampussocialite/featured-gallery.html and help me optimize or make it better
[08:21:51] <edgardo> shait.. http://jsfiddle.net/solariks/sqkMU/ <-- now I got it working but there's a small flicker when you hover over a menu item, go into the box and back up
[08:22:37] <edgardo> also.. if you hover over a menu item and never go into the popupwrapper div it never goes away :X
[08:22:50] <martco> how do i bind an .autocomplete  to an element after it's pulled into the DOM from and ajax call
[08:22:58] <martco> ?
[08:22:58] <squeakytoy> hm, I see that jquery parsexml returns an xmldocument, but where the heck do i see what functions are avaiable in the xmldocument?

[08:33:52] <edgardo> I tried to make it like that also, as new <ul>s inside the <li>s, but I figured it would become too messy when there's going to be 20+ categories in every wrapper div :)
[08:35:04] <edgardo> oh the content is there but is white :)
[08:35:42] <edgardo> that's why I didn't see it hehe.. well still only one little problem left.. hiding the popup when you actually don't go inside it
[08:36:41] <PERECil_> bartmax? by any chance do you know if we use html( data ) in conjunction with a script tag, the JS is getting evaluated? I know that load() does it, but for html, i'm not sure

[09:31:35] <JonathanCutrell_> Hey folks.
[09:33:11] <blazedd> hello all, anyone here that can help with jquery mobile?
[09:43:46] <Jon47>  bladedd just ask, if someone can help, they will pipe up
[09:45:42] <blazedd> have :(
[09:53:54] <Engin> xss escaping ?
[09:54:07] <MoTiOnXml> i'm having trouble creating a draggable on the mousedown event; i have to click (i.e. mousedown) twice, before the draggable is actually draggable
[09:54:15] <MoTiOnXml> anyone been in the same situation?
[09:54:28] <MoTiOnXml> from e.g. http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3876 it seems i'm not the only one
[09:54:58] <MoTiOnXml> basically i've got a tree (potentially very large), that i'd like to drag-enable
[09:55:48] <MoTiOnXml> so i'm using $(tree).on("mousedown", .. on the container to delegate the dragging
[09:56:36] <MoTiOnXml> your suggestions on above?
[09:57:08] <MoTiOnXml> i've tried re-triggering the draggable, but it seems the draggable UI widget is not built for triggering "inside" of an event
[09:57:30] <bonhoffer> is there a way to make a jquery slider select between multiple values: [1,2,3]
[09:57:40] <bonhoffer> so the slider value is only 1 2 or 3
[09:59:47] <MoTiOnXml> it seems calling (this).draggable().data('draggable')._mouseDown(e); forces the draggable to operate correctly
[10:00:00] <MoTiOnXml> would be nice to be able to enable it from the outside
[10:00:09] <MoTiOnXml> and calling the "enable" function doesn't work
[10:01:00] <Engin> no solution for character escaping to fight with cross site scripting ?
[10:01:10] <blazedd> I'm working on a Jquery Mobile site. I'm trying to bind .search to toggleslide the searchbar. How can I make this work across all DOM's (between page loads). http://devnot.es
[10:01:54] <Engin> blazedd: cookies
[10:02:45] <blazedd> while that will help with keeping it the way it was
[10:02:50] <blazedd> sorry
[10:03:13] <blazedd> that will help with the state, but won't help the event tracking not working
[10:03:27] <Engin> can you re-ask
[10:04:07] <blazedd> ?
[10:04:14] <Engin> (cookies can be used for communication of different tabs within the same browser btw)
[10:04:25] <Engin> blazedd: your question is not clear. re-ask.
[10:05:54] <blazedd> I'm working on a Jquery Mobile site. I'm trying to bind tap/click .search to toggleslide the search form. How can I make this work across all pages as they are loaded into the DOM via ajax (between page loads). Retaining the status can be tracked with a cookie and a variable, however the event of tap/click doesn't remained bound http://devnot.es
[10:06:10] <blazedd> perhaps I should change ID's to classes, but I don't think that is the main problem I'm having
[10:06:14] <Whirl3d> okay, in writing a plugin that you want chainable, you return this.each(function () .....but could you also return  this.map(function () ?
[10:07:53] <Engin> blazedd: what do you mean loading page wih ajax ?
[10:08:09] <blazedd> jquery mobile works with ajax, loading each page and inserting it into the dom
[10:08:37] <Engin> personally, I'd put all the pages in a single html and fetch data
[10:08:39] <Engin> not the UI
[10:09:04] <Engin> anyway, even if you update the DOM, what's the problem ?
[10:09:55] <blazedd> the event won't retain being bound to the new dom elements, even with live()
[10:10:48] <Engin> well, I think you suck at stating your problem...
[10:11:06] <Engin> but... you want $('.search').click(toggleslide); and you want that to apply newly added elements too ?
[10:11:11] <blazedd> I am inclined to agree :/
[10:13:16] <Engin> why can't find a defacto routine for solid character escaping ?!
[10:14:24] <blazedd> Engin: what are you looking to escape?
[10:14:32] <blazedd> special chars?
[10:15:04] <McBoingBo> I have a jquery form, that on submit I am trying to inject javascript (our Google Analytics code), but I am finding out I cannot inject javascript into the jqeury form, can someone help me start researching in the right direction?
[10:15:10] <Engin> < ' " > bla bla
[10:15:24] <blazedd> http://phpjs.org/functions/htmlspecialchars:426 and http://phpjs.org/functions/htmlspecialchars_decode:427 might help?
[10:16:27] <blazedd> nice set of functions that php has that has been made into js
[10:16:36] <Engin> yep something exactly like that, but this is a common problem, why isn't there a single defacto solution, I'm confused
[10:16:56] <codercube> McBoingBo : what do you mean "inject"?
[10:17:52] <McBoingBo> codercube, trying to echo from the PHP file that is the action of the Jquery form, and the echo is literally the Google Analytics code, and it is not running the "<script>" portion
[10:19:21] <codercube> McBoingBo : need to see the code
[10:19:25] <McBoingBo> codercube, http://pastebin.com/R90Rywh9
[10:20:18] <McBoingBo> codercube, that snippet is from the "action" PHP file, I am trying to echo the Google code into a Jquery window (its a lightbox div) sorry I am a noob still learning
[10:20:50] <_thumper_> Does this make sense? $.fancybox.close().delay(3000);
[10:20:56] <_thumper_> The delay part is not working
[10:21:11] <McBoingBo> codercube, Problem starts at line 10-19 really, the script tag will not run within the jquery
[10:23:08] <codercube> McBoingBo : maybe you should try ajax?
[10:23:36] <McBoingBo> codercube, I am not sure how to go about that, any help is appreciated
[10:24:31] <codercube> McBoingBo : and why your JS is commented?
[10:24:50] <McBoingBo> codercube, thats the way Google states to paste it
[10:25:19] <fission6> how would i delete an attribtue from an element, every now and then an iframe doesn't seem to load the src url, i want to try to delete the src attribute and then set it vs just doing attr(src,url)
[10:25:28] <bonhoffer> i've set up a slider like this: http://www.filamentgroup.com/examples/slider_v2/index3.php
[10:25:34] <bonhoffer> but i can't fire a callback on change
[10:25:50] <McBoingBo> I need google analytics to run on the submit, I guess I need to find a new place to send that out, I dunno
[10:28:02] <codercube> McBoingBo : well, I suggest you use ajax http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ , on success return some code, then on client side analyze whether you need or not to do the google analytics scripts
[10:29:17] <codercube> McBoingBo actually, this google analytics code has nothing to do with jQuery
[10:29:28] <McBoingBo> codercube, so you dont think I can put the google analytics code somewhere earlier in the process?
[10:29:58] <McBoingBo> codercube, Well it does in the sense that the code only runs on submit, so there is THAT relation
[10:30:22] <codercube> McBoingBo : sorry, I haven't studied the conversion stuff that google analytics provide, can't help you with that directly
[10:30:51] <McBoingBo> codercube, thanks anyway dood
[10:31:30] <codercube> McBoingBo : anyway, take a try with ajax
[10:32:10] <McBoingBo> codercube, readin up on it now :) here goes nothing
[10:33:54] <slindberg> does anyone know if there a new releases mailing list?
[10:34:13] <Engin> cross browser color tinting ?
[10:34:19] <Engin> i.e. an input
[10:34:35] <Engin> (for givin visual feedback of an error related to an input=
[10:35:18] <slindberg> I just want to receive an email notification when a new jQuery version is released
[10:36:17] <ajpiano> slindberg , are twitter and rss not sufficient?
[10:37:46] <sgrover> Easy question, how do I search sibiling elements to find the one with an autocomplete set up on it?
[10:38:06] <sgrover> Do I need to do a sibilings().each() and check for the autocomplete on every sibling?
[10:38:27] <slindberg> ajpiano: the twitter feed is pretty noisy, I'm really just concerned with releases; I'll take your answer as a no, thanks
[10:39:27] <codercube> email newsletter would be good, tinyMCE for example have one, it's quite convenient
[10:42:57] <imsky> bla bla bla
[10:43:03] <imsky> talk you heathens
[10:43:10] <ajpiano> slindberg: we don't have an e-mail feed about it, unfortunately
[10:43:13] <sgrover> k.  Beat my problem.  Am just doing a search for .siblings('.ui-autocomplete-input').  No .each() loop needed.
[10:45:09] <ajpiano> slindberg: on the other hand, we've had 9 public tweets in the last month - half of which are about new releases
[10:45:25] <MoTiOnXml> isn't it best practice to use quotes ("") to state key names for objects? i.e. { "draggable": true } as opposed to without quotes?
[10:45:30] <MoTiOnXml> i mean, for consistency?
[10:45:51] <nylinuxhelp> Hi all, I'm trying to make a jsfiddle to demonstrate a jQuery mobile error - nt having luck
[10:46:35] <nylinuxhelp> basically,the error is "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'children' of undefined" when i try to apply a ).trigger('click') event to a defined id
[10:47:02] <codercube> MoTiOnXml : keys in objects don't have quotes
[10:47:50] <Typh> ok, I've asked this a million times in a million different ways, never really getting a helpful answer, but here goes again: say I get a typeerror, very likely from calling something on an empty selector. How do I track down where the selector that may have thrown it is? Using chrome dev tools, but I'll use anything that can climb me out of the jquery lines and back into my own broken code
[10:48:19] <imsky> Typh: provide some code
[10:48:32] <Engin> ok guys any creative ideas on error handling on this form http://beta.gettingback.at/#setSlide_post
[10:48:46] <Engin> how to give visual feedback of error
[10:48:56] <Typh> imsky: I can't provide code since the problem is not knowing what code is broken.
[10:50:03] <codercube> Typh : try console.log('zzz') in different places of function to see where the code breaks
[10:50:24] <imsky> 0_o
[10:50:35] <imsky> 'zzz' verbatim, codercube?
[10:51:08] <codercube> imsky : well, better to use console.log('jedipower');
[10:51:25] <Typh> codercube: I'm looking for something smarter than "guess and check". I mean, I can have the debugger break on the type error. I just don't know if there's ever anything useful in the properties/locals of the callstack to find out which actual line of my code caused it
[10:51:39] <imsky> if you debug by throwing random "echos" in your control flow, you need to lrn2code
[10:52:53] <codercube> imsky : yep, it's better to run unit tests, but code must be written in a special style.. console.log is just the easiest way to start from../
[10:53:13] <prodn> how do I put $.load() $.fadeIn() in a combo? I want whatever loaded to fade in
[10:53:32] <Typh> no. if I can break of uncaught exceptions, surely some process can narrow down what happens
[10:53:50] <Typh> happened*, without manually hunting for it through thousands of lines of js
[10:55:04] <edgardo> bartmax, been fighting with this several hours now without luck :D
[10:55:10] <edgardo> feel like a noob :D
[10:55:36] <prodn> nvm, I figured, it was: .load().hide().fadeIn('slow'); for example
[10:58:29] <nylinuxhelp> hi, found out what was causing it - followed the advice here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6874652/jquery-mobile-error-cannot-call-method-trigger-of-undefined
[10:59:15] <rotozip> I am using $('#mySelectID').empty() to remove my select box options.  When I view the html in Developer tools all options are gone but when I click the dropdown list they still show in the application.  Any ideas here?
[10:59:18] <nylinuxhelp> the big-miss was trying to get it to work with document).ready - which is not preferred for jQuery Mobile. pagecreate is the preferred
[10:59:33] <bartmax> edgardo: take a look at other site :) sendstar.com.uy for example.
[11:01:25] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  jQuery UI datepicker.  Trying to have it populate an entirely hidden field.  Currently having a button appended to it.  Any choice besides display:none on that element?
[11:02:49] <edgardo> bartmax, yeah I can do that kind of dropdown menu in css only.. but the problem comes when there is space between the top menu and the popupwrapper
[11:02:56] <edgardo> and I need there to be space in between
[11:03:21] <bartmax> define this: when i want the menu being hide
[11:03:26] <bartmax> all cases
[11:03:30] <Snerf> on http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#portlets .. if you move the 2 items from the 3rd column, and place them in the 2nd/1st, you are unable to place anything bck into the 3rd column..is there a fix for this?
[11:03:31] <bartmax> and just write them down
[11:05:16] <edgardo> bartmax, I have them in my head, will you help if I write them down? :)
[11:05:33] <bartmax> edgardo: i cant right now
[11:05:37] <bartmax> edgardo: but it will help you
[11:07:41] <Engin> shit, i can't find an intiutive, creative way of error reoprting
[11:08:00] <McBoingBo> I have a jquery form, I am trying to figure out how to output google analytics code on submit, can someone steer me in the right direction?
[11:08:24] <Engin> McBoingBo: what do you want to do in big picture
[11:08:25] <kggle> hey, any way to remove duplice data-color="red" attributes?
[11:09:14] <McBoingBo> Engin, I thought that was the big picture, on submit I want my google analytics sent off, but it seems everything I have done so far is not working
[11:09:45] <Engin> McBoingBo: why do you want to do that
[11:09:57] <McBoingBo> Engin, whats wrong with that?
[11:10:05] <McBoingBo> Engin, I want to track form submissions
[11:10:34] <Engin> well, form action target to an iframe
[11:10:37] <Engin> and load your ga there
[11:10:41] <Engin> if you want
[11:11:29] <McBoingBo> Engin, hmmm, right now it just actions to a php file, which I was echoing the literal google analytics code, which is a no no I found out, Javascript running in the jquery window
[11:11:51] <Engin> you can do that
[11:12:02] <Engin> form submission is a simple HTTP request
[11:12:13] <Engin> you return the whole html with ga code in it
[11:12:18] <McBoingBo> Engin, it wouldnt work, my script tag kept getting stripped, see this code http://pastebin.com/R90Rywh9
[11:13:39] <Engin> that is a useless paste
[11:14:11] <Engin> you submit your form to YOUR php right ? so you can clearly see the ouptut of the submit in your browser
[11:14:19] <Engin> if it is valid html... then gs code will work
[11:14:27] <Engin> if not, find out why you can't generate valid html code
[11:15:08] <McBoingBo> Engin, you lost me there
[11:16:30] <McBoingBo> Engin, the form does submit action to a PHP file but the form also has some Jquery that runs on submit, thus bringing you to a thank you message in a lightbox div, inside THERE is where the PHP action file runs and of course cannot output javascript, right?
[11:20:16] <McBoingBo> Engin, I guess maybe I lost you there lol
[11:23:32] <Engin> McBoingBo: who posts the form ? you do it programatically ?
[11:23:48] <Engin> i.e. $.ajax($('#form').serialize()); ?
[11:24:58] <McBoingBo> Engin, http://pastebin.com/XHGkV9kT
[11:26:01] <McBoingBo> Engin, that code snippet is at the bottom of the form, the previous pastebin is from the PHP file that is actioned from the form
[11:26:21] <ravenzz> what are you trying to do?
[11:26:47] <McBoingBo> what I am trying to do is somehow get my Google Analytics code to trigger on the form submit
[11:27:19] <ravenzz> have you read this http://goo.gl/VHKzs ?
[11:27:41] <McBoingBo> ravenzz, somewhat, yes, I am still learning
[11:28:29] <Engin> McBoingBo: ok, so you are posting by $.post
[11:29:39] <Engin> I think for your purposes, it would be best to just post to an iframe target.
[11:29:47] <ProLoser|Work> has anyone used knockoutjs?
[11:29:59] <Engin> no idea why you are not keeping the stats with php
[11:30:13] <Engin> what you are doing is complete nonsense :D
[11:30:14] <McBoingBo> Engin, because I do not know how
[11:30:35] <McBoingBo> Engin, I would agree if I knew this better, it got plopped on my lap, I am trying to make the best of it
[11:31:41] <Engin> McBoingBo: with php it is dead easy
[11:31:47] <Engin> you don't know php at all ?
[11:32:06] <McBoingBo> Engin, but I already mentioned, I cannot echo the google code from the php file because you are already inside a jquery window
[11:32:13] <Engin> ok I'M leaving the coffee shop
[11:32:27] <McBoingBo> later dood, thanks for trying
[11:32:27] <Engin> good luck
[11:32:51] <ravenzz> McBoingBo don't waste your time trying to do odd stuffs
[11:33:06] <ravenzz> read that damned guide
[11:33:11] <McBoingBo> I just want this to work

[11:47:32] <bonhoffer> taking a series of rows and turning them into embedded data
[11:48:43] <v0lZy> never mind
[11:48:44] <v0lZy> solved
[11:48:46] <v0lZy> too many quotes :D
[11:52:56] <v0lZy> another puzzle
[11:53:05] <v0lZy> var trgt = 'Page0'
[11:53:13] <v0lZy> var pages = "Page3 Page4 Page5 Page6 Page7 Page8 Page9 Page10";
[11:53:15] <v0lZy> 			var page = pages.search(trgt);
[11:53:31] <v0lZy> why does this return 50 ?
[11:54:40] <ngharo> ?eval "Page3 Page4 Page5 Page6 Page7 Page8 Page9 Page10".search('Page0')
[11:54:43] <bot-t> ngharo: -1
[11:54:56] <ngharo> v0lZy: what you talkin bout willis?
[11:55:29] <ngharo> also search is typically used with a regexp
[11:55:33] <ngharo> indexOf is probably faster
[11:55:50] <v0lZy> well
[11:55:52] <v0lZy> trgt changes
[11:56:13] <v0lZy> i need to check if trgt is in the string pages
[11:56:13] <bartmax> edgardo: do a container wrapper that have the full navmenu with the elements inside. and do the hide on mouseleave the container
[11:56:37] <v0lZy> if (pages.search(trgt) == -1) ... do something, else do something else
[11:56:40] <ngharo> v0lZy: -1 is no match, anything else is a match
[11:56:44] <v0lZy> yeah
[11:56:57] <v0lZy> but why does Page0 match to Page3 Page4 Page5 Page6 Page7 Page8 Page9 Page10 ??
[11:57:02] <ngharo> it doesn't
[11:57:14] <bartmax> edgardo: http://jsfiddle.net/Re9RE/1/
[11:57:25] <ngharo> you said trgt changes, it must be changing to something in your haystack
[11:58:33] <v0lZy> ngharo it does match
[11:58:39] <v0lZy> but it returns 50
[11:58:50] <v0lZy> i have
[11:58:56] <v0lZy> #Page0 to #Page12
[11:59:08] <v0lZy> trgt changes between 'Page0' and 'Page12'
[11:59:23] <v0lZy> ah
[11:59:27] <v0lZy> stupid me
[11:59:27] <v0lZy> it matches page1
[11:59:29] <v0lZy> page10 = page 1...
[11:59:49] <v0lZy> how do i get it to match 'trgt ' instead of 'trgt'
[11:59:51] <v0lZy> ?
[11:59:55] <v0lZy> (extra space)
[12:00:16] <ngharo> ?eval "Page3 Page4 Page5 Page6 Page7 Page8 Page9 Page10".indexOf('Page1 ')
[12:00:17] <bot-t> ngharo: -1
[12:00:51] <ngharo> ?eval var trgt = 'Page1'; "Page3 Page4 Page5 Page6 Page7 Page8 Page9 Page10".indexOf(trgt + ' ')
[12:00:52] <v0lZy> in my case that would be trgt instead of 'Page1 '
[12:00:53] <bot-t> ngharo: -1
[12:01:09] <v0lZy> yeah, that!
[12:02:42] <v0lZy> works the way i want it now
[12:02:48] <v0lZy> thanks ngharo
[12:02:56] <ngharo> :)
[12:03:03] <ngharo> that wont match Page10 ever tho
[12:03:47] <v0lZy> need to add a space?
[12:03:59] <ngharo> yeah that'd work
[12:04:04] <ngharo> or i think
[12:04:07] <ngharo> ?eval var trgt = 'Page10'; "Page3 Page4 Page5 Page6 Page7 Page8 Page9 Page10".search(new Regexp(trgt + '[$|\s]'))
[12:04:08] <bot-t> ngharo: ReferenceError: Regexp is not defined
[12:04:15] <ngharo> ?eval var trgt = 'Page10'; "Page3 Page4 Page5 Page6 Page7 Page8 Page9 Page10".search(new RegExp(trgt + '[$|\s]'))
[12:04:16] <bot-t> ngharo: -1
[12:04:20] <v0lZy> w8
[12:04:31] <NackNick> how can i target a button within a iframe i want to add the click function to it
[12:04:33] <v0lZy> ?eval var trgt = 'Page1'; "Page3 Page4 Page5 Page6 Page7 Page8 Page9 Page10 ".indexOf(trgt + ' ')
[12:04:33] <ngharo> nope.  meh.  just append a space to your haystack
[12:04:33] <bot-t> v0lZy: -1
[12:04:48] <v0lZy> ?eval var trgt = 'Page10'; "Page3 Page4 Page5 Page6 Page7 Page8 Page9 Page10 ".indexOf(trgt + ' ')
[12:04:48] <bot-t> v0lZy: 42
[12:04:50] <v0lZy> yeah
[12:04:54] <v0lZy> thats what i was thinking :D
[12:05:03] <v0lZy> btw
[12:05:21] <v0lZy> any fix in jquery for fading in/out transparent png images where it becomes gray in explorer?
[12:06:00] <ngharo> pretty sure that's a common issue, google transparent png +IE
[12:08:09] <v0lZy> hm
[12:08:15] <v0lZy> i mean... its ok most of the time
[12:08:20] <v0lZy> except when i fade it in and out with jquery
[12:10:13] <NackNick> how can i target a button thats in a iframe i want to add the click function to it
[12:10:15] <igore> !help
[12:11:35] <v0lZy> wouldnt that like violate things
[12:12:04] <v0lZy> if its in an iframe and thats a separate file, it would have to have the javascript stuff executed in that file
[12:12:10] <v0lZy> ... righ?
[12:12:13] <v0lZy> ?
[12:12:18] <v0lZy> t damnit
[12:14:25] <igore> Hi guys, after a few days or troubleshooting I finaly pin pointed the problem..
[12:14:33] <stygyan> what was it, igore?
[12:14:55] <igore> I can't get .wrap() to work when I create an HTML element on the fly
[12:14:57] <igore> like so: $('<input>').wrap('<form>');
[12:15:18] <igore> On the other hand, if I already have an element and I use a selector:
[12:15:19] <igore> $('input').wrap('<form>');
[12:15:21] <igore> then it works..
[12:16:27] <igore> however, I need to create the HTML elements on the fly and bind click events to them..
[12:16:49] <igore> Here is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/VCRqc/2/
[12:17:05] <ngharo> I dont know why thats happening but you could simply $('<form><input /></form>')
[12:18:03] <igore> ngharo
[12:18:13] <igore> I will be doing lots of that in my code..
[12:18:18] <igore> and I wanted to create a plugin
[12:18:51] <igore> so I can just do $('<input>').inlineEditable();
[12:20:23] <igore>  $('<form><input></form>').inlineEditable(); seems unecessary
[12:20:31] <ngharo> igore: http://jsfiddle.net/VCRqc/3/
[12:21:34] <igore> ngharo: so it had to be appended before I could apply the .wrap() method?
[12:21:54] <ngharo> igore: the first comment states your problem.  Seems like it must be in the DOM before you can wrap it
[12:21:57] <ngharo> see ?wrap

[12:22:58] <VooDooNOFX_> when instantiating a new datepicker object, how can I set a default date of now?
[12:23:19] <ifdef42> i have a php/mysql app and i'm rewriting the front end to use jQuery.
[12:23:47] <ngharo> VooDooNOFX_: doesn't it already?
[12:24:24] <ifdef42> i found myself writing out a bunch of records like <a data-username="john" data-posts="52" data-birthday="blah" data- . . .>
[12:24:39] <ifdef42> it seemed really dumb. what's a better way to expose a bunch of mysql data to my app?
[12:25:09] <ngharo> VooDooNOFX_: the demo shows it does.  But anyways you can pass the default date with the *gasp* defaultDate option
[12:25:15] <ifdef42> like to read from JSON with Ajax i guess or something
[12:25:40] <VooDooNOFX_> ngharo: I should have stated that i'm also using a custom addon called timepicker, found here: http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[12:25:48] <VooDooNOFX_> and those demos don't have a default.
[12:27:15] <ngharo> VooDooNOFX_: has a similiar option on the page you linked.  pass hour and minute options
[12:27:28] <ngharo> ?eval new Date().getHours()
[12:27:29] <bot-t> ngharo: 1
[12:27:42] <ngharo> ?eval new Date().getMinutes()

[12:27:59] <_thumper_> Hi how do I predownload a single image?
[12:28:20] <ngharo> ?g javascript preload image
[12:28:22] <bot-t> ngharo, How to Preload an Image - http://www.mediacollege.com/internet/javascript/image/preload.html
[12:28:29] <_thumper_> thanks
[12:29:16] <lyrae> I have a bunch of <li>. one of them has an #id. how do i select all the <li>, except the one with the #id? im trying things like li:not["#new_tab"] but so far its a no go
[12:29:50] <ngharo> lyrae: close.  $('li:not("#id")')
[12:30:11] <methods> is there anything i can do to change my environment so that jquery works properly to control a 2nd window ?
[12:30:20] <ngharo> lyrae: oops those dbl quotes are not needed
[12:30:35] <ngharo> methods: second window as in window.open() ?
[12:30:45] <methods> yea
[12:31:20] <ngharo> i think you can do something like: var w = window.open( ... );  var jqNewWindow = $(w.document);
[12:31:53] <Smekman> ANyone got any information on creating overlays?
[12:31:56] <methods> I'm not doing any evil.. I'm trying to use jquery in selenium to invoke a keyup event on another window.. i was able to find the element using $(selector,window.document) but trying to trigger keyup doesn't work but doing it from the window in firebug works fine
[12:32:27] <ngharo> hmm
[12:32:34] <methods> yea let me try that way i guess
[12:32:37] <lyrae> ngharo: ah thanks. was close!
[12:32:37] <VooDooNOFX_> ngharo: that'll work. thanks! :)
[12:33:07] <methods> i even tried to wrap it in an anonymouse function where i .apply(window) or window.document idk if that would help to reset a global scope but it didn't work either
[12:33:49] <_thumper_> First time an image appears in a div popup window it takes half a second to load. Then subsequent views of the images are instant. The image preloading script didnt work
[12:34:09] <_thumper_> When I refresh the page the images takes the half a second to load again
[12:34:10] <methods> would i use $(window) or $(window.document) ?
[12:34:46] <methods> would be nice if there was a way to see which event listeners are bound to an element from firebug too.. i couldn't find that in the dom browser..
[12:35:04] <ngharo> you can get jq events via $(el).data('events')
[12:38:35] <Smekman> Say i got a link on a site, and i wish that when it's hovered It'll display an overlay in a different colummn, with the product description of tehe link at say 180x400 px with a scrolling overflow, if any .. ANy suggestion on how?
[12:43:22] <chovy> in jquery ui when using drag-n-drop, how to I get the source and target containers?
[12:44:20] <igore> Thank you ngharo, I finally wrapped my head around this wrap issue and got it working.
[12:44:36] <AfroTurf> for(var i=0 ....) { $("#foo").fadeOut(speed, function() { alert(i);  }); why does i = -1 ?
[12:44:37] <igore> I'm passing a <div> and appending the form elements to that, avoiding the .wrap()
[12:45:00] <ngharo> igore: kewl
[12:45:01] <igore> Thank you again and all others who helped with this stubborn issue.
[12:45:20] <lyrae> If i have a bunch of divs with IDs, how do i get the one with a certain ID? is find() the right function to use?
[12:45:27] <AfroTurf> and can i reference "i" another way?
[12:45:41] <igore> I've been a lone coder of a cool WordPress plugin and after 4 months problems like this really de-rail my already low motivation
[12:45:48] <ngharo> AfroTurf: can you create a fiddle?  see ?p
[12:45:49] <bot-t> AfroTurf, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:45:55] <AfroTurf> sure 1 sec
[12:46:24] <ngharo> lyrae: you can just use the normal selector... $('#id')
[12:47:01] <ngharo> find searches all descendants of the object you're calling it on
[12:47:02] <lyrae> ngharo: to be honest, it's not an ID. It's a custom id such as <div myID='2'>
[12:47:35] <ngharo> that's an attribute.  $('div[myID="2"]')
[12:47:52] <methods> hm useing $(window) and $(window.document) didn't seem to help at all
[12:48:25] <lyrae> i see. thank you
[12:49:50] <AfroTurf> ngharo: http://jsfiddle.net/SJg8x/
[12:53:25] <AfroTurf> ngharo: i suppose i could always write data to the ul to to track "i".. but i would think i wouldn't have to do that
[12:56:50] <methods> you know perhaps it's the callback it self that expects the global scope to be the window when it's not.. is there a way to execute a function with it's global scope changed ? i thought .apply(window) would work ? but apply only changes "this" right ? it doesn't actually change a global window variable ...
[12:59:57] <Ungy> Hello I am getting a bug in jQuery in the uncompressed version it is line 6710 name.replace is not a function so I am assuming that name shoudl be a string but is not
[13:01:06] <SandroSantos> hey guys, how is possible to print a html document without the header and footer, by programming?
[13:01:24] <Ungy> say what?
[13:01:51] <blazedd> I'm trying to make an AJAX request to my own script while on a JSON page. This is same domain ajax via SSL. The ajax request isn't even be started, much less create an error. Any thoughts?
[13:01:52] <Ungy> you want to print a html file removing your header and footer?
[13:02:31] <gasull> Is this onclick wrong?  I get 1 POST request and one GET request in Firefox when clicking on the link:  onclick="$('#reactivate_form').submit();return false;"
[13:03:06] <blazedd> SandroSantos: You need to look into CSS
[13:03:24] <Ungy> gasull what is the onclick attached to?
[13:03:28] <blazedd> SandroSantos: You can use CSS to hide and restyle the css for printed items
[13:03:44] <SandroSantos> blazedd: thanks a lot
[13:03:45] <Misiur> Hi. I need to create file upload by dragging file onto window area (like http://min.us ). I've found http://gokercebeci.com/dev/droparea and http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/ but it creates only small box based on file input. How to connect whole window with file input?
[13:04:00] <gasull> Ungy, the onclick is in an anchor tag inside of the form #reactivate_form
[13:04:02] <blazedd> SandroSantos: here is a good starting point http://www.onextrapixel.com/2009/05/05/how-to-create-a-simple-print-css-for-your-site/
[13:04:55] <SandroSantos> blazedd: thanks again
[13:06:09] <gasull> Ungy: Oh, it seems a problem with my middleware in Django.  Nevermind.  Thanks.
[13:06:11] <Ungy> SandrosSantos <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="print" href="print.css"> in print.css div#header, div#footer {display:none;}
[13:07:04] <ngharo> AfroTurf: you can use $(this).index().  http://jsfiddle.net/SJg8x/2/
[13:07:33] <AfroTurf> ngharo: ah ok thanks.. i just test using data and it works :)
[13:08:20] <Eviltwin> ngharo: .find("li:eq("+i+")") is slower than .find("li").eq(i)
[13:09:45] <AfroTurf> Eviltwin: i'll use eq.(i) then
[13:09:57] <blazedd> nvm found my problem
[13:10:00] <blazedd> imma derp
[13:10:58] <Eviltwin> blazedd: It's okay, you're not the ony one
[13:11:00] <Eviltwin> only*
[13:17:03] <methods> var scope={"window": window}; scope.prototype=window;  (function(){  $("#blah",window.document).trigger("keyup");  }).apply(scope);
[13:17:07] <methods> not even that worked.. I'm about to give up
[13:17:42] <methods> window above references the other window
[13:17:54] <Eviltwin> What the hell?
[13:18:06] <Eviltwin> What are you trying to do?
[13:18:31] <methods> run some code and trick it into thinking it's in the other window's global scope
[13:19:27] <methods> it's crazy cause the selector can find the element but if you look at .data('events') it's emptyâ€¦
[13:20:51] <methods> but it works fine if the code is ran from the window it self
[13:20:57] <AfroTurf> can i store a function in data() and then trigger it?
[13:21:27] <chrisinajar> AfroTurf: yes
[13:22:11] <AfroTurf> chrisinajar: ("foo").data("hello", function() { alert("hi"); }); $("foo).data("hello"); ?
[13:22:19] <chrisinajar> yup
[13:22:41] <methods> i need to execute jquery with global scope set to the window variable
[13:24:01] <Eviltwin> Why?
[13:24:18] <_thumper_> $.fancybox.close() How do I delay that for some seconds?
[13:24:29] <Eviltwin> _thumper_: setTimeout
[13:24:30] <AfroTurf> chrisinajar: hmm can't seem to get it to work
[13:25:09] <AfroTurf> chrisinajar: i see it in the data().. it just won't fire
[13:25:54] <chrisinajar> AfroTurf: define wont work
[13:26:10] <methods> Eviltwin:  in selenium (ui testing framework) it controls the app window from another window .. it offers ability to use jquery to find elements.. and it offers ability to execute javascript .. but the javascript executes from the controlling window not the main window with the application.. and jquery doesn't seem to work properly when it's not based in the window
[13:26:34] <_thumper_> setTimeout is glitching an image load for some reason
[13:26:46] <chrisinajar> _thumper_: it's probably something else :P
[13:26:48] <AfroTurf> chrisinajar: $("ul").data("func", function() { alert("hello"); } $("ul").data("func"); doesn't alert anything
[13:27:04] <chrisinajar> AfroTurf: because you never ran the function
[13:27:12] <chrisinajar> AfroTurf: $("ul").data("func")();
[13:27:17] <AfroTurf> ah thx
[13:27:24] <Eviltwin> methods: Is there a reason you're not using $("...",<the window.document you want>)
[13:27:27] <chrisinajar> AfroTurf: or $("ul").data("func")("here", "are", "some", "params");
[13:27:52] <Eviltwin> methods: jQuery saves the window when it's instantiated
[13:27:58] <AfroTurf> aaah thank you!
[13:28:04] <Spadeski>  Sup everyone
[13:28:17] <chrisinajar> procrastinating.
[13:29:08] <ngharo> methods: hope this helps http://jsfiddle.net/3hCTt/
[13:30:21] <methods> Eviltwin: i tried that many times in the examples above.. it still doens't work .. actually i just got it tow ork by doing window.eval but as we know that's nasty..
[13:30:46] <methods> hm it saves the windowâ€¦
[13:31:07] <methods> maybe then i need to do something like window.$() instead of $() since both windows have jquery
[13:31:29] <Eviltwin> Oh, the other one has jQuery?
[13:31:32] <methods> yep
[13:31:33] <Eviltwin> I thought only this one did
[13:31:35] <Eviltwin> Then way
[13:31:37] <Eviltwin> yeah*
[13:31:40] <methods> yea sorry it's really confusing
[13:31:40] <Eviltwin> <other window>.$
[13:31:59] <Eviltwin> But you can probably do window.$ = <other window>.$;
[13:32:07] <Eviltwin> And then use $
[13:32:08] <methods> and the function that i pass my code to gets executed in a local scope with window set to the other windowâ€¦ that also adds confusion
[13:32:40] <methods> because it's only a local scope.. so if i do  window.some_func() that window is not going to see my local window variable..
[13:33:07] <methods> but i imagine the js vm is running some_func() with global scope set to the calling window
[13:33:17] <methods> not the target window
[13:33:22] <methods> see what I'm saying ?
[13:33:39] <AfroTurf> chrisinajar: i'm also trying to make my own callback function this.hello("param", function() { alert("hello"); }).  i can't seem to to get the func part to fire "hello": function(arg, func) {}
[13:34:28] <ngharo> methods: see my fiddle above for how to scope your new window
[13:34:44] <methods> yea i was just looking but let me test window.$( first
[13:35:18] <Eviltwin> AfroTurf: see ?demo
[13:35:19] <bot-t> AfroTurf, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[13:36:33] <methods> wooO!!! window.$( works too..
[13:36:45] <AfroTurf> k 1 sec
[13:36:48] <methods> i wonder if there was a way to set $() in that localscope without destroying the jquery that's running in the parrent window ?
[13:37:13] <methods> actually it's been a while i forget.. how is it even possible to use $() ? like $ is a valid variable name ?
[13:37:22] <Eviltwin> methods: (function($) { ... })(otherWindow.$);
[13:37:32] <methods> if so then i could just use var to make it local right ? so like   var $ = window.$
[13:37:54] <methods> i don't think that would always work though
[13:38:20] <Engin> is there a form validation plugin that utulizes attirbutes ? i.e. <input ... validate="string" minlength="3"> ?
[13:38:30] <methods> because what if the body of that function called another function that tried to use $ ? which $ would it hit ??? it would hit the global scoped one.. not the one in your wrappers local scope
[13:38:53] <rogdev> there is the Validation plugin for jQuery
[13:38:54] <methods> i guess same is true of var $ = window.$ then ?
[13:39:01] <Engin> maybe i should googled the question first :)
[13:39:13] <rogdev> u just need to put on the class: required...
[13:39:57] <rogdev> (sw)
[13:40:02] <methods> ngharo:  your example didn't work though because like i said they already set "window" to the child window for you and nothing was working properly â€¦
[13:40:49] <methods> let me go and see how they even do this ..
[13:41:25] <Eviltwin> ?
[13:41:30] <zoran119> hey, should .attr("meta:index") give me the index of an array input (book[2] for example)?
[13:41:31] <Eviltwin> How they even do what?
[13:41:42] <methods> how they call the js i send to them
[13:41:52] <Eviltwin> zoran119: The index relative to what?
[13:42:26] <methods> http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-remote-control/0.9.2/doc/java/com/thoughtworks/selenium/Selenium.html#getEval%28java.lang.String%29
[13:42:33] <AfroTurf> Eviltwin: ah i got it!!
[13:42:34] <AfroTurf> thx
[13:43:09] <zoran119> Eviltwin: not sure what it is relative to, but i just want 2 out of <input type="text" name="book[2]"> (the name index)
[13:46:33] <rogdev> zoran, u can just add an id to the text input, let's say: id="tindex" and then do alert( $("#tindex").attr(name) )
[13:46:42] <rogdev> this will show u the name attribute value
[13:47:05] <ymmot> should i use prop or attr to get the id of an element
[13:47:29] <rogdev> ymmot attr
[13:47:55] <ymmot> thanks
[13:48:04] <methods> Eviltwin:       script = String.format("(function() { %s })();", script)
[13:48:04] <methods>         .replaceAll("\\bwindow\\.", "selenium.browserbot.getCurrentWindow().")
[13:48:04] <methods>         .replaceAll("\\bdocument\\.", "selenium.browserbot.getDocument().");
[13:48:11] <methods> bam that's the java code
[13:48:24] <joikus> can I programmatically select an <li> from a jqueryui selectable list ?
[13:48:31] <joikus>  $('#formfields_selectable li:last').addClass('ui-selected').click();   did not work
[13:49:07] <methods> that might even be bad cause i mean \bwindow might match something like whatever.window. which might not be desired
[13:49:26] <zoran119> let me give you the whole story (i think i'm doing it the hard way)...
[13:50:00] <zoran119> i have a div which has 2 text inputs: book[0] and author[0]
[13:50:02] <rogdev> Windows to me: ur windows need to restart.. Damn!
[13:50:34] <zoran119> then, when the user clicks a button i use jquery to clone this row to another row underneath
[13:50:52] <zoran119> but now i have book[0] and another book[0]
[13:51:12] <zoran119> i need to increment the index in the newly inserted div to from 0 to 1
[13:51:20] <zoran119> so that i get book[0] and book[1]
[13:51:48] <zoran119> and this needs to happen every time the user clicks the button which adds a new row
[13:53:16] <zoran119> so, the question is, how do i increment the index?
[13:55:51] <chrisinajar> zoran119: general IRC tip, enter is not a punctuation key.
[13:56:24] <chrisinajar> zoran119: also, your question doesn't make any sense
[13:56:25] <yaazkal> Hello there I have a div that contains other divs... I want to select the one that NOT have a specified class. Let's say that all the divs has the "commonClass" and only one doesn't have the "someClass" the div what I want to select I'm trying $('.commonClass:not(.someClass)') but seems to not work (PS: I'm using the selector in a .find())
[13:58:35] <chrisinajar> yaazkal: $('.commonClass').not('[class="someClass"]')
[14:00:58] <yaazkal> chrisinajar, let me try
[14:02:08] <cornfeed> can i do something like var id = "0";  $("#opt"+id).blah  ?
[14:02:27] <cornfeed> so it is looking for #opt0
[14:05:28] <fr4nk> hi there

[14:13:16] <d3v1an7> hey peeps. I've set my site background to click through to an ad with $('body').click(function() { window.open(click_url, '_blank'); });
[14:13:43] <d3v1an7> problem is, it is still clicking though if I click on the content div.
[14:14:27] <d3v1an7> links work fine, but if I click anywhere else (text/etc) within the content, it still clicks though,
[14:17:11] <fourcolors> Hi, I'm trying to bind the "DOMAttrModified" event however it gets called every time instead of when DOMAttrModified is called
[14:17:13] <fourcolors> for exame
[14:17:20] <fourcolors> example I have something that looks like this:
[14:17:28] <fourcolors>           kid.on("DOMAttrModified."+ kid.id, console.log("Attribute modifed"));
[14:17:34] <snover> fourcolors: stop using that event. it is deprecated.
[14:17:38] <fourcolors> where var kid = $( this )
[14:17:41] <snover> and not supported in all browsers.
[14:17:55] <fourcolors> snover: how can I tell if some of my attributes have changed?
[14:18:02] <snover> you canâ€™t right now.
[14:18:04] <fourcolors> it was recommended to me in the javascript channel sorry ;)
[14:18:23] <snover> nice of them to give you a solution that does not work
[14:18:42] <fourcolors> do you have any recommendations on how to do this?
[14:18:44] <M4d3L> what is the event when we exit a focus from field?
[14:19:23] <velts> M4d3L: blur ?
[14:19:40] <MaGuyver> .focusout() event
[14:19:55] <M4d3L> ty
[14:20:08] <velts> fourcolors: what exactly in your dom are you checking to see if it has changed
[14:20:15] <velts> form elements?
[14:20:46] <velts> or if anything in the DOM has changed..
[14:20:58] <fourcolors> velts: I have a google map that has a data-lat and data-lng attribute that get updated when you drag the marker around. I'm using a dirty form plugin I created to detect any changes in the form
[14:21:26] <fourcolors> velts: my form lets you pick a location with the map and I need to make sure they don't navigate away from the page before they saved their data
[14:21:29] <M4d3L> and how I change the value of an input?  $(element).value = 54?
[14:21:41] <jrm2k6> hi all, when I moved a li item on click the css property display : inline is not applied, I can't find why : http://pastebin.com/fMpcNBbV
[14:21:46] <Taar779> M4d3L: .val()
[14:21:54] <velts> $(element).val('MYNEWVAL');
[14:22:29] <velts> fourcolors: why not just saving the point on a mouse up or something?
[14:22:54] <MaGuyver> clear
[14:22:54] <velts> so as soon as they drag their pin to a location save that info
[14:23:11] <fourcolors> you mean ajax style?
[14:23:24] <velts> yah
[14:23:36] <fourcolors> hum. that would be a nice solution.
[14:23:44] <velts> jrm2k6: you need to stop the click event
[14:24:07] <jrm2k6> velts, how i could do that?
[14:24:18] <velts> return false;
[14:24:19] <Taar779> jrm2k6: because the DOM object you are trying to set the css too doesn't exist
[14:24:35] <velts> yah, assuming your selectors are correct..
[14:24:52] <jrm2k6> hm
[14:24:53] <velts> else, you are just taking the user to the href destination
[14:26:55] <velts> fourcolors: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/v2/events.html
[14:27:14] <velts> you can add event listeners to the google map
[14:27:44] <jrm2k6> Taar779, so how could I manage the inline displaying of my li?
[14:27:57] <fourcolors> velts: oh, thats perfect I an just say when dragged to call the .change() event on my map
[14:28:05] <fourcolors> perfect thanks velts good idea
[14:28:18] <velts> np, hope it works
[14:28:21] <jrm2k6> because, I agree that the DOM objects doesn"t exists when I do $(blabla) but I don't know how to apply the display inline after
[14:29:47] <velts> jrm2k6: you are creating your list item wrong
[14:30:03] <jrm2k6> why?
[14:30:12] <jrm2k6> how should i do?
[14:30:40] <velts> var new_li = $('<li/>', { 'id': $(this).attr('id'), 'css': { 'display
[14:31:11] <velts> let me pastebin it
[14:31:16] <velts> two secs
[14:31:18] <jrm2k6> oh yeah thank you
[14:34:53] <luizribeiro> hey. anyone here has ever setup a .load() callback for a <object> tag that loads a SVG file?
[14:35:02] <luizribeiro> I've been trying to do that with no success.
[14:39:03] <ymmot> in a jquery widget i am using .on to bind click events (declared in the _create method), but any new elements don't get bound. Any ideas?
[14:39:36] <velts> jrm2k6: http://pastebin.com/SCDFWr3T
[14:40:06] <velts> i took out that input stuff just for local testing
[14:40:38] <Swim2000> do you guys prefer jsfiddle or gist
[14:40:42] <velts> also i appened a _new to the new li because the old id would remain on the page
[14:41:46] <ymmot> interesting that .live does work correctly
[14:42:32] <velts> ymmot: how does it not work correctly? and what version of jquery are you using?
[14:42:34] <fourcolors> velts: worked like a charm
[14:42:53] <_thumper_> Is there some Jquery so I can replace a checkbox with an image?
[14:43:07] <_thumper_> Image for checked/Another for unchecked
[14:43:08] <jrm2k6> thx velts I check it
[14:43:13] <ymmot> velts: the click event doesn't fire, 1.7
[14:43:16] <jrm2k6> ok velst thx, but I havent found this notation in the documentation
[14:43:17] <velts> fourcolors: there was like three issues, but basically the main issue i think was that you were not copying the text, so you would just append an empty li
[14:43:49] <fourcolors> velts: I think this was for someone else
[14:43:49] <velts> ymmot: syntax changed in 1.7 but the old on method should still work
[14:43:55] <fourcolors> velts: ^
[14:44:10] <velts> oh right may bad
[14:44:13] <velts> nice one
[14:44:28] <ymmot> velts: didn't on replace live in 1.7
[14:44:35] <velts> ymmot: new syntax is .on
[14:44:41] <velts> yah
[14:44:50] <velts> works like a charm
[14:45:09] <jrm2k6> velts, stuff you give works like a charm
[14:45:30] <velts> $('#container').on('click', 'a.liveElementSector', function(){});
[14:45:56] <velts> #container can be just 'body' too
[14:47:06] <big_swimmer> http://jsfiddle.net/c8Zfe/2/
[14:47:10] <ymmot> i am leaving out the selector parameter
[14:47:21] <big_swimmer> i'm parsing this json and making a filesystem like tree out of it
[14:47:43] <big_swimmer> and i'm trying to use jqueryui sortable so that i can rearange the nodes without children
[14:47:45] <velts> yah without the selector param its just a .click
[14:47:58] <velts> the old .click is not .on('click'
[14:48:08] <velts> .live and delgate need the selector param
[14:48:32] <big_swimmer> and now i'm trying to make it so that while i'm hovering, i want to able to open a node whit children
[14:48:33] <velts> *not=now
[14:48:40] <big_swimmer> but that's not working
[14:49:15] <velts> big_swimmer: do you have a link to your code?
[14:49:29] <big_swimmer> http://jsfiddle.net/c8Zfe/2/
[14:49:45] <ymmot> i'm doing $("#selector .delete").on("click.crudtablerow", function(e) {}
[14:50:25] <ymmot> any elements added with class delete don't get bound
[14:50:25] <velts> ymmot: sytax error
[14:50:51] <velts> firstly what is crudtablerow?
[14:51:08] <ymmot> namespace of custom widget
[14:51:24] <velts> $("#selector").on("click", ".delete", function(e) { });
[14:51:55] <velts> is the same as $("#selector .delete").live(function(e) { });
[14:52:03] <velts> err
[14:52:13] <velts> $("#selector .delete").live('click', function(e) { });
[14:52:55] <ymmot> velts: i understand now, thanks
[14:53:14] <velts> np, good luck
[14:53:44] <velts> big_swimmer: trying to figure out your code
[14:54:17] <big_swimmer> i know, there's a bit there, parseDocumentOutline is just for rendering the json
[14:54:34] <big_swimmer> should have little to nothing to do with my issue, i just included it for completeness
[14:55:49] <big_swimmer> my issue is trying to open paths while dragging nodes that don't have children
[14:55:57] <big_swimmer> WHILE being the keyword
[14:56:37] <velts> huh?
[14:56:46] <velts> i thought you were having issues with hover
[14:57:29] <big_swimmer> yeah, i'm using the jquery ui sortable
[14:57:53] <big_swimmer> and while i'm dragging a div i can't get it to trigger the mouseenter and mouse leave events on another div
[14:58:04] <big_swimmer> it seems to trigger randomly
[14:58:57] <velts> you are using jquery 1.7?
[14:59:43] <big_swimmer> yep
[14:59:59] <big_swimmer> i'm getting 1.7 off google cdn
[15:00:17] <big_swimmer> and i downloaded ui 1.8.9 with everything in it
[15:00:24] <big_swimmer> 1.8.16
[15:00:38] <iamcurio> is it possible to cross-fade a page into anotherâ€¦ for example i am on the home page and when i click the link for about it cross fads. or does all the content need to be loaded into one page to work?
[15:01:30] <big_swimmer> iamcurio: you would need to preload the next page into a div or other container
[15:03:07] <big_swimmer> it's especially good if you can guess what page they are gonna use next, just like the cache manifest
[15:03:34] <min|dvir|us> Hi. Is there a 'positioning complete' event?
[15:03:38] <min|dvir|us> Or something like that?
[15:04:10] <min|dvir|us> I need to do something when my element has its final default position.
[15:04:29] <big_swimmer> you can do offset()
[15:04:39] <big_swimmer> for the absolute position
[15:04:46] <min|dvir|us> I know that.
[15:04:54] <min|dvir|us> I need to know when I can do it.
[15:06:23] <big_swimmer> you're being crazy vague
[15:11:14] <box> hello
[15:11:47] <lyrae> I click a button and I append a <li> to a ul. I have an edit in place plugin that will not work when i click on the <li>. However, it does work on <li>s that were already there when dom loaded (not dynamically appended). why is this?
[15:13:26] <big_swimmer> lyrae: did you try reupdating the on() once all the li's are loaded
[15:13:55] <lyrae> what do you mean reupdating?
[15:14:02] <lyrae> I do add them with .live() though, if that helps anythign
[15:14:14] <ShaunR> I have a element that I know the class name, but then two elements down their is a <p> element and it has no class or id but i want to remove it.  Is there a way to remove the first occurance of <p> after that element that i know the class name of?

[15:28:00] <elidupuis> hey all. i'm having an issue with $.ajax (in IE and Opera). I"m trying to do a cross domain POST and I get a "No Transport" error. any thoghts?
[15:28:56] <min|dvir|us> I want to call a function when an element's offsetTop does not depend on any other element.
[15:28:59] <min|dvir|us> Is that possible?
[15:29:03] <big_swimmer> elidupuis: did you try jsonp
[15:30:09] <elidupuis> it's just a POST... can i send data as jsonp? i thought that was usually for data coming back from the server...
[15:31:27] <big_swimmer> i'm not certain
[15:31:35] <wkmanire> elidupuis: That is correct. Servers don't normally operate a JSONP interface...
[15:31:42] <wkmanire> elidupuis: Can you post your original question again?
[15:33:07] <elidupuis> wkmanire: i'm trying to POST to an external server using $.ajax. and I'm getting a "No Transport" error. only IE and Opera
[15:33:33] <wkmanire> You can't POST to a 3rd party domain.
[15:33:40] <wkmanire> You'll need to send the data via a GET request.
[15:34:48] <monstaRtruck> hey guys wats up onkeydown
[15:34:53] <elidupuis> really? i'll give that a try. any reason it works with POST in webkit/firefox?
[15:34:59] <cambazz> hello, how can i get the text of an option, that is selected
[15:35:17] <cambazz> $('#myselect').val() gives the selected value, but not the text
[15:35:40] <big_swimmer>  http://jsfiddle.net/c8Zfe/5/
[15:35:42] <big_swimmer> I'm trying to use on("mousenter") and on("mouseleave")  while i'm doing a drag via jquery ui sortable but they refuse to trigger predictably
[15:37:09] <monstaRtruck> big_swimmer is that the bubble proof one
[15:37:51] <big_swimmer> which one
[15:38:04] <monstaRtruck> there are 2 mouse events
[15:38:12] <monstaRtruck> u want the bubble proof one
[15:38:48] <big_swimmer> monstaRtruck: you me mouseenter and mouseover?
[15:38:57] <monstaRtruck> yes
[15:39:09] <monstaRtruck> i think u got the correct one
[15:39:09] <big_swimmer> k, i'll try overinstead of enter
[15:39:18] <monstaRtruck> but try it anyways lol
[15:39:24] <big_swimmer> +1
[15:39:32] <monstaRtruck> if it doesnt work its ur code
[15:39:56] <monstaRtruck> so just make a real time debug window
[15:40:09] <big_swimmer> nah, that didn't do it
[15:40:35] <big_swimmer> well in the browser i'm using the console for debuging but i'm not getting any errors
[15:40:50] <monstaRtruck> no like poll ur stuff
[15:40:50] <big_swimmer> the hover just seems to block the mouseenter.
[15:41:00] <monstaRtruck> oh
[15:41:04] <jrm2k6> I had some li by using append on a ul list, after creation of the li element, but the click on the new generated li element is not detected, is it because it is not well-added in the DOM or something like that?
[15:41:09] <monstaRtruck> e.preventDefault();
[15:41:40] <big_swimmer> what am i preventing?
[15:41:46] <big_swimmer> i'm using all divs
[15:41:50] <monstaRtruck> the browser crap
[15:42:12] <big_swimmer> i'll give it a shot
[15:42:18] <monstaRtruck> browser has its own things that it does
[15:42:29] <monstaRtruck> when u mess w any controls
[15:42:39] <njam> Hi! I'm trying to bind a custom event ($.event.special) only once with one(): http://jsfiddle.net/Y3jpM/1/ Does anyone see what I'm doing wrong? Or is there a bug?
[15:44:41] <elidupuis> member:wkmanire: i'm still getting the same error in IE and opera. The GET request is working in webkit tho. http://liftslice3.com/ama-ecard/ajax-test.html
[15:45:25] <jrm2k6> should i put the event delegation when I create some new elements in Jquery or at the beginning of my script?
[15:45:53] <jrm2k6> because event delegation just kind of 'instantiate' some precise events on precise elements right?
[15:46:19] <big_swimmer> jrm2k6: if you want to be really good you can return the items that you generate and then just do an on() on them
[15:46:24] <elidupuis> wkmanire: copy and paste error! i seem to get the same error with GET. see above if you don't mind.
[15:46:58] <jrm2k6> big_swimmer on() is better than live() or delegate()?
[15:47:24] <jrm2k6> that means if I do : var new_elem = $(bblabla creation)
[15:47:51] <jrm2k6> list.append(new_elem), should I do the 'on()' thing directly on new elem? just after his creation?
[15:48:21] <big_swimmer> jrm2k6: on() should only effect elements that exist at the moment
[15:48:45] <big_swimmer> delegate/live work on every time the page gets a click
[15:49:06] <jrm2k6> so I don't really understand how I could use on() in my case
[15:49:51] <big_swimmer> if you return the set of newly instantiated objects
[15:50:03] <big_swimmer> i'm just saying if you felt like being super efficient
[15:51:20] <Eviltwin> One thing: Please don't ever use .live
[15:51:27] <Eviltwin> .delegate can do everything .live can do and more
[15:51:46] <Eviltwin> And in 1.7+, .on is the new better way to do .bind and .delegate
[15:51:54] <jrm2k6> but the on is supposed to work as soon as the li element created is added to the ul list right? because the new element added is now existent
[15:52:24] <Eviltwin> If you do var e=$("<div id='foo'>");$("#foo").on(...) that won't work
[15:52:41] <Eviltwin> But if you do var e = $("<div id='foo'>").on(...) that should work just fine
[15:52:46] <Wizek> Hello
[15:53:21] <jrm2k6> alright Eviltwin
[15:53:36] <jrm2k6> and why in one case it will work and not in the other
[15:53:41] <Wizek> What's the best practise to inject a .css file onto my page with jQuerY?
[15:54:21] <Wizek> I'm currently trying $('<link href="'+cssFilePath+'"></link>').appendTo('head') with mixed results
[15:54:26] <Eviltwin> jrm2k6: The first one creates an element but doesn't add it to the document yet. The $("#foo") searches the document for that element and (obviously) doesn't find it because you haven't added it yet
[15:54:49] <Wizek> Sometimes the document gets the style, somethimes it doesn't
[15:54:57] <Eviltwin> jrm2k6: The second one creates an element  and then the .on tells jQuery to bind the listeners to that set of (newly created) elements.
[15:55:15] <Eviltwin> It doesn't try to search the document for the element
[15:55:16] <jrm2k6> so in my case, I create a li element, I just want to remove it when I click on it after he moved, I just have to do $(</li>..{}).on('click'..){ remove($(this));}
[15:56:09] <Eviltwin> jrm2k6: Can explain "when I click on it after he moved"?
[15:56:13] <Eviltwin> I don't understand
[15:56:41] <jrm2k6> hm, in fact I click on a li in one list of my page, and it 'hides' the item clicked, and create the same item in another list (at the bottom)
[15:56:44] <monstaRtruck> im havin sum issues
[15:56:47] <jrm2k6> I want to do the opposit
[15:57:12] <jrm2k6> opposite, when I click on the item in the list at bottom, I want to remove it, and make the old one appears
[15:57:21] <monstaRtruck>  $('#test_div').keydown( function(e) {
[15:57:34] <monstaRtruck> its not picking it up
[15:57:43] <monstaRtruck> but does $(document)
[15:58:38] <erichynds> jrm2k6: why don't you just take the li and append/prepend it to the ul?
[15:58:44] <Eviltwin> jrm2k6: First, to demonstrate that this works: http://jsfiddle.net/5Gs8b/
[15:59:43] <joshsmith> I've got a jQuery UI autocomplete, and anytime that someone blurs from the input for that autocomplete, I want to close it
[15:59:45] <jrm2k6> erichynds, because I haven't thought about it
[15:59:56] <joshsmith> but I'm running into a problem
[15:59:57] <jrm2k6> Eviltwin, ok that's what I thought when I read your solution
[16:00:08] <joshsmith> if you click on the selection within the autocomplete dropdown itself
[16:00:16] <monstaRtruck> or at least how do i have it $(document).keydown but other input fields also work
[16:00:22] <joshsmith> that counts as a blur, and closes the autocomplete before the select method fires
[16:00:25] <joshsmith> any thoughts?
[16:01:05] <jrm2k6> erichynds, for me the simplest was to hide the first one and create a new one, considered as the second one
[16:01:33] <erichynds> jrm2k6: true. append/prepend will move the elements around, which sounds like what you're trying to accomplish
[16:02:12] <jrm2k6> erichynds, I check that in the doc
[16:02:19] <jrm2k6> I know about append, not about prepend
[16:02:48] <jrm2k6> hm erichynds prepend is to add something as first element of a list
[16:02:56] <jrm2k6> me it to pass from one list, to another
[16:03:14] <erichynds> jrm2k6: prependTo()
[16:03:50] <jrm2k6> god
[16:04:06] <jrm2k6> thanks erichynds , as always i want to go too fast
[16:04:17] <erichynds> np
[16:04:32] <Eviltwin> jrm2k6: Copying elements isn't necessarily the best way to do it but is this what you were looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/5Gs8b/1/
[16:05:18] <jrm2k6> Eviltwin, so with appendTo, it is more like a 'move' than a copy, it is better for memory issues and some stuff right?
[16:05:48] <erichynds> no, it's just a lot easier
[16:07:14] <Eviltwin> jrm2k6: If you move the elements instead of copying them, it's arguably more memory efficient
[16:07:20] <Taar779> jrm2k6, it can be "easier" on the browser to move Elements than to destory and recreate them.
[16:07:24] <Eviltwin> But the problem is restoring them to their original position
[16:07:33] <jrm2k6> I don't care about the position
[16:07:34] <Eviltwin> Which I believed is what you wanted to do
[16:07:44] <Eviltwin> Oh, I thought order mattered or something
[16:08:08] <jrm2k6> Nope, not for now
[16:08:36] <Eviltwin> So if they click the last item, you want to move it to the top of the list
[16:08:43] <jrm2k6> so we agree if I want to keep the order, the move stuff is not enought, the copying thing and make it the first one hidden is necessary
[16:08:43] <Eviltwin> And if they click any other item
[16:08:47] <Eviltwin> You want to move it to the bottom?
[16:08:52] <jrm2k6> yep
[16:10:50] <jrm2k6> ok, thank you guys, I will make it later! That helps a lot! (beginner in jquery..) :)
[16:11:34] <Eviltwin> jrm2k6: http://jsfiddle.net/5Gs8b/2/
[16:11:39] <jrm2k6> thx
[16:12:25] <shaft0> I've got a colorbox script running, it's a lightbox type script, basically it's a gallery that pops up in a lightbox, and I'd like when the user clicks on an image to have the lightbox change to that image and be able to scroll through them that way.  The images in the gallery are loaded via ajax, and so the bit of code that says "hey this is lightbox stuff, call the lightbox script for this"
[16:12:25] <shaft0> doesn't fire the second time.  Is there a way to ensure that a function (or bind event) works on dynamically loaded content?
[16:13:30] <shaft0> I guess a better question would be this.  I can use "bind" or "delegate" to ensure the click function works, but when $.colorbox() handles the clicking, is there a way to override that?
[16:16:33] <Eviltwin> shaft0: Sorry, don't work with colorbox
[16:16:56] <Eviltwin> shaft0: Have you browsed the list of settings? http://jacklmoore.com/colorbox/
[16:20:31] <chuck_tes> Hi. Sorry to bother you. I know about web design but not too much. I downloaded a template for a small portfolio website I want to make. I've been working ont he Homepage all day today and it came out nice. This template has html and a CSS to give it a little pizzazz. So I basically finished the homepage, and now I need to start on the other pages (about me, resume, contact) but I'm not really
[16:20:31] <chuck_tes> sure how to create/link the other pages?
[16:21:35] <chuck_tes> I basically opened dreamweaver and loaded te CSS and accompanying index.html and have been messing with the .html
[16:22:09] <ajpiano> chuck_tes: what led you to the #jquery irc channel ?
[16:22:57] <ajpiano> it's good that you are getting started but unfortunately, this isn't a general basics-of-web-development channel :)
[16:23:47] <chuck_tes> well, I have been browsing around for templates and like nice looking web content. I knwo that jquery is a plugin for webpages and its pretty rich in its instruction set. That is far and beyond the scope of what I am trying to accomplish. However, if this is a jquery room, I'm pretty sure html and CSS is pretty simple comapred to jquery.
[16:24:06] <chuck_tes> darn. is there a channel for that?
[16:25:23] <gnarf> chuck_tes: honestly, you wont find many people on IRC with enough patience to cover basics
[16:25:32] <gnarf> you'll get a lot of "RTFM" style responses
[16:25:56] <gnarf> there is this google video set tho that i think is good for html/css beginners, lemme see if i can find it
[16:26:50] <chuck_tes> lol, it was worth a shot.  i'm assuming RTFM means "read the ******* manual" lol. yes that woudl really help. I'll be here.
[16:27:25] <gnarf> http://code.google.com/edu/submissions/html-css-javascript/
[16:28:33] <chuck_tes> yess this is hat i'm looking for. like a simple logical explanation of how html css and webpage structure is created/maintained. not the tags and in depth stuff. thanks :)
[16:34:06] <_thumper_> Hello. I am using ImageTick to replace a checkbox with images. On Chrome when it lags half a second when changing from the unticked image to the ticked one, but not vice-versa
[16:34:14] <_thumper_> On Firefox is works perfectly, any ideas?
[16:34:36] <joshsmith> gnarf: finally a non-snarky and helpful response for an uber-noob
[16:34:46] * joshsmith golf claps
[16:34:57] <gnarf> joshsmith: ajpiano started it ;)
[16:35:16] <joshsmith> tru dat. ajpiano deserves some props, too
[16:35:27] <gnarf> even tho he DESTROYED plugins
[16:35:39] * gnarf silently cheers for the destruction though
[16:36:07] <joshsmith> gnarf: destroyed how? I'm not really up on jQuery news
[16:36:16] <gnarf> joshsmith: blog.jquery.com
[16:36:20] <gnarf> read the story yo
[16:36:22] <gnarf> :)
[16:37:09] <joshsmith> oh sweet
[16:37:16] <joshsmith> using package.json schemae is far better
[16:37:42] <joshsmith> harmony between the client-side and server-side ying and yang of js
[16:37:58] * joshsmith digs.
[16:38:34] <joshsmith> ughhh I wish there were just a simple JSON API for fulltext search of cities somewhere
[16:39:03] <joshsmith> instead I've spent all day hacking on the MaxMind data
[16:39:34] * joshsmith is uploading a 260MB MySQL table :(
[16:44:12] <aghouseh> im using a 'template' div and then using .clone(true) to add another 'row' to my area, but im losing all of the handlers and such bound to the UI tabs. is there a way to clone and also duplicate the binds?
[16:49:47] <someprimetime> how can i find out if a form was submitted by clicking the submit button or pressing enter?
[16:49:54] <someprimetime> i know i could check for a key code of the return button
[16:50:06] <someprimetime> along with a click of the input[type=submit]
[16:50:14] <someprimetime> but is there a method to handle both in one?
[16:55:21] <jrm2k6> hi  again
[16:55:55] <jrm2k6> http://pastebin.com/p53zeWW6 : the first appendTo move the item where i want, the second appendTo doesn't work, it append the item at the end of the same list
[16:56:12] <jrm2k6> it is the same code for both, I just invert the origin list and the destination list
[17:01:07] <jrm2k6> nobody :(
[17:03:29] <avalarion> does someone know a jquery solution for this: http://www.simpleviewer.net/postcardviewer/app/ ?
[17:05:32] <jrm2k6> someone knows about this strange behaviour ? http://pastebin.com/p53zeWW6 the second appendTo doesn't work, it appends at the end of the current list
[17:05:33] <lyrae> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/518177/ trying to get the .val() of an a text input..but when i alert it it alerts an object. howcome?
[17:07:23] <frenocha> this jquery thing... sure is fun.
[17:08:32] <jrm2k6> raaaa I can't understand this behaviour
[17:08:33] <jrm2k6> grrr
[17:10:14] <jrm2k6> ok maybe I get it, it is possible that when you do an appendTo the item which is appendTo something has still the origin parent as reference?
[17:11:02] <winterpk> Can someone help me with a quick regex?
[17:11:29] <winterpk> I need to find all % without 25 following it.
[17:12:48] <lyrae> ok weird. i got it
[17:13:03] <lyrae> when i alert it alerts as [object]. when log to console it shows the expected value
[17:13:24] <lyrae> winterpk: give me the string
[17:14:04] <jrm2k6> someone knows how to change the parent of an item/node?
[17:15:40] <lyrae> winterpk: %[^25]
[17:15:54] <winterpk> thank you
[17:16:15] <lyrae> winterpk:  this will help you, always =)  http://rubular.com/r/NcRyPxGt1z
[17:17:53] <lyrae> actually thats wrong but close enough
[17:20:08] <fission6> is there any javascript librry out there which makes collecting user experience metrics easy, such as how long on a page, buttons     â”‚ bpietro
[17:20:10] <fission6>                         | clicked, etc...
[17:21:11] <jrm2k6> someone knows about how to change the parent of a node in the DOM?
[17:21:30] <fission6> .parent()
[17:22:31] <jrm2k6> .parent() gives the name of the parent, doesn't change it
[17:22:34] <jrm2k6> i guess
[17:28:05] <fission6> are there any user action tracking jquery plugins
[17:45:46] <nezZario> so whaddya guys think about html5 ?
[17:45:54] <nezZario> think it's kind of backwards that it's not xml based
[17:50:00] <berndj> i have a Tabs inside a Dialog, and the tabs header wraps. neat way of making it all fit (i.e. without counting pixels)?
[17:53:07] <joshsmith> how should I deal with relative paths for $.ajax?
[17:53:50] <innociv> joshsmith, I use $.url() plugin.
[17:54:33] <innociv> What do you guys do when you have something that slides open and closed on hover?  If you keep hovering on and off it repeatedly, faster than the animation, the animations get queued up and keep going long after you stopped moving the mouse
[17:56:16] <innociv> Nevermind got it. put a var open, and open = false; on the animate callback when it's done closing it.
[17:56:36] <berndj> isn't there an animationStart/End yeah, something like that
[17:56:57] <innociv> Bah but it still doesn't work very well..
[17:57:00] <innociv> It can get stuck open.
[17:57:24] <joshsmith> innociv: oh you can do: window.location.protocol + '//' + window.location.host + window.location.pathname
[17:57:27] <innociv> Seems like that's the general idea, but it'll take a ton more code to work proper.
[17:57:50] <innociv> joshsmith, yep. I like that $.url plugin. It's essentially just those things with some jquerisms.
[17:57:56] <innociv> But that's all you need.
[17:58:23] <joshsmith> I knew I'd done that in the past
[18:20:18] <dogarrhea2> so i'm looking at the on() method.
[18:20:38] <dogarrhea2> i notice the documentation says "events".  so instead of just "click" how would I add a click and a mouseover?
[18:21:49] <dogarrhea2> ok a map
[18:29:07] <bartmax> how do someone knows if it's a good programmer
[18:29:10] <bartmax> ?
[18:30:15] <dogarrhea2> bartmax
[18:30:23] <bartmax> yes
[18:30:26] <dogarrhea2> first, they don't talk like a h1b indian like you
[18:30:43] <dogarrhea2> 2nd, they work for themselves and not for others.
[18:30:54] <dogarrhea2> this day and age "programmer" is not a career
[18:33:07] <bartmax> dogarrhea2: that doesn't answer my question. Let me rephrase it: how do I know if I'm a good programmer?
[18:33:46] <bartmax> and btw, what's a h1b indian? (I'm from South America, english is not my native, and I'm not an english expert)
[18:34:22] <snover> bartmax: if you have to ask, you probably are not
[18:34:23] <yamahaalex37> is jqueryUI popular here?
[18:34:23] <snover> i guess
[18:34:41] <dogarrhea2> no yamahaalex37
[18:34:41] <yamahaalex37> anyone have any idea wtfs wrong here
[18:34:44] <yamahaalex37> oh
[18:34:47] <yamahaalex37> is there a # for UI
[18:35:06] <dogarrhea2> yamahaalex37: the jqueryui people know that jqueryui is utterly broken
[18:35:10] <dogarrhea2> and are busy rewriting things
[18:35:15] <dogarrhea2> from scratch
[18:35:18] <yamahaalex37> dogarrhea2, is that true?
[18:35:19] <bartmax> snover: that doesn't have to be real. Actually, before with way less knownlodge, i didn't have to ask, i knew i was a good programmer :) now, i see in retrospective and i know i weren't. so, how does someone knows ? Trying to make a serious questing.
[18:35:21] <yamahaalex37> because i have a few bugs i think
[18:35:24] <yamahaalex37> or im doing things wrong
[18:35:27] <dogarrhea2> yes. so do I
[18:35:34] <dogarrhea2> you can even see them on their demo pages
[18:35:35] <yamahaalex37> http://eternaware.com/index.php/downloads/itemlist/category/3-joomla-extensions
[18:35:38] <yamahaalex37> lol
[18:35:44] <yamahaalex37> if you resize that div small, then make big again
[18:35:48] <yamahaalex37> the child div stays small
[18:36:01] <snover> bartmax: if the software you write is easily maintainable by people that are not you by the end of the project
[18:36:05] <snover> then you are a good programmer
[18:36:16] <innociv> How do I have a function with an ajax request in it return data from the ajax?
[18:36:20] <dogarrhea2> snover. i think it has to work too.
[18:36:30] <innociv> The whole asynchronous stuff is screwing me up.
[18:36:35] <innociv> I need it synchronous :(
[18:36:44] <bartmax> snover: that depends on the project ... also.
[18:36:45] <dogarrhea2> code maintainability is overrated. it's a pipe dream actually. people will rewrite things from scratch rather than work with old code
[18:36:55] <snover> dogarrhea2: ummm. no.
[18:37:04] <dogarrhea2> snover they do it all the time..
[18:37:07] <bartmax> dogarrhea2: depends... sometimes:YES, sometimes..NO
[18:37:09] <dogarrhea2> at big shops
[18:37:10] <snover> then obviously you do not write maintainable codeâ€¦
[18:37:20] <bartmax> snover: i was thinking the same ;)
[18:37:37] <yamahaalex37> is this most likely my error or jqueryUI bug
[18:37:38] <yamahaalex37> http://eternaware.com/index.php/downloads/item/1-content-rotate
[18:37:42] <bartmax> if the code is good, there's no need to rewrite it from scratch
[18:37:45] <yamahaalex37> the scroll is as longa s the page, not the div
[18:37:46] <dogarrhea2> why don't they ever modify ATM code then? if they want something new, they write something new
[18:38:00] <dogarrhea2> "let's go into the Cobol and muck around"
[18:38:58] <bartmax> whatever... still i don't know if im bad/normal/good/very good.... :(
[18:39:14] <dogarrhea2> they say you're worht whatever you're paid heh
[18:40:19] <bartmax> people who pays me think im the best :) ... doesn't count.
[18:40:20] <bartmax> :D
[18:40:41] <arepie> if i init a button with it's own id, is there any way to add an icon to it? eg: $('#button1').button(); how to add ui icon to it?
[18:41:17] <dogarrhea2> they throw away old cold all the time..
[18:41:20] <bartmax> If I should say what i think it's that I have a fast learning curve but never reach the top... normally i get bored and switch languages or the like.
[18:41:21] <dogarrhea2> code
[18:41:36] <dogarrhea2> case in point: we were using some software called IPIX.  based on applets
[18:41:38] <niftylettuce> jQuery easter egg website http://easteregg.in
[18:41:57] <dogarrhea2> we were trying to migrate this content over to a new CMS.  But as you know IPIX went bankrupt.
[18:42:19] <dogarrhea2> so. what do we do? we throw it away. if we want this 360 degree functionality we'll write it again.
[18:43:00] <dogarrhea2> code doesn't matter. functionality does.
[18:43:10] <dogarrhea2> people will throw away your code. it's a harsh industry
[18:43:21] <dogarrhea2> even if it's "maintainable"
[18:43:38] <dogarrhea2> and differences in language syntax? you can start a religious war over "maintainable"
[18:45:09] <bartmax> dogarrhea2: if that were the case, jquery should be rewritten next month. Sometimes it's worth it, sometimes it does not. When you have a framework/platform, there's no need to throw old code, maybe some
[18:46:10] <dogarrhea2> well they are deprecating the delegate code and replacing with on() so they are trying to get rid of some things.
[18:46:16] <dogarrhea2> they both almost do the same thing
[18:46:16] <bartmax> dogarrhea2: in the reality your are seeing/talking, it's probably the best to trash code and start from scratch. sometimes / somebusiness doesn't do that much. It just keep 'extending it'
[18:46:27] <dogarrhea2> i didn't say trash code and start from scratch
[18:46:47] <dogarrhea2> if it works
[18:47:11] <bartmax> dogarrhea2: mantain code means you can use your code base to get more functionality. right ?
[18:47:16] <thedeeno> Is there an easy way to append something x number of times?
[18:47:24] <dogarrhea2> they can even ignore the old code and write their on() functionality
[18:47:56] <yamahaalex37> can anyone pleeeease tell me why this div wont scroll
[18:47:57] <yamahaalex37> http://eternaware.com/index.php/downloads/item/1-content-rotate
[18:47:57] <thedeeno> built in way* rather
[18:47:59] <bartmax> dogarrhea2: but they are not trashing the whole core to change the on
[18:48:23] <dogarrhea2> they would if others weren't using it.
[18:48:34] <dogarrhea2> look at yui 2 and yui 3.. basically they're saying "yui 2 is dead"
[18:48:44] <dogarrhea2> it'll be around for some but they really want it to die.
[18:49:08] <yamahaalex37> can anyone pleeeease tell me why this div wont scroll
[18:49:10] <yamahaalex37> http://eternaware.com/index.php/downloads/item/1-content-rotate
[18:49:15] <bartmax> dogarrhea2: there are thousand of example of trashing all code, and thousand of examples of not trashing old code. that's the whole point of my argument. Sometimes it's ok, something it's not.
[18:49:22] <dogarrhea2> "ignore that old code. write something that runs parallel"
[18:49:38] <dogarrhea2> they don't go back and mess around with the old code.
[18:49:56] <dogarrhea2> reading code is too time consuming. it's not like some book.
[18:50:07] <bartmax> dogarrhea2: when you work with big ecommerce software, you'll remember me :)
[18:50:16] <dogarrhea2> i do work with big ecommerce software
[18:50:28] <dogarrhea2> our clients are Cailfornia prison systems hospitals and other such large entities
[18:50:38] <dogarrhea2> this is as SAAS-ish and enterprisy as you can get
[18:50:56] <dogarrhea2> when we reuse our old code guess what?  It's as broken as it was before.
[18:51:13] <dogarrhea2> and we get the same tickets and bugs in our ticketing system as the original old code..
[18:51:21] <snover> broken, unmaintainable code is thrown away? unthinkable
[18:51:49] <dogarrhea2> leave the unmaintainable out and you've got it
[18:52:04] <dogarrhea2> they don't throw away ATM code even though we all know Cobol is unmaintainable
[18:52:22] <dogarrhea2> if they want something new, they'll write something new and not muck around in old code
[18:52:48] <dogarrhea2> you don't "Maintain" code
[18:53:02] <dogarrhea2> it's there. people are afraid to touch it if it "works". new = new development
[18:53:12] <dogarrhea2> not modifying "maintainable" old code
[18:53:20] <dogarrhea2> especially if it works..
[18:54:35] <dogarrhea2> whens the last time you mucked around with ejb2 stuff? these days it's all spring and struts and hibernate and all that other stuff... you leave that old code alone. there's no maintainability
[18:54:56] <dogarrhea2> and everything in retrospect is "broken"
[18:55:06] <dogarrhea2> you leave it alone.
[18:56:19] <yamahaalex37> http://eternaware.com/index.php/downloads/item/1-content-rotate
[18:56:23] <yamahaalex37> can anyone pleeeease tell me why this div wont scroll
[18:56:51] <dogarrhea2> if you think that even 1 person is going to look at your code when you leave and say: "Wow this code is so great" you're delusional. even if you've followed every Camel case style/bracketing etc.
[19:01:16] <dogarrhea2> btw. if you use clone on a class of elements $(".something").clone() with more than one elment
[19:01:32] <dogarrhea2> say a <div> and an <img> with same class, what happens
[19:03:01] <Eviltwin> What do you expect happens?
[19:04:50] <coldhead> i expect to have to reinstall my browser
[19:07:32] <abjorn> coldhead!
[19:07:37] <abjorn> reinstall your everything!
[19:07:39] <coldhead> hey abjsy
[19:07:55] <abjorn> wheres that wiggla imsky. he should be in here more often
[19:08:22] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky HE SHOULD BE IN HERE MORE OFTEN SO I CAN TELL HIM THINGS
[19:08:23] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[19:08:37] <abjorn> wow that was a delay
[19:11:48] <coldhead> yay i fixed a thing
[19:11:52] <coldhead> thanks, float:left
[19:12:18] <coldhead> my idea of a good time on a friday afternoon is to sweat without aircon and fix a billion CSS aids
[19:20:33] <abjorn> but its not friday
[19:22:44] <Eviltwin> I'm looking for a plugin that accepts user-specified content and uses a stopPropagation for some event
[19:22:48] <Eviltwin> On the wrapper for that content
[19:23:07] <joshsmith> in coldhead land it's always Friday
[19:23:27] <rup3rt> do u know how to get a list of multiple ids from a dropdown menu? i.e var fleet_ids = $('form#fleet_chooser select#fleet_ids :selected').val(); <-- but this only selects the first selected. I need all those selected...
[19:23:39] <coldhead> actually it's always tuesday
[19:23:42] <coldhead> except today
[19:23:45] <coldhead> which is friday
[19:23:49] <coldhead> in several senses
[19:24:08] <joshsmith> it's Friday only in the less important parts of the world
[19:24:31] <joshsmith> oh, what am I talking about? I can't afford healthcare.
[19:24:33] <lyrae> how does one highlite text inside a text input?
[19:24:55] <joshsmith> click and drag, lyrae. click and drag
[19:24:55] <coldhead> $('form#fleet_chooser, #fleet_ids').find(':selected')
[19:25:24] <lyrae> joshsmith: how does a computer with no hands do it
[19:25:35] <joshsmith> lyrae: with its feet
[19:26:13] <tga> greetings
[19:26:51] <tga> when using tmpl how can I pass the current object as an onclick parameter?
[19:27:11] <y3di> has anyone messed around with google's closure templates?
[19:27:14] <tga> I tried something like onclick="remove_item($data)" but $data doesn't seem to be defined in this scope
[19:29:07] <Eviltwin> tazrover: Don't use onclick
[19:29:41] <tga> why not?
[19:30:04] <Eviltwin> Because it's bad practice
[19:30:09] <tga> great, I see tmpl() is no longer being maintained, but ko.js is still using it as a default
[19:30:27] <coldhead> tmpl is a nightmare
[19:30:31] <coldhead> get out while you still can
[19:30:58] <tga> like I said, it's the Knockout.js default
[19:31:28] <tga> and onclick is not that bad because at least you associate the behaviour right with the element
[19:31:35] <tga> instead of adding it on somewhere else in the code
[19:31:52] <tga> I wouldn't put functionality in there, but calling a function is not that unreasonable
[19:31:53] <_thumper_> Is google.com down for anyone else?
[19:32:10] <Eviltwin> tga: A good design doesn't intermix little bits of languages inside each other
[19:32:25] <Eviltwin> Like JavaScript in attributes of HTML
[19:32:27] <tga> http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/google.com
[19:32:30] <tazrover> Eviltwin:  don't use onclick?  Not sure I follow?
[19:32:41] <tga> tazrover: I think he was talking to me
[19:33:00] <tga> Eviltwin: I know, that's why I said that just calling the right handler in onclick doesn't seem that bad
[19:33:09] <tga> I'm not talking about actual functionality in there
[19:33:21] <tazrover> tga:  gotcha..
[19:33:51] <tga> I'm running this template for all items in an array, and one of my buttons in the template should remove the current element
[19:34:06] <coldhead> onclick puts your javascript in your html where it doesn't belong
[19:34:13] <coldhead> i have broken people's fingers for doing it
[19:34:18] <coldhead> on their favourite hand
[19:34:23] <coldhead> it's not recommended
[19:34:26] <coldhead> sup dr0idsy
[19:35:05] <tga> that's a bit extreme
[19:35:12] <abjorn> so looks like im getting a dev position, coldhead :D
[19:35:29] <tga> absolute or relative?
[19:35:33] <abjorn> the new manager of our dev team is...less than pleased with one of his devs
[19:35:35] <coldhead> lol tga
[19:35:41] <abjorn> and likes my stuff
[19:35:43] <abjorn> also rofl
[19:35:47] <coldhead> abjorn: good luck! you'll be an asset
[19:35:52] <coldhead> asshat
[19:35:53] <coldhead> whatever
[19:35:56] <abjorn> hahah
[19:35:57] <abjorn> both
[19:36:07] <tga> seriously though, how would you pass the current object of a tmpl template to a function?
[19:37:15] <tga> I don't have unique IDs so I'd rather pass the whole object
[19:38:02] <coldhead> tga: http://jsfiddle.net/XzYpB/1/
[19:38:13] <coldhead> if you do something like that, obj will be available in your handler
[19:38:19] <coldhead> and no one gets their fingers broken
[19:39:17] <joshsmith> dr0id: coldhead addressed you, good sir!
[19:39:21] <joshsmith> BOW
[19:39:37] <tga> interesting, so this will cary obj over?
[19:40:06] <coldhead> it will  through the magic of closures
[19:40:12] <dr0id> hehehe, sup colzy and joshy :D
[19:40:19] <coldhead> the stuff in the function () {}s environment survives for you
[19:40:22] <dr0id> nm hee ;)
[19:40:25] <dr0id> here*
[19:41:04] <coldhead> tga: try it and see!
[19:41:04] <tga> cool
[19:44:21] <tazrover> does .sortable() only work with <ul>s ?  Can't seem to get it working with elements inside two <div>s
[19:44:45] <Hornet-> is there a way to prevent massive event queuing without using .stop()
[19:45:16] <Hornet-> more specifically, I have some boxes that when hovered repeatedly (eg the user dicks about with them) the .stop can cause the animation to jam in the wrong position
[19:45:36] <Hornet-> and it seems the later events then cause that to be taken as the destination location
[19:46:03] <frenocha> I think jquery is the reason i'm losing hair :(
[19:46:28] <coldhead> Hornet-: google for hoverintent or ben alman's debounce
[19:46:43] <coldhead> frenocha: unpossible, jquery promotes luxuriant growth
[19:48:09] <coldhead> frenocha: look at some older pictures of john resig -- that glorious mane rubs off onto all jquery devs
[19:48:22] <astropirate> :D
[19:49:17] <Hornet-> http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[19:49:31] <Hornet-> coldhead: if you go nuts sidetoside across the boxes, it still yoyos
[19:49:43] <Hornet-> which is what .stop fixes... but that causes jamming
[19:49:48] <Hornet-> and not the bob marley kind
[19:49:48] <coldhead> man, users who do that are jerks
[19:50:03] <coldhead> what about debounce?
[19:50:10] <Hornet-> looking into that one atm
[19:50:21] <coldhead> i usually just use stop()
[19:50:28] <coldhead> but i tend to assume my users aren't massive jerks
[19:51:09] <Hornet-> http://www.dressedondeck.com/delivery.php if you look at the footer there, you can see what happens with .stop
[19:51:19] <Hornet-> it sort of gives up trying to fall down properly
[19:51:30] <Hornet-> and I really can't see a sane solution that solves both problems
[19:51:59] <Hornet-> can't load the pages that have the debounce demos :\
[19:52:01] <Hornet-> unhelpful
[19:52:15] <tga> shouldn't .on() be in 1.7+?
[19:52:22] <frenocha> coldhead: :)
[19:52:25] * tga investigates why .on is not defined
[19:53:09] <frenocha> coldhead: but whatever did happen to that mane of his? QED?
[19:55:19] <coldhead> i think he keeps it in a box and let's women stroke it by candlelight
[19:55:25] <coldhead> special women
[19:55:27] <coldhead> women like me
[19:55:40] <coldhead> ANYWAY may we assist you in some wise frenocha ?
[19:56:06] <frenocha> women who spent their time proclaiming their jquery-induced baldnesses through their irc nicknames
[19:56:08] <coldhead> oh fuck, sorry hornet, ben's site is down and he's on a cruise
[19:56:11] <coldhead> i fogot
[19:56:28] <coldhead> I HAVE A RICH AND FULL HEAD OF HAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH
[19:56:34] <tga> alright, slightly better question, does .on() work on future elements?
[19:56:37] <frenocha> i'm all good, thanks :) just hanging out so I have people to yell at when jquery makes me cry internally
[19:56:38] <coldhead> it's been favourably called "a thatch"
[19:56:44] <coldhead> good work
[19:56:55] <coldhead> tga: yes, that's its purpose
[19:57:01] <frenocha> tga: that's the idea
[19:57:11] <tga> that's what I tought, but it doesn't do that for me
[19:57:13] <tga> *thought
[19:57:28] <frenocha> when I was asking about .on() yesterday, I was still using bind() - true story!
[19:57:29] <coldhead> ur doon it wrung
[19:57:31] * tga wonders whether it has something to do with knockout and tmpl
[19:57:53] <frenocha> i'm now officially .bind()-free, though... in my own scripts
[19:58:16] <frenocha> didn't feel like going through fancybox's code just out of principle just yet
[20:00:08] <Hornet-> coldhead: I'm using http://code.google.com/p/jquery-debounce/ - however it loses the event object
[20:00:12] <Hornet-> or mongles it somehow
[20:00:18] <Hornet-> how do I preserve that? :\
[20:00:26] <dr0id> codemirror or ace ?
[20:00:33] <Hornet-> $('#footer-widget a').hover($.debounce(function(e) { is the invoker
[20:00:50] <Hornet-> before debounce that was $('#footer-widget a').hover(function(e) {
[20:01:09] <Hornet-> very close though, just can't quite get it there
[20:02:51] <coldhead> i'm not sure sorry Hornet-
[20:02:59] <Hornet-> hrm, k :\
[20:03:01] <Hornet-> thanks anyway
[20:03:03] <coldhead> i'd have you ask ben_alman but he's on a boat -_-
[20:03:31] <clu3> is there a unique hash for each DOM element somehow?
[20:03:35] <joshsmith> tga: how is not working for you?
[20:03:54] <joshsmith> *is it
[20:04:33] <coldhead> no clu3
[20:05:05] <joshsmith> wait, does that mean no clue, clu3
[20:05:11] <joshsmith> or no, clu3
[20:05:12] <clu3> k thanks coldhead
[20:05:14] <clu3> haha
[20:05:39] <tga> joshsmith: I am using .on() to catch buttons created live by knockout with tmpl
[20:05:42] <joshsmith> The Case of the Potentially Missing Punctuation
[20:05:50] <clu3> joshsmith, i'm clu3less
[20:05:52] <frenocha> between php, mysql, js, html, mysql and css the last always seems to be the loser with me
[20:05:56] <tga> joshsmith: newly created buttons don't get the event binding
[20:06:00] <frenocha> I said mysql twice, that's how important it is!
[20:06:03] <joshsmith> tga: for some reason .on didn't work as .live would've for me, either
[20:06:33] <tga> my money is on ko.js and/or tmpl screwing things up
[20:07:18] <joshsmith> tga: can you show me what your .on code looks like?
[20:07:22] <joshsmith> gist/hastie/pastie
[20:07:45] <Hornet-> coldhead: alman's site is down atm, is that related? :P
[20:07:48] <tga> it's hard to get it all in a paste
[20:07:59] <joshsmith> tga: just show me the .on itself
[20:08:06] <tga> joshsmith: knockout applies a tmpl template for each item of an array
[20:08:19] <tga> $(".remove_filter_button").on("click", function() { console.log("delete clicked"); })
[20:09:00] <tga> I have two .remove_filter_buttons, but the ones created dynamically don't get the handler
[20:09:06] <joshsmith> tga: try $('body').on('click', '.remove_filter_button', function() {});
[20:09:15] <Hornet-> restating question then, can anybody advise on a solution that'll stop the mad bouncing seen when swiping across the footer rapidly? http://www.dressedondeck.com/delivery.php
[20:09:46] <Hornet-> debounce/throttle has no accessible documentation, so I can't see if/how I can keep my events working
[20:09:49] <tga> joshsmith: works
[20:09:52] <tga> interesting
[20:10:19] <joshsmith> tga: see this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8410583/cant-listen-on-events-within-the-jquery-ui-autocomplete-menu
[20:10:43] <coldhead> yes Hornet-, that's very related
[20:11:08] <Hornet-> ah, I see
[20:11:14] <Hornet-> helpful :(
[20:11:25] <tga> joshsmith: cool, thanks
[20:11:41] <tga> it kinda makes sense, since you need to attach the event to something
[20:11:49] <dr0id> codemirror or ace ?
[20:12:02] <joshsmith> tga: yeah, I just expected .on to work the same way .live did
[20:12:06] <coldhead> i don't understand the question, dr0id
[20:12:07] <joshsmith> so I was confused
[20:12:18] <dr0id> which one you guys prefer ?
[20:12:25] <coldhead> i have never heard of either
[20:12:26] <tga> this will probably save me a lot of headaches down the road
[20:12:30] <dr0id> nvm then :P
[20:12:55] <joshsmith> dr0id: googling codemirror gives me "codemirror vs ace" as first autocomplete
[20:13:09] <frenocha> what's a codemirror? ace is a data compression format for me :(
[20:13:12] <joshsmith> tga: yeah, I am bound to foget, though
[20:13:17] <dr0id> ofc I googled that, not much good info found
[20:13:20] <coldhead> oh, ace does cloud9
[20:13:20] <coldhead>  
[20:13:23] <coldhead> people love that
[20:13:55] <frenocha> coldhead: but Sandeep Shetty says CodeMirror has better support for textareas!
[20:14:09] <dr0id> I read that too, heh :P
[20:14:18] <zackattack> I have a 3-layer list.  How can I select only the <li> of the second level in order to apply a style?  $("ul#top-level > li").children().addClass('hilite') also adds a hilite to the grandchildren...
[20:14:20] * tga is starting to hate knockoutjs
[20:14:37] <tga> wonderful library, one tiny error and it does absolutely nothing, not even an error
[20:15:19] <Hornet> coldhead: thanks, managed to sort it with hoverintent + no stop
[20:15:27] <Hornet> and a slightly rejigged function
[20:15:40] <coldhead> good work Hornet!
[20:15:46] <Hornet> debounce/throttle looks handy though
[20:15:48] <joshsmith> tga: have you read that building large javascript applications book?
[20:15:59] <tga> nope
[20:16:03] <Hornet> just a pain I can't access the resources for it
[20:16:08] <tga> which one?
[20:16:13] <joshsmith> you might want to get a better overview of your options
[20:16:32] <Hornet> Raising Javascript for Fun and Profit
[20:16:44] <coldhead> benalman.com will be back asap
[20:16:51] <coldhead> i've never known it to go down before :(
[20:17:01] <coldhead> he'll be very upset
[20:17:11] <joshsmith> tga: http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Web-Applications-Alex-MacCaw/dp/144930351X
[20:17:23] <zackattack> Anyone?
[20:17:31] <zackattack> How can I apply a class to a <td> but not to its descendants?
[20:17:35] <joshsmith> Bueller...Bueller...?
[20:18:13] <Hornet> select it properly, zackattack?
[20:18:21] <Hornet> sounds like you're misunderstanding somethng
[20:18:25] <zackattack> probably.
[20:18:26] <Hornet> or misstating your question
[20:18:29] <joshsmith> tga: this is what I spent my day on: http://wadsup.nodejitsu.com/cities/hello :/
[20:19:09] <tga> node, I see
[20:19:14] <Prot> Question: if you remove/replace something from the dom, how do you ensure the nodes are gone from memory? I'm trying to prevent leaks
[20:19:41] <zackattack> Hornet:  So, I have this list called "selected-plays".  It has 3 sublists, comedy, drama & tragedy.  each of those contain plays.  inside all of those, i want to highlight the play names, which are <li>s.  but one of the <li>s also contains a <ul>, and i don't want to hilite those. ...
[20:20:07] <zackattack>   $('ul#selected-plays > li > ul > li')  will select all the <lis>, but when i apply a .addClass('blah') transformation, it also applies the class to the children of the lis
[20:20:15] <joshsmith> tga: indeed
[20:20:40] <joshsmith> that's a worldwide city autocomplete API
[20:20:46] <tga> nice
[20:21:00] <joshsmith> fucking waste of my time
[20:21:13] <joshsmith> took way too long to build
[20:21:14] <zackattack> Hornet, does that make sense?
[20:21:26] <joshsmith> but go here http://wadsup.nodejitsu.com/home
[20:21:33] <joshsmith> click in that place input, and change the location
[20:21:39] <Hornet> zackattack: what elements are the children of the li?
[20:21:40] <joshsmith> works nicely enough, I guess
[20:21:48] <yamahaalex37> why does clicking once on my jquery draggable handle expand the div to 100% 100%
[20:21:50] <yamahaalex37> http://eternaware.com/index.php/downloads/item/1-content-rotate
[20:21:57] <Hornet> unless they are li's as well for some reason they shouldn't get the class too
[20:22:08] <joshsmith> oh, ofc it's going slow as shit now
[20:22:39] <zackattack> Hornet:  http://pastie.org/2989390  --- i want to hilite all of the play titles, *except* "part I" and "part II"
[20:24:19] <Hornet> I'd check your css
[20:24:30] <Hornet> are you sure the actual class is added to the final li elements?
[20:24:32] <zackattack> what do you mean?
[20:24:34] <zackattack> yeah.
[20:24:44] <Hornet> well, can't see why then
[20:24:48] <Hornet> all looks okay to me
[20:25:00] <Hornet> bearin mind it is 4:30am here
[20:25:26] <Hornet> try adding a class to the sub-layer ul's for clarity
[20:25:35] <Hornet> will help debug if nothing else
[20:26:37] <zackattack> Hornet: ooh, good suggestion!  well, it's not over-riding.
[20:27:51] <zackattack> but by default, the children are inheriting the class..
[20:28:59] * zackattack slaps forehead
[20:33:07] <Hornet> sorted it zackattack?
[20:33:12] <zackattack> yea, i think so.
[20:33:19] <zackattack> thanks :)
[20:34:35] <Spadeski> Sup errbody
[20:41:36] <hobs> hine
[20:42:17] <Spadeski> Sup
[20:42:51] <chee> check out this guy:  á›
[20:44:43] <Spadeski> whats some good apps that attract people on homepage of a site?
[20:45:18] <chee> Spadeski: one that generates thousands of unicode umbrellas in different colours
[20:45:27] <chee> that would attract me, at least
[20:49:20] <coldhead> lol chee
[20:49:37] <tga> I just hate it when I try to reproduce a bug in jsfiddle and everything works
[20:49:42] <coldhead> also magnets, shiny things, newstickers, stock quotes, nudity and flames (to attract moths)
[20:50:03] <coldhead> that's awesome, tga, because it means you broke it
[20:50:19] <coldhead> and you don't have to wait for some bozo to fix your ticket
[20:50:39] <hobs> bozo the clown
[20:50:50] <hobs> is working on your javascript library
[20:50:50] <tga> damn library just stops doing anything when I add a certain binding
[20:50:57] * tga took the effort to create a nice test case
[20:52:04] <coldhead> it's all part of the process
[20:52:15] <coldhead> you're a better person for it
[20:52:50] <zackattack> if I have a bunch of <li>s on a page, and I call   $("li:eq(1)").nextAll()  -- should the nextAll() method work ?
[20:53:10] <zackattack> i'm getting an error.  TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'nextAll'
[20:53:40] <chee> i think you mean $('li').eq(1)
[20:53:47] <chee> don't you
[20:53:51] <chee> doesn't he
[20:53:53] <Eviltwin> chee: They accomplish the same thing
[20:54:00] <Eviltwin> But yours is actually faster
[20:54:01] <chee> do they!
[20:54:27] <Eviltwin> zackattack: Are you doing exactly that?
[20:54:32] <zackattack> Yes.
[20:54:33] <Eviltwin> Can you reproduce in jsFiddle?
[20:54:48] <zackattack> Good idea
[20:56:12] <zackattack> It works in jsFiddle..
[20:56:39] <zackattack> Wow, for some reason I've been using jquery 1.1.
[20:56:41] * zackattack forehead slap
[20:56:47] <Eviltwin> WHAT THE FUCK?
[20:56:49] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[20:56:55] <Eviltwin> But that's really ancient
[20:57:00] <zackattack> I know!
[20:58:26] <zackattack> I accidentally downloaded the code for the 1st edition of my book
[20:59:23] <Eviltwin> ?
[21:01:20] <zackattack> i'm studying "learning jquery, 3rd edition" and i downloaded the code samples for "learning jquery, 1st edition", and they were based off jquery 1.1
[21:01:24] <zackattack> 3rd edition is based off 1.6.2
[21:07:15] <tga> mmkay, this stuff is getting on my nerves
[21:07:31] <tga> if you had to build a simple one-page app with dynamic filters on top
[21:07:44] <tga> the kind that you click + and get a new filter line, and then apply it all to the data in DOM
[21:07:49] <tga> what library would you use?
[21:08:02] <tga> would you use a view model or just work with the DOM directly?
[21:08:54] <Cork> tga: i would clone one of the empty filters when the page loads
[21:09:14] <Cork> tga: then just clone that copy and insert it into the list each time anyone click the +
[21:09:41] <tga> right, so working with the DOM, no templates
[21:09:47] <Eviltwin> What?
[21:09:55] <Cork> why templates?
[21:09:59] <Cork> you already have it
[21:10:19] <Eviltwin> JavaScript is designed to operate on an element tree (the DOM), not HTML
[21:10:44] <tga> right, but then when you want to read the filters you have to look at the DOM
[21:10:56] <Cork> tga: ofcource!
[21:10:59] <Cork> where else?
[21:11:07] <tga> moreover, to filter items, you have to go compare their html to the filter text
[21:11:16] <Cork> uh...
[21:11:21] <Cork> no
[21:11:32] <Cork> ?serializeArray @ tga
[21:11:33] <bot-t> tga, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[21:11:50] <tga> yeah, but that's form elements
[21:11:58] <tga> not table rows
[21:12:01] <Cork> your not using input fiels?
[21:12:08] <tga> it's not particularly pretty
[21:12:14] <Cork> /select elements
[21:12:21] <tga> the items can have complex visualization
[21:12:36] <Cork> tga: what are you storing the info in then?
[21:13:01] <tga> MVC would say keeping a model of the items and then generating a view from that
[21:13:34] <tga> maybe I'll give Backbone.js a try, it seems to be all about that
[21:13:39] <Cork> but that means dubble storing the data, at least
[21:13:46] <Cork> often even tripple store
[21:13:58] <tga> just double, yeah
[21:14:11] <Cork> why overcomplicate it??
[21:14:13] <tga> but it saves you from searching for it in random divs
[21:14:18] <Cork> O_o'
[21:14:31] <Spadeski> Can someone help me setup the HTML for this jquery sorry new to the whole list thing http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6507926/simple-news-ticker-how-to-make-autoscroll-auto-action-performe-with-jquery
[21:14:38] <tga> + I can change the item template without worrying about filtering code
[21:14:44] <Cork> tga: sounds more like what you have to create your filters is missing vital parts
[21:15:50] <tga> umm?
[21:16:34] <yamahaalex37> why is min-width working but not min-height
[21:16:38] <yamahaalex37> this is with jqueryUI resizable
[21:16:39] <yamahaalex37> http://eternaware.com/index.php/downloads/item/1-content-rotate
[21:19:23] <yamahaalex37> nvm
[21:22:02] <tga> if you were adding tags to things, so one name div and one input
[21:22:18] <tga> how many records would you stuff in the DOM?
[21:22:29] <tga> before it would get too much for regular browsers to handle
[21:22:55] <tga> 10k? 50k? 100k?
[21:23:31] <Cork> never really had any problems except with really long tables
[21:23:46] <Cork> say 10000 lines
[21:24:00] <Cork> and that would be *4-7 to 40000-70000
[21:24:11] <Cork> to==so
[21:24:52] <tga> alright, so 10k should be fine, 100k is too much
[21:25:08] <Cork> 100 doesn't have to be
[21:25:22] <Cork> it depends more on what type of elements your adding then how many
[21:25:40] <Cork> tables is about the most expensive you can use in a browser
[21:34:11] <arena_> Hello all. Anyone have experience with jEditable and tinyMCE?
[21:34:56] <panfist> so i've been using jquery on my pages for quite some time and have a decent understanding of the philosophy, but now i'd like to write something a little more re-usable than a one-off thing for a particular page.
[21:35:34] <panfist> the idea is to have a list of <a> elements somewhere, registered to a div or other block element and use jQuery.get() to load the responses of those links into the target div,
[21:36:05] <Eviltwin> panfist: Read this through: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[21:36:20] <Eviltwin> It starts with the basics (small stuff) and works through the more powerful and flexible designs
[21:36:37] <panfist> when a link is clicked it hides the current contents of the target div, so that if the same link is clicked again, it just shows the previously hidden div
[21:36:40] <panfist> thanks
[21:36:47] <panfist> that looks perfect
[21:36:51] <arena_> Can someone help me with this file: http://www.pastie.org/2989563? Having issues initializing jEditable
[21:37:25] <Eviltwin> If it's widget-oriented (some UI-specific controls etc.), after reading that page, look at the jQuery UI widget API
[21:37:31] <Eviltwin> But definitely read that page first
[21:38:26] <panfist> ok
[21:38:45] <sasori> how to fetch the id of an <a> ? , let's say i have lots of rows and each <a> tag has a unique ID..if I click the 1st one, I should get its ID .....( to be used in ajax later )
[21:39:02] <Eviltwin> sasori: .attr("id")
[21:39:35] <sasori> ok thanks Eviltwin  :D
[21:40:08] <panfist> apparently i should just look at jquery ui page because jquery ui > tabs > content via ajax is exactly what i was going to do
[21:40:34] <arena_> Can someone help me with http://www.pastie.org/2989571? Wondering why line 27 messes up jEditable
[21:41:51] <panfist> although...on the demo page for tabs/content via ajax, it says the tab label switches to 'loading...' when it's waiting for content to come in... i didn't see that in chrome or firefxo
[21:44:51] <Eviltwin> panfist: I would still start by reading the Plugin Authoring page for jQuery
[21:44:55] <Eviltwin> It'll give you more context
[21:45:57] <panfist> yeah, i'm chewing on it now. maybe i won't re-implement this widget as my next project, but it's time to level-up my javascript
[21:52:35] <abstrakt> is there a tool for replicating sets of fields?
[21:52:40] <abstrakt> input fields that is
[21:52:48] <Eviltwin> What?
[21:53:16] <Cork> abstrakt: .clone() ?
[21:53:22] <Cork> ?.clone @ abstrakt
[21:53:22] <bot-t> abstrakt, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[21:53:36] <abstrakt> like if I have <input name="cart[items][0][title]" value="Computer"/>, and I also have <input name="cart[items][1][title]
[21:53:39] <abstrakt> for example
[21:53:52] <abstrakt> but in addition to title I also have i.e. description and price for each one
[21:54:20] <abstrakt> how can I replicate that field set, and call it cart[items][2]...
[21:54:35] <Eviltwin> What you have is a very specific use case
[21:54:38] <abstrakt> is there a way to automate this? i mean I know how I could take steps to do this manually, but it seems like there's gotta be something that can automate this
[21:54:39] <Eviltwin> jQuery is more abstract than that
[21:54:42] <abstrakt> i just don't know what it would be called
[21:54:54] <Cork> abstrakt: select the elements of even simpler, there parent
[21:54:55] <abstrakt> right, but I'm saying, plugins maybe
[21:54:57] <Eviltwin> You can duplicate elements (essentially) using clones
[21:54:57] <abstrakt> what would you call this
[21:55:00] <Eviltwin> clone()
[21:55:07] <Cork> abstrakt: then select the inputs by name and change them
[21:55:08] <abstrakt> i actually don't think it's that specific, I think it's quite a common desire
[21:55:37] <Eviltwin> cart[items][0][title], cart[items][0][description] -> cart[items][1][title], cart[items][0][description]
[21:55:50] <Eviltwin> It's kind of specific since your not duplicating an incrementing a leaf
[21:56:18] <abstrakt> anyway, does it have a name?
[21:56:18] <Eviltwin> regexes are probably going to be your friend for this one
[21:56:37] <abstrakt> yeh I'm fine with regex, i was just wondering if anyone knew of anything pre-built to do this
[21:56:42] <abstrakt> you know, not reinventing the wheel and all
[21:56:55] <Eviltwin> A name for duplicating and incrementing the grandchild of a form data structure?
[21:57:02] <Eviltwin> No, don't think there's a name for it
[21:57:23] <Eviltwin> You could search more generic
[21:57:28] <Eviltwin> And see if someone has something close
[21:57:29] <Anime> http://jsfiddle.net/rkrkh/2/ - anyone have any idea on why the img src is not being set, please?
[21:57:32] <Eviltwin> I suggest "form manipulations"
[21:57:43] <Eviltwin> With "jQuery" mixed in there somewhere
[21:57:57] <Cork> abstrakt: does these input have a common parent you can grab them all by?
[21:58:11] <Eviltwin> Anime: First off, jsFiddle is set to MooTools there, not jQuery
[21:58:21] <Anime> ouch.
[21:58:33] <Eviltwin> Cork: I think his difficulty is in incrementing those numbers
[21:58:45] <Cork> Eviltwin: its not
[21:58:49] <Cork> thats simple
[21:59:51] <Eviltwin> Then write him a solution
[22:00:07] <Cork> i need the details first
[22:00:09] <Anime> didn't work with jquery either..
[22:02:29] <Eviltwin> Anime: Do you have Firebug?
[22:02:35] <Eviltwin> Or something similar?
[22:02:50] <Anime> i do
[22:03:08] <Eviltwin> So you don't see the syntax error in the jsFiddle?
[22:03:42] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/rkrkh/4/
[22:04:05] <Anime> i don't really know how to use firebug well, just to mess with some css or so.. :/
[22:04:34] <Anime> oh shit, the );
[22:05:26] <Anime> right, this brings it to another prob, when its fading in, it gets on top of the whats-supposed-to-be-the-frame, is there a way to keep it always below it?
[22:06:46] <Eviltwin> Anime: A z-index
[22:07:16] <lyrae> var $this = $(this),   why the , after ) ?
[22:07:34] <Eviltwin> lyrae: Because it's declaring a list of vars?
[22:07:44] <Anime> thanks twin :)
[22:07:51] <lyrae> cant yo do that without ,
[22:08:40] <Cork> lyrae: the variable declarations continue on the next line
[22:08:53] <Cork> var var1, var2, var3, var4;
[22:09:04] <lyrae> right
[22:09:15] <Eviltwin> lyrae: http://jsfiddle.net/5W8TC/
[22:09:20] <lyrae> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring its actually code from the last bit of code in this page
[22:09:29] <yamahaalex37> can i post entire style sheet code in jquery
[22:09:39] <yamahaalex37> instead of .css('item', 'value'
[22:09:46] <lyrae> ahhh Eviltwin thanks. that helped
[22:09:48] <yamahaalex37> do .style("cooooode")
[22:10:08] <Cork> abstrakt?
[22:10:12] <Eviltwin> lyrae: Those first two things mean exactly the same thing
[22:10:29] <lyrae> yep
[22:10:41] <arena_> Hello all. Can someone help me out here? Trying to get jEditable and tinyMCE to work. My page: http://jsfiddle.net/mrc3C/1/
[22:11:03] <yamahaalex37> instead of .css('item', 'value'); can i do .style("item{foo: bar;} etc")
[22:11:09] <arena_> Been having issues for over a week, working from code that I found on waybackmachine... Could really use a hand o.o
[22:11:49] <Cork> yamahaalex37: style isn't a jquery function
[22:12:12] <Cork> yamahaalex37: its a dom object, collection
[22:12:37] <Cork> elm.style.color or elm.style.backgroundColor and so on
[22:12:51] <yamahaalex37> so i cant do a large amount in one ""
[22:12:52] <yamahaalex37> ?
[22:12:58] <Cork> sure you can
[22:13:24] <Cork> css({ 'color':'red', 'margin-left': '10px'});
[22:13:26] <yamahaalex37> how would i do a couple of {foo: bar; foo:bar; etc_
[22:13:28] <yamahaalex37> oh ok
[22:13:39] <yamahaalex37> really? with :
[22:13:40] <yamahaalex37> im used to ,
[22:13:49] <Cork> thats arrays
[22:13:57] <Cork> [1,2,3,4,5,6]
[22:14:05] <yamahaalex37> $('#winMainContent').css('top', '32px');
[22:14:09] <Cork> obejcts are {key:value, key:value}
[22:14:17] <Cork> and thats attributes
[22:14:32] <Cork> two attributes, i sent one objects as one attribute
[22:14:47] <Cork> (notice the {} around them)
[22:15:06] <yamahaalex37> ok
[22:15:16] <yamahaalex37> why doesnt this work
[22:15:17] <yamahaalex37> $('#winMainContent').css({ 'width':'100%', 'top': '32px', 'bottom': '0px'});
[22:15:38] <Cork> that should work
[22:15:39] <yamahaalex37> check it out
[22:15:43] <yamahaalex37> notice the blue margin on bottom?
[22:15:44] <yamahaalex37> http://eternaware.com/index.php/downloads/item/1-content-rotate
[22:16:02] <yamahaalex37> if you resize the div (very bottom right corner, green resize icon)
[22:16:19] <yamahaalex37> then click the blue magnify icon on the div titlebar
[22:16:31] <yamahaalex37> that should set the same code i have originally in the css
[22:16:47] <yamahaalex37> but it does not move it to the bottom
[22:17:25] <yamahaalex37> is that a jquery UI bug?
[22:17:36] <Cork> yamahaalex37: you have elements before it, and parents around it with unspecified height's
[22:17:40] <Cork> 100% is ignored then
[22:17:56] <Cork> (by the browser)
[22:18:06] <yamahaalex37> im not setting it to 100%
[22:18:11] <yamahaalex37> im just settting its bottom: 32px;
[22:18:16] <yamahaalex37> like is originally in the css
[22:18:31] <yamahaalex37> excuse me, bottom: 0px;
[22:19:23] <Cork> yamahaalex37: wheres the code
[22:19:47] <yamahaalex37> here
[22:19:47] <yamahaalex37> http://www.webdevout.net/test?01M
[22:19:57] <yamahaalex37> i only compare the css and jquery, for simplcity
[22:20:15] <Cork> yamahaalex37: use a pb where you can have live code
[22:20:21] <Cork> ?p @ yamahaalex37
[22:20:21] <bot-t> yamahaalex37, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:21:20] <yamahaalex37> ok here i put the html, jquery and css
[22:21:25] <yamahaalex37> but only the pertinent stuff
[22:21:25] <yamahaalex37> http://www.webdevout.net/test?021
[22:21:38] <yamahaalex37> huh, jfiddle? whats the difference? it wont work anyway, its not the whole site
[22:22:02] <Cork> sigh
[22:22:11] <Cork> yamahaalex37: you need to have the framework for the code to work
[22:22:25] <Cork> webdevout doen't provide that
[22:22:55] <yamahaalex37> ok but that still wont work
[22:22:55] <yamahaalex37> http://jsfiddle.net/VTS5F/
[22:23:13] <yamahaalex37> unless you want the whole page
[22:24:11] <yamahaalex37> Cork, was that what you need?
[22:24:52] <Cork> yamahaalex37: wfm http://jsfiddle.net/VTS5F/1/
[22:26:13] <arena_> Guys quick quesiton. I have two jquery statements affecting the same element. Is there any reason why $('#foo').one() followed by $('#foo').two() should not work? They work individually
[22:27:18] <yamahaalex37> Cork, i dont get it?
[22:27:24] <yamahaalex37> what am i supposed to see
[22:27:36] <Cork> yamahaalex37: the css is changed for me at least
[22:27:45] <joshsmith> man I love jQuery UI autocomplet
[22:27:46] <joshsmith> e
[22:27:48] <Cork> #main is the full height of the window
[22:28:04] <Cork> and #mainContents is to the bottom
[22:28:12] <Cork> (its transparent though)
[22:28:16] <yamahaalex37> Corey, did you do something different?
[22:28:18] <yamahaalex37> Cork
[22:28:33] <Cork> yamahaalex37: i removed the click event for the element that didn't exist
[22:28:47] <Cork> and selected jquery as framework, and added the code in header
[22:28:49] <Cork> nothing else
[22:28:54] <yamahaalex37> btnMinisize exists...
[22:29:03] <yamahaalex37>     <li id="btnMinisize"></li>
[22:29:09] <yamahaalex37> its kind of needed to toggle this event...
[22:29:21] <Cork> ok so its a 0 size element
[22:29:25] <Cork> kinda hard to click that
[22:29:30] <yamahaalex37> because there is an image
[22:29:32] <yamahaalex37> on the real site
[22:29:41] <Cork> yamahaalex37: the point is, the css commands works
[22:30:03] <Cork> what i changed was just things that made it easier to show in the pb
[22:30:11] <yamahaalex37> right. and there is ablue margin on the bottom. but when you jqueryUI resize the div, then click, the css does not return to how it was
[22:30:15] <Cork> i didn't even touch the code you asked about
[22:30:20] <joshsmith> do y'all realize you can use images in jQuery UI autocomplete's dropdown?
[22:30:22] <yamahaalex37> although *i think* im setting everything correct how it was in that jquery command
[22:30:30] <yamahaalex37>     $('#winMainContent').css({ 'width':'100%', 'top': '32px', 'bottom': '0px'});
[22:31:32] <Cork> yamahaalex37: 	
[22:31:32] <Cork> $('#winMainContent').css({''});
[22:31:36] <Cork> might have to do with it
[22:31:43] <Cork> your code is broken
[22:31:54] <Cork> and the event even executes
[22:31:55] <yamahaalex37> thats just what i tried the last 5 seconds to try reverting css to default
[22:32:07] <yamahaalex37> so you are looking at the real site now not the pastebin?
[22:32:13] <Cork> you can't reset css like that
[22:32:27] <Cork> yamahaalex37: the pb is kinda pointless, the code in there works
[22:32:49] <yamahaalex37> Cork, i dont even see anywhere to resize the div in pb
[22:33:25] <Cork> yamahaalex37: if you want to add/remove css rules, use classes,
[22:33:39] <Cork> then add the class when you want it, then remove the class when you don't
[22:33:54] <Cork> adding it inline will make it harder to get it to work
[22:34:09] <yamahaalex37> but your right, the pb is pointless, its better to just see the problem on the site, then compare these 2 snips of relevant code
[22:34:10] <yamahaalex37> http://jsfiddle.net/VTS5F/2/
[22:34:38] <Cork> yamahaalex37: its meaning full with a pb if you replicate the problem, you didn't
[22:34:55] <yamahaalex37> i know, there is too much local stuff, im sorry
[22:35:10] <Cork> yamahaalex37: the code your looking at isn't the problem
[22:35:14] <yamahaalex37> oh
[22:35:24] <yamahaalex37> which code is problem?
[22:35:41] <yamahaalex37> because the CSS code i listed does correctly apply the 32 margin on the bottom
[22:36:07] <nawtnow> Anyone have a clue on what direction jQuery UI will take for templating?
[22:36:12] <Cork> $('#main').css('bottom', '0px')
[22:36:50] <coldhead> nawtnow: they will be doing a deluxe and awesome templater that will be released a few years after the apocalypse
[22:37:01] <coldhead> don't hold your breath
[22:37:13] <nawtnow> coldhead, lol, I know, it's been forever! Since like what, 1.4?
[22:37:16] <coldhead> i mean, it's only a year away but that's a long time to hold your breath
[22:37:33] <yamahaalex37> Cork, you want me to add that in the click handle?
[22:37:38] <coldhead> i think they've been sidetracked by someone deleting the entire jquery plugins database
[22:37:46] <Cork> yamahaalex37: or just remove the 32px bottom from your css
[22:37:49] <yamahaalex37> that would just kill the margin that is set by main: bottom 32px
[22:37:57] <yamahaalex37> but i want that 32px margin
[22:38:00] <Cork> exactly
[22:38:12] <Cork> but thats what creates the margin you want to remove
[22:38:24] <yamahaalex37> i dont want to remove the margin
[22:38:26] <nawtnow> coldhead, oh crap, I didn't even know about that
[22:38:33] <nawtnow> You mean this, http://blog.jquery.com/2011/12/08/what-is-happening-to-the-jquery-plugins-site/?
[22:38:48] <yamahaalex37> myt question is why winMainContent doesnt obey the 32px margin, rather it goes past it, even though i set the same code in jquery handle that is in the css
[22:39:05] <Cork> uh... it doe...
[22:39:07] <Cork> 'does
[22:39:16] <yamahaalex37> it does go past it?
[22:39:22] <yamahaalex37> ok im sorry, ill explain better
[22:39:32] <yamahaalex37> when you load the site, you see a 32 px margin on the bottom
[22:39:38] <Cork> ya
[22:39:42] <yamahaalex37> when you resize the div, then expand it with the blue icon, you lose the 32px margin
[22:39:50] <yamahaalex37> http://eternaware.com/index.php/downloads/item/1-content-rotate
[22:39:54] <yamahaalex37> see the bottom 32px blue margin?
[22:40:08] <yamahaalex37> i still want it there after clicking the blue magnify icon
[22:40:40] <Cork> yamahaalex37: <div id="main" style="bottom: 0px;">
[22:40:51] <Cork> it obays what the #main tells it to do
[22:41:18] <yamahaalex37> Cork, why would i set that to 0px, when i want a 32px margin?
[22:42:04] <Cork> yamahaalex37: it was a missunderstanding of what you wanted
[22:42:12] <yamahaalex37> im sorry
[22:42:25] <Cork> yamahaalex37: but it all comes down to what the css for #main says
[22:42:47] <Cork> winMain and winMainContent works as they are suppose to
[22:42:51] <Cork> thats my point
[22:43:38] <yamahaalex37> Cork, they work like they are supposed to when the page loads
[22:43:47] <yamahaalex37> when i resize the div, then expand it, it doesnt revert to how it was
[22:44:02] <Cork> yamahaalex37: did you remove the line that removes the bottom: 32px on #main?
[22:44:03] <yamahaalex37> which is why im confused, because *i think* my jquery statement matches the css which was there previous to resizing
[22:44:16] <yamahaalex37> no its stil there
[22:44:32] <yamahaalex37> wait wait, sorry taht statement confused me
[22:44:40] <yamahaalex37> the line to create a 32px bottom margin is there.
[22:45:33] <Cork> ah
[22:45:39] <Cork> now i see what your after
[22:45:45] <Cork> you can't use 100% height
[22:46:07] <Cork> that will do similar to self.height(self.parent().height());
[22:46:15] <Cork> it doesn't check its siblings sizes
[22:46:38] <yamahaalex37> cant use 100% height on what
[22:46:40] <yamahaalex37> ill remove it from everythign
[22:46:46] <Cork> winMainContent
[22:46:57] <Cork> it will be winMainTop to height
[22:47:09] <Cork> *too height
[22:47:21] <Cork> bah.. *heigh
[22:47:46] <Cork> man... my spelling sucks big time to day >_<

[22:48:52] <yamahaalex37> Cork there is no height 100 on winMainContent
[22:49:11] <qawsedrf> hi, need some help. $('iframe').contents().find('body').append('<script>alert('loaded');</script>'); will not append the script tags to the iframe's body, why so ?
[22:49:16] <Cork> yamahaalex37: its added by code
[22:49:21] <qawsedrf> replace that script code with something like 'abcde' and that will work
[22:49:22] <Cork> yamahaalex37: its inline css
[22:49:58] <yamahaalex37> your right it was added with jquery
[22:50:00] <yamahaalex37> i removed that
[22:50:24] <arena_> Hi all, is anyone available to help?
[22:50:38] <yamahaalex37> arena_, read the sign
[22:50:51] <yamahaalex37> *Sign: #CSS - Be Back In 5*
[22:50:52] <qawsedrf> anyone ?>
[22:51:18] <yamahaalex37> Cork, i removed height 100%, but now see its odd it doesnt touch bottom still
[22:51:30] <yamahaalex37> #winMain, which is green, does go to the 32px margin
[22:51:34] <arena_> Gotcha. Need help with this, it seems that jQuery statements are conflicting: http://jsfiddle.net/mrc3C/7/
[22:51:56] <yamahaalex37> but for some reason bottom: 0px doesnt work for #winMainContent, like it does originally with CSS
[22:52:14] <Cork> yamahaalex37: you need to reset the height $('#winMainContent').css('height', '')
[22:53:02] <yamahaalex37> HOLY SHIT CORK
[22:53:07] <yamahaalex37> what is your address im going to come kiss you
[22:53:07] <Cork> yamahaalex37: if you'r not using a dom inspector i would strongly recomend it
[22:53:09] <yamahaalex37> no homo
[22:53:18] <yamahaalex37> i am, i just didnt catch that
[22:53:49] <Cork> just simple css rules
[22:54:02] <yamahaalex37> Cork, any1 else would have been frustrated and rude after that long
[22:54:07] <yamahaalex37> i cant thank you enough
[22:54:12] <Cork> np
[22:56:11] <arena_> I need help with jquery. I can't get tinyMCE and jEditable to play nice with each other: http://jsfiddle.net/mrc3C/8/
[22:58:06] <qawsedrf> WOW
[22:58:10] <qawsedrf> works with appendChild
[22:58:16] <qawsedrf> i think jquery's append is borked or smth :P
[22:58:50] <Cork> qawsedrf: no its not
[22:58:59] <Cork> you can work with jquery cross documents like that
[22:59:06] <Cork> you need to do it in another way
[23:00:16] <Cork> qawsedrf: $('body', $('iframe')[0].document).append('<script>alert('loaded');</script>');
[23:00:40] <Cork> qawsedrf: you need to pass jquery what document it should be working on
[23:02:26] <arena_> Cork would you mind braving my issue? I have the feeling I may be missing something obvious: http://jsfiddle.net/mrc3C/8/
[23:02:28] <qawsedrf> i'll try that
[23:02:30] <qawsedrf> but tell me something
[23:02:36] <qawsedrf> i'm no expet but http://pastie.org/2989784
[23:03:00] <qawsedrf> found that in jq source, couldnt they have used
[23:03:02] <qawsedrf> nvm
[23:03:07] <Cork> hmm

[23:04:13] <Cork> qawsedrf: wow. didn't even know contents did cross document checks
[23:04:31] <Cork> then no i don't know why that wouldn't work
[23:14:02] <arena_> I need help with this piece of code: http://jsfiddle.net/mrc3C/8/
[23:17:48] <qawsedrf> Cork: :)
[23:18:53] <qawsedrf> also $('iframt')[0].document wont work
[23:21:08] <ajaxbud> Hi Guys,
[23:21:34] <[mgw]> suppp
[23:21:47] <coldhead> lol bud
[23:21:48] <ajaxbud> I have a textbox inside which I can enter values which will be stored as li (list) tags
[23:22:27] <ajaxbud> I want to read the values of all such li tags and store them in an array and send them to server
[23:22:32] <ajaxbud> How could this be chieved
[23:22:48] <[mgw]> uh
[23:22:55] <ajaxbud> I am trying $(textboxtag).change function
[23:23:12] <ajaxbud> but it does not allow me to construct an array, or does it?
[23:23:17] <[mgw]> be more specific
[23:23:26] <[mgw]> on your textbook
[23:23:29] <[mgw]> textbox*
[23:23:40] <[mgw]> how does it go from textbox->li
[23:23:44] <ajaxbud> ok let me paste the chunk of code here
[23:23:55] <ajaxbud> it is auto generated by a plugin tht I am using
[23:24:17] <ajaxbud> I will be specific: I am entering the name of movies in my textbox
[23:24:31] <[mgw]> like comma delimitted?
[23:24:33] <ajaxbud> when I enter the names, the plugin stored the names in <li> tags
[23:25:04] <ajaxbud> $("#demo-input-facebook-theme").change(function(event)
[23:25:05] <ajaxbud>                 {
[23:25:05] <ajaxbud>                  var str = $("li.token-input-token-facebook p").text()+',';
[23:25:06] <ajaxbud> }
[23:25:14] <[mgw]> and that's all gravy, you want the li to goto a separate request
[23:25:16] <ajaxbud> this gives me the values that I have entered
[23:25:23] <ajaxbud> but they are all concatenated
[23:25:34] <[mgw]> ok, the easy answer is to use $.each
[23:25:42] <[mgw]> but one of the guys here i'm sure has a better more efficient answer
[23:25:50] <[mgw]> jquery isfull of neat tricks
[23:25:58] <ajaxbud> $.each on the textbox?
[23:26:02] <[mgw]> no with the li
[23:26:09] <[mgw]> you said you want to send li to an array
[23:26:15] <ajaxbud> yea right
[23:26:17] <[mgw]> you could do it on the textbox as well
[23:26:22] <ajaxbud> I tried that mgw
[23:26:22] <[mgw]> that's more a design decision
[23:26:37] <[mgw]> hummm
[23:26:45] <ajaxbud> but somehow it was not entering the each function of li at all
[23:27:07] <[mgw]> weird
[23:27:24] <[mgw]> did yo console.log($('string').length)?
[23:28:35] <ajaxbud> ok it enters
[23:28:39] <ajaxbud> I just checked now
[23:28:42] <ajaxbud> but again
[23:28:46] <ajaxbud> I have another problem
[23:28:56] <ajaxbud> the text inside li is stored in <p> tags
[23:29:15] <ajaxbud> how do I fetch that value exactly inside the each function of li?
[23:29:38] <[mgw]> $('li>p')
[23:29:46] <[mgw]> or
[23:29:49] <[mgw]> oh right
[23:29:54] <[mgw]> $(this).children('p').text()
[23:29:57] <IgnisDiabolus> $('li').each(function() { $(this).children('p).html()
[23:30:03] <IgnisDiabolus> or text()
[23:30:04] <IgnisDiabolus> :3
[23:30:10] <[mgw]> ;]
[23:30:25] <ajaxbud> let me try it now
[23:30:26] <ajaxbud> thanks guys
[23:30:28] <ajaxbud> :)
[23:30:31] <IgnisDiabolus> or .find('p).text()
[23:30:37] <ajaxbud> yeah will try that too
[23:30:41] <Smekman> ANyone know how to create a overlay when hoviring a link?
[23:30:51] <Smekman> hovering *
[23:31:42] <[mgw]> what?
[23:31:55] <IgnisDiabolus> z-index: 999999
[23:32:07] <[mgw]> i was working on a jquery plugin a while back
[23:32:20] <[mgw]> it attempted to turn any element into an overlay el
[23:32:24] <IgnisDiabolus> position: absolute;  then get the position based on the position of the link. guess so
[23:32:40] <[mgw]> so like you copied it in the DOM
[23:32:54] <[mgw]> same size+pos and you could do whatever shit you wanted on it
[23:33:14] <[mgw]> proved trciky :D
[23:33:23] <IgnisDiabolus> i did same. append and shit
[23:33:39] <Smekman> Huh
[23:34:06] <IgnisDiabolus> $.shit() function... it does everything you want it to do :3
[23:34:38] <Smekman> Well, I'm new to jquery, so this is kinda like speaking in riddles to me. I did find a partial solution, but it's based on hoverin an image and tacs on the left side instead of the right, consuming half the image
[23:34:40] <qawsedrf> how do you create text node in jquery ?
[23:34:44] <[mgw]> ;)
[23:35:10] <IgnisDiabolus> qawsedrf, there's .text()
[23:35:17] <qawsedrf> so $.text('sup') ?
[23:35:22] <IgnisDiabolus> .html(), .append(), .appendTo()
[23:35:26] <qawsedrf> lemme try
[23:35:42] <qawsedrf> nah
[23:35:50] <Smekman> link <--[Overlay with description of link] .. SOmething like that is what I had in mind
[23:36:05] <IgnisDiabolus> $('#elemId').text('sup');
[23:36:16] <IgnisDiabolus> Smekman, google jquery tooltip plugin
[23:36:20] <codeho> morning
[23:37:13] <qawsedrf> i wanna mimic document.createTextNode('sup') in jquery
[23:37:22] <Smekman> Oh them's be cool
[23:37:33] <[mgw]> yam
[23:37:42] <Smekman> Thank you Ignis, although i see no parameter for the layout of the tooltip box
[23:37:46] <[mgw]> yea i was trying to make an easy plugint o do that smekman
[23:37:52] <Smekman> Which is kinda .. "Wut wut?"
[23:38:36] <[mgw]> so it'd be like $(selector).overlay().offset([20,-10])
[23:39:55] <IgnisDiabolus> i think the purpose of jQuery is to make coding javascript easier and not replace it. why would you like to replace something like var myText = document.createTextNode('yeah baby! yeah!');
[23:40:34] <[mgw]> haha
[23:40:52] <IgnisDiabolus> you can have var myText = 'yeah baby! yeah!'; then append it using .text, .html, .append, etc...
[23:41:10] <lyrae> Hi. When a form is submitted, before it is i gather all <li>s from a <ul> I try to loop throught he li's before submitting. If i have a for loop, the form submits even though i have return false;. If the loop isnt there, then the form doesnt submit as expected
[23:41:16] <lyrae> http://bpaste.net/show/20829/
[23:41:32] <[mgw]> errr
[23:41:43] <[mgw]> why are you guys coming with <li> questions and submission stuff
[23:41:57] <lyrae> the question is mainly why the form submits if i have a loop
[23:42:02] <IgnisDiabolus> li's are hot
[23:42:04] <lyrae> inside the submit() function
[23:42:13] <[mgw]> lol, million methods
[23:42:27] <IgnisDiabolus> .submit(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); });
[23:42:32] <qawsedrf> IgnisDiabolus:
[23:42:34] <[mgw]> haha nice :D
[23:43:00] <[mgw]> why not replace javascript :P
[23:43:01] <qawsedrf> like $('</div>') mimincs document.createElement
[23:43:11] <qawsedrf> similarly what would mimic createTextNode
[23:43:24] <IgnisDiabolus> ...
[23:43:41] <Cork> qawsedrf: you don't mimic text nodes in jquery
[23:43:51] <Cork> you just put the text inside the parent
[23:44:03] <Cork> parent.append('some random text');
[23:44:13] <[mgw]> javascript replaced C++ in a roundabout way?  cell phones replaced corded phones?  lol
[23:44:29] <qawsedrf> ok sir
[23:44:50] <[mgw]> i'm working on some new stuffs, i hope and think it'll be cool anyway hehe
[23:45:05] <IgnisDiabolus> lyrae, $('ul.tabs').find('.edit').each(function(){ console.log($(this).attr('num'); });
[23:45:33] <lyrae> IgnisDiabolus: thansk i just found out about it and tried, but form seems to be still submitting. give me a sec
[23:46:12] <lyrae> nope it worked. thanks
[23:47:00] <IgnisDiabolus> http://bpaste.net/show/20830/
[23:47:07] <IgnisDiabolus> oh... i type too slow :(
[23:47:37] <IgnisDiabolus> actually, i think this.attr('num') would work :3
[23:48:23] <tga> random little thing, do you happen to know whether it's possible to have an <a> submit a form *without* javascript?
[23:48:42] <IgnisDiabolus> tga. no.
[23:49:04] <tga> thanks, that's what I thought
[23:52:19] <coldhead> spell bolour with a k?
[23:52:23] <coldhead> what a silly bunt
[23:52:49] <[mgw]> hummm
[23:53:28] <IgnisDiabolus> ...
[23:54:26] <[mgw]> yahhhhhh
[23:56:07] <Smekman> Eh ... Man the demo is kinda confusing
[23:57:33] <Smekman> The examples are good and everything, but i seem to be mising where they tell the tooltip what text to use for it
