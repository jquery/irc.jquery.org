[00:53:27] <w0bni> I have a list of ajax calls, with success callbacks. How can I wait until all of the success callbacks have completed before calling a new function?
[00:53:33] <hellyeah> hey
[00:53:51] <hellyeah> is there a way to make gray area of modal window small http://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/71/ just click the button
[00:54:24] <hellyeah> or disappear gray part and stick close to the table?
[00:56:14] <BlueShark> How can I animate a div with position: absolute?
[00:57:18] <BlueShark> It's a form centered in a page, and on submit, I want to move the form to the extreme left and display some HTML (result of the request) to the right.
[00:57:56] <BlueShark> This works: $('#main').css("position", "absolute"); $('#main').css('left', '-12%');  $('#main').css('top', '7px');
[00:58:06] <BlueShark> But then there's no animation. How would I accomplish that using .animate()?
[01:02:37] <mooncup> hm $.get is asynchronous right?
[01:02:43] <mooncup> there is no reason for it to make my page hang?
[01:05:45] <Uhkis> yes, unless you have ajaxsetup saying otherwise
[01:12:50] <mooncup> 10:05 < Uhkis> yes, unless you have ajaxsetup saying otherwise
[01:13:01] <mooncup> my browser is freezing whenever I click a button D:
[01:13:20] <mooncup> http://pastie.org/private/z4zry2eqfr5j72cmmsga
[01:15:54] <mooncup> hm actually looks like it's the .parse that is causing hte issue
[01:16:15] <mooncup> I took that out and changed the datatype to json and now I'm just getting a type error
[01:21:38] <hellyeah> edo you understand my quesytion
[01:22:18] <hellyeah> is there a way to make gray area of modal window small http://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/71/ just click the button. Or disappear gray part totally stick "close" to the upper part of table
[01:22:26] <hellyeah> "x"
[01:23:38] <Uhkis> mooncup: so you're getting something non-json and its big
[01:23:59] <mooncup> sorted it Uhkis
[01:24:05] <mooncup> I was passing the selector rather than the value
[01:24:09] <mooncup> so I assume the server was having a fit
[01:24:13] <mooncup> and therefore so was the client
[01:24:15] <mooncup> thanks though
[01:36:38] <BlueShark> How can I perform .animate based on a condition? var isAnimate = 1; if (isAnimate) { statements; isAnimate = 0; } - the if statement evaluates to true every time. What's wrong?
[01:37:13] <Cork> BlueShark: don't use 0/1 for boolean
[01:37:21] <Cork> js has true/false use them...
[01:37:29] <BlueShark> Cork: tried that too, but didn't work.
[01:37:34] <hellyeah> 2 * false gives 0
[01:37:37] <hellyeah> why is that?
[01:38:00] <Cork> hellyeah: cause false typecased to integer == 0
[01:38:03] <Cork> and 2 * 0 == 0
[01:38:18] <Cork> BlueShark: jsfiddle the related code
[01:40:48] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/73/ Cork can i individually set the width and height of row with jquery http://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/73/
[01:41:18] <Cork> hellyeah: you're not using jquery
[01:41:22] <Cork> you're using native js
[01:41:27] <Cork> but ya you can
[01:43:43] <hellyeah> native js works too
[01:43:45] <hellyeah> hmm
[01:43:57] <Cork> ya, but it gets much longer
[01:43:57] <hellyeah> native js is better
[01:44:13] <hellyeah> i try to learn how to write pure js
[01:44:20] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/74/
[01:44:26] <hellyeah> already
[01:44:27] <BlueShark> Cork: one moment please
[01:44:29] <hellyeah> you are fast
[01:44:31] <hellyeah> :D
[01:44:57] <BlueShark> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/ry3L6t64/
[01:45:25] <Cork> BlueShark: you store the variable locally in the event handler
[01:45:32] <Cork> so you get a new variable each click
[01:45:36] <Cork> so ya. it will always be true
[01:45:43] <BlueShark> Ah. How to make it global?
[01:45:50] <Cork> create it outside?
[01:46:04] <Cork> though you don't need it
[01:46:07] <Cork> ?api :animated
[01:46:16] <Cork> aaand the bot is dead...
[01:46:29] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/animated-selector/
[01:46:43] <Cork> so all you need is if($(this).is(':animated'))
[01:47:19] <Cork> well actually
[01:47:21] <hellyeah> Cork:  this is better btw my table looks like that
[01:47:30] <Cork> looking at the code you might actually mean something else (bad named variable)
[01:47:41] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/75/
[01:48:23] <BlueShark> Cork: I'm not sure I understand. What I'm trying to do is perform the animation only once.
[01:49:02] <BlueShark> So after the first animate, the button click should no longer animate.
[01:49:05] <BlueShark> How can I do that?
[01:49:11] <Cork> BlueShark: https://jsfiddle.net/ry3L6t64/1/
[01:49:18] <Cork> but remember animate runs async
[01:49:30] <Cork> so the value after it will be set even before the animation start
[01:56:58] <Bjerre> Goooood morning
[01:57:06] <Cork>  vietnam
[01:57:13] <Bjerre> poor robin :(
[02:01:04] <hellyeah> i suppose this button will appear after closing pop up but it doesnt work that way can you look at it? http://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/77/
[02:01:53] <Cork> hellyeah: no, js isn't threaded
[02:02:05] <hellyeah> threaded?
[02:02:08] <Cork> show will fire when the dialog is created
[02:02:15] <hellyeah> humm
[02:02:16] <Cork> meaning show will happen as you create the dialog
[02:02:21] <hellyeah> ic
[02:02:22] <Cork> it won't hang there until it is closed
[02:02:30] <Cork> also you forgot the # in the selector
[02:02:48] <hellyeah> ops
[02:03:08] <Cork> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/78/
[02:03:27] <hellyeah> i have many tab open atm
[02:03:31] <hellyeah> i am confused sometimes
[02:03:33] <hellyeah> :O
[02:03:59] <hellyeah> humm
[02:04:08] <hellyeah> close is pop up function i guess
[02:04:09] <hellyeah> right
[02:04:15] <Cork> callback
[02:04:30] <DanielCE> when i send dataType : 'json', the data is an json object , when i do do that i need to run json parse to create object from the json string. i waonder what is more efficiant regarding resources
[02:05:06] <Cork> DanielCE: dataType isn't what jquery should take the response as
[02:05:20] <Cork> dataType is to tell the server "if you have an option i would prefer to get the response as json"
[02:05:32] <Cork> it is up to the server to tell the client what content type it sends
[02:05:46] <Cork> (Content-Type: application/json)
[02:05:55] <Cork> if the server sets this http header you won't need to parse the json
[02:06:14] <DanielCE> when i set the datatype to json then the response i get (data) is aalready an object
[02:06:29] <DanielCE> if i dont put anything it a json string which i have to parse
[02:06:31] <Cork> then it means the server sets the header correctly
[02:07:02] <Cork> so... what is the question exactly?
[02:07:27] <Cork> if it already works as expected i'm not sure what you're after
[02:08:22] <DanielCE> the question is what save resources
[02:08:26] <DanielCE> what more efficiant
[02:09:25] <DanielCE> datatype : json which makes it automaticly an object OR get it as string and parseJSON
[02:52:42] <Bjerre> how's .NET with front end development?
[02:53:29] <Bjerre> not like it has to do with jquery or anything but I'm starting some lessons after summer and I have never worked with C#
[02:54:03] <Uhkis> its for backend
[02:54:09] <Bjerre> :/
[02:54:27] <Bjerre> I still have 2 days to chose the other course instead
[02:54:35] <Bjerre> which is mainly javascript and frontend development
[02:54:43] <Bjerre> but everyone says that I should go with .net
[02:55:55] <Bjerre> I probably asked you this already Uhkis but what would you do in my situation
[02:56:11] <Bjerre> I have no knowledge of backend
[02:56:20] <Uhkis> i said .net last time
[02:56:29] <Bjerre> ye
[02:56:31] <Bjerre> I know
[02:56:36] <Bjerre> but what do you say now? :D
[02:56:41] <Uhkis> same
[02:56:42] <Bjerre> ok
[02:56:44] <Bjerre> dangit
[02:57:04] <Bjerre> is the language similar to javascript/jquery?
[02:58:26] <Uhkis> nope
[02:58:52] <Bjerre> ok, well I gotta believe in myself
[02:58:54] <Bjerre> that I can do it
[02:59:16] <Bjerre> However, I'm more of a front end I believe
[02:59:26] <Bjerre> but I guess it's good to know them both
[02:59:54] <Uhkis> ofc it is
[03:00:59] <Bjerre> :)
[03:01:15] <Bjerre> it is possible to combine both c# and javascript/jquery?
[03:01:22] <Bjerre> stupid question I guess
[03:02:16] <Bjerre> but like I said, I have no idea when and where you use C#.
[03:02:21] <Bjerre> so this will be interesting...
[03:02:27] <Uhkis> thats called web dev, not sure if youve heard of it :-D
[03:02:40] <Bjerre> haha ye stupid question I know
[03:02:50] <Bjerre> I was more looking for where and when to use it
[03:03:34] <Uhkis> you use it for anything server side
[03:03:46] <Bjerre> ok
[03:04:00] <Uhkis> db connections etc
[03:04:36] <Bjerre> wait do you use c# for unity?
[03:05:22] <Bjerre> the worst part with this course Uhkis is that I need to use windows
[03:05:43] <Bjerre> if I'm not wrong
[03:05:53] <Uhkis> so what
[03:06:00] <Bjerre> cba bootcamp :E
[03:06:30] <Uhkis> eww, osx user
[03:06:35] <Bjerre> :(
[03:06:43] <Bjerre>  /kill
[03:18:56] <Bjerre> so you're using windows or linux Uhkis
[03:20:26] <Uhkis> s/or/and/
[03:21:28] <Bjerre> ? Well I'm wondering if you've been testing w10
[03:22:01] <Bjerre> explorer edge seems promising
[03:22:20] <Uhkis> of course not
[03:24:30] <Bjerre> sk√•l
[03:24:39] <Uhkis> kippis!
[03:24:47] <Uhkis> but later, it's way too early to drink now
[03:25:08] <Bjerre> well you can always cheer with coffee
[03:25:16] <Bjerre> at least at my place
[03:26:09] <Bjerre> is kippis finnish?
[03:26:35] <Bjerre> I thought you were swedish
[03:26:42] <Uhkis> no way
[03:27:06] <Uhkis> and yes kippis is finnish version of sk√•l
[03:32:40] <Bjerre> so there is an eventlistener that's called taphold right?
[03:32:43] <Bjerre> in both js and jquery
[03:33:41] <Uhkis> ?mdn taphold
[03:33:48] <Uhkis> oh, bot's dead
[03:34:55] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/gdzs1to9/1/ overkill or not Uhkis ?
[03:35:16] <Bjerre> it's on both tablets and w mouse
[03:37:45] <hellyeah> hey
[03:37:47] <hellyeah> anyone here
[03:38:06] <hellyeah> need to remove gray part of modal windows it is really anooying
[03:38:15] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/78/ click the button
[03:39:14] <Bjerre> grey bar?
[03:39:42] <Bjerre> the one behind the close button?
[03:40:33] <Uhkis> Bjerre: nah
[03:41:06] <Bjerre> ok cool
[03:41:53] <Bjerre> is there a chance that javascripts get's unloaded after a while on the site? I don't know how the garbage collector work but I assume it never removes things that are set to global right?
[03:42:31] <Bjerre> I have a refresh that starts if the user is inactive and will refresh site with a 5 minute timer
[03:42:37] <Bjerre> so I guess it wont be a problem
[03:43:38] <hellyeah> i am newbie on modal window can you help me to apply this effect? http://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/79/
[03:47:57] <mooncup> I'm creating an element
[03:48:05] <mooncup> then using .data('x','y') on it
[03:48:12] <mooncup> then appending it to another element
[03:48:18] <mooncup> it gets appended, but without the data tags
[03:48:19] <mooncup> any ideas?
[03:49:21] <Uhkis> .data isn't for settings data- attributes
[03:49:26] <Uhkis> setting*
[03:50:14] <Uhkis> mooncup: https://api.jquery.com/data/
[03:50:29] <mooncup> blergh
[03:50:37] <mooncup> my whole life has been a lie
[03:50:38] <mooncup> :<
[03:51:01] <mooncup> thanks Uhkis
[03:51:15] <Uhkis> sorry for ruining your life! :D
[03:52:16] <mooncup> I guess it doesn't really matter as long as I can still access the data though
[03:54:07] <Bjerre> Uhkis: http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/gdzs1to9/2/  any idea on set the eventlistener to keyup and keydown? do I need the keycode to get it working? Everything else works but not the arrow keys
[03:55:18] <hellyeah> hey
[03:55:29] <hellyeah> i succeded to hide title bar http://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/80/
[03:55:33] <alluringme> Hi, is there a way to know who clicked on my Google ad using Jquery?
[03:55:40] <hellyeah> but i need close symbol to the upper part of table
[03:55:45] <hellyeah> how can i do that?
[03:56:20] <Bjerre> well you shouldn't hide it, just change the width to fixed on it
[03:56:26] <Uhkis> Bjerre: that error probably breaks everything
[03:56:59] <Bjerre> nah Uhkis the semi colons doesn't matter in this case
[03:57:07] <Bjerre> the problem is the keyup and down
[03:57:13] <Bjerre> that isn't triggering the function
[03:57:28] <Uhkis> Bjerre: line 11 triggers an actual error
[03:57:46] <Bjerre> it's for the editor
[03:57:51] <Bjerre> not working with fiddle
[03:57:58] <Bjerre> no worries
[03:58:15] <Bjerre> the editor handles things different
[03:58:20] <Bjerre> that's why it's a struggle with everything
[03:58:24] <Bjerre> since they have a very bad faq
[03:58:46] <Bjerre> but that line is no problem within the editor. The problem is how to trigger the function with key up and down
[03:59:09] <Bjerre> I use left, right, up and down arrows. I thought it would be easier just to use any keyup or down to start function
[03:59:14] <Bjerre> or reset in this case
[03:59:49] <Uhkis> try adding the event as parameter for the function? no idea
[04:00:47] <Bjerre> hmm might work
[04:01:44] <hellyeah> need some help
[04:02:05] <hellyeah> i disappear annmoying title bar
[04:02:14] <hellyeah> but i need something to close pop

[04:24:30] <sunny__> Cork local side
[04:24:37] <Cork> you need to use a filereader
[04:24:49] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader
[04:24:50] <sunny__> the image i want to convert is from client side
[04:25:13] <Cork> so the flow is input type="file", user picks the image
[04:25:27] <Cork> you take the file from the input and use the filereader to read it as a blob or bytearray
[04:26:33] <sunny__> Cork any fiddle of this one so i can check

[04:29:04] <rominronin> where can I find the distance from the top of an element?
[04:29:07] <Cork> ya, that one looks fairly complete

[04:29:26] <hellyeah> Cork:  any help for me?
[04:29:26] <sunny__> Cork
[04:29:29] <Cork> rominronin: the distance from the top to what?
[04:30:54] <rominronin> eg. the number of pixels distanct between the top edge of the window/viewport to the top edge of an element ul.fix

[04:31:41] <alluringme> Hi anyway to track Google adclicks using Jqury?
[04:31:49] <alluringme> Jquery*
[04:32:02] <Cork> didn't you ask that like yesterday?
[04:32:19] <sunny__> hey Cork   http://jsfiddle.net/0GiS0/Yvgc2/ not work for me
[04:32:24] <alluringme> Yes, thats correct.
[04:32:36] <rominronin> why might offset().top return an incorrect value? it returns 0, but the element is clearly not aligned to the top. could it be returning a position value?
[04:32:38] <Cork> alluringme: why would the answer change?
[04:32:51] <rominronin> css top position is 0
[04:33:02] <alluringme> But, I want to associate a user name with it and store it on my own DB. Cant I track the iframe?
[04:33:25] <alluringme> Username is fetched from DB if they login.
[04:33:26] <Cork> alluringme: you can track that an iframe from a different domain exist
[04:33:28] <alluringme> Just wanted to be sure.
[04:33:33] <Cork> but no you don't have access to what is in it
[04:34:10] <Cork> alluringme: that part is fundamental to the xss protection browsers provide
[04:34:28] <Cork> it would be quite a sever security bug if you didn't get blocked
[04:34:56] <Cork> sunny__: works fine here
[04:35:26] <sunny__> Cork really sorry it's not canvert the image into byte array
[04:35:34] <AmirHossein> hi, friends i have problem with jqueryui but do not got answer in #jqueryui-dev can ask here?
[04:35:43] <alluringme> Cork, just to clarrify; Say user 'x' logs on to my site. Later clicks a Google ad. When he logs in his username is in a cookie; Now assuming he clicks a Google ad, can't I know which user clicked it if I associate the cookie to his/her ip and username and store it back on PHP end? I just want a way to track who clicked it lol
[04:36:23] <alluringme> I do not want to do anything with the contents in the iframe itself.
[04:36:45] <sunny__> Cork you change something in this one
[04:36:47] <Cork> alluringme: ya, cause it reads it as a readAsDataURL
[04:36:57] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[04:36:59] <Cork> sunny__: ^
[04:37:06] <Cork> read the documentation i linked you
[04:37:38] <rominronin> Cork: why might offset().top return 0 if the element is NOT at the top of the window?
[04:37:38] <Cork> alluringme: you can't know what he clicked; period
[04:37:49] <sunny__> FileReader.readAsArrayBuffer()
[04:37:52] <Cork> alluringme: the image is inside the iframe and you have no access what so ever to it
[04:38:03] <Cork> rominronin: make a jsfiddle
[04:38:13] <rominronin> k, will try
[04:38:26] <alluringme> Hmm, I was confused as I read this. Thus asked this again. http://www.icemelon.com/tutorials/17/Track_Google_Adsense_Clicks.htm

[04:39:17] <sunny__> Cork i done somethiing like this var r=  picReader.readAsArrayBuffer(file);   console.log(r);
[04:39:28] <Cork> no it doesn't work like that
[04:39:33] <Cork> again, read the documentation
[04:39:34] <sunny__> then how
[04:39:39] <Cork> don't copy and slash
[04:39:47] <Cork> understand the api
[04:40:07] <sunny__> plz help on this
[04:40:12] <alluringme> Cork, can you please take a quick look at link thanks. I would never bother to ask again lol.
[04:41:17] <workerbeetwo> Hi.
[04:41:48] <workerbeetwo> I'd like to selet such an id :   j_idt189:j_idt217:j_idt219:tmpcontent  . how to?
[04:41:59] <Cork> ouch
[04:42:16] <Cork> sigh... who do backend keep generating these fucked up ids...
[04:42:16] <workerbeetwo> ending with tmpcontent is the essential part.
[04:42:23] <alluringme> lol
[04:42:25] <sunny__> Cork any help
[04:42:27] <workerbeetwo> Cork: well its JSF 2.
[04:42:40] <pratyk> Hi
[04:42:41] <Cork> workerbeetwo: $('#j_idt189\\:j_idt217\\:j_idt219\\:tmpcontent')
[04:42:55] <workerbeetwo> Cork: thosej_idt are variable.
[04:43:05] <workerbeetwo> its about the tmpcontent thats stable.
[04:43:08] <Cork> workerbeetwo: then you will have to list all the variants
[04:43:14] <Cork> workerbeetwo: ids doesn't work like that
[04:43:25] <Cork> workerbeetwo: check if they have a class
[04:43:30] <Cork> and use that instead
[04:43:40] <workerbeetwo> I thought there is a way of saying "ending on tmpcontent"
[04:43:47] <Cork> not for ids no
[04:43:59] <workerbeetwo> ok. let me check.
[04:44:00] <Cork> you can make a slow attribute selector instead
[04:44:13] <Cork> but you should _REALLY_ avoid that if you have a choice
[04:44:36] <Cork> (and the choice before that option should be "fix the server")
[04:44:57] <pratyk>  When using $.ajax I get data from rest api I get 403 error. But when the rest api accesses from browser rest api extenstion like Postman. I get 200 and data.
[04:45:22] <pratyk> How do I debug this.
[04:45:25] <Cork> pratyk: might be wrong content type
[04:45:39] <Cork> might be it sniffs for xhr requests and explicitly forbid them
[04:45:50] <Cork> or you just aren't accessing the same url
[04:46:22] <alluringme> Cork, so this is it then :O <Cork>alluringme: you can't know what he clicked; period
[04:46:44] <sunny__> Cork any help
[04:46:49] <Cork> alluringme: if the content you are interested in, is inside an iframe loaded from another domain; yes
[04:46:53] <sunny__> how it's work i done the same
[04:47:02] <sunny__> sorry not work
[04:47:11] <Cork> sunny__: i've given you the lead you will have to look up how to do it
[04:47:22] <Cork> mdn has all the needed info with examples
[04:47:30] <sunny__> Cork i tried but it's not work for me
[04:47:32] <Cork> (i have work i need to do, not just help ppl here)
[04:47:35] <pratyk> Cork: I'm using the right content type and correct url
[04:47:51] <alluringme> Thank you once again Cork. I will stop with it once and for all lol
[04:48:41] <pratyk> It works when accessed from chrome extension Postman or Advanced Rest Client
[04:49:41] <Cork> pratyk: firstly is the page your running it from on the same domain as the end point?
[04:50:05] <pratyk> No CORS issue
[04:50:35] <Cork> then check what url and request content-type you're sending (possibly the params)
[04:50:41] <Cork> if all are the same it should work
[04:52:33] <sunny__> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/ZTHJB/4/ sam i done but not work
[04:52:39] <sunny__> now plz help
[04:53:28] <Cork> sigh...
[04:53:35] <Cork> sunny__: you know how async works?
[04:53:43] <sunny__> common dude
[04:53:49] <sunny__> no
[04:54:15] <Cork> async works in that you create an object you bind a callback
[04:54:18] <Cork> and then request data
[04:54:24] <Cork> the data, when the browser has it
[04:54:28] <sunny__> ok
[04:54:30] <Cork> gets returned to the callback you defined
[04:55:05] <Cyclohexane> Why does this click event only work if I add put a breakpoint on it? http://pastebin.com/DVvb1yFU
[04:55:15] <sunny__> any thing wrong done in my fiddle
[04:55:32] <Cork> sunny__: i just explained what's wrong
[04:56:01] <Cork> sunny__: currently you 1. create an object, 2. request data, 3. bind a callback
[04:56:07] <Cork> meaning you will miss the answer
[04:56:33] <sunny__> but in my one i done the same
[04:57:29] <pratyk> Cork: Everything is same but it still doesn't work. I'm scratching my head since last 4 hrs. :)
[04:57:57] <Cork> pratyk: you would have to provide a link then
[04:58:00] <sunny__> Cork everything is right headache fir me
[04:58:05] <decx> Cyclohexane: the datatables data is loaded async do table.on('click', '.viewButton', fn) instead
[04:58:30] <Cork> sunny__: so you really don't see the difference between 1. create object, 2. bind callback, 3. request data
[04:58:42] <Cork> sunny__: and 1. create object, 2. requerst data, 3. bind callback ?
[05:02:24] <Cyclohexane> decx: ah thanks :)
[05:17:22] <DanielCE> anyone is professional on repaint issues?
[05:17:39] <hellyeah> hey
[05:18:10] <hellyeah> how can i put image to close thing in modal window i want to put an image  http://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/85/ click the button
[05:23:49] <taplar> you want to use an image instead of the default X for the close option?
[05:49:09] <BoLGo> Hi all, I was wondering how I could achieve the following: http://jsbin.com/jimidifoca/edit?html,css,js,output
[05:49:55] <BoLGo> Obviously this snippet isn't working 100% as I'd like it to. It's only taking into account the last event I provided. How can I make it execute the same function with 3 events without rewriting it 3x (I know you can pass an object to on() as a first parameter)
[05:52:30] <BoLGo> Nvm. I knew I had done this before some time ago, but forgot the first argument needs to be space separated rather than comma separated. Fixed it myself: http://jsbin.com/jimidifoca/edit?html,css,js,output
[05:59:39] <Abhijit> what am I doing wrong here? $("#ved").text('First.'+'</br>'+'second.');
[06:00:40] <hassoon> Abhijit: try to leave a soace between + and the adjacent characters 's
[06:00:50] <hassoon> *space
[06:01:08] <Abhijit> does </br> is ok or it should be '</br>'
[06:01:34] <Uhkis> it most certainly should not be </br>
[06:01:39] <Abhijit> ok
[06:01:43] <Uhkis> either <br> or <br/>
[06:02:10] <Abhijit> oh right.
[06:02:23] <Uhkis> secondly, your string should be: 'First.</br>second.'
[06:04:24] <Abhijit> Uhkis,  $("#ved").text('First.<br/>second.'); do not work. <br> also do not work here.
[06:04:34] <Cork> also .text('<br>') will generate &apos;First.&lt;/br&gt;second.
[06:04:41] <Cork> you most likely want .html
[06:04:46] <Cork> opps
[06:05:00] <Cork> * also .text('First.'+'<br>'+'second.') will generate &apos;First.&lt;/br&gt;second.
[06:05:10] <Abhijit> let my try html.
[06:05:31] <Uhkis> Cork: huh?
[06:05:36] <Abhijit> yes. html work Cork
[06:05:37] <Uhkis> that makes no sense
[06:05:47] <Cork> Uhkis: .text escapes html entitys
[06:05:57] <Abhijit>  $("#ved").html('First.<br/>second.'); works
[06:05:59] <Cork> entities even
[06:06:14] <Uhkis> Cork: but that first apostrophe is just a start of string?
[06:07:23] <muranjan> $.getJSON("http://localhost/profile2/1", function(jsonResult) {
[06:07:24] <muranjan> 	  	var $select = $('#specializations');
[06:07:25] <muranjan> 	    $.each(jsonResult, function(key, value) {
[06:07:25] <muranjan> 	    	 $select.append('<option value=' + key + '>' + value + '</option>');  }); });
[06:08:10] <muranjan> I am getting [object Object] inside dropdown
[06:08:24] <Cork> Uhkis: sure, but .text uses innerText and textContent
[06:08:46] <Cork> Uhkis: and those dom properties will escape to html entities
[06:09:00] <Cork> so < becomes &apos; for example
[06:09:10] <Uhkis> no, it becomes &lt;
[06:09:17] <Cork> ah... ya, sorry
[06:09:26] <Cork> wrong copy paste
[06:09:50] <muranjan> while my json is like this  [{"id‚Äù:1,‚Äùvalue":"Anotomy"},{"id‚Äù:2,‚Äùvalue‚Äù:‚Äùtest‚Äù}]
[06:10:16] <Uhkis> well, as long as text() doesn't do any weird ' suddenly isn't string delimiter :D
[06:10:28] <Cork> muranjan: ya, so you get the object and you use that as display value
[06:10:43] <Cork> instead of value.id and value.value
[06:11:02] <Cork> Uhkis: ya, i didn't even see that it was included in what i pasted -_-'
[06:11:21] <Cork> (was lazy and ran it through https://mothereff.in/html-entities )
[06:11:45] <Uhkis> Cork: you're clearly really waiting for the weekend :D
[06:12:05] <Cork> Uhkis: i'm waiting for vacation
[06:12:12] <Cork> it's 4 weeks away though...
[06:12:22] <Cork> well 3
[06:12:23] <Uhkis> mine's halfway done
[06:12:31] <Uhkis> only 2 more weeks left
[06:13:03] <Cork> well the good part is that i'm sitting in a climate controlled office :)
[06:13:42] <Cork> a perfect 21∞C no matter the outside temp ^^
[06:14:03] <decx> 25 here
[06:14:12] <decx> but i just got from outside where it's 35
[06:14:59] <muranjan> Cork: perfect it is working
[06:15:16] <exploreshaifali> I am trying to use jquery-ui date and time picker,  working in chrome but not in firefox browser, in browser console it gives error - **TypeError: $(...).datepicker is not a function**
[06:15:24] <muranjan> thanks can you plz give some more light on why it was not getting in key
[06:15:31] <Uhkis> Cork: lucky you, our offices AC is completely broken, it was ~28C inside when it was ~15 outside
[06:15:32] <muranjan> and value
[06:15:41] <Cork> ouch
[06:15:54] <Cork> muranjan: you're looping the array
[06:15:57] <Uhkis> i don't even wanna think about the temperature there now that it's 28C outside :D
[06:16:13] <Cork> muranjan: so the key is 0,1,2,3,4... and the value is {}, {}
[06:16:24] <Cork> lol ya
[06:16:27] <Cork> Uhkis: ^
[06:16:49] <Cork> Uhkis: before we moved we had simple wall mounted acs
[06:16:52] <Cork> it... was pain
[06:16:59] <decx> in the neck literally
[06:17:42] <Cork> the one sitting in the flow of the unit was using think skiing cloths
[06:18:20] <Uhkis> i recall this one summer job i had, the ac was cranked up to the max, it was around 15C there
[06:18:25] <muranjan> Cork: yes so one value {"id":0,"value":"Anotomy"}, is not coming in key as I am getting value in value.id value.value
[06:18:28] <Cork> and the one next to him was sitting in shorts and t-shirt and sweting like a pig :)
[06:18:50] <Cork> muranjan: you're forgetting that you have two layers
[06:18:58] <Cork> muranjan: [{},{}] is an array of objects
[06:19:03] <Uhkis> never had that many colds during a summer
[06:19:09] <Cork> muranjan: so when you loop the array key is index in the array
[06:19:13] <Cork> muranjan: and value is the object
[06:19:26] <Cork> Uhkis: i bet
[06:20:03] <Cork> ac can be a real monster if you sit in the draught from it
[06:21:01] <Uhkis> ye, especially when it's 30C outside and you're wearing light clothes because of that
[06:21:49] <Cork> ya
[06:21:57] <muranjan> Cork: Thanks a ton bro
[06:22:01] <muranjan> :)
[06:22:06] <muranjan> got it now
[06:23:13] <exploreshaifali> is datepciker no more a function in Jquery-ui, why I am getting error **TypeError: $(...).datepicker is not a function**
[06:23:38] <Cork> exploreshaifali: 1. you haven't loaded a complete jquery ui lib
[06:23:46] <Cork> or 2. $ isn't jquery
[06:24:04] <Cork> or actually 3. you haven't loaded jquery ui at all
[06:25:12] <exploreshaifali> Cork, I have loaded jquery and jquery-ui css and js file with CDN, like - http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.0/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[06:25:31] <Cork> exploreshaifali: so you haven't loaded jquery ui at all?
[06:25:51] <sopparus> anyone understand how I can get a return value on http://jqueryui.com/slider/#multiple-vertical ? meaning if i drag the master volume to the middle I'd like 50 as a var
[06:25:56] <Cork> exploreshaifali: as in http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.0/jquery-ui.min.js
[06:26:02] <exploreshaifali> Cork, I have loaded jquery ui, they are loaded correctly
[06:26:06] <exploreshaifali> all thee files
[06:26:15] <Cork> then it should work just fine
[06:26:26] <exploreshaifali> jquery, jquery-ui css and also jquery-ui js
[06:26:33] <Cork> just make sure you load them in the correct order
[06:26:48] <exploreshaifali> also I tried to replace $ with getElementsByClassName
[06:27:08] <Cork> that would definitely break things
[06:27:11] <exploreshaifali> Cork, they are in correct order as mentioned - jquery, jquery-ui css and also jquery-ui js
[06:27:25] <Cork> exploreshaifali: that would be in the wrong order
[06:28:11] <Cork> the correct order is jquery ui css, your css, jquery, jquery ui and finally your js
[06:28:14] <exploreshaifali> Cork, I tried with jquery-ui css, jquery, jquery-ui js also--- is this is also wrong?
[06:28:53] <exploreshaifali> Cork, datepicker is working in Chrome but not in firefox
[06:29:06] <Cork> exploreshaifali: do you have an url for this?
[06:29:43] <exploreshaifali> Cork, I can copy and paste the code?
[06:29:59] <Cork> sure
[06:30:03] <Cork> jsbin.com it
[06:31:12] <exploreshaifali> Cork, ok, though the order for my css and js is not as what you mentioned, so I should try once my own!
[06:37:28] <exploreshaifali> Cork, Thanks! After shifting my js down to jquery-ui js, datepicker worked in forefox also :)
[06:37:39] <exploreshaifali> Cork, but do we not have timepicker?
[06:37:52] <Cork> not that i know of no
[06:38:01] <Cork> there are third party plugins for that though
[06:38:29] <exploreshaifali> Cork, which are? if you know
[06:38:38] <Cork> google is your friend :)
[06:38:50] <exploreshaifali> okay! Thanks Cork
[07:23:33] <Zeranoe> Does jquery provide an easy way to modify the content of several <td> elements? I need to add an asterisk before and after the content inside <td></td>, but each <td> element has different content
[07:25:14] <decx> so you want a condition to these asterisks?
[07:25:48] <Zeranoe> decx: Not sure what you mean
[07:25:52] <decx> elements.html(function(index,html){}) will give you the option to loop through the collection and do stuff with the old html
[07:34:10] <hellyeah> hey
[07:34:13] <hellyeah> no one here
[07:36:32] <rumpel> hellyeah, i wouldn't say that. You need patience on IRC.
[07:36:47] <hellyeah> yes i know
[07:37:13] <Guest94430> Hello everyone, is there a possibility to check wether a given URL's Response is either a CSS Format, or JS format?, i can probably read the header for CSS? But what about JS?
[07:37:47] <hellyeah> can you help me little bit i got null from line 33 but popup already open so i can take this value i guess http://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/109/ click the button and you will see popup
[07:42:08] <Zeranoe> I must be doing something incorrect here. I'm trying to add the word 'test' before the value of the <td>. http://jsbin.com/reyoyiwino/edit?html,js,output
[07:42:52] <Zeranoe> decx: ^^
[07:43:14] <decx> what do you think val() is ?
[07:43:30] <Zeranoe> decx: What the <td> contains...?
[07:43:34] <decx> no
[07:43:42] <decx> first of all in this context this is window
[07:44:01] <decx> and second only some form elements have a value property
[07:44:15] <Zeranoe> Oh
[07:44:32] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/cyzLfv20/
[07:46:57] <Zeranoe> decx: Wow, not sure how that actually works, but it does: http://jsbin.com/reyoyiwino/edit?html,js,output
[07:47:28] <decx> if you dont have a condition for the * just use after and before css
[07:47:58] <Zeranoe> ?
[07:48:11] <decx> http://jsbin.com/culedejupi/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[07:49:47] <Zeranoe> decx: This needs to have a broad browser support, and I'm guessing that's a CSS3 thing?
[07:50:19] <decx> ie9 safe
[07:50:44] <Zeranoe> decx: I think the jquery solution is perfect
[07:50:56] <decx> not really
[07:50:58] <Uhkis> didn't know html() can take a function as argument, nice
[07:51:11] <Zeranoe> decx: I need down to IE 7
[07:51:25] <decx> they'll do fine without *
[07:51:57] <decx> Uhkis: most methods can
[07:51:58] <Zeranoe> decx: ? I need the *
[07:52:16] <decx> if you need the * then let your server output it ;)
[07:52:45] <Zeranoe> decx: It's something that the client needs to be able to switch on and off
[07:53:14] <decx> do what you must
[07:59:09] <Zeranoe> decx: What could I use to remove the asterisk?  I have it working with an if ($('#ele').prop('checked')) {} right now. I want to add them if it is unchecked, and remove them if it is unchecked
[07:59:39] <Zeranoe> decx: Add if checked*
[08:05:18] <Zeranoe> decx: And what about .wrapInner for this
[08:05:38] <decx> this is all too heavy handed for some stylistic change
[08:05:56] <Zeranoe> decx: This isn't a style thing
[08:06:11] <decx> :before and :after on a class you can add to elements, ie7 get's bold text or something
[08:06:17] <decx> gets
[08:06:47] <Zeranoe> decx: Again, this is not a style thing. I need it to be an asterisk
[08:18:21] <YamakasY> hi guys
[08:19:16] <YamakasY> I'm doing some research for scripts which contain a large dropbox way or working where you only need to add your email-address  and you get an account... as dropbox is widely used and fileuploader to, I'm guessing in the witld I think
[08:29:43] <nedbat> I'm looking for something that might already exist, but is hard to google for.  I want to collect some preferences into a cookie, and then through my site, hide or show paragraphs based on those settings.  Anyone have a pointer to something like that?
[08:34:23] <Zeranoe> How come this isn't removing all the asterisks in the <td>s? http://jsbin.com/reyoyiwino/edit?html,js,console,output
[08:38:49] <Zeranoe> Got it http://jsbin.com/reyoyiwino/edit?html,js,console,output
[09:58:59] <joe0867> #jquery
[09:59:08] <joe0867> hello
[10:00:05] <joe0867> I just learned about this at a pluralsight presentation
[10:38:33] <taplar> so quiet, everyone start an early weekend? :D
[10:59:09] <jak2000> hi friends, how to update a value of a Session Variable? with jQuery?
[10:59:31] <taplar> session variable?
[11:02:02] <jak2000> yes
[11:02:34] <taplar> can you elaborate?  what are you referring to as a session variable
[11:07:28] <jak2000> something like that: http://php.net/manual/es/reserved.variables.session.php
[11:08:38] <taplar> if you want to change a back end session variable you'll have to do so through a(n) (ajax)request.  otherwise as far as the front end is concerned you have cookies or localStorage
[11:15:59] <jak2000> taplar thanks
[12:02:12] <earational> hey
[12:44:13] <guyz> {Q} i'm doing a simple jquery hover $("#whatever > li").hover... how do i not hover when the class of the li is "active" ?
[13:03:54] <NoiseEee> .not()
[13:04:02] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/not/
[13:04:20] <NoiseEee> $("#whatever > li").not('.active').hover presumably
[13:05:49] <z1haze> how can I get multiple scripts with  $.getScript('path/to/script').done(function() {
[15:23:02] <DanielCE> hey guys i notice that jquery click event takes abput 72ms which is way more then the 60fps limit for good smoothness, any ideas how to solve that issue or how can i overcome that ... really furstrating
[15:24:37] <jrockjiggz> DanielCE: could be your selector? use #id
[15:24:48] <DanielCE> hm im using selectors like that
[15:25:03] <jrockjiggz> share your code
[15:25:20] <DanielCE> main.on("click",".feeds_load",function...
[15:25:30] <DanielCE> cuz its live change
[15:25:45] <jrockjiggz> .class searches the whole DOM, which may part of the delay
[15:26:31] <DanielCE> ok let me try limit the feeds_load into on place specific and load it like that
[15:26:42] <DanielCE> please with few seconds
[15:26:44] <DanielCE> :)
[15:27:56] <jrockjiggz> I feel like you can try {'.feeds_load', '#parentDiv'} but i never tested it
[15:29:46] <DanielCE> hmmm i think u r right
[15:30:04] <DanielCE> i was trying to do it from contained div and it fly
[15:30:06] <DanielCE> hmm
[15:30:26] <DanielCE> so if i use ID its gonna be faster or what?
[15:30:45] <DanielCE> and what about leave th same just with better route?
[15:31:15] <DanielCE> like ("click",".page .footer .feeds_load"...
[15:33:30] <DanielCE> ".page .footer .feeds_load" < isnt helping
[15:34:29] <DanielCE> so how  exactly can i make it work fastr without put an ID?
