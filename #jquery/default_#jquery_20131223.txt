[00:17:26] <vinex08> if (window.innerWidth >= 768 )  {    <--  still executes the jQueries even im on 768px viewport
[00:18:54] <WiZaRDuSS> that only works if the site is loaded on that size..
[00:19:34] <WiZaRDuSS> some people Ive seen tried that by resizeing the window
[00:19:51] <WiZaRDuSS> ive noticed it wont be updated properly sometimes
[00:28:46] <vinex08> so what's the alternative solution?
[00:29:27] <vinex08> oh yeah it does work when you load it on that size
[00:30:00] <WiZaRDuSS> hmm
[00:30:46] <WiZaRDuSS> oh lol.. just remembered
[00:30:52] <WiZaRDuSS> innerwidth doesnt work on document or window
[00:30:54] <WiZaRDuSS> just on elements
[00:30:58] <WiZaRDuSS> window only has width
[00:31:09] <WiZaRDuSS> as there is no difference between the 2
[00:31:19] <WiZaRDuSS> innerwidth looks at the width of elements with padding applied
[00:32:00] <fabioportieri> o/
[00:38:13] <WiZaRDuSS> vinex08: you need to use window width

[02:06:58] <RabSimpson> hi folks, i'm suffering some embarrassing woes with a toggle script. i've been up for 20 hours and had no caffeine. that's my excuse and i'm sticking to it. here's my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/3T3FG/ could someone point me in the right direction so i can go get some sleep? much appreciated.
[02:08:48] <RabSimpson> it works (mostly) within the actual page its on, with the exception of the .html part. no idea why it doesn't do anything on the fiddle.
[02:09:29] <Lope> if I want to validate the datatypes of an array, can I just validate the datatype of the first element and then assume the rest are the same? (assuming $.isArray===true)
[02:55:36] <MagePsycho> any better jquery overlay out there? need to show some image, video & custom html form in overlay
[02:58:32] <krambiorix> hi, how can i add the draggable event to all future created divs with class "account" ?
[03:00:04] <fabioportieri> with .delegate()
[03:00:11] <fabioportieri> or .on() in the delegate form
[03:09:50] <morfin> hello
[03:11:32] <morfin> anybody can tell me is that better way to use string methods in my plugin? like $("#element").Filter("dosomething",arg1,...);?
[03:11:38] <morfin> *best way
[03:16:12] <krambiorix> fabioportieri, thanks!! with draggables i work with a helper... How can i set the width of the original draggable and not the helper on start drag?
[03:19:38] <shoky> krambiorix: $(this)
[03:20:40] <Zuige> hello ! anyone available to help with a simple hack to the jquery ui tabs widget?
[03:21:16] <Zuige> i want to have the tabs widget be a toggle content widget instead of current functionality
[03:21:43] <Zuige> so that you can toggle as many tabs to be visible at the same time as you wish
[03:21:53] <Zuige> any ideas?
[03:24:52] <Zuige> nevermind, i figured it out :)
[03:27:01] <bigbugjava> Question, I'm uploading to amazon s3, for now it works with one file, I want to add Jquery UI progress and such, now should I use npm install "npm install blueimp-file-upload-node" or use on client side?
[03:36:04] <krambiorix> shoky, thanks!
[03:36:31] <krambiorix> how can i limit scrolling a draggable to only vertical?
[03:38:30] <Aquaword> anyone, why keydown first moves the page a bit then do it's job?
[03:41:25] <fabioportieri> Aquaword: scrollbar disappearing?
[03:41:58] <fabioportieri> i have this issue when i use an overlay div.. it make scrollbar disappears and content shift.. how do i solve it mm
[03:42:19] <Aquaword> hm
[03:43:18] <Aquaword> no, the page "quake" a bit like in a millisec
[03:46:08] <bigbugjava> Anyone can explain a bit about Jquery multi upload UI, the thing is, that when I click upload, I dont really send an object or file, I req it from node.js, so I dont understand how to display progress and let user choose like in the plugin
[03:50:29] <Aquaword> ok solved
[03:50:53] <Aquaword> e.preventDefault() needed in the keydown function
[04:23:36] <jomofcw> Hello ! I would like to do something (adding some style for example) each time an element having the class "myClass" is added to the DOM... how can I do that please ?
[04:25:00] <fabioportieri> jomofcw: with plain css ?
[04:25:47] <jomofcw> Style is just and example... probably a bad example. In fact I would like to init a CKEditor each time I add dynamicaly a textarea having the class 'richText'.
[04:25:57] <jomofcw> And hello fabioportieri xD sorry.
[04:27:48] <fabioportieri> jomofcw: maybe a delegate() on ready event will do the trick
[04:34:02] <jomofcw> I can bind the ready stats of an element other than the doc ?
[04:34:42] <fabioportieri> jomofcw: $('body').delegate('.textareaClass', 'ready', function() {
[04:34:44] <jomofcw> The doc seems to answer "no" :/.
[04:34:55] <fabioportieri> oh, really?
[04:35:03] <jomofcw> I tried and we will see.
[04:37:07] <jomofcw> It seems it doesn't work :/
[04:37:49] <fabioportieri> yeah sorry
[04:37:59] <fabioportieri> i was mistaken with that advice
[04:39:06] <fabioportieri> do you have ajax calls?
[04:39:22] <chrisalexthomas> hi, I'd like to know, is it possible to manually trigger a promises error function returned from $.post ?
[04:39:57] <chrisalexthomas> I retain a variable to the promise object, but I want to trigger that the callbacks I passed to the promise.error(fn) function, will trigger
[04:40:01] <fabioportieri> jomofcw: you can check this solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12936437/delegate-a-ready-event-in-jquery
[04:40:30] <chrisalexthomas> cause what I have is that my ajax call is succeeding, but having invalid data, in this case, I Want to trigger the error function when an ajax errors out, or an error function when the ajax returns successfully, but with invalid data
[04:42:28] <jomofcw> fabioportieri OK, I'll give it a lokk ^^. Thanks for your help =).
[04:43:53] <fabioportieri> you're welcome

[06:07:11] <Hilton> When using the following as the success function of a $.ajax() call: $(this).closest('tr').before(result['html']); ... how can I animate the insertion?
[06:16:00] <ogeday> hey
[06:21:05] <bigbugjava> https://gist.github.com/webwedding/8097565
[06:21:22] <bigbugjava> The issue is I dont know how to add JQUERY file uploader UI in there
[06:21:26] <bigbugjava> cant figure how
[06:21:49] <bigbugjava> I dont understand https://gist.github.com/webwedding/809756
[06:21:53] <bigbugjava> sry
[06:21:59] <bigbugjava> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[06:23:51] <Asmooh> git gives an error
[06:24:09] <Asmooh> i dunno what u try to do, but file upload just do xhr request
[06:24:29] <Asmooh> for ui, well that is a different thing
[06:24:39] <Asmooh> convert to base64 or so works fine
[06:24:55] <Asmooh> from a canvas or fileinput
[06:25:30] <bigbugjava> Asmooh HA?
[06:25:59] <Asmooh> oh
[06:26:00] <Asmooh> nodejs
[06:26:18] <Asmooh> lemme check
[06:26:35] <Asmooh> what part dont you get?
[06:26:36] <bigbugjava> try this https://gist.github.com/webwedding/8097565
[06:26:52] <Jagst3r15> any idea why I am getting Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Object] is not a function for  http://hastebin.com/wixixecara.js
[06:27:33] <bigbugjava> Jagst3r15 Check your selectors
[06:27:40] <Asmooh> i dont know much about nodejs i only use it for notifications in my app :)
[06:27:50] <bigbugjava> Asmooh I see
[06:27:53] <Asmooh> i do file uploads with xhr
[06:28:08] <bigbugjava> and u use jquery file upload?
[06:28:20] <Asmooh> no something i build myself
[06:28:30] <Asmooh> its in an app, not a website
[06:28:53] <Jagst3r15> im not sure what you mean
[06:29:05] <Jagst3r15> when I try to use jshint to debug it says the code is perfectly valid
[06:30:11] <bigbugjava> Jagst3r15 I'm not sure what I mean aswell, lol, but I whould check selectors on that case, you're may be not getting the right property because selector doesn't exists
[06:31:43] <Asmooh> bigbugjava, this is what i do (pictures)  .. step 1, user clicks on the document + picture icon: https://www.dropbox.com/s/vlwn46m013ep5id/IMG_20131265.png  than step 2. user choose a dashed part to select: https://www.dropbox.com/s/2or6rdk58o690nn/IMG_20131246.png   step 3, it uploads the picture and cuts out the dashed part from the picture, than the user can rotate the picture (dont have sceenshot of this)
[06:31:56] <Asmooh> loading indicator included :)
[06:32:25] <Asmooh> sends it as base64
[06:36:56] <bigbugjava> Asmoosh
[06:37:01] <bigbugjava> very nice
[06:37:04] <bigbugjava> looking great
[06:37:21] <Asmooh> isnt that hard to build :)
[06:39:30] <bigbugjava> Asmooh as you can see my issue is different
[06:39:57] <Asmooh> i dont 100% get your issue :) you try to add a uploader ? right
[06:40:15] <bigbugjava> all the prob is that my javascript code does nothing, so node.js simply get the form file by request, so it has no middlemans
[06:40:50] <bigbugjava> and what I want is the get an uploader, that will run my post request one by one
[06:41:02] <Asmooh> hmm
[06:43:33] <s3d_matt> afternoon all
[06:44:49] <s3d_matt> I'm loading a modal by .ajax, which has a form on it,  The form has elements like .datepicker.   I have incline <scripts> in the returned json data, which appear to be firing (by testing with an alert) but the date picker is not firing, any ideas?
[06:47:54] <s3d_matt> ?
[06:48:01] <redondo> sorry, is this the place to ask about jqplot?
[06:48:23] <Asmooh> s3d_matt, please explain again
[06:49:02] <s3d_matt> Asmooh: Im loading a form into a modal in query.  The form elements use query features, e.g. Datepicker.
[06:49:04] <Asmooh> you want to set the datepicker value with json data?
[06:49:57] <s3d_matt> Asmooh: So, when i return the modal's content html, it has <script>abc 123</script> in it, e.g. $( '#titlesafrefdarea52b84d810ebeb' ).datepicker() etc
[06:50:10] <Asmooh> hm
[06:50:35] <s3d_matt> the inline script seems to be being firing, as an alert is firing, even tho I've not called eval on it
[06:50:44] <Asmooh> that i dont know, seems like a really long and strange way around something simple
[06:50:45] <Asmooh> :)
[06:50:53] <s3d_matt> Asmooh: how would you go about it?
[06:51:47] <redondo> If so, I have problems showing the legent of a line plot. I'm doing it like this: http://pastie.org/8571440
[06:51:57] <Asmooh> it really depends on exactly what you want, putting values, showing or hiding, because you want to set an jquery id what i understand, that id is always there or need to be added when the json data is received
[06:52:16] <s3d_matt> Asmooh: its about re-bing a element post load
[06:52:22] <Asmooh> ah
[06:52:35] <s3d_matt> e.g. the form element 'startDate' was introduced to the dom when the modal loaded
[06:53:40] <s3d_matt> so I'm trying to bind the new query elements so they work in the modal
[06:53:50] <s3d_matt> (or dialog windows, whatever people call em)
[06:54:21] <Asmooh> hmm good question
[06:54:41] <Asmooh> because i can add and change things but thats not jquery
[06:54:50] <Asmooh> manupilate the dom or whatever its called
[06:56:34] <s3d_matt> yeah
[06:57:15] <Asmooh> but i dunno how to do with normal jquery
[06:58:32] <s3d_matt> some things are re-binding, some appear not to be
[06:58:49] <Asmooh> hmm do you have somewhere the same ID
[06:58:56] <Asmooh> id¥s as example css_
[06:59:01] <Asmooh> damn i hate this keyboard
[06:59:10] <Asmooh> sometimes that can give issues
[07:00:21] <s3d_matt> def no same IDs
[07:00:27] <s3d_matt> as they are timestamped
[07:00:31] <Asmooh> hmm
[07:12:06] <alexfu> is there a way to remove callbacks from a jquery function?
[07:12:25] <alexfu> i.e, the hover function
[07:14:40] <s3d_matt> Asmooh: changed it a little, using .on (e.g. $(document).on('click', 'input',function(){ $(this).datepicker(); });) but it only works on the second focus, so clearly need to rebind it somehow
[07:14:49] <dblosevn> alexfu: $(selector).off('hover')
[07:15:00] <Asmooh> hmmz
[07:15:25] <dblosevn> `api off @ alexfu
[07:15:25] <b-ot> alexfu: .off(): Remove an event handler. http://api.jquery.com/off/
[07:15:31] <alexfu> dblosevn, thanks
[07:15:48] <dblosevn> :-)
[07:26:48] <s3d_matt> another easier question i hope
[07:26:56] <s3d_matt> in the success function of .ajx
[07:27:12] <s3d_matt> I have a json which has returned 'data'
[07:27:31] <s3d_matt> in data.javascript is a load of javascript which i want to run - how do i do that
[07:27:39] <s3d_matt> eval(data.javascript); ?
[07:29:17] <dblosevn> s3d_matt: unfortunately thats about the only way to do that, I usually include scripts in my markup returned from the server to avoid the use of eval when its required.
[07:29:42] <s3d_matt> well its just stuff to rebind form elements
[07:29:53] <dblosevn> always the same?
[07:29:56] <s3d_matt> e.g. $(.someFormElementClass).datepicker();
[07:30:02] <s3d_matt> not always the same tho
[07:30:32] <dblosevn> you returning prerendered html to inject somewhere was well?
[07:30:38] <s3d_matt> yes
[07:30:57] <dblosevn> Id include a ready block in the prerendered html with your init code
[07:31:12] <s3d_matt> dblosevn: http://pastebin.com/fv81HurX
[07:31:44] <s3d_matt> thats the ajax function (which is created in PHP)
[07:32:05] <s3d_matt> (the find script bit is to be delveted)
[07:32:43] <dblosevn> s3d_matt: lines 25-27 are not really required, and actually cause your scripts to be executed twice. jquery will exxecute the scripts in data.content by it self
[07:33:06] <s3d_matt> yeah, sorry meant to deltet them
[07:33:16] <dblosevn> well technically not jquery, javascript will
[07:33:17] <s3d_matt> do you see any major issues  / bad design with that approach
[07:34:11] <dblosevn> No I use a method quite like that in a huge enterprise app, the js required is completely different for every request so I include the js inline with the content wrapped in a ready event
[07:34:21] <s3d_matt> dblosevn: updfated: http://pastebin.com/tR1Krsba
[07:34:53] <s3d_matt> so that should still be a :  eval(DOC READY { javascript..... } );
[07:35:44] <dblosevn> s3d_matt: I think your still missing it, I wouldnt eval anything, simply include a script block in data.content with a dom ready wrapper and put your code inline there
[07:35:55] <s3d_matt> ahhh right
[07:36:13] <s3d_matt> i think i tried that and the date picker would not re-bind
[07:36:31] <s3d_matt> but ill retry it now
[07:36:36] <dblosevn> It does work, its just a little harder to debug when it doesnt
[07:36:46] <s3d_matt> i ssue is must be in a doc ready
[07:36:49] <s3d_matt> assume*
[07:36:57] <dblosevn> yes must be
[07:39:39] <s3d_matt> dblosevn: http://pastebin.com/tPYr7Jgx - tried but does not fire
[07:40:17] <dblosevn> s3d_matt: heres an example of a screen response in the app I built http://pastebin.ca/2517283
[07:41:05] <s3d_matt> dblosevn:  interesting no doc ready tehre
[07:41:17] <dblosevn> sorry I dont think that worke
[07:41:44] <dblosevn> its an IIFE
[07:42:07] <s3d_matt> IIFE, ??
[07:42:11] <s3d_matt> omg, I'm such a twat
[07:42:17] <s3d_matt> the bloody form element didn't have the id set
[07:42:22] <s3d_matt> what a tw-at i am

[07:44:56] <zyphz> Hello all, I have a little problem, when i use ajax to load a xml file it tells me something about No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access
[07:45:02] <zyphz> Anybody know about that?
[07:46:47] <dblosevn> zyphz: thats awkward usually it would show the orgin. Where is this xml feed at? is it local to the server thats serving the page your script is running on. Or is the page your testing not being served by a server orgin would be null if the page was served by the file:/// protocal
[07:47:02] <s3d_matt> dblosevn: good code is over rated :P
[07:47:23] <zyphz> its the file:/// protocol
[07:47:32] <zyphz> I wondered if that was possible
[07:47:35] <dblosevn> xhr is not supported on file://
[07:47:47] <zyphz> Thanks man :)
[07:47:54] <dblosevn> unless its phonegap/cordova :-)
[07:48:17] <zyphz> Is there other ways to load xml files content in file:/// ?
[07:48:48] <dblosevn> no because xhr doesnt work
[07:48:55] <zyphz> And xhr is the only way?
[07:49:44] <dblosevn> `g xhr @ zyphz
[07:49:45] <b-ot> zyphz: Sorry, no results for ‚Äüxhr @ zyphz‚Äù.
[07:50:03] <dblosevn> zyphz: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest
[07:50:07] <zyphz> Okay thanks again ;)
[07:50:31] <dblosevn> Thats the only method to pull an external request with javascript
[07:51:23] <dblosevn> theres lots of cool wrappers in librarys like jquery around it but at the base they all use xhr to pull the request behind the scenes
[07:51:39] <zyphz> Yea thats what i figured out
[07:52:35] <dblosevn> the only other option would be to wrap a request in an iframe, but... then you would have cross orgin problems trying to get the content of the iframe being the iframes orgin would be http://domain and the parents orgin would be file://null
[07:53:25] <zyphz> I see, I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible, so I will just put it on my server
[08:00:37] <karstenk1977_> hello, i get with ajax a well formed jsonObject but success or complete isnt fired, how can i debug that?
[08:03:04] <dblosevn> karnowski_: .error(function(e) { console.log(e) })
[08:04:17] <dblosevn> and also check the network tab to ensure the request is being fired at all

[08:14:56] <bigbugjava> Killing me softly (J-query upload)
[08:38:13] <speaker123> hey all...i've done a selection:   var myelement = $('#blah');
[08:38:37] <speaker123> now i need to select the nth child from myelement.  the point is that i don't have access to #blah, only myelement...its a parameter to a function.
[08:39:04] <speaker123> how do i do this...i know about :nth-child, but this seems to require that you append it to the str selector
[08:39:37] <joroci> you don't have access?
[08:42:18] <karstenk1977_> i cannot dump in success of jQuery.Ajax, is that correct?
[08:42:51] <karstenk1977_> console.log('Foo'); gives no output
[08:45:25] <speaker123> joroci, all i have is element
[08:45:30] <speaker123> it was passed to me via a functin
[08:45:55] <speaker123> is it possible to construct a string from element which would select the same element?
[08:46:29] <karstenk1977_> plz can you search at this site for ZIP "DE45145" and tell me, why I get no success event of jQuery.Ajax? the jsonObject that returns looks fine!
[08:46:32] <karstenk1977_> http://solarinvert.tom-develop.com/dealer/locator/search
[08:47:03] <joroci> maybe if you give id
[08:47:05] <joroci> or a class
[08:47:33] <joroci> but if you get an element you can pass the element
[08:48:32] <speaker123> but i have no idea what was typed:   call_to_func( $('some crazy selector') )
[08:48:41] <speaker123> call_to_func needs to grab the nth child
[08:49:05] <karstenk1977_> http://jsonlint.com/ tells me that it is a valid json
[08:49:46] <joroci> you loop through this  $('some crazy selector')  element?
[08:50:51] <speaker123> ahh..maybe filter() is what i need?
[08:51:23] <speaker123> element.filter(':nth-child(3)')
[08:52:41] <joroci> that can work
[08:57:39] <Jagst3r15> ok i cant figure this out...Any idea why I see Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Object] is not a function for  http://hastebin.com/wixixecara.js  ?
[08:59:49] <joroci> did you load jquery?
[09:00:40] <Jagst3r15> yes sir
[09:00:42] <Jagst3r15> or madam
[09:01:12] <joroci> do you have the full code?
[09:01:13] <Jagst3r15> i am utterly puzzled
[09:01:22] <Jagst3r15> that is all the code xD
[09:01:25] <joroci> it should work
[09:01:39] <joroci> i mean no errors
[09:01:44] <zecho> you're not using multiple libraries, either?
[09:01:50] <Jagst3r15> chrome dev tools is throwing an error t me
[09:01:54] <Jagst3r15> nope just jquery
[09:03:18] <joroci> how did you load jquery?
[09:03:30] <joroci> $
[09:03:33] <joroci> alone is working in dev tools?
[09:03:50] <Jagst3r15> im using wordpress
[09:03:53] <Jagst3r15> its auto loaded
[09:04:10] <Jagst3r15> i have a development link if u want to see
[09:04:26] <joroci> try typing
[09:04:28] <joroci> $
[09:04:29] <joroci> in the console
[09:04:57] <Jagst3r15> it says undefined :O
[09:05:11] <zecho> jquery isn't loaded, then.
[09:05:32] <joroci> yep
[09:05:56] <zecho> let's see your markup, if we may.
[09:06:15] <joroci> i hate wordpress
[09:06:31] <Jagst3r15> shit
[09:06:41] <Jagst3r15> I needed this before it
[09:06:42] <Jagst3r15> jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[09:06:54] <Jagst3r15> then another });
[09:07:10] <Jagst3r15> that does it
[09:07:29] <joroci> got another library using 4?
[09:07:33] <joroci> $?
[09:07:50] <zecho> or his code ran before the library was loaded.
[09:08:05] <Jagst3r15> wordpress u have to use jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[09:08:25] <joroci> oh well
[09:08:49] <zecho> ah. because WP uses multiple libraries.
[09:09:01] <zecho> makes sense. I hate WP with a fiery passion.
[09:09:04] <joroci> yea
[09:09:32] <joroci> but i guess every lib doesn't expose $
[09:09:38] <joroci> because $ is undefined
[09:10:11] <joroci> but really i like joomla better
[09:10:19] <joroci> much more friendly
[09:10:37] <zecho> no, wordpress calls noConflict explicitly
[09:11:01] <joroci> oh
[09:11:24] <joroci> i'll stick to normal web development
[09:11:50] <joroci> wasting my time with IE
[09:12:57] <joroci> zecho do you use native js too?
[09:14:17] <zecho> It depends greatly on the project. Most everything I do on the frontend is somehow tied to twitter Bootstrap, though, so it tends to make more sense to write jQuery.
[09:14:57] <joroci> did you ever used a while loop?
[09:15:46] <zecho> occasionally, I suppose.
[09:16:02] <joroci> what do you think about
[09:16:07] <joroci> var interval = setInterval(function(){ if(something) {doSomthing(); clearInterval(interval); }  },25);
[09:16:08] <joroci> ?
[09:18:36] <zecho> How much IE do you need to support?
[09:18:49] <joroci> 9+
[09:20:19] <zecho> well, my first thought is that you could run into callback issues, the next one is an issue where your interval finishes before your logic can finish
[09:20:51] <zecho> men has some strategies for dealing with both.
[09:20:58] <zecho> autocorrect. ugh.
[09:21:01] <zecho> mdn.
[09:21:06] <zecho> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.setInterval
[09:23:35] <joroci> hm let's assume i don't need a callback
[09:23:50] <joroci> it's just sending something like an event trigger
[09:24:03] <joroci> to another anonymous function
[09:25:22] <joroci> gtg got to my stop :)
[09:38:19] <Hilton> Anybody here familiar with Bootstrap?
[09:38:25] <Hilton> 2
[09:38:50] <Kamuela> #javascript: Redundant? :)
[09:39:20] <Hilton> Or know a jQuery equivalent to Affix?
[09:44:34] <bigbugjava> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'parseMetaData' of undefined, On jquery uploader
[09:44:37] <bigbugjava> anyone has idea?
[10:06:35] <karstenk1977_> plz you jquery experts, plz tell me, why the first GET request of this site http://solarinvert.tom-develop.com/dealer/locator/search is as suspected json and the second request for your search for "DE45145" is wroonngly other!
[10:06:55] <karstenk1977_> its from the same script
[10:07:02] <karstenk1977_> no cross server
[10:17:04] <s3d_matt> Hi All, back with another wee ajax question
[10:17:38] <s3d_matt> http://pastebin.com/hU1mq6nY
[10:20:31] <s3d_matt> I'm expecting that the loaded form, which the submit button has the code of: <button class="btn btn-info" type="submit" id="modal_submit"><i class="icon-ok"></i> Submit</button> to hit the ajax request, but is doesn't, and just does a normal post
[10:23:34] <s3d_matt> anyone?
[10:23:55] <platzhirsch> If I want to implement pagination where the content is already on the page, should I implement that myself or is there already an obvious plugin?
[10:25:23] <s3d_matt> platzhirsch: more of a framework questions, like code igniter etc
[10:25:38] <s3d_matt> would you do pagination in query?
[10:25:42] <s3d_matt> j
[10:26:15] <platzhirsch> s3d_matt: I don't mean pagination in a sense of querying the rest of the content from the server
[10:26:19] <bigbugjava> I need someone with MAJOR experince in jQuery-File-Upload-9.5.2,  Because I'M ABOUT TO FREAK OUT!
[10:26:24] <s3d_matt> platzhirsch: jez man, a simple google has brought up like a stack of stuff
[10:26:41] <platzhirsch> Didn't found that very useful
[10:27:33] <s3d_matt> bigbugjava: i have just implemented it in my site
[10:27:34] <s3d_matt> whats up
[10:27:40] <platzhirsch> I just want to utilize the pagination elements of Bootstrap
[10:28:14] <Uhkis> s3d_matt: not 100% sure but that second .ready() seems pretty pointless (line #45)
[10:28:32] <s3d_matt> platzhirsch: pagination is just about how you query your db and gather those results!!! Bootstrap is just your presenation
[10:29:08] <s3d_matt> Uhkis: yes, i guess it would be
[10:29:47] <s3d_matt> Uhkis: remove, but still fires straight through
[10:29:53] <s3d_matt> *removed
[10:30:07] <Uhkis> s3d_matt: have you check that the new on submit is even called? (do an alert there or something)
[10:30:13] <Uhkis> checked*
[10:30:21] <s3d_matt> there is an apart, and no it is not called at all
[10:30:24] <s3d_matt> alert*
[10:30:52] <platzhirsch> s3d_matt: Exactly, I am talking about the presentation part, all my content is delivered at once, but I want to use the pagination to divide the view
[10:30:56] <fabioportieri> time to go.. bye
[10:31:18] <s3d_matt> platzhirsch: do you want all the results in the dom, and then show/hide from there?
[10:31:26] <Uhkis> platzhirsch: http://plugins.jquery.com/bootstrap-paginator/ ?
[10:31:32] <platzhirsch> s3d_matt: that was my intention
[10:32:07] <bigbugjava> s3d_matt I cant implement it!!!
[10:32:11] <bigbugjava> lol
[10:32:18] <bigbugjava> trying to 6-7 hours now
[10:32:19] <bigbugjava> nothing
[10:32:27] <bigbugjava> just a whole bunch of messy work
[10:32:32] <s3d_matt> bigbugjava: yeah it is a sod to setup, what are you getting, anything/
[10:32:35] <s3d_matt> ?
[10:33:13] <bigbugjava> s3d_matt If I use the basic, I do manage to multipie uploads to amazon s3 trough Node.js.
[10:33:27] <s3d_matt> thats a start...
[10:33:32] <bigbugjava> anything eles, but anything eles, seems to break
[10:33:39] <bigbugjava> actually all I want is Basic-plus
[10:33:40] <bigbugjava> will do for me
[10:33:53] <bigbugjava> but I cant manage to make the add files even work, they dont show up
[10:33:53] <bigbugjava> nada
[10:33:54] <s3d_matt> Uhkis: can you see any reason why it would not get caught in the query capture?
[10:34:07] <Uhkis> s3d_matt: is that div actually returned on the first call?
[10:34:14] <s3d_matt> bigbugjava: by show up, you mean in the file system?
[10:34:30] <bigbugjava> s3d_matt I select files, and none show
[10:34:31] <bigbugjava> no show
[10:34:33] <bigbugjava> on nothing
[10:34:47] <s3d_matt> Uhkis: div?
[10:34:55] <bigbugjava> it should present the files, then upload one by one
[10:35:09] <s3d_matt> bigbugjava: hmmm let me look at my code
[10:35:18] <bigbugjava> okay!
[10:35:26] <bigbugjava> you add the complete package? or just took what you wanted?
[10:35:30] <Uhkis> s3d_matt: well, any element with id "modal_submit" :-)
[10:35:45] <s3d_matt> yeah, the button defiantly has it: (cut and paste coming:
[10:36:07] <s3d_matt> <button class="btn btn-info" type="submit" id="modal_submit"><i class="icon-ok"></i> Submit</button>
[10:36:11] <Uhkis> (i'm too used to manipulating divs :))
[10:36:22] <bigbugjava> I'm deleting what I have, so I can retry
[10:36:28] <s3d_matt> bigbugjava: ok
[10:36:45] <s3d_matt> bigbugjava: talking of divs, sure you have got the DIV for that to populate in
[10:37:01] <Uhkis> s3d_matt: and does $('#modal_submit') return a jquery object?
[10:37:40] <bigbugjava> s3d_matt I copy complete html, so It cant miss the div I guess
[10:37:44] <s3d_matt> Uhkis: no idea, #model_submit is a (type submit) button, which when pressed i want to do an AJAX, rather than normal post
[10:38:18] <Uhkis> s3d_matt: console.log or alert it?
[10:38:32] <s3d_matt> yeah, already done, but it doesn't fire
[10:38:59] <Uhkis> just plain console.log($('#modal_submit')); ?
[10:39:19] <s3d_matt> line 49
[10:39:31] <s3d_matt> Uhkis: where would i do that?
[10:39:37] <s3d_matt> "just plain console.log($('#modal_submit')); ?"
[10:39:39] <Uhkis> s3d_matt: before the .on() stuff
[10:39:43] <s3d_matt> k
[10:40:37] <s3d_matt> Uhkis: [button#modal_submit.btn.btn-info, context: document, selector: "#modal_submit", jquery: "2.0.3", constructor: function, init: function‚Ä¶]
[10:41:39] <Uhkis> s3d_matt: have you tried .submit() instead of .on() ?
[10:41:47] <s3d_matt> yep, no effect
[10:42:23] <Uhkis> .click? :D
[10:42:36] <bigbugjava> s3d_matt mate?
[10:43:15] <s3d_matt> i can't find anything which changes from basic to bail plus of any note
[10:43:19] <s3d_matt> other than the image engine
[10:43:23] <s3d_matt> which i think it must be
[10:44:08] <s3d_matt> Uhkis: CLICK fired the alert
[10:44:57] <s3d_matt> will click work for enter press"?
[10:45:04] <bigbugjava> how did you implemnted it?
[10:45:17] <bigbugjava> just took the html changed the url and thats it?
[10:45:53] <Uhkis> s3d_matt: i think not, but you could do keybind for it..
[10:45:53] <s3d_matt> i reckon its the image engine, which i don't use
[10:46:02] <bigbugjava> u use basic only?
[10:46:08] <s3d_matt> if that fails, i would imagine it would fail
[10:46:11] <s3d_matt> i currently use basic
[10:46:13] <s3d_matt> ui
[10:46:20] <bigbugjava> I see
[10:46:42] <bigbugjava> this one diplay none to me aswell, but he does send images to server
[10:46:44] <s3d_matt> bigbugjava:  assume your using bootstrap :P
[10:46:45] <bigbugjava> dispkay
[10:46:50] <bigbugjava> yeah
[10:47:14] <Asterfield> Does anyone have any experience with the select2 plugin?
[10:47:53] <s3d_matt> Asterfield: literally just been using that
[10:48:08] <s3d_matt> bigbugjava: assume you have checked you have the other 3 js scripts in there
[10:48:12] <s3d_matt> image, video and one other
[10:48:20] <s3d_matt> (I think)
[10:48:33] <bigbugjava> yeah?
[10:49:24] <Asterfield> s3d_matt: Do you know of a way to load options data via ajax at load time, then never again?
[10:49:44] <bigbugjava> I see now  done: function (e, data) { function
[10:49:46] <bigbugjava> doesn't work
[10:50:14] <s3d_matt> Asterfield: I load all mine at load time via php
[10:50:31] <Asterfield> meh I was afraid of that
[10:50:33] <s3d_matt> but the principle should be the same for Ajax, load in all the options to html and update the dom
[10:50:39] <s3d_matt> and then re-bond
[10:50:42] <s3d_matt> re-bind
[10:51:11] <Asterfield> I feel like the select2 docs is just good enough to look professional, but not good enough to actually explain how the thing works
[10:51:56] <bigbugjava> s3d_matt urg, will be happy if u have some exmaple to share, if you cant it's okay!
[10:52:29] <s3d_matt> imjust looking through it now, i have reverted to the basic
[10:52:35] <s3d_matt> as iddnt want the pictures etc
[10:52:42] <s3d_matt> so its what you already have really
[10:54:57] <bigbugjava> ok, thx man!
[10:56:02] <Asterfield> s3d_matt: I ended up loading via php, thanks for the help man :)
[11:26:02] <teufelChiCoder> this might be off topic question , a few months ago i came across a travel website, it was for European locations - user would choose what he/she felt like visiting or what mood they wanted to go to  and site would show them different locations based on their preferences, it was part of like a website of a day or soemthing like that, does anyone have an idea of a site like that?
[11:26:12] <hypercool_> how to send data to a php file using jquery
[11:30:49] <BillCriswell> hypercool_: $.post(), $.ajax(), $.get()... take your pick.
[12:10:13] <Whirl3d> hey all. Could someone tell me why this fiddle is messing up? http://jsfiddle.net/p499h/806/
[12:11:04] <Whirl3d> I expected it to add a class to the "fieldGroup" class based on the label, then use CSS to only show the appropriate inputs based on matching classes.
[12:13:32] <shoky> Whirl3d removeClass needs spaces not commas. and check the console log
[12:16:06] <shoky> oops scratch the last part
[12:16:40] <Whirl3d> lol. I did check the console log. I can't believe I missed that. Thanks.
[12:17:30] <shoky> ya, i was clicking on the labels to the left of the inputs at first
[12:26:54] <Ansikt> if I have a dom structure which looks like:
[12:27:14] <Ansikt> div class="parent"
[12:27:21] <zumba_addict> hey folks, I'd like to refer to it using value="Done" and class="continue-link", how do I write it? <input type="submit" value="Done" name="nav-button" class="continue-link">
[12:27:36] <Ansikt>  |-> div class="child"
[12:27:40] <Ansikt>  |-> div class="child"
[12:27:41] <Ansikt>  |-> div class="child"
[12:28:27] <zumba_addict> $(':input [value=Done][class=continue-link]') is this correct?
[12:29:27] <zumba_addict> it worked but without space
[13:07:17] <gtek1k> anyone have experienve validating SSN ?
[13:08:35] <jphase> gtek1k: yeah, you can sign up for an API service through ssa.gov
[13:09:05] <gtek1k> you have done that?
[13:09:12] <jphase> er, maybe it's ssnvalidator.com actually
[13:09:22] <jphase> it was awhile ago, but yes I've done it before
[13:10:10] <jphase> there's a few different API services out there, some are paid and some are "consent based validation" or something
[13:14:33] <gtek1k> thanks for this jphase
[13:14:42] <jphase> sure thing
[13:14:42] <gtek1k> I assume the implementation was fairly simple ?
[13:15:22] <jphase> as simple as any other API. I can't remember if it was xml or json based, but should be pretty straight forward
[13:15:46] <gtek1k> if I wanted help implementing it, might you be available?
[13:16:26] <jphase> I'm online often, if you need help just let me know
[13:21:08] <gtek1k> well I would hire you to help dont like asking for free help
[13:23:41] <jphase> gtek1k: I don't mind helping if it doesn't take too much time. What server-side language are you working in?
[13:23:48] <gtek1k> PHP
[13:23:52] <jphase> yeah, np
[13:25:25] <mvpgraff> Anybody use the validation plugin?
[13:25:38] <jphase> mvpgraff: yep
[13:26:11] <mvpgraff> I'm having an issue where the error class is being called inside a group of inputs instead of the outside
[13:27:11] <mvpgraff> From the looks of it, jsfiddle doesn't have the validation plugin in the library field
[13:27:35] <jphase> mvpgraff: you can add an external library to jsfiddle
[13:27:44] <mvpgraff> Oh eya
[13:27:47] <mvpgraff> Kk give me a sex
[13:27:49] <mvpgraff> sec*
[13:27:51] <jphase> lol
[13:27:54] * jphase sexes mvpgraff
[13:28:00] <mvpgraff> lmao
[13:34:30] <mvpgraff> jphase
[13:34:35] <jphase> sup?
[13:34:37] <mvpgraff> yup, can't do it on jsfiddle
[13:34:55] <mvpgraff> just gave me a ton of errors from shell
[13:34:56] <mvpgraff> lol
[13:34:59] <jphase> doh! have a public link?
[13:35:08] <mvpgraff> nope on local . _ .
[13:35:24] <mvpgraff> anyways, I'll draw it out xD
[13:35:50] <mvpgraff> [] = input
[13:35:51] <mvpgraff> Phone - [] <error> [] []
[13:36:10] <mvpgraff> That's what it looks like, even though I grouped the three inputs in the validation :(
[13:36:32] <Acrack> hello
[13:36:38] <mvpgraff> http://jsfiddle.net/7QxhV/
[13:36:41] <mvpgraff> is pretty much the code
[13:36:57] <Acrack> when i do var foo = bar; does bar equals foo also ?
[13:37:34] <mvpgraff> Oh wait
[13:37:36] <mvpgraff> it works
[13:37:53] <mvpgraff> http://jsfiddle.net/7QxhV/1/ - jphase
[13:38:09] <mvpgraff> I labeled it wrong in fiddle which kept giving me a shell error lol
[13:38:16] <jphase> sec, on a quick conference call
[13:38:19] <mvpgraff> Kk
[13:40:13] <Acrack> can someone explain me a basic jquery thingy please ? http://jsfiddle.net/3SLSD/
[13:40:29] <Acrack> i don't understand why a variable does it keep its value here
[13:40:39] <Acrack> (its 5 lines of code)
[13:40:52] <Acrack> doesn't*
[13:41:31] <mvpgraff> Acrack, what is the logic of this? gameIds = storedGameIds;
[13:41:48] <Acrack> hum gameIds is changing when i do some things
[13:41:53] <Acrack> but when i press a buton
[13:42:03] <Acrack> i want it to return like storedGameIds
[13:42:14] <Acrack> but it doesn't return to origin state :s
[13:43:03] <mvpgraff> What is "some things"
[13:43:04] <mvpgraff> lol
[13:43:39] <Acrack> :D, gameIds contains a list of game ids and that list according to what game i have selected increase
[13:44:00] <Acrack> when i close my thing that add game i want that, gameIds return to its origin state
[13:44:09] <Acrack> sorry if im not clear xD
[13:44:30] <mvpgraff> well you're telling gameIds = storedGameIds;
[13:44:31] <Acrack> mvpgraff: i push stuff in gameIds,
[13:44:59] <jphase> mvpgraff: this looks like it's working good, what's the issue again?
[13:45:00] <Acrack> in another way, how to reset gameIds to be storedGameIds
[13:45:10] <Acrack> hum sec
[13:45:16] <mvpgraff> the error is in between the fields
[13:45:20] <mvpgraff> rather than the end of the group
[13:45:21] <Acrack> gonna edit that fiddle
[13:45:22] <jphase> oh right
[13:45:38] <mvpgraff> :l
[13:46:03] <mvpgraff> It's driving me nuts :D
[13:46:24] <jphase> mvpgraff: I think there's a errorPlacement function you can use inside the options if I remember correctly
[13:47:05] <jphase> yeah, looks like some folks use it here:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6545964/jquery-validation-error-placement
[13:47:31] <jphase> odd thing is, I can't find it on their new site's docs
[13:47:56] <Acrack> mvpgraff: http://jsfiddle.net/3SLSD/1/
[13:48:00] <Acrack> i commented more
[13:48:11] <jphase> oh they mention it on /reference of their site it looks like
[13:48:36] <mvpgraff> jphase link? :)
[13:48:39] <mvpgraff> Thanks!
[13:48:52] <jphase> mvpgraff: this is every mention of that function on their site:  https://www.google.com/search?q=errorPlacement+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fjqueryvalidation.org%2Fdocumentation%2F&oq=errorPlacement+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fjqueryvalidation.org%2Fdocumentation%2F&aqs=chrome..69i57.1263j0j7&sourceid=chrome&espv=210&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8#es_sm=91&espv=210&q=errorPlacement+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fjqueryvalidation.org%2F
[13:49:17] <mvpgraff> yup
[13:49:22] <mvpgraff> Great
[13:49:29] <mvpgraff> thanks :D
[13:49:38] <jphase> looks like they removed it from their docs, at least don't give the examples :[
[13:50:25] <mvpgraff> :(
[13:50:40] <mvpgraff> that stack link helps more than the references
[13:50:41] <mvpgraff> lol
[13:50:46] <jphase> i know hah
[13:51:00] <jphase> I also don't see a class added to your elements due to the grouping, so that'll be tricky and specific
[13:51:15] <Acrack> i updated again : http://jsfiddle.net/3SLSD/2/ if someone can explain that thing plx
[13:51:41] <jphase> they really should add a class or data attribute to the groups so you can do like... $.nearest('group') or some variation
[13:52:09] <mvpgraff> But that was the point of having the control group . _.
[13:52:36] <mvpgraff> But like, if you have multiple inputs in a group, it like throws off the error class in between the inputs which is super strange
[13:53:10] <jphase> yeah, usually this annoys me so much that I end up writing a custom validation that ties into the submit handler on top of using validator
[13:53:45] <jphase> Acrack: that looks like that code is doing exactly what it should. It's returning 1,2,3,5 because you pushed 5 onto the array
[13:54:25] <Acrack> jphase:  but i didn't touch storedGameIds
[13:54:47] <Acrack> i would like storedGameIds stay [1?,2,3]
[13:54:48] <mvpgraff> Yea, I have a fallback on php validation, just trying to make it look pretty with the jquery validation :l
[13:56:43] <mvpgraff> even with the errorPlacement() it doesn't fix it
[13:56:43] <mvpgraff> xD
[13:57:15] <jphase> oic what you're trying to do
[13:57:20] <mobcat40> does remove() remove event listeners on chidlren elements deep inside the element I'm removing?
[13:59:24] <mvpgraff> jphase, there we go.
[13:59:37] <mvpgraff> got it working :l
[13:59:38] <mvpgraff> thanks!
[13:59:44] <jphase> w00t, nice
[14:01:03] <mvpgraff> yea, now it's pusshing my fields down though xD
[14:01:12] <mvpgraff> i'll fix it with CSS though
[14:13:34] <Acrack> HALP plz http://jsfiddle.net/3SLSD/2/
[14:14:34] <jphase> Acrack: you can't set one = to the other, you need to use .slice()
[14:14:37] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/3SLSD/3/
[14:18:39] <Acrack> thx jphase can you juste explain me what does slice do ?
[14:18:48] <Acrack> im on the documentation they aren't very clear
[14:19:39] <jphase> always use MDN for your documentation, it'll make more sense https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice
[14:19:57] <jphase> in their description section it should outline it pretty well, basically makes a copy of the array
[14:20:18] <jphase> you can use it to copy parts of the array or the entire array itself when you don't pass anything to it
[14:20:34] <Acrack> thx a lot mate !
[14:20:37] <jphase> np
[14:33:04] <dekiss> class selector - $(".aa") works on ie8? and is it cross browser comptabile including mobiles and tablets?
[14:37:26] <jphase> dekiss: selectors work on any browser/device that supports jQuery/javascript
[14:41:45] <jphase> even the fancy pseudo selectors that old versions of IE don't support are supported due to jQuery's awesomeness ;)
[15:21:51] <Kamuela> Done is better than perfect.
[15:40:38] <Cache_Money> How do make an accordion start out collapsed?  http://jsfiddle.net/B267n/
[15:50:51] <Kamuela> Cache_Money: $('nameofelement').ready($('nameofelement').collapse());
[15:53:49] <Cache_Money> Kamuela: That didn't work...
[15:54:31] <shoky> Cache_Money: http://jsfiddle.net/B267n/1/

[15:55:10] <Cache_Money> shoky:  Ahh, thanks!
[16:09:03] <Siecje> If I make my submit button hidden I can still hit enter and submit the form but if I make the <tr> that my submit button is in hidden I can't hit enter to submit the form
[16:22:45] <Siecje> I can double click to edit a field but I can't hit enter to submit. http://jsfiddle.net/UfX2P/ I have to click away which makes the submit input appear and then I can double click to get back to the field and use enter to submit the form.
[16:30:38] <dekiss> how can I get the clicked element with jquery?
[16:31:21] <tw2113> $('#selector').on('click',function(){ $(this).doSomething(); });
[16:31:46] <dekiss> tw2113 thanks
[16:46:18] <tw2113> uh oh, it's garann
[16:47:32] <garann> hide your valuables
[16:47:33] <b-ot> garann: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[16:47:37] <garann> `read
[16:47:38] <b-ot> garann: From miketaylr, 3mon 6d ago: i did a thing even tho i'm a white male https://miketaylr.com/posts/2013/09/crazypants-useragent-string.html
[16:48:09] <tw2113> wow, that's an old message
[17:06:44] <dekiss> what's the easiest way to check if jquery is loaded? alert($)? :)
[17:10:37] <tw2113> console.log(jQuery);
[17:32:14] <dblosevn> if ('jQuery' in window) :-)
[18:56:57] <dekiss> this is in  for loop is this ok? if (lll[i].addEventListener) {
[19:00:17] <dekiss> how can I check if the browser is ie8 easy?
[19:06:47] <hugo_moss> why do jquery animations not fire unless ive released my finger from the screen? even if im using ontouchstart event
[19:07:25] <dblosevn> hugo_moss: because javascript is singlethreaded and the event doesnt complete until you release your finger
[19:09:16] <hugo_moss> damn thank you for that
[19:09:28] <dblosevn> dekiss: maybe navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8/)
[19:09:35] <hugo_moss> had to strip code out until i figured what was going on
[19:10:01] <hugo_moss> can you give a little more detail i dont quite understand fully
[19:13:50] <dblosevn> well if javascript only uses one thread and the thread is blocking waiting for your finger to release, animations arent possible because the ui thread is blocked being js runs on the ui thread
[19:16:32] <hugo_moss> thank you
[19:16:35] <hugo_moss> i understand
[19:17:22] <hugo_moss> but
[19:17:39] <hugo_moss> why does it block and wait for you to release your finger?
[19:17:59] <hugo_moss> why doesn't it just immediately execute the animation
[19:19:00] <hugo_moss> o because theyre in separate threads
[19:19:44] <dblosevn> correction, because there not in seperate threads
[19:20:02] <dblosevn> if they were in seperate threads you wouldnt have an issue
[19:22:13] <hugo_moss> why does it block until your finger releases?
[19:25:24] <hugo_moss> the event doesnt complete until you release your finger <-- but this is a touchstart event, not a touchmove or touchend?
[19:25:53] <dblosevn> it may be an issue with your code thats causing the blocking
[19:26:28] <dblosevn> paste your code up and ill take a glance at it
[19:36:35] <suncat100> JOIN #foundation
[19:36:38] <suncat100> oops
[19:48:12] <hugo_moss> dbloseven: http://jsfiddle.net/4GEsF/1/
[19:48:24] <hugo_moss> it only happens on ios
[19:48:35] <hugo_moss> probably other mobile devices dunno
[20:36:02] <dblosevn> hugo_moss: sorry irc didnt alert me when I got a message :-(
[20:36:41] <dblosevn> oh... you spelled my name wrong of course it didnt :-)
[20:40:29] <hugo_moss> hey dblosevn
[20:40:31] <dblosevn> hugo_moss: does it not work on a pc? I see all the frames at once, ps I have a multitouch display
[20:40:43] <dblosevn> tried chrome/safari
[20:40:44] <hugo_moss> yea for some reason its not working on the pc
[20:40:53] <hugo_moss> but it works on touch
[20:40:56] <hugo_moss> with changes
[20:41:04] <hugo_moss> on my safari
[20:41:07] <hugo_moss> i didnt update that
[20:41:09] <hugo_moss> sorry
[20:41:12] <hugo_moss> that was just the code
[20:41:27] <hugo_moss> i need to update the fiddle
[20:41:30] <dblosevn> let me dig out the ipad I guess :-) and the droid
[20:41:33] <hugo_moss> im experimenting with jquery mobile
[20:41:46] <hugo_moss> hammer was doing better
[20:42:47] <dblosevn> while im finding devices what do you think I could do with this to make it more intuitive? http://lxedev.com/calcgap-lang/admin.php not really caring about looks as much as function on this
[20:47:02] <hugo_moss> that keeps track of all translations for the english boxes?
[20:47:15] <hugo_moss> its not a translator itself right
[20:47:21] <dblosevn> its for entering translations in all the other languages
[20:47:28] <hugo_moss> oh ok
[20:47:31] <hugo_moss> so it stores them
[20:47:35] <dblosevn> I cant use machine translations, client is pretty anal about that
[20:47:42] <hugo_moss> ok
[20:47:58] <dblosevn> its just a data entry form
[20:48:02] <hugo_moss> oh ok
[20:48:18] <hugo_moss> what other functionality are you looking for
[20:48:26] <hugo_moss> or hes lookin for
[20:48:37] <dblosevn> well they arent paying for it so not much :-)
[20:48:49] <dblosevn> I just dont want to deal with inputting the translations they send me
[20:49:24] <dblosevn> but I would like to do something to make the data entry a little easier on the eyes but leave the ability to enter data for all languages at the saame time
[20:51:11] <hugo_moss> hmm
[20:51:14] <hugo_moss> i have no idea
[20:51:19] <hugo_moss> what is it for trucking?
[20:51:21] <dblosevn> I was thinking somehow expanding the english and current selected column on focus of another column then colapsing it back on blur
[20:51:31] <dblosevn> http://lxedev.com/calcgap
[20:52:05] <hugo_moss> ooh thats good
[20:53:52] <dblosevn> I get the same thing safari/ios
[20:54:27] <hugo_moss> yea thats really good
[20:54:37] <hugo_moss> good job
[20:54:49] <dblosevn> well /2 gives me one frame
[20:55:11] <hugo_moss> ./2?
[20:55:12] <dblosevn> so on touchstart it should start animating?
[20:55:17] <dblosevn> your fiddle
[20:55:20] <hugo_moss> oh ok
[20:55:29] <hugo_moss> yea
[20:55:34] <hugo_moss> on touchstart it should animate
[20:55:49] <dblosevn> doesnt
[20:55:56] <dblosevn> nor does it when you release
[20:55:57] <hugo_moss> nah it doesnt work on the jsfiddle
[20:56:10] <hugo_moss> it works on the code
[20:56:17] <hugo_moss> on the site
[20:56:24] <hugo_moss> but i just posted that for reference
[20:56:43] <hugo_moss> does jsfiddle support ios?
[20:56:56] <dblosevn> not seeming so, the menu options dont work :-(
[20:57:06] <hugo_moss> yea thats what i figured
[20:57:59] <hugo_moss> well i was trying to understand why it wasnt working
[20:58:02] <hugo_moss> but you explained it
[20:58:06] <hugo_moss> and i kind of got it
[20:58:47] <hugo_moss> now im trying to figure out why the threshold parameters that i set for jquery mobile dont seem to be registering swipes
[21:04:42] <dblosevn> im not seeing any of these events in the code, swipe* touch* etc
[21:04:55] <dblosevn> I thoguht you wanted me to look at why your touchstart was blocking?
[21:06:21] <hugo_moss> sorry about that
[21:06:34] <hugo_moss> im kind of falling asleep
[21:08:38] <hugo_moss> can you try the site on your ipad
[21:11:08] <dblosevn> ya whats the url?
[21:16:38] <hugo_moss> did you get my pm
[21:54:43] <Hilton> Quiet.
[21:56:56] <Hilton> I'm having some trouble with a checkbox whose value is being submitted via ajax. It seems like the first one or two times it is clicked, I always get a checked value. If the box is toggled twice before submit, then I start getting the correct value.
[21:58:15] <Hilton> Initially I was using inp.value (in a loop on all matched inputs), then I tried using .attr('checked') == 'checked' (if .attr('type') == 'checkbox'), but the results seem to be the same.
[21:58:18] <Hilton> Anyone come across this before?
[22:00:55] <Hilton> It's effect is obvious where I can open an entry for editing, the checkbox is clearly NOT checked, click 'Save', and the value sent is 'on'.
[23:13:12] <Hilton> How can $(checkbox_input).attr('checked') be undefined (correct) but .attr('value') be 'on'?
[23:19:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> Hilton: hey, i wanted to answer your question earlier
[23:20:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> Hilton: attr is not used
[23:20:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> use prop instead
[23:20:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> might give you more desireable behaviour
[23:28:41] <Hilton> Ah, cool. I thought .attr was the way to access element properties? Did that change?
