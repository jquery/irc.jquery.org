[00:03:25] <nebby> Hi there. I have a popover which works on hover. But mobile devices don't have hover. How do I use jquery to tell me if it's a mobile (non mouse) device?
[00:05:56] <oleole> nebby: I use this: var is_touch_device = 'ontouchstart' in document.documentElement ? true : false;
[00:06:18] <oleole> if(is_touch_device){ /* Do something for touch */ }else{ /* Do something for desktop */ }
[00:36:23] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: how can i return this.each from a plugin after an animation is complete on that element?
[00:36:56] <ruby_on_tails> else if i do element.custom().hide() it hides instantly, i want to hide it after the element is animated compeltely inside custom()
[00:43:03] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: you can't
[00:43:28] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: :O there is no way out?
[00:43:44] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: you would have to write a different function and use it instead of .hide
[00:43:56] <Cork> .hide() doens't take animations into account
[00:44:13] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: lets say .animate({opacity: 0}, 200) instead of hide
[00:44:42] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: then it should work by default
[00:44:51] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: let me show you
[00:45:36] <Cork> $.fn.ani = function() { return this.animate(/* something */); }  $(selector).ani().animate({ opacity: 0 }, 200);
[00:47:07] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/s7h9z619/2/
[00:47:18] <ruby_on_tails> the links should turn green and then disappear
[00:47:24] <ruby_on_tails> in chain
[00:47:41] <ruby_on_tails> just like the greenathon chains, disappearance should be chained
[00:47:52] <ruby_on_tails> wave effect
[00:49:27] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: http://jsfiddle.net/s7h9z619/3/
[00:49:53] <Cork> if you use queue, you need to trigger the next set in the queue after you have done your thing
[00:51:12] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: awesome thanks
[00:52:45] <sammych> jQM: can I get the popups to scroll inside their own pane?
[00:53:07] <sammych> if an overflowing popup is on the page, I don't want the body to scroll with it
[00:53:33] <sammych> it seems like popup elements are placed as children of body
[00:53:48] <sammych> no matter where I put the markup
[01:16:04] <xertion> In this jsfiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/c6L9rLxt/1/) why is my draggable snapping to the edges of the black container if you come close to the x-guide and y-guide.
[01:16:42] <xertion> Basically, if you move the draggable on the _OUTSIDE_ of the red lines, near the container, it will snap to the container, even the draggable snap is set to "inner" of the x-guide and y-guide
[01:17:18] <ussher_> Trying to find a solution to a race condition.  I have a page that loads a modal window.  Into the modal window the tinymce editor is added to a textfield.  The issue:  The link to the tinymce editor is in the <head of that page along with a document.ready to initialize the editor.  Since its loaded via ajax document.ready is instantly ready, so the init fires before the function is defined.  Any way to re-fire document ready?
[01:19:54] <Woet> xertion: not sure what you mean, it works fine for me: http://i.imgur.com/qGVVNQE.png
[01:20:26] <xertion> Woet, if you try to drag the "Drag Me" box to the OUTSIDE of the red lines, close to the border of the container
[01:20:33] <xertion> you will see that it snaps to the container instead of the red lines
[01:20:44] <Woet> xertion: i can't get it outside of the red lines since your script updates their position each time.
[01:21:01] <Woet> please make a screenshot of what you mean
[01:21:15] <xertion> Woet https://www.dropbox.com/s/2gwa9onfm49jo40/Sk%C3%A4rmdump%202014-09-17%2015.20.56.png?dl=0
[01:21:27] <Woet> is that while dragging?
[01:21:32] <xertion> Yes
[01:21:35] <xertion> you can feel it snapping
[01:21:37] <Macaveli> What's a bubbling click event,
[01:21:56] <Woet> it really isn't for me
[01:22:12] <xertion> It only happens close to the red lines
[01:22:21] <xertion> if I go further away, it does not snap to the container
[01:22:24] <xertion> :/
[01:22:43] <Woet> for me it snaps between the red lines
[01:22:55] <Woet> and never to the container
[01:23:09] <Woet> okay, i see what you mean now
[01:23:19] <Woet> only close to the red lines
[01:23:22] <xertion> Yea.
[01:23:49] <Woet> not sure then
[01:55:10] <adrian__> Hello
[02:08:54] <Snoopal> hey guys im doing an ajax request with type 'json' and in backend i echo the results with json_encode($results); but the request fails and says  failed parseerror. if i set the ajax request to html i get the information but all " are translated to &quote; any ideas?
[02:10:32] <mooncup> Snoopal: can you do var_dump($results) and pastebin it
[02:10:52] <Snoopal> !pastebin
[02:10:56] <Snoopal> hmm no bot :D
[02:11:35] <mooncup> pastie.org
[02:13:09] <Snoopal> http://pastie.org/9561346
[02:15:37] <gryyy> so this is what $results looks like before you try to json_encode it?
[02:16:01] <Snoopal> yes. but i just found the error! it was a function of wordpress which escaped the result again
[02:16:31] <gryyy> It's still weird that you would get a parseerror
[02:17:20] <Snoopal> hm
[02:19:29] <Snoopal> ok but this leads me to another problem. after i got the result i want to change a data attribute. but it does not change it. i tried $('.selector').data('initdates',result); and $('.selector').attr('data-initdates',result); but it does not change the value. any ideas?
[02:21:35] <systemfault> Snoopal: You won't see anything in the DOM inspector.
[02:21:42] <systemfault> Because it doesn't work like that.
[02:22:49] <systemfault> The DOM inspector is a blessing and a curse at the same time... it's really good to have a overview of the DOM but at the same time, it makes people think that the DOM is HTML
[02:23:12] <Snoopal> really? usually i see when things changes ? hmm strange
[02:23:32] <gryyy> systemfault: Yeah I'm not really following as well
[02:23:33] <systemfault> Snoopal: Some of the changes will reflect on the DOM inspector... but not all.
[02:24:19] <systemfault> In the case of .data, it's because jQuery stores a copy of the date within the attribute somewhere else.. out of the DOM.
[02:24:24] <systemfault> *data
[02:24:34] <systemfault> Because DOM access are slow.
[02:24:53] <gt8ost4l> anyone of a good jquery/javascript tutorial i could incorporate to my page
[02:25:10] <gt8ost4l> i mean slideshow
[02:25:18] <gryyy> Huh, I just tested it. You're right. I didn't know that. That's good to know.
[02:25:30] <damiano> hello friends
[02:25:35] <gt8ost4l> you know with buttons for pause and previous and forward
[02:27:13] <damiano> is there a way to optimize this simple code? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8ec6a9a71da61b7e1be0
[02:27:32] <systemfault> Snoopal: See this example
[02:27:33] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/pm88cfjp/1/
[02:28:15] <systemfault> I set the value attribute to FOO and if you click on the "lol" link, the value of the input will be set to "BAR"
[02:28:31] <systemfault> But.. if you look at the DOM inspector, it will still be written... value="FOO"
[02:29:02] <Snoopal> systemfault: ok so i tried to do console.log($('.selector').data('initdates')); after i used $('.selector').data('initdates',result); i get undefined...
[02:29:06] <Snoopal> systemfault: true story!
[02:29:11] <Snoopal> thx for the insight
[02:29:23] <sacho_> plunker, please
[02:29:30] <sacho_> oh wrong channel, jsfiddle please
[02:29:55] <systemfault> damiano: There's no optimization to do here.
[02:31:17] <gryyy> Snoopal: What do you get when you do console.log(result) ?
[02:31:48] <damiano> systemfault, ok thanks
[02:32:27] <Snoopal> the right result. and again. i did a mistake. had a typo ^^
[02:32:31] <Snoopal> $Â§(Â§"$(Â§()$)("Â§/$
[02:32:33] <Snoopal> :D

[02:43:42] <Cork> mukesh_: you can't do that
[02:43:50] <Cork> php is server side and js is client side
[02:43:59] <Cork> you can't access server data client side
[02:44:12] <Cork> if you want to store the php value so js can access it
[02:44:18] <Cork> echo it into a js variable
[02:44:21] <mukesh_> string have signal and double quote. so string is breal

[02:49:14] <HowardwLo> ah, switch, got it
[02:49:32] <Cork> or ya var id = $(this).find('a').attr('id'); if(id ==) {} else if(id ==) {}
[02:49:48] <Cork> but never do the dom traversal for every check >_<
[02:49:49] <HowardwLo> all the same?
[02:49:55] <Cork> its basically the same thing
[02:50:00] <HowardwLo> $() is dom traversal?
[02:50:05] <Cork> .find does
[02:50:08] <HowardwLo> ic
[02:50:23] <HowardwLo> thanks!
[02:50:31] <Cork> well actually it does more then just a traversal
[02:50:42] <Cork> it makes a query to dom with querySelectorAll
[02:50:51] <Cork> but that results in a traversal by the browser

[03:49:58] <PyDon> hi
[03:51:05] <PyDon> can anyone help me? i have a webpage which lists thousands of entries. every entry has a badge and a button. it turns out that adding the button slows down the scroll speed too much. any idea how to speed that up?
[03:52:08] <Woet> PyDon: please provide a demo on jsfiddle
[04:00:58] <PyDon> @Woet: Sorry, i forgot to mention I use bootstrap.
[04:01:10] <Woet> okay, same question.
[04:01:11] <PyDon> the button is from bootstrap - i forgot
[04:01:20] <PyDon> does jfiddle support bootstrap includes?
[04:03:13] <Woet> why would it not?
[04:03:35] <Kartagis> what am I missing here? http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/umyL5sm3/
[04:03:40] * Kartagis runs
[04:06:02] <Woet> Kartagis: did you try checking the console?
[04:06:23] <Kartagis> Woet: nothing
[04:06:35] <Woet> then you are doing it wrong.
[04:06:40] <Woet> your jsfiddle causes 1 error in the console
[04:06:48] <decx> you are missing ) and )
[04:07:06] <decx> one after textarea one after val
[04:07:38] <Woet> Kartagis: how are you checking the console exactly?
[04:07:39] <decx> maybe writing it all in one line with no spacing was a bad idea !
[04:08:12] <Kartagis> Woet: hitting f12 and checking the console tab
[04:08:21] <Woet> Kartagis: please make a screenshot
[04:08:30] <Kartagis> woops
[04:08:56] <decx> and it does give an error
[04:09:11] <Kartagis> Woet: looked at the wrong thing
[04:09:30] <Woet> decx: generally you want to help people learn how to debug, rather than giving them the answer
[04:09:32] <Kartagis> I removed the troublesome )
[04:10:09] <Woet> Kartagis: that's not the problem, but you know how to debug it now. use the console to debug it further and fix it properly.
[04:10:22] <decx> i think i have a firm grasp on how to help people here -.-
[04:10:38] <decx> the problem was shitty formatting leading to not noticing an obvious mistake
[04:10:38] <Woet> decx: then why tell them the answer if they can easily debug it themselves?
[04:12:59] <PyDon> http://jsfiddle.net/vnzL65ds/
[04:13:14] <PyDon> can anyone help me to find out how to speedup the scrolling with these thousands of buttons?
[04:13:54] <decx> dont have thousands of buttons
[04:14:03] <PyDon> at least on firefox it works pretty fine. chrome and safari lag
[04:14:23] <Woet> PyDon: why would you draw 5500 rows of data at once?
[04:14:51] <Kartagis> Woet: got it, lacking a combination of ) and }
[04:15:23] <PyDon> Woet: people want to scroll the data. i also thought about introducing pages or scrolling on demand but that doesn't help. the people want to scroll down to the entry they are looking for
[04:15:34] <Woet> PyDon: so make it infinitely scrollable
[04:15:46] <Woet> detect when scrolling down appears the end of the table, load ~ 100 more rows
[04:15:52] <Woet> approaches *
[04:17:10] <PyDon> woet: that doesn't speedup the srolling speed when they loaded the entire dataset.
[04:17:23] <Woet> PyDon: remove 100 rows from the top when you do that.
[04:17:28] <PyDon> Woet: btw, there are also people which use the scrollbar and go directly to the bottom.
[04:17:49] <PyDon> how can I handle that?
[04:17:49] <Woet> well a different question then
[04:17:55] <Woet> why do people have to scroll down to the entry they are looking for?
[04:18:02] <Woet> sounds like you just need to add a filter option
[04:18:49] <PyDon> woet: the system creates files from 0-9000 and its fragmented so people browse the list to see if files are missing
[04:19:04] <Woet> right
[04:19:21] <Woet> so why would they want to go directly to the bottom?
[04:19:31] <PyDon> i don't know the filenames, i don't know what they are looking for, but the users do.
[04:19:49] <PyDon> do you have another idea?
[04:19:53] <Woet> well maybe you want to figure out user requirements and base your interface on that :)
[04:19:56] <uskerine> is there any way to ensure that when user is editing an input or textbox item, the next time tab is press it will go to a given element?
[04:20:11] <uskerine> the input and textboxes are generated dynamically in datatables
[04:20:18] <decx> PyDon look at how webmaster tools from google handles the crawling error list
[04:20:18] <Woet> uskerine: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement.tabIndex
[04:20:34] <Woet> or do you mean wherever on the form they are?
[04:20:39] <decx> those can be sets in the thousands and the ux is pretty okish
[04:20:52] <PyDon> decx: do you have a link for me?
[04:21:04] <PyDon> as an example?
[04:21:08] <Woet> http://api.jquery.com/keydown/
[04:21:22] <decx> it's just a paginated list with a filter input on top
[04:21:31] <uskerine> thanks Woet I will think if that.tabIndex might work
[04:21:39] <PyDon> oh, ok
[04:25:02] <uskerine> this returns undefined alert('this element tabindex='+this.tabindex);
[04:25:25] <uskerine> oops, tabIndex
[04:30:18] <gurke_> why does #offer:checked not work? i wanted to check if $('#offer:checked') { ... } but it is not working? :<
[04:30:47] <ocmnt> gurke_, try $('#offer').is(':checked')
[04:30:52] <ocmnt> or is(':selected')
[04:30:52] <gurke_> ty
[04:32:16] <gurke_> nice ocmnt.. works :) thanks
[04:34:30] <gurke_> ocmnt another problem is... .css() the max-height attribute is not changing
[04:34:34] <decx> right, that is because #offer:checked will just create an empty object which cant be tested against in that fashion
[04:35:01] <decx> if it's not checked that is
[04:35:44] <decx> just semantics but max-height isnt an attribute
[04:36:53] <gurke_> hmm the childs are expanding faster then the parent.. and i change the height.. so the childs are out of box.. how do i prevent that?
[04:37:10] <gurke_> because they instantly increase the height
[04:37:22] <gurke_> iam using css3 transition
[04:37:23] <uskerine> Woet I think I can manage to assign tabindex's to the elements when they are dynamically generated, thanks.
[04:37:34] <Woet> uskerine: no worries
[04:38:12] <decx> dont have a max height then
[04:38:14] <gurke_> i think i need to use animate()
[04:38:21] <decx> i dont get what you are doing
[04:38:23] <decx> fiddle up
[04:38:43] <uskerine> how can you turn varFoo, which holds a number between 0 and 1000 into a string "with %04d format", so if varFoo = 33, varFooString would be "0033"
[04:39:19] <ocmnt> gurke_, you could put overflow:hidden on the parent I think
[04:39:59] <gurke_> great.. thanks ocmnt :)
[04:40:12] <ocmnt> that way they expand inside the parent element, without being visible outside of it
[04:40:43] <HikaruBG> hi guys, when I pass to a variable someVar =  $(#someDivID DIV.active)
[04:40:59] <HikaruBG> what does someVar.next() ?
[04:41:15] <decx> the element after div.active
[04:41:18] <HikaruBG> hi guys, when I pass to a variable someVar =  $(#someDivID DIV.active)  what someVar.next() does ?
[04:41:22] <HikaruBG> OK
[04:41:28] <HikaruBG> decx,
[04:41:55] <HikaruBG> decx, and when the active is the last element of the children of someDIV ?
[04:42:00] <HikaruBG> decx, and when the active is the last element of the children of someDiv  ?
[04:42:04] <decx> then it's an empty object
[04:42:18] <HikaruBG> decx, how to loop them from the beginning ?
[04:42:29] <decx> google "next or first jquery"
[04:43:09] <HikaruBG> OK, and one more question decx, how to check for an empty object?
[04:43:21] <decx> .length
[04:44:07] <ocmnt> HikaruBG, you could also check index of the next() object
[04:44:38] <ocmnt> if index >= #somedivid div.length you have reached the last element
[04:44:56] <ocmnt> or try object === $('#simeDivID div).last()
[04:45:00] <ocmnt> not sure though that works
[04:45:03] <HikaruBG> ocmnt, meaning I can get the length of the someVar and create a for loop ?
[04:45:31] <decx> if (element.next().length) is the easiest check imho
[04:46:32] <decx> something like: var nextorfirst = (element.next().length) ? element.next() : element.siblings().eq(0)
[04:47:01] <HikaruBG> i haven't been working with jquery for a while and there are so many changes....
[04:47:31] <Uhkis> many changes? how long have you been out of jquery?
[04:47:58] <HikaruBG> decx, the goal is to loop through the children of a div forever. do you have an idea how to accomplish that?
[04:48:18] <HikaruBG> and to assign .active to only one
[04:48:42] <decx> with help of the line i just wrote
[04:54:45] <decx> so, any progress HikaruBG?
[04:56:28] <gurke_> when i use .css() can i do something like currentHeight+200?
[04:56:44] <decx> depends on how performant you want it to be
[04:56:55] <uskerine> how do I say "everything" in jQuery?
[04:56:58] <gurke_> does not matter.. its just a contact formular
[04:57:06] <uskerine> I want to do: $('').removeAttr("tabindex");
[04:57:14] <uskerine> for every html item
[04:57:18] <gurke_> $('*')
[04:57:21] <uskerine> thanks
[04:57:22] <Hausas> I want to execute a function when the div is being hidden. How do I do that? Override jQuery.fn.hide ?
[04:57:29] <decx> ie .css('height',function(index,oldheight){ return oldheight.replace('px','') + 200 })
[04:57:51] <gurke_> ill try that decx
[04:58:18] <decx> in performance dependent situations it'll be faster to cache the old height
[04:58:40] <decx> because those css return functions are slow as they check and set
[04:58:53] <decx> with a cached height you can set directly
[04:59:12] <gurke_> mmmmh
[04:59:35] <gurke_> so just using $height = start_attribute.. then change $height to what ever?
[05:00:03] <gurke_> i think that might be a good solution
[05:00:39] <uskerine> what is wrong with this?  $('*').each().attr("tabindex","-1");
[05:01:52] <decx> many things
[05:02:07] <uskerine> please elaborate
[05:02:11] <decx> * is shit
[05:02:20] <decx> each doesnt chain like that
[05:02:40] <decx> each(function(){ $(this).method() })
[05:03:37] <uskerine> thanks it works
[05:03:45] <uskerine> decx, is there a better way to remove all tabindex from the page?
[05:04:09] <decx> why would you even do that?
[05:04:09] <uskerine> '*' might be shit, but I can't think a better way of doing it.
[05:04:40] <uskerine> well I have a mess with the tab's, so I want to remove everything and explicity say which items have tabindex, both static and programatically generated ones
[05:05:13] <decx> sort out your tabindexes in your markup when you generate it not clientside
[05:05:26] <decx> you enter a world of hurt
[05:06:13] <uskerine> I agree, but I am using plugins and stuff, ensuring that all items have a proper -1 might be challenging
[05:07:01] <uskerine> I have read that in html5 everything has a tabindex
[05:07:06] <HikaruBG> decx, what does element.siblings().eq(0) do?
[05:07:25] <HikaruBG> assigns the first child to an element?
[05:07:31] <decx> get's the elements siblings in a collection and uses the first one
[05:07:34] <decx> gets
[05:07:41] <gurke_> decx, http://jsfiddle.net/rv5o8qcw/
[05:07:42] <HikaruBG> ok...
[05:07:54] <gurke_> why is that not working? :)
[05:08:11] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/6a8putob/
[05:11:33] <decx> it doesnt work because css('height') returns a value with px
[05:11:51] <decx> either replace('px','') or get .height()
[05:12:07] <decx> also your formheight var is global
[05:12:14] <decx> also you should cache selectorsy
[05:12:40] <HikaruBG> decx, your expression don't work for me. please take a look:

[05:13:36] <MaxSan> Is there any channels dedicated to MEAN development?
[05:14:12] <shortCircuit__> hi i am pretty very new to jQuery
[05:14:45] <decx> gurke_ make sure you cache selectors that you call multiple times
[05:14:46] <shortCircuit__> i cannot understand why cannot i fire a submit request like this http://jsfiddle.net/bwdz6u16/1/
[05:15:18] <decx> and make you fiddles working, it's just a few extra lines http://jsfiddle.net/decx/rv5o8qcw/1/
[05:15:23] <gurke_> decx contactform = $('.contactform.target'); ?
[05:15:36] <decx> right
[05:15:39] <gurke_> thank you
[05:15:42] <gryyy> shortCircuit__: There's a typo in your Javascript
[05:15:50] <shortCircuit__> where?
[05:15:58] <gryyy> shortCircuit__: Err... I mean html
[05:16:06] <gryyy> shortCircuit__: class="mseacrh"
[05:16:10] <gryyy> On your Form element
[05:16:37] <shortCircuit__> shouldnot have written a class ?
[05:16:56] <gryyy> No, I mean it say "mseacrh" instead of "msearch"
[05:18:03] <shortCircuit__> oh ... chit...
[05:18:05] <gryyy> says*
[05:34:18] <HikaruBG> decx, thanks a million!
[05:34:19] <HikaruBG> :)
[05:35:59] <gurke_> decx... wtf when i uncheck the box the height gets smaller then before...?!
[05:36:09] <gurke_> http://jsfiddle.net/1hfrL7fy/
[05:37:49] <decx> try outerHeight(true) instead of contactform.height()
[05:38:30] <gurke_> perfect... now it works.. :) thanks decx

[05:44:22] <gumble_> what is the best way to pass by an array or string or something from my php to my javascript?
[05:49:01] <decx> generate json
[05:50:15] <shortCircuit__> hah
[05:50:32] <uskerine> how do I say "all childs" from a given #id?
[05:51:09] <decx> .children() for direct children
[05:51:29] <uskerine> I want the whole tree
[05:51:51] <decx> .find('*') which will be superslow
[05:52:05] <uskerine> it is a small tree (table)
[05:52:11] <decx> or .contents() which handles textnodes separately
[05:52:30] <uskerine> what is faster?
[05:52:37] <uskerine> I want to set all tabindex to -1
[05:52:45] <decx> booh
[05:52:53] <uskerine> well
[05:53:31] <uskerine> If you know how any alternative way to set up all tabindex to -1 except inner input and textareas in a row added via  datatable API, I am listening :)
[05:54:13] <decx> might as well use an attribute selector
[05:54:23] <decx> find('[tabindex]')
[05:55:04] <uskerine> there is no attribute
[05:55:09] <uskerine> I have to force it to -1
[05:56:10] <uskerine> then I set up a proper number depending on the row and column on the specific elements that have to participate in the TAB fiesta
[06:13:26] <aitiba> hi
[06:15:21] <aitiba> I have a function that on click makes html and then I would like to make more events on that new html. I think that is a jquery cache problem but I'm not sure. ¿How can I fix it please?
[06:32:14] <elmcrest> hi everybody. I have a selector within functionFoo(){ console.log($(".classname").length); }; where I expect a none-zero value since there are several elements with this class. but somehow the selector doesn't work anymore and I have no idea. any hints are appreciated :)
[06:34:19] <elmcrest> ok my fault ... forget that question ^^
[06:34:36] <SOSA_> Ugh I';m having some browser specific issues in Firefox. Can someone help me figure out why?
[06:36:24] <BillCriswell> elmcrest: Sounds like you are doing it before the document is ready.
[06:36:30] <dmsuperman> SOSA_: don't ask to ask, just ask
[06:38:13] <BillCriswell> elmcrest: You either have to do it right before the </body> or in the <head> wrapped in a $(function(){ ... });
[06:39:01] <elmcrest> BillCriswell no actually I had a double class attribute definion on the element ... like <td class="classA" class="classB"... and the second definition is ignored - somehow obvious. sometime staring at the code doesn't help until rubber duck debugging :)
[06:39:02] <SOSA_> Okay, dmsuperman  - heres the live version. It works fine in Chrome, but in firefox, after searching and then searching again on the homepage, it breaks. http://businesstent.net/stockzi/
[06:39:49] <elmcrest> BillCriswell fyi in case you didn't heard of that :) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
[06:40:03] <SOSA_> I only got one day to fix this, and im getting unpaid :( It's stressing, really hope someone can help!
[06:40:12] <BillCriswell> elmcrest: I have.
[06:40:46] <elmcrest> BillCriswell ok ... I really like that :) ... it's quite often that when asking a question somewhere the solution magically appears :)

[07:25:30] <mento> the page should show a count down timer and on 12 o clock it should hide a div

[07:27:42] <BinaryKitten> mento, you need to get the current time and set an interval to update it
[07:27:55] <BinaryKitten> then check the time and do the thing when it matches the basic time
[07:28:59] <mento> BinaryKitten: sound good :) thanks!
[07:33:14] <Bhuyhit> exactly what I need is to set currency values
[07:33:21] <Bhuyhit> some idea?
[07:34:08] <dmsuperman> Bhuyhit: parseInt will allow you to remove the decimal point (I think it just drops the decimal, no rounding)
[07:35:10] <dmsuperman> focus on all the right things
[07:35:19] <dmsuperman> woops wrong chan
[07:45:14] <Woet> so, it's probably something simple, but why doesn't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/ftsub0w5/
[07:46:58] <BillCriswell> Woet: I think you want $.each(data, ...); and not $(data).each()
[07:47:46] <Woet> that works, i was always under the impression they did the same
[07:47:48] <Woet> thanks BillCriswell!
[07:48:52] <basiclaser> hey guys i got hired to rebuild a domains and hosting package sales site. they want a modern look, with client-CMS, all hooked up and dynamically bound to a new python API they are building. The site will not be SPA . Should I learn angularJS or pick something else?
[07:50:26] <MikeD_> if i want to test the function inside .each() by limiting the $( ) collection to only the first match found, what's the easiest way to do it?
[07:53:39] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: You can do .first()
[07:54:05] <BillCriswell> You could also just return false in the function to run it once.
[07:54:43] <MikeD_> yeah, first() is pretty intuitive... that's why i didn't think of it.
[07:55:05] <decx> .eq(0) all the way

[08:00:16] <abailarri> Hello. I have a jquery script with a very very strange behavior
[08:00:32] <MikeD_> Bhuyhit:  you didn't even supply a test once you pasted that function in?
[08:00:56] <abailarri> In the script I have an ajax function that triggers when a div class is clicked. I have another function that triggers another ajax with another div
[08:01:19] <abailarri> but when I click on this div, it trigges the first ajax!!!!!!! Why!!!!!!!!!
[08:01:40] <MikeD_> is one div inside the other?
[08:03:01] <Bhuyhit> http://jsfiddle.net/nj91pdpu/1/
[08:03:03] <Bhuyhit> here is the test
[08:03:50] <SOSA_> 4 days redesigning an app isn't that bad rgiht?
[08:03:51] <decx> the so answer you took that function from works just fine
[08:03:58] <Bhuyhit> alll that I need is to put dots
[08:04:05] <Bhuyhit> all*
[08:04:14] <abailarri> Bhuyhit, do you talking with me?
[08:04:28] <MikeD_> Bhuyhit: what do you expect to happen?
[08:04:50] <MikeD_> n.toFixed(0) isn't going to add commas... so there's no comma to replace
[08:05:06] <Bhuyhit> http://jsfiddle.net/nj91pdpu/2/
[08:05:17] <Bhuyhit> with this script works but with ,
[08:05:24] <Bhuyhit> I need it with dots instead ,
[08:05:31] <decx> return currency + " " + n.toFixed(2).replace(/(\d)(?=(\d{3})+\.)/g, "$1,");
[08:05:55] <MikeD_> "here, have a fish"
[08:06:21] <decx> give a man a fish, you feed him for a day, give a man a poisenous fish you feed him for the rest of his life
[08:06:28] <MikeD_> haha
[08:06:41] <Bhuyhit> decx : this doens't works for me becuase I don't need decimal values
[08:06:46] <Bhuyhit> doesn't*
[08:07:03] <decx> but you said you need dots
[08:07:33] <Bhuyhit> yes
[08:07:46] <Bhuyhit> I need the separators be dots
[08:08:14] <decx> well change , with . in the function then
[08:08:48] <MikeD_> or keep it exactly as given, but truncate the decimals then change the , to .
[08:09:08] <MikeD_> add fish sauce
[08:09:27] <MikeD_> wait, is fish sauce supposed to be put on fish or made of fish?
[08:09:28] <Bhuyhit> I already made that but doesn't show me neither separator
[08:10:08] <MikeD_> are you really saying "I want every three numbers separated by literal . starting from the right and counting towards the left" ?
[08:10:25] <Bhuyhit> yes
[08:10:27] <Bhuyhit> why?
[08:14:32] <MikeD_> the right to left part is trickier to regex than I thought
[08:14:51] <Bhuyhit> solved it
[08:28:32] <axilla> does anyone know or has seen some documentation on what the performance costs are of using .find to find an element vs. direct targeting of the element?

[08:39:29] <scar> ive seen it once before
[08:40:00] <robertmaxrees> you mean like an infinite scrolling carousel type of thing?
[08:40:28] <scar> well i mean it is definately a carousel, but the infinite part doesnt really matter, though i suppose it would need to be
[08:40:35] <scar> the effect is what i'm mainly looking for
[08:41:49] <decx> every slider/carousel has that
[08:42:09] <robertmaxrees> why not just look at another carousel's source to see how they do it?
[08:42:29] <scar> because i cannot figure out the site i saw it on
[08:42:33] <decx> no point investing many hours into ironing out edgecases when it's been done oh so often, unless it's for a training exp
[08:42:40] <NoiseEee> or google 'jquery carousels' for a longer period of time
[08:42:44] <robertmaxrees> check out bxslider
[08:42:47] <NoiseEee> you'll find a few that match what you're looking for
[08:42:48] <scar> i understand every slider has carousels
[08:42:56] <decx> i thought slick is the new cool thing
[08:43:05] <scar> i'm looking for an effect on the carousel
[08:43:07] <robertmaxrees> slick is a carousel.
[08:44:17] <scar> think of an actual carousel, it's a ring in a way
[08:44:35] <robertmaxrees> scar we know what you're talking about - the little previews to the left and right of the current item.
[08:44:49] <scar> yeah but when you click next, it "swings" into view
[08:44:56] <scar> ok just making sure. :) sorry ha
[08:44:59] <robertmaxrees> sure.  that's just an easing.
[08:45:05] <jeffmjack> I'm using text() to try to inject HTML into a div, but the browser isn't parsing the text I'm injecting as HTML (the HTML is showing up as a string).  What do I need to be doing?
[08:45:06] <scar> ahh, interesting.
[08:45:21] <robertmaxrees> well, an animation, sometimes with an easing.
[08:45:32] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack use .html() instead.
[08:45:43] <scar> i've seen it before, so i was hoping it was something common. i guess it's not? gonna have to play with easings?
[08:45:45] <jeffmjack> robertmaxrees: thanks I'll try it :)
[08:45:59] <scar> all the easings i have seen are 2d really
[08:46:24] <robertmaxrees> scar we're saying that could be done with almost any available carousel.
[08:46:46] <SOSA_> robertmaxrees:
[08:46:46] <scar> yes i'm aware it can be done with any, and i use BX. i'm curious as to how to even begin to create that effect
[08:46:49] <SOSA_> I need your help dearly
[08:46:56] <jeffmjack> robertmaxrees: that worked, thanks!
[08:46:57] <SOSA_> I got just today to fix these problems
[08:47:00] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack fsho
[08:47:03] <scar> no examples on any of the sliders i've seen that have that effect.
[08:47:10] <SOSA_> or he'll do it himself and take -4 hours off :(
[08:47:10] <robertmaxrees> SOSA_ you'll want to ask the room ;)
[08:47:17] <SOSA_> Do you use firefox?
[08:47:18] <decx> you can fake 3d by having the inactive slide at scale(0.8)
[08:47:37] <decx> or some translate3d kerfuffle
[08:47:44] <robertmaxrees> SOSA_ ask the room duder.
[08:48:03] <scar> hmmm
[08:48:03] <SOSA_> It seems like when you first open the app in the browser, it breaks. The first form click event doesn't bind or whatever, The "transition" kinda happens. Like so
[08:48:19] <SOSA_> robertmaxrees:  http://screencast.com/t/DX9f1817k9c
[08:48:59] <robertmaxrees> folks are going to want functional examples of your code btw.
[08:49:23] <SOSA_> Okay, may a live example work?
[08:49:31] <Bhuyhit> why with this function if I set 0 decimal doesn't ahow me dots
[08:49:32] <Bhuyhit> function formatUSD(n, x, currency) {     return currency + " " + n.toFixed(x).replace(/(\d)(?=(\d{3})+\.)/g, "$1,"); }
[08:49:45] <robertmaxrees> your example might, but be aware it's a LOT of code and folks might not have time to help.
[08:49:45] <Bhuyhit> but if I set 2 to decimals show ok
[08:49:59] <robertmaxrees> Bhuyhit can you set up a fiddle showing how you're using that?

[09:01:55] <uskerine> I am trying to programatically assign tabindex to a dynamically generated datatables row. What is wrong with this? $('#fooTable').find('input').each(function(){ alert('inside'); $(this).attr("tabindex",index++); });  It nevers go through the each function despite I positively know that there are input fields there
[09:03:43] <kamikaz3> hello
[09:03:50] <uskerine> that's inside a function which is called after the row is inserted
[09:06:34] <kamikaz3> I am trying to load elements into a div from ajax and for that div I have a jquery .on() function that will run on scroll
[09:08:41] <phantomxc> Has anyone run into trying to modify the css transform property with jquery.css and it not taking effect in safari? Here's a basic example based of code from a 3rd party library that I'm using. http://jsfiddle.net/a7Lc4kw7/3/  The fiddle is working but the library only applies the transition changes to the element. Any thoughts?
[09:12:34] <swahili> Q: I've got a plugin that listens to events touch click drag, etc. Unfortunately there's a case where there's a <div> element on top (the reason is designer request, having a image layer on top). I wonder if it's possible to map the event and send it to a different one ? Or just allow the event to bubble down or something ? Thanks
[09:12:52] <jackp10> hi everyone
[09:13:01] <robertmaxrees> swahili https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events
[09:13:07] <jackp10> I wonder if someone has worked with dataTables plugin already
[09:13:20] <jackp10> I have having trouble in placing some elements using the sDom
[09:13:28] <robertmaxrees> jackp10 some people here has worked with it, but don't expect us to be able to help much.
[09:13:34] <swahili> robertmaxrees: oh interesting : ) Thanks for sharing, didn't remember that one!
[09:14:10] <decx> it's pretty new
[09:14:27] <robertmaxrees> very true.
[09:14:31] <decx> ie11
[09:14:35] <robertmaxrees> if old IE is your thing.
[09:14:39] <robertmaxrees> not going to work.
[09:14:42] <jackp10> I had read about the meaning of sDom, but I am unable to understand how to place pagination for example inside a header cell I have created
[09:15:33] <robertmaxrees> jackp10 you'll probably have a lot more luck getting help on their forums.
[09:16:24] <mack25> using jquery mobile, is it possible to link the listview values inside of my panel to change the content on the main page? if so, how can i do that?
[09:16:44] <jackp10> robertmaxrees, thanks. I just wanted to see if someone was able to help here as this is way faster then a forum.
[09:17:17] <robertmaxrees> jackp10 well aware of the speed - we get people in here all the time looking for supoort.
[09:18:01] <robertmaxrees> figured i'd point out that this really isn't a great place to get support for datatables since we're rarely able to help :)
[09:23:14] <kamikaz3> I am trying to load elements into a div from ajax and for that div I have a jquery .on() function that will run on scroll. But .on() doesn't seem to respond
[09:23:21] <kamikaz3> is there a way around it ?
[09:23:33] <robertmaxrees> kamikaz3 can you share your code in a fixee?
[09:23:40] <kamikaz3> 1 min robertmaxrees
[09:24:27] <v0lksman> is there a way to tell where a function is loaded?  I'm reversing a site and they use .endlessScroll()  but I can tell where that is loaded
[09:24:42] <kamikaz3> heres a fixee http://fixee.org/paste/zpcgkpk/
[09:25:00] <kamikaz3> its just an on scroll event
[09:25:04] <robertmaxrees> kamikaz3 what kind of element is #latest-feed?
[09:25:05] <kamikaz3> for the DIV ID
[09:25:08] <robertmaxrees> does it have a scroll bar?
[09:25:35] <kamikaz3> it doesnt have a scroll bar when the page loads
[09:25:48] <robertmaxrees> but it gets one later?
[09:25:51] <kamikaz3> yes
[09:26:39] <kamikaz3> I am guessing that is what confuses the on() method
[09:26:45] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:26:47] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't.
[09:26:56] <robertmaxrees> as long as you're not removing the element, that doesn't matter
[09:26:59] <uskerine> how can I say, everything but "input" and "textareas"
[09:26:59] <uskerine> ?
[09:27:56] <robertmaxrees> kamikaz3 something tells me you're binding to the wrong element - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lju7k47a/
[09:28:10] <robertmaxrees> you don't want the content of the element that's scrolling, but the element that has the scroll on it.
[09:29:24] <uskerine> $(":not(input, textarea)")
[09:29:27] <uskerine> is that correct?
[09:30:04] <kamikaz3> robertmaxrees let me check 1 min
[09:30:23] <robertmaxrees> uskerine Did You Tryâ„¢?
[09:31:23] <uskerine> I am doing it, but as in scientific method, I would like to have only one unknown variable so that's why I am asking for confirmation :)
[09:31:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?  there's absolutely no harm in trying things in your code..
[09:33:19] <uskerine> yeah but I am trying to do something weird and I need to use the right selector
[09:33:22] <uskerine> I think that does not work
[09:37:48] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pckhp7r5/ looks to work just fine.
[09:41:34] <uskerine> mm
[09:41:50] <uskerine> thanks, I will check everything, this is getting me crazy

[09:49:45] <SOSA_> Question guys
[09:50:09] <SOSA_> Should ALL form elements be in a form, even though the form action is going to be emptied and not maniplated via js?
[10:06:50] <uskerine> is it possible to save current tabIndex position and then restore it?
[10:08:17] <robertmaxrees> !g javascript get tabIndex
[10:08:18] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Getting, setting, and removing tabindex values with JavaScript â†’ http://fluidproject.org/blog/2008/01/09/getting-setting-and-removing-tabindex-values-with-javascript/
[10:08:48] <robertmaxrees> tons of resources out there :)
[10:09:39] <Velveeta> just use ng-tabindex... i think if you do ng-anything, it magics the code together or something
[10:09:49] <uskerine> I've already been there, what I would like is to get the current value used within the page and then assign the next tabindex
[10:10:03] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta that only works with angular.
[10:10:06] <Velveeta> $(target).attr('tabindex') ?
[10:10:17] <Velveeta> robertmaxrees: no no, i think it just works everywhere, even in flash
[10:10:27] <Velveeta> that's why it's magic
[10:10:37] <uskerine> I have a properly tabindex numbered datatables, but I am handling focusout events which updates other elements in the row, when I do that, the TAB key does not work fine, it seems that updating other part of the row moves the focus elsewhere
[10:10:38] <robertmaxrees> ng prefixed attributesare angular i though...
[10:10:44] <Velveeta> they are :D
[10:11:05] <robertmaxrees> if he's not using angular, why would use use ng-tabindex then?
[10:11:12] <uskerine> I am not using angular
[10:11:13] * Velveeta facepalms.
[10:11:21] <Velveeta> apparently my joke was a swing and a miss...
[10:11:36] <robertmaxrees> i am lost D:
[10:12:13] <robertmaxrees> uskerine document.activeElement will get the current active control.
[10:12:24] <uskerine> let's try with that
[10:12:44] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3995524/change-document-activeelement-programmatically-in-javascript will tell you how to set the tabindex.
[10:13:34] <stack> hi, is that possible to hook all ajax requests to display a loader gif somewhere?
[10:14:03] <robertmaxrees> stack sure is: http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/
[10:14:34] <uskerine> I'll check that too thanks robertmaxrees
[10:14:45] <stack> robertmaxrees: ajaxStart and ajaxStop could be the answer, thanks
[10:14:47] <robertmaxrees> uskerine the first link is getting, the second is setting.
[10:15:20] <uskerine> yeah the point is that, when user focusOut, how can I know if TAB was press?
[10:15:34] <uskerine> because if I don't know, I can't assume he did to force focus on next cell
[10:15:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:15:43] <Velveeta> i don't think you can get that info from the focusout event
[10:16:01] <robertmaxrees> bind an event listener for tab keypresses on those elements.
[10:16:06] <uskerine> I am handling a focusOut event which is breaking the regular tab (I suspect that it is because it updates other parts of the table)
[10:16:25] <uskerine> so user types something in a cell
[10:16:32] <Velveeta> how about you do a setTimeout(1) on your focusOut callback
[10:16:33] <uskerine> as soon as user leaves that cell, other cells are updated
[10:16:47] <Velveeta> that way the native tab finishes its work before your focus handler does any modifications
[10:16:53] <uskerine> but user might have been used the mouse or the TAB key
[10:17:04] <uskerine> that's a good idea
[10:18:54] <uskerine> I guess that I can not use alert to display current document.activeElement as it will bring focus elsewhere because of the alert, right?
[10:19:07] <robertmaxrees> you should be using console.log() for debugging anyway
[10:20:13] <uskerine> I know, but for some unknown -and probably weird- reason  I am a big fan of alerts
[10:20:28] <frank_o> Hi! Both mobile Chrome and Safari prevent media elements from being played without explicit user interaction. Hence, at this SoundCloud track, the user has to click "Play" twice in order to play: http://jsbin.com/cilof/1/edit
[10:20:29] <robertmaxrees> alerts halt execution and make your app not behave the way it would in the real world.
[10:20:32] <frank_o> Is there a way to simulate that 2nd click via JS though?
[10:21:07] <uskerine> the only good thing of alerts is that you won't leave one in production, as they are quite apparent
[10:21:40] <robertmaxrees> uskerine i'd disagree, and your linting process should take care of that anyway :)
[10:22:02] <robertmaxrees> frank_o your closest bet will be using .contents() on the iframe and then running a .trigger, but that assumes you can access cross-domain and that the iframe is using jquery events.
[10:22:33] <uskerine> I don't know what is a linting process, which migh explain why it won't :)
[10:22:52] <robertmaxrees> automatic code checking for syntax errors.
[10:23:08] <tw2113> automated QA
[10:23:14] <robertmaxrees> lots of editors support them.  you can even setup standalone setups for it.
[10:23:23] <robertmaxrees> *automated Code Review ;)
[10:24:21] <uskerine> I don't have that, it is manual QA
[10:24:35] <robertmaxrees> setup a linter and feel cool.
[10:24:36] <uskerine> I am using netbeans
[10:24:50] <robertmaxrees> http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/40893/jslint
[10:24:57] <uskerine> good to know, thanks
[10:25:12] <robertmaxrees> you can also setup node to do it.
[10:27:26] <banister> hiya, assumig i have this: h = $.parseHTML("<ul><li>Hello world!</li></ul>")     how would i get the <ul> element from it?
[10:27:33] <banister> or the <li> element
[10:28:55] <robertmaxrees> any particular reason you're using parseHTML?
[10:30:20] <banister> robertmaxrees is just using $("<ul><li>Hello world!</li></ul>")   better?
[10:30:28] <robertmaxrees> it'd certainly be easier.
[10:30:54] <robertmaxrees> $.parseHTML returns an array with a NodeList that's a little more awkward to use.
[10:31:33] <banister> robertmaxrees is there anything that $() can't do that $.parseHTML() can't do?
[10:31:40] <banister> can*
[10:32:08] <robertmaxrees> err, they serve two different purposes.
[10:32:30] <robertmaxrees> if you're creating elements using jquery, you generally use the element creation syntaxes provided through $()
[10:32:54] <robertmaxrees> that way you get all the benefits of jquery methods against that object.
[10:33:30] <banister> robertmaxrees is there an alias for the $("<ul></ul>") method? cos the $() method does a tonne of things, but i'm specifically interested in the behaviour where it returns DOM elements for a given html string so i can use jquery on it, and i need a way or referring to it/naming it in a document
[10:33:54] <robertmaxrees> banister "alias"?
[10:34:05] <robertmaxrees> because that's how you'd do exactly that.
[10:34:11] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vjjamvyc/
[10:34:25] <banister> robertmaxrees i know, but is there another method that does the same thing that has an actual name?
[10:34:57] <motaka2> what is the use of this function? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c9b36e47f8cc75b59f37
[10:35:03] <robertmaxrees> banister nope -> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery2
[10:35:49] <robertmaxrees> motaka2 that lets you get a list of properties as an array.
[10:35:53] <robertmaxrees> *property names
[10:36:35] <motaka2> robertmaxrees: Why it uses hasOwnProperty ?
[10:36:52] <frank_o> robertmaxrees: That doesn't sound too good. I reckon this is off the table then?
[10:37:11] <robertmaxrees> motaka2 because doing for...in loops on objects can include properties inherited from the prototype chain, which is generally not what you want.
[10:37:23] <robertmaxrees> frank_o might be.
[10:37:25] <motaka2> got that thanks
[10:37:40] <banister> robertmaxrees darn, seems this method is kind of messed up and inconsistent, it doesn't always have the same behaviour across differnet browsers, etc: ". During this process, some browsers filter out certain elements such as <html>, <title>, or <head> elements. As a result, the elements inserted may not be representative of the original string passed."
[10:37:59] <banister> robertmaxrees do you know of an HTML parser that is consistent across browsers?
[10:38:07] <robertmaxrees> banister $() is consisted 99% of the time.
[10:38:15] <robertmaxrees> what sorts of elements will you be creating?
[10:38:27] <robertmaxrees> because I use $() all the time without any cross-browser issues.
[10:39:03] <robertmaxrees> just so long as you're not creating entire documents with it, you're fine.
[10:39:14] <banister> robertmaxreesrob here though:  $("<head>hi</head><ul><li>Hello world!</li></ul>")   it strips out the <head>
[10:39:28] <robertmaxrees> banister first off, that's not valid syntax.
[10:39:35] <robertmaxrees> second off, you should never do anything like that.
[10:40:09] <robertmaxrees> some browsers strip out <head> tags because you can't shove a second one into the page.
[10:47:08] <frank_o> robertmaxrees: cool thanks
[11:12:09] <uskerine> How can this delegated event be delayed?   So It will be executed 500mseconds after the focusout event takes place    $('#fooTable tbody').on( 'focusout', 'input', function () {
[11:12:31] <lolmaus> uskerine: http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[11:12:35] <robertmaxrees> it can't.  you can wrap all your logic in your handler in a setTimeout.
[11:12:57] <robertmaxrees> .delay() assumes you have a queue setup.
[11:13:18] <uskerine> so I am forced to use setTimeout inside the delegated event function
[11:13:31] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[11:13:36] <robertmaxrees> you can't "delay" events.
[11:13:51] <robertmaxrees> well, i mean, you could hack it in, but that's not really a good idea imo.
[11:14:32] <uskerine> It is for the tab stuff, I will try to setup an event for the TAB key, and then delay the event for the focusOut and cross my fingers because it does not seem like a very clean programming technique
[11:14:53] <robertmaxrees> uskerine you're right - it's not a very clean technique.
[11:15:14] <robertmaxrees> i'd catpure all events, run .preventDefault() against the event object, and then explicitly do what you want instead.
[11:17:05] <uskerine> how would you capture all events, and what preventDefault does?
[11:17:55] <robertmaxrees> you'd setup an event binding on your respective elements that listens for any and all events you're interested in.  focus, keypress, input, click, etc.
[11:18:05] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to manually list out the ones you want.
[11:19:04] <robertmaxrees> you then pass the event object in your handler, so $(element).on('event', function(eventObject) { eventObject.preventDefault(); });
[11:19:33] <robertmaxrees> uskerine http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u6nefe9r/
[11:20:15] <uskerine> I'll try to diggest what you said, it seems like the way to go
[11:20:17] <uskerine> thanks
[11:20:19] <robertmaxrees> this is all covered at learn.jquery.com
[11:20:24] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/ is a great place to start.
[11:22:27] <uskerine> I'd really wish to be able to have slower pace and learn better what I use, unfortunatelly I am learning on the job
[11:23:03] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* you'll spend less time if you read the docs first, even if you're on the job.
[11:23:13] <robertmaxrees> you come in here with lots of basic questions pretty regularly.
[11:23:59] <uskerine> I know
[11:24:19] <robertmaxrees> you'll get stuff done a lot faster if you hit the docs first :)
[11:27:31] <robertmaxrees> uskerine you'll spend a lot less time in the long (and short!) run if you do a quick primer :)

[12:10:23] <FrEaKmAn_> hi all.. I'm trying to combine draggable and resizable plugins
[12:12:14] <FrEaKmAn_> this is my code
[12:12:15] <FrEaKmAn_> http://pastie.org/9564053
[12:12:39] <FrEaKmAn_> problem is that actually I attach resizable to .layer (simple 100px box), but I cannot resize
[12:12:55] <FrEaKmAn_> I think that draggable is preventing all propagation of events to children
[12:13:03] <FrEaKmAn_> so I can never fire resizable
[12:13:06] <FrEaKmAn_> what do you recommend?
[12:13:28] <P0RK> You would be much better suited using an actual sandbox rather than pastie. Try jsfiddle
[12:13:43] <FrEaKmAn_> you are right

[12:32:10] <Cork> (as the code doesn't run)
[12:32:40] <Cork> Bhiufgy: well to start with don't use event attributes
[12:32:44] <Cork> use event listeners
[12:33:04] <Kartagis> number format
[12:33:09] <Cork> secondly keydown and keypress is basially the same
[12:33:18] <Cork> except keypress is not supported in all browsers

[12:39:45] <Cork> Bhiufgy: also your key check forgets to check for numeric keys

[12:55:57] <Hacym> I currently have this code: http://pastebin.com/D1ksmivY which is working, except that it is hiding EVERYTHING without the data value portfolio-id... How can I only hide the ones that actually have that set?
[12:57:16] <robertmaxrees> how are you setting the data attribute values?
[12:57:17] <Bhiufgy> cork :doing like you example I get this error   :::    n.toFixed is not a function
[12:57:28] <robertmaxrees> Bhiufgy because n in your code isn't a number.
[12:57:37] <robertmaxrees> you need to parseFloat it.
[12:57:38] <Cork> Bhiufgy: you missed the parseFloat fix i added
[12:57:38] <Hacym> robertmaxrees, I am setting them in the html tag
[12:57:52] <Cork> Bhiufgy: input fields always returns a string
[12:58:02] <Cork> so you need to parse it to a float before fixing it
[12:58:43] <robertmaxrees> Hacym i'd need to see a more fleshed out example in like a fiddle.
[12:59:49] <robertmaxrees> also Hacym i'd suggest not selecting on data attributes.   select a class and then use .filter() to find the ones you need.
[13:00:20] <Hacym> is there a reason for that? performance? stability?
[13:01:02] <robertmaxrees> performance.
[13:01:02] <robertmaxrees> and and you should use .data() when setting data attributes via jquery, which doesn't update the markup.
[13:01:24] <robertmaxrees> actually, you should use data() when setting and reading
[13:30:27] <OnceMe> I have tipsy lib and this  $updates.delegate('.box', 'hover', function (event) { $('.metite').tipsy({gravity: 's'}); }); now when I do hover over 300 boxes, tipsy hover goes a little slower and slower on infinity scroll, any work around?

[13:31:05] <OnceMe> thats a paste and BillCriswell knows the answer
[13:31:11] <robertmaxrees> a more fleshed out example would be nice.
[13:31:13] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[13:34:58] <robertmaxrees> btw what version of jquery are you on?
[13:48:09] <robertmaxrees> welp[.
[14:18:28] <ericandrewlewis> triggering custom events on document is an antipattern, yes?
[14:19:01] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[14:19:40] <ericandrewlewis> care to expand?
[14:20:18] <robertmaxrees> depends on the use case.  if you just need to notify another function that something happened without much context or data, it can be an OK thing to do.
[14:20:36] <robertmaxrees> but if you need to lug around a lot of data or whatever, directly calling functions is a better strategy imo.
[14:20:59] <robertmaxrees> the nice thing about the event emitting concept is you can split your logic up over a lot of files and don't need to worry as much about scoping.
[14:42:12] <ericandrewlewis> robertmaxrees: cool. no cross-browser issues doing that though, right?
[14:42:42] <robertmaxrees> ericandrewlewis jquery is designed to make cross-browser event handling a-ok.  shouldn't be an issue.
[14:42:48] <ericandrewlewis> :)
[14:42:51] <ericandrewlewis> thank
[14:42:54] <ericandrewlewis> you
[14:42:58] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[14:45:57] <ronin> what book would you recommend for studying?
[14:46:01] <ronin> jquery
[14:46:51] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[14:46:57] <robertmaxrees> and javascript: the definitive guide
[15:10:43] <motaka2> can anyone please tell me why on this page< I dont get all ull and and lis displayed?  http://fa.noondreams.com/routes/
[15:11:31] <robertmaxrees> where is the code that displays them?
[15:12:33] <KarlJ> Hey all. im working on a resizable seating chart creator in jquery. Runs fine out of the box but when i resize the table im drawing on bigger you can not draw on the new squares. Heres a fiddle for referance, wondering if someone could help me? http://jsfiddle.net/o1z0uxj4/
[15:13:26] <KarlJ> oops, try http://jsfiddle.net/o1z0uxj4/1/
[15:15:37] <KarlJ> if im declaring a mousedown on a td in a table, and i add more tds to the table, do i need to redeclare the mousedown??
[15:15:44] <robertmaxrees> because your event listener isn't bound to those new elements.
[15:15:47] <robertmaxrees> use event delegationinstead/
[15:15:49] <motaka2> robertmaxrees: Where you talking to me?
[15:16:27] <robertmaxrees> motaka2 earlier, yes.
[15:16:39] <robertmaxrees> KarlJ so you'd do $("#grid-overlay").on('mousedown', 'td', function() {
[15:16:40] <motaka2> what do you mean my friend?
[15:16:58] <robertmaxrees> motaka2 where is the code that adds the uls and lis?
[15:17:12] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to dig through your page to find it :)
[15:17:28] <KarlJ> Thanks for replying robertmaxrees, i think im doing it this way so you can essentially 'paint' (drag) your mouse across the table without selecting
[15:17:44] <robertmaxrees> KarlJ that... doesn't make a difference.
[15:18:04] <motaka2> robertmaxrees: I dont understand you. The code producing ul and lis are in php. but if you check the source you will see the source is completely there. but it just shows one level
[15:18:21] <robertmaxrees> motaka2 so this isn't a javascript/jquery issue?
[15:18:38] <robertmaxrees> KarlJ $("#grid-overlay td").mousedown() is a shortcut for $("#grid-overlay td").on('mousedown'
[15:18:55] <motaka2> robertmaxrees: yes there. cause php produces the complete html code. but it seems that javascript messes it
[15:18:56] <robertmaxrees> your other listener is similar.
[15:19:09] <robertmaxrees> motaka2 what's the relevant jkavascript, then?
[15:19:40] <KarlJ> yes i get that. im giving it a shot.
[15:20:08] <robertmaxrees> KarlJ http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/o1z0uxj4/3/
[15:20:29] <motaka2> robertmaxrees: http://fa.noondreams.com/web/templates/filters/routes/simpletreemenu.php
[15:20:46] <robertmaxrees> okay, what part?
[15:20:48] <KarlJ> http://jsfiddle.net/o1z0uxj4/4/ yup that did the job! youre a lifesaver.
[15:21:12] <KarlJ> ah you can chain them together, even better.
[15:21:22] <robertmaxrees> KarlJ yep, you can do that.
[15:21:31] <motaka2> robertmaxrees: here is the css   http://fa.noondreams.com/web/templates/filters/routes/simpletree.php
[15:21:32] <KarlJ> Thanks for the help!
[15:21:34] <robertmaxrees> the issue is you can't bind to things that don't exist at time of binding.
[15:21:41] <motaka2> robertmaxrees: What part was for me?
[15:21:42] <KarlJ> I getcha
[15:22:11] <robertmaxrees> motaka2 erm, i'm not going to look through all of your js and css for you man.  have you tried narrowing it down at all?
[15:22:32] <motaka2> yes, it is very strange issue
[15:22:54] <robertmaxrees> btw you have a javascript error on pageload.
[15:26:07] <motaka2> robertmaxrees: thanks for your care I will sove it another night
[16:33:24] <cirenyc> When inside a checkbox's click event, how can I select all checked checkboxes not include the current one?
[16:33:46] <cirenyc> I've tried $("input...").not(this) to no avail.
[16:35:56] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0wxL209w/1/
[16:38:19] <cirenyc> robertmaxrees: okay, something else must be up.  thanks.
[16:40:17] <robertmaxrees> use the change event btw.\
[16:42:27] <cirenyc> robertmaxrees: oh okay.  I noticed that and changed it in your fiddle and it seemed to still behave as expected
[16:42:52] <robertmaxrees> sure, but "change" is technically the event you want anyway.
[16:42:54] <robertmaxrees> just fyi :)
[16:50:11] <cirenyc> robertmaxrees: thanks
[17:59:59] <jaclinuxhelp> is $.when(...) equivalent to the Promise.all(...) from newer browsers ?

[19:12:59] <acidjazz> whats hte sweet way again to check the inner div on a click event
[19:13:20] <xingped> if i have an <tr> element with onclick="thisfunc()" and i'm trying to get the 2nd child, why doesn't $(this).children(':nth-child(2)').html(); work?
[19:16:05] <xingped> $(':nth-child(2)', $(this)).html(); doesn't work either.
[20:11:22] <Dev0n> hey
[20:11:29] <Dev0n> is it possible to have an input box on focus all the time?
[20:11:35] <Dev0n> regardless of where the mouse is clicked
[20:15:43] <tw2113> you'd instantly ruin the usability of the rest of the page
[20:30:08] <SOSA_> *hopes this channel is alive
[20:30:41] <SOSA_> What is another way of doing a top nav using slide down and above content wtihout using position: absolute?
[20:32:37] <tw2113> it's been pretty dead since i logged on
[20:43:51] <acidjazz> so if i assign a variable in a .each
[20:44:03] <acidjazz> will i be able to access it inside a .promisee().done(function -> ?
[20:58:01] <uskerine> for an event that happens in the second element of the table, how can I capture the next element with name="f3"? http://jsfiddle.net/u6nefe9r/4/
[21:08:01] <uskerine> http://codebeautify.org/xmlviewer/a7a168  Is $(this) is the <input> element with name="foo2" under <td name="f2">, how do you select the next element with name="foo3"? -the one under <td name="f3">
[21:11:57] <shoky_> uskerine: $(this).closest('td').next().find('input')
[21:21:17] <uskerine> thanks!
[21:21:43] <uskerine> i used .next('td').children()  -I am sure that the children of the next 'td' is the one I want
[21:54:02] <xertion> See this JS Fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/CbESD/2/). How do I stop it from snapping to the right and left edges of the "drop"? I want to it to snap to the top and bottom edges, but not the left and right ones. As you can see its impossible to position the element in the center because of the snap.

[23:55:16] <lilsammy> Trying to make the logo div shrink down when user scrolls from the top, this seems to be firing fine as in the log is full of the "down", "up" but the animate isn't firing in FF seems to work properly in Chrome
[23:56:27] <Cork> lilsammy: body isn't the scrolling elements
[23:56:36] <lilsammy> was window but same issue
