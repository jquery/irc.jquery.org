[00:00:18] <Cork> iksik: if you don't know what the html is going to be like; how can you solve it with js?
[00:00:22] <iksik> it some kind of inspector which will mark important places in docx->html converted document saved in database
[00:00:27] <iksik> for example
[00:00:56] <iksik> Cork: well, it works with js, but it is buggy ;-P
[00:01:05] <Cork> iksik: and what prevents it from highlighting every parent?
[00:01:23] <Cork> you do hover #baz
[00:01:32] <Cork> so sure you can remove the :not selectors
[00:01:37] <iksik> Cork: e.stopPropagation
[00:01:39] <Cork> you will just get a bunch of extra outlines
[00:01:54] <Cork> that only works if your lucky
[00:02:12] <iksik> hmmm
[00:02:15] <Cork> as soon as you have a padding or something that will fail if the user moves the cursor slow enough
[00:02:21] <iksik> so... how it works in chrome inspector?
[00:02:32] <iksik> or firebug extension?
[00:03:13] <iksik> it's exactly same thing, but it works perfect on each element ;/
[00:04:12] <iksik> and..
[00:04:13] <iksik> http://slayeroffice.com/tools/modi/v2.0/modi_help.html
[00:04:28] <iksik> here... very nice 'inspector' which is using javascript
[00:04:40] <iksik> but it's code is to big and to complex for my needs
[00:05:27] <Cork> iksik: something like http://jsfiddle.net/GWpkw/5/
[00:06:10] <iksik> Cork: ;-DDDDD
[00:06:13] <iksik> it looks nice
[00:06:33] <Trisox> indeed mouse move ;)
[00:07:23] <iksik> hm, hm, hmm
[00:07:36] <iksik> ok, now there is still click problem, hmm
[00:07:48] <Cork> click problem?
[00:07:57] <Cork> if you click it should stick?
[00:08:09] <iksik> haha
[00:08:12] <iksik> no problem
[00:08:21] <Trisox> :p
[00:08:28] <iksik> http://jsfiddle.net/GWpkw/6/
[00:08:32] <Trisox> roflmao
[00:08:41] <Cork> iksik: btw you shouldn't use $('body *').bind/on
[00:08:46] <Cork> use delegate for that
[00:08:46] <iksik> hmmm, still problem ;/
[00:08:55] <iksik> e
[00:08:56] <iksik> eh
[00:09:00] <Cork> you shouldn't bind the click in the mouse move
[00:09:25] <iksik> ohh, right, it will be binded zylion times :D
[00:09:34] <iksik> i need coffe ;S
[00:10:16] <Hooloovoo> go get coffe!
[00:10:43] <Cork> iksik: should the tracking of hover stop if something is clicked?
[00:11:21] <iksik> Cork: only for clicked element
[00:11:47] <iksik> so it will be always green border after click
[00:13:07] <Cork> iksik: so something like http://jsfiddle.net/GWpkw/7/ ?
[00:13:50] <Trisox> awesome posem :D
[00:14:20] <iksik> http://jsfiddle.net/GWpkw/8/ hmm
[00:14:45] <Cork> iksik: http://jsfiddle.net/GWpkw/7/
[00:15:40] <iksik> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/GWpkw/9/
[00:15:40] <iksik> :D
[00:15:48] <iksik> nice
[00:16:01] <Cork> so it should allow to highlight multiple elements?
[00:16:09] <iksik> yup
[00:16:12] <Cork> ah
[00:16:27] <iksik> haha, perfect... thank You very much ;-)
[00:17:36] <Cork> iksik: btw this is event better http://jsfiddle.net/GWpkw/10/
[00:17:47] <Cork> no need to use delegate when you don't really want a selector
[00:18:31] <Cork> opps forgot to remove stopPropagate http://jsfiddle.net/GWpkw/11/
[00:19:45] <iksik> nice :DDD
[00:20:15] <iksik> hmm
[00:21:02] <iksik> just curious... is it possible to not allow 'hover' over clicked elements childrens?
[00:21:51] <Cork> if($(event.target).closest('.bar').length > 0) { return; }
[00:22:06] <Cork> opps if($(event.target).closest('.foo').length > 0) { return; }
[00:22:18] <Cork> i leave it up to you to figure out where to put it :)
[00:22:34] <iksik> great ;D
[00:22:39] <iksik> it works [;
[00:27:23] <iksik> uh, still not perfect with clicking it is getting to complex with simple click/toggleClass rules
[00:29:41] <Cork> iksik: what do you mean?
[00:31:07] <iksik> ok, http://jsfiddle.net/GWpkw/12/ - last thing i think... when You click on 'body' - at the bottom, to highligh most parent element, You can't highlight anything inside (which is perfect) but You still can click there
[00:35:11] <Mambobos> hi everyone... havn't used irc for 10 years, little bit of nostalgia : )
[00:35:22] <Mambobos> well, maybe 15 then..
[00:36:09] <litenull> same here, last active usage in 2003 :)
[00:37:07] <Mambobos> i would like to report a missing file in the themes for 1.10, is this the right place to do it?
[00:43:07] <vlad_starkov> Question: does anyone know, when I call .focus() method, why 'focus' event can't be called?
[00:43:41] <Mambobos> please paste your row
[00:44:51] <vlad_starkov> https://gist.github.com/4653972
[00:46:23] <vlad_starkov> Mambobos: probably it requires element to be visible?
[00:47:10] <vlad_starkov> Mambobos: it worked for me on jQuery 1.8.6, on 1.9.0 it does not
[00:47:28] <iksik> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/GWpkw/15/ - final solution ;-)
[00:48:12] <Cork> ah
[00:52:27] <vlad_starkov> Mambobos: any thoughts?
[00:57:03] <Cork> vlad_starkov: you'r binding the event there doesn't you?
[00:57:14] <Cork> or what is sinon.spy() return?
[00:57:52] * Cork nods
[00:58:00] <vlad_starkov> Cork: I'm checking focus event. It should be triggered, but for some reason it does not.
[00:58:12] <Cork> checking?
[00:58:28] <Cork> .focus(variable) binds an event, focus() triggers
[00:58:33] <Cork> the trigger doesn't take an argument
[01:01:17] <vlad_starkov> Cork: the 'focus' or 'focusin' event should be triggered on .focus() call. So .focus() is calling from @view.clearInputValue()
[01:03:07] <Cork> vlad_starkov: ok, so the focus call happens outside the code snippet?
[01:03:30] <vlad_starkov> Cork: yepp
[01:03:44] <Cork> and spy is a function generated by sinon.spy() ?
[01:05:44] <vlad_starkov> Cork: yepp
[01:06:06] <Cork> have you tried reproducing it with a simple testcase?
[01:06:11] <vlad_starkov> Spy is just regular test spy that helps to trace calls of methods
[01:06:15] <Cork> when all the logic you have there removed?
[01:06:30] <vlad_starkov> or 'methods calls' (my english sorry)
[01:06:43] <vlad_starkov> Cork: what do you mena?
[01:07:19] <Cork> vlad_starkov: ex. in jsfiddle, reproduce the basics of what your trying to do, and then scale down/up depending on if it fails or not
[01:07:51] <Cork> if it still fails, remove extra logic; if it succeeds, import logic from your page
[01:08:27] <Cork> a start point would be to just bind a focus listener through pure jquery on a similar dom structure, and then try to trigger it
[01:11:10] <vlad_starkov> Cork: the point is that I use specific test suite: Mocha+Chai+Sinon. So the DOM structure can have differences, because when you test JS in Mocha it does not show your actual page. Furthermore I use Backbone+Chaplin MVC framework there. So that it is quite complicated to implement test suite in JsFiddle.
[01:11:46] <Cork> vlad_starkov: yes, and thats why you should try to reproduce the problem with a smaller stack
[01:12:01] <Cork> find a case that fails, and try to reproduce it
[01:12:19] <vlad_starkov> Cork: the point is it works perfect in production, just the test suite fails. At that it was working on jQuery 1.8.6 and stopped working after I updated jQuery to 1.9.0.
[01:12:21] <Cork> if you have thick dependency libs you can't be sure what happens
[01:12:36] <vlad_starkov> Cork: I see.
[01:12:39] <Cork> vlad_starkov: cause 1.9 is a major update yes
[01:13:00] <Cork> so the lib might be doing something it shouldn't or there might be a bug in 1.9
[01:13:29] <Cork> what causes it can't be told before the stack is reduced to something that can actually be looked at
[01:15:40] <vlad_starkov> Cork: I think it will take too much time to reproduce the issue by adding step by step the logic fro my app. For this time I prefer to skip this issue. If it it will appear again in another place I'll quote a time and will try to reproduce it. Please don't think that you wasted your time for me for nothing. I appreciate your help!
[01:16:01] <Cork> vlad_starkov: hmm there might be another thing to test
[01:16:16] <Cork> you could try adding the migration library and see if that makes it work again
[01:16:43] <Cork> if that happens you know your app use removed features (thats been deprecated for a while)
[01:18:36] <vlad_starkov> Cork: I added migration library, but as I remember now it had some issues, don't remember what it was exactly and what was the reason of those issues (not actually sure that the cause was a migration lib). I just can say, that I cut migration library just to $.browser hash.
[01:19:07] <Cork> vlad_starkov: ya, but check the console
[01:19:23] <Cork> the migration lib will write a warning there if you use something thats been removed
[01:19:27] <vlad_starkov> Cork: console is always open. nothing there.
[01:19:32] <Cork> it might make it simpler to find
[01:19:33] <Cork> ah
[01:20:25] <vlad_starkov> Cork: Thanks for help! I'll continue write my tests :-)
[01:20:36] <Cork> good luck
[01:20:55] <litenull> Hello. I have a question. Is the .toggle onclick(fn, fn) event removed completely from jQuery ? Or is there some other way to do the exact stuff ?
[01:21:50] <Cork> litenull: its removed
[01:22:04] <Cork> litenull: you would have to handle the state your self
[01:22:12] <Cork> ex. though adding a class or a .data value
[01:22:23] <litenull> Thanks
[01:23:07] <litenull> :/
[01:23:39] <Cork> litenull: it shouldn't be that hard to do
[01:26:13] <litenull> No, it shouldnt be. But in a production process there's no time :) i'll find a simple way, thanks
[01:29:22] <Cork> litenull: $(target').on('click', function() { var state = $this).data('state'); if(state === undefined || state > 5) { state = 0; }; switch(state) { case 0: case 1: case 2: case 3: case 4: case 5: }; $(this).data('state', ++state); });
[01:33:03] <litenull> Cork: Thanks for this :) Love you :D
[01:33:13] <Cork> np :)
[01:41:13] <theBrettman> if I want to do something anytime pagebeforecreate fires, I can use $(document).on("pagebeforecreate", function(){}); ?
[01:42:00] <jomofcw> Hello !
[01:42:08] <theBrettman> and will it comflict if I delegate the same event on other pages?
[01:42:48] <Cork> theBrettman: thats not a delegated event listener; and as far as i can tell that should work; and as long as you don't return false it should work fine
[01:42:55] <jomofcw> I would like to "fix" a button at the bottom of the screen, but I don't want it to "go down" more than X pixel from the top of an element. How can I do that easily please ?
[01:44:17] <Cork> you would have to move it on scroll and stop moving it if window.scrollTop > $(elm).offset().top + X
[01:44:46] <theBrettman> and I should use pagebeforecreate for initializing $.mobile.page.prototype.options.addBackBtn?
[01:45:24] <Cork> donno, but i think they recommend to use pageinit if you want the page transformation to have happened first
[01:45:53] <Cork> (i am no jquery-mobile expert in any form of the word)
[01:46:07] <theBrettman> lol. I don't know when to use it either. docs don't say
[01:46:12] <Trisox> o/
[01:46:23] <Trisox> \\o
[01:46:32] <Cork> theBrettman: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html
[01:46:50] <Cork> its stated fairly clearly there
[01:47:25] <theBrettman> ok
[01:48:52] <theBrettman> i thought live was replaced with on?
[01:51:02] <theBrettman> what's difference between $('#page').live('event', function(){...}); and $(document).delegate('#page', 'event', function(){...});?
[01:51:30] <Cork> theBrettman: live is deprecated, in a few versions and removed in 1.9
[01:51:43] <Cork> and delegate is faster and cleaner
[01:51:46] <theBrettman> why they use it in the docs then? lol
[01:51:59] <Cork> don't ask me
[01:52:00] <theBrettman> under pageinit they use live
[01:52:22] <Cork> live was an old plugin idea, that just got merged into jquery
[01:52:39] <Cork> but it has some serous flaws in its syntax
[01:53:12] <theBrettman> when would i use delegate over on?
[01:53:26] <Cork> delegate over bind
[01:53:34] <Cork> on is a combination function that can do both
[01:53:48] <the_dark_knight> Hi, I have a div with id = 'fixedInfoWidget'. I want to refresh this after action on button "save". Also I have save() method in .js. So how do I refresh that div. I am able to fadeIn and fadeOut that div but not able to reload it?
[01:53:57] <theBrettman> i guess on replaces bind too
[01:54:08] <Cork> $(parent).delegate('selector', 'event') === $(parent).on('event', 'selector')
[01:54:33] <Cork> theBrettman: delegate and bind won't go anywhere, but ya, you can move them all to on if you like
[01:54:58] <Cork> theBrettman: delegate should be used when the targeting element isn't pressent in the page when you bind the event listener
[01:55:07] <Cork> or if you want to bind many elements with the same selector
[01:55:11] <theBrettman> I'm sure we had that convo before. it just confuses me that anyone uses anything other than on, lol
[01:55:20] <theBrettman> I see
[01:55:47] <Cork> theBrettman: well bind and delegate is more expressive, so it reduces the risk of "missing" what it does
[01:55:54] <Cork> though that is fairly minor problem
[01:56:03] <theBrettman> but bind is also faster?
[01:56:10] <theBrettman> than on?
[01:56:17] <Cork> bind and delegate runs on now days
[01:56:22] <Cork> so no no speed difference
[01:56:44] <Cork> it really doesn't matter if you use bind/delegate or on
[01:56:48] <Cork> just don't use live ;)
[01:57:19] <theBrettman> live doesn't require a parent selector I guess
[01:57:26] <Cork> it does
[01:57:31] <Cork> it just doesn't show it to you
[01:58:23] <theBrettman> I noticed it makes a copy of my home page which I hate...
[01:58:33] <theBrettman> two copies of the same dang page, lol
[01:58:44] <theBrettman> I want home to load each time though
[01:58:54] <foobar321> How to create already checked box in jquerymobile? I was trying with checked="checked" and checked="true"
[01:59:05] <foobar321> and it does not work
[01:59:11] <Cork> $('selector').live searches the dom for 'selector'; then throws away the result and do $(document).bind('event', function(event) { if(!$('selector').has(event.target)) { return; } /* run your code */ })
[01:59:35] <theBrettman> foobar321: maybe that can be done in init
[01:59:48] <Cork> damn loads of jquery mobile questions today >_>
[02:00:07] <foobar321> Is there better channel for jquerymobile ?
[02:00:11] <Cork> nope
[02:00:17] <theBrettman> you're going to get good with mobile whether you want to or not, lol
[02:00:35] <Cork> heh i don't use it my self, i find it useless
[02:00:43] <theBrettman> I'm glad you're here. At least you know something, lol.
[02:01:16] <theBrettman> I think it's less config. do you just use straight jquery and jquery-ui for mobile?
[02:01:47] <Cork> i use straight jquery + jquery-ui core + jquery ui slider
[02:01:53] <Cork> rest is plain html + css
[02:01:56] <theBrettman> data attr do most the work but can't do everything with them
[02:02:13] <theBrettman> so you don't like the page plugin or?
[02:02:16] <Cork> my biggest problem with it is that it doesn't solve toolbars
[02:02:38] <Cork> it messes with page loads in a way i don't like
[02:02:49] <Cork> it doesn't solve the problem i find so i have to solve them anyway
[02:02:50] <theBrettman> my crap phone can't run it well
[02:02:53] <Cork> so... why use it?
[02:03:00] <theBrettman> the header and footer get screwed up
[02:03:08] * Cork nods
[02:03:08] <theBrettman> but any decent phone seems to have no problem
[02:03:11] <Cork> exactly :D
[02:03:21] <theBrettman> how do I fix that?
[02:03:28] <Cork> loads of hacks
[02:03:30] <theBrettman> I know if I tap it once, they change mode
[02:03:39] <theBrettman> then they don't get stuck, lol
[02:03:41] <Cork> ya, they went the easy way
[02:04:06] <theBrettman> but no average user will figure that out, lol
[02:04:20] <Cork> its mostly cause iphone and older (anything but the absolute newest) android mobile browser sucks
[02:04:37] <Cork> and i REALLY mean S-U-C-K
[02:04:50] <theBrettman> oh I know this, lol
[02:05:03] <relipse> bid on this: https://www.elance.com/job/37261631/proposals
[02:05:19] <Cork> i find it depressing that they've been doing it longer then firefox; but firefox is better them on the mobile hands down
[02:05:41] <Cork> opera is ok, has its bugs but not as bad as iphone or android
[02:05:54] <Cork> and mobile chrome is ok too
[02:06:06] <theBrettman> android don't use chrome?
[02:06:10] <Cork> not that it matters much though as most android users are still on 2.3
[02:06:21] <theBrettman> yep, I have 2.3
[02:06:27] <Cork> theBrettman: it was released as an app just resently
[02:06:52] <Cork> and no the old one was unnamed webkit based browser
[02:07:00] <theBrettman> I guess Firefox is making a mobile OS?
[02:07:03] <Cork> that has gotten very little love from google
[02:07:12] <Cork> that too
[02:07:23] <Cork> but long before that they did the android app
[02:07:28] <theBrettman> they can't even make a browser right, why they gonna make an OS? lol
[02:07:44] <theBrettman> FF still memory leaks like a seive!
[02:07:54] <Cork> theBrettman: test the mobile firefox before you judge it
[02:08:06] <Cork> theBrettman: when did you test that last?
[02:08:13] <theBrettman> like every day
[02:08:20] <Cork> mozilla has been HARD at work on that for the last year
[02:08:24] <theBrettman> playing my game and it constantly adds up the memory
[02:08:32] <Cork> and now days its actually quite tight unless you use extensions
[02:08:42] <theBrettman> yeah, if you close a tab, it supposedly reclaims memory
[02:09:02] <theBrettman> I have a macbook with only 2GB and all I do is run a game script all day and it can't handle it
[02:09:02] <Cork> uh. a page using memory != leak
[02:09:08] <theBrettman> core 2 duo too!
[02:09:09] <Cork> a leak means loss of control over it
[02:09:38] <theBrettman> well I play the game in chrome on the same computer with no problems
[02:09:56] <theBrettman> only problem, the script for the game in chrome hasn't been updated and isn't working
[02:10:05] <theBrettman> so I'm forced to use FF
[02:10:08] <Cork> theBrettman: might be that the page produces more garbage then the gc gets time to collect
[02:10:13] <Beam> how do i pass a parameter to a callback?
[02:10:35] <Cork> chromes gc is a lot better then what firefox has right now
[02:10:44] <Cork> but they'r working on that
[02:10:55] <Cork> Beam: could you be a bit more specific?
[02:11:08] <Beam> so $('li').each(function () { var x = this; $.post('url','data',function(result) { ... can i access 'x' here? }); });
[02:11:19] <Cork> yes
[02:11:25] <relipse> bid on this: https://www.elance.com/r/jobs/q-cworklog/
[02:11:27] <Beam> i assume since each() x isn't saved?
[02:11:35] <Cork> warning though all the li post will come back aprox at the same time
[02:11:45] <Cork> Beam: its in the each scope
[02:11:50] <Industrial> If I call render, then inject, then render my DOM nodes are not updated. why? https://gist.github.com/8b07a41e6deb434630db/29755178600b468be1ab6997a10f3246154d1e67
[02:11:50] <Beam> ok
[02:12:06] <Beam> i once had some scope problems with jquery, but forgot now what it was
[02:12:09] <Cork> Beam: but as its async all the callbacks will trigger after the loop ends
[02:12:15] <Industrial> I would expect the second render to update some dom node values.
[02:12:40] <Cork> Beam: so you will loop the x number of li elements queue a post; end the loop, end the parent function
[02:12:52] <Cork> then the post happen as fast as the browser allows
[02:12:59] <Cork> and then the complete functions is called
[02:13:10] <Cork> s/is/are/
[02:15:22] <Pitel_IPEX> can I get index of clicked item in list, so I know user clicked on 3rd list item?
[02:15:39] <Cork> Pitel_IPEX: .index()
[02:15:59] <Whirl3d_> does anyone know how to shut jsfiddle up? I can't see my own logs because of all the diagnostic crap from the fiddle.
[02:16:07] <Cork> it will give you what number in the child list of the parent it is
[02:16:15] <the_dark_knight> Hi, I have a div with id = 'fixedInfoWidget'. I want to refresh this after action on button "save". Also I have save() method in .js. So how do I refresh that div. I am able to fadeIn and fadeOut that div but not able to reload it?
[02:16:46] <Cork> the_dark_knight: reload it from what?
[02:17:02] <Cork> you can't really "refresh" html you need to replace the dom content
[02:17:26] <theBrettman> so if I'm trying to change addBackBtn to true, should I use pageinit or mobileinit?
[02:17:28] <Cork> so the server needs to send you the new fragment and you then have to take that and replace the specific element
[02:17:38] <Cork> theBrettman: no clue

[02:34:44] <foobar321> Is it possible at all to create checked check-box in jquery mobile ?
[02:34:54] <foobar321> I mean not create using javascript
[02:35:01] <foobar321> eJust create in HTML
[02:36:02] <JSM87> Hi guys, does anyone know of  a good Carousel that can scroll up, not left/right
[02:36:28] <tlkr> foobar checked="checked" ?
[02:36:36] <tlkr> foobar321 *
[02:36:45] <foobar321> tlkr: Is not working :/
[02:38:19] <tlkr> foobar321, i suspect something else is affecting the checkbox then because that's how you check a checkbox.
[02:38:33] <tlkr> as my complicated example demonstrates: http://jsfiddle.net/Tqaa9/
[02:38:39] <Nebros> Hi all, my ajax program want work, can you please give me my brain back? i need the concentration to find the bug! :P
[02:38:54] <marcules> Mahlezeit
[02:38:56] <foobar321> tlkr: Or can you post a fiddle? Is it possible to put somewhere snippets  with jquerymobile
[02:39:11] <Nebros> hallo marcules :D
[02:40:08] <foobar321> Nerbos: I think that you left it in your rubber duck
[02:40:26] <marcules> hi there Nebros :D
[02:40:47] <foobar321> tlkr: Yeah I thought that this one will work with jquerymobile as well. Do you know any site to paste code and see results with jquerymobile included?
[02:41:06] <Nebros> hmm, ok, i will search there xD
[02:42:04] <tlkr> foobar321, you are trying to check a checkbox without javascript using jquerymobile? That doesn't make sense in itself.
[02:42:22] <tlkr> a mobile browser is still a browser that adheres to HTML standards.
[02:45:17] <DJDan> $("#surveytimerstart").text - new Date();   it seems to say NaN..... how do i convert the div text to be a number?

[02:46:03] <tlkr> parseInt DJDan
[02:46:23] <Hooloovoo> +$("#surveytimerstart").text - new Date.getTime()
[02:46:27] <Hooloovoo> something like that?
[02:46:41] <Hooloovoo> new Date()*
[02:46:58] <Hooloovoo> also it might return the timestamp on creation. not sure.

[02:51:59] <litenull> Guys I have a question. I'm using nextUntil,prevUntil to add a class to the current row in a table. On a browser it works fine, but on a mobile device it takes 1 sec. I'm using the addClass method to color the row. Any speed tips ?
[02:54:38] <Anthony_> Hi guys, anyone around?
[02:55:20] <Anthony_> Hi guys, anyone around?
[02:55:52] <tlkr> just ask your question Anthony_ and someone may answer it.
[02:56:11] <Anthony_> Cool
[02:56:30] <Anthony_> Having trouble getting plugin to register - https://github.com/avanderhoorn/jQueryUriTemplates/blob/v1.0/uritemplate.jquery.json
[02:57:26] <Anthony_> I have the webhook setup and I've validated the manifest, but its not showing up (I've also triggered the test of the webhook in github)
[03:13:35] <theBrettman> is there some fuller docs on jquery mobile? there's not really any reference on the properties to set
[03:29:22] <foobar321> tlkr: It turned out that checked='true' works. Just firefox remembers previous (unchecked) setting
[03:29:44] <g0bl1n> I have 20 divs to which I need the user the be able to change a color, via a jQuery colorpicker (spectrum). Should I attach the colorpicker to each div, or should I bind only one, when the user presses a button ?
[03:30:02] <foobar321> tlkr: anyway thnx for help :)
[03:30:02] <g0bl1n> performance wise
[03:30:46] <foobar321> g0blin: my guess would be to use one. But you have to meausre it
[04:01:43] <aewtawtaw> $(document).ready(function(){ ... }); waits til DOM is created right?
[04:01:56] <aewtawtaw> So do you only need to use that if you put your script in the <head>?
[04:02:15] <aewtawtaw> would a self invoking anon func be enough if you link to the scipt at the end of the body?
[04:02:39] <philhutchinson> should be
[04:03:15] <aewtawtaw> so why use $(document).ready(function(){ ... }); at all?
[04:03:31] <aewtawtaw> just in case people are ignorant and still put the script in the head like it used to be common?
[04:04:34] <quicksilver> because in general you want to wait until the DOM is laid out
[04:04:40] <quicksilver> in case you depend on widths/heights/positions of objects
[04:04:59] <aewtawtaw> wouldn't putting the script at the end of the body do that?
[04:05:20] <quicksilver> no.
[04:06:12] <aewtawtaw> I thought DOM and page loads top-down so by the time script is read DOM would be laid out
[04:10:22] <Cork> aewtawtaw: yes if you put the script in body it will even break in ie
[04:10:34] <Cork> aewtawtaw: so ready should only be used in head
[04:12:09] <aewtawtaw> Cork: So why put it in head and use ready at all instead of putting script at the end of the body?
[04:12:50] <Cork> aewtawtaw: if the file needs to be loaded events starts firing on the page
[04:13:03] <juria_roberts> how do i solve this error p.easing[this.easing] is not a function ?
[04:13:50] <Cork> juria_roberts: what file and line number should help
[04:13:58] <Cork> else it doesn't mean anything
[04:14:43] <HankHendrix> anyone good with regex?
[04:15:00] <juria_roberts> Cork: jquery.js 8915
[04:15:04] <Cork> HankHendrix: don't ask for ppl, ask questions
[04:15:18] <Cork> juria_roberts: what version
[04:15:25] <Cork> and is it minimized?
[04:15:36] <Cork> uh... scratch the last one
[04:15:49] <juria_roberts> Cork: 1.8.2
[04:15:50] <HankHendrix>  how can I strip the file extension out of this regex? ([^/]+[jpg])
[04:16:15] <HankHendrix> I'm getting "filename.jpg" and I want "filename"
[04:18:09] <Cork> juria_roberts: do you have the full jquery library or a stripped down one=
[04:18:11] <Cork> *?
[04:18:45] <juria_roberts> Cork: im using this http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.js & after that http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.2/jquery-ui.min.js
[04:19:02] <Cork> js> "filename.jpg".replace(/\.jpg$/, '')
[04:19:05] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[04:19:12] * Cork hits b-ot 
[04:19:18] <Cork> js> print("filename.jpg".replace(/\.jpg$/, ''))
[04:19:20] <b-ot> Cork: filename
[04:19:54] <Cork> juria_roberts: uh, you load jquery twice??
[04:20:12] <juria_roberts> Cork: no jquery once and then the ui
[04:20:19] <Cork> ah >_<
[04:20:51] <Happzz> hi, what js (or jquery) variable represents the URI of the current page
[04:21:08] <Happzz> like google.com/path/to/file?whatever=1&x=5 then represent HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH
[04:21:12] <Cork> juria_roberts: what animation are you trying to use?
[04:21:17] <Happzz> er - like google.com/path/to/file?whatever=1&x=5 then represent path/to/file?whatever=1&x=5
[04:21:25] <juria_roberts> Cork: im using a multi select
[04:21:26] <Cork> juria_roberts: sorry effect
[04:21:44] <Cork> jquery only include linear and swing
[04:21:54] <Cork> if you need another one you need the full easing library
[04:23:34] <juria_roberts> Cork: I included this <script src="http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/jquery.easing.1.3.js"></script> after jquery and still gives me same error
[04:23:56] <Cork> juria_roberts: do you know what effect is trying to be used?
[04:24:13] <juria_roberts> Cork: No
[04:24:16] <Cork> :s
[04:25:12] <Cork> juria_roberts: and if you add http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/jquery.easing.compatibility.js ?
[04:25:34] <Cork> (that isn't a cdn so you need to use it from another place if you need it)
[04:25:35] <juria_roberts> Cork: ok will try that now
[04:25:36] <mcspeccy> I wonder if anyone can help me, I'm using jquery ui and draggable and slider, the slider is controlling the size of the image, and that is working fine, but, when scaling back down, I need the image to snap to edges, and I can't seem to get it to work. The image skips straight past the top edge and becomes smaller than the container.
[04:25:36] <mcspeccy> Code is here — http://jsbin.com/egivat/5/edit
[04:25:58] <Cork> HankHendrix: did you catch the answer?
[04:27:19] <juria_roberts> Cork: It doesnt work
[04:27:28] <Cork> hmm so its not that...
[04:27:52] <Cork> juria_roberts: only idea i have is to add a console.log(this.easing) before that line
[04:27:59] <Cork> and then check what value it is when it crashes
[04:28:09] <juria_roberts> Cork: ok
[04:28:59] <khurram> hi guys
[04:29:10] <khurram> has anyone used underscore templates with jquery here ?
[04:34:58] <bambanx> Hi
[04:36:56] <bambanx> Guys anyonw know a jquery framework for make aninations with timeline and images?
[04:38:08] <kerozene> bambanx: not jquery but have you looked at greensock?
[04:38:12] <juria_roberts> Cork: this.easing has a value of 400
[04:38:23] <Cork> O_o
[04:38:43] <bambanx> I am reading now about it. I dont like flash
[04:38:45] <Cork> sounds like duration is passed as easing for some reason
[04:38:51] <bambanx> Thanks kerosene
[04:39:07] <juria_roberts> Cork: its always 400
[04:39:08] <bambanx> I amsearching more
[04:39:22] <Cork> juria_roberts: and just one of the times it fails; or it fails all the time?
[04:39:37] <juria_roberts> Cork: fails all the time
[04:40:11] <Cork> ok, so what your using to generate the animation is broken
[04:40:19] <Cork> it sends values in the wrong order
[04:41:07] <Cork> can't really say what fails though, cause i would have to dig through the entire structure to tell
[04:41:30] <Cork> but jquery fails cause it gets the duration value in the easing variable
[04:41:49] <Cork> never ever seen that happen my self so no sure what could cause that
[04:42:00] <Cork> *so not
[04:42:40] <juria_roberts> Cork: i hardcoded this.easing = 'def';
[04:42:52] <Cork> <_<'
[04:42:55] <juria_roberts> Cork: jQuery.easing['def'] is easeOutQuad
[04:43:11] <Cork> you should find the cause instaead
[04:43:11] <juria_roberts> Cork: its still coming as undefined
[04:43:21] <Cork> *instead
[04:43:29] <juria_roberts> Cork: that will take too much time
[04:43:38] <juria_roberts> Cork: ill have to go through the ui code
[04:43:49] <Cork> juria_roberts: console.log(Object.keys(jQuery.easing).length)
[04:44:02] <Cork> juria_roberts: i doubt its jquery or jquery ui
[04:47:05] <bambanx> Kerosene andnonly with jquery for and anomation of like 30 minutes can be works well? T have a lot of images
[04:47:19] <Cork> juria_roberts: btw are you sure jquery-ui 1.8.2 is compatible with jquery 1.8.2?
[04:47:29] <Cork> juria_roberts: that jquery ui version is quite old
[04:47:40] <Cork> compared to the jquery version
[04:48:00] <juria_roberts> Cork: i thought the version numbers should be same
[04:48:10] <Cork> no
[04:48:23] <Cork> jquery-ui has a completely version number
[04:48:43] <Cork> jquery-ui 1.8.2 is from 2010-06-07
[04:48:50] <bambanx> Maybe this can be work http://www.jstween.org/
[04:49:52] <Cork> *a completely different version number
[04:50:42] <Cork> juria_roberts: you should be using jquery-ui 1.9 or 1.10
[04:51:10] <juria_roberts> Cork: i hardcode the animation as backin and it worked thanks a lot :)
[04:51:34] <Cork> juria_roberts: you REALLY shouldn't do that
[04:51:50] <juria_roberts> Cork: no one will notice
[04:51:53] <Cork> the plugins clearly are broken
[04:52:04] <Cork> juria_roberts: you don't know what else is broken
[04:52:11] <juria_roberts> Cork: yes its broken for sure
[04:52:24] <juria_roberts> Cork: i think its not compatible with the latest jquery versions
[04:53:00] <Cork> juria_roberts: uh... jquery ui 1.8.2 is 3 years old
[04:53:53] <juria_roberts> Cork: ohh
[04:54:11] <juria_roberts> Cork: ok ill try changing that and seeing if it works
[04:54:42] <kerozene> bambanx: just saw your messages. it's not flash. let me get you the link
[04:54:44] <Cork> at least jump to the latest patch version 1.8.24
[04:54:58] <Cork> just it looks like they don't support 1.8.x anymore
[04:55:07] <kerozene> bambanx: it's a port from actionscript to js
[04:55:21] <bambanx> Gra
[04:55:26] <bambanx> Greenao

[04:56:02] <Beam> hi
[04:56:23] <Beam> i have a big problem with safari on iphone.. my ajax requests are being submitted twice with one $.ajax call
[04:56:47] <Beam> once with a body and once without
[04:57:05] <Beam> and it's the last one that is returned to the callback, so it's useless
[04:57:12] <kerozene> bambanx: http://www.greensock.com/gsap-js/
[04:57:28] <bambanx> Ty men
[04:57:43] <kerozene> apparently they've added a plugin so you can use it as a driver for $.animate()
[04:59:14] <bilel> when doing a console.log to the return value of a jquery selector (which retrieves the selected option of a select) I can see the object is "Object[option]", how can I find the API of this object on the jquery documentation, to know which properties / methods are available on it?
[05:00:41] <juria_roberts> Cork: it worked
[05:00:48] <juria_roberts> Cork:thank you
[05:01:39] <juria_roberts> Cork: no wait it didnt i cleared the cache

[05:26:56] <boulet101010> hi alcho
[05:27:08] <zulu-gula> I would like to print some pages aftrer form submit and save content, how would be the best way to do it? on success save should I open new tabs in browser with those pages?
[05:29:49] <alcho> zulu-gula: is it a confirmation page? you want it to be in a printer friendly format after the form submits?
[05:31:07] <zulu-gula> kind of confirmation, but what exactly it should do is to generate various attachements to print, and those attachements should be filled with content from the saved form. Before user save the form, he should picks wich attachement should be printed after save.
[05:34:19] <nextime> hello. jquery 1.3 beta1: is there a wat to detect if a panel is open? ( i need to react in a different way to some events in case it is open )
[05:35:30] <alcho> zulu-gula: what's your server setup like? apache/php?
[05:35:40] <zulu-gula> alcho, yes
[05:38:04] <alcho> zulu-gula: well it seems to me most of the work would be done sever side, do you already have the pdfs generated on submit?
[05:38:27] <zulu-gula> alcho, these are not pdf, these are html pages
[05:40:55] <alcho> zulu-gula: ah right, sorry. A new tab is possible, but it sounds quite strange to open multiple tabs as confirmation
[05:41:20] <alcho> zulu-gula: could you attach all the html's to the same page as links?
[05:42:27] <zulu-gula> I could do so
[05:42:35] <alcho> zulu-gula: so you could have the main confirmation page, and links to the other versions
[05:42:57] <alcho> zulu-gula: what is the nature of these attachments?
[05:43:11] <zulu-gula> tables
[05:44:15] <alcho> zulu-gula: you could append them all to a single confirmation page and have them hidden by default. Then toggle them to show when clicking the relative button
[05:44:48] <zulu-gula> or I could open pages in separate tabs by js and auto print them
[05:47:07] <alcho> zulu-gula: I guess so, i'm not familiar with triggering print from js however

[06:35:58] <brantje> Its a simple question ^^
[06:38:23] <_Andrei_> maybe when you take action on a  (box) ... the other boxes are acting as if it's one free space

[06:48:47] <_Andrei_> i have made that once but don't remember the right syntax
[06:49:11] <nextime> docs about panels in jquerymobile for 1.3.0 beta 1 is saying that there is a method "refresh" that doesn't exists
[06:49:38] <mage_> how could I do a myElem.parentNode.removeChild(myElem) in the jqueyr way ?
[06:49:44] <mhn23> hey everybody. is it allowed to ask for help here?
[06:50:23] <_Andrei_> just to assign a form_field content to a php var instead of just printing in in the DOM
[06:50:56] <_Andrei_> any way to do that without Ajax?
[06:51:21] <_Andrei_> i mean just some kind of $var = var !
[06:53:58] <mhn23> alright if anybody might help me on that one: http://goo.gl/vyuoO
[06:54:24] <mhn23> its a local scroll related question
[06:58:04] <marcules> mhn23, du hast n 404 bei deiner Environment-Seite
[06:58:41] <mhn23> ich schick es dir via pm
[06:59:02] <mhn23> & danke fürs reinschauen
[07:00:50] <_Andrei_> *du hast* sounds like Rammstein :) marcules
[07:01:17] <marcules> _Andrei_, it does :D
[07:01:44] <_Andrei_> jquery & Rammsein ... what else ? cool
[07:02:32] <_Andrei_> anyway, I still can't pass my js variable to a php variable
[07:05:07] <maiagallo> _Andrei_ I don't think it's possible
[07:05:19] <_Andrei_> i have done it long ago
[07:06:17] <maiagallo> What do you need to do?
[07:06:26] <_Andrei_> i just have to use "<?php $var  ?>" inside javascript
[07:07:27] <marcules> _Andrei_, you can if your JS-File is actually a php-parsed file
[07:07:32] <_Andrei_> i have a var vith the text of a form field, and i need to pass it to a php var on .click()
[07:07:47] <AdamPDotty> plus: <?php $var  ?> does not actually do anything
[07:08:05] <ZachDragon> You would need an echo or print command.
[07:08:28] <_Andrei_> everybody on stackoverflow keep saying "use ajax"
[07:08:38] <maiagallo> yeah, use ajax
[07:08:41] * AdamPDotty wonders why
[07:09:04] <_Andrei_> is ajax the only way ?
[07:09:22] <maiagallo> yes
[07:09:30] <maiagallo> easiest for sure
[07:10:14] <AdamPDotty> maybe you could write a web service in Java, if you like it complicated
[07:10:20] <_Andrei_> did someone did simple jquery ajax calls with fuelphp ? nothing in the docs
[07:10:31] <Beam> hmm
[07:10:40] <Beam> having trouble that $.browser isn't propagated
[07:10:47] <_Andrei_> wow AdamPDotty :) just for retriving a var ?
[07:11:45] <maiagallo> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[07:12:33] <_Andrei_> thx maiagallo i'll try that
[07:17:40] <Beam> retarded... $.browser is ninjaremoved in 1.9.0
[07:18:25] <Beam> and $.support is useless, and clearly states that any of the tests in $.support may be removed at any time
[07:23:28] <miketaylr> i guess if you define "ninjaremoved" as "was annouced forever"
[07:30:02] <Drager> Is .live() not in jquery 1.9?
[07:30:39] <tw2113> version deprecated: 1.7, removed: 1.9
[07:30:40] <is_null> Drager: deprecated in favor of on()
[07:32:03] <Drager> is_null: Yeah I see. But .on() doesn't do the same thing?
[07:34:11] <Brodingo> Drager its better!
[07:35:52] <mattyh88> hi, can someone help me with this error please? I'm getting an illegal character error. http://jsfiddle.net/PZXbF/
[07:36:14] <mattyh88> (on line 11)
[07:36:56] <Drager> Brodingo: Well, a plugin I'm using doesn't work the same way with .on instead of .live
[07:36:59] <quicksilver> yes, mattyh88, there is a bullet on line 11.
[07:37:12] <mattyh88> quicksilver: what is wrong there?
[07:37:13] <Brodingo> Drager well do you need to update to 1.9?
[07:37:20] <quicksilver> mattyh88: the bullet on line 11 is wrong.
[07:37:26] <quicksilver> mattyh88: it is an illegal character, as the error said.
[07:38:05] <mattyh88> quicksilver: what is?
[07:38:19] <Drager> Brodingo: Not at the moment.
[07:38:20] <mattyh88> that red dot? that's something from jsfiddle i think
[07:38:26] <Drager> but I think like why not
[07:38:40] <Brodingo> i think you just answered your own question
[07:39:56] <quicksilver> mattyh88: I dunno, that red dot looks liek an illegal character to me. When it's gone I don't get the error any more.
[07:41:59] <Drager> Brodingo: ;)
[07:42:14] <Brodingo> hehe
[07:42:55] <mattyh88> quicksilver, well i haven't got that red dot in my app either hehe .. :) but still it's giving me the illegal char
[07:43:16] <quicksilver> mattyh88: if you are getting an illegal char error then you have some dodgy character in there.
[07:43:26] <quicksilver> your font or your editor might not be showing it to you
[07:43:27] <quicksilver> but it's there.
[07:44:20] <quicksilver> I would select-delete the chars aroudn where jsfiddle shows the bullet and re-type.
[07:47:44] <mattyh88> o wow that's just the weirdest error i ever had :O I just deleted the ";" and typed it again
[07:47:53] <mattyh88> quicksilver: and error is gone now :O :P
[07:48:05] <mattyh88> has been driving me mad for the last hour now
[07:48:13] <quicksilver> you probably hit Alt or Ctrl accidentally while typing
[07:48:17] <quicksilver> and typed something odd.
[07:48:25] <quicksilver> which didn't show up in your editor.
[07:48:41] <mattyh88> quicksilver: probably
[07:48:42] <mattyh88> :p
[07:48:44] <mattyh88> thx
[07:48:47] <quicksilver> personally I use an editor which doesn't hide any characters for exactly that reason, I've done it enough times :)

[07:51:10] <shadow_fox> hi, how to show different background color for each slider img in a slideshow , which will rotate as per the slideshow
[07:53:03] <shadow_fox> something like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13947563/orbit-slider-with-wordpress-add-background-color-fadein-out-per-slide
[07:54:28] <Brodingo> shadow_fox are you using that plugin? / what are you using?
[07:55:18] <shadow_fox> I am using bootstrap carousel as of now but I am open to everything. Brodingo
[07:56:58] <shadow_fox> I want that effect so if anything that can be done with that plugin that would be great. Cause I will change the slider as of now the carousel is only slide, I want that to fade also. So I guess that need to be changed or tweaked
[07:58:37] <Brodingo> well theres a lot of ways to go about it query ui can animate color
[07:59:00] <Brodingo> you could also add a css transition and use .css() to set it before the slide change
[07:59:40] <Brodingo> *jquery ui
[08:00:07] <shadow_fox>  Brodingo: Can it be like sync with the parent slider I mean the image slider ?
[08:01:09] <Brodingo> i guess thats just up to however you're specifying the duration
[08:02:27] <Vendethiel> Hi, i'm looking for a way to inject html into jquery ui's tooltip.
[08:03:36] <Brodingo> Vendethiel did you look at the content option in the docs?
[08:04:48] <StR> Hi everyone. does anyone know how to add a new group to the JQueryUI accordion widget?
[08:04:48] <Vendethiel> Brodingo, having to change content manually for each one seems a bit of a pita to
[08:04:50] <Vendethiel> eme
[08:05:40] <Brodingo> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[08:06:15] <Vendethiel> instead of just using title attr
[08:07:26] <trewq> Hi folks - came across this really nice webapp. http://www.stack-ed.com/  . I am new to frond end development, and wanted to find out how the "Get started" button takes you to the next page - I know this is a very basic question. The setup for the app per the developer is AppEngine, HTML5BP, Bootstrap (I got rid of the rounded corners), jQuery, Backbone, Require.js, Less and Moment.js.
[08:09:05] <Vendethiel> plus it doesn't even handles newlines
[08:19:23] <raboof> hi! is there an elegant way of focussing the 'next input field' given an input field?
[08:21:00] <BadCodSmell> How do I get $(element).data("hi", "there") to stick?
[08:21:08] <BadCodSmell> I find that it's not sticking
[08:21:31] <BadCodSmell> Later on when the element gets put into the dom the data is gone
[08:21:36] <BadCodSmell> This is always happening to me
[08:21:48] <BadCodSmell> How can I get the data setter to actually work?
[08:21:53] <Drager> Can you get the rel from a link?
[08:22:22] <BadCodSmell> $('a')[0].rel or maybe .attr('rel')
[08:22:40] <raboof> (to answer my own question: jfgi, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/290535/best-way-to-find-next-form-input-element-in-jquery )
[08:24:18] <BadCodSmell> Basiclaly when I insert into the dom, the data attribute is lost
[08:24:28] <BadCodSmell> What is the point of the data setter if it doesn't work?
[08:24:43] <BadCodSmell> Do I need to JSON.stringify it or something?
[08:26:14] <BadCodSmell> jquery must have the ability to passthrough data
[08:26:45] <BadCodSmell> because $('<fart data-smell="creamy"/>'); works.
[08:27:15] <BadCodSmell> Is these a bug for this, what version will it be fixed in?
[08:27:30] <BadCodSmell> I've been having these problems since 1.8
[08:27:58] <Brodingo> .data does not set data-* attributes
[08:27:58] <NoiseEee> BadCodSmell: .data stuff doesn't go in the dom, its used by jquery
[08:28:09] <NoiseEee> jinx private
[08:28:23] <Brodingo> :X
[08:28:29] <BadCodSmell> But it reads it from the DOM, that's stupid
[08:28:42] <BadCodSmell> however, element.attr('data-smell', 'eggy') works.
[08:28:47] <Brodingo> i think reading is pretty smart personally
[08:29:10] <BadCodSmell> element.attr('data-smell', JSON.stringify('eggy')) works I mean.
[08:29:29] <BadCodSmell> Why read it and not write it?
[08:29:33] <BadCodSmell> This makes no sense to me.
[08:29:56] <BadCodSmell> Is it because jquery has no json stringify only json parse?
[08:30:43] <NoiseEee> BadCodSmell: if you want it in the DOM (ie: you want to select elements via data- attributes) you should set it as proper attribute
[08:30:51] <NoiseEee> BadCodSmell: its all there in the documentation
[08:31:41] <BadCodSmell> I'm selecting them via classes, the data tell it what to do about those classes, ie what events to hook onto them.
[08:31:50] <BadCodSmell> Anyway attr works.
[08:32:34] <BadCodSmell> I couldn't see it in the doc but I only skimmed, something like this should be in big bold letters at the top, because you would expect it to work like most of the other functions
[08:33:23] <Brodingo> its really not the primary function of .data
[08:33:38] <Brodingo> that functionality was added around 1.4
[08:33:46] <BadCodSmell> Does jquery come with json stringification/encoding capabilities?
[08:34:51] <BadCodSmell> Because I am pretty sure that is the reason why.
[08:35:38] <jomofcw> Is it right : using $('#myID button[name=myName]').on('click',function(){console.log('hello world');}); it should echo "hello world" each time I click on the button[name=myname] which is in #myID, including those creating after this line was called ?
[08:36:02] <xec> nope
[08:37:03] <xec> jomofcw: read about delegated events http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[08:37:22] <Brodingo> (also why not just use the id?)
[08:37:37] <xec> jomofcw: also, by "creating" i assume you mean "created"
[08:37:47] <xec> Brodingo: because the id is an ancestor element
[08:38:10] <Brodingo> oh i accidentally a word sorry
[08:38:58] <BadCodSmell> I swear this is nuts
[08:39:06] <BadCodSmell> do I have to to both data and attr?
[08:39:22] <jomofcw> xec right my english is really bad sorry :/
[08:40:07] <xec> jomofcw: no worries :) just making sure i didn't misunderstand something
[08:40:48] <jomofcw> OK xec, so if I understand well the doc you give me I should write $('#myID').on('click','button[name=myName]',...) ?
[08:40:55] <xec> exactly
[08:41:03] <jomofcw> Thanks for your help and your time xec :).
[08:41:18] <VinSpee> morning gents
[08:41:21] <xec> :)
[08:41:36] <VinSpee> I'm working on building a toggler that I can reuse
[08:41:58] <VinSpee> so far I have it toggling, but it toggles EVERY element, not just the one that's clicked.
[08:42:00] <VinSpee> code: https://gist.github.com/4657056
[08:44:16] <VinSpee> any ideas?
[08:44:22] <litenull> Hi. I have a question. Can I make a selector by element position ? Something like "SELECT EVERY ELEMENT IN THE TABLE WHERE LEFT=20". I have a table that is formatted in a strange way, so I must select the column based on the clicked td position.
[08:46:05] <Brodingo> litenull you could probably write a filter function for that, not that anyone would condone that
[08:46:08] <xec> VinSpee: i can't really tell what it's doing, how about return new Toggle();
[08:46:45] <litenull> Brodingo: I'm using that, but it's reaallly slow. It takes 100 in a browser, and 1sec in mobile.
[08:46:53] <litenull> 100ms*
[08:47:15] <xec> VinSpee: if not i dunno ;) anyway i'm off, too noisy at work. good luck
[08:47:34] <Brodingo> lite yeah attaching js behavior based on strange css formatting seems like…. i dunno… evil?
[08:47:35] <litenull> I was wondering if there was any $('td left=20') like thing
[08:47:38] <VinSpee> I am creating a new instance.. thanks tho
[08:47:55] <Drager> BadCodSmell: Thanks
[08:48:24] <litenull> Brodingo: the problem is i'm using user exported html, so i cant use right html syntax. i must use position :)
[08:48:52] <Brodingo> i will keep you in my prayers litenull
[08:49:25] <litenull> Brodingo: nah, it's working fine. The problem is it's too slow for the USER EXPERIENCE, SMOOTHNESS
[08:49:31] <litenull> :D
[08:50:53] <litenull> so there is no position selector ? :sad:
[08:52:36] <Brodingo> i don't think there are _any_ css based selectors
[08:52:48] <Brodingo> maaaybe visible counts
[08:52:53] <litenull> yeah im realizing
[08:53:03] <litenull> google tells me the same
[08:53:19] <litenull> too bad, thanks anyway
[09:32:52] <VictorCL> will console.log() make javascript error on IE ?
[09:32:58] <NoiseEee> VictorCL: yes
[09:33:04] <VictorCL> o.O
[09:33:23] <NoiseEee> VictorCL: unless the console is open, it will certainly mess up (old?) IE
[09:33:50] <NoiseEee> http://patik.com/blog/detailed-console-logging/ @ VictorCL
[09:34:07] <NoiseEee> also http://patik.com/blog/complete-cross-browser-console-log/
[09:34:32] <NoiseEee> but basically, just don't have it in production really.
[09:35:06] <VictorCL> ok it will work anyway in IE 8+
[09:36:09] <VictorCL> I dont care about ie6 or 7
[09:38:01] <VictorCL> like 1% of users use this browser
[09:38:07] <VictorCL> on muy site
[09:52:32] <hool> hi
[10:02:14] <Kambfhase> bot-t: hi!
[10:02:17] <bot-t> Kambfhase, #13009 (Hi ticker error)  jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 8 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13009
[10:02:32] <Kambfhase> bot-t: I love you
[10:02:32] <bot-t> no you don't
[10:02:38] <Kambfhase> :(
[10:02:51] <dblosevn> bot-t: you are awesome
[10:02:52] <bot-t> dblosevn, Is that a question?
[10:03:06] <dblosevn> guess not lol
[10:03:57] <Kambfhase> bot-t: you like Siri better than Eliza, don't you?
[10:03:58] <bot-t> Kambfhase, Signs point to yes.
[10:04:15] <dblosevn> damn pro apple bot
[10:04:34] <bla> Hello.
[10:04:44] <Kambfhase> that was a hilarious answer
[10:05:59] <bla> I wonder how can I safely embedd json inside a HTML page. I was doing: <script>var complicated_data='HERE JSON';</script> And escaped ', but it's not enough. Browsers escape such string literals when they see <script> which is WEIRD.
[10:06:17] <bla> I guess I could do base64 encoding and decoding, but is it really necessary?
[10:06:40] <NoiseEee> bla: var p = <valid json>;    is certainly fine
[10:06:40] <Kambfhase> please paste your JSON somewhere
[10:06:58] <NoiseEee> bla: but perhaps you want to query an object and not JSON ?
[10:07:00] <bla> NoiseEee, not for firefox at least I'm afraid.
[10:07:11] <NoiseEee> bla: up to you to prove it failing.  jsfiddle, etc
[10:07:27] <hool> anyone use brunch to package their apps?
[10:08:32] <bla> http://nopaste.info/263414003f.html  this causes a fail
[10:09:14] <bla> This is exactly what got sent in HTML body
[10:10:03] <bla> Firefox via firebug logged 'unterminated string literal' at "<script>alert....  <- at "
[10:10:10] <Kambfhase> Why do you do that anyways?
[10:10:27] <bla> I've got pretty complicated form filling javascript using jquery
[10:10:45] <bla> I'm passing it query parsed by a server so it is able to fill the form.
[10:10:53] <Kambfhase> mkay
[10:11:12] <bla> There is single JS for handling the form, few backends, so it was easier to write once in JS
[10:11:58] <chrisbolton_> Anyone have suggestions on libraries or plugins for client side sorting and searching?
[10:12:25] <Kambfhase> well, you could just put your code into a .js file and your done. But still, i guess you should not eval code, to begin with.
[10:12:53] <Kambfhase> chrisbolton_: .sort() .indexOf() ?
[10:13:02] <bla> Putting it inside js will require decoding arguments twice. Not best idea IMHO (as it requires fat search operation)
[10:13:53] <bla> I just want to pass JS a dictionary 'field: value'
[10:15:12] <NoiseEee> bla: putting "var p = '{"_generic": "<script>alert(1);</script>"}' "  into console in firebug/firefox was not an issue for me?
[10:15:34] <bla> It shouldn't be. It's a valid JS.
[10:15:53] <bla> It's just putting it inside <script> causes <script> to be magically interpreted as new <script> environment
[10:15:58] <bla> firefox magic for bad sites.
[10:16:13] <Kambfhase> no, the problem is the </script>
[10:16:38] <bla> Well, true. By passing:
[10:16:48] <bla> </script><script>alert(1);</script>
[10:16:54] <bla> I can do even an JS injection in this setting.
[10:17:01] <Kambfhase> why not go for <script src="externalfile.js"></script>
[10:17:44] <Kambfhase> or you could appen the </script> later, or split it into two string, ...
[10:17:46] <bla> I would have to either store the data somewhere (hard) or redesign whole system (base64 will be easier) or perform a search operation twice (once for html site, secondly for external .js
[10:18:22] <blez> I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/36C5e/2/
[10:18:26] <bla> Hmhm. I guess I could manually escape </script> by replacing it with something... not perfect though.
[10:18:28] <blez> how can I make the elements draggable?
[10:18:42] <Kambfhase> "search operation"? moving JS Code into a separate file is generally a good idea
[10:19:03] <bla> Kambfhase, this is dynamically generated by search engine which works as a b2b module contacted by a site backend
[10:19:11] <Kambfhase> kk
[10:19:22] <bla> Would it be static - no prob; but it's not
[10:20:14] <bla> Searcher analyzes query, generates this JS and produces number of results. All get included somehow in the page
[10:20:19] <Kambfhase> well yeah, replacing sounds about the best way to go.
[10:22:32] <Drager> Do jquery has a prompt command?=
[10:23:53] <bla> Drager, using firefox with firebug effectively gives you jquery prompt
[10:24:39] <Armistice> http://jsfiddle.net/sDagQ/ is there a reason why the overlay isn't fading in? It's being appended, but remains hidden.
[10:24:59] <Drager> bla: I meant more like a dialog like a alert box but found http://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[10:25:22] <Kambfhase> Armistice: you fadeIn the body, not the overlay
[10:25:32] <Armistice> nice catch kambfhase.
[10:25:49] <Kambfhase> overlay.appendTo("body").fadeIn(400);
[10:26:43] <bla> Kambfhase, I'll replace </ with <" + "/   -- should be generic, shouldn't break the JSON and shouldn't be possible to omit anyhow.
[10:27:18] <Kambfhase> yeah
[10:30:40] <Drager> Any idea if google cdn provides jquery ui css?
[10:32:16] <someprimetime> Yes it does.
[10:32:17] <someprimetime> http://blog.jqueryui.com/2012/10/jquery-ui-1-9-0/

[10:43:08] <Drager> Any idea why jqueryui dialog is bugged? http://i.imgur.com/MJ7KecB.png
[10:43:12] <benzrf> what's the best way to check if an element is focused in jquery>
[10:43:15] <benzrf> should I use a selector and see if there are results or what?
[10:43:36] <Drager> Using newest jquery and jqueryui
[10:44:10] <benzrf> hm?
[10:44:13] <BillCriswell> benzrf: .is(':focus') maybe?
[10:44:18] <benzrf> thank you :)
[10:44:46] <BillCriswell> benzrf: That question mark meant I wasn't positive... but should be a good start haha.
[10:45:41] <benzrf> does :selected indicate focus?
[10:45:42] <benzrf> :s
[10:45:49] <Kambfhase> no
[10:45:55] <benzrf> waaait, never mind
[10:45:55] <Cahnory> benzrf: nop
[10:45:57] * benzrf headdesks
[10:45:58] <blez> http://jsfiddle.net/8snSf/1307/
[10:46:06] <blez> why is_dragging is always false?
[10:47:06] <chrisbolton_> Thanks Kambfhase. I was thinking something more like list.js. Sorry I typed this earlier and got distracted.
[10:47:10] <benzrf> BillCriswell: thank you, this is a good thing :3
[10:47:18] <Kambfhase> list.js?
[10:47:22] <benzrf> chrisbolton_: why do you still have an underscore on your name?
[10:47:23] <benzrf> .-.
[10:47:42] * blez pokes Kambfhase
[10:47:45] <chrisbolton_> benzrf: No idea.
[10:48:13] <chrisbolton_> Kambfhase: http://listjs.com/
[10:48:14] <benzrf> did you join and there was already a chrisbolton?
[10:49:05] <chrisbolton_> benzrf: I forgot I have two irc accounts one with an underscore one without. Not sure why. I think I created one from home and one from work.
[10:49:22] <benzrf> how strange
[10:49:57] <Kambfhase> chrisbolton_: k, thx.
[10:50:09] <Kambfhase> blez: wait, ...
[10:51:34] <benzrf> hmm
[10:51:40] <benzrf> how do I remove the corners on a dropdown box
[10:52:20] <Armistice> blez I set a breakpoint and it is being triggerd, and it is being set to true and false when it should.
[10:52:47] <blez> strange.
[10:52:57] <Kambfhase> blez: http://jsfiddle.net/8snSf/1316/
[10:53:07] <someprimetime> Removing corners on a dropdown box? Sounds like a CSS issue
[10:53:13] <blez> why it's not red then
[10:53:13] <Kambfhase> you have to attach the events to the elements being dragged
[10:53:31] <Aha2Y> Can someone tell me why http://www.aha2y.nl/assets/js/Select.js doesn't work with the table on http://www.aha2y.nl/scripts.php?
[10:53:34] <benzrf> oh damn
[10:53:37] <benzrf> I was thinking I was in #web
[10:53:40] <benzrf> sorry lol
[10:54:09] <Kambfhase> Aha2Y: 404
[10:54:30] <Aha2Y> oops http://www.aha2y.nl/assets/js/select.js
[10:54:31] <Kambfhase> blez: maybe your .mousedown() gets executed before the actual drag
[10:54:38] <Aha2Y> But it worked before.
[10:54:59] <blez> yes
[10:55:26] <blez> but how to get the dragging element then?
[10:55:36] <Kambfhase> thou shall not put opening braces on a new line. -- Gods law #11
[10:55:37] <blez> and change it in the start of the sortable
[10:56:21] <Kambfhase> blez: look at the code I pasted. you should work with the events
[10:58:20] <mhn23> a good reference where to learn js + jquery? (if in german i appreciate it but english works too)
[10:58:49] <Kambfhase> eloquentjavascript
[10:59:06] <Drager> Any idea why jqueryui dialog is bugged? http://i.imgur.com/MJ7KecB.png I'm using the latest jquery and jqueryui
[10:59:34] <Aha2Y> eh?
[11:01:07] <theBrettman> are there more complete docs for jquery mobile somewhere cuz there's not enough on each plugin specifically page
[11:01:52] <theBrettman> so I can know all options. Like $.mobile.page.prototype.options
[11:02:31] <ZachDragon> mhn23: http://www.codecademy.com/ is a good place to start with basic js.
[11:03:00] <mhn23> thx kambfhase and zachdragon so far
[11:03:29] <geealdine> My jquery mobile site works fine of I load it from decade, but when I load it from my domain, my images aren't loading
[11:03:49] <geealdine> *load locally
[11:04:29] <geealdine> I can't figure the error
[11:05:12] <geealdine> My dir is / & /m/
[11:05:38] <ZachDragon> mhn23: No problem!
[11:06:02] <geealdine> And when I see props of my missing image, it is correct, but image isn't loading
[11:07:07] <mhn23> @zachdragon nice site! thx
[11:07:27] <mhn23> rly like the response/interactivity
[11:08:04] <ZachDragon> mhn23: Yep! It is great for learning the basics in a few languages.
[11:09:20] <lxsameer> how can i check if a selector, select tags ?
[11:10:07] <dblosevn> alert($('selector').size());
[11:10:28] <lxsameer> dblosevn: thanks
[11:10:32] <dblosevn> np
[11:12:31] <geealdine> Is there a jquery Mobile channel?
[11:12:38] <theBrettman> only for dev
[11:12:48] <theBrettman> and there's tons missing from the docs
[11:12:51] <someprimetime> Why not just use .length?
[11:13:04] <geealdine> Hmm, nobody answered here
[11:13:07] <theBrettman> I'm looking at the $.mobile obj in my console now, lol
[11:13:12] <Kambfhase> alert() is not a debugger
[11:13:26] <dblosevn> then console.log
[11:13:36] <theBrettman> I'm not sure what code you're using on your images but I'm new to mobile anyway
[11:13:49] <dblosevn> and .length and size return the same value
[11:13:52] <geealdine> I cant load images on jquery mobile
[11:14:03] <theBrettman> did you put data-rel="external"?
[11:14:06] <Nece228> $(this).parents('tr:first').prev().find('a').attr('href').replaceWith($(this).parents('tr:first').find('a').attr('href'))
[11:14:12] <Nece228> why this doesnt work?
[11:14:14] <theBrettman> on the image links
[11:14:30] <Kambfhase> ?p @ Nece228
[11:14:31] <bot-t> Nece228, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:14:46] <geealdine> Just plain old sex=
[11:15:17] <blez> Kambfhase http://jsfiddle.net/8snSf/1325/ see this
[11:15:26] <geealdine> *href=
[11:15:28] <blez> it works fine, but when I drag to right, it makes a small gap
[11:15:33] <Kambfhase> Nece228: .attr('href') is a string, not a DOM-Node
[11:15:50] <Nece228> Kambfhase: yeah, how to deal with strings?
[11:16:25] <Kambfhase> use .attr('href','http://new.value/') to set a new value
[11:17:14] <Kambfhase> blez: wow, that gap sucks, eh?
[11:17:23] <blez> yes
[11:17:32] <blez> I wonder how to fix it
[11:17:33] <geealdine> How do load an mobile dir image, what is fqn? If you have a m dir and it is subdomain as in m.yourdomain.com
[11:19:22] <blez> any ideas?
[11:19:32] <Kambfhase> nope
[11:19:34] <theBrettman> I guess I will have to make my own jquery mobile docs
[11:19:51] <theBrettman> just to show each plugins options
[11:20:47] <zulu-gula1> if I want to use autocomplete with multiple choice, I can use autocomplete from jqueryui or autocomplete plugin?
[11:23:15] <theBrettman> zulu-gula1: I suggest you make your own widget that extends the jquery-ui one
[11:23:46] <Nece228> Kambfhase: ok thanks, ill try
[11:24:14] <zulu-gula1> theBrettman, why to not use something what is already done?
[11:24:41] <darsain> anyone knows about library like bootstrap's ScrollSpy with nice API?
[11:25:39] <theBrettman> zulu-gula1, I don't think any have multiple select..
[11:25:40] <Es0teric> whats a jquery slider that handles more than 20 images, paginates them and allows the user to view every 5 image or so?
[11:26:21] <theBrettman> Es0teric: any slider you find can do that.
[11:26:32] <Es0teric> theBrettman really? even slidesjs?
[11:27:08] <geealdine> You know how you link to divs easily in html by their id as in href=id, how to this within script
[11:27:36] <theBrettman> yes, Es0teric. Look at the dogs. it has pagination. I'm sure it probably supports loading some images with ajax too
[11:27:44] <theBrettman> *docs
[11:27:56] <Es0teric> theBrettman no no i want to view more than one image at a time
[11:28:09] <Es0teric> i have seen sliders that only show one image at a time in next/preb
[11:28:11] <Es0teric> *prev
[11:28:33] <theBrettman> I'm sure there's a setting for that too
[11:28:49] <Es0teric> i dont see a setting for that...
[11:28:50] <theBrettman> sometimes you want both
[11:29:37] <theBrettman> geealdine: if you're trying to do that in mobile, it doesn't work that way
[11:30:47] <darsain> anyonw knows about plugin/library that would update active side navigation item based on page scroll position? (like Bootstrap's ScrollSpy)
[11:31:05] <fission6> is there a solid jquery plugin for handling client side data retrieval?
[11:31:47] <epochwolf> How would I get the documentation for jQuery 1.3.2? I'm stuck working on a project with this version and I'm not allowed to upgrade it.
[11:32:06] <theBrettman> Es0teric, sometimes that functionaliity isn't in the docs and you have to look at its object to find it in your console.
[11:33:04] <theBrettman> epochwolf, I think you're outta luck man. best bet is to ask questions in here on what you're trying to do. there's no doc archives
[11:33:10] <Es0teric> theBrettman well i have a rough idea of what i want to accomplish... i just needed to know what makes the slider... so i can probably accomplsih this in slidesjs
[11:33:15] <neataroni> i would like to get the width of a div on window resize, how might i do this?
[11:33:21] <Es0teric> as long as the images stay in the width of the container
[11:33:34] <epochwolf> theBrettman: IS the 1.3.2 source available?
[11:33:46] <epochwolf> otherwise I'll be asking a lot of stupid questions.
[11:33:58] <theBrettman> epochwolf, yes. I'll give you a link
[11:34:54] <fission6> jStorage? Jstore?
[11:35:10] <epochwolf> theBrettman: is there a way to do unobtrusive javascript with ajax page replacement on 1.3?
[11:35:30] <theBrettman> epochwolf, http://code.jquery.com/#jquery-all
[11:35:32] <BillCriswell> neataroni: http://jsbin.com/ewaniv/1/edit
[11:35:35] <epochwolf> theBrettman: the devs on this project were shoving everything in onclick
[11:36:10] <epochwolf> theBrettman: I want http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.3.2-build.zip, right?
[11:36:13] <neataroni> BillCriswell: thank you
[11:36:18] <BillCriswell> neataroni: No problem.
[11:36:25] <theBrettman> idk epochwolf, I wasn't using it until 1.4 or so
[11:36:38] <lxsameer> how can i select all the <a> with an specific href ?
[11:37:03] <epochwolf> theBrettman: I guess I'm back to 2000-ear practices then. :)
[11:37:07] <epochwolf> era*
[11:37:08] <NoiseEee> lxsameer: $('a[href="specific_href"]')
[11:37:35] <theBrettman> $('a [href=value]') or $('a').href('value')
[11:37:43] <theBrettman> but I would go with the first
[11:37:44] <fission6> i guess ill go with jStorage
[11:37:51] <theBrettman> depending on what you're doing
[11:38:25] <Kambfhase> theBrettman: depending on what you are doing both might be stupid.
[11:38:43] <theBrettman> definitely
[11:38:55] <theBrettman> knowing objects helps a lot
[11:39:04] <theBrettman> which is why I'm hating the mobile docs
[11:39:41] <theBrettman> I want to know all options for all plugins and I have to resort to looking at the mobile obj in my console :(
[11:41:11] <epochwolf> theBrettman: http://docs.jquery.com/Release:jQuery_1.3 says 1.3 added live() support
[11:41:16] <theBrettman> it would be nice to see which order certain events fire too which isn't 100% clear
[11:41:26] <theBrettman> cool
[11:41:32] <theBrettman> you can do a lot with that then
[11:41:47] <theBrettman> I wonder when delegate came out?
[11:42:00] <epochwolf> What's delegate?
[11:42:22] <theBrettman> lol. delegate lets you set objects that haven't been created yet
[11:42:46] <epochwolf> theBrettman: you mean what .on does?
[11:43:28] <theBrettman> yes, .on works the same way
[11:43:53] <theBrettman> .on basically replaced .live, .delegate, .bind...
[11:44:03] <theBrettman> and gave us .off!
[11:44:11] <epochwolf> theBrettman: I've only used .on with ujs
[11:44:24] <theBrettman> I <3 to get .off, lol
[11:44:25] <epochwolf> I came late to modern javascript
[11:46:46] <epochwolf> theBrettman: I'm just going to fallback to onclick="close('#parent_id');" :/
[11:46:56] <epochwolf> and hate myself
[11:47:20] <theBrettman> just remember, crap code works crappy
[11:47:37] <epochwolf> theBrettman: well then it will fit right in
[11:47:43] <theBrettman> rofl
[11:48:00] <epochwolf> and working gets me paid. crappy or not.
[11:49:08] <theBrettman> i wish i got paid for my work, lol
[11:49:18] <theBrettman> doing my own projects
[11:49:19] <RuAnt> Hi, jQueryMobile question.. I have some Collapsible lists what acts like the menu for my app, is it possible to make one of the "collapsible lists" a link only. I've kinda made it work without inset, but i want inset. So when i wrap a collapsible-set around it all the link only collapsible doesn't follow the rules of collapsible-set because they are only a list with a single item...
[11:49:33] <epochwolf> theBrettman: that would be unfair to everyone else.
[11:49:48] <epochwolf> I don't get paid to have fun.
[11:50:57] <theBrettman> RuAnt, seperate links like that in a list instead and use listview on the container
[11:51:18] <theBrettman> ha, I'm not having fun. I should be done but mobile docs suck
[11:51:36] <theBrettman> well, not really but they should have some more technical docs somewhere
[11:53:32] <wiremaster> hello everyone
[11:53:43] <RuAnt> theBrettman, http://jsfiddle.net/kP3sA/   thats what i have this far... but it doesn't look good
[11:54:24] <theBrettman> RuAnt: take the corners off, lol
[11:54:49] <RuAnt> but i want the inset look
[11:54:55] <theBrettman> also change the arrows to arrow-d and arrow-u
[11:55:09] <theBrettman> that's not inset
[11:55:13] <mboro> hi guys. when is v2 expected to be released?
[11:55:23] <theBrettman> if you want inset, add inset
[11:55:30] <theBrettman> inset has a margin
[11:55:46] <theBrettman> I would group it outside the list
[11:56:04] <theBrettman> so it would go Home, Website, and then the rest...
[11:56:21] <theBrettman> or have Home after the collapsibleset
[11:56:29] <RuAnt> theBrettman, inset is default true on collapsible-set
[11:56:46] <feathersanddown> when doing $('input[type:text]').val('some value'); matched inputs trigger onchange event ?
[11:56:57] <theBrettman> and you set it to false
[11:57:36] <theBrettman> RuAnt: instead of setting all that stuff on collapsible, set it once on collapsible set instead. way easier!
[11:58:06] <theBrettman> like the arrow. and you have arrow-r for collapsed-icon
[11:58:55] <RuAnt> ok, but the listview items doesn't get the inset look. you know how i can fix that?
[11:59:09] <theBrettman> and arrow-d for expanded. semantics is arrow-d for collapsed, arrow-u for expanded
[11:59:22] <theBrettman> you have inset set to false
[12:00:07] <theBrettman> take all that stuff that affects all collapsibles and put it in collapsible-set first
[12:00:33] <theBrettman> when it's in a set, only put it on collapsible if it's meant to only affect that collapsible and not the rest
[12:01:51] <jdo_dk> Is this also the channel for asking jquerymobile questions?
[12:02:21] <theBrettman> shouldn't need iconpos="right" because that is defualt
[12:02:33] <theBrettman> yes jdo_dk
[12:02:54] <RuAnt> iconpos string, default: "left"
[12:03:20] <jdo_dk> How is this done correct: http://jsfiddle.net/D52u2/
[12:04:02] <ravenzz> jdo_dk live is old
[12:04:07] <ravenzz> use on instead
[12:04:27] <jdo_dk> ravenzz: I know, but the jquerymobile docs shows examples with live and not on
[12:04:59] <jdo_dk> the pageinit is fired just fine everytime page is changed, but the change is only fired when the page is loaded the first time.
[12:05:06] <RuAnt> theBrettman: http://jsfiddle.net/kP3sA/8/  now i've moved it all up into the collapsible-set,, how do i get Home, Map and Website into the collapsible-set so it looks the same?
[12:05:57] <ravenzz> jdo_dk that's somehow correct. because you are binding on the select rather than delegating
[12:06:03] <theBrettman> it still doesn't inset because of Map
[12:06:20] <theBrettman> so you have to set inset on map to true
[12:06:33] <jdo_dk> ravenzz: So i should use live or on ?
[12:06:40] <ravenzz> on!
[12:06:47] <ravenzz> jdo_dk http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html
[12:06:51] <jdo_dk> ravenzz: Will try
[12:07:04] <jdo_dk> I see
[12:07:08] <theBrettman> let .live die, lol
[12:08:46] <sykopomp> http://jsfiddle.net/nnEWZ/1/ I have something identical to this in my code. It works fine in the jsfiddle, but when I run it in my code, $(this).parent().get(0) => undefined.
[12:09:16] <sykopomp> I even copy-pasted my js and html from my own sources (not the stuff in the jsfiddle due to Sensitive Information™)
[12:09:39] <sykopomp> I've looked through the file for any conflicting classes and all that, and I just have no idea at this point.
[12:09:39] <RuAnt> theBrettman, there is inset on it now but since there isn't a data-role=collapsbile div wrapped around the Home, Map and Website they don't get it. if i add data-inset to those 3 listview they get a seperate inset look, not the grouped look i want :/
[12:09:42] <ravenzz> jdo_dk http://jsfiddle.net/szzgH/
[12:10:16] <theBrettman> RuAnt: just take the corners off
[12:10:35] <theBrettman> add corners to the top and bottom
[12:10:48] <RuAnt> ok
[12:11:18] <ravenzz> sykopomp mind to sharing your code?
[12:11:29] <ravenzz> $(this).parent().get(0) => undefined doesn't help
[12:11:39] <jdo_dk> ravenzz: why window.location.replace and not window.location.href ?
[12:11:51] <sykopomp> ravenzz: I don't think my boss would appreciate it :(
[12:11:59] <geekie> ;o
[12:13:38] <RuAnt> *scratches his head* nothing happens when i add data-corners="false"  :/
[12:13:39] <ravenzz> jdo_dk oh it depends on your needs... I might have "replaced" it without any reason
[12:13:50] <Nece228> is there something like exchanging items, i mean: $('elem1').exchange($('elem2'))?
[12:14:07] <ravenzz> jdo_dk here is the difference explained http://stackoverflow.com/a/1865840/931594
[12:14:30] <ravenzz> sykopomp we are here to help, not to steal your code ;)
[12:14:43] <sykopomp> ravenzz: I know. I wouldn't mind if it were mine.
[12:14:45] <Nece228> in other words to swap values
[12:14:47] <sykopomp> ...but I found the problem.
[12:15:12] <theBrettman> RuAnt: you change corners with styles, not data attributes.
[12:15:19] <sykopomp> started commenting out large chunks. Looks like blueimp's jQuery.fileupload() rewrites the dom in funny ways and it was orphaning some of the form fields. Heh.
[12:15:24] <sykopomp> or something like that.
[12:15:25] <sethetter> I'm trying to open two jQuery UI dialogs at once and it's only opening one of them. Is this something that causes problems normally?
[12:15:34] * nextime is fighting with jquery mobile 1.3.0-beta1
[12:15:50] <nextime> the panel widget events won't work
[12:16:30] <ravenzz> sykopomp great, considering that you can't share your code.. You should learn how to debug it and solve the issues yourself
[12:16:38] <ravenzz> `ftjq @ sykopomp
[12:16:45] <blez> how to get system colors with jquery?
[12:16:59] <sykopomp> ravenzz: I did. I'm sorry. I was hoping for some ideas after headdesking for a half hour. :\
[12:17:04] <ravenzz> alright fixingthesejquery.com
[12:17:06] <fission6> is their a jquery or native js to do a string format?
[12:18:04] <Kambfhase> fission6: if you mean format as in printf("%s%3d\n") then the answer is no.
[12:18:38] <chee> lol, ravenzz. did you mean to word that like the rudest person in the world
[12:19:26] <fission6> Kambfhase: just building a string
[12:19:29] <ravenzz> asdfas sorry I didn't mean to be rude :p
[12:20:18] <Kambfhase> fission6: you know, JS has a totally unituitive hacker way of concatenating strings: +
[12:20:19] <ravenzz> my english kind of sucks
[12:20:28] <fission6> yep
[12:21:18] <Kambfhase> But if you want to do it `the cool way` go for ['begin', variable, 'end'].join('')
[12:21:36] <Kambfhase> or just use on of the dozen libraries out there
[12:22:25] <fission6> hmm
[12:22:39] <fission6> var html = '<li><a href="/cards/' + key + '/details/">' + value + '</a></li>'
[12:23:21] <ravenzz> fission6 I believe that you are looking for a template engine
[12:23:33] <fission6> i would use one but thats that html
[12:23:38] <fission6> so may noe be wort oit
[12:23:39] <ravenzz> have a look at mustache  or jQuery template
[12:23:44] <fission6> yea handlebars I've used
[12:24:00] <ravenzz> or write your own "supplant" function
[12:24:23] <ravenzz> for such easy/tiny cases
[12:27:27] <ravenzz> fission6 I wrote one if you need it
[12:31:21] <theBrettman> RuAnt: have to hack jquery-mobile options to not have rounded corners on the collapsible set. good luck! I'm in the same boat!
[12:31:58] <neataroni> how would i get the currently selected option from a <select name="stations"><option.... i only want the selection of this particular select
[12:32:53] <josefrichter> guys, I need a one-liner to get an array of checked checkboxes' values, please. How do I do it? http://jsbin.com/ewused/1/edit
[12:34:00] <RuAnt> theBrettman, but you solution works tho, i'll just strip it for corners, then add it where i need it, and add a div around to add the margin :)
[12:34:05] <RuAnt> thanks :D
[12:34:38] <Brodingo> ?map @ josefrichter
[12:34:39] <bot-t> josefrichter, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[12:34:42] <theBrettman> RuAnt: I tried to strip the corners, it adds it to a class in a span it adds
[12:34:54] <jdo_dk> What am i doing wrong here: http://jsfiddle.net/6XVgA/ alert("done") is fired twice, when navigated to a page (ajax loaded) and i change the value from selectbox ?
[12:35:01] <BillCriswell> josefrichter: Why do you need a one liner?
[12:35:10] <RuAnt> just set inset to false?
[12:35:20] <Crazyzurfer> hi guys
[12:35:57] <josefrichter> BillCriswellBillCriswell coz I don't wanna initialize array and go thru .each shit and pushing to it.
[12:36:04] <josefrichter> Brodingo thanks
[12:36:58] <Crazyzurfer> how can I make an autocomplete for emails with the most common domains, for example: gmail.com, hotmail.com, because when adding emails to the database, those are the most used, and we would like to save some time :)
[12:36:59] <theBrettman> RuAnt: nope. that's not what inset is anyway. it adds corners on things but it's also supposed to add a margin but doesn't cuz how you got it wrapped with li in it.
[12:37:08] <nextime> assuming i habe a jquery mobile panel widget, is right to detect when the panel is closed to do $( "#mypanelid" ).on( "close", function(event, data) { something... }); ?
[12:37:22] <nextime> ( jquery mobile 1.3.0 beta1
[12:37:24] <nextime> )
[12:40:39] <HM> I'm a bit confused by the jQuery layout plugin
[12:43:15] <HM> the documentation says you can great several $().layout()'s
[12:43:22] <HM> but all the examples use "childOptions"
[12:43:26] <HM> which isn't even documented
[12:43:31] <jdo_dk> sorry for respam, but: What am i doing wrong here: http://jsfiddle.net/6XVgA/ alert("done") is fired twice, when navigated to a page (ajax loaded) and i change the value from selectbox ?
[12:43:37] <scar> if i have a container body div, and i want another div to "Slide in" to the left from the edge of the container--- is the best way to achieve this using .slide() ? i've ran into problems with left and right not wroking
[12:44:11] <jdo_dk> And am i using jquery mobile wrong? I have a "filter" and a "subfilter", is the another way to archive this function with jquerymobile?
[12:48:40] <Drager> Any idea why jqueryui dialog is bugged? http://i.imgur.com/MJ7KecB.png I'm using the latest jquery and jqueryui

[13:02:13] <RuAnt> theBrettman: i got it like i want now :) jsfiddle doesn't show it tho, but both firefox and chrome view it correct
[13:02:35] <theBrettman> RuAnt: how did you get around it?

[13:03:15] <RuAnt> i looks the same, but there is links and collapsible in the same view..
[13:03:23] <fission6> whats a graceful way to delete a key from an object (key/property)
[13:03:38] <NoiseEee> delete!
[13:06:48] <djQuery> Drager, I think this has been fixed,  at least I didn't see the close button behaving that way when I was testing some other stuff for a pull request I did
[13:07:25] <HM> bah
[13:07:36] <HM> the layout plugin examples created nested layouts in about 3 different ways
[13:07:45] <djQuery> Drager, what browser are you using when you see that
[13:07:56] <HM> i can't even figure out the 'proper' way
[13:08:22] <djQuery> HM, yeah I love the look of it but its kinda wonky
[13:08:39] <RuAnt> theBrettman, was it like that you wanted it aswell?
[13:09:04] <theBrettman> RuAnt: no, I thought you wanted only corners on the top and bottom items.
[13:09:15] <RuAnt> ohh, ok
[13:09:34] <RuAnt> well... i do only have corners on the top and bottom items now
[13:09:44] <RuAnt> jsfiddle doesn't show it correctly
[13:09:52] <theBrettman> oh, no wonder
[13:10:28] <RuAnt> works fine when i load it in firefox or chrome
[13:11:21] <RuAnt> and not through jsfiddle
[13:11:46] <Es0teric> when using .filter(), how do i make it filter through a json array?
[13:11:50] <djQuery> HM, if you have all your divs named correctly and don't want all the extra fancy stuff you can just call it that way
[13:12:19] <anonychus> djQuery: hi

[13:12:48] <KeyboardNotFound> can anyone help me ?
[13:13:12] <anonychus> if i like to build menus as localstorage, where i can documentation for this? do you have examples please?
[13:13:28] <Ziber> I'm trying to come up with a simple solution for horizontal scrolling, without a scrollbar. How might I do that?
[13:13:38] <Es0teric> when using .filter(), how do i make it filter through a json array?
[13:13:40] <djQuery> KeyboardNotFound, next time try using a something like jsbin.com where you can put them both in the same
[13:13:49] <guideX> how do you encode a string to travel from jquery/ajax/json post to c#? if the string contains a ' or some other characters, it doesn't make it
[13:14:03] <djQuery> KeyboardNotFound, and you pastebin is not loading
[13:14:18] <guideX> in the data: { area

[13:14:51] <djQuery> guideX, ^^^^^^^
[13:15:03] <guideX> ok cool thanks
[13:15:05] <guideX> i'll try it
[13:15:20] <Drager> djQuery: Firefox 18.0.1
[13:15:33] <guideX> by chance, know how to decode it on the other end? Or will it be ready for me?
[13:15:40] <guideX> on the webservice side in c#...
[13:15:49] <guideX> i suppose that's not a jquery question :P
[13:15:55] <anonychus> djQuery:  if i like to build menus as localstorage, where i can documentation for this? do you have examples please?
[13:15:55] <Drager> djQuery: Same in Chrome
[13:16:09] <djQuery> guideX, believe it should be fine on the other end, or you will have to do a search for urldecode
[13:16:16] <guideX> ok cool thanks
[13:16:25] <guideX> I know how to urldecode in c#, so that must be it
[13:16:32] <guideX> if i neeed it
[13:16:37] <guideX> thanks again
[13:16:51] <brettster> query add class to hey
[13:16:53] <HM> djQuery, i don't get it. All I want is bare minimal code to stick 1 layout inside the center pane of another. All the examples that do such a thing seem to do it different. when I try i just get a blank center pane and nothing appears from the inner layout
[13:17:06] <brettster> does anyone know how i would add a class to the last ul in a sitemap
[13:17:25] <brettster> like li:last-child ul
[13:17:32] <Gho5t> yepyeah fuck that shit
[13:17:34] <djQuery> HM, was just gining my general opinion, it has been at least 2 years since I looked at layout
[13:17:36] <Gho5t> whoops
[13:17:38] <brettster> or ul:last-child
[13:17:58] <Gho5t> brettster: depends on your dom
[13:18:23] <Gho5t> can just use .last() as well
[13:18:29] <guideX> var _Item = $('#yourList li').last(); ... ._Item.addClass('myclass');
[13:18:31] <guideX> I think
[13:18:37] <brettster> well dom is ul.nav li ul
[13:18:41] <djQuery> Gho5t, when I get those Q's I just open up terminal on a page and start testing them out by typing them right in terminal
[13:18:51] <brettster> i need to add a class to the last dropdown
[13:18:55] <brettster> not the last li item
[13:19:12] <guideX> I thought you have an li?
[13:19:17] <guideX> your question is confusing now..
[13:19:22] <guideX> where is a dropdown?
[13:19:27] <brettster> i need to add a class to the last dropdown
[13:19:30] <djQuery> then extrapolate your answer from his response
[13:19:31] <Gho5t> dude
[13:19:36] <Gho5t> jquery doesn't target dropdowns
[13:19:38] <brettster> the dd is a ul inside an li
[13:19:44] <Gho5t> it targets html elements and css selectors

[13:19:53] <someprimetime> wtf bot-t

[13:19:59] <Gho5t> there you go
[13:20:05] <brettster> Gho5t
[13:20:09] <brettster> a ul is an html element
[13:20:17] <Gho5t> a "dropdown" isn't
[13:20:24] <guideX> is it a .net dropdown?
[13:20:46] <brettster> so a ul inside an li isn't an html element?
[13:21:01] <guideX> now it's getting silly :)
[13:21:04] <Gho5t> lol
[13:21:06] <Gho5t> yeah I'm done
[13:21:07] <djQuery> enough
[13:21:14] <djQuery> ?demo
[13:21:15] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:21:21] <guideX> www.nomorepasting.com
[13:21:37] <brettster> Gho5t - maybe be helpful instead of condescending
[13:21:46] <Gho5t> sorry bro
[13:21:58] <Gho5t> a "dropdown" can be any html element
[13:22:02] <guideX> brettster.. put your code in www.nomorepasting.com so we can help :)
[13:22:05] <Gho5t> depending on which widget library you're using
[13:22:15] <guideX> otherwise we have a ul, an li, a ul inside and li, and a dropdown
[13:22:35] <Gho5t> so don't say "i need to target my dropdown" say I' need to target a "ul" that is in an "li" or something
[13:22:40] <Gho5t> we don't know your dom
[13:22:52] <guideX> .. oh and a kitten
[13:22:59] <guideX> sitting on the monitor
[13:23:04] <brettster> http://jsfiddle.net/z6Xvy/
[13:23:39] <brettster> so
[13:23:42] <guideX> is it the very last one you want?
[13:23:46] <brettster> add class to the last ul inside that ul
[13:23:48] <brettster> yes
[13:24:13] <HM> i can't believe there are no layout tutorials
[13:24:22] <Gho5t> yeah none
[13:24:23] <Gho5t> ever
[13:24:48] <Gho5t> brettster: $('ul > li > ul')
[13:25:03] <Gho5t> brettster: $('ul > li > ul').last()
[13:25:07] <Gho5t> rather
[13:25:38] <Gho5t> or just $('ul').last() really
[13:25:41] <brettster> what does > mean
[13:25:50] <Gho5t> child
[13:26:02] <brettster> and that applies the last class to all ul's inside an li
[13:26:03] <Gho5t> could get away without it as well
[13:26:05] <brettster> not just the last one.
[13:26:17] <brettster> which is what my problem was initital
[13:26:18] <brettster> ly
[13:26:25] <guideX> but...
[13:26:26] <Gho5t> brettster: $('ul > li > ul').last()
[13:26:29] <guideX> the kitten!
[13:26:43] <brettster> 	$(.nav > li > ul').last();
[13:26:47] <brettster> is what i have
[13:26:51] <brettster> it applies it to all LI's
[13:26:55] <brettster> or ul's i mean
[13:28:20] <Gho5t> incorrect
[13:28:21] <Gho5t> http://jsfiddle.net/z6Xvy/
[13:28:44] <Gho5t> hold on didn't save it
[13:29:04] <i`vethowt> I'm thinkin about the mella mic toadis
[13:29:08] <Gho5t> jsfiddle is running like shit lately
[13:29:10] <i`vethowt> So what's jquery
[13:29:26] <davemo> Gho5t: jsbin.com is a good alternative
[13:29:35] <i`vethowt> thanks
[13:29:41] <guideX> jquery is an awesome library which rocks javascripts socks off
[13:29:49] <Gho5t> http://jsfiddle.net/z6Xvy/2/
[13:29:57] <i`vethowt> this is cool

[13:34:27] <Crazyzurfer> how can I make an autocomplete for emails with the most common domains, for example: gmail.com, hotmail.com, because when adding emails to the database, those are the most used, and we would like to save some time :)
[13:34:59] <guideX> jquery autocomplete is great
[13:35:06] <guideX> I use it in a project or two
[13:35:40] <guideX> I use it with c#/.net with web services (heaven)
[13:35:48] <eedfwchris> "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'center' of undefined"
[13:35:50] <Kambfhase> asking that question and implementing it, might take longer than the time you are about to save.
[13:35:50] <eedfwchris> what could cause this?
[13:35:59] <eedfwchris> no set width?
[13:36:14] <fission6> whatever you are .center on is not defined
[13:36:17] <Kambfhase> eedfwchris: you are trying to read a property of an undefined variable
[13:36:53] <HM> http://pastebin.ca/2308300 <-- can someone explain why this doesn't work
[13:37:10] <eedfwchris> https://github.com/tbasse/jquery-truncate/blob/master/jquery.truncate.js << that's what causes it...
[13:37:37] <OliverJAsh> Can anybody assist me with writing an API in Express? Just need some general advice.
[13:38:04] <eedfwchris> guess I have to define side or it gets pissed
[13:38:36] <kaylee> if I've got a form with multiple submit buttons, and I've got an .on('submit') associated with it, how do I determine which of the buttons was used?
[13:39:15] <guideX> use different id's
[13:39:22] <guideX> or are they all by a class?
[13:39:35] <kaylee> they have different ID's, names and values
[13:39:38] <kaylee> haven't assigned a class
[13:39:55] <guideX> if they have a id, you can see which one it is by using the id
[13:39:59] <kaylee> but when I console.log the event, I'm not seeing anything distinguishing
[13:40:00] <guideX> like this..
[13:40:28] <guideX> $("#cmdMyButton").click(function () { ... alert("THAT ONE BUTTON CLICKED"); }
[13:40:57] <kaylee> and what if the user just hits enter in the text field to submit?
[13:41:07] <guideX> then the default button is clicked..
[13:41:22] <NoiseEee> kaylee: i guess a good question is WHY are there so many submit buttons?
[13:41:34] <NoiseEee> perhaps different buttons are better represented by a radio box selection.
[13:41:41] <NoiseEee> signifying the intention of the form
[13:41:49] <NoiseEee> s/box/button
[13:42:00] <Drager> Can I check the value in a rel? I do: $('div').attr('rel');
[13:42:06] <Drager> I want that rel value
[13:42:10] <NoiseEee> Drager: tias?
[13:42:21] <guideX> you can specify the default button in the form
[13:42:34] <Drager> NoiseEee: tias?
[13:42:38] <NoiseEee> try it and see.
[13:42:49] <kaylee> because the users have long since had a form that includes a text box and a single submit, and it performs a search
[13:42:51] <davemo> Drager: http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[13:43:11] <davemo> $("div").prop("rel")
[13:43:15] <kaylee> there's really not any point in making a duplicate of the text area, just so they can perform a different kind of search
[13:44:07] <kaylee> I suppose I could just use a radio or check box or something… but a different button is just seems like the simplest option
[13:44:47] <guideX> kaylee: the enter key should start the most basic search, the button should be redone as a dropdown button, where your different search criteria can be used (just an idea)
[13:45:17] <guideX> this way the user knows if they hit enter, they get default search, if they use the dropdown button, they get options
[13:45:26] <guideX> again just a design idea..
[13:45:28] <NoiseEee> kaylee: imo many different buttons all submitting is more confusing than a separate area specifying the intention of the search (<select>,<input type='radio'>, etc)
[13:47:04] <guideX> for instance, say they're searching for airports, hotels, or rental cars, but the default is all three..
[13:47:06] <kaylee> brb, got a different emergncy
[13:47:10] <guideX> ok
[13:47:15] <NoiseEee> put some butter on it
[13:47:28] <guideX> like hotwire.com :) god I love that site
[13:47:53] <shoky> HM: height:100%  on #inner  fixes it
[13:51:07] <HM> shoky: thank you!
[13:51:15] <HM> shoky: can you explain why this is necessary?
[13:51:26] <HM> i don;t see such a thing in any examples
[13:56:43] <kaylee> ok, sorry about that
[13:56:45] <kaylee> I'm back
[13:56:51] <lxsameer> i have a list of divs, how can i select one of them with an specific id ?
[13:57:21] <NoiseEee> lxsameer: the same way you'd select any element in the document.  $('#theID')
[13:57:29] <kaylee> guideX:  can you clarify "dropdown button"?
[13:57:54] <kaylee> and, yeah, I want enter and the existing button to perform the existing search functionaility
[13:58:00] <lxsameer> NoiseEee: hmm i want to filter the array
[13:58:33] <kaylee> and if they hit the other button, it still uses the input text, but performs a different flavor of the search
[13:58:49] <NoiseEee> kaylee: why not  <select name='searchPref'><option selected='selected'>Basic Search</option><option selected='selected'>Title Search</option><option selected='selected'>Another Search</option>
[13:58:54] <NoiseEee> kaylee: moar buttons = moar confusing
[13:59:24] * kaylee pouts I like buttons
[13:59:36] <NoiseEee> bad UI.
[13:59:40] <NoiseEee> anyways good luck :)
[14:00:35] <kaylee> I'm not sure I agree that it's bad ui in this case, but I'll concede and just add a damned radio
[14:01:37] <davemo> kaylee: try the extra buttons, see what users say
[14:01:41] <davemo> maybe it will work better than radios
[14:01:54] <kaylee> eh, they'll use whatever I tell them to use, for the most part
[14:02:02] <davemo> then do what you want! :)
[14:02:07] <davemo> if you like buttons, use buttons
[14:02:13] <kaylee> doesn't do me any good to give them the option of multiple buttons if I can't get the fucker to work like I want ;)
[14:02:14] <davemo> "best practices" be damned
[14:02:21] <davemo> haha
[14:03:30] <bekabug> can someone offer me some guidance on how to track down inline styles being set by jquery?
[14:03:40] <Ansikt> Hi, I want to do something similar to find, but which also checks the parent element.  I seem to remember a method like this, can anyone enlighten me on what it is?
[14:04:10] <Ansikt> bekabug:  The attr selector might help you
[14:04:14] <davemo> bekabug: using source control like git? you could git grep ".attr('style')"
[14:04:41] <bekabug> i have 2 identical themes on 2 different WordPress installations. the theme is not compatible with WP3.5. The theme that is working the inline style looks like: style="list-style: none; position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; z-index: 98; opacity: 0;".  The one that is broken looks like: "style="float: none; position: absolute; width: 100px; list-style: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; z-index: 0; display: none;"
[14:04:52] <Brodingo> bekabug look for methods in the css and manipulation sections of the docs
[14:05:10] <Ansikt> For example, I want to do $(this).find('.myClass');. and I want that to return the this element if the this element has myClass
[14:05:43] <theBrettman> Es0teric: how did you want them photos displayed? as little thumbnails or what? I know ways to make it work...
[14:06:14] <davemo> bekabug: are you on a unix machine? you can use the find command from the terminal to look for instances of ".attr('style'" or ".css("
[14:06:40] <bekabug> i'm on a mac but i can search the contents of all these files
[14:06:58] <davemo> yeah, mac works, just open a terminal, navigate to the directory you want to search in
[14:07:05] <dblosevn> Ansikt: youd do if ($(this).is('.myClass')) and $(this).find('.myClass') cant do both at once
[14:07:38] <Ansikt> dblosevn, thanks...what does $('.myclass',this) do?
[14:08:27] <dblosevn> not sure i would assume it would search `this` for '.myClass'
[14:09:00] <Ansikt> Would it search the top level or would it bascially be a shorthand for $(this).find(....
[14:09:03] <Caelum> is there anything that implements placeholder in IE8?
[14:09:14] <davemo> bekabug: cd /path/to/your/wordpress/folder
[14:09:24] <davemo> bekabug: grep -r ".attr('style'" .
[14:09:30] <davemo> bekabug: grep -r ".css(" .
[14:09:32] <dblosevn> ive never tried or even had knowledge of being able to pass a context in with a selector
[14:09:56] <bekabug> there's only 2 of attr('style ...and they are something else. there's about 857 instances of .css
[14:09:56] <Ansikt> Okay thanks.  Gonna see if this works.
[14:10:17] <davemo> bekabug: ouch, given it's a wordpress theme there are probably some jQuery plugins at work there
[14:10:39] <catcher> Anyone else use jquery address? I'm surprised there doesn't seem to be anything for differentiating named anchor links at the end of a url.  I wrote it in, but wondering if I'm missing something.
[14:10:52] <davemo> bekabug: could grep for "z-index: 98"
[14:10:56] <Es0teric> theBrettman i wanted to display them as thumbnails... they are really book covers
[14:12:02] <bekabug> that won't work because it's being set dynamically somehow
[14:12:15] <bekabug> 0 instances
[14:12:53] <bekabug> z-index: 99 looks promising :O
[14:13:07] <davemo> :D
[14:13:36] <bekabug> it's all in the style.css file though. would that be a possible?
[14:15:42] <sethetter> What does the "my" property of position in the jQuery dialog box refer to?
[14:15:56] <Conti> i'm using tinymce as an enhanced editor for some content that is displayed via a jquerymobile popup, but the <p>tags</p> in the content end up displayed within the popup, any ideas on why it is not displaying the enhanced html correctly? I've not been able to find anything through the documentation or google...
[14:16:07] <davemo> bekabug: not for an inline style
[14:16:11] <sethetter> Nevermind, figured it out.
[14:16:17] <Es0teric> also i have a click event, targeting a button -- now theres a getJSON in it, that generates elements, so i want the generated elements to remove every time a new getJSON request is fired
[14:18:07] <Conti> here is a screenshot to give a better representation of the problem http://i.imgur.com/u4TCHuz.png
[14:18:14] <Ansikt> If, for example, I had a jquery object representing many dom elements, and I wanted to remove those dom elements which were inside $(this), how would I go about that?
[14:18:16] <davemo> bekabug: it's gotta be in a .js file (or, possibly a .php file with js inline) :P
[14:18:18] <theBrettman> Es0teric: maybe the plugin has a create event and destroy event. make the thumbnails and use a click event to create the slideshow and destroy it when you're done to go back to thumbnails.
[14:18:27] <Conti> I've never had an issue with nested paragraph tags in the past, but this one seems stubborn
[14:19:22] <Es0teric> theBrettman well this is different... i generate the div for the slideshow with the getJSON request... but i have a array and i test the length to see if its more than 4 items, then generate the divs necessary for the slideshow
[14:21:36] <bekabug> that's what i thought. ok. i guess i'll just have to drag myself through all 800+ instances of .css( in jquery-slider_min.js
[14:21:41] <Fall> hi
[14:21:46] <bekabug> thanks for the point in the right direction though
[14:23:06] <Drager> In jqueryui I cannot chnage the inputs border? I tried .css('border', 'red'); but the border just disapear.
[14:24:09] <BillCriswell> Drager: border-color
[14:24:48] <Drager> BillCriswell: Thanks alot mate!
[14:25:10] <BillCriswell> Drager: No problem.
[14:31:02] <Ziber> I have a menu bar that may end up with a lot of items on it, which is aligned horizontally. I want to have a menu bar that can slide horizontally, and the label for it stays constant. http://www.jkode.us/captcha/ (click "jason kurtz")
[14:31:10] <Ziber> can anyone recommend a solution for that/
[14:36:21] <jrist> Ziber: heh, was trying to solve that myself via jquery.hoverscroll.js
[14:37:45] <sunbeam> i have this function
[14:37:48] <sunbeam> $('.meta_box_upload_image_button').click(function() {
[14:37:55] <sunbeam> but there is a problem
[14:38:03] <sunbeam> when a new .meta_box_upload_image_button is added
[14:38:17] <sunbeam> this .click(function() doesn't get triggered when i click on the real time new added link
[14:38:21] <sunbeam> how can i fix this?
[14:38:23] <systemfault> Then use event delegation instead of classic event handlers.
[14:38:56] <systemfault> Change the line to: $(document).on('click', '.meta_box_upload_image_button', function() { handleHere });
[14:39:40] <sunbeam> thanks a lot
[14:39:42] <Ziber> jrist: any luck?
[14:39:44] <sunbeam> systemfault: how does this work?
[14:39:48] <sunbeam> i mean, it works for me
[14:39:49] <sunbeam> but why
[14:39:54] <jrist> Ziber: well it works fine, not sure I like it though :)
[14:40:26] <systemfault> sunbeam: With normal event handling, you attach the handler to the selected elements.. so if you add a new one, you must manually reattach the event
[14:41:06] <shoky> HM: i think the examples all show running a nested .layout() on one of the actual panes of the outer layout. and indeed doing that also fixes your paste: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/DytRU/1/
[14:41:29] <systemfault> sunbeam: event delegation take advantage of a concept called "bubbling", it attaches the handler to some parent element (the document in my earlier example)
[14:41:41] <Ziber> jrist: mind showing me how it works in jsfiddle or something?
[14:41:49] <Ziber> or show me an example of it?
[14:41:53] <jrist> uh... hmm
[14:42:10] <jrist> Ziber: yeah sure lmgtfy being broken?
[14:42:10] <jrist> <jrist> there is no such thing
[14:42:12] <jrist> sdfasdf
[14:42:18] <jrist> oops
[14:42:20] <jrist> copy paste fail
[14:42:20] <jrist> http://rascarlito.free.fr/hoverscroll/
[14:42:25] <jrist> try that
[14:42:28] <jrist> it's easy to impl
[14:42:46] <systemfault> sunbeam: Then you you click on the element, the click event bubbles up the DOM tree, until it reaches "document".. then the handler on document verifies if the element clicked has the good selector.. if it's the case, the attached handler is called.
[14:47:15] <Ziber> jrist: Thanks. Would you happen to have the JS file that I could download though? I'm on a public computer and I can't seem to wget the URL that the downloader uses.
[14:48:21] <jrist> not following?
[14:49:13] <Ziber> jrist: I need a direct URL to wget it onto my server, since I can't currently download it because I'm on a public computer.
[14:49:37] <jrist> you can't unzip ?
[14:49:44] <jrist> http://rascarlito.free.fr/hoverscroll/download.php?get&version=0.2.4
[14:54:03] <anonychus> djQuery: please, i need jquery or jquery mobile for to build some as this: http://retaildemo1.openbravo.com/openbravo/web/org.openbravo.retail.posterminal/?terminal=VBS-1#login ?
[14:54:58] <Ziber> jrist: That URL doesn't directly go to an unzippable file.
[14:55:09] <jrist> sorry I dont' have it public, Ziber
[14:55:34] <djQuery> anonychus, so how much are you going to pay me
[14:55:51] <djQuery> your asking in a way that I believe that you have not done any of the work at all right now
[14:56:24] <sunbeam> systemfault: ok thanks
[14:56:30] <djQuery> you don't appear to have a specific question about it so that makes me feel that you want me to do all of the work
[14:56:40] <anonychus> djQuery: yes i im doing some examples
[14:57:28] <anonychus> but i don't know if for example i can to build this menus and lists as jquery, as openbravo pos application
[14:57:58] <anonychus> or which libraries or components i need to use?
[14:58:05] <djQuery> me neither
[14:58:36] <djQuery> but just looking at the homepage for open bravo it apears that it allready runs on tables
[14:58:39] <gkatsev> hey, anyone tried to do integration testing using qunit?
[14:59:20] <nextime> there is an amazin thing used by developers all around the world that help a lot in answer all of your question anonychus: it is called "documentation", usually in bundle with some demos too
[15:01:09] <dblosevn> dang i should check that documentation thing out sometime i would have never guessed
[15:01:34] <djQuery> realy where do they keep hiding these things
[15:01:54] <shoky> ?halp
[15:01:56] <bot-t> shoky, Couldn't find "halp" in jQuery Docs.
[15:02:27] <djQuery> gues we are getting to many smarties on here at the same time
[15:02:47] <whatever_42> hey guys. is anybody able to tell what i am doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/zWXEd/1/
[15:02:49] <anonychus> nextime: thanks, i know, but i would to know where i can find this examples types as menus
[15:03:54] <djQuery> whatever_42, see ?data
[15:03:54] <bot-t> whatever_42, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[15:04:04] <djQuery> $(this).parent().data("content");
[15:06:00] <dblosevn> whatever_42: http://jsfiddle.net/zWXEd/4/
[15:06:43] <dblosevn> abc is in the scope of the onload method, need to change the wrap to head also need to pass a reference to the button to the function since you chose not to use a callback in a click handler
[15:06:56] <muffinrecon> man speak in english :>
[15:07:18] <dblosevn> me?
[15:07:24] <muffinrecon> yeah
[15:07:39] <dblosevn> wow lol thought i did
[15:07:43] <djQuery> u did
[15:07:44] <muffinrecon> haha
[15:07:55] <djQuery> i undderstood it perfectly
[15:08:14] <muffinrecon> i didnt
[15:08:24] <muffinrecon> im a bad coder anyways :/
[15:08:30] <dblosevn> learn basic logic of programming then
[15:08:41] <Cronoh> read slower and understand each part
[15:08:52] <Cronoh> you might need an english class
[15:08:59] <dblosevn> me?
[15:09:03] <Cronoh> lol no not you
[15:09:12] <muffinrecon> :/
[15:09:20] <dblosevn> lol i type like i would speak and that confuses people sometimes
[15:09:40] <djQuery> ?eloguent
[15:09:42] <bot-t> djQuery, Couldn't find "eloguent" in jQuery Docs.
[15:09:49] <djQuery> ?eloquent

[15:10:30] <muffinrecon> oh cool
[15:10:33] <muffinrecon> you guys have a bot
[15:10:37] <muffinrecon> ?wuddup
[15:10:38] <bot-t> muffinrecon, Couldn't find "wuddup" in jQuery Docs.
[15:10:41] <muffinrecon> xD
[15:10:57] <dblosevn> how bout this.... The function abc() is in the scope of the Jquery.onLoad handler. This needs to be moved to the global scope to be referenced after onLoad completes. Also being your not using a click handler you will need to pass a reference to the button into the function abc hence abc(this).
[15:11:26] <dblosevn> is that English enough?
[15:11:39] <muffinrecon> not even close
[15:11:41] <muffinrecon> xD
[15:12:05] <whatever_42> well thank you
[15:12:10] <dblosevn> np
[15:12:26] <dblosevn> no help exists for muffinrecon i fear
[15:13:26] <dblosevn> papajohns needs to update there database i hate having to pick up the phone to order and losing the online promos just because the website thinks they dont deliver to me
[15:13:50] <muffinrecon> :D
[15:13:54] <djQuery> yeah I hate it when I get a customer that complains about that too
[15:14:10] <djQuery> heck we are still using terminal computers at most stores
[15:14:22] <muffinrecon> you need ot hook me up with free pizza man
[15:14:26] <muffinrecon> jeez
[15:14:34] <muffinrecon> you got all that power and you're not using it
[15:14:43] <djQuery> muffinrecon, they are running a coin flip thing right now
[15:14:43] <dblosevn> i got like 4 free pizzas i cant claim cause they claim not to deliver to me
[15:14:47] <djQuery> sign up twice
[15:15:01] <djQuery> when you sign up the first time pick heads

[15:15:59] <djQuery> and don't forget to tip your driver or he may post a lemon party for your address on craigs list
[15:16:34] <djQuery> no realy I would never do that
[15:16:42] <dblosevn> i guess they closed the store that used to deliver here and expanded the dellivery area of another to compensate for it
[15:17:00] <dblosevn> but never updated the site
[15:17:25] <djQuery> no its a glitch the system allways looses your discount when you modify your order via the store
[15:17:38] <d4rklit3> Uncaught Error: Method "[object Window]" does not exist
[15:17:42] <d4rklit3> anyone know what that means
[15:17:47] <dblosevn> i cant modify the order that it wont let me place
[15:17:50] <d4rklit3> im trying to do $(window).resize(function)
[15:18:04] <systemfault> d4rklit3: you tried with "window" or "Window"?
[15:18:08] <djQuery> is it window or Window
[15:18:12] <d4rklit3> window
[15:18:14] <systemfault> It's "window"
[15:18:19] <djQuery> javascript case sensitive
[15:18:24] <d4rklit3> i know im using "window"
[15:18:29] <d4rklit3> all lowercase
[15:18:57] <dblosevn> ?demo @ d4rklit3
[15:18:57] <bot-t> d4rklit3, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:19:14] <dblosevn> theres no reason that wont work got to see it to help you
[15:20:05] <d4rklit3> i see
[15:20:07] <d4rklit3> it was a backbone
[15:20:11] <d4rklit3> issue
[15:20:32] <dblosevn> i hate it when my backbone gives me issues

[15:42:19] <fission6> is there a way to check if an object has a key
[15:44:31] <systemfault> myObject.hasOwnProperty(key) or if (key in myObject)?

[15:50:28] <sunbeam> whats the best way to display a youtube video in lightbox?
[15:55:19] <BulleTime> hi guys i asked before but why doesnt my td and the a inside it dont show correct .height value?
[16:02:01] <Dave_Stein> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13341 :( womp wah
[16:05:52] <morphine> <div id="a"> tables here <div id="b"> more tables here </div> </div>
[16:06:03] <morphine> I want a selector that grabs me all tables inside A but not inside B
[16:06:17] <morphine> I had this: $("#a table") - but this doesn't exclude tables inside B
[16:06:47] <djQuery> $(
[16:06:57] <djQuery> $('#a>table')
[16:06:59] <acconrad> is there a cleaner way of writing var x = y ? y : 0
[16:07:19] <djQuery> x=y||0
[16:07:32] <acconrad> djQuery: beautiful, thank you!
[16:08:06] <morphine> djQuery: that would work, but in some cases there's other stuff around the table tags (but not inside B)
[16:08:15] <morphine> like <p> tags and whatnot
[16:08:34] <djQuery> morphine, well that gets combersome
[16:08:44] <morphine> heh right, I know
[16:08:49] <morphine> I was trying to use filter()
[16:08:52] <djQuery> can you modify the tables to have a class that you can select on or something
[16:09:49] <sunbeam> whats the best way to display a youtube video in lightbox?
[16:10:07] <morphine> djQuery: perhaps, I'm seeing if not() helps, sec
[16:10:13] <djQuery> $('#a tables').filter('function(){if ($(this).closes(''$b').length > 0){ return false; }})
[16:10:32] <morphine> ah, I found it
[16:10:39] <morphine> $("#a table").not("#b table")
[16:10:42] <morphine> hacky, but works
[16:10:48] <djQuery> morphine, typo $('#a tables').filter('function(){if ($(this).closest(''$b').length > 0){ return false; }})
[16:10:54] <morphine> thanks anyway though, you got me on the right track
[16:11:37] <djQuery> 2 down
[16:11:41] <djQuery> back to movie
[16:12:01] <morphine> heh
[16:12:24] <djQuery> morphine, hope you don't have  a lot of those as I am not sure how it would preform speed wise
[16:12:37] <morphine> nah, we're talking a half dozen at most
[16:12:50] <morphine> besides, any file with hundreds of tables would be...
[16:12:54] <morphine> ... in need of fixing
[16:12:55] <morphine> heh
[16:13:08] <djQuery> fixing ie removing tables
[16:13:21] <morphine> aye
[16:13:43] <djQuery> only thing worse than a page with tables is a page with lotsa tables
[16:20:14] <amh345> is there a way to make a hover an img src fade when src swaps?  http://jsfiddle.net/46abk/
[16:20:47] <FritzB> Hi everyone!
[16:21:01] <_Andrei_> hi FritzB
[16:21:16] <_Andrei_> looking at your snippet amh345
[16:22:33] <amh345> _Andrei_: yes?
[16:24:16] <FritzB> I have a really novice question. Can someone point me in the right direction to see how to pass a value from the client to a controller action using jquery? I know how to check if a checkbox is true or false, but how can I send this to the action  method?
[16:24:31] <_Andrei_> i'm not a jquery ninja, but, if you have the trigger that swaps the attribut, you can add whatever other effect (as fade) on whatever handle you need (others img)
[16:25:09] <kamoricks> FritzB: On the server? $.ajax
[16:25:21] <_Andrei_> i make that for simulating accordicons
[16:26:01] <_Andrei_> in the same { } first the swap, than the fades
[16:26:12] <amh345> _Andrei_: it fades on into the other?
[16:26:19] <amh345> or fades one out completely?
[16:26:25] <amh345> and than fades in the other?
[16:26:49] <nextime> is there a way to have a "transition like" effect using rel="external" for links in jquerymobile?
[16:27:08] <kamoricks> FritzB: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[16:27:13] <_Andrei_> i guess, it fades whatever you tell jquery to fade, based on #id as example
[16:27:36] <_Andrei_> or listen to kamoricks  ;)
[16:27:59] <_Andrei_> got to go anyway ... was a long day here
[16:28:04] <FritzB> thanks!
[16:28:08] <_Andrei_> bye

[16:29:01] <Caelum> found how to make placeholder work on ie8: http://webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/cross-browser-html5-placeholder-text/comment-page-2
[16:31:39] <amh345> listen to kamoricks ?  i must have missed what they said
[16:32:30] <Visaudi> Can anyone recommend some good examples of sites that resize their background images well?
[16:32:56] <Visaudi> Or just well written source I can study?
[16:36:27] <Visaudi> Am I using this channel right?  I'm sorry this my first time here and I don't really know what the conventions are.
[16:40:52] <davemo> OliverJAsh:
[16:40:57] <davemo> oops, typo
[16:41:34] <amh345> anyone have any tips on how to make this image replace do a smooth transition? http://jsfiddle.net/46abk/
[16:47:32] <davemo> amh345: use a css3 transition if the browser supports it, and transition the opacity property
[16:47:48] <amh345> what about people who dont have css3?
[16:48:04] <amh345> is it even possible to do a smooth transition with a src swap
[16:48:54] <davemo> you could crossfade between 2 images
[16:49:13] <davemo> have them both in place, visible, but z-index the top one above the bottom, then as you hover just fadeout the top
[16:49:26] <davemo> reverse the fadeout to reappear the top image
[16:49:43] <davemo> seems that would be smoother than swapping the .src attr
[16:49:51] <davemo> s/.src/'src'
[16:54:46] <mendes> hello guys , anyone using isotope? how can i get by a url to a filetered gallery?
[16:54:51] <mendes> filtered *
[16:55:21] <coldhead> mendes: i think you need to catch the URL and filter it yourself
[16:55:38] <mendes> how coldhead?
[16:55:52] <coldhead> something like how it's done here http://sophieelinor.com/quaver.html#digital
[16:56:10] <mendes> im using wordpress and its not working
[16:56:40] <coldhead> isotope is tricky
[16:56:54] <mendes> can you help me? please
[16:57:17] <garbagecollectio> d
[16:57:19] <coldhead> but you basically want if (something_in_the_url) { isotope({ filter:'somefilter' }) }
[16:58:11] <mendes> im a noob in jquery can we pvt?
[16:58:52] <coldhead> you might want to put isotope back on the shelf then, it's a lot of trouble
[16:59:05] <coldhead> it's pretty much my first day using jQuery
[17:00:17] <mendes> ok, thank you anyway... some one with isotope skills?

[17:50:06] <DC> I am writing a image browser thing where there are three images displayed at a time. Where you click either write or left and the images go in that direction. But when I wrote this function the images dont take the previous image and then update the first image. It just puts the first image on every image and doesn't update the first one. Please help. Here is the code sample. http://pastebin.com/spc4XxUW  Here is the entire code. http://pa
[17:51:45] <dmmd> can't see the "entire code" link. please post this link again

[17:55:54] <dmmd> DC your issue is just with the FIRST image?
[17:56:06] <Es0teric> ok so i have multiple items in an array, but i want to take every 4 items and put them in a new div based on the amount of items in the array... how do i do that?
[17:57:18] <DC> dmmd: The issue is with the if (b_right == true)  method. The first image doesnt seem to update. But when I click it once the second image does that the first image. But the first image doesnt change. And the third image doesnt take the second image like I wanted it to.
[17:58:30] <coldhead> ?mdc splice @ Es0teric
[17:58:33] <bot-t> Es0teric, Array splice method - JavaScript | MDN - Changes the content of an array, adding new elements while removing old elements. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice
[17:58:50] <coldhead> you can use that to remove 4 items at a time from your array
[17:59:10] <Es0teric> coldhead, do i need to do that in a $.each() statement?
[17:59:19] <Es0teric> *loop
[17:59:36] <coldhead> no, i would use a while
[18:00:01] <coldhead> while (var four = all_entries.splice(0, 4)) {
[18:00:04] <coldhead> or something like that
[18:00:44] <Es0teric> coldhead i will try that, thanks
[18:01:39] <dblosevn_> Es0teric: http://pastebin.com/iXFFDamb
[18:02:07] <dblosevn_> i like coldheads betta though didnt think of slice
[18:02:42] <dmmd> DC looking into it
[18:03:05] <DC> dmmd: Thank you.
[18:05:17] <dismist> how can i use jquery to get the URL of what a GET based form would be after it is submitted
[18:05:29] <dismist> do i have to iterate through all possible form elements
[18:06:31] <coldhead> ?serialize
[18:06:31] <bot-t> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[18:06:34] <Es0teric> thanks, dblosevn_
[18:06:41] <dblosevn_> np
[18:12:23] <Es0teric> dblosevn_ quick question though... if i use .slice() and i want to append multiple images in a div before creating a new div and adding images there, how would that work?
[18:12:46] <dblosevn_> Es0teric: I forgot to reset counter inside of the if block add counter = 0; before the end of the if block
[18:13:27] <dmmd> DC sorry... I'm back
[18:13:47] <DC> dmmd: That is okay I am still here too.
[18:14:10] <dmmd> DC the problem here is that you need to check if the value is going below 0 or above image.length
[18:14:40] <dmmd> you're trying to access an unexistent position on the "image" array
[18:14:44] <djQuery> too bad theres no way to do '<div/>'*4
[18:14:57] <DC> dmmd: If that is the case. Then shouldn't it work the first few time. Since I added 9 things to the array.
[18:15:56] <dmmd> the first time you hit "left", the i_imgDesc variable gets a negative value
[18:16:18] <dmmd> i_imgDesc -= 1;
[18:16:21] <DC> dmmd: I was only hitting right though. I was planning on adding those safeguards later.
[18:16:36] <DC> dmmd: After I got right to work.
[18:17:57] <dmmd> DC, try playing around with this http://jsbin.com/orocel/1/
[18:18:09] <DC> dmmd: Okay I will
[18:28:21] <DC> dmmd: I played around with it. For some reason book2_image and book3_image do not get the .text from this   $('#book2_image').text( document.getElementById("book1_image").text); Is there any other way to do the same thing?
[18:28:39] <dmmd> I've updated that...
[18:28:42] <dmmd> 1 sec
[18:29:16] <dmmd> DC open http://jsbin.com/orocel/1/edit again
[18:30:33] <DC> dmmd:  Oh okay I see.
[18:31:53] <leaetmika> hi guys
[18:32:10] <leaetmika> is this possible to set a dynamic position to an element according to the size and position of another element
[18:33:34] <coldhead> sure, why not
[18:34:41] <guy> $('#posters').sortable('destroy');
[18:34:50] <guy> doesn't actually return items to pre initiation state
[18:34:56] <guy> (though docs say they do)
[18:35:23] <djQuery> guy, go look at the bugs and see if there is anything on that
[18:36:17] <djQuery> guy, http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/10?P=sortable
[18:37:35] <guy> djQuery: am I a supposed to find something, because I don't see any related bug
[18:38:20] <djQuery> guy, I had'nt looked yet myself
[18:38:39] <djQuery> guy, workin on a couple button bugs myself
[18:40:14] <amh345> does anyone have any tips on how to make this image replace do a smooth transition? http://jsfiddle.net/46abk/ is it possible to do a smooth transition on a src swap?   im helping a buddy update a 3rd party site.. and adding any kind of html/css creates so many problems.
[18:40:16] <Es0teric> damn this is not coming out the way i want it to
[18:40:19] <guy> "Removes the sortable functionality completely. This will return the element back to its pre-init state."
[18:40:30] <Es0teric> this splice() method is not inserting every four images from the array
[18:40:45] <guy> I highly doubt if documentation is right.. ie, this doesn't seem like jQuery UI bug, but rather error in the documentation.
[18:40:52] <djQuery> guy, give me a demo real quick see ?demo
[18:40:52] <bot-t> guy, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:41:16] <guy> djQuery: https://dev.anuary.com/3b61ac24-93d8-57a3-a25d-242e4a40530e/
[18:41:39] <scar> if i have a class that is on a <select>, how can i grab the HTML value of the current selected option?
[18:41:41] <guy> when page is loaded, move around the posters (sortable will automatically destroy itself after 5 seconds)
[18:41:47] <SrPx> Does anyone know how to set a callback for ESC keypress? I'm not getting $.keydown for it!
[18:42:12] <guy> SrPx: look for keypress event.
[18:42:21] <guy> disclaimer: just a guess.
[18:43:04] <djQuery> ?keypress
[18:43:04] <bot-t> .keypress(handler): Bind an event handler to the "keypress" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/keypress/
[18:43:14] <guy> djQuery: forget it. it is not a bug.
[18:43:27] <guy> documentation is ambiguous though
[18:44:22] <djQuery> SrPx, doesnt look like keypress can catch esc
[18:45:02] <scar> nevermind, just used .class option:selected
[18:45:02] <scar> :D
[18:45:14] <djQuery> SrPx, actualy it has to be able to as the dialog widget captures it when in modal mode
[18:46:19] <djQuery> SrPx, seems to be an issue between different browsers when using keydown with esc
[18:46:28] <djQuery> try using keyup instead
[18:47:14] <guy> yup, keyup wokrs.
[18:47:17] <guy> works
[18:49:48] <hip2p> $(document).click("contextmenu", function(event) { allows me to produce a custom right click menu. Why can't I replace document with a div id so the custom menu only appears when I right click within the div?
[18:52:25] <scar> i am using .on("focus, click") on a read-only textbox, and the function will then scroll up to a specific div. when text is accidentally seleted inside the box, the browser wants to always keep scrolling me to the destination.
[18:52:29] <scar> is there a way to counter this?
[18:53:00] <scar> http://pastebin.com/k2JReDFg
[18:54:11] <scar> i suppose i could unfocus it
[18:54:21] <scar> blur
[18:57:33] <djQuery> hip2p, did you see this http://www.webdeveloperjuice.com/2010/02/22/create-simple-jquery-right-click-cross-browser-vertical-menu/
[18:58:41] <Es0teric> this .splice() or .slice() method is not working for me even with a while loop
[18:58:44] <djQuery> they are just returning false so that it doesnt bubble up to the document
[18:59:33] <djQuery> Es0teric, you do know that jquery doesnt have a splice function right
[18:59:43] <djQuery> that is the native javascript function
[18:59:46] <hip2p> djQuery thanks I'll look
[18:59:46] <Es0teric> djQuery isnt it slice()
[18:59:47] <Es0teric> ?
[19:00:36] <djQuery> ok it does have a slice method
[19:00:51] <hip2p> djQuery it looks like they're binding to the document.ready
[19:01:13] <djQuery> hip2p, yeah thats where they put all there code
[19:01:32] <hip2p> yeah but as I said I have no problem binding to the document. My issue is I can't bind to elements like a div
[19:01:35] <djQuery> hip2p, thats SOP for just about any jquery code
[19:01:56] <djQuery> the context menu is bound to the div not the document
[19:02:06] <Es0teric> djQuery lol
[19:02:09] <djQuery> you do know what ready is right?
[19:02:25] <hip2p> yeah
[19:02:55] <djQuery> if you want you can just do (function($){}(jQuery););
[19:03:04] <djQuery> and put your code between the {}
[19:03:30] <hip2p> maybe I'm reading the code wrong, but it looks like it's binding to the document and not to the div "overlay"
[19:04:01] <djQuery> hip2p, how so $('#rightclickarea').bind('contextmenu',function(e){
[19:04:11] <hip2p> djQuery yeah that's what I want
[19:04:23] <hip2p> doesn't do anything for me, though
[19:05:06] <hip2p> $(document).bind("contextmenu", function(event) { works fine for me, but replacing the document with "#div1" doesn't
[19:05:10] <djQuery> hip2p, see ?demo
[19:05:10] <bot-t> hip2p, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:05:18] <hip2p> ok one sec
[19:05:57] <djQuery> Es0teric, demo to you to slice looks pretty straight forward to me ?demo
[19:11:55] <hip2p> djQuery I figured out my problem. thanks
[19:12:56] <djQuery> hip2p, usualy having to make the demo cuases you to catch it
[19:13:31] <hip2p> yeah
[19:15:13] <GoSox> I am getting errors in the console that I don't know how to interpret. my very very short script is not doing functioning. And the console says "Unexpected token '<' on line one
[19:15:24] <GoSox> then Can't find variable: $
[19:15:39] <Es0teric> djQuery http://jsfiddle.net/SB8D6/1/
[19:17:14] <djQuery> Es0teric, t.slice(0, 4).each()
[19:17:30] <Es0teric> djQuery what?
[19:17:53] <Es0teric> i dont want to create a new .slides_container every 4 items
[19:18:13] <Es0teric> also, i just want to group every 4, what about odd numbers?
[19:18:27] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net/A4gDH/
[19:18:47] <Es0teric> i just want to append a new div with 4 items in .slides_container
[19:20:18] <djQuery> Es0teric, did you click the jshint button?
[19:20:43] <Es0teric> djQuery no
[19:23:09] <djQuery> Es0teric, 2nd the t.slice(0,4) is a javascript function not a jquery function as t is not a jquery object
[19:23:37] <Es0teric> djQuery wait what?
[19:23:40] <djQuery> $(t).slice(0,4) would be using the jquery one but it looks like the implimentation is about the same
[19:23:43] <Es0teric> its an array of objects
[19:23:58] <djQuery> but not jquery objects just normal objects
[19:24:03] <Es0teric> oh i see.. i have to wrap it around jquery
[19:25:22] <hip2p> http://jsfiddle.net/YKW4V/ <<< right click on hello, then left click on option 2, and an alert box comes up. AS LONG as jquery is set to version 1.8.3 or earlier... why doesn't it work in 1.9.0 or later?
[19:26:07] <djQuery> it is displayed when you do that
[19:26:23] <broncos42> Im new to this, how come when I go to download jQuery it just goes to a javascript page???
[19:26:31] <djQuery> wait
[19:26:34] <hip2p> djQuery even with jquery 1.9.0?
[19:26:55] <djQuery> broncos42, evidently your new to browsers as well
[19:27:04] <djQuery> right click and choose save as or what not
[19:27:41] <broncos42> ah ok, I figured. Wasnt sure if I was getting all I needed and what not. Thanks!
[19:27:43] <hip2p> djQuery, apparently .live doesn't work in 1.9.0: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14458511/livefunction-and-jquery-browser-is-undefined-in-jquery-1-9-0
[19:28:05] <djQuery> no live is gone you need to use the new on
[19:28:09] <djQuery> its better
[19:28:12] <hip2p> ok
[19:30:19] <djQuery> $(document.body).on('click', '.custom-menu li', function(){ console.log(this.text); $(this).closest('.custom-menu').remove()});})
[19:30:32] <djQuery> hip2p, ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ or something like that
[19:30:52] <djQuery> hip2p, see how I made just 1 function for all of them
[19:31:56] <hip2p> hmm, in the code I posted, if I change live() to on(), it still doesn't work in 1.9
[19:32:10] <hip2p> http://jsfiddle.net/YKW4V/1/
[19:32:32] <djQuery> syntax is  a little diffent with on did you see my example
[19:32:43] <hip2p> sorry didn't see that
[19:32:58] <hip2p> ah I see now, thanks
[19:36:34] <Es0teric> djQuery i still dont get this man
[19:36:44] <djQuery> Es0teric, give me a min
[19:37:17] <Es0teric> djQuery iite
[19:37:45] <amh345> i've managed to get a hover transition that smoothly fades in a button.  only thing is if i pull out too quick on the hover everything breaks. http://jsfiddle.net/46abk/2/    the entire image disappears and the hover out doesnt get to complete.   is there a way to force this?
[19:38:09] <djQuery> Es0teric, something like this http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/SB8D6/3/
[19:38:46] <Es0teric> djQuery what is the <div /> for? or the <a /> for?
[19:38:50] <Es0teric> why not just do <a>
[19:39:14] <tw2113> i don't think either of those tags are self closing
[19:39:14] <djQuery> Es0teric, habbit
[19:39:30] <Es0teric> so those tags self close?
[19:39:38] <djQuery> just fix it
[19:39:51] <djQuery> dont know why the images arent showing
[19:40:00] <djQuery> viewing the source they are there
[19:40:17] <Es0teric> djQuery question... what if theres an odd number of items?
[19:40:29] <p0rk> .on('click') should still fire if the element was added after page load, right?
[19:40:34] <Es0teric> tw2113 which tags actually self close though?
[19:40:41] <djQuery> p0rk, yes
[19:40:52] <p0rk> hmm
[19:40:54] <p0rk> its not
[19:40:57] <tw2113> you'd have to check the spec
[19:41:07] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/SB8D6/4/
[19:41:33] <djQuery> very few tags are self closing and even fewer have to be closed at all in html5 specs
[19:42:19] <p0rk> djQuery, it works prior to the element being inserts via ajax, but not after
[19:42:29] <djQuery> <input > is valid in html5
[19:42:47] <djQuery> ?demo@p0rk
[19:42:47] <bot-t> p0rk, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:43:02] <p0rk> do you mind if i pm it you?
[19:43:07] <djQuery> yes
[19:43:13] <p0rk> ok
[19:43:18] <p0rk> well thanks anyway
[19:43:23] <djQuery> no one else learns or contributes that way
[19:43:26] <p0rk> yea
[19:43:29] <p0rk> the sites not live yet though
[19:43:40] <p0rk> so i dont want to just give the link out to 819~ people
[19:43:51] <djQuery> then put toghtether a simple example instead of the whole site
[19:46:11] <Es0teric> djQuery its still displaying the images in individual divs... i wanted to group every 4 images in one div
[19:46:16] <Es0teric> not each image in a seperate div
[19:47:13] <djQuery> hmmm you need to do a seperate loop and keep track of the ending point
[19:49:00] <djQuery> round t.length/4 down
[19:49:29] <djQuery> then subtract t.length./4 from t.length   to get the last bit if there was a remainder
[19:49:44] <djQuery> the key is that now you know how to loop through them
[19:52:04] <djQuery> or you could just you a ul and li and tell it to wrap in the container wich would be a lot easier
[19:52:23] <djQuery> and also scale to the page better
[19:52:44] <djQuery> heck then you dont even need slice
[19:53:10] <djQuery> but i still dont knwo what you end goal is so I am just talking out my ....
[19:54:31] <Es0teric> djQuery my end goal is to make it work with slidesjs
[19:54:52] <Es0teric> all of that is for book covers, so i would paginate each book cover by 4's and put them on a shelf
[19:56:37] <theBrettman> ok so I'm using wordpress and I can make a list of images that I want to be in a page inside of an element, how I turn that element into a page for later use when they click on the button?
[19:57:19] <Es0teric> djQuery so basically, it would put 4 images in a slide if i group them together in one div
[19:57:33] <coldhead> TALKING OUT YOUR WHAT
[19:57:36] <coldhead> YOU JUST TRAILED OFF
[19:58:00] <Es0teric> lol coldhead
[19:58:25] <tw2113> wat?
[19:59:02] <djQuery> Es0teric, give me a little while sounds intresting,
[19:59:14] <Es0teric> ok djQuery
[20:01:02] <theBrettman> ohai gais! haven't seen you in a bit
[20:04:44] <crawfish> Hola
[20:05:45] <theBrettman> tryin to learn this jquery mobile stuff... it was all fun with data attributes till stuff wasn't working and I have to learn all the methods and properties of the whole mobile object :/
[20:06:58] <crawfish> good luck
[20:14:25] <amh345> can anyone help with my question from earlier? i've managed to get a hover transition that smoothly fades in a button.  only thing is if i pull out too quick on the hover everything breaks. http://jsfiddle.net/46abk/2/    the entire image disappears and the hover out doesnt get to complete.  is there a way to force this?
[20:26:17] <Es0teric> what the hell...
[20:26:19] <Es0teric> for some reason
[20:26:42] <Es0teric> this comes out as undefined
[20:27:17] <snuggs> I have a question pertaining to possibly everyone in this room.  This is in fact regards to jQuery so please bare with me.  When in college or Highschool did you find yourselves study for tests and subjects using index cards?
[20:27:39] <snuggs> (flash cards)
[20:28:53] <snuggs> yes or no will do fine.  If you had photographic memory or some other valuable nemonic tool that would be an answer as well
[20:30:02] <coldhead> i never used flash cards
[20:30:04] <snuggs> well I did.  I found memorization very helpful and I would like to see what percentage of this room did as well
[20:30:10] <coldhead> who has the time to manage bits of paper
[20:30:56] <coldhead> the only time i used anything like flashcards is when i stared at a high speed loop of photos of brooke satchwell on acid for hours
[20:31:06] <snuggs> quick visual repetitiveness was successful for me in memorization
[20:31:27] <coldhead> depends what you're learning i suppose
[20:32:11] <snuggs> right now I'm basically noting what i did in college (biology, physics, astronomy anything basically.)
[20:32:25] <snuggs> my question is because I find memorization the best tool for the job
[20:33:04] <coldhead> i imagine it's good for learning "facts" more than learning analysis or logic
[20:33:08] <tw2113> i am not making the jQuery connection, but it's a quiet time in here
[20:33:09] <greg5green> no
[20:33:19] <snuggs> and if we were to develop an online flashcard tool that could be printed out regarding methods, queries, api calls and etc. regarding jQuery I'd like to know if anyone would benefit from it
[20:33:44] <coldhead> see i learn those better through use rather than having their names "flash" at me
[20:33:51] <snuggs> i want to build it for beginners and such but i'd like to know if it would come to use
[20:34:23] <coldhead> even if it helps you memorise the arguments to ajax() you still need to actually use it to master the nuances
[20:35:14] <snuggs> i remember diligently searching high and low for flash cards and ways of studying js, ruby and php much like i did in school and nothing was around because the scope of the work was so small in ration of the interest in the public eye
[20:35:22] <tw2113> i think it's better to memorize quality sources of documentation more than memorizing every single parameter for various things
[20:35:58] <coldhead> plus a lot of those things i would prefer not to memorise, and instead look them up quickly
[20:36:18] <snuggs> but i felt the same way about the topics i studied in college
[20:36:19] <coldhead> that leaves my brain free to memorise more important things like my menstrual cycle
[20:36:32] <snuggs> why would i want to know this? let me just look it up
[20:36:47] <snuggs> but not only an hour of flash cards and I would ace any test
[20:37:05] <snuggs> now that was for a subject I had little interest in
[20:37:10] <tw2113> as you start to use stuff more frequently, the pararmeters will come to you more naturally
[20:37:38] <snuggs> In development, I find myself reading and reading blogs, books, and watching seminars to stay on top
[20:37:46] <coldhead> flash cards won't help you construct a proof as to why fermat's little theorem proves the secrecy of a message encrypted with a given key length
[20:38:03] <snuggs> what if we had a flash card system that pulled in realtime information in the news
[20:38:19] <coldhead> if YOU think it would be useful, snuggs, there are sure to be other people who would feel the same way
[20:38:23] <tw2113> learn the concepts more than the specifics of certain parts
[20:38:23] <coldhead> so you should probably bother
[20:38:54] <snuggs> i considered using the yql
[20:39:02] <snuggs> however I don't know how long that may be applicable
[20:39:08] <tw2113> i think something that doesn't get emphasized enough is the idea of input/process/output
[20:40:33] <tw2113> take some input of some sort, do something with it, then display/save
[20:40:38] <snuggs> if a bookmarking system was built on information alone and allowing someone to retain that information than i see it as a valuable resource
[20:40:59] <snuggs> id like to build it as an gnu license
[20:41:05] <snuggs> build a community
[20:41:11] <snuggs> under
[20:41:29] <tw2113> one thing i recall from my programming classes was that books were allowed during tests
[20:41:39] <tw2113> because in a real job, you'd have them on your shelf ready to use
[20:41:49] <snuggs> i wouldn't want to partake on this journey though if people think they couldn't benefit from it as I would
[20:41:58] <coldhead> you must have been at a community college, tw2113
[20:42:05] <snuggs> i had that in certain subjects
[20:42:08] <tw2113> public university
[20:42:11] <snuggs> they weren't allowed in my visual classes
[20:42:15] <coldhead> i think something that doesn't get emphasized enough is formal logic
[20:42:29] <snuggs> i went to psu
[20:42:53] <tw2113> i want to go to PCU http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110759/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1
[20:42:57] <snuggs> hahah
[20:43:02] <snuggs> don't' we all
[20:43:04] <snuggs> didnt'*
[20:43:12] <scar> is there a way to get custom terms that contain NO posts/cpt for a specific day?
[20:43:36] <tw2113> wrong room scar ?
[20:43:39] <scar> oh
[20:43:41] <scar> yup
[20:43:53] <scar> xchat migration curve =P
[20:44:18] <djQuery> back now
[20:44:21] <coldhead> good luck with that, scar!
[20:44:21] <tw2113> no idea how to query for post meta for days that have no date
[20:44:25] <coldhead> welcome back djQ
[20:44:40] <tw2113> wait
[20:44:52] <tw2113> eh, fleeting thought
[20:44:54] <scar> tw2113, no, query taxonomy terms for a specific date
[20:44:55] <scar> lol
[20:45:05] <snuggs> well like I said, I know its a major undertaking.  At first I was just thinking about manual printing the information when i figured what better than realtime algorithmic filtered content
[20:45:09] <djQuery> Es0teric, you get it yet?
[20:45:13] <tw2113> so you want to query by date?
[20:45:50] <tw2113> snuggs, my only thought is that you have a lot of competition of jQuery resources
[20:46:05] <snuggs> competition isn't a problem
[20:46:10] <scar> well, yes. i have taxonomy of times, and when someone books that time i want it to go away... so i tried get_terms using hide_empty => 0
[20:46:19] <snuggs> I'm not looking to profit from it
[20:46:39] <snuggs> i want to help build the development community as they have helped me
[20:46:56] <coldhead> the biggesst burden with jQuery documentation is keeping it current
[20:46:57] <snuggs> i've learned more from the web myself then the 80,000 + dollars I spent in college
[20:46:58] <scar> not sure payload of running loop of queries
[20:47:08] <tw2113> scar, chances are i'd set a meta field when someone chooses said date
[20:47:16] <tw2113> and just query for if the meta field exists or not
[20:47:27] <scar> tw2113, problem is, there's no post to set that meta field to
[20:47:29] <scar> lol
[20:47:30] <snuggs> this isn't a profitable plan to bring in vc's
[20:47:44] <tw2113> how is the selected date being stored?
[20:47:51] <snuggs> this is to build a resource that people can use in a physical sense
[20:48:11] <snuggs> I'm so for bringing technology to a physical presence these days
[20:48:14] <scar> multiple ways. i set the post publish date / time AND set it via meta key to test... but when im querying the 4 times per hour in an 8 hour day.... thats lots of queries
[20:48:20] <snuggs> i want to so much break away from the screen
[20:48:26] <tw2113> physical stuff is harder to keep uptodate snuggs
[20:49:15] <snuggs> tw2113: you have toliet paper that can be printed out for you with your custom tweets!!! how about something you can print and benefit from
[20:49:20] <tw2113> query for the posts and if it returns nothing, do something else?
[20:49:27] <coldhead> in the year of eighty one
[20:49:41] <snuggs> take that thinking and apply it to a logical sense
[20:49:48] <scar> tw2113, 32 queries each time someon clicks the date? is that inefficient?
[20:49:50] <scar> lol
[20:50:02] <tw2113> real-time tweet printing or does it take time to get them snuggs
[20:50:21] <snuggs> we are the nations future.  if not we need to rely on all the overseas vendors
[20:50:46] <snuggs> tw2113 I apologize for not knowing where you are from
[20:50:50] <snuggs> I'm from ny
[20:50:51] <tw2113> pluto
[20:51:19] <snuggs> i hate to see our jobs being handed off to machines because people are afraid of syntax
[20:52:04] <tw2113> given how fast things change these days, i find printed materials not always the most effective tool of education
[20:52:05] <snuggs> i want to help the tutorial, information, self-help community and build a technological realtime resource tool that will assist
[20:52:09] <tw2113> especially in web development
[20:52:15] <snuggs> in the general public license
[20:52:23] <tw2113> public domain and the internet
[20:52:32] <tw2113> if you want real time
[20:52:36] <tw2113> printed materials are not that
[20:52:45] <snuggs> real time via printed and digital
[20:52:51] <snuggs> pull it up html5
[20:52:57] <snuggs> print it out via sheets
[20:53:10] <snuggs> simple css print stylesheet or something
[20:53:15] <snuggs> haven't really worked it out
[20:53:18] <tw2113> so...what we already have
[20:53:26] <tw2113> pull it up online, and print if we want to
[20:53:38] <snuggs> I'm really dumbing it down you know that
[20:53:58] <tw2113> and i'm asking what's different than what's already been crafted for 20 years
[20:54:51] <djQuery> Es0teric, hows this look do you understand it
[20:54:57] <snuggs> no using an alogortim to pull the most prominent information from the most resourceful sites (bookmarks of your choice per industry) and echoing that out on digital html5 mobile, desktop platform
[20:54:58] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/idatev/2/edit
[20:55:34] <tw2113> that part i could understand as being a new idea
[20:55:38] <snuggs> generating a Q&A from that information alone
[20:55:42] <djQuery> is there a better way to do this? var trows = number((t.length/4).toString().split('.')[0])
[20:55:42] <tw2113> the curation into 1 resource on demand
[20:56:14] <snuggs> tw2113: exactly
[20:57:03] <tw2113> if you can accomplish that tool, more power to you
[20:57:47] <snuggs> my question is to this small group here which seems our of 809 members minus the bots.  would people benefit from it and is it worth pursuing?
[20:57:59] <snuggs> opensource only
[20:58:21] <tw2113> a tiny sliver of the overall community
[20:58:40] <snuggs> a sliver is more than none
[20:58:46] <djQuery> snuggs, the jquery comunity is a lot larger than just the 809 peeps currently on
[20:58:56] <djQuery> not to mention the javascript comunity in general
[20:58:57] <tw2113> i wouldn't have much use for the tool myself
[20:58:57] <snuggs> djQuery: I know it is
[20:59:02] <snuggs> this was a starting base
[20:59:04] <tw2113> but i'm more akin to reading documentation
[20:59:32] <snuggs> documentation is a pre-requisite
[21:00:42] <relipse> someone bid on this project: https://www.elance.com/r/jobs/q-cworklog/
[21:00:53] <djQuery> stock overflow on steroids
[21:01:18] <Es0teric> djQuery lol
[21:01:27] <Es0teric> lots of mathematics
[21:01:45] <snuggs> djQuery: I would never approach them unless I got a general consensus here
[21:01:55] <snuggs> I'm all up in so
[21:02:03] <Es0teric> djQuery but is there a simpler way to do the calculation?
[21:02:17] <djQuery> I asked no one answered
[21:02:29] <Es0teric> because i thought you can just do .slice(0,4) and then .slice(4) on the remainders
[21:02:33] <djQuery> still it only has to be done once so ...
[21:03:02] <snuggs> ok goodnight everyone
[21:03:06] <djQuery> nopers .slice(4) would get you the same 1 2 3 4 every time
[21:03:17] <Es0teric> djQuery ah i see
[21:03:40] <Es0teric> also, djQuery  what does curpos stand for? cursor position?
[21:04:10] <djQuery> current position notice that I incriment it by 4 each time
[21:04:46] <djQuery> still need to add a test to see if remainder is greater than 4
[21:04:57] <djQuery> >0 rather and loop through those
[21:06:18] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/idatev/4/edit
[21:06:24] <djQuery> little edit
[21:08:05] <djQuery> my answer is never going to catch up with the accepted answer http://stackoverflow.com/questions/896777/remove-close-button-on-jqueryui-dialog/5301251#5301251
[21:08:34] <coldhead> stack overflow takes away your freedoms
[21:08:48] <djQuery> how so
[21:09:26] <coldhead> all this "peer review" and "this topic has been closed" and "karma"
[21:09:37] <coldhead> and how they own your answers
[21:09:58] <djQuery> only the last part do I have somewhat of an issue with
[21:10:03] <ChrisBolton> I'm trying to implement datatables.js to do a live-filter on a table via an input text box. I'm a little lost in the documentation. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
[21:10:05] <coldhead> thanks for the database of knowledge, kids, please pay $399 to access
[21:10:28] <djQuery> stackoverflow is free
[21:10:57] <coldhead> for now
[21:11:07] <coldhead> DUHN DUHN DUHNHHN
[21:12:18] <djQuery> anyone else having a problem with the lint on jsfiddle?
[21:13:33] <djQuery> hovering over the little red dots doesn't show the tooltip for me on chrome
[21:14:18] <djQuery> Es0teric, well I will leave the rest to you
[21:14:36] <djQuery> coldhead, you got a better way to do this? var trows = number((t.length/4).toString().split('.')[0])
[21:17:08] <linguini> I've recently updated jquery, and I now get some javascript errors and I don't understand selectors well.  Is this now bad syntax: $("a[rel]") ?
[21:17:43] <CD3L3MENTS> Hey im having an issue on this url http://2011.discreetsys.com/?page_id=14 - the jquery tabs in the main are off as you can see but the functionality is working great
[21:18:15] <CD3L3MENTS> check noconflict **
[21:22:46] <djQuery> CD3L3MENTS, dunno looks like something is causing them to float left
[21:26:08] <djQuery> CD3L3MENTS, don't see anywhere that .tabs is being called.
[21:27:19] <coldhead> css probably
[21:27:41] <djQuery> CD3L3MENTS, look at the html its that first img in the entry div thats causing it I think
[21:28:39] <djQuery> yeppers edited the css in chrome and it displays correctly
[21:30:02] <CD3L3MENTS> djQuery: the header banner type image
[21:30:21] <djQuery> you probably wanted it in the h2 above it or something
[21:30:42] <CD3L3MENTS> djQuery no what do you mean?
[21:30:58] <djQuery> CD3L3MENTS, open it in chrome
[21:31:21] <djQuery> right click on Contact and choose inspect element
[21:31:38] <djQuery> not that contact is in an H2
[21:31:55] <djQuery> look at the div under the h2
[21:32:08] <djQuery> expand it and notice that there is an image there
[21:32:18] <djQuery> move the image to the h2 as a test
[21:32:40] <djQuery> or just hide it using chrome real quick
[21:32:46] <CD3L3MENTS> djQuery you're right we kinda saw it pop up as the page was loading
[21:32:49] <djQuery> hey the tabs display correctly
[21:34:07] <coldhead> HEY PRESTO
[21:34:18] <djQuery> you got enough going on the page any what.
[21:34:47] <djQuery> get rid of the h2 and the image in my opinion
[21:35:05] <djQuery> oh and start with a theme that more closely matches the rest of the page
[21:35:11] <djQuery> vader?
[21:35:15] <djQuery> darkness
[21:36:10] <jaxxbo> looks like everybody is here
[21:36:36] <coldhead> any what indeed
[21:36:42] <jaxxbo> anybody knows this jquery validation very well?
[21:37:05] <djQuery> ?ask@jaxxbo
[21:37:06] <bot-t> jaxxbo, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[21:37:29] <CD3L3MENTS> Cool thankx
[21:37:51] <CD3L3MENTS> by the way your name is sick i make music
[21:38:38] <djQuery> it has nothing to do with music
[21:38:41] <jaxxbo> see here: http://screencast.com/t/MoebqpPazP
[21:38:48] <jaxxbo> the validation message is in english
[21:38:54] <jaxxbo> I want it to be in german
[21:39:04] <jaxxbo> what am I missing here?
[21:39:27] <djQuery> the language file
[21:39:34] <jaxxbo> i searched the whole page, for that text, went thru all files, but still cant find it
[21:39:46] <jaxxbo> the language file?
[21:40:19] <jaxxbo> so messages-de.js
[21:40:56] <djQuery> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5618499/jquery-validation-in-different-languages
[21:41:09] <coldhead> <3
[21:41:46] <djQuery> jaxxbo, see ?lmgtfy jquery validate german
[21:41:47] <bot-t> jaxxbo, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=
[21:41:55] <djQuery> silly bot
[21:42:17] <coldhead> ja, das ist unheimlich
[21:43:45] <ChrisBolton> Wow. Datatables.js is kind of amazing.
[21:46:21] <djQuery> wonder what ever happened to the ui.table
[21:49:39] <Es0teric> djQuery it says number() is not a function
[21:50:07] <Es0teric> well "number" is not defined
[21:50:09] <Es0teric> is what it really says
[21:50:14] <djQuery> then search on how to convert a string to a number
[21:52:05] <Es0teric> djQuery it was parseInt()
[21:53:28] <dblosevn_> Es0teric: if you pass undefined into parseInt it will fatal
[21:54:29] <dblosevn_> yourvar = (undefined === yourvar) ? 0 : parseInt(yourvar);
[21:58:58] <Palanivel> Hi To everyone
[21:59:35] <Palanivel> XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///C:/Users/Palanivel/Desktop/New%20folder/data/sampleJson.json. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[22:00:20] <djQuery> Palanivel, try running the page through an actual web server instead of by file: protocol
[22:00:23] <Palanivel> Please refere http://jsfiddle.net/wqYXH/
[22:00:39] <Es0teric> dblosevn_ it passes as 4
[22:00:41] <Es0teric> i mean
[22:00:42] <Es0teric> 2
[22:00:55] <Palanivel> here the json structure is  { "data":"success" }
[22:01:25] <djQuery> Palanivel, its not even attempting to hit the file at all once the browser detects the url
[22:01:30] <dblosevn_> Es0teric: i have no idea what your doing, i just noticed you said undefined and parseint close to each other so i offered a little advice
[22:01:38] <ryanneufeld> Palanivel: you can't use the file:// protocol when using ajax
[22:02:07] <Palanivel> @djQuery....There is no way to invoke the local file
[22:02:07] <b-ot> Palanivel: memorised “djQuery....There”.
[22:02:26] <ryanneufeld> bot-t: forget djQuery....There
[22:02:27] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, I don't remember "djQuery....There".
[22:02:30] <djQuery> sure you could write your own browser
[22:02:37] <ryanneufeld> bot-t: forget "djQuery....There"
[22:02:37] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, I don't remember ""djQuery....There"".
[22:03:04] <djQuery> nobody ever remembers me
[22:03:10] <dblosevn_> lol
[22:05:33] <Palanivel> @djQuery & @ryanneufeld....Thank you both
[22:05:43] <djQuery> np
[22:07:25] <Palanivel> And one more doubt...... i downloaded fullcal plugin in  that i wanna to create one function inside the plugin....Is it possible and if possible how to invoke or call the function
[22:08:44] <Palanivel> for example my plugin is ; (function($) { function sample() { } }(jQuery);
[22:09:26] <Palanivel> From here how to call the sample function which written inside the plugin
[22:09:37] <Palanivel> any idea???????
[22:09:45] <djQuery> depends
[22:10:17] <djQuery> a lot of plugins will allow you to override differrent evens by passing them an event handler at initialization time
[22:12:33] <Palanivel> @djQuery.....i understand what you trying to telling but if practical example will give more idea.....can you refere any link. Because, i am very new for jquery plugin....
[22:12:40] <hip2p> any idea why this code doesn't run? It works if placed inside a document.ready click event http://jsfiddle.net/kBcSr/1/
[22:13:01] <djQuery> Palanivel, yes check its examples view source and look at the code
[22:13:22] <djQuery> the 2nd example has a function that is passed to the click event
[22:14:38] <Palanivel> ya.......i have one button in UI...if the button click i wanna hit the function whcih i written inside the function
[22:15:01] <Palanivel> how to do that
[22:15:25] <Palanivel> i tried but it throughing error as function undefined
[22:15:28] <djQuery> ?demo@palanivel
[22:15:28] <bot-t> palanivel, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[22:15:33] <Palanivel> i not get
[22:15:42] <djQuery> its probably the scope of the function
[22:16:05] <djQuery> when you create a function inside of a function it can not be called outside of the parent function
[22:16:59] <djQuery> hip2p, what are you trying to append to the selected range?
[22:17:14] <djQuery> like the url tha the user is at or something
[22:17:17] <Palanivel> @djQuery.....Plugin contains lot of functions and i written one more function thats it
[22:17:44] <Palanivel> but i am call that function as outside of function only
[22:17:52] <hip2p> djQuery I'm trying to add a <bc></bc> to the highlighted text.
[22:17:54] <djQuery> Palanivel, without code I wouldnt know
[22:17:55] <b-ot> hip2p: No output.
[22:17:57] <Palanivel> i will try and get back to you
[22:18:04] <Palanivel> thank you
[22:18:37] <djQuery> whats a bc tag
[22:18:43] <djQuery> not familar with that one
[22:19:06] <djQuery> block code
[22:19:10] <hip2p> djQuery it's just something I made up to use in this situation. it works fine if I place the code inside a click function in the document ready
[22:19:34] <djQuery> are you just doing that to style it?
[22:19:37] <hip2p> yeah
[22:20:00] <djQuery> http://www.quirksmode.org/css/selection.html
[22:20:22] <djQuery> you mean you are using javascript to do something realy easy in css?
[22:20:33] <dblosevn_> lol nice
[22:20:48] <hip2p> djQuery well, what's going to happen is if when I hover over a different element, it's going to highlight that selection of text
[22:21:13] <hip2p> so I need some what to mark that bit of text so the other element knows what to highlight
[22:21:18] <hip2p> some way*
[22:21:28] <dblosevn_> how bout a class
[22:21:32] <dblosevn_> toggle it
[22:21:35] <hip2p> right, so that's what I was doing
[22:21:44] <hip2p> in my code I was adding a class to the <bc>
[22:22:08] <djQuery> whats the current FF version?
[22:22:12] <djQuery> 3.6?
[22:22:17] <hip2p> I'm using chrome
[22:22:19] <dblosevn_> last year maybe
[22:22:29] <ryanneufeld> djQuery: 18, your FF is old
[22:22:30] <dblosevn_> its up to 20 somthing now i think
[22:22:32] <ryanneufeld> like SO old
[22:22:39] <hip2p> I could just wrap the text in a div
[22:23:08] <dblosevn_> i thought browsers were trained to strip tags they didnt understand?
[22:23:33] <hip2p> dblosevn_ not sure, but it was working fine in chrome with bc. Anyway, I just changed it to div, and it still doesn't work
[22:23:34] <djQuery> or just mangle them
[22:23:54] <dblosevn_> ?demo @hip2p
[22:23:55] <bot-t> hip2p, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[22:24:05] <hip2p> one sec
[22:24:08] <dblosevn_> ill check it out when you show me the issue
[22:24:33] <djQuery> gonna have compatability issues with <ie9
[22:24:38] <djQuery> but screw them
[22:25:09] <dblosevn_> anybody know a quick and dirty to find delete and remove all video directorys from an svn repo?
[22:25:48] <djQuery> hip2p, well theres one big issue the way that I see it
[22:25:49] <dblosevn_> there all empty I moved them elsewhere but forgot to remove them from the repo so now i got a ton of empty dirs all over the place
[22:25:52] <ryanneufeld> dblosevn_: you can use find, and -exec
[22:26:13] <ryanneufeld> ?g find empty directories
[22:26:16] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, How to Find and Delete Empty Directories and Files in Unix - http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/03/find-empty-directories-and-files/
[22:26:32] <dblosevn_> well they wouldnt be empty lol theres .svn directorys in them
[22:26:38] <ryanneufeld> dblosevn_: just make sure your command is svn rm
[22:26:42] <ryanneufeld> not rm
[22:26:56] <dblosevn_> ya been there before broke the hell outta my repo
[22:27:04] <djQuery> you could possibly wind up witht he following html   <li>something <bc> lkadfs;lkdfkj;l</li><li>something else</li></ul><div> completly differ</bc>ent</div>
[22:27:06] <b-ot> djQuery: No output.
[22:27:09] <dblosevn_> blah blah blah is not a working copy...
[22:27:35] <ryanneufeld> dblosevn_: svn revert --depth=infinity && svn up usually fixes that
[22:28:06] <dblosevn_> ya thats fine if you havent just added 20gb of data to the repo that your in the process of commiting
[22:28:22] <rmb> hye, how do I apply this http://pastebin.com/M1LpgR4Y to http://jvectormap.com/examples/markers-world/ marker on its appear?
[22:28:54] <dblosevn_> i had to export revert and copy everything back from the export
[22:29:10] <dblosevn_> and still managed to lose data
[22:30:10] <dblosevn_> got it all worked out though, im not really using svn for version control as much as for sync
[22:33:41] <feathersanddown> how to get html element from a $('#id_element') ?
[22:33:52] <ryanneufeld> feathersanddown: see ?html
[22:33:55] <bot-t> feathersanddown, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[22:34:01] <ryanneufeld> feathersanddown: see ?get
[22:34:02] <bot-t> feathersanddown, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[22:34:32] <feathersanddown> that's for inner html content
[22:34:41] <feathersanddown> I need an input
[22:34:58] <feathersanddown> <input id="id_element" />  <--- whole this
[22:34:58] <ryanneufeld> That's not what you asked for though
[22:35:05] <ryanneufeld> feathersanddown: see ?get
[22:35:06] <bot-t> feathersanddown, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[22:35:07] <feathersanddown> sorry my english is very poor
[22:35:17] <ryanneufeld> you want the DOM element
[22:38:25] <Cork> feathersanddown: $('<div/>').html($('#id_element'.clone()).html() is how you get the entire html string
[22:38:48] <ryanneufeld> Cork: wat
[22:38:58] <Cork> ryanneufeld: yup
[22:39:03] <Cork> opps
[22:39:11] <Cork> feathersanddown: $('<div/>').html($('#id_element').clone()).html() is how you get the entire html string
[22:39:23] <ryanneufeld> Cork: no
[22:39:25] <ryanneufeld> just... no
[22:39:38] <Cork> ryanneufeld: yes, thats the only way to get the outerhtml string
[22:40:04] <Cork> ryanneufeld: there are situations when you need the html and not the dom
[22:40:14] <Cork> and thats how you get it
[22:40:22] <feathersanddown> clone........ uhm.......
[22:40:23] <hip2p> ok here's my jfiddle. when you highlight text on the first line, it becomes red. When you right click the first line, then highlight text, and then click "click me!", the first line does not get highlighted. http://jsfiddle.net/kBcSr/2/
[22:40:26] <feathersanddown> get return an array
[22:40:29] <dblosevn_> .get(0).outerHTML ?
[22:40:36] <Cork> feathersanddown: and the extra div wrapper
[22:40:41] <ryanneufeld> no
[22:40:42] <Cork> dblosevn_: not cross browser
[22:40:46] <ryanneufeld> just don't do that
[22:41:10] <ryanneufeld> feathersanddown: why do you need the string?
[22:41:38] <hip2p> since the "click me!" line gets shifted after clicking, that must mean that my 'bc' code has different parents in the document.ready and the document.on sections?
[22:41:41] <feathersanddown> really..... why?
[22:42:12] <Cork> feathersanddown: cause there isn't a command to get the outerHTML cross browsers
[22:42:41] <Cork> feathersanddown: so you need to clone the element ad it to a new element and get IT'S innerHTML string
[22:42:59] <Cork> feathersanddown: but ya, you should only do this if you really need the string
[22:43:20] <feathersanddown> $('#id_element').change( function( ) { foo( this ); } ) ;   <---- "this" is a parameter
[22:43:28] <feathersanddown> and foo a function
[22:43:36] <Cork> why do you need the string there?
[22:43:40] <ryanneufeld> feathersanddown: what is it you're trying to do?
[22:44:19] <ryanneufeld> feathersanddown: in your code, foo will get a reference to the #id_element dom object
[22:44:21] <feathersanddown> foo is function foo( a ) { if( a.value == 0 ) 'ok' else 'error' }
[22:44:22] <Cork> and you could just as well rewrite $('#id_element').change( function( ) { foo( this ); } ) ; as $('#id_element').change(foo);
[22:44:38] <Cork> feathersanddown: then you don't want the string...
[22:44:53] <Cork> .value isn't member of strings
[22:45:04] <Cork> its for html input elements
[22:45:16] <feathersanddown> no, it is dom element, this work for me
[22:45:24] <Cork> exactly
[22:45:28] <feathersanddown> may I need to pass $(this) ?
[22:45:38] <Cork> so why do you need the html of the input element?
[22:45:48] <Cork> you just said you want the dom...
[22:45:48] <feathersanddown> no I don't need html
[22:45:52] <Cork> ...
[22:45:56] <Cork> O_o''
[22:45:58] <feathersanddown> xD
[22:46:04] <feathersanddown> 3:52AM
[22:46:05] <dblosevn_> i need popcorn
[22:46:13] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @feathersanddown
[22:46:13] <bot-t> feathersanddown, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[22:46:42] <dblosevn_> seriously svn mv requires uploading the files again
[22:47:02] <Cork> dblosevn_: seriously; sucks and should have died years ago
[22:47:08] <Cork> *svn sucks
[22:47:34] <dblosevn_> ya, i considered changing to git as part of this rewrite
[22:47:53] <Cork> i'm ok with both mercurial and git
[22:47:57] <Cork> but ya, git is better
[22:48:13] <dblosevn_> oh i was wrong it just hung a minute it didnt reupload
[22:48:28] <Cork> my statement still stands :D
[22:48:40] <dblosevn_> mine too lol
[22:48:55] <ryanneufeld> svn blows
[22:49:12] <dblosevn_> i just dont like the lack of web interface with git, i need to be able to download files without a git client
[22:49:13] <binaryfus10nz> sup gents, whats the latest?
[22:49:19] <binaryfus10nz> 1.9 messing up sites :?
[22:49:19] <dblosevn_> so i opted to stick with svn
[22:50:08] <Cork> dblosevn_: well there isn't a built in webinterface for git
[22:50:20] <Cork> but there are webinterfaces around that let you handle the repo
[22:50:29] <dblosevn_> ya, i use beanstalk
[22:50:45] <binaryfus10nz> I hear good things about it, have you tried other ones?
[22:50:54] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: if you use old deprecated functions yes
[22:50:55] <dblosevn_> it support git but i dont think i can script a file download directly without a git client
[22:51:07] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: try loading the jquery-migration lib
[22:51:20] <binaryfus10nz> sounds interesting Cork
[22:51:30] <binaryfus10nz> my prob is I have like 100 web demos that linke to /1/
[22:51:40] <Cork> dblosevn_: you would have to have something that talks to git, as git(and mercurial) doens't actually have files
[22:51:55] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: so link to 1.8
[22:52:05] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: and then fix them one at a time
[22:52:26] <Cork> 1.9 is a big "spring cleaning" as they call it :)
[22:52:32] <Cork> 2.0 is even bigger >_>
[22:52:34] <dblosevn_> eg when the ipad app requests a file, i need to be able to give it a url to download it and we dont want to pay for the bandwidth
[22:53:07] <dblosevn_> we pass the bandwidth bill off to beanstalk lol
[22:53:14] <Cork> dblosevn_: so just keep a checked out repo and point a web service to it
[22:53:27] <Cork> and then in an post commit caller to git pull on the repo
[22:53:51] <Cork> git has loads of nice hooks
[22:54:28] <dblosevn_> i got precommit and post commit with svn, cant think of anything else id need
[22:54:48] <dblosevn_> i just dont like how easy it is to break your repo
[22:54:50] <Cork> i meant there is way to solve it for git too
[22:54:55] <dblosevn_> ive never successfully broken a git repo
[22:55:23] <Cork> not unreversibly break no
[22:55:28] <dblosevn_> cant count how many times ive screwed up an svn repo though
[22:55:40] <Cork> i've breaked git several times, but its always been quite easy to fix
[22:56:20] <Cork> nowdays i mainly use git svn for svn repos :)
[22:56:30] <Cork> that makes them a lot more stable for me at least
[22:56:32] <dblosevn_> i may move to git if i get it approved to host the files on a cdn
[22:56:55] <Cork> dblosevn_: like i said you could still host them locally if you like
[22:57:04] <dblosevn_> they are hosted locally
[22:57:06] <Cork> you would just have to hold a checked out git repo
[22:57:11] <Cork> ah
[22:57:23] <dblosevn_> but we pay out the ass for bandwidth so i upload them to a 3rd party providor and let them pay for it
[22:58:02] <dblosevn_> once device being synced is about 20gb of data
[22:58:13] <dblosevn_> after this rewrite it will be closer to 30gb
[22:58:30] <dblosevn_> theres approx 150 devices and about 300 more to come
[22:58:48] <Cork> we sit on a 100gb flat line :)
[22:58:48] <feathersanddown> solved
[22:58:51] <feathersanddown> thanks for your time
[22:58:54] <feathersanddown> have to go sleep
[22:58:54] <Cork> so we don't really care ^^
[22:58:55] <feathersanddown> =)
[22:59:02] <Cork> feathersanddown: sleep tight
[22:59:16] <dblosevn_> im pushing for cdn though maybe they will agree
[22:59:37] <dblosevn_> downloading 20gb on a public internet connection in brazil is not fun
[23:00:21] <Cork> ya, i know brazil is one of the sad points
[23:00:25] <dblosevn_> was downloading at 20KB/s
[23:00:43] <dblosevn_> took 9 days to get the machines prepped for the event
[23:01:00] <Cork> poland is another one
[23:01:06] <feathersanddown> thank you!!!!!
[23:01:07] <feathersanddown> :)
[23:01:09] <dblosevn_> france sucked too
[23:01:26] <dblosevn_> especially with the svn repo being hosted out of chicago
[23:01:29] <Cork> here you normally have a monthly fee and thats that ^^
[23:01:43] <dblosevn_> its hosted on a cloud server
[23:01:53] <dblosevn_> you pay for everything
[23:02:05] <Cork> wait you pull svn from chicago to brazil??
[23:02:08] <dblosevn_> by the hour plus storage plus bandwidth
[23:02:14] <dblosevn_> ya
[23:02:24] <Cork> not exactly next door hosting is it? >_>
[23:02:32] <dblosevn_> thats why im pushing for cdn hosting
[23:02:36] * Cork nods
[23:03:04] <dblosevn_> thattl be pretty expensive too though
[23:03:20] <dblosevn_> when im done ill have about 35-40gb in the repo
[23:03:42] <dblosevn_> with each device consuming about 20-25gb on the initial sync
[23:04:24] <Cork> the downside with git is the client would use even more data
[23:04:33] <Cork> as git actually clones the repo sitory
[23:04:35] <Cork> *history
[23:04:57] <Cork> while svn just grabs the specific revision
[23:05:40] <dblosevn_> svn seems to have a lot of overhead though
[23:05:52] <Cork> its nothing if you compare it to git
[23:06:03] <Cork> though git compresses the data better
[23:06:16] <dblosevn_> our current reepo is about 14gb and it generally transfers about 19gb on a full checkout
[23:06:20] <Cork> as you have change layers instead of files
[23:06:33] <Cork> O_o
[23:06:42] <Cork> that makes no sense
[23:06:51] <Cork> unless you rarely modify old files
[23:06:55] <dblosevn_> the .svn dirs are huge
[23:07:28] <dblosevn_> most of the files never change
[23:07:34] <dblosevn_> only new ones are added
[23:07:39] <Cork> that would explain it
[23:07:50] <binaryfus10nz> why is your guys stuff so big
[23:07:51] <binaryfus10nz> 19gb ?
[23:08:03] <Cork> lots of binary data i suspect
[23:08:04] <dblosevn_> videos, images, pdfs
[23:08:08] <Cork> :)
[23:08:09] <binaryfus10nz> video I guess
[23:08:24] <dblosevn_> the pdfs are bigger
[23:08:25] <binaryfus10nz> still has to be a large site but  I guess client CMS driven they can upload HUGe files
[23:08:41] <dblosevn_> i got about 4gb in video
[23:08:47] <binaryfus10nz> so if we do more informative type WP sites, any suggestions on SVN vs GIT vs ?
[23:09:21] <dblosevn_> pdfs are hd quality, some over 200 pages
[23:09:27] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: if you have lots of binary data and rarely modify files svn is the correct choice
[23:09:38] <Cork> its one of the few situation when svn still wins
[23:10:22] <dblosevn_> and they are stored not only as pdfs but also as extracted images as the ipad uses the pdf while the web version uses the images
[23:11:36] <dblosevn_> the new system wont require the web clients to download the ipad assets though so it should trim it down a lot
[23:11:50] <binaryfus10nz> well WP sites query the database, but they do have a variety of cache option/plugins
[23:11:59] <binaryfus10nz> but I would say the server files once in production dont change often
[23:12:27] <binaryfus10nz> seems like would still come very in handy when multiple devs work on a site?
[23:13:02] <dblosevn_> or when your site gets hacked which it will
[23:13:13] <binaryfus10nz> will it?
[23:13:21] <binaryfus10nz> why u say so?
[23:13:21] <dblosevn_> eventually
[23:13:42] <dblosevn_> between wordpress and joomla ive cleaned more viruses
[23:13:47] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: to have a repo behind a site is really nice, it makes it much easier to push updates
[23:13:47] <dblosevn_> then i can count
[23:13:58] <Cork> and restoring it if it crashes for some reason
[23:14:25] <binaryfus10nz> do they manage DB's ?
[23:14:26] <Cork> being able to rollback a release by simpy checking out an older revision is...
[23:14:39] <Cork> repos don't handle databases at all
[23:14:43] <dblosevn_> i like beanstalk for that, can develop on one server and when your ready push a deployment to production
[23:14:47] <Cork> unless you dump them to .sql files
[23:14:51] <dblosevn_> mine do :-)
[23:15:14] <dblosevn_> my precommit scripts dumps the db
[23:15:24] <binaryfus10nz> how often does it run
[23:15:28] <Cork> exactly what i said then :)
[23:15:32] <dblosevn_> on every commit
[23:15:53] <GoSox> trying to make a chart with Highchart.js . . . this is terrible documentation
[23:15:59] <binaryfus10nz> what if ur DB is dynamic
[23:16:09] <binaryfus10nz> like ecomm
[23:16:15] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: then you should have a backup system instead
[23:16:23] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: you can't really have revisions of a database
[23:16:32] <dblosevn_> in this project in order to make changes you have to commit, you work in the admin panel and when you are ready you click the sync button and it moves your changes to production
[23:16:53] <binaryfus10nz> is it hard to setup on windows?
[23:16:56] <dblosevn_> doesnt really work so well for a blog though
[23:17:10] <dblosevn_> well a multi user blog
[23:17:12] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: depends on what database server you use
[23:17:34] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: in windows you would have to have a backup software that uses shadowcopy
[23:17:37] <binaryfus10nz> I mean to manage/dev from my pc server/hosting is linux
[23:17:51] <Cork> na
[23:17:59] <Cork> all you need is an ssh client :)
[23:18:10] <Cork> like putty
[23:18:18] <dblosevn_> im thinking he probally has a shared host good luck with ssh
[23:18:26] <Cork> ah
[23:18:33] <binaryfus10nz> ya
[23:18:34] <Cork> then managing matters even less
[23:18:40] <binaryfus10nz> u have limited but u can request per domain/user
[23:18:45] <binaryfus10nz> but im moving to singlehop.com soon
[23:18:47] <Cork> most shared hosting is just ftp
[23:18:47] <dblosevn_> ya cause theres not much at all you can do lol
[23:19:04] <dblosevn_> think im still a reseller with them
[23:19:09] <Cork> and you would have to grab a mysql client for windows for the database
[23:19:12] <Cork> but that should be it
[23:19:31] <dblosevn_> sqlyog enterprise is pretty awesome about that
[23:19:39] <dblosevn_> ittl make scheduled backups
[23:19:50] <dblosevn_> not to mention the gui is beyond awesome
[23:19:52] <binaryfus10nz> what do you guys develop sites on?
[23:19:56] <binaryfus10nz> PHP ?
[23:20:07] <dblosevn_> notepad++ ssh and filezilla sftp
[23:20:16] <dblosevn_> oh ya and dont forget chrome
[23:20:17] <binaryfus10nz> but what type of files
[23:20:19] <binaryfus10nz> lol
[23:20:26] <GoSox> text files!
[23:20:28] <binaryfus10nz> .php ?
[23:20:29] <GoSox> w00t
[23:20:48] <GoSox> yes i use php for my server side stuff
[23:20:59] <dblosevn_> php/javascript/jquery/java/objective c/asp.net /whatever my client dreams up for me to need to write
[23:21:12] <binaryfus10nz> lol
[23:21:15] <binaryfus10nz> how about what do you prefer
[23:21:24] <dblosevn_> depends on the task
[23:21:26] <binaryfus10nz> pure PHP? Codeigniter? WordPress ? Other CMS ?
[23:21:34] <dblosevn_> no frameworks thank you
[23:21:36] <binaryfus10nz> for informative based sites with CMS
[23:21:37] <dblosevn_> CI blows
[23:21:47] <binaryfus10nz> pure PHP is better?
[23:21:50] <binaryfus10nz> ROR ?
[23:21:54] <Cork> ya, pure php or pure go is nice
[23:22:03] <binaryfus10nz> go?
[23:22:04] <Cork> ror sucks if you want it small and stable
[23:22:06] <GoSox> binaryfus10nz: why not ease up on the buzz words and ask a real question
[23:22:09] <dblosevn_> i have my own mini framework i built a while ago
[23:22:13] <Cork> ?g golang @ binaryfus10nz
[23:22:15] <bot-t> binaryfus10nz, The Go Programming Language - http://golang.org/
[23:22:32] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: you build the server in the site :)
[23:22:38] <binaryfus10nz> well we just dev a bunch of WP sites, it seems to work ok but I feel like their is a next generation coming
[23:22:43] <binaryfus10nz> responsive is big but thats just CSS really

[23:32:36] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: btw, talking about ror, they have had a huge list of cve releases lately (that latest tonight)
[23:33:23] <Cork> s/that latest/the latest/
[23:37:15] <binaryfus10nz> CVE?
[23:37:53] <binaryfus10nz> this GO isnt for me
[23:38:03] <binaryfus10nz> I think I need to move more towards logic, and hire elite dev(s)
[23:38:24] <binaryfus10nz> too many various syntax's to learn, I do <3 WP tho
[23:42:49] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: Common Vulnerability Exposures
[23:43:00] <binaryfus10nz> huh
[23:43:20] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: they have had big security holes in other words :)
[23:43:28] <binaryfus10nz> GO ?
[23:43:33] <Cork> RoR
[23:43:41] <binaryfus10nz> really? I thought its compiled
[23:43:46] <binaryfus10nz> they hack login/db acces or ?
[23:43:49] <Cork> RoR??
[23:43:59] <Cork> ror is ruby, its not compiled
[23:44:06] <binaryfus10nz> compiled yea hmm
[23:44:47] <tw2113> i wouldn't mind learning ruby
[23:44:49] <binaryfus10nz> what about JS technologies or ways to push processing to client side as ajax/js vs DB queries on server
[23:45:06] <Cork> http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-0155
[23:45:07] <Cork> https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rubyonrails-security/1h2DR63ViGo
[23:45:12] <Cork> just to take the last two
[23:45:27] <Cork> tw2113: as long as you know english its not hard :D
[23:45:44] <Cork> ruby is ridiculously simple to learn
[23:45:53] <tw2113> so I've seen thus far
[23:45:56] <tw2113> i have a couple links on it
[23:45:57] <binaryfus10nz> ya i've gone through tuts at code zombies
[23:46:16] <Cork> i love some parts of it; and H-A-T-E other
[23:46:19] <tw2113> i'm still mostly php thanks to WP
[23:46:38] <Cork> ya, RoR is hard to use if you want shared hosting
[23:46:51] <tw2113> screw the rails :)
[23:47:02] <Cork> well ruby is same
[23:47:25] <binaryfus10nz> Cork, I like this site... funny I was an MIS security major, but deal with public informative sites so this stuff isnt much of an issue
[23:47:26] <Cork> ruby for the web as a hole is hard for shared hosting
[23:48:14] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: well since november RoR have had 4 major remote execution and remote sql injection holes
[23:48:29] <Cork> and theres been some big sites affected by it
[23:49:01] <Cork> like the id system for one european country (don't remeber witch)
[23:49:02] <binaryfus10nz> so they have had them but the vulnerability became known?
[23:49:16] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: they where found in that span
[23:49:21] <Cork> fixed a few days later
[23:49:34] <Cork> and ya its been 0-day exploits
[23:49:43] <binaryfus10nz> 0-day = ?
[23:50:20] <Cork> security holes found live without a known fix
[23:58:35] <jdo_dk> can someone explain me the right way of coding a jquerymobile page. Do i load all js in pageinit? And how do i prevent events for firing twice or more? if i make use of pageinit and change, the change will fire twice, when page1 is loaded, another page is loaded and page1 is loaded again. How to prevent behaviour like this?
