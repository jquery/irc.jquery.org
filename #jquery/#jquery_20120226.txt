[00:03:20] <LukeNukem> hello, on click of a element i toggle another element
[00:03:36] <LukeNukem> so when the element is clicked first, it will show the hidden element, when clicked oncemore it will hide the unhidden element
[00:03:49] <LukeNukem> but instead on second click it is just showing the unhidden element again
[00:05:26] <y3di> if i call $(this).children on any element that has only one child, will it return an array of length 1 consisting of the element, or would it just return the element
[00:06:56] <wookiehangover> it will return a collection with 1 item
[00:09:19] <LukeNukem> someone answer my question please
[00:12:28] <coldhead> what is your question LukeNukem?
[00:12:41] <coldhead> something to do with clicking and hiding?
[00:12:44] <Es0teric> this
[00:12:45] <Es0teric> is
[00:12:48] <Es0teric> some fuckin bullshit
[00:13:11] <coldhead> don't panic Es0teric, it's going to be okay
[00:13:23] <Es0teric> im not panickingâ€¦ i am getting frustrated
[00:13:28] <jrockjiggz> fuck people
[00:13:55] <Es0teric> this shit manâ€¦ when i use the .each() method, it triggers all the fuckin elements
[00:13:58] <jrockjiggz> fuck people who don't ask straight up what their deal is
[00:14:26] <coldhead> Es0teric: that probably means you aren't using $(this) ?
[00:14:45] <jrockjiggz> $('#myshit').die('click').on('click'), function(){ //do my shit });
[00:15:14] <Es0teric> coldhead, noâ€¦ because i am not trying to use $(this)â€¦ the elements i want to trigger arent any children of $(this)
[00:15:28] <LukeNukem> coldhead, http://pastebin.com/3BcjDWXq
[00:15:49] <coldhead> Es0teric: but they might be $(this).siblings() ? or $(this).cousins() ?
[00:15:50] <LukeNukem> obviously one first click of notif icon, it shows show notifications_bar and on second click it should hide
[00:15:53] <LukeNukem> but it keeps showing
[00:15:54] <LukeNukem> and does not hide
[00:19:24] <tw2113> you ok over there jrockjiggz ?
[00:19:26] <y3di> var $ticket = $(this).children()[0]; -- i error out when i do $ticket.attr('class') -- htmlspanelement has no method attr
[00:19:30] <coldhead> LukeNukem: http://jsfiddle.net/jjA2g/
[00:20:01] <coldhead> i think you are using toggle() wrong
[00:20:05] <coldhead> fadeToggle() works
[00:20:49] <Es0teric> coldhead, theres a .cousins()?
[00:21:04] <tw2113> ?cousins
[00:21:04] <LukeNukem> nope, it does not work either
[00:21:05] <bot-t> tw2113, .pushStack() - Add a collection of DOM elements onto the jQuery stack. http://api.jquery.com/pushStack/
[00:21:13] <LukeNukem> instead of hiding, it shows shows it again
[00:21:17] <tw2113> nope, that wasn't necessarily right of me
[00:21:22] <coldhead> Es0teric: there's a plugin for it
[00:21:30] <tw2113> ah
[00:21:37] <coldhead> it's a somewhat of a joke
[00:21:50] <Es0teric> coldhead, i know the <p> tag i am looking for is in a <li> after the class i specify
[00:22:45] <LukeNukem> aaah coldhead it does not work T_T
[00:29:16] <y3di> anyone kno y i might be getting that error?
[00:29:53] <coldhead> WHAT ERROR
[00:30:38] <y3di> var $ticket = $(this).children()[0]; -- i error out when i do $ticket.attr('class') -- htmlspanelement has no method attr
[00:33:57] <coldhead> y3di: try $($ticket).attr('class')
[00:34:46] <LukeNukem> coldhead, cmon man T_T
[00:35:16] <y3di> hm, why is that necessary, i thought children() returned a jquery object?
[00:35:24] <Ukto> i am using jquery tabs, and have about 3 on the left hand side... is there a way to set the 3rd to basically float right?
[00:35:25] <y3di> collection of jq objecys*
[00:36:20] <coldhead> LukeNukem: i gave you code that works, i don't know why your code doesn't!
[00:36:31] <coldhead> make your code more like my code and maybe it will work?
[00:36:36] <coldhead> that is what i would try to do
[00:37:10] <coldhead> y3di: when you use [0] you access the actual DOM elem, without the jQuery magic
[00:37:16] <MasterP> coldhead:  lol cocky yet nice I like it
[00:37:42] <coldhead> $('something') is jQUery, $('something')[0] is DOM element
[00:38:07] <coldhead> $('something').children()[0] is not jQuery :(
[00:38:30] <y3di> coldhead: oh, what would be the alternative for getting the jqeury object at position 0? (the collection only has one element)
[00:39:59] <coldhead> ?eq
[00:40:00] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[00:40:15] <y3di> coldhead: thanks alot
[00:40:56] <Es0teric> the freaking thing thats killing me with this isâ€¦ when i hover over the classs - it changes it onceâ€¦ thats cool but when i hover over again, it removes the original element completely and returns undefined even WITH a global var attached to it
[00:42:40] <coldhead> i am sorry, Es0teric
[00:42:58] <Es0teric> and that only happens when i use .html() if i use .append(), it keeps the original element and appends the value i specify after
[00:43:08] <coldhead> global vars can be very buggy, i would try to rewrite it without that
[00:43:31] <Es0teric> coldhead, then how do i pass the values i need from mousein/out
[00:43:32] <Es0teric> ?
[00:44:04] <coldhead> with data() ? or with local variables like i did before
[00:44:08] <coldhead> in a "closure"
[00:44:54] <Es0teric> coldhead, i tried data() it doesnt work like that
[00:45:01] <y3di> is it possible to animate class changes? like .removeClass().addClass('someclass')
[00:45:20] <coldhead> ?g jquery animateclass
[00:45:21] <bot-t> coldhead, animateClass-Features - jQuery Forum - http://forum.jquery.com/topic/animateclass-features
[00:45:41] <coldhead> there are plugins, y3di, and i thing jQUery UI might do it
[00:46:14] <y3di> coldhead: interesting thanks
[00:46:34] <Es0teric> coldhead, once i do evnt.html(), the .data() becomes useless...
[00:53:15] <eyen_ekpo> wetin be the latest on jQuery mobile?
[00:56:18] <yamahaalex37> damn
[00:56:22] <yamahaalex37> ealier i thought i had it
[00:56:29] <yamahaalex37> i m adding style sheets to a header
[00:56:36] <yamahaalex37> but i need to figure out how to remove one thats already been added
[00:56:37] <yamahaalex37> thru php
[00:56:57] <Es0teric> you can setup a $_GET, yamahaalex37
[00:57:15] <yamahaalex37> in php?
[00:57:23] <Es0teric> yes
[00:57:43] <yamahaalex37> im not sure how i would do that
[00:57:47] <yamahaalex37> or im not sure what you mean
[00:58:03] <Es0teric> yamahaalex37, you can do a simple if() statement in php to grab the $_GET that would detect if the one has been added already
[00:58:20] <coldhead> Es0teric: clone(true) preserves data
[00:58:29] <Es0teric> coldhead, its not preserving this data
[00:58:31] <coldhead> that's why i used it in my example NINE OR TEN HOURES AGO
[00:58:40] <coldhead> ?clone
[00:58:40] <bot-t> .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[00:58:42] <yamahaalex37> if what?
[00:58:45] <yamahaalex37> lol sorry
[00:58:48] <coldhead> WITHDATAANDEVENTS
[00:58:50] <yamahaalex37> $document->addStyleSheet($this->baseurl.'/templates/'.$this->template.'/css/'.$color.'.css');
[00:59:03] <yamahaalex37> ignore the $this/ crap
[00:59:03] <Es0teric> yamahaalex37: you're using a framework arent you?
[00:59:08] <yamahaalex37> yes :/
[00:59:13] <Es0teric> codeigniter right?
[00:59:19] <yamahaalex37> no, even better
[00:59:23] <yamahaalex37> Joomla
[00:59:31] <Es0teric> Joomlaâ€¦ isnt a framework
[00:59:33] <Es0teric> its a CMS
[00:59:36] <yamahaalex37> well
[00:59:50] <yamahaalex37> tahts still a framework
[00:59:53] <Es0teric> no
[01:00:00] <Es0teric> codeigniter is a framework
[01:00:03] <yamahaalex37> if you compare a fresh yii to fresh joomla install
[01:00:12] <yamahaalex37> they offer you damn near same features
[01:00:29] <Es0teric> framework inthe sense that it does offer MVC
[01:00:38] <yamahaalex37> yes
[01:00:46] <yamahaalex37> its just a framework with a bunch of components attatched
[01:00:51] <MasterP> Es0teric:  codeigniter <3
[01:00:55] <yamahaalex37> ew
[01:01:01] <yamahaalex37> i think i would rather use kohana
[01:01:02] <coldhead> if you guys keep talking about php i am going to be sick
[01:01:09] <Es0teric> lmao coldhead
[01:01:16] <Es0teric> js is so difficult for me right now
[01:01:18] <yamahaalex37> yeah i would rather use backbone.js at this point
[01:01:25] <Es0teric> i am thinking of opting out for raw js to get this shit done
[01:01:48] <coldhead> may god help you Es0teric
[01:02:19] <Es0teric> coldhead, i can actually do this shit in raw js easier
[01:02:22] <Es0teric> than i can in jquery
[01:02:48] <yamahaalex37> should this work
[01:02:48] <Es0teric> jquery is doing too much extra shit
[01:02:49] <yamahaalex37> var currentStyle = $('head').append('<link rel="stylesheet" href="url.css" type="text/css" />');
[01:03:09] <Es0teric> yamahaalex37, how about youâ€¦ test it out?
[01:03:18] <yamahaalex37> it doesnt work
[01:03:24] <yamahaalex37> so im wondering if it should
[01:03:45] <Es0teric> so then
[01:03:55] <yamahaalex37> nvm
[01:03:56] <yamahaalex37> it worked
[01:04:10] <coldhead> great work everyone, take five
[01:04:23] <yamahaalex37> sorry guys, something came up
[01:04:26] <yamahaalex37> need you back here in 30
[01:04:27] <yamahaalex37> seconds
[01:04:40] <Es0teric> lmao coldhead
[01:05:05] <yamahaalex37> ok were good to continue
[01:05:15] <yamahaalex37> so im successfully adding my new styles on change
[01:05:25] <yamahaalex37> just need to remove what is now var currentStyle
[01:05:34] <yamahaalex37> var currentStyle = jQuery('head').append(
[01:06:07] <coldhead> currentStyle.remove()
[01:06:10] <yamahaalex37> they should make a remove funciton
[01:06:11] <yamahaalex37> nice
[01:06:23] <coldhead> ?remove
[01:06:24] <bot-t> .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[01:08:08] <yamahaalex37> wow
[01:08:11] <yamahaalex37> its doing something crazy
[01:08:15] <yamahaalex37> its removing like... all my stylse
[01:08:29] <Es0teric> yamahaalex37, what my hover is doing now is something crazy
[01:08:32] <yamahaalex37> wait
[01:08:43] <yamahaalex37> its removing my <head> is what its doing
[01:08:51] <yamahaalex37> help! my head came off
[01:09:06] <yamahaalex37> never used it much anyway
[01:09:22] <Es0teric> its removing your <head>
[01:09:26] <Es0teric> because you targeted it
[01:09:28] <killer11> yamahaalex37: please stop and think before typing....
[01:09:32] <Es0teric> logically speaking
[01:09:51] <killer11> its all logically doing what you are asking it to do.
[01:09:51] <yamahaalex37> i thought I was making var = to jquery head.appent(blahblah)
[01:09:53] <yamahaalex37> therefore the entire thing
[01:10:15] <coldhead> var currentStyle = $('<link rel="stylesheet" href="url.css" type="text/css" />').appendTo('head');
[01:10:19] <killer11> try giving it an ID and then select the id
[01:10:43] <yamahaalex37> hmm
[01:10:46] <coldhead> ?appendto
[01:10:47] <bot-t> .appendTo(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target. http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[01:11:12] <yamahaalex37> which one should i try
[01:11:20] <killer11> both.
[01:11:23] <yamahaalex37> how do you give something like that an ID
[01:11:36] <yamahaalex37> var = $('#<link
[01:11:36] <Joe_S> do either .wrap() or .addClass() have callback?
[01:12:13] <yamahaalex37> js is the kind of compound functions
[01:12:17] <yamahaalex37> king*
[01:14:27] <yamahaalex37> coldhead, your function worked perfect
[01:14:29] <coldhead> they have no use for a callback, Joe_S, they are not asynchronous
[01:14:43] <yamahaalex37> thanks Es0teric coldhead and killer
[01:14:51] <coldhead> have fun yamahaalex37
[01:15:10] <yamahaalex37> could js ever be as powerful as c++
[01:15:16] <yamahaalex37> for things like games in browsers
[01:15:26] <yamahaalex37> ive seen WebGL and TF2 in browser for example
[01:15:35] <Joe_S> I just found that .wrap does, I only need so that once I have wrapped some <a> tags I can re load the lightbox script
[01:15:53] <sam113101> depends on the engine
[01:15:57] <sam113101> v8 is nice
[01:16:11] <yamahaalex37> oh i see, so its not the language its the engines?
[01:16:22] <yamahaalex37> but what engines power c++
[01:16:24] <yamahaalex37> directx?
[01:16:33] <sam113101> nothing, it's compiled
[01:16:38] <coldhead> the language imposes certain limitations which is why there are new languages like Dart
[01:16:44] <yamahaalex37> oh
[01:16:55] <coldhead> but you can write fast JS for a fast engine
[01:17:06] <yamahaalex37> so dart will be a more powerful web language?
[01:17:11] <coldhead> supposedly
[01:17:38] <yamahaalex37> thats cool
[01:17:39] <yamahaalex37> what about python
[01:17:50] * tw2113 has no dart enthusiasm
[01:18:16] <yamahaalex37> python vs dart?
[01:18:39] <y3di> coldhead: you dont think google pushing dart is bad for the browser ecosystem?
[01:18:44] <tw2113> i'd try python first personally
[01:18:57] <y3di> yamahaalex37: they have different use cases
[01:19:03] <coldhead> at this stage python is a way better language because it's been around for a thousand years and has libs and testers and so on
[01:19:04] <yamahaalex37> thought so
[01:19:11] <yamahaalex37> but python cant be used to manipulate the dom?
[01:19:11] <coldhead> dart is just a crazy dream at the moment
[01:19:22] <Es0teric> wtf is DART?
[01:19:31] <y3di> yamahaalex37: you cant use anything except js client side
[01:19:36] <tw2113> ?g google dart
[01:19:37] <bot-t> tw2113, Dart (programming language) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language)
[01:19:37] <coldhead> python COULD manipulat ethe dom if you wrote a python to JS compiler
[01:19:38] <y3di> yamahaalex37: cept for dart on chrome
[01:19:51] <yamahaalex37> really
[01:20:08] <coldhead> y3di: i'm sure diversity is good for ecosystems
[01:20:09] <yamahaalex37> but you could do a powerful 3d browser game with python?
[01:20:16] <yamahaalex37> i thought it was good for web apps
[01:20:17] <coldhead> natural selection and all that
[01:20:43] <coldhead> it probably wouldn't be your first choice, yamahaalex37
[01:21:06] <yamahaalex37> hm, i just heard a lot of positive things about python and thought it was used for web apps alot
[01:21:15] <y3di> yamahaalex37: what you have to realize is that theres a difference between code running client side and server side...
[01:21:17] <coldhead> it;s good on servers
[01:21:43] <yamahaalex37> so for client side, you would have to do what? install a web client?
[01:21:47] <yamahaalex37> like Unity 3d games?
[01:22:52] <y3di> yamahaalex37: im a bit confused by what you're asking. But what i was saying is that browsers ONLY execute javascript code. (and dart for chrome)
[01:23:09] <yamahaalex37> ok, makes sense, thansk
[01:23:21] <coldhead> but if you hate JS you can write something else like Coffeescript or Clojurescript and compile it to JS
[01:23:28] <y3di> yamahaalex37: any language that wants to be run client side needs to be converted to js.
[01:23:30] <y3di> right
[01:23:34] <sneakyness> y3di: that's not true
[01:23:38] <sneakyness> they can run java applets too
[01:23:41] <yamahaalex37> i dont mind js. but im also into game dev. just wondering what will be the future for powerful 3d in browser
[01:23:46] <sam113101> or flash
[01:23:48] <sam113101> lol
[01:23:56] <y3di> sneakyness: true, but ijsnt that simply a plugin
[01:24:04] <sam113101> yes
[01:24:05] <y3di> it isn't native
[01:24:06] <coldhead> the future of powerful 3d in browser is probably violent erotica
[01:24:19] <coldhead> given human nature
[01:24:35] <tw2113> took me long enough to get strong interest in js
[01:24:44] <y3di> lol coldhead, porn sites will definitely be the early adopters for that tech
[01:24:53] <tw2113> and i was claiming front end developer
[01:25:09] <sneakyness> coldhead: so true
[01:25:10] <tw2113> porn sites were already adapting last year
[01:25:14] <y3di> tw2113: how do you claim front end developer without knowing js?
[01:25:26] <Es0teric> the day i see porn sites use HTML5 and not flash...
[01:25:26] <sneakyness> his job was to re-code the site in real time
[01:25:28] <Es0teric> that will be
[01:25:29] <Es0teric> so awesome
[01:25:30] <sneakyness> instead of having js
[01:25:34] <sneakyness> Es0teric: already exists
[01:25:35] <tw2113> html/css/beginner js y3di
[01:25:42] <Es0teric> SHOW ME, sneakyness
[01:25:46] <sneakyness> google
[01:25:54] <Es0teric> ...........
[01:26:00] <y3di> tw2113: more like web designer, but w/e works lol
[01:26:01] <Es0teric> anyways
[01:26:03] <sneakyness> show a man a porn site, he'll fap for a day, show a man how to find porn sites, and he'll fap for life
[01:26:11] <sneakyness> coldhead: amirite/
[01:26:14] <tw2113> no, designers to me create PSD files
[01:26:14] <y3di> Es0teric: ideally everuone will switch to html5 video
[01:26:18] <coldhead> hahahha terrible
[01:26:32] <Es0teric> sneakyness, you talkin to a person to gets free bangbros/etc passwords man
[01:26:39] <sneakyness> woaahhh guys
[01:26:41] <sneakyness> we have a badass over here
[01:26:45] <y3di> can't wait to see native support for p2p in html5+
[01:26:46] <Es0teric> thats right
[01:26:50] <Es0teric> im like brock obama, son
[01:27:04] <sneakyness> that's funny because i AM brock obama
[01:27:05] <tw2113> who's brock obama?
[01:27:17] <y3di> http://th03.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2011/064/a/6/brock_obama_by_jhallpokemon-d3azqf0.png
[01:27:40] <tw2113> new one to me
[01:28:28] <yamahaalex37> why are my borders round in ie
[01:28:35] <yamahaalex37> but i can still see square backgrounds behind them
[01:28:50] <Es0teric> y3di got the wrong oneâ€¦ http://loyalkng.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/BrockObama.jpg
[01:44:49] <diverdude> is it possible to call a function on a set of objects? like if object a has function tst() and i have an array with a-objects can i do myarray.tst() somehow ? and automatically tst() is called on each a-object
[01:55:50] <stoosh> baseball
[01:58:17] <stoosh> with ui autocomplete, the source url automatically appends ?term=%s onto the end, is there a way to reformat that? i need it to be /search/%s.json
[02:11:35] <InDigital> !hello vaic
[02:31:47] <shesek> stoosh, I don't think you can
[02:31:56] <shesek> I believe you gonna have to use a callback
[02:32:53] <shesek> source: function(request, response) { $.get('/search/' + encodeURIComponent(request.term), response, 'json') } should do the trick
[02:34:14] <shesek> or as a reusable solution - autocompleteFormat = (url) -> (request, response) -> $.get (url.replace '%s', encodeURIComponent request.term), response, 'json'
[02:34:32] <shesek> than `source: autocompleteFormat '/search/%s'`
[02:34:56] <stoosh> shesek: thanks
[02:34:57] <shesek> (too lazy to write in JavaScript, head over to coffeescript.org -> Try to convert it to JavaScript)
[02:35:13] <stoosh> shesek: i'll see what results i can get
[02:56:06] <Sonderblade> what is the best treeview plugin for jquery?
[03:14:37] <adac> Hi! On click on one of my div the text within the div should be editable. Does anyone know how to achieve that?

[03:28:49] <dabear> fotoflo: it's not
[03:29:15] <dabear> fotoflo: see ?p
[03:29:16] <bot-t> fotoflo, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:30:20] <fotoflo> http://pastebin.com/bpykGpa1
[03:30:49] <fotoflo> just a sec
[03:30:54] <fotoflo> appending the output
[03:31:36] <fotoflo> http://pastebin.com/VKfH68bi  <--- code and console logging output,   when you call this function it returns undefined
[03:32:43] <fotoflo> dabear: any idears?
[03:34:53] <dabear> either the code inside the if check isn't reached
[03:35:16] <dabear> or document.currentPlaylist.videos[i+1] is undefined
[03:36:33] <fotoflo> dabear: but the console.log("next video = " + document.currentPlaylist.videos[i+1].ID);  outputs "next video = 27"  , and then I'm returning  document.currentPlaylist.videos[i+1] which is obviously defined, cause I'm logging that.ID in the previous line
[03:37:37] <dabear> fotoflo: ah, got it
[03:37:54] <dabear> when you return, you return from the function inside the .each
[03:38:18] <fotoflo> dabear: ah, i get ya
[03:38:39] <fotoflo> so it should be a = 	$.each(document.currentPlaylist.videos, b = function(i, video){
[03:38:40] <fotoflo> a or b?
[03:40:22] <fotoflo> after a quick a/b test
[03:40:25] <fotoflo> the answer is....
[03:40:26] <fotoflo> a!
[03:40:32] <fotoflo> thanks dabear
[03:40:34] <fotoflo> ;-)
[03:42:08] <fotoflo> nope
[03:42:11] <fotoflo> thats not right either!
[03:43:17] <fotoflo> the answer is C: first create var myReturn =
[03:43:17] <kanzie> is there any way I can prevent $.ajax() from piping my XML through $.parseXML() ?
[03:43:25] <fotoflo> '';  then set it inside the $each; and return
[03:43:36] <kanzie> Its leaking to much memory so I need to parse it using something else
[03:43:48] <dabear> kanzie: yocan set content type to text
[03:43:52] <dabear> see the docs
[03:44:28] <kanzie> dabear: think I tried that but it still messed it up when the response header said xml
[03:44:31] <kanzie> Ill try
[03:44:31] <kanzie> thanks
[03:47:04] <kanzie> yeah, still leakingâ€¦1MB per second
[04:24:15] <zatan> hi, how can I animate from the top bar ? http://jsfiddle.net/e3Z5j/
[04:27:08] <kanzie> If Im storing the ajax()-object in a local var. What is the best way to clear it to avoid retaining any memory? Just setting it to null or should I delete it or do I have to traverse down into it and clear out individual functions?
[04:29:31] <fat_Mike> zatan, I'm no expert nor am I sure if this is what you wanted http://jsfiddle.net/e3Z5j/1/
[04:32:43] <fat_Mike> I modified this example  http://jsfiddle.net/juMkx/  here http://jsfiddle.net/juMkx/2/  I don't  understand why BlueDiv contents isn't displayed.. Thank You
[04:37:35] <Guest__> anyone here?
[04:38:15] <Zed7> yep
[04:45:28] <Guest__> Zed7 are u there?
[04:51:10] <Zed7> yep
[04:52:04] <Guest__> https://gist.github.com/1916516
[04:52:09] <Guest__> can u tell me whats wrong with this code
[04:53:36] <Zed7> hmm nothing stands out
[04:54:06] <fat_Mike> Guest__, what are you trying to do?
[04:54:21] <Guest__> im trying to use this example to test if ajax works properly
[04:54:27] <Guest__> i mean parsing json
[04:54:34] <Guest__> so i used this tewitter technique
[04:55:25] <fat_Mike> ah ok. can't help much cause it went over my head
[04:55:51] <Guest__> Do u have any different examples for json?
[04:56:25] <fat_Mike> no not at all, I'm really a novice
[04:57:06] <Guest__> lol same here
[04:57:14] <dabear> $.jsonp ???
[04:57:30] <Zed7> yea its json with padding
[04:57:43] <dabear> ?
[04:57:51] <dabear> I know what jsonp is
[04:57:57] <dabear> but $.jsonp
[04:58:01] <dabear> does not exist
[04:58:20] <Guest__> What do u mean it doesnt exist?
[04:58:32] <dabear> there is no method called $.jsonp is there?
[04:58:44] <Guest__> umm no there isnt
[04:58:45] <Guest__> :S
[04:58:49] <Guest__> what should i do to fix it?
[04:59:06] <dabear> ?ajax @ Guest__
[04:59:06] <bot-t> Guest__, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[04:59:53] <Axsuul> Any good way to detect a hashchange event?
[05:00:07] <dabear> yep
[05:00:13] <dabear> ben alman has a plugin
[05:00:18] <Axsuul> other than using the jquery hashchange plugin (I don't want the history)
[05:00:21] <dabear> ?g ben alman hashchange
[05:00:23] <bot-t> dabear, Ben Alman » jQuery hashchange event - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[05:00:32] <dabear> ok
[05:00:34] <Axsuul> dabear: is there any way to disable that history?
[05:00:36] <dabear> why can't you use that?
[05:00:55] <Axsuul> I don't want to store the histroy of hash changes
[05:01:28] <Axsuul> That is, user clicks around, and then proceeds to back, but go back an the previous page
[05:04:53] <dabear> gotta modify the plugin then
[05:08:39] <Guest__> damn jquery is hard :(
[05:10:46] <K3|Chris|Work> naw
[05:10:46] <dabear> Guest__: generally, jquery is easy if you know javascript. you should know javascript before looking at jquery
[05:11:10] <Axsuul> dabear: doh ok thanks
[05:11:24] <Guest__> yeah dont have time to learn a new language as my due date is in a few months
[05:11:30] <dabear> naw? yaw?
[05:11:32] <Guest__> cant be slacking off :(
[05:14:09] <fotoflo> dabear: i learned query at about the same time as js and found that learning jQuery made a lot of javascript tasks much easier --- and really that there is no need to learn javascript without jquery
[05:14:24] <fotoflo> at least if you are only concentrating on modern browsers
[05:14:57] <NiLon> what the?
[05:15:03] <dabear> point is - you need to understand what's happening
[05:15:07] <Guest__> Do any of u have an example of a jquery ajax for parsing a json?
[05:15:11] <NiLon> jquery is javascript, nothing else
[05:15:16] <dabear> without any understanding of the language that's not possible
[05:15:25] <dabear> and will result in lots of noobish questions here
[05:15:55] <fotoflo> right-o
[05:16:03] <Guest__> ill learn along the way
[05:16:12] <NiLon> some people have misunderstanding that jquery will add something to javascript, it won't
[05:17:52] <Guest__> i know the basics of javascript
[05:18:29] <dabear> Guest__: $.ajax({type: "GET",url: "test.foo",dataType: "jsonp"}).done( function( data){ /* use data here*/ } );
[05:18:53] <Guest__> thank you dabear
[05:19:29] <dabear> apparently not, because if you do know the basics, you would be able to combine the docs ( http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/) with the examples on the same page
[05:19:38] <dabear> and create that single line I just gave you
[05:19:47] <rickibalboa> Guest__, you can use $.getJSON() aswell I believe.
[05:19:51] <seion> hey with jquery tabs, I can load the page into the tab by just doing this right? <li><a href="dsl.html">DSL</a></li>
[05:31:59] <Wiz_KeeD> i have a question, if i have a button.click(function(){}) and withing that callback function i do a .each(function() {}) that returns false, apparently the script keeps running and doesn't stop it dead in it's tracks as it should
[05:32:08] <Wiz_KeeD> any advice on how to counter that?
[05:37:58] <Wiz_KeeD> anyone please?
[05:42:44] <Wiz_KeeD> hello...
[05:51:34] <Wiz_KeeD> ffs nobody talks in here?
[05:51:55] <raygerrard> ?
[05:52:38] <nathggns> Wiz_KeeD, why would people talk in here? It's a support channel..
[05:53:19] <Wiz_KeeD> i've asked a question, i should at least desirve a "bugger off"
[05:53:29] <nathggns> Sorry, I didn't see that.
[05:53:33] <nathggns> What was your question?
[05:54:16] <Wiz_KeeD> i want to check if all input fields are filled
[05:54:24] <Wiz_KeeD> and i do this on the click of a button using each
[05:54:32] <Wiz_KeeD> if i return false it's the equiv of break
[05:54:38] <Wiz_KeeD> so i've read
[05:54:38] <nathggns> uh
[05:54:52] <Wiz_KeeD> and in order to return false when i see an empty input
[05:55:07] <Wiz_KeeD> i need to use each with a bool var and return false outside of the each function
[05:55:20] <Wiz_KeeD> that, or maybe there is a better way to determine if all the fields in one form are not completed
[05:55:26] <raygerrard> http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[05:55:27] <Wiz_KeeD> that was my question
[05:55:42] <nathggns> just do
[05:56:13] <nathggns> $("input[type=text").filter(function() { return $(this).val().length == 0}).length
[05:56:24] <nathggns> $("input[type=text").filter(function() { return $(this).val().length == 0; }).length *
[05:57:01] <Wiz_KeeD> that returns the number of empty fields?
[05:58:36] <nathggns> yes
[05:58:47] <nathggns> $("input[type=text]").filter(function() { return $(this).val().length == 0; }).length *
[05:58:50] <Wiz_KeeD> hmm, i get 0
[05:58:56] <Wiz_KeeD> what's with the *?
[05:59:48] <raygerrard> ignore tht
[06:00:24] <Wiz_KeeD> i get 0
[06:00:39] <Wiz_KeeD> no matter which field is completed or not
[06:00:56] <nathggns> sec
[06:01:16] <Wiz_KeeD> alert($(".ui-block-a input[type=number").filter(function() { return $(this).val().length == 0; }).length)
[06:01:46] <Wiz_KeeD> so that returns a boolean result of true if the value of the field is == to 0
[06:01:51] <Wiz_KeeD> shouldn't i do "" ?
[06:01:53] <Wiz_KeeD> ah wait
[06:01:56] <Wiz_KeeD> it's the length property
[06:02:14] <raygerrard> do your inputs have default values?
[06:02:20] <nathggns> I don't see why that shouldn't work
[06:03:10] <Wiz_KeeD> i use html5 and placeholders if that has any linkage
[06:03:18] <Wiz_KeeD> but if i iterate through them with each it works
[06:03:49] <nathggns> just debuffing now Wiz_KeeD
[06:03:58] <Wiz_KeeD> what?
[06:04:40] <nathggns> It works fine here - http://jsfiddle.net/VZeaT/
[06:04:41] <raygerrard> what are you trying to do
[06:05:31] <Wiz_KeeD> i do button.click(function(){})
[06:05:36] <Wiz_KeeD> if there is an empty field
[06:05:41] <Wiz_KeeD> inside the form it should return false
[06:05:45] <Wiz_KeeD> and bring up an alert
[06:06:02] <Wiz_KeeD> if i do that with each the return false from the each statement will act as a break instead of a false return of the parent callback function
[06:06:04] <nathggns> woops
[06:06:07] <nathggns> wrong channel for that
[06:06:19] <nathggns> Wiz_KeeD, jsfiddle it please
[06:06:25] <Wiz_KeeD> thus i was thinking maybe there's a better way to deal with it
[06:06:35] <Wiz_KeeD> or i can just use a bool var in the each and return false out of it
[06:06:37] <Wiz_KeeD> but it's just messy
[06:06:49] <nathggns> I don't see why filter isn't the right way to do it
[06:09:37] <Wiz_KeeD> doesn't work at all in jsfiddle
[06:09:37] <Wiz_KeeD> http://jsfiddle.net/Ajz2P/
[06:10:36] <raygerrard> $("input[type=number]").each(function() { if( $(this).val().length === 0 ) { alert("nothing entered") } });
[06:10:46] <Vorspire> why use alert? especially in .filter
[06:10:57] <nathggns> he's not even using filter
[06:11:09] <nathggns> wait
[06:11:10] <nathggns> is he
[06:11:16] <nathggns> oh yeah
[06:11:23] <nathggns> ignore that
[06:11:24] <Vorspire> argh you don't even need to do operator comparison for truthy length - 0 is false, everything else is true
[06:11:36] <Vorspire> if(obj.length)
[06:11:51] <Wiz_KeeD> i see there's no easy way around this
[06:11:56] <Wiz_KeeD> i'll just use each and a bool
[06:12:00] <Vorspire> what is the ultimate goal?
[06:12:15] <qbmaniac> Hi all :)
[06:13:04] <Wiz_KeeD> ffs i'm saying this for the 11th time, when i click a button to submit the form i want to check and see if all the inputs of type number from a div have all values
[06:13:15] <Wiz_KeeD> and that none of them have been left empty
[06:13:28] <qbmaniac> Wiz, just assign a class called "number" or something
[06:13:31] <Vorspire> well if you explain it properly the first time, you wouldn't have to say it 11 times.
[06:13:32] <qbmaniac> then use jquery validate plugin
[06:13:38] <qbmaniac> and just validate for that class
[06:13:39] <qbmaniac> ?
[06:13:56] <chee> urg
[06:13:58] <raygerrard> i already gave him the link
[06:14:14] <Wiz_KeeD> just for this simple task use a whole plugin?
[06:14:15] <raygerrard> hes looking for a line of code he can just paste into his script that does it all for him
[06:14:20] <nathggns> well just get the ones that ARE empty with the thing I gave you, then test the length
[06:14:28] <nathggns> Yes raygerrard
[06:14:31] <qbmaniac> Wiz: That is the best way to go, you might need the plugin again in the future
[06:14:33] <qbmaniac> for other tasks
[06:14:37] <Vorspire> we don't spoon feed here
[06:14:51] <qbmaniac> Curious question for you guys today: Say I have a hidden textbox and then I show it using .show() and then I try to bind this to it... $("#title").keyup(function(event) { alert("bound"); }); ... but it never actually works... any ideas why this would be happening?
[06:14:54] <Wiz_KeeD> who's talking about spoon feeding, i know how to do it i was just looking for a better more optimised way
[06:14:57] <Wiz_KeeD> nvm
[06:14:59] <Wiz_KeeD> thanks guys
[06:15:06] <qbmaniac> Wiz: The plugin is tiny! stop moaning :)
[06:15:14] <Vorspire> filter isn't the right way in this context
[06:15:22] <Wiz_KeeD> haha
[06:15:27] <Wiz_KeeD> there is a problem i really can't seem to fix though
[06:16:58] <qbmaniac> I think I phrased my question too long... I'll try simplifying... any reason .keyup() would not be bound to an input after dynamically making the input visible?
[06:20:29] <raygerrard> use .live('click', function() { });
[06:21:40] <Vorspire> 1. The element may not support KeyUp events, try KeyPress. 2. Are you creating the element from nothing, or does it already exist, but hidden?
[06:24:22] <SirFunk> If my server returns an error to an ajax request with json.. how do i access that json in the error callback?
[06:24:44] <SirFunk> it seemms to just be a string in response.responseText
[06:25:04] <sarah|mbp> http://69.164.217.134/ <-- any insight why nivo slider isn't loading
[06:25:15] <raygerrard> http://api.jquery.com/ajaxError/
[06:26:02] <sarah|mbp> sorry, i'm fairly new to jquery -- but i did make sure the DOM is loaded -- but it is like the js is not loading -- at least the error i'm getting in console
[06:26:53] <sarah|mbp> maybe i just should use a wordpress plugin
[06:27:36] <dabear> sarah|mbp: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'nivoSlider'
[06:27:55] <dabear> so the plugin isn't loaded
[06:28:43] <sarah|mbp> dabear: thanks, i got that from the console -- but the script is accessible and i think i'm loading it
[06:29:09] <sarah|mbp> i have it loading here: http://crossfitadaptation.com/
[06:29:58] <dabear> sarah|mbp: problem is, jquery is loaded twice
[06:30:16] <sarah|mbp> ah -- i was suspecting such
[06:30:17] <dabear> jquery.js?ver=1.71
[06:30:26] <dabear> and from google apis
[06:30:34] <dabear> 1.4.3
[06:30:34] <sarah|mbp> because i load it manually -- and wordpress forces it
[06:30:53] <sarah|mbp> so i'll remove the cdn reference
[06:33:08] <sarah|mbp> darnit -- now no jquery is loading .  .
[06:41:38] <Pooky5> Hi guys, I have little problem.http://pastie.org/3463794 - it's just brief explain my problem, in real is it little bit more complicated
[06:42:11] <Deele> how do we add css property, that contains - mark inside
[06:42:15] <Deele> like background-imagfe
[06:42:20] <Deele> *background-image
[06:44:05] <Pooky5> Deele: use .css() ?
[06:44:15] <Deele> Pooky5, yes, when using css
[06:44:55] <Deele> .css({ background-image: "url('image.jpg')" });
[06:45:06] <Deele> it is cursing about that dash
[06:45:31] <WesleyL> put ' '  around it
[06:47:04] <svat> hi, how can I execute some jquery code when the value of a radio button changes?
[06:47:12] <svat> which radio button is selected, I mean
[06:47:14] <Pooky5> Deele: use this css("background-image","url('image.jpg')");
[06:47:44] <Pooky5> svat: did you try use $(this).val()
[06:49:49] <svat> Pooky5: what is $(this)?
[06:50:04] <svat> Pooky5: not the id of the div that contains the radio button; that doesn't work, at least
[06:50:07] <svat> (obviously)
[06:50:23] <KyouJin-SaMa> svat as in $("#myRadio").change(function(){...}); ?
[06:51:48] <KyouJin-SaMa> svat : probably what u're looking for  http://api.jquery.com/change/
[06:52:17] <Pooky5> better is $("input [name='radio-button']").change()
[06:52:59] * KyouJin-SaMa ups Pooky5's suggestion
[06:53:06] <KyouJin-SaMa> better indeed
[06:55:08] <svat> hmm, thanks, that seems to bind to the change... but the value I'm getting is always "on"
[06:55:40] <Pooky5> svat: can you use paste and show your code?
[06:58:49] <svat> relevant bits: http://jsfiddle.net/3p6Sm/
[06:59:05] <svat> Pooky5: I think I may have got the HTML markup wrong :) But I don't know the right way
[07:01:38] <Pooky5> svat: it works - http://jsfiddle.net/3p6Sm/2/
[07:03:10] <svat> Pooky5: indeed! Thanks

[08:21:42] <tomasm-> hi, is there a way to MOVE content from one container to another? I try a basic get/set html() and unfortunately that seems to have some weird glitches with script eval's that update containers that end up getting lost
[08:21:43] <kurol> you could use any plugin, just not use the css
[08:22:54] <ThiefMaster> hi, is it possible to make a dialog half-modal, e.g. just to a certain element instead of the whole document?
[08:23:01] <Guest12916> kurol: hahah
[08:23:10] <Guest12916> kurol: Funny how these things don't occur to me some times.
[08:23:18] <ThiefMaster> (before someone asks what kind of dialog: jquery ui)
[08:29:02] <hlve> Is it possible to use .wrap to wrap two sep. elements in a div?
[08:29:05] <hlve> o,O
[08:30:12] <hlve> ah, well. i guess i can just use before, and after.
[08:30:39] <hlve> agh, nevermind. it's auto closing the div.
[08:32:29] <hlve> Wrapall?
[08:32:30] <hlve> o,o
[08:42:58] <krucial> I am trying to implement an infinite scroll type of mechanism, so that if scrollTop = 0, I request more data.  My issue is, I can't cancel the "hold" of the scrollbar.  Is this possible?  I basically want to programmatically release the grab of the scrollbar for the user so that they'd need to re-grab it again
[08:51:37] <tomasm-> anyone know if theres a way to make a dialog box never be taller than the window, and to add scrollbars if needed?
[08:53:27] <aaairc> could anyone recommend a youtube plugin for a popup youtube lightbox?
[08:56:48] <diverdude> Is it possible to read the property values of a CSS class from jquery?
[08:58:29] <imsky> sort of
[08:58:56] <hlve> Is this even possible?
[08:59:01] <imsky> sort of
[08:59:01] * hlve slams head against keyboard.
[08:59:07] <hlve> Is it possible to use .wrap to wrap two sep. elements in a div?
[08:59:21] <imsky> sort..oh
[08:59:40] <imsky> ?wrapAll @ hlve
[08:59:40] <bot-t> hlve, .wrapAll(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around all elements in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapAll/
[08:59:59] <hlve> that's what I thought, just didn't know if that was the best way to approach it
[09:00:00] <hlve> thanks :)
[09:01:06] <diverdude> imsky: do you know if its possible to read the value of a property defined in a css class?
[09:01:26] <imsky> it's possible, yes
[09:01:39] <diverdude> imsky: how can i do that?
[09:01:57] <diverdude> $('selector').css('propname');  is no good
[09:02:43] <imsky> start here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/CSSStyleSheet
[09:04:36] <widoz> hi, i read this page http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4316, beacouse i've that problem, i've donwloaded the jqueryui from this page http://jqueryui.com/download, but i'ven't found this string c.effects.restore(a, n?e:g); some one can explain me, how can i resolve my problem?
[09:05:58] <aaairc> can anyone recommend a youtube jquery plugin?
[09:07:58] <sam113101> a plugin for what
[09:09:31] <diverdude> imsky: aha so i have to use document.styleSheets?
[09:10:03] <rookie84> $('.span'+i)+css('background', '#BBD8E9'); <-- how do i get this added to <style></style> to <head>
[09:11:55] <imsky> diverdude: yep, make sure you understand that object, and then find its companions in webkit and ie
[09:14:09] <razzi> rookie84, on which element does the class .span apply, span?
[09:14:20] <diverdude> imsky: hmm do you know if some lib exists for parsing this object properly so that it works cross-browser?
[09:14:39] <rookie84> razzi: yes exactly.
[09:15:35] <rookie84> razzi: i got it :)
[09:15:41] <rookie84> i had a + instead of a dot (.)
[09:15:43] <rookie84> thanks !
[09:15:44] <imsky> diverdude: not off the top of my head. you should search for it
[09:15:45] <razzi> rookie84, try <style> [class^=span] { background-color: #bbd8e9 } </style>
[09:16:17] <rookie84> ok what does [class^=span] mean?
[09:16:24] <rookie84> its a CSS solution i see
[09:16:46] <razzi> i thought you wanted the CSS equivalent of that jQuery code
[09:17:03] <rookie84> yes i want that, now :)
[09:17:43] <rookie84> ^= what this means?
[09:18:17] <imsky> lol
[09:18:34] <razzi> rookie, [class^=span] means select all classes that start with "span"
[09:20:31] <diverdude> imsky: ok it seems to be quite easy
[09:20:41] <diverdude> imsky: i dont think a lib will be necessary
[09:20:50] <imsky> alright buddy, have fun
[09:21:48] <diverdude> imsky: thx for the info :)
[09:25:41] <imsky> np
[09:26:23] <rookie84> rizzi: thanks but what if i wanted to be span classes starting from span1 to span12 :)
[09:35:56] <imsky> lol?
[09:55:03] <diverdude> I have an object with a property cssText: ".chatbox { bottom: 0px; position: fixed; z-index: 10; width: 150px; }". What is the best way to extract the width value from this property?
[09:55:41] <pspeter3> Sometimes my append calls are causing the browser to scroll back to the top of the page. Does anyone know why this would be?
[09:57:37] <seion> hey with jquery tabs, I can load the page into the tab by just doing this right? <li><a href="dsl.html">DSL</a></li>
[10:00:42] <lekefly_> Anyone that could help me get this updated on a ajax reload? $("form.jqtransform").jqTransform();
[10:02:25] <rob_> hi, how can i add a class to all tags that contain a certain value?
[10:02:47] <rob_> is it as simple as doing: $('td').attr('someval').addClass('foo'); ?
[10:09:17] <nFFF> rob_, change your selector
[10:10:15] <rob_> nFFF: to what?
[10:10:39] <nFFF> td[value="someval"]
[10:11:12] <nFFF> or
[10:11:18] <nFFF> td[someval="someval"]
[10:11:31] <nFFF> depending what you name your attribue
[10:12:05] <seion> hey with jquery tabs, I can load the page into the tab by just doing this right? <li><a href="dsl.html">DSL</a></li>
[10:12:06] <rob_> i want it to be the value of the table cell
[10:23:50] <Druid_> http://ln.tc/xoJdXp
[10:23:51] <tomasm-> hi, how do I get the resize handler for a resizeable to be triggered from code itself (not the mouse)? calling trigger('resize') doesnt work  =(
[10:24:04] <jks222222> Hey
[10:25:40] <jks222222> Could someone explain this to me? if($("#email").val()=="") I get that it says If the value email is empty and then it lists actions. but what are the roles of the $ and #?
[10:26:04] <mansoor> jks222222, $ is just a character lik   a  or b  or c
[10:26:12] <mansoor> it is the jQuery object
[10:26:22] <tomasm-> $("#email") means get the dom object with email as an ID attribute
[10:26:33] <tomasm-> # means id attribute
[10:26:41] <jks222222> Oh ok
[10:33:34] <shiftingcontrol> I have div tag which is appended by jquery periodically, overflow: auto, but whenever div is updated the focus lies in first line not in last line, how to focus on last line
[10:37:27] <tomasm-> how do i detect if a box has a scrollbar in a given direction (ie horizontally)? I want to add to the width until the scrollbar is gone
[10:38:24] <Kit-10> width < scrollWidth??
[10:38:25] <jrockjiggz> maybe detect overflow-x
[10:41:10] <tomasm-> yeah, $(this).width($(this).prop('scrollWidth')) eliminates the horiz scrollbar
[10:42:40] <tomasm-> shiftingcontrol, look into the scrollTo  plugin, that's what I use (unless others have better ideas). you just need to do something like $(window).scrollTo('#newElementId', { offset: -15 }) # offset is optional, but nice
[10:43:16] <shiftingcontrol> tomasm-, let me try ,
[10:43:32] <tomasm-> shiftingcontrol, it's a 3rd party plugin, not part of the jquery core
[10:44:17] <shiftingcontrol> tomasm-, oh, $('.class').children().last().focus() din work
[10:45:15] <tomasm-> shiftingcontrol, focus() only works on form elements
[10:45:57] <shiftingcontrol> tomasm-, yes, is it possible to make scroll bar to scroll to end ?
[10:47:09] <tomasm-> shiftingcontrol, scrollTo just takes the target as the element, it will make sure its on the screen. it helps to have ID's associated with these elements
[10:47:28] <shiftingcontrol> ok thanks I will try
[11:01:09] <bittyx-laptop> hi all. i have an old site that uses jquery 1.6.1 and jquery ui. can i safely change to 1.7.1 and 1.8.18, respectively, without breaking anything? or can you point me to any kind of migration guide, so i wouldn't have to go over all the changelogs between the versions (and probably miss something)
[11:01:35] <bittyx-laptop> (since i skipped it, the jquery ui version used currently is 1.8.13)
[11:01:42] <nobitanobi> I have a drop down menu which has anchor elements in each option element.  What's the approach to be able to send the user to the particular chosen page when he changes the option value of that dropdown?
[11:02:25] <LekeFly> Whats the correct way to do something like this http://pastebin.com/v5u8VFjz
[11:03:46] <peterschmidler> What's wrong with this: $(".pager").find("a").eq(0).hide()
[11:04:23] <razzi> LekeFly, i would write one function for all the images, and inside the function i would extract the number somehow ... probably by filtering the class value
[11:04:25] <bittyx-laptop> LekeFly: i'd probably generate the html as <img class="some-image" data-target-id="0" ... /> <img class="some-image" data-target-id="1" ... /> ... and do something like $(".some-image").click(function(){ sliderInstance.goTo($(this).attr('data-target-id'); });
[11:04:49] <bittyx-laptop> or what razzi suggests, though i dislike parsing strings like that
[11:05:04] <bittyx-laptop> also, check if data-target-id is set in the first place within the function
[11:06:16] <LekeFly> bittyx-laptop: Hmm alright..
[11:07:08] <Wiz_KeeD> since no one in jquery mobile is answeing, what way is there to navigate to another page with $.mobile.changePage( "/mobile-client/") and when finished to display an alert?
[11:10:04] <nobitanobi> I have a drop down with <a> elements. How can I use onChange to perform that "link to" when a particular option is selected?
[11:10:13] <nobitanobi> I mean, what should I put on the onChange?
[11:10:45] <nobitanobi> right now, with plain HTML is not triggering the <a> action
[11:11:22] <LekeFly> razzi & bittyx-laptop would i really "save" or gain any preformance by doing it that way.. ?
[11:12:06] <bittyx-laptop> you gain code readability, maintainability, and extensibility with that.
[11:12:06] <razzi> LekeFly, you gain (very little) load time and memory usage, you lose (very little) speed
[11:12:27] <bittyx-laptop> code readability is obvious i think
[11:12:30] <LekeFly> Oh and any idea how i can apply a class to the class that is clicked.. that gets removed when you click another
[11:12:36] <bittyx-laptop> maintainability - easier to debug like that
[11:12:40] <LekeFly> yeah i see
[11:12:52] <bittyx-laptop> extensibility - this way enables you to easily add more such images on the server-side, without changing the js at all
[11:13:05] <bittyx-laptop> also, if you want to change what happens when an image is clicked, you change it in a single place
[11:17:20] <Wiz_KeeD> since no one in jquery mobile is answeing, what way is there to navigate to another page with $.mobile.changePage( "/mobile-client/") and when finished to display an alert?
[11:25:53] <diverdude> when is the init method of a jquery plugin called?
[11:38:04] <ningu> I'm trying to use resizable on a table, so it can be resized horizontally, i.e. I specify handles: 'e'. it works, but in the process of making the table wider, some cells that had wrapped no longer wrap -- however, the table's *height* does not shrink to compensate.
[11:38:09] <ningu> is there any way to make the browser do that?
[11:38:33] <ningu> I noticed that if I do ghost: true, the ghosted preview changes size appropriately -- but not when the resize actually happens.

[12:41:44] <fraxture> hi all, i'm using jquery/ajax to submit a form via POST to a php file that initiates a download.  if i set the php file up for the GET method and call it directly it works, but when i call it via jquery/ajax in my site, the site seems to freeze.  here's the jquery code: http://pastebin.com/X18WMyR5

[12:47:32] <pif> hi, how can I attach an 'onchange="submit()"' to all popup inputs?
[12:54:12] <fraxture> just putting this question up one more time, as i'm a bit desperate ;):  i'm using jquery/ajax to submit a form via POST to a php file that initiates a download.  if i set the php file up for the GET method and call it directly it works, but when i call it via jquery/ajax in my site, the site seems to freeze.  here's the jquery code: http://pastebin.com/X18WMyR5
[13:01:19] <EnderMB_> Hey all. I'm using this bit of JavaScript to move a div (circle) down a page once the user scrolls past certain div's. It works going down, but when I use clearInterval() it won't go back up again. How can I fix this bit of code to get it to go up as well as down? https://gist.github.com/1918927
[13:18:35] <lahwran> hi, I'd like to make it so that any time an element that matches a certain query is created, the query is re-run to change it

[14:03:23] <Sovetryne> Hello... It has been 15 years ago, I tried IRC, so please tell me if I am on the right place
[14:03:44] <Sovetryne> Is this a chat room about jQuery?
[14:03:59] <sam113101> seems like it is
[14:04:26] <sam113101> welcome on #jquery bro
[14:04:29] <Sovetryne> Good! Thank you! I feel I'm a teenager again, using IRC :) LOL
[14:04:36] <Sovetryne> Thanks!
[14:04:56] <Sovetryne> I would like to ask for some help on a jQuery thingie
[14:06:12] <Sovetryne> Please checkout http://flikz.eu/body.php
[14:06:50] <Sovetryne> The page is empty, in IE8 you get an error at the status bar.
[14:07:40] <Sovetryne> Please view the source code, and tell me what I am doing wrong... Probably several things, since I'm a newbie in jQuery.
[14:08:10] <sam113101> you need to include jquery
[14:08:14] <cesaro> you didnt load jquery
[14:08:15] <cesaro> lol
[14:08:17] <cesaro> yeah
[14:08:26] <SwordArMor> Why you don't include your page with PHP?
[14:08:27] <cesaro> also use 'web developer -> view console' in firefox to actually see the errors.
[14:08:47] <Sovetryne> OK, I will try... Please hold on...
[14:09:12] <SwordArMor> It's easier
[14:09:58] <Sovetryne> Is this what you meant, sam113101?
[14:10:23] <Sovetryne> Added: <script language="text/javascript" scr="./jq/jquery-1.7.1.js"></script>
[14:11:14] <Sovetryne> @cesaro I know, but thanks, I just mentioned it to give as much as possible information
[14:11:40] <cesaro> ic
[14:11:41] <Sovetryne> Away from keyboard in 1 minute, wife wants to go to sleep :) LOL
[14:12:51] <thedeeno> does anyone know if jquery-ui is planning on adding 'dragover' support to droppable?
[14:13:18] <sam113101> you need to lift her and take her to bed?
[14:14:14] <sam113101> btw I'm pretty sure it's src and not scr
[14:14:15] <Sovetryne> LOL @ sam :) No, she gets disappointed if I don't say "hi" just before :)
[14:14:43] <Sovetryne> LOL
[14:15:23] <Sovetryne> Thanks sam, but that doesn't help much, although you are right :)
[14:18:07] <cooooooter> is their a way to catch a "400 (Bad Request)" javascript error when using $.getJSON
[14:19:00] <sam113101> Sovetryne: what are you trying to do? I don't think get does what you want it to do.
[14:21:19] <Sovetryne> Sam: I want read data out of a PHP-file using Javascript/jQuery.
[14:26:43] <johnkpaul> cooooooter: you can add a error callback
[14:26:48] <johnkpaul> to getJSON
[14:26:51] <johnkpaul> as long as it's not jsonp
[14:27:09] <cooooooter> I've tried that and it dosnt throw an error
[14:27:13] <Sovetryne> I guy on a danish forum told me, that $ is asynchronous. But is there a possibility to  get data synchronous out of an external file (e.g. test.php)?
[14:27:19] <johnkpaul> $.getJSON(url,data).error(func)
[14:27:19] <cooooooter> it still throws the javascript error, but it never gets to the .error
[14:27:36] <Sovetryne> (I am very new to jQuery, as you guys may have concluded)
[14:27:40] <johnkpaul> it throws a javascript error?
[14:27:51] <johnkpaul> cooooooter: can you put it into a fiddle?
[14:27:59] <cooooooter> sure
[14:28:17] <johnkpaul> Sovetryne: what are you trying to do
[14:29:26] <Sovetryne> Johnkpaul: I have a file (test.php) who reads some data from a database. I want to read the info from that file into a global variable in Javascript or jQuery
[14:29:45] <cooooooter> johnkpaul: http://jsfiddle.net/VUya6/
[14:30:09] <cooooooter> if you run it with 'cjstewart88' instead of undefined it works
[14:30:10] <sam113101> Sovetryne: you want to read more about ajax or ajaj
[14:30:14] <Sovetryne> Johnkpaul: check http://flikz.eu/test3.php - see source code
[14:30:49] <johnkpaul> cooooooter: ah, so it _is_ jsonp
[14:31:02] <sam113101> I prefer json to xml, but it's your choice
[14:31:19] <Sovetryne> Thanks sam. Is ajaj synchronous?
[14:32:07] <johnkpaul> Sovetryne: it stands for asyncronous javascript and xml/ and json
[14:32:08] <sam113101> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAJ
[14:32:22] <johnkpaul> cooooooter: so using jsonp, this is much more difficult
[14:32:36] <johnkpaul> you're going to have to look into readystates of script tags
[14:32:56] <johnkpaul> but that's not going to play nicely in a lot of browsers
[14:33:02] <cooooooter> fuck
[14:33:04] <johnkpaul> any chance you could use a server to proxy this?
[14:34:26] <cooooooter> not really sure what all that involves
[14:35:16] <johnkpaul> are you using any server side platform for this?
[14:35:39] <cooooooter> its a rails app running on heroku
[14:35:55] <xaa> fs
[14:35:55] <xaa> df
[14:36:01] <xaa> sfdsf
[14:36:01] <xaa> sdf
[14:36:01] <xaa> s
[14:36:01] <xaa> df
[14:36:01] <xaa> sdf
[14:36:21] <johnkpaul> cooooooter: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4319506/create-rails-proxy-for-json
[14:36:30] <cooooooter> are you suggestions do something with httparty and catch it there
[14:36:34] <cooooooter> suggesting*
[14:36:43] <cooooooter> mhm
[14:36:48] <johnkpaul> hm, I think so, but I don't know what httparty
[14:36:48] <johnkpaul> is
[14:37:32] <g0th> hi
[14:37:37] <cooooooter> fuck this is annoying, thanks for the idea though
[14:38:09] <g0th> how do I remove a div element with all its children from the html body (optionally: store it somewhere for insertion later)?
[14:38:13] <g0th> I know its id
[14:38:58] <johnkpaul> cooooooter: if you're used to rails, it really isn't that bad, it should only be another 4 or 5 lines of code
[14:39:18] <johnkpaul> g0th: var $div = $("div").remove()
[14:39:34] <johnkpaul> $div.appendTo(document.body) later
[14:40:03] <cooooooter> ya, its just I strive to run the majority of my app via JSâ€¦ i run a pretty heavily trafficked website and like to let the user's browser do the majority of the work :)
[14:40:32] <cooooooter> this is a pretty small feature though, dont think many people will be using it, just a few
[14:40:43] <cooooooter> btw, its tubalr.com, if you're curious
[14:40:58] <g0th> johnkpaul, nice, thx
[14:41:13] <johnkpaul> if you're really worried about performance, you could cache your outgoing http request
[14:41:23] <g0th> hmm?
[14:41:29] <johnkpaul> that was for cooooooter
[14:41:30] <cooooooter> and its on github if you're into contributing to shit: github.com/cjstewart88/Tubalr
[14:41:37] <johnkpaul> no problem g0th, have fun
[14:41:59] <johnkpaul> oh, I went to tubair.com
[14:42:02] <johnkpaul> and was very confused, cooooooter
[14:42:05] <cooooooter> lmao
[14:44:10] <g0th> johnkpaul: what if I want to remove several ids at the same time and store all of them somewhere, such that I can easily insert the whole content again?
[14:44:50] <johnkpaul> insert into the same place?
[14:45:01] <johnkpaul> and do you want the events and data to be maintained?
[14:45:24] <Sovetryne> I am not doubting about your willing to help me, but I guess I am just too much a newbie to understand your help... Gotta go! Bye all, and thanks
[14:47:45] <g0th> johnkpaul: hmm I was wondering what to do with events etc so like three scenarios: (1) remove everything with all events/etc, (2) remove all html stuff and store it somewhere (and I just assume that there are no events resp. take care of them individually, (3) remove all html stuff to be inserted at the same place again later while maintaining events...
[14:48:00] <g0th> so I guess I am mostly interested in (1) or (2)
[14:48:08] <g0th> unless (3) is easy
[14:50:12] <g0th> can a whole bunch of divs just be made invisible (no layout relevance at all)?
[14:50:34] <g0th> that would be the simplest solution for temporarily "disabling" them
[14:51:35] <g0th> but I am also interested how to really remove all html content with all event stuff etc
[14:52:28] <Eviltwin> g0th: That's a CSS question
[14:52:32] <Eviltwin> Look at the visibility property
[14:52:57] <g0th> yeah I guess the second last question is a css question
[14:53:34] <g0th> how do I remove all html content with all events etc?
[14:53:47] <g0th> I need to manually track the events?
[15:08:06] <g0th> hmm, can I remove a document fragment?
[15:08:15] <g0th> can I give an id to a document fragment?
[15:08:32] <g0th> I'm a bit confused because it is not part of the dom tree as far as i understood (but I don't understand too much)
[15:13:35] <Iceshifter_> >http://pastie.org/3467451
[15:14:01] <Iceshifter_> When creating a dynamically added element, shouldn't .bind() be used to attach the event listener to the element?
[15:14:12] <Iceshifter_> very new to JQ, so trying to figure this out :)
[15:15:32] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ Iceshifter_
[15:15:33] <bot-t> Iceshifter_, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[15:15:37] <Eviltwin> I suggest reading the resources there
[15:15:50] <Eviltwin> It's generally not a good idea to just dive in without some kind of foundation
[15:17:44] <WintermeW> hi ppl. does it exist a working, and still actively maintained jquery plugin to create editable selects ?
[15:18:05] <Eviltwin> Iceshifter_: The problem here is you're attempting to do the bind before you've added the content
[15:18:22] <Eviltwin> Iceshifter_: If you moved lines 7-9 to be between lines 4 and 5, it should work
[15:18:48] <Iceshifter_> So the binding has to occur after it's been added.
[15:18:54] <Eviltwin> WintermeW: Editable how? Like full add/remove
[15:19:06] <Eviltwin> Iceshifter_: In order to bind to an element, the element needs to exist
[15:19:29] <Eviltwin> Sorry, gotta run
[15:19:35] <Iceshifter_> Got it, thanks
[15:23:55] <WintermeW> Eviltwin: i want a mix between an input box and a select, so the user can be able to either select an option or fill his own value
[15:26:13] <g0th> hmm, put all my elements in one containing element el, then I did: el.display=none; but I still see almost everything, is there no way to make all childs of the parent element as if they weren't there (for displaying purposes)?
[15:29:41] <muieeeeeeee> hi tehre
[15:29:44] <muieeeeeeee> i need some help
[15:29:49] <muieeeeeeee> is anyone online

[15:29:56] <imsky> available
[15:29:58] <muieeeeeeee> and able to help me with some sttuff
[15:30:23] <g0th> hmm I guess I could use jquery to affect all children elements
[15:30:28] <jks222222> " Just ask! "
[15:30:32] <imsky> ?ask
[15:30:32] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:30:39] <g0th> but the "display" property is already used by some parts
[15:30:54] <imsky> g0th: wut
[15:31:04] <g0th> so if I set display=none for all, what do I set it to when I want to reset to the situation at the beginning?
[15:31:17] <imsky> ?
[15:31:29] <g0th> imsky: < g0th> hmm, put all my elements in one containing element el, then I did: el.display=none; but I still see almost everything, is there no way to make all childs of the parent element as if they weren't there (for displaying purposes)?
[15:31:56] <imsky> sounds like you're doing it wrong
[15:31:59] <imsky> got a live example?
[15:32:19] <g0th> how will that help?
[15:32:20] <g0th> hmm
[15:32:28] <g0th> github.com/jjermann/rgf
[15:32:34] <imsky> err
[15:32:38] <g0th> I didn't commit yet though
[15:32:39] <imsky> i meant a fiddle maybe
[15:33:19] <zweb> I am looking for a way to "turn off" the ability to edit certain inputs. The application is currently working exactly as intended filling some data in from database included in POST request. Can I make inputs that match some selector uneditable?
[15:33:31] <imsky> ?g disabled input attribute @ zweb
[15:33:32] <ibodi> coldhead:  <div class='invisible'><video>...</div> i found when div is invisible, the video will play when it is triggered visible, which is good,  what about an image ? also not loading ?
[15:33:33] <bot-t> zweb, HTML input disabled Attribute - http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_disabled.asp
[15:33:39] <zweb> thank you
[15:33:41] <imsky> lol bot-t you glorious failure
[15:34:02] <zweb> what do you mean by ?g
[15:34:10] <zweb> oh is that channel syntax?
[15:34:12] <g0th> el=document.createElement("div"); el2=document.createElement(); el2.display=none; el.appendChild(el2); el3=document.createElement(); el.appendChild(el3); el.display=none; <- but stuff is still visible
[15:34:13] <imsky> yes
[15:34:23] <imsky> g0th: god that's ugly. you're in #jquery, use it
[15:34:37] <g0th> oeh for what?
[15:34:45] <zweb> very cool, how can I get bot docs?
[15:34:50] <zweb> or commands
[15:34:53] <imsky> zweb: talk to bot-t
[15:35:06] <g0th> the other elements should be div too
[15:35:12] <g0th> I just tried to give a skeleton example
[15:35:34] <imsky> lol
[15:35:41] <imsky> you mean $("<div />").hide()
[15:35:45] <imsky> yeah your version is cleaner
[15:35:56] <g0th> what?
[15:36:06] <imsky> idk my bff jill?
[15:36:12] <g0th> you just replaced the last command by something else
[15:36:20] <imsky> do you know where you are
[15:36:24] <imsky> http://www.jquery.com
[15:36:34] <g0th> yes
[15:36:35] <imsky> amazing new library, 5 years old
[15:36:55] <g0th> hide doesn't make the stuff vannish or does it?
[15:36:58] <imsky> yes.
[15:37:00] <imsky> ?hide
[15:37:00] <bot-t> .hide(): Hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[15:37:08] <g0th> ah so it is not for .hide?
[15:37:12] <g0th> el.hide
[15:37:13] <imsky> lol what
[15:37:18] <imsky> you're one crazy bastard
[15:37:27] <g0th> it is not about the css hide property?
[15:37:40] <imsky> there's no hide property
[15:37:46] <imsky> there's display and visibility
[15:37:59] <g0th> hidden
[15:38:18] <g0th> .hide() sets display=none?
[15:38:20] <g0th> for all matches?
[15:38:22] <imsky> yes
[15:38:28] <imsky> you could just open the API link
[15:38:32] <g0th> that's exactly why I made my example above
[15:38:40] <g0th> how do I unhide it?
[15:38:45] <ibodi> when a tag display=hidden, will the content be loaded by default ?
[15:38:45] <imsky> $(el).show9)
[15:38:48] <imsky> $(el).show();
[15:39:18] <g0th> and that gives back waht display was before?
[15:39:25] <imsky> no
[15:39:26] <g0th> so if display was "none" before it is "none" again?
[15:39:27] <imsky> that shows the element
[15:39:29] <imsky> no
[15:39:30] <imsky> that's toggle
[15:39:33] <imsky> ?toggle
[15:39:33] <bot-t> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[15:39:42] <imsky> err
[15:39:42] <g0th> I want to hide all
[15:39:46] <imsky> oh god wat
[15:39:49] <g0th> and then be able to get back to the original state
[15:40:10] <imsky> then use classes or something
[15:40:39] <g0th> I use stuff from projects that I have no idea about
[15:40:44] <imsky> yeah i get that
[15:41:12] <g0th> so I cannot change the html stuff from them
[15:41:22] <imsky> you can add classes
[15:41:22] <g0th> so what do you mean by classes?
[15:41:25] <imsky> oh god
[15:41:27] <imsky> lol
[15:41:31] <imsky> ?addClass
[15:41:31] <bot-t> .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[15:41:37] <g0th> what's your problem?
[15:41:47] <imsky> why are you in jquery
[15:41:54] <g0th> this is a jquery question
[15:42:01] <g0th> and you are drawing the wrong conclusion all the time
[15:42:08] <imsky> ?
[15:42:08] <g0th> one example
[15:42:14] <g0th> I ask "what do you mean by classes"
[15:42:21] <g0th> this was not about the definition of "class" or how to change it
[15:42:33] <g0th> it was more a question what you meant by "use classes"
[15:42:35] <coldhead> as in the expression "stay classy, brooklyn"
[15:42:43] <imsky> i'm staying so classy
[15:42:46] <coldhead> "stay classy, olsen twins"
[15:42:56] <imsky> stay classy san diego
[15:42:59] <g0th> how does adding classes help me in any way?
[15:43:12] <Kit-10> stay classy {}
[15:43:18] <imsky> because you can add a temporary class to already visible items to know which ones you should hide on the round trip, g0th
[15:43:24] <coldhead> if something is broken you just go $(thing).toggleClass('broken fixed')
[15:43:29] <imsky> ^ that too
[15:43:48] <g0th> imsky: can you give a hint how to do that?
[15:43:52] <imsky> ok one sec
[15:44:31] <coldhead> god bless you, every one
[15:44:36] <imsky> and you coldhead
[15:44:40] <imsky> you cold godless swine
[15:45:09] <coldhead> you sound just like my mother
[15:45:21] <imsky> lol
[15:46:03] <g0th> imsky: you mean I should store the "old" display information for everything and then use that information to set display again later? But how do I do that? It is possible with classes?
[15:46:13] <g0th> hmm
[15:47:17] <g0th> is it not possible to make the parent element "as if it _and all its childrens_ were not there" without changing all the children?
[15:48:47] <imsky> g0th: http://jsfiddle.net/h9rLb/
[15:48:58] <coldhead> $(this).parent().find('*').toggle()
[15:49:03] <imsky> you devil
[15:49:13] <imsky> better yet
[15:49:20] <imsky> $(this).parents("*").find("*").toggle()
[15:49:33] <Kit-10> eww at find('*')
[15:49:57] <coldhead> sorry Kit-10
[15:50:01] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[15:50:04] <Kit-10> $(document.body).find('*').toggle();
[15:50:08] <imsky> lmao
[15:50:17] <imsky> ok buddy
[15:50:18] <Kit-10> much cleaner that parents('*')
[15:50:24] <Kit-10> *than
[15:50:27] <imsky> we got a case of assburgers in the house
[15:50:50] <tw2113> don't consume the sauce
[15:51:54] <g0th> imsky: ok, that jsfiddle example looks like it might be useful for me :)
[15:52:06] <imsky> ok g0th take her away
[15:52:14] <g0th> thx
[15:59:18] <ibodi> coldhead: how's your first day of using jQuery , kid :D

[16:07:05] <a0> Queue question: If I am using .animate() on several different objects without specifying a queue name, and I do a .stop("fx",true) on one of them, does that clear all of the queued animations for all of those objects or just the one I call stop() on?
[16:09:41] <codepal> I'm working on some AJAX callback for wordpress
[16:10:03] <codepal> what's the best way to look at the content of those input .val()'s ?
[16:10:08] <codepal> use an alert() ?
[16:10:20] <Kit-10> console.log??
[16:10:26] <Kit-10> alert = nasty
[16:10:30] <a0> or just firebug
[16:10:49] <Kit-10> a0 console != firebug
[16:11:09] <a0> good point?
[16:11:17] <imsky> he got you there
[16:11:32] <Kit-10> who got who?
[16:11:37] <imsky> ERRBODY

[16:12:07] <WintermeW> got a problem with autocomplete(): i want the list to show right after the input acquired focus (it's a local, static list so it's ok). i did set minLength: 0 but nothing happens when the input gets the focus
[16:13:14] <diverdude> is it possible to upload js files and css files to jsfiddle?
[16:14:41] <a0> so I take it nobody here is knows the answer or is interested in helping me w/ my queue question?
[16:15:17] <ravenzz> diverdude no but you can include them
[16:15:37] <diverdude> ravenzz: yeah but need somewhere to upload them then hmm
[16:15:47] <tw2113> are they already on a server somewhere?
[16:15:51] <tw2113> just do an absolute url link
[16:17:57] <coldhead> Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind
[16:19:03] <imsky> you talking about me?
[16:19:31] <coldhead> a bit
[16:29:02] <beasty> mornings
[16:29:06] <beasty> anyone using jsdoc inhere ?
[16:29:38] <diverdude> hey guys. I have started creating a chatsystem frontend. So far i have only created the basic css and jquery code. What do you think of it? I made a jsfiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/2a66D/1/  (for some reason the icons i slapped up to imagebin are not being loaded by jsfiddle but chat-windows can be minimized/maximized by pressing the lightblue header)
[16:30:52] <beasty> facebook chat ?
[16:31:24] <diverdude> beasty: kinda
[16:31:38] <beasty> project or hobby ?
[16:31:47] <diverdude> beasty: hobby :)
[16:31:51] <beasty> mkay
[16:31:54] <Layla> i have a question can any one help me
[16:32:03] <beasty> diverdude: you have a linux background ?
[16:32:09] <diverdude> beasty: but if i make something good i might wanna use it in a project
[16:32:28] <Layla> i know to do a whois u do /whois but it dont show me what room they are in
[16:32:32] <diverdude> beasty: yeah...im no linux expert but i do use linux as my everyday system
[16:32:33] <Layla> how do i see that
[16:32:47] <beasty> diverdude: good look into ape ;)
[16:33:07] <diverdude> beasty: i already made a backend using websockets :)
[16:33:15] <diverdude> beasty: socket.io and a node.js server
[16:33:15] <beasty> oh ok
[16:33:37] <diverdude> beasty: i just need to merge the frontend and the backend now
[16:33:41] <beasty> ok
[16:34:28] <diverdude> beasty: not sure if my jquery code is high quality though...i dont think so since im still relatively new
[16:34:40] <beasty> i'm currently building a project with jquery + ape for a online quiz system
[16:35:24] <diverdude> beasty: ahh ok. did you investigate socket.io/node.js also as an alternative?
[16:35:32] <beasty> no
[16:35:36] <beasty> client wanted ape
[16:35:39] <diverdude> beasty: ahh ok
[16:35:46] <beasty> i don't argue with a client :)
[16:35:52] <beasty> oh damn
[16:35:57] <diverdude> beasty: totally understand hehe
[16:35:58] <beasty> need to get to sleep (:
[16:36:08] <beasty> s/get/go/
[16:36:33] <diverdude> beasty: why did you ask if i have linux background?
[16:36:49] <beasty> because installing ape requeres some technical stuff
[16:37:10] <diverdude> beasty: ahh right
[16:37:25] <diverdude> beasty: i did some of that stuff when setting up apache and HAProxy
[16:37:35] <diverdude> beasty: its not so difficult
[16:37:53] <beasty> (:
[16:37:55] <diverdude> beasty: making the config for HAProxy was quite though though
[16:38:02] <beasty> mm 1:37am
[16:38:21] <beasty> need to get back up around 5:45m
[16:38:24] <beasty> *am
[16:38:32] <beasty> that's going to be very painfull
[16:38:58] <diverdude> lol
[16:39:01] <diverdude> why so early
[16:42:04] <beasty> work :)
[16:42:14] <beasty> and to avoid traffic
[16:45:24] <LekeFly> Does lazy load work inside modal?
[16:46:24] <LekeFly> Oh.. i can use something like a click event..
[16:52:28] <rknLA> can anyone tell me how to add Accept: application/json to a $.ajax() request?  using accepts: in the settings doesn't appear to be working or well-documented
[17:00:40] <sroy2> hi, I want to use $("<div>", {class:"display"}) but can't because class is a reserved word, any advice how to get around this?
[17:03:01] <PhonicUK> sroy, use $("<div class="display"></div>") instead
[17:03:20] <StevenCodes22> sroy2:  ^^
[17:03:46] <PhonicUK> my turn, when trapping an error from .ajax, how do I get the return code instead of just the error text?
[17:03:48] <StevenCodes22> PhonicUK:  Isn't that used for slecting divs what will putting the div inside do ?
[17:03:55] <PhonicUK> so I can check for a 404/201/etc
[17:04:13] <sroy2> PhonicUK: if I use .append(x) will it still place x inside of the div?
[17:04:20] <PhonicUK> sroy2, yes
[17:04:22] <sroy2> ok
[17:04:38] <PhonicUK> $("<div></div>").append("<p>foo</p>");
[17:04:55] <PhonicUK> StevenCodes22, nope - selecting divs would be $("div"), putting markup inside $() generates the element
[17:07:05] <StevenCodes22> PhonicUK:  Wow, That is awesome is it safe ?
[17:07:33] <PhonicUK> reasonably, just make sure to use .text() for inserting text that is unsafe and you're good
[17:08:09] <PhonicUK> $("#listOfThings").append($("<li></li>").text("Hello World!"));
[17:08:16] <PhonicUK> assuming listOfThings is a ul
[17:08:54] <StevenCodes22> gotcha
[17:09:14] <StevenCodes22> PhonicUK:  Thanks, I just never seen anyone do that before
[17:09:45] <znf> Hello.
[17:10:27] <znf> I'm trying to create some simple tabs with the supplied code on http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/ but what I'm testing doesn't really seem to be working
[17:11:34] <znf> I'm loading https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.16/jquery-ui.min.js <-- should I need to load separate components?
[17:11:59] <StevenCodes22> znf:  did you load jquery right before it ?
[17:12:09] <znf> StevenCodes22, yes
[17:12:17] <StevenCodes22> znf  should be good
[17:12:19] <znf> http://z.linge-ma.ws/jmon/#
[17:12:25] <StevenCodes22> znf:  checking
[17:12:48] <StevenCodes22>  znf Mind for a PM ?
[17:12:59] <znf> go ahead, please
[17:17:28] <myndzi> i've got some code throwing an error 'cannot call method 'call' of undefined'; it appears to result from $(".chart").each()
[17:17:49] <myndzi> i wrote: $(".chart").each(function(keke){console.log(keke);}); in the console
[17:17:58] <myndzi> and it echos a 0 and the div with class='chart'
[17:18:05] <myndzi> why the 0? what's wrong here?
[17:19:22] <wjp1234> 0 is the index of the div element
[17:21:03] <myndzi> shouldn't .each call the function in question on .. each div, not each index and each div?
[17:21:12] <myndzi> or perhaps the root error is something else
[17:21:24] <myndzi> it's kind of hard to figure out wtf is going on in jquery code
[17:23:21] <myndzi> ahh, i figured it out ;)
[17:23:34] <myndzi> incomplete edits due to a crash; the function it was calling doesn't exist apparently haha
[17:24:09] <myndzi> right, i was trying to put the function into a namespace i could access
[17:29:30] <wjp1234> myndiz, use firebug, it has a decent debugger
[17:29:57] <StevenCodes22> wjp1234:  I think firebug revolutionized css
[17:30:13] <wjp1234> Yes!
[17:30:36] <StevenCodes22> :)
[17:34:28] <nobitanobi> How do I trigger the anchor onchange in this case: http://jsfiddle.net/ku2eg/1/
[17:38:25] <wjp1234> nobitanobi, that code should handle the select's onchange not the anchor.  I'm not sure anchor has an onchange handler
[17:38:50] <djsounds02> http://kubeonedesign.co.uk/petfood/health-problems/
[17:39:03] <djsounds02> on this link I have slideToggle

[17:41:44] <wjp1234> Anal glands? Interesting page...
[17:42:12] <djsounds02> hahaha
[17:42:12] <coldhead> D :<
[17:42:16] <nobitanobi> wjp1234: how can I do that then?
[17:42:54] <StevenCodes22> coldhead:  How's your day going ?
[17:43:11] <coldhead> can't complain
[17:43:12] <wjp1234> nobitanobi, I think anchor only traps onclick.  It should ignore onchange.
[17:43:15] <coldhead> lunch is immanent
[17:43:27] <djsounds02> wjp1234: do you need to see my source?
[17:43:41] <djsounds02> or can you see everything fine
[17:46:50] <Ukto> i am using jquery tabs, and have about 3 on the left hand side... is there a way to set the 3rd to basically float right?
[17:51:09] <djsounds02> ?
[17:52:16] <aqeel> hi room
[18:15:17] <pzuraq> anyone here familiar with uniformjs?
[18:15:40] <pzuraq> I'm trying to reset a select button after changingthe select parameters
[18:17:47] <gogo_it> can someone help me debug this. my click event is not working http://pastie.org/3468326
[18:18:24] <gogo_it> I've spent 5 hours trying to figure this out http://pastie.org/3468326, but the click event does not seem to work.
[18:18:42] <pzuraq> hold on, working on something right now but I'll try to help out in a sex
[18:18:44] <pzuraq> sec*
[18:19:05] <gogo_it> pzuraq: thanks
[18:19:12] <josh9> how to replace 1 image with another using a fading effect?
[18:20:26] <aqeel> use replace with fade
[18:24:24] <pzuraq> ok fuck it
[18:24:28] <josh9> aqeel: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1792610/adding-fade-to-jquery-image-replacement  ?
[18:24:28] <pzuraq> uniformjs is bs
[18:24:38] <pzuraq> gogo_it: whats your problem?
[18:25:06] <gogo_it> my click event is not working. I pasted the jquery.  I can not figure it out
[18:25:32] <gogo_it> when I click the #clickme item, it does nothing
[18:26:06] <gogo_it> I do know the toggle works, b/c I can the code in the console
[18:26:08] <pzuraq> why does slideToggle have a function in it?
[18:27:18] <aqeel> yes u can use that
[18:27:36] <gogo_it> Not sure, I copied it from the jquery-ui site, I'm new to this
[18:27:42] <pzuraq> mmk
[18:27:57] <gogo_it> mmk?
[18:28:00] <pzuraq> try getting rid of that function if it doesn't do anything, I'm pretty sure its unnecesarry
[18:29:00] <gogo_it> removed it
[18:29:04] <pzuraq> same?
[18:29:06] <gogo_it> still not working
[18:29:12] <pzuraq> kk
[18:29:20] <gogo_it> kk?
[18:29:41] <gogo_it> when I run the code by it's self, it works, but with the other code it does not
[18:30:13] <pzuraq> yeah, but I'm not seeing why myself. I find that JS can be weird, in that something you would not expect to break it can totally break it.
[18:30:51] <pzuraq> #ask is on the page yes?
[18:31:07] <y3di> is .hover() depecrated?
[18:31:12] <y3di> should i just be using on()
[18:31:34] <gogo_it> yes
[18:31:46] <gogo_it> if I run $('#clickme').click(function() {
[18:31:46] <gogo_it> 	  $('#ask').slideToggle('slow');
[18:31:46] <gogo_it> 	}); in the console it works
[18:32:06] <gogo_it> oops! sorry for the multi lines
[18:32:12] <pzuraq> mmk, does the keyup function for #q work?
[18:32:24] <gogo_it> let me check
[18:33:19] <gogo_it> no, that's broken too now
[18:33:42] <pzuraq> try replacing the single quotation marks in $() with double quotes
[18:34:41] <y3di> how can i find a list of all the event handlers
[18:37:47] <pzuraq> gogo_it: no results?
[18:43:38] <gogo_it> Thanks for the help!
[18:43:45] <pzuraq> awesome!
[18:43:51] <pzuraq> glad to be of assistance! :)
[18:43:59] <gogo_it> seems like I just needed to close the browser and clear the cache
[18:44:10] <gogo_it> code was fine! ugh
[18:44:16] <StevenCodes22> What's a fun simple id to do with jquery hmmmm
[18:44:17] <gogo_it> it's always something simple
[18:44:38] <gogo_it> have a good night!
[19:04:32] <Whirl3d> Good evening, without starting a discussion about the relative worth/problems of having a "landing page", does anyone know how I could use jQuery to play a full window movie automatically on load and then switch to the "home" page once the movie is done?
[19:04:48] <symaxian> Does QUnit run tests asynchonously by default?
[19:05:34] <jrockjiggz> Whirl3d: I think this could cause a discussion about ethics
[19:05:48] <Whirl3d> Right. That's why the preface.
[19:06:35] <Whirl3d> My customer has a short animation that they want to display on load and after 3 years of regular debate, it has come down to "Do it or you're fired"
[19:06:49] <jrockjiggz> have you seen http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1055214/is-there-a-way-to-make-html5-video-fullscreen ?
[19:06:49] <aqeel> use flash
[19:06:59] <aqeel> with jquery
[19:07:32] <b0x> and voodoo
[19:07:53] <aqeel> but u can animate then load contents instead of fullscreen/
[19:08:04] <b0x> Whirl3d: performing tasks that your customer asks for generally helps in keeping your employment.
[19:08:18] <b0x> wish i could tell alot of my clients to stfu and eat a dick
[19:08:18] <Whirl3d> jrockjiggz, thanks for the reply. I'm not looking for a full-screen display as much as a relatively full-view portal display of the browser
[19:08:25] <b0x> however life doesnt work like that
[19:09:07] <b0x> youve got to pretend to be considerate and open to suggestion, you know, completely opposite to what web dev's usaully are
[19:09:17] <Whirl3d> It would have a skip button and a cached cookie would prevent the video from playing twice to the same  browser/pc
[19:10:15] <jrockjiggz> it seems flash has security in place to prevent fullscreen
[19:10:38] <Whirl3d> b0x, I have bent over backwards for these folks. I developed the site in AS2 for Flash and they loved it. Then iPad came out and they had me re-do the entire site in jquery. It's better now, but full-window video is still a problem.
[19:10:57] <Whirl3d> And even non-full-window autostart and stop has been problematic
[19:11:58] <jrockjiggz> are you having issues getting the video to play on ios?
[19:12:11] <Whirl3d> I'm currently using the video-for-eveyone method, but getting the video to start (even after an "enter" button is clicked") has been problematic
[19:12:57] <Whirl3d> Really, the problem is that I can 't find a way to make all browsers start a video and report when the video ends to redirect
[19:15:14] <jrockjiggz> Use a custom flash player that will trigger a js function after the video is done
[19:15:42] <jrockjiggz> as for auto starting, you can have it play in the viewport. but on IOS it will not play automatically
[19:16:05] <jrockjiggz> and ios wouldn't use flash.. just html5 video
[19:17:16] <aqeel> u know action script?
[19:17:30] <aqeel> flash has actionscript.....use with jquery...
[19:17:36] <Whirl3d> There's an enter button that triggers the animation. I need the video to pause on Frame 1 and then after clicking "enter" play this video:  http://youtu.be/-AOXpUQ-t0w
[19:18:03] <pzuraq> anyone familiar with uniformjs? I'm trying to get the update function to work, its being a little bitch right now.
[19:18:05] <Whirl3d> aqeel, that's what I have been trying. I am having problems identifying the end of the video
[19:18:18] <Whirl3d> btw, thanks guys for your help.
[19:21:43] <jrockjiggz> Whirl3d: find a flash video player with an api. use it to start video when the enter button is clicked. you might have to customize the player to trigger an event when the video is done.  sounds pretty easy.  you most likely won't be able to make the video full-screen unless the 'enter' button was built into the FLV flash video player, acting as a secret fullscreen/play button.   With the end of the video, you 
[19:25:25] <optraz> i have this " $('.background ul li a').click(function () { $('li ul').slideToggle('medium'); }); ", the issue is that i have a few ul , and so when i click on it, all the li ul is drop down, what i need to do so that the drop down only when the specified is click?
[19:25:56] <LeoJweda> can i use a tab bar without actually switching views when a tab is selected?
[19:26:21] <jrockjiggz> tab bar?
[19:27:17] <jrockjiggz> optraz: replace $('li ul') with:   $(this).closest('li>ul')
[19:28:13] <jrockjiggz> or.. $(this).parentsUntil('ul')
[19:29:39] <optraz> jrockjiggz: no, it doesn't work
[19:30:10] <jrockjiggz> try $(this).closest('ul')
[19:31:01] <optraz> no, neither
[19:33:53] <jrockjiggz> paste
[19:34:07] <jrockjiggz> ?p @ optraz
[19:34:07] <bot-t> optraz, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[19:34:29] <optraz> too long code, sorry , cannot paste
[19:35:03] <steve0hh> @optraz http://pastebin.com/
[19:35:08] <StevenCodes22> optraz:  Then paste where the error is
[19:35:22] <jrockjiggz> really your problem is $('li ul'). that is a query across the dom and is grabbing every single <li>.. you need to narrow it down or make relevant to the item being clicked
[19:35:45] <jrockjiggz> sorry, UL inside LI
[19:36:32] <optraz> jrockjiggz: okay, will try thanks
[19:45:23] <optraz> jrockjiggz: closest is travelling up the tree, how about travelling down the tree?
[19:46:49] <pzuraq> is there any way to test whether or not a .change is being called?
[19:56:35] <LeoJweda> can i use a tab bar without actually switching views when a tab is selected?
[19:56:35] <LeoJweda> 03:26jrockjiggz:
[19:56:35] <LeoJweda> tab bar?
[19:56:42] <LeoJweda> whoops
[19:56:53] <jrockjiggz> didn't know what you meant by tab bar
[19:57:03] <jrockjiggz> optraz: closest will travel down aswell
[19:57:06] <LeoJweda> jrist-wknd: jqueryui
[19:58:05] <LeoJweda> jrockjiggz: jqueryui
[20:00:01] <jrockjiggz> LeoJweda: I don't understand why/how you want to select a tab but not have it selected?
[20:00:04] <optraz> jrockjiggz: $('li ul', $this).slideToggle('medium'); <== is the $this is allow in this context?
[20:00:28] <jrockjiggz> optraz: try just this (no $)
[20:00:50] <optraz> jrockjiggz: nope, dont work etiehr
[20:01:03] <LeoJweda> jrockjiggz: i just want to use it as an interface and a data selector not for navigation
[20:03:27] <jrockjiggz> not sure if this is how.. maybe $('.tabs').tabs({ select: function(event, ui){ $(this).stopPropagation() });
[20:04:43] <LeoJweda> jrockjiggz: that should be a good start, i'll give that a shot, thanks :)

[20:12:33] <litwol> I am building a JS app which requires jquery and several jquery's modules. I am planning to use LABjs to load these libraries (and my own app code) onto a page wherever my library is being used. the issue i am having difficulty undersanding is what happens when i try to load own jquery.js resource onto a page that already has jquery. Is there a way for me to contain  newly loaded jquery file into anon function or something? to avoid overriding gl
[20:13:31] <litwol> I suppose a betteer question is: What is an appropriate way to handle such scenario?
[20:15:46] <litwol> oh
[20:15:47] <litwol> hold on
[20:15:54] <litwol> i think i just realized answer to my own question
[20:16:38] <litwol> $LAB.script("my.jquery.version.js").wait(function(){ myJquery = jQuery.noConflict()});
[20:16:41] <litwol> i wonder...
[20:16:44] <litwol> hrm
[20:17:15] <litwol> need to check $LAB whether it executes wait() anon function within context of downloaded file rather than global
[20:17:50] <jrockjiggz> litwol: if you load a new jquery.js again, it will replace the $ object.  if you want to preserve a preview version, you must assign it like: var $$$ = $.noConflict();  then load your new jquery.js
[20:18:11] <jrockjiggz> jQuery.noConflict() yea
[20:18:25] <jrockjiggz> preview = previous
[20:18:51] <litwol> i write my js apps inside (function(window, $){ /* here */})(window, jQuery);, so i get no conflicts with $ ;)
[20:19:02] <jrockjiggz> optraz: cool, i rarely use $('el', this). i don't fully understand that hah
[20:19:15] <litwol> the problem is when i dynamically add new version of jquery.js to document.head
[20:19:42] <litwol> i'm not sure whether it will be executed in global variable space or how to force it to execute within my anon function scope
[20:19:52] <litwol> s/variable space/scope/
[20:20:40] <dnsdds> Is there a clean way to select an element and all of its descendants in one go?
[20:22:58] <jrockjiggz> dnsdds: $('div *') ?
[20:23:17] <jrockjiggz> but to include the parent DIV, i've seen a plugin for that..
[20:24:06] <dnsdds> jrockjiggz: Hmm... $("div").add("div *") ?
[20:25:07] <jrockjiggz> mybe.. or $('div').children().andSelf()
[20:26:04] <jrockjiggz> or $('div, div *')
[20:26:10] <dnsdds> jrockjiggz: Interesting... any difference in performance?
[20:27:01] <jrockjiggz> not really
[20:27:48] <dnsdds> Thanks a bunch!
[20:27:49] <dnsdds> I guess I'll do the .andSelf() version, since that only requires writing the parent selector once :)
[20:31:28] <jrockjiggz> np
[20:31:54] <felixqc> i've got a function taking two arguments... inside, i open a dialog. how can i access these arguments?
[20:33:41] <jamescarr_> hey, anyone know of a good combobox component?
[20:33:54] <jrockjiggz> felixqc: can u show an example?
[20:34:29] <jamescarr_> Basically looking for something like Ext.js Comboboxes
[20:36:42] <felixqc> jrockjiggz: http://pastebin.com/TrUWtxVz
[20:36:54] <felixqc> i want to be able to append the id to the ajax url
[20:37:21] <felixqc> {{ tags }} are twig tags... it outputs an url.. works fine
[20:38:38] <felixqc> jrockjiggz: i'm calling that with jQuery('<div></div>').globProdEditDia('Item 2',2);
[20:40:10] <litwol> $LAB.wait(function(){window.old$ = jQuery.noConflict();}).script("my-version-of-jquery.js", "my-app.js").wait(function(){my_app.init(window.jQuery); window.jQuery = window.old$});
[20:40:14] <litwol> how about that ?
[20:40:46] <litwol> save existing jquery before loading my own. run my own app init with passing new jquery into it. then restore old jquery.
[20:40:56] <jrockjiggz> felixqc: before this.dialog();  console.log(id).  if correct, try saving id as a var, and then use the var in the url string
[20:42:17] <Gonad> anyone notice an issue with animate on hover overs to change background position?
[20:42:29] <Gonad> http://pastebin.com/vbZJYQ7D <-- this animate does not work.  Anynoe have an idea why?
[20:42:32] <jrockjiggz> litwol: i'm pretty sure you cannot replace the jQuery object like that.. you'd have to reload the script
[20:42:56] <litwol> jrockjiggz: you mean restore it ?
[20:43:37] <jrockjiggz> Gonad: look at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5171080/jquery-animate-background-position
[20:44:53] <Gonad> looking
[20:44:59] <jrockjiggz> litwol: if you need to use a specific jquery version for a component, then saving as old$ is correct, and just call old$ in the component instead of using (jQuery)
[20:45:32] <litwol> jrockjiggz: old$ is what i want to preserve on the page... because i dont know where my app will be used.
[20:45:46] <litwol> jrockjiggz: but in my app i want to ensure i use jquery version that i very specificaly chosen
[20:46:14] <Gonad> jrockjiggz:that works! thx
[20:46:23] <Gonad> i was reading other articles which mentinoed to do it the way i had
[20:46:24] <litwol> that is why i am passing jQuery into my app instead of old$. because i am /assuming/ by dynamicaly loading new jquery file it /may/ replace global scope jQuery variable
[20:46:31] <jrockjiggz> Gonad: np :)
[20:46:51] <Gonad> wonder if it can do fade
[20:47:34] <felixqc> jrockjiggz: works now... with only url: id
[20:47:43] <felixqc> i add the route in the call
[20:48:08] <jrockjiggz> ok
[20:48:16] <jrockjiggz> cool :)
[20:48:25] <felixqc> but, now i have: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'dialog'
[20:48:48] <felixqc> it bugs on the this.dialog( "close" );
[20:49:21] <felixqc> line 25
[20:50:28] <jrockjiggz> litwol: maybe this might help? http://jsfiddle.net/YSqjP/
[20:51:03] <jamescarr_> damn
[20:51:09] <litwol> jrockjiggz: oh snap
[20:51:13] <litwol> jrockjiggz: ty ty! /me tries
[20:51:55] <felixqc> nice
[20:53:11] <felixqc> jrockjiggz: thank's for the hint, any idea how i can access my dialog from inside the ajax call?
[20:53:56] <jrockjiggz> hmmm
[20:53:57] <jamescarr> #javascript is invite only!?
[20:54:28] <Whirl3d> #javascript requires that you register your nick is all
[20:54:36] <jrockjiggz> would this.dialog() not work?
[20:55:01] <jrockjiggz> i guess not
[20:55:32] <felixqc> no, it doesn't
[20:55:40] <jrockjiggz> perhaps $(this).dialogue
[20:57:25] <optraz> is it possible to slide to the left or right?
[20:57:31] <optraz> i see in jquery, it can slide top or bottom
[20:57:46] <jamescarr> anyone know of a good combobox like the one used in ext.js? http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/ext-4.0.7-gpl/examples/form/combos.html
[21:00:35] <litwol> jrockjiggz: hey. i just tested it. works like a charm ($lab.wait(save old jquery).script(fetch new scripts).wait(init my app with new jquery, restore old jquery)
[21:00:38] <litwol> :-D
[21:00:43] <felixqc> jrockjiggz: no more errors with $(this)... but does nothing ;)
[21:00:48] <litwol> i'm going to go pat myself on the back for a few minutes.
[21:02:27] <jrockjiggz> jamescarr: i did a quick google, i found this one: http://www.jqwidgets.com/jquerylistbox/
[21:03:13] <jrockjiggz> lol good stuff
[21:03:36] <DragonLegion> so I have a problem with inputs that have an id associated with them.  If I pull the $('#id').val(); it always is undefined, same with $('#id').attr('value');, any fix for this for form validation?
[21:03:53] <jamescarr> they actually have a combobox widget, gonna try that
[21:04:21] <jamescarr> ah damn
[21:04:23] <jamescarr> dual licensed
[21:04:26] <jamescarr> frown
[21:04:55] <felixqc> jrockjiggz: works!
[21:05:06] <felixqc> i had to add: context: $(this) to my ajax
[21:05:15] <jrockjiggz> ohhh good call
[21:05:29] <litwol> jrockjiggz: the trick is to make sure above chain saves and restores both "jQuery" and "$" variables. because the use of both is so common. and in my test it seems both old $ and jQuery variables were automaticaly updated as soon as my jquery version was loaded on the page.
[21:05:34] <jrockjiggz> context... neat
[21:05:38] <felixqc> finally! this frigging form works
[21:05:50] <felixqc> jrockjiggz: want me to post the working code?
[21:06:01] <jrockjiggz> its ok
[21:06:12] <jrockjiggz> i know what u changed
[21:06:32] <aqeel> jquery ui have slide left/right
[21:07:07] <jrockjiggz> DragonLegion: $('#id').val() always works.. there must be something at play...
[21:07:58] <thedeeno> Is it expected that event.pageY is undefined in the droppable#drop callback?
[21:08:02] <DragonLegion> well the one I'm debugging atm the value isn't even instantiated (dynamic form) but it always triggers my if statement
[21:09:24] <jrockjiggz> felixqc: i never knew about context, thanks
[21:10:53] <DragonLegion> and I have it checking if $('#id').val() is undefined
[21:12:33] <jrockjiggz> DragonLegion: jQuery.val() and .text() will never return 'undefined' for an empty selection. It always returns an empty string (i.e. "").  undefined would be from the element not existing.  you should probably wrap your code: if( $('#id').length > 0 ){}
[21:13:00] <DragonLegion> that could work too, checking
[21:14:48] <imsky> jeggings
[21:14:58] <DragonLegion> yep, that works, thanks jrockjiggz

[21:26:35] <ckknight> ah, so yes, Terminator
[21:27:44] <aqeel> is teleportation time travel?
[21:27:56] <ScalaDepot> aqeel: No.
[21:28:21] <aqeel> well if you teleport and appear would not that be say even 1 sec difference?
[21:31:40] <aqeel> if you enter teleportation......would not u want to know when and where to exit.....and that is time travel...
[21:32:41] <felixqc> duh
[21:32:48] <ScalaDepot> aqeel: That is not a mission priority.
[21:33:01] <felixqc> browser keeps the data after the ajax call.. so when i resubmit the form, still the same value
[21:33:20] <aqeel> lol....well just question pop up....reading terminator
[21:34:01] <aqeel> where they terminator teleport and time travel into past

[21:49:36] <felixqc> browser keeps the data after the ajax call.. so when i resubmit the form, still the same value
[21:49:44] <felixqc> any idea how to clear that?
[21:52:14] <imsky> i heard reset() works well
[21:54:38] <spersaud> I want to be able to set the value of id_suggested_major_subregion and set it to not be editable  ..
[21:54:41] <spersaud> http://dpaste.org/UzFYI/
[21:57:55] <someprimetime> how can i remove a div that has a specific data-id on it?
[21:58:09] <someprimetime> like $('.js-remove-selected').data('id') where id = #?
[21:58:50] <DragonLegion> append a .remove() to it
[21:59:37] <someprimetime> well yeah, but how can i remove multiple of the same element with different ids?
[21:59:50] <imsky> what
[21:59:58] <someprimetime> if ($(this).data('id') == '#') { $(this).remove();} ?
[22:01:02] <imsky> ?g jquery data attribute selector

[22:01:14] <someprimetime> like say i have a bunch of <div data-id="#" class="js-remove-selected"> and i'm looping through all of them to get rid of them
[22:01:19] <someprimetime> but i want to do it one at a time
[22:01:22] <imsky> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[22:01:57] <tw2113> $('.js-remove-selected').each({ $(this).remove(); }); ?
[22:02:07] <tw2113> oops, missed the .data()
[22:02:23] <tw2113> $('.js-remove-selected').data('id').each({ $(this).remove(); }); ?
[22:02:52] <tw2113> that's my partially educated guess
[22:03:59] <glob> i'm unable to file a ticket for a jquery issue : Submission rejected as potential spam (Maximum number of posts per hour for this IP exceeded)
[22:04:28] <glob> i've never filed a ticket before, so i suspect there's a proxy between me and bugs.jquery.com
[22:04:39] <glob> is there any other mechanism to submit bugs?
[22:05:37] <glob> fwiw the bug report i'm trying to file is http://glob.pastebin.mozilla.org/1493335
[22:08:27] <glob> ah, after trying lots of times, it accepted the bug report
[22:19:32] <someprimetime> tw2113: yeah but is there a way to select by the attribute's value?
[22:19:42] <DragonLegion> find()
[22:20:03] <ndss56> someprimetime: .attr()
[22:24:19] <someprimetime> ndss56: how can i select a div with a class of '.foobar' and an attribute called 'data-id' with the value of 1?
[22:24:57] <ndss56> someprimetime: can u provide a jsfiddle of it?
[22:25:05] <someprimetime> sure one sec
[22:25:42] <ndss56> someprimetime: $('.foobar').attr('data-id');
[22:26:10] <DragonLegion> but if there are more of them?
[22:26:23] <LukeNukem> do i need to use jquery to submit a form without a submit button
[22:26:24] <someprimetime> ndss56: but how can i select one whose data-id = X
[22:26:26] <LukeNukem> using enter only

[22:33:56] <someprimetime> that works nicely
[22:34:09] <pif> 'this' is the element right?
[22:34:52] <coldhead> it should be
[22:35:00] <coldhead> unless something terrible is happening
[22:35:07] <pif> then this.form should work
[22:35:22] <coldhead> oh look at you, knowing JS :)
[22:35:30] <pif> but not jq :)
[22:35:39] <coldhead> i only know jQ
[22:35:54] <pif> i started out with raw js
[22:46:36] <harpal> I had included jquery.ui.js file and I am accessing tabs widget. but its showing error tabs not found

[22:57:38] <sviatovigt> hi
[22:58:05] <Shazer[2]> If I have one element but I need multiple calls
[22:58:19] <Shazer[2]> for example, if I have 3 usernames in a a separate div
[22:58:23] <sviatovigt> if I call a function from an element in a page, how can I get the element that is calling?
[22:58:24] <Shazer[2]> and want to be able to make all of them draggable
[22:59:06] <Murugaratham> put each of the usernames in a div?
[22:59:30] <Shazer[2]> Murugaratham, I do.
[22:59:35] <Shazer[2]> Let me give an example.
[23:01:47] <sviatovigt> how can I change the scope of a variable?
[23:01:55] <merlin1978> how to scroll to the bottom for DataTables plugin?
[23:04:12] <Shazer[2]> Murugaratham: notice how you can only drag the first, http://jsfiddle.net/VNrkU/2/
[23:09:19] <Shazer[2]> Anybody know?
[23:10:01] <Murugaratham> check this out: https://github.com/someshwara/MultiDraggable
[23:11:46] <LukeNukem> Hello, can someone tell me how to grab the id of a div?
[23:12:06] <Cork> ?.attr @ LukeNukem
[23:12:07] <bot-t> LukeNukem, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[23:12:56] <beasty> morning
[23:12:59] <Shazer[2]> Will do Murugaratham.
[23:13:56] <LukeNukem> Cork, var idparts=(".status_update").attr("id");
[23:13:59] <beasty> i got this issue with an iphone ... when i have a <select> with a .change() listener
[23:14:05] <LukeNukem> will that tell jquery the id of status_update class
[23:14:15] <beasty> but when i change it it doesn't use the 'listener' till i press 'done'
[23:14:20] <beasty> anyway to work around this ?
[23:14:21] <Shazer[2]> Murugaratham, do I need to get that library then?
[23:14:33] <Cork> LukeNukem: if you add Â£ infront of (".status yes :)
[23:14:34] <Cork> opps
[23:14:36] <Cork> *$
[23:15:05] <LukeNukem> var idparts=$(".status_update").attr("id");
[23:15:08] <beasty> oh and morning Cork
[23:15:22] <Cork> morin' beasty
[23:17:04] <Cork> beasty: thats actaully expected
[23:17:14] <Cork> (sorry missed your question before)
[23:17:24] <beasty> Cork: ok
[23:17:34] <beasty> just got complains from a client about it
[23:17:35] <Cork> beasty: change on select elements triggers when they lose focus
[23:17:43] <Cork> (blur)
[23:17:47] <Shazer[2]> Murugaratham, didn't work.
[23:17:56] <beasty> Cork: i should use blur then ?
[23:18:55] <Cork> beasty: select.change(function() {  }).keypress(function() { var $self = $(this); setTimeout(function() { $self.change(); }, 0); });
[23:22:33] <beasty> Cork: ok hang on
[23:23:27] <Cork> beasty: you might have to add something similar for touch events
[23:25:21] <beasty> Cork: ?
[23:25:34] <LukeNukem> Cork, can you show me a working example of that because my code just breaks when i do that
[23:26:12] <Cork> beasty: that one is to fix keyboard changes to select boxes
[23:26:30] <Cork> beasty: never had to workaround this on mobiles so not sure what event to track
[23:27:18] <Cork> LukeNukem: could you make a testcase for your code at jsfiddle?
[23:27:26] <beasty> Cork: ok
[23:27:36] <beasty> not using jqmobile plugin btw
[23:27:56] <Cork> beasty: me nither :)
[23:30:57] <disappearedng> I am seeing that my function attached to document.ready is being called twice. Any ideas how to debug this?
[23:31:47] <Shazer[2]> How can I test when something happens in PHP, then test in jQuery if it happened?
[23:32:47] <Cork> Shazer[2]: you would have to echo the value into the page
[23:33:01] <Shazer[2]> o.O
[23:33:07] <Shazer[2]> I remember doing it a while ago, but I've forgotten how
[23:33:11] <Cork> either as a javascript variable, or actaully echoing the value into an if statement
[23:33:18] <LukeNukem> Cork, i dont have a code right now because im starting to work on it and this is the first thing i need to get done What im trying to achieve is on submit of a form, find out the id of a element with its class
[23:33:24] <Shazer[2]> Let's say I have a textbox Cork, and a submit button.
[23:33:36] <Shazer[2]> And I want to pass the text in the textbox to my javascript file when I press the submit button, how is that done?
[23:33:49] <Cork> Shazer[2]: <script> var value = "<?php echo the_value ?>"; </script>
[23:33:59] <Shazer[2]> Can I send it to an external file?
[23:34:08] <Cork> Shazer[2]: ajax
[23:34:34] <Shazer[2]> Cork, would you be able to give me an example?
[23:34:42] <Shazer[2]> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net. On there?
[23:34:50] <LukeNukem> Shazer[2], its pretty easy, look at ajax examples
[23:34:57] <LukeNukem> or .post
[23:35:23] <Cork> LukeNukem: http://jsfiddle.net/RCVq7/
[23:36:01] <Cork> Shazer[2]: ya, theres basic examples for things like that at api see ?.post
[23:36:01] <bot-t> Shazer[2], jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[23:39:48] <beasty> Cork: i found the answer :)
[23:40:02] <beasty> Cork: if interested http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5960731/strange-behavior-of-select-dropdowns-onchange-js-event-when-using-next-on-m
[23:42:22] <LukeNukem> Cork, im getting undefined :\
[23:42:33] <Cork> uh...
[23:42:37] <Cork> what browser?
[23:42:49] <Cork> LukeNukem: and do you mean on the testcase?
[23:43:19] <LukeNukem> nope not on the testcase
[23:43:19] <Cork> beasty: scary...
[23:43:22] <LukeNukem> Firefox
[23:43:39] <defendguin> anyone using jquery mobile here?
[23:43:40] <Cork> LukeNukem: what does $(selectr).length give you?
[23:44:04] <LukeNukem> ehh
[23:44:34] <Cork> LukeNukem: that means does your selector find the elements your looking for
[23:44:46] <LukeNukem> var idparts = $($selectr).length();
[23:44:53] <Cork> no
[23:44:56] <LukeNukem> $selectr as in ".status_update
[23:45:17] <Cork> console.log($(".status_update").length)
[23:46:17] <LukeNukem> can i do alert instead =p
[23:46:35] <Cork> sure
[23:46:42] <LukeNukem> gives me 0
[23:47:06] <Cork> (though you should learn to use console.log instead)
[23:47:17] <Cork> alerts arn't a good debug tool
[23:48:18] <LukeNukem> ok
[23:49:59] <LukeNukem> http://jsfiddle.net/RCVq7/2/
[23:50:08] <LukeNukem> that gives me 1, but on my pc it does not
[23:50:53] <Cork> LukeNukem: http://jsfiddle.net/RCVq7/4/ wfm
[23:51:17] <LukeNukem> oh lol
[23:51:28] <LukeNukem> i did not notice the class name was different lol
[23:51:29] <LukeNukem> sorry
[23:51:37] <Cork> :)
[23:53:30] <codepal> jQuery(document).ready(function() {  === is this valid?
[23:53:43] <Cork> yes
[23:53:46] <tw2113> you forgot the closing });
[23:53:57] <codepal> it doesn't seem to be running inline wordpress template....
[23:54:01] <Cork> or you could just do jQuery(function() {
[23:54:03] <Shazer[2]> I can't figure out $.post
[23:54:12] <Shazer[2]> Cork, can you give me an example/
[23:54:13] <Shazer[2]> ?*
[23:54:20] <LukeNukem> Shazer[2], you are submitting a form right?
[23:54:24] <Shazer[2]> Yes.
[23:54:26] <Shazer[2]> :)
[23:54:32] <LukeNukem> ok wait one second
[23:54:36] <Cork> ?.serialize
[23:54:37] <bot-t> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[23:54:53] <Cork> codepal: any console errors?
[23:55:03] <codepal> none
[23:55:06] <codepal> it's strange
[23:55:16] <codepal> cause I know it's not running
[23:55:28] <Cork> codepal: run your page through w3c validator
[23:55:35] <Shazer[2]> Alright LukeNukem.
[23:55:36] <Cork> sounds like its prob a parsing error
[23:55:37] <codepal> it'd be loading a bunch of AJAX into the page, otherwise
[23:56:11] <codepal> good suggestion, but it's local dev
[23:56:34] <Cork> codepal: so save it to a file and upload it to the validator
[23:56:39] <sayyestolife> Hello.

[23:59:29] <Cork> if thats what you want, then ya its valid
[23:59:36] <LukeNukem> sorry Shazer[2] sayyestolife it was set on mootools.. here ya go, this works ;] http://jsfiddle.net/ZKu3w/5/
