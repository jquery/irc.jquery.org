[00:44:17] <blast_hardcheese> ch3mical: Yeah. Missed a "var"
[01:10:45] <aghouseh> looking for a bit of ajax guidance if anyone is around. http://pastie.org/3268460
[01:11:52] <aghouseh> when i make this ajax call and call a function on the returned data, its acting very strangely. i can console.log(data) in the function and the object is correct. if i try to access an attribute of the object, it is undefined.
[01:13:27] <red_square> aghouseh can you console.log data and paste it
[01:14:09] <red_square> also you can just do success: formatPreviewPane
[01:14:20] <red_square> no need for the anon function
[01:14:37] <aghouseh> http://pastie.org/3268460
[01:14:44] <aghouseh> ah
[01:15:10] <someprimetime> uh oh oksushi in the house
[01:15:23] <aghouseh> hah
[01:15:25] <aghouseh> welp that fixed it
[01:15:29] <aghouseh> removing the anon function
[01:15:42] <aghouseh> wonder why that is
[01:16:17] <red_square> odd, I was just saying you some typing....not fixing it!!
[01:16:22] <red_square> saving^
[01:17:01] <aghouseh> yea thanks :)
[01:17:07] <red_square> haha, np
[01:17:21] <aghouseh> still trying to get my head around all of the way you can call jquery things
[01:17:21] <red_square> i'd like to know why that fixed it too
[01:17:35] <aghouseh> yeah
[01:18:31] <ShawnRisk> How come $("webform-component label.option").replaceWith( "Paragraph." ); doesn't work to replace the text?
[01:18:52] <red_square> ShawnRisk because its replacing the element
[01:18:59] <shesek> ShawnRisk, I think you're looking for .text()
[01:19:16] <shesek> what you're doing there is replacing the whole <label> element with a text node
[01:22:59] <ShawnRisk> okay I understand that.  Now when I use .webform-component label.option:lang(fr) that turns up nothing.
[01:28:15] <aghouseh> red_square: hah it broke again somehow?
[01:42:51] <someprimetime> in this plugin example: http://blogs.sitepointstatic.com/examples/tech/jquery-plugin/index.html why are the scripts being included after the content?
[01:43:00] <someprimetime> i can't seem to put it in the <head> which I'd prefer to
[01:54:22] <red_square> someprimetime its the right way to put scripts before closing body tag
[01:56:56] <someprimetime> according to what?
[01:56:57] <someprimetime> i
[01:57:14] <someprimetime> woops... i've seen other plugins able to be included in the head, but i'm curious why this one won't work if done that way
[01:58:50] <red_square> someprimetime http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html
[01:59:01] <red_square> putting js in the head was 1995
[01:59:24] <someprimetime> red_square: i've read that and i currently follow it for a site i'm working on.. but i mean my question is specific to that link
[01:59:33] <someprimetime> how come it's not working if you move the initialization scripts to the head?
[02:00:09] <someprimetime> it's my first pass at making an actual jquery plugin within its own namespace, so i was curious about that
[02:00:29] <red_square> did you put it after jquery
[02:00:34] <someprimetime> yes
[02:00:40] <red_square> and what didnt happen
[02:01:10] <red_square> in the console is $.reverseText a function
[02:01:55] <someprimetime> shit i know why
[02:02:07] <someprimetime> it's not contained within a document.ready function
[02:02:18] <someprimetime> $(function()  {}); wrapped around the initialization of it works
[02:02:21] <someprimetime> i'm tired.
[02:02:31] <red_square> plugins shouldnt have doc ready
[02:02:39] <red_square> or anything really
[02:02:52] <red_square> put scripts at bottom and you can forget about it
[03:08:08] <g0th> hi
[03:09:36] <g0th> I do $(".foo").click(function(e) { ... });
[03:09:49] <ravenzz> congrats
[03:10:30] <g0th> $(".bar").click should be the same as the previous one
[03:10:32] <g0th> how do I do that?
[03:10:50] <ravenzz> mh?
[03:11:03] <ravenzz> $('.foo, .bar').click(function(e) { ... });
[03:11:08] <ravenzz> do you mean this ^
[03:11:10] <ravenzz> ?
[03:11:43] <g0th> hmm, no!
[03:12:21] <ravenzz> so what do you mean?
[03:12:39] <g0th> lemme think
[03:13:48] <g0th> foo has a function assigned to it (to click)
[03:13:53] <g0th> that function takes a parameter e
[03:14:21] <g0th> I want to assign to bar a function with parameter e that calls the foo function with that parameter
[03:14:42] <g0th> is that exactly the same as your line before??
[03:14:59] <red_square> yes
[03:15:12] <g0th> sure?
[03:15:13] <g0th> ok
[03:15:16] <ravenzz> uhm yes it will select .foo and .bar and will execute the same function
[03:15:18] <ravenzz> on click
[03:15:30] <g0th> but the argument is the same?
[03:15:37] <red_square> how many foo and bars have u got
[03:15:46] <g0th> one each
[03:15:47] <ravenzz> if you need to pass other paramenters than the e (event) to the function, you should change it a bit
[03:15:47] <red_square> the arg is the click event
[03:16:34] <g0th> I would prefer to think of it as "bar" click => delegates to "foo" click
[03:16:45] <g0th> the way you suggest is more like making them "equal"
[03:16:49] <g0th> but I guess only the result matters
[03:16:54] <ravenzz> ah
[03:17:25] <ravenzz> so $('.bar').click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $('.foo').click(); }); ;?
[03:17:41] <g0th> preventDefault()?
[03:17:50] <ravenzz> yep
[03:17:57] <ravenzz> ?preventDefault @ g0th
[03:17:58] <bot-t> g0th, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[03:18:06] <g0th> and that is not the same as .foo .bar?
[03:18:18] <ravenzz> yep, indeed
[03:18:23] <g0th> what's the difference?
[03:18:42] <red_square> well the click on bar triggers a foo click
[03:20:13] <g0th> what if I leave out e.preventDefault()?
[03:20:45] <red_square> then the default action will occur - if it is an anchor the href will be followed
[03:21:03] <red_square> preventDefault stops the default action
[03:21:30] <g0th> is it the same as if I clicked on foo at the same position?
[03:21:36] <g0th> the final result?
[03:21:56] <red_square> dunno what your trying to do
[03:21:59] <g0th> the problem is that the z-dimension of one is higher
[03:22:05] <g0th> a have a seekbar
[03:22:09] <g0th> and a playbar on top of it
[03:22:21] <g0th> when the user clicks on the playbar it should click on the seekbar
[03:22:40] <g0th> e is used for the position information
[03:22:47] <g0th> i.e. to calculate the percentage
[03:23:47] <g0th> it is still not working :(
[03:26:49] <g0th> at the moment the following happens when I click "bar": "foo" is clicked with a "wrong" parameter, and "foo" is clicked again with the "right" parameter...
[03:28:08] <g0th> oh!
[03:28:12] <g0th> "bar" is a member of "foo"
[03:28:15] <g0th> that changes things a bit ^^
[03:29:25] <g0th> <div class="jp-seek-bar"><div class="jp-play-bar"></div></div>
[03:29:38] <g0th> <div class="foo"><div class="bar"></div></div>
[03:30:03] <red_square> so the click will propogate
[03:30:11] <g0th> hmm?
[03:30:29] <red_square> a click on bar, foo will also recieve the event
[03:30:49] <red_square> unless you do e.stopPropagation
[03:31:07] <g0th> in my settings
[03:31:12] <g0th> what is the correct thing to do?
[03:31:42] <g0th> bar is a member of foo for displaying reason, anyway, I have to leave this hierarchy as it is
[03:31:48] <g0th> but in the code?
[03:32:00] <g0th> what comes first? foo.click or bar.click btw?
[03:32:17] <g0th> because the first has the wrong parameters
[03:32:20] <red_square> well if you click in bar, bar click
[03:32:27] <red_square> then foo if that is the parent
[03:32:42] <g0th> ok, I try again with just leaving "bar" untouched ^^
[03:32:51] <g0th> i.e. no click registration
[03:34:18] <g0th> wow!
[03:34:24] <g0th> this fixed like 5 bugs at the same time
[03:34:33] <g0th> thanks :)
[03:36:55] <red_square> cool
[04:13:50] <ravenzz> is there a better way to do this http://jsfiddle.net/5qst4/ ?

[05:07:46] <Engin> i need to get the actual size of an image (so that i can wisely scale and move it), i was using .load before getting them... and ignored the warnings in the doc :)
[05:07:52] <Engin> now it started to glitch
[05:08:07] <Engin> please tell me there's a rock solid way of getting image sizes :)
[05:11:34] <Noeble> question: I have a dropdown list which I trigger when I click an option.. when I click I make a getJSON request and back I get result that I append to a container. This works fine, however in each loop I need to make a new request.. and this is where I cannot get it to work. I need this value for each loop to verify something.. the result is a boolean. Check line: 33-38 http://dpaste.com/694333/
[05:15:45] <sodhi> Hi folks! I'm looking to add some placeholder text (yes, I'm fully aware of the placeholder attribute in html5) to a password input field. I'm basically using the focus/blur & 2 fields (one text, one password that defaults to display: none). This is all fine and dandy, however, when I remove focus from the password field (i.e. want to hide the proper password input field and show the fake text
[05:15:45] <sodhi> one) it still 'saves' my password. I can solve this by simply adding a $(selector).val(''), however doing that renders my password box unable to use a login button (as it loses focus, and removes the value of the password). Any ideas to solve this?
[05:19:22] <red_square> Noeble it makes no sense to do so many calls, why not pull down everything in one hit
[05:20:32] <Noeble> red_square: solved it now with an ordinary $.get.
[05:20:56] <Noeble> red_square: well, I do not have the nessesary information in the first reuqest to this this kind of information
[05:22:26] <red_square> Noeble you do
[05:23:19] <Noeble> red_square: perhaps I could remake loop through the list in the first request before I return it and include rest of the info
[05:23:49] <red_square> doing multi ajax hits in a loop will bite you quickly
[05:25:34] <Noeble> red_square: true, however I skiped the second ajax request and just made a get.. the only thing that the second request returns is a true or false.. shouldent slow it down to much
[05:30:37] <brianfreud> Really dumb question...  Why does 'foo'.jq() log an array ['f','o','o'] to the console here?  String.prototype.jq = function _String_jq () { return (this instanceof jQuery) ? this : jQuery(this); }
[05:31:14] * brianfreud would expect e.fn.e.init[0] instead
[06:00:48] <bonhoffer> i'm in a bind -- i want to put content in a region that a tab leads to
[06:01:25] <bonhoffer> but the content needs to exist when the dom loads, but i hide the div to get the tabs to work
[06:01:51] <bonhoffer> i am putting a calendar in a div that has display:none; and the calender needs a div to draw
[06:02:23] <bonhoffer> maybe i'll just put the calendar in a different page and have the tabs call the page
[06:02:25] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/Fhedt/4/ - how do I stop the dropdown menu from disappearing, say when you move your mouse from "NEW" to "CATEGORY A"?

[06:23:33] <nicholasschulz> Why don't this div shake? http://jsfiddle.net/nicholasschulz/KKRQC/

[06:24:02] <nicholasschulz> http://jsfiddle.net/nicholasschulz/KKRQC/1/
[06:35:14] <bjensen> I have two select boxes. When a user selects a value in the first then the allowed values of the other change..Can anyone please point me in the right direction as to how I can make this happen? A blogpost or plugin would be awesome
[06:35:20] <nicholasschulz> Got it figured out. worked with UI 1.8.16
[06:36:07] <nicholasschulz> bjensen: when you change the first one -> load the second one (again)..
[06:36:24] <bjensen> nicholasschulz: right but I prefer not having to contact the server
[06:37:15] <nicholasschulz> So the options list is not dynamic?
[06:37:48] <bjensen> nicholasschulz: it is, both ways.
[06:38:48] <nicholasschulz> Ooookay. I would go for the contact server,, that way the list is always up-to-date. Thats the only method I use so I don't know for sure how to do this without load
[06:39:21] <bjensen> nicholasschulz: so if I choose 'Bob' in the first select then the other should show Bobs projects. Alternative if I choose project  Boom in the last select then the first select should show me the participants on the Boom project.
[06:39:40] <bjensen> nicholasschulz: Neither do I, hence my question here :-)
[06:41:06] <nicholasschulz> Really, I think what you're looking for is a dynamic options list that is in contact with a database.. What if theres a new project? Are you going to change the html? Better to just add it into the database and everything else is done automatically
[06:41:32] <bjensen> There is no new project no
[06:42:23] <nicholasschulz> Ok. Well, then I don't know the best way to go about this problem
[06:48:01] <nicholasschulz> I use this as a href for JS : <script src='http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js'></script> Is this not  >= UI 1.8.16
[06:48:02] <nicholasschulz> ?
[06:50:09] <keybo> my computer crashed while i was working on a php file in notepad++ now i've reopened it and all it says is NULNULNUL in one long line all the wya down the page can anyone tell me if its possible to restore the file?
[06:52:16] <nicholasschulz> Its highly unlikely unless the file have been there for a while and you spend some money on a recovery tool @ keybo
[06:55:36] <robin_sz> keybo,  this is why they invented backups
[06:57:21] <robin_sz> clearly, the file was unimportant .. if it was important, you would have a backup
[07:25:20] <lduros> is it possible to use wildcards with  .data()?
[07:25:35] <lduros> like: $('.my-class').data('special-*')
[07:25:59] <lduros> and it would select data-special-case-1 or data-special-case-2
[07:26:01] <lduros> for instance
[07:26:06] <DukeDrake> would be awesome... but I doubt it, though I really don't know
[07:26:16] <lduros> hmm, best way is probably to test :-)
[07:27:25] <pifantastic> lduros: perhaps $('.my-class[data*="special"]');
[07:27:43] <shesek> I don't think it exists
[07:27:48] <shesek> pretty sure it doesn't
[07:27:54] <lduros> pifantastic: hmm maybe
[07:27:58] <lduros> shesek: which?
[07:28:11] <lduros> shesek: my example or shesek's?
[07:28:28] <lduros> shesek: s/shesek/pifantastic
[07:28:29] <shesek> using * as wildcard for attribute names
[07:28:48] <lduros> hmm sucks, I would have to make tons of for loops then
[07:28:55] <shesek> not for selectors and not for the data() function
[07:28:59] <lduros> ok
[07:29:12] <lduros> or maybe I'll use another technique
[07:29:12] <shesek> lduros, you can add your own function to selectors
[07:29:20] <shesek> or create your own $.fn function
[07:29:36] <pifantastic> lduros: what is setting the data in the first place?
[07:29:41] <lduros> shesek: right, do you know where I can get more info about that? I can google
[07:29:55] <lduros> pifantastic: it's a Firefox addon, and the data-blah are actually hardcoded into the page
[07:30:02] <pifantastic> ah
[07:30:02] <lduros> so it's parto f the dom
[07:30:03] <pifantastic> then yes
[07:30:05] <pifantastic> you're gold
[07:30:07] <shesek> lduros, about adding $.fn functions / selector functions?
[07:30:23] <pifantastic> lduros: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[07:30:27] <lduros> shesek: yes
[07:30:31] <lduros> pifantastic: thanks for the link
[07:30:34] <pifantastic> no, dont do that
[07:30:41] <pifantastic> just use an attribute selector
[07:30:49] <lduros> pifantastic: the link you just send, don't do this one?
[07:31:08] <lduros> hmm
[07:31:12] <pifantastic> lduros: use the link I sent, don't write any $.fn functions
[07:31:13] <dzhus> my $.get("foo.js", cb) works but $.get("foo.json", cb) doesn't (callback not performed); file contents are the same â€” why?
[07:31:26] <dzhus> no errors reported
[07:31:28] <lduros> pifantastic: but I don't need to check the value though
[07:31:37] <pifantastic> dzhus: $.getJSON
[07:31:46] <dzhus> pifantastic: no difference
[07:31:58] <lduros> pifantastic:  so just this is what I'd need: $('.my-class[data-special-*]'); :-) I'll check and see if it works :-)
[07:32:14] <pifantastic> lduros: even easier http://api.jquery.com/has-attribute-selector/
[07:32:35] <lduros> cool ok :-) -- thanks, pifantastic
[07:32:39] <lduros> shesek: thanks as wel
[07:33:00] <shesek> lduros, you can do $.expr[':'].wildcarddata = function() { /* return a boolean */ }
[07:33:16] <shesek> lduros, than $('.foobar:wildcarddata(xyz)')
[07:33:28] <lduros> shesek: looks like pifantastic is simple no?
[07:33:33] <shesek> and have that function test for a data attribute beginning with xyz
[07:33:42] <lduros> pifantastic's solution is simple, i meant
[07:33:57] <lduros> but thanks, I'll experiment and see how it goes :-)
[07:34:09] <shesek> hmm, I don't know what you need exactly
[07:34:36] <shesek> I don't see how the `has` pseudo selector would help you with what you described you need earlier, but I didn't read the whole conversation
[07:37:24] <Vorspire> jQuery causing fatal exception in IE: invalid argument "auto" - wtf - the calling code doesn't make use of any CSS or dimensional offsets for the element in question and this exception isn't raised in chrome or FF, just IE - and it destroys the page... any ideas?
[07:39:33] <red_square> maybe seeing some code would help Vorspire
[07:39:45] <red_square> whats the stack trace when it errors
[07:40:03] <Vorspire> think it's to do with the computed style
[07:40:22] <Vorspire> http://www.pandorauo.com/HighSeasBeta
[07:42:03] <red_square> so its when you set the iframe width to 100% i think
[07:42:34] <red_square> but using jquery full would help to debug rather than the min
[07:42:47] <Vorspire> I'm not using an IFrame for the News widget
[07:43:34] <red_square> the facebookLikeBox stuff
[07:44:17] <Vorspire> nah that all works, tested.. the .newswidget is the entire issue
[07:44:18] <Vorspire> as you can see I wrote an extensive piece of JS to load in PHPBB forum posts from any given forumID - it trims down the content and strips out post info then appends the content to the DOM - it works perfectly in chrome and FF, but not IE - wonder if it's to do with content being loaded but not included into the DOM
[07:45:06] <red_square> the bug is in the plugin 'overflow': 'auto'
[07:47:25] <raj> can someone tell me how to act on whenever this becomes true? $('#change_pic_box').is(':visible')
[07:47:47] <raj> give it a callback perhaps
[07:47:53] <red_square> u cant
[07:47:59] <raj> oh
[07:48:17] <Vorspire> yes you can, using a poller
[07:48:31] <Vorspire> check every 1000ms against your code
[07:48:31] <raj> k, got it, but no intrinsic method
[07:48:38] <Vorspire> no
[07:48:40] <raj> cool
[07:49:12] <red_square> Vorspire - mehhh
[07:49:19] <red_square> dont do that raj
[07:49:26] <Vorspire> I think I'm going to clip the wings of the IE devs soon, hopefully there won't be an IE 10 - abomination
[07:50:11] <keybo> can anyone tell me how to set the headers to json format when passing information back from the server?
[07:50:28] <Vorspire> red_square if you can think of a reason why he shouldn't use a poller, then explain :)
[07:50:28] <red_square> in what lang?
[07:50:43] <Thenior> hey all quick question, how do I select $(this) and another element at the same time?
[07:50:47] <red_square> Vorspire because it will kill his page doing that every second
[07:50:55] <red_square> ? liveQuery @ Vorspire
[07:50:56] <bot-t> Vorspire, livequery is the devil. stay away from its evil temptation
[07:51:04] <keybo> in php sorry
[07:51:19] <Thenior> I tried $(this+",.myElement") , no go
[07:51:24] <Vorspire> that's fine... conditional calling convention
[07:51:51] <red_square> keybo php not my bag but a quick google says header('Content-type: application/json');
[07:52:04] <Vorspire> liveQuery? why would that be needed?
[07:52:26] <red_square> Vorspire well, that plugin does what you suggested.....
[07:52:33] <red_square> scans the dom every x ms
[07:52:41] <red_square> and kills the page in the process
[07:52:58] <Vorspire> (Thenior): var elem = $(this).add("#someElem").end().andSelf();
[07:53:18] <Vorspire> red_square, that would be silly :)
[07:53:20] <keybo> its not mine really I just wondering where abouts in my php doc i set the header - just before passing the information back to the client?
[07:53:30] <Vorspire> shame the plugins website is down
[07:53:44] <red_square> a godsend, ost of them are kak
[07:54:09] <Vorspire> ?timerXAC
[07:54:10] <bot-t> Timer-X: Absolute Control - 1.0.4-VN-FINAL - An extensive timer plugin with a simple API which allows developers to easily add time-delayed controls to their projects with 2 simple functions: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/TimerXAC
[07:54:41] <Vorspire> ?jqeng
[07:54:42] <bot-t> English jQuery users may be offended by the accessor $, if offense occurs, change $ to £ and bang head on desk.
[07:56:35] <keybo> can anyone tell me if theres a way to set a header that will mean anything sent back will be in json format is what i'm asking i guess, rather than declaring the header before each time information is sent back
[07:57:31] <Vorspire> (red_square): so using that plugin, you can do: $("#someElem").timerDelayCall({ delay: 1000, repeat: true, interval: 1000, callback: function(timerX){ timerX.end().text(timerX.ticks); } });
[07:57:55] <red_square> Vorspire yak - why not just use native setInterval and save the bloat
[07:58:05] <red_square> it still scans the dom every 1000ms
[07:58:08] <raj> ok, when I show a dialog...or do any event...how can I emit something that I can use as a trigger?
[07:58:16] <Vorspire> because it blows up due to infinite looping?
[07:58:35] <raj> for something else to detect and act on
[07:58:50] <red_square> no because its so invasive to run something every x until y, if y doesnt happen then what!
[07:59:00] <raj> telling me?
[07:59:51] <Vorspire> (red_square): I don't think you quite understand heh, but OK - been using the plugin for years since I wrote it and it has no issues, it actually drives the clocks on the page i linked
[08:00:26] <red_square> Vorspire but why do I need a plugin
[08:00:33] <red_square> when there is a native timer in js
[08:01:00] <red_square> setInterval and setTimeout cover all needs
[08:01:01] <Vorspire> because the native timer will require you to write extensive work-arounds for repetition, which it doesn't nativeely support
[08:01:21] <Vorspire> yeah good luck looping it effectively without hitting a stack overflow
[08:01:23] <red_square> like what
[08:01:36] <red_square> there is clearInterval
[08:01:39] <red_square> to stop
[08:02:33] <red_square> but for recursion better use setTimeout and then use arguments callee
[08:02:49] <Vorspire> the plugin wraps the ntive methods and extends them, it offers like 50 options and can be attached directly to elements in the DOM - it uses all the timeOut native methods to achieve it and also offers profiling
[08:03:19] <Vorspire> profiling is a must have when polling
[08:04:33] <Vorspire> either way works though, but you still have to write a bunch of wrapping code around the native methods to achieve most goals, the plugin just means you don't have to :)
[08:05:53] <red_square> well I just see it as bloat, why do I need 50 options. I can imagine how many lines of code the plugin pulls in
[08:05:58] <red_square> when one would do
[08:06:56] <Vorspire> there isn't 50 options of course, but it's extensive, for example I use it to poll the jQuery tetris game I wrote, one ticking timer to handle sevral game eements each tick
[08:07:37] <Vorspire> wish the plugins site was up, the plugin has very detailed docs
[08:07:46] <red_square> not on github?
[08:08:52] <Vorspire> nah I don't use GitHub
[08:09:20] <Vorspire> I'm more for CodePlex - or hosting my own SVN repository
[08:10:21] <Vorspire> http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/JmKM4/
[08:23:02] <Vorspire> 	// Use this for any attribute in IE6/7
[08:23:02] <Vorspire> 	// This fixes almost every IE6/7 issue
[08:23:02] <Vorspire> 	nodeHook = jQuery.valHooks.button = {
[08:23:11] <Vorspire> yeah fixes.. bs.. breaks more like
[08:30:12] <techouse> so i got a div containing 2 child nodes already; i made a node in js and now want to insert it after the 1st child of the div and before the 2nd child of the div. how do i do that? append will send it to the end and prepend to the beginning
[08:31:41] <techouse> ah, .after & .before
[08:34:44] <pauls1> anyone know a good vector based activity indicator? i want to use this one but it looks like i can't really control the size of it to exact width / height. - i can only say how long each line is but not how big the center radius is http://neteye.github.com/activity-indicator.html
[08:35:16] <techouse> pauls1 gmm, spin.js?
[08:35:20] <techouse> hmm*
[08:35:31] <techouse> http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/
[08:35:31] <DukeDrake> re
[08:36:09] <pauls1> techouse: ah, awesome! thanks. dunno why this didn't come up in my search
[08:36:09] <DukeDrake> hmm ... anyone know why myelem.find('.myclass').show(); won't work in chrome, while it does work in FIrefox?
[08:38:20] <techouse> pauls1 beware though, it WON'T work in IE8 and lower
[08:38:33] <techouse> so for that use some animated gif or something
[08:38:39] <techouse> i'm just working on the issue myself :D
[08:39:04] <pauls1> techouse: tis a good warning.. but luckily i don't have to support browsers from the 80s :D was a decision i made early on in the project (http://blueprint.io)
[08:39:08] <techouse> & hitting problems since IE doesn't really work nicely with animated gifs
[08:39:21] <techouse> heh, lucky u
[08:39:32] <techouse> i gotta support browsers from ie7 upwards
[08:40:03] <pauls1> techouse: i feel your pain
[08:40:04] <techouse> pauls1 blueprint your site?
[08:40:16] <pauls1> techouse: yep i run blueprint
[08:40:31] <techouse> fap fap fap
[08:40:34] <techouse> looks nice
[08:40:40] <pauls1> hehe thanks :D
[08:40:40] <techouse> good business idea
[08:40:41] <techouse> :)
[08:40:59] <techouse> spotted a small error
[08:41:25] <techouse> when i like it (the fb app) and then press close on the popup it cuts away the lower white bar
[08:42:14] <pauls1> techouse: hm, what browser are you on? safari is working ok for me
[08:42:21] <pauls1> (and thanks for the like!)
[08:42:22] <techouse> crome
[08:42:23] <techouse> http://shrani.si/f/2k/jy/4QVzJI5c/errorblueprint.png
[08:42:32] <techouse> chrome 16
[08:42:35] <pauls1> wow that's interesting
[08:43:20] <pauls1> odd too, chrome on os x is working for me too
[08:43:27] <bonhoffer> i had a completely working js page, but i divided the page up into tabs so all the div's are display:none; by default now and my calendar doesn't show up
[08:43:28] <pauls1> maybe some windows-related rendering issue?
[08:43:34] <techouse> dunno
[08:43:47] <pauls1> i'll make a note about it though, thx mate
[08:43:50] <techouse> np
[08:44:00] <techouse> + i'm getting 5 js errors
[08:44:15] <bonhoffer> i'm considering: (1) changing the onclick event of the tab to generate the page or (2) and i-frame or (3) totally different pages since this can't be done
[08:44:18] <techouse> probably twitter and fb iframe related
[08:44:25] <pauls1> yeah that's probably what that is
[08:44:29] <pauls1> cause the site is https
[08:44:46] <pauls1> tried to solve it but don't know if there's anything i can do about it
[08:44:50] <bonhoffer> http://fitwit.herokuapp.com/base/camp_blog/4f047a88167294000100133e
[08:45:07] <techouse> pauls1 i'm getting the same crap on my http page
[08:45:15] <bonhoffer> the Grant Park Event Calendar Tab isn't working -- in fact it is silently failing with no console errors
[08:45:20] <techouse> probably browser specific
[08:46:11] <pauls1> techouse: ah ok. good to know
[08:46:13] <techouse> bonhoffer silent fail = check your network requests; might be some php part of an ajax failing
[08:46:26] <bonhoffer> techouse, good idea
[08:46:59] <techouse> that's usually what it is... do some var dumping on the php side...
[08:47:04] <bonhoffer> several graphics failing to respond . .
[08:47:15] <bonhoffer> and it is ruby -- but i could print to logs
[08:47:28] <techouse> ruby :/ jesus christ save us
[08:47:47] <bonhoffer> another option is to have the elements visible by default, then hide them when the tabs load
[08:47:51] <techouse> sry, don't know any ruby
[08:48:33] <techouse> but if you're using json, check these 3 things
[08:48:40] <bonhoffer> it's fun --but this has nothing to do with ruby in this case
[08:48:40] <techouse> which browser you're using
[08:48:46] <bonhoffer> chrome
[08:48:47] <techouse> how the json is sent
[08:48:51] <techouse> how the json is recieved
[08:49:37] <techouse> dunno, man, just pointing out some of the most obvious ajax silent fais
[08:49:44] <techouse> fails*
[08:52:10] <bonhoffer> techouse, very helpful, thanks
[08:52:20] <bonhoffer> i have a lot to learn with json troubleshooting
[08:52:48] <techouse> yea, i spent the past 2 days doing json toubleshooting with stupid browsers
[08:52:49] <crazydiamond> Hi. How can I add functions to be called at document.ready in multiple parts of the document?
[08:52:52] <techouse> like ie8 and down
[08:53:09] <techouse> figured one has to use json2.js for it :/
[08:53:15] <bonhoffer> techouse, :)
[08:53:18] <techouse> in ie8 and down
[08:56:18] <bonhoffer> is there a super easy way to show $(".tab_content") only if it's parent is an li of class ".current"
[08:57:08] <bonhoffer> i'm thinking of iterating through $(".tab_content").each and finding if tab_content.parent('li').class('current');
[08:57:19] <bonhoffer> but i'm suspecting wiser jquery folks have a better way
[08:57:52] <bonhoffer> i really want to hide all $(".tab_content") unless li has class "current"
[08:58:13] <crazydiamond> bonhoffer: shouldn't $("li.current > .tab_content") work?
[08:58:45] <bonhoffer> wow -- i forgot about css selectors . . nice
[08:59:03] <crazydiamond> :)
[09:01:16] <bonhoffer> oh, but the problem is that i didn't explain my setup well, i have <ul><li class="current"><a id="1">foo</a> . . . </ul>, then <div id="1">...</div>
[09:01:23] <bonhoffer> so i do think i need to iterate
[09:02:58] <bonhoffer> https://gist.github.com/1695032 <-- my js
[09:03:11] <crazydiamond> bonhoffer: but to iterate is not so bad way, then
[09:03:18] <bonhoffer> so i can modify that to hide unless parent has class "current"
[09:03:31] <bonhoffer> yes, but you reminded me of how elegant jQuery can be
[09:08:42] <dondani> is there a reason why people don't hang onto jquery-wrapped elements for the whole life of their plugins?
[09:09:06] <dondani> I don't usually see in the constructor: this.$element = $(element)
[09:09:25] <dondani> they keep repeating $(this.element) in the body of their methods
[09:16:06] <manador> quick question, trying to stopPropagation on all children except 1, can't get the syntax right
[09:16:25] <manador> $(".ch_popup_overlap_wrapper > *:not(.close)").click(function (e) {});
[09:16:51] <manador> that would mean all children of .ch_popup_overlap_wrapper, except .close
[09:17:12] <djQuery> ?stoppropogation@manador
[09:17:13] <bot-t> manador, event.stopPropagation() - This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[09:17:44] <djQuery> manador: so inside your function(e){e.stopPropogation(); rest of code}
[09:18:46] <manador> right, I didn't want to paste all that. See this: http://jsbin.com/ajakiq/2/edit#javascript
[09:19:09] <manador> I should have been clear :)
[09:20:05] <manador> that part works, I just can't get it to NOT apply to the child .close
[09:20:34] <manador> tried .children(':not(.close)') too
[09:21:11] <djQuery> then just do as jquery ui does and throw a span with an X in it and only attach the click to the span
[09:22:48] <Vorspire> what about .children.filter( function(){ return $(this).not('.close'); }).someOtherFunction();
[09:24:09] <manador> would that be children().filter... ?
[09:24:12] <dondani> is there a reason why people don't hang onto jquery-wrapped elements for the whole life of their plugins?
[09:24:21] <dondani> I don't usually see in the constructor: this.$element = $(element)
[09:24:27] <dondani> they keep repeating $(this.element) in the body of their methods
[09:24:35] <Vorspire> yeah, typo
[09:24:45] <Vorspire> and .net('.close').length
[09:24:49] <Vorspire> .not*
[09:25:00] <djQuery> ic could just be .children(function(){})
[09:25:16] <djQuery> doesnt .children accept a function to do the filtering
[09:25:26] <phdjsep> Hopefully someone can help. Here's a very simple js http://jsfiddle.net/bfQ3D/ I can't make this work in Coda however. I just want a single page html doc. I'm calling the latest jquery in the head and placing the js in script tags also in the head. Then the html in the body, but not working
[09:25:30] <Vorspire> yes that's true, it does :)
[09:25:53] <Vorspire> ?children
[09:25:54] <bot-t> .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[09:26:20] <Vorspire> ahh no djQuery, only selector support, no anon func
[09:26:33] <TL> phdjsep: This might sound crazy but try restarting Coda. Sometimes I have issues where it won't render something unless I restart the app
[09:26:47] <manador> djQuery: what I have is a full screen popup, trying to make it so that when you click outside the popup (.ch_popup_overlap_wrapper), it closes the popup. But I don't want to apply that effect to the children of the popup. However, one of those children is the close button, which I don't want to bind the stopPropagation() too
[09:27:01] <phdjsep> TL: I'll give that a shot
[09:27:15] <manador> that way, you can close the popup by clicking outside of, as well as by clicking the close button
[09:27:50] <manador> Vorspire:     $(".ch_popup_overlap_wrapper").children().filter( function(){ return $(this).not('.close').length; }) doesn't appear to work
[09:27:53] <djQuery> cant you investigate the e to find the source elemet that was clicked and check the class in the funciton
[09:28:04] <djQuery> ?clickelsewhere
[09:28:05] <bot-t> djQuery, #5892 (IE change event does not fire on text input after setting value ... - Opened 22 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5892
[09:28:12] <phdjsep> Sadly that didn't work ;(
[09:28:45] <TL> phdjsep: And to be sure, you did include jquery.js, right?
[09:28:57] <djQuery> I know one of the quys has a plugin that does exactly this
[09:29:44] <phdjsep> Here's what I got: http://jsfiddle.net/kYJLW/
[09:29:46] <Vorspire> manador, are you using jQueryUI Dialog? If you were it would be as easy as subscribing to onclick on the modal overlay
[09:30:27] <manador> Vorspire: no, I'm not too familiar with jQueryUI. But I'll give it a shot
[09:30:27] <manador> what would that look like?
[09:30:34] <TL> phdjsep: http://jsfiddle.net/Whvfj/1/
[09:30:57] <phdjsep> Gah! What was wrong?
[09:31:19] <phdjsep> document ready part huh?
[09:31:21] <TL> Mhm
[09:31:24] <phdjsep> damn it
[09:31:30] <phdjsep> thanks very much TL
[09:31:50] <phdjsep> always the simplest solution
[09:32:17] <Vorspire> (manador): <div id="dialog" title="A Dialog"><p>Content</p></div> - $("#dialog").dialog({ modal: true }); - after initializing with options you can then subscribe to onclick on the .ui-modal-overlay class element
[09:32:35] <djQuery> manador: wouldn't be easier to just hav the div that is showing the content not be inside the overlay? just have the z-index set the overlay under the div. and use css positioning to postion both?
[09:32:55] <manador> djQuery: yeah that was what I was thinking at this point
[09:32:58] <manador> thought I have another idea
[09:33:06] <manador> though*
[09:34:06] <djQuery> manador: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/
[09:35:50] <djQuery> or inside the click function you could just check to see if    if($(this).closest('.modal')){ e.stopPropogation(); return; }
[09:36:36] <djQuery> manador: might need to check to see if the item that was clicked has the class as well
[09:36:40] <Vorspire> had a nasty IE bug earlier but it's fixed now, seems jQuery doesn't normalize attributes on IFrames properly - "scrolling" when set to true or false causes a fatal exception in IE 9 - has to be explicitly set to "yes" or "no" despite other IFrame attributes accepting boolean
[09:37:40] <djQuery> Vorspire: can you set up a fjsfiddle of the issue? sounds like somethign that might need a bug report
[09:38:03] <Vorspire> yea sure thing
[09:43:57] <phdjsep> Someone mind seeing if I can do this? http://jsfiddle.net/bfQ3D/1/
[09:44:20] <Vorspire> djQuery, seems I can't replicate it right now, I'll keep trying
[09:44:37] <phdjsep> Nevermind
[09:44:42] <phdjsep> figured it out!
[09:51:26] <phdjsep> Ok, why does my div immediately close when I put focus on it? http://jsfiddle.net/bfQ3D/2/
[09:53:33] <robin_sz> phdjsep, that jsfiddle wont work, you have no matching html
[09:53:56] <robin_sz> phdjsep, that jsfiddle wont work, you have no matching html
[09:54:15] <phdjsep> Yea, sorry. I was being lazy
[09:54:49] <phdjsep> It's something up with the js. I'll put the html in there
[09:55:02] <djQuery> robin_sz: might be easier to check if there was html to go with that
[09:55:31] <robin_sz> djQuery, dont tell me, tell phdjsep
[09:55:43] <phdjsep> http://jsfiddle.net/bfQ3D/3/
[09:56:37] <robin_sz> appears to be working
[09:57:30] <robin_sz> yes, works perfectly .. slides down and them immendiately slides up, just as you asked
[09:58:03] <phdjsep> oh, but I want it to slide down onfocus and the up onblur (not Focus)
[09:58:26] <robin_sz> slide down on focus I understand
[09:58:43] <robin_sz> what do you mean "the up onblur (not Focus)"
[09:59:39] <phdjsep> So when a user removes focus from the email field, the div "vertical_slide" will slide back up, hiding the 'Name' and 'Organzation
[09:59:42] <phdjsep> fields
[09:59:45] <djQuery> well if you clide up on blur how will you ever populat the other fields
[10:00:05] * robin_sz nods
[10:00:25] <chuck_tes> im buidling website from a flash template. it has flash buttons but i can't seem to find where the button is getting its text from. its not from the index.html, and not from the CSS. each page is basically handed up by individual .xml files?
[10:00:37] <chuck_tes> and the xml files also don't have the text for the buttons.
[10:00:58] <phdjsep> Maybe its my lack of understanding of onblur. I thought that onblur is when a user is no linger focused on a field, correct?
[10:01:11] <robin_sz> like this? http://jsfiddle.net/bfQ3D/4/
[10:01:48] <phdjsep> Exaclty like that! Thank you robin_sz
[10:01:59] <robin_sz> good luck entering data in the other fields ...
[10:02:14] <phdjsep> OH!
[10:02:20] <phdjsep> I see what the problem becomes
[10:02:26] <saddishwasher> can someone help me with adding a class to an element to turn the text red in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/3kznK/
[10:02:33] <phdjsep> thanks for the help!
[10:02:48] <phdjsep> I'll have to rethink this a bit, but much appreciates
[10:02:57] <robin_sz> id hide them when yo upress the submit button
[10:03:23] <phdjsep> My problem is, "what if they decided not to fill out the form
[10:03:49] <robin_sz> provide a cancel button in the slide div
[10:03:56] <djQuery> saddishwasher: there is no tap even
[10:04:05] <djQuery> change it to click and it works fine
[10:04:06] <robin_sz> actually, just provide a modal dialogue in the first place
[10:04:08] <phdjsep> ah
[10:04:20] <saddishwasher> djQuery, sorry I was working with jqTouch
[10:05:11] <phdjsep> modal dialogue being a "show/hide" kind of thing?
[10:05:16] <djQuery> saddishwasher: well its not referenced in the fiddle so it would throw an error
[10:05:17] <saddishwasher> djQuery, my function is with a .tap() which enters correctly (I can add an alert that gets fired properly) but the class isn't getting added
[10:05:43] <robin_sz> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/modal-form.html
[10:05:56] <saddishwasher> djQuery, yea the fiddle will break but I have virtually the same setup within my actual code but it's not working
[10:06:07] <djQuery> saddishwasher: well its not your selector becasue changing it to click highlights correctly
[10:06:11] <robin_sz> "virtually"
[10:06:20] <saddishwasher> djQuery, true
[10:06:24] <saddishwasher> I see that
[10:06:40] <saddishwasher> hmm, then its something else, grr
[10:07:15] <phdjsep> Hmm, cool!
[10:07:17] <djQuery> saddishwasher:  http://jsfiddle.net/3kznK/1/
[10:07:23] <chuck_tes> what is a .as file?
[10:07:38] <saddishwasher> djQuery, yea I know
[10:07:39] <djQuery> added html,Â bodyÂ {height:Â 100%;Â width:Â 100%} and changed it to toggle class
[10:07:47] <saddishwasher> oh ok
[10:08:28] <djQuery> saddishwasher: before html,Â bodyÂ {height:Â 100%;Â width:Â 100%}    when I would click on the bottom of the screen under the text nothing happened and it was a WTF
[10:09:14] <saddishwasher> djQuery, well thats not my issue on my end because my tap (aka click) function enters correctly
[10:09:18] <saddishwasher> must be something with my css
[10:11:01] <phdjsep> are modal forms always popups?
[10:11:47] <systemfault> phdjsep: Modal means that you cannot click anything "below" the popup (An overlay covers the whole page)
[10:12:34] <phdjsep> systemfault: I see, thanks
[10:13:24] <saddishwasher> djQuery, embarrasing moment, the jqTouch css was overriding my styling.  by adding !important to the remove class properties it works fine
[10:13:31] <saddishwasher> thanks for looking at it
[10:14:02] <djQuery> I never like !important  I always forget it because I read it as NOT Important
[10:14:34] <systemfault> Usually.. using |important means that you did something wrong.
[10:15:50] <kaneda^> hey, can i refer to multiple variables by the same id but with different classes and then use something like $("#id .class"); to differentiate it from other id -> classes
[10:17:51] <systemfault> Lulz
[10:18:04] <systemfault> Your markup is invalid, just fix it.
[10:18:28] <djQuery> systemfault: not necisarily. what if you are using the same css
[10:18:47] <djQuery> css\javascript on several different pages
[10:19:11] <systemfault> djQuery: You cannot have 2 elements with the same ID on the same page.
[10:19:31] <djQuery> systemfault: thats not what I said
[10:19:44] <systemfault> Then I misunderstood the question.
[10:19:45] <systemfault> My bad.
[10:20:52] <djQuery> kaneda^: as long as they aren't on the same page at the same time
[10:25:27] <kaneda^> djquery, so if i want them at the page at the same time i have to give them a unique id?
[10:30:31] <red_square> yes
[10:45:52] <TwinglyTingly> hello, stupid question: how to select img tags which are child of a <a> tag to add a <div> children to the <img> tag
[10:46:26] <snover> well you canâ€™t add children to image tags, so uh
[10:46:51] <TwinglyTingly> hmm, i want a nice overlay div before the img tag if the img tag is a children of a <a> tag
[10:46:57] <TwinglyTingly> so children to <a> tag?
[10:48:13] <TwinglyTingly> so $('a > img').parent.addchildren is correct?
[10:49:08] <Eviltwin> You need some ()'s
[10:49:17] <TwinglyTingly> yes after addchildren
[10:49:24] <Eviltwin> jQuery uses methods for just about everything
[10:49:25] <TwinglyTingly> but as selector this will work?
[10:49:36] <TwinglyTingly> also parent? -> parent() ?
[10:49:48] <Eviltwin> Yes
[10:49:53] <Eviltwin> Effectively everything
[10:49:56] <Eviltwin> ?.parent @ TwinglyTingly
[10:49:57] <bot-t> TwinglyTingly, .parent([selector]): Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[10:50:39] <TwinglyTingly> yip, I'll test that out and nag u again if it wont work :-)
[10:50:52] <Eviltwin> And there's also no built-in "addchildren"
[10:50:56] <Eviltwin> So...yeah
[10:51:44] <Eviltwin> It doesn't make sense for there to be
[10:51:58] <Eviltwin> Because elements need to be added in a particular place
[10:52:46] <TwinglyTingly> append() will do the job?
[10:52:55] <Eviltwin> If you want them to be appended, then yet
[10:52:57] <Eviltwin> yes*
[11:31:37] <saddishwasher> hey all - I'm needing help with an event bubbling.  the fiddle is not functional it just shows the two functions that are bubbling.   http://jsfiddle.net/j33kJ/1/
[11:33:15] <Eviltwin> Uh... .tap?
[11:33:42] <saddishwasher> Eviltwin, sorry, I'm using jqTouch and keep forgetting to change it to .click for jsfiddle and you guys
[11:33:58] <saddishwasher> the functionality is the same though so overlook that part
[11:34:09] <Eviltwin> Do you understand the concept of making a demo?
[11:34:11] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ saddishwasher
[11:34:13] <bot-t> saddishwasher, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:34:20] <saddishwasher> Eviltwin, lol yes I do
[11:34:29] <Eviltwin> "a live (working) demo"
[11:34:43] <Eviltwin> There are no elements in the <body> here
[11:34:48] <Eviltwin> How the hell can this be a live working demo?
[11:34:49] <saddishwasher> yes yes I just thought someone could help with the bubbling philosphy rather than the syntax issues I have
[11:35:44] <Eviltwin> Yes but I have no idea what they structure looks like
[11:35:45] <saddishwasher> Eviltwin, but if its that big of a deal I'll make it live :p
[11:35:53] <saddishwasher> hold on
[11:35:56] <Eviltwin> Without the structure, I don't know what bubbles where
[11:36:02] <Eviltwin> There's a reason we ask for a live working demo
[11:36:11] <Eviltwin> It's to help us help you
[11:37:56] <saddishwasher> got it got it got it :p
[11:40:26] <saddishwasher> Eviltwin, http://jsfiddle.net/j33kJ/4/
[11:40:44] <saddishwasher> Heres the issue, the bubbling has stopped with return false...
[11:41:02] <saddishwasher> but I need the document.body click to still remove the class if .pad is present
[11:41:15] <saddishwasher> so in a sense, I NEED it to bubble
[11:42:00] <Eviltwin> So don't return false
[11:42:35] <saddishwasher> but then the document.body click overrides the a.edit click and nothing happens because the .pad class is toggled in both
[11:42:52] <Eviltwin> I'm not understanding what you're trying to accomplish then
[11:43:09] <Eviltwin> The return false is only preventing the body click if you're clicking an a.edit
[11:43:25] <saddishwasher> 1) on 'Edit' and 'Done' click I need to toggle the class 'pad and nopad'
[11:43:37] <Eviltwin> You seem to be doing that
[11:43:51] <saddishwasher> 2) on document click (if class .pad is present) i need to toggle it with .nopad
[11:44:25] <saddishwasher> so basically I want to be able to remove the .pad class if 'Done' is clicked and if 'document.body' is clicked
[11:44:46] <saddishwasher> sort of like a 'lost focus' event...
[11:45:07] <saddishwasher> hmmm or do Iâ€¦.damn I don't even know what I needâ€¦. hold on
[12:40:30] <Noeble> I wrote a jquery script in a version in I think 1.6.x.. but it started generate errors so I read that those were fixed in the latest version. I upgraded.. and now halv my script stoped working.. but it generates no errors at all.. only the dropdown shows. http://dpaste.com/694444/
[13:30:33] <Noeble> question: Iam trying to make an syncronous ajax request.. and I wanna return the result to a variable to use it outside the actual request.. how can I acomplish this?
[13:32:16] <wookiehangover> Noeble: you should always use ajax requests asynchronously
[13:33:17] <wookiehangover> and you would attach a callback to the deferred object issued by the ajax to populate its result where ever you need it to go
[13:33:50] <wookiehangover> ?done
[13:33:51] <bot-t> deferred.done(doneCallbacks, [doneCallbacks]): Add handlers to be called when the Deferred object is resolved. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[13:35:07] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/d3abq/ how come that alerts for only "test.com" and not the second one?
[13:37:25] <Noeble> wookiehangover: I need to make an extra request when looping through an already made async ajax request
[13:38:46] <wookiehangover> someprimetime: your plugin needs to return this.each
[13:38:50] <wookiehangover> https://github.com/OscarGodson/jQuery-Plugin-Skeleton
[13:39:06] <wookiehangover> its only matching to the first selector
[13:39:09] <Engin> looks like getting image size in .load can fail... and i see no further ways of improving this
[13:39:17] <Engin> looks like there's no rock solid way of getting image width
[13:40:08] <wookiehangover> Engin: https://gist.github.com/268257
[13:40:11] <wookiehangover> there is ^^
[13:40:17] <wookiehangover> sorry
[13:40:18] <wookiehangover> https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[13:40:23] <wookiehangover> first link was wrong
[13:40:42] <someprimetime> wookiehangover: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/d3abq/1/ just that?
[13:40:48] <someprimetime> or https://github.com/OscarGodson/jQuery-Plugin-Skeleton/blob/master/jquery.plugin.js#L30
[13:40:53] <wookiehangover> someprimetime: no
[13:41:41] <wookiehangover> my bad
[13:42:34] <wookiehangover> http://jsfiddle.net/wookiehangover/d3abq/2/
[13:42:45] <wookiehangover> i dunno, seems like its doing what you want it to
[13:43:38] <wookiehangover> oh so the reason why you just get the first parent in that alert
[13:43:50] <wookiehangover> sidenote, don't use alerts for debugging, btw
[13:44:08] <Noeble> wookiehangover: it must be posible to make an extra $.get inside a loop, looping through an already made ajax call?
[13:44:14] <someprimetime> yeah, i usually don't
[13:44:20] <wookiehangover> is because `this` in that context is still pointing to the first selector
[13:44:38] <wookiehangover> it won't enumerate through them until you're inside your each loop
[13:45:06] <someprimetime> ah, makes sense
[13:46:21] <Noeble> wookiehangover: look at this.. this worked in 1.6.x.. but in 1.7.. it stoped working. http://dpaste.com/694444/
[13:46:52] <Noeble> wookiehangover: problem seem to be in row 33
[13:49:07] <Engin> wookiehangover: hmm, hope it'll work, once i fix the errors it is generating :)
[13:49:47] <Engin> does it depend on a very recent jq or what ?
[13:49:57] <wookiehangover> 1.4
[13:49:59] <wookiehangover> i believe
[13:50:31] <Engin> well, I have 1.6.2
[13:50:36] <wookiehangover> you should be fine then
[13:51:02] <Engin> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'notify'
[13:56:47] <Engin> wookiehangover: version added 1.7 apparently
[13:56:59] <wookiehangover> Engin: word
[13:57:53] <Engin> word what
[13:59:16] <wookiehangover> ?mlym
[13:59:16] <bot-t> much like your mother
[14:09:29] <Engin> hmm imagesLoaded this context refers to DOMWindow... actually it is a img element
[14:11:36] <oojacoboo> if I have a custom function that has an $.ajax() call in it and I want to be sure that this ajax call has .done before running any other code after calling this function, how can I go about this?
[14:11:55] <oojacoboo> I'm assuming I need to do some sort of callback, but I'm not quite sure how I'd build this out
[14:14:22] * robin_sz slaps head
[14:14:51] <robin_sz> apparently you actually have to send the jquery/js stuff to the browser
[14:15:11] <robin_sz> typing it into the middel of a PHP function does not work
[14:19:45] <nicholasschulz> I want to change the second options list when the first one is changedâ€¦. How do I make the second (Velg sted) change its content when .change() ?
[14:19:46] <nicholasschulz> http://bannaky.com/sell.php
[14:20:36] <robin_sz> I dont see any options list
[14:20:55] <robin_sz> but, i suspect an onChange() handler might be the way
[14:22:15] <nicholasschulz> robin_sz "Velg fag for Ã¥ fortsette" is the list ?.. Yes, I know to use the .change(); but how do I make the CONTENT of the second one to change?
[14:22:55] <nicholasschulz> Oh - so sorry. forgot you need login
[14:22:56] <nicholasschulz> 2 sec
[14:23:10] <robin_sz> yes, that would help
[14:23:35] <robin_sz> anyway, persoannly, if I had say 3 items in list A, and wanted 3 different versions of List B
[14:24:11] <nicholasschulz> Try it now. removed the login requirement. http://bannaky.com/sell.php
[14:24:25] <robin_sz> I wuold put the 3 versions into divs, and hide() them all, just showing the one I wanted after a change() event ?
[14:25:43] <nicholasschulz> robin_sz : its connected to a database and is dynamic so I have to load new content
[14:25:45] <nicholasschulz> on change
[14:26:00] <robin_sz> so, in that case ...
[14:27:03] <oojacoboo> nicholasschulz: use json
[14:27:12] <oojacoboo> I wouldn't send a request to the server
[14:27:22] <robin_sz> use change()  to call $.getJSON(url, function(data){ populateSecondList(data) });
[14:27:55] <tw2113> mmm json
[14:28:18] <robin_sz> then that function calls empty() on the list and then populates it with new elelments from the data you get back from json
[14:29:08] <robin_sz> for added points, display a small "loading" graphic over the list while the json call is in progress
[14:29:57] <robin_sz> having reviewed your homepage, if I understand the business model correctly, you take books, feed them through some sort of web page, and it turns them into popcorn?
[14:31:36] <nicholasschulz> robin_sz : haha :-p the website is for students that can sell their old literature to upcoming students. They get money and the new saves money ;-) Think it will work? :-p
[14:32:05] <djQuery> you first have to clear the 2nd option list of its options. Then you have to add all the options back in
[14:32:51] <SigmaProjects> I'm having a wierd issue where a string like "CO - 91 - 92 - 93 - 94" is turned into "CO - [ - \ - ] - 94"   has anyone seen this before?
[14:38:28] <robin_sz> nicholasschulz, you can already do that on Amazon ...
[14:39:01] <nicholasschulz> no one in norway uses amazon.. we have similar services but they cost.
[14:39:02] <robin_sz> and then there is ebay ...
[14:39:15] <robin_sz> you are doing this for free?
[14:39:23] <nicholasschulz> just a fun project
[14:39:34] <robin_sz> ah, ok, it might if you can get enough to use it
[14:39:52] <robin_sz> I only see one problem ;)
[14:39:59] <nicholasschulz> whats that ? :-p
[14:40:17] <robin_sz> most of the books will be sold when people finish their course .. the last year
[14:40:30] <robin_sz> so they want to sell end of summer ...
[14:40:51] <robin_sz> new students arrive only in the autumn ..
[14:41:29] <nicholasschulz> Thats only a problem for graduating students. The rest will go back to school as usual the next semester when new students start
[14:41:36] <robin_sz> yes true
[14:41:46] <robin_sz> but I would keep my books until the end of the course
[14:41:52] <robin_sz> but, who knows
[14:42:13] <nicholasschulz> Hehe yes.. Its more practice for me than a service for them really :-p
[14:42:18] <robin_sz> hey, which university?
[14:42:28] <nicholasschulz> multiple
[14:42:45] <robin_sz> ok, my sister works at a .no university ...
[14:43:21] <nicholasschulz> what university?
[14:43:24] <nicholasschulz> in oslo?
[14:44:23] <robin_sz> no, stavnger i think
[14:44:43] <robin_sz> or even stavanger
[14:45:29] <nicholasschulz> Ok ;-) Then I probably have never met her
[14:46:41] <robin_sz> probably not
[15:04:19] <joshualibrarian> So... I am in the _create function of a jquery-ui widget, and I want to bind the clicks of a range of items, so $('.someClass').click(function(event) { });... but inside fo that function, how do I access the object that was clicked?  event is undefined.
[15:06:06] <red_square> this joshualibrarian
[15:06:30] <joshualibrarian> hmm.. I did try that... trying agian...
[15:07:49] <joshualibrarian> red_square:  okay then, so how do I access 'this' from the previous scope, to get access to all my this.members ?
[15:08:05] <red_square> var self = this
[15:08:12] <red_square> then use self in the click fn
[15:10:18] <joshualibrarian> red_square: the click function isn't even running... the bind isn't working... do I have to use some other syntax to bind clicks on various objects from here in the widget?

[15:14:10] <chuck_tes> i have a quesion about the template on this site: http://www.flashmo.com/preview/flashmo_244_diamond_cafe
[15:14:48] <chuck_tes> How do you change the texts of each sectiot? ie: Introduction, Our Company, ect?
[15:15:52] <Phrogz_> chuck_tes: What sections on that site that has an enormous flash that I didn't load as the main content?
[15:16:41] <chuck_tes> Well I know how to change the content under each section (its a corresponding .xml file).
[15:16:47] <Phrogz_> Eww! It's an entire site as a Flash? chuck_tes: run away from that idea as fast as possible.
[15:17:19] <chuck_tes> I just don't know hwo to change the text for Introduction, Services, ect. Theres I check the html, the CSS, the XMLs, can't figur eit out
[15:17:22] <chuck_tes> Why what swrong with it?
[15:17:25] <chuck_tes> I think it looks nice.
[15:17:54] <chuck_tes> I thought flash was good?
[15:18:03] <Phrogz_> chuck_tes: It's nothing but Flash! People without flash installed can't see it. People like me who have Flash blocked won't see it.
[15:18:12] <Phrogz_> Nobody with an iPad or iPhone will be able to use your site.
[15:18:24] <Phrogz_> You thought wrong.
[15:19:32] <chuck_tes> 0o0o. Mobile devices.  I like the effects, the button transistions, the right side of the page animations.    Is there a better alternative?
[15:19:55] <chuck_tes> Also, is there any specific reason you have flash disabled?
[15:20:36] <smplstk> reason number 1: flash sucks
[15:20:42] <smplstk> (there are no other reasons)
[15:20:44] <Phrogz_> chuck_tes: It is responsible for 75% of the OS crashes for OS X. It causes my wife's laptop to generally overheat. It is almost always advertisements.
[15:21:01] <chuck_tes> o00o ok.
[15:21:05] <gloomer> flash is going bye bye
[15:21:07] <chuck_tes> So is there a better alternative?
[15:21:09] <trepidacious> I know this isn't the right channel but... I'm sure there is some (possibly not standard) html tag or attribute that can be used to prompt for printing a page when it loads. This might be Chrom only... can't find it anywhere, but I'm sure I've used it before.
[15:21:19] <gloomer> chuck_tes html5
[15:21:26] <chuck_tes> Something that is more reliable and works on both computers and mobile devices?
[15:21:43] <Phrogz_> trepidacious: An HTML tag or attribute that...what? You mean a JavaScript method to pretend like the user chose file->print?
[15:21:45] <chuck_tes> so html5 is better than flash?
[15:21:48] <gloomer> yes
[15:21:51] <smplstk> better for
[15:21:55] <smplstk> PENETRATION
[15:22:02] <Phrogz_> chuck_tes: For most criterion of what "better" means, yes.
[15:22:40] <trepidacious> Phrogz_: No, to display the page with the fancy chrome print sidebar - it doesn't actually print, it just prepares to do so. I'm pretty sure it was HTML rather than javascript, but I could be wrong.
[15:22:45] <chuck_tes>   I'm gonna go back to the drawing board and reassess this. Thanks.
[15:23:32] <Phrogz_> s/criterion/criteria/ *facepalm*
[15:23:56] <gloomer> close enough
[15:25:11] <smplstk> why'd he quit? I was just gonna tell him that everything in that template was 100% possible with html5
[15:25:19] <smplstk> OH WELL
[15:26:40] <trepidacious> Phrogz_: You know how Google Docs go straight to a print dialog when you print them? That kind of thing.
[15:26:51] <Phrogz_> trepidacious: I don't.
[15:35:01] <trepidacious> Phrogz_: Hmm... maybe it WAS javascript, oops ;)
[15:39:46] <joshualibrarian> Okay... why does only one alert come up?  http://jsfiddle.net/HEb3p/8/
[15:40:02] <joshualibrarian> there should be two instances of the damn plugin
[15:44:16] <keybo> can anyone help me with a php question, how can i declare a variable within a function then access it from outside of that function?
[15:44:56] <gloomer> you cant
[15:44:59] <gloomer> violation of scope
[15:45:06] <joshualibrarian> keybo:  pass it around.
[15:47:43] <joshualibrarian> oh... I just can't do that?  I can't have two instances of the same plugin pointing to the same dom element?
[15:47:59] <someprimetime> ?plugin @ joshualibrarian
[15:48:06] <someprimetime> guess bot-t isn't here
[15:48:12] <someprimetime> joshualibrarian: http://www.learningjquery.com/2007/10/a-plugin-development-pattern
[15:48:26] <someprimetime> you're going to have to write a plugin to prevent namespace conflicts
[15:48:30] <someprimetime> which is what i'm currently doing fwiw
[15:51:07] <keybo> in answer to my own question, you have to use the global statement :p
[15:51:54] <joshualibrarian> I'll just put the damn thing on two elements... seems easier.
[15:52:33] <kinesis> i wrote some jquery to center a div called '.content-block' contained inside a main div called '#content'  - http://paste.pocoo.org/show/542394/  - wh y wont this approach work?
[15:52:35] <bjensen> um the not() doesn't work with square brackets? as in $(".user_id:not([id='4'])") ?
[15:52:40] <kinesis> im basically trying to avoid using the <center> tag
[15:53:09] <someprimetime> keybo: in php? learn into private, protected, and public methods
[15:53:14] <someprimetime> look into, rather
[15:53:34] <someprimetime> joshualibrarian: it'll be easier to write a plugin since you can re-use it multiple times
[15:53:42] <someprimetime> not to mention more DRY
[15:53:46] <Cherrum> Is there an easy way to get the sum of elements in an array without having to run through a loop? for example myArray = [1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0] would have a sum of 6 ?
[15:53:59] <Cherrum> er -?
[15:54:22] <someprimetime> Cherrum: how would it know what the sum of all the elements is if it hasn't looked through all of them?
[15:55:02] <someprimetime> you can obviously see how much space has been allocated in terms of the .length method, but if it can't traverse through them, it can't add them up
[15:56:09] <keybo> is the length specified on a mysql table column in characters?
[15:56:25] <someprimetime> kinesis: why are you centering your div with margin-left and margin-right?
[15:56:33] <someprimetime> wouldn't it make more sense to use position?
[15:56:54] <someprimetime> keybo: what?
[15:58:04] <keybo> lets say its set to varchar(10) would that mean the longest value in that field could be 10 characters long?
[15:58:06] <Cherrum> I might as well just store the values that are used to generate the array(s) in that case, seems asinine to 'rediscover' the sum later on :P
[15:59:21] <kinesis> i wrote some jquery to center a div called '.content-block' contained inside a main div called '#content'  - http://paste.pocoo.org/show/542394/  - wh y wont this approach work? im trying to avoid using the center tag
[15:59:26] <bot-t> keybo, While a little bit of off-topic banter is generally harmless, extended discussion of SQL and PHP is off-topic for this channel, so let's please move on.
[15:59:42] <someprimetime> +1 bot-t
[16:00:27] <joshualibrarian> okay, well now they are on different elements and STILL only one works!  http://jsfiddle.net/HEb3p/13/
[16:00:44] <keybo> it matters when my ajax function is sending to a php script which queries the db and returns json back to it damnit :P1
[16:03:24] <kinesis> how do i center a div in a div with jquery
[16:03:27] <joshualibrarian> oh shit! typo!
[16:04:02] <red_square> kinesis u do it with css
[16:05:07] <keybo> was it the # on testb stopping it from working?
[16:05:39] <kinesis> you cant do it with css
[16:06:00] <kinesis> i tried anyways. it seemd more practical to use jquery
[16:06:22] <kinesis> i have a special template i designed.. it's intricate
[16:06:32] <red_square> and what is jquery going to do.....use css
[16:06:41] <kinesis> change the css elements
[16:06:44] <kinesis> look at my paste
[16:06:48] <gloomer> to do it with jquery i would use jquery to assign a css class :)
[16:06:51] <kinesis> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/542394/
[16:07:07] <red_square> gloomer well you cant do it with css
[16:07:18] <red_square> kinesis says so
[16:07:51] <kinesis> you can using margin, and calculated pixel
[16:08:21] <kinesis> i googled 'center a div in a div' over and over
[16:11:25] <gloomer> kinessis show ur html
[16:11:29] <gloomer> sure there is way to do it with css
[16:13:16] <kinesis> ok im uploading it
[16:15:56] <kinesis> i have to remove proprietary stuff rom it
[16:15:57] <kinesis> from it
[16:16:02] <kinesis> which is cool because ill need help anyways
[16:17:03] <someprimetime> kinesis: use position: relative; and left: X where X is the parent div's width / 2
[16:17:14] <someprimetime> and stop using margin-left to center things
[16:17:26] <someprimetime> also you are positioning the same amount with margin-left and margin-right
[16:17:30] <someprimetime> which doesn't do anything
[16:18:40] <kinesis> i cant use position anything
[16:18:44] <oojacoboo> lol at the jquery bug
[16:18:46] <kinesis> when you see my template youll understand what im trying to do
[16:18:53] <kinesis> it has a top bar liek facebook or twitter
[16:19:01] <oojacoboo> man, you throw too much at it and it just craps out :P
[16:19:06] <kinesis> its tricky
[16:19:34] <oojacoboo> I'm doing a scrollTop with a json parsing and a jquery ui highlight
[16:19:43] <oojacoboo> and the browser just sticks with the highlight on
[16:19:47] <oojacoboo> never finishes the animation
[16:21:13] <oojacoboo> yea, I forgot to mention the pager in as well
[16:21:51] <bjensen> I have 2 arrays and I want to subtract one from the other, how would you guys do this?
[16:22:22] <kinesis> http://kinesis.me/beta/
[16:22:37] <kinesis> #1) i am trying to center the box in the middle.. #2 i want the footer to always be at the bottom of the doc, not fixed...
[16:23:07] <kinesis> the top bar always stays stationary.. like twitter or facebook
[16:23:32] <kinesis> in fact reload it in 30 secs.. youll see what i mean.. holdup
[16:24:29] <pifantastic> bjensen: what do you mean, subtract?
[16:24:49] <pifantastic> subtract each value in array a with its corresponding value in array b
[16:24:50] <pifantastic> OR
[16:24:51] <bjensen> pifantastic: http://groups.google.com/group/tiddlywiki/browse_thread/thread/d019e2ed5dc38e49
[16:25:04] <kinesis> Ok now reload it. I want the box in the center of the page... via CSS. i want the bottom bar at the bottom, absolute left: 0 bottom: 0
[16:25:09] <bjensen> but I guess there is no awesome way to do this so I will have to use the solution that was posted
[16:25:09] <pifantastic> remove the items in array a from array b?
[16:25:23] <bjensen> pifantastic: yes or produce a new array with that result
[16:27:17] <pifantastic> bjensen: yeah, there is no native way to do that
[16:27:20] <pifantastic> if that's what you're after
[16:28:04] <kinesis> so do i need jquery to smack that login box in the center of the page
[16:28:08] <kinesis> or can css handle it
[16:28:19] <kinesis> i cant use <center> (would be so much easier if i could)
[16:28:20] <pifantastic> bjensen: underscore has some methods that can help: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#without
[16:29:06] <bjensen> blast..the method I found uses [1,2,3].contains â€¦doenst seam to be be a valid javascript method
[16:29:21] <pifantastic> bjensen: indexOf
[16:29:28] <bjensen> right
[16:29:30] <bjensen> thanks
[16:31:31] <kinesis> http://www.kinesis.me/beta
[16:31:38] <kinesis> you said i can use CSS to center that
[16:31:41] <kinesis> ive googled left and right
[16:32:00] <pifantastic> kinesis: margin: 0 auto;
[16:32:03] <pifantastic> with a width
[16:32:40] <kinesis> Pifantastic: margin: 0 auto where?
[16:32:45] <pifantastic> kinesis: http://grimhappy.com/i/5e6672c.png
[16:32:45] <kinesis> on .content-block or #content
[16:33:10] <pifantastic> sorry, better ss: http://grimhappy.com/i/bc2bc3.png
[16:33:20] <smplstk> margin: 0 auto all the things
[16:33:29] <kinesis> does that site render properly on a higher resoluition screen? its suppose to be facebook or twitter style
[16:33:32] <kinesis> with the bar at the top
[16:33:32] <smplstk> .content-block { margin: 0 auto; }
[16:33:37] <smplstk> if you want the exact rule
[16:33:58] <kinesis> How do you keep the footer at the very bottom no matter what
[16:34:01] <kinesis> do you need jQuery?
[16:34:50] <smplstk> ?g sticky footer css @ kinesis
[16:34:51] <bot-t> kinesis, New CSS Sticky Footer - 2010 - HTML for Bottom of Page Footer - http://www.cssstickyfooter.com/
[16:35:10] <smplstk> kinesis: google around, there's ways of doing it with pure css
[16:35:12] <bonhoffer> is there a clean way to do a tooltip from a datepicker that is pulling in json dates
[16:35:13] <smplstk> aka no jQuery
[16:35:50] <kinesis> i cant implement that
[16:35:57] <kinesis> it will mess up my nav bar at the top
[16:36:43] <kinesis> i have a sticky header :)
[16:37:11] <kinesis> also it's not quite centered at the top as I'd like it
[16:37:14] <smplstk> kinesis: body { position: relative; } #footer { position: fixed; bottom: 0; }
[16:37:15] <smplstk> DONE
[16:38:01] <kinesis> i have that but if you press Ctrl - a bunch of times it unsticks
[16:38:10] <kinesis> heh
[16:38:36] <kinesis> why fixed?
[16:38:38] <kinesis> it just glues
[16:39:11] <kinesis> i mean bottom like when i scroll down, it's there.. its either glued to the bottom of the screen, or with content i scroll down and its at the page stop
[16:39:37] <pifantastic> kinesis: #footer { position: sticky-bottom }
[16:40:02] <kinesis> is that compatible or css3
[16:40:08] <pifantastic> i just made it up
[16:40:15] <pifantastic> so it's probably not compatible with anything
[16:40:24] <kinesis> i used position: relative; bottom: 0;
[16:40:30] <kinesis> it works OK until you zoom out too much
[16:41:08] <pifantastic> kinesis: why don't you find a site that behaves that way, and see how they did it?
[16:43:18] <kinesis> idk i give up
[16:43:22] <kinesis> im just gonna sell the domain
[16:43:28] <kinesis> cant get capital anyways
[17:01:05] <theBrettman> anyone know how to integrate the themeroller changer into a page so you can change the themes if you want?
[17:01:38] <DimmuR> Hello. I'm using datatables with serverSide + pagination. I want to submit form with all data, not only for page i'm in - i've already done adding selected items to list but how can i prepare data for $.post() so i could submit it?
[17:02:13] <theBrettman> save the values from the other page in session var?
[17:03:14] <theBrettman> what language u using for ur server side?
[17:04:00] <DimmuR> already have that var with id's of selected items but can't figure out how to submit it
[17:05:12] <theBrettman> ?p @DimmuR
[17:05:22] <theBrettman> damn, I never get that right
[17:05:56] <gloomer> add them to datastring and submit them through .post or ajax?
[17:06:29] <theBrettman> he needs to post an example on jsfiddle or something but I don't know how to get the bot to post instructions, lol
[17:06:47] <theBrettman> wow, both bots just quit too, lol
[17:06:54] <DimmuR> gloomer, i'm trying by http://paste.ofcode.org/su4LUYwCBvSeXEsR8Sc2EL but it doesn't work (selected_controls is Array of id's)
[17:07:45] <theBrettman> that's a weird way to do it
[17:08:44] <theBrettman> is #package_list the form?
[17:09:16] <DimmuR> yes it's a form
[17:09:25] <theBrettman> you got some bad syntax too
[17:09:52] <theBrettman> that's why we use jsfiddle so we can either use lint on it or catch it in our inspector
[17:10:08] <theBrettman> you got a couple statements not terminated
[17:11:49] <DeadCode> hello
[17:11:53] <theBrettman> plus you can step through it with breakpoints and check assignments
[17:11:58] <theBrettman> ohai
[17:12:25] <theBrettman> and you can have your html there... so plz put it in a fiddle
[17:12:34] <gloomer> so much easier to debug
[17:13:07] <theBrettman> so anyone know how to get themeroller into my page?
[17:13:15] <theBrettman> I just wanna change between default themes
[17:13:40] <theBrettman> you would think they would just put it on it's ui page but no...
[17:14:42] <gloomer> theBrettman just switch out the whole css file
[17:15:07] <theBrettman> I want to be able to switch between them
[17:15:53] <gloomer> http://www.webgeekly.com/tutorials/jquery/how-to-switch-css-files-on-the-fly-using-jquery/
[17:16:13] <theBrettman> yes but they already have a plugin for displaying them all and picking them
[17:16:54] <theBrettman> see the dropdown at the top of this page: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/ ?
[17:16:56] <theBrettman> that's what I want
[17:17:41] <theBrettman> nvm, found it
[17:17:41] <exiva> I'm having trouble with a ajax xml request on Internet Explorer. When I make a call with http://jsfiddle.net/VCBBD/ it works fine on Safari, Firefox, Chrome but on IE it always fails with "Access is denied" I'm not sure how I solve this issue
[17:18:45] <gloomer> theBrettman its all on their site :)
[17:18:46] <gloomer> jack it
[17:19:10] <theBrettman> it's also right here: http://jqueryui.com/docs/Theming/ThemeSwitcher
[17:19:12] <gloomer> which version of ie
[17:19:40] <gloomer> well that makes it easy
[17:20:12] <exiva> gloomer IE9
[17:21:41] <rogo> .length() returning wrong size on first load, because @font-face hasn't loaded font?
[17:21:51] <rogo> any suggestions of how to make it wait for the font to load
[17:21:53] <rogo> http://jsfiddle.net/qupodogbark/3738u/1/
[17:26:25] <theBrettman> someone needs to ban Nuck from all channels!
[17:26:56] <gloomer> exiva I can only guess its the crossdomain
[17:26:59] <gloomer> and to use an iframe
[17:27:13] <theBrettman> seems like once an hour, Nuck is now known as NuckOff
[17:27:43] <exiva> gloomer What goes in the iFrame?
[17:27:53] <rogo> does anyone have a solution to .length() returning the wrong size of h1's because of @font-face?
[17:27:54] <rogo> http://jsfiddle.net/qupodogbark/3738u/1/
[17:29:11] <theBrettman> I don't see any error, rogo
[17:29:49] <rogo> if you check the size of the h1's with firebug it's different than the size jquery says
[17:29:57] <Eviltwin> rogo: Those are the right widths
[17:30:07] <rogo> but only on the first run
[17:30:14] <zorph> my $.ajax error callback isn't being called when I get 500 error...is that normal behavior?
[17:30:22] <rogo> close the fiddle and reopen it
[17:30:25] <rogo> and the first time it will print the wrong widths
[17:30:29] <zorph> ideally I'd like out output the error
[17:30:31] <Eviltwin> It did not
[17:30:38] <rogo> and then every subsequent time it will print the right ones
[17:30:39] <zorph> I can use firebug...but my client cant
[17:30:46] <Eviltwin> It's been working fine for me every time
[17:30:50] <theBrettman> it says the right sizes in chrome
[17:30:50] <Eviltwin> First load in multiple browsers
[17:31:01] <rogo> i'm in chrome too
[17:31:13] <rogo> i'll check again
[17:31:41] <gloomer> exiva are you using php backend?
[17:31:57] <exiva> Yeah, I have a php proxy setup that adds the headers to allow cross domain
[17:32:07] <rogo> yeah, i'm still getting  disparity
[17:32:19] <rogo> for the first h1 it tells me 343, when it's actually 351
[17:32:26] <theBrettman> 500 is internal server error zorph
[17:32:27] <exiva> gloomer https://gist.github.com/1696612
[17:32:41] <rogo> but if no one else is getting that error then i'll assume it's just my computer, and nothing to worry about
[17:32:57] <theBrettman> meaning the server doesn't know how to handle what you sent to it
[17:33:30] <theBrettman> Eviltwin, the bots died...
[17:33:38] <zorph> theBrettman: yup I know..it happened when trying to run sql (column cant' be null)
[17:33:49] <theBrettman> oh, bot-t is back, lol
[17:34:01] <theBrettman> ha, they died again
[17:34:09] <rogo> thanks Eviltwin thanks theBrettman
[17:34:19] <zorph> it returns html..so why can't that html be returned to the ajax call?
[17:34:50] <theBrettman> it's expecting html u mean...
[17:35:00] <zorph> hmm...my framework does redirect to the error conroller...so maybe ajax can't handle a redirected content..
[17:35:16] <zorph> *controller
[17:35:32] <zorph> that must be the issue, the php script runs a redirect..
[17:45:25] <zorph> yes my zendframework was at fault..the ErrorController was setting the error code to 500 if no other errors matched...
[17:45:37] <zorph> I removed that line and now it outputs the error to the ajax...
[18:33:26] <someprimetime> is $.fn.reverseText.test = function() {} in http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/d3abq/4/ the proper way to add a function within the plugin?
[18:33:29] <someprimetime> or is there a better way?
[19:02:41] <malikmasr> http://pastebin.com/RZ24L6qy can someone tell me why my browser crashes when i run this code?
[19:03:04] <malikmasr> im basically trying to get the json file parsed, and populate a portfolio with it
[19:24:46] <trusktr> What values does the "helper" option for draggable take?
[19:45:19] <destryalhmns> test
[19:45:32] <destryalhmns> ah so i have not been permenantly banned
[19:45:45] <destryalhmns> however, i will still use the word gay
[19:45:57] <destryalhmns> and when i am right i will not pretend to not be right
[19:46:00] <destryalhmns> topic 1
[19:46:23] <destryalhmns> jquery is shockingly slower than straight javascript. run this test i just made view-source:http://www.seanmchugh.info/compare.htm
[19:47:13] <destryalhmns> http://www.seanmchugh.info/compare.htm is the link, i was just suggesting you view source to prove it to yoruself
[19:50:38] <destryalhmns> here is another fascinating thing i found today.. http://www.seanmchugh.info/awesomeidea.htm zoom on dom elements, years old but ..........hello?
[19:57:54] <_zoggy_> yes jquery is not the fastest.. but deff easier and quicker to write code in
[19:58:45] <destryalhmns> ah
[19:58:48] <destryalhmns> okay
[19:58:54] <destryalhmns> id like op
[19:58:58] <destryalhmns> my reasons:
[19:59:03] <destryalhmns> i will not ever boot anyone
[19:59:16] <destryalhmns> i do jquery daily and consider myself to be pretty good with it
[19:59:48] <destryalhmns> i am honest
[19:59:53] <destryalhmns> so
[20:00:00] <destryalhmns> ive neer been op before
[20:00:08] <destryalhmns> dont care about op, just dont appreciate getting booted
[20:00:11] <_zoggy_> you are quite annoying. stop hitting enter so often. complete a complete thought...
[20:00:21] <destryalhmns> and its like a min 400% slower... that IS something
[20:00:33] <destryalhmns> zoggy but i have facts
[20:00:41] <_zoggy_> if you dont like it. dont use it. simple as that.
[20:18:48] <destryalhmns> http://www.seanmchugh.info/awesomeidea.htm
[20:18:51] <tigrang> how can I submit a form with custom data (without ajax)
[20:19:10] <destryalhmns> serious jquery potential there
[20:19:23] <destryalhmns> anyone else on board?
[20:54:35] <renic> I'm hoping someone can help me.  I'm trying to implement JQuery.validationEngine and it's throwing an alert with the message "unknown popup type:" ... when I look at the code, I see it's actually telling me '"unknown popup type:"+type' but type appears to be empty.
[20:55:00] <renic> other than that, it seems to be working.
[20:55:14] <renic> firebug console is being mostly unhelpful.
[20:58:12] <renic> If i comment out the line which throws the alert(), which the default at the end of a switch statement, everything behaves as expected.
[20:58:19] <renic> totally random :/ :)
[21:45:03] <zweb> I have a html canvas signature box that saves a data url of the signature image. I am submitting a form with many fields and want the signature image data uri strings to be included in the post request along with the form submit. What is the best way to accomplish this? Thanks. http://dpaste.com/694593/
[22:09:20] <ch3mical> zweb: how are you submitting the POST data? Standard form submit or AJAX?
[22:14:49] <zweb> I am currently submitting it normally and checking for a post request in view to validate otherwise render blank form.
[22:15:14] <zweb> Would be easiest if I could p[lug the image strings into the normal form submit but I also can switch submit to ajax
[22:16:35] <ch3mical> Well if it'
[22:17:18] <zweb> they currently sign and then it replaces the img.src with the new signature
[22:17:19] <ch3mical> s not AJAX, it should be as simple as having a hidden field and just set the value of the field before you submit
[22:17:56] <zweb> so I could set the image strings to whatever attribute fairly easily
[22:18:31] <ch3mical> In other words, however you're determining the form is ready to be submitted (clicking a submit button or whatever) at that point get the data URI value and make it the value of the hidden field and submit the form
[22:18:58] <zweb> <input type="hidden" name="key_name" value="img_str" />?
[22:20:16] <ch3mical> in jQuery you could do this like $('<input/>',{type:'hidden',name:'signature',value: return getSignature()}).appendTo('form').submit()
[22:20:19] <zweb> I can change the hidden inputs when they save their signature I think
[22:20:37] <zweb> http://dpaste.com/694593/
[22:21:12] <ch3mical> Or if you already define the hidden input, just do $('#signatureInput').val(signatureDataURI) and submit the form
[22:21:24] <zweb> thanks I know this stuff is simple but saved me a good amount of time appreciate it
[22:21:37] <ch3mical> No worries man
[22:24:22] <opius>     $(':image').attr('src', $(this).attr('src').replace('', 'a')); ?
[22:24:29] <opius> what's wrong here
[22:24:34] <opius> ?
[22:31:06] <ch3mical> opius: my gut tells me your problem is somewhere around "this"
[22:31:25] <ch3mical> opius: if you replace "this" with ":image" does it work?
[22:34:24] <kaneda^> hey guys, i'm trying to use jquery tabs, and then i'm alaso trying a method i found on flowplayer, but neither work
[22:34:44] <kaneda^> http://jsfiddle.net/77KGy/1/ <-- this is a jsfiddle for the exact example given by flowplayer, and as yuo can see it doesn't work, can anyone tell me why?
[22:36:46] <opius> ch3mical:
[22:37:10] <opius> yes, but then all my images is beeing replaced. not only the ones with src=""
[22:38:13] <kaneda^> nvm, i fixed it
[22:41:36] <joshualibrarian> just changing the SRC tag of an image SHOULD cause it to reload, right?  do I need to call an event?
[22:43:15] <ch3mical> opius: ok, so can you put a class on only the ones you want changed/
[22:43:16] <ch3mical> ?
[22:43:46] <coldhead> joshualibrarian: if you do it right it should reload, yes
[22:43:59] <ch3mical> joshualibrarian: it's better to just replace the whole img tag
[22:44:06] <ch3mical> imho
[22:44:56] <joshualibrarian> hm... the images are about to come into view so I'm replacing the src tags with the actual images from stubs for on demand image loading... the src tag changes, the images don't appear.  :(
[22:46:08] <ch3mical> Maybe try my suggestion?
[22:46:48] <opius>     $(':image').each(function () {         $(this).attr('src', $(this).attr('src').replace('', 'bsaknas2.png'));     });
[22:46:55] <opius> this seems to work sort of
[22:47:17] <opius> just that it replaces src even on the ones having src!=''
[22:48:09] <ch3mical> Right, so I'm saying just modify your html so that _only_ the ones you want changed have a class
[22:49:02] <ch3mical> Then instead of $(':image') do $('.onlyChangeThis')
[22:50:16] <opius> i can't have it like that
[22:50:23] <joshualibrarian> ch3mical: already only the ones I want are being affected, with my very clean little widget.
[22:50:32] <joshualibrarian> it seems to be functioning correctly and changing the src tags...
[22:50:51] <ch3mical> ok
[22:51:31] <Mage> man i was about to ask a question
[22:51:39] <Mage> but i read the documentation and figured it out
[22:51:39] <ch3mical> But then you got high?
[22:51:45] <ch3mical> Oh. Right.
[22:51:48] <ch3mical> Good work :)
[22:52:19] <Mage> apparently using .submit(); can give strange errors when you have properties that conflict with input types
[22:52:28] <Mage> property ids or names
[22:52:43] <ch3mical> Good to know
[22:52:44] <Mage> like, <input type="submit" name="submit" value="go"/> will not be nice.
[22:52:51] <Mage> indeed
[22:53:17] <spersaud> whats a good plugin for drop down menus ?
[22:53:29] <spersaud> or is there a good howto out there ?
[22:53:46] <spersaud> ie .. hide all divs .. cant believe how complicated this silly stuff is
[22:54:16] <muzone> spersaud: i use hoverIntent
[22:55:06] <spersaud> muzone: ok ..
[22:58:06] <opius> ch3mical: it works now :)
[22:58:09] <opius>     $(':image').each(function () {         console.log($(this).attr('src'));         if ($(this).attr('src') == '') {             $(this).attr('src', $(this).attr('src').replace('', 'Images/bsaknas2.png'));         }         else { }     });
[22:58:54] <muzone> surfdue: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/FEstp/1/
[22:59:19] <muzone> spersaud:
[22:59:40] <muzone> spersaud: the stuff in "Set the colors straight" and "Set the minimum width for the dropdowns" you can take out i guess
[23:00:40] <ch3mical> opius: nice work :)
[23:07:04] <spersaud> muzone: ?
[23:07:28] <muzone> spersaud: what?
[23:07:58] <muzone> spersaud: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/FEstp/1/
[23:07:59] <spersaud> muzone: what are you talking about ?
[23:08:10] <muzone> your dropdown my man!! :D
[23:10:10] <spersaud> muzone yes .. so I use this with a ul of ul list ?
[23:10:31] <spersaud> I dont even know what Set the colors straight and set the minimum width is ???
[23:11:31] <muzone> as i said
[23:11:50] <muzone> you can take those parts out, they're just css customizations
[23:12:15] <spersaud> muzone: from where ?
[23:12:41] <spersaud> muzone: are we on the same page ?
[23:12:46] <spersaud> muzone: http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html ??
[23:13:43] <muzone> spersaud: from the JS i gave you in that fiddle
[23:13:47] <muzone> yes we are on that same page
[23:13:55] <muzone> * yes we are on the same page
[23:14:28] <spersaud> muzone: THANKS !!
[23:15:36] <muzone> anytime!
[23:16:56] <spersaud> oh I see you said surfdue first ..
[23:17:11] <muzone> yeah
[23:17:17] <muzone> slip of the finger there
[23:19:04] <Xedecimal> if I'm dynamically generating content via ajax or such, how would I go about calling $('element').button(); ? Normally I'd just do something like $('.button').button(); as .button should in my mind logically already be classed as such but this makes it easier, however the requirement to run a function on things just to class them makes it much more complicated like when I have a running log...
[23:19:05] <Xedecimal> ...of entries coming out of something, I don't want to run button on every line, just have the buttons classed
[23:22:08] <Xedecimal> ok, nevermind, I'm just gonna write my own css and it'll just plain work with .button from the getgo
[23:31:55] <spersaud> muzone: "color": "#000"<ul id="main-menu"> ??
[23:32:04] <spersaud> where does this property list start and end ?
[23:32:20] <spersaud> I am getting errors in the console
