[01:20:01] <shoky> `demo @ devslash
[01:20:02] <b-ot> devslash: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:45:02] <JohnnyCache> how do i get all the data-info of all the selected elements into array/string?
[01:45:37] <JohnnyCache> like: allPl = $("#fieldTable").find(".onField").data("playerinfo"); ->> return: "player1,player2,player3"
[01:46:17] <shoky> ?map
[01:46:18] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[01:47:19] <shoky> JohnnyCache ^
[01:47:30] <JohnnyCache> i saw that, i just dont understand how to use it :X
[01:47:45] <JohnnyCache> n/m
[01:47:47] <JohnnyCache> thanks :)
[01:48:07] <shoky> var allPl = $("#fieldTable").find(".onField").map(function() { return $(this).data("playerinfo") }).get();
[01:49:37] <communist-cake> Guys I have a tooltip problem
[01:49:43] <JohnnyCache> + thanks!
[01:50:05] <communist-cake> http://test.mrowa.topdivision.pl/QE/7/t.html on a test page everything is fine
[01:50:37] <communist-cake> but http://test.mrowa.topdivision.pl/QE/7/index.html here (left sidebar) and in File>Storage tooltips behave weird
[01:52:27] <communist-cake> :'(
[01:54:41] <shoky> communist-cake: #blanket is covering your whole page
[01:55:02] <communist-cake> yes, but is the issue?
[01:55:09] <shoky> it's one of the issues
[01:55:22] <communist-cake> blanket was supposed to work as background opacity of popups
[01:55:41] <communist-cake> but I cannot get it to be working, so it just lays there
[01:55:59] <shoky> if it covers the whole page, no hovers will get triggered for elements beneath it
[01:57:19] <communist-cake> But... its display is set to none
[01:58:36] <communist-cake> and tooltips ARE displayed
[01:58:42] <communist-cake> but in a wrong place
[01:59:28] <shoky> communist-cake: its display is not set to none.. here at least
[01:59:51] <shoky> #blanket {position:fixed;top:0%;left:0%;width:100%;height:100%;opacity:0;background:black;}
[02:00:52] <communist-cake> http://test.mrowa.topdivision.pl/QE/7/t.jpg it is the problem
[02:01:05] <communist-cake> in each case cursor is over the tooltip triggerer
[02:03:35] <shoky> communist-cake: you're not considering the scrolling of the page. notice how the position changes if you scroll
[02:04:09] <communist-cake> shoky: Oh.
[02:04:25] <shoky> since its position:absolute and the offset-parent is <body>  it will set the top/left that you put there as offset from the <body> elements top-left corner
[02:04:45] <communist-cake> shoky: I use tooltip and jQuery for the first time. I just copied this tutorial: http://robertmatuszewski.pl/blog/programowanie/prosty-tooltip-w-jquery-css/
[02:05:22] <communist-cake> Do you know where may I find some tooltip tutorial which will work in my case with position absolute and fixed?
[02:05:56] <communist-cake> Any good tutorials to recommend?
[02:06:33] <shoky> communist-cake: donno any tooltip tutorial, sry
[02:06:49] <communist-cake> :(
[02:07:03] <communist-cake> don't you have some magics on this channel?
[02:07:10] <communist-cake> `tooltip @ communist-cake
[02:07:14] <communist-cake> !tooltip @ communist-cake
[02:07:16] <communist-cake> :(
[02:07:23] <shoky> communist-cake: jquery-ui has a tooltip component. not a tutorial to build one tho
[02:07:50] <shoky> http://jqueryui.com/tooltip
[02:09:12] <communist-cake> shoky: I saw this one, but I am a noob, and inserting anything into title="" does not work (for example <b>)
[02:12:05] <shoky> communist-cake: yeah to put your custom html content you need to use the 'content' option (and probably the 'items' too)
[02:12:24] <shoky> see the custom-content example
[02:17:23] <communist-cake> shoky: thanks :)

[02:34:59] <tasuki> hello, how to test for object equivalence in qunit?
[02:39:34] <Eviltwin> tasuki: Depends on the kind of equivalence you're interested in. Look at: http://api.qunitjs.com/category/assert/
[02:41:47] <tasuki> Eviltwin, I'm interested in this kind of equivalence: equal({x: 'y'}, {x: 'y'})
[02:42:03] <tasuki> but equal compares with == so this won't work
[02:42:19] <Eviltwin> Then maybe look at the other options there?
[02:42:26] <Eviltwin> And click on them to learn more
[02:46:22] <tasuki> right, thanks
[03:11:50] <StephenS> one question, I have modal, but it works only on new div click and its not in the same line as it should be

[03:17:29] <StephenS> solved
[04:54:02] <io_____> hi how to change the duration of the animation in the accordionwidget?
[04:54:31] <io_____> i see some reference to the animate property but I can see an "animated" property in a plugin I am using
[05:35:56] <TelFiRE> I am using jQuery MixItUp and though my buttons work and I can see it animate and filter/sort properly, it immediately snaps back to the original view afterwards. Any ideas how I could troubleshoot this?
[05:37:53] <TelFiRE> ah it was a css issue my bad :p
[05:38:49] <azazel91> after i added the autocomplete script it worked perfect but it shows the number of results anybody know of a way to disable this message
[06:02:13] <Iszak> azazel91 what plugin are you using?
[06:02:43] <azazel91> your replying to the old question i asked!
[06:03:08] <azazel91> ?
[06:09:19] <Iszak> azazel91 I didn't see it.
[06:10:29] <azazel91> nevermind that i fixed that but how do i change the autocomplete styles with css
[06:11:10] <Iszak> azazel91 I don't even know what plugin you're using, hence is why I asked.
[06:11:50] <azazel91> im not using a plugin im using the embeded javascript code
[06:11:59] <aladdinwang> how to use different version of jquery in one page?
[06:12:25] <Iszak> aladdinwang you really shouldn't, but if you must, ?see noconflict
[06:12:30] <Iszak> ?noconflict @ aladdinwang
[06:12:36] <Iszak> hmm, t-bot?
[06:12:46] <Iszak> aladdinwang http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[06:13:41] <aladdinwang> Iszak: I want to develop based on django-admin, django-cms, they use jQuery1.4 and JQuery UI 1.7
[06:14:15] <aladdinwang> Iszak: and i can't find the jquery api for these version...
[06:14:45] <jastor> aladdinwang, Update to newer versions?
[06:15:09] <aladdinwang> Iszak: also I will so feature or JQuery plugin the newest jquery offered...
[06:15:49] <aladdinwang> jastor: The latest version of django-cms, just use jquery ui 1.7, :)
[06:15:51] <BeerSerc> Hi there. In a script to make image which link to itself zoom on click, I am using var imageLinks = $('a[href$=".png"], a[href$=".jpg"], a[href$=".gif"], a[href$=".bmp"]');. Now that breaks non-image links to images. Is there a way to get only <a><img></img></a> links?
[06:15:51] <Iszak> aladdinwang the documentation indicates when the API was introduced, I highly recommend you do not do this.
[06:16:13] <Hopsy> hey how can I select all childrens only: http://jsfiddle.net/bvsTg/7/
[06:16:20] <jastor> aladdinwang, Yes?
[06:16:51] <jastor> aladdinwang, I dont see how that prevents you from updating to a newer version
[06:16:57] <[E]sc> is there any way to clear the information inside the FormData?
[06:17:39] <Hopsy> [E]sc: yes
[06:17:49] <aladdinwang> $('#placeholder-38').closest('fieldset').dialog(), doesn't work for jquery ui 1.7?
[06:18:19] <Iszak> aladdinwang the dialog may have not been introduced in 1.7<
[06:18:43] <Iszak> aladdinwang I was mistaken, it was added on 1.0
[06:18:48] <Hopsy> [E]sc: http://jsfiddle.net/xavi3r/D3prt/
[06:18:51] <aladdinwang> jastor: but how?
[06:19:10] <jastor> aladdinwang, Just replace the files and edit the djangosource accordingly?
[06:19:29] <aladdinwang> the author of django-cms, written lots of js code based jquery 1.4 and jquery ui 1.7, I dont want to touch them..
[06:19:51] <aladdinwang> jastor: I think its danger...
[06:20:17] <aladdinwang> jastor: its dangerous..
[06:20:52] <aladdinwang> here is my code.... see show_placeholder function..
[06:22:50] <aladdinwang> http://bpaste.net/show/Jt7MG5yOXrdmwokHd5OY/
[06:26:52] <[E]sc> thanks Hopsy ... i'll have a look
[06:27:12] <Hopsy> how can I select all childrens only: http://jsfiddle.net/bvsTg/7/ :/
[06:30:11] <walidvb> hi guys!
[06:30:50] <walidvb> im using this exact code on a website, but i get a 'can't call method getJSON of undefined'...
[06:30:51] <walidvb> http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/cDqJU/
[06:32:51] <walidvb> and the website: http://vbbros.net/mjc
[06:33:34] <walidvb> i still don't know how to debug js, unfortunately. don't know how to insert break points or so.. which is problematic with a minimised library..
[06:33:38] <Hopsy> walidvb: wtf that bannerrr
[06:33:46] <walidvb> Hopsy: dev site, sorry :D
[06:34:08] <walidvb> act i'm upgrading an existing site, and more or less only the player is missing
[06:37:45] <Hopsy> walidvb: this is the problem <script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.official.fm/api/player1.0.js"></script>
[06:38:01] <walidvb> Hopsy: aha.
[06:39:02] <Hopsy> walidvb: http://puu.sh/3bLJ0/e3428704c8.png
[06:39:07] <walidvb> i'm sorry, i don't see the prob
[06:39:17] <Hopsy> I think you are using the older version of jquery
[06:39:23] <Hopsy> you are using drupal right?
[06:39:27] <walidvb> Hopsy: yup
[06:39:50] <Hopsy> you can upgrade your jquery
[06:39:54] <walidvb> hm in the fiddle i'm using the same version
[06:40:37] <Hopsy> version 1.4.4 ?
[06:40:39] <walidvb> and officialfm doesn't stte any reqs(but they suck, to be honest..)
[06:40:42] <walidvb> Hopsy: yes
[06:41:02] <Hopsy> hmmz
[06:41:58] <azazel91> can somebody help me make the autocomplete display the keywords 4 times on thedropdown
[06:42:46] <boytoy> Can somebody help me pause this slider of kittens if the current slide has data-kitten="pause"? http://jsfiddle.net/7n3GC/1/
[06:42:54] <Hopsy> walidvb: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7975093/typeerror-undefined-is-not-a-function-evaluating-document
[06:43:32] <Hopsy> I think its a drupal conflict
[06:44:39] <walidvb> Hopsy: sry brb, i'll look at that link now
[06:49:43] <walidvb> Hopsy: hm, i had this in the past, but on the old version of the website, with jquery 1.3.3 or smth.
[06:52:12] <walidvb> Hopsy: but i call OfficialFM on a 1.4.4 object
[06:52:25] <SrPx> Can I query elements that have certain data defined? $('[data-foo=anything_but_undefined]')
[06:52:41] <gry> i have a js Object {'*':'foo'}, how do i access the value?
[06:53:02] <gry> myobj.* says missing name after .
[06:53:28] <walidvb> SrPx: $('[data-foo=*]'), no?
[06:53:53] <SrPx> walidvb: I thought that could conflict with data that is actually a * . But let me try
[06:54:05] <walidvb> hm check the doc, then
[06:54:52] <gry> oops, i think http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7610191/json-access-field-named-asterisk answers my question
[06:58:11] -walidvb- Yucky name for an object member.
[06:58:13] <walidvb> gry:  ;)
[06:58:43] <Multiply> Oh god. :|

[07:02:11] <jammsen> and why did you notice me?!
[07:02:16] <jammsen> just ask in the channel

[07:24:47] <Rockwood> really no error reporting anywhere
[07:25:28] <Rockwood> i checked mozilla and firebug console but not any there in both

[07:29:56] <walidvb> Rockwood: i don't, really.

[07:32:17] <walidvb> Rockwood: ^
[07:33:40] <Rockwood> Thanks walidcb
[07:33:52] <Rockwood> and dabear
[07:34:30] <walidvb> Rockwood: yw
[07:38:33] <aladdinwang> see, <li><a href="javascript:show_placeholder()" class="previewdraftlink">Edit Placeholder</a></li>
[07:46:35] <walidvb> i'm still stuck on my conflict problem. Got this code working fine on jsfiddle, breaking on my site... http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/cDqJU/ http://vbbros.net/mjc
[07:48:12] <walidvb> Hopsy: just saw that it runs fine when ran from console (without the click event)
[07:53:06] <dabear> walidvb: the player.js file tries to call $.getJSON and complains that $ does not exist.
[07:53:16] <dabear> e.g. jquery is not loaded
[07:53:21] <dabear> for some reason
[07:54:17] <dabear> walidvb: you should try to load jquery as the first thing you do, then load player.js
[07:54:34] <walidvb> dabear: i see that, but i print $().jquery and it works
[07:54:51] <walidvb> aha. right. weird, but let me check if it does indeed come from that
[07:56:54] <walidvb> dabear: but official is loaded after jquery... jquery is the first thing loaded
[07:57:06] <walidvb> and my script the last
[07:57:43] <dabear> walidvb: 1) beautify your player code, 2) check the console for errors, set a breakpoint on the error line and check if $ is available
[07:57:48] <dabear> inside the breakpoint
[07:57:51] <dabear> e.g. https://www.evernote.com/shard/s204/sh/5ff7c717-574e-4d08-85e5-b6fcbcf979e7/11d3858ee468de407bd8c9efd8fe6a62/deep/0/Screenshot%2009.06.13%2016:55.jpg
[07:58:28] <walidvb> dabear: cheers, not so familiar with js debugger yet
[08:00:34] <dabear> walidvb: first start with an unminified version of player.js
[08:02:03] <walidvb> dabear: yeah.. i don't have that... :( fyi, running the code from within the console works just fine
[08:02:09] <dabear> indeed $ is undefined there
[08:02:16] <dabear> I just checked
[08:02:20] <dabear> does not work
[08:02:23] <walidvb> dabear: thanks
[08:02:40] <dabear> you should run the code in the console only when the breakpoint is triggered
[08:02:43] <walidvb> there, it's undefined(drupal way of handling stuff. jQuery does exist)
[08:02:51] <walidvb> dabear: ok
[08:02:58] <dabear> the console will have the same context as the breakpoint has
[08:03:01] <Rockwood> another problem
[08:03:51] <dabear> walidvb: quick and dirty fix, try to wrap the entire player.js in a function
[08:03:54] <dabear> e.g.
[08:04:21] <walidvb> (function($){ all_code}(jQuery)
[08:04:23] <dabear> (function($){  /* player.js contents here*/})(jQuery)
[08:04:24] <walidvb> ?
[08:04:31] <dabear> yep
[08:04:34] <Rockwood> http://paste.adamboxall.com/97       and   http://paste.adamboxall.com/96
[08:04:38] <walidvb> dabear: exactly. ok, i'll try that.

[08:16:25] <Rockwood> http://fixee.org/paste/5woj4j3/
[08:16:26] <dabear> I see no fiddle
[08:16:31] <dabear> it is not runnable
[08:16:53] <Rockwood> <b-ot> Rockwood: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:17:08] <Rockwood> so i used
[08:17:12] <dabear> see that preffered part
[08:17:18] <dabear> it is preferred for a reason
[08:17:38] <Rockwood>  http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred]
[08:17:51] <Rockwood> but once see dat
[08:18:02] <Rockwood> bcz i am doing on two page s
[08:18:18] <Rockwood> after it it is easy to get the mean of dat
[08:19:38] <dabear> if the code is not easy for me to run rigth away, it means I have to create my own site, upload the files and link them together and reproduce YOUR errors
[08:19:43] <dabear> too much work
[08:20:49] <Rockwood> http://jsfiddle.net/rockwood/UrRDX/
[08:20:52] <Rockwood> dabear
[08:21:26] <Rockwood> now you can check easliy
[08:21:36] <dabear> nope
[08:21:44] <dabear> still not runnable*
[08:21:51] <dabear> -*
[08:22:08] <Rockwood> but i did it in fine way
[08:22:10] <dabear> check the debug console
[08:22:14] <Rockwood> where is the mistake
[08:22:34] <dabear> in the console you'd find it
[08:22:56] <Rockwood> first onlad is working fine for without any error
[08:22:57] <dabear> can't have embedded php code

[08:24:23] <Krambiorix> hi, how can i make a jquery object of   this ?
[08:24:44] <dabear> Krambiorix: $(this)
[08:26:48] <Krambiorix> dabear, thanks!
[08:27:14] <Rockwood> dabear it excutable
[08:27:25] <Krambiorix> dabear, and how can i get the document of $(this) ?
[08:27:39] <Krambiorix> i tried with $(this).find("document")  but the length of that is 0
[08:28:57] <dabear> Krambiorix: find works down, parent/parents or preferably closest() works UP. that said, you don't need jquery to get the nodes accociated document
[08:29:42] <dabear> this.ownerDocument and this.ownerDocument.documentElement might be what you're looking after, Krambiorix
[08:31:52] <Krambiorix> dabear, i want to find an element with id "myinput" ... even with this.ownerDocument.documentElement i can 't find it
[08:33:05] <dabear> Krambiorix: my car is having some problems, even by looking at the body I can't find the problem!
[08:33:49] <dabear> e.g. your question is too weak, I can't locate the problem for you without any more info
[08:35:05] <Krambiorix> dabear, in my document i have an input element with id "myinput" . In a script i have this var to get the input... I tried $(this).find("#myinput") to get that element... But that returns undefined....
[08:35:28] <dabear> Krambiorix: IDs are unique
[08:35:34] <Krambiorix> dabear, yes
[08:35:39] <dabear> $("#myinput")
[08:35:48] <sunbeam> when i .click(function()  a link i want a dialog like alert() where the user can input a password
[08:35:51] <sunbeam> how is this possible?
[08:35:53] <sunbeam> any ide
[08:36:21] <Rockwood>  http://jsfiddle.net/rockwood/UrRDX/4/
[08:36:23] <Rockwood> now
[08:36:31] <Rockwood> why it is not working ?
[08:36:34] <dabear> sunbeam: http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-form
[08:36:54] <Krambiorix> dabear, i put the element in the wrong document. I'm so sorry for your time... It's solved now
[08:37:04] <dabear> :)
[08:38:29] <Rockwood> no error showing  now but it is not executing
[08:38:48] <Rockwood> dabear   http://jsfiddle.net/rockwood/UrRDX/4/
[08:39:15] <Rockwood> dabear i remved all php
[08:39:25] <dabear> Rockwood: still not runnable
[08:39:28] <Rockwood> removed *
[08:39:32] <dabear> jquery not loaded
[08:40:08] <dabear> sorry, but im off, c ya
[08:40:09] <Krambiorix> dabear, another question ... data.files  has 3 objects. I want to make it contain only the first object. Is it ok to do it like this: data.files = data.files[0];   ?
[08:40:14] <Hopsy> how can I call this function: 'document.body.addEventListener(' from an iframe?
[08:40:45] <Hopsy> I have tried $('#frame').contents().addEventlistener
[08:40:58] <Hopsy> I have tried $('#frame').contents().body.addEventlistener
[08:41:13] <dabear> Krambiorix: yep, however, you would also have changed datatype of data.files from an array of files to just a file now
[08:41:13] <Hopsy> it didnt work for me
[08:41:45] <Rockwood> dabear once can you check it please
[08:41:51] <Rockwood> i have small code
[08:42:26] <Rockwood> b-ot
[08:44:02] <Krambiorix> dabear, hmmm how can i keep it as an array?
[08:47:03] <Krambiorix> dabear i did it like : var f = [];	f.push(data.files[0]);	data.files = f; and that works... Maybe a little detour :)

[09:20:50] <Rockwood> i did
[09:26:55] <sunbeam> dabear: isn't there another way? I want the same popup as on an htaccess password
[09:27:56] <Rockwood_> jindmind
[09:27:59] <sunbeam> I'd like to know if it's possible to simulate a alert() a like popup with a password
[09:28:03] <sunbeam> Anyone knows of such?
[09:28:19] <Rockwood_> http://jsfiddle.net/rockwood/xmCJV/
[09:28:57] <Rockwood_> i am unable to run this code
[09:29:06] <Rockwood_> somebody can hep me in this
[09:29:11] <Rockwood_> ????????????????
[09:29:35] <_rgn> step 1. learn html
[09:29:51] <Rockwood_> me ?
[09:30:09] <Rockwood_> yes i know html
[09:30:49] <_rgn> if you say so
[09:31:09] <Rockwood_> but i know html why you said this ?
[09:31:15] <Rockwood_> any eoor seen
[09:31:19] <Rockwood_> error*
[09:32:09] <gordian> Rockwood_: if you know HTML then FIX the html on your fiddle
[09:34:50] <gordian> Rockwood_: but i suspect that your jQuery is not working because you're not passing any event to your click function
[09:34:59] <gordian> in fact i don't suspect, i KNOW
[09:35:22] <Rockwood_> just removed
[09:35:46] <Rockwood_> http://jsfiddle.net/rockwood/xmCJV/1/
[09:35:54] <Rockwood_> now check please
[09:36:18] <jedimind> if you submit the form, the page refreshes
[09:36:22] <jedimind> what are you triyng to do?
[09:36:37] <Nexen> dont use ugly single quote
[09:36:40] <gordian> Rockwood_: look at your console
[09:36:43] <Rockwood_> after submit i wanna use ajax
[09:37:03] <gordian> Rockwood_: you're also not loading jQuery in your fiddle
[09:37:11] <Rockwood_> sorry set lib too now
[09:37:25] <Rockwood_> by mistake forget dat
[09:37:36] <Rockwood_> but set it now
[09:37:55] <Rockwood_> http://jsfiddle.net/rockwood/xmCJV/3/
[09:37:56] <_rgn> Rockwood_: you're trying to use `e` variable in the event listener, where do you see that variable defined?
[09:38:19] <Rockwood_> ohh my god i need to remove
[09:38:49] <Rockwood_> http://jsfiddle.net/rockwood/xmCJV/4/
[09:38:49] <gordian> ok now that you loaded jQuery look at your console message
[09:38:52] <gordian> "Uncaught ReferenceError: e is not defined "
[09:39:03] <Rockwood_> yes
[09:39:09] <Rockwood_> but i remove dat now
[09:39:11] <_rgn> hahaha
[09:39:16] <Rockwood_> removed e var
[09:39:28] <gordian> you don't need to remove it
[09:39:35] <gordian> the problem is that it's not defined
[09:39:37] <Rockwood_> then ?
[09:39:45] <gordian> it's not defined because you're not passing it to the event handler
[09:39:58] <gordian> watch how it's done: http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[09:41:15] <_rgn> what do you think you're doing when you're just calling "preventDefault()"?
[09:41:18] <Koopz> aloha... does anyone know a WYSIWYG Form Builder plugin? I'm not looking for a website to build forms... i want my users to build them on my site
[09:41:28] <_rgn> don't just do stuff randomly without understanding it
[09:41:32] <Rockwood_> just call without variable
[09:41:40] <_rgn> it's called cargo cult programming
[09:41:50] <Rockwood_> variable not improtant for me there
[09:42:00] <_rgn> clearly you don't know what's important
[09:42:01] <gordian> Rockwood_: you can't just call a method
[09:42:07] <gordian> that's like calling hide();
[09:42:17] <jedimind> Rockwood_: you obviously dont understand very basic javascript / jquery, you should maybe invest a day or so of your time to learn some of the basics
[09:42:27] <Rockwood_> yes
[09:42:34] <gordian> jQuery needs to know WHAT to hide, just like in your example jQuery needs to know what to prevent
[09:42:40] <Rockwood_> i am very weak in javascript
[09:42:49] <gordian> click that bloody link i pasted mate
[09:42:57] <jedimind> lol gordian
[09:42:59] <gordian> that example is exactly for you
[09:43:23] <jedimind> "cant someone just do it for me?!"
[09:43:46] <Koopz> + "for free"
[09:43:53] <gordian> + "with a smile"
[09:43:57] <Rockwood_> i know only few thing like when a user click
[09:43:58] <Rockwood_> onload
[09:44:20] <jedimind> so, maybe, it would stand to reason to click on the link that gordian gave you so that you can spend 3 minutes reading it and hopefully learn it
[09:44:23] <_rgn> step 1. understand what event.method() notation means, step 2. understand what the event callback is and what the arguments are, step 3. understand what calling preventDefault() on an event does
[09:44:24] <Rockwood_> yes
[09:44:25] <jedimind> rather than talking to us for 3 hours
[09:44:56] <gordian> Rockwood_: if you had read that link you would know the solution by now
[09:45:02] <gordian> …or you would be able to ask intelligent questions
[09:45:16] <gordian> so hop to it cowboy!
[09:45:49] <_rgn> i don't see this on other channels but here the attitude seems to be that newbies roll their face on the keyboard every time they try to solve a problem and then throw their code here and ask what's wrong
[09:45:56] <jedimind> i feel like that statement might be insulting to cowboys
[09:46:12] <Koopz> *g*
[09:46:27] <gordian> i feel like cowboys should be insulted at every opportunity
[09:46:59] <Rockwood_> who is cowboy ?
[09:46:59] <gordian> _rgn: it happens on most open source chans
[09:47:29] <gordian> var Rockwood_ = 'cowboy'
[09:47:44] <Rockwood_> lol
[09:47:50] <Rockwood_> i am feeling well now
[09:48:23] <jedimind> the fever has broken, has it ?
[09:49:23] <Rockwood> buddies
[09:49:42] <Koopz> so... does anyone know a WYSIWYG Form Builder plugin? I'm not looking for a website to build forms... i want my users to build them on my site
[09:50:18] <gordian> Koopz: instead of repeating your question why don't you google it
[09:50:24] <gordian> …i just did and found at least 10 of them
[09:50:40] <Koopz> well i wouldn't be here if i wouldn't have done it already ;)
[09:51:10] <Rockwood> http://jsfiddle.net/rockwood/xmCJV/6/      it is working here
[09:51:23] <Koopz> and still I am looking for a plugin to implement it on my website
[09:51:28] <Rockwood> but when i am using it in to my code
[09:51:43] <Rockwood> it is not working
[09:51:44] <jedimind> $("#usefists").submit(); is not doing anything
[09:51:51] <jedimind> because your form doesnt have that ID
[09:51:58] <jedimind> furthermore, if it did have that ID, then it would submit the form prior to the alert happening
[09:52:08] <Rockwood> id havin in
[09:52:20] <Rockwood> ID having in i tink
[09:52:23] <Rockwood> think
[09:52:44] <Rockwood> id = 'submit'
[09:52:46] <_rgn> wrong: <form name = 'usefists' method = 'post'> right: <form name='usefists' method='post'> and most people prefer double quotes (")
[09:53:21] <Rockwood> due to php i need to use single quotes
[09:53:29] <_rgn> no you don't
[09:53:32] <gordian> pfft
[09:53:47] <gordian> this is better than the comedian i saw last night
[09:53:58] <Rockwood> okay trying with php in my code
[09:54:12] <Rockwood> i make it simple html there
[09:54:18] <Koopz> gordian: I don't want my users to build forms on other websites...
[09:54:56] <_rgn> Koopz: i found this http://botsko.net/Demos/formbuilder/
[09:56:20] <gordian> Koopz: you might also check out codecanyon
[10:02:08] <Rockwood> http://picpaste.com/screenshot-BNLfgyND.jpg
[10:02:16] <Koopz> _rgn: thanks for that one...it will probably fit my needs
[10:02:34] <Rockwood> after double same as it is
[10:04:22] <Rockwood> still the same for me
[10:04:52] <Rockwood> basic concept is working fine in http://jsfiddle.net/rockwood/xmCJV/6/
[10:05:07] <Rockwood> but in real code it is not working for me
[10:05:49] <dabear> sunbeam: regarding popups, you can't have custom browser modal dialogs in js. there's jquery ui dialog and prompt() though
[10:06:13] <Koopz> Rockwood: your form is lacking the id-attribute
[10:06:29] * jedimind facepalms
[10:06:36] <_rgn> Rockwood: do you understand what "#usefists" means
[10:06:43] <dabear> Rockwood: not figured it out YET
[10:06:44] <dabear> lol
[10:06:49] <Koopz> name != id
[10:06:50] <Rockwood> this form id
[10:06:56] <Rockwood> okay
[10:07:04] <Rockwood> chking
[10:07:23] <jedimind> im going to #usefists in a minute
[10:07:32] <Koopz> funny that his elements have ids...
[10:07:35] <dabear> btw, a form submit would redirect you to another page
[10:07:46] <dabear> so code below submit() would not run
[10:07:59] <Rockwood> wb dabear
[10:08:14] <dabear> and why aren't you doing input type="submit" instead?
[10:08:29] <dabear> and why are you using single quotes in your html?
[10:08:51] <dabear> this seems like a copy & paste without any knowledge on what's going on
[10:09:11] <Koopz> it is...
[10:09:32] <Rockwood> i converted all single quotes in to double
[10:10:34] <_rgn> logic and problem solving skills are the cornerstone of programming ability and this guy has absolutely none
[10:10:49] <Pavlov> heh
[10:11:08] <dabear> Rockwood: your problem can be summed up with the following illustration:
[10:11:11] <dabear> http://iwantmoar.com/2783
[10:11:21] <sacho> eh
[10:11:51] <Rockwood> lol
[10:12:02] <Rockwood> i good in html
[10:12:22] <Rockwood> very less k now about javascript
[10:13:01] <Koopz> as long as you know that php code only works if your file extension is "php" or "phtml"...
[10:13:11] <Rockwood> actually my old code was working old time ajax
[10:13:19] <jedimind> old time ajax is the best time
[10:13:34] * jedimind pictures ajax with a cane and a shitty cough brought on from years of smoking
[10:14:01] <Rockwood> no
[10:14:04] <dabear> so most old people=smokers?
[10:14:23] <Rockwood> http://paste.adamboxall.com/8f    i m trying to replace this
[10:14:39] <Rockwood> with jquery
[10:15:01] <jedimind> dabear: i just figure the stress that ajax has been under all these years forced it to chain smoke
[10:15:19] <dabear> ah, seems legit
[10:15:38] <Rockwood> dabear and jedimind
[10:15:45] <Rockwood> you know php too?
[10:15:46] <jedimind> yes, my child?
[10:15:50] <jedimind> php and i go way back
[10:15:59] <jedimind> we used to shoot wombats together
[10:16:21] <Koopz> do you even framework, dude?
[10:16:23] <dabear> me and php were lovers, actually
[10:16:33] <Rockwood> php can do like ajax
[10:16:37] <Rockwood> can't
[10:16:50] <jedimind> dabear: SO YOURE THE BASTARD!
[10:16:54] <Koopz> PHP can't do Javascript either...
[10:17:05] <Rockwood> yes
[10:17:07] <Koopz> also PHP can't html
[10:17:13] <Rockwood> php having less
[10:17:13] <jedimind> Koopz: so what you're saying is my car cant piano?
[10:17:15] <Koopz> 'cause php is php
[10:17:21] <dabear> but then during the php 5 transformations, php fell in love with classes instead of me :( :(
[10:17:31] <Rockwood> no one can replace html
[10:17:49] <Rockwood> 5 is bit better
[10:17:49] <Koopz> jedimind: as long as your car isn't some weird mutated thing, yes
[10:17:58] <Rockwood> PDO made nice now
[10:18:16] <jedimind> fuck me im laughing so hard
[10:18:23] <Rockwood> mysql was horrible thing in php
[10:18:51] <jedimind> mysql is the worst thing that happened to php since latisha
[10:18:54] <jedimind> that bitch was cray cray
[10:19:26] <Rockwood> but PDO is very better option php
[10:20:10] <Rockwood> pps you seen my code ?
[10:20:14] <Pavlov> php2 was the best
[10:20:18] <Rockwood> old ajax code
[10:20:33] <Rockwood> php2
[10:20:40] <Rockwood> i dont know about dat
[10:20:41] <dabear> PDO short for pedo(phile)?
[10:20:58] <_rgn> having seen your html/js let's not go to php lol
[10:21:10] <Pavlov> lol
[10:21:35] <dabear> haha, _rgn good one
[10:25:39] <Rockwood> PHP Data Objects (PDO)
[10:27:28] <Rockwood> dabear how can make it working jquery my old ajax code
[10:27:56] <Rockwood> how can improve my code ?
[10:28:05] <Rockwood> how can i*
[10:28:23] <Rockwood> jedimind
[10:28:30] <jedimind> yes my dear
[10:28:33] <jedimind> well
[10:28:47] <Rockwood> i tried lots of thing
[10:28:53] <jedimind> first, you have to buy some books, then invest a considerable amount of time to learning said books
[10:29:06] <jedimind> then over a period of ac ouple of years, start applying your code to increasingly more difficult situations and problems
[10:29:19] <jedimind> and after that period of time, you should have better code
[10:30:01] <Rockwood> right now no possiblity ?
[10:30:35] <jedimind> given what ive seen that you (dont) know, not really
[10:31:05] <Rockwood> yes i am accepting
[10:31:25] * jedimind hugs Rockwood 
[10:31:27] <jedimind> it'll be okay buddy
[10:31:58] * Rockwood hugs jedimind
[10:32:01] <jedimind> you're in new delhi right ?
[10:32:16] <Rockwood> yes
[10:32:17] <Rockwood> and you are ?
[10:32:19] <jedimind> i used to live in delhi
[10:32:25] <jedimind> im a white guy from canada, but i lived in delhi in 1989
[10:32:32] <jedimind> for 3 years
[10:32:38] <Rockwood> okay
[10:32:45] <Rockwood> was old one
[10:33:10] <Rockwood> now new delhi fully changed
[10:33:29] <jedimind> ive wanted to go back, but havent had the opportunity
[10:33:35] <jedimind> i used to live in greater kailash 2
[10:33:42] <Rockwood> yes
[10:33:52] <Rockwood> it near by my house
[10:33:57] <jedimind> my dad was the person who helped bring maruti suzuki to india
[10:34:03] <jedimind> he build the relationship between suzuki and maruti
[10:34:10] <jedimind> in 1987, and in 1989 they started making the first factories

[12:06:20] <Rashad> hey
[12:06:52] <Rashad> I want something that makes a box follow the insertion point.
[12:07:40] <Rashad> I don't know how to google that.
[12:08:21] <Rashad> ah wait
[12:08:48] <Rashad> I think I can do that not by determining the position of the insertion point, but by determining the position of the mouse when it clicks
[12:10:01] <Rashad> ok thanks Rashad
[12:10:04] <Rashad> you're welcome
[12:10:21] <jedimind> glad we could help

[12:43:06] <nastus> could anyone help me with the issue here? when you mouse over the box is supposed to move but it doesnt do anything http://jsfiddle.net/QX4Bc/
[12:44:30] <nathanr> anyone know if there is a way to get the start position of a <span> ?
[12:50:37] <nsanden> my brain isnt working, http://jsfiddle.net/KXdFq/1/ - please help
[12:52:46] <nastus> could anyone help me with the issue here? when you mouse over the box is supposed to move but it doesnt do anything http://jsfiddle.net/QX4Bc/1/

[13:00:41] <wjziv> Hi--I'm having an issue figuring out how to go about making a functional calendar? I got the layout I want, and I have the corresponding jQuery UI plug in, but I'm not sure how to take the bits of #calendar and transpose them on the layout I want them in.
[13:07:30] <wjziv> Anyone?
[13:09:18] <nastus> thats odd because I did load it in my code..
[13:45:20] <communist-cookie> Guys, you scroll a page down, yeah?
[13:45:41] <Ungy> wtf?
[13:45:51] <communist-cookie> And can you get how high is the part that is already scrolled (not visible, it is like above the viewport)
[13:46:00] <communist-cookie> I have troubles to define what I mean.
[13:46:20] <Ungy> obviously
[13:46:25] <communist-cookie> Ungy: understood or not?
[13:46:34] <Ungy> have no idea what you are asking
[13:46:44] <communist-cookie> uhm let me upload it.
[13:48:03] <_rgn> communist-cookie: $(window).scrollTop()
[13:48:05] <communist-cookie> Ungy: http://test.mrowa.topdivision.pl/QE/7/index.html#
[13:49:11] <communist-cookie> when you hover 'hover plz' on left, try scrolling down
[13:50:20] <Ungy> ok what ar e you asking?
[13:51:05] <communist-cookie> The problem is tooltip on blocks with position:fixed.
[13:51:30] <communist-cookie> When you scroll the page for example 100px to the bottom
[13:51:51] <communist-cookie> And thus 100px 'is gone on the top of the page'
[13:52:16] <communist-cookie> elements with position fixed stays in the same place
[13:52:26] <communist-cookie> but the tooltips are lowered 100px too
[13:52:33] <communist-cookie> how can I solve it?
[13:53:03] <communist-cookie> _rgn: $('#tooltip').css('top', e.pageY - $(window).scrollTop()); will do, you think?
[13:53:44] <_rgn> i don't know, your problem is confusing, poorly explained
[13:53:53] <Ungy> you lost me
[13:54:24] <_rgn> maybe you should start by explaining what you want to do, not by what you think the problem is
[13:54:28] <communist-cookie> _rgn: you helped me a lot :)
[13:54:32] <communist-cookie> it works :)
[13:55:04] <communist-cookie> I want to have a tooltip on an element which is contained in a div with position:fixed, which causes some troubles
[13:56:53] <Ungy> umm pading?
[13:57:02] <Ungy> or margin
[13:57:33] <communist-cookie> Problem is solved :)
[13:57:54] <Ungy> umm glad to hear
[13:57:59] <communist-cookie> No need to talk about it any more, sorry I explained it so badly and wasted your time :)
[13:58:15] * Ungy still trying to figure out what he was trying to do in the first place
[13:59:11] <communist-cookie> Look
[13:59:49] <communist-cookie> ELEMENT -> TOOLTIP //when $(window).scrollTop() === 0
[14:00:14] <communist-cookie> ELEMENT
[14:00:14] <communist-cookie> .
[14:00:14] <communist-cookie> .
[14:00:14] <communist-cookie> .
[14:00:14] <communist-cookie> -> TOOLTIP //when $(window).scrollTop() === 40
[14:00:42] <communist-cookie> whenever i scroll down, element stays in the previous page, but its tooltip is lowered
[14:01:36] <communist-cookie> Ungy: get it?
[14:02:11] <Ungy> umm no but that is OK i have things I have to do rather then trying to figure out what your doing
[14:02:46] <communist-cookie> No problem, I just tried to explain it again for you said 'Ungy still trying to figure out what he was trying to do in the first place'
[14:05:16] <communist-cookie> have a nice day guys :)
[14:06:46] <Ungy> you too
[14:30:55] <twb2> anyone seen a website based on this model or similar model? http://www.paulrhayes.com/2010-09/3d-css-cube-ii-touch-gestures-click-and-drag/
[14:37:31] <cariaso> http://promethease.com works well, but under https://promethease.com the ui looks wrong, and I don't understand why. "ReferenceError: $ is not defined" Can anyone clue me in?
[14:47:18] <lolmaus> I'm doing some AJAX. Is it possible to set the browser to a loading state?
[15:22:03] <samu> Hello everybody.
[15:22:23] <samu> My question will be a bit weird.
[15:22:40] <samu> Basically, I'm doing a remake of roundcube skin, which (afaik) uses jquery and jqueryui.
[15:23:08] <samu> it probably uses draggable binds for messagelist... but I don't want to modify roundcube core javascript (I want my modifications to be loadable as plugins)
[15:23:42] <samu> basically, I have two questions
[15:24:02] <samu> 1) is it possible to remove every single draggable bind in the document, without knowing to what has it been bound?
[15:24:14] <acidjazz> yes
[15:24:20] <acidjazz> unbind is global unless you specify a handler
[15:24:32] <samu> 2) is it possible to somehow bind to an existing function, so that some of my code would run just after that function?
[15:24:35] <acidjazz> as long as you can tie it to what it was bound to
[15:24:48] <acidjazz> binding does not unbind so yes
[15:24:54] <acidjazz> but i wouldnt recommend practicing that
[15:24:56] <acidjazz> too shady
[15:25:15] <samu> well basically the second question is about roundcube dynamic message loading
[15:25:31] <samu> it will create new nodes and new binds if the user loads the second page, for example.
[15:26:10] <MariusIT> guys, any ideea why siblings dosen't work outsite the current <div></div> container? http://pastebin.com/0NWTu7dq
[15:26:34] <samu> acidjazz: could you tell me more about unbinding every single draggable bind in the document please?
[15:27:02] <Eviltwin> I think $(":ui-draggable").draggable("destroy") should work
[15:27:11] <Eviltwin> But what'll happen there
[15:27:13] <samu> hm... lets see.
[15:27:21] <Eviltwin> Is it'll look at every element in the document
[15:27:24] <Eviltwin> See if it's a draggable
[15:27:30] <Eviltwin> And if it is destroy it
[15:27:37] <Kid_Matthew> Hello, Can some one here help/assist me?
[15:28:14] <Eviltwin> MariusIT: I don't quite understand the question. Can you make a jsFiddle demo (without the AJAX, that's irrelevant, I assume)
[15:28:16] <samu> hm.
[15:28:19] <Eviltwin> Kid_Matthew: Don't ask to ask, just ask
[15:28:26] <samu> $(":ui-draggable") returns me an empty list, thats weird
[15:28:43] <MariusIT> ok
[15:29:19] <Kid_Matthew> I have recently been trying to add http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyphoto-jquery-lightbox-clone/#prettyPhoto , to my website. and I'm having troubles with it idk what I'm doing wrong, i think it has to do with my jquery libraries
[15:34:46] <MariusIT> Eviltwin: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/AN6dB/ i can't make it work on jsfiddle, on localhost runs ok, the point is once you click features should slide only the current class and hide the others
[15:35:08] <MariusIT> it dosen't work if i add the first <div>
[15:35:16] <MariusIT> without it, works fine
[15:36:29] <Eviltwin> MariusIT: Is this what you were aiming for? http://jsfiddle.net/AN6dB/1/
[15:37:17] <MariusIT> Eviltwin: omg yes, but only one at a time
[15:40:07] <Eviltwin> MariusIT: http://jsfiddle.net/AN6dB/2/
[15:40:28] <Eviltwin> .siblings() only works within the same container
[15:40:31] <Eviltwin> That's sort of the point
[15:40:42] <MariusIT> Eviltwig: you sir, deserve a beer, cheers!
[15:41:06] <MariusIT> ah, i missed that
[15:53:14] <raj> how can I run jquery and a script on a 3rd party website?
[16:15:36] <Eviltwin> raj: You can't?
[16:26:57] <_rgn> yes you can, write a userscript
[16:44:56] <lenswipe> hey guys
[16:45:03] <lenswipe> i have a problem with $.slidedown
[16:45:04] <lenswipe> http://jsfiddle.net/PGWPc/1/
[16:45:20] <lenswipe> for some reason when I hover over the text under the image the element slides up and down repeatedly
[16:55:19] <_rgn> lenswipe: probably because the animation causes the event to trigger over and over
[17:01:01] <lenswipe> _rgn, how?
[17:02:08] <raj> Eviltwin, why not?
[17:02:11] <raj> what about greasemonkey
[17:05:59] <_rgn> raj: don't listen to him
[17:06:43] <_rgn> lenswipe: i don't know, there's something funny going on with slide{Up,Down}
[17:22:33] <BillCriswell_> Hmmm
[17:23:26] <BillCriswell> There we go.
[18:41:57] <tw2113> i suppose i shouldn't try to use node while i'm in the middle of updating it
[18:52:57] <shoky> be my guest, tw2113
[18:53:21] <tw2113> all i want is to get grunt-cli working *cries*
[18:53:38] <shoky> update taking so long?
[18:53:57] <tw2113> my output when i try to install https://gist.github.com/tw2113/5746054
[18:54:03] <tw2113> though we're off topic by a mile
[18:55:20] <shoky> ;[
[18:56:07] <shoky> isn't it GoT time for you anyway
[18:56:35] <tw2113> i don't have hbo, so i have to wing that *whistles*
[18:56:44] <shoky> ah
[18:57:18] <shoky> well.. same here ;p
[19:01:41] <michaelgamble> hey
[19:01:45] <vsync_> hiho
[19:01:50] <michaelgamble> anyone here familiar with bootstrap components
[19:02:14] <michaelgamble> I'm using query and bootstrap and trying to read the visible state of an accordion for an if statement
[19:02:21] <michaelgamble> any ideas how to get that?
[19:03:18] <michaelgamble> just occurred to me i can check the class state
[19:05:01] <quuxman> So I've got a problem with a click / touchstart event on an element who's text is replaced every second. The event never fires
[19:05:20] <quuxman> if I remove the code for the text being replaced (which is done with $(foo).text(bar)), it works fine
[19:16:01] <NSA_Working> Thats how we roll | NSA_Working
[19:16:03] <NSA_Working> l
[19:16:48] <quuxman> oh, actually I'm doing it 10x / second. Still, why would updating the text of an element affect a touchstart event? I can see why changing the text between mousedown and mouseup would disrupt a click event, but I don't think it should. I consider that a bug
[19:22:29] <tw2113> shoky, i think it may have been a path issue
[19:23:20] <tw2113> at least for part of it
[19:25:57] <quuxman> usually this channel is a lot more lively
[19:26:01] <quuxman> guess it is a Sunday

[19:52:27] <unnu> sup guys
[19:52:54] <unnu> is there an event for when a file input gets done uploading? or maybe even selected?
[19:57:46] <fat> please help. i have 2 simple popover buttons (exact same code). my 2nd one doesn't work however, except when i change "id = example" to something else and also add it to the javascript. is there anyway, i can make them both workw ithout changing the ID? my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/cFMZL/9/\
[19:57:50] <fat> http://jsfiddle.net/cFMZL/9/
[20:03:46] <shoky> fat: ID's need to be unique - otherwise you are doing it wrong.  if you wanna do it WRONG you can do  $('[id=example]')   which would scan ALL elements in the document
[20:04:43] <fat> shoky: yeah dw, i will do it the correct way
[20:04:51] <shoky> fat: to do it right, change the ID to a class and use $('.example')
[20:05:03] <fat> shoky: i have a foreach statement in php, and it will echo that code over and over again
[20:05:13] <shoky> fat:  then it should echo it as a class, not an ID
[20:05:30] <shoky> e.g.  class="btn example"
[20:09:46] <fat> shoky: please have a look at this example i made : http://codepad.org/BlCrAgUk
[20:11:05] <fat> shoky: it will echo the code 5 times, only the first one will work
[20:12:06] <fat> shoky: i don't know what to do, except if i use the bad way
[20:22:10] <shoky> fat: i told you... class="btn example"
[20:22:15] <mezo> hello guys, running a local copy of my website correctly displays jquery's calendar widget. Running it from the host doesn't show the calendar widget....Anyone had such an issue before?
[20:22:18] <shoky> fat: and then $('.example')
[20:22:30] <fat> shoky: ohh ok thx
[20:22:39] <silv3r_m00n> anything wrong with this, $(function() {  alert('hi'); });       i put it in a script tag at the bottom on  a page and it does not fire
[20:23:28] <shoky> silv3r_m00n: and if you just put the alert without the $(function() {   });   ?
[20:23:43] <silv3r_m00n> let me check
[20:24:23] <shoky> silv3r_m00n: if you put the script at the end of the <body> tag then you don't need it
[20:24:36] <shoky> and in fact you shouldn't use it there, iirc
[20:24:51] <silv3r_m00n> is javascript execution stopped if an error occurs ?
[20:25:09] <shoky> silv3r_m00n: of the current script, yes. getting an error?
[20:25:48] <silv3r_m00n> yeah, there was an error which i didnt notice, i removed that code and now its working fine
[20:26:12] <silv3r_m00n> but there were facebook like box, google analytics code after the error code, how were they working
[20:26:25] <fat> shoky: thank u
[20:26:34] <shoky> silv3r_m00n: different scripts
[20:26:50] <silv3r_m00n> means a different script can load and run ?
[20:26:57] <silv3r_m00n> even after an error
[20:27:06] <shoky> yes. only the currently executing script is stopped
[20:27:31] <silv3r_m00n> great, didnt know that
[20:29:11] <Talon_> im working on a widget using the widget factory api stuff, and I'm working with a UL that the LI's are sortable, everythings working great, but is there some kind of callback or event thats triggered when a sortable items position is changed?
[20:30:22] <shoky> Talon_: yes. have you checked the API docs
[20:30:25] <Talon_> oh, I guess I didn't scroll far enough, looks like change( event, ui )
[21:26:22] <joobie> guys i am using a .click event to do something.. how can i make the dblclick not do anything?
[21:26:43] <joobie> i want to basically make this animate only run once if double clicked or single clicked
[21:26:51] <joobie> right now if you double click it runst he animate twice

[21:37:30] <relipse> I've got an interesting problem
[21:37:59] <astropirate> i doubt it
[21:38:45] <relipse> I'm creating a button, adding an event handler to it, and then when the user closes the dialog the button gets destroyed, do I need to worry about the event handler when i create a new button with the same class and add another event handler to it?
[21:39:25] <relipse> i'm guessing when the button dissappears the event handler also does too?
[21:39:49] <ko2in> relipse: unbind that event when you destory the element
[21:40:24] <relipse> thats what i was worried about
[21:40:28] <shoky> relipse: if you .remove() the button, the event handler is removed for you too.. even if it weren't, a new button wouldn't trigger another button's event handler.  all this assuming you're not using event delegation
[21:40:44] <shoky> relipse: you got nothing to worry about prolly
[21:40:53] <relipse> so i dont even need to 'unbind' it?
[21:40:55] <shoky> no
[21:41:08] <shoky> not if you .remove() it
[21:41:10] <relipse> ok it won't crash the browser eventually or anything will it?
[21:41:15] <relipse> what if i dont .remove() it
[21:41:22] <relipse> it just gets removed from the dom
[21:41:25] <relipse> replaced by other things
[21:41:29] <shoky> how?
[21:41:45] <relipse> dialog('option','title',newtext)
[21:41:49] <relipse> replaces the old
[21:42:18] <shoky> the button was in the title?
[21:42:24] <relipse> it was
[21:42:28] <relipse> correct
[21:43:31] <shoky> you prolly dont need to do anything.. tho without seeing the code its hard to tell for sure
[21:44:00] <relipse> i'm guessint it will be ok
[21:44:49] <shoky> me too

[22:08:26] <Cork> compact: you're using an editor that tries to style the text
[22:08:47] <Cork> use a plane text editor instead it uses  instead of ' for single quotes

[22:09:30] <Cork> (also check your error console)

[23:17:36] <communist-cookie> http://pastie.org/8028926 I try to add delay on my tooltip (which is like tooltip, but does not use tooltip()), but setTimeout does not work here, what do I do wrong? http://pastie.org/8028926
[23:18:31] <Cork> communist-cookie: var self = this; setTimeout... $(self)
[23:18:50] <Cork> this is changed each a function is called
[23:19:50] <communist-cookie> uhm..
[23:20:14] <communist-cookie> like setTimeout(1000, $(self)) ?
[23:20:25] <Cork> function() { $(self) ya
[23:20:43] <Cork> and no the time is the last argument not the first
[23:21:08] <communist-cookie> ah yeah, sorry, I am very tired
[23:21:29] <communist-cookie> could you please tell me in which line should i put it in?
[23:21:41] <communist-cookie> like 15?
[23:21:53] <communist-cookie> For it delays appending?
[23:22:06] <Cork> communist-cookie: tips for the future, use something that is easier to edit for the one you ask for help
[23:22:10] <Cork> like jsfiddle or jsbin
[23:22:41] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/TAjn5/
[23:24:36] <communist-cookie> Cork: thank you :) btw jsfiddle is broken for Opera, and you cannot copy text :)
[23:24:57] <Cork> communist-cookie: ya, same in several other browsers
[23:25:17] <Cork> but you can get it working when it breaks
[23:25:33] <communist-cookie> thank you a lot :)

[23:27:29] <Cork> right now i'm trying to find out what several platforms expect as a base date time format (ruby, python, javascript, go...)
[23:27:44] <Cork> for some annoying reason it's not documented for most of them >_<

[23:28:15] <communist-cookie> and i am here coding some shit
[23:28:26] <Cork> it's just typing a little service and testing what it accepts
[23:28:43] <communist-cookie> document it then ;)
[23:28:51] <Cork> heh
[23:30:07] <communist-cookie> Cork: in the fiddle you sent me .appending process takes place twice
[23:30:12] <communist-cookie> is it neccesary?
[23:30:16] <Cork> no
[23:30:27] <communist-cookie> ok, thanks :)
[23:30:29] <Cork> i just uncommented the setTimeout line you had

[23:30:39] <Cork> same
