[00:01:32] <coldhead> this is the worst aids of my life
[00:02:14] <coldhead> the thing is, Malvagio87 this works fine http://jsfiddle.net/KJ6sT/1/
[00:02:23] <coldhead> and the same code on your page throws a syntax error
[00:02:31] <coldhead> and i can only conclude that there is no god
[00:03:23] <Malvagio87> lol
[00:03:30] <coldhead> if i paste that code into the console it works
[00:03:34] <Malvagio87> want to slee pon it and get back to me tomorrow
[00:04:46] <coldhead> i'm probably the stupidest person in this channel, Malvagio87
[00:04:56] <coldhead> take out the // you added
[00:05:06] <coldhead> and keep pasting that link into the channekl
[00:05:17] <coldhead> and some genius will instantly see the way in which you or i are retarded
[00:05:28] <coldhead> and if you get it fixed please let me know so
[00:05:34] <coldhead> i wish you godspeed
[00:05:54] <coldhead> now i am going to destroy the world
[00:32:37] <alchimista> why? TypeError: $("#myTab a:first") is null
[00:32:58] <alchimista> 	
[00:32:58] <alchimista> $('#myTab a:first').tab('show');
[00:34:13] <ravenzz> $('#myTab a').first()
[00:34:35] <ravenzz> but I am pretty sure that it is not what is causing the probl
[00:36:37] <alchimista> infact now it doesnt give me error, but dont show me
[00:37:04] <alchimista> let me explain, what is my problem, i am using twitter bootsrap tab in php
[00:37:23] <ravenzz> try with console.debug($('#myTab a').first())
[00:37:41] <ravenzz> or even better $('#myTab a').first().data("tabs")
[00:37:53] <alchimista> usually the first tab has the class active, but since i am generating with php i can not initialy give active to <li>
[00:37:59] <ravenzz> anyway for bootstrap related question you should ask #twitter-bootstrap
[00:38:21] <alchimista> thanx, i tought maybe with jquery i can solve it
[00:38:42] <ravenzz> you can with php
[00:38:52] <ravenzz> I guess
[00:39:12] <ravenzz> the first iteration would add the class active to the elem?!
[00:39:25] <alchimista> yeah u r write
[00:39:29] <alchimista> i am stupid
[00:39:32] <alchimista> thanx

[01:33:43] <jeremy-> This is probably probably an annoying question but does anybody have any good links / resources comparing good jquery frameworks for building responsive web sites. I've done a bit of research on google but its hard to qualify whether these reviews/information has it right. I'm interested in which are the most popular ones, which ones have the best features and any potentially upcoming frameworks
[01:33:43] <jeremy-> that are gaining ground

[01:39:20] <aqeel> http://www.slideshare.net/arif_iq/jquery-framework
[01:40:50] <maasha> is there a way to subtract two list of nodes to get unique nodes? $('.foo') - $('.bar')
[01:41:16] <maasha> hm. bad example, but anyway
[01:42:12] <faraway> maasha: $(".foo").not($(".bar"));
[01:42:25] <maasha> faraway: ok
[01:42:49] <faraway> maasha: at least thats how i understood you question ;)
[01:43:28] <maasha> alternatively, is there are way to select only the "deepest" node so that if any parents match they are ignored?
[01:44:00] <aqeel> what are you trying to achieve
[01:44:07] <aqeel> why not simnply select by id or class
[01:44:50] <maasha> aqeel: I am searching a tree and in case of multiple matches in a branch I want the deepest node.
[01:45:58] <faraway> jeremy-: do you mean with responsive website, that the site is alway displayed in an optimal manner, depending on the screen size ?
[01:47:34] <aqeel> why not use loop...search from inside out....if first search found and is inside of second search found, take into account the first search
[01:48:07] <aqeel> use each()
[01:48:14] <jeremy-> thank you
[01:48:20] <jeremy-> for all that information, all very helpful
[01:49:08] <aqeel> u r welcome
[01:50:03] <maasha> faraway: .not works nicely. thanks.
[01:50:58] <aqeel> maasha: got jsfiddle
[01:51:26] <maasha> aqeel: well, its a bit too messy at the moment :)
[01:52:00] <aqeel> maybe we help code along the lines too
[01:53:18] <maasha> much appreciated.
[01:53:22] <aqeel> well room time to go for me.....see you in 2 hours
[01:53:36] <aqeel> office off 6 pm...hong kong time
[01:53:38] <aqeel> bye room
[01:53:58] <maasha> also, I want to do one or two improvements before showing off :)
[01:57:28] <faraway> maasha: always take care with your selectors if you using them often and heavily .. you should try to restrict the search to a certain part of your dom if possible ... eg. elemen.find(".some selector"). not every selector is supported natively by the browser (or every browser) and if it is not supported natively sizzle is used for traversing which can impact performance
[02:00:24] <faraway> maasha: one selector is not always faster then splitting it up into different parts. jquery is really nice for dom traversing, but used the wrong way it could be painful slow
[02:18:25] <jeremy-> Are there any good alternatives to Kendo UI that are entirely free/open source or is it worth investing in that if those features are what i need
[02:19:16] <Cork> jquery-ui jquery-mobile?
[02:20:50] <jeremy-> Yes, i see, and of course there are a lot of data visualisation tools under GPL too
[02:21:06] <Cork> sure
[02:21:21] <Cork> ?.raphael
[02:21:23] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".raphael" in jQuery Docs.
[02:21:26] <Cork> ?g raphael
[02:21:26] <bot-t> Cork, Raphael - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael
[02:21:30] <Cork> -_-
[02:21:33] <Cork> ?g raphael.js
[02:21:33] <jeremy-> Is there much of a learning curve to put them together? I've always found jquery pretty beautiful to work with
[02:21:34] <bot-t> Cork, Raphaël—JavaScript Library - http://raphaeljs.com/
[02:22:15] <Cork> jeremy-: depends on how well versatiled you're with javascript
[02:22:35] <Cork> but sure its not a few hours work
[02:22:54] <jeremy-> I see, well this has been useful information all the same, thanks cork
[02:22:58] <Cork> (depending on what you need that is)
[02:23:07] <jeremy-> I was reading this: http://jqueryuivskendoui.com/
[02:23:18] <Cork> jquery ui and jquery mobile is quite complete
[02:23:36] <Cork> and as long as you're ok with there default look its not much work getting that together
[02:23:54] <Cork> ontop of that you need to put in the work for the data
[02:23:54] <jeremy-> Cool, that was the main thing i was hoping somebody to say
[02:24:31] <jeremy-> Yeh, i suppose i should just scope out the project, and think of it in terms of dollar figure for time and see which way is worth best
[02:24:58] <Cork> looks at what's the easiest to maintain too
[02:25:32] <Cork> i opted to not use mobile cause it's weird choice demanded page flow
[02:26:12] <Cork> on the other hand, i don't really see why a framework is needed for that either way
[02:26:28] <jeremy-> Thats a good point, I'm building a project which is visualising a lot of data, for example google search terms and associated volume of searches, CPC etc across large sets of data, with some cool jquery filters
[02:26:40] <jeremy-> You are probably right in that mobile is just impractical anyway
[02:26:45] <jeremy-> i could potentially look at pads though
[02:27:06] <Cork> no i meant the jquery-mobile framework :)
[02:27:16] <jeremy-> oh i see, gotcha
[02:27:19] <Cork> lol
[02:27:34] <jeremy-> this is internal use not external, otherwise i'm sounding stupid
[02:27:38] <jeremy-> lol
[02:28:10] <Cork> i built the site i working on now almost exclusively with jquery
[02:28:23] <Cork> most of the rest is a few lines of js and css
[02:28:53] <Cork> .ajax does almost everything i see needed to make a jquery-mobile like site work
[02:28:56] <jeremy-> yeh, I was originally planning have a php backend but I'm leaning towards the entire UI being jquery, ive always wante dto do that
[02:29:28] * Cork nods
[02:30:04] <Cork> did that in my last project (same project last iteration (none mobile))
[02:30:11] <Cork> was really fun :)
[02:30:41] <jeremy-> I've noticed that the template market has just gone bananas for responsive jquery stuff in the last 12 months, even 6 months specifically
[02:30:49] <Cork> but the huge list of bugs in mobile browsers makes me scared of doing something like that
[02:30:50] <jeremy-> most notably themeforest and the wordpress market
[02:31:16] <Cork> template market?
[02:31:19] <Cork> you mean cms?
[02:31:29] <Cork> (that's not template)
[02:31:54] <jeremy-> well yeh, themeforest is probably the biggest one of those, if you look at the numbers developers are selling responsive designs in the thousands
[02:32:10] <jeremy-> Well wordpress call them themes, joomla templates
[02:32:38] <Cork> ah you meant the templates/themes for the cms's
[02:32:44] * Cork nods
[02:33:02] <Cork> ya, everyone seams to scramble to get on the mobile train :D
[02:34:36] <Haprog> Does someone know if there's a Chrome extension for better source code syntax highlighting for "view source" that would also highlight javascript syntax in addition to plain html?
[02:35:12] <Cork> Haprog: why don't you just view the js in the script tab in the developer toolbar?
[02:35:40] <jeremy-> You could try firebug but i think the inspector works just as well
[02:35:48] <Cork> or console or what every you call it :)
[02:35:49] <jeremy-> better probably
[02:35:58] <Cork> firebug is for firefox
[02:36:14] <jeremy-> well you can get it for chrome but it does exactly what chrome does
[02:37:35] <Cork> jeremy-: you're talking about firebug lite?
[02:38:08] <Haprog> true.. the Elements source view in developer tools works quite well. sometimes I just hit Ctrl+U for quick fullscreen source view.
[02:38:24] <Haprog> and it opens a new tab
[02:38:35] <Haprog> would be nice if that worked a bit better
[02:39:52] <Haprog> I guess I'm just too used to keeping the developer tools docked in the bottom of the window, but ofcourse I can quickly get it fullscreen also :)
[02:42:23] <jeremy-> I think you basically need to either choose chrome and the inspector and the web developer/firebug for ff, whichever you prefer. It seems a lot of people moved to chrome over the last several years, though.
[02:46:07] <maasha> So my tree search function is behaving wrong and I cant figure out why: http://jsfiddle.net/c6Mqv/. If searching for 'Fusobacteria' I would expect this one branch to unfold, and still see the folded Archaea branch - but that is missing!?!?
[02:51:16] <hokapoka> masch: not sure about the folding, but why aren't you using the psudo :hover selector for your font-weight changes, rather than onmouse(enter|leave)?

[02:55:59] <koopajah> Hey everyone, question about jquery sortable() and the event "over()". Is it normal that it is fired more than once (as long as I stay in the same sortable element) ?
[02:55:59] <boulet101010_> http://jsfiddle.net/BmLmk/1/ is there a simpler way to code this (pls pm if you know how to do it). Tried this http://jsfiddle.net/BmLmk/ first but it's not good because every time you click on a li it creates the event to move it, then when you click on the "add" button the event fires multiple times for each you've clicked on before.
[02:56:15] <manuelbieh> what's the right way to use data from the response of a deferred ajax call in a second ajax call? put the second one in the .done() part of the first?
[02:57:18] <manuelbieh> currently the way i'm going is:
[02:57:33] <manuelbieh> var token = $.ajax({url: tokenURL}); token.done(function(response) { var login = $.ajax({url: loginUrl, data: 'token=' + response.token}); } login.done(function() {....}); });
[02:58:02] <manuelbieh> oh wait. i nopaste it
[02:58:58] <hokapoka> manuelbieh: of cause
[02:59:07] <manuelbieh> http://pastebin.com/gt98Z6BX
[02:59:28] <hokapoka> You have to wait until you've rx'd the response, hence use the callbacks
[02:59:33] <manuelbieh> that's the "right" way, correct?
[02:59:38] * maasha folds
[02:59:52] <manuelbieh> oh
[02:59:54] <manuelbieh> of course
[03:00:13] <hokapoka> Not sure about *right* more like the only way
[03:00:29] <hokapoka> You need to use the Callback to know when the XHR has completed.
[03:00:39] <manuelbieh> yep
[03:01:19] <manuelbieh> i used the success callback as parameter of my ajax config until now
[03:01:33] <manuelbieh> was my first try to use the defered way
[03:05:35] <hokapoka> OIC, yeah that's how I'd do it.
[03:12:12] <ershad> Hi, Is there any way to select objects when a regex pattern matches object's value?

[04:15:46] <maasha> Is there a flavor of .parents() which include siblings?
[04:17:16] <malydok> $('el').parent().children()
[04:18:02] <malydok> .siblings()
[04:18:37] <malydok> wasn't aware of it's existence :p
[04:18:48] <maasha> so to select all parents and siblings?
[04:19:02] <malydok> what do you need selected again?
[04:19:24] <malydok> all siblings of the parent?
[04:19:29] <maasha> for a given element I want all the parents and the parents' siblings
[04:19:42] <malydok> there is only one parent of an element
[04:20:05] <malydok> .parent().siblings()
[04:21:50] <WesleyL> I don't think that also includes the parent itsself, does it?
[04:22:18] <zhulikas> probably not
[04:22:42] <malydok> doesn't indeed
[04:24:24] <malydok> .parent().parent().children() will select the parent as well
[04:25:16] <webdev> hello all.
[04:25:36] <hokapoka> Humm, if it were me, I'd chose another way to select the items you're interested in.
[04:27:00] <hokapoka> While .parent().parent().children() would work, it might be a better option to either add some other means to ident the items or if you're rendering them cache the references in some semanctic structure that allows you to easily reference them
[04:27:53] <geiregjo> Does anyone knows a way to create a listview with 2 columns which is  dynamically populated?
[04:28:09] <zhulikas> .parent().parent() may not exist :D

[06:01:43] <maasha> OK, folding problem fixed.
[06:02:34] <aqeel> maasha still working on
[06:02:47] <maasha> Next issue. I have a search box with the default value 'Search', I would like that to be wiped when selected for typing text. What is the name of the eventhandler?
[06:03:15] <aqeel> the tree searching from inside out is it?
[06:04:07] <maasha> http://jsfiddle.net/c6Mqv/3/
[06:04:22] * maasha wonders if it is just .click()
[06:04:45] <halcyon1234> .blur?  .keyup?
[06:06:49] <halcyon1234> Sorry, I meant .focus, not .blur
[06:08:39] <perty> on focus if value = default value, value = ""
[06:10:10] <aqeel> you can do this by default it has no focus thus search text is tehr and when it receives focus by clicking the text goes away and cursor comes in for text input
[06:11:19] <perty> aqeel you'd have to clear the event handler or it'd lose its text every time it gets focus
[06:11:44] <maasha> gotit. thanks
[06:12:50] <jammanbo> Whats teh correct predicate to use to check whether a jqXHR has finished? The complete callback won't do. This is something external to the $.ajax request which needs to figure out if the jqXHR is still running, in which case it will abort() it.
[06:14:00] <maasha> Did I read somewhere that you should try to limit delegated event listening?
[06:14:40] <maasha> its a bit of a trick question, but opinions are welcome :o)
[06:14:43] <astropirate> I don't know of a reason to do so
[06:14:55] <astropirate> yes yes I do
[06:15:12] <astropirate> but it shoudn't affect performance by much unless you have a few thousand
[06:17:35] <jammanbo> Is the jqXHR.state() == 'pending' if the request is currently running?
[06:18:11] <maasha> a few thousand, ok
[06:22:31] <shoky> jammanbo: yes

[06:23:49] <astropirate> maasha, because, what happens is that it listens for all events on the document level. EVERY event comes to it, and it needs to check that event against all of the delegated events. So the closer to the elements location in the dom you can delegate to, the better
[06:24:07] <jammanbo> shoky: Great. thanks.
[06:25:21] <mazzachre> seutje: Thx (Sorry for long delay, suddenly meeting)
[06:26:31] <maasha> astropirate: right.
[06:28:54] <aqeel> maasha......your code is a mess, you can make use of chaining, biggest advantage of jquery and make use of map where attr, css, and such can have blocked content like...attr({id:'a',class:'b'});.....and make use of prebuild functions, no use in reinventing the wheel...like toggle(), each(), and such
[06:29:21] <maasha> aqeel: hey, I am learning here :o)
[06:29:40] <aqeel> well u need to extend your scope then
[06:29:57] <aqeel> first see if function is available make use of it
[06:30:30] <aqeel> at least ge tthe basics of jquery fucntions as i did...i am also learning
[06:31:12] <aqeel> go through all available basic functions and then from there you can extend your scope
[06:33:26] <maasha> aqeel: right, I was not aware that you could assign several attributes at a time. I'll clean that up. And what else in particular?
[06:33:54] * maasha brings out bucket, water, soap and mop
[06:34:03] <aqeel> haha
[06:38:43] <maasha> aqeel: so {id:'a',class:'b'} is called a map?
[06:39:05] <maasha> this is what you get from learning javascript from w3school :o/
[06:39:45] <geiregjo> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/pages/page-dynamic.html
[06:40:03] <geiregjo> Did anyone of you try this? I got it working but I get some strange behaviour in my navigation.
[06:40:20] <geiregjo> The buttons are not highlighted correctly
[06:42:46] <aqeel> http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[06:42:48] <aqeel> yes
[06:43:04] <aqeel> nope from documents itself
[06:43:21] <aqeel> .attr( map )  mapA map of attribute-value pairs to set.
[06:44:01] <aqeel> that is why i said read the basic functions() first.....one function might do more than one thing...\
[06:44:51] <aqeel> your css can be grouped too....
[06:48:56] <maasha> aqeel: there is only two times css in the javascript code - where it makes sense - and the rest is grouped nicely in the css file, no?
[06:49:56] <aqeel>     background:#EEEEEE;     background-image:url('tree.png');     background-repeat:no-repeat;     background-position:right top;--------------------------> bacgground: properties; (background-indevidual properties can be grouped under background)
[06:53:35] <maasha> aqeel: ah, I remember something about that, now you mention it, but thought it unnecessary for the tiny things I make.
[06:54:05] <aqeel>  background:#EEEEEE url('tree.png') no-repeat right top;
[06:54:27] <aqeel> tiny tiny makes huge
[06:54:39] <aqeel> 1+1 makes 2
[07:02:28] <halcyon1234> jquery mobile: in ie9, if I click on a hyperlink with transition, rather than the address bar showing Page2.html, I end up with Page1.html#Page2.html  (In FF, I can see it does the same thing, but then changes the address bar to Page2.html properly)
[07:03:24] <aqeel> use conditional.......jquery mobile is for mobile , jquery is for desktop
[07:04:28] <aqeel> some mishap is to be known...
[07:05:06] <halcyon1234> As long as its expected, I'm okay. (I'm not coding two different websites, one for mobile, one for jquery. They use effectively completely different classes, layout, syntax, etc).
[07:13:08] <aqeel> maasha:  fast way t learn http://jqapi.ru/
[07:14:36] <maasha> aqeel: I was thinking about getting a proper book.
[07:14:59] <aqeel> that is upto you...but no book is complete book
[07:15:16] <aqeel> i have like four different books but yet not complete
[07:15:43] <maasha> aqeel: you have to start somewhere and a good start is work half completed ...
[07:16:00] <NCS_One> hi
[07:16:13] <aqeel> i rather say print all documents from jquery api site itself...
[07:16:51] <aqeel> but again its your choice to make
[07:18:05] <NCS_One> shouldn't "$('#elementid :radio).length;" be the same has "$('#elementid').filter(':radio).length;" ?
[07:18:33] <NCS_One> I mean do the same
[07:19:28] <maasha> aqeel: good coding practice does not come from the API documentation.
[07:19:30] <Carlitta87> hi..i am using bxslider to create a slide. i placed a caption on each slide. I would like the caption area to slide to the right after each click to NEXT and slide to the left on each click to PREVIOUS. Could anyone assist me with this?
[07:19:49] <maasha> instead you should print #irc
[07:19:56] <maasha> :P
[07:20:00] <aqeel> and if you want something from jquery , get to know javascript...http://www.addedbytes.com/download/javascript-cheat-sheet-v1/pdf/
[07:20:18] <aqeel> http://www.addedbytes.com/cheat-sheets/javascript-cheat-sheet/
[07:21:13] <aqeel> get to know where they belong and what they do, then go on with coding as you will know what they mean and standfor as well as what they do
[07:23:22] <aqeel> for coding practice makes perfect, as your understanding goes on and you get to know better
[07:28:25] <aqeel> maasha: http://oscarotero.com/jquery/
[07:29:22] <aqeel> i guess that is not too much for one time sitting to absorb all that
[07:30:30] <MalMen> what is the page to put and test my code here ?
[07:30:40] <MalMen> !paste
[07:31:27] <NCS_One> MalMen: http://jsfiddle.net  ???
[07:31:28] <aqeel> i have css3 + javascript + jquery + html 5 + transition to html 5 + reserved words for javascript.............cheet sheet which i have mostly absorbed already
[07:31:34] <MalMen> yesss. thank you :)
[07:32:21] <NCS_One> yw
[07:32:57] <MalMen> http://jsfiddle.net/p3pRw/ how can i check every input with name = data_ti[]
[07:33:02] <MalMen> its a an array, right ?
[07:33:12] <MalMen> need to do some sort of for
[07:34:15] <aqeel> jquery has each() specific for the purpose of for
[07:35:07] <MalMen> hmmm
[07:37:47] <BillCriswell> MalMen: You can access them with $(':input[name="data_ti[]"]')
[07:38:42] <aqeel> out of scope question, where to get silver fonts if possible
[07:38:58] <aqeel> for photoshop purposes
[07:39:12] <BillCriswell> color: #C0C0C0;
[07:39:46] <aqeel> silver is not color but name of font type
[07:40:40] <Malvagio87_Lapto> hello everyone
[07:40:49] <aqeel> hi
[07:40:51] <MalMen> $.each($('input[name=data_ti]'), function (teste){ its somethingl ike this ?
[07:41:06] <Malvagio87_Lapto> i am trying to sum up data in rows but i cant seem to get it to work right and i dont know why
[07:41:12] <MalMen> data_ti its various inputs name=data_ti[]
[07:41:13] <Malvagio87_Lapto> im pulling the data using mysql
[07:41:25] <Malvagio87_Lapto> here is my php http://pastie.org/5406587 and the link to the site is
[07:41:30] <Malvagio87_Lapto> http://173.201.188.162/mcmmo/
[07:41:38] <aqeel> sorry this is jquery not mysql room
[07:41:48] <BillCriswell> MalMen: You're in #jquery
[07:41:53] <Malvagio87_Lapto> right and im using jquery
[07:42:07] <Malvagio87_Lapto> oh lol
[07:42:21] <MalMen> Malvagio87_Lapto $.each its not a jquery function ?
[07:43:39] <MalMen> BillCriswell my question is not jquery related?
[07:44:10] <BillCriswell> I abused my tab key MalMen. I meant to type Malvagio87_Lapto.
[07:44:26] <MalMen> ahhh, no problem :)
[07:45:56] <Malvagio87_Lapto> i guess since i was in here last night and asked that question i would try asking it in here again
[07:47:06] <BillCriswell> MalMen: You would do like $('input[name^=data_ti]').each(function(index,el) { // Logic in here! });
[07:47:35] <BillCriswell> MalMen: http://jsbin.com/epimel/1/edit for example.
[07:50:06] <MalMen> BillCriswell i appreciate your help, will give a try :)
[07:51:37] <BillCriswell> MalMen: Good luck, have fun!
[08:00:15] <TheBrayn> is it possible to set the a site as a home page with js?

[08:00:54] <TheBrayn> that's good
[08:05:43] <LindsayMac> Hey guys. I'm working on a little animation where when you hover it expands/reveals and when you mouseout it does the opposite. That is all working fine, but I am strangely loosing some CSS styles when this happens and I'm not sure why.
[08:06:14] <LindsayMac> (working on an example)
[08:06:16] <drTerminal> hey guys. i have a little problem about auto saving forms. i explained it here : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13476816/ajax-how-to-save-automatically-my-django-form
[08:06:39] <drTerminal> i need a plugin or sth like that. i am so newbie about jquery / ajax
[08:07:06] <andrew9184> how do i make the hover box stay visible when it is hovered on
[08:07:06] <andrew9184> http://jsfiddle.net/FmXR8/1/
[08:07:45] <LindsayMac> andrew9184:  HUH?
[08:08:19] <andrew9184> the gray box fades out when i hover over it
[08:09:58] <BillCriswell> andrew9184: Make bar a parent of foo instead of the wway you have it.
[08:10:11] <BillCriswell> a child*
[08:12:59] <BillCriswell> andrew9184: Depending on the browsers you have to support you might be able to get away with this http://jsbin.com/udovuh/1/edit
[08:13:47] <koopajah> LindsayMac > did you try chrome inspector? With it you can force the "hover" state and check where your classes are coming from
[08:14:02] <LindsayMac> koopajah:  yea ...
[08:14:04] <andrew9184> ah, and just let css3 handle the fadein and out ?
[08:14:41] <BillCriswell> andrew9184: You can definitely do that. Use opacity: 0, and opacity: 1 instead of display there.
[08:15:00] <BillCriswell> If you plan on using animations.
[08:15:07] <LindsayMac> koopajah:  working on an example right now, but the style doesn't go away when you hover, so I don't really know why
[08:16:14] <BillCriswell> andrew9184: http://jsbin.com/udovuh/1/edit like so
[08:16:43] <BillCriswell> Probably want some more vendor prefixed properties up in that shit but it's the basic idea.
[08:18:01] <andrew9184> Thanks BillCriswell
[08:18:11] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[08:19:19] <andrew9184> much better than having to use $.hover
[08:19:31] <LindsayMac> koopajah: finished me example: http://jsfiddle.net/VhkZB/
[08:19:54] <LindsayMac> strangely it's not reacting the same was as it is on my demo site. the <span> isn't disappearing on mouseout
[08:20:30] <BillCriswell> andrew9184: Yeah, less supported though at the same time. If you have to support browsers that don't understand transitions you'll have to use the hover way anyway.
[08:20:40] <BillCriswell> It'll be easier to code out with the HTML like that, though.
[08:20:50] <koopajah> LindsayMac > mmm so there's something in your code that leads to losing the span class somewhere
[08:21:14] <LindsayMac> actually the little > at the end of the "ribbon" is not created by the span class..
[08:21:40] <BillCriswell> andrew9184: Well, jquery fallback for browsers that don't support it.
[08:21:51] <LindsayMac> koopajah:  in regards to the <span> content not disappearing on mouseout, I am getting this error: Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: .wpfp-span, , this
[08:21:53] <andrew9184> wonder if it works on the ipad
[08:21:54] <BillCriswell> Sucks having to repeat yourself, but it's all up to the project.
[08:22:20] <koopajah> LindsayMac > on which line of code exactly? aren't you missing quote aroung your selector ?
[08:23:57] <BillCriswell> andrew9184: Definitely not.
[08:24:19] <Malvagio87> can jquery sum up values in a row?
[08:24:42] <BillCriswell> You can test for touch events and if touch events exist you could just display that div anyway.
[08:24:47] <LindsayMac> koopajah:  ahh I see the missing quote. happened when I moved it over I guess
[08:24:55] <BillCriswell> .touch .outer div { display: block; }
[08:24:59] <BillCriswell> Well.. opacity.
[08:25:14] <BillCriswell> Malvagio87: Absolutely.
[08:25:15] <koopajah> LindsayMac > the aspect of > at the end of the ribbon come from your css in .favRibbon:after
[08:25:24] <LindsayMac> koopajah:  yes
[08:25:36] <Malvagio87> billcriswell can you pint me in the directiopn of figuring out how to
[08:26:35] <LindsayMac> koopajah:  oh weird. It actually was in my code on my test site.. and fixing the missing quote has given me SyntaxError: Unexpected token this
[08:26:52] <LindsayMac> oops nevermind
[08:26:53] <koopajah> what's your exact line ?
[08:26:53] <BillCriswell> Malvagio87: It would be along the lines of going through all the tds in a specific tr, then parseInt( textOfTd, 10 ) and just adding those as you go along.
[08:27:12] <koopajah> yeah seems like the same error on your jsfiddle with two commas instead of one and a ' at the end after this
[08:27:36] <Malvagio87> is there a tutorial on it ... ive kiond of just taught myself php and javascript in a day so im not toofamiliar with the jargon yet lol
[08:27:41] <Malvagio87> http://173.201.188.162/mcmmo/ is the site
[08:28:11] <LindsayMac> koopajah:  yea I see that now..
[08:28:31] <anli__> Is it possible to have a watcher that checks if a certain attribute changes?
[08:28:45] <Malvagio87> so i want all the values for player X to be summed up and input under the sum symbol
[08:28:47] <LindsayMac> koopajah:  ok.. So now I have fixed the typos caused by moving it over.. I still loose the favRibbon:after http://jsfiddle.net/VhkZB/1/
[08:29:30] <BillCriswell> Malvagio87: I don't know where you want the totals.
[08:30:00] <Malvagio87> look at that site again
[08:30:14] <Malvagio87> i want the totals under the sigma where i made them have no values now
[08:30:39] <james4765> doing an update to a jqm app, and having problems with device rotation on Android. Header and footer resize, but the body content does not
[08:31:09] <james4765> latest everything (jqm, jquery, phonegap)
[08:31:15] <koopajah> LindsayMac > seems like you lose them only if you "hover" then "out" then "hover" again before the "out" is finished
[08:32:14] <LindsayMac> koopajah:  Ahh yes. That is true...
[08:32:36] <LindsayMac> koopajah:  i am running a .stop() before the animate and I thought that would help moving from one to another quickly causing issues.
[08:33:17] <LindsayMac> koopajah:  I would like to avoid the loss of the > during the animation
[08:35:45] <koopajah> LindsayMac > I'm not sure you can combine :after property and jquery's animate
[08:36:22] <james4765> I mean, I can trigger a page regeneration easily enough, but would rather not have to write that
[08:36:29] <LindsayMac> koopajah:  that is strange because it seems as though adding a percentage width to the ribbon with the :after would just let it move as the width expands
[08:37:12] <koopajah> LindsayMac > hmm sorry that's too specific for me, maybe someone else can take a look if you ask again your question
[08:37:31] <james4765> if there's a function I can call to trigger the resize logic without a page refresh or a $().trigger('pagecreate') that would be awesome
[08:37:35] <LindsayMac> koopajah:  thanks for helping me fix up my typos in the meantime!
[08:39:26] <BillCriswell> Malvagio87: That was a fun exercise lol
[08:39:31] <Malvagio87> ?
[08:39:39] <BillCriswell> I just coded it up.
[08:39:46] <james4765> I had tried doing this a year ago, couldn't figure it out, and locked the app in portrait mode because of it
[08:40:05] <Malvagio87> really ... thank you
[08:40:34] <BillCriswell> Malvagio87: http://pastie.org/pastes/5406843/text
[08:41:06] <BillCriswell> I wish I felt like doing my work.
[08:41:16] <BillCriswell> I need a different job.
[08:41:53] <Malvagio87> BillCriswell, it didnt work =(
[08:42:31] <BillCriswell> You didn't wrap it in a document ready.
[08:42:44] <BillCriswell> Yo ucould also just put it in the footer right before </body>
[08:43:24] <Malvagio87> so where should i put it
[08:44:06] <BillCriswell> I keep my scripts right before </body>.
[08:44:30] <LindsayMac> Hey guys. I am having some issues with a css style that has an :after applied to it. Basically I am loosing the :after style during animation http://jsfiddle.net/VhkZB/1/
[08:45:05] <Malvagio87> so
[08:45:19] <Malvagio87> like this http://pastie.org/5406874
[08:46:04] <lduros> hi there, I am placing some javascript in a templated page, and jquery is loaded at the bottom of the page, my question is, can I use window.onload or something else to make sure my javascript code (which appears before the jquery.js in the page) will not create an error and will load properly?
[08:46:17] <BillCriswell> Malvagio87: You should be able to figure out a syntax error. ;)
[08:46:28] <Malvagio87> BillCriswell, i wish i could .. still elarning lol
[08:46:36] <LindsayMac> iaj:  why not load it properly?
[08:46:40] <LindsayMac> oops
[08:46:44] <iaj> I dunno dude :D
[08:46:46] <LindsayMac> lduros:  ^^
[08:46:55] <LindsayMac> iaj:  sorry! Thought his name was an i and not L
[08:47:02] <lduros> LindsayMac: why not load what properly? my javascript, or the jquery?
[08:47:06] <theForce> hi
[08:47:13] <BillCriswell> Malvagio87: Are you using Chrome?
[08:47:16] <Malvagio87> yes
[08:47:19] <theForce> how can i select the n'th td in a given table tr?
[08:47:28] <LindsayMac> lduros:  why not load them in the proper order , library first and initialize script second
[08:47:37] <BillCriswell> Right click, inspect element, look at the console.
[08:47:37] <Malvagio87>  im in f12
[08:47:55] <tw2113> that'd be the same thing
[08:47:57] <BillCriswell> That'll work too.
[08:48:08] <BillCriswell> Haha yeah. I just wasn't sure what OS.
[08:48:12] <lduros> LindsayMac: hmm, yes, but I'd have to inject my code after that in the template, which is somewhat annoying because it forces me to add it to the main template file... I was just hoping there was a workaround
[08:48:18] <lduros> i guess I'll add it to the bottom then...
[08:48:24] <BillCriswell> I'm on a Mac so it's not the same thing.
[08:48:35] <LindsayMac> idoru:  what are you using as a templating system?
[08:48:40] <LindsayMac> ahh!
[08:48:41] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/get/ @ theForce
[08:48:43] <LindsayMac> stupid name!
[08:48:50] <LindsayMac> lduros:  what are you using as a templating system ..
[08:48:55] <Malvagio87> BillCriswell, i see the console but i dont know how to fix the error
[08:49:04] <LindsayMac> let's make a rule.. don't use lowercase L to beging a screenname ;_
[08:49:05] <lduros> LindsayMac: it's something custom, long story
[08:49:05] <lduros> :-)
[08:49:15] <LindsayMac> lduros:  got it
[08:49:22] <BillCriswell> Malvagio87: Put ); at the end of line 14 (in the pastie )
[08:49:38] <lduros> LindsayMac: let's make a rule: please use a font that will show a difference between l and 1 :-P
[08:49:43] <BillCriswell> Malvagio87: It's an unexpected } because the first .each() wasn't properly closed.
[08:50:07] <LindsayMac> lduros:  well played, lduros.. well played
[08:50:26] <Malvagio87> sill didnt work
[08:50:57] <BillCriswell> Malvagio87: I tried it and it worked.
[08:51:02] <LindsayMac> anyone mind taking a look and letting me know why I am loosing my :after class on animate of width http://jsfiddle.net/VhkZB/1/
[08:51:20] <BillCriswell> Malvagio87: There's still an error.
[08:51:27] <Malvagio87> BillCriswell, i just uploaded it to the site and im still getting an error
[08:52:17] <BillCriswell> Malvagio87: Dude.
[08:52:29] <LindsayMac> BillCriswell:  are you familiar with Help Vampires?
[08:52:52] <BillCriswell> LindsayMac: They always get me haha.
[08:53:30] <Malvagio87> lol sorry
[08:53:33] <Malvagio87> figured it out
[08:53:36] <Malvagio87> thank you
[08:53:40] <BillCriswell> It's all good! No problem.
[08:53:51] <Malvagio87> ive got another question for you
[08:54:04] <BillCriswell> Did you try it on your own yet?
[08:54:11] <Malvagio87> im not sure how to
[08:54:20] <Malvagio87> if oyu point me where i can read up on this i will do that
[08:54:24] <BillCriswell> Ok deal.
[08:54:28] <BillCriswell> Hopefully I can help
[08:54:38] <Malvagio87> i want to add another column called Rank
[08:54:44] <Malvagio87> which i can do
[08:55:04] <Malvagio87> but i dont know how to rank the players
[08:55:15] <Malvagio87> whoever has the highest sum would have the higest rank
[08:56:36] <BillCriswell> Malvagio87: The more I hear about what you're trying to do the more I think you should be using SQL.
[08:56:45] <BillCriswell> using an SQL query*
[08:56:49] <Malvagio87> im using sql to pull the values
[08:57:04] <LindsayMac> Malvagio87:  you can use it to run some math on them too
[08:57:45] <james4765> any jqm folks about? Could use a little expert advice about resize on device rotation
[08:58:04] <LindsayMac> james4765:  i only used it a little bit. Maybe I can help?
[08:58:20] <LindsayMac> and I gave up on it after a while and did my mobile app more adhoc
[08:58:28] <james4765> latest jqm, trying to get rotation to work right on android
[08:58:35] <james4765> header and footer resize
[08:58:39] <james4765> listview does not
[08:59:09] <james4765> nor does the background image
[08:59:25] <LindsayMac> james4765:  do you have an example?
[08:59:32] <[Jasper]> hej guys, is it possible with jquery to dynamically add javascript code and to REMOVE javascript code ?
[08:59:36] <james4765> it's in a phonegap project
[08:59:55] <LindsayMac> hmm...
[09:00:09] <BillCriswell> Malvagio87: sum() and order by will get you where you need to be then you won't need to run that code I gave you.
[09:00:14] <BillCriswell> Lunch time.
[09:00:14] <james4765> and our currently released version is locked to portrait mode becasue of problems like this
[09:00:15] <NoiseEee> [Jasper]: removing it is pointless, yes you can add
[09:00:36] <LindsayMac> james4765: maybe a screen shot of whats happened?
[09:00:36] <james4765> boss got a tablet, so now we need to fix it :P
[09:01:00] <james4765> give me a moment, and I'll have it
[09:01:44] <[Jasper]> what makes you say removing it is pointless?
[09:02:52] <LindsayMac> james4765:  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0">
[09:03:39] <james4765> already there for the iOS scaling issues
[09:04:31] <LindsayMac> james4765:  ok..
[09:04:51] <kontoo> uhm i have a more general question, hope someone can help. if i push out alot of changes to my site (say to css, js files), how can i make sure the clients always use the current version. is there anything i can do to invalidate the browser cache after a code change?
[09:06:15] <LindsayMac> kontoo:  are you using google api access?
[09:06:34] <kontoo> LindsayMac: nope, never heard of hat
[09:06:36] <kontoo> that*
[09:06:48] <LindsayMac> kontoo:  well you can use google's version of jquery (or other libraries)
[09:06:54] <MalMen> $('input[name^=hora_ti]:3').val() its possible something like this ?
[09:07:04] <LindsayMac> http://mhuntdesign.com/blog/jquery/linking-to-googles-jquery-repository/
[09:07:11] <kontoo> LindsayMac: you mean a CDN?
[09:07:22] <LindsayMac> kontoo:  yea. sorry. brain is fuzzy because i'm a little sick today
[09:08:27] <kontoo> LindsayMac: np, but I'm looking for a solution so that when i push a change to my css file that the client gets this too... i saw something with generated ids in file names but not sure how exactly
[09:08:36] <LindsayMac> Ohhhh i see..
[09:08:55] <LindsayMac> kontoo:  wordpress actually has the function for that built  in with enqueue scripts
[09:09:05] <kontoo> hmm interesting
[09:09:07] <LindsayMac> but if youre not using wordpress, maybe you can have a look to see how they did it
[09:09:18] <LindsayMac> kontoo: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script
[09:09:18] <kontoo> that's a starting point, thanks (:
[09:09:32] <LindsayMac> kontoo:  it adds a version in to the file name/path
[09:10:06] <kontoo> LindsayMac: gonna look at it!
[09:11:08] <james4765> LindsayMac: portrait - http://samples.broadtime.com/share/landscape.png
[09:11:25] <james4765> err, that was landscape
[09:11:45] <james4765> portrait: http://samples.broadtime.com/share/portrait.png
[09:14:39] <velcrobots> have this just about working.  when i click on a sub-menu link, though, i want to remove any other "active" classes on the OTHER sub-menus, and also collapse them.  http://jsfiddle.net/velcrobots/FsexR/8/
[09:15:00] <velcrobots> nly familiar with "siblings" in jquery
[09:15:02] <velcrobots> *only
[09:15:17] <james4765> screenshots are SOO much easier on the mac
[09:17:12] <LindsayMac> james4765:  one minute. Someone just popped in to the studio
[09:19:59] <MalMen> var accoes = $("#accoes_1").clone(); can i change the id name on cloning ?
[09:20:33] <MalMen> i think on substr but not work :\
[09:20:50] <ajpiano> accoes.attr("id", "accoes_2")
[09:21:26] <army> hm
[09:21:30] <army> RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[09:22:15] <MalMen> ajpiano thank you :)
[09:25:20] <JSM87> Hi guys, any idea why this isnt working? Im trying to remove that span. http://pastebin.com/6r6bmC6t
[09:25:21] <Malvagio87> ok so i have got it so when the website loads it sorts the list with the values of the sum going from top to bottom!
[09:25:39] <Malvagio87> however is there a way to corresppond the sum with a rank
[09:26:39] <army> is there an easy way to reload/rehash all js librarys after an ajax call?
[09:28:42] <Teduardo> is there a way to make the largest element in a jquery ui accordian not be the size of all windows, i mean can it have a scroll bar in that window if it's larger than a set height?
[09:29:05] <tomfuertes> Sup guys!  More best practice than jQuery related Q; I'm trying to append tracking to a third party function.  Am I missing any best practices on line 8 & 12: http://jsfiddle.net/TomFuertes/62n9f/ && https://gist.github.com/da048b5e976b1a64056d
[09:29:46] <LindsayMac> james4765:  ok i'm back
[09:29:48] <LindsayMac> sorry
[09:29:51] <james4765> no problem
[09:30:13] <LindsayMac> james4765:  So where am I looking to see your issue
[09:30:25] <LindsayMac> because right now it looks pretty ok
[09:30:42] <james4765> the listview arrows on the right side are cut off
[09:30:52] <LindsayMac> ahhhh i see
[09:30:56] <james4765> it's more of an issue on other pages, that have the split listview
[09:31:03] <james4765> you then can't navigate to them at all
[09:31:19] <LindsayMac> james4765:  I understand. So like you said.. it's not shrinking when the screen shrinks
[09:31:19] <james4765> happens with forms and text pages too
[09:31:24] <james4765> right
[09:31:31] <james4765> but, the header and footer does
[09:31:36] <LindsayMac> james4765:  sorry that I needed a screenshot to have that exlained to me. I"m more of a visual person
[09:31:49] <LindsayMac> james4765:  so, what does your code look like? Could there be something in the styles overriding it?
[09:32:01] <james4765> there's very little in the app css
[09:32:12] <james4765> let me look, though
[09:32:14] <tomfuertes> JSM87: onlick !== onclick
[09:32:25] <LindsayMac> james4765:  if you wanna paste it somewhere I can take a look too.
[09:33:06] <JSM87> tomfuertes: Silly me! Good spot thanks
[09:33:10] <Zitter> hi all, are there HTML APIs calls using JQuery? I mean: how do you manage HTML5 APIs, using JQ?
[09:33:25] <Malvagio87> where can iadd an if statement to this where if the value =0 output "-" http://pastie.org/5407100
[09:33:44] <james4765> yeah, the only widths coded in the app css are for the homepage, to fix some old iOS formatting issues
[09:33:55] <ajpiano> Zitter: you just use the HTML5 apis of the elements
[09:33:57] <james4765> the data pages are jqm only
[09:34:11] <ajpiano> you can use jQuery to to access the elements, and if you want, to write sugar over apis if you want
[09:34:18] <ajpiano> but there's nothing special built into jquery for it
[09:34:19] <james4765> except for the background image, which is a single class applied to the page
[09:34:50] <Malvagio87> anyone know lol
[09:34:57] <LindsayMac> james4765:  if you launch it on portrait mode does it not expand to landscape? or is it always stuck in landscape now matter how it was laucned
[09:34:57] <Zitter> ajpiano, thanks
[09:35:15] <tomfuertes> Malvagio87: $tr.find('td:eq(2)').text( total ? total : "-" ) // might work
[09:37:14] <james4765> launching it in portrait...
[09:37:31] <Malvagio87> tomfuertes, that worked
[09:37:34] <Malvagio87> thank you
[09:37:47] <tomfuertes> np
[09:38:21] <Malvagio87> tomfuertes, for some reason 2 people have no values ... do you know what would cause that?
[09:38:29] <Malvagio87> http://173.201.188.162/mcmmo/
[09:39:17] <james4765> hm, it's resizing in portrait mode too
[09:39:35] <james4765> let me comment out the background image, see what happens
[09:39:58] <LindsayMac> james4765:  i may have found something usefull for you http://www.wintellect.com/cs/blogs/rrobinson/archive/2011/07/25/how-to-scale-a-jquery-mobile-site-for-ios.aspx
[09:40:27] <Malvagio87> tomfuertes, does that make any sense to you?
[09:40:50] <LindsayMac> I know it's not exactly your problem, but without seeing your code, its really literally shooting int he dark
[09:41:25] <LindsayMac> So I have a question. Anyone know why I am loosing the :after css styling during animation and/or if I stop the animation in the middle of it via mouseout ? http://jsfiddle.net/VhkZB/1/
[09:41:32] <LindsayMac> (hover over the pick tabs)
[09:42:00] <tomfuertes> Malvagio87:  looking at it
[09:42:03] <Malvagio87> k
[09:42:31] <james4765> I had something similar in there, will see what happens with taht minor change
[09:42:58] <LindsayMac> james4765:  it seems that minor change could make a big difference
[09:43:08] <tomfuertes> Malvagio87: Try playing with the number here: #myTable tr:gt(2)
[09:43:29] <tomfuertes> Malvagio87: #myTable tr:gt(2) || #myTable tr:gt(1) || #myTable tr
[09:43:32] <Malvagio87> and doing what with it?
[09:43:34] <Malvagio87> ah
[09:43:42] <LindsayMac> james4765:  I should also note that background:cover does not work on iphones, so if you have the background set to stretch, its not going to work
[09:43:49] <lduros> $.ajax({dataType: "html"}); doesn't actually load the js in that html response?
[09:43:52] <james4765> feh
[09:43:53] <JSM87> tomfuertes: Still is not removing the span, any ideas? http://pastebin.com/SWunvcmd
[09:43:58] <james4765> that's exactly what I was using
[09:44:04] <LindsayMac> james4765:  damn.
[09:44:13] <james4765> looks like it may be an issue with later android as well
[09:44:14] <tomfuertes> JSM87: working for me: http://jsfiddle.net/TomFuertes/MhzDd/
[09:44:15] <LindsayMac> oh wait.. you were using background-stretch: cover ... or the meta i posted
[09:44:18] <LindsayMac> ?
[09:44:26] <james4765> background-stretch
[09:44:38] <LindsayMac> james4765:  ahh ok. Yea, it doesnt work on i-devices. I had the same issue
[09:44:42] <Malvagio87> tomfuertes, $('#myTable tr:gt(0)').each(function(){ worked
[09:44:56] <james4765> told my boss this super-stylized thing won't work with html5 mobile apps
[09:44:58] <LindsayMac> I did a website that has a large background image and I wanted to make it responsive but because of that instead I just made a second theme.
[09:45:06] <james4765> they're not stable browsers yet
[09:45:07] <JSM87> tomfuertes: Would it matter if that in the paste bin is being created dynamically?
[09:45:29] <james4765> time to comment out some things
[09:45:32] <LindsayMac> james4765:  well, you can set a different background with a media query and make it the right size for an iphone.. then the viewport meta SHOULD stretch it
[09:45:44] <tomfuertes> JSM87: shouldn't
[09:47:21] <tomfuertes> AJPiano: as I live and breathe!
[09:47:32] <ajpiano> wat
[09:47:32] <b-ot> I AM EDUARD FERENC. I NEED SOMETHING FOR UPLOADING MUSIC VIDEOS--MINE ! IS THAT "V8" FOR THAT? I WONT VIDEO SERVER,FOR HIGHEST SPEED THAN OTHER?FOR UPLOADING,AND RECORDING MY VIDEOS?
[09:47:37] <LindsayMac> Anyone have a help with my little issue?
[09:47:47] <james4765> all right, switching from cover to auto on background-stretch
[09:47:48] <LindsayMac> b-ot: caps.. please.
[09:47:49] <tomfuertes> ajpiano: you know paul irish?
[09:47:58] <ajpiano> yes
[09:48:01] <tomfuertes> ajpiano: <-- thisbetom
[09:48:10] <ajpiano> ohhhhh
[09:48:17] <ajpiano> hey man!
[09:48:20] <tomfuertes> sup!
[09:48:35] <ajpiano> you know how i do
[09:48:40] <Solander> Hi there
[09:48:50] <tomfuertes> zomg I've seen you guys on yayquery
[09:48:56] <tomfuertes> It's like a thing
[09:49:11] <ajpiano> it is
[09:49:37] <Solander> IÂ´d like to use a fullscreen gallery (galleria) on my page (http://www.anotherstyle.de/wordpress/galerie/) problem: true fullscreen works only on the second time I click on the image, any ideas?
[09:49:45] <tomfuertes> Can you help me w/ my best practice Q?  Worried I might be missing something on line 8 & 12: http://jsfiddle.net/TomFuertes/62n9f/ && https://gist.github.com/da048b5e976b1a64056d
[09:50:17] <LindsayMac> Ugh i HATE that...
[09:50:24] <LindsayMac> i HATE things that take over my screen..
[09:50:51] <Solander> to presentate images I like it
[09:51:01] <LindsayMac> Solander: presentate?
[09:51:10] <BillCriswell> As long as it's in the browser window I don't mind it.
[09:51:16] <LindsayMac> Solander:  honestly, from a UI standpoint, you are better off making it full browser window.
[09:51:19] <Solander> present :)
[09:51:24] <LindsayMac> BillCriswell:  took the words out of my mouth!
[09:51:36] <LindsayMac> Solander:  look into something that takes a full window, not takes over my entire screen.
[09:51:45] <LindsayMac> HATRED will ensue ;)
[09:51:54] <james4765> hm, not working. Wondering if the homepage is scaling the viewport too wide...
[09:51:59] <ajpiano> tomfuertes: i mean, typically i wouldn't bother storing the old function on the object
[09:52:00] <james4765> Gonna try fixing that
[09:52:13] <ajpiano> i would just have a private local var
[09:52:14] <LindsayMac> james4765:  do you have every page on one "real page" so you swipe left/right?
[09:52:20] <james4765> no
[09:52:23] <ajpiano> and yeah, i'd probably call it with .call( this, e);
[09:52:24] <james4765> it's all dynamic
[09:52:54] <LindsayMac> james4765:  but it's loading in one page though right? You aren't going to a different url / ACTUAL page when you go to the next pages? Or are you?
[09:53:00] <james4765> $(page).html(result-from-template).trigger('pagecreate')
[09:53:16] <Solander> @LindsayMac: well, on normal mode its just full window, but at least I'd like to have the option to get it right (or the way IÂ´d like it to be :))
[09:53:20] <james4765> all json into mustache tempaltes
[09:53:48] <tomfuertes> ajpiano: thanks!
[09:54:09] <ajpiano> welxx
[09:54:21] <LindsayMac> Solander:  the fact that when people click to enlarge, you want it to pop up a full screen window that takes over, that isn't exactly giving an option. If you REALLY want, just make a button that says "launch as full screen slideshow" separate from clicking to expand an image
[09:55:02] <Solander> jea, that might be an option to
[09:55:08] <LindsayMac> james4765: so could it be that one of the pages has a single element that has some kind of fixed pixel width that is causing a left/right overflow and effecting all subsequent pages ?
[09:55:15] <LindsayMac> Solander:  its your best option IMHO
[09:55:36] <james4765> I'm thinking that - the landing page is hardcoded tables
[09:55:37] <LindsayMac> I have done quite a few photographer's sites.. and looked at them as well. I know what pisses people off and what people want to actually see.
[09:55:52] <LindsayMac> james4765:  can you just remove the landing page for now to test without it?
[09:56:11] <james4765> no, it's got all the links to the data on it
[09:56:23] <james4765> "elegant" navigation
[09:56:34] <Solander> well, you might have a point there, so Ill be working on that extra button, thanks a lot!
[09:56:40] <LindsayMac> james4765:  can you run a direct query to get to the data /load the data via a url just for testing?
[09:56:47] <LindsayMac> Solander:  no problem. Good luck
[09:56:50] <jeffsmykil> Someone look at my autocomplete example and tell me why the response function is never entered?  http://jsfiddle.net/785aX/1/
[09:56:57] <jeffsmykil> Please and thank you
[09:57:10] <james4765> nope - everything is called via javascript object calls
[09:57:20] <james4765> just a sec - need to deal with something
[09:57:33] <LindsayMac> k
[09:59:14] <jeffsmykil> Anyone familiar with jquery ui autocomplete?
[09:59:56] <Scott0_> can you post data with getJSON?
[10:00:02] <Scott0_> or should I just use .post?
[10:02:31] <tomfuertes> jeffsmykil: looks like response might not fire b/c you have a static source specified? Did you look at search in the docs? http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-search
[10:04:58] <rmill> wat
[10:07:29] <BillCriswell> Scott0_: $.post('/foo', { name: "Bill" }, function(result){ }); Woo
[10:07:37] <Scott0_> that's what I thought
[10:07:38] <Scott0_> thanks
[10:11:32] <james4765> LindsayMac: back. Short detour into Apache Solr. *twitch*
[10:14:27] <LindsayMac> james4765:  haha no prob.
[10:15:05] <james4765> feels like I'm juggling chainsaws and kittens here
[10:15:24] <james4765> and someone keeps trying to toss me a molotov cocktail just to make it interesting
[10:16:37] <LindsayMac> Hahaha that is a GREAT analogy
[10:17:49] <LindsayMac> I'm still stumped on this little issue where i'm loosing my :after class on my little ribbon http://jsfiddle.net/VhkZB/1/
[10:19:16] <james4765> oh damnit I think I found the culprit
[10:19:34] <LindsayMac> james4765:  was it an element that was too wide?
[10:19:39] <james4765> a utility method that was left behind to force the footer to go to the bottom of the page
[10:19:46] <james4765> it was force-resizing the content
[10:19:58] <james4765> from the detected screen width and height
[10:20:12] <james4765> but it wasn't updating the stored values on rotation
[10:20:27] <james4765> testing with that method defanged
[10:20:46] <james4765> we did not have a fun time getting this app together
[10:20:58] <Malvagio87> ugh i have no idea how to ask this question lol
[10:21:38] <james4765> that did it
[10:21:41] <james4765> ARGH
[10:21:53] <james4765> take out gun, aim at foot, fire repeatedly
[10:22:40] <james4765> that was left over from having to support OLD iOS devices
[10:22:58] <james4765> where the footer css wouldn't work right
[10:23:13] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: it vanishes when you hover over the :after portion
[10:23:40] <james4765> I want to get back to server side coding. Event-driven coding makes my head hurt
[10:23:47] <LindsayMac> haha james4765 .. I have FELT THAT PAIN
[10:24:11] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  actually it vanishes during an animation no matter where you hover
[10:24:21] <ryanneufeld> not for me
[10:24:26] <LindsayMac> james4765:  I am with ya on that..
[10:24:35] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  what are you using?
[10:24:38] <ryanneufeld> if I hold my mouse on the left side, it seems to remain
[10:24:40] <ryanneufeld> chrome
[10:24:49] <ryanneufeld> Version 24.0.1312.14 beta
[10:25:09] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  if you hold your mouse ont he left side it doesn't disappear and then reappear if you let it cycle all the way through>
[10:25:10] <LindsayMac> ??
[10:25:28] <ryanneufeld> seems intermittent
[10:26:01] <jessica_> i need 1 small help
[10:26:06] <jessica_> any1 there ?
[10:26:10] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  not for me. it disappears during animation no matter what. if you stop the animation in the middle of it (by mouseout) then the > disappears indefinitely
[10:26:37] <jessica_> what do you see here-  http://funiks.com/invoice/phonebook/search/returnresult.php
[10:26:56] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  you are right though.. if I hover in from the right side, its triggers it
[10:27:11] <LindsayMac> Resource id #2 jessica_
[10:27:36] <jessica_> whats wrong in my code
[10:27:49] <LindsayMac> jessica_:  let me consult my crystal ball
[10:27:52] <Malvagio87> i have a very long question ... should i post it in here or make a pastie of it and post the pastie
[10:28:09] <jessica_> http://pastebin.com/Vxw6Z18P
[10:28:15] <LindsayMac> Malvagio87:  paste it..
[10:28:21] <LindsayMac> that way you can refer to it again
[10:28:56] <jessica_> LindsayMac, its just  2 lines of code, i am not understanding whats goin wrong
[10:29:27] <LindsayMac> Ahh i think i see my issue.. is there a way to say "trigger when hover over .favRibbon but not favRibbon:after " ?
[10:29:52] <Saaether> jessica_  there is no jquery on that page at all, if you are looking php help you are in the wrong place
[10:30:00] <Malvagio87> here is my question everyone http://pastie.org/5407398 =) thanks you in advance for oyur help.
[10:30:22] <jessica_> i thought some1 here can help me with it
[10:30:47] <ryanneufeld> ?selectors @ LindsayMac

[10:31:24] <jessica_> php room needs invitation
[10:31:26] <jessica_> :(
[10:31:29] <andrew9184> try ##php
[10:31:47] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  AWESOME.. thanks
[10:31:54] <ryanneufeld> yup
[10:32:53] <jessica_> kk
[10:33:25] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  just gonna figure out how to apply it and I will be all good.
[10:33:39] <ryanneufeld> should be .not(
[10:33:46] <Malvagio87> anyone have any idea on how i could do that?
[10:33:55] <ryanneufeld> .not(":after") or something like that
[10:33:55] <b-ot> ryanneufeld, not tagged as amd within that containing module's build profile script?
[10:34:00] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  yea, but I need to make sure I'm firing it in the right place.
[10:34:21] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: and I'm also not sure about selecting of psudo classes, I've never done it YMMV
[10:34:24] <LindsayMac> I would have assumed https://gist.github.com/412f26292ae2ccab11fc but that aint right
[10:34:35] <qurve> Does jquery throw any global events for starting an animation and completing an animation? I have a use case where I need to know every time an animation starts and completes.
[10:34:50] <ryanneufeld> qurve: the answer to that is in the docs
[10:35:03] <qurve> I must have missed it, I swear I read them :)
[10:35:09] <ryanneufeld> it's there :)
[10:36:20] <qurve> Which part of the documentation? I've looked in effects, animate() specifically, and the events documentation.
[10:36:48] <black_warlock> hello peeps
[10:37:21] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  yea. i don't think it;s that because looking at what is happenign when the code is fired, there are no changes being made to the :after selector anyways, so making it .not(':after') may disable it from firing, but it wasn't doing anything in the first place.
[10:37:36] <LindsayMac> it seems as though changing the width is effecting it more than anything but i'm not sure
[10:37:45] <qurve> I mostly just want an equivalent of ajaxStart and ajaxStop so I can know the first time an animation starts and when there are no longer any running animations.
[10:37:47] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: yeah, if you had your console open you'd see "Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: unsupported pseudo: after"
[10:37:52] <ryanneufeld> from jquery
[10:38:27] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  yea. but what i was saying was that I don't think that is the corrent "problem" to solve anyways
[10:38:53] <ryanneufeld> qurve: http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/custom-effects/
[10:39:14] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: Maybe, but I'm out of ideas now. I suggest you just use a span instead of a pseudo element
[10:39:24] <LindsayMac> it weird, but it seems like hovering over the :after is actually triggering the animation backwards
[10:39:33] <qurve> Yeah, I've read that, although I'm not sure if that solves my problem, that could be my fault for not explaning clearly though
[10:40:00] <qurve> The problem is I need to globally track the start/stop of all animations, without knowing what they are or what initiated them, basically to keep a running count of active animations and triggering a behavior when the count is 0
[10:40:26] <qurve> (The actual use case is to set jQuery.fx.off = true and only set it to false within an animate() block)
[10:40:28] <ryanneufeld> qurve: http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[10:40:50] <black_warlock> who can help me with a little script ?
[10:41:02] <qurve> Thank you ryan, this looks more like what I'm looking for.
[10:41:10] <black_warlock> if anyone free take a look : http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/QbXeu/23/
[10:41:17] <qurve> Now to try it :)
[10:41:45] <black_warlock> how can i let the tail follow mouse when it is on the #navi
[10:41:50] <ryanneufeld> qurve: like I said, it was all there in the docs :)
[10:42:06] <qurve> Yeah, I unfortunately knew what I wanted but didn't know exactly where to look.
[10:42:09] <NeedHelp> Hello guys
[10:42:52] <ryanneufeld> Do you NeedHelp?
[10:43:06] <NeedHelp> Yes I do
[10:43:51] <NeedHelp> I know JQM at the moment does not support tabs but a temp fix has been found
[10:44:22] <NeedHelp> It involves replacing the JQMs collapsible and collapsible set widget
[10:44:43] <NeedHelp> But I don't know how to do this
[10:45:53] <NeedHelp> Are you able to help me with this?
[10:47:56] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  replaced :after with an empty <span> and still the same thing! This makes ZERO sense to me
[10:48:15] <NeedHelp> ?
[10:48:18] <ryanneufeld> well, I don't know much about the internals of animate, I'm sorry
[10:48:35] <ryanneufeld> ?ask @NeedHelp
[10:48:35] <bot-t> NeedHelp, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:48:57] <NeedHelp> I did ask
[10:49:48] <NeedHelp> Ok lets just start again
[10:50:09] <NeedHelp> I need to create tabs for jqm. Can someone help me?
[10:51:32] <ryanneufeld> NeedHelp: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/forms/radiobuttons/
[10:51:35] <ryanneufeld> you could use that
[10:51:58] <ryanneufeld> NeedHelp: its' all just css/js you can do what ever you need to with it
[10:52:12] <ryanneufeld> but coming up with a full solution for your problem isn't really what this channel is about
[10:52:20] <LindsayMac> So i still need some help from anyone familiar with .animate. For some reason I am loosing a css class that created the > of my ribbon (you will see in example) during animation. So the > disappears during animation and reappears if you let it animate all the way through. If you do not let it animate through, it disappears for good. http://jsfiddle.net/VhkZB/2/
[10:52:30] <ryanneufeld> NeedHelp: Go, try it, and then come with specific questions.
[10:53:04] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: try animating a wrapper instead of the content element
[10:53:25] <qurve> ryan, so in theory every single animation that ever fires for every element on the page will end up in $.queue("fx")? Is that a true statement? Or could they end up on other queues depending on how the animation is initiated?
[10:53:58] <qurve> Basically, I need to be able to respond to the start and stop of every animation that is ever fired on any element at any time globally.
[10:55:07] <qurve> The reason is that I want to be able to do something like this: $.fx.off = true; function allowAnimation(func) { $.fx.off = false; func(); $fx.fx.off = true; }
[10:55:11] <jmason> black_warlock: You need to put your javascript in a $(document).ready(...) or $(...)
[10:55:11] <ryanneufeld> qurve: I don't know see ?TIAS
[10:55:12] <bot-t> qurve, Try It And See
[10:55:29] <qurve> I have tried, I wouldn't be here asking if I had run out of known options :)
[10:55:41] <qurve> I just don't see queue working since it doesn't fire events.
[10:55:43] <qurve> Oh well.
[10:55:51] <ryanneufeld> ping gnarf some peeps having animation troubles in here.
[10:56:16] <gnarf> LindsayMac: jqueryui effect?
[10:56:30] <gnarf> LindsayMac: they use "wrapper divs" so CSS applied with > might break
[10:56:32] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  no. its a basic
[10:56:42] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  example here http://jsfiddle.net/VhkZB/2/
[10:56:54] <qurve> What I'm actually trying to do is globally disable animations, and then only turn them on when a component specifically creates a block, like window.allowAnimation(function() { // do lots of stuff });
[10:57:12] <qurve> More in line with how iOS animation blocks work.
[10:57:52] <gnarf> so whats getting lost?
[10:57:55] <qurve> Within the allowAnimation call box, fx are turned on, the callback runs, and when all animations initiated by the callback complete fx is turned back off.
[10:57:59] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  are you asking me ?
[10:58:03] <gnarf> yah
[10:58:12] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  basically when you hover, the <span> that makes the little > disappears during animation.
[10:58:29] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  if you let the animation complete, it will reappear, but if you pull out of the mouseover area before its done, its gone for good
[10:58:51] <gnarf> LindsayMac: when animating width - overflow:hidden is forced
[10:58:55] <gnarf> is that causing it?
[10:59:01] <LindsayMac> Oh possibly.
[10:59:12] <LindsayMac> can you "un force" it?
[10:59:43] <gnarf> yeah, just .css( "overflow", "" ) right after the anim starts
[10:59:45] <LindsayMac> is overflow:hidden only forced during animation?
[11:00:28] <gnarf> LindsayMac: yeah, unless you stop it early, in which case it stays there
[11:00:35] <LindsayMac> Ahhhh ..
[11:00:43] <LindsayMac> the answer is so simple.. yet such a pain to find!!
[11:00:56] <gnarf> 99% of the width/height animations NEED overflow:hidden
[11:00:57] <gnarf> :)
[11:01:15] <LindsayMac> yea makes sense i guess.
[11:01:44] <gnarf> LindsayMac: i thought you meant you were using a selector like ".someContainer > .someThing" to apply styles
[11:01:49] <Joeytje50> hey, is it possible to do something simple that will see if there is any element with attr data-foo="bar", case insensitive? $('[data-foo="bar"]').length works fine, but it's just case sensitive
[11:02:04] <gnarf> that can break with some jQuery UI effects because they "wrap" things inside another div to pull off the animation
[11:02:06] <Joeytje50> so is there something similar that works case insensitively
[11:02:22] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  well I was using :after to add the > but that was before i tried some debugging by replacing with an empty <span>
[11:02:27] <NoiseEee> Joeytje50: all your data- attributes should be lower case
[11:02:48] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  yea I kinda remember that issue that I had with JQUI in the past.
[11:02:58] <gnarf> LindsayMac: yeah - why not try animating the paddingLeft instead of the width?
[11:03:08] <black_warlock> jmason
[11:03:17] <gnarf> or are you using box-sizing: border-box
[11:03:18] <Joeytje50> NoiseEee: http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Exchange:Plank/Data#i=Oak plank,Teak plank,Mahogany plank the Remove items from graph: Oak plank, Teak plank, Mahogany plank
[11:03:21] <LindsayMac> gnarf: that would throw off the content inside of it.
[11:03:21] <black_warlock> you are right im sleeping
[11:03:27] <Joeytje50> those links have data-item="Oak plank"
[11:03:45] <Joeytje50> I need them to be case-sensitive, since the lowercase might be different than the uppercase
[11:03:55] <gnarf> LindsayMac: truth
[11:03:55] <^Mike\b> Is there a way to see if any event handlers are attached to some element in the DOM?
[11:04:05] <gnarf> LindsayMac: yeah, just .animate(...).css("overflow", "")
[11:04:08] <LindsayMac> haha.. I only speak in truths gnarf
[11:04:08] <gnarf> seems to fix it in the fiddle
[11:04:24] <Joeytje50> but I also need a way to check if data-item="oak plank", in any casing there is, already exists or not, before adding the other item to the graph
[11:04:25] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  yea.. but for some reason i'm still loosing it ont he backwards animation http://jsfiddle.net/VhkZB/3/
[11:04:32] <gnarf> need it there too
[11:04:39] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/VhkZB/4/
[11:04:52] <gnarf> also, those green shoes are awesome
[11:04:54] <LindsayMac> Ok I see.. i had mine in the wrong spot
[11:04:55] <gnarf> :)
[11:05:00] <LindsayMac> lol gnarf I agree!! I love them!
[11:05:27] <Joeytje50> is there a way to get an array of all the data-foo attributes of $('[data-foo]')?
[11:05:35] <gnarf> Joeytje50: see ?map
[11:05:35] <bot-t> Joeytje50, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[11:05:49] <gnarf> Joeytje50: or even see ?jQuery.map
[11:05:50] <bot-t> Joeytje50, jQuery.map(array, callback): Translate all items in an array or object to new array of items. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[11:05:51] <gnarf> either one
[11:06:32] <gnarf> jQuery.map( $('[data-foo]'), function( elem ) { return $( elem ).data( "foo" ); }) );
[11:06:35] <NoiseEee> Joeytje50: and just lowercase everything when you compare
[11:06:52] <Joeytje50> yea
[11:06:53] <gnarf> $('[data-foo]').map(function() { return $(this).data("foo"); }).get();
[11:06:57] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  you are my hero. If i ever find those green shoes, I will mail them to you
[11:06:59] <MistuhKurtz> anybody ever use sequence.js? http://www.sequencejs.com/
[11:07:12] <Joeytje50> gnarf: what does the .get() at the end add to it?
[11:07:16] <gnarf> ?get
[11:07:17] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[11:07:25] <gnarf> Joeytje50: turns it into a real array instead of a jQuery object
[11:07:34] <Joeytje50> ah
[11:07:44] <NoiseEee> also http://ajpiano.com/when-to-use-jquerys-map-methods/ @ Joeytje50
[11:07:52] <gnarf> jQuery.fn.map() returns an instanceof jQuery
[11:08:36] <gnarf> Joeytje50: if you don't really need it as an array, you can keep working with it as a jQuery, like run map again, or run each again
[11:08:38] <danzik17> qurve: assuming 1.8+, perhaps try something like this:  http://jsfiddle.net/67tu7/
[11:08:47] <gnarf> I actually have like a triple map inside jQuery UI effects core
[11:08:52] <gnarf> where it processes a bunch of elements
[11:09:07] <qurve> danzik17: I think that may be exactly what I was looking for.
[11:09:10] <Joeytje50> gnarf: I assume .indexOf('something') requires it to have .get()
[11:09:12] <Joeytje50> right?
[11:09:20] <gnarf> actually
[11:09:25] <qurve> Thank you a million times over, I couldn't find something like that anywhere.
[11:09:25] <gnarf> indexOf is broken in IE6
[11:09:29] <gnarf> on array
[11:09:33] <Joeytje50> ah well
[11:09:36] <gnarf> you might want to keep the jQuery and use ?index
[11:09:37] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[11:09:38] <hlve[omgbro]> omgbro
[11:09:43] <Joeytje50> my charts don't work fine in IE7 < anyway
[11:10:02] <ericw> I have an RSS news feed that generates within a div id "#conten_rssfeed" but none of the links open in a new window. The RSS feed loads about 5 seconds after the page loads and i need to figure out how to make jquery change the target="_self" to target="_blank"
[11:10:06] <ericw> I have an RSS news feed that generates within a div id "#conten_rssfeed" but none of the links open in a new window. The RSS feed loads about 5 seconds after the page loads and i need to figure out how to make jquery change the target="_self" to target="_blank"
[11:10:06] <gnarf> Joeytje50: there is .index( ) on a jQuery which does the same thing tho, skip the conversion step
[11:10:14] <gnarf> LindsayMac: size 10 :)
[11:10:15] <Joeytje50> ah ok
[11:10:46] <ericw> any suggestions?
[11:11:41] <gnarf> ericw: $("#conten_rssfeed").on("click", "a[target='_self']", function() { this.target = "_blank"; }); ?
[11:11:45] <danzik17> qurve: one change, use this:  http://jsfiddle.net/67tu7/1/    - the event should be trigger on elem not doc so bubbling works, but yea.
[11:12:04] <Joeytje50> gnarf: http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Exchange:Plank/Data#i=Oak_plank,Teak_plank,Mahogany_plank on there, I ran $('[data-item]').map(function() { return $(this).data("item").toLowerCase(); }).index('oak plank')
[11:12:07] <Joeytje50> and it returned -1
[11:12:16] <qurve> Rad, I'm trying ot get this implemented now.
[11:12:27] <Joeytje50> it should return 0, since the first [data-item] on the page is data-item="Oak plank"
[11:12:40] <Joeytje50> what goes wrong there?
[11:13:01] <qurve> The problem I have is with a huge JS app (170+ classes, it's silly) and I have items being shown/hidden based on data binding, but I don't want the animations to fire during constructors/initialization blocks, only when changes happen based on user interaction..
[11:13:29] <qurve> I want all the code to be written to utilize animations, but only have the animations actually work when something explicitly allows it.
[11:13:37] <qurve> I'll let you know if this works :)
[11:13:41] <ericw> gnarf: thanks but how can I get that to load after my RSS feed loads? because the RSS feed loads about 5 seconds after the page loads
[11:13:42] <gnarf> Joeytje50: i'm not getting the data...
[11:13:59] <Joeytje50> what does your error console say?
[11:14:06] <gnarf> ericw: so, the way that works, is it binds to the #conten_rssfeed already in the document
[11:14:12] <gnarf> ericw: you can bind it to a higher container
[11:14:15] <gnarf> but really
[11:14:25] <gnarf> best performance is to bind it to the closest possible thing
[11:14:36] <ericw> the a href doesn't exist until after the rss feed loads 100% (5 seconds later)
[11:14:39] <gnarf> ericw: $(document).on("click", "#content_rssfeed a[target='_self']", function() { this.target = "_blank"; }); ?
[11:14:53] <gnarf> ericw: does the #content_rssfeed exist?
[11:14:59] <gnarf> because if it does, thats where you are binding the event
[11:15:02] <ericw> yes
[11:15:05] <gnarf> events bubble
[11:15:09] <gnarf> so when you click the a
[11:15:18] <gnarf> it goes up and finds the click handler on #conten_rssfeed
[11:15:40] <gnarf> checks the [optional] selector --- "a[target='_self']" vs what was clicked
[11:15:42] <gnarf> and runs the handler
[11:15:50] <donahchoo> hey, I have a JQuery 1.8.2 scope question.
[11:16:00] <ericw> i'll give that a try
[11:16:14] <gnarf> ericw: use the $("#conten_rss").on(...)
[11:16:17] <gnarf> not the document one
[11:16:34] <gnarf> cuz its gonna be better, binding to document will do a bunch of extra processing for every click on the page
[11:16:36] <gnarf> silly
[11:16:36] <donahchoo> if I do:  $('document').ready( function() {console.log(this)});
[11:16:40] <Leukocyt> $(document).ready(function() {
[11:16:40] <Leukocyt> 	$('#content_rssfeed a[target="_self]').attr('target','_blank');
[11:16:40] <Leukocyt> });
[11:16:42] <donahchoo> this is an instance of HTMLDocument
[11:16:44] <Leukocyt> try that
[11:16:47] <Leukocyt> Will work
[11:16:54] <gnarf> Leukocyt: no, it wont
[11:16:59] <donahchoo> I would have expected it to be the global DOMWindow
[11:17:05] <gnarf> because even when doc is read, #conten_rssfeed has no content for it to find
[11:17:34] <gnarf> Leukocyt: you either have to delegate events, or perform that operation in the ajax callback where you are loading the content into the page
[11:17:37] <donahchoo> is JQuery doing something to make the HTMLDocument this inside the function instead of the DOMWindow?
[11:18:23] <gnarf> ericw: ^^^ there is another option too --- which is after you append the content, in your ajax callback, do the $("#conten_rssfeed a").attr('target', '_blank');
[11:18:59] <gnarf> donahchoo: why, you bound to the document
[11:19:46] <gnarf> donahchoo: "this" is the object triggering the event in an event handler
[11:20:25] <gnarf> donahchoo: $("a").click(function() { console.log(this); }) will give you an HTMLAnchorElement for instance
[11:20:36] <donahchoo> okay, that makes since
[11:20:38] <ericw> hm, ok let me play with it and i'll let you know if i have any questions. :)
[11:20:39] <ericw> ty
[11:20:51] <donahchoo> thx
[11:20:51] <gnarf> donahchoo: ajax callbacks, "this" is the options object
[11:21:12] <gnarf> donahchoo: each/map callbacks - this is usually the element in the array
[11:21:24] <gnarf> some things can't be a "this" tho, like a string
[11:21:27] <gnarf> or a number
[11:21:50] <donahchoo> right, "string" or new String("foo")?
[11:21:54] <gnarf> so in each/map its usually best to use the function arguments
[11:22:06] <gnarf> instead of this at all
[11:22:21] <gnarf> in general, why would you be referencing "this" anyway in a dom ready?
[11:22:38] <donahchoo> I just trying to get a better understanding of scope
[11:22:40] <chilversc> hmm, seems jquery ui and knockout arn't going to play nice
[11:22:56] <gnarf> donahchoo: see ?101
[11:22:56] <bot-t> donahchoo, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[11:23:06] <gnarf> donahchoo: there is a great section in eloquent about scope
[11:23:16] <donahchoo> I've ready parts of it.
[11:23:23] <gnarf> donahchoo: "this" is more about "context" than "scope" though
[11:23:37] <donahchoo> I need to actually write tests though to understand it.
[11:23:45] <donahchoo> good point about context
[11:23:48] <gnarf> scope is like visibility - what variables can you see
[11:24:01] <gnarf> "this" is just one of the things in your scope... the "context" of the call
[11:25:10] <gnarf> any function, when executed, creates a new scope containing its arguments and variables and also any scopes it is defined inside of.
[11:25:21] <Joeytje50> gnarf: http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Exchange:Plank/Data#i=Oak_plank,Teak_plank,Mahogany_plank I've fixed the error, it should work now: $('[data-item]').map(function() { return $(this).data("item").toLowerCase(); }).index('oak plank')
[11:25:41] <Joeytje50> so that returns -1 while it should return 0, since the first [data-item] is "Oak plank"
[11:25:41] <gnarf> Joeytje50: "Loading..."
[11:25:51] <gnarf> Joeytje50: what does just the map return ?
[11:25:54] <Joeytje50> yeah clear your cache, I've only just updated it
[11:25:57] <lduros> hi, I'm using $('iframe').detach().prependTo('body') to move an iframe from a given div to being the first element in the <body> tag. The problem I have is that the iframe is reloaded when you do that, is there a way to move the iframe from one spot in the dom to another without reloading the iframe?
[11:26:08] <ericw> thanks gnarf, that works.
[11:26:30] <ericw> i had something similar to that before but I think i may have had it in the wrong place. lol
[11:26:53] <gnarf> Joeytje50: sorry, forgot index doesn't work with strings
[11:27:18] <gnarf> $('[data-item]').map(function() { return $(this).data("item").toLowerCase(); }).get().indexOf( "oak plank" ) for instance gives 0
[11:27:21] <Joeytje50> but $('[data-item]').map(function() { return $(this).data("item").toLowerCase(); }) returns ["oak plank", "teak plank", "mahogany plank", "plank"]
[11:27:27] <Joeytje50> when I put it in my console
[11:27:44] <gnarf> Joeytje50: if you pass a string to .index() it assumes its a CSS selector
[11:27:49] <gnarf> Joeytje50: sorry, forgot about that
[11:27:50] <Malvagio87> here is my question everyone http://pastie.org/5407398 =) thanks you in advance for oyur help.
[11:27:58] <gnarf> there is jQuery.inArray also
[11:28:10] <gnarf> Joeytje50: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[11:28:24] <qurve> danzik17: For some reason it seems like the start override never gets called in this.
[11:28:29] <docmur> If I have this form: http://pastebin.com/A4tsv3ge  How can I serialize the data,  I tried $("#formId").serializer() but it appears to give me no data back.
[11:28:34] <gnarf> jQuery.inArray( "oak plank",  $('[data-item]').map(function() { return $(this).data("item").toLowerCase(); }) );
[11:28:53] <Joeytje50> ah, $.inArray('oak plank',$('[data-item]').map(function() { return $(this).data("item").toLowerCase(); })) does work
[11:28:55] <Joeytje50> thanks gnarf
[11:28:57] <qurve> Chances are I boned something up, but are you sure that should work that way?
[11:29:41] <[Jasper]> hej guys, is there a way to dynamically load js and css ?
[11:29:50] <[Jasper]> if I have the js and css in variables?
[11:29:54] <[Jasper]> instead of files
[11:31:55] <danzik17> qurve: looks like its working to me:  http://jsfiddle.net/67tu7/3/
[11:32:24] <qurve> Friggin weird, must have boned something.
[11:32:29] <qurve> Thanks again.
[11:32:50] <qurve> In my setup the prefilter gets called, but the start/done callbacks never do.
[11:33:54] <qurve> My implementation is even simpler: $.Animation.prefilter(function() { animationCount++; @.then(function() { animationCount--; } })
[11:34:04] <qurve> The animation count goes up, but it never goes down.
[11:34:18] <qurve> Tried using this.then(), this.done(), this.promise().then(), etc.
[11:34:51] <qurve> I ultimately don't need to manipulate the animation in any way, I just need to count them up, then count them back down so I can trigger some code when the count drops back to 0.
[11:34:59] <[Jasper]> anyone who knows the answer?
[11:35:36] <Joeytje50> ?data
[11:35:36] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[11:36:03] <Joeytje50> um, where's the reference to $('body').data('foo')
[11:36:16] <Joeytje50> oh nvm
[11:39:54] <[Jasper]> hej guys, is there a way to dynamically load js and css ?
[11:40:10] <netzapper> Can anybody help me with the jQuery.parseJSON in this page <http://webdev.justtactics.com/purchase>? It does the XHR request, and logs what JSONlint says is valid JSON. And yet $.parseJSON() always returns null. (Sorry if this is trivial stuff. I'm only an emergency front-end programmer.)
[11:40:12] <[Jasper]> where the javascript and css source is sent via a socket instead of being stored in a file?
[11:40:41] <qurve> What is the expected return value of $.Animate.prefilter()? I think that may be why my thing is breaking.
[11:42:21] <BD-> noob question: i'm trying to iterate over a set of elements (a's) using a selector and .each() with a simple function that calls 'hasClass()' and 'addClass()'. This outputs an error: "Uncaught TypeError: Object http://localhost/fotogiesels/?gallery_id=4 has no method 'hasClass' " as if i'm trying to call the functions on the inner html of the <a> element instead of the element itself
[11:42:32] <BD-> code is something like this: $('a[id^="menu_gallery"][id!="menu_gallery_' + activeGallery + '"]').each(function() { if (this.hasClass('selected-gallery')) {
[11:42:32] <qurve> danzik17: I figured it out, if prefilter() returns anything except undefined, it cancels the animation apparently.
[11:42:44] <qurve> Since I was converting your code to coffeescript and getting an implicit return it didn't work.
[11:43:46] <qurve> Rather, if it returns a non-false-like value it kills the animation
[11:45:55] <BD-> is my question so stupid that it's not worth answering ? :(
[11:46:22] <warrenparsons> BD-: Try using $(this).hasClassâ€¦ instead of this.hasClass
[11:47:05] <warrenparsons> BD-: As it is, you're trying to run a jQuery method on a non-jQuery object.
[11:47:13] <BD-> yes, that's it, thanks warrenparsons ! :D
[11:47:22] <BD-> i see !!
[11:47:30] <warrenparsons> BD-: Also, you don't need the + "'
[11:47:52] <BD-> damn, jquery is so cool :')
[11:48:45] <[Jasper]> is there anyone here that can give me an answer about h ow to load css and js dynamically?
[11:48:49] <[Jasper]> or is this not possible?\
[11:49:06] <chandu> hello, can anyone tell me why the thumbnails in the corner scrolling so fast when you click on an arrow http://198.58.86.52/~rondaf/gallery/under-water/
[11:50:21] <zhulikas> [Jasper], require.js
[11:54:22] <JessC> @[Jasper] You can insert a css script tag into the header, but i'm not 100% sure if it will update
[11:58:30] <danzik17> qurve: makes sense.  yay for CS breaking things :(
[11:58:53] <qurve> danzik17: This absolutely solved my problem, I gotta work out my implementation, but this was the hook into the animation internals I was looking for.
[11:58:57] <qurve> Thanks again.
[11:59:29] <[Jasper]> zhulikas it's not stored in files
[11:59:33] <[Jasper]> so I can't use require.js
[11:59:42] <[Jasper]> I need to dynamically add javascript with jquery
[11:59:47] <zhulikas> you can use require.js to refer remote files
[11:59:52] <jrodl3r> ding
[12:00:22] <[Jasper]> yes zhulikas
[12:00:24] <chandu> ?
[12:00:27] <[Jasper]> I don't have remote files
[12:00:32] <[Jasper]> I'm getting javascript via a socket
[12:00:35] <dJquery> it seems that the new jqueryui site doesnt have a listing of the different css classes anymore
[12:00:41] <zhulikas> oh, that's different :)
[12:00:42] <[Jasper]> so I have the code for the javascript in a variable
[12:00:45] <[Jasper]> yes it is :P
[12:00:52] <zhulikas> so, a socket
[12:00:56] <[Jasper]> so is there a way too add this?
[12:00:57] <chandu>  hello, can anyone tell me why the thumbnails in the corner scrolling so fast when you click on an arrow http://198.58.86.52/~rondaf/gallery/under-water/
[12:00:57] <zhulikas> socket.io or a regular socket?
[12:01:02] <[Jasper]> socket.io
[12:01:13] <zhulikas> you may evaluate your received javascript
[12:01:17] <zhulikas> but be careful
[12:01:29] <zhulikas> also
[12:01:34] <zhulikas> why the hell does it work that way
[12:01:45] <zhulikas> I believe there is a fundamental problem to this approach
[12:01:55] <zhulikas> as in you should never need to do anything this crazy
[12:02:18] <Malvagio87> it is simply amazxing how many assholes there are on "help" cahnnels in irc lol
[12:02:24] <danzik17> [Jasper]: see ?globalEval , but it does seem weird to eval JS sent down via sockets tbh.
[12:02:25] <bot-t> [Jasper], jQuery.globalEval(code): Execute some JavaScript code globally. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.globalEval/
[12:02:27] <Malvagio87> how miserable are there lives?'
[12:03:00] <zhulikas> Malvagio87, :)
[12:03:05] <chandu> mal ?
[12:03:34] <ericw> gnarf: you around? lol
[12:03:44] <Malvagio87> hi chandu
[12:03:54] <ericw> now i realized i need a more link
[12:03:59] <dJquery> i.e. this page used to exist and is gone. http://jqueryui.com/Theming/API
[12:04:04] <ericw> but my rss feed is being drawn
[12:04:05] <Malvagio87> so im trying to do a search function on my website and im not sure hwoto go about doing it
[12:04:10] <chandu> you a president or what
[12:04:29] <ericw> feedControl.draw(document.getElementById("contet_rssfeed"));
[12:04:43] <dJquery> grr and its not in the way back machine either
[12:04:50] <ericw> i need to throw in a <a href="url">More</a> at the end
[12:05:06] <ericw> i'm unfamiliar with .draw
[12:05:11] <Malvagio87> does anyone know how i can do that?
[12:05:20] <chandu> yes
[12:05:33] <Malvagio87> chandu, can you lkink me to somewhere i can look
[12:05:58] <chandu> ok
[12:06:51] <Malvagio87> http://173.201.188.162/mcmmo/ is the site im creating
[12:07:02] <Malvagio87> i essentially want to be able to do a search via the username
[12:07:05] <dJquery> Malvagio87: well we could help you throw a search button and a text box on the page but you would need to impliment the actual search in the back end. you arent giving us anything to go on and the back endstuff is off topic hear
[12:07:38] <dJquery> well thats a little different
[12:07:54] <Malvagio87> but dJquery you are probably right
[12:08:00] <dJquery> Malvagio87: http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2012/05/jquery-filter-sort-plugins.html
[12:08:12] <Malvagio87> because i want it to output just the row with that players username
[12:08:29] <dJquery> since all the stuff is allready displayed and there is not a ton of info you could do it with any number of plugins easily
[12:08:55] <Malvagio87> i use tablesorter already
[12:09:52] <[Jasper]> zhulikas why is it a weird approach?
[12:10:14] <halcyon1234> jquerymobile: If I want to capture a swipe anywhere on the screen, is it okay to do $(document).bind("swipeleft"), or is there a better element to bind to?
[12:11:22] <zhulikas> [Jasper], it just sounds fundamentaly wrong :)))
[12:11:23] <zhulikas> nothing more
[12:11:41] <zhulikas> ok, off for 50minutes
[12:11:43] <zhulikas> dota 2 o/
[12:11:53] <[Jasper]> trying something new zhulikas
[12:12:10] <danheberden> halcyon1234: capturing events on document is totally acceptable
[12:12:16] <chandu> hello, can anyone tell me why the thumbnails in the corner scrolling so fast when you click on an arrow http://198.58.86.52/~rondaf/gallery/under-water/
[12:14:54] <docmur> If I wanted to take the value of a box testBox.val() and multiple that result by 5 I could do testBox.val() * 5, how can I then add a constant value to it use + wont work
[12:16:02] <dJquery> chandu: most likely the developer of the supersized plugin that you are using could answer that
[12:16:18] <dJquery> have you checked to see what other options are available for it?
[12:18:11] <dJquery> docmur:    var    staticNum = 3,  tb = $('#testBox'), v = (tb.val() * 5) + staticNum;
[12:20:17] <docmur> Okay, would it be possible to do that in a val statment like cost.val("" + ( x.val() * 50 ).math('+', 50 ) + "")
[12:20:45] <chandu> djquery: i checked everywhere no sign of it
[12:22:48] <firstclassfunc> I want to add event listeners to jQuery objects BEFORE I add them to the DOM. How can I do this?
[12:22:55] <firstclassfunc> without using live()
[12:23:08] <docmur> got it
[12:23:30] <docmur> This is what I was trying to do: dist.attr("checked")?cost.val(""+ (( noc.val() * 5 ) + 50 )+""):cost.val(""+noc.val() * 5+"");
[12:23:54] <warrenparsons> firstclassfunc: Look up the .on method, using event delegation.
[12:23:59] <warrenparsons> ? on
[12:24:00] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:24:47] <firstclassfunc> warrenparsons: hmm, I figured as much. thanks
[12:26:00] <warrenparsons> firstclassfunc: $('#wrapper').on('click', 'a.new', function(){â€¦}) will attach a click event handler to every a.new inside #wrapper, regardless of when that a.new is loaded into the page.
[12:27:43] <firstclassfunc> warrenparsons: ok, great, thanks
[12:45:46] <halcyon1234> jqm: I can't seem to get persistant header and footer bars working. I've given them both the same data-id: http://jsbin.com/efekep/1/
[12:46:42] <halcyon1234> In that jsbin, the header and footer transition with the page
[12:47:34] <ericw> http://pastebin.com/Sg4wFAHN
[12:47:49] <ericw> How can i add a "more" button after the feed.Control.draw?
[12:48:05] <ericw> feedControl.draw*
[12:48:21] <firstclassfunc> $.when.apply(null, deferreds).done(callback); -- what does this do?
[12:49:15] <firstclassfunc> err..
[12:49:37] <firstclassfunc> I know it calls the callback when all the deferreds are done (a few $.get() calls), but what is actually being called here?
[12:50:07] <shoky> firstclassfunc:  calls $.when(deffered1, deferred2, ...).done(callback)   where deferred1, 2, etc are the deferreds in the array
[12:50:22] <ericw> actually jk
[12:50:24] <ericw> lol
[12:50:29] <ericw> i don't know why i didn't see that before
[12:50:31] <ericw> i got it
[12:51:08] <blink> Hello could some tell me how can i add finish to this for the forever scroll http://jsfiddle.net/GbVL3/ i would really appreciate since its working but it wont show when it ends
[12:51:56] <shoky> firstclassfunc: .apply is the javascript way to call a function with an arguments array.  the null serves as the 'this' context for that call to $.when. its null because $.when doesn't care about 'this'
[12:52:12] <dJquery> how would you select all the time inputs?
[12:52:32] <blink> hey shoky
[12:52:50] <shoky> hiya
[12:53:00] <blink> how you been ?
[12:53:26] <firstclassfunc> shoky: OK, thanks. semantics confused me there
[12:53:32] <shoky> busy moving, but that's mostly done by now
[12:53:32] <shoky> sup
[12:54:36] <bil`> Is there a way to turn off events by their namespace regardless of the selector?
[12:54:40] <blink> cool im just busy working on the site, almost done its just gonna take a while to test everything, but i need little bit of help if your free
[12:54:46] <ericw> excellent, now nothing to do for the next 4 hours
[12:54:54] <bil`> like $.off('.namespace')
[12:55:15] <blink> i have forever scroll in a lot of pages it does work perfectly fine but it never says when it is the end of it
[12:55:39] <shoky> blink: try fleshing out the fiddle, put some html/css in there, choose jquery on the left so it actually runs, demonstrate the issue
[12:56:04] <blink> ok one moment
[12:57:08] <Pro|> how to do x if anything changes on document

[13:13:52] <anli_> Is it possible to have a circular mask on top of an image?
[13:14:08] <anli_> Does that maybe require <canvas>?
[13:15:18] <systemfault> I think webkit-based browsers can do that using CSS
[13:15:27] <anli_> mask-image
[13:15:28] <anli_> hm
[13:15:41] <anli_> Seems to be for a lot of browsers
[13:15:46] <anli_> http://trentwalton.com/2011/05/19/mask-image-text/
[13:15:56] <anli_> hm, maybe only for text then

[13:23:08] <jcrawford> hey guys is there a function in jquery that will pick up on changes to elements?  I have a ul of error messages and I want it to fade out every-time a message is added, however I don't want to have to manually fade it out every-time I add a message to the element
[13:23:26] <jcrawford> i know there is onchange but think that is for form elements?
[13:27:13] <anli_> Wow, in chrome, it mask-image works
[13:27:19] <anli_> Or if it is -webkit-mask-image
[13:29:16] <blink> i have to go :/ brb later got call for work
[13:30:53] <hyper_ch> hmmmm, I tried to make an onchange event on some text file that should issue an ajax call. I tried to parse the change with onchange and a custom js function, I tried to use jquery .change.... it works all fine in firefox but not in chrome and chromium
[13:34:15] <anli_> Is there a way to check if the browser supports a certain style?
[13:36:08] <BillCriswell> anli_: Are you using modernizr?
[13:36:16] <anli_> no
[13:36:30] <anli_> Maybe just setting a style and check if it sticks is a way
[13:36:38] <BillCriswell> Hmm.. what are you trying to detect?
[13:36:46] <BillCriswell> That's essentially what modernizr does.
[13:36:53] <anli_> Well, there are already ways of detecting webkit, I use that instead
[13:36:59] <anli_> $.browser.webkit
[13:37:02] <dJquery> hate working with dates in js
[13:37:20] <BillCriswell> That's UA sniffing verse feature detection though.
[13:37:54] <dJquery> ?browser
[13:37:54] <bot-t> jQuery.browser: Contains flags for the useragent, read from navigator.userAgent. We recommend against using this property; please try to use feature detection instead (see jQuery.support). jQuery.browser may be moved to a plugin in a future release of jQuery. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
[13:38:01] <acidjazz> whats hte best way in jquery in a function to detect wether im fired from an event or just called
[13:39:34] <kborchers> anli_: you should try to not use $.browser since it is deprecated http://api.jquery.com/category/deprecated/
[13:39:46] <anli_> ok
[13:40:01] <anli_> Well, would be better to check if a certain style is in use
[13:40:23] <kontoo> acidjazz: check parameters?
[13:41:45] <acidjazz> kenperkins: wll im passing an object
[13:41:51] <acidjazz> kenperkins: as a parameter..
[13:41:56] <kenperkins> ?
[13:41:56] <acidjazz> kenperkins: maybe look for 'event' ?
[13:42:02] <kenperkins> i think you mean kborchers
[13:42:27] <kborchers> ?
[13:42:35] <kenperkins> or kontoo rather
[13:42:41] <kborchers> :D
[13:43:00] <kontoo> total_confusion();
[13:43:25] <acidjazz> kontoo: my parameter is an object
[13:43:29] <BillCriswell> anli_: http://jsbin.com/welcome/51673/edit I think this is basically what modernizr would do, just more thoroughly.
[13:43:41] <kontoo> well events are also just function calls. i'm not a jquery expert but i would check for the parameters, like you said, check for "event"
[13:44:21] <BillCriswell> anli_: I think a browser that doesn't understand border-radius won't return anything.
[13:44:32] <kontoo> can you explain what you want to do in specific? often there is a better solution that avoids ugly hacks
[13:44:57] <BillCriswell> Yeah, if you change 'border-radius' to 'border-radiuss' in both cases it returns undefined... at least in chrome.
[13:45:59] <anli_> yeah
[13:46:07] <anli_> Like I thought
[13:46:14] <anli_> hm, cant set mask position
[13:46:32] <anli_> trying to use -webkit-mask-origin
[13:47:49] <anli_> ah, its -webkit-mask-position
[13:51:29] <BillCriswell> Modernizr.testAllProps('maskPosition') could do it.
[13:52:05] <acidjazz> kontoo: i basically have this function bound to a click event.. but i also would like to call it myself and pass params to it
[13:52:57] <systemfault> acidjazz: you can use .trigger to fire the event and pass data at the same time
[13:54:07] <BillCriswell> anli_: That way if -moz- or -ms- or whatever gets it it'll still be AOK.
[13:54:44] <anli_> http://62.168.145.82/test/mask-image/
[13:54:46] <anli_> :)
[13:54:49] <anli_> only in chrome
[13:55:39] <BillCriswell> oooo that's fun.
[13:55:55] <anli_> :)
[13:56:01] <kontoo> acidjazz: it still sounds to me that you are trying to do something conceptually wrong. try to seperate your "business logic" from the actual click event, it's not a good practise to mix this two concerns
[13:56:02] <anli_> You may guess that I love my own photo
[13:56:21] <BillCriswell> Any man who wears a bow-tie is ok in my book.
[13:56:29] <anli_> hehehe
[13:56:35] <BillCriswell> Andr 3000 wears a bow-tie as well.
[13:56:51] <acidjazz> kontoo hmm good point
[13:58:01] <BillCriswell> Andre* even
[13:58:46] <hyper_ch> I found my problem now. the onchange event isn't trigered in chrome when autocomplete from jqueryui is used and one of the drop down entries selected. How would I now trigger a custom function when the user selects an option from the dropdown provided by autocomplete
[13:58:59] <anli_> BillCriswell: I updated the title on that webpage
[13:59:13] <BillCriswell> I like it.
[13:59:22] <anli_> :)
[13:59:34] <javalover> ok so i've used .load on divs and stuff
[13:59:46] <javalover> but right now I just want to call the load part...basically I want to execute a php file on button click
[14:01:18] <BillCriswell> javalover: $.get('file.php'); on a click event.
[14:01:24] <NoiseEee> javalover: then you're just looking for either .get or .ajax
[14:01:46] <javalover> oh ic....
[14:01:52] <javalover> so load is literally if you have data to put inside something
[14:01:53] <javalover> thx
[14:02:59] <BillCriswell> $('.fill-me').load('file.php') is basically the same as $.get('file.php', function(result){ $('.fill-me').html(result); });
[14:03:55] <anli_> Does browsers display svg correctly nowadays?
[14:04:28] <JessC> @anli_ Depends on the browser, chrome does a decent job
[14:04:36] <JessC> good luck if you are in IE land
[14:04:45] <anli_> hehe
[14:05:02] <BillCriswell> anli_: Modernizr.svg =)
[14:05:19] <anli_> hehe
[14:05:33] <anli_> oh, was writing that
[14:06:17] <JessC> @javalover .load can also load sections of a page that is loaded so if you have div with an id and you want to load that portion into your page you would do $('#something').load('page.html#div'), if you pass load a function it will bind to the load event which is different than read()
[14:06:43] <JessC> ready*
[14:08:18] <xp_prg> I want to get all dom elements with #some1_some2_ at the beginning, I try this:  $("id=^'some1_some2').html() but nothing returns, what am I doing wrong?
[14:08:55] <ksweeney> you need to use the attribute selector xp_prg
[14:09:10] <JessC> but if its an id there should only be 1
[14:09:19] <ksweeney> $('[id=^"some1_some2"]')
[14:09:21] <JessC> $("#some1_some2");
[14:09:21] <BillCriswell> xp_prg: You forgot the []
[14:09:23] <ksweeney> that too
[14:09:42] <xp_prg> hmm... ok BillyCrystal, I will try that
[14:09:42] <kontoo> JessC: he seems to mean 1_1, 1_2, 2_1 etc
[14:11:02] <xp_prg> ksweeney is the closest to what I want
[14:11:16] <xp_prg> how do I count all found elements is it .length() ?
[14:11:26] <JessC> just .length
[14:11:31] <JessC> no parenthesis
[14:12:52] <JessC> and if you have more than one match you will have to iterate through each one to get .html()
[14:13:53] <BillCriswell> xp_prg: Haha.
[14:14:07] <BillCriswell> I get called "Clark Grizwald" a lot as well.
[14:14:42] <BillCriswell> Griswold*
[14:15:07] <BillCriswell> JessC: Unless you do like  .html(function(){ return 'New HTMLZ!'; });
[14:15:14] <xp_prg> its working!!!!
[14:15:15] <BillCriswell> Net Split oh noes.
[14:15:22] <xp_prg> I heart you all
[14:15:59] <xp_prg> now if I only knew how to write asynchronous javascript and test it with phantomjs
[14:17:14] <BillCriswell> That's one of those things I probably know how to do and don't realize I know how to do till I make myself look dumb in front of people.
[14:17:27] <BillCriswell> Expert at that.
[14:19:23] <DyeA> Isn't there a method to append content to the dom and return the appended content in one step, so as not to have to append and then do a query for the appended element? i.e. el = $('body').appendTo('<div>hi</div>')?
[14:19:44] <kontoo> xp_prg: what do you mean by async js btw?
[14:19:59] <xp_prg> stuff that runs in such a way that doesn't lock up the ui
[14:20:19] <xp_prg> basically clsoures, callbacks, and set_timeout garbage all day long
[14:20:21] <NoiseEee> xp_prg: javascript is async by nature
[14:20:29] <NoiseEee> xp_prg: unless you're doing something terribly wrong
[14:20:29] <xp_prg> its single threaded :(
[14:20:47] <BillCriswell> xp_prg: NoiseEee will drop some knowledge. Always does haha.
[14:20:48] <hyper_ch> NoiseEee: in a strict sense, isn't everything async?
[14:20:48] <xp_prg> NoiseEee don't make noise about stuff you don't understand please
[14:21:07] <kontoo> NoiseEee: you can block script execution
[14:21:32] <BillCriswell> DyeA: You want to do things on the <div>Hi</div>?
[14:21:36] <NoiseEee> geniusCount++
[14:21:45] <kontoo> NoiseEee: place a while true loop inside your script :)
[14:22:03] <kontoo> xp_prg: you heard about web workers?
[14:22:14] <xp_prg> yes but they are not a standard yet ;(
[14:22:34] <DyeA> BillCriswell: yes
[14:22:57] <JessC> @xp_prg web standards aren't that importantâ€¦ask Microsoft ;)
[14:23:16] <DyeA> BillCriswell: I swear i have seen this in perf tips articles
[14:23:17] <ksweeney1> hahaha
[14:24:37] <kontoo> JessC: i heard rumors about Microsoft not being someone to get advise from in that specific topic ;)
[14:25:10] <BillCriswell> DyeA: http://jsbin.com/aqokib/1/edit like this?
[14:25:51] <BillCriswell> DyeA: Not sure how to make the HTML, Javascript, Console and Outputs visible to you with the link.
[14:25:59] <JessC> @kontoo I guess it depends on what kind of advise you want...
[14:26:20] <BillCriswell> Actually... don't even need the HTML panel there.
[14:26:46] <kontoo> xp_prg: well if you don't do heavy computation in js then you won't encounter problems with the 1 thread execution. thing is, as soon as concurrency comes into play it gets hairy, very in contrast to the purpose of an easy to use language for "non technicans"
[14:27:25] <kontoo> xp_prg: do you have any specific problem btw. you want to address?
[14:28:13] <kontoo> JessC: hmmm maybe i would ask them about block layouts no one needs ;)
[14:29:13] <JessC> @kontoo if you haven't used sharepoint you ain't seen nothingâ€¦
[14:29:24] <kontoo> JessC: lol
[14:29:41] <JessC> I'd rather write apps for blackberry than go back to that
[14:30:03] <kontoo> JessC: we switched our company intranet to sharepoint... whole of a mess, runs only well in internet explorer. work mates cursing about complexity of that beast
[14:30:05] <DyeA> BillCriswell: well that works but still involves an extra step of creating a dom fragment and then appending rather than going straight from a string to dom insertion. Also you could save a step there as well by inserting the text content into the div prior to turning it into a fragment.
[14:30:14] <sethetter> JessC: My company's intranet runs on sharepoint, luckily I dont' have to touch it
[14:30:24] <DyeA> BillCriswell: but lacking what I was wanting i think your solution is the next best thing
[14:30:31] <DyeA> bil
[14:30:47] <NCS_One> hi
[14:31:05] <NCS_One> how can I select using a property?
[14:31:23] <DyeA> BillCriswell: and thats what I was wanting to do was come back around and attache an event listener
[14:31:30] <kontoo> Hilarious that they bring IE10 commercials even in the cinema about how great the browser is and standards and bla but sharepoint doesn't conform to web standards
[14:31:48] <JessC> @kontoo @sethetter I had to admin it for one company because I was the "Tech guy so he must know sharepoint" and developing for that feels like someone at microsoft said "Hey I like this cool app based web sites, lets use 1995 technology/techniques to emulate that!"
[14:32:02] <DyeA> BillCriswell: close button on dynamically generated modal HTML
[14:32:04] <JessC> @NCS_One What are you trying to do?
[14:32:10] <JessC> do you have an example
[14:32:35] <BillCriswell> DyeA: Nice.
[14:32:49] <NCS_One> JessC: I'm trying to get all radio elements that are checked
[14:32:56] <BillCriswell> There was something nice I saw the other day for that DyeA. Really light weird... can't find it now.
[14:34:09] <sethetter> NCS_One: $("input[type=radio][checked]")
[14:34:38] <sethetter> NCS_One: $("input[type=radio]:checked") ** actually
[14:34:49] <JessC> @sethetter beat me to it!
[14:35:03] <sethetter> JessC: :)
[14:35:06] <kontoo> NCS_One: to lift the busy JessC a bit up, have a look here: http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[14:35:13] <DyeA> BillCriswell: yeah me as well, constant stream of great stuff that I can't find again :/  sigh
[14:35:32] <BillCriswell> If only browsers had some way to bookmark these things.
[14:35:35] <DyeA> BillCriswell: guess i need to get hardcore with a snippets prog and start saving stuff
[14:36:03] <DyeA> BillCriswell: lol yeah, well inevitably i search for the wrong keyword in my history or bookmarks
[14:36:11] <JessC> @NCS_One you might also want to set a context for jquery to search something as generic as "input" will slow it down
[14:36:38] <DyeA> BillCriswell: do people still use those or is it now a Sublime snippets world?
[14:36:56] <BillCriswell> DyeA: I have no idea. I just kind of rely on google to find it for me again.
[14:37:11] <DyeA> BillCriswell: well its failing you Bill, isnlt it
[14:37:20] <DyeA> BillCriswell: :) jk
[14:37:34] <NCS_One> sethetter, kontoo: thanks
[14:37:38] <BillCriswell> Well I need to be able to help google a little bit haha.
[14:37:56] <BillCriswell> http://icomoon.io/app/ This was the last thing I bookmarked. It's awesome.
[14:38:14] <NCS_One> this is also ok? $("#formid :radio[checked])
[14:38:46] <BillCriswell> NCS_One: Try it and see. =)
[14:38:59] <sethetter> BillCriswell: I have seen that, very cool stuff
[14:39:02] <kontoo> NCS_One: you should set the search context to speed stuff up as JessC pointed out
[14:39:19] <DyeA> BillCriswell: what i want my Chrome to do is a google search only on all the pages i have bookmarked, filterable by bookmark folder if desired
[14:39:26] <DyeA> BillCriswell: that would be awesome
[14:39:33] <kontoo> NCS_One: http://24ways.org/2011/your-jquery-now-with-less-suck
[14:39:49] <sethetter> DyeA: That would be very awesome. It would be even more awesome to do an in page search of all open tabs
[14:39:57] <BillCriswell> DyeA: You can search your bookmarks.
[14:40:09] <DyeA> BillCriswell: no, the content on the pages as well
[14:40:17] <BillCriswell> DyeA: Ohhhhh.
[14:40:41] <BillCriswell> That would be snazzy.
[14:40:45] <DyeA> sethetter: you can make custom search engiines. its probably just a Chrome plugin wizard away from updating your CSE with your bookmark pages as you add them
[14:41:06] <DyeA> yeah that icomoon thing is rad, saw that too
[14:42:45] <BillCriswell> I'm out of here. Night all!
[14:42:47] <JessC> you can do the same thing in FF same syntax and all just displays in a different way
[14:43:26] <DyeA> wow check out this for jquery perf: http://dumitruglavan.com/jquery-performance-tips-cheat-sheet/
[14:44:24] <JessC> thanks @DyeA! (Goes to rewrite every piece of code ever worked on)
[14:46:07] <DyeA> JessC: lol i know. i never realized tags were faster than class lookups. I thought the browser maintained a hash table of classes like they do id's
[14:47:26] <sethetter> DyeA: so did i, very interesting. Thanks for that
[14:47:50] <sethetter> DyeA: I'm about to be refactoring a lot of javascript for an application at work, so I'll keep these in mind. It needs every performance boost it can get at this point
[14:48:51] <JessC> @sethetter sharepoint?
[14:54:27] <DJTrey> does anyone have any flexslider experience?
[14:55:05] <tw2113> time to go home
[15:03:01] <joAnne> hi. does anyone knows if is possible to have hyperlinks on this "navigation" slider plugin: SLY ?http://darsa.in/sly/#!horizontal
[15:16:07] <thordurorn> quit
[15:22:57] <veQue> hi was following a tutorial. and the guy is using iframe and it work in his video but not when i do it..
[15:23:08] <veQue> is iframe no longer working?
[15:23:50] <JessC> depends on the error and what you were trying to do
[15:23:52] <systemfault> logic failure...
[15:23:56] <recurse> iframe's work great depending on your need.
[15:24:32] <JessC> were you doing this example locally? if so and you opened the file directly in chrome then you'll get a cross domain error
[15:24:42] <veQue> http://youtu.be/enc-dParMg4 well i was at 5 minutes 11 seconds in this video
[15:24:51] <veQue> i can get a frame to display
[15:24:57] <veQue> but the website is not inside
[15:25:01] <recurse> frame and iframe are not the same
[15:25:04] <veQue> just white shows
[15:25:12] <veQue> sorry
[15:25:17] <recurse> with a frame, you need a frameset
[15:25:19] <veQue> i can get an iframe to display
[15:25:31] <recurse> whats the src="" of your iframe?
[15:25:40] <JessC> did you check the console to see any errors?
[15:25:50] <veQue> src="http://www.google.co.uk"
[15:25:54] <recurse> no
[15:25:56] <recurse> Google
[15:25:59] <recurse> stops iframing
[15:26:02] <recurse> try another domain
[15:26:08] <veQue> i tried a few
[15:26:13] <veQue> yahoo.com red.com
[15:26:13] <recurse> no you didnt
[15:26:19] <veQue> yes. i did
[15:26:23] <JessC>  sounds like cross domain policy
[15:26:41] <recurse> an iframe wont give him a cross domain policy if hes simply trying to display it
[15:26:46] <recurse> unless the domain prevent this
[15:27:26] <systemfault> A lot of domains don't allow iframe'ing
[15:27:32] <systemfault> google and facebook are examples.
[15:27:40] <veQue> oh
[15:27:55] <veQue> well i just want to make sure i'm doing the steps right
[15:28:09] <veQue> but every site i try i get no success
[15:28:39] <JessC> in that video example
[15:28:53] <veQue> gonna try http://m.facebook.com/
[15:28:56] <JessC> if you are trying to check the load of the iframe and its a different domain javascript gets an error, for security reasons
[15:29:00] <veQue> from stack overflow
[15:29:19] <JessC> so you aren't doing anything wrong you just need your script to be on the same domain as the one on the iframe
[15:29:43] <recurse> i think he's simply trying to get the bsic mechanics of his iframe to work
[15:29:49] <recurse> no cross domain issues there
[15:30:00] <recurse> yea def try a domain you know is accessible via an iframe
[15:30:07] <recurse> or rather doesnt prevent the framing
[15:30:34] <JessC> at the point of the video they're talking about using .load to capture the loading of an iframe, which would lead me to believe he's getting that error
[15:31:06] <veQue> ok i'll look a bit, then i'll just assume i'm doing it right if no luck
[15:31:40] <JessC> could always create a local html file and set that as the iframe source
[15:31:51] <JessC> that would rule out an issue with domains doing something
[15:32:02] <recurse> oh
[15:32:07] <veQue> k good point
[15:32:10] <recurse> load() surely wont feed him an external domain
[15:32:27] <JessC> unless the domain has CORS
[15:32:31] <JessC> uses CORS*
[15:32:32] <recurse> i just thought it was a simple src="" on iframe issue
[15:33:04] <spobat> hey
[15:33:09] <spobat> am I doing something wrong here?
[15:33:09] <spobat> $("#sliderFrame").style.background = "url(../images/shattered_dark.png)";
[15:33:21] <JessC> yes
[15:33:33] <spobat> okay
[15:33:41] <spobat> it's .css(x,y) i just see :/
[15:33:51] <JessC> $('#sliderFrame').css("background-image", "url('/url/')");
[15:33:55] <systemfault> Use DOM or jQuery... pick one :P
[15:34:00] <Caelum> if I want to select an <li> somewhere below a <div> of class 'drop-nav' is this the right selector: $('.drop-nav li')
[15:34:17] <spobat> sorry
[15:34:18] <spobat> yep
[15:34:57] <systemfault> Caelum: Looks good
[15:36:11] <Caelum> systemfault: thanks!
[15:36:29] <veQue> gonna try to load code to jsfiddle
[15:38:23] <joAnne> does anyone know if is possible to have hyperlinks on this "navigation" slider plugin: SLY ? http://darsa.in/sly/#!horizontal
[15:39:01] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/GHe29/ can someone tell me if i'm missing something blantantly obvious ? and btw i dont know how to use jquery on jsfiddle apparently
[15:39:50] <veQue> how do i point to a file js/ext/js if i'm using jsfiddle?
[15:40:08] <systemfault> veQue http://jsfiddle.net/GHe29/1/
[15:40:19] <JessC> @joAnne I'm sure its possible but you'd have to modify the code
[15:40:22] <systemfault> You need to write: http:// in from of links
[15:40:27] <systemfault> veQue ^
[15:40:37] <veQue> hmm
[15:40:38] <systemfault> s/from/front
[15:40:46] <veQue> let me try that. i thought i did
[15:40:49] <micronix> Does anyone know if in jquery mobile in a collapsible you can set some items to not be collapsables?
[15:41:40] <joAnne> JessC: thanks. If you are familiar with that plugin could you please give me a hint or a small example. I appreciate it
[15:42:19] <katsh> so quick question here. js works in firefox, but not in chrome. nothign in firebug
[15:42:20] <recurse> micronix: in my experience, most of these libraries suck for anything more then tapping transitions
[15:42:23] <katsh> what's the next step in debuging
[15:42:24] <recurse> on mobile
[15:42:26] <Caelum> how do I make a click handler that invokes the CSS :hover behavior on an element
[15:42:39] <recurse> due to interception of Native swipe and tap functionality on devices
[15:42:48] <Caelum> I tried .hover() but I think that's just to bind an event
[15:42:50] <recurse> mostly swipe and drag
[15:42:58] <systemfault> katsh: Look at the chrome dev tools?
[15:43:01] <micronix> recurse: do you recommend another library?
[15:43:19] <systemfault> Caelum: impossible, you need to add/remove a class
[15:43:21] <recurse> no i recommend you keeping the mobile interactions as light as possible
[15:43:27] <katsh> systemfault: you mean the js console?
[15:43:31] <systemfault> katsh: Yes.
[15:43:35] <JessC> @joAnne No I'm familiar with that plugin, it just depends on your js experience level and what modifications you want to make, and how well the plugin was written in the first place
[15:43:45] <recurse> consider it being mobile ... mobile means bandwidth limitatons ... no sense loading in 100kb libs
[15:44:05] <recurse> and limitations on interactions
[15:44:08] <katsh> systemfault: dont see anything there either
[15:44:20] <joAnne> JessC, thanks
[15:44:29] <katsh> here's the weird part, ready? it works on my localhost
[15:44:51] <recurse> you may want to consider accessing the native functions of your target browser and then auto detecting browser type and loading in said functions
[15:45:20] <veQue> systemfault:  ok it works now thanks a lot
[15:45:20] <recurse> but these are really limited at the moment (access to native functionality in mobile browsers)
[15:45:24] <systemfault> katsh: Thatâ€™s a weird bug..
[15:45:34] <katsh> yes. it's here http://crobs.kat.sh
[15:45:52] <katsh> for isntance, not even the menu links on top which just shows() a div, seems to work
[15:45:57] <veQue> s/from/front is that how to load external files?
[15:46:02] <katsh> but on my localhost, it does
[15:46:19] <veQue> on jsfiddle?
[15:46:49] <systemfault> veQue: it means substitute â€œfromâ€ with â€œfrontâ€ on the text I wrote just before...
[15:47:16] <systemfault> katsh: What is the missing functionality? Donâ€™t expect me to know :(
[15:47:25] <veQue> oh i see
[15:47:36] <katsh> systemfault: when you click any of the two links on top, do you see anything?
[15:47:57] <systemfault> katsh: Yeah, same on firefox and chrome
[15:48:01] <veQue> oh cool thanks for the help, hate to be a bother. and btw i see the add resoucres link in jsfiddle
[15:48:02] <katsh> wut
[15:48:14] <katsh> ok type "jquery" in the search box. does it show you some results?
[15:48:27] <katsh> must be a linux chromium bug then
[15:48:36] <systemfault> katsh: Yes, I got the same thing on firefox and chrome
[15:48:43] <katsh> systemfault: thank you
[15:48:49] <katsh> no idea how to debug this
[15:48:59] <katsh> just gonna leave it broken :D
[15:49:21] <systemfault> katsh: chrome 23, windows here...
[15:49:27] <systemfault> (unfortunately..)
[15:49:39] <katsh> systemfault: but it's weird because it works when i run it from localhost.
[15:49:44] <katsh> so im not sure if it's chrome or what.
[15:57:29] <spobat> one more
[15:57:34] <spobat> this should be all okay, right?
[15:57:34] <spobat> $('.presentationBox > a:active, .presentationBox > a:focus').css('background', '#f0f');
[15:58:11] <sethetter> spobat: I don't see any issues there
[15:59:13] <spobat> it seems  not to work on hover :D
[16:01:12] <sethetter> spobat: Well you're targeting active and focus there, not hover.
[16:01:30] <sethetter> spobat: active is for while the link is being clicked, focus is if it has keyboard focus
[16:01:41] <spobat> well, this also doesn't work
[16:01:45] <spobat> $('.presentationBox > a:hover').css('background-image', 'url(images/shattered_dark.png)');
[16:01:56] <JessC> it only will match once
[16:02:13] <spobat> JessC oh?! what could I do? :)
[16:02:16] <JessC> so unless someone is hovering over the link at the time the script is run it won't match anything
[16:02:40] <Caelum> is it possible to disable the hover event when you're in a click event?
[16:02:48] <JessC> $(".presentationBox > a").on("mouseover", â€¦.
[16:02:56] <spobat> aaah! of course
[16:03:10] <spobat> JessC but is it really the same?
[16:03:13] <JessC> @Caelum event.preventDefault()
[16:03:15] <spobat> I want to modify the css property
[16:03:23] <spobat> I don't want to add any event listeners
[16:03:27] <JessC> yes that will
[16:03:55] <JessC> change the property to whatever you set it to, you will need to do a subsequent mouseout event otherwise it will stay that way when the mouse leaves the link
[16:04:33] <JessC> a:* won't match anything unless the user is hovering or whatever at the moment the script traverses the dom
[16:04:38] <JessC> no match = no css change
[16:05:11] <spobat> okay
[16:05:23] <spobat> can you please give an example of this?
[16:05:26] <JessC> have you tried the native css hover?
[16:05:41] <spobat> JessC what do you mean?
[16:05:50] <JessC> give me a seconnd
[16:05:50] <spobat> I just tried: $('.presentationBox > a:hover').css('background-image', 'url(images/shattered_dark.png)');
[16:06:01] <spobat> you can test that yourself, btw: www.troubi.com
[16:06:17] <spobat> if you use google chrome's live console it could do imo
[16:09:36] <spobat_> sorry for the disconnect
[16:10:19] <JessC> @spobat_ http://jsfiddle.net/5JQsL/
[16:10:23] <spobat_> ok got it working :D
[16:10:24] <spobat_> $('.presentationBox > a').hover(function() {
[16:10:24] <spobat_> 			   $(this).css('background', '#252525');
[16:10:24] <spobat_> 			}, function() {
[16:10:24] <spobat_> 			   $(this).css('background', '#f0f');
[16:10:24] <spobat_> 			});
[16:11:08] <TelFiRE> Hey. Is there an established way to use hoverintent in a way that will allow me to expand something when I hover over one element, and then if I move out of the original, and over the expanded element it stays out but still closes if I mouse out of the area of both?
[16:11:35] <JessC> @spobat_ if you are just doing that you should use CSS, see the second example in my fiddle
[16:11:35] <b-ot> JessC, no YOU ARE just doing that you should use CSS, see the second example in my fiddle
[16:12:41] <spobat_> JessC it stays white after moving the mouse out
[16:13:09] <spobat_> i got to go, sorry :(
[16:17:38] <Caelum> I changed all my css from foo:hover to foo:hover, foo.hover then I added a .click event to addClass('hover'), but now I need to figure out how to remove the class when you hover over another element in the menu
[16:20:22] <recurse> Caelum: removeClass
[16:21:07] <recurse> $("#yourElement").mouseover(function () {
[16:21:55] <recurse> 	if($('#someElement').hasClass('someactiveClass')) {	
[16:22:29] <recurse> 	$("#ElementYouwannaRemoveClassFrom").removeClass("whateverClassyouWantRmoved");
[16:22:59] <recurse> follow?
[16:23:02] <recurse> Caelum: ?
[16:23:41] <Caelum> recurse: yeah thanks
[16:23:50] <Caelum> recurse: I got it working, this is the code I used: https://gist.github.com/4122234
[16:24:35] <recurse> cool =)\
[16:27:39] <Caelum> jquery is like, one of the most powerful and awesome things I've ever used
[16:28:06] <tw2113> it's like it can manipulate your dom
[16:52:03] <hadronzoo> I'm trying to set a hidden field value from a form's submit() handler, but the new form values are not being POSTed to the server. Is it appropriate to change hidden fields from a submit() handler?
[16:53:44] <danheberden> i think in the event of a post, the form has already been serialized by the browser
[16:54:02] <danheberden> but i would verify that your form value is indeed changing
[16:54:38] <hadronzoo> danheberden: That makes sense. If I cancel the submit by returning false, the values are changed correctly. Is there a beforeSubmit() handler?
[16:57:34] <recurse> you could do it on mousedown before the click is completed
[16:57:35] <danheberden> hadronzoo: no, it'd be better to change the value and re-submit
[16:57:55] <danheberden> and keep track of the fact that you just changed something and actually want to submit
[16:58:10] <danheberden> the difficulty with using mousedown before the click is it won't get things like pressing enter in a text box
[16:59:17] <hadronzoo> danheberden: so call $('#someForm').submit() from the form's submit handler, setting and checking a flag to make sure it doesn't loop forever?
[16:59:57] <hadronzoo> right, I wanted to make sure the submit handler is called when enter is pressed on the form
[17:00:17] <danheberden>  (function(){ var submit = false; $('form').on('submit', function() { if ( submit ) { return true; } /* do shit */ submit = true; $(this).trigger('submit'); }); }());
[17:00:19] <danheberden> something like that
[17:00:23] <danheberden> but, you know, clean 'n pretty
[17:00:25] <danheberden> and well written
[17:00:28] <danheberden> and awesome
[17:00:49] <hadronzoo> danheberden: I think I can do that. Thanks!
[17:09:05] <bullicon> I don't understand this statement
[17:09:06] <bullicon> $($links.filter('[href="'+location.hash+'"]')[0] || $links[0]);
[17:09:33] <bullicon> does $( â€¦. ) with || between two objects cast it?
[17:12:17] <exit2> Hello, I'm trying to find a jquery slideshow similar to the our homes section on this site http://www.windstarhomes.com/  any advice?
[17:13:43] <acidjazz> how do i run a variable as a function
[17:13:46] <acidjazz> like var init =
[17:13:51] <acidjazz> like var init = 'bob.i';
[17:13:57] <acidjazz> eval(init)(); ?
[17:14:58] <Less_Seen> var my_function = function(blah){return 'something: '+blah;}
[17:15:37] <Less_Seen> alert(my_function('awesome!'));
[17:16:09] <bullicon> what does this || operator mean in js>
[17:16:10] <bullicon> ?
[17:16:15] <Less_Seen> or
[17:16:35] <Less_Seen> var x = somevar || 'default var';
[17:17:03] <bullicon> Less_Seen is somevar is en empty array x is assigned to it right ?
[17:17:13] <Less_Seen> if (true || false) alert('win!');
[17:17:14] <bullicon> cos an empty array I believe is true in js
[17:17:17] <ansdev1> hello!  on this page, we have drag from left list to right list... when you drag over but then back again, the helper clone freezes on the page
[17:17:18] <ansdev1> http://dev.newsserv.com.au/issue-article-test/
[17:17:23] <ansdev1> any help much loved
[17:19:00] <bullicon> Less_Seen thanks
[17:19:19] <Less_Seen> np :)
[17:19:52] <bullicon> Less_Seen: accessing a nonexistent array index does not throw up exception in js
[17:20:12] <bullicon> so [][0] == undefined
[17:20:13] <bullicon> wow
[17:20:49] <Less_Seen> right that was just a quick and dirty way to set a default
[17:21:20] <ansdev1> can anyone have a look at this page for me? http://dev.newsserv.com.au/issue-article-test/
[17:21:36] <ansdev1> i'm seriously stumped
[17:22:42] <bullicon> Less_Seen: wrapping anything in $() returns a selector object?
[17:23:20] <mrs1ck> Evening folks. I'd like to know how I can scan Q/R codes in an app developed using jQuery & jQuery Mobile. Anyone have an idea as to how I might go about embedding a reader into a webpage and scanning a barcode?
[17:23:35] <Caelum> hadronzoo: I use .ajaxSubmit from the form plugin
[17:26:53] <Less_Seen> ansdev1: if you can make a simplified jsfiddle, sometimes that process helps you discover what is wrong.  it is also much easier for people to help
[17:27:05] <hadronzoo> Caelum: Thanks, I'll check that out if I can't get this working
[17:27:39] <ansdev1> Less_Seen: i've just put this page together to simplify the whole process
[17:27:58] <ansdev1> i wouldn't know how to produce a jsfiddle with all the libraries i'm using
[17:28:12] <Less_Seen> its pretty simple
[17:28:15] <Less_Seen> but ok
[17:28:29] <Less_Seen> you can "add resources" to include stuff
[17:28:59] <ansdev1> can you at least see the problem i'm having?
[17:29:00] <mrs1ck> How can I embed a barcode scanner into an app developed using jquery and jquery mobile? Any plugins?
[17:29:21] <ansdev1> i'll put a jsfiddle together over the next hour for sure
[17:29:47] <Less_Seen> ok, just mentioning because it makes it convenient for people to help you
[17:30:09] <Less_Seen> interactive interface etc
[17:30:14] <ansdev1> for sure, i completely agree
[17:32:13] <Less_Seen> i have a few minutes left, so i will take a look - what is the exact problem
[17:32:44] <Less_Seen> i can't really tell what the interface is supposed to accomplish
[17:32:52] <ansdev1> Less_Seen: if you drag the items from the left to the right... that's fine
[17:32:59] <Less_Seen> i see that
[17:33:11] <ansdev1> but when you drag over the right, and then move out again... the clone object freezes on the page
[17:33:16] <ansdev1> i can't find an event for this
[17:33:31] <Less_Seen> ahh i see
[17:33:50] <ansdev1> it snaps back if you click it's original object
[17:33:55] <Less_Seen> heh >_<
[17:34:01] <Less_Seen> thats a crappy one :)
[17:34:03] <ansdev1> but also you can duplicate the clone objects too
[17:34:06] <ansdev1> YEP!
[17:34:49] <hadronzoo> danheberden: Your method worked. Thank you.
[17:34:52] <ansdev1> setting up a jsfiddle with modernizrs yepnope loading things and jquery.tmpl seems like a big fiddle too! :P
[17:35:30] <rmurphey> ansdev1: the idea is thatyou'd eliminate as much of that noise as possible
[17:35:34] <rmurphey> in setting up a fiddle
[17:35:38] <rmurphey> just reduce the problem to its most basic
[17:35:50] <rmurphey> no modernizr, no yepnope, no .tmpl
[17:36:06] <tw2113> evening rmurphey
[17:36:08] <coldhead> no wife, no horse, no mustache
[17:36:19] <Less_Seen> lmao
[17:36:20] <rmurphey> what would you know coldhead
[17:36:23] <rmurphey> you haven't even used jquery
[17:36:25] <tw2113> congrats on the good news the other day rebecca
[17:36:28] <rmurphey> except today
[17:36:39] <ansdev1> but these scripts are a part of the script... i try to keep the test as similar to the dev environment as possible
[17:36:42] <coldhead> i don't know much but i knows what  i like
[17:36:53] <rmurphey> ansdev1: for the sake of a fiddle, get rid of them
[17:36:55] <tw2113> coldhead just likes the $
[17:37:03] <tw2113> it's all about the $
[17:37:13] <ansdev1> rmurphey: that'd kinda mean rebuilding it o_O
[17:37:14] <Less_Seen> the idea is, you narrow it down
[17:37:25] <ansdev1> yeh i've cut out everything not being used
[17:37:30] <Less_Seen> no, just rip the guts out of that part
[17:37:32] <ansdev1> but i'll keep going
[17:37:36] <rmurphey> just make a fiddle
[17:37:39] <rmurphey> that has some stuff on the left
[17:37:43] <rmurphey> and some stuff on the right
[17:37:46] <Less_Seen> add them back one at the time if it works
[17:37:48] <rmurphey> and whatever calls to ui you need
[17:37:53] <rmurphey> to enable the dragging
[17:38:12] <rmurphey> if that works fine, start adding other stuff til it breaks
[17:38:18] <rmurphey> and then you'll find your answer :)
[17:38:28] <aaairc> is it possible to use jquery to programmatically click anywhere in an iframe?
[17:38:31] <Less_Seen> process of elimination :D!
[17:38:52] <Less_Seen> aaairc: yes
[17:38:55] <tw2113> i wish iframes weren't used so damn much
[17:39:04] <rmurphey> also thank you tw2113
[17:39:05] <Less_Seen> .me will not ask why
[17:39:19] <Less_Seen> haha ok that was the last fail of the day for me :P
[17:39:25] <aaairc> Less_Seen: could you point me to a guide?
[17:39:33] <Less_Seen> jquery.com
[17:40:04] <wachpwnski> what does Unexpected token function mean?
[17:40:06] <teleject> via jquery, trying to assign margin-left to an image. It only takes with a force refreshâ€¦ when I reload, the value doesn't get assigned
[17:40:23] * Less_Seen waves ~
[17:40:41] <teleject> not sure if there's a sure fire way to get the value to stick each time
[17:40:57] <rmurphey> wachpwnski: can you show the code that's generating the error and the exact error?
[17:41:50] <rmurphey> teleject: not clear what you're saying, but css assigned with jquery won't persist across reloads
[17:41:52] <wachpwnski> sure one second
[17:42:16] <aaairc> Less_Seen:  is it just $('iframe').click();  ?
[17:42:20] <teleject> ah.
[17:42:33] <rmurphey> teleject: it just alters the style attribute of the element
[17:42:38] <teleject> right.
[17:43:15] <wachpwnski> https://gist.github.com/47f0b0a53b832977b1d6
[17:44:04] <teleject> was going to share the jsfiddle, but it operates flawlessly there
[17:44:07] <MiracleBlue> ericelliott_: You there man?
[17:44:07] <teleject> oh well
[17:44:13] <rmurphey> wachpwnski: what's the exact error?
[17:44:19] <teleject> thanks, rmurphey
[17:44:26] <rmurphey> you may want to lint your code, you have some extra commas on line 22, 26
[17:44:28] <dblosevn> grr what cant i ident lol, everywhere else i am with comcast i can be reverse resolved ... not here though :-(
[17:44:30] <wachpwnski> it is saying this line: function drawHistoricRep(canvas, jsonData) {
[17:44:39] <wachpwnski> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token function
[17:45:07] <rmurphey> wachpwnski: http://www.jshint.com/
[17:45:31] <ansdev1> http://jsfiddle.net/AC7MK/2/    i can't even get it working at all on jsfiddle
[17:45:37] <rmurphey> wachpwnski: lint your code, you'll find the error :)
[17:45:55] <ansdev1> syntax error but no idea where it is!   all i've done is copy out the 'working' script
[17:46:07] <rmurphey> wachpwnski: there are jshint or jslint plugins for pretty much every editor
[17:46:22] <rmurphey> highly recommend using them, but you can also just paste your code into jshint.com and it will tell you what's broken
[17:46:26] <wachpwnski> lol
[17:46:28] <wachpwnski> i see it
[17:59:26] <ansdev1> ok rmurphey, Less_Seen, and anyone else whose super helpful, i've made this fiddle as beautiful as possible but it won't even recognize $.sortable() as a function
[17:59:28] <ansdev1> http://jsfiddle.net/AC7MK/5/
[17:59:47] <tinkster> Trying to use jQuery.validity to validate some form data.  Works well for input type=text; banging my head as to how to make sure that at least one item from a multi-select box has been chosen.
[18:04:38] <tinkster> http://pastebin.com/eEchqGni
[18:04:40] <rmurphey> ansdev1: not sure why it's not loading jquery ui
[18:04:49] <rmurphey> but if you add <script src="http://dev.newsserv.com.au/issue-article-test/js/libs/jquery-ui.min.js?v=2"></script> to the beginning of your html it seems to work
[18:05:24] <rmurphey> or at least, you don't get the error
[18:07:34] <aaairc> does anyone know how to use jquery to trigger a click that will get an embedded iframe youtube video to start playing?
[18:07:38] <aaairc> i tried doing it in this example
[18:07:39] <aaairc> http://jsfiddle.net/h9Dbm/
[18:08:18] <ansdev1> rmurphey: i've fixed that already, it was the dynamic url i was using to load jquery ui
[18:08:34] <ansdev1> but it still doesn't behave correctly... it's finding bugs in the ui
[18:08:49] <ansdev1> jumping instead of dragging
[18:11:07] <aaairc> that may be a bad solution, but the issue is that the embedded video might be youtube, vimeo, aol video, and potentially others... so i thought triggering a click would be the most full proof way
[18:18:51] <tw2113> ?one @ tw2113

[18:30:18] <tina> hello, i need some jquery help. here is a codepen of what i'm working on: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xcasbÂ 
[18:30:18] <tina> the brown span at the top has an updating price depending on which option is selected in the select box, boxes ticked off and radio button selected. when the items are checked the price refreshes. unfortunately, when the select box is checked, the prices do not refresh. they only refresh once a checkbox or radio is selected. would someone be able to look at my code and tell me where i went wrong? thanks so much :)
[18:30:58] <danheberden> tina, you can't do a click event on selects
[18:31:09] <danheberden> browsers don't use it reliably (or some at all)
[18:31:13] <danheberden> use the change event for those
[18:31:48] <danheberden> change should work for those checkboxes too
[18:31:56] <danheberden> try it out
[18:34:27] <tina> SWEET @ danheberden you're awesome. thanks :D i'm new to writing my own scripts in jquery. thanks for your help.
[18:38:19] <danheberden> tina - just remember you're writing javascript
[18:38:32] <danheberden> you're just using jQuery :)
[18:39:01] <tina> yeah whatever you call itâ€¦ i'm new to all of it so i don't know what to call what i'm doing yet ;) lol but thanks.
[18:39:12] <tina> so what do you call that? "writing lines of jquery"?
[18:41:20] <coldhead> writing Javascript that uses jQuery
[18:41:39] <coldhead> you speak english even if you use a post-apocalyptic jargon
[18:45:24] <tina> ok cool. not sure what that last part meant though.
[18:45:33] <danheberden> he's new
[18:46:35] <coldhead> you speak english even if you use a legal or medical jargon
[18:46:43] <coldhead> sorry, that's what i meant to say
[18:46:47] <coldhead> thought i was in ##theology
[18:47:43] <danheberden> coldhead, you make me simile
[18:49:28] <coldhead> sew dew ewe
[18:50:52] <mike31> hi
[18:53:34] <mike31> I am having trouble getting an ajax request to use browser caching rules I set in the header in php. I changed the ajax method to GET since I though it would have a better chance of doing what I wanted. It didn't do it... I think. I still see "response 200" in the js console, however I do not see anything in the net panel, so I'm not even really sure its not working
[18:53:54] <mike31> hang on just though of a test. Any tips would help though
[18:57:25] <mike31> oh. it was working. jesus its hard to know if browser cache is working
[19:11:02] <tina> i had another question. i wanted to simplify my form for users (which complicates it for me). here's the codepen again. http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xcasb
[19:11:02] <tina> i want users to put a number in the quantity field and have that number multiply by its class and add that to the total. also, is there a better way to store the number other than in a class/id?
[19:12:12] <tw2113> data attribute would be a good way
[19:13:31] <tina> thank you tw2113
[19:15:24] <tina> so i've updated the code pen to say data-price. any idea how to make the rest of it work? :)
[19:16:45] <tw2113> haven't been paying attention
[19:19:24] <tina> in the codepen http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xcasb you can see what i'm trying to do. when a user selects a checkbox or radio, the price is updated. i was previously using selects with price values which means i have to type them all out. i want to be able to multiply the quantity value by the data-price attribute. e.g. 1 x 300 = 300, 2x300 = 600, etc. and i want that to reflect the price and play nice with everything else.
[19:34:44] <tina> can anyone help?
[19:35:07] <BillCriswell> tina: What's the issue?
[19:35:29] <tina> in the codepen http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xcasb you can see what i'm trying to do. when a user selects a checkbox or radio, the price is updated. i was previously using selects with price values which means i have to type them all out. i want to be able to multiply the quantity value by the data-price attribute. e.g. 1 x 300 = 300, 2x300 = 600, etc. and i want that to reflect the price and play nice with everything else.
[19:44:05] <tina> i added more code BillCriswell http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xcasb â€¦ also did you see my above post?
[19:47:04] <tina> i want to multiply the value by the data-price and have it update in the price
[19:49:25] <BillCriswell> tina: You would just attach attach a change event to the inputs and run through all the fields and handle the math.
[20:35:35] <tachoknight> hi everyone. i'm new to jquery and something has me stumped. I'm trying to pass a json object to my spring mvc service, but no matter what i do to set the content type to json, the service sees it as application/x-www-form-urlencoded
[20:35:53] <tachoknight> I set contentType to application/json, but the service doesn't see it
[20:36:12] <tachoknight> i used Poster in Firefox, set it to application/json and it works with the service just fine
[20:39:51] <tachoknight> it seems right to me: $.ajax({type: "POST", contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",url : $form.attr('action'),data: '{"partyName":"bobo"}',dataType: "json"});
[20:40:24] <tachoknight> but like i said, spring sees it as the query default form type, not json
[20:41:32] <tw2113> i ove breaking the production copy of my site
[20:42:00] <tw2113> love*
[20:42:12] <tachoknight> firebug sees the headers as application/x-www-form-urlencoded as well, so it matches what spring sees
[20:42:45] <tachoknight> latest version of jquery too; just downloaded it from the site
[20:45:39] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> how do I select an item in a dropbox (html select) with jquery?
[20:46:42] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> let's say I wanna select Female in a select input that has both genders
[20:47:59] <Kitu> $(this).html()
[20:48:20] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> Kitu: is that for me?
[20:48:25] <Kitu> yes
[20:48:52] <coldhead> NICOLAS_Leonidas: enjoy!
[20:49:08] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> how is that gonna help me it returns the options
[20:49:36] <Kitu> it's not that you want ?
[20:49:36] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> http://jsfiddle.net/5THJr/
[20:49:46] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> I just need to select female in this
[20:50:03] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> no, I think the fact that html select is called select is confusing lol I failed googling it
[20:50:24] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> I googled how do you select in select jquery lol
[20:51:16] <coldhead> $('select').val('Female')
[20:52:07] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> coldhead: didn't work
[20:52:21] <coldhead> i was guessing
[20:52:25] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[20:52:33] <coldhead> i am going to try a demo on jsfiddle
[20:52:54] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> coldhead: that figures, welcome to jQuery land
[20:53:59] <coldhead> it works for me here http://jsfiddle.net/jXd52/
[20:54:48] <lahwran> hi folks
[20:55:22] <lahwran> is there any prebaked way to go from a .css("margin-right") value to an integer in pixels?
[20:55:32] <lahwran> say, parse_css() or something
[20:56:01] <lahwran> or alternately, is there any way to do .height() and .width() such that they include margin/border/padding?
[20:56:19] <coldhead> NICOLAS_Leonidas: http://jsfiddle.net/jXd52/1/
[20:56:37] <coldhead> that has an alternate method to select via the text in the menu, rather than the value, if that's your issue
[20:56:41] <lahwran> oh, outerWidth
[20:56:47] <lahwran> I was barking up the wrong tree
[20:57:19] <MiracleBlue> Hey guys!
[20:57:24] <lahwran> Hi person!
[20:57:28] <MiracleBlue> :D
[20:57:31] <MiracleBlue> Sup?
[20:58:27] <lahwran> MiracleBlue: just trying to get a reliable way to calculate the desired height of this thing based on the content
[20:58:41] <lahwran> it's a pain, css/js isn't designed to do this
[20:58:50] <MiracleBlue> lahwran: The desired height?  Or the actual height of content?
[20:59:10] <lahwran> MiracleBlue: as in, I need to figure out how tall I should make an OS window in order to have enough room for the content
[20:59:29] <lahwran> except I want some of it to be dynamic and some static so I have to make everything play along
[20:59:54] <MiracleBlue> So you want to know the computed height of your content, and adjust the window to fit?
[21:00:25] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> coldhead: yup works, thank you
[21:00:55] <coldhead> lahwran: can't you just get the height of a container which is height:auto?
[21:00:59] <coldhead> around it?
[21:01:13] <MiracleBlue> Or you could wrap a span around all your content and get the computed height of that span
[21:01:23] <coldhead> like i said! samies!
[21:01:30] <MiracleBlue> :D
[21:02:03] <lahwran> coldhead: nope, because I want to have a maximum height which changes with the height of the screen
[21:02:15] <lahwran> but I want to apply that maximum height to something inside the window
[21:02:20] <lahwran> not body
[21:02:44] <coldhead> oh that sounds awful
[21:02:48] <lahwran> :D
[21:03:04] <MiracleBlue> Interesting.
[21:03:15] <lahwran> so I have to calculate the total height of the things around it, subtract those from the max, and set the result as the maximum height for the target element
[21:03:30] <lahwran> which means I have to have really accurate height computations for the relevant elements or I'll get wonkies everywhere
[21:03:40] <MiracleBlue> oooh man
[21:03:51] <MiracleBlue> sounds exactly like some of the crazy stuff I had to do for a client the other week
[21:03:58] <lahwran> this is for me
[21:03:59] <MiracleBlue> So much insane positioning math
[21:04:09] <lahwran> so I get to say "nope this isn't fun anymore" if I get to that point
[21:04:23] <lahwran> but eh, I'm the right kind of insane to enjoy this for long enough to get it done
[21:04:27] <MiracleBlue> aT the moment, I'm gnawing on some audio stuff.
[21:05:17] <lahwran> my uncontrollable urge to Do It Right will eventually end me, I'm sure of it
[21:05:24] <MiracleBlue> Argh, yes.
[21:05:29] <MiracleBlue> I know exactly that feeling.
[21:05:52] <MiracleBlue> Perfectionism will be the death of me.
[21:06:19] <lahwran> otherwise I'd just hand calculate it once, and hard code it
[21:06:24] <lahwran> thing is I might at some point share this
[21:06:33] <lahwran> so it feels dirty ...
[21:06:50] <coldhead> lahwran: i bet there is a way to do it in pure CSS
[21:06:55] <coldhead> probably with media queries
[21:06:56] <MiracleBlue> I'm developing a digital audio workstation in native javascript :3
[21:07:17] <coldhead> oh man i'd love to use that, MiracleBlue
[21:07:27] <MiracleBlue> :D
[21:07:35] <coldhead> have you seen http://dashersw.github.com/pedalboard.js/ ?
[21:07:40] <MiracleBlue> coldhead: Yep sure have
[21:07:47] <MiracleBlue> I've seen everything under the sun haha
[21:08:13] <coldhead> oh good, i expect your project to be at least that good then
[21:08:16] <lahwran> coldhead: well what I want is to say "this element takes up all remaining height"
[21:08:20] <MiracleBlue> The one I'm working on is actually a fully featured DAW
[21:08:30] <coldhead> oh that stuff suuucks, lahwran
[21:08:33] <MiracleBlue> Sound design, synthesis, sequencing, arrangement, effects, mixer board, everything
[21:08:44] <coldhead> lahwran: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-equalizebottoms-plugin/
[21:08:45] <b-ot> A chocolate brown Lab, named Checkers.
[21:08:49] <coldhead> you have to use something like that
[21:08:54] <rmill> lol
[21:08:59] <coldhead> fuck me, b-ot
[21:09:31] <lahwran> coldhead: I've been musing on it all day, I think I'm already there, I just need to stop talking and do it
[21:09:43] <MiracleBlue> lahwran: just do it man
[21:09:52] <MiracleBlue> Go go go
[21:10:31] <MiracleBlue> I've gotta stop thinking about this modular midi notation system and build it already
[21:11:18] <lahwran> and then throw it away, and then build it again, and then throw it away, and then take a different approach entirely, and then throw that away and go back to the old approach but improved...
[21:11:33] <coldhead> or just use flash
[21:11:35] <MiracleBlue> I've already done that 4 times with my project :P
[21:11:47] <MiracleBlue> It's on its 4th re-write
[21:11:59] <MiracleBlue> coldhead: You into DAWs?
[21:12:49] <coldhead> i.. don't know what that is
[21:12:50] <coldhead> so maybe?
[21:12:53] <MiracleBlue> Ooh
[21:12:57] <MiracleBlue> DAW = Digital Audio Workstation
[21:12:59] <coldhead> oh right
[21:13:04] <coldhead> uh i like sound
[21:13:07] <MiracleBlue> Sorry, from your response earlier I assumed you were familiar haha
[21:13:17] <coldhead> i haven't found any software i like better than actual hardware yet
[21:13:26] <coldhead> and actual hardware i mean an amplifier with things plugged into it
[21:13:31] <MiracleBlue> Ahh ok :)
[21:13:31] <coldhead> BUT I WELCOME SUCH INNOVATIONS
[21:13:34] <MiracleBlue> I see.
[21:13:41] <coldhead> so don't stop on my account
[21:13:44] <MiracleBlue> I'm an electronic music producer
[21:13:53] <MiracleBlue> Been producing for 12 years now
[21:13:54] <coldhead> oh so you are all about DAWS
[21:13:57] <coldhead> woah
[21:13:59] <MiracleBlue> You betchya :)
[21:14:07] <coldhead> that's the kind of experience a decent audio project needs
[21:14:24] <coldhead> are you on github, MiracleBlue ?
[21:14:28] <MiracleBlue> coldhead: Sure am!
[21:14:35] <lahwran> you mean the kind of experience that LMMS doesn't have?
[21:14:36] <MiracleBlue> http://github.com/miracleblue
[21:14:42] <MiracleBlue> lahwran: Exactly
[21:14:44] <coldhead> ah, JSaw
[21:15:14] <coldhead> i fixed a typo for JSam many years ago
[21:15:43] <coldhead> omg you are doing a sampler in the browser?
[21:15:45] <MiracleBlue> JSam is only new, it was created out of the core of JSaw :)
[21:15:52] <MiracleBlue> I'm doing sampling, synthesis, everything
[21:16:00] <coldhead> what am i thinking of then >: |
[21:16:12] <coldhead> anyway i never used it
[21:16:15] <lahwran> aw vs am
[21:16:16] <coldhead> whatever it was
[21:16:19] <lahwran> nice clear naming
[21:16:40] <MiracleBlue> JSAW = Javascript Audio Workstation
[21:16:54] <MiracleBlue> JSAM = JS Audio Modules
[21:17:20] <coldhead> JSMad
[21:17:23] <coldhead> is what i was thinking of
[21:17:29] <MiracleBlue> Ahhh right :D
[21:17:29] <MiracleBlue> Ok.
[21:17:30] <coldhead> this is getting confusing
[21:18:51] <MiracleBlue> If anyone is interested in helping out, I'm always looking for contributors :D
[21:18:52] <lahwran> whee, here goes
[21:19:03] <MiracleBlue> Audio experience not necessarily required
[21:19:04] * lahwran restarts the cocoa app containing webkit
[21:19:35] <lahwran> that was anticlimactic
[21:19:45] <MiracleBlue> KABOOM!
[21:19:51] <MiracleBlue> Explosions!
[21:19:51] <army> having a hard time loading a jquery based gallery on ajax call
[21:19:55] <MiracleBlue> *directed by michael bay*
[21:20:32] <coldhead> i'm following you on github now MiracleBlue
[21:20:35] <MiracleBlue> :D
[21:20:43] <coldhead> if i see anything to match my competence i will jump in
[21:20:50] <MiracleBlue> thanks man
[21:21:01] <coldhead> i mainly specialise in typos in README.md files
[21:21:05] <MiracleBlue> Hahaha
[21:21:12] <MiracleBlue> Excellent, very valuable skill set
[21:25:54] <MiracleBlue> Yay
[21:25:59] <MiracleBlue> Got a call about a possible job
[21:26:02] <MiracleBlue> Fingers crossed
[21:27:23] <coldhead> good luck with that
[21:27:27] <coldhead> anything interesting?
[21:29:00] <MiracleBlue> coldhead: POssibly
[21:29:02] <MiracleBlue> I'm not sure yet.
[21:29:06] <MiracleBlue> JS focussed.
[21:30:07] <MiracleBlue> Backbone, jquery etc.
[21:30:34] <coldhead> oh good stuff
[21:30:55] <MiracleBlue> Yeah :D
[21:31:39] <MiracleBlue> I hope it's something super fun and interesting.
[21:43:42] <army> how can i get all ids with jquery that start with a certain string?
[21:44:01] <army> i have the corresponding class that would be defined
[21:45:09] <danheberden> army, can you elaborate?
[21:45:19] <army> i'm replacing content through ajax
[21:45:36] <army> if a <div with id="myGallery_X"> is present, I want to initiate the slideshow
[21:45:42] <army> X is variable
[21:45:45] <danheberden> i mean, you *can* do $('*[id^="startswith"]') but ewwwww
[21:45:55] <danheberden> what are you doing that, may i ask?
[21:45:57] <army> the div has the class "galleryview" set as well
[21:46:07] <danheberden> army, what about this
[21:46:07] <army> well some articles have slide show galleries, but most don't
[21:46:14] <danheberden> set X as a data-attr
[21:46:35] <danheberden> <div data-gallery="X" class="galleryview">
[21:46:39] <army> aha!
[21:46:41] <danheberden> then $('.galleryview')
[21:46:46] <danheberden> and then you can .data('gallery')
[21:46:48] <danheberden> to get X
[21:47:02] <army> i can't use $('.galleryview');, the way the galleryview script is written it will generate a stackoverflow if the class is being used
[21:47:19] <danheberden> or $( '.galleryview[data-gallery="1234"]' )
[21:47:19] <army> oh
[21:47:20] <danheberden> whatever
[21:47:37] <army> i understand
[21:53:19] <army> danheberden thanks for your help, actually it seems that a change i made before fixed the stack over flow problem when calling the function with the class
[21:53:30] <army> what happens actually when i call a function on a non-existing class?
[21:53:47] <army> e.g. $jQ('.galleryview').galleryView({ });
[21:53:51] <army> but .galleryview doesn't exist
[21:54:00] <army> should I add a check before that, or does jQ catch that automatically
[22:09:08] <rmill> ?tias @ army
[22:09:10] <bot-t> army, Try It And See
[22:13:11] <rmill> if you NEED to check for the existence of a thing: if( $( '.thing' ).length ) { doStuffWithThing(); }
[22:17:48] <voidpirate> Hi fellow developers
[22:18:15] <MiracleBlue> Herrow
[22:18:16] <MiracleBlue> :D
[22:21:42] <voidpirate> Does anyone have any good recommendations on books for learning JavaScript and jQuery?
[22:22:01] <coldhead> ?g jqfundamentals
[22:22:04] <bot-t> coldhead, jQuery Fundamentals :: A guide to the basics of jQuery - http://jqfundamentals.com/
[22:22:09] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[22:22:10] <bot-t> coldhead, I'm a bot you know..
[22:23:07] <voidpirate> Thanks :-D
[22:33:33] <defaultro_> i would like to put a series of <div> inside a function to make it clean say displayInstructions(); I am not sure how I should write the code. The <div> code only display a box and some text.
[22:34:54] <defaultro_> i tried to put the <div> in an html and then I used $.get. However, the box didn't get displayed
[22:35:53] <coldhead> show us your code
[22:36:00] <defaultro_> one sec
[22:36:17] <tw2113> *slow motion* share?the...code
[22:37:34] <defaultro_> http://jsfiddle.net/33f8e/
[22:37:56] <defaultro_> the code that you will see there is from my html file inside <body></body>. It works
[22:37:57] <spobat> hey
[22:38:16] <defaultro_> however, i need to put that code in a javascript application
[22:38:17] <spobat> How can I undo steps like these?
[22:38:17] <spobat> http://ideone.com/fv4jhT
[22:40:22] <defaultro_> can I do it this way $('#form-road').appendTo('<div>......and so on');
[22:40:33] <tw2113> spobat, so you want to change the background to a dark gray on hover, transparent on non-hover, and #09c when in the middle of a click?
[22:40:47] <spobat> yes
[22:40:54] <coldhead> can you show us the JS, defaultro_? i am struggling to understand what you are trying to do
[22:40:56] <defaultro_> did you see it coldhead?
[22:40:57] <spobat> but how do I eliminate the event listener after?
[22:41:16] <defaultro_> there isn't much js yet
[22:41:25] <defaultro_> it is just displaying the box
[22:41:30] <spobat> tw2113, ^
[22:42:00] <amh345> i feel like im on crazy pills here.  im trying to get some ajax responses functioning. but it's no dice everytime.    when i click this > <a href="/test" class="ttt" data-remote="true">hi</a>   my serverside js >>   console.log($(this).attr('class'));  returns undefined.  every single time.
[22:42:04] <defaultro_> coldhead: what I want to do is display the box using jquery
[22:42:13] <tw2113> not sure on that one, i'll leave it to coldhead
[22:42:28] <spobat> coldhead is a person, ah!
[22:42:30] <spobat> okay
[22:42:33] <spobat> coldhead, ? :D
[22:42:58] <amh345> the console should log, the class name 'ttt', no?
[22:43:28] <tw2113> sorry coldy
[22:45:23] <coldhead> defaultro_: this probably isn't what you're on about but this is how i'd get a bit out of the HTML that's returned and do something with it
[22:45:25] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/33f8e/1/
[22:45:55] <defaultro_> coldhead, this is a working code but in html - http://jsfiddle.net/33f8e/2/
[22:46:00] <defaultro_> checking your code too
[22:46:56] <defaultro_> that is sweet. I am  missing the 2 lines then
[22:47:07] <coldhead> spobat: http://ideone.com/afhyZE ?
[22:47:10] <coldhead> ?one @ spobat
[22:47:11] <defaultro_> This is what I wrote earlier,  $.get("assets/templates/roadinstructions.html", function(r){});
[22:47:11] <bot-t> spobat, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[22:47:29] <defaultro_> coldhead, my function is empty
[22:48:01] <defaultro_> I'll add your code now. Thanks a lot!!!
[22:48:24] <coldhead> amh345: i don't understand, you lost me at "serverside JS"
[22:48:59] <MiracleBlue> I'm seriously considering doing a kickstarter to help fund development of my JSaw project.  I've got no idea whether or not there'd be enough interest for it to work though.
[22:49:01] <MiracleBlue> Hmm.
[22:49:44] <coldhead> more interest if you can get a demo up first, MiracleBlue. cc lighttable or lightdesk or w/e it's called
[22:49:54] <amh345> coldhead: in my view i have <a href="/test" class="ttt" data-remote="true">hi</a>   in my controller i tell it to call the proper js file.   it's not really serverside, but it kind of is.
[22:49:56] <MiracleBlue> Yeah
[22:50:34] <amh345> it's seeming like i cant get anything in respect to attributes on the link im clicking.
[22:50:37] <coldhead> amh345: console.log(this) might help you ensure that this is the right thing?
[22:50:37] <spobat> thank you
[22:51:01] <coldhead> that's what i'd try anyway
[22:51:07] <coldhead> MVCs like to steal this
[22:51:11] <defaultro_> what is #someContainer in the code?
[22:51:13] <coldhead> you have to use this.el or some bollocks
[22:51:23] <coldhead> defaultro_: that's the target in the parent page
[22:51:29] <coldhead> whever you want stuff to go
[22:51:33] <defaultro_> ok
[22:51:55] <defaultro_> I'll have to figure out what the target is then
[22:52:17] <amh345> coldhead: when i log $(this) i get [#document, context: #document]   with tons of information.  looks like it's the entire document
[22:52:57] <amh345> the thing im trying to figure out right now is if it's a problem with my js or a problem with a connection between my serverside not passing the information along
[22:53:09] <amh345> the js is so dead simple. it should work.
[22:55:45] <coldhead> i've just been advised that today is national go home on time day
[22:55:50] <coldhead> so i must go home on time
[22:55:56] <coldhead> best wishes for all your projects
[22:56:34] <lahwran> coldhead / MiracleBlue: I think I made it work
[22:56:38] <lahwran> well then
[22:56:41] <MiracleBlue> Awesome :D
[22:57:14] <lahwran> MiracleBlue: thing is, as is typical with trying to calculate height manually, I seem to be two pixels off in one place, which is causing a phantom scrollbar to appear when not needed
[22:57:25] <lahwran> close enough for now I guess
[22:58:15] <lahwran> I can even tell that it's _exactly_ two pixels
[22:58:46] <MiracleBlue> Ahh interesting
[22:59:00] <MiracleBlue> Try overflow: hidden
[22:59:05] <lahwran> and I stuck a css reset in my stylesheet
[22:59:25] <lahwran> heh, maybe I'll do "if inner > outer -> overflow: hidden"
[22:59:33] <lahwran> haaack
[23:00:26] <lahwran> I really want to know where this is coming from!
[23:00:49] <lahwran> I should stub out my embedding api for testing in chrome, where I have high-tech dev tools to identify problems
[23:00:59] <lahwran> I feel all alone without chrome's dev tools, even though I'm in webkit :p
[23:02:19] <otherj> it's bad that we can get so used to it
[23:02:25] <otherj> i tried to use the new tools in safari and couldn't
[23:02:25] <lahwran> why is that bad?
[23:02:29] <lahwran> oh I see
[23:02:38] <otherj> not good to be dependent on one thing like this probably
[23:02:57] <lahwran> I could have sworn chrome dev tools was isolated such that it could be jammed into other webkits :p
[23:03:09] <otherj> i hope so!
[23:03:26] <lahwran> but I went looking for it to do just that, and found nothing but documentation on using the dev tools
[23:03:29] <lahwran> nothing on ab-using it
[23:03:29] <lahwran> :p
[23:03:43] <geiregjo> Morning
[23:03:47] <lahwran> midnight
[23:03:53] <geiregjo> Not in Belgium :p
[23:04:07] <lahwran> well it's not morning here
[23:04:10] <lahwran> only one of us can be right
[23:04:16] <geiregjo> Good day?
[23:04:22] <lahwran> good evening
[23:04:30] <geiregjo> How about
[23:04:32] <geiregjo> Hey
[23:06:02] <geiregjo> I'm combining jquery mobile with backbone. So my backbone router is calling .changePage to get the pages dancing. The issue that I'm having is that if I navigate to another page, my old navigation is updated. Not the one for the next page.
[23:06:25] <lahwran> geiregjo: I'm just messing with you, don't take it too seriously :)
[23:06:39] <geiregjo> I know ;)
[23:07:02] <lahwran> and, I'm afraid I'm unfamiliar with backbone - a coworker is preparing an angular.js rewrite of our app, though, so we'll see how that goes
[23:07:15] <lahwran> angular looked kinda wonky. in any case I'm unable to be of use
[23:07:15] <geiregjo> The pages are added to the dom in a dynamic way. So everytime I navigate to a page wich is not loaded yet I add it to the dom on the pagebeforechange event.
[23:07:37] <geiregjo> Seems to by a hype with the r&d guys.
[23:08:01] <geiregjo> They've been pushing me to try it, but it will have to wait :)
[23:21:53] <geiregjo> I get the idea that jqm is updating the navbar from my first page
[23:26:44] <defaultro_> I still can't figure it out. Problem is that I don't have anything to attach the div too. The template I loaded is the complete box
[23:27:44] <defaultro_> is it possible to $.get an html file then display it without have to appendTo the value?
[23:30:17] <Cork> defaultro: no
[23:30:40] <defaultro_> Cork, ouch! :(
[23:31:06] <MiracleBlue> You know what's weird
[23:31:20] <MiracleBlue> My feet are too cold, but the rest of me is too warm.
[23:31:20] <defaultro_> how should I display the box if there is nothing on the page?
[23:31:40] <Cork> defaultro: append it to body
[23:31:50] <Cork> there's always a body on the page
[23:31:51] <defaultro_> oh
[23:31:58] <Cork> $(document.body).append()
[23:32:19] <Cork> defaultro: and the html file you fetch should only contain the body part of the html
[23:32:30] <Cork> (else you will get invalid html)
[23:32:46] <defaultro_> like this -> $('body').appendTo(data);
[23:32:57] <Cork> append, not appendTo
[23:33:16] <defaultro_> ok. what's the difference?
[23:33:25] <Cork> ?.appendTo
[23:33:25] <bot-t> .appendTo(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target. http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[23:33:27] <Cork> ?.append
[23:33:27] <bot-t> .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[23:33:48] <defaultro_> sweet
[23:33:55] <defaultro_> thanks  a lot!
[23:34:34] <defaultro_> let me refresh my browser since it's so slow. I'll reconnect here
[23:36:51] <defaultro__> Awesome Cork, it work!!!
[23:36:56] <defaultro__> worked
[23:38:16] <defaultro__> I just need to go down one level since when I added it to the body, the box was a bit high. I'll attach it to canvas instead.
[23:40:00] <defaultro__> Cork, woohoo, $('.canvas').append(data); worked! :D
[23:40:24] <Cork> O_o
[23:40:37] <Cork> whats .canvas?
[23:41:01] <defaultro__> html5 canvas as well as class canvas
[23:41:08] <Cork> uh
[23:41:13] <Cork> you can't append to a canvas
[23:41:30] <defaultro__> <div class="canvas" style="width: 1440px; height: 630px;" width="1440" height="630">
[23:41:31] <Cork> canvas is like appending to an img tag
[23:41:36] <defaultro__> it worked though
[23:41:44] <Cork> ya, but thats not a canvas :)
[23:41:51] <Cork> should prob change that name
[23:41:51] <defaultro__> yeah, under that is
[23:41:59] <defaultro__> <canvas height="630" width="1440" style="margin: 0px;"></canvas>
[23:42:13] <Cork> like i said, canvas can't be appended to
[23:42:15] <defaultro__> that's true, it's a bit confusing for someone who doesn't know
[23:42:45] <defaultro__> thanks for helping me!!! It's a big thing for me :D
[23:42:56] <army> how can i call a jquery function that is defined in another function
[23:43:20] <defaultro__> doing an svn commit now before I lose it,hehehe
[23:43:29] <Cork> army: you can't unless its attached to an object that you can reach
[23:43:51] <army> aha!
[23:44:19] <army> so if onload i run $('#myGallery_4').galleryView({ });
[23:44:26] <defaultro__> Cork. one more. How can I make that box I made draggable?
[23:44:31] <army> i could then reach playpause() which is defined in it by
[23:44:42] <defaultro__> it's just a simple div
[23:44:50] <army> $('#myGallery_4').playpause(); ?
[23:44:53] <Cork> defaultro__: most likely you want jqeury-ui
[23:45:10] <defaultro__> looks like we have that loaded in index.php
[23:45:21] <defaultro__> not sure how to use it though
[23:45:27] <Cork> army: only if galleryView attach playpause to $.fn
[23:45:56] <Cork> army: if its a normal plugin it's most likely galleryView('playpause') though
[23:46:25] <Cork> ?.draggable @ defaultro
[23:46:30] <bot-t> defaultro, UI/API/1.8/Draggable - jQuery Wiki - The jQuery UI Draggable plugin makes selected elements draggable by mouse. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.8/Draggable
[23:46:57] <army> cork the function is defined inside the $.fn http://battleasia.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-nextgen-galleryview/GalleryView/scripts/jquery.galleryview-2.0.js?9d7bd4
[23:48:20] <Cork> army: that function isn't publicly accessible
[23:48:26] <army> ok
[23:48:28] <Cork> its private
[23:48:45] <army> if i would move it out, how could i access the 'paused' parameter? by making it public?
[23:49:01] <army> yeah i'll try that
[23:49:06] <army> thanks
[23:49:47] <Cork> army: you're best option would be to make a public $.fn accessor for that function
[23:50:15] <Cork> army: the problem is it access local variables to the galleryView function
[23:50:41] <Cork> army: so frankly you can't make that work well with a public accessable playpause
[23:51:06] <army> hm
