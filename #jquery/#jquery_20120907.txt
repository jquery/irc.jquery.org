[00:30:52] <jomofcw> Hello !
[00:31:03] <hooloovoo> hello there!
[00:31:06] <jomofcw> Using the form plugin, how could I get the submited data ?
[00:31:08] <jomofcw> please
[00:31:22] <hooloovoo> um? what do you mean?
[00:32:13] <tw2113> php
[00:32:19] <tw2113> :D
[00:32:24] <jomofcw> I have many button type=submit in my form. I would like to know the value of the one which have been click.
[00:32:31] <tw2113> or if you're trying to do something pre-processing
[00:32:40] <jomofcw> yup pre processing
[00:32:49] <tw2113> you'd probably want to grab them onsubmit, with .val()
[00:33:31] <jomofcw> Hm val() isn't the solution because it won't give me the val() of the clicked submit button. Right ?
[00:34:32] <tw2113> you could probably put on click handlers for each submit button
[00:34:35] <tw2113> dunno how many you'd have
[00:34:44] <AdamPDotty> buttons.click(function(){ alert(this.val());}); might work
[00:34:50] <jomofcw> Hm, that's an idea.
[00:35:04] <AdamPDotty> this is exactly the clicked button
[00:35:26] <jomofcw> But the form plugin should get the data before send it to the AJAX... so we probably can get it too.
[00:36:20] <diegoviola> any dropdown menu plugins you guys can recommend?
[00:36:21] <diegoviola> with css3, etc
[00:36:56] <tw2113> css3 dropdowns need jquery plugins?
[00:37:25] <jomofcw> OK I'm dumb, the answer is in the form plugin doc :/ sorry to disturb you
[00:38:41] <tw2113> what disturbance?
[00:38:45] <tw2113> that's the point of this room
[00:38:49] <tw2113> asking jquery help
[00:39:03] <tw2113> it's not a room dedicated to sitting around with our thumbs up our buts
[00:39:05] <tw2113> butts*
[00:39:36] <jomofcw> lol yea you're right tw2113
[00:39:43] <jomofcw> but I should RTFM before ask ;).
[00:41:11] * AdamPDotty takes thumbs off butt
[00:41:29] <tw2113> never a bad idea
[00:41:35] <tw2113> re: manual
[00:41:41] <tw2113> not re: AdamPDotty
[00:43:31] <Christer_> Hi all, Do you know how i can make some content(web-page) that normally would have a resolution like 1080 x 1600 fit into a popup and be available in that size with a scrollbar ?
[00:44:21] <AdamPDotty> sound like CSS ?!
[00:49:55] <ronino> hello
[00:50:23] <kurrataW> join #regexp
[00:50:50] <AdamPDotty> ok
[00:51:12] <ronino> I have two forms which should visibly be nested on the page, but cannot be in the markup (as it's not allowed), the question is whether I can put them next to each other in the markup and have them appear nested, I'm thinking about some placeholder element where the inside form is automatically moved by jQuery, is there something like that?
[00:53:49] <sjeijk> good morning
[01:21:32] <ravenzz> so
[01:21:37] <Christer_> Does anyone know why IE wont run the onload command and change the body height and width with jQuery ?
[01:22:17] <ravenzz> the more I use jQuery UI/Mobile the more i think its lame :P at least the markup, will the new version rewrite from scratch?
[01:22:46] <ravenzz> +be
[01:24:20] <Trudko> is $(window).load run at same time asi window.onLoad ??
[01:25:02] <g33k> I have a div  (div A ) and some input fields within that div. So its basically a form. Within that form (div) there another smaller form (div B). Now I want to dynamically replicate forms A and B (div A & div ).SO there can be multiple 'A' divs and multiple 'B' divs within each 'A' div.  I'm using this in the view side of a Rails 3 app. Can anyone suggest me a way to do this using jquery ?
[01:26:43] <Jee5us_w> Hi! I have a tiny question. How do I clear a css property? I tried $('html').css('overflow-y',''); but it's still on scroll.
[01:26:52] <g33k> I tried using this pluin --> http://sroucheray.org/blog/jquery-dynamic-form/ But the problem is divs A are getting replicated properly. But only div B is getting replicated only in the FIRST div A. Not the other replicated ones.
[01:28:22] <jomofcw> I've got a data parameter in a ajax.success method. data is a valid HTML string. But when I do a $(data).html() it return me "null"... why ?
[01:31:41] <hooloovoo> jomofcw: you can't do it like that. you have to $("<div />").html(data);
[01:31:48] <hooloovoo> jomofcw: then work on that object to get what you want
[01:32:29] <jomofcw> hooloovoo hello and thanks for your answer :)
[01:32:56] <jomofcw> But... my data var is like "<html>...</html>"... including it in a div element is invalid, right ?
[01:33:22] <hooloovoo> jomofcw: pffts, it's not like you're gonna attach it to the dom so screw that =P
[01:33:40] <jomofcw> lol OK you're right ^^ I'll test it.
[01:34:11] <AdamPDotty> should be valid (against some hypothetical DTD
[01:34:41] <jomofcw> Ok it "works" but it remove HTML, HEAD and BODY element :/.
[01:35:07] <hooloovoo> ummm... sounds to me like you're doing something very wrong if you include those by ajax =P
[01:35:23] <jomofcw> Perhaps :/...
[01:35:45] <hooloovoo> only work within the body tag
[01:37:11] <hooloovoo> or preferrably just send json and create the html structure on the frontend
[01:37:19] <hooloovoo> if you want it faster
[01:37:33] <jomofcw> Hm yea I understand it.
[01:54:29] <jomofcw> About the Colorbox plugin, can I easily change the default settings value, without altering source ?
[01:55:38] <jomofcw> I just find the answer in the FAQ xD sorry.
[02:03:23] <Christer_> Has anyone tried using Awesomnium with Lightbox?
[02:05:30] <davetarmac> morning all
[02:05:37] <davetarmac> is there a reason this doesn't work: http://pastebin.com/icQdnasu
[02:06:14] <davetarmac> it's supposed to check if a child a has the class .active and show the content box if it does
[02:08:37] <hooloovoo> davetarmac: make a fiddle of it so we can test
[02:08:46] <hooloovoo> but it'l prolly something wrong with one of your selectors
[02:12:17] <davetarmac> OK, I'll give that a bash
[02:13:47] <klawd_prime> hi!
[02:13:54] <klawd_prime> i want to make a nested list sortable
[02:13:57] <klawd_prime> is such a thing even possible?
[02:14:10] <davetarmac> hooloovoo: http://jsfiddle.net/SBJDZ/  <-- one fiddle, as requested
[02:14:42] <davetarmac> wait - that's not right!
[02:15:12] <hooloovoo> davetarmac: =P
[02:15:23] <AdamPDotty> half a fiddle for a start
[02:16:56] <ravenzz> davetarmac http://jsfiddle.net/SBJDZ/2/
[02:17:09] <davetarmac> screw it - going to take longer to do the fiddle than fix the problem :)
[02:17:34] <davetarmac> and ravenzz proves me wrong
[02:17:35] <davetarmac> :p
[02:18:14] <hooloovoo> davetarmac: doing the fiddle is part of the problem solving =P
[02:18:27] <davetarmac> I'm still getting to grips with it to be honest
[02:18:47] <AdamPDotty> fiddle, problems or solving?
[02:18:55] <davetarmac> fiddle
[02:19:48] <davetarmac> single vs double quote - do they make a difference in js?
[02:20:12] <AdamPDotty> nope
[02:20:37] <AdamPDotty> well, I believe you would need double for eval(), but basically: No
[02:25:17] <davetarmac> worked a treat, thanks ravenzz
[02:26:31] <ravenzz> yw
[02:27:18] <ravenzz> davetarmac I tend to use signle quotes for selectors
[02:27:58] <ravenzz> $('a[href="http://foo.com"]')
[02:28:55] <davetarmac> that's the same system I use ravenzz
[02:29:11] <davetarmac> I was just wondering if there was a best practice way, or if it was down to preference
[02:29:38] <AdamPDotty> it just makes a lot of sense like this
[02:31:50] <ravenzz> it is up to you, but I prefer that approach, I see stuff like $("a[href=\"http://foo.com\"]") made by my back-end colleagues
[02:32:52] <quantum-x> Hi guys - having some issues w/ jqueryMobile - I'm binding a change event to some dropdowns to change the page - They work once, but never work again
[02:33:37] <AdamPDotty> does "changing page" include the dropdowns?
[02:34:14] <quantum-x> Sorry - was just finishing the fiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/kweks/UJU2L/
[02:34:26] <shroomie> hi
[02:34:51] <shroomie> can you suggest jquery plugin for developing neural networks
[02:35:27] <quantum-x> So essentially, it works on the first page load - I can use any dropdown, and it works as expected - but then they don't work again. I've put an alert in the pageinit block - the code is run, but for some reason the binds don't work after the first time
[02:37:09] <AdamPDotty> I am not that familiar with jquery-mobile, but "reloadPage: true" reloads the elements but not the script, right?
[02:37:29] <AdamPDotty> so you got new elements with no handler attached
[02:37:48] <quantum-x> Let me pull that out and see - I'd actually put it in to try to solve the problem
[02:38:32] <quantum-x> yeah, same deal with it removed
[02:40:33] <quantum-x> Or perhaps there's a better way to make the drop downs act as links :)
[02:41:48] <AdamPDotty> I would try on() instead of bind()
[02:42:53] <quantum-x> thanks - I'll try that :)
[02:43:50] <quantum-x> same thing :-/
[02:44:36] <klawd_prime> why does $.post not send empty elements
[02:45:03] <klawd_prime> $.get doesn't either :|
[02:45:36] <Cork> cause that what normal forms does
[02:46:09] <klawd_prime> hot damn that's stupid. :|
[02:46:30] <klawd_prime> so im gonna JSON encode my stuff and decode server side?
[02:46:32] <Cork> klawd_prime: but i'm suspecting your talking about serialize and not $.get and $.post right?
[02:46:40] <klawd_prime> no. actually $.post
[02:46:49] <webdev> hello all.
[02:47:08] <Cork> klawd_prime: $.post('url', { elm:'' }) sends just fine, for example
[02:47:13] <klawd_prime> i want to send an object. in this object there is an element with an empty array as value
[02:47:20] <Cork> klawd_prime: if its really null though thats another matter
[02:47:56] <Cork> klawd_prime: ah, ya { elm:[] } => { 'elm[]': null }
[02:48:05] <Cork> and thats dropped
[02:48:16] <Cork> arrays is a bit special there
[02:48:21] <klawd_prime> i see
[02:48:25] <klawd_prime> that's sucky.
[02:48:35] <Cork> klawd_prime: but { elm:[''] } should be all you need to do
[02:48:39] <klawd_prime> im just gonna give it a null value and change it to an array if it gets elements
[02:49:15] <Cork> obj.elm.push(''); $.post(.., obj)
[02:49:56] <klawd_prime> yeah but then i'll have an empty string as a value on the server side
[02:50:16] <Cork> so always drop the last value in the array
[02:51:00] <Cork> or even better if the variable is missing expect it to mean its an empty array
[02:51:20] <klawd_prime> mh, ill go with null || array
[02:51:23] <klawd_prime> but thanks Cork
[02:51:47] <Cork> null || array will be the same as just typing array
[02:52:01] <Cork> ?eval null || []
[02:52:17] * Cork pokes bot-t
[02:52:22] <antdillon> Is there a reason jQuery show(500) animates from top left and not opacity. I seem to need to animate something opacity and never need it to show from top left?
[02:52:26] <klawd_prime> eh. i meant ill send null or an array
[02:52:31] <klawd_prime> s/ill/null/
[02:52:38] <klawd_prime> scratch that
[02:52:39] <klawd_prime> damn.
[02:52:40] <klawd_prime> lol
[02:52:48] <klawd_prime> Cork: null is being transferred as string
[02:52:50] <Cork> klawd_prime: if you set null the null will be droped
[02:52:59] <Cork> ah, you mean a 'null' or an array
[02:53:02] * Cork nods
[02:55:22] <Trudko> is $(window).load run at same time asi window.onLoad ?
[03:01:35] <Cork> Trudko: more or less
[03:01:46] <Trudko> what do you mean more or less Cork?
[03:02:03] <Cork> onLoad is a legacy accessor for addEventListner('load')
[03:02:22] <Cork> it has the same meaning but it differ slightly in how its invoked
[03:02:57] <Cork> same meaning == its run when the content and images for the page is loaded
[03:03:16] <Cork> Trudko: but noone should be useing domelm.on* anymore
[03:03:38] <Cork> well not for new pages at least
[03:04:17] <Trudko> domelm.on* ?
[03:04:51] <Cork> onclick, onload, onmousemove on...
[03:05:21] <Cork> those are attribute accessors, and that means you can only have one listner for that event on each element
[03:05:53] <Cork> and that causes all kind of conflicts, and should therefor be avoided like the plague
[03:06:30] <Trudko> you can but you can ,,hack" it so you can end up with more isnt that what jquery is doing?!
[03:06:43] <Cork> no
[03:06:51] <Cork> jquery never uses on* attribute accessors
[03:07:06] <Cork> it only uses addEventListner and attachEvent (ie)
[03:07:35] <Trudko> ok
[03:07:37] <Trudko> make sense
[03:08:05] <Trudko> btw reason i asked is because someone told me litterally then jquery load and onload run in different time
[03:08:09] <Trudko> which does not make much sense to me
[03:08:25] <Cork> i think they though of .ready
[03:08:35] <milligan> I'm using jquery to ajax-call a servlet that sets the responsetype to application/octet-stream. I want the servlet to initiate a file download. Can it be done like that ?
[03:08:38] <Cork> load runs ruffly at the same time as onLoad
[03:08:48] <Trudko> so not same time?!
[03:09:21] <Cork> its called by two different parts of the browser
[03:09:25] <miCSu> is it possible to animate div opacity change so that the elements inside the element wouldn't "fade" ?
[03:09:41] <Cork> on* event attributes aren't part of the event loop
[03:09:49] <Cork> its called separately
[03:10:07] <Cork> but like i said, it has the same meanting so its called ruffly at the same time
[03:10:59] <Cork> and by ruffly i mean if you want to run code when page content and images is loaded, use the load event listner not the attribute
[03:11:08] <Cork> the difference isn't big enough to matter
[03:11:25] <Trudko> hmm ok i will need to check that more  did not realize that there is difference between onload and AttackEvent/addEventLIstener
[03:11:28] <Cork> if you want it earlier use .ready
[03:11:41] <Trudko> nah actually I am fixing one IE error
[03:11:52] <Cork> Trudko: on* is dom1 addEventListner/attachEvent listner is dom2
[03:13:34] <Trudko> Cork: btw may I ask you may you wil have some idea. Basicly if you use window moveTo or resizeTo and use is holding left mouse button IE will throw access denied error and one way how to overcome that is run these methods in onLoad I have no idea why it works though
[03:14:53] <Cork> Trudko: ya, that might be some legacy code in ie
[03:15:55] <soee> how can i replace all list elements (<li>s) with data return with ajax call? (so i have returned serialized array and now this array items must jump into dropdown list as separate elements)
[03:17:03] <Cork> soee:  $ul.empty(); data.each(function(post) { $ul.append('<li>' + post + '</li>'); });
[03:17:28] <seutje> innit better to group em all and inject into the DOM once u have em all?
[03:17:28] <Cork> or $ul.empty(); data.each(function(post) { $ul.append($('<li/>').text(post); });
[03:17:49] <Cork> yup thats the third option i was about to write
[03:17:56] <Cork> its a bit messier code though
[03:17:57] <seutje> surrie! :D
[03:18:58] <seutje> var lis = []; data.each(function(post) { lis.push('<li>' + post + '</li>'); }); $ul.html(lis.join('')); ?
[03:18:59] <Cork> or var new_list = []; data.each(function(post) { new_list.push('<li>' + post + '</li>); }); $ul.html(new_list.join(''));
[03:19:04] <Cork> heh :)
[03:19:23] <Cork> almost identical :D
[03:19:45] <seutje> I has less bytes, nanananana pfffffrrrt :P
[03:21:30] <NodeX> How does one give back the dollar to jQUery after no conflict
[03:21:58] <seutje> I'm sorry, that was uncalled for
[03:21:58] <shoky> window.$ = window.jQuery ?
[03:21:59] <Cork> $ = jQuery
[03:22:04] <NodeX> ty ty
[03:22:25] <bigkevmcd> but surely if you are using the "no conflict" option, you don't want to do that?
[03:22:55] <NodeX> I want my widget to give it back afterwards
[03:23:08] <NodeX> incase people are already using jQuery in the page
[03:23:16] <shoky> uh
[03:23:17] <Cork> NodeX: why not just scope your code and leave the page as is?
[03:23:26] <shoky> ye
[03:23:36] <NodeX> my code loads the query library also
[03:23:47] <Cork> (function($) {})(my_lib_should_be_$);
[03:24:03] <NodeX> but if I load jquery library then it overwrites $ no ?
[03:24:10] <Cork> NodeX: a lib should never load another lib, it should require it
[03:24:25] <NodeX> this is a remotely loaded sync widget
[03:24:35] <Cork> still goes
[03:24:36] <NodeX> a bit like how google async load
[03:25:10] <Cork> (function($) {})(jQuery); you code and require the user to provide jquery on there page and your done
[03:25:16] <NodeX> anyway, personal opinions aside, can I still scope
[03:26:14] <NodeX> I wont be doing that^ so is it possible to scope without breaking "$" ?
[03:26:36] <Cork> just use what ever variable you want
[03:27:21] <Cork> (function(me_var, $$, $) {})(jQuery, ExtJS, QT);
[03:27:26] <NodeX> but my point is, loading jquery will break the users $ ... but if I do var $foo=jQuery.noConflict(); .. will that safely wrap MY loaded jquery version in $foo ?
[03:27:46] <NodeX> then I can use $foo and I dont have to worry about giving it back ;)
[03:27:49] <Cork> and you will always break pages if your forcing how a dependency is loaded
[03:27:55] <Cork> and thats why you shouldn't do that
[03:27:58] <NodeX> personal opinions aside
[03:28:05] <Cork> its not personal opinion
[03:28:07] <xec_> it's not a personal opinion
[03:28:08] <NodeX> will loading it as $foo work ?
[03:28:19] <NodeX> it is your opinion and that's great and I appreciate it
[03:28:24] <Cork> you will force how the page works
[03:28:35] <Cork> instead of making your lib work with the page
[03:28:45] <NodeX> the page needs jquery regardless
[03:28:56] <Cork> sure, but you don't know how they will use it
[03:29:07] <Cork> they might be using $j for jquery for all you know
[03:29:12] <NodeX> rather than explaining to people how to load jQUery safely in non jqueryy-ified pages I will just load it- simples
[03:29:17] <Cork> and $ for there private framework
[03:29:38] <Cork> you'll only make the library harder to use, not simpler
[03:29:47] <NodeX> it's not a library
[03:29:55] <NodeX> it's self executing code they never touch
[03:30:11] <NodeX> same concept as analytics..... include a script block and job done
[03:30:32] <Cork> NodeX: if your not creating the page, your a lib/framework used on the page
[03:30:43] <Cork> and if your used, you should make sure you don't conflict with other
[03:30:51] <NodeX> back to my question, if I namespace my $blah=jQuery.noConflict(); and use $blah in my code
[03:30:53] <Cork> and to ensure that, you shouldn't force how things work
[03:31:07] <NodeX> I will make sure I am not conflicting
[03:31:16] <NodeX> personal opinions aside, will namespacing it work
[03:31:20] <Cork> it makes sure it doens't conflict with you code yes
[03:31:23] <NodeX> I dont want a how to on programing
[03:31:25] <Cork> *your
[03:31:25] <NodeX> thanks ;)
[03:31:42] <xec_> ?xy @ NodeX
[03:31:43] <bot-t> NodeX, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[03:32:23] <NodeX> xec_ incorrect sorry
[03:32:46] <NodeX> would you tell the google engineers not to load the analytics lib ?
[03:32:50] <xec_> what you are asking haven't made any sense so far
[03:32:55] <NodeX> and to make sure it's on the page already ?
[03:33:05] <Cork> you will break pages
[03:33:09] <NodeX> or the google maps team to do that too ?
[03:33:18] <NodeX> how will I break pages?
[03:33:22] <Cork> they don't force load dependencies
[03:33:31] <AdamPDotty> well, they do
[03:33:32] <NodeX> they do force load dependancies
[03:33:34] <NodeX> lol
[03:33:42] <NodeX> how do you think they load the maps/analytics
[03:33:43] <Cork> you force specific global variables to be what you want them to be
[03:33:46] <seutje> I recently found out papa crock prefers (function(){}()) over (function(){})()
[03:33:53] <AdamPDotty> and yes, I would tel them to stop that
[03:33:58] <Cork> they have there special name variabels
[03:34:11] <Cork> and those are part of the google api
[03:34:13] <NodeX> I am forcing "my loaded copy" of jquery to use a specific variable ... how is that breaking anything?
[03:34:25] <Cork> thats like forcing that jQuery is jQuery
[03:34:28] <Cork> thats another matter
[03:34:33] <NodeX> i am using my special name variable
[03:34:48] <NodeX> $askjdlaskjdlaskjdaslkdjads=jQuery.noConflict();
[03:34:56] <NodeX> how does that break anything ?
[03:35:09] <Cork> it forces the global page to give up the $ variable
[03:35:18] <Cork> even if the page author doesn't want to
[03:35:21] <NodeX> right so back to my querstion
[03:35:41] <NodeX> how can i safely put my loaded version of jquery into a variable
[03:35:54] <NodeX> and "make them load jquery" is not the answer for me
[03:36:09] <Cork> unless you forbid the original author from using another version of jquery; you can't
[03:36:25] <Cork> jQuery will be overwritten
[03:36:28] <NodeX> can I wrap the entire jquery lib string in a self executing function?
[03:36:39] <Cork> if you mod the jquery library
[03:36:56] <NodeX> can I version detect with jquery ?
[03:36:57] <Cork> and all plugins you want to work with it
[03:37:07] <Cork> jQuery.version
[03:37:13] <NodeX> I dont have a problem detecting if they have it loaded and load if not loaded
[03:37:51] <Cork> sorry its jQuery.fn.jquery
[03:37:54] <Cork> not version
[03:37:58] <Cork> (thats ui)
[03:38:39] <NodeX> what's the first version with on() to listen to future events?
[03:38:46] <NodeX> anyone know off the top of their head/
[03:38:49] <NodeX> * ?
[03:38:50] <Cork> 1.6 i think
[03:38:53] <NodeX> ty
[03:38:54] <Cork> ?.on
[03:38:54] <bot-t> Cork, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[03:39:00] <Cork> 1.7
[03:39:09] <NodeX> dang
[03:39:30] <Cork> (its listed on the api page so just look there)
[03:39:35] <xec_> future events?
[03:39:44] <xec_> you can't listen to past events...?
[03:39:59] <seutje> lol
[03:40:08] <seutje> .ever() :D
[03:40:30] <Cork> well ready listens for past events :)
[03:41:14] <xec_> not really, it just executes the handler if the doc is ready
[03:41:19] <xec_> but yes, that is a special case
[03:41:49] <Cork> it calculates if the event has fired or if it know it has fired, and just calls the handler yes :)
[03:41:59] <Cork> but thats kinda the same (almost)
[03:42:13] <Cork> wasn't really serous though ;)
[03:43:23] <NodeX> is it "window.jQuery" I should be looking for to see initialy if jQuery is loaded?
[03:43:34] <Cork> yes
[03:43:42] <NodeX> something like typeof(window.jQuery)=='object' ?
[03:43:55] <NodeX> if will if(window.jQuery) ... suffice ?
[03:43:56] <Cork> if(!window.jQuery) should be enough
[03:44:27] <seutje> Cork: who are you talking to? o.O
[03:44:49] <Cork> seutje: NodeX
[03:44:53] <Cork> >_>
[03:45:13] <seutje> oh lol, the one lonely guy in my ignore list :x
[03:45:50] <NodeX> I have seutje : ignored so I dunno what he's saying
[03:46:07] <NodeX> s/know/care/
[03:46:11] <Cork> stop bickering
[03:46:23] <Cork> or should i say grow up
[03:46:51] <NodeX> I am not bickering, I just dont like him lol
[03:47:09] <NodeX> anyway, thanks for the help, works a charm
[03:48:14] <Cork> NodeX: but for the future, when ppl say you shouldn't really be doing it in a way, listen to them and explain what problem your trying to solve and let them help you figure out how to solve it correctly
[03:48:17] <Cork> instead of ignoring them
[03:48:36] <Cork> else you will soon see that noone will bother trying to help you
[03:51:03] <NodeX> but you dont know my use case
[03:51:17] <AdamPDotty> yep, thats somehow the point
[03:51:22] <NodeX> and telling me that I should make the user require it is not the answer in my use case
[03:51:25] <Cork> and you should explain the user case
[03:51:31] <Cork> not explain how you want to solve it
[03:51:45] <NodeX> I am still loading jquery if it's the wrong version or not loaded at all
[03:51:57] <Cork> cause that means you often do a solution thats known to be flawed
[03:51:59] <NodeX> I already did explain my use case... a dynimically loaded widget
[03:52:00] <soee> ho can i convert returned json data into javascvript array so i can use .each on it ?
[03:52:14] <Cork> NodeX: no you explained how you wanted it implemented
[03:52:33] <Cork> soee: JSON.parse()
[03:52:35] <NodeX> no I explained "like google analytics load their scripts"
[03:52:51] <NodeX> like/how
[03:52:59] <Cork> soee: or make sure the server returns with the correct mimetype if your using ajax
[03:53:03] <xec_> NodeX: in the case where you load it on top of an old version, you might want to do noConflict(true) so you don't overwrite the jQuery var
[03:53:05] <Cork> soee: and jquery will do it for you
[03:53:11] <soee> Cork, Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token i
[03:53:24] <Cork> then your json isn't valid json
[03:53:38] <Cork> ?g json validate
[03:53:39] <bot-t> Cork, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://jsonlint.com/
[03:53:49] <NodeX> xec_ that would've been a perfect answer
[03:53:51] <soee> Cork, this is returned data: ["id","name","symbol","unit","value_min","value_max","sorting"]
[03:54:08] <NodeX> that's all I needed about 30 mins ago lol
[03:54:13] <Cork> soee: and its not an array to begin with?
[03:54:32] <xec_> NodeX: no way to know that without knowing what you're trying to do. hence the X/Y snippet
[03:56:07] <NodeX> here is what I am trying to do. Load a piece of javascript from my server to the people who included the script (much like how you include google analytics async script on the page), once loaded execute a function that builds a form. End of story
[03:56:30] <NodeX> I dont see what part of that I did not explain properly
[03:57:35] <ntshan> so jsonp?
[03:57:53] <NodeX> me?
[03:58:32] <ntshan> yes
[03:58:46] <ntshan> I just dropped in to the convo but sounds like what you need
[03:58:58] <NodeX> It's all built and running fone
[03:59:00] <NodeX> fine*
[03:59:30] <NodeX> the only thing that was wrong was where people might be using the $ operator from another library and my noConflict() setting -might- have broken it
[03:59:32] <ntshan> oh.  problem solved them :)
[04:00:55] <NodeX> I just now have a race condition where my script is downloaded before jquery but an interval will fix that
[04:04:28] <ntshan> nodex are you using jquery mobile?
[04:05:13] <NodeX> no
[04:05:56] <ntshan> k
[04:06:12] <ntshan> loading of scripts is a bit funky with jqmobile
[04:06:39] <NodeX> I find it a bit bloated tbh
[04:06:51] <NodeX> only jqueryesquq thing I use is jquery itself
[04:06:55] <NodeX> esque*
[04:14:12] <ntshan> right
[04:14:50] <NodeX> gotta keep the apps speedy and all that]
[04:15:45] <ntshan> I agree, but I haven't hit a big slowdown or anything on iOS at least
[04:16:37] <nikych> dsad
[04:29:36] <galymzhan> is it possible to store object literals inside data attributes? something like <tr data-good="{'type':'coin','id':8}">
[04:30:52] <ntshan> well it's just a string I think
[04:31:06] <walidvb_> hi quick question. I get an iframe as an answer from an ajax call, and i would like to replace 400 by 210 within that iframe. for some reason, the 400 within the url is not replaced
[04:31:21] <galymzhan> ntshan: yes, but I want to get back an object when calling $(elem).data('good')
[04:33:00] <ntshan> I think you'd have to parse the string as json
[04:33:14] <ntshan> walid are you talking about dimensions?
[04:36:41] <BlaDe^> hi guys.. is the example here incorrect? http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Data
[04:36:51] <BlaDe^> 'arguments' isn't defined, right?
[04:37:42] <shoky> BlaDe^: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments
[04:37:58] <ntshan> well actually all functions in js have an 'arguments' object
[04:40:54] <BlaDe^> interesting, can you do a function definition like function (string, ...) similar to C formatting functions?
[04:41:18] <ntshan> you don't define types
[04:41:32] <ntshan> in the signature
[04:41:45] <BlaDe^> i know it was an example name
[04:42:06] <BlaDe^> function(someString, ...) to imply that extra arguments would be handled
[04:42:17] <shoky> ?js function bla() { return arguments; }   bla(1,2,'abcde')
[04:42:20] <bot-t> shoky: {}
[04:42:24] <shoky> derp
[04:43:58] <ntshan> you don't need the ...
[04:44:11] <AdamPDotty> leave my dots alone!
[04:44:19] <ntshan> that's a Java thing :)
[04:44:49] <shoky> C thing really ;p
[04:44:51] <ML74> Could someone help me with jQuery.val()? I'm having problems with it changing the value of an <input> properly. It's changing the text, but not the value="" in the tag. Then when I read using val(), I get the original value, regardless of how it's changed. http://glistrr.com/system/tablet/checkin on the plus/minus buttons.
[04:45:41] <shoky> ML74  .val(..) sets the value property. not neccessarily the value attribute
[04:45:50] <shoky> (which is good)
[04:46:08] <ML74> shok: how would i then get the value property? val() returns the original value :/
[04:46:44] <ML74> ** shoky
[04:47:12] <ntshan> are you trying to get the value of that hidden input?
[04:47:20] <shoky> umm where are you using .val?
[04:47:22] <ML74> no, the readonly one
[04:47:33] <ntshan> so set the value
[04:48:11] <ML74> using…? i thought val() did that.
[04:48:24] <shoky> what?
[04:48:32] <ntshan> val reads
[04:48:51] <ML74> sorry, was talking to ntshan.
[04:48:53] <ML74> shoky: http://pastebin.com/KLY2MfgB
[04:49:45] <ntshan> also sets...is supposed to
[04:50:34] <shoky> ML74: what's the problem again?
[04:50:38] <ntshan> are you sure this returns an element: jQuery('[name='+listid+'input]')
[04:51:22] <ML74> ntshan: well it changes the value of the input
[04:51:45] <ML74> although, it's only the visible value. the value"" in the input tag isn't changed.
[04:52:14] <ML74> shoky: when i hit plus, the visible text in the input is changed, however value="" in input tag remains the same
[04:52:32] <shoky> ML74: and that is a problem, why?
[04:52:39] <ML74> then when i use val() to read the value, it reads the original value, regardless of what the text value is
[04:53:04] <ntshan> jQuery('[name='+listid+'input]').attr('value',yourValue); maybe
[04:53:50] <shoky> ML74 where is that code in your site?
[04:54:08] <ML74> it's loaded on the ajax loading page
[04:55:03] <shoky> ML74 are you saying that you set the value with .val(somevalue)
[04:55:03] <ML74> i gotta leave now. will have another crack at it later!
[04:55:07] <shoky> and then read it with .val()
[04:55:12] <ML74> shoky: yeah
[04:55:14] <shoky> and its not the value somevalue ?
[04:55:21] <ML74> yeah :/
[04:55:27] <ML74> i must have something wrong elsewhere.
[04:55:30] <shoky> yap
[04:55:31] <ML74> will fix it later on
[04:57:25] <dns-away> hi
[04:58:12] <dns-away> i need results with images 9example country flags.)
[04:58:27] <dns-away> Here -) http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox
[04:59:04] <dns-away> anyone can hint me ?:-)
[05:01:45] <Pitel_laptop> is there some UI developer? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4681 this bug need to be reopened! http://jsfiddle.net/aCr5E/1/
[05:02:57] <ansolas> @dns-away: I found this on google: http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/branches/labs/selectmenu/index.html
[05:03:44] <ansolas> "Default: "popup" Style with custom icon images" should do the job :)
[05:04:21] <ansolas> source: https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&q=jqueryui+combobox+icons
[05:04:25] <dns-away> Thanks, but
[05:04:27] <dns-away> I need exactly for #combobox :-)
[05:04:34] <ansolas> ?
[05:05:46] <ansolas> with autocomplete?
[05:06:09] <xec_> Pitel_laptop: maybe try #jqueryui-dev
[05:06:32] <dns-away> Yes, DropDown + AutoComplete.)
[05:07:22] <dns-away> But I don't see options for images in dropdown in combobox.-)
[05:07:26] <kborchers> Pitel_laptop: that has been fixed in master, not 1-8-stable. it will be fixed in 1.9 which should be released soon
[05:07:47] <kborchers> Pitel_laptop: check the topic for the link to the RC

[05:08:55] <kborchers> about time bot-t :P
[05:14:15] <ansolas> @dns: probably you can combine both somehow , the icon example and the autocomplete, both have a select underneith
[05:15:10] <dns-away> it's solved now.
[05:15:24] <dns-away> thanks for the help.!-)
[05:21:16] <ansolas> do you like to show me the result please?
[05:54:02] <klj613> does .height() .width() do something weird? i get w/h of a textarea. replace the textarea (exactly same markup) and set h/w on it. and each time it loses like 10px of w/h each
[05:54:14] <klj613> (the size of textarea is determined by end user by resizing it)

[06:01:58] <nuggie> hi
[06:03:13] <nuggie>  one problem: i have a XML with the following structure: <data><functions><function><id>1</id>...</funcion>....</functions></data>
[06:03:37] <nuggie> now I want to select one specific function node by its id element
[06:04:12] <nuggie> "$("data > functions > function:has(>id:contains('1')), xml)" is working, but "$("data > functions > function:has(>id:eq('13')), xml)" not
[06:04:42] <nuggie> ?problem with the first one: I get all function elements like with an ID like 11 12 13
[06:04:46] <bot-t> nuggie, #11315 (Problems with delegate() and :first in nested elements with ... - Opened 7 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11315
[06:06:14] <nuggie> hm
[06:07:32] <BlaDe^> should this work? $('<img />').data({imageCode: item.code, imageTitle: item.title});
[06:08:43] <shoky> depends what you consider "work"
[06:09:31] <nuggie> i cannot find one single example with a combination of :has and :eq
[06:09:33] <nuggie> oO
[06:10:54] <shoky> nuggie what do you think :eq does ?
[06:10:59] <kborchers> nuggie: :eq() matches the index, not the content
[06:11:13] <kborchers> http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/
[06:11:17] <BlaDe^> shoky:  console.log($('theImage').data()); is returning an empty object
[06:11:30] <shoky> BlaDe^: theImage ?
[06:11:40] <BlaDe^> it's passed by an event, not a selector I can show
[06:11:51] <BlaDe^> but is the problem with how i'm setting the data or somewhere else?
[06:11:53] <nuggie> kborchers: hm ok,but how to select the parent of a node containing my searched id ?
[06:12:01] <shoky> BlaDe^: i dont know what you're doing, do i
[06:12:26] <BlaDe^> shoky: i was asking if $('<img />').data({ }); is valid to set data.. the page only shows jQuery.data(elem, key, value);
[06:12:34] <shoky> BlaDe^: you're setting the data on a new <img> element, and you're using some 'item' object that i have no clue about.
[06:13:04] <shoky> what page..
[06:13:13] <BlaDe^> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[06:13:24] <xdjuj> You should precise the data you want to see
[06:13:24] <shoky> you don't need $.data
[06:13:48] <xdjuj> jQuery('img').data('something');
[06:13:54] <shoky> BlaDe^: http://api.jquery.com/data/
[06:14:02] <BlaDe^> ah that'll be why ;)
[06:14:06] <xdjuj> You will get the data-something="value" on the IMG
[06:14:13] <nuggie> kborchers:  $("data > functions > function > id:eq(13)", xml).parent() is working, but I cannot use this as a xmlreader-root for jqgrid
[06:14:49] <BlaDe^> xdjuj: that isn't happening
[06:15:08] <xdjuj> BlaDe^ => $('<img />') are you sure that's not $('img') that you need ? :)
[06:15:27] <BlaDe^> xdjuj: nope i'm creating a new image

[06:15:52] <AdamPDotty> nuggie: cant you have the id as attribute?
[06:15:53] <ajpiano> nuggie: if you want to parse xml, please use $.parseXML( xmlstring )
[06:15:59] <ajpiano> ?parseXML @ nuggie
[06:15:59] <bot-t> nuggie, jQuery.parseXML(data): Parses a string into an XML document. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[06:16:22] <ajpiano> BlaDe^: what you are showing should work, according to the docs, if it is n't, please show a fiddle demo
[06:17:02] <nuggie> AdamPDotty: this could be a workaround
[06:17:06] <Trudko> Guys most JS validation libraries I found use javascript objects for setting validation rules and messages, shouldnt we use something more HTML 5 like? - custom attributes use data- attribute for other validation maybe?
[06:17:59] <nuggie> ajpiano: jqGrid needs xml strings when you don't want to reload the data
[06:18:05] <AdamPDotty> you could have a look at .filter()
[06:18:23] <ajpiano> that doesn't mean *you* need an exml string if you need to do some parsing on your own
[06:18:50] <ravenzz> Trudko those would be meaningless if the validation script is not running
[06:18:58] <nuggie> ajpiano: yeah, a workaround is extracting the part of the xml before .. you're right
[06:19:13] <Trudko> ravenzz: what do you mean?
[06:19:17] <Trudko> and Hi
[06:19:22] <ravenzz> Hi
[06:19:48] <BlaDe^> ajpiano:  http://jsfiddle.net/4Ybwk/
[06:20:02] <BlaDe^> simplified it a bit but the problem is still there
[06:20:43] <ravenzz> <input type="text" name="foo" required data-validate="whatever">  is useless if you don't have a plugin which actually do something with that attribute
[06:21:21] <ravenzz> imo you should leave the markup as clean as possible
[06:21:57] <ajpiano> Trudko: have you seen h5validate
[06:22:46] <ajpiano> BlaDe^: what's wrong, the data is being set.
[06:22:49] <Trudko> ajpiano: no wil lcheck it!
[06:22:55] <BlaDe^> ajpiano:  not for me
[06:23:09] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/4Ybwk/1/
[06:23:44] <Trudko> ravenzz: seems like obvious ofc that wont work without script what JS validation would  ?:) my point is that html uses attributes for validation , so why not to start with that already
[06:23:55] <BlaDe^> ajpiano:  ok that works but I don't see it in the markup in inspect element?
[06:24:20] <shoky> you're not supposed to
[06:24:30] <ajpiano> BlaDe^: data sets.... the the internal jQuery data, not data- atttrs
[06:24:31] <Trudko> ajpiano: and what do you tink about this approrach rather then some object wihere you pass settings?
[06:24:44] <BlaDe^> 15:14 < xdjuj> You will get the data-something="value" on the IMG
[06:24:57] <shoky> BlaDe^: did you bother reading the docs?
[06:24:59] <BlaDe^> ajpiano:  ok, the actual issue i'm having though is that it doesn't appear in the callback
[06:25:05] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: the code for jQuery.Color.hook in 2.1.0 might point you in the right direction
[06:25:05] <BlaDe^> shoky:  yes but I was on the wrong page originally
[06:25:13] <ajpiano> that isn't reflected in this fiddle, BlaDe^
[06:25:13] <shoky> and you got the right link
[06:25:23] <BlaDe^> .bind('img photoSelect.select', function(e) { console.log('select', $(this).data()); }); gives me an empty object
[06:25:26] <BlaDe^> i'll update the fiddle
[06:25:42] <ajpiano> BlaDe^: brb in 5 mins
[06:25:46] <BlaDe^> ok
[06:26:47] <ravenzz> Trudko that's how a good plugin is supposed to "start"
[06:27:23] <ravenzz> required and type attribute
[06:28:30] <Trudko> ravenzz: ? myPluginValidate(" someForm" ) ? not sure
[06:30:03] <BlaDe^> damnit.. I found the problem ajpiano .. thanks for yhour help
[06:30:04] <BlaDe^> your*
[06:30:12] <ravenzz> buh $('form').validate() ?
[06:30:31] <BlaDe^> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/4Ybwk/2/ is my code though, does it look ok as my first jQuery plugin? :)
[06:30:44] <BlaDe^> so far.
[06:31:31] <Trudko> ravenzz: or tat not sure what is problem
[06:32:17] <Trudko> ajpiano: btw from lib. website you told me about " Implements best practices based on 1,000 user survey, several usability studies, and the behavior of millions of users in live production environments."
[06:32:19] <Trudko> those are some big words
[06:32:42] <ajpiano> the author of the plugin also frequents this channel
[06:32:46] <ajpiano> and those aren't relaly big words
[06:33:18] <Trudko> ajpiano: then I am just easily impressed :D
[06:33:24] <ajpiano> lol
[06:33:35] <ajpiano> well i couldn't tell if you were impressed or overwhelmed  lol
[06:34:40] <Trudko> hh btw that seem like way how JS valid. should look like - it should be HTML 5 like , I dont think that putting validation rules to html is that bad
[06:36:16] <BlaDe^> ajpiano:  it works now with singular events but: .bind('photoSelect.select, photoSelect.deselect' doens't trigger
[06:36:26] <BlaDe^> is that not allowed?
[06:37:17] <shoky> BlaDe^ use a space not a comma, i think
[06:37:30] <BlaDe^> yep that was it, thanks
[06:37:45] <BlaDe^> so a comma for element selectors and a space for events?
[06:37:50] <ajpiano> BlaDe^: you also should make sure you stick to binding namespaced event properly
[06:37:53] <MrDup> Hi all
[06:38:04] <hooloovoo> Hi MrDup!
[06:38:12] <ajpiano> sometimes you have click.foo and others foo.click
[06:39:05] <BlaDe^> ajpiano:  yeah you're right, i'll change it
[06:39:16] <MrDup> I would like to know if there's a mean to wait a method to be completed before continuing execution of my script.
[06:39:28] <BlaDe^> if I .bind('photoSelect') is that considered correct? then I can switch e.type
[06:39:57] <MrDup> Maybe it's a javascript instruction I need, but I'm beginner and I don't know a instruction that could help me.
[06:41:21] <BlaDe^> the docs show .unbind('.namespace') but not .bind('namespace')
[06:41:26] <shoky> MrDup:  a mean to wait a method?  i suppose you want setTimeout
[06:41:27] <BlaDe^> .namespace*
[06:41:32] <shoky> BlaDe^: yep
[06:41:42] <shoky> BlaDe^: .bind('.photoSelect')
[06:41:42] <BlaDe^> shoky:  yep it should work?
[06:41:48] <BlaDe^> ok thanks
[06:41:57] <shoky> BlaDe^: and .bind('select.photoSelect deselect.photoSelect')   for example
[06:42:35] <BlaDe^> shoky:  select.photoSelect works, .photoSelect doesn't
[06:42:45] <Grundell> Does any one remebmer what the adress is to the weboage where you show someone how to search on google
[06:42:45] <shoky> BlaDe^: what are you triggering./
[06:42:47] <shoky> ?
[06:43:01] <BlaDe^> .trigger('select.photoSelect');
[06:43:06] <shoky> Grundell: lmgtfy
[06:43:27] <Grundell> Thanks mate
[06:43:30] <shoky> BlaDe^:  then .bind('.photoSelect') should catch that..
[06:43:39] <MrDup> shoky: not really, in fact, I'm modifying a code where the jstree plugin is used. But it seems to proceed modifications on my DOM in 'background', so I don't know how to perform some actions after those modifications are done.
[06:43:53] <BlaDe^> shoky:  it isn't :(
[06:44:10] <shoky> MrDup: i dont know the plugin, but probably by hooking into events emitted by the plugin.
[06:44:20] <shoky> MrDup: that's how it usually works..
[06:44:31] <shoky> you supply a callback or bind to an event
[06:44:57] <MrDup> following the documentation of jstree, it doesn't seem to support it. :/
[06:45:19] <faraway> BlaDe^: trigger('photoSelect');
[06:45:27] <MrDup> Hm, I'll try it anyway. To be sure.
[06:45:46] <BlaDe^> MrDup:  there is events
[06:45:52] <faraway> BlaDe^: eh sotty
[06:46:06] <BlaDe^>  }).bind("open_node.jstree", function (e, d) { and  }).bind("close_node.jstree", function (e, d) { for example
[06:46:08] <faraway> BlaDe^: sorry. just pass the event ? is it then working ?
[06:46:17] <BlaDe^> i haven't used it for a long time but those are the ones I have in my src
[06:46:33] <MrDup> BlaDe^: okay, I take a look
[06:46:51] <BlaDe^> faraway: faraway .bind('select.photoSelect') works, .bind('.photoSelect') doesn't
[06:47:07] <shoky> BlaDe^: ah sorry you cant bind to a namespace..
[06:47:19] <BlaDe^> that'll be why it isn't in the docs heh, ok np
[06:48:30] <MrDup> BlaDe^: okay, I just found "loaded.jstree" event. I should be okay
[06:48:33] <MrDup> It*
[06:48:44] <BlaDe^> yep
[06:51:38] <MrDup> BlaDe^: hm, the event doesn't seem to be triggered. :/
[06:51:57] <MrDup> Oh wait...
[06:53:17] <MrDup> Okay, triggered, but I always have my problem.
[06:58:51] <foo> This is my code: http://pastebin.com/0Kgk0VhM - for some reason, it doesn't get triggered between page 1 to page 2. Specifically, see line 10 . That's not returning true. Any ideas on what might cause this?
[07:00:15] <foo> haha, I know why.
[07:00:51] <foo> It only triggers when clicked. How can I get it to trigger on page load? Hmm, or, how can I click it with jquery?
[07:00:55] <foo> eg. simulate a click
[07:04:17] <faraway> foo: .trigger("click")  would call it. but you should think of another way i think. like calling a function scrollToXXX on page load. and .click(scrollToXXX)
[07:05:46] <foo> faraway: thank you, yeah, I'm doing that. Basically, we use accordion and someone goes from /#tab1 to /#tab2. The problem is when someone goes from /#tab1 to /home-ch#tab2. /home-ch is the chinese version of the home page, and #tab2 is opened. But, since #tab2 isn't clicked, it doesn't automatically scroll to #tab2. My solution: check if a hash exists, if so, then figure out what it is and scroll to that tab
[07:07:41] <faraway> foo: and what is the problem then ?
[07:08:25] <foo> faraway: the problem was, per my pastebin, the page only scrolls to the open tab if it's clicked. When the English to Chinese page translation happens (jumping from one tab to another tab on another page), the tab is already open (not clicked), and thus the page doesn't automatically scroll to the open tab
[07:09:05] <faraway> foo: "check if a hash exists, if so, then figure out what it is and scroll to that tab"  ?
[07:09:52] <foo> faraway: sorry, check if #tab2 is in the URL (because if it is, that means it's already open, it wasn't clicked, and it automatically needs to scroll to that tab
[07:11:03] <faraway> foo: if( window.loaction.hash == "#tab2") { ....scrollTo ... } ?
[07:11:16] <foo> faraway: exactly, that's the solution
[07:11:16] <faraway> foo: window.location
[07:11:55] <faraway> foo: so your question was how to get that hash form the current url ?
[07:12:29] <foo> faraway: my question was solved. :) It was "why it wasn't working". The answer: the tabs weren't clicked. I got it, thanks :)
[07:12:40] <foo> (I solved it in the midst of asking about it)
[07:12:59] <faraway> foo: you confused me :D
[07:13:09] <foo> :D No problem. I may have another question shortly, though, ha
[07:20:19] <foo> Ok, I have this: http://pastebin.com/cK9Q7fg0 - how can I make it run this when dom is ready? I tried replacing .click with .ready but it didn't seem to work. I'm trying to automatically scroll that area
[07:20:57] <foo> I know this is just my lack of jquery-fu,ha
[07:21:12] <foo> faraway: eg. I was trying this: v
[07:21:48] <foo>   $('.navigation1 > .team').scrollIt(260);
[07:22:29] <seutje> $(document).ready(function() { $('.navigation1 > .team').scrollIt(260); }); but I have no clue what $.fn.scrollIt is
[07:22:49] <foo> seutje: ahh, that would make sense
[07:25:03] <foo> seutje: hm, this doesn't seem to work:  $(document).ready(function() { $('.navigation1 > .team').alert('scrolling it to 260'); });  - I want to get this alert on page load. Hmph.
[07:25:58] <seutje> alert is a method of the window object, it's not a method on jQuery collections
[07:26:33] <seutje> so use alert('foo'); or make a useless jQuery.fn.alert
[07:27:16] <seutje> $('something').alert('foo') should give you an error like "object does not have a method alert"
[07:28:08] <foo> seutje: ah, ok. I'm trying to rule out that it's working, and not that my function isn't working
[07:28:44] <seutje> foo: don't use alert for debugging, it breaks more than it fixes
[07:28:46] <seutje> ?alert
[07:28:46] <bot-t> Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[07:28:59] <foo> seutje: thanks, will try that
[07:31:07] <foo> seutje: http://pastebin.com/QNjdEV2m - like this?
[07:31:31] <foo> seutje: that doesn't seem to be outputting to console log (using chrome's web debugger in console tab)
[07:31:56] <seutje> foo: do you get an error like "object does not have a method scrollIt"?
[07:32:13] <seutje> because it looks like you're just trying to call a function, but call it as if it were a jQuery method
[07:32:43] <foo> seutje: nope, hmm
[07:32:43] <seutje> so I guess my question is: why do you keep putting that $('.navigation1 > .team') in front of it?
[07:33:19] <foo> seutje: good question :) originally, I am trying to scroll that (where that matches)
[07:34:36] <seutje> ?g jquery scrollto
[07:34:36] <bot-t> seutje, jQuery.ScrollTo - http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[07:34:44] <seutje> might be useful
[07:35:29] <foo> haha.
[07:35:51] <seutje> it allows you to just $(window).scrollTo('someelement', 500) where 500 is the duration
[07:35:57] <foo> seutje: so, it looks like I don't need "scrollIt" if I can just use "scrollTo"
[07:36:45] <seutje> I don't even know wtf scrollIt is :P
[07:36:56] <foo> seutje: I declared it in that last pastebin
[07:37:15] <foo> c:)
[07:37:44] <mattyh88> hey, i'm doing this: $("input[id$=query]").val(); but I would like to filter even more than just on element, i'd like to get input type text only. how could i do that pls
[07:40:25] <foo> seutje: weird, $(window).scrollTo('.navigation1 > .team', 500); breaks my accordion.
[07:41:12] <foo> seutje: error: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'scrollTo'
[07:42:14] <NJL> is there a way to have a function run when an object becomes available?
[07:42:23] <seutje> foo: well you have to include the plugin
[07:42:44] <ThaDick> NJL: Can you explain a little more? What do you mean by "becomes available?"
[07:42:57] <NJL> ThaDick: well let me try to explain my issue
[07:43:42] <NJL> ThaDick: I have a datatable that's being loaded with ajax when a tab is clicked, and when you click away and come back, I'd like to have that datatable be reloaded to refresh it
[07:44:03] <NJL> ThaDick: I'm in a magento framework, so the best I can figure is to attach a listener to the tab to do the reload
[07:44:16] <NJL> ThaDick: but the object isn't available immediately
[07:45:24] <ThaDick> "click away and come back" … does this mean that you are losing focus then reapplying focus?
[07:45:35] <seutje> think he means change tabs
[07:45:41] <ThaDick> oh
[07:45:56] <seutje> doesn't the tab thing you're using have callbacks?
[07:46:05] <ThaDick> just do .focus(function(){})
[07:46:29] <NJL> I wish I could explain better heh
[07:46:41] <NJL> ThaDick: that's essentially what I tried, but it won't work in this case
[07:46:56] <ThaDick> Is there a way to count the number of "data-" attributes on an element?
[07:51:24] <foo> seutje: you said I was calling console.log wrong. What's the right way to do this? console.log("how to do this"); doesn't seem to work like I had it
[07:53:11] <Gho5t> console.log( whatevertheheckyouwant);
[07:53:12] <seutje> foo: I said that?
[07:54:07] <seutje> foo: does the browser you're trying this in have a console?
[07:57:37] <foo> seutje: yeah, chrome's web inspector has console. I don't see anything in there (my message or an error)
[07:57:49] <foo> actually, that's probably because this isn't working
[07:58:05] <seutje> that's mighty odd
[07:58:14] <seutje> so your chrome is broken? o.O
[07:59:40] <foo> seutje: what if I just put console.log("does this work"); outside of a function, I get no errors for that and nothing in console log
[07:59:43] <foo> hmm
[08:02:16] <foo> what should $(document).ready(function() { $('.navigation1 > .team').scrollIt(260); }); do? I don't think this is working.
[08:04:05] <seutje> I dunno, but from what I understand, scrollIt is a regular function and not a jquery method, so I guess that should give an error
[08:04:35] <foo> seutje: this is the function: http://pastebin.com/irqWzSMp
[08:04:39] <foo> seutje: it doesn't give an error
[08:04:59] <foo> it just doesn't do anything
[08:06:08] <foo> seutje: before I had this: http://pastebin.com/Z3jnNh9L - the way it worked: when you clicked on that area (.team), it scrolled to 260. I am trying to make it so it loads on page load
[08:06:12] <foo> (and not when clicked)
[08:07:12] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/9YvDw/
[08:08:32] <seutje> foo: ^
[08:08:35] <seutje> or http://jsfiddle.net/9YvDw/1/
[08:08:51] <foo> seutje: haha, I guess, $('.navigation1 > .team') isn't relevant at all in this...
[08:08:51] <seutje> first one is a regular function, second one is a jquery method
[08:09:00] <foo> err. I am really out of it today
[08:09:05] <seutje> no, that's why I asked you why you were adding it all the time
[08:09:27] <foo> seutje: I'm sorry man, thanks for being tolerant. It's one of those mornings... and I have to get this done so I can pick up a friend from the airport.
[08:09:33] <jory> Can you pass an array to $.when()?
[08:09:35] * foo tries that
[08:09:47] <seutje> foo: s'ok, it's friday evening for me :D
[08:09:51] <foo> seutje: :)
[08:09:55] <foo> seutje: cheers
[08:10:26] <daslicht> :)
[08:10:38] <daslicht> foo , lets go to a bar :)
[08:10:43] <seutje> jory: I'd say no
[08:10:46] <foo> daslicht: haha
[08:10:49] <seutje> but...
[08:10:50] <daslicht> :)
[08:10:50] <seutje> ?tias
[08:10:50] <bot-t> Try It And See
[08:11:22] <jory> seutje: Not a bad idea!
[08:13:46] <daslicht> huh goohl;e is down ?
[08:13:49] <daslicht> google
[08:17:43] <xtrpt> hello guys, can anyone give me some help please? i have an on submit handler that sends to a php script the values in a form and it works well, thing is, when i call another function that makes a .load if i want to submit the form that i said earlier it send's the post content in blank, it can successfully make a .post but with no values
[08:18:56] <daslicht> not clear to me
[08:19:20] <daslicht> you say , i call another function ,,, whoch ?
[08:19:23] <daslicht> which ?
[08:19:27] <daslicht> example ?
[08:19:30] <daslicht> fiddle ?
[08:19:43] <xtrpt> gonna send
[08:19:48] <xtrpt> just one second
[08:20:20] <daslicht> yeah
[08:20:30] <daslicht> easiert for anyone here to follow :)
[08:20:33] <daslicht> easier
[08:21:59] <xtrpt> daslicht:
[08:21:59] <xtrpt> here
[08:22:02] <xtrpt> http://jsfiddle.net/ZjWNv/
[08:22:37] <xtrpt> my problem is in that tag() function
[08:23:12] <xtrpt> it works well if i only use it, but when i call viewTags()
[08:23:54] <xtrpt> the tag() function sends the post values without content
[08:25:32] <xtrpt> but it's weird because in console.log inside the function i have the values working
[08:25:51] <xtrpt> but in the script it print's no values
[08:25:51] <btipling> god I'd like to have a call stack in onerror
[08:26:30] <btipling> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=355430
[08:26:32] <btipling> :(
[08:26:48] <btipling> hrm
[08:27:32] <daslicht> @xtrpt : I would try to isolate the issue and craete a smaler piect of code
[08:27:58] <daslicht> i doubt that many are motivated in here to dig trogh so many lines :)
[08:28:21] <btipling> https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=147127 <--- please star if you would also like to see a call stack in onerror :O
[08:28:27] <btipling> would be so useful
[08:29:10] <btipling> I can't tell what some of these users are experiencing because the bugs all terminate in jquery somewhere
[08:29:34] <btipling> and so the onerror message is like object is undefined in jquery min
[08:29:52] <btipling> but the real error is in my application code somewhere, I just can't reproduce, so a callstack would be super useful
[08:30:42] <daslicht> @xtrpt : i dont see a realtion of viewtags and tags ? there is no call to the tag function in the viewtags function
[08:30:43] <daslicht> ?
[08:31:48] <daslicht> @xtrpt : is "<?=base_url()?>galeria/echoTags/" + id  retunding something?
[08:32:00] <daslicht> returning

[08:43:22] <xtrpt> http://www.7noites.com/galeria/v2/90#7
[08:43:25] <xtrpt> it's in portuguese
[08:43:56] <xtrpt> but when you click on  "identifica alguém na foto"
[08:44:01] <xtrpt> it opens the form to send the data
[08:44:16] <xtrpt> calling the function tags()
[08:44:28] <xtrpt> the problem is when you click on "ver pessoas nesta foto"
[08:44:45] <xtrpt> if i want to post something again on the form down
[08:44:48] <xtrpt> it will not work
[09:01:43] <granden> Is it javascript or CSS if I wanna set the background color of text when marking it in the browser?
[09:03:02] <johnkpaul> granden: "marking"?
[09:03:14] <granden> hmm dont know the english word for it.
[09:03:22] <granden> But when holding left mouse button and makeing a selection
[09:03:27] <johnkpaul> highlighting
[09:03:29] <johnkpaul> in webkit there is
[09:03:40] <granden> Only webkit no other browsers?
[09:04:17] <johnkpaul> granden: I am fairly sure that it is webkit only
[09:04:37] <johnkpaul> granden: http://www.quirksmode.org/css/selection.html
[09:04:39] <ShooterMG> anyone know of a good plugin that will skin a div with rounded corners that i provide?
[09:04:43] <johnkpaul> it's not webkit only, I was wrong granden
[09:04:53] <johnkpaul> take a look at that link
[09:05:03] <expando-> greetings from bulgaria to all of you
[09:05:29] <wolfehr> is change() triggered if an element is programmatically updated instead of by user interaction?
[09:06:34] <johnkpaul> wolfehr: no, you need to manually tirgger change
[09:06:36] <johnkpaul> trigger*
[09:06:44] <granden> johnkpaul: Thanks!
[09:06:47] <johnkpaul> granden: np
[09:06:49] <johnkpaul> have fun!
[09:07:01] <expando-> i would ask you when i have myDiv.bind('getData', function(evt, key, value) {
[09:07:02] <expando-> 		alert('GET key: ' + key + ', value: ' + value);
[09:07:02] <expando-> 	});
[09:07:20] <expando-> why the value is "undefined"?
[09:07:48] <johnkpaul> expando-: how do you trigger the getData event
[09:08:17] <expando-> myDiv.data('myKey', 'myValue')
[09:09:07] <expando-> i'm sorry
[09:09:28] <granden> johnkpaul: Works like a charm, but got a bit of problem with all my empty spaces, br and such. They get blue. Any way to set those as well?
[09:09:41] <granden> Not only br but all empty space
[09:09:42] <johnkpaul> granden: hmm, I don't know, you should ask #css
[09:10:06] <expando-> var program = myDiv.data('myKey');
[09:10:15] <expando-> it is how i trigger the event
[09:10:24] <granden> johnkpaul: Oh ok.
[09:10:27] <granden> Thanks again though
[09:10:33] <johnkpaul> granden: no problem
[09:10:55] <expando-> if i use previous one it is not triggered
[09:11:06] <expando-> i'm using google jQuery1.3.2
[09:11:24] <johnkpaul> expando-: hmm, I don't know much about those data custom events
[09:11:31] <expando-> o'reylly
[09:11:34] <johnkpaul> oh wow, pretty old version of jquery there
[09:11:35] <expando-> coockbook
[09:12:15] <expando-> <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js"
[09:12:15] <expando-> type="text/javascript"></script>
[09:12:29] <expando-> it is my jquery inclusion
[09:12:30] <johnkpaul> expando-: don't paste code into the channel
[09:12:51] <expando-> is it a some bug in 1.3.2?
[09:13:03] <expando-> i may try with a different version
[09:14:26] <silverwind> 1.3.2 is prehistoric.
[09:14:32] <expando-> ok
[09:14:43] <expando-> i'll try to use different version
[09:14:53] <expando-> but it is used in my book
[09:15:06] <silverwind> That's why all books about jquery suck.
[09:15:07] <expando-> and i'm trying to be as close as possible to the book sources
[09:15:39] <expando-> indeed in my last company we haven't html/javascript developer
[09:16:01] <expando-> and it was my responsibility to fix javascript/jquery components
[09:16:08] <expando-> without knowing jquery :)
[09:16:12] <expando-> it was very funny
[09:16:18] <silverwind> :)
[09:16:55] <expando-> i'm a java developer in the real life
[09:17:41] <silverwind> And a jQuery developper in false life :D
[09:17:56] <expando-> it is a parallel reality
[09:18:00] <seutje> ?mdn getdata
[09:18:02] <bot-t> seutje, Couldn't find "mdn getdata" in jQuery Docs.
[09:18:11] <silverwind> I'm personally a weird frontend/backend dev... they seem to be rare.
[09:18:12] <johnkpaul> seutje: it's a jquery custom event I believe
[09:18:17] <johnkpaul> an undocumented one so it seems
[09:18:26] <expando-> it is not a custom event
[09:18:29] <seutje> ?source getdata
[09:18:29] <bot-t> Line#1697 - "data = this.triggerHandler("getData" + parts[1] + "!", [parts[0]]);" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#1697
[09:18:36] <seutje> ah
[09:18:55] <johnkpaul> I was trying to figure out what parts[1] +"!" is
[09:19:01] <johnkpaul> but then I got sidetracked with real work :)
[09:19:55] <expando-> does it mean i should debug jquery source code?
[09:20:40] <johnkpaul> expando-: using the unminified version and debugging through it would probably help you
[09:20:57] <expando-> the books are very impressive
[09:21:09] <expando-> but when you go deeper in the details
[09:21:20] <expando-> or in a real project
[09:21:25] <johnkpaul> expando-: that's true for anything
[09:21:28] <johnkpaul> a book can only teach you so much
[09:21:53] <expando-> most of the things become more complicated and the management is not very happy :)
[09:22:02] <expando-> ok
[09:22:12] <seutje> expando-: looks like it only triggers when no value was given
[09:22:17] <seutje> hence *get*Data
[09:22:30] <seutje> so it only passes the event object and the key you were *getting*
[09:22:33] <expando-> it is before
[09:22:47] <expando-> myDiv.data('myKey')
[09:22:59] <johnkpaul> oh I see, seutje
[09:23:09] <johnkpaul> expando-: so the reason that value is undefined is that your handler is only being called with the name
[09:23:13] <johnkpaul> you can lookup the value if you need to yourself
[09:23:42] <expando-> if in the event handler i call return 'newVal';
[09:23:49] <expando-> i ovveride the value returned
[09:24:15] <expando-> so i think it must be possible to do some conditional logic, based on the actual value
[09:24:22] <expando-> and it should be possible
[09:24:25] <expando-> but how?!
[09:24:26] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/vzLAw/
[09:24:28] <expando-> :)
[09:25:06] <seutje> you'd need to monkey patch $.fn.data I thinks
[09:25:39] <johnkpaul> seutje: why?, this is the dom element
[09:25:50] <expando-> .data('poo', 'bla') // no log at all
[09:26:03] <expando-> the reason for this is you are calling the setter
[09:26:11] <expando-> and probably the event is not fired at all
[09:26:17] <johnkpaul> hm, but there is no way to disbale the event
[09:26:25] <johnkpaul> so it's an infiniteloop
[09:26:25] <seutje> didn't I say that like 20-30 lines ago?
[09:26:41] <seutje> <seutje> expando-: looks like it only triggers when no value was given
[09:26:51] <expando-> yes
[09:27:35] <expando-> but why then it have 'undefined' value?
[09:27:36] <seutje> http://pastebin.com/DhcGGMEF <- this is .data() (in 1.8)
[09:28:15] <seutje> note the if (value === undefined)
[09:28:34] <seutje> right before the triggerHandler call
[09:29:05] <seutje> a little lower it does seem to trigger them, but then the trigger becomes key specific?
[09:29:30] <ag4ve> what do they mean by context here: jQuery( selector [, context] )
[09:29:38] <expando-> is it a bug in jquery 1.3.2?
[09:29:45] <ag4ve> i'm trying to figure out what gr does here: $("tbody > tr.jqgrow > td:nth-child("+(pos+1)+")",gr[0]);
[09:30:35] <expando-> gr - seems to be some array - collection
[09:30:55] <expando-> and it is probably defined somewhere above
[09:31:31] <ag4ve> sure, it is: http://www.ok-soft-gmbh.com/jqGrid/NonEditableCellsDynamic.htm
[09:31:46] <ag4ve> ... but, i don't know what context does?
[09:32:57] <ag4ve> i haven't looked at the jqgrid api, but i'm guessing gr[0] there is the first defined grid
[09:33:33] <houman> I have a div like this: <div class="modal hide" id="salesitems_modal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myModalLabel" aria-hidden="true">   </div>  When I try to empty it with jquery, Firebug crashes.  $('#salesitems_modal').empty();   Any idea what could cause it?  How can I see the raised exception in Firebug?
[09:34:10] <Gho5t> maybe the console
[09:34:12] <Gho5t> or try in chrome
[09:34:25] <ag4ve> oh, context would default to window unless defined?
[09:34:39] <expando-> context is the document
[09:34:43] <expando-> by default i think
[09:34:58] <ag4ve> err right, got it. thanks
[09:35:08] <expando-> what about my  problem?
[09:35:30] <expando-> do i need to override jQuery default behaviour?
[09:37:40] <expando-> it is probably valid for jQuery1.3.2 and jQuery1.8.0
[09:37:49] <expando-> that this behaviour is the same
[09:38:09] <expando-> could someone to tell me a workaround if it is a jquery issue?
[09:38:40] <seutje> expando-: what is it you want to do? do something when some data attribute is changed?
[09:38:59] <expando-> i would like to extract the actual data value
[09:39:06] <expando-> in getData event handler
[09:39:54] <expando-> for example to make some confitional logic and to set some new property value
[09:39:57] <expando-> depending on it
[09:39:57] <seutje> when changing a data attribute?
[09:40:01] <seutje> or when getting it?
[09:40:24] <expando-> if(value == 'A') return 'X';
[09:40:30] <houman> Hi, If you have a simple div <div id="salesitems_modal" /> and want to empty it from any children, this is how I would do it right? $('#salesitems_modal').empty();  But it crashes in firebug. any idea why?
[09:40:37] <expando-> if(value == 'B') return 'Y';
[09:41:02] <expando-> in the event handler
[09:41:09] <expando-> on getData event
[09:41:40] <expando-> or at least to understand getData event
[09:41:47] <expando-> i have no real project goal
[09:42:00] <expando-> but i want better understanding of what i'm reading
[09:42:31] <expando-> and to hear the expert's voice
[09:42:40] <NoiseEee> houman: http://jsfiddle.net/eKXqp/ does not crash my FF
[09:43:23] <expando-> it is probably too specific problem because i was not able to find a practical example
[09:43:41] <expando-> using the value taken in getData
[09:43:58] <expando-> event handler
[09:44:47] <seutje> expando-: like http://jsfiddle.net/PYMTa/ ?
[09:46:21] <expando-> yes
[09:46:31] <expando-> it seems to be a workaround
[09:46:42] <expando-> i'll check if it works
[09:47:41] <callumacrae> I just starting updating my project to 1.8.1, and when called through both the CDN and locally (downloaded from jquery.com), it throws the following error: "Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: &#8592; previous"
[09:47:55] <callumacrae> The jQuery function still ends up defined, though
[09:47:59] <callumacrae> It throws the error immediately
[09:48:25] <seutje> expando-: you do that, I'm going to go have a burger, go home, maybe grab a drink and possibly smoke myself into the stratosphere
[09:48:40] <NoiseEee> callumacrae: and you're loading jquery twice because....
[09:48:40] <expando-> ok
[09:48:49] <expando-> thank you
[09:48:59] <seutje> NoiseEee: mo $$ mo problems!
[09:49:06] <ShooterMG> what's a good corners plugin that lets me specify images to use for the corners? ( i don't need a round-corners plugin)
[09:49:08] <NoiseEee> heh
[09:49:11] <Gho5t> nice
[09:49:25] <Gho5t> just do it your daymn self
[09:49:28] <expando-> if i have additional questions i'll come back. mIRC is not so wide used now in bulgaria and like to use it for something real valuable and interesting

[09:51:18] <Gho5t> shoutout to the moon too
[09:57:12] <expando-> i'm sorry for posting code here
[09:57:22] <expando-> myDiv.data('tvprogram'); - is my trigger
[09:57:52] <expando-> myDiv.bind('getData', function(evt, key) {
[09:57:52] <expando-> 		var $this = $(this);
[09:57:52] <expando-> 		var value = $this.attr('tvprogram');
[09:57:52] <expando-> 		alert('GET key: ' + key + ', value: ' + value);
[09:57:52] <expando-> 	});
[09:58:01] <expando-> is my evend handler
[09:58:18] <expando-> and my value still is undefined
[09:58:53] <expando-> jQuery version i set is 1.8.0
[09:59:02] <expando-> hosted by google
[09:59:21] <callumacrae> NoiseEee: No, I'm loading it once. I should probably have said "either"
[10:00:07] <expando-> it seems the problem is very tricky or i omit something
[10:00:29] <expando-> any ideas?
[10:01:46] <Gho5t> expando-: value = $this.attr('data-'+key);
[10:02:04] <Gho5t> e.g. value = $this.attr('data-tvprogram');
[10:02:04] <expando-> it was rewritten
[10:02:14] <expando-> ok
[10:03:34] <expando-> it still doesn't work for me
[10:03:41] <rgr> Whats the best way to say "if this doesnt contain an element of a certain class"? This doesnt seem to work : should it? '$(":not(.badges)",this).append('<div class="badges"></div>');'
[10:03:45] <bot-t> (20 hours 20 mins ago) <Eviltwin> tell rgr http://jsfiddle.net/Dg5pb/
[10:04:20] <Gho5t> expando-: fillde it
[10:05:09] <expando-> ?
[10:05:20] <Gho5t> jsfiddle.net
[10:05:22] <Gho5t> sorry
[10:05:23] <expando-> i don't understand you
[10:05:28] <expando-> i have never used it
[10:05:32] <Tun> ?
[10:05:41] <expando-> and supposed it will be too short
[10:05:51] <expando-> to solve the problem
[10:06:04] <expando-> i'll try to put it and post you a link
[10:07:01] <Gho5t> seutje	expando-: like http://jsfiddle.net/PYMTa/ ?
[10:07:06] <Gho5t> remember how he did it
[10:07:14] <Gho5t> jsfiddle allows you to manipulate it
[10:07:19] <Gho5t> create new versions, etc
[10:07:33] <expando-> http://jsfiddle.net/PYMTa/2/
[10:07:38] <expando-> can you see it?
[10:08:48] <expando-> i updated the source code
[10:09:01] <expando-> i think 'data' is no needed
[10:09:26] <expando->  var value = $this.attr('data-tvprogram');
[10:09:29] <expando-> in this row
[10:10:33] <expando-> but with or without 'data' it still doesn't work
[10:11:38] <Emn1ty> any reason why I can't take the data return from $.getJSON out of the scope of the function?
[10:13:11] <johnkpaul> ?ajax101 @Emn1ty
[10:13:12] <bot-t> Emn1ty, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[10:13:28] <johnkpaul> Emn1ty: the "return" happens before you have the data from the ajax call
[10:14:09] <Emn1ty> so basically, I have to write the stuff inside the function...
[10:14:22] <Emn1ty> but I am
[10:15:23] <Emn1ty> $.getJSON(url, function(data) {return data;});
[10:16:20] <expando-> what about my problem?
[10:16:34] <johnkpaul> Emn1ty: that function return value isn't used for anything, it happens after your other code has finished running
[10:17:20] <Emn1ty> johnkpual: I have a function which issues the request, which returns the data. I assumed that the code would wait for the function to return the value before continuing, am I wrong?
[10:18:55] <Gho5t> expando-: http://jsfiddle.net/PYMTa/6/
[10:19:23] <johnkpaul> yes, you are wrong
[10:19:30] <johnkpaul> the A in ajax is asynchronous
[10:19:39] <NodeX> lol
[10:19:54] <johnkpaul> all code that deals with your data needs to be in the sucess callback
[10:19:59] <johnkpaul> or some other abstraction for the success callback
[10:20:05] <johnkpaul> but it can't be returned
[10:21:02] <Gho5t> expando-: you were skipping checking jquery internally defined data
[10:21:03] <expando-> Gho5t, thank you, it is working now
[10:21:11] <Gho5t> and only checking the attribute data-tvprogram
[10:21:20] <Emn1ty> that makes little sense to me as to why that wouldn't be allowed, regardless of it being asynchronous. Isn't the point of javascript the ability to manipulate data post-rendering? anyways, seems like a stupid limitation to me.
[10:21:25] <Emn1ty> but whatever
[10:21:42] <expando-> http://jsfiddle.net/PYMTa/8/
[10:21:49] <expando-> it is working also
[10:22:21] <expando-> but if i use $.data(this, 'tvprogram')
[10:22:56] <expando-> isn't it better to avoid using at all getData handler
[10:23:40] <expando-> and to write my method and conditionally check myDiv.data('tvprogram'); directly?
[10:24:13] <expando-> indeed your idea is very good.
[10:25:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have a textarea in a dialog.... The newlines shows as <br> - How do I remove the <br> things from the textarea?
[10:25:47] <Gho5t> didn't i have the same exact thing
[10:26:05] <Gho5t> $.data(this, 'tvprogram') === jQuery.data(this, key);
[10:29:35] <expando-> yes you are right it is functionally equivalent and what you wrote is a workaround exactly what i asked. what confused me was according to my understanding of o'reilly cookbook if we write - function(evt, key, value) {} - all the three
[10:29:48] <expando-> values should be initialized
[10:29:50] <TelFiRE> Is there a way to identify what class the current element has, which starts with "nid-" ? I have id numbers and I want to match a link with a div it's supposed to open.which is elsewhere in the markup
[10:30:48] <expando-> my problem is solved. the source code was a little unintuitive for me but i'm still learning jquery
[10:30:57] <expando-> thank you very much again
[10:34:30] <wolfehr> is it possible to alter the number of columns in a UIDatepicker (only way to resize it seems to be to alter the font size)

[11:24:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have a jquery datepicker inside a modal dialog... but for some reason it's open by default...
[11:24:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> any idea?
[11:25:51] <bung> ecky--ptang-zoob: is the datepicker focused by default?
[11:25:59] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes
[11:26:08] <bung> and doesnt focusing a datepicker open it?
[11:26:36] <ecky--ptang-zoob> don't know what you mean
[11:27:12] <bung> this is the problem right? "but for some reason [the datepicker] is open by default"
[11:27:33] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes, it should open when clicking in the textbox
[11:27:48] <bung> is the cursor already in the textbox when the modal opens/
[11:28:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> if i do it on a normal page, it works... but in a modal dialog, it shows by default.. yes, the cursor is inside the textbox when opening the dialog
[11:28:26] <ecky--ptang-zoob> should i put the default elsewhere?
[11:28:33] <ecky--ptang-zoob> the focus i mean
[11:28:45] <bung> so when you put your cursor in a textbox it shows the datepicker
[11:28:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh yes, i get it now... it's normal :)
[11:29:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so what do i do about it?
[11:29:10] <bung> get it not to focus on there somehow
[11:29:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> how to change the focus,

[11:39:05] <bung> uSMS: while dragging? or after stop?
[11:39:33] <bung> ecky--ptang-zoob: there was another suggestion there
[11:39:42] <bung> attach the datepicker on open: instead of document.ready
[11:39:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes
[11:39:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tx
[11:40:14] <bung> you could focus on a visibility:hidden field too
[11:40:21] <bung> if you dont want people to see something above datepicker
[11:40:35] <bung> maybe that would work, dunno
[11:40:44] <ecky--ptang-zoob> a hidden textfield maybe+?
[11:40:56] <bung> i would try the datepicker on open first
[11:41:03] <bung> before trying to mess with focus on hidden elements
[11:41:10] <bung> but whatever you prefer
[11:41:18] <Oona_> hello
[11:41:26] <bung> i doubt you can focus on display:none, but maybe visibility:hidden... i dont know offhand
[11:42:10] <Oona_> can i get some help with jQuery?
[11:42:37] <bung> Oona_: rule #3 of the internet: don't ask to ask
[11:42:38] <ecky--ptang-zoob> solved it!
[11:42:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> open: function() { $('#hiddenfirst').hide(); },
[11:42:50] <uSMS> is there any way to tell what element a div is stopped over with draggable jquery?
[11:42:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> :p
[11:42:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> dirty way
[11:43:04] <bung> uSMS: while dragging? or after stop?
[11:43:12] <uSMS> after it stops
[11:43:24] <bung> youd have to write some position checking function
[11:43:28] <bung> between your div and all other divs
[11:43:29] <uSMS> i want it to copy the content of what was being dragged into the element it was stopped over
[11:45:07] <bung> uSMS: i ran across this last night doing some other stuff http://jsfiddle.net/gabrieleromanato/ptp3J/
[11:45:19] <bung> from this blog post: http://blog.gabrieleromanato.com/2012/06/jquery-snap-a-box-to-a-grid/
[11:45:45] <bung> thats a very position based way of doing it
[11:45:55] <bung> if you just have random content, you might have to write something like i said
[11:46:22] <bung> ecky--ptang-zoob: post to that stack overflow post then
[11:47:06] <Oona_> I want to check the top/bottom position of a div inside a parent div.
[11:47:25] <Oona_> the parent div hides the overflow of the 2nd div
[11:47:35] <uSMS> ok cool cool
[11:47:37] <bung> ? position @ Oona_
[11:47:38] <bot-t> Oona_, .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[11:47:38] <uSMS> im gunna check it out
[11:48:04] <Oona_> I'm too noob
[11:48:05] <bung> uSMS: might not do anything more than get the juices flowing
[11:48:25] <uSMS> cool, thanks for the help :)
[11:48:51] <Oona_> I have this so far: if ($(".control_wrapper ul").height() - $(".control_wrapper ul").scrollTop()  == $(".control_wrapper").height()) { alert ("bottom"); }
[11:48:59] <uSMS> wow that looks like its basically exactly what i was looking for bung!
[11:49:49] <bung> uSMS im not so sure
[11:50:13] <teskitoe> I want to do some work when I first load a page, but not when the user comes to the page via back/forward button. what's a good way to achieve that?
[11:50:39] <bung> teskitoe: maybe through one of those hashbang systems
[11:51:16] <teskitoe> bung, I was looking for some kind of document/window event. the user could navigate offsite as well
[11:51:50] <bung> yea i dont know if browsers tell you that info myself, i'd have to google
[11:51:55] <bung> beyond me
[11:52:11] <teskitoe> i tried, no luck so came here (maybe i'm not searching right)
[11:52:22] <Oona_> I have up/down button. If I push up, the sliderDiv goes down 120px. If the end is reached of the [height 100%] sliderDiv if want the button or animation to be disabled
[11:52:25] <teskitoe> hmm
[11:52:31] <bung> Oona_: alert( $(".control_wrapper ul").position().top );
[11:52:55] <Blaster> Hey guys, I'm trying to build a simple hover/slide down on vertical menu items, but for the life of me I can't make it so it isn't so damn buggy.  How can I make this thing operate smoothly and not do endless loops and crap when I scroll over it a bunch of times fast, etc?  Please have a look at my example here: http://jsfiddle.net/d3BHL/11/
[11:54:03] <bung> teskitoe: just generic "javascript back button detection"
[11:54:12] <bung> http://www.bajb.net/2010/02/browser-back-button-detection/
[11:55:00] <uSMS> bung: i havent actually tested this, but this is the basic idea i think:  http://jsfiddle.net/ptp3J/17/
[11:55:31] <wolfehr> any reason why i can't trigger onClose for a UIDatepicker?
[11:55:40] <bung> uSMS: strangely that doesnt drag for me
[11:55:42] <wolfehr> (as in $(elem).trigger('onClose');
[11:56:03] <teskitoe> bung, that would only work on the page that sends me to my page. once the user arrives at my page my scripts would be re-initialized
[11:56:11] <uSMS> me either. it's a bug in jsfiddle I found earlier. I'm going to try it on my actual site
[11:56:12] <teskitoe> *that sends users to my page
[11:56:43] <bung> hmm, can i ask then what sort of scripts youre running, maybe you could use a cookie or something to tell if youve run something already
[11:56:44] <wolfehr> ah, I need to hide it to trigger onClose....
[11:57:05] <bung> i mean testing the back/forward sounds like maybe youre going down the wrong path (even though i have no idea what youre doing)
[11:57:48] <bung> Blaster: just get an accordion plugin to do that for ya m8
[11:58:01] <bung> Blaster: http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[11:59:03] <Blaster> thanks I will try it
[12:02:04] <bung> Blaster: i say that but you may not want to deny yourself the experience/practice of writing an accordion yourself
[12:02:11] <bung> i think thats a really good exersize
[12:02:13] <teskitoe> bung, i'm binding model to a view... however sometimes the user will fill out a form, navigate somewhere else (or submit with an error) and decide to come back but the model binding will reset the form data. iif i can detect if the user came here via back buttno then i won't need to reset the form
[12:03:06] <teskitoe> bung, there are a few ways, for example when the user hits back button the page doesn't request the server to fetch js/css assets again so i could just check something like that
[12:03:21] <bung> can you serialize the form, stuff it in a cookie before sending them off... then just check when they coe back for the cookie
[12:03:57] <bung> "when they come back" "on page load"
[12:04:04] <teskitoe> bung, but i'm sure there has to be a more tried and tested approach... since there are a lot of mvc/js apps out there
[12:04:20] <bung> youll probly have to post on SO
[12:04:38] <teskitoe> bung, yeah that's what i'll probably do
[12:04:40] <bung> ive been answering simpler questions for an hour here and dont see the usual advanced guys around
[12:04:51] <bung> :)
[12:05:02] <teskitoe> bung, i'm not that advanced =) just have a tricky problem, that's all
[12:05:12] <bung> yea cool
[12:09:02] <Absolute0> Why am I getting a 'Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'animate'' error here: http://pastie.org/4681509?
[12:12:44] <bung> Absolute0: try just before that line in your code: console.log( $('#username_help').length) );
[12:12:48] <bung> see if its zero or not
[12:13:06] <Absolute0> no it exists..
[12:13:36] <bung> could you whip up a more working example on jsfiddle then?
[12:13:37] <Absolute0> 1
[12:13:47] <bung> doesnt hover take functions?
[12:13:56] <bung> ? hover @ bung
[12:13:56] <bot-t> bung, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[12:13:57] <Absolute0> slideDown, slideUp ..
[12:14:55] <Absolute0> well that fixes it..
[12:14:57] <Absolute0> weird
[12:15:09] <bung> .hover( function(){ $(this).slideUp(); },...
[12:15:12] <bung> what fixed it?
[12:15:19] <Absolute0> what you just did
[12:15:32] <bung> ah ok cool
[12:15:37] <bung> must just be the way hover does its business
[12:15:53] <Absolute0> thanks!
[12:15:56] <bung> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.7.2&fn=jQuery.fn.hover
[12:15:57] <Absolute0> w
[12:16:03] <bung> very handy link that viewer
[12:16:17] <bung> i guess that goes down a ways
[12:16:24] <bung> maybe tl;dr :)
[12:18:52] <TelFiRE> I don't understand, my $(document).click(function(){}); is not working on mobile.. it is supposed to isn't it? Any debugging tips?
[12:20:39] <bung> TelFiRE: you already using jquery mobile or just jquery
[12:27:27] <zeromodulus> is there a way to combine CSS selectors with JS `this`?
[12:27:37] <zeromodulus> e.g. "this > ul"
[12:28:12] <zeromodulus> or I guess I should use something like $(this).select("> ul")?
[12:28:28] <ejcweb> I want to modify the action attribute of all form elements. $('form').attr('action', '/newurl') works, but is there a way to make this work for all subsequently created <form> elements?
[12:28:48] <ejcweb> Or to capture the submit event of all form elements and change the action attribute there?
[12:32:19] <Oona_> I have example: http://jsfiddle.net/e4mBF/2/
[12:32:31] <Oona_> jquery doesn't seems to work..
[12:33:03] <hlve> hey guys, how would I take this jsfiddle example I found on Google, and update it to remove the map, and output the City/State to the appropriate fields?
[12:33:03] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/QWPCL/101/
[12:33:27] <Eviltwin> *sigh*
[12:33:35] <Eviltwin> Oona_: jQuery's working just fine, you need to learn how to CSS: http://jsfiddle.net/e4mBF/3/
[12:34:16] <Oona_> please tell what i did wrong
[12:34:28] <zeromodulus> what is this selector symbol called? <
[12:34:37] <zeromodulus> I'm reading on CSS tricks that it isn't a parent selector.
[12:34:44] <zeromodulus> so is there another name for it?
[12:35:16] <Zzaichik> Oona_: what's with the += and -= for CSS?
[12:37:16] <hlve> hey guys, how would I take this jsfiddle example I found on Google, and update it to remove the map, and output the City/State to the appropriate fields?
[12:37:23] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/QWPCL/101/
[12:37:26] <hlve> :O
[12:37:46] <Oona_> the += and -= is to make the div go up and down?
[12:38:10] <Eviltwin> Oona_: Open http://jsfiddle.net/e4mBF/3/ and look for the change
[12:38:27] <Oona_> i saw, relative rule ;)
[12:39:00] <Oona_> now, my question.. i don't want the vertical slider go further then it's top and bottom
[12:43:21] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: got the drag and drop working in iframes when they are created from the parent doc. I still have to work out a couple of edge cases, as well as the offset when scrolling with a drag, but it's getting there :) http://jsfiddle.net/jscheel/htGGf/
[12:43:29] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: thanks again for your help yesterday
[12:43:38] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: no problem
[12:43:46] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: Glad you got it working.
[12:44:33] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: it's definitely a bastardization of all that is holy, but I think it's gonna work. Now I have to figure out how to start a drag from the parent, and be able to drag it into the iframe and continue the drag
[12:44:35] <jscheel> fun
[12:45:09] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: Yeah, that part sounds tricky.
[12:45:32] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: Have you seen the cross-window bouncing balls demo?
[12:46:02] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: the chrome experiment?
[12:46:07] <scott_gonzalez> jscheel: yeah
[12:46:15] <haizum> i'm having an issue with the $.each function
[12:46:18] <haizum> here's my code
[12:46:19] <haizum> http://jsfiddle.net/gMsvP/
[12:46:24] <jscheel> scott_gonzalez: yeah, but I haven't looked thru the code, good place to start
[12:46:46] <haizum> it's not iterating through my array properly, its inserting the LAST value of the array ("19"), rather than each value in order
[12:48:13] <Oona_> anyone know what i mean?
[12:49:05] <NoiseEee> haizum: its doing it faster than you can see
[12:49:21] <NoiseEee> haizum: you're setting the text() of an element 19 times.
[12:50:12] <rogeruiz> oona_: so essentially the prev and next buttons don't push the slider beyond it's limits?
[12:50:37] <Oona_> yeah that is what i'm trying to do
[12:50:47] <Oona_> but dont know exactly how
[12:50:54] <rogeruiz> is this an infinite slider?
[12:51:12] <rogeruiz> so if the user is at the last slide, it goes back to the first one?
[12:51:15] <rogeruiz> well i'm guess not
[12:51:17] <rogeruiz> silly question
[12:51:24] <rogeruiz> it hits the end and ends
[12:51:58] <Oona_> no... but a slider which the height is always 100%, so i can add more items if i want
[12:52:14] <rogeruiz> oona_ the simplest way is to `return` early when the prev and next are clicked based on the the index (position) of the slide
[12:52:57] <rogeruiz> `$('.slide').index()`
[12:53:27] <rogeruiz> would return the position. if that's equal to $('.slide').length - 1 then you don't go beyond that
[12:53:29] <Oona_> ehm
[12:53:40] <rogeruiz> if you can get something on jsfiddle, i can help you out
[12:53:49] <Oona_> yep, moment
[12:53:58] <Oona_> http://jsfiddle.net/e4mBF/3/
[12:55:42] <hlve> shoky. i need your help. you're my favorite jquery wizard.
[12:56:55] <void> Hello
[12:57:22] <haizum> NoiseEee: ok so i need it to just set the text once, and in order of the array
[12:57:22] <void> what is a correct way to understand whether some object is jQuery or not?
[12:57:55] <NoiseEee> haizum: i don't understand what you want.  all those numbers to be listed in a <div> or similar element?
[12:58:19] <LessSeen> haizum you might want to make a complete, working jsfiddle
[12:58:40] <haizum> NoiseEee: inside the <span> there is text, i want the text to be the value of the array
[12:58:51] <haizum> ie, mytext1, mytext2
[12:59:06] <haizum> right now the array is just numbers
[12:59:13] <haizum> which is fine for testing purposes
[12:59:20] <haizum> eventually i will make them all unique
[12:59:37] <haizum> i just need the $.each function to apply the text to each of the elements in the order of the array
[12:59:56] <haizum> according to jquery documentation, my code should work
[13:00:00] <void> should I check for myobj instanceof jQuery ? or check for some attribute, like myobj.find !== undefined ?
[13:00:03] <LessSeen> also browsers sometimes order json differently in my experience
[13:00:04] <haizum> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[13:00:07] <haizum> look at the last example
[13:00:10] <haizum> my code is the exact same
[13:00:32] <NoiseEee> haizum: you're setting text()  each time,  and overwriting every time previous.
[13:00:41] <NoiseEee> haizum: http://jsfiddle.net/gMsvP/1/
[13:00:51] <haizum> why does the example on jquery docs work
[13:00:59] <haizum> like i said, my code is the same
[13:01:25] <Oona_> howto get <name> to point some text to someone?
[13:02:23] <zeromodulus> is there a way to select within a jQuery object?
[13:02:32] <NoiseEee> haizum: http://jsfiddle.net/gMsvP/2/
[13:02:33] <haizum> NoiseEee: what's the point of using join?
[13:02:43] <zeromodulus> e.g. `$(this).select("thing")`
[13:02:57] <void> zeromodulus: .find() or .filter()
[13:03:11] <zeromodulus> thanks.
[13:04:01] <NoiseEee> haizum: based on what you said your requirements were ;)   but a) your example "is not identical to the jquery docs"  and b) you were OVERWRITING the text() of your element 19 times
[13:04:27] <haizum> NoiseEee: yes it is identical
[13:04:32] <haizum> NoiseEee: how is it not?
[13:05:04] <void> Oona_: usually start typing someone's name and then press tab
[13:05:05] <haizum> NoiseEee: the jquery example uses an array just like mine, and is using the .text function to apply the value, and its doing it in order without overwriting the last value, as you can see in the demo output
[13:05:31] <NoiseEee> haizum: because the element it is writing to via text() changes each time.
[13:05:34] <NoiseEee> its dynamic.
[13:05:42] <NoiseEee> ("#" + this).text() <---
[13:06:26] <haizum> NoiseEee: ah. so if i were to use .wrap for instance, i could insert the span with the unique array item?
[13:06:41] <haizum> let me try
[13:07:20] <firstclassfunc> how do I find all the radio button groups inside of a div?
[13:07:28] <callumacrae> is $('p').find('.test') the same as $('p .test') or $('p:first .test')?
[13:07:47] <rogeruiz> Oona_ http://jsfiddle.net/e4mBF/4/
[13:07:49] <rogeruiz> that should do it
[13:07:57] <NoiseEee> callumacrae: the latter would only return .test classes from the first p element
[13:08:05] <rogeruiz> some simple checks of the container, and keeping track of the position
[13:08:22] <Oona_> let me see..
[13:08:23] <callumacrae> NoiseEee: Yes.
[13:08:26] <zeromodulus> any ideas why this doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/r6pDh/
[13:08:27] <rogeruiz> http://jsfiddle.net/e4mBF/5/
[13:08:28] <Oona_> Great!
[13:08:30] <rogeruiz> cleaned up a bit
[13:09:05] <Oona_> ow thank you! Let me study the code...
[13:10:01] <rogeruiz> sure thing, oona_ glad I could help
[13:10:42] <Oona_> just curious, what happens with the fiddle?
[13:11:01] <p3rtutt1> could you guys give a like to this page: https://www.facebook.com/AtoalhadosTexteisPt , please?
[13:11:16] <bung> ./kick p3rtutt1
[13:13:03] <haizum> NoiseEee: do you know how i can achieve what it is i'm trying to do?
[13:14:15] <NoiseEee> haizum: perhaps you should ADD to the element you want to send text() to instead of rewriting it every time.
[13:14:15] <klawd_prime> modpr/part
[13:14:25] <rogeruiz> oona_? what do you mean?
[13:14:28] <NoiseEee> haizum: or build a string/etc out of your array and THEN update the element
[13:14:32] <dogarrhea2> is there a known issue where ie8 cookies are randomly dropped?
[13:14:48] <Gho5t> no
[13:14:51] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: There's a known issue where IE is terrible
[13:14:54] <Gho5t> yes
[13:14:59] <dogarrhea2> well besides that
[13:15:08] <firstclassfunc> how do I find all the radio button groups inside of a div?
[13:15:11] <Gho5t> there is a known issue where sessions time out
[13:15:18] <Gho5t> which is probaaaably what's happening
[13:15:18] <TrentonDAdams> Isn't IE always terrible?
[13:15:27] <Eviltwin> firstclassfunc: $("#mydiv input[type=radio]")
[13:15:33] <dogarrhea2> Gho5t: can you link me the bug report?
[13:15:46] <Gho5t> sorry i was making fun
[13:15:51] <Gho5t> e.g. are you sure your session isn't timing out
[13:16:27] <firstclassfunc> Eviltwin: that gives me an object, but I don't know how to operate on it
[13:16:42] <Eviltwin> firstclassfunc: Have you ever used jQuery before?
[13:17:02] <firstclassfunc> Eviltwin: yes, not extensively. I can use it to get the name of 1 radio group, but more than 1 and I can't figure it out
[13:17:20] <Gho5t> that does give you more than one
[13:17:27] <Gho5t> it gives you all that is found in that div
[13:17:50] <firstclassfunc> http://pastebin.com/VHjFK4kE -- this is what I'm trying to no avail
[13:18:28] <Eviltwin> firstclassfunc: jQuery collections are actually array-like
[13:18:37] <firstclassfunc> I know it's wrong and can see a lot of nested objects returned when I print it
[13:18:39] <Eviltwin> Meaning they have a .length and keys 0, 1, ... .length-1
[13:18:54] <Eviltwin> So do for(var i = 0; i < radios.length; i++) { radios[i]
[13:19:11] <Eviltwin> Or see ?.each and maybe see ?.map
[13:19:33] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/each/ http://api.jquery.com/map/
[13:19:41] <dogarrhea2> Gho5t: how do you find out if your session has timed out
[13:19:58] <dogarrhea2> seems like if there is a bug, you wouldn't really have any explicit way of finding out
[13:20:33] <dogarrhea2> i can watch cookie values and such, but what's to say it's not something else if suddenly the cookie values are null
[13:20:40] <firstclassfunc> Eviltwin: I did use a for loop to go through it.. I just get a bunch of junk with it too
[13:20:45] <dogarrhea2> basically, how do you know if it's an IE bug
[13:21:02] <Eviltwin> firstclassfunc: You seem really new to this
[13:21:19] <Eviltwin> I suggest you read through this: http://jqfundamentals.com
[13:22:39] <firstclassfunc> radios[i] gives me something. I want it's name. radios[i].attr('name') is an error
[13:23:01] <Eviltwin> That's because radio[i] is not a jQuery collection
[13:23:10] <Eviltwin> It's a DOM element
[13:23:35] <Eviltwin> To use jQuery methods you need to do $(radios[i])
[13:24:10] <hlve> guys. why does this work in chrome,firefox, but not in IE?
[13:24:10] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/FkZup/1/
[13:24:22] <hlve> (type zip code, it auto completes city/state/country.)
[13:24:32] <hlve> No errors in debugger in IE, either.
[13:24:36] <firstclassfunc> Eviltwin: thanks. I am new to jquery/js in general
[13:25:37] <hlve> Any ideas guys?
[13:25:58] <t432> this function should return the "count" but returns null - http://pastebin.com/BcZCjKA1
[13:26:03] <Eviltwin> hlve: If you throw a steaming pile of code at us, try to give us more than 60 seconds to read it
[13:26:21] <hlve> lol sorry
[13:26:34] <t432> for example when call this function from another function and use console to print value, i see null
[13:27:19] <t432> it is syntactically correct, right?
[13:27:31] <Eviltwin> hlve: So you can't narrow this down to anything more specific that's not working?
[13:27:46] <Eviltwin> All of this code needs to be here for it to work in Chrome and Firefox but not IE
[13:28:00] <NoiseEee> ?ajax101
[13:28:07] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: It seems to be gone
[13:28:15] <hlve> well, I know that when I type a zip on any other browser, it autocompletes city/state/zip.
[13:28:27] <hlve> I'm thinking it must have something to do with the             ele.on('input change', function() {
[13:28:36] <hlve> but I don't know of any IE9 incompatibility with that
[13:28:38] <Eviltwin> t432, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[13:28:39] <t432> anyone
[13:28:50] <NoiseEee> beauty
[13:29:00] <Eviltwin> t432: Please see those links
[13:29:02] <dogarrhea2> oh
[13:29:08] <dogarrhea2> i think i may have a cookie overflow
[13:29:17] <dogarrhea2> what are the limits on cookies in chrome?
[13:29:25] <hlve> :|
[13:29:33] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: How many are you trying to set?
[13:29:58] <Eviltwin> hlve: Why is it .on('input change' ?
[13:30:07] <dogarrhea2> i think less than 20 more than 10. i have to see this again
[13:30:08] <Eviltwin> I think you might want .on('keyup change'
[13:30:22] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: I know some browsers limit you to 15 or 16
[13:30:24] <dogarrhea2> the cookie is lost every so often, but not all the time
[13:30:37] <Eviltwin> Expiration?
[13:30:57] <dogarrhea2> 24 hours
[13:31:33] <dogarrhea2> so you need over 4096 bytes in a cookie and Ie drops (not truncates)
[13:31:38] <hlve> keyup change didn't fix it.
[13:31:39] <hlve> hmph
[13:31:45] <dogarrhea2> i'm thinking it might be trying to store a super long string somewhere
[13:32:44] <dogarrhea2> " If the computer does not have sufficient space to store the cookie, the cookie is discarded. It is not truncated. Applications should use as few cookies as possible and as small a cookie as possible. Additionally, applications should be able to handle the loss of a cookie."
[13:34:53] <t432> Eviltwin: so return statement with ajax is not possible for what i ma trying to do? e.g. use ajax return value as conditional to run a function?
[13:35:17] <Eviltwin> Correct, it needs to be done using the callback pattern
[13:35:57] <shoky> hlve: the key event is not the problem
[13:36:06] <t432> i see
[13:36:35] <dogarrhea2> bah i almost thought i had the issue
[13:36:52] <hlve> shoky, just noticed it wasn't because if I alert on input change, it does alert.
[13:36:57] <hlve> :\
[13:37:12] <shoky> hlve: the ajax request is failing
[13:37:22] <shoky> with 'No Transport'
[13:37:24] <hlve> Any reason why the ajax would fail on IE and not firefox?
[13:37:28] <shoky> donno
[13:37:30] <hlve> :\
[13:37:37] <hlve> Bleh. Hmm.
[13:37:56] <Eviltwin> hlve: Try using a relative URL
[13:40:04] <hlve> Stupid question, how would I go about doing that? lol
[13:41:18] <hlve> and if this isn't going to work, what are some alternative solutions to achieve what I'm trying to do?
[13:41:35] <hlve> i've googled, and googled, and this solution was almost perfect: |
[13:45:21] <bigLanky> i am looking for a jquery carousel that will allow me to have 5 items, all 5 are visible.. clicking the left/right arrows will shift all items 1 position and i need something that adds an active class
[13:46:07] <bigLanky> i am currently using jcarousel, but it doesn't add a class for active on anything. it doesn't even use the same elements. when you get to the 5th item and it goes to load the first item again, it simply makes it #6 instead of #1 so it will keep adding <li> elements
[13:51:21] <haizum> using $.each, how can i take only one value from the given array, in order, rather than all of them?
[13:51:34] <haizum> like so that each subsequent call increases by + 1
[13:51:36] <Pilate> why would you use each if you only need one value
[13:51:48] <haizum> i need them all, but one at a time, in order
[13:51:51] <haizum> for each item
[13:51:59] <Eviltwin> What?
[13:52:02] <Pilate> ^
[13:52:19] <haizum> grr, why is this so hard for people to get
[13:52:21] <Eviltwin> $.each(["a", "b", "c"], function(index, element) { console.log(element); });
[13:52:28] <Eviltwin> Will give "a" then "b" then "c"
[13:52:39] <zeromodulus> why doesn't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/T73FF/2/
[13:52:57] <haizum> Eviltwin: yes, but its overwriting every last one when i use .text for example
[13:53:20] <Eviltwin> zeromodulus: The only property of a jQuery object that should be used without ()s is .length
[13:53:21] <haizum> i need it to take the first item, stop, then the next one takes the second item, etc.
[13:53:32] <Eviltwin> .parent is a function, not a property
[13:53:32] <b-ot> Eviltwin, memorised “parent”.
[13:53:43] <NoiseEee> <nelson laugh>
[13:53:46] <zeromodulus> oh, oops.
[13:53:54] * zeromodulus is used to ruby style.
[13:54:07] <zeromodulus> yay!
[13:54:09] <zeromodulus> n.n
[13:54:14] <zeromodulus> thanks.
[13:55:39] <NoiseEee> haizum: everything you need to understand is in http://jsfiddle.net/gMsvP/3/
[13:55:58] <NoiseEee> haizum: all signs point to a logic/thinking error, no offense
[13:56:59] <zeromodulus> how do I make it so the menu doesn't hide when the user mouses over the sub-menu?
[13:57:30] <hlve> shoky, do you think it could be resolved using JSONP? And how would I achieve converting it from JSON to JSONP
[13:57:47] <shoky> hlve: it could be resolved using JSONP only if ziptastic provide a JSONP api
[13:57:56] <shoky> and it doesn't seem that they do
[13:58:30] <hlve> dang. :|
[13:58:49] <hlve> Do you know of any alternative solutions for what I'm trying to do here? I've googled and googled, and never found any working alternatives.
[13:59:01] <shoky> hlve: your own server-side component
[14:00:09] <shoky> or do you mean an alternative to ziptastic
[14:00:19] <shoky> coz then, no idea
[14:01:09] <haizum> NoiseEee: thing is, i have 19 different div's, not just one. each div has to have a span inside which holds a unique text value which is contained within my array
[14:01:25] <haizum> NoiseEee: it's slightly more complicated than you perceive
[14:02:05] <hlve> hmph.
[14:02:19] <hlve> i wish i could localize what they have in place... on our box.
[14:02:20] <hlve> :|
[14:02:25] <shoky> can't you?
[14:02:29] <hlve> how would I?
[14:02:42] <NoiseEee> haizum: try making a test case that ACTUALLY resembles wtf you're trying to do.
[14:02:55] <shoky> i dunno find some list/db of US zipcodes. how big can it be, a few MB?
[14:03:36] * tw2113 tries to start a rumor that zip codes are going to run out in the next couple years
[14:04:25] <haizum> NoiseEee: i just explained it
[14:04:38] <shoky> haizum: not really
[14:05:03] <haizum> how so?
[14:05:15] <shoky> what is the problem..?
[14:05:27] <tw2113> we're running out of zip codes
[14:05:32] <shoky> what?!
[14:05:35] <haizum> ^^
[14:05:37] <tw2113> it'll be pandemonium shoky
[14:05:40] <NoiseEee> haizum: so somewhere in your loop, define the <div> you want to update.
[14:05:41] <shoky> i need to stock up
[14:05:58] <callumacrae> tw2113: rofl
[14:06:04] <tw2113> Walmart has them on sale, $9.99/ea
[14:06:09] <callumacrae> These jQuery folks are gullible
[14:06:23] <hlve> lol
[14:06:28] <callumacrae> First "jQuery is good for changing the HTML of elements", and now zip codes are running out!
[14:06:34] <callumacrae> (I'm not a troll, that was sarcastic)
[14:07:03] <tw2113> being sarcastic on irc should be called gnoming
[14:07:30] <haizum> NoiseEee: i did, but i still have the same issue, it's creating 19 different spans rather than one, because its going through the ENTIRE array for each div, instead of in logical order
[14:07:58] <haizum> so 19x19
[14:08:49] <haizum> the first .text or .append or .html or whatever i do needs to only grab the first value from the array, then the next time its called (on the following child div), needs to be 2nd, 3rd, etc.
[14:08:50] <haizum> get it?
[14:09:23] <tw2113> what's the latest fiddle for haizum
[14:09:48] <hlve> :(
[14:09:53] <shoky> :(
[14:09:56] <hlve> this is meant to never work.
[14:10:09] <NoiseEee> haizum: good luck.  you should be able to do what you need.
[14:10:13] <NoiseEee> haizum: http://jsfiddle.net/gMsvP/4/
[14:10:18] <hlve> it works so beautifully in firefox/chrome, which sucks the most out of all this.
[14:10:23] <haizum> http://jsfiddle.net/gMsvP/
[14:10:24] <hlve> shoky, how have you been, haven't bugged you in awhile
[14:11:37] <hlve> wait though. it can't be a cross-site scripting issue...
[14:11:45] <shoky> hlve, im ok, i mostly want to sleep
[14:11:47] <shoky> hows you
[14:12:04] <tw2113> why can't you sleep shoky ?
[14:12:09] <shoky> i can
[14:12:42] <shoky> i meant uhh generally
[14:13:21] <shoky> lets talk about zipcodes
[14:13:33] <hlve> lol
[14:13:36] <hlve> http://daspecster.github.com/ziptastic/demo.html
[14:13:43] <shoky> yep
[14:13:50] <hlve> well i guess it could still be a cross site scripting issue
[14:14:03] <pdtpatrick> Question - i've got the following validator: https://gist.github.com/11f0daf13ab296575229, my form looks like: http://cl.ly/image/1I0X2V1c1X0z  . Output looks like: http://cl.ly/image/2r2Q0L0W2o0R   .How can I tell jquery to prepend the add-on span rather than create a label?
[14:14:12] <hlve> cause IE doesn't work there either, but it's calling zip.elevenbasetwo
[14:14:35] <shoky> hlve their site is responding with: Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*
[14:14:41] <shoky> which IE9 doesn't support
[14:14:52] <hlve> Ah. are we on to something?
[14:14:54] <EyePulp> trying to figure out some regex --- I've got a line like this in a bunch of text files:       var id = "FOO";     and I want to grab FOO out. I can't seem to get a simple pattern working.  I've tried /^    var id \=\"([a-z0-9]{1,6})\";/i   but no luck.  any ideas?
[14:14:55] <shoky> nope..
[14:15:04] <shoky> except that IE sucks, that is
[14:15:27] <shoky> hlve if their site wouldn't have responded with that, it wouldnt have worked in chrome/ff either
[14:15:30] <haizum> NoiseEee: your code is only grabbing the first value in the array for every span
[14:15:58] <haizum> NoiseEee: i've written similar code and had the same issue. it needs to increase by + 1 each time, i've been saying that all alongh
[14:16:01] <shoky> a different one in each span..
[14:16:05] <hlve> Hmph
[14:16:05] <NoiseEee> haizum: the code is iterating through the *entire* array and creating a span for each one.
[14:16:30] <hlve> would there be any way to change the json call to use ajax instead?
[14:16:37] <NoiseEee> haizum: again, you might think you're actually explaining your issue, but you're not.  and clearly either you don't grasp what .each does, or you'd be able to make many of my suggestions work for your case.  good luck.
[14:16:42] <shoky> hlve: there's no such thing as a json call
[14:16:44] <shoky> it's already ajax.
[14:16:51] * hlve is new to ajax.
[14:16:52] <haizum> NoiseEee: not my fault you're a simpleton
[14:17:13] <shoky> hlve: any request you send from javascript that isn't a redirect is ajax
[14:18:11] <NoiseEee> haizum: yes, yes it is your fault that i'm a simpleton.  thanks for coming out.  good luck with the PQ.
[14:18:47] <hlve> Hmph. This damn thing.
[14:18:48] <hlve> :(
[14:18:58] <tw2113> haizum, i see 1-19 in NoiseEee's version
[14:19:17] <haizum> tw2113: i just tested. it's using the first value in the array as the .text inside each span
[14:19:35] <shoky> haizum you're clearly wrong about that, because all 19 values are there
[14:19:39] <shoky> not just the first.
[14:20:06] <tw2113> <div class="whatever"><span>18</span></div><div class="whatever"><span>19</span></div>
[14:20:25] <tw2113> though it does provide an empty one at the end
[14:21:25] <haizum> hmm not here
[14:21:30] <kkuno> hi
[14:21:33] <haizum> mine's showing one in every span
[14:21:40] <shoky> one of the 19, yes.......
[14:21:46] <haizum> no "one"
[14:21:53] <NoiseEee> haizum: thats what the fiddle is there for, you know... to see the code and adjust YOURS to make it work
[14:22:10] <kkuno> I need to make the browser download built with a jquery script
[14:22:21] <kkuno> any ideas?
[14:22:27] <kkuno> sorry
[14:22:33] <tw2113> ah i know
[14:22:35] <kkuno> I need to make the browser download a file built with a jquery script
[14:22:40] <tw2113> you have 20 div.whatever's
[14:23:28] <zeromodulus> I have a ul full of links that is hidden, when it's parent link is hovered, it slides down, but when I try to click a link in the sub links, I can't, because it immediately slides back up, I tried adding a mouseover for the sub links so that it will show as long as they are moused over, but that doesn't appear to work. ideas?
[14:23:51] <shoky> zeromodulus: try mouseenter/mouseleave
[14:24:02] <zeromodulus> k, thanks.
[14:24:25] <zeromodulus> that doesn't appear to work either.
[14:24:39] <shoky> on the "parent link", i guess
[14:25:04] <zeromodulus> nope.
[14:25:12] <shoky> fiddle..
[14:25:22] <zeromodulus> I be fiddlin'
[14:25:30] <tw2113> everyday i'm fiddlin'
[14:35:46] <Gambit-> void, so what was the usage that used the $(this) to get the form parameters?
[14:36:09] <callumacrae> .serialize()? I'm not really sure hwat you're asking xD
[14:36:09] <b-ot> callumacrae, no YOU'RE asking xD
[14:36:18] * callumacrae blinks
[14:36:22] <DrShoggoth> is there a better way to build dom elements than append() ?
[14:36:29] <DrShoggoth> its driving me bonkers :(
[14:36:42] <callumacrae> DrShoggoth: What's wrong with it?
[14:36:52] <callumacrae> Try the pure JS method, then you'll LOVE .append()
[14:37:01] <void> DrShoggoth: you can always use document.createElement
[14:37:17] <void> Gambit-: this in that case is your button.
[14:37:38] <DrShoggoth> sometimes it tries to complete tags for me,  sometimes it puts things inside tags that are already closed
[14:37:42] <Gambit-> when called using which method to hook?
[14:37:43] <void> Gambit-: usually you set button handlers with $(selector).click(function(){
[14:37:54] <DrShoggoth> i feel like i'm losing my mind
[14:38:02] <Gambit-> ahh
[14:38:24] <Gambit-> what was the snippet to go up a level again? Do you mind jsfiddleing?
[14:40:08] <DrShoggoth> i see what i'm doing
[14:41:10] <DrShoggoth> looks like after() is good
[14:50:20] <AngryAsian> Hey guys, how can I condense this / make it better / faster / shinier?       $(image).parent().parent().parent().parent().find('div.post_gallery_main img').
[14:51:01] <Zzaichik> haha that's awesome.
[14:52:14] <pdtpatrick> Question - I'm using validator plugin. However, when I tab, the error still remains until I refresh the page. However, if I delete text in the field, it detects that and shows the error. Here's my code: http://pastie.org/private/3w8erzx5jl0jggos6oba
[14:58:30] <sunbeam> hi, a question. the default facebook like code, with which I can click to like a web site domain opens a popup
[14:58:34] <sunbeam> How can I avoid this? Because most people block pop ups
[14:58:34] <sunbeam> Is there a way to like a certain facebook page instead of a site?
[14:59:13] <Eviltwin> Not really a jQuery question is it?
[15:01:04] <Gambit-> what's the easiest way of simulating a mouse click on all elements on a page?
[15:01:12] <Eviltwin> Gambit-: *all* elements?
[15:01:26] <Gambit-> of a specific class, yeah
[15:01:33] <Eviltwin> ...why?
[15:01:55] <Gambit-> heh
[15:02:01] <Gambit-> mostly just playing around
[15:02:09] <Eviltwin> $(".classname").click()
[15:02:14] <jamesaa> I'm new to jquery so sorry if this is a simple question I want to do a .load() on click and undo that when clicked again. Would I use .toggle()? what do you suggest?
[15:17:43] <JayNeely> I'm trying to build a Chrome content script extension (modifies the DOM of pages). I have some $(document).ready() code working fine, but the same code in $(document).ajaxStop() never seems to get fired.
[15:17:58] <JayNeely> I know AJAX calls are being completed as I can see the new content loading on the page + XHR finished loading messages in the console. Any ideas?
[15:18:40] <JayNeely> code link: http://jsfiddle.net/RTjVe/
[15:22:05] <JayNeely> Are there any other events I could use to detect new content appearing in a div on the page other than ajaxStop?
[15:24:54] <kkuno> someone know if it is possible to force downloading a file from client
[15:25:04] <kkuno> rather then directly download it from server?
[15:38:05] <Gambit-> how do I keep jQuery from assigning the $ variable?
[15:41:58] <MistuhKurtz> Gambit-, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[15:42:12] <MistuhKurtz> just call jQuery.noConflict(); before any other js code
[15:42:30] <MistuhKurtz> if you want to use the $ variable in your jquery code, but you want to scope it so that it doesn't affect other libraries, you can do
[15:42:40] <MistuhKurtz> jQuery(document).ready(function($){ ... });
[15:43:10] <MistuhKurtz> or you can pass whatever you want as the argument in for that anonymous function, and it will become an alias for jQuery
[15:43:17] <Gambit-> hm, does that somehow magically reset the $ value back to what it was before the <script> command loaded the jquery.js file
[15:43:18] <Gambit-> ?
[15:43:35] <JayNeely> It looks like DOMNodeInserted captures the event of new content being loaded in, but I can't figure out how to reference that content.
[15:44:46] <MistuhKurtz> yes Gambit-
[15:45:41] <MistuhKurtz> if $ is already defined, then it saves it as $_, and if you call noConflict(), then it resets $ to what it was originally.
[15:46:09] <Gambit-> ahh nifty
[16:28:22] <rebekah> Hi
[16:30:39] <SolarBoom1> <<
[16:31:45] <rebekah> I was steered in this direction, by some colleagues of mine.
[16:32:01] <rebekah> This is my first time in such an environment.
[16:32:22] <rebekah> I am sort of a novice in regards to Javascript...
[16:32:25] <LessSeen> congrats!
[16:32:46] <LessSeen> welcome to the wonderful land of inturweb relay chattering
[16:32:54] <sahbeewah> once you come in... you may never come out
[16:32:56] <rebekah> but being interested and and loving testing with Rspec... Thanks.
[16:33:24] <rebekah> I have attempted to add jasmine testing for our Rails app
[16:33:45] <rebekah> I am using the jasmine-jquery extension
[16:33:58] <rebekah> and I am trying to test jquery
[16:34:14] <rebekah> in our Rails app
[16:34:34] <rebekah> is there anyone here that knows anything about that?
[16:35:45] <rebekah> I have the javascript testing working properly, and the HTML and CSS fixtures are being loaded.
[16:36:17] <rebekah> but I am not able to either make the event occur or update the DOM properly
[16:36:27] <rebekah> not sure where the breakdown is
[16:36:58] <rebekah> but basically I am trying to trigger an event that should change the DOM and it's not changing
[16:41:38] <sahbeewah> that sounds independent of the extensions
[16:41:46] <sahbeewah> ?fiddle
[16:41:47] <bot-t> sahbeewah, #10785 (jQuery .html().replace breaks in IE7-8 only. Example fiddle ... - Opened 4 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10785

[16:41:54] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[16:42:44] <sahbeewah> if you provide some code people will find it easier to help
[16:43:35] <rebekah> yes of course
[16:43:41] <rebekah> I just got an idea
[16:43:46] <rebekah> I'm going to go and try that
[16:44:30] <rebekah> but if it doesn't work like the all of the others, then I will put up a question on stackoverflow with all of the details
[16:44:36] <rebekah> thanks everyone!
[17:17:55] <versatiletech> any drupal views pro in here that could lend me a hand in #drupal?
[17:39:13] <AlexWaters> is .length a method? I'm curious as to why is returns a string when operating on an array of dom elements. I assume it is
[17:39:19] <AlexWaters> does it always return a string?
[17:40:30] <AlexWaters> i'm very confused by how strongly typed jquery is... total noob
[17:41:26] <sahbeewah> .length is a property... it returns an integer
[17:41:27] <b-ot> sahbeewah, memorised “length”.
[17:41:45] <sahbeewah> dumb bot
[17:42:59] <AlexWaters> sahbeewah: thanks
[19:16:52] <bleen> I'm looking at someone else's code and I see this:  $('.foo').bind('change.classname', function(){ … });  … I've never seen an event like that. What does change.classname mean?
[19:17:08] <bleen> …classname is just a placeholder here for some class...

[20:31:18] <min|dvir|us> Hi, gnarf, you around?
[20:35:42] <cryptopsy> i see people offering bits of jquery with their js apps, is there a jquery builder that constructs these smaller jquery.js scripts?
[20:37:30] <coldhead> i think that's still on the TODO list, cryptopsy
[20:38:11] <cryptopsy> its on my todo list
[20:38:15] <cryptopsy> where do i join the team?
[20:39:00] <coldhead> https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[20:39:25] <cryptopsy> which part of that is the buildeR?
[20:40:45] <coldhead> cryptopsy, ask in #jQuery-dev?
[20:40:51] <coldhead> i've never built jquery
[20:40:59] <coldhead> its pretty much my first day
[20:41:11] <cryptopsy> then there's probalby a builder you dont know about
[20:41:13] <tw2113> it is, i've never seen coldhead before, and i'm in here regularly
[20:41:23] <cryptopsy> it is what
[20:41:25] <cryptopsy> on the todo list?
[20:41:57] <coldhead> cryptopsy: i read recently that the dev team are trying to make jquery more modular
[20:42:04] <coldhead> so custom builds become possible
[20:42:30] <coldhead> but i don't see it on the jquery download page
[20:42:37] <coldhead> so i don't think it's "a thing" yet
[20:42:52] <cryptopsy> what the fuck do you need jquery for?
[20:43:57] <coldhead> i'm still trying to figure that out
[20:44:14] <cryptopsy> what are you using it for?
[20:44:24] <vladikoff> parse html
[20:44:48] <cryptopsy> was asking coldhead
[20:44:55] <cryptopsy> what do you parse?
[20:45:03] <raj> arse
[20:45:27] <coldhead> i was using jQuery for DOM manipulation yesterday and moving content between nodes
[20:45:33] <coldhead> it worked pretty well
[20:45:48] <coldhead> but it seems like it does ajax and more
[20:52:37] <wilornel> cryptosy: jQuery is just making coding easier
[20:54:51] <cryptopsy> that's basically saying nothing
[20:55:53] <coldhead> all affirmations are true in some sense, false in some sense, meaningless in some sense, true and false in some sense, true and meaningless in some sense, false and meaningless in some sense, and true and false and meaningless in some sense
[20:56:05] <wilornel> ...
[20:56:28] <wilornel> jQuery would be like a better version of javascript
[20:57:59] <LoneStar99> trying to parse "tasks" from the following code --> http://jsfiddle.net/Tp95Z/4/
[20:58:37] <tw2113> $() is totally easier to type than document.querySelector()
[20:58:53] <wilornel> see? EASIER
[21:00:18] <archonic> coldhead:  You seem surprised that jQuery was making your task nicer?
[21:00:37] <coldhead> it was a nice surprise
[21:00:43] <coldhead> like finding out there is more champagne
[21:01:30] <archonic> Haha.  I don't think I'd enjoy JavaScript as much without it
[21:01:49] <coldhead> so far it's the only thing i like about JS
[21:02:01] <archonic> No love for closures?  :)
[21:03:30] <coldhead> oh yes i like them too
[21:03:37] <wilornel> LoneStar: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4017122/jquery-reading-nested-json
[21:03:44] <coldhead> but if i got paid $1 for every time i had to type function () {}
[21:03:51] <coldhead> i would have so much $1s
[21:05:05] <tw2113> imagine trying to do this shit without inspectors
[21:05:42] <LoneStar99> thanks tw2113
[21:06:09] <coldhead> i remember trying to do this shit without inspectors
[21:06:18] <coldhead> it was worse than debugging php
[21:07:29] <min|dvir|us> coldhead: any particular beef with JS you'd like to go over, or is it just not PHP?
[21:08:41] <AlexWaters> coldhead: hey man, thanks for the help the other day. I'm just looking into jQuery myself. Lynda has a decent but dated video on it. The exercise files are really solid for experimenting though
[21:09:20] <coldhead> things about JS that make me very tired: having to type function () {}, no string interpolation, no multi-line strings, regular expressions are weak, ASI is lame
[21:14:04] <min|dvir|us> coldhead: 1) fair 2) many libraries (incl. jQuery) have a templating library 3) fair 4) got an alternative? 5) ASI?
[21:15:32] <vladikoff> min|dvir|us, auto semicolon insertion
[21:15:58] <coldhead> 4) perl 5 or 6 would be ideal :P
[21:16:05] <min|dvir|us> coldhead: 9/10 criticism. Props.
[21:16:15] <min|dvir|us> (The grade is curved.)
[21:16:19] <coldhead> lol
[21:16:22] <vladikoff> and it's only his first day!
[21:16:54] <tw2113> coldhead catches on quick
[21:18:09] <coldhead> i've been doing js since before 9/11, it's just my first day with jQuery
[21:20:02] <ryanneufeld> hey coldhead
[21:20:40] <coldhead> ryry!
[21:20:51] <coldhead> happy weekend
[21:20:53] <ryanneufeld> ?hi5 @coldhead
[21:20:54] <bot-t> coldhead, ⋰⁵⋱
[21:21:22] <ryanneufeld> happy weekend to you too
[21:22:43] <coldhead> i bloody well earned this one -_-
[21:23:03] <ryanneufeld> ditto
[21:27:05] <Palanivel> Hi Gud morning to all..... i have a small doubt regarding input focus..........i know this is simple thing but am not getting.....when ever page load the first input field have been focused.......am tried lot....if any one know please share with me
[21:33:43] <coldhead> Palanivel: http://jsfiddle.net/vSWPu/3/
[21:42:06] <min|dvir|us> coldhead: familiar with CoffeeScript?
[21:43:09] <Gates> I have jquery loaded and it /was/ working, the slider works and other things
[21:43:14] <Gates> but i cannot get my script to work
[21:43:25] <Gates> i got it to work in a fiddle but not on site
[21:43:37] <min|dvir|us> Gates: is your console open?
[21:43:42] <Gates> yes
[21:43:47] <min|dvir|us> Gates: anything useful?
[21:44:42] <Gates> just a type error for $
[21:44:47] <Gates> but that shouldnt actually be an issue
[21:44:50] <min|dvir|us> Just?
[21:44:53] <min|dvir|us> Any error is an issue.
[21:45:11] <min|dvir|us> Look at the traceback and see which lines are your code.
[21:45:13] * Gates Site: http://makerofaweso.me/bridgestreet/
[21:45:30] <Gates> desired effect: http://css-tricks.com/examples/SmoothPageScroll/
[21:45:38] <min|dvir|us> Gates: fix the error first.
[21:45:41] <coldhead> min|dvir|us: i've used coffeescript a little. it fixes most of the things that annoy me about js and replaces them significant whitespace woes and the burden of compilation. also the name is terrible
[21:45:45] <Gates> kk
[21:45:45] <coldhead> but it eases the pain
[21:46:48] <Gates> there is none
[21:47:03] <min|dvir|us> coldhead: significant whitespace is the future.
[21:47:12] <min|dvir|us> Also, I'm partial to the name.
[21:47:17] <coldhead> listen to yourself, min|dvir|us :)
[21:47:32] <coldhead> "the future is whether you have three spaces or four"
[21:47:36] <coldhead> it sounds crazy :)
[21:47:44] <shoky> Gates: your responsive-slider.js is calling jQuery.noConflict()
[21:47:54] <Gates> what does that mean
[21:48:01] <Gates> its switching it to jQuery from $
[21:48:14] <shoky> it's removing the global $
[21:48:16] <min|dvir|us> Other way around.
[21:48:24] <min|dvir|us> You should use jQuery(function ($) {});.
[21:48:27] <Gates> how to i renable
[21:49:07] <Gates> jQuery(document).ready(function($) { ... }
[21:49:10] <Gates> )}; *
[21:49:15] <shoky> yep
[21:49:17] <min|dvir|us> Gates: that's another way of doing it, yes.
[21:49:26] <Gates> can i uncall it
[21:49:28] <Gates> revoke
[21:49:51] <shoky> you don't need to if you use that $ argument to the ready handler..
[21:50:05] <shoky> but if you really wanna, window.$ = jQuery
[21:50:14] <min|dvir|us> Don't tell him that.
[21:50:18] <shoky> :( sry
[21:50:25] <Gates> lol
[21:51:37] <min|dvir|us> Gates: it's not funny. If you do it, you will basically have to deal with you sucking as a programmer.
[21:52:40] <Gates> yea
[21:52:41] <shoky> we'll have to deal with it too
[21:52:54] <Gates> ^_^

[22:38:29] <shoky> modifying a plugin? do ya know what you're doing?
[22:45:14] <min|dvir|us> shoky: it's not that big of a deal IMO.
[22:45:36] <tw2113> did you fork it first?
[22:45:43] <tw2113> did you buy it dinner before the forking?
[22:46:00] * min|dvir|us throws a tomato
[22:46:05] <shoky> what's not that big of a deal
[22:46:27] <min|dvir|us> shoky: modifying a plugin.
[22:46:53] <shoky> i didnt say it was, i was just asking inorder to be of better help
[22:47:02] <min|dvir|us> Any usage of a plugin is kind of modification by extension anyway.
[22:47:29] <shoky> kind of..
[22:48:26] <tw2113> in the sense of merging default options and the ones you want
[22:49:49] <shoky> g'nite
