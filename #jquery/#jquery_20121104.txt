[00:21:36] <alfanso> Hi Guys, I created a simplest javascript validation library. If you wanna check it out https://github.com/ashitvora/validator
[01:52:42] <motox> I have an absolute div with overflow set to auto, and another absolute div nested within that div.  The nested div is updated via AJAX.  However, if the content causes the parent div to overflow, the nested div loses its background color on the overflowed content.  Can someone take a look at this and let me know if they have any ideas?  http://jsfiddle.net/TGceb/1/
[01:28:46] <abletony84> Hey! How did GitHub manage to get that new code editor? Is it something they made from scratch or is it a jQuery plugin or something?
[01:33:01] <aqeel> hi room
[01:33:47] <abletony84> hey hey
[01:59:56] <Hornet> question time: is anyone aware of any particularly good complimentary libraries to jquery?
[02:00:44] <Hornet> both in terms of 'lower' functionality, eg underscore, or higher, such as ext?
[02:19:51] <Browser> Good morning
[02:38:54] <DukeDrake> hi
[02:39:31] <DukeDrake> when transferring a bit of html as "text" with $.post - how can i convert it to a jquery object?
[03:39:14] <houman> hi, I wonder if its possible that I define the status myself from the server? $("#success").load(url,  function(response, status, xhr) { .. }
[03:39:30] <houman> or is it just the usual 404 status ?
[03:39:51] <houman> what I mean is, could i ause it as a validation error found?
[03:50:14] <DukeDrake> If I transfer html as "text" with $.post() - how can i convert it to a jquery object?
[04:07:58] <FrameFever> How can I check if an element is currently in the DOM?
[04:37:53] <BinaryKitten> FrameFever  use .length
[04:38:23] <BinaryKitten> if ($(selector).length > 0) { console.log('element found!') }
[04:38:54] <BinaryKitten> for best use us a variable. var myItem = $(selector); if (myItem.length > 0) { myItem.stuff(); }
[05:14:05] <Jerbot> I have a script using jQuery that targets a php script which is in a parent directory....
[05:14:13] <Parhs> http://pastebin.com/1iekjvbj  hello i have a gotcha here
[05:14:17] <Jerbot> I'm wondering if I targetted it properly: ../phpscript.php
[05:14:26] <Jerbot> I also tried /../phpscript.php
[05:14:35] <Parhs> init:function is called on document ready
[05:14:45] <Jerbot> It doesn't seem like the script is functioning properly, you know?  So, I'm wondering if I need to use an absolute path.
[05:14:47] <Parhs> but sometimes it doesnt show the markers
[05:19:26] <Jerbot> nobody about huh? :(
[05:32:33] <BinaryKitten> Muimi if that script outside the webroot?
[05:33:05] <BinaryKitten> Muimi if so, then it will never work as you cannot access the files on a server that are not in the web root or proxied by something that is
[05:39:19] <K3|Chris> any idea why .slideToggle(); on a click creates a looping action?
[05:40:45] <BinaryKitten> nope, not without seeing you code. are you sure you've not got something triggering the click after?
[05:41:53] <K3|Chris> I'll fiddle it
[05:45:38] <K3|Chris> weird, my fiddle works
[05:46:21] <K3|Chris> but on my site using the same code it opens, closes, opens again about 5 times
[05:49:26] <BinaryKitten> something else must be triggering it in reaction
[05:50:25] <K3|Chris> only line of jQ I got on the site atm, though it's a wordpress based site, always the problem when you don't have complete control
[05:51:26] <BinaryKitten> you could check for the "is animating" flag
[05:51:43] <BinaryKitten> but doubt that would solve the actual issue
[05:52:03] <BinaryKitten> it looks like something is hooking the click and clicking again
[05:52:21] <BinaryKitten> *s/looks/sounds
[05:52:25] <BinaryKitten> since i can't see it
[05:54:13] <Muimi> BinaryKitten: it's in webroot.
[05:55:18] <K3|Chris> BinaryKitten: actually that fixed it, but yeah sounds like something else is being naughty
[05:55:18] <Muimi> it's just like /public_html/site_directory (php_script and html_form)/js_directory (js file here references the php scirpt)
[05:56:35] <BinaryKitten> since js is never executed in it's folder but always in the folder that links it in
[05:56:56] <BinaryKitten> the php script is just a location
[05:58:25] <Muimi> no idea what that means. :P
[05:59:24] <K3|Chris> BinaryKitten: my fiddle with the working fix btw: http://jsfiddle.net/KriLL3/6kaAd/
[06:00:05] <BinaryKitten> K3|Chris mind if i suggest a few improvements?
[06:00:09] <K3|Chris> sure
[06:03:16] <K3|Chris> reason for the parent selector is that it's not a unique element
[06:03:47] <BinaryKitten> K3|Chris http://jsfiddle.net/6kaAd/1/
[06:04:33] <K3|Chris> yeah that's neater
[06:04:35] <K3|Chris> thanks
[06:04:56] <BinaryKitten> and slightly faster as well
[06:05:06] <BinaryKitten> as only does 1 lookup/find for the whole click
[06:05:19] <BinaryKitten> rather than the x amount it was doing before
[06:08:07] * BinaryKitten departs properly for the upteenth time
[06:12:02] <proview2> has anybody here ever used jquery UI sortable together with draggabbe?
[06:12:35] <proview2> I'm trying to make both work, but getting issues http://jsfiddle.net/rUMAX/ the elements are being cloned instead of 'moved', and the drop doesn't work for recently moved items
[06:20:19] <reloadz> hi! i use setInterval() for gallery! how can i stop setinterval() takeing action when user clicks on div
[06:25:59] <govinda_> The official documentation is not that solid, any recomendations for a newfriend?
[06:26:37] <proview2> it seems I posted the wrong url, this is the right one http://jsfiddle.net/rUMAX/1/
[06:27:00] <proview2> can anyone point me in the right direction?
[06:29:26] <proview2> @govinda read "Professional Javascript for Web Developers" and then "jQuery in Action"
[06:29:43] <govinda_> thank you very much!
[06:42:33] <treeprogram> Hi, does any know any good jquery cookie tutorials? I'm a complete jquery newbie, and I'm trying to save a user's select box selection to a cookie about their clicking the submit button, then setting the value of that select box to the value in their cookie when they return the site
[06:43:18] <treeprogram> "select box selection to a cookie about their clicking " -> "select box selection to a cookie upon their clicking "
[06:43:50] <proview2> http://webhole.net/2010/07/10/jquery-cookies-example/
[06:50:03] <treeprogram> proview2 thanks for the link, that's a great tutorial. Any tutorials that include a lesson on how I can pre-select the value of a select box to the cookie value?
[06:51:32] <proview2> treeprogram: I'm guessing something like $(<the_selector_for_the_select_box>).val(<cookie_value>)
[06:52:22] <treeprogram> proview2 hmm seems wonderfully simple and easy
[06:52:58] <Parhs> hello i have a scrollbar style
[06:53:01] <proview2> e.g selected_value = $.cookie("saved_selection"); $("post_category_id").val(selected_value);
[06:53:04] <Parhs> how can i apply it to all ?
[06:54:01] <treeprogram> thanks proview2, I'll copy this and save it to try out later
[06:54:14] <proview2> np
[06:54:47] <proview2> I'm trying to use  jquery UI sortable together with draggable, http://jsfiddle.net/rUMAX/1/ the elements are being cloned instead of 'moved', and the drop doesn't work for recently moved items, any recommendations? or just pointers in the right direction?
[06:54:57] <proview2> already googled this to death, went through documentation, etc...
[06:56:59] <serrano> i have a div that has slidetoggle on it, inside are links "<a>", but they dont work since when i click on them the div slides away
[06:57:11] <serrano> is htere a way to make slidetoggle to ignore the links?
[06:57:36] <serrano> and just follow them
[06:58:57] <proview2> @serrano, see if this one helps http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[06:59:55] <seutje> serrano: either check e.target in the handler for the divs, or fire e.stopPropagation on the links
[07:00:18] <proview2> stopPropagation sounds right
[07:01:17] <serrano> cool
[07:28:48] <DeltaHeavy> I have a click event that's created every time a function is run. Due to scope issues from this application scaling I'm running into some problems. The click event is for an object (HTML) created inside of that function, thus why the click event is run on that function. Anybody know how I can move this event out of this function to fix scope issues, and have it continue to work even if more objects are created?
[07:29:41] <govinda_> Why should govinda use the JQuery?
[07:30:46] <DeltaHeavy> This is the event I'm talking about: http://pastebin.com/0fT2gYu2
[07:31:07] <DeltaHeavy> govinda_: It makes things a lot easier. Code more do less.
[07:31:49] <govinda> How may I master the JQery?
[07:35:03] <NexHD> hi everyone
[07:35:21] <govinda> hi NexHD
[07:35:39] <NexHD> how i cenzor some ilegal words in a text?
[07:37:05] <NexHD> equivalent to str_replace (PHP)
[07:37:11] <NexHD> in jquery
[07:37:13] <NexHD> how i do?
[07:37:26] <DeltaHeavy> NexHD: The 'replace' method.
[07:37:50] <NexHD> ok thanks
[07:37:51] <DeltaHeavy> 'Some String'.replace('S', 'F');
[07:37:56] <DeltaHeavy> Fome Ftring
[07:41:52] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: it sounds like you want to use event delegation
[07:42:04] <shoky> delegating the click event to some static container element
[07:42:26] <shoky> e.g. $('#someContainer').on('click', '.itemClass', function(e) { ... })
[07:42:36] <proview2> I'm trying to use  jquery UI sortable together with draggable, http://jsfiddle.net/rUMAX/1/ the elements are being cloned instead of 'moved', and the drop doesn't work for recently moved items, any recommendations? or just pointers in the right direction?
[07:43:30] <shoky> proview2: i've been trying with no luck. closest i got was:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/rUMAX/2/
[07:44:10] <shoky> but.. the drop doesnt work ;p
[07:44:25] <proview2> shaky thanks
[07:44:54] <proview2> *shoky
[07:45:25] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Thanks. So I would declare this outside of the function in question? In $(document).ready? The current event is in a function outside of document.ready
[07:45:47] <proview2> wow , someone made it work by modifying urs
[07:46:02] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: yeah in $(docuemnt).ready, or whenever that #someContainer is known to exist..
[07:46:19] <proview2> http://jsfiddle.net/rUMAX/3/
[07:46:30] <shoky> i doubt they modified mine, i just saved it a minute ago..
[07:46:31] <NexHD> i dont want to replace the entire block of text just some words of the block text?
[07:46:35] <NexHD> how i do?
[07:46:55] <proview2> nah, still same problem
[07:47:40] <shoky> ok so maybe it was mine

[07:48:23] <shoky> not this guy again
[07:48:30] <shoky> djhonyy: STFU
[07:49:55] <proview2> shaky, at least now I can drag the same item between lists, but the drop is not working for newly dragged items, and still clones it
[07:51:11] <proview2> *shoky, srry to keep misspelling it
[07:51:34] <shoky> don't worry bout it ;]
[07:53:19] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: The element is created in the actual function I had it originally. I moved the event and changed it to a .on event for delegation and it doesn't work at all now. Did you mean by wherever the element exists the delegation event needs to exist being the function I had it in originally?
[07:54:16] <shoky> which element did you delegate to?
[07:54:27] <shoky> in place of #someContainer
[07:54:32] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: $('#item-duplicate_' + itemIndex).on('click', '.item-duplicate', function(e) {
[07:54:37] <shoky> no..
[07:54:47] <DeltaHeavy> Basically every time that function is called, it creates a bunch of HTML, including a duplicate button.
[07:55:14] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: What am I doing wrong here?
[07:55:47] <DeltaHeavy> I'm looking at: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/delegate-vs-on
[07:56:32] <shoky> you need to find a container element which is already in the DOM, such as document or <body> or some container <div> you have, that contains all of the item-duplicates
[07:56:54] <shoky> e.g. $(document).on('click', '.item-duplicate', function..
[07:57:28] <shoky> but it's better if you limit it to the closest ancestor of all .item-duplicates
[07:57:48] <shoky> you should look at- see ?on
[07:57:49] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:57:55] <shoky> the part about event delegation

[07:58:33] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: And that allows when I click on the newly injected HTML to trigger that event? Or when I click on the element in the jQuery handler $('document')?
[07:59:17] <shoky> it will trigger the callback anytime an .item-duplicate (which is a descendant of document..) is clicked
[07:59:31] <NexHD> how i write in jquery this " if is inarray
[07:59:31] <NexHD> ?
[07:59:40] <shoky> even for .item-duplicate's that are added dynamically
[08:00:01] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Ok awesome, let me try this out.
[08:00:52] <shoky> NexHD: if (myArray.indexOf(item) != -1) { .. }
[08:01:12] <shoky> or mm
[08:01:15] <shoky> ?inArray
[08:01:16] <bot-t> jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[08:01:41] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: It's looking good. Running into some other errors now but I think that got it
[08:01:57] <shoky> sweet
[08:03:48] <kvarley> How can I use a pipe | symbol in my appendTo string?
[08:04:42] <proview2> @shoky unfortunately i need to go, thanks for the help, I get the feeling the key of this might lie in forgetting draggable all together like this one http://jsfiddle.net/VUuyx/
[08:06:48] <shoky> proview2: that one works, but there is no dropping of a sortable's dragged element into a droppable
[08:07:00] <shoky> the droppable is only used for the 'over' and 'out' events
[08:07:15] <proview2> lol thats true, just realised that
[08:07:24] <proview2> oh well, better luck tomorrow hopefully
[08:07:30] <proview2> thanks for the help either way :)
[08:07:35] <shoky> aye, gluck with it ;p

[08:43:33] <chrispercol> hi, I'd like to add an li to an existing list using an existing block of html, what is the best approach?
[08:45:30] <shoky> chrispercol:  $('#mylist').append('<li>hi</li>')  works
[08:46:38] <chrispercol> shoky: cheers, but the li contains quite a lot code and I'm thinking there must be an easier way than writing all it's html in the middle of jquery?
[08:47:07] <shoky> oh, you mean you want to clone an existing DOM element?
[08:47:25] <shoky> i thought you had a string of html already
[08:47:56] <chrispercol> yes, this is where I am up to... http://pastebin.com/DpwZQCyP
[08:48:00] <shoky> anyways.. you can use .clone()
[08:48:18] * djhonyy está away; Auto-away; inativo por 1802 segs - desde[13:48:13] site[n/a] email[none@none] uin[none] log[on] pager[off] -=[Cyber]=-
[08:48:45] <shoky> so maybe:   $('.newFrontpageItem').clone().appendTo('#sortable')
[08:49:31] <chrispercol> that's progress, thanks :-)
[08:50:55] <jfeust> In this code, why doesn't the remove() run after the fadeOut(): http://jsfiddle.net/5xDLT/
[08:51:16] <jfeust> i need to fade out THEN remove from dom
[08:51:19] <shoky> jfeust: because .remove() isn't an animation (or something that is queued)
[08:51:28] <jfeust> how could I achieve this then?
[08:51:41] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/5xDLT/1/
[08:51:56] <jfeust> doh, makes sense
[08:51:56] <jfeust> thx
[08:53:36] <chrispercol> shoky: how do I stop clone from cloning every element with .newFrontpageItem ie. first time I click one is added, second two more etc?

[09:04:27] <Absolute0> Is there anything that can prevent an element from being dragged after $('#foobar').draggable() is invoked?
[09:04:52] <Absolute0> I am using it all over the place in my app; it works just fine. But for one particular element it doesn't seem to register.
[09:39:11] <erisco> QUnit only runs the first test. I'm copying examples directly from the web site. Why?
[09:40:17] <gnarf> ?demo @erisco
[09:40:17] <bot-t> erisco, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:40:30] <gnarf> erisco: easier to tell if I can see the code
[09:40:57] <gnarf> erisco: first thoughts - async Test that doesn't finish.  second thought - all the tests aren't registered when document is ready
[09:41:41] <gnarf> Absolute0: i'm pretty sure adding ui-disabled class should disable the draggable
[09:41:47] <erisco> setup qunit-1..10.0.js and copy the "keeping tests atomic" example from http://qunitjs.com/cookbook/
[09:42:02] <erisco> or the "grouping tests" example
[09:42:20] <erisco> or just write any two tests yourself... only one is running
[09:42:24] <gnarf> Absolute0: also could try .draggable( "option", "disabled", true )
[09:42:30] <Absolute0> gnarf: I was clicking an element in front of ti!
[09:42:36] <Absolute0> so setting the z-index fixed it
[09:43:20] <gnarf> erisco: I'm pretty sure if there was a bug that big in the demo, we'd be seeing it
[09:43:41] <gnarf> erisco: I haven't had this same issue, do you have your test case online somewhere I can see it?
[09:44:04] <erisco> I am using Chrome Version 22.0.1229.94 m you?
[09:44:44] <gnarf> erisco: also doubt it has anything to do with browser version
[09:45:09] <gnarf> erisco: can you link me to the suite thats failing?
[09:45:18] <gnarf> or should I just stop trying to help?
[09:45:31] <erisco> gnarf, really? because it works in IE
[09:45:57] <gnarf> erisco: i said doubt - it could be a part of it for some other reason yet unknown
[09:46:50] <gnarf> again, really hard to say what might be the problem in some code out there in the wild that I'm not able to debug
[09:51:04] <gnarf> djhonyy: can you please turn off that auto-away annoucement?
[09:51:21] <djhonyy> ah ok, sorry
[09:52:17] <djhonyy> done, my bad!
[09:52:51] <gnarf> erisco: I gotta get back to work, ping me if you decided to link me to the problem at some point
[09:53:06] <erisco> gnarf, are you using the same Chrome version as me?
[09:53:37] <gnarf> erisco: if thats current stable, yeah
[09:53:48] <erisco> gnarf, could you double check that please?
[09:54:19] <gnarf> erisco: no, because if there's an issue with qunit, I'm gonna look at it regardless of exact version match of chromes, we should see an issue
[09:54:58] <gnarf> erisco: in other words, I'm 98% sure that I also have the same chrome build, but I don't care enough to look since you don't seem to care enough to provide a simple link to your test suite
[09:55:09] <erisco> gnarf, I'll ask someone else then. Thank-you for your time
[09:56:24] <gnarf> erisco: also FYI - I'm on the jQuery Core, UI, Infrastructure teams and have a lot of experience with qunit and the rest of our projects use it
[09:56:33] <gnarf> so like
[09:57:35] <gnarf> I'm the closest to a qunit author you'll possibly find online short of JÃ¶rn himself - All I'm asking for is to be able to see this issue for myself
[09:57:43] <gnarf> and you've taken 15 minutes to not give it to me
[09:59:54] * gnarf shrugs

[10:10:20] <rgoytacaz> Hello there, I want a certain element to follow the user's viewport, whats is this called? I'm looking to read on it, but can't seem to find a proper name.
[10:12:21] <shoky> mouse cursor?
[10:13:13] <krz> what is https://status.heroku.com/ using here
[10:15:09] <rgoytacaz> shoky: ? mouse cursor?
[10:15:28] <shoky> rgoytacaz: i don't know what you meant by 'follow the user's viewport'
[10:15:37] <shoky> so i assumed maybe you meant cursor..
[10:16:49] <rgoytacaz> shoky: http://pixeltango.com/resources/web-development/jquery-bullseye-viewport-detection-events/ go to the end of the page.
[10:16:58] <rgoytacaz> you will see that theres a div, with an ad
[10:17:09] <rgoytacaz> that follows the viewport as you scroll all the way down.
[10:17:33] <shoky> oh. sticky elements
[10:18:12] <shoky> you use CSS for it..  position:fixed for example
[10:19:41] <rgoytacaz> shoky: not talking about the elements in the lower right.
[10:20:11] <rgoytacaz> shoky: look for "ADVERTISE HERE!"
[10:20:33] <rgoytacaz> you will see that the div, will scroll down with you, if you go past it.
[10:21:30] <Gho5t> if root is  a  jquery object, is there a reason why  $root.eq(0).style is undefined by $root[0].style isn't?
[10:21:38] <Gho5t> *but
[10:24:44] <rgoytacaz> shoky: stick elements, ya. found a couple things on it.
[10:24:46] <rgoytacaz> shoky: thx.
[10:28:12] <gnarf> Gho5t: .eq() leaves it wrapped in jQuery, it doesn't return a DOM element, it returns a jQuery object
[10:28:17] <gnarf> Gho5t: see ?get
[10:28:18] <bot-t> Gho5t, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[10:28:34] <Gho5t> ah ok
[10:36:46] <josh91> im using visual studio 2010 with jquery 1.8.2. How do i call the id of an asp.net element with just " $("#txtDate")" for example
[10:37:11] <josh91> its an asp.net textbox
[10:44:06] <josh91> I have to use "#<%=txtDate.ClientID%>" to get it to work but i've seen its possible with just #txtDate
[10:46:53] <NexHD> can someone tell me if this code is correct ? http://jsfiddle.net/KTKrt/
[10:54:34] <cincinnatus> Is there a Backbone-like library that works well with jQuery?
[10:54:51] <shoky> NexHD: hardly anything about that code is correct
[10:55:05] <gnarf> like backbone?
[10:55:12] <TraeRegan> AngularJS is awesome
[10:56:26] <gnarf> josh91: sorry, no clue with .NET stuff - you look around on stack overflow yet?
[10:56:30] <aFeijo> hi folks, in my click() function, I'm using .not() to check if the clicked element isn't already active, like this: if ($this.not('.active')) {}, but it is not running for my elements that has no .active class, why?
[10:56:40] <TraeRegan> and jQ friendly (although I don't know why you think Backbone isn't)
[10:57:01] <gnarf> aFeijo: so .not() returns a jQuery object, which will always be true
[10:57:05] <gnarf> aFeijo: a few quick fixes
[10:57:20] <gnarf> aFeijo: #1 - check .length to see if not filtered it
[10:57:32] <josh91> gnarf: I've had a quick look, i'll hav another search for a solution
[10:57:39] <gnarf> aFeijo: #2 - use .is() instead --- if ( !$this.is(".active") )
[10:58:06] <gnarf> aFeijo: is returns a boolean
[10:58:22] <gnarf> aFeijo: .not() is more like .filter( ! selector )
[10:58:26] <cincinnatus> does using any of those libraries (angular, backbone, etc) make sense if your backend is not JavaScript?
[10:58:27] <aFeijo> gnarf, testing with if() :)
[10:58:32] <cincinnatus> (I'm using Django)
[10:58:36] <aFeijo> is() I mean
[10:58:56] <shoky> NexHD: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/KTKrt/1/
[10:59:02] <TraeRegan> cincinnatus: sure, they're all backend agnostic
[10:59:02] <NexHD> ok thanks
[10:59:55] <TraeRegan> cincinnatus: they can consume JSON, JSONP, etc.
[10:59:59] <ganeshmax> aFeijo: there is yet another way to check for the presence of classes... if(!$this.hasClass('active')) { // do something }
[11:01:34] <aFeijo> ganeshmax, oh yeah, I totally forgot about hasClass :)
[11:02:53] <ganeshmax> aFeijo: hope it worked
[11:03:39] <aFeijo> it did, thanks gnarf and ganeshmax.
[11:06:46] <ejo> Should I use .prop() or .attr() to set 'contextmenu' on, for example, a table cell?
[11:07:14] <ejo> from what I'm reading I can probably do either just as well, but if I need to support older browsers I would need to be more careful.  Is that correct?
[11:09:04] <NexHD> shoky: how i select the word or the match? to output the text that was on input value
[11:09:04] <NexHD> ?
[11:24:31] <gnarf> isn't contextmenu an event ejo? you should be using .on()
[11:51:35] <airshock> Hi all. Very new to jQuery and just followed a simple tutorial on adding a progress bar to my audio upload script. All the code seems correct but I get an "undefined is not a function" error.
[11:51:50] <airshock> Can anyone take a look at my code and perhaps tell me where I'm going wrong? Thanks. http://pastesite.com/83214
[11:53:28] <razzi> airshock, which line?
[11:55:25] <airshock> It gets stuck when evaluating evaluating '$("#uploadprogressbar").progressBar()'
[11:58:43] <razzi> so you have somewhere on the page an element with id="uploadprogressbar" ?
[11:59:21] <airshock> razzi: Yes, it's a span element.
[11:59:50] <shoky> it's .progressbar()
[12:01:15] <airshock> shoky: What do you mean? Is that where the specific problem is?
[12:01:28] <shoky> i mean you have the wrong case for the 'b'
[12:01:33] <shoky> progressbar, not progressBar
[12:01:52] <shoky> also, doesn't look like you're including jquery UI css file
[12:02:19] <shoky> unless that's included in one of those 2 included css's
[12:03:32] <airshock> shoky: I thought jQuery UI was a JS file, which included several lines above the script?
[12:03:57] <shoky> airshock: there's also CSS to go with it
[12:04:27] <shoky> follow what jqueryui.com says
[12:05:23] <airshock> shoky: OK, will do. Also do you see any other errors in the script that may not necessarily show up in the browser? For some reason the browser isn't calling the progress.php file mentioned farther down in the script when it should be, and so the progress bar isn't actually working.
[12:06:19] <airshock> shoky: And I just changed progressBar to progressbar and the type error is now gone. :)
[12:08:09] <shoky> airshock:  eval ("response = " + data);
[12:08:10] <shoky> wtf?
[12:08:19] <shoky> don't use eval, ever.
[12:08:41] <shoky> especially not when it makes no sense..
[12:09:16] <shoky> also i don't know what you think  $("#uploadprogressbar").progressBar(percentage);   does
[12:09:32] <shoky> follow what jqueryui.com says and you'll be fine
[12:10:27] <shoky> (btw you should use JSON.parse or $.parseJSON to parse json into a JS object)
[12:10:54] <airshock> shoky: I didn't write that code, it was on a tutorial I found (and the demo they had was working fine). I know almost nothing at all about jQuery and only change the code when I changed the IDs of the HTML elements it pointed to.
[12:11:18] <NexHD> shoky how i select the match of inArray?
[12:13:04] <shoky> NexHD: what do you mean, the match? it returns the index
[12:13:24] <NexHD> i want to modify the result
[12:13:32] <shoky> result of what..
[12:14:23] <wargasm08> hey, am i allowed to solicit a venture in here?
[12:14:52] <shoky> spam?
[12:14:58] <wargasm08> not exactly
[12:15:03] <shoky> almost exactly?
[12:15:04] <wargasm08> i'm looking for specific site owners
[12:15:44] <wargasm08> i'll just paste it and whatever.
[12:15:52] <wargasm08> We're about to launch the alpha version of our new ad serving platform. If you're able to provide us installs, we can make a lot of money together. Anyone involved in  content lockers, file sharing sites, porn sites, pay per download networks, freeware, or any web property that gets installs of some sort should hit me up and I'll show you what we're doing.
[12:16:15] <NexHD> shoky how i modify the result of that Array?
[12:16:31] <shoky> NexHD: arrays are arrays, they don't have results
[12:17:28] <airshock> wargasm08: I'm working on an audio sharing site, would I be able to work with your new platform? Sounds intriguing.
[12:17:47] <wargasm08> do people download audio files?
[12:18:23] <wargasm08> we're basically looking for people who can work with us to creatively drop our ad serving browser extension into the user's browser

[12:19:04] <wargasm08> you can hit me up in PM and we can chat if you like.
[12:19:13] <NexHD> i want to make if value of input match with array to modify that match
[12:19:14] <NexHD> ?
[12:19:42] <shoky> NexHD: what match?! you have an array, you have a value that you're looking for in that array. you can modify either of those whenever you want
[12:20:11] <airshock> wargasm08: Can you PM me? Not sure how to start a PM using this IRC client (Adium for Mac).
[12:20:20] <shoky> var index = $.inArray(myvalue, myarray); myarray[index] = 'WOW';
[12:20:32] <NexHD> shoky can i show you a exemple in php?
[12:20:35] <shoky> should check that it's not -1 of course
[12:20:41] <NexHD> in jquery i dont know how to do
[12:21:00] <shoky> i dont know php
[12:21:19] <shoky> you can put a link up .. sure.
[12:21:56] <NexHD> ok
[12:22:01] <wargasm> wah i crashed

[12:25:53] <jjb123> I have a quick question about the Chosen plugin if anyone can help. I want to know how to get the the last selected value in a multi select.  E.g. If I select A C F (as it appears to the user in the Chosen field), I want to get F. I tried taking the last index of the .val() of the field, but it never lines up with what it displays as. Any ideas?
[12:30:53] <NexHD> shoky any ideas
[12:30:53] <NexHD> ?
[12:31:31] <shoky> NexHD: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/KTKrt/3/
[12:32:35] <NexHD> ok
[12:32:39] <NexHD> i will try this
[12:32:40] <NexHD> thanks
[12:42:56] <enderx86> is there a way to perform a jquery ajax function on a form when it is submitted?
[12:43:07] <enderx86> is that functionality included in jquery?
[12:43:37] <shoky> enderx86: yes, handle the submit event and do event.preventDefault() to prevent a normal submit
[12:44:00] <shoky> like.. $('form').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault();  $.ajax(...); ... })
[12:44:15] <enderx86> thanks
[12:44:52] <shoky> and you can use .serialize() on the form and send that as the ajax data
[12:45:07] <shoky> if you wanna post the form itself
[12:47:03] <airshock> Can anyone help me get my progress bar implementation working? Followed a tutorial I found online since I don't know much jQuery, but when I submit my file upload form the progress bar doesn't work. Here is the code for the progress bar, after <script type="text/javascript"> : http://pastesite.com/83217
[12:47:28] <airshock> I don't know much jQuery at all so am not sure why things are not working. The demo in the tutorial worked fine and I followed it exactly.
[12:58:37] <enderx86> Why isn't my jQuery code working for this form?
[12:58:38] <enderx86> http://pastebin.com/12mNw8LN
[13:00:20] <rmurphey> ?ready @ enderx86
[13:00:21] <bot-t> enderx86, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[13:00:29] <enderx86> oh, right.
[13:05:35] <enderx86> okay, so it works now... except that I can't retrieve the value of my input field in jquery
[13:05:46] <enderx86> i think it already clears / resets to "" after I hit the submit button
[13:05:49] <enderx86> how can I stop it from resetting?
[13:11:23] <enderx86> err
[13:11:29] <enderx86> How can I grab the value of an input field in jQuery?
[13:13:23] <enderx86> got it: $('input:text').val()
[13:15:00] <grafi> .value()
[13:15:14] <grafi> nvm ._.
[13:16:04] <rmurphey> enderx86: depending on how many inputs you have on your page, you may want to be more specific
[13:16:11] <rmurphey> as that will just get the value from the first text input found
[13:16:13] <enderx86> I only have one text input
[13:23:15] <finspin> newbie question: is there a way to identify what jquery effect is attached to certain page elements?
[13:23:40] <finspin> other than digging through the code of course
[13:25:58] <urbann> finspin: I am no javascript expert but I think you have to look for a matching div or class tag
[13:27:21] <finspin> urbann: yeah, that's one way. i was wondering if there is a tool (e.g. firebug plugin) for that
[13:27:47] <wmfx> Hello Everyone.... is there a way to host   ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.0/jquery.min.js' type='text/javascript' on my development box I design websites on because my dev box dont get connected to the internet and I have a few scripts that reference  ajax.googleleapis.com (script src='http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.0/jquery.min.js' type='text/javascript'>)
[13:28:19] <urbann> finspin: I don't think so, but I am not the person to ask
[13:28:39] <wmfx> thanks
[13:29:08] <hellothere> Wmfx, cant you just download the library to your dev box and set the src attribute to you local machine
[13:29:53] <urbann> wmfx: yes you can just download the file
[13:30:17] <wmfx> that would be cool....im not sure....thats what Im asking.
[13:30:32] <wmfx> is it possible>>
[13:30:55] <rmurphey> wmfx: just go to http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.0/jquery.min.js
[13:30:59] <rmurphey> save the code locally
[13:31:06] <rmurphey> and change the script tag to point at the local file
[13:31:10] <hellothere> wmfx: yes. Just download the file and set the src= attribute to the path
[13:31:21] <wmfx> awesome
[13:31:39] <wmfx> can anyone point me in that direction?
[13:31:50] <rmurphey> we just did :)
[13:31:54] <hellothere> Go to the link hehe
[13:32:09] <wmfx> Oh cool thanks rnurphy
[13:32:27] <wmfx> i am soooooo slow today
[13:33:25] <wmfx> I Thank you Guys for the hand
[13:33:37] <hellothere> No problem
[13:34:16] <wmfx> DO I save that file as a .js file
[13:34:33] <rmurphey> ?tias
[13:34:34] <bot-t> Try It And See
[13:34:44] <wmfx> and name it jquery.min.js
[13:34:50] <hellothere> Just save it the same as it is currently named
[13:34:55] <hellothere> Yes
[13:35:15] <wmfx> Thanks Guys!!!
[13:35:28] <hellothere> You could name it however you wanted really.
[13:40:49] <enderx86> I have a python webserver running on port 5000. I'm trying to make an ajax call to localhost:5000 from localhost port 80. Is this allowed?
[13:43:13] <urbann> this might be the stupidest question today but I can't figure out how to get results from fiddle:
[13:43:13] <urbann> http://jsfiddle.net/weber/FyPbd/
[13:43:31] <john-dev> enderx86, you'll need jsonp for this..
[13:44:25] <john-dev> urbann, click run (top-left)
[13:45:22] <john-dev> enderx86, also, you could use a reverse proxy (there is a apche mod, but since you are using pythonâ€¦)
[13:45:37] <urbann> john-dev: yes I can run it but only the alert message work
[13:46:18] <urbann> john-dev: how can I get results in the results window?
[13:46:41] <john-dev> urbann, did you open your javascript console?
[13:47:25] <john-dev> in firefox its located under: extras -> web-developer -> javascript..
[13:47:36] <john-dev> web-console*
[13:48:11] <urbann> john-dev: yes, but what are the result window for then?
[13:48:32] <urbann> it make sense to get the result without open the console
[13:48:41] <urbann> no ?
[13:49:16] <john-dev> urbann, not really.. that's what you are looking for (using jquery)
[13:49:16] <john-dev> http://jsfiddle.net/DcVtR/
[13:49:53] <john-dev> i have simply created a div with the id "result" and added the value of test to it using jquery
[13:50:45] <urbann> john-dev: sometimes it takes really long time to figure out what you can not do! : )
[13:50:49] <urbann> thanks a lot
[13:51:10] <john-dev> you are welcome
[13:51:30] <john-dev> be sure to take jquery instead of mootools as library (on the left)
[13:53:51] <urbann> john-dev: yes, I save your example for next time I just want to try some simple stuff : )
[13:54:28] <john-dev> okay :-)
[14:06:53] <GunMan`> Hi guys. I'm in some trouble with jQuery and Ajax... Anyone got some time to help ?
[14:07:14] <john-dev> just ask
[14:07:56] <GunMan`> thanks :) ! Well I wrote a news system in PHP (mySQL), using jQuery and $.ajax for my backend, so I can add news, or delete news without refreshing my page
[14:08:26] <GunMan`> what I do is very simple, I initially ajax.load() my table
[14:08:47] <GunMan`> when I add a news with ajax, if the form is successfully sent, I reload my table again
[14:09:09] <GunMan`> but after a reload, my "delete" links do not work
[14:09:16] <john-dev> right
[14:09:29] <GunMan`> See link in PM
[14:09:31] <john-dev> GunMan`, i asume you use bind('click'..
[14:09:56] <GunMan`> mmh no, to be honest I don't even know what it is so
[14:10:16] <john-dev> you need to get live to get this working (on)
[14:10:30] <john-dev> which *.js file does handle the click event?
[14:10:40] <GunMan`> oh, yeah it's a click event, sorry
[14:10:49] <GunMan`> it's not a JS file, just JS code at the end of the page
[14:11:15] <GunMan`> line 203 for the delete code
[14:11:16] <john-dev> this can't work after the ajax.load request
[14:11:17] <john-dev> $(".delete_button").click
[14:11:36] <john-dev> because .click only triggers a class with delete_button, loaded after the dom was ready
[14:11:36] <GunMan`> that's what I figured out, but how to get it work ?
[14:11:48] <GunMan`> oh okay
[14:11:53] <john-dev> you need ot use on -> $('.delete_button').on('click',function() {
[14:12:09] <john-dev> on is .live, but .live is deprecated..
[14:12:57] <GunMan`> allright !
[14:13:01] <GunMan`> I'll give this a try right now
[14:13:04] <john-dev> sure..
[14:13:06] <john-dev> :-)
[14:13:21] <imsky> who uses .live
[14:13:47] <john-dev> nobody..
[14:14:01] <tw2113> zombies
[14:15:40] <GunMan`> nice one hehe !
[14:15:45] <john-dev> :-)
[14:15:48] <GunMan`> still doesn't work unfortunately :(
[14:15:57] <john-dev> ok wait a sec
[14:17:13] <GunMan`> sorry for being so lame with my questions I'm a total beginner !
[14:18:08] <john-dev> [23:17:59.196] ReferenceError: $ is not defined @ http://beta.aerodream-fr.net/admin/index.php?page=news#:57
[14:18:08] <john-dev> hmh
[14:18:32] <john-dev> you should really load everything in the <head></head> tag..
[14:18:38] <john-dev> at least jquery
[14:18:54] <GunMan`> Well I heard it would speed up things to get it loaded at the end of the code
[14:19:07] <john-dev> well, it somehow does
[14:19:35] <john-dev> load jquery as first framework and try it again
[14:20:19] <john-dev> you get erros because $.backstretch("../template/img/background.jpg", {speed: 1000 }); will be loaded before jquery is loaded, so $ doesnt exist
[14:21:03] <john-dev> further your monderizr script's path is wrong.. but that's now important for now..
[14:21:08] <john-dev> not*
[14:21:45] <GunMan`> done
[14:22:23] <GunMan`> my <head> tag is generated by another PHP page so I temporarily included jQuery in the <body> tag
[14:22:37] <GunMan`> but will dig in the code to put it at the right place
[14:22:44] <GunMan`> and still doesn't work
[14:22:50] <GunMan`> thanks for the tips.
[14:22:57] <GunMan`> do you use Firebug to look at these errors ?
[14:24:27] <john-dev> well i use the firefox console but firebug is fine too.. the problem is you execute a jquery ($) command in the header before jquery is loaded..
[14:24:45] <shoky> .on is not .live
[14:25:20] <GunMan`> I fixed the $.backstretch error
[14:25:38] <GunMan`> it was old code and $.backstretch was called twice ><
[14:27:33] <john-dev> puh.. things are messup up..
[14:28:06] <john-dev> still load jquery in the head of your page.. further use on <script> tag for the delete and add button.. does the add button work? in my case, the delete button doesnt work at all
[14:30:13] <GunMan`> the delete button works fine as long as you refresh the page
[14:30:20] <GunMan`> and the add button works fine anyway
[14:30:28] <shoky> try $('#update_div').on('click', function... )
[14:30:32] <shoky> oops
[14:30:48] <shoky> i meant: $('#update_div').on('click', '.delete-button', function() { ... })
[14:31:07] <shoky> that way you delegate the event handling to #update_div
[14:31:44] <shoky> er if it's working then nvm.
[14:32:05] <john-dev> thats not the problem at all
[14:32:21] <john-dev> i get a getElementById error from the beginning before doing anything..
[14:32:41] <GunMan`> could it be a browser issue ?
[14:32:46] <GunMan`> works fine for me on FF.
[14:32:58] <john-dev> i am on ff too, i dont think so..
[14:33:21] <john-dev> you pass an empty string to to jquery when clicking the delete button
[14:33:26] <GunMan`> I don't have that error
[14:34:24] <GunMan`> mmh
[14:34:26] <GunMan`> var dataString = \'id=\'+ id ;
[14:34:36] <GunMan`> (without backslashes)
[14:35:11] <GunMan`> the delete thing doesn't work at all, even if you refresh the page ?
[14:35:26] <john-dev> even if i dont refresh the page..
[14:37:03] <scrandaddy> hey there. i'm building a jquery plugin with a few dependencies that i concat into a single file with my plugin code. this works out nice except for that fact that the dependencies expose themselves globally. something like requirejs would work to prevent this, but i don't like the idea of my plugin depending on requirejs. is there any way to stop the dependencies from leaking into the global namespace?
[14:37:12] <GunMan`> no, I meant, if you refresh the page, the delete thing works, and then it goes fubar when you add something and try to delete something again
[14:38:20] <john-dev> nop,e it doesnt work at all..
[14:38:52] <adamo> howdy!
[14:38:54] <adamo> :)
[14:39:07] <GunMan`> that's very strange, it works for me
[14:39:20] <GunMan`> I'll empty my browser cache maybe
[14:40:16] <vrlogrs> hey guys
[14:40:28] <vrlogrs> im in need of some help -- been at this for hours now
[14:40:42] <GunMan`> still working fine here, as long as I dont ajax.load()
[14:41:07] <vrlogrs> http://www.funnode.com/chess -- the pieces are draggable .. the PROBLEM is that when i drag a piece, the image gets in the way of the mouseup
[14:41:20] <vrlogrs> if anyone can help, i will REALLY Appreciate it
[14:41:23] <shoky> GunMan`: $('#update_div').on('click', '.delete-button', function() { ... })
[14:41:34] <vrlogrs> been seriously at this for all day today
[14:41:40] <vrlogrs> and im SO CLOSE to getting it to work
[14:41:55] <vrlogrs> it looks like a very small/stupid thing that needs to be fixed
[14:41:58] <shoky> GunMan`: sorry  '.delete_button'
[14:42:29] <vrlogrs> can anyone help out?
[14:42:31] <vrlogrs> Please
[14:43:02] <vrlogrs> you have to start game -> play computer to see the pieces
[14:43:17] <vrlogrs> when you drag the piece, if the image is not in the way, then the piece is dropped properly
[14:43:17] <john-dev> vrlogrs, i dont realy get your problem
[14:43:33] <GunMan`> @shoky: doesn't work with this code :o
[14:44:01] <vrlogrs> while dragging a piece, john-dev, if the piece is in the way of the mouse and the square, then the piece doesnt get dropped on the right square
[14:44:10] <vrlogrs> because the mouse is not over the square, its over the piece
[14:44:31] <vrlogrs> the piece/image is getting in the way of the mouseup function event
[14:44:37] <john-dev> ah, i see
[14:45:17] <vrlogrs> any ideas?
[14:45:20] <GunMan`> @shoky : see link via PM
[14:45:41] <vrlogrs> i commented out line 346 in chess.js
[14:45:57] <vrlogrs> if i keep that in, the piece is always under the mouse, and so you cant drop the piece on a square
[14:45:57] <john-dev> puh, hard to say..
[14:46:19] <shoky> GunMan`: i fixed what i told you.   '.delete_button'   NOT '.delete-button'
[14:46:52] <shoky> GunMan`: you already put the link on the channel ;]
[14:46:57] <shoky> fyi
[14:47:00] <vrlogrs> somehow, the image needs to be click-throughable .. or it needs to disappear right before the mouseup event gets called so the mouse can detect the proper square
[14:47:12] <vrlogrs> this is sooo frustratign
[14:48:02] <john-dev> vrlogrs, please uncommend that line
[14:48:16] <GunMan`> Wow, it works fine right now !
[14:48:17] <vrlogrs> done -- u can refresh to get it
[14:48:38] <vrlogrs> see how the image is always in the way
[14:48:39] <GunMan`> Sorry, I may have miscopied it
[14:48:45] <vrlogrs> u cant drop the piece properly
[14:48:50] <GunMan`> @shoky, could you explain me what was wrong exactly ?
[14:48:51] <john-dev> i see
[14:48:57] <shoky> GunMan`:  wrong class name..?
[14:49:01] <john-dev> puh, hard to dive into that code..
[14:49:18] <john-dev> GunMan`, you used button_ instead of button-
[14:49:25] <vrlogrs> lines 338 is the function
[14:50:17] <vrlogrs> is there any way to make it so that the mouseup functions goes through that image?
[14:50:24] <vrlogrs> or make the image click-throughable?
[14:50:26] <enderx86> okay, i think i need to use jsonp for this. i want to do an ajax request on localhost:5000
[14:50:27] <john-dev> well vrlogrs doesnt look like jquery ti me..
[14:50:29] <vrlogrs> or make it disappear right before
[14:50:31] <enderx86> how should i go about doing the jsonp?
[14:50:34] <GunMan`> no, I meant, what's the difference between $("#update_div").on("click", ".delete_button" ... and $("#delete_button").on("click", function ....
[14:50:36] <enderx86> with $.getJSON()?
[14:50:40] <john-dev> vrlogrs, maybe with z-index?
[14:50:56] <vrlogrs> z-index will hide the image from us
[14:51:00] <vrlogrs> we need to be able to see it
[14:51:39] <vrlogrs> how would i do it with jquery? it'd be the same event
[14:52:03] <vrlogrs> unless jquery has some magical function to make the image click-throughable :P
[14:52:59] <john-dev> well what i meant is, this is the wrong channel..
[14:53:17] <vrlogrs> i tried javascript -- i was there for the past several hours with no luck
[14:53:28] <vrlogrs> was hoping you guys might have a different perspective/solution
[14:53:33] <john-dev> hmh..
[14:53:50] <vrlogrs> this doesnt seem like a difficult problem, yet it is
[14:53:53] <GunMan`> @shoky, check PM
[14:55:36] <vrlogrs> lich
[14:56:15] <vrlogrs> like lichess.org has the dragging pieces
[14:56:19] <vrlogrs> and it's working fine
[14:56:29] <vrlogrs> even with the image in teh way of the mouse and the square
[14:56:30] <john-dev> hm, shouldnt img.style.left = (event.clientX - yoffset) + "px"; be img.style.left = (event.clientX - xoffset) + "px";
[14:56:49] <john-dev> so xoffset instead of yoffset?
[14:57:18] <vrlogrs> john, yoffset and xoffset are the same
[14:57:25] <vrlogrs> the image is a square
[14:57:33] <vrlogrs> either way, the image is in the way
[14:58:17] <GunMan`> (Thanks for the help guys ! really appreciate it :) ) !
[14:58:21] <john-dev> ok, cant figure out what belongs to what
[14:58:33] <vrlogrs> what do u mean?
[14:58:34] <andrewtaylor> Hi. How do I do a JSONP?
[15:00:11] <enderx86> How do I do a JSONP?
[15:00:15] <john-dev> http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/
[15:00:19] <john-dev> @ enderx86
[15:00:26] <enderx86> Thanks john-dev
[15:00:34] <john-dev> sure!
[15:01:07] <john-dev> vrlogrs, do me a favor and switch line 346 with line 347
[15:01:20] <vrlogrs> done
[15:01:50] <john-dev> now uncomment line 346
[15:02:06] <vrlogrs> so im uncommenting img.style.top ?
[15:02:16] <john-dev> y
[15:02:19] <vrlogrs> done
[15:02:29] <john-dev> aha
[15:02:30] <vrlogrs> see, it works
[15:02:36] <john-dev> well, "works" :-)
[15:02:37] <vrlogrs> because the image is not in the way
[15:02:39] <relipse>  i have about 20 select boxes, they all have the same options, I want it so that when one option is selected, it disappears out of the other 19 select boxes
[15:02:44] <relipse> is this an easy task?
[15:02:49] <vrlogrs> the image gets in teh way
[15:03:12] <john-dev> relipse, $.each
[15:03:21] <relipse> $.each what?
[15:03:36] <john-dev> use http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[15:04:19] <john-dev> i asume they all have the at least the same class or id.. or some other identifier so they can get selected
[15:05:00] <john-dev> vrlogrs, i dont think i get it.. well i see the problem but it i dont know why this happens..
[15:05:14] <vrlogrs> so, it's not normal?
[15:05:41] <vrlogrs> line 186
[15:05:48] <vrlogrs> that's where the events are defined
[15:06:08] <vrlogrs> called at lines 451 - 470
[15:06:15] <john-dev> there is something strange
[15:06:38] <john-dev> if i refresh the page and pick a field first, the images jumps over the top of the chess field
[15:06:52] <john-dev> after that, it keeps in the line..
[15:07:04] <shoky> relipse: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/CcMUE/
[15:07:59] <enderx86> john-dev: that link you gives me set {jsonp: 'jsonp_callback'}. does that mean i need a jsonp_callback function in my javascript?
[15:09:17] <shoky> enderx86: nope
[15:09:57] <vrlogrs> opacity doesnt work either
[15:10:13] <vrlogrs> it just makes a slightly transparent img, but still in the way of the mouse
[15:10:24] <relipse> shoky: wow thanks
[15:10:36] <prasanth_g> any suggestions for a banner(sequentially/randomly) rotator on page refresh, the banner is not just an image, it will be a javascript code
[15:10:47] <john-dev> relipse, sry i read checkboxes.. my bad..
[15:10:48] <relipse> shoky: but i would need the values back in if the user selected a different one
[15:11:05] <shoky> relipse: that's another thing ;]
[15:11:25] <relipse> would i need a global array?
[15:11:47] <john-dev> vrlogrs, sry but i dont know the answer..
[15:11:48] <relipse> i'm aamazed at how fast you did it using jquery, i think i wasted much time trying to do it my way
[15:11:52] <john-dev> cant dive into it all..
[15:12:01] <shoky> relipse: well you could .hide() the option instead of .remove()ing it, and then you'd just need to .show() it
[15:12:03] <vrlogrs> :'(
[15:12:04] <enderx86> what's wrong with this (brief) jsonp code... http://pastebin.com/CK4iAEp9
[15:12:11] <shoky> relipse: but a global array works too
[15:12:23] <vrlogrs> can somebody just show me how they would do this
[15:12:28] <vrlogrs> if they did it themselves
[15:12:31] <vrlogrs> using whatever
[15:12:34] <relipse> oh yeah .hide() sounds good
[15:12:41] <relipse> that way they are still in there
[15:12:56] <vrlogrs> simple dragging and dropping
[15:13:01] <vrlogrs> of imgs over divs
[15:13:26] <shoky> enderx86: xhr.done(function(data) { $('div').html(data) })
[15:14:23] <john-dev> and line 15 remove that ,
[15:15:06] <shoky> enderx86: also you probably don't need that  jsonp: 'jsonp_callback'
[15:15:22] <shoky> unles your server specifically looks for a jsonp_callback param..?
[15:15:24] <prasanth_g> any script?
[15:16:25] <vrlogrs> can i have an event where instead of the mouse hovering over a div, i look for an image over a div?
[15:16:38] <relipse> shoky: do i need to encode your .find() statement
[15:16:45] <relipse> $(this).val()
[15:16:51] <prasanth_g> any script?
[15:16:52] <shoky> enderx86: but your server has to support JSONP too..
[15:17:32] <shoky> relipse: depends what the possible values are, i guess..
[15:17:50] <vrlogrs> if there is a god, he needs to be punished
[15:17:50] <relipse> well for safety reasons
[15:18:05] <relipse> god only does good, he's done nothing wrong
[15:18:34] <vrlogrs> he has, by having me waste an entire day on what seems like a trivial problem
[15:18:41] <enderx86> shoky: still not working
[15:18:45] <vrlogrs> and nobody being able to find a solution :(
[15:18:52] <shoky> enderx86: see the last thing i said to you
[15:18:54] <relipse> wow thats hilarious, you just blamed God on what you did
[15:19:00] <vrlogrs> lol
[15:19:05] <vrlogrs> just that kind of a day
[15:20:03] <vrlogrs> can anyone help out?
[15:20:08] <enderx86> shoky: how do i find out whether my server supports jsonp?
[15:21:38] <adamo> what is jsonp?
[15:21:50] <shoky> enderx86: that would depend on what your server is
[15:22:02] <enderx86> it's an apache httpd server
[15:22:07] <enderx86> the kind that comes with os x :-)
[15:22:09] <john-dev> JSONP is script tag injection, passing the response from the server in to a user specified function
[15:22:11] <enderx86> i'm running it on localhost
[15:22:29] <shoky> uh.. what does the URL return..?
[15:22:37] <shoky> the one you're calling with ajax
[15:22:44] <relipse> shocky: anyway, how would i make it safe with like jqueryentities() or romse function
[15:22:47] <shoky> it just serves a static file?
[15:23:08] <shoky> relipse: no idea what those are.. and i'm not the guy to ask about security shit ;p
[15:23:17] <enderx86> Console shows that the GET request failed
[15:23:38] <john-dev> relipse, you need a server side validation anyway later on..
[15:23:42] <enderx86> I'm connecting to my Python web server on port 5000
[15:23:42] <shoky> enderx86: but you chose the URL.. is it just a link to a static file..?
[15:23:51] <shoky> enderx86: ok so not just apache..
[15:23:54] <enderx86> It's not exactly a 'static' file....
[15:24:01] <enderx86> It's dynamically generated by a python webapp
[15:24:08] <shoky> enderx86: right, that's what i was asking about
[15:24:09] <relipse> shoky: ok well anyway, can you help me code a version of what you posted that puts the original values back in
[15:24:29] <john-dev> relipse, use an array for that case..
[15:24:32] <shoky> enderx86: then you need to figure out how to do JSON with python and whatever web framework you're using
[15:24:32] <enderx86> Basically I'm trying to find a way to integrate a Python webapp on port 5000 with a jQuery page on port 80
[15:24:37] <shoky> JSONP*
[15:24:46] <enderx86> I don't want to really use/rely on web frameworks...
[15:24:49] <shoky> enderx86: or better yet, do CORS instead of JSONP
[15:24:53] <enderx86> I just wanted to use this Python webapp for one part of my website
[15:25:08] <shoky> enderx86: to enable CORS is simple and it's standard, not a hack like JSONP.
[15:25:12] <shoky> ?g enable CORS @ enderx86
[15:25:13] <bot-t> enderx86, enable CORS - http://enable-cors.org/
[15:25:37] <rmurphey> you could also have your main server (at port 80) proxy requests to your python app
[15:25:59] <rmurphey> so you make your requests to your main server, and it hits the python app, gets the data, and sends it back to you
[15:26:59] <john-dev> shoky, he is using a custom python framework.. there is possible no support..
[15:27:19] <shoky> there is always support for adding http headers..no?
[15:27:33] <vrlogrs> what about lines 318-337?
[15:27:37] <vrlogrs> could that be a problem?
[15:28:43] <vrlogrs> http://www.funnode.com/chess
[15:29:03] <vrlogrs> in chess.js
[15:30:18] <shoky> relipse: just noticed what you asked.. how about you fiddle with the fiddle i made you and try to get it working.. then show me what you tried
[15:32:50] <vrlogrs> ...
[15:33:29] <john-dev> vrlogrs, you might should try it tomorrow..
[15:33:50] <vrlogrs> :(
[15:35:58] <vrlogrs> see, right now
[15:36:00] <vrlogrs> it works
[15:36:16] <vrlogrs> because i offset the image so that it doesnt get in the way of the mouse
[15:37:04] <adamo> ?
[15:37:14] <adamo> so you have your problem fixed?
[15:37:49] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take a five minute break
[15:38:05] <vrlogrs> adamo: no
[15:38:12] <vrlogrs> cause the image is supposed to be under the pointer
[15:38:17] <vrlogrs> not to the side of it
[15:38:24] <vrlogrs> if you see it, u'll know what i mean
[15:42:13] <relipse> shoky: lol i was going to do it my way
[15:42:21] <relipse> i can't fiddle with your fiddle its all jquery
[15:42:36] <relipse> and i dont have jquery memorized
[15:43:34] <tw2113> i would hope not, that's a lot to memorize
[15:46:15] <wmfx> Hello everyone ! anyone work with dreamweaver and jquery??
[15:46:27] <wmfx> i have a question for you
[15:47:52] <astropirate> wmfx, don't use dream weaver :O
[15:48:01] <wmfx> Im trying to host jquery on my dev box and make reference to it like one would do google but it's not working
[15:48:28] <wmfx> I know but I gotta
[15:49:06] <sunbeam> i've got 10 anchors in (".list li a") they are in the a links, i want to preload all these images
[15:49:07] <relipse> in jquery how do i get all select options where value equals "foo" or "bar" ?
[15:49:09] <sunbeam> any idea how i can do this best?
[15:49:11] <wmfx> I started out with note pad then html kit then it just progresses
[15:50:48] <prasanth_g> i had seen many banner rotating scripts but only with image codes, how to replace image code with banner js code?
[15:51:53] <sunbeam> when  ihave a list, <ul><li><a href="#"></a></li><li><a href="#"></a></li></ul> and the second <a> is clicked, how can i check which count is is (the 2nd)
[15:52:20] <vrlogrs> alright, im gonna call it quits for today ... thanks to everyone who helped -- much appreciated
[15:55:30] <enderx86> To enable CORS, do I just add 'Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin *' to my httpd.conf file?
[15:55:44] <enderx86> If not httpd.conf, where do I put it?
[16:17:51] <coldhead>  /join #w4r3z
[16:23:51] <sunbeam> i've got 10 anchors in (".list li a") they are in the a links, i want to preload all these images
[16:23:56] <sunbeam> how can i best accomplish this, anyone
[16:24:24] <relipse> would $("option[value=foo|bar]") find every option with value ="foo" or value = "bar" ?
[16:28:01] <coldhead> no relipse
[16:28:08] <relipse> how do i say "OR"
[16:28:48] <coldhead> $('option[value="foo"],option[value="bar"]')
[16:29:21] <relipse> ok thanks
[16:29:26] <relipse> why the quotes?
[16:29:32] <relipse> cant you just do value=bar
[16:29:34] <relipse> or value=foo
[16:30:31] <coldhead> no you can't
[16:30:37] <coldhead> the quotes are mandatory
[16:30:40] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[16:30:47] <coldhead> sunbeam: http://jsfiddle.net/xtjxF/
[16:30:56] * tw2113 needs mandatory things
[16:31:03] <tw2113> hold me coldhead
[16:31:12] <coldhead> i am no woman
[16:31:16] <coldhead> AND THAT'S NO MOON
[16:32:17] <rmurphey> coldhead: my favorite thing about you showing up on sunday nights is that it's monday morning where you are
[16:32:55] <rmurphey> and yet you act like it is still sunday night
[16:33:18] <sunbeam> coldhead: amazing
[16:33:19] <tw2113> you mean it's not sunday night for coldhead sometimes?
[16:33:25] <tw2113> i thought he was stuck in a time warp
[16:33:35] <rmurphey> i think it is always monday where he is
[16:33:37] <rmurphey> just before lunch
[16:33:48] <tw2113> pre or post coffee rm
[16:33:51] <tw2113> rmurphey*
[16:34:37] <rmurphey> hard to say
[16:35:04] <coldhead> it's always before lunch and coffee
[16:35:13] <coldhead> perpetual monday morning horror
[16:36:18] <tw2113> and on top of it all, it's your first day with jquery
[16:36:20] <tw2113> #horror
[16:36:39] <coldhead> jQuery has been the redeeming feature of the horror so far
[16:36:52] <coldhead> jQuery and saline injections
[16:37:00] <coldhead> for full pouty lips
[16:37:09] <sunbeam> A question, how come there is always some padding added below an img? anyone nkows
[16:37:16] <sunbeam> even though i disabled padding
[16:37:47] <tw2113> did you do this? img { padding 0 } ?
[16:38:02] <tw2113> with the right use of :'s
[16:41:23] <sunbeam> had to use display: block for img{}
[16:41:26] <sunbeam> damn never heard that
[16:41:36] <coldhead> CSS is hard
[16:43:00] <relipse> does anyone know in JSFIDDLE how to get to the console?
[16:43:16] <coldhead> debugger;
[16:43:16] <relipse> i am trying chrome's console, but its not working
[16:44:05] <relipse> what is that supposed to mean
[16:44:06] <tw2113> i'll show you something hard coldhead
[16:44:14] <relipse> i dont even see the word "debugger" in jsfiddle
[16:44:31] <tw2113> this is hard coldhead http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7e/Die_hard.jpg/220px-Die_hard.jpg
[16:45:38] <coldhead> relipse: add debugger; to the end of your code
[16:46:04] <coldhead> when the code runs, the debugger will pop open. hey presto: consoley goodness
[16:48:45] <relipse> yeah but I need the console to be available as it is being run
[16:49:01] <relipse> so i can check the values of select boxes and whatnot
[16:49:10] <relipse> for some reason it wont let you have a global variable
[16:49:35] <rmurphey> relipse: a debugger statement pauses execution
[16:49:52] <rmurphey> and then you can look at any variable you want, either by mousing over it in the sources tab, or by setting a watch expression
[16:52:01] <tw2113> basically built in breakpoints for jsfiddle?
[16:53:48] <relipse> yeah i just found that out
[16:53:54] <coldhead> relipse: try appending /show/ to the end of your jsfiddle URL, then you can ditch all the iframes and the console should behave as usual
[16:53:56] <relipse> but i'd rather just have console availability
[16:54:11] <relipse> ok thanks coldhead
[16:55:14] <coldhead> hi EmmaJ
[17:04:57] <relipse> shoky: you there?
[17:05:06] <relipse> ok shoky i took your example and modified it
[17:05:13] <relipse> quite a bit
[17:05:18] <relipse> i need you to help me though
[17:05:43] <coldhead> bot-t: tell EmmaJ I will never forget you
[17:05:43] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[17:06:58] <wmfx> Hi, any one know how to get jquery to work on my computer/development box like it would as if I was referencing it from goggle??
[17:07:44] <shoky> relipse: here
[17:09:01] <tw2113> wmfx, <script type='text/javascript' src='jquery.js'></script>
[17:09:20] <shoky> relipse: in chrome console, click where it says <top frame> and you can select the right frame
[17:09:50] <shoky> you want the result frame
[17:10:55] <wmfx> I downloaded the latest version and placed it a directory and referenced it but it didnt work for me
[17:11:27] <shoky> ?doesn't work
[17:11:28] <tw2113> how did you test it to make sure?
[17:11:47] <relipse> ok thanks shoky
[17:11:58] <wmfx> just did a preview in dreamweaver
[17:12:14] <wmfx> and it didnt show
[17:13:21] <shoky> "it"?
[17:13:24] <wmfx> this is on my development computer and it never get hooked to the internet
[17:13:42] <rmurphey> wmfx: how did you reference it?
[17:14:01] <rmurphey> also are you running your site via a server or loading static files or .. ?
[17:15:40] <wmfx> <script type='text/javascript' src=news/jquery-1.8.2.js></script>
[17:16:19] <rmurphey> wmfx: does your server know how to serve a file from the news dir, relative to the html page you are trying to load the script from?
[17:16:23] <wmfx> I saved the the jquery-1.8.2.js to a folder
[17:16:41] <wmfx> probably not
[17:17:18] <wmfx> I dont know how to do do that yet
[17:17:49] <rmurphey> wmfx: what is preventing you from getting this dev machine connected to the internet?
[17:17:56] <wmfx> no
[17:18:04] <rmurphey> because chances are we are not going to be able to really help you at the level it seems you are going to need help
[17:18:17] <wmfx> It a dedicated production machine
[17:18:25] <wmfx> no internet
[17:18:54] <coldhead> clean room
[17:19:28] <shoky> wmfx: are you getting an error? is your code not running? what is the problem..?
[17:19:30] <wmfx> so Im trying to reference the downloaded jquery-1.8.2.js from within a folder within
[17:19:42] <wmfx> code not running
[17:20:19] <shoky> pastebin your html and code
[17:20:45] <wmfx> ok give me a sec
[17:20:49] <shoky> and answer rmurphey's questions
[17:21:32] <bonhoeffer> if i have $('#example').popover(options) -- and i have an option 'html' which is a boolean, how would i pass that
[17:22:09] <shoky> bonhoeffer: .popover({html: true}) ?
[17:22:13] <bonhoeffer> i thought $('#example').popover({html: true})
[17:22:19] <bonhoeffer> hmm. . . this is not working
[17:22:39] <shoky> then that's not how the plugin is used ;p
[17:22:47] <bonhoeffer> but that is what i thought -- so my problem must be elsewhere
[17:23:02] <bonhoeffer> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#popovers
[17:23:05] <shoky> the problem might be in your understanding of the plugin API
[17:24:07] <shoky> scratch that ;p
[17:26:10] <wmfx> I think  I juuuuuust got it
[17:26:37] <wmfx> file path was incorrect
[17:27:10] <wmfx> Thanks shoky
[17:29:00] <tw2113> what? no credit to rmurphey too wmfx ?
[17:29:14] <wmfx> Oh but of course
[17:29:30] <coldhead> mr murphey doesn't care about no credit
[17:29:32] <wmfx> rmurphey  was awesome as well
[17:29:40] <wmfx> without doubt.
[17:30:30] <wmfx> without you guys i would probably would thrown my monitor in the floor
[17:30:59] <tw2113> economic stimulus?
[17:31:07] <tw2113> at least in the keynesian model
[17:31:28] <wmfx> rmurphey is super cool as well as he stepped up earlier to help me
[17:31:55] <tw2113> despite what coldhead will eventually say
[17:32:03] <tw2113> rmurphey, is actually carrying 2 X chromosomes
[17:32:15] <shoky> both delightful
[17:32:51] <tw2113> smooth shoky
[17:33:01] <wmfx> :)
[17:35:44] <coldhead> i think you guys are talking about someone else
[17:39:34] <Alpha64> http://i.imgur.com/qB4GT.png why is this happening?
[17:43:13] <coldhead> the element with the scrollbar probably has a fixed height
[17:43:17] <coldhead> instead of height:auto
[17:43:26] <coldhead> or height:'something very big'
[17:46:07] <mdedetrich> this is a question regarding performance
[17:46:21] <mdedetrich> if you do a selector that selects over multiple elements
[17:46:42] <mdedetrich> i.e. $('.someClass') and it happens to hit a lot of elements in the DOM
[17:46:59] <mdedetrich> and you attach an event, i.e. $('.someClass').click(â€¦..)
[17:47:15] <mdedetrich> will jquery create a function for every element, or does it do something smarter?
[17:47:26] <mdedetrich> in terms of memory use
[17:47:58] <coldhead> every element, mdedetrich
[17:48:10] <coldhead> this is why you want to move to use ?on
[17:48:21] <coldhead> oh, thanks for nothing bot-t
[17:48:31] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[17:48:42] <coldhead> then you can use delegation and bubbling and do it smarter
[17:49:09] <mdedetrich> coldhead: ah, so on will only create one function
[17:49:19] <mdedetrich> coldhead: is there a tut for this?
[17:49:32] <lolhii> contenteditable <-- this creates odd behavior on mozilla, any way I can use jquery to  convert new lines from br / div / p to \n ?
[17:49:34] <Alpha64> they all have heightStyle: auto
[17:49:46] <Alpha64> "auto"
[17:49:52] <lolhii> here's what im using to do that, http://pastie.org/5186729
[17:50:02] <lolhii> but it's buggy
[17:50:05] <mdedetrich> coldhead: or is it literally just this code
[17:50:08] <mdedetrich> $("#dataTable tbody tr").on("click", function(event){
[17:50:08] <mdedetrich> 	alert($(this).text());
[17:50:08] <mdedetrich> });
[17:50:59] <coldhead> there is more to it, mdedetrich
[17:51:39] <coldhead> http://jqueryfordesigners.com/simple-use-of-event-delegation/
[17:51:49] <coldhead> http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2012/04/jquery-1-7-event-binding-on-and-off
[17:51:52] <coldhead> those seem decent
[17:53:32] <mdedetrich> coldhead: If I am using jquery 1.8.2, I use .on instead right
[17:55:10] <coldhead> yes
[17:56:55] <relipse> jslint says there is something wrong with this line: for (var k in GLB_HIDDEN) {
[17:57:13] <snover> thatâ€™s nice, dear
[17:57:15] <relipse> GLB_HIDDEN is an object
[17:57:45] <coldhead> what does jshint say?
[17:57:52] <relipse> umm what is jshint?
[17:57:57] <snover> yeah coldhead
[17:57:58] <snover> what is that
[17:58:06] <coldhead> let's all google it together
[17:58:31] <mdedetrich> coldhead: awesome, thanks heaps, that worked
[17:58:36] <mdedetrich> coldhead: learn something new every day
[17:58:51] <coldhead> mdedetrich: i try
[17:59:34] <mdedetrich> I never did event delegation before this, I just created an event on every single element, which would have very obvious performance implications
[17:59:58] <coldhead> usually you can get away it it
[18:00:05] <relipse> The body of a for in should be wrapped in an if statement to filter unwanted properties from the prototype.
[18:01:03] <relipse> coldhead
[18:01:06] <relipse> thats what it says
[18:01:08] <relipse> i dont understand
[18:02:27] <coldhead> how much do you know about prototypal inheritance, relipse ?
[18:03:32] <coldhead> relipse: this looks like a good explanation http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/04/exploring-javascript-for-in-loops/
[18:03:47] <coldhead> the bit about hasOwnProperty is probably what you're in trouble with jslint for
[18:06:03] <snover> whatâ€™s prototypal mean
[18:06:18] <snover> also i thought an angus was a kind of cow
[18:07:00] <mdedetrich> coldhead: do you know if backbone does event delegation?
[18:07:41] <relipse> ok fine so what should i do, not use for..in...
[18:07:56] <relipse> i need to iterate through all keys in an object
[18:15:31] <Johnson_> is it valid to submit 2 forms.. one inside the other one?
[18:15:57] <coldhead> it doesn't sound very valid, does it
[18:16:05] <relipse> shoky, you alive?
[18:17:35] <relipse> shoky, here is what i did with the code: http://jsfiddle.net/CcMUE/7/ , it seems to work fine except randomly it will not work (have a value that should be hidden, can you play with it a little)
[18:17:49] <Johnson_> the thing is that i have 2 tabs with diferent diferent information
[18:18:51] <coldhead> like liquid gets into this chalk
[18:19:28] <relipse> can someone please help me, i'm trying to come up with an interface to allow select boxes with the same options to hide options that are selected by other select boxes, please feel free to contribute http://jsfiddle.net/CcMUE/7/
[18:20:32] <relipse> if possible we could make it into a jquery plugin
[18:21:13] <brend_> dblosevn:  is the man here
[18:21:58] <Jortuny> howdy. anyone know if it's possible to select based on a wildcard for attributes? like, select all elements having an attribute starting with "foo-bar-"?
[18:23:14] <coldhead> you can select values by wildcard http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[18:23:20] <coldhead> not so much attribute
[18:23:29] <relipse> what do you mean?
[18:24:32] <coldhead> $('[some-attr^="foo-bar"]') works if some-attr is always some-attr
[18:24:35] <Jortuny> yea, i looked through those. it seemed like they all had to do with attribute values
[18:24:41] <coldhead> right
[18:24:46] <Jortuny> i want to select on the name
[18:24:50] <coldhead> i understand
[18:24:57] <coldhead> this is why i am saying "not so much"
[18:24:59] <Jortuny> :(
[18:25:04] <Jortuny> lame
[18:25:13] <coldhead> maybe your attributes are lame
[18:25:19] <Jortuny> right now, i'm concatenating a long list of possible attributes
[18:25:21] <coldhead> and jQuery is a beautiful princess
[18:25:30] <Jortuny> why can't we all just be friends
[18:25:30] <coldhead> you can use filter()
[18:25:33] <coldhead> and do it yourself
[18:25:37] <coldhead> without too much trouble
[18:25:42] <coldhead> it will be slow but it can be done
[18:25:44] <Jortuny> sure
[18:25:51] <Jortuny> it's just a lot slower than some native code
[18:25:58] <Jortuny> i was just seeing if i was missing something silly
[18:26:08] <coldhead> no, it's not a common use case
[18:26:48] <Jortuny> ok. an unrelated other question, is it possible to select all children that aren't themselves children of some selector?
[18:27:29] <coldhead> there isn't a neat selector for that
[18:27:36] <coldhead> but again you could do it with filter()
[18:27:39] <coldhead> and closest()
[18:27:40] <Jortuny> yea, thought as much
[18:27:44] <Jortuny> i'm using closest right now
[18:27:49] <Jortuny> but it feels dirty and i hate myself
[18:27:54] <coldhead> i hate your markup
[18:28:06] <Jortuny> my markup is too awesome for jquery
[18:28:11] <Jortuny> is the primary problem it seems
[18:28:12] <coldhead> :D
[18:28:31] <coldhead> well your attributes for example, i never use custom ones
[18:28:38] <coldhead> so i never face your seletor problem
[18:29:06] <Jortuny> yea i'm kinda designing a new system that has a few data-foo-bar kinda deals
[18:29:20] <tw2113> data attributes are fine
[18:29:26] <Jortuny> so it would be nice to be able to query for everything e.g. data-foo-baz and data-foo-bar
[18:29:48] <tw2113> data('foo-bar');
[18:30:02] <Jortuny> yah but you can't do [data-foo-*]
[18:30:08] <coldhead> i would probably code something to add classes that matches the data-whatever-attr-names
[18:30:13] <coldhead> so i could select on them easily
[18:30:29] <Jortuny> yea. that's a good point. right now i have one attribute (data-foo) on every one of them
[18:30:38] <Jortuny> so i can do a simple selector
[18:30:48] <Jortuny> but i would like to not have that, as it seems redundant
[18:31:20] <tw2113> i felt elation and a sense of awesomeness when i found a good use for data-attributes a couple weeks back
[18:31:42] <coldhead> you young people with your zest for life
[18:31:44] <coldhead> so inspiring
[18:32:22] <Jortuny> i am slowly losing zest with how jquery wants me not to have my awesome markup
[18:32:59] <coldhead> Jortuny: jquery's selector engine is easily extended. you could write a plugin to support attr selectors
[18:33:02] <tw2113> jquery doesn't care until you start using jquery to select parts of it
[18:33:05] <coldhead> and it would look Just Like The Real Thing
[18:33:16] <Jortuny> coldhead: is it easily extended? that would be fun
[18:33:16] <coldhead> and people would celebrate your life
[18:33:20] <coldhead> in song and stained glass
[18:33:30] <Jortuny> i didn't know stained glass was involved. sign me up
[18:33:58] <coldhead> Jortuny: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/
[18:34:09] <coldhead> that's a similar idea, to let you match by regex
[18:34:17] <coldhead> hopefully that will show you the principle
[18:34:27] <Jortuny> wooo
[18:34:46] <coldhead> oh this is fuller http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/extending-jquerys-selector-capabilities/
[18:35:33] <hye> hi I am using jquery mobile and I do this to display a dialog:  $.mobile.changePage('someotherfolder/blah.html');   but when I go to that page and then go back via a dialog button... the links on the previous page start using 'someotherfolder' as their root and it breaks my links, any ideas?
[18:37:02] <Jortuny> thanks coldhead, i'm gonna give this a shot
[18:38:57] <coldhead> good luck, Jortuny! i hope it lets you write beautiful selectors
[18:41:47] <relipse> shoky, anyone, can someone please tell me why this is http://jsfiddle.net/CcMUE/7/ not working after juggling values a bit?
[18:44:37] <hye> okay just for anyone tuned in to my question, i added a "changeHash: false" to the .changePage function and it doesn't break my links anymore...
[18:52:33] <FearMoth> hi, is there any way to enable/disable a form field so it won't be submitted, besides adding/removing the field to the dom?
[19:04:39] <black_warlock> how can i set every parents ul display blocked , if a <li> has class selected ?
[19:05:21] <black_warlock> $('li.selected').parent('ul').css('display','block')
[19:05:38] <black_warlock> nm
[19:05:42] <black_warlock> it was parents
[19:05:46] <black_warlock> not parent :D
[19:10:27] <ms99999> Is there away to go to the next anchor on a page without knowing an anchor name? Just going to whatever anchor is next?
[19:14:23] <brend_>  i need to process 2 forms in different tabs.. how can i remove the submit buttons from the first tab  in the second tab  http://jsfiddle.net/YHS4G/
[19:18:28] <relipse> i think i fixed it!, i just stored the lastvalue even if it was '' check it out, can you comment on my code: http://jsfiddle.net/CcMUE/8/
[19:18:36] <coldhead> brend_: http://jsfiddle.net/YHS4G/1/
[19:19:15] <CapMax> how to change value of hidden?]
[19:19:21] <CapMax> by using it's selector
[19:19:27] <CapMax> $('#id').???
[19:20:02] <relipse> .hide()
[19:20:03] <relipse> lol
[19:20:07] <relipse> .show()
[19:20:23] <brend_> coldhead:  if u go to the empleados tab.. u will see down that im getting the submit buttons twice
[19:21:10] <fonko> hey guys
[19:21:30] <fonko> im having some issues related to jquery ajax and json, hope someone of you can clearme out some doubts
[19:22:26] <coldhead> brend_: your html is terrible
[19:22:30] <relipse> bring it on fonko
[19:22:32] <coldhead> you shouldn't nest the forms
[19:22:36] <coldhead> that's crazy
[19:22:45] <brend_> coldhead: what im suppose to change there?
[19:22:52] <coldhead> change the html
[19:23:01] <coldhead> put each form in a separate tabcontent div
[19:23:11] <coldhead> don't put a form inside another form
[19:23:27] <coldhead> i don't even know if that will fix it but it will fix the issue of nesting forms
[19:23:35] <brend_> coldhead:  but i need both forms.. in the same tabbable section.. so im confused there
[19:23:58] <coldhead> do you need the forms to be nested?
[19:24:02] <coldhead> no, no you don't
[19:24:04] <coldhead> no one needs that
[19:24:23] <coldhead> your html has a <form> declared with the .tabs() stuff within it
[19:24:25] <coldhead> it shouldn't
[19:24:28] <CapMax> how to change value of hidden?]
[19:24:34] <CapMax> or any input
[19:24:35] <CapMax> reallyt
[19:24:37] <coldhead> you either want separate forms inside the tabs
[19:24:42] <coldhead> OR a single form
[19:25:11] <coldhead> CapMax: $('#some_id').val('some new val');
[19:28:35] <fonko> relipse, i tought i had it but nop... ok here it comes
[19:29:00] <fonko> im sending thorugh jquery and ajax a response back to my php, it has a huge json variable
[19:29:08] <brend_> coldhead: so it should be something like this http://jsfiddle.net/7e5TR/ but im not getting the second form in the second tab
[19:29:26] <fonko> but im getting it like this
[19:29:26] <fonko> ll,\"in_reply_to_user_id_str\":null,\"in_reply_to_screen_name\":null,\"user\":{\"id\":926360216,\"id_str\":\"926360216\"},\"geo\":null,\"coordinates\":null,\"place\":null,\"contributors\":null,\"retweet_count\":0,\"favorited\":false,\"retweeted\":false},{\"created_at\":\"Sun Nov 04 23:09:29 +0000 2012\",\"id\":265229309080395776,\"id_str\":\"265229309080395776\",\"text\":\"prueba 2 21:09\",\"source

[19:29:54] <fonko> i need a real json variable so i can iterate
[19:30:42] <relipse> yeah looks like its escaping all the quotes
[19:30:50] <relipse> you could always run unescape on the string
[19:31:01] <fonko> from my php file?
[19:31:05] <relipse> right
[19:31:22] <sriyani> hi, i used window.alert('message') for display warning message, i want to show it middle of browser window, firefox show it middle and chrome show it top of window, how can i fix it?
[19:31:24] <relipse> or just use a regular expression to convert \" to "
[19:31:32] <CapMax> coldhead: ty
[19:31:34] <fonko> because im getting json format
[19:31:40] <fonko> from twitter
[19:31:41] <fonko> $data = file_get_contents('http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.json?screen_name='. $this->_screenName .'&include_rts=1&trim_user=1&count=' . $limit
[19:31:44] <relipse> sriyani: what does that have to do with jquery
[19:31:58] <fonko> then i go with json_encode
[19:32:09] <fonko> and then i through that to my jquery ajax response
[19:32:11] <relipse> oh i see, so look at the data in chrome debug tool and see if its real json
[19:32:24] <relipse> you mean json_decode() ?
[19:32:25] <fonko> thats what chrome debug tool shows
[19:32:34] <fonko> console.log(response);
[19:32:59] <sriyani> relipse, how can i show message box middle in browser window?
[19:32:59] <fonko> lol, im using encode
[19:33:23] <relipse> ok i just checked a twitter url
[19:33:29] <relipse> and it is escaping the "
[19:33:32] <relipse> why, i dont know
[19:33:40] <relipse> but you'll need to use str_replace()
[19:33:45] <relipse> to get rid of it
[19:34:11] <fonko> in order to have a real json array in my response?
[19:34:15] <relipse> wait a second
[19:34:18] <relipse> no its not
[19:34:25] <relipse> here go to http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.json?screen_name=paulwasher
[19:34:31] <relipse> look at the json
[19:34:33] <relipse> its normal
[19:34:41] <relipse> you should be able to file_get_contents() that url pretty easily
[19:34:55] <relipse> and then json_decode(file_get_contents(...))
[19:35:02] <relipse> into a php object or whatever
[19:35:18] <tw2113> i wonder how long we'll be able to access our data with that endpoint
[19:35:41] <fonko> in the case that i have a json object from my client side
[19:35:43] <fonko> i mean
[19:35:49] <fonko> when ajax brings the info its json
[19:35:56] <fonko> how should i run through it?
[19:36:09] <relipse> oh use the jquery ajax() to turn it into json
[19:36:11] <fonko> iterate
[19:36:19] <relipse> i'll find example one sec
[19:36:25] <fonko> awesome :)
[19:36:26] <fonko> you rock
[19:36:43] <tw2113> https://github.com/tw2113/tweetQuery/blob/master/tweetquery-000051.js
[19:36:46] <tw2113> from my own plugin
[19:36:47] <relipse> $.ajax({
[19:36:47] <relipse>   url: url,
[19:36:47] <relipse>   dataType: 'json',
[19:36:47] <relipse>   data: data,
[19:36:47] <relipse>   success: callback
[19:36:47] <relipse> });
[19:37:13] <relipse> or use as short .getJSON()
[19:37:13] <relipse> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[19:37:24] <fonko> i didnt set dataType
[19:37:27] <fonko> from my jquery
[19:37:34] <relipse> yeah jquery will parse it for you
[19:37:41] <coldhead> brend_: http://jsfiddle.net/7e5TR/1/
[19:37:44] <relipse> use jquery's parsing so you dont have to use eval()
[19:38:36] <fonko> let me check that
[19:39:16] <black_warlock> guys if I have a <button></button><a href=""> </a><ul><li></li></ul>
[19:39:33] <black_warlock> how do i get that UL using as selector the button ?
[19:39:53] <black_warlock> is it not $('button').next('ul') ?
[19:40:14] <coldhead> .nextAll('ul:first')
[19:40:29] <black_warlock> ah
[19:41:46] <black_warlock> dam doesnt work
[19:42:07] <black_warlock> i have many of that buttons inside a list
[19:42:36] <black_warlock> and all those buttons have been inserted with a .prepend() function
[19:43:05] <black_warlock> one sec
[19:43:40] <coldhead> works for me black_warlock http://jsfiddle.net/ZpD3G/
[19:44:51] <black_warlock> aye but thats not really my case , my case its strage
[19:45:18] <coldhead> i used the html you gave!
[19:45:32] <coldhead> I DID THE BEST I COULD
[19:45:39] <coldhead> AND IT'S NEVER GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU
[19:45:45] * coldhead runs off crying
[19:47:08] <relipse> how do i find where an element name starts with "column_"
[19:47:19] <relipse> i need all the select boxes that start with column_
[19:47:35] <coldhead> $('[name^="column_"]')
[19:47:45] <relipse> thanks
[19:47:53] <fonko> relipse, is there any function to iterate thorugh my response variable?
[19:47:58] <fonko> because its actually very complex
[19:48:04] <tw2113> $.each()
[19:48:05] <black_warlock> yes coldhead i know
[19:48:07] <chare> link to tutorial on how to do overlay popup with darkened background
[19:48:10] <chare> need help now
[19:48:11] <black_warlock> its not your colp lol
[19:48:17] <relipse> yeah i think $.each() will work
[19:48:22] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/EXZ9r/45/
[19:48:26] <black_warlock> i have this case
[19:48:40] <black_warlock> where the button is generated from a prepend()
[19:48:48] <black_warlock> but
[19:49:12] <black_warlock> i wish to add a listner on each button that check if the next ul is opened or closed
[19:49:23] <black_warlock> indipendently from click function
[19:50:19] <tw2113> couldn't you toggle a class as well, and then inside the click, check for the class
[19:50:26] <tw2113> as a rudamentary check
[19:50:34] <fonko> i have three objects
[19:50:37] <max1> hello......question about qunit......what is the URL if you just want to run 1 module?
[19:51:02] <max1> you need to add a parameter, but i forget what it's called, and can't find it in source or documentation......
[19:51:17] <black_warlock> tw2113 i know that
[19:51:40] <philosophically> using .on() method, working well with loading content, but back button not working after ajax loads? http://pastebin.com/FMvdiUG1
[19:52:00] <black_warlock> but wish to check indipendently from class or from click
[19:52:11] <black_warlock> must just check if display is none or block

[20:00:22] <black_warlock> tw2113 isnt there a way to bind a listner ?
[20:00:30] <black_warlock> to each button ?
[20:00:33] <tw2113> ?bind
[20:00:34] <bot-t> .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/

[20:01:04] <tw2113> so?3 $.each() statements fonko ?
[20:02:15] <fonko> lol
[20:02:17] <fonko> could be

[20:10:10] <jim_m> hi all
[20:12:44] <coldhead> hi jim_m
[20:14:21] <coldhead> Committed revision 175499.
[20:15:24] <bonhoeffer> confusing -- i have a popover, first click nothing happens, then next click the popup starts working like normal, any ideas?
[20:15:53] <philosophically> i have a .on() event that isn't firing after ajax is loaded, if i run the code in firefox's console it works but i have to run it every time i want to use it, i don't understand i thought .on() meant that it will be reusable? http://pastebin.com/FMvdiUG1
[20:17:07] <coldhead> show us the code bonhoeffer
[20:18:43] <coldhead> philosophically: it is but you have to use a different syntax to use delegation
[20:18:47] <coldhead> a la http://pastebin.com/7bLifSVZ
[20:19:11] <coldhead> you select the parent element and bind to that, then tell it which event and which children to watch out for
[20:19:21] <coldhead> it's all in the on() docs if you need more data
[20:19:32] <philosophically> coldhead++ thank you!
[20:24:16] <sriyani> how to middle an alert box?
[20:24:48] <bonhoeffer> coldhead, working on getting the code up
[20:27:26] <bonhoeffer> as i get the code up, is there a way to get $.get to return html raw
[20:28:22] <coldhead> sriyani: it's up to the browser
[20:29:54] <bonhoeffer> more specifically, i have to update a {content: '<b>hi!</b>'} from /foo/index, so $.get('/foo/index') doesn't work
[20:30:08] <bonhoeffer> if /foo/index has only <b>hi</b>
[20:30:46] <bonhoeffer> coldhead, http://serene-ocean-6019.herokuapp.com/calendar/index/Nov-2012
[20:31:04] <bonhoeffer> clicking on a green link causes the "double click" odd behavior
[20:31:23] <bonhoeffer> additionally, i'm trying to serve real content (via ajax) in that popover . . .
[20:36:29] <bonhoeffer> it seems like $.get will load any div with html, but what if i want to get the content of a page and send forward as html as a variable from $.get
[20:36:50] <bonhoeffer> i need to pull in the contents of /foo/index and load this as a variable
[20:39:03] <bonhoeffer> wow -- this looks like a complicated application of unbind, etc
[20:39:33] <coldhead> i can't see any uncompressed code here sorry bonhoeffer
[20:42:59] <bonhoeffer> coldhead, so sorry -- i need to update that
[20:43:57] <bonhoeffer> ok -- pushing
[20:48:59] <jim_m> does anyone know if this is the right way to insert text into my articles?  http://www.beunix.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze-promotext/js/tb-promotext.js
[20:50:02] <coldhead> that's a very nice way, jim_m
[20:50:04] <coldhead> does it worj>
[20:50:08] <coldhead> work*
[20:55:07] <relipse> does anyone know how i can get a select box like this (http://labs.abeautifulsite.net/jquery-selectBox/) with collapsible groups?
[20:55:26] <relipse> i need a select box with groups
[20:55:33] <blink> Hello could someone look at this http://jsfiddle.net/UBjNm/ i would like to make this work so it works on all textareas and every counter is separate from others basically, it only one now works
[20:58:56] <bonhoeffer> coldhead, sorry -- i'll have to work up a fiddle
[21:00:01] <bonhoeffer> coldhead, oh, wait -- my code is not minified now: http://serene-ocean-6019.herokuapp.com/calendar/index/Nov-2012
[21:00:02] <relipse> does anyone know of a select box with collapsible groups (we have a select box with like 100 options and if they were grouped that would make it easier)
[21:03:27] <bonhoeffer> $.get('index', function(data) { foo = data}); <-- this doesn't change foo outside the scope of the function :(
[21:06:56] <relipse> does anyone know if it is possible using jquery to make <optgroup> collapsible?
[21:07:12] <coldhead> bonhoeffer: it does modify that variable outside the function
[21:07:22] <coldhead> it just does it asynchronously
[21:07:26] <coldhead> the first A in AJAX
[21:07:37] <coldhead> so that code might run a few seconds after the other code on the page
[21:07:41] <coldhead> once the server returns
[21:08:12] <coldhead> if you want to do any work with the return value you need to do it inside the callback, at the point where you are trying to assign that value to make it visible outside the callback
[21:08:22] <coldhead> that's how callbacks work
[21:09:26] <coldhead> do ya feel me?
[21:09:35] <blink> coldhead you have litlle bit of time to see something?
[21:10:30] <bonhoeffer> coldhead, yes -- once again . . . i got ya . . . sorry i keep missing this
[21:11:43] <bonhoeffer> coldhead, so https://gist.github.com/4015462
[21:11:53] <bonhoeffer> is trouble -- the data load at the wrong time
[21:11:56] <coldhead> blink: http://jsfiddle.net/UBjNm/1/
[21:12:06] <coldhead> your IDs must be unique, blink
[21:12:13] <coldhead> there can only be one id="limit" per page
[21:12:49] <blink> yeah they do need to be unique just wasnt sure how to do it like that
[21:12:49] <joobie> hey guys.. i am pulling a list of <li>'s dynamically.. then I wanted to make an onclick event that fires when i click on any of the checkboxes in those <li>'s? how can i do this?
[21:12:57] <bonhoeffer> i thought this might work: https://gist.github.com/4015466
[21:13:29] <joobie> i was thinking about adding onclick= to each <li> from the php that is generating the html, but I was wondering if this could be done via jquery itself (and given that the DOM will change after the first load) ?
[21:13:52] <blink> coldhead thanks :) let me see how this is going to work with the forever scroll thing :)
[21:14:09] <coldhead> bonhoeffer: https://gist.github.com/4015465
[21:14:40] <bonhoeffer> processing now . . .
[21:14:57] <coldhead> joobie: let me do you a demo
[21:15:14] <joobie> thanks coldhead
[21:15:30] <tw2113> charge double this time col

[21:18:36] <statusfailed> I have a web page i've loaded via jQuery.ajax(), and I want to apply a selector to it as I would with the current webpage, e.g. $("#someElement > div > ul"), how do I do that?
[21:18:48] <statusfailed> do I use find() ?
[21:19:04] <coldhead> that's what i'd try, statusfailed
[21:19:28] <bonhoeffer> coldhead, i'm much closer: https://gist.github.com/4015484
[21:19:37] <bonhoeffer> but this might be a coffeescript issue
[21:19:37] <statusfailed> okay, i'll give it a shot
[21:19:41] <statusfailed> cheers
[21:19:53] <joobie> thanks coldhead
[21:19:57] <joobie> very kind of you
[21:20:35] <coldhead> bonhoeffer: the produced JS looks okay to me
[21:20:41] <coldhead> those returns shouldn't do any harm
[21:20:45] <coldhead> i guess it still doesn't work?
[21:21:29] <bonhoeffer> no, hmm .. . it is failing
[21:21:31] <Cork-> why do you return the value from $.get to the event listener?
[21:21:45] <coldhead> ah, Crok will fix everything
[21:21:47] <bonhoeffer> Cork-, not sure -- i'll look at it
[21:21:52] <coldhead> my dear Crok
[21:21:59] <Cork-> that jqXHR, can't see what an event listener would do with that
[21:22:29] <Cork-> and ya i would remove all the return's in there
[21:22:48] <coldhead> they're being inserted by coffee script
[21:22:58] <coldhead> which (i think) returns the last statement of the fn
[21:23:02] <Cork-> jiks
[21:23:15] <coldhead> total jiks
[21:23:40] <Cork-> another reason not to like coffee it looks like >_>
[21:24:06] <bonhoeffer> Cork-, yeah -- but i'm stuck with it for now
[21:24:09] <Cork-> but if my memory isn't failing me, can't you ask coffee not to add them?
[21:24:21] <bonhoeffer> i websearched on that
[21:24:42] <bonhoeffer> Cork-, i'm not sure what the  event listener is in this context?
[21:25:05] <Cork-> what are you giving the object to?
[21:25:17] <Cork-> eventClick is a key in an object passed to something
[21:26:17] <Cork-> bonhoeffer: try replacing -> with !->
[21:26:55] <Cork-> might be another framework, though not sure
[21:27:35] <bonhoeffer> no
[21:27:36] <bonhoeffer> https://gist.github.com/4015484
[21:28:12] <Cork-> heh
[21:28:15] <Cork-> ok, pitty
[21:28:21] <coldhead> if you add null as the last line within the function it will return null;
[21:28:24] <coldhead> gross
[21:28:44] <joobie> coldhead, ive updated http://jsfiddle.net/tCq8r/2/ .. any idea why the selector won't match in that instance?
[21:28:48] <joobie> coldhead, that is more in line with my code
[21:28:58] <bonhoeffer> yes
[21:29:04] <Cork-> btw i H-A-T-E implicit returns
[21:29:07] <bonhoeffer> so that is what i did
[21:29:16] <joobie> .. I wanted to fire when the checkbox is set
[21:29:17] <bonhoeffer> anyway -- i'm frustrated and heading to bed
[21:29:25] <bonhoeffer> any last thoughts
[21:29:58] <coldhead> joobie: http://jsfiddle.net/tCq8r/3/
[21:30:16] <coldhead> sleep well, bonhoeffer
[21:30:21] <coldhead> have a better tomorrow
[21:30:24] <coldhead> those are my final thoughts
[21:30:40] <misc--> hi all, I have a bunch of hidden fields like: <input type=hidden name='sap[0][type]' value='whatever'>     <input type=hidden name='sap[1][type]' value='more whatever'>    etc....    how can I loop through the sap elements? I'm trying $("input[name='sap[]']").each(function(idx, value) { alert ('blah'); }    but my alert is not being called
[21:30:42] <Cork-> bonhoeffer: anyway, the event return shouldn't make the data fail
[21:30:48] <Cork-> bonhoeffer: just other event listeners
[21:31:18] <Cork-> bonhoeffer: wait a min...
[21:31:22] <coldhead> misc--: $("input[name^='sap']")
[21:31:23] <joobie> coldhead, if you put check in the checkbox, it doesnt shoot the alert though
[21:31:42] <Cork-> bonhoeffer: could you try adding an extra variable in the get response?
[21:31:54] <coldhead> joobie: http://jsfiddle.net/tCq8r/4/
[21:32:15] <misc--> coldhead: ahh would you believe, I was going to try that. Thanks, that works =)
[21:32:15] <Cork-> bonhoeffer: var locData = data; or something, and use that in the popover
[21:32:29] <coldhead> good luck misc--
[21:32:38] <misc--> thank you
[21:32:58] <Cork-> that's one scary nickname :)
[21:33:10] <bonhoeffer> https://gist.github.com/4015505 <-- "there" never shows
[21:33:13] <Cork-> (for you're karma that is)
[21:33:36] <Cork-> bonhoeffer: but here does?
[21:33:40] <joobie> coldhead, thanks.. for knowledge sake, why can't i reference the li ? I noticed you've gone to the body
[21:33:42] <bonhoeffer> yes
[21:33:50] <tw2113> your* Cork- :D
[21:34:22] <Cork-> bonhoeffer: if you check your browser network tab, what http status does it show?
[21:34:35] * Cork- hits znc over the head
[21:34:38] <coldhead> joobie: the li isn't present on the page
[21:34:43] <coldhead> when it first loads
[21:34:43] <Cork-> let me get my nick back dammit!
[21:34:46] <bonhoeffer> Cork-, hmm. . . same result
[21:34:51] <coldhead> you have to bind to something ON the page
[21:34:56] <bonhoeffer> with https://gist.github.com/4015511
[21:34:58] <joobie> ahh
[21:35:00] <coldhead> body is a safe bet
[21:35:08] <bonhoeffer> looking at network tab
[21:35:19] <coldhead> but you should probably bind to something closer like <ul> if you can
[21:35:19] <Cork-> bonhoeffer: jikes, thats not a local variable, but ya
[21:35:34] <Cork-> be sure to remove it and you should be fine
[21:35:36] <joobie> coldhead, does that mean this function needs to be wrapped in some sort of .ready() ?
[21:36:07] <bonhoeffer> nothing interesting from network tab
[21:36:11] <coldhead> i always recommend that, joobie
[21:36:14] <coldhead> for any jQuery
[21:36:14] <bonhoeffer> just a bunch of gets
[21:36:19] <bonhoeffer> Cork-, remove what
[21:36:35] <coldhead> $(document).ready(function () { /* EVERYTHING GOES HERE */ })
[21:36:55] <Cork-> bonhoeffer: locData is a global variable
[21:37:02] <Cork-> (you don't declare it)
[21:37:05] <bonhoeffer> got it
[21:37:11] <joobie> ahhh
[21:37:12] <Cork-> and ya it was a test anyway
[21:37:13] <joobie> thanks coldhead
[21:37:17] <joobie> apprecaite the help!
[21:37:23] <bonhoeffer> anyway -- any other ideas?
[21:37:38] <joobie> coldhead, would you even define your functions within an .ready() ?
[21:37:46] <Cork-> bonhoeffer: what status does the index request show?
[21:37:52] <coldhead> i would, joobie
[21:37:55] <coldhead> keep it simple
[21:37:56] <joobie> wow ok
[21:37:58] <coldhead> everything in the one place
[21:38:00] <joobie> cool :)
[21:38:04] <bonhoeffer> Cork-, i don't even see it :|
[21:38:07] <joobie> i guess it makes sense.. load your dom, then load javascript
[21:38:09] <joobie> keeps the loading uniform
[21:38:12] <bonhoeffer> doesn't look like it is calling
[21:38:25] <Cork-> bonhoeffer: so the get request doesn't happen at all??
[21:38:36] <Cork-> that's....
[21:39:11] <bonhoeffer> Cork-, looks like it
[21:40:27] <Cork-> bonhoeffer: ok, so what browser are you using?
[21:41:13] <bonhoeffer> chrome, but this doesn't work: https://gist.github.com/4015529
[21:41:23] <bonhoeffer> :(
[21:41:50] <Cork-> and no error in the erro console?
[21:42:03] <bonhoeffer> nope
[21:42:04] <Cork-> *error
[21:42:11] <bonhoeffer> https://gist.github.com/4015529 <-- added result
[21:42:37] <bonhoeffer> none
[21:42:40] <Cork-> and if you replace alert with console.log?
[21:42:58] <Cork-> do you still get the same result?
[21:43:38] <bonhoeffer> hmm. . . wait
[21:43:58] <bonhoeffer> i might need return false there
[21:44:22] <Cork-> better adding an empty "return" at the end
[21:44:38] <Cork-> that way you don't return anything
[21:44:44] <bonhoeffer> got it
[21:44:46] <tw2113> Cork-, are you being forced to adapt the - in your nick?
[21:44:54] <bonhoeffer> the function was returning true and redirecting
[21:45:01] <bonhoeffer> before anything could happen
[21:45:12] <Cork-> tw2113: its the fallback nick, and znc prevents me from changing back to my normal nick :/
[21:45:32] <tw2113> what's znc?
[21:45:39] <Cork-> ?g znc
[21:45:41] <bot-t> Cork-, ZNC - http://znc.in/
[21:45:44] <coldhead> i don't know who this Cork- guy is but i like him better than that Cork guy
[21:45:54] <Cork-> lol
[21:46:05] <tw2113> ah
[21:46:13] <tw2113> i agree coldhead, excellent point
[21:46:36] <Cork-> seems i'm going to have to restart znc to get this fixed :/
[21:47:14] <bonhoeffer> Cork-, lol indeed, well http://serene-ocean-6019.herokuapp.com/ <-- it is close to working, except i have to click twice to get the popup to start cycling
[21:47:22] <bonhoeffer> any thoughts appreciated
[21:47:55] <coldhead> wasn't that the original problem, bonhoeffer ?
[21:48:32] <Cork-> what is it i'm meant to click to reproduce?
[21:49:14] <bonhoeffer> yep
[21:49:34] <coldhead> the green squares
[21:49:36] <bonhoeffer> well, production it is not working -- the green bars
[21:49:50] <Cork-> can't get them to work at all
[21:50:10] <coldhead> try clicking harder
[21:50:18] <Cork-> :D
[21:50:19] <tw2113> force that button down!
[21:50:25] <bonhoeffer> ha! i fixed an update
[21:50:28] <bonhoeffer> pushing now
[21:51:26] <Cork-> the page is quite slow to load...
[21:51:51] <bonhoeffer> sorry
[21:52:05] * tw2113 kicks znc for Cork- 
[21:52:13] <Cork-> and i still need three click for it to work
[21:52:18] <bonhoeffer> yes
[21:52:23] <bonhoeffer> the three click is killing me
[21:52:36] <bonhoeffer> and the popup content is just proof of concept stuff
[21:53:07] <coldhead> i got this one, guys: $('*').click(function () { $(this).trigger('click').trigger('click').trigger('click'); });
[21:53:28] <tw2113> *golf clap*
[21:53:31] <bonhoeffer> and they don't hide on the second click
[21:53:40] <bonhoeffer> hmm . . .
[21:54:23] <bonhoeffer> i don't understand the triple click
[21:54:49] <tw2113> $('*').click(function(){ console.log('click harder'); console.log('oh come on, what are you? a girly-man?'); console.log('that is the stuff right there ohhhhh baby'); });
[21:56:30] <Cork-> uh... "if (typeof option == 'string') data[option]()"
[21:56:47] <Cork-> bonhoeffer: you're sure popover is meant to get the html as option?
[21:56:57] <Cork-> ah, no its not sorry
[21:59:22] <Cork-> bonhoeffer: pophover waits for a click to activate
[21:59:31] <Cork-> bonhoeffer: are you sure that's what you want?
[21:59:56] <Cork-> that means one click for the ajax to load, and one click for the popup to happen (not sure where the third comes from yet)
[22:00:46] <bonhoeffer> goodness ... . not what i want
[22:01:02] <bonhoeffer> not sure how i can work around that
[22:01:15] <Cork-> bonhoeffer: i think what you're looking for is manual, and then after you've loaded your ajax data you do .show
[22:02:05] <BabySuperman> how do I get a button.click inside a link!?  <a href=""><span class="btn">My button</span></a>  Right now it just takes me to the link, hrmmmm
[22:02:32] <Cork-> you have to prevent the original event
[22:02:46] <BabySuperman> aye, how do I do that when I know they also clicked the button!?
[22:02:47] <Cork-> button.click(function(event) { event.preventDefault() })
[22:03:11] <BabySuperman> lemme try that, i just ASSUMED that wouldn't work :)
[22:03:13] <BabySuperman> tyvm Cork-
[22:03:26] <Cork-> BabySuperman: if button is the a link that is
[22:03:37] <Cork-> if not; then i don't see why you have that link there to begin with
[22:03:41] <BabySuperman> ah, no, the link is around the button (I have screen shots with a "remove" button on them)
[22:03:55] <bonhoeffer> Cork-, ok maybe i need to do this independent of full-calendar's events
[22:03:56] <BabySuperman> <a href=""> <img> <button to remove></a>
[22:03:59] <Cork-> event.stopPropagation() is what you want then
[22:04:04] <BabySuperman> tyvm
[22:04:11] <BabySuperman> so knowledgable ;)
[22:04:13] <Cork-> but, ya you should just remove the link
[22:04:22] <BabySuperman> no way jose!
[22:04:33] <BabySuperman> that also didnt work
[22:04:36] <Cork-> O_o
[22:04:54] <BabySuperman> im pretty sure its not even firing the event
[22:04:54] <BabySuperman> lol
[22:05:14] <Cork-> well you might not be clicking the button
[22:05:15] <BabySuperman> i have z-index on the button to 999 also
[22:05:20] <BabySuperman> sheems like it
[22:05:46] <Cork-> feels like you should really try to clean up this code a bit, feels quite a bit like hack and slash to me...
[22:06:15] <BabySuperman> well it definitely is!  but, I think what I'll do is just make the whole div.click
[22:06:19] <BabySuperman> and just get rid of the A around it
[22:06:22] <BabySuperman> that sound reasonable?
[22:06:39] <Cork-> well you're tying to build a house on quicksand
[22:06:49] <BabySuperman> go on
[22:07:06] <Cork-> you should try to stabilize the foundation before trying to build on it
[22:07:22] <Cork-> at least read and understand how the pages flow works
[22:07:24] <BabySuperman> err....
[22:07:30] <BabySuperman> whoa, I definitely am doing that...
[22:07:44] <statusfailed> dumb question time
[22:07:52] <statusfailed> $.map appears to lose the final element in my array
[22:08:04] <Cork-> BabySuperman: so you've checked out what the $.popover function does when you've called it?
[22:08:04] <statusfailed> is that expected?
[22:08:13] <Cork-> statusfailed: no
[22:08:28] <Cork-> statusfailed: do you have a demo?
[22:08:35] <statusfailed> Cork-: 2 seconds
[22:08:37] <BabySuperman> Nope, not using popover -- I used bootstrap popover for a couple things
[22:08:51] <statusfailed> Gonna check i'm not on an old version...
[22:08:57] <Cork-> ya, like the response from your get call
[22:15:56] <statusfailed> ok, weird, I was doing $.map(mixedArrayOfAAndB, function(x) { return x.text(); }) and fixed by doing return $(x).text()
[22:16:10] <statusfailed> my fault, but not sure why ^^
[22:16:33] <statusfailed> oh, was calling text; not text()
[22:17:12] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take five
[22:17:25] <Cork-> x won't be a jquery object, unless its an array of jquery objects (that would be a bit wasteful)
[22:17:44] <statusfailed> the array came from $('some selector').children()
[22:17:50] <statusfailed> so those aren't jquery objects?
[22:17:52] <Cork-> ok, then x is a dom element
[22:17:57] <statusfailed> ah ok
[22:17:58] <statusfailed> thanks :)
[22:18:00] <Cork-> so ya you need $()
[22:35:10] <Cork> there we go
[22:58:13] <fonko> so guys
[22:58:16] <fonko> i have this url
[22:58:18] <fonko> "https://api.twitter.com/1/users/profile_image/abraham"
[22:58:23] <fonko> that takes me to a redirection
[22:58:28] <fonko> i want to store that in a variable
[22:58:54] <fonko> in order to show the content into the "src" of img tag (because it redirects you to the thumbnail url)
[22:58:59] <fonko> how would you do that?
[23:08:04] <tw2113> var img = "https://api.twitter.com/1/users/profile_image/abraham"
[23:08:18] <tw2113> fonko
[23:08:45] <tw2113> maybe
[23:09:41] <tw2113> maybe do an ajax get request for it?
[23:13:04] <Cork> fonko: you mean store the redurect or just that url?
[23:13:09] <Cork> *redirect
[23:15:12] <fonko> THANKS!
[23:15:16] <fonko> tw2113,
[23:16:00] <tw2113> not sure how to work around the 302 result
[23:17:00] <Cork> you shouldn't have to
[23:17:11] <Cork> that just means the browser has it in its cache already
[23:20:39] <prasanth_g> is this code correct?
[23:20:41] <prasanth_g> http://pastebin.com/ZffNFaXr
[23:20:55] <prasanth_g> i want to display div content randomly on page refresh
[23:21:01] <tw2113> so basically, Cork because i already have it cached, it returns no data?
[23:21:14] <MagePsycho>  can you recommend any good custom dropdown jquery plugins
[23:21:22] <Cork> tw2113: it should still return it, but the server shouldn't return anything
[23:21:53] <Cork> tw2113: the browser sends a last fetch time, and the server checks if the data has changed
[23:22:03] <Cork> tw2113: if it hasn't it just sends a 302 header and no body
[23:22:04] <tw2113> i must be doing something not quite right then http://jsfiddle.net/ZTaMm/1/
[23:22:22] <tw2113> i'm just toying around with fonko's issue
[23:23:09] <Cork> that has nothing to do with 302
[23:23:17] <Cork> you can't do xss ajax calls
[23:23:31] <tw2113> stupid js
[23:23:33] <tw2113> :D
[23:23:59] <Cork> well if twitter added a header to allow it it would work
[23:24:06] <Cork> but i really don't see why they would
[23:24:18] <tw2113> they're more likely to kick me in the balls
[23:24:27] <Cork> ya, something like that XD
[23:24:49] <tw2113> fonko, just use the url the json gives you
[23:24:54] <tw2113> it works in the end
[23:25:10] <tw2113> http://jsfiddle.net/ZTaMm/2/
[23:25:15] <tw2113> see fonko ?
[23:26:18] <Cork> prasanth_g: that seams like your asking in the wrong channel
[23:26:27] <Cork> prasanth_g: that's plain js not jquery
[23:26:34] <prasanth_g> ooh
[23:26:36] <prasanth_g> ok
[23:26:44] <Cork> but ya, you're racy there
[23:28:34] <MagePsycho> guys: how can we have such field: http://picpaste.com/pics/input-field-dropdown-search-Gq4o5hnp.1352100481.png
[23:30:09] <Cork> Mage: you put a input field, followed by a fake select (css+js generated) followed by a button
[23:30:14] <Cork> *MagePsycho:
[23:30:34] <Cork> it's mainly just css fiddeling
[23:30:46] <MagePsycho> Cork: there is | as separator
[23:31:05] <Cork> its prob just an image
[23:31:18] <tw2113> or a css border
[23:31:28] <Cork> or a span or div with no content and ya a border
[23:31:42] <Cork> hard to tell from an image
[23:32:00] <tw2113> if only form elements were easy to get to be the same height
[23:32:33] <MagePsycho> Cork,tw2113: which custom jquery dropdown plugin would you prefer?
[23:32:41] <tw2113> don't have one
[23:32:46] <Cork> ya, thats prob a wrapping div around it all just to make it apper the're the same hight
[23:33:02] <Cork> MagePsycho: that's prob a bit too specific for an existing plugin
[23:33:42] <MagePsycho> can we ahieve the same dropdown by pure css only?
[23:34:02] <tw2113> they've already proved it with css dropdown menus
[23:34:04] <Cork> the select dropdown can't be done through just cs
[23:34:08] <tw2113> what makes this one different?
[23:34:15] <Cork> *css
[23:34:23] <MrMister> has anyone experienced the mouseleave event not triggering when using the menubar plugin?
[23:34:24] <tw2113> other than not being an actual select dropdown input
[23:37:38] <zend_dev> hi\
[23:37:40] <zend_dev> hi
[23:38:11] <zend_dev> any way to display old history when filling form
[23:38:38] <zend_dev> i am submitting form using ajax
[23:40:45] <MagePsycho> which jquery plugin for custom dropdown do you use guys?
[23:40:58] <tw2113> i don't?
[23:41:47] <Trisox> custom one in this project
[23:42:06] <Trisox> you can go for the jquery ui one
[23:42:47] <Cork> zend_dev: depends on the browser, but most browsers doens't store form elements unless the submission goes through (you normally abort them when you do ajax calls)
[23:43:04] <Cork> zend_dev: for those browsers, the only way to make it work is to not use ajax
[23:43:27] <zend_dev> but any suggestion
[23:43:42] <zend_dev> for browser which store
[23:43:51] <Cork> zend_dev: make the form an iframe or something and let it use normal http to submit it
[23:43:54] <Cork> no other way
[23:44:04] <zend_dev> and with ajax use
[23:44:09] <Cork> not possible
[23:44:18] <Cork> you would have to build the history your self
[23:44:59] <zend_dev> how make history ?
[23:45:04] <Cork> zend_dev: forms is a real pain when it comes to these things
[23:45:24] <Cork> zend_dev: hmm lets back up a bit
[23:45:37] <Cork> zend_dev: are you talking about a login form or just normal form elements?
[23:45:43] <Cork> (cause i talked about the first one)
[23:45:57] <zend_dev> all form
[23:45:59] <zend_dev> all forms
[23:46:11] <Cork> ok, are they wrapped in a form tag?
[23:46:16] <zend_dev> most important for normal for
[23:46:17] <zend_dev> most important for normal form
[23:46:23] <zend_dev> yes
[23:46:24] <Cork> and are you doing the ajax call from a submit event?
[23:46:29] <Cork> (on the form eleemnt)
[23:46:32] <Cork> *element
[23:46:37] <zend_dev> yes
[23:46:56] <Cork> hmm i think that should work for all browsers
[23:47:02] <zend_dev> i am sending form element in "data" option when ajx call
[23:47:08] <Cork> at least except for a few special fields
[23:47:24] <Cork> that doesn't matter
[23:47:30] <zend_dev> ok
[23:47:37] <Cork> what matters is the submit event
[23:47:44] <Cork> on a form element
[23:48:11] <Cork> you're stopping the submit event with return false or event.preventDefault() ?
[23:48:13] <zend_dev> $.ajax
[23:48:29] <Cork> zend_dev: what you use to make the js call doesn't matter
[23:48:31] <zend_dev> i am using validationEngine
[23:48:42] <aaas> what is it called when a click pops up a js overlay dialog box--is there a word for this?
[23:49:09] <Cork> aaas: showing a confirmation dialog?
[23:49:29] <Cork> aaas: but basically no
[23:50:01] <zend_dev> i am checking form using "validationEngine('validate')"
[23:50:03] <aaas> Cork well not necessarily...im looking to create a input form...im thinking of a fancy js box i might have seen before which darkens the background and shows something (usually a picture in other contexts)
[23:50:15] <tw2113> lightbox?
[23:50:23] <zend_dev> when form correctly field then it will submit
[23:50:31] <Cork> thats the name of a plugin though not showing a dialog :)
[23:50:37] <aaas> maybe it is lightbox
[23:50:43] <aaas> but lightbox isn't for forms is it?
[23:50:49] <aaas> ah
[23:50:53] <Cork> its for content
[23:50:53] <tw2113> i think you can show anything you want in them
[23:50:58] <Cork> yes
[23:51:11] <tw2113> i heard Cork shows his picture randomly to scare people
[23:51:14] <tw2113> in a light box
[23:52:28] <aaas> i am probably overthinking it...i guess i just need some sort of jq 'popup' form
[23:52:57] <tw2113> aaas, http://line25.com/articles/rounding-up-the-top-10-jquery-lightbox-scripts
[23:53:17] <aaas> tw2113 thanks
[23:54:03] <Cork> tw2113: you mean something like http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lb01o6tn481qe0eclo1_r8_500.gif
[23:54:04] <tw2113> and that's just 10
[23:54:40] <tw2113> yes
[23:54:45] <Cork> lol
[23:55:34] <zend_dev> cork: what should i do
[23:56:13] <Cork> zend_dev: you need to check what the plugins does to the original submit event
[23:56:33] <zend_dev> mens ?
[23:56:54] <zend_dev> i am submitting it using $.ajax
[23:57:06] <Cork> zend_dev: what you do in js doens't matter
[23:57:12] <Cork> it what happens to the event that matter
[23:57:15] <Cork> +s
[23:57:20] <Cork> i've already said this
[23:57:26] <zend_dev> yes
[23:57:40] <Cork> the browser doesn't care how you do you're js net calls
[23:57:41] <zend_dev> but which event
[23:57:48] <tw2113> the submit event
[23:58:13] <zend_dev>  yes i am using form element and one button
[23:58:16] <Clorith> Hmm, I'm doing a .ajax() call in a script, works fine in chrome but in IE I get an "Invalid argument" error, not quite sure what it could be related to. Put my jQuery up at http://jsfiddle.net/9Z5P5/1/ and the output of the console log/dir's are there as well
[23:58:17] <tw2113> .on('submit', function(){ });
[23:58:30] <zend_dev> when i am clicking on button it will submit using ajax
[23:58:36] <tw2113> zend_dev,
[23:58:46] <tw2113> the event you're looking for, is named "submit"
[23:58:46] <Cork> zend_dev: if you construct your form correctly: you have a <input type="submit"> a form tag, and you bind the submit event on the form tag
[23:58:47] <zend_dev> yes
[23:59:00] <tw2113> that's the event name you need to get into
[23:59:19] <X-Raimo> hello. How to select all: data-tr="loc[str.]" elements
[23:59:44] <Cork> X-Raimo: you mean all elements with that exact string?
[23:59:44] <zend_dev> means in form tag i have to write submitevent="myjsfunctionname"
[23:59:51] <tw2113> no
