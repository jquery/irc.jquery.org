[00:00:27] <Maximilian> hello, is there a way to inhertit from another jQuery plugin? lets say I want to use plgA() and plgB(). plgB should have all methods plgA has, but some more
[00:01:57] <Beg_> NielsNLx> thanks, I never had to do that before, but you opened my eyes :)
[00:02:31] <sammichToo> okay, I need quick help for this, Array.map() isn't async, so why does this happen? http://jsfiddle.net/mnDU7/
[00:02:43] <NielsNLx> btw checkout the manual  there are more ways on doing that
[00:03:02] <sammichToo> ignore the fact that I'm doing an attribute selector
[00:06:17] <sammichToo> sigh, I never get help when I'm at work :|
[00:10:14] <dblosevn> sammichToo: never say never lol http://jsfiddle.net/mnDU7/1/
[00:12:53] <dblosevn> NoOova: you could append an element to the dom if it doesnt exist and query that element then remove it
[00:14:59] <dblosevn> NoOova: id probally append it wrapped in a transparent absolutely positioned div so it doesnt screw up your layout in the process
[00:15:10] <xec_> sammichToo: just a heads up, you might want to quote the attribute value, as in [attr="val"] rather than [attr=val] in case they contain weird characters or space etc
[00:16:45] <dblosevn> must be tired I missed that lol
[00:17:32] <NoOova> dblosevn: but it is slowww.
[00:17:59] <dblosevn> how slow? i couldnt imagine it taking more then a couple ms
[00:21:52] <Krisostoomus> hi anyone knows what is wrong in my script? http://pastebin.com/egTv1V5t
[00:22:26] <Krisostoomus> Im only getting message "error". where can I see what does it mean more specifically?
[00:33:27] <Krisostoomus> How to get in jquery crossdomain post request error specific information?
[00:36:27] <Krisostoomus> can anyone help me with that?
[00:37:05] <dblosevn> NoOova: http://jsfiddle.net/ZXQdQ/ on average 2ms
[00:38:07] <dblosevn> and i think jsfiddle may be part at fault as well as the execution time calc
[00:38:48] <henn1nk> http://demos.xiaothemes.com/kutcher/ how is this effect with the background images called? parrallax?
[00:41:35] <dblosevn> Krisostoomus: i think your understanding of CORS might be lacking, soundcloud.com would have to send thoughs headers not youu
[00:42:22] <Krisostoomus> what is cors?
[00:42:32] <dblosevn> not to mention that url is a 404 page
[00:42:42] <Krisostoomus> I'm making automatic script for sharing sounds
[00:43:08] <dblosevn> if the service supports jsonp then use jsonp, if not youll have to write a proxy script
[00:43:32] <dblosevn> ?g what is CORS @ Krisostoomus
[00:43:33] <b-ot> Krisostoomus: Sorry, no results for ‟what is CORS @ Krisostoomus”.
[00:44:30] <dblosevn> Krisostoomus: http://techblog.constantcontact.com/software-development/using-cors-for-cross-domain-ajax-requests/
[00:45:05] <Krisostoomus> cant the data be whatever kind. yeah, now i remember jsonp is for cross domain
[00:48:02] <pagios> hello all
[00:51:41] <pagios> anyone familair iwth quicksand?
[00:53:44] <xec_> yes. don't wiggle, you'll just sink faster
[00:53:54] <xec_> do you have a rope?
[00:54:28] <pagios> cool
[00:54:43] <sammichToo> dblosevn: dammit, you win.
[00:55:15] <pagios> i am tring to make quicksand paginated on that website
[00:55:49] <dblosevn> sammichToo: nice winning
[00:56:07] <sammichToo> it'
[00:56:38] <sammichToo> my bad. It's not an in place function. Now, if it were an object, it'd be a different story
[00:57:11] <sammichToo> that said. Is putting Underscore.js into my projects a worthwhile prop?
[00:57:16] <pagios> i am trying to paginate the follow quicksand filter: www.hipernation.com user/pss: guest123/123123123
[00:57:32] <pagios> i enqueued and registered the quicksandpaginated.js
[00:57:37] <pagios> how can i initializei t?
[00:59:53] <dblosevn> pagios: http://www.hipernation.com/wp-content/themes/yin_and_yang/js/jquery.quicksand.init.js?ver=3.5.2 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ,
[01:00:20] <dblosevn> your missing an identifier here thumbs: "article", "term-name", on line 122
[01:01:07] <dblosevn> or it should be an array
[01:01:21] <pagios> dblosevn: actually that whole section needs to be adapted.. $(function(){      $("#filter").quicksandpaginated({  to my qwuicksand
[01:01:27] <dblosevn> eg.. thumbs: ['article', 'term-name']
[01:01:30] <pagios> but i am failing to adapt it correctly... dunno what parameters to use
[01:02:03] <pagios> line122 is what i tried to improvise..
[01:02:07] <dblosevn> I dontknow anything about quicksand, just saw the syntax error
[01:05:18] <dblosevn> pagios: i dont see thumb as an available config option in there docs
[01:06:57] <lethjakman> is there a nice way to listen for drag_stop events
[01:07:18] <dblosevn> nor is the word thumbs even in there src code
[01:07:57] <dblosevn> lethjakman: jquery ui .draggable, .droppable
[01:08:12] <pagios> dblosevn: which values should i set in that config to map correctly to my quicksand ?
[01:13:08] <dblosevn> pagios: http://dblosevn.chosd.com/187 that looks close but looking at your markup it seems it isnt even compatible with the plugin
[01:14:00] <pagios> yea
[01:14:47] <pagios> dblosevn: you think i can try that?
[01:16:39] <dblosevn> you can try it almost betting it wont work until you get your markup right
[01:18:34] <pagios> i cant figure out how to do it with that plugin honestly
[01:19:21] <pagios> dblosevn: how can i refer to the main class
[01:19:31] <pagios> without really caring about the child elements
[01:20:20] <henn1nk> is there a command line tool for compressing several jquery/js files into one minified file?
[01:26:25] <pagios> dblosevn: how can i get my markups right :/
[01:27:33] <dblosevn> $("#filterable-gallery").quicksandpaginated(); try that and see if it works
[01:27:50] <dblosevn> then work on the additional features you want to add
[01:28:03] <pagios> dblosevn: try this you mean http://dblosevn.chosd.com/187
[01:28:17] <dblosevn> no that one liner i just posted
[01:28:41] <dblosevn> use that as a starting point if it works then add additional features one by one
[01:29:02] <pagios> thjat one liner if works should add pagination ? ;/
[01:29:15] <pagios> i maean how can i tell if it works ?:)
[01:35:38] <pagios> dblosevn: what do u expect that to do
[01:36:06] <pagios> the one liner
[01:36:26] <soee> how can i prevent Enter to submit form when pressed when focus is on  one single form element ?
[01:42:44] <Tomashe> Hey guys , anyone knows any pluging that can create real font border
[01:42:56] <Tomashe> not css text-shadow
[01:44:53] <dblosevn> pagios: after looking at it nothing lol, there api is a little too complex for me to look into right now, I have a deadline in like 6 hours and I have been stuck for aboout 10
[01:45:49] <pagios> sorry about that
[02:03:40] <pingo> any idea why proxy would not be assigning the value of 'this' inside append func with bind it works? "append.bind(this)(item, referenceItem);" vs. "$.proxy(append(item, referenceItem), this);"
[02:06:07] <noregret> if i want to check if a 3rd <td> exists, is if ( $(this).find('td').eq(3) ){} enough ?
[02:07:04] <noregret> this will be executed in a $('tr').each(function(){ ... })
[02:21:05] <airdem> how can i trigger the ui widgets change event?
[02:21:37] <vsync_> pull the trigger
[02:22:07] <airdem> im talking about the spinner widget, forgot to mention
[02:22:08] <Krisostoomus> OPTIONS http://soundcloud.com/teineaccount/dropbox/droppings 500 (Internal Server Error)
[02:22:16] <Krisostoomus> sry
[02:22:28] <vsync_> yes
[02:23:31] <Krisostoomus> Hello! I'm still stuggling with ajax cross domain post. Can anyone tell me whats wrong there? http://pastebin.com/kjgRr1z2 Im getting one error more...
[02:23:42] <Krisostoomus> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://soundcloud.com/teineaccount/dropbox/droppings. Origin http://djrankings.org is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[02:23:53] <Krisostoomus> It should be ok, but its not working.
[02:26:40] <nFFF> Krisostoomus, have you tried stackoverlow?
[02:26:59] <Krisostoomus> yes, ive searched a bit..
[02:27:42] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/2WWj6/ anyone can help me . what i do here wrong .. im trying to make a nice smooth crcle effect
[02:28:34] <seutje> Krisostoomus: you need to set that header on the receiving domain, not the requesting domain
[02:28:49] <seutje> Krisostoomus: ergo, u'd need access to soundcloud's servers
[02:29:42] <Krisostoomus> but i can send this post from web browser, why not from jquery?
[02:31:10] <Krisostoomus> but i also set referer, that should make the trick, aint it?
[02:31:14] <seutje> wow, didn't even notice u were trying to make a synchronous post
[02:31:19] <seutje> why use ajax at all then?
[02:32:25] <seutje> Krisostoomus: you're setting a response header in the request, it doesn't work like that
[02:33:11] <Krisostoomus> I changed that now...
[02:33:37] <Tomashe> anyone can help me out with my issue?
[02:33:40] <Krisostoomus> Ajax cross domain post requires sync...
[02:34:30] <henn1nk> short question. how can i stop that after clicking a link the page is loading the link?
[02:35:04] <henn1nk> oh got it
[02:39:01] <Krisostoomus> i removed also that async
[02:41:22] <seutje> Krisostoomus: if the server doesn't expect crossdomain requests from your domain, you will need to use a proxy script on your own server
[02:41:31] <seutje> see http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/
[02:51:32] <Krisostoomus> to make a cors, you simply add xhrFields: {  withCredentials: false    }, ?
[02:51:55] <lemonsparrow> hi all
[02:55:02] <lemonsparrow> I have this piece of code http://pastie.org/private/xmm2v2bvytemplzuckgiqa but this isnt working since onbeforeunload seems to not be supported by many browsers.. (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14645011/window-onbeforeunload-and-window-onunload-is-not-working-in-firefox-safari-o#answer-14647730)
[02:55:19] <lemonsparrow> is there a way i can code the same thing another way ?
[02:57:54] <seutje> lemonsparrow: unbeforeunload works across all main browsers, but your implementation is a bit weird
[02:58:12] <seutje> this string you are returning, where is it suppose to go?
[02:58:26] <dubphil> hello ! is there a metodology to debug when a code works on firefox but not on chrome ? there is no error in chrome in the console but the code is not working :(
[02:58:49] <seutje> dubphil: try to run it in an incognito window without any extensions
[02:59:24] <dubphil> seutje: ok
[02:59:34] <seutje> it might also be cause by chrome parsing the document faster/slower than FF, which would suggest racing conditions in your code
[02:59:47] <airdem> whats a good way to trigger an event after the user stopped changing the input?
[02:59:55] <Krisostoomus> Hello. Im still getting errors from http://pastebin.com/nUg6Vh4v while using CORS.
[02:59:56] <Krisostoomus> Failed to load resource: Origin http://djrankings.org is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[02:59:57] <lemonsparrow> seutje: is int that string automatically put up as alert?
[03:00:04] <Krisostoomus> Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)
[03:00:12] <seutje> airdem: keyUp, debounced on like 100-200 ms
[03:00:35] <seutje> lemonsparrow: what makes you think that?
[03:00:51] <seutje> lemonsparrow: I'm an idiot, ur right
[03:00:56] <lemonsparrow> seutje: sicne I dont see this method being called anywhere in the js code
[03:01:09] <lemonsparrow> seutje: no u can't be an idiot
[03:01:11] <lemonsparrow> seutje: :(
[03:02:04] <lemonsparrow> seutje: u there?
[03:02:15] <seutje> sure
[03:02:28] <lemonsparrow> seutje: why did u say u r an idiot ?
[03:02:50] <seutje> because I forgot most browsers use that return value in the prompt dialog
[03:04:12] <seutje> lemonsparrow: it's highly suggested you bind the event properly instead of using the .on- property
[03:04:38] <seutje> e.g. through addEventListenener
[03:07:36] <bartzy> Hey, I hope this is fine here:
[03:07:51] <bartzy> Where should I place a CSS file for fonts, like fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Dosis:400,600,800
[03:07:58] <bartzy> Before all my CSS in the <head> ?
[03:08:35] <ocx> hello i need help with paginating my quicksand, anyone willing to help?
[03:08:45] <lemonsparrow> seutje: any other way I can handle this using some other API ??
[03:09:18] <seutje> lemonsparrow: don't think there's any way to properly support that on say... mobile devices
[03:09:47] <lemonsparrow> seutje: this is web
[03:10:12] <seutje> here I was, thinking this is sparta
[03:10:29] <seutje> certainly explains the lack of painted-on abs
[03:10:46] <lemonsparrow> seutje: all I want to do is... if user edit form values and leaves page (navigates to some other page without even clicking save button) then this ajax call should be triggered.. thats the whole thing I want to get done
[03:11:35] <seutje> yeah, I doubt u can get that to work across all devices
[03:14:10] <Krisostoomus> Hello. Please take a look at http://djrankings.org/soundcloudproject/sharesoundjquery.php . Whats wrong there?
[03:16:19] <Krisostoomus> if i set the datatype to jsonp, then the post look like blabla?callback=jquery&variable=hmm and it will say that the page is not found. so i changed the datatype to json, but now im getting the these errors...
[03:17:00] <lemonsparrow> seutje: not devices web browsers
[03:28:47] <lemonsparrow> seutje: this is my whole function but it doesnt work all the time on all browsers https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6111855
[03:35:01] <seutje> lemonsparrow: heh? beforeunload doesn't bubble, so stoppropagate doesn't actually do anything does it? even if you call it twice o.O
[03:36:22] <lemonsparrow> seutje: I do get the pop up at times.. u see the issue is with the aync nature of my ajax calls...
[03:36:25] <lemonsparrow> seutje: hope u got it
[03:37:24] <lemonsparrow> seutje: need a fix for it something like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16452926/window-bind-event-not-firing-ajax-call
[03:52:29] <airdem> can somebody help me debouncing a jquery ui spinner?

[04:00:19] <ocx> i am trying to paginate quicksand

[04:41:29] <ocx> <ocx> but clicking on the pagination doesnt load the elements, loads only current ones
[04:41:42] <ocx> any idea how to load the remaining elementS?
[04:42:36] <Krisostoomus> hi can anyone tell me why am i gettinga alert("15"). http://pastebin.com/hCVigUef

[04:43:00] <Krisostoomus> its driving me mad
[04:44:27] <Rockwood> hello everybody
[04:47:50] <KeyboardNotFound> Hello Rockwood
[04:48:10] <titii> Hi all, can I submit the form, with my submit button
[04:48:29] <slax0r> ofc you can
[04:48:44] <titii> I have 3 submits, I need something like this $(mybuton).submit(form)
[04:48:53] <titii> slax0r: how?
[04:50:04] <slax0r> $('button selector').click(function() {$('formselector').submit();});
[04:50:08] <slax0r> more or less
[04:50:20] <lemonsparrow> I added the code inside $(window).unload(function(){ but is there a way to make this function synchronous... I want to redirect to the page only after making sure that the window.unload method is completely finished executing
[04:51:12] <Krisostoomus> anyone can tell why am i getting 15 all the time, while i should get 0,...,14 http://djrankings.org/soundcloudproject/sharesoundjquery.php
[04:54:22] <slax0r> you'll never get 0-14 like that
[04:54:27] <shoky> Krisostoomus: because by the time the setTimeout callback is called, the loop is already long finished and i is 15
[04:54:39] <slax0r> this...
[04:56:07] <shoky> Krisostoomus: you need a local function scope in each iteration to save the i. e.g.  for (i=0; i<15; i++) { (function(i) { setTimeout(...); })(i) }
[04:56:53] <titii> slax0r: I though there is a solution like I wrote $(mybuton).submit(form), there is? This is still not right for me
[04:57:30] <shoky> Krisostoomus: or just.. $.each(new Array(15), function(i) { ... });
[04:57:50] <slax0r> titii, you can't call submit on the button, you must wire the click event of the button to a function and from within that function you fire form submit
[04:58:25] <Krisostoomus> thank you all! :)
[05:00:23] <Rockwood> hello keyboardNotFound
[05:00:41] <Rockwood> sorry for delay reply
[05:00:45] <slax0r> press f1 to continue
[05:03:37] <Gregoric> Hello. I have a form that submits data to Google Spreadsheet; when user clicks the submit button, I'd like the submitting to be paused. Then, I'd like an AJaX call to another PHP file located on my server to be completed (it has to be fired after user tries to submit the form). When the call is complete, I'd like the regular form submission to be continued. Is my aim achievable?
[05:04:48] <Gregoric> *the regular form submission should be continued automatically, just after the AJaX call is complete, no matter if it returns success or error
[05:06:06] <Gregoric> I have tried to do this in several ways, this is my current version of the script; it completes AJAX but the regular form is not submitted until I press 'submit' again ( http://pastebin.com/PEM8JGQV )
[05:07:23] <slax0r> Gregoric, first catch the submit event
[05:07:38] <slax0r> $(form).submit(function(e)
[05:07:44] <slax0r> prevent default: e.preventDefault();
[05:08:01] <slax0r> make the ajax call, and in success do: this.submit()
[05:08:09] <slax0r> it must be "this" not, $(this)
[05:08:45] <slax0r> ah...just saw your code :P
[05:09:44] <slax0r> does complete fire in your ajax?
[05:11:49] <Gregoric> slax0r sorry got disconnected, I've read logs
[05:12:04] <Gregoric> Ajax is completed
[05:12:14] <Gregoric> Successfully, if that matters
[05:14:48] <Rockwood> http://jsfiddle.net/57GhS/ is not working please can you check what is wrong in it?
[05:16:59] <Rockwood> http://jsfiddle.net/57GhS/ is not working please can you check what is wrong in it?
[05:17:48] <Gregoric> slax0r, just checked: complete fires (chekcked with simple .html() ) but the .submit() does not work... COnsole does not produce any errors
[05:18:33] <henn1nk> does someone know how to slide in different divs when scrolling down? for nicer look..
[05:18:53] <henn1nk> but only if u are on their position top
[05:19:12] <Gregoric> henn1nk you mean such effect? johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/
[05:19:37] <henn1nk> Gregoric: yes but just simplier: http://jsfiddle.net/MkJwm/
[05:20:06] <henn1nk> Gregoric: but in this example it doesnt care about where the div element is positioned
[05:20:19] <henn1nk> Gregoric: because i would like to slide in different dics
[05:20:20] <henn1nk> divs
[05:20:25] <Gregoric> Well, I cannot really help you much but I remember I had bookmarked such an effect once so here I've shown you :)
[05:21:01] <Gregoric> Maybe it has something to do with z-index? I do not know
[05:21:12] <henn1nk> dont think so
[05:21:18] <henn1nk> but wait i search an example
[05:21:26] <Rockwood> http://jsfiddle.net/57GhS/ is not working please can you check what is wrong in it?
[05:22:22] <Rockwood> somebody please help me
[05:23:03] <henn1nk> Gregoric: http://www.mrvisual.info
[05:23:37] <ocx> i would like to add some php code call on the following jquery sand (on click event) www.hipernation.com (upper right filter) how can i do that? thanks
[05:24:27] <ocx> what i would like to call on click event is this: http://pastebin.com/0F2quZw6
[05:24:29] <Gregoric> henn1nk, so you would like the divs to not be slided back when scrolling up?
[05:24:51] <henn1nk> Gregoric: i just want to slide them in during scrolling down :P
[05:25:33] <Rockwood> somebody please help me
[05:26:07] <Gregoric> henn1nk, that's doable, but I have no real experience with jQ so I cannot help you at the moment :)
[05:27:29] <henn1nk> ah i know how, Gregoric .
[05:29:39] <Rockwood> somebody please help me

[05:33:31] <DrPoole> such a simple thing
[05:33:32] <loopsdeer> Rockwood: what's your question?
[05:33:36] <DrPoole> been owning me for 2 days
[05:33:47] <Rockwood> http://jsfiddle.net/57GhS/ is not working please can you check what is wrong in it?
[05:33:59] <DrPoole> i have table rows that when clicked fire this function.  the result is always the same.
[05:34:13] <DrPoole> if i change the callback=foobar in the URL it will show me the proper response.
[05:34:27] <DrPoole> so im caching somehow
[05:34:31] <Rockwood> @loopsdeer   http://jsfiddle.net/57GhS/ is not working please can you check what is wrong in it?
[05:34:34] <DrPoole> going crazy
[05:35:36] <mrHAT> is there any method such as n.toFixed() that would return int instead of a string ?
[05:35:36] <loopsdeer> Rockwood: It's not going to work in jsfiddle cuz success.wav doesn't exist
[05:36:11] <Rockwood> Timestamp: 7/30/2013 5:46:15 PM Error: SyntaxError: syntax error Source File: http://fiddle.jshell.net/_display/ Line: 29, Column: 5 Source Code:     ();}
[05:36:33] <Rockwood> It is also mot working on my local system
[05:37:59] <seutje> Rockwood: missing a ); at the end
[05:38:16] <seutje> you're doind $(function {};
[05:38:20] <seutje> doing
[05:38:31] <Rockwood> ok
[05:38:35] <seutje> also. audio elements don't have a attr method
[05:38:46] <seutje> you're probably looking for a jQuery collection, those tend to have that
[05:39:04] <seutje> or get/setAttribute
[05:39:34] <Rockwood> so what should i do in it to make it work?
[05:39:35] <ML74> Does anyone have any experience with uniformjs? Particularly getting jQuery change functions to work with checkboxes?
[05:40:11] <seutje> actually, readystate is a property, not an attribute
[05:40:27] <Gregoric> slax0r, do you have some idea how to fix my problem above?
[05:40:33] <seutje> Rockwood: http://jsfiddle.net/57GhS/4/
[05:41:30] <seutje> Rockwood: also note that readyState isn't a boolean, but instead has like 5 possible states
[05:41:46] <seutje> and readyState 1 isn't enough to start playing
[05:41:52] <Rockwood> ok
[05:42:00] <Rockwood> then?
[05:42:18] <seutje> `mdn readystate
[05:42:19] <b-ot> seutje: document.readyState - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.readyState
[05:43:32] <fRAiLtY-> If I wanted to do some validation, how could I slot it in with this plugin to ensure that on clicking the link (line 18 html) that it checks the validation first, then fires the upload event? http://jsfiddle.net/SbZXC/
[05:43:48] <ML74> Does anyone have any experience with uniformjs? Particularly getting jQuery change functions to work with checkboxes?
[05:44:03] <seutje> Rockwood:  I meant this one: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement
[05:44:21] <Rockwood> ok checking
[05:44:44] <seutje> scroll down to readystate and u can see it's generally best to wait till readystate 4 before you can start playing the audio/video
[05:46:27] <Rockwood> where to define readystate value?
[05:46:52] <seutje> you don't define it, it's read only
[05:47:09] <seutje> it's the browser telling you how much data it has already received
[05:47:43] <Rockwood> so what should i do so that it begin to work
[05:48:26] <Rockwood> can you set a example for it
[05:48:26] <seutje> I dunno, it works as is, but I'm assuming that alert isn't your final production functionality and u actually wanna play it
[05:49:51] <Rockwood> yes i just want to play a sound with alert popup on pageload function
[05:50:18] <Rockwood> if the conditions are true for related phpcode
[05:50:33] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/57GhS/5/
[05:50:34] <yuka> i have a jquery slider, and on first load in modern browsers I get this error: S_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE: Component is not available, after refresh its ok, anybody has any guidelines on how to fix this?
[05:51:56] <seutje> yuka: the plugin doesn't properly wait for images to load and tries to get at their data before it's there, the second refresh, the images are loaded from cache, making the data available when the plugin wants to get at it
[05:52:01] <seutje> ... I think
[05:52:08] <yuka> NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE: Component is not available [Prekini ob tej napaki] 	  B.drawImage(f[0], b, y, U, z);
[05:52:26] <yuka> yeah I think you are right, however I can see on the begining of plugin, there is a waitforimages function
[05:53:25] <seutje> yuka: does this occur in anything but firefox?
[05:53:42] <seutje> also, what's the plugin called?
[05:54:09] <yuka> yeah, it happens in other browsers aswell,  http://pastebin.com/TPXs2Ty9
[05:54:47] <davesleep> when i use nth-child, how do i select a range?
[05:55:05] <davesleep> nth-child(n>2 && n<6)
[05:55:12] <davesleep> or something along those lines?
[05:55:13] <seutje> yuka: oh my, is that the plugin?
[05:55:18] <yuka> seutje : http://pastebin.com/tZbNr9k7 <- this is the whole plugin
[05:55:24] <yuka> that is just the wait function
[05:56:09] <Rockwood> @seutje Thnaks it is working now.
[05:56:17] <Rockwood> Thanks*
[05:56:20] <yuka> if you could help me fix this mate, I would be so very gratefull .))
[05:56:30] <seutje> yuka: this is pretty gross, I'd refrain from using this plugin :x
[05:56:42] <seutje> the waitForImagesLoaded isn't defined in here btw
[05:58:38] <yuka> I know this is ugly code, but I haven't found any other thing that would do what I wanted
[05:59:42] <platzhirsch> do you think * is a nice parameter value for meaning all values?
[06:02:10] <seutje> davesleep: http://nthmaster.com/
[06:03:56] <davesleep> got it under 'slice'
[06:04:30] <seutje> didn't u want a range of element to be matched by a css selector?
[06:05:05] <davesleep> slice works no?
[06:05:29] <davesleep> ah yes, n+6 also works,
[06:06:30] <yuka> seutje i'll give you paypal donation if you can help me fix this (if the fix is possible with such ugly code)
[06:06:34] <yuka> I am desperate :)
[06:07:20] <seutje> yuka: sry, I'm just checking this channel in between DB dumps and such, can't really spend too much time on things... and I don't even have a paypal account :P
[06:07:49] <yuka> well :) Ill donate some money to anybody who helps me fix this, is the last thing i need to launch project

[06:10:48] <sammych> sheesh. the ':first' jQuery pseudo-selector is useless
[06:11:46] <sammych> http://jsperf.com/jquery-first-vs-first-vs-eq-0-vs-0/2
[06:15:24] <nFFF> pretty negligable
[06:15:32] <nFFF> maybe its more readable
[06:16:12] <sammych> I suppose underneath it all it's still looking up the whole DOM
[06:16:28] <nFFF> yes
[06:16:34] <nFFF> perhaps you loose a fw ops/sec
[06:16:38] <sammych> probably the parsing of the query taking up all speed
[06:16:43] <sammych> selector*
[06:16:46] <nFFF> but it probably doesn't have any real world consequence
[06:16:46] <sammych> query*
[06:16:53] <nFFF> compared to how readable your code might be
[06:17:17] <sammych> well, JS is pretty verbose
[06:17:30] <sammych> document.getElementByTagNames('div')[0]
[06:17:42] <sammych> oops, that 's' be in the wrong spot ;)
[06:18:13] <titii> Pls some one can help me? In the jsfiddle that doesnt works, so i put it on my server http://test.kreon.sk/alt-click.html. Thank U

[06:42:19] <sammych> you must have a big ass screen
[06:42:27] <Anticom> hi all. I'm coding on a calendar application using full calendar. Now i wanted to use Pines Notify for some feedback on event creation, update, etc.
[06:42:48] <Anticom> Problem is, that as soon as i include the pines.js without even actually using it, the calendar doesn't get rendered anymore
[06:43:01] <Anticom> but there are no errors shown in the console
[06:43:08] <henn1nk> shoky: thanks
[06:43:15] <Anticom> what could be causing that problem and how to possibly solve it
[06:43:16] <Anticom> ?
[06:46:26] <Granjow> shoky: Thanks, found it, works. Sent a patch to the documentation: https://github.com/Granjow/api.jquery.com/compare/jquery:master...patch-1?quick_pull=1
[06:47:57] <sonOfRa> Is it possible to wildcard-delete classes? I have a whole set of classes like something-color, and for some drag/drop action, I want to delete those classes while being dragged over with something like removeClass("*-color");
[06:48:35] <shoky> sounds like you need more classes
[06:48:47] <sonOfRa> does something like this exist, or should I just put all the classes in there, or, third way, try to detect which class is currently applied and delete only that? (The last attempt seems very resource-heavy, though)
[06:48:49] <shoky> e.g.  class="color red"
[06:51:17] <sonOfRa> alright, kinda tried to avoid more classes, but that will definitely work
[06:52:20] <sonOfRa> hm, that doesn't really solve the problem of them being deleted though, since I still have to delete all colors, since I don't know which one I currently have
[06:52:49] <sammych> maybe you can just split them
[06:53:42] <sammych> iterate/map over it, return blank for the matches, and set className .join(' ') back
[06:54:40] <shoky> you don't have to delete all colors
[06:54:43] <shoky> just .removeClass('color')
[06:55:10] <sammych> or that. have 'color' be an 'enabler' class?
[06:55:23] <sammych> is there a word for that?
[06:55:51] <sonOfRa> oh, that makes sense, good idea
[06:55:53] <shoky> "class" is the word, really ;p
[06:55:53] <sammych> like .color.red { border-color:red }
[06:56:18] <sammych> but it's more of a technique
[06:56:44] <shoky> technique of classification ;p
[06:57:03] <holy_war_profite> Hey, I'm trying to make a div inner box-shadow grow in a loop, I can't figure out the proper .css I need to use for it. Here's the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Skpm4/
[06:58:12] <sammych> fine fine
[06:58:30] <sammych> css3 transistion :)
[07:02:23] <sammych> holy_war_profite: http://jsfiddle.net/Skpm4/1/
[07:03:08] <sammych> 'this' is local to every function
[07:03:34] <sammych> so your $(this) inside the setInterval isn't what you think it is
[07:03:51] <holy_war_profite> hmm
[07:04:17] <holy_war_profite> so is it a function object
[07:04:47] <obert> a function obert
[07:04:57] <sammych> every time you see 'function' that creates a scope/closure
[07:05:25] <sammych> a function is an object
[07:05:50] <obert> and a method is a function
[07:06:11] <holywarprofiteer> word
[07:06:20] <holywarprofiteer> thanks all
[07:06:28] <sammych> nw
[07:10:46] <obert> can i say that i hate cheap hosting?
[07:11:57] <NoiseEee> yes obert, its 2013, theres no reason to choose a 'cheap host' over a vps
[07:12:17] <obert> depends on the budget
[07:12:33] <NoiseEee> if you can't afford $25/month, you can't afford being a developer imo
[07:14:16] <obert> 25 is huge
[07:14:20] <sammych> can get a VPS for $10/month
[07:14:59] <NoiseEee> well maybe you're a youngster or something, but i should think everyone can afford $25 a month
[07:15:04] <NoiseEee> buy one less energy drink a week or something.
[07:15:15] <sammych> I'm saving up to buy the new Mac Pro
[07:15:17] <obert> if it is just a small site there is no reason to rent a vps and i can continue to be a developer
[07:15:22] <sammych> that $25 month could totally go towards that
[07:15:46] <NoiseEee> sammych: yeah at that rate you'll get that Mac Pro by 2024!
[07:15:56] * sammych opens calculator
[07:16:16] <sammych> 16 years, depending on your model ;)
[07:18:11] <obert> and anyway seems that your talking is a bit rude NoiseEee
[07:18:45] <sammych> and he's stereotyping us devs
[07:18:56] <sammych> thinking we chugg energy drinks
[07:19:33] <sammych> I do coke
[07:19:58] <sonOfRa> Honestly, even VPS just gets on my nerves... The 50€ instead of 20€ for an actual server was worth the money
[07:20:29] <sonOfRa> VPS performance on shared machines goes to crap so often, sometimes my net I/O was faster than disk I/O
[07:21:32] <seutje> I should really move all my shit to a vps
[07:22:18] <sammych> I know a guy in HK who has gigabit
[07:22:37] <sammych> so I just get him to host stuff
[07:22:50] <sammych> (mind you, I'm in Australia)
[07:23:22] <obert> do you know if email address js protection could help a bit?
[07:23:45] <obert> or if it is just decent to print a mailto:real@address in the markup?
[07:24:07] <slax0r> if you enjoy spam mail..
[07:24:24] <obert> js doesnt seems to be a good protection in this case
[07:24:54] <slax0r> best protection is not to provide an email address at all
[07:25:07] <slax0r> it's far better to spit out a contact form, and bot-protect that one
[07:25:08] <obert> same old story then
[07:25:13] <sonOfRa> you're lucky if you're allowed to do that
[07:25:22] <sonOfRa> Can't do that if you're hosting a .de site...
[07:25:26] <ravenzz> well gmail & co spam filters are quite good these days
[07:25:37] <Anticom> :(
[07:25:41] <slax0r> as long as it's for my website,...
[07:25:49] <slax0r> and if a law says I must put on a mail
[07:25:53] <sonOfRa> you are obligated by LAW to put an email address where you can actually be reached
[07:26:03] <slax0r> then..well..you're...
[07:26:05] <sammych> js> print('prevention' > 'cure')
[07:26:11] <b-ot> sammych: true
[07:26:19] <ravenzz> I have the facebook one for spam/website related stuff
[07:26:46] <obert> facebook is a sick world
[07:27:18] <ravenzz> a recruiter from a big company asked my "so you work for facebook.com why would you work for us?"
[07:27:42] <slax0r> lolz...and you replied: nah...I changed my mind :D
[07:27:44] <ravenzz> and I was like *facepalm*
[07:28:08] <seutje> lol
[07:28:25] <seutje> 2013 and ppl are still attempting spam protection by hiding their address?
[07:28:37] <ravenzz> slax0r tech recruiters are like secretaries lol
[07:28:40] <sammych> so, what email addresses do fb employees get?
[07:28:46] <ravenzz> fb.com
[07:29:20] <slax0r> not at my place... :P
[07:29:35] <ML74> Does anyone have any experience with uniformjs? Particularly getting jQuery change functions to work with checkboxes?
[07:31:24] <ravenzz> slax0r well they just search for candidates, arrange the interviews, collect feedbacks from engineers (the one who perfrom the interviews) and email the candidate, book you a flight etc
[07:31:56] <Anticom> anyone worked with full calendar and pines notify in combination before?
[07:32:03] <Anticom> i just can't see why it's not working :/
[07:32:30] <slax0r> we can see just good why it's not working
[08:13:01] <sunbeam> whats the easiest way now a days to display tweets with jquery plugin?
[08:13:27] <sunbeam> I have the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret
[08:14:26] <Jabberwock> http://tweet.seaofclouds.com/
[08:14:33] <Jabberwock> first google result. Never used it though.
[08:16:51] <sunbeam> tried em all
[08:16:54] <sunbeam> "Twitter has discontinued its unauthenticated v1.0 API, so this widget has stopped working as of 2013-06-11. "
[08:18:26] <tw2113> find oauth libs that don't try to use the 1.0 api :P
[08:18:37] <motaka2> What does jquery cache does exactely ?
[08:19:26] <ajmrsn> it does what it does
[08:19:41] <tw2113> or change the 1 line you need to make it point to 1.1, i'd be surprised if those oauth things wouldn't work with both
[08:19:53] <smart1> hi there, i got a litle problem. if i use xxx.append("<div>");  it add a complete div tag, included the closing one
[08:21:20] <smart1> because of my recursive code structure i want to call something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/unmaF/ but the result is totally wrong
[08:21:26] <NoiseEee> smart1: var div = $('<div>');   div.append(somethingElse); xxx.append(div);
[08:21:49] <smart1> not working without totally restructuring the code
[08:21:53] <sunbeam> tw2113: ok thanks
[08:22:16] <NoiseEee> smart1: think about it.  you actually want to append to the div, and THEN append the div.
[08:22:41] <smart1> i want to append some text, but jquery starts interpreting this as a tag
[08:22:45] <smart1> which it shouldnt
[08:23:02] <smart1> is there another solution to aappend some "text"
[08:23:04] <NoiseEee> smart1: for that matter, you can get what you're after with $('.test').html('<div><a href="#">hi</a></div>')
[08:23:15] <NoiseEee> smart1: it does everything correctly, you're just doing it wrong / not thinking about it correctly.
[08:23:15] <rjonesx> Is it appropriate to ask JQPlot questions here?
[08:23:59] <smart1> NoiseEee, i'm using an api which dies the second append call. so i have to sourround it by a div
[08:23:59] <motaka2> what does it mean when you set cache:true in $.ajax? what does it cache exactely?
[08:24:05] <NoiseEee> smart1: for that matter, you can get what you're after with $('.test').html('<div><a href="#">hi</a></div>')
[08:24:54] <smart1> motaka2:  you're caching the file you requested by ajax and dont reload it by reloading the site or rerunning the function
[08:25:55] <d0den> Using the slider widget from jquery mobile, is there a way to get the value for the slider after it has been touched but before it has been released?
[08:25:56] <motaka2> smart1: sometimes I need to change a part of a page in browser according to a click of a user, should I use cache yet ?
[08:27:04] <smart1> <motaka2>: depends of your usage. if you get some data which change, dont cache. you load static data by ajax, cache
[08:29:35] <jop008> I am a looking for an image carousel working in all browsers and can have a title with a picture and for free :-)
[08:29:47] <jop008> I googled a lot but I can not find a winner
[08:30:02] <slax0r> would you like fried with that? :P
[08:30:05] <slax0r> fries*
[08:30:49] <slax0r> http://www.idangero.us/sliders/swiper/
[08:32:00] <smart1> <NoiseEee>, not working, this is just an exaple. i'm using an api call which generates some content and append it to an object. it looks more like this:http://jsfiddle.net/unmaF/1/
[08:32:53] <smart1> the problem is , i have to sorround. i already tried: var x = $('.test').append("<div>"); renderTrainings(xml, $x); but this isnt working
[08:33:10] <smart1> $x = x, misstyped
[08:33:34] <andrew9183> i dont understand your question smart1
[08:34:57] <NoiseEee> me neither.
[08:35:13] <smart1> andrew9183, renderTrainings(a,b) appends some content from a to the object b. now i want to surround the renderTrainings(a,b); output with a div.
[08:35:16] <NoiseEee> smart1: sounds like you're appending things out of order / appending to the wrong thing.
[08:35:18] <motaka2> smart1: Thank you thats the answer I was looking for
[08:35:23] <tw2113> i'm curious why smart1 feels need to make the div separately
[08:35:36] <motaka2> smart1: introduce me with a good book for javascript
[08:35:38] <motaka2> please
[08:36:20] <tw2113> make renderTrainings have it as part of the output
[08:36:30] <tw2113> unless it's used elsewhere that needs no divs
[08:36:53] <smart1> renderTrainings is an function of an api, so i dont have access to change the code
[08:37:31] <smart1> the thing i really don't understand is, why i cannot append just "<div>". not as a tag , as text.
[08:37:45] <NoiseEee> what is a <div> if not a tag?
[08:37:45] <tw2113>  var x = $('.test').append("<div>"+renderTrainings(a,b)+"</div>");
[08:37:53] <NoiseEee> thank you tw2113.
[08:39:02] <smart1> tw2113, this would work if renderTrainings returns somthing
[08:39:14] <smart1> this function append something to b
[08:39:59] <tw2113> don't make b return something yet, and throw that in place of renderTrainings() in the append
[08:40:17] <tw2113> or i dunno :D
[08:40:22] <smart1> renderTraining is a void function, so no return
[08:40:32] <tw2113> what an asshole function
[08:40:36] <smart1> i know -.-
[08:41:21] <jop008> Looks cool this http://www.idangero.us/sliders/swiper/
[08:41:32] <jop008> but can it have titles under the photo?
[08:42:05] <_Odin_> Err how would I allow for overflow in a JQ-UI dialog widget?
[08:42:21] <gho5t> c to the ss
[08:42:24] <tw2113> any *good* carousel/slider/whathaveyou will allow for non pic markup in it
[08:42:28] <smart1> <motaka2>, hmm, i really dont know a good book. there are thousand of blogs about jquery. soyou dont have to know javascript to use jquery :D
[08:42:28] <_Odin_> Oh is that it?
[08:42:29] <_Odin_> nice
[08:42:34] <_Odin_> thanks gho5t
[08:43:03] <tw2113> also, jop008, if you actually go through the slides at the top, it says "slide with html"
[08:43:07] <tw2113> aka yes, you can
[08:43:23] <jop008> Yes  I saw
[08:43:24] <smart1> NoiseEee, http://jsfiddle.net/unmaF/3/ version 3 doesn't work too.
[08:43:27] <jop008> is it free?
[08:43:36] <smart1> that's what you recommend , right?
[08:43:40] <tw2113> what does the little blue ribbon in the upper right say?
[08:44:20] <jop008> Yes albums possible?
[08:44:30] <tw2113> dunno, keep reading!
[08:44:37] <motaka2> smart1: I want to read javascript the good parts, it seems to be good but of 2008, may you check to see if the content is good or not ?
[08:44:37] <tw2113> i'm not going to read the page for you
[08:44:50] <tw2113> motaka2, JS the Good Parts, is going to still be valid
[08:45:02] <tw2113> the author is a PRETTY well known guy
[08:45:31] <tw2113> he only created some little thing named JSON or something
[08:46:33] <NoiseEee> smart1: it works fine.
[08:46:57] <jop008> Can't find album but you can add it yourself
[08:48:05] <NoiseEee> smart1: but it seeeeems you wanted http://jsfiddle.net/unmaF/4/
[08:48:51] <NoiseEee> smart1: or conversely, http://jsfiddle.net/unmaF/5/
[08:49:11] <motaka2> tw2113: thank you
[08:55:43] <d0den> is there a way to make the jquery mobile slider have a scale that follows a log distribution, for a volume slider?
[08:57:29] <smart1> <NoiseEee>, 5th version works fine, thx. but i'm wondering why this is working. i thought $("<div>") means "<div>" is a selector of jquery and selects all divs, i didn't expected that this will create a temporary element too
[08:58:09] <smart1> thx alot for helping here :)
[09:01:35] <NoiseEee> smart1: you're just appending to the wrong thing / not quite grokking append
[09:01:55] <NoiseEee> and $('<div>') means a "new" div tag
[09:02:40] <smart1> pk, thanks alot
[09:10:21] <horrror> hi, i'm using slice() to remove last two elements inside a div. it works perfectly fine. When removing those elements I want to  remove its next 'br' of each of them, how should I do this?
[09:11:32] <bahamas> what's the best way to update a form values with data received through ajax?
[09:11:49] <bahamas> looping through the form's input fields?
[09:12:45] <gho5t> data-binding
[09:13:50] <BillCriswell> horrror: Are you sure you mean next? You mean like.. the first immediate child <br> of the two you cut off?
[09:14:07] <horrror> not child, but next element
[09:14:28] <bahamas> gho5t: can you elaborate?
[09:14:31] <gho5t> bahamas: that seems to be your best bet as there is now "deserialize" function for forms
[09:14:53] <gho5t> I was saying you could use a data-binding lib like knockout or angularjs
[09:14:55] <BillCriswell> You chopped off the last two divs, right?  How can any of them be a <br>?
[09:14:57] <gho5t> but might be overkill
[09:16:02] <bahamas> gho5t: ah, yes. I also don't have any experience with them
[09:16:07] <BillCriswell> horrror: I think I got you now. My bad. How about... $removedEls.next('<br>').remove() ?
[09:18:31] <BillCriswell> horrror: http://jsbin.com/iqogas/1/edit like this?
[09:20:02] <vsync_> iliketurtles also
[09:21:12] <horrror> BillCriswell: great thx
[09:22:28] <jop008> Can you set the widht height on this dynamicly depending on database content? http://www.idangero.us/sliders/swiper/api.php
[09:27:04] <Al1> hello
[09:33:16] <Al1> need help to figure out how to disable start button if field is empty but once it gets filled out to re-activate - https://gist.github.com/albertpak/42b2e28365ee5259180b#file-addldata-js
[09:34:04] <Al1> after i click on start, it gets attribute of disabled, and then when i go back to the field and fill it out - it still stays disabled
[09:39:32] <Al1> anyone?
[09:41:08] <scootklein> hi everyone, seeing some strange behavior where manually triggering a resize event causes the window to scroll immediately to the top of the page
[09:41:13] <scootklein> using $(window).trigger('resize')
[09:50:26] <d0den> is there a way I can alter the scale of a jquery slider to make it exponential instead of linear?
[09:50:43] <pachet> that's above our level of clearance
[09:51:11] <orentanay>  I'm using jQueryUI accordion, each pane containing a form, and using the validate plugin to validate the forms and move to the next step. I'm getting a JS error every time I try to advance to the next pane. I'm sure I'm missing something simple, can someone let me know what I'm doing wrong? Thanks. http://pastebin.com/texzR0WQ
[09:51:14] <d0den> pachet, how do you mean
[09:56:12] <tvw> What do I need, when I want to develop cross-platform (on PCs, smartphones and tablets)? jQuery mobile seems to be only for mobile devices while jQuery and jQuery-UI only for PCs. Or am I wrong?
[09:56:47] <arschmitz> tvw: jquery mobile will work anywhere
[09:56:52] <Al1> anyone here?
[09:57:13] <arschmitz> but it may or may not be what your looking for because its a whole framework
[09:57:22] <tvw> So I only need jquery mobile?
[09:57:32] <arschmitz> tvw: also jquery is for anywhere both jquery mobile and jquery ui use jquery
[09:59:26] <tvw> So when I use jquery ui it also works on touch enabled devices? So sliders will work everywhere?
[10:02:49] <tvw> I tried the jQuery UI demos: It does not work at least on my HP Pre and Touchpad.
[10:03:19] <arschmitz> tvw: no
[10:03:36] <arschmitz> jquery ui does not support touch yet only mobile
[10:07:26] <orentanay>  I'm using jQueryUI accordion, each pane containing a form, and using the validate plugin to validate the forms and move to the next step. I'm getting a JS error every time I try to advance to the next pane. I'm sure I'm missing something simple, can someone let me know what I'm doing wrong? Thanks. http://pastebin.com/texzR0WQ
[10:07:54] <_Odin_> How would I append something to a div, and then force the entire program to wait for the image to load before doing anything else?
[10:16:05] <orentanay> i'm trying to call jq ui accordion 'activate' in my jq validate submitHandler, but I get the error msg "Error: no such method 'activate' for accordion widget instance". Any thoughts? Here is how I'm calling the accordion change pane: homeSchoolAccordion.accordion('activate', currentPos + 1);   and here is the full JS http://pastebin.com/texzR0WQ
[10:17:54] <tvw> So jquery ui is not cross platform, I see. Then I have to use JQuery mobile instead. The various frameworks and its uses are a bit confusing. I would expect jQuery mobile for mobile use only.
[10:27:54] <Danwe_WMDE> I just got a little deeper into jQuery's internals and just got really aware that each time jQuery.fn.pushStack gets called by any jQurey.fn. member, a whole copy of the jquery object is being done. It seems like most jQuery optimization tips do not consider this. When they recommend using something like $( '.foo' ).not( '.bar' ) instead of $( '.foo:not(.bar)' ), this might be a good tip on CPU critcal tasks but can lead to much higher
[10:27:54] <Danwe_WMDE> memory usage when operating on sets with lots of DOM nodes, or am I missing something?
[10:49:10] <BillCriswell> Danwe_WMDE: Might be a better thing for #jquery-dev?
[10:49:31] <Danwe_WMDE> BillCriswell: probably. thanks
[10:50:12] <BillCriswell> Yurp.
[11:24:53] <jop008> is there something in jquery scrollintoView?
[11:30:39] <jop008> I found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4884839/how-do-i-get-a-element-to-scroll-into-view-using-jquery works this also for jqmobile?
[11:40:20] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I'm using an older version of jQuery that uses $.ajax()'s 'error" and 'success' object values. What would cause my 'error' to get trigged but nothing shows up in the Network tab in Chrome under XHR?
[11:41:52] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: cross-domain issue maybe. not getting an error msg?
[11:42:07] <shoky> also, what're the arguments to the error callback
[11:42:55] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Not cross-domain, it's using a relative path. The only error message I'm getting is the alert() in my error:    Let me paste the code
[11:43:25] <shoky> the error callback gets called with certain arguments. log those
[11:43:34] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Ah, I see
[11:44:09] <naeluh> what up !
[11:44:11] <DeltaHeavy> Regardless here's the paste. http://bpaste.net/show/fK9F4DKPGMUVdHiGVnFr/     What I'm doing is kinda derpy because it's an e-commerce platform hack.
[11:46:36] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: The first param seems to be more or less empty with a 'status' value of 0. The second param is just 'error' and the third is 'undefined'
[11:46:54] <Bloomberg> Hi guys!!
[11:46:57] <DeltaHeavy> As far as I can tell my syntax is right, but idk since I havn't done an AJAX call of this style for a long while.
[11:47:12] <Bloomberg> Someone here know how can I view a document online inside a modal window?
[11:48:06] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: donno, would need to see it live
[11:48:20] <DeltaHeavy> Which isn't quite possible >:
[11:48:26] <DeltaHeavy> Damn, what's going on ;_;
[11:48:35] <shoky> you sure you don't see the request anywhere in the network tab?
[11:49:00] <DeltaHeavy> 100%
[11:49:03] <DeltaHeavy> I've been at this for like 40misn
[11:49:06] <DeltaHeavy> mins*
[11:49:59] <Bloomberg> some like fancybox with documents viewer
[11:52:12] <imdea> Hi, I'm trying to use jquery validator but it seems that my validate function is not executing. Here is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/sfsd5/1/  any idea?
[11:52:39] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: and you're not viewing the site based off the filesystem, right
[11:53:00] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Viewing the site based off the filesystem?
[11:53:08] <DeltaHeavy> I'm viewing it via my browser, Chrome.
[11:53:23] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: i mean, like a file:/// url  instead of on a webserver
[11:53:28] <DeltaHeavy> Nope, it's remote.
[11:53:44] <shoky> k.. no idea without seeing it
[11:53:51] <DeltaHeavy> GUESS JQUERY IS BROKEN
[11:53:55] <DeltaHeavy> *breaks out into rage*
[11:54:16] <shoky> ;p
[11:54:51] <orentanay> with jq ui accordion, I'm trying to disable all the h3 links of the current and future panes, but make the h3 links work for previous tabs. Any thoughts?
[11:55:17] <Bloomberg> someone could give me some idea?
[11:55:25] <neataroni> any guess why .animate() is kind of choppy on my macbook retina display, but smooth as a whistle on an external monitor?
[11:55:26] <imdea> anyone?
[11:56:37] <DeltaHeavy> neataroni: mo pixels mo problems
[11:56:57] <neataroni> DeltaHeavy: oh- good point
[11:57:12] <shoky> imdea: you need your inputs to have a "name" attribute
[11:57:17] <blindMoe> imdea: http://jsfiddle.net/sfsd5/3/
[11:57:20] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Ha.
[11:57:23] <blindMoe> imdea: name="givenname"
[11:57:56] <DeltaHeavy> Gah, my error shows up if I get a 404 but not if it's found
[11:58:03] <imdea> where in the documentation appears that
[11:58:18] <blindMoe> imdea: read the docs and you will find it ;)
[11:58:40] <blindMoe> imdea: not to mention you need to have name fields anyway
[11:58:40] <shoky> imdea: form inputs always use "name" for the input names, anyway
[11:58:46] <imdea> blindMoe, jquery validator documentation you mean?
[11:58:59] <BillCriswell> I kind of wish some of these plugins had a couple questions to answer before you're allowed to download it.
[11:59:13] <imdea> blindMoe, why? i thought only id was needed
[11:59:29] <blindMoe> you thought wrong
[11:59:42] <BillCriswell> I'm talking dead simple questions.
[11:59:53] <blindMoe> BillCriswell: +1 on that
[12:01:11] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell: do you know how can I get view a document in a modal window instead of download it?
[12:01:53] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: It depends heavily on the kind of document. You can view HTML documents in them pretty easily.
[12:02:18] <Bloomberg> But for example if you have pdf and doc documents
[12:02:34] <imdea> blindMoe, just being curious about this, where does it says that name attribute is mandatory in forms?
[12:02:41] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: you don't get to view those in browser, those are for plugins.
[12:02:44] <DeltaHeavy> Bloomberg: Not all browsers can read PDFs
[12:03:00] <blindMoe> imdea: how else would you read the data from that field on the server side?
[12:03:18] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/ could work I guess? I never tried it... seems scary.
[12:03:24] <shoky> imdea: any document about html forms would say that. also http://jqueryvalidation.org/validate talks about " Key is the name of an element"  for example. name, not id
[12:03:28] <BillCriswell> DOC's... no idea.
[12:03:43] <BillCriswell> Fucking Ween is so awesome.
[12:04:11] <imdea> blindMoe, yes of course, but I mean, in terms of javascript and jquery, why when you put name attribute it works? isn't 'name' designed to be used server side and 'id' in client-side?
[12:04:15] <NoiseEee> i liked a couple records, big on Quebec @ BillCriswell
[12:04:33] <BillCriswell> Listening to Chocolate and Cheese currently.
[12:04:47] <blindMoe> imdea: both work.. in your case.. jquery validate uses the name field.. end of story
[12:04:54] <BillCriswell> You really don't get more diverse than Ween.
[12:05:48] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: Freedom of '76 best soul song not released in the 70s
[12:06:09] <imdea> blindMoe, thank you very much :)
[12:06:42] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Agreed. What makes it even better it's about my home town.
[12:06:47] <BillCriswell> is it's about*
[12:06:50] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: nice!
[12:08:03] <BillCriswell> They formed not too far from me. Know some people who know some people who know them kind of deal.
[12:08:45] <Bloomberg> I have this and show me "missing } after property list"
[12:08:46] <Bloomberg> $(document).ready(function(){     $(".formServices").fancybox({ 	href: "<?php echo $route.$row['rutaservicio'];?>", 	}); });
[12:10:01] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: why not look at the rendered source?
[12:10:37] <Bloomberg> NoiseEee: I doon't understand you, what are you saying?
[12:11:12] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: You're still putting in that courtesy comma as well. Cut that crap out!
[12:11:16] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: look at that line of javascript as seen in "view source"  (without the PHP garbage / with pHP rendered as html)
[12:11:17] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: He's suggesting to look at it after PHP is finished.
[12:36:02] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Apparently "cancelled" AJAX requests don't show up in the XHR tab. It's showing up under 'All' with teh status of 'Cancelled' all greyed out.
[12:36:21] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know about this?
[12:39:57] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: is a form being submitted maybe?
[12:40:06] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: This is on page load
[12:40:14] <DeltaHeavy> Nothing to do with a form
[12:41:55] <shoky> try pasting more code, adunno
[12:42:04] <DeltaHeavy> http://bpaste.net/show/fK9F4DKPGMUVdHiGVnFr/
[12:42:17] <DeltaHeavy> This is all that's involved. That's just wrapped in a $(document).ready()
[12:42:49] <shoky> does removing the timeout do anything
[12:43:30] <DeltaHeavy> YES @_@
[12:43:31] <DeltaHeavy> WHY
[12:43:32] <DeltaHeavy> WHU
[12:44:01] <shoky> the error happens immediately?
[12:44:06] <DeltaHeavy> It did yes
[12:44:15] <DeltaHeavy> Right after the document loads (document.ready
[12:44:30] <shoky> what jquery version btw
[12:45:00] <DeltaHeavy> 1.4.4
[12:45:33] <shoky> well... use something newer :\
[12:45:55] <DeltaHeavy> Can't
[12:46:05] <DeltaHeavy> Interspire e-commerce framework ftw
[12:46:28] <DeltaHeavy> I've tried before >->
[12:57:49] <Bigawuc> Anyone not busy wanna work on something?
[13:28:21] <majuscule> ~Is there any reason that I can't seem to simultaniously animate the dimensions and margins of an element? Unlike other properties, these seem to be sequential regardless
[13:48:35] <Toerkeium> hello guys. How can I make so when an jqueryui accordion uncollapses, I add a marging of for example 20px so it's separated from the botton widget?
[13:49:06] <garbagecollectio> https://gist.github.com/TheStriving/62c938072b7159077ab2
[13:49:16] <garbagecollectio> will code put after that execute when all the animation is complete?
[13:49:25] <garbagecollectio> or like after it starts
[14:09:51] <Mrgoose> hey , i have a jquery mobile question.  I have about 20 "pages" in a single html page for multipage template.  The initial load of the dom takes a while.  Is it possible to cache that so that the "app" opens instnatly when i click the book mark on IOS
[14:13:50] <uGoMobi> Mrgoose: I wouldnt recommend to use a multipage template with 20 pages
[14:14:20] <Mrgoose> hmm, i thought single page templates were slower and lose transitions
[14:15:23] <uGoMobi> Mrgoose: no, we pull in content with AJAX and you can use transition
[14:15:44] <uGoMobi> and you have option to prefetch
[14:16:05] <Mrgoose> ah, well what would be the advantage of ever using multipage in that case?
[14:18:43] <gho5t> lazy loading
[14:18:46] <gho5t> ?
[14:27:27] <Mrgoose> uGoMobi, although the html for each page is fairly small, all of the content is ajax loaded
[14:27:35] <Mrgoose> would you still recommend against ?
[14:36:45] <imjakechapman> anyone lead me in the direction of organizing my js better without using something like backbone..
[14:36:52] <imjakechapman> only using functions when needed etc…
[14:37:06] <imjakechapman> I can't seem to find any solid articles anywhere that show best practices.
[14:39:04] <raphie> imjakechapman: honestly I'd bite the bullet and learn something else (I recommend Angular). jQuery is GREAT for DOM manipulation and the like, but it was never intended to provide structure for your app
[14:40:12] <imjakechapman> but a lot of the stuff i've been doing are way small… but there is just a lot of interaction as far as hit this button, run this function…
[14:40:23] <imjakechapman> no real dynamic data anywhere
[14:41:39] <raphie> the way I would do it is try to have as much separation of concerns as possible. have one file / module that is just the functions, and another module with a bunch of $("#myElem).click(myModule.myFun);
[14:41:52] <raphie> that way, if you ever decide to switch away from jQuery, you can still use the same functions
[14:43:13] <raphie> reasonable, imjakechapman?
[14:44:13] <imjakechapman> sorry let me read :)
[14:44:58] <imjakechapman> and whats the best way of including all of those files/modules?
[14:45:03] <imjakechapman> a js manifest file?
[14:45:56] <raphie> imjakechapman: well it depends on how advanced you need. requirejs is great if you have a ton of files and only want to load them when you need them
[14:47:05] <imjakechapman> alright, i'll take a look at require. I know that's what I've read in other places.. just looked quite confusing lol
[14:49:11] <raphie> imjakechapman: here's a really simple way to do modules that I use for most code: https://gist.github.com/RaphiePS/ab51d15f8b17e56bddc9
[14:49:18] <raphie> often you don't need the power of requirejs
[14:49:33] <raphie> this method is good because it doesn't pollute the global scope
[14:49:44] <raphie> and you can have private variables
[14:50:44] <imjakechapman> that looks nice
[14:51:00] <imjakechapman> and I can use jQuery within those modules since i'll be manipulating dom elements?
[14:51:06] <imjakechapman> well that was a dumb way to say that
[14:51:09] <imjakechapman> lol
[14:53:30] <raphie> imjakechapman: I would have modules that are exclusively logic and modules that are exclusively dom manipulation

[15:02:25] <Bogardo> Which version of jQuery are you using?
[15:02:35] <ValsiS> 1.8.3
[15:02:49] <ValsiS> i'm not very sure ...
[15:03:02] <ValsiS> anyway :P i don't use jquery for that :) i use my own js
[15:03:15] <Bogardo> Please check. jQuery dropped support for (older) IE browsers recently
[15:03:37] <Bogardo> Well, this is a jQuery IRC. So can't help you with that.
[15:04:05] <ValsiS> http://jsfiddle.net/aTumk/
[15:04:15] <ValsiS> if you know jquery :P you know js to
[15:04:47] <Bogardo> Nope.
[15:04:52] <Bogardo> No vanilla for me
[15:04:56] <ValsiS> :)
[15:28:14] <Xgear-> For some reason my submit even is being triggered twice through an ajax call, can't quite figure out why
[15:28:30] <Xgear-> If I test it on jsfiddle it isnt triggering twice through
[15:28:34] <Xgear-> though*
[15:32:40] <darthbator> Hey guys I am having some issues getting this jquery plugin here working the right way (https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie) I was wondering if anyone might be able to give me some help? I'm not seeing any errors. But I call the function in there to set cookies and they just never seem to set.
[15:35:06] <darthbator> here's the simple test script I have written to try and test functionality. It doesn't seem to be setting those cookies :_| https://gist.github.com/darthbator/6117681
[15:45:13] <shoky> darthbator: seems fine  http://jsfiddle.net/SwX3y/
[15:56:56] <Mrgoose> http://jquery-load-json.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/list.html
[15:57:48] <Mrgoose> any suggestions on loading a list with like 1000 items in it
[15:59:35] <retran> what's your question about it
[16:00:22] <naeluh> YO !
[16:04:58] <zamba> IE doesn't support the following code, why? http://pastie.org/8191614
[16:05:05] <zamba> i'm just getting NaN:NaN
[16:07:59] <Rubba> can i not select all checkboxes with the same name=""? has to be id/class?
[16:09:01] <zamba> looks like it doesn't like the new Date() with the argument
[16:12:41] <shoky> zamba: works fine for me on IE9
[16:13:46] <shoky> what's "started" ?
[16:16:02] <zamba> shoky: it's a variable from a php script
[16:16:14] <zamba> shoky: so i've included that in the script tag
[16:18:11] <shoky> zamba: what is the result from php that's stored in it, in javascript. a number?
[16:18:16] <tw2113> protip: if you're keeping the type attribute on your script tags, make sure it's "text/javascript"
[16:18:24] <tw2113> and not just "javascript"
[16:19:02] <shoky> wasted a couple hours on that one, a while back
[16:19:17] <zamba> shoky: it's a string with the following content: "2013-07-31 01:02:59"
[16:19:26] <tw2113> i thankfully only wasted 30 minutes, and i discovered it accidentally
[16:19:36] <tw2113> i was just cleaning up my unneeded attributes, and it suddenly worked
[16:20:09] <tw2113> eventually added the correct one back on, for legacy IE bs
[16:20:24] <zamba> shoky: looks like js in ie has issues creating a valid date using new Date("2013-07-31 01:02:59");
[16:24:10] <Xgear-> I can't freaking figure out why is this form submitting twice -_-
[16:26:43] <tfitts> in my app I have it setup so it shows a loading icon while an ajax request is processing.  I have a simple request I want to fire without showing the loading.  all of the google results I'm coming up with are about getting the loading icon there in the first place.
[16:26:50] <shoky> zamba: yeh
[16:28:55] <zamba> shoky: so i guess i have to rewrite this somehow
[16:29:39] <shoky> zamba: use timestamps
[16:29:50] <shoky> or parse the date yourself
[16:33:25] <zamba> shoky: you mean epoch timestamp?
[16:33:39] <Rubba> hi i'm trying to make it so when i toggle the toggle checkbox, the other checkboxes are all enabled/disabled - can someone help me out? http://jsfiddle.net/9x3Tp/1/
[16:38:21] <zamba> shoky: that worked wonders.. thanks a lot for the hint :)
[16:40:57] <Rubba> anyone here? :( it's a really basic question that's stumping me

[16:44:30] <Rubba> ooh cool
[16:45:05] <Rubba> if i was to put this in onload/ready instead of click, i'd replace 'this' with '$('#toggle') right?
[16:45:36] <NChief> yes
[16:45:52] <Rubba> i see, thanks
[16:54:29] <Kr3m> does anyone know of any good plugins for the following?  comments, likes, image upload

[17:07:05] <Mrgoose> Are there any built in things for lazy loading listviews in 1.4?

[17:44:25] <prometh> hi
[17:45:17] <prometh> can anyone think of a situation where jquery-ui-autocomplete would cause a page redirect when entering text into the connected input text field?
[17:45:44] <prometh> because that's what's happening on a project that i've been tasked to work on... and i can't figure out why it's not working as expected
[17:54:51] <prometh> :(
[17:54:58] <prometh> well, if anyone has an idea:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17959866/jquery-ui-autocomplete-causing-an-unwanted-page-redirect
[17:56:44] <dblosevn> Hey, tried the other day on this hopefully somebody here now has some experience with this. I have a jquery mobile site that on one page wraps content in an iframe that also uses jquery mobile, the iframed content works except when it opens a dialog in the iframe, in this case when you try to close the dialog it naviagtes back a page in the parent window
[17:58:29] <dblosevn> I can modify the source in both the parent window and the source of the iframed content by the way
[18:00:57] <dblosevn> heres a working test case on the example site http://lxedev.com/corephonegap/product-detail-360.html
[18:01:07] <DarkGhost`> why is this causing problems? var select = $('#join-model-bodystyle');        var options = select.attr('options'); #join-model-bodystyle is a select with nothing in it..
[18:01:10] <DarkGhost`> what is .attr('options') ?
[18:01:14] <dblosevn> just click a hotspot on the model and try to close the dialog
[18:02:38] <dblosevn> DarkGhost`: eg that would retrieve something if the element looked like <select id="join-model-bodystyle" options="something"/>
[18:03:03] <dblosevn> oh
[18:03:58] <dblosevn> select.get(0).options would retreive the items in the list or $("option", select).each(function() { })
[18:04:44] <dblosevn> options is not an attribute
[18:05:02] <dblosevn> older versions of jquery would return select.options though
[18:06:32] <dblosevn> if you upgraded jquery and thats breaking now, try .prop('options') instead as options is a property
[18:11:41] <DarkGhost`> thank you dblosevn
[18:12:10] <DarkGhost`> thank you so much dblosevn!
[18:12:10] <dblosevn> np
[18:12:15] <DarkGhost`> I couldn't find that anywhere
[18:12:31] <dblosevn> its on the documentation of jquery.attr
[18:12:37] <DarkGhost`> for some reason I'm also getting this...Error: TypeError: e is null Source File: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js
[18:13:12] <dblosevn> DarkGhost`: As of jQuery 1.6, the .attr() method returns undefined for attributes that have not been set. To retrieve and change DOM properties such as the checked, selected, or disabled state of form elements, use the .prop() method. bout halfway down
[18:13:49] <dblosevn> DarkGhost`: whats the next think down in the stack trace I almost guarenteee its not jquery that has the issue
[18:13:58] <DarkGhost`> idk how to use stack trace
[18:13:59] <DarkGhost`> :(
[18:14:13] <dblosevn> expand that error if it will let you
[18:14:28] <dblosevn> you should see the call stack
[18:14:44] <dblosevn> whats the first call that looks like your code
[18:14:44] <DarkGhost`> thats in error console
[18:14:54] <dblosevn> ya what browser you using?
[18:14:56] <DarkGhost`> firefox
[18:15:01] <DarkGhost`> if i click on it, it goes to code in jquery.js
[18:15:04] <dblosevn> oh dont think firefox is that nice
[18:15:17] <dblosevn> try it in chrome
[18:15:24] <dblosevn> you should be able to expand the error
[18:15:38] <DarkGhost`> thanks
[18:15:49] <dblosevn> been too long since I played with firebug I know theres a way to do it there too
[18:19:02] <dblosevn> what version of jquery are you using?
[18:19:22] <dblosevn> oh duh 1.10
[18:19:42] <ZGirl> Is it possible to move a file input that has a file set? That is, can I detach the input from one DOM element and attach to another element?
[18:20:05] <dblosevn> youll need to change that line of code you pasted, should be var options = select.prop('options'); as of jquery 1.6
[18:20:26] <dblosevn> zgirl: yes
[18:20:42] <ZGirl> IE won't complain?
[18:20:47] <dblosevn> shouldnt
[18:21:06] <dblosevn> your not modifying the element just moving it somewhere elese in the dom
[18:21:45] <dblosevn> $('targetselector').append($('fileselector').remove());
[18:22:27] <dblosevn> multi uploaders do something like that a lot
[18:23:04] <ZGirl> cool, thank you
[18:25:43] <dblosevn> or even cooler $('wrapperdiv').on('change', 'fileselector', function(e) { $('targetselector').append($(e.target).remove()).removeClass('fileselector');  });
[18:26:23] <dblosevn> @ ZGirl
[18:27:43] <dblosevn> that would automatically move the element when a file is selected a little modifcation and it would also create a new file element in the wrapper div
[18:31:51] <mcsquibs> how do you make a div draggable by only a section
[18:36:40] <mcsquibs> how can you make a part of a div draggable and move the whole div?
[18:45:22] <shoky> mcsquibs: http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-handle
[19:00:40] <Mrgoose> hmm loading 1600 list items is kind of slow
[19:08:19] <Quest> hi
[19:09:23] <Quest> Is it a good idea to link the jquery.min file from codes.google site or place the min in the web directories and every time the user downloads it from my site instead of google (when he views the page) ?
[19:21:00] <deimal> i would say it depends on how sensitive your site is to updates in the jquery libraries
[19:25:16] <delinquentme> ok so I search through the DOM .. find an object which I'd like to make 2 modifications to
[19:25:26] <delinquentme> specifically 2 modifications to different children ...
[19:25:44] <delinquentme> now I could select the same parent element .. but surely theres a more efficient method to do this right?
[19:30:20] <delinquentme> I'm wanting o say theres some kind of ' jump to previously matched node ' method?
[19:30:26] <delinquentme> Maybe I"m making this up :D

[21:13:26] <guspollos> is it possible to have a variable inside a jquery selector?
[21:13:30] <guspollos> like:
[21:13:32] <guspollos> i=5;
[21:13:47] <guspollos> $('item'+i).addClass('lol');
[21:19:31] <gordian> guspollos: yes
[21:19:40] <gordian> the way you've done it should work
[21:21:52] <amo> what is sizzle
[21:26:40] <kborchers> amo: it's the selector engine jQuery uses http://sizzlejs.com/
[21:30:04] <amo> thank  but I just want to know what is the selector engine , how does it work and where we have to use and why we have to use?
[21:32:21] <sammych> a selector is nothing more than a string
[21:32:31] <sammych> as long as you give it a string, it'll think it'ls a selector

[21:46:41] <mjflick> hi, how exactly can i query an absolute dom path in jquery? for example: //HTML/BODY/DIV/DIV[1]/FORM[0]/TABLE/TBODY/TR[4]/TD[3]/INPUT
[21:49:53] <ASUchander> mjflick: I think you need the child selector
[21:52:08] <ASUchander> Probably $('html > body > div >  - not exactly sure how you get the offset for the 2nd div though
[21:59:13] <mjflick> so, there's no direct way to query by xpath then? i couldn't find it any of the docs
[21:59:27] <mjflick> i guess i could break things down with multiple jquery calls, but that's sort of nasty
[21:59:43] <ASUchander> mjflick: I don't know
[22:10:58] <horrror> how come this line ( elements.fadeOut(200, function() { $(this).remove(); $(this).next('br').remove(); }); ) removes the element but not the br element
[22:19:54] <sammych> horrror: probably because this isn't there anymore
[22:19:58] <dblosevn> mjflick: $('html body div div:eq(1) form:eq(0) table tbody tr:eq(4) td:eq(3) input')
[22:20:08] <dblosevn> but thats going to be a hell of a slow selector
[22:20:08] <sammych> so next to nowhere is nothing
[22:21:57] <tw2113> holy balls batman
[22:22:19] <dblosevn> lol he asked
[22:23:05] <dblosevn> I cant think of a situation in my last 15 years of web development id ever have had to use a selector like that
