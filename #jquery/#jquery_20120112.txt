[00:01:24] <radarig> edulterado $('a:not(.active)')
[00:03:19] <radarig> or test for the class with hasClass() inside the event callback I suppose
[00:03:57] <edulterado> thank you radarig, iÂ´ll explore them
[00:04:17] <Ortund> radarig, is he not asking how to exclude the a:active styling from the link?
[00:04:25] <Ortund> oh no, there, I see... it is a class
[00:04:40] <Ortund> in which case, I prefer the a:not(.active) option
[00:05:05] <radarig> Yeah, would be better unless it had to be dynamic or something.
[00:09:26] <theBrettman> why doesn't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/LKqVs/
[00:12:13] <Ortund> theBrettman: I don't think jsfiddle can parse html5 yet :(
[00:12:20] <Ortund> I see no html there whatsoever
[00:17:25] <_rooster_> exit
[00:19:08] <theBrettman> you can make pages without html
[00:19:25] <theBrettman> that's what I was doing. making them with jquery
[00:19:56] <theBrettman> u can do it with javascript. I'm just not sure exactly how I do it with jquery yet
[00:20:21] <radarig> Maybe this is closer to what you're trying to achieve: http://jsfiddle.net/LKqVs/1/
[00:20:53] <rzeka> I've got div with image only. When I try to get width or outerWidth, it returns "0" while the image ix 218x218. Any way to fix that? Here's the code: http://pastebin.com/kfSsY0WG
[00:21:43] <ph88> how do i warp this piece of code in a function ? http://pastebin.com/ufLSTV83
[00:22:19] <jomofcw> rzeka, img isn't positionning as absolute or something else ?
[00:22:37] <rzeka> nope. There is full code
[00:22:41] <radarig> rzeka: possibly because you're using display:inline
[00:22:53] <jomofcw> rzeka the image has the attribute height and width ? If no you have to get the width when the image is ready
[00:23:01] <rzeka> radarig, I've tried without it. Still returns "0"
[00:24:06] <rzeka> jomofcw, hm. So, even if the image makes div bigger, I have to detect its width by image? :P strange, but thanks
[00:24:41] <jomofcw> rzeka it make it "bigger" only after it is ready.
[00:25:03] <jomofcw> Before loading the image, the browser dunno that the parent div will be bigger because of the image dimension.
[00:25:17] <cerberos> anyone know how I can bind to a prototype custom event in jquery? .bind() doesn't work
[00:25:17] <jomofcw> Except if you give it height and width attribute
[00:25:24] <jomofcw> which is clearly recommended as possible
[00:26:17] <jomofcw> cerberos... you speak about prototype JS ? The JS library ?
[00:26:38] <cerberos> jomofcw: yes, I should have said Prototype
[00:26:50] <cerberos> JS
[00:26:53] <jomofcw> cerberos you should not do that.
[00:27:04] <cerberos> jomofcw: why not?
[00:27:04] <jomofcw> jQuery and Prototype do the same, on a diferent way.
[00:27:14] <jomofcw> Why do you need that ?
[00:27:24] <jomofcw> Why not use only jQuery ?
[00:27:57] <cerberos> because some code that I have to incorporate already uses Prototype
[00:28:31] <jomofcw> cerberos that's where it's weird :/.
[00:28:37] <cerberos> yes, rewriting  it all is out of scope
[00:28:44] <jomofcw> cerberos which event would you bind ?
[00:28:58] <jomofcw> What do you want to do ?
[00:29:32] <cerberos> jomofcw: I want to bind to a Prototype custom event in jquery. :)
[00:30:04] <theBrettman> thx radarig
[00:31:54] <radarig> theBrettman: np :)
[00:32:00] <theBrettman> can I appendTo objects?
[00:33:46] <jomofcw> cerberos the only thing I'm sure that you can't use bind directly. You should do something like .bind('click',function(){/*calling prototype event here*/})
[00:34:32] <theBrettman> why wouldn't he use .on('click', function {})?
[00:35:04] <cerberos> jomofcw: I don't want to fire the prototype event, I want to bind a callback to it with jquery
[00:35:36] <cerberos> theBrettman: the project uses jquery 1.7, don't think it has .on()
[00:35:58] <theBrettman> oh
[00:36:31] <rzeka> jomofcw, radarig: got it. It's webkit thing. It got DOM ready before the images are loaded :) I just had to change documenr.ready() to windows.load() :)
[00:36:37] <rzeka> Now it works fine :> Thanks for help
[00:39:25] <mindis|work> what's the best way to replace a selected text in a contenteditable object or textarea?
[00:39:32] <cerberos> 1.6 I should say, which doesn't have .on()
[00:39:39] <jomofcw> rzeka ;). Try to use $(function(){}) instead. I'm not sure but I think it's crossbrowser.
[00:41:22] <Cork> jomofcw: it is, but its the same as domready
[00:41:35] <Cork> jomofcw: and domready is triggered before all external media is loaded
[00:41:39] <jomofcw> Cork OK thanks.
[00:41:47] <Cork> so images, audio, video and so on isn't loaded when domready triggers
[00:41:58] <Cork> so if you want to wait for that onload is exactly what you want
[00:43:03] <rzeka> One more thing. How can I force .each to skip the last element? :)
[00:43:47] <Cork> rzeka: .not(':last').each()
[00:43:54] <rzeka> :>
[00:44:03] <rzeka> Or by slice right? ; )
[00:44:44] <Cork> ya
[00:44:51] <Cork> but slize is a bit more combersome
[00:44:53] <naeluh> Cork: got it lookin good http://onela-iaf.org/onela_new/news thanks agan
[00:45:49] <Cork> naeluh: np
[00:46:07] <nocturnal> http://www.visitorjs.com/details/api/variables is there something like this in a jquery plugin?
[00:47:06] <Cork> nocturnal: i don't really see why it would need to be a jquery plugin
[00:47:13] <Cork> its not dom related at all
[00:47:17] <JKarsrud> nocturnal: why do you need it as a plugin?
[00:47:26] <JKarsrud> what Cork said
[00:48:30] <nocturnal> I don't, I just assumed it woule be a plugin. so you're saying all this can be done in jquery without a plugin, or all this can be done in javascript without the need for jquery?
[00:48:50] <JKarsrud> it's an api for something not-DOM-related, which means it doesn't make sense to put it in a plugin
[00:48:56] <Cork> nocturnal: you need an external lib
[00:48:57] <JKarsrud> nocturnal: jquery IS javascript
[00:49:19] <JKarsrud> so you'd just need visitor.js; http://www.visitorjs.com/details/api/setup
[00:50:14] <JKarsrud> and you'd be set to go. jQuery just makes it easier in some ways to present the info back to the user, but you don't need jquery for this
[00:50:23] <nocturnal> yeah but I was hoping for a way to do it without being tied into their api keys and pricing.
[00:50:30] <nocturnal> a completely free api for it
[00:51:53] <_ramo> hi
[00:53:57] <radarig> nocturnal: what do you want to use visitorjs to get?
[00:58:27] <JKarsrud> nocturnal: ah, right. I missed the whole pricing part. What visitor.js is, is just a wrapper that wraps a lot of other API's for you, and that can be done just as easy yourself
[00:59:00] <Cork> nocturnal: if you just want goip, theres a free lib for php
[00:59:12] <Cork> just echo the values into a js variable and you should be set
[01:00:18] <Cork> i wouldn't want to use geoip purly in js anyway, that database is quite large
[01:07:49] <sasori> question: let's say I have <input id="proditem"  name="'.$id.'" type="text"  value="'.$qty.'"> , what's the correct selector to get the name ?
[01:08:28] <CatBoy119> Hello.
[01:09:17] <CatBoy119> Does a way exist to turn a string containing []s and commas into something that works in a parameter besides having to use eval?
[01:10:08] <DukeDrake> CatBoy119: escape(), maybe?
[01:10:34] <CatBoy119> :o I'll try it.
[01:11:08] <theBrettman> data() can hold arrays, right?
[01:11:16] <DukeDrake> anyone got an idea to improve this selecter? i.e. make it work? $(".dataelems[data.somekey *= 'foo'] ")
[01:11:24] <DukeDrake> theBrettman: yes
[01:11:54] <Cork> theBrettman: $().data is just a wrapper around an array
[01:12:00] <Cork> theBrettman: it can store most anything
[01:12:09] <theBrettman> perfect
[01:12:17] <Cork> <elm data-foo=""> is another matter
[01:12:47] <Cork> DukeDrake: whats data.somekey ?
[01:13:39] <DukeDrake> ('#myelem1').data ("somekey", "foo");  ('#myelem2').data ("somekey", "bar");
[01:13:53] <is_null> hi all, how to trigger an event after e.preventDefault() ?
[01:14:25] <CatBoy119> Duke, didn't work.. :(
[01:14:29] <Cork> DukeDrake: $(".dataelems').filter(function() { return $(this).data('somekey') !== undefined; })
[01:15:02] <Cork> is_null: depends on the element, some events you can't trigger
[01:15:20] <Cork> is_null: but you can ex. do this.submit()
[01:15:31] <is_null> ok, thanks Cork
[01:15:33] <Cork> (this is the dom object in this case, not a jquery object)
[01:16:08] <DukeDrake> CatBoy119: I'd need more details ...
[01:16:18] <DukeDrake> Cork: thanx
[01:16:25] <Cork> np
[01:16:30] <CatBoy119> my problem is pretty much a string going ['hello',0],['bye',1],['yeah',20] and all these brackets and commas got turned into strings.
[01:16:44] <CatBoy119> If I use a variable holding all these (as a string) and attempt to use the variable, it fails.
[01:16:58] <CatBoy119> If I instead copy paste all that out and into where it should go, it works.
[01:17:09] <Cork> CatBoy119: if you can get ' to be " its simple to handle
[01:17:16] <CatBoy119> Sure I can
[01:17:21] <Cork> else your in for some regex
[01:17:23] <CatBoy119> ' vs " not an issue for me.
[01:17:23] <sasori> is this correct ? $('input#proditem').attr('name').val();
[01:17:30] <CatBoy119> I can change that :)
[01:17:41] <Cork> ?eval '["hello",0],["bye",1],["yeah",20]'
[01:17:43] <bot-t1> Cork: "[\"hello\",0],[\"bye\",1],[\"yeah\",20]"
[01:17:51] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('["hello",0],["bye",1],["yeah",20]')
[01:17:52] <bot-t1> Cork: SyntaxError: JSON.parse
[01:17:57] <DukeDrake> heh =)
[01:18:10] <Cork> -_-'
[01:18:14] <CatBoy119> ;_;
[01:18:18] <sasori> anyone?
[01:19:00] <CatBoy119> I'd be for just pasting in the contents and leave it be working, but I can't since said contents change based on data. :/
[01:19:33] <CatBoy119> So at the least I need those [ , ]s and separating commas to work >.< It works in php but not in javascript.
[01:20:46] <Cork> CatBoy119: this should work in a browser JSON.parse('[["hello",0],["bye",1],["yeah",20]]')
[01:20:52] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('[["hello",0],["bye",1],["yeah",20]]')
[01:20:53] <bot-t1> Cork: [["hello", 0], ["bye", 1], ["yeah", 20]]
[01:21:07] * Cork wacks bot-t1
[01:21:48] <Cork> and for the record
[01:21:54] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('[["hello",0],["bye",1],["yeah",20]]')[0][1]
[01:21:55] <bot-t1> Cork: 0
[01:22:01] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('[["hello",0],["bye",1],["yeah",20]]')[2][0]
[01:22:02] <bot-t1> Cork: "yeah"
[01:22:22] <CatBoy119> Okay :) I'll try these
[01:22:27] <CatBoy119> tyvm
[01:22:33] <Cork> np
[01:23:05] <DukeDrake> hmmm ... if I assign all my data to attributes instead of .data() they get so easy to search o.o
[01:23:38] <mehrdad_> what the heck with the Date.getDate func?!?!
[01:23:50] <Cork> ?
[01:23:53] <DukeDrake> like $('#myelem1').attr("somekey","foo");  instead of like $('#myelem1').data("somekey","foo");
[01:23:59] <mehrdad_> i thought it returns the date
[01:24:13] <DukeDrake> mehrdad_: 0 = January, 1 = February etc ...
[01:24:16] <mehrdad_> why is it called getDate if it returns a day
[01:24:20] <MrBenn> Don't be silly, that'd make the Date object too awesome
[01:24:29] <mehrdad_> lol?
[01:25:01] <mehrdad_> who the hell named it like that?
[01:25:14] <Cork> DukeDrake: at least use data-foo when you add them with attr
[01:25:23] <mehrdad_> a kid would name funcs better i swear
[01:25:34] <Cork> DukeDrake: you should NEVER add none standard attributes that doesn't start with data-
[01:28:07] <Iszak> or unless it fixes IE
[01:28:29] <kaeferli> hey guys..i got a problem: i've got a couple of <a> tags with class item_link .. now i do some jquery stuff: alert ($('.item_link').html() ... and i get only the HTML of the first a-tag ....as a understand,  jquery processes ALL a tags with class item_link --- so wheres the problem?
[01:28:30] <Cork> Iszak: what none standard attribute fixes ie?
[01:28:39] <Iszak> e.g. for iframes
[01:29:07] <Cork> ah
[01:29:22] <Iszak> damn IE, hate hate hate.
[01:29:31] <Cork> who doesn't
[01:29:48] <Iszak> People who work at MS, they probably hate it too.
[01:30:02] <mindis|work> kaeferli you'll need to loop through them and gather the html from all of them if you want to show them all in a single alert()
[01:30:48] <kaeferli> mindis|work: ok - how to do that properly? (i dont really want to do an alert, but store every html in an array)
[01:31:31] <Cork> kaeferli: $('<div/>').html($('.item_link').clone()).html()
[01:31:45] <SPYGAME> hey all, i'm using .clone() method to clone my form fields but somehow IE does not add file fields and drops it, any suggestions?\
[01:32:21] <mindis|work> kaeferli i'd do something like $('.item_link').each( function() { // do whatever you like regarding each item_link });
[01:32:32] <Cork> ugg...
[01:32:35] <Cork> why each
[01:32:37] <Cork> at least use map
[01:32:42] <mindis|work> why not :)
[01:32:57] <Cork> cause then you have to store it in a variable and it becomes long
[01:33:27] <kaeferli> var would be ok
[01:33:32] <Cork> $.map($('.item_link'), function(elm) { return $(elm).html() });
[01:33:36] <DukeDrake> Cork: ok, thanx. But .... you understand: it's really easy selecting an element this way? Instead of searchin .data() first ?
[01:34:15] <Cork> DukeDrake: ya, but selecting on arguments is ... nasty
[01:34:20] <Cork> *attributes
[01:35:02] <DukeDrake> Cork: in what way is it nasty?
[01:35:31] <ph88_> what does $(this) mean ?
[01:35:32] <Cork> DukeDrake: cause to do attribute selection you have to select all elements, then loop over them fetch the attribute list
[01:35:36] <Cork> and check them one by one
[01:35:49] <Cork> ph88_: wrap the current element in a jquery object
[01:36:00] <Cork> ph88_: mostly used in loops and events
[01:36:10] <SPYGAME> anyone ?
[01:36:41] <Cork> SPYGAME: theres tons of rules around input fields
[01:37:01] <Cork> its prob better to create a new one instead of cloning it
[01:37:02] <ph88_> how to trigger a form submit ?
[01:37:08] <DukeDrake> Cork: mh .... how about ["myattr"*="foo"]  ?
[01:37:18] <Cork> DukeDrake: doesn't matter
[01:37:37] <Cork> attributes is a child to the element, so it has to be looped in the dom
[01:37:45] <SPYGAME> Cork: hey i'm doing jQuery("#my_form").find(":input").clone().prependTo($uploadForm)
[01:37:49] <DukeDrake> Cork: aside that ... to do searching, you always have to cheack each element one-by-one, no?
[01:37:58] <Cork> DukeDrake: classes and especially id's are indexed and much much faster
[01:38:33] <Cork> DukeDrake: my point was actually that its better to use class or id to find the element
[01:39:06] <DukeDrake> Cork: ah ... hm... so spawning elements with ids as needle would be faster , hm?
[01:39:31] <Cork> SPYGAME: ya, and my point is, its prob better to do append('<input type="file">') to the uploadForm
[01:39:32] <DukeDrake> e.g. <div id="foo" class="key"> </div>
[01:39:51] <Cork> DukeDrake: depends how ofter you do this selection
[01:40:13] <Cork> DukeDrake: if you for example to a live like hover event, it would be quite nasty
[01:40:33] <Cork> if you select it in validating a form... why not!
[01:40:50] <Cork> so how often its used depends a lot on if it matters
[01:40:52] <DukeDrake> it's meant to filter data from a large table
[01:41:07] <Cork> that might be slow
[01:41:19] <Cork> if the table is really long
[01:41:28] <Cork> though long tables are slow by default
[01:41:37] <DukeDrake> "what" might be slow?
[01:41:45] <Cork> selecting it
[01:41:53] <DukeDrake> spawning the elements or selecting? =)
[01:42:04] <Cork> if you have many elements you need to filter agenst it takes time to filter on attributes
[01:42:18] <DukeDrake> yeah ... you have to filter anyway ...
[01:42:32] <Cork> well filtering on ex a class is much faster
[01:42:36] <DukeDrake> I'll elaborate a little and head back later ^^
[01:42:41] <Cork> and id is much much faster
[01:42:52] <DukeDrake> ok
[01:43:04] <Cork> id is close to the speed of you keeping a fer to the dom element
[01:43:10] <Cork> fer==ref
[01:43:33] <shomon> hi, I'm trying to figure out how to get ext.msgbox.show to give a messagebox that then redirects to a set page when clicked
[01:43:37] <DukeDrake> ok
[01:43:40] <shomon> as in "it didn't work start again"
[01:43:48] <shomon> how do I do this redirect bit?
[01:44:01] <Cork> DukeDrake: but the best tip is prob to test and see
[01:44:04] <shomon> or where is a good place to ask if it is not here, sorry
[01:44:16] <Cork> DukeDrake: don't make the code overly complicated before it has to
[01:44:35] <Cork> DukeDrake: make some tests and see if it needs to be faster
[01:46:47] <shwaiil> hi
[01:47:17] <Cork> shomon: ext.msgbox.show, what framework is that?
[01:47:51] <shomon> ah it must not be jquery... sorry!
[01:48:03] <Cork> i suspect its extjs
[01:48:06] <shomon> oh well. .I typed it in to google and found a pastebin that has a nice example...
[01:48:10] <shwaiil> Q: Whats wrong here ? I get 02 instead of just 2. offset : (parseInt($('.thumb-list.active li').css('margin-left')) != undefined ? parseInt($('.thumb-list.active li').css('margin-left')) : 0 ) + (parseInt($('.thumb-list.active li').css('margin-right')) != undefined ? parseInt($('.thumb-list.active li').css('margin-right')) : 0)
[01:48:26] <shomon> I'll see if they have an irc...
[01:48:27] <shomon> thanks
[01:49:12] <shwaiil> if I do width : parseInt($('.thumb-list.active li').css('width')) + parseInt(this.offset != undefined ? parseInt(this.offset) : 0), I get only the first operator value, this.offset is undefined
[01:49:27] <Cork> ?p @ shwaiil
[01:49:27] <bot-t1> shwaiil, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:49:36] <shwaiil> Cork: thanks for looking
[01:49:37] <shwaiil> just a sec
[01:49:39] <Cork> and include html so the selector works
[01:50:40] <Anomie21> (first time using jquery): getting the following error on my site [Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined] however I'm defining it in my <head> using [<script src="jquery.min.js"></script>] am I missing something?
[01:52:17] <Cork> Anomie21: why do you have [] around it?
[01:53:45] <Famic> hi
[01:55:00] <Anomie21> Cork: I don't I just stuck that in here to separate the code from the rest of my sentence. heh
[01:55:30] <Famic> I'm using $(#my-select).bind('change', function(){ alert($(this).val()); }); It seems to work fine in most browsers but not in IE. Any clue about that ?
[01:55:35] <Anomie21> It's a twitter feed I'm trying to load here [http://cravenpublishing.com/] Under 'Publishing Accolates' ->  Here's my code: http://pastebin.com/9dibwhGQ
[01:56:28] <Famic> by not working I mean the value is null in that case
[01:56:59] <Cork> Anomie21: is the script tag before where you try to use it?
[01:57:23] <Anomie21> Cork: Yes I've defined them in the <head>
[01:57:48] <Famic> bleh, nevermind, I found the culprit
[01:58:03] <Cork> Anomie21: and in the correct order <jquery> <your script>
[01:58:09] <Cork> the order is important
[01:58:29] <Cork> if yes, check so you don't have any parsing errors
[01:58:32] <Anomie21> Cork: Yep
[01:59:08] <Anomie21> Cork: There's no parsing errors in the code, it's the jquery twitter example from jsfiddle
[01:59:39] <Cork> Anomie21: then i need to see the code to be able to answer
[01:59:53] <Anomie21> http://cravenpublishing.com/
[02:00:36] <Cork> <script src="jquery.tweets.0.1.js"></script>
[02:00:36] <Cork> <script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
[02:00:38] <Cork> wrong order
[02:01:11] <Anomie21> Cork: Much be a cache, I changed that a few min ago and its still not working
[02:01:52] <Cork> yup
[02:01:56] <Cork> and now theres no errors
[02:02:15] <Anomie21> Hmm
[02:02:19] <Anomie21> true
[02:02:23] <Anomie21> but still not working :(
[02:02:34] <mindis|work> uhhhh. i don't suppose anyone knows a replacement for the fieldSelection plugin
[02:04:03] <Joeytje50> hey, does anyone know if it is possible to compare two getJSON results with each other?
[02:04:43] <Cork> Joeytje50: you prob want to use .get instead
[02:04:48] <Cork> then compare the strings
[02:04:54] <Cork> then you can use JSON.parse
[02:05:43] <mindis|work> crap
[02:05:59] <Joeytje50> ah I'll try doing that, thanks Cork
[02:06:00] <nexus49> can anyone explain me why the element I append are under the div? or dissapear? http://jsfiddle.net/KzcuC/3/
[02:06:10] <kaeferli> 	for (i=0; i<item_link_array.length; i++) {
[02:06:10] <kaeferli> 		item_id_array = [];
[02:06:10] <kaeferli> 		item_id = new String(item_link_array[i]).match(/\d+/);
[02:06:10] <kaeferli> 		item_id_array.push(item_id);
[02:06:11] <kaeferli> 	}
[02:06:11] <kaeferli> why contains the item_id_array only the last entry and not the full array?
[02:06:19] <kaeferli> ops, sorry :/
[02:07:15] <nexus49> because you need to declare the array outside the loop
[02:07:41] <kaeferli> thx ;)
[02:07:46] <nexus49> i guess :)
[02:07:53] <kaeferli> now it works -.
[02:08:37] <nexus49> kaeferli maybe you can help me with my problem ? =)
[02:11:55] <CatBoy119> Sorry, not able to get my head around this just yet. I just noticed there's this array.. anArray = [[]]
[02:12:06] <CatBoy119> What's with the extra backets, the significance?
[02:12:15] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/WtwXB/8/
[02:12:22] <rethus> why this email-validation not work
[02:12:38] <shesek> CatBoy119, the first element in the array is an array with no elements
[02:12:39] <rethus> strange, only some value is need in email-field... not checking for @
[02:12:40] <Cork> CatBoy119: two timentional array
[02:12:51] <CatBoy119> o.O
[02:12:53] <Cork> *dimentional
[02:13:23] <Cork> ?eval ([[1,2,3][4,5,6]])[1]1]
[02:13:23] <bot-t1> Cork: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[02:13:31] <Cork> ?eval ([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])[1]1]
[02:13:32] <bot-t1> Cork: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[02:13:40] <Cork> lol
[02:13:42] <Cork> ?eval ([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])[1][1]
[02:13:42] <bot-t1> Cork: 5
[02:14:11] <seutje> that's... deep
[02:14:16] <rethus> ok, got it
[02:14:37] <CatBoy119> omg now I understand more. ty Cork, what you were showing with the json parse was how to access a two-dimensional array's contents.
[02:14:53] <Cork> yes
[02:15:14] <Cork> two dimentional array in a string to be precise
[02:15:21] <CatBoy119> :( Yeah
[02:16:05] <Anomie21> Cork: Fixed! Had to use  $(document).ready(function () { /* code */ });
[02:23:10] <gorillatron> yo i have a problem
[02:23:13] <gorillatron> nvm :P
[02:37:02] <EdwardIII> hey
[02:37:32] <EdwardIII> i've done a jquery mobile themeroller, included the stylesheet above the jquery mobile standard stylesheet, put data-theme='a' on my button, but it just turns gray, not green like i specified in themeroller?
[02:42:00] <nexus49> can anyone explain me why i get a token error with (this)? http://jsfiddle.net/rcVXE/
[02:43:24] <nexus49> i think there is some problem how i pass the parameters
[02:43:34] <nexus49> to the drop() function
[02:43:37] <iaj> Hey there.. could you guys gimme an advice on how would be a good approach to have a validation, for some input ('#foo1,..,#foo10) to be filled in, after submitting a form?
[02:43:52] <iaj> And I guess a javascript alert would be the best solution?
[02:44:06] <nexus49> javascript alerts are so 80's :))
[02:45:58] <mindis|work> they're also the safest solution so they're good for testing
[02:46:24] <iaj> Hmmm... nexus49 whats the modern approach?
[02:46:32] <KiiK> hi, anybody use JQM ? why JS code doesn't work ? http://jsfiddle.net/HycXw/
[02:47:09] <nexus49> i dont know if you want a interface design tip or a programming tip
[02:47:42] <nexus49> why not just reload the form with ajax and add all the "alerts" with a nice css styling?
[02:48:25] <Bit2> iaj: jquery-ui can be a good option
[02:52:20] <atan> Is there a way to animate the backgroundPosition-Y or similar? Say I can't provide X and I just want it to use current
[02:55:24] <AdvoWork> Is there an easy way to format a date from yyyy-mm-dd to dd-mm-yyyy ?
[03:07:29] <ssj> hello anyone here?
[03:08:03] <mindis|work> no
[03:08:15] <Zogot> maybe
[03:08:33] <ssj> :/
[03:08:43] <ssj> i m trying to do a ajax call
[03:08:57] <ssj> but wen i put data : 'anything',
[03:09:01] <ssj> it doesnt work :/
[03:09:09] <nexus49> can anyone explain me why i get a token error with (this)? http://jsfiddle.net/rcVXE/
[03:09:36] <ssj> http://pastebin.com/whf5hfxN
[03:10:56] <ssj> Zogot?
[03:11:11] <AdvoWork> hi. If i have: <a href="#" id="change_date_expected" vendor_item_id="74" date_expected_modified="2012-01-13" date_picker_id="date_expected_picker_74">13-01-2012<img src="calendar.gif"></a>  how can i replace that? I've got the number74, so for the element with 74 im trying to change the 13-01-2012 and the date_expected_modified, Is that even possible?
[03:11:17] <Zogot> trying to take a look, but jsfiddle isn't responding
[03:11:18] <Zogot> 1 moment
[03:11:35] <ssj> thats pastebin :P
[03:12:39] <Zogot> oh, wrong link
[03:12:40] <Zogot> :p
[03:12:43] <ssj> :/
[03:13:03] <ssj> if i remove data: 'place=all',
[03:13:06] <ssj> it works
[03:13:16] <ssj> but if i put that it gives empty response
[03:13:16] <Zogot> try json instead
[03:13:25] <ssj> ?
[03:13:25] <Zogot> data {place: all}
[03:13:27] <MrGando> Hey guys, what's the URL of the website that allows me to put HTML + JS + CSS to make a proof of concept of a problem I'm having ? :)
[03:13:31] <Zogot> data: {place:all}
[03:13:43] <ssj> ilet me try that
[03:14:01] <Zogot> ?jsfiddle MrGando
[03:14:12] <bot-t> Zogot, Couldn't find "jsfiddle MrGando" in jQuery Docs.
[03:14:17] <Zogot> http://jsfiddle.net
[03:14:29] <MrGando> Zogot: Thanks!
[03:14:59] <iaj> nexus49: why not - just - that sounds rather difficult :)
[03:15:38] <nexus49> its pretty simple. take a look at load() and submit()
[03:16:38] <ssj> u wnat to chnge the value of date_expected_modified?
[03:16:49] <ssj> where vendor thing is 74?
[03:17:12] <AdvoWork> ssj,  like:  $('#change_date_expected" with vendor_item_id=74).attr("date_expected_modified") = "2012-01-16"   so ive got the number 74, i want to change the date_expected_modifier(so overwrite it)
[03:17:51] <ssj> umm AdvoWork its nexus who needs it not me :P
[03:18:31] <AdvoWork> ssj, u asked if i wanted to change the value, so im explaining?
[03:18:56] <ssj> ok i mcponfused -__-
[03:18:57] <ssj> damn
[03:19:01] <AdvoWork> lol
[03:19:15] <Zogot> nexus: http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/ATyKN/3/
[03:19:28] <ssj> Zogot that fked up the jquery :/
[03:19:33] <ssj> changing to json
[03:19:39] <Zogot> o?
[03:19:45] <ssj> yea
[03:19:48] <ssj> didnt even run now
[03:20:15] <nexus49> jsfiddle is slow today...
[03:20:18] <Zogot> aye
[03:20:19] <Zogot> lol
[03:21:28] <nexus49> Zogot, what did you change?
[03:21:38] <nexus49> i cant find the modification ^^
[03:21:52] <Zogot> the top function had ui.draggable
[03:22:01] <Zogot> you were passing that from the drop function
[03:22:06] <Zogot> anything would of done it
[03:22:31] <ssj> umm?
[03:22:35] <ssj> mine is still fked /
[03:22:42] <Zogot> got an example of what you have written now ssj>?#
[03:23:43] <ssj> http://pastebin.com/whf5hfxN
[03:23:45] <ssj> here is the jquery
[03:23:58] <ssj> and in process.php i have <?php
[03:23:59] <ssj> echo 'yes';
[03:23:59] <ssj> ?>
[03:23:59] <bot-t> ...
[03:24:05] <ssj> bot-t?
[03:24:18] <ssj> example?
[03:24:31] <Zogot> he was just responding to the ?
[03:24:39] <ssj> ohk
[03:24:41] <ssj> lol
[03:24:57] <nexus49> and whats the problem with your code ssj?
[03:25:04] <ssj> empty response
[03:25:17] <ssj> success:function(data) {
[03:25:17] <ssj>             alert(data);
[03:25:17] <ssj>         }
[03:25:20] <ssj> the data is empty
[03:25:54] <nexus49> maybe you should write a logfile via the php file. so you know what happens and if the request even get fired
[03:25:57] <ssj> same thing works in ff and chrome
[03:26:12] <ssj> fks up in IE
[03:26:16] <nexus49> ohh
[03:26:24] <nexus49> so its IE related problem?
[03:26:28] <ssj> yup
[03:26:29] <ssj> :/
[03:26:32] <ssj> hate IE
[03:26:43] <ssj> one thing
[03:26:51] <nexus49> if you send me the link i can test it with IE7
[03:26:57] <ssj> if i remove the data : 'place=all',
[03:27:00] <ssj> it works
[03:27:33] <ssj> umm its a software nexus
[03:27:47] <nexus49> maybe try a more simple ajax request
[03:28:00] <ssj> works
[03:28:14] <ssj> $.ajax
[03:28:14] <ssj>      ({
[03:28:14] <ssj> 	    type :'GET',
[03:28:14] <ssj> 		url: 'process.php',
[03:28:14] <ssj> 		//data: 'place=all',
[03:28:14] <ssj>         error:function(xhr, status, errorThrown) {
[03:28:15] <ssj>             alert(errorThrown+'\n'+status+'\n'+xhr.statusText);
[03:28:15] <ssj>         },
[03:28:16] <ssj>         success:function(ret) {
[03:28:16] <ssj>             alert(ret);
[03:28:17] <ssj>         }
[03:28:17] <ssj>     });
[03:28:18] <ssj> that code works
[03:28:28] <ssj>  $.ajax
[03:28:29] <ssj>      ({
[03:28:29] <ssj> 	    type :'GET',
[03:28:29] <ssj> 		url: 'process.php',
[03:28:29] <ssj> 		data: 'place=all',
[03:28:29] <ssj>         error:function(xhr, status, errorThrown) {
[03:28:29] <ssj>             alert(errorThrown+'\n'+status+'\n'+xhr.statusText);
[03:28:29] <ssj>         },
[03:28:30] <ssj>         success:function(ret) {
[03:28:30] <ssj>             alert(ret);
[03:28:31] <ssj>         }
[03:28:31] <ssj>     });
[03:28:32] <ssj> this doesnt :/
[03:29:38] <AdvoWork> ssj, this is what i was trying to do http://jsfiddle.net/XwSWv/1/  so the show current date works, it shows me what its currently set to, but i want to be able to set my own date
[03:32:14] <nexus49> ssj try this code
[03:32:15] <nexus49> http://chopapp.com/#xwtdzi5g
[03:32:27] <nexus49> maybe it helps :|
[03:32:49] <atan> I have $(this).stop().animate({backgroundPosition: "-338px -100px"}, 'slow'); but I also want to change font color... how would I do this?
[03:34:11] <nexus49> atan, .css('data', 'value');
[03:34:35] <atan> Will add and try, thanks!
[03:35:06] <ssj> um AdvoWork
[03:35:13] <atan> $(this).stop().css('color', '#ffffff').animate({backgroundPosition: "-338px -100px"}, 'slow'); doesn't change to white for me oddly
[03:35:22] <ssj> the 2nd line
[03:35:37] <ssj> $('#change_date_expected').date_expected_modified('date_expected_modified','2012-01-16');Â Â 
[03:35:44] <ssj> it shud be
[03:35:45] <ssj> $('#change_date_expected').attr('date_expected_modified','2012-01-16');Â Â 
[03:35:45] <atan> Ahh, actually I think I need to seleect the innter a :D thanks
[03:36:00] <ssj> just tried that and it works
[03:36:26] <nexus49> atan, .animate({backgroundPosition: "-338px -100px", background-color: "xxxx" }
[03:36:34] <MrGando> Hey guys, I'm trying to inject a div in my websiteâ€¦ the problem is that when I do it, another div gets weirdâ€¦ here's what I'm seeing http://imgur.com/CsRih , and here's a proof of concept http://jsfiddle.net/XYcGz/  (Just press the "Learn More" button that will execute the javascript at the end of the HTML )
[03:36:44] <nexus49> atan, http://api.jquery.com/animate/ check out the example at the bottom
[03:36:59] <atan> nexus49, say I am using this on a li how would I add on that I want to select the inner anchor? :-)
[03:37:14] <AdvoWork> If ive got <a href="#" id="change_date_expected" vendor_item_id="74"  This works, $('#change_date_expected').attr('date_expected_modified', '2012-01-16');   but if ive got multiple elements of change_date_expected how can i say where the vendor_item_id is 74? ie $('#change_date_expected' WHERE vendor_item_id = 74).attr ?
[03:37:30] <atan> nexus49, thank you for being so helpful by the way :-)
[03:37:40] <Epeli> Where jQuery.offset.initialize() has gone from jQuery 1.7? I cannot find any mentions from the change log
[03:37:49] <nexus49> sorry i cant help you with your last questions. just another jquery noob here :D
[03:38:06] <nexus49> but check out the selector documention
[03:38:10] <nexus49> it will help you for sure
[03:38:37] <atan> :) thanks
[03:40:03] <nexus49> atan, maybe this helps http://api.jquery.com/first-child-selector/
[03:40:04] <ssj> nexus49
[03:40:05] <JKarsrud> AdvoWork: well, for one thing, you should be using data-attributes
[03:40:13] <nexus49> ssj, yeah?
[03:40:28] <JKarsrud> so that it says; <a href="#" data-vendor_item_id="74">
[03:40:35] <ssj> it doesnt work wen i add the data : 'blahb;ah',
[03:40:41] <ssj> else it works
[03:40:55] <nexus49> why you use data: ? if you send the data via GET
[03:41:02] <nexus49> just add it to the url parameters
[03:41:10] <JKarsrud> and AdvoWork, only _one_ element can have an ID, so in your case, it would be best to add classes
[03:41:15] <ssj> :o
[03:41:20] <ssj> let me try that :p
[03:41:24] <nexus49> hehe
[03:41:28] <nexus49> you think to complicated
[03:41:34] <JKarsrud> then you could use id as the vendor_item_id, thus removing it entirely
[03:42:23] <JKarsrud> you'd probably have to prefix it tho, as id and name must begin with [A-Za-z]
[03:42:34] <JKarsrud> D and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods (".").
[03:42:40] <JKarsrud> oops; ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods (".").
[03:42:41] <ssj> but nexus49 i might have to switch to post sumtime later :P
[03:42:43] <ssj> wat then?
[03:42:56] <ssj> JKarsrud
[03:42:56] <nexus49> did you try it with post already?
[03:43:05] <ssj> his example on jsfiddle works
[03:43:12] <ssj> he just did a mistake in 2nd line
[03:43:13] <ssj> nuthing else
[03:43:23] <JKarsrud> ssj: whut?
[03:43:24] <ssj> umm yea nexus49 :P
[03:43:44] <ssj> http://jsfiddle.net/XwSWv/1/
[03:43:47] <ssj> that JKarsrud
[03:43:51] <ssj> AdvoWork posted
[03:43:51] <atan> nexus49, you nailed it. Thank you :-) that will work perfectly
[03:43:59] <nexus49> np
[03:44:32] <JKarsrud> ssj, well, that still doesn't mean that the code is good
[03:44:42] <JKarsrud> I'm just trying to improve his code
[03:45:04] <ssj> i wonder if AdvoWork is here
[03:45:28] <ssj> that also  didnt work nexus49:/
[03:45:31] <ssj> still empty
[03:45:45] <nexus49> hehe
[03:46:02] <ssj> i have been trying this shit for ages -__-
[03:46:06] <ssj> still trying
[03:46:15] <ssj> before i got sum shity error
[03:46:23] <ssj> that fixed
[03:46:26] <ssj> and now this
[03:49:54] <JKarsrud> ssj, what are you struggling with? :)
[03:50:04] <JKarsrud> I need a break from this plugin I'm writing :P
[03:50:32] <ssj> :o
[03:50:44] <ssj> i m strugglinh with the ajax call
[03:50:50] <ssj> i have been trying to do for weeks now
[03:51:01] <JKarsrud> Do you have code on a pastebin?
[03:51:23] <ssj> $.ajax({
[03:51:23] <ssj>       url: 'process.php',
[03:51:23] <ssj>       success: function (data) {
[03:51:23] <ssj>          alert(data);
[03:51:23] <ssj>       }
[03:51:24] <ssj>    });	
[03:51:26] <ssj> :v
[03:51:36] <ssj> small :v
[03:52:30] <ssj> Pastebin.com is under heavy load right now :'(
[03:52:32] <ssj> damn :o
[03:52:52] <ssj> that kitty always makes me laugh :v
[03:53:05] <redfox> lets say i have content which i get via $.ajax and this content has javascript itself included (i.e. a ajax link). how do i get this code to work after $.ajax request?
[03:53:07] <JKarsrud> pastie.org then
[03:53:19] <asdf`> ssj, you can use jsfiddle.net instead or bpaste.net or many more. Pastebin.com has lotsa ads anyway :(
[03:53:44] <JKarsrud> ssj; you don't get any data back at all, is that the problem?
[03:53:51] <JKarsrud> you need to paste more than that, imo
[03:54:10] <ssj> http://sharetext.org/CY2M
[03:54:12] <ssj> here :P
[03:54:18] <ssj> JKarsrud yup
[03:54:22] <ssj> no data returned
[03:54:25] <ssj> i changed it a lil
[03:54:40] <ssj> JKarsrud the one i showed before returns yes
[03:54:50] <ssj> but the one on sharetext.org returns nuthing
[03:55:09] <JKarsrud> have you tried passing an object to data?
[03:55:26] <ssj> nope
[03:56:01] <ssj> umm
[03:56:06] <ssj> let me try that then
[03:58:32] <lugzer> toggle() callback can have only one function for animation complete, and can't have two for alternating animations, right?
[03:59:28] <JKarsrud> ssj; you're trying to do a get request, amirite?
[04:00:21] <JKarsrud> lugzer: correct
[04:01:13] <lugzer> JKarsrud, thanks, i was just making sure that this http://jsfiddle.net/QBGzf/ -- is indeed a wrong thing
[04:01:49] <ssj> JKarsrud yup
[04:01:54] <ssj> and the object fked up
[04:02:06] <ssj> zogot asked me to do before
[04:03:45] <JKarsrud> ssj; the object does exactly what it's supposed to, if you see the URL in the console here; http://jsfiddle.net/PfGsQ/
[04:05:48] <palani> hi hi
[04:06:08] <palani> am new for jquery concepts
[04:07:08] <citizenkeys> why doesn't this work:   $('#dialogChannelAddForm').submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); }
[04:07:14] <JKarsrud> ssj: Do you have _anywhere_ we can test this?
[04:07:20] <palani> any 1 s there
[04:08:00] <JKarsrud> ?ask @ palani
[04:08:01] <bot-t> palani, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:08:11] <JKarsrud> :)
[04:08:12] <ssj> umm JKarsrud that works
[04:08:47] <ssj> not in IE JKarsrud :P
[04:08:58] <ssj> it wud give transport error in IE
[04:09:19] <JKarsrud> which IE? 9?
[04:10:05] <sorcerer86pt> hi all
[04:10:14] <palani> i want to know how to code for Add more details in javascript
[04:10:17] <AdvoWork> JKarsrud, so instead of vendor_item_id use data-vendor_item_id ? and then change the id to unique id, and add class?
[04:10:42] <sorcerer86pt> hello
[04:10:56] <sorcerer86pt> anyone know how i can do the following in jquery
[04:11:30] <sorcerer86pt> i want an menu that colapses and expands at the click of an p tag
[04:11:50] <sorcerer86pt> the caveat is that the colapse is parcial
[04:11:53] <Zogot> you want us to do it for you? or your stuck trying it yourself?
[04:12:01] <sorcerer86pt> it is to stay with an 10px of height
[04:12:07] <sorcerer86pt> stuck
[04:12:18] <Zogot> ?demo @ sorcerer86pt
[04:12:18] <bot-t> sorcerer86pt, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[04:12:20] <sorcerer86pt> i know that i can use the slidetoogle
[04:13:12] <JKarsrud> AdvoWork: well, I'd skip the whole vendor_item_id if I were you, and just use a class for the change_data_expected, thingy. Then you'd use something like id="vii_74" and $('[id="vii' + 74 + '"]).data('date_expected_modified', someFormat);
[04:13:37] <JKarsrud> sorcerer86pt: if you give us the code you use now, that would be awesome :)
[04:14:00] <sorcerer86pt> i'm preparing an demo on jsfidle
[04:14:11] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys. I have this code: http://pastebin.com/SXifxy16 , as you can see on line 30, I load some items into the container. But I want it to continue loading whenever it's necessary - I mean when it's about to run out of items (when it scrolls - see from line 83). Right now when it reaches the limit, it set's margin-left to 0 and therefore restarts. If you need a demo, just tell me :)
[04:16:42] <jaffipaffi> A bit like when you're reaching the footer on facebook/twitter, then it loads more
[04:17:36] <sorcerer86pt> http://jsfiddle.net/Te49Y/1/
[04:17:47] <sorcerer86pt> the ideia is the p#menuToogle
[04:18:05] <sorcerer86pt> will slide down/up the div#colapsed_menu
[04:18:23] <sorcerer86pt> but i want it when colapsed it will have 10px
[04:18:29] <sorcerer86pt> of height
[04:18:48] <sorcerer86pt> and hide the menu options
[04:19:13] <hravula> hi
[04:22:01] <hravula> I have a question..
[04:22:25] <Zogot> go for it
[04:24:20] <hravula> i want to restrict max chars in a text area using jquery, and I tried to put maxlength attr, this is working for all browsers but not for IE, any clue?
[04:28:16] <sorcerer86pt> most recent : http://jsfiddle.net/Te49Y/6/
[04:33:37] <Zogot> sorcerer86pt: ....and thats doing the slide for you?
[04:33:41] <Zogot> you sure?
[04:34:33] <sorcerer86pt> http://jsfiddle.net/Te49Y/11/
[04:34:37] <sorcerer86pt> corrected the script
[04:34:42] <sorcerer86pt> forgot the ''
[04:34:46] <sorcerer86pt> on selectors
[04:36:59] <sorcerer86pt> http://jsfiddle.net/Te49Y/15/
[04:37:07] <sorcerer86pt> well it slides the menu
[04:37:12] <sorcerer86pt> but not the container
[04:37:24] <sorcerer86pt> tried to do some css class jugling
[04:37:32] <sorcerer86pt> with max and colapsed
[04:39:05] <sorcerer86pt> http://jsfiddle.net/Te49Y/15/
[04:46:43] <sorcerer86pt> done
[04:46:57] <sorcerer86pt> http://jsfiddle.net/Te49Y/17/
[04:47:39] <AdvoWork> anyone got any ideas why this isnt working: http://jsfiddle.net/XwSWv/11/ im trying to on button press, change the text of a a href, which works, but im trying to insert html at the same time, which fails..
[04:48:07] <Jeroenem> hi, i'm stuck on creating a simple toggle view for one of my lists. I just cant get the next() .info to toggle -> http://jsfiddle.net/pzkjA/
[04:48:50] <AdvoWork> actually, i think .html fixes it
[04:50:24] <Anime> is there a notable performance difference when appending tags with $("<tag />") and an append or the plain tag in a string append("<tag attr='value'>blabla</tag>")?
[04:51:00] <jacobrask> Anime: try it on http://jsperf.com
[04:52:43] <Anime> hm, lets see
[04:53:41] <snagnever> how bad is use a inline js function call as in <a href="#" onclick="addFund(234)"> ?
[04:53:57] <snagnever> *return addFund(234)
[04:54:24] <jacobrask> Anime: regardless, unless you've clearly noticed something is running slow I'd probably write it the way you consider the most readable
[04:55:36] <Anime> i did notice something slow, but its not even that. im removing a class from 15 to ~30 elements and it freezes for half a second or so
[04:55:54] <snagnever> pls? ;
[04:56:20] <Anime> use .on() snagnever
[04:56:52] <jacobrask> for CSS rendering, recent Opera and WebKit builds have a CSS profiler where you can see how much time rendering takes
[05:02:00] <snagnever> anime i have a php-generated table, where each element has its own db id. how would i use 'on' and use this id as argument?
[05:07:28] <Anomie21> Anyone reccomend a jquery script to pull a RSS feed in? Most links I'm finding via google are dead
[05:10:09] <DukeDrake> Anomie21: I think you should pull a RSS on the server and then simply deliver the content
[05:10:52] <Anime> snag, $("table").on({ click: function(e) { ... e.target.id has the value you want }}, "a");
[05:11:24] <Anime> if that's really a <table>, just going by what you said
[05:13:27] <shwaiil> hi
[05:13:46] <shwaiil> Q: How to use cursor key -> with keyup() ? I want to use a function when that key is pressed. thanks
[05:14:08] <shwaiil> from http://api.jquery.com/keyup/ I know the keycode is 39
[05:17:20] <Anomie21> DukeDrake: Why? I'm using PaRSS - http://www.killstone.net/software/parss/#comment-28
[05:18:47] <Sewa> Hi, iam new here and i have a question: i cant get .sortable( "refresh" ) working. I have a draggable and a Sortable working together. I kann add draggables to the list. in receive event i make the DB-saving via ajax and generate a new element in the list and remove the dropped element (placeholder) . then i want to refresh the sortable to recognize the new element. but that doesnt work for me.. i tryed many ways but nothing is working..
[05:20:42] <Anime> shwaiil: $(document).keyup( function(e) { if (e.keyCode == 39) { what_you_want_to_do(); } });
[05:20:49] <Anime> ?
[05:21:09] <Hooloovoork> Sewa: make a jsfiddle
[05:21:27] <Sewa> sorry, but what is that?
[05:21:40] <shwaiil> Anime: thanks a lot =)
[05:22:05] <DukeDrake> Anomie21: ô.o
[05:22:14] <Hooloovoork> ?jsfiddle @ Sewa
[05:22:15] <bot-t> Sewa, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[05:22:26] <DukeDrake> Anomie21: shouldn't there be an issue with loading data via ajax from remote sites?
[05:22:32] <Hooloovoork> ?botsnack
[05:22:32] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[05:22:54] <Sewa> bot-t: thx i have a look
[05:22:55] * bot-t sighs
[05:25:17] <seutje> robots get all the love...
[05:25:46] <Anomie21> DukeDrake: Not sure, I was genuinely asking why - pretty new to this stuff. People in the comments appear to have it working though?
[05:36:24] <sasori> how to remove the "action" attribute value of the <form> tag , when an input type=image is click through a certain condition ?
[05:39:58] <Ortund> sasori what would the form do if you took out the action attribute? What would it's purpose be?
[05:40:37] <sasori> or maybe, just disable the "action" e.g when $_SESSION['blabhblah'] is empty on a condition...is that possible ?
[05:45:42] <nikro> Hey guys, How can I simulate a click on an element that will propagate into all of its child-elements (with specific coordonates) ?
[05:46:28] <nikro> I created Event object with pageX and pageY and layerX and layerY and trigger a click on the 2nd element with this eventobject - and it doesn't propage :(
[05:46:33] <nikro> *propagate
[05:48:27] <CraniumSlows> Hi maybe someone can help me out. I'm trying to figure out jqgrid for an upcoming project and I need to be able to add data
[05:48:50] <CraniumSlows> I can see how to call editGridRow but is there a way for me to set parameters for when a user clicks the + sign?
[05:49:37] <CraniumSlows> The documentation seems to indicate it calls this method but I'm not sure where to put the default parameters
[05:50:26] <CraniumSlows> Is it really this dead with 885 other people in here?
[05:51:32] <shwaiil> Q: whats the best practice on .keyup() "bind to" $(document) or $(window) ? And why ? thanks!
[05:52:50] * CraniumSlows is sad
[05:55:21] <Sewa> Hooloovoork and bot-t thank you , i've done it.. found the mistake by myself
[05:55:40] <Sewa> with the help of Fiddle
[06:01:38] <Hooloovoork> Sewa: =)
[06:03:05] <developernotes> Is there anyway to know (possibly via callback) when a call to html(...) has completed? I have a line that executes something like $("a").attr("target", "_blank") just following a call to html(...) but does not affect the links.  When I execute the same command in Chrome console it works fine.  Any thoughts?
[06:04:37] <Sewa> Hooloovoork: in Fiddle my code works, so i checked my ajax answer code and there was the mistake.. the sortables are called listItem_xyz and the answer code was listitem_xy (small i) so it could not added to the sortable -> 5hours for this fu**ing one letter!
[06:04:39] <TahitiPetey> developernotes: .html function isn't async, you shouldn't need to have a callback/wait... Pastie your code?
[06:05:00] <developernotes> TahitiPetey: sure, just a sec.
[06:05:04] <TahitiPetey> Sewa: Typo hunting is the worst :(
[06:05:36] <developernotes> http://pastie.org/3172441
[06:06:00] <Hooloovoork> Sewa: lol! yea i've prolly got hundres of hours wasted cause of a single letter =P
[06:07:08] <TahitiPetey> developernotes: Code looks right... That's odd, it should be pretty straightforward.
[06:07:11] <Sewa> TahitiPetey and Hooloovork: now its done.. i see, other guys have the same problems :-)
[06:09:50] <rbd> hey guys... I'm having an issue where using a selector like "[class*=validate]" on Android takes FOREVER, but is very quick on all other platforms I've tested (desktop and iOS 4 and 5)...any idea why? not the best selector I know but it's not my code...
[06:14:12] <AdvoWork> Anyone got any suggestions about this. Got my datepicker working http://jsfiddle.net/XwSWv/12/ when i click it, it opens, with the date set as 13th, i click a date(25th) it sets it, if i re open the datepicker im expecting the 25th to be highlighted red, but its not. Any ideas please?
[06:14:51] <Hooloovoork> AdvoWork: you can set the date on the datepicker, right? just send in the set date when it's opened.
[06:19:49] <AdvoWork> Hooloovoork, i tried that though :S
[06:20:35] <Hooloovoork> i think i've done it like that before..
[06:21:36] <AdvoWork> Hooloovoork, just updated http://jsfiddle.net/XwSWv/13/  if you see after the alert, i do: $("#"+date_picker_id).datepicker('setDate', date_expected_modified);   and thats set to the 25th, but it doesnt show it as red/active or anything on the calendar
[06:22:56] <sorcerer86pt> hi
[06:23:13] <sorcerer86pt> anyone can tell me if the following is possible
[06:23:37] <sorcerer86pt> have an image set, in wich the last image/container
[06:23:48] <sorcerer86pt> is an plus sign that when pressed
[06:24:02] <sorcerer86pt> will fetch and expand that image set
[06:24:06] <sorcerer86pt> to contain all images
[06:24:11] <sorcerer86pt> instead of an few ones
[06:24:33] <zarex> its possible, think i've seen a plugin that does something like this
[06:24:37] <AdvoWork> Hooloovoork, do you see anything blindingly obvious where i've gone wrong or?
[06:24:40] <Hooloovoork> AdvoWork: i don't have time to look around so much, but i can see that is working.
[06:24:55] <Hooloovoork> AdvoWork: you just have to get it right =P it's changing the date sometimes
[06:25:24] <Hooloovoork> make sure the datestring you feed to the setDate function is correct and stuff.
[06:28:05] <AdvoWork> Hooloovoork, it is right afaik, its changing it in the link itself, but not on the actual calendar :/
[06:28:31] <Hooloovoork> check the documentation and see what it says there. =)
[06:29:28] <anticom> hi all
[06:29:36] <anticom> anyone familiar with jQuery ui dynatree here?
[06:30:24] <kborchers> anticom: not sure what you mean. UI does not have a dynatree widget
[06:30:38] <anticom> meant the plugin
[06:30:43] <anticom> sorry, ui was bit confusing
[06:30:51] <anticom> just added that, since it's a ui widget plugin
[06:31:01] <anticom> afaik at least :D
[06:31:15] <Ziggy> <div id="foo">foo<div id="bar">bar</div></div> $('#foo').text() -> results in foobar, how can I only get foo?
[06:32:22] <TahitiPetey> Ziggy: You can't have more than 1 id of the same "id"!
[06:32:34] <Ziggy> TahitiPetey: Are you blind?
[06:32:40] <TahitiPetey> Ziggy: Oops, yes :).
[06:32:51] <TahitiPetey> pushing 24 hours of no sleep ;).
[06:33:53] <TahitiPetey> Ziggy: Roundabout way of doing it would be to first get what's in #bar, then get the whole #foo, then splice out the previously stored #bar string.
[06:34:56] <Ziggy> ugh
[06:36:15] <kborchers> Ziggy: I think your only option would be to clone foo, remove the children from the clone then get the text
[06:36:24] <scratcha> hey all, I've written a simple script to slide background images on my page around. rather than just sliding to the next or previous image, i need to be able to jump to a specific image. i've written the following code but have hit a stumbling block. see the commented section (lines 18-22) here http://pastie.org/3172542
[06:37:09] <esiegel> Hey everyone, is there a way for me to select a class, but only when it is without an other class?
[06:37:33] <esiegel> For example, I was the ".tab" class but only if it doesn't also have the ".active" class.
[06:37:35] <esiegel> Thanks!
[06:38:01] <kborchers> esiegel: $(".tab").not(".active");
[06:38:06] <esiegel> thanks!
[06:38:23] <Ziggy> Well, my workaround will be diff, I'm gonna use the following -> <div id="foo"><span>foo</span><div id="bar">bar</div></div> -> $('#foo span:first').text();
[06:39:27] <anli_> $.cookie is local to a php file it seems, or is it?
[06:44:19] <anli_> Ah, got it, had to add options with path
[06:49:23] <purefusion2> is there a way to set a timeout on a .hover() so that a user can accidentally "mouseleave" the element for a period of time before the out handler is fired?
[06:51:00] <Hooloovoork> purefusion2: yes
[06:51:05] <Hooloovoork> use setTimeout =)
[06:51:08] <faianca> purefusion2, maybe using delay() before the hover
[06:51:25] <Hooloovoork> delay doesn't work like that
[06:51:33] <hravula> hey, how to restrict max characters in textarea?
[06:52:12] <Hooloovoork> hravula: check the current length of a textarea on keydown event and return false if it's more than you want to allow
[06:55:18] <Gorkyman> hey guys... can I somehow watch if css for one element changed? because I'm using @media css directives and I need to manipulate an element if it gets different stlye
[06:56:13] <Hooloovoork> Gorkyman: that could be tricky...
[06:58:28] <rethus> if i had set an iframe to style="display:none" can i toggle it visible with $('#iframename').show() ?
[06:59:37] <Hooloovoork> rethus: yup
[07:00:08] <hravula> Hooloovoork thanks, but how to control if it is copy/pasted from clipboard?
[07:00:17] <lb> hello, how may i jump to an specific anchor in an iframe from the outside of this iframe? manipulation via $("#iframe").attr('src', 'foo.html#anchor') doesnt work :/ it jumps back to the top
[07:00:41] <andrew9183> is there a plugin or method to test if user entered input is valid html/xml ?
[07:00:50] <lb> maybe you can give me a hint in the right direction
[07:01:48] <rethus> strange, didn't work
[07:02:16] <rethus> i try to use onsubmit="$('#name').show()" for a iframe
[07:02:20] <crankharder> I want to one-time rearrange/sort some LIs based on some function... is there a method for that?
[07:02:39] <rethus> the iframe has style="display:none" by default.. but onsubmit didn't togge it to visible
[07:02:56] <Hooloovoork> hravula: you could make a check... if($("#input").val().length > allowed_length) { $(this).empty().addClass("error") } or something
[07:03:44] <Hooloovoork> or you could possibly just return false in that case too
[07:03:46] <Hooloovoork> try and see
[07:04:21] <hravula> thanks
[07:04:29] <Hooloovoork> and the $(this) i did won't work =P
[07:04:41] <Hooloovoork> you have to type the proper selector there
[07:04:56] <Hooloovoork> unless ofc it's in the event callback
[07:05:11] <Hooloovoork> blah, i'm sure you'll figure that part out on your own=P
[07:07:14] <ajQuery> So nobody talking here? haa?
[07:07:22] <lb> you got it
[07:08:33] <ramkam001> hello
[07:08:57] <ajQuery> Hi @ramkam001
[07:08:58] <ramkam001> i have a question on jquery mobile
[07:09:22] <ajQuery> Okies. share it.
[07:10:16] <ramkam001> what's the best method to create the pages on fly (via javascript not via ajax calls), following to a click or touch on a button (for example)
[07:11:27] <ajQuery> If not ajax calls then how will you fetch new data and inject it on current page?
[07:11:30] <ramkam001> what i got used to in js was to have a function that builds a jqObject, and have another function put the contents at the right position
[07:11:35] <MagePsycho> hi there, can anybody suggest some good continuous scrolling extension with jQuery (similar to twiiter)
[07:11:53] <ramkam001> i have a large array of object ids and titles
[07:12:35] <ramkam001> the rest of the data is images, or can be loaded on request via ajax and adjust the object content when the $.get or post callback is triggered
[07:13:35] <ramkam001> the data could alse be embedded client side via localstorage or  websql
[07:13:51] <ramkam001> i want the page to work offline
[07:14:13] <Hooloovoork> MagePsycho: they're really easy to build, but google twitter scroll jquery and i'm sure you'll get lucky. =)
[07:14:21] <ramkam001> i was just wondering how to create to use jq Mobile, to create the page and then go to it
[07:15:02] <MagePsycho> hey Hooloovoork, can you guide me the core logic
[07:15:10] <MagePsycho> so that i can use with php/mysql
[07:15:16] <hravula> Hooloovoork: that didn't work :(
[07:15:35] <ajQuery> #ramkam001 Sorry buddy never dealt with such scenario. Have you checked for any better way around on StackOverflow.com? You can put up a question there. http://fb.me/ajquery. cya. not used to IRC chat.
[07:16:06] <Hooloovoork> hravula: make a jsfiddle =)
[07:17:20] <Taloncor> Is it possible to define the order in which certain event handlers are executed? I have two click handlers attached to one link and want handler 'A' to be executed before handler 'b'
[07:17:59] <ramkam001> ajQuery: i'll take a look at so. Does jqMobile allow to call a function, the then the function triggers the page change when it feels it should ?
[07:19:16] <ajQuery> well. It appears to be an need of a running interval function. How about that?
[07:19:20] <quicksilver> Taloncor: I think they're executed in the order you attach them bit more robust would be to attach one handler which just calls A then B.
[07:20:31] <Taloncor> quicksilver: Its a lot of unobtrusive javascript involved (rails .. ) and i would prefer to not change their event handlers
[07:21:59] <mordof> anyone know if there are plans to clean up jquery's code so that firebug doesn't hate it?
[07:22:23] <mordof> firebug upped it's standards - and jquery doesn't meet them
[07:22:41] <logicrises> does anybody know of a functioning page translator. Im trying to hook one onto a select input
[07:22:58] <logicrises> ive tried alot of plugins but no joy
[07:23:40] <t4nkd> hey jquery, what did I miss about writing a function? http://jsfiddle.net/V2jyr/2/
[07:24:20] <t4nkd> Really can't imagine why my function is 'undefined'
[07:28:51] <mordof> t4nkd: change where the code is placed
[07:29:11] <t4nkd> Sorry could you elaborate?
[07:29:13] <mantas322> Hello jQuery people
[07:29:24] <mordof> t4nkd: Choose Framwork -> no wrap (head)
[07:29:29] <mantas322> i just got some jQuery work so prepare yourselves for basic questions and alot of thinking out loud
[07:29:48] <mordof> t4nkd: if you run your code in onLoad, you're putting it in a closure
[07:29:54] <t4nkd> Ohhh
[07:29:56] <mordof> t4nkd: depending on how jsfiddle initializes it
[07:30:06] <mordof> t4nkd: so it's possible that the HTML is losing scope
[07:30:12] <mordof> scope issue rather
[07:30:14] <t4nkd> Okay so if I pull this function out out, for example, a document.ready
[07:30:20] <t4nkd> it should work in my implement
[07:30:25] <hravula> Hooloovoork: here it is - http://jsfiddle.net/hravula/NK2RG/
[07:30:51] <mordof> t4nkd: normal function calls don't need an onready
[07:31:06] <mordof> t4nkd: it's only stuff that you're calling right away that you want in the DOM ready call
[07:31:29] <t4nkd> Oh I see, that makes sense
[07:31:29] <mordof> t4nkd: and that's only if it's DOM manipulation stuff, it all depends on your scenario
[07:33:25] <byebyebyezzz> how can I generate randomnumber from 0-10 w/o duplicate?
[07:33:58] <mantas322> u'll have to record your numbers and compare new ones against that list
[07:33:58] <mordof> byebyebyezzz: generate a number between 0-10, and throw the result into an array, check if the result exists in the array .. if it does, generate a new one
[07:34:05] <mantas322> ^
[07:34:17] <byebyebyezzz> oh no shorter way to do it?
[07:34:20] <Hooloovoork> hravula: you had to run it on a event =)
[07:34:21] <Hooloovoork> http://jsfiddle.net/NK2RG/1/
[07:34:22] <Hooloovoork> that works
[07:34:22] <mordof> not really - it's a random number
[07:34:39] <byebyebyezzz> thx guys
[07:34:42] * mordof nods
[07:34:58] <mordof> so does nobody know if jquery intends to clean up their core code?
[07:36:39] <Hooloovoork> mordof: you think it needs cleaning?
[07:36:56] <klusias> hello. i got strings like "abc[2]", "abc[231]", how can i get these numbers - 2 and 231 out of?
[07:37:31] <Hooloovoork> klusias: check out substr()
[07:37:38] <Hooloovoork> or regex
[07:37:42] <Hooloovoork> or split
[07:37:43] <mantas322> parse em out
[07:39:51] <ura> hi
[07:41:48] <ura> To update some element I'm using $("div#myid").empty().append(dom_node). Is there an easier way to do this? Maybe there is something similar to Prototype's Element.update?
[07:43:29] <mordof> Hooloovoork: I don't tihnk it needs cleaning, it DOES need cleaning - firebug has been updated to detect the use of uninitialized variables
[07:43:41] <mordof> Hooloovoork: as such, it throws breakpoints all over the place in jquery's code
[07:43:48] <mordof> Hooloovoork: i can't load any site with firebug already on
[07:44:49] <neocrk> mordof I am not seeing this issue on my system with uninit vars
[07:45:01] <mordof> neocrk: what version of jquery, firebug, and firefox are you running?
[07:45:53] <Hooloovoork> mordof: you you find so many just clean them out and do a pull request to jquery.
[07:45:55] <neocrk> jquery = 1.6.4, firebug 1.9.0, ff 9.0.1
[07:46:32] <mordof> Hooloovoork: that's easier said than done
[07:46:37] <mordof> neocrk: interesting...
[07:46:44] <mordof> neocrk: i wonder why mine is behavingas it is then
[07:47:06] * lapas kas 2x2 off
[07:47:30] <mordof> I was wondering why this wasn't reported all over the forums - but then i'm wondering why this is happening to my install
[07:47:33] * mordof thinks
[07:47:35] <neocrk> mordof: I have no idea, which version you using of jquery?
[07:48:21] <mordof> neocrk: 1.7.1, but that doesn't have much bearing on the problem. this started a bit ago with an update to firebug
[07:48:45] <mordof> i'm assuming jquery has always been littered with uninitialized variables, as it is technically allowed in js
[07:49:03] <neocrk> mordof: ok, what about plugins in firefox? I only use NoScript (disabled for my trusted sites) and Firebug
[07:49:07] <xarxer> Doesn't relative paths work in $.get?
[07:49:17] <xarxer> oh
[07:49:21] <mordof> neocrk: just web developer toolbar
[07:49:22] <xarxer> scratch that
[07:49:33] <mordof> neocrk: if updating firebug doesnt' sovle it, i'll remove that
[07:50:34] <neocrk> mordof: before doing so, I'd suggest diabling all other plugins and enable only firebug to see if issue persists
[07:51:00] <mordof> neocrk: testing that now
[07:51:09] <tobago> gosh! almost 1000 people! jquery is huge!
[07:51:23] <mordof> neocrk: still continues :\
[07:51:53] <mantas322> it only going to get worse once more and more people like me show up
[07:52:18] <mantas322> disenfranchised haters
[07:52:26] <mordof> lol
[07:52:26] <neocrk> mordof: what OS?
[07:52:30] <mordof> neocrk: ubuntu
[07:52:56] <mordof> i think i'll back up my bookmarks and completely delete my mozilla profile
[07:53:00] <mordof> might be something conflicting
[07:53:23] <neocrk> mordof: I'll give it a test in sec, booting vm
[07:53:30] <mordof> neocrk: thanks for the help :)
[07:53:51] <mordof> if it can be recreated then it's not just my install - but it's seriously frustrating me as i have to kill firebug every page refresh
[07:54:09] <neocrk> mordof: no prob
[07:55:07] * mordof deletes the .mozilla folder
[07:56:30] <tobago> what is the best jquery lib for creating barcharts, ganttcharts, pies and stuff? jqplot?
[07:56:43] <tobago> i additionally need to set tooltips on barcharts.
[07:56:47] <tobago> any suggestions?
[07:57:13] <mordof> neocrk: yeah - it must've been an odd conflict with my profile
[07:57:28] <mordof> neocrk: after deleting the .mozilla folder and rebooting + install firebug, the same page doesn't give the problem anymore
[07:57:46] <neocrk> mordof: cool happy to hear issue resolved
[07:58:18] <mordof> neocrk: mhmm :) now i'm just curious as to what exactly caused it
[07:58:19] <mordof> lol
[07:58:29] <mordof> i wonder if i'll even be able to discover that
[07:58:38] <mantas322> lol linkanus.com
[07:59:05] <neocrk> mordof: if you have not deleted but simply moved to old .mozilla folder you could have diff'd it ;-)
[07:59:16] <mordof> neocrk: it's still in my trash - i can pull it out
[07:59:19] <mordof> i don't know how to do that though
[07:59:59] <mordof> neocrk: installed all my add-ons, still no problem.
[08:00:00] <mordof> hm
[08:00:12] <neocrk> mordof: I'll double check the syntax
[08:00:18] <mordof> thanks - i'll pull it out
[08:01:06] <mordof> Hooloovoork: apparently it was a single case issue, heh
[08:01:13] <Hooloovoork> mordof: =P
[08:01:47] <mordof> Hooloovoork: seems odd though really - how does a single glitch in a profile manage to cause firebug to breakpoint on undefined variable use. is that property possible to be set somewhere in firebug?
[08:01:51] <mordof> do you know, anyway.. lol
[08:02:22] <mordof> i shall ask in #firebug if it exists
[08:02:25] <mordof> or #mozilla
[08:03:56] <webPragmatist> what's the best way to update a live feed ?
[08:03:56] <neocrk> mordof: initially see what you get with: diff -r .mozilla restored_mozilla
[08:03:58] <webPragmatist> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2798785/jquery-plugin-to-update-live-a-li-from-php
[08:04:09] <mordof> neocrk: alright, hold on
[08:04:11] <mordof> neocrk: i'll gist it
[08:04:21] <neocrk> mordof obviously replace restored_mozilla with you actual restored profile
[08:04:26] <mordof> yeah for sure, lol
[08:04:54] <mordof> neocrk: i know it's necessary to point that out sometimes, heh - i'm past that point though at least :)
[08:05:40] * neocrk notes mordof not a n00b
[08:05:46] <neocrk> ;-)
[08:06:49] <mordof> neocrk: so.. firefox.last-version, firefox-trunk, and crash reports are only in my old .mozilla, and the only diff's that come up are profile paths really
[08:07:00] <mordof> neocrk: and install time obviously
[08:07:17] <neocrk> ok so it must be skipping the likes of the js files etc
[08:07:43] <neocrk> ok I'd say not worth hunting any further unless you are itching to find it
[08:08:28] <neocrk> you could try including -a switch which will tell diff to treat all files as text
[08:08:34] <mordof> neocrk: well.. i was kind of thinking if it were possible to be recreated that I could submit a bug - but I don't even know if it's worth that
[08:08:39] <mordof> neocrk: i'll try that and see what comes up
[08:08:51] <neocrk> cool
[08:09:09] <mordof> -a doesn't change anything o.o
[08:09:31] * mordof wonders if it's limited to a certain depth
[08:10:05] <mordof> that wouldn't make sense though since it's going into crash reports - those should be at least same depth as the profile .js files
[08:10:54] <mordof> neocrk: unless it has trouble with the folder name due to <name>.default , etc format
[08:11:09] <mordof> it might not be scanning them
[08:11:11] <neocrk> mordof: well -r = recursive so should doo all folders and -a is treat all as text
[08:11:17] <mordof> right
[08:11:36] <neocrk> but then even with . folders and files it reports them on mine when I try
[08:13:09] <mordof> neocrk: the profile names are different - it's not comparing because of that
[08:13:09] <Chettbi> Hello
[08:13:25] <mordof> neocrk: (my guess anyway) it's assuming because the folder is different that there's no reason to diff those files
[08:13:51] <neocrk> ok so you could run the diff against the actual full profile path
[08:13:58] * mordof nods
[08:14:37] <Chettbi> I've an "issue" using jquery ui draggable function
[08:14:53] <mordof> neocrk: there we go, lol.... *huge* amount of output
[08:15:06] <mordof> oh man..
[08:15:10] <mordof> this may have been a bad idea xD
[08:15:10] <mantas322> no loling in here.
[08:15:22] <DRSK> Best way to 'mark' a CPT post for start page visibility? Custom field, taxonomy or something else?
[08:15:31] <neocrk> lol
[08:16:05] <mordof> neocrk: scrolling output is WELL beyond output buffer :\
[08:16:22] <neocrk> mordof: lol
[08:16:30] <mordof> my scrollback is set to unlimited.. let's try this again
[08:16:37] * mordof hopes it doesn't completely destroy his computer
[08:16:54] <neocrk> mordof: you could perhaps re-issue and grep for firebug ;-)
[08:17:02] <EdwardIII> hey
[08:17:19] <EdwardIII> is there a simple example on how to make one image fly left out of the viewport while another image flies in from the right?
[08:17:25] <mordof> neocrk: yeah, i'm pretty sure it's capping at 600MB ram usage anyway
[08:17:30] <mordof> neocrk: even with unlimited scrollback
[08:17:36] <EdwardIII> at the moment i use fadeOut(..., $('.newElement').fadeIn()...
[08:17:56] <mordof> EdwardIII: animation
[08:18:08] <neocrk> mordof: lol, up to you. not always the simplist to track this issues down
[08:18:29] <mordof> neocrk: yeah, it's been massive scrolling for a while - i'm just gonna let the issue drop and purge the old profiles
[08:19:09] <EdwardIII> mordof: how do i track "off the screen"? work out width of viewport then send it left of that?
[08:19:39] <mordof> EdwardIII: left off the screen is negative image width - 1, right off the screen is viewport width + image width + 1
[08:20:21] <mordof> EdwardIII: left off the screen is easier, as 0 will always be the left
[08:21:55] <EdwardIII> mordof: ah, of course
[08:23:08] <EBisumaru> Hey, anyone got a good tutorial for explaining the $ object, and chaining?
[08:24:27] <EBisumaru> I'm reading one on 'authenticsociety' but it's fairly confusing
[08:24:46] <mantas322> I think the $ is just an alias to jQueryy....
[08:24:58] <mantas322> nom sayin'
[08:25:03] <mantas322> i could be wrong
[08:25:12] <quicksilver> EBisumaru: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials
[08:25:29] <quicksilver> try "How jQuery Works" by john reisg
[08:29:02] <mordof> mantas322: yeah, $ = jQuery in terms of use. it's an alias
[08:29:56] <mantas322> mordof, nice
[08:30:02] <mantas322> im learnign here
[08:30:08] <mantas322> first day doing jQuery btw
[08:30:27] <Eviltwin> Have you done much JavaScript before?
[08:30:51] <mantas322> weeks worth
[08:32:09] <xarxer> I am aware of $.browser i jQuery, but is there any way to get the name of the browser?
[08:36:06] <snagnever> isn't .on() supposed to attach the same handler to new elements?
[08:37:34] <kamika> Hi, does anyone know a jQuery plugin for playing continuous music in a website... using ajax maybe.. ?!?!??
[08:38:16] <dabear> snagnever: no, not neccessarily
[08:38:21] <dabear> ?on
[08:38:22] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:39:16] <dabear> snagnever: you need to specify the selector for that to work: on( events [, selector] [, data], handler(eventObject) )
[08:39:18] <snagnever> dabear but, how would make that work? i mean, before we were supposed to use .live(), now we should use .on()
[08:40:44] <dabear> snagnever: $("#bar ").live("click", fn) is basically the same as $(document).on("click", "#bar")
[08:40:47] <dabear> ,fn
[08:41:14] <quicksilver> the documentation for on gives an example of how to convert .live() queries to .on()
[08:41:54] <snagnever> $('#ranking table tbody').on('click', 'a.add_comparacao', function(){ addToComparacao($(this).closest('tr').data('id')); return false; });
[08:42:21] <snagnever> quicksilver yes, i know, i'm doing it. but it's not happening, do i have to call something after creating the elements?!
[08:43:04] <quicksilver> no, you don't.
[08:43:49] <quicksilver> as long as any newly added a.add_comparacao are *inside* the #ranking table tbody that is correct
[08:44:03] <quicksilver> it won't work on newly added tables of course
[08:44:11] <quicksilver> only the tables which exist when you bind.
[08:44:58] <snagnever> quicksilver aaaah yeah, thanks... the problem is that i'm creating new tbodies
[08:45:04] <snagnever> just attached to table now and works
[08:45:06] <snagnever> thanks a lot ;D
[08:46:04] <snagnever> a dobut: does being more 'specific' give a better performance? the selector 'table tr td a.class' is 'faster' than 'table a.class' ?
[08:46:48] <ansimation> anyone want to help me figure out why my images here sometimes randomly do not get centered in the browser window? you'll have to click and image then click enlarge, click the modal to close the image and then the thumbnail link is on the bottom right of the image. here's the url to the site http://173.168.172.225/rspline/portfolio-category/interactive/ and to the code http://pastebin.com/Y2t3krik which is in portfolio.zoom ( lines 36-46)
[08:47:01] <quicksilver> well it only matters if you have lots of clicks on lots of different elements
[08:47:03] <quicksilver> and loads of handles
[08:47:24] <quicksilver> in that case what matters is keeping the first selector specific (the $('#ranking table') part)
[08:47:34] <dabear> snagnever: don't worry about performance here
[08:47:50] <quicksilver> performance only matters when it matters ;)
[08:48:03] <quicksilver> if you design a web application with scrolling panes and over 800 elements listening for click events
[08:48:05] <mantas322> everything is comming along nicely so far
[08:48:06] <quicksilver> then you care, I think.
[08:48:22] <EAN407> when using the jquery.ui draggable & dropable functionality there is a little bug. if i drag&drop an item and directly after drop trying to drag it again it the image get marked. http://jsfiddle.net/tBWGc/ . is this normal?
[08:48:44] <snagnever> thanks dabear!
[08:52:09] <snagnever> is it ok to use handler(){ $(this).closest('[data-id]') } to get the closest element that has an data.('id') ?
[08:52:17] <snagnever> cause it might be a li or a tr
[08:52:43] <shwaiil> Q: on .animate() where it says "step: A function to be called after each step of the animation." for something like left -= 1 step refers to this step completing or  each -= 1 ? t ks
[08:52:58] <t4nkd> How do I turn a javascript escaped string into HTML for use with .append() ?
[08:55:44] <snagnever> i guess t4nkd unescape()
[08:55:55] <t4nkd> yeah that's not workin' :\
[08:56:44] <sorcerer86pt> quick question
[08:57:21] <sorcerer86pt> if i try to create an img in jquery
[08:57:29] <sorcerer86pt> wich folder is the base
[08:57:36] <sorcerer86pt> the root dir of the site
[08:57:41] <sorcerer86pt> or where the script is
[08:58:57] <Brodingo> sorcerer86pt i would think whatever the path of the page unless your using a base tag
[08:59:04] <a_ok> I have set a change() trigger on a radio button. But .val() always returns "yes" even when "no" is selected. What am I doing wrong?
[08:59:27] <doom777> what is jquery-mobile channel room?
[08:59:28] <sorcerer86pt> how so
[08:59:46] <mantas322> ur in it
[08:59:47] <mantas322> BRAH
[09:00:06] <Brodingo> also #jquerymobile
[09:00:08] <Brodingo> see topic
[09:00:24] <t4nkd> okay more explicit question
[09:00:25] <t4nkd> How do I convert this string back to HTML? unescape() didn't work on it... &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input id=&quot;device_blocked_phrases_attributes_1326387514901_phrase&quot; ...(and so on)
[09:03:08] <a_ok> never mind just found out i need the checked selector
[09:08:12] <mantas322> okay
[09:08:22] <mantas322> here's what im going to need to investigate
[09:08:48] <mantas322> can I have a text file with a commma deliminated list that will contain words for the purpose of auto complete?
[09:09:17] <mantas322> so I have a search box and I want the auto complete to start guessing what the user is typing
[09:09:22] <mantas322> this is doable correct?
[09:09:30] <mantas322> tyhis is also going to be for a mobile website
[09:09:32] <Germanaz0> t4nkd: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1912501/unescape-html-entities-in-javascript
[09:09:35] <Germanaz0> there is the answer
[09:09:43] <mantas322> right?
[09:10:09] <Germanaz0> mantas322: a sec
[09:10:30] <mantas322> im leaving for lunch I will read your responses and thoughts when i return
[09:11:41] <TehRabbitt> I think i'm doing this wrong, but how can I combine the values of lets say 5 variables into one string?
[09:11:41] <TehRabbitt> 		var totItem = Brand.val() + ' ' + Model.val() + ' ' + CPU.val() + ' ' + RAM.val() ;
[09:11:52] <TehRabbitt> it's telling me "totItem is not a function"
[09:12:28] <EBisumaru> So, JS/HTML is really forgiving when it comes to errors, but debugging can be really confusing because you don't know what silently broke. Is there some kind of stricter execution environment you can use?
[09:12:47] <Germanaz0> mantas322: http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[09:12:55] <alexr2> i'm getting a parsererror when using $.getScript... anyone have any suggestions?
[09:13:02] <Germanaz0> watch the multiple select
[09:13:41] <EBisumaru> alexr2: you may want to include some context with that
[09:14:10] <theBrettman> does anyone else have problems with jsfiddle displaying absolute positioning?
[09:14:16] <TehRabbitt> hm 		var totItem = $(Brand.val() + ' ' + Model.val() + ' ' + CPU.val() + ' ' + RAM.val()) ; gives me "undefined"
[09:14:41] <theBrettman> I get an error in jsfiddle that says absolute is not defined
[09:15:48] <aminho> hi all, could anyone help to serialize an element attributes, exemple href=url&id=uid for <a href="url" id="uid">anchor text</a>
[09:15:57] <alexr2> i'm loading a script the good old fashioned <script src="blahblahblah.js"></script> way, which loads up jquery (encapsulated) and i pass that jquery variable to another script i load dynamically using $.getScript.  i pass just by var myObj = new Obj(jQuery).  when i run a $.ajax script load from inside my Obj class, i get a parser error as the textStatus
[09:18:36] <TehRabbitt> if varA.val() == Test1 and varB.val() == Test2, how can I combine them so varC.val() == Test1,Test2
[09:19:44] <a_ok> How do I check the correct radiobutton?
[09:21:24] <a_ok> I dont have id's just name and value
[09:21:50] <Taloncor> TehRabbitt: varC.val() == Test1 + '' + Test2 should do the trick
[09:22:15] <alexr2> a_ok, the selector should just be $("input[name=value]") i believe
[09:23:45] <a_ok> alexr2: yes but when I set prop("checked", true); it sets the last radio (with radio's there are multiple with the same name)
[09:24:48] <a_ok> I have also tried $(input[name="bla"],[value="M"])
[09:25:04] <alexr2> if you know positionwise where they are, do :nth-child(5)
[09:25:37] <alexr2> no comma between the two attributes
[09:25:59] <alexr2> $('input[name="bla"][value="M"]')
[09:26:17] <aminho> I tried $('#uid').attributes.serialize()
[09:26:38] <aminho> but i can't get to serialize an element's attributes
[09:28:29] <a_ok> alexr2: thanks!
[09:28:40] <alexr2> a_ok, no problem
[09:29:38] <a_ok> alexr2: when I use the comma I select all with name="bla" AND value="M" ?
[09:30:26] <alexr2> i believe you select all the input[name="bla"] in addition to anything containing [value="m"]
[09:32:27] <nFFF> Two lines of code: http://jsfiddle.net/cWwaJ/

[09:33:51] <alexr2> your html was zoomPAd, you were searching for zoomPad
[09:34:38] <chriscalip> hello is it possible to execute jquery inside the modal Container of lightbox2 ; like inside the modalContainer of there is an input textfield an i want to do stuff with that textfield
[09:35:36] <alexr2> you should try it :-)
[09:36:39] <a_ok> should have known that... thanks again
[09:36:47] <alexr2> a_ok, no problem
[09:40:22] <ziggles> Any plugin suggestions for nice implementations of drag/drop list reordering?
[09:40:55] <alexr2> ziggles, i think jquery-ui has something for drag/drop sorting
[09:41:16] <ziggles> alexr2: it does -- http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[09:41:26] <ziggles> alexr2: but was just hoping to check out other people's implementations
[09:42:13] <NoiseEee> ziggles: how many implementations could there be really?
[09:42:46] <ziggles> NoiseEee: 3156
[09:43:04] <ziggles> NoiseEee: :) how many carousel implementations are there?
[09:45:31] <EAN407> http://jsfiddle.net/4yE8S/ everytime after a drag&drop if you drag again 0,5 or 1 second after drop the image gets marked. any idea what could cause this?
[09:52:32] <EAN407> no one got a clue?
[09:54:11] <kavelot> I have a $('.myclass').each() setting a click()... inside the click() function, can I know if this was called from a ".header .myclass" or ".footer .myclass"?
[09:54:13] <sokie> doesnt happen in my browser
[09:54:26] <kavelot> (it's not the direct parent)
[09:54:51] <aximilation> I think I see what you're talking about, it's like it is disabled EAN407
[09:55:11] <EAN407> yeah
[09:55:13] <EAN407> it seems like
[09:55:14] <ravenzz> EAN407 I see that, but I have no idea why it happen
[09:55:30] <EAN407> the demo at the jquery.ui docu doesnt seem to behave like this
[09:57:46] <EAN407> is this a common issue?
[09:57:51] <EAN407> or just my "mistake" ?
[09:58:21] <mordof> kavelot: have you found a solution to your question yet?
[09:58:50] <alexr2> I'm having issues loading javascript using jquery.  It's easiest to explain through code, so please see below. The alert returns parsererror.  If I load jquery 1.7.1 in the index file, there is no issue loading with ajax, but if I exclude it (like in the code), there is an issue.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.   http://pastebin.com/9erYQciK
[09:59:06] <mordof> EAN407: checking
[09:59:20] <EAN407> thank you very much :)
[10:00:02] <Zucca> I'm trying to build a function that goes trough my nested array. Array has several lines like this: array['ArrayKeyX'] = [ 'value1', valueN' ]; I want to go trough all "values". If a value matches a string then return ArrayKeyX. I haven't had any luck in this. It always fails. It's been some time since I last coded using jquery. Does anyone have knowledge for simple loop to do this?
[10:00:41] <alexr2> $.each(array, function(index, value) {
[10:00:43] <alexr2> });
[10:00:55] <mordof> really.. you use jquery for that?
[10:00:57] * mordof sighs
[10:01:04] <mordof> = the biggest reason i hate jquery
[10:01:26] <alexr2> looping through arrays?
[10:01:34] <ajpiano> you hate jQuery because it has a seamless iterator for objects and arrays that gives you a closure that you'll often need anyway?
[10:01:56] <mordof> i hate jquery because it causes people to not know how to do simple things in js, the language they're actually working with
[10:02:04] <mordof> and become so reliant on jquery that they can't do without
[10:02:10] <aximilation> empower the people!
[10:02:10] <Zucca> mordof: I not just for that. If jquery is already loaded then why not to take advantage of it.
[10:02:23] <ajpiano> mordof: do you also hate cars because they force people not to walk everwhere
[10:02:30] <mordof> ajpiano: people still know how to walk
[10:02:35] <mordof> ajpiano: that's not even close to the proper analogy
[10:02:36] <kavelot> mordof has a good point
[10:02:39] <aximilation> I think I would hate cars if ... ^
[10:02:42] <alexr2> lol.. it's a lot easier to user $.each instead of for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i ++) { }
[10:02:52] <ajpiano> mordof: i agree that it's important that people know basic constructs like how to write a for loop
[10:03:02] <aximilation> easier yes, but when you don't know the basics of how js works...
[10:03:05] <mordof> looping through an array is a basic for javascript
[10:03:11] <niloy> mordof: hate the people, not jquery
[10:03:19] <mordof> indeed
[10:03:23] <alexr2> well, that's more of a lack of programming skills than a lack of javascript skills
[10:03:34] <Zucca> mordof: If I weren't using any code that needs jquery I'd plan it with pure js ofcourse.
[10:03:49] <mordof> well
[10:03:54] <aximilation> typical programming issues, I look at people different because they don't know how to build a computer and install an OS from scratch, doesn't mean they aren't compotent in using it and even developing some code
[10:03:56] <mordof> no code *needs* jquery, but.. yeah
[10:04:14] <alexr2> more often than not, something as easy as a loop is much faster using plain old javascript
[10:04:22] <aximilation> it's curious when people do not have the fundamentals down
[10:04:27] <mordof> alexr2: right
[10:04:38] <ajpiano> more often than not the inefficiencies in your application are not your loop structures
[10:04:49] <alexr2> hahaha very true
[10:04:59] <mordof> anyway
[10:05:00] <ajpiano> if the only performance problem in your app is the speed of $.each vs. for (...), then congrats, buy yourself a cocktail
[10:05:08] <mordof> ajpiano: yeah, true, lol
[10:05:09] <aximilation> me too please
[10:05:24] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: Could someone buy me a cocktail instead?
[10:05:29] <mordof> ajpiano: but if that's the ONLY reason you're using jquery, then.. yeah.. still really bad xD
[10:05:44] <mordof> huge bloat ftl
[10:05:45] <ajpiano> mordof: i would certainly also hope people don't *only* load jQuery because they want $.each :)
[10:05:55] <Brodingo> Eviltwin cant you use your $128+ dollars from your pledgie?
[10:05:56] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: done
[10:05:58] <mordof> ajpiano: unfortunately not knowing the alternative leads people to do so
[10:06:21] <Zucca> Unfortunately.
[10:06:26] <ajpiano> i think you might be overgeneralising a bit
[10:06:45] <mordof> possibly - but that last scenario seemed like it fit that case quite well
[10:06:47] <ajpiano> i think that there's a lot of dom query/traversal/ajax stuff that people don't know how to do in pure js so they use jQuery... or because it's easier than doing it in pure JS
[10:06:50] <Eviltwin> mordof: I added this tidbit
[10:06:51] <Eviltwin> ?learn
[10:06:51] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[10:06:53] <ajpiano> people who don't know how to write lopos on the other hand...
[10:07:01] <ajpiano> loops*
[10:07:03] <mordof> Eviltwin: nice :) thanks
[10:07:16] <Eviltwin> It's important that people understand intermediate and at least some advanced JavaScript before doing jQuery
[10:07:17] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: also as long as i'm around, i also added this tidbit
[10:07:24] <alexr2> man that sparked quite a bit of discussion
[10:07:28] <sokie> if everyone knews how stuff works, we wernt be able to earn money:D
[10:07:28] <mordof> heh
[10:07:36] <mordof> sokie: that's not true
[10:07:39] <ajpiano> ?offtopic commodities trading
[10:07:39] <bot-t> While a little bit of off-topic banter is generally harmless, extended discussion of commodities trading is off-topic for the#jquery channel, so let's please move on.
[10:07:42] <Eviltwin> Because jQuery uses intermediate JS techniques from day 1 and advanced JS techniques from day 2
[10:07:48] <mordof> sokie: if everyone knew how stuff worked (in what they were interested in) the web would be a much cleaner place
[10:08:10] <Zucca> mordof: I wouldn't be asking that question here if I wasn't using jquery already. If it was otherwise I'd /join #javascript.
[10:08:16] <Eviltwin> If you don't understand advanced JavaScript, at some point you'd end up blindly plugging jQuery snippets together
[10:08:43] <Brodingo> sounds like my friday night
[10:08:53] <alexr2> sooo... anyone http://pastebin.com/9erYQciK ? alert returns parsererror ?
[10:09:06] <sokie> nah, most people need to have their pages set up. they dont really bother to learn web standards
[10:09:17] <mordof> EAN407: i don't know jquery UI, so my first initial place to check would be is there a delay between the mouseup and the attachment to the DOM?
[10:10:13] <mordof> EAN407: is there a possibility that your hooks you're placing the draggable on is not being hit before the append to the DOM takes place?
[10:13:44] <Zucca> Anyway currently I'm using $.each to go trough arrays in parent array. Inside each I have if sentence to check if $.inArray results to > -1.
[10:14:05] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ Zucca
[10:14:05] <bot-t> Zucca, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[10:14:23] <Zucca> Thanks. -->
[10:14:44] <mantas322> Thanks Germanaz0
[10:14:58] <mantas322> but to do u think multiple select will work for 5000 items?
[10:15:56] <EAN407> mordof, that could be. i dont really know. any idea how i can fix this?
[10:16:11] <mordof> EAN407: http://jsfiddle.net/4yE8S/  I added a mousedown return false - it prevents the second drag, but the delay from the jquery UI draggable is still there
[10:16:26] <mordof> I don't know jquery UI well enough to know what it's catching on
[10:17:01] <TehRabbitt> Taloncor1: okay this is weird, I tried the code you posted above with the Test1 + test2 example, modified it slightly (renames variables but used same syntax) but it's telling me i'm missing an ";" before statement
[10:17:27] <TehRabbitt> 	var totItem.val() = Brand + ' ' + Model;
[10:17:49] <mordof> TehRabbitt: you don't apply values like that
[10:17:51] <mordof> () is a method
[10:18:00] <Ziggy> using $('body').delegate('.elem', 'mouseenter mouseleave', function(e) { // How can I access a element inside the .elem parent div? });
[10:18:10] <mordof> TehRabbitt: you can't apply data on the return value from a method, it's read-only
[10:18:19] <monover> should a selector of ':not(selector1, selector2)' match any element on the page other than the two specified in :not()?
[10:18:21] <TehRabbitt> mordof: so how do I take the value of Brand and value of Model, and combine them into one vai?
[10:18:23] <TehRabbitt> var*

[10:18:54] <bot-t> TehRabbitt, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[10:19:07] <mordof> TehRabbitt: ignore the first one
[10:19:12] <mordof> TehRabbitt: go learn some javascript please
[10:19:39] <TehRabbitt> mordof: :-\ i'm just asking because it seems it should be easier to combine them than it really is
[10:19:55] <Taloncor1> TehRabbitt: if you wanna test for equality you should use == instead of =
[10:19:58] <alexr2> var finalvalue = Brand + Model
[10:20:01] <mordof> TehRabbitt: I'm telling you that because that's one of the *easiest* and most fundamentally basic things about javascript
[10:20:08] <mordof> TehRabbitt: you should learn some javascript
[10:20:52] <overthemike> hey room
[10:20:53] <Eviltwin> ?.val @ TehRabbitt
[10:20:53] <bot-t> TehRabbitt, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[10:21:03] <Eviltwin> On that page, it tells you how to set a value
[10:21:16] <TehRabbitt> mordof: well I know that "				label.setObjectText("TECH",  'TechID: ' + Tech.val());" works... yet I can't seem to assign the values (val()) of the other variables, and combine them into one new variable
[10:21:17] <mordof> Eviltwin: he wasn't actually trying to set a value of an element, but rather just create a simple variable
[10:21:59] <TehRabbitt> var varC= varA.val() + varB.val(); == "Undefined"
[10:22:08] <TehRabbitt> varc.val() == undefined
[10:22:18] <TehRabbitt> varC.val()* sorry
[10:22:31] <overthemike> varC.val() doesn't exist
[10:22:41] <overthemike> .val() is a jQuery metho
[10:22:43] <overthemike> method*
[10:22:51] <overthemike> can only be used on jquery objects
[10:22:52] <mordof> TehRabbitt: .val() isn't for variables, it's for input elements
[10:22:55] <lisak> how come this doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/CPDH4/2/ .... neither does this  http://jsfiddle.net/CPDH4/3/
[10:23:07] <mordof> TehRabbitt: what you're trying to do is simple variables, please do yourself a favor
[10:23:10] <mordof> ?learn @ TehRabbitt
[10:23:11] <bot-t> TehRabbitt, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[10:23:19] <mordof> TehRabbitt: you're struggling with basics, that first link *will* help you
[10:23:59] <alexr2> w3schools is also a good place to learn imo
[10:24:03] <mordof> ahh
[10:24:04] <mordof> NO  NO NO NO
[10:24:05] <TehRabbitt> mordof: I get how to take varA + varB and make it equal varC... it's just not working when i'm trying to incorporate the varA.val() + varB.val()
[10:24:06] <mordof> alexr2: NO
[10:24:13] <alexr2> or not
[10:24:13] <mordof> alexr2: w3schools is AWFUL
[10:24:15] <alexr2> lol
[10:24:20] <mordof> alexr2: it's IE-centric and gives bad advice!
[10:24:34] <mordof> it's a poor reference
[10:24:41] <mordof> Mozilla Developer Center is a good place
[10:24:49] <cybersholt> w3fools more like it
[10:24:56] <EAN407> mordof: you think i shall ask the question later . maybe someone is here who knows the issue
[10:25:00] <mordof> TehRabbitt: because .val() ISN'T for variables, it's for input elements, the DOM
[10:25:07] <mordof> EAN407: is there no channel for jquery UI?
[10:25:17] <kborchers> ?ask @ EAN407
[10:25:17] <bot-t> EAN407, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:25:19] <EAN407> mordof: no
[10:25:26] <TehRabbitt> mordof: correct, and I understand that....
[10:25:40] <TehRabbitt> var Brand = $('select[id*=manufacturer]');
[10:25:40] <TehRabbitt> 		var Model = $("input[id*=modelNumber]");
[10:25:49] <TehRabbitt> so Brand.val() and Model.val()
[10:25:59] <mordof> TehRabbitt: ok
[10:26:09] <TehRabbitt> need to become lets say result.... but i'm not sure how to combine the two of them together
[10:26:11] <EAN407> http://jsfiddle.net/4yE8S/ . if i drag&drop the pictures and try to drag it 500 ms or 1 seconds after the drop the image gets marked and not moved
[10:26:17] <TehRabbitt> sorry maybe I was being confusing refering to them as variables
[10:26:29] <mordof> TehRabbitt: var varname = Brand.val() + ' ' + Model.val();
[10:26:33] <Taloncor1> lisak: Whats your trouble? Your first example works
[10:27:03] <mordof> TehRabbitt: then when you want to use varname, simple type varname
[10:27:07] <mordof> TehRabbitt: don't add .val() to it
[10:27:12] <mordof> TehRabbitt: it's a simple variable, not an element
[10:27:13] <TehRabbitt> ah
[10:27:35] <TehRabbitt> thats what I was stuck on :-\ for some reason I guess I thought I still needed .val() when dealing with it
[10:27:40] <mordof> TehRabbitt: it's a data type for javascript, that's why the link i kept referring you to will help you. It will help you distinguish data types and how they should be used
[10:27:54] <mordof> TehRabbitt: you won't get confused after reading that link with things like this
[10:28:26] <mordof> TehRabbitt: .val() is a jquery method used to retrieve certain data sets from different elements, it has no part in javascript variables
[10:29:02] <Taloncor1> lisak: your second example works as well ;-)
[10:29:14] <overthemike> mordof: you're everywhere
[10:29:21] <mordof> overthemike: lol, yeah
[10:29:21] <TehRabbitt> lol
[10:29:43] <TehRabbitt> mordof: yea now i've just gotta figure out why it's still not being brought over... sigh hopefully i can figure this out soon
[10:29:48] <mordof> overthemike: i tend to hang out in any number of about 10-15 different channels
[10:29:55] <overthemike> jeez
[10:29:59] <overthemike> I couldn't keep track
[10:30:00] <mordof> TehRabbitt: pastebin your code pertaining to the problem please
[10:30:13] <mordof> overthemike: it helps when you've used IRC for most of your life, lol
[10:30:26] <overthemike> mordof: I can imagine
[10:30:29] <TehRabbitt> mordof: it's litterely 		var totItem = Brand.val() + ' ' + Model.val();
[10:30:29] <TehRabbitt> and then alert(totItem);
[10:30:31] <mordof> TehRabbitt: i'll take a look at it and see if i can help you distinguish what's going wrong
[10:30:36] <TehRabbitt> it only shows the first half of it
[10:30:44] <mordof> TehRabbitt: right, but I'd like to see the surrounding code to go with it
[10:31:16] <mordof> TehRabbitt: often times surrounding code can cause problems that you may not be aware of
[10:31:17] <overthemike> TehRabbit: what are Brand and Model?
[10:31:27] <mordof> overthemike: input elements, a select and an input respectively
[10:31:32] <mordof> or the other way around?
[10:31:36] <TehRabbitt> http://paste.debian.net/152043/
[10:31:42] <TehRabbitt> mordof: very true
[10:32:17] <mordof> TehRabbitt: you can just use #manufacturer, and #modelNumber..?
[10:32:19] <overthemike> TehRabbit: why are you using id*=?
[10:32:22] <mordof> instead of doing that.. yeah
[10:32:34] <TehRabbitt> like I know that the variables are passed into it from the form properly, because it prints the label fine, but for "design reasons"  I need to combine all the info ont one line
[10:32:49] <TehRabbitt> overthemike: because of a HUGE headache from a few weeks ago
[10:32:55] <TehRabbitt> id's are not the same on every page
[10:32:56] <t4nkd> After I append stuff to an element, is there a simple(built in?) way to focus the viewport on that new element?
[10:33:00] <TehRabbitt> only part of them are
[10:33:21] <TehRabbitt> I can't modifiy the other part of it, (sadly)
[10:33:23] <overthemike> t4nkd: .focus()
[10:33:28] <t4nkd> awesome, ty :)
[10:33:28] <mordof> t4nkd: yeah, i think it's ju... just that .. lol
[10:33:39] <mordof> overthemike: ;p
[10:33:51] <overthemike> they call me....quick draw
[10:34:02] <TehRabbitt> overthemike: the IDs coming in from the actual page show up something like..... auditLaptop:modelNumber  or auditPrinter:modelNumber
[10:34:02] <t4nkd> I figured there was, just, asking 'jquery focus element in viewport' yielded some fun results :P
[10:34:11] <t4nkd> tyty again
[10:34:12] <mordof> TehRabbitt: you've got an elaborate onload, with jquery all you really need to do is $(function(){  // put code in here }); and it will get run onload
[10:34:22] <jgornick> Hey guys, is it possible to listen for an event when the data of an element is modified? In IE8, it seems that one of my elements is randomly losing it's data and I'm trying to diagnose why it's happening.
[10:34:24] <overthemike> ok
[10:34:36] <mordof> jgornick: onchange
[10:34:50] <jgornick> mordof: for jQuery's data?
[10:34:56] <TehRabbitt> mordof: I tried that a while back, it didn't work right with the dymo API / couldn't get it working correctly :-\
[10:35:00] <webPragmatist> question...
[10:35:04] <theBrettman> can anyone tell me why this script don't work? http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/LKqVs/
[10:35:13] <aximilation> 'cause it's broken
[10:35:14] <mordof> jgornick: "jQuery's data"? what exactly are you referring to?
[10:35:22] <mordof> jgornick: jguery doesn't store data for elements
[10:35:28] <overthemike> TehRabbit: try setting a default value for the vars and see if they're just not coming back with something....
[10:35:29] <overthemike> like
[10:35:32] <jgornick> $('.el').data('test', true)
[10:35:40] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: this is not a jquery object. $(this) is
[10:35:48] <overthemike> var ModelVal = Model.val() || "Model value doesn't exist";
[10:35:56] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: and are you meaning to make selectedElement a global variable?
[10:35:59] <webPragmatist> I have a json object something like http://pastie.textmate.org/private/ufnmauuxo6mpuxqluoakgq how can I stuff a \n character after each error?
[10:36:06] <webPragmatist> i'm guessing something like .join ?
[10:36:10] <theBrettman> thx eddie
[10:36:19] <theBrettman> no, I want it to change everytime you click an element
[10:36:21] <mordof> jgornick: oh, that's entirely different
[10:36:25] <jgornick> :)
[10:36:25] <theBrettman> it's an ide
[10:36:30] <TehRabbitt> overthemike: well I know Model.val() is there, because if I purt an alert in right before the alert(totItem); for both Model.val() and Brand.val() it shows the values for both
[10:36:37] <mordof> jgornick: that's a property of an element
[10:36:38] <eddiemonge> webPragmatist: do it when processing the json
[10:36:51] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: then you need a var before it
[10:37:10] <overthemike> and totItem is showing what now?
[10:37:12] <mordof> jgornick: and no, to my knowledge there is no browser event hooked to property changes
[10:37:20] <mordof> jgornick: you could write your own getter/setter to do so though
[10:37:25] <webPragmatist> eddiemonge: what do you mean? I data from a json request
[10:37:30] <mordof> jgornick: but you'd need to do it without jquery
[10:37:30] <whoever_> i have to js files bothe wraped with document.ready, how ever the first file when i add the file to my page it causes  a button to not work from a mobile device(will work from desktop) , and when i exclude the first file the button will work on a mobile device. i have tried just commending inside the first file except the doucument.ready and I still have the same problem. any ideas
[10:37:30] <webPragmatist> have *
[10:37:37] <TehRabbitt> it shows "DELL"
[10:37:44] <TehRabbitt> well
[10:37:52] <TehRabbitt> model shows "DELL" the other two are being left blank
[10:37:52] <TehRabbitt> hm
[10:37:57] <TehRabbitt> I think I broke something
[10:38:01] <overthemike> two?
[10:38:09] <mordof> TehRabbitt: are you sure that the elements are being retrieved properly?
[10:38:22] <TehRabbitt> mordof: they were... like I said, I think i broke something somehow
[10:38:27] <mordof> TehRabbitt: heh..
[10:38:31] <theBrettman> ok, still don't work http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/LKqVs/
[10:38:40] <mordof> TehRabbitt: care to make your code into a jsfiddle?
[10:38:41] <TehRabbitt> mordof: I'm going to roll back the code to step one and try readding that line, brb
[10:38:51] <TehRabbitt> mordof: can't really, it's half javascript, half JSP
[10:38:59] <overthemike> theBrettman: change "this" to $(this)
[10:38:59] <mordof> TehRabbitt: then use the output
[10:39:02] <TehRabbitt> hm
[10:39:11] <mordof> TehRabbitt: you don't need it to be *exact*
[10:39:18] <mordof> TehRabbitt: just try and recreate it in a fiddle, a small portion of it
[10:39:20] <mordof> TehRabbitt: test case
[10:39:21] <overthemike> theBrettman: and use the variable to set the css stuff
[10:39:22] <TehRabbitt> I can pastebin the view source of the other side of it, but not sure how to get jsfiddle working right
[10:39:44] <overthemike> theBrettman: this doesn't refer to the element, it refers to the jquery object...
[10:39:50] <mordof> TehRabbitt: jsfiddle uses HTML, and Javascript panels - simply select the onLoad from the right (and leave out ALL of your onload code) and put your javascript in there
[10:39:52] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: look at the console and run jslint
[10:39:55] <TehRabbitt> http://paste.debian.net/152046/
[10:39:57] <mordof> from the left panel***
[10:40:17] <eddiemonge> overthemike: you have the backwards cc: theBrettman
[10:40:56] <overthemike> eddiemonge: what do you mean?
[10:41:20] <mordof> whoever_: it's hard to say what the problem is without seeing a pastebin of code
[10:41:25] <mordof> whoever_: can you make a small test case?
[10:41:39] <eddiemonge> in the function, this refers to the dom element and $(this) refers to the jquery rep of that element
[10:41:43] <Eviltwin> mordof: It might be helpful to tell people to see ?cik
[10:41:43] <bot-t> mordof, Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[10:42:12] <mordof> Eviltwin: ah, i don't know the bot here at all :) thanks
[10:42:19] <eddiemonge> whoever_: are you still using jquery mobile?
[10:42:24] <TehRabbitt> brb i've gotta fix this :-\
[10:42:35] <Eviltwin> mordof: Well I at least know the ones I programmed :P
[10:42:39] <alexr2> aaanyone with the dynamic script loading deal? http://pastebin.com/9erYQciK
[10:42:41] <mordof> Eviltwin: heh, handy :)
[10:42:42] <theBrettman> oh duh, I had a syntax error at the end, lol
[10:42:59] <overthemike> eddiemonge: thx
[10:43:06] <mordof> anyhow! back to work I go!! *idles*
[10:43:11] <whoever_> eddiemonge: ya, jqm framework
[10:43:17] <mordof> overthemike: if you need me send me a message, i'll check from time to time
[10:43:40] <overthemike> mordof: ok
[10:44:12] <eddiemonge> whoever_: then .ready() is not what you want. since it isnt the same for mobile
[10:44:53] <lisak> Taloncor1, if I hit run
[10:45:00] <lisak> http://jsfiddle.net/CPDH4/2/
[10:45:06] <lisak> the html doesn't change
[10:45:53] <mantas322> im looking for some autocomplete functionality which takes a comma deliminated list
[10:46:08] <mantas322> i tryed the "chosen" but its not really what im looking for
[10:46:14] <Taloncor1> lisak: The part in the HTML-Box never changes
[10:46:32] <mantas322> any one know where to fidn some examples of either autocomplete being populated from a database or some type of file
[10:46:34] <Taloncor1> lisak: You have to examine the result field (with Firebug or a similiar tool)
[10:46:45] <mordof> lisak: http://jsfiddle.net/CPDH4/4/
[10:46:46] <mantas322> any recommendations would be greatly appreciated ;)
[10:47:01] <overthemike> mantas322: I've got a few things like that, but they're not super easy...
[10:47:10] <mordof> i don't know why people use .find() so often..
[10:47:17] <mordof> there's zero point, lol
[10:47:18] <overthemike> mantas322: but I can help point you in the right direction
[10:47:22] <mantas322> okay
[10:47:30] <mordof> in that context anyway
[10:47:33] <mantas322> first is your thing a database call or some sort of hardcoded file?
[10:47:33] <overthemike> mordof: .find() isn't so bad
[10:47:34] <Chopps> lisak the field type is hidden, u will not be able to see it
[10:47:42] <mordof> overthemike: no, it's very handy when used the way it's intended
[10:47:46] <mantas322> btw I have like 5000 elements
[10:47:48] <eddiemonge> mordof: zero point if you dont like performance
[10:47:54] <overthemike> mantas322: it can be
[10:48:04] <mantas322> so it might be better to use ajax somehow to return
[10:48:07] <mantas322> I donno
[10:48:15] <mordof> eddiemonge: how is $("#id").find(".childclass") any better than $("#id .childclass")?
[10:48:19] <mantas322> I'm going to on the side look into some solutions here for the next two days
[10:48:21] <eddiemonge> mordof: this is what your paste should be: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/CPDH4/6/
[10:48:32] <eddiemonge> mordof: its a lot better.
[10:48:35] <eddiemonge> a loooot
[10:48:45] <Eviltwin> mordof: Trust the experts
[10:48:46] <lisak> Chopps, I don't see it even if it is not
[10:49:03] <eddiemonge> $('#id') calls getEleById instead of going through sizzle or other things making it super fast
[10:49:04] <lisak> http://jsfiddle.net/CPDH4/7/
[10:49:12] <mordof> ahh
[10:49:20] <eddiemonge> lisak: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/CPDH4/6/
[10:49:29] <eddiemonge> the .each isnt necessary either
[10:49:38] <mordof> but still, the .find() sure does the same thing?
[10:49:42] <mordof> surely*
[10:49:44] <eddiemonge> otherwise you are calling .each twice
[10:49:51] <Chopps> lisak maybe because its inside the div and the div is set to display none
[10:49:53] <overthemike> eddiemonge: $("#id") does a little more than just call getElById - my fav is just doing $(document.getElementByid('id'))
[10:49:57] <eddiemonge> mordof: the .find() will operate only on the id
[10:50:15] <TagAholic> can i use query to modify text as it is being pulled from a database but before it is sent out to the browser?
[10:50:16] <mordof> eddiemonge: so will the first case
[10:50:17] <eddiemonge> overthemike: true, but then you have a lot more code to maintain
[10:50:31] <overthemike> eddiemonge: not really, should be caching that stuff anyway
[10:50:31] <eddiemonge> mordof: nope. jsperf.com it. trust me on this
[10:50:36] <TehRabbitt> okay back
[10:50:39] <TagAholic> the information is being pulled from a sql database using php
[10:50:41] <eddiemonge> overthemike: might as well get rid of jquery too then
[10:50:51] <lisak> ok, thanks
[10:51:18] <Eviltwin> overthemike: It pretty much does a regex or two then document.getElementById
[10:51:36] <mordof> eddiemonge: so $('input', $('#id')) would be similar to using the .find()?
[10:51:46] <overthemike> eddiemonge: I disagree, just simply doing a $(document.getElementById()) instead of $("#id") is like 4x faster, and you still have the benefits of it being a jquery object
[10:51:52] <Eviltwin> It's find plus an extra $() and extra function call
[10:52:06] <mordof> Eviltwin: right
[10:52:12] <mordof> i mean similar in concept
[10:52:14] <whoever_> eddiemonge: it isn't but .ready will still execute , and if building a true mobile site it would be page init,   so far it looks like by chaging element.hide() to (element).css("visibility","visible:hidden") seem to have solved it so far
[10:52:19] <eddiemonge> mordof: similar but slower
[10:52:26] <mordof> mhmm
[10:52:38] <mordof> is there a jsperf already made for testing that previous case? i am curious
[10:52:43] <mordof> or do i need to make my own
[10:52:44] <eddiemonge> overthemike: like i said, its more code to maintain and its not 4x faster
[10:53:18] <eddiemonge> mordof: there is. ive made a bunch
[10:53:44] <overthemike> eddiemonge: try jsperfing it, and it's not that much more if you're not continually querying the dom instead of caching the objects
[10:53:45] <mordof> heh, checking your latest one xD
[10:53:58] <mordof> eddiemonge: it is 4x faster on my comp
[10:54:08] <whoever_> eddiemonge: and for what its worth you where right .click doesn't really work  on mobile but .bind("click",function(){}) does
[10:54:15] <illmatix> Is there a good method of scrolling along a path and creating it?
[10:54:32] <overthemike> whoever_: .click should work, but it has a delay
[10:54:35] <Eviltwin> The thing to understand is that both $("#id") and $(document.getElementById("id")) are still a lot faster than most operations
[10:54:37] <mordof> overthemike: interesting
[10:54:38] <Eviltwin> http://jsperf.com/jquery-vs-getelementbyid-2
[10:54:45] <eddiemonge> mordof: look at http://addyosmani.com/blog/jquery-proven-performance-tips-tricks-slides/
[10:54:57] <overthemike> whoever_: there's an event called touchstart that might be what you're looking for
[10:55:11] <mordof> Eviltwin: oh, you created that? lol - i already ran it
[10:55:45] <whoever_> overthemike: well the delay must be extreeemly long, i never got it to work without .bind
[10:56:02] <overthemike> whoever_: yeah with mobile stuff, it's not great
[10:56:18] <TehRabbitt> okay, so this works, in jfiddle, but not on my page :-\
[10:56:18] <TehRabbitt> http://jsfiddle.net/za88W/
[10:56:24] <overthemike> .click() is just a shortcut to .bind('click') though
[10:56:44] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge, overthemike: http://jsperf.com/jquery-vs-getelementbyid-2/2
[10:56:50] <mordof> TehRabbitt: so make a copy of the pages in=volved, and start trimming them down until it works
[10:56:58] <eddiemonge> overthemike: now its a shortcut for .on("click")
[10:57:15] <Eviltwin> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl's_law
[10:57:21] <overthemike> whoever_: what :eddiemonge said
[10:57:22] <eddiemonge> TehRabbitt: you need quotes around modelNumber
[10:57:27] <Eviltwin> Optimize the big stuff first :P
[10:57:59] <overthemike> Evitwin: agreed
[10:58:10] <mordof> heh, my optimize the big stuff = don't use jquery
[10:58:21] <mordof> when i need something performance intensive i drop jquery
[10:58:29] <overthemike> mordof: haha
[10:58:40] <Eviltwin> mordof: No, if you need something performance, drop fucking JavaScript
[10:58:57] <overthemike> Eviltwin: eh?
[10:58:58] <mordof> Eviltwin: actually I wrote a brian's brain implementation that kept up with Haskell fully optimized :)
[10:59:10] <mordof> Eviltwin: javascript is slower yes, but it's not like it's a snail
[10:59:19] <Eviltwin> In the realm of JavaScript, jQuery is a thin layer of overhead
[10:59:22] <overthemike> Eviltwin: don't knock the js :P
[10:59:24] <mordof> o.o
[10:59:45] <eddiemonge> mordof: perhaps instead of dropping jquery, you should learn the best practices of it
[11:00:02] <theBrettman> ok. I got no errors but it don't work: http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/LKqVs/12/
[11:00:06] <overthemike> eddiemonge: best practices are a lot of times subjective
[11:00:11] <Eviltwin> Now if you go doing stuff like $("body [href*=foo]")
[11:00:14] <Eviltwin> That's your own damn fault
[11:00:20] <mordof> Eviltwin: lol, true that
[11:00:41] <mordof> no, i mean indexing 500,000 elements and having a mouseover for checking all of them take less than 2ms
[11:01:06] <mordof> i don't care how much you use 'best practices' in jquery, i'd like to see someone use jquery for that
[11:01:22] <lilmikey> hi
[11:01:36] <lilmikey> what event happens before (document).ready?
[11:01:38] <eddiemonge> mordof: cant do it in pure js either
[11:01:42] <mordof> eddiemonge: i have
[11:01:54] <mordof> eddiemonge: it's entirely possible, faster as well
[11:01:59] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ mordof :P
[11:02:01] <bot-t> Eviltwin, Creating a Secure Login System the Right Way | Tinsology - http://tinsology.net/2009/06/creating-a-secure-login-system-the-right-way/
[11:02:03] <mordof> eddiemonge: we slowed it down because the insert to the index was slower
[11:02:04] <eddiemonge> impossible. especially since the smallest time in js is about 4 ms
[11:02:11] <mordof> eddiemonge: rofl
[11:02:13] <lilmikey> I would like to hide all the elements and then fade them in -> but need them to hide before they load :)
[11:02:24] <MagePsycho> guys, i would like to have one suggestion, how to add hidden field with the value when custom div  boxes  are clicked
[11:02:33] <MagePsycho> for example: http://www.panzit.com/dynamic-bearing
[11:02:43] <mordof> Eviltwin: a project a person and I worked on a while back, check github for Rtree - the example code is broken because we did an update and then the project kinda fizzled
[11:02:46] <Eviltwin> mordof: Can you make a jsPerf showing what you were talking about
[11:02:52] <Eviltwin> In terms of performance
[11:02:57] <theBrettman> can anyone tell me why this won't work? http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/LKqVs/12/
[11:03:01] <mordof> Eviltwin: not quickly
[11:03:07] <mordof> Eviltwin: we used the firebug profiler
[11:03:48] <overthemike> theBrettman: you've lost scope on selectedElement
[11:03:56] <mordof> if you're dead set on seeing it though, msg me your emails and i'll email you when I get a chance to put a jsperf of it together
[11:04:04] <theBrettman> well how do I keep scope?
[11:04:06] <overthemike> you need to define selectedElement outside of the canvas click ecent
[11:04:07] <overthemike> event*
[11:04:26] <theBrettman> ok, so I cna just move that line?
[11:04:30] <overthemike> yeah
[11:04:39] <overthemike> well
[11:04:39] <overthemike> no
[11:04:49] <overthemike> but kind of
[11:05:05] <alexr2> move var selectedElement out... and then do selectedElement=$(this) inside of it
[11:05:39] <theBrettman> I tried that once but it didn't work in the next function still
[11:05:50] <snagnever> hey! how can i get the *actual* width of an element if it wasnt limited by css?
[11:05:56] <overthemike> theBrettman: http://pastebin.com/vgVPJQEu
[11:05:58] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/LKqVs/13/
[11:06:00] <mordof> snagnever: ele.clientWidth
[11:06:10] <mordof> or i think $(ele).width() for jquery
[11:06:35] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: you dont need to define that element as a var unless you need it else where
[11:06:42] <snagnever> mordof let me check, thx ;]
[11:06:57] <overthemike> eddiemonge: he is using it elsewhere
[11:07:02] <overthemike> he's using 3 times
[11:07:09] <MagePsycho> any idea on makiing div box as hidden fields
[11:07:26] <MagePsycho> so that on clickiing on that box triggers the hidden field form value
[11:07:46] <Zzaichik> selectedElement always = #canvas?
[11:07:52] <eddiemonge> overthemike: but if its only for the given examples, its not really needed
[11:07:54] <theBrettman> I do wanna use it elsewhere
[11:08:03] <lilmikey> is there a way to hide body before it loads?
[11:08:08] <theBrettman> after I make that div, I wanna put a div inside it, and another in it...
[11:08:17] <overthemike> eddiemonge: for the given examples, he's using it 3 times
[11:08:22] <theBrettman> I want to be able to select whatever element and add a div to it
[11:09:11] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: since you are using ids, there will only be one element. if it was on classes and there were more elements that would be different
[11:09:34] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: so you want to put divs in the divs and not in the #canvas element?
[11:09:56] <snagnever> mordof not that =/
[11:10:16] <theBrettman> well, I have to put div's in the canvas and inside those divs
[11:10:26] <theBrettman> so that's why I want to grab this
[11:10:45] <theBrettman> that way, I can select an element to append to
[11:11:07] <snagnever> i mean, i have <div><ul></ul></div> . the parent div is limited to width:200px; the ul has some elements that overflow, so they are dropped to the following line. i want to expand the DIV width so it doesnt overflow
[11:11:22] <snagnever> the same effect as width:auto -- but it doesnt work when animating
[11:11:48] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: ok then the code you have wont do that
[11:12:02] <theBrettman> obv... but idk how to do it, lol
[11:12:12] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: explain what needs to happen exactly
[11:12:18] <theBrettman> it's an ide
[11:12:37] <theBrettman> I wanna add divs to the canvas, and divs to those divs
[11:12:42] <theBrettman> and set their properties...
[11:12:47] <theBrettman> for template design
[11:13:53] <theBrettman> so when an element is selected, I can also change its properties...
[11:14:23] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: oh. you need to delegate the click
[11:14:38] <theBrettman> on does delegate
[11:15:02] <Eviltwin> How are you doing the .on?
[11:15:04] <eddiemonge> not the way you have it http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/LKqVs/14/
[11:15:50] <theBrettman> but there will be more than div's later
[11:15:56] <theBrettman> I wanna use any element
[11:16:09] <eddiemonge> then change the 'div' to * in the .on
[11:16:32] <Eviltwin> Wait...
[11:16:35] <theBrettman> and I still gotta use the variable so I can do stuff to it later
[11:16:43] <theBrettman> I don't want to only append to the canvas
[11:16:57] <theBrettman> I want to append to whatever element is selected
[11:17:12] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: why are you trying to make your own editor?
[11:17:34] <Eviltwin> theBrettman: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[11:17:55] <theBrettman> for a wordpress theme that lets you make your own theme. I'm also going to let people append widget areas
[11:18:29] <theBrettman> one of these days, it will be a full blown ide of mass proportions, lol
[11:18:31] <TehRabbitt> okay heres a quick question, any way to prevent variables from showing up "undefined" when i'm combining them?  this is what I've tried, but if the variable isn't set, it just appends "undefined" to the string: 		var driveList = HDD.val() + ' ' + HDD1.val() || ' ' + ' ' + HDD2.val() || ' ' + ' ' + HDD3.val() || ' ' + ' ' + HDD4.val() || ' ';
[11:18:48] <TehRabbitt> i've got everything else workign perfectly now :-D cept' for that lol
[11:18:52] <Eviltwin> TehRabbitt: Try using ()'s
[11:19:06] <TehRabbitt> ah, so just () around each part?
[11:19:06] <Eviltwin> (HDD.val() || ' ') + ...
[11:19:10] <Eviltwin> Around each ||
[11:19:11] <TehRabbitt> got it :-D
[11:19:12] <Eviltwin> Thingy
[11:19:15] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: i was asking is because there are a lot of these types of editors you could try using
[11:19:21] <theBrettman> another thing is, I only want items inside the canvas to be selected
[11:19:45] <theBrettman> yeah, I know. but there's not an editor that can work in wordpress like this and it would make life so much easier
[11:20:02] <theBrettman> ha, my dad was a tool maker. now I'm making my own tools too, lol
[11:20:43] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin: so this should work then? var driveList = (HDD.val() + ' ' || ' ') + (HDD1.val() + ' ' || ' ') + (HDD2.val() + ' ' || ' ') + (HDD3.val() + ' ' || ' ') + (HDD4.val() + ' ' || ' ');
[11:20:56] <gfredericks> Am I wrong for expecting this to be meaningful? $("<option>foo</option>").is("[value]")
[11:21:04] <TehRabbitt> nope :-\
[11:21:12] <TehRabbitt> still "undefined undefined undefined undefined"
[11:21:21] <Eviltwin> Well duh
[11:21:28] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: tinyMCE doesnt do what you want?
[11:21:34] <Eviltwin> Take a close look at (HDD.val() + ' ' || ' ')
[11:21:37] <TehRabbitt> oh wait I put the || in the wrong spot didnt I
[11:21:38] <TehRabbitt> lol
[11:21:57] <Eviltwin> I suggest (HDD.val() || '') + ' ' + (HDD1.val() || '') + ...
[11:22:08] <TehRabbitt> ah
[11:22:17] <theBrettman> no, tinyMCE is a pain
[11:22:22] <theBrettman> but this is for the template
[11:22:32] <theBrettman> the tinyMCE in wordpress is for posts
[11:22:44] <sphinxxx> any idea why a scrollable div doesn't scroll inside a lightbox/fancybox
[11:22:59] <theBrettman> I want to make templates from mockups faster by making a structure and adding widget areas
[11:23:00] <sphinxxx> i have a div inside the fancybox, with overflow-y:scroll
[11:23:08] <theBrettman> then I'll design my own modifiable widget areas too
[11:23:26] <theBrettman> that way, someone can just go click crazy to make a fast site exactly how they want it
[11:23:44] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin: w00t it worked :-D
[11:24:49] <theBrettman> and I'm gonna have a gui for the properties
[11:25:03] <theBrettman> I actually want them to save on the stylesheet but I'll work on that later
[11:26:52] <gfredericks> it is false in chrome and true in IE
[11:27:38] <NoiseEee> gfredericks: i can't imagine what you think that line should be doing
[11:27:59] <EAN407> http://jsfiddle.net/4yE8S/ . if i drag&drop the pictures and try to drag it 500 ms or 1 seconds after the drop the image gets marked and not moved
[11:28:01] <gfredericks> NoiseEee: I'd like to tell if the <option> tag has a value attribute
[11:28:15] <gfredericks> NoiseEee: as distinguished from its value being inferred from its text
[11:28:24] <rockitss> hi, why this is only working in the second time ? http://jsfiddle.net/yL4MV/
[11:28:50] <gfredericks> NoiseEee: using this selector: http://api.jquery.com/has-attribute-selector/
[11:28:57] <mantas322> lol
[11:29:05] <mantas322> my app freezes browsers
[11:29:30] <NoiseEee> gfredericks: i'd ask for .attr('value') personally
[11:29:44] <NoiseEee> gfredericks: i assume thats academic as you're inquiring about an element you're actually creating?
[11:30:19] <gfredericks> NoiseEee: well yes but it'd be cleaner if I could figure it out without help
[11:30:34] <gfredericks> .attr('value') actually returns the text in both chrome and IE
[11:32:32] <bribroder> hey guys, you know how after you submit a google form it pops up another window with a trivial "thanks!" formResponse? e.g.: http://goo.gl/ms7JO
[11:32:44] <bribroder> any ideas on suppressing it?
[11:38:06] <someprimetime> rockitss: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/yL4MV/3/
[11:38:53] <rockitss> ty primetime but this is now only working at the first time
[11:39:15] <someprimetime> you should look into toggle() to re-register to event handler and use jquery() since, after all this is a #jquery channel
[11:40:09] <someprimetime> ?.toggle @ rockitss
[11:40:10] <bot-t> rockitss, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[11:41:02] <rockitss> ahh ok thanks
[11:42:18] <anoob> how do i select an select option where label == something?
[11:42:31] <anoob> i would like to do it with parent.find ...
[11:44:19] <Meshach> Is .delay() the setTimeOut equivalent?
[11:44:29] <Eviltwin> ?jsisjs @ Meshach
[11:44:30] <bot-t> Meshach, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[11:44:38] <Eviltwin> And if you see ?.delay
[11:44:38] <bot-t> .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[11:44:46] <Eviltwin> It explains that it's not a setTimeout replacement
[11:44:49] <Eviltwin> And is for use in animations
[11:45:02] <Meshach> Copy that, thanks. Great support.
[11:46:56] <NoiseEee> gfredericks: yeah i guess thats a bug in IE, not sure if thats a jquery-solvable bug in IE, you might want to try going native JS and hasAttribute('value')
[11:47:56] <someprimetime> hey Eviltwin when you used $cur = this within that $.fn.prevLoop function to help me with that carousel I was building, that is to keep it within the current prevLoop function's namespace, right?
[11:48:07] <someprimetime> (using $ that is instead of just var cur = this;
[11:48:12] <someprimetime> )
[11:48:56] <Eviltwin> The real reason was that I was going to be iterating over each previous element
[11:48:59] <Eviltwin> So I needed a variable of some kind
[11:49:14] <Eviltwin> You can't set "this"
[11:49:37] <someprimetime> ok, but why prefix with $?
[11:49:47] <Eviltwin> Oh, no reason
[11:50:04] <mantas322> u know why
[11:50:05] <Eviltwin> Some people like to use it to distinguish between functions and variables
[11:50:10] <Eviltwin> Others use it when it's a jQuery collection
[11:51:50] <EAN407> http://jsfiddle.net/4yE8S/ . if i drag&drop the pictures and try to drag it 500 ms or 1 seconds after the drop the image gets marked and not moved. anyone got a clue what could cause this?
[11:57:40] <rockitss> http://jsfiddle.net/yL4MV/4/ cant solve my problem with toggle, do i need 2 buttons?
[12:03:09] <mantas322> why doesnt jQuery   like    window.location = "http://
[12:03:12] <mantas322> WHAT THE GUFF!
[12:03:30] <Eviltwin> Well it's usually a good idea to close quotes
[12:03:40] <mantas322> im remaining anonymous
[12:03:51] <mantas322> is there an equivelent to that>?
[12:03:54] <mantas322> for jQuery?
[12:04:26] <Eviltwin> What?
[12:08:20] <gar_onn> Hey, looking for an event to bind on if the dom of an elment changes,
[12:10:23] <gar_onn> mantas322, what about http://api.jquery.com/children/ , but why not just use >*
[12:10:24] <gar_onn> ?
[12:11:00] <mantas322> not sure what that is
[12:11:09] <mantas322> wait
[12:11:19] <mantas322> am i not allowed to use regular javascript if im usng jQuery?
[12:11:27] <mantas322> cause that could be causing all this madness im seeing here
[12:11:56] <mantas322> no
[12:12:00] <mantas322> no
[12:12:13] <Eviltwin> ?jsisjs
[12:12:14] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[12:12:15] <gar_onn> you can use all CSS selectors

[12:12:48] <gar_onn> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[12:14:20] <LordThumper> Is there some .js library that contains missing functions such as Array.indexOf() in IE8?
[12:14:49] <raygerrard> what
[12:15:24] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: That one can be done via $.inArray
[12:15:50] <Eviltwin> I generally consider it a bad practice to modify the native prototypes
[12:15:58] <LordThumper> Eviltwin: I know, prefer not having to change code,
[12:16:35] <mantas322> omg ...Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[12:16:39] <LordThumper> Eviltwin: Found a function that adds Array.prototype.indexOf when it is not defined
[12:16:47] <rknLA> mantas322: stop breaking the law!
[12:16:52] <LordThumper> I think it is better that way for now
[12:16:54] <Eviltwin> Right, modifies the native Array prototype
[12:17:13] <LordThumper> Does it make sense?
[12:17:39] <LordThumper> Ok seems working
[12:18:43] <mantas322> also
[12:18:47] <mantas322> I have this button
[12:18:53] <mantas322> <input type="submit"
[12:19:06] <mantas322> onClick goes to a function that does absolutely nothing
[12:19:10] <mantas322> and yet my page refreshes
[12:19:32] <LordThumper> Coded some functions yesterday, just now noticed that some functionality was broken in IE8
[12:19:36] <kborchers> ?preventDefault @ mantas322
[12:19:37] <bot-t> mantas322, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[12:19:37] <NoiseEee> mantas322: you want to stop the submit event of the form, not anything related to a button you click
[12:19:51] <Eviltwin> mantas322: Sounds like you need to learn JavaScript
[12:19:57] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ mantas322
[12:19:57] <mantas322> sounds like SHUT UP!
[12:19:58] <bot-t> mantas322, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[12:20:05] <NoiseEee> sounds like 'goodbye'
[12:20:57] <mantas322> hey hey
[12:20:59] <mantas322> success
[12:21:09] <mantas322> thanks kborchers and noiseEee
[12:21:14] <LordThumper> Or use <input type="button
[12:21:23] <LordThumper> "
[12:21:49] <NoiseEee> LordThumper: always put it on the form itself, you don't know how anyone might be submitting it (pressing enter, for example),,, its the form that counts, not what submits it
[12:21:50] <LordThumper> Don't think it posts that way...
[12:22:42] <mantas322> event.preventDefault();    cheered me up a little i guess
[12:22:49] <LordThumper> NoiseEee, just from personal experience, don't want to imply anything
[12:23:08] <LordThumper> <asp:Button> renders to <input type="submit"> which is not always desired
[12:23:19] <LordThumper> Sorry Asp.net jargon...
[12:23:25] <badbandit> hey there, anyone familiar with the jquery lightbox called colorbox? I have a question - I have an anchor on my page that points to a survey on external site, I load it with colorbox in an iframe, is there anyway to add some html to be placed on top of the loaded iframe??
[12:23:37] <badbandit> aka so I can add a title to the iframe pertaining to where it came from on my own site
[12:25:43] <LordThumper> badandit: Why don't you add text to a div in the iframe using $(element).text() for example?
[12:26:04] <LordThumper> After the lightbox opens
[12:26:48] <mantas322> appearently jQuery has issues with my localStorage actions
[12:26:49] <LordThumper> I think that is the only solution, don't think you can mix in-line with iframe
[12:26:51] <badbandit> I see, so do something like onComplete: function() { add some stuff } ..?
[12:26:58] <LordThumper> yes
[12:27:06] <badbandit> ok sweet let me try that thanks!
[12:27:27] <LordThumper> onComplete:function() { $("#div").text("Title") }
[12:29:05] <badbandit> wait how do you add the div though
[12:29:17] <badbandit> or do I have to inject a div with text
[12:29:34] <alexr2> other than less text, is there any advantage speedwise to running getscript() vs aja()?
[12:29:37] <alexr2> ajax*
[12:29:58] <Eviltwin> alexr2: getScript calls ajax with the right parameters
[12:30:07] <alexr2> so getscript is actually slower?
[12:30:15] <Eviltwin> By a function call, yes
[12:30:36] <LordThumper> badbandit: You can create a div yourself, but I don't know the exact code
[12:30:42] <alexr2> okay, thanks
[12:30:46] <badbandit> ok
[12:30:52] <badbandit> found a stackover flow that I think shows how to do it
[12:30:56] <LordThumper> Something like $("<div id="foo"></div>").append("elementonthesurvey")
[12:30:59] <badbandit> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4589733/jquery-colorbox-iframe-and-selector
[12:31:21] <LordThumper> Wait vice-versa
[12:31:44] <alexr2> or appendTo :-P
[12:32:11] <LordThumper> Yeah :)
[12:32:26] <mantas322> No :(
[12:33:44] <LordThumper> badbandit: Do you have a link to this survey?
[12:34:15] <badbandit> www.utsandiego.com, bottom right corner
[12:34:59] <mantas322> what is illegal about this????????? if (typeof(localStorage) == 'undefined' )
[12:35:06] <LordThumper> Don't see anything
[12:35:07] <mantas322> i am so MAD >:O
[12:35:12] <alexr2> typeof localStorage == 'undefined'
[12:35:34] <alexr2> not typeof(localStorage)
[12:35:43] <mantas322> ?
[12:35:50] <alexr2> no parentheses
[12:36:20] <a_s> if i put $(document).ready(function () {} in a .js file and include that in a .html file with <script src= .. that will be executed right?
[12:36:30] <mantas322> still illegal
[12:36:51] <a_s> ?
[12:36:55] <Eviltwin> a_s: Yes
[12:37:01] <alexr2> what error are you getting? mantas322?
[12:37:05] <a_s> Eviltwin, thanks, i must be doing something else wrong
[12:37:08] <mantas322> illegal token
[12:37:17] <alexr2> what is localStorage?
[12:37:32] <mantas322> html5 local storage
[12:37:41] <mantas322> and another part is cache manifest
[12:37:57] <mantas322> these are new html5 thingies that allow you to SAVE to the users browser
[12:38:29] <mantas322> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[12:39:09] <LordThumper> Eviltwin: Recently I upgraded jQuery from 1.3.x or so to 1.7.1. Chrome was nagging me with "Support for event.layerX and event.layerY will be deprecated in Webkit", which seems to be fixed now. However I now have some trouble interacting with some divs that are situated under other divs. Is this related?
[12:39:29] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: I...don't think so
[12:39:35] <LordThumper> Oh ok
[12:39:52] <alexr2> mantas322, can you show me some code... if i just type it onto the chrome console typeof localStorage gives me "object" without any issue
[12:41:14] <mantas322> wtf
[12:41:17] <mantas322> now it works
[12:41:23] <mantas322> this is some voodoo going on here
[12:41:25] <alexr2> haha
[12:41:33] <Eviltwin> mantas322: It's caled "caching"
[12:41:35] <mantas322> maybe theres another developer picking away at my js file or something
[12:41:54] <mantas322> no no  I crtl shift delete all my cache
[12:44:26] <LordThumper> I use an SVN for work project, and sometimes when a bug comes out of nowhere, I get paranoid and think that another dev changed my code.
[12:45:00] <mantas322> yeah
[12:45:02] <mantas322> me 2
[12:45:02] <LordThumper> So I check the logs, and check the differences between version by version
[12:45:08] <mantas322> those DAMN "others"
[12:45:11] <LordThumper> lol
[12:45:20] <Eviltwin> `git blame`
[12:45:35] <Eviltwin> Most useful command
[12:45:59] <lxsameer> how can i select all the elements that have X attr with the value of Y ?
[12:46:14] <LordThumper> Ah think SVN got blame command too, should start using it :)
[12:46:43] <Eviltwin> lxsameer: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[12:47:04] <lxsameer> thanks
[12:47:07] <LordThumper> Well Git you have everything locally, not having to wait for old version retrieval...
[12:49:06] <JAAulde> I heard breakpoints.js mentioned on the JavaScript Weekly podcast.  Just now checking it out.  The idea is great, and I need something like it.  But wow, the code is NOT proper jQuery.
[12:50:06] <lekefly_> jQuery should be loaded first right? since i need no conflict
[12:52:02] <EAN407> http://jsfiddle.net/4yE8S/ . if i drag&drop the pictures and try to drag it 500 ms or 1 seconds after the drop the image gets marked and not moved. anyone got a clue what could cause this?
[12:52:02] <mantas322> okay
[12:52:18] <mantas322> clearly someone is making changes to jquery-1.6.3.min.js:2
[12:52:23] <mantas322> or im losing my marbles
[12:53:02] <mantas322> OMG....
[12:53:40] <mantas322> wait-a-minute
[12:54:29] * khmer_ waits
[12:54:37] * EAN407 cant wait
[12:55:02] <badbandit> LordThumper: is it possible to use similar method to get the height of the loaded iframe content and then resize colorbox accordingly?
[12:57:50] <Eviltwin> badbandit: see ?.height and see ?.css
[12:57:50] <bot-t> badbandit, .height(): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/height/
[12:57:50] <bot-t> badbandit, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[13:03:27] <PPaul> how do i check if a jquery thingy is empty?
[13:03:32] <Eviltwin> .length
[13:03:44] <PPaul> this is no isEmpty function?
[13:03:57] <PPaul> there*
[13:03:58] <Eviltwin> The jQuery thingy is an array-like object
[13:04:07] <PPaul> i know...
[13:04:20] <khmer_> the developers have said it's unlikely to ever lose a length propery
[13:04:21] <PPaul> i'm trying to use array functions on it, but it's screwing up
[13:04:36] <PPaul> it's safe for me to use .toArray()?
[13:04:46] <Eviltwin> See ?.get
[13:04:46] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[13:04:48] <khmer_> what are you trying to do
[13:04:52] <Eviltwin> But seriously
[13:04:56] <Eviltwin> If you're just trying to see if it's empty
[13:04:57] <PPaul> using jquery and underscore together
[13:05:00] <Eviltwin> .length === 0
[13:05:09] <khmer_> PPaul: underscore should Just Work on jquery objects
[13:05:28] <PPaul> _.isEmpty() doesn't work at all
[13:05:49] <PPaul> would this be a bug in underscore?
[13:06:04] <Eviltwin> Dude...why are you using a function to tell you if an array/object is empty?
[13:06:11] <PPaul> why not?
[13:06:15] <khmer_> hmm, not precisely--more of an oversight
[13:06:25] <khmer_> or a choice to not have different functions for arrays and objects
[13:06:31] <khmer_> but you should just be testing the length
[13:06:39] <khmer_> the reason .isEmpty isn't working is that it also works on objects
[13:06:44] <t4nkd> How can I assert is an input checkbox is checked?
[13:06:46] <khmer_> so it does a quick for-in-hasOwnProperty
[13:06:53] <PPaul> i see
[13:06:58] <Eviltwin> t4nkd: .is(":checked")
[13:07:02] <t4nkd> ah tyty
[13:07:03] <khmer_> and gets the very few properties, like unique IDs, that are on the jquery array
[13:07:18] <PPaul> ooooooooh
[13:07:28] <khmer_> so just don't use isEmpty
[13:07:47] <khmer_> but also, EvilTwin's right--you can use .get() to get the array
[13:08:01] <Eviltwin> I try to be right more often than not
[13:08:10] <khmer_> keep working
[13:08:31] <t4nkd> and is .change the best event bind to assert a checkbox being checked and unchecked?
[13:08:41] <NoiseEee> t4nkd: click
[13:08:43] <khmer_> t4nkd: yeah
[13:08:49] <khmer_> don't listen to NoiseEee
[13:08:50] <t4nkd> Conflicting advvvvice ;0
[13:08:57] <khmer_> i'm prettier than he is
[13:09:04] <t4nkd> pics or no proof
[13:09:29] <Eviltwin> t4nkd: I'll second change
[13:09:41] <t4nkd> sweet, ty all
[13:09:52] <khmer_> the reason to use click is nonstandard behavior in IE<8 in quirks mode
[13:10:00] <khmer_> which you shouldn't be supporting!@#!$#!
[13:10:13] <t4nkd> Also, tabbing to the input and using space would toggle the input
[13:10:38] <khmer_> in most modern browsers that throws a click event, actually
[13:10:38] <theBrettman> I can't get on() to work right: http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/RWreg/
[13:10:41] <khmer_> but it SHOULDN'T
[13:10:50] <NoiseEee> it most certainly should :)
[13:10:50] <t4nkd> ah, interesting
[13:11:15] <khmer_> NoiseEee: why
[13:11:22] <NoiseEee> so i can do things without my mouse
[13:11:27] <khmer_> theBrettman: you're filtering that delegate to only fire on child elements of canvas, and there aren't any
[13:11:41] <NoiseEee> "do things" = navigate/interact/etc
[13:11:52] <khmer_> NoiseEee: NoiseEee itym "develop interfaces without thinking about accessibility b/c im lazy lol"
[13:11:57] <Eviltwin> theBrettman: You should probably just use the event.target
[13:12:01] <theBrettman> how do I make it do the canvas and child elements
[13:12:03] <khmer_> if it's not a click you shouldn't fire a click
[13:12:15] <khmer_> theBrettman: just omit the '*' argument
[13:12:19] <Eviltwin> And a normal on/bind
[13:12:23] <NoiseEee> khmer_: no, not unlike the way one can select items from an operating system window/menu without clicking your mouse
[13:12:34] <theBrettman> but then it won't work when I add new elements
[13:12:43] <Eviltwin> theBrettman: Sure it will
[13:12:44] <khmer_> theBrettman: yes it will--clicks will bubble up
[13:12:53] <EAN407> http://jsfiddle.net/4yE8S/ . if i drag&drop the pictures and try to drag it 500 ms or 1 seconds after the drop the image gets marked and not moved. anyone got a clue what could cause this?
[13:12:55] <Eviltwin> Just use the event.target
[13:12:59] <khmer_> NoiseEee: do you think the OS is firing click events?
[13:13:11] <khmer_> NoiseEee: or is it using the same handlers on keypress events, because that's what is actually happening
[13:13:18] <Eviltwin> EAN407: I don't see the behavior you're describing happening
[13:13:32] <EAN407> Eviltwin: what browser are you using?
[13:13:44] <Eviltwin> Safari
[13:13:45] <EAN407> Eviltwin: and are you trying it fast enough? :)
[13:14:07] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I can move faster than 500ms
[13:14:21] <NoiseEee> khmer_: i think as far as the OS is concerned, minus the word "event", when i'm in a program and i am actively selecting/doing something by pressing the spacebar, that is what should happen, and it should happen downwards to all other programs, including a web browser
[13:14:26] <EAN407> drag, drop and drag again the same item within 500 ms
[13:14:41] <Eviltwin> EAN407: Works just fine for me
[13:14:51] <NoiseEee> khmer_: not that i really think/care that much, but I do think a spacebar press should fire the click event.
[13:15:04] <khmer_> NoiseEee: in e.g. windows, WPF controls monitor for events--it's similar to a DOM
[13:15:25] <NoiseEee> khmer_: i just don't know that much about it, but i know its the same in my linux programs... nav through menu options, spacebar to activate
[13:15:33] <khmer_> and they monitor for things that actually happened--they don't do weird stuff like firing click on keypress because the government of new jersey complained that their intranet doesn't work anymore
[13:15:49] <khmer_> NoiseEee: right! i'm saying that the underlying event that fires should be what actually happened
[13:16:05] <khmer_> NoiseEee: it shouldn't fire a "click" event
[13:16:15] <khmer_> NoiseEee: because that violates the principle of least surprise
[13:16:16] <lxsameer> i want to add a tag and display it for a while and remove it . what do you suggest
[13:16:28] <khmer_> lxsameer: scotch tape
[13:16:31] <NoiseEee> khmer_: fair enough, but to the end user who doesn't know/care about computers, and is used to "making something happen" when the click the space bar, that should also happen in a web browser :)
[13:16:40] <EAN407> Eviltwin: thats intresting.
[13:16:50] <theBrettman> then there's some other problem: when I click on the new div, it does nothing: http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/RWreg/
[13:16:55] <theBrettman> oops
[13:16:56] <lxsameer> khmer_: excuse me i can't understand you
[13:16:57] <theBrettman> wrong url
[13:16:59] <khmer_> NoiseEee: yes! but the way it should happen is that web applications should make themselves work without click events
[13:17:04] <theBrettman> http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/3BVXx/1/
[13:17:06] <khmer_> lxsameer: i'm sorry, i'm joking
[13:17:06] <danzik17> EAN407: You might want to try preventing the native drag* events.
[13:17:12] <khmer_> lxsameer: setTimeout
[13:17:36] <theBrettman> and how do you save a fiddle?
[13:17:38] <NoiseEee> khmer_: right, but then you need to have intelligent web developers or the whole thing breaks :)
[13:17:58] <lxsameer> khmer_: i done that
[13:18:07] <khmer_> NoiseEee: no, only the stuff unintelligent web developers make breaks
[13:18:18] <EAN407> danzik17: what do you mean? i cant follow you
[13:18:32] <lxsameer> khmer_: bad when i use remove at the end of callback the tag did not add at all
[13:18:45] <khmer_> lxsameer: you should make a jsfiddle!
[13:19:06] <lxsameer> khmer_: whats that
[13:19:24] <Eviltwin> theBrettman: http://jsfiddle.net/KS6uK/
[13:19:29] <Eviltwin> Try clicking some of those things
[13:19:43] <danzik17> EAN407: If I'm encountering the same "issue" I'm guessing it may be because the the native drag events.  Not sure though.  See https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop
[13:19:50] <Eviltwin> Including the one that says "foo"
[13:20:48] <EAN407> danzik17: is there a solution to prevent native drag&drop?
[13:21:07] <theBrettman> ok so why doesn't this work then? http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/3BVXx/1/
[13:22:02] <khmer_> theBrettman: it...does?
[13:22:21] <Eviltwin> theBrettman: Look at my fiddle
[13:22:26] <Eviltwin> At "My way"
[13:22:32] <EAN407> danzik17: i got a clue... its revet = true...
[13:22:33] <theBrettman> I did
[13:22:37] <theBrettman> and it doesn't
[13:22:40] <Eviltwin> You'll see that below //My way there's no reference to "this"
[13:23:02] <theBrettman> when u click on one of the new div's u create, it should select it and change the classes
[13:23:39] <theBrettman> ohhh, let me try that event.target
[13:23:44] <Eviltwin> Maybe you can try explaining a little more precisely what you're trying to do
[13:24:08] <theBrettman> I was asking the best way to do that before, but that's not so easy, lol
[13:24:56] <pensfan> how do i change where jquery ui looks for images

[13:30:37] <theBrettman> first, I want to select an element, either the canvas or a child element to append the new element to
[13:31:02] <theBrettman> the new element gets a temporary bg color
[13:31:39] <theBrettman> when u click it, it selects it and removes the bg color and adds the border to show it's selected
[13:32:00] <NoiseEee> EAN407: it's the revert:true
[13:32:05] <theBrettman> I do all that with classes that way I can append it to the element with that class
[13:32:11] <NoiseEee> EAN407: if you take that away i bet you can't replicate your issue

[13:35:04] <andrew9183> http://jsfiddle.net/3BVXx/4/
[13:35:21] <NoiseEee> bakers: thats why the advice to 'never use user agents' is given in general
[13:35:43] <theBrettman> yep, that did it. why didn't it work the way I did it?
[13:35:44] <bakers> NoiseEee: I'm trying to do write an is_mobile() function to detect and change display
[13:35:53] <Eviltwin> bakers: User agents lie
[13:35:58] <Eviltwin> They always have
[13:36:04] <andrew9183> bakers, addClass / removeClass are jquery functions
[13:36:06] <Eviltwin> Pretty much everything says it's some flavor of Mozilla
[13:36:14] <andrew9183> oops, s/bakers/theBrettman
[13:36:42] <xp_prg> hello, anyone here?
[13:36:57] <Eviltwin> xp_prg: No, there's no one here
[13:36:58] <mayhem93> hey, is there a reverse .serialize() method? i want to convert a string (URL encoded notation) into an array, or map of objects
[13:36:59] <theBrettman> oh, so I had to have the selector!
[13:37:05] <xp_prg> oh good, just checking
[13:37:05] <Morteza_ipo> hi
[13:37:15] <andrew9183> xp_prg: where is everyone ?
[13:37:23] <xp_prg> andrew9183 nobody is here
[13:37:27] <Eviltwin> mytoz: I think you want the opposite of $.param
[13:37:33] <Eviltwin> There's a plugin called $.deparam
[13:37:49] <Morteza_ipo> how to run a function for once!
[13:38:08] <Morteza_ipo> how to run a function for once with timer!
[13:38:16] <andrew9183> you can use .one
[13:38:42] <Eviltwin> Morteza_ipo: This sounds like a #javascript issue
[13:38:51] <theBrettman> so how do I save a fiddle to my fiddles?
[13:39:00] <xp_prg> I need to select the first column of the first row of a table, how can I know what the jquery selector syntax should be to do that?
[13:40:04] <andrew9183> xp_prg, you can read about selectors
[13:40:20] <Eviltwin> xp_prg: Lookup :nth-child
[13:40:21] <Morteza_ipo> Eviltwin: Ok , thanks
[13:40:32] <Eviltwin> Or perhaps :eq
[13:40:43] <xp_prg> but is there like a tool that can tell you what the jquery selector would be for an element on a web page?
[13:41:16] <NoiseEee> xp_prg: firebug will show you the querySelectorAll path
[13:41:38] <xp_prg> NoiseEee where does it show that?
[13:41:54] <mayhem93> could no one answer my question :-s ?
[13:42:04] <andrew9183> eviltwin did
[13:42:16] <andrew9183> (04:37:28 PM) Eviltwin: mytoz: I think you want the opposite of $.param
[13:42:16] <andrew9183> (04:37:35 PM) Eviltwin: There's a plugin called $.deparam
[13:42:20] <andrew9183> just to the wrong person :P
[13:42:27] <NoiseEee> xp_prg: inspect element, then up top you'll see a list like:  div#id < div#otherID < body < html
[13:42:46] <xp_prg> oh ok ya I see that
[13:43:17] <Eviltwin> I constantly mistarget people here
[13:43:18] <xp_prg> but can I put that in $('').val() to get the value of the element?
[13:43:29] <NoiseEee> Eviltwin: good thing you're not an assassin
[13:43:31] <Eviltwin> I'm too used to tab-completing nicks off the first letter
[13:44:01] <Eviltwin> xp_prg: You might be looking for .text() or .html()
[13:44:51] <xp_prg> oh ok twin that is Evil but learning how to be good
[13:45:18] <Eviltwin> Unless it's an input or textarea or select or something

[14:04:58] <EBisumaru> eviltwin: the ease of a link :(
[14:06:07] <xp_prg> ok, firebug gives me the css path or the xpath path, css is working for me but is it better to use xpath or css path?
[14:06:22] <xp_prg> I would prefer css path as I want to know my css more than xpath
[14:06:35] <NoiseEee> xp_prg: you can use any means you wish to get there

[14:25:39] <blindMoe> Eviltwin: yes

[14:27:18] <Eviltwin> Just absolutely position two images over each other

[14:27:52] <blindMoe> I wanted a plugin to make it easy
[14:28:19] <Eviltwin> Make one
[14:28:23] <whoever_> is there a special way to refer to echo <<<OUTPUT vAR <<<OUTPUT in jquery or just refer to it ie : var ==some number : when i try to refer to the php output it seems to break my code but if i creat a var directly in my code and use an if block i'm fine
[14:28:29] <whoever_> any ideas
[14:28:31] <whoever_> ??
[14:28:44] <blindMoe> Eviltwin: so you answer is, no, you don't know of a plugin that does it ;)
[14:28:55] <Eviltwin> Yes
[14:29:09] <Eviltwin> But it also feels kind of light for a real plugin
[14:35:06] <jesse_> Does anyone know about how jQuery works when doing something like: $('div').append('<script src="some_script.js"></script>')
[14:35:13] <Eviltwin> Yes
[14:35:18] <Eviltwin> Why?
[14:35:41] <jesse_> Is there anyway I can change the chaching config for the request it makes?
[14:37:24] <black_warlock> halp doest work fully =(
[14:37:25] <Eviltwin> Not directly however you can probably do something like $("<div>").append("...<script src='...'>...").find("script").each(function(){this.src=this.src+"?_=foobar"}).end().children().appendTo("#realcontainer")
[14:37:29] <Eviltwin> Maybe

[15:29:26] <badbandit> is it possible at all to at least determine the height of an external iframe?

[15:47:09] <aminho> Hi, anyone could point me to a way to serialize a dom element attributes ?
[15:47:26] <Eviltwin> aminho: .outerHTML
[15:48:13] <aitiba> hi
[15:48:28] <aitiba> has ever someone ever use jquery.validationEngine please?
[15:49:24] <sean71> Hi does anyone know the best way to convert html to an image file?
[15:49:42] <aminho> I want this kind of output : member:href=url&id=uid for <a member:href="url" id="uid">anchor text</a>
[15:50:01] <aminho> href=url&id=uid for <a href="url" id="uid">anchor text</a>
[15:50:15] <aminho> Eviltwin:  how does outterHTML will help me to achieve that ?
[15:50:32] <Emn1ty> so can anyone explain this: http://vehicleinventorynetwork.com/jon/newportCoastAuto/profile.php?vin=WBAWR33559P154598 (click options).
[15:50:49] <Emn1ty> this only happens if I slide the div up initially on the page for the button functionality.
[15:51:05] <Emn1ty> somehow the div is getting resized to 0
[15:51:18] <Emn1ty> and it won't remain open with content
[15:51:28] <Eviltwin> aminho: Why are you trying to do this?
[15:52:38] <someprimetime> Emn1ty: can i have that car? i promise i'll make the site work nicely
[15:54:05] <aminho> Eviltwin: --> undefined
[15:55:30] <black_warlock> nothing
[15:55:31] <black_warlock>  $(this).closest('li').find($('ul').first()).toggle('slow');
[15:56:20] <Eviltwin> aminho: Why are you trying to do this?
[15:56:40] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: You were closer before
[15:56:50] <black_warlock> i think im just gonna use ids hell
[15:56:53] <black_warlock> XD
[15:56:56] <Eviltwin> $(this).closest('li').find('ul').first().toggle('slow');
[15:57:02] <aminho> Eviltwin: i need to pass an element attribute as get parameters to an external url
[15:57:11] <Eviltwin> But why?
[15:57:58] <aminho> Eviltwin: i can't figure out why you need the reason but still, here it is: i'm storing useful data in custom html tags
[15:58:09] <Eviltwin> see ?.data
[15:58:09] <aminho> and i want to retrieve them and pass them along to other urls
[15:58:09] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[15:58:29] <Eviltwin> For storing data, HTML5 spec says you should use data-* attributes
[15:58:36] <Eviltwin> And .data() allows you to access those
[15:58:42] <Eviltwin> And then store further arbitrary data
[15:58:49] <Eviltwin> (That's why I was asking)
[16:01:06] <aminho> Eviltwin: data doesn't store in the element, but in $.cache
[16:01:26] <Eviltwin> Correct, because the DOM shouldn't be used for active storage
[16:01:33] <aminho> i already have "data" on my elements, as attributes, i want to retrieve *those* and serialize them
[16:01:52] <aminho> Eviltwin: ok i agree :) but this is the way it is
[16:01:53] <Eviltwin> aminho: http://api.jquery.com/data/#data-html5
[16:02:35] <aminho> Eviltwin: interesting, so data should be prefixed with "data-"
[16:02:49] <Eviltwin> Correct
[16:03:02] <aminho> Eviltwin: hmmm, more generally, isn't there a way to get all the attributes, and then serialize them ?
[16:03:20] <Eviltwin> I don't think there's anything cross-browser
[16:03:30] <aminho> ok ok, interesting
[16:03:44] <whoever_> can i use jsfiddle to test with php
[16:04:20] <Eviltwin> Do you mean like AJAX?
[16:05:07] * muzone is now playing: Muzone - Call Girl (http://home.no/mritz/Untitled.mp3)
[16:08:54] <dougb> if i get html data back from an ajax request and set it as a variable, is it possible to get the HTML from a div in that variable?
[16:09:55] <eddiemonge> dougb: yes. wrap the var or the returned data in $(  )
[16:10:39] <dougb> eddiemonge: would i do $(d).find('#id-name').html()?
[16:13:18] <eddiemonge> yes
[16:14:35] <whoever_> how can an if statement be causing me problems code works if seems to be of propper syntax and then doesn't work, can someone assist ?
[16:15:05] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ whoever_
[16:15:05] <bot-t> whoever_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[16:17:15] <dougb> perfect, thanks eddiemonge
[16:17:37] <whoever_> http://70.112.221.69  its the "how to install" button from mobile won't work once i add the if currently the if is there
[16:18:06] <eddiemonge> where?
[16:18:10] <eddiemonge> what code?
[16:18:12] <Aethaeryn> Once I $.getJSON() successfully, what is the best way to get "data" to be returned from that callback function thing?
[16:18:45] <whoever_> eddiemonge: provided link to site, and currently the if block is in my init.js file
[16:19:13] <eddiemonge> $("#reqButton").attr("disabled",false); <-- should be using .prop() there
[16:19:29] <eddiemonge> ?getjson @ Aethaeryn
[16:19:29] <bot-t> Aethaeryn, jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[16:19:33] <someprimetime> Aethaeryn: should be in the data object returned by the success callback
[16:19:38] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: Believe so
[16:19:48] <eddiemonge> Aethaeryn: read the docs on it
[16:19:52] <Aethaeryn> someprimetime: Yes, it's in the data object.
[16:20:13] <Aethaeryn> eddiemonge: I did read the docs, it's a separate issue than getJSON
[16:20:21] <Aethaeryn> It's more like get from getJSON to some place where I can use it
[16:21:14] <someprimetime> Aethaeryn: what are you trying to do with it?
[16:21:19] <Turncoat> Hello!
[16:21:24] <Aethaeryn> I'm trying to use the JSON it retrieves to determine the strings to render onto a <canvas> in another javascript function.
[16:22:09] <eddiemonge> Aethaeryn: where are you stuck at?
[16:22:48] <eddiemonge> whoever_: im confused since it "seems" to be working. whats not working about it?
[16:23:25] <whoever_> eddiemonge: it works from mobile device untill i add the if block
[16:24:32] <whoever_> when I add the if block the button will not work from mobile device but i can assume thet the click event registers since the button will momentarly chang color
[16:25:05] <eddiemonge> whoever_: which mobile device? it might be the multiple alerts
[16:25:06] <Aethaeryn> eddiemonge: the web examples seem to imply that in the callback function I should $("#foo").append(data) or something along those lines.
[16:25:28] <whoever_> eddiemonge: droid
[16:25:31] <eddiemonge> Aethaeryn: those are to show one way of using the returned data
[16:25:45] <Aethaeryn> ah
[16:25:47] <aminho> Eviltwin: thanks for the insight on "data", i'll have to ask for changes but this is a "cleaner" way
[16:25:55] <Aethaeryn> eddiemonge: So there's other ways?
[16:26:09] <Aethaeryn> the problem is I google this stuff and I get the same answer 100 times
[16:26:11] <Eviltwin> aminho: I agree
[16:26:16] <whoever_> eddiemonge: it can't be the alerts since the alert("still alive"); will still  fire
[16:26:38] <eddiemonge> Aethaeryn: not really. you get data returned and whatever you pass into the success callback will be what you use
[16:26:57] <eddiemonge> whoever_: i mean the multiple same alerts from clicking the button each time
[16:27:34] <Aethaeryn> eddiemonge: So I should pass foobar into the callback and have some foobar.setText(data) instead of trying to get the JSON from getJSON into foobar somehow?
[16:28:57] <whoever_> eddiemonge: ah, fyi: the only reason the alerts are there was because I was testing a contition and getting  the same problem where when i add the if block the button will not fire correctly from mobile device(android )
[16:29:11] <badbandit> im still confused, how is it that I can load an iframe from an external domain and it's in my dom, yet I cannot determine the height of what is contained?
[16:29:27] <badbandit> makes my lightbox look out of wack completely
[16:29:38] <badbandit> when they go from page to page in the iframe inside
[16:30:21] <Turncoat> I'm taking a javascript class (college), weeee.
[16:31:05] <xp_prg> hi all, I am using this:  $('#nyb_slider').slider('values', 0, 80); this changes the screen but the slide: function( event, ui ) { doesn't fire
[16:31:08] <xp_prg> any ideas why?
[16:34:35] <whoever_> eddiemonge: should .prop gray a button out? because it doesn't seem to do it just prevent the code behind it from executing
[16:36:36] <eddiemonge> Aethaeryn: huh? how about you create a simple jsfiddle for what you are asking?
[16:37:02] <eddiemonge> badbandit: an iframe from an external domain in your dom?
[16:37:50] <badbandit> yeah
[16:38:01] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: how/where are you attaching the slide event handler?
[16:38:02] <badbandit> or at least I think it is? in firebug I can see it
[16:38:28] <Aethaeryn> eddiemonge: nevermind
[16:38:31] <eddiemonge> whoever_: it should yes if you are doing disable and the button isnt styled some other way than default
[16:39:10] <Aethaeryn> eddiemonge: What I was trying to do is pass data from the callback function to another javascript function. Instead I just access that function from within the callback function.
[16:40:44] <eddiemonge> badbandit: i meant that question doesnt make sense. if its an external domain, you arent going to be able to get its height
[16:41:13] <eddiemonge> Aethaeryn: or you could use the jqXHR object in the other function
[16:41:19] <Emn1ty> got an interesting bug for you guys
[16:41:37] <eddiemonge> Aethaeryn: using deferreds
[16:41:39] <whoever_> eddiemonge:  i tested an if wher i define the var in document.ready, and that worked, but the var i am trying to use was echoed out with php. i can alert the value so I know that the value is there but when i try to use that value in an  if  that button stops working
[16:41:54] <Emn1ty> not sure if its me or anyone else yet: http://vehicleinventorynetwork.com/jon/newportCoastAuto/profile.php?vin=WBAWR33559P154598 -> scroll to the bottom of the page and then click the options butt and then click back. look at the bottom of the description window and tell me if you see anything
[16:42:12] <eddiemonge> whoever_: why do you have so many different js files? it makes troubleshooting so hard
[16:42:42] <Doggie52> eddiemonge, no it doesn't
[16:42:46] <Doggie52> it makes it easier
[16:42:56] <Doggie52> he can just disable file per file
[16:42:59] <Doggie52> and see where the error is
[16:43:06] <eddiemonge> its not an error though
[16:43:06] <Aethaeryn> I think there's a happy medium in files.
[16:43:18] <eddiemonge> Emn1ty: what am i not supposed to see?
[16:43:18] <Aethaeryn> I've seen some programs that must have a dozen 20-50 line js files
[16:43:23] <whoever_> eddiemonge: if js i want to do one thing, if mobile, i want to do  another
[16:43:26] <Aethaeryn> It hurts readability.
[16:43:41] <Emn1ty> eddie: do you see a small glitched out portion of the options?
[16:43:50] <Emn1ty> just below the description?
[16:44:04] <Emn1ty> if you highlight it then it vanishes
[16:44:18] <Doggie52> Aethaeryn, no it doesn't
[16:44:23] <eddiemonge> Emn1ty: screenshot it
[16:44:29] <eddiemonge> Doggie52: differing opinions
[16:44:37] <Doggie52> if split up correctly it improves readibility
[16:44:47] <Doggie52> sure if you have 1.js, 2.js, 3.js it's not going to be good
[16:45:56] <eddiemonge> Doggie52: for simple troubleshooting here, it makes it harder. especially since its free support. in a commercial application then yes, there is no issue in having lots of files for development only
[16:46:03] <whoever_> eddiemonge: even when i comment out all but the if statement problem still exists
[16:46:03] <Turncoat> who the heck names their files 1.js, 2.js, and 3.js ? :P
[16:46:16] <Aethaeryn> Doggie52: okay, it wasn't split up correctly
[16:46:27] <Aethaeryn> Doggie52: I had to go across three files just to see how he preloaded images

[16:48:24] <xp_prg> eddiemonge its in $('#nyb_slider').slider({
[16:48:30] <eddiemonge> Emn1ty: and that looks like your css isnt correct
[16:48:37] <whoever_> eddiemonge: ff error console is trying to tell me that mobile is not defined in init.js but the variable was echoed out with php
[16:49:10] <whoever_> eddiemonge: no i do not get the alert
[16:49:13] <Emn1ty> ediiemonge: using chrome
[16:49:36] <xp_prg> trying to evoke the slide handler manually with something like:  s.trigger('slide',{ ui: $('.ui-slider-handle', s), value: 10 });
[16:49:50] <xp_prg> I am not sure if .ui-slider-handle is correct etc...
[16:50:13] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: its not. read the ui docs for that to see how to chnge where the handle is
[16:51:14] <xp_prg> eddiemonge not trying to sound sarcastic but could take me weeks to understand :(
[16:51:31] <eddiemonge> whoever_: can you screenshot the error because im not seeing it in chrome or firefox
[16:52:35] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: what are you trying to do exactly? just change slider value?
[16:52:55] <CrazyZurfer> hello people
[16:53:00] <xp_prg> I can change the value but it doesn't actually call the slide function
[16:53:18] <xp_prg> I want to send an event to the slider to get it to call the function associated with the slide event
[16:53:57] <CrazyZurfer> is there anything to center vertically a div inside another div? because I've seen how do people center divs, but they center it in the screen and not inside another div :S
[16:56:27] <eddiemonge_> love getting disconnected and then cant get my nick back
[16:56:34] <eddiemonge_> whatd i miss?
[16:56:44] <xp_prg> hi eddiemonge welcome back
[16:56:57] <xp_prg> I am trying like crazy to call the slide event on my slider
[16:57:32] <whoever_> eddiemonge: http://imagebin.org/193317
[16:57:39] <eddiemonge_> why do you want to call the slide event?
[16:57:57] <xp_prg> because I it updates other areas of the web page
[16:58:02] <xp_prg> based on the slider values
[16:58:15] <eddiemonge_> xp_prg:  maybe you should fix that syntax error so mobile can get defined
[16:58:42] <eddiemonge_> xp_prg: shouldnt the event get called when, you know, you actually move the slider?
[16:59:28] <xp_prg> it doesn't
[16:59:36] <xp_prg> when you do it programatically if you will
[17:00:02] <eddiemonge_> xp_prg: can you paste some example code please see ? demo
[17:00:02] <bot-t> xp_prg, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[17:00:29] <someprimetime> any ideas on how to handle a non-infinite scroll on this? http://jsfiddle.net/K9EYk/14/
[17:01:23] <eddiemonge_> someprimetime: what do you mean?
[17:01:57] <someprimetime> i'm thinking of maybe keeping track of the total container elements and then setting a count variable and decrementing it each time (rightClick()) is triggered. if the number of elements left are < = the number of elements in the ul, then i'll prevent the user from clicking right again
[17:02:03] <someprimetime> but that way could get messy quickly
[17:02:23] <someprimetime> eddiemonge_: say i set a variable to infinite = false and i don't want to keep the infinite scroll on that carousel
[17:02:26] <whoever_> eddiemonge: did you check out thats screenshot i posted
[17:03:25] <Sazpaimon> should I ask about drag/drop file uploading here or would this be more within the scope of #html5?
[17:04:08] <Sazpaimon> well I guess that answers my question
[17:04:09] <someprimetime> once you get to the ith element, and that's all that exist within the ul, there shouldn't be any additional population of elements after that (e.g. there are 15 list elements, the user sees 3 at a time, they can only click right 4 times)
[17:06:01] <eddiemonge_> whoever_: yeah. you need to fix that "typo" first so mobile can get defined. since there is an error in that script, mobile isnt getting defined
[17:06:35] <eddiemonge_> someprimetime: is the scroll actually scrolling?
[17:08:13] <someprimetime> eddiemonge_: what do you mean?
[17:08:48] <eddiemonge_> someprimetime: like what does clicking right actually? how does it scroll it?
[17:08:55] <someprimetime> it just animates and takes the # of specified list elements to move @ a time (specified by the user within the html data attribute) although there is a default one, in case they didn't specify it of 2 to slide @ a time
[17:09:39] <Sazpaimon> should I ask about drag/drop file uploading here or would this be more within the scope of #html5?
[17:09:47] <whoever_> eddiemonge_: it is defind
[17:09:52] <whoever_> already
[17:10:06] <whoever_> i can pastebin the script
[17:10:14] <whoever_> if you would like
[17:11:36] <eddiemonge_> whoever_: i thought it was defined in that same script
[17:11:58] <eddiemonge_> Sazpaimon: if its the native drag drop then #html5. if its the jqueryui one then here
[17:13:06] <whoever_> eddiemonge_: no all values are produed by php and echo <<< OUTPUT  so you would think you can refer to them directly -
[17:13:16] <xp_prg> what am I doing wrong here?  http://jsfiddle.net/gUd3x/
[17:13:53] <eddiemonge_> whoever_: in that screenshot you had, there was an error above the mobile not defined one. fix that error
[17:14:03] <someprimetime> xp_prg: what exactly are you trying to do?
[17:14:14] <xp_prg> create a simple slidfer
[17:14:21] <someprimetime> well you got some work to do :P
[17:14:32] <xp_prg> what am I missing?
[17:14:39] <eddiemonge_> xp_prg: not including the jqui css : http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/gUd3x/1/
[17:15:06] <someprimetime> xp_prg: whoops my fault i didn't see you were including query ui
[17:15:08] <someprimetime> jquery, rather
[17:15:25] <eddiemonge_> heres better http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/gUd3x/2/
[17:15:25] <someprimetime> thought you were writing a plugin and didn't include that code in this fiddle
[17:15:56] <Sazpaimon> eddiemonge_, doesnt jquery's drag/drop use html5 though?
[17:16:04] <eddiemonge_> Sazpaimon: no
[17:16:18] <xp_prg> eddiemonge_ forgive me but why is margin: 25px needed, margin is how big something is around a paper right?
[17:16:48] <someprimetime> xp_prg: it's just for that demo
[17:16:55] <someprimetime> since i think jsfiddle sets the margin @ 0
[17:16:59] <someprimetime> but i could be mistaken
[17:17:55] <eddiemonge_> xp_prg: makes it easier to grab the slider. not required. only makes the demo prettier
[17:23:01] <whoever_> eddiemonge_: that error  is a false error i looked at the script and its defined
[17:23:01] <black_warlock> Eviltwin
[17:23:42] <black_warlock> how can i set the + become - when the ul is not hidden
[17:23:44] <eddiemonge_> whoever_: this is not valid:   var some = ;
[17:24:02] <eddiemonge_> yeah Eviltwin how?
[17:25:04] <someprimetime> black_warlock: what are you even asking?
[17:25:05] <someprimetime> lol
[17:25:10] <someprimetime> what + and what -
[17:25:15] <someprimetime> and what ul
[17:25:23] <someprimetime> your questions are pretty ambiguous
[17:26:43] <xp_prg> ok eddiemonge_ I recreated it:  http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/gUd3x/2/
[17:26:55] <xp_prg> it changes the slider but the slide event is not called!
[17:27:09] <black_warlock> i ve asked to evil because he has seen the script alr
[17:27:27] <whoever_> eddiemonge_: that is true, but the script that creats it it is initalized then when the script is run the values are assignd
[17:27:29] <someprimetime> xp_prg: did you press update on jsfiddle?
[17:27:33] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/Wsd5R/88/
[17:27:45] <xp_prg> http://jsfiddle.net/gUd3x/3/
[17:27:47] <xp_prg> oops no
[17:28:14] <whoever_> eddiemonge_:  see http://70.112.221.69/php/init.php
[17:28:55] <eddiemonge_> whoever_: if there is an error in the js file, some clients will not parse any of the file
[17:29:30] <slide> damnit people stop dinging me
[17:30:11] <eddiemonge_> xp_prg: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/gUd3x/4/
[17:30:44] <someprimetime> lol slide
[17:30:50] <xp_prg> eddiemonge_ I want to do this programatically
[17:30:59] <xp_prg> this is done with jquery
[17:31:10] <xp_prg> not by clicking on it with a mouse etc...
[17:31:27] <cylence> If I have an ajax callback bound to an object, and it triggers (which works great). My function args look like this (event, data, status, xhr).
[17:31:45] <cylence> I'm needing to do something in a function TO the object that was clicked. how can I pass that through to another function?
[17:31:55] <cylence> passing this doesn't seem to work
[17:32:49] <xp_prg> eddiemonge_ I know I need to use trigger or .call
[17:33:22] <cylence> console.log(this) returns the element in question. Can't I do something by passing the event?
[17:34:45] <xp_prg> this is the closest thing I have found that would allow for this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2833396/jquery-ui-slider-setting-programatically
[17:34:56] <xp_prg> I don't know how to adapt it to my example
[17:35:24] <eddiemonge_> xp_prg: simple version: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/gUd3x/5/
[17:36:22] <xp_prg> eddiemonge_ I don't have the ability to add any html or css, you keep changing the rules :>
[17:36:42] <xp_prg> the only thing I can do is use jquery!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[17:36:52] <imsky> jae kwery
[17:38:15] <someprimetime> xp_prg: so add css rules from within your js file
[17:38:20] <someprimetime> duh.
[17:38:31] <eddiemonge_> xp_prg: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/gUd3x/6/
[17:39:03] <eddiemonge_> xp_prg: all im doing is making it easier to tell what the hell is going on to make the demo easier to use
[17:39:51] <xp_prg> ok, well, I just need to programatically fire the slide event
[17:40:20] <eddiemonge_> whoever_: is something changing the value of mobile?
[17:42:43] <xp_prg> eddiemonge why doesn't this work?  http://jsfiddle.net/gUd3x/7/
[17:44:03] <xp_prg> oh wow I think I figured it out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[17:44:20] <whoever_> eddiemonge_: ok so far got past that, php or the browser didn't like it being initialized as empty, even though the values outputed correctly
[17:45:28] <xp_prg> check this out eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/gUd3x/8/
[17:45:43] <lonelybrownfox> hi everyone, is there a need to place the jquery link (<script href=jquery.js) on every page? or placing it once on index.php for instance is enough?
[17:46:29] <eddiemonge_> lonelybrownfox: every page that you want it on
[17:46:37] <xp_prg> it calls the event but doesn't change the actual slider
[17:46:41] <whoever_> eddiemonge_: which seems to still escape me how even though something can still be initialized as an empty string the brovser will complain
[17:46:42] <xp_prg> oh well
[17:47:10] <eddiemonge_> xp_prg: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/gUd3x/9/
[17:47:42] <eddiemonge_> actually http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/gUd3x/10/
[17:48:03] <eddiemonge_> whoever_: you werent doing an empty string. an empty string is  ""
[17:48:27] <xp_prg> eddiemong_ that doesn't call the slide function
[17:48:32] <lonelybrownfox> eddiemonge_: ok, im having trouble when i call a page inside another page using ajax.  when i place the link on both pages, the actions on the page being called don't function, but when i remove it, it does.
[17:50:20] <eddiemonge_> xp_prg: i dont think you want slide. you want change
[17:50:26] <xp_prg> eddiemong_ this does almost 100% of what I want: http://jsfiddle.net/gUd3x/11/
[17:50:35] <xp_prg> I just wish I could use trigger, its kind of ugly
[17:50:56] <xp_prg> eddiemong_ I don't have that flexibility, I can't change what is already there
[17:51:20] <eddiemonge_> xp_prg: you said you could
[17:51:32] <xp_prg> I can only use jquery
[17:51:39] <xp_prg> if I said that I was way wrong
[17:52:35] <eddiemonge_> http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/gUd3x/12/
[17:52:52] <eddiemonge_> lonelybrownfox: huh? demo please
[17:53:33] <xp_prg> eddiemonge_ for the 100th time, I can use jquery but I can't change what is already there, anyway I know the answer now
[17:53:33] <whoever_> eddiemonge_: thats what i trid first and i still got error var =; so i but a value in and it quit complainin'
[17:53:55] <xp_prg> here is the solution as it stands now: http://jsfiddle.net/gUd3x/13/
[17:54:07] <xp_prg> it looks ugly to me, I wish it could be smaller and use trigger instead of call
[17:54:38] <eddiemonge_> xp_prg: why cant you change the slider function?
[17:54:54] <xp_prg> because it is previously written code, I don't have that ability
[17:55:21] <xp_prg> can I simplify this somehow with trigger:  $('#my_slider').slider('option','slide')
[17:55:21] <xp_prg>        .call($('#my_slider'),null,{ handle: $('.ui-slider-handle',$('#my_slider')), values: [10,80] });
[17:55:32] <xp_prg> brb
[17:56:21] <eddiemonge_> xp_prg: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/gUd3x/14/
[17:56:36] <lonelybrownfox> eddiemonge_: page 1 calls page2.  page1 has 3 columns. when page2 is called, the content should appears on the center column. if i put the jquery links on both pages(1 & 2), the jquery functions on page 2 will not work, but if i remove the jquery link on page 2 it works fine.
[17:58:30] <lonelybrownfox> eddiemonge_: I am embedding page 2 inside page 1
[17:58:48] <eddiemonge_> what does page 1 calls page 2 mean?
[17:59:08] <eddiemonge_> what does "jquery links" mean?
[17:59:32] <eddiemonge_> how are you "embedding them"?
[18:00:05] <zarzar> can i setup a function outside of the $(function(){}); decleration that i can call it within?
[18:00:13] <eddiemonge_> yes
[18:00:29] <zarzar> is there some trick to it? just declaring it outside doesn't work
[18:00:34] <eddiemonge_> it should
[18:00:43] <eddiemonge_> if it doesnt, it means you are doing something wrong
[18:00:45] <zarzar> the functions are in an external js file
[18:01:26] <eddiemonge_> as long as the ready() block has access to the scope that the other function is in, it can call it
[18:01:47] <xp_prg> eddiemonge_ that changes the fundamental object by adding an entire new function to it, that is not what I want to do
[18:01:53] <lonelybrownfox> eddiemonge_: assuming account.php has a menu "account details", when click it will show the details on accountdetails.php, however, im using ajax so that there's no need to refresh the entire page.  what i want is to should the result of accountdetails.php inside the account.php--in one of its column.
[18:02:12] <xp_prg> I'll just use my ugly solution
[18:02:42] <zarzar> eddiemonge_: what do you mean, as long as it has access to the global scope?
[18:03:18] <eddiemonge_> xp_prg: what the hell is this for then? i feel like im doing your homework for you
[18:03:39] <xp_prg> its for testing
[18:03:41] <xp_prg> its not homework
[18:03:42] <eddiemonge_> lonelybrownfox: ok im with you so far
[18:03:55] <eddiemonge_> xp_prg: ive given you numerous solutions
[18:04:48] <lonelybrownfox> eddiemonge: the jquery functions on accountdetails.php do not work if i place the <script> link on it.
[18:04:50] <xp_prg> eddiemong ok no worries, I appreciate your help greatly, just need a very specific approach for this to work, I am testing a web page with it
[18:04:53] <eddiemonge> zarzar: if you defined the function in the global scope, it should be accessible anywhere
[18:05:23] <eddiemonge> lonelybrownfox: thats because you probably arent parsing that pages scripts
[18:05:33] <eddiemonge> if you use .get or .load, it wont parse those
[18:05:45] <zarzar> this doesn't work for me http://jsfiddle.net/u8LAv/2/
[18:06:59] <lonelybrownfox> eddiemonge: i just do this to show the data from called page: $('#centercolumn').html(data);
[18:07:15] <eddiemonge> lonelybrownfox: works just fine for me: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/u8LAv/3/
[18:07:46] <zarzar> eddiemonge: yes it works in js fiddle, but it doesn't work when you actually have the test function in an external file
[18:08:10] <xp_prg> got it to work!!!!!!!  thanks for all of your help eddiemonge forgive me for frustrating you, you are god like to me :>
[18:09:25] <zarzar> this is the setup
[18:09:25] <zarzar> http://jsfiddle.net/rFZjm/1/
[18:10:59] <eddiemonge> lonelybrownfox: yeah the scripts for that page are not being parsed
[18:11:25] <eddiemonge> zarzar: which file has which function?
[18:11:56] <zarzar> test.js has the 'test' function, main.js has the doc.ready calling 'test'
[18:12:11] <eddiemonge> zarzar: got this on a live page?
[18:12:26] <zarzar> eddiemonge: nope, only local
[18:12:36] <zarzar> i can tar it up if need be
[18:12:41] <lonelybrownfox> eddiemonge: how should i parse it? i don't think i know that. is that the right way of getting data intead of like this $('#centercolumn').html(data)
[18:13:28] <eddiemonge> lonelybrownfox: you shouldnt be loading a page that has its own functions. if you do, you probably will need to do see ? getscript
[18:13:28] <bot-t> lonelybrownfox, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[18:13:28] <lonelybrownfox> eddiemonge: if u just want to show the content of one page inside another page?
[18:13:47] <eddiemonge> lonelybrownfox: just for showing content ajax.load is fine
[18:13:55] <eddiemonge> ?ajax.load @ lonelybrownfox
[18:13:56] <bot-t> lonelybrownfox, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[18:17:04] <eddiemonge> zarzar: works fine for me: http://www.etiger13.com/
[18:17:19] <zarzar> eddiemonge: i see the issue now. if i have more than 2 external js files, it doesn't work
[18:18:10] <lonelybrownfox> ok guys, so probably what went wrong is how i called it. What is important is to know that all pages must have a link <script> for jquery? because i was thinking that placing it once inside the index.php is enough for all the pages.
[18:18:32] <eddiemonge> zarzar: that doesnt matter
[18:18:45] <eddiemonge> unless one of the other files is over writing that function
[18:19:21] <zarzar> oh wow... the file was in the wrong folder
[18:19:35] <zarzar> :/
[18:19:46] <zarzar> eddiemonge: thanks for the help. was a stupid mistake on my part.
[18:21:18] <eddiemonge> http://www.etiger13.com/
[18:21:28] <eddiemonge> i need to not be bored
[18:21:55] <Turncoat> argh, I need to find an active vb.net chat room.
[18:22:01] <eddiemonge> lonelybrownfox: any page you use jquery on needs to have it.
[18:22:07] <eddiemonge> vb.net lol
[18:22:45] <Turncoat> yeah, I'm going to actually go with C#, but I wanted to check out VB first, since I had never tried it.
[18:22:57] <eddiemonge> Turncoat: why either?
[18:23:01] <Turncoat> I know plenty of programming lanuages, :P
[18:23:19] <Turncoat> because I like the .NET framework, and C# is pretty awesome.
[18:23:56] <Turncoat> I'm working on my B.S. in Information Technology, with a concentration in .net web applications.
[18:25:13] <Eviltwin> Why do you say C# is awesome?
[18:25:25] <eddiemonge> why do you say you like the .NET framework?
[18:25:45] <eddiemonge> why do you hate the web so much?
[18:28:25] <someprimetime> why would you want to concentrate in a field of study that one company controls?
[18:28:36] <someprimetime> idk that is more #programmingpolitics
[18:29:17] <xp_prg> isn't microsoft floundering, they are losing revenue now right?
[18:29:22] <eddiemonge> same reason i refuse to contribute to wordpress
[18:29:34] <xp_prg> I like drupal
[18:29:42] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: not really. windows 8 looks awesome
[18:29:42] <webPragmatist> can i $.each backwards?
[18:29:46] <eddiemonge> drupal sucks too
[18:29:47] <webPragmatist> I have a json array
[18:29:52] <eddiemonge> but not as much as joomla
[18:29:57] <xp_prg> eddiemonge what is better than drupal?
[18:30:03] <eddiemonge> lol $.each backwards
[18:30:14] <xp_prg> eddiemonge why is win 8 better than the current ubuntu?
[18:30:21] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: what isnt, besides joomla?
[18:30:26] <webPragmatist> eddiemonge: what's so dang funny
[18:30:46] <someprimetime> hey Eviltwin, what do you suggest I do in the click functions to turn off infinite scroll within http://jsfiddle.net/K9EYk/14/ ?
[18:30:52] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: ubuntu is almost crap. and linux in general is so ugly to look at. no polish because no designers will use it
[18:31:01] <xp_prg> eddiemonge heressy!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[18:31:06] <eddiemonge> webPragmatist: why would you want to do it backwards? just reverse the array
[18:31:17] <xp_prg> I heart ubuntu and centos
[18:31:31] <xp_prg> I was surprised that centos had better driver discovery recently however
[18:31:33] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: linux is for programmers, not designers. if you dont spend half your time in cli then linux isnt really for you
[18:31:34] <someprimetime> seems like i could take the total number of elements from numElements and the current amount that moves, store the difference in a variable and when the variable equals the amount of numElements, then stop the animation ?
[18:31:50] <xp_prg> eddiemonge I heart cli
[18:31:58] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: you just named two of the worst distros
[18:32:05] <webPragmatist> just myArr.reverse ?
[18:32:36] <eddiemonge> webPragmatist: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reverse
[18:33:05] <someprimetime> i'd rather use an o/s created by passionate developers than designers who like things to be pretty
[18:33:20] <someprimetime> and i'm in a shell half of my time on a computer anyway so it's no biggie
[18:34:17] <eddiemonge> id rather use an OS that lets me drop into cli whenever i want but when im using the gui i want it to look clean and polished. pretty much the only reason im on mac osx now. its linux, but prettier
[18:34:34] <eddiemonge> and if i need more from my cli i can fire up a gui free linux vm
[18:35:08] <someprimetime> word
[18:36:22] <eddiemonge> although win8 is looking pretty good. too bad dos sucks so much
[18:38:20] <webPragmatist> i have a question...
[18:38:45] <webPragmatist> http://pastie.textmate.org/private/xeeeynva2olvkfvolleatw
[18:39:12] <webPragmatist> where last_entry='+ â€¦ is I need to basically pass a value from the prior request
[18:39:55] <webPragmatist> any idea how to do that?
[18:40:09] <webPragmatist> actually i have a brilliant id nevermind
[18:40:16] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: I'm not quite understanding
[18:41:59] <Aric> I'm having a problem with the jQuery.dataTables plugin, would I be able to get any help in here? or is this only for jQuery core?
[18:42:21] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: so within http://jsfiddle.net/K9EYk/14/ i set a variable called infinite to false. if it's true, it'll execute the current animation block within function rightClick() (right below var indent = cfirstâ€¦) otherwise, if set to false, it should only go as far as elements within the container (as to not shift any elements in either direction)â€¦
[18:42:47] <someprimetime> i'm trying to figure out the best way to go about writing this. any tips?
[18:43:23] <someprimetime> i was thinking within that else block inside of rightClick() to check to see how many elements there are total within the ul and then put some sort of a counter that increments each time right is clicked
[18:43:29] <Eviltwin> Probably the best place to make the substitution is where the calls to nextLoop and prevLoop happen
[18:43:36] <someprimetime> ok
[18:43:40] <someprimetime> perfect
[18:43:40] <someprimetime> thanks
[18:43:47] <Eviltwin> And switch them out with functions that don't loop back around
[18:43:52] <Eviltwin> If it's not infinite
[18:44:03] <someprimetime> ok right on much appreciated :)
[18:44:12] <Eviltwin> Keep in mind that the scrolling you're doing is changing the order of the items
[18:44:33] <someprimetime> right.
[18:44:37] <Eviltwin> If you want to preserve the order, that'll take a little more work
[19:05:42] <brylie> How do I remove() a page element after a chain of events, such as fadeOut()?
[19:06:34] <eddiemonge> call remove() in fadeOut()'s callback
[19:06:57] <brylie> fadeOut(1000,remove()); ?
[19:07:24] <eddiemonge> ?fadeout @ brylie
[19:07:24] <bot-t> brylie, .fadeOut([duration], [callback]): Hide the matched elements by fading them to transparent. http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/
[19:07:51] <brylie> Thanks eddiemonge :-)
[19:08:00] <optikalmouse> callback meaning another function. so it would be fadeOut(1000, removeMyElement) where removeMyElement has some random parameters ;p
[19:08:08] <optikalmouse> or you use an anonymous function...
[19:14:35] <heshanh> hey guys, anyone here used the multiselect plugin by erichynds?

[19:15:20] <heshanh> im trying to populat checkboxes using that plugin, i was wondering if theres a way to set some of them as checked
[19:21:58] <heshanh> nvm figured it out :D

[19:28:02] <coldhead> can you inspect those guys with your debugger?
[19:31:21] <whoever_> coldhead: its that i am using normal html buttons but included the jqm framework so that  i can havve fade in and out it did some weird shit check it out http://70.112.221.69 you can see the button text just to the left of the button
[19:31:56] <coldhead> that is weird
[19:32:21] <coldhead> whoever_: if you can wait until juha_ wakes up i'm sure he'll know
[19:32:36] <whoever_> coldhead whens that
[19:32:45] <coldhead> ?time helsinki
[19:32:47] <bot-t> coldhead, Helsinki, Uusimaa - Weather: Mostly Cloudy, -1°C / 30°F
[19:32:54] <coldhead> THAT IS THE WEATHER YOU STUPID BOT
[19:33:06] <optikalmouse> ?weather coldhead
[19:33:07] <xp_prg> I am trying to get the value from a selectToUISlider
[19:33:08] <bot-t> optikalmouse, Sydney, NSW - Weather: Clear, 25°C / 77°F
[19:33:09] <coldhead> it will be in about 2Â°C
[19:33:13] <whoever_> coldhead: it 9pm  in the states now
[19:33:15] <optikalmouse> coldhead: dude, you're Sydney.
[19:33:16] <optikalmouse> ;p
[19:33:21] <xp_prg> I am confused how to do that :(
[19:33:31] <coldhead> i knew that, optikalmouse!
[19:33:50] <coldhead> it's 5am in finland, whoever_
[19:34:00] <coldhead> you go ahead and keep asking meanwhile >: |
[19:34:03] <whoever_> coldhead: so what  time will juha gets up
[19:34:10] <coldhead> i'm not his mother
[19:34:16] <coldhead> 2 hours?
[19:34:24] <coldhead> depends how drunk he still is
[19:34:27] <coldhead> bloody vikings
[19:34:37] <whoever_> oh i heard that you were his mother ... lol
[19:35:42] <whoever_> coldhead: so now i gotta see if the ol ball and chain will let me stay up
[19:36:15] <iamjarvo> why would you pick .bind('click' fuction()â€¦) over .click(function()..)
[19:36:44] <systemfault> I prefer on :P
[19:36:56] <iamjarvo> well on is the newest syntax right
[19:37:05] <systemfault> Right.
[19:37:24] <iamjarvo> i am trying to figure out the difference though
[19:37:29] <iamjarvo> or the advantages
[19:37:49] <systemfault> iamjarvo: .on replace bind/delegate/live
[19:38:22] <xp_prg> oh figured it out! :>
[19:38:27] <systemfault> So you can just use .on and forget the rest :P
[19:38:33] <iamjarvo> systemfault:  i mean .on vs .click
[19:38:49] <iamjarvo> why would you use .on and not .click
[19:39:33] <systemfault> iamjarvo: I kind of like the DSL-ish nature of .on
[19:39:50] <systemfault> But yeah.. .click is a shortcut
[19:39:53] <iamjarvo> o ok
[19:40:43] <optikalmouse> is there a list of things I can do in jquery as practice? like what standard things are needed on a website that I can implement?
[19:40:55] * optikalmouse needs to refresh his jquery knowledge...
[19:41:28] <systemfault> optikalmouse: Learn and understand the difference between "normal event handling" and "event delegation"
[19:41:51] <systemfault> And the use cases for one and the other...
[19:42:05] <systemfault> Also.. when to use .attr and .prop
[19:43:21] <iamjarvo> systemfault:  thanks
[19:45:13] <Damianos> I know this is more of a php thing but the php channel is not very productive right now (flame war) so I thought I'd ask here. Anybody know how to get $.post()  to work when requesting from a subdomain?
[19:45:58] <optikalmouse> Damianos: use /ignore and encourage others to do the same, kills a lot of flame wars ;]
[19:46:24] <systemfault> Damianos: XHR don't work cross-domain
[19:46:31] <systemfault> *requests
[19:46:56] <Damianos> that's a bummer
[19:47:43] <Damianos> So annoying since the server address and the remote address is the same.
[19:47:57] <systemfault> Damianos: Perhaps you could hack it with a iframe transport using a form.
[19:48:12] <Damianos> yeah, I suppose
[19:52:09] <pringlescan> Hello all, I'm having a weird issue where a .each(function(){}) can't assign values to a global array, however, when I test it with typeof in the same scope, it says it's an objectâ€¦ I'm quite perplexed. Any ideas?
[19:52:40] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ pringlescan
[19:52:40] <bot-t> pringlescan, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[19:52:56] <coldhead> tangibly!
[19:54:12] <Damianos> ok, iframe it is...thanks a lot systemfault. You've been a great help.
[19:54:20] <systemfault> :)
[19:54:25] <systemfault> You're welcome
[19:55:26] <pringlescan> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/fBa7v/3/
[19:56:20] <Eviltwin> ?alert @ pringlescan
[19:56:20] <bot-t> pringlescan, Forget alertâ€”use console.log() in Firebug (or your browserâ€™s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[19:56:23] <Eviltwin> Fix it now
[19:56:59] <systemfault> The 90s called... they want their debug alert()s back
[19:57:03] <coldhead> that sure is a lot of alerts
[19:57:05] <pringlescan> fixed
[19:57:13] <pringlescan> I had it commentedâ€¦ I thought
[19:57:26] <coldhead> would you like to hear the lecture about document.write, too?
[19:57:42] <coldhead> the 90s called... they want their document.write back
[19:58:01] <pringlescan> This is debug codeâ€¦ that I have to show to my boss in a video, so document.write() is helpful for my purposes.
[19:58:16] <coldhead> oh good
[19:58:27] <Eviltwin> document.write can screw things up
[19:58:30] <Eviltwin> Don't use it
[19:58:35] <pringlescan> really?
[19:58:38] <coldhead> succinct
[19:58:48] <Eviltwin> You can do something like $("<div>").html(...).appendTo("#output") or something like that
[19:59:17] <pringlescan> I'm doing an awful lot of document.write() maybe I killed something
[19:59:28] <optikalmouse> don't do it.
[19:59:37] <pringlescan> isMurderer returned false
[20:00:09] <systemfault> The 90s called.... again, they want their document.write()s
[20:04:46] <pringlescan> http://jsfiddle.net/bC8SM/2/ <â€” console.log() still the same problem
[20:05:26] <Eviltwin> What is that problem exactly?
[20:05:39] <Eviltwin> Also
[20:05:42] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ pringlescan
[20:05:43] <bot-t> pringlescan, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[20:07:30] <pringlescan> I can access search_keyword_indexes from the .each() function @99 but by line 121 I can't access itâ€¦ I'm not sure why, I don't clear it...
[20:08:00] <Eviltwin> This doesn't show me line numbers
[20:09:45] <pringlescan> okay, let me rephrase my question, at any level of nested function, should anything in the global scope go out of scope if I'm not using namespaces or any funny business?
[20:10:33] <Eviltwin> If you re-var, it does
[20:10:48] <Eviltwin> But I think your problem is misusing arrays
[20:11:31] <Eviltwin> How is search_keyword_indexes used exactly?
[20:12:47] <Eviltwin> Are you still with us?
[20:14:05] <IanWizard-Cloud> I cannot seem to find a decent drag event plugin :(
[20:14:17] <IanWizard-Cloud> jquery UI seems a bit... unnecessary.
[20:14:26] <IanWizard-Cloud> I found one, but it doesn't really work well.
[20:14:43] <webPragmatist> should this work .. $.getJSON('http://mydomain.com/api/social_json/' + $('#foo').attr('id') â€¦
[20:14:49] <webPragmatist> sucessfully tack on the id?
[20:15:53] <xp_prg> anyone have experience with the selectToUISlider?
[20:17:11] <pringlescan> EvilTwin, search_keyword_indexes I made global because I thought because it was instead an anonymous function was why my code couldn't access it. I know better though, I'm not sure why I can't access it. I think maybe I'm exceeding a memory limit or something.
[20:17:37] <Eviltwin> pringlescan: My question isn't why it is where it is, my question is what purpose does it serve?
[20:18:04] <Eviltwin> webPragmatist: It'll tack on "foo" in that case
[20:18:10] <danzik17> pringlescan: re: mem-leak ...doubtful.  unless you're exceeding around 200MB in var.  then maybe.
[20:18:13] <pringlescan> search_keyword_indexes are the indexes of the keywords passed to the article function, since this will be going over the wire rather then store the keywords for each article, I used indexes
[20:18:28] <Eviltwin> So what kind of mapping is it?
[20:18:47] <Eviltwin> Were you a PHP developer perchance?
[20:19:04] <pringlescan> *Bends over*
[20:19:19] <pringlescan> Kick me, but help me afterwards, please.
[20:19:39] <Eviltwin> Are you trying to use search_keyword_indexes as an associative array?
[20:19:49] <Eviltwin> i.e. not a list of ordered values
[20:20:30] <Eviltwin> But rather a key-value lookup
[20:20:40] <pringlescan> Nope
[20:20:55] <pringlescan> The only reason I even store the word in there is so I can say which keywords it matches eventually
[20:21:07] <Eviltwin> search_keyword_indexes[value] = keyword_index;
[20:21:09] <pringlescan> I didn't want to make a keyword_index_lookup because it'd be very expensive to search through the array values
[20:21:12] <codemagician> Is jquery.ui.position.js already included in jquery-ui.js please?
[20:21:16] <Eviltwin> What is value in that context?
[20:22:10] <pringlescan> value is the keyword, because I wanted to see what words were being passed, I'm not trying to use it as a key-value store, because I don't actually use the word to access the array
[20:23:01] <pringlescan> if you think not passing the word will fix it, there's something else wrong because this not working is why I started passing the word, because I didn't know where it was failing.
[20:24:12] <Eviltwin> I'm not understanding the flow
[20:24:23] <Guest99763> coldhead: got it woking
[20:25:37] <coldhead> good work Guest99763!
[20:25:42] <coldhead> stand down, juha_
[20:25:45] <coldhead> keep drinking
[20:25:52] <Eviltwin> Okay, so I set a breakpoint
[20:26:02] <Eviltwin> And value is "happen" and keyword_index is 172
[20:26:12] <Eviltwin> And you do search_keyword_indexes[value] = keyword_index
[20:26:26] <StevenCodes22> How would I execute jquery through an input ?
[20:26:33] <pringlescan> I will be passing a JSON object with articles, storing that in local storage, and then searching it locally.
[20:26:37] <Eviltwin> Isn't that for the purposes of doing search_keyword_indexes["happen"] at a later date?
[20:26:46] <Eviltwin> To find the index?
[20:27:08] <pringlescan> the keywords aren't important, it's only for showing the article, which will contain that keyword
[20:27:32] <Eviltwin> What is the purpose of search_keyword_indexes?
[20:27:48] <Eviltwin> Is there one?
[20:27:55] <pringlescan> we do 3 checks, on the path, user_role and category. those are either hit or miss, they can only have one value.
[20:28:41] <coldhead> my god you're a patient saint, Eviltwin
[20:28:57] <pringlescan> the keywords object of each article is an array of indexesâ€¦ the search_keyword_indexes takes the array of strings we pass the function, and creates an array of indexes so we can compare the two
[20:29:14] <StevenCodes22> Anyway to run jquery through an input ?
[20:29:32] <systemfault> StevenCodes22: That doesn't mean anything.
[20:29:59] <StevenCodes22> Yeah it does I have a code $('#book').animate({width: 'toggle',height: 'toggle'}" and I want to execute it through an input
[20:30:00] <Eviltwin> pringlescan: So what are you trying to accomplish with search_keyword_indexes[value] = keyword_index?
[20:30:06] <gnarf> hey coldhead, whats the bot-t factoid for what systemfault just said?
[20:30:11] <pringlescan> so, search_keyword_indexes are the keywords we get as an argument, converted from an array of strings to an array of indexesâ€¦
[20:30:14] <Eviltwin> Which for this run is doing search_keyword_indexes["happen"] = 172;
[20:30:28] <gnarf> StevenCodes22: define "execute through an input"
[20:30:49] <Eviltwin> If I have an empty array []
[20:30:52] <StevenCodes22> gnarf Have this code $('#book').animate({width: 'toggle',height: 'toggle'}" and want to execute it when I push enter on a input
[20:30:59] <pringlescan> eviltwin, I tried it out of desperation, I was originally .push(keyword_index) onto the array, but my code didn't work, so I tried this instead.
[20:31:00] <Eviltwin> And I call it search_keyword_indexes
[20:31:13] <Eviltwin> What do you think search_keyword_indexes["happen"] = 172; does?
[20:31:14] <gnarf> StevenCodes22: any input, or just one of them
[20:31:19] <StevenCodes22> gnarf just one
[20:31:21] <gnarf> i.e. - on form submission?
[20:31:24] <Eviltwin> What does the array look like after?
[20:31:40] <pringlescan> it should have one item, 'happen' with a value of 172.
[20:31:51] <StevenCodes22> Yeah but how would I make it change the code to actually run it
[20:31:52] <StevenCodes22> lol
[20:32:00] <StevenCodes22> instead of it just being a string
[20:32:12] <Eviltwin> pringlescan: So let's say I wanted to get that one item without using $.each
[20:32:13] <Eviltwin> What would I do?
[20:32:15] <gnarf> StevenCodes22: so you want to bind an event handler see  ?.keypress on the input and and check e.which for ENTER's keycode
[20:32:16] <bot-t> StevenCodes22, .keypress(handler): Bind an event handler to the "keypress" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/keypress/
[20:32:53] <pringlescan> var len = search_keyword_indexes.length; while(lenâ€”) { â€¦ do something with search_keyword_indexes[len]; }
[20:33:05] <pringlescan> I was told that was the fastest way to loop through an array, it is also the ugliest.
[20:33:06] <xp_prg> figured it out!!!
[20:33:14] <coldhead> ?hi5 @ xp_prg
[20:33:14] <bot-t> xp_prg, â‹°âµâ‹±
[20:33:16] <StevenCodes22> gnarf I already have all that just what do I need to tell it to change the code to a string ?
[20:33:25] <StevenCodes22> string to code*
[20:33:35] <Eviltwin> pringlescan: I think you don't understand the data structures in JavaScript
[20:33:49] <gnarf> StevenCodes22: um, define "change the string to code"
[20:33:51] <systemfault> pringlescan: Have you ever heard: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil"? P
[20:34:02] <systemfault> *:P
[20:34:32] <Eviltwin> pringlescan: There are two data structures in JavaScript, one is called an object, one is called an array
[20:34:36] <pringlescan> â€¦ I work somewhere that used Drupal and a custom MySQL zipcode distant calculation function instead of a Geo Spatial database and I pay for it everyday. I try to optimize everything nowâ€¦
[20:34:56] <pringlescan> An array is a simple type with methods, right?
[20:35:07] <StevenCodes22> gnarf when I put the value being "$('#book').animate({width: 'toggle',height: 'toggle'}" into the html input how would i grab it and make it run
[20:35:08] <Eviltwin> In JavaScript Object Notation, they look like this: http://json.org/object.gif and http://json.org/array.gif
[20:35:24] <gnarf> StevenCodes22: OMG EVIL
[20:35:30] <gnarf> ?mdn eval
[20:35:32] <bot-t> gnarf, Security best practices in extensions - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Security_best_practices_in_extensions
[20:35:41] <Eviltwin> So { "foo": 12, "bar": 42 } is an object
[20:35:54] <Eviltwin> And [ "foo", 12, "bar", 42 ] is an array
[20:35:58] <StevenCodes22> Im confused
[20:35:59] <StevenCodes22> ?
[20:36:03] <pringlescan> Eviltwin, those are the train diagrams from "Javascript the good parts" I can't make heads or tails of them, I'm retarded at reading them.
[20:36:10] <pringlescan> What you just said makes sense, I get that part.
[20:36:12] <gnarf> StevenCodes22: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval
[20:36:39] <StevenCodes22> gnarf Gotcha thanks man lol sorry I didnt know how to make any cleaer
[20:36:42] <gnarf> StevenCodes22: alternatively
[20:36:50] <Eviltwin> So let's say the object was in a var "o" and the array was in a var "a"
[20:36:54] <Eviltwin> What's o.length?
[20:36:57] <xp_prg>  $("#maxNYB option").last().attr("selected", true);
[20:37:04] <pringlescan> o doesn't have a length
[20:37:05] <gnarf> StevenCodes22: you can create a <script> tag, and set its text
[20:37:05] <xp_prg> this is part of a select input element
[20:37:10] <Eviltwin> Correct
[20:37:13] <gnarf> StevenCodes22: google around about it
[20:37:17] <xp_prg> but I don't understand what is happening, can you help me understand it?
[20:37:17] <Eviltwin> So it's undefined
[20:37:19] <Eviltwin> What's a.length?
[20:37:27] <gnarf> StevenCodes22: but its considered "evil" - i assume you are just making something ot play with
[20:37:29] <pringlescan> 2 because it's a method in the simple type array right?
[20:37:33] <gnarf> but you should check out ?jsfiddle
[20:37:37] <gnarf> ?jsfiddle
[20:37:38] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[20:37:49] <Eviltwin> Remember, a is [ "foo", 12, "bar", 42 ]
[20:37:52] <gnarf> perhaps also http://jsconsole.com
[20:37:59] <pringlescan> shit
[20:38:00] <pringlescan> 4
[20:38:07] <Eviltwin> Okay
[20:38:10] <Eviltwin> Right
[20:38:24] <Eviltwin> Now let's say I do a[4] = "xyz";
[20:38:27] <Eviltwin> What's a.length?
[20:38:32] <Eviltwin> After that
[20:38:36] <pringlescan> â€¦ that's going to be a problem
[20:38:42] <pringlescan> because we didn't start at 0
[20:38:50] <pringlescan> right?
[20:38:57] <Eviltwin> We didn't start at 0?
[20:38:59] <pringlescan> well, it's still 1 I think
[20:39:02] <Eviltwin> What do you mean
[20:39:27] <pringlescan> I don't know how smart length is, it might just check for [0] and if it's not there return -1
[20:39:38] <Eviltwin> Well what would a[0] be?
[20:39:42] <gnarf> ?101
[20:39:42] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[20:39:45] <pringlescan> undefined
[20:39:51] <Eviltwin> No...
[20:40:00] <Eviltwin> a[0] would be "foo"
[20:40:14] <Eviltwin> ?eval var a = [ "foo", 12, "bar", 42 ]; a[0]
[20:40:17] <bot-t> Eviltwin: "foo"
[20:40:18] <pringlescan> Sorry, I thought we started over.
[20:41:13] <pringlescan> I wasn't considering our earlier code.
[20:41:23] <Eviltwin> Okay
[20:41:28] <Eviltwin> Anyway what's a[1] in this case?
[20:41:34] <pringlescan> 12
[20:41:38] <Eviltwin> And a[4]?
[20:41:45] <pringlescan> xyz I think you said
[20:41:55] <Eviltwin> Right, after I do a[4] = "xyz"
[20:42:04] <Eviltwin> And what's a.length after that?
[20:42:05] <gnarf> or a.push( "xyz" )
[20:42:14] <theBrettman> is there anyway to use javascript in a way to edit stylesheets independant of the browser?
[20:42:17] <pringlescan> 4
[20:42:23] <gnarf> 5
[20:42:23] <xp_prg> yes!!!!
[20:42:26] <Eviltwin> No, it's actually 5 now
[20:42:28] <xp_prg> I am figuring it out again :>
[20:42:35] <Eviltwin> We've added an element by doing that
[20:42:37] <pringlescan> really? it counts from 1 instead of 0
[20:42:43] <pringlescan> that's always pissed me off
[20:42:48] <Eviltwin> What?
[20:42:50] <gnarf> arrays define from [0..length-1]
[20:42:58] <Eviltwin> We started with [ "foo", 12, "bar", 42 ]
[20:43:10] <Eviltwin> We did a[4] = "xyz"
[20:43:15] <pringlescan> I don't think PERL did that, so I got used to accounting for it.
[20:43:19] <gnarf> length !== last index
[20:43:29] <Eviltwin> So the array is now [ "foo", 12, "bar", 42, "xyz" ] essentailly
[20:43:46] <pringlescan> okay
[20:44:05] <theBrettman> is there anyway to use javascript in a way to edit stylesheets independant of the browser?
[20:44:23] <Eviltwin> Now the problem is if I do something like a["hello"] = 12;
[20:44:30] <Eviltwin> That actually works just fine
[20:44:37] <Eviltwin> And if later I do a["hello"]
[20:44:38] <Eviltwin> I get back 12
[20:44:48] <pringlescan> theBrettman, check out CSSLess it might do the job
[20:44:49] <Eviltwin> Because arrays are actually a subclass of objects
[20:44:52] <pringlescan> I can't iterate over it though?
[20:44:56] <Eviltwin> But the length isn't going to change
[20:45:05] <Eviltwin> You can but it usually doesn't make sense to
[20:45:07] <pringlescan> Oh! Shit, so I'm storing them in the object, because Array inherits object.
[20:45:19] <Eviltwin> Objects and arrays are usually iterated different ways
[20:45:39] <Eviltwin> If you're manipulating a list, I suggest you use push/shift/pop/unshift
[20:45:47] <Eviltwin> To add/remove from the beginning/end
[20:45:47] <gnarf> ? var a=[]; a["bob"] = "hey"; a.length
[20:45:48] <bot-t> gnarf, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[20:45:53] <gnarf> ?js var a=[]; a["bob"] = "hey"; a.length
[20:45:56] <bot-t> gnarf: 0
[20:46:04] <pringlescan> I'll try that again, but it didn't seem to be workingâ€¦ I prefer that notation though for the code I'm having problems with.
[20:46:06] <Eviltwin> And only use the []'s to read or change existing elements
[20:46:18] <gnarf> ?js var a=[]; a["bob"] = "hey"; a.bob
[20:46:20] <bot-t> gnarf: "hey"
[20:46:35] <Eviltwin> When you do things like search_keyword_indexes["happen"] = 172;
[20:46:52] <Eviltwin> It's not getting added to the array the way you think it is
[20:47:13] <Eviltwin> search_keyword_indexes[i] isn't going to get that value for any integer i
[20:47:25] <Eviltwin> Which is what happens when you're doing the while(len--) or whatever
[20:47:40] <Eviltwin> You're visiting integers
[20:47:40] <pringlescan> So, if I wanted to do that search_keyword_indexes = {value, key} and I'd have to iterate over it and pull out the key or value that I need
[20:47:55] <gnarf> ?js var a=[]; a.push({ keyword: "happen", count: 172 }); console.log( a[0].keyword, a[0].count );
[20:47:58] <bot-t> gnarf: "happen" 172
[20:48:00] <Eviltwin> If instead of var search_keyword_indexes = [], you do var search_keyword_indexes = {}
[20:48:05] <Eviltwin> It's treated as an object
[20:48:12] <Eviltwin> And you can iterate over the arbitrary keys
[20:48:29] <Eviltwin> And object is called a hash in Perl
[20:49:03] <Eviltwin> But unlike Perl, you can't just freely switch between the two
[20:49:41] <Eviltwin> http://andrewdupont.net/2006/05/18/javascript-associative-arrays-considered-harmful/
[20:49:42] <gnarf> if you don't care about "length" and just want to iterate, use {} anyway
[20:49:46] <Eviltwin> Read that for more information
[20:49:57] <pringlescan> I gotchaâ€¦ I still think I broke something else besides totally messing this up, because whether it's an array, object, whatever, I still can't access that variable from my code.
[20:50:56] <Eviltwin> You're problem is you're doing a whole bunch of search_keyword_indexes[<word>] = <index>
[20:51:08] <Eviltwin> And the whole time search_keyword_indexes.length remains 0
[20:51:28] <Eviltwin> So when you try to loop over the elements, there's nothing to loop over
[20:51:47] <Eviltwin> Because you (and $.each) do a loop like for(var i = 0; i < search_keyword_indexes.length; i++) { ... }
[20:51:58] <Eviltwin> Which will loop exactly 0 times because length is 0
[20:52:18] <Eviltwin> If it were an object, $.each would automatically loop over the keys using for(var k in search_keyword_indexes) { ... }
[20:52:39] <Eviltwin> At which point it would visit each word you added
[20:52:49] <Eviltwin> And be able to look up the index by doing search_keyword_indexes[k]
[20:53:17] <Eviltwin> And this is why we tell people to see ?learn

[20:58:22] <IanWizard-Cloud> gnarf: yes.
[20:58:33] <gnarf> IanWizard-Cloud: cool

[20:59:32] <gnarf> ?twss
[20:59:33] <bot-t1> <iainvdw> was fiddling with it for a while, got close a few times, but didn't do exaclty what i wanted, thx!
[21:00:00] <IanWizard-Cloud> Eviltwin: I've done it by hand in pure JS, but there must be some good plugin for it.
[21:00:02] <Eviltwin> If you're looking for something more sophisticated that than, while jQuery UI has weight, their dragging is rather well-implemented and pluggable
[21:00:16] <Eviltwin> Like mixing it with sortables
[21:00:42] <gnarf> IanWizard-Cloud: drag & drop, or just drag?
[21:00:56] <Eviltwin> IanWizard-Cloud: Have you seen all the examples here? http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[21:01:24] <IanWizard-Cloud> Eviltwin: tbh, I've already go UI on the site (to my shagrin), but the draggable seems.. less than ideal.
[21:01:31] <IanWizard-Cloud> gnarf: just drag.
[21:01:39] <IanWizard-Cloud> Eviltwin: I'll look at UI further I guess.
[21:01:41] <Eviltwin> Thanks, (I'm presuming) pringlescan
[21:01:54] <Eviltwin> IanWizard-Cloud: Look at the examples on those pages
[21:01:59] <Eviltwin> Pretty impressive stuff
[21:02:01] <pringlescan> Eviltwin, you'll never know for sure.

[21:03:14] <Eviltwin> gnarf: Not yet, no
[21:03:15] <Eviltwin> Promising?
[21:03:23] <gnarf> Eviltwin: i think so
[21:03:36] <Eviltwin> I'll take a peek when I have a chance
[21:03:41] <Eviltwin> But that's not now
[21:03:47] <Eviltwin> I should have gone to sleep half an hour ago

[21:04:08] <Eviltwin> But pringlescan needed arrays and objects explained
[21:05:55] <pringlescan> Pringlescan also opened up "Javascript: The Definitive Guide" the 6th edition and the FIRST THING HE READ (page 127) had an error on it
[21:06:22] <pringlescan> it had hasOwnProperty[blah] instead of hasOwnProperty(blah)
[21:06:31] <pringlescan> which is super easy to make, but you think they'd check that stuff

[21:06:58] <Eviltwin> Is that any more helpful?
[21:07:00] <pringlescan> I just kept making sure I had what was in the book instead of actually reading it, which is when I figured it out, because ofcourse that's not a syntax error.
[21:07:14] <pringlescan> I'll check it out, usually O'Reilly books are good.
[21:07:18] <Eviltwin> IanWizard-Cloud: Central but I have to be up pretty early

[21:08:09] <IanWizard-Cloud> Eviltwin: Tx?
[21:08:12] <pringlescan> we should leave russia alone so nginx can grow stronger and stronger
[21:08:13] <snover> StevenCodes22: russia is off-topic in #jquery.
[21:08:33] <Eviltwin> IanWizard-Cloud: Hmm?
[21:08:35] <StevenCodes22> snover wont matter if they nuke us saaay what

[21:15:55] <abjorn> hm, wonder what's going on. there's like a fleet of cops in my apartment complex. flashing lights everywhere
[21:16:03] <IanWizard-Cloud> Who'd be shocked if I actually opped up?
[21:16:06] <gnarf> abjorn: hide the drugs
[21:16:12] <abjorn> gnarf: way ahead of you
[21:16:29] <vladikoff> abjorn, you have 10 seconds to get out, there's a blue van parked at the north exit

[21:23:17] <gnarf> i missed your freenode 7'th birthday
[21:23:21] * gnarf frowns
[21:24:02] <xp_prg> hi all, I am trying to figure out how to invoke this stop function in the selectToUISlider object: http://jsfiddle.net/renXW/3/
[21:24:05] <xp_prg> anyone have any ideas?
[21:24:52] <gnarf> xp_prg: yeah, your jQuery versions are SUPER low
[21:25:22] <xp_prg> this doesn't work: $('#privs').trigger('change');
[21:25:43] <gnarf> trigger sliderstrop
[21:25:46] <snover> gnarf: so you did
[21:25:59] <snover> also boy am I old
[21:26:00] <xp_prg> gnarf how do I trigger it?
[21:26:15] <gnarf> xp_prg: honestly though, why do you want to do that?
[21:26:31] <gnarf> like whats the use case?
[21:26:54] <gnarf> you might be better off defining the function outside of that and referencing it inside of the stop event
[21:27:20] <xp_prg> gnarf I am testing a web page
[21:27:23] <xp_prg> I am checking if it works
[21:27:33] <gnarf> xp_prg: unit testing?
[21:29:10] <gnarf> that stop event is called in response to a mouseup on the slider
[21:29:20] <gnarf> or kepress
[21:29:46] <gnarf> but like i said before
[21:29:48] <xp_prg> I am open to suggestions how to do that
[21:29:59] <gnarf> xp_prg: if this is ONLY testing
[21:31:15] <xp_prg> ideas?
[21:32:30] <xp_prg> gnarf what is the best way to trigger the event?
[21:34:15] <joshsmith> maybe I'm being retarded, but I'm trying to figure out a way to take an element from a ul, html and all, remove it from the list, and place it at the beginning
[21:34:16] <gnarf> xp_prg:     $('#privs').next().data('slider')._stop();
[21:34:20] <gnarf> debug ONLY
[21:34:23] <joshsmith> you guys know of any way I can do that?
[21:34:29] <gnarf> if i catch you doing that in production I'll scream
[21:34:44] <joshsmith> I only really need to know if it's possible to grab that entire elements HTML
[21:35:19] <joshsmith> I know that $('elem') creates an object, but is that the same as its HTML?
[21:35:41] <joshsmith> or should I do .html()?
[21:36:02] <xp_prg> gnarf says undefined  $('#privs').next().data('slider')._stop();
[21:36:29] <xp_prg> http://jsfiddle.net/renXW/4/
[21:36:33] <gnarf> xp_prg: http://jsfiddle.net/renXW/5/
[21:37:26] <xp_prg> can you help me to make this work on my changed example?
[21:37:36] <xp_prg> by the way can you help me to understand why yours works at all? :>
[21:37:50] <joshsmith> okay, so .html() gets all of the contained elements
[21:38:06] <joshsmith> is there any way to get the content *including* the selector
[21:38:10] <palani> hi hi
[21:38:13] <palani> gud morning
[21:38:43] <gnarf> xp_prg: that thing is insane
[21:38:52] <palani> Am new for jquery
[21:38:53] <gnarf> sliderToUISlider is horrid
[21:39:00] <xp_prg> gnarf it definitely is
[21:39:18] <gnarf> it doesn't store a reference to the slider it makes on the original input at all
[21:39:19] <palani> How To Use jQuery Event Handling on html.......plzz any 1 help me
[21:39:43] <xp_prg> gnarf I am just trying to understand how you would even know that
[21:39:55] <xp_prg> what irritates me to know end is why I can't use trigger
[21:40:06] <gnarf> xp_prg: cuz the events aren't attached to #privs
[21:40:08] <xp_prg> know = no
[21:40:11] <gnarf> #privs is hidden
[21:40:23] <gnarf> so its like that div.ui-slider:first
[21:40:54] <xp_prg> sorry what?
[21:41:26] <gnarf> xp_prg: it replaces #privs with a div
[21:41:30] <gnarf> that has a slider in it
[21:41:37] <gnarf> thats the thing that you have to trigger slidestop on
[21:41:52] <gnarf> but like if your event depends on the ui hash
[21:41:52] <xp_prg> oh ok cool!!!
[21:41:57] <gnarf> its gonna bug out anyway
[21:42:16] <gnarf> you have to have UI trigger that event
[21:42:50] <gnarf> i still don't know why you'd need to trigger that event
[21:43:03] <gnarf> if you made it a named function you could just call it....
[21:43:04] <xp_prg> $('#nyb_slider').slider('option','slide').call($('#nyb_slider'),null,{ handle: $('.ui-slider-handle',$('#nyb_slider')), values: [166, $('#nyb_slider').slider('values', 1)] });
[21:43:30] <xp_prg> I did this for a regular slider to call the slide function in the slider object
[21:43:44] <xp_prg> gnarf I don't have the ability to refactor the code :(
[21:44:12] <xp_prg> gnarf so do you know how I can make the UI trigger that event?
[21:44:28] <gnarf> xp_prg: http://jsfiddle.net/renXW/6/
[21:44:49] <gnarf> but like its not very correct
[21:45:03] <StevenCodes22> How would i check if position is greeater then 500 using .position()
[21:45:34] <xp_prg> gnarf can you help me to understand it, I don't know why it works at all
[21:46:40] <gnarf> .data("slider") is the actual INSTANCE of the ui slider widget
[21:46:44] <gnarf> and you call _stop() on it
[21:46:55] <snover> lol wut
[21:47:01] <gnarf> snover: lol
[21:47:04] <xp_prg> gnarf but what is nextAll?
[21:47:12] <gnarf> xp_prg: see ?nextAll
[21:47:13] <bot-t1> xp_prg, .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[21:47:37] <gnarf> since the slider is appended to the same parent as the select
[21:47:42] <gnarf> yu can nextAll() to it
[21:47:47] <xp_prg> oh ok cool
[21:48:04] <xp_prg> how did you know it was appended in that way, did you use firebug and the dom viewer?
[21:48:14] <gnarf> chrome inspector
[21:50:12] <xp_prg> is there a way for me to know that using the console or firebug dom viewer?
[21:50:17] <xp_prg> I am just trying to learn how to do this better :>
[21:51:20] <gnarf> like inspect the slider, its div.ui-slider is after the #privs
[21:52:04] <xp_prg> I see them on the same level
[21:52:19] <gnarf> right, its a "sibiling"
[21:52:28] <gnarf> but its not RIGHT after
[21:52:36] <xp_prg> hmm... ok
[21:52:37] <gnarf> so nextAll instead of just next
[21:52:47] <xp_prg> how did you know that slider was a data member?
[21:52:57] <gnarf> xp_prg: i'm on the jquery-ui team
[21:53:09] <gnarf> so i know that a slider widget will have data('slider')
[21:53:17] <gnarf> cuz thats how the widget factoy works
[21:53:28] <gnarf> but you can look at .data()
[21:53:31] <gnarf> and traverse it
[21:53:42] <xp_prg> I wish I could know of a way to find this stuff out, in python I would use introspection to determine what the object has inside of it
[21:53:54] <xp_prg> dir() etc...
[21:54:13] <gnarf> just $("#privs").nextAll("div.ui-slider").data()
[21:55:22] <xp_prg> in firebug console on jsfiddle I try this: $("#privs").nextAll("div.ui-slider").data() and it says $("#prvis") is null
[21:55:30] <xp_prg> I wish I knew why
[21:55:41] <gnarf> xp_prg: are you executing in the result frame/
[21:55:55] <xp_prg> I don't know even how to do that
[21:55:57] <gnarf> but like anyway, i think your jQuery ight be so old that .data() doesn't work well
[21:56:21] <gnarf> xp_prg: in google chrome's console, there is a "frame selector" near the clear / etc buttons
[21:56:27] <gnarf> i dunno firebug
[21:56:53] <xp_prg> gnarf I am surprised you like google chrome over firebug
[21:57:15] <gnarf> xp_prg: i'm not, its JS tools are 100 times better imo
[21:57:33] <xp_prg> gnarf one more quick question, I am interested in making a 3d game in jquery, can you recommend a gpl'd library for doing that?
[21:57:44] <gnarf> xp_prg: no
[21:58:07] <gnarf> ?g newgameconf
[21:58:09] <bot-t1> gnarf, New Game - The conference for HTML5 game developers - http://www.newgameconf.com/
[21:58:27] <xp_prg> is it because you don't know if one exists or there isn't one?
[21:58:30] <xp_prg> just curious :>
[21:59:09] <webPragmatist> can i get a count of all of the hrefs in a collection that have a specific href?
[21:59:14] <webPragmatist> anchors*
[21:59:26] <gnarf> xp_prg: im sure there are a few, and most of them proabaly suck
[22:00:08] <xp_prg> ya that is what I thought
[22:01:20] <gnarf> http://thejacklawson.com/2011/11/new-game-conf-liveblog/index.html
[22:02:35] <xp_prg> well thanks for your time gnarf, forgive me if I took too much of your time :>
[22:03:37] <xp_prg> well have a good night, bye :>
[22:05:25] <Patabugen> Is there a specific way to call jQuery UI? Similar to using jQuery instead of $
[22:05:46] <Patabugen> I'm creating a dialog which works fine in the console, but from within another app it's not working
[22:16:02] <karega|aniasis> Any great raphael.js demos out there?
[22:16:58] <Cork> theres a lot on there site
[22:24:36] * coldhead np: rapeman - kim gordon's panties
[23:10:34] <skyl> if have a callback for $('select[name="foo"]').change( and then put another for $('form#bar').find('select').change(, do I know which one will fire first?
[23:28:24] <webPragmatist> how  can i do if new Date(2012, 1-1, 13, 06, 00, 00) < now() â€¦ i guessâ€¦ if a date has already occurred
[23:30:46] <chjj> webPragmatist: hmm?
[23:31:01] <chjj> dates are coerced into numbers if theyre compared with numbers, if thats what youre asking
[23:37:22] <webusnix> hi to all!
[23:37:28] <webusnix> i have a problem
[23:37:38] <webusnix> i have table
[23:38:21] <dr0id> I have font
[23:38:30] <PERECil_> I have a penis :D
[23:40:13] <webusnix> i rows of table store link and input
[23:41:28] <webusnix> http://pastebin.com/pwBYBbW2
[23:41:42] <webusnix> i want get input value when clicked on link
[23:41:47] <webusnix> how i can do that ?
[23:43:32] <Hesuz> <a href="#" onclick="alert($(".inp-kolvo").attr('value'));">MyLink</a>
[23:43:34] <Hesuz> for example
[23:43:38] <Hesuz> should work
[23:44:08] <Hesuz> webusnix, but i suggest you use something else than a link for this kind of functionality
