[00:07:42] <Genitrust> how do i remove all 'selected' items from a selection field ?
[00:17:37] <Tomashe> Hey guys im using leaflet map. inside a container <div class="container" .. the map apears live so i was using $("#container").find(".x").. the class name x apear in the live map but when i add click even on it $("#container").on("click",".x"...  nothing fired .. any ideas what could cause that?
[00:47:38] <fabioportieri> o/
[00:47:52] <Cork> \o
[00:53:17] <Tomashe> Hey guys. there is a reason why im using .on() live dom and it doesnt find me an object when i can see it clearly on firebug ?
[00:53:50] <Cork> Tomashe: are you using the delegate syntax for on?
[00:54:07] <Tomashe> just simple syntax
[00:54:28] <Cork> $('selector').on('event', func)?
[00:54:30] <Tomashe> Container.on("click",".user-icon",function(){console.log(1231312312);});
[00:54:33] <Cork> ok
[00:54:47] <Tomashe> user icon is in the DOM
[00:54:58] <Cork> do you have a link or a jsfiddle?
[00:55:05] <Tomashe> i dont have :/
[00:55:27] <Cork> and Container contains a parent?
[00:55:34] <Tomashe> im using leaflet with custom icons , and the icons/map constantly update on the dom
[00:55:53] <Tomashe> yes Containers is the main static container that everything changes inside
[00:56:11] <Cork> and console.log(Container.length) or > 0 ?
[00:56:22] <Tomashe> 1
[00:56:29] <Tomashe> its exist
[00:56:47] <Tomashe> other click events are working with same method
[00:56:48] <Cork> can only think of two other reasons
[00:57:00] <Cork> the element has direct handlers that do return false;
[00:57:09] <Cork> or the selector is wrong
[00:57:28] <Tomashe> the first option is actually sounds right
[00:57:39] <Tomashe> its leaflet (map) marker with my custom class
[00:57:54] <Tomashe> so there is a way to bypass the return false; ?
[01:00:47] <Cork> Tomashe: modify the event handler
[01:00:59] <Cork> Tomashe: delegate can't act on it cause the event never gets to the parent
[01:01:20] <Cork> Tomashe: only way to fix it is to fix the event listener killing the event
[01:01:38] <Cork> (and this is why you should never ever use return false; in event handlers)
[01:01:58] <Tomashe> i did not , its leaflet map
[01:02:11] <Cork> ya, i'm not accusing you .)
[01:02:40] <Tomashe> :)
[01:02:42] <Cork> Tomashe: but there is nothing you can do except either modify the script
[01:02:43] <Tomashe> thanks for the hints
[01:02:55] <Cork> or attach the event listeners directly to the element
[01:03:00] <Cork> hmm no
[01:03:06] <Cork> that last solution won't work either
[01:03:14] <Cork> as the other will exist first so you can't even do that
[01:04:10] <Tomashe> hmm
[01:36:42] <Parsi> i'm using chosen plugin inside a modal window, but it does not look well
[01:39:19] <Parsi> it's how it looks http://imgur.com/qqPf8HJ
[02:11:32] <tonythomas> I have two input text boxes sharing a common class say 'foo' , with a submit button ( common class 'bar') for each. I wanted to have the submit button wait till the user inputs something into the input box, and then then become enabled. I could do that for a single input box and button
[02:12:04] <tonythomas> but, when given multiple inputboxes and buttons, the code affects both simultaneously giving wrong results
[02:12:24] <tonythomas> Can $(this)->closest() solve this issue ?
[02:12:36] <Cork> tonythomas: no
[02:12:40] <Cork> closest look for parent
[02:12:53] <Cork> you want something like .nextAll('input').first()
[02:12:58] <Cork> if they are siblings that is
[02:13:08] <tonythomas> Cork:  I will paste the code.
[02:13:10] <Cork> but what you need depends on the dom structure
[02:13:37] <tonythomas> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/cPxaaXN2
[02:14:03] <tonythomas> the alert ( inputLength ) somehow gives me the exact length of each input box
[02:14:50] <Cork> tonythomas: the dom, not the js code
[02:14:58] <Cork> and please use jsfiddle or jsbin
[02:15:53] <tonythomas> Cork:  you meant you need to see how the form is created in DOM ?
[02:16:00] <Cork> yes
[02:17:35] <tonythomas> Cork:  its actually an extension for MediaWiki - and the code is cretead by parsing a string $htmlOut as in here
[02:17:36] <tonythomas> http://jsfiddle.net/S8mat/
[02:18:00] <Cork> tonythomas: inspect the page and copy the generated html for the form
[02:18:10] <tonythomas> Cork: ok
[02:18:12] <Cork> php doesn't help me
[02:19:09] <tonythomas> Cork:  updated at http://jsfiddle.net/S8mat/
[02:19:25] <Cork> click update
[02:19:40] <tonythomas> Cork:  sorry http://jsfiddle.net/S8mat/1/
[02:19:50] <tonythomas> Cork: thats the output when I created two inputboxes
[02:20:00] <Cork> ok
[02:20:30] <Cork> ok they are directly next to each other
[02:21:10] <Cork> so $('.createboxInput').next().prop('disabled', false);
[02:21:13] <Cork> should work
[02:21:45] <Cork> or more specifically $('.createboxInput').on('input', function() { $(this).next().prop('disabled', false); })
[02:22:22] <tonythomas> Cork:  Thanks. Let me try
[02:24:31] <tonythomas> Cork:  Yay! It worked. Thanks
[02:25:29] <Cork> tonythomas: and if you want you can do something like prop('disabled', $(this).val().length < 1);
[02:25:42] <Cork> and have it disable it self again if the field gets cleared
[02:27:03] <tonythomas> Cork: You mean to have just two lines ?
[02:27:15] <tonythomas> one: prop('disabled', $(this).val().length < 1);
[02:28:17] <Cork> instead of the prop call here $('.createboxInput').on('input', function() { $(this).next().prop('disabled', false); })
[02:29:09] <Cork> tonythomas: if you already solved it in a way you prefer, go that way :)
[02:29:36] <tonythomas> Cork:  no probs. I will try this way too. The lesser, the merrier :)
[02:31:02] <tonythomas> Cork:  but once it get backs to 0, I need to have it disabled again
[02:31:12] <tonythomas> so this should go to an if-else ?
[02:31:59] <Cork>  prop('disabled', $(this).val().length < 1) should handle that
[02:34:16] <Cork> tonythomas: http://jsfiddle.net/4gxuU/
[02:35:16] <noobienoob> Hi. I'm trying to understand some of the syntax/usage for characters in jQuery for a Codecademy mini course.
[02:37:40] <Cork> ?ask
[02:37:40] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:38:29] <noobienoob> can you explain the use of ( vs [ in the basic basic syntax?
[02:38:54] <Cork> noobienoob: it's basic js, and works the same as all c like languages
[02:39:07] <Cork> () is for arguments to functions mainly
[02:39:16] <Cork> and grouping equations and things like that
[02:39:20] <Cork> [] is arrays
[02:39:31] <Cork> and while we're at it {} is objects
[02:39:37] <noobienoob> e.g $(document).ready(function() {    });     What content should be enclosed in () vs {}
[02:40:05] <noobienoob> Cork: Looked up after pressing enter and there was the answer already there. Thanks :)
[02:40:07] <Cork> noobienoob: do you know any other programming languages?
[02:40:18] <noobienoob> Cork: No.
[02:40:32] <Cork> { } in your example is a block
[02:40:46] <Cork> it is wrapping the code that belongs to the function
[02:41:02] <Cork> in your case function() {    } is an anonymous function
[02:41:07] <Cork> with no code in it
[02:41:22] <Cork> the function is passed as a argument to ready
[02:41:32] <Cork> function read(callback) {}
[02:41:35] <Cork> *ready
[02:41:55] <Cork> so $(document).ready(function() {    }); is basically the same as
[02:42:13] <Cork> function myCallback() {} $(document).ready(myCallback);
[02:42:51] <Cork> hope that makes it a little clearer
[02:43:37] <noobienoob> Cork: Thanks again :)
[02:44:02] <Cork> np
[02:48:08] <ravenzz> or just $(myCallback) :?)
[02:48:15] <Cork> ya
[02:48:32] <Cork> but he can learn that when he has gotten his head around how things work
[02:48:39] <Cork> no need to complicate it with shortcuts
[02:48:40] <ravenzz> right
[02:50:11] <shredding> Hey all.
[02:50:37] <beachandbytes> hello
[02:51:51] <shredding> I have to implement a-b testing with a fancy webservice. For that I need to make sure that a form submit event on the dedicated js is fired BEFORE the ones that are registered on the page.
[02:52:05] <shredding> I found that: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2360655/jquery-event-handlers-always-execute-in-order-they-were-bound-any-way-around-t
[02:52:12] <shredding> But it seems not to work with submit events ...
[02:52:45] <Cork> shredding: it does
[02:52:47] <shredding> Is there a way to say: I have this submit event and i want it at the beginning of the queue?
[02:52:52] <Cork> but remember those are only jquery events
[02:52:57] <shredding> ?
[02:53:00] <Cork> shredding: no
[02:53:20] <Cork> shredding: events is a feature native to dom, the browser provides the hooks
[02:53:35] <shredding> Cork: All registered events on the page are jquery.
[02:53:43] <Cork> shredding: jquery builds an array for events you add through bind/on/delegate/click and so on
[02:53:51] <shredding> Yep, i know.
[02:54:02] <Cork> the array is built on the element the event was bound on
[02:54:12] <Cork> so if you use delegate it will shift the order
[02:54:14] <shredding> Where is that array on the $ object?
[02:54:37] <Cork> $._data(elm, 'events')
[02:54:44] <Cork> but that array isn't officially supported
[02:54:50] <Cork> it's internal
[02:54:52] <Cork> and no an api
[02:55:06] <Cork> so your code might break in future updates if you depend on it
[02:56:29] <shredding> Hm, $._data($(‚#my-form‘), 'events'); returns undefined.
[02:56:43] <shredding> However, you said „delegate“ would be a more elegant solution?
[02:56:47] <Cork> that is not the code i showed you
[02:56:59] <Cork> $('#my-form') isn't a dom element
[02:57:09] <Cork> it is a dom element wrapped in a jquery object
[02:57:23] <Cork> $._data($('#my-form')[0], 'events')
[02:58:28] <shredding> Cork: Thanks, that works.
[02:58:43] <shredding> However, how would delegate be a more sufficient solution?
[02:58:57] <Cork> shredding: delegate works by event bubbling
[02:59:05] <shredding> To be honest, i didn’t get the docs.
[02:59:09] <Cork> the event fires on each element as it bubbles up
[02:59:29] <Cork> so if you bind the low prio events on a third level parent
[02:59:37] <Cork> and the prio on a second level parent
[02:59:44] <Cork> the prio will always fire first
[03:00:07] <Cork> or if you delegate the low prio to a parent and bind the prio directly to the element
[03:00:35] <shredding> You are talking about this func, right: https://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[03:00:39] <Cork> shredding: delegation works by checking where the event came from on a parent of the element your actually interested in
[03:00:49] <Cork> shredding: yes and no, you can do the same with .on
[03:00:54] <Cork> if you use the delegate syntax for it
[03:01:00] <shredding> That’s where i got confused.
[03:01:11] <Cork> but yes that function has the best description of how things work
[03:01:11] <shredding> Because i read that delegate is deprecated in favor of .on
[03:01:23] <Cork> it isn't
[03:01:28] <Cork> its superseeded
[03:01:39] <Cork> delegate isn't depricated
[03:02:10] <Cork> shredding: what they mean by that is that they want to push ppl to use on, but there is no plan to remove the function
[03:02:21] <shredding> Okay.
[03:02:29] <shredding> Thank you for that input, i will read into that!
[03:02:30] <Cork> and honestly i don't think they should be pushing on it that hard
[03:02:43] <Cork> shredding: but like i said you can do the same thing with on
[03:02:52] <ocx> for what are these data-* used ? data-theme="c" data-track-theme="c"
[03:02:52] <Cork> shredding: on is a combination of .bind and .delegate
[03:03:27] <Cork> ocx: data- are spec reserved attribute prefixes
[03:03:39] <ocx> Cork: for instance i am using jquery mobile what doe these do ?
[03:03:47] <Cork> it is there so that future specs won't conflict with user invented attributes
[03:03:59] <Cork> ocx: check the jqm docs
[03:04:06] <Cork> it is specific to what they want to do
[03:04:21] <xec> ocx: google gave me this http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.0.1/docs/forms/slider/
[03:04:32] <xec> ocx: check the bottom (theming)
[03:04:33] <Cork> data- just means it isn't controlled by the spec
[03:04:35] <dijitaltrix> Can someone tell me where I'm going wrong, I'm trying to set a field value with selectize.js, the POST to the server works and I get teh response but I can set it in selectize.js, it remains blank!
[03:04:37] <dijitaltrix> http://pastebin.com/ewZjKaST
[03:05:24] <ocx> Cork: which specs? you mean the default html specs?
[03:05:26] <Cork> dijitaltrix: you can't use return from ajax calls
[03:05:31] <Cork> ocx: yes
[03:05:44] <Cork> ?g whatwg data attribute
[03:05:45] <b-ot> Cork: 3.2 Elements — HTML Standard - WhatWG → http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/elements.html
[03:05:58] <dijitaltrix> cork ok thx.. I'll refactor it
[03:06:00] <ocx> jqm is good for mobile app look and feel or is there any better Cork
[03:06:06] <Cork> ocx: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/elements.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-*-attributes
[03:06:34] <Cork> dijenerate: also remember that ajax is async, so you need to pass the data from always
[03:06:47] <Cork> dijenerate: you can't expect data to exist in code that run sync
[03:07:07] <Cork> and that is why return won't work
[03:07:43] <Cork> ocx: i don't like the heavy js reliance in jqm, so i don't use it
[03:07:55] <Cork> ocx: i do it with pure html mostly
[03:07:58] <ocx> Cork: but it has a good look and feel
[03:08:09] <Cork> ocx: if you like it, use it
[03:08:37] <Cork> bug look and feel is just css
[03:08:41] <Cork> *but
[03:09:46] <dijitaltrix> cork, I follow you but the ajax call is inside a function declaration, surely the return should be allowed here?
[03:09:55] <Cork> no
[03:10:19] <Cork> dijitaltrix: what i mean is the always callback will happen AFTER the function you call $.post in has exited
[03:10:31] <dijitaltrix> oh right..
[03:10:35] <Cork> dijitaltrix: js actually guarantee it won't ever be called before that
[03:10:47] <dijitaltrix> cork yep I get you
[03:10:55] <ocx> Cork: so mainly when we setting these data-elements we are passing some parameters from html into the jqm to select stuff and return into html right?
[03:11:00] <Cork> cause the current stack has to unwind completely before the callback can fire
[03:11:26] <Cork> ocx: you are setting custom attributes on the dom element
[03:11:35] <Cork> ocx: and some of those names jqm look for
[03:11:44] <dijitaltrix> cork I'll try set async: false
[03:11:44] <ocx> got it
[03:11:54] <Cork> dijitaltrix: you shouldn't do that
[03:12:02] <ocx> jqpm will overwrite some stuff on the dom to give it that looknfeel then Cork ?
[03:12:05] <dijitaltrix> cork whats the implications?
[03:12:11] <Cork> dijitaltrix: sync ajax will frees the page and in some cases the entire browser
[03:12:21] <Cork> until the response from the server gets back
[03:12:27] <dijitaltrix> cork.. hmm. okay
[03:12:29] <Cork> so if you lose the connection to the server
[03:12:44] <Cork> the browser/page stays frozen until the connection times out
[03:12:51] <Cork> even gif images won't animate
[03:12:57] <Cork> so, no don't go there
[03:13:35] <Cork> ocx: yes jqm modifies the dom when the page/ajax loads
[03:13:47] <dijitaltrix> cork no I wont thx
[03:14:03] <Cork> ocx: it adds extra elements, adds classes and so on
[03:14:46] <ocx> ok
[03:14:48] <ocx> thanks
[03:16:42] <bobdobbs`> el.remove() removes an element from the dom. So howcome when I enter 'el' into the console, and hit return, I still see objects? where are they?
[03:17:06] <Cork> bobdobbs`: they are referenced by the el variable
[03:17:17] <bobdobbs`> hi Cork
[03:17:29] <Cork> bobdobbs`: remove() just removes jquery data from the element and removes the parentNode link
[03:17:44] <bobdobbs`> I see
[03:17:53] <Cork> bobdobbs`: the removal of the actual element happens when nothing is referencing the element
[03:18:02] <Cork> then gc will find it and release the memory
[03:18:13] <bobdobbs`> gc>
[03:18:20] <bobdobbs`> *gc?
[03:18:28] <Cork> Garbage Collector
[03:18:31] * bobdobbs` curses at keyboard
[03:18:36] <bobdobbs`> ah, I see
[03:18:45] <bobdobbs`> thanks
[03:18:54] <Cork> it is a process that periodically walk memory pointers in the browsers releasing memory that nothing uses
[03:41:53] <VectorX> i got jquery loaded at the bottom of the page, but some pages are loading js that uses jquery in the middle and im getting an "Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined " error how can i sort this out |?
[03:42:17] <Cork> VectorX: move the jquery lib to head
[03:43:17] <VectorX> ic
[03:49:30] <qdk> Cork: hehe, now there is a big can of surprise. :-)
[03:49:48] <Cork> qdk: sorry?
[03:50:03] <qdk> [11:42] Cork VectorX: move the jquery lib to head
[03:50:10] <Cork> ah
[03:55:56] <SprkDev> why does my modal window header dissappears after remove DOM loads. Why? I need to fix this coz I need the close button.
[03:56:02] <the8thbit> Hm, so I've run into a problem. I'm using .load() to load the same page markup several times, and then I'm using the load callback to call a function in js accessible to the HTML I'm loading. This function initializes my loaded content by adding info to divs with certain ids
[03:56:45] <the8thbit> the only issue is that, because I'm calling .load() multiple times, I have multiples of the same ids, so only the id from the first load gets altered
[04:01:56] <quicksilver> the8thbit: best solution is no to use ID in dynamically loaded stuff
[04:02:21] <quicksilver> otherwise you can modify the ID just after it gets loaded to something unique, perhaps
[04:03:06] <the8thbit> quicksilver: What are some alternatives to using ID here? I need to target a particular part of the HTML and modify its .html()
[04:03:19] <Cork> use classes
[04:03:35] <Cork> if you have multiple elements you need to identify classes are meant for that
[04:03:42] <the8thbit> Cork: If I uses classes, then every callback will target every instance I have loaded?
[04:04:00] <Cork> the8thbit: you should move the js out of the html
[04:04:08] <Cork> and have it just handle them all generically
[04:04:13] <the8thbit> I don't have any js in my html
[04:04:15] <Cork> use the dom relation to find the target
[04:04:51] <Cork> the8thbit: so you have <script> tags that pulls in the js for each .load as a second tcp connection?
[04:05:02] <Cork> *in the html for each
[04:05:25] <the8thbit> Cork: Yeah, I have a js file that gets loaded by the html file
[04:05:35] <Cork> the8thbit: so just make that code static
[04:05:43] <Cork> and use delegated event handlers
[04:05:56] <Cork> and from the $(this) object find the related elements to the target
[04:05:58] <Cork> and work from there
[04:06:12] <quicksilver> the8thbit: cork is giving you good advice, but just because you use classes doesn't mean you target every one
[04:06:16] <quicksilver> the selector language is powerful
[04:06:16] <the8thbit> Cork: Any resources on that? I don't know what delegated event handlers or DOM relation means
[04:06:35] <Cork> ?api delegate
[04:06:35] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:06:49] <quicksilver> you can target "all foo with class bar inside the third baz within the foom of class bark"
[04:06:52] <quicksilver> or whatever.
[04:07:13] <the8thbit> thanks cork
[04:07:24] <Cork> quicksilver: if he adds it dynamically on each .load he will get duplicate event handlers though
[04:07:31] <Cork> so he needs the delegate solution
[04:08:04] <the8thbit> Cork: Each load is put into a div with a unique id that is generated on the fly
[04:08:12] <the8thbit> so maybe I could select from within that unique id?
[04:09:17] <Cork> the8thbit: ya, though the code becomes harder to manage
[04:09:29] <Cork> the8thbit: as long as you don't use the same id anywhere more then once
[04:09:29] <quicksilver> Cork: agreed.
[04:09:34] <Cork> as that is invalid html
[04:09:43] <quicksilver> Cork: learning delegation is important.
[04:09:57] <the8thbit> delegation it is, then
[04:10:37] <the8thbit> Cork: So right now, every time I load I'm loading many ids, and if I load multiple times then I'm loading many ids multiple times. Is that invalid html?
[04:10:38] <CrowX-> can .js file be loaded from within a jquery call?
[04:10:56] <Cork> the8thbit: yes
[04:11:08] <Cork> the8thbit: an id my only exist once in the entire page
[04:11:21] <Cork> the8thbit: if it needs to exist more then once, use class
[04:11:34] <CrowX-> anyone?
[04:11:35] <Cork> CrowX-: kinda
[04:11:38] <CrowX-> Cork, how
[04:11:41] <Cork> CrowX-: you can use $.getScript
[04:11:52] <Cork> but it will basically fetch the js as text
[04:11:57] <Cork> and then eval() it
[04:12:07] <CrowX-> that's what I need
[04:12:20] <the8thbit> Cork: okie, thanks
[04:20:42] <Justus> hi, is it normal that $('#element').offset().top is totally inconsistent when you change browsers?
[04:21:05] <the8thbit> ugh, I still don't understand how delegation helps me here
[04:25:17] <Cork> the8thbit: you bind a static event handler to an element you don't modify
[04:25:32] <Cork> the8thbit: and then you give it selectors that matches the element that you later add
[04:25:56] <Cork> the8thbit: that way the event handlers will work for new elements, without you having to bind them for each element as you add them
[04:26:14] <Cork> the8thbit: and if you in the event handlers after that works from the element that fired the event
[04:26:31] <Cork> you can work without having to have unique selectors finding things
[04:27:33] <the8thbit> Cork: what is the syntax for binding a static event handler?
[04:28:11] <the8thbit> is that where .delegate/.on come in?
[04:28:20] <Cork> $('parent that is always there').on('click', 'selector that matches a child of the parent', function() {})
[04:28:23] <Cork> yes
[04:28:55] <the8thbit> what confuses me is that I don't want this to occur on click, I want it to occur when the page is loaded
[04:29:47] <decx> so you want something to happen when the ... document is .... ready
[04:30:10] <the8thbit> so .on( 'ready' ... ?
[04:36:08] <Cork> the8thbit: there is no page loading for ajax
[04:36:27] <Cork> the8thbit: if you use ready in the callback from load
[04:36:33] <Cork> you can just remove the ready section
[04:36:36] <Cork> it doesn't do anything
[04:38:23] <the8thbit> Cork: So do I attach the handler to the container that I'm loading into...?
[04:38:43] <Cork> the8thbit: yes that is a solution
[04:38:56] <Cork> do that once as the main page loads
[04:39:03] <Cork> and then you don't need to attach them again
[04:39:34] <the8thbit> ok cool
[04:40:55] <JqueryAfter> hi all
[04:40:58] <JqueryAfter> how to reload my javascript file every ajax request make my html page without reloading ?
[04:41:39] <the8thbit> Cork: So then I call .load in the callback from .on?
[04:41:54] <Cork> JqueryAfter: you shouldn't do that
[04:42:11] <Cork> the8thbit: if you want the load to happen from a user event, yes
[04:42:45] <the8thbit> Cork: I want it to occur immediately, not from a user event.
[04:43:53] <the8thbit> Cork: It might help if I posted my code?
[04:44:00] <Cork> the8thbit: might
[04:45:19] <JqueryAfter> In my html page, I have a page that appears by ajax, and on this page posted by ajax I have a link that displays another page by ajax. But when I click directly on it, then I go, but if I go to another page and I return to my first page and I click it shows me that the page does not exist
[04:45:27] <the8thbit> Cork: http://hastebin.com/hugawoduwi.coffee
[04:45:45] <the8thbit> That's my parent code
[04:49:59] <JqueryAfter> Cork: In my html page, I have a page that appears by ajax, and on this page posted by ajax I have a link that displays another page by ajax. But when I click directly on it, then I go, but if I go to another page and I return to my first page and I click it shows me that the page does not exist
[04:50:03] <the8thbit> Cork: This is the js used by the code I'm loading: http://hastebin.com/jeqopulowi.coffee
[04:50:35] <Cork> the8thbit: you arn't really using events at all there
[04:50:50] <Cork> the8thbit: just do what you are doing and use classes in the content you load
[04:50:53] <Cork> and you should be fine
[04:51:01] <the8thbit> oh, ok
[04:51:27] <the8thbit> it'll just figure out which instance of the class I want based on the context in which I call it?
[04:51:55] <Cork> the8thbit: $('delta-content' + i).find('.class_name')
[04:52:12] <ocx> i am getting icon not found in jqm www/images/icons-18-white.png
[04:52:15] <the8thbit> ah, cool
[04:52:24] <ocx> where can i download these? / i downloaded the jqm but no icons with that name there
[04:52:39] <the8thbit> Cork: Did you say that that will lead to unmanagable code, or were you talking about something else?
[04:54:25] <Cork> the8thbit: the code that is most likely the problem is prob going to be in convols.init( res[callback_iterator].topic );
[04:54:42] <Cork> the8thbit: as the code you pasted doesn't use ANY event handlers at all
[04:56:25] <JqueryAfter> Cork: please help me if you have a time for me
[04:56:56] <Cork> JqueryAfter: the problem is most likely not about loading the js
[04:57:08] <Cork> JqueryAfter: and i don't have enough info to say what it might be
[04:58:19] <JqueryAfter> ok Cork : http://hastebin.com/cuqusowube.coffee
[04:58:48] <Cork> ah
[04:59:19] <Cork> JqueryAfter: and when you "go back" you load new content into #contenu?
[04:59:49] <JqueryAfter> yes
[04:59:57] <Cork> JqueryAfter: $("a") will build a list of the elements that exist on the page
[05:00:08] <Cork> and then .click will loop that list and attache click event handlers
[05:00:14] <Cork> so when you load the new content
[05:00:20] <Cork> all the <a> tags gets removed
[05:00:25] <Cork> so no event listeners exist
[05:00:35] <Cork> JqueryAfter: the solution for that is to use delegated event listeners
[05:00:40] <Cork> that you attach to #contenu
[05:00:54] <Cork> $('#contenu').on('click', 'a', function() {})
[05:01:10] <Cork> JqueryAfter: also define your variables
[05:03:53] <the8thbit> Cork: Yay, it works!
[05:04:07] <Cork> the8thbit: nice
[05:04:12] <JqueryAfter> Cork: can you tell me the result with my code? because I'm not very good at javascript, excuse me
[05:04:33] <Cork> JqueryAfter: the code bind an event listener to #contenu
[05:04:39] <the8thbit> I'll try to understand handlers when I have some free time... maybe refactor a bit
[05:04:50] <Cork> the even handler checks for event that bubble up from child elements that match the selector 'a'
[05:05:17] <Cork> JqueryAfter: the result is that every time you click an <a> element inside the #contenu element
[05:05:21] <Cork> the event will fire
[05:05:36] <Cork> no matter if the element existed while you added the event listener or not
[05:07:23] <JqueryAfter> i removed a function empty() ?
[05:08:17] <Cork> no you shouldn't remove that
[05:08:28] <JqueryAfter> ok ok
[05:08:32] <Cork> you can replace .empty().append() with .html() if you like
[05:11:51] <fps> hi, in some cases our client code needs to make almost a thousand ajax calls, and it seems that while browsers seem to queue the connections they still don't take lightly to this kind of hammering
[05:12:27] <fps> so i wonder if there's a tried and tested, non-intrusive (small code changes) way to use another "connection pool"?
[05:12:47] <Hooloovoo> 8|
[05:13:02] <Hooloovoo> fps: sounds like you have to go back to the whiteboard
[05:13:10] <Cork> fps: only solutions would be to spread it cross multiple subdomains
[05:13:19] <Cork> though ya
[05:13:25] <fps> no, i want to spread them out in time..
[05:13:29] <JqueryAfter> ok  Cork , but i can not do for reload "a"
[05:13:52] <fps> i.e. use a maximum of n concurrent ones, and once one finishes, execute the next one
[05:14:00] <Cork> fps: you most likely want to collect those ajax calls and give one response instead
[05:14:08] <Cork> fps: if nothing else so for the http overhead
[05:14:27] <fps> that is non critical, since it's not a public service
[05:14:28] <Cork> fps: i most browsers max out at 9 connections to a server
[05:14:35] <decx> 1000 ajax calls :o
[05:14:35] <fps> the only problem is that the browser crawls to a halt
[05:14:37] <Cork> some older allowed less
[05:14:49] <JqueryAfter> i'm lost ahahah
[05:14:56] <systemfault> Cork: IE8 2…… Most other browsers 6… latest chrome 10  IIRC
[05:15:05] <decx> maybe look into sockets for a persistent connection
[05:15:10] <Cork> fps: what your doing is extremely inefficient
[05:15:14] <fps> Cork: yes
[05:15:19] <fps> i am aware of that
[05:15:48] <Cork> fps: only way you can get around it would be to batch it into groups and hold the rest until you get responses from the first batch
[05:16:07] <Cork> fps: but that will make the full queue take multiple times longer to perform
[05:16:20] <Hooloovoo> Even though half of all jquery plugins are made for people to remedy crappy code i've never heard anything about a plugin that queue ajax requests.
[05:16:26] <fps> Cork: yes, i am aware of how to do the queueing myself but i'd rather use well tested code that hack up a new solution
[05:16:39] <Cork> JqueryAfter: all you needed to do was replace the $('a').click( call in the top of your paste
[05:16:44] <Cork> JqueryAfter: and it should work
[05:17:11] <Cork> fps: didn't say you should hack it up your self
[05:17:18] <Cork> fps: deferred can help you solve it
[05:17:27] <fps> Cork: ok, taking a look
[05:17:40] <Cork> but on the other hand; your painting over crap
[05:17:44] <Cork> you should fix the problem instead
[05:17:45] <fps> :D
[05:18:00] <Cork> cause your solution won't scale above a few users
[05:18:01] <JqueryAfter> Cork:  yes but it's not work
[05:18:23] <Cork> JqueryAfter: can't help you much more then
[05:18:33] <Cork> the code you showed should work, so it might be something else
[05:18:54] <fps> like i said: this is not a public service and the amount of users is very limited.. i'll weight the work required to redesign the ajax calls to deliver whole collections vs. the queueing implementation and use the one that will produce less work
[05:18:56] <Cork> Hooloovoo: there is
[05:19:03] <Cork> ?api jquery ajax queue
[05:19:08] <Cork> opps
[05:19:11] <Cork> ?g jquery ajax queue

[05:20:00] <Cork> Hooloovoo: i used it back in the old jquery.autocomplete days
[05:20:03] <fps> taking a look. thanks
[05:20:11] <Cork> before it was added to jquery ui
[05:20:12] <Hooloovoo> Cork: I stand corrected. :P
[05:20:16] <Cork> fps: you don't need that
[05:20:29] <Cork> fps: and i'm not even sure it works anymore
[05:21:05] <Cork> fps: that plugin was written before deferred existed
[05:21:18] <Cork> now days you can do it with a few lines of code and plain jquery
[05:22:16] <JqueryAfter> ok i don't understand this problems
[05:25:53] <JqueryAfter> Cork: i replace $('a').click( function() { (((((by)))))) $('#contenu').on('click', 'a', function() { ???
[05:26:10] <JqueryAfter> but it's not work
[05:26:21] <Cork> yes from the code you showed that should work
[05:26:33] <Cork> JqueryAfter: can't help more without more details
[05:26:37] <systemfault> Perhaps he uses jQuery 1.3 :P
[05:26:47] <Cork> ugg
[05:26:55] <Cork> systemfault: well 1.8 would be enough
[05:27:08] <systemfault> JqueryAfter: What version of jQuery do you use?
[05:28:05] <seutje> much brackets
[05:28:24] <systemfault> so LISPy
[05:28:25] <systemfault> wow
[05:29:35] <JqueryAfter> systemfault: jquery 1.2.6
[05:29:43] <hxm> how to match a 6digit number with jquery? i tried .match('\d{6}') but says null
[05:29:44] <beancurd> parens for you, parens for you, parens for everyoonnene
[05:30:31] <beancurd> hxm try match(/\d{6}/)
[05:30:53] <hxm> oh, thanks
[05:32:20] <systemfault> JqueryAfter: I hope you’re joking, if you write in your JS console: jQuery.fn.jquery, it shows 1.2.6?
[05:32:57] <beancurd> systemfault: i can see your mind unravelling.
[05:33:08] <Cork> seutje: no parenthesis, there isn't actually any brackets in that line :)
[05:33:37] <JqueryAfter> systemfault:  it's my version jquery for my site why ? explain me, because I'm not expert
[05:33:38] <seutje> I'ma call em brackets anyway :P
[05:33:57] <seutje> it's internal policy to use confusing terminology on mondays
[05:33:59] <beancurd> JqueryAfter: can you link your site?
[05:34:13] <systemfault> JqueryAfter: If you’re not kidding me.. your version is like prehistoric.
[05:34:24] <JqueryAfter> yes beancurd in your mp
[05:34:28] <Cork> JqueryAfter: you might want to update to a jquery version that is a bit newer...
[05:34:31] <systemfault> There were probably dinosaurs walking around at the time where jQuery 1.2.6 was written.
[05:34:42] <beancurd> maybe JqueryAfter runs lingscars.com
[05:35:06] <beancurd> don't go there.
[05:35:09] <beancurd> unless you want eyeball hurt.
[05:35:11] <jason__> hello
[05:35:18] <beancurd> hello jason.
[05:35:25] <decx> i'm an adventurer/archeologist, this file belongs in a museum
[05:35:51] <beancurd> decx: you gotta smash artifacts indy jones style first.
[05:35:58] <Cork> systemfault: note prehistoric, just 5 years old :)
[05:36:16] <decx> that's like a billion internetyears
[05:36:16] <Cork> or 4 years 10 months 0 days :)
[05:36:52] <JqueryAfter> what do I do in this case? this is not going to change my code if I change my version of jquery?
[05:37:08] <seutje> 1.2.6 was probably what propelled jQuery to e-fame
[05:37:25] <beancurd> i think i was still wrangling with mootools back then.
[05:37:31] <beancurd> hehehe... mootools.
[05:37:46] <decx> back then it was an actual competition between jq, moo and prototype
[05:37:51] <Cork> JqueryAfter: you could try using $('a').live
[05:38:07] <Cork> JqueryAfter: but you really should set time of moving to a semi modern version of jquery
[05:38:25] <Cork> JqueryAfter: but if it is that old you are going to have problems, so do it when you have time
[05:38:49] <Cork> 1.5 at lest
[05:38:52] <Cork> 1.11 if possible
[05:39:34] <JqueryAfter> I'll do it now i take a 1.5 ? Cork
[05:40:03] <Cork> JqueryAfter: i would recommend trying 1.11
[05:40:40] <Cork> you are going to go through a lot of code and make sure it works, so jumping up to a supported version when your at it shouldn't make very much difference
[05:40:50] <JqueryAfter> ok thank, and my problem resolved?
[05:41:02] <Cork> JqueryAfter: yes .on works in 1.9+
[05:41:12] <Cork> and .delegate works in 1.5+
[05:41:21] <Cork> if you can't get 1.11 working
[05:42:26] <JqueryAfter> ok, I'll take the 1.5? it's best ?
[05:42:40] <Cork> JqueryAfter: like i said, try 1.11 first
[05:42:45] <Cork> if too much break try 1.5
[05:42:54] <Cork> JqueryAfter: 1.5 is quite old too
[05:43:04] <Cork> so it would be good if you jumped up to 1.9+
[05:43:23] <Cork> as then you would have gone through the incompatible changes there is
[05:43:29] <JqueryAfter> ok it's good
[05:43:29] <Cork> and shouldn't be too many of those for a while
[05:43:56] <Cork> JqueryAfter: are you working in a cms btw?
[05:44:20] <Cork> you might have core features of the cms depending on jquery 1.2.6
[05:44:23] <seutje> Drupal 6?
[05:44:28] * Cork nods
[05:44:36] <seutje> `g drupal jquery_update
[05:44:36] <b-ot> seutje: jQuery Update | Drupal.org → https://drupal.org/project/jquery_update
[05:44:43] <Cork> why, did i smell drupal :)
[05:44:53] <Cork> ya use that drupal plugin
[05:44:58] <beancurd> php eeeewwwww
[05:45:05] <beancurd> *says the .net guy :(
[05:45:11] <seutje> :')
[05:45:20] <beancurd> pot kettle black.
[05:45:29] <JqueryAfter> no, i don't like cms, i like code with my hands
[05:45:39] <seutje> just wait  for the haskell elitists to come look down from their high horses
[05:45:42] <Cork> beancurd: not like rails is much better
[05:45:43] <beancurd> i code with forehead.
[05:46:00] <seutje> headache-driven development
[05:46:25] <beancurd> Cork: tell me that when you have to pay for every single decently maintained package.
[05:46:39] <Cork> beancurd: heh, true
[05:46:55] <Cork> that is a thing when you use ms tools and environments
[05:46:59] <beancurd> oh.... and SOAP APIs.
[05:47:03] <beancurd> ahahahaha .ahahahaha ....
[05:47:05] <beancurd> woe is me.
[05:47:15] <Cork> beancurd: oh, you mean the thing rails dropped from there api
[05:47:16] <beancurd> WHO LUVS ME SOME XML
[05:47:27] <Cork> from something they SUPPORTED IN CORE before...
[05:47:49] <JqueryAfter> Cork:  it's good i have 1.11
[05:47:56] <Cork> beancurd: i had to rewrite an entire payment hookin api cause of that
[05:48:04] <seutje> fun times
[05:48:08] <beancurd> hahaha.
[05:48:08] <Cork> no...
[05:48:17] <seutje> job security :D
[05:48:37] <beancurd> Cork: the good thing about when things like that happen, is enough people get disgruntled, and someone will write a package to add it back in.
[05:48:44] <beancurd> and they'll put it on github.
[05:48:46] <seutje> half the corporate world thinks we do this on purpose
[05:49:08] <Cork> beancurd: sure, with completely different syntax, and different schema stores
[05:49:28] <seutje> so the outcome is the same
[05:49:35] <seutje> you have to go over it and rewrite bits of it
[05:49:37] <Cork> beancurd: we picked the core solution instead of third party cause we didn't want to have to rewrite it cause it wasn't supported
[05:49:40] <Cork> toche...
[05:49:56] <beancurd> if it was .net, some asshole company would do that, then charge you $ for it, then no one uses it, so they jack up the price. then even less people use it, so there's next to 0 community support for it.
[05:49:59] <seutje> well that worked out dandy :D
[05:50:17] <JqueryAfter> Now the code works, but the menu that calls the same page does not work Cork
[05:50:50] <Cork> JqueryAfter: don't think i can help much more without seeing what happens
[05:51:11] <beancurd> JqueryAfter: check your console and see what errors you're getting.
[05:51:28] <beancurd> most of the time you can self diagnose the issue just by googling the errors.
[05:51:41] <beancurd> 'does not work' is kinda vague dude.
[05:53:11] <JqueryAfter> ok beancurd, thank Cork  very thank :) my site web is on my pc (localhost) i'm in public place, tonight I put online
[05:53:25] <beancurd> all good bro.
[05:57:24] <bberry> if i have a .done and a .always, do both of them fire? And if yes, does the .done fire and then the .always?
[05:57:49] <bberry> (assuming a valid response from the server)
[06:00:04] <JqueryHelp> beancurd:
[06:00:37] <beancurd> JqueryHelp: sup.
[06:01:00] <systemfault> bberry: Callbacks are executed in the order they’re attached.
[06:01:38] <bberry> systemfault: cool, thanks, and good to know!
[06:01:46] <janq> Does anyone know a way to triger a chosen element via an onClick event somewhere else on the dom?
[06:01:55] <janq> http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
[06:02:08] <Cork> janne: $('target').click()
[06:02:26] <Cork> janne: or $('target').trigger('click') if you want a more verbose version
[06:02:28] <systemfault> Using plain callbacks for async stuff is insane when you have promises :P
[06:02:48] <Cork> systemfault: well except if you need to keep down the overhead
[06:03:02] <systemfault> Even then… newer promise libs are really fast.
[06:03:09] <systemfault> They’re not all like Q
[06:03:12] <Cork> systemfault: didn't talk about speed
[06:03:19] <JqueryHelp> I do not understand why it takes me "a" of my content and not the # # is my "ul" beancurd
[06:03:27] <systemfault> Cork: What other overhead exists in a browser?
[06:03:31] <Cork> but it creates a lot of variables and objects
[06:03:36] <Cork> systemfault: gc
[06:03:40] <systemfault> Meh.
[06:03:48] <Cork> systemfault: it can be a real factor actually
[06:04:15] <beancurd> JqueryHelp: i don't actually know what you're trying to do :/ you have an ul with an #id?
[06:04:33] <systemfault> Right… I’ve overused promises in the past on node in a way that it is difficult to imagine… Never had any problem.
[06:04:43] <Cork> systemfault: depending on the situation, you can end in a situation where you generate more memory gc then the gc can remove
[06:04:50] <Cork> so you get memory balloon
[06:05:15] <Cork> systemfault: ya, ajax is network based so it hard to get problematic there
[06:05:28] <Cork> systemfault: it is mainly when you need to make smooth animations
[06:05:36] <Cork> and things like that
[06:05:59] <systemfault> I don’t know if I would use promises for animations… I know jQuery supports it
[06:06:32] <Cork> systemfault: the comment wasn't specifically directed at promises, like it was badly implemented or something
[06:06:58] <Cork> systemfault: all i meant was that in some situations even creating one extra object might be enough to cause problems
[06:07:30] <Cork> though in those cases you can't really use jquery at all, as it is very object happy
[06:07:49] <systemfault> I’ve yet to see a case like that :/ That’s the thing.
[06:08:04] <janq> Ye gave it a try
[06:08:15] <Cork> systemfault: i have
[06:08:18] <janq> and that is not firing the right events
[06:08:31] <Cork> systemfault: but i can say, you basically never see it for normal page content
[06:08:43] <janq> (Testing from the console)
[06:08:51] <systemfault> Okay :)
[06:09:11] <Cork> systemfault: for normal page content you should focus at making the code easy to read and maintain
[06:09:26] <Cork> as it is normally speedy enough if you do that
[06:09:41] <Cork> as long as you avoid a few pitfalls
[06:10:12] <JqueryHelp> beancurd: I target my "a" but they do not work all
[06:10:44] <Cork> JqueryHelp: if you add a console.log in the handler does it trigger at all?
[06:10:55] <Cork> even on first load?
[06:11:04] <JqueryHelp> beancurd: http://hastebin.com/sexadehumi.coffee
[06:11:08] <JqueryHelp> ok Cork
[06:11:09] <beancurd> oh right, do other jquery things work?
[06:11:44] <JqueryHelp> Horodatage : 24/03/2014 13:56:08 Erreur : TypeError: document.getElementById(...) is null Fichier Source : chrome://web-developer/content/overlay/javascript/overlay.js Ligne : 7333
[06:12:23] <Cork> ugg french?
[06:12:25] <beancurd> can you paste your html too?
[06:12:37] <beancurd> fromage.
[06:13:17] <Cork> i don't think that is related to the problem at hand
[06:13:21] <JqueryHelp> it's work Cork  and beancurd my erreur is : $('#contenu').on('click', 'a', function() { replace by $('*').on('click', 'a', function() {
[06:13:41] <beancurd> that seems.. really weird.
[06:13:51] <decx> yeah you don't want that
[06:14:07] <beancurd> seems very heavy handed.
[06:14:07] <Cork> JqueryHelp: wait you get $('*').on('click', 'a', function() {?!?
[06:14:08] <JqueryHelp>  because the targeted content that "a" of # content
[06:14:16] <decx> maybe look at the first one and check if it isnt contentmenu instead of ocntentenu
[06:14:21] <Cork> when you run $('#contenu').on('click', 'a', function() {?
[06:14:53] <beancurd> probably just run $('#contenu') in the console, and see if that returns anything.
[06:15:08] <Cork> $('#contenu').length > 0
[06:15:09] <JqueryHelp> I get all my "a" support request page it's work now
[06:15:11] <beancurd> then try $('#contenu a') etc.
[06:15:12] <Cork> easier to check :)
[06:15:21] <beancurd> Cork: or that :)
[06:15:33] <Cork> beancurd: it's safer to use .length
[06:15:41] <Cork> it gives useful responses in all browsers
[06:15:42] <Cork> even ie
[06:15:49] <beancurd> what's ie. :p.
[06:15:51] <Cork> and not just [object object]
[06:16:01] <beancurd> i didn't know that... good to know.
[06:16:07] <JqueryHelp> firefox return => 0 errors
[06:16:28] <Cork> JqueryHelp: 0 errors?
[06:16:29] <beancurd> usually i just throw the selector there and see what it returns, and ie can eat poop.
[06:16:32] <Cork> what are you talking about now?
[06:17:04] <CrowX-> is $("#someID").remove() syntax changed in newer versions of jquery?
[06:17:10] <JqueryHelp> yes Cork : 0 errors in consol javascript
[06:17:12] <Cork> beancurd: it's getting more and more common that you get useful response, but even chrome and firefox native console has had problem in the past
[06:17:19] <krambiorix> hi, i want to get all visible empty input fields in a dialog : $(".ui-dialog").find("input:empty:visible")   -> how can i combine empty + visible?
[06:17:28] <CrowX-> I just upgraded to 1.8 and it doesn't remove elements
[06:17:30] <janq> any other ideas about the dom thing?
[06:17:30] <Cork> JqueryHelp: and $('#contenu').length ?
[06:17:57] <CrowX-> anyone?
[06:17:58] <Cork> krambiorix: i'm quite sure you can't use :empty for input fields
[06:18:08] <Cork> CrowX-: you need to cool down
[06:18:16] <Cork> don't expect answers the same second you ask
[06:18:18] <CrowX-> sorry
[06:18:20] <beancurd> haha.
[06:18:21] <JqueryHelp> http://hastebin.com/rofonadiha.coffee => code work Cork and beancurd
[06:18:39] <Cork> JqueryHelp: why did you change to * ?
[06:19:12] <Cork> krambiorix: sorry *sure you can use :empty*
[06:19:32] <JqueryHelp> but i have "a" out of #content, if i put #content only, then "a" out #content don't work
[06:19:53] <Cork> krambiorix: ya, :empty checks if innerHTML === ''
[06:20:00] <beancurd> did you try $("#content a")  ?
[06:20:09] <Cork> krambiorix: you need to check if the state of the element has any content
[06:20:17] <Cork> krambiorix: and you can't do that with css selectors
[06:20:33] <krambiorix> Cork, any alternative?
[06:20:35] <Cork> beancurd: he needs delegated
[06:20:47] <JqueryHelp> Cork:  because if I put # content, then load only the "a" that are in # content and ignores other
[06:20:49] <Cork> JqueryHelp: use  $(document).on('click', 'a') then
[06:20:55] <beancurd> oh, i came in halfway, fair enough.
[06:21:04] <JqueryHelp> ok Cork  i test your method
[06:21:52] <Cork> krambiorix: you could try something like $('input:visible').filter(function() { return this.value !== '' })
[06:21:52] <JqueryHelp> Cork:  your method work with $(document)
[06:22:14] <JqueryHelp> Cork:  thank very thank i like your method
[06:22:26] <Cork> CrowX-: no .remove() has been like that since 1.0
[06:22:33] <Cork> JqueryHelp: yw
[06:22:38] <JqueryHelp> and consol javascript return => 0 error Cork
[06:22:54] <Cork> not sure what that means
[06:22:56] <CrowX-> thanks
[06:23:13] <JqueryHelp> Cork:  you are boss of jquery i like your method !!!!!
[06:23:32] <beancurd> Cork: you should put that on your business card.
[06:23:33] <Cork> CrowX-: btw for refernce, if a function has changed how it works, it is normally listed in api.jquery.com
[06:23:35] <beancurd> boss of jquery.
[06:23:45] <Cork> heh
[06:23:45] <CrowX-> k
[06:24:04] <JqueryHelp> very good work Cork thank you for all help for me
[06:24:29] <Cork> CrowX-: an example http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[06:24:34] <FilipNortic> can I change behavioir of the tab command for  a form?
[06:24:57] <FilipNortic> what I'm doing works for enter but not tab
[06:25:00] <Cork> FilipNortic: i think you can grab the keydown and event.preventDefault()
[06:25:04] <JqueryHelp> and beancurd you too, you helped me a lot thank your very much for you two
[06:25:27] <beancurd> all good, i think cork helped more though.
[06:25:35] <Cork> FilipNortic: though you should be careful with that
[06:25:42] <seutje> let's not fight over who helped the most
[06:25:51] <Cork> FilipNortic: as disabling tab to jump between form fields will break accessibility
[06:25:52] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks!
[06:26:00] <beancurd> seutje: everybody knows it was you. duh.
[06:26:02] <Cork> seutje: who is fighting?
[06:26:22] <beancurd> i am... with wordpress.
[06:26:41] <Cork> FilipNortic: accessibility programs sends tabs to handle form fields
[06:26:50] <BinaryKitten> beancurd what issue?
[06:26:52] <Cork> FilipNortic: and you will make the life a mess for none seeing users
[06:27:16] <beancurd> BinaryKitten: gravity forms - notification email templates, i have no idea where these are stored.
[06:27:19] <JqueryHelp> yes beancurd ;)
[06:27:26] <BinaryKitten> beancurd oh lol
[06:27:34] <BinaryKitten> beancurd have you asked in #wordpress
[06:27:44] <FilipNortic> Cork: yes I know, but as it is now it suddently tabs to the url field not to the send button
[06:27:57] <Cork> FilipNortic: ah
[06:28:01] <JqueryHelp> i return on this chanel again later
[06:28:02] <beancurd> BinaryKitten: nope, i figured it's just buried in some menu item somewhere, andit's a 3rd party plugin.
[06:28:02] <Cork> FilipNortic: fix that in html instead
[06:28:15] <Cork> FilipNortic: tabindex="1" tabindex="2" tabindex="3"
[06:28:18] <BinaryKitten> beancurd yeah i know gravity forms well
[06:28:41] <beancurd> i don't :(
[06:40:41] <SprkDev> I need help. :-(
[06:40:58] <SprkDev> my jquery modal windows loses the header when it loads into it.
[06:42:57] <Cork> SprkDev: are you sure your loading in the correct element?
[06:43:11] <ocx> Cork: any idea why my settings is being centered in the middle of my footer? i need it to be aligned nextto the icon on the right
[06:43:12] <Cork> you might replace parts of the markup
[06:43:12] <ocx> http://pastebin.com/usAWLndi
[06:43:25] <ocx> my icon is being display on left too
[06:43:33] <SprkDev> Here it is http://pastebin.com/j2Ls7wAU
[06:43:48] <Cork> ocx: i would have to see the dom and what css affects it to answer that
[06:44:12] <SprkDev> http://pastebin.com/CU4FjNz2
[06:44:42] <Cork> SprkDev: what element would hold the title?
[06:46:15] <SprkDev> actually this is what I used before. But I would see this modal for 1 second. When the remove DOM loaded the header dissappeared. http://pastebin.com/2rR0Ryp7
[06:46:34] <SprkDev> *correctino when the remote dom loaded
[06:47:23] <SprkDev> the problem is why does modal-header dissapered after the remote URL loads?
[06:47:53] <SprkDev> is it because of data-target?
[06:48:36] <SprkDev> am I suppose to load it into modal-body and not modal-dialog? BUt I've tried this and it doesn't work.
[06:50:53] <SprkDev> well?
[06:55:45] <SprkDev> H E L L O !
[06:59:20] <ocx> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/x6BeB/
[07:01:01] <Cork> ocx: is this what you meant http://jsfiddle.net/x6BeB/1/ ?
[07:01:13] <Cork> it's right centered though
[07:01:20] <Cork> *aligned
[07:01:31] <ocx> yes
[07:01:41] <ocx> how did you do that
[07:02:03] <Cork> ocx: selected jquery 1.9 on the left side
[07:02:09] <Cork> and checked jquery-mobile
[07:02:35] <Cork> then i removed some html from the html window that shouldn't be there
[07:02:39] <Cork> (everything before iframe)
[07:02:41] <ocx> Cork: <link href="css/jquery.mobile-1.1.1.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/> <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.mobile-1.1.1.js"></script>
[07:03:09] <Cork> ocx: my point is it doesn't look like the default jquery style is causing the center you see
[07:03:25] <ocx> What is it then ?
[07:03:35] <Cork> your loading any custom css?
[07:05:25] <ocx> Cork: thts my html mainly http://pastebin.com/QKULdfmP
[07:05:32] <ocx> want me to share the style.css?
[07:05:42] <CrowX-> I have an image that follows the mouse cursor. How can I make it to follow the touch on touch screens too?
[07:06:27] <Cork> ocx: if you could present a live page with the rendering problems (ex. through jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net)
[07:06:31] <Cork> it would make things a lot simpler
[07:07:00] <Cork> CrowX-: you can move it on touchmove
[07:07:03] <Cork> ?g mdn touchmove
[07:07:04] <b-ot> Cork: touchmove - Web technology reference | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/touchmove
[07:09:13] <CrowX-> Cork, should I have included something like jquery.mobile for touchmove to work?
[07:09:45] <Cork> CrowX-: touchmove is browser native
[07:10:00] <Cork> .on('touchmove', function() {})
[07:10:32] <CrowX-> Cork, how do I access the touch coordinates?
[07:11:03] <ocx> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/vXRBY/3/
[07:11:23] <Cork> CrowX-: it's in the link i just gave you .)
[07:12:52] <Cork> CrowX-: event.changedTouches[0].clientX / Y
[07:13:48] <Cork> ocx: didn't you say yoou got the text centered?
[07:14:07] <ocx> yes i want to resolve that
[07:14:09] <CrowX-> Cork, should I add 'event' as an argument in the function, like .on('touchmove', function(event) {})
[07:14:20] <Cork> CrowX-: yes
[07:14:29] <Cork> ocx: can't reproduce it in the fiddle
[07:14:55] <Cork> ocx: looks like a live link might be needed
[07:15:09] <ocx> Cork: js/jquery.mobile-1.1.1.js
[07:15:13] <ocx> is this version too old?
[07:15:36] <Cork> ocx: try reproduce the problem in jsbin.com
[07:15:50] <Cork> it lets you specify things the way you want
[07:15:58] <Cork> as you have the full html to edit
[07:16:44] <Cork> ocx: but like i said, it starts to look like a link to your page is needed; unless you manage to reproduce the placement in the jsfiddle/jsbin page
[07:20:11] <ocx> Cork: doesnt seem to work on jsbin http://jsbin.com/gukunoso/3/
[07:32:41] <ocx> Cork: i need your help man
[07:33:13] <ocx> this setting thing is expanding on all the footer
[07:33:29] <Cork> i don't have time right now
[07:34:43] <jason__> hello
[07:38:24] <Hooloovoo> hello
[07:39:35] <ab2qik> Hello, some help on Ajax request/response please. http://jsfiddle.net/NE9Ny/
[07:39:54] <DansVC> hello :D
[07:40:12] <DansVC> hi rosalindwills
[07:41:35] <darkbasic> hi guys, I have problems with netbeans 8 and jquery: code completion works if the closing </script> is in the same line of the starting <script> tag, otherwise it doesn't work
[07:42:20] <ab2qik> Ajax anyone?  http://jsfiddle.net/NE9Ny/
[07:42:43] <Hooloovoo> ab2qik: What's your question?
[07:43:47] <ab2qik> Unable to display json values onto page? However, json is seen as returned in chrome  net tab
[07:45:55] <ab2qik> Hooloovoo: Contents of tour.json are copied in js panel of fiddle.
[07:46:28] <Cork> ab2qik: is the server sending the correct content-type?
[07:47:44] <ab2qik> data property is sending standard form data as part of request.
[07:49:35] <ab2qik> Get this error: Error: parsererror with message: SyntaxError: Unexpected token d
[07:52:04] <Cork> ab2qik: run jsonlint on the response data
[07:52:07] <Cork> ?g jsonlint
[07:52:07] <b-ot> Cork: JSONLint - The JSON Validator. → http://jsonlint.com/
[07:52:39] <ab2qik> ok, trying it out.
[07:56:54] <CrowX-> Cork, could you please look at this page's source(it's short), and tell me why touchmove doesn't work on smartphones, but works fine on chrome's emulator?
[07:57:45] <Cork> CrowX-: your using jqm?
[07:57:51] <CrowX-> Cork, no
[07:57:55] <Cork> ok sure
[07:58:07] <CrowX-> thanks
[08:01:13] <Cork> CrowX-: ?
[08:01:14] <ab2qik> Cork: Thanks. turned out Invalid. Correcting it and will re run.
[08:01:28] <CrowX-> Cork, what do you mean?
[08:01:40] <Cork> CrowX-: i need the link if i'm to look at it :)
[08:01:50] <CrowX-> Cork, ooh, sorry I forgot to add the url :). http://whatishacking.org/banner
[08:01:52] <Cork> ab2qik: the error is quite classic for invalid json
[08:01:55] <CrowX-> and here I was waiting :P
[08:02:34] <DansVC> :D
[08:02:35] <Cork> CrowX-: invalid doctype
[08:02:46] <Cork> <!doctype html> not <!DOCTYPE = html>
[08:03:10] <CrowX-> k
[08:03:11] <Cork> that might actually be the cause, as it would push the browser into quirks mode
[08:03:16] <DansVC> <Cork> hi, are you profetionnal?
[08:03:36] <Cork> DansVC: define professional
[08:04:05] <DansVC> profetional like are you web designer?
[08:04:12] <Cork> DansVC: yes
[08:04:17] <DansVC> :D
[08:04:31] <CrowX-> Cork, was the doctype it?
[08:04:34] <Cork> well i'm not a designer actually
[08:04:35] <DansVC> can you have a look to my web site and give your opinion?
[08:04:47] <Cork> i'm a developer that code backends to frontends
[08:04:50] <Cork> i don't do design
[08:04:54] <Cork> a designer does that
[08:05:12] <DansVC> :S
[08:05:16] <DansVC> ok, thx
[08:05:50] <Cork> CrowX-: i don't have a device to test on right now
[08:05:56] <Cork> CrowX-: but the doctype isn't changed yet
[08:06:32] <Cork> CrowX-: also have scripts in head or at the END of body
[08:06:35] <Cork> not the top of body
[08:08:09] <Acrack> hello
[08:08:27] <SprkDev> AHH!!!! THIS IS DRIVING ME INSANE!
[08:08:46] <Acrack> im trying to use ckeditor on a modal but its like ckeditor isn't initializing...
[08:08:53] <SprkDev> I have followed all the instructions to the letter, yet it does not work.
[08:09:15] <SprkDev> when the bootstrap modal pops up, if removes the header. Why?!!!!
[08:09:18] <Cork> SprkDev: try make a minimalistic testcase of the problem
[08:09:29] <Cork> SprkDev: it usually help finding the problem you have
[08:09:47] <Acrack> ho Cork o/
[08:09:49] <Cork> SprkDev: it isn't just so you can show it that i usually ask for it :)
[08:10:15] <Cork> SprkDev: it is that i actually hope that while you work on the testcase you will learn to find the problem your self
[08:10:25] <Cork> SprkDev: and learn to break down problems
[08:10:32] <Cork> Acrack: o/
[08:10:53] <Cork> Acrack: i think ckeditor uses an iframe
[08:11:12] <Cork> but man, was way to long since i added ckeditor to a page
[08:11:15] <Acrack> well in standard page i have it i see it, but when i trigger modal (i load ajax content)
[08:11:35] <Acrack> so i guess i have to load additional js like other plugins to make that ckeditor works
[08:11:40] <Acrack> yea no problem ^^
[08:11:40] <Cork> Acrack: check there api, they might have a function to initialize it on new elements
[08:11:49] <Acrack> gonna check
[08:11:53] <ab2qik> Cork: Thankyou, spot on!
[08:11:55] <Cork> or try something like #ckeditor
[08:12:01] <Cork> ab2qik: nice
[08:13:48] <CrowX-> Cork, could you perhaps guess what could cause this? When people try to drag the image with a touchmove function, the image appears at the place they touch first, and then doesn't move anymore.
[08:14:21] <Cork> CrowX-: might be the image covers so the event does't bubble?
[08:14:25] <Cork> just guessing
[08:14:35] <Cork> try add the event listener to document
[08:14:39] <Cork> *adding
[08:15:10] <CrowX-> Cork, what do you mean 'the image covers'?
[08:15:28] <Cork> CrowX-: the element you drag with toucmove
[08:15:34] <Cork> *touchmove
[08:20:01] <DansVC> hi someone know how to late a function?
[08:20:12] <Cork> late a function?
[08:20:19] <DansVC> like a delay
[08:20:28] <Cork> DansVC: setTimeout
[08:20:31] <DansVC> but is a for any function
[08:20:40] <Cork> DansVC: note timeout will make the function call async
[08:20:50] <DansVC> yes, but the problem is that i dont know what funcion
[08:21:01] <Cork> what??
[08:21:12] <DansVC> like a alert, everything stop
[08:21:13] <Cork> DansVC: setTimeout is the only option you have
[08:21:38] <DansVC> but after the alert everything coninue
[08:21:43] <Cork> DansVC: alert/confirm is very specific
[08:21:55] <Cork> there is special exception code to make those work like that
[08:21:59] <Cork> no js can do the same thing
[08:22:28] <DansVC> :S
[08:22:30] <Cork> DansVC: js is single threaded, so if you frees the code, the page freeses
[08:22:45] <Cork> so if you display a dialog and freeses the code the user can't click the buttons
[08:23:20] <DansVC> yes :S
[08:23:44] <Cork> DansVC: alert/confirm is legacy exception that browsers has to implement with event retriggering and a lot of other ugly hacks
[08:24:08] <Cork> DansVC: it's from the same era as document.write
[08:24:15] <Cork> it's called the DOM0 era
[08:25:15] <nameone> Can someone help me out please, im trying to make a jquery script that replaces curly single quotes
[08:25:19] <nameone> with '
[08:25:24] <nameone> but i cant seem to get anything working
[08:25:41] <Cork> nameone: jquery won't help you much with that kind of things
[08:26:01] <DansVC> nameone
[08:26:04] <nameone> i've seen a PHP script, but isn't that overkill?
[08:26:09] <DansVC> you can use css
[08:26:12] <DansVC> to do that
[08:26:21] <Cork> DansVC: no you can't
[08:26:32] <decx> find and replace?
[08:26:33] <Cork> css can't change unicode characters
[08:26:44] <DansVC> no read bad
[08:26:44] <nameone> i want the user to be able to paste text into a box, and then hit submit or something and all the single curly quotations to change
[08:26:47] <DansVC> :s
[08:26:57] <Cork> nameone: you most likely want to loop the textnodes in the page
[08:27:04] <Cork> and update the characters there
[08:27:24] <DansVC> nameone you want this: "hi" > 'hi' ??
[08:27:25] <Cork> nameone: sadly that means you need to go below elements into nodes
[08:27:37] <Cork> and jquery can't help you there
[08:27:52] <nameone> hmm
[08:27:57] <nameone> maybe php will be my best bet for this
[08:28:05] <Cork> DansVC: hi => 'hi'
[08:28:15] <Cork> nameone: yes it will
[08:28:29] <nameone> thanks guys!
[08:28:43] <Cork> nameone: if you can do this before you send it to the user it will be much easier
[08:28:54] <Cork> as server code is actually meant to handle things like this
[08:29:18] <nameone> well its mainly for myself and a couple of other people
[08:29:24] <nameone> just to parse and replace some text
[08:29:33] <SprkDev> I can only open jquery modal window once. Then it requires refresh to work. WHy? How do I fix?
[08:29:38] <DansVC> nameone you put that inside a tag?
[08:29:48] <farn5w0rth> does anyone have any plugin suggestions/methodologies for getting a dataTables table to export server-side CSV, Excel, PDF files?
[08:29:57] <Cork> i expect he meant cross the entire page
[08:30:15] <Cork> farn5w0rth: shouldn't be too hard
[08:30:42] <Cork> it's just about generating the string put it in a blob and puting it on a link for download
[08:30:48] <DansVC> if is the entire page have to make a loop and detect br and spaces
[08:31:03] <farn5w0rth> Cork: i've not been able to find a solution...http://datatables.net/forums/discussion/5129/x do you know of any examples that do it?
[08:31:08] <CrowX-> Cork, if you still remember my problem, I got this: it works on smartphones too if the person is making multiple individual touches on the screen, but not when they touch and drag.
[08:31:21] <Cork> DansVC: no, you can do it with textnodes
[08:31:45] <Cork> hmm
[08:31:52] <Cork> ?mdn touchdrag
[08:31:52] <b-ot> Cork: Event reference - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events
[08:31:56] <DansVC> I'm not very good with english
[08:32:14] <DansVC> so he have a textnodes and he will replace that
[08:32:19] <DansVC> in a new div?
[08:32:19] <Cork> CrowX-: not sure
[08:32:32] <DansVC> is on the textnode?
[08:32:37] <Cork> DansVC: your thinking elements not nodes
[08:32:49] <Cork> DansVC: dom nodes is what is below dom elements
[08:33:11] <Cork> DansVC: and every string that sits between/inside an element
[08:33:14] <Cork> is a textnode
[08:33:42] <Cork> so for <div>hi</div> you have a div element with innerHTML hi
[08:33:45] <DansVC> are you talking about innerHTML=
[08:33:47] <DansVC> ?
[08:34:05] <Cork> but below that you have a node type DIV with an additional node type text
[08:34:15] <Cork> and that is how the data is actually stored
[08:34:30] <DansVC> make this
[08:35:29] <Cork> DansVC: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Text
[08:35:34] <Cork> anyway gtg
[08:38:05] <SprkDev> Bootstrap modal window wont open second time.
[08:38:23] <DansVC> for(var i=0;i<$("#text").html().length;i++){if($("#text").html()[i] == " " || i===0){$("#result").html($("#result").html()+"'"$("#text").html()[i]}else{$("#result").html($("#result").html()[i])}
[08:38:51] <DansVC> Cork: like that?
[08:40:40] <DansVC> nameone
[08:42:29] <SprkDev> why won't jquery modal open second time?
[08:42:45] <DansVC> Cork are you there?
[08:43:43] <jugglinmike> Anyone out there familiar with jQuery Movile? The docs for the Slider widget are rendered with a "number" input, but I can't reproduce that http://api.jquerymobile.com/slider/
[08:43:57] <jugglinmike> For me, the original "range" input is displayed
[08:44:10] <Acrack> Cork: i just had to re-init it again...
[08:53:30] <SprkDev> why doesn't bootstrap modal work after the modal is clicked for second time
[08:54:36] <beancurd> goblins
[08:57:55] <ocx> when an href is clicked is the whole DOM RELOADED?
[08:58:15] <NoiseEee> ocx: if its loading a new page/reloading, yes
[08:59:13] <duch_kazatel> good morning #jquery
[08:59:19] <ocx> NoiseEee: if i access an page.html directly and toggle some buttons and exit , once the page is reaccessed the configuration of the buttons is retained,  now if i access page2.hmlt and put an href to page.html , the configuration is not saved
[08:59:37] <DansVC> Cork
[08:59:43] <DansVC> are you there?
[08:59:53] <duch_kazatel> ocx that has to do with how caching works - don't rely on the pages to consistently "save" state like that.
[09:00:10] <NoiseEee> ocx: i don't know what 'exit' means in that context. obviously page2 and page are different documents / a new DOM
[09:00:16] <ocx> the thing is loading on a mobile
[09:01:53] <DansVC> hi, i have a problem
[09:02:09] <duch_kazatel> i do too: not enough caffeine yet.
[09:02:10] <duch_kazatel> :)\
[09:02:14] <DansVC> how to stop a loop without limit?
[09:02:36] <SprkDev> why doesn't bootstrap modal work after the modal is clicked for second time
[09:02:36] <ocx> NoiseEee: here is the code, can someone tell me how things are saved? http://pastie.org/8964558
[09:02:38] <duch_kazatel> DansVC you want to breat out after a condition has been met?
[09:02:42] <SprkDev> how to fix?
[09:02:52] <duch_kazatel> *break
[09:02:59] <NoiseEee> i have no idea ocx
[09:03:08] <ocx> duch_kazatel: ?
[09:03:09] <duch_kazatel> ocx it's a caching thing.
[09:03:19] <ocx> which line duch_kazatel
[09:03:29] <DansVC> no, simplisly I have a code that select all html caracters so it make a double loop and now i dont know how to stop
[09:03:34] <duch_kazatel> ocx in the HTML.
[09:03:41] <duch_kazatel> ocx the browser caches in.
[09:03:44] <duch_kazatel> ocx not you.
[09:03:58] <duch_kazatel> DansVC "so it make a double loop" - fiddle it please?
[09:04:08] <DansVC> thats the problem
[09:04:12] <ocx> so you mena on the mobile phones the app is being cached? i am not using a browser on the mobile phones
[09:04:15] <ocx> its a webview
[09:04:33] <DansVC> I have a code in jsddle and if i close the browser i lose my code :C
[09:04:35] <duch_kazatel> ocx not sure how webview works, but I wouldn't be susprised if it has some kind of caching setup.
[09:04:59] <ocx> duch_kazatel: you mean in my code there is saving or whatover, all is being cached are you sure?
[09:05:04] <duch_kazatel> DansVC woah you mean it's locked up right now in the fiddle?
[09:05:12] <DansVC> yes
[09:05:17] <duch_kazatel> ocx might be - not sure how webview works.
[09:05:30] <ocx> duch_kazatel: if i remove the app and reinstall the configuration stays the same
[09:05:40] <duch_kazatel> DansVC Don't think you can stop that without forcing the browser to close.
[09:05:46] <DansVC> :s
[09:05:54] <DansVC> I will lose all my work
[09:06:10] <duch_kazatel> ocx i'd go read to see what sort of caching/saving the webview does.
[09:06:32] <duch_kazatel> DansVC do you have a previous version?
[09:06:40] <DansVC> no
[09:06:47] <duch_kazatel> ouch
[09:06:52] <DansVC> :s
[09:07:18] <DansVC> this have sometimes appened and I lose 2 hours of work
[09:07:53] <DansVC> no way right=?
[09:07:55] <duch_kazatel> DansVC i'm kind of surprised the browser is letting you run those scripts in the first place.  it should catch it.
[09:08:15] <DansVC> :(
[09:08:24] <duch_kazatel> DansVC the browser it totally locked, right?
[09:08:29] <DansVC> yes
[09:08:33] <DansVC> no console
[09:08:54] <DansVC> no fullscreen, no input
[09:09:34] <DansVC> and if i close I won't be able to reload that :S
[09:09:43] <duch_kazatel> DansVC yeah, the browser is totally locked.  i'd start searching google to see if there's a way to arbitrarily stop javascript execution, but you may not have that option.
[09:09:57] <duch_kazatel> unless NoiseEee has an ide.
[09:09:59] <duch_kazatel> *idea
[09:12:20] <SprkDev> why doesn't bootstrap modal work after the modal is clicked for second time
[09:12:55] <NoiseEee> SprkDev: essentially because of your code
[09:13:45] <SprkDev> what could it be though. I have the same code from getbootstrap.com and the modal window loads first time. Why not second time?
[09:15:00] <NoiseEee> SprkDev: not sure, fiddle it and maybe someone will take a peek
[09:15:25] <DansVC> someone know how to stop the script?
[09:16:27] <thebope> Has anyone used inlineedit.js?
[09:16:42] <thebope> It's a jquery library
[09:16:53] <beancurd> SprkDev: try triggering the modal in the console, and see if that changes anything.
[09:17:05] <thebope> I'm trying to find which part of it is stopping the enter button from working in a textarea
[09:17:22] <duch_kazatel> DansVC looks like you're SOL at this point.  moral of the story: save early and often.
[09:17:26] <duch_kazatel> and always make a backup.
[09:17:38] <DansVC> :(
[09:18:04] <duch_kazatel> DansVC what is your code doing anyway?
[09:18:36] <DansVC> put a ' in the all words
[09:18:52] <duch_kazatel> o.o why would you dop that with javascript and not server-side?
[09:19:01] <duch_kazatel> of course that's going to be slow.
[09:19:31] <DansVC> cause it have a input
[09:19:58] <DansVC> and I don't have a server-side :C
[09:20:02] <duch_kazatel> you mean you're doing it to input text?
[09:20:44] <DansVC> like you write something and it "translate" to ' '
[09:21:26] <duch_kazatel> it replaces everything with ' '?  not following
[09:21:42] <duch_kazatel> give an example of a before and an after
[09:22:17] <DansVC> like you write: My name is Daniel >> 'My' 'name' 'is' 'Daniel'
[09:22:29] <duch_kazatel> oh.
[09:23:09] <DansVC> duch_kazatel you are a web designer?
[09:23:15] <duch_kazatel> I'm a developer, yeah.
[09:23:19] <DansVC> :D
[09:23:32] <DansVC> can you give your opinion about my website=?
[09:24:08] <masterkiller1> hello, i have a form and i have a function that prevents the default submit, and instead creates a popup window via ajax request. $('id').submit(function(e){ e.preventDefault():... i am using .on() to see when a button is clicked on the ajax popup and it then should submit the form. however the first function is being fired again, preventing submit and instead fires the popup again. according to https://api.jquery.com/submit/
[09:24:08] <duch_kazatel> you asked me a while ago - you had that crazy click/drag nav thing, right?
[09:24:25] <DansVC> duch :D
[09:24:31] <DansVC> wait
[09:24:37] <duch_kazatel> DansVC also, you just want to surround each word with quotes?
[09:24:47] <DansVC> yes
[09:24:51] <DansVC> for now
[09:25:09] <DansVC> duch :D now i remeber you, you are from America right?
[09:25:14] <duch_kazatel> yep
[09:28:45] <Sylario> I have a set default problem with datepicker : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22615106/setdefaults-function-for-jquery-ui-not-called-correctly
[09:29:28] <cortexman> i'm using this jquery.caret plugin and it doesn't seem to work in chrome https://github.com/acdvorak/jquery.caret
[09:29:43] <cortexman> it changes the "caret" "value" but the caret itself disappears :(
[09:29:48] <cortexman> i.e., $("textarea").caret(2)
[09:31:34] <cortexman> also tried this to no avail $("textarea")[0].setSelectionRange(2,2)
[09:32:49] <cortexman> these methods both set the "caret position" but the damn thing isn't blinking!
[09:35:08] <Ericx2x> hey guys what is the best place to purchase domain names?
[09:35:48] <Jattenalle> Ericx2x, i like godaddy, they're nice for domain hosting, i've heard they're pretty bad for site-hosting though
[09:35:58] <Jattenalle> Ericx2x, "best" is a bit vague
[09:36:23] <Jattenalle> it depends on what you want to do, and what principles you have (ie: some people refuse to do business with american companies, etc)
[09:36:27] <duch_kazatel> bummer for DansVC - he shouldn't have left.
[09:36:37] <Ericx2x> im looking for cheapness
[09:36:42] <Ericx2x> is godaddy the cheapest?
[09:36:57] <Ericx2x> i need a simple wordpress site
[09:36:58] <Jattenalle> Ericx2x, they're all about the same, .com ~$12/yr
[09:37:26] <Jattenalle> but that's just the domain, if you want a webhost as well it's more along the lines of $5-$10/month for the webhosting
[09:37:28] <Jattenalle> .com remains the same
[09:38:16] <richardjs> Ericx2x, a couple other domain name registrars you'll hear thrown around are namecheap.com (who I use) and ghandi.net
[09:38:20] <Ericx2x> i have webhosting already
[09:38:24] <duch_kazatel> cort can you setup a working example?
[09:38:36] <duch_kazatel> err, cortexman
[09:38:45] <Jattenalle> Ericx2x, ah, then it doesnt matter much which domain host you pick.. as long as it has a proper DNS control panel :P
[09:38:46] <richardjs> They're mostly the same price whever you go
[09:38:47] <duch_kazatel> oh he left.
[09:39:01] <richardjs> wherever*
[09:39:18] <Ericx2x> namecheap looks good
[09:39:22] <Ericx2x> i save a dollar :)
[09:39:25] <Jattenalle> Ericx2x, also, you can change your domainhost anytime you want, you own the domain, not the company you "bought it" from
[09:40:48] <Jattenalle> but yeah i like godaddy, they have a nice DNS control panel and if you use their DNS it supports wildcard subdomains out of the box, which is nice
[09:42:36] <Trieste> Hi, how can I make sure a function runs after an image has been loaded, whether it's already finished loading or not?
[09:43:13] <duch_kazatel> Trieste bind to that image's "load" event
[09:44:37] <Trieste> duch_kazatel: yeah, that doesn't work if the image loads before I attach the load listener
[09:45:06] <duch_kazatel> without seeing your code, it's hard to help.
[09:45:08] <bberry> blegh. i cant decide the best way to select radio buttons to check them programmatically
[09:45:40] <bberry> do they really all need id's?
[09:45:50] <duch_kazatel> bberry huh?  no.
[09:45:53] <duch_kazatel> you can select classes.
[09:46:05] <Trieste> duch_kazatel: there's no code, just a HTML file with images :)
[09:46:09] <bberry> ideally id select by value
[09:46:16] <duch_kazatel> bberry don't do that.
[09:46:25] <bberry> yeah... meh.
[09:46:27] <duch_kazatel> bberry select by class - you can select by value, but it's slow.
[09:46:33] <bberry> kk
[09:46:42] <duch_kazatel> Trieste so you don't have any javascript written?
[09:46:55] <Trieste> duch_kazatel: if the image is loaded by the time I run ".on("load", function(){ whatever });", the function doesn't fire
[09:47:18] <duch_kazatel> Trieste right.
[09:47:26] <bberry> duch_kazatel: if none of my radio buttons share state, isnt that basically the same as IDs?
[09:47:38] <duch_kazatel> Trieste so you'd need to write your function in a way that can run before and after the load.
[09:47:54] <Trieste> duch_kazatel: how do I do that?
[09:47:55] <duch_kazatel> bberry you mean selecting by valie?
[09:48:00] <bberry> no, by class
[09:48:13] <duch_kazatel> bberry you'd give them all a shared class.
[09:48:22] <duch_kazatel> instead of doing unique classes - what are you selecting on?
[09:48:31] <duch_kazatel> Trieste I don't know - what is your code trying to actually accomplish?
[09:49:00] <bberry> duch_kazatel: oh, yah i select the group of radio buttons by class. but if i want to programmatically set "foo" radio button to 'checked' im not sure how to select that specific radio button
[09:49:24] <Trieste> duch_kazatel: I need to set an element's min-height to be the same as the image's height - can't do that until the image has finished loading
[09:49:27] <duch_kazatel> use an ID or class - avoid attribute selectors when you can avoid it.
[09:49:33] <bberry> kk
[09:49:49] <duch_kazatel> Trieste then bind to the load event for the images and go from there, instead of relying on race conditions.
[09:49:59] <Trieste> duch_kazatel: if the image is loaded by the time I run ".on("load", function(){ whatever });", the function doesn't fire
[09:50:28] <duch_kazatel> Trieste right - you wouldn't put your code in an IIFE.
[09:50:39] <duch_kazatel> err, wait, sorry, long morning.
[09:50:41] <Trieste> and I can't seem to be able to find a way whether the image has already loaded, so that I'd run the function, or not, so that I'd attach the listener
[09:51:03] <duch_kazatel> Trieste why not wait until the window load event and select from there?
[09:52:50] <Trieste> duch_kazatel: window.onload() fires after everything's loaded? I thought it did when the DOM was ready
[09:53:19] <duch_kazatel> $(window).on('load
[09:53:27] <duch_kazatel> $(window).on('load', function(){});
[09:53:40] <duch_kazatel> that fires when everything has finished loading, which waits for image.s
[09:53:54] <ocx> any idea when <button data-role="button" data-icon="gear">Settings</button> the gear icon is not seen?
[09:54:01] <Trieste> duch_kazatel: ah, didn't know that
[09:54:34] <Sylario> I have a problem, i think related to loading order(?), with jquery UI and the setDefault of the datepicker : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22615106/setdefaults-function-for-jquery-ui-not-called-correctly
[09:54:48] <Trieste> duch_kazatel: well that's not ideal, as it will slow it down a bit, but I think I can live with that
[09:54:53] <Trieste> thanks
[09:55:17] <duch_kazatel> Trieste of course.
[09:55:38] <DansVC> hi :D
[09:56:10] <duch_kazatel> DansVC http://jsfiddle.net/wfs6e/
[09:56:13] <duch_kazatel> you're welcome.
[09:56:40] <DansVC> kk duch
[09:56:53] <SprkDev> finally fixed.
[09:56:56] <ocx> where should i put the icons folder of jqm
[09:58:22] <krambiorix> hi, what am i doing wrong with this autocomplete?? The autocomplete ul doesn't have li's ... http://jsbin.com/nofuzofo/1/
[09:59:00] <DansVC> krambiorix you have not any input ?.?
[09:59:35] <krambiorix> DansVC, my input element is in my html
[09:59:50] <DansVC> no it's not
[10:00:05] <DansVC> this is what shows: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head>   <meta charset="utf-8">   <title>JS Bin</title> </head> <body>  </body> </html>
[10:00:16] <krambiorix> DansVC, yes, ok, but it's not a working example
[10:00:36] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix fuinctioning examples are pretty important.
[10:00:44] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, linking us to the result doesn't make much sense.
[10:01:45] <krambiorix> yes, i know, but in this case i can't
[10:04:33] <krambiorix> and i just don't know where to look for the problem
[10:04:58] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, maybe one of you saw the mistake instantly
[10:11:51] <DansVC> this is a quite died
[10:12:55] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:13:54] <DansVC> duch_kazatel do you have your own website?
[10:14:23] <duch_kazatel> I have a few kicking around.  nothing noteworthy of my own.  i do work for a major company.
[10:14:42] <DansVC> wht's the company?
[10:14:47] <duch_kazatel> I'd rather not say :)
[10:14:53] <DansVC> :C
[10:14:58] <DansVC> ok :D
[10:15:00] <duch_kazatel> if you're not in the US, it's likely that you haven't heard of us.
[10:15:14] <DansVC> I can seacrh it
[10:15:15] <DansVC> :D
[10:15:32] <Jattenalle> duch_kazatel works for a black ops site! confirmed! also half-life 3! ;)
[10:15:46] <duch_kazatel> lol it's a privacy thing.  just not quite comfortable with sharing that kind of info tbh.
[10:15:54] <DansVC> :o
[10:16:01] <Jattenalle> haha, i'm just poking fun :) i understand
[10:16:28] <DansVC> he think that I will rapt him
[10:16:30] <DansVC> :C
[10:16:55] <duch_kazatel> not really - just tryin' to keep my online identity separate from my other stuff is all :)
[10:17:06] <DansVC> (rapt = kidnap)
[10:17:30] <DansVC> :o rape = kidnap
[10:19:09] <DansVC> duch_kazatel in U.S. you are obligated to study for 12 years, right?
[10:21:06] <duch_kazatel> 13, and yes.
[10:21:16] <duch_kazatel> or prove proficiency.
[10:21:18] <DansVC> 13 years :o
[10:21:27] <duch_kazatel> kindergarten through 12th grade.
[10:22:01] <ocx> is JQM literally so slow? it takes like 1 sec to toggle a menu
[10:22:15] <ocx> when loaded on brwoser it is fast, when loaded on mobile it is freaking slow
[10:22:18] <duch_kazatel> ocx not usually that slow.  have any weird selectors going on?
[10:23:02] <krambiorix> any idea how i can debug autocomplete?
[10:23:11] <ocx> duch_kazatel: http://pastie.org/8964844 thats my code mainly
[10:23:58] <duch_kazatel> ocx any way to bind those document listeners a little further down?
[10:24:13] <ocx> duch_kazatel: which line
[10:24:25] <duch_kazatel> all of these:  document.addEventListener("urbanairship.registration", onRegistration, false)
[10:24:35] <duch_kazatel> also: why not use jquery's event binding?
[10:25:39] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, can you please take a look at my autocomplete... Maybe you see something that's not correct...
[10:25:40] <ocx> duch_kazatel: i am suspecting the iframe is doing some bad stuff coz if the code is loaded wihtout the iframe it is not slow
[10:26:19] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix i'm not very familiar with autocomplete, sorry.
[10:26:27] <duch_kazatel> ocx that would be part of it.
[10:27:13] <ocx> duch_kazatel: solution?
[10:28:12] <duch_kazatel> ocx what's in the iframe?
[10:28:19] <ocx> a website...
[10:28:51] <duch_kazatel> ocx sorry - i'll be honest and point out I didn't read all of your code.  I skimmed it for things that might jump out at me.
[10:29:08] <DansVC> ocx kakakkakaka
[10:29:37] <duch_kazatel> one thing that jumped out was that you were binding a lot of event listeners to the document.
[10:30:51] <ocx> DansVC: what was that?
[10:31:04] <DansVC> your troll kakaka
[10:31:28] <ocx> wtv that means
[10:31:40] <DansVC> forget
[10:32:09] <DansVC> I was just laught about your answare
[10:32:35] <ocx> ok

[10:34:37] <b-ot> DansVC: ♩ Say Yeah by Diego Miranda and Peetah Morgan ▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮
[10:35:13] <DansVC> kk so many peoople :o
[10:39:53] <DansVC> This is always this, nobody for one hour?
[10:39:56] <DansVC> hi fandi
[10:39:59] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:40:05] <duch_kazatel> oh, is it always this quiet?
[10:40:06] <duch_kazatel> it can be.
[10:41:12] <DansVC> duch_kazatel I find a freeze function what do this fuction exacly?
[10:41:17] <DansVC> do you know?
[10:41:26] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:41:48] <DansVC> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze
[10:42:08] <duch_kazatel> did you read the description?
[10:42:35] <DansVC> yes but i dont understand :s
[10:42:45] <duch_kazatel> what don't you understand?
[10:43:03] <duch_kazatel> the summary explains it pretty succinctly.
[10:43:25] <darkbasic> $.prototype.closest.call($("input")[4], "form")
[10:43:25] <darkbasic> TypeError: Object #<HTMLInputElement> has no method 'pushStack'
[10:43:25] <darkbasic> Why do I get such an error? If I do $($("input")[4]).closest("form") it works flawlessly
[10:43:53] <duch_kazatel> darkbasic don't call the underlying method - use the second one.
[10:44:05] <duch_kazatel> I assume you're trying to avoid wrapping jquery in jquery?
[10:44:16] <darkbasic> duch_kazatel: exactly
[10:44:49] <DansVC> duch_kazatel the freeze stop functions it is?
[10:45:03] <duch_kazatel> you could do $("input:eq(4)").closest("form"), darkbasic
[10:45:06] <duch_kazatel> DansVC no.
[10:45:22] <duch_kazatel> DansVC it prevents adding and removing properties from an object.
[10:45:31] <DansVC> oh
[10:45:45] <DansVC> now i understtod
[10:45:55] <duch_kazatel> darkbasic there's also .eq(4) - $("input").eq(4).closest("form")
[10:45:57] <DansVC> no dont work :s
[10:46:14] <duch_kazatel> DansVC huh?  what are you trying to do?  can you setup a fiddle?
[10:46:33] <darkbasic> duch_kazatel: thanks
[10:49:55] <duch_kazatel> DansVC http://jsfiddle.net/9uqcG/
[10:49:57] <duch_kazatel> works just fine.
[10:51:28] <DansVC> no
[10:51:44] <DansVC> cause i guess freeze is to DOM
[10:51:49] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:52:03] <duch_kazatel> freeze is for objects.
[10:52:26] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to use it for?  a code example would be helpful.
[10:53:03] <DansVC> http://jsfiddle.net/DansVC/Cmu7g/
[10:54:06] <DansVC> but stop really everythink all other functions and animations stop for a while and when finished everything comes back to the normal
[10:54:15] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:54:21] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to stop an animation?
[10:54:29] <DansVC> not only
[10:54:34] <DansVC> stop all fuctions
[10:54:45] <duch_kazatel> DansVC that... doesn't make sense.
[10:54:55] <DansVC> why?
[10:55:01] <duch_kazatel> also, Object.freeze() is only for javascript object, not jquery object.
[10:55:26] <duch_kazatel> DansVC a more real-world example would be helpful.  are you trying to prevent that browser crash issue from before?
[10:55:37] <DansVC> wait
[10:55:52] <duch_kazatel> DansVC because "stop everything" isn't very realistic.
[10:56:58] <DansVC> :s
[10:57:21] <duch_kazatel> so expalain what you're actually trying to accomplish - what problem are you really trying to solve?
[10:57:36] <duch_kazatel> ie - why do you think you need to "stop all functions"
[10:57:42] <DansVC> in my website
[10:57:52] <DansVC> i have the notice function
[10:58:06] <DansVC> that make appens a mensage
[10:58:20] <DansVC> are you see it?
[10:58:27] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:58:43] <DansVC> http://jsfiddle.net/DansVC/4EhCr/
[10:58:52] <DansVC> when you make a move
[10:58:59] <duch_kazatel> woah dude no.
[10:59:10] <DansVC> it shows a arrow
[10:59:11] <duch_kazatel> small use-case, not the entire page/
[10:59:13] <DansVC> whit a mensage
[11:00:07] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to prevent a function from running?
[11:01:31] <DansVC> yes
[11:01:42] <DansVC> but are all function just for 2000 ms
[11:02:18] <duch_kazatel> DansVC so you want to clear all timeouts.
[11:02:31] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.clearTimeout
[11:03:37] <DansVC> i can clear all timeouts?
[11:03:55] <duch_kazatel> just linked you to the article about it.
[11:06:58] <DansVC> and to come back?
[11:07:56] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to manually set the all back up.
[11:08:08] <DansVC> ok
[11:08:16] <duch_kazatel> it'd be smart to create 2 functions - one that starts all your timesouts, and another that clears them.
[11:08:21] <duch_kazatel> not sure why you're using timeouts
[11:08:55] <DansVC> i dont use timeouts, i use a lot of functions and animates
[11:09:21] <duch_kazatel> then everything i just said doesn't help.
[11:09:26] <duch_kazatel> timeouts and animations are different.
[11:09:55] <DansVC> are? animatios does not use timeouts?
[11:10:30] <duch_kazatel> ... are you using jquery animations?
[11:11:05] <DansVC> somes
[11:11:15] <DansVC> i find this:
[11:11:30] <DansVC> .on() /.off() and .unbind()
[11:11:32] <duch_kazatel> you're not making any sense. are you trying to stop jquery animations?  are you trying to prevent a function from firing?
[11:11:33] <DansVC> this works?
[11:11:46] <DansVC> animations and functions
[11:11:48] <duch_kazatel> .on() and .off() remove event bindings, don't use .unbind()
[11:11:49] <dean[h]> Hi all. I'm trying to use this plugin: https://github.com/matthewlein/jQuery-jSlots/blob/master/jquery.jSlots.js Unfortunately I can't programatically call the playSlots method. How would I adjust the design pattern (in the most quickest and jacky way possible) to expose the methods of the base object?
[11:12:03] <DansVC> why not?
[11:12:42] <duch_kazatel> because .off() does the same thing and is preferred
[11:12:53] <duch_kazatel> .on() and .off() are event bindings.  .stop() will stop animations.
[11:13:23] <DansVC> but off remove all call functions?
[11:13:30] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:13:40] <DansVC> like: $("*").off()
[11:13:43] <duch_kazatel> DansVC what you should do is leave your bindings in place, but test for a condition and then run your functions based on that.
[11:13:45] <duch_kazatel> do not do that.
[11:14:14] <duch_kazatel> and that wouldn't work anyway.
[11:16:34] <jop008> Hi a position question how to put the facebook button to the right of the page? http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/227/
[11:17:22] <duch_kazatel> jop008 read their docs.
[11:17:33] <jop008> their?
[11:17:33] <DansVC_> soz
[11:17:41] <duch_kazatel> unless you're just asking how to float that container to the right.
[11:17:43] <jop008> googled for hours on this
[11:17:50] <duch_kazatel> jop008 clarify what you want.
[11:17:57] <jop008> yes float the container to the right
[11:18:25] <DansVC_> s
[11:18:32] <jop008> at the top at the rigth with some space around it a nice corner is the icing on the cake
[11:19:15] <duch_kazatel> jop008 remove the positioning and apply a float: right.
[11:19:23] <duch_kazatel> and set the width accordingly.
[11:19:45] <jop008> I tried taht as well of courrse
[11:22:27] <duch_kazatel> jop008 it'll be something like this actually: http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/228/
[11:24:48] <jop008> not that intuitive to me
[11:24:55] <duch_kazatel> very intuitive.
[11:24:57] <duch_kazatel> :)
[11:25:02] <jop008> will the width be scaled on other devices?
[11:25:17] <jop008> or 340 is absolute width?
[11:25:20] <duch_kazatel> click and drag the width around and tell me for yourself.
[11:25:28] <duch_kazatel> the 340 is the width of that container.
[11:25:42] <duch_kazatel> *the container of the like button.
[11:25:48] <jop008> on every devide it is 340?
[11:25:57] <duch_kazatel> dunno.
[11:26:03] <duch_kazatel> you have to constrain that containing element in some way.
[11:26:52] <jop008> is the width size from left 0 to 340 ?
[11:27:08] <jop008> So 340 pixels it looks wider on my big screen
[11:27:14] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:27:25] <jop008> or is it the size othe like button itself
[11:27:40] <duch_kazatel> inspect it and learn.
[11:28:24] <jop008> Okay
[11:34:51] <DansVC_> duch
[11:35:10] <DansVC_> duch_kazatel, I find this: callbackFunctionTrue();
[11:36:33] <jop008> how to find out the url of a page?
[11:36:53] <jop008> for fb like the full path is needed that's why
[11:37:26] <duch_kazatel> jop008 huh?
[11:37:33] <duch_kazatel> DansVC_ huh?
[11:37:39] <jop008> var pathname = window.location.pathname;
[11:37:55] <duch_kazatel> jop008 you want the whole url?
[11:38:07] <duch_kazatel> because that's a quick search on google.
[11:39:00] <duch_kazatel> or, hell, console.log(window.location) will tell you a lot.
[11:42:41] <DansVC_> duch_kazatel do you think that https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/ can help me?
[11:43:44] <duch_kazatel> DansVC_ I think your application has some major design flaws.
[11:43:48] <duch_kazatel> jQuery.Callbacks()
[11:43:53] <duch_kazatel> that won't help much
[11:44:24] <DansVC_> ok
[11:44:36] <DansVC_> I have to try another thing
[11:47:37] <DansVC_> duch_kazatel what do you think about put a help icon in the right side to show helps?
[11:48:13] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:48:35] <duch_kazatel> you mean to help users figure out your site?
[11:48:54] <DansVC_> no,
[11:49:36] <DansVC_> have a icon in the right side that show helps when they are starting
[11:49:54] <DansVC_> And show some mensages to start
[11:50:16] <duch_kazatel> how is that distinct from what I said?
[11:50:22] <duch_kazatel> what are you helping them with?
[11:50:47] <DansVC_> soz I translate bad
[11:50:51] <DansVC_> yes kk
[11:52:12] <duch_kazatel> yes what?  you are trying to help them learn how to use your site?
[11:52:34] <duch_kazatel> do you want lots of people to use the site?  is this a place you want to become popular?
[12:40:56] <TheEternalAbyss> hi.. i'm confused... in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/TheEternalAbyss/W5zHe/ the function call works as expected. On load, it automatically selects the first option in the list. In my page it only works if the alert is uncommented... otherwise nada. Any ideas as to why?
[12:53:03] <r1chard> Anyone here have a quick opinion about Angular JS?
[12:56:20] <DansVC> r1chard I know like very much
[12:58:39] <r1chard> Aight.
[13:12:15] <TheEternalAbyss> so no ideas why the dom only executes after an alert is triggered?
[13:12:38] <duch_kazatel> what's up?
[13:12:51] <TheEternalAbyss> hi.. i'm confused... in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/TheEternalAbyss/W5zHe/ the function call works as expected. On load, it automatically selects the first option in the list. In my page it only works if the alert is uncommented... otherwise nada. Any ideas as to why?  <--
[13:13:14] <TheEternalAbyss> it works perfectly fine in jsfiddle. in my dev server it only runs if I uncomment that alert
[13:13:36] <duch_kazatel> why are you wrapping that in a jquery doc ready?
[13:13:47] <duch_kazatel> you shouldn't need to use two.
[13:13:50] <TheEternalAbyss> cause I thought that was the issue in my dev server.
[13:14:02] <TheEternalAbyss> yea in fact I've removed it on the dev server but that doesn't resolve anything
[13:14:13] <TheEternalAbyss> i just never updated the fiddle
[13:14:21] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/W5zHe/1/
[13:14:28] <duch_kazatel> so this doesn't work?
[13:14:53] <duch_kazatel> interesting.  any console errors or anything?
[13:15:00] <TheEternalAbyss> no errors :\
[13:15:50] <duch_kazatel> any frameworks/libraries/etc you're using?
[13:16:05] <duch_kazatel> you stepped through and made sure everything is selecting right, etc?
[13:16:16] <TheEternalAbyss> just jquery, jqueryui and google charts is loaded previously
[13:16:55] <duch_kazatel> and the dropdown isn't getting loaded via any of those, right?
[13:17:11] <duch_kazatel> like, you tried moving the script down before </body> ?
[13:17:18] <duch_kazatel> i know it's in a doc ready, but it wouldn't hurt.
[13:17:41] <TheEternalAbyss> yes, i tested it in console, in jsfiddle and manually selected items and getting an output to make sure i was selecting the correct one. As long as the alert is triggered it'll select the correct value, and call my function
[13:17:50] <TheEternalAbyss> no the dropdown is loaded dynamically seperately
[13:17:57] <TheEternalAbyss> oh...
[13:18:02] <duch_kazatel> :)
[13:18:10] <duch_kazatel> the alert is allowing the document to finish loading most likely.
[13:18:47] <TheEternalAbyss> maybe I should move the dropdown functionc all then...
[13:18:58] <TheEternalAbyss> let me try that
[13:22:03] <TheEternalAbyss> hmm
[13:22:38] <rofel> hey i am using this https://github.com/peterwillcn/rails4-autocomplete , and the autocomplete text is above the text field
[13:22:46] <rofel> i thought it would be a dropdown
[13:23:26] <TheEternalAbyss> duch_kazatel: no the dropdown is populated on document ready. always has been and the manipulation is called afterwards
[13:23:30] <TheEternalAbyss> so it's not that
[13:23:49] <duch_kazatel> TheEternalAbyss and you are 100% certain of that?
[13:24:02] <TheEternalAbyss> yes I can put the whole mess of js in the fiddle
[13:24:30] <TheEternalAbyss> my function call for populating the dropdown is the first functionc all of the page
[13:24:51] <duch_kazatel> that window alert is allowing something else to finish.
[13:25:06] <TheEternalAbyss> there are like 3 or 4 after that and then my other two lines that aren't getting executed
[13:25:15] <TheEternalAbyss> yes i just don't know what :\
[13:26:09] <duch_kazatel> funk
[13:26:11] <duch_kazatel> *funky
[13:26:24] <TheEternalAbyss> hmm
[13:26:50] <TheEternalAbyss> ok if I trigger the page manually i get a TypeError: a is undefined in a function
[13:27:02] <TheEternalAbyss> let me put the whole script in the fiddle
[13:27:11] <duch_kazatel> uh, how many lines is it?
[13:27:24] <TheEternalAbyss> not many
[13:27:29] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[13:27:38] <TheEternalAbyss> 20 tops
[13:28:37] <TheEternalAbyss> http://jsfiddle.net/TheEternalAbyss/W5zHe/2
[13:28:57] <TheEternalAbyss> it's saying that error on line 13
[13:29:46] <duch_kazatel> $('#smallButton').click(function() { ?
[13:30:29] <TheEternalAbyss> no, v4_loadGraphiteGraphs('M', selectedOption);
[13:31:06] <duch_kazatel> where's the code for v4_loadGraphiteGraphs ?
[13:31:23] <TheEternalAbyss> it's an ajax call. I can show you. standby
[13:31:39] <duch_kazatel> can you setup the fiddle to work like your production setup?
[13:31:58] <duch_kazatel> wait - in an ajax call?
[13:32:09] <duch_kazatel> hoooold the phone - clarify what you mean by that.
[13:32:44] <TheEternalAbyss> http://jsfiddle.net/TheEternalAbyss/W5zHe/3
[13:33:20] <TheEternalAbyss> that's what I mean. that function is in an external js file included on load
[13:33:34] <TheEternalAbyss> which executes a php script
[13:34:12] <duch_kazatel> your error means that something isn't finished loading when you execute your code.
[13:34:29] <duch_kazatel> you sure your ajax isn't stirring up some cool rade conditions?
[13:34:32] <duch_kazatel> *race
[13:34:45] <TheEternalAbyss> you know I can't say one way or another
[13:34:56] <duch_kazatel> something tells me that's your issue
[13:34:57] <TheEternalAbyss> i don't think it should be doing that
[13:35:13] <TheEternalAbyss> because this came up now and not before
[13:35:36] <duch_kazatel> remember - just because code is placed after an ajax call does not mean the results of the ajax call are available to it.
[13:35:41] <TheEternalAbyss> and that ajax call is usually only called onClick
[13:36:15] <TheEternalAbyss> i would think if the ajax returns successfully it means it ended it's execution
[13:36:44] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:37:01] <duch_kazatel> are you putting your logic in the success callback of the ajax call?
[13:37:46] <TheEternalAbyss> no, i'm just trying to understand ajax logic. or pgramming in general. in my experience a program returns the data I requested upon completion of it's execution
[13:37:49] <duch_kazatel> remember, ajax is asyncronous - the code order doesn't matter in that case.  when you fire off an ajax call, you're shipping off a request and keep trucking on.
[13:38:05] <TheEternalAbyss> sure but it's returning data to me
[13:38:11] <duch_kazatel> just because code exists below the ajax call does not mean that the ajax call has completed in time.,
[13:38:14] <TheEternalAbyss> if i see all my data it should be done no?
[13:38:44] <duch_kazatel> yes, but your code isn't waiting.  any code that relies on that ajax call to complete should be in the success or done callback.
[13:39:51] <TheEternalAbyss> ok.. how can I execute a function call and know if everything i need is done without going into the success?
[13:41:21] <TheEternalAbyss> that specific ajax call has little to do with the rest of the page's functionality. I need to basically load one thing on page load and let the user manipulate it afterwards
[13:43:02] <TheEternalAbyss> cause really if i can get that behavior the alert was giving me without the alert than I'm golden
[13:46:16] <NoiseEee> TheEternalAbyss: you can hack a setTimeout but it seems you're misunderstanding a fundamental part about javascript and async.
[13:46:46] <TheEternalAbyss> i may be, but I just need this to execute properly
[13:47:00] <NoiseEee> well you haven't written it properly, so...
[13:47:10] <NoiseEee> if you don't want to change what you've written, add a setTimeout
[13:47:18] <TheEternalAbyss> what isn't written properly
[13:47:30] <fons2> Hello. I'm currently using animate.css (http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) for some of the animations on my site. I'm looking for a way to be able to disable the animations if the end user is on a mobile device. What would be the best way to approach this?
[13:47:54] <NoiseEee> TheEternalAbyss: your code, if you're not using callbacks / understanding async
[13:48:07] <TheEternalAbyss> mind being specific?
[13:48:18] <fons2> Modernizr is loaded on the site and I've read some articles talking about using it for that purpose
[13:48:20] <TheEternalAbyss> or providing a link that could explain it?
[13:48:42] <fons2> but if anyone can point me in the right direction (examples,articles,etc.) on how to go about doing so.
[13:49:50] <duch_kazatel> TheEternalAbyss i explained the async thing - any code that relies on data from the ajax call should be placed within that call's .success() or .done() callback.
[13:49:56] <NoiseEee> TheEternalAbyss: duch_kazatel has really explained it
[13:50:15] <fons2> This is the javascript which executes the animation. The animation is executed based on the scroll location. http://pastebin.com/reGDtjSa
[13:50:16] <TheEternalAbyss> yes but the funcitonality and user experience makes it impossible for me to do that
[13:50:21] <duch_kazatel> no it doesn't.
[13:50:28] <TheEternalAbyss> in this case it does
[13:50:33] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[13:50:37] <duch_kazatel> you need to abstract out.
[13:50:41] <TheEternalAbyss> believe what you want
[13:50:47] <TheEternalAbyss> i know what i'm going for here
[13:51:15] <TheEternalAbyss> and the loading certaind data on success would make the behaviors not do what I want
[13:51:29] <TheEternalAbyss> anyways, I'll figure it out
[13:51:33] <TheEternalAbyss> thanks
[13:51:47] <duch_kazatel> i really hate that reaction - "hey I don't understand how this works, help?" "Well, you need to change x, y, and z." "No I don't my use case is different.'
[13:51:57] <duch_kazatel> you can't go from novice to expert like that.
[13:52:24] <TheEternalAbyss> and you can't just assume all use case scenario fits the bill for that
[13:52:32] <TheEternalAbyss> I never said I disagreed with you
[13:52:41] <duch_kazatel> my "use case" is universal.
[13:52:45] <TheEternalAbyss> I'm just saying my use case is particular and I don't think it'll work
[13:52:45] <duch_kazatel> there is a reason you need to use the callbacks.
[13:52:58] <TheEternalAbyss> liek i said, I'll read up on it and figure it out
[13:53:27] <TheEternalAbyss> there is really no conflict here so I don't see why the butthurt
[13:53:54] <duch_kazatel> there isn't - I'm pointing out that you asked for help and said you didn'
[13:54:09] <duch_kazatel> *didn't know what you were doing, then suddenly acted like the solution can't be it.
[13:54:14] <duch_kazatel> like... that doesn't jive.
[13:54:33] <rofel> so i have an autocomplete field, but instead of sending the contents of the field back to the DB i want to send the corresponding ID, how can i do this?
[13:56:02] <TheEternalAbyss> well I just find it odd is all since the data it's pulling is nothing. it should overlap so much as to muck things up. Could definitely be a miscalculation on my part. No argument there. Just like i said before. in my past experience I never ran into such issues.
[13:56:14] <TheEternalAbyss> shouldn't*
[13:56:33] <duch_kazatel> probably because in the past you were always "beating" the race condition.
[13:56:44] <TheEternalAbyss> especially since it's giving me errors on something that is executing onClick
[13:57:07] <TheEternalAbyss> it's not executing in on page load
[13:57:25] <TheEternalAbyss> anywho, as said before I thank you for the help and will look into it
[13:59:15] <ocx> how can i change colors of jqm elements?
[14:00:07] <duch_kazatel> CSS?
[14:03:10] <krambiorix> i have a dialog on top of another dialog... How can i put the overlay above the parent dialog?
[14:03:10] <ocx> duch_kazatel: well it is not changing
[14:03:47] <duch_kazatel> ocx sounds like a specificity issue.
[14:03:51] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix z-index.
[14:03:55] <ocx> duch_kazatel: i another question, i have an iframe that i would like to get the focus when a page is loaded how can i do that
[14:08:27] <ocx> duch_kazatel: $(iframeID).focus();  can i do that
[14:08:36] <duch_kazatel> ocx Did you try?
[14:08:46] <duch_kazatel> (hint that probably won't work)
[14:08:50] <duch_kazatel> define "focud"
[14:08:51] <duch_kazatel> *focus
[14:08:59] <ocx> nop
[14:10:10] <ocx> duch_kazatel: focus() for iframe
[14:10:18] <NoiseEee> ocx: but what does that mean to focus an iframe?
[14:10:18] <duch_kazatel> ocx define "focus"
[14:10:34] <duch_kazatel> because focus is a concept for forms.
[14:10:44] <ocx> duch_kazatel: as if you clicked on the iframe
[14:10:50] <ocx> so you can scroll up and down
[14:10:53] <duch_kazatel> why would you do that?
[14:10:58] <ocx> phone
[14:11:04] <ocx> slide up and down
[14:11:16] <duch_kazatel> !xy
[14:11:32] <duch_kazatel> aww the bot doesn't have that one.  why are you loading things in an iframe in the first place?
[14:11:35] <duch_kazatel> this is really bizarre.
[14:11:46] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, zIndex doesn't work because i see that .ui-widget-overlay has : z-index: 2999 !important;
[14:12:13] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix your overlay has to be in the document after or have a higher z-index.
[14:12:21] <duch_kazatel> go with the latter option.
[14:16:19] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, higher zindex -> nope
[14:16:30] <duch_kazatel> why not?
[14:59:25] <Tomashe> how can i remove container children that is not id "x"
[16:30:19] <javalover> does anyone here know why <input type = "file"> has the text value "no file chosen" and I can't change the value...
[16:34:13] <systemfault> javalover: Of course you can’t…. or else you would have the biggest security flaw ever
[16:34:34] <javalover> ok well in that case I just want to make it presentable
[16:34:42] <javalover> all the work arounds say to hide it & use your own label
[16:34:51] <systemfault> That’s what I do.
[16:35:02] <javalover> is it a good idea to just hide it then such as this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/ZDgRG/
[16:35:20] <javalover> kk i'll do that
[16:35:26] <javalover> I always like to ask just to make sure i'm not doing something wrong
[16:35:41] <systemfault> javalover: Your code is weird.
[16:35:49] <javalover> not my code, googled that
[16:35:58] <systemfault> That’s crap then
[16:36:04] <systemfault> Give me a minute.
[16:36:19] <javalover> kk :-)
[16:39:19] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/ZDgRG/173/
[16:39:36] <javalover> i like it
[16:39:37] <javalover> it's all pink
[16:39:39] <systemfault> See… no JS
[16:40:03] <javalover> doesn't seem to display file name though..
[16:40:06] <javalover> but i can handle this on my own
[16:40:30] <systemfault> Right
[16:40:35] <javalover> so basically just hide the default
[16:40:44] <javalover> and then code naturally
[16:40:46] <systemfault> Yep
[16:40:53] <javalover> thx man that's a big help
[16:40:58] <systemfault> You’re welcome.
[16:42:01] <javalover> want some paypal?
[16:42:29] <systemfault> No thanks :)
[16:42:35] <systemfault> I was happy to help
[16:42:41] <javalover> hahaha good answer thx man honestly ty so much :-)
[16:42:47] <javalover> here i'll follow, like & honor you
[16:42:47] <CrowX-> my touchmove event works fine on chrome's emulation, but not on real smartphones
[16:42:52] <CrowX-> any idea why this could happen?
[16:42:53] <javalover> hi Crow
[16:42:58] <CrowX-> hi javalover
[16:43:01] <javalover> think about it
[16:43:25] <javalover> heres what i would do crow
[16:43:36] <javalover> make an output of any event that takes place
[16:43:46] <javalover> then look at the output on your phones browser page
[16:43:53] <javalover> to see what outputs are taking place..then use that one
[16:44:33] <javalover> least that's how I used to figure out key inputs for early j2me applications :-)
[16:44:45] <CrowX-> javalover, what kind of output is suitable for this?
[16:44:57] <javalover> although I will have to Google Crow
[16:45:04] <javalover> basically event listener for ANY EVENT
[16:45:09] <javalover> and then print the data for that event
[16:45:16] <CrowX-> k
[16:45:18] <javalover> then do the event & see what happens when you do it
[16:45:51] <javalover> it could just be the phone doesn't even call your touch event & maybe it just calls "click" for example
[16:46:06] <javalover> depends on the browser & what the developer determined to call
[17:51:52] <Jrizzlin> Is there any way to keep jquery from applying its styles to every single page of my site?
[17:52:29] <duch_kazatel> jquery doesn't apply any styles.
[17:52:29] <Jrizzlin> Im using it on a login form, and all subsequent pages get styles that same way
[17:52:40] <duch_kazatel> jquery UI and jquery Mobile apply styles, however.
[17:52:58] <Jrizzlin> Yeah, that's it
[17:53:04] <Jrizzlin> mobile
[17:53:37] <Jrizzlin> I have a mobile login screen but give users the option to go to the normal desktop site, but that page's style gets overwritten by the jquery mobile style
[17:54:07] <duch_kazatel> are you ajaxing in content?
[17:54:14] <Jrizzlin> Nope
[17:54:38] <Jrizzlin> The desktop site's CSS appears correctly after refresh, it's just the intial load that's funny
[17:54:59] <Jrizzlin> The load that's directed by the jquery mobile form
[17:55:10] <duch_kazatel> looks like that might be ajaxing content in for you then.
[17:55:50] <Jrizzlin> Any idea how to make it stop so I can apply my CSS to subdirectories without being overwritten?
[17:56:25] <duch_kazatel> maybe try adding data-ajax="false"
[17:56:42] <Jrizzlin> What tag do I put that in?
[18:02:21] <Jrizzlin> dutch_kazatel: Got it working by adding data-ajax="false" into my form. Thanks!
[18:58:12] <xaristax> Hi can someone give some reference about uploading a file to a server using javascript API File
[18:58:38] <xaristax> i know the File API is intended to work only local but is a way to upload a file this way?
[19:08:57] <jay> hello ben alman
[19:16:45] <Whirl3d> When checking the status of an input checkbox, is it better to use .attr() or .prop()?
[19:17:41] <snover> it’s better to just look at the property on the checkbox directly.
[19:17:47] <snover> checkbox.checked // yep!
[19:18:34] <jphase> I tend to use .is(':checked') personally
[19:18:46] <jphase> haven't really done a jsperf on it to see if it's better/worse though :\
[19:19:15] <snover> hint: using jquery methods will always be worse for performance than just accessing a property
[19:54:40] <ledestin> does $({id: 1}).prop('id', 2) trigger any events I can listen on?
[19:57:16] <Max-P> ledestin, Not that I know of. Pretty sure there's no standard event for property changes. Maybe you could trigger the event yourself instead, with .trigger() ?
[19:59:03] <ledestin> Max-P: I could call a function on .id assignment, but I don't know how.
[19:59:44] <Max-P> ledestin, Can you explain a bit more what you want to do exactly? I'm not sure I understand what you need
[20:00:15] <ledestin> Max-P: I want property assignment to cause an event I can listen on
[20:01:02] <ledestin> Max-P: the solutions I see are half-assed, like prop('id', 2).change();
[20:01:16] <Max-P> ledestin, $(...).trigger('update_id.custom');
[20:01:34] <Max-P> and then you can $(...).on('update_id.custom', function() {}); to get the event
[20:02:17] <ledestin> Max-P: thanks, but this solution sucks because if you assign in many places, you have to write it all again and not forget it
[20:02:55] <Max-P> ledestin, Well, there's nothing else you can do really
[20:02:57] <ledestin> Max-P: I actually found a different solution - redefining property set function for jquery
[20:03:54] <Max-P> That will work, but it's kind of a kludge unless you intend to make it very generic, and triggering an event on change on everything could be quite slow
[20:04:07] <Max-P> (it has to bubble up the tree everytime)
[20:05:10] <ledestin> Max-P: hmm, I guess :( then I could call trigger() from the plain object if I can somehow call a function on foo.id = 1
[20:05:49] <Max-P> ledestin, Object.observe()
[20:05:59] <ledestin> Max-P: ok, thanks
[20:06:02] <Max-P> But it's really new and probably terribly supported, especially on IE
[20:06:52] <ledestin> Max-P: ok. I can make a function to set it then and call it from everywhere
[20:07:08] <Max-P> Backbone Models do pretty much exactly what you want, but you end up calling .set() and .get() on it so either way you'll end up with having to rewrite everywhere
[20:07:18] <tw2113> anyone by chance have select2 experience?
[20:07:54] <ledestin> Max-P: ok, thanks for your help mate
[20:08:53] <kopasetik> i need to install qunit in the folder of whatever project i'm working on, right?
[20:18:17] <ledestin> Max-P: $foo.prop = function(key, val) { var ret = this._prop(key); console.log("key: " + key); return ret; };
[20:22:06] <Max-P> ledestin, Good idea, if you define the object once and set very often it will work.
[20:22:56] <Max-P> But I still hope you won't have to play too much with that code after because you'll regret not doing it right when needed. This fixes it, but it can become hard to maintain if you continue adding these
[20:44:01] * Velveeta_ paddles a canoe slowly through the room, and disappears over the edge of a waterfall.
[21:08:59] <Cache_Money> Is there a way to utilize the .resize() function but wait until they're done resizing? As opposed to getting a stream of callbacks while the user is resizing?
[21:14:22] <Jattenalle> Cache_Money, you mean you only want to trigger when the user is done?
[21:14:28] <Jattenalle> ie: when they let go of the mouse button
[21:15:45] <Jattenalle> .resizable({stop:function(){code here }});
[21:15:49] <Jattenalle> Cache_Money,  ^^
[21:16:32] <Jattenalle> Cache_Money, sorry, my bad.. read your question wrong.. .resize not .resizable
[21:27:39] <Cache_Money> Jattenalle: thanks
[21:28:19] <Cache_Money> Jattenalle: I decided to use this approach, instead of a stop function  http://gomakethings.com/javascript-resize-performance/
[21:28:34] <Jattenalle> the way i suggested with stop: wouldnt work
[21:28:39] <Jattenalle> it's for .resizable()
[21:28:43] <Jattenalle> not for .resize
[21:28:45] <Jattenalle> :(
[21:30:05] <Cache_Money> ahh
[21:30:09] <Cache_Money> thanks anyways :)
