[00:02:13] <TheBrayn> this looks like something oop is good for
[00:02:35] <TheBrayn> well, this looks like oop
[00:02:37] <TheBrayn> but in a strange way
[00:03:09] <wachpwnski> yah
[00:03:12] <wachpwnski> that is what I am using
[00:27:44] <wachpwnski> Isn't using $.fn.func a bad thing?

[00:36:52] <mazzachre> If I have a jquery object of an element (a td in this example) is it possible to find out what :nth() it was?
[00:37:40] <ravenzz> ?index @ mazzachre
[00:37:40] <bot-t> mazzachre, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[00:38:14] <jkarsrud> any jquery ui magicians in here?
[00:38:47] <ravenzz> ?ask @ jkarsrud
[00:38:48] <bot-t> jkarsrud, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:39:08] <jkarsrud> ravenzz: ehm, whatever
[00:39:17] <blackspotwiggins> jkarsrud, i warned you about the stairs bro
[00:39:31] <jkarsrud> blackspotwiggins: I know, I know :P
[00:40:38] <karstenk1977_> Hello
[00:40:59] <karstenk1977_> I try to get the selected date from a datepicker
[00:41:14] <karstenk1977_> why dowsnÂ´t this work :  jQuery("#datepicker2").datepicker({     onSelect: function() {       var currentDate = jQuery("#datepicker2").datepicker( "getDate" );       console.log(currentDate);     }   });
[00:42:44] <erdos> hello!
[00:43:43] <ravenzz> karstenk1977_ http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#method-dialog
[00:44:06] <erdos> will $(".test")[0] return a normal javascript DOM object?
[00:44:16] <erdos> the same as document.getElementById("test")
[00:44:35] <jrockjiggz> erdos: i believe so
[00:44:36] <erdos> because when i inspect the two in the debugger they are presented differently
[00:44:54] <jrockjiggz> .eq(0) is the jquery object
[00:44:55] <ravenzz> erdos yes
[00:45:06] <erdos> hmmmm
[00:45:23] <ravenzz> console.dir($(".test"))
[00:45:35] <ravenzz> if you are wondering why
[00:45:51] <erdos> oh what is dir? i usually use console.log
[00:46:22] <ravenzz> ?g mdn console dir @ erdos
[00:46:25] <bot-t> erdos, console.dir - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/console.dir
[00:46:36] <erdos> thanks :)
[00:46:43] <ravenzz> yw
[00:48:17] <erdos> hmmmmm
[00:49:34] <erdos> ahhhh!!
[00:50:20] <erdos> so when you use a class as a selector, then do console.log, the output is different than when you reference by id, but i guess console.dir is what i'm supposed to be using because the results are consistent with that
[00:50:23] <erdos> thanks guys :)
[00:50:46] <karstenk1977_> ravenzz everything is like the doku, but the onSelect Event wonÂ´t work
[00:51:06] <mazzachre> Something I still don't understand, why is "this" in even handlers and each not a jqeury object?!
[00:51:45] <ravenzz> ?demo @ karstenk1977_
[00:51:45] <bot-t> karstenk1977_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[00:53:52] <ravenzz> mazzachre because you might want the current context in plain js, or even better don't need a jQuery object out of "this"
[00:56:13] <ravenzz> eg. this.id vs $(this).attr("id")
[00:59:07] <karstenk1977_> ok, think its only a conflict
[01:01:30] <mazzachre> ravenzz: But how often do you need the context in plain js and how often do you need the jquery object to work on? And you can get the plain object from the jquery object if you need...
[01:04:05] <ravenzz> jquery objects are heavier than dom objects
[01:07:14] <ravenzz> also you can get stuff other than nodes in a loop, eg strings
[01:09:33] <Clex> Let's say I have something like : http://pastie.org/pastes/5451981/text how can I select 1, 2 and 3? I'd like to say something like "select all the divs after the first div which do not contain the class foo".
[01:11:24] <ravenzz> $('div + div:not(".foo")') should work
[01:11:40] <ravenzz> actually you could do that in many different way
[01:11:52] <Clex> ravenzz: won't it select also 5, 6 and 7?
[01:12:07] <ravenzz> oh you want to select only 3 of them?
[01:12:29] <Clex> Yup. :/
[01:12:56] <Clex> I want to get "bar" elements which are in a row.
[01:13:06] <Clex> A row meaning not being separated by "foo".
[01:13:37] <ravenzz> but do you want to select the first 3 with class bar? or the 3 whom its text is "1", "2" and "3"
[01:13:45] <diahane> hello guys, take a look at http://bitfungus.org/Â , if you can help is totally open source! sorry for my bad english :P
[01:14:15] <Clex> The first "row" of elements with the class "bar".
[01:14:21] <ravenzz> ok
[01:18:59] <r500> BinaryKitten: http://graffitisys.com/clients/pc_station/test1/thumbnail_scroller_slideshow_test.html   wanted to get selected thumbail  img src. still not giving expected result
[01:22:51] <r500> BinaryKitten:  sometime gives unselected current image source. can you please go through code ?
[01:23:16] <ravenzz> Clex sorry I had to answer the phone. $("div").not(".foo").filter(":lt(3)")
[01:23:44] <klawd> hi!
[01:23:55] <klawd> can i somehow set callbacks to an array of elements?
[01:24:17] <klawd> lets say i have $foo and $bar which are both jquery wrapped elements. can i somehow go .click(function() {}) on them?
[01:24:24] <klawd> without looping?
[01:24:50] <Clex> Np ravenzz, thanks. :)
[01:26:03] <wachpwnski> How does "this" work in IFFE?
[01:31:22] <erdos> heyyyyy
[01:31:45] <erdos> when you make a jquery object is the prototype of that object always the same?
[01:32:03] <erdos> like is the prototype of $("#tony") the same as $(document) ?
[01:32:49] <Cork> yes
[01:33:03] <erdos> cool! thanks for that clarification!
[01:33:27] <erdos> so i guess for really different objects those methods are just ignored if called in irrelevant situations
[01:34:19] <Cork> erdos: there should rarely be any irrelevant methods on the prototype
[01:34:41] <erdos> i mean like $(window).find or something like that
[01:34:50] <erdos> (which i just checked, returns an empty array)
[01:34:58] <klawd> var $foo = $('#foo'); var $bar = $('#bar'); $.each([$foo, $bar], function(index, $item) { $item.click(); }); <- is there a way to do this without an each?
[01:35:01] <Cork> you're sure?
[01:35:13] <erdos> because logically the window is different from the dom
[01:35:31] <erdos> although i'm yet to read through all these mdn docs, which are very good btw!
[01:35:37] <Cork> hmm
[01:35:51] <ajpiano> klawd: $foo.add( $bar ).click();
[01:35:54] <Cork> erdos: never struck me like something to test :)
[01:36:13] <Cork> erdos: .find just calls the dom query on the window object
[01:36:26] <Cork> and it's up to the browser what will be returned
[01:36:32] <klawd> ajpiano: thanks! does this alter $foo permanently?
[01:36:38] <ajpiano> no
[01:36:42] <klawd> perfect
[01:36:44] <klawd> thank you
[01:36:50] <ajpiano> you have to do $foo = $foo.add( $bar ) if you want that to happen
[01:36:59] <ajpiano> add returns a new collection!
[01:37:02] <ajpiano> welx
[01:37:03] <erdos> i guess i'll have a look at the mdn for an official definition of the window object

[01:37:53] <erdos> thanks, looking now :)
[01:38:05] <Cork> thats mainly what jquery uses for .find in most browsers
[01:40:03] <erdos> oh wow, i thought there was a lot more voodoo than that going on with selectors! (i guess it still has to deal with <=ie7
[01:40:28] <Cork> jquery uses sizzle
[01:40:30] <Cork> ?g sizzle
[01:40:32] <bot-t> Cork, Sizzle JavaScript Selector Library - http://sizzlejs.com/
[01:40:56] <erdos> ah yes i was aware of this, so then sizzle uses this (plus some other voodoo)?
[01:41:36] <erdos> Cork: have you read the jquery source? you seem pretty knowledgable
[01:41:56] <Cork> erdos: i always read a lib before using it
[01:42:14] <Cork> i don't claim to know the code through and through
[01:42:19] <Cork> but i know my way around it
[01:43:28] <erdos> that's very noble! although if i do (rare) end up disecting a library it's usually after i know the library pretty well
[01:43:57] <erdos> i will do this for jquery
[01:44:02] <erdos> after i've read all the manuals
[01:44:12] <Cork> erdos: for big libraries like frameworks i start by checking so its coding standard is sane
[01:44:23] <Cork> if it is, it start using it and read the code as documentation
[01:44:50] <Cork> if the code is written well its often really good documentation
[01:45:16] <erdos> i still don't have a good grasp on design patterns so if i try to do this i get confused... once i get through all my design patterns book i think i'll be able to do this sort of thing a bit better
[01:45:32] <erdos> but at least for jquery there's so many good books out there
[01:46:34] <erdos> ok back to work, cheers for your help :)
[01:52:01] <computer2000> anyone can help me, ive got some problem with character encoding, as soon as special characters are inserted with js they look odd... instead of â†“ i get Ã¢Å“â€¢ ... my html is set to utf-8 by the meta charset tag... anyone can help?
[01:58:17] <karstenk1977_> how can I check with jQuery if an ressource (url) exists?
[01:58:44] <karstenk1977_> I try with jQuery ajax, but I get every time an error
[01:59:58] <karstenk1977_> please can somebody help me to validate with jQuery if this url(http://www.solarcount.net/zaehlerdaten.php?anlage=120752&kennung=s&datum=20121128) exists?
[02:04:09] <kiuma> hello
[02:08:26] <coder7of9> i am using scrollable. when i hold the mouse down i can move right and the pages appear. how to stop this
[02:10:38] <klawd> coder7of9: "the pages appear"??
[02:10:43] <wachpwnski> Any java gurus around?
[02:10:52] <klawd> wachpwnski: no.
[02:10:57] <klawd> #java
[02:10:57] <wachpwnski> js* I have a pretty complex problem
[02:11:06] <klawd> wachpwnski: yes. i can help you
[02:11:14] <klawd> i say so without even knowing what your problem is
[02:11:19] <zulu-gula> while content of my <a> element is animated, when I click on it it does not open new page, but when animation is end link works normal
[02:12:04] <coder7of9> use a span
[02:12:12] <wachpwnski> I have a massif.js file. I am trying to call certain functions. Like Masssif() am I making this correctly? https://gist.github.com/1d060999efd5c3bca333
[02:12:28] <coder7of9> zulu-gula try using a span instead
[02:12:29] <wachpwnski> with a name like klawd confidence must be your strong point. haha
[02:12:58] <zulu-gula> hm
[02:13:33] <codecowboy> Hi. Does anyone know of a way to do remote debugging on the android stock browser i,e not chrome, the default OS browser?
[02:13:40] <klawd> wachpwnski: don't think it does what you think it does
[02:13:42] <klawd> wachpwnski: why.
[02:14:39] <wachpwnski> klawd:  the actuall thing isn't functioning
[02:14:51] <klawd> wachpwnski: you just dumped a boatload of code here.
[02:15:01] <klawd> break it down into a smaller example
[02:15:05] <klawd> and say what's not working
[02:15:24] <wachpwnski> I am trying to call Massif() to init it
[02:15:41] <wachpwnski> if I do Massif() it's not defined
[02:16:05] <wachpwnski> DO i have to hook it in as a jquery plugin?
[02:16:30] <klawd> wachpwnski: do you want it to be kind of class?
[02:16:47] <klawd> or just a container for functions? like a static class?
[02:16:51] <klawd> what's it supposed to be?
[02:16:51] <wachpwnski> Yah, I need to use it site wide
[02:17:13] <wachpwnski> It should be a bunch of static functions
[02:17:47] <klawd> put this in front of line 1: Massif =
[02:17:59] <klawd> would be my quick fix
[02:18:13] <wachpwnski> var or no?
[02:18:19] <klawd> no
[02:18:37] <seutje> should already leak into the global scope
[02:18:55] <klawd> yeah, it should.
[02:19:04] <seutje> why are u returning the Massif object anyway?
[02:19:39] <wachpwnski> confused mostly
[02:19:40] <wachpwnski> lol
[02:20:01] <klawd> wachpwnski: stop with the static nonsense
[02:20:06] <klawd> build yourself a real prototype
[02:21:13] <seutje> yea, looks like u'd want this to be instantiable
[02:22:03] <wachpwnski> klawd:  and tutorials?
[02:22:29] <klawd> wachpwnski: dunno. google?
[02:22:34] <klawd> it's a pretty complex topic
[02:22:38] <klawd> and not easy to master tbh
[02:23:20] <wachpwnski> var myProto = new function() { sort of thing?
[02:23:27] <klawd> yes
[02:23:33] <klawd> but not new function
[02:24:06] <klawd> var myProto = function() { this.foo = 'bar'; }; myProtot.prototype.foo = function() { console.log(this.foo); };
[02:24:09] <klawd> this kinda thing
[02:25:03] <wachpwnski> sweet
[02:25:07] <wachpwnski> That's what I kind of had
[02:25:15] <klawd> kind of, yes.
[02:25:20] <wachpwnski> wait one second
[02:25:32] <wachpwnski> .prototype.foo
[02:25:36] <wachpwnski> is that like convention for private?
[02:25:43] <klawd> no.
[02:25:51] <klawd> wachpwnski: there's no such thing as a class in javascript
[02:25:58] <klawd> there's just objects
[02:26:04] <klawd> and objects have a prototype
[02:26:11] <klawd> you can alter the prototype
[02:26:14] <klawd> you follow?
[02:27:12] <wachpwnski> yah
[02:27:13] <wachpwnski> one second
[02:27:19] <wachpwnski> this is what I had at first
[02:27:38] <wachpwnski> https://gist.github.com/1d060999efd5c3bca333
[02:28:14] <klawd> let me rewrite that, hold on
[02:28:33] <wachpwnski> Thanks :D
[02:29:52] <klawd> https://gist.github.com/e841892cd6fe05aa19d3
[02:33:17] <wachpwnski> :)
[02:33:52] <Renari> Would anyone happen to know why $(inputField).autocomplete("option", "source", tags.availableTags) is throwing an exception saying that I can't use an undefined method autocomplete?
[02:34:16] <Renari> Or rather: cannot call methods on autocomplete prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'option'
[02:35:07] <wachpwnski> are you grabbing an object with $(inputField)?
[02:35:34] <wachpwnski> klawd now how to I init this now?
[02:35:42] <Renari> wachpwnski: yes
[02:35:47] <wachpwnski> just Massif.init() ?
[02:36:15] <Renari> var inputField = tagContainerObject.find(".tagInputField");
[02:36:27] <zps> nyone know gsoc 2013 procedure ?
[02:36:48] <zps> sorry for asking here !
[02:37:27] <mobcat> hi hi
[02:37:32] <zps> hi
[02:37:39] <mobcat> jquery is best query
[02:38:00] <wachpwnski> no sure Renari
[02:38:07] <kerrick> Is there any shorthand for getting an appended element? Google tells me no (or the hack .find(':last')), but the answers are over a year old, and I could've sworn there was a way to do this.
[02:38:34] <kerrick> So if I do $('body').append('div'), I would like to be able to do operations on the div in the same chain
[02:38:39] <mobcat> I believe it's just getting last
[02:38:56] <mobcat> nah
[02:39:04] <xec> kerrick: do $('div').appendTo('body') instead
[02:39:20] <mobcat> will that let him chain it?
[02:39:26] <xec> kerrick: which will return the appended div for chaining
[02:39:35] <mobcat> oh cool
[02:39:47] <kerrick> xec, yeah, I'm aware that will work, but there are multiple nested objects
[02:39:57] <kerrick> oh well, it's fine to have multiple statements I guess :P
[02:40:22] <kerrick> I wanted a slick one-liner (well, a "one-statementer" spread across multiple lines) but w/e
[02:40:30] <xec> lol
[02:40:50] <xec> yeah. doing everything on one line is a bad idea
[02:41:25] <Hooloovoo> one liners is boss
[02:41:36] * Hooloovoo flexes his one liners
[02:42:03] <mobcat> lol
[02:42:15] <mobcat> depends on how complicated your program is
[02:47:57] <mobcat> is jquery mobile as buggy as it seems?
[02:48:06] <mobcat> or are the demos just like that
[02:48:25] <klawd> wachpwnski: what's happening
[02:48:26] <klawd> updates.
[02:52:43] <wachpwnski> I changed the top to
[02:52:54] <wachpwnski> function Massif () {
[02:53:07] <wachpwnski> instead of var Massif = new Function()
[02:53:16] <klawd> that's ok.
[02:53:24] <wachpwnski> then I can instantiate it with m = new Massif
[02:54:06] <wachpwnski> now if I want to call functions by name within this proto can I do window.this['foo']; ?
[02:55:07] <codecowboy> Hi. Does anyone know of a way to do remote debugging on the android stock browser i,e not chrome, the default OS browser?
[02:55:08] <klawd> wat
[02:55:10] <klawd> window.this?!
[02:55:19] <klawd> just instantiate and use it
[02:55:52] <AL13N_work> lol @ window.this
[02:55:53] <zps> f12
[02:56:07] <mobcat> ^
[02:56:33] <zps> \codecowboy
[02:57:06] <wachpwnski> AL13N_work:  *face palm*
[02:57:40] <wachpwnski> If I need to call a function by a string name in the prototype how can I do that?
[02:58:35] <klawd> m = new Massif(); m.prototype['foo'].call(m, args); maybe?
[02:58:37] <klawd> just a guess
[03:01:04] <wachpwnski> I mean within my prototype?
[03:01:14] <klawd> eh
[03:01:17] <klawd> show code.
[03:01:30] <wachpwnski> if I want Massif.prototype.bar to call Massif.prototype.foo by string like window['foo']
[03:02:03] <wachpwnski> https://gist.github.com/1d060999efd5c3bca333
[03:02:05] <klawd> this.prototype['foo'].call(this, args); within Massif.prototype.bar i think
[03:02:11] <wachpwnski> line 45
[03:02:14] <klawd> but it sounds like you're trying to do some evil stuff here
[03:02:37] <wachpwnski> Well lets pump mein breaks then
[03:03:29] <wachpwnski> So I have a bunch of divs in the dom. I want to find their id and execute a function for each of them.
[03:04:20] <klawd> $('div').each(function() { console.log($(this).attr('id'); }
[03:04:24] <klawd> from the top of my head
[03:05:17] <wachpwnski> I know but for each module, I need to execute a function
[03:05:26] <wachpwnski> Like draw this, draw that.
[03:05:49] <klawd> yeah, ok
[03:05:54] <klawd> you need to research more bro.
[03:06:24] <wachpwnski> That TypeError: Cannot read property 'foo' of undefined
[03:06:37] <AL13N_work> let each module do .bind('foo', function (){}) and then trigger (foo)
[03:07:15] <wachpwnski> I don't follow
[03:08:56] <AL13N_work> let whatever module do: $(someparent).live("selector for divs", 'foo', function () {}); then later $("selector").trigger(foo);
[03:09:12] <NodeX> live() is depreciated
[03:09:14] <NodeX> use on()
[03:09:18] <AL13N_work> yes, on()
[03:09:19] <AL13N_work> sorry
[03:09:37] <AL13N_work> i've been using on(), i just mistyped off the top of my head
[03:09:44] <klawd> so.. live is deprecated
[03:09:50] <klawd> what do you use instead then?
[03:09:56] <klawd> on is something different i understand?
[03:09:56] <AL13N_work> on()
[03:09:58] <mobcat> on
[03:10:02] <AL13N_work> no it's not
[03:10:23] <mobcat> $(document).on('click','.yourdiv',function() { ... });
[03:10:39] <mobcat> it works a bit different in the background
[03:10:43] <mobcat> but that's not important
[03:10:52] <mobcat> you can also use .off to turn it off
[03:10:59] <AL13N_work> mobcat: i've used it with the map alot
[03:11:06] <mobcat> and never use $('body').on instead of document because it breaks IE v8
[03:11:28] <klawd> .on is automatically live?
[03:11:34] <AL13N_work> .on({ foo: function () {}, bar: function () {}}, "div.selector");
[03:11:47] <mobcat> coo
[03:12:09] <klawd> i thought .on('click' is snyonymous to .click?
[03:12:22] <AL13N_work> then $("div.selector").trigger('foo'); or $("div.selector").trigger('bar');
[03:12:34] <AL13N_work> klawd: bind('click') is
[03:12:43] <mobcat> you mean $(element).click(function() { .. }); ?
[03:12:58] <klawd> i see
[03:13:06] <mobcat> yea
[03:13:15] <mobcat> what he said
[03:13:17] <klawd> so .bind('click' is the new .click and .on('click' is the new .live('click'?
[03:13:23] <AL13N_work> on is just having your events linked on some parent in case your elements don't exist yet
[03:13:34] <mobcat> click and bind are the same, but live is deprivated
[03:13:39] <mobcat> depricated*
[03:13:41] <AL13N_work> klawd: no, click is a shortcut of .bind('click')
[03:14:04] <klawd> isn't .click discouraged tho?
[03:14:08] <AL13N_work> i donno
[03:14:10] <AL13N_work> is it?
[03:14:14] <klawd> thought so
[03:14:15] <klawd> hold on
[03:14:18] <mobcat> .on will allow you to bind to divs that may not exist like if you ajax something in
[03:14:28] <mobcat> bind and click will fail on that
[03:15:04] <AL13N_work> the trick is that it uses a parent element dat already exists to put them in
[03:15:06] <mobcat> or w/e other event handler you're aiming for
[03:15:08] <klawd> In the first two variations, this method is a shortcut for .bind("click", handler), as well as for .on("click", handler) as of jQuery 1.7.
[03:15:17] <klawd> so .click is both .on and .bind?
[03:16:06] <AL13N_work> well, on without subelements is the same a bind, is it not?
[03:16:09] <mobcat> you could use those two instead of click, but you can't use click instead of those too
[03:16:22] <mobcat> i mean nvm i said that wrong
[03:16:28] <klawd> anyway, lunch.
[03:20:00] <mobcat> are there jquery patterns to designing large jquery scripts?
[03:20:16] <dogmatic69> mobcat: checkout the widget factory
[03:20:48] <mobcat> cool I'll check it out
[03:22:11] <Darsain> is this smooth for you, or do you notice some stuttering? http://jsbin.com/ejevoc/1
[03:22:42] <dogmatic69> not 100% smooth
[03:22:42] <mobcat> there's intermitent stuttering
[03:22:56] <mobcat> most people probably wouldn't tell tho
[03:23:12] <Darsain> exactly. and it is done with requestanimationframe ... if even that won't produce smooth results, what the hell am I supposed to do? :)
[03:23:13] <mobcat> they'd say the clouds look a little unnatural or something feely like that
[03:23:32] <mobcat> redesign our entire computer infrastructure until the clouds scroll right
[03:23:45] <mobcat> build better browser
[03:23:52] <mobcat> lol i dunno
[03:23:55] <Darsain> it is like that in all of them
[03:24:00] <Darsain> least noticeable in firefox
[03:24:07] <Darsain> shit
[03:24:11] <mobcat> what about webgl?
[03:24:19] <mobcat> doesn't that tap video card drivers better
[03:24:36] <Darsain> dunno. goofing around with webgl is still on my todo list :)
[03:25:36] <mobcat> some HTML5 stuff probably do it too
[03:25:45] <mobcat> not some js css tricks like that tho
[03:25:55] <mobcat> it's just quickly incrementing css positions
[03:26:11] <mobcat> too much overhead it'll always lag
[03:28:26] <Darsain> well yeah, but there is no API for animations between CSS and JS...
[03:28:36] <Darsain> which is retarded
[03:29:04] <Darsain> implementing awesome CSS animations, transitions, whatever, without any link to JS...
[03:30:20] <wachpwnski> I got it working. :) yay
[03:30:37] <Darsain> so all I can do is increment the shit out of it, or simulate css animation API with timeouts...
[03:32:17] <wachpwnski> Sounds like a client side problem to me. :)
[03:32:51] <mobcat> I think HTML5 handles animations and stuff
[03:33:00] <wachpwnski> Has a canvas and stuff
[03:33:03] <mobcat> without resorting to hacking your browser
[03:33:08] <mobcat> it'll give you something smooth and non-shitty
[03:33:13] <mobcat> just look into that and canvas
[03:40:49] <ruby_on_tails> .live does not work with keydown ?
[03:41:28] <mobcat> you can make a function of your keydown and attach it to live
[03:41:34] <mobcat> tho you're supposed to use .on now not live
[03:42:40] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: you need to check if the event bubbles, but keydown should work fine as long as theres a focusable element that you're targeting
[03:42:59] <ruby_on_tails> its a newly added div
[03:43:04] <ruby_on_tails> not a textarea or something
[03:43:12] <Cork> normal divs can't have focus
[03:43:21] <Cork> it needs tabstop="0"
[03:43:22] <ruby_on_tails> its a lightbox, once the lighbox opens, it should be keyboard navigable
[03:43:24] <Cork> (attribute)
[03:43:26] <mobcat> what are you trying to do?
[03:44:18] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: but ya you SOULD use one of the delegate syntaxes instead, live does a lot of crazy stuff
[03:44:25] <mobcat> got disconnected
[03:44:28] <mobcat> what were you trying to do?
[03:44:42] <ruby_on_tails> mobcat: (05:13:21  IST) ruby_on_tails: its a lightbox, once the lighbox opens, it should be keyboard navigable
[03:44:56] <ruby_on_tails> currently i have attached he event to the body itself
[03:44:59] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: you need to attribute
[03:45:01] <ruby_on_tails> but it feels bad
[03:45:08] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: tabstop attr ?
[03:45:13] <Cork> uh you need the attribute
[03:45:17] <Cork> tabindex not stop
[03:45:32] <Cork> lol my mistake :)
[03:45:35] <mobcat> when lightbox opens you can set a variable to 'on' and the keydown can only run the function when that variable is set to 'on'
[03:45:39] <Cork> tabindex="0"
[03:46:11] <Cork> or just make sure that the focus is correct
[03:46:11] <ruby_on_tails> mobcat: thats what i have now, but attaching the triggers to body doesnt feel nice to me... or is it a correct thing to do ?
[03:46:20] <Cork> no
[03:46:43] <ruby_on_tails> so i should trigger .focus on the lightbox div once it opens ?
[03:46:49] <ruby_on_tails> and add tabindex 0 ?
[03:46:52] <Cork> yes
[03:46:55] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[03:46:57] <ruby_on_tails> let me check
[03:47:01] <ruby_on_tails> try*
[03:47:07] <mobcat> well if you stick with the previous solution use document not body
[03:48:15] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[03:48:31] <ruby_on_tails> but which one is correct ? conceptually ? both would work, but still....
[03:48:43] <Cork> depends on what you want
[03:49:10] <Cork> if you want to let the user have actions the doesn't correlate to the lightbox, then the focus is corect
[03:49:13] <Cork> *correct
[03:49:33] <Cork> if you don't want the use to ex be able to click outside the lightbox and get out of the navigation
[03:49:39] <Cork> then you want the other solution
[03:50:07] <Cork> though you can solve that with a cover screen if you prefer that
[03:50:18] <Cork> (thats what jquery modal dialogs does)
[03:50:19] <ruby_on_tails> oh, well, i meant keyup
[03:50:21] <ruby_on_tails> not keydown
[03:50:27] <ruby_on_tails> yea i got coverscreen
[03:50:48] <Cork> if you put the even handling on that instead of the dialog it fitts better
[03:51:12] <ruby_on_tails> but it just doesnt work :(
[03:51:18] <ruby_on_tails> $(".lb_canvas").live("keyup", function(e)
[03:51:21] <ruby_on_tails> doesnt trigger
[03:51:27] <ruby_on_tails> aah ok
[03:51:28] <ruby_on_tails> .on
[03:51:28] <b-ot> ruby_on_tails, used for many things that shouldn't be memorized
[03:51:33] <Cork> would have to see a working example
[03:51:40] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: ya .on or .delegate
[03:51:41] <ruby_on_tails> k
[03:51:45] <ruby_on_tails> uploading
[03:51:55] <Cork> though on has another syntax then live
[03:52:04] <Cork> its closer to delegate (much closer)
[03:56:15] <rikurouvila> is there a way to handle iframe load errors? im using .ready() now to handle the load event but I need a way to check that it's not giving any error responses
[03:56:33] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: http://thecodeplayer.com/lightbox1.html
[03:56:54] <ruby_on_tails> $(".lb_canvas").on("keyup", function(e)  doesnt work
[03:57:03] <Cork> though on has another syntax then live <--
[03:57:15] <Cork> rikurouvila: it might trigger an error event
[03:57:17] <Cork> not sure
[03:57:30] <Cork> ?.delegate @ ruby_on_tails
[03:57:31] <bot-t> ruby_on_tails, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[03:57:35] <rikurouvila> well I tried to use the .error() also
[03:57:39] <rikurouvila> but it's not using it
[03:57:52] <Cork> .on('errors, function() {})
[03:57:55] <Cork> opps
[03:57:58] <Cork> .on('error', function() {})
[03:58:01] <ruby_on_tails> $("#dataTable tbody tr").on("click", function(event){ picked this from http://api.jquery.com/on/
[03:58:16] <wachpwnski> how can you tell if it's a dataType missmatch on an ajax request?
[03:58:35] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: $(".lb_canvas").on("keyup", function(e) {}) converts to:
[03:58:43] <rikurouvila> Cork: ill try that one, sec
[03:59:04] <Cork> $(document).on("keyup", ".lb_canvas", function(e) {}) or $(document).delegate(".lb_canvas", "keyup", function(e) {})
[03:59:33] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: hmm
[03:59:43] <Cork> wachpwnski: .fail is triggered
[04:00:14] <rikurouvila> meh, its not working
[04:00:54] <Cork> rikurouvila: it was just a guess, i work it was a long time since i worked with iframes so i don't remember what events it triggers
[04:00:58] <Cork> ?mdn iframe
[04:00:59] <bot-t> Cork, (The usage of second argument of jQuery( html [ , ownerDocument ] )) - Opened 2 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11420
[04:01:05] <Cork> O_o
[04:01:14] <Darsain> I'd personaly want to strangle anyone using that lightbox linked above
[04:01:17] <Cork> ah right
[04:01:21] <Cork> ?mdc iframe
[04:01:24] <bot-t> Cork, iframe - HTML | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - The HTML inline frame element ( <iframe> ) represents a nested browsing context, effectively embedding another HTML page into the current page. Each browsing context has its own session history and... https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/iframe
[04:01:24] <rikurouvila> yeah, i'm just using it to post sum files to it
[04:02:45] <Darsain> when I click next, I want to see next image. I dont want to wait half a second till it animates width, than another half to animate height, and than fade in ... THE FUCK! any transition longer than 100ms is not acceptable!
[04:03:29] <seutje> ANGER!
[04:03:58] <Cork> rikurouvila: dug around a bit; and iframe doesn't trigger any failed information event
[04:04:02] <Darsain> YES. it is nice the first time, but if you just want to see the images, and not jerk off on what you can do with animation, it just pisses you off
[04:04:29] <seutje> so u disable them
[04:04:35] <rikurouvila> Cork: alright, well i'm probably going to just trigger functions in the iframe from the parent window then
[04:05:01] <Cork> rikurouvila: why don't you just send the data over ajax?
[04:05:13] <rikurouvila> ajax can't handle fileuploads?
[04:05:29] <Cork> hmm, depends on the browser but ya
[04:05:40] <Cork> ie can't so...
[04:05:43] <Darsain> rikurouvila: crossbrowser method is to do it via iframe
[04:05:50] <rikurouvila> ^^
[04:05:53] <rikurouvila> yep I know
[04:05:57] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: still does not work
[04:05:57] <rikurouvila> and that's what im trying to do
[04:05:59] <ruby_on_tails> $(document).on("keyup", ".lb_canvas", function(e)
[04:06:01] <Cork> well iframe, flash or any other plugin
[04:06:36] <rikurouvila> actually i'm going to just output some JSON in the iframe page
[04:06:49] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: http://localhost/thecodeplayer/garage/lightbox1 can check here
[04:08:00] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: ya, i already have the "real" url :(
[04:08:02] <Cork> *:)
[04:08:12] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: sorry for that lol
[04:08:29] <Cork> one min let me through together a testcase
[04:09:06] <ruby_on_tails> k
[04:15:05] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: ya, key events doesn't bubble
[04:15:15] <ruby_on_tails> sigh :(
[04:15:17] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/89fXL/5/ (1 - 5)
[04:15:24] <ruby_on_tails> i guess i will go with the other solution then
[04:15:50] <Cork> you could bind the event listener when you create the element; but ya
[04:17:00] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: why does direct show
[04:17:05] <ruby_on_tails> but bubble doesnt
[04:17:34] <Cork> cause i bound it directoy on the div
[04:17:43] <Cork> its not a delegated event
[04:18:21] <ruby_on_tails> but you used .on
[04:18:24] <ruby_on_tails> whats the differece ?
[04:18:28] <ruby_on_tails> i am confused :(
[04:18:39] <Cork> on is a collection of all the ways you can bind events in jquery
[04:19:11] <Cork> .on('event', function) => .bind(function) => shorthands like .click(function)
[04:19:19] <ruby_on_tails> you used .on in both cases, should have worked ?
[04:19:51] <Cork> on('event', 'selector', function) => .delegate('selector', 'event' function) => $('selector').live('event', function)
[04:20:10] <Cork> check the atributes
[04:20:10] <ruby_on_tails> live is so good
[04:20:15] <Cork> its not
[04:20:15] <ruby_on_tails> i will use that only lol
[04:20:24] <Cork> its horrible
[04:20:27] <ruby_on_tails> why ?
[04:21:00] <Cork> $('selector').live('event', function) => 1. jquery search and selects all the elements that matches the selector
[04:21:19] <Cork> 2. uses the string given to live and throws the array of the matched elements away
[04:21:55] <Cork> 3. then binds an event listener to $(document) with the event type given to live and checks if the selector matches in the bubbled event
[04:22:53] <Cork> .delegate or .on (delegated) => 1. binds an event listener to the selected element, and listens for a matching bubbling event
[04:23:27] <Cork> so you do a full dom traversal and array collection thats utterly unneeded if you use .live
[04:24:23] <Cork> and depending on what selector you use, that can be quite a lot of work for the browser
[04:24:39] <mobcat> especially if that browser is IE
[04:24:44] <Cork> yes
[04:25:18] <mobcat> don't bind to 'body' with IE either it freezes browser
[04:25:22] <mobcat> with .on
[04:25:32] <mobcat> do document if you wanna do that
[04:25:54] <VastGsmX> hey all
[04:26:11] <VastGsmX> Anyone here know how to get a contact form working?
[04:28:05] <Cork> VastGsmX: that question is way to vague and generic
[04:28:14] <Cork> its like asking how ling is a string
[04:28:20] <VastGsmX> lol
[04:28:26] <VastGsmX> ok ill pastebin it
[04:28:33] <mobcat> good idea
[04:28:33] <VastGsmX> coz its tooo long dude
[04:28:49] <VastGsmX> http://pastebin.com/XAvMHaqh
[04:28:52] <mobcat> a contact form is very basic stuff though, you should just grab a php book maybe
[04:28:54] <VastGsmX> there we go :)
[04:28:56] <Cork> the slim it down to that it can match you question
[04:29:26] <Cork> VastGsmX: do you want to make it use ajax, or what?
[04:29:38] <mobcat> i think he wants you to debug his script for him lul
[04:29:44] <Cork> you have almost no information what so ever about what you want to do
[04:29:50] <Cork> uh...
[04:29:52] <Cork> no
[04:29:53] <mobcat> get to work!
[04:30:00] <VastGsmX> yeah dude
[04:30:05] <VastGsmX> it aint working
[04:30:22] <Cork> so start reducing the variables
[04:30:23] <VastGsmX> I tried a whole heap of different things but no joy
[04:30:39] <Cork> 1. take php out of the equation, render it to a static html file and try with that
[04:30:42] <mobcat> start with a form with 1 field that is a text field, then click submit to a php page where you collect the info in a variable
[04:30:43] <Cork> and so on
[04:30:50] <mobcat> and then build from there
[04:31:15] <mobcat> lol w/e you want vast the world is your oyster
[04:31:23] <VastGsmX> ok, ill give it a go but I'm new to webdesign to be honest
[04:31:32] <mobcat> you really should grab a php book or something
[04:31:37] <mobcat> cus this stuff is covered almost immediately
[04:31:37] <VastGsmX> thanks for the advice though
[04:31:43] <VastGsmX> yeah you got any in mind?
[04:31:46] <mobcat> YEA
[04:31:48] <mobcat> yea*
[04:32:03] <mobcat> http://www.amazon.com/PHP-MySQL-Web-Development-Edition/dp/0672329166/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1354192315&sr=8-2&keywords=php+mysql
[04:32:09] <Cork> VastGsmX: when you can get it down to a more specific question you'll have much grater chance of getting help
[04:32:19] <mobcat> that'll cover what you need
[04:32:39] <mobcat> but
[04:32:42] <mobcat> if you're impatient you can do this
[04:32:42] <mobcat> http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_forms.asp
[04:32:47] <mobcat> that'll do basic php forms
[04:32:48] <Cork> OUCH
[04:32:53] * Cork hits mobcat 
[04:32:59] <mobcat> I w3c'd this
[04:32:59] <Cork> don't swear
[04:33:05] <wachpwnski> silly question
[04:33:29] <Cork> mobcat: w3cschools is a site you should NEVER point new developers too
[04:33:39] <mobcat> protip: he's not a developer
[04:33:44] <Cork> you'll just give them headache down the road
[04:33:57] <mobcat> there's a hedaache down every road for a programmer
[04:34:10] <Cork> mobcat: ok, so don't point anyone there that doesn't know what to ignore on that page
[04:34:16] <mobcat> if you don't wanna hedache attend CS major at uni, otherwize i don't see the problem with some crap documentation for begineers
[04:34:35] <Cork> mobcat: that page is littered with errors and ie centric answers
[04:34:46] <Cork> its plainly a bad source of information
[04:34:58] <mobcat> that's why I offered the book first
[04:35:03] <VastGsmX> thanks mobcat
[04:35:09] <mobcat> if you REALLY wanna learn what's up
[04:35:09] <VastGsmX> ill take a look
[04:35:10] <Cork> uh... there are online sources that are good
[04:35:13] <Cork> you can use them
[04:35:22] <Cork> like mdn or operas tutorials
[04:35:24] <Cork> and more
[04:35:36] <VastGsmX> Cork: how do you mean, I did round it up
[04:35:37] <Cork> ?g opera web tutorial
[04:35:39] <bot-t> Cork, 1: Introduction to The Web Standards Curriculum/Table of ... - Opera - http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/1-introduction-to-the-web-standards-cur/
[04:35:45] <VastGsmX> Contact form not working, lol
[04:35:47] <Cork> ?g mdn
[04:35:47] <bot-t> Cork, Mozilla Developer Network - https://developer.mozilla.org/
[04:35:52] <VastGsmX> But in all honesty I'm new
[04:35:57] <VastGsmX> Thing is I dont get is this
[04:36:05] <VastGsmX> Its included in a template
[04:36:07] <Cork> VastGsmX: first. don't have php in your pb unless you ask php questions
[04:36:21] <Cork> 2. dig a bit into what happens and give an error code or something to start at
[04:36:42] <VastGsmX> The template content edited and then should just be a quick edit in the contact form but ohhhhh noooo, if only it was aye
[04:36:48] <Cork> else its just a big blob and the other party has to start with trying to reproduce your problem
[04:37:00] <mobcat> don't handle big scripts if you don't understand them, just start from step 1
[04:37:07] <Cork> ya
[04:37:17] <Cork> don't touch code you don't understand
[04:37:17] <mobcat> step 1 learn basics of html and php
[04:37:18] <VastGsmX> yeah buts thats easy to reproduce dude
[04:37:27] <VastGsmX> download temp 2 or 3mb
[04:37:29] <VastGsmX> unzip
[04:37:44] <mobcat> we could sit here and fix your code but guess what it'll break again in 2 seconds when you try to add something or realize it isn't secure or w/e etc etc
[04:37:46] <VastGsmX> run upload to a dire on ftp
[04:37:59] <VastGsmX> open contacts page
[04:38:04] <VastGsmX> fill out form
[04:38:06] <VastGsmX> click send
[04:38:09] <VastGsmX> not work
[04:38:17] <mobcat> cork kill me now
[04:38:21] <Cork> lol
[04:38:21] <VastGsmX> investigate
[04:38:35] <VastGsmX> sorry to be frank :(
[04:38:45] <VastGsmX> thats the logic way I see it
[04:38:49] <Cork> VastGsmX: if you want help you have to get to a starting point so ppl see its worth the time
[04:39:02] <VastGsmX> ok, fairplay
[04:39:11] <VastGsmX> what do you advise me to do then please Cork?
[04:39:12] <Cork> what you presented a minute ago is just a dump and it means a lot of work just to see what happens
[04:39:13] <mobcat> once you get up to speed you'll have lots of real questions and places you're stuck
[04:39:15] <mobcat> that's when to come here
[04:39:20] <mobcat> =P
[04:39:22] <Cork> VastGsmX: already gave you the tips
[04:39:32] * VastGsmX scrolls up to look
[04:39:33] <Cork> VastGsmX: 1. render the php and post raw html
[04:39:43] <mobcat> you shouldn't be using jquery until you understand php and html I think
[04:39:51] <mobcat> then do css / jquery and js and crap
[04:39:54] <Cork> 2. if you don't get the raw html to do the job, then you need to feed it through a validator
[04:40:03] <rikurouvila> is it somehow possible to clear previously set event functions? if I have like $('#sumdiv').on('something', function() { ... })
[04:40:17] <rikurouvila> and I need to set it multiple times
[04:40:18] <Cork> rikurouvila: yes and no
[04:40:23] <VastGsmX> I see
[04:40:31] <mobcat> you can use .off
[04:40:42] <Cork> rikurouvila: you can clear all event listneres of that type with .off
[04:40:46] <mobcat> to unset what you set on #sumdiv
[04:40:51] <Cork> rikurouvila: or you need to use a namespace
[04:41:13] <rikurouvila>  cool thanks
[04:41:16] <Cork> $('#sumdiv').on('something.my-events'); $('#sumdiv').off('something.my-events')
[04:41:29] <Cork> or simply $('#sumdiv').off('.my-events')
[04:41:39] <rikurouvila> alright
[04:41:43] <mobcat> vast just saw an example of a real question
[04:41:45] <rikurouvila> I think that's going to do the trick
[04:42:36] <rikurouvila> it worked! thanks Cork and mobcat
[04:44:41] <mobcat> coo
[04:47:06] <mobcat> so how reliable is jquery mobile?
[04:47:12] <mobcat> anybody happy with it?
[04:47:31] <Cork> si and so; i don't use it
[04:47:41] <mobcat> neither do i
[04:48:05] <Cork> it has a few hacks that i don't fully agree with
[04:48:05] <mobcat> just played with the demos and they seemed a bit buggy
[04:48:14] <Cork> and its flow isn't to my taste
[04:48:19] <mobcat> same here
[04:49:06] <Cork> but at least it smoothens the pavement a bit when you develop for mobiles
[04:49:17] <mobcat> I prefer hard landings
[04:49:18] <Cork> cause those buggy browser can really drive you mad...
[04:49:42] <mobcat> I've found fixes more most of the problems I have
[04:49:59] <VastGsmX> [12:41] <mobcat> vast just saw an example of a real question - lol cheeky ha ha
[04:50:04] <mobcat> lol
[04:50:09] <mobcat> i'm a cheeky bastard
[04:50:11] <Cork> sure, but ex. problems with fixed elements and scrollings is crazy
[04:50:23] <mobcat> yea that's what I fixed
[04:50:24] <iSeeDeadPixels> vladikoff: pong
[04:50:26] <VastGsmX> Dude I'm new to webdesign mate
[04:50:27] <mobcat> no scrolling problems anymore
[04:50:46] <Cork> mobcat: fixing that is far from easy
[04:50:47] <mobcat> scroll smoothly on iphone and android
[04:50:52] <mobcat> on overflow divs
[04:50:57] <Cork> cause there isn't really any full fixes
[04:51:02] <VastGsmX> basically me ole man is doing a degree at uni and he needs a website designed, I fix pc's and servers, it support now web dev
[04:51:04] <Cork> only workaround ontop of workarounds
[04:51:09] <mobcat> works 100% for me on multiple devices no bugs
[04:51:14] <mobcat> they aren't pretty fixes I guess you could say
[04:51:14] <VastGsmX> so I'm new to that side of things dude
[04:51:21] <mobcat> the browser should be handling it
[04:51:32] <SmallCode> VastGsmX you sound like a web dev pro!
[04:51:41] <mobcat> he hacked the gibson
[04:51:42] <SmallCode> No Mobcat, I think you mean the css
[04:51:42] <Cork> mobcat: the problem is you can't fix it in js, cause you don't get enough information from the browser to do it
[04:51:45] <VastGsmX> I edited the temp and just trying to get the contact form working dude
[04:51:52] <Cork> mobcat: there will always be fallouts from it
[04:51:54] <VastGsmX> thats all really m8
[04:51:57] <VastGsmX> lol
[04:52:26] <Cork> mobcat: just have a look at jquery-mobiles tracker from there toolbars; or the bug tracker for iScroll.js
[04:52:32] <mobcat> are you talking about scrolling inside an overflow'd div?
[04:52:52] <Cork> mobcat: about having things fixed while other parts can scroll
[04:53:01] <SmallCode> Im talking about
[04:53:06] <SmallCode> overflow: hidden-y;
[04:53:14] <Cork> and while software keyboards doesn't break it in all the different devices
[04:53:23] <SmallCode> And then its deffered to the 5th parallel of Javascript
[04:53:28] <SmallCode> then back routed through the sub domain
[04:53:44] <SmallCode> Causing a sub proxy to trigger
[04:53:55] <SmallCode> Thus triggering the callback resulting in -1
[04:54:17] <mobcat> I have a site with fixed elements and scrollable elements working just fine in iphone
[04:54:47] <Cork> and android 3.2, android 2.3, kindle?
[04:55:01] <mobcat> I havn't test it on old android
[04:55:03] <Cork> they all have different bugs and hack for one breaks it in another
[04:55:04] <VastGsmX> SmallCode like I said I'm new to this ball game, all I am trying to achieve is get a contact form working
[04:55:08] <VastGsmX> The code is there
[04:55:13] <VastGsmX> the html is there
[04:55:17] <VastGsmX> the js is there
[04:55:19] <VastGsmX> its linked
[04:55:26] <mobcat> it's insane to support all of android's versions
[04:55:26] <VastGsmX> just needs tweaking
[04:55:34] <VastGsmX> so nope not a webdev LoooooooL
[04:55:37] <mobcat> i'd love to see if it works tho
[04:55:37] <SmallCode> Yep, and your going to need a sub-proxy filter, because the dynamic content is loaded from a java third-party call back handler
[04:55:47] <Cork> mobcat: ya, its when you go outside developing for one single mobile unit that you start to see the problem
[04:56:03] <aqeel> hi room
[04:56:10] <mobcat> outside of latest android and iphone, they can fend for themselves =P
[04:56:33] <SmallCode> Exactly mobcat, iPhone handles the trigger back with more room for error
[04:56:42] <SmallCode> Thats why you cant call iframes from iphones
[04:57:37] <midori-rus> http://jsfiddle.net/symbios_zi/BnbFd/ why this alert returns 6 elements?
[04:58:13] <Cork> ?eval "test-1".length
[04:58:16] <bot-t> Cork: 6
[04:58:19] <Cork> :)
[04:58:43] <NodeX> midori-rus things are zero based
[04:58:44] <Cork> midori-rus: its not 6 element, its a string with 6 characters
[04:58:46] <mobcat> lol
[04:58:50] <AntonKor> man i felt like i knew that one and was about to answer :D
[04:58:58] <NodeX> are also *
[04:59:41] <midori-rus> how to count array?
[04:59:47] <VastGsmX> ok Cork
[04:59:47] <Cork> you don't have one
[04:59:56] <Cork> midori-rus: so what is it you're tying to do?
[05:00:04] <VastGsmX> here is another link for you as you said I being vague with the Q
[05:00:23] <Cork> midori-rus: right now you search for .mappaper, picks the first one, grabs its id attribute, and stores that in oAr
[05:00:40] <Cork> then you check the length of that string
[05:01:01] <VastGsmX> Cork: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13610788/contact-form-from-template-monster-diving-club-html5-css3-jquery-help-not-workin
[05:01:02] <midori-rus> Cork i want make new array as ["first_id", "second_id"...]
[05:01:27] <mobcat> well this makes it official cork now you have to answer
[05:01:39] <Cork> midori-rus: var oAr = $.map($(".mappaper"), function(elm) { return elm.id; });
[05:01:53] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/BnbFd/1/
[05:02:31] <mobcat> that's a cool function I havn't used that one yet
[05:04:01] <mobcat> http://pastebin.com/2Td9quwd
[05:04:08] <mobcat> this is what i use for scrolling inside overflow'd divs
[05:04:25] <mobcat> I just attach touchScroll() to the div if its a mobile device
[05:04:41] <mobcat> seems to work, and iphone no longer needs 2 fingers to scroll
[05:07:09] <nb-ben>  what would I do to get the entire page HTML ?
[05:07:17] <nb-ben> like, $('html').html() ?
[05:07:43] <Cork> you won't ever get the entire pages html
[05:07:50] <Cork> you can only get whats inside body
[05:08:05] <aqeel> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6266559/jQuery.plugins/Versions/jquery.aautoscroll.2.41.js
[05:08:44] <aqeel> guys can some one help me remove the dependency for timers jquery, as stated all other are removed but from delay function only
[05:08:57] <aqeel> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6266559/jQuery.plugins/Default.htm
[05:09:45] <aqeel> basicaly it stops the scrolla nd then starts after some time
[05:10:40] <aqeel> i guess what he had done with pause and resume can be implimented to remove the dependency
[05:11:04] <nicEdit> hi
[05:11:27] <aqeel> so any one wanna help me with this plugin
[05:12:25] <nicEdit> http://nicedit.com/demos.php
[05:13:54] <nicEdit> can someone tell me how to make the combo box to show the selected values?
[05:14:39] <bittyx-work> hi all, i need a bit of advice with the jquery ui datepicker. specifically, i want to know how to retrieve the default dateFormat used by the datepicker? i have a multilingual app, and on DOM load, i call $.datepicker.setDefaults( ... ) based on the <html> lang attribute.
[05:14:58] <Cork> nicEdit: sounds like you should ask the developers of that site instead
[05:15:00] <bittyx-work> in other parts of my code, i need to know which dateFormat is *currently* set as the default for the datepicker plugin
[05:15:19] <Cork> aqeel: you have quite small chance of getting anyone to help develop you're code for you
[05:15:38] <bittyx-work> i know i can get the dateFormat used by a specific instance with $( "#datepicker" ).datepicker( "option", "dateFormat" ); but i need to know it without actually creating a datepicker
[05:15:38] <aqeel> no it is not mine
[05:15:54] <Cork> aqeel: but you need the code change
[05:16:03] <Cork> so by that its "you're code"
[05:16:13] <bittyx-work> any ideas?
[05:16:14] <aqeel> https://sites.google.com/site/danielgidmanresume/history/jquery-aautoscroll
[05:16:24] <Saaether> you are code?
[05:16:32] <Cork> lolsoryr
[05:16:37] <Cork> *sorry
[05:17:43] <aqeel> why not...may be i can then email him the edited code
[05:18:00] <aqeel> so no dependency and a helping hand
[05:18:10] <aqeel> i do not take credit for this
[05:18:26] <Cork> aqeel: if you want someone to do you're coding you will have to look for hired help
[05:23:21] <SmallCode> Uh oh he went admin mode
[05:23:21] <aqeel> hey can i just use delay() fopr that function
[05:23:56] <SmallCode> hes googling how to use irc admin guys
[05:24:08] <SmallCode> Im sorry XGC
[05:24:22] <SmallCode> I just wanted to know how to edit the DB so that I can use full text searching
[05:25:15] <bittyx-work> just found the answer to my question by browsing the datepicker source... there is a single way to do what i want reliably but it's very ugly - basically, you have to access $.datepicker._defaults['dateFormat'], but it would be nicer if datepicker had a .getDefaults() method, as a counterpart to .setDefaults()
[05:26:14] <aqeel> $(this).autoscroll("pause").delay(500).autoscroll("resume");
[05:28:53] <AntonKor> does anyone know if theres a osx app to do mobile device testing easier?
[05:29:22] <AntonKor> as in real devices, not virtual ones
[05:29:49] <aqeel> adobe device central....
[05:29:50] <Cork> you mean a web serivce?
[05:29:51] <nicEdit> Cork: i did sent a mail to the developer, did not receive any reply till now.  the forum also has been closed.  after a thorough check, i found, line, 1137 when i write alert(elm) and change the value of combobox, the alert is getting triggered, and it is showing the selected value.  Now the only thing left is i want to pass that value to the combo box
[05:30:23] <AntonKor> nty device central,  na as in a nexus 7 or iphone that is in your hand
[05:30:23] <nicEdit> http://pastebin.com/5jXaPNAV
[05:30:26] <Cork> nicEdit: in that case i would prob pick another editor
[05:30:43] <Cork> nicEdit: like ex. ckEditor
[05:31:26] <AntonKor> i know you can access localhost from your device, its just a bother to setup :/
[05:34:55] <SmallCode> So i got banned from mysql channel
[05:35:04] <SmallCode> so guess where all my mysql questions will now be going?
[05:35:05] <SmallCode> jquery
[05:35:06] <SmallCode> thats right
[05:36:13] <mobcat> lol
[05:36:17] <mobcat> how did you get banned from mysql
[05:37:53] <CJKay> Hey guys, does anyone have any ideas as to why the text moves down, slides, then moves back up again in Firefox on this page? http://chris-kay.co.uk/
[05:38:00] <CJKay> (Hover over it)
[05:38:09] <CJKay> It works fine in Chrome :(
[05:38:57] <SmallCode> Cuz i fucking trolled the shit out of the admin in there
[05:39:32] <mobcat> lol

[05:52:30] <aqeel> SmallCode: ...as if SMALL
[05:53:00] <SmallCode> aqeel how u doing boss?
[05:53:33] <aqeel> FINE THANKS, AND YOUR QUESTION IS?
[05:53:42] <aqeel> sorry my bad for caps
[05:53:43] <SmallCode> Do u answering SQL questions
[05:53:44] <SmallCode> ?
[05:53:53] <aqeel> can give a try
[05:53:57] <aqeel> ask it though
[05:54:04] <SmallCode> IF X is = 9
[05:54:09] <SmallCode> and J is equal to 5
[05:54:13] <mobcat> he's just mad trolling
[05:54:18] <SmallCode> SELECT * FROM J where X = > 1000
[05:54:22] <SmallCode> Would that evaluate to true
[05:54:25] <mobcat> trying to rustle #jquery jimmies
[05:54:30] <SmallCode> or would i pass a sub query to it?
[05:56:46] <aqeel> select *, what exactly are you selecting?
[05:56:57] <aqeel> the whole?
[05:58:00] <dns-away> !jquery - show my ass
[05:58:47] <dns-away> jquery needs to be have happy functions );
[05:58:49] <dns-away> :)
[06:03:55] <AntonKor> how would one go about calling a function after everything gets done in .each()
[06:04:17] <klawd> everytime .each finishes?
[06:04:40] <AntonKor> just once
[06:04:48] <klawd> call the function after the each?!
[06:05:32] <AntonKor> er, been a long day, wording is off
[06:06:13] <mobcat> ?_?
[06:06:14] <bot-t> mobcat, #9746 (domManip incorrectly adds "?_=NNNN" to passed <script>s ... - Opened 7 days ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9746
[06:07:20] <aqeel> or wrap your each in one()
[06:09:14] <aqeel> on() and for once use one()
[06:12:32] <Saaether> AntonKor http://jsfiddle.net/v5Px9/ heres an example for you
[06:13:42] <AntonKor> wow, .promise() is a function
[06:13:55] <AntonKor> cool, thanks
[06:14:00] <Saaether> np
[06:14:27] <AntonKor> that blew my mind
[06:14:40] <AntonKor> prolly coolest thing i learned in a while about jquery
[06:16:16] <aqeel> AntonKor: http://jqapi.ru/
[06:16:21] <AntonKor> is it heavy to use many of those?
[06:16:39] <AntonKor> not that i am right now, im just curious how heavy they are
[06:16:55] <AntonKor> thanks aqeel
[06:17:17] <AntonKor> i havnt looked at cheatsheets since jquery 1.2
[06:17:18] <Saaether> i actually havent used promise alot in live work so im not sure
[06:17:34] <aqeel> you are welcome
[06:18:13] <AntonKor> isee
[06:19:46] <shoky_> don't really see what that .promise() is for in the fiddle..
[06:20:08] <Saaether> it runs the function after the each is complete
[06:20:13] <shoky_> .promise() only promises to wait until animations/stuff on fx queue is done
[06:20:31] <shoky_> $('.junk').each(...);  $('body').append('done');
[06:20:47] <shoky_> the .promise() would only be helpful if there were animations on $('.junk')
[06:20:50] <AntonKor> well it worked in my case. without it my next "thing" fired at same time as .each() was firing
[06:21:11] <AntonKor> yeah, animations where involved
[06:21:13] <AntonKor> :D
[06:21:13] <shoky_> then your previous "thing" was animatisons?
[06:21:15] <shoky_> ya.
[06:21:42] <AntonKor> well they where css animations trigged by adClass()
[06:21:44] <shoky_> if the animations were on a different element for example, that wouldn't help at all
[06:21:52] <shoky_> huh
[06:21:59] <shoky_> .promise() doesn't wait for css animations
[06:22:05] <Logi> I'm having an annoying problem. On https://www-test.sarweather.com/forecast/result/20121128-165958-6962d61b6155/static/composite/152 I have an animate button for my weather forecasts, but when the animation is running and loading images, then mouse events on the button to stop the animation tend to be lost, so user's can't stop the animation again. Any ideas, or do I need to sverely limit the frame-rate?
[06:22:11] <Logi> (and yes, that cert is expired. It's our test server and only started up when we're nearing release)
[06:22:21] <Logi> ((and yes, I just asked in #javascript but realised that here might be better))
[06:22:50] <wolfehr> hey guys, does $('#foo.bar').focuson(function(){} get triggered if I remove .bar from #foo?
[06:23:18] <jrockjiggz> wolfehr: what?
[06:23:20] <shoky_> wolfehr: yes, the selector is only used one time
[06:23:25] <shoky_> when binding the handler
[06:23:32] <wolfehr> that's what i thought, cheers
[06:30:42] <rikurouvila> can I somehow convert the string that stringify() outputs to object and back to string?
[06:30:53] <rikurouvila> need to remove some values
[06:37:16] <CaptainAmerica> afternoon people, if some one can help me solve this issue I will have your babies!!!
[06:37:24] <Frosty> lol
[06:38:16] <CaptainAmerica> http://pastie.org/5453170  - I am getting an error in IE7  the error is SCRIPT3: Member not found
[06:38:26] <shoky_> rikurouvila: JSON.parse
[06:38:34] <CaptainAmerica> there is a reference to jquery.min.js, line 2 character 32122
[06:39:02] <Eviltwin> ?line1
[06:39:03] <bot-t> "Is anyone familiar with the error 'c.x is undefined' on line 1 of the jQuery file?" No. Somewhere along the line, you are probably passing something incorrect to jQuery. Use the unminified source to debug and provide a stack trace, not just an error message. See where in your code the problem is. Learn how here: http://is.gd/ftKTQP
[06:39:38] <rikurouvila> shoky_ yeah, sry, I meant .serialize()
[06:40:05] <shoky> ?serializeArray @ rikurouvila
[06:40:06] <bot-t> rikurouvila, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[06:40:27] <rikurouvila> thanks!
[06:42:45] <Frosty> Hey guys I just joined the chat to ask something quick.... I'm new to jQuery so it might seem dumb to most of you :P
[06:43:03] <rikurouvila> shoky: can I somehow convert the array back to string afterwards?
[06:43:05] <aqeel> nope and never will..
[06:43:06] <Frosty> I want to create a "form maker" using jQuery that increments a function with the simple click of a button.... Something like "Add a new question" button, that always stays at the bottom of the previous inserted question.
[06:43:19] <aqeel> you never knew when you learned something new
[06:44:01] <Frosty> I'm still searching the web about it, but I thought I'd ask here too....
[06:44:16] <shoky> rikurouvila: do you want to use it in an ajax post as data?
[06:44:35] <rikurouvila> yeah
[06:45:11] <aqeel> hey frosty do have iniat question or blank at first then gets amended
[06:46:02] <cisforcojo> hi guys, how can i change the offset parent for a draggable? i'm moving the div from one 'relative' parent to another and need the new relative position to come from the new parent. if i insert it in to the parent, then i lose my positioning from the drag
[06:46:02] <Frosty> Sorry, I didn't get you... :P What do you mean?
[06:46:07] <shoky> rikurouvila: you can just pass that array as the data
[06:46:41] <rikurouvila> oh
[06:46:43] <rikurouvila> cool
[06:46:47] <rikurouvila> well thanks shoky :)
[06:46:50] <rikurouvila> ill try that one
[06:46:57] <shoky> np
[06:47:20] <Frosty> <aqeel>...?
[06:48:33] <aqeel> 1. you have a question displayed and you want to add underneath it, 2. you have nothing and as you click the button  uestion gets added
[06:48:46] <aqeel> question*
[06:49:02] <Frosty> Well... I suppose the 2nd
[06:49:30] <Frosty> Both actually
[06:49:41] <aqeel> lol
[06:50:21] <aqeel> now you want to have both implemented in one together or in 2 seperate functions?
[06:50:53] <Frosty> Let me give you an idea of the page...
[06:51:40] <Frosty> 1. No question - I fill in the form and the press the button to add it to the page.
[06:52:42] <Frosty> 2. A previous question was added - I fill in the newly spawned form to fill in the 2nd question and press "add" button to add it to the page.
[06:53:30] <Frosty> Obs. the new form is the function that gets incremented every-time I press the "add" button
[06:53:48] <mirceas17> hello jquery people
[06:53:56] <aqeel> well its second
[06:54:07] <aqeel> do you have your form?
[06:55:00] <aqeel> anything we can start with you have on your page, or need to build from scratch
[06:55:06] <Frosty> I have.... I just want to know how to use jQuery to increment the code that spawns the form... and deletes or moves the previous "add" button
[06:57:37] <alcuadrado> I have a jq ui dialog with an anchor inside it. I attach a handler to the anchor's click event that calls .dialog("close") but nothing happens. If I execute exactly the same code from the dev tools it works... any idea? I'm completely lost
[06:57:45] <Frosty> I want the "add" button ALWAYS underneath the form.... and when pressing the button - the submited text on the form gets shown as text (the form itself disapears).
[06:59:34] <Frosty> I'm browsing the repository right now, but I can't find any examples of that
[06:59:54] <shoky> ?demo @ alcuadrado
[06:59:55] <bot-t> alcuadrado, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:01:57] <aqeel> add()
[07:02:01] <aqeel> amend()

[07:02:16] <abletony84> I got some ads that you can flip back and forth between: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/R7BNp/12/ - but how to give it extra width if it drops below the sidebar, and remove it if it goes back up? (code almost done - see the commented section)
[07:02:18] <shoky> wat
[07:02:59] <Frosty> Well, that's a start.... I' look that up right away, thanks aqeel.
[07:03:30] <aqeel> you are welcome
[07:03:45] <alcuadrado> shoky, it was a bug introduced by a coworker. wrong jquery selector. the button was also opening it. thanks anyway
[07:04:39] <Frosty> <aqeel> Did you mean "amend" or "append"?
[07:05:00] <aqeel> Frosty: after()
[07:06:32] <Frosty> Woot! Spot on <aqeel>
[07:06:43] <Frosty> Love you (no homo)  :P
[07:08:21] <aqeel> sorry was suppose to be append
[07:10:56] <Frosty> <aqeel> No problem. At least you pointed me in the right direction  ;)
[07:11:21] <ThomasBerends> Hi guys. I'm kinda new, and I want to 'slide' to a part of the screen. window.scrollTo(x,y) works perfect for me, but doesn't have the animation effect. Then I found out I had to use jQuery and the scrollTo plugin. But I can't seem to get it working.
[07:11:26] <aqeel> you are welcome.....glad to have helped
[07:12:19] <zwaasni> does anybody know a combined date & time picker, time as writable input field with autocomplete?
[07:13:14] <mobcat> huh?
[07:13:26] <mobcat> oh you mean like a drop down
[07:13:35] <mobcat> jquery ui has a crap one you can use
[07:13:45] <mobcat> becuase it's so bad people have made tons of other ones online
[07:14:04] <mobcat> just stick with the jquery ui one I guess
[07:14:41] <chasep_notworkin> I was able to use CSS to create a "menubar" using the menu widget. level 1 items are horizontal, level 2+ items are vertical, level 2 items show up below level 1 items (using the position property of the menu widget)... however, level 3+ items also show up UNDER the parent item, which doesn't work well once the items are vertical
[07:14:47] <chasep_notworkin> any ideas on how to handle that?
[07:14:53] <zwaasni> it should work like in outlook ...
[07:15:22] <mobcat> http://www.jquery4u.com/plugins/10-jquery-time-picker-plugins/
[07:15:30] <aqeel> ThomasBerends: might be missing a few properties?
[07:15:36] <finnnnnnnnnnn> Any one know if it's possible to add a second selector to this -  $(document).on('mousedown', '.some-selector', function() { } );
[07:15:36] <finnnnnnnnnnn> ?
[07:16:04] <chasep_notworkin> I'm thinking i'll need to handle the event for when an item is clicked/hovered and then modify the position of the child based on that, and I'll also need to do some calculations to determine if it should be displayed to the left or right..... but wondering if anyone else had any ideas before going through the trouble
[07:16:15] <finnnnnnnnnnn> so I add the mousedown to 'some-selector' and another selector in the one lint
[07:16:21] <ThomasBerends> ageel: I have no idea. It would be great if I only needed to enter the x/y.
[07:16:47] <aqeel> you got your code sample
[07:18:02] <Gho5t> finnnnnnnnnnn: use a comma
[07:18:27] <ThomasBerends> aqeel: Not at the moment. Do you know how scrollTo works? (And how I could use it to simply move to a x / y coördinate?)
[07:18:30] <zwaasni> this is not exactly what i am looking for ... it would be great if someone could tell me how to extend jquery ui date picker; a text field with a selection appearing underneath is not that complicated
[07:18:31] <finnnnnnnnnnn> $(document).on('mousedown', '.some-selector', '.another-selector'  function() { } );
[07:18:31] <evident> hi everybody! I would like to have a marquee effect with jquery like here: http://remysharp.com/demo/marquee.html the problem is that this doesn't work if the text is longer than the width of the div. Is there another way to have the text that moves from left to right, if it's longer than the available space?
[07:18:36] <finnnnnnnnnnn> like that?
[07:18:51] <Gho5t> finnnnnnnnnnn: $(document).on('mousedown', '.some-selector, .another-selector' function() { } );
[07:18:54] <aqeel> there are tons of scrollTo, might give a link and i help oyu
[07:19:02] <aqeel> you*
[07:19:20] <finnnnnnnnnnn> Gho5t: oh right, very simple. Thanks very much
[07:20:16] <ThomasBerends> aqeel: I can't give a link right now.
[07:20:58] <aqeel> well i might not be of much help, as i do not know which plugin for scrollto are you using
[07:21:19] <ThomasBerends> aqeel: I saw an example with '$(...).scrollTo( 150, 800 );'. But I have no idea what (...) is.
[07:21:43] <ThomasBerends> aqeel: http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/ < Here I found it. :(
[07:21:45] <aqeel> it could be anything
[07:22:56] <ThomasBerends> aqeel: But I don't need to give an element if I want to move to an x/y coördinate right?
[07:23:08] <aqeel> http://balupton.github.com/jquery-scrollto/demo/
[07:23:50] <ThomasBerends> aqeel: That's where I downloaded the .js file. But I have no idea how to move to an x/y coördinate.
[07:24:43] <timholum> is there a jquery option that is essencially "first element with class after some selectory", for example if I have an ellemnt that has a class .option_selected , can I find the next ellement after that that has the class .option?
[07:28:38] <Gho5t> .next('.option')
[07:29:00] <yousaf> Has anyone worked with Google Maps API?
[07:29:03] <yousaf>  google.maps.event.trigger(map, 'resize') .
[07:30:58] <aqeel> ThomasBerends: http://jsfiddle.net/P9KbW/
[07:31:02] <aqeel> this is how it works
[07:31:31] <aqeel> from the site
[07:31:57] * hlve[working] slaps aqeel around a bit with a large trout
[07:32:20] <ThomasBerends> aqeel: I don't think I understand this..
[07:32:36] <timholum> Gho5t: Does .next() require them to be siblings?
[07:34:07] <aqeel> ThomasBerends: you need only  vertical scrolling or both directions
[07:34:19] <ThomasBerends> aqeel: Only horizontal (:
[07:34:38] <aqeel> wait let me google simplest for you
[07:34:51] <tankblergh> hey peeps! Are you guys familiar with the underscore array function "_.difference"? I'm trying to the the delta between two arrays that contain objects like {id:1, name:test1}, but that doesnt seem to work
[07:35:24] <ThomasBerends> aqeel: It's kinda weird that all the examples I saw had an element (like #foo ) in them. I just need it to go to a x coördinate.
[07:35:35] <huma> question: why hover doesn't work in this example? http://jsfiddle.net/kT95d/32/
[07:37:28] <Gho5t> timholum: yes sorry. if .option is in your current result set, you can just do filter it $results.filter('.option')
[07:37:35] <aqeel> huma, animate what
[07:37:39] <aqeel> width height
[07:38:44] <Gho5t> timholum: yes sorry. if .option is in your current result set, you can just do filter it $results.filter('.option').first()
[07:40:06] <Colmea_> Hello
[07:40:07] <Mr_Grim> hey.
[07:40:17] <Mr_Grim> does anyone have issues running jquery mobile on PhoneGap?
[07:41:56] <kasto_> hello guys
[07:42:30] <Colmea_> I have a little problem. I'm trying tu put the attr selected="selected" on a <option> with jQuery. Attribut goes well but there is no effect on the page
[07:42:38] <Saaether> huma http://jsfiddle.net/kT95d/33/ if you want to animate colors you need to add the animate colors plugin as ive demo'd
[07:43:18] <Colmea_> (Precision: the <option> is in a jquery mobile popup)
[07:43:18] <yousaf> Can someone please help?
[07:44:18] <kasto_> can someone please help me? jquery ebook?
[07:45:31] <klawd> yousaf: what's your problem?
[07:46:14] <yousaf> basically, I have some tabs and inside each tab I have google maps which doesn't resize properly
[07:46:14] <huma> aqeel: bg color
[07:46:16] <yousaf> http://jsfiddle.net/ZaYaq/1/
[07:46:31] <aqeel> $(element).scrollTo('target',ease);
[07:46:36] <Saaether> huma see my jsfiddle above
[07:46:47] <huma> ah, sorry. missed it.
[07:47:02] <aqeel> ThomasBerends:
[07:47:13] <Colmea_> Here is my jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ycGLu/
[07:47:24] <yousaf> klawd here is the docs for resize event https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#event
[07:47:44] <huma> Saaether: i think it was possible with earlier versions, no?
[07:48:12] <huma> Saaether: and thank you :)
[07:48:13] <timholum> Gho5t: Thanks, I got it to work now with next ( I tryed it earlyer and throught that next needed to use the same selector as the begining one )
[07:48:15] <Saaether> you're code works fine as long as you add in the animate colors library
[07:48:38] <Saaether> your*
[07:48:40] <aqeel> animate is for elements usually not colors
[07:49:00] <huma> Saaether: yes, i'm just pretty sure it worked before
[07:49:01] <aqeel> for colors need extra plugin
[07:49:23] <ThomasBerends> aqeel: But. I don't have an element for it.
[07:49:24] <aqeel> spliting happens, very often
[07:49:42] <aqeel> now what are you scroling, let us guide you
[07:49:53] <ThomasBerends> aqeel: The whole page.
[07:50:21] <aqeel> no i mean within that page to have to scroll to somewhere right
[07:50:27] <klawd> yousaf: your problem is not with the tabs per se
[07:50:47] <klawd> yousaf: the tab doesn't know how big the content will be, so it's zero sized
[07:50:51] <klawd> something along those lines
[07:50:52] <ThomasBerends> aqeel: It scrolls to a div.
[07:51:19] <klawd> yousaf: actually, disregard. gmaps doesn't know how big it's parent element is when you initialize it in an invisible tab
[07:51:28] <Colmea_> Nobody know why my attr('selected', 'selected')  doesn't work on a <option> ?
[07:51:32] <aqeel> $(document).scrollTo('div you want to scroll to',800);
[07:51:34] <klawd> yousaf: you should initialize it the first time the tab is opened
[07:51:34] <yousaf> klawd how do I work around it?
[07:52:05] <NoiseEee> Colmea_: $(selectElement).setValue(theValue)
[07:52:15] <klawd> yousaf: at least that is what i did couple years ago. maybe now you can pass some arguments to define the size
[07:52:22] <klawd> with gmaps3
[07:53:30] <ThomasBerends> aqeel: It says 'TypeError: Object #<HTMLDocument> has no method 'scrollTo'' :(
[07:53:43] <Eviltwin> ThomasBerends: Notice the $()
[07:55:11] <ThomasBerends> aqeel, Eviltwin: It still says 'TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'scrollTo' :(
[07:55:28] <aqeel> can we see how are you writing your code of this line
[07:55:41] <ThomasBerends> aqeel: I'm currently trying in the chrome console.
[07:55:43] <Colmea_> NoiseEee > I don't get it. Yo have a new attribut on my <option>, Should I not use attr method ?
[07:55:59] <Colmea_> To have*
[07:56:06] <Eviltwin> Oh, isn't it $.scrollTo('selector', 800);
[07:56:07] <NoiseEee> Colmea_: no, you're really setting the value of the <select> element, are you not?
[07:56:16] <Eviltwin> I don't use the plguin often
[07:56:19] <Pupeno_w> In jquery-ui 1.9 in the tabs widget the select method was deprecated, the documentation says to set the option "active" but I'm currently passing the tab name, not the index number to select. How can I find the index number of a tab by name?

[07:58:55] <kasto> can someone please help me?
[07:58:56] <NoiseEee> Colmea_: you're not so much setting an attribute on an <option> as giving its <select> a value.
[07:59:04] <vlad_starkov> socialhapy: nice:) I think it'd be awesome to rename you to Siri
[07:59:21] <NoiseEee> Colmea_: and when you tell the <select> what value you want, it chooses/selects the option with the value you specified

[08:14:16] <Pupeno_w> Is it possible to activate a tab in jquery-ui by anchor name? It seems to be impossible.

[08:32:21] <dsagastume> Somebody?
[08:32:35] <dns-away> Hello
[08:37:33] <dsagastume> Any help on jQueryMobile?
[08:37:49] <nerk> when building a jquery mobile site (mutli views), where do you put the JS in each view to prevent it from doubling up execution?
[08:37:57] <nerk> right now.. I have JS in each view, included in the content div
[08:38:24] <nerk> and I call a particular function from each view... when I put an alert('wtf?') in that function, I can see it doubling up
[08:39:08] <nerk> eg./ first view page1.html, I see one wtf?, then I navigate to page2.html and I see wtf? and wtf?
[08:39:09] <nerk> and so on
[08:46:23] <hlve[working]> sooo
[08:46:31] <hlve[working]> just had a meeting with one of my bosses
[08:46:42] <hlve[working]> left the meeting. coworker told me my fly was down
[08:46:43] <hlve[working]> :(
[08:48:20] <NoiseEee> bad day to not wear underwear i guess :(
[08:48:45] <nerk> so, let me get this straight.. the idea behind jquery mobile is that you include your set of scripts, including your own custom scripting once.. from the index.. then you bind things to views via pageshow and .ui-page-active dom elements?
[08:48:48] <nerk> best practice?
[08:49:29] <nerk> because I was including scripting in the views, each view's content area.. makes sense why shit would just keep bubbling.
[09:02:56] <karstenk1977_> http://pastebin.com/Dpdxn6K0
[09:03:11] <karstenk1977_> please can you help me correct this array?
[09:03:49] <karstenk1977_> the value should be overwritten with the wrap
[09:04:09] <NoiseEee> fyi http://ajpiano.com/when-to-use-jquerys-map-methods/ @ karstenk1977_
[09:07:25] <karstenk1977_> mh, how can I wrap every value of my array?
[09:07:26] <karstenk1977_> value.wrap('<div class="panel"><div class="panel-wrapper"><h2 class="title hidden">Panel 1</h2><p>' + value + '</p></div></div>');
[09:07:28] <karstenk1977_> wonÂ´t work
[09:07:39] <dsagastume> How can I "turn off" theming on jQueryMobile?
[09:07:39] <karstenk1977_> TypeError: value.wrap is not a function
[09:07:57] <karstenk1977_> the value is an img tag
[09:09:37] <donburks> karstenk1977_: Is 'value' your array?
[09:09:53] <karstenk1977_> no content is the array
[09:10:15] <donburks> And what do you want to wrap each value in the content array with?
[09:10:17] <donburks> A div?
[09:10:47] <karstenk1977_> yes every value is an img tag and i want to wrap them with divs and push back in array
[09:11:17] <donburks> Have you looked at .each()?
[09:11:31] <karstenk1977_> http://pastebin.com/Dpdxn6K0
[09:12:21] <donburks> Make a new array to hold the results. What you're doing is just appending to your input array.
[09:12:53] <Gho5t> can't you use wrap
[09:14:06] <donburks> He's wrapping complex HTML around the <img>
[09:15:03] <karstenk1977_> ok, with push in a new array it works, i would like to overwrite, but doesnÂ´t matter
[09:15:56] <donburks> Then instead of doing .push() do content[index]=
[09:16:09] <donburks> That would overwrite.
[09:17:22] <karstenk1977_> TypeError: content[index] is not a function
[09:17:37] <karstenk1977_> ah sry
[09:18:09] <karstenk1977_> perfect
[09:18:11] <karstenk1977_> it works
[09:18:14] <karstenk1977_> thanks
[09:18:18] <donburks> Np
[09:19:10] <karstenk1977_> but before I append my Array, how can I delete the comma?
[09:19:38] <karstenk1977_> append without the seperator comma?!
[09:19:49] <donburks> Which separator comma?
[09:19:56] <karstenk1977_> in the array
[09:20:06] <donburks> Show me?
[09:20:09] <NoiseEee> you mean turn [1,2,3,4,5] into 12345?
[09:20:27] <karstenk1977_> yes

[09:20:49] <donburks> What s/he said.
[09:20:52] <therealklanni> he
[09:20:58] <donburks> I was hedging my bets.
[09:21:05] <therealklanni> Well played
[09:21:08] <donburks> Thank you.
[09:21:20] <therealklanni> It's pretty much a 50/50 gamble :P
[09:21:30] <karstenk1977_> var Slider = beforeSlider+join(content)+behindSlider;  ????
[09:21:34] <karstenk1977_> content is my array
[09:21:38] <donburks> And even then not always clear.
[09:21:40] <therealklanni> Maybe 40/40/20
[09:21:44] <donburks> karstenk1977_: content.join('')
[09:21:51] <karstenk1977_> ah ok
[09:22:25] <karstenk1977_> perfect
[09:27:16] <karstenk1977_> ok last part
[09:27:21] <karstenk1977_> please have a look
[09:27:22] <karstenk1977_> http://pastebin.com/QJP0q4WM
[09:27:38] <karstenk1977_> now I try to set the title for every object in array
[09:27:52] <karstenk1977_> but I get undefined
[09:28:40] <ronson> When a project gets really large and multiple areas of the code require short term $('body').on('click', function(){" bindings, say like when a menu opens up and you want to detect clicking away from it to close it, are there any good techniques to handle this or patterns to use so that body doesnt get flooded with EH
[09:31:16] <donburks> karstenk1977_: Try title[index]
[09:32:09] <karstenk1977_> perfect
[10:06:42] <Colmea_> Does anybody know why I can select an option with jquery here: http://jsfiddle.net/ycGLu/1/ . But it doesn't work in my application ? Is the jquery mobile popup is causing the issue in my aplication ?
[10:13:01] <donburks> Can you fetch the val() from the select in your app?
[10:13:05] <donburks> It could be a selector issue.
[10:15:34] <mobcat> damn I just realized how many people are in this room
[10:15:41] <mobcat> how is this chat not flooded
[10:15:46] <Colmea_> My selecter is a unique id, I don't understand how it could be wrong
[10:16:04] <Colmea_> I just copy paste code form my application
[10:19:00] <dblosevn> mobcat: most of us just camp in here :-) we awakein when we see something interesting lol
[10:19:53] <mobcat> what interesting things happen?
[10:20:07] <donburks> Occasionally someone has a really interesting problem.
[10:20:16] <Colmea_> A really interesting issue on my application :p
[10:20:16] <BillCriswell> mobcat: Good question.
[10:20:57] <dblosevn> donburks++
[10:21:00] <BillCriswell> Colmea_: I'm thinking maybe you're just not calling it at the right time?
[10:22:18] <dblosevn> Colmea_: ^^eg.. before dom ready or before the node is injected in the dom after dom ready
[10:22:49] <Colmea_> i will check :)
[10:23:28] <BillCriswell> Colmea_: Seems like the right area to look maybe? http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/pages/page-scripting.html I don't know jQuery Mobile at all though.
[10:24:33] <dblosevn> oh its a jqm problem, most likely its what i said then, you cant use domready with jqm you have to use the custom page load event in jqm for that
[10:25:19] <nerk> is there a way to call the loading indicator from jquery mobile?
[10:25:45] <nerk> I am creating my own submit method on a form and prevent defaults.
[10:25:57] <nerk> as a result, I get no impressed button and no loading indicaotr
[10:26:02] <BillCriswell> dblosevn: Looks like $.mobile.loading()
[10:26:12] <dblosevn> Colmea_: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html scroll down to pageload
[10:26:22] <nerk> BillCriswell: thanks, i will ahve a look
[10:26:39] <BillCriswell> dblosevn: My bad. Meant to say nerk.
[10:26:43] <BillCriswell> Not my day, once again!
[10:26:47] <BillCriswell> nerk: No problem.
[10:28:07] <dblosevn> Colmea_: also keep in mind in jquery mobile ids have to be unique across all pages in your app
[10:28:21] <TrentonDAdams> I wanted to know a bit about maintenance of my application while using jquery.  Does jquery usually work with new browsers?  Or do issues crop up now and then?  Or, should I keep the jquery version in use up to date?  And if I should, what risk is there of it breaking an app using an older version?
[10:29:45] <danheberden> TrentonDAdams: regressions DO happen - i wouldn't ever, say, use latest on a production site
[10:29:53] <danheberden> if you're interesting in testing, however
[10:30:03] <tw2113> latest stable would be fine
[10:30:06] <nerk> BillCriswell: works great, thx.. and I am retarded for not just looking at "methods and utilities" :P
[10:30:10] <tw2113> don't use dev builds on production
[10:30:20] <danheberden> TrentonDAdams: http://weblog.bocoup.com/easily-test-jquery-pre-release-versions/
[10:30:42] <danheberden> so do what tw2113 said, and test new betas/rc's if you can
[10:30:43] <BillCriswell> nerk: It happens. Categorization can be tricky sometimes.
[10:30:58] <TrentonDAdams> danheberden: I am referring to production versions of jQuery, not pre-release versions.  Does that change your answer?
[10:31:35] <nerk> now if I could make my button disabled and impressed
[10:31:35] <danheberden> i'm saying you can test a new production version of jQuery (or pre-release if you like helping us) before switching
[10:31:54] <dblosevn> TrentonDAdams: I usually use a specific version of jquery, when it comes time to upgrade I test to make surre plugins arent going to break before i roll the change out to production
[10:31:55] <danheberden> so, like right NOW, go with the latest stable
[10:33:29] <TrentonDAdams> dblosevn: Yes, of course, I'm not going to just "shove it in" hehe.
[10:34:05] <dblosevn> TrentonDAdams: im saying instead of hotlinking the latest stable in the cloud i meant...
[10:34:10] <TrentonDAdams> And of course I will report issues when I find them.  What about the forwards compatibility with new browsers?  Is there usually issues in that regard?
[10:34:35] <dblosevn> nerk: $('button selector').addClass('disabled pressed'); then write some css to the effect
[10:34:58] <nerk> well, there is already a .ui-btn-* class for working
[10:35:00] <nerk> just trying to find it
[10:35:01] <nerk> heh
[10:35:09] <nerk> time to look at the css
[10:35:10] <dblosevn> ui-disabled
[10:35:14] <TrentonDAdams> dblosevn: Oh, yeah, I usually just download it to the local machine anyhow.
[10:35:18] <dblosevn> and i cant rememebr the pressed class
[10:35:29] <karstenk1977_> can I simulate an onSelect event of datepicker?
[10:36:15] <TrentonDAdams> karstenk1977_: I believe the date picker has handlers for knowing when things are selected.
[10:36:27] <TrentonDAdams> Oh, sorry, wrong answer.
[10:36:34] <TrentonDAdams> You want to force a selection, right.
[10:36:39] <nerk> I think .ui-btn-up
[10:36:40] <nerk> trying it
[10:36:56] <dblosevn> ui-state-pressed maybe?
[10:37:10] <karstenk1977_> I want to simulate an onSelect event, to run the function
[10:37:59] <danheberden> karstenk1977_: so trigger it
[10:38:03] <danheberden> ?trigger @ karstenk1977_
[10:38:03] <bot-t> karstenk1977_, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[10:38:37] <karstenk1977_> I run a complex function after an onSelect. Now I want to initiate it with the date of yesterday in my javascript
[10:43:33] <nerk> so, does anyone know a fix for jquery mobile's $.getJSON to work in blackberry?
[10:45:02] <donburks> If it's for a Blackberry app, make sure you have whitelisted the domain you're requesting.
[10:45:12] <donburks> Also look at making sure CORS is enabled on your domain.
[10:52:22] <Maz3> Hello, is it possible to set the height of an iframe via jquery?
[10:55:14] <Maz3> Hi, is it possible to change the height of an iframe with jquery? Excuse me for posting twice, but I got disconnected
[10:55:38] <datarecall> $('#checkout form :button.right').each(function (index, elm) { i am trying to loop through each button with a class of right but it doesnt seem to be working with that
[10:56:19] <nchlssmith1> Maz3: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/934323/control-iframe-height-with-jquery
[10:57:09] <Maz3> nchlssmith1: Thanks! :)
[10:58:26] <Maz3> nchlssmith1: Is this possible todo when the iframe is displaying content from a different domain?
[10:59:28] <nchlssmith1> to just adjust the size of the iframe or the contents of the iframe?
[10:59:32] <nerk> is there a known fix for blackberry and $.getJSON?
[10:59:52] <donburks> nerk: ^^
[11:00:17] <donburks> If it's for an app, make sure your domain is whitelisted. Also make sure CORS is enabled for your domain.
[11:00:21] <nerk> donburks: yah.. I have both enabled
[11:00:30] <NaCl> Where might I find documentation for older versions of jQuery?
[11:00:49] <nchlssmith1> Maz3: Im not sure why it would matter what domain it is from.  It all being rendered by the browser.
[11:00:51] <Maz3> the i frame. basically what i want to do is. get the height of the window of the users browser. then minus 150px from it, then set the result as the height of the iframe
[11:00:54] <nerk> and I haven't even built it out to a build yet.. but I do have domains whitelisted in my config.xml
[11:01:07] <nerk> right now, i have uploaded it to a web page and trying the json from there.. and it fails
[11:01:36] <NaCl> I know there's a bunch of "as of" lines at api.jquery.org, but I'm looking for a snapshot of the documentation as of a non-current version
[11:01:52] <nchlssmith1> Maz3: I don't see why that would be a problem.
[11:02:02] <donburks> nerk: Have you tested the code in your browser?
[11:02:16] <donburks> NaCl: I would check the wayback machine, perhaps.
[11:02:17] <nerk> yes
[11:02:23] <donburks> nerk: And it works there?
[11:02:28] <Maz3> nchlssmith1: ok, thanks. I'm just asking as I know that their are certain restrictions
[11:02:29] <nerk> it works in my browser, it works as ios and works as andrioid
[11:02:32] <nerk> but not blackberry
[11:03:36] <NaCl> donburks: bingo.  thanks for the idea
[11:03:47] <donburks> Np
[11:04:52] <nchlssmith1> Maz3: http://css-tricks.com/cross-domain-iframe-resizing/
[11:12:13] <kamoricks> I'm trying to do a cross-domain AJAX request. However, it doesn't seem to do anything on IE9. Googling revealed it's an issue with their XMLHttpRequest, and JQuery doesn't do workaround. I decided to adopt https://raw.github.com/MoonScript/jQuery-ajaxTransport-XDomainRequest/master/jQuery.XDomainRequest.js
[11:13:41] <crazydiamond> Hi. Does datepicker localization http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#localization not working only for me or for others too?
[11:14:30] <kamoricks> However, http://jsfiddle.net/9fUXz/ still doesn't work. Why not? (JQuery ajax call is lines 27-44.)
[11:15:23] <kamoricks> Nothing's showing up in Dev Tools error log or console - the request just isn't being made. Is there a different, better-used workaround?
[11:16:54] <nchlssmith1> kamoricks: i got this error {"error":"This key is not valid for this site."}
[11:17:27] <kamoricks> nchlssmith1: Right. That's what you're supposed to get. Try it in IE9.
[11:17:48] <nchlssmith1> sorry, I use linux I don't use IE
[11:20:48] <masak> I'm a little confused as to why live() and delegate() all got deprecated in favor of on(). can anyone shed some light on the discussions that led up to this?
[11:21:51] <mobcat> yea
[11:21:51] <ChaosBringer> Quick question guys: I'm using the .post function, and I chained a .error callback but it always executes even when there is no error...should I use fail instead? It seems a bit misleading
[11:22:16] <mobcat> it's better
[11:22:17] <mobcat> http://www.jquery4u.com/jquery-functions/on-vs-live-review/
[11:22:56] <masak> mobcat: thanks. will read.
[11:23:03] <mobcat> sure use what works
[11:23:18] <ChaosBringer> mobcat: is that at me?
[11:23:25] <nerk> so it turns out that jquery mobile and phonegap don't behave with $.getJSON
[11:23:55] <sukima> nerk: you sure? that is kind of a bug deal.
[11:24:15] <nerk> specifically blackberrys have an issue
[11:24:24] <mobcat> more than one
[11:24:29] <mobcat> first issue being a blackberry
[11:24:30] <nerk> I tested a blackberry hitting my app via a webpage.. the getJSON call worked
[11:24:32] <ChaosBringer> i haven't tried .fail yet... I'm asking because I'm using a swf object that allows javascript to override certain functions. Basically, i get XML from the flash object and then post that information to the server to save it. Sometimes it doesn't save and I figured .error would show me why, but it's not, and it's getting thrown every time even tho it comes back blank... dafuq
[11:24:39] <nerk> then I tried with the phonegap wrapper.. the getJSON call fails
[11:25:07] <kamoricks> ChaosBringer: erorr will be triggered on all non-200 status codes. What status code is the response reporting?
[11:25:25] <psyne> @masak my understanding that in addition to the performance increases the jQuery team wanted to streamline event handling.
[11:25:57] <ethis> Hi! :) Im trying to make a autocomplete with a mysql source and i have some issues with "searching" with Ã¦Ã¸Ã¥ and other "special chars", anyone know of a good solution when it comes to passing special chars trough to a php script?
[11:26:31] <masak> ethis: sounds like you have encoding issues.
[11:26:34] <kamoricks> ethis: Specify content encoding. Everywhere. Make sure it's utf-8, everywhere. MySQL wants it to not be UTF-8. PHP wants it to not be UTF-8. HTML wants it to be UTF-8. Javascript... is actually fine with it.
[11:26:39] <ChaosBringer> kamoricks: should be 200 (Using symfony2.1 and returning the ajax call with this: return new Response($returnVal, 200, array('Content-Type' => 'text/html')); )
[11:26:59] <kamoricks> ChaosBringer: Check with Firebug or similar.
[11:27:02] <ChaosBringer> i did
[11:27:04] <ChaosBringer> nothing on the logs
[11:27:09] <ChaosBringer> or console
[11:27:15] <ChaosBringer> and the PHP side executes flawlessly
[11:27:24] <ChaosBringer> it's strange
[11:27:26] <kamoricks> ChaosBringer: Uh. network tab. What's the reported status code? (I'm just removing the "should")
[11:27:55] <ethis> I have declared that im using UTF-8 in the html header, is there anywhere else i should do it aswell to get the signs through without geting screwed on the way?
[11:28:15] <kamoricks> ethis: MySQL needs to use the UTF-8 collation and be connected to with a UTF-8 charset in the driver.
[11:28:15] <mats_> i use fancybox to show content from wp in an iframe - can i somehow modify the address bar in the browser so it will display the url of the clicked link? now it's just domain.com/
[11:28:32] <kamoricks> ethis: PHP needs to use mb_* functions on strings and only use binary-safe functions.
[11:29:39] <dogarrhea> http://jsfiddle.net/ajBWd/3/
[11:29:57] <dogarrhea> what exactly does !important do?  does it just stop css from being updated via javascript/
[11:30:00] <kamoricks> ethis: Also, the form's enctype needs to be set to UTF-8.
[11:30:03] <ethis> kamoricks: everything works fine with php and mysql. if i could make html-entities and pass them trough to the php side instead of special-chars, and do a html-decode on the way back id be fine.
[11:30:04] <dogarrhea> or is this a jquery thing
[11:30:11] <NoiseEee> dogarrhea: a perfect question for google.  no, its a CSS thing.
[11:30:13] <kamoricks> dogarrhea: !important means it overrides all other rules that would otherwise take precedence.
[11:30:26] <ChaosBringer> kamoricks: on the network tab, i'm seeing two requests being made instead of one. The first one cancels (and an alert is displayed from the .error callback), after I click ok, it continues executing and it actually posts, wtf? lol
[11:30:34] <dogarrhea> so in that fiddle, i'm unable to change the css color to red until i take the !important out. this is normal?
[11:30:39] <kamoricks> ChaosBringer: Welp, there's your problem. IE9?
[11:30:46] <ChaosBringer> nope, chrome on linux
[11:30:47] <matteu> dogarrhea:  !important causes all further CSS rules to be ignored
[11:30:58] <ChaosBringer> firefox on linux sees the same issue
[11:31:12] <ChaosBringer> kamoricks
[11:31:17] <kamoricks> ChaosBringer: Okay. So uh. That's interesting. Got a testcase for that?
[11:31:44] <dogarrhea> $("#theColorBlue").css("color", "red !important");   doesn't seem to override anything either
[11:31:59] <matteu> dogarrhea: Two !importants will never work
[11:32:13] <ChaosBringer> I can create a pastebin really quick but the flash object i'm using makes it virtually impossible for me to actually show you (sucks i know) I'm hoping that I can still get help just by you guys looking at the code, give me a quick sec
[11:32:21] <dogarrhea> so basically !imporant is like private static const final dontchangethisgoaway?
[11:32:51] <matteu> dogarrhea:  it is final in that it makes that element's property immutable
[11:33:01] <ChaosBringer> kamoricks: http://pastebin.com/KFtqViMS
[11:33:21] <ChaosBringer> don't mind the {{ }} since that's twig (symfony's templating engine)
[11:33:39] <matteu> dogarrhea:  if you are using !important to override some downstream css rules, you'll have to change the style hierarchy to allow javascript manipulation later
[11:33:48] <matteu> dogarrhea:  and remove !important
[11:33:48] <vdox2> hello
[11:34:01] <dogarrhea> how do you remove !important ?
[11:34:18] <matteu> dogarrhea:  I mean take !important out of the code
[11:34:34] <vdox2> should i get the selected element and it's previous siblings with this chain: $("#testId").prevAll().andSelf(function(index,element){...}); ?
[11:34:44] <vdox2> 'cause it only returns one element for me...
[11:35:16] <matteu> vdox2: what does $("#testId").prevAll() return?
[11:35:21] <shoky> vdox2: .prevAll().andSelf()
[11:36:43] <vdox2> matteu: $("#testId").prevAll() does indeed return the previous elements of testId
[11:37:16] <ChaosBringer> kamoricks: alert(errorThrown) shows the alert but it's blank...like no error was thrown :/
[11:37:24] <ChaosBringer> do I don't know why .error actually fires
[11:37:26] <ChaosBringer> so I*
[11:37:37] <matteu> vdox2:  can you provide a fiddle?  http://jsfiddle.net
[11:48:43] <vdox2> matteu: hmmm...nvm, i think i got it to work now
[11:48:45] <vdox2> like so: prevAll().andSelf().each(function(ind, elem) {
[11:51:06] <mike029> hey everyone, i have a dumb question, maybe someone can help me out. i made a put to my server, and the response is   {"fid":"52","uri":"http://site/appjson/file/52"}    however, i can't figure out how to grab that "fid" value. i tried copy pasting some json parsing code but i keep getting 'null' for everything
[11:51:42] <vdox2> matteu: i didn't read the doc properly. the element added by andSelf is on the top of the stack
[11:51:52] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @mike
[11:51:52] <bot-t> mike, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:51:54] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @mike029
[11:51:54] <bot-t> mike029, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:52:20] <mike029> ...can't really make a live demo as it's part of a really complex app
[11:52:35] <mike029> i just can't figure out how to grab the fid from the json string
[11:52:47] <shoky> mike029: if its a string you can $.parseJSON it
[11:52:50] <shoky> or JSON.parse it
[11:53:02] <ryanneufeld> mike029: I can't help you if I can't see some code
[11:53:17] <ryanneufeld> mike029: can you pastebin the snippet?
[11:53:49] <shoky> you can also use dataType: 'json' and the argument to the done callback will just be the responose object
[11:54:12] <mike029> when i console.log -ed the result from the transfer it gave me that json string
[11:54:46] <shoky> then do what i said
[11:54:53] <mike029> i tried using result = JSON.parse(data); console.log(result.fid)    and that came up null
[11:55:06] <ryanneufeld> ?pe @mike029
[11:55:07] <bot-t> mike029, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net or http://jsbin.com otherwise I won't look at it. If I can't easily edit and save the code back, I'm not going to help you. Make it easier for me to help you by helping me
[11:58:14] <JFranks> I want to slide a tr up and slide another tr into it's place.. Here's where I am at so far:http://jsfiddle.net/w5jCh/3/
[11:59:04] <ryanneufeld> JFranks: you're using show and hide. Those default to fade.
[11:59:13] <ryanneufeld> I would suggest a hide, and then a slideUp
[12:01:03] <ryanneufeld> ?slideUp
[12:01:03] <bot-t> .slideUp([duration], [callback]): Hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideUp/
[12:04:19] <mike029> shoky, var result = $.parseJSON(data['fid']); ended up working somehow. thanks for the tip
[12:04:44] <Scott0_> anyone here use highcharts?
[12:05:26] <JFranks> ryanneufeld: Well that then means I need to detect the next element differently
[12:05:59] <JFranks> ryanneufeld: Since "slide" doesn't leave a tell-tale 'hidden:' CSS value (none|hidden)
[12:06:00] <Scott0_> more of just a JS question though. if I have a value set at foo.bar.name = 'baz';  how would I be able to retreive the index of bar by the name?
[12:06:18] <Scott0_> assuming multiple objects exist in bar
[12:06:33] <Scott0_> err I mean multiple bars exist in foo
[12:06:50] <shoky> Scott0_: wat?
[12:06:59] <Scott0_> ok lemme strat over
[12:07:00] <ryanneufeld> JFranks: http://jsfiddle.net/w5jCh/7/
[12:07:20] <kamoricks> Scott0_: foreach(var i in foo.bar) { if(!foo.bar.hasOwnProperty(i)) continue; if(foo.bar[i] == 'baz') { return i; } }
[12:07:27] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: object['name'] === object.name
[12:07:42] <Scott0_> kamoricks: that seems long, I was hoping there would be a specific functionf or this
[12:07:53] <Scott0_> ryanneufeld:  not exactly
[12:07:59] <kamoricks> Scott0_: It's a linear search.
[12:08:15] <kamoricks> If foreach didn't include non-object properties, it'd be two lines. It's four, as-is. Five, if you brace every if.
[12:08:15] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: you mean not exactly a solution for you? or they aren't exactly equal?
[12:08:24] <shoky> there is no index...
[12:08:29] <Scott0_> eh?
[12:08:39] <Scott0_> then how can they be referenced by their order?
[12:08:40] <shoky> it's a hashmap
[12:08:48] <shoky> that order is meaningless
[12:08:49] <JFranks> ryanneufeld: Bummer.. So probably best to implement someone's pre-cooked solutions.. ugh.
[12:09:02] <ryanneufeld> JFranks: well, you can do it all with animate
[12:09:06] <Scott0_> in highcharts the order of the items in the object have a numerical index based on order
[12:09:23] <ryanneufeld> JFranks: but you're gonna need some CSS to make it happen. Notice the css I added
[12:09:26] <shoky> well i'm talking about javascript
[12:09:35] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: Then it's an array
[12:09:49] <Scott0_> ok
[12:10:55] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: so you want to search through the references in foo, to find an object that contains a reference name = baz?
[12:10:56] <Scott0_> so how do I find the numercial index of the array based on its children values
[12:11:02] <Scott0_> yes
[12:11:02] <ryanneufeld> you don't
[12:11:08] <shoky> he probably wants some highcharts-assigned index
[12:11:09] <kamoricks> Scott0_: You want to search an array for a value?
[12:11:20] <shoky> which is probably some other field in foo.bar
[12:11:24] <shoky> or who knows what
[12:11:25] <Scott0_> well if the array isn't associative, then it has a deafult numerical index based on the order. correct?
[12:11:27] <ryanneufeld> kamoricks: no, he has the value, and wants a shortcut to the element in the array
[12:11:34] <ryanneufeld> there isn't one

[12:11:53] <bot-t> Scott0_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net or http://jsbin.com otherwise I won't look at it. If I can't easily edit and save the code back, I'm not going to help you. Make it easier for me to help you by helping me
[12:11:58] <Scott0_> there isn't any
[12:11:59] <Scott0_> lol
[12:12:36] <ryanneufeld> why don't you describe the whole problem, in stead of the one you're trying to solev
[12:12:41] <Scott0_> just think of an array with 3 children arrays each with a 'name'
[12:12:53] <Scott0_> I want to find the child array index value based on the name
[12:12:56] <ryanneufeld> those wouldn't be arrays
[12:12:58] <shoky> arrays dont have a name
[12:13:00] <ryanneufeld> they wold be objects
[12:13:11] <ryanneufeld> you woudl have an array of objects
[12:13:11] <Scott0_> no associative arrays in javascript?
[12:13:12] <shoky> well they can, but.. nevermind that
[12:13:22] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: are you a php guy?
[12:13:26] <shoky> Scott0_: they are called objects in js
[12:13:27] <Scott0_> shoky: im talking about a value caleld 'name'
[12:13:27] <someprimetime> nah you'd want oan object
[12:13:33] <psyne> he is probably talking about associative arrays
[12:13:33] <Scott0_> ryanneufeld: yes
[12:13:36] <someprimetime> s/oan/an
[12:13:40] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: good, me too
[12:13:41] <Scott0_> ok ill explain in php
[12:13:44] <Scott0_> lol
[12:13:45] <shoky> Scott0_: then you are talking about an object ( a hashmap/associative array)
[12:13:50] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: I know what you're saying
[12:13:56] <psyne> in which case you would do array[1]['name'] etc...
[12:13:57] <ryanneufeld> and js doesn't have teh same concept of arrays as PHP
[12:14:05] <someprimetime> where the hell has eddiemonge been
[12:14:11] <ryanneufeld> in fact the way that PHP calls their arrays arrays, is not standard
[12:14:18] <ryanneufeld> it's actually a hashmap
[12:14:22] <Scott0_> $baz = array(array('name'=>'bar'), array('name'=>'foo'))
[12:14:22] <psyne> but that is php so I am not sure it applies in JS
[12:14:41] <Scott0_> looking for the key for the array that has the name 'bar'
[12:14:47] <ryanneufeld> yes, so you want to get 1 if you have name=foo
[12:14:51] <Scott0_> yes
[12:14:54] <Scott0_> or 0 for bar
[12:14:58] <ryanneufeld> gonna have to loop it
[12:15:09] <ryanneufeld> you can use ?$.each
[12:15:10] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, .each() - Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[12:15:18] <ryanneufeld> you can use ?jquery.each
[12:15:19] <bot-t> jQuery.each(collection, callback): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[12:15:32] <ryanneufeld> You can use that or ?jquery.map
[12:15:34] <Scott0_> eh ok
[12:15:37] <Scott0_> sounds dirty
[12:15:40] <ryanneufeld> You can use that or ?map
[12:15:45] <Scott0_> ok thanks
[12:15:55] <ryanneufeld> any how, there is both map and each
[12:16:02] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: how would you do it in php?
[12:16:20] <someprimetime> you'd use a foreach in php right?
[12:16:24] <Scott0_> no
[12:16:30] <ryanneufeld> let him answer :P
[12:16:38] <Scott0_> probably an array function
[12:16:44] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: which one?
[12:16:44] <Scott0_> which retrusn the key value
[12:17:18] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: tell you what, I have to go for lunch.  But If you can write the code in PHP that would do what you want
[12:17:24] <ryanneufeld> and pastebin/gist it
[12:17:36] <ryanneufeld> I'll help you convert it to JS when I get back from getting food
[12:18:18] <ryanneufeld> interested in this offer Scott0_?
[12:18:22] <Scott0_> id probably use a combination of array_search()  key() and current()
[12:19:06] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: write the code, with an example array, put it here codepad.viper-7.com
[12:19:56] <ryanneufeld> once you understand the algorithm in php, converting it to JS should be a sinch
[12:20:02] <mobcat> viper needs to put a viper on there somewhere
[12:20:05] <shoky> $.grep is also useful
[12:20:10] <shoky> for filtering
[12:20:16] <ryanneufeld> ?$.filter
[12:20:17] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, .filter() - Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[12:20:26] <shoky> for an array, i mean
[12:20:28] <shoky> like $.each and $.map
[12:20:39] <Scott0_> I guess this iw aht im looking for http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2504685/php-find-parent-key-of-array
[12:20:40] <shoky> ?eval var baz = [{name: 'bar'}, {name: 'foo'}];  $.map(baz, function(item) { return item.name == 'bar' })[0]
[12:20:42] <bot-t> shoky: true
[12:20:45] <Scott0_> but that looks a bit crazy
[12:20:45] <shoky> er
[12:20:50] <shoky> ?eval var baz = [{name: 'bar'}, {name: 'foo'}];  $.grep(baz, function(item) { return item.name == 'bar' })[0]
[12:20:51] <bot-t> shoky: {"name": "bar"}
[12:21:06] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: it's because the only way to do it, is to iterate
[12:21:11] <Scott0_> eww
[12:21:12] <ryanneufeld> even if you use an internal function
[12:21:12] <Scott0_> ok
[12:21:23] <ryanneufeld> it's not ew, that's just how it works
[12:21:39] <ryanneufeld> array_search just iterates over each element
[12:21:44] <shoky> ?eval var baz = [{name: 'bar'}, {name: 'foo'}];  "index of bar is " + baz.indexOf( $.grep(baz, function(item) { return item.name == 'bar' })[0] )
[12:21:44] <bot-t> shoky: "index of bar is 0"
[12:21:57] <ryanneufeld> ^^
[12:21:57] <shoky> BleH.
[12:22:05] <shoky> though looping would be more efficient
[12:22:52] <Scott0_> I wish the developers of highcharts would have just used associative
[12:22:52] <Scott0_> :P
[12:23:02] <Scott0_> would make things a lot more flexible
[12:23:29] <shoky> could also be you're misusing it ;P
[12:23:29] <Scott0_> for when the amount of items in the array is variable
[12:23:33] <danzik171> so its an array of objects then?
[12:23:51] <Scott0_> yes
[12:23:59] <Scott0_> http://api.highcharts.com/highstock#yAxis
[12:24:00] <scriabin> just a general question - I have a web page of "Tasks" which a user can reject by clicking a "reject" button.  There will be about 20 tasks per page, hundreds of tasks, paginated into pages.  I would like a modal to pop up (or a small form that appears wrapped around the 'reject' button that forces the user to give a reason for rejecting.
[12:24:16] <Scott0_> http://api.highcharts.com/highstock#series.yAxis
[12:24:37] <scriabin> so am I basically displaying 20 forms on the page, all hidden - one for each reject button, and then showing them when you click the particular reject button
[12:24:40] <scriabin> ?
[12:24:46] <Scott0_> you specify the series.yAxis to the corresponding object in the yAxis array
[12:24:58] <scriabin> or is there a way to have only one form which works for all the reject buttons?
[12:25:10] <Scott0_> so if the order of the yAxis changes, then the reference is screwed up
[12:25:41] <Scott0_> I suppose I could force a key value for each object
[12:27:08] <Scott0_> so my only option is to iterate through the objects looking for the value, then return the parent id
[12:30:25] <JFranks> Why does this start to animate, stop, and then fade out!? http://jsfiddle.net/RGvwd/
[12:30:28] <Scott0_> see where it uses the index? https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/blob/master/js/parts/Chart.js#L440
[12:31:36] <JFranks> "Note that the target value of the height property is 'toggle'. Since the image was visible before, the animation shrinks the height to 0 to hide it." ... Umm but this doesn't work! http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[12:31:46] <shoky> JFranks: animating <tr>s doesn't work good, try to avoid it
[12:31:47] <Scott0_> and relevant code http://jsfiddle.net/NsJ3n/
[12:32:01] <shoky> JFranks: animate elements inside instead
[12:32:32] <shoky> or dont use a table..
[12:32:47] <tw2113> ewww tables
[12:32:54] <tw2113> ewww animating them
[12:32:56] <tw2113> eww shoky
[12:33:05] <dJquery> seems to be a bug in ui-dialog when specifying maxHeight    http://jsbin.com/ixoraz/2/edit
[12:33:05] <ravenzz> I love tables
[12:33:16] <shoky> ewwwww
[12:33:19] <ravenzz> lmao
[12:33:20] <dJquery> notice that the dialog is not 20px high
[12:33:29] <dJquery> try resizing it though
[12:35:00] <shoky> dJquery:  maxHeight: The maximum height to which the dialog can be resized, in pixels.
[12:35:27] <dJquery> der ddder
[12:35:50] <dJquery> shoky:  didnt read the description good enough
[12:35:58] <shoky> derpy
[12:36:07] <ravenzz> my tables fan colleague. took me aback when he showed me how well google does index his table layouts
[12:36:29] <shoky> ewwww seo
[12:36:30] <dJquery> shoky: but i would have thought that it wouldnt open larger than it could be resized to
[12:36:31] <tw2113> shoky, when was the last time you did a rerp a derp on some jquery bugs :)
[12:36:53] <shoky> lol tw2113 whatcha mean? my own derp?
[12:37:03] <ravenzz> I was trying to persuade him to welcome the no table for layouts practice
[12:37:16] <ravenzz> I had to give up after that lol
[12:37:16] <tw2113> play of words on a-rope-a-dope or whatever it is for boxing
[12:37:36] <shoky> dJquery: you can easily set the initial size with CSS...
[12:38:01] <shoky> dJquery: btw, interesting attribute:  css="height: 400"

[12:39:09] <dns-away> :-)
[12:39:26] <dJquery> I was just researching befor answering a q on stackoverflow
[12:39:56] <scriabin> if I have a list of tasks and each task has a reject button, and when the user clicks 'reject' I want a modal or a small form to display asking for the reason of the rejection, do I create 20 little modals, hidden, and show them when the reject buttons are clicked, reqpectively, or can I create only one modal and have it work for all the different tasks?
[12:39:58] <shoky> next up, researching on SO to answer some questions here, deal?!!
[12:39:59] <fonko> thanks BillCriswell
[12:40:07] <tw2113> close enough
[12:40:07] <fonko> i was going insane for such a silly thing!
[12:40:08] <BillCriswell> fonko: No problem.
[12:40:32] <dJquery> scriabin: yes you can
[12:40:43] <BillCriswell> scriabin: The second way would be better.
[12:41:30] <cstephens4> Hello
[12:42:02] <cstephens4> Does anyone here have experience with this jQuery plugin: https://github.com/weepy/jquery.path
[12:42:06] <JFranks> Okay how do I toggle just the height vs. the height and width? http://jsfiddle.net/RGvwd/5/
[12:42:24] <JFranks> *baby steps
[12:42:24] <dJquery> scriabin: do a google for jquery confirm delete and you should be able to find example code
[12:43:40] <cstephens4> I'm getting some browser inconsistencies with the jquery.path plugin and I'm not sure if it's my code or browser bugs
[12:44:07] <cstephens4> sample code: http://jsfiddle.net/jrPuc/
[12:44:08] <scriabin> dJquery: thanks that helped a lot!
[12:44:53] <PseudoNinja> Question: If I load the contents of another page via an $.ajax call and the javascript for that page loads into the DOM (which is fine) if I load the same screen a second time and the javascript comes down again (still fine) when using an .on() event will it trigger for both instances of that on statement, or just once?
[12:44:58] <cstephens4> a functioning example here: https://github.com/Unicode/ui-animations-and-experiments/tree/master/div%20bezier%20path%20animation
[12:46:03] <cstephens4> The animation in my example works fine in Chrome but the animation is buggy in Safari and Firefox
[12:46:13] <mobcat> what animation
[12:46:42] <cstephens4> a bezier path animation
[12:47:12] <mobcat> I didn't know jq could do that, sounds intensive
[12:47:19] <JFranks> HAHAHA.. Oh yeah that's working JUST like the documentation shows.. http://jsfiddle.net/RGvwd/9/
[12:47:20] <cstephens4> located here in my script.js file https://github.com/Unicode/ui-animations-and-experiments/tree/master/div%20bezier%20path%20animation
[12:48:10] <Scott0_> how do you debug in jsfiddle?
[12:48:24] <Scott0_> seems none of the functions are available in the console
[12:48:26] <cstephens4> mobcat: i didn't know jquery could do bezier path animations either until recently
[12:49:10] <Colmea> Hello again. I found where was my problem. I try to set de selected value in a <select> with jQuery ( .val('myvalue'); ) . It works perfectly; but when I use jQuery mobile (wich override the <select> class), the selected value is set but, ...not really (see what I mean: http://postimage.org/image/x51v6zu73/). Is there a way to "refresh" the <select> ?
[12:50:37] <shoky> Colmea: call .selectmenu("refresh") on it
[12:50:55] <Colmea> ok thank you :)
[12:51:46] <BillCriswell> PseudoNinja: Are you loading things into a common container?
[12:52:00] <Colmea> It works :) Thank you very much :)
[12:52:51] <scriabin> dJquery: it's a tad different that confirm delete.  I need to get the user to type in a *reason* for rejection.  This will populate task.rejection_reason in the database.  Thus the jquery needs to create a form that submits to Task#reject
[12:53:01] <PseudoNinja> I am loading all the scripts through bundling in .NET
[12:53:16] <BillCriswell> PseudoNinja: I was thinking like... $('.i-hold-dynamically-created-elements').on('click', '.this-was-dynamically-generated-item', function(){ // Do things! });
[12:53:32] <dJquery> scriabin: then just put an input or textarea in the dialog.
[12:53:33] <PseudoNinja> yes
[12:53:55] <PseudoNinja> otherwise it will not trigger on the first instance
[12:54:21] <BillCriswell> PseudoNinja: It should trigger for whatever is added to that.
[12:54:32] <dJquery> scriabin: in the ok\yes button function verify there is a value in the input\textarea
[12:55:06] <PseudoNinja> correct for every instance of .this-was-dynamically-generated-item within the .i-hold-dynamically-created-elements element it will trigger
[12:55:12] <PseudoNinja> that is how I have it setup
[12:55:43] <PseudoNinja> the problem is when it loads the scripts a second time
[12:55:55] <PseudoNinja> I am left with two of the same on statements
[12:56:01] <PseudoNinja> causing it to trigger multiple times
[12:56:34] <mobcat> huh?
[12:56:45] <PseudoNinja> The bad result is first click I get one window, second click two windows, third click 8 windows
[12:56:47] <PseudoNinja> etc
[12:56:53] <mobcat> show me your code
[12:56:55] <mobcat> in pastebin
[12:57:00] <PseudoNinja> one second
[12:57:15] <BillCriswell> scriabin: http://jsbin.com/ocenep/1/edit Weeee
[12:57:35] <scriabin> dJquery: I'm just trying to understand how the jquery knows which task the reason is being given for.  With a delete/confirm it doesn't really matter, because the ok button just allows the DELETE to happen, but the rejection reason submits a form to a specific task so it has to know which task is being changed
[12:58:11] <BillCriswell> scriabin: You can use a data- attribute for an ID and use that.
[12:58:32] <dJquery> scriabin: in all the example I have ever looked at for using a confirm delete they pulled the id of the row or some attribute
[12:58:53] <dJquery> scriabin: do you have an example of your html?
[12:58:57] <scriabin> BillCriswell: so the data- attribute in the button or link is how the javascript knows which task is being rejected?
[12:59:05] <dJquery> ?demo@scriabin
[12:59:05] <bot-t> scriabin, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:59:44] <BillCriswell> scriabin: Your call! You can do it however you like. My old school ways always want me to put things in forms so if JS is off it'll still work... but totally your call haha.
[13:00:09] <BillCriswell> If you have JS now-a-days you should be beat up in public.
[13:00:16] <BillCriswell> JS off *
[13:02:29] <scriabin> dJquery: I'm just trying to think about it right now - getting the big picture before I start coding.  I'm sorry if that's annoying for you but it helps me not to go down too many blind alleys
[13:02:34] <scriabin> thanks so much for your help
[13:04:57] <LindsayMac> Hey guys. i'm having some weird issues with a plugin called "big video" which basically sets a large video background for my site. It seems to work perfectly until you view it on a smaller monitor (or you shrink your screen to 1024 size) If you shrink down and then scroll down you can see that the video is fitting to the width and therefore you are seeing empty space across the bottom. This is not supposed to happen
[13:04:57] <LindsayMac> . it's supposed to crop it if the aspect ratio isn't right so it still fills the screen.
[13:05:10] <LindsayMac> an example can be seen here: http://mcginnis.bscdeveloper.com/news-events/
[13:05:26] <LindsayMac> or here http://mcginnis.bscdeveloper.com/blog/
[13:06:37] <LindsayMac> it seems like somehow the body tag isn't going the entire height
[13:06:50] <BillCriswell> scriabin: No problemooooo
[13:06:56] <ProLoser> anyone here use ui-sortable?
[13:07:01] <ProLoser> i'm having bugs when using it with inline-block
[13:07:05] <ProLoser> http://plnkr.co/edit/4kF7mV?p=preview
[13:10:11] <mobcat> looken
[13:10:25] <mobcat> where's the bug?
[13:10:52] <dJquery> like that plnkr interface
[13:10:57] <ryanneufeld> ProLoser: Seems to work fine here
[13:10:58] <dJquery> too bad its so slow
[13:11:00] <mobcat> wat?
[13:11:16] <ProLoser> ryanneufeld: try moving it around quickly and slowly
[13:11:18] <ProLoser> it seems to skip around
[13:11:27] <ProLoser> also, do it in chrome
[13:11:29] <ProLoser> not ff
[13:11:36] <ProLoser> you'll see them all move when you start dragging
[13:11:36] <mobcat> skip around?
[13:11:41] <ProLoser> yes
[13:11:46] <ryanneufeld> ProLoser: I am, that's due to the nature of sortable
[13:12:00] <ProLoser> occasionally the items don't move over
[13:12:08] <ProLoser> like you'll move over 5 spaces befure the placeholder relocates
[13:12:18] <ryanneufeld> ok
[13:12:19] <ProLoser> i believe it's because they are inline elements and not block
[13:12:23] <ProLoser> brb
[13:12:27] <ryanneufeld> I now officially Fucking hate plnkr
[13:12:33] <BillCriswell> I'm having no issues here in Chrome.
[13:12:40] <mobcat> the hell is plnkr
[13:12:43] <ryanneufeld> CMD+L SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AWAY FROM ME
[13:12:56] <BillCriswell> ryanneufeld: Definitely should not.
[13:13:19] <ryanneufeld> yeah, well the ahole who wrote this thing seems to think that it's fine
[13:13:51] <BillCriswell> The audacity.
[13:14:15] <ryanneufeld> I had to use my mouse BillCriswell, MY
[13:14:18] <ryanneufeld> MOUSE!

[13:14:30] <BillCriswell> Mother fuckers.
[13:14:41] <jacoluta_> It is possible to wait for a previous ajax call to complete before another one can be sent
[13:14:56] <ryanneufeld> jacoluta_: see ?deferred
[13:14:57] <bot-t> jacoluta_, http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[13:15:01] <ryanneufeld> jacoluta_: see ?deferreds
[13:15:01] <bot-t> jacoluta_, Read this for getting started with deferreds: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[13:15:04] <mobcat> yea turn async off
[13:15:08] <mobcat> async:false,
[13:15:10] <ryanneufeld> mobcat: NO
[13:15:17] <BillCriswell> Take all the A out of AJAX!
[13:15:22] <mobcat> lol
[13:15:22] <jacoluta_> ive looked into that. deferred are confusing as hell
[13:15:23] <ryanneufeld> mobcat: don't tell people to do that.
[13:15:28] <jacobroufa> favorite form validation plugin?
[13:15:28] <mobcat> why not
[13:15:30] <dJquery> ryanneufeld: cant believe that assehole wrote it that way lol
[13:16:09] <ryanneufeld> mobcat: because it's a bad idea. And that option will be removed in future versions
[13:16:15] <ryanneufeld> dJquery: was it you? did you write it?
[13:16:23] <jacoluta_> its the same ajax call over and over again
[13:16:28] <dJquery> nopers thought it was u
[13:16:28] <jacoluta_> its not a chain of them
[13:16:34] <jacoluta_> i need to execute
[13:16:59] <ryanneufeld> jacoluta_: http://www.everytalk.tv/talks/1045-JQuery-I-promise-to-show-you-when-to-use-Deferreds
[13:17:08] <ryanneufeld> Watch that
[13:17:18] <mobcat> I don't see anything in the documentation about async false going away
[13:17:20] <dJquery> is it a bug that ui.dialog opens with a larger size than specified in the maxHeight and maxWidth settings?
[13:18:12] <mobcat> right on use that
[13:18:14] <ryanneufeld> mobcat: As of jQuery 1.8, the use of async: false with jqXHR ($.Deferred) is deprecated; you must use the complete/success/error callbacks.
[13:18:47] <ryanneufeld> mobcat: "Note that synchronous requests may temporarily lock the browser, disabling any actions while the request is active."
[13:18:53] <ryanneufeld> hence, not a great idea
[13:19:06] <ryanneufeld> besides, deferreds/promises are a better way to go.
[13:19:37] <mobcat> so we nest ajax calls now if we want async false behaviour?
[13:19:48] <ryanneufeld> mobcat: no, use deferreds
[13:19:58] <ryanneufeld> watch that video I posted
[13:19:59] <mobcat> watchen
[13:20:03] <ryanneufeld> it will make much more sense
[13:22:06] <rainabba> Why is the updateTestLevels() method being called more than once?  http://pastebin.com/CnjGpiJV  I'm sure there is a concept that I'm missing and want to learn so if someone can just give me some terms to google that will lead me to the concept I'm getting wrong, I'd be grateful. Not looking for hand-holding :)
[13:22:28] <Scott0_> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/75Ag3/2/
[13:22:43] <ryanneufeld> hi Scott0_
[13:22:45] <ryanneufeld> what's up?
[13:22:53] <Scott0_> ryanneufeld: sucessfully got the id
[13:23:19] <ryanneufeld> There you go, looks like highcharts had some methods you could use
[13:23:23] <Scott0_> ryanneufeld: but not useful till after chart object is created
[13:23:27] <Scott0_> lol
[13:23:34] * ryanneufeld shrugs
[13:23:34] <b-ot> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[13:23:49] <Scott0_> problem is I need the id in the same object as where im looking it up
[13:24:10] <Scott0_> hrmm..
[13:24:24] <ryanneufeld> not sure I understand what you mean
[13:24:57] <Scott0_> unser series.yAxis is where I need to eval that
[13:26:50] <Scott0_> ryanneufeld: referencing a value from that same array where im putting the reference
[13:27:05] <ryanneufeld> mobcat: Okay, so looks like I was mistaken, async: false will be staying, but you won't be able to use with promises, only with the callbacks. Which is fairly limiting.
[13:27:41] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: I don't see series.yAxis
[13:27:55] <Scott0_> err chart.series.yAxis
[13:28:16] <ryanneufeld> http://cl.ly/image/2g373I2r2U1W
[13:28:22] <ryanneufeld> no yAxis there
[13:28:24] <Scott0_> yeah its not there
[13:28:38] <ryanneufeld> so... I'm confused
[13:28:44] <Scott0_> because you have to use the indexs of the object in the chart.yAxis that you are using
[13:29:18] <Scott0_> you can tell a series to use a specific yAxis via the yAxis object index
[13:29:26] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: What exactly are you trying to do
[13:29:29] <ryanneufeld> what's your use case
[13:29:30] <ryanneufeld> ?
[13:29:41] <Scott0_> using names for the yAxis
[13:29:51] <Scott0_> rather than arbitrary numbers
[13:29:52] <ryanneufeld> as opposed to numbers?
[13:30:05] <Scott0_> yes, I don't have the oportunity to set the numbers
[13:30:43] <ProLoser> anyone here use slickgrid?
[13:30:51] <Scott0_> the amout  of objects in chart.yAxis will vary, as willl the objects in chart.series
[13:31:23] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: I see
[13:31:37] <Scott0_> by usnig names, the order won't matter
[13:31:45] <Scott0_> silly that they didn't implement this
[13:32:13] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.7.2/highslide-software/highcharts.com/tree/master/samples/highcharts/xaxis/labels-formatter-linked/
[13:32:24] <ryanneufeld> I found that in the docs forhigh charts
[13:32:36] <ryanneufeld> seems to me that you have a solution at your fingertips
[13:32:36] <Scott0_> not that same
[13:32:45] <ryanneufeld> it's not?
[13:32:55] <Scott0_> no
[13:32:58] <nerk> does anyone know how to get blackberry working with json calls using jquery mobile, phonegap build service?
[13:32:58] <ryanneufeld> it's text labels
[13:33:00] <Scott0_> im talking about the yAxis
[13:33:08] <Scott0_> and im not referring to the labels
[13:33:09] <nerk> yes, I have support.cors enabled
[13:33:18] <nerk> and yes, I have domains that I am hitting whitelisted
[13:33:36] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: what are you referring to then?
[13:33:43] <Scott0_> http://api.highcharts.com/highstock#series.yAxis
[13:33:51] <ryanneufeld> nerk: try #phonegap
[13:34:12] <Scott0_> ryanneufeld: just assigning series to yAxis
[13:34:40] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: you're not making any sense
[13:34:51] <Scott0_> lol
[13:34:57] <Scott0_> you can have many yAxis
[13:35:15] <ryanneufeld> right
[13:35:21] <Scott0_> chart.series.yAxis is used to specify which yAxis the series uses
[13:35:32] <ryanneufeld> mhmm
[13:35:42] <Scott0_> by the object index number of the objects in chart.yAxis
[13:35:50] <ryanneufeld> mhmm
[13:35:58] <Scott0_> im not happy with using the index of the objects for this
[13:36:31] <Scott0_> since the order of the yAxis could change
[13:36:40] <ryanneufeld> mhmm
[13:36:44] <Scott0_> im using php to generate the config for this
[13:37:02] <Scott0_> if it were as simple as just hard coding the yAxis and series in this wouldn't be an issue
[13:37:23] <ryanneufeld> I still don't understand the problem
[13:37:27] <Scott0_> ahaha
[13:37:31] <Scott0_> nevermind then
[13:37:39] <ryanneufeld> So far I've got this: I don't want to use the numerical index
[13:38:06] <Scott0_> because numerical index is not consistent
[13:38:31] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: can you update your fiddle with an example that illustrates the potential problem?
[13:38:47] <Scott0_> I can't because in jsfiddle all the yAxis are explicit
[13:39:11] <Scott0_> depending on loading data from the db, the amount and order of the yAxis objects will vary
[13:39:20] <ryanneufeld> okay
[13:39:27] <ryanneufeld> so you could have multiple data sets
[13:39:30] <ryanneufeld> correct?
[13:39:49] <ryanneufeld> and you want to have each one dynamically associated with the correct labels?
[13:39:49] <Scott0_> leaving the series.yAxis inconsistent with the object indexes in chart.yAxis
[13:39:54] <ryanneufeld> is that right?
[13:40:20] <Scott0_> labels aren't as important as having the correct scale, but yeah labels are configed in the same object as the scale
[13:41:37] <Scott0_> would be so much easier to reference the yAxis by a name because the order won't matter
[13:42:35] <Scott0_> in my db the series each have a yAxis configured, but depending on which series are being loaded, depends on which yAxis are showing
[13:42:46] <ryanneufeld> could something like this work http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/75Ag3/3/
[13:43:49] <ryanneufeld> you're looking at the highstock options
[13:43:51] <ryanneufeld> not highcharts
[13:43:54] <Scott0_> that doesn't change anything
[13:43:59] <Scott0_> yeah but it's the same thing
[13:44:16] <Scott0_> highstock is essentially an addon for highcharts
[13:44:20] <ryanneufeld> oic
[13:45:02] <ryanneufeld> and you want to have xAxis categories? or yAxis?
[13:45:11] <Scott0_> I guess I could find a way to specify the order of the yAxis at the same time as I create the series in php so that they remain consistent
[13:45:23] <ryanneufeld> That's what I was gonna suggest
[13:45:32] <ryanneufeld> it's more consistent that way any how
[13:45:53] <Scott0_> well associative arrays are nice
[13:47:01] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: or they can be a crutch :P
[13:47:32] <Scott0_> how so?
[13:47:37] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: Can you show me an example of the inconsistency?
[13:47:41] <Scott0_> they are explicit
[13:47:49] <Scott0_> no matter the order, it is what it is
[13:48:02] <Scott0_> you call the key you get what you expect
[13:48:13] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: Sorry, wasn't saying you were using them as one
[13:48:20] <ryanneufeld> Can you show me an example of the inconsistency?
[13:48:32] <Scott0_> no
[13:48:35] <ryanneufeld> like cut/paste the source from our php output?
[13:49:07] <Scott0_> there isn't anything specifi setup yet
[13:49:11] <ryanneufeld> ah
[13:49:25] <Scott0_> I know inconsistency could happen based on the data in the db
[13:49:28] <ryanneufeld> so you're in code design mode
[13:49:34] <raj> is it possible/reliable to send a websocket request as a reaction to a page refresh?
[13:49:44] <raj> websocket msg
[13:50:11] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: my suggestion, build something
[13:50:16] <ryanneufeld> see it break
[13:50:21] <Scott0_> ryanneufeld: based on the data in the db, as I essentially have series.axis_id  in the db
[13:50:39] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: I got that
[13:50:50] <ryanneufeld> you're rendering multiple datasets on one graph
[13:51:16] <Scott0_> yeah but if I could only use the db axis_id in the js
[13:51:37] <Scott0_> which is why I wanted associative array
[13:52:01] <Scott0_> if I don't then its whatever order they wee added to the array before getting converted to json
[13:52:16] <chaitime> is there a way to get the size of the available space beforea user would have to scroll?
[13:52:29] <shoky> make your own object (hashmap) mapping from axis_id -> index (based on the index you put it in when specifying the y-Axes)
[13:52:56] <Scott0_> I guess I could use php to hold the axis_id, then order the array by axis_id, then rekey the array and remove the axis_id
[13:53:20] <Scott0_> shoky: yeah associative arrays eliminate the need for creating additional mapping arrays
[13:53:33] <shoky> var idToIndex = {'id1': 2, 'id2': 6, ...}
[13:53:47] <shoky> (of course, it'd be built dynamically, not like that..)
[13:53:51] <Scott0_> yeah
[13:53:59] <Scott0_> I guess I have no other option
[13:54:16] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: you can sort the array in PHP
[13:54:35] <ryanneufeld> then when you json_encode it, it will be in that order
[13:54:46] <ryanneufeld> and 100% predictable
[13:55:01] <Scott0_> yeah, ill probably use the axis_id as the key, then sort, then rekey as numerical index
[13:55:17] * dogmatic69 pokes Scott0_ 
[13:55:19] <Scott0_> wait no
[13:55:42] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: you can sort in your query from the DB
[13:55:51] <Scott0_> dogmatic69: hating highcharts index based yAxis crap
[13:55:54] <ryanneufeld> then the data is returned sorted, and you just add it to the array
[13:56:27] <wachpwnski> If you are making multiple ajax request per page
[13:56:50] <wachpwnski> is there any way to guarantee one happens first and finishes before any others start?
[13:56:51] <chomwitt> i want to make an element toggleslide but i want it always on the DOM
[13:57:14] <chomwitt> i think hidden it removes from the DOM
[13:57:24] <shoky> wachpwnski: simple way is to start the 2nd request in the 1st request's done callback, etc
[13:58:21] <shoky> wachpwnski: you can also use the promises/deferred stuff like $.when and .pipe() if you want your code to be more expressive and elegant
[13:59:03] <Scott0_> ryanneufeld: oh I forgot something important, im storing the json for the yAxis array in a field in the db
[13:59:19] <dJquery> anyone got doc on creting unit tests for jquery ui
[13:59:25] <dJquery> havent ever done them before
[13:59:33] <Scott0_> ryanneufeld: which would be why it would be inconsistent
[13:59:59] <Scott0_> err I mean the series config is stored  as json in the db
[14:00:26] <Scott0_> {"yAxis":"foobar"}
[14:00:29] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: any reason you're storing them that way?
[14:00:30] <Scott0_> :P
[14:00:44] <ryanneufeld> as opposed to serialized array/object
[14:00:51] <Scott0_> json is more portable
[14:01:09] <ryanneufeld> portable to whta?
[14:01:30] <Scott0_> you can read it without php
[14:02:09] <ryanneufeld> can you paste an example of them?
[14:02:19] <Scott0_> example of which?
[14:02:21] <ryanneufeld> (now I'm just really curious)
[14:02:24] <ryanneufeld> your data sets
[14:02:30] <Scott0_> lol no
[14:02:47] <ryanneufeld> why not?
[14:03:59] <Scott0_> hrmm.. maybe the yAxis isn't great in the json
[14:04:15] <Scott0_> ill stick to static config values in the json then
[14:04:34] <Scott0_> and then use php assoc array trickery to get the mapping for the series to yAxis consitent
[14:05:48] <Scott0_> I didn't want to have column in my db for each config option, so I put all the congfig options in a column as json
[14:06:13] <Scott0_> so instead of a visible column with value of false, I have {"visible": false}
[14:07:29] <Scott0_> they get added to the dynamically created items at runtime
[14:07:59] <Scott0_> ryanneufeld: thanks for discussing this with me
[14:08:29] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: no worries
[14:08:41] <Scott0_> guess I needed someone to explain it to, to realize I was thinking about it wrong
[14:09:16] <dJquery> Scott0_: thatswhat I miss most about working in an office
[14:09:21] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: I think you need to re-think your data storage as well. storing json seems like a portable method now, but just having your data in columns/rows will be better in the long run I think
[14:09:26] <Scott0_> dJquery: ?
[14:09:53] <Scott0_> ryanneufeld: I know but I didn't want to have a column for every possible option
[14:10:17] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: that's why you normalize your data
[14:10:23] <ryanneufeld> ;)
[14:10:24] <Scott0_> ?
[14:10:27] <NoiseEee> many-to-one / one-to-many tables are a gift
[14:10:27] <Scott0_> normalize?
[14:10:46] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: see ?g 3rd normal form
[14:10:48] <bot-t> Scott0_, Third normal form - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form
[14:10:52] <dJquery> are you ever going to search by option? or are you want to change a particlar option for more than 1 item at a time
[14:11:00] <Scott0_> dJquery: no
[14:11:17] <Scott0_> figured I wouldn't be searching by the json values so it wasn't a big deal
[14:11:28] <dJquery> then it should be fine th way it is
[14:11:46] <dJquery> whats the db?
[14:11:59] <Scott0_> the way I figure, I can always expand out to columns later if needed
[14:12:02] <Scott0_> mysql
[14:12:22] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: yeah, that's always more work than you think
[14:12:45] <Scott0_> ryanneufeld: less work than using many to many db associations
[14:12:48] <ryanneufeld> if you normalize up front, changes are easier, and you only have to do it once
[14:12:48] <Scott0_> :P
[14:12:57] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: let the DB do the work for you
[14:12:58] <dJquery> max height in dialog  does not set the initial max height only the max it can be resized to.
[14:13:01] <dJquery> is this a bug?
[14:13:14] <ryanneufeld> dJquery: bugs.jqueryui.com
[14:13:15] <shoky> dJquery: didn't we go over this?
[14:13:16] <Scott0_> yeah if I need to add a value to every json, then it will be a hassle
[14:13:33] <Scott0_> versus adding a new column, then defining a default value
[14:13:37] <dJquery> shoky: briefly
[14:13:46] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: Also, by breaking your data out, you can select ranges of values, which might become a require ment
[14:13:48] <dJquery> but now there are peeps on I recognize
[14:13:52] <ryanneufeld> *requirement
[14:14:00] <shoky> dJquery: the docs say it sets the max height to which it can be resized.. and it does that
[14:14:03] <Scott0_> ryanneufeld: understood
[14:14:23] <dJquery> shoky: undersand what the docs say.
[14:15:03] <dJquery> shoky: its just a little glitchy when the initial size can be larger than the resizable size
[14:15:27] <shoky> why would you set the initial size to something larger than the resizable size?
[14:15:53] <dJquery> shoky: you dont have to set it sometimes the content just makes it so
[14:16:05] <shoky> then fix that ;]
[14:16:09] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: I'm fairly opinionated, but I've made a lot of mistakes with data like that in the DB, so I speak from life's lessons.
[14:16:12] <shoky> no bug here, move along
[14:16:44] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: Any how, good luck. I'd like to see what it looks like when you're done.
[14:16:54] <Scott0_> thanks
[14:19:48] <lz> any good resources for someone completely new to RESTful API design?
[14:22:39] <eydaimon> when I do an $('.blah').on('click'  ... isn't this a live handler that will monitor all future created nodes on the DOM ?
[14:22:58] <NoiseEee> no
[14:23:11] <VictorCL_2> hi
[14:23:13] <NoiseEee> but $(parentElement).on('click','.blah',function() {}) will, eydaimon
[14:23:19] <VictorCL_2> why does this goes into a loop : $("#header li").click(function(){ $(this).find("a").click(); })
[14:23:30] <VictorCL_2> I want that when they click on the <li> it will trigger the <a> that's inside
[14:23:40] <donburks> VictorCL_2: Because the click bubbles up in the DOM.
[14:23:52] <VictorCL_2> what's the optimize way of doing it?
[14:23:59] <donburks> VictorCL_2: If the li contains the <a>, then the li gets the click when the <a> tag is clicked.
[14:24:10] <firstclassfunc> Say a user is in an employee web portal. The portal uses an external site for changing user information. How do I pass data from the portal to the external site and redirect user, so when the user is redirected the external site has been passed the data
[14:24:13] <eydaimon> NoiseEee: oh. thank you!
[14:24:23] <NoiseEee> np eydaimon
[14:24:50] <VictorCL_2> I see
[14:24:54] <VictorCL_2> donburks what can I do?
[14:24:54] <eydaimon> NoiseEee: the deal is that the parent element must exist in the DOM so there's something to bind to?
[14:25:20] <slumbalina> are noobs allowed in this room?
[14:25:41] <ryanneufeld> VictorCL_2: return false; at the end of your function
[14:25:52] <donburks> VictorCL_2: There are a couple ways you can do it. One is to add a callback function in the $(this).find('a').click(); that looks something like: $(this).find('a').click(function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); return true; });
[14:25:56] <slumbalina> i'm trying to set up a web server on my Raspberry Pi
[14:26:08] <slumbalina> with this tutorial http://www.jeremymorgan.com/tutorials/raspberry-pi/how-to-raspberry-pi-web-server/
[14:26:12] <ryanneufeld> slumbalina: not sure what that has to do with jquery
[14:26:26] <chomwitt> i want to use effects like slide but i down want the elements removed form the document. can i do that?
[14:26:28] <ryanneufeld> donburks: return false; has the same effect
[14:26:35] <donburks> Truth.
[14:26:51] <slumbalina> ryanneufeld: well i've never used query before and i think i just setup a j query server
[14:26:52] <donburks> chomwitt: Use .animate()
[14:27:16] <ryanneufeld> slumbalina: jquery is a client side javascript
[14:27:32] <ryanneufeld> slumbalina: and has nothing to do with raspberrypi
[14:27:38] <mobcat> lol wat
[14:27:39] <slumbalina> poo sorry sorry sorry
[14:27:40] <VictorCL_2> donburks is not triggering the <a>
[14:27:44] <VictorCL_2> is doing nothing
[14:27:49] <mobcat> raspberry pi outta nowhere
[14:27:58] <chomwitt> donburks: thanks. i'll look at it
[14:28:58] <donburks> VictorCL_2: Sorry, I wasn't very clear. That's my fault. Define two click handlers. One for the li, one for the a (using the code I gave you earlier). Leave your li click handler the way you had it before.
[14:29:18] <ryanneufeld> donburks: lol qut?
[14:29:25] <ryanneufeld> *lol wut
[14:29:28] <donburks> ryanneufeld: Also..
[14:30:06] <ryanneufeld> no u

[14:31:32] <ryanneufeld> VictorCL_2: https://gist.github.com/4172346
[14:32:12] <donburks> Six of one
[14:32:18] <ryanneufeld> donburks: you don't need to bind twice. If you really want to check for that use, event.target
[14:33:23] <VictorCL_2> is not working /
[14:33:27] <VictorCL_2> look www.bufetemasramon.com
[14:33:31] <VictorCL_2> check js/general.js
[14:33:34] <wachpwnski> can i do something like $.when( var is defined ).then( //do something ); ?
[14:33:37] <rainabba> http://pastebin.com/CnjGpiJV Why is the updateTestLevels() method being called more than once?  I'm sure there is a concept that I'm missing and want to learn so if someone can just give me some terms to google that will lead me to the concept I'm getting wrong, I'd be grateful. Not looking for hand-holding :)
[14:34:07] <donburks> Check your pastebin, rainabba
[14:34:12] <donburks> Wouldn't work.
[14:34:25] <rainabba> Sorry. Timed out I bet.
[14:34:35] <ryanneufeld> VictorCL_2: did you see my gist?
[14:34:49] <VictorCL_2> ryanneufeld yes I did exactly that
[14:34:53] <VictorCL_2> now no link will work on the header
[14:34:56] <ryanneufeld> no you didn't
[14:35:03] <rainabba> donburks: http://pastebin.com/f6DyuBeV
[14:35:03] <ryanneufeld> you have two bindings in teh code I see
[14:35:53] <ryanneufeld> CTRL+A CTRL+C CTRL+V right there ^^
[14:35:58] <donburks> Yup.
[14:36:09] <VictorCL_2> I get too much recursion error in firebug
[14:36:29] <donburks> rainabba: Your success function is called when the source is successfully pulled, not when an element from the autocomplete is selected.
[14:37:02] <donburks> rainabba: So, it's running when it gets the data. Because you're running the map when you get the data, updateTestLevels will be called on every item.
[14:37:46] <rainabba> donburks: So I need to use an event other than success and not use map()?
[14:38:01] <ryanneufeld> VictorCL_2: as I have said twice now : https://gist.github.com/4172346
[14:38:09] <ryanneufeld> return false;
[14:38:11] <ryanneufeld> :)
[14:38:17] <donburks> rainabba: If you only want updateTestLevels() to run when it's selected, then yes you will need to put that function call in another event handler.
[14:38:52] <VictorCL_2> ryanneufeld http://www.bufetemasramon.com
[14:39:00] <VictorCL_2> check , firebug says : Too much recursion ..
[14:39:24] <anew> lol it looks like the guys head is the gavel
[14:39:40] <ryanneufeld> VictorCL_2: yoiu're not using the code I gave you
[14:40:14] <sunbeam> whats a good function working like closest() ?
[14:40:48] <ryanneufeld> sunbeam: closest()
[14:40:49] <donburks> sunbeam: siblings()
[14:41:04] <donburks> sunbeam: parents()
[14:41:09] <donburks> sunbeam find()
[14:41:21] <VictorCL_2> ryanneufeld yes I am
[14:41:26] <VictorCL_2> copied all u pasted
[14:41:38] <ryanneufeld> nope, you didn't
[14:41:50] <VictorCL_2> I dont see where ..
[14:42:06] <ryanneufeld> mine: http://cl.ly/image/2f3l352m0b0r
[14:42:21] <ryanneufeld> yours: http://cl.ly/image/201o3N0d1A0l
[14:42:34] <VictorCL_2> no thats old
[14:42:38] <VictorCL_2> do ctrl+f5
[14:42:51] * donburks gets popcorn. This should be good.
[14:43:00] <VictorCL_2> http://www.bufetemasramon.com/js/general.js
[14:43:02] <VictorCL_2> u see
[14:43:37] <ryanneufeld> VictorCL_2: the simpler solution, would be to use CSS to make your anchors the same size as the LI
[14:44:50] <rainabba> donburks: So now I get the feeling that I've been doing things all wrong and getting lucky. I should be using the success event with return for the sake of displaying the options to the user and then the select even to actually consume the selected value?
[14:45:20] <donburks> rainabba: Correct.
[14:45:42] <VictorCL_2> u are right xD
[14:45:46] <donburks> rainabba: The success event is just for successfully fetching the data
[14:45:50] <VictorCL_2> was complicating myself going the hard way
[14:45:52] <sunbeam> donburks: thanks
[14:45:56] <donburks> sunbeam: Np
[14:46:19] <ryanneufeld> VictorCL_2: very much so
[14:46:36] <rainabba> I'm not even seeing success here: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.8/Autocomplete#events  That the wrong reference? Trying to figure out if I even need it and how to use select.
[14:46:55] <donburks> rainabba: The success event is for your ajax call, not for the autocomplete.
[14:47:12] <rainabba> Ahh!
[14:49:09] <VictorCL_2> ok done www.bufetemasramon.com/
[14:49:10] <VictorCL_2> xD
[14:51:43] * VictorCL_2 too much wine
[14:53:10] <donkeycongo> Why is the change-event triggered on radio-inputs when the page loads?
[14:53:13] <rainabba> donburks: Thanks. I've been way wrong and lucky for quite some time on this one :)
[14:56:36] <donburks> rainabba: My pleasure. Good luck.
[14:56:51] <donburks> VictorCL_2: There is no such thing as too much wine.
[14:57:37] <zduffy> How can I hide all divs within a while loop?
[14:57:53] <zduffy> I try $("#selector").hide(); and it only hides the first
[14:58:09] <donburks> zduffy: You don't need a while loop for that. $("div").hide();
[14:58:11] <shoky> zduffy: Id's should be unique
[14:58:39] <zduffy> I have a while loop with a certain div I want to hide..
[14:59:19] <donburks> zduffy: You're going to have to explain your use case better.
[14:59:21] <zduffy> instead of doing div style="display:none;" I want to use jquery to hide and show them when a radio button is clicked
[14:59:51] <donburks> zduffy: Then do a change event on the radio button, and then hide the divs in there.
[15:00:01] <zduffy> I know that donburks, thats not my question
[15:00:13] <zduffy> It will only hide the first div, not the rest in the loop
[15:00:29] <shoky> why a loop
[15:00:29] <donburks> zduffy: Right. Because you're using an ID selector, which only is one unique item on the page.
[15:01:07] <donburks> zduffy: Instead, if you do $("div").hide(), you will hide all the divs. Or if you need all the divs in a container, do $("#container").find("div").hide();
[15:01:46] <zduffy> I have done $("div").hide() and only the first div is hidden. not all of them
[15:02:16] <shoky> lies
[15:02:26] <donburks> zduffy: Do you have an example link?
[15:02:26] <zduffy> Lol
[15:02:29] <rainabba> donburks: One more thing if you don't mind. Right now the item.value is being assigned to my INPUT instead of the label. Should I be controlling that with an option in AutoComplete() and if so, which one, or should I just assign the value in my select event manually?
[15:02:50] <zduffy> I don't. Sorry donburks. I will create a jslint
[15:03:14] <donburks> rainabba: Assign in select event manually, because you only want it in the input, when it's selected.
[15:04:03] <rainabba> donburks: "because you only..." In select I'm assigning the value to another (hidden) field. Irrelevant or all the more reason to just do it manually?
[15:04:19] <donburks> rainabba: All the more reason to do it manually.
[15:04:28] <rainabba> donburks: Ok, thank you.
[15:04:33] <donburks> rainabba: NP
[15:08:02] <bakers> If I have a div with three input elements in it, how can I craft an event to fire when focus leaves the div
[15:08:17] <bakers> I want to do validation after any of the input items change, but only as a group
[15:08:31] <bakers> i.e. not after EACH element changes, only when the grouping changes
[15:08:48] <rainabba> jQuery UI still doesn't have a native Watermark function or is it named something else?
[15:16:17] <rainabba> donburks: Hey :)  I'm manually assigning the label and with a break, I can see it working, but then the value is assigned and I can't figure out where. I have another autocomplete based on the exact same code (that I pasted) doing the same thing. The select event apparently isn't the end of it and I'm sure I haven't bound anything else that would cause this. There something in my autocomplete
[15:16:17] <rainabba> options that could be causing this?
[15:16:40] <rainabba> donburks: http://pastebin.com/f6DyuBeV
[15:17:15] <donburks> rainabba: *looks*
[15:17:48] <donburks> rainabba: That's the same one as before, correct?
[15:17:54] <rainabba> Oops. I just updated that pastebin with the new code. Sorry.
[15:18:01] * donburks reloads.
[15:18:06] <rainabba> I was confusing issues a bit too.
[15:18:29] <rainabba> This is the autocomplete code responsible for calling updateTestLevels though I'm not concerned about that bit for the moment.
[15:19:06] <donburks> I'm assuming both of the IDs you have referenced in the select event are inputs?
[15:19:26] <donburks> #TxtFindTestGroupID and #acTxtFindTestGroupID
[15:19:51] <rainabba> #ac is the one for UI (interaction/display) and the other is the hidden element used for other things.
[15:20:02] <donburks> Is it a hidden element, or a hidden input?
[15:20:13] <rainabba> #ac is the one being overwritten with the value after I assign the label.
[15:20:22] <rainabba> hidden input.
[15:20:34] <rainabba> <input type="hidden" name="TestGroupID" id="TestGroupID" value="-99" autocomplete="off">
[15:21:03] <rainabba> Heh, ignore the autocomplete attribute. Just realized that was point less there.
[15:21:08] <donburks> Ahh, okay. And the select event is not changing the value then?
[15:21:41] <rainabba> Oh, was the wrong element completely :)
[15:22:06] <rainabba> The select event DOES assign the label but then it's immediately changed to the value (I used a break to confirm).
[15:22:07] <donburks> That would explain a lot. :)
[15:22:59] <rainabba> To be clear, I just pasted an irrelevant element a moment ago. Not related to this issue at all.
[15:23:52] <rainabba> <input type="text" id="acTxtFindTestGroupID" length="40" />        <input type="hidden" id="txtFindTestGroupId" name="txtFindTestGroupId" />
[15:24:04] <rainabba> Those are the elements relevant to the autocomplete
[15:25:28] <donburks> So the text input should get the label, and the hidden one the value/id?
[15:25:46] <donburks> Ahhh.
[15:25:50] <rainabba> yep
[15:25:50] <donburks> Check your capitalization.
[15:26:09] <donburks> The selector for your hidden input does not match the id on the hidden input.
[15:26:20] <rainabba> I just cleaned up the names so that will fix any case issues. Checking now.
[15:26:49] <TheTraveler|Work> is there currently support for touch events in jquery core?
[15:26:52] <rainabba> Still doing it :(  Also, like I said, the label is being assigned.
[15:27:04] <donburks> To the hidden input?
[15:27:40] <rainabba> donburks: Oh, didn't check that yet. I'm focusing on the UI issue (showing value instead of label)
[15:27:45] <Scott0_> ryanneufeld: yAxisMapping = {"1":0,"4":1,"2":2,"3":3},
[15:27:47] <Scott0_> :P
[15:29:51] <rainabba> donburks: I keep getting confused. Think I better go take a break before I waste more of your time :)
[15:30:16] <donburks> rainabba: Np. I should be around for a few more hours if you need some help.
[15:30:20] <ryanneufeld> rainabba: waste as much of his time as you can!
[15:30:30] <rainabba> Thanks for the help and sorry for being so dense. I'll revisit this when fresh. Thanks!
[15:30:35] <ryanneufeld> donburks: yeah, yeah, I know also...
[15:30:38] <rainabba> ryanneufeld: Careful or you're next ;)
[15:30:47] <ryanneufeld> rainabba: no english
[15:31:06] <donburks> He's not joking. You should watch him try and type English sometime.
[15:31:06] <rainabba> ryanneufeld: Me either
[15:31:26] <rainabba> I only speak American; no English :P
[15:31:44] <rainabba> I leave that to the bloody Brits.
[15:31:46] <donburks> I speak the King's English. Elvis was from the US.
[15:31:54] <rainabba> LoL
[15:32:06] <ryanneufeld> donburks: also...
[15:32:12] <donburks> :D
[15:34:47] <ryanneufeld> I only speak bad english
[15:35:07] <obert> zduffy: did you tried if it is about css containing floats? like that the parent div is not wrapping the nested stuff in it?
[15:35:38] <zduffy> I figured it out. I just did on click on the radio button to change the css
[15:35:58] <zduffy> Easier than doing it any other way lol
[15:36:09] <obert> ok

[15:48:56] <twittard> Hi, question about storing objects created from jQuery plugin.  If I want to create a scrolling ticker, i.e. on $("#ticker"), and I want to create an object....  How do I store this for later use?  For example, $("#ticker").ticker() might do something like "new Ticker()".  Later I might want to do $("#ticker").ticker("next") to scroll to the next ticker element.  What is the best way to store that Ticker object, such that I can later
[15:48:57] <twittard> re-access it later?
[15:49:24] <twittard> Right now I'm storing it directly on the DOM element, but that's messy.  Is there a "jQuery way" to do this?
[15:49:28] <ryanneufeld> var thing = $('#ticker')
[15:49:57] <ryanneufeld> var thing = $('#ticker').ticker()
[15:50:03] <ryanneufeld> thing.ticker('next');
[15:50:08] <ryanneufeld> twittard: ^^
[15:50:30] <shoky> ?data
[15:50:31] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[15:50:56] <twittard> ryanneufeld: Yeah, I suppose.  I just wasn't sure if there was another way for separate references to $("#ticker") to hit the same object.  That'd make it more friendly, but would probably enable bad habits.
[15:50:59] <twittard> ryanneufeld: thanks
[15:51:22] <LindsayMac> Hey guys. I'm having an issue with bigvideo.js and I could really use some help. Basically for some reason the video isn't taking up the whole screen when the monitor is 1024px x 786px or smaller.. if you scroll down you can see an empty sspace that should be filled with the video
[15:51:29] <LindsayMac> http://mcginnis.bscdeveloper.com
[15:51:49] <ryanneufeld> twittard: the pattern var thing = $('#ticker'); is commonly called 'caching selectors'
[15:52:27] <ryanneufeld> twittard: so instead of reading through the dom each time, you have a stored reference to that jquery collection
[15:52:36] <twittard> Right
[15:53:40] <twittard> yeah, I just recall some plugins that have you interact with them by directly calling $("#element").plugin(...) each time.
[15:54:37] <donburks> You're still doing the same thing, you're just doing it in a way that doesn't make your browser cry unicorn tears.
[15:54:50] <LindsayMac> lol unicorn teams
[15:54:53] <LindsayMac> tears*
[15:55:50] <twittard> Right :)
[15:56:05] <twittard> thank you
[16:01:48] <aeos> Hi, is there a way to add a margin to one of the datepickers when you have numberOfMonths set to 2
[16:04:03] <Scott0_> how would I cast a strign as boolean/>
[16:04:04] <Scott0_> ?
[16:04:19] <donburks> Scott0_: Do you want to turn 'true' into true?
[16:04:24] <donburks> Scott0_: And 'false' into false?
[16:04:37] <Scott0_> I want to turn "1" into true and "0" to false
[16:04:59] <Scott0_> json_encode in php is turnign everythign into a string, im guessing because that's how it was created when pulled from the database
[16:05:25] <donburks> Scott0_: var bool = (string === "1");
[16:05:46] <Scott0_> what?
[16:05:58] <coldhead> wat
[16:06:07] <BillCriswell> wuht?
[16:06:20] <donburks> If there's a variable named 'string' that contains "1"....then (string === "1") would return true.
[16:06:35] <coldhead> ?eval var string = "1"; var bool = (string === "1"); bool;
[16:06:37] <bot-t> coldhead: true
[16:06:42] <Scott0_> try false
[16:06:45] <Scott0_> "0"
[16:06:47] <coldhead> ?eval var string = "0"; var bool = (string === "1"); bool;
[16:06:48] <bot-t> coldhead: false
[16:06:57] <Scott0_> very weird way to do it
[16:07:02] <Scott0_> there's no type casting?
[16:07:03] <coldhead> ?eval var string = "hovercrafts"; var bool = (string === "1"); bool;
[16:07:03] <bot-t> coldhead: false
[16:08:17] <Favorite> w0w
[16:08:21] <coldhead> ?eval Boolean("1")
[16:08:22] <bot-t> coldhead: true
[16:08:28] <coldhead> ?eval Boolean("0")
[16:08:29] <bot-t> coldhead: true
[16:08:35] <Scott0_> yeah I knew about that one
[16:08:39] <Favorite> unstupid bot -)
[16:08:43] <coldhead> ?eval Boolean(":(")
[16:08:43] <bot-t> coldhead: true
[16:08:53] <coldhead> everything is true to you isn't it, Boolean
[16:09:06] <donburks> ?eval Boolean(everything)
[16:09:07] <bot-t> donburks: ReferenceError: everything is not defined
[16:09:15] <donburks> :P
[16:09:20] <Favorite> :D
[16:11:02] <Favorite> ?eval alert("true")
[16:11:03] <bot-t> Favorite: "true"
[16:11:11] <Favorite> ok, thanks
[16:14:12] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: 0 and 1 are false and true respectively
[16:14:37] <ryanneufeld> if you want them to come through as proper booleans in your json, you'll have to cast them in your PHP
[16:24:43] <aeos> Hi, is there a way to add a margin to one of the datepickers when you have numberOfMonths set to 2
[16:25:22] <donburks> aeos: if (numberOfMonths === 2) { $(".selector").css("margin", "#px"); }
[16:26:14] <aeos> donburks: if i add the margin to the calendar, it no longer floats side by side
[16:26:23] <dariornelas> hi there
[16:26:30] <donburks> aeos: That's because of the size of the container, most likely.
[16:27:26] <dariornelas> I'm having a problem, I have a button with notifications (that changes theme when there are notifications), but it only works when I pass the mouse over the button
[16:27:37] <Bytephilia> I have a function that fades out one element and fades in another. How can I make sure the function cannot be called until the effects from the last call have played?
[16:27:48] <dariornelas> like in this page in the top-right corner http://foot14.korpro.org/
[16:28:04] <BillCriswell> Bytephilia: Use a callback.
[16:28:27] <BillCriswell> $('.one').fadeOut('slow', function(){ $('.two').fadeIn('slow') });
[16:28:37] <aeos> I havent as of yet figured out how to inlarge the container
[16:28:45] <dariornelas> when I pass the mouse over the button it gets blue, when it has more than 0 notifications, but it should be getting blue when I load the page, right?
[16:29:08] <Bytephilia> BillCriswell I have that
[16:29:18] <Bytephilia> But the event for the function is Click
[16:29:39] <Bytephilia> People can click 20 times before the effects finish
[16:30:01] <Bytephilia> anyway I can prevent the function from being called until it has finished completely?
[16:30:45] <donburks> aeos: Find the DOM element, and change the height/width.
[16:31:09] <aeos> which is tricky because everythings based on em
[16:32:44] <BillCriswell> Bytephilia: You can unbind the click event after it's clicked, then in the second callback reapply it.
[16:33:11] <ethis> i've got a .html() that includes some links, but i can't seem to prevent default and execute my own shit. tips?
[16:33:32] <ethis> on the loaded links..
[16:33:55] <BillCriswell> Bytephilia: That or you can add a class to it while it's animating, then when you click the element you can check to see if it's animation before running the animation. You would then remove the class in the second callback.
[16:34:25] <ryanneufeld> ethis: wat?
[16:34:32] <Bytephilia> Thanks Bill
[16:34:45] <Bytephilia> Second solution sounds like something I easilyunderstand
[16:34:47] <BillCriswell> Bytephilia: No problem. Hopefully it's good advice lol.
[16:35:06] <BillCriswell> Bytephilia: I just google real quick cause I was curious, this might be helpful: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2593195/how-do-i-rebind-the-click-event-after-unbindclick
[16:35:36] <ethis> im doing my own kind of autocomplete, so i get a list of <a> from a php script, but i can't $("#idofproducedlinks").click(function() {} if you catch my drift?
[16:36:44] <donburks> ethis: You want .on() instead of .click()
[16:36:47] <Scott0_> how do I make javascript recognize null as null instead of as a string?
[16:37:01] <Scott0_> actually null vs an integer
[16:37:05] <ethis> on? allright, ill try that. thnx
[16:37:12] <donburks> Scott0_: The string 'null'?
[16:37:16] <Scott0_> yes
[16:37:20] <Scott0_> well actually
[16:37:24] <Scott0_> migh not need to
[16:37:40] <BillCriswell> Scott0_: Doesn't sound like something you should need to do.
[16:37:46] <Scott0_> yeah even number will come throgh as strings
[16:38:07] <Scott0_> json_encode will give leave me with "null" or "123"
[16:38:16] <donburks> Scott0_: if (variable === 'null') { //do stuff; }
[16:38:23] <Scott0_> I se
[16:38:52] <pifantastic> Scott0_: json_encode should turn PHP's NULL into null
[16:39:00] <pifantastic> ?eval JSON.stringify(null);
[16:39:00] <donburks> Scott0_: Editorially, it sounds like you're having to make a lot of accommodations in your JS for how the data is coming from the server.
[16:39:00] <bot-t> pifantastic: "null"
[16:39:16] <donburks> Scott0_: I would suggest looking at how your data is being formed.
[16:39:22] <Scott0_> ok assuming its brought in from the db as NULL rather than  "null"
[16:39:25] <Scott0_> ill run some tests
[16:39:31] <pifantastic> http://codepad.org/wV7q49Pl
[16:40:13] <fiesh> can somebody tell me why something like $('body').on('click', '[type="checkbox"]', function() { jQuery(this).prop("checked", !(this).prop("checked")); jQuery.ajax(...); } ); will only execute the change of the checkbox, not the ajax call?  But if I just remove the prop part, it executes the ajax call.
[16:40:47] <rmurphey> ?demo @ fiesh
[16:40:47] <Scott0_> nevermind it handles it perfectly
[16:40:48] <bot-t> fiesh, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:41:01] <Scott0_> except for the number
[16:41:21] <Scott0_> brings it in as a string, but this library apparently handles it properly
[16:41:30] <fiesh> oh, yeah well I thought it might be an obvious stupid mistake... thanks I guess
[16:41:36] <Scott0_> so I guess "500" == 500
[16:41:38] <Scott0_> ?
[16:42:01] <BillCriswell> Scott0_: It is, not === though.
[16:42:01] <ethis> $("a").on("click", alert("clicked"); << this does work for all the links inside the document, but not for the once that i produce via my $.post, tips?
[16:42:07] <Scott0_> ok weird
[16:42:17] <Scott0_> types between languages can be tricky
[16:42:21] <BillCriswell> ethis: You need function(){ alert('blah') }
[16:42:43] <ethis> i tried that aswell, shortened it for the post.
[16:42:58] <ethis> function notify() { alert("clicked"); } << thats the one i used.
[16:42:59] <shoky> ethis:  $('body').on('click', 'a', function() { alert('clicked') })
[16:43:08] <shoky> best to replace 'body' with some other static container element
[16:43:16] <shoky> read about event delegation with .on()
[16:43:22] <shoky> ?on
[16:43:23] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:43:38] <ethis> fuck, i figured i had to do some delegation.
[16:45:45] <Funhouse> Hi there, I have a flash file from a provider and use js to load flash. Is it possible to find out if they clicked on the flash file somehow?
[16:47:50] <Bytephilia> Hey BillCriswell I'm having some problems. I think changing classes wouldn't be good for my case because I'd not only have to change the class on the element clicked but many more. It'd be best if I could just disable the event listener altogether. is that what bind does?
[16:48:18] <donburks> Funhouse: Set the wmode to transparent. Check for the onmousedown event instead of onclick. That will give you the best chanc.e
[16:48:40] <Funhouse> donburks, thank you!
[16:48:44] <donburks> Funhouse: Flash will eat the click event, but you can detect that the mouse was pressed on the container div.
[16:48:55] <donburks> Funhouse: ALso, put the onmousedown handler on the container, not the flash itself.
[16:49:27] <Funhouse> donburks, ok awesome thank you again
[16:49:39] <Scott0_> I think its interpreting the "500" as true
[16:49:44] <donburks> YMMV. May the force be with you. #hateFlash
[16:49:53] <Scott0_> how can I ensure its recognizing it as an integer?
[16:50:00] <Scott0_> to test
[16:50:23] <shoky> Bytephilia: unbind, yes
[16:50:30] <donburks> Scott0_: If you know it's /always/ going to be a number, use parseInt(number,10)
[16:50:31] <shoky> or .off()
[16:51:03] <Scott0_> maybe I sould be doing JSON_NUMERIC_CHECK in json_encode
[16:51:22] <donburks> Or doing an (int) in PHP on that variable.
[16:51:25] <BillCriswell> Bytephilia: Yes. That link I posted earlier could help for sure.

[16:52:33] <Scott0_> fail
[16:52:43] <Scott0_> json_encode does indeed support a second parameter
[16:53:00] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: yes, but the first param should be an array ;)
[16:53:08] <Scott0_> ah duh
[16:53:28] <Scott0_> still fails for same reaon
[16:53:46] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: http://ca2.php.net/json_encode#refsect1-function.json-encode-changelog
[16:54:03] <Scott0_> using a old version for codepad?
[16:54:08] <ryanneufeld> could be
[16:54:31] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: yup, 5.2.5
[16:54:32] <ryanneufeld> http://codepad.org/Il2CDtGm
[16:54:41] <Scott0_> its hard to can't in php for items in a nested array
[16:54:44] <ryanneufeld> also, clearly running on the comand line
[16:54:46] <Scott0_> *to cast
[16:55:09] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: that's why you do it when you're building the array
[16:55:25] <Scott0_> im not, it's a framework pulling from the db
[16:55:49] <ryanneufeld> https://gist.github.com/a37a248d23e47a063b35
[16:56:00] <ryanneufeld> what framework are you using?

[16:57:48] <Scott0_> ryanneufeld: using cakephp 1.3
[16:57:50] <ryanneufeld> yup
[16:57:52] <Bytephilia> BillCriswell I decided to just use a boolean. Appears to work!
[16:57:54] <ryanneufeld> sorry to hear that
[16:58:06] <Scott0_> ryanneufeld: har har har....
[16:58:19] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: cakephp does magic
[16:58:26] <Scott0_> im aware
[16:58:29] <ryanneufeld> it generates the models for you on the fly right?
[16:58:34] <Scott0_> yep
[16:58:44] <ryanneufeld> so it sounds to me like you need to write your own, or, modify them
[17:00:36] <Scott0_> ryanneufeld: there seems to be a callback I can use to cast them properly :/
[17:00:45] <Scott0_> you'd think that would be magic also
[17:01:29] <Scott0_> ah is PDO
[17:01:49] <Scott0_> http://cakephp.lighthouseapp.com/projects/42648/tickets/2965-modelfind-not-returning-the-correct-data-type
[17:01:57] <Scott0_> its PDO's fault
[17:09:10] <Caelum> I'm getting an "object does not support this property" error inside jquery 1.8.2 in IE8
[17:10:46] <Scott0_> the json_encode flag did the trick
[17:12:46] <BillCriswell> Caelum: You're leaving a lot to the imagination.
[17:14:07] <Caelum> BillCriswell: ie's callstack does not show me what I called
[17:22:57] <BillCriswell> Caelum: I mean.. is there a lot of code that you're dealing with? Would need to be able to see it.
[17:23:02] <ryanneufeld> Scott0_: nice
[17:24:22] <Caelum> BillCriswell: it seems es5-shim breaks jquery in ie8 :(
[17:25:47] <BillCriswell> Caelum: Not familiar with that.
[17:26:14] <Caelum> BillCriswell: es5-shim is the implementation of Array and such methods in modern browsers for older browsers like IE8
[17:26:23] <Caelum> BillCriswell: it must be breaking jquery's browser detection
[17:27:58] <BillCriswell> https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim/issues/114 Good times.
[17:27:59] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #114 on es5-shim (lukeasrodgers; 7m, 2w ago): Many tests broken in ie8
[17:28:15] <BillCriswell> Ohhhh that's fancy.
[17:43:31] <coderDJ412> This code works but looking to streamline it. Can someone offer some tips? http://jsfiddle.net/M2es7/
[17:44:38] <tw2113> looks as streamlined as you could get given the type of jquery code it is
[17:47:04] <Caelum> .load() is broken in IE8 :(
[17:54:59] <Hans_Henrik> is jQuery's $.ajax stuff supported in IE6? :o
[17:55:16] <mobcat> i think so
[17:55:25] <mobcat> just have a looksie to make sure it worked alright
[17:55:31] <mobcat> NOBODY care sbaout IE6 anymore
[17:55:35] <mobcat> even if they say they might
[17:55:43] <mobcat> everyone wants to forget that
[17:55:46] <mobcat> why are you trying to support IE6 anyway
[17:57:36] <Hans_Henrik> hmm actually i wont bother
[17:57:51] <Hans_Henrik> ill just require IE8+ compat (because thats the last version supported by WinXP)
[17:58:01] <mobcat> seriously =P
[17:58:10] <mobcat> IE6 is a travesty and .01% is using it
[17:58:15] <mobcat> forget about it
[17:58:25] <mobcat> watchout for 1 little IE8 bug in jquery tho
[17:58:34] <Hans_Henrik> what?
[17:58:37] <mobcat> $('body').on(....
[17:58:40] <mobcat> that'll freeze IE8
[17:58:45] <mobcat> use $(document).on(....
[17:58:54] <Hans_Henrik> o.0 okay
[17:59:02] <mobcat> that wasn't a fun bug to fix
[17:59:08] <snover> uh
[17:59:11] <mobcat> but w/e
[17:59:43] <Caelum> jquery works better in IE6 than IE8 :(
[17:59:47] <mobcat> lol
[17:59:48] <coderDJ412> tw2113: thanks
[17:59:58] <mobcat> I wouldn't know
[18:00:18] <mobcat> anybody actually have a proper way to simulate the two browsers? I never find those extensions accurate
[18:00:35] <Caelum> the only sure way is to use a VM
[18:00:39] <mobcat> right
[18:00:46] <mobcat> good idea
[18:00:55] <Caelum> there used to be this wonderful thing called IES4Linux, but the wine people killed it
[18:01:02] <Hans_Henrik> mobcat: VMWare, VirtualBox
[18:01:09] <mobcat> i use vmware I'll just try that
[18:01:25] <shoky> also browserstack.com
[18:01:27] <mobcat> I'm sure someone maintains old installs
[18:01:43] <Caelum> my page is completely fucked in IE8 :(
[18:01:44] <mobcat> does that work?
[18:01:48] <mobcat> lol
[18:01:56] <shoky> browserstack? yep
[18:01:56] <mobcat> don't worry caelum you'll fix it
[18:02:05] <mobcat> IE8 is just a bitch
[18:02:39] <Hans_Henrik> Caelum: what about IE7/IE6?
[18:03:03] <mobcat> let's just pretend it starts at 8 =]
[18:04:31] <tw2113> IEwhat?
[18:05:05] <shoky> ^^
[18:07:00] <Hans_Henrik> btw u guys heard that IE10 is very fast? it may help you download chrome several seconds faster
[18:07:21] <Hans_Henrik> but srsly, from what ive read, its very damn fast o.0
[18:07:47] <shoky> too very damn late
[18:08:19] <shoky> also, no windows-7 support from the get-go, wtf are they thinking ;S
[18:08:34] <Hans_Henrik> what?
[18:08:37] <Hans_Henrik> get-go? whats that?
[18:08:47] <shoky> from the beginning
[18:08:53] <shoky> of ie10
[18:09:08] <shoky> nvm ;p

[18:09:22] <Hans_Henrik> i think that was just some developer-preview versions, if so
[18:09:46] <shoky> yes, thats my point
[18:24:41] <s34n>  is this the right place for jquery-mobile discussion?
[18:24:53] <s34n> or is #jquerymobile right?
[18:30:42] <Caelum> aha, my problem was that IE8 ignores the onchange attribute for checkboxes
[18:31:34] <Caelum> or rather radio buttons
[18:32:41] <R00tk3y> Sup my jQuery bronies

[19:24:16] <BackEndCoder> http://jsfiddle.net/B3VCv/ hi i am trying to get a selecter for a div with the id of a dynamic click rel value
[19:24:18] <BackEndCoder> any ideas ?
[19:24:24] <BackEndCoder> (first day with jquery)
[19:27:00] <BillCriswell> BackEndCoder: What you have seems like it should work... unless I'm misunderstanding.
[19:27:21] <BackEndCoder> it doesn't alert
[19:27:32] <BackEndCoder> and it doesn't have the value of the div
[19:29:09] <rmurphey> BackEndCoder: live is deprecated for quite some time
[19:29:15] <rmurphey> you should check out .on() instead
[19:29:32] <rmurphey> but it looks like the issue is that you're doing '#'.whatever
[19:29:41] <rmurphey> like you're trying to use . for concatenation
[19:29:46] <rmurphey> you need to use + instead
[19:29:50] <BackEndCoder> right
[19:30:00] <rmurphey> chances are there's an error in your browser's console
[19:30:07] <rmurphey> ?ftj
[19:30:07] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[19:30:34] <BackEndCoder> if i used + would it do what i hope it is and save 'page' with with the id for a div as 'rel value'#
[19:30:52] <rmurphey> if i understand what you're after, yes
[19:30:57] <rmurphey> but, try it and see :)
[19:31:18] <rmurphey> and do keep an eye on your browser's console, it probably told you exactly what the issue was
[19:31:23] <rmurphey> or at least what line it was on
[19:31:35] <BillCriswell> rmurphey: Dammit. Didn't notice the improper concatenation.
[19:31:46] <BackEndCoder> no joy with console, cause it wants to load the page i am trying to ajax
[19:32:17] <BillCriswell> BackEndCoder: http://jsfiddle.net/ZAsnX/ example
[19:33:48] <BackEndCoder> thanks Bill i think i can work it out from that example
[19:33:49] <BackEndCoder> nice one
[19:34:40] <BillCriswell> BackEndCoder: If it's being dynamically generated you might need to do $('.paging').on('click', 'a', function(){ ... });
[19:34:59] <BillCriswell> Assuming .paging isn't being recreated every time.

[21:18:19] <s34n> that is, I want it to show which page I'm on, but hint at what pages are to the left and right
[21:18:50] <s34n> and when I swipe, I'd like the navbar to slide
[21:21:49] <BackEndCoder> hey guys
[21:21:56] <BackEndCoder> http://jsfiddle.net/PfJm3/ i got it half working now
[21:22:13] <BackEndCoder> but its not loading the next page, it trys... but yeah
[21:22:17] <BackEndCoder> any good debug tools ?
[21:28:18] <abjorn> :o
[21:34:04] <s34n> BackEndCoder: in you onclick handler, `this' may not be what you think
[21:36:35] <BackEndCoder> sorry this is my first day
[21:36:43] <s34n> ok. nm. it is what you think
[21:36:48] <BackEndCoder> i have updated it to clean it a bit
[21:36:49] <BackEndCoder> http://jsfiddle.net/PfJm3/1/
[21:37:16] <BackEndCoder> because of what it does when you click it
[21:37:28] <BackEndCoder> console doesn't tell me anything cause the page reloads with my ajax bit i wanted in the box
[21:43:54] <enderx86> I want to create an array out of a textarea's value [i.e. textArea.val]. I want this array to be sent as a JSON in an AJAX call. How to do this?
[21:44:09] <enderx86> I've tried arr = '[' + textArea.val() + ']' where I type into the textArea: 1,2,3,4,5
[21:44:17] <enderx86> or some other comma-delimited list like such
[21:44:26] <enderx86> But I'm getting a 415 Media Type Unsupported exception on a resource that expects a JSON
[21:45:38] <BackEndCoder> lo
[21:45:42] <clouder`g> what about split(',')
[21:45:52] <BackEndCoder> ok i think my $page value is incorrect
[21:47:07] <enderx86> I could do that
[21:47:17] <enderx86> Should it even be necessary, though?
[21:47:37] <enderx86> And what should my JSON look like? is {"list" : "[1,2,3,4,5]"} correct?
[21:47:45] <enderx86> Or can I simply send {[1,2,3,4,5]}
[21:47:49] <enderx86> or [1,2,3,4,5]
[21:47:49] <clouder`g> enderx86, or you could use eval() but depends on what you are doing how safe it would be
[21:48:22] <enderx86> a user is submitting a list of integers to a web application
[21:49:24] <enderx86> I think my main question is: what should a JSON look like if I want to encode an array in it? (1) {'array': '[1,2,3,4,5]'} or (2) {'array': [1,2,3,4,5]} or (3) [1,2,3,4,5]
[21:50:05] <s34n> BackEndCoder: http://jsfiddle.net/PfJm3/2/
[21:50:31] <coldhead> 2, enderx86
[21:50:40] <coldhead> but try jsonlint for sureness
[21:50:42] <coldhead> ?jsonlint
[21:50:42] <bot-t> JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[21:51:00] <enderx86> thanks coldhead
[21:51:32] <coldhead> 1 would prevent you from encoding the string '[1,2,3,4]'
[21:51:38] <coldhead> as distinct from the array
[21:51:47] <coldhead> which wouldn't be cool
[21:52:08] <BackEndCoder> s34n, thanks for trying, but it just breaks out the div shell and loads another window, 'Competitions'should be staying at the top :)
[21:52:51] <s34n> BackEndCoder: yes. I see
[21:55:58] <BackEndCoder> load has been deprecated
[21:56:01] <BackEndCoder> apprently
[21:56:07] <BackEndCoder> trying to work out what its been replaced with
[21:56:09] <enderx86> coldhead, to send an array as a json, is it even necessary to have a key, value pair?
[21:56:13] <enderx86> or could i just do [1,2,3,4]
[21:56:17] <enderx86> or {[1,2,3,4]}
[21:56:26] <enderx86> (i suppose i could use your link for that too, sorry :-)
[21:56:34] <BackEndCoder> but it looks like the $url is being set wrong
[21:56:52] <coldhead> enderx86: the O in JSON is for objects
[21:56:53] <Chel> question: what is better jquery plugin pattern, if you use TTD ? for example mocha. 1. is from http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring  where they recommend methods object. but how to set options array passed to init: method, to be accessable from other methods ?
[21:57:01] <coldhead> so you need to have key value pairs
[21:57:05] <BackEndCoder> if i break $url it loads a blank page as it should do not a blank page, but how it should load it
[21:57:10] <coldhead> it all has to go in {}
[21:57:15] <enderx86> coldhead: ah, i see, thanks
[21:57:16] <coldhead> jsonlint will agree
[21:59:01] <clouder`g> json lint actaully says [] is valid
[21:59:45] <Chel> can anyone say his(her) opinion ?
[22:00:23] <coldhead> you better do what jsonlint says, it's crazy
[22:00:35] <enderx86> haha
[22:02:26] <jacobroufa> ive got a dialog modal window that isnt respecting the height i set... anyone experienced this before?
[22:04:19] <clouder`g> jacobroufa, how are you attempting to set the height?
[22:05:39] <jacobroufa> as an option to the dialog object
[22:05:50] <jacobroufa> http://e-rockford.com/wishlist/ is the page this is happening
[22:06:14] <jacobroufa> the link that starts out "If you represent..."
[22:06:41] <jacobroufa> http://e-rockford.com/wishlist/scripts/wishlist.js is the script that initiates dialog
[22:07:01] <jacobroufa> its actually not respecting either dimension
[22:07:04] <coldhead> THE ROOTS AND THE RUINS ARE THE SAME THING
[22:07:08] <jacobroufa> height is the one i really care about
[22:10:52] <jacobroufa> clouder`g, any idea?
[22:11:06] <clouder`g> jacobroufa, I'm looking at it, so far no :/
[22:14:27] <jacobroufa> clouder`g, nevermind, im a moron
[22:14:38] <clouder`g> what was it?
[22:14:42] <jacobroufa> i had some other css that was overriding it because of absolute positioning
[22:14:50] * jacobroufa facepalms
[22:14:59] <s34n> BackEndCoder: this probably doesn't work in jsfiddle because of domain issues
[22:15:00] <jacobroufa> its always the dumbest things with me lol
[22:15:03] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take a five minute break
[22:15:28] <s34n> BackEndCoder: jsfiddle can't load the content from a different domain
[22:15:39] <clouder`g> lol, I was going to say that too, because I been there :) but I thought noone is as dumb as me :D
[22:16:06] <jacobroufa> clouder`g, i think we all make mistakes like that
[22:16:15] <jacobroufa> some days i feel like i make them more often than others though
[22:21:11] <fourcolors> does anyone know a good jquery datepicker that does a 3 field date picker like facebook does dates?
[22:21:32] <fourcolors> the jquery ui datepicker doesn't have a 3 field option
[22:29:06] <kborchers> fourcolors: i'm confused. do you want a datepicker or do you want 3 select elements?
[22:29:56] <fourcolors> kborchers: I want a 3 select elements but I want it to be smart about the days. For instance, if I select a month that only has 28 days in it, I shouldn't be able to select 29
[22:30:10] <fourcolors> so its a datepicker I think...
[22:30:31] <fourcolors> basically what facebook has on their front page to select a birthay
[22:33:50] <erdos> hey, when create an element with $("<div>asdf</div>"); can i still add attributes as a second parameter or has that functionality been depreciated?
[22:34:03] <erdos> because it don't seem to work, but the book tell me it do
[22:34:10] <aqeel> $(this).autoscroll("pause").delay(t || $.fn.autoscroll.defaults.delay, k, function () {$(this).autoscroll("resume");});
[22:34:26] <aqeel> delay occurs but never resumes?
[22:38:11] <fourcolors> guess im just going to have to build one myself
[22:38:12] <fourcolors> :/
[22:40:38] <coldhead> good luck fourcolors!!
[23:27:41] <karstenk1977_> Good morning
[23:27:55] <Needsha> http://jsfiddle.net/22ny4/ : Could anyone help me fig why it only scrolls once even though there is more content to scroll down
[23:37:36] <clouder`g> Needsha, it only scrolls once because once it gets to top 145px it's there. if you want it to scroll 145px in a direction every click you need to tell it to do that
[23:40:09] <Needsha> gahh
[23:40:11] <Needsha> @clouder'g how so
[23:40:12] <b-ot> Needsha, how so - Idioms - by the Free Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia. â†’ http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/how+so
[23:42:59] <clouder`g> one way would be to use a variable to save the current position and then adding 145 to it on every click
[23:53:40] <Needsha> I'm trying to achieve something like this : http://jsfiddle.net/22ny4/1/ would your suggestion work for that (read position)
[23:58:40] <aqeel> increment it every 145 or simply use scrollTo()
[23:58:55] <aqeel> plugin..
[23:59:37] <Needsha> ahhh ty
[23:59:42] <roskel> hi, i have few checkboxes. i have to do an ajax call for each. i have $('.checkbox_class').each(.... do you have any idea how could i do the ajax call only after the current one was finished? i have to do only one call in the same time. default it makes all the calls in the same time. thanks.
