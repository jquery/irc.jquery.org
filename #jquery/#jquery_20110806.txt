[00:00:04] <rhino_> ckb:  how can I have it setfocus, but not highlight the text the default value in the input field?
[00:00:33] <ckb> $(".class form").submit(function() { if (submitted = this) return false; });
[00:01:02] <ckb> wait I forgot a submitted = this; at the bottom
[00:01:12] <ckb> but you get the point, don't forget to replace my = with == :)
[00:01:21] <wkmanire> rhino_: Read this entire page. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL_Tutorial/Focus_and_Selection
[00:03:01] <wkmanire> bricker: It maybe possible to target that one form with its ID. For instance, with ASP. Net forms the IDs are munged by the INamingContainer marker interface. You can still get at the IDs using $( "[id$=myId]" )
[00:03:10] <wkmanire> rather, get at the elements.
[00:03:26] <bricker> ckb: how are you using "this" in that example?
[00:04:09] <ckb> this refers to a DOM element.
[00:04:34] <ckb> $(this) refers to a jQuery element with the size of 1, containing 'this'
[00:04:39] <bricker> ckb: right, but why are you comparing it to "submitted"?
[00:05:04] <ckb> if (submitted == this) return false; submitted = this;
[00:05:16] <bricker> wkmanire: that is over my head I think
[00:05:18] <ckb> nevermind.. go read some tutorials on JS
[00:06:04] <wkmanire> bricker: Well, can you copy and paste the ID from the rendered source?
[00:06:15] <bricker> ckb: yes.
[00:06:15] <wkmanire> from the HTML that goes to the browser.
[00:06:20] <bricker> er
[00:06:22] <bricker> wkmanire: yes
[00:09:07] <bricker> ckb: I understand what 'this' is, but I don't understand why you're checking if submitted (a boolean) is equal to a DOM object
[00:09:40] <ckb> bricker, you can ultimately check to see if the last form submitted was 'this' form or not.
[00:10:04] <bricker> okay, I think I see
[00:10:41] <bricker> it seems like there should be a way to link 'this' to the preventDefault function
[00:10:47] <bricker> but what do I know
[00:10:59] <bricker> or any DOM element, I mean
[00:11:26] <ckb> e.preventDefault(); e is an event, specific to the DOM element e was triggered from.
[00:11:51] <wkmanire> bricker: Although harsh, CKB gave you solid advice about studying. "this" in javascript is arbitrary and it points to different things by default depending on context.
[00:11:54] <ckb> e.g. 'click', 'div#form-id.my-forms', this
[00:12:02] <wkmanire> You can even change what this points to if you want.
[00:12:12] <wkmanire> You have to learn some of javascript's basic nuances.
[00:12:24] <asadpakistani> in my .click() handler when  i return false it doesn't proceed with the link, but if i call a function before returning false and do some dom manipulation in it, then the link follows thru...what is happening here pelase
[00:12:31] <wkmanire> By default jQuery assigns this to the element that triggered the event.
[00:12:31] <bricker> wkmanire: that is what I am trying to do :)
[00:12:36] <bricker> wkmanire: (learn)
[00:12:37] <ckb> you can't jump into diving without learning how to swim.
[00:12:53] <bricker> but you don't learn how to swim by reading a book
[00:13:05] <wkmanire> so if you clicked on an anchor, "this" in the scope of the click handler will point to that anchor.
[00:13:12] <ckb> rioght, you learn by getting thrown in the water and "
[00:13:16] <ckb> "watched over"
[00:13:20] <wkmanire> he he he
[00:13:26] <ckb> not someone teaching you how to flail your arms and legs
[00:13:50] <ckb> ;)
[00:13:53] <bricker> hehe
[00:14:33] <ckb> we're not here to spoon feed you lessons how jquery/javascript. we're here to help with problems the developer's eye can't always see.
[00:15:04] <ckb> if we wanted to teach, we'd go hold classes somewhere and charge :P
[00:15:08] <wkmanire> bah
[00:15:15] <wkmanire> I have beer. I'll entertain a question or two.
[00:15:29] <wkmanire> bricker: You still haven't given me that damned ID.
[00:15:30] <bricker> :) well you're certainly not obligated to help me or anyone else here, but I do appreciate it
[00:16:00] <ckb> In all seriousness. jQuery is not meant for newcomers to javascript.
[00:16:31] <ckb> 'this' is fundamental. </badjoke>
[00:16:33] <bricker> wkmanire: this is the rendered form http://pastie.org/2328970
[00:16:47] <coldhead> ckb: i dispute that remark
[00:16:54] <wkmanire> coldhead: ditto
[00:17:01] <ckb> ?!
[00:17:18] <coldhead> jQuery is ideal at moving cross browser and DOM walking bullshit out of the way so you can focus on learning JS
[00:17:20] <wkmanire> bricker: new_song is being generated by the server?
[00:17:22] <coldhead> it's working for me
[00:17:37] <wkmanire> That doesn't look very munged to me.
[00:17:43] <coldhead> jQuery drags designers to JS :P
[00:18:33] <ckb> coldhead: everywhere I have been, developers have always handled jQuery/markup
[00:18:36] <bricker> wkmanire: yes. Right now all the forms have the same ID (jus because I'm not using the form ID's anywhere so I left it alone), but I can easily make them unique
[00:18:46] <wkmanire> bricker: Well you need to fix that
[00:18:55] <ckb> sigh
[00:18:55] <wkmanire> Your HTML is not valid.
[00:19:04] <wkmanire> Element IDs should be absolutely unique.
[00:19:08] <wkmanire> no matter what
[00:19:15] <bricker> I know that
[00:20:30] <ckb> coldhead: but i you didn't understand variable scoping and 'this' before jumping into jQuery, wouldn't things be a lot more confusing for you?
[00:21:12] <coldhead> i don't think they're LESS confusing without jQuery
[00:22:07] <coldhead> jQuery lets you get stufff done without having to really understand those things
[00:22:19] <coldhead> you can user toggle() and toggleClass() straight up
[00:22:20] <wkmanire> ckb: I think the most harmful thing jQuery does to newcomers is it creates this concept of the magic dollar sign.
[00:22:43] <coldhead> and makes them rampant capitalists?
[00:22:55] <wkmanire> he he he
[00:23:58] <coldhead> i think noobs are better off learning to DO STUFF straight up with something like jqfundamentals
[00:24:09] <coldhead> and learning as much more as they need to from there
[00:24:16] <coldhead> variable hoisting can wait :)
[00:24:27] <wkmanire> People that are inclined to actually learn javascript are going to do it whether or not they start with jQuery. I'm pretty sure there will always be the copy/paste/pray/beg in the IRC type folks, regardless of if they are using jQuery or not.
[00:24:34] <wkmanire> coldhead: Ah, did you read that article int he javascript weekly today?
[00:24:39] <wkmanire> in the*
[00:24:41] <coldhead> not yet!
[00:25:09] <chrisb> hm
[00:26:34] <bricker> well anyways, I just stuck "submitted = false" after if(submitted) and it works as I want it to now.
[00:26:45] <bricker> I appreciate the help and advice
[00:27:26] <wkmanire> ckb: Services was mad at you.
[00:28:49] <ckb> hm
[00:28:57] <ckb> I ghosted my nickname
[00:29:06] <ckb> did it kill the client, or change the nick?
[00:29:16] <wkmanire> (00:25:18) chrisb mudou seu apelido para Guest7963
[00:29:25] <wkmanire> (00:25:25) Guest7963 saiu da sala.
[00:29:32] <wkmanire> (00:26:47) ckb saiu da sala (quit: Disconnected by services).
[00:29:32] <ckb> Um
[00:29:37] <wkmanire> So there you go
[00:31:56] <ckb> ah, there we go
[00:32:50] <ckb> wkmanire: look at this picture
[00:33:00] <wkmanire> hmm?
[00:34:04] <ckb> http://i56.tinypic.com/2n8d73k.png
[00:34:11] <ckb> same request with/without json
[00:34:52] <wkmanire> 801ms for 5kb doesn't seem right.
[00:35:01] <ckb> yeah well
[00:35:06] <ckb> torrents are the cause for that
[00:35:08] <wkmanire> 801ms should be enough time to load all of your markup.
[00:35:11] <ckb> (which is why I disconnected)
[00:35:12] <wkmanire> oh ok.
[00:35:31] <ckb> Transformers 3!
[00:35:55] <wkmanire> bah, thief.
[00:36:01] <wkmanire> Anyway. both ahve mimetype text/html
[00:36:04] <ckb> it's not illegal.
[00:36:13] <wkmanire> I'm assuming the larger ones are actually HTML?
[00:36:18] <coldhead> be an optimus prime, wkmanire, not a negatron
[00:36:29] <ckb> coldhead: haha +1
[00:37:19] <ckb> wkmanire: GET requests are text/html. GET responses can be any mimetype
[00:37:59] <ckb> but yes, the first XHR, is JSON response.
[00:38:43] <ckb> and you just pick the items you want to replace out of the data returned in the callback, and replace the current elements in the DOM with the contextual elements html :)
[00:40:13] <wkmanire> You lost me with contextual elements.
[00:48:45] <Lundy> http://jsfiddle.net/p7S9D/1/ - for some reason I get
[00:48:47] <Lundy> $ is not a function
[00:49:55] <coldhead> ?csb
[00:49:55] <bot-t> cool story, bro. http://i599.photobucket.com/albums/tt71/Pittsburghistan/xb9yt0jpg-1.gif
[00:50:38] <coldhead> you must not be including jQuery, Lundy
[00:50:42] <coldhead> or including it too late
[00:50:50] <coldhead> it works here http://jsfiddle.net/p7S9D/2/
[00:50:58] <coldhead> then it fails because your search thing isn't included
[00:54:15] <snollux_> any recommendations for jquery based music players? jplayer looks interesting, but i'm wondering what else I should check out
[00:58:55] <coldhead> jplayer is just about the only one i see people mention here
[00:59:16] <coldhead> that or using html5 audio
[00:59:22] <Lundy> coldhead: jquery is included :/ just this search isnt working
[00:59:51] <coldhead> $ not being a function may mean something has overriden your $
[00:59:55] <coldhead> for some godawful reason

[02:56:01] <bung> i was wondering if you can go from $('<span/>').text('some text'); to something like $('<span/><em/>').text('some text'); anyone know if that's possible?
[02:56:15] <bung> been trying a few things, no luck yet
[02:57:07] <bricker> bung: try $('span em')
[02:57:37] <bung> that selects all em's in span's... im looking for dynamic creation of something
[02:58:06] <bung> $('<span/><em/>').text('this text is in an em in an span').appendTo('body');
[02:58:21] <bung> should get <body><span><em>this text...</em></span></body>
[02:58:25] <bung> ya know?
[03:01:10] <bricker> so you just want to create the span?
[03:01:21] <bricker> just use .append and type it in there
[03:01:54] <bricker> $('parent_element').append('<span><em>text</em></span>');
[03:04:06] <bricker> now I have a question: the var i = 1; line is preventing the page from loading. Anybody have an idea why http://pastie.org/2329417
[03:04:59] <bung> nah it needs to be dynamic
[03:05:54] <bung> var someWrapper = '<div/><p/>'; $(someWrapper).text('some text');
[03:06:10] <bung> no worries if it cant be done, im just curious
[03:06:18] <bung> it'd be a nice feature to have, but will work otherwise
[03:10:07] <bricker> bung: I don't understand what you are trying to do
[03:25:14] <dabear> bung: something like this ? http://jsfiddle.net/tq3tM/

[03:41:17] <jaypitidi> How can I get IE to return the last character in a string, seems substr(-1) returns the whole string only in IE
[04:11:41] <austen> jaypitidi: try substr(-1,1), which should still work on other browsers as well.
[04:13:11] <jaypitidi> well I'm using slice(-1) which seems to work, but now my problem is if the variable I need is the last two digits. I'm trying to figure out an if statement without having to declare another variable
[04:46:23] <H00ka> hey, i have a little problem with the progressbar to restart after "interval_2" -> http://pastebin.com/4XBM1C6p
[05:08:50] <Hemebond> I have a jQueryUI problem I can't debug. I am checking a radio button in a buttonset, then calling refresh. It's not working the first time, but works find when I do it manually.
[05:12:35] <Hemebond> Oh. It works if I only have one of my objects there.
[05:12:43] <dropMAU5> I want to load images via ajax all nice and easy... Is there a jquery way? Or just ajax and display response <IMG> tag? or replace the src? what's proper?
[05:12:43] <Hemebond> ffff
[05:17:40] <Hemebond> omfg I'm an idiot.
[05:29:32] <dropMAU5> hey, shouldn't be any problems trying ajax in jsfiddle?
[05:30:09] <Aamir> dropMAU5:  http://gyazo.com/9a836a7cca9ae262fdcbb8c7cb8157e7.png
[05:31:24] <dropMAU5> thanks, duh- of course the ajax isn't going to wortk on jsfiddle
[05:31:31] <dropMAU5> i need some coffee ;)
[05:32:02] <Aamir> dropMAU5:  u don't need coffee. ajax works on jsfiddle :P
[05:32:29] <dropMAU5> yeah, I'm sitting here trying to cross domain stuff not even thinking about it
[05:32:49] <Aamir> thats the point :P
[05:32:57] <dropMAU5> ;P
[05:34:17] <dropMAU5> pass the cream please... now- back to my question from earlier- When loading resources like IMG's / applets / bin stuff.... is there a best practice? or is it simple $.get()?
[05:42:46] <formers> hi, how would you change the size of a text box based on the length of the text entered ?
[05:46:32] <dropMAU5> formers maybe, have you tried setting the font in pixels, calculate the padding... should be close enough... esp if it's a short string
[05:48:10] <formers> dropMAU5: Are you saying setting the font in pixels and then counting the number of chars and multiplying it by the pixels ?
[05:48:41] <dropMAU5> include any padding and use a font like courier? but thats all hacky?
[05:49:57] <formers> why courier ?
[05:56:53] <dropMAU5> formers, every character is the same width
[05:57:26] <formers> ahh right
[05:58:25] <dropMAU5> so lets say i know every char is 10 pixels wide, and theres about 6pixels of padding around the side, i could set the width as value.length*10+6...\
[06:08:27] <formers> ok thanks dropMAU5
[06:15:21] <kurisu> how can I pull an int from a class/id??? im using somevar=$('#someclass').attr("class")  but im getting a string ("13") instead of an int
[06:15:54] <kurisu> i tried parseInt but got the same... any ideas??
[06:18:31] <kiran> good morning
[06:18:56] <jaypitidi> if you know what position the int is in you could use slice or substr
[06:19:52] <kiran> I am doing ajax post to submit a form - everything works well and my backend return json.  But for some reason that json file gets downloaded and displayed, instead of passing that data to the handler
[06:19:54] <kiran> any elp?
[06:20:08] <jaypitidi> if ($q.length > 2) { var $q_id = $q.substr(1,2) } else { var $q_id = $q.substr(1); }
[06:22:08] <jaypitidi> I have 3 functions doing the same thing except they are targeting different classes, each class performs a different animation. How can I consolidate it into one function?
[06:23:01] <jaypitidi> http://pastebin.com/73phEpBQ
[06:24:19] <dropMAU5> might want to DRY that out ;)
[06:24:48] <jaypitidi> i don't get it
[06:26:58] <kurisu> hmm I'll try it. thought there would be an easier way though....  I'm setting the class to an int in php so I just wanted to convert str to int
[06:27:32] <kurisu> *** + in js / jquery
[06:27:56] <zim> Hi all. If I have <div id="foo" data-a="1" data-b="2" data-c="3"> is there a way to read all three into an array with .data ie var data-array = $('#foo').data(*);
[06:28:49] <zim> hope that makes sense?
[06:29:41] <kiran> I am doing ajax post to submit a form - everything works well and my backend return json.  But for some reason that json file gets downloaded and displayed, instead of passing that data to the handler
[06:29:44] <kiran> anyone?
[06:31:07] <zim> kiran: pastbin the code looks like you are not setting json in your type
[06:31:53] <zim> kiran: are you using post?

[07:30:03] <fedora_newb> Anyone know how to make a parent li link menu item in 'hover' state while on a submenu of ul?
[07:31:31] <jonee> fedora_newb, try this http://www.darrenkrape.com/css-drop-down-menus-2
[07:44:57] <Guest21213> http://jsfiddle.net/uTnA6/ is this code correct?
[07:49:07] <Anna``> no one there ?
[07:49:10] <Anna``> http://jsfiddle.net/uTnA6/2/
[07:51:45] <Jayflux> Anna`` you can't do that
[07:52:24] <Anna``> whats wrong with this Jayflux ?
[07:53:03] <Jayflux> you don't need to put script tags in the javascript window Anna``
[07:53:05] <Jayflux> http://jsfiddle.net/jayflux/uTnA6/3/
[07:56:39] <fedora_newb> jonee, http://pastebin.com/Hist9412 ... it works with this only when i hover over the sub menu, then hop off it and then back on it...it doesn't work immediately...maybe i did something screwy
[07:59:04] <Anna``> ok Jayflux : but in html i can write script tags this way?
[07:59:15] <Jayflux> yep
[08:04:22] <bfred> how do I imitate .slideDown() with .animate() ?
[08:10:00] <bfred> .animate({'height':'show'})
[08:22:41] <rookfood> I expect a css3 hover transition animations to work when I trigger an event like .mouseenter() on the element with the transition/animation, but it isn't working
[09:10:28] <Hemebond> Does jQuery hide errors?
[09:10:55] <H00ka> what kind of errors
[09:11:42] <Hemebond> Really bad ones. Like calling a method that doesn't exist.
[09:12:12] <H00ka> do you know firebug (firefox extention) ?
[09:12:46] <Hemebond> Yes, I am currently using it. It doesn't show the error. The script just stops.
[09:12:46] <H00ka> JS is called in your browser, so you need to check your browser console
[09:13:03] <Hemebond> Neither the console, nor Firebug show an error.
[09:13:45] <Hemebond> Unless I put it outside of the jQuery.ready() business.
[09:14:39] <Hemebond> Oh wait, it throws there too.  Hmm. Most of my code starts from the call-back to getJSON.
[09:16:10] <Hemebond> Right, when I call a non-existent function from within the anonymous getJSON call-back function I see no error. The script just stops.
[09:33:02] <Hemebond> Ha! jQuery.getJSON was eating the TypeError being raised.
[09:33:18] <Hemebond> But a Try Catch in the anon function allows me to see it.
[09:33:59] <|splat|> i'm trying to make a simple contact form with validation using jquery and jquery ui (for the button style) and I can't figure out why the js isn't picking up the button press http://jsfiddle.net/sweetbrett/FDKDj/
[09:34:13] <|splat|> i've tried using click() also, but no luck
[09:36:45] <ailaG> Hi.. I think I'm missing something, if I include jquery mobile, jquery commands stop working (e.g. $(foo).hide()). I've got a wrapping div with role=page and one with role=content.
[09:37:30] <ailaG> oh yeah, they only stop working on the mobile. they work on the computer just fine.

[09:46:25] <StephenS> hey hi
[09:46:27] <StephenS> how are you doin?
[09:47:18] <sshaginyan> Hey is there a way I can make the user choose from the list of autocomplete options instead of what he's typing in the input box. So after he types the "S" in "Steven" bunch of names pop up but he must choose the final result from the list
[09:48:25] <sshaginyan> Here is the website http://www.bunchlink.com/enw/ and the input box is "city or zip"
[09:49:26] <sshaginyan> I know there is a option in auto complete something like mustMatch: True but you can search two ways in "city or zip"
[09:50:56] <sshaginyan> Anyone out there?
[09:51:33] <Hemebond> Ha. And it only swallows the exceptions if I have Adblock enabled. What on earth?
[09:53:51] <sshaginyan> ?
[09:55:03] <Hemebond> sshaginyan: Firefox + Adblock + jQuery == No exceptions shown in the error console. They all get swallowed.
[09:56:23] <sshaginyan> Hemebond: I don't know what your trying to tell me
[09:56:43] <Hemebond> sshaginyan: You said "?", so I thought you wanted to know what I was on about.
[09:57:01] <sshaginyan> oh
[09:57:34] <sshaginyan> sorry wasn't reading. Yes, yes it does
[09:57:44] <sshaginyan> and?
[09:57:57] <Hemebond> And... it should show the errors.
[09:58:09] <Hemebond> If you disable Adblock it all works fine.
[09:58:31] <sshaginyan> So disable it
[09:59:01] <sshaginyan> Are you trying to catch a bug?
[09:59:09] <Hemebond> Well... that's not really the point. I was trying to figure out why the exceptions weren't showing. I tracked it down.
[09:59:37] <htoothrot> i have all those extensions and i don't think i've had that problem
[10:00:14] <Hemebond> htoothrot: ajax call-back functions will eat the exceptions.
[10:00:24] <htoothrot> oh, gotcha
[10:00:41] <dualcore> is there a freenode channel for like unified field theory?
[10:00:47] <Hemebond> htoothrot: And most of my code just happens to originate from an ajax callback :-(
[10:01:03] <Hemebond> htoothrot: It has been a painful 2 weeks trying to debug code without exceptions.
[10:01:27] <dgm> Hi folks.  I think I've found a bug:  when looking at the demo at http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#placeholder â€¦ after scrambling the sortables a few times, I can end up with a DOM order that does not match the screen, using firebug to look at the DOM sometimes the last item in the DOM is actually up around #3 position.
[10:04:15] <VictorCL2> is there a way on $.ajax   data:  to pass all the inputs on the form automatically ?
[10:04:42] <sshaginyan> VictorCL2: What do you mean automatically?
[10:06:10] <VictorCL2> I have $.ajax({ url.php,type:post,data:data...... bla bla ... so in data I have to pass all the data as variable=value&variable=value  ... but is there a way to make the data it send to the url be all the inputs from a form?
[10:13:09] <|splat|> http://jsfiddle.net/sweetbrett/FDKDj/  ok got a little further but for some reason my $("#email_error").html('Please include a return address').fadeToggle('slow'); and similar lines aren't working
[10:14:47] <|splat|> is this because of the $('.error').hide(); at the start of my script?  can i not show a specific id that was hidden by class before?
[10:32:13] <TrueColors> http://83.100.239.111/projects/HSN/ what why how, click them slowly and it'll look nice. But click them fast.. and well..
[10:32:24] <TrueColors> you'll see the next one tries to load underneath
[10:32:35] <TrueColors> like.. if you load on What, then you click why then how quickly. you'll see what i mean.
[10:32:37] <TrueColors> how can I fix that?
[10:33:04] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/2vqQ3/ thats got my js on
[10:35:38] <cedrichurst> hello allâ€¦ i'd like to use jq templates but store the external template content externally in seperate .tmp files a la: http://encosia.com/using-external-templates-with-jquery-templates/.  however, i'm wondering if there's a way to intern the template content during minification
[10:35:47] <cedrichurst> similar to what dojo shrinksafe does
[10:35:53] * StevenBlack TrueColors: Animations queue-up.  Use .stop() to terminate animations before inducing a new one.
[10:35:55] <cedrichurst> does anyone have a suggestion?
[10:36:25] <TrueColors> Where would I use .stop(), I did try place it in... but it didn't really make any difference so maybe I put it in the wrong places.
[10:36:48] <TrueColors> I was doing.. .stop().fadeIn(400) and .stop().fadeOut(400)
[10:36:59] * StevenBlack cedrichurst:  Have you tried this?  I use yui minification and templates are no problem...
[10:37:46] * StevenBlack TrueColors: http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[10:38:27] * StevenBlack I'm guessing that passing a parameter may help you.
[10:38:29] <cedrichurst> StevenBlack: no i haven't, i'll check it out
[10:39:19] <cedrichurst> curious to see how it detects references to the static templates, though
[10:40:16] * StevenBlack cedrichurst: labels and text don't minify so you'll be find.
[10:40:39] <TrueColors> Ok, StevenBlack
[10:40:40] <TrueColors> I did..
[10:40:41] <TrueColors> $('#homepage_tabs_content > :not(#randMembers)').stop(true).fadeOut(400);
[10:40:56] <TrueColors> but if you do it for like... 6 times in a row (changing the tabs) quickly.
[10:40:59] <TrueColors> the text will eventually fade
[10:41:20] <wirehack7> stuoid question: $(this +' > img').remove(); how to change this that the img will be removed?
[10:41:33] <cedrichurst> StevenBlack: let me clarify what i'm trying to do
[10:41:35] <wirehack7> *stupid
[10:41:38] <TrueColors> it'll go grey then eventually will go white.
[10:41:43] <cedrichurst> in dojo, you can reference a template as an external file
[10:41:50] <snover> ?faq @ wirehack7
[10:41:54] <cedrichurst> so i can have, for example, WidgetView.html
[10:42:03] <wirehack7> ah got it: $(this).find('img').remove();
[10:42:04] <wirehack7> thanks
[10:42:11] <cedrichurst> and then reference this file as the source of my template in my js code
[10:42:47] <cedrichurst> by default, when i'm in development mode, i can make changes to the WidgetView.html file and it will be refreshed on the client side as the template is loaded each time as an xhr call
[10:43:02] <cedrichurst> but, when i'm ready to go to production, dojo shrinksafe will find references to static content like templates
[10:43:15] <cedrichurst> and "intern" their content inside the js
[10:43:16] <TrueColors> looking at hte source, opacity ends up being 0.
[10:43:20] <TrueColors> so i think i can use css to change that
[10:43:29] <cedrichurst> so the WidgetView.html goes away in the production build
[10:43:37] <cedrichurst> and its contents are injected directly into the js
[10:44:28] <cedrichurst> this works quite nicely for the dojo templating stuffâ€¦ but i'm trying to determine if jquery templates has a similar capability which yuicompressor/google clousure/jsmin, etc
[10:44:42] <TrueColors> that works
[10:45:29] <cedrichurst> here's some info on how it works in dojo, for reference: http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/dijit/_Templated.html
[10:45:29] * StevenBlack cedrichurst:  Try it; there won't be any issue.
[10:45:40] <sshaginyan> Hey is there a way I can make the user choose from the list of autocomplete options instead of what he's typing in the input box. So after he types the "S" in "Steven" bunch of names pop up but he must choose the final result from the list
[10:45:41] <sshaginyan> Here is the website http://www.bunchlink.com/enw/ and the input box is "city or zip"
[10:45:41] <sshaginyan> I know there is a option in auto complete something like mustMatch: True but you can search two ways in "city or zip"
[10:46:05] <cedrichurst> StevenBlack: cool, i'll give it a shot
[10:50:06] <sshaginyan> wow dead silence.... was it something I said?
[10:57:15] <sshaginyan> Anyone?
[11:50:10] <thebignoise> how would i go about getting the width of string of text.
[11:50:29] <thebignoise> i have a box that hold dynamic text and i want to scale the text if it is to large for the static box which holds it
[11:50:57] <thebignoise> any ideas?
[12:02:27] <doubleJ> Hello...I'm working with width(), trying to get the width minus a certain value.  Can a calculation be done with width()?
[12:02:40] <thebignoise> yea
[12:03:55] <Vaerros> doubleJ: yes, but supported is limited
[12:04:41] <doubleJ> is it just width()-100 or something?  I tried that and width(-100) and wasn't seeming to work.
[12:08:03] <austen> I have an interesting problem: I have an animated menu that extends off the edge of the screen with overflow set to hidden. However, there are form elements in the menu and the tab index is causing the entire menu block to shift into view. How can I disable the tab index to prevent the hoirzontal scroll revealing my overflow?
[12:25:29] <austen> Got it: set tabindex to -1...

[13:16:15] <ximarin> hi all, question: is it possible to apply the UIs ui-corner-whatever to the th of a table?
[13:27:45] <zi> Has anyone had problems .submit()ting forms? I have a bound a function that returns false first time, and true second time. Problem's that it doesn't actually submit it the second time.
[13:35:34] <bregoldae> anyone using JRAC?
[13:44:07] <sasori> hi, am reading a book, and the sample for .animate() thing sometimes shows the attributes are  enclosed in single quotes, sometimes not, which is correct ?
[13:44:54] <VeXii> bouth are legale in JS
[13:45:02] <gnoirzox> both*
[13:45:14] <VeXii> thanks
[13:45:22] <whomp> if use a post in JQUERY as such: $.post("URL/plusStream.php",{"id":id}, function(html){});   where id is, say, '32', and then i call it in php using $PID=$_POST["id"]);  what will $PID evaluate to? '32'? "32"?
[13:45:34] <sasori> ok thanks
[13:46:31] <VeXii> dont ppl do type casts for you? so 32 and "32" is the same most of the time?
[13:47:57] <whomp> i dunno, but then i call UPDATE ... WHERE PID=$PID in mysql
[13:48:07] <whomp> and it never seems to work
[13:48:30] <whomp> so im afraid its something like "'32'"
[13:48:44] <VeXii> try and echo it out before you hit the sql
[13:48:50] <VeXii> or set up a test or somthing
[13:49:08] <whomp> i try, but how do i do that in a post call? when i use echo, nothing is printed to the screen
[13:49:51] <VeXii> if not ...WHERE PID=".(int)$PID."....
[13:50:22] <ximarin> if its not printed out, it does not get posted
[13:50:52] <ximarin> try using firebug and take a look at the parameters when submitting the post-value
[13:52:44] <ximarin> and try to echo smth like echo('#'.$_POST["id"].'#'); to see if at least the ## gets echoed, then you know the post isnt working correctly
[13:53:23] <VeXii> or use var_dump :)
[13:54:54] <sasori> am currently playing with the animate(), how to make the p:first thing appear again at the place of origin and do the same actioni all over again? http://pastebin.com/asd1DEcb
[13:57:42] <VeXii> sounds like youre trying to make a copy scroll out from the first p tag?
[13:58:06] <VeXii> cant you make a clone of the P and animate on that then?
[13:58:25] <sasori> how to clone?
[13:59:28] <whomp> ok i installed firebug, how can i use to track a post?
[13:59:49] <VeXii> look in the "net" tab
[14:00:21] <VeXii>  sasori thers .clone
[14:01:49] <sasori> VeXii: am sorry but, what do you mean by "net" tab ? is that the online jquery manual?
[14:02:21] <VeXii> sorry sasori it where to whomp

[14:20:16] <Danielss89> Hi
[14:20:29] <Danielss89> are there any known bugs with height() in chrome?
[14:20:35] <VeXii> whomp: and youre id variable is set?
[14:21:09] <whomp> well in the example call i posted, it is set as 28
[14:21:14] <Danielss89> take a look here: http://frisr.dk/calendar <-- i log height() for #bar and it logs 160, but it is set to 53 and the computed style is 53..
[14:21:15] <whomp> ive also tried '28'
[14:21:52] <VeXii> i dont think youre sending all the data up to the server
[14:22:17] <whomp> how do i do that
[14:23:23] <VeXii> ohh w8 youre sending it a JSON
[14:23:54] <VeXii> try json_decode up on youre server
[14:26:29] <whomp> so i say $PID = json_decode=($_POST["id"]); ?
[14:26:34] <whomp> o wow
[14:26:37] <whomp> no i dont lol
[14:26:48] <whomp> $PID = json_decode($_POST["id"]);
[14:26:51] <whomp> that?
[14:29:33] <VeXii> try it
[14:31:10] <whomp> ahh deed
[14:31:17] <whomp> it did not work :(
[14:31:39] <Danielss89> whoopsâ€¦ did anyone answer?
[14:32:33] <whomp> if it helps, here is my php: http://pastebin.com/kUEUPEK9
[14:35:29] <VeXii> and how to you fire off the event?
[14:35:33] <VeXii> whith the tag onClick?
[14:36:19] <Zenger> Hi , can i trigger a key combination like CTRL + S , or SHIFT + Enter using the $('object').trigger(); ???
[14:36:37] <whomp> yeah, with onClick
[14:36:48] <whomp> i can tell the function is running because all the alerts show up
[14:37:10] <klj613> ajpiano: so instead of injecting the HTML in with js, I should have it in by default and use css to display/hide accordingly? thing is, i'm trying to keep all the front-end (javascript) templates seperate from the backend.
[14:37:12] <VeXii> and jPlayer starts?
[14:38:09] <dabear> i know that some code *somewhere* in the page is stealing the focus
[14:38:18] <dabear> how can I determine where that code is?
[14:38:49] <VeXii> you can return focus whith the blur event
[14:39:09] <whomp> yeah the jPlayer goes ham
[14:40:09] <VeXii> didnt you forget to escape the URL variable in $.POST?
[14:40:30] <VeXii> its $.post("URL/plusStream.php",{"id":id}, function(html){});
[14:40:40] <VeXii> try whith $.post(URL+"/plusStream.php",{"id":id}, function(html){});
[14:40:59] <whomp> oh URL is just a placeholder
[14:41:05] <whomp> wait
[14:41:08] <whomp> hmm
[14:41:38] <whomp> yeah i call the full URL without any concatenation
[14:41:48] <whomp> or variable usage
[14:41:51] <orbital_fox> does Draggable and Droppable keep and "internal" registry of the object they have been assigned?
[14:41:55] <Danielss89> take a look here: http://frisr.dk/calendar <-- i log height() for #bar and it logs 160, but it is set to 53 and the computed style is 53..
[14:42:19] <orbital_fox> or does just adding the classes ui-droppable and ui-draggable make them so?
[14:43:42] <VeXii> so you hit the server whith that url?
[14:46:37] <whomp> yeah
[14:46:41] <whomp> i hit it and quit it
[14:47:14] <whomp> and any mySQL updates that DONT need the posted variable execute fine
[14:48:07] <VeXii> okay and you didnt see anything in firebug > net > the event's post data tab?
[14:51:27] <whomp> heres the output
[14:51:27] <whomp> http://pastebin.com/fxsZShRX
[14:51:33] <whomp> (i dont believe so though)
[14:52:54] <VeXii> thats @only@ the headers i think
[14:53:12] <VeXii> cant see firebug here as im on my roommates computer atm
[14:53:46] <VeXii> but above that out put and below the net tab there shod be som extra tabs. one saying post or data or the like
[14:54:03] <whomp> brb 10 min
[14:54:27] <lenswipe> hey folks
[14:54:35] <lenswipe> anyone know how to zebra stripe a p tag?
[14:55:37] <VeXii> wrap each lette in a span tag? xD
[14:56:12] <lenswipe> VeXii, that stripes each letter
[14:56:50] <VeXii> naaah use 2 types of span tags. one white on black?
[14:56:51] <lenswipe> VeXii, thats not what i wanted
[14:56:55] <lenswipe> hmm
[14:57:11] <lenswipe> problem is the newlines are being auto generated by highlight_code() so i cant control how the lines are done
[14:58:17] <VeXii> ahh youre talking about each line (where thinking chars)
[15:00:26] <VeXii> but is each line 1 p tag or do you get all the highlighted code in 1 tag soup?
[15:02:34] <uptownben> Hey all.
[15:03:24] <lenswipe> VeXii, highlight_code is returning tag soup
[15:03:44] <uptownben> What is the XML equivalent of .html()? I tried .text(), but that returns all the text data of all child nodes also, I want the text data for just the one node and not its children
[15:04:46] <VeXii> lenswipe can see sample? :>
[15:05:07] <lenswipe> VeXii, sure
[15:06:01] <lenswipe> VeXii, 95.146.89.252/resume/code
[15:06:48] <lenswipe> VeXii, http://pastebin.com/dxrWxzFE
[15:07:04] <VeXii> lokking
[15:08:36] <VeXii> cant you split it up at each <br/> and then resort it in to a OL or somthing (sound like a nasty hack'n wack)
[15:08:59] <lenswipe> VeXii, not without a really hacky regex and strtok()
[15:10:51] <VeXii> if you loop it in to a div and pull the textContext? dont it keeps youre code somwhat formated and you can look after \n or somthing?
[15:13:06] <sshaginyan> Hey is there a way I can make the user choose from the list of autocomplete options instead of what he's typing in the input box. So after he types the "S" in "Steven" bunch of names pop up but he must choose the final result from the list
[15:13:07] <sshaginyan> Here is the website http://www.bunchlink.com/enw/ and the input box is "city or zip"
[15:13:07] <sshaginyan> I know there is a option in auto complete something like mustMatch: True but you can search two ways in "city or zip"
[15:17:03] <whomp> ok sorry about that
[15:17:06] <whomp> ill check firebug
[15:18:23] <VeXii> tell us what you find out :)
[15:18:43] <sshaginyan> Anyone?
[15:19:34] <lenswipe> sshaginyan, i belive thats called "AJAX" might wana look that up :)
[15:19:35] <bregoldae> anyone using jrac/
[15:20:01] <sshaginyan> lenswipe: Your very cute
[15:20:05] <lenswipe> O_O
[15:20:09] <lenswipe> sshaginyan, come again?
[15:20:10] <sshaginyan> Seriously anyone?
[15:20:35] <sshaginyan> lenswipe: If your gana help me then help me. Don't be ironic
[15:20:41] <lenswipe> sshaginyan, im not being ironic
[15:20:41] <sshaginyan> I know what ajax is
[15:20:49] <lenswipe> sshaginyan, i thought you were trying to do it solely with jquery
[15:20:55] <lenswipe> sorry
[15:21:02] <bung> anyone know if its possible to dynamically create nested dom objects using the whole $('<tag/>') format.... ie. $('<span/><em/>').text('hi'); gives <span><em>hi</em></span> ... again it could be any string of nodes used
[15:21:29] <sshaginyan> lenswipe: I'm trying to get someone to particularly click on the list that autocomplete generates
[15:21:42] <lenswipe> sshaginyan, ah
[15:21:55] <sshaginyan> lenswipe: I know there is a useMatch option
[15:22:09] <sshaginyan> but that's not what I want cause I have 2 hings they can search
[15:22:34] <lenswipe> ah right
[15:22:37] <lenswipe> im lost then sorry
[15:24:07] <sshaginyan> lenswipe: np
[15:24:32] <sshaginyan> lenswipe: I've been asking this question from morning and no one seems to know how to do it
[15:24:38] <sshaginyan> oh well
[15:24:49] <lenswipe> hmm
[15:25:16] <VeXii> you wanner make sure after the first letter the use cant enter more text but only select a option from the dropdown?
[15:25:53] <sshaginyan> VeXii: No let them enter more text, but at the end let them select it from the drop down options
[15:26:24] <sshaginyan> So even if they typed what they where looking for correctly, at the end let them choose it from the drop down options
[15:26:30] <VeXii> so just disable the standart submit and only fire it from the dropdown's click?
[15:26:44] <whomp> hmm, well im in firebug 1.7.3 on FF3.6, and i i see 3 tabs: headers, response ,and html. should there be another where i can see the post data?
[15:27:31] <sshaginyan> VeXii: here is the site http://www.bunchlink.com/enw/ type something in City or Zip
[15:27:42] <sshaginyan> VeXii: You will see what I'm talking about
[15:29:05] <mikaelbrevik> sshaginyan: How about re-focusing on blur if no element is selected? Might be a bit ugly, though
[15:29:39] <sshaginyan> mikaelbrevik: Can you please give me an example
[15:30:12] <mikaelbrevik> 2 sec. JSFiddle on the way
[15:30:20] <VeXii> i cant see the diff from the demo, i must be lokking at it wrong :/
[15:30:57] <sshaginyan> VeXii: Are what demo? The site?
[15:31:09] <VeXii> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[15:31:23] <VeXii> sry if you where rolling one youre self
[15:31:47] <whomp> yo VeXii, where'd you say i can find the POST data?
[15:31:50] <sshaginyan> VeXii: No I'm not I'm using jquery-ui autocomplete
[15:34:29] <Aric> I'm trying to loop through some JSON data and nothing is showing on my Google Map:
[15:34:30] <Aric> http://pastie.org/2331876
[15:36:47] <mikaelbrevik> sshaginyan: I thought something like this might have worked: http://jsfiddle.net/FA3JX/
[15:37:24] <mikaelbrevik> But seems as focus don't do the trick. At least not in Safari 5.0.1
[15:38:36] <mikaelbrevik> And deactivate submit etc
[15:38:52] <sshaginyan> I see
[15:40:29] <sshaginyan> mikaelbrevik: Thanks so much mate, just gave me an idea
[15:41:00] <mikaelbrevik> Glad to be of assistance!
[15:45:17] <treefinguy> hey I'm trying to assign an event to a checkbox being checked, but since the checkbox is the target of a label and hidden nothing I do is picking up the change event (unless I do blur, but by the time it loses focus it's too late)
[15:45:20] <Aric> I tried changing the JSON result to have labels.. still not working.. anyone can help?
[15:45:20] <Aric> http://pastie.org/2331915
[15:45:21] <treefinguy> can anyone help me with that
[15:46:44] <mikaelbrevik> treefinguy: A JSFiddle would help describe the problem
[15:47:24] <treefinguy> ok mikaelbrevik but I think I just found a solution, focus event and the function can then drop focus
[15:47:33] <treefinguy> I'll try that first
[15:48:27] <treefinguy> dang, is there a way to tell it to drop focus
[15:48:55] <mikaelb> Like blur?
[15:49:19] <treefinguy> not quite, it works properly now if I have the event fire on focus, but then I need it to drop focus from that element
[15:49:38] <treefinguy> so the focus is on something else or nothing
[15:50:56] <treefinguy> ah can I just do $(someSelector).focus()?
[15:51:05] <mikaelb> Aric: You need to try debugging. ie. console.log() on data[index[1]]
[15:51:29] <mikaelb> treefinguy: Yes. $(someSelector).focus() will give element focus, $(someSelector).blur() will drop focus
[15:51:50] <treefinguy> ah perfect, I forgot about using blur without passing anything
[15:51:51] <treefinguy> thanks very much
[15:52:02] <mikaelb> Np
[15:55:53] <treefinguy> actually mikaelb that didn't work
[15:56:11] <treefinguy> neither did $(selector).focus()
[15:56:26] <treefinguy> should I jsfiddle the thing
[15:56:52] <danieliser> Ìû
[15:57:09] <mikaelb> Yes, fiddle it
[15:58:42] <treefinguy> uh, do I need to put in script tags and the link to the jquery lib in jsfiddle
[15:59:16] <mikaelb> No. Not if you use the dedicated script text area
[15:59:37] <mikaelb> But you have to select jQuery as a library on the left hand side
[15:59:41] <treefinguy> k
[16:02:24] <treefinguy> may I query you mikaelb
[16:02:33] <mikaelb> Sure
[16:10:22] <Aric> What would be the correct way to loop through the JSON data here?

[16:44:43] <whomp> i used a packet sniffer and got some info
[16:45:23] <VeXii> you did? :D
[16:46:44] <whomp> yes
[16:46:57] <VeXii>  show show
[16:47:23] <whomp> i have a packet labeled "OPTIONS /plusStream.php HTTP1.1"
[16:47:26] <whomp> in wireshark
[16:49:01] <VeXii> but stil no data?
[16:49:25] <donCams> noob question. if you have a big enough project. is it better to write your scripts as jQuery plugins?
[16:49:38] <whomp> this is the pastebin: http://pastebin.com/Y407HRui
[16:49:56] <whomp> i have no idea what a post packet is supposed to look like, but it appears to have no data
[16:50:43] <whomp> although the datas on the server right? because its calling a function with the hardcoded value 28 being passed to the PHP
[16:52:31] <VeXii> a hardcoded value?
[16:52:55] <austinbv> anyone have any experience with the canvas and jasmine?
[16:53:10] <VeXii> sorry i have to give it a look tomorrow when im on a real computer :p
[16:53:13] <VeXii> GN ppl
[16:54:13] <whomp> night thx for help
[16:58:38] <bregoldae> Hey there, anyone using JRAC?
[17:06:49] <hello44> hi all. does anyone know a plugin that will allow a user to mark a link on my site for later browsing? so they can build up a shopping card so to speak... just for links of interest
[17:10:47] <dyjytyl> I'm trying to submit a form by assigning a variable to become the form id so it's like this: $(form_name).submit(); but it's not submitting the form
[17:10:48] <dyjytyl> is that wrong?
[17:10:56] <imsky> yes
[17:11:52] <dyjytyl> ..so what's the right way to do it?
[17:12:18] <imsky> $("#"+form_name").submit()
[17:12:26] <dyjytyl> doh
[17:12:33] <dyjytyl> retarded moment
[17:12:47] <dyjytyl> technically that's not correct imsky, but i get the idea ;)
[17:13:00] <imsky> ok
[17:13:11] <dyjytyl> thanks
[17:13:34] <imsky> sure
[17:15:49] <saschagehlich> hey folks, is there a way to fetch errors as a getJSON call fails?
[17:18:14] <coldhead> you mean other than with the error handler function, saschagehlich?
[17:18:19] <bobbobbins> hey, two quick questions. 1) whats the jquery plugin that will make an image float down the screen with you?
[17:18:36] <saschagehlich> is there an error handler function? maybe I just don't remember the documentation correctly
[17:18:44] <coldhead> css: position:fixed, bobbobbins
[17:18:56] <whomp> i make a call in jquery:  $.post("http://www.freshnewtracks.com/feedback/plusStream.php",{"id":id}, function(html){}); to a php file, but the php file doesn't seem to be recieving "id". if it helps here is the REQUEST packet, which doesn't seem to have any data (should it?) http://pastebin.com/vy3k9Jvi
[17:19:10] <bobbobbins> really? just position:fixed?
[17:19:17] <coldhead> you're right, saschagehlich, getJSON doesn't seemt to take  one
[17:19:29] <imsky> whomp: make sure the id variable actually has a value
[17:19:36] <coldhead> saschagehlich: use ?ajax // with the JSON datatype
[17:19:36] <bot-t> saschagehlich, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[17:19:46] <saschagehlich> coldhead: it does, just call .error(callback) to the object returned by .getJSON()
[17:19:54] <bobbobbins> but i want it to stay within a certain div? so only go to a point, then stop
[17:20:00] <coldhead> oh neato
[17:20:13] <coldhead> sorry saschagehlich, it's my first day using jQuery
[17:20:22] <saschagehlich> np ;)
[17:20:35] <Trisox[work]> :P
[17:22:42] <Trisox> damn mosquito's
[17:22:43] <bregoldae> I'm using JRAC to resize and crop an image with PHP, its cropping just fine except it isn't scalingâ€¦ I'm sure I am just forgetting to pass something in somewhere, thoughts?
[17:23:22] <whomp> imsky, yeah ive tried passing in '28' and 28
[17:24:19] <imsky> whomp: is your domain freshnewtracks.com?
[17:26:19] <saschagehlich> well, looks like $.getJSON().error() is not being called on a 500
[17:28:48] <donCams> whomp, can you please pastebin.com your jquery and php code?
[17:30:10] <coldhead> and success is?
[17:35:05] <whomp> jquery code: http://pastebin.com/Fnzbharj
[17:36:39] <whomp> php code: http://pastebin.com/G5A2Ec1e
[17:39:19] <saschagehlich> coldhead: success is http code 200
[17:40:23] <coldhead> saschagehlich: i mean "and the success handler is run (on 500)?"
[17:40:33] <donCams> whomp, no need to json decode
[17:40:43] <donCams> just $_POST['id'];
[17:40:43] <saschagehlich> coldhead: no, nothing is run. I just see an error in my error console and that's it
[17:41:14] <Trisox[work]> pff
[17:41:17] <coldhead> saschagehlich: try ajax() instead of getJSON, see if that gives you more to play with
[17:41:19] <Trisox[work]> stupic mac
[17:41:29] <Trisox[work]> :@
[17:41:30] <whomp> yeah i tried that
[17:41:51] <donCams> then?
[17:42:49] <whomp> it fails equally spectacularly
[17:43:36] <saschagehlich> Trisox[work]: don't say that.
[17:43:53] <Trisox[work]> wel i'm in the install menu of lion
[17:44:00] <Trisox[work]> and i got no mouse @ this moment
[17:44:08] <Trisox[work]> how do i get in the top menu
[17:44:09] <Trisox[work]> tell me
[17:44:11] <Trisox[work]> plzzz
[17:46:16] <whomp> do you have some other suggestions? like for why the REQUEST would be blank? or is it supposed to be that way?
[17:47:49] <donCams> are you passing the id on the function?
[17:48:03] <donCams> and are you actually getting the id from the input?
[17:48:32] <Trisox[work]> saschagehlich well?
[17:49:08] <saschagehlich> sry didn't read
[17:49:17] <saschagehlich> erm with your touch pad?
[17:49:32] <saschagehlich> or plug in your usb mouse? the installation has the basic usb drivers loaded
[17:49:44] <saschagehlich> even bluetooth should work while installing lion
[17:51:03] <donCams> try $.ajax() too. see if that works
[17:51:13] <cLin> when adding in html on ajax success, would my current html functions apply to it?
[17:51:52] <cLin> or does html already have to be loaded (not via ajax) for the fucntions to work
[17:54:46] <cLin> ahh, nevermind
[17:54:51] <cLin> i need to use .live()
[18:26:26] <rocktop> I would like to create a form with (multiple of  input text and file type ) its possible to add input file and text type to this form using ajax ?
[18:33:20] <whomp> k ill try it
[18:35:00] <mikeycgto> rocktop, you can't upload files over ajax
[18:35:38] <fris> since when
[18:45:13] <ScaR_Anton> Hi, basically, every 60 seconds I need to get a variable from an MySQL database and use it in a javascript function. Any tips on how I can get this done?
[18:47:21] <kborchers> ScaR_Anton: you'll need some sort of server side script to get the variable out of the db, then use setTimeout to make an AJAX call to that server side script every 60 seconds and in the success callback of the AJAX call, you can call your other function passing in the data you just got from the db.
[18:47:25] <solidus-river> hey guys, somehow i'm loosing a div i clone and then remove
[18:47:50] <solidus-river> i copy a div into a widgit option and then i reference that option to clone into another div, and then on an event i clear the parent div and my option div gets destroyed
[18:47:59] <kborchers> ScaR_Anton: keep in mind, you don't know how long the AJAX call will take so your 60 seconds may not be perfect
[18:48:35] <ScaR_Anton> Yes, I am used to the setTimeout
[18:48:48] <kborchers> ?demo @ solidus-river
[18:48:48] <bot-t> solidus-river, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:48:51] <ScaR_Anton> And I've gotten something with a query before, but never used is a javascript variable
[19:08:09] <rocktop> mikeycgto: no I just want to create items under an active form when I need it
[19:10:01] <kborchers> rocktop: so what is your question? just if it's possible? yes it is
[19:11:36] <rocktop> kborchers: how to do that ?
[19:12:15] <kborchers> ?append @ rocktop

[19:22:35] <zulax> just wondering how knockout.js compares to jquery
[19:22:40] <zulax> is it just another jquery?
[19:37:23] <kborchers> bot-t: hi
[19:37:23] <bot-t> Hey kborchers
[19:40:35] <zenorg> hi, i'm looking for a tree plugin to convert nested ul's to a nice tree structure that i can use as a form input
[19:40:58] <zenorg> i've been trying jstree, but it's just hiding the outer ul, and i can't seem to get it working at all :(
[19:41:22] <zenorg> so, any suggestions please?
[19:42:43] <zenorg> i see. everyone is in bed here!
[19:43:34] <kborchers> zenorg: i don't have another suggestion but i know a number of people have used jstree successfully. see ?demo
[19:43:35] <bot-t> zenorg, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:44:56] <AdAlpha> @zulax : same here, from what I understood here http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html is that's optimize for connection between Data and UI
[19:45:54] <zenorg> kborchers: ok, thanks, i'll try jsfiddle.net
[19:46:36] <AdAlpha> " As soon as your UI gets nontrivial and has a few overlapping behaviors, things can get tricky and expensive to maintain if you only use jQuery.  "
[19:47:09] <AdAlpha> (knockoutjs's site)
[19:48:10] <kborchers> AdAlpha: fyi, zulax left a while ago ;)
[19:48:56] <AdAlpha> @kborchers, missed that : )
[19:50:03] <AdAlpha> if it could help other folks anyway
[19:51:47] <zenorg> ok, so http://jsfiddle.net/K2fL5/ scroll to the bottom and change #foo4 to just #foo and see the ul disappear
[19:52:29] <zenorg> i'm baffled to say the least
[20:01:17] <fwaokda> I'm using the Jquery UI draggable/droppable but I'm wanting it to "snap" into the droppable area.  Anyone think they could help or point me in a direction?
[20:01:43] <zenorg> oh well what do you know, all the li's HAVE to be dummy anchors :(
[20:02:02] <fwaokda> err nvm been searching droppable "lock" not "snap" doh! got it through google sry
[20:02:05] <zenorg> fwaokda: there's a snap in the options i think
[20:03:36] <fwaokda> hmmm i'll have to look for a link on that thanks
[20:03:40] <kborchers> zenorg: yeah, and make sure you've downloaded the theme css and images as well
[20:07:57] <zenorg> kborchers: the having to wrap in anchors in wrong for me - i just want to provide a list for a select type thing, not a menu system
[20:08:35] <kborchers> zenorg: a tree seems strange to use in a form. what are you trying to do?
[20:09:52] <zenorg> kborchers: well - http://kotowicz.net/jquery-option-tree/demo/demo.html something like example 7 here
[20:11:01] <John__> I need a bit of help. I'm not sure why this decrements below 0. It is not supposed to: http://jsfiddle.net/jBu4X/1/
[20:11:52] <Paganini> zenorgs, I took a horrible approach with a similar situation by using sql php and then updating the page with jquery, wasn't pretty
[20:12:19] <zenorg> John__: why not use ui?
[20:12:37] <kborchers> zenorg: hmm, doesn't look like a good use for tree. why not just use selects loaded via ajax. or maybe use something like this though it's not ready yet wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137997/Menu
[20:12:45] <zenorg> Paganini: well, that's kinda what i'm doing. pulling values out of the db, parsing with php, and then making pretty with jq
[20:12:49] <John__> this is very simple and light weight
[20:13:17] <Edler> hey guys
[20:13:23] <Edler> anyone knows a good slider for photos
[20:13:29] <Edler> that is resizable
[20:13:41] <Edler> which means that if we resize it to another height/width, the images inside will resize too
[20:13:41] <Edler> ?
[20:14:20] <zenorg> i suppose, i only want to allow the user to choose option 1 / option 2. no further depth is required. i could use ajax, but it's faster to just pull all the data out of the db - it's only going to be run locally
[20:15:04] <Paganini> yeah I'm just having a butchers through the code, I didn't use any type of ajax for it, it was purely a value which called a function is_selected(SELECT/OPTIONS HERE etc..);
[20:15:12] <Engin> chrome does not respect MAX_FILE_SIZE  ?
[20:21:33] <kborchers> John__: very strange ... still looking though
[20:21:51] <John__> I appreciate it!
[20:22:15] <Paganini> zenorg do you have the .php file or A .php file which is being called with the correct $_GET i'd for each function?
[20:22:36] <lenswipe> hey guys
[20:22:42] <lenswipe> how do i scale an image using jquery?
[20:22:46] <zenorg> Paganini: it's not an data problem. i have all the data
[20:22:51] <lenswipe> i dont want to do anything fancy like a mini photoshop
[20:23:00] <lenswipe> just take an image and scale it to a set of dimentions
[20:23:01] <zenorg> a:eg(0) means the first anchor found right?
[20:23:52] <Paganini> yeah I'm just trying to psyphon through it
[20:24:01] <Paganini> what seems to be the actuall issue?
[20:24:03] <zenorg> lenswipe: <img src="bleh" width="100"> will scale down to 100 width in browser
[20:24:16] <zenorg> Paganini: like i said above, displaying the data.
[20:24:41] <lenswipe> zenorg, the correct way would be to use CSS, rather than width= however this doesnt work with IE8 for some reason
[20:25:11] <lenswipe> zenorg, http://stpetersbuckie.org.uk/   <--open that with IE7 and 8 and look at the images
[20:27:01] <lenswipe> zenorg, max-height seems not to work with IE8
[20:27:19] <kborchers> John__: here you go ... issue was your if was working but then you were still setting the value of the text input with an undefined newVal. i also improved your input selectors to use .siblings http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/jBu4X/3/
[20:27:40] <Paganini> ye
[20:27:53] <John__> Thank you!
[20:27:57] <kborchers> np
[20:29:34] <zenorg> lenswipe: what you're asking is a server-side problem
[20:30:01] <lenswipe> zenorg, describe to me in what way image presentation is a server side problem
[20:30:18] <zenorg> you want to resize. width="xxx" will rescale
[20:30:19] <lenswipe> zegenie, max-height not working with IE8 is absolutely a client side proble
[20:30:34] <lenswipe> zegenie, did i mention i want to resize images linked to from other sites?
[20:30:43] <lenswipe> zegenie, sudenly it becomes very much a client side problem
[20:31:04] <zenorg> so use width="xxx" and not use css per the problems you noted
[20:31:25] <Paganini> Sorry zenorg but I've trawled and trawled through it and can't seem to find an example of what I used, think it might be on the other machine :/
[20:31:37] <kborchers> good night all
[20:31:40] <zenorg> you're useless Paganini  :P
[20:32:05] <HelloWorld> hello, i want to make a simple inplace text style editor for bold, underline, italic etc, i just need some icon button things, anyone know a good way to do it?
[20:32:37] <zenorg> rich text editors exist already?
[20:33:19] <Paganini> I know man! I swear it was on this machine but it's not long been changed :(
[20:33:50] <lenswipe> zegenie, i think youll find that width= is deprecated
[20:35:53] <Paganini> zenorgL I'm sure sure we used a pure php table though, with jquery purely for any additional on the fly changes so it Id don't think it would have been quit what you were looking for anywayt
[20:37:03] <zenorg> ok, so my new problem is i have a recursive ul / li structure, and i need to wrap a's around the text values
[20:37:42] <zenorg> so <ul><li>asdf</li><li>345<ul><li>tryh</li></ul></li></ul> becomes ... well you get the point
[20:48:56] <buttersb> hey folks, im getting an odd error with jquery-ui-menu
[20:49:05] <buttersb> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method '_bind'
[20:49:20] <zenorg> aha! problem! <li>foo<ul>.....</ul></li> using wrapinner wraps around the whole inside of the li, how do i get just the text value?
[20:54:40] <buttersb> what do you want the text from..?
[20:55:13] <bricker> Can someone take a look at this and find the hole in the logic? It works sometimes, but some times I have to submit the form twice for it to actually send the request.
[20:55:22] <bricker> http://pastie.org/2332925
[20:55:34] <buttersb> create a fiddle if you can, it's better usually
[20:56:37] <buttersb> why you using find? why don't you specifically target the input you want?
[20:56:46] <bricker> buttersb: I think a fiddle in this case would be more confusing.
[20:57:07] <buttersb> bricker, what is the point of the find.
[20:57:27] <bricker> buttersb: will there be a difference? The find is just to replace the submit button with a loading gif
[20:57:56] <buttersb> Ah, so it's for aesthetics.
[20:57:59] <bricker> #song_submit is the ID of the submit button
[20:58:06] <bricker> buttersb: yes
[20:58:08] <buttersb> so you just want to add that class?
[20:58:35] <bricker> yes, and it works sometimes (the first time usually), but then after that it doesn't work properly. There are several of the same form on this page
[20:58:49] <buttersb> ok
[20:59:19] <bricker> I think it is just faulty logic in that code but I can't see it
[20:59:53] <bricker> this code is for aesthetics, and also to prevent the form from being submitted twice (by hitting enter rapidly twice)
[21:00:22] <buttersb> what part is failing for you?
[21:00:29] <buttersb> http://pastie.org/2332942
[21:01:27] <buttersb> is .new_song one of many forms on the same page?
[21:02:22] <bricker> buttersb: yes, .new_song is the class of each form
[21:03:12] <bricker> buttersb: it seems that the submitted variable isn't being properly set sometimes. Sometimes the "loading" gif shows but the form does not get submitted until I hit Enter again
[21:03:13] <buttersb> ok then you probably should have .song_submit, not #song-submit since there are likely more than one on the page
[21:03:49] <bricker> buttersb: right, I will change that, but I'm not sure that's what is causing the issue
[21:04:07] <bricker> let me see
[21:04:10] <ciss_> hi
[21:04:56] <buttersb> http://pastie.org/2332942
[21:05:05] <buttersb> do some debugging of your logic there
[21:05:43] <buttersb> hi
[21:05:51] <bricker> buttersb: thank you, I will give this a shot
[21:05:52] <bricker> thanks
[21:06:02] <dexter_e> Anyone ever tried IcanHazJs ?
[21:06:09] <ciss_> i'm a little confused: has this always been this way? http://jsfiddle.net/37EZn/
[21:06:48] <dexter_e> ciss_: yes, what did you expect ?
[21:07:06] <ciss_> dexter_e: "string"
[21:07:13] <dexter_e> n is getting coerced into a string because its being conctenated
[21:08:51] <buttersb> do this ciss, do console.log('string:',n); then do console.log('string'+n); you will see..
[21:10:16] <ciss_> buttersb: already did, and also checked undefined. i didn't know/expect this
[21:10:39] <ciss_> it only got my attention because of a bug in an app
[21:11:05] <buttersb> yes, var myVar == undefined, not ''||null
[21:11:18] <buttersb> it defaults to undefined, i think as of jquery 1.40 or something
[21:12:39] <ciss_> buttersb: variables have always defaulted to undefined
[21:12:40] <dexter_e> JSfiddle sure is fresh
[21:12:49] <buttersb> jsfiddle is quite fresh :)
[21:12:53] <buttersb> fresh to def you might say
[21:13:03] <dexter_e> hHAHAHAAHA
[21:14:16] <dexter_e> Anyone know of any delimiter-less templating solutions?     Something similar to weld.js or caustic.js ?
[21:14:29] <buttersb> nope.
[21:14:37] <dexter_e> Browser-side templates with no {{ }} or <% %>
[21:14:47] <buttersb> nope, haven't looked into it
[21:14:57] <dexter_e> right on
[21:15:15] <dexter_e> Is there a way to return an array of all ids or all classes within a certain container ?
[21:15:20] <dexter_e> with jQuery ?
[21:15:21] <buttersb> it's sort of a necessary evil though(delimiters that is..)
[21:15:33] <buttersb> of all ids?
[21:15:43] <dexter_e> All IDs in a given container
[21:15:43] <buttersb> um..
[21:15:52] <buttersb> so all ids inside div.blah
[21:15:57] <buttersb> for all the elements within
[21:16:03] <dexter_e>     $('#mydiv').getAllIdArray  or something
[21:16:04] <dexter_e> yeah
[21:16:12] <buttersb> hm, im sure you could fashion something
[21:16:52] <dexter_e> theres no native jQuery method to do tha ?
[21:17:22] <buttersb> you could probably do something like $('#mydiv').children().attr('id') or something
[21:18:00] <buttersb> more specifically, $('#mydiv').children()each(function(i,item){console.log(item.attr('id');}
[21:18:12] <buttersb> $('#mydiv').children().each(function(i,item){console.log(item.attr('id');}
[21:18:51] <dexter_e> buttersb: that looks exactly like what I'm after, but that will only do one level deep
[21:19:19] <buttersb> you sure? did you test it?
[21:19:47] <Paganini> $('mydiv[id]').clone(); then find('id'); might work
[21:19:52] <dexter_e> I didn't test it.  but I've been looking at the children() method on jquery docs and it says its only top level
[21:20:27] <buttersb> then possibly a recursive function that does something
[21:21:09] <dexter_e> Paganini:   $('mydiv['id']').clone()  returns a reference to mydiv ?    as in  var newdiv=$('#mydiv').clone() ?
[21:22:17] <Paganini> I beg your pardon I'm still quite new but if you used clone on mydiv.clone() it should give the whole html of that div then you should be able to use find on it?
[21:22:37] <Paganini> are all the id's of the same element type? i.e. why'd you need 'em?
[21:22:41] <buttersb> Paganini, you are correct.
[21:23:00] <Paganini> woohoo, I can sleep well tonight buttersb :)
[21:23:31] <dexter_e> I want to do delimiter less templates like Weld.js but using a different algorythm
[21:24:07] <buttersb> at least I THINK you are correct lol. Im not going to dbl check right now
[21:24:18] <buttersb> im having my own issue with jquery-ui-menu righ tnow
[21:24:58] <Paganini> yeah, I would just think that assigning a var something = $('mydiv[id=something]').clone(); and then using something.find('element_to_find'); should give )ish the correct result
[21:25:24] <Paganini> using find('element'function(index){//do something with each one}; does it work like that?
[21:25:38] <Paganini> rather than using a recursive .each function
[21:25:39] <gnarf> dexter_e: buttersb: what are you trying to figure out?
[21:26:02] <buttersb> sup gnarf, odd jquery-ui-menu error im getting. one sec let me paste the error
[21:26:12] <buttersb> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method '_bind'
[21:26:30] <buttersb> jquery.ui.menu.js line 48
[21:26:35] <gnarf> buttersb: are you using 1.9?
[21:27:03] <gnarf> cuz you can't just take code from the master branch and expect it to work on 1-8-stable
[21:27:51] <gnarf> Paganini: whats up with this clone/find conversation
[21:28:13] <buttersb> jquery ui 1.8.9 , and <script src="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/raw/master/ui/jquery.ui.menu.js"></script> for menu
[21:28:23] <gnarf> buttersb: read line #2
[21:28:26] <buttersb> yea, i think i grabbed the master...drrr
[21:28:29] <gnarf> you have to use the full master
[21:28:41] <buttersb> full master...?
[21:28:47] <gnarf> like, each component you need?
[21:28:51] <Paganini> I kinda joined halfway through so was probably talking out my arse, but as far as I could tell they wanted to find all id's within a div with a specific id
[21:28:52] <gnarf> build your own jquery ui?
[21:29:06] <gnarf> with a specific id?
[21:29:10] <dexter_e> gnarf:  delimiter-less templating
[21:29:16] <gnarf> id's are unique you know?
[21:29:23] <gnarf> you can just .find("#theId")
[21:29:34] <buttersb> who you talking too..?
[21:29:45] <gnarf> buttersb: 3 people currently apparently
[21:29:52] <buttersb> ha. just making sure :)
[21:29:54] <gnarf> buttersb: you need to grab the full version of master
[21:29:54] <dexter_e> clone does return a reference btw
[21:29:59] <gnarf> buttersb: if you want to play with menu
[21:29:59] <Paganini> I believe it was finding id's even if they weren't specifically named  in a similar convension
[21:30:05] <Paganini> out of interest can you do
[21:30:07] <gnarf> buttersb: or there may be a milestone release
[21:30:11] <Paganini> .find("#");
[21:30:17] <Paganini> would that find ALL id's on a page?
[21:30:22] <gnarf> .find("[id]")
[21:30:29] <gnarf> all elements with an id attrib
[21:30:33] <gnarf> its expensive tho
[21:30:38] <Paganini> yeah I can imagine
[21:30:44] <gnarf> and silly
[21:30:47] <Paganini> unless you use it within another elements scope
[21:30:53] <gnarf> still silly
[21:31:20] <gnarf> there is rarely a reason to iterate/find things with ids
[21:31:25] <Paganini> it was just for my own personal knowledge tbh
[21:31:30] <gnarf> unless you know, you know the one you're looking for
[21:31:52] <Paganini> are finding ID's more expensive than classes and specific elementation even if the scope/amount of results is the same?
[21:32:00] <buttersb> gnarf, im using this too: <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.9/jquery-ui.js"></script>
[21:32:03] <gnarf> huh?
[21:32:27] <gnarf> buttersb: the version of menu you picked out of github is still in development, it only works with ui 1.9
[21:32:30] <gnarf> which is still unreleased
[21:32:50] <gnarf> buttersb: so, if you want to use it... you need to download the full version of ui 1.9 and build it
[21:32:53] <gnarf> or
[21:32:57] <Paganini> anyway enough with the 50 questions ;) cheers gnarf and battersb
[21:33:14] <buttersb> cheers
[21:33:14] <gnarf> copy & host http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.js yourself
[21:33:21] <gnarf> but its a DEVELOPMENT
[21:33:22] <gnarf> version
[21:33:48] <buttersb> I see. is there a rls date for the next ver?
[21:34:04] <gnarf> not yet
[21:34:14] <gnarf> we are working on it
[21:34:17] <gnarf> :)
[21:34:28] <buttersb> it looks like im grabbing 1.8.9, so is menu not implemented there?
[21:34:30] <buttersb> haah :)
[21:34:36] <buttersb> you guys do great work, BWT :)
[21:35:03] <gnarf> theres actually been a bit of work on menu recently i think
[21:35:06] <Paganini> you do jquery ui gnarf?
[21:35:11] <Paganini> development even?
[21:35:31] <gnarf> Paganini: I'm a contributor yup
[21:35:52] <buttersb> hm, im not seeing 1.9. Just do a custom build you said, right?
[21:35:54] <gnarf> doing effects and working on some custom components for grid
[21:36:05] <gnarf> buttersb: there is NO download builder for 1.9
[21:36:12] <gnarf> you have you grab a copy of the git repo
[21:36:14] <Paganini> fair play, if it wasn't for some of your bolton scripts it would have taken me a lot longer to actually get the guts to start using it :) thanks!
[21:36:16] <gnarf> and use what you need
[21:36:37] <gnarf> or - you can take that link earlier
[21:36:40] <buttersb> ah, i found it. theres a link to 'master' on the custom build page at the top
[21:36:42] <gnarf> but that link updates with every commit
[21:36:52] <gnarf> so - do yourself a favor
[21:36:57] <gnarf> and save a copy and host it yourself
[21:37:01] <gnarf> if you are playing with it
[21:37:03] <buttersb> got ya.
[21:37:10] <gnarf> you don't want some change we make breaking your stuff
[21:38:28] <buttersb> So, I'm not sure what all I need in there. There's a lot lol
[21:38:45] <gnarf> buttersb: thats why i said, you can build it yourself
[21:38:48] <gnarf> its pretty simple
[21:38:53] <gnarf> each file tells you which others it needs
[21:39:02] <gnarf> put them all together in the right order
[21:39:04] <gnarf> and compress
[21:40:09] <buttersb> Sounds like....fun lol
[21:40:41] <buttersb> that's a TON of files to organize and concatenate
[21:40:43] <gnarf> if you're curious, looking at the test suite is usually a good way of telling which files need what
[21:40:55] <gnarf> buttersb: its not that many, how many components are you going to use?
[21:41:03] <gnarf> menu ? autocomplete ?
[21:41:24] <buttersb> menu. dialog , and with that a couple effects like highlight, draggable etc
[21:41:31] <buttersb> and button
[21:41:45] <buttersb> and position
[21:41:50] <gnarf> so check it out
[21:41:51] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/dialog/dialog.html
[21:41:56] <gnarf> there is the source for the menu tests
[21:42:08] <gnarf> thats the files (and the order) you need for menu
[21:42:14] <gnarf> do the same with dialog
[21:42:22] <gnarf> add the files together
[21:42:28] <gnarf> and you got yourself a custom build
[21:42:41] <gnarf> effects
[21:42:45] <gnarf> you want effects.core.js
[21:42:48] <buttersb> ok.
[21:42:50] <gnarf> then whatever effect you need
[21:43:10] <gnarf> ?g uglify
[21:43:11] <bot-t> gnarf, mishoo/UglifyJS - GitHub - https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS
[21:43:22] <buttersb> lol @ uglify , wtf is that
[21:43:30] <gnarf> you can use uglify if you have node to "minify" the source you built
[21:43:37] <buttersb> ah got ya.
[21:43:40] <gnarf> viola, your own custom build
[21:43:43] <buttersb> I'm using html5 boilerplate
[21:43:55] <gnarf> you could also use closure compiler or whatever other build chain you have
[21:44:10] <buttersb> so all the dependencies in that order, then menu, button, and then the effects
[21:44:12] <buttersb> all in one file
[21:44:23] <Engin> isn't it interesting that browsers did not implement a way to prevent file upload based on filesize
[21:46:51] <gnarf> buttersb: thats best for your performance yeah
[21:47:09] <gnarf> buttersb: if you include all of them individually thats a lot more requests that need to be made to load the page
[21:47:30] <gnarf> buttersb: are you on mac / win / linux
[21:49:28] <buttersb> this machine is win
[21:49:34] <gnarf> lame
[21:49:44] <buttersb> haha,
[21:49:45] <gnarf> otherwise its just cat file1 file2 file3 > output.js
[21:49:49] <buttersb> haha yea.
[21:49:50] <gnarf> ;)
[21:50:05] <buttersb> i probably could on aptana shell (tear* for lack of real shell/term
[21:51:32] <Engin> I've did my own uploader, what do you think, http://gettingback.at/
[21:52:59] <buttersb> let me see if this custom build works
[21:54:08] <gnarf> afk a bit
[21:54:12] <gnarf> walking up to the store
[21:54:23] <buttersb> Cannot set property 'fade' of undefined
[21:54:24] <buttersb> damn
[21:54:25] <buttersb> cool
[22:00:56] <buttersb> i think i got something out of order..
[22:06:10] <gnarf> buttersb: was there an error?
[22:08:52] <buttersb> yea
[22:08:57] <buttersb> a prop error and hilight error
[22:09:04] <buttersb> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'removeClass' of undefined
[22:09:16] <buttersb> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'fade' of undefined
[22:09:46] <gnarf> are you using jQuery 1.6+?
[22:09:50] <buttersb> yeap
[22:10:01] <buttersb> oh woops, 1.5.2
[22:10:19] <gnarf> 1.6.2 is what master is built against
[22:10:35] <buttersb> ok one sec
[22:10:47] <buttersb> any other possible conflicts from switching to 1.6.2 ?
[22:11:09] <gnarf> the attr func changed meaning a little
[22:11:17] <buttersb> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'fade' of undefined
[22:11:19] <gnarf> but attr/prop are the only real breaking change afaik
[22:11:28] <buttersb> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'removeClass' of undefined
[22:11:35] <gnarf> have you minified yet?
[22:11:52] <buttersb> No i have not minified anything. That shouldn't improve the compatibility should it?
[22:11:55] <gnarf> k
[22:11:58] <gnarf> nope
[22:12:01] <gnarf> just curious
[22:12:09] <gnarf> which file is it that you're seeing that error in?
[22:12:22] <buttersb> its all in one huge file
[22:12:30] <buttersb> in my custom
[22:12:44] <gnarf> right
[22:12:48] <buttersb> did i misunderstand you? I essentially put them in order, inside one file
[22:12:49] <gnarf> you copy the headers too right?
[22:12:54] <buttersb> the headers?
[22:12:59] <gnarf> comments?
[22:13:04] <buttersb> yep
[22:13:09] <gnarf> scroll up and figure out which file that error is in
[22:13:48] <buttersb> one sec
[22:14:02] <abjorn> ãƒ½( ï¾Ÿ ãƒ®ï¾Ÿ)ãƒŽ
[22:14:12] <buttersb> the 'fade' error is showing up in effects.core
[22:14:45] <fwaokda> why wont jquery ui "draggable" work on my mobile device?
[22:14:56] <gnarf> buttersb: are you trying to use the fade effect?
[22:15:01] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky ãƒ½( ï¾Ÿ ãƒ®ï¾Ÿ)ãƒŽ
[22:15:01] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[22:15:14] <gnarf> buttersb: cuz the word "fade" doesn't appear in that file
[22:15:44] <buttersb> and the removeClass is in the widget
[22:15:58] <buttersb> yea, i have the fade somewher.
[22:16:00] <buttersb> wher eis it
[22:16:37] <buttersb> because i have the fade effect in there towards the end
[22:20:44] <buttersb> any idea..?
[22:21:18] <gnarf> buttersb: can you pastebin the file? does it break right away, or when you're using it for something?
[22:21:25] <gnarf> or can you share a live link
[22:21:27] <gnarf> so i can debug
[22:21:38] <buttersb> I don't have  live link at the moment, but i can certainly pastebin
[22:23:24] <buttersb> says my pastie is too big lol
[22:24:12] <gnarf> prolly is :)
[22:24:20] <buttersb> http://pastebin.com/TjBzZGhn
[22:24:21] <gnarf> what order did you put the files in, i can do the same order
[22:24:40] <buttersb> pastie didn't like it, but pastebin took it :) yay
[22:24:45] <gnarf> and these errors, they are happening on load?
[22:24:59] <bricker> has anybody experienced the jquery ui autocomplete feature not hiding the dropdown boxes when a form is submitted?
[22:25:24] <bricker> infact the dropdown boxes sometimes move to the top-left of the screen and stay there until I click somewhere else
[22:25:44] <buttersb> yea, basically.
[22:26:18] <buttersb> the .button ui affect isn't taking place on my elements, however in my kludgy 1.8.9 + 1.9 menu load that i had earlier it was loading
[22:26:50] <gnarf> buttersb: basically, or is
[22:26:58] <gnarf> like if you include just this jquery ui build
[22:27:02] <gnarf> you get these errors?
[22:27:04] <gnarf> jquery + this
[22:27:45] <buttersb> so jquery + this = my current situation
[22:30:48] <gnarf> without any of your code, those errors happen?
[22:31:12] <gnarf> my best guess is you're missing one of the dependencys
[22:31:19] <buttersb> if i remove my code, I assume it all works. I can tell you wher in my code, the code driving the error is
[22:31:42] <gnarf> buttersb: sure, whats the stack look like
[22:32:33] <buttersb> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'removeClass' of undefined

[22:32:38] <buttersb> oops
[22:32:41] <buttersb> yikes.
[22:32:43] <buttersb> sorry about that
[22:33:52] <gnarf> buttersb: button is missing
[22:34:07] <gnarf> it should be before dialog
[22:34:13] <buttersb> bahhhhh. i think it's in there, so i thought
[22:34:14] <buttersb> one sec
[22:34:57] <magcius> Is there a file uploader thing, like plUpload, but *just* implements the backends, and not the UI?
[22:36:20] <buttersb> um, most of those backends are flash/php
[22:36:31] <magcius> no, PHP is not what I mean.
[22:36:36] <magcius> Not the server-side backend.
[22:36:53] <gnarf> thats kinda the definition of "back end" in web programming btw
[22:36:54] <magcius> The backend driving the upload implementation: whether it's the HTML5 FileList stuff, HTML4's archaic form system
[22:37:08] <gnarf> magcius: plupload is pretty configurable
[22:37:15] <magcius> gnarf, OK.
[22:37:17] <buttersb> just go into the js of any of those and check it out
[22:37:24] <buttersb> get a feel for the guts.
[22:37:26] <magcius> gnarf, do you have knowledge of it?
[22:37:33] <magcius> buttersb, I'm not going to fork PLUpload.
[22:37:35] <gnarf> i use it, but I'm happy with the UI
[22:37:42] <magcius> gnarf, the default UI?
[22:37:44] <gnarf> yeah
[22:37:47] <magcius> OK.
[22:37:54] <buttersb> now its Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'cleanData' of undefined
[22:37:58] <buttersb> and _super
[22:38:01] <buttersb> wtf. hmm lol
[22:38:13] <magcius> buttersb, pastebin your ocde?
[22:38:17] <buttersb> one sec
[22:38:47] <buttersb> http://pastebin.com/qbTvR56k
[22:39:04] <gnarf> buttersb: what line is that one on?
[22:39:15] <bricker> any ideas why/how to fix the autocomplete drop-downs not hiding on form submit with Enter key? I tried telling it to blur the input on submit, to no avail.
[22:39:40] <buttersb> you got any funky css going on bricker?
[22:40:23] <buttersb> gnarf . super is :360
[22:40:28] <buttersb> scuse me..i lied
[22:40:44] <buttersb> cleanData is 360, super is 1050
[22:41:32] <bricker> buttersb: I don't think soâ€¦ I think the issue is because the drop-downs know to hide on input blur, but technically when the form is submitted with the Enter key, the input never loses focus
[22:42:21] <buttersb> are you ajax submitting?
[22:42:32] <buttersb> or you just want the drop-down to go awy before the post?
[22:42:57] <compact> Hi, i have http://www.couponic.com.au/deals/test-zumba then i have tabs down lower
[22:43:08] <compact> if you click on redeem deal, it shows a map which doesnt show properly?
[22:43:09] <gnarf> bricker: you can .autocomplete( "close" ) maybe?
[22:43:17] <compact> i know vars are passing, because when ints outside the tab it works fine
[22:43:24] <compact> any idea where ic an look to see why this is happening
[22:43:52] <gnarf> buttersb: so like. neither of those errors make sense without looking at the actual error i don't think
[22:44:00] <bricker> gnarf: I didn't know about that, thanks!
[22:44:09] <buttersb> you mean, what in my code is causing the error?
[22:45:30] <buttersb> for clean data, the stack says 'mouseHandled' on 360
[22:46:12] <buttersb> looks like its being caused when i build the button
[22:46:21] <compact> gnarf any ieda for me ;P
[22:48:30] <gnarf> compact: none sorry - tbh i never clicked on the link
[22:48:34] <buttersb> and this is what i build the button with : http://pastebin.com/bTX1DRnk
[22:48:55] <compact> dam
[22:49:03] <gnarf> buttersb: out of curiositu
[22:49:13] <gnarf> can you try using the ui-git version i linked earlier?
[22:49:15] <gnarf> the full thing?
[22:49:24] <buttersb> um, can you re-linky?
[22:49:27] <gnarf> it might be possible that your situation is just a back compat issue
[22:49:45] <gnarf> http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.js
[22:50:09] <buttersb> let me replace that in my html
[22:51:59] <buttersb> BAM!
[22:52:00] <buttersb> that works
[22:52:33] <buttersb> boom goes the dynamite
[22:53:41] <random123> whats wrong with your dynamite
[22:54:17] <buttersb> nothing, since it went boom :)
[22:54:49] <random123> it should go kaboom
[22:55:31] <buttersb> ah, i see :)
[22:55:45] <buttersb> it is a ref to this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W45DRy7M1no
[22:55:47] <gnarf> buttersb: then something is missing
[22:55:53] <gnarf> buttersb: not sure what :)
[22:56:02] <gnarf> might not be documented (yet) *shrugs*
[22:56:19] <buttersb> however, having one small issue that is causing me headaches.
[22:56:32] <buttersb> once i build the menu, i cant attach a click event to the menu items
[22:56:36] <buttersb> like it wont do it at all
[22:56:57] <random123> lol
[22:57:13] <gnarf> buttersb: use the "select" event
[22:57:27] <buttersb> you watching it random123?
[22:57:36] <buttersb> it's quite funny.
[22:58:01] <random123> yes, boom goes the dynamite from now on
[22:58:22] <buttersb> haha :)
[22:58:43] <buttersb> It honestly wasn't the kids fault. The teleprompter was WAY OFF and running fast or something. No matter what though, it's GOLD
[23:00:34] <buttersb> so $( ".selector" ).menut({select:function(e){// some stuff} ... right?
[23:00:36] <random123> thats my life
[23:02:30] <buttersb> select: function(event, ui) {event.stopPropagation();console.log(ui); /// isn't working.
[23:02:33] <buttersb> im getting nothing. wtf
[23:03:28] <gnarf> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/visual/menu/menu.html# buttersb example code
[23:05:29] <buttersb> still nothing gnarf. I'm doing the same thing in my as they are
[23:05:52] <buttersb> http://pastie.org/2333253
[23:06:50] <gnarf> buttersb: i'm no expert in menu
[23:07:11] <gnarf> can you set up a jsfiddle ?
[23:07:16] <buttersb> um, sure
[23:07:18] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/NmLck/
[23:07:19] <buttersb> i think so one sec
[23:07:22] <gnarf> thats using edge
[23:07:24] <gnarf> as a base
[23:07:30] <gnarf> feel free to fork from there
[23:07:50] <gnarf> try just the menu related stuff obvioulsy
[23:08:00] <buttersb> nice, you set up the git repo stuff for me ;)
[23:08:27] <gnarf> for me actually, but yeah ;)
[23:13:29] <buttersb> check it out now : it wont load the menu up right though: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/NmLck/
[23:14:32] <gnarf> buttersb: you need to "fork" it ;)
[23:14:34] <buttersb> ah, i need to remove all the classes and such that jquery-ui adds. That menu is created dynamically, so thats sort of a pain
[23:14:45] <gnarf> buttersb: don't remove, override
[23:14:54] <gnarf> those classes are used for things
[23:15:04] <buttersb> http://jsfiddle.net/sbvJj/
[23:15:34] <buttersb> if you look, you will see what i mean
[23:16:19] <gnarf> put the code that creates the menu in the js too?
[23:16:31] <gnarf> fake out the "data" if you need to
[23:16:53] <buttersb> bah, that's a reall pain in the but
[23:16:53] <buttersb> hah
[23:18:24] <gnarf> run the code, skip the menu creation copy the html at that point?
[23:19:56] <buttersb> yea. i am
[23:24:07] <buttersb> does the :select event occur on the LI or the a inside the li?
[23:24:20] <gnarf> on the menu
[23:24:43] <buttersb> ok, so the li
[23:24:49] <buttersb> from the looks of the console.log()
[23:25:58] <gnarf> you mean what does ui.item point to? :)
[23:26:19] <gnarf> i'm pretty sure the event itself happens on the menu ;)
[23:26:58] <compact> Hi, i have http://www.couponic.com.au/deals/test-zumba then i have tabs down lower
[23:27:04] <compact> i know vars are passing, because when ints outside the tab it works fine
[23:27:07] <compact> any idea where ic an look to see why this is happening
[23:27:20] <buttersb> when i do the $('.selector').menu({select:function(event,ui}{console.log(ui);})  ...that gives me the li
[23:31:16] <gnarf> buttersb: i know kborchers hangs out in here sometimes
[23:31:27] <buttersb> hangs out where?
[23:31:29] <gnarf> if you see him around, he's been digging into menu for a bit
[23:31:34] <gnarf> #jquery
[23:33:44] <buttersb> ok cool. thanks
[23:36:13] <compact> gnarf, any idea for me? soz, its been annoying me for ages :P
[23:36:14] <compact> cant find problem
[23:37:17] <gnarf> compact: nope, tbh, i still haven't clicked on your link...
[23:37:50] <gnarf> perhaps try using jsfiddle, or a pastebin, paste the section of code you're having issues with
[23:38:00] <gnarf> ?p
[23:38:01] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:38:38] <dexter_e> Intercepting  <a href> click and preventDefault...  How to access the href value to process?
[23:39:18] <compact> ok ty
[23:43:20] <buttersb> there is some buggyness in the blur event
[23:43:33] <buttersb> blur apparently references the li element, not the whole menu losing focus.
[23:43:38] <buttersb> so it makes it jittery
