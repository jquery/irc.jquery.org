[00:03:56] <dkog> Hello - I'm confused about the plugins repository.  It went offline over a year ago (accidental deletion), and there was supposed to be a new one, but everybody just stopped talking about it.  Any info please?
[00:04:08] <prasanth_g> http://jsfiddle.net/qchqv/2/
[00:09:47] <ravenzz> prasanth_g would be ok if it is implemented in plain js (no jQuery)?
[00:09:56] <prasanth_g> yes
[00:10:11] <prasanth_g> np
[00:10:13] <prasanth_g> :)
[00:10:15] <ravenzz> when do you want it to stop?
[00:10:35] <prasanth_g> when we hover or when we click an element
[00:10:45] <Planet_EN> is there anyplace where I can see whats changed between jquery 1.4 and jquery 1.8?
[00:12:16] <ravenzz> yes
[00:12:26] <ravenzz> it is called changelog :p
[00:12:45] <prasanth_g> but the thing is, i will be displaying some youtube videos too. if we click play button, the video plays for a while depending on video length
[00:13:03] <prasanth_g> so, can we make it pause till the video ends and play the rotation again?
[00:15:27] <ravenzz> ok but what if you use a prebuilt plugin for slideshows?
[00:15:48] <ravenzz> there are many that supports the pause thing
[00:17:14] <ravenzz> eg http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/
[00:17:50] <prasanth_g> not a slider
[00:18:09] <prasanth_g> just a rotator to display random texts and videos
[00:20:37] <prasanth_g> if it is text, we can hover,focus and read. when we mouseout it rotates after few secs. but if it is a video, the playback length varies and we cant set specific timeout to rotate
[00:27:37] <ravenzz> well you could do that with a slider
[00:29:36] <prasanth_g> ok
[00:31:21] <prasanth_g> flexslider looks nice
[00:31:30] <prasanth_g> will give a try
[01:27:09] <kryl> Is there any way to create popup (or dialog) dynamically with Jquery Mobile ?
[01:27:45] <kryl> I want to custom the content of the popup if it is possible of course.
[01:28:05] <eip56> sup nerds
[01:29:18] <kryl> ?
[02:04:25] <eip56> Shouldn't .on() react the same as .live() trying to get an elemet on click after it was jsut added
[02:04:36] <eip56> does not recognize the click or not catching it
[02:07:11] <aqeel> hi room
[02:08:14] <eip56> hi aqeel
[02:08:46] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/ZAzXU/
[02:09:12] <aqeel> my totop: is perfect but to bottom is not working as expected...
[02:09:23] <aqeel> tobottom:*
[02:09:55] <aqeel> $(this).stop(true).animate({                             scrollTop: $(this).height()                         }, 'fast');
[02:10:09] <aqeel> why it does not scroll to bottom?
[02:11:23] <aqeel> it scrolls but not to bottom and on after first click, all other clicks will scroll in opposite direction...as if height is in between of the div
[02:12:12] <aqeel> well my content is loaded from third page via load() and the div it is loaded into is overflow hidden
[02:12:25] <aqeel> live example here...
[02:13:10] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com, click details, click first link in menu, click first link in submenu, try clicking the doubleup and double down arrow
[02:15:10] <AHMED_> Hello Every body
[02:15:15] <aqeel> hi
[02:15:59] <eip56> aqeel no markup to go with it?
[02:16:09] <aqeel> ??
[02:16:32] <aqeel> i have providedlink for live example....
[02:16:40] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com, click details, click first link in menu, click first link in submenu, try clicking the doubleup and double down arrow
[02:16:45] <aqeel> it is a plugin
[02:16:47] <eip56> yea saw that looking now
[02:17:15] <aqeel> mouseover content will pause it
[02:17:47] <aqeel> move mouse out of the content pane
[02:17:59] <aqeel> eip56: ^^
[02:19:14] <eip56> ohh god im going to have a seazure with all this lorem ipsum
[02:19:27] <aqeel> for testing purpose
[02:21:20] <aqeel> so if you click double down arrow it does not go to the bottom of the page?
[02:24:47] <aqeel> my guess is it is taking the height of the container and not the scroll content
[02:34:13] <aqeel> eip56: any luck?
[02:46:31] <eip56> no not yet
[02:50:41] <aqeel> i can explain some of the stuff..
[02:50:57] <aqeel> but what i dont get is what this is referceing here
[02:51:20] <aqeel> scrollTop: $(this).height()
[02:51:36] <aqeel> is it the height of container or is it the height of scrollable content?
[02:52:21] <aqeel> because my container is on one page and the scrollable content is on other page loaded via load()
[02:52:25] <eip56> aqeel do a console.log($(this)); tell me what it says
[02:52:28] <eip56> Anyone know why you cant dynamically add fb comments in
[02:52:46] <eip56> you might be selecting the wrong thing
[02:53:05] <aqeel> ok let me log it
[02:55:23] <aqeel> yup it is getting the height of the container and not the scrollable content
[02:55:47] <aqeel> thanks... eip56 for the console hint
[02:55:59] <eip56> $(document).height() aqeel
[02:56:20] <eip56> always use console.log it will save you hours sometimes on 'this' issues
[02:56:22] <aqeel> i guess need to make use of console a habbit
[02:56:31] <eip56> i used to do the same thing man
[02:56:46] <aqeel> thanks a million for the buggggggg i got into
[02:56:53] <eip56> i actually used to alert() everything like a  noob lol
[02:57:14] <aqeel> haha...
[02:58:32] <aqeel> eip56: i think document will also not do it as the contenet is loaded from wxternal page and document will take into account where the content was loaded into
[02:58:53] <aqeel> and not the content itself
[03:10:20] <onebitxajax> hi to all
[03:10:37] <onebitxajax> i want to extend the animate function, so i can add a new argument
[03:10:59] <onebitxajax> how can i do this? i must change the jquery.animate file? or can i extend it with my own class?
[03:14:38] <onebitxajax> is there someone online?
[03:20:30] <aqeel> jquery.animate file??
[03:20:35] <aqeel> lol
[03:20:45] <aqeel> that is in core of jquery.js itself
[03:21:08] <aqeel> you can always extend the jquery already avalable methods
[03:21:35] <aqeel> onebitxajax: what are you trrying to do here
[03:22:24] <aqeel> jquery ui have already extended animate() might wanna take a look into it
[03:22:27] <onebitxajax> aqeel: i already write an animation function fo text-shadow, i want to insert it in animate
[03:23:03] <aqeel> ?animate()
[03:23:05] <onebitxajax> aqeel: so someone just put textShadow : #FF
[03:23:36] <aqeel> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[03:23:49] <onebitxajax> aqeel: $().animate({width:20,height:30,textShadow:"fff"})
[03:24:28] <aqeel> well you have to see what is supported,...i am not sure for text shadow...you might have to pass it as a callback function
[03:25:50] <onebitxajax> i hope i can do something like, $.fn.animate[some:Magic:thing]=function(a,b,c,d){my_text_shadow_function}
[03:28:50] <aqeel> onebitxajax: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[03:52:42] <aqeel> eip56: $(this).stop(true).animate({scrollTop: $(this).prop("scrollHeight")}, 'fast');
[03:52:45] <aqeel> this does it
[04:24:51] <hughaj> question: I am creating fragments and trying to append them one at a time to a div, $('#id').append(getFragment(params)); but they seem to overwrite each other, are the fragments becoming the same instance and just updating themselves?
[04:26:07] <shoky> hughaj are you sure you're creating a new one each time and not appending the same one
[04:26:49] <hughaj> That's what I'm not sure about, I'm calling a function which returns a fragment, so I thought it should be scoped as I am setting in the function for return each time
[04:27:09] <shoky> doesn't have to do with scope
[04:27:14] <hughaj> I have two columns, each only gets one fragment entered, but the log clearly shows multiple
[04:27:16] <shoky> what does getFragment do
[04:28:09] <hughaj> it creates a new div, and populates it with an image, a div and some text inside the nested div
[04:28:16] <shoky> pastebin that
[04:28:45] <hughaj> one moment
[04:29:42] <shoky> and/or reproduce it in a jsfiddle
[04:30:39] <hughaj> I think I have actually seen the problem copying the code actually, I missed something when I refactored it
[04:30:58] <Drager> Is it possible on this; http://jsfiddle.net/YW5P4/ so the "Show" and "Hide" goes after how the content is display. Try to spam the button and you'll see.
[04:32:15] <callmekatootie> anybody here? I need some help with my jquery code...
[04:32:30] <callmekatootie> http://jsfiddle.net/8yRaA/ - this is the fiddle
[04:32:56] <callmekatootie> What I am trying to achieve is that when the user clicks on the <div> container
[04:33:09] <callmekatootie> the <div> is replaced with an <input> tag
[04:33:33] <callmekatootie> if the user clicks outside the <input> tag, then the <div> container is brought back again
[04:33:39] <callmekatootie> this works, but only once...
[04:33:50] <shoky> Drager: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/YW5P4/3/
[04:34:07] <callmekatootie> any further attempts to show the <input> by clicking in the <div> does not work...
[04:34:10] <callmekatootie> any clue why?
[04:34:46] <hughaj> Yeah it was scoped wrong, my own stupid fault. Working now :) sorry for wasting your time shoky
[04:35:20] <callmekatootie> shoky:  maybe you can help me out?
[04:38:34] <troop> hi. simply, how can i print content of a variable to paragraph? $("p").text() = var ?
[04:39:07] <ravenzz> ?text @ troop
[04:39:42] <troop> i'm want to print variable's content to screen
[04:39:44] <ravenzz> var foo = "Ready? foo!"; $("p").text(foo);
[04:39:55] <troop> ok trying
[04:40:23] <troop> ravenzz thank you
[04:40:25] <troop> :)
[04:40:38] <ravenzz> take in mind that if you want to append html as well you should use html() instead
[04:40:49] <shoky> callmekatootie: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/8yRaA/1/
[04:41:02] <shoky> callmekatootie: read about event delegation, see ?on
[04:41:06] <troop> append, new element?
[04:41:21] <callmekatootie> shoky:  PERFECT!
[04:41:24] <ravenzz> well not append, insert I mean
[04:41:35] <callmekatootie> shoky:  just a sec, let me see what changes did you do..
[04:41:39] <troop> ok thanks ravenzz
[04:41:48] <ravenzz> yeah like var foo = "<span>foo</span>"; $("p").html(foo);
[04:42:43] <ravenzz> troop you can also read the documentation btw, just search on google: html jquery
[04:42:55] <troop> ok:)
[04:42:58] <callmekatootie> shoky:  Erm.. so using .on() instead of .click() did the trick?
[04:43:01] <ravenzz> or thext jquery
[04:43:08] <callmekatootie> I need to read about .on()
[04:43:15] <Drager> shoky: Nice, thanks
[04:43:17] <shoky> callmekatootie:  using .on() with event delegation did the trick.
[04:43:46] <callmekatootie> Thanks a ton shoky ! I'll read more about this
[04:43:47] <ravenzz> callmekatootie basically you are not binding to .new-section directly
[04:44:13] <callmekatootie> ravenzz:  ok... so what am I binding to?
[04:44:29] <callmekatootie> I mean I do see that the click event is registered for .new-section
[04:44:51] <callmekatootie> so, aren't I binding directly?
[04:44:59] <callmekatootie> maybe I need to read about the .on() function
[04:45:04] <ravenzz> yeah
[04:45:05] <shoky> callmekatootie:  $('.new-section').click(...)  looks for all .new-section elements and binds an event handler to them directly
[04:45:29] <callmekatootie> whereas .on() will....?
[04:45:34] <ravenzz> it filters the descendant of the element that trigger the event
[04:45:37] <shoky> callmekatootie:  so if you dynamically add a .new-section element afterwards, it wont have an event handler bound to it
[04:45:40] <ravenzz> in this case document
[04:45:52] <callmekatootie> shoky:  ahhh
[04:46:22] <callmekatootie> shoky: that explains why it worked only the first time.. brilliant!
[04:46:32] <shoky> .on() by itself is the same as doing .click()
[04:46:52] <shoky> but .on() with that selector argument does event delegation. as you can read about in the docs
[04:47:21] <shoky> also notice the .on() is now on $(document)
[04:48:27] <ravenzz> you would probably bind to the closest parent
[04:50:26] <callmekatootie> shoky:  ravenzz: got it. Thanks.
[04:51:19] <callmekatootie> shoky: ravenzz: double thanks. I was breaking my head trying to understand what was wrong, did lots of google searches but could not figure out what was wrong. So thanks again!
[04:52:34] <shoky> callmekatootie: np. any special reason you're doing it like this and not just having both of those elements in the DOM, with one of them hidden
[04:53:49] <callmekatootie> shoky:  Well... I am new to HTML, CSS and Javascript. So, I figured this was the way to go.
[04:54:08] <shoky> callmekatootie: it's not ;]
[04:54:35] <shoky> callmekatootie: having much html in your javascript code is usually not a great idea
[04:54:37] <callmekatootie> shoky:  SO you propose that I have both the elements, one after another. When the page loads, the <input> gets the display: none CSS property
[04:54:54] <callmekatootie> shoky:  and then use the toggle or something like that?
[04:55:16] <shoky> something like that, yeah
[04:55:37] <ravenzz> you shouldn't hide important stuff with css btw
[04:56:13] <ravenzz> if your script fails the user is not able to complete the task/whatever
[04:57:53] <callmekatootie> ravenzz:  Erm.. in this case, the application will be built using javascript. As in, if the user disables scripting, then this application will not work. So, I guess it would be ok to hide using CSS?
[04:58:29] <ravenzz> you choose
[04:59:27] <ravenzz> I tend to start with a minimal working page html only, then adding css and js on top of it
[04:59:53] <callmekatootie> ravenzz:  :D I guess its ok. Anyhow, this is the first time I have managed to get this far. So, I have miles to go in committing mistakes and learning from them :)
[05:00:49] <callmekatootie> ravenzz:  Yup - Whichever document I have read instructs me to do so, but since I am still getting the hang of this... for now, I am doing the HTML first, then doing the CSS and then the JS.
[05:00:50] <ravenzz> yeah np, just saying (suggesting)
[05:01:03] <callmekatootie> after which the cycle repeats as I keep deciding what more I need to add
[05:01:14] <aqeel> no need to go extreme as document, body will suffice
[05:01:28] <aqeel> in .on()
[05:01:35] <ravenzz> aqeel it is still too much imo
[05:01:59] <ravenzz> the closer is the ancestor the better right?
[05:02:02] <aqeel> yes better the parent container but if in doubt use bodt
[05:02:11] <aqeel> body*
[05:02:28] <shoky> callmekatootie: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/8yRaA/4/
[05:02:31] <aqeel> window and document are extreme
[05:03:30] <shoky> callmekatootie: that's what you should aim for, in terms of seperation between html/css/js
[05:06:07] <ravenzz> not really :p
[05:07:21] <shoky> no? you like html in your JS?
[05:08:36] <ravenzz> you can always use a tiny template engine
[05:08:55] <shoky> you can use tons of things
[05:10:15] <aqeel> my approach, css + html + js ...all seperate files
[05:10:24] <shoky> ..
[05:10:41] <aqeel> css ---> texh + styles...seperate
[05:11:10] <aqeel> js all individual functionality in each of its own seperate files
[05:15:04] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/p7mCh/
[05:15:57] <ravenzz> lul the reserved word new
[05:41:46] <troop> http://pastebin.com/9g3sHyhb what's wrong?
[05:43:23] <xec_> troop: dunno, what does the markup look like? does the selectors work?
[05:43:37] <xec_> ?demo
[05:43:43] <troop> wait
[05:44:33] <troop> xec_ http://yigitozmen.com/3burcakyeni/sonuc.php
[05:47:03] <xec_> troop: $("#buyukresim p").length returns 0 on that page
[05:47:47] <troop> how can i print it to screen?
[05:47:55] <xec_> troop: maybe you brobably want just $("#buyukresim").html(... on line 5
[05:48:12] <xec_> probably*
[05:48:17] <xec_> s/maybe//
[05:48:39] <troop> doesnt work
[05:49:08] <troop> i just want to changeover between images
[05:49:27] <troop> ah, it works now
[05:49:29] <troop> :)
[05:49:54] <troop> it works but fadeout doesnt work now
[05:50:15] <troop> look at the page xec_
[05:50:22] <xec_> because you're fading out an image, and you're not showing an image?
[05:50:47] <troop> first fadeout image then print paragraph?
[05:51:00] <xec_> i mean, you hide it on 1st click and it's not made visible again
[05:51:16] <xec_> works as i would expect tbh :P
[05:52:18] <troop> interesting
[05:52:24] <xec_> i'm all for making stuff yourself, but there are a lot of slider plugins that does just what you (appear to) want
[05:52:56] <Asa341> Hi all. I having problem with a selector trying to use droppbalbe on an outer container but not in an inner container that is floated
[05:53:17] <troop> yes a lot of plugin but i want to understand how it works, if i success to make it, then i will interest with plugins. first i have to do it myself :)
[05:53:29] <Asa341> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13894269/jquery-ui-select-outer-container-and-not-inner-container-for-drop-target
[05:59:30] <xec_> Asa341: isn't that what the cancel option (on draggables) is for? http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-cancel
[06:01:20] <xec_> Asa341: the selector you're using is really odd as well - ".media-content:not(.media-list-items), .media-content" will select exactly the same as just ".media-content"
[06:02:03] <xec_> the comma in css is basically a logical OR
[06:05:37] <xec_> Asa341: also, as a side-note tip, if you increase your accept rate on stackoverflow you're more likely to get answers
[06:06:03] <aqeel> nope it is not logical or
[06:06:56] <Asa341> i'll take a look at the cancel option
[06:07:47] <Asa341> if not i thought about changing the css to use display table. I need both columns to be equal height
[06:09:04] <xec_> Asa341: a working demo of the issue on jsfiddle.net would also be very useful
[06:09:28] <troop> xec_ you there?
[06:09:57] <xec_> troop: nope, im doing laundry at the moment
[06:10:01] <troop> http://yigitozmen.com/3burcakyeni/sonuc.php look at the page
[06:10:02] <troop> ok
[06:10:07] <troop> i think i did it.
[06:11:23] <xec_> yeah, only works on the 1st button? and no animation?
[06:12:13] <Asa341> it's difficult to extract from a cms I'm building
[06:13:00] <troop> yes, only first two :D
[06:13:02] <xec_> Asa341: just make it from scratch, there are dropdowns and checkboxes for both jquery and jquery ui on jsfiddle.net
[06:13:04] <troop> and with no animation :D
[06:13:30] <Asa341> Basically I have a container with a grey background. Within that there is a list of items that are floated left 60% width of the contaier with a with a white background
[06:14:26] <Asa341> the remaining 40% will have a grey background 100% height of the container. I only want to be able to drop in this area
[06:15:07] <xec_> Asa341: i'm confident you're able to make the containers and floats in jsfiddle without too much hassle or having to copy from the cms :)
[06:18:24] <Asa583> screenshot: http://derp.co.uk/1af86
[06:18:53] <Asa583> hopefully this will help visualise it
[06:19:48] <xec_> yep, visualized :) but can't really debug it or play with the code
[06:20:52] <Asa583> ok. I'll try and put something together. might be a few minutes. The code on S.O. is pretty much what i have though
[06:21:59] <xec_> did you have a look at the cancel option? (and did you understand what i said about the selector?)
[06:26:05] <Asa583> cancel doesnt look like the thing i'm looing for
[06:26:28] <Asa583> it's a problem with where i'm dropping to rather than dragging from
[06:26:45] <Asa583> and anyway I'm using sortable and droppable
[06:27:20] <Asa583> yep, i understood the selector. That's what i thought as well
[06:27:35] <Asa583> I just found that from a similar SO question
[06:36:29] <fiqi> yahaaa..
[06:40:59] <Asa583> ok got a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/KazeG/3/
[06:41:19] <Asa583> I only want to be able to drop in the grey area.
[06:46:48] <rabbi1> how can i append() and element to the top of the parent element ?
[06:46:58] <rabbi1> *an element
[06:47:44] <rabbi1> prepend () ?
[07:04:56] <xec_> Asa583: I didn't see your link till just now, feel free to ping me by including my nick in messages ;)
[07:05:22] <xec_> Asa583: any reason you're not using a seperate element for the "trash" area?
[07:09:08] <xec_> Asa583: http://jsfiddle.net/KazeG/5/
[07:10:18] <Asa583> xec_: yep, so the grey area has the full height of the content in media-list-items
[07:10:36] <xec_> Asa583: did you see my demo?
[07:11:28] <xec_> Asa583: my foresight accounted for that ;D
[07:11:37] <xec_> added some css
[07:11:49] <xenome> is there a way to force an iframe (the sole item in a content region) to use the entire width and height (i want to remove the margins around it with regards to the content area)
[07:11:53] <Asa583> ah excellent
[07:12:17] <jefoo> hi !
[07:12:20] <Asa583> xec_: thanks, that will do the trick :)
[07:12:45] <xec_> cool :) i'll add it as an answer on SO
[07:14:16] <jefoo> I use $(window).load(callback) to wait until the page is full loaded, and my callback function is to fadeout the "loading" div. but the div never fadeout, and if i replace de fadeout function by alert('page loaded'), this work. why ?
[07:18:11] <Asa583> xec_: thanks :)
[07:28:52] <hombretao> hello #jquery
[07:29:24] <hombretao> i was hoping someone would give me some advice about making a slider, or maybe suggest a plugin
[07:30:14] <xec_> hombretao: depends what you mean by slider, but you could look at http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/ or http://jqueryui.com/slider/
[07:32:08] <hombretao> xec_ i must take the filenames of the images inside a directory with php, pass them as a json encoded array to the jquery plugin in order to preload the images as they are being displayed
[07:32:41] <hombretao> does this make sense or there a better aproach to have an image slider with lots of images with impacting pageload as little as posible?
[07:33:24] <houman> Hi, If I have a <td id='X'> <div> ... </div> </td>   How do I get the child div only? $('#X div')  this gives me all div children inside #X.
[07:34:19] <xec_> hombretao: i don't think you would need a js array of image urls to make them lazy load
[07:35:00] <xec_> hombretao: check out http://reallysimpleworks.com/slideshow/ <-- seems to have lazy loading built in
[07:35:18] <hombretao> ok, im cheking
[07:37:56] <xenome> is there a simple way to make the entire footer region a touch button?
[07:38:17] <xenome> i don't really want to show the button really, just make the entire region tigger a button like action
[07:40:09] <xec_> xenome: sure, but from a usability standpoint i feel an invisible button would be confusing rather than helpful? :)
[07:42:22] <xenome> well I changed the footer text to: Touch Region To Blah..
[07:44:26] <xec_> xenome: ok... so what you're basically asking is how to attach a click handler to an element?
[07:44:33] <xenome> yessir
[07:44:54] <xec_> $('.selector').click(function(){ ... })
[07:45:33] <xenome> and just pass that the id of my footer?
[07:45:54] <xec_> yes basically
[07:45:57] <xec_> then again, for touch you might actually want something else, i havent done any mobile-specific dev
[07:46:14] <xenome> ok, I"ll play with it
[07:46:23] <xec_> maybe something like $("#footerID").on("click, touchstart", function...)
[07:46:53] <xenome> perhaps you can help me with one other thing...I'm a bit confused on getting the CSS correct...to change button sizes i had to call jquery functions
[07:47:03] <xec_> but that might trigger twice? not sure
[07:47:08] <xenome> i figured I should be able to do that all in the css, but it didn't seem to work
[07:47:45] <xenome> $('.control_button').children().children().css("font-size", 20px)
[07:47:54] <xec_> xenome: yeah you should be able to size a button with css
[07:48:06] <xenome> was what I ended having to to do to change the size of a JQM button
[07:48:45] <xec_> also, font-size is inherited so you shouldn't need those .children() calls there, unless the styles are overridden on a descendant
[07:49:13] <xec_> xenome: but i'd have to see the code in action to tell for sure
[07:50:33] <xenome> maybe it's easier for me to just back up....if I want to change the size of a button I figured I need to target the font-size and padding attributes
[07:50:41] <xenome> this is on JQM btw
[07:56:50] <xec_> xenome: sorry i don't have experience with jq mobile personally
[08:15:44] <LearnerJq> any good sliding boxes/animated captions plugins...currently i am looking into MOSAIC...
[08:27:48] <LearnerJq> any good sliding boxes/animated captions plugins...currently i am looking into MOSAIC...

[10:00:15] <woopwoop> having this issue where IE9 can't seem to maintain aspect-ratio of a canvas while it works in every other browser. anyone know of a jquery solution?
[10:11:25] <Cronoh> can anyone see an issue with this? if ($('div.chat_line').length() > 10) { $('div.chat_line').first().remove(); }  I get SCRIPT5002: Function expected in IE9
[10:12:03] <shoky> Cronoh: length isn't a function
[10:12:20] <Cronoh> ah
[10:12:22] <Cronoh> thanks
[10:21:41] <eugene42> Hi there
[10:22:32] <eugene42> I'm using $.getJSON to get a json object from a PHP file, how can i get the number of objects being returned?
[10:24:35] <karolyi> Object.keys(returnedobject).length
[10:28:00] <eugene42> Thank you, just seems to return 1 every time
[10:30:29] <karolyi> eugene42: depends on how your object is structured
[10:30:30] <eugene42> http://pastebin.com/W86s26p9 See here. What I'm trying to do is show that three employees are being returned in the first example, and only one in the second how can I do that?
[10:31:38] <karolyi> eugene42: returnedobject['employees'].length
[10:35:39] <eugene42> Thanks that works, if I was to be more dynamic though, and I didnt know the tags name would I just access it like an array for example returnedobject['0'].length
[10:37:14] <karolyi> eugene42: only if it would hve a '0' key
[10:37:56] <eugene42> what if you didnt know the key?
[10:38:41] <karolyi> eugene42: then there's Object.keys() or you can iterate it through with a for cycle
[10:39:44] <karolyi> eugene42: numbered keys are only for arrays, not string indexed objects ("dictionaries, as it would have been called in the python world)
[10:41:25] <eugene42> thanks for the advice
[10:41:31] <eugene42> got it all sorted :D
[10:56:58] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i try: $('#myiframe')[0].contentDocument.body.find('#timeline')[0].scrollTop;  firebug shows me:  $(...)[0].contentDocument.body.find is not a function   .. what am i doing wrong??
[10:59:09] <karolyi> Krambiorix: do you have more #myiframe's?
[10:59:26] <Krambiorix> karolyi, no, just one
[10:59:59] <karolyi> Krambiorix: then you won't need [0], and i guess you also won't need contentDocument.body. just simply use find
[11:04:08] <Krambiorix> karolyi, $('#myiframe').find('#timeline').scrollTop()  -> the timeline works, but the scrollTop returns null
[11:04:18] <hip2p> I have an html table, each row with an email and a name. I want to use jquery jeditable on each field. My issue is that jeditable only sends an ID and the edited content to the php server. If I edit person 1's email, it'll send an ID. If I edit person 1's name, it'll send another ID.. Part of me wants to make both the email and name the same ID.
[11:05:22] <karolyi> Krambiorix: should it return anything else?
[11:06:40] <onebitxajax> hi to all
[11:07:14] <onebitxajax> $(window).load(function()  on chrome don't wait untill all images are finish loading , why?
[11:07:55] <karolyi> onebitxajax: because it's the domready event, not the 'allcontentloaded' event
[11:08:29] <onebitxajax> karolyi: how can i fire 'allcontentloaded' ?
[11:08:38] <karolyi> hip2p: i'm not sure i understand what you're trying to achieve
[11:10:01] <hip2p> karolyi, I have a table with columns Name and Email. The table is populated dynamically by PHP / MySQL. At any given time, I want to be able to click on an email or name and edit them. I have jeditable in place to do this, however jeditable only sends the element ID and changed data to the server.
[11:11:11] <karolyi> onebitxajax: try something like here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9862182/on-page-load-event-in-chrome-extensions
[11:12:03] <karolyi> hip2p: you mean the id attribute of the <td>?
[11:12:11] <hip2p> yea
[11:12:24] <onebitxajax> karolyi: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/544993/official-way-to-ask-jquery-wait-for-all-images-to-load-before-executing-somethin
[11:12:31] <Krambiorix> karolyi, sorry , i meant : $('#myiframe').find('#timeline').position().top ;
[11:12:39] <hip2p> It seems like I have to make an ID for each MySQL entry, and then for each email, the ID would look like "email101" and then for each name, the ID would look like "name101". And then when I edit a name, jeditable would send to the server ID=name101, and then I'd have to separate the name and the 101, then look up ID 101 in the database and edit the name...
[11:12:40] <onebitxajax> karolyi: the most voted answer With jQuery, you use $(document).ready() to execute something when the DOM is loaded and $(window).load() to execute something when all other things are loaded as well, such as the images.
[11:13:47] <karolyi> onebitxajax: are you able to reproduce that in jsfiddle? it can be a browser bug too
[11:16:54] <karolyi> Krambiorix: if you dump positon()'s result, what do you get?
[11:18:27] <onebitxajax> karolyi: http://jsfiddle.net/azrKx/
[11:18:34] <karolyi> hip2p: i think the reason for that functionality is that you might have non-unique emails/names in the table
[11:18:54] <Krambiorix> karolyi, undefined, the #timeline is a <hr/>
[11:19:28] <karolyi> Krambiorix: you need the position for a hr element?
[11:19:57] <karolyi> onebitxajax: works for me, which version of chrome are you using?
[11:19:57] <Krambiorix> karolyi, yes, the y pos
[11:20:42] <karolyi> Krambiorix: try to embed it within a span/div element
[11:21:22] <onebitxajax> karolyi: works either form me, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm why it not work on my site :/
[11:22:37] <karolyi> onebitxajax: if it ain't reproducable at jsfiddle, i think i can't help you
[11:23:07] <onebitxajax> karolyi: yes i know, thanks very much
[11:27:40] <rindolf> Hi all. http://www.shlomifish.org/__Beta-kmor/humour.html - in this page I am trying to get $('#nav_menu').tree( ... ) to collapse all nodes by default but nothing that I tried has worked. Can anyone help? I tried autoOpen : false ; autoOpen: true with 0 , -1 and 100 - nothing.
[11:27:44] <rindolf> Thanks in advance.
[11:30:22] <karolyi> rindolf: Note as of April 2010: While the plugin still works as it is, it has some shortcomings, and not maintained anymore. There are now plenty of alternative jQuery tree plugins, like jsTree. Eventually there will be successor as part of jQuery UI.
[11:31:38] <rindolf> karolyi: I'm using jqTree which is still maintained.
[11:32:03] <rindolf> karolyi: http://mbraak.github.com/jqTree/
[11:32:16] <rindolf> karolyi: I'm in the process of converting it from jq Treeview to jqTree.
[11:33:22] <rindolf> karolyi: so you've misread.
[11:34:07] <rindolf> karolyi: this is the code that does the magic - http://www.shlomifish.org/__Beta-kmor/js/to-jqtree-2.js
[11:42:44] <karolyi> ?demo @rindolf
[11:42:44] <bot-t> rindolf, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:47:01] <rindolf> karolyi: OK. I gave a link to the site.
[11:47:20] <rindolf> karolyi: but I guess I can try to isolate it.
[11:47:32] <rindolf> Not on jsfiddle.net though - too many deps.
[11:47:51] <Krambiorix> karolyi, i made a div of the hr to find the top pos: $('#myframe').find('#timeline').length    , length is 0
[11:48:05] <karolyi> rindolf: you can include external libraries on jsfiddle too
[11:48:26] <rindolf> karolyi: OK, I have my own web hosting for that.
[11:48:42] <karolyi> Krambiorix: that means, the id is nout found then
[11:49:01] <karolyi> -u
[11:51:19] <Krambiorix> karolyi, there is an element with that id in that iframe
[11:51:22] <erisco> I need a lightbox that will allow me to show a DOM element... all the ones I've seen have only worked with hrefs
[11:52:05] <karolyi> Krambiorix: i suggest to recreate the problem on jsfiddle, so i can help further
[12:13:29] <Aagam_> following is my code for jquery that I have added to my html file....The problem is that white space is show at the bottom of the page...
[12:13:32] <Aagam_> http://pastebin.com/RXtdesXt
[12:15:05] <Aagam_> please Helpp...
[12:17:53] <sadtaco> What do you call "example.org" that differentiates it from "sub.example.org"?
[12:20:41] <Hapzzz> how do i preventDefault of an a href?
[12:20:48] <Hapzzz> like, "don't go there"
[12:21:09] <Cronoh> preventDefault();
[12:21:12] <karolyi> Hapzzz: bind a function to the click event, and then event.preventDefault()
[12:21:34] <rindolf> karolyi: and all - http://www.shlomifish.org/jqTree-SNAFU-1/humour.html - this is better.
[12:21:59] <rindolf> I can reproduce it even further though, but release early release often.
[12:24:28] <rindolf> s/reproduce/reduce/
[12:24:45] <rindolf> Freudian.
[12:25:35] <karolyi> ?demo @Aagam_
[12:25:35] <bot-t> Aagam_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:26:47] <Aagam_> karolyi, bot-t  --please check this -   www.daiictngo.appspot.com
[12:29:27] <Krambiorix> karolyi, i found it but now i want to scroll inside a div: $('#myframe').contents().find('#slotscroller').scrollTop(scrollPosition);     -This doesn't work, btw  $('#myframe').contents().find('#slotscroller').length is 1   .
[12:32:19] <Aagam_> karolyi, bot-t  ... any bug found???
[12:33:17] <rindolf> Hmmm... it may be a CSS problem.
[12:34:22] <Aagam_> talkin to me rindolf ??
[12:34:50] <rindolf> Aagam_: no, to myself.
[12:35:01] <rindolf> karolyi: I think I missed some CSS styles.
[12:35:15] <rindolf> karolyi: thanks for your help.
[12:35:55] <karolyi> rindolf: i think there's an error in jqtree. as i debugged the code, i found that the max_level variable (its value is set from parsing the autoOpen setting) is not used anywhere else. jqutree is made with coffeescript, and as that, quite hard to read the generated JS code
[12:37:37] <karolyi> Aagam_: state your problem more precise please
[12:38:11] <rindolf> karolyi: working now, thanks.
[12:38:41] <Aagam_> Basically I am getting white space at the bottom of the page when I write the JQuery...
[12:42:01] <karolyi> Aagam_: there is a span element in the page, right before the closing <body> element, that one is causing the 'whitespace'
[12:42:48] <karolyi> Krambiorix: are you waiting until the dom is ready in your iframe?
[12:43:11] <Krambiorix> karolyi, yes
[12:43:41] <karolyi> Krambiorix: do you have a test page to show?
[12:44:13] <Krambiorix> karolyi, hmm not really
[12:45:15] <Aagam_> karolyi, i removed "span"...still white space not goinf
[12:45:18] <Aagam_> *going
[12:48:00] <karolyi> Aagam_: they're still there, two of them actually. you need to comment yout your script tags one by one, to see which one generates the span tags there
[12:49:19] <Aagam_> karolyi, see basically when I check website by firebug ;it shows span element...but when you see the code and if i remove the span element..than still it shows....
[12:52:02] <karolyi> Aagam_: like i said, there's two span elements
[12:52:16] <karolyi> *there are
[12:55:07] <aagam94> karolyi, this is my code - http://pastebin.com/hpZccitM....where do you find span ..please tell me
[12:55:48] <rindolf> karolyi: working nicely now - http://www.shlomifish.org/__Beta-kmor/ - thanks!
[12:56:36] <karolyi> rindolf: you're welcome. however, the images should be '+'-s before the links
[12:57:01] <rindolf> karolyi: I know - it's a known bug.
[12:57:07] <rindolf> karolyi: this is not the permanent site.
[12:57:14] <rindolf> karolyi: I'll work on it a bit more.
[12:57:37] <rindolf> karolyi: but at  least one problem was solved.
[12:57:52] <karolyi> aagam94: it's not your code what puts the spans there, it's an external jquery code you include. thatswhy i suggested commenting them out one by one, to see when does the unnecessary span elements disappear
[12:58:25] <aagam94> i am using modernizer.js and jquery.js
[12:58:36] <rindolf> karolyi++
[12:59:03] <aagam94> karolyi, buy both files are large enough to check ... :(
[12:59:15] <karolyi> rindolf: i'm not an official supporter here, so i guess you can't ++ me :)
[12:59:42] <rindolf> karolyi: are you immutable?
[12:59:46] <coldhead> you've as much right to a post increment as anyone karolyi
[13:00:04] <rindolf> karolyi: well, there may be some karma bots here.
[13:00:16] <karolyi> rindolf: hope so

[13:37:42] <sheilablackrose> Hi guys. I have a table called docs. its row has a column. is there away to do something like as long as one checkbox is checked do this function
[13:45:15] <karolyi> sheilablackrose: xcuse me?
[13:45:33] <xrdodrx> why doesn't this work?: $('td').on('click',function(){$(this).select()});
[13:46:25] <karolyi> xrdodrx: you can't select a td
[13:46:34] <coldhead> ?select
[13:46:34] <bot-t> .select(handler): Bind an event handler to the "select" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/select/
[13:46:49] <xrdodrx> i'm sorry, you can't? huh
[13:46:49] <karolyi> xrdodrx: The select event is sent to an element when the user makes a text selection inside it. This event is limited to <input type="text"> fields and <textarea> boxes.
[13:46:57] <xrdodrx> didn't know that :)
[13:47:04] <rabx> me neither :)
[13:47:06] <xrdodrx> would it be possible to select the text inside the td?
[13:47:37] <karolyi> xrdodrx: only if it's in an input element
[13:47:48] <rabx> can you give the td a class and then select that the class?
[13:48:13] <xrdodrx> karolyi: i see websites use this feature quite often, i'll have to find one and inspect it further
[13:48:16] <xrdodrx> it makes copying easier
[13:48:37] <karolyi> xrdodrx: for example?
[13:48:44] <sheilablackrose> sorry my explanation is bad. i have a table class docs. each row of the table has a checkbox.(its a dynamic table so the rows depend on the db). is there away that as long as 1 checkbox is checked i want to call a function
[13:50:21] <karolyi> sheilablackrose: on which event do you want to call that function?
[13:50:31] <rabx> When updating jquery from 1.5.3 to 1.8.1 my menu stopped working. I receive v.easing[this.easing] is not a function. I dont see "v.easing" nor "this.easing" in the source code.
[13:50:44] <sheilablackrose> as long as a user check a checkbox
[13:54:59] <Eviltwin> rabx: It's in the jQuery 1.8.1 source in Tween.prototype.run
[13:55:00] <karolyi> sheilablackrose: you can use $('#tableid input[type=checkbox]').is(':checked') for checking
[13:55:18] <rabx> oh, I think I know what the issue is
[13:55:46] <karolyi> sheilablackrose: if one of the resulting checkboxes is selected, it will return true
[13:56:22] <sheilablackrose> yeah
[13:56:35] <sheilablackrose> but err
[13:56:36] <sheilablackrose> like
[13:56:46] <sheilablackrose> will it continuously check the state of the checkbox?
[13:57:29] <sheilablackrose> like in c# we have like a checkbox event so it doesnt matter when as long as u checkthe checkbox i can do something. kinda same concept
[13:57:47] <sheilablackrose> so basically the user cn check the box anytime
[13:58:00] <hunterp> Why is this appending ugly? http://jsfiddle.net/uGyTB/1/
[13:58:27] <karolyi> sheilablackrose: you should bind the click event of the checkboxes to the checker function, i created an example for you: http://jsfiddle.net/CRZsF/
[13:58:49] <sheilablackrose> thank you karolyi - ill study it now
[14:01:19] <karolyi> hunterp: because jquery initializes a lot of css classes to the original LI element, which cannot be done to the appended LI element
[14:02:09] <karolyi> thy shall have patience
[14:03:13] <sheilablackrose> karolyi - http://jsfiddle.net/CRZsF/2/   i tried that it doesnt work. Also how does the code know its meant for checkbox?
[14:03:35] <sheilablackrose> sorry it works
[14:04:05] <karolyi> sheilablackrose: it's bound to the click event of any found input elements
[14:04:16] <sheilablackrose> so $('input') it like for any element?
[14:04:18] <sheilablackrose> oh yeah
[14:04:24] <sheilablackrose> can i specify like only checkbox
[14:04:25] <sheilablackrose> ?
[14:04:33] <sheilablackrose> n also run the function only ones?
[14:04:50] <karolyi> sheilablackrose: you can use CSS selectors
[14:05:32] <sheilablackrose> googling now
[14:14:43] <rudiX> in case var data is some 'html bla <div id="test">content</div> other ...'
[14:14:59] <rudiX> how to get the html inside <div id="data">
[14:16:56] <karolyi> $('#data').html()
[14:18:13] <rudiX> karolyi:  its not div but variable
[14:18:32] <rudiX> via $.get('somepage.html'
[14:19:49] <karolyi> rudiX: then you can create a dom object list in jquery with initializing the variable as an HTML: var parsedHtml = $(variable) . Then you can use jQuery functions on the parsedHtml variable
[14:20:21] <rudiX> yeah thats what i've tried  - var test = $(data +'#'+lang).html();
[14:20:30] <karolyi> huh?
[14:21:30] <rudiX> <div id="bg"> bg </div> <div id="en"> english </div>
[14:21:36] <rudiX> the contents from html
[14:21:50] <rudiX> it returns only "bg"
[14:22:26] <rudiX> var test = $(data +'#en').html();
[14:22:33] <rudiX> still -> bg
[14:22:48] <karolyi> rudiX: you need to create a root element
[14:23:05] <karolyi> rudiX: put the string into a <div></div>
[14:23:20] <rudiX> can you provide example
[14:23:39] <karolyi> $('<div><div id="bg"> bg </div> <div id="en"> english </div></div>')
[14:25:30] <Whirl3d> Hey guys, what is the name of a site that lets you donate money to programmers for their help....like buy them a beer or something?
[14:26:19] <karolyi> dunno but i could use it :)
[14:26:52] <rudiX> y not paypal
[14:27:53] <Whirl3d> besides the fact that paypal is downright evil, you have to have a paypal account and this guy who has helped me doesn't have a paypal account.
[14:28:10] <Whirl3d> Im gonna checkout Dwolla...maybe they can help.
[14:29:45] <rudiX> other services still use paypal ... just wraps the button to look more fancy
[14:31:26] <Whirl3d> Dwolla is a lot cheaper, faster, and less hassle and works with Facebook and twitter. NICE
[14:36:04] <R00tk3y> Where can I get all of the data information that is stored within function(e)
[14:36:17] <karolyi> R00tk3y: explain
[14:36:21] <R00tk3y> e.type
[14:36:28] <R00tk3y> Where can I get more information on what it stores
[14:36:40] <R00tk3y> like e.(I want to know my options);
[14:36:54] <karolyi> e is an event obviously then
[14:36:59] <R00tk3y> Yes
[14:37:04] <karolyi> you should take a look at the javascript event object
[14:37:12] <R00tk3y> Okay
[14:39:48] <oojacoboo> so, I have a click event, it's a container, I want to return if an anchor is clicked within this container, as opposed to firing the rest of the event's function
[14:40:08] <oojacoboo> currently, I'm doing if(event.target == $("a")) return;
[14:40:13] <oojacoboo> of course, that's not working correctly
[14:40:28] <oojacoboo> any ideas?
[14:40:41] <wroathe> oojacoboo: Post code
[14:40:45] <oojacoboo> lol
[14:40:53] <oojacoboo> anyone else?
[14:41:00] <karolyi> oojacoboo: event.target.is('a')
[14:41:06] <oojacoboo> thanks KA_
[14:41:13] <oojacoboo> karolyi: **
[14:42:11] <karolyi> might be that you'd need $(event.target).is('a'), not sure
[14:42:18] <oojacoboo> haha, yep ;)
[14:42:21] <oojacoboo> just found that out
[14:43:10] <oojacoboo> not sure why I can't ever remember the is() method
[14:43:15] <oojacoboo> such a great one
[14:43:30] <karolyi> it comes handy sometimes
[14:43:35] <oojacoboo> def
[15:00:26] <R00tk3y> With e.target
[15:00:34] <R00tk3y> I cant use it to set the this
[15:00:40] <R00tk3y> That made no sense lol
[15:02:08] <R00tk3y> e.target doesn't refer to the this?
[15:02:31] <R00tk3y> on .change
[15:02:48] <karolyi> R00tk3y: e.target is a dom element, not a javascript object
[15:04:06] <R00tk3y> Correct
[15:04:32] <R00tk3y> So I cant get the self pointer?
[15:04:49] <karolyi> R00tk3y: pointing to what exactly?
[15:05:06] <R00tk3y> When using .change
[15:05:17] <R00tk3y> I want to change the background color of the form element that was changed
[15:05:56] <karolyi> on which event?
[15:06:41] <R00tk3y> var this = event.target
[15:07:12] <R00tk3y> $('form').change(function(e) {    });
[15:08:15] <karolyi> $('form').change(function(e) { $(this).css('background', 'black')});
[15:09:27] <R00tk3y> Nah
[15:09:36] <anew> anyone know how you can get a 404 for a post request from ajax, but the xhr request goes thru ?
[15:09:37] <R00tk3y> Changes the whole form to black, which makes sense
[15:09:52] <R00tk3y> Maybe I cant get the element on the form that was changed
[15:10:30] <karolyi> R00tk3y: $('form').change(function(e) { $(e.target).css('background', 'black')});
[15:10:35] <karolyi> but i'm not sure
[15:11:02] <karolyi> anew: excuse me?
[15:11:35] <anew> karolyi, in console.  the xhr request looks like it goes thru.  but the 'post' right before it returns 404
[15:11:37] <anew> weird as hell
[15:11:40] <R00tk3y> Karolyi, that worked!
[15:11:51] <R00tk3y> Weird it didnt work when I put it in  var $this = e.target;
[15:11:52] <R00tk3y> :\
[15:12:15] <karolyi> R00tk3y: 'this' is a javascript keyword, not writeable
[15:12:47] <karolyi> anew: thats weird indeed
[15:17:39] <oojacoboo> is there a way to get the css value of the non :hover state?
[15:17:44] <karolyi> R00tk3y: just to note, the change event is not originating from the form element, it is bubbling up from the input field: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onchange.asp
[15:18:35] <oojacoboo> I'm using this currentlyâ€¦ 			originalBackground = this.css("background-color");
[15:18:55] <oojacoboo> but the issue is that :hover state is triggered sometimes, and it grabs the background-color of that
[15:19:09] <oojacoboo> I want the element's background-color without the :hover value
[15:22:15] <karolyi> oojacoboo: in my opinion you have to create a dom element with the same classes, and then fetch the values from there (set display:none so no :hover can occur)
[15:22:23] <anew> http://i.imgur.com/CU7NP.jpg anyone know how the hell this is possible - it's the same url.  the post request is 404, but the xhr works?
[15:22:33] <oojacoboo> karolyi: I was afraid of that...
[15:22:37] <oojacoboo> hacky :(
[15:22:55] <oojacoboo> I could also look it up with document.styleSheets
[15:23:04] <oojacoboo> but that sucks too
[15:25:27] <karolyi> oojacoboo: well you could also set display:none opn that particular dom element while you fetch the css value
[15:25:37] <tw2113> oojacoboo, what event are you doing this on?
[15:26:12] <oojacoboo> var $element = $(this).clone(); var background = $element.css("background-color"); bingo
[15:26:36] <tw2113> my suggest was going to be grab the bg color into a var before dealing with anything else with it
[15:27:00] <karolyi> anew: are you logging the succes event on the second debug line? or the done event
[15:27:01] <oojacoboo> tw2113: that would be nice in theory, but this is a jQuery.fn
[15:27:04] <Determinist> question: when doing this: $('#someID', 'some context'), would that limit the scope of the search to the context or just do doc.getElementById? As far as I can tell, there's no element.getElementById(...), and IDs are global to the document. correct?
[15:27:21] <anew> karolyi i have console.log inside succes, but it never appears.
[15:27:45] <anew> but the db is getting updates, and if u expand each url in console - they both use the same ajax fn
[15:27:46] <anew> so weird
[15:29:16] <karolyi> Determinist: i think you better do a lookup for yourself on the jquery source with this issue
[15:29:29] <ilian> Hi
[15:29:39] <Determinist> karolyi: already doing that, was just wondering if somebody could save me the time.
[15:29:50] <ilian> is there a way to user relative selection in autocomplete's appendTo?
[15:30:08] <karolyi> anew: so, what does emit the "XHR finished loading" line?
[15:30:29] <anew> what do you mean?
[15:30:35] <ngharo> chrome does
[15:30:46] <karolyi> you dont say
[15:31:00] <ngharo> right click console, xhr logging
[15:31:29] <ngharo> maybe the script throws a 404 header upon POST
[15:32:38] <anew> ngharo yes i have xhr logging already enabled
[15:32:57] <anew> the post header is 404, but there is a response ....
[15:33:11] <neteffect> hello
[15:35:43] <karolyi> anew: so you have bound functions to the error and success callbacks too?
[15:36:15] <anew> to the success yes
[15:36:16] <R00tk3y> Is there a way to prevent tabbing from tabbing outside of the popup box
[15:36:53] <karolyi> R00tk3y: set tabindex='-1' to the outmost element
[15:37:03] <R00tk3y> Thank you
[15:37:47] <karolyi> anew: and what would be the behavior you expect?
[15:38:58] <anew> karolyi no 404 !
[15:39:02] <anew> it's supposed to change some divs

[15:39:29] <oojacoboo> tw2113: https://gist.github.com/4314255
[15:39:38] <oojacoboo> I decided to go with transparent, solves the issue all around
[15:39:49] <oojacoboo> still having problems removing the style attr after the fact though
[15:40:23] <oojacoboo> I've gotta have it removed so the :hover state, etc will work, it leaves the style attr in place with opacity set to 0
[15:40:27] <neteffect> hi i wnat to use this: $('a[title="Show Profile"]').contents().unwrap();        but can i search for it by the link?  not the title?
[15:40:42] <tw2113> a[href=""]
[15:40:46] <neteffect> oh ok
[15:41:32] <karolyi> anew: but 404 is a common http error, so if you need your response not handled as an error, you should emit another response code
[15:41:49] <forever1o6> i hate jquery ;(
[15:42:06] <gdoteof> is there a way to determine *which* submit button was hit (if there are multiple) when using .submit() ?
[15:42:08] <anew> karolyi 'not handled as an error' what do u mean ?
[15:42:13] <min|dvir|us-work> forever1o6: nobody cares.
[15:42:36] <karolyi> anew: if i get it right, your problem is that your response is handled as an error
[15:42:55] <gdoteof> i have some code i need to fix that assumes only one submit button; so its trying to do an async request at the wrong time when someone hits the "previous page" form
[15:42:57] <anew> yes
[15:43:01] <gdoteof> er, the previous page button
[15:43:22] <gdoteof> http://pastebin.com/B3cX8Ptg
[15:43:26] <karolyi> anew: well that's because of the 404, it's handled as an error by all browsers
[15:43:41] <neteffect> tw2113 thank you, i am noob so i might ask dumb stuff fromt time to time
[15:43:59] <coldhead> dumb stuff is AOK
[15:44:15] <min|dvir|us-work> Anyone use jQuery UI?
[15:44:27] <anew> karolyi ah ok - no not exactly the problem  the problem is why am i getting a 404 here?
[15:44:34] <anew> afaik it should be 200
[15:45:00] <karolyi> anew: can you dump the headers of that request?
[15:45:38] <anew> the response headers ?
[15:45:43] <karolyi> anew: yes
[15:46:43] <anew> karolyi http://pastebin.com/PjyDp2M9
[15:47:12] <karolyi> anew: that's too few, we need the response code too
[15:47:56] <anew> that's it
[15:47:59] <anew> there isnt anything else
[15:48:09] <astropirate> The Ajax page on the jquery site says that PUT and DELETE aren't supported by all browsers. What browsers don't support them?
[15:48:13] <min|dvir|us-work> Using jQuery UI sortable, but it's not working. Can anyone take a look? http://tinkerbin.com/8U1apTjG
[15:50:06] <karolyi> anew: you'll need to use curl or wget or some external command line tool to fetch all headers, there's more
[15:50:30] <oojacoboo> anyone have any idea why the removeAttribute isn't working? https://gist.github.com/4314334
[15:51:23] <anew> bleh.. i'll just change the divs with an error response - easier than figuring out the 404 since it's returning the result anyway
[15:51:32] <karolyi> oojacoboo: depends ot what is the result of this.get(0), but i think you meant removeAttr
[15:51:52] <oojacoboo> karolyi: that wasn't working, so I was trying bypassing jquery
[15:52:05] <karolyi> oojacoboo: dump the result of this.get(0)
[15:52:21] <oojacoboo> karolyi: I don't see why that's an issue
[15:52:37] <oojacoboo> I mean, the animate is working on that object...
[15:52:38] <karolyi> oojacoboo: it might not even be a jquery object
[15:52:48] <oojacoboo> karolyi: it's a $.fn
[15:52:52] <oojacoboo> and it is...
[15:53:50] <karolyi> astropirate: they are supported by chrome/firefox but keep in mind that some proxies are blocking them, so it might not depend on the browser support
[15:54:24] <astropirate> karolyi, ahh I see. thanks
[15:57:23] <karolyi> oojacoboo: what does this.get(0) do in your code?
[15:58:10] <karolyi> gdoteof: i suggest disabling all buttons while async requests are running
[16:04:17] <oojacoboo> karolyi: you're right, this changes within the context of animate
[16:04:44] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/HpaPN/2/

[16:10:34] <karolyi> you're missing a space in the selector
[16:10:47] <karolyi> '#score_sof.ratings_stars' should be '#score_sof .ratings_stars'
[16:10:51] <tw2113> ^
[16:10:51] <smftre> right
[16:11:18] <smftre> thanks, thought I had tried that..

[16:20:31] <karolyi> min|dvir|us-work: i don't know popover but might be that the content you initialized, gets copied without the corresponding events
[16:21:53] <shoky> min|dvir|us-work: yep that's it..
[16:21:54] <min|dvir|us-work> karolyi: that's what I'm thinking.
[16:22:31] <min|dvir|us-work> I don't see a way around it...
[16:22:36] <shoky> it's just copying the .html()
[16:24:07] <karolyi> min|dvir|us-work: if there's an oninit event to the popover, you could init the sortable there
[16:40:08] <DukeDrake> hi
[16:43:16] <DukeDrake> is it possible to iterate a javascript object with access to the key strings?
[16:43:51] <DukeDrake> with jQuery.each(obj, function(i, val) {} );   i will be the numerical index ... but I need the string
[16:44:13] <min|dvir|us-work> DukeDrake: obj in your case is an array, not an object.
[16:44:30] <min|dvir|us-work> (Well, arrays are objects, but that's your problem.)
[16:45:56] <aleray> hi, I have a nested structure of elements with the same attribute, how can I find all the first-level elements (and discard the child elements with the same attribute)?
[16:46:07] <karolyi> DukeDrake: what string?
[16:46:53] <Imaginativeone> how do I run a function as a result of a button-tap?
[16:46:58] <DukeDrake> min|dvir|us-work: errr ... that's what I said, no?
[16:47:00] <karolyi> aleray: $('selector').eq(0)
[16:47:43] <DukeDrake> like var obj = [ { 'key' : 'value' }, { 'otherkey' : 'othervalue' } ];
[16:48:15] <min|dvir|us-work> $.each(objs, function (i, obj) { console.log(obj.key); });
[16:48:26] <aleray> karolyi, yes, but there might be several elements at the first-level?
[16:49:02] <karolyi> aleray: eq(0) will take the first element of the list, and the list will be sorted in order to the dom element list
[16:49:15] <karolyi> *according to
[16:49:42] <karolyi> DukeDrake: and you need key and otherkey as strings?
[16:50:20] <DukeDrake> karolyi: yes. As in the php foreach( obj as $key => $value)
[16:50:40] <aleray> karolyi, sorry I probably explain it the wrong way. Let say my body have to two divs with attr "data-foo". Those two divs might have child with same attr-foo. I want to get the two parents div but not their child.
[16:50:50] <DukeDrake> min|dvir|us-work: you're getting it wrong :/
[16:51:00] <rindolf> http://www.shlomifish.org/__Beta-kmor/ - hi all. Here (tested in close-to-latest Opera, Firefox and Google Chromium on Mageia Linux 3 Cauldron), the expanders/[+] signs of the navigation menu on the left get shifted a little when the sub-menu is expanded. Why and how can it be avoided? Is it because of the different character in the text?
[16:51:06] <min|dvir|us-work> DukeDrake: if obj is what you said, I am not.
[16:51:11] <karolyi> DukeDrake: obj.forEach(function (element) {console.log(Object.keys(element)[0])})
[16:51:15] <aleray> karolyi, I could use css rules like  body > [attr-foo] but I don't know the document structure before end
[16:52:23] <DukeDrake> min|dvir|us-work: I "don't know" about obj.key and obj.otherkey yet. I need to get them with an iterator.
[16:52:28] <DukeDrake> karolyi: cool =)
[16:52:48] <oojacoboo> I'm curious, what are the benefits to using a closure over a function within a parent function?  Are there any really, aside from the necessity of a var?
[16:53:03] <DukeDrake> well ... if I understand what it's doing XD
[16:53:09] <min|dvir|us-work> DukeDrake: right, good luck with that.
[16:53:33] <DukeDrake> Object.keys(element)[0] ?
[16:53:53] <min|dvir|us-work> DukeDrake: all your objects should look the same.
[16:53:56] <karolyi> aleray: how do you mean you 'don't know the document structure before end'?
[16:54:08] <aleray> karolyi, it is for a wiki
[16:54:11] <min|dvir|us-work> DukeDrake: why do you have an array of objects?
[16:54:49] <karolyi> DukeDrake: Object.keys() returns the keys from an object in an array, [0] is the first element of that array, so you have your object key, according to your defined obj variable
[16:55:08] <DukeDrake> min|dvir|us-work: it's also called "associative array", i.e. has key-value pairs
[16:55:27] <min|dvir|us-work> DukeDrake: do you want help, or do you want to try to teach me something?
[16:55:35] <DukeDrake> karolyi: ok! I'll try that ^^
[16:55:42] <karolyi> aleray: you mean the to divs could be at different level of the dom structure?
[16:55:58] <aleray> karolyi, exactly
[16:56:06] <DukeDrake> min|dvir|us-work: I answered your question ...........
[16:56:15] <min|dvir|us-work> DukeDrake: no you didn't.
[16:56:22] <karolyi> aleray: hm, let me think
[16:56:43] <aleray> thxs
[17:00:38] <karolyi> aleray: i think you have to use the parent() selector, and check if the result is empty
[17:01:29] <DukeDrake> lol  ... Object.keys(obj)[0]  is "0"  .... %)
[17:01:44] <DukeDrake> (when it really is "key" ... )
[17:01:59] <karolyi> aleray:but you will need to create your own filter function for that, using parent() and a filter applied to it
[17:02:55] <karolyi> DukeDrake: what does Object.keys({a:1,b:2})[0] tell you?
[17:03:37] <min|dvir|us-work> FYI .keys() is not support across all browsers.
[17:03:38] <karolyi> aleray: get the idea?
[17:03:51] <min|dvir|us-work> Furthermore, .keys() has no explicit order, so [0] has arbitrary value.
[17:03:57] <karolyi> min|dvir|us-work: depends on JS version, but the most recent chrome/FF supports it
[17:04:01] <aleray> karolyi, I think so... won't it be slow?
[17:04:30] <karolyi> aleray: depends on the dom size of course, but i don't think there's a better way to do it
[17:04:53] <aleray> karolyi, thanks a lot, I look into it ;)
[17:05:08] <DukeDrake> a >.>
[17:05:20] <karolyi> min|dvir|us-work: no need for ordering when you only need the first element of a one-elemented object
[17:05:41] <min|dvir|us-work> karolyi: who said there's only one element?
[17:06:30] <DukeDrake> the order wouldn't matter
[17:07:01] * DukeDrake bangs his head against the wall ... why is it '0' when it really is 'key'?? -.-
[17:07:12] <DukeDrake> (or 'otherkey')
[17:07:19] <karolyi> DukeDrake: maybe your object is an array, not an obect
[17:07:22] <karolyi> *object
[17:07:29] <DukeDrake> ô.o
[17:08:56] <karolyi> DukeDrake: in my solution there was a forEach too for iterating through the array elements
[17:12:30] <DukeDrake> karolyi: yes, it's probably an array of objects
[17:14:22] <karolyi> DukeDrake: so i guess now you'll be able to get it right
[17:14:34] <DukeDrake> yupp =)
[17:14:43] <DukeDrake> Object.keys(obj[i])[0]   works ^^
[17:15:00] <DukeDrake> (with i being the index from each() )
[17:15:28] <karolyi> kinda the same as forEach, just with another approach
[17:16:36] <DukeDrake> yes ... umm =)
[17:16:41] <min|dvir|us-work> That's definitely world-class code.
[17:16:59] <DukeDrake> min|dvir|us-work: what do you mean?
[17:17:14] <min|dvir|us-work> I mean we've run into a case of the XY problem.
[17:19:16] <karolyi> its rather the XZY problem: X tries to help Y, Z criticizes
[17:19:48] <min|dvir|us-work> If you have an array of heterogeneous objects, you're doing it wrong.
[17:20:06] <min|dvir|us-work> Especially if you're trying to get keys out.
[17:20:42] <karolyi> min|dvir|us-work: you never know what for is it used, besides it could be that it's now his own code, he just has to find a workaround for it
[17:20:55] <DukeDrake> min|dvir|us-work: it's completey valid json, fyi ;)
[17:21:28] <karolyi> DukeDrake: although it's valid, i neither would use the same json construct
[17:22:27] <karolyi> s/now/not/
[17:22:28] <DukeDrake> it's really a jason string with an array for checkboxes, radio and textfields , which in turn contain the ids and values for the respective fields  .... though with radio and checkboxes the ids suffice, of course
[17:23:16] <karolyi> DukeDrake: and what do you put in the keys?
[17:23:33] <DukeDrake> hm?
[17:23:47] <DukeDrake> keys are the ids, the values are the ... values ...
[17:23:47] <min|dvir|us-work> DukeDrake: you'll thank me later.
[17:24:49] <karolyi> DukeDrake: i'd suggest to use [{id:"objectid",value:"fieldvalue"},{id:"objectid2",value:"fieldvalue2"}]
[17:25:23] <DukeDrake> heh ...
[17:25:38] <DukeDrake> I prefer intrinsic structure ^^
[17:25:54] <karolyi> DukeDrake: it's not just easier to understand, but easier to write a code for it
[17:26:05] <DukeDrake> not really
[17:26:21] <DukeDrake> ok, it's easier to write javascript code, alright
[17:26:26] <min|dvir|us-work> DukeDrake: how old are you?
[17:26:54] <tw2113> 109
[17:26:58] <tw2113> i heard a rumor
[17:27:51] <min|dvir|us-work> DukeDrake: karolyi is right.
[17:28:20] <karolyi> DukeDrake: as you wish, i'm just trying to help you out. later on when you have to read your own code, you might find difficulties to understand it
[17:28:37] <karolyi> (not to speak of others)
[17:29:58] <karolyi> DukeDrake: the target is to avoid spaghetti-code and obfuscatedly difficult looking code
[17:32:02] <mobile8> i'm hovering over something, and then just 1 sec when i still am hovered over it, i want some func to exec
[17:32:11] <mobile8> i dont want it to exec if i move away within 3 secs
[17:32:14] <mobile8> any idea how i can best do this?
[17:32:25] <DukeDrake> karolyi: well ... as php supports the key-value structure without explicitly denoting which of both is the 'key' and which is the 'value', but rather provides an easy to understand structure like $myarray['key'] = 'value'; I think, I'm fairly acquainted with the procedure and will not have difficulties, thank you ^^
[17:32:27] <neteffect> hi i wanna do something in jquery is it ok that javascript is on the page?
[17:32:33] <karolyi> mobile8: timeouts are your friends
[17:33:31] <tw2113> neteffect, it's all javascript in the end
[17:33:53] <mobile8> karolyi: any example?
[17:34:35] <karolyi> mobile8: start a timeout when hovering, and stop the timeout on the mouseout event, it's that easy
[17:35:05] <mobile8> ok
[17:35:07] <mobile8> lets see
[17:35:20] <mobile8> karolyi: setTimeout is what you mean right?
[17:35:25] <karolyi> mobile8: var timeoutid = setTimeout(doMyStuff, 1000), and execute a clearTimeout() on the mouseout
[17:35:35] <neteffect> here: http://pastebin.com/0EcPzfq4 i can get this to work on its own and stuff but when i try it on my wordpress blog, it wont get rid of a link i don't want on there
[17:35:43] <karolyi> mobile8: actually, clearTimeout(timeoutid)
[17:35:50] <neteffect> i am new so i litereally dont know where stuff is
[17:36:15] <neteffect> where do i put that code on the page?
[17:37:16] <mobile8> karolyi: ok thanks
[17:39:18] <karolyi> neteffect: there are slight differences between putting the script tag in the header and the body, but if you're not doing any heavy stuff, anywhere is fine, restructuring it makes the code looking better
[17:40:07] <neteffect> so my blog is calling a script from another site
[17:42:28] <neteffect> and theyre putting a link and i want to leave the text but take the link away
[17:45:28] <mobile8> karolyi: var timeoutid = setTimeout(function(){functionsomething()}, 1000);
[17:45:30] <mobile8> like this?
[17:45:41] <karolyi> mobile8: yup
[17:45:46] <mobile8> hmm doesn't work for me
[17:46:27] <mobile8> i mean it does alert
[17:46:31] <mobile8> but showing the item it doesnt
[17:46:54] <karolyi> mobile8: what item?
[17:48:01] <mobile8> nvm mistyped something sorry
[17:48:25] <veQue> http://css-tricks.com/color-fading-menu-with-jquery/ hey is jquery-color.js a common script that is used? or specifically made for this tut?
[17:48:47] <veQue> when you click downloaded files
[17:49:07] <tw2113> what would stop you from using it veQue ?
[17:49:25] <veQue> i guess i was curious of convention
[17:49:35] <veQue> but guess your point is very true
[17:50:08] <tw2113> Chris offers the files to download, i'd say that's cart blanche to use on your own
[17:50:48] <tw2113> neteffect, i just got that pastebin to work in jsbin.com
[17:51:17] <mobile8> $(this).closest("li")
[17:51:21] <mobile8> when i have something like
[17:51:26] <mobile8> <li><span><div><a>
[17:51:38] <mobile8> and I hover over <a> it should catch this <li> ?
[17:51:49] <imsky> maybe
[17:51:58] <mobile8> not in my case :L(
[17:52:48] <mobile8> any idea if there is a good alternative i can use
[17:52:50] <imsky> sure
[17:52:57] <imsky> $(this).parents("li")
[17:53:16] <karolyi> closest should also work
[17:54:04] <karolyi> <div>how to annow a web developer</span>
[17:54:11] <karolyi> <div>how to annoy a web developer</span>
[17:54:12] <neteffect> how come w hen i put in the script src line, the javascript stops working?
[17:54:28] <min|dvir|us-work> karolyi: very original.
[17:54:48] <tw2113> neteffect, i'd just put the script block right before the closing body tag personally
[17:55:17] <neteffect> k
[17:56:17] <neteffect> ah better, now to try their link :}
[17:56:40] <veQue> <div></div>
[17:57:26] * veQue twiddles' thumbs with no project
[17:57:30] <veQue> to work on
[17:57:39] <veQue> shame on me
[17:58:10] <karolyi> mobile8: maybe 'this' is not a html element, nor a jquery object with a html element in your code
[18:03:01] <DukeDrake> hmmm
[18:04:02] <DukeDrake> if I want to access a object value like myobj.somevar.myval  ... but "myval" is in a variable , how do I do that?
[18:04:27] <karolyi> myobj.somevar[variable]
[18:04:35] <DukeDrake> thanx
[18:09:32] <sheilablackrose> hi guys please correct this http://jsfiddle.net/CRZsF/5/
[18:10:24] <min|dvir|us-work> sheilablackrose: onClick is horrendous.
[18:10:52] <min|dvir|us-work> $('input[type="submit"]').click(function () { test(); });
[18:11:16] <sheilablackrose> ok let me try that
[18:11:49] <min|dvir|us-work> sheilablackrose: you have one extra curly brace at the end.
[18:12:07] <min|dvir|us-work> sheilablackrose: you should use a better editor, like Sublime Text.
[18:12:28] <neteffect> i want to remove a link off my page with javascript
[18:12:51] <tw2113> did you put your script block at the end of your body?
[18:13:11] <min|dvir|us-work> neteffect: that's all the info you're going to give?
[18:13:14] <neteffect> yes.  when the jquery loads, the javascript execution stops.  i dunno what i'm doing wrong.
[18:13:28] <sheilablackrose> ok testing it now
[18:13:30] <tw2113> do you have a link to the site?
[18:13:40] <min|dvir|us-work> $('[href="http://link.com/"]').remove();
[18:14:09] <sheilablackrose> still doesnt work
[18:14:23] <sheilablackrose> http://jsfiddle.net/CRZsF/6/
[18:16:22] <tw2113> neteffect,
[18:16:53] <min|dvir|us-work> sheilablackrose: you took out too much code.
[18:17:08] <min|dvir|us-work> You can't just remove what you think doesn't mean anything.
[18:17:16] <sheilablackrose> u men athe document ready?
[18:17:20] <min|dvir|us-work> Yes.
[18:18:13] <min|dvir|us-work> sheilablackrose: make sure your brackets match up. A decent editor will color mismatched brackets.
[18:22:05] <sheilablackrose> i think it the syntax http://jsfiddle.net/CRZsF/7/   basically im trying to get the value of each checkbox that is checked
[18:22:10] <sheilablackrose> i mean the id
[18:22:25] <sheilablackrose> the editor says ; missing
[18:24:03] <aqeel> hi room
[18:24:38] <aqeel> http://jailbreak.webege.com/js/plugins/aautoscroll.js
[18:25:02] <aqeel> i have successfully implemented the totop: and tobottom: methods...
[18:25:49] <aqeel> i would like to add few more but need better understanding of the flow, can some one guide me as where to look for the specific addition i am going to do..
[18:27:39] <aqeel> since as of now, the fastforward and rewind are functional and when assigned to click() will step once, i would like to add if mouse is down and not just click, but press and hold thus the fastforward or rewind should occur unless untill the mouse is released
[18:39:26] <sheilablackrose> can anyone help me with the syntax http://jsfiddle.net/CRZsF/7/
[18:42:05] <hugo_moss> whats wrong with the syntax
[18:45:50] <sheilablackrose> its asking for a ; near the each
[18:48:21] <tw2113> i don't think you have your .each() right
[18:48:39] <tw2113> $('#documents').each(':checkbox:checked',function() { var test = $(this).attr('id'); });
[18:49:39] <sheilablackrose> thanks let me study it abit
[18:51:28] <sheilablackrose> tw2113 http://jsfiddle.net/CRZsF/8/ it says callback.apply is not a function
[18:53:31] <tw2113> try http://jsfiddle.net/CRZsF/9/
[18:54:40] <oojacoboo> if I have a function I'm using globally to setup events, but I need to add to those events within a specific place, what's the best way of doing this?  I'm assuming through a callback, but how would you set that up exactly?
[18:54:50] <tw2113> i think you were originally trying to run $.each on the outer div
[18:54:56] <oojacoboo> callback.call(); no?
[18:56:04] <tw2113> keep the questions in here sheilablackrose
[18:56:10] <tw2113> no point in PM help
[18:57:04] <sheilablackrose> ok in the code you gave you are using the class in the input field right
[18:57:12] <sheilablackrose> is there away to use the docuents id instead
[18:57:21] <oojacoboo> tw2113: any ideas?  how would I do something likeâ€¦ $jqObj.method(param, function(event) {});  //how can I get event in that function passed?
[18:57:32] <tw2113> i'm not that much of a pro with jquery
[18:58:01] <oojacoboo> alrighty
[18:58:22] <oojacoboo> anyone? :)
[18:58:57] <oojacoboo> I guess I could just copy some jquery core code
[19:01:50] <oojacoboo> tw2113: looks like they're using .on()
[19:02:01] <oojacoboo> makes sense
[19:14:56] <sheilablackrose> how can  i say that in table documents, get all checkbox that is checked?
[19:16:03] <aqeel> mousedown is it the one when mouse is clicked and held
[19:17:21] <hugo_moss> sheilablackrose: "docs:checked"
[19:17:39] <hugo_moss> sheilablackrose: "input:checked"
[19:17:42] <hugo_moss> either
[19:18:54] <sheilablackrose> i did this var checked = $('#documents:checked');  that my table id
[19:21:46] <hugo_moss> i dont know if that works
[19:21:56] <hugo_moss> i think it has to be on input elements
[19:22:03] <hugo_moss> so make a class for all the inputs
[19:22:13] <hugo_moss> and do "class_name:checked"
[19:22:24] <sheilablackrose> ic
[19:22:24] <aqeel> no need
[19:22:45] <hugo_moss> im not sure, aqeel do you know
[19:23:04] <aqeel> what is the flow of your code
[19:23:15] <sheilablackrose> basically its a dynamic table each row has a checkbox
[19:23:21] <aqeel> table with id #documents
[19:23:23] <sheilablackrose> i want the id of the checkbox that is checked
[19:23:27] <sheilablackrose> yup
[19:23:34] <aqeel> and in each td there is a check box
[19:23:47] <sheilablackrose> yup
[19:24:00] <sheilablackrose> dynamic so i dontknow how many rows
[19:24:26] <aqeel> no need it will take into account all of them
[19:24:41] <sheilablackrose> so what do i do?
[19:27:42] <sheilablackrose> aqeel u there?
[19:27:50] <aqeel> yes wait
[19:28:20] <sheilablackrose> ok
[19:30:05] <aqeel> ok you got two properties
[19:30:31] <aqeel> #documents:checkbox will select all checkboxes in document
[19:30:38] <sheilablackrose> ok
[19:31:50] <aqeel> and #documents:checked ...checks for the state of checkbox.....looking if you can use two selectores together....though i not used myself as of yet....so i do not know about that
[19:32:24] <sheilablackrose> ic
[19:33:08] <sheilablackrose> can i do $(#documents:checkbox).find(#documents:checked)
[19:33:10] <sheilablackrose> ?
[19:37:46] <aqeel> $("#documents input[type='checkbox']:checked")
[19:38:54] <sheilablackrose> awesome!!!!
[19:38:56] <sheilablackrose> thank you
[19:39:31] <aqeel> can u test if this works
[19:40:23] <sheilablackrose> tetsing now
[19:40:24] <aqeel> by the way :checkbox is already depricated
[19:40:33] <coldhead> ?fweep
[19:40:34] <sheilablackrose> whats depricated?
[19:40:39] <bot-t> coldhead, SKWAKO
[19:40:48] <coldhead> deprecated*
[19:41:02] <coldhead> it means it still works but they reserve the right to remove it in a future version
[19:41:08] <coldhead> and break compatibility with legacy code
[19:41:23] <aqeel> so better use  input[type='checkbox']
[19:41:39] <aqeel> hi coldhead
[19:42:00] <coldhead> hi aqeel, room
[19:42:14] <sheilablackrose> yup works fine
[19:42:38] <coldhead> great job everyone, let's all take 5
[19:42:52] <aqeel> wow cool, at least i know now how to use the two together
[19:42:56] <sheilablackrose> ic thank you
[19:44:19] <aqeel> well telling you made me learn a new thing today sheilablackrose
[19:53:02] <aqeel> hey coldhead i have already implimented the totop: and tobottom: into the plugin yesterday...now adding few more tweaks..
[19:54:27] <coldhead> oh good work aqeel!
[19:54:56] <aqeel> thanks..
[19:55:58] <aqeel>  credit indeed goes to you, you are the one who gave the direction i should be going....thanks once again
[19:56:49] <sheilablackrose> haha i learnt more :)
[19:57:02] <sheilablackrose> luckily you tol dme bout the checkbox getting obselete
[19:57:35] <sheilablackrose> aqeel is there one direct command to uncheck all checkboxes or do i need to use .each()
[19:58:37] <aqeel> ok 2 cases, some are checked and you want yet to uncheck all, or all are check and you want to uncheck all
[19:59:04] <sheilablackrose> well it kind of doesnt matter cuz i need the whoel document table unchecked
[19:59:25] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/jXsPE/
[19:59:55] <aqeel> then you can use universal line of code that simply unchecks all of them,
[20:00:34] <sheilablackrose> could you give me that line
[20:03:02] <aqeel> $("#documents input[type='checkbox']").removeAttr('checked');
[20:04:13] <sheilablackrose> tq
[20:06:04] <sheilablackrose> i did this var checkedFlags = $(".panelTagCheckbox input[type='checkbox']:checked");  so if i want to know if there is  a box checked i need to do checkedFlags.length != 0  right
[20:06:20] <sheilablackrose> is there  null or empty function in jquery
[20:06:21] <sheilablackrose> ?
[20:06:54] <aqeel> null or empty function, explain ???
[20:07:21] <sheilablackrose> basically i want to know if there is at least 1 box checked
[20:07:34] <sheilablackrose> the code above gives an array of checkboxes that is checked right
[20:07:47] <sheilablackrose> so how do i know if its empty or not? .length != 0?
[20:08:06] <aqeel> you can equate it to null or 0, null means nothing whereas it is not same as 0 or false
[20:08:36] <sheilablackrose> so if(checkedBoxFlag != null || checkedboxflag !=0)
[20:08:38] <sheilablackrose> right
[20:09:16] <aqeel> but why dont you simply follow the flow of your code
[20:09:32] <sheilablackrose> what do you mean?
[20:09:40] <aqeel> checkedFlags = $(".panelTagCheckbox input[type='checkbox']:checked");
[20:09:53] <aqeel> this already checks for the ones that are checked
[20:10:16] <sheilablackrose> yeah so now i want to do if there is at least one box check save to db
[20:10:26] <sheilablackrose> if its null dont save
[20:10:57] <aqeel> then simply ! will be opposite or you can say if true (checked) do this else if false (unchecked) do this
[20:12:01] <sheilablackrose> ic so do that at that point
[20:12:01] <sheilablackrose> got it
[20:12:02] <sheilablackrose> thanks
[20:12:22] <aqeel> you are welcome

[21:13:28] <aqeel> how sweet
[21:23:59] <relipse> can someone beta-test my time-tracker website https://cworklog.com
[21:27:34] <nightfly_> You post about that thing way too frequently...
[21:28:27] <coldhead> yes, it's a terrible distraction from all the... nothing... which was otherwise occurring
[21:28:54] <coldhead> so many concentrations broken forever
[21:29:01] <coldhead> so many breakthroughs never realised
[21:29:04] <coldhead> for shame

[21:47:31] <nattyp> what is the best approach to split html content into fixed height divs?
[21:57:43] <ilian> Hi, I am having autocomplete widget but when I put ul-element in the result it is styled automatically. Is there a way to stop this?
[22:04:09] <R00tk3y> I have a question
[22:04:22] <R00tk3y> Ive seen people define function in what looked to be JSON objects
[22:04:27] <R00tk3y> Is this a common practice?
[22:06:31] <coldhead> it's normal practice in objects, they're methods of that object
[22:06:37] <coldhead> it's not valid JSON
[22:06:46] <coldhead> but it's very valid JS Objects
[22:10:12] <R00tk3y> JS objects
[22:15:18] <R00tk3y> coldhead, like if you had a JSON object
[22:15:34] <dandaman> there a way to disable the ability to select multiple items on a <select multiple> ?
[22:15:43] <R00tk3y> {functionCall: ''}
[22:15:51] <dandaman> ?
[22:15:53] <wookiehangover> dandaman: just use a normal select
[22:15:58] <wookiehangover> without the multiple
[22:16:05] <R00tk3y> And that was defined as var someObject = {functionCall: ''};
[22:16:09] <R00tk3y> Could you do
[22:16:17] <dandaman> wookiehangover: i still want the list to appear though
[22:16:19] <R00tk3y> someObject.functionCall = fucntion()
[22:16:45] <dandaman> oh nvm, i guess if i set the size its fine
[22:24:14] <ilian> how to user autocomplete._renderItem when i have ul in the html?
[22:30:30] <spikku> $(window).resize() is not firing in Chrome or IE ...? Any suggestions?
[22:37:42] <spikku> Firefox allows invalid JS, that's why... :D
[22:51:13] <R00tk3y> Lol
[22:51:17] <R00tk3y> Firefox is THE BEST!
[22:56:13] <spikku> tricks me sometimes
[22:56:27] <spikku> "I'm doing it right! Wait..."
[22:56:52] <dandaman> my data comes back like, [15, "12/17/12"] and $.parseJSON(data) isn't doing anything with it
[22:56:54] <dandaman> am i missing something?
[22:59:53] <spikku> {[...]} ?
[23:01:32] <oojacoboo> why does the context of this change within an event handler method?
[23:01:48] <oojacoboo> or rather, the context is the prototype obj
[23:04:14] <samClemens> How come my jquery mobile multipages arent working under codeigniter?    do I need to change something with the url routing?
[23:05:12] <samClemens> Page:   localhost/monster/482/foo    Link: a href="#page2"
[23:05:28] <samClemens> page2 is present in the DOM, but won't load like normal...
[23:09:15] <samClemens> what?!    as soon as I opened firebug script window, it started working
[23:10:04] <that4chanwolf> Oh wow, Nightly seems to not like jquery recently.
[23:10:31] <that4chanwolf> SyntaxError: test for equality (==) mistyped as assignment (=)?
[23:10:36] <that4chanwolf> 77 times.
[23:11:49] <phiz_> samClemens: probably means they are trying to use console without testing to see if it exists
[23:15:30] <samClemens> hm phiz, thanks but I cant get it to work at all now
[23:16:02] <samClemens> seems intermittent, sometimes the dialog pops, sometimes it doesnt
[23:17:14] <samClemens> I thought it had something to do with using codeigniter framework, but since it started working sometimes, seems its in the js
[23:21:46] <samClemens> hmmm...  arrrgg      well problem for another day   Im going to bed
[23:33:19] <SpacePoet> what would happen if i clone and insert an element with an id?
[23:33:26] <aqeel> spikku: resize() does not fire but it is when you physically resize the window
[23:33:52] <spikku> I know, my problem was much more stupid even than my question
[23:33:54] <spikku> So cheers to me
[23:34:26] <spikku> function wtf(idiot=true) {}
[23:34:38] <spikku> Firefox had no issues with that
[23:35:18] <aqeel> haha
[23:37:09] <spikku> Works now though
[23:41:10] <aqeel> spikku what are you trying to do
[23:43:46] <SpacePoet> $( '#my-unordered-list li' ).click(function() {  alert $( this ).text();}); would this work? don't i need to ( after alert??
[23:45:20] <BinaryKitten> SpacePoet yes you do
[23:45:25] <BinaryKitten> alert(text)
[23:45:34] <SpacePoet> so it wouldnt work
[23:45:51] <BinaryKitten> alert = function not a keyword, so no it wouldn't work without the parenthesis
