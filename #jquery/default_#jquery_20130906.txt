[00:25:37] <PereP> hi all
[00:26:02] <PereP> I have problems assigning new elements to objects; can anyone enlight me? XD
[00:26:25] <PereP> oh sorry, this is more js related
[00:26:30] <PereP> I'm gonna ask it there
[00:28:15] <PhlowHome> Does .html() remove form elements if there's already a form in the dom above it?
[00:42:45] * zhulikas is getting used to jquery
[00:42:56] <zhulikas> it becomes bearable after a while
[00:44:45] <awc737> can I do $.animate().then() ?
[01:06:01] <dangerousdave> can i get a code review please? http://pastie.org/8284282
[01:06:30] <dangerousdave> code works fine, just no idea if it's good code
[01:07:11] <Cork> awc737: $().animate().promise() will give you a promise
[01:22:57] <tobago> i want to select alle inputs inside a form with class task. I tried: $("form.task:input"). taht doesn't work. how to?
[01:23:26] <Cork> tobago: $('form .task:input')
[01:23:45] <Cork> or if you mean the class should be on the form
[01:23:49] <Cork> tobago: $('form.task :input')
[01:24:17] <tobago> Cork, thanks got it.
[01:26:02] <[postman]> Is there a way to include a result from a controller@action into a template?
[01:26:27] <Cork> [postman]: wrong channel?
[01:26:40] <[postman]> For example the last three messages from the guestbook on some of the pages?
[01:26:47] <[postman]> Haha
[01:26:56] <[postman]> Thanks Cork :P
[01:27:10] <[postman]> That never happens :)
[01:27:21] <Cork> ^^'
[01:30:08] <jqueryQuestion> how do i constantly check if a certain div has got a certain class?
[01:31:09] <jqueryQuestion> how do i constantly check if a certain div has got a certain class?
[01:31:59] <jqueryQuestion> $( "div[class='']" ).change(function() { ?
[01:33:29] <jqueryQuestion> how do i constantly check if a certain div has got a certain class?
[01:33:31] <jqueryQuestion> how do i constantly check if a certain div has got a certain class?
[01:33:51] <faraway> jqueryQuestion: with an interval ?
[01:33:51] <jqueryQuestion> else i have to call the same function on 4 buttons
[01:34:10] <jqueryQuestion> nah, i would like some kind of listner
[01:34:28] <Cork> jqueryQuestion: the only thing that exists is mutation observers
[01:34:35] <Cork> but those arn't cross browser yet
[01:34:39] <jqueryQuestion> hmm
[01:34:47] <Cork> ?g mdn mutationobserver
[01:34:48] <b-ot> Cork: MutationObserver - Web API reference Redirect 1 | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[01:35:09] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver#Browser_compatibility
[01:36:17] <faraway> jqueryQuestion: if you only change the class with jQuery you could think over overwriting the functions that change the classes and trigger an event, but the performance could/would be not the best.
[01:36:42] <Cork> jqueryQuestion: so for now, the best solution is to have a function and then have the area that set the class call this function
[01:37:05] <Cork> timeout or interval is a really bad option
[01:37:11] <Nrite> QNS: anyone can suggest a jquery/ajax calendar that is able to perform these functions
[01:37:17] <jqueryQuestion> yes i just call the function that checks the class again
[01:37:23] <jqueryQuestion> so its solved for now
[01:37:29] <jqueryQuestion> ty
[01:38:13] <Nrite> let's say i have a list of events on a list, if I click 1 by 1, it will be added into the calender, according to the time/date pre-determined
[01:39:03] <Cork> Nrite: i doubt you will find a plugin that offer all of these features
[01:39:16] <Cork> Nrite: but you have ex. the calender to jquery ui
[01:39:26] <Cork> and it can be extended quite easily
[01:39:31] <MrS1lentcz> i have this model and form properties: http://pastebin.com/i7bPeH6x but in admin form (edit action) i have created_datetime empty, in database is filled, what am i doing wrongly, please?
[01:40:02] <Cork> some of the features you want might already exist as extending code for it, but you might have to write some of it your self
[01:41:30] <MrS1lentcz> uf, wrong window, sorry :)
[01:43:32] <Nrite> oh, any suggestions for these extensions?
[01:43:45] <Cork> google is your friend
[01:46:23] <tobago> how to select the form element of an already selected input?
[01:46:44] <Cork> tobago: what do you mean?
[01:46:51] <anli> Would it make sense to put a json string as a html attribute?
[01:46:52] <Cork> you want the form parent?
[01:47:00] <Cork> anli: sure
[01:47:08] <anli> Wonder if I need to escape it
[01:47:09] <Cork> as long as it is entity escaped
[01:47:11] <anli> yeah
[01:47:13] <Cork> you do
[01:47:24] <anli> html encoded then, I suppose
[01:47:27] <Cork> yes
[01:47:32] <anli> Well, why not
[01:48:00] <anli> I get the impression that encoding into json is something the browser supports, not jquery
[01:48:07] <anli> If lucky
[01:48:20] <Cork> JSON.stringify if that is what you mean
[01:48:45] <Cork> anli: don't forget to use the data- namespace though
[01:48:51] <anli> yes, but the window.JSON object is IE8+
[01:48:58] <anli> Yeah, I always use that
[01:49:05] <le_gars> Hello. This is probably not the right forum for hey Ill give it a go. I've adde the fb share button to my page. When I click on it in Firefox it opens up the the window but also a new tab. This does not happen in Chrome. Anyone had this experience?
[01:49:17] <anli> Cant jquery give me json encoding with earlier browsers?
[01:49:28] <anli> json is so simple, jquery should include it
[01:49:32] <Cork> anli: no it uses json2
[01:49:36] <Cork> ?g json2.js
[01:49:36] <anli> ah
[01:49:37] <b-ot> Cork: douglascrockford/JSON-js · GitHub → https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
[01:49:50] <anli> But then, json2.js is inluded in jquery?
[01:49:54] <Cork> no
[01:50:06] <anli> how is it included then?
[01:50:14] <Cork> you include the lib
[01:50:27] <Cork> parse exists natively in 1.x though
[01:50:32] <Cork> (in jquery that is)
[01:50:37] <Cork> but not serialzie
[01:50:39] <anli> Thats the other way, right?
[01:50:40] <anli> yeah
[01:51:14] <anli> Hm, thinking about it, all jquery does is parsing, it never serializes
[01:51:41] <anli> Should I use json2.js to be sure I get full browser support?
[01:51:47] <anli> Well, full and full
[01:51:51] <anli> IE8-
[01:52:00] <tobago> Cork, https://gist.github.com/trinibago/6461245 I want to access the form element.
[01:52:11] <tobago> inside the click event
[01:52:31] <Cork> $(this).closest('form')
[01:53:06] <le_gars> I do window.open and this works in Chrome although in FF it also opens a new tab
[01:53:07] <le_gars> ?
[01:54:00] <Cork> le_gars: set the dimentions of the window
[01:54:11] <Cork> i think that is the trigger to open a popup
[01:54:57] <le_gars> I have done that. It works in Chrome and in Safari and Firefox, although in those two it also opens a new tab?
[01:55:02] <tobago> Cork, great!!! I enjoy jQuery...
[01:55:04] <dangerousdave> Can i get a codereview of this function please http://pastie.org/8302573
[01:55:21] <Cork> le_gars: you should never get both a new tab and a new window
[01:55:33] <le_gars> but I do :)
[01:55:44] <Cork> le_gars: if you get both you have a default action you forgot to cancel or something
[01:56:15] <le_gars> so return false somewhere?
[01:56:39] <Cork> event.preventDefault()
[01:58:11] <le_gars> ah
[01:58:19] <le_gars> Ill try
[01:58:23] <le_gars> thanks
[01:58:28] <Cork> np
[02:05:13] <KingAries> Hey everybody. Quick question.
[02:05:46] <KingAries> If I have 3 divs, all called .mountBlock, and I click on one of them, how do I find out if it's the first, second or third div that's been clicked on.
[02:05:53] <KingAries> I guess it'd be something to do with .eq() ?
[02:07:00] <Cork> collection.index(this)
[02:07:25] <KingAries> Thanks :)
[02:13:48] <chocobanana> Hi everyone!!!
[02:13:59] <le_gars> cork: Im just getting e is undefined which is kinda weird
[02:14:30] <chocobanana> can someone tell how to use jQuery to go to an internal anchor link on a given page?
[02:14:44] <Cork> le_gars: event is the first argument to the callback function
[02:15:07] <Cork> ?g jquery.scrollTo
[02:15:08] <b-ot> Cork: Ariel Flesler: jQuery.ScrollTo → http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/10/jqueryscrollto.html
[02:15:32] <Cork> chocobanana: there are a few ways you can do it without needing a plugin
[02:15:41] <Cork> but it has a lot of nice features so i can really recommend it
[02:16:00] <beachandbytes> $(document).scrollTop( $("#anchor").offset().top );
[02:16:01] <le_gars> ok so if I have two other arguments being passed e should come first?
[02:16:05] <KingAries> chocobana: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3163615/how-to-scroll-html-page-to-given-anchor-using-jquery-or-javascript
[02:17:15] <chocobanana> .scrollTop is the only way? isn't there something that simulates the way linking with HTML works (i.e. instant jump regardless of position)?
[02:17:44] <KingAries> Yes, the way I linked does that more or less: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3163615/how-to-scroll-html-page-to-given-anchor-using-jquery-or-javascript
[02:17:53] <anli> Seems like if a table contains no tr, .sortable will not be applied to tr:s after the call to .sortable, but if the table had at least one tr, new trs will become sortable
[02:22:34] <Cork> le_gars: e is the first if you have an event callback yes
[02:24:25] <Reck> I need to get the content of the h3 with jquery from the clicked button. How do I do that? http://pastebin.com/LTYxVS4G
[02:24:56] <Reck> Updated with JS: http://pastebin.com/BqpaXG2L
[02:29:21] <KingAries> Reck: Instead of .siblings, use .parent
[02:29:46] <KingAries> Wait, $(this).parent().siblings('.collection-name')
[02:31:44] <Reck> I ended up with $(this).closest('td').find('.collection-name').html();
[02:32:30] <KingAries> That would work too, instead of find you could use Children, it's a quicker return that way.
[02:33:16] <KingAries> I always thought find() should only be used if you don't know the exact position of the element in the DOM, since we know it's 1 tier inside the <td>, you could use children('.collection-name')
[02:34:28] <Cork> KingAries: find might even be faster then children
[02:34:33] <KingAries> Oh really?
[02:34:36] <Cork> KingAries: as it uses native css search features
[02:34:38] <Cork> yes
[02:34:47] <Cork> parent.querySelectorAll
[02:34:59] <KingAries> Thank's for letting me know :) I don't know why I thought otherwise.
[02:35:03] <Cork> vs parent.childNodes (loop and match selectors)
[02:35:35] <Cork> KingAries: through i haven't actually looked at how they do the selector matching in children()
[02:35:49] <Cork> so they might optimize it through querySelectorAll
[02:35:58] <Cork> and if they do the speed would be equal
[02:36:14] <equinox__> I am having a hard time debugging browser isuess
[02:36:18] <KingAries> Ah right I see
[02:36:22] <equinox__> I have a twitter bootstrap modal that I am trying to present

[02:36:33] <equinox__> but in firefox it doesn't

[03:00:23] <nawi> I'm having trouble with a phonegap app using jquery-mobile 1.2.0. My form has a submit button which is additionally submited using a tap event
[03:00:55] <nawi> the tap event is not triggered the first time the button is tapped or tapholded
[03:01:38] <nawi> I've tried to bind tap, taphold, touchstart but none of them are triggered on the first press
[03:05:59] <bobz_zg> Anyone can help please: http://pastebin.com/0w8ST6yt i want to catch value of first input element bellow link clicked
[03:07:06] <Cork> bobz_zg: $(this).nextAll('input').val()
[03:07:24] <bobz_zg> nextAll ?
[03:07:41] <Cork> next() only looks at the next sibling
[03:07:51] <Cork> you need nextAll to find them if there is something inbetween
[03:08:28] <bobz_zg> works like magic, thanks!
[03:31:13] <ingsoc> (noob alert) does it matter where  startup code for the jquery $ (document ready) goes
[03:31:38] <Cork> ingsoc: generally no
[03:31:41] <ingsoc> i.e. can you have an html file with no JS embedded in it, just all JS in an external script file
[03:31:47] <jQuery> fucking highlight :D
[03:31:48] <Cork> yes you can
[03:32:02] <Cork> jQuery: lol,  bad choice of name :D
[03:32:09] <jQuery> yeah :)
[03:32:10] <jQuery> ahah
[03:32:19] <Cork> $ anyone ? :D
[03:32:31] <ingsoc> Cork: so it is common to have no JS in the HTML file directly ?
[03:32:38] <Cork> ingsoc: yes
[03:32:54] <Cork> ingsoc: that is how you SHOULD write your page
[03:34:05] <ingsoc> Cork: i was intending to do that but wasn;t sure if this would interfere with things and that the actual init code might still be required in the main html page.  I am coming from GWT and so alot of the startup/init was handled for you by the framework
[03:35:32] <Cork> ingsoc: $(function() {}) and $(document).ready(function() {}) is just a helper function for listening for DOMContentLoaded with a load event fallback
[03:35:56] <Cork> ingsoc: only thing that really matters for that to work is that jquery is in the head of the document
[03:37:37] <ingsoc> Cork: i have also been looking at widget libraries (wijmo) they have things like this...
[03:37:37] <ingsoc> $("ul").wijmenu();
[03:37:58] <Cork> ingsoc: ya, you run them in the ready function
[03:38:00] <ingsoc> does this mean that this UI library adds methods on to jquery
[03:38:04] <Cork> yes
[03:38:11] <ingsoc> kk
[03:38:17] <Cork> $.fn to be precise
[03:38:31] <ingsoc> $.fn ?
[03:38:38] <ingsoc> what is that i have seen it referenced before
[03:38:55] <ingsoc> (unfortunately i am learning a lot of things concurrently, converting a GWT over to JS jquery
[03:39:10] <Cork> $.fn is the same as jQuery.fn and that is approximately the same as jQuery.prototype
[03:39:26] <Cork> (if you are familiar with native js)
[03:39:51] <ingsoc> cork,: ah so if wijmenu is not found in the jquery namespace it will lookup in its prototype
[03:39:56] <ingsoc> which is fn
[03:40:02] <Cork> ya
[03:40:20] <Cork> and things on the jquery object is the object you don't use with a selector
[03:40:30] <Cork> like $.ajax $.each $.get and so on
[03:40:38] <Cork> while fn is for $().function-call
[03:40:47] <Cork> $() <-- is a constructor
[03:43:58] <ingsoc> Cork: so $ (jquery) have  functions to do certain things like ajax etc., and $("ul") gets the elements and then constructs and returns a "wrapped" dom element as a jquery objuect
[03:44:26] <Cork> ingsoc: exactly
[03:44:43] <ingsoc> COrk: thankyou
[03:44:52] <Cork> ingsoc: except it returns a wrapped list of dom elements
[03:44:57] <Cork> it doesn't just have to be one
[03:45:00] <ingsoc> well, yes
[03:47:46] <ingsoc> Cork: i am conscious i am taking up alot of your time but, another question is, if i have a list of (li)DOM elements that are built from rows in a DB fetched using xhr, what techniques do you use to identify which one has been clicked, can you put custom attributes on the li ?
[03:48:24] <Cork> ingsoc: i would use delegated event listning
[03:48:33] <Cork> so if you append them to an ul you would do something like
[03:48:39] <ingsoc> using bubble up
[03:48:45] <Cork> $('ul').on('click', 'li', function() {})
[03:49:02] <Cork> in that event "this" would be the clicked li element
[03:49:25] <rix_> Hi, bit of a noob question.  but i have some links, and when they're clicked i want to trigger an event.  I have a fiddle here - http://jsfiddle.net/K6w3b/2/ - could someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong?
[03:49:56] <Cork> ingsoc: or if the ul isn't static either do something like $(parent).on('click', 'ul.class-name li', function() {})
[03:50:08] <ingsoc> Cork: ok cool but how do you match up the li clicked to your data, do you just match the li text ?
[03:50:20] <ingsoc> or do you give each li a custom attribute ?
[03:50:31] <ingsoc> like the DB id for example
[03:50:32] <Cork> ingsoc: you could use the .index() to get the child index
[03:50:42] <Cork> or you could add a data-id to the element
[03:50:44] <ingsoc> ok and index to an array
[03:50:52] <Cork> and access it with $(this).data('id')
[03:50:58] <Cork> depending on what you need
[03:51:04] <ingsoc> ah ok i wondered what data meant
[03:51:04] <Cork> i personally often use the later one
[03:51:20] <Cork> <li data-id="100234"></li>
[03:51:33] <Cork> $(this).data('id') == 100234
[03:51:59] <ingsoc> so "data-" is a notation for jquery that you can access using the .data method
[03:52:05] <ingsoc> and then you append your actual data item
[03:52:26] <Cork> rix_: works just fine here
[03:52:37] <Cork> ingsoc: ehh, kinda
[03:52:54] <Cork> ingsoc: data- is an html reserved namespace for website developer custom data
[03:53:14] <Cork> it is to keep it from conflicting with future standards
[03:53:32] <Cork> .data() is older then the standard, but now days it imports the data from those attributes
[03:53:50] <ingsoc> Cork: are they just strings
[03:53:52] <Cork> (it does NOT export them to the attributes though)
[03:53:52] <ingsoc> or type aware ?
[03:54:05] <Cork> the attributes are only strings
[03:54:09] <Cork> but .data() is type aware
[03:54:21] <Cork> it parses json, can keep dom objects and so on
[03:54:33] <ingsoc> so if data-21 is set, then jquery will try and convert to number
[03:54:45] <Cork> no
[03:54:46] <rix_> Cork: oh actually maybe i wasn't clicking run or something.  i was missing a live though, debugging an ajax error.. thanks for looking
[03:54:50] <Cork> data-21 would be the key name
[03:55:00] <Cork> data-21="something"
[03:55:21] <ingsoc> ah i see
[03:55:26] <Cork> rix_: .live() is depricated and removed, don't use it
[03:55:40] <Cork> rix_: use .delegate or the delegate structure of .on
[03:56:14] <T13|needsCoffee> Cork, how are classes read?  Are they an array, object, or string?  For example- class="foo bar baz"
[03:56:37] <Cork> T13|needsCoffee: className.split(' ') for older browsers
[03:56:42] <Cork> classList for newer ones
[03:57:23] <T13|needsCoffee> I'm asking because I want to write a script that counts how many table rows have .bar
[03:57:44] <Cork> T13|needsCoffee: $('tr.bar').length
[03:57:46] <T13|needsCoffee> I was thinking indexOf()
[03:58:54] <T13|needsCoffee> .length won't work.  It needs to count them and set .css("display", "none") if not the class I check.
[03:59:14] <rix_> Cork: you mean i can't do $('#donation_links a').live('click', function(e){ ?
[03:59:18] <Cork> T13|needsCoffee: $('tr').not('.bar').hide()
[03:59:47] <Cork> rix_: well you can in older versions, but you shouldn't
[03:59:54] <T13|needsCoffee> That might work.. I'll play with it in a fiddle. :)
[04:00:18] <Cork> rix_: use .delegate or .on instead (different syntax from live)
[04:01:05] <Cork> rix_: ex. to make an exact equiv of $('#donation_links a').live('click', function(e){})
[04:01:19] <Cork> $(document).delegate(''#donation_links a', 'click', function(e){})
[04:01:28] <Cork> * $(document).delegate('#donation_links a', 'click', function(e){})
[04:01:39] <Cork> or $(document).on('click', '#donation_links a', function(e){})
[04:02:22] <Cork> rix_: those two will give the exact same effect as live, but in a clean, not buggy and not costly manner
[04:14:57] <rix_> Cork: sweet, thanks.  Didn't know that
[04:20:04] <anli> Whats most common, having - in an id or _? I often use data-foobar_id
[04:20:19] <anli> eh, I meant attribute name
[04:20:38] <anli> Mixing - with _ or not?
[04:20:41] <Cork> - is the dom and css way of separating
[04:20:54] <Cork> but heck it is up to you
[04:20:56] <anli> In class names, I use - all the time
[04:20:59] <anli> sure it is
[04:20:59] <Cork> doesn't really matter
[04:21:11] <anli> I know, but its nice to follow some kind of convention
[04:21:21] <Cork> anli: look at css property
[04:21:36] <anli> Oh, but its normal attributes I refer to now
[04:21:45] <Cork> -moz-background-color => MozBackgroundColor
[04:21:51] <anli> hm, ah
[04:21:56] <Cork> same for webkit and so on
[04:22:12] <Cork> (though background-color haven't ever had a prefix)
[04:26:56] <gregtom6> did somebody use this jquery plugin before? http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[04:28:04] <anli> sliders for time is kinda strange :)
[04:28:19] <gregtom6> anli: I can't find better
[04:28:28] <gregtom6> but I can't use this, because of the documentation
[04:28:36] <anli> I made a timepicker with selectboxes, actually, it was only quarters
[04:28:39] <gregtom6> it doesn't say anything about how should I use that
[04:29:09] <anli> A selectbox with 10:00, 10:15, 10:30 etc is far more better than sliders, I think
[04:29:28] <anli> Its only my opinion of course
[04:29:37] <gregtom6> okay, anli, i'm not a professional, I won't be able to make one on my own
[04:29:50] <anli> You can do it without scripting
[04:30:04] <anli> I could do it, but I am a professional, so I dont have time :)
[04:30:27] <gregtom6> can you show me an example for that?
[04:31:50] <gregtom6> anli
[04:32:10] <anli> selectboxes is something you have to read up on yourself
[04:34:06] <Cork> gregtom6: http://keith-wood.name/timeEntry.html ?
[04:34:49] <Cork> gregtom6: also http://www.jquery4u.com/plugins/10-jquery-time-picker-plugins/
[04:39:01] <OnkelTem> Hi all. I wonder what $(window).bind('scroll.table-header', ...) could mean as event name
[04:39:27] <OnkelTem> I didn't find such using on api.jquery.com
[04:40:03] <OnkelTem> So what is 'scroll.table-header'?
[04:40:19] <OnkelTem> A custom event? But I couldn't find it's declaration
[04:40:42] <Cork> OnkelTem: the .<rest> is a namespace
[04:40:55] <Cork> you can do something like unbind('.table-header')
[04:41:03] <Cork> and it will unbind all events with that namespace
[04:41:33] <OnkelTem> Cork: ah, I see. thanks!
[04:41:50] <Cork> also unbind('scroll.table-header') will unbind bind('scroll.table-header')  but not bind('scroll') or bind('scroll.other')
[04:42:36] <OnkelTem> One more thing... This is part of making a table header sticky. And this doesn't work here after I placed the table in a container which has position: fixed. This is strange
[04:42:59] <relix> is there any way where two successive calls to $.get(….) to the same URL would generate the same deffered?
[04:43:13] <relix> does jquery just link them up, only sending one call if it's not yet completed?
[04:48:14] <relix> or it's probably the browser that does that
[05:08:15] <OnkelTem> I made a container 'fixed' and looks like $(window) doesn't generate scroll event anymore. How to make it react on scroll?
[05:10:26] <OnkelTem> So I think about how can I trigger window scroll again?
[05:11:15] <OnkelTem> I think about trying something like: $('.l-content').bind('scroll', $(window).trigger('scroll')) but not sure is this the correct way...
[05:12:25] <OnkelTem> Yeah, something is wrong. If I do so, I get error message: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'apply'
[05:13:42] <p3lim> I need some help with an issue I have regarding Chrome extensions and CORS, see the comments in this paste: http://paste.p3lim.net/n8hydp/1
[05:14:23] <OnkelTem> $('.l-content').bind('scroll', $(window).scroll()) produces the same error
[05:16:34] <Cork> OnkelTem: if the element is fixed, and what you scroll is in the fixed element
[05:16:37] <Cork> the window doens't scroll
[05:17:02] <Cork> also scroll events doens't bubble
[05:17:44] <Cork> OnkelTem: $(window).trigger('scroll') doesn't return a function, so you can't pass it as a callback pointer
[05:17:56] <Cork> $('.l-content').bind('scroll', function() { $(window).trigger('scroll') })
[05:18:26] <Cork> though you should prob not do that
[05:19:57] <OnkelTem> Cork: ok, I'll try!
[05:21:04] <lzakrzewski> Hi
[05:21:17] <lzakrzewski> i looking for best practice for do ajax request loop
[05:21:24] <senayar> Hi how i can hide my second div id on my page :     $('#jdp-tabs').eq(1).hide(); //hides second div ?
[05:21:34] <lzakrzewski> for example i want to check messages in loop with 10 sec interval
[05:21:48] <Cork> senayar: id's can't ever be more then one element
[05:22:02] <hirsty> hey all how can i make the .show() work in chrome/safari or are there any alternatives?
[05:22:08] <Cork> senayar: if you want to match a group, use classes
[05:22:35] <Cork> lzakrzewski: create a function that starts the connection
[05:22:45] <hirsty> trying to hide part of a pregenerated list based on filter entry
[05:22:55] <lzakrzewski> Cork, could you show mi simple example?
[05:22:56] <senayar> i just want to remove the new div append on the page, because i click on link to do an ajax request who load all the page and i want to remove this part
[05:22:59] <Cork> lzakrzewski: in the always you do a setTimeout(functionName, delay);
[05:23:39] <lzakrzewski> Can I use only setTimeout in this case ?
[05:23:45] <Cork> lzakrzewski: function pull() { $.ajax(...).always(function() { setTimeout(pull, 10000); }); }; pull();
[05:24:16] <lzakrzewski> i was thinking about $.ajax(..).delay(1000).done(function(){pull()})
[05:24:24] <Cork> lzakrzewski: it would be hard to make it infinite if you don't use the function
[05:24:30] <Cork> no delay won't help
[05:24:36] <Cork> ajax isn't an animation
[05:24:54] <lzakrzewski> ok so i will try ! thx
[05:26:33] <Cork> senayar: then you should prob do it before you append it to the page
[05:26:47] <Cork> senayar: use $.get instead of $().load
[05:27:43] <Cork> senayar: $.get(url, function(data) { var fragment = $(data); fragment.find('#jdp-tabs').remove(); $('target').append(fragment); })
[05:39:57] <hirsty> anyone?
[05:40:55] <hirsty> Trying to hide options in a select box based on a filter but it isnt working in chrome/safari due to the .show()/.hide() functions
[05:41:16] <Cork> hirsty: you can't
[05:41:38] <hirsty> works in firefox
[05:41:48] <Cork> best option is to have a list beside the dropdown and what needed to the dropdown when it should be there
[05:41:55] <Cork> hirsty: ya, but they are the only ones
[05:42:36] <hirsty> well i could store the list but some can be very long and would rather not
[05:42:52] <Cork> hirsty: though feel free to file a but towards blink and webkit to add support for display: none on options
[05:42:56] <hirsty> can set visiblity to hidden but would pref not to have the gaps lol
[05:43:06] <Cork> ya, not possible
[05:43:33] <Cork> if the element is in the select element it has to be there, or you will get problem in most browsers
[05:43:55] <hirsty> hence why i am setting styles to it
[05:44:22] <Cork> no, hence you can't
[05:44:24] <Cork> like i said
[05:44:59] <Cork> hirsty: form elements is so called replaced elements
[05:45:08] <Cork> they don't follow the normal css model
[05:45:27] <Cork> and this is especially true for select (and textarea)
[05:53:22] <krawchyk> Anyone know why $(window).on('mouseleave', function() {}); fires twice when you mouseleave to the browser's chrome (aka address bar)?
[05:53:37] <krawchyk> doesnt happen when i leave the window from any other edge of the browser
[05:59:22] <krawchyk> $('html') fixes it i believe
[06:17:13] <rigidbuddy_> Hello ! I'm trying to get the height of a div which contains elements whose height is set by percentages. everytime i disable the css i seem to get good data prompted but when i put my css back i get nonsens. values are way too small
[06:17:42] <alexfu> Is there a way to get a classes dimens (width or height) from jQuery when an element of that class doesn't exist on the page? or is the only way to do this is to add an element to the page, read it's properties, and remove it?
[06:17:45] <xec> ?demo @ rigidbuddy_
[06:17:46] <b-ot> rigidbuddy_: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:18:24] <xec> alexfu: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/324486 might be relevant?
[06:19:02] <Thoams> afternoon all!
[06:19:34] <rigidbuddy_> here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/ShkuY/
[06:19:57] <alexfu> xec, interesting...
[06:20:32] <rigidbuddy_> oops , sorry for the huge amout of comments here is the cleaned version http://jsfiddle.net/ShkuY/1/
[06:20:37] <Thoams> $(element).closest( -= which has my .data('foo') attribute, with any value =- ); ?
[06:21:05] <xec> Thoams .closest("[data-foo]") ?
[06:22:10] <rigidbuddy_> why does the fetched data doesnt seem to fit the real values ?
[06:22:39] <rigidbuddy_> is there a problem with the times the fetch is done ?
[06:22:53] <alexfu> I noticed that CSSStyleSheet object has a title property... is there a way to set that property when using <link> ?
[06:23:15] <Thoams> xec: FANKU!
[06:23:17] <Thoams> :D
[06:23:22] <krawchyk> rigidbuddy_: i think hyou just need to clearfix your wrapper
[06:23:33] <xec> rigidbuddy_: is this what you wanted? http://jsfiddle.net/ShkuY/2/
[06:23:49] <krawchyk> rigidbuddy_: http://jsfiddle.net/ShkuY/3/
[06:23:50] <xec> i think krawchyk is right
[06:24:37] <rigidbuddy_> to xec & krawchyk : Great ! thank you guys i'm going to look at that
[06:24:41] <krawchyk> rigidbuddy_: gotta contain those floats!
[06:25:02] <rigidbuddy_> aren't they contained in the <ul> ?
[06:25:36] <krawchyk> rigidbuddy_: yes, but not in the layout since they are floated
[06:25:50] <krawchyk> rigidbuddy_: floating removes them from the flow of the doc
[06:26:23] <rigidbuddy_> oh yeah i used to read many articles about flows but i forgot everything. thanks for the reminder
[06:26:53] <rigidbuddy_> but why should they be contained ?
[06:27:36] <Thoams> Also, why do I sometimes have to index into a selector call... e.g. .parent()[0], in order to get at the stuff inside
[06:27:56] <krawchyk> rigidbuddy_: that is why you were getting incorrect values. since the ul does not know about the floated li's since they are floated, clearfixing makes the ul recognize it's children
[06:28:44] <rigidbuddy_> i don't know the term clearfixing. it it used for the "overflow:hidden" ?
[06:29:29] <krawchyk> rigidbuddy_: overflow:hidden; is a cheap way to do it, doesnt work in legacy browsers: http://www.sitepoint.com/simple-clearing-of-floats/
[06:29:48] <rigidbuddy_> thanks krawchyk
[06:30:11] <krawchyk> rigidbuddy_: np
[06:31:35] <moijk> I'm looking for the best way to do some "futureproof" validation. Been using the same validation script in my projects since 2002 so with html5 validation and all it's about time to reconsider. Ideas?
[06:31:52] <doug65536> Thoams: define "get at". what are you trying to do to those elements?
[06:32:24] <Thoams> doug: access any variables therein
[06:32:25] <krawchyk> moijk: http://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/
[06:32:31] <Thoams> if I call $(element).parent()
[06:32:43] <Thoams> I don't expect to have to actually do $(element).parent()[0].Something
[06:32:48] <Thoams> and yet
[06:32:51] <Thoams> I do! sometimes.
[06:32:53] <moijk> krawchyk: oh I was thinking form validation. sorry for not beeing clear on that.
[06:32:53] <krawchyk> moijk: http://mir.aculo.us/dom-monster/
[06:32:59] <krawchyk> moijk: haha ok sorry
[06:33:05] <doug65536> Thoams: you haven't answered my question. your answer is "something"
[06:33:13] <krawchyk> moijk: i use http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/
[06:33:15] <Thoams> Access. Utilise.
[06:33:33] <moijk> krawchyk: but the links do look interesting in their own respect. esp the codesniffer.
[06:33:45] <Thoams> Properties on, for example, an object which should be the sole result of a selector such as .parent()
[06:33:53] <Thoams> I still have to index into the result as though it were a list
[06:34:03] <Thoams> in order to access the zeroth element, which... is the only element
[06:34:27] <doug65536> Thoams: what you are doing makes no sense. you are using a library that handles cross browser compatibility for you and tossing it aside and directly accessing the elements
[06:35:06] <doug65536> Thoams: give me an example of something that you want to access directly like that
[06:35:13] <Thoams> Er, no I'm not...
[06:35:57] <Thoams> id?
[06:36:07] <doug65536> Thoams: .attr('id')
[06:36:19] <Thoams> or...
[06:36:22] <Thoams> .id
[06:37:02] <Thoams> anyway, working
[06:41:08] <doug65536> Thoams: if it worked the way you wanted, jquery's usefulness would be destroyed. You can do $(this).parent().find('td'). your way, once you call parent() you are screwed and can't use jquery any further because it returned the raw DOM element
[06:42:13] <OnkelTem> Ot
[06:43:27] <OnkelTem> I see Chrome magic! If I request a TH width using either $(th).width() or $(th).css('width') I get the value of '32' px, but when I inspect this element - it has 33 px widht! How this is possible?
[06:43:53] <Car7i> border
[06:44:25] <Car7i> try border: 0
[06:44:34] <Car7i> then inspect again
[06:53:08] <OnkelTem> Car7i: you mean set this in css? But my THs have borders
[06:53:16] <OnkelTem> ok, anyway, let me try it
[06:53:38] <krawchyk> OnkelTem: http://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/
[06:55:09] <OnkelTem> krawchyk: yeah, i tried both values before, on my THs. There were no difference
[06:55:36] <krawchyk> OnkelTem: try this http://api.jquery.com/innerWidth/
[06:55:47] <OnkelTem> Car7i: you are right, after I disabled border on THs, widths became consitent
[07:03:54] <guest8320> Hello - I've got a really silly question - I have the following object: Object {100: Object} - how would I go and extract the "100" bit from the object? I tried .val() or .text() but they don't work..
[07:03:59] <Thai> Hey, searchin for a diehard coder/programmer (pm me)
[07:05:10] <NoiseEee> guest8320: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys depending on browser
[07:05:10] <NoiseEee> guest8320: or iterate the object and grab the keys
[07:05:10] <grafi> die hard? what am i? bruce willis?
[07:15:22] <burzum> How can I use two each() nested? I have one each() going over some elements that contain a subset of elements i want to go over with another each() - how do I define the selector for the subset?
[07:16:26] <BillCriswell> burzum: You have to assign `this` to something in the first each and then use it in the second each.
[07:18:37] <burzum> BillCriswell im not sure if i understand you right http://pastebin.com/ta1W3sst - the 2nd each here should run over the input radios that are inside the .level.level1
[07:19:07] <burzum> BillCriswell im not sure if i understand you right http://pastebin.com/ta1W3sst - the 2nd each here should run over the input radios that are inside the .level.level1
[07:19:15] <BillCriswell> burzum: Did you say anything? Might have missed it
[07:19:18] <burzum> yep
[07:19:27] <burzum> see above or didnt you get the 2nd line as well?
[07:19:33] <BillCriswell> Didn't see that.
[07:19:35] <burzum> BillCriswell im not sure if i understand you right http://pastebin.com/ta1W3sst - the 2nd each here should run over the input radios that are inside the .level.level1
[07:19:54] <NoiseEee> burzum: if that's all you're interested in, why not make that the initial selector?
[07:19:57] <BillCriswell> barneybook: That's not true.
[07:20:00] <burzum> so how does using the instance of the first run help me in the 2nd to get the subset?
[07:20:04] <NoiseEee> burzum: or are you interested in .level.level1 for some other reason?
[07:20:19] <burzum> NoiseEee yes, the goal is to check if in all levels at least one radio is checked
[07:20:29] <burzum> so show an indicator like "all done"
[07:21:01] <NoiseEee> burzum: so wouldn't $('.level.level1 input[type=radio]') suffice?
[07:21:02] <BillCriswell> burzum: $('.level').has('input[type=radio]:checked') ?
[07:21:24] <NoiseEee> or what BillCriswell suggests, grabbing all the levels and going through the radios
[07:21:37] <BillCriswell> I wasn't sure if he wanted the levels or not haha.
[07:21:42] <burzum> NoiseEee no because i need to know if at least ONE radio per level1 is checked. your check would do a check on all and not per level
[07:21:53] <burzum> I think BillCriswell is right
[07:21:59] <NoiseEee> burzum: you mean other levels have the class .level1  ????
[07:22:07] <doug65536> burzum: you can use the scope parameter in the inner loop
[07:22:21] <BillCriswell> So each level has multiple sets of radio buttons?
[07:22:30] <BillCriswell> or are you using radio buttons like checkmarks.
[07:22:41] <doug65536> burzum:  $('.A').each(function() { $('.B', this).each... })
[07:24:09] <doug65536> burzum: will only look under 'this' for .B's
[07:24:35] <burzum> BillCriswell initially none of the radios is checked, each level has 3 radios. To show "all done" I need to check if each level has at least one of the three radios checked. Initially none of them are checked. There is no default. The user has to do a click first on at least one.
[07:24:53] <burzum> doug65536 this might work as well
[07:27:31] <BillCriswell> I love emmet, though I thinkthe only time I use it is setting up demo code from IRC.
[07:27:36] <BillCriswell> fieldset*3>(legend{Question $})(ul>li*3>(input[type=radio][name=answer][value=$])(label{Answer $})) so fun
[07:27:41] <doug65536> burzum: my answer is a direct answer to your question, not necessarily a better way to solve what you're doing
[07:28:38] <BillCriswell> fieldset*3>(legend{Question $})(ul>li*3>(input[type=radio][name=answer][id=answer-$][value=$])(label[for=answer-$]{Answer $})) now more accessible!
[07:28:43] <BillCriswell> I wish this was my job.
[07:31:02] <doug65536> BillCriswell: is that some kind of twisted combination of regex, css, and perl? :D
[07:31:24] <BillCriswell> doug65536: Haha. I have no idea what it is techincally.
[07:31:36] <BillCriswell> If you put it into jsbin and hit tab after it, it expands into html
[07:32:18] <sarahm> hello, can anybody take a look and try to tell me what's wrong with my code? i have no errors on firebug but i don't get the result i expected http://bpaste.net/show/rt1QP53oSYZBfc3mlqYi/
[07:32:30] <escher> BillCriswell / doug65536:  I believe it's Zen Coding. https://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/
[07:33:02] <BillCriswell> escher: It used to be zen coding. I was looking for updates on zen coding for months before findinig out it was named emmet.
[07:33:08] <BillCriswell> it was renamed emmet*
[07:33:59] <Cork> sarahm: you need to tell what goes wrong
[07:34:03] <burzum> BillCriswell doug65536 NoiseEee thank you all, got it working :)
[07:34:11] <Cork> sarahm: it close to impossible to tell otherwise
[07:34:50] <BillCriswell> burzum: http://jsbin.com/exEFezO/1/edit is what I came up with.
[07:35:04] <sarahm> Cork : sorry, i get no errors on firebug but when i check the html i see that there's <div id="content"> <div class="areas"></div> </div> with nothin in the areas div
[07:36:11] <NoiseEee> sarahm: what's with the <script> tags?
[07:36:22] <NoiseEee> oh nm i get it
[07:36:23] <burzum> BillCriswell that would work for each fieldset but on top of the fieldsets there needs to be the indicator for all of them besides the indicator per fieldset. so you need a returnvalue for each block and check at the end of the each if all are ok or not.
[07:36:30] <Cork> sarahm: createTextArea doens't return anything
[07:36:40] <Cork> sarahm: so areas.append() will append undefined
[07:36:44] <BillCriswell> burzum: Sounds fancy pants.
[07:37:00] <burzum> BillCriswell it is as most client wishes
[07:37:13] <sarahm> Cork : oh yes its because i used to append every area directly
[07:37:16] <burzum> but UX wise it makes sense
[07:37:34] <sarahm> Cork:  when i was testing createTextArea and forgot to add a return then
[07:37:46] <Cork> sarahm: so add an a return area:
[07:37:51] <Cork> that should fix it
[07:38:12] <Cork> (on line 9)
[07:38:24] <sarahm> Cork: yes it does, thank you
[07:39:03] <BillCriswell> Just accidentally hit Command+L in my IRC client and it made a line... I wonder what that's for.
[07:39:18] <BillCriswell> Ahhh, I see.
[07:39:22] <BillCriswell> Scroll back.
[07:39:31] <Cork> BillCriswell: i think you talk about the read line
[07:39:48] <Cork> it marks the last line you saw when the window last lost focus
[07:40:12] <rix_> i have a <select> directly above a <p>, what's the best way to acces it please?  Parent() is for parents, and prev() is for sibling elements, is there a simple 'up one at the same level' I'm missing?
[07:40:29] <BillCriswell> It doesn't happen when I lose focus, only when I press command+l, but that's exactly what it's used for it seems. Never used it befor.
[07:40:49] <Cork> rix_: nope you need to combine parent/closest and prev/prevAll
[07:41:08] <rix_> Cork: why is that?  is it just hard to do?
[07:41:20] <Cork> rix_: it would be too specific
[07:41:37] <Cork> rix_: what if you want to go two lines up should that be a special function too?
[07:41:44] <Cork> or three levels or.,..?
[07:42:11] <Cork> so parent/closest is to find the parent that is the sibling
[07:42:18] <Cork> and prev/prevAll finds the sibling
[07:43:01] <rix_> well there's a prev for siblings
[07:43:11] <Cork> ya?
[07:43:29] <Cork> but it's a tree structure
[07:43:46] <Cork> you don't know how many siblings all the parents can have
[07:43:53] <Cork> it would be an endless list of functions
[07:43:58] <rix_> what about a way to get the nearest select traversing upwards?
[07:44:01] <Cork> if all of them should have there own function name
[07:44:12] <Cork> rix_: that's closest
[07:44:24] <Cork> closest finds the closest parent matching the selector
[07:44:36] <rix_> i have select, p, select, p, select, p - so it's equidistent
[07:44:41] <rix_> equidistant
[07:44:46] <sammych> okay, so I have a big table with a bunch of numerical data in it. If I want to highlight different states for those cells (min/max, above/below avg, banding, etc) for each row, what's the most effective way to do this? Have classes set on each cell that I can select and 'activate' with another class? Or, store a ref to each of the cells that need highlighting and add the appropriate classes?
[07:45:06] <Cork> rix_: uh, that would be sibling, not parent
[07:45:32] <Cork> rix_: what's wrong with $('p').prevAll('select').first() ?
[07:45:51] <Cork> or if it is directly above $('p').prev()
[07:46:59] <Cork> sammych: if you generate the table server side, set the data as you generates the rows
[07:47:03] <Cork> and have css do it for you
[07:47:23] <Cork> and possibly a control class if you want to change what is highlighted
[07:47:30] <Cork> the styling shouldn't be in js
[07:47:35] <Cork> js should only control things
[07:47:58] <sammych> I'm doing the data collation clientside
[07:48:31] <Cork> well then you should store the info on the row as you generate them
[07:49:05] <sammych> wondering, since I'll have heaps of overlapping states, if I add all those classes won't it just bloat the markup?
[07:49:41] <sammych> and if I need to 'activate' them, I'll need to select them out again to apply the control class
[07:49:42] <rix_> Cork: yep, .prev() is fine.
[07:50:48] <rix_> As a web developer it seems so hard to get really good at one language, since im always using lots of different languanges to do stuff.  it feels like being a jack of all trades but master of none.
[07:50:49] <sammych> so I'm thinking it might be more prudent to store a list of TDs that need are 'min' or 'below average', and just loop through them and toggle the classes necessary
[07:51:06] <rix_> do you reckon that typical, or most web developers get to concentrate on a specific set of of skills?
[07:51:21] <Cork> sammych: no the control class should be defined in css
[07:51:32] <Cork> sammych: and then you just set the control class on the table tag
[07:51:49] <sammych> right
[07:51:53] <Cork> that is by far the fastest way to update the state of the table
[07:51:55] <sammych> oops
[07:52:00] <sammych> doh
[07:52:28] <sammych> leave it to me to think of the hard way
[07:53:18] <Cork> rix_: if you get to work at it if you've learned a language you will be able to switch back and forth with around a day of low performance
[07:53:34] <Cork> rix_: but you will only hold the languages you currently use in the fingertips
[07:53:48] <Cork> rix_: but it shouldn't be a problem
[07:57:41] <sammych> thanks again, Cork
[07:59:54] <tpyo> if the first script I reference is jquery-1.9.1.min.js should it be possible to receive the error: Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined NewCare:117
[07:59:55] <tpyo> (anonymous function)?
[08:00:23] <rix_> Cork: i think that's the issue, i don't consistently use any language really.
[08:01:25] <tpyo> sounds to me like its either not being drawn in properly
[08:01:29] <tpyo> or the file is broken
[08:01:33] <tpyo> or something else?
[08:01:56] <tpyo> as i'd figure it I reference jquery as my first js file then $ should be defined, right?
[08:03:01] <tpyo> ah, my bad
[08:03:05] <tpyo> im being a bit of an idiot
[08:06:45] <Guest70361> Hi
[08:06:53] <Guest70361> I need a little help.
[08:07:06] <Guest70361> I might be in the wrong channel
[08:07:27] <Guest70361> http://www.w3.org/TR/page-visibility/#sec-document-interface
[08:08:08] <Guest70361> I need to know even if the page partialloy hidden
[08:08:36] <Car7i> partialloy ??
[08:09:00] <Guest70361> partially
[08:10:11] <Car7i> $('element:hidden')
[08:14:08] <Guest70361> I think I asked the wrong question. This is related to visibility api. Not css:hidden
[08:33:54] <tpyo> is unobtrusive part of jquery?
[08:33:55] <tpyo> or part of asp.net mvc?
[08:34:03] <tpyo> its used by asp.net mvc for client side validation
[08:34:10] <tpyo> and im having difficulty in adding a new rule
[08:34:26] <tpyo> this is the jquery code
[08:34:26] <tpyo> http://pastebin.ca/2444375
[08:34:50] <tpyo> which runs but the function (return value == true;) doesn't get called
[08:34:50] <clarkk> tpyo: unobtrusive is a generic term. It's not "part of" any framework
[08:35:14] <tpyo> jQuery.validator.unobtrusive is what im talking about
[08:35:53] <clarkk> tpyo: it's good that you clarified! ;)
[08:36:14] <tpyo> yeah sorry I don't quite get which tech is which here
[08:36:21] <tpyo> and my javascript is bad, so sorry in advance
[08:36:35] <tpyo> but it feels like i've got most of this right but its still not working :S
[08:38:07] <clarkk> no worries. I'm sorry, but I haven't used that library tpyo
[08:40:14] <tpyo> np
[08:47:17] <xnotte> anyone uses fullcalendar ? i have a doubt http://stackoverflow.com/q/18658049/1611920
[08:53:10] <bongjovi> Am i right in saying I can't use hasClass() to detect if an element has ANY class (i.e. not checking for a specific class) or not?
[08:57:17] <Cork> bongjovi: this.className == ""
[08:57:48] <Cork> or jqobjet.attr('class') == ''
[08:59:07] <bongjovi> thanks Cork
[09:01:05] <Cork> tpy0: it's a asp.net specific thing
[09:01:14] <tpy0> thanks Cork
[09:01:47] <Cork> it's to connect the validator with .nets element structure thingy (forgot the name)
[09:06:14] <doug65536> Ansikt: hi
[09:06:22] <Ansikt> doug65536: hey!
[09:06:28] <doug65536> a global function really ends up in window.functionName
[09:06:42] <doug65536> I'll make a fiddle...
[09:07:23] <Ansikt> doug65536, yes, and var myFunc is defined in the global scope: since they both define global variables, shouldn't the one in the script overwrite the one inline?
[09:07:33] <traets> If interested in this type of effect/animation: https://www.atlassian.com/information-management-infographic where can i go to learn more? whats it called? any pointers welcomed
[09:08:13] <doug65536> Ansikt: no
[09:08:39] <doug65536> Ansikt: I think this will work http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/rM2vJ/
[09:08:54] <Ansikt> doug65536: Let me take a look
[09:09:11] <Ansikt> Ah!
[09:15:57] <Ansikt> doug65536: No, it just recurses forever.  Page never loads.  Also, jQuery.loadScript isn't a function.
[09:16:37] <tomkralidis> Hi, anyone aware of any jquery plugins that do scrolling a list of images? Example at http://www.pocoo.org/#users, but looking for something manageable
[09:16:54] <doug65536> getScript I guess?
[09:17:06] <doug65536> Ansikt: $.getScript
[09:17:20] <doug65536> Ansikt: you already used $.getScript?
[09:18:18] <Ansikt> doug65536:  I found the problem.  I'm an idiot.
[09:19:00] <uwjesq> I just disabled one page and activated another with the same name. However I still get the old page when I click the menu entry. All caches are cleared.
[09:19:02] <Ansikt> My original version worked fine - the issue was that the vendor plugin was (you guessed it!) using document.write.  It wasn't that the scope was being broken or passed incorrectly, it was that the script was crappy.  Shoot me.
[09:19:26] <uwjesq> Any help appreciated.
[09:19:45] <nir0> hi guys, i'm trying to call .fileupload from ajax, and this function appears to be invisible to context
[09:19:56] <doug65536> window.document.write = function() { throw "Retarded code detected, aborting"; }
[09:21:14] <doug65536> :D
[09:21:47] <Ansikt> doug65536: Heh.  And yeah, I could turn off document.write, but then it won't write what it wants to do to the page...let's see what I can do here.  Ugh.
[09:22:25] <doug65536> Ansikt: more seriously though, you could replace document.write with something sane... it wouldn't be pretty but neither is document.write
[09:23:06] <Ansikt> That's true, but I'm always afraid of mutating the browser API
[09:23:35] <Ansikt> doug65536.  Whatever.  I'll just have to let this stupid script add half a second to my page load.  UGH.
[09:24:13] <TeraJL> how can i do something like this:  $('#dialog-window').on('resize','textarea',doStuff); ? i can't get this to work
[09:24:46] <Ansikt> TeraJL: what
[09:24:51] <doug65536> TeraJL: what is #dialog-window
[09:25:17] <Ansikt> is the result of this code: !!jQuery('#dialog-window textarea').length
[09:25:50] <TeraJL> <div id="dialog-window"><textarea style="resize:vertical"></textarea></div> ... the content of #dialog-window is dynamic
[09:28:14] <TeraJL> i need an event for the textarea resize
[09:29:18] <Ansikt> TeraJL: Your .on syntax is correct.  More detail is needed to find your problem.
[09:29:44] <TeraJL> thanks, that was my biggest doubt, becouse i was not even sure it was possible
[09:35:55] <Cork> TeraJL: resize is only triggered on window
[09:36:20] <Cork> TeraJL: so you can't get resize from a textarea
[09:36:21] <TeraJL> Ansikt: http://jsfiddle.net/L7EfW/1/
[09:38:28] <TeraJL> Cork: i can't get the resize from a textarea because it's a textarea or because there is no resize events (only window)?
[09:38:54] <Cork> there are a resize event
[09:39:10] <Tingle> is there a differnce between .ajax() and .get()?
[09:39:12] <Cork> but it is only ever triggered on the window element
[09:39:25] <Cork> and only for when the window changes size
[09:39:33] <Cork> Tingle: not really
[09:39:40] <Cork> get is a shorthand for ajax
[09:39:55] <Tingle> to save me 1 letter when typing
[09:39:59] <Tingle> -_-
[09:40:10] <Cork> $.get == $.ajax(, { type: 'get' })
[09:40:12] <Tingle> ah
[09:40:21] <Cork> but yes get get is the default for ajax
[09:40:29] <Tingle> so there is a equivalnt .post() ?
[09:40:35] <Cork> $.get is more to make it logical as there is $.post
[09:40:41] <Cork> yes
[09:40:45] <Tingle> i see
[09:40:49] <Tingle> thanks for the clarification
[09:41:02] <Cork> np
[09:41:05] <Tingle> I think I like get() and post() more then
[09:41:15] <Tingle> you can see on a instant what typ you are dealing with then
[09:41:26] <Cork> Tingle: in earlier version of jquery $.get and $.post was very limited
[09:41:44] <Cork> but since they introduced deferred in jquery
[09:41:49] <Cork> you can do the same thing with both
[09:42:07] <Cork> though ajax of course has more options
[09:43:48] <Tingle> and the files gotten through these function, are relative to the js file?
[09:44:05] <Cork> resource, you don't have files on the web
[09:44:14] <Cork> and no they are relative to the website
[09:44:17] <Tingle> ok
[09:44:29] <Cork> though you are recommended to use absolute urls
[09:44:47] <Cork> /full/path/to/resource.ext
[09:46:22] <v1king> I'm doing an ajax call w/ a success and error function- is there anyway I can call the error function from the success function (for example, if my output is not what I want it to be) ?
[09:47:01] <Cork> v1king: use a named function and define it before the all
[09:47:18] <v1king> Alright, thanks.
[09:47:32] <Cork> function fail() {}; function success() {}; $.ajax().done(success).fail(fail);
[09:49:56] <uwjesq> I just disabled one page and activated another with the same name. However I still get the old page when I click the menu entry. All caches are cleared.
[09:50:40] <sam-lap> hi guys i've an jquery script that giving me this %u00E1 instead of  á
[09:50:50] <sam-lap> can anyone tell me what kinda charset that is ?
[09:51:59] <nir0> guys help plz
[09:52:07] <Cork> js> print(escape(''))
[09:52:27] <Cork> bah... the bot is dead AGAIN...
[09:52:33] <Cork> sam-lap: you want escape()
[09:53:15] <Cork> it won't give the uxxxx encoding
[09:53:22] <Cork> but it will entity encode it
[09:53:30] <Cork> and that will result in the same character
[09:53:51] <Cork> ex. %E1 == %u00E1
[09:54:26] <Cork> uwjesq: way to little context
[09:54:35] <Cork> uwjesq: "disable one page"?
[09:54:52] <Cork> nir0: just ask the question
[09:55:02] <uwjesq> Cork: Clicked on the page and disabled it.
[09:55:19] <nir0> Cork: i'm trying to call a function from ajax response
[09:55:37] <Cork> uwjesq: the concept makes no sense in relation to jquery
[09:55:37] <nir0> Cork: and this function appears to be invisible for request
[09:55:52] <uwjesq> Cork: I am in the wrong channel.
[09:56:02] <Cork> nir0: make sure they are defined in a scope the callback from the ajax can see
[09:56:10] <nir0> Cork: can i send a message to some page-level script to execute this function?
[09:56:41] <nir0> Cork: this function is a lib
[09:56:42] <Cork> nir0: only if you can get access to the same scope as the script is defined in
[09:57:09] <nir0> Cork: sry, this function is in vendor library
[09:57:09] <Cork> nir0: you prob need to share the code for the question
[09:57:33] <nir0> Cork: ok
[09:58:11] <v1king> Does jquery have any sort of better numeric testing than javascript has natively? I'd like to simply validate a return value as a positive integer.
[09:58:53] <Cork> v1king: typeof(return) == 'number' && return > 0
[09:59:17] <Cork> or possibly even simpler parseInt(return) > 0
[09:59:25] <Cork> opps
[09:59:42] <Cork> forgot the base parseInt(return, 10) > 0
[10:00:58] <nir0> Cork: that's what server returns http://pastie.org/8303673#
[10:01:09] <Cork> v1king: parseInt is a fairly simple way to do it, cause if the return value can't be converted to a number bigger then 0
[10:01:14] <Cork> your safe
[10:01:21] <nir0> Cork: it's being evaluated by rails ujs
[10:01:21] <uwjesq> Cork: Thanks. You realy helped me.
[10:01:23] <Cork> and if parseInt can't parse it it returns NaN
[10:01:50] <Cpudan80> Hello folks
[10:02:02] <nir0> Cork: i can see 'start', but not 'done
[10:02:14] <Cpudan80> Does anyone know what css styling is applied to the "base" of the page when a modal dialog is popped up?
[10:02:23] <Cork> nir0: and you don't see any errors?
[10:02:25] <Cpudan80> I want to change how it looks a little bit..
[10:02:32] <nir0> Cork: yep
[10:02:41] <nir0> Cork: but thats common
[10:02:51] <Cork> Cpudan80: are you talking about jquery ui?
[10:02:51] <nir0> Cork: i hate it though
[10:03:00] <Cpudan80> yeah, is this the wrong channel?
[10:03:03] <Cork> nir0: if you get js errors that is why it fails
[10:03:06] <Cpudan80> there's no #jqueryui
[10:03:12] <Cork> nir0: and no js errors is never "ok"
[10:03:21] <Cpudan80> or well, nobodys in it
[10:03:24] <Cork> Cpudan80: no, but you still have to say what context it is about
[10:03:33] <Cpudan80> oh my bad
[10:03:38] <Cork> Cpudan80: there isn't a css appliced on base
[10:03:40] <nir0> Cork: i debugged, and it sends me to parseerror
[10:03:53] <Cork> it's an overlay put below the dialog
[10:03:54] <Cpudan80> Cork: so how does it make the rest of the page appear "disabled" ?
[10:04:01] <nir0> Cork: so, it doesn't see that function .fileupload
[10:04:06] <Cork> i think it is called something like dialog-overlay or similar
[10:04:29] <Cork> Cpudan80: it grabs keyboard input and mouse actions and cancels them out
[10:04:49] <Cork> Cpudan80: mouse is done by the simple fact that it covers them
[10:04:54] <Cpudan80> Cork: So the issue is that my popup as an asp button on it
[10:05:11] <Cork> and the reset is just a on('keydown', function() { return false; })
[10:05:16] <Cpudan80> and when I do the "standard" method for the popup, the button's click event does not fire
[10:05:36] <Cpudan80> So I fixed that by adding $(this).parent().appendTo($("form:first")); as the open function for the dialog
[10:05:43] <Cork> nir0: you prob don't have the fileupload plugin loaded
[10:05:50] <Cpudan80> That works fine for non modal dialogs, but for modal ones it's all dorked
[10:06:07] <nir0> Cork: same script works on same page
[10:06:09] <Tingle> is there a reason why this doesnt work? http://hastebin.com/bavecewico.xml
[10:06:12] <Tingle> data() returns undefined
[10:06:19] <Cpudan80> in the grand scheme of things it's not a huge deal
[10:06:28] <nir0> Cork: it's loaded, but not for request-level
[10:06:45] <nir0> Cork: i need somehow to send an event or smth
[10:06:49] <Cork> nir0: there is no such thing as for request level
[10:06:56] <Cork> nir0: either it's loaded or it isn't
[10:07:08] <nir0> Cork: how about namespaces?
[10:07:10] <Cork> in your case it sounds like it isn't (yet at least)
[10:07:18] <Cork> nir0: you are accessing it's namespace
[10:07:29] <Cork> $() <-- this will return the namespace
[10:07:42] <nir0> Cork: jquery does work, but plugin doesn't
[10:07:52] <sam-lap> Cork with jquery its possible to convert it to ISO-8859-1?
[10:08:10] <nir0> Cork: i loaded both
[10:08:24] <nir0> Cork: on document
[10:08:27] <Cork> Cpudan80: you could try something like $('.ui-widget-overlay').off('keydown keyup')
[10:08:53] <Cork> nir0: cause 1. the plugin was loaded before jquery, 2. the plugin isn't loaded yet when you run your code
[10:09:11] <Cpudan80> Cork: wouldn't that turn key events off though?
[10:09:23] <Cork> sam-lap: javascript is always unicode
[10:09:30] <d0den> I'm looking for a dead simple text animation for some text which displays "Loading.." while my site is loading. Is there anything I can do in a few lines of jQuery without using a plugin?
[10:09:32] <nir0> script is ran by jquery-ujs, which is loaded after plugin files
[10:09:38] <nir0> Cork: ^
[10:09:41] <Cork> Cpudan80: yes, and that is most likely what kills your events
[10:10:11] <Cork> d0den: what kind of animation are you looking for?
[10:10:25] <Cork> nir0: you will have to look at the loading order of your files
[10:10:33] <d0den> Cork: not sure, just something with a little movement to draw attention to the text while it's displayed
[10:10:44] <Cork> nir0: if the function isn't there it isn't loaded
[10:11:08] <Cork> d0den: too vague
[10:11:29] <Cork> d0den: if you're ok with nothing for older browsers you can solve it with @keyframe
[10:11:35] <nir0> Cork: http://pastie.org/8303691
[10:11:44] <nir0> Cork: its coffee
[10:12:00] <Cork> nir0: don't trust the require calls in rails
[10:12:11] <Cork> check what order they are put in the resulting page
[10:12:16] <nir0> ok
[10:12:27] <d0den> Cork: looks perfect, thanks
[10:12:28] <Tingle> is there a reason why this doesnt work? http://hastebin.com/bavecewico.xml
[10:12:39] <Tingle> data() returns undefined
[10:13:07] <Cork> Tingle: replace eventObject with this
[10:13:18] <Tingle> tried
[10:13:22] <Tingle> same
[10:13:34] <nir0> Cork: http://pastie.org/8303696
[10:13:40] <Cork> Tingle: not possible
[10:13:49] <Cork> Tingle: try reproduce it in jsfiddle.net
[10:14:17] <Cork> nir0: ok, and from where are you doing the fileupload call?
[10:14:19] <Tingle> wierd now it works, i had to remove eventObject from the function parameter o.O
[10:14:39] <Cork> Tingle: event is the event object it holds info about the event
[10:14:43] <Cork> not the target element
[10:14:46] <Tingle> oh
[10:14:48] <Tingle> ok
[10:15:34] <djangonoob> hello, I have a button inside a li and both have a click event, if I click the button both are triggered... how can I prevent this?
[10:16:05] <nir0> Cork: i made a couple of links: 'find image' and 'upload new one', both 'remote: true'. so servers literally http://pastie.org/8303673#
[10:16:08] <v1king> Cork: alright, thanks. I think isNaN() will work for my use case though.
[10:16:12] <Cork> djangonoob: by instade a li do you mean an li or <a><ul><li> ?
[10:16:20] <NoiseEee> stopPropogation on the button handler http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/ @ djangonoob
[10:16:20] <nir0> Cork: server returns*
[10:16:50] <Cork> nir0: ok, you will have to check the network load order in the browser
[10:16:54] <djangonoob> Cork: I have a <ul> with <li>'s
[10:16:56] <nir0> Cork: if i try to call same code from firebug onsole, it works
[10:17:21] <Cork> djangonoob: then check event.target in the event listener
[10:17:48] <Cork> djangonoob: you can use stopPropagation() but my exterience is that it tend to bite you later if you stop event bubbling
[10:18:21] <nir0> Cork: seems ok
[10:18:24] <djangonoob> Cork: ah... right I can check the target, thanks
[10:19:38] <nir0> Cork: i mean, i can call this code from console, it works, afterwards click link, and it stops on fileupload()
[10:19:54] <Cork> nir0: ya, cause then you run it in the console it has loaded
[10:20:17] <Cork> nir0: while when it runs from where it is it runs before the function is loaded
[10:20:40] <nir0> Cork: how do i make it load within ajax call?
[10:20:48] <Cork> nir0: there is one other option, and that is that  $ isn't jquery in there you call it
[10:20:59] <Cork> nir0: there is no such a concept
[10:21:12] <Cork> nir0: either it's loaded or it isn't
[10:21:45] <Cork> nir0: so there are a few additional things you can check
[10:22:00] <Cork> make sure you arn't running a conflicting library like prototype
[10:22:03] <nir0> Cork: another thing, in very bottom of those files i can create a function with simple alert, and it works from request
[10:22:12] <Cork> and make sure you arn't loading multiple copies of jquery
[10:22:55] <nir0> Cork: so particulary this function appears to be invisible
[10:23:05] <Cork> nir0: no
[10:23:22] <Cork> do you have a live link?
[10:23:45] <nir0> Cork: i know this bug with multiple jqueries, appears when u precompile assets on development
[10:23:50] <d0den> Cork, can you show me where I'm going wrong with this? http://jsbin.com/EMeSigU/1/edit
[10:24:09] <nir0> Cork: not yet, but i'll deploy and give u a link in 5 minutes
[10:25:14] <jop008> this class works fine in a div but not okay within a td tag text-align:center;vertical-align: middle';
[10:25:47] <Cork> d0den: http://jsbin.com/EMeSigU/2/edit
[10:26:23] <initself> hey guys, what is val() doing here?
[10:26:24] <initself> $("select[name='premium.0']").val('21');
[10:26:29] <initself> premiums_inventory({ premium_id: $("select[name='premium.0']").val(), index: 0 });
[10:26:32] <d0den> Cork, ty!
[10:26:39] <initself> NEVER MIND
[10:27:13] <Cork> jop008: what class?
[10:27:35] <jop008> in my css it is called tdcenter
[10:28:06] <Cork> well text-align works in both div and td, vertical-align doesn't work on a div
[10:28:18] <jop008> so an own class in html <td + class >
[10:28:25] <Cork> it only works on table cells and inline elements
[10:28:44] <jop008> and class holds the string tdcenter
[10:28:50] <jop008> class=tdcenter
[10:28:54] <Cork> jop008: make a testcase
[10:29:00] <Cork> jsfiddle.net
[10:29:29] <jop008> oke but I have tt solved with help of a div tag
[10:29:37] <Cork> O_o
[10:29:48] <Cork> what ever...
[10:32:44] <nir0> Cork: http://vsluh.ru:3000/ plz press login via facebook, so i can give u admin
[10:32:52] <Cork> ...
[10:32:56] <Cork> no
[10:34:29] <nir0> Cork: ok wait i'll just unlock admin pages
[10:34:41] <talntid> lol...
[10:36:01] <nir0> Cork: http://vsluh.ru:3000/admin/news_posts/new link at the very bottom of page
[10:38:54] <Cork> oh, yay eval
[10:39:07] <Cork> it's so much fun debugging that...
[10:39:50] <nir0> :-(
[10:40:07] <nir0> Cork: that's how rails works
[10:40:28] <Cork> nir0: no that is how you choose to run rails
[10:42:20] <Cork> nir0: can you put a console.log($.fn.jquery) in there?
[10:43:04] <nir0> Cork: done
[10:47:17] <Cork> nir0: well eval makes it really hard to tell why it doesn't work
[10:47:23] <Cork> as the code can't be debugged
[10:47:36] <nir0> it can
[10:48:01] <nir0> i added //@ sourceURL=dynamicScript.js
[10:48:04] <nir0> at very top
[10:48:19] <nir0> so in chrome this request is named dynamicScript.js
[10:49:22] <Cork> yes, but as it is new code everytime you can't breakpoint it
[10:49:37] <nir0> i could breakpoint
[10:49:56] <nir0> didnt gather anything valueable though(
[10:50:25] <nir0> and code's the same each time
[10:50:49] <Cork> nir0: well i suspect that $.fn.fileupload is undefined in there
[10:50:58] <Cork> and most likely cause something else is holding $
[10:51:24] <nir0> Cork: so $ in eval != $ in document?
[10:52:24] <Cork> nir0: no, there is no generic concept like that
[10:53:01] <Cork> nir0: one other thing you can try is remove all the comments in there
[10:53:12] <Cork> as that might mess things up
[10:53:16] <nir0> Cork: maybe i can send a message or event from request to main scripts?
[10:53:22] <nir0> ok
[10:53:32] <Cork> nir0: there is no such concept
[10:53:43] <Cork> sounds like you should learn the basics of javascript
[10:53:43] <nir0> done
[10:53:54] <nir0> oh someday
[10:54:07] <Cork> well i don't think you will be able to fix this before you do
[10:55:53] <Tingle> someone know what this stuff is called at the end of a url: #post635486 I want to have a bookmarkable variable in the address that I can modify without having to reload the page like with GET vars, I have the feeling that hastag thing is what I need?
[10:56:09] <Tingle> hashtag*3
[10:56:41] <Cork> Tingle: hashtags isn't sent to the server
[10:56:48] <Cork> and it isn't preserved over redirects
[10:57:24] <Tingle> im good with that
[10:57:25] <Cork> but ya it can be added from js fairly simple window.locatio.hash = 'post635386';
[10:57:37] <Cork> * window.location.hash = 'post635386';
[10:57:43] <Tingle> ah that easy?
[10:57:47] <Tingle> nice let me try that
[10:58:28] <Tingle> so its limited to 1 hash?
[10:58:34] <Cork> yes
[10:58:53] <Cork> and this hash will match id:s in the page
[10:59:01] <Cork> and scroll them into view
[10:59:20] <Cork> Tingle: if you want to change the url without reloading check pushState
[10:59:26] <Cork> ?g mdn pushstate
[10:59:28] <b-ot> Cork: Manipulating the browser history - Web developer guide | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[11:00:11] <Tingle> Im good with the hash, does exactly what I want
[11:00:37] <d0den> When using the jquery-mobile sliders the default behavior is that clicking on the slider label brings up a text input for the slider. How can you disable this behavior? http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/forms/slider/
[11:00:44] <Tingle> except that you cant load a page with a hashtag, what :O?
[11:00:56] <Tingle> if I press enter on my url with the hashtag at the end, nothing happens
[11:01:30] <Tingle> but is bookmarkable
[11:01:32] <Tingle> guess that will do
[11:01:42] <d0den> tapping on*, not clicking on
[11:02:04] <Cork> Tingle: if the id exist in the page, and is not in view it will do something
[11:02:20] <Cork> anyway i'm off to play with my router
[11:07:04] <sam-lap> anyone know how i can pass in this the encondig type ?
[11:07:06] <sam-lap> YAHOO.util.Connect.asyncRequest
[11:09:05] <tyler11> if using a focusout event, is there a way to exclude certain elements from triggering the focusout event?
[11:10:32] <clarkk> Cork: is that a euphemism? ;p
[11:11:25] <sphinxxx> if using a focusout event, is there a way to exclude certain elements from triggering the focusout event?
[11:12:02] <Cork> clarkk: no just a firmware upgrade
[11:12:03] <Cork> and a reboot
[11:12:07] <Cork> and that will be... interesting
[11:23:44] <tpy0> is this a correct implementation for jquery.validate? : jQuery.validator.addMethod("mustbetrue", function (value, element) {return value != undefined && value;});

[12:07:13] <knuth> Hi guys.
[12:07:42] <knuth> Anyone know if ext JS is based off of jQuery.
[12:07:51] <NoiseEee> knuth: nope its not
[12:08:00] <NoiseEee> nhulea: whats with all the empty else{} ?
[12:08:26] <NoiseEee> nhulea: is 'this' what you think it is?
[12:08:29] <nhulea> NoiseEee: I guess nothing I could take it out
[12:08:55] <nhulea> this is .gp_show
[12:09:00] <knuth> what do you think of it NoiseEee?  It was proposed over using jQuery to me.
[12:09:17] <NoiseEee> knuth: i think if you don't mind paying for something and your site is 'widget' heavy, it can make sense
[12:09:45] <Cork> knuth: extjs is java centrist though
[12:09:49] <NoiseEee> https://www.sencha.com/store/extjs/
[12:10:06] <Cork> its structure is much closer to java then javascript
[12:10:09] <knuth> java not jquery?
[12:10:18] <knuth> java not javascipt i ment.
[12:10:32] <Cork> knuth: it is written in javascript
[12:10:55] <Cork> but it is developed by java foks, and most of the tools they use compile java to extjs
[12:11:37] <knuth> I see
[12:11:38] <Cork> knuth: so how you extend things and similar is constructed in similar fashion to how you would do it in java
[12:12:11] <Cork> meaning you get a lot of goodies when you start, but it is a pain in the... if you want to step out of the frame they build
[12:12:17] <mw44118> Hi -- I am reading the jquery version of todomvc, and it uses some tricks I don't understand.  It starts with jQuery(function ($) {, rather than $(document).ready.  What does jQuery.... do?
[12:12:18] <benlieb> Given the string "5 (apples)", how would I get the string "apples" in a variable via regex?
[12:12:39] <mw44118> benlieb: give me another version of the string
[12:12:54] <Cork> mw44118: $ is a shorthand for jQuery
[12:12:56] <benlieb> mw44118: just need to match anything between parens
[12:13:05] <knuth> Cork this is what I have disliked about packages in the past.  Also I have found they tend to evenully lag behind the open projects.
[12:13:06] <mw44118> benlieb: ok
[12:13:06] <Cork> the fallback from jquery is the jquery object
[12:13:19] <benlieb> "5 (apples)".match(/\(.+?\)/)
[12:13:28] <benlieb> returns the parens: ["(apples)"]
[12:13:41] <Cork> mw44118: so jQuery(function($) {}) is the same as jQuery(document).ready(function($) {}); where $ is jQuery inside the function callback
[12:14:28] <Cork> "5 (apples)".match(/\((.+?)\)/)[1]
[12:14:36] <Cork> js> "5 (apples)".match(/\((.+?)\)/)[1]
[12:14:45] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[12:14:45] <Cork> aaand the bot is still dead...
[12:14:49] <Cork> oh it's not
[12:14:51] <mw44118> Cork: thanks!  What's the point of doing it like jQuery(function ($) {...} ?
[12:14:55] <Cork> js> print("5 (apples)".match(/\((.+?)\)/)[1])
[12:15:02] <b-ot> Cork: apples
[12:15:11] <Cork> mw44118: it makes it safe from other frameworks in the page
[12:15:38] <Cork> cause $ inside the callback will always be jquery, not prototype or something similar if that happens to be on the page
[12:15:47] <benlieb> Cork: that will work, so match returns the match and then the group?
[12:16:10] <Cork> js> print(JSON.stringify("5 (apples)".match(/\((.+?)\)/)))
[12:16:16] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[12:16:19] <Cork> O-o
[12:16:37] <mw44118> Cork: thanks for explaining that.
[12:16:37] <Cork> benlieb: yes
[12:16:42] <benlieb> Cork: how do you account for the fact that there might be no match. In that case [1] fails
[12:17:27] <Cork> js> print(("5 apples".match(/\((.+?)\)/)||[""])[1])
[12:17:34] <b-ot> Cork: undefined
[12:17:40] <Cork> opps
[12:17:45] <Cork> js> print(("5 apples".match(/\((.+?)\)/)||["",""])[1])
[12:17:53] <b-ot> Cork:
[12:18:49] <benlieb> hm interesting.
[12:19:40] <Cork> benlieb: though you cold split it out and check the array separately
[12:19:44] <Cork> also hmm
[12:20:06] <Cork> js> print("5 (apples)".match(/[^()]+?\)/))
[12:20:07] <benlieb> Cork: tnx
[12:20:23] <b-ot> Cork: apples)
[12:20:25] <Cork> opps
[12:20:27] <Cork> js> print("5 (apples)".match(/[^()]+?/))
[12:20:42] <b-ot> Cork: 5
[12:20:49] <Cork> hmm no...
[12:20:53] <Cork> need a look hahead
[12:21:05] <Cork> *ahead
[12:21:18] <LiENUS> bleh if o/topic
[12:21:18] <LiENUS> err
[12:21:48] <LiENUS> is this chan for jquery-ui questions too or is that strictly for #jquery-ui?
[12:21:48] <Cork> js> print("5 (apples)".match(/[^()]+?(?=}))/))
[12:21:59] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[12:22:14] <Cork> js> print("5 (apples)".match(/[^()]+?(?=\))/))
[12:22:19] <b-ot> Cork: apples
[12:22:29] <Cork> benlieb: there's another option
[12:22:37] <NoiseEee> moar apples
[12:22:39] <tpy0> okay jquery validate looks elsewhere for error message when a classname that is the name of the rule is applied to the element
[12:22:50] <tpy0> is it only supposed to look for data-val-rulename or does it also look elsewhere?
[12:23:05] <Cork> LiENUS: this is all things jquery :)
[12:23:26] <LiENUS> is there a datetimepicker to do datetime and datetime-local style fields that im missing or is it unavailable
[12:23:49] <Cork> LiENUS: not built in, but there are plugins that does it
[12:24:29] <LiENUS> Cork, thats what i figured i just wanted to make sure i wasnt missing it, is there a plugin thats reccomended for it?
[12:24:55] <Cork> not really, there are comparison sites for it
[12:25:03] <Cork> it really matters on how you want them to look and work
[12:25:32] <LiENUS> i just want it to be easier to use firefox for them at work
[12:25:56] <Cork> LiENUS: http://www.jquery4u.com/plugins/10-jquery-time-picker-plugins/
[12:26:27] <Cork> so dig in and pick the picker you like :P
[12:26:56] <LiENUS> thank you Cork
[12:27:06] <Cork> np
[12:29:41] <brombomb-w> does $('a').on('click' ... apply to child windows (popups)
[12:31:07] <nfff> brombomb-w, what do you mean? it will bind to any markup at the time the js is ran
[12:31:50] <fuzzyhorns> using datatables, if i want to switch a bunch of tds with integers to percentages, should i redraw the whole table?
[12:31:59] <brombomb-w> I mean if I apply an on click in a parent window, then have a selector that matches in the child window, will the child event bubble up and be caught by the parent's on event
[12:32:00] <fuzzyhorns> or use row callbacks?
[12:32:51] <brombomb-w> I think it would stop at the parent document
[12:33:04] <Cork> brombomb-w: you can't have child windows
[12:33:09] <nfff> brombomb-w, I dont fully understand what you are doing,
[12:33:10] <Cork> you can have related windows
[12:33:26] <Cork> and yes $() is per dom document
[12:33:45] <brombomb-w> window.open creates a child window
[12:35:25] <awc737> I use jquery animate to scroll to pages on my site
[12:35:37] <awc737> i have a css sticky footer, but it hangs, and then snaps down after the scroll
[12:35:40] <awc737> how can I scroll with it
[12:35:41] <nfff> brombomb-w, Im not sure you can access the child dome
[12:35:45] <nfff> ODM*
[12:35:48] <nfff> DOM*
[12:41:28] <quadHelix> Is it possible to insert an <optgroup> into the results returned by Cake to create a select box?
[12:44:47] <quadHelix> I have a field in the results to sort by... should I just write a custom function?
[12:49:00] <ccmonster> hey guys, what form validation plugin should I use?
[12:49:17] <Cork> ccmonster: jquery.validator is the most commonly used
[12:49:21] <ccmonster> ok
[12:49:36] <ccmonster> the one here: http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[12:49:38] <ccmonster>  ?
[12:49:39] <Cork> though "should use" is a bit strong :)
[12:49:40] <Cork> yes
[12:50:05] <ccmonster> hehe
[12:50:41] <ccmonster> with that validator, can I tell where my error messages are to be displayed and all that?
[12:51:04] <Cork> yes
[12:51:24] <Cork> though that said, i haven't used it much my self
[12:51:46] <ccmonster> ok
[12:51:48] <Cork> so you are better of looking through the dock to see if it will suite your needs
[12:51:53] <ccmonster> yup
[12:56:02] <Gate> using .css() I'm getting "cannot call method 'replace' of undefined" has anyone else seen this issue?
[12:57:01] <gvo> I'm doing a $.get("my.xml", ... of an xml file and getting an .ajaxError handler error.  I dumped the thrownError object but don't see anything relating to the cause of the error in it.
[12:58:41] <gvo> Do I have to have a header?
[12:59:38] <duch_kazatel> gvo define "header".
[13:00:34] <NoiseEee> a: jumping off something and landing head first
[13:00:40] <gvo> I know when I get data from a cgi it has to have something like Content-Type "text/xml" at the beginning of the data
[13:01:52] <quadHelix> apologies.... just realized I was in the wrong room.  /me hangs head.
[13:08:49] <Dreamer3> does query have any reordering functions that would take a function to determine what to order by
[13:09:38] <Cork> Dreamer3: sounds like you are looking for sort
[13:09:44] <Cork> ?g mdn array sort
[13:09:44] <b-ot> Cork: Array.prototype.sort - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[13:10:19] <Dreamer3> no i want to sort dom elements
[13:11:03] <Dreamer3> so i could use sort
[13:11:08] <Dreamer3> but how to reorder the dom
[13:11:14] <NoiseEee> what does 'sort dom elements' mean?
[13:11:31] <Dreamer3> reorder them in the dom
[13:11:42] <NoiseEee> Dreamer3: so you'd be looking at using http://api.jquery.com/detach/ undoubtedly at some point
[13:12:06] <Dreamer3> ok so maybe i detach, sort, append?
[13:12:09] <Dreamer3> could it be that simple?
[13:15:01] <Cork> NoiseEee: no that shouldn't be needed
[13:18:21] <Cork> Dreamer3: http://jsfiddle.net/hq37F/
[13:19:28] <Dreamer3> oh
[13:19:31] <Dreamer3> sort takes two args
[13:19:37] <Dreamer3> and does the 0 -1 1 thing probably
[13:19:47] <Dreamer3> duh
[13:19:48] <Cork> yes
[13:20:45] <Cork> so just sort the array jquery creates and append them again in the order you have sorted
[13:20:49] <Cork> that should be all you need
[13:21:47] <Dreamer3> yeah
[13:21:55] <Dreamer3> not working in my code :-/
[13:22:00] <petey> do you help wiht jquery ui too?
[13:22:28] <Cork> petey: yes, just ask
[13:22:39] <Cork> Dreamer3: try to reproduce the situation in jsfiddle
[13:22:50] <petey> So i've got a CSS mega menu, on hover left:0, otherwise -999, the typical stuff
[13:23:00] <petey> I added a datepicker inside the mega menu but of course, when you go to the datepicker, menu dissapears
[13:23:04] <petey> can anyone throw me a bone?
[13:23:17] <Cork> ouch...
[13:23:28] <petey> Especially on a friday cork
[13:23:29] <petey> lol
[13:23:35] <Cork> i think you might be in for some hard work
[13:23:45] <petey> I was looking at something focus/blur but that's only for input boxes
[13:23:47] <Cork> cause the datepicker isn't a child to the menu
[13:24:07] <Dreamer3> Cork: that would do me little good, i believe your example works, and i'm doing pretty much the same thing, gotta be something simple
[13:24:39] <Cork> petey: though you COULD technically embed the picker in the menu, though not sure how that would look
[13:24:56] <Cork> Dreamer3: i'm sorting by parsed numbers
[13:25:04] <Cork> you might have text in there for example
[13:25:11] <Dreamer3> Cork: me too: http://pastie.org/private/xhytvytrkvohggaye4bq
[13:25:12] <Cork> and might just want to sort by strings
[13:25:20] <petey> something like this concept?
[13:25:20] <petey> http://jsfiddle.net/salman/BakWQ/
[13:25:38] <Cork> Dreamer3: never EVER use parseInt without a base
[13:25:59] <Dreamer3> i've done it for years :) does it not default to base 10? :)
[13:26:15] <Cork> no
[13:26:20] <Cork> it defaults to sniffing
[13:26:29] <Cork> so you might get 8 base if your unlucky
[13:26:30] <Dreamer3> ah, so it's subject to bad input
[13:26:34] <Cork> yes
[13:26:38] <Dreamer3> never been unlucky :)
[13:26:47] <Dreamer3> and i've always used it to part known valid base 10 i guess
[13:26:50] <Dreamer3> *parse
[13:26:53] <Dreamer3> but good to know
[13:27:02] <DeltaHeavy> Is 'success: {' deprecated?
[13:27:18] <Cork> Dreamer3: it is fixed in modern browsers, but it is still a bad practise to not set it
[13:27:58] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: no
[13:28:56] <Cork> Dreamer3: i would start with adding console.log($(a).data('due'), $(b).data('due'))
[13:29:08] <Cork> Derimagia: and see that it actually finds the data
[13:29:21] <Cork> and then continue with the parseInt setting
[13:29:22] <RoosterJuice> Would anyone know why when i try to submit a form using .post() the form is not submitting ajax, but rather it's just submitting normally?
[13:29:31] <Derimagia> Cork: wrong name?
[13:29:49] <Cork> ops
[13:29:51] <Cork> yes >_<
[13:29:55] <Derimagia> haha
[13:29:57] <Cork> Dreamer3: ^
[13:30:03] <Dreamer3> i got it :)
[13:30:07] <Dreamer3> need - operation instead of compare
[13:30:09] <petey> cork do you think there's a different way of going about it?
[13:30:12] <petey> not using jquery UI picker?
[13:30:13] <Dreamer3> since it's wanting 0, 1, -1
[13:30:28] * Cork nods
[13:30:41] <Cork> petey: hard to say
[13:30:49] <BillCriswell> Today was brutal.
[13:30:58] <Cork> petey: can't say i've ever had a need to do something like that
[13:31:01] <Dreamer3> now i just need an equivalent of Prototypes gold hilight
[13:32:02] <petey> *sigh*
[13:32:07] <DeltaHeavy> So .success() is defed, but complete: isn't?
[13:32:21] <DeltaHeavy> deprecated*
[13:32:26] <Cork> BillCriswell: well say that to hynix
[13:32:37] <Cork> i thing they didn't like it yesterday :)
[13:32:41] <DeltaHeavy> So there IS more than one "correct" way to do an $.ajax() call?
[13:33:11] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: yes .success was a special case in deffered
[13:33:17] <BillCriswell> Cork: Not sure what hynix is?
[13:33:22] <BillCriswell> Oh... Googled.
[13:33:24] <BillCriswell> No good.
[13:33:32] <Cork> it was the same thing as other parts in defferred, but it was with a different name
[13:33:41] <Cork> BillCriswell: dram producer
[13:33:51] <Cork> the factory went up in flames yesterday
[13:33:59] <Cork> http://images.bit-tech.net/news_images/2013/09/hynix-dram-factory-shut-down-after-fire-pri/article_img.jpg
[13:34:26] <BillCriswell> Fine, my day was a little less brutal than this.
[13:34:35] <BillCriswell> Just kidding. Hope no one died. That sucks.
[13:35:13] <BillCriswell> Oh good, doesn't sound like it.
[13:35:19] <Cork> BillCriswell: no deaths, one minor injury
[13:35:33] <Cork> and with a bit of luck not too bad for the factory either
[13:36:13] <Cork> what burned up was air filters and some new equipment they planed to install to increase capacity
[13:36:29] <Cork> though it didn't do anything good for the ram price >_>
[13:38:42] <Dreamer3> jQuery.fn.highlight = function() { this.show("highlight") }
[13:38:48] <Dreamer3> with jquery UI :)
[13:39:04] <Cork> show("highlight") ?!?
[13:39:21] <Cork> an effect?
[13:40:04] <RoosterJuice> I don't get it.  One submit button activates jquery, the other submit button doesn't
[13:40:34] <Cork> RoosterJuice: are the buttons inside the form tags?
[13:40:51] <RoosterJuice> Cork, yes
[13:41:00] <Cork> and one doesn't cause submit?
[13:41:09] <Cork> is the type correct?
[13:41:12] <RoosterJuice> well it submits regularly
[13:41:23] <RoosterJuice> type="submit"
[13:41:28] <Cork> are you using the submit event or click?
[13:41:29] <NoiseEee> RoosterJuice: submit() will always submit a form in regular fashion
[13:41:45] <RoosterJuice> I'm using click event
[13:41:55] <Cork> you really shouldn't do that
[13:42:15] <Cork> the submit event is important
[13:42:21] <RoosterJuice> button.click(function
[13:42:25] <Cork> and you should always make sure to trigger it
[13:42:37] <Cork> (and handle it)
[13:42:59] <RoosterJuice> what if there's 2 submit buttons?
[13:43:29] <Cork> RoosterJuice: well if they are to do different things
[13:43:36] <Cork> have them set a value on the form
[13:43:41] <Cork> and use it in the submit event
[13:43:55] <Cork> (and yes that would be in a click handler)
[13:44:24] <Cork> sadly most browsers doens't keep track what button was clicked when a form is submitted
[13:44:30] <Cork> so the click event is needed....
[13:44:50] <RoosterJuice> well here's the real problem
[13:44:56] <RoosterJuice> if i rename the button that actually works
[13:45:11] <RoosterJuice> and the onclick event to reflect the new name
[13:45:12] <PhlowHome> Does anyone have experience with jquery File Upload API plugin?
[13:45:15] <Dreamer3> hmmm
[13:45:17] <RoosterJuice> it no longer works
[13:45:22] <Dreamer3> does query ui animation not do transparency
[13:45:44] <Cork> RoosterJuice: bind a click handler on the form with delegation for the submit buttons
[13:46:14] <Dreamer3> seems not to
[13:46:15] <Dreamer3> grrr
[13:46:40] <RoosterJuice> ok thanks
[13:47:08] <Cork> RoosterJuice: something like $(form).on('click', 'input[type="submit"]', function() { $('form').data('trigger', this.name); });
[13:47:16] <Cork> and then $('form
[13:47:18] <Cork> opps
[13:47:45] <Cork> and then $('form').on('submit', function() { $(this).data('trigger') });
[13:48:38] <Dreamer3> transparent: [255,255,255]
[13:48:39] <Dreamer3> ugly hack
[13:48:43] <Dreamer3> transparent is NOT white :)
[13:49:35] <nexxy> everybody knows transparent is bright pink
[13:50:06] <duch_kazatel> obvi.
[13:50:20] <BillCriswell> I always assumed green.
[13:51:44] <Cork> Dreamer3: if you want to animate to transparent you want rgba animation
[13:51:59] <Cork> Dreamer3: transparent === rgba(0,0,0,0)
[13:52:03] <Dreamer3> built in highlight doesn't do that :)
[13:52:07] <Cork> so it is actually black
[13:52:14] <Dreamer3> it aliases rgba(0,0,0,0) to 255,255,255
[13:52:35] <Cork> most likely cause older ie doesn't support rgba
[13:52:55] <Cork> it uses argb in stead >_<
[13:53:06] <Cork> #RRGGBBAA
[13:53:27] <Dreamer3> it's fully transparent black, yes… i guess that wouldn't work on a gradient though :)
[13:54:14] <Cork> Dreamer3: do the animation in css :)
[13:54:29] <Dreamer3> ha
[13:54:33] <Dreamer3> i doubt that works on IE 8
[13:54:37] <Cork> nope
[13:54:43] <Cork> doens't even work in ie9
[13:54:46] <Dreamer3> if i had time i'd rewrite it to climb the DOM to find the first element with a real bg
[13:54:53] <Dreamer3> then use that as the before color
[13:54:59] <Dreamer3> alas, another day
[13:55:13] <Dreamer3> i just wanted to stop using the prototype one for now :)
[13:55:19] <Cork> Dreamer3: though color animation is possible to do
[13:55:28] <Cork> as long as the script takes ie into account
[13:55:42] <Dreamer3> i can use query UI, i just need to find the proper start color
[13:55:52] <Dreamer3> el.css "backgroundColor" returning 0000 is no good :)
[13:56:34] <Cork> Dreamer3: so it is transparent from the start?
[13:56:41] <Dreamer3> yes
[13:56:46] <Cork> ouch
[13:56:49] <Dreamer3> then it goes gold -> white -> transparent
[13:57:03] <Cork> well have the css set the visible color
[13:57:14] <Cork> and then hide it from js i guess
[13:57:29] <Dreamer3> i just need to climb the dom and get the color before animating
[13:57:34] <Cork> Dreamer3: btw you could just animate opacity :)
[13:57:38] <Cork> make life a lot simpler
[13:57:39] <Dreamer3> no
[13:57:42] <Dreamer3> it's the background
[13:57:43] <Dreamer3> not the element
[13:57:46] <Cork> so add a span
[14:04:53] <Dreamer3> oh wow
[14:08:58] <Dreamer3> Cork: http://pastie.org/private/tuojymagsy52freik9g
[14:09:13] <Dreamer3> transparent probably needs changing for other browsers
[14:10:29] <Cork> Dreamer3: btw what happens if you set background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) instead of transparent in the css?
[14:10:53] <Cork> (don't forget the fallback for ie though)
[14:11:23] <Dreamer3> i don't care to try that… that would break the query mapping to fff though, but likely it'd still map to fff
[14:11:28] <Dreamer3> since it's now fff
[14:11:43] <Dreamer3> fallback?
[14:12:51] <Cork> background-color: #00FFFFFF; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);
[14:13:04] <Cork> ie^              all others ^
[14:13:41] <Cork> rgba was implemented in ie9 though
[14:13:51] <Cork> so the first one would be only for ie8 in your case
[14:20:12] <RoosterJuice> Cork: i got it working as is with event.preventDefault
[14:20:20] <RoosterJuice> just incase you were curious
[14:20:35] <Cork> RoosterJuice: well you got part of it working
[14:20:43] <Cork> but you would have a broken submit form
[14:21:10] <Cork> as the submit event is vital to get the browser features to work
[14:22:35] <NoiseEee> RoosterJuice: the essence is capturing a submission on the form
[14:22:40] <NoiseEee> RoosterJuice: not capturing a click on a button
[14:41:06] <sml0820> i have $('.videoCreator').show(), but I want it to be this.$('.videoCreator').show()  - what is the right way of doing that?
[14:42:14] <myosotis> what?
[14:43:00] <sml0820> I want to show a class when a radio button is chosen, but it ends up showing a class on all radio buttons
[14:43:16] <tw2113> $(this).show()
[14:43:48] <tw2113> or better $('.videoCreator').on('click',function(){ $(this).show(); });
[14:44:33] <myosotis> sml0820, I agree with tw2113, but don't you want the addClass function?
[14:45:40] <sml0820> tw2113: there are three different classes it could show, lets say radio1 radio2 radio3.  when the user clicks the first radio button i want it show class radio1
[14:46:26] <sml0820> myosotis: i tried addClass, but since the class I am adding is another layer of forms, i dont think it was working - ill try it again
[14:46:54] <myosotis> sml0820, perhaps you should create a jsfiddle
[14:47:10] <myosotis> some code snippets are worth a thousand answered questions
[14:47:25] <sml0820> myosotis: sure thing, one sec
[14:52:43] <saml> is it possible to do cross domain form submit ajax way?
[14:53:04] <saml> when I submit a form to example.com,  it responds with json. I want to use it while staying on my.com
[14:53:27] <saml> jQuery('#form').submit()   changes addressbar to example.com and displays the json
[14:54:04] <Jamal> Hi, is there any chance to highlight a word in an contenteditable div while typing which starts with a specific character?
[14:54:10] <sam-lap> can anyone tell me why ajax is enconding this char 'ç' into this '%u00E7' ?
[14:58:55] <sml0820> myosotis: http://jsfiddle.net/sml0820/sJbT3/
[15:08:35] <maur_> hi
[15:08:54] <maur_> any idea why line "matches.call( div, "[s!='']:x" );" from jquery file is throwing "SyntaxError: missing ; before statement" in firefox?
[15:15:01] <awc737> how do I get a scrollTop position on a resize
[15:15:05] <awc737> but what it was before the resize?
[15:15:46] <awc737> so if i'm 200px from the top, i want it to be 200px after the resize method
[15:18:49] <talntid> awc737, on page load, store the offset.
[15:19:04] <talntid> then, on page resize, compare it.
[15:19:31] <sam-lap> can anyone tell me why ajax is enconding this char 'ç' into this '%u00E7' ?
[15:19:49] <awc737> talntid, so updated it from page resize?
[15:20:28] <talntid> you are expecting %C3%A7 ?
[15:20:41] <awc737> wat
[15:21:26] <Jamal> Hi, is there any chance to highlight a word in an contenteditable div while typing which starts with a specific character?
[15:21:29] <talntid> sam-lap, do you speak spanish at all?
[15:21:51] <talntid> or, i mean french
[15:22:38] <sam-lap> talntid portuguese
[15:23:02] <talntid> I don't know if this helps you at all. I don't know the answer to your question
[15:23:03] <nhulea> can I set this tom a variable like var state = $("select[name='select_group_type']").val();
[15:23:10] <talntid> but it appears someone else had to deal with it too... https://code.google.com/p/talgen/source/browse/Generators/TalGen-Generator-Web-Jsf/src/main/templates/web/layouts/common/xhtml/layout.jet?r=3031cb2a16c15b2bf0cf26fe99291e11ef1d28da
[15:25:52] <sam-lap> talntid what means the "g" there ?
[15:27:27] <awc737> talntid, it's not working
[15:29:23] <awc737> talntid, http://paste.laravel.com/OIT
[15:29:48] <awc737> or at least, the problem is that when you resize downward, the page scrolls up
[15:29:52] <awc737> i don't want that to happen
[17:38:32] <bttf> hello, i need help with this sliding effect i am trying to use... http://chewbonga.com/testing

[18:00:42] <bttf> well it was helpful, thanks
[19:17:52] <BillCriswell> So, if I do $el.addClass('one'); $el.addClass('two'); it seems to add them at the same exact time. Is that how it should be happening?  I'm trying to add 'one' to position an element before adding 'two' which animates it... I know I can get around this with a setTimeout( addClassTwo, 0 ); but I'd like to understand it more?
[19:19:19] <tw2113> maybe try adding a .delay() in between
[19:21:11] <BillCriswell> That's more for animations, I'm using CSS transitions. I'm just trying to comprehend the whole $el.addClass('one'); $el.addClass('two') adding the classes to the element at the exact same time... If that's what is actually happening.
[19:21:42] <tw2113> it's probably not, it's just happening so fast that it looks like the same
[19:24:08] <BillCriswell> tw2113: Hmmm
[19:25:35] <BillCriswell> I really need it to happen in order, and it seems to me like it should be. I'll show you some code.
[19:25:49] <tw2113> who said it's not
[19:25:56] <tw2113> it's just too fast
[19:26:42] <BillCriswell> tw2113: Is there a delay between the class being set and the element inheriting the properties of the class?
[19:27:12] <tw2113> any that there is, is probably ms in length
[19:31:00] <BillCriswell> tw2113: http://jsbin.com/iqUQOxE/3/edit?css,js,output
[19:33:07] <BillCriswell> tw2113: See what I mean? I find it so weird that it doesn't work without the timeout.
[19:33:10] <tw2113> like i said, i wager without the setTimeout part, it happens too quickly for you to do all the transitions
[19:33:36] <tw2113> it goes from one right into the other
[19:33:54] <tw2113> which is why you need a delay of some sort before proceeding to the next one, so you can visually see it all happening
[19:36:48] <BillCriswell> tw2113: Only one class is causing the element to transition though. It only transitions when the class "is-active" is added.
[19:37:12] <BillCriswell> tw2113: I see what you're saying, but I still think it should work the other way.
[19:37:53] <tw2113> talk to the browser vendors and how they parse js
[19:38:33] <BillCriswell> tw2113: I'll take it to the top!!!
[19:57:40] <p3lim> Anyone here has experience with Github v3 API and Ajax?

[20:36:44] <YammYcoding> goood evening
[20:38:16] <YammYcoding> I have a really old site that I wanted to update the code a little bit. I used to have an iframe, now i want to replace this with jquery and maybe a div for the iframe.
[20:38:51] <RRR2> nice
[20:39:47] <YammYcoding> how could i do it with jq ?
[20:40:02] <YammYcoding> for exemple, for each link i included the iframe as a submenu at the side
[20:40:09] <YammYcoding> and content was at the right.
[20:40:54] <YammYcoding> in order to replace this iframe include, what jq does have?
[20:41:42] <YammYcoding> I'm trying to avoid the page refresh when people navigate on the iframe menu.
[21:19:57] <winny> Hi, is there an event fired when a user selects an item in <input type="text"> box's drop down menu of previously used input?
[21:25:47] <BillCriswell> winny: If anything I'd think onchange?
[21:26:31] <winny> and that's what .change() does right?
[21:38:08] <mr3> i'm playing with deferreds lately, one thing i can't figure out is a good way to add deferreds after a $.when collection starts. for instance, i might call $.when(someAjaxCall) and before it finishes, a user interaction needs to add anotherAjaxCall to the original deferred collection. any ideas on a simple way to do that?
