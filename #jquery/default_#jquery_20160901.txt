[01:34:48] <aFeijo> hi folks... I'm using a selector with context but its not working. Its an event triggered by a select, that element needs to trigger the next select in the same <td>, hence I have others identical TDs in that page. My context is the initial select i.e. $parent = $(this).closest('td'), it doesnt seem to be working.
[01:35:14] <aFeijo> I do $('select.second-select', $parent).change();
[01:36:03] <aFeijo> hmmm, idea, should I do $parent.find('select.second-select').change() ?
[02:21:52] <Cork> aFeijo: closest find the closest parent, so what you need to do is a little hard to tell without the dom structure you're working with
[04:25:01] <anli> Did google chrome got changed timeout settings?
[04:25:04] <anli> get
[04:40:11] <Cork> anli: timeout for what?
[04:40:36] <anli> For a page to load, so if I debug it, I get an error dialog in chrome
[04:40:52] <anli> But I updated now, so maybe the behavior is old
[04:40:57] <anli> I did not get it yet
[04:41:15] <Cork> no, the browser doesn't have a timeout for page load
[04:41:29] <Cork> it waits until the server responds
[04:41:43] <anli> yeah, ‎I know, but this dialog suggested something else
[05:18:47] <daslicht> anyone with OSX yosemite or lower like to have a look at this page please :
[05:18:52] <daslicht> davidpayr.com
[05:19:13] <daslicht> why is the WORK and PERSONAL hover not working ?
[05:19:18] <Deusdeorum> sure
[05:19:21] <daslicht> please

[05:19:57] <daslicht> interesting
[05:20:04] <daslicht> which safari ?
[05:20:07] <Deusdeorum> ops, used chrome, could test safari

[05:21:13] <daslicht> interesting
[05:21:31] <daslicht> me was reported that it is not working 0n 10.10 with safari 8
[05:21:42] <daslicht> and with safari 7 on 10.7
[05:21:48] <daslicht> :/
[05:21:52] <Deusdeorum> however, when clicking on one of the hovered links and then back they wont show again
[05:21:57] <daslicht> any idea waht coudl be wrong ?

[05:33:46] <daslicht> safari supports vw since 9.1
[05:40:17] <iaj_> Hi guys, I hope this is the right place to ask, when I want to "hide" a getParameter with a hash function with jQuery or javascriptish, what are my best bets?  Is there a simple hash encode/decode way to doing so?
[05:43:16] <vmonteco> Hello
[05:44:40] <mogita_> I think base64 will do it
[05:45:43] <daslicht> iaj_: changing teh url ?
[05:46:06] <daslicht> http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_window_location.asp
[05:46:07] <daslicht> ?
[05:46:44] <daslicht> ok is see
[05:47:28] <iaj_> mogita_: can I use javascript to encode with base64 and decode later with php?
[05:50:35] <bango> yeah pretty sure thats doabale
[05:51:44] <mogita_> yes you can, both js and php have base64 enc/dec methods
[06:00:45] <Cork> daslicht: also don't use w3schools, it's a bad source of info
[06:01:00] <daslicht> ok
[06:01:08] <daslicht> whcih is better ?
[06:01:14] <Cork> mdn
[06:01:20] <daslicht> ok
[06:01:24] <daslicht> thanks
[06:01:26] <Cork> np
[06:02:04] <daslicht> where you are here , any idea wht the work and personal hover do not shopw up on some osx versions :
[06:02:05] <daslicht> http://www.davidpayr.com
[06:02:09] <daslicht> idea ?
[06:02:31] <daslicht> in safari
[06:02:38] <daslicht> i cant reproduce it
[06:02:42] <daslicht> :/
[06:02:54] <bango> work and personal work for me in chrome
[06:02:56] <daslicht> and the client is unhappy
[06:03:15] <daslicht> yeah I just got reports of safari failing
[06:04:01] <mogita_> Seems nothing wrong with safari here. OS X 10.11.6
[06:04:23] <bango> sounds like most browsers are auto fixing the issue in the code somewhere, is it all validated code?
[06:04:34] <daslicht> mogita_: aha ! interesting
[06:04:42] <daslicht> do you get any errors in the console please?
[06:05:01] <daslicht> https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.davidpayr.com%2F
[06:05:03] <daslicht> no error
[06:05:34] <mogita_> no errors in console
[06:05:37] <daslicht> mogita_: may I send you a pm ?
[06:05:45] <daslicht> than we domnt need to spam the ch here
[06:05:50] <mogita_> go ahead
[06:12:08] <vmonteco> I'm new with jquery and I have a little question to be sure I understand :) If I use a selector $(foo). Will I get an array of elements if several elements match and if only one element matches, just this element (without array)?
[06:16:25] <decx> it's always gonna be array like
[06:18:55] <xec> vmonteco: some methods only make sense to use on a single element. in those cases it will apply to the first element in the collection - so in practice you can select a single element and not have to worry about the fact that it is a collection (array-like)
[06:39:12] <vmonteco> xec: Thanks, that's clearer for me. :)
[06:43:13] <codecutter> i have a html string that is wrapped by 'li' how do i remove the 'li'?
[06:44:58] <xec> as a string? tricky. better to turn it into DOM (with someDummyElement.html(myString) for instance) and then use .unwrap()
[06:45:22] <xec> actually
[06:45:30] <xec> that probably won't work either
[06:46:06] <xec> codecutter: can you make a jsfiddle with the actual strings you're working with, and what you like the end result to be
[06:47:14] <codecutter> its simple: given '<li><div>foo</div></li> output should be '<div>foo</div>'
[06:50:31] <xec> codecutter: https://jsfiddle.net/5zndpb5q/
[06:51:28] <xec> it can be made even simpler if the <li> is always the root element
[06:51:43] <codecutter> xec: what if there were multiple li's and i want to remove the outter most?
[06:51:53] <codecutter> yes,
[06:52:05] <codecutter> what if  wanted to remove the root element?
[06:52:24] <xec> https://jsfiddle.net/5zndpb5q/1/
[06:53:00] <xec> .html() uses innerHTML, so it won't return the root element by default
[06:53:11] <Cork> codecutter: would like to comment, that you should often avoid working with html, convert it into a dom structure and manipulate that instead
[06:53:22] <Cork> it is often faster and simpler (and lets you keep state)
[06:53:33] <codecutter> Cork: i'm doing multiple appends
[06:53:34] <codecutter> :)
[06:53:40] <Cork> and?
[06:53:43] <xec> you can append nodes
[06:54:08] <codecutter> Cork: we already discussed this, awhile back....
[06:54:27] <Cork> codecutter: that would have had to be a long time ago then
[06:54:33] <Cork> cause i have no recolection what so ever of it
[06:55:02] <Cork> the only reason to keep things as html is if it is actually a template
[06:55:16] <Cork> else it is better to keep it as dom
[06:56:25] <codecutter> let me try .html()
[06:56:38] <xec> codecutter: for what it's worth i agree 100% with cork here, you're only creating extra work for yourself by working with html strings in the browser
[06:56:57] <Cork> you also make the browser slower
[06:57:16] <Cork> cause parsing back and forth from html and dom is expensive
[06:57:16] <codecutter> i agree with Cork too
[06:57:55] <codecutter> there is a reason for this... take my word for it
[06:58:15] <xec> but is the reason sound? :)
[07:01:04] <codecutter> maybe not but it seems to work
[07:01:17] <codecutter> when it break i can fix it then
[07:01:24] <codecutter> working against the clock, here :)
[07:08:04] <Cork> ugg that has to be one of the most frustrating responses there is "i ya, it is broken and slow, but it works; so i don't care"...
[07:09:50] <Uhkis> Cork: it's not like you're gonna get fired for it :)
[07:10:30] <bomb> he'd make it to management staff at major software companies
[07:10:31] <Cork> Uhkis: same goes from spaghetti code...
[07:10:42] <Cork> bomb: lol
[07:30:44] <decx> aah.. enterprise code
[07:30:48] <decx> hnnng
[08:12:16] <decx>    mm,..-
[08:13:03] <decx> oops, never vacuum your desk when you still have the irc input in focus
[08:13:11] <Cork> lol
[08:13:34] <Cork> so not "my cat walked over the keyboard"
[08:13:35] <Cork> :D
[08:14:06] <decx> i got my cat a decoy keyboard for that
[08:14:22] <sonotos> great idea
[08:34:32] <burzum2> what is the best way to make sure these two iCheck()s http://pastebin.com/aw78UUn9 are bound to any new HTML  that is appeded to the DOM? I'm not sure how to use on() in this case because there is no event involved.
[08:34:53] <burzum2> i dont want to repeat the code whenever i add markup in a callback
[08:35:19] <Cork> whats iCheck?
[08:35:37] <burzum2> doesn't matter, could be anything else.
[08:35:40] <burzum2> https://github.com/fronteed/icheck
[08:35:46] <Cork> it matters quite a bit actually
[08:36:02] <Cork> ok, so it is js replacement for a checkbox
[08:36:09] <burzum2> yes
[08:36:14] <Cork> then you have to run it on each element you want it to work on
[08:36:19] <Cork> as it has to modify the dom
[08:36:37] <burzum2> well, im aware of that
[08:36:58] <burzum2> but i dont want to call it over and over after i did an .append() for example
[08:37:12] <Cork> you have to one way or another
[08:37:12] <burzum2> so there is no way to have a watcher doing that for me to keep my code DRY?
[08:37:16] <Cork> no
[08:37:24] <burzum2> arrr... i really hate js :(
[08:37:25] <Cork> only event handlers can be delegated
[08:37:29] <burzum2> thank you
[08:37:45] <Cork> burzum2: you could just use css for the styling instead and it would solve this
[08:38:21] <Xatenev> Heya
[08:38:25] <burzum2> ive tried that before but any solution i found was not compatible with the markup structure bootstrap3 uses
[08:38:28] <Cork> the problem comes from that you're using js for styling
[08:38:30] <Xatenev> is there any solution to make html return xhtml instead of html?
[08:38:43] <Xatenev> something like myElement.html(function() { return properXHTML; });
[08:38:59] <Cork> Xatenev: xhtml is a dead language
[08:39:03] <Cork> why bother?
[08:39:05] <Xatenev> Yea that doesnt help with my problem
[08:39:07] <Xatenev> TinyMCE
[08:39:07] <Xatenev> ^^
[08:39:25] <Cork> Xatenev: and it requires xhtml?
[08:39:27] <Xatenev> yes
[08:39:31] <Cork> ...
[08:39:36] <burzum2> Cork the problem is all the solutions i found work on the label but the label is wrapped around the input and you can't select the parent element in css
[08:39:50] <Xatenev> Cork: "Note however that there is no need to change the doctype to XHTML because TinyMCE will produce XHTML in any case."
[08:39:58] <Cork> Xatenev: you would have to take the dom element and convert it to an xml document i think
[08:40:20] <Cork> Xatenev: ok, you want xhtml, but does it actually break from html?
[08:40:33] <Xatenev> yes it does
[08:40:34] <Cork> Xatenev: cause it shouldn't unless it requires xhtml 1.0 strict
[08:40:37] <Cork> ugg
[08:40:42] <Xatenev> because we save the data in db and then output it again
[08:40:45] <Xatenev> and then have wrong data in output
[08:40:48] * Cork takes a note to not touch tinymce
[08:40:55] <Xatenev> tinymce is really really bad
[08:40:56] <Xatenev> in every case.
[08:40:59] <Cork> ya
[08:41:03] <Cork> obviously
[08:41:06] <Xatenev> I just read: there is a jQuery plugin providing a innerXHTML() function
[08:41:17] <Xatenev> MAybe I hsould try that out
[08:41:17] <Cork> <_<'
[08:41:26] <Cork> go ahead
[08:41:32] <Xatenev> The problem is, it have to be IE8 compatible
[08:41:32] <Xatenev> LOL
[08:41:38] <Cork> it isn't
[08:41:44] <Cork> ie < 10 isn't xhtml compatible
[08:41:57] <Xatenev> let me check what ie version i have to be compatible too
[08:41:59] <Xatenev> I guess im wrong with ie8 then
[08:42:19] <Cork> Xatenev: its not that important there are barly any xhtml document out there
[08:42:25] <Xatenev> its 11
[08:43:05] <Cork> 99.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999% of all the so called xhtml sites are just html with extra error parsing
[08:43:24] <Cork> cause basically no site uses xhtml content-type so it is just html
[08:44:00] <Cork> and that is what made xhtml so silly
[08:45:09] <Cork> (by error parsing btw i mean the parser parses the xhtml syntax as html and corrected the syntax difference with the error parser)
[08:52:35] <codecutter> I need to find the first parent with class .foo
[08:52:50] <Cork> first or closest?
[08:53:02] <codecutter> closest seems to fail
[08:53:15] <Cork> uh
[08:53:16] <codecutter> cloests gets me the parent of the parent
[08:53:29] <codecutter> i just need the first parent
[08:53:42] <Cork> so the element the furtherst away?
[08:53:48] <Cork> or what do you mean by first
[08:54:08] <decx> doesnt matter to closest it'll return the... closest fitting element
[08:54:20] <Cork> no
[08:54:28] <Cork> it returns the closest parent matching the selector
[08:54:28] <decx> starting at itself
[08:54:37] <codecutter> hmm
[08:54:38] <Cork> it won't return siblings
[08:54:55] <decx> of course, i mean cloest as in up the tree not sideways ^^
[08:55:06] <codecutter> you're right
[08:55:07] <codecutter> nvm
[08:55:13] <Cork> decx: it is a common way of ppl looking at it though :)
[08:55:22] <Cork> and ppl get very confused ^^
[08:55:46] <decx> well closestParent() is a bit verbose
[08:55:48] <decx> ;)
[08:55:53] <Cork> ya
[08:56:04] <Cork> when you know what it does the name makes perfect sense
[08:56:43] <Cork> i'm a bit surprised how many developers actually think you can query the dom for the element graphically closest to the current element
[09:32:28] <Xatenev> Cork: I could solve this using some of tinymce methods
[09:32:30] <Xatenev> to retrieve the content
[09:41:55] <z1haze_work> hey, can someone look at the console on http://www.marcjacobsbeauty.com/lip/lip-gloss/enamored-lip/MJ40003.html - I have a function that runs on dom ready that takes and <img> tag with a class of svg and converts it to an actual svg, but it isnt running, and im assuming this cors error is related
[09:52:38] <jquery454> Hello everyone
[09:54:05] <taplar> bonjour
[09:54:29] <jquery454> I have an issue, while using wenzhixin's bootstrap Table. I am using two tables on the same page, with checkboxes. Both load the same data. When I check a specific row using the checkbox, the row becomes selected in the second table as well (without its checkbox being checked). Can I completely separate the tables somehow?
[09:55:41] <Cork> jquery454: make sure the checkboxes use separate ids
[09:56:09] <Cork> if that doesn't happen it sounds like the plugin doesn't isolate correctly between instances
[09:56:29] <Cork> (there might be a solution, but i would need a jsfiddle with the problem to be able to tell)
[09:59:23] <jquery454> The ids for the checkboxes are indeed different (the checkboxes are not linked), however I get the same row as selected from both tables. If for example I select the first row from the first table, the data from the first row of the second table will return as well.
[09:59:44] <z1haze_work> I have an svg that im including on my page as an <img> but on dom ready i fun a function to convert it to an actual svg, but for some reason its not working in production and im getting cors errors
[09:59:47] <Cork> how are you selecting?
[09:59:48] <z1haze_work> any ideas?
[10:00:02] <jquery454> Radio buttons. The data is preloaded via ajax
[10:00:29] <Cork> z1haze_work: provide a pastbin or similar with the error
[10:00:54] <z1haze_work> sure
[10:01:00] <Cork> jquery454: uh, what?
[10:01:08] <z1haze_work> http://dpaste.com/1YQ5DCX
[10:01:09] <Cork> jquery454: are you working with checkboxes or radiobuttons?
[10:01:44] <jquery454> Sorry, my bad...radio buttons
[10:01:54] <Cork> z1haze_work: you're loading the svg content through ajax
[10:02:06] <Cork> z1haze_work: that means the origin server has to allow ajax to fetch content from it
[10:02:11] * Cork afk
[10:02:38] <z1haze_work> its on the same server though
[10:02:47] <z1haze_work> it works in development, sandbox, and staging servers
[10:03:02] <z1haze_work> maybe production environments move assets to another server?
[10:03:30] <z1haze_work> im not really fetching it with ajax either
[10:05:55] <z1haze_work> my mistake Cork, it seems i am using $.get to fetch it again
[10:13:12] <Yepp> I expect the .then() will happen after this http://kopy.io/h7gQF#o9WCGBnWoxiq7Q but it's not.
[10:13:54] <Yepp> what's wrong there?
[10:13:58] <shoky> Yepp: you should only expect that if you pass a promise to $.when
[10:14:48] <shoky> well actually if you don't pass a promise it'll just resolve with whatever you pass
[10:15:02] <shoky> anyways not clear what you're passing
[10:15:17] <Yepp> hmm, if i'll be doing a promise... shouldn't that make $.when not usable? I mean why not just make a promise then
[10:15:32] <shoky> $.when is really only useful if you have multiple promises
[10:15:36] <Yepp> shoky: just wanted the fetching to be done
[10:15:43] <shoky> if you just have one promise there's no use to $.when
[10:15:48] <Yepp> oh
[10:15:51] <Yepp> hmm
[10:16:16] <Yepp> does putting the function inside Promise puts it in a different scope?
[10:16:40] <Yepp> cause some part of my code does not work when it's inside a promise
[10:17:10] <shoky> scope doesn't really have anything to do with promises, so donno what you mean
[10:17:21] <Yepp> Semantic UI's api() does not read $.fn.api.settings.api.foo
[10:17:37] <Yepp> I am using SUI's api()
[10:17:45] <shoky> no idea what that is
[10:18:51] <Yepp> similar thing to an Ajax call, action property on line 3 uses that api. Hmm, i'll make a paste
[10:19:33] <Yepp> shoky: http://kopy.io/FsRcc#duBcf0gnU55Z4u
[10:19:39] <Yepp> get what I mean now?
[10:19:55] <Yepp> shoky: http://semantic-ui.com/behaviors/api.html#/usage
[10:20:21] <Yepp> when it's inside a Promise it doesn't read the action from the settings.api
[10:20:26] <Yepp> i dunno why
[10:21:13] <Deusdeorum> So, i'm trying to use a redirect to $(location).attr('href',"http://www.myflaskpythonapp.com"); which should fire a python script powered by Flask, this work when I enter just http://www.myflaskpythonapp.com/ but redirecting doesn't work
[10:21:23] <zumba_addict> hi folks, i have this html - http://pastebin.com/niNNTcxt and I'm using `$(e.target).parent('.question').addClass('active');` but it's not finding it
[10:21:26] <Deusdeorum> "Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'querySelector' on 'Document':"
[10:21:29] <Deusdeorum> any ides?
[10:21:52] <Yepp> err nvm
[10:22:12] <zumba_addict> so I'm clicking on the <dt class="question">
[10:22:30] <shoky> Deusdeorum: don't use jquery on the location object, jquery is for DOM stuff
[10:22:43] <shoky> Deusdeorum:  location.href = ...;   or  location.replace(...)
[10:22:49] <Deusdeorum> ah..
[10:23:02] <zumba_addict> Error is Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'querySelector' on 'Document': '[object HTMLElement]' is not a valid selector
[10:23:58] <shoky> zumba_addict: more info/code needed
[10:24:29] <shoky> cause it looks like the string '[object HTMLElement]' is being passed to $()
[10:24:55] <shoky> so you're taking an element object and turning into a string somehow, e.g. by concatenating something to it
[10:25:01] <zumba_addict> sorry, there is only error when i do it in console
[10:25:04] <Deusdeorum> shoky can I fire " window.location.href " within jquery then? or shouldn't use jquery at all?
[10:25:04] <zumba_addict> http://pastebin.com/Xpw63CWW
[10:25:18] <zumba_addict> but active class is not getting added instead
[10:25:22] <zumba_addict> so no js issues
[10:25:32] <shoky> Deusdeorum: there is no "within jquery".. jquery is a library with tools to do stuff.  you can use them or not, has nothing to do with what you do with location object :)
[10:25:41] <shoky> Deusdeorum: so to answer your question, yes, you can
[10:26:33] <Deusdeorum> oh lol, window.location.href is pure js?
[10:26:35] <shoky> zumba_addict: when you do what in console?
[10:26:52] <shoky> Deusdeorum: it's a native browser object/property
[10:26:56] <Deusdeorum> thank you shoky
[10:28:23] <zumba_addict> manually executing this $(e.target).parent('.question').addClass('active');
[10:28:35] <zumba_addict> while I was inside the function
[10:28:47] <zumba_addict> since i put a breakpoint
[10:30:48] <shoky> donno.. check the stack trace of that error
[10:31:06] <zumba_addict> ok
[10:31:19] <zumba_addict> but during runtime when i press step over in Chrome there is no error
[10:31:24] <zumba_addict> it's just that it's not getting added
[10:31:28] <zumba_addict> is my code correct though?
[10:31:36] <shoky> is e.target the right element?
[10:32:52] <shoky> donno if your code is correct, only seen a small bit
[10:33:32] <zumba_addict> yes
[10:34:15] <zumba_addict> when i type e.target in console, i see the whole line i clicked
[10:34:40] <shoky> and when you run just  $(e.target)   you get that error?
[10:36:16] <zumba_addict> check this out - http://imgur.com/a/ZtVbo
[10:36:22] <zumba_addict> yes, i get that error
[10:37:01] <shoky> oh.
[10:37:04] <shoky> mm
[10:37:08] <zumba_addict> http://imgur.com/a/caUsJ
[10:37:08] <shoky> is jquery included? :)
[10:37:18] <shoky> console.log($)
[10:37:19] <zumba_addict> yes
[10:37:22] <zumba_addict> ok
[10:37:24] <zumba_addict> one sec
[10:37:24] <shoky> i bet that gives you not jquery
[10:37:44] <shoky> in the console, by default $ is  document.querySelector
[10:38:00] <zumba_addict> http://imgur.com/a/adqAs
[10:38:09] <zumba_addict> does it look right?
[10:38:18] <shoky> no, that's not jquery
[10:38:26] <shoky> that's document.querySelector, the default value of $ in the console
[10:38:26] <zumba_addict> oh my
[10:38:35] <shoky> meaning jquery is not included or is in noConflict
[10:38:39] <zumba_addict> not sure why it's doing that but I'm importing it on top
[10:38:53] <zumba_addict> i have this  - import $ from 'jquery';
[10:39:06] <zumba_addict> awesome troubleshooting tip :) learned something new
[10:39:13] <zumba_addict> k
[10:39:23] <shoky> uhm are you compiling that with something..?
[10:39:58] <shoky> babel?
[10:40:02] <zumba_addict> yes
[10:40:06] <zumba_addict> i changed it to $_
[10:40:13] <zumba_addict> let's see what's going to happen
[10:40:22] <shoky> ok... so you should learn how use modules..
[10:40:30] <shoky> and that in modules you have your own scope
[10:40:36] <shoky> which doesnt affect global
[10:40:50] <zumba_addict> gotcha
[10:41:00] <zumba_addict> why is it defaulting to querySelector?
[10:41:09] <shoky> because that's the default... why not?
[10:41:12] <zumba_addict> or is it just by default
[10:41:16] <zumba_addict> got it
[10:41:29] <zumba_addict> so it's really not a a good idea to override $
[10:41:35] <shoky> it is
[10:41:36] <shoky> it's fine
[10:41:51] <shoky> it's only querySelector by defualt _in the console_
[10:41:58] <shoky> usually your code doesnt run in the console
[10:42:46] <zumba_addict> btw, changing it to $_ didn't help
[10:42:55] <shoky> it's not overwriting
[10:43:03] <shoky> it's not touching the global scope at all
[10:43:10] <shoky> you won't have access to jquery in the console
[10:43:27] <shoky> (unless you force it somehow like setting $ to the local jquery while in a breakpoint)
[10:43:51] <shoky> you're using browserify/webpack also?
[10:44:32] <zumba_addict> webpack
[10:44:35] <shoky> modules have their own scope. so if you have $ in a module (or $_ or anything else)  it won't overwrite anything in the global scope. (as it should be)
[10:45:21] <shoky> (because technically modules are just functions. and in js functions have their own scope as you should know ;p)
[10:47:06] <zumba_addict> got it
[10:47:24] <zumba_addict> i added console.log in code and we'll see the value of $
[10:47:47] <shoky> just to be clear - this is a good thing.. we didn't have to mess up the global window object with a $ property,  globals are bad
[10:48:29] <shoky> ya the issue is only when actually entering code in the console
[10:48:43] <shoky> because then you're in the global scope
[10:50:02] <zumba_addict> this is what I see now, - http://imgur.com/a/3mhfz
[10:50:17] <zumba_addict> is it still wrong
[10:50:39] <shoky> that's jquery
[10:50:54] <zumba_addict> oh cool
[10:51:02] <zumba_addict> let me look at the dom and see if it added active
[10:51:28] <shoky> .parent(selector)  looks smelly
[10:51:37] <shoky> usually you want  .closest(selector)
[10:51:45] <zumba_addict> ok
[10:51:54] <shoky> and if using parent then doesnt make much sense to use it with a selector usually
[10:51:57] <zumba_addict> old code didn't add the active
[10:52:19] <shoky> log the element you're adding it to, see if you selected it properly
[10:52:34] <zumba_addict> so code is <dl> <dt> <dd> and I click on <dt> but i want to add active in <dd>
[10:52:54] <shoky> then that's not parent, is it?
[10:53:04] <zumba_addict> parent is dl
[10:53:18] <zumba_addict> and dt and dd are under dl
[10:53:33] <shoky> tho according to your screenshot you don't have a <dd> inside <dt>
[10:53:42] <zumba_addict> so it's like <ul> <li><li>
[10:53:55] <zumba_addict> yes, i don't have which is right
[10:53:59] <zumba_addict> they're the same level
[10:54:05] <shoky> if you don't close tags its impossible to understand..
[10:54:09] <shoky> :\
[10:54:11] <zumba_addict> yeah, i got close too
[10:54:15] <zumba_addict> confussed too
[10:54:18] <shoky> saying it is not helpful
[10:54:21] <shoky> show it :\
[10:54:30] <zumba_addict> i think it should be inside. I followed a bad example
[10:54:31] <shoky> anyway usually you want
[10:54:38] <shoky> .closest(selector).find(selector)
[10:54:49] <shoky> to go up and then down
[10:55:07] <shoky> or if you just go down then just .find(selector)
[10:55:26] <zumba_addict> so like $(e.target).closest('.questions').find('.answer')
[10:55:42] <zumba_addict> actually, dd is inside dt
[10:55:45] <shoky> dont know - you didnt show your actual html.
[10:55:50] <zumba_addict> let me fix it
[10:55:52] <zumba_addict> one sec
[10:57:36] <zumba_addict> here = http://pastebin.com/RHHTYUzH
[10:57:59] <zumba_addict> so I'm clicking on dt but i'd like to add active class in dd
[10:58:13] <shoky> go for it ;]
[10:59:47] <zumba_addict> i'm trying this out   now -     $(e.target).find('.answer').addClass('active');
[11:01:04] <zumba_addict> didn't work :(
[11:01:22] <zumba_addict> my bad
[11:03:03] <zumba_addict> </dt> is being added automatically
[11:03:21] <zumba_addict> so looks like we can't put dd inside dt
[11:03:51] <zumba_addict> i'll have to make each dd unique, damn
[11:07:46] <shoky> unique?
[11:08:02] <zumba_addict> yes, because i have different dd
[11:08:13] <shoky> you can select it with .next() if it's always next sibling
[11:08:15] <zumba_addict> find will find many dd
[11:08:18] <zumba_addict> oh ok
[11:10:21] <zumba_addict> active got added
[11:10:24] <zumba_addict> finally
[11:10:40] <zumba_addict> it added it to all, hahaha
[11:10:53] <zumba_addict> i have this -   $(e.target).closest('.questions').find('.answer').addClass('active');
[11:11:02] <shoky> ...
[11:11:16] <zumba_addict> trying this now - $(e.target).closest('.questions').next('.answer').addClass('active');
[11:11:17] <shoky> we just said what you can do..
[11:11:23] <shoky> think, man
[11:11:29] <shoky> why .closest?
[11:11:29] <zumba_addict> yeah, the next
[11:11:40] <shoky> closest goes up the dom..
[11:11:41] <zumba_addict> i have to console the parent
[11:11:48] <shoky> huh?
[11:11:48] <zumba_addict> got it
[11:11:58] <zumba_addict> so .next will just check the below element?
[11:12:09] <shoky> next will go to next sibling element
[11:12:09] <zumba_addict> so i really don't have to go up the dom then
[11:12:11] <decx> next is just nextSibling
[11:12:43] <zumba_addict> cool
[11:13:06] <shoky> you don't need a selector in .next() btw
[11:13:31] <zumba_addict> works!
[11:13:34] <zumba_addict> thanks a lot!
[11:13:51] <zumba_addict> latest - $(e.target).next('.answer').addClass('active');
[11:14:00] <zumba_addict> now i need to toggle
[11:14:32] <zumba_addict> so check if e.target has active and if so, removeClass('active') right?
[11:14:36] <Uhkis> so use toggleClass
[11:14:43] <zumba_addict> oh
[11:14:47] <zumba_addict> that's nice
[11:14:54] <zumba_addict> no need for if statement
[11:15:07] <shoky> you might want to .. go through jquery docs.  just browser them
[11:15:08] <shoky> browse*
[11:15:27] <shoky> learn about helpful shit,  ask less questions here, etc ;p
[11:15:27] <decx> also the old traversal saga is old news
[11:15:41] <Uhkis> what shoky said :)
[11:16:15] <zumba_addict> works great!
[11:16:25] <zumba_addict> i will read the jquery docs, i promise
[11:16:40] <zumba_addict> thank you for your time shoky and decx
[11:17:34] <shoky> shure
[11:56:54] <rach24py> How to hide a  <div> section be hidden on pageload? what jquery function should I use for that?
[11:57:11] <robertmaxrees> rach24py couple different ways.
[11:57:37] <robertmaxrees> your safest bet would be to make a "hide" or "hidden" class in your CSS and then use .addClass() to add it.
[11:57:56] <robertmaxrees> though i have to ask why you're using jquery for that - why not just put the class on the element to begin with?
[11:57:56] <taplar> i'd have the class on the element in the markup, otherwise your going to see a flash
[11:58:08] <robertmaxrees> ^ bingo
[11:58:23] <rach24py> robertmaxrees: thanks
[11:58:42] <Uhkis> i'd have jquery do hide() so people without js will see it (assuming it needs to be seen at some point)
[11:59:00] <MassDebates> I like that one
[11:59:03] <MassDebates> ^
[11:59:28] <robertmaxrees> then don't use JS for this at all and control its visibility via css :)
[11:59:36] <robertmaxrees> :hover and whatnot are widely supported.
[11:59:50] <MassDebates> Yeah, but there's a large chance that it may not be doable with just css
[11:59:57] <robertmaxrees> also: hide/show can be a little... misleading.
[12:00:02] <MassDebates> Yeah.
[12:00:08] <MassDebates> vague
[12:00:16] <robertmaxrees> more that show may or may not actually restore the element to its original display.
[12:00:20] <robertmaxrees> it's a best guess kind of thing.
[12:00:27] <robertmaxrees> which is why adding/removing a class is your best bet.
[12:01:05] <MassDebates> I was saying vague because 'hide' isn't accurately defined in the problem's scope.
[12:01:26] <MassDebates> Hide, like 0 opacity but still holds layout and affects other box models, or like display:none?
[12:01:43] <robertmaxrees> hide sets display none, but your issue comes on the other side when you go to show the element.
[12:01:52] <Uhkis> oh right, robertmaxrees' thing was the same as mine but in a different way
[12:02:00] <Uhkis> so now i prefer robertmaxrees' solution :D
[12:02:12] <MassDebates> I like Uhkis's consideration though.
[12:02:25] <robertmaxrees> eh, you really don't need to worry about people having js disabled these days.
[12:02:35] <MassDebates> ? My friend does it religiously.
[12:02:35] <b-ot> mom way out of your league.
[12:02:47] <robertmaxrees> MassDebates why?
[12:02:55] <MassDebates> If I knew I'd be doing it too :P
[12:02:59] <robertmaxrees> heh, right.
[12:03:17] <robertmaxrees> there's really no reason to worry about disabled javascript unless you're developing for some pretty special markets.
[12:03:34] <MassDebates> yeah, you're right.
[12:03:53] <MassDebates> Besides, if you disable JS, you obviously know enough to expect what's involved with that on the web.
[12:04:13] <Uhkis> i have this one foilhatted friend who makes sure everything i do works without js :D
[12:04:28] <MassDebates> unless you're Old Man Jenkins who knows about all of the virus files named *.js
[12:04:32] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis heh they're wasting their time at this point.
[12:05:03] <MassDebates> more importantly, they're wasting more of your time than their own
[12:05:08] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:05:24] <Uhkis> afaik he has noscript addon blocking everything and he allows if needed
[12:05:29] <MassDebates> better to let rob and i waste your time :) Tell me, Uhkis, do you like kittens?
[12:05:45] <Uhkis> no! puppies ftw!
[12:05:46] <robertmaxrees> heh Uhkis he's not a normal user ;)
[12:06:05] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: network engineers are a weird folk
[12:06:08] <Moeh> How can I remove a event handler that I added like this: '$(document).on('click', '.dropdown-menu', function(e) {', by using '$(document).off('click', '.dropdown-menu')'?
[12:06:52] <robertmaxrees> Moeh yeah, but i'd try to come up with a conditional to check whether or not the logic fires instead.
[12:07:17] <taplar> .dropdown-menu.active, then remove 'active'
[12:07:23] <robertmaxrees> ^ boom.
[12:09:06] <Moeh> Well, I use the event handler in an emberjs component and want to remove it when the component gets destroyed. I guess for this I don't have to check?
[12:09:16] <robertmaxrees> no need to destroy it.
[12:09:30] <Moeh> It gets automatically destroyed when navigating away
[12:09:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:09:46] <robertmaxrees> you mean when going to another page?
[12:10:03] <Moeh> https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.6.0/components/the-component-lifecycle/#toc_detaching-and-tearing-down-component-elements-with-code-willdestroyelement-code
[12:10:04] <Moeh> yes
[12:10:10] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, no need to destroy the handler.
[12:10:29] <taplar> everything is destroyed on navigation
[12:11:34] <Moeh> So you mean even though the handler is added to "document", I don't need to remove it when the user navigates to a different page (within our site)?
[12:11:52] <robertmaxrees> is it like a normal page navigation?
[12:12:02] <Moeh> nope, an ember transition
[12:12:12] <robertmaxrees> then i wouldn't worry about it.
[12:12:18] <robertmaxrees> unless you're re-binding listeners.
[12:12:24] <robertmaxrees> which is the problem i'd fix tbh.
[12:16:07] <Moeh> okay, thanks a lot!
[12:32:20] <Yepp> I have this kind instance http://kopy.io/B5XGC#kR693KgyG20keh I was expecting it to be unique. How do I make them unique?
[12:34:09] <jierdin> searching for a front end designer/developer for a blockchain/decentralization project... PM for more details
[12:35:30] <robertmaxrees> jierdin not the right place to look :)
[12:36:07] <robertmaxrees> Yepp mind clarifying?
[12:36:31] <jierdin> do you know of a better channel on this server ?
[12:36:49] <taplar> oh
[12:36:58] <robertmaxrees> *network, and i'd look for a freelance related one.
[12:37:01] <taplar> Yepp: your probably wanting to attach that method as a prototype method
[12:37:09] <Yepp> robertmaxrees: I was expecting them not to be shared. I have a "class" that accepts an object that is going to be used for pre-filling forms
[12:37:10] <jierdin> it's 'swarm crowdfunding' - people buy crypto tokens, and can use those to vote and/or receive dividends from the project
[12:37:27] <robertmaxrees> jierdin this is a support channel for jquery, not a recruitment channel.
[12:37:35] <Yepp> my instance for creating a new resource and editing something are being shaed
[12:37:35] <robertmaxrees> that's why i'm pointing it out :)
[12:37:37] <Yepp> shared
[12:37:50] <taplar> Foo.prototype.def = function() { console.log(this.abc); };
[12:38:56] <taplar> ##javascript
[12:39:08] <Yepp> thanks taplar
[12:39:20] <robertmaxrees> Yepp i'd read up on constructor functions.
[12:39:40] <Yepp> thanks also robertmaxrees, now I can find what I really need.
[12:39:45] <robertmaxrees> also: if you want a more "class-like" system, check out es2015 and babel.
[12:39:58] <robertmaxrees> babel will let you support the new class syntax in js.
[12:41:56] <rach24py> how to access the val of different element of the same id? or is it not possible?
[12:42:04] <taplar> ids must be unique
[12:42:04] <robertmaxrees> rach24py that's not valid.
[12:42:07] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[12:42:13] <robertmaxrees> can't share IDs between elements.
[12:42:13] <taplar> they are unique ids
[12:42:30] <robertmaxrees> hard to "identify" something when the identifier isn't unique :)
[12:42:39] <taplar> like two peeps with the same drivers license
[12:43:18] <rach24py> robertmaxrees: Thanks. Then my question become "how to access the val of two id, if either of them is non-empty?"
[12:43:29] <robertmaxrees> rach24py huh?
[12:43:34] <robertmaxrees> can you show us what you're trying to do?
[12:44:47] <kneekoo> rach24py: checking the values for two IDs is easy but what if both are non-empty? what value would you want then?
[12:46:01] <rach24py> robertmaxrees: sorry, let me rephrase, "how to access the val of the non-empty element  of the 2 element ids, (at any point, only 1 of them can be non-empty)?"
[12:46:10] <robertmaxrees> so they're inputs?
[12:46:13] <rach24py> yes
[12:46:39] <robertmaxrees> and if they're both populated?
[12:46:55] <rach24py> cannot happen
[12:47:44] <robertmaxrees> you using es6?
[12:47:49] <rach24py> nope
[12:48:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd probably .map() over the values and then .filter() and go from there.
[12:48:32] <robertmaxrees> or flip those.
[12:49:28] <vmonteco> qs = Model.objects.filter([...]) in your python code and {% for elem in qs.all %} in your template?
[12:49:43] <robertmaxrees> wut
[12:49:52] <robertmaxrees> this is jquery.
[12:49:55] <vmonteco> Ooops sorry :S accidently changed chan.
[12:49:58] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:50:23] <rach24py> robertmaxrees: I have 2 search forms (they are essentially the same val, however different locations on the page, hence different ids) , either form can be filled, then submitted and queried. does it make it clearer?
[12:50:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:50:36] <robertmaxrees> i already gave you a solution.
[12:50:38] <robertmaxrees> what's the confusion?
[12:51:26] <robertmaxrees> here, have a freebie: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z731y9mf/1/
[12:51:26] <taplar> $(selector).filter(function(){ return this.value.trim().length; }).val()
[12:51:47] <robertmaxrees> taplar's is a safter check for whitespace.
[12:52:39] <rach24py> Thanks Robert.
[12:53:31] <rach24py> thanks taplar.
[12:53:47] <taplar> *thumbs up*
[12:53:53] <taplar> wish chat has emotes
[12:54:03] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z731y9mf/5/ here's the lolsy version.
[12:56:01] <rach24py> Robertmaxrees : taplar: :)
[13:21:52] <lulul> guys can u help me fix ($this).parent().remove() in the following code  http://notey.it/n/dGVw ? it doesn't remove the field when i click on it
[13:23:38] <robertmaxrees> 'this' isn't what you think it is.
[13:24:36] <taplar> some jedi shit right there
[13:24:40] <lulul> robertmaxrees mhm
[13:25:08] <robertmaxrees> need to either pass the element explicitly or use .call()
[13:25:12] <robertmaxrees> i'd go with the former.
[13:25:13] <lulul> can you detail a little so i can learn a little more about it ? :D
[13:25:33] <robertmaxrees> honestly, i'd just pass the event.target
[13:25:59] <MassDebates> holy shit rob
[13:26:03] <MassDebates> I'm putting that on a t-shirt
[13:26:10] <MassDebates> "This" isn't what you think it is.
[13:26:17] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[13:26:22] <lulul> =)))
[13:26:46] <taplar> "this isn't that, cause that isn't even a thing"
[13:27:16] <MassDebates> Hmm, what about
[13:27:18] <Uhkis> MassDebates: and self = this; in the back?
[13:27:49] <MassDebates> eh,
[13:28:39] <MassDebates> Im beginning to realize it's not going to be as good as my other code shit I made
[13:29:14] <taplar> huh?
[13:29:14] <MassDebates> I had this printed: http://stackoverflow.com/a/766363/6177319 (a bit different formatting though)
[13:29:21] <MassDebates> code shirt*
[13:29:25] <taplar> lol
[13:29:34] <MassDebates> wow, that's an incredibly inconvenient typo.
[13:30:28] <lulul> MassDebates show a picture =d
[13:32:48] <MassDebates> It's at my girlfriend's mom's house. My washer is broken.
[13:32:54] <MassDebates> I'll take a picture tomorrow. Will you be on?
[13:32:57] <lulul> yeah =D
[13:33:01] <MassDebates> Great!
[13:34:25] <vmonteco> jbitcm-: Nothing I said something wrong. To make it simple, If you do something like Model.objects.all(), you don't get a Model instance but a queryset containing the instances of Model. What if you try Model.objects.all()[0]?
[13:34:45] <vmonteco> Damnit! Sorry :S
[14:01:12] <navi___>  I have this site http://goo.gl/YN2Sgu . I want to know that how can I add some extra css class for the menu item which is currently active. through javascript/jquery?
[14:01:40] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:01:47] <robertmaxrees> you mean add an extra class?
[14:01:51] <navi___> yes.
[14:01:53] <robertmaxrees> .addClass() with jquery is one way.
[14:01:54] <navi___> css class
[14:01:55] <MassDebates> why not use things like .addClass() and .removeClass()
[14:02:08] <robertmaxrees> there's no such thing as "css class" btw.
[14:02:20] <robertmaxrees> there are classes, which can be used by CSS and JS.
[14:02:50] <navi___> but I want it dynamically. mean when user e.g. click home page then 'home' should get that active class, if user click contact page then 'contact' should only get that active class
[14:03:04] <robertmaxrees> that's called an event listener.
[14:04:03] <MassDebates> navi___:  are you using a CMS of sorts?
[14:04:16] <navi___> custom php
[14:04:48] <robertmaxrees> oh, you mean opn pageload?
[14:04:52] <robertmaxrees> like, by default?
[14:05:01] <navi___> yes
[14:05:06] <robertmaxrees> do that in your backend.
[14:05:09] <robertmaxrees> not with js.
[14:05:13] <MassDebates> ^
[14:05:27] <navi___> is it not possible with js?
[14:05:37] <robertmaxrees> it's possible, but the wrong tool.
[14:05:39] <MassDebates> it is, but that's not what you want to do
[14:05:58] <navi___> what do you mean? I didn't get your point
[14:05:58] <MassDebates> FINE ROB, MAKE ME LOOK LAME AND SLOW
[14:06:00] <MassDebates> xD
[14:06:21] <robertmaxrees> navi___ you don't want to use javascript for default things like that.
[14:06:25] <MassDebates> navi___:  To do what you're trying to do with javascript/jquery would take a lot less time, effort, and be better if you did it in a different way.
[14:06:30] <MassDebates> Gyarr..
[14:06:35] <MassDebates> lol rob
[14:07:01] <robertmaxrees> it's like using a screwdriver as a hammer: you can do it, but you'd be better served if you just used a hammer.
[14:07:26] <navi___> oh okay. but actually I want to do this with js. I want to learn this way too.
[14:07:28] <MassDebates> Oh! That's a great analogy. Scribbling that one down.
[14:08:29] <robertmaxrees> "i want to learn how to do this the wrong way"
[14:08:31] <MassDebates> navi___:  you'd include a script that fires on pageload (or whatever trigger you prefer) and have it use .addClass (and others) on the elements in question, adding the class which has the styling of an active link.
[14:09:12] <robertmaxrees> if you'd like to learn jquery fwiw: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/
[14:09:14] <MassDebates> navi___:  but that's a lot of time and effort for something that can be done much more easily. Not only htat, but doing this may very well break other things on your site that would have worked otherwise.
[14:09:16] <robertmaxrees> this is a pretty solid guide.
[14:09:28] <MassDebates> i also like try.jquery
[14:10:31] <navi___> what if I read a string from url and then apply the css class to that menu item whose text is equal to that url string?
[14:10:46] <robertmaxrees> navi___ that's possible.
[14:10:56] <robertmaxrees> but again, you'll be much better served by using php.
[14:10:59] <navi___> okay great. thanks
[14:11:09] <MassDebates> navi___:  why not just use CSS for these things?
[14:11:19] <navi___> yeah I know the php way. but I want to try with js
[14:11:24] <robertmaxrees> technically they WILL use CSS regardless.
[14:11:25] <MassDebates> navi___:  you can do it with pure CSS. No php, no javascript, nothing complicated.
[14:11:28] <MassDebates> ^
[14:11:30] <navi___> is it possible with pure css?
[14:11:34] <MassDebates> Very.
[14:11:41] <navi___> can you tell me how?
[14:12:23] <MassDebates> Instead of using a wrench(jquery) to hold a screwdriver(jquery-controlled-css) to pound in a nail(desired results), you can just hold the hammer(pure css) and pound it in within seconds..
[14:12:26] <MassDebates> and yes
[14:12:41] <MassDebates> 2 secs, let me look to see how you have the pages organized
[14:13:11] <navi___> ok
[14:13:42] <MassDebates> alrighty, i see it.
[14:13:51] <navi___> oky
[14:13:57] <MassDebates> There's a couple ways pure CSS can do this. Mind popping over to #css so I don't piss off these friendly jquery folks?
[14:14:40] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:36:15] <daintycode> hey there
[15:25:42] <taplar> friendly jquery folks?
[15:30:17] <bomb> I HATE YOU.
[15:41:56] <robertmaxrees> welp
[15:46:01] <taplar> lol, what a b...
[15:46:08] <taplar> bomb
[15:46:53] <taplar> makes me think of the boyz2men song
[16:19:56] <Programer> for jQuery Mobile download builder is it enough just to check PANELS if I only want to have Panels Widget that will slide on swipe....
[17:08:51] <taplar> *beat boxes* s-s-s-scope creap!
[17:09:00] <robertmaxrees> noes!
[17:09:06] <taplar> crazies
[17:24:18] <taplar> i am happy though.  finishing up two very large stories today, :)
[17:24:33] <robertmaxrees> that's awesome.
[17:24:37] <robertmaxrees> always feels really good.
[17:25:01] <taplar> oh yeah. ready to tackle the next one
[21:11:25] <alturic> Hey guys, if I had a select, and I'm using some of the <option>s as nothing more than a category listing and the other <option>s would have class="zipcodes", is there anyway to use .change and only fire when the .change'd option had the zipcodes class?
[21:12:57] <alturic> So imagine there was one <option class="onchangedontgetvalue"> and then 5 other <option class="onchangegetvalue">, is there anyway to not have the .change fire on the first one?
[21:15:51] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/optgroup
[21:18:20] <alturic> It doesn't seem like there's a way to nest optgroup's? Yea... client would want it at State (optgroup) => County (nested optgroup) => zipcodes (option)
[21:18:50] <alturic> So in terms of how the drop-down currently looks (with all of them being an option)
[21:18:53] <alturic> California
[21:18:59] <alturic> -County
[21:19:01] <alturic> --zipcode
[21:20:07] <taplar> your going to have a dropdown that that much info?
[21:20:15] <taplar> :s
[21:20:19] <alturic> Yea...
[21:21:17] <taplar> personally it would make more sense to have one for each one, and ajax get the nested selects when the parent changes
[21:22:24] <alturic> Just to "make sense" of it, the drop-down is being used to ajax in data, and while drop-downs are (for a reason I can't really understand) considered terrible from a UX stand-point, you can only list the "selectors" (<option>s in this case) as a drop-down, a bunch of insanely silly looking text, or buttons
[21:22:51] <taplar> dropdowns aren't bad ux if they make sense
[21:22:59] <taplar> if there are a lot of options, it gets bad
[21:23:11] <alturic> What other options are there, when you have a lot of options....
[21:23:24] <alturic> It seems like the opposite is true to be completely honest.
[21:23:32] <taplar> most of the time i see auto completes
[21:23:46] <alturic> Imagine a form not using a drop-down for the state field, or country field.
[21:23:52] <taplar> sure
[21:24:09] <alturic> Yea, I hear ya. It's just the implementation is one of "click the single drop-down, select the zipcode you want to ajax in the data from.
[21:24:12] <taplar> you start typing in C, a, l and it does ajax calls to pull back the one taht matches
[21:25:03] <taplar> but are you planning on having a dropdown with every zipcode possible?
[21:25:09] <alturic> nooooo
[21:25:21] <alturic> Oh god no man, that'd be ~42k zipcodes
[21:25:21] <alturic> hehe
[21:25:25] <taplar> :)
[21:25:52] <alturic> Basically, the zipcodes are tied to a product. So sure, if the person has 1 product, it WOULD be silly to list is as State=>County=>ZIP, but so be it on that front.
[21:26:24] <alturic> It's an odd thing as explaining it, I give you that, but yea. :P
[21:28:10] <taplar> hmm, well lets see
[21:29:29] <taplar> maybe something like http://jqueryui.com/selectmenu/ , the "Select a file" example.  maybe you can nest those groups.  dunno, never tried
[21:29:57] <alturic> Like I said, I have a "working" way the client wants, but ANY of the options work on .change of course. I thought for sure there'd be a way to (select#zipcodedropdown option.fireonavalidoption) and then the zipcode <option>s would have the class fireonavalidoption
[21:30:32] <taplar> the select changes, the options don't
[21:30:39] <taplar> the options are possibly clicked
[21:30:47] <alturic> True true
[21:34:09] <alturic> Ahh, I think THAT way might work since they are ul and li's, and then I can just grab on an li clicked class.
[21:34:18] <alturic> Something to look at anyway, thanks for the feedback. :)
[21:34:25] <taplar> sure
[21:36:23] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/wfw70ae4/  heh, that's silly
[21:42:20] <alturic> Well, it's probably terrible, but I'm using if ($.isNumeric(changedoption) { //do ajax stuff }
[21:42:47] <alturic> Seems to work fine, and since no zipcodes are not numeric... I don't see any potential issues outside of people hating if statements.
[21:43:10] <taplar> who hates if statements?
[21:43:27] <alturic> Well, the PHP guys usually cringe when you talk about if statements.
[21:43:35] <taplar> :s
[21:43:53] <alturic> I tend to get the rumblings from a decent chunk of people "if you have to use an if youre doing it wrong" mentality.
[21:43:58] <taplar> lol, i've yet to see a script that didn't have some form of a conditional
[21:44:05] <taplar> that's crazy
[21:44:13] <alturic> I guess I can see it, it's way to easy to fall into a trap of using if statements all over the place.
[21:44:31] <taplar> you logic just needs to make sense
[21:44:37] <taplar> small, readable, and make sense
[21:44:48] <taplar> use of if or any other conditional is just a part of that
[21:45:47] <alturic> This is the one they like posting: https://i.imgur.com/BtjZedW.jpg
[21:46:01] <taplar> sure, cause that's stupid
[21:46:18] <taplar> anything can be taken to an extreme that is bad
[21:46:48] <alturic> And at leas thte first few, I totally understand why you would do it... I don't play with preg_match and stuff to see if that's logical or not, but check if the username was posted? password used alrady? the length? Perhaps it's a matter of that could be done at the form level outside of php... but still. :-/
[21:47:26] <taplar> it's just too much in one method
[21:47:33] <taplar> it needs to be split up (that example)
[21:47:41] <alturic> But my thinking if why in the hell would you be checking all that stuff at the php level anyway, but again I don't think it's a matter of what level you're doing the checks, I think the point is "that's just idiocity in terms of ifs"
[21:47:56] <taplar> you have to do those checks on the backend
[21:48:01] <taplar> you can't trust the user
[21:48:19] <alturic> SOME of those checks would need to be done on the back-end...
[21:48:23] <taplar> all
[21:48:31] <taplar> javascript is not for security
[21:48:51] <alturic> How-so? Checking the form if it's empty? Checking if the password is empty? Checking the length?
[21:48:59] <alturic> I'm not trying to be obtuse, honestly, but...
[21:49:09] <taplar> are you asking why they can't be done in js?
[21:49:30] <taplar> or just the number of conditionals it checks?
[21:49:31] <alturic> Why SHOULDN'T those type be done in JS.
[21:49:37] <taplar> cause you can't trust the user
[21:49:44] <alturic> The ones checking if email is empty, password is empty...
[21:50:06] <taplar> any slightly competent user can use their dev tools and fk your world up if you don't have checks on the back
[21:50:12] <taplar> you can't trust them
[21:50:18] <alturic> Ahh, I think I see what you're saying, yea they can just alter the post.
[21:50:51] <taplar> now if your arguing why it's checking empty and < 6, sure you could argue you could condense those
[21:51:12] <taplar> just a matter at that point of which is more user friendly, *shrug*
[21:53:59] <alturic> Can you give a quick 1 or 2 sentence why that if block is still illogical? Unless I'm severely mis-understanding if statements, it proceeds to the next condition if the previous passed, if not it stops altogether on the first fail, no? I know you said it's "too much", but they all have to be done anyway, no?
[21:54:01] <alturic> :-/
[21:54:51] <alturic> What's the difference if I take my garbage out one bag at a time, every hour versus all bags at once? The end result still needs to be all bags get taken out.
[21:55:07] <taplar> the code smell with that method is that it is attempting to do a lot of logic in one place.  this makes it hard to read, follow, and understand
[21:55:41] <alturic> The error messages get hard to read, hell yea. Reading down-ward is easy enough, for me anyway. Perhaps I'm getting to the point of falling into the if trap! ha
[21:55:55] <taplar> were as if it was broken up, it would increase readability which promotes not only understanding but conveys to the programmer the intent of the code
[21:56:13] <taplar> if you know the intent, you have an easier time determining if it is broken
[21:56:25] <taplar> or if you go to change something, if it is counter to the intent
[21:56:33] <taplar> so you stop and ask questions first
[21:56:36] <alturic> Yea, I'm a freak about formatting my code constantly. heh
[21:56:48] <spoonUltra> if a directory only has velocity.js can I use .click and .hover the same way I would with jquery?
[21:57:51] <taplar> like if i was to rewrite that method it would look something like
[21:59:07] <taplar> if ( $this->userNameIsValid( $_POST[ 'user_name' ] &&  $this->passwordIsValid( $_POST[ 'user_password_new' ] &&  $this->emailIdValid( $_POST[ 'user_email' ]) { /* do stuff */ }
[21:59:27] <taplar> crap, left off a closing ) on the methods, but you get the idea
[21:59:48] <taplar> from reading that line, i know what it's doing
[22:00:01] * spoonUltra can't find it on google
[22:00:01] <taplar> if i'm interested in how it is doing each piece, then i go read those functions
[22:00:42] <taplar> spoonUltra: i'm not familiar with velocity.js .  try and see?
[22:01:28] <spoonUltra> T_T it no werk
[22:02:52] <taplar> looks like velocity.js is just an animating plugin
[22:03:18] <spoonUltra> it's a javascript library, no?
[22:03:48] <taplar> lots of javascript libraries, doesn't mean it uses jQuery
[22:03:59] <taplar> "jquery.velocity.js has been renamed to velocity.js since  Velocity no longer requires jQuery to function. If you are still using  jQuery with Velocity, you do not need to change anything in your code;  Velocity will behave exactly as it always has."
[22:04:25] <spoonUltra> :O
[22:04:32] <taplar> so no, the latest doesn't use jQuery anymore
[22:04:34] <spoonUltra> in the name of davy jones
[22:10:25] <taplar> alturic: so with that if block as it is, what do those php guys suggest as an alternative?
[23:11:33] <cornernote> hey all
[23:12:07] <cornernote> i am using jquery-ui, and without doing anything special tooltips seem to be enabled, and i can't seem to find a way to disable them
[23:12:24] <cornernote> i do want them on specific elements, but not everything with a title attribute
[23:13:27] <taplar> do you see in your logic where your doing $(selector).tooltip(); ?
[23:14:13] <cornernote> i didnt do $(selector).tooltip();  it seems to automatically do it
[23:14:41] <cornernote> unless there is some other JS that did it and I didnt see it...  let me try a minimal example
[23:15:49] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/sndks9v9/
[23:16:05] <taplar> if it is showing on all of them, then there should be a tooltip() call some where that is acting on all of them
[23:16:25] <cornernote> yes, you are correct... now to go find it :)
[23:16:39] <cornernote> thanks
[23:16:44] <taplar> sure
[23:19:55] <cornernote> yeah, that was it... the theme i was using had something in it to enable tooltips
