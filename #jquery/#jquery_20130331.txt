[00:00:04] <diverdude> dblosevn, can jquery validation use such speech bubbles?
[00:00:06] <dblosevn> it already is
[00:00:24] <dblosevn> @ anirvana
[00:00:36] <dblosevn> diverdude: im sure with some styling
[00:01:19] <dblosevn> diverdude: this was my first clue to run lol //I still don't know regex
[00:01:48] <dblosevn> diverdude: line 391
[00:01:48] <diverdude> dblosevn, what should regex be required for that?
[00:02:03] <dblosevn> to do validations...
[00:02:17] <dblosevn> why wouldnt you use regex
[00:02:27] <diverdude> ah
[00:02:40] <diverdude> line 391 in what file?
[00:02:52] <dblosevn> jquery.ketchup.js
[00:03:31] <dblosevn> thats far more resourceintensive then a one line regex would be
[00:03:34] <diverdude> dblosevn, haha
[00:03:39] <diverdude> yeah
[00:03:44] <diverdude> ok now i understand what you mean
[00:04:11] <diverdude> if the dev dont even know regex.....that lib might not be very reliable
[00:04:21] <dblosevn> I started with the source being he didnt have the docs as a human eadble format in git
[00:05:23] <diverdude> hmmm is the jquery validator you talk about something that comes with jquery?
[00:05:34] <dblosevn> i question anybody that thinks tasty means valid and implys ketchup actually is tasty to begin with lmao
[00:06:06] <dblosevn> i think its part of ui
[00:06:44] <diverdude> ah ui :/ dont like that so much
[00:06:45] <anirvana> Is there any documentation on how jquery ui autcomplete sends data to the data source file? Does it send get/post parameters? what are their indices?
[00:07:05] <dblosevn> ?g jquery ui validation @ diverdude
[00:07:05] <b-ot> diverdude: Sorry, no results for ‚Äüjquery ui validation @ diverdude‚Äù.

[00:09:04] <anirvana> ok
[01:21:31] <ryorky1> how can I get an even to fire if a user hyolds down a key and then releases it?
[01:22:13] <ryorky1> for example, if a user types in normally, the event fires, but if they hold down the delete button, nothing fires
[01:26:09] <sacho> use a timer
[01:26:26] <MaSOuD> Handle the keyup event?
[01:26:40] <MaSOuD> how a timer would help?
[01:27:30] <sacho> Oh, I misunderstood his question. Or rather, I thought I understood it, but now after rereading it, I don't.
[01:34:40] <ryorky1> was missing an eklse statement in my function, problem solved, tnx guys

[03:19:20] <superdo> hi
[03:20:05] <superdo> if I have an object like { "id" : "1", "xyz": "3" } how to make an object from it? so Object { ... }
[03:20:42] <superdo> i mean when i log to console, I see Object { ... }
[03:21:51] <xec> superdo: you could try console.dir(myObject)
[03:22:02] <xec> (depending on what it is you want)
[03:22:56] <superdo> xec: of course I want it not only on console, but a data source
[03:23:33] <xec> okay? a data source to what, exactly?
[03:24:13] <xec> you say you want to make an object from an object, so i'm slightly confused:P
[03:25:15] <superdo> ok done.
[03:25:23] <superdo> JSON.parse() helped me
[03:25:47] <xec> okay. so what you had was a string, not an object :)
[03:25:59] <superdo> yes .. i try to hack a data source that backbone passes to a template parser
[03:26:12] <superdo> and I wanted to make my data the same as backbones
[03:26:47] <superdo> and that was the diff. had to parse with JSON parse mathod
[03:26:53] <superdo> thank you xec anyway
[03:55:23] <mand_> Hi
[03:55:32] <mand_> I'm using  $.mobile.loading('show'); to show a loading spinner, but it doesn't appear unless I add an alert(); afterwards, then I can actually see it
[03:55:53] <mand_> What's wrong? How can I make it actually appear?
[03:58:05] <mand_> Oh, ok, my .getJSON is not blocking
[04:28:32] <eugenmayer> Hello. Not sure the question belongs here, but ill try. Iam doing the usual plain old easy form validation und submit-button click (important thing, not on form submit). During that process, a dialog could be shown ( to fill out the missing bits ). After the user closes the dialog (and validation runs smooth i want to "click" on the submit button again
[04:29:53] <eugenmayer> the reason iam not just running $form.submit() is due to the framework behind it ( drupal ), it needs the submit-button as the "op". i guess i could us something like $form.get(0).clk = $mybutton.get(0) .. but are there any other options to delay a event from bubling after a sepcific event happens and then "rebubble" it?
[04:32:52] <eugenmayer> it basically looks like this : http://jsfiddle.net/RaAZ7/ thats the submit-button on click handler
[04:38:40] <eugenmayer> ;/
[05:26:19] <z89> is it possible to write files using jQuery.. or any other javascript framework?
[05:30:32] <army> where would you want to write them?
[07:09:36] <spobat> hi
[07:09:46] <spobat> does #2 really the same as #1 does here? http://ideone.com/Lt5mCQ
[07:10:30] <spobat> sorry: this is the link: http://ideone.com/G6yP0q
[07:33:49] <didiergm> spobat at 1st glance they are different #1 applies filterList to the (unique) element #filter1 whisslt #2 attempts to do the same for each elt with a class .filter
[07:34:03] <spobat> yep
[07:34:04] <didiergm> spobat w/o more details I can't really say more
[07:34:11] <spobat> okay
[07:34:22] <didiergm> spobat especially what is "works" and "wsorks not"
[07:34:36] <didiergm> s/wsorks/works/
[07:35:53] <spobat> the function is applied
[07:38:02] <didiergm> spobat show a larger except html + js may be as a jsfiddle ?
[07:38:36] <spobat> well I now just gave them appropriate #ids :S
[07:38:56] <spobat> (which, as it turned out I would have needed anyway)
[07:39:23] <didiergm> kk
[07:41:39] <hugo_moss> anyone know a lazy load plugin that works with magento?
[07:42:54] <Trudko> Guys simple plugin http://jsbin.com/ahoyez/1/edit why does  line console.log(cloneId); in method add  return  div object rather then  my parameter
[08:04:41] <kingbee> hi everyone, I read through a link on a google search that jQM had layout helpers for responsive design back in the day ( 1.04a ). Is it fair to say that this way was abandoned, cause I do not see any of this in JQM 1.3.0?
[08:45:19] <spirat> shoky: I want you to know I found out the solution
[08:45:23] <spirat> shoky: it is very nasty
[08:45:54] <spirat> shoky: included jquery-tools.js at the end of the file (in the footer to speed up loading), it made a call to ajaxSetup that overrode mine...
[08:46:26] <DesertFoxATX> spirat, are your javascript includes being executed async?
[08:47:14] <spirat> DesertFoxATX: no, <script src=""> isn't async AFAIK
[08:47:34] <spirat> DesertFoxATX: I had no idea I could do async includes, that might cause some troubles in this setup
[08:48:08] <DesertFoxATX> http://css-tricks.com/thinking-async/
[08:48:13] <DesertFoxATX> its alittle old article, but it was a good read.
[08:48:19] <spirat> thanks
[08:48:23] <DesertFoxATX> np.
[08:48:39] <DesertFoxATX> Gives some examples how the big boys do it.
[08:48:52] <DesertFoxATX> althought that doesn't necessarily imply its the right way lol.
[08:48:58] <spirat> however in this case the jquery-tools should be made first, so that I can override some of its stuff
[08:49:23] <spirat> that's cool, I like it! it's simple haha
[08:49:27] <DesertFoxATX> Yah you may not want asyn depending on your setup.
[08:49:31] <Trudko> guys how do I access outer function arguments object - http://jsfiddle.net/TbhjN/ ?
[08:50:00] <spirat> oh actually I have an old-school async include for google+ js
[08:50:03] <spirat> interesting
[08:50:39] <spirat> Do you people assume everyone has HTML5 support nowadays?
[09:18:36] <didiergm> spirat depends on who 'everyone' is: if general public then no; if it is a population you have control over then yes
[09:19:06] <didiergm> spirat if it is mobile devices then yes, +/- depending on the version of the browser and/or underlying os
[09:21:51] <spirat> ok
[09:22:25] <spirat> how about using html5shim from google? it magically seems to add html5 support for browsers < IE9
[09:23:09] <Gmac_> hi: new here‚Ä¶ so I'm somewhat new to jquery: i am using resize to check if the browser resizes and then I'm doing a bunch of if statements.
[09:23:10] <Gmac_> works fine
[09:23:17] <Gmac_> but: it looks messy
[09:24:22] <Gmac_> hold on ill post a codepen
[09:30:18] <Gmac_> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/klEHG
[09:30:32] <Gmac_> how can i make the js code more‚Ä¶er nicer looking?
[09:30:53] <Gmac_> I'm trying to learn how to condense my code and use objects or more functions instead of tons of if statements
[09:31:32] <tw2113> if {} elseif {} else
[09:32:04] <tw2113> forgot the closing }
[09:32:07] <tw2113> if {} elseif {} else }
[09:33:21] <Gmac_> no! i want to use json to store all the different widths and then run the function once on each of those widths. isn't that cleaner?
[09:33:36] <Gmac_> if else looks messy
[09:33:46] <Gmac_> i have like 5 of them
[09:33:55] <Gmac_> or is this the only way
[09:34:03] <Foxhoundz> Gmac_: what are you trying to do
[09:34:20] <Gmac_> i posted the cod pen above
[09:34:33] <tw2113> doesn't js have a case statement?
[09:34:39] <Foxhoundz> I just joined, Gmac_
[09:34:46] <tw2113> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/klEHG
[09:34:53] <Gmac_> i want to have jquery test the size of the page and then do stuff based on size
[09:35:06] <Gmac_> it works but i want to learn how to make the code less messy
[09:35:45] <Gmac_> i see all these nice plugins that are reusable and I want o make my code more reusable so i can use it for future projects
[09:36:01] <Gmac_> or is this as reusable as it gets?
[09:36:48] <Gmac_> its less a question on using jquery, more a question on making it easier to read and use
[09:37:44] <tw2113> reusable to me would be a function you create and pass conditions to
[09:37:47] <Gmac_> perhaps a switch statement or json...
[09:37:54] <tw2113> instead of a 1 time use if statement
[09:38:24] <Gmac_> so i would have to create a function that takes the width‚Ä¶ but different stuff happens when different width are gotten
[09:38:45] <Gmac_> how do you pros do it?
[09:38:48] <tw2113> you'd still have to conditionally act, inside the function
[09:39:05] <tw2113> but it'd make it pretty easy to pass the widths in and return or do based on that
[09:39:19] <tw2113> and functions can be called infinite amount of times
[09:39:20] <Gmac_> so the function will have all the if else statements
[09:39:35] <Gmac_> and the resize will get that function
[09:40:48] <tw2113> i guess i can't give a great answer until i know what you're trying to do in better detail
[09:42:44] <Foxhoundz> Gmac_: just stick with if/else statements
[09:42:49] <Foxhoundz> you'll save yourself a lot of headache
[09:43:13] <Gmac_> all right.
[09:43:32] <Gmac_> i was trying to be 'smart'
[09:43:57] <Trudko> Guys simple jquery plugin with method test and I want it to return some value somehow but I also want to still retun jquery object how can I do the both http://jsfiddle.net/AsfKs/2/
[09:44:53] <tw2113> Gmac_, consider this...making a function that does the if/else for you, means you don't have to type out an if/else for EVERY single time
[09:45:27] <Luke23ae> is there a proper way to remove postition/top/left after you dragged an element with jqueryUI draggable?
[09:45:41] <Luke23ae> like when you have dropped it
[09:45:51] <Luke23ae> and you don't want it to be offsetted
[10:07:02] <Gmac_> i use fancy box, a jquery plugin to load large pictures from small thumbnails.
[10:07:15] <Gmac_> I've never used it to load ajax, as I'm not even sure how
[10:07:59] <Gmac_> but on this website, (its not mine), http://creativemints.com/ the person seems to load a href that equals this:
[10:08:25] <Gmac_> <a class="various fancybox.ajax" href="/details?subj=62">
[10:08:31] <Gmac_> what sort of href is that?
[10:08:38] <Gmac_> its not  a real page
[10:09:12] <tw2113> it's a valid url
[10:09:13] <Gmac_> where is the data loading from
[10:09:18] <tw2113> the class attribute looks jacked up
[10:09:29] <Gmac_> well its what fancy box requires
[10:09:47] <Gmac_> it looks for class fancy box and applies its stuff to it when you click that link
[10:09:49] <tw2113> any time i use fancybox, i stick with pre-2.0
[10:10:01] <Gmac_> in this case it open a lightbox with that interesting url
[10:10:15] <tw2113> it's a url parameter
[10:10:32] <tw2113> $_GET['subj'] = 62
[10:10:48] <Gmac_> if i try and open creativemints/details?subj=62 i ge the main page with the loghtbox already set and opened
[10:11:16] <tw2113> where are you gettig that link markup?
[10:11:29] <Gmac_> is this hard to do? should I just stick with loading pictures. the cool thing is he can load a picture with info on the side
[10:11:40] <Gmac_> creativemints.com
[10:11:58] <Gmac_> just inspect any of the images and their anchors
[10:12:24] <yogurt_truck> Gmac_: what's confusing you here?
[10:12:30] <tw2113> looks fine to me
[10:12:39] <tw2113> when you click the link, it opens that link in the lightbox
[10:12:41] <yogurt_truck> Gmac_: the behavior you've described is how it's supposed to work
[10:12:55] <tw2113> when you visit the link directly, it won't have the click event to trigger the lightbox
[10:12:58] <Gmac_> right! how is this done
[10:13:00] <tw2113> thus why you see the image directly
[10:13:24] <tw2113> probably prevents the default click action and loads the content in the lightbox instead
[10:14:19] <tw2113> still not sure about that fancybox.ajax class
[10:14:21] <tw2113> but whatever
[10:14:36] <Gmac_> I'm creating a business directory which shows thumbnails. i want that when you click a thumbnail it open a lightbox with more info (presumably each thumbnail is a wordpress post and the lightbox shows the rest of the post)
[10:15:16] <Gmac_> i figure i need ajax to pull in the post
[10:15:42] <Gmac_> i could load all the posts but thats not needed when a user will probably only click on thumbnail
[10:15:49] <tw2113> or you could just create a link to the post, attach the fancybox attribute to the link
[10:15:51] <Gmac_> one thumbnail
[10:15:52] <tw2113> and load fancybox
[10:16:07] <Gmac_> like an iframe?
[10:16:09] <tw2113> no
[10:16:37] <tw2113> <a href="http://www.domain.com/my-link" rel="fancybox">Click me, i'm fancy</a>
[10:17:07] <Gmac_> and that won't open  new page? it will open lightbox? cool
[10:17:17] <tw2113> and if you have fancybox properly loaded, and targeting correctly any link with the rel attribute, they'd load in a fancybox model
[10:17:28] <Gmac_> got it
[10:17:42] <tw2113> check their docs and examples for more use cases
[10:17:46] <Gmac_> but it will load as ajax or an iframe? whats th difference
[10:17:59] <tw2113> i think ajax, but i'd have to check
[10:18:17] <tw2113> i hope ajax too
[10:18:21] <tw2113> iframes are a bitch too often
[10:19:41] <Gmac_> why?
[10:19:46] <Gmac_> cause you can't style them?
[10:20:31] <tw2113> among other things
[10:21:40] <Gmac_> now the harder question: if i don't want to use a lightbox and rather i want to loathe post into a div on the current page, how can i do that
[10:21:52] <Gmac_> i know I'm confusing...
[10:22:53] <yogurt_truck> Gmac_: you do the same thing fancybox does: an ajax request to get some markup and then insert that markup into your document
[10:23:15] <Gmac_> how
[10:23:27] <Gmac_> jquery load method thing
[10:24:08] <yogurt_truck> yes
[10:24:25] <Gmac_> is it hard to use?
[10:24:34] <yogurt_truck> try it and see?
[10:24:40] <yogurt_truck> Gmac_: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[10:24:50] <Gmac_> thanks
[10:25:03] <Gmac_> well ill let you know if I'm pulling my hair out and screaming
[10:25:41] <tw2113> think positive, free haircut
[10:25:43] <yogurt_truck> :)
[10:29:57] <Gmac_> hehe
[10:30:09] <Gmac_> ok so iterated it. i tried inserting a website into a div
[10:30:11] <Gmac_> didn't work
[10:30:14] <Gmac_> :(
[10:30:39] <Gmac_> $('div').load('http://www.google.com');
[10:30:43] <Gmac_> whyu not
[10:32:29] <tw2113> same origin policy
[10:32:52] <tw2113> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[10:33:25] <Gmac_> wait so an iframe can be loaded from anywhere but ajax cannot?
[10:33:27] <Gmac_> why not
[10:34:19] <Gmac_> well it worked when i replaced google with index.html...
[11:02:56] <Nightcinder> i'm ready to shoot this website

[11:05:31] <washington> is there a better way to accomplish this (e.target).parents().children("td").children(":input").not("button").each(function
[11:05:43] <washington> is there a better way to accomplish this: $(e.target).parents().children("td").children(":input").not("button").each(function
[11:08:43] <Nightcinder> loal, i just put it into an infinite loop
[11:09:33] <washington> is there a better way to accomplish this: $(e.target).parents().children("td").children(":input").not("button").each(function

[12:13:49] <anirvana> djQuery : I didn't get your question. When I click on the suggested values in the textbox, it should populate that value in the textbox, but it doesn't after I suppied my _renderItemData code
[12:13:55] <momomomomo> jsfiddle
[12:14:27] <djQuery> anirvana, becuase the ul\li do not have some thing in them that it is expecting
[12:14:32] <djQuery> most likely
[12:14:43] <djQuery>  anirvana .addClass( "ui-autocomplete ui-front" ) on the ul
[12:14:48] <djQuery> and ".ui-menu-item" on the li
[12:15:50] <djQuery> anirvana, also it appears to be placing the data in a different place than you ui-autocomplete-item
[12:15:54] <jayar> thnx tw2113
[12:18:01] <momomomomo> larzen: Go to the link at the end of this comment, and view source on the buttons that appear. Next, remove the javascript, and view the source of the buttons again. Then read http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137708/How%20to%20use%20jQuery%20UI%20widgets and http://jqueryui.com/button/ and check out http://learn.jquery.com/ . Here's the link to the site you need to manipulate: http://jsfiddle.net/ndPrv/
[12:18:39] <anirvana> djQuery : that didn't helpdjQuery: updated code http://pastebin.com/ji6mCYb3 but still the same issue
[12:19:11] <djQuery> anirvana, what are you trying to accomplish by doing this?
[12:20:14] <anirvana> djQuery : Well I just added the classes that you suggested, I have a custom renderItem because I want to display unescaped html in suggestions
[12:20:37] <djQuery> anirvana, have you looked at this? http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data
[12:21:17] <anirvana> looking now
[12:21:32] <larzen> momomomomo: if (myobject.data('ui-tabs')) alert('we have tabs!')
[12:42:38] <Guest97655> Hey, anyone familiar with jQuery Mobile's Navigation API?
[12:44:43] <momomomomo> larzen: sorry for the late response - $(this).hasClass('ui-button'));
[12:45:03] <momomomomo> you'll want that to run after the ui button class has been applied
[12:45:38] <momomomomo> $this should be your <button> (ie $('button#myButton')) - notice that it'll turn your <span> into <button> but retain the ID you set.
[12:46:50] <apollo13> can I somehow get jQuery.ajax follow an redirect from the server? I am getting error on readyState 1 -- I am not sure if I understand the spec correctly there, according to it the browser has no choice but to follow the redirect transparently, yet it fails for me

[12:54:01] <Lucaszz> Hi
[12:54:17] <Lucaszz> I have little funny issue
[12:54:17] <Lucaszz> ;p
[12:59:37] <spobat> is there a js library to quickly verify user input? In my case: a registration form (min string length, valid email?, etc.)
[13:02:01] <Gmac_> how can I grab the current url completely with everything in it? including #idname or ?stuff
[13:02:34] <Gmac_> path = window.location.pathname; //this only gets the path name but not the id at the end
[13:02:53] <Gmac_> so if the url is www.example.com/#45
[13:02:59] <Gmac_> it only gets up till the #
[13:14:47] <snkcld> how do i do css selectors on a jquery object
[13:17:48] <Eviltwin> snkcld: http://api.jquery.com/filter/ http://api.jquery.com/find/
[13:18:35] <Eviltwin> Gmac_: "" + window.location
[13:19:06] <Gmac_> that doesn't give the parameters at the end of a url
[13:19:10] <Gmac_> i want the end
[13:19:26] <Gmac_> its a page my wordpress plugin generates and i need to grab the weird ending
[13:19:27] <Eviltwin> It gives the entire URL
[13:19:29] <Eviltwin> Every time, every where
[13:19:47] <Gmac_> just wiring that?
[13:19:52] <Gmac_> ok ill try it
[13:19:58] <Gmac_> looks the same as what i had before
[13:20:02] <Gmac_> except the front of it
[13:20:09] <Eviltwin> You may also want to look at window.location.search
[13:20:21] <Eviltwin> Or window.location.hash
[13:20:28] <Eviltwin> For the ? and # portions of the URL respectively
[13:21:17] <Gmac_> search gets the end
[13:21:20] <Gmac_> but it worked!
[13:21:24] <Gmac_> window.locaiton
[13:21:28] <Gmac_> with nothing after it
[13:21:30] <Gmac_> perfect!
[13:22:58] <fnagel> Hey there
[13:23:01] <fnagel> Its possibe to extend UI widgets by using: $.widget( "ui.tooltip", $.ui.tooltip, { ... How to do this for own widgets? $.widget( "fn.myPlugin", $.fn.myPlugin, { .... seems not to work
[13:26:51] <spobat> is it within the function possible to get the $()?
[13:26:52] <spobat> $('#reg_email').keyup(function(e) {
[13:26:52] <spobat> 				
[13:26:52] <spobat>     });
[13:27:04] <spobat> nevermind,it's the e
[13:27:07] <spobat> probably
[13:27:55] <spobat> or it's the event :D
[13:31:05] <spobat> so, is it possible or should I save $('#reg_email') into a var?
[13:31:28] <Eviltwin> $(this)
[13:31:32] <Eviltwin> But it's better to save it in a var
[13:31:39] <spobat> why "better"?
[13:35:01] <spobat> is this strange? http://ideone.com/U9gyxC
[13:45:52] <Brombomb> I just found that jquery ui menu's have built in scroll capabilities.  Is there a way to show "handles" to indicate scrollability?
[13:45:53] <Brombomb> http://jsfiddle.net/brombomb/rn4rB/
[13:46:22] <Brombomb> the padding is so large to allow for a nice sized scrolling area
[14:05:41] <Quest> hey,
[14:06:34] <Quest> Which one is better, line 8 or line 27 of http://pastebin.ca/2346494 ?
[14:13:23] <Gmac_> I'm attaching an event listener to a div. but inside are some anchors. i need to make sure they still work when clicked
[14:13:31] <Gmac_> so i added this inside my click event
[14:13:32] <Gmac_> if($(evt.target).has('a[href^="http://"]'))
[14:13:39] <Gmac_> but i doesn't work
[14:22:01] <didiergm> on jquerymobile I am building pages dynamically on the fly. when going back to a pre existing page, the page is not fully enhanced e.g. a listview is not enhanced. I still create the page with a $('#id').page()  to no avail; any diea how I could force a regeneration of the page
[14:22:19] <Quest> is there an official jquery documentation or tutorial?
[14:22:42] <Brombomb> Quest: Docs: http://api.jquery.com http://learn.jquery.com
[14:23:03] <Brombomb>  http://try.jquery.com for learning the basics
[14:23:07] <vladikoff> Quest, http://api.jquery.com/ http://try.jquery.com/ http://learn.jquery.com/
[14:23:29] <Quest> great. thanks Brombomb  vladikoff
[14:23:37] <Quest> Which one is better, line 8 or line 27 of http://pastebin.ca/2346494 ?
[14:23:49] <Brombomb> it's in the channel message if you ever forget
[14:24:10] <Quest> k
[14:24:33] <Brombomb> I think it depends what you are goign for and trying to do
[14:24:57] <Brombomb> I'm partial to 27
[14:25:09] <Quest> Brombomb,  why so
[14:25:24] <Brombomb> but I think 8 can be useful for promises
[14:25:24] <Quest> Brombomb,  partial means you prefer 27 ?
[14:25:28] <Brombomb> yes
[14:25:44] <Quest> whats the basic difference and advantage?
[14:26:02] <Brombomb> I'm not really an "expert" so take this with a large grain of salt
[14:26:25] <Brombomb> 27 is hey I want to call an ajax function right now, and when it comes back this is what I want to do
[14:26:36] <Brombomb> it keeps you code all grouped together and succint
[14:26:45] <Quest> hm
[14:26:52] <Brombomb> *succinct
[14:27:29] <Brombomb> Line 8 is useful in a scenario where I may want to call 3 ajax calls, and only when all three are done, can I begin to process data
[14:28:46] <Brombomb> http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[14:29:09] <Quest> Brombomb,  line 8 can serve just one call also. why 2 are or more are kept in mind
[14:29:44] <Brombomb> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/
[14:30:14] <Quest> hm
[14:30:32] <Brombomb> it can
[14:30:44] <Brombomb> line 8 is also extending an object
[14:30:50] <Brombomb> so it needs to be explicitly called
[14:30:55] <Brombomb> (I think)
[14:31:03] <Quest> i see
[14:31:08] <Brombomb> whereas 27 will automatically be called once the ajax is complete
[14:31:17] <Brombomb> (I know that for sure)
[14:31:23] <Quest> so line 8 is if we have multiple requests in the same page?
[14:32:07] <Quest> right Brombomb
[14:32:40] <Quest> ?
[14:32:54] <Brombomb> to me its if you need it to execute immediatly or if it needs some kind of logic to determine when/if to process
[14:33:00] <Quest> some sort of ques in asynch
[14:33:13] <Brombomb> you can use either to make multiple requests per page
[14:34:34] <Quest> hm
[14:35:02] <Quest> request.done(function(msg)  tells it to process?
[14:35:31] <Brombomb> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[14:35:38] <Quest> k
[14:36:02] <Brombomb> so you can queue up multiple functions to process on a given request
[14:36:44] <Quest> oh. .done is to execute something when the ajax call is successfull
[14:37:07] <Brombomb> if you think you need synchronous requests, then you should move to deferred/promises
[14:37:13] <Brombomb> yes
[14:37:35] <Quest> Brombomb,  I have to study what synch and ansynch really means in js
[14:37:47] <Brombomb> samething it usually means...
[14:38:19] <Quest> Brombomb,  but I can confirm that the page has to send mulptiple requests and recieve muliple at the same time
[14:38:21] <Brombomb> a synch ajax request means it will wait for the requst to go out to the server and come back before moving on
[14:38:45] <Quest> line 27. success: function (result) { alert("successful!"); }    like there should be a failure : method too?
[14:39:19] <Quest> are these bots ^
[14:39:30] <Brombomb> it's "error" but yes same thing
[14:39:54] <Quest> Brombomb,  error? what is
[14:40:58] <Brombomb> the "failure method"  is error: function(jqXHR, textStatus) { alert(textStatus); }
[14:41:36] <Brombomb> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ look for "error"
[14:41:49] <Quest> oh ok. thats not usually described / stated in most examples. only success : is
[14:43:14] <Quest> Brombomb,  alert is the function called on successful ajax call . what is "result" in this success: function (result) { alert("successful!"); } ?
[14:43:33] <Gmac_> how can I see if event.target has a href that start with #
[14:44:13] <Brombomb> result is the data returned by the server.  Usually JSON, but could be html
[14:44:44] <Gmac_> if(!$(evt.target).is('a[href^="#"]')) return;
[14:44:48] <Gmac_> why won't that work.
[14:45:06] <Gmac_> i don't want anchors to fire unless they have a pound symbiol
[14:45:17] <Gmac_> and this is inside a click event
[14:45:33] <Brombomb> Gmac_: if($(event.target).attr('href').indexOf('#') === 0)
[14:45:46] <Quest> Brombomb,  result is the same thing as is "msg" in  request.done(function(msg) {                   $("#mybox").html(msg);       ?
[14:45:55] <Brombomb> yes
[14:46:04] <Quest> oh
[14:46:16] <Gmac_> why can't i use my statement? it works without negation
[14:46:16] <Brombomb> Gmac_: is the non css3 way to do it
[14:46:25] <Quest> Brombomb,  so it can be named anything. result/outcum/mytextfetched
[14:46:30] <Gmac_> when i add negation in the beginning it stops working
[14:46:57] <Brombomb> I'm not up to speed on my CSS3 selectors.  I fall back to basics
[14:47:23] <Brombomb> Quest: function(dataFromServerCanBeNamedWhatever) {
[14:47:31] <Gmac_> well how can I say is not?
[14:47:52] <Brombomb> if($(event.target).attr('href').indexOf('#') !== 0
[14:48:07] <Quest> Brombomb,  great! thanks a lot!
[14:48:32] <Brombomb> indexor you mean in CSS3 Gmac_ ?
[14:48:32] <Gmac_> ill use it if I can't figure out the css selector version‚Ä¶ I'm using is('a[href^="#"]')
[14:48:49] <Gmac_> which works but i can't negate it
[14:49:10] <Gmac_> href^= means if it starts with pound
[14:50:49] <Brombomb> about .not('a[href^="#"]')
[14:51:24] <Gmac_> nope not working
[14:52:22] <Gmac_> i basically have a div which slide down on click
[14:52:48] <Gmac_> inside it are some anchors. some have href that go places and for those i don't want it sliding. i want it going to that page
[14:55:27] <Brombomb> can you paste your statement again
[15:01:31] <Gmac_> sorry. i have a class click which slidetoggles
[15:02:04] <Gmac_> $('.click').on('touchstart click', function(evt){
[15:02:04] <Gmac_>     //dont slide if i click an anchor inside that goes somewhere
[15:02:06] <Gmac_>    
[15:02:07] <Gmac_>     //if($(evt.target).is('a[href^="http://"]')) maybe just use this
[15:02:09] <Gmac_>     if($(evt.target).not('a[href^="#"]'))
[15:02:10] <Gmac_>      return;
[15:02:10] <Gmac_>     
[15:03:18] <Brombomb> Gmac_: can you use jsfillde or pastebin to show all the code
[15:03:25] <Gmac_> ok
[15:03:38] <Brombomb> just the function is fine
[15:04:40] <Gmac_> ill do you one better
[15:04:42] <Gmac_> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1090829/inmonsey/index.html
[15:05:00] <Gmac_> now make the browser real narrow so you get my mile menu up top
[15:05:05] <Gmac_> mobile
[15:05:37] <Gmac_> then click you ail see menu items. classifieds is the only one that actually goes somewhere as of now
[15:06:17] <Brombomb> I see the bacl bar mobile menu, but clicking on it doesn't work in Chrome
[15:06:47] <Gmac_> nope because I'm using not and it doesn't wokr
[15:06:52] <Gmac_> i put it back to is
[15:06:54] <Gmac_> refresh
[15:07:21] <Gmac_> notice how classifieds does not go anywhere
[15:07:38] <Gmac_> stopPropagation doesn't work either
[15:08:26] <Brombomb> what script is this in?
[15:09:15] <Gmac_> inmonsey.js
[15:09:23] <Brombomb> line?
[15:09:29] <Gmac_> at bottom
[15:09:44] <Gmac_> last click event
[15:09:50] <Brombomb> ok
[15:10:25] <Gmac_> right now its not working cause its only looking for https
[15:10:35] <Gmac_> i have it set to work if it starts with http
[15:10:46] <Gmac_> but i want anything but # to work
[15:12:16] <Gmac_> that would be better
[15:18:09] <Brombomb> I'm not sure that your a tag is generating a click event
[15:18:23] <snkcld> thats interesting, $.inArray returns a -1 if its not in the array, so you can't really use it like "if ($.inArray(Ö))"
[15:18:48] <Brombomb> that's becuase array's are 0-indexed based
[15:19:07] <Brombomb> so if it's found at the first index it returns a 0
[15:19:25] <Gmac_> which tg/
[15:19:28] <Gmac_> ?
[15:19:30] <Brombomb> just add a !== -1 and you'll be all set
[15:19:45] <Brombomb> Gmac_: you 'a' tags in the mobile menu
[15:20:07] <Gmac_> they are‚Ä¶ i mean when you click them the div slides up
[15:20:20] <Brombomb> but thats becuase you're clicking the div
[15:20:28] <Brombomb> the div exapnds and it's all encompassing
[15:20:30] <Gmac_> ok right.
[15:20:39] <Gmac_> so why won't they change locations
[15:20:50] <Gmac_> how can I get it to do that
[15:24:15] <Brombomb> your return false on line 143 is the issue
[15:24:34] <Brombomb> that's canceling the page nav
[15:26:02] <melissa_2> hi guys
[15:26:11] <melissa_2> there is a way to capture the sound coming from the mic with jquery?
[15:27:12] <Gmac_> thank you!
[15:27:19] <Gmac_> i thought i needed that
[15:27:32] <Gmac_> see i have tis flag because it was firing twice on an ipad...
[15:27:37] <Gmac_> now i have to go test it on the ipad
[15:28:15] <Brombomb> melissa_2: what for?  I really don't think so....
[15:28:43] <melissa_2> no? uhmmmm bummer

[15:31:29] <melissa_2> one more help please!
[15:31:39] <melissa_2> Do you know how can I detect the 100% of the mic volume?
[15:31:47] <melissa_2> I see the mike.on('data', function (data) {     /* do something with data */ });
[15:31:52] <melissa_2> I guess I should be doing it there
[15:32:01] <melissa_2> but how do I detect the volume the input has?
[15:32:23] <Brombomb> never used either.  Just found them through google > stack overflow
[15:34:03] <Gmac_> so why does that stack overflow page say to put return false at the end
[15:35:06] <Brombomb> well that prevents "propagation"
[15:35:26] <Brombomb> I couldn't wire up a click event to those a tags for some reason....
[15:39:21] <Gmac_> they don't have click events. only the outer div, but  why was false not letting them work? i don't get any of this...

[16:26:16] <Mission> IS there anythin wrong with this? $('#navigation li').hover(function () { $(this + " .submenu").css('display', 'block'); });
[16:26:18] <Mission> ?
[16:26:48] <Mission> It doesn't seem to work for some reason
[16:27:56] <b-lew> anyone helping out today? I need help with a function.
[16:31:08] <tw2113> b-lew, it's better to just throw the question out there
[16:31:43] <b-lew> tw2113: deal!
[16:31:50] <Mission> tw2113,
[16:31:57] <tw2113> instead of twiddling your thumbs waiting for someone who could *maybe* help
[16:31:58] <b-lew> http://bvh.delineamultimedia.com/?page_id=2¬†-> if you click the first image there is a gallery. when you close it something happens (i don't know what) but then re-open it again and its a static image. I'm just running a function
[16:32:09] <b-lew> http://pastie.org/7236203¬†-> i left some white space around where i'm working on line 46
[16:32:20] <Quest> Which one is better, line 8 or line 27 of http://pastebin.ca/2346494 ? any one want to comment?
[16:32:33] <b-lew> its just run that function each time. no reason for that to be any different on 2nd load.
[16:32:55] <Mission> tw2113, the this part
[16:33:04] <Mission> Didn't seem to work for some strane reason
[16:33:19] <Mission> Could it be because the it's actually a which it is over?
[16:33:24] <Mission> "a"
[16:33:30] <tw2113> "this" refers to the context of the current selector, or in your case, the sole item that was clicked
[16:33:47] <Mission> Yes
[16:34:05] <Mission> But, when I type it out, it works
[16:34:18] <Mission> When I use "this" it doesn't work
[16:34:32] <Mission> I'll post it on jsfiddle for you
[16:34:35] <tw2113> k
[16:35:33] <Mission> http://jsfiddle.net/Lf82F/
[16:35:36] <Mission> Second bar
[16:35:43] <Mission> Sorry for it being in Russian?
[16:35:54] <Mission> No idea why I placed question mark there
[16:36:20] <tw2113> how is it not working?
[16:36:35] <Mission> It's not folding out?
[16:36:38] <Mission> The submenu
[16:36:46] <tw2113> ah yeah
[16:37:08] <Mission> But when you put '#navigation li' instead of "this" it does actually work
[16:38:08] <tw2113> Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [object HTMLLIElement] .submenu
[16:38:26] <Mission> *facepalm*
[16:38:27] <tw2113> curious question, why are you using js to do a submenu?
[16:38:59] <Mission> Well, can you use anything else to make it on hover?
[16:39:04] <tw2113> css
[16:39:06] <Mission> Rather than on click?
[16:39:18] <Mission> Ohh
[16:39:25] <Mission> Uhmm...
[16:39:50] <Mission> Yeah, that's a curious question I ask myself now
[16:39:51] <Mission> :D
[16:51:30] <newcode_> can anybody help with this http://jsfiddle.net/f9yww/2/
[16:52:08] <Brombomb> what do you need help with?
[16:52:46] <newcode_> with both total calculations
[16:54:08] <Brombomb> http://jsfiddle.net/brombomb/f9yww/3/
[16:54:12] <Brombomb> needs a .val()
[16:54:20] <Brombomb> lines 23 and 24
[16:55:02] <Brombomb> ?val
[16:55:02] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[16:56:02] <newcode_> Brombomb: how can i get the acumulated values in the below total?
[16:59:23] <Brombomb> What I'd do it select the tableTotal inputs, use .each to iterate over them and add their values together, then write the total val to the total input
[17:00:27] <newcode_> umm ok
[17:00:36] <newcode_> ill give it a try
[17:03:00] <Brombomb> let me know if you get stuck
[17:06:54] <newcode_> Brombomb:  check if this is going fine http://jsfiddle.net/f9yww/4/
[17:07:15] <Brombomb> I'm having some network issues... give me a sec
[17:08:49] <Brombomb> hmm you're missing something
[17:08:56] <Brombomb> ahhh
[17:09:00] <Brombomb> line 34
[17:09:07] <Brombomb> use .val(total....
[17:09:14] <Brombomb> instead of .text
[17:10:06] <Brombomb> and I think you're using the wrong field... you want the total/imp field not price field...
[17:10:35] <Brombomb> so move your class but otherwise that looks right
[17:12:45] <newcode_> Brombomb:  yeah.. typing error. Thanks for your help
[17:13:44] <Brombomb> no problem
[17:35:24] <Underflow> Hi there
[17:36:43] <Underflow> I've a problem with jquery Mobile 1.2.1, in my verry short test the listview doesn't work : http://ege.underflow.fr
[17:37:05] <Underflow> What did I made wrong ?
[17:38:25] <Brombomb> missplelled data-role
[17:38:28] <Brombomb> on the ul
[17:38:34] <Brombomb> missed the 'a'
[17:38:52] <Underflow> Oh fuck...
[17:39:45] <Underflow> Thanks a lot, sorry for asking a so stupid thing...
[17:40:00] <Brombomb> that fix it?
[17:40:59] <Underflow> yes
[17:41:30] <cgsawtell> Heya, I've been struggling with this for a while, offset() doesn't seem to take into account of images and their size, does anyone know of a work around
[17:43:45] <newcode_> Brombomb:  sorry to bother again.. if i need to decrease the total value when removing a row should i use .click() and then total -= !isNaN(t) ? t : 0; ?
[17:44:36] <codacoder> hello, world?
[17:44:46] <Brombomb> you can either make total a global var, or reread the total out of the input and then decrement that
[17:45:26] <codacoder> any one know if it possible (or even legal) to removeAtrr on a data-* attr?
[17:46:38] <codacoder> anyone?
[17:46:51] <Brombomb> ?removeData
[17:46:52] <bot-t> .removeData([name]): Remove a previously-stored piece of data. http://api.jquery.com/removeData/
[17:47:02] <Brombomb> codacoder:
[17:47:21] <newcode_> ok
[17:47:52] <Brombomb> looks like removeAttr will work fine
[17:47:59] <codacoder> thanks, but I'm not storing data
[17:48:35] <codacoder> this is not .data (which as we proved here couple days ago, is subtly different in this regard)
[17:49:02] <Brombomb> Removing data from jQuery's internal¬†.data()¬†cache does not effect any HTML5¬†data-¬†attributes in a document; use¬†.removeAttr()¬†to remove those.
[17:49:17] <codacoder> question is applied to, for example, <div data-x="fred">
[17:49:27] <codacoder> exactly...
[17:49:39] <codacoder> except it appears to not work here...
[17:50:12] <codacoder> just watched it in firebug - attr remains intact
[17:50:22] <Brombomb> what browser?
[17:50:27] <codacoder> ff 19
[17:51:10] <Brombomb> .removeAttr('data-x') ?
[17:51:16] <codacoder> yep
[17:51:23] <Brombomb> worked in Chrome
[17:51:24] <Brombomb> http://jsfiddle.net/
[17:51:32] <Brombomb> my bad
[17:51:33] <Brombomb> http://jsfiddle.net/brombomb/hCfhs/
[17:54:38] <Brombomb> looks good in FF to me
[17:55:07] <codacoder> yep - here too.  Only diff now is I'm adding it programmatically
[17:55:29] <codacoder> I mean, firebug couldn't be clearer
[17:56:11] <Brombomb> how are you adding it?
[17:56:14] <codacoder> here's the actual code (but keep in mind, the two lines are a million miles apart)
[17:56:22] <codacoder> $th.attr("data-we-gv-header-name", dbId);
[17:56:33] <codacoder> $(th).removeAttr("data-we-gv-header-name");
[17:56:36] <Quest> why it doesnt seems to be working. no data is returned by ajax call. http://pastebin.ca/2346615 any idea?
[17:57:32] <codacoder> but as I said, watching the code in fb, I'm definitely hitting it and it reamins intact after the removeAttr call
[17:57:57] <sahbeewah> codacoder, removeAttr removes the attribute from the element, it doesn't remove the data associated with that element inside jquery
[17:58:11] <codacoder> that's exactly what i want
[17:58:28] <sahbeewah> if you ever read a data-* element using .data(), jquery adds that data into its internal data table
[17:58:40] <sahbeewah> so if you remove the attribute from the element, the internal data is still there
[17:58:44] <Brombomb> Quest: what kind of data are you expecting?  Text, HTML, or JSON?
[17:58:44] <codacoder> not using .data
[17:59:19] <sahbeewah> .data() does two things: it checks to see if there's any internal data associated with that element, if there isn't, it checks if there is a data-* element with that name
[17:59:27] <codacoder> forget .data
[17:59:28] <Quest> Brombomb,  the servlet just printsout text
[17:59:31] <codacoder> not using .data
[18:00:18] <sahbeewah> then .removeAttr removes any attribute on the element created by .attr
[18:00:23] <codacoder> I'm using the (commonly referred to as) HTML5 data-* attr
[18:00:32] <Quest> Brombomb,  well its html.
[18:00:38] <Brombomb> Quest: try adding a dataType: "text" to your ajax call as a property
[18:00:44] <Brombomb> or "html"
[18:00:50] <Quest> k
[18:01:24] <Brombomb> but then make sure the response header of the request is "text/plain" or "application/html" "text/html"  though .ajax is supposed to "guess"
[18:01:36] <Brombomb> you can view the repsonse headers using firebug
[18:02:04] <Quest> Brombomb,  hm
[18:02:14] <Brombomb> codacoder: my attr().removeAttr() worked like a charm.  Can you put up some sample code on jsfiddle?
[18:02:31] <Brombomb> are you sure something else isn't readding it after you remove it?
[18:02:57] <codacoder> Brom: I dont know how to use it
[18:03:05] <Brombomb> jsfillde?
[18:03:07] <codacoder> here's the remove loop:
[18:03:09] <Quest> Brombomb,  how to start firebug in firefox?
[18:03:13] * Quest is new
[18:03:17] <codacoder> THs.each(function(thix, th) { debugger;               $(th).removeAttr("data-we-gv-header-name");             });
[18:03:22] <Brombomb> click the "bug" icon or hit F12 (windows keyboard)
[18:04:52] <Quest> Brombomb,  downloading
[18:05:27] <Brombomb> firfox includes a console with this information as well, but firebug is THE BEST tool out there
[18:05:45] <codacoder> Brom: except when it isn't
[18:05:47] <codacoder> ;)
[18:06:18] <Brombomb> I'd need to see your code codacoder...  Just can't quite get a feel for whats going wrong
[18:06:26] <codacoder> no, nor me
[18:06:31] <Brombomb> removeAttr should work
[18:06:36] <codacoder> cant deny your cutdown version works
[18:06:45] <codacoder> this aint simple to break up
[18:06:57] <Brombomb> can you share the site with me?  pm if you want
[18:06:59] <codacoder> I kow it should - quite alarmed to see this
[18:07:19] <codacoder> wondering if it's a fb bug
[18:07:22] <Quest> Brombomb,  how to view the repsonse headers using firebug
[18:08:01] <Brombomb> I checked in FF codacoder and it worked there too
[18:08:07] <codacoder> ffs
[18:08:14] <Brombomb> Quest: you have firebug open?
[18:08:17] <codacoder> thanks man...
[18:08:31] <codacoder> I'll see if I can rattle it out some other kinda way
[18:08:35] <Brombomb> I'll help you more fi I can, but I need more code
[18:09:10] <codacoder> annoying thisg is, I'm trying to undo the effects of a 3rd party plugin over which I have no control
[18:09:19] <Brombomb> yay!
[18:09:21] <Quest> Brombomb, yes
[18:09:29] <Brombomb> Quest: click the console tab
[18:09:45] <Brombomb> if it says disabled click the enable link then refresh the page
[18:10:04] <Quest> Brombomb, ReferenceError: sent is not defined
[18:10:40] <Brombomb> your function is called send not sent
[18:10:44] <Quest> ooooh..
[18:11:17] <Brombomb> now when it makes the request you should see some bold text with the address it's calling
[18:11:24] <Brombomb> if you click on that it will expand
[18:12:05] <Brombomb> here you can see all the headers that were sent with the request, and the full response
[18:12:09] <Brombomb> and more
[18:12:39] <Brombomb> but it sounds like you had a javascript error.  Firebig will show you where these errors are and try to help point them out
[18:12:57] <Quest> thanks!
[18:13:08] <Brombomb> let me know if you get stuck
[18:14:02] <Quest> its working now!
[18:14:33] <Quest> Brombomb,  i assume it was you to whom I talked about two ajax methods some time ago?
[18:14:57] <Brombomb> yup
[18:17:18] <Quest> Brombomb,  then thx again :)
[18:18:13] <codacoder> Brom... it DOES work... but it's retained in jQs .data
[18:18:38] <codacoder> so, jQ does the "nice" thing, copying data attrs for us...
[18:18:54] <codacoder> but when they're removed via removeAtrr, they remain in .data
[18:19:05] <codacoder> which is... er, wrong
[18:19:28] <Brombomb> thats what shebeewah said earlier
[18:19:36] <Brombomb> do a removeData and removeAttr
[18:19:55] <codacoder> my point was that I was not using .data
[18:20:02] <codacoder> and I still say I'm not
[18:20:44] <b-lew> anyone in here helpin out?
[18:21:02] <codacoder> I thought it was "write less"?
[18:21:04] <Brombomb> jquery copies it to there for those of us who do and want a shortcut method
[18:21:17] <Brombomb> in which case it alows me to write much less
[18:21:23] <codacoder> but it's waiting to bite you if it aint cleaned up
[18:21:32] <codacoder> I'd call that a partial
[18:21:46] <Brombomb> I've never had to clean up my data
[18:21:50] <Brombomb> whats up b-lew
[18:21:53] <codacoder> me neither
[18:22:33] <b-lew> I have a weird js issue. kind of confusing too. mind if I link?
[18:22:39] <Brombomb> sure
[18:23:27] <Quest> Brombomb,  with this script my browser keeps showing the loading circle at the tab of firefox. (after the ajax call is completed and the text is shown) why is that?
[18:23:31] <b-lew> http://bvh.delineamultimedia.com/?page_id=2¬†-> if you click the first image there is a gallery. There is a gallery. Which is correct. When you close it something happens (i don't know what) but then re-open it again and it's a static image. I'm just running a function.
[18:23:31] <b-lew> http://pastie.org/7236203¬†-> i left some white space around where i'm working on line 46
[18:23:31] <b-lew> its just running that function each time. no reason for that to be any different on 2nd load. I'm a bit in over my head with this issue.
[18:24:53] <Brombomb> Quest: go to the Net Tab
[18:25:09] <Brombomb> enable and reload.... You can see whats holding it open
[18:26:54] <Quest> Brombomb,  nothing shows up in net
[18:28:23] <Quest> strange
[18:28:27] <Brombomb> you enabled it and reloaded?
[18:28:33] <Quest> yes
[18:28:43] <Brombomb> b-lew I'm having network issues so I'll look once it loads
[18:29:08] <Brombomb> Quest: you should get a neat little timeline of all images/html/scripts/ etc... loading
[18:29:45] <Quest> Brombomb,  it shows status on ajax.html load. but all goes blank when I click the "click me" ajax call
[18:30:01] <Quest> then the new page loads with ajax results
[18:30:08] <Quest> as document.write (result)
[18:30:25] <Quest> success: function (result) { document.write(result); }
[18:30:36] <b-lew> Thanks! @Brombomb
[18:31:14] <Quest> doesnt happens in chrome
[18:31:28] <codacoder> Brom... thanks man.  At least this is making some kinda sense now. Appreciate your patience
[18:31:35] <Brombomb> chrome has tools as well by hitting F12
[18:32:35] <Brombomb> np codacoder
[18:33:44] <Brombomb> Hey b-lew ever see VisualEvent 2?
[18:33:56] <b-lew> @Brombomb no I haven't
[18:34:15] <Brombomb> http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual%2BEvent%2B2
[18:34:16] <b-lew> will google
[18:34:29] <Quest> Brombomb,  i mean the loading circle is not visible in chrome
[18:34:56] <Brombomb> then nothing is loading ;)
[18:36:19] <Quest> why in firefox then?
[18:36:21] <b-lew> will add that to my bookmarks
[18:36:36] <Brombomb> Im having some crazy network issues
[18:39:05] <b-lew> no worries @Brombomb
[18:39:07] <astroman> </div> haaaaaaaaaaaa :( jquery is to bad with em
[18:39:38] <BrandonC> hey all, can i ask questions about http://bxslider.com
[18:39:46] <Brombomb> b-lew your paste is cutting off the right side
[18:40:00] <Brombomb> jk... thats what scroll bars are for
[18:40:30] <b-lew> heh
[18:40:53] <b-lew> whats up @BrandonC
[18:41:10] <BrandonC> if you look at http://findorganics.me/ thru chrome
[18:41:15] <Brombomb> thats kind of sexy
[18:41:28] <b-lew> Find Organics coming soon...
[18:41:30] <BrandonC> when you zoom out 2 or more the slider's animation makes the css change by 1px around
[18:41:31] <BrandonC> oh
[18:41:42] <BrandonC> try agian
[18:42:03] <BrandonC> chrome, zoom out some and watch slider, when animates header stuff and right side stuff moves 1px
[18:42:17] <BrandonC> i do use Prestashop.com
[18:42:36] <BrandonC> but i figure its in the jquery
[18:43:01] <BrandonC> i did notice in the dev tools of chrome, there are web-kit styles, wondering if that has something to do with it
[18:43:22] <BrandonC> they are not in my css files and i googled web kits, and seems there are browsers that are 'web kits' like chrome
[18:43:26] <BrandonC> thats as far as i got
[18:43:43] <BrandonC> other thought is its an em vs px thing with the zoom
[18:46:10] <Brombomb> I don't know what youre looking at BrandonC
[18:46:37] <b-lew> @bromb
[18:46:39] <Brombomb> b-lew I'm not seeing anything pop out at my other than the clonging
[18:47:01] <b-lew> @Brombomb you have to zoom out 2 x for @BrandonC
[18:47:15] <b-lew> its a weird issue been trying to fix it for 2 weeks
[18:47:17] <b-lew> :-/
[18:48:47] <BrandonC> Brombomb, b-lew, you can zoom in or out, only iin chrome i see it happen
[18:49:26] <BrandonC> and apperently if you zoom all the way out it breaks the slider
[18:49:53] <b-lew> Do a lot of people zoom on websites?
[18:50:43] <BrandonC> i wouldnt mind so much but its on just a few zoomes
[18:51:11] <b-lew> I see what you are saying. I think it maybe a css issue?
[18:52:13] <b-lew> have you done *{zoom:1;}
[18:53:06] <BrandonC> whats that?
[18:54:01] <b-lew> the same problem isn't occurring on this website‚Ä¶ http://bxslider.com/ which is why I'm thinking its a css thing
[18:54:19] <BrandonC> ya i noticed that too
[18:54:35] <BrandonC> but the slider has to be doing that to the css right? its only when it animates
[18:54:55] <b-lew> did the plugin come with css?
[18:55:25] <BrandonC> ya
[18:55:56] <b-lew> .bx-wrapper¬†has a *zoom:¬†1; on it
[18:56:07] <BrandonC> what does that do ?
[18:56:28] <Brombomb> its an IE fix
[18:56:45] <Brombomb> the * in front of zoom is an IE only css perfix
[18:56:52] <Brombomb> IE7 and below
[18:56:54] <BrandonC> is that why i dont see it in the dev tools for chrome?
[18:57:00] <BrandonC> what does zoom do?
[18:57:17] <Brombomb> its usally a fix for display: inline-box;
[18:57:24] <Brombomb> not sure what zoom actually does
[18:57:49] <Brombomb> http://jsfiddle.net/W24de/
[18:57:50] <Brombomb> lol
[18:57:50] <BrandonC> Zoom is supported in IE, Safari 4, Chrome (and you can get a somewhat similar effect in Firefox with -moz-transform: scale(x) since 3.5).
[18:57:52] <Quest> Brombomb,  well I am close . but this script is not working... http://pastebin.ca/2346652
[18:57:53] <BrandonC> what i found so far
[18:58:00] <b-lew> zoom works in chrome as well.
[18:58:21] <Brombomb> yes but the *zoom is IE only
[18:58:24] <Brombomb> it's an ie hack
[18:58:29] <BrandonC> cause of the *
[18:58:33] <BrandonC> right?
[18:58:35] <Brombomb> yes
[18:58:45] <xavi> hello
[18:58:57] <xavi> is dom order supposed to be preserved after calling prevail?
[18:59:04] <xavi> oops prevAll*
[18:59:48] <vladikoff> xavi, http://api.jquery.com/prevAll/#prevAll-selector
[19:03:13] <xavi> I see, so if the jquery object is greater than size 1, no order is defined?
[19:03:33] <b-lew> Hummm I don't know
[19:03:35] <Quest> Brombomb,  any clues?
[19:04:07] <b-lew> Sorry I need to fix my issue. its been 2 weeks and I still have no clue.
[19:04:21] <Brombomb> whats going wrong Quest
[19:05:25] <Quest> Brombomb,  the function runs. but no ajax is made. no concole errors either
[19:05:42] <scar> how can i set specific delays for hoverintent in and out?
[19:06:05] <Brombomb> i think you need to move the ajax call into the submit function
[19:06:10] <BrandonC> so think i should use the css that comes with it, or not?
[19:06:12] <Brombomb> and then properly close the submit function
[19:06:26] <Quest> Brombomb,  either this line  var text = document.getElementById("ta").value;           or this line       url: "AjaxServlet?param="+text,     is causing a problem I think
[19:07:27] <Brombomb> move lines 13 - 32 to line 8
[19:07:34] <Brombomb> change line 10 to }
[19:07:47] <Quest> oh
[19:07:50] <Brombomb> oh line 12 needs to move up with ther others as well
[19:08:05] <Brombomb> or just remove line 10
[19:08:08] <Brombomb> really
[19:08:24] <Brombomb> and 33 I think
[19:14:18] <Quest> Brombomb, sorry for silly mistake. but still now working now http://pastebin.ca/2346661
[19:18:47] <Quest> Brombomb,  any clue?
[19:20:22] <Brombomb> http://pastebin.ca/2346665
[19:20:35] <Brombomb> I rewrote your code to be jquery-ified
[19:22:12] <Quest> Brombomb,  some errors are now coming
[19:22:14] <Quest> wait
[19:22:36] <Brombomb> I'm moving it to a fiddle to see whats up
[19:23:00] <Quest> k
[19:26:57] <Quest> Brombomb,  http://pastebin.ca/2346669
[19:27:44] <Brombomb> whats the issue?
[19:28:16] <Quest> Brombomb,  its not saying "boo" as an alert
[19:28:27] <Quest> Brombomb,  it should as the ajax was completed
[19:29:10] <Brombomb> click the response tab
[19:29:14] <Brombomb> whats does it say there?
[19:29:15] <Quest> Brombomb,  the code in had no response
[19:29:25] <Brombomb> looks like it should be working
[19:31:05] <Quest> Brombomb,  wait. does the ajax run from the same server/ same directory?
[19:31:22] <Quest> Brombomb,  can I ajax anything from anywhere?
[19:31:27] <Brombomb> whatever url you tell it to
[19:31:38] <Brombomb> javascript has a same origin policy
[19:31:56] <Brombomb> meaning unless you do some "special" thing you can't really request outside sites
[19:32:03] <Brombomb> like google.com can't call out to bing.com
[19:32:14] <Brombomb> but ya you can call anything on your domain
[19:32:26] <Quest> iam on local host
[19:33:19] <Brombomb> ya so you can call anything on localhost
[19:33:43] <Quest> that was the problem
[19:34:04] <Quest> found it. this time i was giving full path   url: "http://localhost:8084/ohub/AjaxServlet?param=home",
[19:34:16] <Quest> and the .html was somewhere on my hardisk
[19:34:38] <Quest> now its  url: "AjaxServlet?param=home", and .html is in the same folder. so working
[19:37:39] <Brombomb> cool
[19:37:52] <Quest> great. I just tested it. its working smooth
[19:38:04] <Quest> Brombomb,  your fantastic.
[19:38:28] <Brombomb> thanks
[19:38:32] <Brombomb> glad i could help
[19:42:08] <Quest> Brombomb,  I have taken too much of your time. before going.  I would share what I want to do. I am creating a forum + live chat webpage. user types text in text area, it goes to server, checks up, validates, enters text to database, gets back to page, enters the text to webpage by creating a new <tr> element.           after every five seconds the web page sends an ajax call and dowloads any comments sent by other users  as well (from the database table s
[19:42:09] <Quest> ees if any new comments have added)
[19:43:14] <Brombomb> cool.  Bet of Luck!
[20:46:08] <devslash> this is my site: http://iosdevs.org/devslash/MyMusicStreamer/ I am trying to simulate a mouse hover event of the first item in the file tree by doing $('#jqueryFileTree').eq(0).trigger("mouseenter");
[20:46:31] <devslash> but that doesn't do anything. same with hover()
[20:47:55] <Iarfen> Hi!
[20:49:47] <Iarfen> I want to fire the onchange event of a select after changing its value. Here's the code: http://pastebin.com/BkjJ4ZYh
[20:50:15] <Iarfen> the problem is that it doesn't work the first time, only when you do multiple change, I don't know why, it's a very rare error
[20:50:41] <Iarfen> the $option variable is 1 for the first  element, 2 for the second, etc.. It starts with 1, not 0, that's why I use $option -1 on the code
[20:52:03] <astroman> help
[20:52:23] <astroman> when i use treeview i can't put another function in the node of the tree
[20:54:13] <bsdbofh> Hey all, question about a tiny little line of query.. am I missing something here?
[20:54:14] <bsdbofh> http://jsfiddle.net/69Bw8/
[20:54:22] <bsdbofh> with the mouseup(function()
[20:54:31] <bsdbofh> it's just not registering the click
[20:56:30] <vladikoff> bsdbofh, http://jsfiddle.net/69Bw8/2/
[20:57:31] <bsdbofh> vladikoff, thanks.
[21:08:07] <overbrain> hey
[21:08:48] <overbrain> has anyone used AngularJS?
[21:09:54] <overbrain> $ = null
[21:12:42] <raj> can jqui's .button() be run on a regular button element? or only on checkboxes?
[21:16:39] <bsdbofh> okay, so I now know that the click registers. now i'm trying to do a POST to a php page via the jquery http://jsfiddle.net/69Bw8/6/
[21:17:27] <bsdbofh> but it's taking the url # from the li, and the POST function isn't getting triggered.
[21:17:27] <bsdbofh> hmm
[21:35:28] <shoky> raj: sure, buttons work
[21:36:34] <doug> what's the Very Best Grid Plugin?
[21:38:51] <bsdbofh> well, I've rewritten it according to how I think it should work, but this POST still just doesn't go through. http://jsfiddle.net/69Bw8/7/
[21:38:52] <anirvana> I need help. so I am jquery ui autocomplete with a remote data source. It works perfectly fine when I run the site locally but autocomplete doesn't work at all on the remote site. I have verified that my data source is returning the data perfectly
[21:39:01] <anirvana> Any pointers on what might be going wrong
[21:39:47] <anirvana> when I use an array as data source, it works
[21:40:36] <spaceone> hi
[21:40:42] <shoky> bsdbofh: what's  function loadBoard(&$board)
[21:40:46] <shoky> &$board ?
[21:41:05] <bsdbofh> I'm trying to pass the value of the li's id
[21:41:06] <anirvana> here is my code: http://pastebin.com/LrD31Gai
[21:41:06] <spaceone> how can i see the request headers that were send by the browser on an jquery-ajax request?
[21:41:08] <bsdbofh> over to the function
[21:41:11] <shoky> bsdbofh: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token &
[21:41:58] <bsdbofh> hmm, I thought it was &$var to pass a var to a function
[21:42:09] <shoky> who told you that
[21:42:41] <bsdbofh> no one, I thought I remembered.. oh wait, maybe I was mixing php in there
[21:42:43] <bsdbofh> ugh
[21:42:44] <shoky> bsdbofh: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/69Bw8/8/  should work
[21:43:34] <bsdbofh> cool, trying that now
[21:43:55] <bsdbofh> hmm, still not loading
[21:44:03] <bsdbofh> it's taking the # from the li's href
[21:44:09] <raj> shoky, cool, so it'll retain a state or whatever we talked about?
[21:44:10] <bsdbofh> and trying to load that
[21:44:45] <spaceone> how can i see the request headers that were send by the browser on an jquery-ajax request?
[21:53:18] <shoky> raj: a regular button doesn't have state
[21:53:44] <raj> butt if I do $('button').button(), it now has state? So can make it look permanently clicked
[21:54:22] <shoky> you can make it look permanently clicked with css,
[21:54:35] <shoky> that's not the kind of "real" state i'm talking about
[21:54:44] <raj> oh
[21:55:03] <raj> I wasn't able to get the gradient thing looking right
[21:55:06] <raj> not sure why
[21:55:15] <shoky> if you do $(':checkbox').button()  then it'll have state
[21:55:19] <raj> it changed other parts of the button
[21:55:25] <raj> oh
[21:55:51] <shoky> checkbox has on/off state. button is stateless.  .button() makes the checkbox look like a button
[21:57:02] <raj> gotcha, so button() doesn't solve my issue if I insist on using a <button> element
[21:57:37] <shoky> well, it could i guess, with a css "hack" to make it look pressed even though the underlying button isn't really pressed
[21:58:36] <shoky> i mean, just cause it gives you easy css control of the button and already has unpressed/pressed css for you to use
[21:59:10] <raj> aah, I see
[21:59:12] <raj> good point
[22:04:33] <aZnmAn> anyone here familiar with adding custom validation rules for the jquery validation plugin?
[22:06:55] <aZnmAn> The validation message won't disappear for my "country" rule... even if the value is correct...
[22:07:39] <bsdbofh> shoky, is there a way to make it link to the query POST instead of loading the # from the li's href?
[22:07:54] <aZnmAn> http://pastebin.com/rcYpxGa0 Any help much appreciated
[22:08:09] <anirvana> Repeat: I need help. so I am jquery ui autocomplete with a remote data source. It works perfectly fine when I run the site locally but autocomplete doesn't work at all on the remote site. I have verified that my data source is returning the data perfectly.Any pointers on what might be going wrong. here is my code: http://pastebin.com/LrD31Gai
[22:09:43] <shoky> bsdbofh: donno what you mean
[22:10:27] <bsdbofh> shoky, when I click on the li item, it links to #
[22:11:10] <bsdbofh> <li class="boardSelect" id="arch"><a href="#">Arch Team</a></li>
[22:11:30] <bsdbofh> so when that gets clicked, in the browser url bar, I see the added #
[22:11:52] <bsdbofh> and the query function doesn't load the php file that's in the POST function
[22:14:16] <shoky> bsdbofh you can preventDefault() on the event argument , if you change the event to a click:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/69Bw8/10/
[22:14:55] <shoky> so it won't add the #
[22:16:11] <shoky> bsdbofh: the ajax request won't do anything visible unless you make it happen yourself in the success callback of $.ajax
[22:16:23] <bsdbofh> oh.
[22:16:39] <bsdbofh> so, I need to use the success callback to actually load the page?
[22:16:39] <shoky> maybe you just want a redirect?
[22:16:54] <bsdbofh> well, basically, i'm trying to use this to reload the page, with a new board.
[22:17:10] <shoky> reload the page? or change the page contents?
[22:17:19] <bsdbofh> and board.php looks for a POST var when it loads, to know what to do
[22:17:27] <bsdbofh> both, I guess.
[22:17:41] <shoky> why ajax then?
[22:17:44] <shoky> why not make regular links
[22:18:02] <bsdbofh> I dunno
[22:18:04] <bsdbofh> no reason
[22:18:07] <shoky> <li><a href="board.php?board=arch">Arch Team</a></li>
[22:18:33] <shoky> no javascript required
[22:19:42] <shoky> anyway yeah, with ajax you have to do whatever you want in the success callback,
[22:20:06] <shoky> and the success callback will get called with an argument that has the response data
[22:20:35] <bsdbofh> shoky, ah okay. gotcha. well, you make a good point about just using a regular link.
[22:20:48] <bsdbofh> That does cut down on the complexity
[22:41:29] <b4284> hi there, i'm having problems with smooth scrolling with hashes
