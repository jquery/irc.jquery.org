[00:00:07] * puppen <3s css
[00:00:28] <yamahaalex> ok
[00:00:34] <yamahaalex> im using joomla, but editing the css
[00:00:46] <yamahaalex> i just want the login button to look cool like the jquery mobile button
[00:01:14] <puppen> yamahaalex: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=css+button+styling
[00:01:49] <puppen> you could grab jquery mobile and just find the bits related to the buttons.. yank it out..
[00:01:51] <yamahaalex> yeah but im wondering if i can just link an online (google) css file
[00:01:58] <yamahaalex> and then apply that class
[00:03:01] <puppen> Well, getting the whole css file, just for one button.. it's a waste of bits/bytes
[00:03:27] <yamahaalex> ok
[00:03:34] <yamahaalex> your right, i dont knwo why i didnt just search for a simple css style
[00:03:46] <yamahaalex> i saw jquery mobile and wanted to try it, but what you say will do the same thing
[00:07:44] <puppen> awesome.. If you're going with the css approach and need any help with it #css is the place to ask :).. There's loads of good tutorials out there though.
[00:26:45] <nVee> morning guys. I have a custom cursor, in the shape of a pencil, but the "point" of the pencil does not work on the actual hit area. Is there a way to move the cursor's hit state or area so that the "point" of the pencil would effectively be the place where it's clickable? I am assuming this will be done with javascript or hopefully jquery?
[00:37:28] <marekw2143> hi, does getting $(obj).attr('onclick') trigger onclick event ? \
[00:46:28] <manixor> I'm testing a slide show picture using cycle jQuery tool. I want to take the picture dynamically from directory. My progress is this: http://dpaste.com/645938/ , it's a good way?  I'm wander if this way is not slow? It's possible to do it with ajax? On my example it's load the pic every iteration?
[00:56:20] <razamatan> how do i write a selector that selects the body but not a particular element?
[01:10:52] <Woet> razamatan: $("body") ?
[01:14:47] <lolgolflol> Hi , Everybody.
[01:15:03] <lolgolflol> I have question about jquery
[01:16:03] <coldhead> please, tell us more
[01:17:07] <sasori> :S , any resources,samples,tuts, how to change the look and feel of a jquery dialog box ?
[01:17:16] <lolgolflol> sorry , I am not good english skill, I am creating sentent.
[01:18:58] <lolgolflol> when you write own plunin , in code like  (function(){}),();
[01:19:24] <lolgolflol> () is mean ?
[01:19:54] <lolgolflol> Do you understand me?
[01:20:55] <nail_> lolgolflol: that means you create an anonymous function and call it immediately (if you leave out the ',' which is a syntax error)
[01:21:58] <waf> good morning! (CET)
[01:22:24] <waf> I want to document my code, and I really like the jquery api documentation.
[01:22:28] <waf> how is this generated?
[01:22:36] <lolgolflol> <nail_> thank you.
[01:22:39] <waf> is it done by hand, or are there some magicks involved?
[01:28:45] <lolgolflol> in java , have tool script generate document but jquery I dunno sorry
[01:29:01] <lolgolflol> i am newbie.
[01:29:19] <waf> lolgolflol: so am i :)
[01:29:31] <juha_> java != javascript
[01:29:37] <waf> i can document all other languages, but i@ve yet to find a decent solution for javascript.
[01:29:55] <lolgolflol> yes
[01:30:10] <waf> juha_: any ideas?
[01:30:25] <waf> an ECMAscript plugin for Doxygen? :P
[01:31:31] <lolgolflol> (function(){}) , and $(function(){})  Is it same ?
[01:32:01] <lolgolflol> I saw (function(){}) in plugin.
[01:33:06] <ablomen> lolgolflol, $(function(){}) << is short for $(document).ready(function ( ) { });  -  (function ( ) { }()) just executes a function declaration right away
[01:34:22] <ablomen> (ehm function expression))
[01:36:58] <lolgolflol> thank you , I read sentent slow ,but not good english skill
[02:15:53] <MACscr> so im trying to use a jquery plugin with a wordpress site and it says its jquery.noconflict compatible, but im not 100% sure how to use the no conflict part or if thats causing the problem. Right now the plugin doesnt think jquery is defined, yet it is and it works if i try an alert. Though in the test case, im using Jquery instead of $. Any suggestions?
[02:16:50] <MACscr> im tried replacing all $ with jQuery in the plugin, but no difference
[02:20:52] <xec> MACscr: is the plugin included before jquery?
[02:21:37] <xec> also, how exactly did you test jquery with an alert?
[02:23:02] <MACscr> xec: after
[02:23:07] <MACscr> let me pastebin the test
[02:23:21] <xec> good
[02:23:31] <MACscr> jQuery(document).ready(function(){	alert('test'); });
[02:23:35] <MACscr> actually its pretty simple
[02:23:39] <MACscr> so figured thats fine
[02:24:07] <xec> sure
[02:24:16] <xec> is the site live somewhere?
[02:24:45] <MACscr> http://www.bearmuchfruit.org/
[02:26:51] <xec> MACscr: jcarousellite is included at the top of the page, before anything else
[02:27:09] <xec> MACscr: move it down after jquery, you should be fine
[02:27:58] <felix_321> he folks! having a simple IE bug/problem here with .show(), see code here: http://jsfiddle.net/xLt6j/ just dont know, why my div is not showing up when calling show()
[02:28:30] <MACscr> xec: lol, what a dumb mistake. thanks!
[02:28:32] <felix_321> anyone would be so kind to have a quick look on that? I would be happy about your help. thanks!
[02:28:42] <xec> MACscr: np :)
[02:39:12] <Merbster> I ham doing some prefilling of textarea with "Type here text" that should disappear when the user clicks the textarea.
[02:39:26] <Merbster> The textarea might be filled with some actual data and then the prefill text should not fill it out.
[02:40:21] <Merbster> I do this by comparing the textarea text. But when comparing it the textareas value is "the old value" not the new one that was inserted.
[02:40:54] <xec> ?demo @ Merbster
[02:40:54] <bot-t> Merbster, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:44:36] <marekw2143> do parameters passed as get  parameters to the www page are considered as part of the URL?
[02:44:57] <xec> felix_321: any reason you are using async: false ?
[02:46:06] <xec> marekw2143: yes, depending on how you define URL ;D
[02:47:54] <xec> marekw2143: what i mean is, URL is just the location while URI is the whole address, iirc
[02:49:57] <felix_321> yes, because i want to disable the interface while ajax is operating, its a ajax based configurator where you can put together different articles, which get transfered to the shopping cart via ajax and there are many dependencies between the articles, so only one operation at a time is possible
[02:50:10] <MACscr> ok, so I know how to fade in and out an image. is there a way to statically fade out the side of an image? lets say i only want 50% of it to fully show, etc?
[02:51:30] <xec> MACscr: not that i know of, maybe with some fancy SVG filter or you could overlay a transparent image
[02:53:01] <Merbster> not worth reproducing I was just using a cached value instead of the live one.
[02:53:04] <xec> like, you could have a png with a gradient from transparent to opaque placed on top
[02:53:11] <felix_321> xec: you can test it here: http://dev.kmlt.de/index.php/schablonen-konfigurator.html
[02:53:41] <xec> MACscr: or a css3 gradient
[02:53:47] <felix_321> xec: works fine it firefox, a loader image appears while ajaxing, but none appears in IE
[02:54:01] <lolgolflol> I saw fade in and out , I have question. when I have two selector and I would like to fade out together and then callback but callback two time. How i do ?
[02:54:37] <xec> felix_321: what version of ie?
[02:54:53] <xec> felix_321: ie8 appears to overlay the whole page with a white box while loading
[02:56:10] <felix_321> xec: really? im using IE9 and the big overlay you describe is not happening when i switch the IE9 to IE8 mode
[02:56:36] <felix_321> xec: oh its a mess as always with the IE
[02:58:43] <xec> felix_321: yeah =( - and i dont have access to ie9, but my guess would be that the script is firing (try a console.log)  but ie9 is not rendering the html/css properly
[03:02:17] <felix_321> xec: what do you mean by "firing", you mean it logging into the console? no its not, i disabled all logs..
[03:02:59] <xec> felix_321: i mean i think the event is probably fine, and you can check by logging
[03:03:23] <xec> firing = executes
[03:14:58] <jamov> anyone tried out: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/scale9grid or know of a better way to do it?
[03:30:19] <puppen> spppplliiiiittttt!
[03:56:03] <fabs> hi, is someone use anythingslider ?
[03:56:36] <fabs> i've think i've found a bug, i want to confirm
[03:56:36] <minna1> fabs: flexslider is better.
[04:07:55] <Famic> hi
[04:08:15] <johnline3> JKWERRY
[04:08:41] <Famic> any chance some people in here can help on jquerymobile ? #jquerymobile is a zombie channel
[04:09:08] <Famic> I am looking for a way to have a fixed header working with nested lists
[04:11:12] <ravenzz> fixed widths on mobile devices is not a smart idea imo
[04:11:34] <Famic> I meant fixed as in position fixed
[04:11:44] <ravenzz> oh
[04:11:50] <ravenzz> can you provide a demo?
[04:12:02] <Famic> http://demo.lindicible.com/sg/
[04:13:01] <Famic> basically I'd like to always keep header and footer in place
[04:14:20] <ravenzz> I can't see any nested list there
[04:15:34] <Famic> maybe if you look at source code you will
[04:16:16] <ravenzz> are you talking about the navbar?
[04:16:34] <Famic> no, I'm talking about "about us, services, etc
[04:16:50] <Gorkyman> hmm... how can I fire 2 function when radio button is selected/unselected ?
[04:17:17] <Famic> navbar is within the header I would like to have present at all times
[04:18:36] <ravenzz> as the footer do?
[04:19:57] <Famic> hm... I don't see the footer staying in place, but I'd like both to
[04:20:31] <Famic> maybe on some devices it does, though... I believe it should stay in place according to the docs and markup
[04:24:10] <ravenzz> Famic what about .ui-header { position:fixed; top:0; left:0; z-index:999 } .ui-content { margin: 102px auto; }
[04:24:11] <ravenzz> ?
[04:26:01] <Famic> ravenzz; that doesn't seem to help
[04:26:39] <Famic> I'm most likely looking for a solution relative to jquerymobile itself more than css
[04:27:04] <ravenzz> you said that you want the header to be fixed ?
[04:27:07] <ravenzz> that is fixed
[04:27:22] <Famic> I want it to show
[04:27:34] <Famic> right now it gets hidden when I go into a list
[04:28:21] <ravenzz> did you apply these properties on your css?
[04:28:48] <ravenzz> why you would position elements with js when you can use plain css
[04:29:22] <Famic> I'm not sure you realized I am using jQueryMobile here
[04:29:59] <ravenzz> yes I do
[04:30:01] <Famic> which means many things get altered and specific behaviours occur
[04:30:29] <ravenzz> I dunno man
[04:30:54] <ravenzz> ask again, maybe someone else could help you
[04:31:43] <Famic> for instance when I go into a sublist, a new page div is created and previous one is hidden. I'm looking for a way to keep the header/footer from the main page onto the sublist pages
[04:32:07] <ravenzz> oh
[04:32:11] <ravenzz> I see
[04:32:35] <ravenzz> anyway I don't have experice on jQuery mobile, sorry
[04:33:11] <aaronmcadam> Famic: #jquerymobile
[04:33:20] <Famic> in that case I'm afraid you won't be able to help much. This is a very specific beast. Thanks anyway
[04:33:31] <Famic> aaronmcadam: I tried there, it's a zombie chan
[04:33:36] <aaronmcadam> sometimes
[04:33:54] <aaronmcadam> sounds like what you're trying is impossible
[04:33:55] <Famic> sometimes there may be some people trying to ask questions, yeah
[04:34:10] <molavy> how can i simulate return key on input when blur input happen
[04:34:14] <molavy> ?
[04:34:21] <aaronmcadam> what you want is really an area within a root page that changes
[04:34:32] <aaronmcadam> don't think that's possible at the moment
[04:35:08] <aaronmcadam> molavy: you mean trigger a submit of the form?
[04:36:12] <felix_321> he folks! would be great to get some help with a show/hide problem in IE...
[04:36:15] <felix_321> ...i have a div with a img inside and the div should show up when ajaxStart() fires...
[04:36:19] <felix_321> ...works fine in FF, can test it here: http://dev.kmlt.de/index.php/schablonen-konfigurator.html...
[04:36:24] <felix_321> ...the div has a class 'hide', which hides the div (nice!) and on ajaxStart() i do .removeAttr('class') to remove the whole class attribute. in IE the class attriute gets removed, but the div doesnt appear...
[04:36:28] <felix_321> ...can anyone help me out?? thanks so far!
[04:40:28] <Famic> felix_321: try .removeClass('hide') instead
[04:42:00] <molavy> aaronmcadam, no, i want when a user click outside of input, input keypress event with keycode 13 happen
[04:42:26] <aaronmcadam> ah just listen for that then
[04:42:39] <aaronmcadam> keyup and test event.keycode or something similar
[04:42:58] <felix_321> Famic: did that before, doesnt work, so i took removeAttr to make it even more consequent
[04:43:23] <Famic> felix_321: removeAttr is probably not as smart as removeClass
[04:43:46] <molavy> one line code example please
[04:44:26] <felix_321> Famic: might be true, but none of both would work
[04:44:48] <Famic> define "none (...) would work"
[04:45:46] <molavy>  $(".input").live("blur", function(e) {...//what must be here})
[04:46:22] <molavy> i create input on fly so i use live
[04:46:44] <felix_321> removeClass('hide') removes the class, removeAttr() removes the whole class attr, i tried both and they work, means they manipulate the dom correctly, but the div does not appear, doesnt matter which method i use to remove the class!
[04:46:55] <molavy> but how can i return keypress with keycode 13
[04:48:27] <blackspotwiggins> felix_321, the correct deduction from that would be that the div is hidden via other means
[04:48:37] <blackspotwiggins> but take your time getting there :)
[04:49:26] <molavy> no idea?
[04:49:30] <felix_321> black
[04:50:24] <felix_321> blackspot: yes, I'll check this again then. but it works in other browsers though. I'll be back...thank you guys!
[04:50:54] <Famic> felix_321: looks like a script is using the 'hide' class to target it, but inline style is then used. try to .show() it after you altered the class
[04:52:08] <felix_321> Famic: $(this).removeClass('hide').show();
[04:52:11] <felix_321> doesnt work either
[04:52:39] <Famic> felix_321: are you sure $(this) targets the right element ?
[04:54:04] <felix_321> yes, it works in FF. and it manipulates the dom correctly, but the div just doesnt want to show up. you can check it out here: http://dev.kmlt.de/index.php/schablonen-konfigurator.html
[04:55:33] <Famic> felix_321: having valid markup would probablly help
[04:55:52] <felix_321> Famic: what i did: initially, the div has no class, so it shows up and i am sure, that it can appear. then, i add the class 'hide' to it, it disappeary..good! then, i remove the class 'hide', it doesnt appear
[04:56:25] <felix_321> famic: you think its the markup? i can try this, but its a team project. i'll see what i can do about that.
[04:56:32] <Famic> which div is it and how do you hide it ?
[04:57:20] <felix_321> $("div#ajax-loader").ajaxStart(function(){
[04:57:20] <felix_321> 		$(this).removeClass('hide').show();
[04:57:20] <felix_321> 	 });
[04:57:26] <Famic> have invalid markup and all hell breaks loose. You can find days pulling your hairs trying to figure out why that browser acts this way if your markup is bad
[04:58:06] <felix_321> Famic: ok, then i better get people going to tidy that up. see your point, thanks!
[05:00:17] <Onkeltem> Hi
[05:00:40] <Onkeltem> Is there a whay to make two overlapping divs to multiply colors for example?
[05:00:55] <Onkeltem> using jquery or some plugin.
[05:01:14] <Onkeltem> because using CSS - this is not possible afaik
[05:06:21] <guido_w> hi there... can anyone help me with a qunit issue?
[05:06:59] <guido_w> seems like qunit reports errors for tests that do not result in errors, if other tests (all async) result in an exception
[05:07:32] <guido_w> so async tests seem to be executed simultaneously, and exceptions seem to get reported on all tests that are running at the moment the exception occurs
[05:08:09] <guido_w> i was wondering if there is a way around it...
[05:08:37] <jammsen> Hi guys, i got a problem with event coloring http://jsfiddle.net/5bvF2/27/ it switches the color to red but not to 3366cc blue, i tried attr or css, only red not blue :(
[05:08:52] <jammsen> with # and without :(
[05:15:36] <Alan> in jquerymobile, which event do i need to intercept to modify a page before the loading thing goes away and it tries to show the page?
[05:17:36] <blazento> hi how can i see if my images have all been loaded?
[05:18:17] <blazento> im running an animation and it's happening before my images even load... i'd like a loading diologue or something

[05:30:21] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys. I'm cloning a table with some <select>'s in it. Is it possible to have the selected option selected in the cloned content too??
[05:33:59] <getsetbro> Has anyone made jquery UI sortable work with touch events?
[05:37:29] <mistermi> Can someone tell me why this: http://jsfiddle.net/gVJAJ/ dosent animate smoothly. I try to animate the next element half way throw the animation of the previous element.
[05:39:20] <johnline3> i think cause you're doing fadein as well as movement
[05:40:59] <biodegabriel_> mistermi: you're not animating half way, you're animating in a sequence. i can't see anything in your code that says "half-way through, start animating the next element"… know what i mean?
[05:41:23] <biodegabriel> mistermi: http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[05:42:46] <mistermi> johnline3: your right just animating the opacity works fine.
[05:44:50] <johnline3> i think you want something like this: $('.fade1').each(function (i) {var $item = $(this);setTimeout(function() {$item.animate({'opacity': 1,'right': '13px'}, 1000);}, 200*i);});
[05:47:14] <johnline3> http://jsfiddle.net/gVJAJ/3/
[05:47:26] <mistermi> setTimeout … dont try to fix everything just with jquery ;) god bless you

[06:05:11] <Frantic> guys, I'm using colorbox's inline mode, and in my loaded page I include some <script src="/some_script.js">. Colorbox apparently loads it from /some_script.js/_=<random_number> to prevent caching. But in my case I want that caching. I can't seem to find the code that does this or how to turn it off, any ideas?
[06:05:44] <Frantic> that's /some_script.js?_=<random_number>
[06:13:44] <xec> Frantic: does the same thing happen if you create a brand new (blank) javascript file and include that in the same manner?
[06:15:19] <gabriel9> anyone use jquery ui?

[06:27:18] <badoskie> is there any jquery plugin that can convert english date expressions like "Jan2011 - Feb2013" and "Jan2011&April2011" to number of months?
[06:34:19] <sublimenal> Hi there, when running in compatibility mode jQuery()  do all the external scripts need to be converted to this format instead of using the $ ?
[06:34:33] <sublimenal> for instance if im using a plugin

[06:35:49] <sublimenal> Ok thanks
[06:35:55] <xec> what plugin is this?
[06:36:22] <sublimenal> http://roy-jin.appspot.com/jsp/textareaCounter.jsp    word counting plugin
[06:37:51] <xec> sublimenal: yeah, it's fine, it already translates "jQuery" into "$" for internal use

[06:39:27] <terminal_case> So, I'm working with tabs in jQueryUI... when I realize that the API has been rewritten as of March, meaning that the bleeding edge, which I'm using, has new syntax in addition to supporting the old (http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/03/tabs-api-redesign/). I would like to move to the new syntax, but can't find a complete API reference anywhere. I found this (reference http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138085/Tabs), but it doesn'
[06:41:03] <gabriel9> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/JfNfx/2/
[06:42:56] <gabriel9> maybe there is some other stuff in the api that i don't see
[06:43:06] <gabriel9> for getting cloned element
[06:43:21] <terminal_case> So, I suppose my question is, does anyone have a complete jquery ui tabs widget API reference, or at least know how the new API is used?
[06:43:42] <Guest94337> Hello guys..
[06:43:46] <xec> gabriel9: i'm not entirely sure what you want to do
[06:43:56] <Guest94337> is there a way to use internal methods of a jquery plugin?
[06:44:08] <xec> gabriel9: you can drag any item multiple times into the sort-list ?
[06:44:26] <gabriel9> y
[06:44:27] <terminal_case> Guest94337: Maybe. I think it depends on how it's written.
[06:44:50] <nVee> sup guys, I need to attach a div (or some basic html copy) to my mouse pointer when hovering over a imagemap. Does anyone have a good resource, tutorial or plugin I can use to accomplish this?
[06:44:54] <gabriel9> problem is i wish to take that clone which is dropped when he is dropped
[06:45:05] <gabriel9> and manipulate him
[06:46:05] <terminal_case> nVee: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1328723/how-to-generate-a-simple-popup-using-jquery and attach to onhover event instead of click.
[06:46:21] <xec> gabriel9: like, the item i dragged from becomes red?
[06:46:33] <terminal_case> Guest94337: Which plugin are we talking about?
[06:46:36] <Guest94337> i'm using this plugin: https://raw.github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/master/experiments/scrollview/jquery.mobile.scrollview.js
[06:46:59] <Guest94337> and i'm trying to use the "setScrollPosition" and getScrollPosition" methods
[06:47:05] <nVee> terminal_case: Can I get the popup to "follow" the cursor tho?
[06:47:32] <smplstk> nVee: just use a plugin
[06:47:35] <smplstk> nVee: http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-tooltip/
[06:47:53] <smplstk> mouseover the download link to see an example.
[06:47:53] <gabriel9> no, the item which is dropped
[06:47:59] <gabriel9> he is needed to change
[06:48:11] <gabriel9> something like this

[06:48:20] <skylamer`> hello any one here a fluent with the addon called 'Waypoints' ? :)
[06:49:23] <joyf> hello guys, I am trying to find out whether my html page already has a checkbox with a particular value
[06:49:38] <joyf> $("input:checkbox[value=" + address + "]").is(":visible") seems to get the job done but it has a few problems
[06:49:51] <stephenhoogendij> guys, question. i get a valid json object and parse it so:var ret = jQuery.parseJSON(data);
[06:50:13] <stephenhoogendij> but i can't get the length of an object   console.log(ret['failedmessages'].length);
[06:50:20] <stephenhoogendij> what am i doing wrong?
[06:51:02] <terminal_case> Guest94337: I think the simplest way would be to take them out of the plugin and use the functions by themselves.... someone correct me if there's a way to do this though.
[06:51:52] <joyf> I want to prevent the addition of multiple checkboxs with the same value but it seems that the above expression evaluates to true if I first create a checkbox with a value 1234
[06:52:01] <joyf> then one with a value 123
[06:52:11] <gabriel9> ui.item and ui.sender point to the same element
[06:52:15] <joyf> any ideas on how to get around this?
[06:52:22] <gabriel9> which is element who is dragger
[06:52:25] <gabriel9> dragged
[06:53:01] <smplstk> stephenhoogendij: length is not a property of an object by default.
[06:53:19] <smplstk> stephenhoogendij: is your intention to loop over all the key value pairs in your obj?
[06:53:35] <stephenhoogendij> @smplstk yes jQuery.each(ret['failedmessages'], function(key,val){
[06:53:48] <stephenhoogendij> but i would prefer to check if it even has any values
[06:54:05] <smplstk> is ret['failedmessages'] an array?
[06:54:12] <stephenhoogendij> a json object
[06:54:26] <stephenhoogendij> its a json object inside a json object actually
[06:54:27] <smplstk> but you said earlier that ret was the json object.
[06:54:42] <stephenhoogendij> see above hehe
[06:54:49] <terminal_case> joyf: You could check the length of the jquery object rather than checking for visibility, for one thing.
[06:54:54] <smplstk> stephenhoogendij: that should work then.
[06:55:19] <stephenhoogendij> full code: https://gist.github.com/554d3b3d6aea0c12e6ca
[06:55:59] <xec> gabriel9: i think i understand what you want now, but not sure how to achieve it, fiddled a bit and this was the closest i got: http://jsfiddle.net/JfNfx/3/
[06:56:00] <terminal_case> joyf: Like, the length of the object returned by your checkbox selector. Like so: $("input:checkbox[value=" + address + "]").length
[06:56:32] <terminal_case> And then, if that length is zero, you can assume there are no checkboxes. If it isn't, do whatever you do for when there are.
[06:56:39] <Guest94337> terminal_case thank you.. i think i'm going to try and extract the methods
[06:56:50] <joyf> hmmm... thanks terminal_case
[06:57:05] <xec> gabriel9: this has the obvious drawback of coloring the draggable regardless of where/if it is dropped anywhere
[06:57:18] <terminal_case> Guest94337: No problem.
[06:57:36] <terminal_case> joyf: You're welcome. Not sure this will solve your current problem, but it's a start I think.
[06:57:38] <gabriel9> xec thanks
[06:57:48] <gabriel9> i found hack
[06:57:55] <xec> ok cool
[06:58:09] <gabriel9> adding orig class to list and on drop remove it
[06:58:34] <gabriel9> when it is added it only have orig class and i can find it, after that remove :)
[06:58:56] <gabriel9> maybe there is better way but this is work for now
[06:59:54] <smplstk> stephenhoogendij: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/Qe7rW/
[07:00:08] <smplstk> works for me, either the obj isn't getting parsed right, or something?
[07:00:22] <smplstk> but that's basically what you'll get, of course, this isn't using json
[07:00:35] <stephenhoogendij> @smplstk got it working by removing the .length
[07:00:54] <stephenhoogendij> it doesnt work, which is kind of sad. If you want to cound you need to loop through it and do ++counter
[07:00:59] <stephenhoogendij> very, very annoying
[07:01:01] <stephenhoogendij> thanks smplstk
[07:01:27] <stephenhoogendij> *count
[07:01:35] <smplstk> I should have taken a closer look at your code, lol
[07:02:08] <smplstk> stephenhoogendij: ah yes
[07:02:12] <smplstk> if(ret['failedmessages'].length > 0){}
[07:02:27] <smplstk> that would never fire on an object without a .length prop
[07:02:27] <stephenhoogendij> yeah that failed
[07:02:39] <stephenhoogendij> hehe
[07:03:20] <terminal_case> Does anyone know how the new jQueryUI Tabs API is used? In particular the new "refresh" method that is to replace "add/delete", whether it will support the "sortable" option anymore, and whether there is a way to automatically add "close" icons to tabs through an option?

[07:22:59] <rethus> how can i read-out the style-attribute from img, and use float-tag, fir the list, if used in image?
[07:26:27] <safani> Hello
[07:26:45] <smplstk> HI safani!
[07:26:45] <skylamer`> may be check if the img has the float porperty and then add it with the lis contanier :)
[07:26:45] <safani> I have a script that has worked since I got to this job
[07:27:07] <puppen> rethus: Something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/puppen/NkVtf/3/
[07:27:11] <safani> but now...its like the onclick event for buttons only works with the first button
[07:27:20] <safani> all buttons have the same ID
[07:27:30] <safani> its the craziest thing to me...?
[07:27:59] <safani> there is pagination for the app, a small Q&A system
[07:28:14] <smplstk> skylamer`: just use .css()
[07:28:34] <scar2> how do i create a button the same way the dialog buttons work?
[07:28:39] <safani> when i go to page 2 the first answer button posts the ajax request as expected, the second and subsequent buttons do nothing, no post at all
[07:28:41] <monk13> hey all, i had a general js question... http://jsfiddle.net/uT3Sg/ i was curious what is going on with that first uncommented code. What does (a) do exactly here... It doesn't execute it immediately so not sure.
[07:29:46] <safani> what would cause a problem like that...i don't even know where to begin troubleshooting, because one button works...this is crazy
[07:30:05] <monk13> I posted the other 2 commented examples to understand i have a feeling why those don't work and work. not sure about first though hehe
[07:30:10] <skylamer`> smplstk
[07:30:11] <skylamer`> for w ?
[07:30:23] <skylamer`> are toy
[07:30:35] <skylamer`> are you sure that CSS can handle all of what i want there ?
[07:30:37] <monk13> safani...
[07:30:44] <monk13> all have the same id?
[07:30:53] <Zeph88> I have a tabs setup, from the first tab I'd like to be able to show/endable tabs depending on items chosen in a check list. I found the demo page for this on the website - bnut do not fully understand what they mean. Does someone have an example?
[07:30:53] <scar2> When using jquery, I can set buttons: using the dialog code, but how do I just create an actual button like an input button or a link that gets styled with the jquery theme?
[07:31:19] <monk13> well thats illegal yes? so if you have mult buttons with same id, and do $("#theID").css(...)... it'll error on some browsers i would think
[07:31:52] <monk13> safani,  add a class to all of them and do $('.theClass').css(...) ... //unless im misunderstanding your situation.
[07:32:20] <rethus>  puppen: exactly. didn't know, that it was so simple
[07:32:24] <rethus> thankx
[07:32:35] <smplstk> skylamer`: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/26q6S/
[07:32:47] <monk13> safani,  it makes sense to me the first button works if thats the case. it only will work on first id, and the browser might only say the first one is a valid ID. (guessin')
[07:33:19] <rethus>  puppen: but what, if float: right isn't the first param of attribute style?
[07:33:51] <safani> ok
[07:34:08] <safani> This was not my script though...it worked before I'm told
[07:34:20] <monk13> safani, you prob got a browser upgrade that now is more strict.
[07:34:34] <monk13> and interprets things more 'correctly'
[07:34:46] <monk13> aka you can't have more than one ID for something.
[07:34:49] <safani> ok that makes more sense.
[07:34:51] <monk13> add a class on those buttons.
[07:34:57] <monk13> and use the class.
[07:35:00] <safani> yea right...the definition of class and id
[07:35:07] <safani> ill try that out
[07:35:11] <monk13> cool.
[07:35:28] <puppen> rethus: I don't think I quite understand.. that should return style as an object of all the styles applied to the img (or w/e is in your loop).. It should matter what order your styles are in...
[07:35:49] <scar2> How do I submit a form using jquery? I want to use it for a button.
[07:40:18] <monk13> Any JS masters look at my jsfiddle example (http://jsfiddle.net/uT3Sg/)?... I read alot of 'JS: the Good Parts' past few days and that was an example i came up with that I wasn't sure why it was valid JS.
[07:41:25] <puppen> rethus: im sorry.. http://jsfiddle.net/puppen/NkVtf/6/ is a better way to go about getting the style.. the first i posted /will most likely not work in IE/ :(
[07:44:18] <scar2> I am trying to have a dialog button submit my form with ID "booknowform". my button code is here: http://pastebin.com/225eLTUm
[07:44:57] <scar2> i also tried this: http://pastebin.com/Q28R4Bjq
[07:48:28] <rethus> puppen: k, thanks. now i have made this, based upon your example:_ http://jsfiddle.net/NkVtf/8/
[07:48:31] <rethus> thanks a lot

[07:51:27] <lolgolflol> Hi.
[07:51:52] <lolgolflol> Test Sound.
[07:52:07] <rethus> question is.. how could i use my own placeholder in longdesc... like #copyright# &copy; imagestack.com #copyright
[07:53:02] <lolgolflol> sry i dunno.
[07:53:10] <morphles> when using .each() how do i pass function that is declared, not simply giving function in place? I seem to be unable to do that.
[07:53:15] <lolgolflol> i am newbie.
[07:54:41] <rethus> how can i get the text between *quelle* in this text  longdesc="Für den Ernstfall vorsorgen, mit einer Patientenverfügung. *quelle* sxc.hu *quelle*".........>
[07:55:23] <scar2> I can't even get my submit button to submit my form.... a standard button triggering a form to submit? http://pastebin.com/HVQy96aM
[07:56:07] <lolgolflol> document.form.submit()
[07:56:27] <scar2> lolgolflol: how do i set it to trigger a particular form with an ID?
[07:57:08] <terminal_case> Nevermind. Found something. For anyone else using jQuery UI tabs that wants to know where to find info on the usage of the new API, check out the demos on github at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/demos/tabs/
[07:58:37] <puppen> rethus: you could perhaps use regex to get it out?
[07:58:39] <lolgolflol> sry I dunno.
[08:00:39] <rethus> i will slice it out of longdesc, and create a new dl with it. You think ..indexOf, ...slice... and replace... (native JS functions) will do this, or are there one nice jquery, who can handle this?
[08:03:58] <puppen> rethus: sounds like it could work.. i dunno about anything jquery specific that would help out.. i threw together a simple idea with the use of regex at http://jsfiddle.net/puppen/NkVtf/10/ ..
[08:05:09] <Zeph88> Is there a shorter way to write this? I feel like I'm being redundant... http://paste2.org/p/1754396
[08:06:56] <lduros> hello, trying to get all script elements that have a script attribute and no other, what would be the best way to do this?
[08:07:06] <lduros> that have a src attribute I meant
[08:07:50] <rethus> puppen: great solution, thanks
[08:08:51] <puppen> No problem.. If you get out both matches first though, it will be more efficient.. see my update (/11) to see what i mean.. but im sure youll work it out :)
[08:11:26] <lduros> oh so it would be $('script[src]'); interesting :-)

[08:53:28] <CannedCorn> guys, i'm bumping into same origin policy until i add callback=? to my url
[08:53:38] <CannedCorn> but then when the results are returned I'm getting an error
[08:54:27] <CannedCorn> it seems to be interpreting the json as a script
[08:55:15] <keith_> by adding callback=? you make it a jsonp request
[08:55:42] <keith_> jsonp requests is a script
[08:58:02] <CannedCorn> is there a way to have it interpreted as json
[08:58:15] <jsick3> what version of jquery is needed for jquery tools?
[08:58:20] <CannedCorn> keith_ i have to use this cause json request gives me access control policy error
[08:58:37] <CannedCorn> so is there a way to process that as json
[09:00:50] <Fernandos> Is it possible to listen to clicks using a wildcard on <a href="#prefix_something">notice</a> and animate <input id="prefix_something" /> ?
[09:01:09] <Fernandos> so I have one rule for all id's ?

[09:12:56] <Fernandos> puppen: :) I'm sorry, when I click the anchor I wanted the related input to animate. Not the input when I click the input.
[09:13:29] <puppen> Fernandos: http://jsfiddle.net/XM5YK/6/
[09:13:39] <puppen> sorry.. wrong link

[09:14:22] <pashmi56> hi there, i am trying to load some json feed as page scrolls down. i have my own custom json file. when page first loads it loads 5 feeds. then i have have no idea how to print the next 5?? sorry but i totally new to this
[09:14:39] <safani> monk13: Your were right on the money, thankyou.
[09:14:50] <monk13> yay, :)
[09:14:56] <puppen> Fernandos: But in that case, the ^ in the selector for the input is kinda redundant..
[09:15:08] <ccmonster> http://pastie.org/2799563 - not sure what I am doing wrong here. anyone know a way around my issue?
[09:16:00] <Fernandos> oh wow, I was thinking of that, but you implemented it in the same time! thanks puppen !! I thought maybe jquery can inherit a wildcard selector to it's child and I could prepend a different tag, but getting the clicked elements name and replacing the prefix is a nice way also.
[09:18:28] <puppen> Fernandos: You could do something like http://jsfiddle.net/puppen/XM5YK/8/
[09:18:31] <puppen> :)
[09:18:46] <scar2> How do I pull the custom icons that comes with the jquery framework? I want to use the Calendar Icon that comes with my themeroller.
[09:19:06] <Fernandos> puppen: holy cow!
[09:19:16] * puppen mooos
[09:19:28] <Fernandos> hahah :D man I thought that's not even possible..
[09:19:29] <pashmi56> hey, how can i say in getJson to get feed from # to # ??
[09:19:52] <puppen> Fernandos: Anythings possible.. http://zombo.com
[09:20:18] <supsup> ccmonster why not make jsfiddle example
[09:20:19] <danner> puppen, remember that IE hates opacity.
[09:20:27] <Fernandos> hahaha awesome
[09:20:47] <puppen> Thanks for bringing that up danner :)
[09:20:58] <futini> hello #jquery, help whit this please http://jsfiddle.net/PkELz/ i try select the third checkbox
[09:21:02] <danner> puppen, oh, that wasn't the point, was it ;-)
[09:21:40] <puppen> ?
[09:22:07] <danner> looks like the point was an interesting selector. not the animation.
[09:22:39] <tomasm-> hi, i have a textarea that i type some text in and i want it to produce a png image on the same page OF that text, and im wondering if its possible to somehow post the form and have it generate an image, or if i need to have an ajax call that stores the text in the session and then call a dynamic image generator that will read it from that session
[09:23:03] <puppen> danner: Just tested it in IE 6/7/8 and it works fine..
[09:23:05] <helpcrypto> hi all
[09:23:11] <helpcrypto> one simple/fast question
[09:23:34] <helpcrypto> if i try to make an ajax request to another domain using https
[09:23:56] <helpcrypto> and the certificate is not installed/validated on my browser
[09:24:14] <helpcrypto> firefox shows a "warning" window
[09:24:24] <helpcrypto> and the request(ajax) is aborted
[09:24:36] <helpcrypto> BUT, no error code, status or whatever is returned
[09:24:40] <JdpB42> need some guru guidance
[09:24:56] <helpcrypto> after installing the certificate, didnt either return a status 200 code
[09:25:27] <JdpB42> i have a hover  happening but i have no idea where the code is for it .....any way I can use firebug to intercept and see the jquery function call so I can trace down where it is?
[09:25:43] <helpcrypto> i understand there are cross-domain issues here, but didnt xmlhttprequest return any code or header of any of these cases to detect the problem?
[09:26:46] <helpcrypto> in other words...is there a tricky way to know if a https request could be done/returned a page ? or failed due cross-domain rather than "no cert installed" ?
[09:27:11] <JdpB42> anyone?
[09:27:49] <danner> JdpB42, grep?
[09:28:14] <JdpB42> isn't there a way where i can do it in the browser and see it on command danner ?
[09:28:15] <danner> JdpB42, or capturing/logging events
[09:28:18] <Eviltwin> JdpB42: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/570960/how-to-debug-javascript-jquery-event-bindings-with-firebug-or-similar-tool
[09:28:32] <jrockjiggz> Believes or Beliefs?
[09:29:02] <helpcrypto> ...is there a way to know if a https request could be done/returned a page ? or failed due cross-domain rather than "no trusted cert" ?
[09:29:07] <tomasm-> hi, is it possible to encode the text in a textarea so it can be passed as a parameter in a query string? i'm trying to generate dynamic images based on text typed in.
[09:29:43] <JdpB42> danner: can it log / capture a hover event?
[09:30:16] <Eviltwin> JdpB42: http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/scripts-breakpoints.html#listeners
[09:30:23] <jrockjiggz> tomasm-: $('textarea').val();
[09:31:05] <tomasm-> jrockjiggz, well yeah, but if its multiple lines, got weird characters, etc it needs to be encoded so i can append it to a query string for a url i am calling (I can't use post)
[09:31:07] <Eviltwin> tomasm-: encodeURIComponent
[09:31:32] <jrockjiggz> urlEncode( $('textarea').val() );
[09:31:52] <jrockjiggz> tomasm-: then you can post with it
[09:32:06] <tomasm-> jrockjiggz, no i cant 'post' , i have to use 'get'
[09:32:16] <jrockjiggz> yes you can post with urlEncode()
[09:33:08] <jrockjiggz> tomasm-: sorry it's actually encodeURI()
[09:33:10] <tomasm-> jrockjiggz, i mean i am dynamically setting the url of an image, passing data to the php side so it can spit out an image.
[09:33:29] <jita> I am using jquery chosen in in my application with multiple select widget. So i can select multiple values in my form but it returns only last value selected not multiple values. any hint ?
[09:33:40] <Eviltwin> tomasm-: Why don't you make a jsFiddle or something
[09:33:45] <Eviltwin> If we haven't answered your question yet
[09:34:05] <jrockjiggz> jita: does your form have unique names for each select element?
[09:34:49] <jita> jrockjiggz: there is only single select element in my form
[09:35:06] <tomasm-> encoding the text works fine, just that i need to use 'get' instead of 'post', like jrockjiggz is suggesting. cant really make a jsfiddle when this is just theoretical. I have a textarea, an an image on the side, and when i submit the textarea, the image should reload with the words i entered (using php-gd).
[09:35:12] <jita> jrockjiggz: and i want to select multiple options and pass them as comma separated to the backend
[09:35:15] <devc> Am I confused on .children()? I'm using var stillLoading = chr.children('.loading'); to look for <img class="loading"> within a <span> where our character's correctly been grabbed like: var chr = $('.character');
[09:35:17] <jrockjiggz> jita: then how are you to have multiple?
[09:35:44] <Eviltwin> devc: You probably want .find
[09:36:00] <Eviltwin> .children is immediate children
[09:36:04] <Eviltwin> That you then filter down
[09:36:07] <jita> jrockjiggz: a single select with multiple options like for instance select image tags, so i can select multiple tags for an image
[09:36:09] <mekab> \a
[09:36:21] <devc> Essentially I want to grab all .loading elements within the span, but it returns itself right now... not sure if that's because it's coming back with nothing or because it's not grabbing correctly.
[09:36:22] <Eviltwin> devc: .find is any descendant of the children
[09:36:26] <tomasm-> Eviltwin, where is encodeURIComponent() ? i am getting confusing results on google
[09:36:28] <Eviltwin> of the node*
[09:36:40] <Eviltwin> In the JavaScript window
[09:36:40] <jrockjiggz> tomasm-: then use ajax() to submit your form, and use the returned data to replace the image
[09:36:45] <devc> Eviltwin: Okay, I can try that. In this case there will ONLY be image's inside, but let me switch it over and see.
[09:37:10] <Eviltwin> tomasm-: You should be able to just type encodeURIComponent("Hello, World!")
[09:37:15] <Eviltwin> In JavaScript and have it work
[09:37:41] <tomasm-> Eviltwin, oh, thats core js?
[09:37:47] <Eviltwin> tomasm-: Yup
[09:37:57] <Eviltwin> That's why it has an obnoxiously long name
[09:38:10] <jita> jrockjiggz: cant chosen send comma seperated multiple values into a single field ?
[09:38:27] <jrockjiggz> jita: in your php try: print_r($_REQUEST) to see all the data being passed, you can disect it from there..
[09:38:47] <tomasm-> jrockjiggz, what data would i return that could replace the image? a url? an encoded image data? i dont follow
[09:38:54] <jita> jrockjiggz: only the last selected option in multiple select gets passed
[09:38:57] <Eviltwin> jita: Did you look at http://api.jquery.com/serialize/ ?
[09:39:29] <jrockjiggz> jita: i'd have to see some code, can you paste jsfiddle.net
[09:39:56] <Eviltwin> tomasm-: Via AJAX you can make a POST and the result can be the data for an image
[09:40:16] <jrockjiggz> tomasm-: you can return a src url for the image tag.  then in your result function update the src attr
[09:41:05] <jita> Eviltwin: i am not using get to post data, I have multiple tags for example tag1, tag2, tag3. I want the user select multiple tags from this list, not create new one. So if he selects tag1 and tag2, it gets passed as tag1, tag2 to the input field. I am using POST to submit data
[09:41:52] <Eviltwin> jita: You do know that regardless of the method used, form data is always serialized the same way
[09:41:57] <jrockjiggz> tomasm-: $.ajax({ type: "GET", url: url, success: function(data){ $('img.class').attr( data ); } });
[09:42:36] <Elephant> $.post(url, $()
[09:42:43] <supsup> futini : ghetto way to do it: http://jsfiddle.net/PkELz/1/  sure there is a 1 liner for this lol
[09:45:08] <supsup> this works too sorta.  it's your use of next v
[09:45:09] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/PkELz/2/
[09:53:36] <jita> Is there any jquery tags script which restricts user creating new tags ?
[09:53:44] <jita> and only limit them using pre defined tags
[09:55:09] <jrockjiggz> no
[09:55:54] <futini> thanks supsup!
[09:57:41] <amh345> anyone available for freelance starting now for the next few hours?
[10:02:45] <SerpentX> hey
[10:03:17] <SerpentX> anyone know how to do the dialog boxes, i just want to do a Add/Edit dialog form
[10:03:53] <SerpentX> i'm just stuck because i'm trying to use django autoforms from model
[10:04:15] <SerpentX> and i'm not sure how to get the data into the form from javascript
[10:04:21] <SerpentX> or maybe u have another method
[10:11:49] <ccmonster> ok, back. sorry.
[10:12:02] <ccmonster> i would make a fiddle, but then i'd have to use my api-id
[10:12:19] <ccmonster> supsup:
[10:12:37] <kanzie> if I want to iterate over a json-object…should I use $.each(myJSON) or for (i in myJSON)
[10:12:46] <kanzie> and add the hasProperty-check
[10:14:25] <eddiemonge> kanzie: for will be faster
[10:14:50] <devc> Yo guys, I'm looking for best coding practises here.. I have span'
[10:14:50] <devc> s
[10:15:19] <devc>  with 'loading' classes.. Now I'm trying to check is the span has class loading as it gets removed once loaded.
[10:15:28] <devc> var isLoaded=$(".character").is('.loading');
[10:15:46] <liebrand> hi there, i'm using $.get to load a file (an html template) which works fine most of the time since it calls my success callback with a string containing the data of the template.  But in one instance it returns me an actual document object rather than a string.  The documentation just says it can return one or the other, but how do i force it to return just a simple data string?
[10:15:51] <devc> except I actually want that variable to be named isNotLoaded, because if we get 'loading' classes, it returns 'true'
[10:16:15] <jrockjiggz> devc: i think replace is() with hasClass()
[10:16:22] <ccmonster> hey eddiemonge , having an issue with a json response from the new york times api, any chance you could take a look?
[10:16:32] <devc> What's the 'proper' way to go about that, var isNotLoaded? or var isLoading, or ... what do you recommend.
[10:17:46] <eddiemonge> devc: unless you ahve that in an if statement, $('.character.loading') would be a better approach as it will only grab those elements that have both classes
[10:18:34] <eddiemonge> ccmonster: jsonp?
[10:18:40] <ccmonster> yeap.
[10:18:49] <devc> eddiemonge & jrockjiggz: between .is, .hasClass, and .character.loading -- which is best?
[10:18:49] <ccmonster> http://pastie.org/2799563
[10:18:55] <eddiemonge> liebrand: you need to specify a datatype
[10:19:10] <liebrand> eddiemonge: thanks, just did that and bob is my uncle :-)
[10:19:12] <liebrand> thanks
[10:19:21] <jrockjiggz> devc: i think you are better to appending/replacing your ajaxDiv with a loading Div, and then after you get your returned data, replace that ajaxDiv with your data thus replacing any existing loading span
[10:19:23] <eddiemonge> devc: like i said, if its in an if, hasClass is better but if you are just selecting the elements, the combined .class.class2 is better
[10:20:04] <james13433> Can anybody help me out with this issue http://jsbin.com/obanor/2/edit
[10:20:20] <ccmonster> any idea eddiemonge
[10:20:25] <eddiemonge> ccmonster: whats the problem?
[10:20:28] <ccmonster> http://pastie.org/2799563
[10:20:37] <eddiemonge> i mean whats happening with it?
[10:20:59] <eddiemonge> james13433: what is that for?
[10:21:27] <james13433> edditmonge, its for some custom options with prices.
[10:22:31] <ccmonster> it says on the pastie what the error is
[10:23:52] <eddiemonge> ccmonster: where is that error showing though? does it say what line number it is on?
[10:24:05] <devc> eddiemonge: Thanks.
[10:24:10] <ccmonster> it says, suggest:1
[10:24:23] <ccmonster> which when i click it, is actually the response the nytimes gives back.
[10:24:33] <eddiemonge> james13433: im confused as to the jquery aspect of the request, and slightly to the whole request in general
[10:24:40] <ccmonster> so its not understanding the response to be json, because I think its sent with a mime type plain/text
[10:24:50] <JAAulde> g'morning, jQuerians
[10:25:03] <james13433> eddiemonge, there is no jquery aspect, but all the other javascript related irc's are crap.
[10:25:31] <MaryJ1982> Anyone here worked with qtip or qtip2?
[10:27:05] <eddiemonge> ccmonster: that doesnt sound like it would be the problem. have you jsonlinted the actual response?
[10:27:27] <eddiemonge> james13433: it seems excessive
[10:27:45] <jiggliemon> Out of curiosity, how does jQuery handle the DOMContentLoaded event if loading jQuery async (via javascript) ex: document.createElement('script') ...
[10:28:02] <james13433> ediiemonge how do you mean? lots of code? or the simple thing?
[10:28:51] <eddiemonge> james13433: seems like excessive arrays but what is the problem with it though?
[10:28:56] <jiggliemon> does it assume if document.head, document.body are available - that DOMContentLoaded is fired?
[10:29:32] <ryanneufeld> jiggliemon: open the source code and find out
[10:29:38] <ccmonster> yes I have eddiemonge
[10:29:42] <ryanneufeld> jiggliemon: it's open source, that's the fun!
[10:29:59] <jrockjiggz> james13433: http://jsbin.com/obanor/4/edit
[10:30:08] <jiggliemon> It's the worst source to read...
[10:30:39] <jiggliemon> If jQuery were a bible character - it'd be Job.
[10:31:28] <eddiemonge> jiggliemon: are you serious? I think jquery source is beautiful to look at and read
[10:32:10] <james13433> jrocksjiggz, thats that make sense, there is one more element to it though, they I need them grouped by the name of the label, which is stored in another array, so all the inputs with the label <lable>dave</label>
[10:32:32] <james13433> in one array and <lable>john in another.</label>
[10:33:37] <eddiemonge> jrockjiggz: slight optimization and error correction to your code http://jsbin.com/obanor/5/edit
[10:33:54] <eddiemonge> oops, drop the paren after the this in this.value
[10:34:03] <MaryJ1982> Any way to pass an array in php to jquery?
[10:34:04] <jrockjiggz> james13433: http://jsbin.com/obanor/7/edit
[10:34:47] <eddiemonge> MaryJ1982: the question is how to get data from the backend using jquery
[10:35:02] <eddiemonge> and for that you would use something like ajax or have the data embedded in the page
[10:35:24] <MaryJ1982> Well, how to get data generated in php, then taking jquery to do something based on what dynamic data is in that data "array"
[10:35:34] <james13433> Thanks jrockjiggz,
[10:35:39] <jita> somebody please tell me if there is a way to select multiple options using select input and sends back comma separated values? I am currently using chosen but it only passes the last selected option to the server.
[10:35:42] <jita> please guide me
[10:35:44] <eddiemonge> MaryJ1982: use an ajax request. see ? post
[10:35:45] <bot-t> MaryJ1982, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[10:35:55] <Jon47> MaryJ1982 generally I think you want to use JSON for that
[10:36:24] <eddiemonge> jita: does your select element have multiple attribute set? if so, you could use see ? serialize
[10:36:25] <bot-t> jita, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[10:36:48] <MaryJ1982> Jon47:  Yeah. I was thinking os.  The array I speak of is controlled by Wordpress which is php based. I know all the possible values for that array.  Those wont changee.  Which ones (of that array) which are showing or not is what will change
[10:37:14] <Jon47> use encode_json
[10:37:28] <Jon47> er.. json_encode
[10:37:29] <Jon47> http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php
[10:37:51] <Jon47> and then http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[10:37:58] <ccmonster> any thoughts?
[10:38:03] <Jon47> or http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[10:38:05] <jita> eddiemonge: http://dpaste.com/646171/, i want to set the value of "tags" to "1,2" if user selects 2 values in this. Could you please have a look ?
[10:38:24] <context> php.net/json ... php has AMAZING docs, use them
[10:39:53] <guy> likely jQuery bug. https://gist.github.com/a751a1e195d6b5314cfd currency_selector has 'click' event. Once that is triggered, jQuery is supposed to bind $(document) click event. However, the latter event is immediately triggered (without click anything second time).
[10:39:57] <frewsxcv> i have to agree, despite being a relatively meh language, they have pretty good docs
[10:40:24] <guy> clicking*
[10:41:14] <jita> eddiemonge: in similar vein to checkboxes
[10:42:49] <eddiemonge> jita: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/PwhHn/
[10:43:29] <CannedCorn> hey guys
[10:43:41] <CannedCorn> use the google maps api
[10:44:02] <eddiemonge> guy: what is currency_selector? what type of element
[10:44:25] <guy> div
[10:45:10] <eddiemonge> guy: can you put it on jsfiddle and explain whats happening or see if it happens there?
[10:45:40] <eddiemonge> CannedCorn: what if i dont want to?
[10:46:04] <jita> eddiemonge: tags=test&tags=sasa&tags=red, this is not what i want, i want tags=test,sasa,red
[10:46:14] <jita> eddiemonge: console log outputs tags=test&tags=sasa&tags=red
[10:47:48] <eddiemonge> jita: thats whats supposed to happen
[10:48:03] <eddiemonge> are you going to be sending this to a backend using ajax?
[10:48:16] <jita> eddiemonge: no i am using form submit
[10:48:40] <jita> eddiemonge: so i want to somehow set the field of tags to csv before submitting
[10:49:14] <CannedCorn> http://jsfiddle.net/mefPM/
[10:49:21] <CannedCorn> i'm trying to get this to work, works ok in my app
[10:49:32] <CannedCorn> but i can't seem to look inside data that is returned
[10:49:46] <CannedCorn> lt looks to be of type object, so it should be straightforward
[10:50:24] <eddiemonge> jita: why are you not using json? and if you are doing a normal submit, then it should matter in javascript as your backend should handle it fine
[10:56:00] <ccmonster> i have no clue why i cant do this damn jsonp. makes no sense
[10:56:28] <eddiemonge> because its the NYT
[10:56:57] <ccmonster> well im trying freebase now too
[10:57:11] <ccmonster> the freebase is giving me a origin null response as well
[10:57:24] <jaequery> anyone know about where online you can create 'roadmaps' thats beautiful?
[10:57:35] <ccmonster> im just getting a 400 response bad, but that makes no sense
[10:59:37] <kanzie> I have a JSON-object with a few values and one function. Depending on these values I want to return a state from the function. How can I access these values from within the function_
[10:59:37] <kanzie> ?
[11:00:41] <ccmonster> why is the damn thing putting the callback before the data in the ajax request
[11:00:45] <ccmonster> makes no damn sense lol
[11:01:07] <eddiemonge> jaequery: you mean a gh wiki isnt beautiful?
[11:01:21] <eddiemonge> ccmonster: thats a page error
[11:01:21] <crankharder> var iframe is an iframe that's already loaded on the page -- if I do something like $('body').prepend(iframe) it's triggering the load() event.  why is it doing that if it's already loaded?
[11:01:26] <ccmonster> yes. i know
[11:02:44] <jaequery> hm your right, GH wiki IS beuatiful
[11:02:54] <jaequery> i think im just thinking too hard
[11:02:55] <jaequery> lol
[11:03:19] <kanzie> got it…just reference with this…its in the scope
[11:04:36] <thomedy> im trying to catch an event fired on jquery... so i googled and found Jquery.event('click');
[11:04:44] <thomedy> but it doesn't seem to be work
[11:06:15] <jayar> $('#target').click()
[11:06:35] <thomedy> that triggers a click event i want to catch one
[11:06:42] <thomedy> i want to know what was clicked arbitrarily
[11:06:46] <thomedy> thank you though
[11:07:01] <jayar> o
[11:07:18] <thomedy> so i can right a function that throws the id into and reanimates
[11:07:37] <thomedy> but mostly i need to know arbitrarily what id i just clicked
[11:08:10] <danner> $('').click(function(event){console.log(event)});?
[11:08:58] <thomedy> lemme try and pre thank you
[11:09:04] <saba> $('document')
[11:09:06] <danner> maybe $.click(function(event){console.log(event)});
[11:09:20] <danner> ah, saba got it, i've got a bad memory.
[11:09:54] <jayar> what about getID()
[11:10:18] <danner> event.target is the thing that got clicked

[11:10:40] <eddiemonge> saba: its $(document) actually. not quotes
[11:12:02] <danner> jayar, you can also use $(event.target).fadeOut(); or whatever.
[11:12:19] <jayar> werd
[11:14:55] <saba> eddiemonge: so true
[11:15:40] <pmcgovern> hello everyone
[11:15:49] <jayar> hello
[11:16:16] <pmcgovern> I have a function that iterated through every input field, but it doesn't grab text areas, checkboxes or radio buttons: $("input").each(function() {     | how do I get it to hit them all without repeating the function for each?
[11:17:10] <eddiemonge> pmcgovern: :input
[11:17:11] <saba> pmcgovern: $('input,select,textarea')
[11:17:20] <eddiemonge> ?:input @ pmcgovern
[11:17:21] <pmcgovern> saba - that's what I was looking for - thank you!
[11:17:21] <bot-t> pmcgovern, :input: Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements. http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[11:17:32] <pmcgovern> even cleaner, eddiemonge
[11:17:53] <CannedCorn> guys is there a way to wait to call a function until geocoding is finished
[11:21:53] <eddiemonge> CannedCorn: settimeout or see if the geocoding function has a callback api
[11:22:01] <CannedCorn> it does, cool
[11:22:03] <CannedCorn> thanks eddiemonge
[11:22:47] <pmcgovern> if I have a function that returns true or false, how do I check the status? this isn't working: if ($(this).validate.init(this) == false){
[11:23:00] <pmcgovern> I tried with '===' like in PHP with no luck
[11:23:51] <eddiemonge> pmcgovern: try console.log(  $(this).validate.init(this)  ) to see whats being returned
[11:24:03] <pmcgovern> eddiemonge: good call
[11:24:39] <pmcgovern> undefined, yet the function is running
[11:24:40] <pmcgovern> weird
[11:27:43] <devc> Hey guys, I have a big Object with a bunch of objects within it. But I don't know how to dynamically call object keys, for example this works: console.log(BookData.page0.page01charactermelvin01.effect); but what if I only have a page ID 'page0', how would I target that key on the second level in my Object?
[11:27:56] <pmcgovern> ok so this is telling me that I am not properly detecting whether a function returns true and false
[11:29:40] <monk13> hey all, i have a table row that after an ajax action, i set the background-color to light green: td.closest('tr').css('background-color','#EFFFEA');    ...  is there a way i can fade the color of the row back to white after 5seconds?
[11:31:07] <devc> monk13: Use jQueryUI's effect 'highlight'

[11:31:19] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> hi
[11:31:34] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> i have a weird 'Missing missing ; before statement' error
[11:31:41] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> i can't find where does it happen
[11:31:43] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> can you help me?
[11:32:04] <chovy> $("li").live('hover', function(e){ console.log('over') }, function(e){ console.log('out') }); /// the out never fires
[11:32:22] <monk13> devc, k i'll check it out. saw that, just didn't want to import the UI libs if jquery could do it.
[11:32:44] <eddiemonge> chovy: i dont think that is valid. .hover() is the only one that takes dual functions i think
[11:32:50] <CannedCorn> is there any way to make something run before an autocomplete is called?
[11:32:59] <bobbytek> Is it possible to check if an ajax request is aborted in a success handler?
[11:33:09] <devc> monk13: you should be able to do it with .css({ backgroundColor: 'red' }).animate({ backgroundColor: 'black'), 2000);
[11:33:13] <eddiemonge> chovy: mouseenter and mouseleave would be what you need
[11:33:13] <bobbytek> maybe by looking at readyState or something?
[11:33:20] <bobbytek> What is the suggested way?
[11:33:33] <eddiemonge> bobbytek: the success handler wont fire if the call is aborted
[11:33:34] <devc> `sudo_kill_1_-9`:  can you provide us with a link?
[11:33:41] <bobbytek> eddiemonge, Not true
[11:33:44] <monk13> k i'll  try it out, thanks devc
[11:33:53] <bobbytek> if I press escape, it will be called
[11:33:55] <chovy> eddiemonge: .live('hover') should be the same as .hover()
[11:33:56] <bobbytek> At least on FF
[11:34:10] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> devc: sure, hold on
[11:34:14] <eddiemonge> bobbytek: thats not aborting the ajax request
[11:34:14] <devc> monk13: obviously that's untested and I'm not great at remembering syntax of stuff but I think that'll work.
[11:34:25] <bobbytek> Is it cancelling?
[11:34:33] <bobbytek> What ever, how can I detect it?
[11:34:34] <eddiemonge> chovy: should be but .hover() is a convenience method, not an actual event
[11:35:03] <eddiemonge> bobbytek: pressing escape doesnt do anything for ajax requests reliably i think but ajpiano or gnarf might know better
[11:35:05] <chovy> ok
[11:35:06] <chovy> http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/pPMsh/
[11:35:12] <chovy> Here's a fiddle.
[11:35:17] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> devc: http://www.trolls.lv/js/ff8f111.js
[11:35:21] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> error happens on line 1
[11:35:42] <eddiemonge> chovy: hmm interesting
[11:37:11] <chovy> I filed a ticket
[11:37:12] <chovy> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10640
[11:38:08] <bobbytek> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ajax-triggers-success-callback-on-readystate-4-status-0
[11:39:21] <eddiemonge> chovy: oh i misread the console. like i said, .hover() is a convenience method. here is your solution http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/pPMsh/2/
[11:39:54] <chovy> eddiemonge: i've got that working. But one would think .live() syntax should behave the same way as .hover().
[11:39:57] <chovy> no?
[11:40:01] <eddiemonge> no
[11:40:07] <eddiemonge> live uses events
[11:40:13] <eddiemonge> not methods
[11:41:37] <eddiemonge> chovy: this should better explain it: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/pPMsh/3/
[11:42:17] <chovy> i see
[11:42:36] <chovy> so it gets fired on both mouseenter and mouseleave
[11:43:57] <datlap> i have user picking date using datepicker. how do i simultaneously display that number somewhere else on the same page
[11:44:01] <amh345> last call.  anyone available for some freelance work?   starting around now for the next few hors?
[11:44:03] <amh345> hours*
[11:44:16] <eddiemonge> chovy: yes. so you can check in the function for that and use it that way
[11:44:18] <thomedy> arent variables in js global if theyre defined above everything else and also shouldnt a var = event.target get the event to the variable outside so that i can send it to someother function
[11:44:22] <thomedy> cuz that aint happening
[11:44:26] <eddiemonge> amh345: for what?
[11:45:06] <amh345> eddiemonge: jquery. layout type shit.  some animate()
[11:45:11] <eddiemonge> thomedy var local = localtoscope; novar = globalvar;
[11:45:33] <LabRaTT> datlap i just did this one sec i will create a fiddle
[11:45:51] <datlap> LabRaTT: nice
[11:45:52] <thomedy> hmmm...
[11:45:55] <thomedy> thank you
[11:46:27] <thomedy> wait how does ooh what if i pass it in
[11:46:30] <thomedy> that might work
[11:47:13] <igcewieling> I'm aware of the autocomplete="off" option on a form to prevent the browser from providing a list of previously entered data.   Is there way in jQuery (or plain JS, but prefer jQuery) to populate the autocomplete drop down with my own data?
[11:47:23] <eddiemonge> thomedy: you should pick up a javascript book on scope
[11:47:39] <eddiemonge> igcewieling: jqueryui.com has an example of doing tht
[11:47:55] <scar2> is there a way to have a .js file pull only specific functions throuhg like foo.js?bar ?
[11:47:56] <thomedy> jqueryui. is diff from jquery.com
[11:47:58] <thomedy> is that correct
[11:48:12] <eddiemonge> igcewieling: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
[11:48:18] <eddiemonge> scar2: no
[11:48:33] <eddiemonge> thomedy: jqueryui is built on top of jquery core
[11:48:59] <igcewieling> eddiemonge: thanks!
[11:48:59] <thomedy> yeah i googled it
[11:49:06] <thomedy> i should have figured that out from the ui part
[11:49:08] <thomedy> any way
[11:54:15] <Hopsy> I see an heart
[11:54:27] <LabRaTT> datlap you still here?
[11:54:36] <datlap> yeah
[11:54:51] <LabRaTT> ok one sec i forget how to send the jsfiddle

[11:55:12] <LabRaTT> there you go
[11:55:24] <CannedCorn> if i define a var outside of the jquery namespace how can i get it to be inside of it
[11:55:33] <CannedCorn> whenever i reference it i get undefined
[11:55:59] <LabRaTT> or did you want it in raw text instead?
[12:00:23] <smplstk> CannedCorn: if it's in the global namespace, you should be able to access it anywhere.

[12:05:34] <scar2> Is there a way to make jQuery Dialogs to open to a height based off the content inside the dialog div?

[12:10:02] <epidemicz> this going to require you to sign in to battlelog.battlefield.com.  I'm trying to grab the json data from a page like http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/overviewPopulateStats/280966984/bf3-us-assault/1/
[12:10:48] <epidemicz> $.getJSON fails for me
[12:10:57] <joikus> you guys
[12:11:09] <joikus> $('html,body').animate({ scrollTop: $('#bottomSection').offset().top }
[12:11:15] <joikus> nicely scrolls downwards
[12:11:19] <joikus> but how would I scroll back upwards
[12:12:24] <joikus> scrollBottom doesn't really work doesit? it's choppy scrolls
[12:13:40] <smplstk> joikus: you just want it to scroll to the top of the page?
[12:13:49] <joikus> ya
[12:13:50] <smplstk> $('html,body').animate({ scrollTop: 0 }
[12:13:58] <joikus> ok let me try
[12:13:58] <smplstk> ?
[12:14:37] <joikus> it works but it doesnt slide up
[12:14:42] <joikus> like the way it does when it slides down
[12:14:53] <joikus> $('html,body').animate({ scrollTop: $('#bottomSection').offset().top }     slides down gradually
[12:15:01] <joikus> but when I go to scrollTop:0 it does not
[12:15:45] <smplstk> um, so it's just jumping and not animating?
[12:15:56] <smplstk> try '0px' instead of 0, maybe?
[12:16:01] * smplstk shrugs
[12:16:15] <joikus> no it jumped half way, then animated the rest
[12:16:36] <smplstk> joikus: you must have some other code that's messing up the transition.
[12:17:18] <ohsnap> quick question: is there a shorter way of writing this? http://jsfiddle.net/3jNKA/
[12:17:33] <smplstk> ?os
[12:17:34] <bot-t> oh snao™
[12:17:53] <joikus> ya I have  $('#topSection').show()
[12:17:55] <joikus> right above it
[12:18:01] <joikus>  $('#topSection').show(1200);
[12:18:03] <joikus> fixed it
[12:18:14] <joikus> where 1200 is the same amount .animate uses
[12:19:29] <smplstk> same amount... of time?
[12:19:51] <joikus> $('#topSection').show(750);  $('html,body').animate({ scrollTop: 0 }, 750, function () { $('#bottomSection').hide(); });
[12:19:52] <joikus> this works
[12:20:01] <smplstk> if it works, it works.
[12:20:14] <joikus> but .show(750) is shitty because it shows it from left to right, you know?
[12:20:45] <joikus> ah slidedown
[12:20:55] * smplstk nods
[12:26:02] <jammsen> anyone an idea why the browser dont show #hexcodes in color but in html color names? http://jsfiddle.net/5bvF2/27/
[12:27:22] <LabRaTT> change attr to css
[12:27:32] <guy>  $(this).find('td').attr('style', 'background-color: #3366CC;');
[12:27:33] <guy> wtf.
[12:28:08] <jammsen> LabRaTT: i tried this too, doenst work :(
[12:28:20] <smplstk> well, you need to change the params too.
[12:28:25] <LabRaTT> what are you tryingto do a mouse over of red
[12:28:42] <jammsen> LabRaTT: look this http://jsfiddle.net/5bvF2/28/
[12:28:49] <jiggliemon> $(this).find('td').css('background-color', '#3366CC');
[12:28:51] <jammsen> now is with .css
[12:29:10] <jammsen> the red is a example from the jquery site
[12:29:14] <jammsen> just to testing
[12:29:22] <jammsen> but it wont change in hex
[12:29:25] <LabRaTT> ok but what are you trying to do
[12:29:26] <jammsen> just html color names
[12:29:30] <LabRaTT> ok
[12:29:41] <jammsen> highlight a tr row at onmouseover
[12:29:51] <LabRaTT> so when i hover over you want the text color to change
[12:30:00] <jammsen> with highlight i mean change bg color auf tr
[12:30:12] <jammsen> -auf +of
[12:30:20] <jammsen> LabRaTT: thats right

[12:33:18] <LabRaTT> jammsen
[12:33:22] <LabRaTT> there you go
[12:34:08] <jammsen> so i cant use mouseenter event right?
[12:34:26] <LabRaTT> you don't need to... you can use live if you want
[12:34:40] <supsup> what if i'm anti-live
[12:34:45] <jammsen> .live does what?
[12:34:56] <LabRaTT> sorry that does not work

[12:53:24] <devc> I asked in CSS but figured I'd ask here too just in case there's a JS/jQuery solution... Anyone have experience using sprites as the src of <img> tags? I need to set the height to 1/5 the sprites height and overflow:hiddenl the part not showing, but of course that scales the image.

[13:04:45] <Agamemnus> wtfook
[13:04:53] <Agamemnus> what are we supposed to use then?
[13:05:27] <Agamemnus> seriously, any ideas?

[13:08:23] <albertosh> hmm i couldnt save but
[13:08:26] <albertosh> change the function to
[13:08:30] <lduros> not sure if this is me or jquery (it usually tends to be me). I have a code element created as such var code = $("<code/>"); I have some js code i Want to show, and I do: code.text(myJs); but then the code element text is still empty. on the other hand, if I do var code = "<code>" + myJs + "</code>"; I can see the code in there. Are there cases where text('') isn't assigned what it's given?
[13:08:39] <albertosh> $("#googleImg"(.removeAttr("src")
[13:08:51] <albertosh> and run that (Well written )
[13:09:08] <lduros> when i say there's some js I want to show, it's just a string of course, not js interpreted
[13:09:09] <lduros> :-)
[13:09:17] <supsup> so you want to set it to a 404?
[13:12:22] <supsup> i don't think u can do that ~~
[13:13:13] <supsup> you could just hide it tho
[13:13:16] <supsup> once u remove the src
[13:13:35] <supsup> would be same effect no?
[13:19:59] <ProLoser|Work> is it possible to monitor the change of the src of an iframe? specifically, if hashes are changed?
[13:28:16] <ProLoser|Work> what is the alternative to $().attr()
[13:28:22] <ProLoser|Work> isn't there like a property method or something?
[13:29:00] <eddiemonge> ?prop @ ProLoser|Work
[13:29:01] <bot-t> ProLoser|Work, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[13:29:12] <eddiemonge> but its not an alternative so to speak but a different case
[13:31:44] <ProLoser|Work>  hmm
[13:31:50] <supsup> there is some plugin
[13:31:50] <ProLoser|Work> i want to resize an iframe
[13:31:52] <supsup> for hashchange
[13:31:58] <ProLoser|Work> of an iframe?
[13:32:25] <supsup> i'd assume if the script is in the iframe
[13:32:26] <supsup> yes
[13:32:30] <ProLoser|Work> no
[13:32:38] <ProLoser|Work> i want the parent to monitor hash changes of an iframe
[13:32:45] <ProLoser|Work> i want to resize an iframe based on the hash
[13:33:05] <ProLoser|Work> i can't seem to get a demo to work however, i'm not sure the src property changes when changing the hash of the iframe
[13:33:17] <supsup> you could have the child send the parent a mesg
[13:33:19] <b1lly> i have an event listener within a function, but it seems like the event listener "ques" up everytime the function is called--> so when the event gets executed it triggers the function within it 10 times (or as many times as the parent function executed)
[13:33:27] <ProLoser|Work> supsup: it's cross domain
[13:33:30] <ProLoser|Work> how do i do that?
[13:33:48] <supsup> u would have to have them setup a page on their site to talk in between
[13:33:56] <supsup> ALex Sexton has a video on vimo that goes over it
[13:34:20] <supsup> that of course assumes u know the other domain and their willing to set that up for u
[13:34:50] <ProLoser|Work> what about easyxdm
[13:35:14] <supsup> no ideaz about that
[13:35:42] <supsup> i've only ever done cross domain the crazy ways
[13:35:49] <ProLoser|Work> crazy ways?
[13:36:02] <supsup> what i was talkin about before
[13:36:09] <devc> $(this).height(); returns 0, but when I look at $(this) with Chrome, the width and height are showing real numbers... I'm calling it within the image's $(this).load(function() { }); after appending it.
[13:37:19] <eddiemonge> devc: thats a lot of this
[13:37:34] <supsup> ProLoser: perhaps http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-hashchange/docs/files/jquery-ba-hashchange-js.html
[13:37:44] <supsup> jQuery.fn.hashchange.src     If, for some reason, you need to specify an Iframe src file (for example, when setting document.domain as in jQuery.fn.hashchange.domain), you can do so using this property.
[13:44:22] <b1lly> is there a way to destroy an event listener
[13:44:44] <ProLoser|Work> supsup: that doesn't make any sense to me
[13:44:49] <ProLoser|Work> how do i use it with an iframe?
[13:44:51] <eddiemonge> ?unbind @ b1lly
[13:44:52] <bot-t> b1lly, .unbind([eventType], [handler]): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[13:44:56] <ProLoser|Work> $(iframe).hashchange ??

[13:46:43] <ProLoser|Work> to do what?

[13:47:12] <ProLoser|Work> lol full sentences are helpful
[13:47:18] <ProLoser|Work> not a mind reader
[13:47:24] <ProLoser|Work> did you try .showing?
[13:47:41] <ProLoser|Work> and i don't get text-text
[13:48:01] <james13433_> text=" + text + "
[13:48:11] <ProLoser|Work> what's wrong with what you have?
[13:48:11] <james13433_> a made up attribute
[13:48:34] <ProLoser|Work> full sentences
[13:48:37] <ProLoser|Work> again
[13:48:55] <james13433_> its needs to get only the ones with the class of showing
[13:49:01] <ProLoser|Work> .showing
[13:49:17] <james13433_> ('label[for="options_20_2"].showing') right?
[13:49:23] <ProLoser|Work> sure

[14:12:51] <blognewb> hi guys has anyone here used fullcalendar?
[14:13:14] <ccmonster> hey, in a $.ajax call, how do i see what hte full url was, along with data:...
[14:15:23] <supsup> use firebug or chrome dev tools
[14:15:37] <supsup> if post view h eader
[14:15:42] <supsup> if get view url params
[14:16:17] <supsup> I have used fullCalendar
[14:17:05] <context> is it possible to do something like this:
[14:17:06] <context>   $('[data-replicant=container]').delegate('[data-replicant=record]:last [data-replicant=activator]', 'change keyup', function(ev) {
[14:17:16] <context> trying to move the code from live() but its not working at all
[14:17:57] <supsup> never tried that
[14:18:06] <context> jq 1.6.4, no errors or anything. even if i remove the [data-replicant=record]:last
[14:18:08] <supsup> your delegating changes inside  a tag instead of seperate elements?
[14:18:18] <abourget> I recall having tried a functionality (that I thought was called deferred binding) that was a mix between bind() and live() .. that attached to a high-level node in the DOM, and could affect childrens even if they weren't there at load time..
[14:18:24] <abourget> Does anyone know what I'm talking about ?
[14:18:35] <context> supsup: this replicates lines in a table. but i only want to it take affect when the last line is touched
[14:19:06] <supsup> not sure what u mean why would u not used the ID of the table or something?  and have it trigger when row classes appear
[14:19:38] <supsup> assuming <tr class="x"> get added via ajax or something
[14:19:38] <context> eh? cause this is generic used in multiple places all over the site with different tables
[14:20:00] <context> no the new record gets added when this delegate gets called
[14:20:27] <supsup> yah not used to those selectors ~~
[14:20:49] <context> [] is just for any selector that isnt id or class
[14:20:57] <context> input[name=whatever]
[14:21:06] <context> the selector works perfectly fine with live()
[14:21:07] <supsup> yah but i don't know context of what your adding it to etc.
[14:21:15] <context> what ?
[14:21:20] <abourget> FOUND IT !  it was 'delegate' thanks everyone :)
[14:21:41] <supsup> i thought u were joking abouget since that's what context was talkign about.
[14:21:46] <context> haha
[14:22:10] <context> the parent is [data-replicant=container]
[14:22:21] <context> i dont care what kind of tag it is itself
[14:22:22] <supsup> so u have trs that have data-replicant = 'x' on them?
[14:22:29] <context> it doesn't have to be tr
[14:22:37] <supsup> i'm just curious what ur putting in on
[14:22:42] <context> $('[data-replicant=record]') gets my stuff perfectly fine
[14:23:03] <context> in this case its .. <tr data-replicant="record">
[14:23:18] <context> not x... its whatever is in the selector
[14:23:33] <supsup> i ment x to rep as a var
[14:23:37] <supsup> meaning it could mean anything
[14:23:44] <context> sure ?
[14:24:12] <supsup> so if you do your full selector it works ?  like in console
[14:24:15] <supsup> after ur stuff loads?
[14:24:34] <supsup> i.e., $('[data-replicant=record]:last [data-replicant=activator]')
[14:24:54] <supsup> or is it just empty
[14:24:59] <context> $('[data-replicant=container]').find('[data-replicant=record]:last [data-replicant=activator]')
[14:24:59] <supsup> if empty then thats your problem ;-0
[14:25:06] <context> finds my elements.
[14:25:25] <context> like i said, this WORKS with live()
[14:26:00] <supsup> i think it treats your selector tho as $('[data-replicant=record]:last [data-replicant=activator]') not as a find?
[14:26:14] <supsup> i don't know just started using delegate myself ~~
[14:26:42] <context> so what ? the delegate gets attached to the container
[14:26:47] <context> which is exactly where its suppose to be
[14:27:03] <context> if $('x y z') works $('y z') is going to work
[14:28:34] <blognewb> hey supsup i can't find a guide on how to utilize the eventDrop, so how do you pass the changes from ajax/jquery to php?
[14:28:54] <eddiemonge> blognewb: you mean like see ? post
[14:28:54] <bot-t> blognewb, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[14:30:57] <context> blognewb: you handle eventDrop in jquery. you 'communicate' with php the same way you always do. via sending a request to the server.
[14:31:09] <context> err, in js... you get the picture
[14:33:02] <blognewb> eddiemonge context oh wow, i forgot about that method... and is there a native function in jquery that could convert Thu Nov 03 2011 00:00:00 GMT -700 to just 11-03-2011?
[14:33:38] <context> not a single function.
[14:35:48] <danielss89> Hi.. is there function similar to slideDown, which instead slides up? Not hiding, but showing by sliding from bottom to top?
[14:36:12] <eddiemonge> blognewb: not jquery, but i think javascript ways
[14:36:25] <eddiemonge> danielss89: animate
[14:36:44] <necromancer> blognewb: look up the Date object on MDN
[14:37:20] <context> yeah, delegate doesnt work for shit
[14:41:01] <scar2> Can anyone direct me on how to possibly use these features of jquery such as the progress bar and slider? Basically I'm trying to figure out how to have jQuery update the progress bar, etc etc based on what im doing
[14:41:22] <eddiemonge> scar2: those are jQuery UI. see ? jqueryui
[14:41:23] <bot-t> scar2, UI - This is the official documentation for jQuery UI , jQuery's visual controls. jQuery UI features a wide range of core interaction plugins as well as many UI widgets . The project homepage is located... http://docs.jquery.com/Ui
[14:42:05] <context> scar2: http://jqueryui.com/demos/
[14:42:14] <context> you click what you want, and there are docs for each one
[14:42:48] <supsup> context:  fix this to be ur example....this simple case works fine:  http://jsfiddle.net/zK7Tg/
[14:43:23] <tommyent> I'm using slidedown and everything is working fine but I would like it to push the content on the page up instead of down is this possible
[14:45:38] <supsup> ? .slideUp
[14:45:38] <bot-t> .slideUp([duration], [callback]): Hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideUp/
[14:47:04] <eddiemonge> tommyent: use animate

[14:48:37] <tommyent> supsup: thanks. I'm a complete query noob
[14:49:03] <supsup> me2 i  just google what people ask.
[14:49:16] <eddiemonge> RedOrigin1: what is line 12 outputting?
[14:49:40] <CannedCorn> hey guys, can someone take a look at this code? http://jsfiddle.net/NWdxk/
[14:49:49] <CannedCorn> for some reason myLocation is always undefined
[14:50:05] <RedOrigin1> nothing, that was actually just a variable while I was being stupid
[14:50:20] <Eviltwin> CannedCorn: Learn about asynchronous programming
[14:50:38] <Eviltwin> Here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/uYeYN/
[14:50:39] <Eviltwin> I gotta go
[14:50:41] <eddiemonge> RedOrigin1: then parseJSON('') isnt going to do anything
[14:50:49] <RedOrigin1> sorry let me edit and repaste if you don't mind
[14:51:26] <scar2> context: yeah i saw that, but i dont see anything on the actual progress bar or slider on how to have it interact or whichever. also, a main question i have as well would be the icons. when u go here, www.airdorableballoons.com/jquery you'll see my themeroller demo sheet. i cant get the icon buttons at the bottom to show up how they do there
[14:51:35] <CannedCorn> Eviltwin i know about it
[14:51:36] <RedOrigin1> http://pastebin.com/gPkuuEJ1
[14:51:36] <GoSox> I'm trying to submit a form into a div, and it's actually working fine. But the div is empty before, so I want to use slideDown so that the data going into that div gets revealed with animation after it's loaded. How do I do this?
[14:51:41] <CannedCorn> this is in the context of a larger doc
[14:52:20] <scar2> like do i have to put them in ul/li ?
[14:52:43] <RedOrigin1> okay, this time it returns a null.
[14:52:47] <supsup> GoSox: you don't really submit a form into a div yo you submit it to the server or to some javascript to validate before sending it to the server.  so not sure whatyou mean
[14:53:03] <GoSox> yeah i think i just explained it wrong
[14:53:08] <GoSox> let me pastebin what i have
[14:53:16] <supsup> make example on jsfiddle ~
[14:53:24] <LakWork_> given the following example, my objective is to merge the data from a form with an object array so that i can submit them together. This is working well enough, but the serialization isn't behaving the way I'd like it to. I need my request parameters to look like VenueCycles[0].VID=1,VenueCycles[1].CID=1, etc but instead it's producing VenueCycles[0][VID]=1,VenueCycles[0][CID]=1, can anyone
[14:53:24] <LakWork_> offer some direction?   http://jsfiddle.net/s9EZq/2/
[14:55:38] <RedOrigin1> eddiemonge: I think it's because the json_encode() only encodes the values of the array.
[14:57:25] <danielss89> eddiemonge: to use animate, doesn't i need to know the height?
[14:57:34] <RedOrigin1> so I'm getting ["value","value"]
[14:57:52] <danielss89> i'm making a chat box, and what the elements to slide up from bottom, but depending on the amount of text, the height varies
[14:58:15] <GoSox> supsup: here's my code. It works perfect, I jsut don't know how to implement a slow slide-down into line 9
[14:58:16] <GoSox> http://pastebin.com/j1e6xY08
[14:58:25] <eddiemonge> RedOrigin1: i would say check your php to make sure it is outputting the correct json that you want to use
[14:58:33] <GoSox> #traceroute_result starts out hidden
[14:59:43] <eddiemonge> danielss89: try animating to height: auto, although sliding up is a weird case
[15:00:04] <danielss89> well like her on IRC the newest messages is at bottom
[15:00:17] <danielss89> but instead of just showing i want it to slideup
[15:00:57] <RedOrigin1> eddiemonge: thanks for trying to help me though, I've been trying to crack this for days now so I really appreciate any little bit you know?
[15:04:41] <eddiemonge> danielss89: thats different case
[15:05:15] <danielss89> eddiemonge: ok, know how i can do it? :D
[15:05:26] <eddiemonge> thats more of absolute positioning
[15:05:49] <eddiemonge> is your block going to have a set height or is your dom going to infinitely scroll?
[15:05:57] <danielss89> infinite scroll
[15:06:30] <danielss89> so at the same time i have to scroll down
[15:07:03] <danielss89> well, the #chatcontent box has a height of 410px
[15:07:14] <danielss89> and inside that should be scroll
[15:08:06] <eddiemonge> if you have infinite scroll, you may run into performance problems if you let it run for a long time because the DOM will have a lot of stuff in it

[15:13:35] <Dr4g> Building a jquery plugin I'd like to instantiate it on page load; however once the user performs some actions i want to apply the same plugin to a new set of DOM elements, making the first instantiation redundant.
[15:13:37] <Dr4g> Can someone advise ?
[15:14:07] <context> ok. now even live() is missing me off
[15:15:24] <Kage> I am looking into platform options for a new game I am making, and HTML5/jQuery/GameQuery looks intresting... but this game is planned to be a multiplayer aspect and would like to know how well ajax will hold up in a real time multiplayer game, or if there is a better option.
[15:15:46] <danielss89> Kage: see ? nodejs
[15:15:47] <bot-t> Kage, Tips for jQuery Bug Patching - There are some assumptions made here, one being that you are set up with some form of "localhost" http server and that it's running. http://docs.jquery.com/Tips_for_jQuery_Bug_Patching
[15:15:53] <danielss89> ok wrong :D
[15:15:55] <danielss89> hehe
[15:16:01] <danielss89> Kage: Check out node.ks
[15:16:05] <danielss89> node.js even
[15:16:40] <Dr4g> Kage: node.js will suffice; you could also try ZeroMQ, which is an event loop handler.
[15:17:01] <Kage> danielss89: well... I don't plan doing the server in Javascript...
[15:17:23] <Dr4g> Kage: why not? the JS is just a scriting language like PHP or Perl
[15:17:23] <danielss89> then lookup ajax long polling
[15:17:46] <Kage> Dr4g: errrr... I was thinking more of C++ >.>
[15:18:03] <Kage> for the server
[15:18:06] <Dr4g> Kage: each client setting a message into the "event loop" and the chat window polls for updates, and the server will obtain those for your requesting chat client and display them respectively.
[15:18:08] <Kage> and just the client in Javascript
[15:18:22] <eddiemonge> Dr4g: have you looked at see ? delegate
[15:18:22] <bot-t> Dr4g, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[15:18:33] <Dr4g> Kage: you don't need C++ in the server; a simple PHP app connecting to an event manager engine (like zeromq, or gearman) is what you wnat.
[15:18:57] <Dr4g> eddiemonge: i'm familiar with delegate; i'm not sure how it can help me with my plugin question; can you point out something specfici ?
[15:19:18] <supsup> LakWork from $.param api page:  Because some frameworks have limited ability to parse serialized arrays, developers should exercise caution when passing an obj argument that contains objects or arrays nested within another array.
[15:19:18] <Kage> Dr4g: errrr.... well I am more familiar with working with sockets and such
[15:19:20] <danielss89> Kage Look at node.js and socket.io it will use web sockets if available, or flash web sockets or long polling. It finds out what is best and is supported by the browser
[15:20:00] <Kage> danielss89: I see...
[15:20:34] <supsup> also LakWork:  Because there is no universally agreed-upon specification for param strings, it is not possible to encode complex data structures using this method in a manner that works ideally across all languages supporting such input. Until such time that there is, the $.param method will remain in its current form.
[15:21:18] <Kage> well the whole point of using HTML5/Javascript is portability... if its going to require people to download things to run it, I might as well do a stright up C++ client as well
[15:21:39] <Dr4g> Kage: why is there downloading required ?
[15:21:45] <Dr4g> It's a web-based chat client
[15:22:01] <supsup> i did not know that was the main point of Javascript i thought it was to be badass.
[15:22:29] <Kage> Its not just web-based chat client, I need to send other game data like locations of monsters and other players
[15:22:50] <Dr4g> Kage: alright;
[15:23:01] <Kage> nodejs looks like it requires executables
[15:23:10] <Dr4g> Kage: it uses V8
[15:23:13] <supsup> nope
[15:23:58] <supsup> Kage check this out: http://blip.tv/jsconf/jsconf2011-mario-gonzalez-5477994
[15:24:11] <queuetip> stupid question, # is for id and . is for class?
[15:24:17] <supsup> word
[15:24:20] <queuetip> you'd be surpised how difficult that is to google
[15:24:22] <supsup> or # is for hash in the url too
[15:24:50] <supsup> #myId = 1 per page.  .myclass = x per page where x is up to your imagination
[15:24:55] <queuetip> i mean for the jquery style short cuts, e.g. $("#for_id") and $(".for_class")
[15:25:06] <supsup> well those are selectors
[15:25:06] <queuetip> supsup: yeah i know that much i just don't know jquery very well : D
[15:25:11] <supsup> which u can do a lot with not just css
[15:25:42] <queuetip> supsup: well thanks, you answered my question :P
[15:25:51] <supsup> yah np
[15:27:47] <devc> I'm losing scope of something and I can't figure out where... http://clients.jpgninja.com/kidzsmart.com/book02/index02.html on line 57 of script02.js I'm trying to find all children with a class of 'loading' and it always comes back empty.
[15:28:20] <Dr4g> var arrayOfChildren = $(elem).find('.loading');
[15:28:44] <Dr4g> arrayOfChildren.each(function() {  .. stuff here for each child  });
[15:29:00] <devc> That's essentially what I'm doing.
[15:29:10] <LakWork_> children.push()
[15:29:13] <LakWork_> children.shove()
[15:29:19] <queuetip> in jquery, .post only posts to it and gives back response data, but is there a way to post to a page in the way a form action would so that it actually goes to that page and doesn't stay where it is? does that make sense?
[15:29:22] <devc> except I don't want to do something with each, I am checking against length which is always 0
[15:29:38] <LakWork_> queuetip you want a non ajax post
[15:29:46] <LakWork_> right?
[15:29:49] <queuetip> LakWork_: is that something I use jquery for? and yes
[15:29:58] <LakWork_> you don't need jquery for it
[15:30:05] <LakWork_> that's just standard html :]
[15:30:23] <queuetip> LakWork_: well, i need a regular link though to post a variable to an existing page
[15:30:34] <queuetip> LakWork_: it's not a button and there's no form
[15:30:49] <LakWork_> well then
[15:31:15] <LakWork_> you could make a form in memory, add the necessary fields, and call submit on it
[15:31:29] <queuetip> LakWork_: good point, I'll do that :P
[15:31:33] <queuetip> LakWork_: thanks
[15:31:44] <LakWork_> $('<form action="/posturl.php" method="post" />').append(....).submit()
[15:32:06] <queuetip> LakWork_: can I actually do exact that?
[15:32:11] <LakWork_> yup!
[15:32:23] <queuetip> LakWork_: excuse my language, but that is fucking AWESOME
[15:32:26] <LakWork_> you may need to append the form to the page before you call submit(). older browsers wont handle the submit if the form isnt actually an element on the page
[15:32:43] <queuetip> LakWork_: gotcha, np
[15:33:23] <queuetip> LakWork_: where do i put the variables i'm posting though in that style?
[15:33:39] <LakWork_> well
[15:33:52] <LakWork_> you could make them into hidden fields and append them
[15:33:55] <devc> Once my var stillLoading = chr.find('img.loading'); comes back empty, the script assumes that everything's been loaded and loads the page, but then the other elements fire when they're done loading and the function doubles up on itself.
[15:34:05] <queuetip> LakWork_: $('<form method="post" /><input type='hidden' />').append(...).subumit() ?
[15:34:27] <queuetip> LakWork_: or would i first have to append the form to body, then append the hidden fields to form?
[15:34:59] <LakWork_> that might not work exactly, i'm not sure if the return jquery element from the initial selector will be the form, you could do: $('<form ... />').append('<input type="hidden" ... />').submit()
[15:35:26] <queuetip> LakWork_: excellent, that's enough for me to make it work (hopefully / eventually) :D thanks a bunch
[15:35:43] <LakWork_> np
[15:36:00] <LakWork_> some of my code i wrote a couple of days ago:
[15:36:02] <LakWork_>                     jQuery('<form action="' + url + '" method="post">').append(selectedEvents).submit();
[15:36:17] <LakWork_> that didnt paste exactly how it was supposed to >.>
[15:36:32] <LakWork_> // This isn't madness, THIS IS SPARTA!（╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
[15:36:33] <LakWork_>                     jQuery('<form action="' + url + '" method="post">').append(selectedEvents).submit();
[15:38:12] <CannedCorn> are things you define inside $(document).ready(){things} available inside other jquery components. I'm trying to access them from inside autocomplete code and they appear undefined.
[15:38:55] <LakWork_> $(document).ready() is a closure, thus any variables defined inside of it would be local to that closure unless first initialized outside the closure
[15:39:13] <Kage> supsup: wow that is nice
[15:39:24] <LakWork_> i.e. you could do var foo = 'asdlgjkadgkjadg' $(document).ready(function() { foo = 'adsoglkadgadgladkg'; });
[15:40:56] <LakWork_> @ CannedCorn
[15:43:26] <tktiddle> Hi im trying to use a function that uses $  i.e " function blah(){$('div')} "  but Im trying to call it from an envrionment where $ has not been defined, its called django.jQuery instead.
[15:43:40] <Dr4g> tktiddle: do this..
[15:44:04] <tolland> is there anything like gwt for jquery?
[15:44:09] <devc> Anyone wanna take a stab at why that array's coming back empty? I've been staring at it for hours and I cann't figure out for the life of me what's going on. I need a new set of eyeballs on it.
[15:44:12] <Dr4g> django.jQuery.ready(function($)) { .. now $ here is jquery ... });
[15:44:15] <Dr4g> tktiddle: ^
[15:44:36] <Dr4g> the $ symbol is localised as .ready() passes jQuery object into its callabck
[15:44:38] <Dr4g> callback *
[15:44:48] <Dr4g> devc: sure; jsfiddle it for us.
[15:45:03] <Dr4g> and you can ping me (say my name) when ur ready
[15:45:20] <devc> Dr4g: Does the example I provided not work well enough?
[15:45:36] <apollo13> tktiddle: django's approach has some drawbacks, my apps usually override the admin jquery.init.js so django doesn't configure it with insaneNoConflict
[15:45:47] <tktiddle> Dr4g: but what about this ? "function blah(){$('div')} ; django.jQuery.ready(function($)) { blah();})"
[15:45:52] <devc> I can jsfiddle it if not, just wanted to make sure that you'd looked and seen something that makes it unworkable there.
[15:46:05] <Dr4g> tktiddle: i recommend you jsfiddle or pastebin your code example; thanks.
[15:46:14] <Dr4g> devc: i didn't see an example; apologes
[15:46:25] <devc> Dr4g: http://clients.jpgninja.com/kidzsmart.com/book02/index02.html
[15:46:38] <devc> Try that. The problem's occuring on line 57 of script02.js
[15:47:13] <CannedCorn> thanks LakWork_
[15:47:29] <Dr4g> devc: in page load i get no console errors;
[15:47:36] <devc> I'm trying to grab any children with 'loading' classes. But it's coming back empty. At first I thought it might be in the DOM not being set up but everything's triggered from Jquery's .ready
[15:48:00] <Dr4g> devc: i need a stack trace to follow
[15:48:04] <devc> so as far as I know it's something deeper.
[15:48:06] <Dr4g> what is calling this function ?
[15:48:45] <spongecake> Hello all! :) Anyone know how to reload an XML file? I'm using the .get()
[15:49:30] <devc> initPage() grabs all ".character" items, then .each() through's them with preloadCharacter(); --> Preload loads a body graphic and an eye sprite, and then calls "isLoaded" (line 126)
[15:49:39] <devc> Dr4g: ^^
[15:50:21] <tktiddle> Dr4g: http://jsfiddle.net/amsW5/
[15:50:37] <supsup> spongecake add a random number to the end of your get so it don't cache it.
[15:50:50] <supsup> .xml?myrand=1241242
[15:50:55] <Dr4g> devc: i'm struggling to follow your stuff; i need a replicatable HTML structure in a jsfiddle environment.
[15:51:04] <devc> okay.
[15:51:18] <Dr4g> devc: explaining code to me is useless; showing me lines of code is the way to go
[15:51:48] <Dr4g> tktiddle: i see your fiddle; how is this replicating your problem ?
[15:51:59] <supsup> Dr4g my code is so tight tho it's black font right and 14.5 line height 4 space tabs and shit
[15:52:01] <devc> Dr4g: I'll JSfiddle it. Line 126 calls the code on line 57 which comes back empty. I can't specify any sharper than that.
[15:52:02] <spongecake> supsup where do I add that? I'm calling a function in the $.get() which parses the XML into HTML
[15:52:50] <Dr4g> devc: so does line 61
[15:52:50] <supsup> first param of get is a url right
[15:53:18] <Dr4g> supsup: did you accidently say my name ?
[15:53:26] <spongecake> supsup yeah. Then after that I have the function to parse XML - all inside the $.get() method
[15:53:29] <supsup> naw, i was trying to describe my code to u
[15:53:45] <Dr4g> supsup: theres no point to that; jsfiddle an example for me to debug however is useful.
[15:53:52] <supsup> so like after u got your url, add a random number to the end
[15:53:52] <spongecake> supsup oh okay. sorry :P
[15:53:55] <devc> Dr4g: yeah when the characters aren't loaded, it checks back until they are.
[15:53:55] <supsup> it was a joke yo
[15:55:12] <tktiddle> apollo13: So whats the way to override this noconflict?
[15:55:38] <Dr4g> tktiddle: noConflict() however the example i gave you by localising the $ char is the way to go here.
[15:55:46] <spongecake> supsup so it'd be $.get(URL, RANDOM No. , function...  ?

[15:55:48] <bot-t> Hopsy, A Meta-reflective Wiki for Collaborative Design - http://wikisym.org/ws2011/_media/proceedings:p53-zhu.pdf
[15:55:51] <Dr4g> django.ready(function($)) { ... my jquery code here ... });
[15:55:53] <Dr4g> tktiddle: ^
[15:55:55] <supsup> no
[15:56:08] <jac0bz1> Can jQuery/javascript make up for percent handling in browsers??
[15:56:16] <jac0bz1> http://jsbin.com/axucin <- IE handles percent fine (shock!), firefox almost got it, chrome/safari are close and opera is WAY of
[15:56:35] <apollo13> tktiddle: like you do with templates, just make the file a noop (more or less, copy a reference of jquery to django.jquery …)
[15:56:55] <Dr4g> devc: i see your code but the indentation is way off hard to follow and it looks like you have a function inside a function which is tricky.
[15:57:11] <supsup> spongecake:  http://jsfiddle.net/EM5vY/
[15:57:12] <Dr4g> with regard to looking up dom elements, i'm not sure it's not ready to debug remotely.
[15:57:30] <supsup> also i think u can juse use $.ajax instead and make the type Post those don't get cached by IE
[15:58:09] <Hopsy> ?w p53
[15:58:10] <bot-t> Hopsy, P53 - p53 (also known as protein 53 or tumor protein 53), is a tumor suppressor protein that in humans is encoded by the TP53 gene. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53
[15:58:44] <Dr4g> devc: line #10 is where things start; i recommend spitting out $(this) object in your line #10 .each() loop and using a DOM inspection tool to see if there are img.loading instances available; and remember "img.loading" is different from "img .loading"
[15:58:45] <Dr4g> good luck :)
[15:59:39] <devc> Dr4g: I'm passing you a JSFiddle... But you can see from console that the images do indeed have .loading classes, and the JS still returns empty.
[15:59:43] <spongecake> supsup ohh I see. I'll give that a go. Thanks a lot! :)
[15:59:52] <devc> Dr4g: http://jsfiddle.net/FaLQJ/
[16:00:15] <Dr4g> devc: I don't see a .loading class by the way
[16:00:24] <Dr4g> i dumped out $('.characters') and looked at their <img> tags
[16:00:31] <tktiddle> Thanks Dr4g
[16:00:32] <Dr4g> they have a class of "eyes" and that's it
[16:00:33] <supsup> spongecake u don't have to use such a high # 1 is actually fine
[16:01:11] <Dr4g> devc: also: $('.character .loading'); returns an empty array
[16:01:18] <devc> Dr4g: If you look while it loads, with break-points, it has loading classes. The loading classes get removed as soon as the images load.
[16:01:33] <devc> so since your images exist in your cache, they get removed quickly.
[16:01:43] <devc> .. hmm maybe that's the issue
[16:01:44] <devc> HAHA
[16:01:47] <Dr4g> devc: ;)
[16:02:26] <Dr4g> devc: i'm not sure why you need .loading and not just let the images load normally ? :P
[16:02:52] <spongecake> supsup something like this? - http://jsfiddle.net/AkZBa/
[16:03:29] <devc> Dr4g: Because I need the images preloaded. It's not a webpage I'm working on, but an app/framework.
[16:04:32] <GoSox> I want to load a.php into a div in b.php. But a.php is slow and takes a few seconds. So how can I load it "invisibly" and then reveal it once it's done loading?
[16:04:35] <GoSox> know what i mean?
[16:04:44] <supsup> spongecake do it outside the get but yah.
[16:04:50] <supsup> build up your URL before you send it to get
[16:04:51] <supsup> imo
[16:05:21] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/AkZBa/1/
[16:05:55] <supsup> i don't ever use $.get or $.post i just use $.ajax
[16:06:03] <spongecake> supsup ahh right. I think I'm with you now. So declare the URL in a var, then refer to that in the .get() ?
[16:06:45] <binni> I have three divs with lots of images, I hide two at a time, how can I halt the downloading of images in the two hiding divs when showing just one?
[16:06:58] <supsup> pass it get yah
[16:07:23] <supsup> all of this should be in some other function so you don't pollute global scope
[16:07:43] <supsup> like u don't want window.myurl etc
[16:08:53] <Dr4g> devc: to preload; you can use 'new Image()' and set the src yourself in there.
[16:09:03] <Dr4g> an then apply the object into the DOM element.
[16:09:04] <devc> hah that's what I doooooo
[16:09:08] <spongecake> supsup yeah. I'm with you now! :) Hokey cokey. I'll crack on with that.
[16:09:11] <Dr4g> devc: ;-) ok
[16:09:15] <supsup> u can do this too spongecake http://jsfiddle.net/AkZBa/2/
[16:10:18] <Dr4g> devc: maybe you should walk away from the computer and take a shower
[16:10:28] <Dr4g> thinking about code in the shower is always a good technique
[16:10:33] <devc> Dr4g: Never have truer words been spoken. I'm off work in ten minutes
[16:10:41] <supsup> i only think about deer hunting in the shower
[16:10:48] <supsup> just sayin
[16:10:48] <devc> but I've been struggling with this for hours.
[16:10:48] <spongecake> supsup ahh! This is looking more like what I need! :D
[16:13:03] <spongecake> supsup My function is big. Would it still work to use: var myfunct = blah();   --- then ---- function blah(){};
[16:16:16] <supsup> huh
[16:16:34] <supsup> do it how i have in example
[16:17:41] <spongecake> supsup like this: http://jsfiddle.net/AkZBa/3/
[16:19:12] <spongecake> supsup okay. Thanks a lot for your help! I've been trying to sort this out all day xD
[16:19:29] <jac0bz1> I'm asking again, anyone know of a solution to percent handling in browsers? http://jsbin.com/axucin (IE handles percent fine (shock!), firefox almost got it, chrome/safari are close and opera is WAY of)
[16:22:39] <amites> Any ideas why this function doesn't show/hide the div? http://jsfiddle.net/ZQFZs/1/
[16:24:24] <supsup> spongecake just make the function anonymous
[16:24:27] <supsup> and assign it to your var
[16:24:46] <joikus> you guys how can I force the bottom blue bar, to be all the way at the bottom of the screen without a scrollbar?
[16:24:51] <joikus> on all screen resolutions
[16:24:57] <joikus> http://tradegoodz.inlinefx.com/  blue bottom bar
[16:25:09] <joikus> looks fine on my 11.6 laptop, but horrible no the 23 inch
[16:25:11] <ch3mical> Hello
[16:26:59] <jac0bz1> joikus: postion: absolute
[16:27:19] <jac0bz1> *position
[16:27:52] <joikus> but what value
[16:28:01] <jac0bz1> huh?
[16:28:17] <joikus> you want me to use absolute and top ?
[16:28:41] <spongecake> supsup hokey cokey :)
[16:28:44] <jac0bz1> set the bottom div to position: absolute; bottom: 0; then set the body to position: relative; and html,body to have 100% height
[16:28:58] <joikus> ok let me try
[16:29:29] <jac0bz1> remember to add padding-bottom to the content area to match your footer
[16:29:57] <jac0bz1> go to the css channel if you need more help
[16:32:00] <Myra> jqueery
[16:33:34] <joikus> ok
[16:39:40] <joikus> jac0bz1, ok your suggestion worked
[16:39:44] <joikus> now i have a jqueyr issue
[16:40:25] <joikus> when I click the bottom footter, I try to scroll it upwards
[16:40:29] <joikus> $('html,body').animate({ scrollTop: $('#bottomSection').offset().top }, 750..
[16:40:45] <joikus> but it's all broken now, the animation does not work well with teh absolute
[16:41:17] <jac0bz1> the footer or the page?
[16:42:15] <joikus> the bottom blue footer: http://tradegoodz.inlinefx.com/
[16:42:20] <joikus> if you refresh and click you will see what it does
[16:42:25] <joikus> it used to slide all the way up
[16:42:36] <joikus> no it's all weird due to absolute pos
[16:43:27] <jac0bz1> do you slide the footer to the top?
[16:43:46] <joikus> yup
[16:43:49] <joikus> thats the idea
[16:43:55] <joikus> and show the hidden div below it
[16:44:23] <jac0bz1> why dont just slide the hidden div up?
[16:44:39] <joikus> http://pastebin.com/1dCJgSaH
[16:44:44] <joikus> this is the jquery when you click the bottom
[16:44:49] <joikus> it's still work in progress
[16:45:30] <joikus> line 16 behaves weird when you click
[16:46:13] <jac0bz1> i can see that..
[16:46:47] <joikus> without the position:absolute, it would scroll up properly
[16:47:02] <joikus> but.. it would not be placed at the bottom.. without it
[16:47:09] <joikus> oh boy
[16:48:46] <joikus> ok i improved it
[16:48:59] <joikus> by putting the hidden div below that blue bar, inside that blue bar's div
[16:51:46] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky ooogabooogabooooga
[16:51:47] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[16:51:55] <hooloovoo> ?botsnack
[16:51:55] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[16:52:38] <joikus> the problem is
[16:52:39] <joikus> $('#bottomSection').offset().top
[16:52:47] <joikus> this value is different on my 2 different screens
[16:53:47] <jac0bz1> joikus: Sry mate.. don't have time to debug for you right now :( I got work in 6 hours so i gotta go to bed
[16:53:49] <jac0bz1> sorry

[16:58:49] <ProLoser|Work> how can i use hash change to monitor an iframe?
[17:00:57] <Zxurian> is there a jquery logic statment that can test whether s elect element is open or not?
[17:01:08] <Zxurian> [wether a select]
[17:01:27] <coldhead> i don't think so, Zxurian
[17:01:56] <Zxurian> bah
[17:04:36] <Zxurian> okay, maybe i'll ask the parent question then. I have a form which has a .keyup check for enter, and submits the form when enter is hit, but when the select dropdown is opened, and someone hits [enter] to select an item, the form correspondingly submits
[17:04:47] <Zxurian> any ideas for workarounds since I can't test to see whether the select element is open?
[17:08:50] <zackattack> What's the best UX for uploading a CSV and then displaying it in table format?
[17:10:14] <karega|aniasis> animating the background positions is possible in jQuery core yet?

[17:14:29] <suncica2222> what is $. in $.getScript()?
[17:14:46] <suncica2222> what it means?
[17:15:59] <ryanseddon> ok suncica2222 looks like you need some beginner info http://jqfundamentals.com/
[17:16:26] <ajpiano> Zxurian: why don't you not have a keyup check for enter, and instead use the fact that enter *will* submit the form in the right circumstances
[17:17:04] <ajpiano> Zxurian: and barring that, just check the target of the event in the handler and see if it was the select box
[17:19:13] <Zxurian_> sorry, disconnected
[17:19:36] <Zxurian_> http://jsfiddle.net/VSHGA/5/ - that is your updated fiddle, the problem is that the form is submitting when the select dropdown is open and someone is hitting enter just to select an element
[17:19:55] <thetrav> I'm looking at a page that shows use of $(...) which I haven't seen before, also I get errors when I try to use it
[17:20:07] <thetrav> is $(...) supposed to be a real thing?
[17:20:11] <Zxurian_> select dropdown selection should be a separate event from form submission, but I can't see a way to disassociate between the two
[17:20:31] <Jon47> thetrav, $ is just a variable (which is also a function)
[17:20:51] <Jon47> in the javascript world, it's become a convention for frameworks to use this variable in the global namespace
[17:21:04] <suncica2222> I know javascript, I dont know jQuery, what do $.  and $ and # mean?
[17:21:32] <thetrav> I understand the $ object
[17:21:38] <danzik17> Zxurian_: that's in no way the same as my original fiddle
[17:21:40] <thetrav> but not ... as a parameter
[17:22:00] <suncica2222> is $. function call?
[17:22:01] <Zxurian_> danzik: no, its updated to reflect the question I originally asked, which your original fiddle didn't associate with
[17:22:36] <ajpiano> Zxurian_: http://ajpiano.com/cap/32517f.png
[17:23:01] <ajpiano> suncica2222: jQuery is a function - in javascript, functions can have properties and methods
[17:23:14] <ajpiano> so jQuery.getScript is a static method of window.jQuery
[17:23:42] <thetrav> I have a suspicion the site is just trying to say "some stuff goes here but I'm not telling you what"
[17:23:46] <joikus> struggling with this scrollTop when you click on the bottom blue bar: http://tradegoodz.inlinefx.com/
[17:24:05] <joikus> it wont scroll all the way up, and on different monitors, it scrolls different heights
[17:24:17] <Zxurian_> ajp: thanks, disconnected so didn't see that. I thought about that method and single out select elements, but then enter wouldn't submit the form when the select element has the focus
[17:24:39] <ajpiano> Zxurian_: users like forms that behave like all the other forms they are used to
[17:24:48] <joikus> im seriously going to paypal someone $20 for that 1 line of jquery/css to get this to scroll all the way up on all screens
[17:24:51] <joikus> I simply dont get it
[17:24:52] <ajpiano> you aren't doing anyone any favours by like helping the enter key magically work in some edge cases
[17:24:54] <ajpiano> IMO
[17:26:00] <Zxurian_> ajpiano: didn't even occur to me that that's how default forms works, just tried it on three public sites
[17:26:16] <ajpiano> exactly
[17:26:29] <ajpiano> this wheel is already a wheel
[17:27:01] <Zxurian_> seems counter-intuitive to me, but oh well. I adapt to please the masses.
[17:29:22] <joikus> ok it's because the bottom blue bar is position:absolute, but not sure how to fix
[17:29:43] <joikus> wonder if i can change the position:position and remove it via js
[17:32:04] <danzik17> Zxurian_: this does what you were asking about, far as i can tell : http://jsfiddle.net/VSHGA/8/
[17:34:06] <karega|aniasis> the right of an element can be calculated as (el.left + el.width) correct?
[17:42:16] <Axsuul> how would i pass an argument into the callback function for something like .slideDown('slow', callback)
[17:42:40] <Axsuul> because... .slideDown('slow', function(arg1, arg2) { ... }); doesn't seem to work
[17:42:43] <ajpiano> .slideDown("slow", function() { callback("something"); });
[17:43:01] <Axsuul> so its gotte be a closure?
[17:43:03] <Axsuul> gotta*
[17:43:51] <danzik17> Axsuul: the second argument in bind is "eventData: A map of data that will be passed to the event handler."
[17:43:55] <danzik17> or use a closure

[17:52:04] <coldhead> i'm a cyberpunk
[17:52:45] <PrgmrBill> I'm a cool breeze on an autumn day.
[17:53:04] <coldhead> billy idol has released more albums about me than you then
[17:53:22] <PrgmrBill> I think I can live with that
[17:53:48] <coldhead> you'll have to, i'm sorry
[17:54:23] <karega|aniasis> if you are binding say 100 elements on a click how can I speed up responsiveness?
[17:55:21] <hooloovoo> umm...
[17:55:28] <hooloovoo> karega|aniasis: example pls
[17:56:31] <Jon47> karega|aniasis I think the answer you're looking for is "event delegation"
[17:57:03] <Axsuul> thanks for the links, already here is my problem more specifically https://gist.github.com/968f3274dfdf28c2fe5d
[17:59:31] <scar2> So, I want to have the dialog close when someone clicks outside of it. I tried this to no avail: http://pastebin.com/7zSxvWeQ
[17:59:57] <coldhead> ?g jquery outerclick
[17:59:58] <bot-t> coldhead, jQuery outerClick plugin - http://littleroom.se/playground/outerClick/
[18:00:40] <scar2> coldhead: thanks i will play with that
[18:02:20] <coldhead> that's what my boyfriend said
[18:03:27] <Axsuul> How would I pass in a variable's value to the callback function at the exact moment .slideDown is called on a jQuery object?
[18:03:49] <Axsuul> For me there is a race condition which seems to be calling the variable's value at the time the callback function is called
[18:04:04] <snover> eh?
[18:08:59] <Axsuul> snover: https://gist.github.com/968f3274dfdf28c2fe5d

[18:09:35] <snover> thanks ajpiano
[18:09:35] <Axsuul> well this is not my scenario exactly
[18:09:44] <Axsuul> im not using it in a for loop
[18:09:56] <snover> ajpiano: my brain just said “dojo.partial” :|
[18:09:59] <Axsuul> but more like it's using the current variable's value
[18:10:08] <snover> I’M LOSIN IT
[18:10:19] <ajpiano> Axsuul: post code that you're using, not code that illustrates other common mistakes
[18:10:20] <Axsuul> I want it so that I can pass in a variable and use its value
[18:10:27] <Axsuul> sure'
[18:18:02] <scar2> if i wanted to add a functon to the trigger of closing a dialog window, how would i have like a particular "highlight bar" (the example from jquery themeroller) appear then fade away after X seconds?
[18:39:33] <mekapses> hey, all… I've got a getJSON call that works fine except for on localhost where it only gives me the keys & not the json dict. Any ideas?
[18:42:23] <context> mekapses: what do your developer tools show you
[18:52:28] <mekapses> firebug console shows that I get a dict of json coming from the nonlocal host (it's the main git repos for the project, so the code's the same) but the local  reply is only an array of the keys of the data
[18:59:42] <eddiemonge> mekapses: so then your local server isnt working correctly
[19:00:27] <rduplain> anyone have a recommendation for a form autosave plugin or reference?
[19:01:46] <mekapses> yeah, but when I do the backend calls by hand in python, I get a dict. the code's identical. and yet there's something clearly wrong.
[19:12:26] <RedOrigin> how do I replacce the contents of a div with content that is loaded from another the href of the link that was clicked on but only if it has object tags
[19:15:11] <RedOrigin> I mean, when a link is clicked on I want to load only the contents of that page that has object tags and replace the contents of a div with the loaded contents.
[19:20:10] <jgspratt> Hey, how do I structure a full (document).ready <script> area to fire a selector to get _all_ of my inputs and make them readonly?
[19:21:09] <jgspratt> is $(document).ready(function(){ ... }); right?
[19:21:16] <jgspratt> if so, what should I put in the ...?
[19:21:43] <jgspratt> do I have to write another function?
[19:23:30] <asdf`> jgspratt, you can use $("input").attr('readonly','readonly')
[19:23:47] <jgspratt> right, ok, but do I need to do another function?
[19:24:00] <jgspratt> like a $('.step1_submit').click(function()  somehow?
[19:24:26] <asdf`> jgspratt, i don't think so, just put that call inside your ready-function body
[19:24:45] <jgspratt> ok.  it works!
[19:26:47] <asdf`> how can i create a data object (for $.getJSON) using data from multiple <input>-s? Like, i have a <input name=a value=15>, so i want to feed the getJSON something like {a:15}
[19:27:00] <danzik17> jgspratt: one small modification:  use .prop( 'readOnly', true ) instead of attr - readonly is a DOM property rather than an attribute
[19:27:01] <asdf`> oh wait, serializeArray does that?
[19:27:45] <jgspratt> danzik17: thanks.
[19:28:16] <asdf`> (yeah, it does)
[19:28:29] <RedOrigin> I'm trying to make it so that when a link is clicked it loads/replaces the contents of a certain div. At the moment though my code is loading the whole page into a div. How do I make it load only what I want it too?
[19:29:25] <asdf`> RedOrigin, you're using something like $("#someDiv").load("foo.html #otherdiv")?
[19:30:01] <pc-moon> hello , i wanna help , how i can change values of get ex: example.com/?p=home i wanna way way to change p=index
[19:30:50] <RedOrigin> asdf`: everything except for the last part
[19:32:28] <RedOrigin> I'm putting var url = $(this).attr('href'); in place of the url, so can I do .load("url #object")?
[19:32:47] <Chani> ok, I'm sick of debug-by-alert(). there's a better way, right?
[19:32:51] <eddiemonge> RedOrigin: with .load, the first part is the url and then if you add a space and a selector, it will only take that selector from the new page
[19:32:57] <eddiemonge> Chani: console.log

[19:33:07] <Chani> eddiemonge: thanks :)
[19:33:25] <eddiemonge> RedOrigin: .load(url + " #object");
[19:34:47] <pc-moon> how change url only
[19:34:59] <RedOrigin> okay, my main problem was just trying to figure out how to grab the content, I'm using wordpress as my cms so I'm grabbing the contents of a post instead of a site page so it's not like I could just grab the div you know?
[19:36:53] <LabRaTT> red what are you trying to do with wordpress
[19:37:19] <Chani> haha, http://fixingthesejquery.com managed to crash konqueror already.
[19:37:28] <Chani> poor little browser
[19:37:30] <asdf`> to iterate over a json string, i should do something like `for (var key in data) { key, data[key]}`?
[19:37:39] <asdf`> a json structure, rather
[19:37:41] <eddiemonge> Chani: konqueror? why?
[19:37:49] <eddiemonge> asdf`: sure
[19:37:52] <Chani> eddiemonge: integration, and I'm used to it.
[19:38:13] <LabRaTT> RedOrigin what are you trying to do with wordpress
[19:38:30] <Chani> it's sort of fail at ajax, though... the webkit plugin makes it mostly-work... but not enough to debug anything reliably
[19:38:32] <RedOrigin> LabRaTT: sorry, kid is distracting me.
[19:38:57] <jgspratt> danzik17: actually, .prop( 'readOnly', true ) has no effect.
[19:39:54] <Chani> I'm, like, thiiiis close to breaking down and seeing if I can write a kde integration plugin for FF or chromium. they need better Activity support anyways
[19:39:56] <RedOrigin> LabRaTT: just one more sec. Thanks for your patience
[19:40:17] <danzik17> jgspratt: you sure?  http://jsfiddle.net/Unp6f/
[19:41:18] <LabRaTT> dan i like the edit if you dare part
[19:42:03] <RedOrigin> LabRaTT: here is my code         http://jsfiddle.net/RedOrigin/sZjc4/
[19:43:15] <LabRaTT> i think you need a space between a and .
[19:43:33] <jgspratt> danzik17: different version of jquery I guess
[19:43:43] <RedOrigin> What I'm trying to do is make it so that when you click on a link it turns the href into a variable named url, then load the content of a post into another div.
[19:46:04] <LabRaTT> messing with it now
[19:54:44] <pmcgovern> Hello everyone
[19:54:52] <ryanneufeld> how does sortable differentiate between a click that is for dragging and one that is a proper click?
[19:55:15] <pmcgovern> if one function calls another function and that second function returns false, what is the proper method of detecting that it returned false?
[19:55:36] <pmcgovern> this does not seem to work: if ($(this).validate.init(this) === false){
[19:57:19] <jrobey> pmcgovern: that code doesn't seemed factored in a way I would expect. What is 'validate', an attribute or a class, or?
[19:58:00] <pmcgovern> a function: new function() { $.fn.validate = {
[19:58:16] <jrobey> ah. you are not calling it in your example, you left out the ()
[19:58:34] <pmcgovern> $(this).validate.init(this); works fine
[19:58:43] <ryanneufeld> jrobey: that's not it either
[19:58:45] <pmcgovern> i am trying to catch a failure
[19:59:06] <jrobey> i do see - i was thinking of something else. continue -you are saying that you want to detect the return value of 'init'?
[19:59:09] <ryanneufeld> I'm not sure how
[19:59:20] <jrobey> perhaps i
[19:59:25] <ryanneufeld> cause you're not calling a function, so validate is not bein called
[19:59:42] <pmcgovern> jrobey: no - i want to detect if the function returns true or false
[19:59:46] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ pmcgovern
[19:59:46] <bot-t> pmcgovern, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/

[20:06:24] <blip_> Any jQuery guru's in the house? :P I need to traverse an XML file to find the .length() of an element. However, the .length() doesn't seem to want to work.
[20:06:46] <bot-t> blip_, .length is not a function, it is a property. $("div").length, not $("div").length()
[20:08:17] <blip_> bot-t Oh my! So I just leave off the parenthesis and it'll work?
[20:10:16] <blip_> bot-t Thanks for clearing that up. How embarrassing! xD
[20:10:33] <pmcgovern> ryanneufeld: any luck?
[20:24:15] <pmcgovern> does anyone else know how to have a function return true or false and have the line that called that function react to that return? :: if (callFunc() === false) { foes not work
[20:29:44] <asdf`> pmcgovern, you can just do `if (callFunc()) { foo }`
[20:29:59] <pmcgovern> no shit
[20:31:50] <pmcgovern> does seem to be working - shows as false every time

[21:00:35] <denysonique> the element is input#frmLogin:​strCustomerLogin_userID
[21:00:38] <bot-t> denysonique, If you wish to use any of the meta-characters (#;&,.+*~':"!^$[]()=>|/ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\. http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ Also this is probably a bad idea, but... http://j.mp/autoescapeselector
[21:00:40] <denysonique> I don't know how to escape the :

[21:01:34] <denysonique> wierd
[21:01:40] <denysonique> ok works thaks

[21:55:19] <gonssal> i'm using the jquery ui sortables feature to make some fancy stuff, but when i use the receive event, it only works the second time i drag and drop an element

[22:29:43] <tw2113> am I going to have to escape the closing </script> part myself to get it to properly add to the html?
[22:30:00] <tw2113> or is there another way to do this?
[22:32:08] <tw2113> i would love to get this to work and allow me to load all ads at the end of the page
[22:32:40] <cook1es> gonssal: that seems to do it, thanks!
[22:33:29] <ngharo> tw2113: pretty sure jquery will strip and interpet script tags
[22:33:51] <ngharo> tw2113: instead, you could append the script tag to head
[22:34:01] <ngharo> not using jquery
[22:34:53] <ngharo> ?data @ kenperkins
[22:34:54] <bot-t> kenperkins, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[22:34:56] <gonssal> tw2113: element.append('<script>blabla</script>');
[22:35:15] <tw2113> hmm
[22:35:34] <kenperkins> related ngharo: does it seem crazy to think you have to delay links for tracking to succeed?
[22:35:52] <tw2113> i'm hating this issue because it's a page that has ads along the sidebars, and they're slow and thus delay the rendering of the rest of the page
[22:35:59] <tw2113> and the ad code is set from the backend
[22:36:03] <tw2113> so i'm in a weird spot :D
[22:36:17] <gonssal> tw2113: don't see why
[22:36:41] <tw2113> so basically at the end of the page, use some js to append it all to the head?
[22:37:00] <ngharo> tw2113: http://api.jquery.com/append/#comment-61121802
[22:37:40] <gonssal> if you want to load them after everything is loaded, use $(window).load
[22:37:45] <gonssal> read doc
[22:37:52] <tw2113> k
[22:38:10] <tw2113> thx
[22:38:31] <ngharo> kenperkins: delay?
[22:38:51] <kenperkins> i.e. page navigates before analytics are tracked
[22:40:37] <ngharo> that does seem a bit crazy, but then again I'm not all that familiar with the intricacies of analytics
[22:44:35] <kenperkins> as you can imagine, i lose events when crossing page boundaries
[22:46:14] <mgeary> hi folks
[22:47:30] <mgeary> i am trying to implement a "click off" on a hand-rolled fake popup menu. From the docs, it appeared that i could use focus/blur for this, even though form elements aren't involved. However, even though i'm manually calling foo.focus() when the popup div is shown, clicking off the div isn't calling the blur event. Am i missing something?
[22:49:51] <ngharo> bind click to body and check event.target != popup || $(event.target).closest(popup).length === 0
[22:51:28] <mgeary> so blur indeed does not work
[22:51:55] <ngharo> i never used it on non inputs
[23:02:04] <Heshanh> hey guys how do i select a input box that has name data[Mentor][id]
[23:02:38] <Heshanh> nvm got it :D
[23:29:37] <kenperkins> sigh
[23:29:45] <kenperkins> moving data around on the client is such a bitch
[23:30:09] <seancurtis> just noticed there's a mirror for jquery ui?
[23:30:13] <kenperkins> (moving == from http to https)
[23:30:15] <seancurtis> http://jqueryui.it
[23:30:22] <seancurtis> seems the styles are borked
[23:30:58] <seancurtis> http://jqueryui.it/demos is borked
[23:37:52] <dandaman> hey
[23:38:18] <dandaman> so i want to change the onclick function of a button
[23:38:27] <dandaman> but i don't want to replace the current onclick that it has
[23:38:37] <dandaman> i want to add to it
[23:38:39] <dandaman> can i do that?
[23:38:58] <seancurtis> function myfunc() { ... }; $('button').click(myfunc);
[23:39:05] <seancurtis> you have to name the function you add
[23:39:11] <seancurtis> always good to name your functions
[23:39:18] <seancurtis> that way you can unbind specific ones
[23:39:38] <seancurtis> instead of $('button').bind(function() {});
[23:39:39] <dandaman> hmm hold on lemme pastebin something
[23:41:03] <dandaman> http://pastebin.com/VTfG1LJA
[23:41:15] <dandaman> so will both the alerts come on after a click
[23:41:19] <dandaman> or just the sup bro
[23:41:26] <dandaman> only the sup bro, right?
[23:43:45] <seancurtis> did you try it?
[23:44:38] <dandaman> i just assumed it wouldnt work :\
[23:45:44] <seancurtis> good to play around in http://jsbin.com or http://jsfiddle.net
[23:45:45] <dandaman> jsfiddler says it works
[23:45:48] <dandaman> thank you sir
[23:45:50] <seancurtis> here: http://jsbin.com/umokor/
[23:46:06] <seancurtis> or just, you know, do a simple page in a browser...
[23:46:29] <seancurtis> I prefer jsbin because the layout is simpler and you get more screen realestate :)
