[00:07:20] <poppiez> any way to capture IE6 using $.support?
[00:08:58] <pifantastic> poppiez: what do you need it for? Conditional comments are the best way to execute javascript for specific versions of IE
[00:12:36] <poppiez> pifantastic: my site doesn't support IE6. I have no idea why, but it doesn't render properly. I don't even bother checking out why. I just want to see if it's IE6 and exclude it
[00:13:42] <pifantastic> poppiez: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537512(v=vs.85).aspx
[00:17:43] <poppiez> pifantastic: well, thx :)
[00:54:00] <granden> Hi guys, thingking of learning jquery a bit better then today. So starting from the begining. Which books would you recommend?  Know PHP/Java from earlier so dont need a beginners guide to programming.
[00:54:33] <granden> "Pro PHP and jQuery, by Jason Lengstorf" is one of the books I think of getting.
[00:54:55] <granden> And this one, "Learning jQuery, third edition: raw"
[00:55:03] <granden> by " Jonathan Chaffer, Karl Swedberg, John Resig"
[01:10:35] <raj> Cork, I could really use your help if you're around
[01:12:19] <tetradon> raj, what do you need help on?
[01:12:30] <raj> hi
[01:12:36] <raj> I wrote this script
[01:12:37] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/wWUdf/7/
[01:12:44] <raj> but I'm having tons of trouble
[01:12:47] <raj> ...weird trouble
[01:12:57] <raj> I can't seem to troubleshoot the behavior either
[01:13:19] <raj> I can't even work on other stuff till this is done
[01:14:05] <tetradon> Okay so what kind of trouble are you having from it?
[01:14:28] <tetradon> What do you want it to do?
[01:14:30] <raj> this one has the parens correctly formatted http://jsfiddle.net/wWUdf/9/
[01:14:40] <raj> I want it to remove the selected choice from the new sort box
[01:14:59] <raj> but first of all, if you select Dogs for the first one, and then Cats
[01:15:05] <raj> Cats is still there in the 3rd box
[01:24:31] <raj> tetradon, any thoughts?
[01:25:08] <tetradon> the for loop is ugly
[01:25:28] <tetradon> lol
[01:25:32] <raj> all of them are
[01:25:45] <raj> there's gotta be a better way to do this
[01:26:04] <raj> i don't see why the code doesn't work though
[01:26:05] <tetradon> well especially this one: for(var j=0;j<$select_temp.find('option').length;j++)
[01:26:08] <raj> like, why wasn't Cat removed
[01:26:21] <raj> cuz I couldn't use `i` again?
[01:28:15] <tetradon> well apparently odd number of times, it works kind of
[01:29:05] <tetradon> the odd names selected I mean
[01:29:31] <tetradon> it's not finding the elements correctly always
[01:29:36] <raj> good eyes
[01:32:19] <tetradon> I could help you better if I wasn't so tired, lol
[01:32:35] <tetradon> I'm ready to pass out
[01:32:39] <raj> damn
[01:32:45] <raj> i've been doing this since freaking yesterday
[01:32:48] <raj> and this is what I've got
[01:32:52] <raj> a broken pos
[01:32:55] <raj> so mad
[01:36:25] <tetradon> raj: Well I would just get some rest...cool down a bit and come back to it when you aren't frustrated
[01:36:47] <raj> that's what I thought last night
[01:36:49] <raj> lol
[01:36:55] <tetradon> plus cork will be online later and I'm sure he'll have this working for you in no time
[01:37:13] <raj> oh
[01:37:20] <raj> k
[01:37:42] <raj> thanks for looking
[01:37:58] <tetradon> alright I desperately need sleep. sorry I couldn't help that much. good luck raj.
[01:38:06] <raj> goodnight
[01:38:11] <tetradon> goodnight
[01:55:13] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: yt?
[01:55:24] <someprimetime> or pif
[01:56:07] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/NpH4k/3/ if you're interested i made that string splitter and to insert a <br /> in the middle of longer strings
[01:57:39] <pen> I wonder what this is "[{"data": "1"}]"
[01:57:48] <pen> JSON.parse wouldn't parse this
[01:57:51] <pen> I wonder why
[01:59:36] <pen> why can't JSON parse this?
[02:04:16] <rue> pen: Is it really "\"[{ and so on? JSON needs an array or an object
[02:04:40] <pen> rue: so what is that? just a string with escaped "s""
[02:04:42] <pen> ??
[02:05:04] <pen> rue: I want to JSON.parse(string)
[02:06:22] <rue> Trying to eliminate problems, I'm asking whether the "" are part of the JSON content, or are you using them to indicate that you're inside a string
[02:06:39] <pen> that's what I see in console.log
[02:06:46] <pen> from a javascript object
[02:14:02] <pen> ok, I think I know what it is
[02:14:10] <pen> it is a string with all double quotes escaped
[02:14:19] <pen> now I just need to know how to convert that into JSON
[02:18:27] <snizzzzle> I'm trying to apply css to a popup box but it is not inheriting the style.  Is that because the css was already loaded for the parent page?
[02:19:27] <snizzzzle> The element that is not inheriting is a fieldset
[02:22:58] <pen> nvm, I figured out
[02:25:02] <cheshair> Hi! I have this simple snippet that allows me to display images when pressing an anchor tag (it uses fancybox): http://dpaste.com/720798/ Now I want those images to appear as pop up as soon as the page loads
[02:25:08] <cheshair> is that feasible?
[02:25:16] <cheshair> how can i modify that snippet?
[02:37:31] <juho3> ri
[03:46:03] <lenswipe> hey guys
[03:46:12] <lenswipe> how do i get the currently selected <option> in a dropdown?
[03:47:44] <WesleyL> $('select option:selected')
[04:13:34] <lenswipe> WesleyL, thanks
[04:13:35] <lenswipe> also
[04:14:23] <lenswipe> if i want to check to see if an element contains something how do i do that?
[04:15:10] <dabear_> lenswipe: contains what?
[04:15:12] <dabear_> text?
[04:15:21] <lenswipe> sort of
[04:15:26] <lenswipe> i have a list of users right?
[04:15:32] <lenswipe> each user is a div inside an li
[04:15:33] <dabear_> right
[04:15:42] <lenswipe> i want to check to see if that user has already been "added"
[04:15:47] <lenswipe> if so then then you cant add them again
[04:15:51] <lenswipe> lemme get you a link
[04:16:02] <dabear_> $parent.find("div.someuser").length > 0
[04:16:13] <lenswipe> http://95.146.89.149/prismvc/bookings/add
[04:16:43] <lenswipe> dabear_, see the user picker thing? i want to only be able to add a user once
[04:16:50] <lenswipe> after that nothing happens
[04:17:13] <dabear_> yeah
[04:17:16] <dabear_> so just code it
[04:17:24] <dabear_> I gave you an example above
[04:18:17] <granden> Which would you say is the best book to learn jquery? Or is there any good beginners guides on the net?
[04:19:01] <granden> I would need one to learn jquery, and a friend would need one to learn  jquery but as well basic programming knowledge.
[04:22:19] <lenswipe> dabear_, ($('ul.thumbnails').find("li div input[type=\"hidden\"]").val($.find('select option:selected').attr('data-id')).length
[04:22:22] <lenswipe> that seems not to be working
[04:22:24] <lenswipe> any ideas?
[04:22:59] <dabear_> yeah, that piecode of code does not make sense at all
[04:23:09] <lenswipe> jquery seems to agree with you on that :p
[04:23:17] <dabear_> find a common parent, save that to a variable
[04:23:23] <lenswipe> ok....
[04:23:38] <dabear_> var $someCOMMONPARENT = $("#foooo")
[04:23:47] <dabear_> start with that
[04:24:01] <dabear_> then, what elements do you wanna search?
[04:24:03] <dabear_> a div?
[04:24:06] <dabear_> what div?
[04:24:24] <lenswipe> dabear_, http://95.146.89.149/prismvc/bookings/add
[04:24:31] <lenswipe> see the user picker thing?
[04:24:48] <dabear_> dude
[04:24:48] <lenswipe> each user picker block contains a hidden input
[04:24:50] <lenswipe> ?
[04:25:07] <dabear_> these are questions you need to answer to build this thing
[04:26:01] <dabear_> for example var $allNames = $someFCKINGPARENT.find("div.thumbnail h6")
[04:26:19] <dabear_> now you have all current divs' names in a variable
[04:26:43] <dabear_> $allNames.filter( function(){  return this.innerHTML == "donkey kong"});
[04:26:58] <dabear_> that gives you all divs with a name of donkey kong inside
[04:27:11] <dabear_> if $thatresult.length > 0
[04:27:32] <dabear_> then don't add the participant again
[04:27:46] <dabear_> note that im pseudo coding a bit here
[04:28:05] <dabear_> you should figure out the rest your self
[04:28:24] <lenswipe> ok
[04:29:53] <lenswipe> my problem is im trying to find elements that have a hidden input feild with a value of n
[04:33:54] <lenswipe> dabear_, http://pastebin.com/2cvjUx7t
[04:33:58] <lenswipe> thats what i have so far
[04:34:37] <lenswipe> thats giving a type error
[04:34:51] <lenswipe> http://pastebin.com/5TzHkm8U
[04:37:25] <dabear_> lenswipe: start again
[04:37:29] <lenswipe> ..?
[04:37:32] <lenswipe> dafuq?
[04:37:45] <dabear_> this.children is a dom node list
[04:37:57] <lenswipe> and var $parent = $("ul.thumbnails"); is return "undefined"
[04:37:58] <dabear_> it does not have a .val
[04:38:00] <lenswipe> okay
[04:38:25] <lenswipe> can you see what im trying to do though?
[04:38:26] <dabear_> there is no $.find
[04:39:06] <dabear_> you most probably want $("something").find or $something.find
[04:39:16] <lenswipe> ok
[04:39:53] <dabear_> generally, try to do one thing at a time
[04:39:57] <lenswipe> in var $allNames = $someFCKINGPARENT.find("div.thumbnail h6") what is $someFCKINGPARENT ?
[04:40:04] <dabear_> console.log(your result)
[04:40:09] <lenswipe> ok
[04:40:20] <lenswipe> i think ima go lie down
[04:40:21] <dabear_> it is some fucking parent that you choose and save to a variable
[04:40:30] <lenswipe> im very tired
[04:40:39] <lenswipe> ill have a nap and come back to it with a fresh mind
[05:17:56] <reisi> is there a helper in jquery to render an XML node? (obtained through xpathing a document parsed by jquery)
[05:24:05] <last1> I am writing this script and I see this error in Firefox (Firebug) : uncaught exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: )
[05:24:10] <last1> no line number or anything else
[05:24:16] <last1> how do I track it down further ?
[05:25:09] <jacof> I want to create a process that starts with a form submission. Through AJAX, I'll get a response from the first PHP, and then, send that response to another, and another, and so on. What's the basic approach to this ?
[06:14:50] <Woet> SELECT * FROM foo JOIN bar ON bar.id = foo.id - this will make sure there is both a record in foo as bar with the same ID
[06:15:04] <Woet> how do I do the inverse? to get the records from foo with nothing in bar?
[06:15:17] <Woet> wait, I should go a channel down :)
[06:16:19] <minna> Hello
[06:16:46] <minna> I have some code after some alert code, but the code after the alert executes before the user have pressed OK, how can i prevent that?
[06:19:40] <minna> Do i have to use a callback for this?
[06:20:19] <minna> Callback didnt work
[06:25:09] <arphen> hi guys, i'm looking to choose a javascript framework for building my website and i was wondering if there is a huge difference in performance/features between jquery,prototype and whatnot or if it simply a matter of personal taste.
[06:30:07] <minna> arphen: It's much about personal taste, but jquery is faster.
[06:30:23] <minna> arphen: probably a lot faster.
[06:33:40] <arphen> thanks for the reply minna , would you say jquery is a superclass of or equal to prototype in terms of functionality?
[06:34:59] <minna> They are both javascript, you should not be limited with either one you choose.
[06:35:33] <minna> arphen: But since i use jquery for all my projects, big or large, im kind of biased towards jquery.
[06:36:07] <minna> arphen: what kind of app are you bulding?
[06:49:46] <arphen> minna, i'm heavy on user interaction with the server
[06:50:35] <arphen> lot's of forms.... basically i'm failing to make it nice looking, because i'm a noob at design.
[06:52:25] <arphen> minna: check it out if you like http://188.174.111.174/home/Sites/InstantFeedback/index.html#
[06:52:38] <minna> arphen: Ok, checking
[06:52:39] <arphen> use peter//peter as a login for students
[06:53:12] <arphen> Technische Mechanik is a course with subcourses and questions..
[06:53:38] <minna> Can't access the server
[06:53:41] <minna> not available
[06:53:47] <arphen> ah bummer
[06:53:49] <arphen> hold on a sec
[06:53:52] <minna> Ok
[06:55:10] <arphen> try again
[06:56:23] <arphen> i'm happy with it functionality-wise mostly (project's a week old). i'm mostly looking for ways to make my javascript code less ugly and make the interface "beautiful"
[06:57:17] <minna> Hm, there's too much ajax here. I'd concentrate on getting regular html work first.
[06:57:40] <minna> And this wont have any fallback whatsoever.
[06:58:03] <minna> theres a lot of jquery plugins to make forms looks good
[06:58:11] <arphen> I'm really new to webdev.
[06:58:20] <arphen> i didn't know javascript (nor ruby) 3 weeks ago
[06:58:45] <minna> Ok, well, i think your starting in the wrong end.
[06:59:16] <minna> if you continue with making it ajax only, you will be buried in complexity, thats almost a certainty
[06:59:34] <minna> make it work with html/css and ruby (on rails?) in the backend first.
[06:59:42] <minna> javascript should not be the main language
[07:00:20] <minna> of course, some may dissagree with that, but then again, those who dissagree have very slick frameworks they have built to manage the complexity.
[07:00:45] <minna> it's basically the same with any webdev
[07:00:53] <minna> planning before doing is key
[07:01:31] <minna> and i see you are using TYPO3
[07:01:49] <minna> that is a HUGE system with a lot of complexity
[07:02:16] <jacof> How to send big chunks of data through $.ajax() ? Can I just .serialize() forever? It's returning an error because the serialized string is resulting as an array. What should I do ?
[07:02:17] <SoulRaven> anyone know how i can generate something like this with jquery, http://s18.postimage.org/wasi2cj91/unknow_element.jpg
[07:02:26] <minna> you could build this much easier by using codeigniter or any other good php framework
[07:02:44] <SoulRaven> http://postimage.org/image/wasi2cj91/
[07:02:57] <minna> SoulRaven: split columns?
[07:03:10] <SoulRaven> yes
[07:03:45] <s1n4> hello, I cannot load an https url that contains json data, with using .getJSON()
[07:04:00] <minna> SoulRaven: something simple here: http://methvin.com/splitter/vbasic.html
[07:04:04] <s1n4> $.getJSON()*
[07:04:30] <SoulRaven> minna: but how i switch the elements from one column to another
[07:05:55] <minna> SoulRaven: That's up to you to code in jquery, moving/cloning/removing/creating etc..
[07:06:08] <minna> SoulRaven: Have not found any complete solution for this.
[07:07:01] <SoulRaven> minna: thx, i know, i have find a solution like this, but i don't have find, so i will try to make my own
[07:08:44] <minna> SoulRaven: it is called a listbox, i just found a plugin for it http://www.meadmiracle.com/dlb/DLBPlugin.aspx
[07:09:01] <minna> SoulRaven: http://www.meadmiracle.com/dlb/DLBDocumentation.aspx
[07:09:06] <SoulRaven> minna: oau....thx
[07:10:10] <minna> here is a different type https://github.com/mpalmerlee/jQuery-UI-Listbox
[07:11:08] <minna> SoulRaven: those two seem to be the only ones in existance
[07:11:15] <minna> (as open source)
[07:11:37] <SoulRaven> this is what i want, somethink like this, i will check now the code, for this: http://www.meadmiracle.com/dlb/DLBPlugin.aspx
[07:11:59] <rabbi1> i am using jquery.dynamicform for duplicating the fields, i am doing it successfully, but how can i get the data entered in the field as i am not sure how many fields (for e.g. phone fields) will be entered by user, ?
[07:12:03] <SoulRaven> i want to create the posibilty for the users to create groups of vehicles
[07:13:01] <arphen> Sorry minna I got disconnected there.
[07:13:10] <minna> SoulRaven: This plugin uses a multi-select dropdown
[07:13:31] <SoulRaven> yes, i have see that, sems easy to implement
[07:13:54] <minna> arphen: ok, im pasting what i wrote, to prive chat
[07:15:10] <arphen> lovely
[07:15:25] <minna> arphen: do you see it?
[07:15:58] <arphen> yes thank you.
[07:16:07] <arphen> Well i'm a bit limited in my choices.
[07:16:28] <arphen> My boss _really_ wants it done with ruby(not rails) in the backend and as ajax as possible
[07:16:48] <minna> arphen: Then i hope he wan't to pay for it :)
[07:16:57] <arphen> wan't?
[07:17:40] <minna> want
[07:17:53] <arphen> i'm being paid very little but i'm a student and this work is very rewarding for me anyway. I'm learning so much and I have plenty of time.
[07:18:28] <minna> arphen: In that case, do it carefully and plan every step ahead, then when you have the html, css and planning done, you can start building.
[07:19:08] <minna> arphen: And you can build it with ajax even thought the foundation is in html/css
[07:19:28] <minna> arphen: i'm quite sure your boss wont know the difference anyway.
[07:20:02] <arphen> minna,  i'm still unsure what you mean by "planning". And I can't really do much in html, and css can be added for proper theming later ( as far as i understood this)
[07:20:22] <arphen> I'm studying EE & IT so maybe i'm getting this from the wrong perspective.
[07:21:03] <arphen> I was going to leave the logic and validations on the server in ruby, then pass the client all the information he needs for displaying when he requests it, and let the client handle the front end (In javascript).
[07:21:14] <arphen> Then I make ajax calls to communicate back the student's results.
[07:21:22] <arphen> Am I getting something basic wrong here?
[07:21:39] <arphen> I can't really make "html" layouts since all of the stuff is dynamic content.
[07:22:28] <arphen> I have different courses which have different subcourses which in turn have an array of questions. there can be n questions for each subcourse in each course, so as far as i thought through it, everything is dynamic.
[07:22:39] <arphen> to my understanding html is static, so what should i do in html?
[07:22:47] <arphen> (I'm focusing on the content part)
[07:23:06] <arphen> (not menues and stuff, i was gonna do that later, when I know what exactly i need)
[07:23:29] <minna> arphen: we can continue this in private chat
[07:35:17] <MagmaRules> Hi there, anyone knows if there is a way to make this kind of layout resize in realtime: http://layout.jquery-dev.net/demos/accordion.html ?
[07:35:37] <MagmaRules> This one resizes in realtime and its inside a dialog: http://layout.jquery-dev.net/demos/layout_inside_dialog.html
[07:35:44] <Sebah> I'm having some difficulties with a json response. This is what I get {"Success":true,"ErrorMessage":null}. How exactly should my if statements look? if (data.response == 'success') { //.do whateva }? Is this right?
[07:40:26] <dabear_> Sebah: if(data.success)
[07:42:30] <Sebah> dabear_ doesn't seem to be working...
[07:42:45] <dabear_> Sebah: console.log(data) and see
[07:43:23] <Sebah> dabear_ this is my function http://pastebin.com/yTi987s6
[07:43:33] <dabear_> lol
[07:43:53] <dabear_> and how would that help me in any way?
[07:44:27] <dabear_> Sebah: console.log(data) and see..
[07:44:36] <dabear_> what data actually is returned
[07:46:01] <Sebah> this is what the log says 'Object { Success=true, ErrorMessage=null}' ( i'm not really familiar with json to be honest... )
[07:47:16] <dabear_> ok, if(data.success)
[07:47:19] <dabear_> will work then
[07:47:23] <dabear_> hm
[07:47:30] <dabear_> if(data.Success)
[07:47:31] <dabear_> sorry
[07:48:26] <Sebah> dabear_ and I throw in a else {//with the stuff I want when the Success=false}, right :D?
[07:50:06] <dabear_> y
[07:50:24] <Sebah> dabear_ you're a star!
[07:52:21] <dabear_> Sebah: last time I checked, I wasn't glued to the sky at night
[07:52:41] <Sebah> dabear_ I meant like a super star, you know, the ones created by media :P
[07:53:15] <dabear_> are you saying that media created me, and not my mom and dad?
[07:54:14] <Sebah> dabear_ we're heading to a dead end with this discussion :)
[07:54:40] <dabear_> which end is dead?
[07:55:03] <dabear_> are you implying  there are ends that are alive?
[07:59:48] <^Mike> Is there a good javascript syntax highlighter for jquery?
[08:00:50] <otiuk> jsfiddle?
[08:17:49] <rabbi1> using jquery.fn.gantt.js the data from json (importing from .js) - doesn't work, but the same data copied manually works very well :( little confused
[08:20:29] <rabbi1> is there any other plugin for gantt chart, which can be customized ?
[08:28:21] <rabbi1> nobody in here ?
[08:29:04] <bios> lots of people in here.. not a lot paying attnetion :]
[09:56:36] <Advocated> i've got a div that im setting as display:none  and then i do a .show() on that div, but when i'm doing that, its moving everything a few pixels to the side. I think this is due to me having display:block-inline on the other elements. Any ideas?
[09:57:36] <rabbi1> Advocated: block-inline ?
[09:58:08] <Advocated> rabbi1, yeah?
[09:58:39] <rabbi1> Advocated: got page ? jsfiddle.net
[10:00:26] <rabbi1> Advocated: That's more likely css problem, #css might help, but again you got to provide the page to look at it.
[10:02:57] <Advocated> it shows fine, until i do: $('#client').show();  an example is: http://jsfiddle.net/Y3mvK/5/  but its not displaying well in there due to the small html display area. On mine all 4 of those icons are like  1  2  3  4
[10:05:58] <rabbi1> Advocated: I don see anything moving few pixels to the side.... :(
[10:06:02] <Advocated> Even tried applying  $('#client').css('display', 'inline-block');  after the show()
[10:06:51] <Advocated> rabbi1, its only moving a couple of pixels, ie when i hover over the client icon, it jumps like 5px or a small amount to the left
[10:08:37] <Advocated> i think its because of jsfiddle not showing full screen you can't see it?
[10:08:42] <rabbi1> Advocated: "Search for Client1" moves to left or "Client" ?
[10:08:51] <rabbi1> actually in my system nothing moves
[10:08:56] <Advocated> the client blue icon if you get me
[10:09:01] <Advocated> in chrome im using
[10:10:08] <rabbi1> i am viewing it in chrome too, but on linux
[10:10:18] <Advocated> ditto
[10:10:54] <rabbi1> Advocated: for me , on hover, nothing is moving at all. might help if you send me send a working link,... in that case
[10:11:33] <Advocated> i dunno how i can give you a link to my localhost?
[10:12:56] <rabbi1> just with your ip, check in whatsmyip
[10:13:50] <rabbi1> i probably guess, if its just 2px or so then it could be the border problem or width problem, sometimes floating also....... so can't say much with this result ...
[10:15:58] <GhostCat> Hey, I've created some custom forms with jquery, but I need to read their data in php, how can I do this?  I tried to $_POST['form1'] variable and I don't get anything...
[10:16:07] <GhostCat> Dynamic forms* rather
[10:16:15] <Pietertjepeter> hi
[10:16:33] <Pietertjepeter> i keep getting the error jquery undefined
[10:16:52] <Pietertjepeter> what can it be, cause the jquery is clearly there and working from other methods
[10:18:26] <Advocated> rabbi1, i can't give access, its not getting through my firewall somehow :S ive given access but :S
[10:19:02] <rabbi1> Advocated: I am sorry, can't see the problem at all ......
[10:19:50] <rabbi1> GhostCat: I infact using Dynamic forms plugin
[10:20:11] <rabbi1> there is a link, how to get data from forms to php.
[10:21:11] <GhostCat> rabbil, But I'm just using regular forms, do I really need a plugin to read a post variable?
[10:21:51] <rabbi1> GhostCat: thought you are using a plugin, but that might help....
[10:22:07] <rabbi1> Advocated: Try checking with the borders removed
[10:22:58] <rabbi1> Advocated: I prefer using background color while testing, helps better than borders
[10:25:04] <Advocated> rabbi1, the borders on the icons?
[10:25:39] <rabbi1> Advocated: all places, try avoiding borders may mislead sometimes
[10:26:13] <rabbi1> i use background then border bottom the border top for testing purpose
[10:29:09] <Advocated> rabbi1, just removed all border references but unfortunately it does the same
[10:30:32] <rabbi1> Advocated: sorry boss, without knowing what's happening very difficult to suggest
[10:31:24] <Advocated> it moves a few pixels whichever icon is hovered, but once its done it once, its fine after that
[10:31:41] <rabbi1> Advocated: I am not even finding the problem in FF also :(
[10:32:33] <Advocated> also actually, before I had for each column: float:left;   it works fine like that, but i changed to: display:inline-block; to center it instead. That makes it break :s
[10:35:12] <Advocated> think i've fixed it
[10:35:14] <Advocated> maybe lol
[10:36:48] <rabbi1> Advocated: may be ?
[10:37:09] <Advocated> well its not moving now, but the content is jumping below
[10:38:28] <Advocated> rabbi1, see http://jsfiddle.net/Y3mvK/6/  if hovering over the client, the div displaying the form jumps down loads :S
[10:40:27] <rabbi1> Advocated: where do you want it to be displayed ?
[10:40:44] <Advocated> directly underneath, its moving the div with the black border a lot downwards
[10:41:27] <Advocated> it jumps down like 100px or something
[10:41:27] <miket3> Advocated, i lost internet connection so i dont know if you resolved your issue... but I noticed this on one of my apps... What i didnt notice is that the scroll bar was being added to the browser
[10:41:47] <rabbi1> Advocated: ok, i think i got it ..... JavaScript is must here  ?
[10:42:11] <Advocated> miket3, yeah it is, but why though?  basically it should show the div thats hidden. Its doing that but for some reason it seems to be pushing it down
[10:42:27] <rabbi1> Advocated: you can just use hover effect to display none and display: block/ inline. no need for JS.
[10:43:08] <Advocated> ill try that then cuz going around in circles..
[10:43:26] <Advocated> brb then, going to reformat this code

[10:47:21] <rabbi1> Advocated: user clear: both; for column bottom
[10:48:00] <arnpro> hey guys, I'm having a little strange issue when doing a $.getJSON call.... the data returned seems not to be handled like it should be: http://pastebin.com/LNRfyLyw I'm working with highcharts, and when I try to setData on a series object, it just doesn't work...
[10:51:54] <johnkpaul> arnpro: you shouldn't need to eval
[10:52:00] <johnkpaul> getJSON should pass json to your callback
[10:53:19] <arnpro> johnkpaul: I tried it without eval() won't work still
[10:55:13] <johnkpaul> hm, the problem is definitely with that
[10:55:25] <johnkpaul> can you try JSON.parse()
[10:55:53] <johnkpaul> oh, eval won't work there anyway, because eval needs the assignment as well I believe
[10:56:31] <arnpro> johnkpaul: tried JSON.parse() Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token D ... neither
[10:56:57] <johnkpaul> can you put this into a working jsfiddle? if there's a syntax error in the json, then eval won't work either
[10:57:34] <arnpro> I'll try

[10:59:27] <ImWritingInBush> Jimmy Carter is the only man for the job.
[10:59:50] <rabbi1> is there anything for disabling and enabling a text field on radio button's click ?
[11:04:44] <shoky> rabbi1, myradio.click(function() { mytextfield.attr('disabled','disabled'); })
[11:04:49] <shoky> for disabling
[11:05:31] <shoky> removeAttr('disabled') for enabling
[11:05:33] <rabbi1> shoky: thank you, any link ?
[11:05:41] <shoky> link?
[11:05:41] <rabbi1> shoky: kool .....
[11:06:12] <rabbi1> no its ok, i guess that should be enough.... asked to know about jquery link
[11:06:20] <shoky> jquery.com ?
[11:07:06] <rabbi1> shoky: yeah....
[11:07:29] <shoky> yuh....
[11:08:10] <rabbi1> shoky: as you were saying, i asked incase if there is a link., but later you gave all line, so no problem :) thanks
[11:08:44] <arnpro> johnkpaul: is there anyway to show errors in jsfiddle?
[11:08:45] <shoky> there are many links
[11:08:53] <johnkpaul> arnpro: check in the console
[11:19:22] <cambazz> hello, i was making $('myTable tr[sid="111"]) to get that row
[11:19:34] <cambazz> now i need to find 5th td under that row
[11:19:44] <cambazz> how can i do it with selection interface
[11:21:15] <codercube> $('myTable tr[sid="111"]).find("td").eq(4)
[11:21:58] <rabbi1> shoky: sorry, i have a different problem, i have four text fields, and 4 radio buttons next to it. all radio buttons are of same group. so selecting one should disable the other four, but my all 4 radio buttons will have the same id. how can i give onclick, because providing that will enable all fields
[11:23:21] <codercube> rabbi1 : it's incorrect to give one ID to several elements, you have to use one
[11:23:47] <shoky> or just $('myTable tr[sid="111"] td:eq(4)')
[11:24:49] <rabbi1> codercube: also, i am using a collapser plugin, (which is just show and hide)  here i want to show or hide several elements if the checkbox element is checked... i am able to show/ hide, but the checkbox is not checking
[11:25:13] <codercube> rabbi1 : post your code to jsfiddle so we can help
[11:27:21] <ImWritingInBush> I know who I'm voting for on November 3rd.
[11:28:09] <ImWritingInBush> Vote for Jimmy Carter and you could win a free Datsun.
[11:29:13] <shoky> rabbi1 you might wanna check .change() event
[11:38:23] <rabbi1> codercube: http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/x9gzN/
[11:39:48] <rabbi1> shoky: ^^ what i am trying to do is , on checking a checkbox a list of services should be displayed, and that list has a label, text field and radio button, again depending on the type of service, the radio button is selected, selected once should be enabled and other displayed
[11:43:45] <codercube> rabbi1 : why do you need to use some plugin here? isn't it like
[11:43:46] <codercube> ?$(".sub_serv_colap").on('change', function(){
[11:43:46] <codercube> $(this).next().slideToggle();
[11:43:46] <codercube> });?????????????????????????????
[11:43:47] <bot-t> codercube, Couldn't find "$(".sub_serv_colap").on('change', function(){" in jQuery Docs.
[11:45:39] <rabbi1> codercube: :-/
[11:46:33] <rabbi1> codercube: din't think of it, actually i got this plugin for something else, and later just used as i had it.
[11:47:11] <rabbi1> codercube: actually used it so that i can target the show/ hide element
[11:47:44] <rabbi1> in this case it's next, but in other places it wasn't ...
[11:53:15] <codercube> rabbi1 : you could use any selector you like, I wrote the line for the code you posted
[11:54:18] <rabbi1> codercube: i tried it infact, but its not working
[11:54:24] <shoky> rabbi1, http://jsfiddle.net/b2vbN/
[11:54:31] <rabbi1> codercube: is it exactly same ... ?
[11:55:16] <rabbi1> shoky: thanks, this is much better
[11:56:00] <raj> johnkpau_, I've got issues with my code that I haven't been able to solve
[11:56:07] <rabbi1> shoky: here i think i cannot give an id for input element. cannot use that, because the id are dynamic :(
[11:56:17] <johnkpaul> raj: ok, what are those issues?
[11:56:54] <rabbi1> so i have no idea wether it will be service1 or no, onlything available for me is li which parent element of that input field
[11:57:06] <shoky> rabbi1, ok.. if you have a specific problem, jsfiddle it and state the problem exactly
[11:57:22] <raj> johnkpaul, well, for starters, if you select Dogs first, and then Cats...Cats isn't removed from the third box http://jsfiddle.net/wWUdf/9/
[11:58:10] <rabbi1> shoky: its already in jsfiddle. my problem is that i can't use the id element from the input field, and but should work how it is now, simple
[11:58:37] <shoky> then use whatever you CAN use
[11:58:45] <beekir> i am having a mental lapse with regards to selecting inputs by value....
[11:59:20] <rabbi1> shoky: i did http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/b2vbN/1/
[11:59:24] <beekir> if i have an empty input node on a page, and the user is expected to type some value into it....  how can I select the input based on the current value that the user has provided?
[12:00:10] <beekir> <input>   -- I type "something" into it...  can't select it by $('input[value="something"]) -- really?
[12:00:53] <pajo> how can i detect if a key is hit not down?
[12:01:04] <shoky> rabbi1, i don't see anything different there
[12:01:11] <johnkpaul> raj: your code is fairly confusing and a lot to read through, can you give me the lines that you're expecting that behavior to happen in?
[12:01:29] <pajo> i have an ajax query everytime i press enter in a field, but keydown does it many times per hit
[12:01:31] <codercube> pajo keypress() , but there are some issues, see docs
[12:01:58] <rabbi1> shoky: the difference is i couldn't use the "id" of the input element.
[12:02:01] <raj> johnkpaul, the document.ready function, up to the end of the if($this_precedence==all_sortfields_num)
[12:02:29] <johnkpaul> :) that's not really shrinking it down much
[12:02:46] <johnkpaul> what is not working
[12:02:47] <raj> well, the document.ready is just setting up the variables to make it easier
[12:02:51] <johnkpaul> in terms of the code
[12:03:04] <raj> it's not supposed to allow a selected item to show up in the new the box
[12:03:15] <johnkpaul> and where is that enforced
[12:03:20] <johnkpaul> in the code
[12:03:29] <raj> $select_template.find(opt).remove()
[12:04:07] <raj> would be nice if there were line numbers in this
[12:05:47] <johnkpaul> so raj, does that line of code never get executed
[12:05:48] <beekir> in order to select an input by its current value, do I have to walk through all :input's to compare them by .val() ?
[12:05:59] <johnkpaul> or does that line of code get executed, but not have the result you expect?
[12:06:14] <johnkpaul> beekir: no, you can use [value= I beliebe
[12:06:15] <johnkpaul> ?:value
[12:06:16] <bot-t> johnkpaul, .val() - Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[12:06:38] <johnkpaul> $("input[value=foobar]")
[12:06:43] <johnkpaul> should work beekir
[12:06:49] <raj> johnkpaul, it executes, cuz Dogs is removed in the third box, but Cats isn't
[12:07:03] <shoky> rabbi1: http://jsfiddle.net/7SNMw/
[12:07:24] <shoky> not that i really understood what you want. but that should get you started
[12:07:58] <rabbi1> shoky: thanks a lot :) i was almost there http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/b2vbN/2/
[12:08:09] <beekir> johnkpaul:  yes, it should (!) work.  but if the input is added dynamically without a "value" attribute, and the user types some new value in there, it is not matched....
[12:08:11] <shoky> ;)
[12:08:25] <johnkpaul> hm, I actually thought that it worked anyway
[12:08:38] <johnkpaul> raj: have you ever used the step debugger before?
[12:08:46] <johnkpaul> try to make sure that it's runningh in both cases
[12:09:00] <rabbi1> shoky: that;s exactly what i wanted ;)
[12:09:07] <raj> i've used it once, but don't really remember how
[12:09:12] <shoky> groovy ;)
[12:09:16] <beekir> lame fix:  a change handler to set $(this).attr('value',$(this).val())
[12:09:47] <johnkpaul> beekir: or, you could .filter() for the one you're looking for
[12:10:00] <rabbi1> shoky: is there a need for plugin for dynamic form element creation ?
[12:10:17] <johnkpaul> hm, I'm realy surprised by that behavior, beekir, that might be a valid bug
[12:10:32] <ajpiano> nope
[12:10:43] <beekir> johnkpaul:  i'm very surprised myself.  i swear that this was working for me 30 minutes ago, but now i can reproduce it consistently with the most simple of HTML....
[12:10:51] <shoky> rabbi1: nope
[12:10:55] <ajpiano> the selector is only for matching the intiial attribute in the html
[12:10:59] <ajpiano> not the updated property
[12:11:02] <ajpiano> beekir ^^
[12:11:25] <rabbi1> shoky: how can i learn to do that without plugin ?
[12:11:29] <johnkpaul> ah ok, then it's on purpose
[12:11:36] <johnkpaul> beekir: you can use this
[12:11:36] <johnkpaul> http://jsfiddle.net/rK8ju/
[12:11:40] <shoky> rabbi1, read jquery tutorials :)
[12:11:47] <shoky> and API
[12:11:51] <johnkpaul> in my opinion, cleaner than setting the attribute directly
[12:12:00] <rabbi1> api .... thanks
[12:12:01] <beekir> johnkpaul:  Yep, filter will do it.  Thanks for your help!
[12:12:09] <beekir> ajpiano:  thanks as well.
[12:12:10] <johnkpaul> np
[12:12:41] <johnkpaul> raj: so I'd recommend putting a debugger; statement in that conditional
[12:12:46] <johnkpaul> and see if you end up there in both situations
[12:13:00] <raj> how do you do that?
[12:13:06] <johnkpaul> raj: http://michaelsync.net/2007/09/30/firebug-tutorial-script-tab-javascript-debugging
[12:13:23] <raj> thaks
[12:13:24] <raj> thanks
[12:14:17] <raj> learning to use this will probably make me stop littering my code with console.log
[12:14:26] <raj> my console output is ridiculous
[12:14:31] <ajpiano> or just put a breakpoint
[12:15:43] <raj> johnkpaul, do you think my approach is wrong, btw?
[12:15:48] <raj> like, is there a cleaner way to do this?
[12:16:30] <johnkpaul> in terms of the organization of your code, yes, there are many different ways to do it though
[12:16:57] <beekir> raj:  "can be improved" !== "wrong"
[12:17:10] <raj> well, it's currently wrong
[12:17:16] <johnkpaul> your approach in terms of functionalty is fine, I mean, I didn't read through all of it, but it seems to generally work
[12:17:23] <beekir> raj:  link me
[12:17:27] <johnkpaul> :) yeah, it would definitely be easier to debug the wrong parts if it was more organized
[12:17:31] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/wWUdf/9/
[12:17:35] <johnkpaul> also, learning the step debugger will change your life
[12:17:47] <johnkpaul> and then, after that, learning how to unit test will make you jump for joy
[12:17:49] <raj> johnkpaul, I agree
[12:18:01] <raj> i have yet to unit test anything in any language
[12:18:05] <raj> i've read aobut it
[12:18:08] <raj> and thought about doing it
[12:18:13] <johnkpaul> you should try
[12:18:13] <raj> but then never really acted on it
[12:18:27] <beekir> raj:  check out the jquery .each() operator -- it's cleaner to read than for() loops over a jquery collection
[12:18:47] <raj> beekir, for is supposed to be faster, so I try to use it if I'm not using closure
[12:18:53] <johnkpaul> raj: I'm actually uploading a talk that I gave last week to vimeo about jquery unit testing, I'll send you a link after
[12:19:00] <raj> afa my discussion the other day
[12:19:04] <johnkpaul> raj: those differences are minimal for something with 10 elements
[12:19:14] <raj> johnkpaul, cool, thanks
[12:19:17] <johnkpaul> extremely minimal
[12:19:17] <beekir> raj:  you're writing a dyanamically typed scripting language :)
[12:19:31] <raj> k
[12:20:16] <johnkpaul> raj: don't worry about overoptimizing something until you really have a reason to think your code is behaving slowly
[12:20:30] <raj> beekir, the problem is when you select Dogs in the first box and then Cats in the second...Cats for some reason isn't removed in the 3rd
[12:20:36] <johnkpaul> there's something to be said for anticipating bottlenecks, but when you're only talking about small numbers, I wouldn't worry about it
[12:20:38] <raj> johnkpaul, k
[12:20:43] <gtime> Hey does anyone know why this works, http://pastebin.com/Gz3vGWve , but when i try to reduce the two functions into one by using parameters, like so: http://pastebin.com/uz19ygHM , it doesn't work? is it something to do with addClass not taking variables or something?
[12:21:33] <beekir> gtime:  give me a minute to catch up and i'll take a look
[12:21:50] <gtime> thanks :)
[12:22:07] <beekir> raj:  so what this code is supposed to do, should be to limit each new "select" element so it does not offer any previously selected values?
[12:22:17] <raj> exactly
[12:23:02] <beekir> OK.  Then try this for an expirament:  Build an array that contains all possible values.  Every time a new <select> element is generated, add an <option> with value of every element in the arrya.
[12:23:28] <beekir> array***  Then delete the value from the array, so the next select won't contain it.
[12:23:50] <raj> isn't that what i'm doing using the $select_template
[12:24:00] <beekir> it's your code, you tell me ;)
[12:24:05] <raj> johnkpaul, do you have a chrome version as well for that article?
[12:24:12] <raj> beekir, I believe I am
[12:24:26] <johnkpaul> raj: it's very similar, but I don't have one in my bookmarks
[12:24:32] <johnkpaul> google for one
[12:24:46] <raj> kk, this one is pretty good
[12:25:54] <gtime> can anyone help me?
[12:25:58] <sportman> is there a way to have a hover or mousover work when dragging?
[12:27:18] <rabbi1> shoky: in the previous work, you have used $(this).prev(). removeAttr.... how can i do that for the 2nd next element can't use next here as the textfield is the third element after radio button
[12:27:30] <beekir> gtime:  you should work on your mastery of jquery selectors
[12:27:31] <johnkpaul> gtime: can you separate the code that you want us to compare?
[12:27:58] <beekir> $(document.getElementById(theidinq)) is pretty backwards when you think of how jquery selectors should work
[12:28:12] <beekir> $('#id') is a much more expressive equivalent
[12:29:13] <beekir> lines 10 and 11 could be compressed down to:
[12:29:34] <gtime> yeah
[12:29:42] <shoky> rabbi1, not sure what you mean
[12:29:47] <beekir> $('#'+theidinq).find('path').attr('fill','#000').end().removeClass(shinebut).addClass(nulbut)
[12:29:56] <gtime> i dothing think just $('#id') works in ajax
[12:30:10] <gtime> i'll try that beekir
[12:30:20] <gtime> will that work for dynamically loaded content u think?
[12:30:28] <beekir> that doesn't address any of hte problems you're having ;)  (I'm still digging!)  but it does help give you an idea of what you can do
[12:30:38] <gtime> ah yeah
[12:30:39] <beekir> yeah, as long as the id matches
[12:30:40] <gtime> for practice
[12:30:40] <gtime> thanks
[12:30:40] <rabbi1> shoky, just the order of elements are changed. here, first is radio button, next is label and then text box......
[12:31:04] <beekir> additionally, since find()/end() might be a little confusing, you could have just done your addClass().removeClass() before the .find()
[12:31:15] <shoky> still donno what you want. you know what to do..
[12:31:58] <beekir> gtime:  What's iindexlim supposed to do?
[12:32:06] <gtime> be an index limit
[12:32:07] <gtime> a number
[12:32:29] <gtime> a menu of gsubs and a menu of pages exist
[12:32:32] <gtime> and they have different items
[12:32:36] <beekir> there are jquery selectors for limiting based on index as well
[12:32:47] <beekir> (just trying to show you how you can get jquery to do the hard work for you)
[12:33:25] <gtime> which jquery selectors are for limiting?
[12:33:38] <beekir> all of them under the "selectors" section in the jquery docs :)
[12:33:59] <beekir> you probably want :lt()
[12:34:02] <gtime> they're for cycling through indicies?
[12:34:12] <beekir> no, they are for filtering your operations so they only hit the intended targets
[12:34:40] <beekir> if you are iterating over a list of objects and writing javascript to decide whether or not you want to manipulate said object, chances are you have mis-applied jquery in som eway
[12:34:51] <gtime> do all these document.getElementById calls take longer than using jquery selectors?
[12:35:10] <gtime> it's not a list of objects in the sense of an ol or ul
[12:35:13] <beekir> no....  document.getElementById is effing fast.  but $('#id') is the equivalent.
[12:35:14] <gtime> there's no li
[12:36:06] <gtime> anyway
[12:36:21] <beekir> gtime:  anyway, your code looks good.  i'm not sure why it's not working as expected.
[12:36:35] <beekir> Use a DOM inspector to verify the state of your nodes
[12:36:44] <beekir> i don't see a problem in your code.
[12:36:51] <beekir> just maybe behaving differently than what you expect
[12:37:28] <gtime> i was trying to replace those two functions with one
[12:37:30] <gtime> and it doesn't work at all
[12:37:43] <shoky> it give eror
[12:37:58] <gtime> it just doesn't change the fill colors or the classes
[12:38:10] <beekir> is "fill" a valid HTML attribute??
[12:38:33] <beekir> it sounds to me more like a CSS property.  one i am unfamiliar with...
[12:38:40] <raj> johnkpaul, I can't do a search for $select_temp.find(opt).remove() ?
[12:38:55] <johnkpaul> what is the type of opt?
[12:39:01] <johnkpaul> it should be a selector string
[12:39:04] <johnkpaul> ?find
[12:39:05] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[12:39:09] <gtime> this is for raphaeljs
[12:39:17] <raj> cuz there's obv a whole lotta other garble in jsfiddle
[12:39:38] <gtime> fill is valid for paths
[12:39:39] <raj> johnkpaul, i meant in console
[12:39:41] <gtime> svg paths
[12:39:56] <raj> there's a searchbox
[12:40:06] <raj> but it doesn't seem to find anythig inside the script
[12:40:29] <beekir> gtime:  i've never used svg, but what i'm reading at http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathElement does not show "fill" as an attribute for path elements
[12:40:34] <johnkpaul> raj: that console is in the window context
[12:40:39] <johnkpaul> there is no variable $select_temp there
[12:40:46] <gtime> beekir : it's valid, it works with the first function
[12:40:48] <johnkpaul> if you want to run code in that context, you need to put a breakpoint there
[12:40:50] <gtime> i mean the first thing i posted
[12:40:57] <beekir> well there it is
[12:41:17] <gtime> i'm just going to use ternery switches
[12:41:18] <beekir> "fill" is one of the core attributes they didn't list on that page
[12:41:20] <gtime> and bits
[12:41:39] <gtime> to see if i can get it to work with string literals
[12:41:41] <raj> oh
[12:41:41] <beekir> gtime:  walking away from a problem you don't understand does not help the situation :)
[12:41:50] <gtime> im testing to see if it's just a string problem
[12:42:13] <gtime> i suspect it has something to do with putting varliables into hasClass addClass removeClass all that
[12:42:14] <beekir> adios everybody.  thanks again for the help.
[12:42:40] <beekir> gtime:  be lazy.  alert() all the values of your arguments at the top of the function.  then you'll at least know what the strings are.
[12:43:37] <gtime> i did that
[12:44:26] <rabbi1> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/b2vbN/6/
[12:46:56] <shoky> rabbi1, http://jsfiddle.net/b2vbN/7/
[12:47:12] <shoky> .nextAll() with a selector
[12:47:13] <rabbi1> shoky: i actually tried doing it with attribute .. :(
[12:47:30] <shoky> dude.. your code still had prev() ....
[12:47:48] <rabbi1> shoky: ok nextAll is the key,
[12:47:51] <rabbi1> thank you
[12:48:13] <shoky> np
[12:48:24] <rabbi1> i got it back to prev
[12:48:44] <shoky> remember that inside the click handler,  'this' refers to the element that was clicked
[12:48:49] <rabbi1> but not nextAll
[12:48:57] <rabbi1> was tring with .next() only
[12:49:33] <shoky> yeah and if you read the API docs for .next() you'd see it only selects the one next sibling
[12:49:46] <rabbi1> means its a radio button which has clicked
[12:49:58] <shoky> indeed
[12:50:32] <rabbi1> i skipped nextall and went to attribute equals selector :(
[12:51:42] <rabbi1> shoky: thanks mate, had some good time learning jquery ....
[12:51:50] <rabbi1> shoky: c ya
[12:52:38] <shoky> seeya
[12:58:58] <gtime> hey how come
[12:58:59] <gtime> 		alert (i + ' and ' + 8-minusnum); 		alert (i + ' and ' + (8-minusnum));  		alert( i); 		alert (7-minusnum);
[12:59:03] <gtime> the first one says NaN
[12:59:06] <gtime> but the other ones work?
[12:59:23] <gtime> and minusnum was from function(stringvar,minusnum,stringvar2){
[13:04:47] <raj> johnkpaul, how can I find the line I want to find in the script?
[13:04:58] <raj> cuz jsfiddle has a million other lines of js
[13:05:11] <johnkpaul> you mean to add a breakpoint?
[13:05:20] <johnkpaul> you can use the search box on the top right of the dev tools
[13:05:25] <raj> yeah, i wanna find that line to add a breakpoint
[13:05:28] <johnkpaul> but I usually use the statement debuygger;
[13:05:34] <johnkpaul> which adds a breakpoint programatically
[13:05:41] <raj> oh, gotcha
[13:05:53] <raj> not sure how to do that in chrome
[13:06:00] <raj> watch expressions?
[13:06:16] <StevenCodes22> finally got my IRC back
[13:09:00] <johnkpaul> raj: howto do what?
[13:20:57] <johnkpaul> raj: http://vimeo.com/39112165
[13:23:07] <Whirl3d> i have to place a series of transparent png files on my page (absolutely positioned) so as to not have them overlap.  How do I do edge detection for an image when placing it?
[13:25:59] <tw2113> i'd probably grab the width of the images and then use the width for an offset
[13:27:52] <Whirl3d> tw2113, thanks for the reply. The problem is that I am loading a dozen or so images into a page to "popup" when a user mouses over them. My script works great except that two or three links close to each other spawn overlapping images.
[13:30:02] <raj> johnkpaul, thanks for the vid
[13:30:17] <Whirl3d> Here's the first draft. It's really rough, but it'll show what I am doing. If there's a better way, let me know.
[13:30:19] <johnkpaul> no problem, let me know if you have any questions about unit testing
[13:30:19] <raj> didn't realize you were a brownie
[13:30:19] <Whirl3d> http://www.paigeharvey.net/profile/africa.html'
[13:30:23] <raj> :)
[13:30:31] <johnkpaul> hahaha, yes, you can't tell by my name, but a brownie I am
[13:31:31] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: so what's the desired outcome?
[13:31:37] <johnkpaul> if they overlap...what should happen?
[13:32:26] <Whirl3d> I *can* live with the overlap, but I would love it if they spread out instead of overalpping. Lke at the bottom of the article with the bullets.
[13:32:53] <raj> johnkpaul, why do you look like you're in a doctor's exam room with an arcade?
[13:33:08] <johnkpaul> haha, becuase it was at a company called adcade
[13:33:12] <johnkpaul> so they have an arcade theme
[13:33:36] <raj> gotcha
[13:34:00] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: so you want an overlapping detection algorithm, and if you detect that they are overlapping, you'd handle that separately?
[13:34:32] <Whirl3d> ding, ding ding. On to the bonus round....that's what I meant to ask for.sorry.
[13:35:16] <johnkpaul> :) that's ok, I was wondeirng where edge detection comes in
[13:35:22] <johnkpaul> not that I'm an expert enough to really know the differnce
[13:35:46] <johnkpaul> but I thought that was for photographs to figure out where the prominent parts are
[13:35:53] <Whirl3d> I was struggling to find the correct way to ask the question. So I figured edge detection would also include overlay
[13:36:38] <Whirl3d> you said exactly what I was looking for..I just couldn't get it to come out right..
[13:37:00] <johnkpaul> ah ok
[13:37:09] <johnkpaul> so I don't know of the optimal solution for this
[13:37:21] <johnkpaul> I am not really enough of a algorithmist to tell you that the nieve solution is good or bad
[13:37:27] <johnkpaul> since you only have 4, I don't think it matters
[13:38:07] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5720837/how-to-detect-elements-overlapping-overlaying-using-javascript
[13:38:29] <johnkpaul> I don't know if you can take that exactly, but that will get you on the right track to detecting if there is overlap
[13:38:38] <johnkpaul> once that returns true, you need to handle your logic how ever you want
[13:39:30] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, thanks so much. I am sure I can get close from there. I really appreciate it.
[13:39:47] <johnkpaul> no problem! have fun.
[13:40:40] <raj> johnkpaul, my watch expression didn't catch
[13:40:41] <raj> http://vimeo.com/39112165
[13:40:43] <raj> oops
[13:40:59] <raj> $select_temp.find(opt).remove()
[13:41:40] <johnkpaul> when you say watch expression, do you mean breakpoint?
[13:42:16] <raj> i dunno, chrome has a "watch expression", I thought that was the programmatic breakpoint
[13:42:20] <johnkpaul> did you use the debugger; statement or are you using the chrome dev tools panel
[13:42:21] <johnkpaul> no
[13:42:26] <johnkpaul> a programtic breakpoint is to add the line
[13:42:28] <johnkpaul> debugger;
[13:42:29] <johnkpaul> in your code
[13:42:37] <raj> oh
[13:43:08] <raj> what line do I put in the code?
[13:43:12] <raj> to break it
[13:43:47] <johnkpaul> what do you mean?
[13:43:51] <johnkpaul> try watching this screen cast
[13:43:51] <johnkpaul> http://jqueryfordesigners.com/debugging-tools/
[13:43:58] <johnkpaul> it's in firebug not chrome
[13:44:01] <johnkpaul> but the ideas are really similar
[13:45:28] <Advocated> any reason why $("#client").attr("visibility", "visible"); would not make my div visible, when i've got: <div id="client" style="width:200px;height:200px;visibility:hidden;"> ?
[13:46:20] <johnkpaul> ?css @Advocated
[13:46:21] <bot-t> Advocated, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[13:46:29] <johnkpaul> switch attr with css
[13:46:31] <johnkpaul> and you should be good
[13:47:22] <Advocated> johnkpaul, awesomeness trhanks :)
[13:47:48] <johnkpaul> no problem
[13:53:04] <Whirl3d> so when I click on one of these popup image links (or on it's image since it's a child of the link), I call the toggleImage function. It immediately hides the image if visible and add the "disabled" class to the image. But it doesn't work for some reason. It won't do the hide part?
[13:53:56] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: what's the live page again?
[13:54:08] <Whirl3d> though I can log right before the "hideimage" aniamtion and sure enough, it's getting there. It's just not hiding.
[13:54:13] <Whirl3d> one sex
[13:54:17] <Whirl3d> *sec
[13:54:55] <Whirl3d> http://paigeharvey.net/profile/africa.html
[13:55:59] <johnkpaul> in what case is it not hiding?
[13:56:32] <johnkpaul> I keep getting "why isn't it hidden" in the console
[13:56:36] <Whirl3d> when you click the link, it's supposed to diable the image
[13:56:37] <johnkpaul> but the element goes away
[13:56:43] <johnkpaul> ah
[13:56:45] <johnkpaul> click
[13:56:58] <Whirl3d> I use the same hide function, just no delay
[13:57:11] <Whirl3d> and yet it doesn't apply without the delay.
[13:58:27] <Whirl3d> I tried using .on to be sure to grab the clicks from the image as well as the link, but I should have handled the entire thing in .on instead of using the shortcuts. I'll proably just make one handler for the page actually
[13:59:44] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: it has something to do with your timers
[13:59:52] <johnkpaul> animate isn't synchronous
[14:00:10] <johnkpaul> so when you call animate(), the animation doesn't happen immedaitely, it's queued up to progress in the future
[14:00:14] <Whirl3d> but I clear the timers each time
[14:00:21] <Whirl3d> I have queue:false
[14:00:42] <johnkpaul> hm
[14:00:45] <Whirl3d> and I'm manually using the timers, not the built-in delay method
[14:00:50] <Whirl3d> so it should be related
[14:01:15] <johnkpaul> so queue false doesn't mean that it's synchronous
[14:01:20] <johnkpaul> it still uses setTimeout internally
[14:01:55] <johnkpaul> it just means that it shouldn't use the effects queue, in case you want to hve some animations run at the same time
[14:02:54] <Whirl3d> but it's a different namespace that the timeout I am clearning, tight?
[14:03:10] <johnkpaul> :/ working with timeouts like this is very difficult to reason about
[14:03:18] <stamp> Hi
[14:03:37] <stamp> I need some help with .text function
[14:03:59] <stamp> i have item in <li>
[14:04:35] <stamp> and .text() returns whates beetwen <li></li> with \n appended
[14:04:47] <maelp_> hello, could you help me with the following: I want that when a user presses '/' on the page it gets caught in a "global handler" and the search box gets focused on, but then when he types in the box, the "global handler" does not get called (eg. it directly go to the input box)
[14:05:24] <stamp> for example like this "\n           Account director "
[14:05:29] <maelp_> how can I do this? i've tried $('body').on('keypress', globalHandler) and $('input').on('keydown', filterList)
[14:05:39] <maelp_> where filterList would stop the event bubbling
[14:05:43] <hagabaka> I'm trying to get a grid-table which I can edit by cell, add/remove columns, and examine values as a nested array. Is there a plugin that does those and as few other things as possible?
[14:05:50] <Whirl3d> Found it
[14:05:55] <maelp_> but when I type in the filterList, it bubbles to the globalHandler :(
[14:06:26] <maelp_> no one has an idea?
[14:06:27] <Whirl3d> in my toggle function, I check if the img is visible. If not, I hide it and forget to return
[14:06:32] <Whirl3d> so, the next statement says, if it's disabled, enable it and show it
[14:06:35] <Whirl3d> lol
[14:06:41] <Whirl3d> Thanks for your help, johnkpaul
[14:06:49] <johnkpaul> :) glad you figured it out, no problem
[14:07:01] <johnkpaul> stamp: look into String.prototype.trim
[14:07:47] <johnkpaul> maelp_: do you really not want it to get to the global handler, or do you just not want the global handler to respond to it in a certain way
[14:07:59] <johnkpaul> you can just check, in the global handler, event.originalTarget == event.target
[14:08:32] <maelp_> hum.. well I guess if I can avoid the bubble up it would be more efficient right
[14:08:47] <maelp_> but I can also do event.originalTarget
[14:09:10] <maelp_> the thing is I don't understand why the event bubbles up although my "filter handle"r returns false
[14:09:28] <maelp_> isn't it supposed to stop bubbling?
[14:09:58] <johnkpaul> ?stopPropagation @maelp_
[14:10:08] <bot-t> maelp_, event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[14:10:17] <johnkpaul> try that
[14:10:23] <maelp_> johnkpaul: you don't know how I can stop the event propagation?
[14:10:36] <johnkpaul> what do you mean?
[14:10:43] <maelp_> well
[14:10:58] <maelp_> I guess that returning false from the handler is the same as calling e.stopPropagation no?
[14:11:13] <raj> why would prototype decide to use the $?
[14:11:24] <johnkpaul> prototype came first raj
[14:11:32] <raj> oh
[14:11:34] <johnkpaul> :)
[14:11:40] <raj> then why the hell would jquery decide to?
[14:11:54] <maelp_> johnkpaul: in the page it says "These handlers, therefore, may prevent the delegated handler from triggering by calling event.stopPropagation() or returning false. "
[14:11:55] <johnkpaul> maelp_: yes, I thought that returning false is the same as e.stopPropagation() and e.preventDefault()
[14:12:02] <johnkpaul> but I like being more explicit about it
[14:12:16] <johnkpaul> maelp_: yeah, then I don't know, do you have a live example?
[14:12:22] <maelp_> exactly, so this won't work..
[14:12:33] <johnkpaul> raj: because it's a useful one character convention and they had jQuery.noConflict()
[14:12:41] <johnkpaul> Prototype was a little annoying in how many globals it created
[14:12:47] <johnkpaul> but I'm a fan nonetheless
[14:13:37] <raj> interesting
[14:14:45] <maelp_> johnkpaul: yeah but the one is quite involved check http://playwr.it/
[14:14:52] <maelp_> johnkpaul: if you press '/' on the page it focuses on the input
[14:15:10] <maelp_> johnkpaul: use f12 to show the console and it logs the keypresses
[14:15:21] <maelp_> johnkpaul: when you type in the filter it should not go to the global handler
[14:16:09] <stamp> johnkpaul, found $.trim() which works greate
[14:16:17] <johnkpaul> oh, is this a CS app? maelp_
[14:20:44] <maelp_> johnkpaul: it is done with backbone
[14:20:45] <maelp_> oh yeah with coffeescript :)
[14:20:54] <maelp_> johnkpaul: okay I figured it out
[14:21:23] <maelp_> johnkpaul: it is because I was stopping the  propagation of keyup in one case and  listening to  keypress in the other ! :)
[14:21:55] <maelp_> johnkpaul: http://jsfiddle.net/ydLyz/
[14:39:39] <raj> johnkpaul, thanks for the links
[14:39:42] <raj> i'll bbl
[14:39:47] <raj> still watching the vids
[14:41:17] <maelp_> hello, another question: I have an input and I want to have its value on a keypress event, but if I use $('input').val() in the handler it gives me the old value (before the key has been pressed)
[14:41:18] <johnkpaul> no problem, glad you're finding it useful
[14:41:22] <maelp_> how can I get the correct value? :)
[14:41:36] <johnkpaul> maelp_: use keyup would do it
[14:41:55] <johnkpaul> or you could concatenate .val() and event.keyCode's mapping
[14:42:09] <maelp_> johnkpaul: yeah but that's complex if the keypress was a backspace :(
[14:42:44] <johnkpaul> hm, or a control key
[14:43:09] <maelp_> johnkpaul: there is no event that returns the correct keyCode but after it has been updated? (like when I press '/', if I listen to keyup I will get two key codes, one for the shift and the other for the key)
[14:43:38] <johnkpaul> what do you mean? that is the correct keycode
[14:43:50] <johnkpaul> unless there's a plugin out there for this, you're probably going to habve to write it yourself
[14:44:40] <maelp_> johnkpaul: I would like my filter handler not to be called each time I press "shift" for isntance
[14:45:12] <maelp_> johnkpaul: so only on a "keypress" event, so when the key "A" has been pressed I have only one event, and not a shift and a a
[14:45:36] <johnkpaul> hm, yeah, I know what you mean, but I don't really know much about how to handle it
[14:45:44] <johnkpaul> String.fromCharCode could help
[14:45:46] <maelp_>  okay:)
[15:24:46] <erebel55> lo
[15:25:26] <erebel55> does anyone know why my border isn't showing up? http://jsfiddle.net/r9fRx/17/
[15:28:00] <Sean-Der> I am using JSON and the API I am working with has - as one of its outputs
[15:28:30] <Sean-Der> Does anyone know of a way I could replace this or expect in somehow?
[15:28:59] <johnkpaul> erebel55: I assume that you can't add a border to a element within an svg
[15:29:07] <johnkpaul> because css doens't apply
[15:29:16] <erebel55> yeah, i must have to use stroke
[15:30:13] <erebel55> johnkpaul: thanks
[15:36:04] <johnkpaul> erebel55: np
[15:39:32] <erebel55> hm but now actually changing the style of the svg is beyond me
[15:41:37] <johnkpaul> erebel55: the style attribute has "stroke:rgb(whatever)"
[15:41:50] <johnkpaul> hmm, I wonder if the jquery css method would work if you used stroke
[15:42:09] <johnkpaul> have you looked into http://keith-wood.name/svg.html
[15:42:23] <erebel55> yeah, i'm trying to avoid it
[15:42:39] <johnkpaul> oh, well then look into that coede to see how it does it
[15:42:55] <erebel55> hmm ok
[15:44:21] <zfmf> which selector i have to use, when i want only the first level children
[15:44:42] <dabear_> zfmf: >
[15:44:50] <dabear_> #foo>div
[15:46:09] <wroathe> There are a number of ways I've been thinking about handling conditional logic to display form elements depending on the value of a select input... I'm curious if any of you know of an elegant way to do it?
[15:46:52] <wroathe> I tried delegating the change event to an onChange event handler and using a switch case based on the current value but then you wind up with a lot of repetition.
[15:47:40] <zfmf> dabear_:  yea thanks so it works :D jQuery("ul#navicat > li.dropdown >ul").addClass('children2'); ;)
[15:56:45] <blendedbychris> can anyone point me to the right direction to implement push notifications for a chat?
[15:57:58] <erebel55> does anyone know how i can toggle this border back off when the user clicks "off" the svg? http://jsfiddle.net/r9fRx/22/
[15:58:15] <erebel55> or hide it, either way
[16:00:02] <johnkpaul-afk> ?toggle @erebel55
[16:00:02] <bot-t> erebel55, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[16:01:51] <erebel55> oh wow thanks again johnkpaul-afk
[16:06:10] <erebel55> but toggle is for when you want two different functions to run when clicking on the same item twice right?
[16:06:17] <erebel55> hm maybe i need to read more
[16:11:39] <erebel55> danggit it doesn't seem to work with items within an svg http://jsfiddle.net/r9fRx/23/
[16:14:40] <erebel55> i think what i really want to do is be able to read a click that is somewhere besides the svg
[16:16:04] <Eviltwin> ?g jquery outside events @ erebel55
[16:16:05] <bot-t> erebel55, Ben Alman  jQuery outside events: Why trigger an event on ... - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/
[16:23:02] <erebel55> Eviltwin: thank you. why hasn't that been adopted into the core?
[16:25:49] <dabear_> erebel55: because it isn't needed inside the core
[16:26:53] <erebel55> ahh ok
[16:55:43] <raj> 3 days, haven't solved my script's issues =T
[17:22:38] <Lonestar99> howdy folks trying to send 5 parameters using jsonp is that possible?
[17:31:36] <kurol> 5? why not 6?
[17:32:03] <raj> superfluous
[17:32:33] <kurol> inconceivable!
[17:33:17] <Lonestar99> not sure ok will start with 2 parameters
[17:34:32] <Lonestar99> need to send cross domain index.php?e=1234&foo=abc   via  jsonp --> is that possible?
[17:35:06] <kurol> yeah, it's just a url
[17:37:49] <Lonestar99> i have the following --> http://pastebin.com/9SUU3Zq3
[17:40:05] <Eviltwin> Does your PHP speak JSONP?
[17:41:24] <Tee_Pee> evenin'
[17:41:33] <raj> anyone interested in making a quick $50 writing a script? (or fixing mine)
[17:41:48] <Lonestar99> Eviltwin: yeah
[17:42:05] <Tee_Pee> I have a small issue, was hoping someone would be bored enough to help me out here
[17:42:51] <Tee_Pee> I have a floating menu, and a button associated with said menu... via javascript, I changed the menu's display to block or hidden when the user enters / leaves the button respectively
[17:43:16] <Tee_Pee> The issue being that now the menu disappears if the user tries to click something on it, as he has to leave the button to do that
[17:43:33] <Tee_Pee> I feel as if there's a simple way to fix this, but I can't think of anything
[17:43:34] <Lonestar99> Eviltwin: jquery and php working, just do not know how to pass parameters via the code I supplied
[17:43:55] <Whirl3d> How can I write a plugin that would determine if two elements overlapped (either completely, partially, or not) for each axis...? I've started, but it seems like a ton of code for something so simple.
[17:44:31] <Tee_Pee> Object overlap has never been simple in any form I've have had the pleasure of doing it...
[17:44:37] <Tee_Pee> Java, C#, Flash
[17:44:54] <Tee_Pee> especially if you're looking at pixel-perfect overlap
[17:44:59] <Tee_Pee> rather than box overlap
[17:45:03] <Tee_Pee> in which case it's relatively simple
[17:49:58] <PressedWeb> how do I target a few elements at once?
[17:50:06] <PressedWeb> Like $(this) and $('#foo') ?
[17:50:18] <PressedWeb> Like $(this, #foo).fadeOut();
[17:51:24] <Lonestar99> +
[17:52:16] <Whirl3d> Tee_Pee, thanks for the reply if not for the hope. LOL don't need pixel perfect, just box is fine. I am curently checking each corner against it's target's corner. It's a lot of steps.
[17:52:26] <jackfranklin> PressedWeb
[17:52:31] <jackfranklin> $(this).add("#foo")
[17:52:38] <jackfranklin> would give you a collection with this & #foo
[17:52:50] <jackfranklin> PressedWeb $(this).add("#foo").fadeOut() should work
[17:53:04] <jackfranklin> http://api.jquery.com/add/
[17:54:36] <Lonestar99> can anyone help me with jsonp?
[17:54:54] <jackfranklin> I can try :)
[17:56:11] <Lonestar99> need to pass some parameters via jsonp (cross-domain)  -->http://pastebin.com/9SUU3Zq3
[17:56:45] <jackfranklin> is that working?
[17:57:03] <jackfranklin> i presume not
[17:57:11] <StevenCodes22> whatup
[17:57:20] <PressedWeb> jackfranklin: Thanks man! :)
[17:57:53] <jackfranklin> Lonestar99 does that code work at the moment?
[17:57:56] <jackfranklin> PressedWeb you're welcome :)
[17:58:01] <StevenCodes22> two birds one stone jackfranklin  ;)
[17:58:14] <Lonestar99> jackfranklin: yes it does work
[17:58:25] <jackfranklin> awesome, so what's the issue? :)
[17:58:34] <StevenCodes22> should I make a service bot to record help ? hmm
[18:00:17] <Lonestar99> jackfranklin:  want to pass   index.php?e=1234&foo=abc via jsonp
[18:00:45] <Lonestar99> so that php code can process the parameters
[18:01:07] <jackfranklin> setting the data property to an object should do that
[18:01:22] <jackfranklin> so data: {id: id, foo: "abc"}
[18:01:29] <jackfranklin> jQuery should serialize that in the request
[18:01:48] <Lonestar99> jackfranklin: ok let me that
[18:01:58] <jackfranklin> from the docs Lonestar99 : "Data to be sent to the server. It is converted to a query string, if not already a string. It's appended to the url for GET-requests. See processData option to prevent this automatic processing. Object must be Key/Value pairs."
[18:04:10] <Lonestar99> jackfranklin: i actually read that, but did not make sense until now...
[18:04:32] <jackfranklin> yeah it's slightly confusing
[18:07:08] <Lonestar99> jackfranklin:  hmmm... works, but php not doing anything parameters...
[18:07:17] <jackfranklin> what do you mean Lonestar99 ?
[18:07:24] <jackfranklin> "php not doing anything parameters" ?
[18:07:58] <Lonestar99> let me pastebin...
[18:09:48] <Lonestar99> jackfranklin: http://pastebin.com/xbjR3aNk
[18:10:19] <jackfranklin> Lonestar99 this is wrong: $b = trim($_GET['$b']);
[18:10:25] <jackfranklin> should be $b = trim ($_GET['b']);
[18:12:10] <Lonestar99> lol, my bad...
[18:12:44] <jackfranklin> ahh I've made that mistake plenty of times ;)
[18:13:05] <Lonestar99> yeah, that was it... lol
[18:16:06] <Lonestar99> jackfranklin:  thanks 4 your help
[18:16:12] <jackfranklin> np
[18:24:04] <ggherdov> hi all. how do I get all keys from an array ?
[18:24:26] <systemfault> ggherdov: They're from 0 to .length - 1?
[18:24:39] <systemfault> Or you mean the keys of an object?
[18:24:45] <Lonestar99> jackfranklin:  ok now need to make sure i am parsing title correctly...  LINE 7 http://pastebin.com/DHv6NTNX
[18:25:07] <ggherdov> array in the sense of hash table systemfault
[18:25:14] <ggherdov> (associative array)
[18:25:23] <systemfault> ggherdov: That only makes sense for a PHP programmer..
[18:25:28] <systemfault> Anyway..
[18:25:41] <johnkpaul-afk> ?map
[18:25:42] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[18:25:43] <systemfault> ggherdov: You would use the "for in" operator
[18:25:47] <jackfranklin> Lonestar99 I don't think that's right, as basresult is an array (even though it's an array of just 1 item) so I think you'd need to do rtndata.response.basresult[0].title
[18:26:05] <ggherdov> systemfault: thx
[18:26:07] <johnkpaul-afk> ggherdov: you can use jQUery.map
[18:26:18] <ggherdov> johnkpaul-afk: thx
[18:26:28] <Lonestar99> jackfranklin:  oh ok
[18:26:40] <johnkpaul-afk> ?eval $({"key1":"test"}).map(function(val,key){return key});
[18:26:42] <bot-t> johnkpaul-afk: [[object Object]]
[18:28:27] <systemfault> ?eval $.map({"key1": "test"}, function(_, k){ return k; });
[18:28:27] <bot-t> systemfault: []
[18:28:46] <johnkpaul-afk> ?
[18:28:53] <johnkpaul-afk> that's not what I was expecting
[18:30:35] <systemfault> ?eval var x = []; $.each({"key1": "test"}, function(_, k){ x.push(k); }); x;
[18:30:35] <bot-t> systemfault: ["test"]
[18:30:55] <systemfault> I wish we could safely use all of ES5 everywhere..
[18:31:14] <systemfault> ?eval Object.keys({"key1":"test"});
[18:31:14] <bot-t> systemfault: TypeError: Object.keys is not a function
[18:31:25] <systemfault> Ah.. the bot doesn't like ES5
[18:31:34] <johnkpaul-afk> systemfault: the bot is pretty far behind
[18:31:38] <johnkpaul-afk> ?eval $().jquery
[18:31:38] <bot-t> johnkpaul-afk: "1.4.2"
[18:31:48] <jackfranklin> oh dear the bot needs updating
[18:31:49] <jackfranklin> lol
[18:32:09] <Lonestar99> jackfranklin: did not work...
[18:32:19] <jackfranklin> did you get an error Lonestar99 ?
[18:32:59] <Hierofant> Hi, anyone here dev on a mac?  Looking for recs for mac text editors with syntax highlighting etc
[18:33:31] <systemfault> Hierofant: The classic on mac is Textmate... but there are others.
[18:33:36] <kategeek> bbedit, sublime, vim

[18:33:49] <jackfranklin> Hierofant I personally use Vim but I've heard good things about Textmate, Espresso, Coda, Sublime Text 2
[18:33:59] <systemfault> I love vim :)
[18:34:03] <johnkpaul-afk> vim++
[18:34:12] <jackfranklin> Lonestar99 if you console.log rtndata.response.basresult what do you get>
[18:34:15] <jackfranklin> ? *
[18:38:20] <jackfranklin> loving all the Vim support too :D
[18:38:48] <Lonestar99> jackfranklin: getting a syntax error with   console.log rtndata.response.basresult
[18:38:57] <jackfranklin> you need brackets
[18:39:05] <jackfranklin> console.log(rtndata.response.basresult);
[18:39:19] <jackfranklin> then load up the web developer tools, head to the console, and see what's outputted
[18:40:13] <Lonestar99> 'k
[18:41:34] <jackfranklin> Lonestar99 for me doing rtn.dataresponse.basresult[0].title works
[18:41:38] <jackfranklin> sorry
[18:41:44] <jackfranklin> rtndata.response.basresult[0].title * Lonestar99
[18:42:12] <Lonestar99> k i think i found a problem
[18:45:04] <jackfranklin> Lonestar99 i have to head off, sorry, I'm sure someone else here will be able to assist, good luck :)
[18:45:18] <Lonestar99> ok
[18:52:54] <Whirl3d> so, I'm about to start trying to decipher the jqueryUI draggable/droppable methods and was wondering if anyyone had some advice about/insider insights that could help on the study?
[19:00:35] <kisielk> is there a way to return data for multiple elements?
[19:00:42] <kisielk> from a data-foo attribute
[19:00:57] <kisielk> seems calling .data("foo") only returns one
[19:02:22] <Whirl3d> ?.map
[19:02:22] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[19:03:52] <Whirl3d> so, you could use a map function (which returns your value) and then .get to grab it. Like $(list).map(function () {return ($(this).data("foo");}).get();
[19:05:20] <kisielk> ah
[19:05:25] <kisielk> how is map different from each?
[19:06:20] <Whirl3d> each applys a transform to each element or something. but doesn't return a value. .map returns a value
[19:31:00] <Lonestar99> how do I get the what text inside a div? <div id="bb">hello world</div> --> $('#bb').html(); ??
[19:48:06] <Whirl3d> .text()
[19:49:18] <Lonestar99> want to parse more than one result from the following --> http://pastebin.com/JEm06uBN
[19:51:33] <Whirl3d> are you using $.parseJSON?
[19:53:14] <Lonestar99> Whirl3d:  i guess not...
[19:54:31] <Lonestar99> Whirl3d:  from the code in pastebin it works, but only get one result...
[19:55:35] <Whirl3d> This is gonna sound rude, but if it's not working (except for one result), it's not working...
[19:55:53] <Whirl3d> it sounds like you ned to parse the JSON into objects then map the objects to get your results
[19:56:51] <Whirl3d> var objectList=$.parseJSON(bas); var results=$.map(objectList, function () { return (this.title;}); $("something")>html(results);
[19:56:58] <Lonestar99> Whirl3d:  i meant not getting errors,  but yeah not working... yeah that is what it seems like
[19:57:08] <Whirl3d> *.html(results);   sorry
[19:57:13] <Lonestar99> yeah
[19:57:35] <Lonestar99> have done this in prototype but not using prototype in this project...
[19:57:58] <Whirl3d> did you try my solution?
[19:58:26] <Lonestar99> oh yeah trying right now
[20:05:30] <Lonestar99> Whirl3d:  getting -->  [Break On This Error]  length = elems.length,
[20:06:04] <tash> anyone around used the jquery modal form?
[20:08:10] <Meekohi> How do I call a jqueryUI widget's _destroy method?
[20:09:55] <Meekohi> or should it be destroy() ?
[20:12:05] <Lonestar99> elems is null
[20:12:20] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/xjpqc/6/
[20:12:37] <Whirl3d> sorry, you don't need to parse the JSON, you just need to map the results
[20:15:32] <Lonestar99> Whirl3d:  ok let me check it out thanks
[20:18:06] <dwarder> i've called a function upon onMouseOver event, how do i add a class to element that was mouse overed?
[20:18:14] <dwarder> $(this).addClass?
[20:18:28] <dwarder> from withing the function?
[20:19:26] <systemfault> tias :P
[20:20:59] <dwarder> systemfault: i believe that making fun of people is ok unless you help them in some way afterwards
[20:21:21] <dwarder> unless = as long as
[20:21:37] <dwarder> and i'm not an american
[20:21:50] <systemfault> dwarder: I'm not making fun of you at all..
[20:22:18] <systemfault> dwarder: But don't you think it might be a good idea to at least TRY IT YOURSELF and see if it works before asking us?
[20:22:54] <systemfault> And I'm not an american either..
[20:23:03] <dwarder> ohh, i've read the acronim wrong
[20:23:05] <systemfault> I'm canadian-french
[20:23:41] <systemfault> TIAS means Try It And See :)
[20:24:02] <dwarder> "Typical Ignorant American"
[20:24:06] <Lonestar99> Whirl3d:  ok great! thanks
[20:24:08] <dwarder> what google answered :)
[20:24:21] <systemfault> Haha
[20:24:49] <dwarder> well it doesn' work
[20:25:04] <dwarder> i.e. http://jsfiddle.net/ByJbY/2/
[20:25:14] <systemfault> dwarder: As for the answer, it's probably something like:  $(yourElement).on('mouseover', function(){ $(this).addClass('lol'); });
[20:25:52] <systemfault> dwarder: Nobody uses inline-events anymore...
[20:26:02] <systemfault> It's the old and unflexible way.
[20:26:16] <systemfault> dwarder: http://jsfiddle.net/wHSWN/
[20:26:47] <dwarder> yes, i know it is not unobtrusive
[20:27:12] <Whirl3d> if it's just adding styling, you could just use the pseudo :hover class.
[20:27:16] <systemfault> True :D
[20:27:24] <Whirl3d> *.css class
[20:27:47] <dwarder> not just styling, it is part of a code
[20:28:01] <dwarder> i.e. model
[20:28:15] <dwarder> of a real code
[20:28:25] <dwarder> systemfault: thanks
[20:31:13] <dwarder> actualy it is an old code
[20:31:17] <dwarder> that i need to modify
[20:31:27] <dwarder> and it is using this obtrusive style
[20:31:49] <dwarder> and i can't figure why it doesn't work
[20:32:05] <dwarder> i.e. in my jsfiddle with obtrusive style onmouseover
[20:32:40] <dwarder> well, i just rewrite it
[20:32:48] <dwarder> to unobtrusive style
[20:39:26] <tash> this is how to get the value, or input you've typed into a textbox right? var jobtype = $("#jobtype").val();
[20:39:34] <tash> assuming jobtype is the ID
[20:41:34] <jrockjiggz> tash: yep
[20:43:31] <tash> hrm
[20:43:40] <tash> i must not be setting something up right
[20:47:12] <tash> on click of a button I
[20:47:15] <tash> errr
[20:47:23] <Whirl3d> how does .before work? i have a custom select field that if you choose the "custom" value, it gives you an input field to type in your value and then it is supposed to append it to the selectField just before the "other" option
[20:47:37] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/xjpqc/16/
[20:47:53] <Whirl3d> I've tried it without appending it and it disappears...
[20:47:58] <tash> on click of a button I'm having a modal form open up, when I click on the submit button, I'd like to submit the values I've entered for the inputs, but I can't seem to get those values
[20:48:12] <tash> i'm wondering if maybe I'm creating the vars in the wrong place
[20:48:45] <tash> http://pastie.org/3663973
[20:49:06] <tash> see ^^ I'm setting the vars above the .dialog ... can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong?
[20:49:45] <tash> note that when I click on the "Add" button that is in the modal form, I am trying to alert the values of the inputs, but they are all blank except the one I'm setting with some php
[20:51:31] <Whirl3d> what is that on line 10?
[20:53:12] <tash> zend framework stuff, I passed the job number to this page, you can ignore it really
[20:53:27] <tash> didn't even need to put it in the pastie...I'm concerned about how to get the input values into a var
[20:53:32] <Lonestar99> Whirl3d:  what if I want to parse the "title" and "basummary" do i write a function for each?
[20:55:55] <Whirl3d> Lonestar99, the map function lets you do whatever you want and return a value. So if you want both values in the same function, put return them both.
[20:56:21] <Whirl3d> But it you need them at separate times, map them separately
[20:56:56] <Lonestar99> Whirl3d:  at the same time...
[20:57:08] <tash> Whirl3d: got any tips for me?
[20:57:08] <Whirl3d> tash, I don't know about your dialog plugin, so it's not really easy to divine...
[20:58:38] <tash> ok
[20:59:49] <Whirl3d> first of all tash, line 10 has to throw an error. Try setting this up in jsfiddle where you can get a working model to manipulate
[21:01:13] <ButterSpread> anyone wanna spread mt butter
[21:01:16] <ButterSpread> lmao
[21:03:12] <Lonestar99> Whirl3d:  can use "map" more than once in a single function?
[21:04:07] <Whirl3d> What do you mean?
[21:05:10] <Whirl3d> Lonestar, what are you actually trying to accomplish with this json text? Maybe there's an easier way.
[21:06:06] <Lonestar99> looking at docs and the thing is i want to parse  "title", "basummary", "longurl" in the same function,  looking at map examples i can only map one per function?
[21:06:46] <Whirl3d> what do you want to do with those values? They are already assigned to the response object
[21:06:54] <Whirl3d> but what do you want to do with them?
[21:07:24] <Lonestar99> i want to send the html() or text() to a div...

[21:15:42] <Lonestar99> Whirl3d: ok thanks, looking over code to see if i understand what it is doing =)
[21:17:35] <Whirl3d> I could have used another map function to get the propeties out as well. Not sure which is faster/better
[21:18:42] <Lonestar99> Whirl3d:  properties of each attribute?
[21:23:40] <Whirl3d> for example, if you knew that all the objects contained the same properties, rather than "for prop in elem" you could use $.map(propertyList, function (prop, id) { return (elem[prop]);})
[21:24:10] <Whirl3d> or something similar...(I'm sure I bungled the ()}s in there, but you get the idea
[21:25:10] <sgo11> hi, a newbie question. I defined a variable globally like var name = 'something'. then I use this variable name inside a get function $.get(...) {name = 'something else'}. but out of the function, the new value assigned inside get function gets lost. something to do with namespace. can anyone tell me how can I create a global string and alter it inside a function? thanks.
[21:28:53] <Lonestar99> Whirl3d:  it should work fine if only one result is returned right?
[21:29:48] <Lonestar99> yeah. just tested
[21:33:54] <sgo11> just ignore my question. I used another workaround.
[21:35:42] <Lonestar99> how many years has jsonp been available? since like 2009?
[21:36:07] <systemfault> Lonestar99: Since forever.. it's a hack
[21:36:24] <systemfault> Lonestar99: See by yourself how is that hack working.
[21:36:29] <systemfault> (Google)
[21:41:03] <Lonestar99> systemfault:  really, like in 2009 or 2010 searched for days for javascript and cross domain stuff, but found nothing
[21:41:26] <Lonestar99> other than it was not allowed by browsers...
[21:41:35] <ruby_on_tails> if i dump the browser width on an iphone will it give me 320px or a lot more due to the resolution ?
[21:41:37] <systemfault> It's still not allowed without CORS.
[21:42:09] <systemfault> Lonestar99: (CORS is fairly new, JSONP isn't)
[21:43:21] <systemfault> Lonestar99: JSONP isn't really JSON, it's Javascript.
[21:43:59] <systemfault> It's uses the fact that you can download a script from an external domain without problem.
[21:46:47] <Lonestar99> systemfault:  what json does not allow is "requesting" data sources from remote systems  right?
[21:47:34] <systemfault> Lonestar99: What you call JSON is actually an XMLHttpRequest.. and you cannot request anything from another domain with it.
[21:47:59] <systemfault> JSONP uses a <script> element so it can work everywhere.. BUT
[21:48:26] <systemfault> JSONP is quite limited, you only have access to the GET HTTP verb with it
[21:48:37] <systemfault> XHR.. you have access to all of them.
[21:50:14] <Lonestar99> systemfault:  ok if i am only requesting JSON from one web service which works with JSONP, i should not have any problems with any browsers right?
[21:50:43] <systemfault> Lonestar99: Will be fine :P On any browser that supports <script> :P
[21:53:31] <Lonestar99> sweet...
[22:09:15] <Anphonic> Why is my img not loading in this? http://jsfiddle.net/vpydj/
[22:09:37] <Anphonic> and good evening :)
[22:12:36] <Whirl3d> Anphonic, it's because you define the variable $radarImg inside your callback for the ajax call.
[22:15:44] <Anphonic> ah ok, so it i define it prior and only assign it, it should work? might be confused with that since the temp zip and observation dates update properly
[22:17:01] <Whirl3d> $radarImg will work fine inside the callback (like those other properties) but you can't access it outside of the callback.
[22:17:48] <Whirl3d> in your success callbback, $radarImg is defined and prolly has the correct url. But as soon as you leave the success callback, it is erased because you defined it local to the success callback.
[22:18:16] <Whirl3d> So, perhaps you men to move the line where you assign the src attr to the img INSIDE your callback
[22:18:21] <Whirl3d> then you image should update
[22:18:44] <Anphonic> it is setting $radarImg as the img src but not actually being displayed. you can look at the output html and it has <img src="value" />
[22:19:49] <Anphonic> i had added the attr line as a test, just forgot to pull that out
[22:21:22] <Whirl3d> Where is the image?
[22:21:33] <Whirl3d> Oh I see in the text
[22:21:56] <Anphonic> yeah, i updated http://jsfiddle.net/vpydj/3/ without the $('img') call
[22:27:02] <Whirl3d> got it
[22:27:12] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/vpydj/5/
[22:27:16] <Anphonic> something stupid simple?
[22:27:18] <Anphonic> kk looking
[22:27:48] <Whirl3d> you have to create the image element rather than just assigning the html with the element defined in it.
[22:28:16] <Anphonic> ah ok, chalk that up to my limited jquery/js knowledge
[22:28:56] <Anphonic> tyvm Whirl3d
[22:29:00] <Whirl3d> np
[22:29:27] <Whirl3d> Anybody know an easy way to check a select field for an existing value?
[22:29:54] <mtime> hi can u guys help me?
[22:29:54] <mtime> hi, im trying to write to change these two functions so that the callajax function can accept parameterized functions to pass to the ajxmstrcl function so that these parameterized functions will be executed somewhere in the `success:' of the ajax call ( http://pastebin.com/iBGSQLDY )
[22:30:21] <Anphonic> next mission s to delve into the wunderground api more and figure out how to overlay wundermap over a hybrid google map
[22:33:38] <RealityBall> hello
[22:33:41] <RealityBall> I'm just curious
[22:33:49] <RealityBall> are jquery and javascript interchangeable?
[22:34:03] <RealityBall> if I write an if statement in javascript can the code to run be in jquery?
[22:34:25] <krn0> hello
[22:34:33] <mtime> hmm
[22:34:51] <tw2113> given that jquery is javascript
[22:35:25] <Anphonic> Whirl3d: are you wanting to itterate through a select list and check to see if it has a value that matches something else?
[22:36:41] <Whirl3d> Yeah. I want to check if an option exists of the same value. But that has to include options that don't have the"value" attribute set (using text instead)
[22:37:35] <Whirl3d> Basically, if the user selects "custom" I hide the select field and add an input field. THen when the input field blurs, I need to see if the "custom" value entered already exists...
[22:37:49] <Whirl3d> before adding a new option to the select field and selecting it.
[22:37:50] <mtime> hmmm
[22:38:56] <Anphonic> ok, so if they want to add a new item to a select list. need to make sure its not already an option
[22:39:23] <Whirl3d> perfectly said.
[22:39:48] <Whirl3d> Perhaps the :contains selector
[22:40:13] <Anphonic> couldn't you do a foreach loop through the select list and compate it to input.val() ?
[22:40:36] <Whirl3d> Yeah, it's kind of ugly. I figured there'd be a better way
[22:40:49] <RealityBall> so does this code make sense? http://pastebin.com/g5CeanEh
[22:41:06] <RealityBall> its my first time using jquery and I want to be on the right track
[22:42:06] <Whirl3d> Usually, one of the geniuses in here chimes in with a really obvious and eloquent one liner that solves the problem. Compared to my 20 lines of bulky unnecessary garbage. LOL
[22:42:17] <Anphonic> LOL too true :)
[22:44:08] <Anphonic> hmm getting an error when i try to run that on the php page now
[22:44:09] <Anphonic> DOM object constructor cannot be called as a function.
[22:45:28] <Anphonic> RealityBall: not an expert by any means but i think the $document.ready(function(){ should wrap the function
[22:46:07] <RealityBall> Anphonic: alright thank you
[22:46:16] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/xjpqc/33/
[22:46:39] <Whirl3d> Anphonic, I'm not sure I get you...what do you mean on the php page now?
[22:47:40] <Anphonic> oh the php that I actually have that on, I just put it in jsfiddle for here.
[22:47:47] <Anphonic> http://www.anphonic.com/phptest/
[22:48:00] <Anphonic> using it as a testbed for another project for work
[22:49:44] <Anphonic> Whirl3d: does seem like a lot of code to make it work, so your probably right on there being an easier way
[22:49:50] <Whirl3d> do you have to say new Image();
[22:49:55] <Whirl3d> rather than image();
[22:50:12] <Whirl3d> And mine doesn't even work. grrr
[22:50:57] <Anphonic> it's working for me
[22:51:16] <Anphonic> and ty again, thats my tired eyes for yta
[22:51:20] <Anphonic> ya*
[22:57:45] <Anphonic> well, this tired, sunburnt whiteboy is gonna take a shower n hit the hay
[22:57:57] <Anphonic> ty again Whirl3d and good luck
[22:58:49] <Whirl3d> Be good. Ty for your help too.
[23:00:45] <RealityBall> I am getting an error when I try to run this http://pastebin.com/zw12xb8W
[23:00:51] <RealityBall> that the function isn't defined
[23:05:16] <Whirl3d> RealityBall, you never define "audio"
[23:06:26] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: are you talking about the jquery code? I thought $("audio") simply retrieves all audio elements
[23:06:36] <Whirl3d> audio.play() ? try audo=$("audio").get() or something to get to your audio element, then it might work
[23:06:52] <Whirl3d> sure, but audio.play()   begs what is "audio"
[23:07:08] <RealityBall> var audio = document.getElementById("select"); 	
[23:07:22] <systemfault> s/audio/audios ?
[23:08:08] <Whirl3d> did you log audio? and does it find your element?
[23:08:37] <Whirl3d> And you are using the reserved term "select" for the ID attribute of your DOM audio element?
[23:08:47] <RealityBall> how do I know if it finds it for sure? but I am pretty sure it does it has the id select
[23:09:32] <Anphonic> console.log(audio);
[23:09:46] <Whirl3d> bring your function declaration outside of the document ready
[23:10:02] <Anphonic> ok now out
[23:10:06] * Anphonic waves
[23:10:11] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: lol k
[23:11:44] <Whirl3d> when are you calling "playTheCorner()"?
[23:12:17] <RealityBall> <a onclick="playTheCorner()">
[23:12:38] <RealityBall> its written in my html
[23:12:47] <RealityBall> I heard the cool thing to do is use eventhandlers though
[23:13:26] <jrockjiggz> yep
[23:13:31] <Whirl3d> Cool kids can be mean, though.
[23:13:46] <RealityBall> haha
[23:14:03] <RealityBall> the only reason I am scared to use eventhandlers
[23:14:10] <RealityBall> is I am dealing with an svg element
[23:16:29] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: so what do you think?
[23:18:17] <Whirl3d> I think it's like this: The cool thing to do today is to drive a hybrid. But not because they get better gas mileage or because they are better than the environment, just because of the image thing.
[23:18:53] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: haha I meant why do you think its not working?
[23:19:10] <Whirl3d> Oh, I thought you were asking in general. LOL
[23:19:16] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: actually let me paste an update of the code
[23:20:55] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: http://pastebin.com/hv4WrY95 there ya go
[23:22:37] <RealityBall> I actually have another error missing ) after argument list
[23:23:56] <Whirl3d> RealityBall....let me explain why you need $(document).ready(
[23:24:23] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: to make sure the dom object is created before the code is executed?
[23:24:45] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: or rather that it exists
[23:25:01] <Whirl3d> Right. You don't want to try to select an element that hasn't been loaded yet
[23:25:31] <Whirl3d> So there will seldom be a time that you will have your docready handler inside another function.
[23:27:02] <Whirl3d> so, I'm not sure where you call the "play the corner" function, but chances are you are doing that after the page loads, so you don't need the document ready part.
[23:27:46] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: hmmm okay
[23:28:35] <Whirl3d> but you would want the audio selector inside a document ready wrapper. give me a minute...
[23:29:16] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: haha I got it working buddy :)
[23:29:50] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: thanks I just took out the doc ready wrapper altogether and loaded the script on the last line before the body ended
[23:30:11] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: :)
[23:30:19] <Whirl3d> 8)
[23:39:01] <NaOH_> i'm making a tool tip that follows the user's mouse. the problem is that if the user moves their mouse too quickly and mouses over the tool tip, the item they were hovering over before (which triggers the tooltip) loses focus. is there some way i can get the tooltip to ignore mouse events or something?
[23:45:49] <AbstractAce> NaOH_, jsfiddle...
[23:51:36] <NaOH_> AbstractAce: http://jsfiddle.net/9YSS7/
[23:51:55] <AbstractAce> ok, give me some time.im on dialup
[23:52:58] <AbstractAce> NaOH_, are you trying to show a text when user hovers on the image?
[23:53:14] <NaOH_> AbstractAce: yes
[23:53:45] <AbstractAce> NaOH_, use the title attribute... >_> why dont people take advantage of browser features
[23:53:50] <AbstractAce> title attribute works on all browsers
[23:54:17] <NaOH_> it doesn't have exactly the same behavior
[23:54:26] <NaOH_> i would like to style it more and i dont want the delay
[23:54:48] <AbstractAce> okay
[23:55:24] <AbstractAce> why dont you just toggle a class on mouseover
[23:55:41] <AbstractAce> i mean, on mouseover show a class and mouseleave hide it
[23:55:45] <AbstractAce> wouldn't that be simpler
[23:57:22] <jrockjiggz> NaOH_: there should be no delay in movable tooltip, http://cssglobe.com/lab/tooltip/01/
