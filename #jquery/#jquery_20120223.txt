[00:16:52] <poppiez> how do you compare two elements? if (e.originalEvent.target === $('#myElem')) { alert('d'); } doesn't work
[00:17:25] <Cork> e.originalEvent.target === $('#myElem')[0]
[00:17:39] <Cork> you need to compare the dom element
[00:18:02] <poppiez> Cork: thx a lot. works like a charm :)
[00:18:28] <Cork> np
[00:24:42] <GoSox> Are there any good techniques for saving the state of a web page, so data that was loaded dynamically with jquery, can be restored when a user hits the back button to go back to a particular page?
[00:25:10] <eddyb> YES... I now have proper bottom-to-top text :D http://jsfiddle.net/bMm3Q/6/
[00:26:08] <Zogot> GoSox: I believe you do that with the hash in the URL
[00:26:18] <Zogot> Get it to read the hash and load the specific content
[00:26:56] <GoSox> there is no hash in the url? the content was loaded dynamically on page 1. Then the user goes to page 2, then hit's back to go back to page 1.
[00:27:21] <Zogot> You need to put a hash in the URL if you want to do something like http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/hash-history-jquery-bbq.html
[00:27:26] <Zogot> If Im understanding you correctly
[00:27:32] <Zogot> http://isotope.metafizzy.co/demos/hash-history.html
[00:28:36] <juho3> Is it possible to snap an an element to a grid inside an element with jquery-ui somehow?
[00:29:13] <juho3> i know it's possible to snap an element to a grid but what I want is to be able to drag an element from a div to another div, and when dropped it should snap to a grid inside that target element
[00:29:19] <Zogot> juho3: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#snap-to
[00:29:21] <GoSox> hmmm thats now what i thought you meant, but that appears to work
[00:30:13] <juho3> GoSox: I've checked that out, and it seems i can either get snapping to a certain element, or snapping to a grid
[00:30:20] <juho3> but i have no idea how to combine those two
[00:33:07] <JavaLover> hey guys i'm extremely new to jquery and i'm just trying to use this guys lionbars thing
[00:33:21] <JavaLover> he says to call   $('#box').lionbars();  on all elements that have scrollbars, currently i'm using a div with overflow:auto
[00:33:41] <JavaLover> i just can't seem to do this correctly anyone got some advice? anyone at all?
[00:34:03] <Zogot> Can you create an example in jsfiddle JavaLover?
[00:34:08] <Zogot> ?jsfiddle @ JavaLover
[00:34:09] <bot-t> JavaLover, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[00:34:46] <JavaLover> not really considering it's nothing
[00:35:02] <JavaLover> it's a 3 step tutorial, step 1 install, step 2, load the javascript & step 3 is what i just pasted
[00:35:20] <JavaLover> this is just a question...like how do you make a jquery call to an object at runtime?
[00:35:30] <JavaLover> if i wasn't such a noob I could do this, but it's just i've never done it before
[00:35:36] <GoSox> Zogot: so in theory, i could store that same info in a cookie with jquery, and then when the user went "back" to that page, I could have php read that cookie and load the correct into back in to the page server-side
[00:35:44] <JavaLover>  $('#box').lionbars();  basically how do I do that to a div?
[00:36:18] <Zogot> JavaLover: The #box is in reference to an element (including a div) with an id="box"
[00:36:31] <Zogot> Give your div an id="box"
[00:36:46] <Zogot> GoSox: Not sure, can't say I've ever tried that
[00:36:58] <GoSox> i think it can work
[00:37:10] <GoSox> ill give it a shot
[00:37:14] <GoSox> (when the time comes)
[00:37:36] <Zogot> GoSox: Wouldn't that pretty much defeat the point of the JS if your just determining content based off the URL on the server side (like normal frameworks or sites :p )
[00:37:43] <JavaLover> right but then does that go off at runtime?
[00:38:20] <JavaLover> like i just did that it does nothing
[00:38:40] <GoSox> Zogot: i wouldn't be determining content based off the URL, i'd be determining content best on the data you dynamically loaded into the page, leaving bread crumbs... i mean cookie crumbs, for PHP to read when you went 'back'
[00:38:46] <GoSox> i could give those cookies a 2 hour lifespan
[00:38:48] <JavaLover> i guess we could make a fiddle just...
[00:39:01] <JavaLover> if theres a proper way to load jquery that's the answer to my problem
[00:39:28] <JavaLover>  <script type="text/javascript" src = "jquery.js"></script>
[00:39:28] <JavaLover>   <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.lionbars.0.3.min.js"></script>
[00:39:28] <JavaLover>   <script type="text/javascript">
[00:39:28] <JavaLover>   alert("k loading");
[00:39:28] <JavaLover>   $('#test').lionbars();
[00:39:28] <JavaLover>   </script>
[00:39:34] <JavaLover> srry for spam srry srry srry
[00:39:39] <GoSox> and if you left the site completely adn came back, and that data was preloaded again... that wouldn't be terrible, the site would still keep functioning normally with jquery, where you could dismiss the data showing and display different data effortlessly
[00:40:31] <JavaLover> the k loading goess off but the scroll bar remains the same
[00:40:59] <Zogot> JavaLover please dont paste code here, use jsfiddle
[00:41:32] <Zogot> Is jquery loading in general JavaLover?
[00:41:43] <Zogot> Also wait, is that in your head? you dont have a document ready
[00:41:58] <GoSox> irc clients really should, by default, confirm with you before you paste multiple lines to a channel
[00:42:06] <GoSox> or at least, 3 or more lines
[00:42:06] <JavaLover> no i have the document i'm just seeing
[00:42:11] <JavaLover> if there's something i'm missing since i'm a noob
[00:42:15] <Zogot> Add around the alert and $('#test') etc etc with $(document).ready(function(){  // that code here })
[00:42:22] <JavaLover> awww yes see
[00:42:23] <GoSox> its so easy to have the wrong thing in your clipboard
[00:42:25] <JavaLover> that's what i was missing
[00:42:26] <JavaLover> ty
[00:43:49] <JavaLover> YESSSS
[00:43:52] <JavaLover> ty zogot
[00:43:54] <JavaLover> ty so much works now
[00:44:01] <JavaLover> see told you it was just a noob question
[00:44:01] <Zogot> :p
[00:44:09] <JavaLover> i'm not familiar with syntax yet
[00:44:34] <JavaLover> and load states etc.
[00:44:39] <GoSox> jquery syntax can be a little crazy
[00:44:44] <JavaLover> i'm learning...these past 5 years i've been coding mobile apps
[00:44:55] <GoSox> {(){(}{(({}(()}{:)}{)(})(};)({)(}{()}{);{})(}{)(}
[00:45:04] <JavaLover> and now i'm doing a website & i'm like "jquery wtf?"
[00:45:19] <JavaLover> kinda makes me wonder what happened to flash, i take it it basically died out
[00:45:39] <GoSox> thats what happened to me when i tried to learn Obj-C
[00:46:08] <GoSox> flash is now used almost exclusively for video and ads
[00:46:12] <JavaLover> yeah
[00:46:21] <GoSox> flash's primary purpose is to deplete your battery
[00:46:25] <JavaLover> hahahahaha
[00:46:25] <GoSox> and it's really good at it
[00:46:44] <JavaLover> i like this stuff though
[00:46:45] <GoSox> i keep trying to uninstall it from my laptop, but then I always reinstall it so i can watch video
[00:46:47] <Es0teric|AFK> how does .find() work?
[00:46:50] <JavaLover> the jquery etc, i think it looks good
[00:46:59] <JavaLover> anyways help esoteric & ty for your help
[00:47:00] <Es0teric|AFK> does it work only on the current element?
[00:47:29] <JavaLover> Esoteric I just used the .find function, it works like a charm
[00:47:41] <JavaLover> for me it finds the next element as if it was reading the source code
[00:47:56] <Es0teric|AFK> hmm
[00:48:03] <Es0teric|AFK> i am having a problem with this .find() element
[00:48:09] <Es0teric|AFK> method*
[00:48:13] <JavaLover> lemme show you my code 1 sec
[00:48:22] <Zogot> Es0teric|AFK: What isn't working ?
[00:48:47] <JavaLover>  $(".thecomment").hover(function() {    $(this).find("div.desc").show("medium"); },function(){ $(this).find("div.desc").hide(); });
[00:48:48] <Es0teric|AFK> wtf? this still has me as AFK?
[00:49:22] <JavaLover> see i used that & then on hover I had to find the div i wanted, my div was really far away & it still found it & displayed properly for a list of like 30 of them
[00:49:27] <Es0teric|AFK> JavaLover, what if you want to hover over .thecomment but get the <p> of a child element inside the parent .thecomment is in?
[00:49:47] <JavaLover> i had this concern, for me it worked fine
[00:49:53] <JavaLover> i think it's related to where it shows up
[00:50:00] <JavaLover> so it finds the next one and that's it
[00:51:19] <Zogot> JavaLover: A good resource also http://jqfundamentals.com/
[00:51:25] <JavaLover> let us know more what it is you need it to do & we can help, i'm a noob but hey I just did that
[00:51:41] <JavaLover> thx zogot :-)
[00:51:43] <GoSox> can javascript set a cookie at any arbitrary time?
[00:51:48] <Es0teric|AFK> ontop of that, JavaLover i have data-type elements that i want to retrieve
[00:51:59] <Es0teric|AFK> and right now its only retrieving one
[00:52:08] <GoSox> (PHP can only set a cookie on page load, before any content is sent)
[00:52:25] <JavaLover> for this issue, i recommend pastebinning your code or doing a js fiddle or whatever that is
[00:52:54] <JavaLover> see with me, I wanted it to only retrieve one so I was happy with it
[00:53:00] <JavaLover> idk how you'd go about retrieving multiples
[00:53:25] <Es0teric|AFK> JavaLover, i know how to retrieve all at once, but i want to retrieve one by one according to whats hovered
[00:53:40] <JavaLover> then just retrieve on hover...
[00:53:48] <Es0teric|AFK> and i cant do the $(this) on the hovered element
[00:53:55] <JavaLover> huh? you sure?
[00:53:58] <Zogot> You can
[00:54:06] <JavaLover> look at my code, that's doing it on the hovered div
[00:54:20] <Es0teric|AFK> Zogot, no i cant because the <p> is not a child in the hovered element
[00:54:33] <JavaLover> hmm in my case it was
[00:54:36] <JavaLover> well
[00:54:39] <JavaLover> wait a minute
[00:54:49] <Es0teric|AFK> wouldnt i have to...
[00:54:59] <Es0teric|AFK> hover then bind to the parent element its in?
[00:55:13] <Zogot> Can you give an example at jsfiddle Es0teric|AFK
[00:55:27] <Es0teric|AFK> Zogot, i dont do jsfiddles.. that shit takes TOO long
[00:55:27] <Es0teric|AFK> lol
[00:55:29] <JavaLover> you can say Parent() but yeah paste ur code
[00:55:37] <JavaLover> then atleast pastebin it
[00:55:50] <JavaLover> don't tell me that takes too long, that's ctrl a, ctrl v post
[00:55:52] <Es0teric|AFK> alright, JavaLover… do i pastebin the markup
[00:55:57] <Es0teric|AFK> or both script and markup?
[00:56:09] <JavaLover> just pastebin whatever you're looking at right now
[00:56:14] <Es0teric|AFK> alright give me a min
[00:58:37] <deeprogram> why have error "on is not defined " when like that $('body').on()
[00:58:43] <deeprogram> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[00:58:54] <deeprogram> query says it have .on() method
[00:59:33] <Cork> deeprogram: something is overwriting $
[00:59:50] <deeprogram> I don't think
[00:59:51] <Cork> try jQuery('body')on
[00:59:56] <Cork> sorry jQuery('body').on
[01:00:05] <deeprogram> (function ($) {}) (window.jQuery);
[01:00:19] <deeprogram> the .on() is called in the body of function
[01:01:18] <Cork> deeprogram: what version of jquery?
[01:01:35] <deeprogram> 1.7.1
[01:01:53] <deeprogram> Cork:  I think you are wriht
[01:01:56] <deeprogram> right
[01:02:17] <deeprogram> something overwrite window.jQuery
[01:02:18] <Es0teric|AFK> JavaLover, http://pastebin.com/F9k8xjkw
[01:02:22] <Es0teric|AFK> its kind of messy but...
[01:02:24] <Es0teric|AFK> thats the markup
[01:02:29] <Cork> check if(jQuery === $) { alert('yes')}
[01:02:46] <Cork> opps sorry
[01:02:59] <Cork> check if jQuery.fn.jquery exists
[01:03:05] <Cork> and what version it says it is
[01:03:12] <deeprogram> Cork: OK OK
[01:03:19] <deeprogram> Cork: it works!
[01:03:42] <deeprogram> I put the tag that contains query on the bottom of page
[01:03:45] <deeprogram> it works
[01:04:01] <Cork> deeprogram: better is to find what causes it
[01:04:20] <Cork> might be ex. your including two versions of jquery
[01:04:23] <deeprogram> yeah ! I am finding the place
[01:04:24] <Es0teric|AFK> what is the use of declaring .fn?
[01:04:41] <Cork> $.fn is all functions you can use on selectors
[01:04:52] <Cork> like .find or .on or .bind, or .each
[01:04:58] <Es0teric|AFK> i see
[01:05:06] <Es0teric|AFK> so its like
[01:05:10] <Es0teric|AFK> declaring a global function
[01:05:11] <Cork> $.function is things you can't use selectors on
[01:05:17] <Cork> like $.ajax $.get $.getJSON
[01:06:10] <Cork> Es0teric|AFK: functions declared on $ won't exist if you do something like $('body').<name>
[01:06:14] <Cork> only $.fn does
[01:06:38] <JavaLover> see esoteric, pastebin helps :-)
[01:07:03] <Es0teric|AFK> JavaLover, well for js idk… yes for php
[01:07:06] <Es0teric|AFK> but idk for js lol
[01:07:07] <JavaLover> ok i just had a thought
[01:07:20] <JavaLover> what if on irc there was a way we could utalize a pastebin?
[01:07:22] <Es0teric|AFK> Cork, thats intresting to know though...
[01:07:35] <JavaLover> what if you could download a special version of irc with a pastebin plugin?
[01:07:43] <Es0teric|AFK> JavaLover, you mean a script to automatically post on pastebin?
[01:07:43] <Cork> JavaLover: you mean like google wave? :)
[01:07:49] <JavaLover> yeah only not gay
[01:07:50] <Es0teric|AFK> googlewave is dead..
[01:07:56] <Es0teric|AFK> i kinda liked it
[01:08:12] <JavaLover> this would just be something where like
[01:08:19] <JavaLover> ok so say I post it on here
[01:08:23] <JavaLover> and you don't have the proper irc
[01:08:26] <JavaLover> it then links to a pastebin
[01:08:32] <Cork> JavaLover: one of the reason irc is so wide spread, it cause theres so many clients that supports it
[01:08:42] <Cork> JavaLover: if you add things like that you would lose that
[01:08:43] <Es0teric|AFK> JavaLover, theres a python skype plugin for that..
[01:08:50] <Cork> and the main selling point for irc would be lost
[01:08:51] <JavaLover> really?
[01:08:53] <JavaLover> that's kinda cool
[01:08:54] <GoSox> that would be kind of awesome. build it into the feature I mentioned earlier. Whenever you try to paste more than 2 lines, it would throw you a window letting you cancel, go through and send the large message, or automatically post it to a pastebin, and send the url to the pastebin to teh channel instead of the text
[01:08:56] <GoSox> genius!
[01:09:14] <Es0teric|AFK> JavaLover, yeah… i know about it because well - my friend made it...
[01:09:15] <JavaLover> GoSox that's what i'm talking about
[01:09:15] <Es0teric|AFK> lol
[01:09:26] <GoSox> JavaLover: make it happen
[01:09:29] <JavaLover> like it doesn't have to change irc
[01:09:35] <JavaLover> it would just link to pastebin if you don' thave it
[01:09:42] <Cork> ah
[01:09:49] <JavaLover> see it's easy for me to click on the link for pastebin i don't mind that
[01:09:52] <JavaLover> it's the minimizing irc
[01:09:56] <JavaLover> opening pastebin
[01:10:02] <JavaLover> etc. that's the hassle
[01:10:13] <GoSox> it could be made fully automatic very easily
[01:10:15] <Es0teric|AFK> JavaLover, i am sure its possible… nothing is impossible - its just approaching it
[01:10:20] <GoSox> easily, if you know Objective-C, which I do not
[01:10:37] <JavaLover> i'll give you an example
[01:10:49] <JavaLover> anyone here ever played simulated arcade games, mame etc
[01:10:55] <JavaLover> this is off topic btw
[01:11:03] <rambo3> wolfenstein
[01:11:12] <JavaLover> well point is they have this client called kaillera client, it allows you to play online
[01:11:19] <JavaLover> but they made multiple versions
[01:11:30] <JavaLover> in one of the versions, it's superb, like everything is wayyyy better
[01:11:41] <JavaLover> but anyone can use any client to play each other it's all the same just different gui
[01:11:46] <JavaLover> i propose a coders gui for irc
[01:11:50] <Es0teric|AFK> JavaLover, do you know Java?
[01:11:54] <JavaLover> yup
[01:11:59] <Es0teric|AFK> intresting
[01:12:06] <rambo3> disguting
[01:12:09] <rambo3> *s
[01:12:19] <Es0teric|AFK> i want to get into Java/C++ when i master the web-side languages
[01:12:26] <JavaLover> i would really like the coders gui
[01:12:27] <Es0teric|AFK> which wont be too long..
[01:12:32] <rambo3> C#/C++
[01:12:49] <JavaLover> in fact, maybe even one where you could search the web based on something someone said
[01:12:56] <JavaLover> and literally "here lemme google that for you" inside irc
[01:13:17] <JavaLover> like right click & say "give google link"
[01:13:24] <Es0teric|AFK> JavaLover, theres a bot that does a lmgtfy… i saw it on swiftirc
[01:13:34] <GoSox> you can already easily google any selected text on OS X
[01:13:36] <JavaLover> yeah but this would be a client, it's different
[01:13:51] <JavaLover> and the thing about this tool
[01:13:59] <JavaLover> is that it would be made specifically for the benefit of knowledge & nothing more
[01:14:10] <JavaLover> this project would earn only based on donations lol
[01:14:22] <Es0teric|AFK> idk man… wit that lmgtfy feature… alot of people can be assholes about that
[01:14:37] <GoSox> Es0teric|AFK: that is the very nature of IRC
[01:14:41] <JavaLover> well you don't have to click on the link
[01:14:47] <GoSox> to tell people who ask questions, to go read the manual
[01:14:48] <JavaLover> it would just show you the link, it's up to you
[01:14:53] <Es0teric|AFK> i have seen people use lmgtfy in asshole-ish context
[01:15:07] <JavaLover> and maybe it says this instead
[01:15:11] <JavaLover> "here i googled it for you: "
[01:15:18] <JavaLover> and ya know what in my client
[01:15:23] <xec> theres plenty of bots that google for you already
[01:15:24] <JavaLover> you could roll over it & it would display the google page
[01:15:26] <Es0teric|AFK> thats a nice way of saying "i am being an asshole"
[01:15:41] <JavaLover> yo how awesome would that be, one where all links you could just roll over
[01:15:43] <JavaLover> and display it
[01:15:57] <Es0teric|AFK> rediculous?
[01:16:07] <Es0teric|AFK> BUT i gotta admit
[01:16:10] <Es0teric|AFK> if that client existed
[01:16:12] <Es0teric|AFK> i would use it
[01:16:16] <JavaLover> exactly
[01:16:19] <JavaLover> call it 1337 irc
[01:16:31] <Es0teric|AFK> i would come up with a better name
[01:16:34] <JavaLover> built in symbols list
[01:16:35] <JavaLover> where you can find the proper happy face
[01:16:47] <JavaLover> just overall like I love irc but
[01:16:54] <JavaLover> a lot of stuff you have to know, it's not in the gui
[01:17:00] <Es0teric|AFK> yeah.. but
[01:17:00] <Es0teric|AFK> uh
[01:17:06] <Es0teric|AFK> JavaLover, that pastebin link i sent you
[01:17:07] <Es0teric|AFK> expires in
[01:17:11] <Es0teric|AFK> 40 mins
[01:17:15] <JavaLover> lol k
[01:17:28] <JavaLover> i thought you solved this
[01:17:29] <Es0teric|AFK> i just remembered.. i put a 1 hr time limit
[01:17:31] <Es0teric|AFK> no
[01:17:40] <Es0teric|AFK> if i solved it, why would i pastebin it?
[01:17:40] <Es0teric|AFK> lol
[01:17:49] <Es0teric|AFK> i was waiting on you
[01:18:27] <JavaLover> http://pastebin.com/F9k8xjkw everyone please look this over & help Es0teric
[01:18:46] <Es0teric|AFK> that shit is a mess...
[01:19:14] <tw2113> so others can learn?
[01:19:28] <Es0teric|AFK> tw2113, yes… so they can learn WHAT NOT to do..
[01:19:29] <Cork> i wish ppl could stop using pastebin start to use a decent script site
[01:19:32] <Es0teric|AFK> in markup
[01:19:48] <tw2113> learning is learning dude
[01:19:56] <Es0teric|AFK> it looks alot neater on my source though...
[01:20:53] <Es0teric|AFK> my problem is.. that right now its logging ONE data-type
[01:21:29] <xec> this is just markup?
[01:21:36] <Es0teric|AFK> and i cant do $('.assignmt_img').hover(function() { $(this).find('p'); });
[01:22:18] <Es0teric|AFK> yes, xec its just the markup… i dont really have the js up because i am trying to log all of the data-types first
[01:22:40] <Cork> data types?
[01:22:40] <xec> Es0teric|AFK: there's no paragraphs underneath .assignmt_img
[01:22:41] <One-Man-Bucket> hmm, should outerHeight() on a hidden input element really return anything but 0?
[01:23:07] <Es0teric|AFK> xec, yes i know thats why i said ** and i cant do $('.assignmt_img').hover(function() { $(this).find('p'); }); **
[01:23:27] <xec> so what exactly are you trying to do
[01:23:37] <Cork> Es0teric|AFK: the markup isn't even valid
[01:23:47] <xec> you got a ul in a ul
[01:23:51] <Es0teric|AFK> cork, thats not the whole markup.. thats just a snipplet
[01:23:58] <xec> doesnt matter
[01:23:59] <Cork> Es0teric|AFK: its still broken
[01:24:12] <Cork> it has to be <ul><li><ul><li>
[01:24:22] <Cork> not <ul><li></li><ul>
[01:24:22] <Es0teric|AFK> cork, WHAT?
[01:24:33] <Cork> line 79 is invalid
[01:24:53] <Cork> same with line 35
[01:25:00] <Cork> and 12
[01:25:25] <Cork> if you want sub lists they have to be in li's
[01:25:55] <Es0teric|AFK> right now
[01:25:55] <Es0teric|AFK> c
[01:25:59] <Es0teric|AFK> i am trying to make this work
[01:26:01] <Cork> <ul>  <li>something</li> <li><ul><li>something else</li></ul></li> </ul>
[01:26:21] <Cork> Es0teric|AFK: its not posible as you would have to relay on dom error corrections
[01:26:28] <Cork> and thats BAD
[01:26:40] <Es0teric|AFK> cork
[01:26:45] <Es0teric|AFK> i have
[01:26:57] <Es0teric|AFK> 200+ lines of php loops
[01:27:02] <Es0teric|AFK> and variables
[01:27:06] <Es0teric|AFK> that dictate that
[01:27:19] <xec> lol. fix markup first :)
[01:27:24] <Cork> well you have an invalid html, and you can only guess what the js should do
[01:27:32] <Es0teric|AFK> well whoopty doo
[01:27:36] <Cork> as error correction would make it different in different browsers
[01:27:45] <klawd> hi! $('#someul > li:nth-child(1)') should return a max of one element, no?
[01:28:06] <Cork> some will make <li class="wrkwk"> a sibling to <li class="assignmt_type">
[01:28:14] <Es0teric|AFK> if you have any idea how many times i have corrected the html already
[01:28:18] <Cork> some will make an additional <li> and wrapp the ul in that
[01:28:26] <Es0teric|AFK> i spent a whole freakin day
[01:28:28] <Es0teric|AFK> just doing the markup
[01:28:32] <Es0teric|AFK> HELL NO i am not changing it now
[01:28:36] <xec> lol
[01:28:39] <Cork> Es0teric|AFK: so its not posible to give you a selector that will work
[01:28:43] <fleur> oh hai der
[01:28:56] <blackspotwiggins> Es0teric|AFK, it takes a whole day to create markup?
[01:28:59] <blackspotwiggins> wtf you doing ?
[01:29:06] <fleur> I'm very used to prototype, and I just started to use jquery
[01:29:09] <Es0teric|AFK> blackspotwiggins, create markup? no man.. EDIT
[01:29:27] <Es0teric|AFK> like i said, 200+ lines of loops and shit
[01:29:42] <Cork> Es0teric|AFK: well its outputing unusable html
[01:29:46] <Cork> so it needs to be fixed
[01:29:51] <Es0teric|AFK> cork
[01:29:52] <Cork> it shouldn't be that hard
[01:29:58] <fleur> when I use prototype, I usually bind an event to a table (for example) and then I retrieve the dbid of the tr the user clicked
[01:29:59] <Es0teric|AFK> i got an idea
[01:30:02] <Cork> just wrap the <ul> with an <li>
[01:30:06] <fleur> how can I achieve that with jquery ?
[01:30:08] <Es0teric|AFK> how about i give you the PHP snipplet for that and you can do it
[01:30:09] <Es0teric|AFK> :)
[01:30:12] <blackspotwiggins> ?on @ fleur
[01:30:12] <bot-t> fleur, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:30:16] <xec> Es0teric|AFK:  if you need help with your php, go to #php
[01:30:20] <GoSox> it's a real shame you can't do variables in CSS
[01:30:32] <Es0teric|AFK> xec, i never said i needed help with my php.. my data obviously outputs fine
[01:30:37] <tw2113> it's called LESS/SASS GoSox
[01:30:43] <xec> Es0teric|AFK: obviously not, you mean
[01:30:49] <Cork> Es0teric|AFK: the answer right now is that you have unreliable code, so you can't do dom work on it
[01:30:56] <Es0teric|AFK> xec, my data outputs fine, its just the markup
[01:31:03] <predikt> GoSox, +1 with what tw2113, works really good
[01:31:07] <blackspotwiggins> Es0teric|AFK, stop whining and fix your shit
[01:31:11] <Cork> Es0teric|AFK: "just"
[01:31:17] <klawd> hi! $('#someul > li:nth-child(1)') should return a max of one element, no?
[01:31:18] <xec> Es0teric|AFK: your data is in markup, your output is markup, your output is WRONG
[01:31:38] <Es0teric|AFK> cork, at least edit it on pastebin
[01:31:40] <Cork> klafka: as long as the browser supports nth-child() yes
[01:31:58] <Es0teric|AFK> xec, i am talking about the data that my php is recieving from the db
[01:32:16] <Cork> Es0teric|AFK: line 12 should be <li><ul> line 23 should be </ul></li>
[01:32:19] <blackspotwiggins> Cork, i think jquery normalizes that?
[01:32:23] <Es0teric|AFK> PASTEBIN
[01:32:24] <blackspotwiggins> nth-child i mean
[01:32:27] <Cork> and the same with the other invalid parts
[01:32:29] <Es0teric|AFK> the markup is on PASTEBIN
[01:32:35] <tw2113> oh the joys of server content, server side code, client side code, and final rendered markup
[01:32:37] <Cork> blackspotwiggins: no
[01:32:46] <Cork> blackspotwiggins: jquery uses :eq
[01:32:54] <Es0teric|AFK> tw2113, you have a good sense of humor
[01:32:56] <mindis|wurk> ugh. manipulating selections sure is complicated in js
[01:33:01] <blackspotwiggins> the browsers that have qsa almost always have nth-child?
[01:33:08] <Cork> no
[01:33:16] <blackspotwiggins> hmm, o
[01:33:17] <blackspotwiggins> k
[01:33:20] <Cork> :eq is jquery internal
[01:33:37] <Cork> its just a function sizzle calls
[01:33:42] <phobia> Hi! :) Does anybody know who made the $.plugin plugin instantiator? I got the code but no credits :P http://pastie.org/3435688
[01:33:51] <Es0teric|AFK> cork is tellin me the lines to fix but he forgets this is a… live chat so the lines he tells me to fix get pushed up.. why not create a new version of that pastebin with the edited markup?
[01:33:55] <xec> Cork: but if the browser doesn't support nth-child, jquery still lets you do it, doesn't it...
[01:34:03] <blackspotwiggins> Cork, so nth-child isn't passed to queryselector?
[01:34:13] <Cork> xec: sure, but it will fails on the other browsers
[01:34:25] <xec> what?
[01:34:28] <blackspotwiggins> hmm
[01:34:29] <Cork> blackspotwiggins: sure, thats all it does
[01:34:31] <blackspotwiggins> i can test that
[01:34:35] <xec> it will fail on the browsers that support it?
[01:34:44] <Cork> no... >_<
[01:34:44] <blackspotwiggins> according to caniuse.com the only browser that has qsa and does not have nth-child is ie8
[01:34:45] <Cork> oposit
[01:35:11] <tw2113> what? i have a good sense of humor? *doomed*
[01:35:13] <Es0teric|AFK> i dont get it..
[01:35:35] <tw2113> sarcasm
[01:35:37] <Es0teric|AFK> i have a <ul> wrapped in a <li> and a nested <ul> with another <li>
[01:35:38] <Cork> Es0teric|AFK: run your generated html through http://validator.w3.org/
[01:35:47] <Cork> Es0teric|AFK: when its green come back
[01:35:58] <Es0teric|AFK> cork, yeah yeah that sounds FINE
[01:36:20] <Es0teric|AFK> my Doctype is HTML5...
[01:36:21] <Es0teric|AFK> s
[01:36:21] <Es0teric|AFK> o
[01:36:26] <Es0teric|AFK> it will come back green quick
[01:36:33] <Cork> not really
[01:37:20] <fleur> blackspotwiggins: well, I still dont see how .on can help me tell which tr or td
[01:37:44] <fleur> blackspotwiggins: oops I forgot the end : "which td AND tr was clicked"
[01:38:26] <blackspotwiggins> fleur, $("table").on("click", "tr", function() { console.log(this) })
[01:38:49] <Es0teric|AFK> lmao
[01:39:05] <Es0teric|AFK> it doesnt validate text/php headers
[01:39:16] <Cork> Es0teric|AFK: point the site
[01:39:20] <Cork> don't paste your php
[01:39:29] <Cork> it wants the generated html
[01:39:29] <Es0teric|AFK> i didnt paste my php
[01:39:32] <Es0teric|AFK> i uploaded my file
[01:39:40] <Cork> thats still php
[01:39:40] <Es0teric|AFK> this is all on my local server
[01:39:49] <Cork> then open the site in a browser
[01:39:53] <Cork> save the html to a file
[01:39:56] <Cork> and upload that
[01:40:00] <predikt> wondering if somone can assist. I have some json trying to get, i get response looking at console, but it's not passing data into callback function: http://pastebin.com/GuES1p1K
[01:40:16] <fleur> blackspotwiggins: I saw that selector option, but then how can I know, which img in a particular td was clicked : I want to determine which img was clicked to know what I'm supposed to do (edit, delete, etc) and then which tr was clicked to be able to know which id I'm working on
[01:40:37] <blackspotwiggins> fleur, did you try the code i JUST gave you?
[01:41:52] <fleur> blackspotwiggins: I just did, and I get the whole tr, how can I know, which td (for example) was clicked in this tr ?
[01:42:13] <blackspotwiggins> then attach it to td?
[01:42:17] <blackspotwiggins> read ffs
[01:44:12] <xec> fleur: if you need the tr *and* the td, you can attach to td and use $(this).parent() to find the tr
[01:45:13] <fleur> xec I was about to do that, but I'd like know the tr if it is the .parent() or the .parent().parent()
[01:45:22] <blackspotwiggins> ?closest @ fleur
[01:45:22] <bot-t> fleur, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[01:45:39] <predikt> fyi, just found out my json issue. was failing silently due to invalid json. said it in the jquery help docs too
[01:45:43] <xec> fleur: if you attach to td, the tr will always be the parent, yes?
[01:46:29] <fleur> xec, sometimes these are imgs in the td, sometimes it's the td, but thanks for your help, blackspotwiggins's closest seem to be right way
[01:47:31] <xec> sigh
[01:51:04] <sweb> jquery team have any issue for right to left direction pages for jquery ui ?
[01:53:05] <One-Man-Bucket> is this expected behaviour: http://jsfiddle.net/jL7Lr/
[01:55:03] <Ortund> I have a problem with filepaths to images that I'm cycling on my page with setInterval. It works if I'm in the site's root, but breaks when I'm not... how can I always use an absolute path in my variable?
[01:55:16] <Ortund> var path = "/App_Themes/Default/Images/this.jpg";
[01:55:48] <Cork> that should be an absolute path
[01:56:00] <Cork> unless you append something to the url
[01:56:05] <Cork> or the servers broken
[01:56:15] <Cork> hmm, no btw not the server
[01:57:32] <JavaLover> awesome
[01:57:33] <JavaLover> that was really hard but so worth it
[01:57:38] <JavaLover> i now have scroller just like facebook wooohoo!
[01:57:50] <xec> One-Man-Bucket: i would expect 0, really, like you get with .height() - but i guess jquery looks at styles and adds them
[01:58:10] <JavaLover> on rollover the scroller shows up & when i'm not hovering it goes away
[01:58:12] <JavaLover> SO AWESOME
[01:58:20] <JavaLover> i love jquery
[02:00:02] <wojtek> hi
[02:00:12] <xec> One-Man-Bucket: on the other hand.. maybe it does have a height even if hidden http://jsfiddle.net/jL7Lr/2/
[02:00:16] <One-Man-Bucket> xec: it's a bug i think.. but i can't report it (trac thinks i'm spamming)
[02:00:30] <wojtek> when is deferred.always called? before or after resolve/reject?
[02:00:39] <One-Man-Bucket> the thing is, the browser doesn't honor padding on hidden inputs
[02:01:17] <One-Man-Bucket> https://gist.github.com/1892045
[02:02:28] <xec> One-Man-Bucket: well, anything hidden won't be rendered obviously, but it appears the element still has a height
[02:03:05] <Es0teric|AFK> OHHH i see the problem with my markup now
[02:03:07] <blackspotwiggins> One-Man-Bucket, i think determining height of hidden elements is unreliable in jquery and not worth fixing
[02:03:08] <Es0teric|AFK> you cant have
[02:03:12] <Es0teric|AFK> child <ul>s
[02:03:19] <Es0teric|AFK> within the same UL
[02:03:24] <Es0teric|AFK> which is why you out it in a <li>
[02:03:34] <Es0teric|AFK> *put
[02:03:48] <One-Man-Bucket> blackspotwiggins: it breaks jquery-ui layout plugin
[02:03:59] <blackspotwiggins> ?
[02:04:00] <MDman> hi
[02:04:08] <blackspotwiggins> One-Man-Bucket, which one is that?
[02:04:59] <MDman> I don't know where I am doing bad in a simple example of resizable (jquery UI).
[02:05:00] <One-Man-Bucket> blackspotwiggins: this one: http://layout.jquery-dev.net/
[02:05:22] <blackspotwiggins> One-Man-Bucket, well, it is from 2010
[02:05:59] <MDman> But with the last version of jquery UI I can't make a simple resizable div.
[02:06:02] <blackspotwiggins> as i said, it's unreliable
[02:06:30] <blackspotwiggins> maybe in 2010 it worked, now it doesn't it's the plugins fault for relying on uncertain behaviour
[02:06:46] <One-Man-Bucket> blackspotwiggins: yeah.. but i reported it as a bug anyway
[02:07:12] <One-Man-Bucket> i think what the plugin does is to grab all child elements outside of a pane and calculate the heights of those
[02:07:33] <MDman> The source code is easy, but I have put in the pastebin (http://pastebin.com/R8VsAgiA). Who can help me?
[02:07:36] <One-Man-Bucket> and if any elements happen to be hidden inputs the result is wrong.
[02:07:46] <One-Man-Bucket> it's not an unreasonable edge case  imo
[02:08:30] <klawd> does jquery have anything in the likes of mootool's Class method?
[02:08:46] <klawd> an easy way to create classes?
[02:08:50] <nFFF> fuck mootools
[02:09:04] <Cork> klafka: no
[02:09:08] <Sebah> I have a JavascriptTemplate in my html. How could I access a div with an specific id within it ( I'm using blueimp's jquery uploader plugin )
[02:09:16] <klawd> yeah, fuck mootools. their way of handling classes is superior though
[02:09:45] <Epeli> superior to nothing?
[02:09:54] <klawd> Sebah: $(your_html_string).find('#foo');
[02:10:00] <klawd> Epeli: yes.
[02:10:10] <Epeli> makes sense
[02:10:18] <nFFF> mootools isnt the tool of a bawse
[02:10:37] <klawd> Epeli: javascript's handling of classes is inconvinient and weird. at least it feels like that to me
[02:11:10] <Cork> klafka: javascript dosen't have classes, and that might be why :)
[02:11:17] <klawd> i know.
[02:11:25] <Epeli> you can use whatever class helper you like with jquery
[02:11:25] <klawd> and that's just the thing. :D
[02:11:25] <Cork> it has constructors and prototype objects
[02:12:06] <Cork> klafka: anyway jquery is aimed at dom manipulation
[02:12:11] <Cork> not coding
[02:12:14] <Sebah> klawd: what do you mean exactly with 'your_html_string'?
[02:12:33] <Cork> Segaja: the html returned from the templater
[02:12:39] <Cork> run it through $()
[02:12:45] <Epeli> Backbone has solved that issue for me
[02:12:53] <klawd> Sebah: like this: $('<span class="foo">bar</span>') will create you a new span, you know
[02:13:12] <Cork> klafka: he uses a template plugin
[02:13:17] <Cork> its a bit different
[02:13:26] <klawd> its klawd, not klafka :P
[02:13:32] <Cork> opps
[02:13:33] <Cork> sorry
[02:13:41] <klawd> Cork: yes, i see. but he will get his markup eventually
[02:13:46] <klawd> and if not, i don't really see a way
[02:14:11] <blackspotwiggins> klawd, use JS native prototypal inheritance
[02:14:36] <klawd> blackspotwiggins: i don't really understand it though, to be real honest
[02:14:41] <blackspotwiggins> learn?
[02:14:53] <Sebah> klawd & Cork: this ( http://pastebin.com/rQd04ciP ) is the script that's right at the bottom of my html file ( before the <body> tag is closed ). I'm trying to access the 'a#tool-page-crop'.
[02:14:55] <klawd> blackspotwiggins: i've been writing js for a couple of years now and read a ton of docs
[02:15:02] <klawd> blackspotwiggins: it's still not clear to me
[02:15:40] <Cork> Sebah: what are you using to run the template?
[02:16:01] <Sebah> Cork: This specific jquery plugin -> http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/
[02:18:25] <Cork> Sebah: then your out of luck
[02:18:41] <Cork> Sebah: it doesn't dive you a handle to the html or dom elements
[02:18:44] <Cork> *give
[02:19:29] <Sebah> Cork: god dammit... I was affraid that I was right :(. Thanks though
[02:19:49] <Segaja> Cork: i think you talked to the wrong person
[02:20:17] <Cork> Segaja: nope
[02:20:28] <Cork> ah up there
[02:20:30] <Cork> ya sorry
[02:20:30] <mehrdad> i change the style of a div like this :  $newdiv1.css("left",(this.$input.offset().left+10)+'');
[02:20:35] <mehrdad> but it doesn't work
[02:21:02] <Cork> you need the px
[02:21:11] <Cork> $newdiv1.css("left",(this.$input.offset().left+10)+'px');
[02:21:15] <mehrdad> whatever i put as the second argument it resets itself to auto
[02:21:30] <mehrdad> ahh!
[02:21:36] <blackspotwiggins> add an unit?
[02:21:58] <blackspotwiggins> ah nm
[02:27:22] <gabriel9> morning, is this corect way to select some elements from response(post)
[02:27:24] <gabriel9> jQuery('.button', response)
[02:27:56] <Cork> its one of the ways yes
[02:28:00] <gabriel9> when i do that i don't get any elements, but there is some elements with button class
[02:28:39] <Cork> gabriel9: is response the html?
[02:28:45] <gabriel9> no, string
[02:28:47] <Cork> have you tried console.log(response)
[02:28:48] <gabriel9> it is
[02:29:00] <gabriel9> i'm looking at it in debugger :)
[02:29:02] <Cork> string == html :)
[02:29:06] <redheadphones> i'm trying to find the height/width of a g element (svg grouping), but i'm just getting 0 with .height()/.width(). how can i figure out these dimensions?
[02:30:00] <Ortund> redheadphones, $(".svg").height() returns 0?
[02:30:03] <gabriel9> i still don't get it, this should work
[02:30:29] <wojtek> Can I append DOM structure to an empty $() and then operate on it? Something like html fragment? It doesn't seem to work - I get an empty jQuery object
[02:30:45] <redheadphones> Ortund, i have the g tag with id="inner" and $("#inner").height() returns 0
[02:31:44] <Ortund> g tag is html5? does jquery recognize html5 tags?
[02:31:57] <Cork> it does
[02:32:07] <Cork> jquery doens't care about tag manes
[02:32:09] <Cork> *names
[02:33:00] <redheadphones> Ortund, it recognizes it, but http://tutorials.jenkov.com/svg/g-element.html makes me think that the regular approach won't work
[02:34:42] <gabriel9> Cork, hah, when i do this $('div', response) it founds all divs
[02:34:57] <Cork> ok
[02:34:59] <gabriel9> so it can't find by class name
[02:35:13] <redheadphones> ah, getBBox() might be it
[02:35:13] <Cork> make sure its spelled correctly
[02:35:38] <Ortund> gabriel9: $('div.response)
[02:36:13] <gabriel9> Ortund, that does not make sense
[02:36:26] <alaing> is it just me or is jqueryui.com down?
[02:36:28] <gabriel9> also you are missing one '
[02:36:48] <gabriel9> alaing
[02:36:49] <gabriel9> nop
[02:36:52] <gabriel9> it is up
[02:37:04] <Ortund> gabriel9, just append the classname to "div" in your identifier
[02:37:25] <Cork> shouldn't be needed
[02:37:33] <gabriel9> something like this: $('div.button', response)
[02:37:40] <gabriel9> but still no elements
[02:37:42] <Ortund> exactly
[02:37:51] <Cork> gabriel9: check your html again
[02:38:06] <alaing> strange cause I can access most sites but jquery.com and jqueryui.com
[02:38:07] <Cork> so it really has class="button"
[02:38:32] <gabriel9> <div id="prev-slide-0" class="prew-slide-button button" data-slide-num="1">Prev</div> <div id="next-slide-1" class="next-slide-button button" data-slide-num="1">Next</div>
[02:38:36] <Cork> ?down jquery.com
[02:38:45] <bot-t> Cork, It's just you. - http://jquery.com is up.
[02:38:48] <Ortund> $('div.button', response) would select all <div class="button"> </div> elements on the page
[02:39:14] <Cork> gabriel9: that is weird
[02:39:32] <Cork> gabriel9: could you recreate the example in jsfiddle?
[02:39:41] <gabriel9> yea, i was writing some strange hack :/ but now i need to change some code and it is nightmare
[02:40:14] <gabriel9> cork i will try
[02:40:48] <sahbeewah> what does the second parameter represent in a jquery selector
[02:40:59] <gabriel9> i gues document
[02:41:01] <gabriel9> source
[02:41:20] <Cork> sahbeewah: $('selector, variable) is the same as $(variable).find('selector')
[02:41:37] <Cork> and its what jquery does internaly
[02:41:38] <sahbeewah> where does that quote end?
[02:41:51] <sahbeewah> $('selector, variable') vs $('selector', variable)
[02:41:52] <Cork> opps
[02:41:53] <Cork> XD
[02:42:01] <Cork> *$('selector', variable) is the same as $(variable).find('selector')
[02:42:06] <Joe_S> hey, has anyone in here used slickgrid?
[02:42:26] <sahbeewah> ok
[02:42:34] <sahbeewah> thanks
[02:43:37] <gabriel9> Cork, i cent reproduce it becouse i use local web server for danta
[02:43:39] <gabriel9> data
[02:44:07] <Cork> gabriel9: how are you getting the data from the server?
[02:44:14] <gabriel9> post
[02:44:14] <Cork> .get, .getJSON, .ajax?
[02:44:18] <Cork> .post?
[02:44:18] <gabriel9> .post
[02:44:30] <Cork> your sending raw text?
[02:44:41] <Cork> that is no json or something like that?
[02:45:13] <gabriel9> no
[02:45:26] <Cork> then do <div id="data">(put your data here)</div>
[02:45:55] <Cork> and use $('#data').html() to get the eq of your data variable
[02:46:21] <Cork> put the div in the html section
[02:48:28] <gabriel9> i lost you, sorry
[02:49:59] <Cork> gabriel9: http://jsfiddle.net/djw7U/
[02:50:15] <Cork> put what you get from the server in the div
[02:51:43] <gabriel9> ok
[02:52:16] <gabriel9> nothing strange
[02:52:48] <Cork> you get the same error?
[02:53:38] <sahbeewah> what is the problem?
[02:53:53] <Cork> sahbeewah: a selector not working on an ajax response
[02:54:53] <sahbeewah> the ajax response being text?
[02:54:58] <Cork> yes
[02:55:16] <Cork> sahbeewah: the selector is sound and should work, so its not that
[02:55:32] <Cork> but lets wait for the jsfiddle
[02:56:24] <sahbeewah> so the selector does work
[02:56:25] <sahbeewah> ok
[02:56:29] <sahbeewah> right
[02:56:52] <gabriel9> im here, just go for coffe
[02:57:34] <gabriel9> Cork what error did you get?
[02:57:58] <Cork> gabriel9: you still haven't posted your code :)
[02:58:06] <Cork> so we'r still waiting
[02:58:12] <gabriel9> http://jsfiddle.net/djw7U/2/
[02:58:15] <gabriel9> :)
[02:58:51] <gabriel9> i was thinking that will update your source when i hit Update :)
[02:59:08] <Cork> that is sierd...
[02:59:11] <mehrdad> Cork, how do i check if a div is hidden? using the same css property as above?
[03:00:42] <eddyb> so I found that .width() on an element not inside the page (like $('<span>').text('foo')) returns 0
[03:00:42] <gabriel9> you can check it using js only, with style object
[03:01:02] <Cork> gabriel9: that is weird...
[03:01:25] <gabriel9> yes, and it is really hard to overide it
[03:01:28] <Ankabout>  how can I add/remove a class on my h2 element on click? http://jsfiddle.net/ankabout/XR7SX/
[03:01:34] <Ankabout> I'm assuming it should happen in the return function, but not sure how
[03:02:02] <eddyb> I need to get the width of a <span> element for a text rotation trick
[03:02:24] <eddyb> can I get an event when that element becomes visible in the page?
[03:02:36] <gabriel9> in return put something like this: $('.classToRemove').removeClass()
[03:02:45] <gabriel9> in return put something like this: $('.classToRemove').removeClass('classToRemove')
[03:02:49] <gabriel9> :)
[03:02:58] <Ankabout> gabriel9, but if it gets clicked again the class should be added
[03:03:00] <rzec> What is the best way to pass data to a javascript file?  Right now I am using a bunch of hidden form fields so that I can just pull the data through jQuery().val() however I want to know if there is a cleaner way.
[03:03:23] <Ankabout> gabriel9, what I want to achieve is that I can make the "open" h2 element red, thought adding a style can do that
[03:03:35] <gabriel9> you can add it with $(this).addClass('class')
[03:03:48] <gabriel9> but first remove from existing element
[03:03:50] <eddyb> like, when the parent or grandparent (or grandgrand...grandparent) of that element is placed into the page
[03:03:51] <gabriel9> with that class
[03:03:55] <eddyb> I want a function to be called
[03:04:11] <gabriel9> damn here is always crowd :)
[03:04:34] <Cork> gabriel9: GAH
[03:04:41] <Cork> gabriel9: its the outer elements
[03:04:45] <Cork> you can't use find
[03:04:54] <Cork> that took its time to see
[03:05:11] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/djw7U/3/
[03:05:13] <gabriel9> ah yes, i was trying with find, and did not work
[03:05:34] <Cork> gabriel9: $('selector', data) is the same as $(data).find
[03:05:37] <Cork> you want .filter
[03:05:38] <Ankabout> oh wait, I can just use toggleclass
[03:06:42] <gabriel9> Cork, my clinet just crashed
[03:06:44] <gabriel9> so i can use filter :)
[03:07:03] <Es0teric|AFK> Cork
[03:07:04] <Es0teric|AFK> i fixed
[03:07:09] <Es0teric|AFK> the markup that needed to be fixed
[03:07:41] <beasty> morning
[03:08:03] <beasty> just wondering what i'm doing wrong here
[03:08:07] <beasty> container.not(':contains("'+msg+'")').append('<br /><span class="cmsg_'+newId+'">&raquo; '+msg+'</span>');
[03:08:41] <gabriel9> Cork
[03:08:44] <gabriel9> you here=
[03:08:45] <Cork> beasty: you should preferably look for the class instead of the text
[03:08:50] <gabriel9> i ove you drink :)
[03:09:01] <Cork> np :)
[03:09:22] <Es0teric|AFK> Cork
[03:09:32] <beasty> Cork: ?
[03:09:47] <Cork> beasty: so if posible use container.find('cmsg_'+newId).length <= 0
[03:10:13] <Cork> Es0teric|AFK: still waiting for a pb
[03:10:23] <Es0teric|AFK> Cork, i am doing the pastebin now… just a sec
[03:10:33] <beasty> Cork: no the text is dynamicly added
[03:10:39] <beasty> so i need to check on the text
[03:10:44] <beasty> not the class
[03:10:53] <Cork> beasty: and you can't have a class to identify it?
[03:10:59] <Cork> cause containers is dead slow
[03:11:19] <Cork> *contains
[03:11:26] <beasty> i know
[03:11:34] <beasty> but i don't know a alternative
[03:11:53] <Cork> beasty: add an identifyer to the msg
[03:12:01] <Cork> and use that as a class, then see if that class exists
[03:12:49] <geaaru> hi, anyone use jquery tools (is correct ask about it here ? sorry if not). Anyone, it knows about an issue on use jquery tools tabs with overlay? Because when is present overlay .. tabs .tabs doesn't work. thanks in advance
[03:13:07] <mindis|wurk> i wonder what would be a good way to strip all tags from a selection in a contenteditable element
[03:13:34] <Es0teric|AFK> Cork -> http://pastebin.com/kGuGFLvS
[03:13:42] <Cork> mindis|wurk: innerText and textContent
[03:13:46] <Cork> mindis|wurk: you need both though
[03:14:05] <Cork> textContent is what gecko uses
[03:14:11] <Cork> innerText for the other
[03:15:22] <Cork> Es0teric|AFK: so on clicking .assignmt_imp you wnat the p in .wrkwk?
[03:16:12] <Cork> $(this).next().find('p') should do that
[03:16:25] <Es0teric|AFK> yes because i want to show "edit event for type {type}"
[03:17:01] <Cork> so $(this).next().find('p').data('type')

[03:27:37] <jlebrech> i want to use jquery-token-input but i'd like the tokens to not be in the input.
[03:28:22] <MacroMan> Hi, I'm getting this error: "Object [object Object] has no method 'on'" with this code: http://pastebin.com/6zqLTSgd
[03:29:05] <MacroMan> I've googled and all I can find is using old version of jquery or not included. But I'm using the latest version (1.7.1) and it is included as other code works on the page
[03:30:31] <eddyb> YES... http://jsfiddle.net/bMm3Q/7/ perfect vertical text :D
[03:31:25] <ravenzz> MacroMan well that is basically correct. so there should be an error on the selection
[03:31:27] <ravenzz> i guess
[03:31:31] <blackspotwiggins> eddyb, you should use regular transform:; as well
[03:32:04] <eddyb> yeah, forgot about that
[03:32:36] <MacroMan> ravenzz, why has it errored though? It seems valid code to me
[03:32:43] <blackspotwiggins> and i think -o- is also still relevant
[03:33:07] <blackspotwiggins> and -ms-
[03:33:13] <ravenzz> MacroMan are you running that on domready?
[03:33:36] <MacroMan> Yes, well on '$(document).ready(function(){'
[03:34:16] <ravenzz> what about the markup? is it correct? isn't there any typo?
[03:34:34] <ravenzz> maybe in the id name or something?
[03:34:37] <nFFF> The markup would cause that error
[03:34:42] <nFFF> woudlnt*
[03:35:21] <ravenzz> nFFF if he has a typo, it could be possible
[03:36:19] <nFFF> How? if the selector was invalid the clicke vent wouldnt fire :<
[03:36:23] <nFFF> event*
[03:36:34] <nFFF> Perhaps your have a conflict with the '$'
[03:36:40] <nFFF> Try 'jQuery'
[03:37:54] <nFFF> Your selector is returing an object, perhaps another library is conflicting. I.e. the library thats returning the object doesn't have an '.on()' method
[03:37:54] <Es0teric|AFK> i have a hover and i have a placeholder var inside the hover, but on the mouseout its changing the placeholder when it shouldnt...
[03:38:09] <nFFF> Or your using an old jQuery that doesn't have the method
[03:38:50] <MacroMan> ravenzz, turns out someone else had also included jquery on the page in the footer, but only version 1.6. So I removed that and all is working fine.
[03:39:29] <nFFF> :)
[03:39:53] <ravenzz> yep
[03:40:45] <Es0teric|AFK> ravenzz, do you know how to reset an element after hover INSIDE the hover scope?
[03:42:00] <ravenzz> demo?
[03:42:15] <Es0teric|AFK> ravenzz, its simple logic..
[03:42:21] <Es0teric|AFK> i am trying to do something VERY simple here
[03:43:00] <nFFF> :>>
[03:43:05] <ravenzz> mh i made an example of this for you iirc
[03:43:16] <Es0teric|AFK> something like that
[03:43:16] <nFFF> Its simple logic lol
[03:43:19] <Es0teric|AFK> but my markup was bad
[03:43:30] <jomofcw> I've got a problem : I load using AJAX a document where I want to get the #myID element. But in my current element I already have a #myID element. In success dataFilter function when I do $(data).find('#myID').length it return 0 instead of 1. How can I fix it please ?
[03:43:33] <Es0teric|AFK> let me rephrase, markup was horrible.. so i redid it and now t
[03:43:39] <ravenzz> so you want to do that on your markup?
[03:44:22] <Es0teric|AFK> ravenzz, its simple… i hover over something, change it to what i want then on hoverout revert it back… i have that BUT the placeholder var on hoverout becomes undefined
[03:44:44] <ravenzz> ok
[03:44:45] <nFFF> jomofcw, how are you doing this?
[03:44:59] <ravenzz> I would like to take a look at your implementation then
[03:45:10] <Es0teric|AFK> ravenzz, i'll pastebin it
[03:45:15] <Es0teric|AFK> i wont jsfiddle it
[03:45:30] <nFFF> You know you can just .load('www.blah.com #myID');
[03:45:35] <GoSox> i have a bit of text that is black from the body definition in my CSS file. I'm making it grey with .css('color','#999999'), how can i remove the css style? I re-set it again to 'inherit' and that works, but i'd rather keep it clean and remove the style
[03:46:37] <jomofcw> nFFF here is part of my code : http://pastebin.com/KDgH4T4K
[03:46:53] <nFFF> GoSox, just set the property to null
[03:46:56] <eddyb> how can I change the CSS to display: inline-block and then set it back to an automatic value?
[03:47:00] <nFFF> and it willr emove it
[03:47:01] <Es0teric|AFK> ravenzz -> http://pastebin.com/KcRZTBvR
[03:47:15] <jomofcw> ow... nFFF so perhaps I could use the href colorbox using 'www.blah.com #myID', nop ?
[03:47:17] <eddyb> .css('display','') can do that?
[03:47:19] <GoSox> .css('color',null); like that?
[03:47:41] <nFFF> GoSox see eddyb wrote
[03:47:45] <nFFF> that resets
[03:47:47] <nFFF> jomofcw
[03:48:01] <GoSox> cool thanks
[03:48:26] <ravenzz> Es0teric|AFK my first guess is, you are using the same var (placeholder) for each image
[03:48:37] <nFFF> jomofcw, ?demo
[03:48:48] <jomofcw> nFFF what you give to me works ! Thanks mate :D.
[03:48:48] <nFFF> why do people use pastebin
[03:48:57] <nFFF> and not jsfiddle :<
[03:49:01] <nFFF> jomofcw :>>
[03:49:11] <nFFF> ?load(url #id)
[03:49:13] <bot-t> nFFF, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/#id)
[03:49:27] <nFFF> Yea load is a cool method
[03:49:29] <ravenzz> $('.assignmt_img').each(function(){ var placeholder; $(this).hover(function(){ /* replace the placeholder */}), function(){ /* set it back*/ } });
[03:49:40] <ravenzz> Es0teric|AFK ^
[03:50:25] <jomofcw> nFFF I don't use load, but in fact I use the 'url selector' syntax in the href attribute of the colobox plugin.
[03:50:25] <Es0teric|AFK> ravenzz, isnt that going to trigger all of them firing off at once?
[03:50:43] <nFFF> :D
[03:51:10] <ravenzz> Es0teric|AFK no
[03:52:29] <Es0teric|AFK> ok ravenzz
[03:52:31] <Es0teric|AFK> i'll try that
[03:55:39] <swifty> hey, has anyone here had a problem where .css seems to be animating even though i don't want it to animate??
[03:56:34] <Es0teric|AFK> ravenzz, that kind of worked… but then it replaces the data to the item before it once its hovered again
[03:56:34] <ravenzz> swifty be sure that you don't have css transitions defined in your stylesheet rules
[03:57:17] <Es0teric|AFK> actually ravenzz, that did not work at all
[03:57:21] <swifty> there are not none affecting the div i'm working on
[03:58:36] <ravenzz> Es0teric|AFK there was a missing parenthesis in my example
[03:59:01] <swifty> oh no, ravenzz, you where right, that was the prob!
[03:59:06] <Es0teric|AFK> ravenzz, i didnt copy and paste your example...
[03:59:13] <ravenzz> Es0teric|AFK anyway it is hard to me to help you without a testcase, which mean html + js
[03:59:44] <nFFF> Es0teric|AFK, why not just jsfiddle?
[03:59:52] <nFFF> ?jsfiddle @ Es0teric|AFK
[03:59:53] <bot-t> Es0teric|AFK, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[03:59:54] <Es0teric|AFK> nFFF, too much work
[04:00:02] <nFFF> Fuck you too much work
[04:00:06] <nFFF> and you expect people to help?
[04:00:26] <nFFF> And you cant even be fucked to make a simple test case ?
[04:00:41] <Es0teric|AFK> no because its js
[04:00:41] <Es0teric|AFK> :|
[04:00:51] <nFFF> ....
[04:00:58] <Es0teric|AFK> i have no problem using pastebin
[04:01:08] <nFFF> Why cant you use jsfiddle???
[04:01:11] <nFFF> And amke a working example??
[04:01:15] <Es0teric|AFK> i didnt say i CANT use it
[04:01:18] <Es0teric|AFK> i said i dont WANT to use it
[04:01:31] <nFFF> Your a douche and I hope no one helps you anymore
[04:02:47] <Es0teric|AFK> im a douche because i dont want to spend the time to actually make a jsfiddle when i have no problem using pastebin?
[04:03:06] <Es0teric|AFK> yeah… that makes me a douche, GOOD JOB nFFF
[04:03:31] <szabyg> Es0teric|AFK jsfiddle talks coffeescript as well, not only javascript! if you're lazy to javascript..
[04:03:57] <nFFF> .... it's much easier for anyone to spend _their own time_ helping you if you make a jsfiddle, yet you cannot be fucked to spend a few minutes making a jsfiddle, so that people can actually help you
[04:04:14] <nFFF> so you dont deserve help
[04:04:24] <nFFF> and I hope no one helps you and you get stuck on this problem for hours
[04:04:34] <nFFF> all over a jsfiddle :)
[04:04:34] <ravenzz> Es0teric|AFK it is in your interest :p
[04:04:35] <Es0teric|AFK> well someone's offended because i dont want to use jsfiddle… my day goes on
[04:04:47] <nFFF> not offended, its much harder for anyone to help you
[04:04:52] <nFFF> and seen as everyones doing this for free
[04:04:53] <ravenzz> i can't bet the solution
[04:05:04] <nFFF> shouldnt you make it as easy as possible ofr everyone to help??
[04:05:05] <Es0teric|AFK> ravenzz, if i get frustrated enough… im sure i will go on to jsfiddle
[04:05:39] <nFFF> :))
[04:05:48] <ravenzz> Es0teric|AFK I mean, you posted the javascript part, we need only some rows of markup
[04:05:54] <ravenzz> easy
[04:06:01] <eddyb> Oh YEAAAAH
[04:06:10] <eddyb> http://jsfiddle.net/bMm3Q/8/
[04:06:20] <nFFF> "If I waste enough hours on this, Ill spend a few minutes making a jsfiddle" , strong logic :)

[04:18:58] <xec> NET||abuse: too much inline code to process ;) but this looks weird: .attr['id']
[04:19:33] <Es0teric|AFK> xec -> http://jsfiddle.net/EUcPa/
[04:20:13] <xec> Es0teric|AFK: um
[04:20:26] <nFFF> Es0teric|AFK
[04:20:27] <xec> Es0teric|AFK: if you have a question, please feel free to post it to the channel
[04:20:40] <nFFF> just use .data() to add the placeholder
[04:20:59] <Es0teric|AFK> what?
[04:21:45] <zykes> for some weird reason my mapping for unlock is getting the success function of pwreset ?
[04:22:04] <Es0teric|AFK> nFFF, what?
[04:22:53] <nFFF> You want to hover over an element, store its default text, change on hover, and restore original on mouseleave?
[04:23:17] <Es0teric|AFK> yes
[04:25:47] <NET||abuse> xec: attr['id'] was a typo, meant to be attr('id'); just was stream of conciousness outputting the example, so slipped up
[04:26:42] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/EUcPa/4/
[04:27:16] <NET||abuse> anyway, the problem is that object keys can't be the values of variables, they take the literal value of the name you put in they object, var literal='nicekey', obj={literal:'string or something'}; doesn't produce an object {nicekey:'string or something'} it creates {literal:'string or something}
[04:27:21] <NET||abuse> so i'm a little screwed
[04:28:14] <xec> NET||abuse: you can't do that in a object literal, but you can attach to an exisiting object using myObj[literal] = "string";
[04:28:26] <Es0teric|AFK> nFFF
[04:28:43] <xec> NET||abuse: then myObj.nicekey will return "string"
[04:28:53] <alaing> how do i set forxus to a textarea? $('#foo')?
[04:28:56] <Es0teric|AFK> $(this).data('foo', evnt.html()); <--- that stores the initial value
[04:29:01] <Es0teric|AFK> ?
[04:29:08] <alaing> forxus=focus
[04:29:09] <nFFF> Yes
[04:29:17] <xec> alaing: $("textarea").focus() i think
[04:29:18] <Es0teric|AFK> thats intresting
[04:29:54] <nFFF> You assign it to the current element, its jquery specific
[04:30:03] <alaing> xec it doesn't work
[04:30:04] <nFFF> Allows you to bypass scoping issues
[04:30:44] <nFFF> imagine a whole new universe of data that only jquery sees :>>
[04:31:04] <NET||abuse> xec.. ok, so prepare the validate().showErrors argument var obj = {}; obj.literal='value'; validate().showErrors(obj); will pass as {nicekey:'value'}
[04:31:07] <NET||abuse> ok
[04:31:08] <NET||abuse> i'll try that
[04:32:29] <xec> NET||abuse: no, not obj.literal but obj[literal] -- the first one would be the same as obj["literal"]
[04:32:49] <alaing> xec thanks thats working
[04:32:52] <Gergov> guys if i have 2 input fields and on blur i get error message if the text inside is less than 2 chars. now if i go from one to another the error messages just keep multiply. how can i make it to show only one time till the user write something no matter on what input is at the moment?
[04:33:31] <xec> ?demo @ Gergov
[04:33:32] <bot-t> Gergov, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:33:44] <Gergov> ups sorry :) ill do that right now
[04:34:11] <LukeNukem> Hello is it possible to use jquery to limit the number of divs with a class
[04:34:19] <LukeNukem> and on click of a button, increase that number
[04:34:48] <Wiz_KeeD> nobody is answering over at jquerymobile, can anyone please tell me how do execute commands on pageinit? http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html
[04:34:54] <nFFF> LukeNukem, can you be more specific?
[04:35:04] <nFFF> You can remove elements with a certaqin class
[04:35:06] <nFFF> or remove that class
[04:35:15] <nFFF> and you can remove them at a certain index
[04:35:16] <Wiz_KeeD> why do i have to bind it to a certain div?
[04:35:21] <nFFF> so yes you can probably do what you want
[04:35:49] <LukeNukem> say php generates 15 classes
[04:36:00] <LukeNukem> using jquery, we only show 10 of those divs
[04:36:06] <Guest23550> boo.
[04:36:09] <nFFF> Ok, the first 10?
[04:36:12] <Guest23550> Even in jquery IE breaks for me
[04:36:16] <LukeNukem> yep
[04:36:20] <LukeNukem> and on click of a button
[04:36:23] <LukeNukem> the other 5 are shown
[04:36:53] <nFFF> Ok so basically you need to add another class to the last 5
[04:36:59] <nFFF> that has .foo {display:none;}
[04:36:59] <Guest23550> LISTEN TO MY PROBLEMS PEOPLE
[04:37:06] <nFFF> and on click remove that class
[04:37:17] <codart> some1 help http://jsfiddle.net/codart/Awnr7/33/ the problem as the comment i write in the code
[04:37:21] <xec> Guest23550: calm down and ask your question. preferably with a demo
[04:37:26] <Guest23550> OK SCREW YOU ALL I'M GOING TO USE PROTOTYPE INSTEAD.
[04:37:45] <LukeNukem> Guest23550, it sucks, you shall return
[04:37:56] <Guest23550> LukeNukem: No dude, don't go there
[04:38:01] <Guest23550> I bet it works in IE
[04:38:07] <xec> LukeNukem: don't feed the troll
[04:38:14] <LukeNukem> Guest23550, also if you could explain your problem and not rage you are more likely to get helped
[04:38:18] <LukeNukem> also give stackoverflow a try.
[04:38:28] <zykes> noone got a clue on my paste `?
[04:38:43] <Guest23550> LukeNukem: I EXPLAINED
[04:38:44] <nFFF> So on page load LukeNukem, iterate over your divs $('.foo').each(function(i) { if (i=>10) {$(this).addClass('noshow'); });
[04:38:49] <Es0teric|AFK> nfff thx for the help though
[04:38:51] <LukeNukem> and a word of advice: Nobody fucking uses IE versions below 10
[04:38:57] <nFFF> Theres probably a more effecient way
[04:39:02] <LukeNukem> nFFF, thanks nFFF
[04:39:04] <nFFF> xec will come along in a minute :DD
[04:39:18] <LukeNukem> is pagination possible using php
[04:39:22] <LukeNukem> jqeury*
[04:39:25] <nFFF> Es0teric|AFK, did you get it to work the way you want?
[04:39:52] <Es0teric|AFK> i havent applied it yet but i will in a few..
[04:39:56] <xec> zykes: maybe someone will take a look if you make it a working demo - rarely useful to look at (a bunch of) static code
[04:40:42] <LukeNukem> Guest23550, as far as i can see, all you said is 'even in IE jquery breaks for me'
[04:40:44] <Guest23550> MY WIFE SAYS MS AJAX IS GOOD
[04:40:48] <codart> some1 help http://jsfiddle.net/codart/Awnr7/33/ the problem as the comment i write in the code
[04:40:54] <nFFF> Your wife says everyones ajax is good :>>>
[04:41:05] <Guest23550> nFFF: what?
[04:41:14] <LukeNukem> LOLOL
[04:41:36] <LukeNukem> Guest23550, listen, try the prototype channel see the users there? see the users here? Obviously jquery has more users
[04:41:42] <LukeNukem> a stronger community hence it is better
[04:41:43] <zykes> I tried with http://jsfiddle.net/NxHnM/ but it breaks
[04:41:45] <nFFF> just ignore him
[04:42:06] <Guest23550> LukeNukem: more people use PCs than Macs.. Does that mean PCs are better?
[04:42:07] <Guest23550> God no.
[04:42:17] <LukeNukem> Guest23550, join #ide
[04:42:32] <Guest23550> LukeNukem: Join #0,0
[04:42:39] <donCams> PCs include Linux right?
[04:42:46] <LukeNukem> donCams, yes
[04:42:49] <LukeNukem> Guest23550, and hence PC's win
[04:42:52] <codart> some1 help http://jsfiddle.net/codart/Awnr7/33/ the problem as the comment i write in the code
[04:42:54] <donCams> :3
[04:43:06] <nFFF> zykes codart, a lot of code, is all of it neccassary for the problem?
[04:43:09] <Guest23550> LukeNukem: No, Linux is for smartphones bro :/
[04:43:22] <LukeNukem> lets join hands for a tactical facepalm people.
[04:43:27] <donCams> linux for smartphones? ass! that's android
[04:43:37] <Guest23550> donCams: Dude android is linux -_-
[04:43:38] <zykes> nFFF: what you mean ?
[04:43:41] <donCams> don't know if troll or just plain stupid
[04:43:42] <LukeNukem> Android is linux
[04:43:43] <Guest23550> It's like a codename sort of thing or something
[04:43:50] <LukeNukem> not natively
[04:44:00] <LukeNukem> there is a native linux OS for smartphones
[04:44:03] <LukeNukem> nokia uses it
[04:44:12] <donCams> linux = kernel... not only for smartphones bro
[04:44:15] <fof> he's obviously trolling, why not ignore him? :)
[04:44:31] <LukeNukem> i like trolls :), and to win over one is awesome
[04:44:36] <donCams> fof: because i'm too bored to ignore him :)
[04:44:44] <xec> LukeNukem: and in the process spam the channel
[04:44:45] <nFFF> but your flooding the channel :<
[04:44:53] <LukeNukem> only regrets that i have
[04:44:54] <LukeNukem> T_T
[04:44:58] <codart> wth, did i join incorect room??
[04:45:03] <fof> how can you win against a troll? that's losing :)
[04:45:05] <LukeNukem> codart, did you?
[04:45:09] <donCams> omfg, don't be off-topic. so... jquery...
[04:45:17] <Guest23550> You're some judgemental people :/
[04:45:22] <Guest23550> Why are geeks so mean.
[04:45:28] <LukeNukem> need to have #jquery-offtopic
[04:45:33] <muzone> Is it possible to create a text-only version of Facebook's Like button? (I feel it's too intruding on my designs)
[04:45:37] <donCams> i like to lose sometimes... :)
[04:45:37] <codart> @Luke here am i
[04:45:40] <shwaiil> hi
[04:45:47] <zykes> nFFF: who where you answering ?
[04:45:49] <LukeNukem> muzone, text only version, explain.
[04:45:51] <nFFF> zykes, you have possibly 60-70 lines of JS, can you not remove 90% of that and still have a working example of the problem
[04:45:53] <muzone> Like <p><a href="#">Like us (315)</a> on Facebook</p>
[04:46:07] <shwaiil> Q: Can Javascript list files on a directory ? If the directory is public. Thanks for looking.
[04:46:09] <muzone> As opposed to http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/
[04:46:17] <codart> some1 help http://jsfiddle.net/codart/Awnr7/33/ the problem as the comment i write in the code
[04:46:37] <zykes> nFFF: the problem is that when i press the #unlock button it get's the success function of #pwreset
[04:46:45] <LukeNukem> muzone, you can get the group id and the like url(like facebook.com/like.php?pageid=22)
[04:46:48] <LukeNukem> and then do a href
[04:46:51] <LukeNukem> to that script
[04:47:05] <donCams> shwaiil: i'm not sure, but since javascript is client-side, i think it can't. you need something server-side that can access/see those files
[04:47:09] <muzone> LukeNukem: sounds nice :D
[04:47:09] <donCams> like php
[04:47:28] <LukeNukem> donCams, suggest them node.js if they feel to uncomfortable studying a new language
[04:47:31] <shwaiil> donCams: yeah, tks for looking. I'm wondering if, there's no PHP or other server side language, if there's a way to do it ?
[04:47:35] <muzone> LukeNukem: no need for JS?
[04:47:39] <LukeNukem> muzone, well
[04:47:45] <donCams> you're right LukeNukem  :)
[04:47:46] <LukeNukem> muzone, you will need to do an ajax request to that page
[04:48:01] <muzone> oh i see..
[04:48:02] <donCams> shwaiil: try node.js if you want server-side javascript :)
[04:48:16] <LukeNukem> but the problem is we dont know the url of the like script and how it works because facebook too does it in ajax
[04:48:22] <Guest23550> Server side javascript?!
[04:48:24] <donCams> shwaiil: like client-side includes (CSI) ?
[04:48:52] <xec> shwaiil: you might be able to, if there is a page displaying the contents of the directory, for instance
[04:49:20] <Guest23550> donCams: CSI? Zoom! Enhance!
[04:49:24] <LukeNukem> muzone, you might find out if you study video source of facebook, but its really tough lol its a lot of code in there
[04:49:51] <donCams> Guest23550: lame joke is lame
[04:50:44] <xec> donCams: that's actually the first thing he said i found amusing
[04:51:21] <LukeNukem> donCams, 9gagger?
[04:51:34] <LukeNukem> damn 9gag, it just wont let me go.
[04:51:39] <codart> i do not belive in the thing called "sever side javascript" :))
[04:51:46] <donCams> b*tch please
[04:51:58] <LukeNukem> codart, me neither, because it was developed for client side
[04:51:58] <Guest23550> Server side javascript is a load of BS
[04:52:00] <LukeNukem> but its there
[04:52:05] <Guest23550> Server side should be strongly typed ffs.
[04:52:13] <LukeNukem> muzone, i think i have a solution :)
[04:52:22] <donCams> strongly typed my arse
[04:52:30] <nFFF> node.js :>>
[04:53:04] <LukeNukem> would you like to see? muzone
[04:53:12] <donCams> which reminds me. i need to learn node.js to start making some real-time web apps
[04:53:20] <Guest23550> donCams: dude, don't be noobish
[04:53:43] <Guest23550> Strongly typed, and just generally something yo can pick up on compile time is great
[04:53:45] <LukeNukem> donCams, just use php along with jquery, go for a strong solution or mayb epython
[04:53:47] <Guest23550> Just to reduce silly errors.
[04:53:48] <donCams> i'm not being noobish. i AM noob
[04:53:55] <Guest23550> Also, use ASP.NET -_-
[04:54:23] <LukeNukem> donCams, he just knows the names..
[04:54:26] <eddyb> Guest23550: you're the noob
[04:54:41] <donCams> asp.net T_T
[04:54:52] <Guest23550> ASP.NET MVC3 is the best framework.
[04:55:02] <donCams> you are making me cry troll
[04:55:05] <eddyb> can we kick Guest23550's butt out of this channel?
[04:55:11] <Guest23550> No man, it is
[04:55:15] <eddyb> he's either a noob or a troll
[04:55:18] <LukeNukem> eddyb, is right. Guest23550 otherwise you would not have come here and said jQuery does not work in IE
[04:55:26] <Guest23550> The fact that you have the worlds best IDE, Visual Studio too.. It just tops it off
[04:55:36] <LukeNukem> >worlds best ide
[04:55:40] <eddyb> ok, that's just BS
[04:55:41] <LukeNukem> >best framework
[04:55:46] <LukeNukem> what planet are you from?
[04:55:48] <donCams> if i can kill you right now, i'd revive you then kill you again... a HUNDRED times
[04:55:54] <eddyb> LukeNukem: Microshitia :P
[04:55:54] <muzone> LukeNukem: hmmm yeah
[04:56:00] <muzone> LukeNukem: id be honored man
[04:56:00] <Guest23550> What other IDE is there that stands up to VS? :/
[04:56:11] <LukeNukem> okay.. show me the code facebook generated for you
[04:56:17] <muzone> LukeNukem: currently looking at facebook's TOS though saying "You must not obscure or cover elements of our social plugins, such as the Like button or Like box plugin"
[04:56:22] <muzone> but i want this, im gonna take the chance
[04:56:22] <chee> lol
[04:56:38] <muzone> LukeNukem: facebook hasnt generated any code for me yet - im still working on my html/css layout draft
[04:56:55] <donCams> earlier he said PCs suck.. now asp.net mvc3 is the best framework :\
[04:57:04] <LukeNukem> well generate that code please, i will show you the example and you can use that and edit to your choice the layout i mean
[04:57:19] <LukeNukem> donCams, he is really a distracted troll because good ones know what they talk about
[04:57:35] <muzone> LukeNukem: nice, alright 2 sec
[04:57:37] <LukeNukem> i like the trolls which defend what they say in a decent way, hate the ones that just spit random shit and thinks they are good at trolling
[04:57:38] <eddyb> a troll using irssi?
[04:57:45] <fof> muzone: that is more to prevent malicious stuff
[04:58:02] <muzone> fof: True
[04:58:07] <eddyb> sounds more likely than a noob using irssi
[04:58:08] <fof> which hide elements so you dont know you're liking/sharing something
[04:58:16] <ebacca> hello jquery community
[04:58:20] <donCams> i agree LukeNukem
[04:58:22] <LukeNukem> ebacca, hello
[04:58:31] <muzone> fof: I don't trust Facebook for shit though. You know I used to run Norway's largest Facebook group? http://www.bt.no/bergenpuls/Mange-vil-hedre-Lorentzen-1775639.html (might wanna run that through Google Translate)
[04:58:44] <muzone> fof: I had hundreds of thousands of members. Then one day, without warning, Facebook just removed it.
[04:58:48] <fof> but i guess they would also like you to use their branding though
[04:58:52] <LukeNukem> muzone, haha im developing a community, gonna kick that bitches ass someday :P
[04:58:57] <donCams> hello ebacca. I am jquery community
[04:59:05] <ebacca> lol Doncams
[04:59:06] <muzone> LukeNukem: hehe please do :D
[04:59:06] <eddyb> any idea how I can store something on the client, but for just the current session, like cookies with no expire time set?
[04:59:09] <LukeNukem> i mean sir zuckerberg made the first website all on his own and it was just pure php
[04:59:18] <LukeNukem> im doing all the jquery, css, php bla bla all on my own
[04:59:21] <LukeNukem> except  for png graphics.
[04:59:24] <muzone> oh like that
[04:59:29] <donCams> then create cookies without expire time set :3
[04:59:30] <muzone> thats cool =)
[04:59:34] <eddyb> err, I screwed that
[04:59:38] <donCams> oooh. html5 localstorage. try that
[04:59:38] <ebacca> facebook is all in all just concept - now that it's ipo corporate - it will be abused quickly
[04:59:40] <muzone> many men have put up a fight against facebook
[04:59:47] <muzone> i mean, tried to make something to rival it
[04:59:50] <ebacca> just like when Newscorp bought myspace
[04:59:54] <muzone> chances are one in a billion though
[05:00:01] <Guest23550> Myspace is bad.
[05:00:02] <ebacca> the bottom line is there is a need for people to integrate-
[05:00:03] <Guest23550> Facebook is good.
[05:00:06] <LukeNukem> Cmon man
[05:00:07] <muzone> LukeNukem: sure its not best to create some app inside facebook instead?
[05:00:16] <muzone> as in if you can't beat them, join them?
[05:00:23] <LukeNukem> lol
[05:00:45] <LukeNukem> not really, i went against facebook once they changed from the good old layout to the new one
[05:00:48] <codart> is there any hosting server which support node.js :))
[05:01:04] <ebacca> I have no clue about facebook - I refure to allow some generic solution serve as what the internet can provide- sure - the greater the media, the greater the need to index it - facebook in the end was, is - just A way to index social media
[05:01:14] <ebacca> there will be other means - to come
[05:01:23] <LukeNukem> code wise
[05:01:27] <LukeNukem> Google outdoes facebook
[05:01:27] <ebacca> it's sad it turned commercial so quick - 28 billion for JACK
[05:01:32] <ebacca> but JQuery though
[05:01:34] <eddyb> any idea how I can have something like localStorage, but behaving like cookies with no expire time set, i.e. delete when the browser closes
[05:01:39] <ebacca> offers nice GUI funcxtioanlity
[05:01:44] <ebacca> I like what Jquery does -
[05:01:46] <muzone> LukeNukem: well you have my full support :D
[05:01:52] <eddyb> (ofc, I forgot the question mark)
[05:01:57] <ebacca> makes web apps CLOSER to rich desktop apps
[05:02:04] <ebacca> trying to get it back to Jquery here on topic
[05:02:07] <ebacca> screw facebook
[05:02:10] <LukeNukem> facebook's jquery is one thats tough to beat
[05:02:13] <ebacca> just a screw to fill a hole
[05:02:14] <Guest23550> Facebook is good!
[05:02:22] <ebacca> Jquerybook !
[05:02:26] <Guest23550> Why hate on something like that?
[05:02:27] <eddyb> someone get the troll out of here
[05:02:30] <ebacca> ok - that's off
[05:02:38] <LukeNukem> bfrb
[05:02:40] <LukeNukem> brb*
[05:02:47] <ebacca> wait- I'm promoting JQuery and turning the dialog BACK from facebook - and "I" am the troll ?
[05:02:49] <muzone> LukeNukem: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/HqA3H/
[05:02:51] <ebacca> what hte god damned mother fuck
[05:02:52] <Guest23550> I'm not trolling ffs -_-
[05:02:56] <donCams> bfrb = be f*ckn right back?
[05:02:56] <eddyb> donCams: I know about localStorage, but I need that behavior
[05:03:38] <ebacca> ALL I know is - I like that Jquery offers a nice high level solution to bring snappy GUI functionality to the otherwise 'stuck' browser container -
[05:03:57] <ebacca> BUT everyone HAS a browser - so JQuery all of a sudden is a nice approach- - I LOVE the tabs- I LOVE the accordians
[05:04:12] <ebacca> I am happy to see a nice high level approach to GUI code side.
[05:04:21] <ebacca> it's a win - Jquery -
[05:04:25] <ebacca> a START though -
[05:04:33] <fof> accordians give me motion sickness
[05:04:37] <ebacca> I anticipate years from now - more - richer library-
[05:04:37] <donCams> eddyb: seems like a good read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4692245/html5-local-storage-fallback-solutions
[05:04:40] <fof> never liked them :)
[05:04:51] <ebacca> what is ODD though ? is JAva promised all of these things
[05:04:59] <ebacca> yet it's javascript that brings it once again
[05:05:11] <eddyb> any idea how I can store something on the client, just
[05:05:14] <eddyb> err
[05:05:14] <ebacca> I mean, JAva could bring all that Jquery brings
[05:05:17] <eddyb> damn copypasta
[05:05:28] <ebacca> yet  ? no one brings in applets - they simply never worked
[05:05:30] <ebacca> or took off
[05:05:32] <eddyb> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Storage
[05:05:39] <ebacca> and yes - I could hit 'enter' or 'return' less often
[05:05:42] <donCams> seems like you can make great spaghetti with that copypasta
[05:05:49] <eddyb> donCams: apparently there's a sessionStorage
[05:05:52] <ebacca> but - I swim with the crockford's of this world lol
[05:06:02] <ebacca> I see the light ! lol
[05:06:14] <ebacca> BUT - I want to be free of DOM
[05:06:37] <donCams> can't imagine the web without DOM
[05:06:37] <ebacca> yet  ? it's THAT the browser container exists - and is so common that makes Jquery attractive- a win, a lose I suppose.
[05:06:53] <ebacca> donCams- and that's the catch- without DOM - indeed
[05:07:01] <ebacca> maybe it's NOT so bad hmmm..
[05:07:12] <ebacca> it is after all - a STARTING place
[05:07:14] <ebacca> DOM that is
[05:07:18] <donCams> he's all cool and all in fast 5
[05:07:22] <ebacca> well DOM III now, or is it up to IV ?
[05:07:25] <ebacca> I've been out of the loop
[05:07:49] <ebacca> perhaps DOM IS the essence of 'browser'
[05:07:50] <donCams> vin diesel IS DOM
[05:08:19] <donCams> you don't mess with a bald guy... ever!
[05:08:20] <ebacca> since the birth of civilization - 'document' is key
[05:08:21] <tartan> Hi there!
[05:08:31] <ebacca> I mean - papyrus
[05:08:42] <ebacca> that is after all 'document'
[05:08:43] <tartan> I have a question on getting color value with jquery.
[05:08:47] <ebacca> so 'document object model' ?
[05:09:11] <ebacca> I suppose DOM in some regards - defending it - odd as that is for me - IS a good starting place
[05:09:16] <donCams> ebacca: nice monologue
[05:09:23] <ebacca> thanks donCams
[05:09:25] <ebacca> was thining the same
[05:09:31] <ebacca> :) = I don't get out much
[05:09:48] <ebacca> only here for a few mins then - off to listen to nutballs on eraly Art Bell show from the 90's -
[05:10:05] <tartan> $("#test").click(function(event){alert($(this).css('color'));}); would raise an alert with rgb(1,2,3)
[05:10:21] <ebacca> I like what Jquery has to offer- though.  It's about time things went higher level as Jquery offers.
[05:10:28] <tartan> How do I get hexadecimal color instead?
[05:10:58] <ebacca> like I said - Jquery will evolve into something probably like Java libraries -
[05:11:12] <ebacca> either way- FUNNY how JAva and applets just 'never took off'
[05:11:32] <ebacca> yet - JQuery DOES work - to fill the same holes
[05:11:40] <fof> tartan: http://gristle.tripod.com/hexconv.html
[05:11:45] <Guest23550> Applets didn't take off?
[05:11:48] <Guest23550> How old are you man?!
[05:11:51] <ebacca> 43
[05:12:00] <ebacca> I bought into Java when it came out
[05:12:08] <ebacca> the promise was applets
[05:12:13] <Guest23550> Man applets were quite big back in the day
[05:12:20] <ebacca> the promise was JAva could - hell- BIlly Joy's ring could open his garage door
[05:12:23] <Guest23550> Which is a shame, because they were terrible.
[05:12:24] <ebacca> JAva was going to operate your toaster
[05:12:32] <ebacca> but applets - never took off
[05:12:39] <Guest23550> Yes they did -_-
[05:12:41] <ebacca> doesn't matter about how old any developer is
[05:12:50] <ebacca> guest - hell ? really ? name me one ! lol
[05:12:57] <ebacca> planet position predictor ?
[05:13:02] <Guest23550> Chat apps
[05:13:04] <ebacca> come on - java applets just aren't that common
[05:13:04] <LukeNukem> back
[05:13:04] <LukeNukem> :)
[05:13:17] <Guest23550> Not any more
[05:13:17] <LukeNukem> muzone, so where were we
[05:13:17] <ebacca> Jquery is far more in place and functional that applets are now
[05:13:21] <Guest23550> But they were.
[05:13:25] <ebacca> I feel I am correct,  but I KNOW I may not be
[05:13:30] <LukeNukem> what is the stupid troll talking about
[05:13:41] <ebacca> but Jquery to me - has more promise than applets -
[05:13:43] <ebacca> as to GUI
[05:13:45] <Guest23550> No, they were quite common back in the day.. A long while ago I do admit
[05:13:55] <ebacca> and JAvascript is MORE attractive to me than Java is
[05:13:57] <muzone> LukeNukem: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/HqA3H/ basically?
[05:14:14] <Guest23550> But the the real problem is they were slow, clunky, and in my experience had such a tendancy to crash browsers
[05:14:18] <ebacca> I'm puzzled if you are promoting JAva applets over Jquery in this chan - or at all - period.
[05:14:50] <Guest23550> Dude, I'm not the one comparing apples and oranges.
[05:15:05] <Guest23550> Why don't you throw an ewok into the mix for good measure?
[05:15:16] <ebacca> Jquery is a damned fine evolution - and high level scripting solution for some highly functional GUI well damn it - functio0nality- I like the word function I suppose.
[05:15:29] <ebacca> guest- true
[05:15:30] <tartan> fof: Oh my, should I make all the conversion right in the script? I'd like to feed the element fg color to a colorpicker widget somehow, so should I add dec/hex conversion and string concatenation to the colorpicker invocation part? It looks tedios to me, probably there is a workaround?
[05:15:33] <ebacca> but fruits the same
[05:15:47] <Guest23550> And ewok isn't a fruit you muppet :(
[05:15:49] <ebacca> and damn if that doesn't come back to the first book Sun put out on JAva - the one with the tiger on it
[05:15:59] <ebacca>  classes - fruits - etc
[05:16:12] <ebacca> ebacca - you got it- fruits the same
[05:16:17] <ebacca> wait - I'm ebacca - damn
[05:16:26] <ebacca> new nick - didn't know I was me
[05:16:46] <ebacca> I used to have a nick here- forgot what it was - was here ALL the damned time-
[05:17:33] <ebacca> anyway- nothing said yet - just like Jquery -works - nice solution - JAvascript has a LOT to offer- Douglas Crockabelly is right -
[05:17:38] <keirlav87> You didn't realise from the fact that you typed the sentence you agreed with, within a minute of agreeing to it :P?
[05:18:04] <ebacca> maybe keir - maybe - not sure -
[05:18:14] <ebacca> I'm in deficit on some things, not of others.
[05:18:25] <LukeNukem> muzone, so you dont want it to show how many likes the page has
[05:18:26] <LukeNukem> right?
[05:18:37] <Guest23550> ebacca: I think jquery works much better than flash for developing enterprise applications
[05:18:40] <Guest23550> BTW
[05:18:42] <ebacca> right now ? I like tabs inside of tabs
[05:18:46] <ebacca> very powerful
[05:19:00] <ebacca> that alone is bonus
[05:19:04] <muzone> LukeNukem: sorry - http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/HqA3H/5/
[05:19:18] <muzone> LukeNukem: yeah i think those numbers would make this little p a bit more interesting
[05:19:25] <muzone> interactive, social or what have you
[05:20:04] <LukeNukem> well the thing is, i dont know how to pull the numbers from facebook api
[05:20:15] <muzone> oh
[05:20:18] <LukeNukem> http://jsfiddle.net/HqA3H/6/
[05:20:19] <Guest23550> Next question: What are some cool, functional jquery plugins?
[05:20:19] <LukeNukem> see that
[05:20:24] <muzone> can just put a N there temporarily i reckon
[05:20:52] <LukeNukem> maybe you can use jquery to pull data from another page
[05:21:02] <ebacca> what would be JQuery 'plugins' ?
[05:21:03] <LukeNukem> in this case, your facebook page with likes
[05:21:05] <ebacca> new somewhat
[05:21:10] <LukeNukem> and then show the likes there in the main page
[05:21:19] <ebacca> I am aware of only basic Jquery GUI objects
[05:21:22] <ebacca> what are 'plugins'
[05:21:28] <ebacca> I've not encountered this
[05:21:38] <ebacca> guest ?
[05:21:54] <ebacca> Guest23550 - you got me wondering now
[05:22:07] <ebacca> I have seen a few nice JQuery calendar objects
[05:22:17] <muzone> LukeNukem: interesting..
[05:22:25] <LukeNukem> muzone, i think you are looking for "LIKES" and not "LIKES ON FACEBOOK"
[05:22:27] <LukeNukem> am i correct?
[05:22:31] <ebacca> is that how you mean ? things that follow the nice high level scripting model ?
[05:22:35] <muzone> LukeNukem: updated the case a little http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/HqA3H/8/ so I can show it to facebook.stackexchange.com if you dont mind
[05:22:42] <muzone> LukeNukem: true indeed
[05:22:56] <muzone> LukeNukem: its for the front page of this womens fashion site
[05:22:58] <LukeNukem> muzone, we can do it in your servers database instead
[05:23:06] <Cropos> anyone have some tips about how i can use jquery ajax to get dynamic xml content that is created from an .php file?
[05:23:16] <muzone> nice
[05:23:17] <Guest23550> ebacca: You can get sort of plugin types things for jquery
[05:23:22] <Guest23550> LIke new stuff
[05:23:33] <ebacca> Cropus - I don't consider Ajax to be part of JQuery
[05:23:39] <ebacca> but - that's just me - and I'm new
[05:23:50] <Guest23550> oh btw
[05:23:52] <ebacca> I keep AJAX as a concept for XMLHTTP
[05:24:10] <ebacca> where I keep Jquery as a GUI toolbox
[05:24:13] <muzone> LukeNukem: sounds tricky though
[05:24:18] <ebacca> in concept - but again - new - and that's just me
[05:24:18] <LukeNukem> pretty simple
[05:24:20] <LukeNukem> ive done it
[05:24:20] <ebacca> always learning
[05:24:22] <muzone> LukeNukem: you mean like from inside rails?
[05:24:34] <LukeNukem> muzone, all it requires is like 20 lines of code
[05:24:49] <muzone> okay..
[05:24:54] <ebacca> best palce is 2 lines of code- then 1 - then none !
[05:24:56] <LukeNukem> ok query me
[05:24:59] <ebacca> none of course is retirement
[05:25:07] <ebacca> or too much acid
[05:25:14] <keirlav87> Cropos: what exactly are you having difficulty with?
[05:25:31] * ebacca sits back and learns from Cropus's dilemma
[05:25:44] <alaing> I have setup a ajax call to send data from a textarea to  my server and return  json. The request is being made and my server is processing but the success event of the ajax call is failing. It works if the user does create new lines but if they hit enter/return key it fails
[05:25:51] * ebacca realizes they have one more hot god but no more buns
[05:25:55] <ebacca> er, dog
[05:26:07] <LukeNukem> muzone, we will have to query each other to get this done because php is offtopic here
[05:26:27] <Cropos> hi keirlav87! i query you
[05:26:44] <LukeNukem> muzone, you can use the facebooks like button just to make users think its on facebook xD
[05:27:03] <ebacca> I think I will take one thing this morning from this channel- which is 'I Query you'  - as a cute - but functional expression I'll use in the future
[05:27:21] <alaing> this is what my server is sending back http://pastebin.com/tiK7gKCU
[05:27:23] <ebacca> perhaps IQuery is next ?
[05:27:28] <ebacca> to follow JQuery ? ;
[05:27:30] <ebacca> get it ?
[05:27:31] <ebacca> IQuery ?
[05:27:36] <alaing> haha
[05:27:39] <muzone> LukeNukem: php wont do me much good im afraid, i use ruby on rails for this one
[05:27:42] <ebacca> it COULD be the next evolutio of Jquery - jk jk
[05:27:49] <ebacca> really though - I liked it 'I query you'
[05:28:03] <ebacca> I think I'll go print it out and make a bumper sticker- until it rains -
[05:28:27] <LukeNukem> muzone, dang what a bummer...ok there is another way too
[05:28:29] <ebacca> my cheap printer bumper stickers smear inthe rain - but 'I Query you' I'm going to go fire up the GIMP right now !
[05:28:35] <ebacca> thanks folks
[05:28:44] <ebacca> I've grown this morning in a new way
[05:29:00] <IQueryYou> hell f
[05:30:07] <IQuery> I think I like IQuery over JQuery
[05:30:13] <IQuery> J is just too foreign
[05:30:30] <IQuery> I - well Microsoft has burned in the I prefix to class models
[05:30:48] <sx2020> Sup ppl.  For some reason I am not able to programmtically click() an mp3 player.... any idea why?
[05:31:00] <sx2020> I don't think it is flash.
[05:31:04] <IQuery> I think IQuery might be a good name for a JQuery object model that is one step unlinked to GUI
[05:31:39] <IQuery> kind of like GNU- not GNU - IQuery - will be Not necessarily JQuery GUI but - other crapola included... non GUI
[05:31:41] <mathi> hi
[05:31:49] <IQuery> such as wrapping AJAX up
[05:31:57] <sx2020> If you go to http://soundtap.com/new   and click on a play button you will see what I mean.  Right now I have it set up so an intermediary "click to play" shows up
[05:32:02] <sx2020> I cannot programmatically click that
[05:32:05] <IQuery> too damned many HTTP links in here
[05:32:10] <sx2020> but you'll see if you click it, the mp3 will play
[05:32:14] <IQuery> if I see the term facebook one more time ! ? I'm going to vomit
[05:32:23] <mathi> I would like to load content of a page in a variable. load() does almost what I want but it loads it into a DOM element; instead of $('#result').load('ajax/test.html'); I would like var result = ...
[05:32:48] <IQuery> Iqery will use []
[05:32:56] <IQuery> Iqery will use []'s over ()'s lol
[05:33:09] <IQuery> er, {} perhaps -
[05:33:43] <Ortund> http://jsfiddle.net/bSmRh/         <<< How do I have this target the fullpath absolutely? Currently it's getting the image path relatively
[05:33:49] <IQuery> {[(function.operand).function].property}
[05:33:56] <IQuery> see how easy that is ?
[05:34:15] <IQuery> I'll put MIT out of bidness !
[05:34:30] <IQuery> damned intellectual elitists -
[05:34:49] <IQuery> sit me down with douglas crockman at the camp fire- and I'll break a guitar string or two.
[05:35:14] <IQuery> and- as we toss the guitar onto the fire and sing in E Flat minor - we will BIRTH IQuery !
[05:35:42] <IQuery> then Douglas will go visit the out hosue at his grandmothers house.
[05:35:57] <IQuery> and we'll birth a new search engine called Yayhoo.
[05:36:14] <Ortund> IQuery, call it Yaygoo
[05:36:20] <IQuery> with plenty of Iquery widgets - far richer than accordians
[05:37:05] <IQuery> we will have Ifaces to replace face- whatever it is - that Z guy elitist ivy league yayhoo
[05:37:14] <IQuery> Zucker
[05:37:25] <IQuery> hmmm www.iface.co
[05:37:30] <IQuery> hmmm www.iface.com - has a nice ring
[05:37:48] <IQuery> facebook will pass as fast as it came- wall street will see a burning hole of 35 billion.
[05:37:53] <IQuery> Jquery will live on -
[05:38:19] <Dirkos> This plugin is not working well but im looking for something like example 2: http://www.novasoftware.com/Download/jQuery_FixedTable/jQuery_FixedTable_Demo.htm
[05:38:19] <IQuery> I don't get out much - actually- at all- I better stop typing - sorry people.
[05:38:26] <Dirkos> static header + left bar
[05:39:00] <IQuery> IQuery is next- until HQuery
[05:39:11] <IQuery> damn - I got my ordinality wrong -
[05:39:17] <IQuery> H I J
[05:39:18] <IQuery> damn
[05:39:21] <IQuery> KQuery ?
[05:39:48] <IQuery> yeah - screw I prefixes - MS camped that all out
[05:40:08] <KQuery> NOW I'm swimming with the big crockford fishes
[05:40:24] <KQuery> you just KNOW K is next
[05:41:15] <KQuery> KQuery will be so advanced ? you won't have to refer to obvjects by name -you'll have this discreet library index lookup - the DLIL - and be able to go BIGBIRG.PAINT
[05:41:21] <KQuery> er, BIGBIRD.PAINT
[05:41:23] <Ortund> Yeah, people would assume IQuery was developed by Apple anyway
[05:41:32] <KQuery> I'd think MS for I
[05:42:00] <KQuery> but - Kquery will look like this -   Tabs.Show
[05:42:10] <KQuery> LQuery will just be Tabs
[05:42:29] <KQuery> MQuery will be so advanced? You can just PRESUME it's tabs ?
[05:42:39] <KQuery> I DO so love the JQuery tabs though
[05:43:00] <KQuery> I use two levels of tabs on many sites - so much power - people under estimate the power of tabs
[05:43:52] <KQuery> MS has tabs on their system properties- and if you click one level of tabs ? it switches it out with the tab level above- so annoying - who the HELL at MS was responsible for that - and that they charge what ? $!50 an OS upgrade ? for that crap ?
[05:44:13] <KQuery> I foresee an OS that is THIN - using Jquery - or-, well- KQuery - down the road.  I suppose it's near
[05:44:18] <KQuery> I use a few browser based OS's
[05:44:25] <KQuery> damned fine solutions.
[05:44:45] <KQuery> then of course on freenode- there os #newos - heh
[05:44:54] <sx2020> help. click() not working on anchor dynamic anchor element
[05:44:56] <KQuery> Geist - he's been there throughout the years-
[05:45:12] <KQuery> worked on some hair brained solutions too- from Palm to lol
[05:45:25] <KQuery> I LOVE JQuery for cell phone dev
[05:45:38] <KQuery> well -that half breed JQuery solution -
[05:45:41] <KQuery> but - still-
[05:45:59] <KQuery> oh - I'm detracting from channel- I'll shut the hell up - sorry people.
[05:46:32] <DEADB33F> What's the most efficient way to select all 'p' elements which don't have an 'a' child element?
[05:46:34] * KQuery fires up a JAva based PS3 media server to listen to 1995 Art Bell show full of lunatics who claim lizard aliens are among us.
[05:47:11] <KQuery> DEAD- I hope your pay scale isn't above 57k regardless of geolocale
[05:47:47] <KQuery> question like that I'd cap you at 54k MAYBE 53k/year
[05:47:51] <kborchers> KQuery: the ranting was one thing but let's not throw insults
[05:48:01] <KQuery> kborch - JUST kidding
[05:48:06] <KQuery> and all respect there DEAD-
[05:48:14] <DEADB33F> Well I'm doing it like... $('p').not(':has(a)')
[05:48:18] <KQuery> agreed- my comment was innane and uncalled for.
[05:48:20] <DEADB33F> But it doesn't seem very clean
[05:48:39] <KQuery> sorry dead- I'm just off on a loose bolt or nut - really- ignore me -
[05:49:02] <KQuery> this IS the place ot ask those questions and it is truly invaluable to have such a resource as this chan -
[05:49:23] <KQuery> best morning to all- I'm off- - MUCH to still learn with JQuery - AND always with javascript
[05:49:29] <DEADB33F> There could be potentially thousands of elements so I was just asking if there's a more efficient way. I wasn't aware this channel had turned into #linux
[05:49:45] <KQuery> thanks for putting up with me.  I'm often too hyper.
[05:50:25] <KQuery> dead- if you don't get an answer- hang out - I am sure eventually someone will help out.
[05:52:47] <Trudko> Guys lets say I have element within some parent and I would like to find  order of that element . If its 1the second etc inside of parent
[05:53:11] <KQuery> I always find if I can't get an answer in JAvascript - Node 'sort' of guarantees you will be with very competent peoples
[05:53:34] <KQuery> it's been fun to watch Joyent grow
[05:55:21] <KQuery> not bad - >http://www.joyent.com/products/
[05:56:18] <KQuery> this whole 'virtual datacenter' thingy - I tell ya.
[05:56:28] <iLike> Trudko, http://api.jquery.com/index/
[05:57:00] <iLike> KQuery, what's the difference with amazon's cloud services?
[05:57:05] <alaing> how do I make a textarea line breaks not break my json?
[05:57:07] <KQuery> anyone know much about SmartOS ?
[05:57:37] <Cork> alaing: does not break?
[05:57:38] <iLike> alaing, as in <br/> elements or as in "\n" linebreaks?
[05:57:49] <hotchkiss> var myXMLOjb = $($.parseXML('<whatever></whatever>')); how can I log the contents of the xml document? if i log, i get the query object ...
[05:58:06] <hotchkiss> rather, > [Document]
[05:58:10] <alaing> Cork this is what Post response i get http://pastebin.com/HUTcRx1D
[05:58:28] <alaing> $.ajax does not fire its success message
[05:58:34] <Cork> alaing: ah
[05:58:47] <Cork> alaing: you need to escape the string
[05:58:53] <Cork> alaing: how are you creating your json?
[06:00:20] <alaing> a user enters in the comment, the comment is sent to the server where i escape it before i insert it into my DB. I then return this escaped comment back to the user where I place it in the users html table
[06:00:21] <iLike> hotchkiss, what parseXML does is create an object which interprets the XML. I don't know if there exists a function to output it back as XML, but why would that be necessary?
[06:00:37] <alaing> Cork: my json is created manually
[06:00:43] <Cork> alaing: php?
[06:00:50] <alaing> My DB is ORACLE
[06:00:56] <alaing> no not php
[06:01:01] <Cork> alaing: i mean what creates the json
[06:01:05] <hotchkiss> iLike I'm on a team where the format (unfortunately) of a spec is XML. I need to build a complex xml doc, then pass it to the server.
[06:01:08] <alaing> I'm using ORACLE Application Express
[06:01:16] <Cork> alaing: ugg
[06:01:30] <Cork> alaing: ok, you need to look for string escaping then
[06:01:34] <hotchkiss> iLike: i got it. .contents() i think?
[06:02:07] <Cork> alaing: it needs to escape the json so 0x13 becomes \n
[06:02:34] <Cork> alaing: but it also needs to escape " and other things like that
[06:02:36] <iLike> hotchkiss, perhaps. Try it out :)
[06:03:12] <hotchkiss> iLike: hmm, it then shows (firebug) an XMLDocument that I can click to view, hmm
[06:04:22] <alaing> Cork http://pastebin.com/Ykc9GtYg
[06:06:19] <diverdude> Is it possible to make all elements which in the future implements a certain css class have a specific width without changing the stylesheet?
[06:06:21] <Cork> alaing: sorry i know nothing about oracle application express
[06:06:31] <iLike> hotchkiss, click to view?
[06:06:33] <Cork> alaing: but your strings need to be escaped
[06:06:36] <alaing> thats just a piece of pl/sql
[06:06:37] * Cork afk
[06:06:49] <hotchkiss> iLike: i.e. i can click the XMLDocument label and see the doc
[06:06:50] <diverdude> like basically modify existing css-classes
[06:06:54] <diverdude> from js
[06:06:56] <alaing> thanks for reminding me about "
[06:06:59] <hotchkiss> toString, gives me object object hmm
[06:07:57] <diverdude> anyone?
[06:10:30] <iLike> hotchkiss, output XMLDocument.xml ?
[06:10:49] <hotchkiss> ?
[06:11:06] <hotchkiss> iLike: I just need the actual XML string to send in an xhr
[06:11:43] <iLike> diverdude, in the future meaning that it will be added later on? Add a change handler to the object bound to change and execute the code in there
[06:11:53] <iLike> hotchkiss, oh -_-;
[06:13:07] <diverdude> iLike: so something like $(".classtomodify").on("change",function(){$(this).css("width","100px")}); ?
[06:13:22] <alaing> Cork : I managed to get it to work. To escape " is it just a matter of replacing " with \" ?
[06:13:49] <alaing> Cork are there any other characters I need to escape?
[06:15:50] <diverdude> iLike: ??
[06:17:11] <Trudko> iLike: not sure how to use it lets say i have - http://jsfiddle.net/KEW2g/ and I need to find  what is order of bar inside of its parent?
[06:18:20] <Trudko> iLike:  and lets say that all children's ids strart same way -  http://jsfiddle.net/KEW2g/1/
[06:18:27] <Ankabout> is there a find() for parent items?
[06:18:57] <diverdude> i found a better way to do this: watch and learn ;) : http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/11/jqueryrule.html
[06:21:02] <Altreus> The docs on $.ajax say that it returns "a superset of the browser's native XMLHttpRequest object" but it doesn't have an "upload" property, which is implied by "superset"
[06:21:29] <iLike> Trudko, http://jsfiddle.net/KEW2g/2/
[06:21:41] <iLike> diverdude, I don't think so.
[06:22:14] <Trudko> iLike: I am sorry I upgraded the example http://jsfiddle.net/KEW2g/1/
[06:22:23] <Trudko> this is much closer to code I actually have
[06:22:29] <iLike> Trudko, then modify it accordingly.
[06:22:45] <iLike> I'm not here to make your projects, I'm just here to help out in little bits
[06:22:46] <Trudko> Dont know how
[06:22:54] <iLike> then learn to do so
[06:24:01] <Trudko> ilike omg
[06:24:20] <diverdude> iLike: what dont you think?
[06:32:18] <hashpuppy> i have $(".chzn-select").chosen();  which works great unless the .chzn-select is generated via javascript.  is there a way to make that a live event?  it's not really an event... maybe on load?

[06:44:29] <Darsain> what is the corect browser behavior regarding images with display: none; - should the browser load them, or wait until they are displayed and only than load them? is there any spec for this?
[06:49:17] <fof> Trudko: http://jsfiddle.net/KEW2g/5/ ?
[06:49:28] <fof> your html was unfinished

[06:52:35] <Cristen> Hi everyone, here is my question : Imagine a line of 4 images, how would you change it if the user clicked it and then reset it back when the user click on another one ?
[06:53:28] <fof> Trudko: using divs: http://jsfiddle.net/KEW2g/8/
[06:53:35] <Trudko> fof yeap thx
[06:54:23] <fof> have a look at the api page for index so you understand it
[06:54:55] <lifedodge> sup all
[06:58:43] <Cristen> 4 different images, how to change one without resetting all the others ? I wanna avoid things like case 1 : image1Highlight.jpg image2.jpg image3.jpg case2: image1.jpg image2Highlight.jpg image3.jpg etc ...
[07:00:59] <Cristen> how to write it with less code ?
[07:03:40] <fof> could you recreate the scenario in jsfiddle?
[07:03:59] <Cristen> sur
[07:04:01] <Cristen> e$
[07:08:12] <Cristen> http://jsfiddle.net/pCtNW/
[07:08:16] <Cristen> ping fof
[07:10:03] <Trudko> fof:  I was playing it with a little and I tried to do same thing for element which is second degree child -> http://jsfiddle.net/KEW2g/10/
[07:10:56] <fof> Trudko: you forgot to change the id
[07:11:00] <fof> should be c_foo
[07:11:20] <xec> Cristen: this doesn't look like jquery, and doesn't really demonstrate anything. where is the images and the markup?
[07:11:20] <Guddu> Dear all...could someone help me with this? jsfiddle.net/dvbYS/ When i type a in the "To" box and select any email then i want that the x symbol could be utilized to remove that selected e-mail. How could i achieve this?
[07:11:29] <Trudko> omg of course i did ok once again thx fof
[07:11:49] <fof> lol easy mistake
[07:12:03] <Cristen> xec it's not, but since jQuery is now implemented I'll rewrite this bad code
[07:12:35] <xec> Cristen: aha, i see. but some content to work with would be useful ;)
[07:12:46] <darias> hello, i need help with $.post, i do one call to php script, but firebug indicate multiple call to this script. Somebody help me? please.
[07:13:07] <darias> sorry, my english is not good
[07:13:38] <DerekPioneer> jsfiddle is so cool
[07:13:46] <Cristen> xec, it's just 4 images in a HTML page
[07:13:48] <DerekPioneer> i can't believe i'm just now discovering this
[07:13:55] <DerekPioneer> debugging is so much easier
[07:14:01] <DerekPioneer> testing ideas is so much easier
[07:14:03] <DerekPioneer> my life is saved
[07:14:10] <xec> Cristen: shouldn't be too hard to recreate then, you can use lorempixel.com for placeholders
[07:14:15] <Cristen> first they're grey and if u click on one it changes to the colored version of it
[07:17:37] <darias> helloo? somebody help me?
[07:22:14] <DerekPioneer> how do i get <option>10 +$49.00</option>     the "10 + $49.00" out of that option?
[07:23:20] <nFFF> .val()
[07:23:38] <crem> .text() ?
[07:23:39] <DerekPioneer> nFFF: it's actually <option value="1234">sdfsdfsdf</option>
[07:23:42] <DerekPioneer> val() pulls out 1234
[07:24:14] <bot-t> DerekPioneer, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[07:24:27] <DerekPioneer> how did bot-t know?
[07:24:44] <Cristen> http://jsfiddle.net/pCtNW/4/ xec
[07:24:48] <nFFF> DerekPioneer
[07:24:49] <nFFF> ok
[07:25:07] <nFFF> then use .text()
[07:26:14] <fof> what do you want to do with the images Cristen? highlight a selected one?
[07:26:19] <Cristen> i don't wanna use a switch case on this I think there might be a more simple way
[07:26:35] <Cristen> I want to change the first grey one to the first colored one on click
[07:26:37] <Cristen> etc ...
[07:26:52] <Cristen> but there can be only one coloured image
[07:27:45] <torpor> hi
[07:27:47] <Cristen> yeah highlighting fof, those colored images are in fact the highlights
[07:28:06] <torpor> is there some way to set the baseURL when one does $("something").load("somefile.html")?
[07:28:29] <torpor> i would like to explicitly set a different base URL for links obtained this way .. does anyone know how to do this?
[07:28:30] <Cristen> but I think it's a bit too much to reset all the other images to grey when u click on one
[07:28:59] <torpor> anyone know?
[07:31:14] <Cristen> fof I might be bad at explaining this the application looks like that : http://jsfiddle.net/pCtNW/5/
[07:32:15] <Cristen> if you click on the first grey image it changes to the first colored one(in the color list) if u click on the second grey one it reverts the first one to the grey look and changes the second one to the second colored img etc ...
[07:32:58] <torpor> anyone know how to properly use data-url with load()?  do i set this in my <<div> to get a new base url, or .. somewhere else.. ?
[07:33:17] <nFFF> torpor..
[07:33:33] <torpor>  nFFF .. ?
[07:33:50] <keirlav87> nFFF: I got the working days in a month thing sorted by the way thanks for your help :)
[07:33:55] <nFFF> var base = 'http://www.blah.com'; $('.foo').load(base+'torpor.html'); ??
[07:34:09] <torpor> nFFF: that is close, but not quite what i need
[07:34:10] <nFFF> keirlav87, lol did the one I do actually work
[07:34:22] <poppiez> I want to display a login form in a modal dialog. only problem is, the browser can't remember the user credentials as in traditional forms because I append the form. so I tried adding the form to the DOM initially and append it to the dialog without any luck. any suggestions?
[07:34:25] <nFFF> I fried my brain on it
[07:34:30] <nFFF> Nice problem though :D
[07:34:32] <torpor> i am doing $(.foo).load("somepage.html") and then in .foo, I need to have the BaseURL set for links contained within where the baseURL is not set.
[07:34:51] <nFFF> what do you mean baseurl set?
[07:35:00] <nFFF> that means nothing to me
[07:35:08] <fof> working on it Cristen
[07:35:31] <keirlav87> nFFF: couldn't figure it of straight maths, had to loop over the days - so performance-wise i'm sure its shocking lol
[07:35:36] <keirlav87> off*
[07:35:47] <nFFF> Did the last one I paste not work?
[07:35:52] <nFFF> I thought it did :<
[07:35:52] <torpor> i have my <div> foo, and foo is where i will load the "target.html" page into.  within that page i have <a href>'s, some of which link to external sites, and some which link to /somefile.html.  these URL's are being changed to file://android/somefile.html,- instead i want to set the baseURL for these shortened URL's.
[07:36:17] <torpor> and before you mention it i know about the whitelist, which for my purposes i have set to .* for now .. ;)
[07:36:46] <nFFF> So basically you want to change all links that link to /somefile.html to file://android/somefile.html
[07:36:51] <torpor> the problem is that URL's in the target.html file are either a) linked to external sites (http://someother.domain/) or are local-relative.
[07:37:16] <torpor> no, I want the url's that get changed to file://android/somefile.html to be changed to http://thedomain.com/somefile.html
[07:37:49] <keirlav87> nFFF: it seemed to be a day out on certain months, and i'm not good enough at maths to change your formula :P
[07:38:54] <nFFF> torpor
[07:38:58] <nFFF> So you load request
[07:39:09] <torpor> uh huh
[07:39:10] <nFFF> returns a bunch of html with links to file://android/somefile.html and you want to change it
[07:39:17] <nFFF> http://thedomain.com/somefile.html
[07:39:22] <nFFF> correct?
[07:39:25] <torpor> yes
[07:39:46] <torpor> and those URL's with http://domain.info/ in them, i want to leave alone.  but the site-releative URLs need to have a baseURL associated with them.
[07:40:00] <poppiez> I want to display a login form in a modal dialog. only problem is, the browser can't remember the user credentials as in traditional forms because I append the form. so I tried adding the form to the DOM initially and append it to the dialog without any luck. any suggestions?
[07:40:32] <nFFF> torpor ok
[07:40:35] <torpor> nFFF: i hope i am making myself clear, this is a very frustrating problem but i have a feeling a jquery expert would know how to solve it quickly.
[07:40:43] <nFFF> So basically load the html into a psuedo class
[07:41:14] <torpor> a pseudo class?
[07:41:43] <nFFF> psuedo element sorry
[07:42:19] <torpor> not sure i understand.
[07:44:25] <johnkpaul> Is there something special about this particular date format?
[07:44:26] <johnkpaul> 2010-11-12T13:14:15+00:00
[07:44:33] <johnkpaul> I'm trying to use the jquery.localize plugin
[07:44:50] <johnkpaul> and it requires time elements to have a attribute datetime with a date in that format
[07:45:02] <johnkpaul> but I don't understand why really
[07:45:48] <Adamantus> Is it ok to still use this cookie plugin for jquery? http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/node/1387
[07:50:24] <nFFF> torpor
[07:50:24] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/TzrG3/
[07:51:52] <nFFF> I tidied it up a bit
[07:51:53] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/TzrG3/1/
[07:51:58] <nFFF> I think that might work
[07:52:14] <nFFF> You can either load it into the psudo element like in fiddle, or just straight to the DOM
[07:52:31] <torpor> looking now thanks
[07:52:47] <johnkpaul> just in case anyone wants to know
[07:52:48] <johnkpaul> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601
[07:53:58] <Adamantus> How do I get plugins now the plugin site is down? I can't seem to get hold of the cookie plugin.
[07:54:12] <fof> Cristen: you around?
[07:54:18] <Cristen> yeah$*
[07:54:28] <fof> this is NOT a good solution, but http://jsfiddle.net/pCtNW/6/
[07:54:34] <fof> :)
[07:54:40] <Carlitta87> hey guys
[07:54:40] <ajpiano> Adamantus: https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[07:55:14] <nFFF> torpor, your issue with load is that you can't edit it before transferring into a DOM element
[07:55:18] <Cristen> so why do you give it to me then fof ? :D
[07:55:21] <fof> maybe xec can think of something more elegant
[07:55:23] <nFFF> Perhaps .get() may be a better choice
[07:55:27] <Carlitta87> wen i click on activities sumthing on the right side appears... im looking thru the jquery and im unsure where to the problem is coming from. can anyone assist? http://jamaicaholidayescape.jamaica876.com/
[07:55:28] <Cristen> k
[07:55:30] <fof> it's a start.. :)
[07:55:55] <fof> maybe toggle would be better actually
[07:56:43] <nFFF> torpor, so you could create a new element like I did in the fiddle, and load it into that, my jsfiddle doesn't actually hide the new element, but jsut do $('.foo').hide().load()
[07:57:04] <torpor> nFFF: thank you that is very helpful.
[07:57:14] <torpor> i will try to use it.
[07:57:38] <nFFF> OR $.get('blah.html', function(data) { //now you can edit data as you wish
[07:57:48] <torpor> but one thing - instead of doing indexOf, is there some way to do substring replacement?  i don't actually know the exact URL's, but I do know that I have to replace file:////android_assets/www/ with the real baseURL.
[07:57:55] <Adamantus> ajpiano: Thanks
[07:58:23] <ajpiano> torpor: use an $.ajaxPrefilter
[07:58:51] <xec> fof, Cristen; i was afk - whats up
[07:59:01] <ajpiano> torpor: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxPrefilter/ http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/
[07:59:08] <nFFF> torpor, just use indexOf(baseurl) ?
[07:59:25] <fof> i did a sloppy thing for his images thing at http://jsfiddle.net/pCtNW/6/ , maybe you can think of a better solution
[07:59:27] <ajpiano> you can write something that wil let you pre-process every ajax request before it happens and then modify the url  or whatever after some inspection of what's there
[07:59:33] <nFFF> or yea whatever ajpiano suggests :>
[07:59:36] <torpor> ok
[07:59:40] <torpor> i'll have a look, thank you guys
[08:00:23] <nFFF> ajpiano, will that work in the case where the response isa html string that contains a bunch of a href links he wants to check each one and change certain links
[08:00:50] <ajpiano> ostensibly yes
[08:01:14] <keirlav87> nice word :P
[08:01:23] <nFFF> Ok thanks Ill look into that method
[08:01:24] <torpor> yeah, i'm getting a source page, lets call it sourcepage.html .. and load()'ing it into my div.  but it contains links that are of two forms: a) http://someotherexternalsite.com/ and b) /path/to/local/htmlfile.html .. i want to ignore the a) case, and rewrite the b) case so that a baseURL is prefixed to the URL.  is a prefilter the way to do this?
[08:01:39] <nFFF> Ive always just used get or pseudo elements  and iterated over them :|
[08:01:59] <ajpiano> torpor: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-urlinternal-plugin/ would probably also useful
[08:02:12] <nFFF> torpor, the code in jsfiddle will do that
[08:02:46] <ajpiano> you could simply do $("a:urlExternal").attr("href", function(i, href) { return href + "doSomeModification";   });
[08:03:38] <nFFF> Thttp://jsfiddle.net/TzrG3/2/
[08:03:45] <nFFF> Yea or ajpianos way :DD
[08:04:21] <torpor> okay great guys, i'm going to play with this some more, based on what you've taught me.
[08:04:24] <torpor> thanks for the help.
[08:04:48] <torpor> maybe this plugin is going to work too
[08:05:34] <nFFF> torpor you don't need the pluging :>
[08:05:56] <nFFF> Just load it into the psuedo element, and use ajpiano's way
[08:06:09] <torpor> okay i'll investigate it.. i really appreciate it.
[08:06:55] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/TzrG3/3/
[08:07:01] <nFFF> ajpiano would that work?
[08:07:19] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/TzrG3/4/ like that
[08:07:24] <ajpiano> nFFF: not sure why you need a dummy element
[08:07:41] <ajpiano> nFFF: you can just load it into where you want it to go and do it there
[08:07:45] <nFFF> ajpiano, .hide() to
[08:08:26] <nFFF> if you load it to a hidden dummy element, won't it be a better UX
[08:08:36] <nFFF> therwise youll see the links changing on the page? :<
[08:08:37] <ajpiano> if you have the visual acuity of a hummingbird, perhaps
[08:09:30] <torpor> is the a:urlExternal some sort of keyword that says "a's that are external"?
[08:09:50] <ajpiano> torpor: yes
[08:09:53] <ajpiano> assuming you get the plugin
[08:10:19] <ben_alman> wow i remember that plugin
[08:11:34] <LukeNukem> how can i use .hide with .live?
[08:13:25] <xckpd7> ajpiano: do you recommend a specific backbone tutorial? I've looked at plenty but all of them seem to veer into topics that don't help me learn it (or do the code for me and expect me to understand)
[08:13:25] <nFFF> LukeNukem you dont :>
[08:13:29] <LukeNukem> aw
[08:13:30] <nFFF> live is dead :>
[08:13:35] <darcyclarke> http://api.jquery.com/live/
[08:13:36] <LukeNukem> what else can i use
[08:13:44] <xckpd7> ajpiano: I was thinking of getting the peepcode tutorial....
[08:13:49] <ajpiano> xckpd7: no, i don't know a great one that i'd recommend right now :)
[08:14:01] <ajpiano> aside from just sitting with it for a few weeks and trying to understand it
[08:14:11] <LukeNukem> ("#notifications_bar").live("hide");
[08:14:12] <LukeNukem> is this fine
[08:14:24] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: no
[08:14:31] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: hide is not an event
[08:14:45] <LukeNukem> '', 'hide'
[08:14:45] <LukeNukem> =s
[08:15:04] <torpor> thanks for the help you guys, gott ago now.
[08:15:09] <ajpiano> ?newContent @ LukeNukem
[08:15:10] <bot-t> LukeNukem, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[08:15:10] <torpor> very productive answers, i have learned a lot.
[08:15:12] <torpor> good night.
[08:15:28] <LukeNukem> there has to be some other way than to use a plugin
[08:15:29] <LukeNukem> .on ?
[08:15:30] <LukeNukem> maybe
[08:15:44] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: please stop believing in stupid tall tales
[08:15:48] <ajpiano> a plugin is not "bad"
[08:15:56] <LukeNukem> i dont want to use a plugin =S
[08:15:59] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: live/on/delegate all deal with events
[08:16:06] <ajpiano> that's what i mean by "stupid tall tales"
[08:16:19] <LukeNukem> so how i need to use it with hide
[08:16:48] <ajpiano> "i don't want to use a plugin OR LOOK AT THE SOURCE CODE OF A PLUGIN THAT DOES WHAT I WANT" is the most annoying attitude already
[08:16:54] <ajpiano> i'm so tired of hearing it :|
[08:17:12] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: you don't. new content arriving in the dom doesn't give events.
[08:17:23] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: a much better solution is to bring the elements in with a class that has display:none; in the rule
[08:17:36] <ajpiano> instead of doing it with JS at all
[08:17:47] <xec> fof: he left didn't he :) i had fun making this anyway http://jsfiddle.net/pCtNW/7/ <-- not very elegant, but at least it's clear what image belongs where in the markup
[08:18:07] <nFFF> ajpiano, the problem with some plugins are they extremely bloated
[08:18:10] <LukeNukem> ajpiano, how about when i want to show it
[08:18:12] <nFFF> For what some people require
[08:18:14] <fof> yeah weirdly enjoyed the question
[08:19:03] <ajpiano> nFFF: so what. people should prefer to look at the source and pare it back to their demands than have a stranger personally explain a conceptual approach to a problem, if they're already decided to reinvent the wheel
[08:19:11] <LukeNukem> ok i cant understand this plugin at all so somebody please tell me how i can hide an element added to the dom
[08:19:25] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: then you'd remove that class
[08:19:28] <fof> someone else suggested using a naming convention, eg -bw suffix, and just toggling that
[08:19:47] <ajpiano> or call .show() on it at the right time, either way.
[08:21:41] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: or just call .hide() on it after you insert it in the dom
[08:22:32] <LukeNukem> wait, it is added to to DOM on load
[08:22:34] <LukeNukem> then why doesn't it hide
[08:22:35] <LukeNukem> o.o
[08:23:19] <AdvoWork> Anyone know a quick way to generate a a-z list, instead of doign: vendor_letter += '<option id="A">A</option>';  ?
[08:23:22] <AdvoWork> -Z
[08:23:40] <ajpiano> who know - only you - unless you show an actuall live demo of it failing, people can't answer random conjecture like "why don't it works" here
[08:25:45] <LukeNukem> meh
[08:25:47] <LukeNukem> it works now
[08:26:57] <LukeNukem> how to code a footer chat in jquery?
[08:26:58] <LukeNukem> :)
[08:27:04] <LukeNukem> or is there a plugin for that
[08:27:34] <nFFF> LukeNukem like livechat?
[08:28:13] <LukeNukem> nFFF, it must be on the footer, like in facebook
[08:28:29] <nFFF> :>
[08:28:35] <xec> AdvoWork: if you have a string with all the letters, you can loop through each character
[08:28:51] <nFFF> No offence youve been in here getting help on your last project everyday, line by line :D
[08:28:58] <LukeNukem> nFFF, :D
[08:29:01] <nFFF> probably not the best idea to make a live chat :PPP
[08:29:08] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: this channel is for bite size pieces of help. asking a question like "how do i implement facebook-like instant messaging system" or "is there a jquery plugin to implement a facebook-like instant messaging" is completley beyond the pale.
[08:29:20] <LukeNukem> ok
[08:29:29] <LukeNukem> i think i can make one myself with ajax and jquery :P
[08:29:34] <nFFF> LukeNukem, why not take a different approach to this programming ?
[08:29:34] <ajpiano> glwtd
[08:29:51] <nFFF> read the libraries and do some challenges for a few months
[08:30:10] <LukeNukem> whats that mean
[08:30:18] <LukeNukem> i learn while i work, thats how i like to do it.
[08:30:21] <Cropos> anyone know about an tutorial for reading dynamic xml content that echo out from an .php file?
[08:30:23] <LukeNukem> no project = no learning
[08:30:30] <ajpiano> it means don't start with live instant messaging if you barely know how to hide and show dom elements.
[08:30:31] <LukeNukem> Cropos, ajax
[08:30:55] <nFFF> A lot fo people are like that, me also, but you take it to the extreme :> you get people in here to basically do your thigns for you :PP
[08:30:59] <LukeNukem> ajpiano, i like doing fun things no matter how nooby or pro i am
[08:31:01] <LukeNukem> know what i mean
[08:31:38] <Mage_Dude> Can someone post a bug on jquery for me? I don't know what's up but Trac is rejecting my submission.
[08:31:43] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: so have fun and learn then, but don't go asking strangers for help every 40 minutes
[08:32:00] <nFFF> It's just some advice, I think you'd learn a lot faster, and be more competent in the long run
[08:32:07] <ajpiano> Mage_Dude: trac can be a little wonky, haev you tried a bunch of times :/
[08:32:15] <nFFF> I fear your not fully grasping the things people are helping you with, and you are just implementing them
[08:32:59] <Mage_Dude> ajpiano: Well, twice now, but don't want to push it
[08:33:38] <Mage_Dude> http://jsfiddle.net/L8su2/133/
[08:33:40] <ajpiano> Mage_Dude: just keep going till it works, but also... do you have a fiddle and are you damn sure it's an actual bug
[08:33:41] <Mage_Dude> If you want to see the bug
[08:33:57] <Mage_Dude> And I would appreciate some extra eyes... :)
[08:34:04] <Mage_Dude> And input, thoughts...etc...
[08:34:17] <monkeyslee> I have bee looking at the documentation of the beforeSend and complete function queues. I have setup these two functions to show/hide a progress image. However if the response is cached the image doesn't appear. Is it possible to force the image to show/hide regardless if the response is cached?
[08:34:37] <ajpiano> Mage_Dude: what's the "bug" ?
[08:34:55] <ajpiano> Mage_Dude: the element you call on $("foo").on(..) has to be *in the dom* when you call it
[08:35:02] <ajpiano> that's how it works.
[08:35:07] <Mage_Dude> Click on the first [+], get alert, click on Test, get alert. Click on [+] added by ajax... no worky.
[08:35:45] <LukeNukem> nFFF, now i know what an Event is :D
[08:36:10] <ajpiano> Mage_Dude: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11342
[08:36:59] <xec> AdvoWork: this probably isn't the best way to go about it, but it's a start: http://jsfiddle.net/sjn6b/
[08:38:21] <Mage_Dude> ajpiano: So .on() is useless, and a functional .live() appears to be depreciated? I'm just upset that it doesn't work the way it's supposed to so ignore my frustration temporarily.
[08:38:28] <ajpiano> Mage_Dude: it's also completely invalid to have a <div> as a child of a <ul>
[08:38:47] <ajpiano> Mage_Dude: it works exactly the way it's supposed to, and you don't understand what that *is*
[08:38:49] <Mage_Dude> ajpiano: I could change it to an <li> instead, same effect
[08:40:02] <ajpiano> Mage_Dude: $( SOMETHING THTA IS IN THE DOM ).on("event", "selectorForOneOfItsDescendantsThatMayOrMayNotBeInTheDOMAtTheTimeOnIsInvoked", fn);
[08:41:22] <xec> ajpiano: i'm gonna copypaste that code and get furious when it doesn't do exactly what i want
[08:41:47] <ajpiano> Mage_Dude: http://jsfiddle.net/L8su2/137/
[08:42:03] <ajpiano> xec: please do!
[08:42:15] <xec> ajpiano: IT DOESNT WORK AAAARGH
[08:42:31] <neybar> does anyone know how backwards compatible the theme roller style sheets are from ui 1.8 to <=1.6
[08:44:19] <xec> ajpiano: it says missing ) after argument list and everything is pink! http://jsfiddle.net/L8su2/138/
[08:44:33] <xec> you don't know this at all do you
[08:44:40] <Mage_Dude> ajpiano: So you must attach .on() to a parent element, not to the actual element that will have the event?
[08:44:51] <ajpiano> Mage_Dude: that's the whole idea of event delegation
[08:45:05] <Adamantus> Is this valid in js? myarray['mykey']='myvalue';  Or do I have to use:   myarray[0]='myvalue';   ?
[08:45:12] <ajpiano> Mage_Dude: $("#foo").live("click", fn) is the same as $(document).on("click", "#foo", fn);
[08:45:14] <Adamantus> I know it's basic
[08:45:30] <ajpiano> Adamantus: use objects if you want objects, and arrays if you want arrays
[08:45:35] <xec> Adamantus: if you want key/value pair use an object

[08:46:54] <Adamantus> ok
[08:46:56] <Adamantus> tnx
[08:51:33] <bronson> I'm have a bunch of places that do this:           var elem = $('<div class="' + classes.join(" ") + '"><label><span class="inputLabel">' + label + '</span></label></div>');
[08:51:41] <bronson> then this:           elem.find('label').append(input);
[08:51:54] <bronson> ugly!  There's got to be a better way, right?
[08:52:58] <bronson> Is there a more builder-esque way of creating HTML elements and putting them inside each other?
[08:53:14] <bronson> Most of these seem too small to be worth using templates.
[08:55:38] <ajpiano> bronson: once you start using templates, you either use them or don't. you don't just use them for "big" things
[08:55:56] <ajpiano> i've had many one or two or three line templates in my day
[08:56:42] <bronson> ajpiano: do you use them everywhere?  and, what templating do you use?
[08:56:58] <ajpiano> once they're in a project, yes, i use them "everywhere"
[08:57:00] <bronson> (i.e., is there a 3-liner that you wouldn't use templates for?)
[08:57:05] <ajpiano> i use handlebars
[08:57:16] <bronson> ajpiano: right on
[08:57:41] <bronson> so, short of templates, the mess I posted is fairly idiomatic jQuery?
[08:58:16] <ajpiano> it's not unreasonable, it essentially is a "template" if you think about it
[08:59:09] <ajpiano> bronson: for some interesting perspective on this http://blog.fastmail.fm/2012/02/20/building-the-new-ajax-mail-ui-part-2-better-than-templates-building-highly-dynamic-web-pages/
[09:01:48] <nFFF> Whats peoples thoughts on PJAX?
[09:02:15] <bronson> it bugs me to assemble a fragment and then use .find() to stick html fragments into it...  but if I must, I must.
[09:02:20] <bronson> reading...
[09:02:49] <ajpiano> bronson: you probably could avoid that, quite frankly i didn't look all that closely at your code, sorry :)
[09:03:03] <bronson> no worries: here's that specific question...
[09:03:44] <ajpiano> bronson: if i don't have templates in a proj, the typical best go is just to string concat it all together (using + or an array.join) and do as few dom manips as possible
[09:04:06] <bronson> var a = $('<input ... />'); var b = $('<div><label>label</label></div>');  a.find('label').append(b);
[09:04:20] <bronson> dammit, try again:
[09:04:31] <bronson> var a = $('<input ... />'); var b = $('<div><label>label</label></div>');  return b.find('label').append(a);
[09:04:52] <ajpiano> bronson: i would def just do $("<div><label>label<input></label></div>").appendTo(document.body) or whatever the destination was
[09:05:07] <bronson> basically, I need to pass HTML fragments in, so I can't just concatenate...  I need to use append.
[09:05:13] <ajpiano> ah
[09:05:19] <bronson> yep, otherwise I definitely would.
[09:06:21] <lowerkey> Hi All. I was wondering whether the jquery UI autocomplete calls home each time the autocomplete is used, or just once, when the widget is created
[09:06:36] <bronson> lowerkey: you can configure it to do either
[09:06:50] <lowerkey> bronson: how do I do that?
[09:07:09] <lowerkey> bronson: btw, sweet!
[09:08:52] <bronson> lowerkey: give it an array and it will just use it, give it a url and it will call home.
[09:09:25] <lowerkey> bronson: each time
[09:09:44] <ajpiano> lowerkey:  you can also make it so it caches requests it's seen before, or whatever you want
[09:09:47] <ajpiano> it's very extensible
[09:09:54] <AdvoWork> If i have: <select name="vendor_letter" id="vendor_letter"><option id="A" selected="selected">A</option><option id="B">B</option></select>  how can i remove the selected status from the selected option, and add it to B(the new selected option)
[09:09:59] <foomarks> Running into an issue with Cycle where the images sometimes drop out randomly *after* it's gone through one rotation round. Is it because I'm setting the images as backgrounds? Working mockup: http://play.meyouand.us/120222-cyclebg/
[09:11:04] <lowerkey> Thanks ajpiano. So I take it that calling home each time is the default, and caching would have to be configured.... I don't care for caching, as I want to keep updating the values
[09:11:31] <ajpiano> lowerkey: you know that "calling home" has a very specific connotation besides "making a request to the server," right ?
[09:11:37] <ajpiano> sorry to nitpick it's just worth mentioning :p
[09:11:55] <ajpiano> lowerkey: yes, by default it will duplicate requests
[09:11:57] <lowerkey> the only one i can think of is ET
[09:12:04] <lowerkey> what's the other connotation?
[09:12:13] <lowerkey> i realize i might be asking for trouble
[09:12:15] <lowerkey> but i'm curious
[09:12:44] <lowerkey> ajpiano: care to enlighten me?
[09:12:46] <afink> what would be the best way to animate writing elements of an array to a div?
[09:12:47] <ajpiano> lowerkey: "calling home" usually means when a software product specifically is contacting some kind of registration/key verification/etc thing to validate that the software is being used legitimately.
[09:13:15] <ajpiano> like "is your product key still valid according to our system" kinda thing
[09:13:25] <ajpiano> not just any time a website makes a request for any data anywhere :)
[09:13:31] <lowerkey> i see, no I was expecting something dirty.. but that makes sense, and I think I've heard it used that way before
[09:13:38] <lowerkey> just didn't know it was the prevalent connotation
[09:13:44] <ajpiano> ya
[09:13:46] <ajpiano> np :)
[09:14:28] <bronson> AdvoWork: use val()
[09:14:54] <bronson> $('select').val('B')
[09:15:48] <bronson> ajpiano: that dom-assembly link looks sweet.  very builderesque.  I'll have to try it out.

[09:48:11] <sphinxxx> how do you force a string to be read as a boolean?
[09:48:20] <Kaan_M_32> HTTP://WWW.BORABUX.COM
[09:48:23] <pom> Is there a known reason .position() stops working as expected and returns not at all what the documentation sais it will?
[09:48:25] <sphinxxx> i have something thats either "false" or "true" but i want it to be read as strictly false or true
[09:49:06] <pom> sphinxxx: In that case you could bool = yourvar == "true" ? true : false;
[09:49:31] <sphinxxx> pom: ya that works
[09:49:39] <pom> That means if it is a string and is "true" you will have a real boolean in your bool var.
[09:49:47] <sphinxxx> i was just wondering if theres a way to do it without declaring an additional variable
[09:50:06] <pom> sphinxxx: Write a function.
[09:50:10] <sphinxxx> for some reason the .prop('checked') is storing as string instead of boolean, so when i read it it, it always reads as true
[09:50:58] <pom> sphinxxx: It's probably because prop only stores strings and converts your _real_ TRUE into "true".
[09:51:30] <D4> a:2:{i:0;s:1:"6";i:1;s:2:"16";} <-- how does one use this!?
[09:51:47] <D4> it's 6 and 16 I want, but why is it .. what is it?! bah
[09:51:50] <pom> d4: PHP: unserialize(*gibbrish*);
[09:51:52] <sphinxxx> or is it because local storage only supports strings as values?
[09:51:56] <D4> oh
[09:52:02] <pom> sphinxxx: Probably, yes.
[09:52:20] <pom> It's stored in the dom.
[09:52:55] <sphinxxx> pom: does this make sense:  return (s == "true" ? true : false);
[09:53:06] <sphinxxx> or is it correct syntax
[09:53:19] <pom> sphinxxx: Seems like it is.
[09:53:38] <pom> But your js engine is a better judge of that than me. :)
[09:53:43] <benji__> Hi, how can I know if an $.ajax has not complete because the whole page has been refreshed?
[09:53:54] <pom> You can always try your syntax in the browser console if you are unsure.
[09:54:08] <sphinxxx> awesome it works
[09:54:47] <pom> sphinxxx: However, I recommend, that if you want to store booleans as strings, use 0 and 1.
[09:54:53] <pom> It's easier for the most part.
[09:58:27] <Guddu> Zzaichik, Could u please help?
[09:59:23] <Zzaichik> Guddu: yeah, sorry had to do some actual work for a minute. I'll look at it now.
[09:59:31] <Guddu> Thanks Zzaichik
[10:03:49] <Carlitta87> any of you guys use dreamweaver?
[10:05:50] <fof> what are you suggesting
[10:06:12] <benji__> Hi, how can I know if an $.ajax has not complete because the whole page has been refreshed?
[10:07:08] <pom> benji__: Can you be more specific? What exactly has happened?
[10:07:31] <benji__> pom, like the user click on a link
[10:07:41] <benji__> pom, but there is an ongoing ajax request
[10:07:47] <benji__> it's gonna fail
[10:08:14] <pom> benji__: Okay, you have a couple of choices here, depending on what you wanted to do.
[10:08:29] <pom> First, even if the call fails, the information may very well have been fully transmitted.
[10:08:47] <pom> If that is okay for you, then you might not have a problem.
[10:08:59] <pom> If the response is critical, there are some things you can do.
[10:09:43] <pom> There is an event, I think it is called onBeforePageLeave, that the browser triggers when it's about to unload the current page.
[10:09:47] <Zzaichik> okay, Guddu, I promise I'm looking at it now. Peeps keep coming up to my desk needing help.
[10:10:06] <Guddu> ok Zzaichik Thanks for your time
[10:10:29] <pom> You can check here if any ajax is running and show a confirmbox to user.
[10:10:30] <Zzaichik> off the top of my head, it looks like we just need to delegate a click event to .remove() that span
[10:11:19] <Zzaichik> ^^ Guddu, does that make sense?
[10:11:33] <Guddu> Zzaichik, Yes.... I willl try something now
[10:11:39] <benji__> pom, onBeforePageLeave
[10:11:40] <benji__> ?
[10:12:04] <JBP641> Can someone help me with a caching problem?
[10:12:07] <benji__> window.onbeforeunload?
[10:12:26] <pom> benji__: Maybe. I have never used it myself actually.
[10:14:50] <benji__> pom, supercool, that will do. many thanks
[10:15:29] <pom> Great!
[10:16:48] <sorahn> can you use .load + a callback to just get an attribute of an element from a remote page?
[10:17:03] <sorahn> for example, a video source?
[10:17:12] <JBP641> this is my question…can someone please help…been on this problem for 2 days now http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9407850/jquery-changpage-function-wont-stop-caching-requests/9417991#9417991
[10:17:24] <nickelnick_> you could use load to call a php file that curls something from remote page and returns it
[10:18:55] <pom> sorahn: Yes, you can.
[10:19:25] <pom> It's easy, but I would suggest you not to use $.get, but $.ajax, since it has some options you might want to set.
[10:20:08] <sorahn> pom: can you point me in the right direction for that?
[10:20:10] <Carlitta87> dreamweaver?
[10:22:16] <Guddu> Zzaichik, I addded something but it did not work....This is what i have now http://jsfiddle.net/dvbYS/18/ I addded this
[10:22:17] <Guddu> $("a.remove").click(function(){
[10:22:18] <Guddu>     alert('Hi');
[10:22:18] <Guddu>     $(this).remove();
[10:22:18] <Guddu>   });
[10:22:39] <pom> sorahn: Sure.
[10:22:43] <pom> sorahn: http://pastie.org/3439272
[10:22:49] <pom> Does this make sense to you?
[10:23:37] <pom> sorahn: Nevermind the timer. Took the example from my own code and removed non-important stuff, but left that in by mistake. Don't let it confuse you.
[10:24:07] <sorahn> ok, so is the xml in the success function the same as the 'dataType' ?
[10:24:13] <tripodman> so i made a plugin to scroll the window when you drag(i'm making a web app for the new touch screen monitors at work), but now i realize why iOS and android have the scrolling that continues when you let your finger off and slowly tapers off because otherwise scrolling with your finger gets very arduous. So i'm trying to add that "residual" scrolling, with little success http://jsfiddle.net/HTJ2q/
[10:24:15] <tripodman> 1/ i think the problem is definitly that i dont know how long it's taking for me to get the 3 y coordinates and then how long i sohould take to move the page with the residual motion
[10:24:18] <tripodman> http://jsfiddle.net/HTJ2q/1/
[10:24:27] <pom> sorahn: Not really related.
[10:24:32] <Zzaichik> okay, Guddu, you're headed in the right direction. Here's a cleaned up version of what you have, at the very bottom you'll notice what I threw in real quick.
[10:24:39] <pom> dataType: 'xml', tells jquery it should expect xml as response.
[10:24:49] <pom> In your case, that should probably be 'html'.
[10:24:51] <Zzaichik> Guddu: http://jsfiddle.net/ZzaichikK/dvbYS/15/
[10:24:54] <sorahn> oh ok.
[10:25:16] <pom> success: funtion(xml) could as well be function(bananarama)
[10:25:18] <daemon> hey all how would I fetch the body object off a remote site and loop through it adding all children of the remote <body> to the local <body>
[10:25:39] <sorahn> got it.
[10:25:40] <pom> It's what you want the variable containing the  response body to be called.
[10:25:55] <Guddu> Thanks Zzaichik But the span is still not gettign removed. Do you see this behavior as welll?
[10:26:10] <sorahn> right.  ok last qustion, do I have to do anything fancy to make that run? If i drop a break point in it on the page load it doesn't do anything.
[10:26:23] <Zzaichik> yes, what I threw in there isn't right yet.
[10:27:02] <pom> sorahn: If you put the break point inside the function() call it will not break until the response is sent and returne, hence triggering the success: function().
[10:27:33] <pom> And break points generally don't break on non-operational lines, like white space, { etc
[10:27:54] <sorahn> oh so my breakpoint would have to go inside the success
[10:27:55] <pom> But no, this is nothing out of the ordinary. It's a very basic use of $.ajax.
[10:28:04] <pom> sorahn: It depends on what you want to debug.
[10:28:10] <sorahn> https://gist.github.com/31be66513e628f296e38
[10:29:02] <Zzaichik> Guddu: it needs to go like this;  http://jsfiddle.net/ZzaichikK/dvbYS/19/
[10:29:21] <pom> sorahn: Let me give you an advice. Whenever you're doing experimental stuff, always break up your code over several lines. That single-liner is very hard to debug.
[10:29:34] <sorahn> oh, alright.
[10:29:37] <pom> I could barely follow it.
[10:30:01] <pom> When everything works as expected, you can optimize all you want.
[10:30:03] <Guddu> Zzaichik, Thanks u r awesome :-)
[10:30:06] <Zzaichik> Guddu: What I did is hard to understand. Because the span element doesn't exist when the DOM is loaded, you can't simply attach an event to it.
[10:30:11] <sorahn> right, that makes sense.
[10:30:13] <Zzaichik> Guddu: no problem.
[10:30:16] <pom> Being verbose for yourself will save you time! Promise!
[10:30:28] <Guddu> Zzaichik, Right...i would have taken years to figure that out :)
[10:30:32] <sonu> Click. function is not working. Will you please help? I am trying to open alert box when user click on submit button. here is my code http://dpaste.org/ZZLEH/. thanks
[10:30:38] <Zzaichik> Guddu: So what we have to do is attach that event to something that did exist when the dom loaded.
[10:30:50] <Guddu> Zzaichik, makes sense
[10:31:28] <Zzaichik> Guddu: You'd be wise to look into .on() and .delegate() in the jQuery API
[10:31:42] <pom> Guddu: Not delegate, it's deprecated.
[10:31:50] <sorahn> pom: working thanks!
[10:31:55] <pom> sorahn: Good to hear!
[10:31:56] <Guddu> Thank Zzaichik
[10:31:58] <Zzaichik> That's mainly how you can target elements that were added dynamically
[10:32:31] <Zzaichik> No prob, Guddu
[10:33:57] <Zzaichik> Sorry Guddu, apparently .delegate() has been superseded. So you'll want to use .on()  http://jsfiddle.net/ZzaichikK/dvbYS/20/
[10:34:17] <Guddu> Zzaichik, I was working on changing it to on() and you sent this :-)
[10:34:19] <Guddu>  Thanks
[10:34:24] <titii> Hello guys, how to create new function if I want to use it like $('#header-selector h3').delay(2000).thisWouldBeMyFunc();
[10:34:28] <xarxer> Is there any way in jQuery to convert an int to the corresponding ascii char?
[10:34:34] <Zzaichik> Guddu: haha - nice, well just use mine as a ref then. :)
[10:35:16] <Guddu> Zzaichik, Would u mind if i PM u to discuss something real quick?
[10:35:22] <Zzaichik> go ahead
[10:35:30] <titii> How to extend the new function into jQuery?
[10:37:04] <ajpiano> titii: $.fn.thisWouldBeMyFunc = function() { return this.each(function() {  /* do stuff to each element in the matched set */ });  };
[10:38:37] <titii> ajpiano: why the each? that i need? ot this is just your example?
[10:39:32] <ajpiano> titii: if you intend to do a separate action to eached element in the matched set, you need it
[10:39:34] <ajpiano> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Maintaining_Chainability
[10:40:10] <Giverny> $.extend($.fn,{
[10:40:18] <ajpiano> that also works
[10:42:46] <withanx> I'm using a jquery-ui slider which triggers an ajax request when it slides.  Right now if you slide from the beginning to the end it will trigger an ajax request for each step in between.  I'd like to set a buffered timeout so that the ajax request in triggered a second or so after the last slide only
[10:43:15] <withanx> anything in Jquery to help with buffering like that?
[10:43:39] <ajpiano> ?g ba debounce jquery @ withanx
[10:43:41] <bot-t> withanx, jQuery throttle / debounce: Sometimes, less is more! - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/docs/
[10:44:00] <withanx> ajpiano: thanks!
[10:44:01] <ajpiano> it's also dead simple to do it with a timeout yourself
[10:44:04] <ajpiano> if you feel like it.
[10:50:37] <aiquandol> Does anyone know a way to remove focus from an input box without tripping the attached blur events?
[10:51:34] <gho5t> Anyone familiar with the jquery tooltip from Bassassistance, do you know why $("#tootlip").tooltip("show") won't actually call the show method?

[11:00:31] <titii> ajpiano: I have to create this function inside jQuery(document).ready(function($){, or outside?
[11:00:33] <z0ned> is there a way to specify the starting index of $.each ?
[11:00:46] <ajpiano> titii: typicall you'd do it before
[11:01:06] <z0ned> i don't want to loop over EVERY element, but for i=50; i < length; instead
[11:01:54] <titii> ajpiano: but I have to use jQuery instead $. Its ok?
[11:02:08] <titii> ajpiano: or should I<
[11:02:23] <ajpiano> z0ned: no, all you can do is reject based on the loop index
[11:02:25] <z0ned> titii, $ = jQuery
[11:02:25] <ajpiano> titii: it's fine
[11:03:32] <ajpiano> z0ned: alternatively, you could slice the collection first and then iterate
[11:04:08] <z0ned> ajpiano, that would be less efficient than just doing a for loop though right?
[11:04:24] <ajpiano> benchmark it man
[11:04:27] <titii> ajpiano: what mean fn. ?
[11:04:36] <ajpiano> $(".foo").slice(50).each(fn)
[11:04:46] <ajpiano> titii: jQuery.fn is the jQuery.prototype
[11:05:03] <ajpiano> properties and methods that exist on $.fn are given to each new object constructed with $(".whatever")
[11:06:32] <titii> ajpiano: ok, but it doesnt work jQuery.fn.ticker = function() { return this.each(function() { alert(111); }); };, then in the jQuery(document).ready(function($){ ... $('#menu-icons ul li').delay(3000).ticker(); no alert given
[11:06:53] <ajpiano> first of all you're using delay wrong
[11:07:06] <ajpiano> ?delay2
[11:07:06] <z0ned> for (i=0;i<array.length;i++), array.length is recalculated at each iteration, right? so if inside the loop i was performing slices on the array, it wouldn't ever go out of bounds?
[11:07:06] <bot-t> .delay() is best for delaying between queued jQuery effects and such, and is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function, which may be more appropriate for certain use cases. (from api.jquery.com/delay/ )
[11:07:16] <titii> ajpiano: why? here $('#header-selector h3').delay(3000).fadeIn(3000); it works
[11:07:25] <ajpiano> z0ned: you should cache the .length you're using before th loop
[11:07:38] <ajpiano> titii: because .fadeIn is a queued animation, which is exactly what delay is designed to work with
[11:08:02] <z0ned> ajpiano, as i said i am (potentially) slicing the array within the loop, so i think i actually want the length to be recalculated. just checking that this was in fact the default behavior?
[11:08:18] <ajpiano> that just doesn't like a good idea :/
[11:08:52] <titii> ajpiano: hmmm but how to create a function for some object $ with some delay, after some seconeds after document load
[11:09:06] <ajpiano> ?mdc setTimeout @ titii
[11:09:07] <bot-t> titii, window.setTimeout - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout
[11:10:46] <titii> ajpiano: Ha,,, but i try to $('#menu-icons ul li').ticker(); without delay, the alert wasnt promted too
[11:10:59] <ajpiano> titii: maybe your selector isn't matching, who knows
[11:11:05] <ajpiano> titii: no one can debug your code without a live demo
[11:11:36] <titii> ajpiano: ou shit U right, selector is wrong, sorry >|
[11:15:04] <titii> How to get HTML inside object? $(..).value() ?
[11:15:29] <ajpiano> ?html
[11:15:30] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[11:15:35] <withanx> it looks like deb ounce only works on object events, I need to immediately update some text when the slider moves, but debounce another function that I call from the event function
[11:15:40] <withanx> debounce*
[11:15:41] <ajpiano> titii: please don't sit here all day asking every question that pops into your head
[11:15:56] <ajpiano> please use the documentation and do research before asking
[11:16:22] <ajpiano> withanx: a manual timeout would be very straightforward
[11:16:44] <withanx> ajpiano: timeout isn't really what I want though since it would still trigger all of them
[11:16:46] <CodeZombie> hey guys, I'm having an odd issue with jquery ui, and css3 transform scale. The scaled div has child elements that are draggable. When draggable is activated after the scale has been performed, the dragging position is off by quite a bit. jsfiddle is being really slow for me, so I thought I'd just give a quick clip to show the behavior: http://f.cl.ly/items/1P35431x470g032t3u1Q/Screen%20Recording%204.mov Has anyone been able to work around something li
[11:17:09] <ajpiano> withanx: as would using the "stop" even for something you want to happen when sliding stops :)
[11:17:24] <withanx> hmm
[11:17:43] <ajpiano> withanx: you are assuming i know what "all of them" means
[11:17:46] <withanx> lol
[11:17:48] <withanx> oops
[11:17:54] <withanx> yeah, the stop event looks good
[11:19:40] <squeakytoy> Hey all. Is there a recommended/decent framework for websockets in jquery?
[11:20:09] <titii> ajpiano: ok sorry, but why the css is not a function in jQuery.fn.ticker = function(){ return this.each(function(){ this.css('color', 'red'); }); };
[11:20:26] <ajpiano> titii: inside of the each loop, 'this' is a DOM element
[11:20:34] <ajpiano> you have to do $(this).css("color", "red")
[11:23:24] <titii> ajpiano: but now the $ is not a fuinction
[11:23:41] <ajpiano> titii: you have to debug your own code, this channel is not a venue for hand-holding

[11:35:58] <pflock> how can I give every div a different position if I want to add a lot of div's that have the same class?
[11:36:06] <ajpiano> do your ajax request manually, .unshift() the data onto the returned results, and then pass it along
[11:36:38] <ajpiano> ag4ve: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp this demo shows the fundamental approach
[11:37:03] <\logic> pflock use selector, and next() with css({})

[11:40:25] <ag4ve> eh, a line prepended to the search results list that says that....
[11:40:39] <pflock> \logic: so will $("div#mydiv").next().css() always add a new div with the position?

[11:42:36] <CodeZombie> can anyone give me an idea of what to do to fix dragging in this situation? http://jsfiddle.net/8T3wB/3/
[11:43:03] <CodeZombie> the dragged object is being scaled by transform on the parent, which is causing the dragged object to be misplaced during the drag

[11:44:34] <nylinuxhelp> Hi, does anyone have a fiddle url or workaround for Windows IE7 lack of support for "forEach" and "each" iterations?
[11:45:22] <ajpiano> nylinuxhelp: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
[11:45:30] <nylinuxhelp> I'm looking to disable all-but-one <option> within a select. I don't want to disable the entire select element.
[11:45:37] <nylinuxhelp> thanks ajpiano, I'll look at it.
[11:50:36] <nylinuxhelp> Seems that in IE7, you can disable an entire SELECT element, but not the individual option tags.
[11:51:14] <nylinuxhelp> ajpiano, I followed the directions to add in the ECMA-262 handler. Did not change anything
[11:51:25] <yndpt> that sux
[11:51:28] <nylinuxhelp> of course, it didn't throw the "object not supported" error
[11:51:29] <ajpiano> i don't know what "anything" is in this situation
[11:51:33] <nylinuxhelp> which is a benefit
[11:52:08] <nylinuxhelp> well, the goal is to disable "all but one" option tag. Works everywhere (so far) except for IE7
[11:52:09] <ajpiano> nylinuxhelp: feel free to step debug into the impl, i can't spend a lot of time beyond referring you to it
[11:52:11] <ajpiano> what the heck
[11:52:20] <ajpiano> nylinuxhelp: how are these two things related
[11:52:42] <nylinuxhelp> basically I don't want you to debug anything
[11:52:53] <ajpiano> great, me neither!
[11:53:02] <ajpiano> you don't need Array.prototype.forEach to try and hack the disabled situation, so far as i can tell
[11:53:17] <nylinuxhelp> i see.
[11:53:52] <nylinuxhelp> without that code though, IE7 throws an error. I think the unfortunate reality is that in IE7, you can disable an option tag.
[11:54:01] <nylinuxhelp> you can, however, disable the entire SELECT element.
[11:54:08] <nylinuxhelp> which is not what i want to do
[11:54:54] <nylinuxhelp> I guess it will have to be disable the whole thing, and then, on "submit" click, re-enable it.
[11:54:57] <nylinuxhelp> booo...
[11:54:59] <ajpiano> ie7 throws an error when you do *what*
[11:55:19] <nylinuxhelp> in ie7, if you call a forEach in Jquery, it throws an error
[11:55:38] <ajpiano> there is no forEach in jQuery
[11:55:48] <nylinuxhelp> not jQuery, I mean, javascript
[11:56:00] <ajpiano> so don't use forEach
[11:56:09] <ajpiano> if you have to support ie7
[11:56:17] <nylinuxhelp> sadly, yes, I have to support ie7
[11:56:40] <eddyb> is there a way I can bind function arguments, but not "this"?
[11:57:40] <nylinuxhelp> the problem is not really in how to iterate, but the inability to disable a discrete option tag.
[11:58:59] <ajpiano> which seems to be fundamentally impossible in ie7
[11:59:04] <ajpiano> http://www.gtalbot.org/BrowserBugsSection/MSIE7Bugs/OptionDisabledSupport.html
[11:59:32] <ajpiano> looks like there are some approaches to workarounds linked from there though

[12:00:23] <ajpiano> i'm great
[12:00:28] <bartmax> awesome
[12:00:37] <CodeZombie> man, this is driving me nuts
[12:00:49] <ajpiano> you know, just sitting here waiting for you to ask me about some outrageously specific issue that you probably have
[12:01:05] <bartmax> hahahahha not really, I had some time ago but right now im doing great :)
[12:01:10] <ajpiano> heh, yay
[12:01:11] <bartmax> just wanted to hello you
[12:01:14] <ajpiano> :)
[12:01:41] <bartmax> either way, I liked how you tagged my question as : outrageously specific issue
[12:01:42] <nylinuxhelp> ok, so you're saying not to ask specific issue questions. great
[12:01:45] <bartmax> kinda feels great :)
[12:02:01] <ajpiano> nylinuxhelp: that's not what i'm saying at all.
[12:02:21] <bartmax> i do have a general concern tho.
[12:02:25] <bartmax> so I will ask hehehe
[12:02:29] <nylinuxhelp> well, ajpiano, you seem upset about finding stuff in google that I didn't find. I didn't leave the googling to you. I did some first
[12:02:33] <nylinuxhelp> your results were better
[12:02:40] <nylinuxhelp> so I do thank you for your efforts
[12:02:45] <ajpiano> nylinuxhelp: i googled "disabled option ie7"
[12:03:25] <thomas> have a html code: <fieldset><legend>test</legend><input name="test" value="blub" /><div style="opacity: 1;" class="picker"></div></fieldset>  - have multiple fieldsets
[12:03:57] <thomas> when i click in example inputfield "test" then i like show test in the div with the class "picker"
[12:04:03] <thomas> but only in this current fieldset
[12:04:05] <thomas> is it posible?
[12:04:13] <bartmax> let's see i have some initializators like : $('.someclass').mySuperDupperPluginInit(); and then, i load a page via ajax, so the superdupperplugininitialization doesn't trigger even .someclass are in that page. I can use live, but not without an event. What do you suggest in this scenario (even if suggestion change the overall logic) ?
[12:04:18] <ajpiano> nylinuxhelp: i'm not frustrated at you, i am just having a couple days right now where i am really blown away by the fact that people show up with a whole bunch of code they've been working on for awhile, and then expect a stranger to look at it for 30 seconds and instantly have more insight into it than they do
[12:04:31] <KOServal> Hi everyone. Does anyone know where I can find a script that display a black foreground (like in galleries when clicking a picture to view it larger) and thus hide the rest of the page ?
[12:04:34] <thomas> ajpiano: can you me help me? the last one :-)
[12:04:37] <nylinuxhelp> ajpiano, i understand.
[12:04:59] <nylinuxhelp> it's all good. My googling was not specific. and I paid for it :)
[12:05:26] <antipattern> thomas: do you have code that you're having trouble with? or are you asking "how do i do this"?
[12:05:29] <nylinuxhelp> but what I like about jquery is that sometimes, someone has worked on a similar issue and has a fiddle URL where they solved it
[12:05:31] <bartmax> KOServal, search for modal gallery in google
[12:05:48] <nylinuxhelp> can't hurt to ask, when there are close to a thousand users in this channel at the moment
[12:05:58] <ajpiano> thomas: $(this).next().text("whatever")
[12:05:58] <thomas> antipattern: sorry, yes. how i do it?
[12:06:12] <thomas> ajpiano: yes, but is not always the next
[12:06:28] <ajpiano> .nextAll("div").first().text();
[12:06:45] <KOServal> Thanks bartmax ! I don't really need a gallery but just the hidding black foreground. I don't know how this is called so I don't manage to do an efficient search :P
[12:06:53] <ajpiano> thomas: don't show people html, say 'this is how it is' and then when someone gives you an answer, say 'it isn't actually like that."
[12:06:55] <thomas> ajpiano: also posible with nextall(#picker) ?
[12:06:55] <bartmax> ajpiano / thomas: .next('.picker').text();
[12:07:16] <bartmax> KOServal: Modal is the keyword you are looking for
[12:07:35] <KOServal> Thanks a lot bartmax :)
[12:07:52] <ajpiano> bartmax: some kind of lazy-loading approach like the one here is somewhat workable, http://enterprisejquery.com/2010/07/configuring-ui-widgets-and-interactions-with-live/
[12:08:25] <bartmax> kinda don't like  'kind of' - 'somewhat workable'... :(
[12:08:39] <bartmax> im reading tho :D
[12:08:43] <bartmax> ty
[12:08:58] <ajpiano> bartmax: i say things like that this way you don't hold me responsible for saying "it will definitely work for you, no problem!!"
[12:12:58] <bartmax> ajpiano: not very elegant, what do you think of the solution ?
[12:13:11] <ajpiano> bartmax: i'm not a huge fan of it
[12:13:29] <bartmax> also, it have problems on .autocomplete for example
[12:13:30] <ajpiano> bartmax: i have a very less jquery-centric approach to a problem like that
[12:13:45] <bartmax> when you need to alter inputs withouth interaction
[12:13:53] <ajpiano> i would be inserting a logical component into a page, and know when it's happening, and it would have its own init logic
[12:13:53] <bartmax> bartmax: what is ?
[12:14:02] <ajpiano> which would take care of hooking up that kinda shit
[12:14:10] <ajpiano> ala backbone
[12:14:29] <bartmax> something like <script tag> in ajax loaded views ?
[12:14:45] <ajpiano> no
[12:14:59] <ajpiano> having views that are not just strings of html but actually like ... Views...
[12:15:13] <ajpiano> so that when a new one is created, it has the opportunity to run some JS
[12:16:30] <bartmax> mmm im using razor mvc, how can i run JS without doing <script>someFunction()</script> in the view or using onSuccess??
[12:16:55] <ch3mical> When using deferreds, if you have stored the promise in a var, how would you call a reject on that?
[12:16:56] <ajpiano> i have no idea, i'm not familiar with the framework
[12:17:14] <ajpiano> ch3mical: you can't call reject on the actual promise, only on the deferred itself.
[12:17:19] <ch3mical> Right
[12:17:25] <ch3mical> That's the problem
[12:17:32] <ajpiano> var dfd = $.Deferred();  dfd.reject();  return dfd.promise();
[12:17:34] <ch3mical> So how do I get back to the deferred from there
[12:17:39] <ajpiano> you don't
[12:17:58] <ajpiano> the whole point of promises is that only the thing that actually is in control of the behaviour can decide to reject/resolve it
[12:18:09] <ajpiano> and consumers can only wait for those things to happen, they can't *make* those things happen
[12:18:25] <fission6> is there a recommended carasoul plugin where i can fadein and fade out - i am using twitter bootstrap carasousel and it just slides
[12:18:56] <bartmax> ajpiano: didn't understand your 'ala backbone' :(
[12:19:01] <CodeZombie> has noone gotten draggable + transform scale working properly? I see bug reports for it, but with no response as to a fix, nor a work around.
[12:19:06] <ajpiano> i meant "like Backbone.js works"
[12:19:16] <bartmax> damn, don't know how that works :S
[12:19:28] <ch3mical> Well here's what I'm trying to do. I have created $.fn.animatePromise = function(prop, opt, callback) { ... this returns the promise } then I do var someAnimation = $('whatever').animatePromise(...) and I want to be able to reject the deferred at some point to stop the execution of my defferend done callback
[12:19:33] <ch3mical> If that makes sense lol
[12:19:39] <ajpiano> bartmax: it means that if i had an element that needed to have a datepicker control or something, i'd have an Appointment model, for instance.
[12:19:40] <CodeZombie> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6844
[12:19:45] <aaairc> has anyone used a soundcloud player on their website? could you recommend a jquery plugin?
[12:19:48] <ajpiano> that would in turn have a view associated with it
[12:19:55] <CodeZombie> over a year old... blah
[12:20:04] <ajpiano> when i created a new Appointment, it would create a new view and stick it in the dom, and activate the datepicker in that view.
[12:20:11] <ch3mical> deferred*
[12:20:32] <bartmax> ajpiano: i see... so logic JS is in the 'View' per se
[12:20:44] <ajpiano> yes
[12:21:02] <ajpiano> this way it's not like this crazy top down QUERY THE DOM AND ACTIVATE SOME WIDGETS shit
[12:21:17] <bartmax> in practice, isn't that having a <script>$('.datepicke').datepicker()</script> in the AppointmentView ?
[12:21:36] <ajpiano> ch3mical: sounds like you just need a wrapping deferred to control the behaviour
[12:21:57] <ch3mical> Yeah, sounds logical, but where do you suggest I handle that
[12:22:13] <ajpiano> bartmax: in the same sense that like scraping food out the bottom of a dumpster and having a 5 course meal served to you at a deluxe restaurant are both "eating."
[12:22:16] <bartmax> ajpiano: or just call AppointmentInit() and that in a function global main.js file for example, and load in the onsuccess
[12:22:28] <ch3mical> Basically I want to be able to stop any deferred created by $.fn.animatePromise
[12:22:54] <ajpiano> ch3mical: if you want to be able to reject it from outisde, just return a dferred instead of a promise
[12:23:20] <ch3mical> Hmm
[12:24:04] <\logic> using $.ajax() & $.post or $.get function(callback) , callback data outputs whole .tpl file output, not the .php page in smarty.... looks like a bug
[12:24:40] <\logic> or am I doing something wrong? tested it in jquery-1.6.2.min > 1.6.4
[12:24:41] <ch3mical> ajpiano, would that change the syntax of $.when(myAnimatePromise).done(...) ?
[12:25:14] <ch3mical> Assuming myAnimatePromise used to be the promise object and now will become the defer object
[12:25:25] <sweb> how can i get jsonp data from loaded iframe ?
[12:25:27] <ajpiano> ch3mical: nope
[12:25:28] <ajpiano> shouldn't
[12:25:42] <ch3mical> ok, let's see what happens then
[12:27:23] <ch3mical> Doesn't seem to fire the done callback now
[12:27:38] <ch3mical> Let me see if I can get a jsFiddle set up
[12:27:52] <bartmax> ajpiano: i don't like scraping foot, i like the elegant (deluxe restaurant) implementation. What would be? Having a function to initialize a View on onsuccess?
[12:28:21] <ajpiano> bartmax: that would be very very dependent on your app and i can't conjecture about that
[12:29:28] <bartmax> ajpiano: mmm what are the options? I know about 2 (onSuccess with a bunch of functions to initialize all 'ajax-loaded-view' (it's a heavy instense partial ajax loaded forms and stuff. and the other option is to have in the view an ungly unmaintainable <script /> tag. Is there any other option/way ?
[12:30:05] <\logic> I just had to make use a different php page not having smarty instances to make it work :)...
[12:30:19] <ajpiano> bartmax: and the other option is client side mvc approach :)
[12:30:20] <\logic> s/make use a/make use of/
[12:30:40] <bartmax> ajpiano: any lecture on that? something to read? :D
[12:30:48] <cropos> is it possible to read an hiddenbox like div? document.getElementById("hiddenbox");
[12:30:54] <bartmax> or just google mvc js ?
[12:30:59] <ajpiano> http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/
[12:31:07] <ajpiano> bartmax: there's a lot out there
[12:31:11] <bartmax> ty ajpiano
[12:31:23] <bartmax> you've been of HUUUUGEEE help.
[12:31:31] <bartmax> as usual, but WAY MORE :D
[12:32:09] <ajpiano> :)
[12:33:09] <cropos> hi guys, can you read hidden box element like div? document.getElementById("hiddenbox"); ?
[12:33:40] <k0rnel> hi guys. is there someone that could vote for me on forrst? http://forrst.com/i/Bbu  if it don't bother you.. don't have any public repo.. I made first html/css layout for https://aukcie.trencin.sk/ (it's changed now little bit by them), http://host4web.sk (also little bit changed) and so on
[12:34:13] <ajpiano> k0rnel: in the kindest way possible, that type of thing simply isn't appropriate for a large public irc channel
[12:34:37] <k0rnel> ajpiano: ok, sorry then
[12:36:48] <ch3mical> ajpiano, would you mind having a look? http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/bkdMT/6/
[12:37:31] <ch3mical> So the animated element should pulsate and fade out only if the slide animation wasn't interrupted by the event firing again
[12:37:31] <ajpiano> ch3mical: you know that in jquery 1.6 you can pluck the promise out of anything that's been animated anyway
[12:37:33] <ajpiano> right?
[12:37:53] <ch3mical> I thought that was the case, but I couldn't find documentation on it
[12:38:07] <ajpiano> var promise = $("#foo").animate( parms, 1000).promise();
[12:38:15] <ch3mical> Oh cool
[12:38:38] <ajpiano> so you can just late-bind animation callbacks whenever you want without having to manually write dfds yourself
[12:38:57] <ch3mical> Hmm now I'll have to try that approach
[12:39:21] <ch3mical> Do you have a quick example?
[12:39:27] <bartmax> ajpiano: i want to go somewhere where you can teach me JS...
[12:39:30] <bartmax> ajpiano: is that possible ?
[12:39:45] <ajpiano> bartmax: let's do a cult suicide together
[12:39:51] <ajpiano> and we can spent all of eternity on it
[12:39:54] <ajpiano> :D
[12:39:58] <nickelnick> whats happnin dudes
[12:39:59] <ajpiano> ch3mical: i just gave you one :p
[12:40:19] <ch3mical> Yeah I mean how would I apply it to my situation I guess
[12:40:42] <bartmax> ajpiano: mmm... cult suicide ... other way ? :D
[12:40:52] <ch3mical> I think I got myself all turned around trying to manually set the dfd
[12:40:55] <ajpiano> ch3mical: i really can't, i need to get out of here for now, been neglecting too  much real work today
[12:41:01] <ch3mical> ah ok
[12:41:06] <ch3mical> No worries, I'll figure it out
[12:41:12] <tw2113> real work?
[12:41:12] <ch3mical> Thanks for the info
[12:42:32] <pflock> can I wait for an event (click-event) at a point of a function?
[12:44:07] <nickelnick> hey guys, i'm looking for a way to restructure this part of a star rating so that i dont have to redeclare $selc
[12:44:10] <nickelnick> $self
[12:44:11] <nickelnick> http://pastie.org/3440332
[12:55:22] <JAAulde> With the unification of the event API, is there any change to the use of `.trigger()` to fire an event? Or is that stull the way to do it?
[12:55:32] <pflock> can I wait for a click-event somehow?
[12:56:18] <logic> before an event?
[12:59:36] <pflock> logic: Yes
[13:00:21] <logic> pflock delay();
[13:08:17] <bartmax> ajpiano: i hate you ... there's a lot i must read about client-mvc
[13:08:27] <bartmax> and don't see a good integration with M$
[13:11:21] <bartmax> actually ppl say it's not worth it to use mvc client + mvc server.
[13:13:33] <shamess> Working on a plugin with settings as described in the "plugin authoring" docs. Doing $.extend(settings, options); overrides the default settings permanently though.. Is that expected?
[13:15:08] <bartmax> shamess: yup
[13:15:11] <shamess> For instance, if settings.a="foo"; and then I do $.myplugin({a:"bar"}), then a correctly gets set to "foo". But if I do $.myplugin() i'd want settings.a to be "foo" again..
[13:16:00] <glacius__> anyone use beauty tips? I have a question about loading images
[13:17:00] <shamess> Hmm.. I'll just put my settings object in the extend method..
[13:19:08] <ch3mical> Animations are a fucking pain in the ass
[13:19:12] <ch3mical> ugh
[13:19:47] <BillCriswell> I have a form that may need to do a couple different tests before it's submitted. Is it better practice to do $('form').on('submit', function() { // Put all my tests in here }); or would it be better to has $('form').on('submit', function() { // One Test }); and do $('form').on('submit', function() { // Another test }); when I need to? Is there a downside to having multiple functions called on s
[13:19:48] <BillCriswell> ubmit vs just one larger one?
[13:20:18] <JBP641> can someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong on line 9 of this? http://pastebin.com/bVVG3gMC
[13:20:59] <nFFF> jbp
[13:21:07] <nFFF> what does content return?
[13:21:13] <nFFF> console.log() it
[13:21:42] <shamess> JBP641: What makes you think you're doing something wrong?
[13:21:51] <nFFF> and see if thats what you want to be passing to the ajax call
[13:21:56] <shamess> JBP641: Have you looked at what data the ajax call is sending?
[13:22:05] <BillCriswell> JBP641: You just have a syntax error.
[13:22:07] <peterschmidler> How do I get the amount of <div class="text">…<div> on a page?
[13:22:22] <JBP641> it works if I manually substitute for "content"
[13:22:26] <JBP641> Bill what's that?
[13:22:28] <shamess> peterschmidler: $('div.text').length
[13:22:31] <davistv> Hi Everyone. I'm trying to use .load() to monitor when an image has completed loading, and it's not working in IE of course. Is there a reliable way to replace or rewrite a .load() call?
[13:22:37] <mattfieldy> peterschmidler: just do $('div.text').length
[13:22:47] <nFFF>  var content = $( data ).find( '#sid' ); <---- this will return an object?
[13:22:55] <nFFF> And your trying to pass this as the url string
[13:23:05] <BillCriswell> JBP641: I was mistaking.
[13:23:36] <JBP641> no that's just returning a <div> that contains something like this CA788cea66f55e419396a10546340c8b02
[13:24:01] <JBP641> and then I want to use what's returned to load the call/status
[13:24:45] <antipattern> JBP641: he's saying when you add "content" to the url, you dont get the string you expect
[13:25:03] <JBP641> ah
[13:25:11] <nFFF> Its not a string its an object...
[13:25:15] <JBP641> what's it actually printing?
[13:25:19] <mattfieldy> JBP, don't you need to specify what in your <div> you want to use? At the moment it's just finding the <div> and that's it.
[13:25:22] <antipattern> depends on the browser
[13:25:39] <JBP641> hmm there's only one thing in that div
[13:25:40] <dorgan> how would i query for an input with a specific value?
[13:25:45] <antipattern> but probably something like [Object object], you want to use content.text()
[13:25:50] <JBP641> and it's that CA788cea66f55e419396a10546340c8b02
[13:25:52] <nFFF> var content = $( data ).find( '#sid' ).text();
[13:26:02] <mattfieldy> In just plain text?
[13:26:10] <JBP641> yea
[13:26:19] <nFFF> Your passing an object as a url string to an AJAX request, you can not do this
[13:26:57] <JBP641> gotcha
[13:27:00] <JBP641> yea that makes since now
[13:27:03] <JBP641> it's working
[13:27:08] <peterschmidler> Why does this not work? for (var i = 1; i <= $('div.item').length; i++ ) { $( ".item" ).eq(i).hide( ) ; } ;
[13:27:09] <antipattern> dorgan: $(":text").filter(function() { this.value == 'what im looking for' })
[13:27:09] <JBP641> on to the next problem lol
[13:27:12] <antipattern> err
[13:27:22] <antipattern> * return this.value ...
[13:27:40] <dorgan> i thought there way a way of doing it with $(input[value=foo])   ??
[13:27:48] <dorgan> antipattern: is that not possible
[13:28:10] <ch3mical> Does anyone know if there's a way to create a deferred function without executing it immediately?
[13:28:26] <mattfieldy> you got it sorted JBP?
[13:28:27] <antipattern> dorgan: i thought that only worked if it was teh original value? not sure. did you try it?
[13:28:39] <dorgan> in my case it would be the original value :)
[13:28:57] <JBP641> matty I think so…this might sound dumb.  Can I use that content variable on other parts of the page now?
[13:29:00] <dorgan> so i guess that works...sorry i just happen to come across it after i asked the question
[13:29:02] <nFFF> ?demo @ peterschmidler
[13:29:02] <JBP641> or is that only within that function
[13:29:02] <bot-t> peterschmidler, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:29:51] <mattfieldy> just within that function, I should think. local var.
[13:30:03] <JBP641> hmm
[13:31:17] <JBP641> Mattfieldy…basically what I need to do is monitor that status response every few seconds and then print a status…but if it =done at anytime do something else
[13:31:24] <JBP641> I guess I could do that all within my function
[13:32:26] <davistv> Anyone have advice on a  good way to monitor image loading in IE?  .load() is not firing.
[13:32:37] <Trisox> how do i pass this in here ? http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/nrThR/
[13:32:54] <mattfieldy> JBP, what have you got loading that would take longing than a few seconds?
[13:33:42] <JBP641> mattyfieldy: It's monitoring the status of a phone call
[13:33:48] <gho5t> Anyone familiar with the jquery tooltip from Bassassistance, do you know why $("#tootlip").tooltip("show") won't actually call the show method?
[13:33:49] <nFFF> Trisox, this in where?
[13:33:51] <nFFF> :>
[13:34:01] <JBP641> Matty, and there's a rest service that gives me the status of said phone call
[13:34:04] <Trisox> the click
[13:34:21] <nFFF> Your code is horrible :<
[13:34:31] <nFFF> and live is depracted :|
[13:35:03] <JBP641> and when the call status is complete we take the user to another page.
[13:35:03] <mattfieldy> JBP, ok, I'm with you
[13:35:28] <Trisox> nFFF: sure on then
[13:35:31] <Trisox> ...
[13:35:50] <JBP641> may I pm?
[13:36:02] <mattfieldy> sure thing, JBP
[13:36:11] <nFFF> Trisox, whats the issue?
[13:36:43] <nFFF> Cant you rewrite your code into one function?
[13:36:47] <nFFF> They all seem redundant
[13:37:22] <nFFF> It's the craziest code Ive seen in a while:|||||||||
[13:37:24] <Trisox> not there 3 li lists
[13:37:30] <Trisox> its not crazy.,.,,
[13:37:52] <Trisox> you know passing vars in functions around right?
[13:38:17] <nFFF> Oh ok sorry I glanced and thought you had 3 identical functions :>>
[13:38:35] <Trisox> haha no ;)
[13:38:40] <Trisox> its optimized
[13:38:56] <Trisox> is it less crazy now?
[13:39:10] <nFFF> Ok so your issue is where
[13:39:16] <nFFF> Can you upload a little html
[13:40:02] <nFFF> input[type=radio]
[13:40:33] <shwaiil> hi
[13:40:50] <shwaiil> Q: If $(el) ins a <input type="checkbox"> how to see if it's checked ? Thanks
[13:41:47] <Eviltwin> .is(":checked")
[13:41:58] <shwaiil> Eviltwin: thanks a lot :D
[13:42:59] <nFFF> Eviltwin $('[type=radio]') isn't a valid selector right?
[13:43:43] <Eviltwin> It's a valid selector
[13:43:52] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/nrThR/
[13:43:54] <Eviltwin> It's better to have a quoted value
[13:43:55] <Trisox> nFFF:
[13:44:01] <Eviltwin> And it's ideal to filter by an element first
[13:44:03] <Es0teric|AFK> nFFF, what you gave me before still works the same… the code from this morning
[13:44:12] <Eviltwin> Because in that form it means *[type="radio"]
[13:44:18] <Es0teric|AFK> its still defining the placeholder as "undefined" on the hoverout
[13:44:19] <Eviltwin> Effectively selecting every element in the DOm
[13:44:21] <Eviltwin> DOM*
[13:44:29] <Eviltwin> And then checking for the ones that have type="radio"
[13:44:36] <nFFF> Es0teric|AFK, show me the fiddle again
[13:44:37] <Trisox> nFFF: it works here
[13:44:40] <Trisox> ....
[13:44:44] <Trisox> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/nrThR/
[13:44:49] <nFFF> Trisox, ok and whats the issue?
[13:44:56] <Trisox> none prob something else
[13:45:00] <Trisox> when isolated it works
[13:45:00] <Es0teric|AFK> nFFF -> http://jsfiddle.net/EUcPa/4/
[13:45:06] <Trisox> weird :D
[13:45:13] <nFFF> :D
[13:45:22] <peterschmidler> What's the best practice to write a query command to an a-href-tag?
[13:45:32] <Trisox> nFFF: any ideas how to opitmize
[13:45:43] <nFFF> Es0teric|AFK, it does what? it works fine for me
[13:45:46] <Trisox> like self executing/infocking function or something
[13:46:24] <Es0teric|AFK> nFFF, on hoverout the $(this).data('foo'); becomes undefined
[13:46:43] <Es0teric|AFK> OH NO wait wait
[13:46:44] <Es0teric|AFK> give me a minute
[13:46:45] <batousai> is it possible to handle http-equiv="refresh" as a 302 redirect?
[13:46:49] <nFFF> Trisox, Im not sure I follow, your on function works fine so whats the issue?
[13:46:55] <nFFF> You can condense all your functions though
[13:47:04] <Trisox> how?
[13:47:27] <Trisox> each loop?
[13:48:03] <dorgan> i am assuming I am doing this wrong, is there a way to do it?  $('input[name="pro_txt[]"][value="Colors"]')
[13:48:08] <Eviltwin> batousai: Not directly, no
[13:48:25] <Eviltwin> dorgan: Read the top of this page: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[13:48:40] <peterschmidler> How can I get the amount of href tags on one page?
[13:48:58] <Es0teric|AFK> nFFF, THIS is what happens -> http://jsfiddle.net/EUcPa/5/
[13:49:05] <Eviltwin> peterschmidler: There's no such thing as an href tag
[13:49:09] <Es0teric|AFK> because i bind it to ('.assignment_type')
[13:49:16] <Es0teric|AFK> on mouseout
[13:49:37] <peterschmidler> Eviltwin: <a href="…">…</a>
[13:49:53] <dorgan> Eviltwin: ok i am escaping now but it seems to be giving back all inputs with that name AND the input with that value
[13:49:59] <dorgan> $('input[name="pro_txt\\[\\]"][value="Colors"]')
[13:50:09] <nFFF> Trisox
[13:50:14] <nFFF> isn't this the same: http://jsfiddle.net/nrThR/4/
[13:50:40] <nFFF> Es0teric|AFK
[13:50:51] <Trisox> nFFF: nice did know you could do that :D
[13:50:54] <nFFF> you have issues with scope
[13:51:04] <Es0teric|AFK> nFFF, yeah i know...
[13:51:07] <Trisox> nice idea that
[13:51:18] <nFFF> Es0teric|AFK ill fix it
[13:51:18] <nFFF> sec
[13:51:21] <peterschmidler> How will I get the amount of links aon a page?
[13:51:21] <Es0teric|AFK> i have to get used to the scope in js… i am too used to the scope in PHP
[13:51:59] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/EUcPa/6/
[13:52:07] <nFFF> See what I did
[13:52:21] <nFFF> You need to be aware of what 'this' is referring to within functions
[13:52:34] <Eviltwin> dorgan: You mean either or or the ones that match both?
[13:52:39] <gho5t> Anyone familiar with the jquery tooltip from Bassassistance, do you know why $("#tootlip").tooltip("show") won't actually call the show method?
[13:52:49] <dorgan> Eviltwin: I need it to match both
[13:53:03] <Eviltwin> dorgan: Do you mean intersection or union
[13:53:43] <dorgan> no sure what you mean.... I need to check for a value of colors, existing on any input with the name of pro_txt[]
[13:53:45] <Es0teric|AFK> nFFF, yes but when i continously hover over the item, it eventually changes to what it is on hover in… it doesnt change back and fourth consistently
[13:54:01] <aghouseh> do i have to do anything different other than .clone(true,true) to maintain deep data/event binding?
[13:54:15] <nFFF> Es0teric|AFK, no idea what you mean?
[13:54:36] <nFFF> You mean if you keep moving over it
[13:54:41] <Es0teric|AFK> nFFF, just hover in and out on the item continuously… you'll see what i mean
[13:54:42] <nFFF> It eventually stops changing?
[13:54:47] <Es0teric|AFK> yeah nFFF
[13:55:23] <nFFF> becuase look at where you are binding the hover to
[13:56:26] <Es0teric|AFK> nFFF, but i need to bind it there...
[13:56:34] <nFFF> Oh wait
[13:56:44] <peterschmidler> How can I get the amount of links in the first div with the class item? http://jsfiddle.net/peterschmidler/24kMG/
[13:57:01] <Eviltwin> dorgan: http://jsfiddle.net/3jZMr/
[13:57:03] <nFFF> Thats wierd
[13:57:08] <nFFF> Eviltwin :<
[13:57:28] <Trisox> nFFF:  in my app             listSelector.not(this).removeClass('selectedItem'); doesnt work
[13:57:35] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/EUcPa/6/ why does this after x amount of calls to hover() stop working
[13:57:41] <Eviltwin> nFFF: What is liseSelector in that case?
[13:57:47] <Eviltwin> listSelector*
[13:57:53] <dabear> peterschmidler: there are no links inside a div there
[13:58:11] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/nrThR/4/ <--
[13:58:33] <Eviltwin> dorgan: What were you trying to select
[13:58:35] <Trisox> does the way you scope it drill down in the function that far?
[13:58:36] <Eviltwin> Out of that table?
[13:59:33] <Es0teric|AFK> nFFF, i dont see the changes
[13:59:35] <Es0teric|AFK> o.O
[13:59:37] <Es0teric|AFK> its still the same
[13:59:43] <peterschmidler> dabear: Sorry, but still no success: http://jsfiddle.net/peterschmidler/24kMG/
[13:59:54] <nFFF> Es0teric|AFK, sec
[14:00:13] <dabear> peterschmidler: what do you want?
[14:00:23] <dabear> a value for each .item's anchor?
[14:00:25] <dabear> or a total?
[14:00:26] <Trisox> nFFF: the this doesnt work proper...
[14:00:39] <dabear> anchors*
[14:00:49] <peterschmidler> dabear: I want the amount of links inside the first <div class="item">…</div>
[14:01:28] <nFFF> Trisox, how?
[14:01:37] <nFFF> try $(this)
[14:01:43] <Trisox> dont know the             listSelector.not(this).removeClass('selectedItem'); doesnt go off
[14:01:46] <dabear> peterschmidler: alert($(".item").first().find("a").length)​​
[14:01:48] <dorgan> Eviltwin: the first one
[14:02:50] <nFFF> Es0teric|AFK, I think we can attack this differently
[14:03:35] <Es0teric|AFK> nFFF attack it how?
[14:03:43] <nFFF> When your mouse leaves: '.assignmt_img', you want to then bind mouseleave to '.assignment_type'
[14:03:54] <Es0teric|AFK> geez
[14:03:57] <nFFF> When your mouse leaves: '.assignmt_img', you want to then bind mouseleave to '.assignment_type'
[14:03:59] <nFFF> ?
[14:04:20] <Es0teric|AFK> yes
[14:04:25] <nFFF> OR do you jus want to bind mouseleave to '.assignment_type' regardless of .assignmt_img
[14:05:00] <Es0teric|AFK> nFFF no, it needs to mouseover .assignmt_img to mouseout on .assignment_type
[14:05:08] <nFFF> Ok
[14:05:10] <nFFF> Thought so
[14:05:11] <jerwilkins> hey all, having a tricky bug where my generated image element remains style="display:none;" where it should become display:block. see jsfiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/Kah5w/
[14:05:18] <nFFF> We can change this code
[14:05:31] <jerwilkins> i've tried the .show() and .hide() methods as well; same trouble.
[14:06:14] <jerwilkins> (i realize enumerating the properties like this is not beautiful; i'll refactor once i have it working properly ;)
[14:06:18] <dabear> jerwilkins: pebkac?
[14:06:26] <dabear> jQuery(this)
[14:06:30] <dabear> this is the document
[14:06:58] <dabear> hm
[14:06:59] <dabear> no
[14:07:00] <dabear> sorry
[14:07:02] <jerwilkins> dabear: pebkac?
[14:07:33] <jerwilkins> dabear: yeah, i believe it should be scoped to disabledGoOnButton at that point.
[14:08:43] <jerwilkins> dabear: it places the image and its attributes exactly where it should go.
[14:09:06] <dabear> jerwilkins: that's a bad paste. no way to see the behavior
[14:09:27] <jerwilkins> dabear: should i throw in the pertinent xhtml as well?
[14:09:35] <Trisox> nFFF: $(this) doesnt work here
[14:09:48] <dabear> you should always make sure that the paste shows yout error
[14:10:10] <dabear> oh, jerwilkins see ?reduce
[14:10:10] <bot-t> oh, Try reducing your code to the simplest example that still breaks, and *then* show it to us. Often you'll discover the answer in the process.
[14:11:00] <jerwilkins> dabear: acknowledged. checking it out.
[14:11:42] <peterschmidler> How can I address the first link in the first div? jsfiddle.net/peterschmidler/24kMG/
[14:12:17] <nFFF> Trisox, you use not(this), try not($(this))
[14:12:29] <nFFF> Es0teric|AFK, I think the issue is recursiveness
[14:12:40] <mattfieldy> peter, you mean how can you target it?
[14:12:52] <Trisox> listSelector.not($(this)).removeClass('selectedItem'); ?
[14:12:57] <dabear> peterschmidler: $(".item").first().find("a").first()​​
[14:13:00] <peterschmidler> mattfieldy: Yes that might be the right way to say it ;)
[14:13:13] <nFFF> Trisox yea
[14:13:14] <mattfieldy> :)
[14:13:16] <dabear> or $(".item:first a:first")
[14:13:29] <Trisox> nope doesnt remove the class
[14:13:41] <peterschmidler> dabear: What, if I want to address the second link in the second div?
[14:13:55] <mattfieldy> yeah or $(".item:first a:first-of-type")
[14:14:17] <dabear> peterschmidler: :eq or .eq, but why do you need this granularity?
[14:14:20] <Es0teric|AFK> nFFF, yeah
[14:14:55] <peterschmidler> THANK YOU ALL!
[14:15:10] <mattfieldy> *salutes*
[14:15:55] <nFFF> Trisox
[14:16:11] <nFFF> listSelector.not(this).removeClass('selectedItem'); <------ think about this
[14:16:19] <nFFF> listSelector.not($(this)).removeClass('selectedItem'); <------ think about this
[14:16:28] <nFFF> What does $(this) return?
[14:16:30] <Trisox> mmmm
[14:16:34] <nFFF> or what is it equal to
[14:16:41] <pflock> is there a command to add something at the end or beginning of a div?
[14:16:51] <pflock> so that it doesn't overwrite whats already there?
[14:16:53] <dabear> pflock: see ?prepend
[14:16:53] <bot-t> pflock, .prepend(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[14:16:55] <dabear> and append
[14:16:57] <nFFF> what is passed to your function?
[14:17:08] <Es0teric|AFK> nFFF, so how would i actually tackle the recursiveness?
[14:17:21] <pflock> I am using append but that doesn't work somehow
[14:17:30] <Trisox> $(this) returns the selected li
[14:17:35] <dabear> ?paste @ pflock
[14:17:36] <bot-t> pflock, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:17:41] <dabear> ?reduce @ pflock
[14:17:42] <bot-t> pflock, Try reducing your code to the simplest example that still breaks, and *then* show it to us. Often you'll discover the answer in the process.
[14:17:56] <Trisox> nFFF: i tried your examples
[14:18:16] <atpa8a> hmm
[14:18:58] <atpa8a> a block of my code is executed *before* previous block... what's the matter with that?
[14:19:19] <nFFF> Trisox
[14:19:21] <nFFF> Exactly
[14:19:40] <nFFF> listSelector returns what?
[14:19:42] <dabear> atpa8a: no idea, probably you're using .ajax or a set timeout
[14:19:48] <nFFF> and $(this) returns what?
[14:19:55] <nFFF> do you see where Im going?
[14:20:01] <peterschmidler> Can i make a click function inside a for loop?
[14:20:03] <nFFF> Es0teric|AFK, http://jsfiddle.net/EUcPa/7/ ask Eviltwin
[14:20:07] <Trisox> the thing is when i pass it in firebug the code
[14:20:08] <Trisox> it works
[14:20:08] <atpa8a> dabear: ajax it is, any remedy?
[14:20:09] <nFFF> theres something going on hurre
[14:20:10] <Trisox> ...
[14:20:14] <Trisox> thats whats weird
[14:20:20] <nFFF> tripodman
[14:20:28] <atpa8a> i use getJSON
[14:20:31] <dabear> atpa8a: ajax is async. add your code to the success callback of the ajax request
[14:20:41] <pflock> http://jsfiddle.net/eHgrR/ So I deleted all code that hasn't anything to do with the problem. The code shoud give me a new circle every time but it always deletes the old one
[14:20:44] <tw2113> mmjson
[14:20:49] <nFFF> Trisox, these are equiv.  listSelector.not($(this)).removeClass('selectedItem'); and  $(this).not($(this)).removeClass('selectedItem');
[14:20:50] <atpa8a> hmm
[14:20:55] <tripodman> nFFF: sup mang?
[14:21:01] <nFFF> tripodman wrong person :D
[14:21:01] <Trisox> nFFF: i know there the same
[14:21:09] <atpa8a> dabear: thanks... looking
[14:22:14] <dorgan> ok so $('table#review_form_table tr:odd').addClass('rowOdd');  seems to work ok except for the fact that it seems to be counting nested table rows
[14:22:33] <dorgan> so if i have another table inside of a given cell its counting those rows
[14:23:15] <pflock> dabear: here I pasted it here: http://jsfiddle.net/eHgrR/
[14:23:47] <Es0teric|AFK> nFFF what?
[14:24:15] <jaequery> is there something like, $('#bla').on('show', '#blabla', function(){ .... ?
[14:24:24] <dabear> pflock: avoid chaining
[14:24:40] <nFFF> Trisox, wait sorry whats the issue
[14:24:41] <pflock> dabear: what is chaining?
[14:24:55] <Trisox> the removeClass doesnt work
[14:24:59] <dabear> pflock: .foo().bar().baz().children()
[14:25:25] <pflock> dabear: ah okay
[14:25:34] <dabear> avoid massive chaining*
[14:25:44] <nFFF> Trisox, it does for me?
[14:25:44] <Trisox> listSelector doesnt get passed
[14:25:45] <dabear> ie. test each step
[14:25:51] <EyePulp> anyone know a good channel for backbone.js discussion?  my dumbness is growing worse by the minute. =)
[14:26:08] <jaequery> #backbone
[14:26:09] <Trisox> its returns jQuery()
[14:26:15] <Trisox> if i console.log it
[14:26:30] <nFFF> You want the remove the class whenever they click another inut?
[14:26:46] <EyePulp> jaequery: #documentcloud
[14:27:05] <EyePulp> repointed from #backbone though, so thanks.
[14:27:10] <Trisox> i want the li that is selected to have the class and the rest not..

[14:29:46] <JonathanCutrell> Hey folks.
[14:29:48] <JonathanCutrell> Got a question.
[14:29:53] <Trisox> let me try
[14:30:11] <JonathanCutrell> I'm trying to do an auto scrolling action whenever someone scrolls to a halfway point (or not) of some slides.
[14:30:20] <JonathanCutrell> So, you have point 1 and point 2,
[14:30:40] <JonathanCutrell> and when they scroll to halfway between point 1 and 2, I'm trying to animate scroll position to point 2.
[14:30:43] <JonathanCutrell> Seems simple enough.
[14:30:55] <JonathanCutrell> so I'm watching the window for scroll,
[14:31:10] <Trisox> nFFF: that deslects other lists
[14:31:15] <Es0teric|AFK> nFFF
[14:31:20] <JonathanCutrell> and then clearing and re-setting a timeout to scroll to that point.
[14:31:35] <JonathanCutrell> so here is the code: http://jsbin.com/izasoz/3
[14:31:48] <JonathanCutrell> for some reason, every time I scroll over halfway, it scrolls all the way to the last item.
[14:33:12] <peterschmidler> I created click functions in a for loop but unfortunately i cannot use the i in the click function since it's always the highest value when I click the links… http://jsfiddle.net/peterschmidler/azkgM/
[14:34:07] <nFFF> Trisox
[14:34:08] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/nrThR/6/
[14:35:23] <peterschmidler> How can I "freeze" the var i when I create click functions in a loop? http://jsfiddle.net/peterschmidler/azkgM/
[14:35:48] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/nrThR/7/
[14:36:00] <Trisox> oh :P
[14:36:08] <Trisox> same idea lol
[14:36:33] <nFFF> Yea understand where Ive been going for last 10 minutes
[14:36:35] <Trisox> haha nice
[14:36:50] <nFFF> youve been doing  $(this).not($(this)).removeClass('selectedItem');
[14:36:56] <nFFF> That doesnt make sense
[14:36:58] <Trisox> yea i know this is hard
[14:37:07] <nFFF> Is it :<
[14:37:47] <Trisox> ist 23:37 here and i was up @8:00 and at work @9:30
[14:38:02] <Trisox> so long day gets you to lose focus some time
[14:38:30] <Trisox> nFFF: thanx for learning me the object passing thing in an function like that
[14:38:37] <Trisox> did know you could do that
[14:38:59] <Trisox> can you also chain it?
[14:39:51] <nFFF> chain it?
[14:40:02] <nFFF> Im in Europe too :|
[14:40:31] <Trisox> aii
[14:41:00] <Trisox> yea soemthing like selectedItem($('#lol'),$('#lol'));
[14:41:00] <Agamemnus> jquery is the devil, and I intend to purge THEE
[14:41:09] * Agamemnus runs
[14:41:14] <crutex> does anyone have some good examples (non minimized / obfuscated) of medium - large scale heavy js web apps
[14:41:20] <crutex> i'm trying to improve my architecture
[14:41:46] <Trisox> i think deviantart didn minimize there stuff
[14:42:02] <nFFF> Trisox, sure
[14:42:10] <nFFF> this jsut reutnrs an object
[14:42:32] <nFFF> I dont see why youd ever do that though
[14:42:41] <Trisox> or they do now
[14:42:51] <Trisox> passing more then 1 variable
[14:43:10] <nFFF> but your passing the same object twice...
[14:43:18] <nFFF> you can pass as many arguments as you want
[14:43:23] <nFFF> but identical arguments???? :|
[14:43:32] <Trisox> yea soemthing like selectedItem($('#lol'),$('#cat));
[14:43:35] <Trisox> like that
[14:43:43] <Trisox> yea i know lol i was lazy :P
[14:43:44] <Trisox> sttt
[14:44:06] <Trisox> but oke cool stuff
[14:44:28] <pflock> Why doesn't this script ( http://jsfiddle.net/eHgrR/2/ ) append new div's to the document but overwrites everything even though I use .append() ?
[14:44:54] <nFFF> oh ok yea thats fine
[14:45:19] <nFFF> but youd never use 'this' for a function that accepts two objects
[14:45:23] <nFFF> I wonder what this would return
[14:45:29] <nFFF> perhaps an array of the objects
[14:47:15] <Trisox> nFFF: true mmm
[14:48:26] <muzone> hello! how'd you guys wget all of http://www.awesometapes.com/ and http://moroccantapestash.blogspot.com/ into an organized collection? wget -mk -w 3 http://awesometapes.com oughta work right? but no!
[14:48:35] <Trisox> pflock: you update the cordinates
[14:48:39] <Trisox> so they overlap
[14:48:56] <Trisox> children targets all the childeren ;)
[14:49:27] <nFFF> Trisox, if you pass more than one object
[14:49:31] <nFFF> this becomes domwindow
[14:49:39] <pflock> Trisox: And how can I only target the div I last appended?
[14:51:07] <sphinxxx> pflock: http://jsfiddle.net/eHgrR/6/
[14:51:12] <kamoricks> So I have http://jsfiddle.net/Acfwy/1/ . Why don't I get the alert()? Accessing the URL directly gives me the page just fine.
[14:51:47] <sphinxxx> i would hate to see the DOM after clicking on that page for a while, lol
[14:51:54] <Trisox> sphinxxx: you where just bit faster
[14:52:00] <Trisox> i used .last()
[14:52:10] <Trisox> hehe :D
[14:52:10] <coldhead> heya Trisox
[14:52:14] <Trisox> hey coldhead
[14:52:14] <coldhead> nice to see you
[14:52:17] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me with a purcase.. im unsure of who to pick.. and im pretty sure i cant get in contact with the developer fast.. this: http://codecanyon.net/item/royalslider-touchenabled-jquery-image-gallery/461126 or this: http://codecanyon.net/item/touchcarousel-jquery-content-scroller-and-slider/896401
[14:52:20] <sphinxxx> .last  + caching the circle class is probably faster
[14:52:21] <Trisox> yea its nice how your doing
[14:52:34] <coldhead> thank goddess it's friday!
[14:52:35] <pflock> sphinxxx: Thanks!!! Works perfect
[14:52:36] <Trisox> yup make a var of  it
[14:52:39] <coldhead> that's how i'm doing
[14:52:39] <Trisox> friday indeed
[14:52:50] <Trisox> 8 more hours of work to go
[14:52:53] <xckpd7> how would you access variables inside of a console if you're working on a jsfiddle?
[14:52:58] <xckpd7> question: ^
[14:53:41] <Trisox> xckpd7: you can do  http://jsfiddle.net/eHgrR/6/show
[14:53:47] <Trisox> for example to show only your code
[14:54:11] <Trisox> i my self like to work in cloud9 if i work online
[14:54:19] <Trisox> and dont have to share the fiddle
[14:54:25] <Trisox> jsfiddle is slow sometime
[14:54:40] <sphinxxx> although Trisox   i think last-chid may be faster b/c its a native css selector
[14:55:03] <Trisox> mmm
[14:55:21] <Trisox> might be no idea ;)
[14:55:27] <Trisox> depends on the clicks hehe
[14:56:26] <kanja> Does the ajax method provide an easy way to specify the outgoing mimetype?
[14:56:33] <atpa8a> hmm
[14:56:42] <kamoricks> kanja: Yes, "data".
[14:56:53] <kamoricks> kanja: Mimetype. SOrry, read that as "message".
[14:57:05] <atpa8a> syntactically... http://jsfiddle.net/M7JEG/1/ ...is this correct?
[14:57:19] <kamoricks> kanja: mimeType, since there seems to be a separate "type" for responses.
[14:57:23] <atpa8a> can i use ajaxComplete() this way?
[14:58:15] <kanja> kamoricks: what's the difference between mimeType and contentType?
[14:58:53] <kamoricks> kanja: Not sure.
[14:59:33] <kanja> kamoricks: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3452381/whats-the-difference-of-contenttype-and-mimetype I guess?
[14:59:39] <kanja> weird
[15:00:29] <kanja> kamoricks: looks like I want to use contentType in this case. Thanks for the help!
[15:01:54] <kamoricks> Why would document.getElementById("foo").value = 5; work, but $("#foo").value = 5; not?
[15:02:13] <xckpd7> Trisox++
[15:02:35] <Vaerros> kamoricks: use .val('5'), or .attr('value', 5)
[15:02:46] <Trisox> ?
[15:02:56] <kamoricks> Vaerros: Ah. Thanks.
[15:05:00] <Trisox> nFFF: have a nice evening i'm off to bed soon
[15:05:08] <Trisox> coldhead: your gone again?
[15:14:20] <ProLoser|Work> unicode characters to specify template variables, yay or nay?
[15:17:08] <revil> hi guys!! I have a list of items with many properties, some of them are expandable. Which widget would you consider using? Consider Students which have name, MN, mail, but are also equipped with lists of books and lists of subjects, which I'd like to be expandable at will

[15:25:37] <atpa8a> hmm
[15:25:50] <atpa8a> does span have display=none?..

[15:30:21] <nFFF> atpa8a if a tree falls in a forest and no one is there, does it make a sound???

[15:31:33] <dabear> so it makes a sound

[15:53:06] <peterschmidler> Or is there a better way to do this?
[15:53:14] <shinobi> you mean to get the href?
[15:53:40] <peterschmidler> shinobi: To name the links in order to target them with query.
[15:53:51] <shinobi> id="someid"
[15:54:16] <peterschmidler> shinobi: bit ids may only appear once on a page ?
[15:54:56] <peterschmidler> shinobi: I use class="55" several times on the page.
[15:55:07] <shinobi> peterschmidler: then select on the class
[15:55:33] <shinobi> peterschmidler: $('.55').doSomething()
[15:55:33] <peterschmidler> shinobi: How do I get the number with query?
[15:55:51] <shinobi> peterschmidler: use . for classes and # for ids
[15:56:07] <shinobi> peterschmidler: just like in your HTML
[15:56:22] <shinobi> peterschmidler: er nevermind that I'm too used to HAML now
[15:56:30] <shinobi> $('.55') should get them

[18:23:14] <Consolas> hey guys
[18:23:46] <Consolas> I have a each() going, and want to use inside something like $(this li).atrr() et etc
[18:23:50] <Consolas> hos is this accomplished?
[18:24:00] <Consolas> $(this[li]) ?
[18:24:29] <donCams> somebody asked this on ##javascript. i'm also interested in his question. what's wrong with this code? http://jsfiddle.net/bdXPd/2/
[18:24:58] <StevenCodes22> $(this).find("li");
[18:25:45] <Consolas> and if I have several li? $(this).find("li").each ... ?
[18:25:57] <donCams> Consolas: yes
[18:26:10] <Consolas> thank you.
[18:26:25] <donCams> $(this).find('li').each(function() { var $this = $(this); });
[18:26:33] <Consolas> last question: if I have an id, its the same thing but with # right?
[18:26:54] <Consolas> I think once I did something like this name['stuff']
[18:26:56] <donCams> Consolas: yes, $('#myElementId')
[18:27:03] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: you around?
[18:27:09] <donCams> Consolas: if you have name="stuff"
[18:27:12] <scorphus> poor jquery, it rocks as splendid, gifted garage guitarist, but GWT stands as a conductor of an philharmonic orchestra compared to it
[18:28:05] <donCams> scorphus: it's ok. i'm not into classical music much
[18:28:14] <Consolas> ok, it acted like a shortcut
[18:28:18] <Consolas> for the find
[18:28:21] <tw2113> evening donCams
[18:28:22] <Consolas> ok thank you very much donCams
[18:28:29] <donCams> evening tw2113
[18:28:34] <scorphus> donCams: exactly! jquery fits much of my needs pretty well too =)
[18:30:18] <donCams> although, i would like to see a full-blown orchestra playing pirates of the caribbean theme.
[18:30:53] <coldhead> donCams: js has function level scoping, so testing() is only visible within the init function
[18:31:04] <coldhead> it can't be accessed from outside
[18:31:08] <coldhead> it's "private"
[18:31:12] <donCams> yes coldhead. how do I access it from the other function?
[18:31:17] <donCams> oh... so it's not possible?
[18:31:30] <coldhead> you need to declare it outside the init() function
[18:31:33] <someprimetime> coldhead: interesting
[18:31:36] <donCams> cool. thanks :)
[18:31:36] <coldhead> and it will be visible outside that function
[18:31:38] <someprimetime> kind of figured that though
[18:31:53] <coldhead> you're sharp as a whip someprimetime :)
[18:32:00] <someprimetime> psh haha
[18:32:06] <someprimetime> not that sharp ;)
[18:32:12] <someprimetime> just curious
[18:32:17] <donCams> yeah... i just thought it would be possible to access that. hehe. someprimetime asked it on ##javascript :3
[18:32:28] <donCams> just making sure :) thanks coldhead
[18:32:42] <coldhead> no worries!

[18:48:25] <andornaut> How can I get the the html of an element as a string? Say, I've selected an input, how would i output it? (I'm actually trying to use it in a jsrender template)?
[18:48:40] <andornaut> (ugh, that's really not clear)
[18:49:28] <andornaut> <input id="foo">   var foo = $('#foo'); var foo_html_as_string = ?
[18:49:50] <andornaut> where foo_html_as_string = '<input id="foo">'
[18:53:57] <dilvie> andornaut: https://github.com/dilvie/jQuery.outerHTML/blob/master/jquery.outerhtml.js
[18:56:25] <someprimetime> how come the first works, but the second doesn't? http://jsfiddle.net/ACwxG/
[18:57:40] <donCams> someprimetime: right-side panel. choose jQuery
[18:58:04] <someprimetime> donCams: err woops, but even then it still won't work :\
[18:58:08] <donCams> someprimetime: use .on()
[18:58:27] <someprimetime> just was starting to use some of the drag drop html5 stuff and this is from the example
[18:58:40] <someprimetime> unfortunately we're still stuck on jquery < 1.7
[18:58:48] <andornaut> dilvie: that works, thanks!
[18:58:49] <someprimetime> so i'd have to use delegate
[18:59:03] <donCams> $dropZone.bind, .delegate, .live
[18:59:32] <someprimetime> live() *shudders*
[18:59:48] <donCams> addEventListener won't work on IE right?
[18:59:57] <donCams> let me review my js. hahaha
[19:00:51] <someprimetime> hah IE is left in the dark with this one unfortunately
[19:01:08] <someprimetime> i'm building a photo uploader and we've decided that we get better photos from people uploading on newer browsers
[19:01:12] <someprimetime> so we're just dropping IE support for it
[19:01:41] <donCams> sounds logical
[19:02:20] <someprimetime> the worst thing about the FileList object in html5 which i've already been expressing disinterest in, is that it's a readonly object, so if a user wants to remove a file from their selection queue, they can't. i've been forced to clone the object and maintain that
[19:02:27] <donCams> right. IE8 and below attachEvent :3
[19:02:29] <someprimetime> it's just annoying
[19:03:40] <donCams> someprimetime: http://www.plupload.com/ seems decent
[19:05:49] <dilvie> .on()
[19:05:51] <dilvie> =)

[19:17:33] <ChrisCarter> <li href="yourlink">
[19:20:24] <LekeFly> ChrisCarter: As far as i know you cant link like that.. has to be anchor
[19:20:32] <ChrisCarter> ah
[19:20:56] <LekeFly> Or can you bind jQuery to li href? i dunno :p
[19:21:43] <ChrisCarter> it has to make sense in the dom
[19:21:51] <ChrisCarter> so i doubt it if you cant with just html / css
[19:21:54] <ChrisCarter> but you could try
[19:23:08] <LekeFly> ChrisCarter: i think i should just edit the cloud-zoom js but i dont know how:/

[20:16:24] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me with getting a clickable links (going to use it for a lightbox) on 1.jpg on this page: http://sandquist.no/dev/royalslider/image-gallery-demo.html
[20:21:24] <radiantstatic> I've got a two parter. Currently this: http://jsfiddle.net/nvvJN/ is fading from 1.0 opacity to 0. Is there a way I can reverse that? 0 opacity to full? And how would I go about looping this indefinitely?
[20:24:06] <nobitanobi> Why when I do this: http://friendpaste.com/27px4vKZP1rIEsyyOc9tsb -- The alert shows 348663192381816800 instead of 348663192381816834 ?
[20:26:27] <nobitanobi> Why when I do this: http://friendpaste.com/27px4vKZP1rIEsyyOc9tsb -- The alert shows 348663192381816800 instead of 348663192381816834 ?
[20:27:25] <TNA-MichaelK> nobitanobi: ummm, do you have any functions rewriting the contents of that tag, also (lol), did you save the file?
[20:28:12] <nobitanobi> TNA-MichaelK: I don't have any functions rewriting the content of the tag. What do you mean by save the file?
[20:28:40] <nobitanobi> TNA-MichaelK: Might it be an overflow of integer?, it's weird is just adding those two 00
[20:29:02] <TNA-MichaelK> Well, was it 6800 and then you changed the html to 6834?  How are you printing that <td> directly in html?  Or, is it script driven?
[20:30:24] <nobitanobi> It's script, but I even hardcoded it...
[20:30:34] <nobitanobi> if I put "cc" at the end
[20:30:37] <ajpiano> nobitanobi: data- is a little aggressive
[20:30:44] <ajpiano> about coercing numbers
[20:30:47] <ajpiano> there's a bunch of bugs about it
[20:30:52] <nobitanobi> mmm, what should I use then?
[20:30:59] <ajpiano> but unfortunately no workaround except for doing .attr("data-item_id")
[20:31:04] <ajpiano> if you want the untouched string
[20:31:20] <nobitanobi> mmm ok, let's see...
[20:31:32] <nobitanobi> what would be the benefeits of using data though?
[20:31:36] <nobitanobi> faster?
[20:32:03] <ajpiano> nobitanobi: it's convenient unless you have numbers that you don't want coerced
[20:32:07] <radiantstatic> Figured it out - what would be the best way to continuously loop this (ill obviously add fadeOut as well)? http://jsfiddle.net/nvvJN/1/
[20:32:21] <nobitanobi> ajpiano: when you say convenient, what do you mean?
[20:32:24] <ajpiano> .data() was jquery's internal way of associaing stuff with elements before there was the auto parsing of data- attributes
[20:32:29] <nobitanobi> oh ok
[20:32:33] <ajpiano> so you could always do $("#foo").data("bar", "baz')
[20:32:36] <nobitanobi> I see
[20:32:45] <nobitanobi> but it's ok to add an attribute called data-whatever
[20:32:51] <nobitanobi> from an HTML point of view
[20:32:54] <nobitanobi> right?
[20:34:26] <_eagspoo> In jquery-ui, using widget factory, is there a way to use widget factory where I create the dom node programatically in _create?  I'm using client side templates and I want the widget to handle it's own dom creation
[20:34:54] <Eviltwin> Not directly as far as I'm aware, you'd probably need to bridge to the widget factory to do that
[20:35:38] <radiantstatic> Anyone?
[20:35:46] <Eviltwin> Like $.myWidget = function(settings) { return $("<div>").myWidget(settings); };
[20:36:40] <_eagspoo> Eviltwin: well I'm doing $.widget('custom.myWidget', {...})
[20:36:41] <Eviltwin> radiantstatic: http://jsfiddle.net/nvvJN/2/
[20:36:53] <Eviltwin> _eagspoo: Yes and I'm saying that you'd still need a bridge for the creation
[20:37:02] <Eviltwin> The bridge I just wrote in fact
[20:37:14] <radiantstatic> Eviltwin: Thanks so much.
[20:37:20] <Eviltwin> That would allow you to do $("#mycontainer").append($.widget({...}))
[20:37:27] <Eviltwin> Err
[20:37:30] <Eviltwin> $.myWidget({...})
[20:37:34] <TNA-MichaelK> I'm having some serious problems with .getJSON and .post, I can only seem to get the object.  I'm using echo json_encode();  http://friendpaste.com/2SFtmKI4svWSnMPT8Mk40Y
[20:37:34] <nobitanobi> ajpiano: are those bugs known?
[20:37:42] <ajpiano> nobitanobi: very well, yes.
[20:37:43] <_eagspoo> Eviltwin: I dont understand.
[20:37:56] <Eviltwin> Then reread it and try it out and see what happens
[20:38:00] <nobitanobi> ok, I just wanted to know because if they weren't I would report
[20:38:01] <nobitanobi> thank you
[20:38:41] <_eagspoo> Eviltwin: I guess I'm not familiar with the term "bridge" in this context
[20:39:08] <Eviltwin> Bridging is the notion of taking data in one form and turning it into a form that something else can accept and work on
[20:39:26] <wookiehangover> Eviltwin: I think that's called "space-docking"
[20:39:32] <Eviltwin> In this case, taking the lack of an element (which widgets can't work on) and creating the necessary element structure (which the widget can work on)
[20:44:11] <_eagspoo> Eviltwin: so the $.myWidget you are proposing just wraps my jquery-ui widget and creates the necessary dom that I can then use in my custom.myWidget?   So I could do $.myWidget = function (settings) { return $(JST['myTemplate']()).myWidget(settings); }
[20:44:46] <Eviltwin> Whatever floats your metaphorical boat
[20:44:52] <_eagspoo> or $.myWidget = function (settings) { return new $custom.myWidget(settings, $(JST['myTemplate']()); }
[20:44:59] <radiantstatic> Eviltwin: I'm using http://jsfiddle.net/nvvJN/3/ - not getting any results… any idea?
[20:45:03] <Eviltwin> Do the first one
[20:45:06] <_eagspoo> Eviltwin: Ok, I"m just trying to understand the bridge you proposed above
[20:45:11] <Eviltwin> Probably because there's no code there
[20:45:16] <Eviltwin> No HTML or CSS etc
[20:45:24] <Eviltwin> So how the hell am I supposed to see if it's working
[20:45:39] <abjorn> coldhead: I vote jQuery's alias be changed from $ to 卐
[20:46:01] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me with getting a clickable links (going to use it for a lightbox) on 1.jpg on this page: http://sandquist.no/dev/royalslider/image-gallery-demo.html - Added some "helpful" code i found and added the lightbox im going to use.. would love if someone could take a peak and comment..
[20:46:22] <Eviltwin> abjorn: I think "1" would be a better choice
[20:46:23] <LekeFly> Also added a test link at the first slide with working lightbox
[20:46:33] <Eviltwin> Because it's the first library I turn to
[20:47:05] <abjorn> how about
[20:47:06] <abjorn> lambda!
[20:47:06] <abjorn> λ
[20:47:20] <Eviltwin> No, I think overloading integers is the right approach
[20:47:22] <nobitanobi> So, is it normal that when dinamically appending new content into the HTML using jquery, if I check the HTML source I just see the old content? Without the appended one?
[20:47:41] <Eviltwin> nobitanobi: Once the page source is downloaded
[20:47:45] <Eviltwin> The source will never, ever, ever, ever change
[20:47:50] <nobitanobi> I see
[20:47:52] <Eviltwin> No matter what you do in JavaScript
[20:47:55] <Eviltwin> With any library
[20:48:00] <Eviltwin> The DOM is what gets changed
[20:48:11] <nobitanobi> Ok...
[20:48:12] <Eviltwin> Which is a tree of Elements
[20:48:21] <Eviltwin> Not ASCII characters
[20:48:57] <abjorn> You're right, overloading integers is the correct approach.
[20:49:46] <nobitanobi> Eviltwin: If I'm adding dynamic content into a table, then I should be able to get the last row, even if it has been dynamically added right?
[20:49:53] <nobitanobi> that's a DOM element
[20:49:58] <Eviltwin> Yes
[20:50:00] <Eviltwin> If you do it right
[20:50:48] <nobitanobi> ok, I will start by trying to see how many <tr>s I have...
[20:51:07] <Eviltwin> Okay...
[20:52:36] <LekeFly> Should i redo it in jsfiddle instead? would someone take a look then? :p
[20:52:48] <Eviltwin> That's generally how people get people to read things here
[20:53:20] <Eviltwin> It helps if it also looks damn pretty too
[20:53:29] <Eviltwin> But with as little code as possible to reproduce
[20:53:30] <Eviltwin> ?jdb
[20:53:30] <bot-t> We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[20:53:35] <LekeFly> Eviltwin: True.. but the dev site i posted is really clean
[20:53:42] <LekeFly> Only the relevant code
[20:54:08] <Eviltwin> Yeah but that means I'd have to scroll up and I just don't feel like doing that
[20:54:10] <LekeFly> And i feel its to "big" for jsfiddle.. 5.js files and 3 css files :p
[20:54:12] <radiantstatic> Eviltwin: thevanderbuilts.com/splash/
[20:54:21] <Eviltwin> The goal is it should be small
[20:54:27] <nobitanobi> Eviltwin: the way Im doing it always things there is just one row.. So I'm doing something wrong
[20:54:37] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me with getting a clickable links (going to use it for a lightbox) on 1.jpg on this page: http://sandquist.no/dev/royalslider/image-gallery-demo.html - Added some "helpful" code i found and added the lightbox im going to use.. would love if someone could take a peak and comment..
[20:54:43] <Eviltwin> nobitanobi: Then, probably, yes
[20:54:52] <LekeFly> Eviltwin: Pasted it for you Eviltwin.. :p
[20:54:56] <LekeFly> Hehe
[20:56:40] <TNA-MichaelK> I can't seem to get results from my JSON object with data.id from getJSON.  I checked with #php and they said the php side is fine.
[20:58:09] <systematical> hello all
[20:58:12] <systematical> i was wondering if any of you have experience with jsonp?
[20:58:20] <nobitanobi> Can anyone tell me why the number of rows is not getting incremented even if I see more rows (visually) ? http://friendpaste.com/3kahzDkML2jhVK1ea92TPu
[20:58:46] <TNA-MichaelK> I can't seem to get results from my JSON object with data.id from getJSON.  I checked with #php and they said the php side is fine.
[20:58:58] <TNA-MichaelK> http://friendpaste.com/2SFtmKI4svWSnMPT8Mk40Y
[20:59:41] <systematical> nobitanobi: your example does not appear to be doing anything to increment the number of rows...
[20:59:58] <systematical> its just attempting to alert the length of that element
[21:00:19] <nobitanobi> systematical: I have this in another file that is rendered by the server side: $("#result_table").append("<%= escape_javascript(render("tables")) %>");
[21:00:31] <nobitanobi> and yes, the rows are incremented. I can see it.
[21:01:01] <systematical> yeah doesn't make sense to me
[21:01:08] <radiantstatic> Eviltwin: Any ideas why they aren't fading/looping?
[21:01:13] <TNA-MichaelK> looks like an asp problem to me
[21:01:19] <systematical> im really just in here trying to get help w/ jsonp though :p
[21:01:34] <TNA-MichaelK> systematical, me too
[21:01:42] <TNA-MichaelK> well, with json...
[21:13:01] <radiantstatic> Anyone know why my fadeIn/Out isn't working properly? - http://thevanderbuilts.com/splash/
[21:13:57] <TNA-MichaelK> *takes a look
[21:14:03] <TNA-MichaelK> point to the code?
[21:16:11] <radiantstatic> TNA-MichaelK: Would you prefer jsfiddle? For some reason it works in fiddles but not live...
[21:17:08] <TNA-MichaelK> sure
[21:18:08] <radiantstatic> http://jsfiddle.net/nvvJN/9/
[21:18:15] <radiantstatic> TNA-MichaelK: ^
[21:19:27] <TNA-MichaelK> oh, the images...
[21:20:37] <radiantstatic> TNA-MichaelK: yeah, any idea?
[21:21:14] <TNA-MichaelK> here's an alternate thing for you to do.... setInterval...
[21:21:20] <TNA-MichaelK> but, that'd be messier
[21:22:22] <radiantstatic> Any reason why its not displaying now?
[21:23:30] <TNA-MichaelK> radiantstatic: Here's an idea... make "tehLoop()" called onload instead
[21:23:55] <TNA-MichaelK> or in setInterval
[21:24:01] <TNA-MichaelK> those are my best ideas...
[21:27:06] <TNA-MichaelK> radiantstatic: http://jsfiddle.net/nvvJN/10/ ?
[21:28:02] <radiantstatic> TNA-MichaelK: Thanks, let me take a look.
[21:30:13] <EasyCo> Could somebody have a look at this please: http://jsfiddle.net/zrbje/
[21:31:33] <Cork> EasyCo: so you want to bind an event on a click?
[21:32:05] <Cork> as in, first clicking the div, the you can click the link?
[21:32:12] <EasyCo> Cork: No
[21:32:33] <EasyCo> Cork: I might be approaching this the wrong way, let me explain
[21:32:59] <aqeel> easyco....stop propagation on what
[21:33:28] <EasyCo> aqeel: disregard that, it's part of a bigger chunk of code
[21:33:32] <aqeel> tell us your flow of logic
[21:33:53] <aqeel> ok
[21:34:21] <EasyCo> So I've got this function that essentially positions and shows the div/box
[21:34:47] <aqeel> animate?
[21:34:58] <Cork> aqeel: let him explain
[21:35:06] <aqeel> sure.....carry on
[21:35:24] <EasyCo> When the box is displayed you can do one of two things, click YES and make a booking or click NO and close/hide the box
[21:35:52] <EasyCo> If you click YES, it hides the box and shows another box with it's own set of listeners
[21:37:49] <EasyCo> So both boxes share the same jquery code to display it BUT they have require different jquery code to cover their respective functionalities
[21:38:23] <Cork> EasyCo: and the different boxes has different dom elements?
[21:38:31] <Cork> as in they'r not reused?
[21:38:39] <EasyCo> Cork: Yes exactly
[21:38:58] <Cork> then what prevents you from just binding the events on the boxes?
[21:39:15] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/zrbje/1/
[21:40:23] <EasyCo> Here's a larger yet not the full code example: http://jsfiddle.net/zrbje/3/
[21:41:03] <EasyCo> Hang on
[21:41:10] <EasyCo> That's garbage stuff
[21:41:15] <EasyCo> It's when I was playing around
[21:41:19] <EasyCo> wrong code :)
[21:41:25] <chee> :D
[21:41:49] <EasyCo> better: http://jsfiddle.net/zrbje/4/
[21:42:15] <Cork> looks the same to me
[21:42:29] <EasyCo> There was a few major typos mistakes
[21:43:15] <Cork> EasyCo: what on earth is func.call(this, event); meant to do?
[21:43:21] <Cork> thats completly pointless
[21:43:31] <EasyCo> Cork: Probably ;)
[21:44:09] <Cork> anyway whats the point your trying to make?
[21:44:25] <Cork> promptBooking should do...?
[21:45:29] <EasyCo> I think I just need to restructure my code. The point I'm trying to make is I want one shared function in charge of display the boxes and then each box should have their own function to take care of the functionality.
[21:45:34] <EasyCo> There I said it.
[21:46:01] <Cork> and thats normally done through adding different event listners :)
[21:46:16] <Cork> like /1/ does
[21:46:42] <aqeel> for boxes sspecify css classes different and call upon it
[21:47:23] <EasyCo> That would make things a lot simpler wouldn't it :)
[21:47:41] <EasyCo> Thank god it's the weekend in 15 minutes
[21:47:43] <subbyyy> anyone here can tell me what the formula is to position a javascript context menu on screen?mine always seems to pop up wayyy to the right of my div
[21:48:14] <EasyCo> Cork: As always, thanks for the help
[21:48:20] <EasyCo> aqeel: Cheers as well.
[21:48:42] <Cork> subbyyy: you prob have an offset parent that shifts things around
[21:48:46] <Cork> EasyCo: np
[21:50:17] <aqeel> EasyCo any time
[21:51:08] <EasyCo> I'll chuck it all on GitHub when it's finished so you can see what the hell I'm doing, if you're at all interested that is.
[21:52:12] <aqeel> posiiton......subbyyy......what exactly.....u are positioning....
[21:52:17] <radiantstatic> TNA - thanks!
[21:53:11] <subbyyy> i more or less have a tree view, and on right click trying to create a context menu on top of the target
[21:53:12] <subbyyy>                 'left': (e.pageX - $(e.target).scrollLeft()) + 'px',
[21:53:12] <subbyyy>                 'top': (e.pageY + $(e.target).scrollTop()) + 'px',
[21:53:28] <subbyyy> sorry for the spam
[21:54:00] <Cork> subbyyy: what whats the parent of the menu?
[21:54:08] <Cork> body?
[21:54:21] <aqeel> wrap it into a container
[21:54:31] <TNA-MichaelK> radiantstatic: did that work for you?
[21:54:40] <radiantstatic> TNA-MichaelK: Checking now
[21:54:45] <aqeel> and hook it with mouse pointer
[21:54:48] <Cork> subbyyy: btw you don't want to use scrollTop/Left to position your menu
[21:54:53] <subbyyy> i see
[21:55:07] <aqeel> well that is for scrolling purposes...
[21:55:26] <TNA-MichaelK> you could also through it in a window.onload() or something
[21:55:26] <Cork> there shouldn't be a need for that
[21:55:44] <TNA-MichaelK> throw****
[21:57:02] <radiantstatic> TNA-MichaelK: The entire thing?
[21:57:07] <aqeel> for posiitoning use http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Mouse_Position            subbyyy
[21:57:43] <subbyyy> i see, thanks, ill try this out
[21:58:39] <TNA-MichaelK> radiantstatic: I'd say, if you were to do window.onload(), throw your function definition and then call your function after
[21:58:45] <TNA-MichaelK> all in the onload
[22:02:39] <felixqc> hey
[22:02:57] <felixqc> i load an accordion into a modal dialog
[22:03:38] <felixqc> when i close the dialog, i use:  $(this).dialog('destroy').remove()
[22:03:59] <felixqc> but if i try to reopen exactly the same dialog again, the accordion is not there
[22:04:59] <felixqc> it is not rendered
[22:06:15] <Cork> subbyyy: http://jsfiddle.net/7z5bP/1/
[22:06:53] <radiantstatic> Cork: Any ideas as to why my image fadeIn/Outs aren't displaying? - http://thevanderbuilts.com/splash/
[22:08:34] <Cork> radiantstatic: <script type="text/javascript"
[22:08:40] <Cork> your script file isn't loaded
[22:10:18] <subbyyy> cork, thanks alot
[22:10:32] <Cork> radiantstatic: and you have an illegal character at line 16
[22:10:41] <Cork> (in fading-images.js)
[22:11:43] <Cork> subbyyy: yrw
[22:11:49] <radiantstatic> Cork: Thanks I will get at it
[22:16:47] <radiantstatic> Cork: working! Thank you very much! Any ideas how to prevent the images from shifting on fadeOut? I know why its happening, just looking for a way to combat it - http://thevanderbuilts.com/splash/
[22:18:16] <Cork> radiantstatic: position absolute instead of float
[22:18:31] <radiantstatic> Cork: ok great
[22:18:54] <Cork> radiantstatic: what happens is, when the image ends its fading
[22:18:58] <Cork> it gets display: none
[22:19:06] <Cork> and that shifts the other images
[22:19:33] <Cork> radiantstatic: don't forget you want position: relative; on "left"
[22:19:45] <Cork> else you will get a world of pain if you ever move the image
[22:19:54] <_eagspoo> I see that widget factory in jquery.ui 1.9 will have support for _super.   Is there a commit or branch that is stable enough for daily use now?   That would clean up a lot for me.
[22:20:06] <radiantstatic> Cork: gotcha. great. ty so much for you help, again.
[22:20:16] <Cork> np
[22:21:57] <radiantstatic> Cork: When #left is changed to position: relative, right shifts down. how would i combat this (more of a #css question i figure)
[22:23:03] <Cork> radiantstatic: it shouldn't
[22:23:09] <Cork> and it doesn't for me >_>
[22:23:15] <Cork> what browser?
[22:23:52] <Cork> (make sure you don't forget ; or something like that so float: left; gets invalid or something like that :)
[22:26:01] <radiantstatic> chrome - just uploaded - ignore the false positioning of the images - http://thevanderbuilts.com/splash/
[22:26:05] <radiantstatic> Cork: ^
[22:26:33] <Cork> radiantstatic: you shouldn't remove float: left;
[22:27:07] <radiantstatic> Cork: :-)
[22:27:16] <Cork> :D
[22:27:17] <radiantstatic> Cork: I'm not so smart. Got it.
[22:27:30] <Cork> na, don't be so hard on your self
[22:27:56] <Cork> radiantstatic: sounds like you haven't done this before so:
[22:28:06] <Cork> when you add position: relative; to an element
[22:28:15] <Cork> it becomes an "offset parent"
[22:28:19] <aqeel> float versus position relative not again....lol
[22:28:38] <mindis|wurk> it's a shame you can't chain relative-absolute-relative-absolute
[22:28:39] <Cork> that means when you do position: absolute; on elements inside it
[22:29:00] <Cork> they will refere to the parents position on the page instead of the page
[22:29:14] <Cork> mindis|wurk: chain?
[22:29:49] <radiantstatic> Cork:  Much appreciated. Yes, I'm just getting started. Overwhelming certainly but fun to learn nonetheless.
[22:29:52] <aqeel> position absolute is with your mon size and relative is parent child relationship
[22:30:11] <Cork> ah
[22:30:36] <mindis|wurk> Cork yeah. if you have a relative great grandparent, absolute grandparent, relative parent and an absolute child the child uses the great grandparent for reference instead of the parent
[22:30:43] <aqeel> float is altogether different concept
[22:31:59] <Cork> what i miss the most is that position: fixed; is always relative to the window
[22:32:15] <Cork> would have been grate if it was relative to its overflown parent
[22:33:07] <Cork> <div id="dialog" style="overflow:scroll"><div id="toolbar" style="position:fixed;top:0;left:0;right:0"></div></div>
[22:33:24] <felixqc> hi
[22:33:47] <felixqc> first time i call .accordion() for new modal window, it works.
[22:33:48] <aqeel> posiiton helps to break out of barrier but float always stays put.....
[22:33:58] <felixqc> second time i call it, it does not work... any ideas?
[22:35:51] <aqeel> float must have in one way or other width property but position can expand itself using top,left,right,bottom
[22:36:35] <mindis|wurk> which can lead to some odd combinations
[22:37:00] <mindis|wurk> iirc an element that has its width defined through left and right doesn't have a width :/
[22:39:45] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[22:39:49] <aqeel> position?
[22:41:25] <aqeel> there is no width property on any of the element on the page u see
[22:59:57] <aro> im using a scroll plugin to scroll side content down as the user scrolls down the page - but for some reason as the user scrolls down and the side content scrolls down - it increases the page height proportionally to how far down the page the user has scrolled.. any ideas?
[23:00:38] <aro> another thing to note, is that this is a tree menu that is collapsed by default
[23:00:45] <aro> so i dont know if it takes up phantom spce
[23:01:09] <Cork> aro: if its positioned absolute and has some margin below, that will happen
[23:02:10] <aro> its neither absolute, nor has any margin
[23:02:30] <Cork> how are you positioning the content?
[23:02:36] <aqeel> aro scroll plugin?
[23:02:46] <aro> jscroll, but i modified it to my needs
[23:03:07] <aqeel> http://sites.google.com/site/danielgidmanresume/history/jquery-aautoscroll'
[23:03:23] <aro> 4-oh-4
[23:03:30] <aro> oh
[23:03:32] <aro> '
[23:04:13] <aro> i dont think this is what i want
[23:04:43] <aro> i have a page with two divs side by side - one is short and the other is very long
[23:04:57] <aro> as the long one scrolls downward, the small one on the left scrolls into view
[23:05:00] <aro> as the user scrolls
[23:05:01] <aro> make sense?
[23:05:30] <aqeel> put left scroll div as posiiton fixed
[23:06:10] <aqeel> so right scrolls and left stays put on screen
[23:06:27] <aro> remove the plugin completely?
[23:09:10] <aqeel> some more samples...http://flowplayer.org/tools/scrollable/
[23:09:37] <aqeel> this has lots of example
[23:09:39] <aqeel> http://www.simonbattersby.com/blog/vertical-scrollbar-using-jquery-ui-slider/
[23:14:03] <aro> its weird, it works fine, its just that the imaginary space is causing the height to increase
[23:14:55] <aqeel> aro fiddle?
[23:15:03] <aro> all this jscroll plugin does is increase the top margin
[23:15:04] <aro> hang on
[23:15:10] <aro> will do jsfilddle
[23:43:22] <aro> fark i cant reproduce it
[23:56:01] <Xotix> How do i disable a submit button? so i can use $.post?
[23:58:24] <Xotix> got it
[23:59:31] <jkline> xotix $('#form-foo').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $.post(...) })
[23:59:47] <Xotix> jkline: yes, i always forget about preventDefault. :)
