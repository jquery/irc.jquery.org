[00:01:20] <hubbl3> darksnake747: Again, chillin' on my Igloo. Heh
[00:01:41] <darksnake747> haha yea
[00:01:48] <darksnake747> awesome man...
[00:08:18] <kratsg> When using $.on() with jQuery, how can we make our own hover() that bubbles correctly (using a combination of mouseenter/mouseleave)?
[00:08:24] <justanewbie> <div onclick=""> using in jquery 1.4.4 not works on IE8 ,any sugguestions?
[00:14:50] <darksnake747> HECK YES - got it!
[00:14:57] <darksnake747> @.@
[00:15:22] <darksnake747> justanewbie...
[00:15:54] <darksnake747> if you are on jquery, have you tried binding that div to the action?
[00:38:10] <justanewbie> darksnake747: yeap
[00:38:33] <darksnake747> ah...
[00:38:48] <darksnake747> so the .click or .bind did nothing for you...
[00:38:52] <justanewbie> darksnake747: i'm using $('#elem').html('<div onclick="somefunction"'),it works with firefox but not ie
[00:39:15] <darksnake747> yea... well
[00:39:36] <justanewbie> darksnake747: any way to do this more simple?
[00:39:36] <darksnake747> I mean to say try actually using JQuery bind or click functions
[00:40:08] <blackice2999> why not simple use .click() ?
[00:40:11] <darksnake747> I assume that this code - $('#elem').html('<div onclick="somefunction"') - is run when you click a button or something?
[00:40:25] <justanewbie> darksnake747: yes
[00:40:30] <darksnake747> so... do something like this...
[00:41:33] <justanewbie> darksnake747: a lot of work for me to do ,all the js is using <div onclick,if i choose to using .click or .bind manually i'll modify a lot of my code
[00:42:09] <justanewbie> darksnake747: any one line code solution?
[00:43:15] <darksnake747> function YourFunction() { $('#elem').html('<div id="mydivid"></div>'); $('div#mydivid').click(function() { YourExistingOnclickFunction(); }); }
[00:43:29] <darksnake747> copy paste that out... like..
[00:44:33] <darksnake747> http://pastebin.com/CYfje1V0
[00:44:38] <darksnake747> check that out...
[00:44:41] <justanewbie> darksnake747: one thousand and one thanks to u,i'll manage it out
[00:45:03] <darksnake747> honestly  - will probably be most successful and easiest to do...
[00:45:24] <justanewbie> :D
[00:45:56] <darksnake747> I write professional pure JavaScript and can say cross browser stuff is sucky - that is the only REAL benefit to using JQuery in my mind... so, in this case... this may be the best fix
[00:46:08] <darksnake747> hope it helps you man =)
[00:58:57] <darksnake747> well... that all for me
[00:59:01] <darksnake747> later everyone
[01:07:17] <ale24> adjusting a <div> to load different content, animated, on click of a link is possible. but for the "hand-cursor" to show up the <a> needs href="foobar". what is best practice to set foobar on?
[01:07:51] <Muka> Hi
[01:07:53] <Muka> good day
[01:08:30] <Muka> any freelance jquery expert ?
[01:09:01] <Muka> small job
[01:19:50] <Dunstkreis> does anybody have a link for me, where this event bubbling stuff is explained?
[01:21:26] <Dunstkreis> in context of jQuery and .click method of course
[01:40:00] <sweb> is it true ? "#status li:has(.result):not(.dehover)" ?
[01:43:26] <sweb> Zzz
[01:43:27] <sweb> Zzz
[01:43:53] <lubacha> Someone experiences with the resize-Plugin from ben-alman?
[01:47:21] <sweb> every body is going away
[02:25:16] <intellilogic> $.ajax  --  success: function(responseHTML){ DefaultSheet = responseHTML; } }); console.log(DefaultSheet);   "an empty string"   how can I get the value of that variable out of there?  I want to use it right after that, but in something more global than the success function.
[02:27:25] <hubbl3> intellilogic: write the console.log() inside success
[02:29:33] <intellilogic> Please read, my objective is to get the variable out.
[02:32:01] <hubbl3> Oh sorry, how 'bout setting async to false?
[03:02:12] <reecefowell> hey guys, if i use jQuery is it no longer possible to call a javascript action from a button press via onclick="" ?
[03:02:39] <jastor> you can still use onclick="" but you really shouldnt
[03:03:12] <reecefowell> but i need my function to be aware of some specific things
[03:03:55] <jastor> reecefowell, like?
[03:04:23] <reecefowell> namely when a button is pressed, it needs to know 2 things, which text area the button is working on, and 1-2 strings in an array
[03:04:42] <reecefowell> the array of 1-2 strings is specific to that button
[03:04:46] <dabear> and WHY do you need an onclick attribute for that?
[03:04:49] <reecefowell> each button will have something different
[03:04:54] <jastor> and what stops you from doing this in jquery?
[03:04:58] <dabear> reecefowell: use data attributes
[03:05:07] <reecefowell> whelp, I'm a JS noob, and query is a whole new level lol
[03:05:17] <reecefowell> *jquery
[03:05:29] <dabear> <a data-my-unique-value="bar">
[03:05:35] <reecefowell> data attributes, hmmm is that in the main docs? i did not see it
[03:07:05] <reecefowell> so will made up properties in html cause any issues with html validators?
[03:07:41] <reecefowell> i.e is it W3C compliant to do that?
[03:07:50] <Shagshag> ‡∑Å‡∑î‡∂∑ ‡∂Ö‡∑Ö‡∑î‡∂≠‡∑ä ‡∂Ö‡∑Ä‡∑î‡∂ª‡∑î‡∂Ø‡∑ä‡∂Ø‡∂ö‡∑ä ‡∑Ä‡∑ö‡∑Ä‡∑è
[03:07:59] <dabear> reecefowell: it is compatible with the html 5 validator, yes
[03:08:09] <dabear> data attributes are in the html5 spec
[03:08:12] <dabear> reecefowell: http://jsfiddle.net/hzt3P/
[03:08:15] <reecefowell> cool
[03:08:35] <reecefowell> curious looking website lol
[03:09:03] <reecefowell> looks like ass though
[03:09:08] <dabear> ?jsfiddle @ reecefowell
[03:09:09] <bot-t> reecefowell, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[03:09:54] <reecefowell> thanks
[03:10:04] <reecefowell> i can definitely use that :d
[03:10:05] <reecefowell> :D
[03:12:00] <Dunstkreis> reecefowell: you could have a look on the .parent / .parents selector of jQuery, with those its quite easy to work on parents, and e.g the parent form and again their childrens...
[03:13:16] <reecefowell> thanks, good advice, is it better though to specify the target-textarea param though?
[03:13:31] <reecefowell> then jQuery can just find that data attribute
[03:13:45] <reecefowell> or is the other method more reliable
[03:13:57] <reecefowell> I'm going by the text area's id attribute to find it
[03:14:15] <Dunstkreis> ids are fast and save to find.... (faster than classes...)
[03:14:44] <Dunstkreis> but i dont know whats about data stuff, never had to the use or need for working with that...
[03:14:55] <reecefowell> actually i do need to use the by id, if i try the other method of the parent it won't work, because i am using php/symfony and this is part of a form field type i have created, and there could be multiple instances of this
[03:16:02] <Dunstkreis> pardon? multiple instances? didnt get it, do you mind giving an code example?
[03:16:41] <reecefowell> i could but its for symfony, unless you use it, you might not get it
[03:16:59] <reecefowell> in symfony you can define your own form field types
[03:17:17] <Dunstkreis> k, but multiple instances <-> i-tag!? or what are you talking about?
[03:17:32] <reecefowell> i have created a bbcode field type (aka a textarea with a strip of buttons), and a form may have multiple fields utilising the bbcode field type
[03:18:40] <Dunstkreis> okay. i meant resulting the html code, not your symfony code...
[03:19:37] <reecefowell> ok hold on, need to clean something up in it first
[03:21:59] <reecefowell> http://www.pastie.org/private/zzfqjiunooizmrcqife8ka
[03:22:18] <reecefowell> Dunstkreis: thats the html mostly, as for the JS have not really wrote anything yet, still a work in progress
[03:24:22] <reecefowell> http://pastie.org/private/cjpuytjvtzudyzxykznw
[03:24:29] <reecefowell> thats better, was not colour coded before
[03:25:20] <Dunstkreis> okay, and in there you wanna do onclick stuff on the buttons?
[03:25:35] <reecefowell> yah, well was originally the plan
[03:25:55] <reecefowell> but ill follow the rules lol :P i mean however jQuery works, i can play along
[03:26:01] <Dunstkreis> and whats the background information you need?
[03:26:16] <reecefowell> 1) target-textarea
[03:26:22] <reecefowell> 2) the bb code atags
[03:26:24] <reecefowell> *tags
[03:27:28] <Dunstkreis> let me guess, the buttons seems allways to be within the same div.bb_editor_widget, is that right?
[03:27:41] <reecefowell> yeah
[03:28:04] <reecefowell> the whole snippet in the link is the component i made, it is a re-usable form field type
[03:28:21] <reecefowell> so the buttons should always accompany the textarea
[03:28:28] <Dunstkreis> so, you could select the buttons and handle the onclick stuff with $('button.bb_button').click(function(event){ ... });
[03:29:08] <reecefowell> hmm
[03:29:20] <reecefowell> but that does not tell me what the text area is
[03:30:19] <Dunstkreis> and for the ... you could "select" the actual clicked button through $(this). then, you continue searching in all parents for the matching class: $(this).parenst('div.bb_editor_widget') and from there go down to the textarea: $(this).parenst('div.bb_editor_widget').find('textarea').doSomething();
[03:30:30] <dabear> reecefowell: attributes should start with data-*
[03:30:31] <reecefowell> the JS needs to know that the buttons belong to a particular text area is what i mean
[03:30:34] <reecefowell> oh
[03:30:35] <reecefowell> ok
[03:30:39] <dabear> data-target-textarea
[03:31:07] <Dunstkreis> *.parents <- misspelled that...
[03:31:09] <reecefowell> dabear: thanks fixed
[03:31:57] <dabear> reecefowell:  $('button.bb_button').click(function(event){     var $this = $(this); var targetEditorID = $this.data("target-editor")   })
[03:32:23] <dabear> so $(targetEditorID) would point to the target editor
[03:32:49] <reecefowell> hmm let me test that with an alert box, see if it works for what i need
[03:33:17] <Dunstkreis> dabear but he would need to know which textarea is meant within the generating code - or do i mess up something there?
[03:35:18] <reecefowell> Dunstkreis: i think you got what i mean, yeah the form field is can be used multiple times within a form
[03:35:36] <reecefowell> so need to know the exact text area that owns the buttons, even though its in the same form
[03:36:39] <Dunstkreis> yes, you only need to go up to the next comon element, and down / search / .find() from there for the textarea...
[03:42:00] <reecefowell> so does parents go up multiple levels until it finds the parent containing what you are looking for?
[03:42:47] <_zoggy_> just one level
[03:42:53] <_zoggy_> .parent().parent() goes up 2
[03:43:14] <_zoggy_> but you really should use .find if you need more than 1 parent
[03:43:19] <reecefowell> oh, so not plural then parent(s)
[03:43:26] <BinaryKitten> _zoggy_ find won't work
[03:43:36] <BinaryKitten> find looks down, not up
[03:43:42] <_zoggy_> right
[03:43:50] <BinaryKitten> so find won't go to a parent
[03:43:50] <Dunstkreis> no, _zoggy_ parentS goes "up" to body. within .parentS you have ALL elements upwards including the body tag, and within this set you need to select with a matching selector
[03:43:51] <_zoggy_> so you just use ('#whatever').find()
[03:43:58] <reecefowell> in my case, its up then down
[03:43:59] <reecefowell> i think
[03:44:03] <_zoggy_> ?? .parents()
[03:44:10] <BinaryKitten> ?.parents @ _zoggy_
[03:44:10] <bot-t> _zoggy_, .parents([selector]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parents/
[03:44:20] <Dunstkreis> http://api.jquery.com/parents/
[03:44:31] <reecefowell> parent.parent.parent.find("textarea")
[03:44:52] <_zoggy_> yes correct
[03:45:00] <_zoggy_> use parents
[03:45:13] <_zoggy_> but i would think that would be a slow way to traverse the dom tree
[03:45:32] <BinaryKitten> not so much really..
[03:45:36] <reecefowell> hmm
[03:45:37] <_zoggy_> add class/id and use that to narrow your search
[03:45:41] <BinaryKitten> reecefowell  does the 2nd parent have a class/id?
[03:46:28] <reecefowell> http://pastie.org/private/qdyuazvnnqd6hed1tmw
[03:46:38] <reecefowell> its 3 divs deep
[03:46:45] <reecefowell> they all have classes
[03:46:48] <reecefowell> no ids
[03:46:52] <BinaryKitten> ok
[03:47:02] <reecefowell> but id would be no good
[03:47:13] <reecefowell> because it would not be unique
[03:47:18] <Dunstkreis> and working on classes should be slower than the triple .parent thing?!
[03:47:30] <reecefowell> no idea :S
[03:47:36] <reecefowell> am a JS noob
[03:47:43] <Dunstkreis> asking BinaryKitten and _zoggy_
[03:47:47] <reecefowell> :)
[03:48:08] <BinaryKitten> $(this).parents('.tool_strip_container').next('textarea')
[03:48:10] <_zoggy_> well depends on how big your DOM is really...
[03:48:32] <reecefowell> BinaryKitten: that looks like it could work, ill test it
[03:48:35] <BinaryKitten> or $(this).parent().parent().next('textarea')
[03:49:23] <BinaryKitten> in the end there is only going to be a minute amount of difference
[03:49:40] <_zoggy_> im not against parent
[03:50:01] <_zoggy_> just against chaining things blindly hoping that it's going to always land on your target since your not using any selectors
[03:50:02] <BinaryKitten> nor am I, but i tend to go to parents for multiple steps
[03:50:20] <BinaryKitten> _zoggy_ were on the same page about blindly chaining
[03:50:21] <reecefowell> how do i print the text area id? alert("Hello " + textarea.data("id")); does not seem to work, it says 'hello undefined'
[03:50:21] <_zoggy_> your suggestion of using a parent with selector i'd think is a lot more efficent
[03:50:34] <BinaryKitten> ?.attr @ reecefowell
[03:50:34] <bot-t> reecefowell, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[03:50:57] <reecefowell> yay
[03:50:59] <reecefowell> it works
[03:51:00] <BinaryKitten> why do you need the id?
[03:51:05] <Dunstkreis> _zoggy_: thats right, just hoping is not the very best idea, but if you know, that there will allways be 3 divs around the buttons... .parent().parten() shouldnt be a problem!?
[03:51:05] <reecefowell> it found the post body
[03:51:21] <reecefowell> BinaryKitten: because thats the specific text area it needs to be putting the bbcode tags into
[03:51:39] <reecefowell> but, i guess i don't actually need the id
[03:51:41] <_zoggy_> couldnt he use .text()
[03:51:41] <reecefowell> because it found it
[03:51:57] <reecefowell> i just wanted to see for myself that it found what i wanted it to find
[03:52:13] <BinaryKitten> _zoggy_  .text wouldn't be so great  on that.. .val wouldd be the preferred option
[03:52:50] <Dunstkreis> _zoggy_ :D .text() ! :D i was trying and fiddling around with an example but completly forgot about .text () :D
[03:53:35] <reecefowell> so both of these work, which one did you guys say was best? 	var textarea = $(this).parent().parent().next('textarea'); OR var textarea = $(this).parents('.tool_strip_container').next('textarea');
[03:53:57] <reecefowell> i remember some debate over performance
[03:54:03] <BinaryKitten> reecefowell go for the latter
[03:54:11] <BinaryKitten> as it will stand up more against dom changes
[03:54:16] <reecefowell> the .tool_strip_container one
[03:54:19] <BinaryKitten> yep
[03:54:22] <reecefowell> thanks
[03:54:27] <reecefowell> you guys are all super helpful :)
[03:54:28] <Dunstkreis> thats right, but the double parent would be faster... :D
[03:54:34] <Dunstkreis> thats what he asked for. :)
[03:54:35] <BinaryKitten> when in doubt, be verbose
[03:54:53] <reecefowell> :)
[03:54:58] <Dunstkreis> but i would also recommend the parents('.class') method ..... ;)
[03:55:59] <reecefowell> as its not a load intensive process, and this is thus far the only javascript on my site, i don't anticipate performance being an issue, my primary concern is with it selecting the correct text area and not another one with identical buttons :) so its all looking good so far :)
[03:56:17] * BinaryKitten goes off to watch Captain America.
[03:56:31] <BinaryKitten> happy new year one and all if i don't see you
[03:56:47] <reecefowell> BinaryKitten: thanks, you too and thanks again, for the help :)
[03:56:50] <reecefowell> happy new year
[03:58:21] <Dunstkreis> reecefowell you are welcome, keep on learning selekting things with jQuery, its often easier than you first think and after you got used to it, you start building neat features for your sites... :)
[03:59:03] <reecefowell> i hope one day to have a cool AJAX website, but the php side of things takes precedence, particularly if there was anything for javascript to receive to begin with lol
[03:59:33] <Dunstkreis> btw, i guess you could do a little "speed up" to the code :)
[04:00:12] <Dunstkreis> parents('div.class') should be slightly faster than parents('.class')  ;)
[04:00:17] <reecefowell> for now though, I'm trying to use the least amount of JS as possible so to maintain best compatibility with funky browsers that don't like JS
[04:00:31] <reecefowell> Dunstkreis: thanks, ill fix that
[04:00:36] <BinaryKitten> Dunstkreis are you sure?
[04:00:40] <Dunstkreis> there a framework is allways a god idea
[04:01:19] <Dunstkreis> not exactly shure, but doesn jQuery filter the elements first so doesnt have to inspect all elements for the class attribute?
[04:01:29] * BinaryKitten runs tests on div.class over .class on jsperf
[04:01:41] <_zoggy_> too specific is bad
[04:01:46] * Dunstkreis is interessted in the results
[04:01:52] <Dunstkreis> it is?
[04:04:01] <_zoggy_> yes
[04:04:25] <_zoggy_> go read mr irish's presentation on selectors
[04:05:08] <reecefowell> _zoggy_: so i should remove the div part?
[04:05:16] <_zoggy_> http://jonraasch.com/blog/10-advanced-jquery-performance-tuning-tips-from-paul-irish
[04:05:21] <_zoggy_> has a decent overview of it
[04:06:03] <reecefowell> ooh i watched a video of paul irish on youtube, 'things i learnt about jquery'. like a year ago, still remember it though
[04:06:15] <reecefowell> most of what he said went over my head, but fascinating stuff
[04:06:20] <BinaryKitten> Dunstkreis http://jsperf.com/test-of-tag-class-over-class
[04:07:16] <Dunstkreis> BinaryKitten there my solution would be faster1?
[04:07:29] <BinaryKitten> tag.class runs slower than .class
[04:07:45] <Dunstkreis> !? :)
[04:07:49] <Dunstkreis> Not on my browser!? :D
[04:07:53] <BinaryKitten> urm it does
[04:08:06] <BinaryKitten> just saw the results
[04:08:08] <Dunstkreis> ah, okay, ops / sec not sec ! :D *GG*
[04:08:18] <BinaryKitten> lol
[04:08:25] <_zoggy_> As of version 1.3, jQuery has been using the Sizzle Javascript Selector Library which works a bit differently from the selector engine used in the past. Namely it uses a ‚Äòright to left‚Äô model rather than a ‚Äòleft to right‚Äô, which means that given a selector string such as $('div.class span.class2') the engine starts the search on the right using the most specific selector (the span.class2)
[04:08:25] <_zoggy_> and then checks each ancestor against div.class rather than starting on the left and checking descendants.
[04:08:32] <_zoggy_> which is why tag.class is slower
[04:08:51] <_zoggy_> it first finds all the .class, then searches that list for tag
[04:08:54] <Dunstkreis> reecefowell, hav a look at the last link BinaryKitten wrote... and forget what i said! :D
[04:08:57] <reecefowell> i have not even written my bbcode inserting function, and already i am optimising yay
[04:09:12] <_zoggy_> not a huge deal with a small dom / super powerful comp+decent browser
[04:09:14] <BinaryKitten> beware of premature optimisation
[04:09:24] <reecefowell> thats what she said
[04:09:24] <BinaryKitten> it gets real sticky real fast
[04:09:30] <reecefowell> she said that also
[04:09:31] <_zoggy_> but being too specific is just bad to do
[04:09:49] <BinaryKitten> reecefowell that is indeed what she (me) sai
[04:09:51] <BinaryKitten> *said
[04:09:57] <reecefowell> haha
[04:10:19] <Dunstkreis> thank you folks, ill go around my jQuery codes!!! :D
[04:10:42] <reecefowell> so i removed the div part now, so next up. write this function haha
[04:10:43] <Dunstkreis> right to left, gosh, how should one guess that?
[04:11:05] <BinaryKitten> Dunstkreis it's how CSS works
[04:11:32] <BinaryKitten> anyway.. i'll continue this downstairs on laptop
[04:11:33] <Dunstkreis> CSS to? So i could speed up the rendering process in the browser to?
[04:11:35] <reecefowell> i guess it makes sense to match right hand first, seeing as a class name is going to be less frequent than the tag it is applied to on average
[04:13:10] <Dunstkreis> yea, reecefowell, but if i wanna select a specific element type lets say <a ...>, kicking out all other elements in first would be quite effective - i thought till today... :)
[04:13:16] <Kit-10> right.. so what did i miss whilst getting laptop?
[04:13:30] <reecefowell> i guess
[04:13:35] <Dunstkreis> CSS too? So i could speed up the rendering process in the browser to?
[04:14:00] <reecefowell> any rate, thanks a bunch guys, i am now gonna grab some brunch, take a break then return to finish this function lol
[04:19:02] <Dunstkreis> Kit-10 so with an #id that should be the same i guess?? div#id doesnt speed up, instead it even slows it down? .. ill have to rewrite some lines of code right now! :D *gg* But does the browser css engine works like that too? so less specific would be faster there too?
[04:20:22] <Kit-10> yep it does Dunstkreis
[04:20:26] <Kit-10> especially with #id
[04:20:42] <Kit-10> if a selector is only #id jquery passes through to document.getElementById
[04:20:52] <Dunstkreis> in this belief i allways used things like $('div#oben div#main') :D *gg* i've been a fool ty a lot, Kit-10 !!!!
[04:21:05] <solidus-lake> is it bad mojo to use .on or .delegate on a fairly root element of the dom?
[04:21:30] <Kit-10> solidus-lake use it on the lowest possible common point
[04:22:43] <solidus-lake> Kit-10: aye, should i use .on or delegate?
[04:23:26] <Kit-10> if you're using 1.7+ .on in delegate mode
[04:23:58] <Kit-10> if you're using 1.7+ you should always use .on/.off for all event related stuff
[04:24:21] <solidus-lake> Kit-10: .on is confusing, i'm looking at the api page, which mode is delegate mode?
[04:24:24] <Kit-10> $('commonancester').on('event', 'childselector', fn() )
[04:24:34] <solidus-lake> Kit-10: cool :)
[04:24:45] <Kit-10> ?.on
[04:24:46] <bot-t> Kit-10, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[04:25:04] <solidus-lake> Kit-10: i should change all .live things to .on as well then
[04:25:08] <solidus-lake> correct?
[04:25:56] <Kit-10> live is old as well, but is a different kettle of fish
[04:26:08] <Kit-10> if you pastebin your live code i can advise better
[04:26:35] <MariusKarthaus> Hi, I have a $.ajax post that is executed upon a click on a span. The result of the POST is sometimes a json object that tells by script to do something. But in certain cases the result should be a 'file download', i'm setting headers line 'content-disposition' etc, but to no avail.. the result is not offered as a file to the client. (it is downloaded but kept as data internal to the script). Is this aat all possible and how?
[04:27:42] <Kit-10> you can't download via ajax MariusKarthaus
[04:28:17] <solidus-lake> Kit-10: what's the difference, i tihnk i might have an idea. Right now live is bieng used to apply functions on objects that come in and out of the dom, but not necisarily triggered by any event except that the dom is changing,
[04:28:41] <MariusKarthaus> Kit-10: that is a shame. So the only way to download is using a link that does a GET?
[04:28:56] <solidus-lake> Kit-10: i think i get it, .live is just short hand for setting a delegate on the root document element?
[04:29:31] <Kit-10> MariusKarthaus yes, you can check the headers and then set window.location.href to match
[04:29:50] <Dunstkreis> MariusKarthaus you could try setting the URL to the file / download and then force the browser to reload ...
[04:29:57] <Dunstkreis> ...
[04:30:43] <Kit-10> solidus-lake yep live is like that
[04:31:02] <Kit-10> but you can get better performance depending on what you're after
[04:31:26] <Kit-10> take this oppotunity to filter the selectors and improve the code
[04:31:31] <MariusKarthaus> setting window.location seems like a good solution, i'll try that.
[04:32:34] <solidus-lake> Kit-10: yeah, that sounds good, however this site loads pretty much everything via ajax and the only place i could really attach this stuff to is pretty much the root, i guess i could filter out quite a bit, but most of the dynamic changes all happen in one div
[04:32:38] <solidus-lake> meh, worth a percentage
[04:32:52] <Kit-10> well, while you are rewriting
[04:36:59] <solidus-lake> hmm, interesting, what if i don't want any events to trigger the function
[04:37:16] <solidus-lake> i want to use .on to run some initialization code on certain elements of the same class now and in the future
[04:37:39] <solidus-lake> is there a better way to do this?
[04:37:52] <Rotham> hey... trying to use the datepicker formatDate function.. how can I do something like this:  $.fn.datepicker('formateDate','yy-m-d',"Sat Dec 31 2011 07:26:30 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)",{}) from outside of a jquery plugin?
[04:43:46] <Kit-10> solidus-lake there's no way to actively "on new items added do X"
[04:44:21] <solidus-lake> Kit-10: damn, i was hoping i could use .one with some event that would be triggered whenever there was a new object that matched the filter
[04:44:50] <solidus-lake> Kit-10: hmm, this makes it tough to initialize anything thats loaded via ajax without using ugly inline javascript from your views :\
[04:44:57] <Kit-10> .on is for event delegation   .one is just a wrapper to handle a single instance event
[04:45:24] <Andreas2k4> how to make synchronous ajax request non-blocking?
[04:45:39] <Kit-10> Andreas2k4 define non-blocking?
[04:45:53] <solidus-lake> i'm using 2 libraries that need to be initialized on the objects on the page, but i REALLY don't want to rely on javascript in my views to initialize them :(, i guess the battle is lost on these 2 areas
[04:45:56] <Kit-10> solidus-lake you could add a callback on to all ajax responses
[04:46:11] <Kit-10> which you could then handle a search and initialise
[04:46:37] <solidus-lake> Kit-10: that sounds badass, but would that involve making my own event? i'm new to jquery
[04:46:43] <Andreas2k4> non-blocking = animations are not damn slow
[04:46:59] <sssspt> Good moring all.
[04:47:09] <solidus-lake> sssspt: mornin :)
[04:47:11] <Kit-10> Andreas2k4 animations are not ajax though
[04:47:14] <sssspt> I have a problem with $.post, it doesn't wait the response of my page. How can I resolve this problem ? Please.
[04:47:15] <Andreas2k4> from jquery ajax docs: Note that synchronous requests may temporarily lock the browser, disabling any actions while the request is active.
[04:47:30] <Andreas2k4> this also inclues animations
[04:47:38] <Kit-10> synchronous
[04:47:42] <solidus-lake> sssspt: if your trying to only run it on page load use $(function(){})
[04:47:57] <Kit-10> why are you using synchronous?
[04:48:45] <sssspt> solidus-lake : this is my code : $.post("ajax/mypage.jsp", {email:$("#email").val()}, function(data){myCodeHere}
[04:48:47] <Andreas2k4> because i'm fireing 3-5 request immediatly with callback functions (incl. animations) but i have to preserve the order
[04:49:30] <Kit-10> Andreas2k4 the issue then is not the synchronous blocking, it's maintaining order
[04:49:44] <Kit-10> do all the requests have to be performed at the same time?
[04:50:00] <Andreas2k4> they are performed in a for loop
[04:50:02] <sssspt> solidus-lake : this code is in a function out of page load
[04:50:21] <Kit-10> Andreas2k4 http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/ajaxqueue
[04:50:57] <Kit-10> that might be helpful for you
[04:52:40] <Andreas2k4> can't find the download  :-O
[04:53:49] <solidus-lake> Kit-10: aha! if your using rails you can do $('parent selecctor').on('ajax:success', 'filter', handler);
[04:54:42] <sssspt> solidus-lake : you have any idea for me ?
[04:54:59] <solidus-lake> sssspt: sorry, :(
[04:59:08] <solidus-lake> sssspt: i can probably help, i bet someone around here will if you make a jsfiddle of it, i'm going to murder someone if i dont get some food in me soon though, been at the airport for the past 9 hours with a cup of coffee :\ bbl
[05:05:15] <MariusKarthaus> Kit-10: about the ajax file download, i've ended up using a hidden I frame with a POST that receives the file. That way the current page is kept even when the download fails. The location.href trick was not failure proof.
[05:17:36] <Kit-10> fair enough MariusKarthaus
[05:33:31] <JSsux> salam
[05:33:34] <JSsux> aghas man 1 soal daram
[05:33:42] <JSsux> hey guys
[05:33:49] <JSsux> i have a problem
[05:34:01] <JSsux> i need help :(
[05:34:18] <JSsux> how do u set the date to be displayed in the datepicker panel?
[05:41:23] <Dunstkreis> MariusKarthaus: you could have tested the result / headers, first make an ajax request, and if everything is okay (file type, 200 OK status msg etc) you could do the location.href thing... just another option, if you wanna get rid of the extra frame...
[06:04:27] <Alesk_o> hello
[06:04:39] <Alesk_o> i have a question with option, and selected option
[06:05:09] <Alesk_o> how can i do a specific action on a selected option ?
[06:05:31] <Alesk_o> i tried with .change() on the select
[06:06:25] <Kit-10> if (this.options[this.selectedIndex] == 'value') { @ Alesk_o
[06:06:58] <Alesk_o> hum !
[06:07:03] <Alesk_o> i will try :)
[06:09:49] <Alesk_o> Kit-10, i have this : Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'undefined' of undefined
[06:10:17] <Alesk_o> oh , i need to put it the change function ?
[06:21:36] <Kit-10> Alesk_o yes lol
[06:26:29] <Alesk_o> it don't work Kit-10
[06:30:56] <Dunstkreis> Alesk_o your crystal balls just broke yesterday, would you mind showing an example?
[06:31:29] <Dunstkreis> your -> our :)
[06:31:34] <Alesk_o> :p
[06:31:36] <Alesk_o> sure
[06:32:30] <JSsux> anyone knows how to change the date values in the datepicker?
[06:32:54] <JSsux> i want to transform it to show solar calendar
[06:32:55] <Kit-10> JSsux it's all listed in the docs for it
[06:33:05] <Kit-10> oh
[06:33:08] <JSsux> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker#options
[06:33:11] <Kit-10> you don't want a calendar
[06:33:17] <JSsux> couldn't find it
[06:33:18] <Kit-10> just want to change it completely
[06:33:36] <JSsux> i want to know when it takes the date
[06:33:39] <JSsux> which mathod
[06:33:54] <Alesk_o> here Dunstkreis , Kit-10 http://jsfiddle.net/yLt6w/
[06:34:00] <JSsux> so i can handle it to return a solar calendar
[06:34:51] <mehrdad> Kit-10, can u point it out to me?
[06:34:52] <mehrdad> :(
[06:34:59] <Kit-10> mehrdad what is solar calendar you want?
[06:35:05] <Kit-10> i mean what's the difference
[06:35:16] <mehrdad> it is an iranian calendar
[06:35:26] <mehrdad> i have the library to convert it
[06:35:51] <mehrdad> all i need now to know is how to interject the date of datepicker with my own date
[06:36:18] <solepixel> how would I go about loading an external JS file dynamically, then upon completion of said load, execute some more js?
[06:36:26] <mehrdad> i have little experience with jquery and my boss has forced it upon me to do it sooner than later
[06:36:46] <mehrdad> i am in a hurry
[06:36:49] <mehrdad> :(
[06:37:51] <Kit-10> mehrdad http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#method-setDate
[06:37:59] <dnsdds> How can determine the position of $(this) within a class selector that I expect to return multiple elements?
[06:39:35] <mehrdad> Kit-10, have read thru it before, but couldn't do a damn thing
[06:39:40] <mehrdad> let me try it again
[06:40:01] <mehrdad> i think it is because of my lack of experience with jquery
[06:43:48] <dnsdds> Anyone? :)
[06:47:04] <solepixel> dnsdds: loop through them with $.each() ?
[06:47:39] <dnsdds> Yeah but how do I get the position as a number?
[06:47:50] <dnsdds> From the left, that is
[06:47:57] <mehrdad> Kit-10, how to override it?
[06:48:09] <lxsameer> is it possible to have a "or" in selection ? for example $("div   or  a")  ( for selecting all the divs and a tags)?
[06:48:34] <solepixel> dnsdds: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+get+element+position
[06:48:35] <mehrdad> should i extend the base jquery library or edit it outright?
[06:49:51] <dnsdds> solepixel: No need to be snide.
[06:51:08] <solepixel> ;)

[10:33:13] <xxiao> anyone familiar with jquery's ajax async option?
[10:33:18] <xxiao> http://pastebin.com/dbv7nZst
[10:33:58] <xxiao> when async is false, my html page was updated corretly, when it's true, the response msg is correct(using firebug), but html page was not updated
[10:38:25] <kborchers> ?ajax101 @ xxiao
[10:38:26] <bot-t> xxiao, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[10:42:19] <intellilogic> My selector is not excluding lbltr_sheet, I am formatting it wrong, how can I do this properly?  find(":input:not([type='button'],[name='lbltr_sheet']), select")
[10:43:58] <Phrogz> intellilogic: No first comma.
[10:44:03] <xxiao> kborchers: the only difference is that i put dataReceived inside the doAjax() instead of outside, does that matter?
[10:44:21] <jastor> i got a good reason not to .. but why arent you out partying your assess off?
[10:44:24] <xxiao> i.e. the function to be called after ajas success
[10:44:40] <Phrogz> intellilogic: e.g. foo[type='button'][name='lbltr_sheet']
[10:45:13] <intellilogic> Phrogz: Still including it  find(":input:not([type='button'][name='lbltr_sheet']), select")
[10:45:53] <Phrogz> oh, you want all inputs that aren't buttons and don't have that name?
[10:46:48] <Phrogz> As just a selector syntax, I believe that would be     find("*:input:not([type='button']):not([name='lbltr_sheet'])"); Though I'd personally use a filter function for that.
[11:11:22] <Blaster> hey guys.. i'm trying to make a rating system with stars... so as you hover stars they become "on"
[11:11:23] <Blaster> http://jsfiddle.net/5xvXr/
[11:11:54] <Blaster> I wrote the code and it makes sense but it won't change the background image
[11:13:39] <Blaster> I wrote this other code which works perfectly but I want to condense it... any ideas how? http://pastebin.com/sf4jTzYs
[11:17:04] <Eviltwin> Blaster: Do you know what a switch statement is?
[11:18:26] <Eviltwin> Blaster: A switch statement is probably the best way to compress this
[11:23:51] <Blaster> Eviltwin:  yes I do... but couldn't I condense by getting the children of .rating and using a for loop to change the first X children background to starOn?
[11:24:14] <Eviltwin> http://pastebin.com/ZX0N5qRj
[11:26:01] <Blaster> Eviltwin:  Not bad but isn't it possible to target the nth child of an element?
[11:26:14] <Eviltwin> Yup
[11:26:39] <Eviltwin> And you've almost nailed the syntax in asking the question
[11:26:40] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[11:26:53] <Blaster> cool
[11:26:56] <Eviltwin> However I'd suggest doing it slightly differently
[11:27:22] <Eviltwin> Let's say all of the starts for this have class .star
[11:27:28] <Eviltwin> And you want them to fill in left to right
[11:27:56] <Eviltwin> You can do clearStars(); $(".star").lt(index).css('background-image', 'url(starOn.png)')
[11:28:20] <Blaster> so that will fill up to index?
[11:28:22] <Eviltwin> If index is 1, it gets all of the stars with 0-based indices less than 1
[11:28:43] <Blaster> what if index is 5?
[11:28:44] <Eviltwin> Err, hmm... looks like that's only available as a selector
[11:28:50] <Eviltwin> It's .slice(0,index)
[11:33:58] <Blaster> does the slice index have to be a class or can it be a selector?
[11:35:27] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/xDXzw/
[11:35:34] <Eviltwin>  http://jsfiddle.net/xDXzw/
[11:35:43] <Eviltwin> That's probably the best way actually
[11:36:44] <Blaster> nice demo
[11:37:20] <Eviltwin> So obviously your selectors will be a bit different
[11:37:21] <Blaster> padding is probably best to space the stars because using a margin makes it skip
[11:37:32] <Eviltwin> Entirely up to you
[11:37:33] <Blaster> when you mouse over the margin
[11:38:21] <Eviltwin> So see ?nextAll if you don't know what it does
[11:38:21] <bot-t> .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[11:44:55] <Blaster> Eviltwin:  Thanks... works perfect
[11:45:01] <Blaster> Now to integrate click....
[11:48:16] <Blaster> Eviltwin:  Is there a way to remove the clearStars callback so when clicking a star they all stay on?
[11:48:18] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/xDXzw/1/
[11:48:37] <Eviltwin> That was pre-staying on
[11:50:59] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/xDXzw/2/
[11:51:04] <Eviltwin> That's post-staying on
[11:53:52] <StPiere> is there somthing like scrollLeft but that works on hidden elements too?
[11:54:06] <Eviltwin> What do you mean?
[11:54:36] <Deafgoose> anybody here familiar with phpQuery?
[11:55:02] <StPiere> i have plugin, and i call scrollLeft within it, but at the time of page loading, element is hidden, so scrollLeft doesnt apply
[11:55:24] <StPiere> look note here http://api.jquery.com/scrollLeft/
[11:57:03] <Eviltwin> You might want to take a look at jQuery.swap
[11:57:09] <Eviltwin> It's not on the API
[11:57:23] <StPiere> i'll check that
[11:57:23] <Eviltwin> But it takes three arguments
[11:57:26] <StPiere> thanks
[11:57:39] <Eviltwin> The first one is the target DOM element
[11:57:50] <Eviltwin> The second is a series of CSS properties to set temporarily
[11:57:59] <Eviltwin> The third is a function that is called
[11:58:04] <Eviltwin> And after its called, the properties are restored
[11:58:39] <thrillERboy> I have two divs, first div have list of links, second div has divs corresponding those links, how do I fadeIn divs corresponding to the links clicked in the other div. Sorry for being vague, tell me the keywords that come to your mind, I'll google myself :)
[11:58:42] <Eviltwin> It's used internally several places
[11:59:03] <StPiere> thank you
[11:59:20] <Eviltwin> $.swap(elem,{ position: "absolute", visibility: "hidden", display: "block" },function(){/*computation that needs visiblity*/});
[11:59:46] <Eviltwin> Doesn't work if the parents are hidden

[12:27:45] <felipe_Brz> hi regarding ajax forms, is there a common way to have a button be the default button in a div? so it gets actived on 'enter' key being pressed? I mean, if we use a submit button then the script we have set in the action parameter will get rendered...
[12:28:34] <Eviltwin> Maybe something with tabindex
[12:28:48] <thrillERboy> $(".service_body[rel=2]").fadeIn();
[12:28:49] <thrillERboy>  This code works fine, but I want to substitute 2 in the rel value with variable hook, how to substitute the variable inside string?
[12:29:07] <Eviltwin> thrillERboy: String concatenation
[12:29:24] <Eviltwin> Or a filter function
[12:29:38] <thrillERboy> Okey, I thought there must be some #{} ;)
[12:29:53] <Eviltwin> This ain't Ruby
[12:31:10] <thrillERboy> Thanks a Lot Eviltwin, you were so helpful, finished my work :)
[12:31:32] <thrillERboy> Wish you all Happy New year!!
[12:31:45] * thrillERboy starts the new year with a productive day
[12:48:11] <felipe_Brz> is there a way to make a regular <button> be bound to the 'enter' key so it can act as a submit method b?
[12:50:56] <ajpiano> felipe_Brz: <button type="submit">
[12:51:45] <felipe_Brz> but then the script specified in <form action="foo.php" > will be called, and I will have no callback to handle the result?
[12:51:50] <felipe_Brz> ajpiano: ^
[12:51:58] <ajpiano> what
[12:52:32] <ajpiano> your question had nothing to do with that
[12:52:54] <felipe_Brz> ajpiano:  i'm sorry i'm not sure i've explained myself correctly
[12:53:03] <ajpiano> i'm sure you haven't :)
[12:53:26] <felipe_Brz> i want to be able to handle the response in a callback
[12:53:27] <ajpiano> felipe_Brz: if you want to get a "callback for the submit', bind a submit handler to the form
[12:53:35] <felipe_Brz> oh
[12:53:38] <ajpiano> are you planning to submit the form via ajax?
[12:53:44] <felipe_Brz> yes
[12:53:47] <ajpiano> ok then yes
[12:53:48] <felipe_Brz> i want no reloading
[12:53:54] <ajpiano> you have two separate issues
[12:54:12] <ajpiano> one is "how do i have a button act like a submit" the answer is <button type-"submit">
[12:54:22] <ajpiano> the second is how to submit the form via ajax, and that's with binding a submit handler to the form
[12:54:44] <felipe_Brz> ok i think my real problem was the second
[12:54:50] <felipe_Brz> i'll try the solution you gave me
[12:54:54] <felipe_Brz> thanks a lot
[13:03:28] <lucy-> i need something like this http://code.stephenmorley.org/javascript/collapsible-lists/ but 1. i need to colaps an opened tree if an other tree link is openned 2. i want to put tables or divs inside the each branch of tree instead of simple text in <li> . how can i do it
[13:18:54] <abjorn> :o
[13:35:08] <groklinux> is there a counterpart to .append like .clip or .remove or something like that?
[13:36:12] <Eviltwin> What?
[13:36:15] <groklinux> nvm got it...should have rtfm'd first
[14:59:52] <lrvick> Is there a way to get getJSON to send a custom header, or must I re-implemnt getJSON from scratch using $.ajax ?
[15:04:18] <RLa> lrvick, i'm using $.ajax here and it takes 2 lines to do normal request
[15:04:38] <TechieShane> I'm being logged on the web :D
[15:04:44] <lrvick> can you provide an example of how to do jsonp neatly with $.ajax ?
[15:04:52] <lrvick> becasue $.ajax lets me set custom request headers
[15:04:56] <Eviltwin> lrvick: Take a quick peek at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[15:04:58] <lrvick> which is exactly waht i need for the github api
[15:05:07] <lrvick> Eviltwin: I cant use that.
[15:05:07] <Eviltwin> They show you how to do the exact same thing with $.ajax
[15:05:13] <lrvick> oh?
[15:05:17] <Eviltwin> Yes...
[15:05:18] <Eviltwin> RTFM!
[15:06:37] <lrvick> ah yes but I also need to pass variables through to the callback function like i can with getJSON
[15:06:44] <lrvick> thats the aprt im fuzzy on
[15:06:46] <Eviltwin> ...
[15:06:51] <lrvick> having a external detached function
[15:06:56] <lrvick> im not sure how to do that
[15:07:14] <Eviltwin> Show me what you're doing with $.getJSON and why it doesn't work with $.ajax?
[15:07:52] <lrvick> mainly i just need to pasa jquery object to the function as an an argument, so the callback function can place its results in that object
[15:08:28] <lrvick> http://jsfiddle.net/t9wtJ/41/
[15:08:46] <lrvick> the getFile function is the one i need to use $.ajax with
[15:08:56] <lrvick> but i also need to make sure to pass "element" into the callback
[15:09:01] <lrvick> so it can put its results there
[15:10:25] <Eviltwin> Pass "element" into what callback
[15:10:32] <Eviltwin> And again, how is it any different than $.getJSON
[15:10:42] <lrvick> oh
[15:10:49] <lrvick> i suppose if i can create the sucess function in-line
[15:10:52] <lrvick> then that would work
[15:10:53] <Eviltwin> Yes...
[15:10:55] <smplstk> getJSON is just an extension of $.ajax
[15:10:56] <lrvick> if it accepts that
[15:10:59] <lrvick> well great
[15:11:00] <Eviltwin> ...
[15:11:01] <lrvick> problem solved
[15:11:04] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ lrvick
[15:11:05] <bot-t> lrvick, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[15:11:31] <lrvick> well i did not know that jquery would automatically create callback functions for me
[15:11:34] <lrvick> and abstract it all
[15:11:41] <Eviltwin> It...doesn't?
[15:11:52] <lrvick> nromally with raw jsonp, you have to have a torally detaced function , or something to handle creating references
[15:11:54] <Eviltwin> I don't understand the confusion
[15:12:01] <lrvick> detached*
[15:12:06] <Eviltwin> But I suspect it's due to a lack of an advanced understanding of JavaScript
[15:12:16] <Eviltwin> Usually happens when people dive into jQuery too soon
[15:12:26] <Eviltwin> Since jQuery uses a lot of advanced concepts
[15:12:43] <lrvick> Eviltwin: Ive written jsonp libraries for raw javascript from scratch
[15:12:56] <Eviltwin> OH, I think I understand how
[15:13:00] <lrvick> i just didnt know jquery would handle all the callback abstractions, and psuedo functionc reations
[15:13:01] <Eviltwin> You mean the ?callback=? bit
[15:13:02] <lrvick> which is a requirement
[15:13:16] <lrvick> Eviltwin: correct
[15:13:29] <lrvick> burdging the actual callback funciton name, to the sucess function
[15:13:31] <Eviltwin> It searches for the callback=? string and automatically replaces it with a unique function name in the window, yes
[15:13:45] <Eviltwin> Which then calls the success function
[15:13:51] <smplstk> you can use a function name in place of the ?, no?
[15:13:52] <lrvick> that requires jauery being smart enough to create function names on the fly, and point them abck to that sucess, and apss in any scropes via closrue
[15:13:56] <lrvick> apparently it CAN do that
[15:13:59] <lrvick> which saves mea  ton of work
[15:14:12] <Eviltwin> I would imagine you'd have run into this before if you wrote an abstract JSONP library before
[15:14:12] * lrvick cant type today
[15:14:15] <Eviltwin> But I guess not
[15:14:38] <lrvick> I have fun into it before.
[15:14:46] <lrvick> i was expecting to have to write all that logic myself
[15:14:51] <Eviltwin> Why? :P
[15:14:54] <lrvick> now i dont have to, because jquery does it.
[15:15:02] <lrvick> doing jsonp in raw js
[15:15:05] <lrvick> is a pain
[15:15:11] <Eviltwin> If you do it wrong
[15:15:22] <Eviltwin> I've coded abstract jsonp in less than 15 lines
[15:15:34] <lrvick> yeah thats 15 lines
[15:15:41] <lrvick> 15 liens == a pain
[15:15:45] <Eviltwin> ...
[15:15:49] <lrvick> compared to jauwer
[15:15:54] <lrvick> jquery*
[15:15:55] <Eviltwin> jQUery is 9200 lines
[15:16:10] <Eviltwin> I'll write the 15 lines if that's the only feature of jQuery I'm using :P
[15:16:10] <lrvick> yes, but its a library, which does thign slike that for me, so i can concentrate on higher level code.
[15:16:17] <lrvick> heh
[15:16:30] <Eviltwin> Correct, the whole point of libraries is making things easier and encapsulated
[15:16:44] <lrvick> https://github.com/Tawlk/hyve/blob/master/hyve.js#L251-263
[15:16:47] <smplstk> 9200+ (unminified)
[15:16:57] <lrvick> takes 13 lines for me with my method here
[15:17:10] <lrvick> but thats dirty code compared to jquery doing it for me, which it does
[15:17:12] <lrvick> so im happy
[15:17:14] <lrvick> anyway
[15:17:39] <Eviltwin> I didn't actually count with mine
[15:17:48] <lrvick> ive written plenty of js, i just apparently can't communicate well. :-P
[15:18:10] <Eviltwin> Correct :P
[15:19:42] <Eviltwin> Your jsonp function doesn't appear to do anything about the callback
[15:19:56] <Eviltwin> It just passes through the url
[15:22:02] <lrvick> Eviltwin: it does, becasue of its higher level function
[15:22:07] <lrvick> fetch
[15:23:08] <Eviltwin> So the jsonp function picks the callback name using the counter but isn't responsible for adding that to the URL?
[15:26:40] <lrvick> its already in the url at that point
[15:26:42] <lrvick> if im not mistaken
[15:26:47] * lrvick double checks
[15:27:30] <Eviltwin> Just peculiar to me that the logic that picks the callback name and the logic that adds the callback at that name seems to be separated in an odd way
[15:27:51] <Eviltwin> w/e
[15:27:55] <Eviltwin> jQuery does it better :P
[15:27:59] <lrvick> well counter is the same
[15:28:10] <lrvick> so i can already have it in the url at that point
[15:28:33] <lrvick> but regardless it serves my needs for this situation well.
[15:29:36] <lrvick> since I have to support a wide range of apis here, the replacement happens in the format function, before it actually gets inserted and called.
[15:29:40] <lrvick> no rason to format the url twice
[15:29:42] <lrvick> reason*
[15:29:50] <lrvick> but anyway
[15:29:54] <lrvick> it works.
[15:29:59] <lrvick> now mack to my jquery code...
[15:30:01] <lrvick> lol
[15:32:45] <lrvick> http://jsfiddle.net/t9wtJ/44/
[15:32:55] <lrvick> my Accept ehader is apparently not being sent properly
[15:33:06] <lrvick> or my code is wrong (more likely)
[15:36:26] <Eviltwin> There's a note about the jqxhr setRequestHeader
[15:36:28] <Eviltwin> Not sure if it applies
[15:36:28] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[15:39:51] <tfitts> does anyone here use history.js?
[15:39:51] <lrvick> i see
[15:40:07] <lrvick> thre is "headers" as of 1.5
[15:40:09] <lrvick> theats enater
[15:40:13] <lrvick> still does not work however...
[15:40:25] <lrvick> http://jsfiddle.net/t9wtJ/46/
[15:43:35] <Eviltwin> lrvick: Oh, ha ha ha
[15:43:42] <Eviltwin> How the hell would it work?
[15:43:48] <Eviltwin> It's JSONP
[15:44:02] <Eviltwin> It's not XHR
[15:48:27] <lrvick> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/t9wtJ/47/
[15:48:34] <lrvick> here im just using "headers" instead
[15:48:44] <lrvick> which according to the docs should be universal
[15:48:59] <Eviltwin> Do you know how JSONP works....
[15:49:07] <Eviltwin> You implied you did
[15:49:30] <lrvick> sure, it grabs the source file, sticks it into the dom
[15:49:32] <lrvick> calls it
[15:49:36] <lrvick> then a callback is run on the result
[15:50:09] <Eviltwin> Wait
[15:50:19] <Eviltwin> "it grabs the source file"
[15:50:20] <Eviltwin> How?
[15:50:44] <lrvick> well the browser does, after it is inserted into the dom
[15:50:57] <Eviltwin> It sets the src of a <script> tag
[15:51:06] <lrvick> right.
[15:51:11] <lrvick> i wonder if faking a contenttype would matter
[15:51:13] <Eviltwin> You don't get to set a method, you don't get to add headers
[15:51:17] <Eviltwin> ...
[15:51:18] <lrvick> i guess there IS no way to pass an Accent header
[15:51:19] <Eviltwin> How?
[15:51:24] <lrvick> Accept*
[15:51:35] <Eviltwin> There's no way to pass anything other than a URL to GET...
[15:51:44] <lrvick> which means i get to do this the PITA way, and decode the raw base64 data
[15:51:45] <lrvick> fail
[15:51:55] <Eviltwin> What's not working?
[15:52:10] <lrvick> Well see the github api only returns all content data as base64
[15:52:14] <lrvick> unless it gets a magic accept header
[15:52:18] <lrvick> and then it will send raw data
[15:52:40] <lrvick> buuut since it seem its not possibel to do that using jsonp
[15:52:50] <lrvick> i get to decode the base64 every.single.time
[15:52:58] * lrvick facepalms and lookins into base64 functions
[15:58:54] <tfitts> Eviltwin: have you ever used jquery.history or jquery.address?
[15:59:15] <Eviltwin> Don't really use plugins much
[16:31:18] <lrvick> Can anyone figure out why getFiles is being called even when i click on newly created children? http://jsfiddle.net/t9wtJ/93/
[16:33:34] <Eviltwin> Where does it get called
[16:34:13] <Eviltwin> Also, I suggest that instead of $("<li>"+value.path+"</li>"), you use $("<li>").text(value.path) or $("<li>",{text:value.path}) unless value.path is encoded with HTML entities
[16:34:34] <Eviltwin> Just to be sure
[16:34:55] <Eviltwin> You're probably bubbling
[16:34:58] <Eviltwin> Event bubbling
[16:35:09] <abjorn> BUBLAN
[16:35:25] <Eviltwin> Probably need some event.stopPropagation()s or return false's
[16:36:48] <lrvick> http://jsfiddle.net/t9wtJ/96/ updated
[16:36:57] <lrvick> but yeah its running it again once for each element added
[16:37:00] <lrvick> spamming everywhere
[16:37:01] <Eviltwin> You know you can run it without updating, right?
[16:37:02] <lrvick> hmmm
[16:37:25] <lrvick> Eviltwin: what do you mean?
[16:37:41] <Eviltwin> Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/t9wtJ/97/
[16:38:03] <lrvick> that works
[16:38:09] <lrvick> a simple return false?
[16:38:11] <lrvick> thats it?
[16:38:50] <Eviltwin> return false does the same as event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation()
[16:40:03] <lrvick> oh neat
[16:40:06] <lrvick> otherwise the bing keeps going
[16:40:08] <lrvick> good to know
[16:40:10] <lrvick> bind*
[16:40:13] <lrvick> thanks :-)
[17:17:14] <impulse9> hi, how do i iterate through elements with some id?
[17:20:27] <systemfault> impulse9: IDs are unique on a page.
[17:20:43] <systemfault> So by definition, your question doesn't make sense.
[17:21:47] <impulse9> how so
[17:22:23] <impulse9> i've got a bunch of buttons, and their id property is set to "button" which also corresponds to the css sheet
[17:22:32] <impulse9> i want to iterate over them
[17:22:39] <systemfault> Your markup is invalid then
[17:22:41] <systemfault> You canot.
[17:22:44] <systemfault> *cannot
[17:24:04] <impulse9> do some javascript they said
[17:24:07] <impulse9> it will be fun they said
[17:24:18] <systemfault> Javascript is really fun
[17:42:58] <dabear> impulse9: "*[id='bar']"
[17:43:11] <dabear> impulse9: and it is indeed quite slow
[17:47:54] <shaDy> whats a good language to pickup that will comment my front-end skills (html/css/js/jquery)?
[17:49:33] <systemfault> ?
[17:49:39] <systemfault> "comment"?
[17:50:24] <shaDy> lol wrong word
[17:50:41] <shaDy> compliment
[17:50:44] <shaDy> not comment
[17:51:18] <systemfault> Good question.. I wouldn't know since javascript is so much different than the traditional OO languages :/
[17:53:01] <dabear> php sadly
[17:53:06] <systemfault> Hmm.. no
[17:53:08] <dabear> python
[17:53:29] <systemfault> Ah, thought he wanted front-end stuff :/
[17:53:31] <dabear> .net and the mvc framework from microsoft
[17:53:36] <dabear> kinda depends on what you wanna do
[17:58:27] <shaDy> my front end stuff is at a pretty good level i wanna start focusing on back end
[17:58:36] <shaDy> i know my php/mysql but not that great
[17:59:12] <rzec> how to I get the html of an element including the selected elements html with jquery?
[17:59:30] <shaDy> what is the html element u are selecting?
[18:01:28] <dabear> rzec: google for "jquery outerhtml"
[18:02:47] <rzec> thanks dabear
[18:03:55] <rzec> any reason this functionality is not built into the core of jquery?
[18:16:21] <shaDy> what are all the web based channels?
[18:42:44] <dov23> Hi, if I define a function within function($){ function foo(){}}(jQuery);  will it be available throughout?
[18:44:01] <Chibby_> i heard you like functions...
[18:44:11] <Chibby_> i doubt it though
[18:44:20] <Chibby_> easier to test with a simple file than googling it probably
[18:44:35] <systemfault> dov23: Only if you "assign it" somewhere you can access it out of the closure.
[18:45:04] <dov23> systemfault: sorry for my ignorance, can you show me how to assign it?
[19:18:44] <fotoflo> i am binding a mouseenter handler to a class, and then appending another element of said class to the document -- after the append the new element doesn't have the handler bound
[19:18:46] <fotoflo> wtf?
[19:19:48] <fotoflo> if i then rebind to that class, elements of the class that were already on the page get bound twice‚Ä¶.   is there an elegant solution to this kind of problem?
[19:22:36] <systemfault> event delegation...
[19:25:06] <brylie> Can I put jQuery at the end of an HTML page without bad results?
[19:25:57] <brylie> I.e. I want to load jQuery from a CDN but do not want it to interfere with page loading.
[19:26:21] <tomato> it's prefered to load it at the end
[19:26:21] <systemfault> brylie: Optimally, all your javascript should be at the end of the body
[19:26:26] <systemfault> Just before </body>
[19:26:27] <_zoggy_> go look at the html5 boiler plate on how they do it
[19:26:38] <brylie> OK, thanks all!
[19:26:39] <_zoggy_> you can load from cdn / but also load from local as a failback with script
[19:26:53] <_zoggy_> http://html5boilerplate.com/
[19:27:33] <_zoggy_> read: http://html5boilerplate.com/docs/The-markup/
[19:27:48] <brylie> Ah, that looks great! I will study the markup. Thanks _zoggy_ :-)
[19:31:01] <fotoflo> systemfault:	$(".tag").delegate( ".tag", "mouseenter", function(){} );
[19:32:07] <systemfault> fotoflo:
[19:32:08] <systemfault> ?
[19:32:36] <nocturne7> "onload" does not work in chrome, what is the solution for this ?
[19:33:59] <fotoflo> systemfault: nothing appears to be happening
[19:34:14] <impulse9> how do i strip href="#" from the next() element
[19:34:17] <impulse9> i can't seem to get it working
[19:34:27] <systemfault> fotoflo: Because you're misusing it.
[19:34:38] <systemfault> fotoflo: Also.. if you use jQuery 1.7, use .on
[19:34:55] <impulse9> $('.myButton').next('a').removeAttr('href');
[19:34:59] <impulse9> i used this ^ but nothing happens
[19:35:20] <impulse9> the <a> is inside mybutton
[19:35:34] <systemfault> impulse9: Then why do you use .next?
[19:35:43] <systemfault> Instead of... .find ?
[19:35:44] <impulse9> i don't know
[19:35:47] <impulse9> i'm new to jquery
[19:37:00] <fotoflo> systemfault: ok i got .on() working but i have the same problem again: new elements aren't being bound
[19:37:16] <impulse9> systemfault, thanks
[19:37:38] <systemfault> fotoflo: Because you're using .on in "event handling mode"
[19:38:30] <systemfault> $('parentContainerSelectorHere').on('click', 'selectorHere', function() { handleEverythingHere});
[19:39:48] <fotoflo> systemfault: sweet
[19:40:32] <fotoflo> the documentation on that on() is rather long and hard to understand
[19:40:35] <fotoflo> thanks!
[19:40:59] <systemfault> You're welcome.
[19:42:53] <Anime> http://jsfiddle.net/76bw8/ - im trying to do exactly the same thing but on a real page, the fiddle works for elements added via js whilst the page example doesn't, is there anything im missing?
