[00:19:37] <Joric> hi there
[00:20:17] <Joric> did anyone try to get over the restricted domain policy in ajax? are there any public proxy servers or something
[00:23:26] <amh345> good evening.  im trying to get a spinner to function on my ajax request. so far i've got the spinner working.  but the thing i can't get to function is how to only make it appear if the request takes more than a couple of seconds to load.    i was trying setTimeout but i dont think im doing it correctly.  does anyone have a quick moment to have a peek? https://gist.github.com/2342105
[00:26:21] <pats_Toms> is there someone who can explane me how to use this? https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[01:00:54] <antipattern> .
[01:05:51] <wroos> Hi. Anybody know of any good, lightweight wysiwyg editor. I need it to produce valid xhtml, i need to create a custom upload/image gallery, so it has to be customable. Would be awsome if the code-mode has highlight support. Any suggestions?
[01:31:38] <natte|wrk> wroos: there is no such editor
[01:38:58] <badgerbrush> Hi, is this the right place to ask a newbie question regarding debugging a simple piece of jquery?
[01:44:35] <Munger> Hi. Using JQM, I want to implement a horizontal scrolling view which using Ajax will allow the user to pan through potentiallys a thousand or so columns without abusing the DOM. i.e. load up a few columns each side of the visible columns as they scroll. Basically it's a jukebox like interface. Are there any  plugins which do this kind of thing?
[01:45:02] <wroos> natte|wrk: How can you be so shure?
[01:46:34] <natte|wrk> wroos: well at least I haven't found one then :)
[01:46:46] <wroos> Okay. :)
[01:46:50] <natte|wrk> and I've looked quite a few times
[01:46:58] <wroos> Me too.
[01:47:47] <natte|wrk> but mainly the challenge is that to implement an editor that generated xhtml compliant code in all browsers is crazy
[01:48:20] <natte|wrk> I have done it once some time ago for a closed source project and don't want to do it again :)
[01:49:16] <raj> anyone familiar with history.js ?
[01:49:30] <raj> I'd like to detect a back/forward button press, and not sure how
[01:52:39] <cheesypoof20> That doesn't seem like it would be in the purview of javascript.
[01:52:53] <raj> why not?
[01:53:26] <badgerbrush> Can anyone give me some pointers as to why this doesnt work? http://pastebin.com/zjHDzvyc All it does in firefox is in the tab title it keeps spinning around saying "Connecting..."
[01:53:26] <cheesypoof20> If a browser allowed access to that information, it would be considered a security hole.
[01:53:49] <badgerbrush> Basically it uses the tumblr api to get the tags and then produces a crude tag cloud
[01:53:59] <badgerbrush> this is my first outing into javascript
[01:54:25] <raj> cheesypoof20, to tell when the back button was clicked?
[01:54:28] <raj> why is that a security hole?
[01:56:23] <badgerbrush> it does work in the sense that it produces my tag cloud but its the "Connecting..." thing I can't figure out
[02:02:15] <cheesypoof20> If my browser did that, I would consider it that. Maybe others have a different view. Clicking the back button does not result in a new http request, so I don't see why that information would be appropriate for javascript to know.
[02:02:53] <raj> cheesypoof20, cuz the hash/queryparameters of the page have changed when the back button is clicked
[02:03:12] <raj> so I need to make some resultant changes to the page, according to those query parameters
[02:03:32] <raj> currently, the page just sits there, even the query is showing a previous state
[02:03:45] <raj> even *though the
[02:04:17] <raj> i polling is ridiculous
[02:04:26] <raj> s/i//
[02:11:56] <cheesypoof20> I have an image replacement script that currently works on 'hover'. I would like to expand that to include 'focus' as well. I can get this to work, but I have to essentially duplicate the '.hover' code. Is there any way to combine these? http://jsfiddle.net/B4tun/
[02:13:01] <raj> there's no .inline-block ?
[02:13:26] <raj> or .picture-main or any other class
[02:13:59] <raj> holy crap, that's a css made star
[02:14:09] <cheesypoof20> I didnt feel it was necessary to make a full mockup.
[02:14:28] <raj> nicely done
[02:15:36] <raj> why not just pull out the function you're using in .hover
[02:15:38] <raj> name it
[02:15:40] <raj> and then use it twice?
[02:15:56] <raj> can you not use a named function with hover/focus?
[02:37:43] <Ashfame> Any tutorials on understanding jQuery plax plugin for parallaxing?
[02:50:54] <angelazou> hey guys, I'm having trouble getting a jquery plugin to work. this is the working example here http://jsfiddle.net/a3MKQ/
[02:51:07] <angelazou> and my not-working example here http://jsfiddle.net/9ZLp5/
[02:51:54] <angelazou> and not only is the script not working, the tabular format is also looking weird
[02:54:05] <angelazou> any ideas why an identical script wouldn't work?
[02:57:31] <angelazou> btw, I used yaml with the script
[02:59:51] <angelazou> anyone?
[03:31:49] <poppiez> anyone with jquery.form.js experience? I'm trying to send an array of values. I want to send areas[]=1&areas[]=2 so in beforeSerialize I do: beforeSerialize: function($form, options) { options.data.areas = [1, 2]; } but it gets formatted as areas=1,2
[03:35:11] <poppiez> I can see that jquery.form.js uses $.param, which should encode the URL properly
[03:37:44] <raj> if I add a class to some elements, but some of those elements already had that class, will it duplicate the class in the attributes of that element?
[04:03:18] <hendry> is it possible to load a 3rd party site in an iframe and manipulate its DOM some with Jquery?
[04:32:19] <Munger> So. I have a view which conceptually contains details of every item in a database table. As the user scrolls though the view, ajax queries populate the view with a subset of items surrounding the visible portion. I know from the outset how many records I have in total, so need to set up the scrollbar to indicate the amount of available records. Can I just set scrollWidth on the view?
[04:33:22] <Munger> (it will scroll horizontally)
[04:34:05] <nlogax> you can generate an extra element with the proper total height, can't set scrollWidth/Height afaik
[04:34:20] <nlogax> total width :)
[04:35:45] <Munger> Oh. so I can just create an invisible place holder dic or whatever at the right extreme of the view
[04:35:51] <Munger> *div
[05:14:05] <JavaLover> is anyone awak right now?
[05:17:08] <JCBK> could someone explain me why this doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/crGgv/
[05:18:13] <PavelloZ|home> JCBK: try alert(margin); after assigning it
[05:18:22] <PavelloZ|home> it should help :)
[05:19:29] <JCBK> PavelloZ|home: not sure if I understand what you mean, could you fork it and show it?
[05:19:50] <JCBK> or do you have a link to documentation on it? :)
[05:22:42] <PavelloZ|home> paste "alert(margin);" after creating margin variable
[05:22:47] <PavelloZ|home> in the next line
[05:22:54] <PavelloZ|home> its called alert driven debugging
[05:23:10] <PavelloZ|home> and you check if your variable has the value you wanted to
[05:23:29] <PavelloZ|home> i dont think forking fiddle is neccessary ;)
[05:24:02] <JavaLover> wtf is forking?
[05:25:43] <JCBK> hmm, it returns "undefined"
[05:26:36] <JavaLover> oh wow so people are up ok I have a question
[05:26:53] <JavaLover> i have a hover function...but a lot of times the function is getting stuck & not removing the hover
[05:27:00] <JavaLover> so I end up with multiple hovers displaying....suggestions?
[05:27:45] <JCBK> ah thanks, there was a space missing :)
[05:28:10] <PavelloZ|home> :)
[05:28:22] <Munger> I recently saw a site that was implementing an ajax driven infinite horizontal scrolling view, but I lost it. I'm sure it's an existing class/plugin
[05:28:44] <JavaLover> munger i've seen this site as well it's epic
[05:28:53] <JavaLover> i might have a bookmark...can you answer my question though?
[05:29:11] <JavaLover> what is a way to fix a broken hover function...that can sometimes be broken but sometimes works...
[05:30:17] <Munger> JavaLover, Sounds like you aren't handling an event when the mouse moves out quickly
[05:30:50] <JavaLover> well yeah...hows that possible though?
[05:31:08] <JavaLover>    $(".thecomment").hover(function() {
[05:31:08] <JavaLover>     $(this).find("div.desc").show("medium");
[05:31:08] <JavaLover>     },function(){
[05:31:08] <JavaLover>     $(this).find("div.desc").hide();
[05:31:08] <JavaLover>    });
[05:31:11] <JavaLover> srry srry sryr omg!
[05:33:16] <JavaLover> i have an idea...
[05:33:19] <Munger> JavaLover, have you checked the value of 'this' in FireBug?
[05:33:19] <PavelloZ|home> JavaLover: you can create a demo at jsfiddle.net
[05:34:23] <visof> hello
[05:34:48] <visof> how can i wrap any tag with a class
[05:34:50] <JavaLover> nope didn't work to put it into it's own variable
[05:35:08] <JavaLover> course i could add it to an array and then remove from the array
[05:35:11] <JavaLover> just sounds too complicated
[05:35:40] <JavaLover> pavello, i'd love to add to a jsfiddle....it's just  idk if i could get it to work on jsfiddle
[05:35:49] <visof> as example: if i have <div id="small">hello</div>, and want to wrap this to <div class="big"> <div id="small">hello</div> </div> ?
[05:36:22] <JavaLover> the problem is, i'm not getting the second part of my hover to work...
[05:36:34] <visof> please anyone help me
[05:37:47] <PavelloZ|home> JavaLover:
[05:37:57] <PavelloZ|home> if the show/hide is the only thing you want to do with the thing
[05:38:03] <PavelloZ|home> try just using toggle() function
[05:38:20] <JavaLover> well i like the animation part of it...but what's toggle()?
[05:38:25] <JavaLover> i'm kinda new to this whole jquery
[05:38:32] <PavelloZ|home> so check in docs ;)
[05:38:52] <visof> is there a standard way to make some div move in circle ?
[05:39:23] <JavaLover> wait so instead of target.show
[05:39:27] <JavaLover> i say target.toggle()?
[05:40:29] <PavelloZ|home> better, you can even fadeToggle, slideToggle and set the duration of animation
[05:42:34] <JavaLover> here are my findings
[05:42:39] <JavaLover> the toggle thing works completely
[05:42:53] <JavaLover> i haven't tride the fadeToggle or whatever though, but just as a test it does work
[05:42:57] <JavaLover> try'd*
[05:43:04] <JavaLover> wait how do you say try'd?
[05:43:25] <JavaLover> is try'd even a word?
[05:43:27] <PavelloZ|home> tried?
[05:43:38] <JavaLover> hahahhaha maybe
[05:43:41] <PavelloZ|home> you mean past tense of try ? :)
[05:43:45] <JavaLover> tried*  yeah
[05:43:49] <JavaLover> past tense of try lol
[05:43:51] <PavelloZ|home> yea, we got it
[05:44:21] <JavaLover> oh man & I always though my math skills would just make up for my english ones
[05:44:26] <JavaLover> thought*
[05:44:49] <JavaLover> but I do look like a retard sometimes just based on my english
[05:45:04] <PavelloZ|home> not really :)
[05:45:17] <PavelloZ|home> not everyone is lucky enough to be english native speaker
[05:47:12] <JavaLover> ok so when adding animation, i end up having it try to animate like 10 times
[05:47:31] <JavaLover> course i wasn't trying ur fadeToggle....so lemme try that
[05:48:16] <JavaLover> yeah see look if i click the button 10 times it'll toggle over & over even in the example
[05:48:31] <JavaLover> http://api.jquery.com/toggle/  just scroll down & click the button for animation toggle over & over
[05:48:39] <JavaLover> that's what i'm trying to stop..I don't want it to toggle a bunch of times
[05:49:11] <JavaLover> but i have a hover function so like 10 things to over on & then my issue is if the user hovers by waving mouse around...
[05:49:42] <PavelloZ|home> ok, make a fiddle ill try to help :)
[05:49:52] <ironmagma> Hi all, is it possible to be notified of a change in the document.location.hash value? For instance, a user types http://example.com/#blah into the address bar; the page is not reloaded, but it still changes the state of the object. Is there an event for this, or is polling the only way?
[05:50:28] <JavaLover> hmmmm
[05:50:45] <JavaLover> k 1 sec
[05:52:46] <JavaLover> http://jsfiddle.net/kRsse/ can you make it so when you click button 10 times animation finishes instantly with whatever boolean you had at that point in time?
[05:53:16] <JavaLover> so if true it'll just finish up displaying true...if false it'll hide, instead of doing animation OVER AND OVER AND OVER
[05:55:02] <rroelofs> visof: $(".small").wrap()  http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[05:57:17] <jeffsmykil> Can anyone tell me why #map isn't moving when #center is clicked?
[05:57:18] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/Z7p5r/25/
[05:57:27] <PavelloZ|home> JavaLover: i guess this is off the table? http://jsfiddle.net/u4WZR/
[05:57:29] <PavelloZ|home> ;)
[05:57:48] <JavaLover> well yeah lol
[05:57:52] <JavaLover> we still need animation
[05:58:00] <jeffsmykil> oh shit it is
[05:58:08] <JavaLover> course that is if we can't fix this the only solution I can think of
[05:58:42] <Hopsy> JavaLover: can you help me?
[05:58:49] <JavaLover> i can try
[05:59:03] <Hopsy> I want to make applications for my mobile
[05:59:04] <JavaLover> what's the issue hopsy?
[05:59:10] <JavaLover> what type of mobile?
[05:59:21] <Hopsy> and therefore I need to use java
[05:59:27] <JavaLover> not necessarily
[05:59:34] <JavaLover> if it's an iphone you need objective C
[05:59:52] <Hopsy> uhmm, is there not a program that can create for all platforms?
[05:59:57] <Hopsy> like adobe air?
[06:00:03] <JavaLover> actually there is
[06:00:09] <JavaLover> and adobe air is a good example of it...but
[06:00:17] <JavaLover> feedback from the entire community is basically
[06:00:21] <JavaLover> that those programs suck
[06:00:45] <Hopsy> hmm
[06:00:48] <JavaLover> so i recommend using the default sdks, so for Android it's the Android SDK and then for iphone it's the iphonesdk
[06:00:55] <JavaLover> and then porting for each device
[06:01:20] <JavaLover> it's just better, more high end...course it does limit you inw hat you're creating if you want it on iphone & android
[06:01:28] <Hopsy> are you familiar with this?
[06:01:39] <JavaLover> but from a business perspective I think ur only limited in the beginning, once you get the ball rolling you can either code it yourself or higher someone to do it for you
[06:01:50] <JavaLover> extremeley
[06:01:51] <JavaLover> it's all I do
[06:01:58] <Hopsy> ow lol
[06:01:58] <JavaLover> aside from this website
[06:02:01] <Hopsy> greatt
[06:02:13] <Hopsy> do you have a website?
[06:02:33] <JavaLover> i'm one of those "cool i'll make ur website" my website still sucks on the other hand type of coders
[06:02:48] <JavaLover> too busy grinding trying to make it
[06:02:51] <Hopsy> haha okay
[06:02:59] <JavaLover> i mean i do have one it features my double parked app here
[06:03:01] <JavaLover> belowzerosoft.com
[06:03:34] <JavaLover> it's also somewhat formatted for mobile lol
[06:03:36] <Hopsy> nice
[06:03:44] <JavaLover> but imma give it a revamp once I get my 3D game off the ground
[06:04:00] <Hopsy> how did you learn this JavaLover?
[06:04:05] <JavaLover> patience
[06:04:07] <PavelloZ|home> JavaLover: http://jsfiddle.net/u4WZR/5/
[06:04:15] <PavelloZ|home> i would do something like this
[06:04:15] <JavaLover> time & patience & passion & I went to school to learn java
[06:04:29] <JavaLover> ty pavello even if it does not work, ty so much
[06:04:37] <Hopsy> I tried once to install the java sdk for android
[06:04:40] <Hopsy> but that failed
[06:05:06] <Hopsy> So from that moment I didnt try it anymore
[06:05:20] <PavelloZ|home> ty for brining up a pretty unusual problem to me, now i know (better or worse) how to solve it ;)
[06:06:18] <Hopsy> JavaLover: which program do you use to write and test your code
[06:06:29] <JavaLover> WORKS!
[06:06:29] <Hopsy> eclipse is like hell for me
[06:06:52] <JavaLover> Hopsy, eclipse is a huge learning curve
[06:07:02] <JavaLover> but i advise you..although this goes against everything I stood for last year
[06:07:08] <JavaLover> to just get over the curve, it's worth it in the end
[06:07:35] <JavaLover> i recommend doing hello world tutorials over & over & over using eclipse
[06:07:40] <JavaLover> till you get it down to a basic science
[06:07:59] <JavaLover> I used to use the wtk sdk & compile & stuff I was a beast at it
[06:08:08] <JavaLover> had my own java based toolkit & even ported my app onto android
[06:08:22] <JavaLover> but like...at a certain point I just gave into the market
[06:08:41] <JavaLover> if everyone & their mom loves android then eff it, guess we gotta use eclipse & the android sdk
[06:09:06] <JavaLover> and I feel better now, after conforming to it
[06:09:24] <JCBK> PavelloZ|home: could you possibly take a look for me here? http://jcbk.me/site/ as far as I can see I've got the exact same setup as on the jsfiddle I linked before, but for some reason it returns 0px for $('.posts :nth-child(even)').css("margin-left"), even though it's set to 6%â€¦
[06:09:30] <JavaLover> atleast now I can actually ask questions in #android-dev they're still harsh....but atleast i'm on topic
[06:09:32] <JCBK> bear in mind, it's very much in a developing state :)
[06:09:49] <JavaLover> yeah & btw thx pavello, that works like a charm
[06:10:18] <Hopsy> JavaLover: One dayyy, I will be like you
[06:10:30] <PavelloZ|home> JavaLover: np :)
[06:11:37] <JavaLover> i do have a question though
[06:11:42] <JavaLover> why you got 3 ===
[06:11:55] <JavaLover> if(textVis === true){
[06:11:59] <JavaLover> is that an error or what?
[06:12:05] <Munger> What's a resonable maximum amount of emtyp divs in the DOM on an iPad?
[06:12:31] <Hopsy> 3 times =, means exact the same as
[06:12:39] <JavaLover> is that a joke?
[06:12:47] <nebiros> yes
[06:12:51] <JavaLover> hahaha
[06:13:01] <JavaLover> oh i believed him for a second 2 lol
[06:13:28] <Hopsy> lol
[06:15:12] <PavelloZ|home> JCBK: this is strange :)
[06:15:42] <JCBK> it is indeed!
[06:16:02] <Hopsy> JavaLover: A triple = sign is a comparison to see whether two variables / expresions / constants are equal AND have the same type - i.e. both are strings or both are integers.
[06:16:03] <PavelloZ|home> ps. you can do your show/hide span on hover stuff in css :P
[06:16:15] <Hopsy> A double = sign is a comparison and tests whether the variable / expression / constant to the left has the same value as the variable / expression / constant to the right.
[06:16:59] <Hopsy> textVis is a variable and true and boolean
[06:17:04] <JavaLover> ok so i changed from .hide() to .hide("fast"); and it works completely
[06:17:08] <JavaLover> i only have 1 question now
[06:17:10] <Hopsy> textVis is a variable and true a boolean *
[06:17:16] <JavaLover> is there a way to .hide faster?
[06:17:31] <Hopsy> fill in a number
[06:17:43] <JCBK> true, not supported in IE though
[06:17:45] <Hopsy> stands for miliseconds
[06:17:48] <Hopsy> ?hide
[06:17:48] <caniuse> Hopsy: .hide(): Hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[06:17:48] <JavaLover> what's the fastest although I will admit I love that it works now
[06:18:32] <Hopsy> bot-t changed his name to caniuse?
[06:18:34] <Deele> Hello, dealing with dialogs in UI. I want to store a local variable value within open: and use it within close: of beforeClose:
[06:19:01] <Hopsy> JavaLover: "Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate slower animations, not faster ones. The strings 'fast' and 'slow' can be supplied to indicate durations of 200 and 600 milliseconds, respectively."
[06:19:31] <JavaLover> awww so then
[06:19:36] <JavaLover> 1 is fastest
[06:19:37] <Deele> I try with "var myVar = 10" and "myVar = 10", both refuse, as "not being defined"
[06:19:43] <Hopsy> JavaLover: .hide(100) will make it go faster
[06:19:46] <JavaLover> kk
[06:19:51] <PavelloZ|home> JCBK: it works on static positioned elements, and doesnt work on your absolute positioned. may be this is the case
[06:19:52] <JavaLover> but i do like it even if not fast was just curious
[06:20:11] <JavaLover> i'm not sure why it works but it does
[06:20:21] <JavaLover> ya know what it probably was, without the boolean it probably was loading animation twice
[06:20:44] <JavaLover> idk..actually it might have just been the hide, either way i love it
[06:20:46] <PavelloZ|home> the boolean changes when animation finishes, because it changes on the animation callback
[06:20:50] <PavelloZ|home> whole philosophy :)
[06:21:02] <B_Lizzard> Hi, I'm attaching an event handler with 'on' with a delegated event, for a button that exists in a popup box, and is therefore not available when the page first loads.
[06:21:03] <JavaLover> yeah, it's pretty sick though jquery rocks
[06:21:11] <JavaLover> now then hopsy how can I help with ur mobile dev questions
[06:21:24] <B_Lizzard> The event bubbles the first time, but not any subsequent times
[06:21:29] <Hopsy> haha :p
[06:21:49] <Hopsy> how much times in a week are you on irc?
[06:22:05] <Hopsy> anddd, which channels can I find you
[06:22:09] <PavelloZ|home> B_Lizzard: $('#parent_element').on('event', 'button', function() { doMyStuuf() })
[06:22:31] <JCBK> PavelloZ:home but they're positioned relatively?
[06:22:42] <Hopsy> This week I got lots of tests
[06:22:49] <PavelloZ|home> if you want to  simulate live from older versions you have to specify which one is always in place and which one will show up :)
[06:22:51] <Hopsy> So I dont have too much time to spill
[06:23:09] <B_Lizzard> I'm doing $(document).on('change', '#parent-id .button-class', function() { blah });
[06:23:20] <B_Lizzard> Could it be because the parent id is, um, an id?
[06:23:56] <Hopsy> B_Lizzard: what is blah?
[06:24:10] <B_Lizzard> Well, whatever goes in that thing.
[06:24:11] <PavelloZ|home> looks good to me, but can you try observe something more specific than document? and especially change event is suspicious to me ;)
[06:24:11] <B_Lizzard> My code
[06:24:33] <JavaLover> i'm generally online like all the time while coding butttt
[06:24:36] <B_Lizzard> For brevity.
[06:24:40] <JavaLover> i'm not generally looking at irc
[06:24:44] <PavelloZ|home> " This event is limited to <input> elements, <textarea> boxes and <select> elements. "
[06:24:47] <PavelloZ|home> straight from docs
[06:24:52] <JavaLover> i only take peeks to talk about coding which happens around this time
[06:24:54] <PavelloZ|home> and thats why its suspicious
[06:24:57] <B_Lizzard> Yes, .button-class is an input
[06:25:10] <PavelloZ|home> oh ;)
[06:25:13] <Hopsy> okayy, I will spam you then next week :D
[06:25:15] <JavaLover> so if I were you i'd just ask me a butt load of questions right now
[06:25:28] <JavaLover> ok but i may or may not be here
[06:25:35] <B_Lizzard> Basically, a popup goes up, two inputs which take numbers generate an output
[06:25:37] <JavaLover> you can always email me belowzerosoft@gmail.com
[06:25:40] <PavelloZ|home> so you do something when input changes its value
[06:25:49] <JavaLover> and i'll see if I can arrange a meeting
[06:26:07] <PavelloZ|home> B_Lizzard: can you try making a little jsfiddle for the case?
[06:26:18] <B_Lizzard> OK, lemme see if it's the #id
[06:26:18] <JavaLover> or you can find me in the following: #gamedev #opengl #javascript ##ide #defocus
[06:26:24] <JavaLover> but the thing is out of all communication...this is least likely
[06:26:31] <JavaLover> you'll only catch me here if I have a bug
[06:26:36] <JavaLover> or if i'm bored lol
[06:26:37] <Hopsy> you could also send me a pm with your email address :p
[06:26:45] <JavaLover> belowzerosoft@gmail.com
[06:26:49] <JavaLover> it's my work email so
[06:26:51] <Hopsy> defocus lol
[06:27:00] <JavaLover> defocus is awesome I love it
[06:27:07] <JavaLover> it's a great way to at 4 a.m. find someone to talk to
[06:27:24] <JavaLover> and it's hard ya know i'm up late all my friends are sleeping
[06:28:06] <Hopsy> where are you from JavaLover?
[06:28:53] <JavaLover> berkeley CA
[06:29:12] <Hopsy> ooh nice
[06:29:14] <JavaLover> i need some food brb gonna put some meatballs on the stove
[06:29:19] <JavaLover> but before i go where you from?
[06:29:37] <Hopsy> The Netherlandss whooee~~
[06:29:42] <JavaLover> lol
[06:29:49] <JavaLover> i think i might have talked to you a while back
[06:29:57] <JavaLover> i've met a few euros on irc
[06:30:06] <JavaLover> srry if that's not the way to talk about ur culture lol
[06:30:09] <JavaLover> i'll brb
[06:30:13] <Hopsy> it could be
[06:31:28] <JCBK> PavelloZ|home: it definitely has something to do with the span inside the div. when I comment it out it returns the right margin value
[06:32:37] <PavelloZ|home> JCBK: yea, i have been checking the margin-left of the that span, and it was undefined all the time
[06:33:15] <JCBK> but that should really matter? as it's position is absolute
[06:33:18] <JavaLover> pavello ty so much btw, having this working is awesome
[06:33:30] <JCBK> and I'm only querying the margin-left of the parent div
[06:33:53] <PavelloZ|home> JavaLover: np, np :)
[06:34:02] <PavelloZ|home> i know the feeling
[06:34:21] <JCBK> okay I'm tracking it down now
[06:34:30] <JavaLover> i'm back btw hopsy
[06:34:36] <JavaLover> if you have any questions feel free to ask
[06:34:38] <B_Lizzard> Ugh, it was because jquery ui doesn't destroy previous dialogs
[06:34:40] <B_Lizzard> I think.
[06:34:43] <JCBK> I had set the margin of the span to 0 !important, to make sure it always has the same position as the parent div
[06:34:54] <JCBK> by disabling that it now picks up the right value
[06:35:33] <Hopsy> JavaLover: wb
[06:36:07] <Deele> does variable name, prefixed with "_" means something?
[06:36:49] <JCBK> with the margin 0 disabled, how do I make sure the span covers the exact same area as the parent div?
[06:37:09] <PavelloZ|home> Deele: afair it is a constructor
[06:38:17] <PavelloZ|home> ofcourse still it is a naming convention that someone can respect, and other dont
[06:38:38] <Deele> PavelloZ|home, if I see object with firebug, I see some variables prefixed with undersocre, and unfortunately, they seem to me as undefined from script side, while from console, I can view it's contents
[06:39:27] <JavaLover> pavello: lol http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[06:39:37] <JavaLover> shoulda just used this from the start lol
[06:40:43] <PavelloZ|home> JavaLover: but isnt it fun to do someting without plugin? sometimes its ugly kid in the corner, but usually its suited for the purpouse without any overhead ;)
[06:41:08] <JavaLover> yeah it was pretty epic & I do like the animation on it & I learned from it
[06:41:22] <JavaLover> i think imma try this intent though, kinda does it properly lol
[06:42:07] <quizme> hi
[06:42:10] <PavelloZ|home> it behaves weirdly imo :) but thats a matter of configuration i guess
[06:44:34] <B_Lizzard> Yeap, the Jquery UI dialogs weren't removed on close and it just updated the hidden windows.
[06:44:37] <B_Lizzard> DIE
[06:44:47] <quizme> when you trigger an event on a dom element it, the event seems to be accessible by $(parent_dom_element).on('custom_event', function() { });
[06:44:56] <quizme> is that what's meant by "bubbling up" ?
[06:49:17] <mrmax> Hi. Is there any pseudo selector for selecting HTML5 input types? For example, URL, tel, email, etc. beyond using attribute selectors?
[06:49:46] <mrmax> I've found blog posts about adding things like $(':search') to grab search inputs, but I'm just curious if there's something official
[06:50:21] <ajpiano> mrmax: you're better served using actual attribute selectors
[06:50:33] <ajpiano> which are supported by QSA and will be faster than any custom selector you add or use from jquery
[06:51:13] <k170> is this the right place to get help on the tablesorter plugin
[06:51:14] <k170> ?
[06:51:51] <mrmax> ajpiano: thanks
[06:53:33] <visof> hello
[06:54:02] <visof> var arr = $(.big).find("div") will give me array for all div in class big ?
[06:57:14] <johnkpaul> visof: you need quotes around big, and it's not _exactly_ an array, but yes, generally that's true
[07:00:31] <visof> johnkpaul: i'm trying to make a image gallery that have next and previous buttons and i want to make this photos moves from left to right
[07:01:12] <visof> it will have 10 photos as example but show 5 and 5 are invisible, like:
[07:01:37] <visof> photo1 photo2 photo3 photo4 photo5   next, prev
[07:01:47] <visof> click next should give me:
[07:01:52] <SirFunk> is there a way in javascript to use a variable to get a propety of an object like: a = {foo:'bar'} b='foo'. a.b ?
[07:02:01] <johnkpaul> visof: is there a question in there?
[07:02:06] <johnkpaul> SirFunk: yes, you can use bracket notation
[07:02:16] <SirFunk> a[b] doesn't seem to work
[07:02:22] <SirFunk> that was my first thought
[07:02:32] <johnkpaul> ?eval var obj={"hello":world"};var key = "hello";obj[key];
[07:02:33] <caniuse> johnkpaul: 'SyntaxError: Unexpected string'
[07:02:34] <visof> photo6 photo1 photo2 photo3 photo4 next,prev
[07:02:41] <johnkpaul> ?eval var obj={"hello":"world"};var key = "hello";obj[key];
[07:02:41] <caniuse> johnkpaul: 'world'
[07:02:42] <SirFunk> nevermind
[07:02:44] <SirFunk> i tested wrong :-P
[07:02:46] <SirFunk> thanks
[07:02:48] <johnkpaul> np
[07:03:16] <visof> next again : photo7 photo6 photo2 photo3 next,prev
[07:03:23] <visof> how can i do that ?
[07:03:32] <visof> please anyone help me to do that
[07:13:04] <SEJeff_work> How does one go about listing events attached to "scroll" and removing them?
[07:16:40] <PilotBob> Hey all... I'm not quite sure how to do this. I want to set focus to the first element on my page that has a class, but if that element is in a jQuery UI tab I need to select that tab also.
[07:16:52] <NoiseEee> SEJeff_work: .on() .off() with a little of ben almans debounce plugin
[07:17:07] <SEJeff_work> NoiseEee, Thanks
[07:17:26] <PilotBob> So, I guess I need someway to determine if the element found is contained in a div with the ui-tabs-panel class and if so select that tab, then set focus.
[07:18:31] <PilotBob> Something like?? $(".ui-input-validation-error"),closest(".ui-tab-panel") maybe, but not sure?
[07:21:29] <RPkS> johnkpaul: I found the problem yesterday, but I'm not exactly sure how to solve it.
[07:22:46] <johnkpaul> RPkS: great
[07:22:47] <johnkpaul> also
[07:22:50] <johnkpaul> stop changing your nick
[07:23:42] <RPkS> johnkpaul: When I borrowed some coding from the opencart forum to insert the jquery I neglected to notice that there was a div id mentioned carousel94 ...
[07:24:12] <johnkpaul> ah, there you go
[07:24:13] <RPkS> johnkpaul: Yes actually it wasn;t my intent to have the nicks gettting mixed up that way. LOL
[07:24:14] <johnkpaul> the dangers of copy and paste
[07:25:03] <RPkS> I'm not sure how to unravel the mess
[07:32:37] <aro> for some reason, i cannot get .on to work for me
[07:37:15] <varnie> hi
[07:37:18] <aro> hi
[07:37:26] <aro> i cant get it to bind to a newly created button
[07:37:35] <aro> i can only get it to work if i bind it after button has been created?
[07:37:38] <varnie> do you know why Chrome doesn't perform 'window.history.back()'?
[07:38:16] <aro> use history.back(1);
[07:38:26] <varnie> thanks, I will try.
[07:38:42] <aro> actually
[07:38:45] <aro> that will take you two back
[07:38:47] <aro> history.go(-1);
[07:38:48] <aro> use that
[07:39:10] <aro> make sure you return false after invoking that
[07:39:16] <aro> otherwise the normal action will take effect
[07:41:25] <johnkpaul> return false isn't exactly the same as event.preventDefault(), but yeah, you need to stop the normal action
[07:41:37] <johnkpaul> return false is event.preventDefault() _and_ event.stopPropagaion()
[07:42:02] <aro> return false in a handler will invoke event.preventDefault() / stopPropagation(); naturally.
[07:42:38] <aro> im 10 seconds away from never upgrading jquery again and always using .live()
[07:43:20] <johnkpaul> aro: what's the problem you're having?
[07:43:30] <varnie> strange, it  still doesn't work for me
[07:43:42] <aro> johnkpaul: its not delegating for some reason
[07:43:47] <johnkpaul> whenever I'm confused about .on() and want it to behave like .live() or .delegate() or .bind(), I just look at the source, all of those just delegate to .on() with different parameters
[07:44:19] <aro> when i do $('.selector').on('click', function() { }); it doesnt bind unless i call that after the item has been created
[07:44:32] <aro> ive read the API page about 15 times
[07:44:36] <johnkpaul> aro: yes, that's correct
[07:44:45] <johnkpaul> the parameters are incorrect
[07:44:54] <aro> what should the parameters be?
[07:44:57] <johnkpaul> if what you're trying to do is mimic live
[07:45:07] <aro> yeah
[07:45:18] <johnkpaul> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.fn.live
[07:45:35] <johnkpaul> it should be "click","selector",callback
[07:45:49] <aro> so what is the first part?
[07:46:01] <aro> $(...).on('click', selector, cb );
[07:46:09] <aro> the context
[07:46:20] <johnkpaul> document.body
[07:46:24] <johnkpaul> that's what live is doing implicitly
[07:46:29] <johnkpaul> hm, document, or document.body, I actually don't know
[07:46:32] <johnkpaul> but document.body will work
[07:46:42] <aro> in quotes or out?
[07:46:43] <johnkpaul> check the source for jQuery.context
[07:46:59] <johnkpaul> out, it's the actual object "document.body" isn't a valid css selector
[07:47:27] <aro> ok cool let me testthat
[07:47:51] <johnkpaul> great
[07:47:55] <aro> what do you guys think of ben alman
[07:47:56] <johnkpaul> whenever you have an API question, if the docs don't cover it or make sense to you, try reading the source
[07:48:02] <johnkpaul> you don't have to get too deep into it, but it'll help a lot
[07:48:04] <aro> the source?
[07:48:09] <johnkpaul> the jQuery source
[07:48:10] <aro> isnt it like chinese
[07:48:12] <johnkpaul> it's just javascript
[07:48:13] <johnkpaul> no
[07:48:16] <aro> at least it would be for me
[07:48:17] <johnkpaul> the unminified source
[07:48:21] <johnkpaul> I doubt that
[07:48:24] <johnkpaul> did you click the link I sent earlier
[07:48:31] <johnkpaul> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.fn.live is that chinese?
[07:48:39] <aro> perfect it works!
[07:48:40] <aro> :)
[07:48:46] <aro> i see how now, its a bubbling thing
[07:48:53] <johnkpaul> that what live is
[07:48:56] <aro> thats cool
[07:48:57] <aro> well
[07:49:01] <johnkpaul> that's how live works, it just didn't tell you it was adding it to document.body
[07:49:11] <aro> live attaches to the top level doesnt it?
[07:49:14] <johnkpaul> (or document, I still dont' remember) :)
[07:49:14] <aro> so it cant really bubble
[07:49:16] <aro> properly
[07:49:27] <johnkpaul> yes, that is an issue with live
[07:49:32] <johnkpaul> stopPropagation makes no sense anymore
[07:49:35] <johnkpaul> because it's already propagated
[07:49:42] <aro> yeah
[07:49:42] <aro> cool
[07:49:54] <Morteza_ipo> hi
[07:50:04] <Morteza_ipo> have problem on fadeIn
[07:50:40] <Morteza_ipo> I have a elemet with .hover
[07:50:47] <Hopsy> JavaLover: how is the coding going on?
[07:51:01] <Morteza_ipo> but when I have several mouse over
[07:51:02] <aro> hai hopsy
[07:51:09] <Morteza_ipo> it have several fadeIn and fadeOut
[07:51:15] <Morteza_ipo> how to solve it
[07:51:16] <Morteza_ipo> ?
[07:51:16] <Hopsy> btw what are you trying to make in jquery
[07:51:20] <Hopsy> hey aromasca_
[07:51:24] <Hopsy> aro *
[07:51:25] <varnie> aro, your suggestion didn't help :(
[07:51:33] <aro> varnie: what version of chrome?
[07:51:45] <varnie> 17
[07:51:54] <Hopsy> who is aro ? :O
[07:51:58] <aro> 17?
[07:52:07] <aro> hopsy u r in my notify list
[07:52:12] <varnie> the full version is: 17.0.963.79 (Developer Build 125985 Linux) Ubuntu 10.10
[07:52:17] <Hopsy> jessica?
[07:52:33] <aro> yeah
[07:52:34] <aro> :)
[07:52:35] <Hopsy> hmmm :P whyy?
[07:52:45] <Hopsy> I know I am famuos
[07:52:54] <Hopsy> and cool etc.
[07:53:54] <varnie> is it okay to have "<a href="#" onclick="myRedirectFunc();">link</a>" by the way?
[07:54:35] <aro> ...
[07:58:43] <mik__> Does anyone know how to load a CSS file?
[07:59:19] <mik__> I mean, it's possible to load a JS via jQuery.getScript(), but a CSS...?
[07:59:25] <aro> use lazyloading or something
[07:59:42] <aro> yepnope is a good one
[08:01:35] <mik__> Thanks, aro, I just downloaded yepnope
[08:01:50] <mik__> and I see it barely uses doc.createElement to create a <link rel=stylesheet
[08:02:02] <mik__> So I will follow this technique :D
[08:08:11] <mik__> mmm maybe the jQuery guys could add a function to their code anyway, I mean for future usage, perhaps any of them are here listening...?
[08:13:35] <Logikos> i made a auto tab rotator (goes through slides more or less automaticly with tab nav buttons) useing jquery, it works great except the client wants to be able to put youtube or other type vides in the 'tabs' ... the auto rotation stops when mouse is in the box, but if they put embed code there its an iframe, and if they click play then move there mouse out of the box, it will rotate while the
[08:13:35] <Logikos> vide is playing
[08:13:42] <Logikos> i'm wondering what the best way is to deal with that
[08:13:46] <Logikos> example site is here: http://granary.smartsitestesting.com/
[08:13:51] <Logikos> the 2nd tab is a youtube video
[08:15:20] <PilotBob> Well, I got it, this seems to work     $(".input-validation-error:first").each(function () {         var tabPanel = $(this).closest(".ui-tabs-panel");         if (tabPanel.length > 0) {             // element is in a tab             var tabRoot = $(this).closest(".ui-tabs")             $(tabRoot).tabs("select", tabPanel.attr("id"));             $(this).focus();         } else {             $(this).focus();         }     });
[08:16:15] <Hopsy> bored of being bored because being bored is boringg
[08:17:24] <SoulRaven> plase help me with something, i don't know to find out the heigh of hidden div
[08:18:18] <QueueQueue> Today I learned... Never set the src of image to blank if you're support IE7 in an asp.net application... Apparently it kills the session...??
[08:19:03] <Hopsy> lool

[08:24:26] <Deele> what does this mean?
[08:26:06] <rroelofs> QueueQueue: I don't know asp, but I do know that in ie < 8 the browser will make a request to / in the current directory if the src is empty.  If that page resets session info I can imagine you were pulling your hair out.  (I learned this the hard way in php)
[08:27:50] <rroelofs> I had read about that bug but didn't put 2 and 2 together until it bit me
[08:28:07] <bribroder> is this also the channel for jquery UI?
[08:28:35] <QueueQueue> That explains a lot rroelofs, and yes, I was pulling my hair out for a bit there xD
[08:30:25] <mik__> bribroder, yes, it is, just ask
[08:33:10] <WebDragon> the zoho signup form on jquery forums is broken in opera -- the scripting prevents one from tabbing into the email field,and additionally prevented me from clicking into the URL bar to copy the offending address of the iframe so I could paste it here
[08:33:20] <WebDragon> :/
[08:33:47] <SoulRaven> plase help me with something, i don't know to find out the height of hidden div
[08:34:47] <z0n3d> SoulRaven, $("divId").height ?
[08:35:38] <SoulRaven> yes, but is give me 0
[08:35:42] <BryanRuiz1> what happens if i use a function on an jquery object that has selected no elements
[08:35:44] <BryanRuiz1> ?
[08:36:03] <SoulRaven> i want to find out height of a div that is warp for jquery ui dialog
[08:36:18] <BryanRuiz1> (like do i need to check for elements before I executre a function)
[08:36:18] <BryanRuiz1> ?
[08:36:22] <SoulRaven> and i want to find out the hieght of that div before been used by .dialog()
[08:37:23] <z0n3d> SoulRaven, you should read about how .hide() works. The height of a hidden div is 0. So ask for the height before you hide it.
[08:40:07] <SoulRaven> z0n3d: the div is not hided by me, with that div works .dialog to put content inside

[09:01:43] <Parhs> hello guys
[09:02:07] <Parhs> is better to have all the code at external js files?
[09:02:47] <Parhs> or it is ok to call within <script> the functions i want that are sepicific for a page?

[09:05:28] <Hiall> Parhs: are they used cross pages?
[09:06:10] <WebDragon> where's my css3 multiple backgrounds? why doesn't .css("background") return both backgrounds (background-image returns only the gradient. background returns the empty string!) ? why doesn't blur restore the gradient ?
[09:06:31] <WebDragon> damn you runcible firefox!
[09:08:31] <Parhs> Hiall nop
[09:08:43] <Parhs> some things are used.
[09:08:52] <Hiall> Then it doesn't make much difference its done in separate files so it can be cached cross page
[09:08:55] <csurap> when I drag and drop an event outside the calendar it holds there, it does not revert back to the calendar.
[09:09:02] <Hiall> for nicety its good to put it outside html pages
[09:09:07] <Hiall> as thats meant to just be for html
[09:09:10] <Hiall> but up to you
[09:09:30] <Parhs> but if i want an efect on hover for contact page only
[09:09:48] <Parhs> then it isnt going to work at other pages..
[09:09:55] <Parhs> sometimes there is a conflict..
[09:10:01] <min|dvir|us-work> Hi, I have an iframe in an iframe. I'd like to replace the outer iframe with the inner iframe, so the inner iframe and all other contents of the outer iframe are removed. How?
[09:10:06] <Hiall> then you should be targeting better imo.
[09:10:06] <Onyx47> WebDragon, I gave up on that, browser support is in "when it feels like it" state it seems, I just use absolute positioned divs and transparent PNGs, ugly but works everywhere (except in IE6, but who cares?)
[09:10:13] <Parhs> like i have a google maps thing.. I should check whether the div for maps exists
[09:10:18] <Parhs> otherwise i get errors
[09:10:43] <Parhs> because it is included in every other page
[09:10:45] <WebDragon> Onyx47: ugh
[09:10:54] <Hiall> Parhs: why not only include the page on contact?
[09:10:55] <Onyx47> WebDragon, indeed
[09:11:07] <min|dvir|us-work> Anyone?
[09:11:14] <WebDragon> Onyx47: kinda difficult overlaying a magnifying glass on a gradient background otherwise
[09:11:23] <WebDragon> with inset box shadow instead of border
[09:11:38] <Parhs> Hiall you mean the javascript?
[09:11:45] <Hiall> yes
[09:11:58] <Hiall> sorry include the js :)
[09:12:06] <Parhs> then i am going to include a 1 line js file..
[09:12:08] <WebDragon> f(*&#$(*&$k this browser-war s*&#$t .. it's the 90's all over again
[09:12:15] <Hiall> as i said its up to you.
[09:12:22] <Parhs> i see..
[09:12:29] <Hiall> but for consistency html pages are for html.
[09:12:31] <Hiall> css for css
[09:12:33] <Parhs> ii am looking what is better for scaling
[09:12:33] <Hiall> js for js
[09:13:29] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to find out the height of a dialog before to be displayed?
[09:13:47] <SoulRaven> i want to autoresize the dialog height
[09:14:24] <Parhs> SoulRaven how to find the height when it isnt set?
[09:14:37] <Hiall> SoulRaven: set position absolute; top: -9999px; left: -9999px; get the height
[09:14:42] <Hiall> then remove the position absolute
[09:20:44] <SoulRaven> Hiall: but if i set the absolute position, top, left, and open the dialog, then find out the height, then remove the absolute, how i resize the dialog if is allready opened
[09:21:21] <Hiall> SoulRaven: you want the height based off the content?
[09:21:29] <SoulRaven> Hiall: yes
[09:21:47] <SoulRaven> the find the content height, then resize the dialog based on the content
[09:21:59] <SoulRaven> then display the dialog
[09:22:05] <Hiall> yea so find the height of the content with the dialog open
[09:22:12] <Hiall> else move the content to outside and find its height
[09:22:17] <Hiall> then open the dialog
[09:22:21] <Hiall> either way its the same outcome
[09:32:11] <catcher> I need to load some data into a div, and after it's loaded, refresh the page every 5 seconds. Doable?
[09:32:28] <catcher> Refresh the div actually, rather than the page.
[09:36:27] <rroelofs> catcher: sure.   We'll need to see code if you want a more specific answer.  Have you used jsfiddle before?
[09:36:41] <JCBK> can I use jQuery to set the size of a background image of a percentaged-sized element in IE?
[09:37:25] <rroelofs> JCBK: nope
[09:37:42] <JCBK> sucks. any other way to do it?
[09:38:05] <rroelofs> you will have to insert an img element into your html and use position absolute
[09:38:28] <rroelofs> bg images aren't sizable
[09:40:09] <kevindank> Hello
[09:40:32] <JCBK> well in IE9+ and all other browsers they are rroelofs
[09:42:18] <kevindank> Im not really great with JS, i can do a few simple functions, but in this case im modifying exisiting code.  http://pastebin.com/pgtrntP3   The php is on top and the JS is at the bottom.  What im trying to do is modify the JS so that when the box/gift is selected using #g_give_all_selected (an accordion or lightbox pops up/slides down and reveals the div #giftboxcontainer
[09:42:36] <kevindank> or rather #giftcontainer
[09:42:51] <kevindank> the live version of this is http://www.theplantencyclopedia.org/index.php?title=Special:GiveGift&user=A+Traviss+Corry
[09:43:42] <kevindank> right now when a gift is selected (single clicked/double clicked) a red border appears over the image, you have to scroll to the bottom and eneter a message, what i want to do is eliminate the need to scroll down...when you click the image the slider/accordion should appear
[09:44:03] <rroelofs> JCBK: true, but most sites have too large an ie share to use it yet.
[09:45:56] <rob_> hi
[09:46:10] <rob_> is it possible to change display: to hidden rather than none when using a jquery effect?
[09:46:13] <JCBK> rroelofs: I've given the image a class which sets it to display: none, and a conditional IE stylesheet which displays it normal
[09:46:16] <JCBK> thanks for the help anyway
[09:46:23] <rob_> so the element still takes up space..
[09:47:25] <kevindank> so i was thinking of doing like : http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[09:48:10] <kevindank> can anyone help me integrate this?
[09:50:29] <JCBK> kevindank: with the property css you can set it to whatever you want
[09:53:46] <JCBK> sorry, that was for rob_
[09:54:28] <JCBK> kevindank: have you tried following what it said on that page?
[09:56:35] <kevindank> im trying but i just dont understand it clear enough
[09:58:17] <kevindank> so the functionality i think would be best is to have .g-give-all-selected display the contents of #giftcontainer somehow
[09:58:39] <mYrAn> Helli!
[09:59:06] <mYrAn> o.. How can i make this work with fieldsets added after document load? http://pastebin.com/xWeqcrzq
[09:59:23] <mYrAn> right now it doesnt affect them :(
[10:00:10] <smallcapsdude> ajpiano: hi
[10:00:47] <smallcapsdude> ajpiano: random question: have you ever created dotted lines in google maps api v3?
[10:06:13] <Deele> when I'm looping over .children(), how to get element name?
[10:06:47] <mYrAn> anyone?
[10:07:28] <Deele> mYrAn ?
[10:08:46] <Jon47> Deele $parent.children().each(function(index, Element){ Element.getAttribute('name') });
[10:09:13] <biberao> hi
[10:09:26] <biberao> anyone watched nettuts jquery tut?
[10:09:27] <Deele> Jon47, element name is not an attribute
[10:09:34] <aclockworkpeter> hey guys, so I have this json string:
[10:09:35] <aclockworkpeter> {"d":[{"__type":"AJAXService.QuoteDTO:#SplendidCRM.WS","<Quote_Number>k__BackingField":"120041","<Quote_Subject>k__BackingField":"2-MASTER-PLANT-P-EXP"}]}
[10:09:57] <aclockworkpeter> how do I reference it within a success block of a jQuery ajax call?
[10:10:13] <Deele> Jon47, I mean something more like $(this)[0].localName
[10:10:20] <aclockworkpeter> success: function (data) { ??? }
[10:10:20] <mYrAn> yes Deele?
[10:10:21] <Jon47> Deele, if you've got an html element, use getAttribute('name'), if you've got a jquery object, use .attr('name')
[10:10:37] <Jon47> if you get an error with that, show me a fiddle and i'll fix it for you
[10:11:13] <Deele> Jon47, <input name="myInput"> -> $(this).attr('name') = myInput  -> $(this)[0].localName = input
[10:12:03] <varnie> Hi.
[10:12:24] <Jon47> Deele https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Document_Object_Model_(DOM)/Node.localName
[10:12:30] <Jon47> localName is not what you're asking about, I believe
[10:12:42] <mYrAn> How can i make this work with fieldsets added after document load? http://pastebin.com/xWeqcrzq
[10:12:58] <Deele> Jon47, I need "input", considering example I gave
[10:13:12] <varnie> when we do $("#someId").click(functio(){ .window.location.href = 'http://some.new.url'; } )  does it really change the initial href url?
[10:13:47] <varnie> in other words, I would like to change a href's url on thy fly when it is clicking
[10:13:58] <varnie> the*
[10:14:00] <Jon47> Deele, use .tagName property then
[10:14:32] <Deele> Jon47, thanks!
[10:14:54] <Deele> Jon47++
[10:17:56] <mYrAn> does anyone know how to fix my problem? :(
[10:18:21] <imsky> i can do it for a reasonable fee
[10:20:17] <mYrAn> oh, does it require that much fixing? thought i was looking at adding a .live() in some way :(
[10:20:29] <imsky> let me take a look
[10:20:37] <kevindank> im trying to alter http://pastebin.com/jPQGPpVs  so that when .give-all-selected is chosen it reveals another div similar to functionality seen http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5210033/show-div-on-hover-with-only-css
[10:21:04] <imsky> mYrAn: you should rewrite it using .on and event delegation
[10:21:33] <BryanRuiz1> there is an onChange="stuff" on a select drop down, how do i trigger this method using jQuery..  it seems like jQuery's trigger('change') doesnt fire it
[10:22:38] <mYrAn> imsky: could you refer me to the codex, im a beginner at jquery :(
[10:23:07] <imsky> mYrAn: that's why i'm offering to do it for a fee :) saves you time
[10:23:11] <imsky> anyhow if bot-t is enabled
[10:23:12] <sphinxxx> BryanRuiz1: just put your code in a function, and call the function
[10:23:13] <imsky> ?on @ mYrAn
[10:23:13] <caniuse> mYrAn: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:23:34] <BryanRuiz1> sphinxxx: not my code, wanted to keep from modifying it
[10:24:21] <BryanRuiz1> how do you access an element from something that is wrapped by jQuery
[10:24:22] <BryanRuiz1> [0]?
[10:24:28] <imsky> yeap
[10:24:32] <BryanRuiz1> thanks
[10:27:40] <yo> lj;/l;/jl;o;p
[10:28:43] <imsky> did you try to say lol
[10:28:45] <imsky> and fail?
[10:28:59] <mYrAn> imsky: is there some way of "reloading" the document ready?
[10:29:13] <imsky> hmm sure
[10:29:40] <aarobc_work> Hello, how do I call a function only after an .each() operation is entirely finished?
[10:29:42] <imsky> if you bind the .ready to a function, you can call it later with the same jquery context
[10:32:30] <mYrAn> imsky: i dont really follow :(
[10:33:19] <aarobc_work> So... anybody? calling a function when each() is done?
[10:33:37] <ryanneufeld> I'm trying to find a guide for doing cross domain posting with jquery in an iframe. Does any one have any suggestions?
[10:33:51] <ryanneufeld> ?when @ aarobc_work
[10:34:28] <imsky> mYrAn: sorry bud, i'm busy. if you would like private help, message me
[10:35:13] <mYrAn> okay, thanks anyways imsky!
[10:35:17] <aarobc_work> ryanneufeld: after the .each() operation is done. if I just put it after it in the code, it'll jump over it and call the function before the each() is done processing, and I don't want that to happen.
[10:37:55] <bribroder> join #sass
[10:44:34] <rroelofs> aarobc_work: .each isn't async by default is it?  are you doing an ajax call inside your each?
[10:44:36] <mYrAn> imsky: i fixed it by removing the .each() in front...
[10:45:17] <imsky> mYrAn: that works for fieldsets added after .ready?
[10:46:19] <mYrAn> i rewrote it using .live() and removed the foreach fieldset!
[10:47:19] <imsky> yeah that works too
[10:47:22] <imsky> good job buddy
[10:47:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, I have an event handler on a link with a certain ID: new html gets added to the page.
[10:48:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> now in that new html, another event handler should be added
[10:48:06] <ecky--ptang-zoob> how can one do that?
[10:48:19] <gnarf> aarobc_work: each is a synchronus operation - if you are asking about how to do something after a bunch of async operations you are doing in your each, ?see $.when
[10:48:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> how can you add a handler to generated html code
[10:48:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ?
[10:49:18] <mYrAn> thank you for the help!
[10:51:02] <rroelofs> ecky--ptang-zoob: the same way you do for server generated html.
[10:51:37] <int_64`> Hello.  Is it possible to simulate a download, just on the client side?  I want to dynamically generate a CSV file from a table on a webpage. Just using Javascript/Jquery
[10:53:36] <imsky> yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyno
[10:54:03] <Noeble> question: Iam looping trough a jsonget, appending a TR tags to a table. Works fine. Though I would like to make a zebra table. How can I mange to do this?
[10:54:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> rroelofs: where should this new code be added then?
[10:54:24] <imsky> Noeble: $("tr:even").addClass("zebra")
[10:55:07] <Noeble> imsky: hmm
[10:55:38] <ecky--ptang-zoob> imsky = ivanM?
[10:55:40] <int_64`> ok, I figured out a way...Its ugly :) Ill generate it, then upload it to the server as a temporary file, then do a window.location="" to download it L:P
[10:55:47] <SoulRaven> i have this snippet, http://jsfiddle.net/rGLAk/
[10:55:58] <imsky> Noeble: humm
[10:56:01] <imsky> ecky--ptang-zoob: who are you
[10:56:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> saw your posts on pxleyes
[10:56:19] <SoulRaven> ahy ideea way the innerDivHeight is not init right, even if the var is populated right?
[10:56:19] <imsky> oh cool
[10:56:23] <imsky> yeah it's me buddy
[10:56:28] <rroelofs> ecky--ptang-zoob: that depends: the simplest approach is to add the .on() call to the chain that created the element. or just after it is inserted into the doc, but if you are adding a lot of them it might be better to use the .live .on sysntax and attach it to the parent
[10:56:30] <Noeble> imsky: http://dpaste.com/729130/   , this is my code
[10:56:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> rroelofs, i'll look into those functions, never heard of them, thx
[10:57:38] <rroelofs> ecky--ptang-zoob: .live is deprecated so whether you use .live or .on depends on which version of jquery you are using
[10:57:48] <SoulRaven> i have this snippet, http://jsfiddle.net/rGLAk/
[10:57:49] <SoulRaven> ahy ideea way the innerDivHeight is not init right, even if the var is populated right?
[10:57:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> i have the latest version
[10:58:11] <SoulRaven> i mean the height parameter in dialog
[10:58:13] <rroelofs> ?.on @ ecky--ptang-zoob
[10:58:35] <rroelofs> ecky--ptang-zoob: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:58:36] <imsky> ?on @ ecky--ptang-zoob
[10:58:37] <caniuse> ecky--ptang-zoob: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:58:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> what's the difference between on() and click()
[10:58:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ?
[10:58:49] <imsky> huge difference
[10:58:56] <imsky> like...as big as the moon
[10:59:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yeah looks like it
[10:59:37] <gehsekky> the moon looks rather small actually
[10:59:42] <rroelofs> ecky--ptang-zoob: but it is very important to learn how to use .on
[10:59:45] <gehsekky> it's only the size of a nickel
[11:00:10] <imsky> gehsekky: my heliocentric model of the solar system, lemme show you it
[11:00:19] <gehsekky> haha
[11:01:37] <imsky> ecky--ptang-zoob: man pxleyes brings me back
[11:01:44] <imsky> i wrote a post in 2010 about css frameworks
[11:01:50] <imsky> big players at the time: xcss, sass, and less
[11:02:06] <imsky> never would have guessed less would make it
[11:02:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes i read that post
[11:02:34] <Noeble> imsky: could yuo perhaps show how I can add the zebra tables with addClass to my snippet?
[11:02:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> why don't you write for pxleyes anymore?
[11:03:13] <imsky> ecky--ptang-zoob: different projects developed and the constant pressure to write blog posts is pretty time-consuming
[11:03:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ah ok
[11:03:38] <imsky> the guy who runs pxleyes is a pretty cool dude though
[11:04:29] <imsky> Noeble: after the $.each, just add $searchtable_container.find("tr:even").addClass("zebra")
[11:04:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I need to do an ajax call in the newly generated code
[11:04:59] <sandbags> I have a question about keypress() handlers. If I call event.stopPropagation() should that be enough to prevent anything else seeing that particular keypress?
[11:05:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> can that be done with that on() function?
[11:05:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> confusing
[11:05:34] <imsky> mmmm yep
[11:05:42] <zatamine> hello
[11:05:51] <imsky> sandbags: yes
[11:06:01] <sandbags> imsky: hrnn... this is what i thought
[11:06:13] <sandbags> this is the code: https://gist.github.com/5d4205c448d131907cd0
[11:06:36] <sandbags> i can't see how i can have screwed it up, but just in case ...
[11:09:03] <Zneo> hello
[11:09:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> So when i click this link, something new html gets generated, can't I just output jquery code in that new html?

[11:10:12] <Zneo> how to use serialize for send data in Form using send
[11:14:12] <alxm> I am trying to up do a bit of simple math on td, but I am getting it slightly wrong I think...can someone help? jsfiddle.net/E92HT
[11:16:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> imsky?
[11:16:14] <Noeble> imsky: it worked! almost.. it wont add a class to the very last row.. any idea why that is the case?
[11:16:19] <imsky> ecky--ptang-zoob: how's it goin
[11:16:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> won't this work: $("test").html("<script>AJAX STUFF</script>")
[11:16:28] <imsky> Noeble: maybe because the last row isn't even
[11:16:40] <Noeble> imsky: I added both even and odd
[11:16:45] <Noeble> imsky: should be either, or?
[11:16:46] <imsky> lol why would you inject a script tag ecky--ptang-zoob
[11:16:54] <imsky> Noeble: uhhhh just even or odd
[11:17:45] <Noeble> imsky: yea.. added two different of greys to themm.. works.. cept the last row.. that one becomes white
[11:18:06] <imsky> Noeble: lol let me see your js
[11:18:15] <imsky> i think the only time adults think like children
[11:18:19] <imsky> is when they're learning a new api
[11:18:23] <blindMoe> hehe
[11:18:38] <blindMoe> I am trying to learn a new one right now that has 0 documentation
[11:18:46] <imsky> TRY ALL THE THINGS
[11:18:49] <imsky> i heard that works
[11:18:55] <blindMoe> hehe that is seriously how it has been
[11:18:59] <alxm> anyone have any ideas on the code I pasted?
[11:18:59] <blindMoe> almost done though... finally
[11:19:05] <Noeble> imsky: http://dpaste.com/729145/
[11:19:22] <imsky> Noeble: why did you put that into the $.each?
[11:19:35] <imsky> also you don't need to specify an .oddrow class
[11:19:36] <Noeble> imsky: cuz u told me to?
[11:19:39] <imsky> just make that the usual css
[11:19:51] <imsky> Noeble: no. "after the $.each, just add $searchtable_container.find("tr:even").addClass("zebra")"
[11:19:54] <imsky> notice the after
[11:21:09] <Noeble> imsky: got it.. and its fixed. ty.
[11:21:13] <imsky> np bud
[11:21:38] <Phoenixz> .empty() would unconditionally remove all child elements and texts from a <div>, correct? Right now, I have a div with content, a console.log($(thatdiv)); before and after the .empty() gives me equal results.. What might be causing this?
[11:22:12] <imsky> because when you run .empty(), it returns $(thatdiv)
[11:22:15] <imsky> that's what makes chains work
[11:24:24] <alxm> any ideas why this isn't workin? http://jsfiddle.net/E92HT
[11:25:14] <Phoenixz> imsky: well, actually I do console.log($('.classname'));... then  $('.classname').empty(); then console.log($('.classname')); again... And both console.log show the same, that the div contains data.. After the .empty() it should be.. well, empty, no?
[11:25:29] <imsky> oh i see
[11:25:38] <alexr2> alxm, for one, you have no variable td.upc :-P
[11:25:39] <alxm> besides the missing quotes
[11:25:41] <alxm> :D
[11:25:50] <imsky> Phoenixz: try running the .log after .empty, not while
[11:25:58] <alxm> alexr2: yea - I fixed the missing quotes...
[11:26:49] <Phoenixz> imsky: eh, I run the .log before and after... not during (how would I even to dthat?)
[11:26:52] <newellista> alxm: and if you are trying to set the value of $(this).text(), it should actually be  something like: $(this).text('new text');
[11:27:04] <imsky> Phoenixz: when you run .log($().empty()) that's while
[11:27:20] <newellista> alxm: click on the JSLint button at the top of jsfiddle, and it will point you to errors...
[11:27:21] <alxm> newellista: cool - will try that...thanks!
[11:27:31] <Phoenixz> imsky: Ah, well, I don't do that.. :) I actually do one before, then the empty(), then again .log
[11:27:44] <imsky> Phoenixz: you're messing something up somewhere
[11:29:26] <lmao25> I'm having trouble getting a variable to fine, line 74.. what am i doing wrong? http://pastie.org/3757105
[11:29:32] <lmao25> define*
[11:29:50] <Phoenixz> Actually, the real problem starts after that, when I do an $('.classname').append(content); right after that, (where content has HTML data) I get a "non_object_property_load" exception, which makes even less sense because all data is okay..
[11:30:08] <Phoenixz> imsky: obviously, somehting is wrong somewhere..
[11:30:09] <imsky> aw jeez
[11:30:11] <imsky> yes
[11:31:01] <Phoenixz> Anybody here who has had problems with "debugger;" suddenly not stoppiog in the debugger console in chrome?
[11:32:35] <alex-> Anyone familiar with thickbox ?
[11:32:49] <alex-> I try to modify the text of 'close or Esc Key'
[11:32:51] <alex-> To translate it into my native language
[11:32:56] <nocturnal__> is anyone having trouble using jquery datepicker in a dialog
[11:33:12] <nocturnal__> when I click on a date, it spits out an error
[11:33:17] <nocturnal__> day*
[11:34:02] <Phoenixz> nocturnal__: it would help to know what error, etc...
[11:35:13] <alex-> I somehow need to get the name of the image that the user is showing
[11:35:45] <nocturnal__> Phoenixz, it shows this  "f is undefined anonymous()includ...oken=-1 (line 530) onclick(event=click clientX=839, clientY=259)"
[11:36:11] <nocturnal__> It does not do this when I do not use it inside a dialog
[11:36:31] <nocturnal__> I am using jquery UI dialog
[11:38:15] <jonathancutrell> Hey folks
[11:38:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> can the click() function be used in another click() function?
[11:38:26] <jonathancutrell> quick question. Anyone ever use query transit?
[11:38:42] <jonathancutrell> ecky--ptang-zoob: yes, but what are you trying to do?
[11:38:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> well
[11:39:07] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I  have a link: this link generated a textarea and a submit button
[11:39:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> generates*
[11:39:21] <jonathancutrell> right on.
[11:39:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and on this submit button should be a handler to submit the stuff in the textarea
[11:39:35] <jonathancutrell> (That was supposed to be jQuery transit rather than query transit...)
[11:39:48] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so I wanna know how to add a click handler to generated html code
[11:39:49] <jonathancutrell> Alrighty
[11:39:53] <jonathancutrell> ah.
[11:39:55] <jonathancutrell> just use .on
[11:40:07] <jonathancutrell> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:40:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yeah i'm trying
[11:40:24] <jonathancutrell> it handles newly generated code by attaching your events above the dom.
[11:40:31] <jonathancutrell> excuse me - higher up the dom.
[11:40:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> this is how I make the textare: $('txtarea_' + id).html(replyhtml);
[11:40:43] <johnkpaul> :) I was just going to ask ou waht above the dom was jonathancutrell
[11:40:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so i should add on() after that html thing?
[11:41:00] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: (it made sense in my head!)
[11:41:12] <jonathancutrell> ecky--ptang-zoob: no, you can add your event handlers anywhere.
[11:41:33] <ecky--ptang-zoob> don't get it... this is all new to me
[11:41:42] <jonathancutrell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Ok, look at it this way
[11:41:47] <jonathancutrell> ecky--ptang-zoob: say you have a bucket
[11:41:53] <jonathancutrell> and inside this bucket are 4 mice.
[11:42:05] <alex-> Anyone can help me with thickbox
[11:42:06] <alex-> ?
[11:42:14] <jonathancutrell> alex-:  nope.
[11:42:16] <ParanoidGal> Anyone on a Mac able to do me a few checks in Safari / Firefox?
[11:42:28] <jonathancutrell> ecky--ptang-zoob: You want something to happen when you touch a mouse inside the bucket.
[11:42:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes! :)
[11:42:40] <jonathancutrell> ecky--ptang-zoob: So you drop in another mouse
[11:42:49] <brianloveswords> ParanoidGal: sure, what do you need checked?
[11:42:53] <jonathancutrell> ecky--ptang-zoob: the thing that matters is that it's in the bucket, right?
[11:43:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yup
[11:43:40] <jonathancutrell> alex-:  (sorry - not harshly, but thick box is a little old school. :)  gonna be difficult to find help on that, but I'm sure if the problem is simple, someone could probably take a few minutes and help. Ask! :) )
[11:43:48] <jonathancutrell> ecky--ptang-zoob: so, when you do .on,
[11:44:01] <jonathancutrell> ecky--ptang-zoob: basically the dom is the bucket,
[11:44:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes, got that :)
[11:44:09] <jonathancutrell> ecky--ptang-zoob: and the elements in the dom are the mice.
[11:44:39] <jonathancutrell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Okay, so you just do this: $(element).on("click", function(e){ //e is the event; e.target is the element the event happened on. });
[11:44:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but what is the difference between: $("#dataTable tbody").on("click" and $("#dataTable tbody").click()
[11:44:53] <alxm> I updated my code and it still isn't doing what I want...the syntax comes out ok - http://jsfiddle.net/E92HT/2/
[11:45:25] <jonathancutrell> I'm actually not sure if jQuery switched the functionality of .click(), but it used to be that .click didn't support newly added elements, as it created event bindings when the dom loads and the script runs.
[11:45:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ic
[11:45:48] <alexr2> alxm, put in some of the html code in as well... are you sure it's even capturing it?
[11:45:51] <jonathancutrell> however, .on("click") essentially is the smarter (newer) option anyway.
[11:45:59] <alxm> alexr2: ok...one sec
[11:46:49] <jonathancutrell> So here's what I'm working on - I need to stop the .transition() in a similar fashion to .stop(), but I've never worked with the plugin beforeâ€¦ http://jsfiddle.net/jcutrell/GsNJK/3/ Any ideas?
[11:46:56] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: .on() is now the way to handle all event handler binding
[11:47:06] <johnkpaul> I'm pretty sure that .click delegates to .bind() which delegates to .on()
[11:47:12] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: Right - .click is still in the docs tho.
[11:47:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> aah ok
[11:47:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> i always used click
[11:47:25] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: but recommendation is to use .on
[11:47:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> hope this won't cause any problems with future versions
[11:47:32] <johnkpaul> yeah, jonathancutrell, click isn't going anwyhere
[11:47:35] <jonathancutrell> ecky--ptang-zoob: It will. One day.
[11:47:37] <johnkpaul> .live and .delegate are deprcated
[11:47:39] <alxm> alexr2: http://jsfiddle.net/E92HT/3/ - it is in a django template...
[11:47:43] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: ah ok.
[11:48:05] <alexr2> eek... jquery 1.3.2?
[11:48:09] <alxm> I know. sorry
[11:48:11] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: any chance you'd take a look at my little particle explosion? :) http://jsfiddle.net/jcutrell/GsNJK/3/
[11:48:12] <alex-> jonathancutrell: I need (somehow) to get the name of an image being showed in Thickbox. The name should be stored using Javascript
[11:48:20] <alxm> I am just hacking on an old project
[11:48:24] <alxm> adding just a bit of functionality...
[11:48:29] <jonathancutrell> ok - show me some code. :)
[11:48:37] <alex-> jonathancutrell: self.opener.document.forms[0].image.value = this.value;
[11:48:46] <alxm> alos, phantom </li> removed
[11:48:49] <jonathancutrell> alex-:  in a paste. or people will get belligerent.
[11:48:49] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: pretty cool
[11:49:03] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: It'll be cooler when I can make it stop on demand.
[11:49:08] <johnkpaul> did you have a question, or just showing off? because the showing off worked :)
[11:49:20] <alex-> jonathancutrell: http://pastebin.com/7jGjiRE4
[11:49:23] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: Haha. I don't show off. I constantly have problems. Haha :)
[11:49:36] <alexr2> alxm, what is in the dom in that .upc td when you run it on the website?
[11:49:36] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: d3 might be able to give you some of this stuff out of the box
[11:49:42] <johnkpaul> but I don't know anything about jquerytransite
[11:49:45] <alexr2> comment out your loop and text replace
[11:49:56] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: yeah - that makes sense. I think that's all canvas tho, right?
[11:50:13] <ximarin_> hi all question: I have  a var and and a .post-call. var bla; $.post("file.php", { do:stuff}, function(data){ bla = data; }); but data does not get assigned to bla, I think because of the scope. How can I get bla to take the value of the callback?
[11:50:22] <jonathancutrell> alex-: Can you put your whole js doc in there so I can see a bit more about whats up?
[11:50:40] <alex-> jonathancutrell: This is part of a function. There is nothing more in it
[11:50:42] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: svg
[11:50:42] <alex-> only the function name
[11:50:42] <jonathancutrell> ximarin_: put that in a paste so we can see it a bit better.
[11:51:03] <alex-> jonathancutrell: can i pm you
[11:51:05] <alex-> ?
[11:51:05] <jonathancutrell> alex-: well, that doesn't tell me really anything at all unfortunately.
[11:51:16] <jonathancutrell> alex-: sure - if you have a URL or something for me. :)
[11:51:31] <alxm> alexr2: it appears the same in the dom - the class is set to "upc" and the number doesn't change
[11:52:07] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: I heard a podcast recently that outlines my issues with SVGâ€¦ There's not really enough tools to support the editing and easy transport of SVG stuff. But, I'm sure it's about as obscure as my particle explosion. Haha
[11:52:25] <ximarin_> it looks something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/zVyPd/
[11:52:42] <alexr2> i mean when you look at the dom when you run your app, what is in there?  i doubt that you see {{ hub.upc }} in there
[11:52:44] <alxm> alexr2: which loop?
[11:52:54] <alexr2> otherwise, it's not being compiled
[11:52:57] <alxm> alexr2, no I don't see hub.upc...I see the actual numbers
[11:53:14] <alxm> the output is correct, the javascript isn't updating the upc to what I want it to be though.
[11:53:15] <alexr2> use that for the jsfiddle
[11:53:32] <alexr2> because i just put regular numbers in there and it had no problem updating
[11:53:42] <jonathancutrell> ximarin_: my guess is, you're trying to do something with data below your .post() call, but you're doing it in parallel.
[11:53:57] <jonathancutrell> ximarin_: basically, you need to do it inside that callback function.
[11:54:14] <jonathancutrell> ximarin_: or use jquery promises/deferred objects
[11:54:26] <jonathancutrell> ximarin_: with the new AJAX spec
[11:54:49] <alxm> alexr2, interesting...hmm...
[11:54:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> jonathancutrell: can i show you my code in pm?
[11:55:24] <jonathancutrell> ecky--ptang-zoob: sure
[11:55:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tx
[11:55:35] <ecky--ptang-zoob> pastebin?
[11:55:46] <alxm> alexr2: yea..I just did the same thing and it seems to work.
[11:55:46] <Zneo> can any oune give me exemple withe serialize and form
[11:56:17] <alxm> alexr2: don't know why it isn't working in the django template...strange
[11:56:18] <rook2pawn> does .keydown() unbind any .keydown(fn) ?
[11:56:31] <jonathancutrell> ecky--ptang-zoob: that's fine
[11:56:40] <alexr2> *shrug*
[11:56:53] <alxm> alexr2: thanks for the help, now I know where to look at least.
[11:57:00] <tash> if I have a select whose id is "type" and I have 3 options ... to get the value of whatever option I choose, wouldn't $("#type").val(); be the thing I'd want?
[11:57:03] <alxm> appreciate it
[11:58:09] <Whirl3d> johnathancutrell, thanks for introducing me to the transit.js plugin. I was working on my own and this is great.
[12:01:02] <ximarin_> jonathancutrell: ok, got it, thx!
[12:01:05] <mattalexx> When using jquery UI dialog, inside of a button callback, how can I get a reference of the button element itself in order to change text when it's clicked?
[12:01:33] <alexr2> no problem alxm
[12:01:35] <jonathancutrell> ximarin_: yup
[12:01:47] <jonathancutrell> Whirl3d: indeed.
[12:02:32] <jonathancutrell> tash: generally speaking, yes.
[12:02:47] <jonathancutrell> tash: http://api.jquery.com/val/
[12:05:25] <Whirl3d> I have a situation where I want to create a library of settings that can be defined dynamically and applied to elements and I was hoping to find a tutorial on setting up "libraries" in jquery or js. Any ideas?
[12:05:44] <lmao25> I'm having trouble getting a variable to define, line 74.. what am i doing wrong? http://pastie.org/3757105
[12:06:54] <Whirl3d> Basically, I am working on a align method and would like to be able to say $.align("define",{name:"Special",x:alignxfunc, y:alignyfunc})...so that later I can just use: $.align("Special");  for example
[12:07:12] <rook2pawn> is it .off("keydown") ?
[12:10:39] <Whirl3d> mattakexx, did you try using $(this) inside your callback to refer to the button? If the click-target is inside the button element, you might have to use $(this).closest(buttonselector);
[12:10:55] <Whirl3d> *mattalexx, sry
[12:11:14] <rook2pawn> i have $(document).keydown(fn).. how do i unbind this?
[12:11:53] <Whirl3d> $(document).unbind("keydown"); ?
[12:11:56] <forbiddenjutsu> is there a website where i can submit a string and then get back the regular expression for it?
[12:12:17] <PavelloZ|home> lol
[12:12:22] <rook2pawn> Whirl3d: that's what im asking
[12:12:33] <QueueQueue> lmao25: What issue are you having?
[12:12:51] <lmao25> QueueQueue,  I can't get var total to define at all.
[12:13:04] <QueueQueue> Also, you're declaring total outside of a method, and then declaring it again as a private variable within the function below
[12:13:06] <Whirl3d> forbiddenjutsu, try http://gskinner.com/RegExr/
[12:13:26] <forbiddenjutsu> ooooh aaah
[12:13:37] <Whirl3d> rook2pawn, tias?
[12:13:43] <lmao25> QueueQueue, how could i properly declare it then?
[12:13:54] <lmao25> if i put it inside the function it will reset back to 9
[12:13:56] <lmao25> 0*
[12:14:15] <forbiddenjutsu> thnx
[12:14:50] <ryanneufeld> I
[12:14:56] <ryanneufeld> I am trying to use this code https://gist.github.com/859940
[12:15:05] <ryanneufeld> to perform a cross domain post
[12:15:16] <rook2pawn> Whirl3d: I wonder why $(document).off('keydownÂ') failed with eleent has no property off, whereas $(doc).unbind('keydown') worked just fine
[12:15:24] <ryanneufeld> to a subdomain. however chrome doesn't seem to like it. I'm not sure why.
[12:16:04] <QueueQueue> lmao25, you shouldn't need to re-declare it in the method as you are now.
[12:16:20] <Whirl3d> rook2pawn, I am not an expert, but I believe that .off unbinds events bound with .on
[12:16:57] <Whirl3d> rook2pawn, so perhaps it doesn't unbind events bound with "bind" or with shortcut bindings like ".keydown"
[12:17:18] <QueueQueue> Have you tried   total = total + final_cost;  instead of  var total = total + final_cost;
[12:17:25] <forbiddenjutsu> but this site is backwards http://gskinner.com/RegExr/
[12:17:36] <johnkpaul> rook2pawn: what version of jquery are you using
[12:17:40] <johnkpaul> .off was added in 1.6 I believe
[12:17:44] <forbiddenjutsu> can it create the regular expression for me?
[12:18:00] <ryanneufeld> forbiddenjutsu: no, that site will let you test your regexp
[12:18:07] <Whirl3d> forbiddenjutsu, what do you mean?
[12:18:08] <ryanneufeld> there are some examples though that you can use
[12:18:34] <forbiddenjutsu> Whirl3d, i need to create regex for strings, not test them
[12:18:39] <Whirl3d> like, what would you provide as input for creating a reqular expression?
[12:18:42] <rook2pawn> johnkpaul: ah 1.6.2
[12:19:03] <johnkpaul> !eval $().off
[12:19:17] <johnkpaul> where's the bot?
[12:19:21] <johnkpaul> !eval $().jquery
[12:19:23] <johnkpaul> !help
[12:19:36] <forbiddenjutsu> Whirl3d, if i give the site a word i should get back a regex
[12:19:44] <johnkpaul> rook2pawn: .off was added in 1.7
[12:19:47] <johnkpaul> http://api.jquery.com/off/
[12:19:53] <Whirl3d> well, that's easy enough /word/
[12:19:56] <ryanneufeld> forbiddenjutsu: if you have the word, then you have the regexp
[12:20:29] <ryanneufeld> forbiddenjutsu: if your word was 'dog' then the regexp would be /dog/
[12:20:33] <forbiddenjutsu> ryanneufeld, the word is apart of another string, sentence
[12:20:45] <ryanneufeld> forbiddenjutsu: do you understand how regexp works?
[12:21:22] <forbiddenjutsu> v_mobileUAFlag=AA&v_locale=en_JM&bookingPathStateId=1333998477273-208
[12:21:35] <tash> I'm curious to know if I'm doing this wrong ... I want the value of id="type" and I want to pass it on line 14 of this pastie http://pastie.org/3757419 ... for some reason though, 'All Types' is getting passed every time.  is my syntax wrong?
[12:21:37] <forbiddenjutsu> i need the number
[12:22:46] <QueueQueue> tash, you're getting the type on load it seems, not on change of the dropdown
[12:22:56] <ryanneufeld> forbiddenjutsu: http://regexr.com?30ja6
[12:22:59] <QueueQueue> and "all types" is selected on load
[12:24:07] <rook2pawn> johnkpaul: That explains it!
[12:24:18] <forbiddenjutsu> ryanneufeld, arent there any sites that automate the creation of regexp?
[12:24:26] <johnkpaul> :) yup
[12:24:44] <ryanneufeld> forbiddenjutsu: not that I know of, That's kind of a backwards way of doing it.
[12:25:09] <gnarf> regular expressions are a relatively simple grammar to learn
[12:25:20] <ryanneufeld> forbiddenjutsu: if you're using regexp, your well served to understand what you're doing
[12:25:30] <johnkpaul> forbiddenjutsu: that's like asking if there's an automated way to code
[12:25:36] <gnarf> most things are literal... () are used for grouping, [] are used for "classes (match some character in the list)" - etc
[12:25:38] <johnkpaul> or an automated way to write an algorithm
[12:25:44] <johnkpaul> I guess you could make a genetic algorithm
[12:25:48] <johnkpaul> to try to find your correct regex
[12:25:52] <johnkpaul> that'd be really really interesting actually
[12:26:00] <johnkpaul> man, if I had the free time, this'd be an awesome project
[12:26:14] <forbiddenjutsu> http://txt2re.com
[12:26:39] <Whirl3d> forbiddenjutsu, you could try: /Id=((?:\d+)(?:-(?:\d+))?)/ might work.
[12:27:11] <tash> QueueQueue, ah makes sense
[12:27:12] <johnkpaul> whoa

[12:32:00] <ParanoidGal> ;)
[12:32:12] <tw2113> can't guarantee anything, i was mostly saying hi :D
[12:32:26] <tw2113> plus i don't have mac for testing
[12:32:32] <forbiddenjutsu> the number is never the same
[12:32:54] <ParanoidGal> for fading forbideenjutsu?
[12:33:06] <Whirl3d> forbiddenjutsu, try http://regexr.com?30jau
[12:33:08] <ParanoidGal> I did think that might be an issue tw2113
[12:33:16] <ParanoidGal> Look on the iPhone ;)
[12:33:23] <johnkpaul> ParanoidGal: I don't see the problem you're describing
[12:33:31] <forbiddenjutsu> will try it
[12:33:36] <tw2113> no firefox for it
[12:33:43] <johnkpaul> none of the images in the carousel fade out for me

[12:33:50] <ParanoidGal> Which is making it hard to solve!
[12:33:51] <jonathancutrell> forbiddenjutsu: The problem is, a lot of regex's will match a given string.
[12:34:16] <tw2113> you're it ParanoidGal
[12:34:25] <gnarf> Whirl3d: why did you (?: that first inner capture group?
[12:34:29] <mattalexx> Whirl3d, No time, I ended up hacking it in using :contains(). Thanks though
[12:35:06] <mattalexx> Whirl3d, It's a nasty legacy system anyway that's about to be abandoned.
[12:35:10] <gnarf> Whirl3d: /Id=((\d)+(?:-(\d+))?/ seems better
[12:35:16] <Whirl3d> http://regexr.com?30jb1
[12:35:28] <Whirl3d> gnarf, agreed
[12:36:09] <tash> QueueQueue: so regarding my .val() ... onchange can I tell it to set the var and make it accessible outside of that function?
[12:36:57] <gnarf> Sorry /Id=((\d)+(?:-(\d+))?)/
[12:37:25] <gnarf> damn + moved on me
[12:37:27] <gnarf>  /Id=((\d+)(?:-(\d+))?)/
[12:37:47] <QueueQueue> yes, declare the variable type outside of the following $('#type').change(function(){type= $('#type').val();});
[12:38:07] <ryanneufeld> gnarf forbiddenjutsu bookingPathStateId=([0-9]{13}-[0-9]{3})
[12:38:30] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: \d === [0-9]
[12:38:35] <ryanneufeld> that will also match your example. However it will only work if the id mets that exact format
[12:38:51] <gnarf> but yeah, if its always in that format its better to be more specific than less
[12:38:55] <Whirl3d> and ryanneufeld, the problem is that the number could have - or not,
[12:39:02] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I know, I was pointing out the 'more than one way to skin a cat'
[12:39:13] <ryanneufeld> aspect of regexp
[12:40:33] <Whirl3d>  I have a situation where I want to create a library of settings that can be defined dynamically and applied to elements and I was hoping to find a tutorial on setting up "libraries" in jquery or js. Any ideas?
[12:40:54] <min|dvir|us-work> Where can I find a list of events that an iframe will fire natively?
[12:41:09] <asidjazz> like their jobs?
[12:41:16] <asidjazz> like an iframe event layoff?
[12:41:31] <min|dvir|us-work> asidjazz, not sure what you just said. I just want a list of names of events.
[12:43:34] <macmartine> I can get the value of the selected item in a dropdown with $(event.target).val(), but how do I get the text() of that item?
[12:43:47] <NoiseEee> min|dvir|us-work: an iframe is another window that holds a document
[12:44:09] <NoiseEee> min|dvir|us-work: iframes themselves don't "fire" anything
[12:45:26] <min|dvir|us-work> NoiseEee, sure they do.
[12:45:40] <min|dvir|us-work> NoiseEee, .load(), .hover(), etc.
[12:48:16] <NoiseEee> min|dvir|us-work: pretty sure both of those aren't quite what you might think.  ie: load() refers to the iframe element itself (<iframe>) and not the .src of the iframe iirc
[12:48:42] <QueueQueue> "According to the W3C, the <iframe> tag does not support any event attributes. However, the onload event is supported in all browsers."
[12:49:20] <Whirl3d> This may be a stupid question, but the hashchange event doesn't fire whenever window.location.hash is touched, right? so if I change the hash to the same value, it's not gonna re-fire the hashchange event since it didn't actually change, is it?
[12:50:06] <Whirl3d> *re-fire the hashchange event handler...
[12:50:13] <QueueQueue> macmartine  $("#mydrodown option:selected").text();
[12:50:39] <macmartine> QueueQueue: I don't have the id -- I have the event.target
[12:52:27] <ajpiano> $(event.target).find("option:selected")
[12:53:10] <QueueQueue> macmartine $("#" + event.target.id +" option:selected").text();
[12:53:16] <ajpiano> :o
[12:53:20] <ajpiano> don't do that.
[12:53:35] <macmartine> ajpiano: thanks
[12:54:10] <csurap> How do I know which day is selected date, like if i select April 9th then its second monday of april.
[12:54:11] <QueueQueue> ajpiano: why not?
[12:54:27] <ajpiano> QueueQueue: because, like he said, he has the event target
[12:54:44] <QueueQueue> which you can get the id from
[12:54:51] <ajpiano> if you have a reference to a dom element, getting the id from that reference and then using it to query the dom to get the same element you originally haad
[12:55:01] <ajpiano> seems like a mighty inefficient way of going about that doesn't it
[12:55:31] <QueueQueue> valid point
[12:55:48] <QueueQueue> It works, but you are right.
[12:56:21] <ajpiano> yah, i see a lot of people make that mistake.  it defintiely works but it's just the type of thing i would like to see corrected out of everyone :)
[12:56:46] <QueueQueue> I agree, it will be something I will stay mindful of. Thanks :)
[12:56:54] <ajpiano> :D
[13:00:07] <Whirl3d> I have a series of div with ".article" class that run down a parent div with ".page" class and I want to find the article that is at the top of the viewport (page is a scrolling div). Is there an easy way to do this?
[13:01:02] <ajpiano> ?g tuupola viewport selectors @ Whirl3d
[13:01:03] <caniuse> Whirl3d: Viewport Selectors for jQuery - Mika Tuupola - http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/viewport
[13:01:06] <ajpiano> use that and get the first one
[13:01:10] <ajpiano> :)
[13:01:21] <johnkpaul> tuupola?
[13:01:33] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, thanks.
[13:01:38] <ajpiano> that's the guy's name who wrote it
[13:01:46] <johnkpaul> ah I see
[13:02:40] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, so I would still have to cycle through all the articles until Ifound the first one not "abovethefold"
[13:03:04] <QueueQueue> ajpiano: that seems pretty cool, will have to bookmark that.
[13:03:05] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: $(".article:in-viewport").first()
[13:03:59] <spets> how can I select elements that has one class and not has some other.
[13:04:02] <Whirl3d> AHA! I see that now. Great. Thanks again ajpiano, and johnkpaul.

[13:05:38] <spets> johnkpaul: works great thanks
[13:05:51] <johnkpaul> no problem
[13:15:48] <jonathancutrell> spets: Another possibility is .not(".classname")
[13:16:49] <spets> jonathancutrell: yes thats what I've just used and got worked
[13:18:01] <ihdev> I am building a basic app with jquery mobile as the front end to capture information and serve content based on some basic logic (it is basically a glorified multipage form with conditionals). What is the best way to build something like this form a backend perspective, and where should I store content for the best accessibility (post to a google doc?).
[13:18:25] <g0rd0n> hi there! i seem to have a problem to achieve a seemingly simple thing... i am getting a javascript with getScript, want to do some string replacement and return the string... however it doesn't work, I always get that data is undefined: $.getScript('http://searchirc.com/official_rank.php?ID=3305&outof=1', function(data, textStatus, jqxhr) { data.replace('document.write ("', ''); data.replace('");', ''); alert(data);
[13:18:25] <g0rd0n>  });
[13:18:29] <g0rd0n> what am i doing wrong?
[13:19:05] <ajpiano> g0rd0n: ajax is asynchronous
[13:19:31] <g0rd0n> ajpiano: i know, that function is a callback right?
[13:19:42] <ajpiano> you can't, from the callback,  "return" what the server returns
[13:20:09] <ajpiano> g0rd0n: you're doing the work in the callback, but doing the alert outside of it, which means you're doing the alert *before* the callback
[13:20:23] <g0rd0n> ok i formulated wrong, i am not returning anything, actually i just want to write that in an html element
[13:20:50] <g0rd0n> the alert is IN the callback
[13:21:17] <ajpiano> oh i misread sorry
[13:21:34] <alexr2> doesn't document.write only work as long as page isn't fully loaded yet?
[13:22:15] <biberao> its advised to use jquery with ajax?
[13:22:39] <g0rd0n_> alexr2: well i don't know, the problem is if i just include that javascript in the page it wont actually work, so i just want to get the contents of the code, strip that document.write out and grab the html inside of it so i can write it where i want
[13:23:04] <router> whats up
[13:23:17] <ihdev> g0rd0n: check the script your getScript is fecthing
[13:23:52] <alexr2> you don't haev to write the javascript file you're loading to the page for it to exist, the getscript function already does that for you
[13:24:02] <ihdev> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/ - "Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it."
[13:24:36] <g0rd0n_> oh ok, will try with just .get then
[13:25:12] <Whirl3d> I need to be able to manually change the hash, I do this by setting a global MANUALHASH variable to true and then in the hashchange handler, if MANUALHASH, I reset it to false and return, if not, I load the new contet. Is it better to use a global variable for this or is there a better way?
[13:25:42] <g0rd0n_> that reminds me i tried with get before but somehow it fails, the response is empty (says firebug) which is odd, cause if i open the script manually in a tab it loads fine
[13:26:24] <router> hey
[13:26:28] <router> whats up with ruby
[13:26:52] <ihdev> when I run your script in console it works just fine
[13:26:55] <alexr2> you should probably ask the people in #ruby about that :-P
[13:27:04] <ihdev> add a semicolon to the end of your js file?
[13:27:04] <ihdev> haha
[13:27:14] <ihdev> view-source:http://searchirc.com/official_rank.php?ID=3305&outof=1
[13:27:54] <alexr2> g0rd0n_, keep in mind that you won't have access to that script until the load completes... so you have to wait for the callback to use it
[13:28:38] <g0rd0n_> alexr2: i am only using it in the callback
[13:29:16] <g0rd0n_> maybe there is a problem related to the fact that i actually load the stuff from an ajax jqueryui tab? :|
[13:30:06] <g0rd0n_> http://denorastats.org/magirc/ <- next to the two graphs, a little box from searchirc should appear... however it's not there... but if you load just the contets of the tab directly via http://denorastats.org/magirc/network/status you can see it shows there
[13:30:08] <alexr2> Show your code -> jsfiddle.net
[13:30:30] <g0rd0n_> so basically i am trying to work around this by getting the code and extracting the html from it so i can write it in an html element
[13:31:09] <ihdev> try catching the error
[13:31:14] <ihdev> "Due to browser security restrictions, most "Ajax" requests are subject to the same origin policy; the request can not successfully retrieve data from a different domain, subdomain, or protocol."
[13:31:21] <ihdev> to see what it is
[13:31:43] <g0rd0n_> ihdev: oh shit
[13:34:25] <g0rd0n_> ihdev: so basically even if i load the code via <script language="JavaScript" src="http://searchirc.com/official_rank.php?ID=Teranova&outof=1"></script> it will not work if that tag is insed an ajax-loaded tab?
[13:34:40] <g0rd0n_> s/insed/inside
[13:35:01] <ihdev> you can link to js files from another source, you just can't call them via ajax I think
[13:35:58] <g0rd0n_> then i wonder why it won't work then... should show up here http://denorastats.org/magirc/ but i don't get any errors whatsover, it just remains blank
[13:36:26] <alexr2> loading a script with <script src="... will only work when the page initially loads
[13:36:36] <alexr2> so no, that won't work if a tab is loaded through ajax
[13:36:51] <g0rd0n_> but i use all sorts of javascript inside that tab
[13:36:56] <g0rd0n_> and that works fine
[13:37:10] <alexr2> using javascript is different than loading javascript files
[13:37:21] <ihdev> you just can't load js async from a different source (via ajax)
[13:37:30] <ihdev> for security reasons
[13:37:30] <g0rd0n_> ok
[13:37:56] <g0rd0n_> damn
[13:38:11] <ihdev> does the service you're using to pull data have an API? that should be your starting point
[13:38:31] <g0rd0n_> ihdev: unfortunately not, just that stupid script that document.writes...
[13:39:12] <ihdev> just pull the data in when the page loads by calling the js file, and store it somewhere until you need it later
[13:39:13] <ajpiano> g0rd0n_: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-misc/examples/loadadscript/
[13:40:52] <c0d3rg1rl> g0rd0n_: you could also add it without jQuery with plain/old createElement()/appendChild()
[13:41:16] <c0d3rg1rl> g0rd0n_: e.g. http://www.hunlock.com/blogs/Howto_Dynamically_Insert_Javascript_And_CSS
[13:45:29] <xmaddness> You guys ever seen a selector like @attribute
[13:50:00] <pixelhandler> yo
[13:50:15] <c0d3rg1rl> xmaddness: an id can contain special chars like @, you just have to escape it, e.g. id="@test" can be accessed with $('#\\@test')
[13:50:33] <c0d3rg1rl> xmaddness: see also http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[13:50:41] <xmaddness> hrmm
[13:51:35] <xmaddness> yeah this is being access like the following --> input[type='text']@placeholder where placeholder is a custom attr of the input elm
[13:51:47] <xmaddness> Just never seen it like this before
[13:52:32] <g0rd0n_> ajpiano, c0d3rg1rl thanks, i wrote those things down and will try them tomorrow, i'm going to bed
[13:52:44] <starsinmypockets> Is it possible to make an array like object of jquery objects that I can iterate over, apllying jquery methods to each nested object?
[13:53:19] <starsinmypockets> My question being: what is the preferred way to create and act on such a structure?
[13:53:35] <Eviltwin> Explain further
[13:53:39] <c0d3rg1rl> xmaddness: fyi: that's actually not the same as my example.
[13:53:43] <Eviltwin> jQuery objects are already array-like objects
[13:53:46] <ajpiano> starsinmypockets: getting all the elements into a single jquery object is a bit more comment
[13:53:48] <alexr2> array of objects, and for loop through that array
[13:53:49] <ajpiano> common*
[13:53:58] <Eviltwin> So are you saying an array-like object of jQuery objects?
[13:54:14] <starsinmypockets> Eviltwin - yes
[13:54:18] <chovy> starsinmypockets: $.each($("input"), function(i, input){ //do something});
[13:54:22] <Eviltwin> Okay, why do you have such a structure?
[13:54:43] <starsinmypockets> Well, I need to update the attributes of a series of form elements...
[13:56:12] <Eviltwin> Well you can do $.each(arrayOfjQueryObjects, function() { this.jQueryMethod(); });
[13:56:25] <starsinmypockets> http://pastebin.com/TKtfiLqG
[13:57:10] <Eviltwin> var $newDom = [];
[13:57:22] <Eviltwin> Then ditch the var before the subsequent $newDom's
[13:57:37] <starsinmypockets> Eviltwin - ok, excellent, then I can act on them in a loop...
[13:57:46] <Eviltwin> Correct
[13:57:54] <starsinmypockets> ;D
[14:01:50] <c0d3rg1rl> what's the most elegant way to add attr('target', '_blank') to all outgoing links, i.e. links which do not have the current domain in url?
[14:03:39] <gdr> c0d3rguy
[14:04:30] <starsinmypockets> Eviltwin - a corollary to my question is - is this a sensible way to loop through jQuery objects?
[14:04:59] <alexr2> c0d3rg1rl loop through all links, search for http://www.yourdomain, if doesn't exist, add that target _blank
[14:05:43] <alexr2> or better, in your html add a class in all outlinks, and just search for selector and add that attribute
[14:05:47] <c0d3rg1rl> alexr2: I do that already but I thought there could be a more elegant solution within the selector
[14:06:05] <c0d3rg1rl> a class to all links is not possible
[14:06:09] <Whirl3d> $("a['href']).filter(function () {return $(this).attr('href'.indexOf("window.location.domain')?null:$(this);}).attr("target","_blank")  maybe?
[14:06:15] <ajpiano> ?g ben alman urlexternal plugin @ c0d3rg1rl
[14:06:16] <caniuse> c0d3rg1rl: Ben Alman Â» jQuery urlInternal Â» Examples Â» urlInternal / urlExternal ... - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-urlinternal/examples/urlinternal/
[14:06:27] <ajpiano> c0d3rg1rl: that plugin adds a pseudoselector you can use
[14:06:30] <xmaddness> c0d3rg1rl: yeah I know its very weird
[14:12:15] <alexr2> or $('a').not('[href^="http://www.yourdomain.com"]').attr("target","_blank")
[14:12:21] <alexr2> i feel like fit'ers a little extreme?
[14:12:27] <alexr2> filter's*
[14:12:44] <c0d3rg1rl> ah, did not think of .not(), tried a lot with :not() but to no avail
[14:12:56] <Escherial> hey, i'm about to work on an editor that synchronizes a graphical editor with xml; it'll be kind of a side-by-side display where changes to the xml are reflected in the graphical ui and vice versa
[14:13:39] <Escherial> is this crazy ambitious? i'm planning to use jquery to parse the xml and display the graphical side, but there'll clearly be many times when it won't parse...is there some way to catch the resulting exceptions from it not parsing?
[14:14:10] <supsup> anyway to transition a coke can from a front on perspective to seeing just the top or is that in realm of webgl only... would it require too many images and be sluggish?
[14:14:30] <Escherial> (for what it's worth, i'm fairly competent with html, css, javascript, python, php, asp.net, and jquery...been at web development for about ten years and computer science pretty much my whole life, so i'm comfortable programming)
[14:16:57] <sandbags> I'm trying to use .on( "click" ), can someone tell me what I am missing: https://gist.github.com/678683e9daf014232662#comments ?
[14:19:07] <alexr2> sandbags, build it in jsfiddle.net
[14:19:18] <alexr2> including the html that you have
[14:20:24] <Escherial> sandbags: why not use the regular click() handler, e.g. $("body").click(function() { /* etc. */ }) ?
[14:20:35] <Escherial> ah, wait, never mind
[14:22:13] <sandbags> alexr2: does jsfiddle have a console?
[14:22:35] <alexr2> you can just use firefox's or chrome's
[14:22:40] <alexr2> it'll print out there no problem
[14:22:54] <sandbags> oh i see
[14:22:55] <sandbags> yes
[14:23:16] <sandbags> so the basic syntax seems to work here
[14:23:37] <alexr2> then it's probably something else causing the issue
[14:23:53] <alexr2> also, make sure you're up to date with jquery
[14:23:56] <ajpiano> probably jquery isn't loaded properly?
[14:24:05] <sandbags> jquery is loaded
[14:24:07] <alexr2> .on was only added jquery 1.7
[14:24:19] <sandbags> Ah! what version am i using... ha
[14:24:40] <sandbags> yes that would explain the error best
[14:24:55] <sandbags> it confused me because i was assuming on() was defined!
[14:25:09] <alexr2> :-)
[14:25:20] <sandbags> 1.6.1
[14:25:22] <sandbags> there we go
[14:25:28] <sandbags> thanks alexr2
[14:26:22] <sandbags> jsfiddle is rather cool also
[14:26:26] <WebDragon> anyone here handling the scripting on the jquery forums signup ?
[14:26:49] <WebDragon> the zoho signup form on jquery forums is broken in opera -- the scripting prevents one from tabbing into the email field,and additionally prevented me from clicking into the URL bar to copy the offending address of the iframe so I could paste it here
[14:27:45] <alexr2> no problem
[14:32:27] <Whirl3d> jquery bbq with deparam, querystring, and a whole mess of thoroughly over-documented options and methods is enough to drive a strugglin' developer to drink. Anbody got a bbq 101 tutorial reference?
[14:34:11] <c0d3rg1rl> got it, so this works: $("a[href^='http://']:not([href^='http://"+window.location.hostname+"']").attr("target","_blank"); but this does not: $("a:not([href^='http://"+window.location.hostname+"']").attr("target","_blank");
[14:34:22] <c0d3rg1rl> I wonder why the second does not work..
[14:36:04] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jquerymobile: Anyone want to help us alpha test ThemeRoller for 1.1.0? Give me an email and have a 1.0 theme ready for testing. â˜… http://bit.ly/HY6Cp2
[14:36:06] <Whirl3d> I think that href automatically gets http://  (curent url) added....or at least it seems like that in my experience.
[14:36:37] <Whirl3d> so by adding the second part, you eliminate all hrefs
[14:38:47] <Whirl3d> c0d3rg1rl, maybe it would be better to check if the href contains the current window.location.hostname rather than starts with http://window.location.hostname....?
[14:39:20] <c0d3rg1rl> Whirl3d: I think it checks the current
[14:39:42] <c0d3rg1rl> but bad news, this line locks up IE7 if called in ready()
[14:41:08] <c0d3rg1rl> hm, no elegant solution again :)
[14:41:22] <Whirl3d> $("a['href']).not([href*=window.location.hostname]).attr("target","_blank");
[14:41:34] <ajpiano> c0d3rg1rl: it would be best probably to just use .filter(function() {/*and do string checking of this.href vs document.location.href*/  }) or use the plugin i linked you to earlier
[14:42:07] <c0d3rg1rl> ajpiano: yes, I have a solution, but I wanted a elegant and simple "one-liner"
[14:42:21] <ajpiano> elegance is subjective
[14:42:31] <c0d3rg1rl> yeah
[14:42:31] <ajpiano> jamming it into a selector doesn't magically make it elegant
[14:42:49] <c0d3rg1rl> but actually it should not lock up IE7
[14:43:10] <c0d3rg1rl> I wonder why that happens.
[14:43:24] <ajpiano> i would imagine including the plugin and then doing $("a:urlExternal").attr("target","_blank")
[14:43:33] <ajpiano> would be the "most elegant"
[14:43:46] <ajpiano> usually that is a sign that you have an improperly escaped selector
[14:43:50] <c0d3rg1rl> ajpiano: I already downloaded the plugin
[14:43:51] <ajpiano> that is making the regex engine go wild
[14:44:00] <c0d3rg1rl> ajpiano: but the same line works in FF
[14:44:08] <ajpiano> IE and FF don't have the same JS engine
[14:44:42] <forbiddenjutsu> whats %20? where can i find a list of uri codes?
[14:45:22] <fris> %20 is a space
[14:47:53] <fris> http://www.obkb.com/dcljr/chars.html
[14:49:19] <c0d3rg1rl> ajpiano: the solution with :not() locks up IE7, with .not() it works: $("a[href^='http://']").not("[href^='http://"+window.location.hostname+"']").attr("target","_blank");
[14:51:22] <ajpiano> c0d3rg1rl: because the slashes inside of the window.location aren't being properly escaped before going into jquery
[14:51:49] <c0d3rg1rl> ajpiano: in .hostname there should not be any slashes?
[14:52:03] <ajpiano> true enough
[14:52:42] <ajpiano> c0d3rg1rl: all i am sayin is every single time i have seen a "bug" about regexy selectors freezing up ie it has something to do with invalid inpu
[14:54:23] <c0d3rg1rl> ajpiano: well then I could imagine that the slashes in 'href^='http://.. cause trouble in :not() but not in .not()
[14:55:58] <c0d3rg1rl> thanks for help anyway!
[14:58:56] <WebDragon> ajpiano: think I found a bug in FF11 : http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/wkSBX/
[14:59:30] <WebDragon> was yacking around with it here the other day with Vordreller
[15:00:06] * ajpiano opens link in Chrome
[15:00:42] <WebDragon> works fine in Opera and Chrome
[15:00:55] <WebDragon> still unsure about IE9 since I don't have it here handy to test with
[15:04:44] <c0d3rg1rl> WebDragon: nice example (besides the FF11 bug which I can confirm)
[15:08:55] <pajo> what does the :first selector return if there aren't any elements if that type?
[15:10:12] <sandbags> anyone have any notion why pressing a key once would result in two calls to the keypress() handler?
[15:10:14] <Raverix> Nothing.
[15:10:30] <Raverix> sandbags KeyDown, KeyUp
[15:10:57] <Raverix> "Note that keydown and keyup provide a code indicating which key is pressed, while keypress indicates which character was entered. For example, a lowercase "a" will be reported as 65 by keydown and keyup, but as 97 by keypress. An uppercase "A" is reported as 65 by all events. Because of this distinction, when catching special keystrokes such as arrow keys, .keydown() or .keyup() is a better
[15:10:57] <Raverix> choice."
[15:11:01] <Raverix> Do try and read the documentation.
[15:11:36] <sandbags> Raverix: snideness aside, thank you. This wasn't happening a few minutes ago so I hadn't gathered it was intended.
[15:12:58] <Raverix> Well, snideness aside, I might be thinking of something else.
[15:13:00] <sandbags> Raverix: reading that page and your quoted section
[15:13:04] <sandbags> i don't see the relevance
[15:13:13] <Raverix> Neither do I :)
[15:13:49] <c0d3rg1rl> WebDragon: with IE9 there is no magnify glass, no rounded borders and css('background') retiruns empty/null
[15:14:04] <sandbags> if i was holding the key i might assume it was key-repeat
[15:14:07] <sandbags> but i'm single-pressing
[15:14:08] <sandbags> ah
[15:14:10] <sandbags> one difference
[15:14:18] <sandbags> i just switched out jQ 1.6.1 for 1.7.2
[15:15:04] <Whirl3d> is there any easier way of handling .next() so that it's circular (returns to :first if on the last element?) I tried this: but no luck---odd though: http://jsfiddle.net/337MS/7/
[15:15:21] <c0d3rg1rl> WebDragon: also with IE9 the field does not become grey if focused, no change at all if focused.
[15:16:21] <sandbags> maybe i should use keyDown instead of keyPress
[15:17:22] <sandbags> oh most odd, i'm getting two keypresses:, ergo i must be installing my handler twice i guess
[15:17:54] <sandbags> bingo
[15:18:07] <clm> how did your jQ upgrade go sandbags? just attr  -  prop changes or anything else
[15:18:30] <sandbags> clm: i didn't make any changes at all
[15:18:41] <clm> i'm about to upgrade jQ too
[15:19:17] <clm> ah I've got an older version 1.4.2 to upgrade to 1.7.2
[15:19:58] <clm> as far as I can tell I just need to change my boolean attr calls to use prop instead
[15:20:34] <clm> anyone else go from 1.4 to 1.7 jQ?
[15:21:28] <sandbags> okay so something odd must have changed about loading, unbinding keypress before binding resolved the double-handler issue
[15:21:46] <sandbags> or i screwed up somehow
[15:21:56] <sandbags> which seems, on the face of it, the more likely explanation
[15:22:50] <catcher> What does alert use for modal functionality? Is there something built-in I can use, or do I need to rebuild/get a plugin?
[15:23:47] <ajpiano> catcher: alert is a native thing, it doesn't "use" anything
[15:25:25] <Whirl3d> what simple thing am I doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/337MS/16/
[15:25:42] <catcher> ajpiano, gotcha, I was hoping there was something modular built in that did the darken/overlay/close stuff.
[15:25:43] <Whirl3d> I'm just trying to get .next and .prev to cycle to the first element if on the last
[15:26:32] <Whirl3d> wait, I meant .siblings().first()....sorry
[15:31:34] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: a bunch of things
[15:31:36] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/337MS/24/
[15:31:46] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: you had a bunch of syntax errors in the prevButton handler
[15:31:55] <ajpiano> and mainly you had to get the *last* sibling in the case of doing prev
[15:32:13] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: also, you don't have to store the *old* functions on the jquery protoype, but if you are, then you don't have to call $.fn.whatever.apply
[15:32:18] <ajpiano> you can just do what i did
[15:32:52] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: otherwise you'd do this http://jsfiddle.net/337MS/27/
[15:33:16] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/337MS/26/, lol
[15:33:29] <Whirl3d> thanks a ton for your help. Checking out your second fiddle now
[15:34:40] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, that's what I was looking for. I couldn't figure out the apply  part. Thanks a lot
[15:35:19] <WebDragon> c0d3rg1rl: thanks (re: nice example)
[15:35:43] <WebDragon> c0d3rg1rl: really, IE9 also has a css("background") issue ?
[15:36:15] <WebDragon> c0d3rg1rl: interesting on the focus issue too on IE9. I may have to rethink how I'm applying these styles :/
[15:37:41] <c0d3rg1rl> WebDragon: Did you already try to use the single background properties, like background-url etc.?
[15:38:06] <c0d3rg1rl> instead of the "one declaration" way?
[15:39:00] <WebDragon> actually I'd presumed that the shorthand version would just work since setting these things individually can be a pain (particularly with layering multiple backgrounds)
[15:39:17] <RPkS> johnkpaul: I found the problem with the product pages that didn't have any additional images. Some how I had  <?php } ?> under the closing div.
[15:39:24] <WebDragon> and especially with the complex definition of the gradient necessary to ensure it works everywhere possible
[15:39:30] <c0d3rg1rl> yes, I see. never saw layered backgrounds though before, I must admit :)
[15:40:21] <WebDragon> c0d3rg1rl: we're doing a nifty thing on the main site http://360.client-proof.com/ in the footer with the paper-tear, over the footer with another layer overlaying the byline
[15:40:38] <WebDragon> still working out the cross-browser kinks, I'll admit :)
[15:41:10] <WebDragon> but the magnifier was my boss' idea (and having it vanish when the box is focused)
[15:42:12] <WebDragon> I thought using the background property to grab whichever gradient definition was native to the browser, and then adding the additional background (image, scroll, repeat, position) on top of it, without having to separate all the values out individually to layer them individually) would have been more efficient
[15:42:34] <WebDragon> I had no idea that the .css("background") wasn't functioning the same cross-browser until I spotted this in FF11
[15:42:58] <WebDragon> I used jsfiddle to try it all the way back to jQuery 1.3.x so it's definitely something in FF doing it
[15:43:10] <WebDragon> (causing it to fail, I mean)
[15:43:21] <c0d3rg1rl> Maybe (if all fails) use a simple pre-rendered background-image for the whole search-field *duck'n'run*
[15:43:37] <WebDragon> vordreller posted about it here, and I followed up briefly https://forum.jquery.com/topic/firefox-bug-or-jquery-bug-in-css
[15:44:07] <WebDragon> c0d3rg1rl: yeah but it's less flexible too :)
[15:44:33] <tab1293> can anyone show me the correct way to use the on function? http://jsfiddle.net/rsr6p/16/
[15:46:13] <c0d3rg1rl> tab1293: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/rsr6p/17/
[15:47:09] <tab1293> can you do it outside of the callback anyway?
[15:47:18] <tab1293> c0d3rg1rl:?
[15:48:30] <WebDragon> tab1293: I used it recently for the slidebar on charterdejavu.com: in the slidebar.js : $("#slidebar .active").on('click', function (e) { window.location = $(this).find(".morelink").attr("href"); }); // .on replaces .live in jQuery 1.7
[15:49:03] <WebDragon> since I'm building the stuff on the fly, using .on was the way to go
[15:49:13] <c0d3rg1rl> tab1293: if you do it ourside the callback, like in your example, it is called on page load, not later after the click.
[15:50:56] <tab1293> i want to be able to link an event handler to an element on the page regardless of if that element is already loaded or not. how can i do that?
[15:51:03] <c0d3rg1rl> WebDragon: did you ever experiment with :before and :after to "enhance" a background?
[15:54:41] <WebDragon> c0d3rg1rl: not much since I'm unsure how much I can rely on that working in IE<9
[15:55:15] <c0d3rg1rl> ok, thanks.
[15:58:06] <tab1293> anyone?
[16:00:38] <c0d3rg1rl> tab1293: if an element does not exist, you can not attach a handler to it.
[16:00:58] <tab1293> c0d3rg1rl: just did by using the live function
[16:02:04] <c0d3rg1rl> where?
[16:02:24] <WebDragon> tab1293: http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/rsr6p/20/ works with .live but not with .on for some reason, in my Opera 11.62
[16:02:30] <Whirl3d> does .is check to see if the element is part of the collection passed to it? or does it check to see that it IS the colection passed to it?  !eval $("li:first").is($("li"))
[16:02:31] <WebDragon> haven't tried in chrome/ff yet
[16:02:52] <tab1293> http://jsfiddle.net/rsr6p/21/
[16:02:58] <WebDragon> c0d3rg1rl: see that fiddle I just pasted
[16:03:40] <WebDragon> .live works fine. .on() _should_ be replacing live in 1.7.2 but for some reason it isn't working. it SHOULD allow you to attach events to dom elements that are added later to the DOM than at document.ready
[16:03:40] <Whirl3d> nvm, I can use .has
[16:04:16] <tab1293> WebDragon: so is this a bug?
[16:04:26] <WebDragon> good question. ajpiano ?
[16:04:31] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jquerymobile: My social photo evolution: Flickr &gt;&gt; Instagram &gt;&gt; MS Paint + floppies   Guys, I need your addresses. Ok? â˜… http://bit.ly/Ic3iu3
[16:04:47] <WebDragon> so far as I'm aware, .on() should function about identically to .live()
[16:04:56] <ajpiano> uhhhhhh
[16:04:58] <WebDragon> http://jqapi.com/#p=on
[16:04:58] <ajpiano> np
[16:05:00] <ajpiano> nope
[16:05:04] <ajpiano> it provides the same functionality
[16:05:05] <WebDragon> similarly ?
[16:05:07] <ajpiano> not the same method signature
[16:05:19] <ajpiano> look on the docs for .live it clearly shows how to emulate live with on
[16:05:35] <ajpiano> $(document).on("click", ".foo", fn) is the same as $(".foo".live("click", fn);
[16:06:38] <tab1293> ajpiano: what is the .foo in that case?
[16:07:10] <WebDragon> why the switch to $(document) is my question
[16:07:11] <tab1293> you mean the same as $(".foo").live("click", fn);
[16:08:03] <WebDragon> tab1293: http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/rsr6p/22/ this works with .on now
[16:08:11] <WebDragon> ajpiano: thanks for the heads up
[16:08:31] <WebDragon> I hadn't noticed that bit about $(document) for some reason and had thought you could leave out the filter
[16:08:32] <tab1293> ok thanks guys
[16:11:30] <kba> anybody familiar with fullcalendar? How do I make allday events show up in week and day views? They only appear in month view
[16:17:57] * WebDragon puzzles over why .css("background") won't return a value on Firefox or IE9 
[16:18:17] <CH___> Hello. I'm trying to use jQuery to update part of my page through a form, and it works, but the form won't submit more than once. The function just isn't being called. Am I forgetting to reset something?
[16:18:18] <kba> WebDragon: perhaps you want background-color or similiar
[16:18:26] <WebDragon> kba: unfortunately no
[16:18:36] <kba> WebDragon: so what output do you expect?
[16:18:42] <WebDragon> kba: I've got a very complex gradient definition involved that is local to the individual browser
[16:19:07] <WebDragon> so the browser picks the gradient definition it can use and then I use jquery to layer something on top of it with css3 multiple background type definitions
[16:19:34] <kba> WebDragon: gradients are defined with background-image
[16:19:45] <WebDragon> to break out background color, image, repeat, position, and scroll and set each individually for the job of simply adding a magnifying glass icon overlaying the background of an input field seems a bit excessive
[16:20:07] <WebDragon> not to mention the part where it has to change on focus
[16:20:17] <WebDragon> kba: see this fiddle:
[16:20:40] <WebDragon> http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/wkSBX/embedded/result/
[16:20:55] <WebDragon> works exactly as it is supposed to in Opera and Chrome
[16:21:32] <WebDragon> falls down in FF and IE because .css("background") returns empty-string, or null; whichever, it's not the expected result
[16:22:48] <WebDragon> kba: look at the console.log output in chrome or opera
[16:23:01] <WebDragon> then compare in ff. totally whacked
[16:23:08] <WebDragon> plus in FF the .blur() fails too
[16:25:51] <kba> WebDragon: well, have you tried with background-image instead?
[16:26:12] <WebDragon> AND background-position, AND background-repeat AND background-etc ?
[16:26:35] <WebDragon> with the background: shorthand property I can set all these things at once
[16:26:45] <kba> WebDragon: well, for what it's worth, .css('border') returns nothing even if border-bottom is set
[16:26:47] <asidjazz> its hte WEBDRAGON
[16:26:53] <kba> I feel like it's kind of the same thing you're trying to do
[16:27:02] <lenswipe> hey guys
[16:27:18] <lenswipe> how do i send post data to the server using ajax but without a form?
[16:27:27] <lenswipe> i want to send my own dynamically generated post data
[16:27:29] <WebDragon> it's horribly inefficient to add all that extra style definition stuff when you can do it all in one line
[16:27:31] <z1000> Is there a way to detect content in view? So as I scroll into #some-section... In a respective nav list that has <a href="#some-section"> I can addClass('active') to the respective anchor? any content/section in view, has the respective nav item highlighted? – that seems like the only tricky part but I have seen it done before.
[16:28:13] <WebDragon> kba:  that's also something I would consider a bug PROVIDED that you can individually set each border-width, style, and color in a singie border: shorthand
[16:28:32] <WebDragon> and by that I mean border: 1px 2px 1px 4px solid black;
[16:28:43] <kba> wouldn't call it a bug, rather just an obvious feature that was left out
[16:29:00] <WebDragon> border: doesn't work the same way as background: though
[16:29:54] <asidjazz> THE WEB DRAGON SPEAKS
[16:29:55] <z1000> any thoughts on that anyone?
[16:29:59] <WebDragon> _especially_ when you start taking into account multiple definitions like css3 background:
[16:30:03] <lenswipe> guys
[16:30:05] <lenswipe> can someone help?
[16:30:10] <lenswipe> custom jquery post data
[16:30:13] <lenswipe> how do i do it
[16:30:29] <WebDragon> background: url("/images/tear-1.png") repeat-x, url("/images/footer_byline_tile.png") 50% 100% repeat-x, url("/images/footer_bg1_tiled.jpg") transparent;
[16:30:31] <z1000> lenswipe, just use ajax call on a button and serialize the data?
[16:30:38] <z1000> is that possible? lol
[16:30:41] <z1000> what are you sending exactly?
[16:30:47] <asidjazz> THE WEB DRAGON SPITS CSS3 KNOWLEDGE
[16:31:10] <WebDragon> things like that are including a pile of stuff in a much more condensed form than specifying each set separately
[16:31:10] <Jon47> lenswipe: haven't gotten to use this one in awhile ;) http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+ajax+post
[16:31:24] <lenswipe> Jon47, yeah i can use google thanks
[16:31:34] <lenswipe> z1000, im trying to send data to the server on a button press but i dont want to use a form
[16:31:43] <kba> lenswipe: doesn't seem like it
[16:31:46] <z1000> have you ever done it with a form?
[16:32:01] <lenswipe> z1000, yes, i use $('#form').serialize();
[16:32:11] <z1000> so what info are you trying to send exactly?
[16:32:16] <kba> lenswipe: and what does that return exactly?
[16:32:21] <lenswipe> i have no idea
[16:32:30] <kba> how about you start out by finding out?
[16:32:37] <z1000> lol bastards !
[16:32:43] <z1000> just use .val() then or something?
[16:33:02] <lenswipe> kba, nah i prefer to just fuck about asking stupid questions
[16:33:05] <lenswipe> </sarcasm>
[16:33:23] <kba> you don't need </sarcasm> there :-)
[16:33:31] <z1000> oh man
[16:33:35] <z1000> did anyone see my Q?
[16:33:44] <asidjazz> hey look its like html
[16:33:48] <asidjazz> but its not
[16:33:50] <asidjazz> cuz it says sarcasm
[16:34:00] <z1000> anyway to use .live() or have some sort of listener to say which div ID is in view on the screen?
[16:34:01] <lenswipe> ok so $('form').serialize(); is returning a HTML representation of the form
[16:34:09] <lenswipe> how that helps me in any way im not sure
[16:34:21] <z1000> how do I say IN VIEW with jquery?
[16:34:25] <kba> lenswipe: isn't not really a html representation
[16:34:38] <ajpiano> ?g tuupola viewport selectors @ z1000
[16:34:39] <bot-t> z1000, Viewport Selectors for jQuery - Mika Tuupola - http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/viewport
[16:34:53] <kba> lenswipe: but why doesn't that help you? I'd say it helps you immensely
[16:34:59] <lenswipe> um not really
[16:35:04] <z1000> thanks ajpiano I <3 you
[16:35:16] <z1000> I search jquery in view but didnt find it easy enough I guess
[16:35:32] <kba> lenswipe: now you just copy/pate the thing you used when submitting a form and replace $('form').serialize(); with something appropriate
[16:37:37] <lenswipe> yeah ive got everything else in the code
[16:37:47] <kba> so you solved it?
[16:37:53] <lenswipe> the only thing im not sure about is how to pass raw data to $.ajax() without using a form
[16:37:57] <lenswipe> i have the rest of the function sorted
[16:38:02] <lenswipe> just not the bit where i pass in data
[16:38:21] <blindMoe> hav eyou ever looked into what $.serialize() outputs?
[16:38:38] <asidjazz> i believe CP mostly
[16:38:39] * lenswipe throws blindMoe out of the window
[16:38:44] <lenswipe> wait CP?
[16:38:47] <lenswipe> Child Porn?!
[16:38:49] <asidjazz> cheeze pizza
[16:38:52] <lenswipe> ah ok
[16:39:03] <asidjazz> quick to the draw :)
[16:39:04] <kba> lenswipe: why throw him out? It's a good question. It doesn't seem like you have looked at the output at all.
[16:39:17] <lenswipe> i have looked at the output of serialize()
[16:39:21] <blindMoe> lenswipe: what you want is pretty straight forward
[16:39:23] <lenswipe> it returns the form as HTML
[16:39:30] <blindMoe> what?
[16:39:32] <kba> lenswipe: It's not html, but yeah, sure.
[16:39:35] <ajpiano> lenswipe: that's not html, it's a query string.
[16:39:42] <kba> lenswipe: it returns a query string of the form.
[16:39:44] <ajpiano> lenswipe: you want an object
[16:39:44] <blindMoe> look harder :)
[16:39:52] <ajpiano> lenswipe: see ?g ben alman serializeObject plugin
[16:39:53] <bot-t> lenswipe, Ben Alman » jQuery Misc plugins - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/
[16:40:24] <kba> lenswipe: it's pretty straight forward to mimic the behaviour of .serialize() it'd say.
[16:40:28] <ajpiano> there are other ways to get the object but that is the simplest
[16:40:37] <lenswipe> kba, http://imagebin.org/207384
[16:40:40] <lenswipe> thats what its returning
[16:40:50] <kba> lenswipe: No it's not.
[16:40:56] <lenswipe> yes it is
[16:41:06] <kba> What you just pasted on imagebin is not what .serialize() returns. End of discussion.
[16:41:07] <ajpiano> that's not html, that's a jquery object as represented in the chrome inspector
[16:41:26] <ajpiano> ie, when i say it's not html i mean it is not an html string
[16:41:40] <blindMoe> yeah it is in []'s
[16:41:46] <lenswipe> aha!
[16:41:48] <lenswipe> now its working
[16:41:50] <z1000> ajpiano, how can I repay you for all your good insights over the yrs
[16:41:50] <asidjazz> lenswipe: u pasted html as an image?
[16:42:03] <asidjazz> lenswipe: so fustrating i cannot highlight
[16:42:09] <lenswipe> asidjazz, yes because it was from chrome console
[16:42:35] <ajpiano> z1000: pay it forward :)
[16:42:45] <z1000> whats that mean exactly?
[16:42:51] <kba> lenswipe: did try try right-clicking in Chrome Console?
[16:43:02] <z1000> ill toss u 20 bucks my pleasure?
[16:43:03] <lenswipe> http://pastebin.com/VBTu7jRj
[16:43:26] <lenswipe> kba, yeah i get the option to clear the console and something about turning highlighting off
[16:43:27] <lenswipe> anyway
[16:43:35] <lenswipe> thats my jquer
[16:43:37] <lenswipe> jquery*
[16:43:51] <lenswipe> so someone said i just do it as a query string?
[16:44:02] <kba> lenswipe: start by examinig what .serialize() outputs. And no, you did not do that already.
[16:44:03] <ajpiano> lenswipe: you need a bloody object mate
[16:44:05] <blindMoe> you should know after looking at work $.serialize() is feeding it
[16:44:12] <blindMoe> s/work/what
[16:44:25] <kba> lenswipe: It's quite obvious after 2 minutes of looking at http://api.jquery.com/serialize/ as well
[16:44:33] <lenswipe> kba, yeah i just tested it again, it looks like a normal query string
[16:44:40] <lenswipe> kba, do i just formulate my own query string?
[16:44:48] <kba> lenswipe: Hurray. So you solved it!
[16:44:52] <lenswipe> ok thx
[16:45:00] <kba> You're welcome
[16:45:57] <multi_io> is there a generic API for setting the values in a form? Something like formelement.set(name, values) ?
[16:46:07] <smplstk> lol
[16:46:08] <mattalexx> If an $.post() called script ends up redirecting using HTTP, how can I get a string of that ultimate location?
[16:46:32] <multi_io> (where name would be the name of any input element, and values the values (more than one for checkboxes etc.)
[16:46:33] <mattalexx> Nothing in the headers is showing me the ultimate URL/
[16:46:51] <erichynds> mattalexx: ajax will follow status code redirects
[16:46:52] <multi_io> and it would work with all types of form elements.
[16:46:56] <snover> mattalexx: that information is not exposed
[16:47:02] <snover> xhr follows redirects transparently
[16:47:17] <mattalexx> thanks
[16:47:18] <snover> xhr2 may expose it
[16:47:26] <lenswipe> should i use & or &amp;?
[16:49:10] <mattalexx> lenswipe, Completely depends on where you're using it.
[16:50:23] <lenswipe> in what respect
[16:50:30] <lenswipe> its for a post query string
[16:50:53] <ajpiano> lenswipe: you know, by the way, that it's never valid to have input elements that aren't inside of a form, right?
[16:51:03] <WebDragon> kba, ajpiano : this does work in FF11 http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/wkSBX/31/  but it's far more messy code and prone to repetition-typing error than the original http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/wkSBX/
[16:51:20] <ajpiano> it works fine, but it's so much better to use a form and its submit event and then cancel the default action than just the click on a button
[16:51:50] <WebDragon> I'm having a hard time accepting that I'd have to laboriously spell everything out this way every time I wanted to manipulate background properties in such a manner
[16:52:04] <ajpiano> WebDragon: report it to mozilla?
[16:52:18] <WebDragon> is it a mozilla issue? I get the same problem in MSIE too
[16:52:29] <lenswipe> ajpiano, i do know that, and i dont have any
[16:52:34] <WebDragon> opera and chrome both return the correct value for .css("background") as I would have expected
[16:52:53] <lenswipe> ajpiano, im building a task manager app, people can view other people's tasks if they're set to public and can copy those tasks to their own task list
[16:52:54] <ajpiano> hmm,
[16:53:09] <ajpiano> ok.
[16:53:11] <ajpiano> have fun
[16:53:19] <ajpiano> WebDragon: you can report it to us with an explanation
[16:53:26] <ajpiano> if it's cross browser then we might fix it
[16:53:41] <lenswipe> ajpiano, so i get the task info(already on the page cos they're viewing the task) then build a query string using http_build_query() and then send that to my already written create() method
[16:53:42] <lenswipe> :)
[16:53:46] <lenswipe> or should i say action
[16:54:06] <ajpiano> lenswipe: then what are you serializing, if not a form?
[16:54:16] <lenswipe> im not serializing anything
[16:54:17] <WebDragon> ajpiano: vordreller started the topic here: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/firefox-bug-or-jquery-bug-in-css  I'll follow it up with this latest example showing the extreme differences in the coding style necessary (and the large amount of redundancy required)
[16:54:21] <ajpiano> ohhh
[16:54:24] <lenswipe> im just trying to figure out how to mimic serialize()
[16:54:25] <lenswipe> :)
[16:54:31] <ajpiano> lenswipe: oh
[16:54:37] <ajpiano> ?$.param @ lenswipe
[16:54:38] <bot-t> lenswipe, jQuery.param() - Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[16:54:39] <lenswipe> my task object is turned into a query string using http_build_query() :)
[16:54:46] <WebDragon> I'll add to it later tonight with my new findings -- would this be sufficient or is there a better place to report this
[16:54:53] <lenswipe> ajpiano, its a PHP object not a json object
[16:55:06] <ajpiano> WebDragon: i meant report it to us on the bug tracker
[16:55:18] <ajpiano> lenswipe: you've lost me
[16:55:21] <WebDragon> oh, I'll dig out the link on the main jquery site
[16:55:29] <ajpiano> WebDragon: http://bugs.jquery.com
[16:55:36] <WebDragon> ajpiano: should I link in the forum post ?
[16:55:42] <ajpiano> sure
[16:55:44] <WebDragon> k
[16:55:49] * WebDragon tips hat
[16:56:14] <lenswipe> ajpiano, my PHP task object is sent to my view for display, it is also sent to a bit of jquery on my page which contains " data: '<?= http_build_query($task, NULL, '&') ?>',"
[16:56:15] <kba> WebDragon: why are you even using jQuery and not just pure css for this to begin with?
[16:56:22] <lenswipe> ajpiano, simples :)
[16:56:33] <ajpiano> lenswipe: i meant "my interest has waned"
[16:56:38] <lenswipe> ah lol
[16:56:38] <WebDragon> kba: have you SEEN the incredibly convoluted gradient definition?
[16:57:10] <WebDragon> kba:  you think I want to re-edit that line-by-line to padd in the magnifier every time I adjust gradient with the gradient-generator?
[16:57:23] <WebDragon> and THEN do another one for the focus state?
[16:57:32] <ajpiano> wait wait
[16:57:40] <WebDragon> have you lost your mind? I'd rather do it with jquery. it's easier on my psyche let alone my fingers :D
[16:57:49] <ajpiano> there might be bugs on this already, hm
[16:57:49] <coldhead> respect yo
[16:57:55] <kba> WebDragon: I'm having a hard time understanding exactly what you're trying to do and why you can't just use pure CSS
[16:58:14] <WebDragon> ajpiano: oh? a known issue? cool. maybe I could submit my fiddle as an example
[16:58:24] <WebDragon> kba: the fiddle explains it quite clearly
[16:58:28] <kba> WebDragon: as far as I can tell, it could be odne using just :focus
[16:58:29] <WebDragon> I wrote it all out
[16:58:43] <WebDragon> kba: widen the css area a LOT, please
[16:59:03] <kba> WebDragon: what about the css area?
[16:59:05] <WebDragon> notice how long (and varied) the different linear-gradient browser-extensions are?
[16:59:14] <WebDragon> one for just about every browser
[16:59:50] <WebDragon> I have NO desire to go back and tweak that several times during development process while PHB changes his mind about the gradient colors
[16:59:51] <ajpiano> WebDragon: that's a mischaracterisation
[17:00:00] <ajpiano> WebDragon: this is what css preprocessors are for
[17:00:03] <WebDragon> just to add a magnifier
[17:00:30] <WebDragon> one more point of convolution that I could solve more easily by tweaking with jquery for a progressive enhancement
[17:00:38] <asidjazz> just blow fire on it
[17:01:15] <WebDragon> I could add a css preprocessor to it which would be one more thing the boss needed to learn as well as me, in this process.
[17:01:22] <WebDragon> it's not needed. overkill just to do this ONE thing
[17:01:32] <ajpiano> it's overkill to handle it in javascript
[17:01:35] <ajpiano> altogether
[17:01:52] <WebDragon> depends on how you look at it. with that messy code In the /31/ fiddle, yes. with the original, not so much
[17:02:01] <WebDragon> and if js is disabled, it goes away, which is fine
[17:02:14] <WebDragon> js is ALSO expanding the width of the thing using css transforms on the fly
[17:02:18] <WebDragon> err not js
[17:02:24] <kba> WebDragon: imo a css preprocessor isn't overkill, doing what yu're doing is overkill
[17:02:26] <WebDragon> there's also css transforms
[17:02:52] <WebDragon> how is adding ONE line of background: "foo", $existingbackground; overkill?
[17:02:59] <WebDragon> O_o
[17:03:15] <ajpiano> because you should just be handling it in css
[17:03:33] <WebDragon> but only if I ALSO use a css preprocessor
[17:03:41] <ajpiano> not necessarily
[17:03:45] <WebDragon> I already HAVE jquery
[17:03:47] <kba> WebDragon: don't pretend to that stupid. The CSS isn't the problem, the JS is.
[17:03:51] <ajpiano> you can just write out the prefixed gradient rules and tweak them if the need arises
[17:03:54] <ajpiano> adding an every-time cost to the userland experience to spare yourself a few css tweaks during dev
[17:03:55] <kba> to be*
[17:03:57] <ajpiano> is a backwards thing to do
[17:04:10] <kba> what ajpiano said
[17:04:14] <WebDragon> ajpiano: until he settles on the gradient colors this is easier
[17:04:23] <WebDragon> I can go do it later when I want to
[17:04:26] <kba> WebDragon: this is easier?
[17:04:30] <WebDragon> I can also do other things with this than just what I did
[17:04:34] <kba> WebDragon: did you not just spend the last 2 hours trying to do this?
[17:04:38] <WebDragon> kba P_P
[17:04:41] <kba> Sure as hell doesn't seem easier to me
[17:04:43] <ajpiano> this doesn't seem easier
[17:04:49] <WebDragon> kba: _ONLY_ Because .css(background) doesn't work everywhere
[17:04:57] <WebDragon> this is _not_ my fault. it worked fine in opera and chrome
[17:05:09] <WebDragon> _exactly_ as I expected it to
[17:05:14] <kba> WebDragon: right, so we should never take unexpected stuff into account when we develop
[17:05:18] <WebDragon> I thought I was done until PHB spotted it failing in FF and IE
[17:05:28] <kba> because the usual develpment process is: write code -> sell to customer
[17:05:31] <ajpiano> WebDragon: don't even bother filing it
[17:05:39] <ajpiano> WebDragon: it's a documented clear case in the API
[17:05:40] <WebDragon> then I ACTUALLY TOOK THE DAMN TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS
[17:05:41] <kba> it's not like we have 20 iterations of debugging
[17:05:46] <ajpiano> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9839
[17:05:54] <WebDragon> LIKE A HELPFUL PERSON WOULD, WHO CARES ABOUT THE COMMUNITY AND WANTED TO GIVE BACK
[17:06:03] <WebDragon> so don't rant on me about spending the extra 2 hours please :P
[17:06:06] <kba> you've had too much coffee
[17:06:17] <WebDragon> and you're feeling a little too antisocial
[17:06:19] <WebDragon> I solved the problem
[17:06:25] <WebDragon> what;s the huhu?
[17:06:34] <kba> WebDragon: just saying - you'd save yourself a lot of trouble (and time) by using a preprocessor
[17:06:42] <kba> ;-)
[17:06:55] <WebDragon> I'd have saved myself a lot more time if .css("background") worked like it should have :P
[17:07:18] <kba> WebDragon: you really don't sound like you've ever developed anything - no offense!
[17:07:21] <WebDragon> http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/
[17:07:33] <kba> you have to take bugs and stupid mistakes into development time
[17:07:38] <kba> they're always there
[17:07:42] <WebDragon> ever tried adding multi-layered background images overlaying something like this generates, kba?
[17:08:00] <kba> never ever has anybody written anything substantional without spending a least a few minutes thinking "hm?"
[17:08:02] <WebDragon> with the boss changing the colors on you while you're trying to work on other things?
[17:08:22] <WebDragon> I did what I had to do, to survive that, so I could spend more time working on other things
[17:08:42] <WebDragon> it wasn't until we noticed that FF failed that we realised there was a problem with it at all
[17:08:56] <WebDragon> "there's more than one way to do it"
[17:09:07] <WebDragon> may be a perl mantra but it doesn't make it any less true.
[17:09:09] <kba> do as you please - I'm just saying it's ignorant to believe that everything just works, because it rarely does
[17:09:14] <lenswipe> http://pastebin.com/NFmFZKXQ
[17:09:20] <lenswipe> how does that look for a query string guys?
[17:09:35] <WebDragon> I'd have had to LEARN how to use a css preprocessor (let alone pick one) before I could have implemented anything with it
[17:09:38] <lenswipe> im getting a 500 so i can only assume that its going wrong somewhere and my controller method is fine...
[17:09:38] <kba> lenswipe: looks about right?
[17:09:42] <lenswipe> kba, interesting...
[17:09:59] <WebDragon> jquery I already knew how to use, I could easily see how to do what I wanted... so what's the problem, man, seriously?
[17:10:06] <asidjazz> kba: is htat js w/ hp?
[17:10:07] <kba> lenswipe: so try to do the submit manually
[17:10:08] <asidjazz> php*
[17:10:16] <WebDragon> IT HELPED ME FIND A BUG
[17:10:20] <asidjazz> w/ fields in data: ?
[17:10:23] <kba> asidjazz: believe it is
[17:10:26] <WebDragon> :D
[17:10:30] <Whirl3d> WebDragon, amen! I have the same issue when replying to "Why not use a plugin" or "template"? UGG
[17:10:34] <asidjazz> thats like welcoming an injection
[17:10:37] <WebDragon> seriously
[17:10:47] <WebDragon> _IT WAS SOLVED_
[17:10:55] <WebDragon> AND THEN THERE WAS A REAL LIVE BUG
[17:11:02] <kba> WebDragon: at some point, you learned jQuery instead of just JavaScript. Perhaps it does payoff to learn new technologies after all ;-)
[17:11:16] <WebDragon> so I killed some time (after hours) working on it so I could report it!
[17:11:29] <WebDragon> why all the hate? :D
[17:11:35] <kba> no hate!
[17:11:39] <WebDragon> :o
[17:11:54] <tw2113> as usual, i have no idea what's going on
[17:11:59] * WebDragon falls off the floor laughing
[17:12:11] * WebDragon passes the carafe of DragonCoffeeâ„¢ over to tw2113 
[17:12:25] * tw2113 points to his beer
[17:13:16] <WebDragon> heh I'm too used to it being morning for some people whenever it's night for me
[17:13:30] * tw2113 won't be able to answer, but looks for people asking about .on() or .delegate()
[17:13:37] <tw2113> those seem to be popular functions to ask about
[17:13:42] <kba> ;-)
[17:13:54] <tw2113> 7pm for me :)
[17:14:01] <kba> 2:13AM here
[17:14:18] <tw2113> jquery is great, but it will never heard to learn straight javascript
[17:14:23] <tw2113> that's all i'll say
[17:14:27] <WebDragon> 8:14 pm here. eating dinner and poking at the problem fiddle
[17:15:00] <kba> WebDragon: http://lesscss.org/ btw
[17:15:15] <smplstk> wee
[17:15:16] * tw2113 needs to find a way to get LESS into client work
[17:15:17] <kba> WebDragon: "Variables" is the headline. On the very first page!
[17:15:20] <WebDragon> one of several things I may take the time to learn one day
[17:15:44] <kba> WebDragon: Come on, that exactly is so copy-pastable for what you're trying to do it
[17:15:49] <tw2113> problem with that is that the next person to come in had better know about it as well
[17:15:49] <WebDragon> but it's something the boss would have to have the time to know too, and since he's a dreamweaver guy ...
[17:15:53] <kba> WebDragon: the learning process is ctrl+c + ctrl+v
[17:16:05] <WebDragon> tw2113: EZACTLY
[17:16:17] <tw2113> which is why i reserve it for my own stuff at the moment
[17:16:19] <kba> I feel sorry for you if you're working with something using dreamweaver... and he's your boss
[17:16:22] <WebDragon> if it was just me I'd say fine, maybe, IF it saved me time in the long run
[17:16:29] <WebDragon> I use vim myself :P
[17:16:37] <tw2113> for the record, LESS can take regular CSS and be just fine
[17:16:43] <kba> no, I meant working with somebody using dmw
[17:17:14] <WebDragon> it;s a two man shop and hes; the boss and uses what he;s familiar with despite my every effort to turn him on to other things (like linux)
[17:17:36] <WebDragon> he;s gotta have adobe Creative suite, and many other tools for print work
[17:17:51] <tw2113> put him on OSX at least
[17:17:56] <WebDragon> so he can share files with clients who hand us website designs as psd and expect us to work the magikz
[17:17:59] <kba> What tw2113 said
[17:18:01] <WebDragon> heh
[17:18:03] <WebDragon> I wish
[17:18:11] <WebDragon> I was a mac head before I went to linux
[17:18:16] <kba> or well, just turn him away from wysiwyg editors at least
[17:18:21] * tw2113 boots into Win7 whenever i need Photoshop
[17:18:35] <WebDragon> he's already got win7
[17:18:49] <WebDragon> and vista on another box
[17:18:53] <WebDragon> and xp on another box
[17:19:03] <WebDragon> and I gots me fedora
[17:19:32] * tw2113 has a new setup. fedora 16 desktop, fedora 15/Win 7 laptop, and iphone 4s mobile
[17:20:22] <tw2113> queef if you're upset by facebook/instagram today
[17:20:50] <kba> doubt it'll make much of a different about how instagram works
[17:20:59] <kba> from what I read, fb isn't going to change much of instagram itself
[17:21:15] <kba> so no reason to weep just yet
[17:21:18] <tw2113> i mostly just wanted to see how many people i could make queef
[17:22:06] <kba> not in posession of a vagina right now I'm afraid
[17:23:33] <tw2113> worth a shot
[17:24:33] <Whirl3d> kba, how do you decide _which_ new thing to learn when you are swamped. There must be a dozen css pre-processors, how do you know which one to invest time in if you don't have time to evaluate them?
[17:24:49] <cbobo> Whirl3d: whatever the client wants first
[17:25:07] <kba> Whirl3d: by reading reviews and doing what's most popular - often times, there's a reason why something is popular
[17:25:23] <tw2113> dozens?
[17:25:24] <Whirl3d> My clients don't know not to use whiteout on their screens. They are attorneys
[17:25:30] * tw2113 has only really heard of LESS/SASS
[17:25:33] <kba> cbobo: so what the clients want - clients never know what they want, and if they do, they're wrong
[17:25:54] <Joan> I'm the sassmaster.
[17:26:00] <tw2113> clients are great at changing their mind easily and quickly
[17:26:13] <tw2113> or showing you shiney things they passed by and demand as "necessary"
[17:26:22] <kba> I just read about less when I saw something about twitter boostrap on HN
[17:26:31] <kba> and less seems to get the job done
[17:26:36] <Whirl3d> kba, Yeah. I hear ya. But I just don't have the time to decipher the latest trends when I am under deadline. I usually just do what Eviltwin or ajpiano says.
[17:27:00] <kba> haha
[17:27:00] <tw2113> observe what paul irish does, and go with that too
[17:27:25] <Whirl3d> tw2113, definitely. But he's all over the place...trying to keep up with him is futile at my age. LOL
[17:27:34] <tw2113> that's why we have twitter
[17:27:50] <Whirl3d> what's that?
[17:27:52] <Whirl3d> lol
[17:27:56] <tw2113> and that you can read on your phone from your rocking chair
[17:28:30] <WebDragon> Whirl3d: amen to that (trying to keep up with paul_irish)
[17:28:58] <WebDragon> I'm almost too damn busy to read the occasional article somewhere
[17:29:14] <tw2113> i kind of like the idea of web standards evangelist
[17:29:22] <Whirl3d> For every article I read, there are five others out there berating me for doing it the other way
[17:29:28] <WebDragon> someone had to do it
[17:29:28] <tw2113> you get to talk about the newest stuff coming out, and get to tinker so you know what you're talking about
[17:29:36] <WebDragon> just to save the rest of us some sanity
[17:29:48] <WebDragon> Whirl3d: LOL no kidding
[17:30:04] <tw2113> instead of client work that you have to drag your feet with because you need to help them retain as many customers as they can squeeze out of a sponge
[17:30:32] <forbiddenjutsu> href="javascript : function()" . how can i determine who owns the function?
[17:30:43] <chovy> anyone hiring for a UI engineer in silicon valley?
[17:30:43] <WebDragon> Whirl3d: and as soon as the site goes public and you're off the case and client pays the bill, THEN there's an update to whatever you used that fixes some catastrophic bug that will take you even MORE time working on client's site to update and test, that you were praying to god you were done with already
[17:31:02] <Whirl3d> I wish I worked in a "team" environment with other folks that had opinions about the best approach to things. Trying to figure it out an your own is treacherous.
[17:31:10] <Whirl3d> WebDragon, you got it.
[17:31:13] <WebDragon> Whirl3d: that's why I come here
[17:31:25] <WebDragon> at least I get some good leads on new stuff I can research when I have the time
[17:31:33] <tw2113> if you had time WebDragon
[17:31:39] <Whirl3d> Of course, I never finish a site, really. I just kludge the shit together when the client is pissed and they love it. Then I run and hide.
[17:31:49] <WebDragon> except that usually by the time I have the time to research, that tech's been left in the dust and superseded by something else I've not yet heard of
[17:32:23] <WebDragon> how many pieces are splinched into html5boilerplate now ?
[17:32:37] <Whirl3d> I have spent about 3 hours _not_ signed in here over the last several months. Great, great information here. The best really.
[17:32:40] <kba> WebDragon: you're being dramatic, learning the basics of LESS takes less than an hour. ;-)
[17:32:50] <WebDragon> kba: and node.js
[17:32:52] <WebDragon> and modernizer
[17:32:55] <WebDragon> and html5.js
[17:32:59] <WebDragon> and so on and so on and so on
[17:33:04] <tw2113> shiv is easy
[17:33:06] <Whirl3d> SASS and SASSY
[17:33:11] <WebDragon> new editors (whatever it was that replaced textmate recently)
[17:33:16] <tw2113> you add it, and IEBumfuck can style new tags
[17:33:24] <tw2113> nothing to learn there
[17:33:40] <tw2113> modernizr is 30 minutes of learning
[17:33:40] <kba> I think you can take an hour of your schedule every week - that ought to keep you up to date with what's important
[17:33:42] <WebDragon> it's just one thing in a string of things
[17:33:52] <kba> and for what you're doing, I don't see a reason to learn node.js
[17:33:54] <tw2113> node is a different beast still
[17:33:54] <WebDragon> I'm NOT saying that any one of these things is terribly difficult
[17:34:11] <tw2113> they're tools, not necessarily the future
[17:34:27] <WebDragon> what I AM saying is that there's an amaztonishing proliferation of things _similar_ to this that are NOT related to js _at all_ that are ALSO part of what I do
[17:34:28] <tw2113> most are fixes for CURRENT issues
[17:34:40] <tw2113> call them bandaids
[17:35:03] <WebDragon> and I have to absorb ALL these changes, not just to html5/css and their various band-aids to get them working on IEclusterF(*&#$&
[17:35:15] <tw2113> stop supporting IE7 and down
[17:35:16] <kba> WebDragon: but what textmate replacement were you talking about btw?
[17:35:23] <tw2113> sublime text
[17:35:27] <tw2113> *thumbs up*
[17:35:36] <kba> better than textmate?
[17:35:42] <tw2113> it is to me
[17:35:45] <WebDragon> and sometimes you just don't have time to learn a new thing to solve a problem when you can already visualise a _fine_ solution using what you already have that wraps up the problem in 5 lines of code
[17:35:51] <tw2113> Sublime works on linux, textmate is OSX only
[17:36:05] <kba> I meant feature-wise
[17:36:12] <WebDragon> particularly when you aren't LOOKING FOR NEW HAMMERS to install screws with
[17:36:17] <Whirl3d> installing now (on win7-64, btw)
[17:36:27] <tw2113> i can't comment much there kba, been over a year since i last touched textmate
[17:36:30] <WebDragon> it's nice to know there's other ways to solve this problem
[17:36:37] <WebDragon> I'll consider it in the future
[17:36:53] <ajpiano> WebDragon: right, but sometimes you need a wrench, and if you don't have one, you can't just go complaining that the hammer doesn't work quite right when you try to use it as one :)
[17:37:00] <WebDragon> but I solved it with what I already had to hand and in the process discovered a bug that I duly intend to report
[17:37:07] <WebDragon> I DO NOT see this as a problem :D
[17:37:08] <ajpiano> WebDragon: i already said not to report the bug
[17:37:16] <ajpiano> it's a known issue and is documented :|
[17:37:27] <WebDragon> ajpiano: what's the trac id ?
[17:37:32] <tw2113> i've heard more people browse mobile than IE6-7 combined
[17:37:37] <WebDragon> it's a _documented_ issue?
[17:37:39] <WebDragon> O_o
[17:37:49] <tw2113> which is why i don't bother with 7 any more, i will if someone complains
[17:37:55] <kba> documented pretty much just means it's written down, WebDragon
[17:37:58] <WebDragon> as in, not likely to ever get fixed?
[17:37:59] <ajpiano> WebDragon: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9839
[17:38:16] <WebDragon> kba:  I was interpreting his frownie as indicative of the status
[17:38:20] <ajpiano> documented as in "shorthand properties are not supported"
[17:38:30] <ajpiano> and it says so in the api documentation
[17:38:32] <WebDragon> bleah that's what I thought you were going to say
[17:38:38] <WebDragon> why does it work in opera/chrome then ? :(
[17:38:39] <tw2113> evening ajpiano
[17:39:03] <ajpiano> WebDragon: that's exactly why it's not supported.
[17:39:07] <WebDragon> if it failed first, I'd have tried other things, but it WORKED first, so .. my expectations were apparently higher
[17:39:09] <ajpiano> it can't be made to work crossbrowser
[17:39:14] <kba> "Sublime Text may be downloaded and evaluated for free, however a license must be purchased for continued use.
[17:39:19] <kba> What's the trial periode?
[17:39:22] <WebDragon> O_O can't be? say it ain't so, Ethel!
[17:39:29] <tw2113> kba from what i'e heard, there isn't a hard limit
[17:39:35] * WebDragon gets out the LART. I'll make it work . mhyuhuhahahah
[17:39:42] <kba> so you can keep using it for as long as you'd like?
[17:39:48] <tw2113> probably
[17:39:56] <kba> sounds like a good deal
[17:40:03] <tw2113> but i found it worth it to pay and get rid of "buy me"
[17:40:12] <tw2113> and you pay per person, not per install
[17:40:39] <Whirl3d> is there a sublime jquery library?
[17:41:04] <tw2113> i believe there is a plugin in there for jquery
[17:41:15] <WebDragon> ajpiano: css(border) property is very different from css(background) due to proliferation of individual-setting background properties with the long string "background" in them fattening up your code
[17:41:35] <ajpiano> how is that different than border
[17:41:55] <tw2113> one is a perimeter guard and the other covers the entire base?
[17:42:11] <kba> tw2113: ok, wow, I like it already.
[17:42:33] <WebDragon> actually the bug doesn't go into much detail on why it's not supported
[17:42:38] <tw2113> did you open the program kba ?
[17:42:49] <tw2113> :D
[17:43:05] <WebDragon> just reports the text mentioned in api.jquery.com
[17:43:24] <kba> tw2113: yeah, but also it has auto-completion like Eclipse which TextMate doesn't. And that sucks ass.
[17:43:24] <WebDragon> I'm curious as to why it works in opera and chrome if it's unsupported :P
[17:43:40] <kba> tw2113: just curious about if it can compile/preview latex and stuff like that
[17:43:46] <tw2113> because opera and chrome are doing their own thing at times?
[17:43:56] <tw2113> dunno, haven't done anything with latex
[17:44:19] <ajpiano> WebDragon: that's the whole point
[17:44:26] <ajpiano> different browsers report different things
[17:44:31] <ajpiano> and we can't reliably normalise it
[17:44:34] <ajpiano> so we don't and haven't ever
[17:44:42] <tw2113> i figured IE would have conditioned us to be used to browsers doing things differently than each other by now
[17:44:57] <ajpiano> WebDragon: here's the original bug http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4295
[17:45:00] <kba> tw2113: can you make it execute a script you're editing? Like, running a PHP file?
[17:45:15] <WebDragon> tw2113:  but this is why I love jquery so much because I DON'T have to normally spell out all this crap just to talk to different browsers
[17:45:21] <WebDragon> :\
[17:45:31] <tw2113> and it's not the silver bullet either
[17:45:35] <WebDragon> it's disappointing to learn there's things that jquery just can't do
[17:45:37] <tw2113> sometimes there will be cases where even jquery can't
[17:45:38] <WebDragon> :P
[17:45:47] <tw2113> dunno kba
[17:45:49] <WebDragon> so I just discovered
[17:45:49] <ajpiano> yeah WebDragon you are falling into a common jquery thought-trab
[17:45:51] <ajpiano> trap*
[17:45:53] <tw2113> i haven't it used it THAT indepth yet
[17:45:55] <WebDragon> ajpiano: :)
[17:46:04] <WebDragon> ajpiano: well at least I'm not alone in this heh
[17:46:07] * tw2113 thought once, it was awesome
[17:46:11] <ajpiano> which is that "jQuery is a cross-browser JavaScript library, therefore, if there exists a difference between browsers, jQuery should fix it"
[17:46:12] <tw2113> euphoria in my head
[17:46:27] <WebDragon> not that jquery _should_ fix it, but that jquery already _had_ bridged it
[17:46:31] <WebDragon> :D
[17:46:54] <WebDragon> _thats_ where I mis-stepped. I never saw that bit in the api pages
[17:47:12] <WebDragon> likely because I never tried to do anything like this before
[17:47:25] <tw2113> welcome to tinkering and exploration
[17:47:34] <ajpiano> which circles back to the original point about not using the right tool for the job :p
[17:48:14] * tw2113 needs to find a way into .Net Magazine other than being quoted for tweets
[17:48:36] <WebDragon> ajpiano: which circles back around to KNOWING That jquery wasn't adequate to the job in the first place
[17:48:48] <tw2113> live and learn
[17:48:52] <WebDragon> which in this case I didn't. because the code DID work at first, EXACTLY as it should have
[17:49:20] <WebDragon> if it had just failed (and you returned null for ALL browsers .css(background) then I would have went HMM and looked at the docs
[17:49:48] <WebDragon> jquery _could_ have (since some browsers fail) failed for all of them consistently
[17:49:59] <tw2113> is it not possible to add some extra lines that fill in the other browsers with a different method?
[17:50:35] <WebDragon> tw2113: the way I thought should have worked: http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/wkSBX/  and the way that actually works: http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/wkSBX/31/
[17:50:52] <WebDragon> it's a bit more .. uh, verbose, shall we say
[17:51:14] <WebDragon> I'd prefer it a bit more laconic
[17:51:27] <WebDragon> jquerys' usually so elegant :)
[17:51:39] <WebDragon> that's the other thing that's apparently occasionally misleading
[17:51:41] <tw2113> *shrug*
[17:52:00] <tw2113> ya know
[17:52:05] <tw2113> i'm looking at that search box
[17:52:09] <tw2113> in firefox
[17:52:18] <tw2113> i see a gradient
[17:52:23] <tw2113> with a magnifying glass
[17:52:28] <WebDragon> and
[17:52:31] <tw2113> and they both vanish when focused
[17:52:35] <WebDragon> correct
[17:52:38] <tw2113> in firefox
[17:52:46] <WebDragon> which it should do in all browsers
[17:53:03] <WebDragon> /31/ works.  the earlier one does not
[17:53:13] <tw2113> oops
[17:53:28] <tw2113> i was looking at the /31/
[17:53:38] <tw2113> the original, yeah it's failing in Firefox 13 still
[17:53:41] <tw2113> nevermind me
[17:53:55] <WebDragon> 'sok. it's late for both of us :)
[17:54:01] <tw2113> i'd settle for verbose to get it to work as desired
[17:54:20] <WebDragon> yeah so would I. I just would have liked it to be more obvious that the shorthand wouldn't
[17:54:27] <WebDragon> .css(background) should warn/error
[17:54:40] <WebDragon> if it's been decided that this is unsupported
[17:54:45] <tw2113> tell that to every browser maker but google and opera
[17:54:46] <tw2113> that's their job
[17:55:03] <tw2113> and who says they wouldn't support it?
[17:55:10] <tw2113> and perhaps they just haven't yet?
[17:55:26] <Arimil> Is there a fucntion in javascript to trim a string down to defined number of characters?
[17:55:28] <WebDragon> until every browser-maker does the right thing in supporting the shorthand, *I* as the programmer would have benefitted if jquery had  warned me under the hood about the problem before I got too far into the code
[17:55:31] <Arimil> i mean jquery
[17:55:39] <WebDragon> when they do support it jquery could be updated
[17:56:01] <ajpiano> WebDragon: if we took that attitude about everything, jquery would be twice as big
[17:56:06] <WebDragon> warning in console would have been nice. not an error :)
[17:56:09] <tw2113> each browser maker has a different idea for "the right thing"
[17:56:15] <WebDragon> too right
[17:56:21] <WebDragon> tis the 90's browser wars all over again
[17:56:27] <WebDragon> I was SO hoping that crap was over with
[17:56:32] <WebDragon> :) no such luck
[17:56:34] <tw2113> except a completely different style of war
[17:56:39] <WebDragon> entirely
[17:56:43] <WebDragon> with all new html
[17:56:45] <WebDragon> and css
[17:57:02] <tw2113> before it was which browser had the best features
[17:57:03] <WebDragon> and a CRAPTON of existing legacy utter S(*&#%(*&T websites that still have to be supported
[17:57:07] <tw2113> now it's which is most standards compliant
[17:57:09] <WebDragon> heh
[17:57:26] <WebDragon> (about time _that_ battle was fought, frankly)
[17:57:44] <WebDragon> never did see full standards compliance for 4.01 strict and css2.1
[17:57:46] <tw2113> you still have to deal with differences the best you can
[17:57:53] <WebDragon> yep
[17:58:00] <forbiddenjutsu> can firebug find the definition of a function for me?
[17:58:01] <tw2113> so stop your bellyaching and go make something
[17:58:03] <WebDragon> and an even longer string of IE versions to support
[17:58:05] <WebDragon> :D
[17:58:16] <WebDragon> hey, I'm off-hours now
[17:58:37] <WebDragon> I gotta blow off steam somehow til the next check comes in and I can go down to the pub and medicate properly
[17:58:37] <tw2113> i'm putting off work bickering with you and reading old pdf copies of .Net magazine
[17:58:53] <WebDragon> LOL not bickering here hahaha
[17:59:07] <tw2113> just accept it, we're bickering
[17:59:11] <WebDragon> I thought this was a conversation the past 4-5 minutes
[17:59:13] <WebDragon> hahah
[17:59:41] <tw2113> with ajpiano the reluctant moderator
[17:59:59] <WebDragon> grandpa would say that fussing is what keeps him vigorous and it's every old person's right to fuss because of that. hahahah
[18:00:12] <WebDragon> anyway, I need a cigarette break anyway
[18:01:04] * WebDragon wonders if anyone configured the channel bot to serve beers
[18:02:22] <jamarki> when writing a plugin that has a method to return a value related to a given element, what do i do in cases when there are multiple elements for a given selector? $(".foo").getSomeValueThatBreaksChaining()
[18:02:58] <ajpiano> the convention is to just return the value of the first one
[18:11:40] <lenswipe> hey guys
[18:11:47] <lenswipe> does $.post expect anything back from the server
[18:12:03] <lenswipe> or to put it another way, why is it reporting a 500 from a method that works perfectly?
[18:13:43] <jamarki> ajpiano: that sounds great
[18:14:43] <someprimetime> ajpiano: you going to speak @ jquery conf SF this year?
[18:15:08] <ajpiano> i don't know
[18:15:18] <ajpiano> but i know the guy who is picking out the talks so we'll see what happens
[18:15:21] <ajpiano> ... it's me.
[18:15:22] <ajpiano> :|
[18:15:28] <jamarki> ajpiano: you might be the perfect person for this question, is there any reason *not* to use the widget factory?
[18:15:41] <ajpiano> jamarki: uhm
[18:16:06] <ajpiano> maybe you like a different pattern better? maybe you don't like all of its conventions?
[18:16:07] <jamarki> i only say that because i was just recently watching your talk on the widget factory
[18:17:07] <fris> is it possible to sort by key with json? im getting data using github api with getjson, right now its just displaying by alphebetical, i want to show by updated date, http://jsfiddle.net/PqAvY/
[18:22:06] <CoolCat2015___> hi. is there anyone here experienced with jquery tools form validation (for ajax post issue)?
[18:30:06] <barraponto> how do i call an object method from a string variable?
[18:30:44] <ajpiano> barraponto: obj[foo]();
[18:30:51] <ajpiano> assuming "foo" is the string of a method
[18:30:53] <ajpiano> on the obj
[18:31:01] <barraponto> i am looking for something like $('#form-element').#{variablemethodname}()
[18:31:21] <barraponto> ajpiano: hmmm
[18:31:40] <ajpiano> barraponto: $("formElement")[variablemethodname]()
[18:34:59] <barraponto> ajpiano: thanks A LOT.
[18:35:19] <barraponto> ajpiano: i guess that's kinda obvious but I just can't wrap my mind around it (yet).
[18:36:30] <ajpiano> anytime you have a function, you can reference it by having it's name, or execute it by putting () and perhaps passing arguments
[18:36:32] <ajpiano> foo, foo()
[18:37:02] <ajpiano> you can reference a property on an object via dot notation obj.foo or bracket notation obj["foo"]
[18:37:28] <ajpiano> if obj["foo"] returns a reference to a function, then you can execute it ()
[18:37:45] <ajpiano> and with bracket notation you can obviously pass a variable instead of a hardcoded string so
[18:37:48] <ajpiano> that's how it all works
[18:46:40] <WebDragon> nifty. glad I stopped to read that all before booting over to windows to do some testing on IE
[18:46:47] <WebDragon> learned somethin new :)
[18:47:28] <WebDragon> new about obj.foo but hadn't really thought of it in terms of obj[variable]()
[18:48:00] <ajpiano> WebDragon: funny
[18:48:10] <ajpiano> i almost showed you an example of that earlier today webdragon but i got sidetracked
[18:48:19] <ajpiano> you could have used that in your next/previous cycler
[18:48:29] <WebDragon> oh really, in the slideshow thingy ?
[18:49:02] <ajpiano> so that you could have just written $(".button").click(function() { var nextOrPrev = $(this)[this.name]();  });
[18:49:29] <WebDragon> hmmmm
[18:49:41] <ajpiano> more of an interesting lesson in how you can approach that problem and DRY out code
[18:49:58] <ajpiano> than like as a Great Ideaâ„¢ for having readable code
[18:49:58] * WebDragon goes to stare at his slidebar code for a bit
[18:50:03] <WebDragon> yeah heh
[18:50:35] <WebDragon> *rummages*
[18:50:47] <ajpiano> it can of course be really useful tho
[18:51:25] <ajpiano> WebDragon: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L174
[18:51:45] <ajpiano> that's how a jquery ui widget is able to make $("foo").slider("value") etc work
[18:51:46] <ajpiano> anyhow
[18:51:54] <ajpiano> i need to shower and leave the computadora
[18:52:00] <WebDragon> I was actually just looking over your discourse/slides on the widget factory and the stuff coming with 1.9
[18:52:31] <WebDragon> ajpiano: thanks. I'll look over my code with that in mind :)
[18:53:34] <ajpiano> everything* you need to learn about you need to know about programming you can learn from just trying to cut down redundant portions of your code
[18:53:58] <ajpiano> not necessarily true but there's a while where that is a very useful thing to keep in mind though
[18:54:09] <ajpiano> alright #jquery have a good night!
[18:54:13] <squantay> hello. i'm looking at http://jqueryboilerplate.com. how would methods added to Plugin.prototype be called?
[18:54:47] <squantay> or is it unintended for multiple methods maybe?
[18:55:55] <ajpiano> squantay: $(this).data("plugin_defaultPluginName").method();
[18:56:17] <ajpiano> squantay: var inst = $(this).data("plugin_defaultPluginName");  inst.method();
[18:56:20] <ajpiano> is how that one works
[18:56:24] <ajpiano> ok seriously i gotta bail sorry
[18:56:29] <squantay> thanks!
[19:03:47] <raj> if I have a 'change' listener for a selectbox...will that be triggered even if I change its value programatically?
[19:27:55] <shoky> helo

[19:53:06] <johnkpaul> I assume google is correct
[20:23:27] <oojacoboo> is there something like .sibling("tr['selected']") ?
[20:45:55] <fotoflo> hmm, using $.Callbacks() i find myself adding them to the document object - is there a reason they shouldn't be global? how would that work?
[20:46:51] <johnkpaul> what do you mean adding them to the document object?
[20:47:19] <johnkpaul> jQuery.Callbacks() returns an callbacks object
[20:48:16] <fotoflo> document.fetchPlaylistCallbacks = $.Callbacks();
[20:48:40] <fotoflo> document.playerReadyCallbacks.add(appendOverlay);
[20:48:55] <johnkpaul> oh, you're adding them to the document's object on purpose?
[20:48:59] <johnkpaul> document object*
[20:49:10] <fotoflo> yes
[20:49:21] <johnkpaul> you can put them wherever you'd like, it doesn't have to be on document, or anywhere else
[20:49:30] <johnkpaul> however you would normally structure your code
[20:49:37] <johnkpaul> ?module
[20:49:40] <bot-t> johnkpaul, QUnit/module - http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit/module

[21:01:26] <lenswipe> hey guys
[21:01:29] <lenswipe> anyone around?
[21:02:16] <yannickoo> good morning guys
[21:02:49] <yannickoo> i've an <ul> with <li>'s now i wanna fadein them randomly, how can i do that?
[21:04:55] <johnkpaul> yannickoo: randomly?
[21:05:10] <yannickoo> johnkpaul: yes, in a randomly order
[21:05:58] <johnkpaul> $("li").each(function(i,el){setTimeout($(el).fadeIn(), getRandomNumber()})
[21:06:54] <yannickoo> johnkpaul:
[21:07:04] <yannickoo> johnkpaul: why u are using el instead of $(this)?
[21:07:27] <yannickoo> johnkpaul: and getRandomNumber() should be a randomized key from all lis
[21:07:39] <shoky> 'el' is more descriptive than 'this'
[21:07:49] <johnkpaul> yannickoo: actually, I should have wrapped the fadeIn with a function(){}
[21:08:01] <johnkpaul> but yes, as shoky says, I would rather use el when it's available
[21:08:06] <johnkpaul> I even use event.target in my event handlers
[21:08:08] <yannickoo> shoky++
[21:08:11] <shoky> ;p
[21:08:14] <johnkpaul> it's a personal perference, I think that it's more readable
[21:08:45] <yannickoo> johnkpaul: shoky: i've this listing here http://zeugs.yannickoo.de/instabums/ and i wanna fade in them randomly
[21:08:48] <johnkpaul> and getRandomNumber() can return any amount of miliseconds
[21:09:23] <yannickoo> johnkpaul: the should appear piece by piece
[21:09:52] <shoky> yannickoo so do what johnkpaul said..
[21:10:21] <yannickoo> shoky: that's not the right way. i also have to check whether the item is already there
[21:10:30] <shoky> what for
[21:10:49] <shoky> and if you think you need to, then go ahead
[21:11:53] <shoky> make sure you understand what johnkpaul's snippet does
[21:12:05] <yannickoo> shoky: but how can i get a random index from the length of all items
[21:12:14] <shoky> you dont need a random index
[21:12:19] <shoky> you want to fade them all in
[21:12:38] <shoky> so you give each one of them a different time for the fadein
[21:12:49] <yannickoo> shoky: yes but getRandomNumber() is difficult
[21:12:58] <shoky> how so
[21:13:08] <yannickoo> shoky: when the first item is faded in the next should come up and so in
[21:13:10] <yannickoo> -in +on
[21:13:37] <shoky> you didnt say that before
[21:13:43] <shoky> are we supposed to guess?
[21:14:12] <yannickoo> shoky: no, sorrx
[21:14:24] <shoky> anyway what's the problem getting a random index?
[21:14:59] <yannickoo> shoky: that i don't know how to check whether the item is already faded in. i built an array with all indexes but it's difficult to remove the key after the fade in from the arra
[21:15:00] <yannickoo> array*
[21:16:13] <coldhead> we've met before, don't be disappointed, holding you is like the new past
[21:16:35] <yannickoo> coldhead: you met me before?"
[21:16:47] <shoky> yannickoo you can pass a callback to .fadeIn() that gets executed when the animation finishes
[21:17:34] <yannickoo> shoky: you think it's okay to have something like an endless loop?!
[21:17:40] <shoky> do you?
[21:17:43] <yannickoo> shoky: or it's a function
[21:18:31] <yannickoo> shoky: $('.item').fadeIn('fast', function() { $(this).randomSibling().fadeIn('fast', function() { ... }); });
[21:19:18] <johnkpaul> :) stepped away for a bit and what's going on?
[21:19:29] <shoky> the callback should check if there are any remaining elements to fade-in
[21:19:40] <shoky> and only if there are, it should call another fadeIn() ..
[21:19:49] <yannickoo> shoky: and then?
[21:20:02] <shoky> and then they all fade in
[21:20:11] <shoky> and then nothing/nil/void
[21:20:15] <yannickoo> shoky: why all? piece by piece
[21:20:21] <shoky> yes, piece by piece
[21:20:23] <shoky> one by one
[21:20:32] <yannickoo> right
[21:20:36] <yannickoo> shoky: but how?
[21:20:47] <shoky> what you wrote is close..
[21:21:21] <shoky> yannickoo you can check the element's opacity to check if its already faded in, for example
[21:21:31] <shoky> if you dont wanna mess with a helper array or anything
[21:21:35] <yannickoo> shoky: my old solution was building an array which holds all the indexes of the items. then i looped over the array and got a random index, after that i removed the item from the array
[21:21:50] <yannickoo> shoky: but that did nothing because i did a $.each(array)
[21:22:06] <yannickoo> so it doesn't matter when i removed sth from array
[21:22:14] <shoky> so dont do $.each
[21:22:21] <shoky> or do $.each after shuffling the array
[21:23:12] <yannickoo> shoky: $.each after every remove?!
[21:23:19] <shoky> no
[21:23:24] <shoky> after shuffling the array.
[21:23:24] <shoky> once.
[21:23:53] <yannickoo> shoky: good idea
[21:24:50] <yannickoo> other question, what's the best way to write a small function in jquery? i've just a function which should add a class to all links. i created a jquery plugin so i call it with $().linkClasses(); is this better that function linkClasses() ?
[21:25:11] <ruby_on_tails> i would use simple functions
[21:25:22] <shoky> no reason for that to be under $.fn
[21:25:34] <shoky> simple function plz
[21:26:12] <yannickoo> shoky: and what is the different between: function foo() and var foo = function() ...
[21:26:22] <shoky> no difference at all
[21:26:26] <shoky> as far as i know
[21:26:54] <ruby_on_tails> there is a difference
[21:27:08] <gnarf> ?101 @yannickoo
[21:27:09] <bot-t> yannickoo, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[21:27:14] <ruby_on_tails> in the second version of the function, you can only call the function after its definition
[21:27:17] <gnarf> function expression vs function statement
[21:27:30] <ruby_on_tails> whereas for function foo(), you can trigger the function even at the top of your script
[21:27:31] <gnarf> also what ruby_on_tails said
[21:27:39] <gnarf> function statements are hoisted
[21:27:43] <gnarf> function expressions are not
[21:28:07] <danzik171> that and the function expression won't be named in stacktraces i believe, unless you do var foo = function foo() {}
[21:28:43] <shoky> really?
[21:29:01] <shoky> nuh uh
[21:29:11] <yannickoo> gnarf++
[21:29:24] <yannickoo> shoky: there are too many ways how to shuffle an array...
[21:35:42] <yannickoo> shoky: $.each(images, function(i,v) {          $('img:nth-child(' + v + ')').fadeIn();        });
[21:36:00] <yannickoo> shoky: that's too fast :s
[21:36:14] <gnarf> ?delay @yannickoo
[21:36:15] <bot-t> yannickoo, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[21:36:25] <gnarf> .delay( i * 250 ).fadeIn()
[21:36:26] <yannickoo> gnarf: index as delay?
[21:36:30] <yannickoo> okay
[21:37:53] <yannickoo> gnarf: but something is wrong, http://zeugs.yannickoo.de/instabums/
[21:38:01] <yannickoo> gnarf: line 91
[21:39:46] <yannickoo> putting the stuff on the a yay
[22:06:38] <Arimil> Anyone know why if (d.getHours() > 11){ is returning false when it's midnight?
[22:07:03] <Arimil> oh
[22:07:05] <Arimil> nvm
[22:07:05] <beancurd> midnight is 00.
[22:07:09] <beancurd> noon is 12
[22:07:10] <Arimil> yeah :\
[22:07:33] <beancurd> :D
[22:08:03] * coldhead takes notes
[22:08:39] * ruby_on_tails burns coldhead's notes
[22:09:18] <coldhead> that was uncalled for
[22:09:34] <coldhead> although you did burn all my notes about what a massive jerk you are, ruby_on_tails
[22:17:28] <kostodo> I'm trying to fire an event when a certain option is selected in a select list
[22:17:38] <abjorn> coldhead: http://i.imgur.com/opIfi.png pppfffttthahahahahahahahaha
[22:17:55] <kostodo> I'm checking the HTML for when I'm changing select items and the "selected" parameter is not being set
[22:18:00] <kostodo> until I submit the form
[22:18:15] <kostodo> but I need the event to fire without submitting the form
[22:18:28] <kostodo> I was trying: var id = $(this).find("option:selected").attr("id");
[22:18:40] <kostodo> but :selected never happens until the form is submitted
[22:25:34] <coldhead> face tat
[22:29:00] <coldhead> oh dear abjsy
[22:29:04] <coldhead> last days
[22:33:57] <crowemi> What happened to jQuery templates?!? What is replacing this feature?
[22:34:52] <coldhead> you can use any of the 300 other template libs, crowemi
[22:35:24] <coldhead> crowemi: http://garann.github.com/template-chooser/
[22:35:39] <coldhead> this one is very popular https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/
[22:35:49] <crowemi> coldhead, thank you
[22:37:14] <crowemi> coldhead, should the old .tmpl() .template() functions still work? I have some older code that still works fine, but I can't seem to replicate it
[22:37:57] <crowemi> coldhead, I'm not sure if its newer version of jQuery or something else that is getting in the way. Either way, I've spent too much time fiddling around with it
[22:38:30] <crowemi> coldhead: I'll check out your suggestions, thank you!
[22:39:01] <coldhead> crowemi: different stuff in jQuery tmpl() seems to break with every new jQ releaes
[22:39:07] <coldhead> you should avoid it
[22:39:11] <coldhead> you'll just get hurt
[22:41:32] <crowemi> coldhead: yeah, thats what I feared. Do you have a recommendation for one that will last? Its pretty crucial
[22:43:11] <crowemi> coldhead: http://garann.github.com/template-chooser/ -- this is $$
[22:46:10] <coldhead> crowemi: any of the ones of github are being actively developed and debugged, it's a matter of taste
[22:46:33] <coldhead> i quite like the one you get with underscore.js and you also get everything else good about underscore
[22:46:43] <coldhead> and that isn't going to disappear any time soon
[22:46:51] <crowemi> coldhead: thanks, I appreciate your help!
[22:56:58] <yannickoo> hello again
[22:57:23] <yannickoo> i've a $.each but this isn't executed when loading new content with ajax. how can i combine .live with .each?
[22:57:38] <yannickoo> $('.instabumbs a').each(function(i) {          images.push(i+1);        });
[22:58:24] <Cork> yannickoo: combind?
[22:58:34] <Cork> what is it your trying to do?
[22:59:32] <yannickoo> Cork: go to http://zeugs.yannickoo.de/instabums/ and then clicking in the right section, you'll see an east-resize arrow, click
[22:59:53] <yannickoo> Cork: then you can try a look in the dev tools (or firebug) you'll see that the opacity is still 0
[23:00:05] <yannickoo> Cork: means that my each loop wasn't executed
[23:01:47] <yannickoo> Cork: did you understand it?
[23:02:20] <Cork> yannickoo: i'm trying to figure out what your trying to do, so give me a min
[23:02:28] <yannickoo> Cork: thanks
[23:04:05] <Cork> yannickoo: the question still is, what is it your trying to do?
[23:04:25] <yannickoo> Cork: doing the $.each even when the new content is loaded via ajax
[23:04:32] <yannickoo> by clicking in the right half of the screen
[23:04:50] <Cork> yannickoo: then you need to run the each loop after you've added the content to the page
[23:05:02] <Cork> each is a loop, it isn't content aware
[23:05:29] <yannickoo> Cork: i do so
[23:05:40] <yannickoo> Cork: but the each isn't executed when i load sth via ajax
[23:06:24] <Cork> uh, no your running it once when the page loads
[23:06:59] <yannickoo> Cork: how can i execute it every time?
[23:07:09] <yannickoo> Cork: ah! let's puttin this in the load callback right?
[23:07:15] <Cork> you need to run it in the callback when you add content
[23:07:18] <Cork> yes
[23:07:27] <yannickoo> can i put functions in $(document).ready()?
[23:07:34] <yannickoo> function foo() {}
[23:07:47] <Cork> yes, but it will only be accessable inside that function
[23:07:52] <yannickoo> ok
[23:08:38] <yannickoo> Cork++
[23:08:42] <yannickoo> Cork++
[23:12:23] <jamescarr> hello
[23:12:36] <jamescarr> what is a good simple way to have a pulsate behavior without bringing in jquery ui?
[23:20:44] <coldhead> jamescarr: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/simple-pulse-plugin-for-jquery/
[23:21:25] <jamescarr> it is not on github anymore
[23:23:08] <Cork> jamescarr: http://jarrodoverson.com/js/plugins/jquery.pulse.js
[23:24:19] <jamescarr> thanks
[23:24:37] <coldhead> #jquery: saving you from having to google things since 2006
[23:25:19] <Arimil> Is anyone here good with regex? :S
[23:25:41] <Cork> ?ask @ Arimil
[23:25:41] <Arimil> http://pastebin.com/HAjFv7Mc is supposed to strip bbcode from text
[23:25:42] <bot-t> Arimil, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:25:44] <Arimil> it however, isn't doing anything
[23:25:50] <Arimil> Cork:  I did
[23:26:56] <Cork> Arimil: your escaping doens't look correct at all
[23:27:25] <Cork> (\[) ([ ^\\ ]) (]*)
[23:27:44] <Cork> i think you meant \[[^\\\]]* right?
[23:28:10] <Cork> same later in the regex
[23:28:39] <Arimil> I'm not sure >.< I spent like 15 mins trying to make that, regex always confused the hell out of me lol.
[23:29:15] <jamescarr> I once parsed a proprietary close captions file format used by a TV Station to produce html content of news broadcasts
[23:29:16] <Arimil> basically I want "[b]awgasdf[/b]" to be "awgasdf"
[23:29:21] <coldhead> Arimil: it's more usual in JS to use a regex literal /like_this/ rather than new Regex('like_this')
[23:29:25] <jamescarr> the parse was a great big huge regex
[23:30:39] <Cork> Arimil: the regex is a bit broken, but from guessing try something like replace(/\[[^\\]]*\]([^\[]*)\[\\[^\]]*\]/g, '');
[23:30:59] <Arimil> xD I've tried messing with regex multiple times but every time I do it's me spending hours trying to do something and then forgetting how it works after it's done.
[23:31:48] <Cork> bah... WRONG... >_>
[23:32:09] <Cork> replace(/\[[^\\\]]*\]([^\[]*)\[\\[^\]]*\]/g, '');
[23:32:15] <Arimil> yeah that also did nothing :< i loathe regex
[23:32:16] <Cork> that should be the right one
[23:32:34] <Cork> Arimil: the problem is you forget to escape \
[23:32:49] <Cork> so when you escape things after a \ charracter its not escaped
[23:32:56] <Cork> and you forgot to escape ] too
[23:33:05] <Arimil> Cork: That also didn't work :\
[23:33:29] <Cork> ?demo @ Arimil
[23:33:30] <bot-t> Arimil, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[23:33:54] <Cork> and preferably the fiddle alternative
[23:34:02] <Cork> it makes it a LOT simpler to fix the regex
[23:34:16] <Arimil> Yeah I'm working on it ^^
[23:34:22] <Arimil> thanks for your help btw
[23:34:52] <Cork> haven't really helped anything yet :)
[23:35:33] <coldhead> Arimil: you are using val() where you should use text()
[23:35:38] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/vScPY/
[23:35:40] <coldhead> that works
[23:38:01] <Arimil> coldhead: thanks
[23:40:22] <Arimil> coldhead: Hm text doesn't work because it's pulling the value from a textarea
[23:40:29] * coldhead np: rodan - tooth fairy retribution manifesto
[23:40:36] <coldhead> oh in that case you DO want val()
[23:40:39] <coldhead> my bad
[23:40:48] <coldhead> #article sounded like a div to me
[23:41:29] <Arimil> ^^ thanks though it works
[23:43:46] <coldhead> what a great result
[23:43:50] <coldhead> good work everyone

[23:59:36] <pif> sure, I can google too, but I'm looking more for informed opinons
[23:59:48] <pif> er, opinions
