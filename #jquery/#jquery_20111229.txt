[00:00:38] <morficus> woozly: http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/  - read the first line
[00:00:47] <morficus> "It operates on a jQuery object representing a set of form elements"
[00:01:33] <morficus> motaka2: and what do you not understand?
[00:01:33] <prabesh> ?trigger
[00:01:38] <prabesh> trigger?
[00:01:45] <morficus> how to popualte the suggestions while they are typing?
[00:02:16] <prabesh> jquery autosuggest
[00:02:57] <motaka2> no, how to understand which editbox is being typed now!(sorry for my english)
[00:03:32] <morficus> do all the input boxes have the same class?
[00:09:46] <morficus> motaka2: paste this into your code and tell me if it helps you understand what you are looking for
[00:09:53] <morficus> $('.location_input').each(function(){ $(this).keyup(function(){ alert($(this).index('input')) }) });
[00:10:12] <morficus> (my assumption is that .location_input is a class that all the input boxes on your page have)
[00:11:17] <motaka2> morficus: yeah lemme paste you some code
[00:11:25] <morficus> !bin
[00:11:32] <morficus> oops, wrong channel
[00:11:52] <morficus> motaka2: pelase use http://jsfiddle.net/
[00:12:36] <motaka2> morficus: let's start from paste bin
[00:15:30] <morficus> motaka2, check it you:  http://jsfiddle.net/Mr3w4/
[00:16:05] <motaka2> morficus: http://pastebin.com/kJBxKc6x
[00:16:45] <morficus> motaka2: I'm not going to do the work for you
[00:16:56] <motaka2> morficus: I know
[00:18:13] <morficus> if you have many boxes on the page and you need to figure out which one is being typed in to.... look at the code I shared on jsfidle
[00:18:17] <morficus> that will do the trick for you
[00:19:11] <morficus> also.. if you have if(0)... that statment will never execute - you know what, right?
[00:19:43] <motaka2> morficus: Yeah , thats PHP , it will just help netbeans with markup
[00:20:03] <pbne04> hai
[00:20:33] <morficus> motaka2: anyways... look at the code I shared on jsfidle (http://jsfiddle.net/Mr3w4/)  you should be able to figure out what you need from that
[00:20:46] <morficus> and on that note... I need to go to bed. so g'night and good luck :-)
[00:22:08] <pbne04> im opening a dialog and want to set the src of an img in the dialog on open..anyone got a clue how to do this? nothing I have tried seems to work - the problem being referencing the dialog img element
[00:25:53] <zabka> hi, somehow strane question... when i send via ajax a post request like var submitString = data + '|' + download + "|" + boxSelectedSymbol;  (which gives for ex. 3m|false|NKTR) what is teh name of parameter? i mean i will have a query looking like http://domain.com/script?3m|false|NKTR
[00:27:03] <motaka2> morficus: thank you good night
[00:29:37] <groklinux> if i want to move a date by a week can i do something like this: currentEndDate.setDate(currentEndDate.getDate() + 7);
[00:32:04] <systemfault> TIAS.
[00:32:07] <systemfault> But yes.
[00:35:23] <groklinux> TIAS?
[00:37:24] <systemfault> Try it and see.
[00:41:21] <groklinux> ahh ok...well, i put it in a simple while loop and when i tried to look at it, it'd bomb out on the first iteration...and i did it so many times that firefox is at 500+ mb brb
[00:59:25] <groklinux> it works fine...the problem was i had only done a var currentEndDate; instead of var currenEndDate = new Date(); ...oops
[00:59:54] <vzsigmond> Question: I have 2 or more connected nested sortables. When I try to sort my inner sortables the sort helper jumps out in the outer sortable on each sort. Is there a way to fix this problem ?
[01:05:05] <vzsigmond> any idea ?
[01:12:30] <alaing> hi ppl
[01:14:40] <alaing> I want to bind a click event that calls a function. the function displays a prompt using ui dialog. The user then clicks a button which calls a mailto href. The only part I'm confused about is calling the mailto href how can i do that within a javascript function
[01:16:07] <AdvoWork> can anyone recommend a table plugin for jquery that can edit the data? and save that/update a db?
[01:16:42] <seutje> whilst curing cancer and solving world hunger
[01:16:49] <alaing> lol
[01:17:14] <seutje> we shall call it jquery.deity.js
[01:17:25] <seutje> it won't have a minified version, obviously
[01:17:26] <alaing> sounds like a plan seutje
[01:17:46] <alaing> i'm sure we could make a minified version
[01:17:51] <groklinux> alaing: i read that as "i want a blind chick"...maybe it's time to put down the coffee lol
[01:18:23] <groklinux> i'd really like to know what sadistic bastard made the decision to make months zero based
[01:18:28] <alaing> groklinux: lol you must of had a great xmas
[01:18:57] <groklinux> it was full of "christmas cheer"
[01:19:37] <alaing> good to hear...so any any idea how to call a mailto href within a function?
[01:21:12] * alaing puts down the Paul Irish Coffee
[01:28:18] <nail_> alaing: window.location = the_href
[01:29:41] <alaing> nail_: thank you much appreciated.
[01:29:48] <nail_> welcome :)
[01:33:02] <groklinux> if i do something like this: currentEndDate = currentStartDate; am i assigning currentEndDate a pointer to currentStartDate and not the values of the object? currendStart/EndDate are Date()
[01:34:28] <groklinux> crap...i think i just answered my own question...i need to do setMonth...setDate etc using gets from currentStartDate don't i?
[01:34:28] <_ikke_> groklinux: The right term is references.
[01:38:36] <nail_> groklinux: objects are assigned by reference, so if you want two distinct copies, you need to currentEndDate = currentStartDate.clone() (is that the question?)
[01:39:13] <groklinux> oh...didn't know about clone...i just got done rewriting it using sets and gets
[02:05:22] <tokam> hello, is there a non google hosted cdn for jquery ui?

[02:45:49] <FleetFox> is there a way to remove html5 validation of form besides removing tags?
[03:12:40] <globe_tmp> hi guys
[03:13:01] <vladikoff> hey globe_tmp
[03:14:52] <globe_tmp> guys i got structure like that http://pastie.org/3089646   , i want to select a label who is insode my main element  'oneForm:bv1'  but this don't wor k var selectedBv  = jQuery("#oneForm\\:bv1").find("label").value;
[03:15:37] <branant> Any idea why this statement would be giving me Unknown Identifier error: $('div#header').animate({padding-top:'220px'}, 500, function() { $(this).addClass('home'); });
[03:16:12] <branant> The error happens around padding-top:'220px'
[03:17:39] <branant> Unexpected Identifier that is.
[03:52:33] <walid> hi everyone! i get a different behaviour according to whether i'm logged in or not
[03:52:41] <zitter> hi, how to identify <input name="Field[foo]"> ? tia
[03:52:48] <walid> using isotope(filtering and sorting)
[03:54:24] <zitter> ok, found! $('input[name="Fied[foo]"]')
[03:56:27] <BinaryKitten> zitter $('input[name=Fied[foo]]') work?
[03:56:46] <zitter> it seems :)
[03:56:58] <BinaryKitten> without the double-quotes i mean zitter
[03:57:01] <vzsigmond> Question: I have 2 or more connected nested sortables. When I try to sort my inner sortables the sort helper jumps out in the outer sortable on each sort. Is there a way to fix this problem ?
[03:57:39] <zitter> BinaryKitten, Uncaught Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [name=Vehicle[driverIs]]
[03:57:53] <zitter> so, it doesn't work
[03:58:00] <BinaryKitten> as i thought, would need escaping
[03:58:09] <zitter> on chrome
[03:58:10] <vzsigmond> zitter you must escape the [ ]
[03:58:29] <BinaryKitten> zitter $('input[name=Fied\[foo\]]') try that
[03:58:55] <zitter> nope
[03:58:59] <vzsigmond> any idea for my problem ?
[03:59:10] <BinaryKitten> double quotes are (aparently) to be avoided.. but if they work in this case.. go for it
[03:59:45] <zitter> :)
[04:00:09] <BinaryKitten> vzsigmond does the nested sortable match the sort items of the parent?
[04:00:09] <bittyx-work> hi all. how do i check if a key is set in an array? (i mostly do php, so i'm not sure if i used the correct js terminology, but i assume you understand my question)
[04:00:47] <vzsigmond> $('input[name=Fied\\[foo\\]]')
[04:01:48] <zitter> vzsigmond, it works
[04:02:09] <zitter> so, which do you suggest? with quotes or double backslashes?
[04:02:19] <BinaryKitten> gah thanks vzsigmond  forgot the double escaping
[04:02:50] <BinaryKitten> zitter go with the quotes
[04:02:59] <BinaryKitten> less chars
[04:05:18] <vzsigmond> the problem is that my sortables are nested and connected at the same time. <div class=´sortable1´><div class=´sortable2´><span class=´element1´></span><span class=´element2´></span></div></div>.  When I try to sort sortable2 the placeholder jumps out in sortable1.
[04:06:12] <zitter> but it doesn't work  if($(this).attr("checked") == true) { where $(this) is input.... it tells me: undefinied. I want to know when it is checked
[04:06:30] <vzsigmond> i tried preventDefaults and stopPropagation... doesnt help.
[04:08:32] <vzsigmond> any idea ? :)
[04:09:48] <hezten> can someone help me out with this small piece of code i have pasted here http://pastebin.com/rCLj2N7b
[04:09:56] <hezten> i works, i just dosnt fadein
[04:10:20] <hezten> cant i call fadeind within the function ? or is there somekind of syntax error ?
[04:12:20] <zitter> ok it works with if($(this).is(":checked") == true)
[04:15:21] <MoTiOnXml> i'd like to fadeTo().remove(), but how do I ensure that remove() is called "when" the fadeTo() completes?
[04:15:38] <MoTiOnXml> (fadeOut()) even
[04:15:45] <MoTiOnXml> ah, callback
[04:17:08] <thyphus> MoTiOnXml: fadeTo(function(){/*when fadeTo is done*/});
[04:17:18] <MoTiOnXml> thyphus: yea, got it - thanks still :)
[04:17:37] <MoTiOnXml> it's the classic queue buildup problem
[04:17:40] <MoTiOnXml> w. async
[04:20:08] <rahmen> Hi! I have the same problem as this guy has: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4021575/jquery-tablesorter-plugin-update-sorting-after-modified-rows The solution is in the comment of the answer. I can see the sortList value if I use console.log($('#thisTable')); But as soon as I log the first element ("console.log($('#thisTable').get(0));") I only get "<table id="thisTable">" and I can't...
[04:20:10] <rahmen> ...expand it and see the sortList value. if I try console.log($('#thisTable').get(0).config) it says undefined... What am I doing wrong?
[04:20:35] <vzsigmond> Any idea how to prevent event propagation of jquery.ui.sortable when I use nested, connected sortables ?
[04:22:20] <BinaryKitten> rahmen use .eq
[04:22:37] <BinaryKitten> .get gets you the dom element, .eq gets you the jQuery object
[04:22:55] <BinaryKitten> though why .config would exist on any of them is a seperate issue
[04:27:22] <AdvoWork> hi there, im trying to use datatables to list data from a php file, my headers are showing its sending the information, and the response and json appear to show the data,but the table is not populating. Any ideas?
[04:44:54] <rahmen> BinaryKitten: console.log($('#thisTable').eq(0)) still gives me an array where 0 is the table I want and has the config variable. But if I do .eq(0)[0] or [0].eq(0) I either get error or the dom element without the config variable...

[04:47:54] <eirikb> Hello. Should not .attr get attributes from the element? I have a textarea but $e.attr('scrollHeight') is undefined, while $e[0].scrollHeight is Number
[04:50:19] <eirikb> Example: http://jsfiddle.net/FgAjR/
[04:50:30] <BinaryKitten> ?.prop @eirikb
[04:50:31] <bot-t> eirikb, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[04:50:41] <eirikb> Ah
[04:50:45] <eirikb> BinaryKitten: Thanks
[04:51:05] <BinaryKitten> eirikb the .attr diverged  now only talks about attributes on the tag
[04:51:38] <eirikb> BinaryKitten: I see, that makes sense. But I guess a lot of people might be relying on the old solution? (attr referring to element properties)
[04:52:22] <BinaryKitten> eirikb for most things that they did that for, it doesn't matter much
[04:52:52] <BinaryKitten> for things like scrollHeight etc where there is no tag, then to move to the new version means modifying the code
[04:53:14] <BinaryKitten> most of the time, i would use .get(0).scrollHeight
[04:53:28] <BinaryKitten> or item.scrollHeight if .each -ing
[04:53:34] <eirikb> BinaryKitten: Yeah I guess. Btw is scrolling to bottom of textarea using $t.scrollTop($t.prop('scrollHeight')); is a valid approach?
[04:53:55] <BinaryKitten> ?.scrollTop
[04:53:55] <bot-t> .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[04:54:04] <eirikb> BinaryKitten: Yeah I have used .get before as well, but using .attr felt better
[04:54:21] <BinaryKitten> .attr only gives you the 1st
[04:54:28] <BinaryKitten> same with .prop
[04:54:33] <eirikb> BinaryKitten: I have seen the documentation of scrollTop, my question still stands
[04:54:35] <BinaryKitten> or any on  a collection
[04:55:02] <BinaryKitten> eirikb i hadn't seen the docs for scrolltop so was reacquainting myself
[04:55:16] <eirikb> BinaryKitten: Ah, sorry :)
[04:55:32] <BinaryKitten> np.. thus the lack of the @eirikb :p
[04:55:52] <AdvoWork> im trying to use jquery and php, my php is returning json_encode() and my json is looking like: http://pastebin.com/c2bRG211 is that valid? its not populating my table for some reason :S
[04:56:09] <BinaryKitten> eirikb that seems a valid approach yes
[04:56:09] <mytoz> Using CATALINA_HOME:   /opt/tomcat6
[04:56:11] <mytoz> oops
[04:56:16] <eirikb> BinaryKitten: Cool. Thanks
[04:56:36] <BinaryKitten> AdvoWork are you sending the right headers back?:
[04:57:03] <muszek> hi... is it possible to see if there are any events bound to an object?
[04:57:20] <BinaryKitten> AdvoWork you will need to send the correct content-type header back otherwise the system thinks you're sending back html and not json
[04:57:21] <AdvoWork> BinaryKitten, how can i tell that?
[04:57:45] <BinaryKitten> AdvoWork in the net tab or console response for the ajax call
[04:57:51] <AdvoWork> BinaryKitten, response headers show: Content-Type	text/html; charset=UTF-8
[04:58:11] <muszek> I want to use a color picker from http://www.digitalmagicpro.com/jPicker/ and need to call a function when user makes a color change...
[04:58:20] <BinaryKitten> AdvoWork plain php header('Content-Type: application/json');
[04:58:31] <BinaryKitten> before any output should fix it

[05:27:13] <erichynds> rahmen: use get() instead of eq()
[05:27:31] <jomofcw> on a hover I want to move an image (absolute in a relative parent) from the left to the right, so I bind the hiver doing and animate({right:0}) and then a animate({left:0}). But it doesn't work because when I do the left:0, right still be to 0. How to reset it to "none" ?
[05:28:09] <rahmen> erichynds: That gives me the dom element only. It's like doing [0].
[05:28:20] <erichynds> isn't that what you want?
[05:31:00] <jomofcw> rahmen : .first()
[05:31:21] <jomofcw> ? .first() @ rahmen
[05:31:21] <bot-t> rahmen, .first(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the first in the set. http://api.jquery.com/first/
[05:31:39] <jomofcw> ? .eq() @ rahmen

[05:34:04] <jomofcw> really I need to know how to "reset/remove" a css properties using animate :/...
[05:35:38] <tokam> I need to fill form elements with example values.
[05:36:08] <tokam> And if the form gets submittet and the value has not yet changed a callback should be called or something is there already a jquery plugin for that?
[05:37:05] <jomofcw> tokam just google for "jquery placeholder"
[05:37:32] <tokam> thx found it
[05:37:35] <jomofcw> tokam more than a jquery plugin there's an HTML5 thing to do it that's call "placeholder".
[05:37:37] <jomofcw> ;)
[05:37:39] <jomofcw> Np =)
[05:42:45] <Web_> hi

[05:45:00] <AdvoWork> anyone know a way to clear a datatables table?
[05:46:21] <Luyt> Could this be done in a more elegant way?  http://jsfiddle.net/Qc7tE/  (Iterating all items in a list, doing something to all items, and treating the one that was clicked in a special way)

[05:53:33] <tokam> what is wrong here?
[05:53:45] <tokam> the values change as expected
[05:54:10] <tokam> sorry
[05:54:15] <tokam> i uploaded the wrong js file shame on me
[06:00:46] <jomofcw> ... what was that tokam :s
[06:01:00] <tokam> :P
[06:01:06] <jomofcw> first of all, the function setExample seems to be never call
[06:01:47] <jomofcw> second : have you check for any syntax error ? FormExample should not be a function but an empty object at start.
[06:02:19] <jomofcw> third : jQuery is chanable, use it ! element.firstMethod().secondMethod().thirdMethod() ...
[06:02:50] <jomofcw> and then, don't use literal to match element, you should find another way to know wich element to target without using '#'+myVar
[06:03:04] <jomofcw> then tokam it will be perfect ^^.
[06:03:55] <tokam> (15:02:20) jomofcw: third : jQuery is chanable, use it ! element.firstMethod().secondMethod().thirdMethod() ... ?????
[06:04:25] <webguynow> I have a couple quick ?'s on jQuery's ajax related methods
[06:04:50] <webguynow> Are the ajax related methods governed by same origin policy  ?
[06:07:15] <webguynow> And, if I'm designing a quick example, can I use a pure-HTML server to serve JSON ?
[06:07:35] <webguynow> I know I will not be able to set the proper mime-type this way
[06:08:19] <webguynow> so I'm wondering (even if I use 'json' dataType)  if the success function will be called ?

[06:19:46] <tokam1> the user presses one of two buttons in a form. how can I check which button was pressed using the jquery onsubmit in the form?
[06:20:04] <tokam1> must i use onclick on the submit button? instead of onsubmit for the form?
[06:21:06] <vzsigmond> I need a workaround to fix jquery nested sortable in this environment:  http://jsfiddle.net/GPMZZ/42/  Any idea ?
[06:21:29] <tokam1> click on the button did not work
[06:24:52] <jomofcw> tokam1 chainable. Really you should learn jQuery basic before anything else...
[06:25:05] <mac> which is faster/preferred: jQuery("img", this); or jQuery(this).find("img");
[06:25:12] <mac> or are they completely equivalent
[06:25:48] <tokam1> jomofcw: you say I should use the click event to register the onsubmit event?
[06:25:52] <xrated> I think both might be equivalent as both limit the scope of the selector mac
[06:25:55] <xrated> I might be wrong though
[06:30:06] <tokam1> works now with onclick
[06:31:11] <Ja-Z> how can i delay the call of .ajax?

[06:32:18] <Ja-Z> because when i do that, i get an error in firebug
[06:32:25] <sveajobb> hi, what's the proper way of redirecting a user to another page via javascript? I have this code, and it works as a charm in case of o.newWindow=true: if (o.newWindow)       window.open('logged_in.jsp?adedit='+o.id);     else document.open('logged_in.jsp?adedit='+o.id);
[06:32:39] <sveajobb> but it fails miserably on plain document.open
[06:32:55] <Eviltwin> window.location = "foobar"
[06:32:57] <gf3> sveajobb: window.location.assign(url)
[06:33:26] <sveajobb> I see, what are the differences between window.location and window.location.assign() ?
[06:34:00] <gf3> sveajobb: none
[06:34:16] <gf3> sveajobb: I like assign because it is more explicit
[06:34:47] <erichynds> Ja-Z: setTimeout
[06:34:48] <sveajobb> gf3, ok :)
[06:34:59] <sveajobb> gf3, Eviltwin Yes! It works as a charm, thanks for your help :)
[06:35:11] <Ja-Z> thought as much erichynds
[06:44:59] <jomofcw> Ja-Z what error ?
[06:45:31] <Ja-Z> $.delay(500).ajax(etc) is not a function
[06:46:41] <jomofcw> Perhaps you can't chain ajax and delay
[06:47:06] <jomofcw> but anyway erichynds +1 : setTimeout ftw
[06:47:15] <erichynds> you can't
[06:47:19] <erichynds> delay only works in between animations
[06:47:33] <jomofcw> "The .delay() method is best for delaying between queued jQuery effects. Because it is limitedâ€”it doesn't, for example, offer a way to cancel the delayâ€”.delay() is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function, which may be more appropriate for certain use cases."
[06:48:30] <jomofcw> Yep it should delay only function in queue
[06:49:13] <Ja-Z> documentation should change to say you can only use it for effects..
[06:50:22] <erichynds> you can use it in between queues, which are mainly for effects, but you can queue up an ajax call if you want
[06:50:56] <xrated> Ja-Z, it's luisted under the effects category.

[07:42:27] <rahmen> jomofcw: Sry for late reply: on the .eq() function jquery API says "Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the .eq() method constructs a new jQuery object from one element within that set. The supplied index identifies the position of this element in the set." Why does it return the same array then? I've tried .eq(0).eq(0).eq(0)...etc and I still get the same result. An...

[07:52:46] <draginx> Is titleMemKeep a legit JS property or is this a webkit only thing? Essentially.. jquery-ui draggable is not holding my element's title attribute.
[07:55:09] <motaka2> Is there a way with which I can show something in an input and set it's value to something else ?
[07:58:43] <jomofcw> rahmen I realluy don't understand what you're trying to do

[08:00:41] <motaka2> why no one doesnt help me?
[08:03:05] <djQuery> motaka2: no not with a standard input. you would need 2 inputs 1 hidden for real value and one for display value. and you arent asking Qs that pertain to jQuery
[08:03:24] <Nilson> hmm, its working in chrome. I bet my firerfox session is just busted.
[08:03:47] <motaka2> djQuery: so how can i create something like google ?
[08:04:13] <atriv> Hi, why is it that once an item is added to the dom via a jquery operation, selecting it using common means doesn't work. i.e. $("#newelem").click(function(){}); doesn't react even though newelem now exists
[08:04:22] <xrated> A few million dollars in VC funding and some very smart people motaka2
[08:04:59] <motaka2> xrated: I meant google suggest
[08:05:15] <xrated> atriv, .click only binds to existing elements. If you want it to effect all elements (even ones created after dom is loaded) uses .on
[08:05:29] <needhaelp> Hello. I hope someone can help me out. I'm not sure this is the right place to ask, but I got here via http://movethewebforward.org/. On that site is a section called jQuery learning site. This links to the jQuery section on Github. My question is, where exactly, on Github, does the learning start? I'm not familiar with Github and all I see are a bunch of unorganized files ... Where and how do I "start"? :S Thank you ..
[08:05:36] <xrated> motaka2: look at jQuery ui autocomplete
[08:05:44] <atriv> xrated, thanks... .on() will handle clicks on that element then?
[08:05:53] <motaka2> xrated: I dont like to use it

[08:06:25] <xrated> atriv: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:06:32] <atriv> thx
[08:06:36] <atriv> will read :)
[08:06:42] <xrated> No worries
[08:06:54] <phlp> motaka2: the suggestion on google isn't actually the value in the input. it is divs positioned over it
[08:07:11] <xrated> motaka2, you can custom roll a jQuery UI release to include only what you need.
[08:10:40] <needhaelp> I'll try again: I got here via http://movethewebforward.org/. On that site is a section called jQuery learning site. This links to the jQuery section on Github. My question is, where exactly, on Github, does the learning start? I'm not familiar with Github and all I see are a bunch of unorganized files ... Where and how do I "start"? :S Thank you ..
[08:10:55] <motaka2> phlp: Is that a good way to do ? I have several edit boxes which need to suggest
[08:11:13] <motaka2> phlp: do you think google apraoch is right for me?
[08:12:54] <djQuery> motaka2: have you looked at see ?ui.autocomplete
[08:12:55] <bot-t> motaka2, The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[08:13:33] <xrated> needhaelp, I don't think the jQuery learning site is done, that jQuery repository seems to be the site itself (learn.jquery.com)
[08:14:35] <needhaelp> ohh, okay. Thought maybe there was a way to get the tutorials and basic stuff going even without that new site. Too bad. Thank you for the answer :-)
[08:15:39] <needhaelp> I mean, there's a lot of files on Github, but I can only get to display them as code, not layouted or anything
[08:16:08] <needhaelp> ... should mention I haven't got a clue about how Github really works
[08:16:53] <djQuery> ?lmgtfy learn git#needhaelp
[08:16:53] <bot-t> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=learn+git%23needhaelp
[08:17:51] <needhaelp> .. okay :/
[08:21:55] <needhaelp> I just don't understand ... I don't want to contribute or modify files, because I got nothing to contribute with. I just want to learn jQuery/javascript. Do I really need to install a program and set up a user for this?
[08:22:19] <xrated> needhaelp, if you don't know javascript, learn it before you do jQuery
[08:22:34] <xrated> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript
[08:22:47] <erichynds> also, see ?101
[08:22:48] <bot-t> also, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[08:23:19] <needhaelp> well, thank you. That's the type of thing I was looking for
[08:23:52] <xrated> After you've got at least a middling understanding of javascript, using jQuery should be much easier needhaelp
[08:24:06] <needhaelp> awesome. Thanks a lot.
[08:25:14] <needhaelp> It's just hard to find "good info". There are a lot of sites, but I don't know how to separate the good ones, from the bad ones. No point in spending time on a site just to find out what you learned wasn't the "correct use" etc.
[08:25:22] <draginx> Anyone know why jquery-ui draggable gets rid of the title attribute once you start dragging?
[08:26:22] <xrated> needhaelp, I understand, mozilla provides good information though and I'm sure erichynds's suggestion is also very credible too.
[08:28:52] <snover> read eloquent javascript
[08:30:04] <needhaelp> On it :-)
[08:30:46] <supsup> might want to read javascript enlightment too afterwards and then javascript the good parts and then http://stage.learn.jquery.com/
[08:32:45] <needhaelp> javascript enlightment and javascript the good parts = books, or?
[08:32:58] <supsup> books
[08:33:03] <Eviltwin> I suggest you see ?learn
[08:33:03] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[08:33:41] <needhaelp> thanks a lot, guys
[08:33:51] <needhaelp> ?learn
[08:33:52] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[08:33:57] <supsup> yah maybe best order is:   mozilla, then eloquent then enlightment then good parts then learn jquery last
[08:34:16] <needhaelp> noted down
[08:34:20] <Eviltwin> supsup: Take a look at what that links to
[08:34:25] <Eviltwin> The Mozilla thing
[08:34:45] <supsup> ahh have not been to mozilla resources in a while.
[08:34:48] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: yo, saw you pinged me
[08:34:52] <Eviltwin> You definitely want to understand intermediate to advanced JavaScript before you get big into jQuery
[08:35:33] <supsup> i'll have to read some of this now ;-0
[08:35:48] <snagnever> hi! i'm having serious issues when selecting multiple checkboxes with a change() event in IE
[08:36:03] <snagnever> it takes a long time IF it have a change event attached;
[08:37:52] <kborchers> ?tell sadmicrowave hey got your message from a couple days ago. let me know if you needed anything or just saying hi
[08:37:52] <bot-t> kborchers, Okay.
[08:38:22] <Eviltwin> He was a sad, sad microwave
[08:38:35] <supsup> why is he sad
[08:38:45] <kborchers> sometimes he's also a saddishwasher on his other computer
[08:39:10] <supsup> like emo house appliances?
[08:39:54] <supsup> any of u use vim when you program ?
[08:40:09] <Eviltwin> I have had to at points
[08:40:15] <Eviltwin> But I normally use emacs
[08:40:29] <xrated> I use vim for quick edits for some stuff, but I normally use Zend Studio
[08:40:29] <Eviltwin> Not because it's better (which it is) but because it's the one I happened to learn
[08:41:24] <supsup> i've always been attached to IDE/graphical text editors....trying to switch to vim full time.  Strategy is to read learning vi/vim book (halfway done) and then read a groovy book and do all the example code in vim.  Not sure if i will switch full time, but figured it won't hurt to be better at vim.
[08:42:15] <xrated> I don't see much of a reason to not use an IDE
[08:42:47] <Eviltwin> Not that vim isn't an IDE
[08:42:55] <omenar> springsource is nice to work with Groovy
[08:42:56] <supsup> yah, was thinking that
[08:43:04] <supsup> i use intellij now ~~
[08:43:29] <Eviltwin> Eww
[08:43:30] <Eviltwin> ;P
[08:43:51] <supsup> i don't know, more curiousity than anything. feel like i'm missing out on something not knowing the lower level (not less powerful in any way) editors
[08:43:54] <xrated> Eviltwin, is js your primary language as a developer
[08:44:12] <Eviltwin> xrated: It's the one I've had to write the most of for work purposes if that's what you mean
[08:44:23] <xrated> more or less I suppose.
[08:44:37] <Eviltwin> I'm really all over the place though
[08:44:45] <Eviltwin> Try to pick the language I think best fits the task
[08:44:56] <supsup> i had too choices...play sthe new star wars mmopg or learn vim/groovy better....i think i made the right choice here ;-0
[08:45:01] <supsup> two*
[08:46:58] <supsup> i mean i guess i could replace the 2nd item with anything really and it would be the better choice heh.
[08:47:28] <supsup> well not like hookers and blow or something.

[09:09:07] <BinaryKitten> hubbl3 try #amplify.js ?
[09:09:30] <hubbl3> People are sleeping on that channel.
[09:10:04] <BinaryKitten> is it jquery related?
[09:10:26] <BinaryKitten> because if not, you're less than likely to get the help you require in here
[09:10:30] <hubbl3> It is, AmplifyJS's ajax requests are base on $.ajax
[09:11:15] <hubbl3> My problem is I can $.ajaxSetup({beforeSend: function() {...}}) on every amplify.request() taht I do
[09:11:18] <BinaryKitten> i thought amplifyJS was a standalone product
[09:11:19] <hubbl3> *can't
[09:13:03] <exnihilo> seems like you don't get a whole lot for moving away from the jquery calls with amplify
[09:14:47] <BrotherRodriguez> morning, everybody

[09:16:57] <dagon666> does jquery natively provide any timers implementation ?
[09:17:05] <tokam1> how to use the checkbox selector on a specific form?
[09:17:06] <tokam1> http://api.jquery.com/checkbox-selector/
[09:17:11] <snover> the code quality is low, the things that it implements have already been done better by others
[09:17:47] <Eviltwin> tokam1: Do you know how to make a CSS selector?
[09:17:49] <exnihilo> imo if you need some of the stuff in there, use backbone
[09:17:59] <tokam1> found something on goole
[09:18:02] <tokam1> hold on a sec please
[09:18:03] <Eviltwin> dagon666: What do you mean>?
[09:18:07] <Eviltwin> ?jsisjs @ dagon666
[09:18:08] <bot-t> dagon666, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[09:18:53] <hubbl3> snover: Thanks for the head's up, might as well search for some alternatives.
[09:20:12] <snover> local storage was done already by lawnchair, pubsub byâ€¦about a million other people, better, request abstraction doesnâ€™t require an entirely separate API
[09:20:51] <tokam1> $('#inboxForm').find(':checkbox').attr('checked', this.checked);
[09:20:53] <tokam1> did not work for me
[09:21:12] <tokam1> must I use children?
[09:21:20] <Eviltwin> That does "this" refer to there
[09:21:29] <Eviltwin> No, find is what you want
[09:21:42] <BinaryKitten> tokam1 before the .attr   you might want to do .not(this)
[09:22:08] <tokam1> ?
[09:22:20] <tokam1> I found the code to set the marker online
[09:22:29] <dagon666> Eviltwin: yeah, silly me, just thought that maybe jquery implements something additionally on top of it
[09:23:19] <tokam1> 'checked' 'checked' works
[09:23:45] <BinaryKitten> tokam1 then go for that
[09:25:49] <mecode> If I have markup like this: <td><span class="some-class"></span></td>, what possibilities is there for adding a surrounding div to the span? so that it'd look like <td><div class="some-wrapper-div"><span class="some-class"></span></div></td>. do i remove everything and then append the div and then add it all back in? or is there something better?

[09:31:24] <dropmouse> anyone had any experience with Selectors not working in IE under "Quirks Mode" Document Mode...

[09:37:49] <VictorCL> I have this element that as click event ,, and inside I have another element with click event .. how can I avoid the second element when being click also call the first element click event?

[09:38:28] <bot-t> VictorCL, event.stopPropagation() – jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[09:39:45] <VictorCL> amazing . thanks
[09:43:21] <VictorCL> another thing , when I click an element that unhides a div .. it automatically selects all texts inside ..  I remember there was a way to avoid this
[09:43:39] <BinaryKitten> preventDefault
[09:45:05] <Eviltwin> VictorCL: see ?g jquery event.preventDefault
[09:45:05] <bot-t> VictorCL, event.preventDefault() – jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[09:45:29] <Eviltwin> Additionally, putting "return false" at the end of your event handler causes both of these things to happen
[09:45:56] <Eviltwin> stopPropagation and preventDefault
[09:47:20] <VictorCL> ok I meant text beign highlighted
[09:47:31] <VictorCL> when I click to make adiv show .. all text is highlighted

[10:18:50] <cybersholt> anybody know of a good jq UI plug that add's pagination to ui tabs?
[10:27:00] <MoTiOnXml> is there a quick way to check if "event" is "over" an element?
[10:27:38] <MoTiOnXml> i.e. if i'm dragging, then having e.g. $("#id"), is there a function to check if the drag-coords are within the boundaries of $("#id")?
[10:27:54] <djQuery> MoTiOnXml: dragenter
[10:28:21] * slashdot1 isn't that a bruce lee movie?
[10:28:57] <djQuery> MoTiOnXml: http://help.dottoro.com/ljccpmjk.php
[10:29:07] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: reading..
[10:29:45] <MoTiOnXml> djinni: i basically want an event each time the user moves the mouse just a pixel when the draggable is inside of a droppable
[10:29:50] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery even
[10:30:11] <MoTiOnXml> dragover
[10:31:05] <djQuery> MoTiOnXml: are you using ui.draggable and ui.droppable?
[10:31:10] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: yes
[10:31:54] <djQuery> think pixel will be a little annoying unless they drag realllly slowly on an 800*600 screen
[10:32:07] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: i'm working with large trees, and when a user drags a node over another node i'm showing a "proxy node" on top of the node, that shows placeholders
[10:32:43] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: i need the fine grainedness to show preceding/below/following pictograms on the hovering node they can drop to
[10:33:01] <djQuery> code? example anything?
[10:33:21] <djQuery> but I dont think you are gonna get pixel precision with anything.
[10:33:37] <MoTiOnXml> well not really pixel precision, but a continous event stream
[10:33:54] <MoTiOnXml> basically i'm looking for something that can tell me when i'm over something and what the coordinates are
[10:34:23] <MoTiOnXml> i can do it low level - was just checking if jQuery has something built in
[10:35:28] <djQuery> have you looked at ui.position
[10:35:55] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: yes, am using it to position the pictograms
[10:36:09] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: will check for other functions
[10:37:39] <Pookz> Can you append an option tag to a select?
[10:37:45] <Pilate> yes
[10:39:20] <interopcop> this doesn't work: $("#software_profiles_*").fadeOut();  So the wild card '*' can't be used in a jquery selector.  How can I do a wildcard?
[10:39:34] <Meekohi> Any recommendations for handling touch events inside jQuery?
[10:39:42] <systemfault> interopcop: attrbute selectors
[10:39:50] <interopcop> i.e. all id's which begin with 'software_profiles_' should fadeOut
[10:40:08] <systemfault> $('[id^=software_profiles_]') iirc
[10:40:42] <interopcop> all right I'll try that
[10:41:04] <Meekohi> Related: Is there a difference between .addEventListener() and jQuery's .bind() ?
[10:41:45] <MoTiOnXml> hmm, can't provide a jQuery object to droppable as "accept"
[10:41:51] <MoTiOnXml> what a shame :/
[10:42:49] <systemfault> Meekohi: addEventListening is a DOM method, not a jquery one.
[10:43:12] <Meekohi> systemfault: Right, but don't they effectively do the same thing?
[10:43:18] <systemfault> Meekohi: The problem is that it doesn't work on older browsers like IE7-8. etc..
[10:43:25] <Meekohi> systemfault: Ahhh I see.
[10:43:30] <systemfault> Meekohi: That's the reason why bind exists.
[10:43:43] <systemfault> "as a way to normalize event handling
[10:43:55] <systemfault> And bind is sooo 2010
[10:44:04] <systemfault> .on is the cool thing
[10:45:04] <Meekohi> So cool, so cool. I don't quite get it though.
[10:45:15] <systemfault> Meekohi: Don't get what?
[10:45:19] <systemfault> .bind?
[10:45:31] <Meekohi> .on
[10:45:58] <systemfault> Ahh.. It's a method that does everything .bind/live/delegate do
[10:46:07] <ajpiano> Meekohi: .on is just traditional 'bind' but with syntactic sugar for event delegation
[10:46:21] <Meekohi> Ahh okay. bind() will do for now ;D
[10:46:31] <systemfault> on!!!! :/
[10:46:43] <systemfault> 2 letters less!
[10:46:44] <ajpiano> just use .on, .bind is nothing but a shortcut to it in 1.7
[10:46:52] <systemfault> Optimization!
[10:46:56] <systemfault> j/k
[10:47:23] <Meekohi> New syntax makes sad panda, but okay I will learn.
[10:47:45] <Meekohi> Ahh nevermind nevermind I see now, I misunderstood.
[10:48:48] <hubbl3> for every on() you write, people in africa are rejoicing.
[10:49:04] <Meekohi> What do people do about debugging touch events?
[10:49:26] <systemfault> Meekohi: foo.bind('click', function() {}); becomes foo.bind('click', function() {});
[10:50:01] <Meekohi> .on but yeah I get it systemfault ;)
[10:50:23] <systemfault> Err :/ yeah..
[10:50:27] * systemfault hides
[10:50:34] <snagnever> hey! iam having problem with a checkbox
[10:50:48] <Pilate> have you tried talking it out with him first
[10:50:53] <snagnever> that its NOT checked but jquery says it is
[10:51:04] <systemfault> snagnever: hit it with a baseball bat with nails.
[10:51:20] <snagnever> i've tried, with no success
[10:51:23] <systemfault> (Or write a testcase.. give us a url or something)
[10:51:35] <snagnever> a sec
[10:54:14] <snagnever> systemfault http://fundosafundo.com.br/v2/fundos/ranking.html#
[10:54:25] <snagnever> the checkbox inside the accordion header
[10:55:27] <snagnever> it's never checked but it aways says it is
[11:00:32] <systemfault> snagnever: There's so much stuff on that page... I wouldn't know where to start
[11:04:56] <pythonirc101> Is there a jquery way to show my user that the server is busy (an animation please)? Then turn off the animation when the server is done
[11:05:58] <snagnever> systemfault solved by modifying the 'ui' plugin that i was using... thnaks ;]
[11:06:07] <snagnever> pythonirc101 depens on where it's loading
[11:06:15] <Wizek> hi there
[11:06:22] <Wizek> Is there any jquery developers here?
[11:06:41] <Wizek> I mean, someone who contributed to the framework itself
[11:06:46] <pythonirc101> snagnever: I just need it to show a spinner
[11:06:50] <pythonirc101> or some busy animation
[11:07:49] <snagnever> pythonirc101 but WHAT is loading?
[11:08:07] <pythonirc101> Preferably, I would like to turn <input type="submit" value="submit" /> into a busy animation. When I'm done, turn it back to submit button
[11:08:18] <pythonirc101> a large computation in the backend is happening
[11:10:07] <snagnever> are you submiting to an iframe?
[11:10:13] <bartmax> pythonirc101: i think you can disabled the form $('form').submit(function() {$(this).attr('disabled', 'disabled')});
[11:10:24] <bartmax> and also the buttons
[11:10:28] <bartmax> also hidding the buttons
[11:10:35] <bartmax> and also showing an animation
[11:10:45] <bartmax> all in $('form').submit event
[11:10:48] <bartmax> onComplete
[11:11:02] <bartmax> onError, onWhatever restore everything back
[11:11:37] <pythonirc101> bartmax: I call greeting right now--> <form name="vform" action="./" onsubmit="return greeting()">
[11:12:19] <bartmax> $('form').submit(function() {disableForm(); return greeting()});
[11:12:34] <bartmax> pythonirc101: i suggest not use onsubmit attr on form
[11:12:40] <bartmax> instead unobstrusive
[11:19:52] <jqueryyunowork> why does the css() function not properly change the css 'left' variable in this code?    ->    $("#box"+numm).css("left",'600px');    alert($("#box"+numm).css("left"));
[11:20:27] <atriv> is anyone familiar with twitter's bootstrap framework? i can't for the life of me select buttons inside a popover div
[11:20:34] <atriv> im thinking i have to use .on()
[11:20:46] <atriv> but the elements exist right off the bat
[11:20:49] <Meekohi> What do people use for debugging multitouch event handlers? Anyway to simulate that? I tried "phantomlimb" but it doesn't seem to work.
[11:20:54] <atriv> so i think i shouldn't need to
[11:26:16] <atriv> i can select the element in chrome's console $("#ack")
[11:26:24] <atriv> but if i attach .click() to it
[11:26:26] <atriv> nothing happens
[11:28:44] <atriv> i've verified that the action is registered to that element
[11:28:46] <atriv> still nothing
[11:29:22] <MoTiOnXml> i can't get my droppable.over to work
[11:29:28] <MoTiOnXml> it's like it doesn't like me
[11:29:41] <MoTiOnXml> i'm sure the accept: id is in the DOM
[11:29:45] <MoTiOnXml> i.e the draggable
[11:33:26] <Wizek> Are there any jQuery contributors around?
[11:33:33] <ajpiano> Wizek: what's up
[11:33:56] <jqueryyunowork> y no work?     $("#box"+numm).css("left",'600px');    alert($("#box"+numm).css("left"));
[11:34:12] <jqueryyunowork> it is possible to set the CSS value of 'left' via .css() function, no?
[11:34:18] <Wizek> ajpiano, Can you tell me about your workflow?
[11:34:47] <Wizek> ajpiano, I'm most interested in the part when you code a little and want to test out the changes
[11:35:01] <ajpiano> are you asking how one who wants to contribute to jquery core goes about contributing a patch, or the big-picture workflow of how features are added to jquery etc etc
[11:35:01] <ajpiano> ok
[11:35:07] <magicblaze007> If I use this to replace a form selector.replaceWith( content ) -- how can i get back the original dom?
[11:35:36] <ajpiano> Wizek: http://weblog.bocoup.com/javascript-jquery-bug-fixing-guide
[11:38:14] <tomorama> Not much activity in #jquerymobile, thought I'd ask here. I want close close all dialogs, however $(".ui-dialog").dialog("close"); only closes the topmost one. I also tried $("#dialog1, #dialog2").dialog("close"); however that also only closed the topmost dialog (2)
[11:38:52] <tomorama> There aren't any errors in the js console
[11:39:13] <ajpiano> tomorama: $(".ui-dialog").each(function() { $(this).dialog("close"); });
[11:40:20] <tomorama> ajpiano: Same effect. Only the topmost dialog closed.
[11:40:28] <Meekohi> I'm a little stumped. The touch events my widget is receiving don't have a touches element.
[11:40:46] <TehRabbitt> okay, i was in here brifely yesterday trying to figure something out but i was never able to implement it correctly
[11:41:07] <ajpiano> tomorama: that's bizare :/
[11:41:27] <TehRabbitt> i'm trying to use onclick, to perform certain things when a submit button on a page is pressed, but it's not working correctly...
[11:41:51] <TehRabbitt> I know someone got it to work in jfiddle yesterday / it worked great in the example, but on my actual page, when I tried it, it didn't work at all
[11:41:58] <jqueryyunowork> no one can tell me why .css("left", "900px"); does not set left to 900px?
[11:42:33] <TehRabbitt> I will post my entire code in a few seconds.
[11:42:38] <talntid> having trouble finding a simple tutorial (jquery noob here) on how to load the contents of a webpage into a variable....  (webpage is local)
[11:42:51] <talntid> basically, I want to load the results of blah.php into a variable..
[11:45:00] <Meekohi> Bah. It's in event.originalEvent, since that makes sense.
[11:45:30] <TehRabbitt> http://paste.debian.net/150499/
[11:45:33] <TehRabbitt> thats the code
[11:45:53] <ajpiano> jqueryyunowork: it does work, http://jsfiddle.net/uaEL7/
[11:46:31] <TehRabbitt> and this is the HTML part that i'm tryign to use the onclick against: http://paste.debian.net/150500/
[11:47:38] <TehRabbitt> any ideas on how I would do it correctly?
[11:47:50] <TehRabbitt> this is the last thing I really need to get working before the whole thing just "works"
[11:48:00] <TehRabbitt> just geting it to run the code onclick()
[11:48:47] <ajpiano> TehRabbitt: i assume someone in here already told you about how onclick is bad and stuff?
[11:49:54] <mattp_> is it faster to use $(this).children('selected').removeClass('selected') or $(this).children().removeClass('selected')?
[11:50:03] <TehRabbitt> ajpiano: is there an alternative to running my script when the submit button on a page is pressed in order for my code to pass the information into the DYMO JS Library to print a label via a label printer
[11:50:13] <TehRabbitt> I have everything else working finally
[11:50:25] <TehRabbitt> except the actual intercepting the form being submitted
[11:50:36] <ajpiano> TehRabbitt: yes, $("form").submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault();  DYMO.printLabel("hi");  });
[11:51:05] <TehRabbitt> ajpiano: where would that go into my code though?
[11:51:21] <ajpiano> inside of your onload
[11:51:28] <poppiez> what does it mean when you do $(document).bind('touchmove', function() { return true; });?
[11:51:51] <poppiez> specifically the return true; statement
[11:53:04] <TehRabbitt> ajpiano: nada
[11:53:40] <magicblaze007> I've a div element http://paste.pocoo.org/show/527456/ -- I would like to write something below this element, so that when i use ().hide() in jquery, I can see the bottom layer. Is this possible?
[11:54:18] <ajpiano> TehRabbitt: what do you mean, how do you know the code isn't working, etc
[11:54:48] <TehRabbitt> as in it didn't print
[11:55:52] <TehRabbitt> var printButton = document.getElementById('printButton');
[11:55:52] <TehRabbitt> auditLaptop:printButton.onclick = function()  {	
[11:56:02] <TehRabbitt> that worked... but ONLY if I specify it statically
[11:56:22] <djQuery> MoTiOnXml: did you get it squared away
[11:56:29] <TehRabbitt> ermm one sec
[11:56:40] <TehRabbitt> var printButton = document.getElementById('laptopAudit:printButton');
[11:57:10] <TehRabbitt> problem is that the first part of the ID changes
[11:57:54] <ajpiano> TehRabbitt: obviously, my code wouldn't print anything, i have no idea how the DYNO js library works
[11:58:05] <ajpiano> the point is, that's how you intercept a form submit
[11:58:23] <atriv> if i have a dom element with the attribute value="x" how could i retrieve that value if i have the dom element selected?
[11:58:28] <TehRabbitt> oh
[11:58:47] <ajpiano> atriv: is it a form control ?
[11:58:52] <ajpiano> use see ?val
[11:58:53] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[11:59:03] <atriv> no its a <tr> element
[11:59:15] <ajpiano> oh cause those have value attrs and all that
[11:59:19] <ajpiano> .attr("value')
[11:59:20] <ajpiano> :/
[11:59:22] <atriv> i have <tr value="x"><>
[11:59:28] <atriv> perfect
[11:59:30] <atriv> gracias
[11:59:34] <ajpiano> de nada
[12:00:00] <talntid> having trouble finding a simple tutorial (jquery noob here) on how to load the contents of a webpage into a variable....  (webpage is local) Ideas?
[12:01:30] <BrotherRodriguez> talntid http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[12:01:34] <Meekohi> talntid: use $.get() and have the success handler dump it into a variable. Remember it won't be available until after the AJAX request returned though.
[12:02:08] <TehRabbitt> ajpiano: hm well is there an easy way to use getElementByID or something that can ignore everything before the colon?
[12:02:14] <TehRabbitt> because this does work: 		var printButton = document.getElementById('auditLaptop:printButton');
[12:02:21] <TehRabbitt> but only on the auditLaptop page
[12:02:34] <ajpiano> ?attributeStartsWith @ TehRabbitt
[12:02:35] <bot-t> TehRabbitt, [attribute^="value"]: Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value beginning exactly with a given string. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[12:02:51] <ajpiano> TehRabbitt: it makes SO MUCH MORE SENSE to just capture the submit on the form, on every page
[12:03:02] <ajpiano> instead of dynamically finding the right id and getting a click on it
[12:03:25] <ajpiano> when you want to intercept a form being submit, the form's submit is the right and proper event to use, not the click of the submit button
[12:04:03] <TehRabbitt> ajpiano: well the attribute ends with printButton on every page, it's the beginning that changes
[12:04:13] <ajpiano> ?attributeendswith
[12:04:14] <bot-t> [attribute$="value"]: Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value ending exactly with a given string. The comparison is case sensitive. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-ends-with-selector/
[12:04:23] <ajpiano> TehRabbitt: the point here, fyi, is to teach you to fish
[12:04:31] <ajpiano> not just hand you a trout
[12:05:09] <TehRabbitt> ajpiano: ah didn't know there was an ends with
[12:05:11] <TehRabbitt> hm
[12:11:30] <djQuery> ajpiano: doing $('form').submit(function(e){})   is there anyway to get what the item that triggered the submit event was?
[12:12:10] <djQuery> looking at e in debgger and I cant see anythign that would indicate that
[12:13:44] <djQuery> e.srcElement is just the form element not the input in the form that input that triggered the submit
[12:13:49] <jacobrask> When I use 1.7.1 'on' with a selector filtering, I get multiple click events. $('#files').on('click', 'a', ..  in a nested list gives as many click events as the depth of the nesting or something. $('#files a').on('click', ..  works as expected
[12:14:13] <jacobrask> the target is the same element for each event
[12:15:00] <djQuery> e.originalEven also reference the form not the input
[12:15:12] <jacobrask> they're exact duplicates actually as they are even grouped in WebKits console
[12:16:15] <djQuery> jacobrask: $('#files').on('click', 'a', function(e){ e.stopPropogation(); })
[12:16:52] <djQuery> ?stoppropogation@jacobrask
[12:16:53] <bot-t> jacobrask, event.stopPropagation() - This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[12:17:02] <jacobrask> ah.
[12:17:03] <jacobrask> thanks
[12:17:27] <Mkop> is the following an anti-pattern?
[12:17:56] <Mkop> $(div).bind('dialogclose',function() {
[12:17:56] <Mkop> });
[12:18:05] <Mkop> uh oh, weird....
[12:18:08] <Mkop> it displayed wrong
[12:18:20] <Mkop> ok fine I'll pastebin
[12:18:33] <djQuery> Mkop: jsfiddle would be beter
[12:19:17] <Mkop> I'll just ask in prose :-). is it bad to, in the code for an event handler, unbind the given handler?
[12:20:16] <djQuery> Mkop: so your trying to get it to fire just once by unbinding itself whenever its triggered
[12:20:20] <ajpiano> Mkop: it's not crazy, but there's also .one() for that
[12:20:20] <Mkop> yes
[12:20:28] <djQuery> I have to ask are you useing ui.dialog for this?
[12:20:41] <Mkop> yes
[12:20:55] <djQuery> if so it will unbind automagicaly when you call destroy on it
[12:21:01] <Tomas--> hello folks
[12:21:20] <ajpiano> Mkop: see ?one
[12:21:21] <bot-t> Mkop, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[12:21:31] <Mkop> currently I've been opening/closing the dialog with open/close instead of destroying
[12:22:21] <djQuery> and it would be better if you did    $('div').dialog({dialogClose: function(){whatever here }, otheroptions.....})
[12:22:52] <Tomas--> got a question: will there be any ramifications for having a multiple (could be as many as 20) hiddens divs with content in a page with which one is shown based on a cookie value? What sort of effect on load time?
[12:22:53] <imsky> holla at me baby
[12:22:53] <BFranks> wow.. HTML5's date picker ROCKs on JQuery's .. how do I avoid Opera users getting this situation: http://i.imgur.com/L2KBU.png ?
[12:22:54] <bot-t> (17 hours 40 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRMMUC2XVpg
[12:23:45] <progrock`> whoever was behind the new event stuff in 1.7.. specifically the delegation ability with on.. THANK YOU!! lol.. was about to code a plugin to accomplish the same shit (only mine would have been 3 times slower likely)
[12:23:46] <djQuery> best to just test it. but whatever you dont have to send down to the browser is allways better than hidding something
[12:23:56] <Tomas--> ok
[12:24:03] <cybersholt> anybody know how to make a button inside a jq ui tab from json?
[12:24:11] <ajpiano> TehRabbitt: here is a way of tracking the submitting button and using it in the submit http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/ac9Lc/2/
[12:24:19] <Tomas--> I may just build out whatever div I need on load
[12:24:25] <djQuery> BFranks: what browser is that?
[12:24:50] <Tomas--> hidden divs was just easier
[12:24:55] <djQuery> cybersholt: yes I am sure someone knows
[12:25:29] <cybersholt> thanks dj
[12:25:35] <BFranks> dQuery: Opera
[12:27:18] <djQuery> BFranks: the best thing you could do is detect wether or not the browser has support for the datapicker and not bind the ui.datepicker in the case that the browser supports it. as far as I know opera is the only one that does, well unless your talking about phone browsers
[12:27:57] <djQuery> BFranks: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-conditional-datepicker-on-opera-browser
[12:31:48] <Mkop> what's the difference between .one() vs .bind(...,function() {//stuff; $(this).unbind('...')}? Are they functionally the same?
[12:32:31] <Mkop> I guess .one is finer-grained since I know that .unbind will not have any collateral effects
[12:33:04] <dabear> Mkop: your assumption is correct
[12:33:33] <dabear> .one is just a .bind that unbins it self after all the handlers are run the first time
[12:33:55] <Mkop> oh, ok
[12:33:56] <dabear> Mkop: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.js
[12:34:00] <dabear> search for if ( one === 1 ) {
[12:34:12] <dabear> and you see how it's done in the current version
[12:37:03] <Mkop> I don't completely follow the code, but thanks
[12:37:36] <Mkop> no need to delve into jquery internals right now. I'm content being an user of the library at this point
[12:38:39] <dabear> Mkop: sure, but you asked so I answered :)
[12:39:03] <Mkop> as I said, thanks. the last line was mostly apologetics. :-)
[12:39:12] <Hounddog_> hi, i am trying to modify the superfish menu a little... i am using the nav-bar example and want the menu to fade in and also try to let the color on the first lvl kind of slide up... does anyone have any hints where i can find informaion on how to do this?
[12:39:36] <Mkop> the thanks was heartfelt. thanks for introducing me to a new realm, that I'd love to understand one day that isn't today :-)
[12:40:22] <Hounddog_> or if someone knows a better menu to do this...
[12:41:02] <Hounddog_> actually even thinking if i just do it myself... might be easier then modifying the superfish
[12:44:10] <Hounddog_> propably best to just align everything by css and then apply the effects
[12:50:59] <x-ip> hi, i'm really new with javascript and here goes my question heh :) I'm using the progress bar from JQuery UI and i do an ajax request (using jquery again) to an url from a webservice that will take some time to return. What i want to do, is to increase the progressbar while i wait for the webservice url to return
[12:52:16] <x-ip> i can get the progress calling another webservice url, so ... how can i fire the ajax request without get me blocked ? :)
[12:52:59] <x-ip> any sample code or hint point is more than welcome :)
[12:53:15] * x-ip is watching jquery deferreds
[12:53:49] <TehRabbitt> ajpiano: hey, sorry back
[12:53:55] <TehRabbitt> ajpiano: would soemthing like this work? 		var printButton = $("submit[id*=printButton]");
[12:54:06] <ajpiano> i sent you a working example
[12:54:07] <ajpiano> no
[12:54:10] <ajpiano> that will not
[12:54:32] <Hounddog_> am just looking at animate... is it possible to just let the background sort of slide in?
[12:54:52] <TehRabbitt> ajpiano: so i'd basically have to rewrite in order for it to work?  aka I can't use printButton.onclick = function()?
[12:55:18] <ajpiano> you can but you won't have access to be able to cancel a submit event inside of a click event
[12:55:18] <Mkop> x-ip: I don't think you should need deferreds. just fire off an event every interval that checks the status and updates the progress bar
[12:56:20] <TehRabbitt> what do you mean cancel a submit event?
[12:57:14] <ajpiano> TehRabbitt: i mean that im assuming you want to cancel the default submit behaviour of posting to another page and replace it with some call to something else?
[12:57:17] <ajpiano> but i might be assuming that wrong
[12:57:19] <x-ip> Mkop, thanks for your answer, thats exactly what i want to do but ... i dont know how ... here is my code: http://pastebin.com/2VswVeaB
[12:57:29] <TehRabbitt> ajpiano: No no... I want to basically piggyback on it...
[12:57:39] <ajpiano> you can still use the submit event
[12:58:15] <TehRabbitt> ajpiano: Right now, when someone clicks submit, it posts the data from the form into a JSF file which sends it off to SQL...  I do not want to interfere with that.. all I want to do is grab the data from those form fields and print a label as it saves the form to the DB
[12:58:26] <TehRabbitt> I have it working, if I set printButton manually
[12:58:27] <x-ip> for example, how can i call a function and let the function 'run in background' in the line 2 ?
[12:58:31] <Mkop> x-ip: is /getpkg the thing that returns status, or the slow thing that actually gets the data?
[12:58:38] <ajpiano> so just... do that in the submit event
[12:58:42] <ajpiano> i don't understand why it's so complicated
[12:58:44] <ajpiano> of the form
[12:58:47] <x-ip> Mkop, the slow thing that will take some time to return
[12:59:02] <TehRabbitt> so replace what I had with the $("form") code you sent?
[12:59:23] <ajpiano> if you want to desperately do it with the click event you can do $("[id$='printButton']").click(function() { });
[12:59:46] <ajpiano> i'm not going to make any guarantees about whether or not my code that i wrote to illustrate a concept will magically work perfectly in your application
[13:00:16] <TehRabbitt> lol nor would I expect it to... but Its something to look at hm... I just can't seem to get form to recognize the button
[13:00:32] <ajpiano> that's cause your selector lookd pretty wrong
[13:00:37] <Mkop> x-ip: so do it as two requests. $.ajax(...'/getpkgs'); setInterval(function() {$.ajax('/status',...success:function() {//update progressbar})},5000);
[13:00:56] <ajpiano> $("submit[id*=printButton]"); will not work, there is no such element type as 'submit'
[13:01:27] <MoTiOnXml> how come setting $(obj).prop("data-position", "top") doesn't affect the rendering when i've got a CSS style that covers obj[data-position=top]?
[13:01:35] <MoTiOnXml> isn't prop() supposed to work just like setting class-names?
[13:01:56] <MoTiOnXml> i was expecting the browser to reflect the changes in the DOM and match the selector
[13:01:59] <ajpiano> MoTiOnXml: properties are not attributes, you can't style things by their properties
[13:02:12] <MoTiOnXml> ajpiano: i tried using attr() as well, to no avail
[13:02:23] <ajpiano> you also should be creating random custom properties with prop
[13:02:31] <ajpiano> MoTiOnXml: what's wrong with classes
[13:02:32] <ajpiano> :/
[13:02:49] <MoTiOnXml> i'd like to use different selectors based on the value of an attribute
[13:03:07] <Mkop> use namespaced classes
[13:03:23] <MoTiOnXml> no, it's not helping i think
[13:03:34] <MoTiOnXml> so like class="top | right | bottom" is easier to change if i need to set the value of an attribute
[13:03:47] <MoTiOnXml> like data-position="top | right | bottom"
[13:03:56] <Mkop> instead of .prop('data-position','top'), do .addClass('data-position-top')
[13:04:05] <TehRabbitt> ajpiano: got form working :-D
[13:04:13] <x-ip> Mkop, sorry, i couldnt understand your answer :S ... if i call first $.ajax(...'/getpkgs'); and then another function that every 'n' time asks the status, i'll not get stucked until $.ajax(..'/getpkgs') finish ? maybe this pastebin helps, i added a comment: http://pastebin.com/Edcq5y8Q
[13:04:15] <MoTiOnXml> Mkop: thing is i'll have to remove the class again
[13:04:19] <TehRabbitt> you are the best.... seriously,... I had to change a few thigns here / there but it works now
[13:04:20] <MoTiOnXml> Mkop: so not much help
[13:04:26] <TehRabbitt> thank you thank you thank you
[13:04:38] <Mkop> MoTiOnXml: ok, so remove the class.
[13:04:50] <MoTiOnXml> Mkop: i don't want to remember the current assigned class
[13:04:58] <Mkop> remove all of them
[13:05:04] <MoTiOnXml> Mkop: unless i remove using prefix
[13:05:09] <MoTiOnXml> Mkop: was thinking of that
[13:05:28] <Mkop> .removeClass(['data-position-top','data-position-bottom','data-position-middle']).addClass('data-position-top')
[13:05:42] <MoTiOnXml> Mkop: yea, looks nice, doesn't it? ;)
[13:05:48] <MoTiOnXml> Mkop: i'm puking, almost :)
[13:05:49] <Mkop> x-ip: what does ajax stand for?
[13:05:56] <MoTiOnXml> async javascript and xml
[13:06:07] <Mkop> didn't ask you :-)
[13:06:11] <MoTiOnXml> ;)
[13:06:27] <MoTiOnXml> i guess somebody should be asking g00gl3
[13:06:32] <x-ip> Mkop, async ....
[13:06:35] <TehRabbitt> ah X_X
[13:06:40] <TehRabbitt> nvm okay it's half working
[13:06:43] <Mkop> I know the answer. the point is to illustrate it to x-ip.
[13:06:58] <x-ip> hmmm trying
[13:06:58] <x-ip> ^^
[13:07:07] <Mkop> x-ip: what does async mean practically?
[13:07:45] <x-ip> throw a function, return right now and a reactor will switch between a lot of functions
[13:07:45] <TehRabbitt> ajpiano: how do I allow the form to still submit :-|
[13:07:55] <TehRabbitt> ajpiano: I figured out what you meant about "Cancling the submit"
[13:07:56] <TehRabbitt> heh
[13:07:59] <snover> ?ajax101 @ Mkop
[13:08:00] <bot-t> Mkop, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41

[13:08:15] <ajpiano> TehRabbitt: getrid of the event.preventDefault
[13:08:21] <TehRabbitt> oh
[13:08:22] <tibbe> Does $.ajax support relative URLs? The docs aren't clear.
[13:08:27] <x-ip> in fact for exampl i have to search how to write a 'while' bucle in googl :S
[13:08:38] <snover> tibbe: 1. yes, 2. ?see tias
[13:08:45] <snover> ?tias @ tibbe
[13:08:46] <bot-t> tibbe, Try It And See
[13:08:48] * x-ip gets embarassed :$
[13:08:54] <Mkop> x-ip: in the case of the browser it specifically means that the request will go on in the background and allow other browser activity (including other ajax requests!) to continue meanwhile
[13:08:57] <snover> sigils, farts
[13:09:00] <TehRabbitt> ajpiano: Ah... so preventDefault could let JS handle it instead of HTML if you wanted to handle it through JS?
[13:09:00] <tibbe> snover: happens to work isn't the same as specified to work
[13:09:19] <Mkop> x-ip: so you can kick off your slow request to /getpkg, and then while that runs you can kick off periodic requests to /getstatus
[13:09:26] <x-ip> Mkop, EXCELLENT WIIIII \o/
[13:09:29] <ajpiano> TehRabbitt yes
[13:09:39] <snover> tibbe: what have you ever used in JS that does not allow relative URLs, curiously?
[13:09:49] <Mkop> I _really_ wish people would stop sending me links to basics, while I'm trying to explain the basics to people.....

[13:10:32] <snover> or was that a leading question

[13:10:39] <Mkop> leading question
[13:10:46] <Hounddog_> hi snover :p
[13:11:04] <Mkop> x-ip: you should not need anyu while loops. use setInterval()
[13:11:18] <Mkop> and then clearInterval() at the end :-)

[13:11:33] <Mkop> great!

[13:20:09] <nicholasschulz> I need some help with jQuery.get function. Anyone who can help me? Im quite new to jQuery,.
[13:21:15] <arek_deepinit> nicholasschulz: what help you need? documentation is pretty complete:)
[13:22:51] <Freddi> hi, I've a question about using named queues in jQuery 1.7: I tried: $('.movable').animate( {'left' : '670px'}, { duration: 500, queue: 'move'} ); But the object is not moving. If I change 'move' into false or if I remove this statement, it works, but I need a named queue and don't understand, why it isn't working.
[13:26:13] <Hounddog_> http://jsfiddle.net/DaAnM/1/ how can i make the color actually slide into the first menu part?
[13:28:54] <Hounddog_> ahhh ok... i think i finally found the animate...
[13:29:09] <Hounddog_> the documentation i mean ;)
[13:33:19] <DofLeFou> what am I doing wrong here https://gist.github.com/1536293
[13:33:51] <Pilate> that is some disturbing shit
[13:34:00] <DofLeFou> lol
[13:34:07] <Pilate> why not actually add an event listener instead of hacking an inline one?
[13:34:34] <DofLeFou> I m pretty new with Jquery â€¦ example?
[13:35:01] <Pilate> return $("<a>").click(ShowAssetDetails);
[13:36:53] <Pilate> or mebbe: return $("<a>").click({'url':url,'asset':asset}, ShowAssetDetails);
[13:38:09] <DofLeFou> let me give that a try â€¦
[13:40:04] <Dreamstar> Hi guys
[13:40:25] <nicholasschulz> is there a "simple" way to validate multiple textfields using jQuery?
[13:40:26] <Hounddog_> http://jsfiddle.net/DaAnM/4/ is it not possible to make the color slide in from the bottom here? if yes... how?
[13:41:37] <Dreamstar> I have smaller problem here; https://pastee.org/ux8cy I want the append(data) to be delayed then faded in
[13:41:42] <Dreamstar> It wont work for me
[13:41:46] <Dreamstar> Any thoughts?
[13:42:12] <DofLeFou> Pilate â€¦. still not right
[13:42:35] <DofLeFou> it is still return <a>some text</a>
[13:42:48] <DofLeFou> I don't see the onclick attr
[13:43:18] <someprimetime> does appendTo() generally just not work in IE?
[13:43:37] <Pilate> Hounddog_: http://jsfiddle.net/DaAnM/5/
[13:43:37] <Woet> which version
[13:43:47] <someprimetime> IE8
[13:43:55] <Woet> should work fine
[13:44:00] <Woet> IE6+ should work fine
[13:44:15] <Woet> but then again, IE itself generally doesn't work
[13:44:32] <someprimetime> haha, yeah.
[13:44:36] <someprimetime> :(
[13:45:12] <Dreamstar> Can anyone give shot at my code?
[13:45:13] <Dreamstar> :p
[13:45:19] <Pilate> DofLeFou: you shouldnt see an onlick attr, thats the point of event handlers
[13:45:28] <Pilate> Dreamstar: can you make a working example with jsfiddle?
[13:45:39] <Woet> ?demo @ Dreamstar
[13:45:39] <bot-t> Dreamstar, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[13:45:48] <Dreamstar> Pilate: Not sure, let me check
[13:47:24] <nicholasschulz> I need some help / thoughts on a registration form Im working on. http://annenetasje.com/area21/register.php is the current for (no validation is added yet). I need help with the LAST step. Complete it and you will understand what I am talking about.
[13:48:40] <Dreamstar> Pilate: I'm sorry, couldnt rly do a live example at jsfiddle
[13:48:48] <Dreamstar> I kinda need some data to use
[13:49:51] <Dreamstar> I just wanna delay the display of the data
[13:49:53] <Dreamstar> ;<
[13:49:57] <nicholasschulz> Whoever wrote "hoi sdf" on my form, would you like to help me?
[13:50:09] <Pilate> lol
[13:50:32] <Woet> Dreamstar: jsfiddle has support for ajax
[13:50:48] <Dreamstar> Woet: Yea, but I guess I need the use of a database
[13:51:13] <Woet> Dreamstar: it's impossible to copy paste the data?
[13:51:38] <Woet> Dreamstar: it's impossible to remove the ajax part and minimize your code to show the actual problem?
[13:51:42] <someprimetime> alright, so i know this jsfiddle is basically useless, but if you look @ the line which has var dropShadow = $('<div class="js-drop-shadow"></div>').hide().appendTo(stickyDiv) http://jsfiddle.net/GA4YD/ that line is not working in IE for some reason
[13:51:44] <djQuery> anyone know of a shared js editor? like piratepad but slammed together with jsbin kinda thing
[13:51:49] <Woet> Dreamstar: you want to delay something, append it and fade it. you don't need ajax.
[13:51:57] <someprimetime> using append() for appendTo() doesn't work
[13:51:59] <Dreamstar> Woet: Oh yea?
[13:52:13] <someprimetime> it's essentially a sticky container that works in every browser except IE right now.
[13:52:36] <Hounddog_> not getting it to slide in the background hmpf
[13:53:10] <Hounddog_> can somebody maybee have a look how i can do this? http://jsfiddle.net/DaAnM/10/
[13:55:10] <nicholasschulz> Hey. I need some help on my registration form. http://annenetasje.com/area21/register.php
[13:55:18] <nicholasschulz> Please take a look and pvt me
[13:55:30] <nicholasschulz> Its the last step i need help with
[13:56:06] <cybersholt> anybody here good with jq ui tabs?
[13:59:06] <sphinxxx> nicholasschulz just explain the problem
[13:59:40] <Hounddog_> so i guess it is not possible to easin the background-color...
[14:00:18] <nicholasschulz> well, the last step you should receive an email with a confirmation link (thats ok, easy). But when the user clicks that link, the mysql database is updated and the account is activated. I need the jQuery to detect that the account is activated and slideUp all the columns.
[14:00:32] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/GA4YD/2/ anyone know why this doesn't work in IE?
[14:00:49] <someprimetime> works in chrome, firefox, opera
[14:00:59] <someprimetime> pretty sure it has to do w/ appendTo()
[14:02:43] <joikus> guys tintin or sherlock holmes tonight
[14:03:35] <Hounddog_> hmmm welll, i could also use a background image maybee....
[14:04:25] <nicholasschulz> sphinxxx did u understand what i need help with?
[14:04:32] <someprimetime> is it possible to delete my jsfiddles?
[14:04:55] <someprimetime> nm yes it is
[14:10:55] <jqueryyunowork>     $("#box"+currentnum).css("left",'0').animate({ left: '-1000',opacity: '0' });
[14:11:11] <jqueryyunowork> ^ this should make box start from 0 and go 1000 pixels to the left, correct?
[14:11:19] <jqueryyunowork> yet, it does not set the initial position of left to 0
[14:11:21] <jqueryyunowork> WHY
[14:12:45] <tfitts> I have a site and in firefox and chrome it works fine and doesn't throw errors.  In internet explorer it also doesn't throw any errors but it doesn't work. I tried loading firebug lite to see if I could figure anything out and simply clicking the firebug lite bookmark makes the page work.  Any idea where to start tracking down the ie bug?
[14:14:07] <tfitts> n/m, works now whatever that was
[14:14:10] <Jon47> tfitts most likely a stray console.log statement
[14:14:24] <tfitts> jon47, that must've been it
[14:14:30] <tfitts> do console.logs kill ie?
[14:14:37] <Jon47> console is not an object in IE
[14:14:41] <Jon47> so it halts execution
[14:14:45] <tfitts> makes sense
[14:14:52] <tfitts> I'll have to make sure I don't have any of those
[14:16:10] <Jon47> tfitts some people put a block like this in a shared library to be extra safe: https://gist.github.com/1536442
[14:16:13] <bartmax> why if i $(data).find('.description') doesn't work with data being plain (external) HTML.
[14:16:38] <Jon47> bartmax that should work
[14:16:42] <bartmax> mmm
[14:16:43] <bartmax> ok
[14:16:45] <Jon47> let's see a fiddle and we can help ya debug
[14:17:09] <tfitts> thanks jon
[14:17:14] <bartmax> Jon47: thanks! found the problem.
[14:18:16] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/KT7A2/2/ any reason why this won't work in IE? pretty sure it has to do with the appendTo() line
[14:18:35] <someprimetime> it's supposed to clone a div and fix it to the top of the window (sticky container)
[14:20:02] <LordThumper> Anyone got a link to jQuery 1.7.1 VSDOC?
[14:20:43] <bartmax> someprimetime: what's if ( !! $('.mod').parent(stickyDiv).length)
[14:20:45] <bartmax> if ( !!
[14:20:49] <bartmax> what's !! ?
[14:23:30] <dabear> bartmax:
[14:23:36] <dabear> ?eval !true
[14:23:40] <bot-t> dabear: false
[14:23:43] <dabear> ?eval !!true
[14:23:46] <bot-t> dabear: true
[14:23:56] <bartmax> 	ok double NOT
[14:23:59] <someprimetime> whoops yeah, sorry
[14:24:03] <dabear> double ! turns a truthy value into a true boolean
[14:24:04] <someprimetime> was responding to a SO thread about this.
[14:24:21] <dabear> for example, the string "test" is true
[14:24:31] <dabear> is truthy*
[14:24:33] <LordThumper> Ok would adding a vsdoc as a resource cause the .js to load on server requests?
[14:24:35] <dabear> but it is not a boolean
[14:24:48] <bartmax> dabear: gotcha
[14:24:51] <dabear> ?eval !!"test" //boolean
[14:24:54] <bot-t> dabear: true
[14:24:55] <LordThumper> I just want the vsdoc for intellisense on visual studio
[14:25:57] <bartmax> dabear: you developed the bot or you know all this commands from memory? :D

[14:52:38] <Hounddog_> darn... now i am seeing that animate is not working at all on my page...
[14:56:22] * Hounddog_ feels like crying now
[14:58:13] <someprimetime> Hounddog_: let's cry together
[14:58:37] <Hounddog_> just need some darn animation for a stupid menu
[14:58:47] <velts> Hounddog_: where is your code?
[14:59:22] <k_89> is $('img').load() fired when all images have finished loading ??
[14:59:38] <Hounddog_> local currently... but i checked in jsfiddle and there it works... just checked with an alert... hover is also beeing called. but animate is doing nothing...
[14:59:49] <Hounddog_> lemme upload.... but it is a mess
[14:59:59] <k_89> i.e., when each img has an img.complete === true??
[15:02:51] <Hounddog_> taking some time for upload... as nothing is changing lol
[15:03:25] <someprimetime> can someone please help me get this working for IE? http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/KT7A2/5/
[15:03:31] <velts> k_89: are you loading each image individually?
[15:04:45] <k_89> velts, did a quick check to see whether i was right or not .. i was right .. I am making an object to handle img preloading and callbacks
[15:05:01] <k_89> not too good at plugin dev pattern
[15:05:05] <k_89> but OK at OOP
[15:05:15] <Hounddog_> velts http://eproplus.danhills.de/ here is the site... you see the box image under publisher there... will give the code also...
[15:05:45] <Hounddog_> http://pastie.org/3092816
[15:06:02] <Hounddog_> at the moment is just the color fade... but not even that is applying...
[15:06:25] <Hounddog_> m somehow disliking wordpress more and more...
[15:07:28] <velts> Hounddog_: ideally if you want help on the IRC, you should attempt to isolate the problem making it easier for more people to help you
[15:07:52] <Hounddog_> velts i tried that with jsfiddle earlier for nearly uhm 2 hours
[15:08:05] <velts> wordpress is only as good as the person using it
[15:08:10] <Hounddog_> velts anyhow, if i isolate the problem there is no problem ;)
[15:08:21] <Hounddog_> the problem is when it is in the wordpress ;)
[15:08:47] <velts> so you have something in your wordpress theme conflicting with your code
[15:09:08] <Hounddog_> exactly and i am currently lost as of why...
[15:09:13] <velts> can you show me the isolated working version?
[15:09:31] <Hounddog_> hover works... checked by adding a alert
[15:09:49] <Hounddog_> http://jsfiddle.net/DaAnM/10/
[15:09:59] <Hounddog_> no problem... just without the image currently
[15:10:14] <velts> ah, so its not a drop down
[15:10:23] <velts> just that changing of the background color
[15:10:27] <velts> correct?
[15:10:40] <Hounddog_> exactly... actually wanted the color to slide in
[15:10:53] <Hounddog_> but want to do that with image and background-position now
[15:11:05] <velts> in your wordpress theme on the main nav correct?
[15:11:05] <Hounddog_> currently not even the color fading works
[15:11:09] <Hounddog_> yep
[15:11:18] <Hounddog_> added a class to the nav menu also
[15:11:37] <velts> now, with wordpress are you using the 'menu' tool?
[15:12:03] <Hounddog_> later i want to create something like this http://www.page-online.de/
[15:12:07] <Hounddog_> velts yes
[15:12:32] <Hounddog_> have registered the menu, put the menu position in the header and in the menu tool added a class to the page
[15:13:26] <Hounddog_> as said, $.('.sf-green').hover(function() { alert('hover')} works...
[15:13:32] <nicholasschulz> I have a general question, let me know what u think. In my registration form, should users validate e-mail through clicking a link provided in an e-mail OR should the user get a one-time-only code sent to their e-mail and then they have to enter that code? What do you think?
[15:13:48] <velts> two secs
[15:13:51] <Hounddog_> which means it is something on the animate itself
[15:14:08] <Hounddog_> also there are 2 jquery files... should also sort that out...
[15:14:30] <Hounddog_> il check on that meanwhile...
[15:16:33] <velts> so the code i am seeing in wordpress is a little different then that in jsfiddle
[15:16:43] <Hounddog_> little
[15:16:54] <velts> you took out the easing..
[15:17:05] <velts> but thats find
[15:17:06] <velts> fine
[15:17:19] <Hounddog_> sfiddle.net/DaAnM/11/
[15:17:24] <Hounddog_> ups didn't update...
[15:17:37] <Hounddog_> http://jsfiddle.net/DaAnM/11/
[15:17:42] <Hounddog_> without easing :)
[15:18:04] <Hounddog_> am just disabling all other scripts
[15:20:16] <velts> hmm, can you get rid of one of the versions of jquer
[15:20:41] <Hounddog_> just doing that... have to change from $ to jQuery and disabling the plugins
[15:20:48] <velts> there are currently three loading
[15:21:03] <velts> http://eproplus.danhills.de/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.7.1
[15:21:09] <velts> http://eproplus.danhills.de/wp-content/plugins/ajax-page-loader-15/jquery.js
[15:21:15] <velts> http://eproplus.danhills.de/wp-content/themes/eproplus/script/jquery.js
[15:21:29] <Hounddog_> plugins... disabling them allready... give me a min...
[15:22:36] <RedFox2> hey
[15:23:45] <cybersholt> anybody know how to format json response inside a jq ui tab?
[15:24:05] <Hounddog_> doing it on the server now... disabled all but one locally but not a change...
[15:25:22] <Hounddog_> all but one is there...
[15:25:31] <velts> k
[15:26:19] <Hounddog_> next step would be for me to just remove everything but the menu can do that also and see where and when it breaks
[15:26:41] <velts> should be ok, give me a sec
[15:26:46] <cybersholt> no body?
[15:26:53] <pur3forlyphe> can you do this in a switch statement?
[15:26:59] <pur3forlyphe> switch (var) {
[15:27:00] <pur3forlyphe> 	    case var < 1001:
[15:27:00] <pur3forlyphe> 		price = 8.00;
[15:27:00] <pur3forlyphe> 	    break;
[15:27:01] <pur3forlyphe> 	
[15:27:01] <pur3forlyphe> 	    case var <= 2000:
[15:27:01] <pur3forlyphe> 		price = 14.00;
[15:27:02] <pur3forlyphe> 	    break;
[15:27:02] <pur3forlyphe> 	
[15:27:02] <pur3forlyphe> 	    case var <= 4000:
[15:27:03] <pur3forlyphe> 		price = 22.00;
[15:27:03] <pur3forlyphe> 	    break;
[15:27:04] <pur3forlyphe> 	    }
[15:27:10] <Hounddog_> use pastie please
[15:27:28] <pur3forlyphe> will do next tie
[15:27:28] <BinaryKitten> ?pastebin @ pur3forlyphe
[15:27:29] <bot-t> pur3forlyphe, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:28:04] <djQuery> pur3forlyphe: how does that relate to jquery?
[15:29:00] <djQuery> pur3forlyphe:  see ?lmgtfy javascript switch statement
[15:29:00] <bot-t> pur3forlyphe, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=
[15:29:07] <BinaryKitten> pur3forlyphe the answer to the question is no, not nicely
[15:29:38] <BinaryKitten> since var will never equal the result of the "var < 1001" statement
[15:30:02] <djQuery> set of iff stateemnts should do it pretty easily unless there are a lot more conditions
[15:30:05] <velts> Hounddog_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/190560/jquery-animate-backgroundcolor
[15:30:37] <velts> seems like its a backgroundColor issue, I do not understand why its working in jsfiddle though
[15:30:44] <pur3forlyphe> ok i will do the if statements for now, eventually im changing this code anyway to feed in data via ajax anyway
[15:31:00] <djQuery> velts: Hounddog_:   jquery.ui adds a lot of stuff that you can do with .animate, I believe that background color is one of them.
[15:31:04] <Hounddog_> hum, then let me try my original task now in moving the background image...
[15:31:05] <pur3forlyphe> ty
[15:31:18] <Hounddog_> velts argh!
[15:31:26] <Hounddog_> i think i forgot to include the ui
[15:31:40] * Hounddog_ sneaks away slowly
[15:31:54] <velts> but do you have UI included on jsfiddle?
[15:32:01] <Hounddog_> lalala
[15:32:04] <BinaryKitten> pur3forlyphe  try ##javascript for more basic help
[15:32:05] <velts> oh yah
[15:32:05] <djQuery> but of course the color plugin is smaller than ui so if you werent using other features of ui .....
[15:32:07] <velts> its there
[15:32:08] <velts> doh
[15:32:11] <Hounddog_> "whistles innocently"
[15:32:14] <velts> lol
[15:32:16] <BinaryKitten> this channel is more for jQuery help
[15:32:34] <Hounddog_> no comment...
[15:33:21] <velts> its weird that you can animate almost anything non color related with just jQuery alone
[15:33:51] <someprimetime> how come this won't work in IE? http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/KT7A2/5/
[15:33:55] <velts> Hounddog_: if you do not care about older browsers you could just do that same animate with just CSS
[15:34:14] <velts> and on older browsers just have it go to a solid color instantly
[15:34:21] <Hounddog_> velts not sure if i have to care about older browser or just put it in css3
[15:34:40] <Hounddog_> but velts the issue here is why i was playing around with background...
[15:34:55] <Hounddog_> http://www.page-online.de/ look at that menu...
[15:35:05] <Hounddog_> that's what i am trying to get at the end...
[15:35:27] <Hounddog_> anyhow, i'l get there... so i will position the background now...
[15:37:11] <BinaryKitten> someprimetime why clone and do all that?
[15:37:12] <velts> Hounddog_: http://pastebin.com/y0JsRQqF
[15:37:34] <BinaryKitten> why not use CSS to make it stick to the top an the rest of the content flow beneath it..
[15:37:41] <someprimetime> BinaryKitten: i want to preserve the original div since it contains a <form>
[15:37:43] <BinaryKitten> then on scroll switch out the classes
[15:37:44] <velts> ahh
[15:37:50] <someprimetime> and it's generally located below the fold
[15:38:07] <BinaryKitten> have a look at ?g jquery waypoints
[15:38:22] <Hounddog_> velts actually not a bad idea...
[15:38:36] <someprimetime> BinaryKitten: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/KT7A2/6/ here is a better example
[15:38:38] <Hounddog_> might be easier then fiddling with javascript...
[15:38:39] <BinaryKitten> http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/sticky-elements/
[15:38:56] <BinaryKitten> someprimetime look at that url, it has what you want done simply
[15:39:25] <someprimetime> BinaryKitten: i'd rather just write it from scratch, tbh
[15:39:36] <someprimetime> trying to move away from plugin dependency
[15:39:50] <BinaryKitten> ok well you can always take a look at the code of it
[15:39:55] <BinaryKitten> and take inspiration from it
[15:39:58] <someprimetime> true
[15:39:59] <someprimetime> thanks
[15:40:28] <BinaryKitten> np, personally if something does a job well, there is little point trying to do it again, unless i'm trying to learn how it did it
[15:40:44] <someprimetime> true
[15:40:52] <BinaryKitten> :)
[15:41:10] <BinaryKitten> I'm a woman of many truths tonight :)
[15:41:20] <someprimetime> you are so truthy
[15:41:58] <someprimetime> eval? !!"BinaryKitten"
[15:42:06] <someprimetime> ?eval !!"BinaryKitten"
[15:42:08] <bot-t> someprimetime: true
[15:42:12] <someprimetime> Yes.
[15:42:14] <Hounddog_> velts but again... as said i need to do some background position actually,,, should also be possible with css3 now or not?
[15:42:16] <someprimetime> damn right, bot-t
[15:43:34] <velts> Hounddog_: you want to modify the background positon on hover?
[15:43:54] <Hounddog_> yeah
[15:44:03] <velts> yah just use css
[15:44:13] <velts> well i would at least
[15:44:22] <velts> i only use animate for moving objects around the page
[15:44:26] <Hounddog_> just checking how i would do that with css to get a nice slidin effect
[15:44:58] <Hounddog_> should learn more on css... beeing too lazy these days...
[15:46:21] <Hounddog_> here it is http://css-tricks.com/examples/SlideInImageBoxes/ :)
[15:46:26] <Hounddog_> more or less
[15:46:50] <velts> nice one, just remember to have a fallback for older browsers
[15:47:27] <Hounddog_> that's my issue... do it with css3 and there might be a problem... with jquery directly no issue even for older browsers...
[15:47:48] <velts> its called progressive enhancement
[15:47:57] <Hounddog_> hehe
[15:48:06] <velts> its not going to look exactly the same, but why hold back the new browsers
[15:48:08] <melii> hello, i load my content dynamicly over ajax and bind the idÂ´s in the loaded content with delegate. the problem is that when i reload the content over ajax, i have to rebind the my idÂ´s and unbind the ids from the old data. can anyone help me?
[15:48:21] <velts> http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/
[15:48:50] <Hounddog_> velts am with you on that, but you know how it is at times... why does it not work cry jabber jabber
[15:49:25] <velts> yah fair enough, gotta know your client i guess, and know what there organization uses
[15:49:28] <Hounddog_> btw... was just checking with ui included and guess what... no change oO
[15:49:46] <velts> if you have access to there browser stats then you could plan around that
[15:49:49] <Hounddog_> just checking if i forgot something else
[15:50:23] <velts> apparently .animate doesn't work for colors without that plugin i sent earlier
[15:50:27] <velts> did you read that thread?
[15:50:52] <Hounddog_> yeah, but not using it for the color
[15:50:58] <Hounddog_> background-position
[15:51:01] <Hounddog_> anyhow...
[15:52:22] <help_plss> hi, i load my content dynamicly over ajax and bind the idÂ´s in the loaded content with delegate. the problem is that when i reload the content over ajax, i have to rebind the my idÂ´s and unbind the ids from the old data. can anyone help me?
[15:52:46] <Hounddog_> ahhh ok, now i understand how the transition works...
[15:52:51] <Hounddog_> with css i mean
[15:53:34] <Hounddog_> -webkit-transition:all 0.2s ease; if i get this right it means that all "changes" will be 0.2s and ease and as hover changes the position voila
[15:56:45] <Hounddog_> velts that's very simple hmmm
[15:56:52] <Hounddog_> and exactly what i need
[15:57:20] <Hounddog_> so to hell with it, if they ask for a older version i shall tell them not possible at the moment ;)
[15:57:32] <CantUnplug> help_plss use live or the livequery plugin
[15:57:49] <help_plss> i used live and i wonÂ´t work
[15:58:07] <help_plss> it wonÃŸt work
[15:58:23] <help_plss> i used on, delegate, live
[15:59:09] <Hounddog_> then all i need is to build the css for a nice menu/submenu hmm
[15:59:59] <help_plss> if i fire a new delegate it after .load() the content it bind the new content, but also the bind to the old content exists
[16:00:15] <readme> What is the preferred way of making a block-level tag collapsable?
[16:00:19] <CantUnplug> use livequery, it worked for me
[16:00:26] <CantUnplug> but you can use scope to rebind if you need
[16:00:30] <help_plss> ok i try thanks
[16:00:47] <CantUnplug> $('.something', ajaxResponse).dosomething
[16:01:41] <jdalton> soo
[16:02:24] <help_plss> yes thatÂ´s what i tried
[16:02:37] <help_plss> you mean the plugin livequery?
[16:02:44] <CantUnplug> yes
[16:03:01] <CantUnplug> it preceeded .live(), but it alsow works better
[16:03:03] <jdalton> why $(â€¦).constructor != $ ?
[16:03:22] <CantUnplug> ..better == more reliable/cross browser
[16:06:29] <help_plss> i semms livequery is down and under construction
[16:06:34] <help_plss> seems
[16:07:22] <CantUnplug> https://github.com/brandonaaron/livequery
[16:07:23] <BinaryKitten> jdalton because you're not doing new $()
[16:07:44] <BinaryKitten> $ is an alias for jQuery which builds your object
[16:08:24] <help_plss> thanks
[16:08:33] <jdalton> BinaryKitten: tell me more
[16:08:57] <BinaryKitten> jdalton there isn't more
[16:09:20] <BinaryKitten> the object is crafted rather than instantiated with a constructor
[16:11:02] <BinaryKitten> jdalton best way to figure it out is to get the uncompressed source and read it
[16:11:10] <biutze> hi, anyone can tell me where to get plugin which resize image before uploading?
[16:11:42] <BinaryKitten> biutze there is nothing that can do that directly using javascript that will work correctly across browsers
[16:11:54] <BinaryKitten> you can use a flash or java applet to accomplish though
[16:12:02] <CantUnplug> biutze there are soem flash things to do that
[16:13:06] <vladikoff> happy holidays BinaryKitten!
[16:13:47] <biutze> CantUnplug: flash? jquery.flash?
[16:13:55] <BinaryKitten> many thanks vladikoff and reciprocated salutations of the seasonal variety back upon oneself
[16:14:07] <CantUnplug> no.. Adobe Flash
[16:14:08] <BinaryKitten> biutze no Adobe Flash
[16:14:17] <CantUnplug> it handles images locally prior to sending the data for upload
[16:14:21] <vladikoff> \o/
[16:17:57] <biutze> CantUnplug: if you have a website, want your subscriber to upload huge image I do need to use Flash for my website is that write?
[16:18:13] <biutze> right?
[16:18:41] <CantUnplug> its the easiest way
[16:18:53] <biutze> BinaryKitten: ?
[16:19:08] <CantUnplug> php cannot send progress/partial notices.. its all or nothign on upload
[16:19:24] <CantUnplug> flash, cgi, applets etc.. can all send bit - allowing you to use progression loaders etc.
[16:20:06] <tomorama> Calling $(".ui-dialog").dialog("close"); to close all open dialogs in a jQuery Mobile page, however only the top dialog gets closed.
[16:20:07] <tomorama> http://jsfiddle.net/zUuSy/1/
[16:20:54] <CantUnplug> $(".ui-dialog").each(function(){ $(this).dialog("close");});
[16:21:10] <CantUnplug> i quick typed that, might not be copy/paste owrthy
[16:21:17] <CantUnplug> looks ok
[16:21:38] <tomorama> Yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing in my code.
[16:21:43] <tomorama> Does the jsfiddle work for you?
[16:23:48] <help_plss> with livequery i have the same problem....pls check the code....mybe there is something wrong by using livequery http://jsfiddle.net/JwJAy/
[16:25:03] * BinaryKitten wonders what livequery is?
[16:25:15] <CantUnplug> help_plss - first, make sure the function is declared first
[16:25:39] <CantUnplug> there is no html/etc to test that on
[16:26:20] <RedFox2> BinaryKitten, maybe .live ?
[16:26:21] <CantUnplug> help_plss i think you have a lot more goign on there
[16:26:22] <RedFox2> :D
[16:26:35] <CantUnplug> BinaryKitten - its like .live
[16:26:42] <CantUnplug> but works a bit 'better'
[16:26:43] <BinaryKitten> oh
[16:26:49] <BinaryKitten> the old thing
[16:26:53] <BinaryKitten> i remember now
[16:27:07] <BinaryKitten> it was what people used before live and delegate
[16:27:10] * RedFox2 wonders what the old thing is?
[16:27:10] <CantUnplug> if you are doing a lot of ajax loads etc.. it seems to handle it better
[16:27:45] <BinaryKitten> RedFox2 livequery was an addon that gave you live/delegate options prior to their addition to jQuery core
[16:28:21] <BinaryKitten> CantUnplug i would say if you can, switch out to using .on (if using 1.7.1)
[16:28:34] <help_plss> what u mean exactly with function is declared first? which function?
[16:28:54] <CantUnplug> i try to.. but simple things like .live("click" on a TR in IE dont work, whereas .livequery does
[16:29:00] <help_plss> i used on too, same problem
[16:29:06] <CantUnplug> minor, but sometimes it worth a few K to load it up and use as needed
[16:29:17] <RedFox2> Binarykitten, yeah when you insert some dynamically html code which you want to add an event listener I guess?
[16:29:45] <CantUnplug> .. at least didnt a couple minor versions ago, i havnt followed up for a new install ina while
[16:29:56] <BinaryKitten> minor versions?
[16:30:16] <BinaryKitten> oh the middle number. right
[16:30:25] <RedFox2> I tried using data-item, data-something, data-anotherthing and then read it using $(this).data("anotherthing") and tried to write it as $(this).data("anotherthing", "NEWVALUE") and it didnt work. Needed to use .attr instead. Is this a common error or my misuse of .data ? thx
[16:30:26] <help_plss> adding an eventlistener is not the problem but when the content will be updated the events are bind to the old data
[16:30:36] <BinaryKitten> jquery main functionality works off that number
[16:31:18] <CantUnplug> help_plss - if you are rmeoving the old or replacing it, they should not esxist in the dom to be rebound too
[16:31:28] <BinaryKitten> RedFox2  .data stores it in the actual element, not the tag. .data can read the html5 data attribute
[16:32:04] <help_plss> i sit now since 2 days on this plblem it try to rebound
[16:32:09] <RedFox2> BinaryKitten... ahh, I thought I can be creative there lol - thx!!
[16:32:41] <BinaryKitten> RedFox2 even though it doesn't appear in the dom, the data is still there
[16:33:03] <BinaryKitten> so .data('x', 'y') will store it an .data('x') will return 'y' later
[16:33:22] <BinaryKitten> it only checks the html5 attribute if the data doesn't exist
[16:33:39] <RedFox2> and will data attrib be then data-x or data="x:y" something?
[16:33:54] <BinaryKitten> nope
[16:34:02] <BinaryKitten> it's not on the dom element
[16:34:07] <BinaryKitten> not on the tag i mean
[16:34:25] <BinaryKitten> it's attached directly to the dom element instance
[16:34:45] <elux> hey guys.. i am trying to do some simple $.getJSON() stuff.. with jsonp .. and im getting "parseerror" .. no matter what I try .. but my json is for sure valid.. the error is saying the anonymous function is not being called.. any ideas why this could be?
[16:35:11] <RedFox2> BinaryKitten, ok need to rtfm on html5 data. thanks!
[16:36:40] <BinaryKitten> RedFox2 nooo..
[16:36:54] <BinaryKitten> ok in jQuery's .data there are 2 parts
[16:37:10] <BinaryKitten> 1 stores the data and retrieves it from the data store
[16:37:49] <BinaryKitten> 2) if no data is found and you are retrieving it, then it looks for an attribute matching the name requrested prefixed with "data-"
[16:38:01] <BinaryKitten> the latter is the html5 data attribute support
[16:38:18] <BinaryKitten> (does a little more than that under the hood but that's it simplified)
[16:38:41] <RedFox2> I wanted to set data-status to true, then to false, then to true and it worked once but not the second time.. this explains it - thx ;)
[16:38:57] <BinaryKitten> RedFox2 forget the attribute
[16:39:12] <BinaryKitten> use that as only a way to pass the base setting from the server
[16:39:17] <BinaryKitten> after that, ignore it
[16:39:42] <BinaryKitten> .data will read from it, and write to the data store (not the attribute as we're forgetting that)
[16:39:46] <RedFox2> I have a list of entries and every entry has different values - so I need this kind of stuff. This was the reason why I used data-blah
[16:39:52] <BinaryKitten> and then read from the data store the next time
[16:40:02] <RedFox2> yes, as I've told that was the mistake
[16:40:03] <BinaryKitten> RedFox2 yes that's fine
[16:40:03] <RedFox2> ;)
[16:40:15] <BinaryKitten> you can still use that
[16:40:22] <RedFox2> I've updated the data storage but not the "attribute"
[16:40:28] <BinaryKitten> :)
[16:40:29] <RedFox2> and I didnt figure it out why so I used .attr
[16:40:48] <RedFox2> (dont punish me for doing that :D)
[16:40:52] <BinaryKitten> attr is ok, but pointless really for realtime stuff
[16:41:01] <RedFox2> I know could have been done better
[16:41:18] <BinaryKitten> it's ok, not punishing you, just trying to help you see the light
[16:41:24] <RedFox2> not pointless
[16:41:29] <RedFox2> I see the light of .data now thx
[16:42:07] <emote> now do me :P
[16:42:07] <RedFox2> I have a list of entries and each entry can be set to true/false. I "abused" the data-status attribute in order to know what ajax request I should do (set it to 1 or 0)
[16:43:54] <RedFox2> (that was too much for her/him I guess)
[16:44:02] * BinaryKitten decides 00:43 = Tea
[16:48:47] <Hounddog_> velts you still there? just a small question... maybe you can just jumpstart me again lol :)

[16:55:00] <someprimetime> can someone help me figure out this retarded appendTo() inconsistency with IE?
[17:00:21] <MeXTuX> I'm trying to make an input to type a url having the string "http://" written automatically and if the user presses backspace key from the last slash to the left the characters must be unerasable. Any idea or example??? tnx in advance :)
[17:02:31] <fotoflo> hi all, I'm playing with the jQueryUI dialog and i've put a <p> in the dialog div, and the <p> is showing through before the dialog is calledâ€¦.  Should i be hiding it onload or setting its visibility manually or?  what is the best practice here?
[17:19:19] <coldhead> fotoflo: hide the container with css
[17:20:25] <someprimetime> can someone help me figure out a solution to get this working in IE? http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/KT7A2/6/
[17:21:00] <fotoflo> coldhead: that's what i ended up doing
[17:21:45] <fotoflo> 	$("#registerDialog").css("visibility", "hidden");	$("#registerLink").click(function(){  $("#loginDialog").dialog({ "options". "options" });  $("#loginDialog").css("visibility", "visible"); //clumsy  }
[17:24:18] <Lann> hello
[17:25:02] <Lann> Why would "$j('a[rel*=facebox]').each(function(index) {" result in the error "attempt to run compile and go on cleared scope" ?
[17:26:07] <pifantastic> Lann: where is this runing?
[17:26:18] <Lann> inline
[17:26:20] <Lann> no wait
[17:26:21] <Lann> doc.ready
[17:28:17] <Lann> not really sure what it's talking about
[17:28:58] <coldhead> http://xkcd.com/979/
[17:30:22] <pifantastic> Lann: what browser?
[17:30:48] <pifantastic> Lann: and can you reproduce in a fiddle?
[17:32:34] <Lann> i definately can't reproduce with merely a fiddle
[17:33:37] <coldhead> definitely*
[17:34:55] <Lann> heh...close brace
[17:35:05] * Lann shakes a fist at the sky!
[17:36:11] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/KT7A2/7/ WHY won't you work in IE :'(
[17:58:29] <nicholasschulz> Hey. I would really appreciate if you all took a quick look at my registration form. The only thing i miss is validation of each field (ill get to that tomorrow). http://annenetasje.com/area21/register.php The only thing you will need to fill in is your e-mail to receive the code needed. Nothing of your information is stored.
[17:58:50] <nicholasschulz> Pros and cons would be appreciated
[18:01:19] <Hounddog_> velts http://localhost/wordpress/ the final menu, some colors and different background images and done :)
[18:02:00] <Hounddog_> velts http://eproplus.danhills.de/ this of course
[18:06:34] <nicholasschulz> Any thoughts on the form anyone?
[18:08:37] <Axsuul> are we not allowed to use multiple selectors for .on()? $(document).on('click', '.foo, .bar', ... ?
[18:20:00] <nicholasschulz> does someone live around Petaling Jaya here?
[18:30:25] <vladikoff> bot-t, tell nicholasschulz http://meetups.jquery.com/group/jquerymalaysia
[18:30:26] <bot-t> vladikoff, Okay.
[18:31:29] <MeXTuX> does anybody have a twitter validation example??? ie @JohnDoe @johnsmith etc
[18:32:44] <vladikoff> MeXTuX, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6024848/regex-to-validate-a-twitter-url
[18:32:55] <MeXTuX> tnx u
[19:06:30] <iamjarvo1> does anyone know what effect the stack exchange sites use?  for example this one http://apple.stackexchange.com/ . seems like the slide down then fade in
[19:13:29] <pifantastic> iamjarvo1: $("body:not(.no-message-slide)").animate({
[19:13:29] <pifantastic>                 marginTop: r + "px"
[19:13:30] <pifantastic>             }, "fast", "linear")
[19:15:03] <rmurphey> oh man pifantastic i was JUST GETTING THERE
[19:15:16] <rmurphey> hate you
[19:15:26] <pifantastic> rmurphey: that took some real sleuthing
[19:15:40] <pifantastic> inspector + http://jsbeautifier.org/
[19:15:50] <rmurphey> or the crhome dev tools {} thingy
[19:16:09] <pifantastic> WAT
[19:16:12] <iamjarvo1> thanks
[19:16:14] <pifantastic> I didnt know it did that!
[19:16:33] <pifantastic> #TIL
[19:16:49] <iamjarvo1> so with chrome dev tools you can uncompress js?
[19:16:57] <rmurphey> https://skitch.com/rdmey/gwh7c/apple-stack-exchange
[19:17:35] <pifantastic> iamjarvo1: well, it formats it
[19:17:43] <pifantastic> it won't un-obfuscate it
[19:18:04] * rmurphey gets to work on a tool that turns _a4 into doSomethingAmazing
[19:20:32] <iamjarvo1> this might be a dumb question but how did you guys know to look in full-anon
[19:21:04] <rmurphey> iamjarvo1: i looked at the element that was being used
[19:21:18] <rmurphey> and it had an id of 'notify-something'
[19:21:25] <rmurphey> and so then i searched all the scripts for notify-something
[19:21:27] <rmurphey> er, notify
[19:21:30] <iamjarvo1> ahh i see
[19:21:50] <rmurphey> actually i guess at that point i'd already guessed on full-anon
[19:22:03] <rmurphey> it was one of only two scripts being served from /js
[19:22:19] <rmurphey> on a cdn
[19:22:23] <rmurphey> all the rest were third-party i think
[19:22:33] <iamjarvo1> learned another trick about dev tolls you can search all scripts
[19:22:42] <nuba> rmurphey: hey aren't you supposed to be on vacation? outta here! ;)
[19:23:00] <rmurphey> actually i'm not sure you can search all scripts :)
[19:23:58] <iamjarvo1> eh you cant
[19:24:01] <iamjarvo1> i got excited
[19:24:03] <rmurphey> sorry
[19:24:11] <rmurphey> i guess i made an educated guess about the file
[19:24:21] <rmurphey> based on where it was being served from
[19:24:30] <iamjarvo1> the input should have search script instead of search scripts lol
[19:24:57] <rmurphey> indeed :)
[19:26:11] <abjorn> PROPER TESTING, HOW DOES IT WORK?
[19:26:29] <abjorn> coldhead: our developers are at their same shit again :(
[19:26:55] <iamjarvo1> rmurphey:  are you rebecca murphey ?
[19:27:06] <abjorn> no thats just a total coincidence
[19:27:14] <rmurphey> she is me
[19:28:42] <iamjarvo1> when are you guys doing another yayquery
[19:41:51] <rmurphey> hard to say iamjarvo1
[19:41:53] <rmurphey> but someday :)
[19:42:47] <iamjarvo1> haha sounds god
[19:42:49] <iamjarvo1> good*
[19:51:13] <intellilogic> $(this).closest("form").find("input:not([type='button']), select")  <- something wrong with this selector?
[19:51:41] <Aliv3> ah been a long time since ive been here
[19:52:55] <coldhead> i remember you
[19:54:30] <Aliv3> how so
[19:55:20] <coldhead> i don't know, something to do with synapses
[20:13:44] <intellilogic> This is producing unchecked either way...  if($('#num').is(':checked')){console.log("checked");}else{console.log("unchecked");}
[20:16:22] <Chib> intellilogic: there's nothing wrong with that selector, you are probably misunderstanding what it does though
[20:19:59] <intellilogic> my checkbox is aparently always checked ...  http://haydenliquidations.com/RapidWebInventory/BCG/Labels/Label_Tool.php
[20:20:25] <intellilogic> OMFG
[20:20:28] <intellilogic> I fail
[21:28:22] <jamescarr> so is there some special way to trigger a mailto: without changing window.location
[21:30:08] <iateadonut> i have a function that prints out a graph based on JSON data (i think).  when the string of data is printed out in the source code and assigned to... var data = [{"data":[["1","1689"],...  ; running that through the function, createGraph(data) works.  However, when I retrieve the string from an ajax call, assign it to data and run the function:... $.ajax... success: function( dataGet ){	makeGraph(dataGet);...  it does not work.
[21:30:08] <iateadonut> I think this is because ajax is not converting the string into a series of objects.
[21:30:11] <pifantastic> jamescarr: from what I understand, you cannot trigger default behavior, only bound events
[21:30:17] <pifantastic> so, no, I dont think so
[21:30:33] <jamescarr> yeah, all I could do is a window.open on the href
[21:30:45] <iateadonut> so the question is, how do i convert that string into a multi-dimensional array?
[21:30:49] <pifantastic> iamjarvo1: dataType: "json"
[21:30:52] <pifantastic> oops
[21:31:02] <pifantastic> iateadonut: dataType: "json"
[21:31:23] <pifantastic> or just use getJSON
[21:31:29] <pifantastic> ?getJSON @ iateadonut
[21:31:30] <bot-t> iateadonut, jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[21:32:12] <iateadonut> dataType:"json" did it.
[21:32:13] <iateadonut> thanks.
[21:32:40] <iateadonut> what a wonderful library jquery is.
[21:33:03] <iateadonut> pifantastic, thank you very much.
[21:33:34] <pifantastic> iateadonut: no problem
[21:41:24] <neteffect> hi
[21:41:37] <pifantastic> neteffect: hi
[21:46:00] <flebel> close
[21:46:27] <flebel> close
[21:53:10] <pifantastic> open
[22:40:11] <LordThumper> $(function() { }). Is that equal to $(document).ready(function() {})?
[22:41:03] <_ikke_> yes
[22:43:46] <LordThumper> Thanks
[23:48:13] <ruby_on_tails> does anyone know of a plugin which could help me build molecular structure/network like stuff ?
[23:50:57] <donCams> hey guys
[23:52:04] <donCams> say i have two forms, i want to pass some data entered in the first form to the second form via ajax, then submit the second form in the background with the data from the first form. is that possible? php's my server-side
[23:52:27] <_ikke_> donCams: Why via ajax?
[23:53:17] <donCams> nevermind... i really can't answer that question, i just want to :)
[23:54:23] <shesek> You want to send an AJAX request to update a form that's already a part of the DOM, which you can update using regular DOM manipulation functions?
[23:54:28] <shesek> Why would you want to do that?
[23:55:02] <donCams> no, the second form is in another file
[23:55:11] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[23:55:31] <Double_Rainbow> https://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php?ref_id=147676246567 < is there a jquery plugin for that?
[23:55:36] <_ikke_> donCams: You mean, another page?
[23:55:42] <donCams> anyway, i'm doing it via php sessions now
[23:55:57] <donCams> yeah. coz it's for a service and they're not accepting cURL requests
[23:56:03] <_ikke_> Double_Rainbow: For what exactly?
[23:56:16] <donCams> you have to use their form to get the response i want
[23:56:38] <Double_Rainbow> _ikke_: that style of click a box
[23:56:42] <Double_Rainbow> and it slides down
[23:56:53] <_ikke_> donCams: It's technically impossible to distinguish between curl and a browser
[23:57:09] <donCams> lmao. not in their case. i don't know how they do it... but they do it
[23:57:19] <_ikke_> donCams: They probably require you to send a token they send with the form
[23:57:21] <donCams> it's been bugging me... anyway, if you want to know, it's aweber
[23:57:40] <donCams> _ikke_, like a non-existent img?
[23:57:52] <_ikke_> standard CSRF
[23:57:55] <_ikke_> No
[23:58:05] <_ikke_> A hidden form element
[23:58:35] <donCams> i'm sending all the hidden form elements via curl and it's still blocking the request
[23:58:46] <_ikke_> What form?
[23:59:00] <donCams> aweber form
[23:59:11] <_ikke_> donCams: On what page?
[23:59:50] <donCams> it's really hard to explain
