[00:09:41] <VeXii> lee_: a timer can work fine.
[00:10:00] <lee_> but how to call based on the class name
[00:11:05] <wowtux> VeXii, yeah https://www.google.com/jsapi
[00:11:18] <wowtux> VeXii, is loading before than ga_custom.js my script

[00:13:22] <VeXii> nope
[00:14:13] <wowtux> VeXii, you refer i need put google.load('gdata', '2.x', {packages: ['analytics']}); inside document.ready function ?

[00:19:06] <wowtux> VeXii, what error?
[00:19:22] <BlaDe^> is there any reason why a control would require .fadeIn() to be called twice to show?
[00:19:37] <wowtux> VeXii, it only fail to me when i dont use feedUri inside loadData() function
[00:19:38] <BlaDe^> literally I either have to double click, or to $(...).fadeIn('fast').fadeIn('fast');  for it to show
[00:19:52] <BlaDe^> i don't think it was always like this, i think it has happened in a jQuery update
[00:20:04] <wowtux> VeXii, if i comment this line it fail, if i uncomment feedUri= ... line inside loadData its works

[00:27:05] <erlnoob> ok guys, I'm modifying a plugin, adding a callback settings in the startup method. I then call this function somewhere. Everything works ok, I just need $(this) inside the callback function to bind to the $(this) object when I call it. How do I do this?
[00:27:30] <erlnoob> s/when/at the time
[00:27:53] <VeXii> wowtux: sorry man i cant see it
[00:28:03] <VeXii> might need some sleep ^^

[00:29:21] <VeXii> :p

[00:55:49] <Chibby_> can anyone please tell me if there's a simple way to tell if someone has typed shift+enter in a textarea? i was thinking of just setting/unsetting a variable whenever a keydown/keyup event for shift is done and then checking that variable when i get a keyup event for the enter key

[01:45:43] <JillesCode> xec yeah wtf..
[01:46:35] <xec> is the function defined before the html? not inside some ready event or anything?
[01:47:09] <JillesCode> xec, yeah it is I think

[01:49:21] <xec> ?ask @ Pumi
[01:49:22] <bot-t1> Pumi, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:49:42] <Pumi> wow nice bot ;)

[01:50:16] <Pumi> lines  14-18 do not work on ipad and mobile phones
[01:50:40] <Pumi> btw this is a function from my "lighbox" i am coding
[01:51:09] <Pumi> and i need all anchors tags, that have "mybox" on rel attribute
[01:51:23] <Pumi> to be disabled

[01:54:17] <lee_> \somebody reply
[01:55:35] <xec> lee_: what have you tried so far
[01:55:49] <lee_> i tried puting divs
[01:56:10] <lee_> i got a corousel script
[01:56:52] <Chibby_> i don't know what you mean by rotate
[01:56:55] <lee_> but something is missing
[01:57:03] <xec> i'm guessing he wants a slider
[01:57:05] <xec> ?demo @ lee_
[01:57:06] <bot-t1> lee_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[01:57:12] <lee_> ya
[01:57:41] <lee_> uu see this
[01:58:38] <Kingsy> does anyone know of any blogs that discuss 3d images, image pan/zoom etc? I want to implement something along those lines in jquery but I don't really know where to start as far as file formats (I am assuming just using images will be ok)
[01:58:50] <xec> lee_: if you have control over the html, you could use this: http://www.gmarwaha.com/jquery/jcarousellite/#demo
[01:59:10] <xec> lee_: it allows you to set a number for how many images you want to scroll at a time
[01:59:36] <xec> lee_: see "scroll more"
[02:01:20] <boost> hi guys
[02:01:24] <boost> i lost the connection
[02:01:39] <boost> i am lee
[02:02:13] <xec> i'l PM you what i wrote
[02:02:27] <boost> http://khadination.impezerp.com/ see this link under featured products u can see 6 boxes
[02:02:36] <boost> i want 3 to be displayed at atime
[02:02:46] <boost> and 3 should slide
[02:06:22] <xec> boost: if you don't control the html, I'm guessing you would need to write a slider tailored to your html structure
[02:07:15] <sweetgrass> Hi all. I am trying to add effects to a basic script but i can't seem to get them to take. I've googled but still not getting anywhere. Can someone take a look at this code and give me some pointers, please!! http://pastie.org/2860863
[02:07:46] <Pumi> Does someone here have access to internet on ipad or any smartphone, to test something for me ?
[02:09:57] <boost> can somebody point me  to any links where you can display 3 divs in a slider
[02:10:13] <xec> i just did
[02:10:21] <xec> twice
[02:10:23] <boost> i have control to the master div which holds the div
[02:11:02] <Kingsy> has anyone in here had experience with 3d images on the web?
[02:11:21] <boost> ok
[02:12:19] <paq> Pumi: install Android SDK if you need testing on mobile browsers
[02:12:45] <boost> Xec but this is ul li tags
[02:13:13] <paq> you'll have the built-in browser and you can install opera mobile, opera mini, firefox etc
[02:13:17] <xec> boost: that's why i asked if you control the html
[02:13:36] <xec> boost: if you don't, you would need to tailor something for yourself
[02:13:47] <xec> to suit the html structure
[02:13:55] <boost> xec the data is coming from database
[02:14:30] <sweetgrass> can anyone help me, please. See question above
[02:15:05] <boost> if you open the website http://khadination.impezerp.com/ in chrome you could see the html
[02:16:05] <boost> under featured products
[02:16:31] <xec> sweetgrass: i don't see any effects/animation in that script?
[02:17:03] <boost> i dont have much idea in jquery friends
[02:17:38] <sweetgrass> xec: there aren't any because I've failed to get any to work. i tried to wrap the removeClass in a .hide but that didn't work
[02:18:31] <xec> sweetgrass: it's sort of hard to tell what the script is doing, could you make a working demo? see ?demo
[02:18:31] <bot-t1> sweetgrass, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[02:18:33] <sweetgrass> xec: I don't know what I am doing qrong
[02:18:48] <sweetgrass> xec: yeah, i'll make a demo
[02:20:16] <boost> ):
[02:30:48] <Kingsy> man there is literally no information out there on 3d image software for the web.
[02:31:37] <xec> Kingsy: http://xkcd.com/305/
[02:32:49] <sweetgrass> xec: hi, sorry about the lack of demo. I have knocked one up here: http://jsfiddle.net/yT2nk/4/
[02:35:23] <Kingsy> xec: very good.. doesnt really help in my search tho :P
[02:35:56] <xec> figured it was a good time for a break :D
[02:36:12] <xec> sweetgrass: so, what is it supposed to do
[02:36:19] <Kingsy> hehe
[02:37:06] <Kingsy> its actually quite crazy how little there is in the way of software. I have found 1 application.. and its 800 euros
[02:37:17] <Kingsy> (online application I mean)
[02:37:29] <sweetgrass> xec: there's a select above the table with 4 options. When the user selects a different column set from the select, the cells need to change to the new data, but all i can get to work is removing and adding of classes.
[02:40:28] <sweetgrass> xec: can you see what i mean?
[02:49:49] <xec> sweetgrass: i'm off to lunch, but it appears targetCols is undefined?
[02:50:30] <sweetgrass> xec: really?
[02:52:07] <sweetgrass> xec: ah yes, one of the class names in the html had a typo
[02:54:29] <sweetgrass> xec: here's an updated version. http://jsfiddle.net/yT2nk/5/
[03:13:02] <sweetgrass> Hi, in xec's absence, could some one give me a hand with this code: http://jsfiddle.net/yT2nk/12/ and perhaps help me find the correct way of doing what I am trying to do.

[03:23:45] <drupol> hello,
[03:24:05] <drupol> I'm looking for help for a selector... at first it looks simple, but it's been 1h that I'm on it...
[03:24:09] <drupol> This page: http://dev.through-my-eyes.be/portfolio
[03:24:16] <drupol> I'm trying to get all the LI in a class
[03:24:34] <drupol> test = $('.views-field-field.photos .field-content .item-list ul li'); console.log(test);
[03:24:42] <drupol> This always returns an empty array().
[03:26:44] <nir0> try $('.item-list ul li'); console.log(test);
[03:27:40] <drupol> nir0: I don't want them all, I just want those enclosed in .views-field-field-photos
[03:28:09] <drupol> but this works.
[03:28:18] <drupol> if I add .field-content in front too
[03:29:13] <nir0> drupol: i dont see where is parent div with class views-field-field.photos
[03:29:29] <drupol> Damn monday morning...
[03:29:31] <drupol> sorry
[03:29:40] <drupol> it's a dash instead of a .
[03:30:51] <nir0> anyways ur styles are crap, for example, u dont need to mark first and last li with class, u can use .item-list ul li:first-child etc
[03:31:13] <drupol> yup, I know, it's automatically generated by the framework.
[03:31:28] <nir0> oh i see
[03:32:30] <nir0> $('.informer').css('display') #=> "block"
[03:32:30] <nir0> $('.informer')[0].css('display') #=> TypeError: $(".informer")[0].css is not a function
[03:32:52] <nir0> and i need to find styles on some particular element
[03:33:07] <xec> ?eq @ nir0
[03:33:08] <bot-t1> nir0, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[03:33:42] <nir0> thanks, i'll try that
[03:35:52] <sweetgrass> xec: hi. I have updated  my demo so it works and to explain what is meant to haopen.
[03:36:07] <sweetgrass> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/yT2nk/12/
[03:39:26] <xec> sweetgrass: yea i had a look, but it looks... messy
[03:39:54] <xec> sweetgrass: maybe comment your code, what is each part supposed to do
[03:40:02] <xec> and why
[03:40:57] <sweetgrass> xec: sorry, i thought it was simple enough to read. I'll comment.
[03:41:32] <Kingsy> anyone in here used http://jquery.vostrel.cz/reel before?
[03:45:58] <xec> sweetgrass: i commented out some of the weird looking code: http://jsfiddle.net/yT2nk/13/
[03:51:17] <sweetgrass> xec: ok, so, you've commented out the fuzzy logic i'd added and the script works. So I guess i don't need the logic. how do i go about adding effects to this?
[03:53:13] <xec> trying to figure that out, maybe make it not depend on the css first
[03:55:09] <sweetgrass> xec: i thought it would be a simple case of wrapping the remove/addClass in an effect but that doesn't work at all
[03:56:09] <xec> yeah, the effects often use css, so the custom css is likely a problem
[03:56:26] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/yT2nk/17/
[03:57:18] <sweetgrass> xec: so don't rely on statColVisible to display the targetCols?
[03:57:42] <xec> right, notice i hide() the others
[03:58:04] <xec> still using that class to find what we're looking for though
[03:58:40] <sweetgrass> xec: ah yes, i see. small change but makes all the difference.
[03:59:44] <xec> not sure if this is the best approach, but you get the idea
[04:00:46] <solidus-lake> I think i'm durastically mis understanding filters..
[04:00:57] <solidus-lake> $("ul.posts ul.tags li")
[04:01:10] <solidus-lake> does that search for ul.posts, then WITHIN ul.posts search for a ul.tags?
[04:01:18] <solidus-lake> because for me its getting ul.posts and ul.tags and li
[04:04:23] <xec> solidus-lake: $("ul.posts ul.tags li") will select all <li> elements under .tags under .posts
[04:04:26] <htd> hi, i am using jquery tabs with ajax loading their content. the onload event does not get triggered after loading an url that was inside the content, any hints how to fix that?
[04:04:34] <sweetgrass> solidus-lake: that looks to me as though it will target any li whose parent is ul.tags that has a parent of ul.posts
[04:05:56] <sweetgrass> xec: well, it might not be the best approach but it works and is more refined than my clunky attempt
[04:06:06] <sweetgrass> xec: many thanks for your help
[04:06:11] <xec> yw :)
[04:06:53] <xec> htd: i'm not quite sure what you mean, do you have a link to your page, or a demo? see ?demo
[04:06:53] <bot-t1> htd, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[04:07:20] <solidus-lake> xec: for some reason this $("ul.posts ul.tags li").each() is getting all ul.tags and all ul.tags.li
[04:07:32] <sweetgrass> xec: one thing, the syntax you've used, applies the adding and fading in inside the main bit. How does that work??
[04:07:55] <xec> solidus-lake: it shouldnt, could you make a demo too?
[04:07:57] <solidus-lake> xec: oh wait, i think i get it!, does that search search for tags* or "tags"
[04:08:41] <xec> ?fadeOut @ sweetgrass
[04:08:41] <bot-t1> sweetgrass, .fadeOut([duration], [callback]): Hide the matched elements by fading them to transparent. http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/
[04:08:55] <xec> sweetgrass: the second parameter of fadeOut is a callback
[04:09:11] <xec> sweetgrass: which is a function that gets executed when the effect is finished
[04:09:31] <sweetgrass> xec: right ok. makes sense
[04:09:54] <xec> sweetgrass: and seeing as we don't want to show more than one at a time, we wait till it's done hiding before we show the new one
[04:10:06] <sweetgrass> :)
[04:10:25] <sweetgrass> xec: ok. simple really. don't know why i struggled so much

[04:47:32] <tman> dirty*
[04:47:54] <walid> i tried for 3-4 hours to debug it, but i  can't find out the problem

[04:51:37] <walid> someone here? :)
[04:53:17] <xec> walid: you're using a very old version of jQuery
[04:53:21] <xec> 1.2.6
[04:53:33] <walid> xec: duh
[04:53:36] <walid> of course...
[04:53:47] <xec> .live was introduced in 1.3
[04:54:07] <TotoTitus> hi, i have a problem with a class selector, can anyone spare a minute ?
[04:54:09] <walid> i'l upgrade it(even though it's a big mess with drupal. tried using the noConflict method, but no luck with it so far :(
[04:54:49] <TotoTitus> <input class="some" type="text" value="" name="country">
[04:54:56] <TotoTitus> $('.some') returns null
[04:55:18] <TotoTitus> am i missing something /
[04:55:19] <xec> TotoTitus: 10 bucks say you're trying to select it before it exists in the DOM
[04:55:29] <TotoTitus> no, i am executing this in firebug
[04:55:33] <TotoTitus> in the console
[04:55:41] <TotoTitus> long after everything has been loaded
[04:55:44] <xec> damn
[04:55:46] <xec> hehe
[04:55:50] <xec> okay, what is $ ?
[04:56:00] <TotoTitus> the global jquery object ?
[04:56:03] <xec> and what does jQuery('.some') return
[04:56:06] <TotoTitus> null
[04:56:16] <xec> did you try it
[04:56:22] <TotoTitus> yes, several times
[04:56:29] <xec> do you have an url?
[04:56:32] <xec> or a demo?
[04:56:39] <TotoTitus> 1 sec
[04:56:55] <BlankVerse> i have included the jquery cdn google url and then i include a jquery call inline using <script> tags , which doesnt executre
[04:57:12] <BlankVerse> what is the correct way to execute jquery functions inline?
[04:57:39] <BlankVerse> do i need to write it in an external js file?
[04:57:53] <SoulRaven> if i have multiple selectboxes is it posibile to detect when a select boxes has made a selction using $.change()
[04:58:00] <xec> TotoTitus: http://jsfiddle.net/NWaPH/1/
[04:58:33] <subdesign> hi
[04:59:24] <subdesign> q: if i have an LI with a spec. class, i want to find the next UL tag. how? thx
[05:02:31] <Kingsy> ok what could this be.. I have some jquery running on a page.. and it seems to work on first load.. but if you refresh the page several times.. the jquery just stops working, and by stops working I mean exactly that.. it just fails to change the elements on the page.. just doesnt execute the function
[05:02:36] <Kingsy> no errors no nothing
[05:03:25] <xec> subdesign: your question doesnt make much sense, maybe show us a html snippet, mark what you have and what you want
[05:04:39] <Kingsy> hmm looks like Ctrl+F5 breaks it.. pressing enter on the url bar fixes it.. hows that?
[05:05:14] <subdesign> xec: http://pastie.org/2861469  it a navigation menu, if the li tag gets "selected" from php, i want to slideDown the next UL tag
[05:05:45] <subdesign> i try to use :first but i get all the ul s
[05:06:42] <xec> next = descendant?
[05:06:44] <walid> xec: hm i tried including the new jquery, but still no luck.. :(
[05:07:02] <walid> problem is i need to have 2 versions running side by side..
[05:07:11] <walid> i tried this: http://drupal.org/node/578712
[05:07:23] <subdesign> with next i get empty result (firebug)
[05:07:30] <subdesign> next('ul')
[05:07:45] <subdesign> html:
[05:08:10] <xec> walid: and you made the plugin use the new version?
[05:08:29] <subdesign> so the html: http://pastie.org/2861492
[05:09:01] <ottorinde> Hi! I'm using the Jquery tooltip library (jquery.tools.min.js), and have made some elements with a "title" attributes. When I update the "title" of these elements, the tooltip does not. Seems that the library removes the title and updates the tooltip the first time, but not after I run the code again. Anybody experienced someting similar?
[05:09:29] <walid> meaning changed function($) to $function($jq) ?
[05:09:44] <walid> (in case var $jq = jquery.noConflict(true)
[05:10:25] <xec> walid: is there anything outside the function, like some parens?
[05:10:41] <walid> outside which function?
[05:10:56] <xec> the one you just referred to
[05:10:59] <walid> (sorry, i played a bit with jquery, but can't say i'm an expert ;) )
[05:11:06] <walid> nope
[05:11:19] <xec> what was you url again
[05:11:21] <xec> your*
[05:11:31] <walid> http://sebi.vbbros.net/?q=musik
[05:12:20] <xec> and the plugin you're trying to make work is sc-player.js ?
[05:12:42] <walid> yes
[05:12:46] <xec> change the first line back to: (function($) {
[05:12:49] <walid> doc: http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/custom-player
[05:12:57] <walid> done
[05:13:05] <xec> and the last line to: })($jq);
[05:13:33] <walid> aha
[05:13:34] <walid> .
[05:13:53] <maraujop> Hi, I'm using effect to shake a div. Div shakes but the problem is that div above, moves vertically like 10 pixels while the animation is in progress, then returns to its place, any hints why this happens?
[05:14:12] <walid> xec: ur awesome.
[05:14:25] <xec> ;D
[05:14:27] <walid> i just broke another plugin, but i'll try and solve this one on my own.
[05:14:31] <walid> :)
[05:14:32] <walid> (y)
[05:16:19] <nyk> anyone there who could test a script from a site of mine in IE and tell me why it doesnt work there? (works fine in firefox and chrome)
[05:17:12] <xec> subdesign: what is *this* in your javascript?
[05:18:10] <subdesign> i guess #nav li
[05:18:22] <xec> what is your if inside
[05:18:40] <subdesign> so i dont select anything you mean?
[05:19:33] <xec> are you looping through something somehow? or is this your entire script?
[05:19:54] <subdesign> no its a part of the script
[05:20:01] <xec> what is the context
[05:20:14] <subdesign> huh
[05:20:22] <xec> what part of the script is this
[05:20:41] <subdesign> i runs every load
[05:21:19] <maraujop> Hi, I'm using effect to shake a div. Div shakes but the problem is that div above, moves vertically like 10 pixels while the animation is in progress, then returns to its place, any hints why this happens?
[05:21:21] <subdesign> i changed my menu routine and now i have to change the js too
[05:21:30] <subdesign> full code:
[05:22:13] <subdesign> http://pastie.org/2861540 now its a mess
[05:23:16] <xec> subdesign: does this make sense to you: http://jsfiddle.net/fSfqc/
[05:27:24] <xec> subdesign: you have a click event handler, inside of which, 'this' will be the <a> element, but you appear to assume it's going to be a <li>
[05:27:40] <subdesign> hm
[05:27:53] <xec> subdesign: the <ul> is not going to be a descendant of <a>
[05:28:00] <xec> (i hope)
[05:28:08] <subdesign> i see
[05:29:29] <xec> you use .parent() on line 17 but not the rest
[05:30:01] <subdesign> i deleted already
[05:30:21] <xec> anyway, yes... I agree, it's a mess ;)
[05:30:35] <xec> probably quicker to rethink the logic and rewrite
[05:30:53] <subdesign> okay story: this code works with cookies, but i changed the menu system to a lib and i want to change
[05:30:59] <subdesign> yes ur right
[05:31:44] <subdesign> i ll rewrite
[05:38:40] <ecksit> Hi, I was wondering if someone could give me a hand with http://pastesite.com/28172/5bvgfbsdgr ? The files exist and jQuery is loading fine but I cannot pin point the issue.
[05:38:46] <subdesign> hey xec with your code and mine works well :P
[05:38:57] <subdesign> thx
[05:39:03] <xec> :)
[05:39:44] <ecksit> (it is meant to make an ajax call to that file and then alert out that the data was loaded as well as setting the div to contain the returned html)
[05:40:10] <subdesign> i stored in cookies the menu open state, but cookie is not always enabled, and my new lib can handle acitve menu state
[05:40:59] <Kingsy> anyone in here worked closely with reel.js? the image rotating lib ?
[05:41:03] <xec> ecksit: what happens instead? form submits like normal? :)
[05:41:30] <ecksit> Yes. Should I add something in to prevent it doing it normally?
[05:42:27] <xec> ecksit: yes, try return false;
[05:43:38] <ecksit> Ah, thanks. Silly me.
[05:51:40] <nyk> could anyone try why the jquery autocomplete there isnt working in IE and opera (works fine in firefox) http://nyktalgia.dyndns.org/feepsSymfony/web/app.php/   (it's the search field: test with the words red or cola)
[06:26:56] <Aamir> nyk:  http://gyazo.com/53aa1c726c775ab96746a8e12e0e0e07
[06:29:41] <nyk> ok, thank you! do you know what to do to correct this maybe, too?
[06:30:08] <phryk> Hi there. I have a problem with the following script: http://pastie.org/2861847
[06:30:30] <Aamir> nyk: try to find that line and use firebug lite or alert to check the var JSON in ie
[06:30:39] <phryk> As you can see in bfInit, I set up an interval to switch through the #beltfeeder-<n> divs.
[06:30:57] <phryk> The thing that annoys me is that bfNext() gets called twice, and I have no clue whatsoever why that happens.
[06:31:28] <phryk> You can see that behaviour here: http://celloro.b-onweb.de/
[06:33:16] <Aamir> phryk:  use breakpoints in bfNext method (in firebug) to find out where the call is from
[06:33:29] <Aamir> call* = 2nd call
[06:34:54] <phryk> Aamir: how do I do that (I'm fairly stupid regarding js)?
[06:34:57] <b0ot_> Does anyone have any good links to tutorials on how to create conditional forms? For example i want a user to be able to add more than one groups of something to fill out, and each group can have a different category which will determine the type of questions asked.
[06:36:12] <Aamir> phryk:  follow http://getfirebug.com/doc/breakpoints/demo.html#eval
[06:36:16] <Puj> phryk, how do you know it is executing twice?
[06:36:33] <phryk> Puj: I added an alert() ^^;
[06:36:58] <Aamir> phryk:  not sure but i think ur restart method might be calling start again? :/
[06:37:29] <phryk> But kills the interval before with bfStop, I already tried leaving that out.
[06:38:27] <Aamir> phryk:  how r u killing setInterval? you need timer = setIntervalâ€¦       and than to kill clearTimeout(timer)
[06:38:46] <phryk>   clearInterval(window.bfInterval);
[06:38:58] <nyk> Aamir: i corrected the issue with json2.js but it dosent make my script working :/
[06:39:39] <Aamir> phryk:  use  window.bfInterval = setIntervalâ€¦ than
[06:40:22] <phryk> Aamir: Dude, that's exactly what's standing in my codeâ€¦
[06:40:57] <Aamir> phryk:  http://gyazo.com/dbc9b10b6c028b62b417cddae1fea38c
[06:42:01] <Aamir> ?parsejson @nyk
[06:42:01] <bot-t1> nyk, jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[06:42:37] <phryk> Aamir: That's the one for resizing every 5sâ€¦ the one for going to the next div is in bfStart
[06:42:56] <Puj> phryk, bfNext is only executing once per 7.8 seconds on my browser..
[06:44:16] <nyk> that means my JSON file is incorrect?
[06:44:38] <nyk> i can't change this... it's source is elasticsearch.org :o
[06:45:26] <Aamir> nyk:  where is ur autocomplete code? :/ don't use inline js
[06:46:34] <nyk> http://pastebin.com/5Lmgv0yL
[06:47:44] <phryk> Puj: I kindof get veryâ€¦ different resultsâ€¦ A few minutes back it worked as you described it, now I get the fadein-animation two times, but the divs at least change, while before the second text was visibly only for a part of a secondâ€¦
[06:47:53] <phryk> This is friggin confusing :/
[06:48:09] <walid> xec: you still around?
[06:48:20] * xec hides
[06:49:23] <walid> oh no.. my soundcloud plugin broke again :(
[06:49:23] <Aamir> nyk: why in paste bin? where is ur js code on ur site?
[06:49:41] <Puj> phryk, I must go.  But I would make sure that you are doing your fades correctly inside of your next function and also make sure your fades don't trigger any other timeouts.  Back to the basics.
[06:50:41] <walid> hi guys, i had a soundcloud plugin working just fine an hour ago, and now i get this error:
[06:50:48] <walid> GET http://api.soundcloud.com/resolve?url=http://sebi.vbbros.net/musik 401 (Unauthorized)
[06:50:51] <phryk> Puj: Okayâ€¦ Meh - now it gets called thriceâ€¦
[06:51:17] <nyk> right inside <div class="menu_resize_bg"> symfony outs it there
[06:51:30] <nyk> Aamir:  right inside <div class="menu_resize_bg"> symfony outs it there
[06:51:39] <walid> anyidea why/how?
[06:51:54] <walid> xec: you're hiding, right..?
[06:51:55] <walid> ;)
[06:51:57] <xec> walid: whats the url to your page?
[06:52:07] <walid> http://sebi.vbbros.net/musik
[06:52:26] <walid> or rather soundblog.ch/musik
[06:57:33] <xec> walid: sry, i never used soundcloud dunno what could be causing the error, but seeing as you get a server error its probably something wrong with the request
[06:58:07] <walid> xec: the fact that it was working earlier should mean that smth is wrong on their side, maybe?
[06:59:04] <Aamir> nyk:  I don't see a reason you are using JSON.js
[06:59:15] <xec> assuming you didnt make any changes, yes
[06:59:34] <Aamir> but anyway cannot figure out why IE is not liking JSON.js in ur case
[06:59:51] <walid> xec: hm i did, but not to that, i'm pretty sure..
[07:00:01] <walid> i'll give it a day or two and check again
[07:00:09] <nyk> Aamir: it's the same with opera... =(
[07:00:50] <Aamir> ok but do it in simple way. you are complicating things. also use external js file not inline
[07:01:27] <nyk> ok, i will, sorry
[07:01:55] <xec> walid: did you make the music to that video under filmmusik?
[07:01:57] <nyk> do have have any suggestions how to debug the fault?
[07:03:22] <walid> xec: i wish. no i'm just develloping a website for a friend who need it for his master project
[07:03:43] <xec> i see, pretty cool stuff :)
[07:04:08] <walid> he needs smth simple, i really don't want to spend too much time on it
[07:04:23] <walid> takin much more than expected, as usual
[07:05:54] <neiker> Hi, anyone understand this? http://i.imgur.com/HH0rS.png
[07:06:20] <_dave_h_d> hi all, i have a script which renders a form into a div, i then add change listener for reach of the fields, immediately after i render another form and add change listeners to the fields, the problem I have is that only the second form listeners seem to be working, anyone know why?
[07:07:00] <_dave_h_d> as if the second listener nullifies the first
[07:07:58] <NodeX> ?demo @ _dave_h_d
[07:07:58] <bot-t1> _dave_h_d, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[07:10:53] <gregoryLwD> I can't stop my forms submitting
[07:11:14] <gregoryLwD> $('body').delegate("form", 'submit', function(event){     event.preventDefault();     //then do what I want...
[07:11:30] <_dave_h_d> NodeX: http://jsfiddle.net/GrwMJ/
[07:12:21] <xckpd7> if I do e.preventDefault & e.stopPropagation, couldn't I just do return: false; ?
[07:13:51] <jmaister> Can I do an .each() on an int? (short version of for(int i etc.))
[07:15:07] <walid> anyone familiar with the soundcloud api?
[07:17:03] <sorrymyeng> hi everybody, how to make it works? http://jsfiddle.net/H5cZm/
[07:18:30] <sorrymyeng> help me please
[07:19:30] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/H5cZm/1/
[07:19:31] <NodeX> lol
[07:20:19] <NodeX> the scope of "var" was only inside the doc ready function
[07:20:54] <NodeX> if you want the var and not pollute the global namespace then .. http://jsfiddle.net/H5cZm/2/
[07:21:36] <ccmonster> hey guys, got some questions about handling some data.
[07:22:26] <ccmonster> I have a variable number of inputs, which are search terms. Those input boxes with terms are used to go and fetch data from multiple Api's, which i want to aggregate.
[07:22:55] <sorrymyeng> NodeX: thank you very much:)
[07:23:05] <ccmonster> However, the user can keep dynamically adding new search boxes, from which I would go and use to aggregate
[07:23:14] <neiker> I'm trying to select an item, but jQuery does not work.. If I use document.getElementById, it works.. :S http://jsfiddle.net/GrwMJ/  http://i.imgur.com/HH0rS.png
[07:23:19] <ccmonster> what is the best way to hold this data on the front end?
[07:23:34] <ccmonster> im talking three or 4 JSON API responses with data for each search
[07:23:50] <NodeX> yw :)
[07:24:36] <Chetic> is there a problem in creating functions outside of jquery's main $(document.ready.. ?
[07:24:39] <pashmi56> hi there, i am trying to do toggle with animation function, however it is not working properly,  as: http://pastebin.com/xXC7Lw2V  , would please give me some guidance?
[07:25:47] <phlp> neiker: you need to escape . if it is part of the id '#foo\\.jpg'
[07:26:35] <neiker> phlp, thank you!!
[07:27:17] <Aamir> ccmonster: you are question is not clear. responses with data? how u add input? what action will make a request to the api. what data you are talking about to store. better make a demo on fiddle just to get an idea what you really want
[07:28:04] <gregoryLwD> argh, all the .submit, .live, .delegate documentation and the .preventDefault .stopPropegation choices is hurting my head. I think it's going to be easier to change all my forms to spans to stop the forms submitting themselves
[07:28:27] <Aamir> Chetic: depends on where you place ur function :P
[07:28:33] <Aamir> and what it do
[07:28:52] <sweetgrass> whats the best way to add 2 integers? I tried var total = $(stuffToAdd).attr('colspan') + 3, but it returns 103 instead of 13
[07:29:11] <Eviltwin> sweetgrass: parseInt($(stuffToAdd).attr('colspan')) + 3
[07:29:37] <Chetic> Aamir: well first I do an ajax call within that part before I call any functions outside, so no prob, right?
[07:30:11] <phlp> pashmi56: the function where you do animate is a callback for toggle, which means it will be called when the toggle is complete so your animate wont do much good after it's hidden
[07:30:13] <sweetgrass> Eviltwin: many thanks :)
[07:30:17] <Aamir> Chetic:  try it :S
[07:31:43] <Chetic> Aamir: I mean I just wonder if jquery is meant to all be written inside that thing (because somebody told me it is)
[07:33:23] <Aamir> Chetic:  include jQuery and ur script in head and in ur .js file enclose everything you write inside $(function(){  })  or .ready. To understand why, see ?ready
[07:33:24] <bot-t1> Chetic, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[07:35:09] <Chetic> but I want other files to see these functions too
[07:36:04] <Aamir> Chetic:  ok than just define ur functions globally ? what are you asking than?
[07:40:06] <sorrymyeng> NodeX: why this works http://jsfiddle.net/H5cZm/3/ but this http://jsfiddle.net/raqEj/ dont?
[07:40:50] <NodeX> because you are using jquery wrong
[07:41:02] <Eviltwin> As usual
[07:41:06] <NodeX> $(function).. is a shortcut for document.ready lol
[07:41:25] <NodeX> or to be more precise $(document).ready(...
[07:42:08] <NodeX> you are telling that button to .. when clicked listen for the documetn ready event and alert 1 ... well by the time you click it doc ready has already fireed lol
[07:45:26] <Jinxed-> This is a stupid question but I can't seem to host jquery and jquery-ui locally. I downloaded them off the jquery website and I tried to include them with: <script type="text/javascript" src="/includes/platform/javascript/jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.min.js"></script>
[07:47:40] <Chetic> Jinxed-: that's just jquery-ui
[07:48:20] <Jinxed-> Chetic, I also had this: <script type="text/javascript" src="/includes/platform/javascript/jquery-1.6.2.min.js"></script>
[07:49:01] <pashmi56> hi, is there one help me with very basic toggle + animate height function? it closes the menu then immedately opens it! http://pastebin.com/VavYD2aH
[07:49:10] <Aamir> Jinxed-:  in firebug HTML or Script tabs, check if these are valid urls to ur js files
[07:49:12] <sorrymyeng> NodeX: and then... http://jsfiddle.net/raqEj/1/ *confused*
[07:51:40] <Aamir> pashmi56: i think ur using toggle the wrong way. ready the docs http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[07:51:46] <NodeX> sorrymyeng : OMG lol
[07:52:27] <sorrymyeng> NodeX: what is wrong now?:)
[07:52:38] <NodeX> the way you are writing it lol
[07:55:55] <NodeX> sorrymyeng : http://jsfiddle.net/wQjkf/5/
[07:56:52] <pashmi56> Aamir: how do i define functions in it then?
[07:57:37] <pashmi56> look here: http://www.phpfreaks.com/forums/index.php?topic=252647.0
[08:00:45] <sorrymyeng> NodeX: no! i need to: button click event should be binded strongly when link is pressed, and reg_clicked() function should be wrapped by jQuery(function($) becouse i have to use .noConflict
[08:01:48] <airportyh> ic
[08:01:51] <NodeX> use what you like but you are doing ti wrong
[08:01:54] <NodeX> it*
[08:02:18] <NodeX> you seem to think that jQuery(function( .. is for noConflict
[08:02:37] <NodeX> it's not .. it's a shortcut for the doc ready events
[08:03:10] <necromancer> does jQuery make use of CORS when it's available? http://caniuse.com/cors
[08:03:19] <bjensen> lets say I have a page with some tabs, Users, Settings, Lists. How can I select of the tabs and show its contents using the url? For example www.mypage.com#Users ?
[08:03:22] <PlasmaHH> hi, can I somehow apply additional selectors to a node variable? like when I have "var xxx = $("#foo tr");" I can then later do something with xxx that would look like $("td table tr td table tr td")  if it was at the root etc. ?
[08:04:02] <djQuery1> I am getting just horrible performance with the bignumber.js that I am using. does anyone suggest a different library
[08:05:26] <djQuery1> and doing onclick= is very dry.
[08:07:09] <sorrymyeng> NodeX: >jQuery(function( .. is for noConflict..... no i dont think so. i showed you simplified part of code.
[08:07:38] <sorrymyeng> NodeX: dont redesign my code, just make it correct please?
[08:07:47] <NodeX> err no lol
[08:07:51] <NodeX> your code is bad
[08:09:45] <sorrymyeng> NodeX: so, i described my goals already, can you achieve it?
[08:10:11] <ryanneufeld> bjensen: jquery-ui tabs has support for ajax content
[08:10:32] <NodeX> I can achieve it yes but I can also write code that works
[08:10:34] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @ sorrymyeng
[08:10:34] <bjensen> ryanneufeld: Im using that already. BUt I want I want to select a specific tab using the url
[08:10:35] <bot-t1> sorrymyeng, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[08:10:37] <NodeX> and I know how
[08:10:38] <pashmi56> hello i am trying to toggle and animate as instructed here  http://jqueryui.com/demos/animate/ but for height. first click to expand to max height works fine but the second click it slides up then slides down again!!!!  thsi is my code: http://pastebin.com/xXC7Lw2V
[08:11:11] <ryanneufeld> bjensen: oic, then you would want to check the location.hash on page load, and trigger a click on that tab
[08:11:21] <sorrymyeng> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/raqEj/1/
[08:11:22] <pashmi56> sorry this is the one :http://pastebin.com/4caASXLn
[08:11:38] <bjensen> ryanneufeld: Right. Im asking about a plugin for that :)
[08:11:48] <sorrymyeng> NodeX: will you show me?
[08:11:56] <ryanneufeld> ?g jquery bbq ben alman @ bjensen
[08:11:58] <bot-t1> bjensen, Ben Alman » jQuery BBQ: Back Button & Query Library - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[08:12:18] <NodeX> sorrymyeng : I already did
[08:12:21] <gregoryLwD> is this line right to replace the action of all the forms? $('body').delegate("form", 'submit', submitForm());
[08:12:38] <ryanneufeld> sorrymyeng: why are you binding to a button onclick? That's just stupid
[08:13:06] <gregoryLwD> I then have function submitForm(event) {     event.preventDefault(); //then the stuff I want to happen...
[08:13:07] <ryanneufeld> sorrymyeng: what are you trying to accomplish with this?
[08:13:27] <ryanneufeld> ?on @ gregoryLwD
[08:13:28] <bot-t1> gregoryLwD, The new jQuery 1.7+ way of handling events: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:14:07] <gregoryLwD> ryanneufeld, oh, I'm using jquery 1.6, I guess I should upgrade
[08:14:13] <phlp> gregoryLwD: form submit doesnt bubble in ie < 9
[08:14:45] <ryanneufeld> gregoryLwD: if you can yes
[08:14:56] <gregoryLwD> phlp, what does 'bubble' mean? I saw that term used but only in jquery doc and it's never explained
[08:15:27] <phlp> gregoryLwD: also when you setup the handler dont use submitForm() you are calling the function and sending the result just do .delegate("form", 'submit', submitForm);
[08:16:15] <phlp> gregoryLwD: you are attaching the event to body which means for the event to get there from form (a child) it has to bubble (propagate) up the tree
[08:16:19] <ryanneufeld> gregoryLwD: $('body').delegate("form", 'submit', submitForm);
[08:16:28] <Tomasso> can some expression like $("#addr" + selectedStuff[i].toString()).val()   be correct?
[08:16:46] <ryanneufeld> Tomasso: yes
[08:16:55] <Tomasso> thanx xD
[08:17:43] <ryanneufeld> gregoryLwD: do you have forms dynamically added to the page?
[08:18:08] <sorrymyeng> NodeX: your http://jsfiddle.net/wQjkf/5/ does not work!
[08:18:40] <sorrymyeng> ryanneufeld: i need to: button click event should be binded strongly when link is pressed, and reg_clicked() function should be wrapped by jQuery(function($) becouse i have to use .noConflict
[08:19:07] <gregoryLwD> ryanneufeld, yes (contained in html files that get loaded into the page)
[08:19:23] <ryanneufeld> gregoryLwD: k
[08:19:57] <gregoryLwD> ryanneufeld, so I need to make sure whichever function I use to bind the submitForm function to does so for forms added in the future
[08:20:08] <ryanneufeld> gregoryLwD: yeah, you're on the right path for that
[08:20:34] <NodeX> sorrymyeng : jQuery(function($) IS NOT A WRAPPER
[08:20:53] <NodeX> jQuery() is the same as  $() ...
[08:21:20] <ryanneufeld> sorrymyeng: if you are using noConfict then it removes the reference to $ so you just use jQuery() instead of $()
[08:21:46] <NodeX> it's drupal or joomla that forces this crap lol
[08:21:46] <xckpd7> he could still do that for a plugin
[08:22:06] <NodeX> his code is asking to fire after doc.ready .. and by then doc ready has already fired
[08:22:21] <NodeX> especially because it's binding INLINE
[08:23:04] <ryanneufeld> sorrymyeng: also, binding in an onclick is super sloppy, and you shouldn't be doing it that way
[08:23:23] <NodeX>  ^ ^ which I said 25 mins ago!
[08:23:27] <ryanneufeld> NodeX: well, it would still work
[08:23:43] <ryanneufeld> if you bind to doc ready and it's already fired, it just fires it
[08:23:44] <ryanneufeld> afaik
[08:23:55] <NodeX> nope
[08:24:14] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[08:24:14] <danzik17> NodeX: yes - it uses .Callbacks( 'once memory' ) internally
[08:24:29] <NodeX> not the way he was firing it
[08:24:39] <ryanneufeld> that's trur
[08:24:41] <ryanneufeld> *true
[08:24:43] <NodeX> it may well do on a proper event driven bind
[08:24:55] <danzik17> if yea if we're talking about doing it the wrong way then sure =P
[08:24:59] <NodeX> he was telling a click to fire DOC ready and fire the funciton inside it
[08:25:00] <ryanneufeld> NodeX: the thing is the way he was doing it wasn't actually even getting to doc ready
[08:25:12] <ryanneufeld> he was just wrapping a jquery object in another one
[08:25:31] <NodeX> exactamundo ... but you "cant change his code"
[08:25:36] <NodeX> so best of luck :)
[08:25:38] <ryanneufeld> fuck him then
[08:25:42] <NodeX> hehe
[08:25:48] <ryanneufeld> That's my take on people like that
[08:25:55] <sorrymyeng> thanks you both, i will think about it morrow
[08:26:12] <ryanneufeld> "Help me do it my way, even though you're telling me it's wrong"
[08:26:28] <gregoryLwD> ryanneufeld, do I need to do event.stopPropagation(); and event.preventDefault(); ?
[08:26:41] <ryanneufeld> gregoryLwD: if you want both
[08:26:43] <ryanneufeld> just return false
[08:26:49] <ryanneufeld> That's what I do
[08:26:55] <ryanneufeld> always works for me
[08:27:27] <francois__> Hi, you guys mind if I ask a quick question?
[08:27:31] <NodeX> if you need to stop then continue .. i.e .. function(event) { return false; do some more stuff .. then it wont work
[08:27:48] <NodeX> francois__ : just ask
[08:28:55] <gregoryLwD> okay, I think I get confused in what order javacript stuff gets executed and I worry things could be happening in parallel
[08:29:19] <gregoryLwD> I'm more comftable in php (ie preprocessing stuff)
[08:30:48] <NodeX> mostly JS is async .. you can block the UI (make is sync) with certain commands
[08:31:01] <francois__> I'm adding a click function to a div then I remove() the element from its location and I'm relocating it (insertBefore()) somewhere else in the page but after that the click event handler is not working anymore. Any idea?
[08:31:12] <NodeX> or you can chain - ala Jquery and calback and stuff
[08:31:27] <NodeX> remove drops the data iirc
[08:31:31] <NodeX> the binds **
[08:31:32] <Sonderblade> anyone know of a jquery-based drop down where you can have icons to the left of the drop down choices?
[08:31:33] <NodeX> ?remove
[08:31:34] <bot-t1> .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[08:31:58] <NodeX> francois__ : look at cloning it first
[08:33:57] <phlp> francois__: just do the insertBefore without removing first. it will move with everything intact
[08:33:58] <b-lew> Can someone help me out here. I'm pretty sure its in the javascript fileâ€¦ http://mgi.turnpostadmin.com/about-us#!prettyPhoto[2]/0/ -> I can't seem to get rid of all of the white space at the bottom of the pop up
[08:35:58] <gmad> hello everybody!
[08:36:57] <gmad> I have question connected not exactly with jquery but with general javascript. Could anybody explain me difference between "==" and "==="?
[08:37:32] <gmad> I would be apprecite for short exmple...
[08:38:02] <NodeX> the latter is a strict comparison operator
[08:38:07] <gregoryLwD> hmm, how do I pass the form data (input names/values) to the function? Is it $('form').on("submit", this, submitForm); function submitForm(event, myData) {  //then use myData.serialize(); ?
[08:38:23] <Onyx47> gmad, === considers the data type as well, so true == 1 evaluates as true but true === 1 evaluates as false since one value is a boolean and other is an integer
[08:38:34] <LSymonds> $( 'id' ).val();
[08:39:38] <NodeX> gmad : http://www.javascriptkit.com/jsref/comparison_operators.shtml
[08:40:31] <xec> gmad: this might help as well: http://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-truthy-falsy/
[08:40:41] <gmad> In jEdit, which I use for programming, quite often I have error and information, that I should change == for ===, but everything is fine - app works fine
[08:41:13] <NodeX> if you use strict comparisons your script is safer
[08:43:35] <gmad> Thanks a lot for all of you...
[08:44:34] <NodeX> ;)
[08:44:51] <gmad> I do not understand example: var x=[1,2] var y=[1,2] x===y //false
[08:45:08] <gmad> For me x===y should be true
[08:45:41] <gmad> both are array with the same lenght and elements
[08:45:53] <aaronmcadam> they are different instances of objects tho
[08:46:14] <aaronmcadam> ?eval []
[08:46:15] <bot-t1> aaronmcadam: []
[08:46:19] <aaronmcadam> ?eval !![]
[08:46:20] <bot-t1> aaronmcadam: true
[08:46:27] <aaronmcadam> ?eval !![] === !![]
[08:46:27] <bot-t1> aaronmcadam: true
[08:46:41] <ryanneufeld> gregoryLwD: if you're using jquery to bind to the submit of the form. then the 'this' will be the form
[08:46:42] <nyk> could anyone try why the jquery ui autocomplete there isnt working in IE and opera (works fine in firefox) http://nyktalgia.dyndns.org/feepsSymfony/web/app.php/   (it's the search field: test with the words red or cola)
[08:46:42] <aaronmcadam> ?eval !![1,2,3] === !![1,2,3]
[08:46:43] <bot-t1> aaronmcadam: true
[08:47:42] <aaronmcadam> ?eval var x=[1,2] var y=[1,2] x===y
[08:47:42] <bot-t1> aaronmcadam: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[08:47:49] <airportyh> gmad: === does not check object equality, only value equality
[08:47:50] <aaronmcadam> ?eval var x=[1,2]; var y=[1,2]; x===y
[08:47:51] <bot-t1> aaronmcadam: false
[08:47:59] <xec> xD
[08:48:00] <airportyh> gmad: and array is an object
[08:48:33] <aaronmcadam> hm but because I've used implicit booleans there it works maybe
[08:48:48] <gmad> Yes... Both are object but they are different objects...
[08:48:55] <aaronmcadam> ?eval !![1,2,3] === !![2,3,4]
[08:48:56] <bot-t1> aaronmcadam: true
[08:48:58] <aaronmcadam> yipee
[08:49:09] <aaronmcadam> makes sense
[08:49:45] <gmad> Am I right that I can use '===' to distinguish null and '' (empty string)?
[08:49:53] <xec> ?eval [1,2,3] === [1,2,3]
[08:49:53] <bot-t1> xec: false
[08:49:54] <airportyh> gmad: different objects in memory
[08:50:07] <airportyh> gmad: correct
[08:50:13] <aaronmcadam> gmad most of the time you don't need to do that tho
[08:50:27] <gregoryLwD> hmm, it's just doing the default now and not my function
[08:50:57] <gmad> I think about solution to detect null result from $('input:text).val()
[08:51:14] <NodeX> it'll be ''
[08:51:17] <aaronmcadam> gmad: you don't need that, just $('input').val().length
[08:51:23] <NodeX> an empty string
[08:51:28] <NodeX> or that ^
[08:51:33] <aaronmcadam> if !$('input').val().length { // do something if no val
[08:52:27] <gmad> THANKS !!!
[08:53:03] <gmad> One more question... Do you know jQuery plugin jquery.iframe.transport.js?
[08:54:33] <gmad> One more question... Do you know jQuery plugin jquery.iframe-transport.js? (https://blueimp.net)
[08:58:34] <kollapse> Hi. Do these two commands in jquery have the same performance ? $('div span.test') versus $('div').find('span').find('.test')
[08:58:46] <infid> will jquery be replaced by html5 or will jquery still be a nice enhancement to it?
[08:59:14] <infid> kollapse: i'm going to guess the latter is slower, besides it's uglier so no reason to use it
[09:00:21] <airportyh> kollapse: they are actually not equivalent
[09:00:39] <airportyh> span.test means a span having the class of 'test'
[09:01:04] <airportyh> .find() finds the descendants of a given element
[09:01:15] <kollapse> Oh yes, I noticed that. But besides that, generally speaking, should both methods have the same speed ?
[09:01:53] <airportyh> try posting a test on http://jsperf.com/
[09:02:26] <aaronmcadam> haha that's such bullshit
[09:02:29] <aaronmcadam> find is faster
[09:02:38] <aaronmcadam> don't over-qualify selectors either
[09:03:33] <mrseth01> I'm animating two different DOM elements, and I'd like to when when both are complete instead of just one. Is there a standard practice for doing this. I'm doing multistep transitions for my app.
[09:03:38] <aaronmcadam> kollapse: find is usually always faster

[09:32:39] <nyk> noone any idea? =(
[09:33:08] <yedimind> about what ?
[09:33:36] <jamesarosen> larlar: what's the problem?
[09:33:40] <nyk> could anyone try why the jquery ui autocomplete there isnt working in IE and opera (works fine in firefox) http://nyktalgia.dyndns.org/feepsSymfony/web/app.php/   (it's the search field: test with the words red or cola)
[09:35:44] <rgr> whats the way to specify a selector where one component is an "or" e.g $("[class1 or class2] class3 li a")
[09:36:07] <Jon47> rgr, use a comma
[09:36:19] <Jon47> you'll have to repeat the descendent logic
[09:36:22] <larlar> jamesarosen Hi there. I threw it in a little fiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/WjeE3/1/
[09:36:29] <rgr> yeah
[09:36:30] <rgr> tanks
[09:37:23] <Jon47> you could remove the repeated code using traversals, but it will be so much uglier and slower, it'll be better to just repeat it in the selector
[09:37:29] <Guest62691> when I use delegate, the context is appearing as $(this), how do I get the individual element, not the context
[09:38:44] <Jon47> Guest62691.. I don't think that should be happening, can we see an example?
[09:40:06] <NodeX> .class1 li, .class2 li
[09:40:30] <aaronmcadam> the context *is* this
[09:41:33] <Guest62691> one sec. I'm reading that it shoudl be te target element, and not context, so yea..confused.
[09:43:27] <xckpd7> question: any jQuery plugin best practices sources?
[09:44:35] <BlankVerse> is there any option of embedding links inside the slideshow of https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-Image-Gallery
[09:44:42] <BlankVerse> or any event handler
[09:45:08] <BlankVerse> for opening a link on clicking the image while inside the slideshow
[09:45:22] <BlankVerse> current clicking on the image , takes me to the next image
[09:45:50] <BlankVerse> instead of going to the next image i want to define my own even handler
[09:46:42] <BlankVerse> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-Image-Gallery/blob/master/jquery.image-gallery.js
[09:46:56] <BlankVerse> i am unable to find the part of the code that i need to modify
[09:47:30] <larlar> BlankVerse Have you tried overiding with your own click event? =S
[09:47:46] <BlankVerse> larlar: how do i override it?
[09:48:01] <BlankVerse> larlar: can you give me an example
[09:48:39] <aaronmcadam> BlankVerse: http://www.learningjquery.com/2007/09/namespace-your-events
[09:48:56] <larlar> BlankVerse One sec. Just taking a look. Is it a plugin? If so, putting a link to your script after that should do it, in theory =S
[09:49:00] <aaronmcadam> tho implement it with on
[09:49:26] <BlankVerse> larlar: yeah its a script
[09:49:26] <Guest62691> Jon47, http://pastie.org/2862826

[09:52:30] <ccmonster> damn nickserv. grr
[09:52:54] <ccmonster> no clue why delegate is outputting the context, and not the element.
[09:53:00] <BlankVerse> larlar: ok , i got that id , but can you give me an idea what should i attach my clickhandler to ? $("a rel='gallary') ?
[09:53:09] <BlankVerse> larlar: http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-Image-Gallery/
[09:53:26] <Jon47> Guest62691 yes I see it, I', building you an example..
[09:53:51] <jscheel> hey guys, how is this still an issue? A patch was submitted two years ago: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4303
[09:53:58] <BlankVerse> larlar: on this website , on clicking any image inside the slideshow , it should instead of going to next image open a link
[09:55:05] <Jon47> ccmonster, check this out: http://jsfiddle.net/2KdL2/
[09:55:12] <Jon47> $(this) is the target selector, not the context..
[09:56:45] <ccmonster> i want to get the target
[09:57:53] <Jon47> $(this) is the target
[09:57:56] <ccmonster> so why is $(this) outputting the context in my case.
[09:58:18] <Jon47> i dunno, try extracating the salient code and putting it into a fiddle like I did
[09:58:22] <larlar> BlankVerse hmm to open in fullscreen you mean? Or to another page?
[09:58:32] <Jon47> if you make a fiddle that shows the issue, we can help you fix it
[09:58:52] <BlankVerse> $(".ui-dialog-content").click(function() {window.open ("http://www.google.com","mywindow");})
[09:58:54] <Jon47> or, more likely, the process of distilling the code into a fiddle will help you find the bug yourself ;)
[09:58:55] <BlankVerse> larlar: ^^
[09:59:11] <BlankVerse> larlar: to open a link in new window
[09:59:11] <phlp> ccmonster: your console.log is inside the bind, not the delegate. your bind call knows nothing about what you sent to delegate (target selector)
[09:59:38] <BlankVerse> larlar: try this function on the website http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-Image-Gallery/
[09:59:47] <BlankVerse> larlar: it doesnt persist for all images
[09:59:57] <BlankVerse> larlar: i want it to persist for all images
[10:01:30] <BlankVerse> larlar: is the ui-dialog-content class destroyed/re-inserted at each next image?
[10:03:36] <larlar> BlankVerse I'd assume so
[10:03:53] <BlankVerse> larlar: how to select multiple classes using $
[10:04:12] <larlar> BlankVerse $('class1, class2, class3')
[10:05:00] <larlar> BlankVerse You want to open a new page when user clicks on large image instead of continuing through the slideshow? Make sure I'm getting it right :P
[10:05:05] <BlankVerse> larlar: can you find a class which persists ?
[10:05:08] <BlankVerse> larlar: yep , right
[10:05:17] <ccmonster> phlp, you are correct. Thanks for the heads up
[10:05:29] <ccmonster> thanks for helping out as well Jon47
[10:05:34] <BlankVerse> larlar: or maybe when the user presses the enter key ..
[10:06:18] <larlar> BlankVerse How about putting the link near the title, or at the bottom of the large image window?
[10:06:45] <BlankVerse> larlar: that would be awesome , but the link will depend in the current image
[10:06:51] <larlar> BlankVerse Then they can still go through the slide as well as that
[10:07:02] <BlankVerse> larlar: awesome , how do i do that?
[10:08:00] <larlar> BlankVerse You could either have the title as the link (you'd have to make that very obvious) or place it at the side
[10:09:18] <larlar> BlankVerse You'd have to add the info in a new HTML span or something, and make sure to add the relavent JS to account for the extra info
[10:10:23] <larlar> BlankVerse If you add an attribute to the text or image with the link - that might be possible - then call up the value of the attribute in the JS
[10:10:39] <Jinxed-> Can someone please tell me how I would change these sources from google to my local sources (jquery and jquery-ui). http://paste2.org/p/1777454  The paste has the working google references for script, but the local references are listed on the bottom which don't work.
[10:11:21] <kollapse> Hi. I have a text input element with a lot of text in it. How do I scroll the input to the end of itself ?
[10:12:37] <larlar> BlankVerse Or like this - http://jsfiddle.net/hMrZ4/2/ - am I making sense? lol :P
[10:13:13] <larlar> BlankVerse ..and give it a class with display:none
[10:16:15] <BlankVerse> larlar: link will be a function of the current image src
[10:16:58] <larlar> BlankVerse So it opens the image in a new page?
[10:17:09] <BlankVerse> larlar: how does it matter?
[10:17:21] <BlankVerse> click(function() {window.open ("http://www.google.com","mywindow");})
[10:17:31] <BlankVerse> i want to have something like this
[10:17:45] <BlankVerse> but the url is actually variable
[10:17:54] <BlankVerse> it would depend on the current img src
[10:18:01] <LSymonds> Blank
[10:18:08] <LSymonds> why not give the img src a name attribute
[10:18:17] <BlankVerse> lets say that it is equal to the current img src
[10:18:21] <LSymonds> and then var name = $( '#img' ).attr( 'name' )
[10:18:52] <BlankVerse> LSymonds: and then?
[10:19:08] <larlar> BlankVerse LSymonds yeah, like that. That's what I was thinking :)
[10:19:26] <larlar> LSymonds Something like that anyway xD
[10:20:59] <larlar> The code for it looks a bit heavy for what it's doing =/
[10:21:07] <larlar> The gallery I mean
[10:21:38] <BlankVerse> larlar: suggest some alternative gallery ?
[10:21:49] <nyk> could anyone try why the jquery ui autocomplete there isnt working in IE and opera (works fine in firefox) http://nyktalgia.dyndns.org/feepsSymfony/web/app.php/   (it's the search field: test with the words red or cola) Could anyone debug this in IE and tell me whats wrong? please =(
[10:21:52] <BlankVerse> larlar: that is faster than this?
[10:22:04] <larlar> BlackVerse If you want the image to open in a new window when clicked just delete the e.preventDefault() at line83
[10:22:26] <puppen> Heya, just wondering if anyone knows how to display fancybox's left/right nav buttons with youtube videos.. I'm having a tinker (added to config, set massive z-indexes) but not having much luck :(
[10:23:09] <larlar> BlackVerse You could build your own :P
[10:23:35] <BlankVerse> larlar: that opens the image on clicking on the thumbnail itself , i want it to open image only when it is large!!
[10:28:05] <larlar> BlackVerse Yikes! Don't do that then lol umm You could include it in the HTML then add a line or two of JS to display that link in the large image window
[10:30:34] <larlar> BlackVerse or add an <a> inside the title <span> ..or whatever it is
[10:31:59] <ccmonster> you cannot attach data() to an obj until it's on the DOM?
[10:44:18] <xckpd7> can anyone explain why I get an error with this code (too much recursion): http://jsfiddle.net/7WGSg/
[10:44:59] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: Because inside your click listener, you're telling it to click itself
[10:45:26] <Eviltwin> When you do a .click(function(e){...}) inside the ..., the this refers to the thing that was clicked
[10:45:42] <Eviltwin> In other words $(this).hide() and $(this).click() are referring to different this's
[10:46:05] <Eviltwin> ?.proxy @ xckpd7
[10:46:06] <bot-t1> xckpd7, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[10:46:34] <Eviltwin> Read that page
[10:46:39] <xckpd7> whoa whoa haha I thought I was binding the click element to the element I was creating on the fly
[10:47:08] <mattyh88> hey, what does the $active mean in this http://pastebin.com/8sErcZgS code?
[10:47:10] <xckpd7> I want the newly created element to trigger a click on the element I"m hding
[10:47:32] <mattyh88> i've never seen something like $varname in jquery before
[10:47:49] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: I'm reading the page now, thanks
[10:48:05] <bot-t1> mattyh88, It is a common convention to prefix variables that refer to jQuery objects with a $ (Ex. var $this = $(this). The $ has NO SPECIAL MEANING and is simply customary among some developers. Others object to it on the grounds that it is "Hungarian Notation." Feel free to use it or not!
[10:50:03] <devc> I'm trying to fix a bug for a project I'm working on. as a pre-warning: This will most likely take someone an investment of time to see how things work -- When the user clicks "next page" then "prev page" before next page has loaded, it handles itself but if you click, prev, next, prev, next, next, prev, prev, prev, next it can't cope and you need to reload the site.
[10:51:15] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: just figured out what you were trying to explain... so inside the click function, the this click is referring to the element just created, creating an infinite loop... thanks for the explanation
[10:51:54] <marekweb> devc: when you click that exact sequence?
[10:52:13] <mattyh88> so $active should be a jquery object in my case? hmm .. i'm doing this: http://www.sohtanaka.com/web-design/automatic-image-slider-w-css-jquery/ but can't find out why $active can't be found (chrome debug bar is telling me that)
[10:52:31] <devc> marekweb: No, just demonstrating that if you click way ahead of the actual animations, it has a problem.
[10:53:06] <marekweb> devc: you could try disabling the click handlers while the animation is in progress
[10:53:47] <devc> marekweb: Yeah, I tried that -- the problem is the animation is actually a set of dynamic animations... as few as 14 or as many as infinity, essentially
[10:54:00] <mattyh88> ah found it, nevermind :)
[10:54:05] <phlp> devc: are you stopping anims on click? if not they will stack up http://api.jquery.com/stop
[10:54:51] <devc> marekweb: So I iterate through an array of objects with .each() but there's no way to know exactly when the last animation ends.
[10:55:25] <devc> marekweb: Hmm -- perhaps I could add an if statement within my .each() and check if .length of the array = the iterator?
[10:55:37] <tyrone> hi people. I have  a .get query that results in a table row being changed. immediately afterwards I call another .get which retrieves an update based on changes made in the previous .get. why would it be that my answers are always 1 behind?
[10:57:08] <Onyx47> tyrone, if you're calling the second .get outside the first .get's callback it's probably firing too soon
[10:57:29] <tyrone> Onyx47 so I should nest them?
[10:57:54] <Onyx47> tyrone, yes, that's the safest way since you're dealing with asynchronous calls
[10:58:16] <tyrone> Onyx47 awesome thanks so much. I'll try that
[10:59:20] <ccmonster> hmm, a function that calls a getJSON which retuns the json object is showing up as undefined, yet a log out within the JSON object shows the data which is suppose to be returned
[11:00:28] <ccmonster> i assume when I try to log it out its 'not there' , but how do I ensure it will be
[11:02:03] <xckpd7> question: is it a best practice to cache $(this) inside of plugins as well? e.g. var $this = $(this);
[11:02:27] <tyrone> Onyx47: does't seem to have worked. this is how I have it at the moment (nested) till behaves the same http://dpaste.com/656368/
[11:02:39] <tyrone> Onyx47 mind having a look?
[11:03:07] <ccmonster> usually do var self = $(this)
[11:03:15] <ccmonster> i think that is standard, but its all the same
[11:03:37] <xckpd7> but inside of plugins too?
[11:05:33] <ccmonster> yes. i think ajpiano has a 'widget' walkthrough with best practices
[11:05:44] <ccmonster> ?

[11:06:33] <ccmonster> aight. i quit lol
[11:06:36] <xckpd7> haha
[11:06:40] <phlp> http://jqueryboilerplate.com
[11:07:10] <ccmonster> hey phlp , any clue why i can log out my response INSIDE my getJSON function, yet if i log out what that getJSON returns, it is undefined
[11:07:15] <Dragoon> Anyone has used the GameQuery library ?
[11:07:21] <xckpd7> yeah I'm having difficulty doing the caching there.... I'll leave it until I find some best practices resources
[11:08:22] <ccmonster> phlp, http://pastie.org/2862826
[11:08:27] <Onyx47> tyrone, from what I can gather without HTML is that you have <tr>s with specific IDs and then <td>s with IDs such as #id-description?
[11:09:28] <phlp> ccmonster: cant use ajax like that. getFreebaseData will return immediately and not wait for the getJSON
[11:09:57] <ccmonster> ah, that's what I figured.
[11:10:05] <ccmonster> could I return the object?
[11:10:17] <ccmonster> and it would stil work since the handler is attached to hit?
[11:10:34] <phlp> http://danheberden.com/presentations/deferreds-putting-laziness-to-work
[11:10:50] <ccmonster> oh joy. not sure what Im about to read lol
[11:10:52] <tyrone> Onyx47 the id_descriptions are input fields. I click the edit button, the row turns to input form, I click save and the form is submitted to the server. the update happens and then the call to get the new total is sent
[11:11:56] <devc> marekweb: It was a little more involved that I hoped, but I got it working. Thanks for getting dialogue going between us .
[11:12:03] <devc> That helped me come up with a solution.
[11:12:05] <ccmonster> is deferred apart of jquery or this something else?
[11:12:19] <Onyx47> tyrone, well, in any case I'm getting the impression that you have multiple elements with same id? Might not be your specific problem but you should use classes for that since ids are supposed to be unique
[11:12:46] <phlp> ccmonster: it's built in http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object
[11:13:53] <tyrone> Onyx47 ok. but it doesn't seem that that is the issue since it works sometimes, sometimes not and sometimes just one result behind. do you think it might be a caching issue?
[11:14:07] <ccmonster> interesting.
[11:14:16] <ccmonster> however its talking about $.when now
[11:14:34] <b0ot> What is the best way to read an XML file with jquery?
[11:14:35] <imsky> mmmmmmonday
[11:15:45] <tyrone> Onyx47.... sorry nevermind I was being stupid. I forgot to repeat the get inside the other if braces since I was nesting. seems to be working now. thanks
[11:15:45] <mrseth01> here's another article that's helpful for deferred objects: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptjunkie/gg723713
[11:15:47] <tyrone> :)
[11:16:13] <Onyx47> tyrone, lots of braces, happens :)
[11:16:56] <tyrone> Onyx47... yes, one should brace one's self for such incidents :P
[11:17:00] <tyrone> sorry had to :)
[11:20:13] <ccmonster> hey phlp , is $.when already available in 1.64?
[11:20:28] <Eviltwin> ?.when @ ccmonster
[11:20:29] <bot-t1> ccmonster, jQuery.when(deferreds): Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[11:20:30] <phlp> yes it's from 1.5
[11:20:39] <Eviltwin> "version added: 1.5"
[11:21:09] <ccmonster> that's awesome.
[11:21:12] <ccmonster> quite handy
[11:22:01] <turboneat> whats the best content slider plugin?
[11:26:43] <ccmonster> hey phlp , not getting anything out of this - maybe I misunderstood the $.when, http://pastie.org/2862826
[11:27:00] <Eviltwin> ccmonster: return $.getJSON
[11:27:06] <Eviltwin> Not just $.getJSON
[11:27:21] <brettfrable> hey room
[11:27:28] <brettfrable> i'm getting no response in the css room
[11:27:38] <brettfrable> would someone be willing to take a css related question?
[11:27:46] <Eviltwin> Depends on what it is
[11:27:47] <ccmonster> huh Eviltwin ?
[11:27:58] <ccmonster> fire and forget, brettfrable
[11:27:58] <brettfrable> http://pastie.org/2863187
[11:28:09] <brettfrable> for whatever reason
[11:28:22] <brettfrable> when viewing this site on ie7 and ie8
[11:28:27] <ccmonster> return the whole $.getJSON obj Eviltwin ?
[11:28:32] <brettfrable> the main nav removes the visited links

[11:28:48] <brettfrable> there is a live example.
[11:28:58] <ccmonster> k
[11:28:59] <Eviltwin> ccmonster: Look who's talking...
[11:29:12] <ccmonster> haha. :)
[11:29:53] <Eviltwin> ccmonster: What's the return value of $.getJSON
[11:30:15] <ccmonster> its a large json object , or should be. however, its not showing up inside the done()
[11:30:26] <brettfrable> any ideas?
[11:31:03] <Eviltwin> ccmonster: What's the return value of jQuery.getJSON
[11:31:08] <Eviltwin> For any case, any time, anywhere
[11:31:17] <Eviltwin> Regardless of what you're fetching
[11:31:28] <ccmonster> Eviltwin, ok, returned the whole $.getJSON(url,{key:val}); and now its working
[11:32:11] <ccmonster> json object with two objects : 'contents', 'status'
[11:32:11] <Eviltwin> You understand that $.getJSON is an asynchronous call, right?
[11:32:15] <ccmonster> yes, I do
[11:32:33] <Eviltwin> You understand that the return value for something that makes an asynchronous call cannot be the data you were requesting, right?
[11:33:00] <ccmonster> yes. What are you trying to say though?
[11:33:09] <Eviltwin> That $.getJSON doesn't return your data
[11:33:14] <Eviltwin> It returns something else instead
[11:33:22] <Eviltwin> A jqXHR
[11:33:35] <Eviltwin> Which implements the Promise interface
[11:33:49] <Eviltwin> $.when(...) accepts a series of Promise objects
[11:33:52] <BlankVerse> any way to use markdown to write presentation using deck.js
[11:33:52] <ccmonster> ok. So returning the whole jqXHR object gives me that
[11:33:56] <BlankVerse> http://imakewebthings.github.com/deck.js/
[11:34:08] <Eviltwin> What do you mean "the whole jqXHR object"?
[11:34:29] <ccmonster> returning $.getJSON() allows $.when() to interface with its promise?
[11:34:59] <brettfrable> no help i see
[11:34:59] <Eviltwin> Short answer: Yes
[11:35:02] <ccmonster> lol
[11:35:19] <ccmonster> each jqHXR obj has a promise correct?
[11:35:26] <phlp> brettfrable: have you tried removing some of the css to find out which one is causing it?
[11:36:20] <ccmonster> well, you're holding back the 'Long Answer', or even the "Abridged Long Answer' for some reason.
[11:36:20] <zkirill> Is there a plugin for changing a displayed number in an airport-ticker style or something along those lines? (doesn't just change the number)
[11:36:23] <Eviltwin> ccmonster: Yes and that jqXHR has *nothing* to do with your data
[11:36:46] <ccmonster> feel free to coach me up , man. I know nothing, as far as im concerned.

[11:37:40] <brettfrable> i didn't id the visited in slidelist

[11:38:07] <ccmonster> and its on a :visited, so its even odder
[11:38:08] <phlp> Eviltwin: that does appear to be it although that wasnt in your original paste and it doesnt relate to the menu

[11:43:38] <supsup> cool it's just /msg bot-t1 ~~ who would of guessed.
[11:43:48] <ccmonster> that top part is not what I have. one sec. I will update that so you can see what I did.
[11:44:01] <Hopsy> eval (function(i,j,e,s,z){while(i--){s+=String.fromCharCode(z[i])}return[s.split(e)[j]("-"),s,s,s][j](" ")})(4,"join","","",[83,84,69,74])
[11:44:06] <Hopsy> ?eval (function(i,j,e,s,z){while(i--){s+=String.fromCharCode(z[i])}return[s.split(e)[j]("-"),s,s,s][j](" ")})(4,"join","","",[83,84,69,74])

[11:44:18] <ccmonster> Eviltwin, there you go : http://pastie.org/2862826
[11:44:26] <ccmonster> and Eviltwin , thanks for the help.
[11:44:57] <daed> eviltwin; TL tweets about you a lot :P
[11:45:28] <djQuery1> Anyone know of a plugin for grouping on a table?
[11:45:34] <ccmonster> data tables
[11:45:41] <ccmonster> ?datatables
[11:45:42] <bot-t1> ccmonster, DataTables | jQuery Plugins - Freestyle Grid http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/datatables
[11:45:44] <Eviltwin> ccmonster: So why are you trying to put the Promise in an element .data?
[11:46:14] <ccmonster> wasn't trying to put the promise, rather the resulting data from the $.getJSON request
[11:46:45] <phlp> ccmonster: you're passing r to .data but never set the value
[11:47:06] <Eviltwin> This code is very strange
[11:47:43] <ccmonster> its a hodge podge paste.
[11:47:49] <ccmonster> which is a problem in itself.
[11:48:09] <ccmonster> let me clean it up. sorry
[11:49:13] <danzik17> can anyone spot what i'm doing wrong in simulating a keyEvent here?  http://jsfiddle.net/VSEzU/3/ - this is for some unit tests which is why i'm explicitly using native events, not jQuery trigger.  the keyCode isn't set properly when it hits the dispatchEvent codepath
[11:49:31] <EJFox> Hello, I am trying to grab every span on my page with the class color number [ var colornumber = $('.colornumber') ] and then I want to take the content of that span and put it in an array [ var number1 = colornumber[1].val() ] - But I get the error "Object #<HTMLSpanElement> has no method 'val'
[11:50:13] <EJFox> soâ€¦ I guess to simplify my question- I have an array that's line [<span>3</span, <span>10</span>,<span>20</span>] How do I access the numbers inside the spans?
[11:50:28] <phlp> ? .text @ EJFox
[11:50:29] <bot-t1> EJFox, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[11:50:47] <EJFox> That was the other thing I tried
[11:50:49] <EJFox> same thing
[11:50:50] <EJFox> "Object #<HTMLSpanElement> has no method 'text'"
[11:51:21] <phlp> EJFox: colornumber.eq(1).text()
[11:51:36] <EJFox> What is .eq(1) ?
[11:51:42] <phlp> ? .eq @ EJFox
[11:51:43] <bot-t1> EJFox, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[11:51:44] <ccmonster> Ok, cleaned it up a bit Eviltwin and phlp - http://pastie.org/2862826
[11:52:15] <EJFox> Awesome, thanks a ton phlp.
[11:52:32] <EJFox> Why did .eq(1) work but not colornumbers[1] ?
[11:53:00] <phlp> the second returns the dom element like .get
[11:54:35] <tomasm-> hi, i have several multi-layered images on top of each other, and i set a click handler, but for some reason the click only registers on the outer container and not the items inside it.... there's even a div that has position: relative; overflow: hidden; .... and this doesnt get called in the click stack (only it's parent does). any idea why?
[11:54:54] <phlp> ccmonster: are you sure instance has been set from your focus event at that point?
[11:55:10] <ccmonster> yes. when I log out, I can see the 'instance'
[11:55:58] <ccmonster> let me log out the instance within the .done()
[11:56:01] <ccmonster> see what i get
[11:57:00] <ccmonster> ah there it is. For some reason I was expected to see it on the element tag
[12:01:59] <hackeron> hey, question - $("#live_layout")[0].style.width returns "680px" -- but when I try to do $("#live_layout")[0].style.width('900px') - it says TypeError: $("#live_layout")[0].style.width is not a function -- how comes? - how do I change the width?
[12:02:53] <ccmonster> how would I do multiple $.when() where i am deferring until 3 diff json requests finish?
[12:02:59] <PERECil> hackeron: you're doing it wrong.
[12:03:24] <PERECil> $( '#live_layout' ).css( 'width', '900px' );
[12:04:07] <tomasm-> hackeron, prop('width') or css('width') is the right way
[12:04:10] <tomasm-> i think
[12:04:21] <tomasm-> style.width is just a variable, it's not a function
[12:05:08] <hackeron> tomasm-: PERECil: Thank you, trying :)
[12:05:16] <hackeron> tomasm-: what's the difference between prop and css?
[12:05:31] <Woet> ?.prop @ hackeron
[12:05:31] <bot-t1> hackeron, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[12:05:33] <Woet> ?.css @ hackeron
[12:05:34] <bot-t1> hackeron, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[12:05:39] <ccmonster> diff way of setting , getting
[12:05:54] <danzik17> ccmonster: just do $.when( dfr1, dfr2, dfr3).done( function(data1, data2, data3) { ... });
[12:06:01] <Woet> hackeron: .prop is alt/title/href/rel/value etc
[12:06:16] <ccmonster> you can also do $('myElement').css({width:'900px',height:'300px'}) etc
[12:06:22] <Woet> hackeron: .css is font-size, position: relative, etc.
[12:06:32] <ccmonster> nice danzik17 awesome.
[12:06:35] <ccmonster> that's a win right there :)
[12:06:39] <hackeron> Woet: ah, got ya! - thanks :)
[12:10:32] <jbrokc> what's the right event for determining if an input field has had it's value changed? I bound it to the keydown event, but that happens before the value is entered which isn't very useful.
[12:10:53] <hackeron> Hmm, it seems when I do $("#live_layout").css('height', '640px') -- my aspect ratio is not followed on my resizeable object -- is there a call to resizeable to resize instead of using css?
[12:11:19] <b0ot> danzik17, do you know how to parse xml with jquery?
[12:11:46] <danzik17> @b0ot see ?parseXML
[12:11:46] <bot-t1> b0ot, jQuery.parseXML(data): Parses a string into an XML document. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[12:12:34] <b0ot> danzik17, the problem I have is that instead of something like <car> to search for with the find() I have something like <car id=1>
[12:13:01] <phlp> jbrokc: .change but it only fires after the input loses focus. there is also keyup which will have the value already updated inside the callback
[12:13:03] <ccmonster> .change?
[12:13:58] <danzik17> b0ot: does using .find('car[id="1"]') work?  i don't typically parse XML with jQuery.
[12:14:00] <ccmonster> context.delegate('keyup change',function(e){}) ...or so..
[12:14:23] <ccmonster> forgot the target element in there. oops lol
[12:14:27] <ccmonster> ignore that
[12:14:57] <jbrokc> phlp: what actually solved the issue was using 'keyup' instead :)
[12:16:06] <b0ot> danzik17, i'm just starting out... so i'm open to suggestions. I'm trying to build a drag and drop configuration tool with a starting point of this: http://www.elated.com/articles/drag-and-drop-with-jquery-your-essential-guide/ Essentially I will make a config via drag and drop and then I want to be able read and write it to xml files.
[12:17:19] <danzik17> b0ot: i'd recommend just reading and writing from JSON files unless you have some hard dependency.  you're going to find it easier to work with in JS.
[12:18:51] <b0ot> danzik17, unfortunetly everything is already built already to use xml files, I saved the UI until last
[12:19:20] <b0ot> if I could go back I would do it with json... but I don't want to convert between the two
[12:20:30] <danzik17> b0ot: well, that's a longer discussion than i can have while i'm at work.  but in that case, see if jquery's attribute selectors work on xml ( dont know if they do ).  if they don't,  you may need to explicitly use .filter
[12:22:53] <cronin> how do you change the value of a data attribute?
[12:23:02] <Stereo> how would you create many buttons that all have the same name, but apply to different objects, so that they do their action over ajax?
[12:23:16] <Stereo> for example I have a table of text, and each line has a delete button
[12:30:05] <jtascher> Hey, I'm trying to create a parallex effect by changing background position on a scroll event, hoping someone could give me some tips:  http://jsfiddle.net/FuuvH/1/
[12:31:43] <hackeron> hey, can anyone tell me how to tell a resizable object to resize programatically? - I tried .css('width','100%') but that breaks aspect ratio
[12:31:53] <romulo> hi there, can anyone telll me how to retrieve the html string from a Image() object?
[12:33:05] <Rembane> hackeron: Calculate the ratio and resize accordingly
[12:34:29] <hackeron> Rembane: how? -- .css({'width': '100%', 'height': 'ratio_to_width_of:4/3'}) ? - what is the syntax?
[12:36:09] <cronin> how do you replace a data attribute on click? i've tried things like $('.button').data('issue', 'hello'); and it doesn't work
[12:38:05] <hackeron> Rembane: also, if I do that, the resize helper at the bottom right of the div stays where it was while the div underneath it gets bigger
[12:42:31] <ragas> ive got a login page (login.aspx) that cant be duplicated, but i need to render it in 2 different ways, depending on which link was clicked to get there.  can i do that with the identity of the image clicked  as a referrer?
[12:44:57] <ccmonster> identity ?
[12:45:18] <gesman> Hello all
[12:45:29] <gesman> Q: why alert is never called here: jQuery('<div id="blah"></div>'); jQuery('#blah').each(function(){ alert('Found!'); });
[12:47:53] <phlp> gesman: jQuery('<div id="blah"></div>').appendTo('body');
[12:47:56] <devc> gesman: is the div empty?
[12:48:27] <gesman> devc, i could make it not, but it still won't work: jQuery('<div id="blah">BLAH!</div>'); jQuery('#blah').each(function(){ alert('Found!'); });
[12:48:30] <b0ot> how do i know if a function is running?
[12:48:57] <devc> gesman: $('div.blah').each(function(){ alert('Found!'); }); would work -- your page CANNOT have more than one element with the same ID, so you need to use classes if there's many.
[12:50:38] <gesman> devc, well this one alert: 'null' : jQuery('<div id="blah">BLAH!</div>'); alert(document.getElementById('blah'));
[12:50:40] <datlap> i m using bootstrap-tabs.js and created 2 tabs a,b. the link is site.com/help. how do i refer to tab b from another page? what is the url?
[12:51:52] <gesman> phlp, thanks! sorry, missed your reply first time...
[12:51:56] <hightekvagabond> gesman, just doing jQuery('<div></div>') does not create a div in your document, you need to append it so that it is attached and exists
[12:51:58] <gesman> your version works!
[12:52:09] <gesman> hightekvagabond, yes!
[12:54:50] <hightekvagabond> So, I've been digging through the ajax docs for the last hour trying to figure out if there is a way for the callback function to know what data was actually sent for the post, I was hoping to find it in the jqxhr object but it doesn't seem to be there, is there a native way to do this or do I need to write an extension? Or does an extension already exist that does?
[12:55:46] <ryanneufeld> hightekvagabond: no, there is no way to do that. However, if you craft your code well, you should have access to it any way
[12:55:57] <ryanneufeld> hightekvagabond: by using a var in the right place
[12:56:18] <hightekvagabond> could you please elaborate ryan?
[12:56:43] <ryanneufeld> hightekvagabond: are you familiar with caching variables?
[12:56:45] <tomasm-> hi, is there a way to have a callback on an image after it's done loading? is there a 'load' event?
[12:57:05] <ryanneufeld> tomasm-: yes, there is a load event for images
[12:57:10] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ hightekvagabond
[12:57:11] <bot-t1> hightekvagabond, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:57:37] <phz> I'll have to make a chart with live streaming data, just found this amazing lib http://smoothiecharts.org/ that uses html5 canvas but know what do you guys recommend me to make the communication, I thought of html5's websocket api or json but I dont know either of them yet
[13:05:49] <hightekvagabond> ryan, sorry for the delay, boss needed something:  http://jsfiddle.net/AbDbJ/
[13:06:04] <tomasm-> has anyone here used FLOT, and can compare it to Open Flash Chart at all?
[13:06:38] <hdon> hi all :) i am using .hide().slideDown() to make new LI appear in my UL. it appears though that smooth expansion of the LIs (as they appear from 0px tall) only lasts until the first line of text, then it is no longer smooth animation. is there a work-around?
[13:08:13] <tomasm-> hdon, i dont really know, but slideDown() etc may only really work well on block elements. if it's an inline, it has no explicit height to perhaps calculate appropriate smooth transitioning... just a wild guess though. maybe put a div or a p inside the LI and slideDown() on those?
[13:09:37] <hdon> tomasm-: hmm, not a bad idea, thank you :)
[13:09:49] <hdon> my thinking about why it might not work was quite similar
[13:10:10] <hdon> maybe i should just make them divs, i'm not really using any features of the <ul> anyhow it's just semantic-web habit :|
[13:10:20] <hdon> display isn't inline it's whatever the default <li> display is
[13:11:16] <tomasm-> yeah, but its not block.... list-item or something
[13:18:26] <josh9> anyone know of a carousel i can use that have 2 rows and can be loaded dynamically? similar to this - http://jsfiddle.net/hNTTc/29/
[13:19:41] <Ortix> i have this piece of code:

[13:19:50] <Chopps> hi guys, i have a heavy page that takes a few secs to load completely, and while its loading the page suffers some changes cause of js, and i dont want the users to see that.. so, is there a way to load the page in the background while a loading image or msg is being showed and after load is ready display the fully loaded page?
[13:19:52] <Ortix> how do i encodie the filepath to md5
[13:19:57] <Ortix> i already have the md5 plugin loaded
[13:20:04] <Ortix> quite new to jquery
[13:20:08] <Ortix> and its syntax
[13:20:39] <Krambfhase> not sure there is a md5 plugin for jQuery :/
[13:22:29] <OutLook> hi is it possible to catch onChange event in ANY control on page with jQuery
[13:23:25] <stakkit> hi
[13:23:29] <OutLook> to be more precise, I wont to catch is user made any change on page
[13:23:55] <hightekvagabond> you mean any changes to form fields right?
[13:24:08] <OutLook> yes
[13:24:19] <OutLook> any change on any control in form
[13:24:46] <Ortix> there is
[13:24:51] <Ortix> i found it :)
[13:25:01] <OutLook> please share it :)
[13:25:09] <hightekvagabond> off the top of my head it would be something like $(document).find('input').on('change',callback);

[13:25:36] <afink> Hello everyone, I am having a mental malfunction, when using $.post you can pass an array to php without an special treatment can't you?
[13:25:50] <ryanneufeld> hightekvagabond: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/AbDbJ/1/ I just formatted it and switched to using .done
[13:25:58] <ryanneufeld> but that should work afaik
[13:27:34] <stakkit> ??
[13:27:47] <Krambfhase> ?serializeArray @ afink
[13:27:47] <bot-t1> afink, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[13:28:06] <Krambfhase> not sure that work with post, though
[13:28:06] <ccmonster> md5 of a string. Whats the best route?
[13:28:38] <Ortix> ok nvm guys i already figured it out. I'll just use the repsonse from the php file :D
[13:28:41] <Ortix> gotta love jquery
[13:28:43] <Ortix> so intuitive! :D
[13:28:52] <OutLook> @hightekvagabond you sugesting exacly the thing i wont to avoid, to catche onChange event on every single control on page. I've hoped that thare is solution to catch ANY CHANGE ON ANY CONTROL on page
[13:30:21] <Krambfhase> $(document).change() :o
[13:30:43] <OutLook> wrily?
[13:31:36] <Krambfhase> well, yeah. the .change() event bubbles up till document, so you can just catch it there
[13:32:47] <OutLook> what a nice language :)
[13:33:02] <OutLook> thanks man, you've been healpful
[13:34:48] <hightekvagabond> @ryanneufeld, thanks
[13:35:15] <Krambfhase> np
[13:35:29] <ryanneufeld> hightekvagabond: np, I think you had it right to start with
[13:35:45] <ryanneufeld> hightekvagabond: the only thing I changed was using the promise that get's returned
[13:37:06] <hightekvagabond> yeah, the honest answer is that my code calling that function was wrong and it was passing undefined for row number, so when I alerted the rownumber I thought it was putting it out of scopeâ€¦. I was being a dumbass
[13:37:52] <hightekvagabond> I was mostly thanking you for taking the time to at least point out to me that my original assumption that the variable was in scope was right
[13:41:44] <ryanneufeld> hightekvagabond: hah, I've been there before
[13:44:01] <Gorkyman> is anyone here using datepick ?

[13:48:27] <stakkit> Hello everyone!
[13:48:38] <stakkit> i have a problem with isotope.. can anyone help me please?!
[13:48:40] <Krambfhase> Chopps: fight the FOUC.
[13:48:41] <hightekvagabond> Chopps,  have you checked out the .load() function?
[13:49:09] <stakkit> please..
[13:49:25] <bot-t1> stakkit, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:49:31] <Samian> hey
[13:49:35] <Samian> can someone try if ftp://fleet.ece.gatech.edu/ works?
[13:50:21] <Chopps> ive used load, but i dont think it does what i need, im going to read more about it though
[13:52:05] <hightekvagabond> Samian, I get no response from that ftp server either on ftp or ping
[13:52:25] <stakkit> ok.. i have this problem with isotope: i click on a filter only one time. here my website: http://stakk.it/
[13:52:47] <Chopps> Krambfhase, its not fouc, i have a tab system based on js, but when page is loading, it will load the contents of all tabs on the same tab, a few secs later, the content goes to the correct tab, and i dont want the user to see that
[13:54:07] <stakkit> why?
[13:54:42] <Krambfhase> Chopps: hide all tabs at hte start and the show them on a need-to-do basis
[13:54:51] <stakkit> why i click on a filter only one time?
[13:55:06] <stakkit> *i can
[13:55:33] <Chopps> but all the tabs are needed Krambfhase :S so i cant hide them
[13:55:38] <phlp> stakkit: because the selected class is not removed when a different filter is clicked
[13:55:48] <Krambfhase> dont get it :|
[13:56:49] <stakkit> @phlp: and how can I remove it?
[13:58:08] <fcastro> hi
[13:59:13] <fcastro> It's possible to map all elements like DFS in a tree?
[13:59:23] <phlp> stakkit: in jquery.custom.js inside $optionLinks.click callback you need to do $optionLinks.removeClass('selected')
[13:59:39] <fcastro> I wan't to set "max_height" for all elements contained into a particular element
[14:01:00] <Krambfhase> fcastro: all jqueryfunction can take a function as a parameter. but you might also have a look at http://www.google.de/search?q=jquery+plugin+equal+height
[14:01:24] <ravenzz> .foo * { max-height:100%; }   $('elem').addClass('foo');
[14:01:37] <fcastro> Krambfhase: thanks bro
[14:01:46] <fcastro> ravenzz: it's a good idea too :)
[14:03:44] <stakkit> @phlp: Thank you phlp! i solved the problem! :)
[14:08:20] <xckpd7> question: do you need to check that elements exist before you run stuff on them? I've created some jQuery plugins for some of my stuff but I'm wondering if anything bad will happen if those elements don't exist
[14:08:31] <bakers> xckpd7: No you should be ok
[14:08:44] <bakers> xckpd7: What do you mean when you say "run stuff on them"
[14:09:19] <xckpd7> $('.element_that_might_exist').customPlugin();
[14:09:40] <hightekvagabond> yeah, that should just return a list of zero objects to run the customPlugin on
[14:10:08] <hightekvagabond> so, you are already testing to see if they exist by the nature of how you are calling it
[14:10:27] <xckpd7> oh ok so jQuery won't try to do anything
[14:10:34] <hightekvagabond> right

[14:29:29] <chrisx86> hi, how can i append an object to an html element using jquery? I have problems retrieving it using $(this).myObject in an event
[14:32:15] <ouzo13> Hello there.I have an html form with 3 <select>'s.First ones option values are same as the <select #id> of the next 2.How m i supposed to check if $(#id).val() == $(#id) ?
[14:36:55] <craigsnodgrass> Hello everybody
[14:37:12] <craigsnodgrass> Got a jquery mobile question
[14:37:34] <craigsnodgrass> about dynamic pages/links
[14:38:09] <craigsnodgrass> Any takers?
[14:40:55] <craigsnodgrass> Here's my JS: http://jsfiddle.net/eXqhw/
[14:41:31] <bl4ckcomb> is there a jQuery built-in function that sort's a set of child elements via a custom comparison function?
[14:42:03] <craigsnodgrass> I need to dynamically link my JSON data in a list view to a details page
[14:43:41] <djQuery1> bl4ckcomb: nope but theres a plugin for that see ?jqsort
[14:43:42] <bot-t1> bl4ckcomb, C# Syntax Example — Orion Transfer - http://www.oriontransfer.co.nz/projects/jquery-syntax/examples/csharp
[14:43:58] <bl4ckcomb> djQuery1, ah great. thank you
[14:44:02] <djQuery1> bad bot
[14:44:46] <djQuery1> hmmm cant find it anymore
[14:44:55] <bl4ckcomb> djQuery1, http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jtop-simple-content-sorting <- this one?
[14:44:59] <craigsnodgrass> I have my JSON data in a listview no probs, it's linking to and create the "details page" that's killing me
[14:45:39] <aaronmcadam> are you using Backbone or something similar craigsnodgrass
[14:45:46] <aaronmcadam> cuz what u want is pretty easy to do with that
[14:46:31] <djQuery1> bl4ckcomb: nope it was actualy called jqsort if memory servers correctly
[14:47:18] <bl4ckcomb> djQuery1, the closest match I find is jSort: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jSort
[14:47:41] <djQuery1> oh well
[14:48:11] <bl4ckcomb> djQuery1, just add some fuzzy string matching to your memory query and you'll survive :]
[14:48:17] <djQuery1> that one looks decent
[14:48:31] <bl4ckcomb> thanks for the hint!
[14:55:18] <zulax> for writing games with javascript, what should i use?
[14:55:30] <zulax> plain javascript, jquery, or any other framework/plugin?
[14:55:41] <djQuery> zulax: yes
[14:55:53] <zulax> which is better/easier/preferred?
[14:56:06] <aaronmcadam> paper.js?
[14:56:24] <yedimind> zulax, http://impactjs.com/
[14:56:33] <djQuery> craftyjs.com as well
[14:56:35] <zulax> thanks
[14:56:39] <yedimind> http://craftyjs.com/ also decent
[14:56:40] <yedimind> yeah

[14:57:01] <brettfrable> hey guys
[14:57:04] <phz> I'll have to make a chart with live streaming data, just found this amazing lib http://smoothiecharts.org/ that uses html5 canvas but now I would like to know what do you guys recommend me to make the communication with, I thought of html5's websocket api or json but I dont know either of them yet so any advice is appreciated
[14:58:26] <djQuery> phz: jplot
[14:58:34] <yedimind> http://paperjs.org/examples/bouncing-balls/ well that sucks
[14:58:40] <yedimind> it totally slows down with 5,000 balls
[14:58:42] <yedimind> useless garbage
[14:58:43] <djQuery> sorry jqplot
[15:01:41] <phz> djQuery you mean abandon smoothiecharts and use jqplot? cos I found smoothiecharts indeed really smooth for my needs so I just want to figure out how to get the realtime data form the server
[15:02:41] <djQuery> phz: sorry didnt read all the Q, how many browsers suport sockets
[15:02:57] <abadr> For the purposes of offset(), does the element include its borders?
[15:03:40] <phz> djQuery Idk for sure but it seems they are disabled by default in ff and safari for security reasons
[15:11:43] <Jon47> abadr http://api.jquery.com/offset/ read the "Note:" in the description
[15:12:42] <abadr> Jon47: "on the body element"
[15:13:24] <Jon47> abadr just test it, christ
[15:13:50] <Jon47> it'd be easier and faster to make an example with a crazy border and just test it yourself than asking someone else here to do it for you
[15:14:36] <abadr> Hard to know that without asking ;)
[15:14:48] <Jon47> sorry, that was kind of mean, but you gotta learn to fish
[15:15:17] <abadr> fair enough
[15:18:51] <tmckeown> hey so I'm playing around with jsonp callbacks and I was wondering if they have to be in the global namespace in order to be called?
[15:21:17] <vade> Hi. First, thanks for jquery, its freaking awesome. I have a possibly stupid question - how can one "inline" run a jquery function on an arbitrary piece of html, without using the <script> tag in header? I am dynamically adding html to a div via jquery (simply appending html via the '#somediv".html("new tags"). So, inside of "new tags" I would like to call a jquery or javascript function. Can I just inline a script tag ? :X ?
[15:21:59] <aaronmcadam> vade why
[15:22:11] <vade> making net-art, it serves no useful purpose
[15:22:33] <vade> I am essentially making a story print itself out on screen, into a div
[15:22:35] <aaronmcadam> appended script tags aren't guaranteed to work
[15:22:46] <vade> I have a jqeury function that randomizes text in a span.
[15:22:56] <aaronmcadam> you're better of using a script tag with event delegation
[15:22:59] <vade> so, part of the story I am printing, needs to be randomizing
[15:23:05] <vade> oh, what is event delegation?
[15:23:11] <aaronmcadam> ?on @ vade
[15:23:12] <bot-t1> vade, The new jQuery 1.7+ way of handling events: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[15:23:14] <aaronmcadam> ?delegate @ vade
[15:23:14] <bot-t1> vade, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[15:23:29] <vade> ha, cool. nice bot
[15:23:58] <vade> ill check that out. thank you.
[15:25:12] <aaronmcadam> guys how would you replicate this form Live Query: Live Query also has the ability to fire a function (callback) when it matches a new element and another function (callback) for when an element is no longer matched
[15:27:31] <vade> aaronmcadam: one question, as a bit of a javascript newb. Is it possible to attach a piece of javascript to an HDML dom object, without using some of the standard functions (i.e., onClick() etc?) i.e., can I do <div class="textblock" javascript="$('.textblock').setupTransmissions();"> </div> or something similar to "inline" the code?
[15:27:51] <aaronmcadam> no
[15:27:54] <vade> (where setupTransmissions is my own query function)
[15:28:02] <aaronmcadam> HTML DOM is an oxymoron
[15:28:06] <vade> ah, ok. was looking for a shortcut. I did not think so but, did not hurt to ask
[15:28:16] <aaronmcadam> just do it the right way TM
[15:28:26] <aaronmcadam> it's not *that* hard
[15:28:30] <vade> sure, ill look into event delegates.
[15:28:44] <vade> never said it was, just have not touched web-dev in a long time
[15:28:47] <vade> ;)
[15:29:04] <vade> so I am re-familiarizing myself with the right, and wrong ways. Anyway. Thanks again.
[15:29:33] <aaronmcadam> yucky yucky yucky livequery is so hacky
[15:31:16] <nyk_> could anyone try why the jquery ui autocomplete there isnt working in IE and opera (works fine in firefox) http://nyktalgia.dyndns.org/feepsSymfony/web/app.php/   (it's the search field: test with the words red or cola)
[15:35:37] <aaronmcadam> dammit
[15:35:50] <aaronmcadam> trying to think of how to replicate that functionality without crazy dom polling
[15:36:11] <aaronmcadam> ah, pubsub to the rescue
[15:36:30] <aaronmcadam> of course
[15:36:46] <djQuery> nyk_: seeing nothing in the console or profiler.
[15:38:01] <nyk_> how can it be that it is working in chrome and firefox and NOT in ie and opera?
[15:38:03] <nyk_> :<
[15:39:45] <djQuery> nyk_: well seeing as I see nothing in the profiler or network it is never making the json request
[15:40:16] <aaronmcadam> haha
[15:40:24] <aaronmcadam> is he cache bursting?
[15:40:30] <aaronmcadam> is it a GET req?
[15:40:53] <nyk_> i deleted the cache of my web app now
[15:40:59] <aaronmcadam> no
[15:41:00] <aaronmcadam> not that
[15:41:05] <aaronmcadam> I'm talking about IE
[15:41:15] <aaronmcadam> it caches GET requests if the URL doesn't change
[15:41:19] <aaronmcadam> so u can pass cache : false
[15:41:25] <aaronmcadam> to append a timestamp
[15:42:31] <nyk_> hm, i dont understand... u describe how i can fix the fault?
[15:42:39] <djQuery> nyk_: have you tried just hard coding some ajax call in the load?
[15:43:34] <nyk_> no, im a beginner in javascript, i got this scipt from the web and changed some parameters to fix my elasticsearch
[15:43:52] <djQuery> not seeing any errors at all
[15:44:22] <nyk_> and if u open the app with firefox it works like a charm...
[15:47:28] <nyk_> what would u suggest for me to do now? ^^
[15:57:56] <nyk_> is there something wrong with the json or how i use the json? u can get it with http://nyktalgia.dyndns.org:9200/_search?q=name:red
[16:01:08] <Kentrel> I want to use a datepicker instead of a datefield, and want the datepicker to always be open, not just when you select the input field. Can I do that?
[16:03:30] <singingwolfboy> can you use event delegation with JSON objects, rather than DOM elements?
[16:06:50] <darcyclarke> singingwolfboy how would that work?
[16:08:20] <singingwolfboy> if you use $(obj).trigger() to trigger an event on an object, any other objects that have that object as an immediate child would find out about it
[16:08:35] <singingwolfboy> eventually going up to the window object
[16:09:00] <darcyclarke> o_O
[16:09:07] <Hopsy> coldhead: I want to talk with you about this illumination crap
[16:09:16] <singingwolfboy> I'm guessing jquery doesn't support it, then? :)
[16:09:30] <aaronmcadam> um
[16:09:34] <aaronmcadam> ur misunderstanding
[16:09:35] <Hopsy> Does jquery has illumination?
[16:09:52] <coldhead> i don't know what you mean, Hopsy
[16:10:03] <coldhead> when i think of illumination i think of monks working in the middle ages
[16:10:05] <aaronmcadam> events make sense for DOM nodes only, how would it make sense for JSON
[16:10:08] <coldhead> the book of kells and all that
[16:10:18] <aaronmcadam> Hopsy do u mean that firebug plugin
[16:10:25] <singingwolfboy> aaronmcadam: not at all
[16:10:30] <coldhead> over to you, mcadam
[16:10:35] <tbranyen> Hopsy: i missed u
[16:10:36] <singingwolfboy> you can use an evented architecture for many things
[16:10:40] <aaronmcadam> fireQuery does the same job
[16:10:52] <aaronmcadam> singingwolfboy: I'm talking about the js spec
[16:10:54] <singingwolfboy> browsers fire events on DOM nodes based on the user's interaction with them
[16:11:00] <aaronmcadam> right
[16:11:05] <aaronmcadam> so where does json fit in there
[16:11:13] <Hopsy> coldhead: I just found a website: www.itanimulli.com that redirects to nsa.gov
[16:11:15] <aaronmcadam> you don't interact with json
[16:11:25] <Hopsy> conversely of illuminati
[16:11:27] <singingwolfboy> javascripts do
[16:11:27] <aaronmcadam> you can use pubsub for arbitrary stuff tho
[16:11:38] <aaronmcadam> singingwolfboy: https://gist.github.com/1321768
[16:12:04] <aaronmcadam> observer or publish/subscribe pattern singingwolfboy
[16:12:17] <singingwolfboy> aaronmcadam: that might be what I'm looking for
[16:12:20] <singingwolfboy> I'll read over that blog post
[16:12:22] <singingwolfboy> thanks!
[16:12:22] <aaronmcadam> probably is
[16:12:28] <aaronmcadam> it's only a gist covering some stuff
[16:12:43] <Hopsy> tbranyen: hi
[16:12:46] <aaronmcadam> i use this tiny plugin: https://github.com/phiggins42/bloody-jquery-plugins/blob/master/pubsub.js
[16:13:01] <aaronmcadam> that way your topics have nothing to do with the DOM
[16:13:16] <aaronmcadam> i.e. not like jq custom events
[16:14:15] <coldhead> so Hopsy, you're asking if jQuery is part of the illuminati conspiracy?
[16:14:31] <Hopsy> absolutly
[16:14:34] <Hopsy> yes
[16:15:08] <Hopsy> So much thinks has to do with it
[16:15:13] <coldhead> i'm sure it's part of their great inscrutable plan
[16:15:30] <coldhead> i saw a couple of white butterflies yesterday looking VERY nonchalant
[16:15:34] <coldhead> WAY TOO NONCHALANT
[16:15:51] <coldhead> i think they're up to something
[16:15:58] <rexchung> nasty style question: data- attributes without an rvalue (eg data-async instead of data-async="true") - good idea?
[16:16:26] <rexchung> elem.data('async') returns the empty string, which == false
[16:16:32] <aaronmcadam> nyk_: u using mongo?
[16:16:36] <rexchung> but the presence of the key should mean that it's true
[16:16:39] <Hopsy> lol coldhead
[16:17:03] <aaronmcadam> rexchung: an empty string is falsy
[16:17:20] <rexchung> is there a standard solution, like always say either "true" or "false" ?
[16:18:03] <aaronmcadam> huh?
[16:18:23] <aaronmcadam> like if the attr exists at all?
[16:18:26] <rexchung> yes
[16:18:34] <aaronmcadam> that doesn't make sense, what's wrong with passing true
[16:18:48] <rexchung> the latest version of haml, if you do :data => {:foo => true}
[16:18:56] <rexchung> will just insert the naked attr, with no rval
[16:19:03] <aaronmcadam> ok
[16:19:06] <rexchung> it seems silly to always cast the rval as a string
[16:19:12] <rexchung> but then we always have to check on the client side
[16:19:18] <rexchung> i was wondering if there was a nice workaround
[16:19:48] <aaronmcadam> ok
[16:19:56] <rexchung> if you set :data => {:foo => true} then the output html just has data-foo and checking if($.data('foo')) will return false
[16:20:04] <aaronmcadam> I see your point but it's not really a big issue
[16:20:56] <aaronmcadam> $('div[data-async]') should work
[16:20:58] <aaronmcadam> but still
[16:21:13] <aaronmcadam> attr selectors will be a bit inefficient
[16:21:38] <rexchung> but then $.data('async', false) would falsly return true
[16:21:55] <aaronmcadam> are you trying to set ajaxOptions with this?
[16:22:08] <rexchung> we're doing a manual if/else in a click handler
[16:22:25] <aaronmcadam> go on
[16:22:53] <aaronmcadam> what are you doing in this if/else
[16:23:15] <rexchung> we do it in a lot of places that's just this one example
[16:23:23] <aaronmcadam> do what exactly?
[16:23:24] <rexchung> i.e. refer to boolean data attrs
[16:23:36] <aaronmcadam> jesus
[16:23:41] <aaronmcadam> you're using strings to set booleans?
[16:23:46] <rexchung> what?
[16:23:48] <rexchung> no, we're not
[16:23:49] <aaronmcadam> you do know that's silly right
[16:23:51] <rexchung> that's exactly the problem
[16:23:55] <aaronmcadam> ?eval "false" == "true"
[16:23:56] <bot-t1> aaronmcadam: false
[16:24:14] <rexchung> what?
[16:24:19] <aaronmcadam> right
[16:24:21] <rexchung> i've lost context
[16:24:25] <rexchung> can you please explain
[16:24:35] <aaronmcadam> ?eval "false" == true
[16:24:35] <bot-t1> aaronmcadam: false
[16:24:50] <aaronmcadam> ?eval true == 1
[16:24:51] <bot-t1> aaronmcadam: true
[16:24:54] <rexchung> imagine you are speaking to a six year old
[16:24:55] <aaronmcadam> ?eval true == 'true'
[16:24:56] <bot-t1> aaronmcadam: false
[16:25:07] <aaronmcadam> ?eval '' == false
[16:25:08] <bot-t1> aaronmcadam: true
[16:25:20] <rexchung> i know all this
[16:25:22] <rexchung> what are you saying
[16:25:24] <rexchung> i don't understand
[16:25:30] <aaronmcadam> I'm just working something out
[16:25:50] <rexchung> ok
[16:25:52] <aaronmcadam> the issue is you're using strings for booleans which is just asking for trouble
[16:26:05] <rexchung> when you say "using strings for booleans"
[16:26:09] <aaronmcadam> unless you boolean coerce it which is probably gonna be unreadable
[16:26:26] <aaronmcadam> if you're saying data-attr="true" data-attr="false"
[16:26:26] <rexchung> do you mean that we're doing something like <a href="..." data-async="true"> ?
[16:26:30] <rexchung> no
[16:26:35] <rexchung> that is the opposite of what we're doing
[16:26:50] <aaronmcadam> what *are* you doing then?
[16:26:50] <rexchung> what we are now doing is <a href="..." data-async> ?
[16:26:58] <rexchung> s/?//
[16:27:02] <aaronmcadam> you're using html5?
[16:27:06] <rexchung> afaik
[16:27:30] <aaronmcadam> jsfiddle it
[16:28:05] <aaronmcadam> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.hasData/
[16:29:22] <rexchung> that test whether there are any data- attrs
[16:29:28] <aaronmcadam> yehyeh
[16:29:32] <rexchung> not, i believe, for the presence or absence of a specific such attribute
[16:29:45] <aaronmcadam> looking for context
[16:30:45] <rexchung> why is using data-foo="true" asking for trouble?
[16:30:59] <rexchung> cause then if(elem.data('foo')) will be true
[16:31:04] <rexchung> even if the predicate is set to "false" ?
[16:31:09] <aaronmcadam> yes
[16:31:14] <rexchung> i think this is just a shitty problem with no good solution
[16:31:19] <aaronmcadam> any non empty string is true
[16:31:27] <rexchung> but an empty string is false
[16:31:36] <rexchung> which is just as "incorrect"
[16:32:29] <rexchung> i think the right solution is to force everyone to manually always test for == "true" or == "false"
[16:32:35] <rexchung> and yell at my coworkers if they forget until they learn
[16:33:09] <aaronmcadam> that's really bad tho
[16:33:16] <aaronmcadam> I've seen the folly of that myself
[16:33:26] <aaronmcadam> testing for string booleans is confusing
[16:34:04] <rexchung> i guess i could write our own util methods
[16:34:09] <aaronmcadam> also there is a gotcha
[16:34:11] <rexchung> ?
[16:34:15] <PPaul> when i use $.ajax i'm passing in a data object data:{rev:234234}}. and it's not being appended to my url (i'm sending a DELETE request)
[16:34:22] <aaronmcadam> you can't return data if it hasn't already been set by $.fn.data
[16:34:34] <aaronmcadam> Regarding HTML5 data-* attributes: This low-level method does NOT retrieve the data-* attributes unless the more convenient .data() method has already retrieved them.
[16:34:46] <aaronmcadam> right
[16:36:28] <PPaul> i see that the .ajax function processed my data object, but it's not appending it to the url
[16:36:34] <aaronmcadam> rexchung: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/XMTBq/
[16:36:43] <aaronmcadam> ?ajax101 @ PPaul

[16:37:09] <hackeron> anyone? - I have a resizable object that I would like to resize programatically - how do I do it? -- If I do $("#myid").css('width','whatever') - it doesn't keep the aspect ratio and the bottom right resize helper doesn't move as you'd expect.
[16:37:16] <aaronmcadam> right that's having it added all the time one min
[16:37:29] <PPaul> i know that aaronmcadam...
[16:37:40] <PPaul> i'm using backbone and i'm extending it to work with couchdb
[16:37:52] <Ox41> Is there a length-agnostic inArray function
[16:37:53] <Ox41> ?
[16:38:06] <aaronmcadam> PPaul: look up japhr
[16:38:14] <aaronmcadam> his blog uses bbone with couch
[16:38:19] <PPaul> ok
[16:38:19] <aaronmcadam> japhr.blogspot
[16:38:29] <PPaul> thanks
[16:39:02] <aaronmcadam> and backbone recipes are good
[16:39:08] <aaronmcadam> for advanced bbone stuff
[16:39:25] <Ox41> "1234555" in [9,65,43,12] would return true? because it matched 12
[16:40:08] <aaronmcadam> using $.inArray?
[16:40:30] <nyk_> is it possible, that IE and opera wont work with my script because of source: .....; $.ajax({ url: "nyktalgia.dyndns.org:9200/_search",   <--- the port 9200??
[16:40:30] <Ox41> well, whatever would work
[16:41:08] <aaronmcadam> nyk_: is the script even sending an xhr?
[16:41:09] <Ox41> Im checking the prefix on creditcard numbers...
[16:41:14] <aaronmcadam> nyk_: use firebug to make sure
[16:41:21] <aaronmcadam> ah right
[16:43:20] <aaronmcadam> 0x41 you'd want to unit test this but try here: http://weblog.bocoup.com/javascript-credit-card-validation
[16:43:54] <Ox41> aaronmcadam: yeah, my function is wayy more complex lol
[16:44:05] <Ox41> http://jsfiddle.net/LhMA8/
[16:44:06] <aaronmcadam> it uses the % 10 trick

[17:12:10] <ragas> hmm running it from the console works; must be the document.ready shortcut failing.

[17:15:43] <hackeron> question, I'm trying to use draggable with helper: 'clone' - but it seems to be working a bit unexpectedly - I get a cloned element that's much bigger than what it's cloning from :/ - try it here: http://monitor.xanview.com:3000/live -- any ideas?

[17:19:40] <JuanCri> hackeron, I tried the URL? are you talking about the "Long camera?" elements?
[17:19:47] <JuanCri> they seem to work fine for me (Chrome)
[17:20:04] <hackeron> JuanCri: yeh, I changed it from clone to just revert since that's what I want to do anyway :P
[17:21:32] <JuanCri> OK? anyway I think you should move the item to the top (using z-index or something like that)

[19:34:37] <DrPoole> I need some direction.  I have a page where users set various documents to be converted to pdf.  This takes some time.  So when they select the documents they want, I'm sending each request to the server that puts it into the queue for conversion and marks each <tr> they selected with "Generating" and a loading icon.
[19:34:58] <DrPoole> I need a (proper) way of checking if each <tr> is finished yet.  I have an id and a script I can use to get a yes/no answer from
[19:35:45] <DrPoole> my current method is .... shit.  it's hammering my server checking for progress every second because I can't seem to comprehend how to get javascript to sleep (setInterval).
[19:38:30] <coldhead> can anyone please kill me
[19:38:44] <ChrisPartridge> what do i get out of it?

[19:44:07] <Whirl3d> Good evening all, what is the current preferred method for jquery to create, edit, access cookies?
[19:51:03] <Whirl3d> quiet channel tonight, huh?
[19:51:52] <hackeron> I have a resizable object that I would like to resize programatically - how do I do it? -- If I do $("#myid").css('width','whatever') - it doesn't keep the aspect ratio and the bottom right resize helper doesn't move as you'd expect.
[19:52:38] <Whirl3d> have you tried .width()?
[19:52:59] <Whirl3d> $("#myid").width(newWidth).height(newHeight)
[19:56:25] <hackeron> Whirl3d: that kind of does it but it does not trigger the resize event
[19:56:52] <Whirl3d> are you using jquery UI's resizable object?
[19:57:15] <iSaleK> I have the next code <a href='#'><span class='one'>Text</span><span class='two'>Text2</span></a> and $('#hotSpots a').live('click', function(e)  {}); function.
[19:57:26] <hackeron> Whirl3d: yes
[19:57:35] <iSaleK> How can I get the value of the A > .two ?
[19:57:53] <Whirl3d> iSalek, please post your code to jsfiddle.net it makes it much easier to read
[19:58:55] <Whirl3d> hackeron, I'm not well-versed in jQueryUI, I'm afraid. But it stands to reason that you could manually trigger the resize event using $("#myid").trigger("resize.ui") or something similar.
[20:00:00] <iSaleK> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/fnrxZ/
[20:00:21] <iSaleK> How can I get the text of the span that has class name in this function?
[20:01:37] <hackeron> Whirl3d: that works, thank you! :)
[20:01:48] <hackeron> Whirl3d: well, I'm triggering like this: $("#live_layout").trigger("resizestop")
[20:01:59] <iSaleK> Whirl3d: I guess I can try .children("span.name") ?
[20:02:06] <Whirl3d> iSalek, I am not sure what you are asking
[20:02:33] <hackeron> Whirl3d: one more quesion, is there anyway to get the maximum usable width for a div? (to use to resize to that)
[20:02:39] <iSaleK> Whirl3d: I got it to work with .children("span.name"). Thx anyway :)
[20:02:45] <Whirl3d> np
[20:02:47] <hackeron> Whirl3d: or rather care more about height
[20:03:38] <Whirl3d> That's gonna be in your UI API docs, really. I wish I knew, but I am assuming that it somehow stores the max and min for the object in a property, attribute, or in a data object
[20:04:25] <hackeron> Whirl3d: I mean just generally - say I have a div - anyway to check how tall I can make it with jquery?
[20:04:42] <Whirl3d> before what?
[20:04:48] <Whirl3d> Before it goes off the screen?
[20:04:52] <hackeron> Whirl3d: I know there's window size, but that will ignore my menu
[20:05:18] <hackeron> Whirl3d: before the browser needs to scroll - i.e. width: 100% -- what width that would be in pixels
[20:05:37] <Whirl3d> $("window").width()
[20:06:24] <Whirl3d> That kind of depends on how you have things setup.
[20:07:06] <hackeron> Whirl3d: ah, I think I'm looking for $("#content").height() in my case
[20:07:24] <Whirl3d> If #content is your content holder, probably.
[20:07:28] <ChrisPartridge> Try .outerHeight() if height() isn't what you're after.
[20:07:49] <Whirl3d> ?.outerHeight
[20:07:49] <bot-t1> .outerHeight([includeMargin]): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding, border, and optionally margin. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[20:07:55] <Whirl3d> ?.height
[20:07:55] <bot-t1> .height(): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/height/
[20:10:32] <hackeron> Whirl3d: hmm, probably outerHeight - height just seems to return 500px no matter what size it is :/
[20:10:52] <hackeron> Whirl3d: no wait, outerHeight just returns 520 :/
[20:11:21] <Whirl3d> ?.prop
[20:11:21] <bot-t1> .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[20:11:33] <Whirl3d> ?.attr
[20:11:34] <bot-t1> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[20:12:16] <Whirl3d> I hate to admit it, but I still don't get the difference between attributes and properties specifically when you add css to the mix...
[20:14:07] <hackeron> Whirl3d: hmm, not sure what to do with prop or attr? -- it seems the container size is fixed by my resizable object
[20:14:20] <hackeron> Whirl3d: so I can't seem to get the "available space left on screen" so to speak :/
[20:14:56] <ChrisPartridge> hackeron: I did that exact thing with jQuery on the weekend just past, it's possible.
[20:17:18] <Whirl3d> hackeron, when you instantiate your resizable object, are you defining a maxHeight, maxWidth, or containment object?
[20:18:52] <hackeron> Whirl3d: I guess this works, hmm < myheight = $(document).height()-$("nav").outerHeight()-25
[20:19:07] <hackeron> Whirl3d: nope
[20:20:35] <Whirl3d> Maybe you should have a container that has predefined height and width and use that as your containment option when you setup your resizable.
[20:22:25] <hackeron> Whirl3d: oh, I do, it's set to 640x480 by default, but I want to stretch it based on the available height while following the 4:3 aspect ratio
[20:22:41] <Whirl3d> Are you trying to manage window resizing?
[20:22:58] <Whirl3d> Because you don't need the resizable object to handle thre window.resize event.
[20:23:17] <hackeron> no, just want the live layout to take up the whole page by default - if a user than resizes their window, that's their problem, heh - this is the page < http://monitor.xanview.com:3000/live
[20:23:28] <hackeron> I kinda have it doing what I want
[20:24:25] <Whirl3d> So can the user resize those windows?
[20:24:46] <hackeron> Whirl3d: the layout? - yeh
[20:24:57] <Whirl3d> *windows, i mean, longCameraName 2
[20:25:06] <hackeron> Whirl3d: and that will request different size images from the cctv server
[20:26:22] <Whirl3d> Seems like the kind of thing a table would be ideal for
[20:26:30] <ChrisPartridge> hackeron: see here: http://pastebin.com/HDSLJ90Q
[20:27:07] <Whirl3d> ChrisPartridge, I think he is talking about the multiple panels within the window.
[20:27:42] <Whirl3d> He's not just handling the resize of the viewport, but rather the resize of multiple smaller panels that he wants to take up the entire viewport
[20:28:08] <Whirl3d> but maybe I am wrong.
[20:28:09] <hackeron> Whirl3d: I think it's working as I want now - check it out
[20:28:20] <ChrisPartridge> Whirl3d: if that's the case, then my code handles that.
[20:28:30] <ChrisPartridge> it even handles fluid toolbars, inside the main containment div
[20:28:41] <ChrisPartridge> which my users can add additional buttons/items too
[20:28:51] <hackeron> ChrisPartridge: having a look
[20:28:54] <Whirl3d> hackeron, I cant resize your elements, I can move them (ghosted)
[20:29:07] <ChrisPartridge> handles resize on all browsers i've tested with + iphone/ipad
[20:29:15] <hackeron> Whirl3d: you don't see the resize thing at the bottom right corner of the layout?
[20:30:34] <Whirl3d> I thought you were asking to resize the individual elements within the main block. to create custom sized layouts like the icons to the left
[20:30:52] <hackeron> ChrisPartridge: I see, that's kind of similar to what I'm doing, except I'm doing it on load only because from testing, resizing live when tens of images are reloading in each box isn't the greatest idea
[20:31:08] <hackeron> ChrisPartridge: btw, here's a working version that I'm working on improving: http://uni.xanview.com - user/pass: demo/demo
[20:31:27] <ChrisPartridge> hackeron: we have html elements wiht TONNES of elements, resizing works fine for us
[20:31:54] <hackeron> Whirl3d: no the tables on the top left allow you to choose a layout, from thre I want to just allow resizing the layout and have it fill the page by default on load -- I think that's sufficient
[20:32:11] <hackeron> ChrisPartridge: are they all refreshing at 10fps each?
[20:32:54] <Whirl3d> hackeron, than why use resizable? just define the size on load
[20:33:08] <hackeron> ChrisPartridge: I saved your code though, will try it when there is a live feed in each box :) - just from past experience live resizing didn't really work well
[20:33:23] <GoSox> does javascript have elseif ?
[20:33:43] <GoSox> if ( ) { } elseif ( ) { } else { }
[20:33:49] <Whirl3d> else if
[20:33:55] <ChrisPartridge> space in between else and if
[20:34:02] <GoSox> ok
[20:34:03] <hackeron> Whirl3d: yeh, I was thinking maybe just remove resizable - may just do that - but some times it's nice to request smaller images over a slow connection -- guess the user could just resize the browser window - hmmm
[20:34:10] <GoSox> works the same otherwise though?
[20:34:12] <ChrisPartridge> hackeron: What part of this page is getting a height set?
[20:34:48] <Whirl3d> hackeron, perhaps you could have a "resize mode" where the user could resize the windows the way the want and then a "live" mode to return to the feed/
[20:35:13] <ChrisPartridge> or just pause updates to images while the resize happens (generally very quick)
[20:35:28] <coldhead> it's all very gomblicated isn't it
[20:35:53] <Whirl3d> coldhead! good evening...
[20:36:00] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky that I punched a dragon today
[20:36:06] <hackeron> ChrisPartridge: btw, when I try to use your code it says browser is not defined?
[20:36:15] <abjorn> bot-t1: tell imsky that I punched a dragon today
[20:36:15] <bot-t1> abjorn, Okay.
[20:36:22] <abjorn> ya fuk you bot-t1
[20:36:28] <ChrisPartridge> hackeron: browser is just $(window)
[20:36:49] <ChrisPartridge> hackeron: just noticed another issue in the code i pasted, 2 secs
[20:37:25] <hackeron> ChrisPartridge: yeh, see, bad things start to happen :( - try resizing the window here: http://monitor.xanview.com:3000/live
[20:38:11] <coldhead> hallo Whirl3d
[20:39:14] <ChrisPartridge> hackeron: resizing works fine for me there, but not seeing any images in the cameras
[20:39:26] <hackeron> ChrisPartridge: try firefox
[20:39:33] <hackeron> ChrisPartridge: yeh, there aren't any yet - it's a work in progress
[20:40:01] <hackeron> ChrisPartridge: it's just painfully, painfully slow in firefox :(
[20:40:58] <ChrisPartridge> Hm, work's ok in firefox - bit slower
[20:41:05] <ChrisPartridge> are you animating the resize transition?
[20:41:24] <hackeron> ChrisPartridge: nope :/
[20:41:46] <hackeron> ChrisPartridge: a bit? - it's painfully slow on my core i7 here :/
[20:45:01] <hackeron> is there anyway to call a limit on the number of times a function is called with $(window).resize?
[20:47:49] <hackeron> maybe setTimeout or something?
[20:48:20] <Whirl3d> Just setup a delay in your window.resize handler.
[20:48:41] <Whirl3d> then clear the setTimeout on resize
[20:49:12] <Whirl3d> so that way it freezes the images, allows the resize and waits for 3 seconds to be sure that the user is done, then restarts the feed
[20:49:41] <Whirl3d> if the user resizes again within the 3 seconds, the timer is cleared and restarted.

[21:01:39] <Whirl3d> hackeron, checking
[21:03:08] <_bogus_> hey there... do anyone knows a simple customizable carousel plugin that slides pictures horizontally (more than one in a 100% width container), with navigation ?
[21:03:45] <hackeron> Whirl3d: look at especially /assets/global.js and /assets/live.js
[21:03:55] <hackeron> Whirl3d: in global I have the waitForFinalEvent function
[21:04:00] <Whirl3d> thanx, I was just gonna ask...
[21:04:58] <hackeron> sorry about the lack of blank lines - coffee script is responsible for that :)
[21:10:54] <hackeron> Whirl3d: any ideas?
[21:11:16] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/DgDDx/1/
[21:11:28] <Whirl3d> Really rough, but that's what I was thinking.
[21:12:08] <hackeron> hmmm
[21:12:22] <hackeron> Whirl3d: I was looking at this, but can't get it to work :/ < http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2854407/javascript-jquery-window-resize-how-to-fire-after-the-resize-is-completed
[21:14:48] <hooloovoo> Whirl3d: cool, seems to be working. Thanks! =)
[21:16:07] <Whirl3d> np
[21:16:18] <Whirl3d> hackeron, here is the same thing for the window.resize event
[21:16:19] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/DgDDx/3/
[21:16:42] <hackeron> that seems like a lot of cuntions to do something pretty basic :/
[21:16:47] <RockMeAmadeus> Does jquery support the new html5 progress element?
[21:16:56] <Whirl3d> seriously?
[21:17:15] <Whirl3d> You can do it all inline, I was just calling it out to make is simple.
[21:17:16] <RockMeAmadeus> I'm trying to select a progress element and I can't tell if its my own ignorance or jquery thats doing it wrong
[21:17:46] <Whirl3d> it could probably be reduced to a couple of lines, but I figured for explanation purposes, calling it all out was easiest
[21:19:08] <hooloovoo> urrrgh! still won't work! =S
[21:19:17] <hooloovoo> but now i'm sending the right data at least
[21:20:36] <hackeron> Whirl3d: hmm, this looks promising, what do you think? < http://stackoverflow.com/questions/667426/javascript-resize-event-firing-multiple-times-while-dragging-the-resize-handle/668185#668185
[21:20:55] <nospinzy> im trying to hide a parent div from clicking on another div inside http://jsfiddle.net/V6JpZ/
[21:21:01] <nospinzy> but im having problems with it
[21:21:13] <Whirl3d> hackeron, try this: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/DgDDx/4/
[21:22:13] <hackeron> Whirl3d: yeh, that's pretty much what they do in that example more or less :)
[21:22:36] <Whirl3d> Yeah, the first fiddle handled the manual resize without window resizing as well.
[21:22:38] <hackeron> Whirl3d: ok, it's 5:30am, I'm going to head to bed -- thanks so much for all your help - it's really coming along! :)
[21:22:47] <Whirl3d> Looks great.
[21:22:54] <Whirl3d> gnite
[21:23:04] <hackeron> I'll be back tomorrow for help no doubt, heh
[21:24:39] <Whirl3d> nospinzy, try setting your fiddle to use jquery instead of mootools
[21:24:58] <nospinzy> nm i got it
[21:36:17] <GoSox> so when I submit this form and there are no $error_code 's from the server side .php, I get an alert 6 (as I should) but I don't ever get an alert 7. Is there something wrong with my code?
[21:36:18] <GoSox> http://pastebin.com/cNMkm8u3
[21:40:29] <GoSox> hmm it seems to be the .play(), but I'm confused because I've been using .play() all over my site, and it has never stopped my scripts from working in IE before, it simply wouldn't play any audio in IE
[21:55:38] <jhgaylor> Can someone point me to some documentation for accessing nested elements please?
[21:56:44] <Eviltwin> ?
[21:57:11] <Eviltwin> ?selector
[21:57:12] <bot-t> Eviltwin, Selectors - Each action we perform with jQuery requires a target; for example, in order to hide or show an element on the page, first we must find that element. To do so, we rely on jQuerys selector expression... http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[21:58:02] <jhgaylor> do I have to access elements that jQuery created differently than hard coded elements?
[21:58:28] <jhgaylor> select*  not access
[21:59:03] <Eviltwin> Are the elements part o the DOM?
[21:59:18] <Eviltwin> of*
[21:59:52] <Eviltwin> Can you make a pastebin example of what's not working?
[21:59:59] <jhgaylor> sure can.
[22:00:03] <Eviltwin> An example
[22:00:05] <jhgaylor> let me clean it up right quick
[22:00:37] <Eviltwin> Just the part that's not working how you expect
[22:00:40] <Eviltwin> I don't want to see pages
[22:01:02] <jhgaylor> nah, like 15 lines
[22:01:24] <Eviltwin> That's fine
[22:02:33] <jhgaylor> http://pastebin.com/mVhYEx4m
[22:02:46] <abjorn> (12:01:43 AM) zalzane: hetergenous procedural algorithms are a whole nother bowl of ramen
[22:02:49] <abjorn> i liek irc
[22:03:49] <Eviltwin> jhgaylor: So what's the problem?
[22:04:04] <jhgaylor> if i cahnged the first like to $('.array') it will append to the element with class 'array'.  but it won't append to the tweet class elements
[22:04:10] <jhgaylor> first line*
[22:05:53] <ngharo> are you fetching tweets via api?
[22:05:59] <jhgaylor> indeed
[22:06:08] <ngharo> run your code in the callback
[22:06:19] <ngharo> .tweets probably doesnt exist when that code executes
[22:06:36] <jhgaylor> i'm new to the twitter api... im used to working with the JSON feed via gnip, but not directly with twitter
[22:06:45] <jhgaylor> i'm also used to doing it in php and perl
[22:06:55] <Welldone> k
[22:06:57] <jhgaylor> what is the callback>?
[22:07:37] <ngharo> are you using $.getJSON for fetching the data?
[22:07:58] <jhgaylor> yes
[22:08:03] <jhgaylor> and going through it with .each
[22:08:23] <ngharo> ?getjson
[22:08:24] <bot-t> jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[22:09:10] <ngharo> success is the function that will execute when the response returns ok
[22:09:23] <ngharo> better known as the callback
[22:09:44] <jhgaylor> oh okay.  i understand.  i am doing that
[22:12:48] <jhgaylor> I generate a string something like '<div class="tweet">data</div>'.  I then append that to some other div element. Is there anything else I have to do to make that element behave the same as a hard coded one?
[22:13:08] <Eviltwin> What do you mean by that?
[22:14:09] <jhgaylor> i just tested adding <div class="tweet"></div> into my html file before execution.  that element is modified by my code as expected.  however, the ones I created with my jQuery function are not modified
[22:14:42] <ngharo> as I said, those elements don't exist when your code is ran
[22:14:48] <ngharo> hense do your work in the getjson callback
[22:15:31] <Eviltwin> If you try to act on the element before it exists, it won't work
[22:15:41] <jhgaylor> ngharo: I am actually.  he asked for a very specific 'what isn't working correctly'.  I took that part out
[22:17:08] <ngharo> can you paste more code
[22:17:16] <jhgaylor> Yeah, I am working it up now
[22:17:53] <jhgaylor> http://pastebin.com/XkDtY3vN
[22:19:51] <jhgaylor> I think i left some stuff commented out by accident, but that isn't my problem.  that was just a risidual comment
[22:24:04] <jhgaylor> http://pastebin.com/PSZQC4Fs is a much cleaner paste of the same thing
[22:27:33] <Eviltwin> Okay, the problem is this
[22:27:48] <Eviltwin> fetch_tweets will return before it has actually fetched anything
[22:28:17] <Eviltwin> Which means $(".tweet") will start running before any ata has been fetched and any of the divs for tweets have been created
[22:28:37] <jhgaylor> okay.  Why will it return before it is done?
[22:28:39] <Eviltwin> I suggest you move that each to insie of the getJSON callback in fetch_tweets
[22:28:48] <Eviltwin> That's just how asynchronous programming works
[22:29:19] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/uYeYN/
[22:29:33] <jhgaylor> ngharo, im sorry i doubted you.
[22:29:41] <jhgaylor> eviltwin, thanks for the explanation
[22:32:23] <jhgaylor> Though, I'm still rather confused.  I'm going to explore that link, and I'll come back
[22:32:44] <Eviltwin> Have you worked with threads before?
[22:32:59] <Eviltwin> Like in C or Java or Python or something
[22:32:59] <sorrymyeng> hi everybody, im using $('#label-email').html("enter email"); alert($('#label-email').html()); and alerted "enter email" but the changes do not showing on the page
[22:33:15] <jhgaylor> Once.  Ever.  In perl.   I've never had to deal with semifors or anything of that nature
[22:33:31] <Eviltwin> jhgaylor: JavaScript simplifies the problem by only allowing you one thread
[22:33:38] <Eviltwin> And making things event-driven
[22:33:42] <jhgaylor> I don't have a formal programming education (working on it) just years of self taught php/perl
[22:34:18] <Eviltwin> As a result, only one piece of code is running at a time
[22:34:45] <Eviltwin> In this case, rather than waste time waiting for your data, the rest of your code runs and eventually you get to the callback
[22:34:59] <Eviltwin> sorrymyeng: You probably have more than one element with ID "label-email"
[22:36:01] <sorrymyeng> Eviltwin: hmm you right, how can i access the second?
[22:36:08] <Eviltwin> You can't
[22:36:11] <Eviltwin> You're only allowed one
[22:36:14] <Eviltwin> You broke the rules
[22:36:18] <jhgaylor> use class?
[22:36:30] <sorrymyeng> jhgaylor: right!
[22:37:41] <ngharo> :]
[22:38:03] <sorrymyeng> jhgaylor: how to access the second element that has the same class?..
[22:38:41] <jhgaylor> I think that if you made your selector $('.classname') and your html was right, it would just work
[22:38:53] <jhgaylor> but I am a total jQuery scrub
[22:39:38] <sorrymyeng> jhgaylor: $('.label-email:eq(1)').html("enter email"); works for me
[22:39:59] <sorrymyeng> thank you guys!
[22:40:06] <jhgaylor> eviltwin: I'm still not following.  I just don't understand what/when the callbacks execute and return. was your suggestion that my code should be http://pastebin.com/HRbm2S9N ?
[22:40:28] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[22:40:30] <Eviltwin> At least generally
[22:40:49] <jhgaylor> I won't have a problem with having two queries to twitter simultaneously?
[22:40:53] <Eviltwin> That's the idea even if it's not exact
[22:41:01] <jhgaylor> sweet. i helped someone :D
[22:42:21] <jhgaylor> You were saying something about threads.  I have a basic idea of what is going on with threads. I understand that the parent is a pointer to the child, and the child points to 0.  That both run simultaneously.
[22:43:03] <jhgaylor> does the callback act like a fork and continue executing the page?
[22:43:06] <Eviltwin> Okay, I brought up threads because it's an important idea to understand for most asynchronous stuff
[22:43:11] <jhgaylor> oh okay
[22:43:13] <Eviltwin> However they bring up lots of problems
[22:43:22] <Eviltwin> As a result JavaScript has no threads
[22:43:26] <jhgaylor> oh.
[22:43:40] <Eviltwin> Only one thing is running ever
[22:43:48] <Eviltwin> At least within JavScript
[22:44:14] <jhgaylor> so with a line like $(json.results).each(function(){......}
[22:44:14] <Eviltwin> For example when you do $.getJSON or similar, the actual fetching work takes place in the background
[22:44:22] <Eviltwin> That's actually different
[22:44:32] <Eviltwin> That still executes in the order you'd expect
[22:44:39] <Eviltwin> Here: http://jsfiddle.net/uYeYN/1/
[22:44:44] <Eviltwin> I put in labels
[22:44:47] <Eviltwin> A-R
[22:44:51] <Eviltwin> Of the order things execute in
[22:45:27] <Eviltwin> The setTimeout there is what causes the execution to be delayed
[22:53:16] <jhgaylor> http://pastebin.com/HRbm2S9N vs http://pastebin.com/9fVxR40x
[22:53:23] <jhgaylor> which is right and why?
[22:53:43] <jhgaylor> i think its the 2nd, but that sjut because I feel the first is wrong
[22:53:47] <jhgaylor> so both could be utter failures
[22:54:39] <Eviltwin> The first will make one request for every result
[22:54:50] <Eviltwin> The sceond will make one request for the whole result
[22:55:00] <Eviltwin> .each runs synchronously
[22:55:41] <ngharo> jhgaylor: i think you can get away without that extra loop
[22:55:43] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/uYeYN/2/
[22:57:30] <jhgaylor> ngharo: sidenote, your syntax is so much different than mine.  Is mine wrong?
[22:58:01] <ngharo> not really there are just different ways to do things
[22:58:20] <ngharo> you can create elements using what looks like a selector: $('<div />')
[22:58:46] <ngharo> and then the second arg is attributes
[22:59:00] <Eviltwin> You don't need the space in there and technically don't need the slash either
[22:59:16] <Eviltwin> Although some people will shoot you if you do
[22:59:32] <ngharo> bang!
[23:02:53] <jhgaylor> ngharo: if I were to test the type on $tweet, what would it be?
[23:02:57] <jhgaylor> object?
[23:03:25] <Eviltwin> It's a jQuery object
[23:03:42] <jhgaylor> on which I could legally call .append() right?
[23:03:47] <Eviltwin> Yup
[23:03:58] <jhgaylor> jquery is a whole new world.
[23:04:04] <Eviltwin> Magical world
[23:05:06] <jhgaylor> is that notation more common?  i used a string, and I expect that that is discouraged
[23:05:53] <Eviltwin> it entirely depends on what you want to do
[23:06:46] <Eviltwin> For example $("<div/>").html("<div></div>");
[23:06:58] <Eviltwin> Will produce the same thing as $("<div><div></div></div>");
[23:07:13] <ngharo> if you're going to select it later, you may as well build it with jquery to begin with to prevent that
[23:07:20] <ngharo> imo
[23:07:30] <Eviltwin> Whereas $("<div/>").text("<div></div>") will produce the same thing as $("<div>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</div>")
[23:07:48] <jhgaylor> that makes sense.
[23:08:01] <Eviltwin> Since you've worked in PHP
[23:08:06] <Eviltwin> You probably know about escaping strings
[23:08:07] <Eviltwin> Right?
[23:08:13] <jhgaylor> yeah... lol
[23:08:23] <Eviltwin> In the world of JavaScript and jQuery, you rarely if ever have to think about that
[23:09:02] <Eviltwin> Because of you can do things like .text()
[23:09:08] <Eviltwin> Or .attr()
[23:09:09] <Eviltwin> Etc
[23:09:21] <Eviltwin> Instead of trying to write HTML
[23:09:44] <ngharo> regarding attr, instead of using attributes to store data you should use data attributes.  see ?data
[23:09:44] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[23:09:57] <Eviltwin> I'm not talking about using .attr to store data
[23:10:07] <Eviltwin> I'm talking about using .attr for attributes
[23:10:10] <ngharo> oh, i know.  just talking about his paste
[23:10:23] <Eviltwin> Anyway, I gotta go
[23:10:28] <Eviltwin> TTYL
[23:10:30] <ngharo> same here, off to bed
[23:10:34] <ngharo> good luck jhgaylor
[23:10:34] <jhgaylor> yeah... .data() is what I was looking for before
[23:10:40] <jhgaylor> thanks for the help both of you
[23:11:12] <ngharo> <div data-name="ngharo"> can be accessed via .data('name')
[23:11:18] <ngharo> just like attr
[23:11:21] <ngharo> peace
[23:32:39] <jhgaylor> if .getJSON is only going to return one result, do I need to go through it with .each?
[23:35:08] <Cork> no
[23:35:23] <Cork> jhgaylor: it all depends on what structure you have on the data you return
[23:35:42] <Cork> each is only needed if you return an array, doens't matter how many elements are in it
[23:36:25] <jhgaylor> will it break it to use each on a result set with only one result?
[23:36:33] <Cork> no
[23:36:50] <Cork> as long as the returned data is an array
[23:36:55] <jhgaylor> cool.  I'm just trying to eliminate lines as the problem line
[23:36:58] <Cork> if its not they, yes it will
[23:37:11] <Cork> *not, then yes
[23:37:45] <Cork> jhgaylor: if the outer most element in the json is [] each or [0] will work if you have one elemenr
[23:37:50] <Cork> *element
[23:38:00] <Cork> if its an obect {} then each will break
[23:38:33] <jhgaylor> it is the latter.  What is the proper way to work with that result?
[23:38:49] <Cork> just access it from the data variable
[23:38:55] <Cork> ex. data.key_name
[23:39:37] <jhgaylor> so, if my code is $.getJSON(url,function(json){, then i can just work with it by 		$(json.results).key_name?
[23:40:13] <Cork> no need for the $()
[23:40:36] <Cork> $() is to render it as a dom object
[23:40:55] <jhgaylor> oh.
[23:41:00] <jhgaylor> that makes sense.
[23:41:34] <Cork> and results is if you have a result key in your outer object in the json
[23:41:50] <Cork> else its just json.key_name
[23:42:19] <jhgaylor> Okay, so I would only use json.results if I were using .each, more or less?
[23:43:09] <Cork> no, if your json data looks like { "results": { "key_name": "some data" } }
[23:43:16] <Cork> you access it as json.results.key_name
[23:43:56] <Cork> the json variable is the "root" in the json object
[23:44:37] <jhgaylor> jquery is a beast.....
[23:44:59] <Cork> this has nothing to do with jquery actulally
[23:45:17] <Cork> its just json and basic javascript variables
[23:45:49] <jhgaylor> yeah.  I understand as much.  My statement is still true.  Just not sparked by my lack of understand of json
[23:47:20] <jhgaylor> But I do wish I had had a firmer understand of java and the DOM before attempting to undertake a project that required jquery
[23:47:24] <jhgaylor> javascript*
[23:48:06] <Cork> jhgaylor: well dom isn't that needed when you have jquery
[23:48:21] <Cork> but you DO need to know javascript, css and html
[23:48:27] <beasty_> morning
[23:48:38] <Cork> jquery mosty makes dom look like html
[23:48:47] <Cork> or "jquery objects"
[23:49:31] <Cork> but, ya i wouldn't want to start in jquery learning the basics always help diagnosing what breajs
[23:49:34] <Cork> *breaks
[23:52:04] <jhgaylor> in JS are " and ' interchangable as long as I do it in pairs?
[23:52:43] <Cork> yes
[23:52:47] <Cork> but not in json
[23:52:55] <Cork> json only supports "
[23:54:01] <jhgaylor> I have a fairly solid conceptual understanding of programming... I have no formal education but I have taught myself enough PHP to get a job and work my way through college programming.  I just learn what I have to as I go along to finish a project.
[23:54:04] <sandeep0291> hi, any example for showing a backgroung image until the actual image fully loads...or something like progress bar
[23:54:27] <Cork> jhgaylor: ya, same here
[23:54:45] <Cork> jhgaylor: except it wasn't college for me :)
[23:55:19] <Cork> sandeep0291: sett the image and listen for .load on the img tag
[23:56:48] <jhgaylor> I'm hoping I manage to finish college within a couple years and can claim a formal education and make real money.... we shall see.  As it is, I've spent almost 5 hours on this stinkin script that isn't complex enough to have stumped me... but yet it is
[23:56:49] <jhgaylor> and it has
[23:56:50] <sandeep0291> Cork: thx...
[23:59:03] <coldhead> we'll all be dead before the year is out
[23:59:15] <sandeep0291> Cork: as i m nt familiar that much with jquery..if u can give me example or link..it will be gr8  :)
[23:59:46] <Cork> sandeep0291: not sure there are any jquery examples
