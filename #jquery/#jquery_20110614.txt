[00:00:19] <Cork> Shoruken: by "update src attr" do you really mean load a new page in the iframe?
[00:00:28] <Cork> thats two different things
[00:00:35] <Shoruken> yeah, basically
[00:00:56] <Shoruken> it's running a php script, the script passes in a string to the iframe to be displayed on its results
[00:01:07] <Cork> you update src attribute > browser calls server > servers responds > browser parses content > browser renders content > load is called
[00:01:23] <Cork> so if you want to wait intill content is rendered use the load event
[00:01:34] <Cork> else just change the src and for get about it
[00:02:16] <Shoruken> is load called everytime this happens? and what would i bind it to, the iframe?
[00:03:11] <K1ng> http://jsfiddle.net/Uhzuc/
[00:03:19] <K1ng> any idea why $.ajax making 2 calls :(
[00:04:00] <K1ng> one with Post another one is without Post
[00:05:17] <Shoruken> i think i found a good example online based on whta you've told me Cork, thanks ;)

[01:23:32] <goshawk> hi
[01:24:03] <goshawk> i binded the click() event of a div, but when the cursor goes on top of the div it doesn't change like it's a link.. how can i do it ?
[01:24:40] <coldhead> it isn't a link
[01:24:51] <coldhead> you should make it a link and it will act like one
[01:24:52] <nail_> cursor: pointer
[01:25:04] <coldhead> or do it in css, yes :)
[01:25:11] <goshawk> how ?
[01:25:29] <goshawk> cursor:pointer in css
[01:25:29] <goshawk> ?
[01:25:40] <coldhead> div:hover {cursor:pointer;text-decoration:underline}
[01:25:51] <rook2pawn> say <div class='foo'>my div</div>  <style>div.foo { cursor:pointer;} div.foo:hover {text-decoration:underline;}</style>
[01:25:59] <Ankabout> how can I test whether the current element has a certain class?
[01:26:06] <coldhead> ?is @ Ankabout
[01:26:07] <bot-t> Ankabout, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector and return true if at least one of these elements matches the selector. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[01:26:10] <goshawk> ok thanks
[01:26:16] <coldhead> .is('.someclass')
[01:27:06] <Ankabout> coldhead, so $(this).is('.active')  should work right?
[01:28:00] <coldhead> yup!
[01:28:06] <coldhead> that will return true or false
[01:28:21] <Ankabout> ah cool
[01:28:25] <goshawk> coldhead, can i change the css from jquery itself? so when i bind the click() event i set the div:hover too ?
[01:28:25] <Ankabout> and if I need a negative?
[01:28:29] <Ankabout> isnot() ?
[01:28:29] <Ankabout> haha
[01:28:42] <coldhead> ?not
[01:28:42] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[01:28:49] <coldhead> hmm
[01:29:02] <coldhead> .is(':not(.someclass)')
[01:29:14] <coldhead> ?css @ goshawk
[01:29:14] <bot-t> goshawk, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[01:29:22] <coldhead> check the docs, you can set css with that
[01:29:52] <goshawk> k
[01:30:24] <Ankabout> coldhead, thanks, works perfectly!

[01:36:21] <coldhead> you mad genius
[01:36:30] <coldhead> have you been contcted by the illuminati?
[01:36:38] <coldhead> i guess you won't admit to it if you have
[01:37:18] <juha____> i would have to kill you if i would tell..
[01:37:37] <coldhead> forget i asked!
[01:37:40] <coldhead> what was the problem?
[01:37:47] <coldhead> dining philosophers?
[01:38:01] <juha____> it was aids
[01:38:06] <coldhead> hahahaha
[01:38:10] <coldhead> thanks for solving that then!

[01:43:32] <juha____> oh fuck i messed up with the email subject line
[01:43:41] <juha____> lool
[01:44:05] <coldhead> did you do it in php?
[01:44:39] <juha____> yes
[01:45:00] <coldhead> fuck there is no way i could do this >: |
[01:45:03] <mazzachre> I am creating a UI control, and I want to make it fetch data on creation (using ajax) and then draw something more (I initialize the widget first, then I fetch data, then I put data in table that was initialized before) But I can't make it do that :( I get to calling the ajax, which works fine, the data is returned as expected, but the function I then do (this._setData) is never called, I bet it is something with context, but I can't quite figure it out.
[01:45:03] <mazzachre> ..
[01:46:09] <juha____> coldhead: it was pretty simple. just use shrooms mixed with lcd and it will clear up
[01:46:10] <mazzachre> It is fairly simple for now, where I do fetch: function() {$.get(url, action, this._setData, "json");}, _setData: function(data) {...}
[01:53:13] <coldhead> mazzachre: try var foo = this._setData; before the .get(). then in the get do $.get(url,action,foo, etc);
[01:53:28] <coldhead> my guess is this is changing
[01:55:23] <mazzachre> ok, I will try that
[01:56:27] <mazzachre> coldhead: No change'
[01:57:14] <mbutubuntu> hello folks, how to set an infinite timeout in ajax timeout variable?
[01:57:23] <coldhead> ?p @ mazzachre
[01:57:23] <bot-t> mazzachre, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[01:57:43] <coldhead> a working demo would really help, otherwise check the firebug/web dev console for an error
[02:00:21] <coldhead> mbutubuntu: my guess would be to add timeout:0 to your ajax options. failing that, timeout:Infinity and failing that: timeout:10e9999
[02:00:53] <mbutubuntu> ok
[02:00:59] <mazzachre> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/zUGgS/1/
[02:03:05] <coldhead> mazzachre: try making a less anonymous function and using that
[02:03:12] <coldhead> _setData: function setMahData(data) {
[02:03:19] <coldhead> the you can call setMahData
[02:03:26] <coldhead> and not bother with the this AIDS
[02:04:22] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/zUGgS/2/
[02:07:09] <mazzachre> coldhead: setMahData not defined... When I run that script instead
[02:08:36] <coldhead> oh for god's sake
[02:08:49] <coldhead> don't tell me the order of declaration is significant
[02:09:00] <coldhead> i'm sorry mazzachre, i am way out of my depth
[02:09:15] <coldhead> hang onto that original jsfiddle and wait for someone with a clue to help out
[02:09:29] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[02:10:02] <mazzachre> :)
[02:11:35] <balr0g> hello, is there some plugin to have kinda posting articles functionality?? articles or comments, something like that
[02:15:01] <goshawk> from $(this) how can i go up the DOM tree by N elements ?
[02:15:53] <coldhead> .parent().parent().parent()...parent()
[02:16:06] <goshawk> coldhead, ok thanks
[02:16:25] <coldhead> should write yourself a little plugin to make that nicer
[02:16:37] <coldhead> .nthparent(7) or whatever
[02:16:41] <goshawk> uhm
[02:16:48] <goshawk> yeah, sure
[02:16:50] <coldhead> PUT IT ON THE TODOLIST
[02:16:59] <goshawk> ;)
[02:18:01] <r3v3rb> can someone tell me hw do I get the classes attached to $(this) when it returns an object
[02:18:07] <r3v3rb> how*
[02:19:18] <coldhead> $(this).attr('class')
[02:19:52] <r3v3rb> ok
[02:19:55] <balr0g> hello, is there some plugin to easy post articles/comments? thanks
[02:19:57] <r3v3rb> cheers
[02:21:03] <coldhead> balr0g: i use disqus http://disqus.com/
[02:21:29] <mazzachre> OK, I seem to have found the problem here... Or at least located the source... Ajax is called in global context, so the function needs to be in global context... I will look into this a bit further...
[02:22:35] <balr0g> ok, checking
[02:23:42] <datarecall> i am doing some ajax and i want to search the return msg to see if it says error in it, what is the best way to do that
[02:24:04] <queden> hi folks. When I want to replace a content in a page with load, the content will first disappear and then be replaced with the new one. This is leading to my content to be scrolled up (once load() called) and once the new content is loaded the window won't scroll back to the position prior to the load() call. Is there any way to load the new content at the place of the old one but only when it is ready (thus avoiding to have tempora
[02:24:04] <queden> ry empty space that leads to a scroll to top)?
[02:24:15] <coldhead> ?contains @ datarecall
[02:24:15] <bot-t> datarecall, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[02:24:24] <Woet> queden: show your code
[02:24:31] <datarecall> bot-t would you jsut do an if statement ?
[02:24:44] <Woet> datarecall: i don't think bot-t will answer you
[02:24:48] <datarecall> lol
[02:24:49] <datarecall> coldhead
[02:24:52] <datarecall> getting tired :)
[02:25:09] <sisko> Can anyone tell me how to use the DETACH function?  I tried $('div#quicktabs_tabpage_1_1 div#custom-page-node-block-output-right').detach(); and $.detach('div#custom-page-node-block-output-right'); unsuccessfully
[02:25:10] <coldhead> if ($(data).is(':contains(error)')) alert("ERROR ERROR ERROR");
[02:25:20] <queden> Woet, okay, I am coding locally but I will upload it, just a minute
[02:26:04] <datarecall> thanks coldhead
[02:26:54] <queden> Woet, http://pastebin.com/XbYfGHwc I hope it is understandable (it is part of a big code), line 128
[02:33:11] <queden> Woet, one solution would be to replace the content only once the new one is ready
[02:33:41] <nisseni> I'm doing this: http://pastie.org/private/s4jprucmbzvdvit97qk00g - I want to load preview.php in the div #preview with the form data. It loads and all, but with var_dump($_POST); I don't get a result, however, I see the result in firebug ... any ideas?
[02:33:44] <datarecall> coldhead one more question: if (jQuery(msg).is(':contains(ERROR)')) colorbox({width:"50%", inline:true, href:"#notify_error"}); how would you call the colorbox function with that
[02:36:23] <coldhead> no idea i'm sorry
[02:36:39] <datarecall> np see what i can find around colorbox docs
[02:37:03] <nisseni> noone?
[02:37:39] <datarecall> hmm ok i see the :contains(ERROR) is not firing properly
[02:40:12] <coldhead> datarecall: my idea relies on data being an html string
[02:40:24] <sdfsdf> i have a <select id="mydropdown" .. and i attach $('#mydropdown').change(function () {... how can i get the value of selected item in this function?
[02:40:26] <mazzachre> Uhm, how do I pass arguments to a method in jQueryUI? I have worked out that if I do $.ajax(this.options.url, {data: {action: "GET_CUSTOMERS"}, context: this.element, success: function(data) {$(this).customermanager('setData', data)}}); I get the correct function called (setData on the UI) yet, I don't get the data argument passed along... How to do that?
[02:40:42] <mazzachre> sdfsdf: .val()
[02:40:53] <datarecall> ok i just wrapped <p> around it
[02:41:03] <datarecall> thanks coldhead
[02:41:08] <coldhead> good thinking~
[02:41:17] <mazzachre> sdfsdf: $(this).val() will give you the selected item
[02:41:20] <coldhead> you're not as tired as you claim >_>
[02:41:23] <datarecall> hehe
[02:41:29] <datarecall> getting there
[02:47:07] <mazzachre> So, anyone knows how to parse data to a function for jQueryUI?
[02:47:47] <ryrych> hi
[02:48:47] <ryrych> where would you put common data for all instanced of jQuery ui plugin? only one structure is created? would it be the same scope as all methods or the structure root element via .data?
[02:49:09] <ryrych> all instanced should have access to the data
[02:49:16] <ryrych> *instances
[02:53:13] <queden> Woet, I am solving this issue with a min-height property to avoid the content div to be reduced to zero during load(). Dirty hack, but it's the only solution I found so far
[02:55:47] <Woet> queden: you could use .get/.post instead of .load
[02:55:57] <Woet> and use the onSuccess handler
[02:57:40] <queden> Woet, ok, I will try that, using ajax right?
[02:57:49] <Woet> yea
[02:58:34] <queden> Woet, I have another question, in the same code, everytime I load a new content, I have to reload the rateit plugin, but also the facebook one. However, reloadting rateit will work, but not facebook. How come's?

[03:16:29] <SnowPlane> Hello there.
[03:17:00] <SnowPlane> Is there a way to check if the script has loaded? I want to hide a portion of my html until a script is fully loaded. How do I do that?
[03:17:10] <ryrych> any jQuery ui hacker here who could ask my question?
[03:17:17] <coldhead> SnowPlane: have the script unhide it
[03:17:20] <coldhead> ?cc
[03:17:21] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[03:17:23] <is_null> coldhead: thanks, what do you mean cross fade ? imgA.fadeOut(); imgB.fadeIn() ?
[03:17:34] <coldhead> m|kael: http://jsfiddle.net/ja7Lk/1/
[03:17:38] <coldhead> is_null: exactly!
[03:17:47] <k_89> m | kaeil you need to change image on mousedown event right
[03:17:49] <m|kael> coldhead: thanks, ill check it out =)
[03:17:51] <coldhead> the tricky part is to get the images to sit on top of each other in CSS
[03:18:10] <SnowPlane> coldhead: Brilliant. So add a style="display:none;" to the div and at the end of the script add some code to remove it?
[03:18:55] <coldhead> sounds good SnowPlane
[03:19:46] <SnowPlane> coldhead: Cool, thanks. Any clue where in the documentation I should look for that code?
[03:19:47] <datarecall> if you have <li><a class="test"><span class="listing">Remove</span></a></li> why doesnt jQuery('.test').innerHTML = msg; get rid of the <span>
[03:20:15] <SnowPlane> coldhead: Removing a style-tag from an div with an id I mean.
[03:20:36] <coldhead> why not use $('.test').html(msg), datarecall ?
[03:21:01] <coldhead> oh also $('.test') returns a jQuery object, not a DOM element
[03:21:09] <coldhead> so it doesn't have an innerHTML
[03:21:17] <datarecall> gotcha :)
[03:21:18] <datarecall> thanks
[03:21:30] <coldhead> ?show @ SnowPlane
[03:21:31] <bot-t> SnowPlane, .show(): Display the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/show/
[03:22:12] <SnowPlane> coldhead: Brilliant! Thank you, kind sir.
[03:23:32] <mazzachre> Damned... this just don't work well :( Nothing happens and I can't figure out why...
[03:24:08] <balr0g> hey, do anybody knows some "image slider" that fits the image to the size of the container (like 100% 100%) ? please ? can anyone could recommend a good "image slider"??
[03:24:11] <mazzachre> And it seems I am writing $.proxy(this, 'something') more than anything else...
[03:25:03] <coldhead> balr0g: http://buildinternet.com/2009/02/supersized-full-screen-backgroundslideshow-jquery-plugin/
[03:25:15] <mazzachre> And following my program step by step seems to show that creating a dialog-widget inside a widget does work, but telling that dialog to show does nothing :(
[03:25:54] <coldhead> mazzachre: ajpiano is probably the best person to help with that, if you can wait for him to wake up
[03:26:21] <is_null> coldhead: thanks!
[03:26:31] <datarecall> coldhead anything else I can try it doesnt seem to be replacing the .html
[03:26:47] <mazzachre> Perhaps... I am not sure I want to go on with it... I have a really ugly version where everything is global variables and global functions, and it works... but it is hell to bugfix and even worse to reuse...
[03:27:24] <coldhead> $('.test').html('lol AIDS') really should work
[03:27:36] <balr0g> coldhead, ok, do you know it? i have seen it somewhere before... it looks like fill to browser window, do you know some that fits to the little container i need?
[03:28:06] <coldhead> sorry balr0g, i don't know how to do that, i would just try to use CSS
[03:28:39] <balr0g> coldhead, ok thnaks, will be trying
[03:29:25] <datarecall> one last thing and im getting out of your hair :) im using document ready to monitor .clicks , but on this ajax success i am changing the class of a href so its not monitoring the right href would i use .live instead of doc ready ?
[03:29:58] <coldhead> sounds like it!
[03:30:22] <coldhead> well guessed
[03:30:53] <iforce> Your favourite pagination plugin, ideally making capable of handling new items being prepended to the list of items?
[03:30:54] <datarecall> hehe other then as soon as i use .live it errors out saying (d || "").split is not a function /js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.4.4 Line 76
[03:32:06] <coldhead> .live('click', function () {... etc ...}) ?

[03:34:42] <coldhead> but yes, same deal mostly
[03:34:46] <balexandre> the hole DVCS idea is just like Hg.
[03:34:52] <coldhead> whole*
[03:34:53] <balexandre> not really, just trying to know Git better
[03:34:54] <coldhead> yes
[03:34:55] <iivvoo> consider asking on #git
[03:35:11] <balexandre> I know Hg, and started to look at http://gitref.org/index.html
[03:35:48] <balexandre> though it seam very close, and in my head, would be nice to know if they are almost the same or not at all :)
[03:35:55] <coldhead> they are almost the same
[03:35:56] <balexandre> op
[03:35:57] <coldhead> i use both
[03:35:59] <balexandre> LOl
[03:36:06] <balexandre> wrong channel gyus, so sorry
[03:36:16] <is_null> coldhead: but how to superpose them ?

[03:42:08] <ndee> coldhead, sweet, thanks
[03:42:48] <SnowPlane> coldhead: If it's your first time visiting the site, the slider wont work, you will have to have been there before without "reseting" your browser.
[03:42:54] <SnowPlane> coldhead: See what I mean?
[03:42:56] <coldhead> oh god SnowPlane, i remember this from a few days ago
[03:43:03] <xsamurai> im appending href links from an iframe pop to the parent page and i have added a click function for the href's yet it doesnt seem to fire , i added a test link on the parent page with the same class name and it works fine
[03:43:11] <SnowPlane> coldhead: Hahah
[03:43:33] <balr0g> SnowPlane, what image slider are you using there man?
[03:44:15] <iivvoo> is there a way to bind a piece of <script> to the tag it's defined in? Eg. pseudo code <div id="#blabla">....<script>(somehow get a reference to div#blabla)</script></div>
[03:44:19] <cybin> SnowPlane: Hm... I've loaded the page the first time and the images are changing.
[03:44:29] <iivvoo> I don't easily know the div's id, else I'd just $("#blabla")
[03:44:43] <SnowPlane> balr0g: "Nivo-Slider", it's pretty awesome.
[03:44:52] <SnowPlane> cybin: Never been there before?
[03:45:11] <cybin> SnowPlane: yep. I didn't know this site before.
[03:45:21] <SnowPlane> Reset your browser and try again.
[03:45:22] <coldhead> i'm on a slow connection and it's still loading THE FIRST TIME for me so i'm gonna sit this bug out >: |
[03:45:30] <SnowPlane> Haha
[03:45:32] <SnowPlane> ^^
[03:45:33] <balr0g> SnowPlane, ok man, tks
[03:45:50] <SnowPlane> "Worked" this time?
[03:46:01] <bianchi> hi everybody. How to check with jquery if my window is popup window?
[03:46:04] <cybin> SnowPlane: retried it with my mac and it's working too.
[03:46:33] <SnowPlane> Doesnt work with Chrome on both Mac and Windows.
[03:46:54] <SnowPlane> So I guess the problem might be limited to Chrome (webkit?)
[03:47:00] <balr0g> SnowPlane, im trying, i see all normal , whats the matter.. what script you mean?
[03:47:16] <balr0g> SnowPlane, im on Windows/Chrome
[03:47:37] <SnowPlane> balr0g: slider.js is the nivo-slider, and derp.js starts the slider.
[03:47:42] <cybin> SnowPlane: Well, I can confirm it working with Safari (Mac) 5.0.5 Build 6533.21.1
[03:47:42] <johanhar> Hi. How can I make a list or array or some type of structure, of all <input> elements inside a <div>?
[03:48:27] <coldhead> ?map @ johanhar
[03:48:28] <bot-t> johanhar, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[03:48:40] <balr0g> SnowPlane, again, im on Windws/Chrome i see all normal man, how to crash it?
[03:48:44] <SnowPlane> cybin: Yeah... I guess it might be my connection, cause I've tried every browser I have on both OSX and Win7
[03:48:48] <johanhar> Thanks
[03:49:36] <lugzer> hi
[03:50:00] <SnowPlane> Thanks for the help tho. Might be a problem with my network, and prehaps someone elses, so I just add a session cookie and a header(); to make sure it always works.
[03:50:12] <SnowPlane> ^ php
[03:50:14] <cybin> SnowPlane: anyway, this page is sweet. good job. :)
[03:50:26] <johanhar> Are there any difference on saying $ and jQuery? Is one of them "old" and the other "new way todo it"?
[03:50:32] <SnowPlane> cybin: Thanks, and thanks for checking if it worked for you. ^^
[03:50:38] <johanhar> $.map vs jQuery.map
[03:50:52] <coldhead> $ is less typing
[03:51:00] <coldhead> you can use whichever you prefer
[03:51:02] <johanhar> Ok no difference then, thanks
[03:51:23] <coldhead> ?eval $ == jQuery
[03:51:24] <bot-t> coldhead: true
[03:51:45] <coldhead> ?eval $ === jQuery
[03:51:46] <bot-t> coldhead: true
[03:52:21] <balr0g> i like twitter UI...
[03:52:35] <lugzer> hey i've got a strange problem with simple stuff - each checkbox clicked should append a css class to the parent <tr> (found with .closest()) .. .but it works only when i add a breakpoint in firebug.. anyone spots as issue? : http://jsfiddle.net/thBUy/1/
[03:53:38] <lugzer> ok looks like sync issue (i load the table with ajax...)
[03:54:07] <xsamurai> can someone take a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/gyCvr/
[03:54:21] <johanhar> I am working on a project, trying to update all JS libraries to jquery (for now there are many). $$("#someDiv input"), is this jQuery for making a list of all inputs inside someDiv?
[03:54:44] <odyniec> lugzer: try .live() then
[03:55:21] <balr0g> xsamurai, whats the matter?
[03:55:55] <xsamurai> balr0g: i was hoping to for the appended link to behave same as the original link
[03:55:57] <xsamurai> in the div
[03:56:03] <odyniec> johanhar: that looks like Prototype syntax, for jQuery it would be just one $
[03:56:05] <balr0g> xsamurai, should work with remove's strings too?
[03:56:06] <SnowPlane> Best way to refresh a page ONCE?
[03:56:20] <lugzer> odyniec, i'm thinking of .complete() for .post() which is used there... but not sure if that will work
[03:56:23] <johanhar> odyniec: thanks a lot :)
[03:56:25] <xsamurai> balr0g: yes
[03:58:13] <xsamurai> i thought it was pretty simple process yes it doesnt seem to work in that way
[03:58:20] <xsamurai> maybe im missing something
[03:59:09] <lugzer> odyniec, live works thanks ;) co tam slychac w Rennes
[03:59:14] <balr0g> xsamurai, outside jsfiddle, can you check what html is rendered, on your developen environment.. ?
[03:59:32] <xsamurai> balr0g: <a href='#' class='remove'>Remove - </a>
[04:00:25] <balr0g> xsamurai, is your div container having the correct rendered html, as you expect?
[04:00:47] <xsamurai> balr0g: yes, oddly enough its the same result in jsfiddle
[04:00:55] <xsamurai> so i dont know how its suppose to be done
[04:01:37] <SnowPlane> Any idea why $(window).load(function() works, but not $(document).load(function()?
[04:03:23] <coldhead> document doesn't fire a load event
[04:03:27] <xsamurai> anybody else like to take a crack at it http://jsfiddle.net/gyCvr/
[04:06:00] <balr0g> ican't see the error
[04:06:20] <xsamurai> balr0g: right but its not functioning as it should logically
[04:07:08] <balr0g> xsamurai, $(".remove") will hang ALL elements with class='remove', right?
[04:07:50] <xsamurai> hang ?, its meant to append additional links
[04:07:55] <xsamurai> like test does
[04:08:40] <balr0g> sorry, it will catch all elements with the class remove
[04:09:20] <xsamurai> yes any links with class = remove will have that function applied on clicking
[04:10:51] <balr0g> this is odd
[04:10:57] <coldhead> ?mlu
[04:10:57] <bot-t> much like urself
[04:11:20] <xsamurai> coldhead: stop molesting the bot
[04:11:45] <coldhead> sorry
[04:12:10] <balr0g> coldhead, did you saw it? http://jsfiddle.net/gyCvr/ ?? easy task, odd problem...
[04:12:47] <johanhar> I want all checked elements to a div, and find their ID. Inside each() function, how can I ask $(this) (which is the checked element right?) for it's ID? Thanks
[04:13:10] <johanhar> Or to make it easier, how can I ask $(this) for it's ID
[04:13:35] <balr0g> johanhar, can't you do $(this).attr('id') ?
[04:14:09] <johanhar> The same second you answered I found the .attr on the API site :) Thank
[04:14:12] <johanhar> thanks*
[04:14:24] <balr0g> xP
[04:18:54] <mayersd> I'm wondering whether there is a way, in this example : http://jsfiddle.net/pFDPd/ , where I can keep all the elements in place and when the mouse is over the element with ".container" then ".pContainer" is displayed. However, I want it displayed over ".otherContent". right now it is moving the elements down to display it. ?
[04:19:17] <SugaSlide> layers?
[04:19:56] <balr0g> xsamurai, why is there a space between TEST remove and not between removeremove ?
[04:20:33] <xsamurai> because its >remove</a> instead of >remove </a>
[04:20:42] <xsamurai> put a space and it will show up
[04:21:16] <xsamurai> maybe the first one gets a space due to how append works
[04:21:20] <xsamurai> not really sure about that
[04:21:34] <balr0g> xsamurai, but i dont get why there is a space between TEST and first remove... where is that space?
[04:21:44] <balr0g> hmm ..ok
[04:22:03] <balr0g> i liked to see the rendered html code
[04:22:21] <xsamurai> you can use firebug
[04:22:21] <mayersd> SugaSlide:  for layers you need to have a bounding box with position: relative is that right ? and then have the inside element with position:absolute; top and left attributes set. I think what I'm looking for is the element to be displayed outside of the bounding box. I've tried to place a negative top left attributes and it's not working
[04:24:18] <balr0g> ok, i didnt see that space...
[04:26:03] <xsamurai> i dont know if its because its late but i cant seem to figure what im doing wrong on something so basic
[04:27:31] <balr0g> xsamurai, sorry, you can wait for some other to check this man...
[04:28:18] <ndee> what's the easiest way to work with jquery and cookies?
[04:28:22] <xsamurai> balr0g: np, thanks for the help though, i'll try to ask this question in the morning
[04:28:55] <balr0g> xsamurai, ok, thats good man.. also im a little bit curious, lol
[04:29:00] <SugaSlide> mayersd yeah
[04:29:03] <g0> is the themeroller server side code open source?
[04:30:39] <mayersd> SugaSlide: http://jsfiddle.net/pFDPd/5/ check out this update it shows what I mean
[04:31:34] <SugaSlide> http://jsfiddle.net/pFDPd/6/
[04:31:37] <SugaSlide> hmm
[04:32:07] <SugaSlide> so you want abc to be above content goes here?
[04:33:01] <ndee> ?mdc cookies
[04:33:06] <bot-t> ndee, document.cookie - MDC Docs - Get and set the cookies associated with the current document. https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Document.cookie
[04:33:07] <mayersd> Yeah I want ABC to be above "Content Goes Here" so it's technically overlapping OtherContent
[04:34:40] <SugaSlide> http://jsfiddle.net/pFDPd/7/
[04:34:57] <LYoung> does anyone know where I can get GalleryView?
[04:35:19] <Shwaiil> hi ppl
[04:35:32] <Shwaiil> Q: How to select a form by name ? tks
[04:35:34] <LYoung> the spaceforaname.com address I have keeps taking me to a page saying the account has been suspended
[04:35:53] <SugaSlide> form[name="thename"]
[04:35:59] <Shwaiil> SugaSlide, tks
[04:36:36] <mayersd> SugaSlide: wait, that's exactly what I want... what did you do ? I tried doing something similar. The only thing I can see, I think is that you've applied postion: absolute and position:relative to .container is that right ?
[04:37:20] <SugaSlide> position relative to the containers
[04:37:33] <SugaSlide> and absolute to the content block things
[04:37:41] <SugaSlide> absolute kinda does the whole layer thing
[04:38:02] <mayersd> Ahh right gotcha. Thank you
[04:38:22] <rns> I am using a hidden form field on a form I am using with ajax, so my server side code can check for the form name (it's not submitted without the hidden field).  I also have a second submit button(to add a new blank form) with a different name.  But this isn't working now.  Any ideas?
[04:38:32] <daffodil> I have a dropdown box.m using jquery $ajax{} to send data to another page but i m not receving data to that page
[04:40:32] <SnowPlane> If I use useragent IE6 in Safari, will it act like IE6 with the script too? Because it feels odd that it would run that smooth in ie6.
[04:40:35] <SnowPlane> ?
[04:41:20] <daffodil> Utkarsh:  I have a dropdown box.m using jquery $ajax{} to send data to another page but i m not receving data to that page
[04:46:37] <delivi> SnowPlane: that's not possible
[04:50:02] <sdfsdf> how to get the text of the selected item in <select
[04:50:31] <sdfsdf> $(this).val() gives the id but i like to get the text
[04:50:50] <geekbuntu> .text()?
[04:52:05] <sdfsdf> .text() gets all the text of the items .. not just the selected item
[04:52:30] <geekbuntu> you have a snippet?
[04:54:34] <SnowPlane> coldhead: Found what made me having to refresh twice: head.js is suppose to make the site load faster, by cashing. Duh.
[04:56:45] <sdfsdf> http://pastebin.com/EghsqD6K
[04:59:02] <Woet> sdfsdf: $("#list option[value='"+ $("#list").val() +"']").text()
[04:59:16] <Woet> or, even better
[04:59:23] <Woet> sdfsdf: $("#list option:selected").text()
[05:00:44] <sdfsdf> thanks woet
[05:18:42] <KanKouni> good day everyone
[05:19:34] <KanKouni> if i'm loading a page $("#div").load("path/page.html"); , how can i make sure if its already loaded or not
[05:21:39] <sear|work> KanKouni: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[05:21:56] <sear|work> I'm no expert, but it appears that you can feed in a status variable, which the method will report back to
[05:22:11] <sear|work> And you check on the status of that variable to tell whether or not the load was successful
[05:22:16] <KanKouni> thanks
[05:22:34] <sear|work> Yup
[05:22:34] <vladyn> hello everybody
[05:22:37] <sear|work> Hi ther
[05:22:38] <sear|work> *there
[05:23:03] <vladyn> I'm trying $.ajax with user/pass to fetch remotely hosted jsonp
[05:23:21] <vladyn> but it fails in FF Firebug sends error
[05:23:29] <vladyn> but I can see the object
[05:23:40] <vladyn> this is with 1.61
[05:24:55] <seutje> whatever u do, don't mention the exact error, this could be far too useful in debugging your problem, can't have that
[05:25:34] <vladyn> yes but cant reach the success callback
[05:25:39] <vladyn> only error
[05:28:15] <s0enke> hi
[05:30:22] <s0enke> i need a name for a (i guess so) pattern: a) have ajax requests queued and serialized in a channel so i can work pseudo-offline, b) send a checksum with each (POST) call - to avoid conflicts like people opened several tabs
[05:30:47] <s0enke> those are 2 patterns, imho, tho ;)
[05:32:04] <m4rtijn> hi all
[05:32:24] <m4rtijn> i have a small problem and im not sure what im looking for.. so I cant google it..
[05:33:37] <m4rtijn> I have a link> <a class="contact" href="ajax_handler.php?id=1231> -- this eventually responds with a json encoded array.. how would I setup a jquery script which then receives this array?
[05:35:22] <m4rtijn> $(a.contact).click.function() fire when its clicked.. how do i fire a function on the xhtml response?
[05:41:43] <delivi> m4rtijn: use $('a.contact').click(function () { }); to define the click handler
[05:57:26] <lugzer> hey i've got a simple function highlighting a table row when checkbox selected (using .live()), and another which selects all checkboxes in a table (also using .live()).. however when all checkboxes are selected it looks like the highlight doesn't get executed.. any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/69a4X/2/
[06:00:19] <bbttxu> lugzer: looks like you're highlighting the td not the tr
[06:00:36] <johncarlson21> hello all
[06:00:46] <johncarlson21> anyone in here to answer a few quick questions?
[06:01:07] <lugzer> bbttxu, well i'm highlighting the (tr td) and that's okay. problem is the .live() doesn't pickup the change when all checkboxes are selected
[06:02:00] <lugzer> bbttxu, i'm just adding a class to tr and the css does the trick. but that's not important..
[06:03:18] <johncarlson21> alright I'm using jquery mobile, and I'm using a collapsible container. I want to put another button on the banner (<h3>) I get it to work, but for some reason the z-index on iphone isn't working
[06:03:26] <bbttxu> lugzer, might want to trigger a 'change' event on the checkboxes
[06:03:40] <johncarlson21> is there a better way?
[06:03:42] <bbttxu> which should fire off the first function and highlight your tr
[06:04:11] <lugzer> bbttxu, there is such function in my code i pasted. first one
[06:04:33] <lugzer> */event
[06:06:16] <bbttxu> right, but you should $('table tr td :checkbox').trigger('change')
[06:06:28] <bbttxu> so that function gets executed....
[06:06:57] <lugzer> bbttxu, yeah but there is live() .. isn't that the proper event?
[06:07:07] <bbttxu> that's a listener
[06:07:14] <lugzer> right.
[06:07:23] <lugzer> let me look up trigger()
[06:07:24] <bbttxu> so that when the change event fires on that element it will do it's thing
[06:07:46] <lugzer> okay i get it
[06:08:01] <lugzer> i thought that prop() would fire an event
[06:08:03] <bbttxu> the second function only sets the attribute of that same element. AFAICT there is no implicit 'click' or 'change' event that happens with that. you have to do it yourself
[06:08:53] <bbttxu> no mention of events on http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[06:09:16] <lugzer> you're right
[06:09:20] <lugzer> trigger is slow
[06:10:02] <lugzer> i will just add class.. was faster
[06:10:10] <lugzer> but thanks for the info. good to know this
[06:10:28] <Predator> hi
[06:10:45] <lugzer> trigger() is probably better for firing single event rather than doing it for many table rows..
[06:11:02] <Predator> how can i work with $.each value? if its inside a class can I get it ?
[06:20:12] <Pinehead> I'm trying to grab the only (or first) img tag on a page.  i'm using $('img').src("change here"); and it doesn't seem to like that.
[06:20:13] <Michael> What are some lazy loading libraries?
[06:20:14] <Pinehead> Any thoughts?
[06:20:21] <Michael> I'm trying to remember one that was suggested to me last winter
[06:20:37] <Michael> $('img:first')[0].src
[06:20:43] <bbttxu> labjs
[06:20:46] <Michael> thanks! That's it
[06:20:50] <bbttxu> yepnope
[06:21:20] <Jon47> i think headjs is another one
[06:21:57] <Michael> LABjs is the one Paul Irish recommended last year
[06:22:01] <Michael> Thanks a lot
[06:22:45] <Pinehead> so $("img:first")[0].attr("src" ,"new link location");
[06:22:49] <Pinehead> what does the [0] do?
[06:22:55] <Michael> [0] grabs the DOM element
[06:23:01] <Michael> As opposed to $('img') which is a jQuery object
[06:23:09] <Michael> For the syntax you just pasted you would use the jQuery object
[06:23:14] <Michael> $('img:first').attr('src', ...
[06:23:30] <Michael> But in your first one you had $('img').src which won't work
[06:23:48] <Pinehead> ok, thank you.
[06:25:24] <johncarlson21> is there a way to change the handle (click able element) for a collapsible container
[06:26:58] <Pinehead> Should i use it inside of $(document.ready ?
[06:28:07] <Michael> Pinehead, That's up to you. As long as jQuery is loaded before your code that depends on it is executed you'll be fine.
[06:28:35] <Pinehead> just doesn't seem to be working.
[06:32:33] <kephu> hi
[06:32:40] <kephu> anyone here familiar with jstree?
[06:32:52] <Shwaiil> hi ppl
[06:34:19] <Shwaiil> Q: I'm wondering why .submit() is not worknig for me, here's the code (I'm not finding any error): http://pastie.org/2066590 . My question is, if this is correct, why the submit event is not being triggered ? thank you
[06:34:56] <Pinehead> give your form an id
[06:34:57] <Pinehead> then do
[06:35:01] <Pinehead> $("#forid").
[06:35:07] <Pinehead> *formid
[06:35:17] <kephu> Shwaiil: was the form loaded via ajax?
[06:35:32] <Shwaiil> kephu, no :T
[06:35:57] <Shwaiil> I'm wrapping the function inside an anonymous function and it seems to work
[06:36:24] <Shwaiil> dunno, maybe there's some error around on the actual html. I'm just placing a form in existing page
[06:40:53] <slyguy> please i'm having issues with jQuery.parseJSON in firefox browser, it works fine on other standard browsers. I keep getting this error in firebug console "missing ] after element list"
[06:40:53] <tilinho> Hi. $('input').focus() set the cursor afer the last char on ff, but selects the whole text on chrome. I really don't care, but my boss does. =/ anyone nows how to work it around?
[06:41:06] <slyguy> please what can i do?
[06:42:35] <alexidoia> quick question : with jQuery I am loading some html code and some javascript, how can I 'launch' the javascript present in that code, once it is added to the main page ?
[06:42:57] <tilinho> one odd thing: if I execute javascript:void($('input').focus()) on the chrome address bar it works as expected, but if i execute it on the debug console it doesnt
[06:44:59] <tilinho> alexidoia i think you cant
[06:45:44] <seutje> IE7 is so weird, isn't showing my absolutely positioned element, xcept if I do $(element).css('position', 'static').css('position', 'absolute'); at runtime o.O
[06:45:51] <Pinehead> can i pull the second image by using ('img:second') ?
[06:46:15] <seutje> Pinehead: how far do u assume those pseudo selectors to goe?
[06:46:26] <seutje> :millionth ?
[06:46:31] <Pinehead> was hoping..
[06:46:48] <seutje> u can make a :second if u want though :D
[06:47:07] <Pinehead> humbug
[06:47:29] <seutje> wat?
[06:47:35] <seutje> ?source :first
[06:47:49] * seutje kicks bot-t in the gonads
[06:48:01] <iszak> seutje, it's becoming increasingly buggy I've noticed.
[06:49:14] <janthony> I created a function and I'm trying to figure out how to send parameters to it. for example I tried function foo(param) { } then when I called it I did $("a").click(foo({ param: 'somevalue' }); Am I doing something wrong?
[06:49:28] <karstenk1977_> Hello
[06:49:44] <seutje> iszak: what is? IE7? isn't it in a frozen state?
[06:49:53] <iszak> no bot-t
[06:49:59] <seutje> oooh, my b
[06:50:09] <karstenk1977_> is there someone who can help to slide a little content?
[06:50:15] <karstenk1977_> http://pizza-nr1.com/bestellen/shop/catalog/category/view/pizza/0/
[06:50:16] <seutje> my ability to comprehend has taken a serious hit today
[06:50:35] <ryrych> how can anyone take a look at how to change the scope? http://jsfiddle.net/ndPaH/
[06:50:37] <karstenk1977_> i´m not very good in JS but I integrated the classes I need
[06:50:51] <Pinehead> seutije: To write that function would i use javascript and build to jquery?
[06:50:55] <ryrych> it is the most simple mockup I could make to explain this
[06:51:04] <karstenk1977_> now i only need the js which scrolls the content
[06:51:22] <ryrych> I run widget on many elements but there is only one structure
[06:51:42] <alexidoia> tilinho: humm so it is just for html code ?
[06:52:46] <tilinho> alexidoia if im not mistaken, js runs only on load, unless you call functions or user the jQuery.live events
[06:53:16] <tilinho> alexidoia i guess you could eval the js code, but that would be freaky
[06:53:23] <alexidoia> yes
[06:54:04] <ryrych> I add behaviour at first element so ‘this’ refers to that element. I would like to be ‘inside’ the element that is loaded
[06:54:49] <ryrych> any clues?
[06:57:23] <johanhar> If I want an <input> with a given class and value, how can I select this one?
[06:57:58] <johanhar> $('input.class') is ok, but also, with some value, what is the syntax? :)
[06:58:09] <karstenk1977_> can anybody help me plz?
[06:59:39] <Michael> Try $('input[value="Some Value"].class')
[06:59:46] <johanhar> Michael: thanks
[06:59:55] <Michael> Np hope it works :D
[07:00:11] <johanhar> are you sure it is not input.class[value="Some Value"]?
[07:00:31] <johanhar> Ill try both, np, thanks
[07:01:29] <ryrych> karstenk1977: what’s the problem?
[07:01:50] <karstenk1977_> I try to build a vertical content slider
[07:01:56] <karstenk1977_> http://pizza-nr1.com/bestellen/shop/catalog/category/view/pizza/0/
[07:03:06] <ryrych> karstenk1997: have you used .scrollTop()?
[07:03:07] <karstenk1977_> but i don´t know how to slide the left content, because its diffrent from category to category
[07:03:44] <karstenk1977_> I only implemented the jQuery classes, there is no js at the time
[07:04:03] <ryrych> karstenk1997: how this is supposed to work? could you tell me?
[07:05:28] <karstenk1977_> on the left side you see content elements or products. My JS should read how height is every li (which is everytime the same in one category) and how many li are there
[07:05:42] <Pinehead> Can i grab an element by it's source ?
[07:05:51] <karstenk1977_> and then it should slide them up and down for the height var
[07:05:53] <Pinehead> or just change an img src that i know?
[07:06:39] <karstenk1977_> so that everytime fits the content in the mask
[07:07:00] <karstenk1977_> sry about my terrible english, hoope you can understand
[07:07:03] <seutje> does this make sense to any1? var $list = $('#foo'); $list.css('position', $list.css('position')); coz it sure doesn't make any to me
[07:07:17] <ryrych> karstenk1977: I understant
[07:07:22] <ryrych> understand :D
[07:07:22] <janthony> If the console returns Object { source="loaded"} - how would I pull out the value of source with javascript?
[07:07:35] <seutje> obj.source
[07:07:43] <seutje> if ur object was aliased as obj
[07:07:44] <janthony> seutje: thanks!
[07:08:20] <janthony> seutje: well it's a param in my function foo (source) { console.log(source); }
[07:08:22] <ryrych> karstenk1977: so I would opt for removing the slider because sliders are suppose to work also on ‘part’ element
[07:08:26] <ryrych> elements
[07:08:27] <oliver117> I know it is odd, but for me the .load callback fires just before the DOM is manipulated, that can't be right, right?
[07:08:33] <seutje> janthony: source.source then I guess
[07:08:40] <ryrych> karstenk1977: I would add up and down arrows
[07:09:54] <karstenk1977_> thats not so practicable i think, because i do not want the user have to klick many times. i hope i can implemented mousewheel in future
[07:10:11] <ryrych> karstenk1977: ah, so the overall height in the same category (e.g Bestellen?) is the same?
[07:10:18] <oliver117> there is a jquery plugin for the mousewheel
[07:11:06] <ryrych> * the overall height of a li?
[07:11:07] <janthony> $("#main-nav a").click(loadContent({ source: 'clicked' })); - Any idea why this is triggering before I even click an anchor from #main-nav?
[07:11:16] <karstenk1977_> as an example all product li from category Pizza are 80px height, and from category pasta are 120px height
[07:11:27] <oliver117> wrap an anonymous function around
[07:11:41] <oliver117> $("#main-nav a").click(function() {loadContent({ source: 'clicked' })});
[07:11:43] <iivvoo> janthony, because whatever you pass to click() is evaluated.
[07:11:45] <iivvoo> right
[07:12:00] <oliver117> oh now there is a ; missing
[07:12:05] <oliver117> you'll figure it
[07:12:15] <ryrych> karstenk1977: ah, so this is pretty simple :D
[07:12:26] <karstenk1977_> ok, than let me know  ;-)
[07:13:27] <janthony> Ok, when I wrap that anonymous function around it, it changes $(this) in the object. So instead of $(this) being the anchor that was clicked it is now a Window object.
[07:13:49] <ryrych> so you divide the overall height of all LIs by number of elements, e.g 800 / 10 = 80 = one step
[07:13:56] <ryrych> let me elaborate :D
[07:14:25] <oliver117> janthony: IIRC $(this) should yield the clicked object
[07:14:28] <karstenk1977_> yes thats the way
[07:15:10] <karstenk1977_> and i have devide the slider in same way
[07:15:24] <ryrych> jquery ui plugin supports steps; then you scroll the container with .scrollTop() – container should have overflow: hidden
[07:15:28] <oliver117> I don't know wether it applies to jQuery aswell but in mootools you could just get the first LI's y position and then subtract the others
[07:15:54] <karstenk1977_> it has
[07:16:42] <ryrych> karstenk1977: give me 20 minutes or less, I'll try to do this
[07:16:56] <janthony> Before I put the anonymous function around it, $(this) returns [a who-is-infinit] (which is what I need) - however when I add the anonymous function around it, console returns [Window who-is-infinit].
[07:17:01] <karstenk1977_> yes but in this enviroment i developed interfaces between typo3/openerp/magento and them using jQuery and prototype. I think a third framework is too much^^
[07:17:33] <karstenk1977_> ok, thanks a lot ryrych
[07:20:31] <janthony> $("#main-nav a").click(function() { $(this).loadPageContent({ source: 'clicked' }); }); - I tried this to see if that would fix it, but it's saying .loadPageContent is not a function
[07:21:20] <janthony> If remove the $(this) it loads, but it sends the object as a window object, and a not an a element object
[07:22:29] <janthony> maybe I need to do $(this).function(loadPageContent())
[07:23:51] <danheberden> janthony, what is loadPageContent?
[07:24:25] <janthony> a function I made. http://pastie.org/2066846
[07:25:11] <danheberden> janthony you can't call any functions, like the ones of the jquery api ( the ones on it's prototype ) as properties of the jquery collection
[07:25:19] <danheberden> as you are trying with $(this).loadPageContent
[07:26:12] <danheberden> in that function, you have source.source - what is this supposed to be?
[07:26:27] <janthony> danheberden: no, I tried this: $("#main-nav a").click(function(loadPageContent ) { loadPageContent({ source: 'clicked' }); }); it works, but it's sending the wrong object, sending through as a window object vs anchor object
[07:26:43] <janthony> er, remove the first loadPageContent (typo)
[07:27:17] <danheberden> janthony function( loadPageContent ) isn't at all right
[07:27:22] <janthony> danheberden:  $("#main-nav a").click(function() { loadPageContent({ source: 'clicked' }); }); returns [Window who-is-infinit]
[07:27:28] <danheberden> like - you use the function keyword to declare a new function
[07:27:37] <danheberden> that ones looks better
[07:27:39] <danheberden> *one
[07:27:50] <janthony> danheberden: yeah, was a typo, was ctrl-z'ing and didn't go far enough back
[07:28:03] <danheberden> so - if you want to assign the 'this' of the function, like jquery does
[07:28:24] <danheberden> for yours, you can do loadPageContent.call( this, {source: 'clicked' } );
[07:28:29] <danheberden> ?mdc call
[07:28:47] <danheberden> no bot-t :(
[07:28:53] <jeffsmykil> Does anyone have any experience with jquery and the ASP Update Panel?
[07:29:04] <janthony> $("irc://irc.freenode.net/#main-nav a").click(function() { loadPageContent.call( this, { source: 'clicked' }); }); - like that?
[07:29:35] <danheberden> janthony http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html#Functions
[07:29:44] <danheberden> janthony yup
[07:30:01] <danheberden> assuming your irc client put in the the irc:// shit, heh
[07:30:30] <janthony> danheberden: yeah, it did, hehe. hrm, console.log($(this)) in my function is still returning that as a window object instead of element object with that code.
[07:31:36] <danheberden> janthony maybe you have another handler bound somewhere?
[07:33:06] <janthony> danheberden: http://pastie.org/2066846 - this is everything
[07:33:34] <janthony> danheberden: of course I have .ready wrapped around that
[07:33:39] <JKarsrud> hey guys
[07:33:54] <danheberden> janthony look at that paste
[07:33:57] <JKarsrud> is there a way that I can listen to the dom to see if a spesific element has been created?
[07:33:58] <danheberden> vs what you typed in here earlier
[07:34:00] <danheberden> and what i typed
[07:34:11] <danheberden> i.e. i don't see .call in there
[07:34:21] <danheberden> you are simply invoking loadPageContent
[07:34:42] <janthony> danheberden: ahh that was it. my appologies.
[07:34:52] <danheberden> so either use call, or change your function signature to function loadPageContent( element, source ) { ...
[07:34:58] <danheberden> and call it the way you are in your paste
[07:35:14] <danheberden> but definitely read that link i sent you re: functions and calling them 'n stuff
[07:35:22] <danheberden> its good info to have as a base while you're going into this
[07:35:29] <janthony> danheberden: working great now. thank you for patience. thanks! yeah I bookmarked it and will read it
[07:39:52] <is_null> hi all, i don't understand why the effect in the last box ("Create your personalized package") doesn't look smooth all the way: http://fk.yourlabs.org/fest/EU/France/Carhaix-Plouguer/vieilles-charrues-festival/
[07:39:58] <is_null> any idea ?
[07:40:42] <mazzachre> Anyone else been trying to match widgets and build-in ajax? With more success than I have had?
[07:41:07] <SeanLazer> hi guys, i'm having an issue with an ajax call in jquery 1.6.1.  i'm making the call and my log is saying it receives it and is returning status 200, but only my error callback gets called, and nothing gets printed to my JS console
[07:41:11] <SeanLazer> here's the call: https://gist.github.com/1025028
[07:41:41] <mazzachre> SeanLazer: Just a thought, are you expecting some type (like JSON or XML) and sending back something that is not parsing?
[07:42:02] <SeanLazer> mazzachre: no, i'm expecting HTML back
[07:42:23] <mazzachre> SeanLazer: Then you should set type to expect html, otherwise it defaults to XML afaik
[07:42:49] <SeanLazer> mazzachre: oh is that right?  let me try that
[07:43:33] <mazzachre> And the error would get called if the html returned was not proper XML parsable...
[07:43:38] <SeanLazer> mazzachre: hey that did it!  thanks.  any idea when that was changed?  i used to never have to explicitly set datatype if i was just expecting HTML or a string
[07:44:01] <cyty> hi everyone
[07:45:34] <cyty> has anyone had a problem so far with element.each() malfunctioning when you have two string.match(/regexp/) inside of it?
[07:47:19] <alexidoia> if I load some external html with loadPage, will I be able to target any of its content with document.getElementById() ?
[07:48:51] <alexidoia> anyone ?
[07:49:30] <cyty> where do you load it? usually you can process it in the success function of the $.ajax() you're using
[07:49:41] <slyguy> please i'm having issues with jQuery.parseJSON in firefox browser, it works fine on other standard browsers. I keep getting this error in firebug console "missing ] after element list"
[07:50:14] <cyty> does it point out a line?
[07:50:52] <ch3mi0n> Yo
[07:51:13] <slyguy> #join /javascript
[07:51:25] <ch3mical> lulz
[07:51:28] <duttonstuart> hello
[07:51:42] <alexidoia> cyty: in that same function I am trying to getElementById() but it does not
[07:51:58] <alexidoia> is the content not being added to the dom ?
[07:52:17] <cyty> loadPage is not jQuery as far as I know
[07:52:26] <ch3mical> No, it's not
[07:52:45] <ch3mical> I might be a function that is using jquery though
[07:52:55] <Tumulte> How can I prevent animations to pause between 2 .animate?
[07:52:56] <ch3mical> We won't know without seeing some code
[07:52:56] <SeanLazer> alexidoia: are you calling getElementById in a success/complete callback of your ajax call?  or just immediately after starting the call?  it's possible that you're trying to access the element before it's loaded
[07:53:12] <ch3mical> Tumulte: see ?delay
[07:53:14] <janthony> If console.log returns [Window work] - how would I extract the "work" to a string?
[07:53:30] <ch3mical> http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[07:53:45] <duttonstuart> I have a bit of a challenge...  I am trying to use cloud zoom on another plugin which uses a variable #displayed img.  when the thumbnail is clicked the larger image is displayed but i want to get cloud-zoom to zoom whatever image is loaded into the wrapper..  I need help as really stuck.
[07:54:02] <alexidoia> SeanLazer: I use loadPage to add the content then customFunction to apply a fonction when it is loaded, in that function, I am trying to target the content I just added with getElementById
[07:54:12] <cyty> Tumulte: if you have two .animate, why don't you combine them?
[07:54:17] <SeanLazer> alexidoia: post the relevant code
[07:54:25] <SeanLazer> alexidoia: also are you even using jquery?
[07:54:31] <alexidoia> yes
[07:54:53] <ch3mical> bot-t where are you? T_T
[07:54:57] <Tumulte> cyty, combine??
[07:55:24] <ch3mical> Tumulte: he means "chain" not "combine" ... see http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[07:55:26] <Tumulte> i did (#object).animate(animation).animate(animation2)
[07:55:38] <Tumulte> (with lousy syntaxe
[07:55:38] <ch3mical> Tumulte: use delay (see above)
[07:55:49] <Tumulte> delay can be 0
[07:55:51] <Tumulte> then
[07:55:53] <alexidoia> SeanLazer: http://pastebin.com/RRBsQxFv
[07:55:54] <alexidoia> thanks
[07:56:01] <cyty> ch3mical: he wants to prevent the pause... so try #object.animate({animation, animation2}) ?
[07:56:33] <ch3mical> I thought he said create a pause
[07:56:57] <SeanLazer> alexidoia: what happens if you sub out document.getElementById for $('#x')
[07:56:58] <ch3mical> Oops
[07:57:23] <Tumulte> ch3mical, ;)
[07:57:35] <ch3mical> alexidoia: yeah, what happens if you actually use jquery? :P
[07:57:40] <[tasty]freeze> in mootools i was able to create dom objects by saying document.createElement('table'), and pass that into a function by reference so i could append more dom objects to the table, but i can't seem to find a way to do that in jquery
[07:57:42] <SeanLazer> alexidoia: also i think that you actually want to use "function() { hijackLinks(fun) }" as the third argument to your load call
[07:57:42] <[tasty]freeze> is it possible?
[07:58:06] <ch3mical> createElement is just standard JS
[07:58:09] <Tumulte> cyty I didn't know this syntax. Do you, per change, know where"s it's documented
[07:58:18] <[tasty]freeze> is appendChild as well?
[07:58:35] <[tasty]freeze> i was calling appendChild on my table object and i received an error
[07:58:37] <SeanLazer> [tasty]freeze: var table = $('<table />'), table.append('<tr><td>hello</td></tr>') ?
[07:59:03] <cyty> Tumulte: what are the properties you're trying to animate? as in, what is animation and what is animation2 ?
[07:59:22] <Tumulte> cyty,  movments rotations... css stuffs
[07:59:25] <Tumulte> opacity
[07:59:34] <cyty> Tumulte: basically you can call .animate({property:'value',property2:'value2',property3:'value3'});
[07:59:35] <[tasty]freeze> SeanLazer that's basically what I'm doing but i need to break it up into small functions and the code looks gross doing it that way
[07:59:48] <cyty> as with .css where you pass in multiple properties
[08:00:06] <topcat> How can I tell the difference between a click and a double click ?
[08:00:09] <SeanLazer> [tasty]freeze: if you pastie your code people might have suggestions on how to clean it up
[08:00:10] <ch3mical> [tasty]freeze: jsfiddle it
[08:00:11] <[tasty]freeze> i may need to change the style of a td later on down in the function
[08:00:16] <Tumulte> cyty, will they chain or be passed all at once?
[08:00:17] <ch3mical> topcat: dblclick
[08:00:18] <SeanLazer> topcat: a double click sounds like this "cli-click"
[08:00:23] <LYoung> my S3slider was working earlier, now the first image doesn't appear  (see http://www.webbuddies.co.za ) .... also, I have GalleryView, but I can't seem to get it working (thats on http://www.webbuddies.co.za/Portfolio/Default.aspx )
[08:00:31] <cyty> Tumulte: they will be all simultaneous
[08:00:42] <alexidoia> SeanLazer: actually, is it a bit more complicated, I have pasted the real code, I am trying to launch a function according to the name of the file the content is being extracted, and it is within that function that the getElementById does not work
[08:01:10] <janthony> If console.log($(this)) returns [Window partners] - how would I extract the "partners" text? I tried window.name / window.self, no luck.
[08:01:19] <SeanLazer> alexidoia: welp, if you're not actually going to use jQuery then this is a question for #javascript
[08:01:25] <LYoung> anyone got .... an hour at least ... to help ?
[08:01:34] <alexidoia> SeanLazer: I use it !
[08:01:34] <SeanLazer> document.getElementById is not in the domain of this channel
[08:01:45] <ch3mical> janthony: exactly what are you trying to do?
[08:01:45] <alexidoia> is it not ?
[08:01:51] <SeanLazer> use the jquery shorthand
[08:01:55] <SeanLazer> $('#statusMsg')
[08:02:06] <ch3mical> alexidoia: getElementById is not jQuery
[08:02:07] <janthony> ch3mical: use the the text I'm trying to extract as a reference point for a dom delement.
[08:02:08] <alexidoia> ok sure, but it does not work in my function
[08:02:29] <alexidoia> ch3mical: ok I did not know
[08:02:35] <SeanLazer> alexidoia: did you take my suggestion to wrap your third argument in a function call?
[08:02:42] <janthony> ch3mical: I know how to do that part, I just need to figure out how to extract that text from the window object that it's already returning with console.log
[08:02:57] <ch3mical> alexidoia: try #javascript for questions about getElementById
[08:03:00] <SeanLazer> alexidoia: .load(a, b, function() { hijackLinks(fun) });
[08:03:02] <pastie> SeanLazer: http://pastie.org/2067019 by [tasty]freeze.
[08:03:03] <cos_> hi... I'm using the ajax load method to fill a div with html. i've searched google but didn't find any useful hints on how to enable javascripts on the loaded html. explicitly i want to have anchor navigation on the html. any useful ideas?
[08:03:07] <alexidoia> SeanLazer: is it not what I have done in my new paste ?
[08:03:15] <topcat> ch3mical : well that was surprisingly easy. Is something like $div.click or dblclick{do this} - going to play nicely or will it run click for each click as well as the double?
[08:03:35] <SeanLazer> [tasty]freeze: woof!  you're on your own here!
[08:03:40] <SeanLazer> alexidoia: i didn't see your new paste
[08:04:18] <janthony> Any ideas?
[08:04:29] <[tasty]freeze> so basically: http://pastie.org/2067019
[08:04:55] <[tasty]freeze> line 49 takes a reference to the column so it can put the data in there.
[08:05:07] <ch3mical> topcat: dblclick and click are treated differently, click will only register if it's a single click (determined by your system's dblclick speed setting)
[08:05:09] <[tasty]freeze> also, i have a special case for updating the class name of a column.
[08:05:20] <[tasty]freeze> line 41.
[08:05:45] <Tumulte> cyty, mh... actually I want to chain them. But if I do "top:100px" then "top:200px". It will go to 100px;stops;then go to 200px
[08:05:50] <[tasty]freeze> i updated the code, the first paste was incorrect
[08:06:02] <Tumulte> cyty, I'd like to prevent that stop
[08:06:07] <janthony> n/m, figured it out. looks like window.location.href is what I was looking for.
[08:06:29] <cyty> Tumulte: so you want the 'top:200px' to be applied over a longer period of time? so a smooth animation?
[08:06:51] <ch3mical> [tasty]freeze: what am I looking for again?
[08:07:10] <cyty> Tumulte: use the second parameter of .animate, the duration :) maybe that helps you?
[08:07:11] <topcat> ch3mical : I've got a link to click to slide out a div. if someone double clicks it it will slide in/out faster than you will see. I'm trying to catch the double click and just slide out anyway. how might I do that
[08:07:46] <alexidoia> SeanLazer: I have done what you said but it worked the same before
[08:08:07] <[tasty]freeze> i'm trying to understand how to turn this code into something that works with jquery without making a mess... the main issue is mootools let me call document.createElement('tr') and manipulate attributes such as 'className' and then call 'table.append(row)'.  jquery doesn't seem to allow append(some dom object)
[08:08:10] <SeanLazer> alexidoia: are you sure you're actually outputting an element with id statusMsg
[08:08:16] <ch3mical> topcat: you should put in a check, if the element is not done sliding, don't do anything on the second click
[08:08:29] <[tasty]freeze> ch3mical which really messes my code up, unless i'm missing something
[08:08:37] <Tumulte> cyty, it's only an exemple to stress that there's a stop
[08:08:41] <ch3mical> jquery does
[08:08:42] <alexidoia> yes for sure, but as I said no in the function called after loadPage
[08:08:44] <topcat> ch3mical oh ok
[08:08:53] <ch3mical> [tasty]freeze: can we move to pm? too much activity in here lol
[08:08:55] <[tasty]freeze> ch3mical a good example is between 34-45
[08:09:09] <SeanLazer> [tasty]freeze: you totally can do that.  var tr = $('<tr />');  tr.addClass('fancy'); tr.css('position', 'absolute'); tr.appendTo('table');
[08:09:29] <SeanLazer> [tasty]freeze: or you can chain all those
[08:09:46] <alexidoia> SeanLazer: here http://pastebin.com/fn4SJw2d
[08:10:13] <ch3mical> [tasty]freeze: you're appending an element, not and object, that's why jquery works with objects
[08:10:43] <ch3mical> [tasty]freeze: change document.createElement('td') to $('<td/>')
[08:11:04] <alexidoia> SeanLazer: what do you think, can I do that ?
[08:11:46] <ch3mical> [tasty]freeze: createElement returns an element reference, $('<td/>') returns an object reference... .append expects and object
[08:11:49] <SeanLazer> alexidoia: this should work, something else is obviously not happening correctly
[08:11:52] <ch3mical> an*
[08:12:30] <iateadonut> O:-)vuifgnaomi
[08:17:23] <alexidoia> SeanLazer: ok it works, I manage to target the object, but now .appendChild('test'); don't seem to work, can I really work with it as with normal content ?
[08:17:47] <SeanLazer> alexidoia: yes, but if you're going to keep using non-jquery functions you should be using #javascript
[08:18:08] <alexidoia> SeanLazer: I am not aware of them all
[08:18:13] <SeanLazer> alexidoia: more time in the docs, less time in IRC
[08:18:29] <alexidoia> SeanLazer: ok i did not look
[08:18:54] <SeanLazer> alexidoia: IRC should be your last resort for help, docs first, then google, then here
[08:19:13] <SeanLazer> alexidoia: i don't mean to be rude, it's just the most effective way to solve problems
[08:21:08] <[tasty]freeze> thanks
[08:22:30] <VictorCl2> if I have var obj = { 123:"bla"; 322:"sds" } , is there a way to call a key directly .. like obj[123]  ?
[08:22:37] <VictorCl2> can I do that?
[08:23:10] <systemfault> Try it :)
[08:23:35] <Urthen> I've got a quick beginner question on writing modules that rely on jQuery: Is it always a reasonable assumption that $ will exist, or is there a safer best practice for access?
[08:23:50] <systemfault> VictorCl2: It works, you just have a syntax error
[08:24:23] <systemfault> VictorCl2: the seperator between the members of an object literal isn't ;
[08:24:30] <seutje> Urthen: (function($){ /* $ == jQuery in here */ })(jQuery);
[08:25:40] <mphill_> When I am using the slider for jquery UI if I specify a value of 100 or higher the slider value it is set to the max (the position of the slider handle). It seems to be treating the value as the slider percentage although the documentation says otherwise.
[08:26:23] <[tasty]freeze> how do i change/set the src attribute on an img object?
[08:26:36] <mphill_> I figured it out, nevermind.
[08:27:05] <[tasty]freeze> attr i'm guessing
[08:27:19] <[tasty]freeze> yay
[08:27:39] <Urthen> seutje: Thanks! I'll try that.

[08:38:40] <duttonstuart> I have a bit of a challenge...  I am trying to use cloud zoom on another plugin which uses a variable #displayed img.  when the thumbnail is clicked the larger image is displayed but i want to get cloud-zoom to zoom whatever image is loaded into the wrapper..  I need help as really stuck.
[08:39:21] <duttonstuart> I have code if someone could take a look .. I am using a jquery gallery and trying to tap into it using cloudzoon
[08:40:20] <duttonstuart> I thought I would be able to add a class to the #displayed imageWrapper but didnt seem to do anything
[08:40:42] <duttonstuart> can I show someone the url?
[08:41:06] <coleGillespie> sure i will have a look
[08:41:10] <duttonstuart> or could someone have a look at it for me..  I am sure its probably something easily sorted if you know how..
[08:41:13] <duttonstuart> ok cool thanks
[08:41:45] <duttonstuart> here is the URL..  http://www.chicfreakz.co.uk/opulencebride.html
[08:42:49] <duttonstuart> if posible I need to add cloud-zoom to the main image wrapper
[08:42:49] <coleGillespie> what does cloud zoom do?
[08:43:21] <duttonstuart> it zooms the image by either opening another box beside or doing a inner zoom  will send you the link
[08:43:43] <coleGillespie> ok
[08:43:50] <duttonstuart> http://www.professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom.htm
[08:45:00] <r3v3rb> hello
[08:45:27] <r3v3rb> is there a way i can calculate the height of two elements and store them in a variable?
[08:45:34] <duttonstuart> its a very good tool however it looks for hrefs and my var includes image sources not hrefs so I either need to have something interpret my image sources as hrefs or by some other means
[08:45:48] <r3v3rb> is it just var abc = element.height + element2.height
[08:46:51] <coleGillespie> duttonstuart: how are you handling your clicks on the thumgnaiks
[08:46:55] <coleGillespie> thumbnails*
[08:47:22] <coleGillespie> one way to do this is to add the class to the img inside of the images array
[08:47:28] <coleGillespie> kind of like you do the source
[08:48:48] <coleGillespie> or
[08:48:55] <coleGillespie> add a click handler to your images
[08:49:00] <coleGillespie> find the image that is being displayed
[08:49:04] <coleGillespie> then add the class that way
[08:51:03] <coleGillespie> basically you are adding the class at the wrong time
[08:51:08] <coleGillespie> do it when the thumbnail is clicked
[08:51:15] <coleGillespie> understand
[08:51:16] <coleGillespie> ?
[08:51:54] <defunct> can anyone recommend a plugin that can cycle through divs with different kinds of content using arrows or another kind of nav?
[08:52:09] <ryanneufeld> what you want is called a slider
[08:52:24] <ryanneufeld> and there are dozens on the internet
[08:52:28] <coleGillespie> jTools is good
[08:52:41] <ryanneufeld> ?lmgtfy jquery slider @defunct
[08:52:52] <tbranyen> jTools?
[08:52:55] <ryanneufeld> doh, no bot-t
[08:53:00] <coleGillespie> http://flowplayer.org/tools/index.html
[08:53:47] <defunct> thanks
[08:54:08] <r3v3rb> any reason this doesn't parse :
[08:54:09] <r3v3rb> 			var showMe = "#"+show[1];
[08:54:13] <r3v3rb> 			var newHeight = showMe.css('height');	
[08:54:23] <duttonstuart> thanks gillespie.. do understand but not sure how to do it
[08:54:56] <duttonstuart> where abouts in the code should I add it.. and what do I add..  I am kind of new to it all.. but getting there..
[08:59:51] <ryanneufeld> ?google jquery slider @defunct
[09:00:33] <antihero> What was that JS that allowed you to have fixed width layouts which then adapted to resizing the browser smaller?
[09:00:56] <Jon47> what an insane thing to make a plugin for..
[09:01:14] <systemfault> Wouldn't CSS just do the trick?
[09:01:22] <antihero> systemfault: Perhaps, how would I do that?
[09:01:28] <ajpiano> antihero http://filamentgroup.com/lab/respondjs_fast_css3_media_queries_for_internet_explorer_6_8_and_more/
[09:01:28] <duttonstuart> coleGillespie thanks for your response..  could you advise where and what I need to put in place?
[09:02:03] <systemfault> antihero: I'm not sure.. using min-width/max-width for example.
[09:02:38] <coleGillespie> yes, put your addclass call inside of your click handler for your thumbnail image
[09:02:45] <Jon47> oh i see, this script is basically a polyfill for min-width/max-width
[09:02:51] <antihero> systemfault: Ah that's an idea
[09:02:54] <cos_> can anyone fix my ajax load / anchors for 30$ ?
[09:03:17] <vanmik> what the point of writing code like that: $(function(){ $('selector').click(function(){ ... }); }); ?
[09:03:32] <eddiemonge> vanmik: what do you mean?
[09:03:39] <eddiemonge> cos_: whats wrong with them?
[09:04:02] <cos_> the anchor nav doesn't work right now
[09:04:09] <vanmik> eddiemonge: $(function(){...}); instead of just $('selector').click(function(){...});
[09:04:36] <cakehero> Does anyone know what a great way to generate a time zone drop down is?
[09:04:43] <eddiemonge> vanmik: its a convenience method for .ready()
[09:05:12] <cos_> eddie: the anchors don't work. will you take a look?
[09:05:34] <vanmik> eddiemonge: so, "$(function(){...});" it's the same as "$(document).ready(function(){...});" ?
[09:05:53] <antihero> max width is aweosme
[09:05:59] <eddiemonge> vanmik: yes
[09:06:07] <eddiemonge> cos_: sure
[09:06:10] <antihero> Can I set width then override it with max width for browsers that support?
[09:06:13] <vanmik> eddiemonge: now that make sense, thanks
[09:06:15] <eddiemonge> cakehero: check to see if google has an api
[09:06:31] <eddiemonge> antihero: i think if you set a width, min and max are ignored
[09:06:52] <cos_> eddie: I gave you the link
[09:07:06] <cakehero> eddiemonge interesting idea - I will
[09:07:26] <cakehero> eddiemonge you mean for geoip ?
[09:07:41] <eddiemonge> i dont know
[09:08:19] <duttonstuart> I am lost already..  sorry ColeGillespie..
[09:08:27] <cakehero> eddiemonge k
[09:08:51] <coleGillespie> duttonstuart: are you a webDev?
[09:09:14] <duttonstuart> do I put this insde the jquery gallery script or the script that I have created to tap in ..
[09:09:30] <coleGillespie> the one you created
[09:09:43] <duttonstuart> I am starting out.. yes..  I need some classes..
[09:09:59] <coleGillespie> i am busy at the moment. look at how click handlers work
[09:10:09] <coleGillespie> jquery click()
[09:10:17] <duttonstuart> 	$('#thumbsContainer img').live('click', function(e) {
[09:10:24] <coleGillespie> got it
[09:10:27] <jj_> I have created a mobile site using jquery mobile.  Running into a few problems with image loading.  Is there anyone who is willing to check out my code and let me know if they see a problem???
[09:10:29] <coleGillespie> i dunno what live is
[09:10:34] <coleGillespie> but ya, i think that is it
[09:10:42] <pandan> how do i style a sortable? :(
[09:11:12] <coleGillespie> add your cloud zoom add class code inside of there
[09:11:15] <coleGillespie> that should work
[09:12:05] <jj_> how do I handle on click image loading in JqueryMobile
[09:12:09] <jj_> ??
[09:13:04] <eddiemonge> on click image loading? you mean load an image when something is clicked?
[09:13:13] <jj_> yes
[09:14:03] <jj_> sorry if terminology is not correct.   new to scripting
[09:15:00] <jj_> example of what I am trying to do is at www.5starfinsh.com/tests/ColorChartMobile
[09:15:14] <jj_> sorry typo in url above
[09:15:34] <jj_> www.5starfinish.com/tests/ColorChartMobile
[09:16:22] <Segaja> hi, is the submit() method from jQuery the same as if i would use onsubmit() in normal JS?
[09:17:46] <GitNick> how do you make a plugin keep state? I have a plugin that needs to do an action the first time it is called, as well as when a particular element changes. This gist shows what I would like to do, but obviously fails due to function scope issues: https://gist.github.com/1025240
[09:17:55] <eddiemonge> Segaja: in theory yes
[09:19:12] <Segaja> eddiemonge: what means "in theory" ?
[09:19:27] <Segaja> i'm converting some old js code to jquery and have a form.onsubmit = function() {..}
[09:19:46] <Segaja> can i use $(form).submit(function() {...}); ?
[09:20:10] <eddiemonge> Segaja: why not just compare like this:   var $this = $(this);   if ( !$this.attr('src') ) { $this.attr('src', $this.data('src') ); }
[09:20:18] <eddiemonge> Segaja: yes
[09:20:42] <Segaja> thanks
[09:22:41] <GeO`> hey guys
[09:23:08] <GeO`> I have a jquery ui <button>, and I wanna make it draggable, but a simple $("#its_id").draggable(); doesn't work
[09:23:11] <GeO`> is it possible ?
[09:23:13] <odyniec> GitNick: you can attach the state-related data to the element using .data()
[09:25:21] <jj_> this is the script I am using to load an image when a collapsable is clicked. <script type="text/javascript">   function ClickCollapsable()     {   if (this.src != null && this.src.length > 0)      return;    $(this).attr("src", $(this).attr("data-src"));     }     $(document).ready(function()  {   var collaps = $("ul[class='ui-listview'] div[data-role='collapsible']");     collaps.each(function ()   {  $(this).children("h3").find("a").cli
[09:26:17] <jj_>  {                 var myImg = $(this).parent().parent().children("div").children().children("img")                 if (myImg.attr("src") > "")                     return;                 myImg.attr("src", myImg.attr("data-src"));             }         )});     });
[09:26:42] <eddiemonge> jj_: i know. did you see my message?
[09:26:44] <Kaapa> jj_: do you really think anyone will help you with that?
[09:27:02] <jj_> no eddiemonge
[09:27:02] <Kaapa> use pastebin / jsfiddle
[09:28:52] <eddiemonge> jj_: why not just compare like this:   var $this = $(this);   if ( !$this.attr('src') ) { $this.attr('src', $this.data('src') ); }
[09:29:03] <jj_> thanks
[09:29:09] <GitNick> thank you odyniec
[09:29:47] <odyniec> GitNick: np
[09:30:03] <cloudjumper> Hey, I'm trying to implement a very simple checkbox tree, where switching parent categories checks or unchecks all the child boxes. I can get the desired UI behaviour by handling changes on the top level input, #group_layer, with $('#layer_fields input').prop("checked", $('#group_layer').prop("checked"));, but I have .change() handlers set for each of the child boxes, and these do not fire. How should I best proceed?
[09:31:04] <eddiemonge> cloudjumper: trigger('change')?
[09:32:11] <cloudjumper> eddiemonge, doh! Thanks.
[09:32:40] <ch3mical> Hmmm
[09:33:18] <duttonstuart> hmm anyone else be able to help in getting cloud-zoom working with another script I have... ColeGillespie mentioned on click event but didnt seem to do anything..
[09:33:34] <coleGillespie> post link
[09:34:05] <coleGillespie> to the test case
[09:34:07] <coleGillespie> let me see what you did
[09:35:07] <duttonstuart> http://www.chicfreakz.co.uk/opulencebride.html
[09:35:25] <duttonstuart> probably wrong
[09:36:01] <duttonstuart> I tried thumbail img too but didnt make a difference.
[09:36:03] <ravenzz> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'onsubmit' of undefined
[09:36:05] <alexidoia> to remove the children of an element would you need to walk through them like in js ?
[09:36:48] <ravenzz> alexidoia i suppose that you can do something like $('#element').html("");
[09:37:15] <alexidoia> ravenzz: ouf thanks, and remove() ?
[09:37:23] <ajpiano> alexidoia, you can .empty() it
[09:37:48] <alexidoia> oh yes I hust saw that, thanks
[09:37:52] <ravenzz> or just use empty((
[09:37:57] <ravenzz>  empty()
[09:38:01] <ch3mical> Can .push be used with JSON objects? To add to the JSON, that is
[09:38:37] <JKarsrud> ch3mical: if it's an array you can push all you want
[09:38:45] <JKarsrud> afaik
[09:38:47] <ch3mical> It's JSON
[09:38:55] <ravenzz> alexidoia remove() remove the matched element
[09:39:03] <alexidoia> ok thanks
[09:39:17] <ch3mical> Not sure if JS sees that as an "array"
[09:39:30] <coleGillespie> duttonstuart: what browser are you using?
[09:39:30] <JKarsrud> ch3mical: doesn't matter, if it's an array in the json you can push to it
[09:39:56] <JKarsrud> ch3mical: http://benalman.com/news/2010/03/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-json/
[09:39:59] <JKarsrud> read that :)
[09:40:10] <duttonstuart> Cross browsing.. so iE8 IE9 and Firefox
[09:40:19] <JKarsrud> I'm going out for a 30 minute run, if you still have questions then, I'll try to answer them then :)
[09:40:22] <coleGillespie> what are you testing with?
[09:40:37] <ch3mical> Ok, I have basically, { catalog1: { metadata1: value, metadata2: value ... metadataX: value }, catalog2: { ... } }
[09:40:38] <duttonstuart> I have opened that in Chrome sorry
[09:40:41] <ch3mical> I think that's right
[09:40:50] <coleGillespie> do you know how to use the web inspector?
[09:41:01] <ch3mical> Is that what you mean by it being an array?
[09:41:10] <duttonstuart> what to inspect the elements?
[09:41:44] <coleGillespie> yes
[09:41:49] <coleGillespie> you have a javascript erro
[09:41:51] <coleGillespie> r
[09:41:53] <coleGillespie> look at the console
[09:41:57] <coleGillespie> in the web inspector in chrome
[09:41:59] <coleGillespie> fix that error
[09:42:12] <coleGillespie> it might be breaking your other javascript
[09:42:30] <JKarsrud> ch3mical: try it and see, I'm back in 30-40 minutes
[09:42:45] <ch3mical> jkarsrud thanks for the link, I guess it's not JSON ;p
[09:42:57] <duttonstuart> thats a php form problem isnt it?
[09:42:58] <mbroadst> hey, I've got a piece of code that returns an array of arrays ([ [1,2,3], [4,5,6] ]) which is the result of dumping a python array to "json". While that's not exactly json, I thought that the parser for $.ajax with dataType json would be able to handle it, but it seems like it can't. anyone have any ideas on how to get around this?
[09:43:07] <ch3mical> An object literal, then
[09:43:24] <coleGillespie> no, it is a javascript problem
[09:43:26] <geekbuntu> *raises hand - that not an array of lists?
[09:43:44] <mbroadst> geekbuntu: right, sorry
[09:44:03] <geekbuntu> mbroadst, wasn't trying to be right - just trying to keep all these freaking languages straight in my head
[09:44:07] <eddiemonge> ben_alman: can named anchors work with your bbq plugin and related stuff?  cc cos_
[09:44:08] <mbroadst> :)
[09:44:11] <mbroadst> me too apparently
[09:44:31] <coleGillespie> do you see the javascript problem duttonstuart?
[09:44:36] <ch3mical> Ok, so to ask my question properly. can .push be used on Object Literals?
[09:45:14] <ch3mical> Probably not, now that I think about it
[09:45:39] <alexidoia> I use to do this to add a script in the head of my document and run it, but I am not sure it works in jquery : script.src = "http://ws.geonames.org/findNearbyPostalCodesJSON?lat=" + latitude + "&lng=" + longitude + "&callback=" + callback;
[09:45:43] <alexidoia> 		// Run the Script
[09:45:46] <alexidoia> 		document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(script);
[09:45:51] <geekbuntu> ch3mical, ironically, it would make sense (logically) that it could be used with .push... gonna go look
[09:46:05] <LYoung> is there any real benefit to using flash over jquery for presentational purposes?
[09:46:08] <ch3mical> You would think, right? But I dunno
[09:46:16] <geekbuntu> it's an object
[09:46:33] <duttonstuart> ok fixed that problem
[09:46:43] <geekbuntu> the only thing you might have to do to de-json-ize it is strip the outter layer variable_name[0]
[09:46:50] <duttonstuart> was just a clear form function not working properly
[09:47:33] <eddiemonge> LYoung: benefit?
[09:48:20] <ch3mical> geekbuntu: well it's not actually JSON, I misused that term by mistake
[09:49:04] <LYoung> eddiemonge : like... what would I get out of using flash for a slideshow that jquery wouldn't deliver faster?
[09:49:27] <djQuery> morn
[09:49:51] <CESDave> Anyone got time to help me answer a slightly in-depth question about live triggers?

[09:50:34] <coleGillespie> duttonstuart: wrap all of your custom javascript in a document ready function
[09:50:48] <geekbuntu> ch3mical, is it an object then?
[09:50:53] <ch3mical> geekbuntu: yes
[09:50:59] <duttonstuart> will do
[09:51:02] <coleGillespie> duttonstuart: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[09:51:32] <ch3mical> geekbuntu: nested objects, also
[09:51:35] <djQuery> ch3mical: if the object has an array in it then .push should be able to be used on that
[09:51:38] <CESDave> Alrighty, I've got something weird happening with a live trigger.  I set it up using this kind of syntax: $("input", "#m_login").live("click", function () {blah blah});
[09:51:55] <CESDave> The element then gets removed: $("#m_login")
[09:52:04] <LYoung> eddiemonge: I don't but clients do
[09:52:04] <CESDave> The element then gets removed: $("#m_login").remove() rather
[09:52:13] <LYoung> personally I can't stand flash
[09:52:17] <LYoung> I much prefer jquery
[09:52:49] <CESDave> Then, it gets created again later and the trigger set up with the same syntax.  I'm finding that the old trigger didn't get deleted with $("#m_login").remove()
[09:53:14] <CESDave> Is this a bug?  Shouldn't live triggers set up with a context get removed when that context gets removed?
[09:53:18] <djQuery> CESDave: yes that is expected behavior.
[09:53:24] <ch3mical> My object would be something like { catalog1: { metadata1: value, metadata2: value ... metadataX: value }, catalog2: { ... } }
[09:53:24] <eddiemonge> LYoung: no they dont. they think they do because someone hasnt straightened them out yet
[09:53:25] <LYoung> for one thing I suppose delivery time can be drastically reduced by using jquery as opposed to flash since it's easier to deploy
[09:53:29] <alexidoia> is it normal that the homepage of jQuery PlacePicker does not work or it is me ?
[09:53:31] <alexidoia> http://nickspacek.github.com/jQuery-PlacePicker/
[09:53:38] <LYoung> LOL eddiemonge, well said :)
[09:53:47] <djQuery> CESDave: you now have 2 click trigers on it
[09:53:47] <eddiemonge> CESDave: .die()
[09:54:09] <CESDave> I know about die, but shouldn't live triggers get removed when their context is removed?
[09:54:10] <eddiemonge> CESDave: live isnt bound to the element. its bound to the document which looks for that element
[09:54:13] <CESDave> Yes I have 2 click triggers.
[09:54:14] <alexidoia> is there any tutorial to use reverseGeoconding with jQuery ?
[09:54:53] <CESDave> eddiemonge: even when a context is specified?
[09:54:56] <geekbuntu> ch3mical, follow the comments by wolf - looks like push can be used o.0|   http://old.nabble.com/how-to-add-elements-to-a-jQuery-object-without-copying-it-td19635526s27240.html
[09:54:58] <mbroadst> well, I've been able to convert my response to: " [ {"id":1, "name":2}, {"id":2, "name":3} ]" and that still gives me a parse error. can anyone shed light on this?
[09:55:00] <coleGillespie> duttonstuart: add }); to the end right before </script>
[09:55:18] <geekbuntu> mbroadst, did you have a paste originally?
[09:55:23] <eddiemonge> mbroadst: whats the problem?
[09:55:40] <mbroadst> the problem is the $.ajax call with dataType json causes a parse error
[09:55:43] <djQuery> ch3mical: if you made  [catalog1: { metadata1: value, metadata2: value ... metadataX: value }, catalog2: { ... } ].push({metadata1: 33333, etc...})
[09:55:43] <CESDave> djQuery: but shouldn't the live trigger be removed when the context that was used to set it up gets deleted?
[09:55:51] <eddiemonge> mbroadst: link?
[09:55:58] <geekbuntu> mbroadst, did you test the json?
[09:56:06] <geekbuntu> (json lint)
[09:56:08] <eddiemonge> CESDave: did you read what i wrote?
[09:56:24] <mbroadst> oh no I haven't, that's a great resource
[09:56:38] <geekbuntu> djQuery, nice... that very close to what they did in the link i found
[09:56:43] <CESDave> eddiemonge: yes, I did.  I heard somewhere that live triggers have to be recreated when the context they were set up with gets deleted.  Was this simply not true?
[09:57:15] <mbroadst> geekbuntu: it says "Valid JSON"
[09:57:33] <djQuery> CESDave: well if you didn this   $('#m_login').delegate('input', 'click', function(){}).remove(true);
[09:57:34] <mbroadst> geekbuntu, eddiemonge: one sec let me pastebin
[09:57:39] <geekbuntu> mbroadst, ty
[09:57:40] <eddiemonge> CESDave: not true. like i said, they are tied to the document, not to elements
[09:58:36] <djQuery> CESDave: forget about the true I had in that
[09:58:44] <CESDave> djQuery: alright
[09:58:58] <duttonstuart> i did.. its seems to have broken it..
[09:58:59] <coleGillespie> duttonstuart: wanna give me access to your server? i will fix it
[09:59:13] <duttonstuart> ok I will ..
[09:59:18] <CESDave> eddiemonge: Mkay, thanks for your answer.
[09:59:31] <coleGillespie> duttonstuart: is this for a client?
[09:59:42] <coleGillespie> duttonstuart: mcg42387@gmail.com
[09:59:43] <mbroadst> geekbuntu, eddiemonge: here is the raw output of the django page (the json that's output) http://pastebin.com/PM1pE4QA, and here is the jquery that I'm trying to use for autocomplete: http://pastebin.com/p51CY5Rr
[09:59:57] <duttonstuart> yes, well more of a family friend really
[10:01:02] <djQuery> mbroadst: try pasting your django\json at jsonlint and clicking on validate.
[10:01:25] <coleGillespie> duttonstuart: undo the document ready change
[10:01:26] <mbroadst> djQuery: yeah, I just did that when geekbuntu suggested, the result said "Valid JSON"
[10:01:33] <coleGillespie> duttonstuart: i think i might know the issue
[10:01:38] <duttonstuart> ok cool
[10:01:54] <djQuery> mbroadst: I got an error when I didnt it
[10:02:20] <mbroadst> oh, now I see that.. maybe thats from the pastebin
[10:02:24] <mbroadst> are you getting invalid array length?
[10:02:37] <duttonstuart> ok back to where it was
[10:02:46] <geekbuntu> mbroadst, djQuery rode me about testing json via lint for so long - it's automatic now when i have a json problem
[10:02:48] <BMCouto> Doesn't jQuery UI allow to set a background-color to transparent (or rgba) without having to trick it with an extra div to fade it?
[10:02:50] <djQuery> mbroadst: looks like I just didnt get all of it
[10:03:05] <mbroadst> djQuery: yeah sorry that was a dumb pastebin for that, huge result set
[10:03:13] <duttonstuart> I think the problem lies in I am trying to mix two plugins..
[10:03:26] <duttonstuart> and its conflicting.
[10:03:37] <eddiemonge> mbroadst: dont you have a live link for this?
[10:03:41] <geekbuntu> mbroadst, have you tested through each piece of your ajax ?   printed to console make sure your query (q:) is getting the correct value?
[10:03:57] <geekbuntu> see if anything is effecting the output from the function
[10:04:10] <CESDave> Okay, here's another question.  I have looked around for this and could not find a satisfactory explanation.  What is the real difference between live and delegate.  How do they differ in terms of their internal functions?
[10:04:12] <geekbuntu> eddiemonge, he pasted it above
[10:04:30] <KWhat_Work> what was that site where i can evaluate some javascript for debugging
[10:04:33] <duttonstuart> got the images to work fine.. and had to do that to append the information into the box beside the images.. but I would really like to gt the inner zoom working on the image wapper / displayed.
[10:04:35] <KWhat_Work> never mind
[10:04:36] <mbroadst> geekbuntu: yeah when I take out the datatype tag it returns as just text, and if I alert(data) from success at that point I'm getting that JSON result
[10:04:57] <geekbuntu> is the alerted json result correct? (on the screen)?
[10:05:06] <geekbuntu> mbroadst, look up ^^
[10:05:06] <duttonstuart> do you still want me to provide access to the file
[10:05:09] <mbroadst> I guess maybe I could try jquery.parseJSON in the alert given just text nd see if that works
[10:05:25] <duttonstuart> I really appreciate this by the way..
[10:05:28] <CESDave> I know it's a general question, but does anyone have some input?
[10:05:38] <mbroadst> let me check
[10:05:45] <eddiemonge> geekbuntu: no, i want a live link to see it happening in action cc mbroadst
[10:05:46] <geekbuntu> mbroadst, there were two links - only one worked
[10:05:53] <geekbuntu> ah
[10:05:54] <geekbuntu> kk
[10:06:06] <coleGillespie> duttonstuart: i will need access to all the files that go with the app
[10:06:12] <coleGillespie> including the plugins
[10:06:15] <duttonstuart> ok ta..
[10:06:16] <djQuery> mbroadst: that looks like it should work. hmmm you know request has a term right?   so data: { request.term }
[10:06:16] <djQuery>                     },
[10:06:29] <geekbuntu> & your tax returns for the last 3 years
[10:06:30] <geekbuntu> o.0
[10:06:35] <eddiemonge> CESDave: live attaches to the document. delegate attaches to whatever you want. live uses delegate internally and this delegate is faster
[10:07:29] <LYoung> http://www.webbuddies.co.za/Portfolio/Default.aspx             <<< the gallery worked until I uploaded it.. now it doesn't cycle images
[10:07:31] <geekbuntu> CESDave, don't know if it helps, but i thhnk of live as bind on steroids
[10:07:42] <orolo> array help please: tagarray = [foo: true, far: false]; i need to log out the value of true?
[10:07:56] <orolo> tagarray[foo]?
[10:08:41] <BMCouto> Doesn't jQuery UI allow to set a background-color to transparent (or rgba) without having to trick it with an extra div to fade it?
[10:09:07] <djQuery> CESDave: and if you google for jquery live vs bind you find lotsa articles and even a couple speed tests. .delegate always wins
[10:10:01] <mbroadst> geekbuntu: yeah looks like the response is exactly the same
[10:10:16] <eddiemonge> LYoung: 404 on the loader.gif
[10:10:26] <mbroadst> all I can think of is that maybe because the field headers are in quotes maybe its tripping the json parser in jquery?
[10:11:05] <geekbuntu> LYoung, your css is not mapped correctly
[10:11:08] <geekbuntu> check your paths
[10:11:11] <mbroadst> the second line of the error is mysterious to me as well
[10:11:20] <mbroadst> I get "parsererror" and then "jQuery15105259824427618146_1308071442773 was not called"
[10:12:05] <eddiemonge> mbroadst: are you doing jsonp? whats the url?
[10:12:23] <geekbuntu> mbroadst, i ate to ask - it's a pain in the arse to paste things - but can you put the function in paste as well?
[10:12:33] <djQuery> mbroadst: should your return be something like this ? return { label: item.first_name + ' ' + item.last_name,value: item.id}
[10:12:39] <geekbuntu> mbroadst, looks lke someone else has the asme hunch i do - jsonp/crossdoamin?
[10:13:15] <LYoung> haha I put the loader.gif in where it should be and it works :)
[10:13:36] <geekbuntu> LYoung, if you ask for help in jquery - at least include the jquery library :-D
[10:14:13] <LYoung> lol
[10:14:19] <LYoung> 1.4.2 I believe
[10:15:03] <JonnieCache> hi
[10:15:04] <CESDave> eddiemonge, djQuery, geekbuntu: Okay, I'll spend a bit more time on google and see if I can get a clearer picture.  I had tried to look around before but just couldn't find anything that seemed to have a clear, objective comparison.  Thanks for you answers again!
[10:15:57] <geekbuntu> CESDave, good luck
[10:16:28] <jami> is http://view.jquery.com/tags/1.3.2/test/ the best place to run the jquery test suite?
[10:19:04] <eddiemonge> jami: why such an old version. and the best place is a local checkout
[10:19:20] <djQuery> CESDave: http://www.alfajango.com/blog/the-difference-between-jquerys-bind-live-and-delegate/
[10:19:35] <jami> eddiemonge: yeah, that's just where a google search linked to. I have to setup a httpd to test locally?
[10:20:06] <jami> eddiemonge: trying to patch a small bug in ajax.js
[10:22:24] <shesek_>   
[10:23:46] <eddiemonge> jami: no, you dont but its easy to setup a web server. are you on windows?
[10:24:20] <jami> eddiemonge: osx, I can point apache at my local git working copy
[10:24:35] <jami> eddiemonge: just wanted to get a baseline set of results from jquery.com if it were available hosted
[10:25:29] <JonnieCache> I'm having terrible problems with deferreds. ive got a race condition.
[10:25:33] <JonnieCache> here's my code: http://www.privatepaste.com/be63d2fcc2
[10:26:00] <JonnieCache> inside the when(), on line 55, sets is logged to the console, eveyrthings as it should be
[10:26:13] <JonnieCache> however the for() loop doesnt run over sets
[10:26:34] <JonnieCache> except when I use a debugger, I assume this is because the delay introduced changes the race condition
[10:26:36] <duttonstuart> ColeGillespie..  just sent you the files..
[10:26:37] <JonnieCache> can anyone help?
[10:26:46] <duttonstuart> an the html
[10:28:08] <JKarsrud> ch3mical: did you figure it out? :)
[10:28:28] <ch3mical> jkarsrud got derailed by meetings, going to have to look at it later
[10:28:48] <ch3mical> brb
[10:30:48] <funnylookinhat> Is there a jQ equivalent for onbeforeunload ....  I know that I can do $(window).unload() , but I need onbeforeunload ... and would prefer to keep it all jQuery centric instead of adding window.onbeforeunload = myFunc();
[10:30:55] <duttonstuart> I have colegillespie looking at some code for me..  can anyone help with just another little issue..   I have a modal box that opens up an Iframe with a form in it.  when submitted this goes to a thankyou page which is shown in the same box for some reason when i close the box though it and reopen it stays on the thank you window.. Can I get rid of or clear this?  Will send on example if required.
[10:31:12] <eddiemonge> funnylookinhat: you can use .bind()
[10:31:27] <funnylookinhat> Ah right.
[10:31:36] <eddiemonge> duttonstuart: do .remove() on the contentts
[10:31:42] <funnylookinhat> eddiemonge, $(window).bind('onbeforeunload',function() { } );   // right?
[10:31:49] <eddiemonge> funnylookinhat: sure
[10:32:30] <duttonstuart> hi eddiemonge.. how do I do that..
[10:32:56] <duttonstuart> can I show you the code for the thank you php.. or do I do this in the element that calls the modal box
[10:33:29] <eddiemonge> duttonstuart: in the modal close just call .remove() on the iframe
[10:34:01] <JKarsrud> ch3mical: aight
[10:34:13] <jami> eddiemonge: ok, got the test suite working. hadn't updated the submodules so qunit was missing
[10:34:21] <jami> eddiemonge: are you a commiter?
[10:34:44] <eddiemonge> jami: not for core
[10:35:30] <JonnieCache> aaargh i found my answer. $.when() doesnt accept an array of promises, only multiple arguements. so i had to $.when.apply(this, array)
[10:36:42] <eddiemonge> jami: look in #jquery-dev
[10:36:49] <duttonstuart> I am using the modal for various items though.. will it not clear everything..  Or can I just do it on one case.. ?
[10:37:45] <eddiemonge> duttonstuart: you should be opening the modal with different content inside or using different ones for it
[10:38:17] <duttonstuart> i am using jquery.reveal.js
[10:38:38] <duttonstuart> yes i am opening it with diffent content inside..
[10:38:47] <duttonstuart> can I send url so you can see what I mean ?
[10:41:11] <bjensen> does anyone have any recommendations as to what right click context menu plugin to use? Ive only been able to find this: http://www.javascripttoolbox.com/lib/contextmenu/
[10:41:18] <JKarsrud> duttonstuart: what seems to be the problem? :)
[10:41:45] <duttonstuart> EddieMonge: please see http://www.chicfreakz.co.uk/opulencebride.html and click on "click here to enquire about this item..  do a quick contact page and submit.. you should get a thank you page but then if you do the same the info remains.. the thank you page is stuck in place.
[10:42:00] <RobW> hey guys, I have 4 dimensions.. WINDOW WxH and IMG WxH.. how can I calculate the images' size based on browser dimensions so that the image fits without scrollbars?
[10:42:06] <shogo> hi
[10:42:12] <duttonstuart> JKarsrud see above..  I am sure this will be a quick thing to sort
[10:42:57] <r3v3rb> hello
[10:43:13] <duttonstuart> I want to be able to clear the form back to its original state so that without a refresh it starts as a clear form and away from the thank you page when a new modal box is opened..
[10:43:39] <shogo> i'm new to jquery and have a question, i've a string of parameters (compted with $.param) and would like to call a php page in post mode with these arguments, but not make an AJAX call (wih $.post) but actuellay *go* to the page, thx for any help !
[10:44:24] <duttonstuart> I also want to know if its possible to pass the name from the form into the thankyou page..  ?
[10:45:56] <JKarsrud> duttonstuart: well, if you reload the iframe the next time you open the modal, it should pop into the original iframe, right?
[10:46:34] <duttonstuart> hopefully.. how would I do this?
[10:47:12] <roger_padactor> for live() to work does a base case have to already exist?
[10:47:24] <plov> $('#image').fadeOut('fast', function() { $('#image').attr('src', 'http://blah'); }); doesn't work?
[10:47:43] <plov> i want it to change src attribute when it completely fades out
[10:47:50] <JKarsrud> duttonstuart: I've never seen the jquery.reveal-plugin, could you link to it?
[10:48:35] <raulagrait_> is this an appropriate place for jqm questions? there didn't seem to be any conversation in #jquerymobile
[10:48:47] <duttonstuart> http://www.zurb.com/playground/reveal-modal-plugin
[10:49:46] <JKarsrud> duttonstuart: and how is your markup?
[10:49:51] <JKarsrud> for the iframe?
[10:50:02] <duttonstuart> ah sorry
[10:50:09] <JKarsrud> do you just do something like $('iframe').reveal()?
[10:50:15] <JKarsrud> could you make a jsfiddle?
[10:50:35] <JKarsrud> and you're using an iframe :)
[10:50:39] <JKarsrud> ?jsfiddle
[10:51:08] <duttonstuart> http://www.chicfreakz.co.uk/opulencebride.html  and click "click here to enquire about this item"
[10:52:08] <roger_padactor> say im adding an element to a div that will have a click function but no element exists before the element being added. How should I add a click event to that element so Im not always running the same code? Live() looked like it would work but an elm with the click event already has to exist.
[10:52:12] <JKarsrud> RobW: what if you make the image absolutely positioned or something, and set a width to less than the windows width using % ?
[10:52:48] <duttonstuart> yes.. using an ifram :S
[10:52:51] <duttonstuart> e
[10:52:52] <RobW> JKarsrud: it's within a container that has to have set widths/height for a slider
[10:53:35] <duttonstuart> in know, certainly no the best solution but it was the easiest way to get the php form into the reveal modal
[10:55:10] <RobW> see: http://tinyurl.com/3e68bum - can't seem to get it just right
[10:55:14] <JKarsrud> duttonstuart: something is seriously messed up with your markup
[10:55:16] <JKarsrud> somehere
[10:55:18] <JKarsrud> somewhere
[10:55:35] <duttonstuart> where?
[10:56:57] <duttonstuart> I am just starting the modal in jquery and then pulling it in as a class on the items I want to reveal..
[10:56:57] <JKarsrud> duttonstuart: never mind, just looked messed up
[10:57:09] <duttonstuart> ah.. I know,, needs tidying .  a lot
[10:58:15] <JKarsrud> duttonstuart: hmm, where do you start your modal? I can't seem to find it
[10:59:16] <lrvick> http://alpha.tawlk.com/#bitcoin if you click on a video on the right hand side, it pops up and plays ina  dialog, but if you close it the audio keeps playing. closing it does not destroy the dialog
[10:59:19] <lrvick> ideas?
[10:59:42] <duttonstuart> line 739
[10:59:57] <duttonstuart> <script src="reveal/jquery.reveal.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[11:00:01] <JKarsrud> which script?
[11:00:13] <JKarsrud> yes, that's where you include it, but where is it called?
[11:00:25] <JKarsrud> where do you do $().reveal()?
[11:01:24] <JKarsrud> or does it do that automagically when it finds something with reveal on it?
[11:01:51] <r3v3rb> anyone able to tell me why my click event is running twice on the second or third time of clicking on an item here http://jsfiddle.net/jfcRR/
[11:02:10] <JKarsrud> ahh, yes, it seems it does something magical there
[11:02:42] <duttonstuart> it does it by magic.. yes..
[11:02:59] <duttonstuart> its part of the reveal script... it calls iteself when it finds a named class
[11:03:46] <JKarsrud> yeah, I saw that now after looking at the source
[11:03:54] <duttonstuart> sorry
[11:04:16] <JKarsrud> no worries :)
[11:04:38] <JKarsrud> I'm still wondering how it sets it's source to be iframe tho
[11:04:51] <duttonstuart> I do that sorry
[11:05:03] <duttonstuart> its just for this particular form
[11:05:24] <JKarsrud> yes, but where? I can't seem to find it?
[11:05:34] <JKarsrud> oh wait
[11:05:36] <JKarsrud> lol
[11:05:36] <JKarsrud> :P
[11:05:39] <JKarsrud> I see it now :D
[11:05:42] <duttonstuart> <div id="contact" class="reveal-modal">
[11:05:59] <JKarsrud> need to read the docs :D
[11:06:07] <djQuery> .seen irvick
[11:06:08] <hsbot> djQuery: I have never seen irvick.
[11:06:37] <JKarsrud> duttonstuart: what you could do is bind to the "modal:open" event that it exposes
[11:06:42] <ohcibi> hi, is there a way to get the date of 10 days from now?
[11:06:47] <djQuery> lrvick: you need to bind something to the close on the dialog then go ahead and destroy the dialog
[11:06:47] <JKarsrud> or at least see if you can access it :)

[11:09:28] <multipass> hi, can anyone help with this syntax? I get 'unterminated string literal' $('.commentwrap').html("<div id='fb-root'></div><script src='http://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1'></script><fb:comments href='google.com' num_posts='10' width='465'></fb:comments>");
[11:09:38] <RobW> Can anyone help with this: http://tinyurl.com/3e68bum - I have it resizing width/height based on the browsers dimensions, but I don't want scroll bars and I don't care if there's white space on the sides of the image, I just want it contained. Ideas?
[11:10:01] <duttonstuart> possibly this then var closeButton = $('.' + options.dismissmodalclass).bind('click.modalEvent',closeModal)
[11:10:10] <RobW> multipass: switch out ' for " and vicevursa
[11:10:18] <duttonstuart> could I do something here?
[11:10:37] <multipass> RobW: i had it like that to begin with, and this is where i left off
[11:11:06] <Raverix> Switching out ' for " won't help.
[11:11:08] <Raverix> One moment.
[11:11:37] <duttonstuart> so that when I press the close button on the modal it clears the data?  but then when you click on the modal reveal again it will pull the data in the markup
[11:11:59] <RobW> weird
[11:12:00] <lrvick> djQuery:   close: function(ev, ui) {
[11:12:02] <lrvick>     $(this).remove();
[11:12:04] <lrvick>  that works
[11:12:11] <lrvick> woo
[11:12:23] <djQuery>  lrvick: yah something like that
[11:13:00] <djQuery>  lrvick but this would be better   $(this).dialog('destroy');
[11:13:40] <jami> eddiemonge: ok, fixed the problem.
[11:13:50] <jami> eddiemonge: do you know anyone who could code review a change to ajax.js?
[11:14:11] <Raverix> multipass: That line of code works.
[11:14:14] <Raverix> There's nothing wrong with it.
[11:14:17] <lrvick>  close: function(ev,ui){$(this).dialog('destroy');} ?
[11:14:24] <djQuery> jami: post to jquery-dev
[11:14:27] <Raverix> Check around that line in yoru code.
[11:14:30] <eddiemonge> jami: like i said, ask in #jquery-dev  submit a pull request and a bug for it
[11:14:35] <jami> djQuery: ok, thanks.
[11:14:42] <jami> eddiemonge: sorry, missed that - thanks.
[11:14:55] <multipass> Raverix: ok, hmm i copy pasted.. let me look around
[11:15:05] <RobW> http://jsfiddle.net/andV7/1/
[11:15:23] <RobW> I don't want scrollbars - (ignore vertical scroll bar as there's some extra padding)
[11:15:38] <RobW> basically, i want that image to fit the width and the height
[11:15:41] <RobW> but maintain aspect ratio
[11:16:12] <djQuery> RobW: you need to wait for the image to be loaded fully before you can get height and width one it
[11:16:54] <r3v3rb> djQuery any idea on my fiddle?
[11:17:16] <r3v3rb> http://jsfiddle.net/jfcRR/
[11:17:16] <djQuery> no it has gone past my buffer i think
[11:17:19] <RobW> djQuery: that's not the problem - i know that
[11:17:26] <bperry> hi, I am trying to make this go vertical, but I am not able to get the desired results
[11:17:29] <bperry> http://valums.com/scroll-menu-jquery/
[11:17:38] <bperry> has anyone implemented a version of that vertical on the web?
[11:17:39] <r3v3rb> why on the second or third click of an item does the animation run twice
[11:17:56] <devinrolsen> animation build up?
[11:18:06] <djQuery> RobW: well it was on my machine as your script ran immediatly and the image was still doing that 1980's thing of showing
[11:18:21] <djQuery> r3
[11:18:24] <tarzeau> where could i get paid jquery help in switzerland?
[11:18:29] <djQuery> r3v3rb: whats wrong with it?
[11:18:47] <r3v3rb> if you click an item, then something else then the original
[11:18:55] <djQuery> tarzeau: well I know where you can get paid jquery help right here
[11:18:56] <r3v3rb> the second time it repeats the fadein
[11:19:07] <tarzeau> djQuery: i don't have a credit card, that's the problem
[11:19:20] <devinrolsen> r3v3rb, try adding .stop() before you call .animate()
[11:19:41] <cos_> ben alman: are you here `?
[11:19:41] <tarzeau> djQuery: someone special in here, or just post the question/problem?
[11:19:44] <r3v3rb> devinrolsen, but the animate is the height of the container thats not the issue
[11:19:53] <r3v3rb> its the fadein
[11:20:20] <devinrolsen> ahh
[11:20:23] <r3v3rb> i think its to do with the adding/removing of class names
[11:20:33] <djQuery> well u can ask in here or you can send me some bit coin and ask me in a pm its up to you
[11:20:37] <r3v3rb> its sees .shown more than once so repeats
[11:21:09] <djQuery> r3v3rb: and your positive that it will always be the 2 class?
[11:21:16] <r3v3rb> yes
[11:21:37] <djQuery> and you need to cache $(shown);
[11:21:47] <r3v3rb> showMe is built from the requesting click
[11:21:58] <djQuery> var showMe = "#"+show[1];    instead   var showMe = $("#"+show[1]);
[11:22:51] <djQuery> then you can get rid of all the $(showMe).whatever and just do showMe.whatever
[11:23:15] <GeO`> what is the best way to preload images ?

[11:26:16] <ekkis> how do I add an image to jsfiddle?
[11:26:43] <r3v3rb> added a removeClass straight after the var declaration so it didn't get the old 'shown' class in the fadein
[11:27:17] <humbug> q
[11:27:42] <r3v3rb> thanks djQuery, is that the best practice for jQuery to pass it into the var as an object
[11:28:10] <KWhat_Work> inside a listener callback what does $(this) refer to?
[11:29:01] <mykul> usually the event target element

[11:30:21] <GeO`> what is the best way to preload images ?
[11:30:29] <mbroadst> geekbuntu: seems like I'm a bit stuck using an old version of jquery (1.4.2) could that be the problem?
[11:30:49] <GeO`> taking into account that I don't need to append them to the DOM once loaded, the user does it himself
[11:31:10] <GeO`> I mean, he got an arrow to go right, and it loads 1.png, 2.png and so on...
[11:31:17] <tarzeau> djQuery: could i pay you with apple iphone shop points?

[11:48:52] <eddiemonge> saimon69: hide it before you do the $.ajax part and then show it again in the success callback
[11:49:07] <KWhat_Work> What does $(this) refer to in: http://pastebin.com/knsCihMa
[11:49:16] <eddiemonge> byteme_: not a problem. just bind to the id of the submit
[11:49:33] <eddiemonge> KWhat_Work: $(document)
[11:50:32] <m0sphere> http://jsfiddle.net/afktp/ why doesn't this hide the 2 last div's, and if you change 5 to 3, it hides all of them?
[11:51:05] <byteme_> lol they're named the same
[11:51:20] <saimon69> the success is clear, what is the callback for before ajax that i forgot?

[12:20:54] <djQuery> eddiemonge: like that, gj
[12:21:53] <ryrych> if you were to develop jQuery ui plugin a gallery and initiate it on many images, would you create one dom structure or many, for all elements?
[12:21:56] <eddiemonge> littulb: i used click instead of change because change isnt always reliable for checkboxes but this means that checking the box with the keyboard wont work
[12:22:28] <eddiemonge> but you could use change and test it to see where it doesnt work
[12:23:40] <littulb> eddiemonge.... is there a way  without using .prop() ? I'm using jquery1.5.2
[12:24:03] <djQuery> eddiemonge: just tested it and changing them via the keyboard worked in chrome

[12:26:10] <b0ot> ryrych, Could you explain to me how I might be able to update the animated progress bar from a value in a file?
[12:26:14] <djQuery> I am sure that some one has before sometime somewhere
[12:26:30] <djQuery> just ask dont look for experts
[12:26:34] <djQuery> .seen bot-t
[12:26:35] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 5 hours, 51 minutes and 35 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Ping timeout: 255 seconds
[12:26:38] <Trisox> evening
[12:26:46] <djQuery> afternoon
[12:26:50] <devinrolsen> b0ot, so basicly you want an ajax file update and progress bar.
[12:26:53] <humbug> night
[12:26:53] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/BJ45M/ any one an better way of doing this?
[12:26:59] <devinrolsen> update = upload.
[12:27:19] <djQuery> Trisox: ui.slider
[12:27:32] <b0ot> devinrolsen, I'm trying to use an animated progress bar to display some results from snmp. I have the results from snmp, but now I need the webpage to update the progress bar with the number... so essentially ues
[12:27:34] <b0ot> yes
[12:27:34] <Trisox> no needs to be with + an d0
[12:27:37] <Trisox> and -
[12:27:42] <blindMoe> Triluch: slider... or if you want the buttons, make it so someone can hold down the button to have it go quicker
[12:28:03] <djQuery> Trisox: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/BJ45M/3/
[12:28:09] <Trisox> good idea
[12:28:15] <Trisox> let me see djQuery
[12:28:29] <djQuery> <input type="number" />
[12:28:31] <eddiemonge> littulb: humbug's solution is only one way
[12:28:32] <b0ot> devinrolsen, I am using: http://jqueryui.com/demos/progressbar/#animated I see that you can set the value in the page
[12:28:39] <ryrych> b0ot: why don't you load the file with ajax?
[12:28:39] <b0ot> but I want the progress bar to move up and down
[12:28:41] <Trisox> no html5..
[12:28:46] <djQuery> why not?
[12:28:48] <b0ot> without reload
[12:28:55] <Trisox> needs to work on ie7..
[12:28:58] <b0ot> ryrych, how would I do that? I'm new to web languages
[12:29:17] <djQuery> so there are plenty of shivs that will make it work on ie7
[12:29:30] <Trisox> like
[12:29:48] <Trisox> ?
[12:29:50] <ryrych> b0ot: does the value in that file changes?
[12:29:51] <djQuery> and it still will work on ie u just dont have the up and down arrows it just displays as if it were a <input />
[12:30:07] <ryrych> by an external app?
[12:30:28] <b0ot> ryrych, I can make it change. I have the file available from a bash script, and I have my web server locally
[12:30:39] <Trisox> not a good solution for me djQuery
[12:30:43] <b0ot> I have the value that I was going to put in the file
[12:31:22] <ryrych> b0ot: ok, so want to show the progress of what?
[12:31:56] <devinrolsen> a file he is uploading.
[12:31:58] <devinrolsen> b0ot, just googling jquery ajax file upload I found this: http://www.webdeveloperjuice.com/2010/02/13/7-trusted-ajax-file-upload-plugins-using-jquery/
[12:32:09] <b0ot> ryrych, So this snmp bash scrip returns numbers 1-10. I want to display the current value of the script on the webpage dynamically
[12:32:43] <merrick> I want diagonal lines to come out of a div when its focused on.  any ideas?
[12:33:29] <b0ot> devinrolsen, I can just rewrite the file currently... so I guess I don't see how that would make it so the bar moves without the user refereshing the page
[12:33:43] <humbug> http://jsfiddle.net/TVXtE/5/  @Trisox
[12:34:00] <djQuery> Trisox: http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/demos/webforms.html
[12:34:03] <devinrolsen> the only way you will get a real time progress bar of a file being uploaded is via ajax.
[12:34:20] <djQuery> or shiver java
[12:34:21] <Trisox> your right humbug
[12:34:22] <Trisox> :)
[12:34:31] <devinrolsen> or shiver java haha
[12:34:58] * djQuery think I need to go puke now
[12:34:58] <ryrych> b0ot: yes, as devinrolsen said, and you should do it in some interval
[12:35:16] <b0ot> ryrych, how would you do that
[12:35:30] <devinrolsen> all I'm saying guys is why re-invent the wheel.
[12:35:38] <djQuery> Trisox: try this page in ie7 http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/demos/webforms.html
[12:35:44] <devinrolsen> There are lots of already made and battle tested jquery ajax file upload plugins
[12:35:46] <Trisox> i did looks nice !
[12:35:58] <Trisox> good one djQuery
[12:35:59] <Trisox> thnx
[12:36:47] <djQuery> Trisox: I just tried it useing ie9 in ie7 mode and they still worked
[12:36:59] <ryrych> I have bad luck, every time I want to ask a question about writing jquery ui plugin, I get no answer :(
[12:37:01] <Trisox> :)
[12:37:03] <Trisox> me 2
[12:37:20] <r3v3rb> eddiemonge - I fixed it ! it was a css issue ! lmao
[12:37:24] <devinrolsen> well what is your question ryrych?
[12:37:45] <ryrych> devinrolsen: if you were to develop jQuery ui plugin a gallery and initiate it on many images, would you create one dom structure or many, for all elements?
[12:37:54] <r3v3rb> devinrolsen, i have a fully functional animated menu system now :D
[12:38:10] <devinrolsen> nice r3v3rb.
[12:38:43] <r3v3rb> now it works i'll let you see the fruit (ignore the design of the site I am not responsible... )
[12:38:46] <ryrych> devinrolsen: one UI, many images
[12:38:51] <devinrolsen> ryrych, I would make the plugin iterate over all the images you feed it and one by one wrap them in the dom they need to be.
[12:38:59] <r3v3rb> http://m-spacemedia.com/insafe/
[12:39:03] <humbug> b0ot, there is a problem, a server cant send a query to user, the user has to do in on his own
[12:39:07] <r3v3rb> just gotta upload the latest
[12:39:15] <devinrolsen> but prior to doing that (if there is additional mark that is needed around the images) i would build the markup around the images first
[12:39:26] <humbug> you may set interval and download your nomber
[12:40:02] <b0ot> So there is no way to have a webpage have a progress bar that reflects the "live" value of a number in a file
[12:40:07] <b0ot> without refresh
[12:40:11] <r3v3rb> yipppppppeeeee
[12:40:18] <humbug> there is
[12:40:22] <ryrych> devinrolsen: I am iterating over all images, grab their urls (different content: images, youtube, vimeo), I only want to know their urls
[12:40:23] <r3v3rb> devinrolsen let me know what you think :D
[12:40:42] <devinrolsen> its looks great r3v3rb :) gj.
[12:40:47] <b0ot> humbug, how would you do it :)
[12:40:52] <humbug> w8
[12:40:57] <b0ot> ok :)
[12:40:59] <r3v3rb> cheers and thanks to everyones patience :D
[12:41:03] <devinrolsen> ryrych, if that is all you are doing I fail to see what the problem is..
[12:41:16] <ryrych> devinrolsen: I do it on the first element, but the problem is that, I must add a behaviour to the UI
[12:41:17] <devinrolsen> might need some more insight to what you are trying to acomplish.
[12:41:35] <devinrolsen> define behaviour
[12:41:54] <ryrych> devinrolsen: when I do it on the first, ‘this’ always refers to the first conent
[12:42:00] <ryrych> devinrolsen: I made a simple mockup
[12:42:16] <ryrych> devinrolsen: http://jsfiddle.net/ndPaH/
[12:42:30] <humbug> var t = setInterval (function () {  $(selector).load({url:URL}); },  time_interval_in_ms );
[12:42:48] <humbug> clearInterval(t);
[12:43:13] <ryrych> devinrolsen: I am looking for a best way to pass ‘this’ to the active element
[12:43:15] <humbug> it would load ur file, which contains some nomber
[12:43:36] <r3v3rb> gtg. more work to do
[12:43:39] <r3v3rb> later
[12:43:39] <humbug> buuut.... you have to set a low interval, which loads users CPU
[12:43:57] <ryrych> devinrolsen: because, for example, different instances can have different options
[12:43:57] <humbug> aaand....
[12:44:20] <humbug> if you really want to get your file downloading in realite, you have to...
[12:44:35] <humbug> hm
[12:45:53] <devinrolsen> grr sorry ryrych, I'm being pulled into a meeting right. I will have a look soon.
[12:46:01] <ryrych> devinrolsen: sure
[12:46:07] <devinrolsen> but it (from first inspecting the code) you have some scope issues.
[12:46:23] <astropirate> I have appended some html that i got via ajax into a div. All of the elements of the inputs in the div are not being rendered but the labels are. i tried sow() but no luck. anyone know what might be causing th is?
[12:46:27] <devinrolsen> you should try setting up variables vs directly assigning the values to elements.
[12:46:28] <devinrolsen> bb soon.
[12:46:49] <nickelnick> jquerymobile question for you friends. what is wrong with my page divs? is there a way to set the default page that should show when this loads?
[12:46:52] <nickelnick> http://pastie.org/2068437
[12:47:17] <humbug> var t;  $.ajax({url:URL, beforeSend: function(xhr) { t=setInterval( function() {if (xhr.readyState>2) { xhr.responseText.length; xhr.getResponseHeader('Content-Length;')} }), interval)}})
[12:47:22] <humbug> and so on
[12:47:27] <nickelnick> I take the div for page off the first page and it shows then...however my links dont work
[12:47:33] <nickelnick> just takes me to the /
[12:47:34] <humbug> b0ot, you are welcom
[12:47:56] <ryrych> devinrolsen: ok, I will be waiting and it is very interesting what you are saying, please elabore it when you're back
[12:49:38] <b0ot> humbug I don't really understand what i'm supose to do.
[12:49:55] <humbug> b0ot you r using linux
[12:50:06] <b0ot> yep
[12:50:15] <humbug> i have just given you info, read it and learn
[12:51:20] <humbug> you have  xhr.responseText.length;  you have  xhr.getResponseHeader('Content-Length'); amn you get them time by time set in Interval
[12:51:21] <nickelnick> anyone here familiar with jquery mobile?
[12:52:03] <humbug> use jquery ui progressbar({value: percent}) and thats all
[12:52:10] <Angry> Hi there
[12:52:27] <ryrych> Angry: hi
[12:53:28] <humbug> b0ot is thats all? =)
[12:53:32] <Angry> I ve an element <li><span> ...</span> my test </li>  : How can I extract "my test" without to have "..." ?
[12:53:57] <b0ot> humbug, lol I'm trying my hardest but I still don't get it
[12:54:09] <b0ot> Is that AJAX actually go in the animate.html file?
[12:54:18] <b0ot> Does that AJAX actually go in the animate.html file?
[12:54:25] <swiggy> how can i load content into TinyMCE via ajax?
[12:54:28] <swiggy> .html?
[12:54:38] <Angry> Any ideas ?
[12:55:25] <ryrych> $("li").children("not:span").text()?
[12:55:39] <ryrych> I am not sure :D
[12:56:56] <humbug> b0ot wiki:HTTP stack
[12:57:09] <humbug> b0ot wiki:ajax
[12:57:09] <ryrych> oops, "not:(span)"
[12:57:22] <ryrych> eh, :not(span)
[12:57:23] <humbug> b0ot google: content-length header
[12:57:23] <b0ot> im sorry humbug
[12:57:33] <humbug> b0ot  google:timer
[12:58:23] <sodapop> appendTo(element) what is the equivalent if i don't want to append but overwrite
[12:58:24] <humbug> b0ot google: javascript setInterval(), clearInterval()
[12:59:03] <humbug> b0ot google: javascript anonymous function
[12:59:12] <humbug> b0ot  i suppose thats all
[12:59:32] <b0ot> content-length header = cgi programming?
[12:59:47] <humbug> =)
[12:59:51] <ryrych> Angry: does it work?
[12:59:53] <humbug> google:HTTP stack
[13:00:05] <nickelnick> no jquery mobile dudes here?
[13:00:35] <humbug> b0ot, so you are a client, and you send a query to server
[13:01:10] <humbug> server processes the data, and gives you it, and sets some important headers
[13:01:45] <humbug> b0ot by getting content-length you gets data length, which server is transferring to you
[13:01:58] <b0ot> ok
[13:02:17] <humbug> and by calling anonimous function which contains xhr in its context, you may get downloaded data length
[13:02:32] <davebs> Is there a way to check if a given object has a click event registered?
[13:02:45] <humbug> after that use /dev/brain to calculate the %-ge of the downloaded data
[13:03:28] <b0ot> I'm not trying to download/upload a file
[13:03:36] <jedimind_> lies
[13:03:36] <humbug> b0ot and use jquery ui progressbar({value: percentage}) to show your bar in a candy way
[13:03:37] <b0ot> or show progress of downloading/uploading a file
[13:03:58] <jedimind_> you can just make your own status bar in like 5 minutes of html/css then adjust perecentage value with css
[13:04:14] <humbug> ooookey, you may set an interval and load your file each time
[13:04:26] <jedimind_> <div><span width="67%">67% complete</span></div> with relative position on the primary div, block span with a colour
[13:04:27] <jedimind_> and ta-da
[13:04:27] <humbug> to get the number in it
[13:04:47] <humbug> you cant catch the rvrnt when the file is changed
[13:04:55] <humbug> event*
[13:05:12] <Angry> ryrych : Don't work :s
[13:05:12] <humbug> b0ot because of HTTP protocol
[13:05:45] <ryrych> Angry: let me see
[13:05:51] <ryrych> coding this time :D
[13:06:14] <wntKissAnyAss> gentoo.de they block and ping-overflows unwanted people in irc
[13:06:19] <b0ot> humbug, I have a bash script running on the server that is querying things via snmp. I get a new value lets say for battery status on something. We will say this value is simply 1-10. I can now do whatever I want with this value... write it to a file in the /var/www/..., etc. I want my webpage to reflect a live view of this value, and update automatically.
[13:07:08] <xsamurai> Can somebody take a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/gyCvr/
[13:07:12] <humbug> b0ot, ok, thats easy
[13:07:21] <b0ot> :)
[13:07:30] <djQuery> wahnf: hey u still around?
[13:07:44] <b0ot> I just wanted something better than the bash script regenerating the entire html every time it goes out and having the user press f5
[13:07:51] <djQuery> wahnf: http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/demos/webforms.html
[13:08:11] <humbug> setInterval( function_to_download_and_render, interval_in_miliseconds );
[13:08:30] <humbug> b0ot now you have to choose your interval to  load your file
[13:08:33] <swiggy> how do i load content into tinymce via ajax
[13:08:36] <swiggy> its full html

[13:11:29] <simplestick> gf3: d3.js is bad-ass
[13:11:38] <simplestick> how did I not know about this before?

[13:14:03] <xsamurai> http://jsfiddle.net/gyCvr/ sorry dont mean to spam
[13:14:24] <xsamurai> but im a bit confused as to why something straightforward is not working
[13:14:52] <djQuery> xsamurai: works for me keeps appending it
[13:15:16] <eddiemonge> xsamurai: +1 for me as well
[13:15:17] <xsamurai> djQuery: but I would like the appended links to work in the same fashion as the original link
[13:15:52] <b0ot_linux> humbug, This: http://pastebin.com/kqjQfSQR
[13:15:54] <b0ot_linux> ?
[13:16:24] <humbug> Trisox .closest()
[13:16:25] <eddiemonge> xsamurai: then delegate() or .live()
[13:17:03] <humbug> b0ot_linux almost
[13:17:27] <Angry> eddiemonge it's null
[13:17:32] <djQuery> $(".remove").live('click', function(e){e.preventDefault(); $(this).closest('li').append($('<a></a>', {href: '#', 'class': '.remove', text: 'remove'}))'});
[13:17:34] <xsamurai> eddiemonge: thanks, i've used delegate before yet i forgot

[13:18:08] <Angry> eddimonge : I ve it
[13:18:40] <humbug> b0ot_linux  you dont have to use jquery progress bar
[13:19:01] <humbug> just load the data from your file into a $("#selector")
[13:19:04] <humbug> each interval
[13:19:48] <b0ot_linux> and then what?
[13:19:55] <djQuery> xsamurai:  $("#list").delegate('.remove', 'click', function(e){e.preventDefault(); $(this).closest('li').append($('<a></a>', {href: '#', 'class': '.remove', text: 'remove'}))'});
[13:20:14] <fogus> ok, I have: var active_tab = $("#block-menu-menu-tabs.active") , and I want to then see which of menu-337, menu-338, menu-339, or menu-340 active_tab has.  what's the best way to do that?
[13:20:31] <fogus> the menu-### are classes
[13:20:39] <humbug> b0ot_linux and thats all =)
[13:20:41] <tvanover> I am trying to adjust the jquery-ui multiple values to pull from a datalist in the page http://pastebin.com/kLqJgSw4.  But don't know how to get the filled array to source.  the html is at http://pastebin.com/Dr8qpBUw.  the problem is probbaly line 23, any thoughts?
[13:20:58] <Angry> eddiemonge I cannot find a solution with not ...
[13:21:12] <Angry> It's null or not good
[13:21:34] <djQuery> fogus: it would be better if they had some other attribute rather than having to loop through all the class and finding the class that starts with menu-
[13:21:34] <eddiemonge> elem.find(":not(span)").text()
[13:21:53] <fogus> djQuery: it's a framework thing unfortunately.  I agree with you however
[13:21:59] <b0ot_linux> humbug, I'm more confused than ever
[13:22:12] <b0ot_linux> I'm trying to get this to work with the jquery ui
[13:22:24] <b0ot_linux> but i don't need to call the function that moves the progress bar?
[13:22:30] <djQuery> fogus: then it looks like you are going to have to split the class on space then loop through each one to find the menu-
[13:23:19] <ryrych> Angry: but I don't know why this doesn't work: $("li").children().filter(":not(span)");
[13:23:31] <djQuery> tvanover: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/UsLnM/
[13:23:33] <fogus> djQuery: ok.  I haven't done that before.  I'll give it a go
[13:23:39] <Angry> eddiemonge  :  <li><span> ...</span> my test </li>  I wanna extract only "my test"
[13:24:10] <humbug> b0ot_linux u dont need jquery ui, just jquery core
[13:24:18] <eddiemonge> Angry: oh. then thats going to be hard

[13:29:16] <draginx1> i dont think that works O_o
[13:29:18] <ch3mical> Any idea how I can dynamically build an object literal?
[13:29:30] <fogus> could I do active_tab.className.slpit(" ") ?

[13:30:10] <fogus> djQuery: so $(active_tab).attr("class").split(" ") ?

[13:30:10] <humbug> b0ot_linux ?
[13:30:16] <xxiao> $("div > p"), what does > mean here?
[13:30:36] <Raverix> Means p is a direct child of div.
[13:30:39] <eddiemonge> immediate children that are p
[13:30:39] <ch3mical> xxiao: familial relation
[13:30:41] <ch3mical> ;p
[13:30:41] <humbug> just `rm oldfile| gen_new_id > oldfile`
[13:30:42] <djQuery> xxiao: all children of div's that are p's
[13:30:49] <xxiao> $(#myid a)
[13:30:53] <xxiao> thanks!
[13:30:58] <Raverix> It will select <div><p></div> but NOT <div><strong><p></strong></dive>
[13:31:12] <djQuery> xxiao: might want to go get a css tutorial
[13:31:17] <ch3mical> </dive>? Isn't that an herb?
[13:31:22] <Raverix> No, bar.
[13:31:28] <xxiao> it says the selector has css style format for family relationsh ip but i did not find the > in css
[13:31:40] <Raverix> xxiao: It's in the CSS2.0 spec.
[13:31:42] <Raverix> IIRC
[13:31:57] <ch3mical> Oh wait, </dive> is a veggie
[13:31:58] * xxiao checks css2 now

[13:32:17] <Raverix> http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/
[13:32:26] <b0ot_linux> well it's loading the results form results.html correct?
[13:32:36] <ch3mical> </dive> are related to daisies... odd
[13:32:41] <b0ot_linux> So doesn't it need to be formatted somehow? humbug
[13:33:01] <humbug> b0ot_linux no it does not
[13:33:10] <humbug> b0ot_linux just a number

[13:33:16] <ryrych> Angry: $("li").contents(":not(span)").text();
[13:33:20] <Raverix> xxiao: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html
[13:33:23] <xxiao> found css2 and it does have >
[13:33:27] <ryrych> in one chain
[13:33:32] <xxiao> w3school's css must be css1
[13:33:39] <ryrych> heck, so simple so tricky
[13:33:46] <Raverix> w3school is really not a good authority.
[13:34:02] <xxiao> then why is $('#myid a') not $(#myid > a)
[13:34:06] <djQuery> xxiao: go look at w3fools.com
[13:34:16] <hti> Hi we are trying to create widgets like igoogle, but when you click the "x" we want the widget to disappear from the web browser gui and become a click in the sidebar menu, does anyone know how to do this? thanks hti
[13:34:19] <djQuery> w3schools.com is not a good source of info
[13:34:30] <Raverix> xxiao: Depending on the markup, they could do exactly the same thing.
[13:34:35] * xxiao depends on w3schools a lot, as it's the first hit of google
[13:34:38] <djQuery> I have w3schools blocked from my google results
[13:34:54] <djQuery> and frigin expert-exchange
[13:34:59] <Raverix> xxiao: The first one selects a that is a descendent of #myid, the second only looks one level down.
[13:35:07] <Raverix> djQuery: I've found some good stuff on expert-exchange....
[13:35:12] <Raverix> Just scroll all the way to the bottom :)
[13:35:17] <Raverix> Where the answers aren't obscured.
[13:35:26] <b0ot_linux> humbug, I ran your pastebin and I got just a blank screen
[13:35:29] <djQuery> Raverix: yes if you can get past thier ads and crap
[13:35:34] <xxiao> expert-exchange? it's all ads
[13:35:40] <b0ot_linux> I have results.html as 55
[13:35:49] <Raverix> Truly, just scroll down to the very, very bottom.
[13:36:35] <odyniec> Angry: my version: $('li').clone().children().empty().parent().text() - this should work on any child element, not necessarily span
[13:36:53] <humbug> http://pastebin.com/DnLBEY1t   b0ot_linux
[13:37:21] <ryrych> odyniec: haha, jquery is soo versatile
[13:37:26] <b0ot_linux> humbug, = blank screen
[13:37:46] <b0ot_linux> at least for me
[13:38:13] <odyniec> ryrych: TMTOWTDI :)
[13:38:26] <nickelnick> anyone here familiar with jquerymobile?
[13:38:29] <ryrych> odyniec: ?
[13:38:38] <Raverix> Personally, I refuse to use jQuery mobile :p
[13:38:46] <blindMoe> I like jquery mobile
[13:38:50] <blindMoe> works pretty well
[13:39:14] <blindMoe> Raverix: what are your reasons to not use it?
[13:39:14] <odyniec> ryrych: There's More Than One Way To Do It - the motto of Perl, also applicable to jQuery
[13:39:24] <nickelnick> i'm having some problem with the page loading
[13:39:24] <xxiao> so, is w3fools a bugzilla for w3schools?
[13:39:36] <Raverix> Well, instead of needing a bloated framework (jQuery) and then a second library on top (jQuery Mobile), why not use a library which is optimized for mobile?
[13:39:38] <nickelnick> like when you have two or morepages on one php file
[13:39:39] <xxiao> hard to get out of good info there without spending 100 hours on that site
[13:39:39] <djQuery> http://dilbert.com/dyn/str_strip/000000000/00000000/0000000/100000/20000/5000/100/125101/125101.strip.gif
[13:39:48] <humbug> b0ot_linux bb
[13:40:17] <eddiemonge> Raverix: jquery is bloated? lol
[13:40:24] <eddiemonge> what do you prefer then?
[13:40:34] <Raverix> eddiemonge: When referring to mobile only, yes.
[13:40:38] <blindMoe> Raverix: understandable.. but my phone loads all my jquery mobile sites instantly
[13:40:40] <xxiao> what's the best jquery book?
[13:40:51] <djQuery> jquery fundamentals
[13:40:56] <eddiemonge> Raverix: what do you suggest then?
[13:40:58] <djQuery> xxiao: and its free
[13:40:59] <xxiao> one book rules all, better also as a reference on the table
[13:41:12] <nickelnick> blindMoe: http://pastie.org/2068437 do you see anything wrong with how my pages are setup? this link takes me to the root of menu yet i see in the dev console that the div page im going to is there.
[13:41:13] <xxiao> djQuery: checking...
[13:41:39] <Raverix> There are several mobile specific javascript libraries, I've been playing with several of them... can't say any one has stood out above the others... but:
[13:41:40] <djQuery> http://jqfundamentals.com/
[13:41:57] <eddiemonge> Raverix: to me jqm is the best so far
[13:42:15] <Raverix> Sencha, xui, baseJS
[13:42:51] <blindMoe> nickelnick: I don't see anything wrong with that code
[13:42:57] <Raverix> eddiemonge: Yeah, but it's about 5x larger than it needs to be.
[13:43:05] <nickelnick> dangit
[13:43:05] <fogus> djQuery: does this look like I have the right idea: http://pastebin.com/tMzDcZiV ?
[13:43:15] <Raverix> And last I checked, the earlier smart phones have trouble caching jQuery because it's too larg.
[13:43:56] <eddiemonge> Raverix: have you looked at jqm's supported devices?
[13:44:06] <Raverix> Note the 'caching'
[13:44:10] <xxiao> djQuery: cool, studying it now
[13:44:12] <Raverix> It'll work, but not cache.
[13:44:16] <nickelnick> blindMoe: would href="/?p=viewCart#cartProducts" work?
[13:44:16] <Raverix> So you redownload it on each page.
[13:44:23] <luigi69> hi, whenever i do an ajax request i get error 400 Bad Request, why ? Here is the url -> red button on bottom http://fb.zasypiam.pl/searchtab/details/krakow/484/dla-2-od-20110614-do-20110614
[13:44:23] <djQuery> fogus: yeah something like that but u can do away with the active_tab and just do $("#block-menu-menu-tabs .active").attr("class").split(" ");
[13:44:50] <eddiemonge> luigi69: you disabled scrolling
[13:44:52] <blindMoe> nickelnick: can't you just do href="/cartProducts"  ?
[13:44:57] <luigi69> use arrows
[13:45:02] <fogus> djQuery: right, makes sense.  thanks for looking!
[13:45:28] <luigi69> eddiemonge use keyboard plz, it is a facebook app, sow it resizes under facebook iframe
[13:45:42] <nickelnick> no...wouldnt it be /#cartProducts
[13:45:42] <eddiemonge> keyboard doesnt work and there are no arrows
[13:45:55] <djQuery> fogus: and if you are having to do specific things for specific items why not just put click handlers on those specific items?
[13:46:40] <luigi69> eddiemonge - i have turned scrolling on
[13:46:44] <Raverix> eddiemonge: I think the biggest issue I have is that when I optimize my mobile sites, I end up in some situations having web pages + graphics < 10kb, and then jQuery is 31KB...
[13:47:04] <beakerman> what's the canonical way to define constants when authoring a plugin, such that they are scoped to that plugin?
[13:47:25] <djQuery> fogus:  or do if ($('.menu-337).hasClass('.active')){$(".leaf.menu-337").addClass("self-active-right-inactive"); }
[13:47:30] <ryrych> how is created a ui plugin? if you initialise it first, it is stored in $.ui.pluginName, right?
[13:47:32] <Raverix> Hell, $ = document.querySelectorAll, now I've got half of jQuery :p
[13:48:01] <eddiemonge> Raverix: except qsa doesnt work in a lot of places, especially mobile
[13:48:10] <eddiemonge> luigi69: i dont see any 400
[13:48:19] <ryrych> anyone knows?
[13:48:26] <djQuery> ryrych: its is stored in the elements data('widgetnamespace.widgetname')
[13:48:30] <djQuery> i think
[13:48:46] <Raverix> eddiemonge: Still :p
[13:49:00] <nickelnick> blindMoe: i thought you refer to div pages with #
[13:49:04] <ryrych> djQuery: in elements there is copy
[13:49:09] <ryrych> an instance
[13:49:14] <djQuery> Raverix: if the browser supports querySelectorAll
[13:49:21] <djQuery> ryrych: yes
[13:49:52] <ryrych> djQuery: I would like to inject some code when it is created for the first time
[13:49:59] <djQuery> ryrych: do a console.log of an elements data so that you know for sure
[13:50:09] <Krinkle> Hm.. upgradeded from 1.4.4 to 1.6.1, code like $foo.attr('id').indexOf( ''foobar" ). no longer works properly as attr() may return undefined.
[13:50:14] <Krinkle> should I use prop() for that ?
[13:50:29] <djQuery> ryrych: well that's what the _init and _create are for.
[13:50:32] <Krinkle> I read johnResig's blog post but I'm still somewhat confused.
[13:50:53] <ryrych> djQuery: but _create is run every time a new plugin is intiated
[13:50:58] <djQuery> ryrych: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide1
[13:51:17] <ryrych> djQuery: I would like some pre :D
[13:51:45] <luigi69> eddiemonge http://fb.zasypiam.pl/assets/screen.PNG
[13:51:47] <djQuery> ryrych: _create is run when your widget is attached to an element
[13:51:51] <innociv> What is the right way to catch QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR in chrome?  I'm trying a try { localStorage.set().... } catch(e) { if( e... ?) }  if e == 'QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR'  and  e == QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR both don't work
[13:52:22] <xxiao> after i sent out an ajax call, the server will send back a html which i want to display portion of it
[13:52:50] <xxiao> e.g. {'#myid p'}, how do i do that?
[13:53:07] <xxiao> i don't wanna to have a html shown each time i hit the jquery submit button
[13:53:10] <djQuery> ryrych: so run the very first time the widget is added to any element. then put a check in the _create to see if $.wiget.runonce === true;
[13:53:15] <ryrych> djQuery: yes, but I would like to perform some code only, only once :)
[13:53:24] <eddiemonge> luigi69: i wasnt getting that
[13:53:42] <ryrych> djQeury: now I am using a dirty flag on body :)
[13:53:48] <ryrych> quite similar to yours
[13:53:50] <Raverix> xxiao: Can you be a bit more specific with what you want to do with the response from the server?
[13:54:07] <ryrych> djQuery ↑
[13:54:13] <RobertV> <div id="one two">   i'm trying to remove this tag; is this the way to do it?  $('div#one').remove(); $('div#two').remove();
[13:54:26] <xxiao> i'm porting an old cgi-bin to jquery, the old cgi will reponse with a html page with lots of info on it
[13:54:37] <eddiemonge> luigi69: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://www.zasypiam.pl/pl/apartment/reserve/484. Origin http://fb.zasypiam.pl is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin
[13:54:37] <djQuery> _create: function(){ if(!$.widgetname.runnneded) {  do additional setup; $.widgetname.runnneded = true; }   }
[13:54:44] <eddiemonge> luigi69: its a case of same origin policy
[13:54:51] <djQuery> ryrych: ^^^^^^^
[13:54:52] <luigi69> eddiemonge but it is on the same server
[13:55:01] <sk8ball> can anyone take a look at http://www.pastie.org/2068766 ... i'm trying to use the sortable plugin's update function but want to do it progmatically w/o hardcoding the lists id
[13:55:02] <ryrych> djQuery: could you take a look at my code? a mockup?
[13:55:03] <xxiao> using jquery, i want to extract portion of that html and dispaly in a jquery popup
[13:55:07] <luigi69> eddiemonge just under diffrent directory
[13:55:08] <ryrych> working mockup
[13:55:12] <Raverix> In your success function, you'll get passed back the entire string of text... you'll just have to parse it out.
[13:55:21] <Raverix> HOW to parse it out, depends on the data.
[13:55:25] <djQuery> ryrych: I sure that several will help send a fiddle
[13:55:40] <xxiao> Raverix: what method will show the result i parse? .show()?
[13:55:51] <Raverix> If you can be sure it's a valid XHTML, you can turn it into a xml document.
[13:55:57] <ryrych> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/ndPaH/1/
[13:56:00] <Raverix> Otherwise, you'll have to parse it out by knowing what's around it.
[13:56:07] <Raverix> xxiao: Define 'show the result'
[13:56:07] <eddiemonge> luigi69: its under a different subdomain
[13:56:11] <dotwired> hi, does anyone know a jquery multi column plugin for text?
[13:56:11] <ryrych> djQuery: I can't figure it out :(
[13:56:27] <Raverix> xxiao: You could add it to the page, set it to an input, do an alert, iframe, etc...
[13:56:31] <xxiao> Raverix: see i have a <p>output power is 10 watts</p> by cgi
[13:56:43] <xxiao> i want to display that in jquery
[13:56:49] <Raverix> 'display'?
[13:56:59] <dotwired> but not the common ones where i can define how many columns
[13:57:05] <xxiao> show it on the jquery
[13:57:08] <ryrych> djQuery: the problem is that I added event handler on the first element and now it always refers to ‘this’ of that element
[13:57:16] <Raverix> xxiao: That question, makes no sense.
[13:57:16] <dotwired> just defining 1 height and the plugin does the columning?
[13:57:27] <xxiao> i have a button in jquery, after i click that it will invoke ajax which will get that response(html)
[13:57:33] <xxiao> i need see it
[13:57:41] <Raverix> Alright, well, how would you like to see it?
[13:57:47] <Raverix> Raverix	xxiao: You could add it to the page, set it to an input, do an alert, iframe, etc...
[13:57:49] <xxiao> on a popup window
[13:58:00] <Raverix> alert(response)
[13:58:01] <ryrych> djQuery: what would you recomend?
[13:58:38] <luigi69> so how could i make an ajax call for a subdomain without violating 'origin policy' ?
[13:59:00] <xxiao> Raverix: can I show it in the window where my submit button is?
[13:59:01] <eddiemonge> dont use absolute urls. use relative like src: '/path/to/wherever'
[13:59:03] <sk8ball> can anyone take a look at http://www.pastie.org/2068766 ... i'm trying to use the sortable plugin's update function but want to do it progmatically w/o hardcoding the lists id .... ???
[13:59:09] <ryrych> djQuery: the most elegant way? :)
[13:59:19] <xxiao> say, display it on top of the button after i click that
[13:59:21] <eddiemonge> luigi69: or use some form of window.location.href
[13:59:53] <Raverix> xxiao: Make an empty div where you want the response to go, say <div id='response'></div>, and then the jquery: $('#response').html(response);
[13:59:59] <djQuery> ryrych: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/ndPaH/3/
[14:00:09] <xxiao> Raverix: thanks!!
[14:00:13] * xxiao is trying that now
[14:00:36] <djQuery> ryrych: oops had a . instead of a #  http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/ndPaH/4/
[14:01:08] <astropirate> I have added some html that i got via ajax into a div using html(). All of the input elements in the div are not being rendered but the labels are. i tried show() but no luck. anyone know what might be causing this?  the label elements are being shown. They are visible in firebug but not in the the page. They take space but aren't visible :S
[14:02:39] <luigi69> eddiemonge i cannot use relative path in this context, how would window.location.href help me ?
[14:02:42] <Raverix> Use Firebug / Chrome / Safari, right click where the inputs are supposed to be, inspect
[14:02:50] <sodapop> i'm trying to capture the submit of a form (<form action="#" method="post" id="myform" name="myform">) using $('#myform').submit(function(){....
[14:02:53] <sodapop> is this correct?
[14:02:59] <ryrych> djQuery: wont work :D
[14:03:07] <ryrych> even though I used #
[14:03:15] <Raverix> astropirate: Take a look at the styles associated with the inputs.
[14:03:48] <Raverix> sodapop: Yes.
[14:04:16] <astropirate> Raverix, did, I even set an ID and explicitly set style for it to be shown yet nothinig :S One thing that is intresting is that that all of them, labels and inputs are grayed out in firebug
[14:04:20] <eddiemonge> luigi69: to get the url of the page and use that
[14:04:50] <Raverix> Is the site available online?
[14:04:55] <xxiao> where can I find all the jquery method reference?
[14:05:12] <xxiao> how do I know which object supports which method...could not find it yet
[14:05:49] <sodapop> Raverix, is not executing the function and page submits, the form is created dynamically can this be the problem ?
[14:06:27] <innociv> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Storage> has no method 'remove'
[14:06:30] <innociv> wtf?..
[14:06:52] <Raverix> sodapop: Are you attaching the handler to the form before or after putting it on the page?
[14:07:23] <ryanneufeld> anyone know of a php list() equivalent in javascript?
[14:07:31] <Raverix> Doesn't exist
[14:07:51] <byteme_> how can I prevent my contact form from submitting when I click sign up on the Newsletter sidebar   http://216.119.82.19/contact.aspx
[14:08:36] <sodapop> Raverix, after
[14:08:39] <ryrych> djQuery ?
[14:08:44] <ryrych> are you there? :D
[14:08:47] <Raverix> sodapop: Are you SURE?
[14:09:20] <Raverix> Wait... what makes you think your function isn't being called?
[14:10:00] <Raverix> If you're not preventing the default event from happening, it'll continue to submit the page.
[14:10:05] <sodapop> Raverix, alert inside the function not shown
[14:10:15] <djQuery> ryrych: i am here and there and parts of me are elsewhere
[14:11:13] <sodapop> Raverix, i'm an idiot nevermind
[14:11:21] <ryrych> djQuery: that's good :D I like your approach of running one time
[14:11:31] <Raverix> sodapop: Out of curiosity, what was the issue?
[14:11:32] <ryrych> djQuery: but what about the scope issue?
[14:11:53] <djQuery> hmmm move the click handlers out of the if statement?
[14:11:55] <xxiao> javascript has lots of methods which i can find them via google, but i could not find anyting jquery adds as far as methods are concerned
[14:12:02] <sodapop> forgot to upload the new js into the server
[14:12:03] <djQuery> no that would register them twice
[14:12:10] <ryrych> djQuery: or many times
[14:12:16] <Raverix> sodapop: Fail.
[14:12:35] <innociv> How the fuck is for( var key in localStorage ) { console.log(key); } returning []?
[14:12:41] <innociv> How can a key be []?
[14:12:52] <Raverix> Yesterday, I had someone in ##php upload the wrong file 3 times... he did foo/bar/products.php, instead of foo/bar/themes/main/products.php
[14:12:53] <djQuery> ryrych: and why have next and previous private?
[14:12:57] <Raverix> sodapop: It happens :)
[14:13:11] <xxiao> Raverix: for example, the code you should $('#response').html(my-parsed-result), how do I know that html method exists?
[14:13:13] <mdpatrick> What's the point of .attr when .setAttribute and .getAttribute do the same thing?
[14:13:17] <xxiao> s/should/show
[14:13:40] <Raverix> xxiao: "Documentation"
[14:13:44] <CESDave> djQuery, eddiemonge, geekbuntu: Hey guys, thanks for helping out earlier.  In case you're interested, I found out what was causing my issue.  I was trying to do this: $(selector, $(selector)).live(action, handler);  But, jQuery required a DOM node as a context for live event handlers.  So it should have been this: $(selector, $(selector)[0]).live(action, handler);  This is confusing since contexts don't behave this way in other pla
[14:13:51] <astropirate> Raverix, sorry had to afk, no the site isnt' avialbale
[14:14:02] <ryrych> djQuery: do you mean _next as a private?
[14:14:04] <xxiao> Raverix: searched hard there, found events,properties,etc, but not methods, maybe they're buried
[14:14:20] <Raverix> xxiao: You didn't look well.
[14:14:38] <djQuery> ryrych: somewhere where you initialy open the lightbox have it set a property of the #lightbox to tell it what set of images to look at
[14:14:38] <Raverix> http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/
[14:14:49] <Raverix> There are all the DOM manipulation functions available to you.
[14:14:56] <Raverix> I would suggest you read the entire list.
[14:15:12] <Raverix> So that later on, when you need one, it might trigger 'Oh hey, wasn't there a function for that?'
[14:15:18] <xxiao> Raverix: thanks again
[14:15:31] <xxiao> Raverix: my 3rd day on jquery :)
[14:15:54] <Raverix> xxiao: Stick with it, very good library for quickly writing concise javascript.
[14:16:12] * xxiao loves it so far
[14:16:29] <Raverix> Just be aware... that sometimes jQuery can be evil...
[14:16:32] <djQuery> ryrych: any methods with an undersoce are private
[14:16:46] <ryrych> djQuery: I know, but I don't understand your previous msg
[14:16:46] <djQuery> ryrych: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide9
[14:16:59] <JordiGH> j is well defined, it's some index. However, this doesn't seem to be working the way I would expect. Is the the wrong way to iterate over things matched by a selector? http://pastebin.com/ED8G7Dmh
[14:17:02] <ryrych> djQuery: it's only an example
[14:17:10] <ryrych> the simplest as possible
[14:17:16] <djQuery> ryrych: well what if I wanted to do $('selector')lightbox('next');
[14:18:17] <djQuery> ryrych: or rather $('.next').click(function(){ $('div').lightbox('next');});
[14:18:31] <ryrych> djQuery: in the real lightbox that's ok, but it is an example to help me to ask people to how to escape the scope :D
[14:18:53] <ryrych> hm
[14:19:05] <gnarf> djQuery: can you restate the question?
[14:19:09] <gnarf> or ryrych
[14:19:16] <gnarf> dunno who's question it is :)
[14:19:34] <ryrych> gnarf: ?
[14:19:49] <JordiGH> Is doing "for(var foo in $(".selector"))" a bad idea?
[14:19:56] <gnarf> JordiGH: horrible idea
[14:19:59] <JordiGH> I don't want to use more indices; I'm running out of index variables.
[14:19:59] <gnarf> JordiGH: what do you want to do?
[14:20:09] <JordiGH> I want to iterate over the things matched by the selector.
[14:20:11] <Raverix> $('.selector').each(function(){})
[14:20:13] <gnarf> ?each
[14:20:17] <djQuery> yooo hey gnarf aint seen u in a while.
[14:20:19] <gnarf> no bot-t booo
[14:20:23] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/each
[14:20:28] <Tidwell> JordiGH: very bad, use .each
[14:20:31] <Raverix> What he said.
[14:20:38] <djQuery> .seen bot-t
[14:20:39] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 7 hours, 45 minutes and 39 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Ping timeout: 255 seconds
[14:21:05] <JordiGH> I guess the callback function is passed the matched thing as the first argument?
[14:21:09] * JordiGH rtfms.
[14:21:18] <djQuery> gnarf: maybe we outa setup a irc server with a bot-t built into it.
[14:21:36] <Woet> or run a cluster supporting bot-t
[14:21:38] <djQuery> have it to where only ops can set the messages
[14:21:47] <JordiGH> Ah, I can just use $(this)
[14:23:03] <djQuery> gnarf: ryrych: basicaly ryrych is trying to create a loghtbox using the widget factory. but he wants to use an <div> for displaying the image that is only created once and shared between all the lightboxes.
[14:23:24] <djQuery> lol loghtbox mean lightbox
[14:23:27] <JordiGH> lol
[14:23:56] <sodapop> Raverix, is possible to call a function using ajax within the submit function ?
[14:24:08] <djQuery> gnarf:  http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/ndPaH/4/ here is what he has so far
[14:24:09] <Raverix> Of course.
[14:24:23] <Raverix> sodapop: There's no restriction to what javascript calls you make anywhere.
[14:24:25] <ryrych> djQuery: hm, I don't quite understand your second snippet
[14:24:59] <sodapop> Raverix, where the should i return false ? cause it gets ignored
[14:26:02] <Raverix> $('#yourform').submit(function() { alert('Am I run?'); return false;});
[14:26:07] <ryrych> djQuery, gnarf: that's right, many piece of contents (images, yt, vimeo), store their urls, one structure
[14:27:10] <ryrych> gnarf: because structure is created once, and handlers are added also once, ‘this’ always refers to the first piece of content
[14:27:43] <innociv> How come localStorage['241lucia%20van%20ivismonths']; returns the data fine, but localStorage.remove('241lucia%20van%20ivismonths'); returns TypeError: Object #<Storage> has no method 'remove' ?
[14:27:52] <gnarf> ryrych: i think you're organizing it wrong
[14:28:15] <ryrych> gnarf: how would you do it?
[14:28:27] <gnarf> ryrych: i think a) you should store the "global plugin" variables in the plugin itself
[14:28:39] <gnarf> like $.ui.test.lightboxDialog
[14:28:54] <erichynds> innociv: removeItem
[14:29:27] <JordiGH> Does the callback function passed to each have access to the enclosing scope?
[14:29:34] * JordiGH still doesn't really get javascript scope, heh.
[14:29:34] <ryrych> gnarf: b) ?
[14:29:52] <JordiGH> passed to .each()
[14:30:01] <gnarf> make a _getLightboxDialog() function
[14:30:11] <innociv> Wow a lot of sites say remove()
[14:30:12] <gnarf> that checks that global plugin var
[14:30:14] <gnarf> or makes it
[14:30:28] <gnarf> c) i think you should look at actually using ui.dialog for the lightbox itself
[14:30:44] <gnarf> and modify the "buttons"
[14:31:14] <janthony> var loadURL = hashedURL.replace('http://infinitworldwide.com/#!/','http://infinitworldwide.com/'); - any idea why this line would throw an error in IE but nothing in firefox/chrome, or firefox console. The error it's throwing in IE is "'undefined' is null or not an object
[14:31:19] <ryanneufeld> how do you kill an each?
[14:31:24] <gnarf> d) as far as the "queue" of elements goes, also store that in the $.my.lightbox.decorated = array
[14:31:34] <ryrych> gnarf: actually, the real one is similar to dialog
[14:32:00] <gnarf> ryrych: so use dialog - and modify its behavior in your plugin
[14:32:02] <ryanneufeld> $.each(obj, function(){}); I wan't it stop the each when a condition is met
[14:32:11] <ryanneufeld> s/wan't/want/
[14:32:19] <gnarf> ryrych: also, i would store the "current" in $.my.lightbox.currentElement
[14:32:29] <Raverix> ryanneufeld: You'll need custom code for that.
[14:32:42] <gnarf> ryrych: you get where I'm goin with it?
[14:32:46] <JordiGH> This can't be the right way to use each: http://pastebin.com/JAzKNRFz
[14:33:01] <ryrych> gnarf: Ok, but what is the real difference of storing in the same scope as _create and in $.ui.lightbox?
[14:33:03] <JordiGH> Surely the scope of variables is wrong?
[14:33:17] * JordiGH will tias in a sec.
[14:33:22] <gnarf> ryrych: organization makes scoping easier
[14:33:42] <gnarf> ryrych: the global events / global stuff can reference the "currentElement"
[14:33:45] <ryanneufeld> perhaps $.map is what I want instead
[14:33:49] <ajpiano> JordiGH: you should use map, see http://ajpiano.com/2010/when-to-use-jquerys-map-methods/
[14:34:01] <ajpiano> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[14:34:08] <ajpiano> and also $("foo").map() works...
[14:34:12] <ryrych> gnarf: so I should write a wrapper: getter, setter to access these variables?
[14:34:29] <JordiGH> "pee" "poo".
[14:34:31] <JordiGH> Hm.
[14:34:40] <JordiGH> I'll try to take this seriously despite the metasyntactic variables.
[14:35:45] <ryrych> nah, I’m tired :(
[14:36:50] <JordiGH> ajpiano: How can I do it if I want to define attributes of an object instead of an array? As in lines 6-10 of my post above.
[14:38:18] <janthony> var loadURL = hashedURL.replace('http://infinitworldwide.com/#!/','http://infinitworldwide.com/'); - Any idea why this would crash IE? the error it's reporting in IE is 'undefined' is null or not an object. Works fine in FF and nothing is outputing to firebug console. (sorry for repeat, my IRC client froze)
[14:38:33] <JordiGH> It *crashes* IE?
[14:38:44] <JordiGH> Like, "this program has performed an illegal operation and will now shut down"?
[14:38:55] <janthony> JordiGH: well, actually doesn't crash, throws a pop up JS error
[14:39:06] <ajpiano> JordiGH: can't use map for creating objects, i may have misread your snippet :p
[14:39:27] <JordiGH> Man, you're not the first one to say "crash" when you mean "emits an error".
[14:39:59] <draginx1> http://pastie.org/private/4gwlfyhrphgybwkqe8w how come I cant do self.me.offset() ? self.me = jquery object -_-
[14:40:00] <ajpiano> JordiGH: $(".foo", $(this)) is silly, just do $(this).find(".foo")
[14:40:03] <JordiGH> I'm getting too old, now that the OS is the browser, it crashes when the browser emits the error, not the surrounding OS.
[14:41:08] <JordiGH> ajpiano: Is there a difference?
[14:41:14] <ajpiano> JordiGH: and a stringy context is even worse, just do $("#item_"+j+" .grammar_spec");
[14:42:03] <JordiGH> ajpiano: But does that do what I want it to do? I want all the elements with the grammar_spec class inside the element with id "item_" + j.
[14:42:12] <ajpiano> the one you have is just a less readable version of what it would be converted into and wraps 'this' in a jquery object unecessarily whereas it would be wrapped if you just passed as context not as a jquery object
[14:42:21] <ajpiano> yes, both of them do what you want
[14:42:37] <ryrych> gnarf: thanks, I'll tackle this tomorrow
[14:42:39] <ajpiano> context is not really like, a necessary thing to use just because you want a scoped search
[14:42:42] <ryrych> good night everybody
[14:42:55] <ajpiano> using context just gets converted into $(context).find(selector)
[14:43:03] <JordiGH> Alright.
[14:43:57] <JordiGH> Any more stylistic things? Thanks for those two, btw.
[14:45:13] <ajpiano> nothin at the moment
[14:45:36] <JordiGH> So, as to how to build an object out of each matched element...
[14:46:56] <ajpiano> well i guess
[14:47:30] <ajpiano> hold on, making a paste
[14:51:20] <ajpiano> JordiGH, http://pastebin.com/TCdichxx is how i would do it
[14:51:23] <ajpiano> something like that should work...
[14:52:15] <JordiGH> That will work?
[14:52:17] <JordiGH> it's so concise.
[14:52:28] <JordiGH> ajpiano: http://jordi.platinum.linux.pl/piccies/uncertain.jpg
[14:52:37] <ajpiano> why wouldn't it
[14:52:42] <JordiGH> I don't know.
[14:52:47] <JordiGH> There must be a catch.
[14:52:49] <JordiGH> A catch!
[14:53:03] <ajpiano> oh ffuu
[14:53:05] <ajpiano> i forgot one line
[14:53:34] <ajpiano> http://pastebin.com/jsyxkVS0
[14:53:49] <ajpiano> what you return in the map function is what gets pushed into the array
[14:54:01] <JordiGH> Got it.
[14:55:13] <byteme_> http://216.119.82.19/lunch.aspx   anyone recommend a better way to transition between the different menu items ?  Clicking on a new menu item isnt very graceful currently
[14:58:52] <JordiGH> byteme_: Are you actually refreshing the page with each click?
[14:59:13] <JordiGH> byteme_: If the menus are indeed gonna be this small, couldn't you just change them with mouseover?
[15:01:02] <byteme_> could yes JordiGH  Im just desiging to what they asked for..just didnt like the page refresh
[15:01:27] <sk8ball> http://www.pastie.org/2068766  .... this uses jquery sortable... how could i change this so i don't have to hard code the id of the list in?
[15:02:11] <JordiGH> byteme_: I don't think they meant "refresh the page when you click", even if that's what they said. ;-)
[15:02:50] <draginx1> ok animations are really f'ed up O_o http://pastie.org/private/dfpv8usks4mgk2v50oubvq how come it just removes the object?
[15:02:57] <draginx1> Should I not use $(this) inside the queue?
[15:04:21] <byteme_> this site was a rework of another site..no excuse but shrug
[15:04:44] <ngharo> byteme_: no reason to ajaxify the navigation links imo
[15:05:25] <ngharo> i'd just clean up the URL for SEO and be done with it
[15:05:46] <byteme_> yeah just a test server
[15:06:55] <ngharo> i mean the id=3 could be /lunch/burgers or something
[15:10:44] <Phil-Work> how would I get the position of an a tag relitive to the iframe it's in?
[15:11:02] <Phil-Work> .offset() returns strange data
[15:12:03] <JordiGH> ajpiano: Heh, you had a type.
[15:12:04] <JordiGH> typo
[15:12:17] <JordiGH> " .grammar_spec" not ".grammar_spec"
[15:12:37] <Phil-Work> that said...
[15:12:48] <Phil-Work> if the browser is scrolled to the top when I refresh, it works fine
[15:12:53] <Phil-Work> otherwise it doesn't
[15:31:11] <dotwired> hi, is there a good column plugin for jquery somewhere?
[15:31:23] <dotwired> but no plugin with predefined number of columns
[15:31:46] <dotwired> it should column automatially, depending on how much content and how high the parent container is
[15:37:44] <fogus> can someone take a look at http://beta.faithvan.com and the js in http://pastebin.com/MMPgJcbJ and give me a little explanation as to why the alert that comes up has only one entry?
[15:38:13] <fogus> var classes_of_active_tab = $("#block-menu-menu-tabs a.active").attr("class").split(/\s+/); should return a string with all classes of that <a>, no?
[15:38:23] <fogus> but it only returns "active" to me
[15:39:16] <ch3mical> Hmmm.. How do I disable a button on a jqUI dialog?
[15:39:29] <ch3mical> They don't come with IDs or any easy way to identify them :/
[15:42:22] <fogus> even $(".active").attr("class").split(" "); only has one entry
[15:42:25] <fogus> why is that?
[15:43:02] <fogus> alert(classes_of_active_tab.length) = 1
[15:46:46] <pifantastic> fogus
[15:46:53] <pifantastic> it's matching the a
[15:46:55] <pifantastic> <a>
[15:47:00] <pifantastic> which only has 1 class
[15:47:26] <pifantastic> did you mean jQuery("#block-menu-menu-tabs").attr("class").split(/\s+/); ?
[15:48:04] <pifantastic> the item you are selecting only has one class: http://grimhappy.com/i/edbffdf.png
[15:49:35] <fogus> pifantastic: but shouldn't it inherit other classes?
[15:49:48] <pifantastic> no bro
[15:49:50] <pifantastic> that's not how it works
[15:50:05] <fogus> ok, well, how can I get the class above it?
[15:50:35] <pifantastic> parent()
[15:50:50] <fogus> pifantastic: how can I get http://pastebin.com/aab7W3Xx to give me "firstclass secondclass"?
[15:51:08] <Brodingo> inherit classes <_<
[15:51:23] <fogus> how?
[15:51:24] <pifantastic> fogus: why would you ever need that?
[15:51:36] <fogus> its a story so long, even I can't remember it all
[15:51:39] <pifantastic> fogus: http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[15:51:54] <albacker> how to get the first li parent? $(this).parent('li') ?
[15:52:07] <pifantastic> :first
[15:52:37] <fogus> pifantastic: I want to give classes to my tabs
[15:52:59] <fogus> http://pastebin.com/MMPgJcbJ
[15:53:11] <pifantastic> fogus: might be time to dig into Drupal and not try to shim everything on with jQuery
[15:53:20] <fogus> I've done that also
[15:53:28] <fogus> "shim everything" lol
[15:53:40] <fogus> I try to add one class and I'm "shimming everythign"
[15:53:57] <jjb123> Hey everyone, I'm having a problem with jquery-validate that I just can't figure out. I'm using jquery-validate on a basic login form to make sure both the email and password are entered and to make sure the email is valid. The problem is that after I submit the form (to trigger the validation), the email validation won't respond to any input. For example, if I type anything into the password field, the error goes away, but when I type an
[15:53:58] <fogus> it is not possible to do in Drupal without JS, I've been told by the experts
[15:55:20] <pifantastic> fogus: turns out, I am a Drupal expert
[15:55:26] <fogus> nice!
[15:55:37] <fogus> how do you do overlapping tabs with transparency?
[15:56:07] <pifantastic> I have no idea what the context of that is
[15:56:23] <Brodingo> but probably negative margins and rgba
[15:56:33] <Brodingo> and some zindex magic
[15:56:38] <pifantastic> ^
[15:56:42] <fogus> I can't do the zindex or overlapping
[15:56:49] <fogus> that doesn't work with the transparrency
[15:56:58] <pifantastic> wat
[15:56:59] <fogus> but this jquery stuff just worked
[15:57:10] <pifantastic> PROBLEM SOLVED!

[15:58:01] <duttonstuart> hi gents..
[15:58:11] <bobbobbins> hey, i have an issue...here is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/jebcL/  if you look where it defines variation one...if i alert data.metric[0].METRIC_DATA_VALUE it has the right value...but when i call my chart and use that value...nothing is there
[15:58:29] <dachary> Hi, which tool would you recommend to minify javascript ? I see a number of them when looking around but not sure what is the most popular / reliable.
[15:58:37] <duttonstuart> I am wondering if you could help with clearing some form data inside a modal box..
[15:58:49] <duttonstuart> this is in a jquery modal script
[15:58:55] <duttonstuart> called reveal
[15:59:39] <bobbobbins> but the title shows up correct, so i don't get it
[16:00:01] <pifantastic> dachary: UglifyJS
[16:00:45] <duttonstuart> I have a iframed form that loads via a call to reveal ..  this loads a php contact form and then on submit loads a thankyou page . but when I close the modal box and reopen it the thank you page is still there and so its not been cleared..
[16:01:33] <dachary> pifantastic: I forgot to specify that I would like a free software tool to carry around and make sure it does not get lost or forgotten ;-)
[16:01:52] <duttonstuart> I need to be able to unload the data in modal without page refresh so that when the enquiry link is clicked the modal box reopens with the cleared form
[16:02:38] <duttonstuart> code available if someone could have a quick look .
[16:06:34] <cuQa> umm
[16:06:47] <cuQa> when I mine my dual core temperature goes up to 99
[16:06:52] <cuQa> celsius
[16:06:57] <cuQa> cant be normal huh? :/
[16:08:13] <Moody> hi there
[16:09:29] <Moody> i've got a question, i have a form with file input i send thrue ajax, is it possible to get the progression of the transfer ?
[16:10:06] <Moody> to make something like a progress bar
[16:10:39] <bobbobbins> can someone take a look at my script?
[16:12:26] <janthony> Any idea why the console for IE7 and IE8 would be returning error @ jquery.js?ver=1.4.4, line 156 character 295 - doesn't do it in ie9 or FF
[16:12:59] <Moody> i've got a question, i have a form with file input i send thrue ajax, is it possible to get the progression of the transfer ??
[16:13:09] <janthony> And the error it says is "Invalod procedure call or argument"
[16:16:31] <Moody> i've got a question, i have a form with file input i send thrue ajax, is it possible to get the progression of the transfer ?
[16:18:13] <[Joose]> If I have a div that, by default, is not displayed (display: none;), does using show() set the div to display: block?
[16:18:31] <Brodingo> yes
[16:18:49] <Moody> yes
[16:21:08] <[Joose]> So then if ( oldDiv == '.twitter-profile' && oldDiv.style.display == 'block' ) { } should only be called if .twitter-profile is visible
[16:23:20] <innociv> [Joose], is.(':visible')
[16:23:57] <[Joose]> Here's my problem: By default, .twitter-profile has display: none. When the user clicks a link, .twitter-profile is displayed using show(). When the link is clicked again, .twitter-profile is hidden using hide(). If the user clicks the link again I want .twitter-profile to be redisplayed.
[16:24:04] <innociv> You can probably just do something like if( $(this).is('visible') )
[16:24:06] <[Joose]> Nothing happens the third time I click the link though.
[16:24:23] <innociv> use toggle
[16:27:28] <janthony> Anyone have any ideas?
[16:28:02] <innociv> No idea.  Try jquery 1.6..
[16:29:08] <[Joose]> innociv: Thanks :) That's what I was looking for.
[16:29:23] <Moody> http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/socket-140484.html
[16:29:40] <statim> [Joose]:  add a class to your css: .none { display: none !important; }.  Instead of show/hide, addClass('none'), removeClass('none') and you wont have to worry about block issues
[16:30:00] <[Joose]> statim: .toggle() worked just as well.
[16:30:02] <[Joose]> Thanks though
[16:31:51] <duttonstuart> could someone show me how to clear form data in a modal box which I cant seem to sort out...  http://www.chicfreakz.co.uk/opulencebride.html
[16:32:13] <duttonstuart> I am using jquery.reveal modal plugin..
[16:32:49] <innociv> $('#contact').html('')
[16:33:03] <innociv> $('#contact input').val('')
[16:34:21] <duttonstuart> innociv.. is that about my request?
[16:34:35] <skamikaze> innociv: first delete elements, then dom query for children?
[16:34:40] <skamikaze> :)
[16:34:46] <innociv> Yes
[16:34:59] <duttonstuart> wow thanks..  where do I need to put that.. ?
[16:35:13] <innociv> Whenever you want to clear the data.  Maybe on subject
[16:35:15] <innociv> submit*
[16:35:19] <innociv> submit callback maybe
[16:35:42] <skamikaze> $('#contact').html(''); console.log( $('#contact input').length === 0 ) => true
[16:36:14] <duttonstuart> the probelm I have is that on submit it moves to a thank you page in the same modal box and when I close and reopen the box the thankyou box is still there..
[16:36:16] <skamikaze> there's nothing left to reset
[16:37:42] <antihero_> Say I have a bunch of objects, and I want to run a callback on each one. How do I do that?
[16:37:58] <antihero_> Essentially I want the object's scope inside the callback, call them $('.moo')
[16:38:20] <moo-_-> antihero_: each()?
[16:39:31] <innociv> Ajax callback is probably loading the page.
[16:40:05] <innociv> Dealing with others code is a hasstle, that's why you harge for a complete redesign.
[16:40:13] <duttonstuart> Skamikaze / innociv.. have you tried my contact form?  once its sent and closed when you go back into the form , its still on the thank you page.. I need something that resets it on close of the modal possibly??
[16:40:15] <innociv> charge*
[16:40:24] <skamikaze> antihero: you can do sth like that: http://jscouch.de/#/blog/article/id/2
[16:40:25] <innociv> I opened it but I didn't fill it out.
[16:40:36] <innociv> check the modal api for an onclose event
[16:40:46] <duttonstuart> could you fill it out to see what I mean?
[16:40:59] <duttonstuart> there is an on close event in the plugins code.
[16:41:10] <duttonstuart> I am wondering if I can bind to that somehow.??
[16:41:27] <innociv> it's hanging on loading the modal now
[16:41:37] <skamikaze> going to bed nn
[16:41:40] <innociv> Yes, that's what you'd want to do. Read its api.
[16:41:42] <antihero_> moo-_-: I think that does it
[16:41:51] <innociv> Bind if on your setter
[16:42:17] <moo-_-> antihero_: you get this pointing to each object inside each() callback
[16:42:22] <duttonstuart> as you can tell, I dont really know too much about this hence the requet for some help really..
[16:42:36] <moo-_-> antihero_: then you can pass it forward to closure function as var self = this;
[16:42:39] <moo-_-> etc.
[16:42:41] <innociv> Kay so what you're saying is if you close it and open another it opens it with the "thank you"
[16:42:47] <innociv> you want it to return to normal
[16:42:53] <ericmuyser> what's jquery's method to apply a callback to an object as an argument to an event again? so it is executed in the correct context
[16:43:00] <innociv> so easy thing to do is probably add a setter to the onclose event to reset the exact same thing
[16:43:04] <ericmuyser> i always forget this method.. i need a tattoo or something
[16:43:13] <innociv> or on close just reload the form
[16:43:36] <duttonstuart> I have found this line in the code..
[16:43:37] <duttonstuart> var closeButton = $('.' + options.dismissmodalclass).bind('click.modalEvent',closeModal)
[16:44:02] <moo-_-> ericmuyser: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[16:44:08] <duttonstuart> would I be able to do something with this to reset the form?
[16:44:23] <ericmuyser> moo-_-: thanks! >.< okay off to the tattoo shop. $.proxy
[16:44:32] <antihero_> moo-_-: cheers
[16:44:53] <duttonstuart> and would that help navigate away from the thank you php page.
[16:45:22] <KWhat_Work> is it possible to use a jquery object as a filter?  ex. myobj.parents($(this)) ?
[16:46:04] <antihero_> If I have some stuff inside an $.each(fn) is there a way to access globals
[16:46:06] <duttonstuart> <innociv> Kay so what you're saying is if you close it and open another it opens it with the "thank you"
[16:46:11] <duttonstuart> yes correct.. :)
[16:46:38] <duttonstuart> I want it to open back as a blank form again without having to refresh the page..
[16:47:04] <innociv> Copy how it's set in the onclose event
[16:48:45] <duttonstuart> var closeButton = $('.' + options.dismissmodalclass).bind('click.modalEvent',closeModal)
[16:49:01] <duttonstuart> it may be easier to link you to the reveal plugin code
[16:49:17] <duttonstuart> it uses classes..
[16:49:31] <trumpetmic> how do you stop .ui-corner-all from being applied to your dialogs?
[16:50:25] <innociv> It sounds too complex for me to look at.
[16:50:41] <innociv> anyway closeModal is a function
[16:50:42] <duttonstuart> to call the reveal it uses  <div id="contact" class="reveal-modal"> and <a class="close-reveal-modal"> to close
[16:50:49] <innociv> You need your setter in that function
[16:51:19] <innociv> But there should be something in the api to extend it on the setter instead of looking in the source code.  But you could just edit the source on the closeModal function...
[16:51:41] <trumpetmic> anyone: know how to stop .ui-corner-all from being applied to your dialogs?
[16:51:41] <trumpetmic> \
[16:51:44] <tvanover> I am using the http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/ in chrome on a input of type=date.  Now in chrome and other modern browsers it gives you an up and down selector to move through the dates.  how do I get the datepicker to update the selected date when those controls are used?
[16:52:42] <innociv> tvanover, look in the events on the jquery ui datepicker page...
[16:52:45] <innociv> it's probably change or select
[16:52:59] <duttonstuart> what would I need to add to the closemodal function to reset this?
[16:53:01] <trumpetmic> anyone?
[16:53:19] <innociv> trumpetmic, you can extend it or just put .ui-dialog { border-radius: 0 !important; } in css
[16:53:41] <trumpetmic> thanks innociv!
[16:53:47] <trumpetmic> how would you extend it?
[16:54:19] <innociv> I don't remember exactly. You're basically adding to the create dialog function to removeClass('.ui-corner-all');
[16:54:33] <innociv> You could also call removeClass('.ui-corner-all'); to the open event.
[16:54:46] <innociv> but it's easiest and fastest to add the line of css.
[16:55:28] <ch3mical> Anyone know how to disable a button on a jqUI dialog?
[16:55:29] <trumpetmic> yeah
[16:55:33] <trumpetmic> ok thanks again innociv
[16:56:12] <innociv> You could always bind a click return false to it I'd imagine.
[16:58:26] <duttonstuart> I could see that you have filled in a form ... did you get the thank you page but then when returning to the form again its still had the thank you page there?
[16:58:34] <tvanover> I'm not seeing any events for when the value of the input field changes.  I can see places where I can insert functions when the user interacts with the datepicker.  At least there is not in the events tab of http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#default as far as I can comprehend.  Is there a way watch for the input field to update and redraws the datepicker with the new current value?
[16:58:50] <antihero_> I'm new to exception handling in JS. How would I handle this exception? "Uncaught CORRUPT: ocb: tag doesn't match"
[16:59:19] <innociv> try { what throws the error } catch(error) { console.log(error) }
[16:59:35] <innociv> dutt, yes still had the thank you page.
[16:59:41] <tvanover> there is a datepicker.refesh method that should fit the bill, I just need to have it triggered when the input value changes by the user and not datepicker
[17:00:01] <duttonstuart> hmm..  just cannot think of how to get rid of it..
[17:00:39] <innociv> I can't really help any further.  You're dealing with a plugin.
[17:02:01] <ch3mical> innociv: shouldn't that be console.error(error)? ;)
[17:02:56] <innociv> Should it?  I've never used console.error()
[17:03:23] <duttonstuart> i know..  sorry innociv
[17:03:28] <duttonstuart> thanks for your advice
[17:03:43] <duttonstuart> so I may need something like this?   .bind( eventType, [ eventData ], handler(eventObject) )
[17:05:25] <innociv> No you just probably need something on your open modal setter to add an onclose event.
[17:08:26] <cos_> ben_alman: are you around?
[17:08:32] <tvanover> Any thoughts on how expand http://pastebin.com/giL4x73j so it catches an update to any of the date fields in the page (I have multiple) and update then refreshes the datepicker associated with that input?
[17:09:37] <ben_alman> cos_, not really
[17:09:42] <cos_> does somebody use BBQ Plugin by Ben Alman?
[17:09:46] <innociv> why don't you make field = $(this) and just field.datepicker()
[17:09:57] <cos_> ben_alman: :(
[17:10:11] <MistuhKurtz> fuuuu yepnope
[17:10:12] <innociv> And an each should be all you need to have it refresh them all.
[17:10:36] <innociv> You don't even need hte each though because jquery and jquery ui natively handle selector arrays
[17:10:47] <innociv> But you might need an each on your change event
[17:11:37] <cos_> ben_alman: does your BBQ Plugin support anchors? please with beef :)
[17:13:37] <tvanover>  innociv: yeah, but it still doesn't update when I change it outside the datepicker.  How would I apply the each to the change event?  This is my first day at JS and I am only certain about half of the structures I am using. :0
[17:14:18] <innociv> I have no idea.  You mean you're trying to change the input val without the datepicker?  And then you want it to do what?
[17:14:23] <duttonstuart> may need some help with the event   heres what I have..
[17:14:25] <duttonstuart>  $("theModal").bind('closeModal',function(){
[17:15:05] <duttonstuart> $('contact').clearform('contactus');
[17:15:36] <duttonstuart> I would really appreciate if someone could help me sort out this small bit of code...
[17:15:38] <tvanover> the user types in the box while the date picker is open, or uses the next day/prev day buttons in inputs of type date
[17:16:12] <duttonstuart> I just need to clear the form and the get away from the thank youpage on submit.. in a modal box..
[17:16:42] <duttonstuart> its been driving me crazy on and off for weeks. :S
[17:16:59] <cos_> ciao
[17:18:09] <tvanover> especially the next/prev buttons, since when you click on it forces the input box to be selected and pops up the datepicker.  But even though the field value changes the datepicker stays on the previously selected day.  It is comes across as a ui glitch, but one I will be called on.
[17:19:22] <antihero_> How do I prevent a form submitting with preventDefault?
[17:19:57] <antihero_> Doing $('#reply-button').click(function(e){e.preventDefault();}); doesn't seem to work
[17:20:03] <eddiemonge> $('form').submit(function(e){e.preventDefault(); });
[17:20:20] <eddiemonge> antihero_: that prevents the click button from doing its default thing
[17:21:05] <duttonstuart> I would really appreciate if someone could help me sort out this small bit of code...
[17:21:08] <duttonstuart> I just need to clear the form and the get away from the thank youpage on submit.. in a modal box..
[17:21:18] <duttonstuart> its been driving me crazy on and off for weeks. :S
[17:21:22] <antihero_> ah got it!
[17:21:25] <antihero_> eddiemonge: form.submit()
[17:22:17] <eddiemonge> duttonstuart: stop doing it in an iframe and itll be so much easier
[17:23:13] <duttonstuart> thanks.. could you suggest a better way?
[17:24:04] <eddiemonge> not doing it in an iframe
[17:24:21] <duttonstuart> could i just call the php in the html markup?
[17:24:30] <duttonstuart> and then add a class to it?
[17:24:47] <eddiemonge> do you mean could you load the html markup generated by php in the modal popup?
[17:25:01] <duttonstuart> yes
[17:25:29] <eddiemonge> yes
[17:25:59] <RobW> wtf
[17:26:11] <blindMoe> ftw
[17:26:13] <RobW> if i'm in $(document).ready(function() { }) I can't call functions outside that?
[17:26:42] <RobW> function blah() { alert('boo'); } $(document).ready(function() { blah(); }); returns blah not defined
[17:27:44] <RobW> hm jsfiddle shows it does
[17:27:46] <blindMoe> http://jsfiddle.net/4gUn5/
[17:27:47] <RobW> why cant i get it to wrk
[17:28:03] <RobW> oh
[17:28:04] <blindMoe> maybe because jsfiddle is wrapping all of it in onLoad
[17:28:06] <RobW> forgot to include the scripts file
[17:28:12] <blindMoe> haha
[17:28:15] <blindMoe> that would do it
[17:28:16] <RobW> damnit
[17:28:30] <duttonstuart> would I need to pull in the full PHP code into my html or could I call it?
[17:28:35] <RobW> you'd be surprised how often I do that..
[17:28:37] <Edler> hey guys
[17:28:44] <Edler> is there a way to callback a function once a $.each is over
[17:28:44] <Edler> ?
[17:29:07] <eddiemonge> duttonstuart: you are new to php?
[17:29:10] <RobW> Edler: check the .length
[17:29:27] <duttonstuart> quite new..  i'm afraid
[17:29:35] <antihero_> If I've overridden a form's submit(), how do I then submit the form?
[17:29:51] <eddiemonge> duttonstuart: youre php generates HTML markup that is then delivered to the browser.
[17:29:58] <RobW> $totalItems = $('.sel').length; $('.sel').each(function(i) { /* do stuff with $(this) */ if(i == totalItems) { alert('done!'); } });
[17:30:12] <RobW> antihero_: $("form").submit()
[17:30:23] <antihero_> RobW: Cheers.
[17:31:45] <duttonstuart> I could put <?php then my php code .. in my main page ?
[17:32:37] <duttonstuart> then ?> to close it off in the html
[17:33:40] <eddiemonge> duttonstuart: read this http://devzone.zend.com/node/view/id/627
[17:33:49] <duttonstuart> the iframe was the easy way to pull in the php
[17:34:50] <eddiemonge> duttonstuart: get "pull in the php" out of your head. you are pulling html content. php is backend development. html and jquery are front end.
[17:35:19] <eddiemonge> when working with things in the browser, you are working with the front end code. how the code is generated isnt so important
[17:35:34] <eddiemonge> what is important is the generated code that you work with
[17:35:41] <duttonstuart> thanks
[17:37:06] <eddiemonge> so "how do i put code in my modal popup?" is a separate question from "how do I generate code to deliver to the front end to put in a modal popup?". does that make sense?
[17:37:49] <antihero_> What JavaScript markdown libraries are nicely compatible with JQuery?
[17:38:45] <eddiemonge> ?G javascript markdown libraries
[17:38:46] <bot-t> eddiemonge, web development - Is there any good Markdown Javascript library or ... - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/134235/is-there-any-good-markdown-javascript-library-or-control
[17:40:54] <duttonstuart> yes.. that makes sense EddieMonge
[17:41:30] <lorin> How would I use the animate function to create a curved animation?
[17:41:41] <lorin> eg. not just linear x/y but on a spline?
[17:43:03] <khaan> hey everybody
[17:43:24] <palhmbs> how do I compare an jQuery object to a string ( I want to find out if it contains a specific class) -- active = links.index(jQuery(this)); if (active = 'a.support-contracts') {
[17:43:42] <duttonstuart> I will have a good read through what you have sent me ..  can you have a look at my page again and see if I have made sense with the PHP ?
[17:44:16] <khaan> question: do you know of an easy plugin to give a div a scale-on-mouseover property? and if there is, scaling up messes up text and images?
[17:44:38] <eddiemonge> palhmbs: what exactly is it you want to compare?
[17:44:47] <eddiemonge> duttonstuart: i dont know what your page is
[17:45:03] <duttonstuart> the url is http://chicfreakz.co.uk/navigation2.html but the contact page is a modal popup in About us.. under contact
[17:45:07] <eddiemonge> khaan: you mean zoom?
[17:45:09] <palhmbs> it's a link a.support-contract jquery object
[17:45:20] <khaan> eddiemonge: exactly
[17:45:50] <palhmbs> basically I want to find out the active slider and then add a class to another object in the page.
[17:46:21] <eddiemonge> duttonstuart: you should upgrade your jquery version
[17:46:48] <eddiemonge> palhmbs: put a class on the active one and then just search for that class
[17:46:52] <palhmbs> I think http://api.jquery.com/is/ is what I need....
[17:46:58] <duttonstuart> I will thankyou..
[17:48:06] <eddiemonge> duttonstuart: that is way to much code to go through
[17:48:56] <eddiemonge> duttonstuart: $('<div />').load('/contact/contactform.php #contactus').dialog(optionsGoHere)
[17:53:16] <khaan> eddiemonge: any clue for my zoom issue? :D
[17:54:01] <eddiemonge> khaan: nope. im not a fan of stuff zooming in
[17:54:17] <khaan> eddiemonge: thank you anyway :)
[17:54:33] <duttonstuart> ok EddieMonge.. Thanks put in what you mentioned..  can you just check my page again to see if thats right?
[17:55:15] <duttonstuart> http://www.chicfreakz.co.uk/navigation2.html
[17:56:12] <eddiemonge> duttonstuart: i still see the iframe
[17:57:58] <duttonstuart> yep try it now.. I have done something wrong.. as it doesnt show. the modal box pops up but its empty
[17:58:59] <eddiemonge> duttonstuart: might be time to hire a web developer
[18:00:34] <duttonstuart> thanks for your advice but trying to learn as i go..  first one I have tried..
[18:01:13] <duttonstuart> I know I need to learn lots but trial by error is best way for me to pick things up..
[18:01:44] <eddiemonge> duttonstuart: is this your site? did you inherit it?
[18:02:41] <duttonstuart> Its my friends site.. I have started their site all over again as it was a drupal site which looked very boring..
[18:03:09] <eddiemonge> maybe you should start it from scratch with no JS and get it looking right and working correctly
[18:03:13] <duttonstuart> I have used some tutorial coding and free soruced coding.  and trying to just learn about things as I go..
[18:03:19] <eddiemonge> then add the JS in to make it more "flashy"
[18:03:49] <duttonstuart> writing it in raw html so that I can learn from my mistakes rather than use a web editing program
[18:07:08] <duttonstuart> understand..  This is the kind of thing that I need to take on board, I have added things to it as and when I have seen them .. rather than build the basic structure and then beef it up.. bad move on my part I guess.. but big learning curve I suppose..
[18:10:15] <Assimilater> hey all, i'm having issues with this slider: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/2U4mv/
[18:10:17] <Assimilater> i'm trying to make it so that
[18:10:28] <Assimilater> the index on the slider makes a day of the week appear on the span
[18:10:33] <Assimilater> it works perfectly when you use the buttons
[18:10:35] <Assimilater> but not when you "slide"
[18:10:48] <Assimilater> it's almost as if the index changes
[18:11:45] <eddiemonge> duttonstuart: im afraid the learning curve might have been too high on this one
[18:12:31] <Newbiathon_> hey guys, I want to use jquery to manage page content. i want my links to change the content of a my content <div>. Is my best bet using event.target and hide,show, etc..
[18:12:55] <Newbiathon_> like for home contact about etc..
[18:13:06] <Newbiathon_> or should i also use php?
[18:14:11] <Assimilater> just noticed...it doesn't appear to register the getNums function in the jsfiddle like it does on the live site :S
[18:14:14] <Assimilater> attempting to fix
[18:18:09] <ngharo> Assimilater: http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/2U4mv/3/ it works?
[18:18:38] <ngharo> also http://i.imgur.com/ljTK5.gif
[18:18:48] * ngharo wiggles
[18:20:45] <Newbiathon_> anyone help with my question?
[18:20:52] <Assimilater> ngharo: not quite, notice when you use the arrows to go to the far left, then you slide right it offsets it by one
[18:21:00] <Assimilater> notice it says saturday, saturday
[18:34:25] <ngharo> Assimilater: http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/2U4mv/4/
[18:37:20] <Assimilater> looks like you arrived at the same conclusion as me
[18:37:23] <Assimilater> sorry i wasn't looking :S
[18:37:31] <ngharo> min at 0?
[18:37:52] <ngharo> i think that was the root cause
[18:38:12] <Assimilater> actually it's that the value doesn't change while it's sliding
[18:38:17] <Assimilater> the 0 was a typo
[18:38:21] <Assimilater> and it only affected the first load
[18:39:00] <Newbiathon_> hey guys, what is the way to make a list of links: home, about, contact, etc.. change the contents of a div box
[18:39:15] <Newbiathon_> i know this also will involve php
[18:39:49] <Assimilater> like with ajax?
[18:39:55] <Assimilater> lookup .load and see if it answers your question
[18:41:11] <Newbiathon_> yeah, but i guess i wouldn't have to use ajax
[18:41:28] <Newbiathon_> looks like you can just use .hide, .trigger etc..
[18:41:40] <Newbiathon_> but hide still takes up that space
[18:53:00] <sholmes> what's the point of .prop?
[18:53:14] <sholmes> I can just use document.someprop = 'something';
[18:53:33] <sholmes> Why would I want to do $(document).prop('someprop', 'something');?
[18:54:25] <systemfault> Well.. easy.
[18:54:31] <shesek> sholmes, you could say that about a lot of things... why would you use attr(), css(), width(), etc ?
[18:54:47] <systemfault> 1) You don't need to unwrap the nodes 2) It provides normalization between browsers.
[18:55:01] <sholmes> shesek: those other things use less typing.
[18:55:06] <shesek> it makes it easier to use it with jQuery objects, enables chaining, and probably solves some cross-browser computability issues
[18:55:28] <sholmes> Yeah, I just thought about those reasons.
[18:55:43] <shesek> blahs
[18:55:57] <shesek> xchat spelling suggestions fail
[18:56:19] <shesek> * compatibility
[18:57:02] <sholmes> didn't know xchat had spelling suggest
[18:57:30] <shesek> I think the Windows version doesn't
[18:57:53] <shesek> but here it has a red line thingy underneath the word, the right click menu has an 'Spelling Suggestions' submenu
[18:58:32] <sholmes> I have the windows version
[18:58:35] <sholmes> well it's YChat
[18:58:38] <sholmes> the free one
[18:59:11] <shesek> a precompiled version of xchat?
[18:59:57] <ngharo> pfft ZChat is where it's at
[19:05:00] <RobW> I have storage[useClass] = $("#s-slider ul").detach();
[19:05:09] <RobW> how do I set the html back from storage[useClass] ?
[19:05:25] <RobW> tried: $("#s-slider ul").html(storage[useClass].html());
[19:05:31] <RobW> tried: $("#s-slider ul").html($(storage[useClass]).html());
[19:05:39] <RobW> tried: $("#s-slider ul").html(storage[useClass]);
[19:06:27] <RobW> tried: $("#s-slider ul").html($(storage[useClass]));
[19:06:32] <RobW> i'm otu of ideas!
[19:06:44] <RobW> http://pastebin.com/Q1rPL1Jt
[19:06:56] <systemfault> Why would it be .html?
[19:07:02] <systemfault> Does it even make sense?
[19:07:34] <systemfault> RobW: Anyway... try append.
[19:09:33] <Newbiathon_> can you style the buttons in jquery?
[19:10:15] <Newbiathon_> like can i make a custom button and use it to do a jquery task?
[19:10:46] <systemfault> Yes.. kind of stupid though.
[19:10:58] <systemfault> Styling should be done with a stylesheet, not javascript.
[19:12:17] <Newbiathon_> yeah i know css is for styling
[19:12:33] <Newbiathon_> i just want to make my links to change the content section
[19:12:47] <Newbiathon_> and don't want my links to look like buttons
[19:12:59] <Newbiathon_> i want a nav menu
[19:13:00] <RobW> wtf.
[19:13:02] <RobW> not working
[19:13:03] <systemfault> Then style them appropriately
[19:13:16] <systemfault> RobW: Write a jsfiddle test :/
[19:13:38] <RobW> too much to do jsfiddle
[19:13:47] <Newbiathon_> button.whatever {     }
[19:13:54] <Newbiathon_> to make a class?
[19:14:26] <systemfault> RobW: You could have done a 10 lines testcase :/
[19:15:22] <RobW> eh not for what i'm doing
[19:16:23] <bobbobbins> hey, i have an issue...here is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/jebcL/  if you look where it defines variation one...if i alert data.metric[0].METRIC_DATA_VALUE it has the right value...but when i call my chart and use that value...nothing is there
[19:20:26] <RobW> systemfault: http://tiny.cc/2lav9 - click on the [+] on the first slide, then click big right arrow.. click on [+] then click on big LEFT arrow.. then click on [+]
[19:20:34] <RobW> notice how the carousel just.. *disappears*
[19:20:44] <RobW> this is all happening in function onAfter
[19:21:25] <RobW> basically, once you go back to a slide that was open after visiting another slide, it no longer works
[19:21:35] <RobW> i've used detach() and yielded same results.. why doesn't this just.. work..
[19:22:55] <systemfault> Ah right
[19:23:11] <RobW> $("#pImgs").find("li." + useClass).length seems to keep returning 0 wtf
[19:23:22] <RobW> it's clearly in the dom..
[19:26:08] <RobW> systemfault: any ideas.. ?
[19:26:13] <systemfault> Checking
[19:26:15] <RobW> seems that $("#s-slider ul").html($("#pImgs").find("li." + useClass)); is failing
[19:26:49] <RobW> hell, in firebug it's not even inserting the UL
[19:27:27] <RobW> if I use .detach() the UL will get inserted, but no LI's still.. if I use .remove() the UL will not get inserted..
[19:31:04] <ryanseddon> RobW: you got a fiddle to show what you're talking about?
[19:31:25] <RobW> no
[19:31:33] <RobW> i posted link to site.
[19:31:54] <RobW> ryanseddon: http://tiny.cc/2lav9 - click on the [+] on the first slide, then click big right arrow.. click on [+] then click on big LEFT arrow.. then click on [+]
[19:32:16] <shesek> setting the inner html of a <ul> to the inner html of an <li> makes no sense
[19:32:56] <RobW> I just want to copy those LI's over
[19:33:07] <shesek> plus, you should pass html to html(), not an element
[19:33:08] <RobW> from the looks of firebug, it's removing it from the bottom UL
[19:33:09] <ryanseddon> you can clone them
[19:33:17] <shesek> than use append() or something, using html() makes no sense
[19:33:37] <RobW> oh got it
[19:33:38] <RobW> .clone..
[19:33:50] <RobW> how is that removing it from the original location though?!
[19:34:07] <RobW> FIXED: $("#s-slider ul").html($("#pImgs").find("li." + useClass).clone()); -- OLD: $("#s-slider ul").html($("#pImgs").find("li." + useClass)); -- how is this removing the li.USECLASS from #pImpgs?
[19:40:43] <sodapop> having an , after the last item of an object caused problem in ie7 but not ie8 firefox chrome
[19:47:23] <ryanseddon> thats because jscript in ie7 does not forgive but others do
[19:48:11] <italic> if want to execute a callback on my selected element, is .each() correct, or is there a singualr version?
[19:50:58] <xxiao> hi i want to put some variable inside div/span and update it automatically each second...is it possible?
[19:51:28] <jstr> Yes, use setInterval(function() { ... }, 1000);
[19:51:46] <jstr> and inside the function put your jQuery to update the div/span HTML
[19:52:40] <xxiao> jstr: i need set an id for span then use seletor get grab that id and assign this value as html right?
[19:52:47] <mrmccrac> wow, came here to ask a question and i think i just realized my stupid mistake
[19:52:54] * xxiao is new to jquery
[19:53:02] <coldhead> me too, xxiao
[19:53:05] <coldhead> it's my first day
[19:53:29] <jstr> xxiao: yes, you need to set a selector, like <div id="my_id">..</div>
[19:53:44] <Aple> Hey, can someone tell me how to get jQuery to animate something hidden to the right like slideDown does... only... from left edge of screen to middle of viewport exactly?
[19:53:45] <Aple> http://i.imgur.com/4Lrbm.jpg
[19:53:45] <jstr> then use jquery like so: $('div#my_id').html("new content");
[19:54:24] <xxiao> jstr:thanks!
[19:54:31] <jstr> np
[19:56:32] <mrmccrac> very easy to get a tab-based ui up and running, im impressed :P
[20:09:42] <Aple> Can jQueryUI load two functions at once? I'm trying this code: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/407947/ and it's sliding #blue_box in from the right, and after it completes it's animation, #green_box teleports to it's ending location.
[20:10:00] <Aple> Is there a way I can wrap both those functions in a function, then call that function?
[20:14:47] <sholmes> should I use .get(0) or [0]?
[20:14:55] <AquaGen> help! not working: $("[contentindex=(parseInt($(this).attr("headerindex")))+'c']").slideDown();
[20:15:20] <AquaGen> ((parseInt($(this).attr("headerindex")))+'c') = 0c
[20:15:33] <AquaGen> $("div[contentindex|=0c]").slideDown(); - working
[20:15:43] <AquaGen> $("[contentindex=(parseInt($(this).attr("headerindex")))+'c']").slideDown(); - not
[20:19:42] <shesek> AquaGen, you do know that the '(parseInt($(this).attr("headerindex")))' part is treated as a string, right?
[20:20:19] <shesek> you can't put function calls inside a quoted string
[20:24:07] <AquaGen> how then get 0c?
[20:25:55] <shesek> You should probably read a javascript tutorial and have some basic understand of how strings and string concatenation works before trying to write code
[20:27:00] <AquaGen> $([contentindex=((parseInt($(this).attr("headerindex")))+'c')]).slideDown(); - not working
[20:27:03] <ryanseddon> AquaGen: $("[contentindex=" + (parseInt($(this).attr("headerindex")),10) + "c]")
[20:27:18] <shesek> sholmes, correctly its exactly the same, other than [0] being slightly faster, but I would recommend you to use .get(0) in-case the way jQuery stores it changes and they add some other logic to get(0)
[20:27:47] <shesek> ryanneufeld, ",10" ?
[20:27:51] <shesek> where did that come from? oO
[20:28:04] <ryanseddon> oops that should be $("[contentindex=" + (parseInt($(this).attr("headerindex"),10)) + "c]")
[20:28:16] <ryanseddon> parseInt should alwyas have it's radix
[20:28:27] <sholmes> shesek: ok. thx
[20:28:56] <shesek> blah, s/correctly/currently
[20:29:02] * shesek 's native language isn't English
[20:29:14] <ryanseddon> parseInt(01) would be interpreted as an octal number
[20:29:38] <ryanseddon> parseInt(01,10) would tell it that you want base10 numbers
[20:30:41] <AquaGen> ryanseddon: thanks
[20:36:19] <colin3440> I'm passing a bunch of variables into a string to pass with $.get but some of them contain & characters and that's causing problems. What can I do about that?
[20:37:38] <shesek> colin3440, either encode them yourself (see escape() and encodeURIComponent()) or pass them as an object/dictionary to jQuery and let it handle it
[20:39:24] <colin3440> thanks shesek!
[20:39:51] <shesek> you welcome
[20:49:07] <xxiao> when i define a var in jquery's function, is it cleared whenever i reload the page/
[20:50:05] <jonathansampson> xxiao If you need to persist a variable, use a jQuery cookie plugin.
[20:50:22] <jonathansampson> Or store the variable in SESSION.
[20:51:02] <xxiao> jonathansampson: ok...spoiled by the 'static var myVar' :)
[20:51:12] <jonathansampson> http://code.appendto.com/plugins/jquery-jsoncookie/docs
[20:51:26] <jonathansampson> Check out JSON Cookie, a new plugin released from "The jQuery Company," appendTo().
[20:51:56] <xxiao> in my $.ajax(success: function(html) {...how do I parse html here }?
[20:52:23] <jonathansampson> The HTML var will be your returned data. $(html).find("p");
[20:52:28] <xxiao> say if I know there is a div id=myId in the html(returned by ajax), can i do ${"myId"}?
[20:52:41] <jonathansampson> $("#myID", html).doSomething();
[20:52:51] <xxiao> i c, treat html as an object, thanks!
[20:53:19] <jonathansampson> You're welcome, xxiao.
[20:58:46] <colin3440> okay now I'm trying to pass "8+" with get and it's being received as just "8 " even when I escape it
[20:59:05] <jonathansampson> colin3440 Pass it where?
[21:00:13] <colin3440> jonathansampson: to a php file with $.getJSON
[21:00:44] <jonathansampson> colin3440 Is your code available online someplace?
[21:10:47] <TuRnc04tZ> hey guys, is anyone here familiar with a lib called jscrollpane?
[21:11:28] <TuRnc04tZ> It seems that if you have a modular window, and put jscrollpane inside that modular window which loads an iframe, in IE it does not work (found this ex online: http://www.creativepreviews.com/test/jscrollpane.html)
[21:13:56] <xxiao> jonathansampson: in ajax success(html){ $(":contains(mykeyboard)",html).something()}, is the selector right?
[21:14:38] <xxiao> i could not find a reference on the html parser yet
[21:15:18] <krz> whats http://www.pubnub.com/ using for its top nav (yellow) on hover
[21:15:21] <xxiao> need find the <p> line that contains "mykeyboard" in html returned by ajax and assign it to a value
[21:17:13] <ryanseddon> ?contains @ xxiao
[21:17:39] <ryanseddon> stupid bot
[21:18:04] <shesek> xxiao, $(document.createElement('div')).html(html_returned_from_ajax).find('p:contains(mykeyboard)')
[21:19:10] <shesek> xxiao, you'll have to assign that HTML to a DOM element first, than search in that
[21:19:35] <xxiao> and the value can be assigned to a var?
[21:19:56] <ryanseddon> you can just put the returned html string into a jquery object $(ajax_data)
[21:20:14] <shesek> the value of what?
[21:20:30] <shesek> the text in the <p> element ?
[21:20:31] <xxiao> the value of the p line i searched
[21:20:39] <shesek> oh, right, jQuery
[21:21:08] <shesek> oh, right, jQuery's $() supports getting HTML as an argument and create a DOM element for that
[21:21:11] <shesek> but it won't work well if you have multiple top-level elements IIRC
[21:21:16] <xxiao> i got a html response at ajax.success(function(htmlx)), and need grab a few p lines from that and assign them to variables
[21:22:07] <xxiao> after assigning them to variables, i can then display/update them on certain areas every few seconds
[21:22:09] <shesek> xxiao, by value you mean what? the actual DOM element? the text contents? the inner HTML?
[21:22:09] <shesek> well, actually, whatever the answer is... yes, you can
[21:22:42] <xxiao> the text content of that p line
[21:23:00] <xxiao> it's dynamic, it's a data i read via ajax
[21:23:29] <shesek> well, yes, you can, just call text() on the <p> element returned from find() and do whatever you want with the returned string
[21:23:39] <xxiao> every 10 seconds i invoke ajax, which returns a html with a few p lines, those p lines are texts(data)
[21:24:10] <xxiao> i then assign those p lines to variables, then use html() to display them locally
[21:25:18] <xxiao> $(document.createElement('div')).html(html_returned_from_ajax).find('p:contains(mykeyboard)') is making a div right?
[21:25:25] <TuRnc04tZ> <TuRnc04tZ> It seems that if you have a modular window, and put jscrollpane inside that modular window which loads an iframe, in IE it does not work (ex. http://www.victorpassapera.com click on -> about)
[21:25:27] <xxiao> but i only need the text content of it
[21:25:30] <TuRnc04tZ> anyone please?
[21:25:37] <TuRnc04tZ> i've been troubleshooting this for a while
[21:26:26] <shesek> TuRnc04tZ, I would ask jscrollpane developer about that
[21:26:42] <shesek> I highly doubt someone here could help you
[21:26:44] <cups> hey guys, can someone explain why this function stops after 2:  $(document).ready(function(){ var myNum = 1;   function change(){ myNum++;         $('#myBox').replaceWith(String(myNum));    } setInterval(change, 1000);  })
[21:27:00] <TuRnc04tZ> well, maybe if i post the functions someone could pinpoint the error, hold on let me make a pastie
[21:27:07] <TuRnc04tZ> is everyone else getting the error tho?
[21:27:11] <TuRnc04tZ> on IE at least?
[21:27:18] <TuRnc04tZ> i didnt notice it till today cause i use linux
[21:27:20] <TuRnc04tZ> :/
[21:27:30] <TuRnc04tZ> in a perfect world we wouldnt have to worry about this lol
[21:28:24] <shesek> cups, no idea, but you shouldn't use replaceWith() to set the text contents
[21:28:27] <shesek> that's meant for replacing it with another DOM element
[21:28:32] <shesek> use text() instead, and no need for that String()
[21:28:43] <cups> ooh i think that's the problem
[21:28:47] <colin3440> how do you check if an array is empty?
[21:29:06] <cups> when should you use text()   vs  html()
[21:29:10] <shesek> coldhead, arr.length==0
[21:29:20] <colin3440> thanks again!
[21:29:29] <shesek> sure
[21:29:43] <shesek> cups, well, you use html() when you set the HTML contents, and text() when its plain text
[21:29:59] <cups> shesek, thanks for the help I appreciate it
[21:30:20] <coldhead> thanks shesek
[21:30:23] <shesek> For example, if your text is "Did you know that 1<3?", using html() won't work because the '<' would be treated as html
[21:31:05] <shesek> and using text('<strong>Foobar</strong>') would just display that as a text, it won't actually use a <strong> tag
[21:32:00] <shesek> like setting the html to &lt;strong&gt;....
[21:32:29] <xxiao> shesek: can I do var myVar=$(document.createElement('div')).html.find('p:contains(mykeyboard)'); ?
[21:32:50] <xxiao> sorry i'm a newbie here
[21:33:57] <shesek> you should pass the HTML returned from the AJAX request to the html() method... but other than that, sure, why not?
[21:34:03] <shesek> just like you would assign anything else to a variable
[21:37:19] <xxiao> hmm
[21:38:13] <xxiao> thanks though i still am not sure if my syntax is correct or not
[21:38:59] <xxiao> i googled hard, found nothing on this, but really, ajax-returns-html-then-needs-parse should be common, right
[21:40:16] <shesek> it doesn't seem like a correct design, you would usually set the server-side code to return only the data you need
[21:40:26] <shesek> instead of filtering it with client-side code
[21:41:21] <xxiao> shesek: i agree
[21:41:50] <xxiao> but in my case it's hard to modify the cgi
[21:41:59] <xxiao> which is a binary from other places
[21:42:51] <xxiao> besides the server returns quite a few data items ...
[21:43:14] <shesek> well, anyhow, what you wrote seems correct, other than what I already said (that you should actually call the html method and pass an argument to it)
[21:43:30] <shesek> and that you might want to get the text (by appending .text() to it after the find() call) instead of the jQuery object returned from find()
[21:45:34] <xxiao> myVar=$(document.createElement('div')).html.find('p:contains(mykeyboard)').text(); ?
[21:46:03] <xxiao> or something better? i dont know how to call the html method and pass arg to it,
[21:46:15] <xxiao> html is not clear here, let me assume the message is the one returned by ajax
[21:46:34] <xxiao> myVar=$(document.createElement('div')).message.find('p:contains(mykeyboard)').text();
[21:46:50] <ryanseddon> xxiao: myVar=$(document.createElement('div')).html(ajax_data_goes_here).find('p:contains(mykeyboard)')
[21:47:29] <xxiao> thanks guys, let me try
[21:50:33] <yun> Hi, I encountered an odd thing when I adding a element with jquery in writing a google chrome extension. I use the content_scripts to specify the stylesheet. It is OK for the static elements with the stylesheet. But the style specified in the stylesheet would not be applied to new elements created with Jquery.
[21:53:25] <yun> Does anybody have the same experience?
[22:05:21] <xxiao> is there a way to check jquery/javascript syntax, it's hard to see if some brackets are missing
[22:05:33] <xxiao> i do use firebug
[22:06:08] <Hierofant> I use an editor which indents and also temp-bolds braces
[22:06:44] <Hierofant> so you can see the pair when you hover or type next to one of them
[22:08:16] <sholmes> is this in event handlers $(this) or $(this).get(0)?
[22:09:24] <sholmes> you know is it necessary to do $(this) in event handlers in order to get at the jQuery object of the element?
[22:17:15] <ryanseddon> sholmes: you can also check event.target
[22:17:35] <ryanseddon> but $(this) is the better route
[22:17:37] <sholmes> ryanseddon, yeah, but `this` is less type.
[22:20:40] <bobbobbins> hey, i keep getting undefined errors...im doing a loop and there are 3 items in my array, but the loop goes on 4 times...how can I check to see if a variable is defined or not?
[22:21:17] <ryanseddon> paste your code
[22:22:49] <bobbobbins> http://jsfiddle.net/22PaG/ i guess theres no real jquery here, but most of the script uses it
[22:23:30] <ryanseddon> set the loop length to be array.length
[22:24:43] <ryanseddon> for(var i = 0,len=array.length; i < len; i++) // like that
[22:27:24] <bobbobbins> ryanseddon: that seems to have worked, but no data is displaying in my graph...i better paste the whole thing
[22:27:57] <bobbobbins> http://jsfiddle.net/22PaG/1/
[22:28:43] <bobbobbins> the problem is that data: isn't getting the data it needs...i initially had it data: [data.metric[0].METRIC_DATA_VALUE, data.metric[1].METRIC_DATA_VALUE]
[22:28:55] <bobbobbins> but that didn't seem to work...so now i tried it this way...and its not working here either
[22:29:25] <bobbobbins> maybe i should ask this in javascript instead of jquery
[22:32:47] <ryanseddon> bobbobbins: are you accessing the array properly?
[22:33:41] <ryanseddon> by the way graqph_data shoudl be an array not an object
[22:33:51] <ryanseddon> you've defined it as an object
[22:34:12] <ryanseddon> should be graph_data = []
[22:34:37] <ohboy> yeah
[22:38:29] <bobbobbins> ryanseddon, ah, well that kind of helps...at least its showing 3 items in the array, but im still not getting any data...i think im accessing the array properly...just passing data: graph_data should do it, right?
[22:39:05] <ryanseddon> can you create a fake array item in you fiddle to show whats happening
[22:39:16] <bobbobbins> ok, lemmie try that
[22:43:47] <cups> hey how do I convert a large number to display with commas?
[22:44:18] <dtach> i get the following line from my external page http://jsfiddle.net/PmkuK/ is there a way to wrap all the times with a div (so each gets <div>00:00</div>?
[22:46:28] <bobbobbins> if i set the values in the array, it works...so the problem must be with data.metric[0].METRIC_DATA_VALUE. but if display it in an alert, i get a value.
[22:49:36] <bobbobbins> ah, figured it out...i have to use eval()
[22:49:50] <ryanseddon> gah don't use eval
[22:50:20] <bobbobbins> what should i use instead?
[22:50:41] <bobbobbins> i got the idea from here: http://www.json.org/js.html
[22:51:42] <bobbobbins> JSON.parse?
[22:54:24] <research4oscar> is there a way to have a website, say for example http://google.com within a dialog box?
[22:54:53] <ohboy> why would you want to do that?
[22:54:54] <ohboy> that's the question
[22:55:02] <ohboy> what exactly do you want to do?
[22:55:43] <research4oscar> I've created some reports and am running them from a different webserver. I have a link but it opens up in a new browser.
[22:55:58] <Jantire> Is there a losesFocus() event in jQuery, the reverse of click()?
[22:56:39] <research4oscar> I was thinking that upon clicking a link, I could display the report within the dialog instead.
[22:56:57] <research4oscar> this way they do not see that it is a different addess.
[22:57:00] <ohboy> research4oscar: you can read in the html from a page using jquery
[22:57:01] <dtach> Jantire: mouseup?
[22:57:24] <dtach> Jantire: The mouseup event is sent to an element when the mouse pointer is over the element, and the mouse button is released.
[22:57:42] <Jantire> does that work for under too?
[22:57:48] <Jantire> or would that be mouseunder()
[22:57:55] <dtach> under?
[22:58:17] <research4oscar> ohboy: read in html from a page using jquery?  what should i be searching for in the jquery api?
[22:58:26] <Jantire> I want it to be so when the mouse is no longer hovering, or the element looses focus that a function is called
[22:58:29] <Nolok> mousedown
[22:59:16] <Jantire> alrgiht
[22:59:26] <research4oscar> ohboy: perhaps: http://api.jquery.com/html/
[22:59:31] <dtach> i get the following line from my external page http://jsfiddle.net/PmkuK/ is there a way to wrap all the times with a div (so each gets <div>00:00</div>?
[23:02:02] <Tant102> I would like to render custom dom nodes in a jquery.tmpl template. I'm currently using a function that returns a string, containg a div with unique id. This function also calls setTimout to later grab the div and transform it. This sounds hackish. What's the correct way to do it?
[23:02:10] <Jantire> Why won't this #assignment_selector fadeIn? http://3jvq.localtunnel.com
[23:02:33] <Jantire> just make an account
[23:05:46] <Jantire> Any help?
[23:07:05] <Tant102> You lost me at "just make an account".
[23:07:54] <Jantire> alright sign in with - sample_user@example.com and sampleuser123
[23:09:47] <Tant102> "Invalid email or password"
[23:10:25] <Brojo> I have an on "mouseenter" event, but if the mouse is already over the element while the page is loading, it won't trigger unless I got outside of the element and then back in
[23:10:29] <Brojo> any way to fix this?
[23:10:43] <Tant102> mousemove?
[23:10:47] <Tant102> mouseover?
[23:13:14] <ohboy> Brojo: i don't really see the problem with that
[23:13:56] <Brojo> it's not much of a problem, but I'd like to fix it
[23:14:08] <ohboy> i guess you could always do it so that hovering over the element gives it a class
[23:14:14] <Tant102> ...
[23:14:14] <ohboy> and on page load
[23:14:20] <Tant102> Use mousemove or mouseover instead.
[23:14:21] <ohboy> you can check to see if the element has a class
[23:14:29] <Tant102> Mouseenter _only_ triggers when entering.
[23:14:47] <Tant102> ?mouseover @Brojo
[23:14:51] <Tant102> ...
[23:14:52] <Brojo> Tant102 - mousemove corrupts the function, and mouseover has the same issue
[23:15:04] <Tant102> corrupts the function?
[23:15:26] <Brojo> there is a setInterval animation inside of it, and mousemove calls the function every time the mouse moves
[23:15:53] <Brojo> and mouseover doesn't process that the mouse is over the element unless I go out of the element and back in
[23:15:56] <Brojo> same as mouseenter
[23:16:03] <Tant102> Sounds like a simple case of calling setInterval only once, and clear it when exiting.
[23:17:01] <Brojo> I do that - but I just tested the page with mouseover and it has weird behavior
[23:17:08] <Brojo> mousemove*
[23:18:12] <Brojo> I was mainly wondering if there was something I could reset on page load that allows the mouseenter or mouseover to be triggered in the beginning
[23:18:21] <Tant102> Set a flag on mousemove, and clear it on mouseleave.
[23:18:32] <Tant102> That way you will implement the only-execute-once-idea.
[23:19:29] <Brojo> mousemove calls the function literally every time the mouse moves at all within an element
[23:20:45] <Brojo> but I think I'm figuring it out... it has something to do with this image
[23:26:41] <xxiao> tempDisplay1=$(document.createElement('div')).html(msgx).find('#up_outlet_power')
[23:26:56] <xxiao> can I use "find" that way to select based on id?
[23:27:10] <xxiao> somehow it does not work
[23:27:46] <xxiao> tempDisplay1=$(document.createElement('div')).html(msgx).find('p:contains(top outlet)') does work
[23:36:16] <daffodil> Hello all
[23:37:41] <daffodil> i am trying to one page navigation.similar to this http://trevordavis.net/play/jquery-one-page-nav/. The problem here is in my 16inches screen,i get the pages correctly.in bigger screens m seeing first page and second page.
[23:37:52] <daffodil> How to resolve this problem?
[23:38:24] <GoGoGarrett> You could perhaps try to use media queries with css to manage the width of the browser and manage the site accordingly
[23:39:50] <daffodil> GoGoGarrett:  var targetOffset = $target.offset().top - 70; i use this
[23:40:55] <GoGoGarrett> Ah, sorry I misunderstood your question.
[23:41:06] <GoGoGarrett> Do you have a jsfiddle of your code
[23:41:13] <daffodil> GoGoGarrett:  nope.
[23:41:26] <daffodil> GoGoGarrett:  i also use animate()
[23:42:39] <daffodil> GoGoGarrett:  see this link http://www.alfredapp.com/  they do the same thing
[23:45:17] <daffodil> GoGoGarrett:  any idea where i might being going wrong?
[23:48:24] <GoGoGarrett> well if you're trying to do what the guys using, you can just install the 2 plugins he's using.  Or you could post your code on a jsfiddle or pastebin or jsbin or something, so we can see your code
