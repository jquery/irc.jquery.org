[00:10:36] <maddle> hi. is there any chance to get an live event if an element has been added?
[00:13:23] <user_corrupt> m looking for a slider plugin that will allow me to put html as well as images into the slider
[00:14:05] <user_corrupt> preferably free
[00:33:04] <TheBrayn> how do I see if toggle() has hidden or shown an element?
[00:33:53] <TheBrayn> nvm
[00:49:22] <TheBrayn> http://jsfiddle.net/afUBC/ why doesn't this change the text of the button?
[00:53:42] <shoky> TheBrayn: .is('visible') checks if it's a <visible> element
[00:53:50] <shoky> you prolly want :visible
[00:54:11] <TheBrayn> thanks
[00:59:48] <TheBrayn> is(':visible')?
[01:00:51] <xec_> ?tias
[01:00:51] <b-ot> xec_, Try It And See
[01:00:54] <TheBrayn> ah yes
[01:01:09] <TheBrayn> it didn't work for a different reason which was why I asked
[01:29:02] <fulminator> can someone tell me please a php channel? #php seems to do not work
[01:30:05] <Cork> fulminator: ##php
[01:30:11] <Cork> (two #)
[01:30:17] <fulminator> lol why?
[01:30:24] <Cork> freenode works like that
[01:30:34] <Cork> # is for the product
[01:30:39] <Cork> ## is for community
[01:31:01] <fulminator> so jquery has only one # ?
[01:31:09] <fulminator> that means it's a product?
[01:31:10] <Cork> don't ask me :)
[01:31:21] <Cork> but ya, tecnically is should be
[01:31:51] <Cork> there's more channels that doesn't have that restriction either
[01:31:52] <fulminator> ty corky
[01:32:22] <Cork> suspect that someone with authority for the group/company that made the product opens the channel
[01:32:25] <Cork> and make it open
[01:32:37] <Cork> community can only start ## channels
[01:33:19] <fulminator> how can I list the channels with double # ?
[01:33:30] <fulminator> list command seems to show only the #
[01:33:39] <Cork> fulminator: well you could do a /list
[01:33:41] <Cork> list shows all
[01:33:53] <Cork> but the list is so damn long that you don't want to :)
[01:34:01] <Cork> and it prob list # first
[01:34:07] <Cork> not sure
[01:34:16] <fulminator> I did a list command but none of ## seems to appear
[01:34:26] <Cork> (cause i've never had the patient to wait for it to completely download
[01:35:36] <fulminator> i cant find the php channel anywhere... however, there are a lot of channels on php specific frameworks
[01:35:42] <fulminator> am I missing something?
[01:36:09] <Cork> you basically can't find channels through /list
[01:36:21] <Cork> google for freenode channel for the project you're interested in
[01:36:27] <Cork> but in this case its ##php
[01:36:32] <Cork> just join it
[01:36:41] <Cork> (you need a registered nick though)
[01:36:55] <Erika_Mustermann> Is there a plugin to give a site social bookmark functionality, ie. the ability to tag links and view links by tags?   I'd like the ability to tag links and then display links by their tags/catergories for a links page.
[01:37:53] <Cork> Erika_Mustermann: that can't really be a plugin
[01:38:00] <Cork> it needs to be a full service
[01:38:16] <Cork> so check for social bookmaring services
[01:38:20] <Erika_Mustermann> Just for a personal site?
[01:38:32] <Cork> you can't have socoial for it
[01:38:37] <Cork> it needs to be stored somewhere
[01:38:47] <Erika_Mustermann> Yes, I mean without the social aspect, sorry.
[01:38:51] <Cork> lol
[01:38:54] <Cork> ok
[01:39:16] <Cork> so you want to push the users options to a backend sever or something?
[01:39:29] <Cork> or where should they be stored?
[01:39:47] <Erika_Mustermann> Frontend :x
[01:39:59] <Cork> frontend?
[01:40:20] <Cork> so like in cookie or localStorage?
[01:40:28] <Erika_Mustermann> On the page itself.  I figured using a json for the list of links would do the trick?
[01:40:44] <Cork> ya, but where would you store the json?
[01:40:56] <Erika_Mustermann> Ah, yes on the server.
[01:41:00] <Erika_Mustermann> netsplit?
[01:41:00] <Cork> -_-'
[01:41:12] <Erika_Mustermann> Cork: Not much sleep sorry lol
[01:41:15] <Cork> net remerge
[01:41:20] <Cork> it split a bit back
[01:42:21] <Cork> Erika_Mustermann: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=jquery+site+bookmarks
[01:42:29] <Cork> have a go :)
[01:43:19] <mdedetrich> I have this weird issue where I cannot remove html after inserted into the DOM
[01:43:32] <mdedetrich> It can fadein fine, but it can't get removed (or faded out)
[01:43:45] <Cork> mdedetrich: link or testcase
[01:43:51] <Erika_Mustermann> Cork: Leads to lots of scripts to add your site to a user's bookmarks list lol
[01:44:08] <Cork> Erika_Mustermann: is a search engine
[01:44:12] <Cork> so ya :)
[01:44:13] <norbi> hi guys, i have a little problem, im appending a selectbox as an object into a form, im setting with attr(name,"selectname") its name and then im submiting the form, i get an empty variable of selectname even if an option value is selected
[01:44:18] <norbi> what can cause that?
[01:44:44] <norbi> err * attr("name","selectname");
[01:45:01] <mdedetrich> Cork: the code is incredibly complicated, its a library Im making
[01:45:16] <mdedetrich> Cork: is there a way to tell if references to 2 selectors are equal?
[01:45:32] <Cork> mdedetrich: not really
[01:45:38] <Cork> mdedetrich: you're selecting by id?
[01:46:01] <mdedetrich> Cork: no I am dynamically generating html through client side templating (jade)
[01:46:08] <mdedetrich> and then inserting into the DOM
[01:46:35] <Cork> you're sure you're not giveing fadeout the html from jade?
[01:46:46] <Erika_Mustermann> Yeah, none of these results are useful :[
[01:46:52] <Cork> you need to reference the dom that it creates
[01:46:56] <Cork> mdedetrich: ^
[01:47:04] <Cork> Erika_Mustermann: sorry no clue then
[01:47:11] <mdedetrich> Cork: yeah I know that
[01:47:23] <mdedetrich> I do this first to put it into the DOM
[01:47:24] <mdedetrich> html = $(error.html)
[01:47:33] <mdedetrich> then I do this
[01:47:34] <mdedetrich> $('body').after(html)
[01:47:55] <Cork> and then html.fadeout() ?
[01:47:57] <mdedetrich> Cork: after that point, everything is referenced through the html variable
[01:48:17] <mdedetrich> Cork: yes
[01:48:25] <mdedetrich> Cork: html.fadeIn works fine
[01:48:35] <norbi> guys, can u help me too pls? its probably something simple here what i miss
[01:48:37] <mdedetrich> html.fadeOut won't work
[01:48:39] <norbi> its annoying
[01:48:53] <mdedetrich> Cork: they happend at different times obviously
[01:48:53] <Cork> have you checked to that the variable is what you expect when you try to hide it?
[01:49:09] <Cork> this sounds like a race condition
[01:49:16] <Cork> or scope condition
[01:49:47] <Cork> norbi: link or testcase
[01:49:50] <Cork> ?p
[01:49:50] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:51:01] <mdedetrich> Cork: ok I assigned the html globally to window.somehtml
[01:51:14] <mdedetrich> and so now I am just doing window.somehtml.fadeIn()
[01:51:21] <mdedetrich> and window.somehtml.fadeOut()
[01:51:41] <Cork> add console.log(window.somehtml.length) just before fadeOut
[01:52:31] <mdedetrich> Cork: its 1 in length
[01:52:48] <Cork> and fadeOut fails?
[01:52:59] <mdedetrich> everything fails, I am trying to do remove now
[01:53:31] <mdedetrich> hmm wait
[01:53:35] <mdedetrich> I think I got it
[01:54:18] <duderion> I'm in trouble with json_encode
[01:55:14] <norbi> Cork: this is the abstract version of the whole, i take some json data with ajax then transmit it to variable, $.each them etc, but the main problem is arround this: http://jsfiddle.net/2fkNL/
[01:55:15] <mdedetrich> Cork: yeah I fixed it
[01:55:20] <mdedetrich> Cork: it was a logic error, my bad
[01:55:47] <Cork> mdedetrich: it usually is, the problem is finding it :)
[01:55:50] <norbi> when i submit the form that has the selectbox in with first option selected for example, i get an empty variable
[01:56:00] <duderion> i have to produce the following via json_encode http://pastebin.com/EjHDxhqS
[01:56:13] <duderion> and i dunno what the array should look like
[01:56:14] <Cork> norbi: "submitting"?
[01:56:25] <Cork> norbi: you don't have any ajax call or form tag
[01:56:33] <duderion> especially because of the square brackets in values
[01:57:11] <Cork> duderion: that's a question for ##php not jquery
[01:57:23] <duderion> oh shit ;]
[01:57:25] <Cork> but ya, its just an array
[01:57:37] <duderion> ya i know
[01:57:45] <norbi> Cork: i didn't wanted to paste the whole code, it contains php and lot more in there
[01:57:52] <duderion> yep
[01:57:52] <Cork> and objects, is arrays in php
[01:57:54] <duderion> no prob
[01:58:09] <norbi> Cork: i guess there is a dom problem with assigning the name to the selectbox or something like that
[01:58:17] <Cork> duderion: so just have a straight array and inside it have an array with keys
[01:58:28] <Cork> and you should get the structure
[01:58:46] <Cork> norbi: sure the code isn't needed
[01:59:16] <Cork> norbi: but a simple form tag with a bogus target and how you submit it is needed to understand the flow
[01:59:26] <norbi> ok
[01:59:29] <Erika_Mustermann> Cork: http://www.designchemical.com/blog/index.php/jquery/create-an-automatic-content-filter-using-jquery-css-classes/  This is more along the lines of what I'm looking for
[02:00:10] <duderion> cork: i tried this array, but it doesn't produce the square brackets for values http://pastebin.com/xauv1bJW
[02:00:29] <duderion> i know its php.. i'll ask there if it's nerving ;]
[02:00:38] <Cork> ya, i know
[02:00:57] <Cork> duderion: so just have a straight array and inside it have an array with keys <-- but this should get you going
[02:01:53] <norbi> Cork: i dont know if this changes something but : http://jsfiddle.net/2fkNL/1/
[02:02:11] <Cork> that's all i need
[02:03:35] <Cork> norbi: is the user meant to change the value before the submit?
[02:03:54] <Cork> cause that works for me on that test case post source: selectres=1&submit=Submit+Query
[02:04:04] <norbi> Cork: yea
[02:05:10] <Cork> so wfm; there's something else breaking it on your page
[02:05:12] <norbi> Cork: the value isnt changing, but the name of the selectbox, cause it gets an iteration, like <select name='cat[0]'></select><select name='cat[1]'></select><select name='cat[2]'></select>
[02:06:08] <Cork> then you're doing something differently then on that fiddle
[02:07:32] <norbi> Cork: here is the code: http://pastebin.com/1y6UH7jk
[02:07:51] <norbi> turn off pls text wraping from pastebin, cause it brakes the text with the wraping
[02:09:24] <norbi> Cork: i know its messy, but its a fast method to do it, cause im hurry to school and this needs to be done..
[02:10:59] <Cork> norbi: that code makes my head spin a bit
[02:11:12] <Cork> you never use the data you get from the ajax call
[02:11:21] <Cork> you create a string statically when the page loads
[02:11:38] <Cork> or am i missing where you're using msg?
[02:11:56] <norbi> im using msg in $.each
[02:12:09] <Cork> sure
[02:12:13] <Cork> but then you don't do anything with it
[02:12:19] <Cork> function() { <--
[02:12:26] <norbi> i use this.id, this.value
[02:12:38] <Cork> ah down there
[02:12:42] <Cork> so ya, i did miss it :)
[02:13:03] <norbi> :)
[02:13:35] <Cork> and whats $(".cautahotbtn") ?
[02:13:53] <Cork> na that doesn't matter
[02:14:00] <norbi> its an <a href='#'>search</a>
[02:14:30] <Cork> ok, i'm understanding the flow for how the select boxes are created
[02:14:31] <norbi> this thing wants to be a fast method to seach with ajax and display results in a table
[02:14:58] <Cork> norbi: check the generated dom structure
[02:15:09] <norbi> but the search result has some static searchboxes near by and they have some relevance to the results
[02:15:14] <Cork> and make sure that the names are what you expect
[02:15:22] <norbi> they are
[02:15:26] <Cork> norbi: ya, the ajax call looks fine
[02:15:34] <Cork> and after that the browser doesn't care
[02:15:47] <norbi> for example one inspected element has name <selectÂ name="exim[2][categorie]">
[02:15:47] <Cork> is it in the dom on the correct place (inside the form)
[02:15:52] <Cork> it works
[02:16:26] <Cork> and the form, select or option tags isn't closed before they should be?
[02:16:58] <Cork> (that is basically the only thing that cause it if it uses plain form submit)
[02:17:39] <ackpacket_> If I have a parent container, with a variety of child elements, and one of those elements is clicked, how can I select the first '.myClass' found AFTER the clicked element?
[02:17:40] <norbi> it is in the form, on the bottom is the hmtl part: http://pastebin.com/fQfQ7Mvv
[02:18:36] <norbi> Cork: i thought about invalid html, i checked for it, but no "" or /> or smth like this missed
[02:19:01] <Cork> ackpacket_: $(this).nextAll('.myClass').first()
[02:19:24] <ackpacket_> Cork: ty
[02:19:30] <Cork> norbi: save the generated html and run it through w3c
[02:19:45] <Cork> norbi: and if that doesn't give you anything go through it by hand
[02:21:58] <myselfhimself> Hi
[02:22:15] <myselfhimself> I'm using jquery tools' overlay library
[02:22:49] <myselfhimself> which allows embedding an URL within a lightbox with a syntax like $('selector').overlay({params})
[02:23:48] <myselfhimself> I would like to bind a 'click' event on buttons that have overlay() on them already, but those click event don't get triggered, why ?
[02:24:09] <norbi> Cork: it looks like it validates, only the result data has some encoding problems: http://validator.w3.org/check
[02:24:11] <norbi> ah
[02:24:36] <Cork> myselfhimself: you might try to bind the button before it exists
[02:25:11] <norbi> Cork: here is the generated html: http://pastebin.com/D86jkF4q
[02:25:23] <myselfhimself> Cork: that button is already on the page (i'm talking about the button that gets clicked before the overlay shows up) and is generated by PHP
[02:26:03] <Cork> norbi: again, theres no form there
[02:26:19] <Cork> norbi: ctrl + a the page
[02:26:36] <Cork> and then view source and save the generated html
[02:26:44] <Cork> then you should get what's really in the dom
[02:27:30] <Cork> myselfhimself: ya, but you said you tried to bind it but the event didn't fire
[02:28:13] <Narhir> hey Guys
[02:28:17] <Narhir> I have a question..
[02:28:28] <Narhir> I created webform with "Basic" view and "advanced" view
[02:28:39] <Narhir> advanced view shows up after clicking advanced search and it slideout from the top.
[02:28:45] <Narhir> but at the bottom it gets small "bump"
[02:28:53] <Narhir> and it doesnt move smoothly
[02:29:10] <Narhir> I found out that it is caused by floating <li> element that contains checkboxes
[02:29:25] <Narhir> do you know how cna I fix it whichout removing the floating from checkboxes?
[02:29:53] <norbi> Cork: only the selectbox wont submit, the other data appears fine in order, like data[0][id], data [0]['val'], data[0]['selectbox'] data[1][id], data [1]['val'], data[1]['selectbox']
[02:30:04] <norbi> only the data[][selectbox] is missing value
[02:30:39] <norbi> and they are in the same dom with data[0][id], data [0]['val']
[02:31:34] <Cork> norbi: ok, try if you can reproduce the problem in the jsfiddle (or with a live link)
[02:31:49] <Cork> i can't really help you without seeing the problem
[02:32:27] <Cork> Narhir: thats a css question, so => #css
[02:35:59] <norbi> Cork: i added this to the code: selectbox.change(function(){alert($("option:selected",this).val());});
[02:36:07] <norbi> then it gives me the selected value
[02:36:08] <Cork> :s
[02:36:12] <norbi> on change
[02:36:26] <Cork> that doesn't prove anything
[02:36:27] <norbi> but after submit it wont give me the value
[02:37:12] <Cork> console.log($.map($('form select'), function(elm) { return $(this).val(); }));
[02:37:36] <Cork> preferably replace "form select" with an id for the form
[02:37:53] <Cork> like $('#myformid select')
[02:38:06] <Cork> but do NOT base it on the selectbox variable
[02:45:16] <norbi> Cork solved
[02:45:20] <norbi> thank u for help!
[02:45:37] <norbi> the problem was that i had same kind of results in the same page below
[02:45:59] <norbi> and same variable name, and didnt observed, that overwrited the selectbox variable name
[02:46:14] <norbi> i knew its something "LOW"
[02:48:13] <Cork> :)

[02:57:02] <DerLola> Hi guys, is there a way to set the starting value for NON css values?
[02:57:18] <DerLola> I use animate() .step function with custom properties
[02:57:31] <DerLola> but since it's not a css value, I cannot set the starting value
[03:02:56] <Laurentvd> Mmm I dropped, I'm DerLola
[03:03:02] <Laurentvd> did I miss a response? :)
[03:17:06] <abletony84> Greetings :-)
[03:17:11] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/G3Ex5/ - how do I force all non-sponsored posts to show?
[03:19:25] <faraway> Laurentvd: do you mix custom and css ?
[03:20:50] <zest_> uy
[03:20:52] <zest_> yo
[03:37:04] <Laurentvd> faraway sorry for late response, no I dont
[03:37:18] <Laurentvd> I just animate my custom properties
[03:41:56] <Laurentvd> Just a quick fiddle of what I'm currently doing: http://jsfiddle.net/DerLola/yCnBJ/
[03:45:10] <NodeX> anyone know a cool trick to unwind nested elements into an array or somehting ... for example  <div id="one"><div id="two"><div id="three"></div></div></div> turn into 3 separate objects
[03:46:08] <howardgrigg> hi guys - I'm trying to apply a plugin to a formfield that I'm loading through ajax but I can't get it to work - this is what I've tried http://pastie.org/5387048
[03:46:41] <Cork> NodeX: just find all the element and you should get a flat array
[03:46:54] <Cork> ex $('div')
[03:48:22] <NodeX> then I can each them
[03:48:23] <NodeX> ?
[03:48:31] <NodeX> I didn't even think of that LOl
[03:48:49] <NodeX> is there a "reverse" in javascript to reverse the array in a simple manner
[03:50:04] <DerLola> I updated the fiddle, so you can run it
[03:50:05] <DerLola> http://jsfiddle.net/DerLola/yCnBJ/3/
[03:50:17] <DerLola> If anyone has the answer, I'd be grateful :)
[03:51:16] <Cork> NodeX: how many levels do you have?
[03:51:35] <NodeX> unknown - it's to un-nest replies
[03:51:35] <Cork> NodeX: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7875070/how-to-flatten-array-in-jquery
[03:51:42] <NodeX> could be hundreds in theory
[03:51:47] <Cork> ah
[03:52:02] <Cork> then you would have to have a recursive looping function to solve it
[03:52:09] <NodeX> I just want to unnest anything and put it in reverse order
[03:53:09] <Cork> well reverse exists
[03:53:15] <Cork> flatten is another matter
[03:53:32] <NodeX> thanks Cork
[03:53:49] <Cork> you might be able to build a loop that uses Array.contact
[03:53:52] <Cork> but... na :s
[03:54:12] <NodeX> infact it will only ever be one
[03:54:23] <NodeX> once submitted it's unwound anyway
[03:54:31] <Cork> then the link up there would work
[03:55:08] <Cork> $.map(arr, function(value) { return value; });
[03:55:24] <Cork> and $.map(arr, function(value) { return value; }).reverse();
[03:55:25] <Cork> :D
[03:55:34] <Cork> not too bad ^^'
[03:56:09] <Cork> or Array.prototype.concat.apply([], arr).reverse() if you prefer that
[04:00:49] <JaredE> whats the best way to update an ajax request url with a javascript variable within that gets set on an onchange?
[04:03:10] <NodeX> so how to pluck an object from an object - replace ?
[04:03:59] <NodeX> perhaps clone then remove?
[04:07:15] <Cork> NodeX: objects is harder
[04:07:26] <Cork> only way to modify them is through building a new one
[04:07:55] <milligan> Any obvious mistakes to this simple function, http://pastebin.com/y6Pit3Eq .. ? I have this check on the onKeyUp event of a <input type text...
[04:08:26] <Cork> milligan: don't use inline event listeners
[04:09:05] <milligan> Cork, what would be the correct approach ?
[04:09:43] <Cork> milligan: jquery .on/bind/delegate or pure addEventListener
[04:09:53] <Cork> and sorry i meant inline event attribute
[04:10:09] <Cork> milligan: on* in the html is from old dom1
[04:10:22] <Cork> and isn't compatible with modern event listeners
[04:10:32] <milligan> Got'cha. I'll give it a whack with jquerys .on() and see what I can do
[04:11:05] <Cork> milligan: additionally include the html in the next pb (the input tag) see ?p
[04:11:06] <bot-t> milligan, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:11:22] <faraway> DerLola: http://jsfiddle.net/yCnBJ/4/
[04:14:39] <DerLola> faraway that is awesome
[04:14:42] <DerLola> thanks a lot!
[04:15:10] <DerLola> I've never seen prop before
[04:17:48] <milligan> Cork, removed the on* from the html, added in a document ready function, $('#name').keyup(function(){ .. and now it's complaining about a "Unexpected identifier" ..
[04:18:15] <Cork> milligan: code please
[04:18:16] <milligan> oh, sec
[04:18:20] <milligan> might have found something here
[04:19:12] <milligan> Cork, http://fixee.org/paste/ld8kdlk/
[04:19:22] <milligan> argh
[04:19:22] <milligan> sec
[04:19:47] <Cork> and please not server code ;P
[04:19:53] <milligan> fixed it.. :)
[04:20:07] <milligan> Was my ' in the alert,hehe
[04:21:47] <seutje> milligan: and this is why ppl avoid squishing strings together to form inline JS
[04:22:14] <milligan> I'm a master of doing stuff the hard way, simply because I am too daft to learn the proper way :)
[04:22:18] <seutje> well, that, and it doesn't do any proper color-coding or w/e
[04:27:33] <Lee-Lee> I have this code: http://pastebin.com/yDmE86vY basically I want to show each page (an unordered list) separately. I've done var pages =  $('#pages ul'); pages.hide(); and thought I could display the second one by doing something like pages[2].show() .. wrong I know.. :P
[04:28:44] <DerLola> Lee-Lee if you want the second element
[04:28:57] <DerLola> you have to do $('#pages ul').index(1)
[04:30:17] <Lee-Lee> DerLola: Thanks, but I get: Uncaught TypeError: Object -1 has no method 'show'
[04:31:08] <Lee-Lee> DerLola: $('#pages ul').index(1) but itself just returns -1?
[04:31:41] <DerLola> I'll look into it
[04:32:10] <Cork> you're sure you're not looking for .eq ?
[04:32:13] <Cork> ?.eq
[04:32:13] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[04:33:47] <NielsWrk> Hello, is someone of the jquery-ui develop team onboard? I have a question about the selectable widget and his roadmap.
[04:33:55] <DerLola> Cork you're totally right
[04:34:03] <DerLola> I confused index with eq for a sec
[04:34:22] <Lee-Lee> Yup, that works :)
[04:35:39] <NielsWrk> There is an reported bug that you now have set to be fixed in 2.0 but we (our software) need to have that been fixed.
[04:36:00] <NielsWrk> ... asap ;0
[04:36:34] <NielsWrk> or to get a work around for it.
[04:38:28] <NielsWrk> i'm talking about this issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10060279/jquery-selectable-scrollable
[04:44:07] <milligan> Cork, I'm filling a jquery dialog with data that is searchable, using the fastLiveFilter plugin. Based on the search, I have several <tr>'s that contain different data that is meant to fill in a parent <form> upon click. How would I build that with jquery, when the values are dynamic loaded from database? Would I hadd a new jquery method pr generated <tr> ?
[04:45:03] <Cork> milligan: several ways
[04:45:31] <Cork> if the data comes as json, you could just map the table to the json structure and fill that
[04:45:53] <Cork> or if you get html have the data on the tags (data-field, data-value or something)
[04:46:28] <milligan> Option two sounds the most viable at the moment. Do you have an example I could take a look at ?
[04:46:47] <Cork> not really
[04:46:54] <milligan> Fair enough, haha :)
[04:47:24] <Cork> <tr><td data-field="type" data-value="15">big><td>...</td></tr>
[04:51:55] <milligan> Cork, would I fetch it using the .data() method ?=
[04:52:04] <Cork> yes
[05:07:20] <milligan> Cork, how do I get the actual data? $(this).data($(this),'data-field') returns an object ..
[05:07:31] <jamietech> hiya! how do i go about splitting by a newline character and then split each character in the resulting string?
[05:10:45] <NodeX> ?each
[05:10:45] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[05:10:59] <jamietech> i do that but it dupes strings

[05:16:12] <aqeel> hi room
[05:18:06] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/BH4Xg/
[05:18:19] <aqeel> am i doing it right the load function
[05:20:00] <aqeel> i would like to chek if the html have indeed fully loaded the external link and then if window has indeed loaded as well thus then the spinner is removed
[05:21:30] <rns> anyone know how I can unformat my inputs (with the autoNumericGet() function) in my params, rather than on the form itself?  http://jsfiddle.net/ZGmrX/
[05:34:07] <tintin> Can i ask question? Anybody there?
[05:34:14] <alcuadrado> what is executed before in an jqHXR: always or done?
[05:34:34] <tintin> It's a hard question, need jquery expert to get answered.
[05:34:43] <tintin> Any jquery expert here?
[05:36:38] <thinced> tintin: how about just asking your question?
[05:36:39] <Hooloovoo> anyone know if i can get a list of all console errors with JS?
[05:37:31] <thinced> Hooloovoo: there is something that might help you http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Console_API
[05:37:33] <tintin> When i click a tab from jquery ui tab, i need to remove/delete url parameters and reload that page contents
[05:37:35] <Hooloovoo> like 404 for resources, errors in JS exection etc.
[05:37:36] <tintin> How can i do it?
[05:37:49] <tintin> But i see the previous url parameter is still there
[05:39:33] <Hooloovoo> thinced: can't find any log of error messages that has occured in that documentation =/
[05:40:44] <thinced> tintin: You could use location.hash = 'new_hash'; and just change hash without reloading
[05:40:51] <aqeel> Hooloovoo: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/debug-jquery-events-with-listhandlers/
[05:40:52] <thinced> but you can reload after that too
[05:41:32] <FloLeBlanc> hi all
[05:42:06] <tintin> thinced: Is it location.hash or window.location.hash?
[05:42:17] <Hooloovoo> aqeel: not exactly what i'm looking for =/
[05:43:12] <FloLeBlanc> could someone help me out on this problem: http://pastebin.com/Zxyvuq0J => if I do not add a custom message the error message disappears as soon as the 2 fields are different again but show the title of the field - if I add the custom message the error does not go away after typing the next letter (making the 2 fields different again)
[05:43:37] <aqeel> console is independent....all have their own way of handling
[05:43:57] <thinced> tintin: both works
[05:44:04] <perty> hey, is there any way to do something like:  $(#foo).focus(function() { $(#foo).value = ""; $(#foo).focus(null); }); ??
[05:44:10] <perty> because that one doesnt seem to work
[05:44:36] <thinced> perty: $("#foo") ?
[05:44:43] <perty> well yeah im just paraphrasing
[05:44:53] <thinced> ok
[05:46:49] <tintin> thinced: I need to clearn parameters like, http://localhost/index.php?id=5#tabs-2 will become http://localhost/index.php
[05:46:52] <tintin> I need to clearn parameters like, http://localhost/index.php?id=5#tabs-2 will become http://localhost/index.php
[05:46:55] <tintin> How can i do it?^
[05:49:03] <rns> anyone know how I can unformat my inputs (with the autoNumericGet() function) in my params, rather than on the form itself?  http://jsfiddle.net/ZGmrX/
[05:50:22] <AxonetBE> How can I get to the selected radio button from this? https://gist.github.com/4087498
[05:51:03] <AxonetBE> I tried $(this).siblings("input[type='radio']:checked") but it is empty
[05:51:13] <tintin> How can i remove url parameters during tab click from jquery tabs?
[05:53:25] <jacobroufa> tintin - $('#tabs').tabs({beforeActivate: function(ui, event){ /* do stuff here */ }, });
[05:53:43] <aqeel> Hooloovoo: http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/apidocs/org/apache/commons/httpclient/HttpStatus.html
[05:53:45] <jacobroufa> tintin - http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/ <-- everything you can do with tabs stems from what you see here
[05:55:08] <aqeel> Hooloovoo: http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/api/org/springframework/http/HttpStatus.html
[05:55:37] <tintin> jacobroufa: What is ui here?
[05:55:46] <Hooloovoo> aqeel: not sure how to use that to accomplish what i want.
[05:56:24] <Hooloovoo> basically what i want is all the red lines in the console in a array
[05:56:33] <Hooloovoo> i can listen to the onload event on a resource
[05:56:41] <Hooloovoo> but that would mean i have to load all resources with js
[05:56:49] <Hooloovoo> i think...
[05:57:11] <jacobroufa> tintin - ui is object - the new or old tab or panel
[05:57:15] <tintin> How can i redirect to other page with jquery?
[05:57:47] <tintin> jacobroufa: So how can i remove url parameters beforeactivating a tab?
[05:57:55] <tintin> There will be no parameters
[05:57:59] <jacobroufa> tintin - im not gonna write your code for you. jquery has extensive api pages and google is your friend. :)
[05:58:00] <tintin> it will be clean
[06:00:52] <tintin> jacobroufa: Why does jquery ui tab stores the previous url parameters?
[06:00:56] <tintin>  Why does jquery ui tab stores the previous url parameters?
[06:02:39] <aqeel> maybe for history purposes
[06:03:02] <aqeel> if you off then on and thus maintain where one left off
[06:03:14] <tintin> When i click a tab, it is supposed to remove/delete the previous url parameters and reload new url
[06:03:33] <tintin> aqeel: How can i remove history with jquery?
[06:03:34] <aqeel> which browser are oyu using for tedting purposes
[06:03:51] <tintin> firefox
[06:05:07] <aqeel> can u tell me what exactly u want to do
[06:05:20] <aqeel> may be u can do it the easy eway
[06:06:40] <Nasrudin> Hi there, I have some issues with JScrollpane
[06:07:07] <Nasrudin> when I use the newest version of JQuery it won't work properly, but it does when I use jquery 1.4.2
[06:07:27] <aqeel> 1.7 else 1.8.2 is a huge change
[06:08:07] <aqeel> 1.4.2 can be latest upgraded to 1.7 else use 1.8.2 and recode
[06:08:39] <Nasrudin> Alright, I'll look into it
[06:08:43] <tintin> aqeel: http://localhost/index.php?id=5#tabs-2 , when you click the first tab link, the url should be http://localhost/index.php , how can i do it?
[06:08:52] <FloLeBlanc> nvm my question: only happens in IE9
[06:09:04] <tintin> aqeel: But it is still http://localhost/index.php?id=5#tabs-1
[06:09:19] <tintin> aqeel: ?id=5 should not be there as url
[06:09:36] <tintin> aqeel: It should be new url without any parameter
[06:09:51] <tintin> aqeel: But for first tab link, #tabs-1 can be allowed
[06:09:51] <aqeel> i am getting 404 page not ound error
[06:11:20] <aqeel> how am i to look nto your code if page is not loading
[06:12:26] <tintin> aqeel: page is loading the new contents but the previous url parameters is still there
[06:12:48] <justHannes> hey everbody  - i wanna do something for which i would have used `.live` in the past, now i read i should use `.on` is there anything in particula i have to do ? (i want to append an event handler to an element which does not exist as of now)

[06:19:09] <aqeel> are you sure for your link ands page contents
[06:19:22] <aqeel> http://localhost/index.php?id=5#tabs-2
[06:19:29] <tintin> aqeel: Yes
[06:19:38] <aqeel> clicking will give that page
[06:19:54] <aqeel> u click it and see for your self
[06:20:02] <tintin> aqeel: Yes, i get that page, but still the url has this parameter ?id=5
[06:20:30] <aqeel> how am i suppose to help you if i cannot see code or what is going on within the code
[06:21:47] <tintin> https://gist.github.com/4087695
[06:21:52] <tintin> aqeel: it's like this: ^
[06:23:16] <tintin> No, like this: https://gist.github.com/4087695
[06:23:18] <tintin> aqeel: ^
[06:23:55] <tintin> No, like this: https://gist.github.com/4087695
[06:23:57] <tintin> aqeel: ^
[06:24:07] <aqeel> ok
[06:24:49] <aqeel> tintin: http://jsfiddle.net/CyjuD/
[06:24:53] <aqeel> seems to be working
[06:25:30] <aqeel> click run and see in the body section and click all different tabs
[06:26:53] <aqeel> so what is your issue....this seems to be functional
[06:27:30] <tintin> aqeel: But when you do something on page2.php content the url parameter changes, now if you click the first tab, the url parameters are still there
[06:27:38] <tintin> Did you understand the problem?
[06:27:48] <aqeel> let me see again
[06:32:35] <zacktu> i have a webapp where page A has an href link that has been placed by ajax - the link is to an external page - the way back to page A is by the browser back button, but when I return to page A it is blank --  I've tried reading about this, but there is lots of conflicting information and I don't know whether any of it fits my circumstances -- what's  a good approach?
[06:33:43] <faraway> zacktu: do you use history.pushState ?
[06:34:27] <karolyi> when i specify more callbacks to an event, whick order do they get executed?
[06:34:36] <karolyi> when i specify more callbacks to an event, which order do they get executed?
[06:35:07] <tintin> beforeLoad( event, ui )
[06:35:08] <zacktu> faraway: no i don't -- i've read about it, but i don't know where i should use it
[06:35:08] <tintin> Triggered when a remote tab is about to be loaded
[06:35:12] <tintin> What is remote tab?
[06:35:13] <faraway> karolyi: in the order the are are applyed
[06:35:16] <sunbeam> Adding stylesheets for browsers conditionally
[06:35:19] <sunbeam> (responsive)
[06:35:21] <sunbeam> is this recommebdable?
[06:35:23] <sunbeam> I've got a site where the mobile version is 99% different from the desktop version
[06:35:39] <karolyi> faraway: thanks
[06:35:40] <faraway> zacktu: so you don't us ;) this could have been a problem
[06:36:41] <aqeel> tintin i can't seem to get what you are facing as i cannot see your live demo and i have no way to see what is going on as clear as if you can unless put up a working problem...
[06:37:00] <zacktu> faraway: i've googled for "html5 history" but not "jquery history" -- is that where i should start looking for an example?
[06:37:28] <faraway> karolyi: one exception is when you use .live or .on with a selector
[06:38:30] <faraway> zacktu: that will not solve you problem, if you use this could be a reason for the problem
[06:38:47] <faraway> zacktu: but without knowing the page it is not really possible to help you
[06:40:31] <aqeel> sunbeam: http://www.jquery4u.com/mobile/detect-mobile-devices-jquery/
[06:40:57] <zacktu> faraway: you need the href of the page that i'm linking to?
[06:41:46] <faraway> zacktu: no .. the page form which you link and when going back is blank
[06:43:11] <sunbeam> aqeel: no i mean, i need to do it based on screen res
[06:43:38] <zacktu> faraway: i can put the code into pastebin (or whichever one you suggest)
[06:43:42] <sunbeam> aqeel: do you consider this method safe?
[06:44:01] <aqeel> yes
[06:44:30] <justHannes> aqeel: thanks, got it to work - was confused becaused (as it turned out) the jquery plugin i used always replaced the pre existing #container on my page so the bind was of course also gone ^^
[06:44:55] <aqeel> glad to have helped
[06:47:01] <faraway> zacktu: my guess is that this won't help to find the problem, but you can past on pastebin
[06:51:26] <zacktu> faraway: pastebin has ruined the formatting -- i don't see how you could read it anyway -- it seems to me that if I could just know that the back button was pressed i could rebuild the previous page

[07:43:18] <haggisking> @aniasis I had the same problem!  Have a look at the deferred and promise documentation.  I makes your code MUCH simpler. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.promise/
[07:43:22] <webguynow> I was actually trying to capture a click event from an Iframe
[07:43:49] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/BH4Xg/
[07:44:01] <aqeel> how reliable is my load() function
[07:44:07] <webguynow> by putting an invisible div over it, and capturing the click from that div.  I'm close, but might need z-index tweak - Not sure
[07:45:59] <webguynow> anyone have a thought ?  my z-index idea didn't work

[07:46:21] <hlve> jsfiddle.net sir
[07:46:41] <Pitel_IPEX> ok...
[07:47:13] <hlve> we can't troubleshoot dead code. jsfiddle.net allows us to debug in real time
[07:49:15] <aniasis> haggisking, yes I attempted to use deferred/promise but don't know

[07:58:55] <JonahSchulte> Has anyone encountered an issue with jQuery UI 1.8.x sliders where you drag the slider, but if you move the mouse off the slider itself and then mouseup, the slider changes but the items are not actually filtered?
[07:58:59] <JonahSchulte> Example: http://ddcdemovolvo.cms.dealer.com/showroom/index.htm
[07:59:15] <JonahSchulte> so, while you're dragging the slider handle, move the mouse off the slider and then 'drop'
[07:59:41] <JonahSchulte> the slider moves but the vehicles on that page are not filtered. If you mouseup directly on the slider handle it works fine
[08:00:04] <JonahSchulte> I'm working on upgrading to jQuery UI 1.9.1 which does solve the issue, but am hoping to find a quicker solution (upgrading to 1.9.1 is quite a process for us)
[08:00:44] <JonahSchulte>  I also notice that that slider handle disappears when you move the mouse off the slider while dragging
[08:01:48] <flat_eric> hey guys, have problems with "$(document).ready(function(){". my browser isn't run the function... i can't execute a simple alert e.g. maybe somebody of you have an idea what happens?
[08:02:45] <rns> anyone know how I can unformat my inputs (with the autoNumericGet() function) in my params, rather than on the form itself?  http://jsfiddle.net/ZGmrX/
[08:04:48] <flat_eric> somebody please? :)
[08:05:08] <JonahSchulte> perhaps a link flat_eric?
[08:05:09] <hlve> flat_eric, can you mock up your code on http://jsfiddle.net ?
[08:05:38] <flat_eric> yes, i'll load up
[08:05:41] <flat_eric> wait a min. pls
[08:05:49] <hlve> ^^ thx
[08:06:11] <JonahSchulte> Do you have javascript disabled in your browser?
[08:06:19] <JonahSchulte> You mentioned "my browser isn't run the function"
[08:06:24] <JonahSchulte> Does it work in another browser?
[08:07:11] <flat_eric> nope js is on, and it doesn't work in another browser
[08:07:38] <hlve> just mock up the code so we can see what you're doing
[08:08:37] <mib_mib> hi guys, if i use: my_jquery = jQuery.noConflict(true);    (function(jQuery) {   //...some jquery code...  })(my_jquery);   then inside this block, my_jquery is aliased as 'jQuery' - however, i am using libs in here that also use the $ sign to alias jQuery - how can i create two aliases that are scoped to inside this block? does the first line inside need to be $ = jQuery ?
[08:09:13] <mib_mib> the problem is that i want the scope of the $ to just be inside this, and outside of this block it should be released

[08:10:43] <JonahSchulte> script type="text/x-js"  ?
[08:11:15] <flat_eric> text/javascript isn't working as well
[08:11:17] <systemfault> I prefer type="zomgwhyitdoesntwork/shit"
[08:11:27] <flat_eric> thats a good idea ^^
[08:11:38] <systemfault> flat_eric: It's really text/javascript
[08:12:00] <systemfault> Else.. the browser will skip the code
[08:13:14] <flat_eric> Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined fullcalendar.min.js:114

[08:13:18] <flat_eric> thats what my browser returns
[08:14:46] <hlve> lol
[08:14:52] <hlve> what?
[08:15:05] <hlve> that doesn't help us
[08:15:10] <hlve> with what you're doing
[08:15:46] <flat_eric> to point is, that when i use text/x-js then my browser isn't returning errormessages
[08:16:24] <flat_eric> now i changed back to text/javascript and get that messages :/ :P
[08:16:35] <systemfault> Good
[08:16:40] <systemfault> Now.. fix those issues
[08:17:25] <JonahSchulte> it doesn't return errors because it doesn't process the code :)
[08:17:45] <JonahSchulte> change text/x-js to text/javascript and make sure the files you're referencing exist

[08:34:23] <Changa> anyone?
[08:37:13] <tff> Hello, how might I go about dumping all the values in a multiple select, including those that are not selected?
[08:37:30] <Cork> Changa: thats... kinda nasty code...
[08:37:35] <kborchers> Changa: you have an error in your JS. you are trying to get the offset of the href attr on line 18 of anchor.js
[08:37:53] <Changa> whats wrong with it?
[08:37:59] <firstclassfunc> is there a good message passing library plugin?
[08:38:14] <Cork> you're looping the elements when all you really want is a delegated event listener
[08:38:26] <Cork> return this.each(function(){ <-- theres no point in that each
[08:38:38] <Cork> just move the click up to that row
[08:38:48] <Cork> or even better delegate the click events
[08:39:18] <aqeel> please direct me if i am wrong or right
[08:39:31] <kborchers> Changa: i told you. you are trying to get the offset of the href which is not an element. you need to get the offset of the anchor
[08:39:36] <Nasrudin> Hmm, the jspContainer's height is way too low when I implement the jScrollPane in JQuery
[08:39:46] <Nasrudin> anyone an idea what could cause this?
[08:39:58] <Cork> kborchers: no the selector is actually quite ok
[08:39:58] <Changa> hmm
[08:39:59] <Nasrudin> height and minheight are both 100%
[08:40:22] <rns> anyone know how I can unformat my inputs (with the autoNumericGet() function) in my params, rather than on the form itself?  http://jsfiddle.net/ZGmrX/
[08:40:45] <Cork> Changa: the #top element isn't on the page though
[08:40:54] <Cork> you need an id="top" at the top of the page
[08:41:27] <Cork> and thats why the normal anchor doesn't work either :)
[08:42:13] <Changa> ok Cork, I did what you told me both of them :) and it works
[08:42:26] <Changa> anything else nasty about the code?
[08:42:44] <Cork> Changa: lol no no
[08:42:47] <Nasrudin> and it's really the style width that's wrong
[08:42:55] <Nasrudin> height*
[08:42:57] <Cork> Changa: remove caller
[08:43:10] <Cork> Changa: and use this.click()
[08:43:15] <Cork> not $(caller)
[08:43:52] <Changa> done too :)
[08:43:53] <Cork> Changa: except for that it looks ok now
[08:44:03] <Changa> haha thank you
[08:44:04] <Cork> drop the $
[08:44:10] <Cork> its this in plugins
[08:44:27] <Changa> also done
[08:44:28] <Changa> thank you
[08:44:49] <Cork> var elementClick = $(caller).attr("href") => var elementClick = $(this).attr("href")
[08:45:08] <Changa> another thing, do you also get [jquery.form] terminating; zero elements found by selector :Cork
[08:45:25] <Cork> lets get the plugin working first :)
[08:45:31] <Changa> yep
[08:45:33] <Changa> done :)
[08:45:36] <Cork> much better
[08:46:05] <Cork> Changa: yes
[08:46:13] <Cork> its a log output for the jqeury.form plugin
[08:47:00] <Changa> Cork: is it normal to get these?
[08:47:08] <Cork> Changa: no
[08:47:34] <Cork> Changa: other note <A class="anchorLink" id="top" NAME="top"> <-- this isn't valid
[08:47:34] <Changa> is it because I'm trying to apply ajaxForm to nonexisting elements onthe page?
[08:47:50] <Cork> just add <span id="top"></span>
[08:48:31] <Changa> my habit of copy paste kills me sometimes...done
[08:48:31] <Cork> (and while you're add it you could prob update the doctype to <!doctype html>)
[08:49:19] <Cork> Changa: yo prob want to run a w3c validator over the page too
[08:49:19] <Changa> done and done
[08:49:28] <Cork> i see some stray tags here and there
[08:49:34] <Cork> ex. <li class="downwardsone"  >TOPLANTI TUTANAKLARI</a></li>
[08:49:39] <Changa> yeah I got 73 warnings
[08:50:24] <Cork> Changa: except for that and the log output it looks fine
[08:50:36] <Changa> why is the log output happening?
[08:50:50] <Cork> something is triggering the form validator
[08:50:52] <Cork> not sure what
[08:51:31] <Changa> hmm
[08:52:38] <Changa> maybe having these in my script when the elements are not on the page? $('#editform').ajaxForm(editoptions);
[08:53:02] <Cork> prob
[08:53:59] <Changa> can I use .load with this so it uses the .ajaxForm when those elements are actually loaded?
[08:54:48] <Changa> no
[08:54:52] <Changa> hmm
[08:55:08] <Cork> if($('#editform').length > 0) { $('#editform').ajaxForm(editoptions) }
[08:55:11] <Cork> might work
[08:55:45] <Changa> oh yeah
[08:57:32] <Changa> Cork: That fixed it. Thank you very much.

[09:26:17] <Changa> royalty I don't get what you are trying to do here
[09:28:52] <aqeel> y u want to find element and move it behind with javascript ...simply appendTo will be sffix
[09:28:53] <b-ot> (å±®'Ð”')å±®

[09:33:17] <Caelum> I am reprocessing some fields in a form before submitting it with ajaxSubmit, but it when I use .val() to update it it of course shows up on the form, so the user sees the re-processed values for a couple seconds until the form submits, is there a nice way to avoid that?
[09:33:21] <aqeel> sukima ...use on() and live() is  subjected to refrain as much as possible
[09:35:07] <Changa> Caelum can you put the code in jsfiddle?
[09:35:33] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/BH4Xg/
[09:35:43] <aqeel> how reliable is my load() function
[09:36:53] <royalty> Changa: I am trying to get the item behind every element where the class is description (in this case divs only) and throw the description behind it
[09:37:18] <royalty> but it either throws all the div elements behind an element that isn't a description
[09:37:22] <royalty> or doesn't do anything
[09:38:44] <Changa> royalty: what item?
[09:39:18] <royalty> Changa: I mean i just want every description behind its previous element
[09:39:53] <Changa> by behind you mean after? or before?
[09:40:06] <royalty> so say we have <a> foo </a> and <div class="description"> tralala </div> I want it behind
[09:40:12] <royalty> ohhhhh
[09:40:34] <royalty> but yeah
[09:40:43] <royalty> so i want the result of that thing being like
[09:40:53] <royalty> only one description div behind world

[09:49:47] <madsara> I'm having a bit of trouble figuring it out.
[09:50:06] <Changa> MrS1ck have you tried position: fixed? I don't know why you need any jQuery there
[09:50:13] <eph3meral> madsara: same way as you'd do anything based on an event
[09:50:24] <eph3meral> madsara: try using datepicker first, timepicker is 99% the same
[09:50:39] <madsara> eph3meral: Well, my question is what's the function that brings it up. "show" doesn't seem to have the intended effect.
[09:50:48] <MrS1ck> Well I'm unsure of how jQuery/mobile handles lists. I assume it could all be done in CSS.
[09:50:50] <madsara> And yeah, I'm digging into datepicker now.
[09:50:53] <eph3meral> madsara: what's the function that brings up the datepicker?
[09:50:58] <MrS1ck> I'm making a post to Stack Overflow as suggested.

[09:53:16] <MrS1ck> I now remember why I hate stack overflow.
[09:53:44] <MrS1ck> Apparently 'I require some advice in regards to making my list view scroll. Details and pictures inside!' isn't a good title because it has keywords pertaining to my issue in it.

[09:57:55] <Changa> Caelum: why don't you add the BID's after submitting the form - only way I can do without user noticing the val change is as if you add some hidden input with your values and pass them with the form
[09:58:38] <Caelum> Changa: oh of course, I call the visible fields something else and put the actual values in hidden fields

[10:24:33] <coder7of9> i would like to constrain the value entered into an input to be below 10 (for example) but would like to accomplish this onkeydown before the char is entered. however onkeydown i can get the value before the char is entered and the char entered but i do not know the position of the cursor so cannot determine the value in the input 12 vs 21 for example. is it hopeless?
[10:24:57] <NoiseEee> coder7of9: yes, and rude.
[10:25:02] <NoiseEee> coder7of9: check on keyup if you must,
[10:25:38] <coder7of9> onkeyup is ruder. then the user sees the car just type disappear. but if it is hopeless i will allow all and validate on change
[10:25:47] <royalty> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/r5gJx/24/ why can i not add the class?
[10:25:51] <coder7of9> thanks!
[10:26:16] <coder7of9> do you think the plugin numeric is rude?
[10:26:41] <NoiseEee> coder7of9: i think its rude when a site/app tries to control the behaviour of an <input> as I'm in it
[10:27:14] <coder7of9> an input which expects only numeric requires no constants
[10:27:20] <coder7of9> constanants
[10:27:34] <NoiseEee> royalty: what is inner() ?
[10:28:01] <NoiseEee> coder7of9: fair, but tell me after i've left the field, or preferably, when i'm trying to submit the form
[10:28:01] <coder7of9> enter date of birth: for example. you would believe it is better to allow constanants?
[10:28:23] <NoiseEee> coder7of9: no, i just find it rude and unexpected behaviour to constrain an <input> i'm in
[10:28:25] <coder7of9> yes i like onchange myself.
[10:28:30] <NoiseEee> coder7of9: its opinion of course
[10:28:52] <coder7of9> i like how google does it. onchange show a message for that field
[10:28:54] <royalty> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/r5gJx/25/
[10:28:59] <coder7of9> thanks
[10:29:04] <royalty> NoiseEee: should be better
[10:30:23] <NoiseEee> royalty: so, vocabularies is actually the first thing you iterate through, and then you want to add the class "vocab" to the (non-existing) element previous to it
[10:30:32] <NoiseEee> royalty: sounds like a problem
[10:31:17] <royalty> NoiseEee: i want to add it to fieldset
[10:31:35] <NoiseEee> fieldset isn't the element previous
[10:31:42] <NoiseEee> its the parent though
[10:32:01] <royalty> NoiseEee: oh wow thanks for that distinction I wouldn't have known!
[10:32:03] <NoiseEee> and uh, its the parent of EVERYTHING
[10:33:11] <royalty> NoiseEee: I know I want to add a class to it!
[10:33:44] <royalty> NoiseEee: but this is just an example on the html of the real site there are more fieldsets!
[10:34:23] <royalty> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/r5gJx/27/ still not working :(
[10:35:11] <rns> anyone know how I can unformat my inputs (with the autoNumericGet() function) in my params, rather than on the form itself?  http://jsfiddle.net/ZGmrX/
[10:36:38] <royalty> NoiseEee: just kidding it is working!

[10:46:11] <ogk1000> I have about 20 DL's on a page... I want it to reset for each DL list... but when I use
[10:46:11] <ogk1000> 		$('.cschedule dl>dd:odd').addClass('even'); it is counting every one on the page as one list, vs each list unique... any ideas?
[10:49:22] <warrenparsons> ogk1000: Use .each() on $('.cschedule dl')
[10:50:11] <ogk1000> 		$('.cschedule').each('dl dd:odd').addClass('even'); ?
[10:50:57] <warrenparsons> ogk1000: No, $('.cschedule dl').each('dd:odd').addClass('even');
[10:51:31] <ogk1000> weird its not working
[10:51:33] <maddle> bazzi: statt den status alle 3s auf dem server abzufragen wÃ¼rde ich stattdessen longpolling verwenden, damit ist der response bei einer Ã„nderung sofort da.
[10:51:36] <warrenparsons> ogk1000: Though I'm not quite sure why you'd want to add a class of "even" to odd elements.

[10:55:02] <ogk1000> please warrenparsons ?
[10:55:44] <warrenparsons> ogk1000: I'm busy with other things, sending me a PM won't facilitate anyone else helping you, and asking me to dig through all of the surrounding irrelevant code on your site is wasting my time.
[10:56:02] <ogk1000> all good then np thx
[10:56:13] <ogk1000> will try to setup a fiddle shortly then
[10:56:25] <warrenparsons> ogk1000: Great. I'll be happy to help you if I can.
[11:01:05] <minijupe> when I use the ui dialog, and the content is large enough to require a scroll box, the dialog always appears completely scrolled down to the bottom. Is this a feature or a bug?
[11:06:13] <rns> anyone know how I can unformat my inputs (with the autoNumericGet() function) in my params, rather than on the form itself?  http://jsfiddle.net/ZGmrX/
[11:15:49] <adavia> one question.. i have a table that generates rows automatically.. on each row i have autocomplete input fields.. im wondering why i loose the autocomplete function when i clone a row.. it only works with the first one
[11:17:41] <NoiseEee> adavia: you should be using event delegation on the table, not on the <input>s you have at load time
[11:18:48] <adavia> NoiseEee:  what i should change here http://jsfiddle.net/4XZMb/950/
[11:20:28] <NoiseEee> where do you initialize the autocompelte?
[11:20:28] <jrdn> is there a standard in updating / creating a resource? â€¦ i.e., `curl -d {'user' => {'name': 'John Doe'}} http://example.com/users` or `curl -d {'name': 'John Doe'} http://example.com/users`
[11:21:05] <NoiseEee> jrdn: you in the correct channel there?
[11:21:27] <adavia> NoiseEee:  i have another function that initialize the autocomplete
[11:22:00] <jrdn> NoiseEee, haha figure jquery peeps enjoy a proper api
[11:22:20] <NoiseEee> adavia: yeah well its only initializing it when your page loads i guess, and the fields aren't there yet. so either init each field as you add it, or see if you can use event delegation. good luck.
[11:22:35] <EnginA> was there an equivalent of classical JS snippet bind() in jQ ?
[11:22:45] <NoiseEee> EnginA: $.proxy
[11:22:51] <EnginA> ok
[11:25:04] <EnginA> it fixes the problem though I don't get why it happens
[11:25:27] <NoiseEee> i guess reading the API/manual page on $.proxy is a good place to get started EnginA
[11:25:27] <EnginA> event_handler(e){ foo(); }
[11:25:34] <rbennacer> hello
[11:25:39] <EnginA> context is correct in the event_handler but not in the foo when called from there, is taht normal ?
[11:25:59] <EnginA> the context switches to window
[11:26:09] <rbennacer> anybody know it it is possible to write text into the Jquery UI progress  bar?
[11:26:21] <NoiseEee> EnginA: because it hasn't been bound/proxy'd properly
[11:26:36] <EnginA> NoiseEee: so, you say that's the expected behaviour ?
[11:26:47] <EnginA> how does context change when another function is called
[11:27:04] <NoiseEee> EnginA: proxy the function call
[11:27:23] <EnginA> i get that...
[11:27:25] <NoiseEee> $.proxy(function(){ },this);
[11:27:30] <EnginA> but it doesn't make sense for me
[11:27:33] <EnginA> it works
[11:27:45] <EnginA> but I don't see why JS changes the context there
[11:27:50] <NoiseEee> this = window
[11:28:05] <EnginA> dear lord
[11:28:07] <NoiseEee> when not in a function / bound to something else
[11:28:09] <NoiseEee> thats JS
[11:28:35] <EnginA> ok, so if even if a bound function is calling an unbound function... the context changes to window ?
[11:28:59] <NoiseEee> afaik yep
[11:29:37] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this
[11:34:39] <EnginA> ok, now it's coming back to me.
[11:34:46] <EnginA> but still, this particular case does not make sense
[11:34:54] <EnginA> well, actually, it does.
[11:38:26] <gx_> can anyone help deduce why this jplayer instance is working in chrome/ie but not firefox? http://www.voicemailsforever.com/share/ggzfO5P0ub
[11:38:38] <gx_> pulling my hair out
[11:39:03] <hlve> gx_, link sfw?
[11:39:08] <gx_> yes
[11:39:31] <hlve> Error: TypeError: $(...).popover is not a function
[11:39:41] <gx_> yeah, let me take that out. maybe thats erroring it
[11:40:00] <hlve> if firefox hits a breaking point, typically it can screw up the rest of the functions
[11:40:20] <nightfly_> So, it seems that jquery removes handler from an element if you remove it from the DOM tree.
[11:40:29] <nightfly_> s/handler/handlers
[11:40:37] <hlve> gx_, another breaking point.... Error: ReferenceError: data is not defined - Source File: http://www.voicemailsforever.com/account/js/dashboard.js
[11:40:44] <BinaryKitten> gx_ also ... http://www.voicemailsforever.com/share/php/voicemailTable.php is 404ing
[11:40:49] <gx_> ahh. you know what
[11:40:57] <gx_> i forgot where i left off on this page
[11:40:57] <gx_> lol
[11:41:00] <BinaryKitten> which is probably whgere the dashboard.js error is being triggered
[11:41:19] <gx_> i had just pasted a lot of other js includes from the dashboard itself and didnt pay attention to what's actually being called
[11:41:24] <gx_> ok, i think i can take it from here
[11:41:30] <gx_> thx guys
[11:41:33] <gx_> and gals
[11:42:03] <BinaryKitten> gx_ Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'grab'    circle.player.js:160
[11:42:24] <gx_> yeah, i noticed that alert in IE. seems like thats something within circleplayer
[11:47:11] <gx_> the odd thing is that i have this exact same player instantiated on the actual dashboard itself, and it plays fine in ff on the dashboard
[11:47:46] <gx_> i've removed the voicemailTable ajax request (which im not using anymore anyway) and got rid of the popover call, still same thing
[11:50:40] <royalty> how would you add a class to a dynamically added element which is dynamically added via another script?
[11:50:54] <royalty> a script i don't have access to?
[11:51:26] <NoiseEee> you can still access the element royalty, and just add your class to it
[11:51:50] <royalty> NoiseEee: it isn't working though :(
[11:52:18] <gx_> royalty: you want to try using the .on selector
[11:52:19] <royalty> NoiseEee: what if it doesn't exist at the time the script is called?
[11:52:21] <gx_> sometimes fixes that
[11:52:24] <gx_> previously known as .live
[11:52:46] <royalty> gx_: i was looking at that but i just want to add a class after the element exists
[11:52:47] <gx_> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:52:50] <NoiseEee> royalty: indeed you can't do anything about that, you can only get to it after its in the DOM
[11:53:24] <gx_> his issue is sometimes dynamically created elements arent really registered in the DOM
[11:53:25] <royalty> gx_: is there an event that is something like when the element exists?
[11:53:43] <royalty> for use in .on?
[11:53:45] <gx_> royalty: what the .on() does is basically set up a "listener" for if that element is ever created in the future
[11:53:54] <gx_> from my understanding
[11:53:54] <NoiseEee> gx_: nope
[11:54:20] <NoiseEee> gx_: i mean, sure if the element fires an event... but not when the element suddenly appears
[11:54:21] <royalty> that would be great if it did that but the parameters it takes don't show that it does that
[11:54:48] <NoiseEee> royalty: you'll have to poll for it or use something like http://davidwalsh.name/detect-node-insertion
[11:55:42] <royalty> NoiseEee: poll for it?
[11:56:35] <NoiseEee> well, a setInterval that checks to see if the element exists
[11:58:17] <royalty> NoiseEee: I see
[11:58:28] <royalty> NoiseEee: thank you!
[11:59:00] <halcyon1234> Are jQuery Mobile and jQuery UI compatible? IE: Can I use a theme from UI to theme Mobile, can I use controls from UI on Mobile, etc?
[11:59:01] <NoiseEee> np good luck
[12:10:46] <Kn|t3> Hi people
[12:11:00] <Kn|t3> I have not used jquery before, but I have used Google Closure.
[12:11:21] <Kn|t3> Can you guys think of any scenario where Google Closure fits better than jquery?
[12:11:45] <Kn|t3> I know jquery is really fast to develop and very succinct to write
[12:11:59] <NoiseEee> Kn|t3: all the libs essentially do the same thing.  choose the one you're comfortable with, genereally, unless you're really into plugins
[12:12:31] <Kn|t3> NoiseEee: Plugins do play an important part, I don't want to write the whole code for showing an accordion
[12:12:46] <NoiseEee> im sure Closure has some, so check them out first I guess
[12:12:48] <MistuhKurtz> curious if anybody knows of some other cool 'presentation' or more advanced slideshow type plugins, for example http://sequencejs.com/
[12:13:15] <Kn|t3> NoiseEee: Oh well I am not sure if they have an accordion, but by far I think jquery has more plugins that Closure.
[12:14:05] <Kn|t3> NoiseEee: So my point is, considering I would get lot of reusable components in jquery. but would lose the advantages of Google Closure (like type checking, compiling ,etc), would it make sense to move to jquery?
[12:14:09] <NoiseEee> Kn|t3: and also way more poorly written ones
[12:14:40] <NoiseEee> Kn|t3: it would be a good choice for a quick new app i suppose, but certainly not worth rewriting past code imo
[12:15:18] <Kn|t3> NoiseEee: Hmm, I am talking about a new app. Its just the fear about the learning curve of jquery which made me ask this question.
[12:15:49] <NoiseEee> Kn|t3: well its still just JS; all you'd be doing is using a different API etc
[12:15:58] <NoiseEee> Kn|t3: i'm sure you'd be up to speed rather quickly if you're familiar with JS
[12:16:13] <MistuhKurtz> >the learning curve of jquery
[12:16:28] <MistuhKurtz> I'm pretty sure it's the easiest learning curve of anything programming-related that i've ever learned
[12:17:04] <MistuhKurtz> easier than learning to deal with IE6/7 CSS bugs back in the day
[12:17:20] <Kn|t3> NoiseEee, MistuhKurtz Rite. I think I will go with learning jquery :)
[12:17:30] <Kn|t3> IE6, people still use that?
[12:17:49] <NoiseEee> Kn|t3: people still use it, whether or not they're the people you're targetting is up to you :)
[12:18:50] <Kn|t3> Woah! I am surely not targetting those. I thought ie6countdown.com officially said we should stop using ie6
[12:19:01] <Kn|t3> http://ie6countdown.com/
[12:20:00] <Kn|t3> But, cool. I think I will go with learning jquery and will come back with (lot of? :) questions
[12:20:20] <tw2113> it's insignificant enough for me to not care at all
[12:20:22] <Kn|t3> Thanks for the help.
[12:21:29] <Kn|t3> Within a year I would expect that to go down ~1%
[12:22:28] <MistuhKurtz> Kn|t3, do realize that Closure and jQuery kind of serve different purposes
[12:22:45] <Kn|t3> Umm, I was talking about the library.
[12:23:01] <MistuhKurtz> right
[12:23:14] <Kn|t3> Aren't both of them supposed to be doing the same thing?
[12:23:17] <andrew9184> say I have foo = $('foobar'); how do I make a function inside foo so I can do something like foo.play() ?
[12:23:43] <MistuhKurtz> well tbh I don't know much about the lib but since it powers google's own apps I would think it would handle a lot more of the architecture of a web app
[12:24:07] <pags> kn|t3: jquery will likely be a foundational but small piece of your puzzle
[12:24:12] <MistuhKurtz> ^^
[12:24:49] <Kn|t3> pags: sure. I am just expecting it to help me write succinct javascript without caring about most of cross browser problems.
[12:24:55] <MistuhKurtz> a combination like jQuery + Backbone.js + underscore.js might suit your purposes well (there are lots of different options)
[12:25:24] <MistuhKurtz> jQuery will definitely serve that purpose Kn|t3
[12:25:59] <Kn|t3> Oh wait, I was reading about backbone.js, can I expect more from Jquery :) (greedy)
[12:26:51] <MistuhKurtz> like I said, they serve different purposes, you can use them together
[12:27:15] <pags> kn|t3: i'd recommend looking into just what exactly jquery provides. a lot of people miss this step. backbone.js\jquery aren't comparable.
[12:27:24] <pags> it'd be like comparing windows to java
[12:27:27] <pags> doesn't make sense
[12:28:11] <MistuhKurtz> read the intro on backbone.js, it explains the purpose it can serve alongside jquery
[12:28:28] <CodesStuff> I think I just lost braincells.
[12:28:42] * CodesStuff switches the tab
[12:30:09] <Kn|t3> Hmm, a lot to catch up :) I should be here regularly now.
[12:43:56] <scar> i have a dialog that opens up when a link is clicked in a table to "view" the data in that row. i then use ajax to pull the data. however, when i close the dialog window and click "view" again, the dialog opens up with the data in it... but i want it to continue laoding ajax how i tell it to

[12:57:34] <BillCriswell> hexblaze: Uh oh.
[12:57:44] <hexblaze> haha i know
[12:57:49] <BLeg> Has anyone ever had the problem where the callback in .animate is called before the animation is complete?
[12:58:11] <BillCriswell> BLeg: I have not.
[12:58:25] <BLeg> damn.
[12:58:46] <BillCriswell> Have an example of it happening BLeg?
[12:59:42] <hexblaze> BillCriswell , anyone : any experience with jquery-ui?
[12:59:47] <hexblaze> in particular autocomplete
[13:00:03] <BillCriswell> hexblaze: Best bet would be just to ask in general. No reason to direct it at anyone.
[13:00:42] <BillCriswell> hexblaze: Can you replicate the issue somewhere else?
[13:00:54] <hexblaze> should i make a gist an link?
[13:01:07] <hexblaze> don't want to be spamming ..
[13:01:11] <BLeg> BillCriswell: No... only in my test environment that I can't share on grounds of NDA
[13:01:16] <BillCriswell> Yes. That'll work.
[13:01:28] <BillCriswell> jsfiddle.net might be helpful as well hexblaze.
[13:01:29] <BLeg> BillCriswell: It worked great when I jsfiddle'd it lol
[13:01:39] <hexblaze> thanks .. will do that
[13:01:46] <BillCriswell> BLeg: Haha, well there you go. You know something else is up with it.
[13:02:03] <BillCriswell> One step closer to an answer.
[13:02:46] <BLeg> BillCriswell: Yeah, Drupal's up with it...

[13:36:04] <andrew9184> can you set height 100% with jquery ?
[13:36:11] <hexblaze> yes
[13:36:14] <scar> yeah using .css()
[13:36:15] <hexblaze> cdd
[13:36:17] <scar> i imagine
[13:36:19] <hexblaze> yeah
[13:36:24] <hexblaze> as scar said
[13:36:34] <scar> cdd is phased out :P
[13:36:38] <hexblaze> css({height:"100%"})
[13:36:52] <hexblaze> :p
[13:36:53] <scar> woudln't it be .css('height', '100%') ?
[13:36:58] <hexblaze> yeah
[13:36:59] <hexblaze> indeed
[13:37:05] <scar> do both methods work?
[13:37:08] <hexblaze> no
[13:37:11] <andrew9184> it doesn't work
[13:37:17] <andrew9184> ah need the {}
[13:37:17] <hexblaze> use scar's fix
[13:37:27] <ravenzz> scar yes
[13:37:36] <andrew9184> css('height','100%') didnt work though
[13:37:43] <scar> is one better than the other?
[13:37:48] <ravenzz> scar no.
[13:37:55] <Alecoalec> scar: you think you could help me out?
[13:38:01] <scar> andrew9184: did you use .css() or css() ? lol
[13:38:07] <Alecoalec> please :)
[13:38:26] <scar> Alecoalec: depends on what you want help with. i don't move furniture.
[13:38:44] <dblosevn_> i move furniture for 200 an hour
[13:38:48] <hexblaze> using a string
[13:38:55] <hexblaze> would avoid errors like
[13:38:58] <hexblaze> wtf is -
[13:38:58] <ravenzz> andrew9184 height: 100%; works only if the parent has an height
[13:39:03] <dblosevn_> dont get many gigs though lmao
[13:39:31] <scar> dblosevn_: in texas summer heat? haha
[13:39:41] <hexblaze> cause css rules have retarded - (like in min-height for example) that i think shouldn't be there ..
[13:39:44] <dblosevn_> scar: no 250 an hour for texas
[13:40:01] <scar> we have mexicans out here though.
[13:40:09] <scar> and they pad the furniture too :D
[13:40:10] <dblosevn_> plus airfare and truck rental from florida lmao
[13:40:10] <andrew9184> okay it worked in fiddle
[13:40:12] <Alecoalec> scar: I was actually going to ask you to move my lazy boy, but nevermind.
[13:40:15] <andrew9184> ah okay, thanks ravenzz
[13:40:37] <Alecoalec> scar: in all seriousness. check your PM for a live link
[13:40:55] <scar> dblosevn_: i'll just get one that came from the border lol. funny all of southern texas is democrat bc of the mexican population lol
[13:40:59] <scar> im in dallas though, and im not racist :D
[13:41:01] <hexblaze> can you guys see anything wrong with this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/ahTCW/3/
[13:41:02] <shoky> hexblaze: the prob with your autocomplete has to do with the 'of' option in the 'position'
[13:41:10] <hexblaze> really?
[13:41:12] <shoky> yea
[13:41:20] <scar> Alecoalec: i see the link
[13:41:20] <enderx86> Is the following a JSON? {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
[13:41:28] <hexblaze> ah well that's in the fiddle
[13:41:34] <hexblaze> but that selector is valid in my application
[13:41:34] <shoky> i'm not sure how it's supposed to be used so i donno what the best fix is, or what you're trying to do with it anyway
[13:41:40] <Alecoalec> scar: so basically click on the other pictures, like the second third or fourth one
[13:41:46] <dblosevn_> enderx86: yes that is "a json" ,,,
[13:41:47] <hexblaze> well the problem is the focus event
[13:41:51] <Alecoalec> and you'll see how it moves to the right before it animates, how would I stop that.
[13:41:52] <hexblaze> it litterally doesn't do anything
[13:41:52] <ravenzz> enderx86 no
[13:42:01] <dblosevn_> lmao
[13:42:02] <enderx86> ravenzz: i think dblosevn_ is right
[13:42:09] <Alecoalec> I knoe it's an easy fix... I just don't know it
[13:42:15] <scar> ok
[13:42:15] <hexblaze> shoky: focus event causes a typeerror
[13:42:17] <shoky> hexblaze: http://jsfiddle.net/ahTCW/5/
[13:42:25] <shoky> focus event?
[13:42:26] <dblosevn_> enderx86: technically that is json it is not a json
[13:42:31] <shoky> i get an error when typing something..
[13:42:32] <scar> what do you mean?
[13:42:38] <enderx86> i want to encode an integer array as a json
[13:42:45] <enderx86> it will be returned by an ajax call
[13:42:46] <hexblaze> shoky: on focusing with keyboard , default behaviour is to replace the text of the input with the box value
[13:42:55] <scar> what browser are you using? i click it and it seems to slide fine, Alecoalec
[13:43:00] <dblosevn_> var myvar = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
[13:43:01] <Alecoalec> Chrome
[13:43:20] <dblosevn_> @enderx86
[13:43:32] <enderx86> dblosevn_ i am writing this in a java servlet. it will be returned by an ajax call.
[13:43:37] <scar> looks like you have a swing effect or something right? i dont see any movement to the right though. it all looks fluid.
[13:43:47] <enderx86> would the ajax call be able to recognize '[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]' as a json?
[13:43:55] <dblosevn_> enderx86: {} is object notation [] is array notation
[13:44:00] <Alecoalec> scar: everything slides fine, it's just when you click on lets say the 3rd one the fourth image would move to the right to resize it'd be better if it stayed its place
[13:44:14] <enderx86> dblosevn_ would the datatype field in my ajax call be 'json'?
[13:44:19] <Alecoalec> especially the fourth image
[13:44:26] <dblosevn_> enderx86: yes
[13:44:28] <kristofers> I have a one page website layout, and when i click on an anchor link in the navigation since the header is fixed it displays it too low shouldn't scrollTop do the trick ?
[13:44:31] <enderx86> ok thanks
[13:44:39] <hexblaze> shoky: if still not clear .. what i mean literally is when autocomplete box is open .. i am meant to be able to scroll down with down arrow and the input text changes to whatever i am scrolled out
[13:44:54] <dblosevn_> enderx86: or you could do, {"myarray" : [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]}
[13:45:12] <dblosevn_> then in the response response.myarray
[13:45:13] <shoky> hexblaze: uhh oks, donno much about that sry ;P
[13:45:25] <hexblaze> shoky: thanks anyways man!
[13:45:34] <shoky> np
[13:45:52] <ravenzz> enderx86 { "name" : "value" } is a valid json string
[13:46:12] <dblosevn_> ravenzz: he confused {} with []
[13:46:20] <enderx86> i'm not confusing the two
[13:46:26] <ravenzz> k
[13:46:29] <dblosevn_> ravenzz: was trying to make an array but used object notation
[13:46:31] <scar> Alecoalec: i cannot replicate your issue.
[13:46:36] <enderx86> i simply have to pass a LIST OF INTEGER VALUES back to an ajax call, i'm wondering whether i should use {} or [], the datatype has to be json
[13:47:02] <dblosevn_> ?g json for beginners @enderx86
[13:47:03] <bot-t> enderx86, Data for journalists: JSON for beginners | Online Journalism Blog - http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2011/04/14/data-for-journalists-json-for-beginners/
[13:47:07] <hexblaze> it  makes sense to use an array if your values are not too sparse
[13:47:16] <Alecoalec> scar: all you have to do is click on the 4th image you'll see the 4th one move to the first row of images then rezise
[13:47:22] <hexblaze> this is just comparing two data structures for a task
[13:47:23] <Alecoalec> It's got something to do with the width of the img box
[13:49:23] <dblosevn_> enderx86: sorry google failed lol http://json.org/ read up on json
[13:51:46] <dblosevn_> grr my scrape is taking FOREVER to complete and im stuck waiting on it before i can move on
[13:51:50] <scar> oh
[13:52:12] <scar> now the 4th image is on the bottom row. they were all on the same row until now. weird.
[13:53:44] <hexblaze> ah .. this fiddle is impossible to fix! all i want is to focus on the autocomplete and have the textbox change : http://jsfiddle.net/ahTCW/3/
[14:05:28] <dblosevn_> hexblaze: just want to focus the autocomplete? http://jsfiddle.net/ahTCW/8/
[14:06:13] <hansol> best jquery image gallery ?
[14:06:28] <ryanneufeld> hansol: this isn't google
[14:06:30] <hansol> âlbûm8
[14:06:53] <dblosevn_> ?english @hansol
[14:06:53] <bot-t> hansol, Ingles por favor English Please Anglais s'il vous plait Englisch bitte..
[14:06:58] <dblosevn_> lmao
[14:07:50] <hansol> easy install jquery album ?
[14:07:55] <hansol> thx
[14:08:48] <shoky> hexblaze: http://jsfiddle.net/ahTCW/9/
[14:09:18] <shoky> hexblaze:  changed self._renderItem to self._renderItemData  as per the example on http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#categories
[14:09:19] <chachan> guys, what could it be happening in here? http://jsfiddle.net/chachan/6B5zX/
[14:09:34] <chachan> I also tried without encodeURI
[14:10:00] <dblosevn_> shoky: wow totally didnt understand hhis question lol thats actually pretty tight
[14:10:04] <winux> I have a function binded to the load event for a box that loads images, but it only fires the first time an image is loaded. How would I have it fire each time a new image is loaded???
[14:10:27] <hexblaze> shoky:wtf? it works! so it's the structure of the html that's cauing jquery ui not to parse the item on focus then?
[14:10:47] <ryanneufeld> hansol: This is not a search engine. If you have a specific question, please ask it.
[14:11:02] <hexblaze> actually it's potentially the best search engine ever
[14:11:05] <shoky> hexblaze: i don't really know the internals, i just know how to follow examples ;]
[14:11:20] <hexblaze> shoky: haha cheers!
[14:11:24] <shoky> ;]
[14:12:21] <chachan> winux, can you show us the code?, you are probably overwritting the object (wiping out the binded one)
[14:12:50] <winux> chachan: yes, one second
[14:14:18] <winux> chachan: actually I will do some more research around what you just said
[14:16:33] <chachan> you might want to store the function and then bind objects after loaded. Of course you will need to bind the first one "manually"
[14:17:28] <chachan> winux, ^
[14:18:00] <winux> chachan: yeah that is a good idea too. i just noticed the function actually does fire (after sticking in some alerts), but the resizing does not occur.. so it''s probably the function itself
[14:44:41] <Alecoalec> http://dope.com/magento/index.php/dope-logo-camo-strapback-hat.html
[14:44:54] <Alecoalec> Can anyone tell me why the fourth image shakes after enlarging it
[14:49:43] <joshsmith> hey all, I'm considering something like this, but working it on a single element http://bseth99.github.com/projects/animate/A-tweenlite-exploding-effect.html
[14:49:56] <joshsmith> this is not really an easy answer, more of an explorative thing
[14:50:29] <joshsmith> I was thinking the only way I could do it is to clone an element multiple times with offsets to make up a sort of puzzle configuration of elements
[14:50:38] <joshsmith> but that seems like it would be very deleterious performance-wise
[14:50:50] <joshsmith> especially when doing the exploding effect
[14:51:22] <joshsmith> and jQuery UI's explode is pretty lame
[14:51:58] <Caelum> when you validate a form, what's better, to have an alert for the first error you find, or make a popup with all errors you find?
[15:01:34] <joshsmith> Caelum: inline alerts with all the errors
[15:01:42] <joshsmith> ever seen how Rails handles form validation?
[15:02:26] <Caelum> joshsmith: nope don't know anything about rails
[15:04:31] <Caelum> joshsmith: what do you mean by inline alerts?
[15:04:59] <joshsmith> I mean you render a whole list of alerts
[15:06:10] <Caelum> joshsmith: ok, I see, thanks
[15:06:27] <Caelum> by alert I meant I am using the js alert() function to make a popup
[15:06:39] <Caelum> but I should probably use a jquery ui popup plugin instead
[15:09:54] <joshsmith> I wouldn't even render a popup Caelum
[15:10:00] <joshsmith> render it on the same page
[15:10:58] <Caelum> that's what most people do, but I like a popup for this, it's more GUI-ish
[15:12:00] <Caelum> also, on another topic, does .val('foo') return the old value?
[15:12:17] <Caelum> can I do: var old_val = $('#id').val('newval');
[15:12:38] <joshsmith> I don't think so, no
[15:12:48] <joshsmith> I think the operation happens before the assignment
[15:12:49] <JessC> I think you can do: $('#id').defaultValue;
[15:14:54] <JessC> oops: $('#id')[0].defaultValue;
[15:15:27] <JessC> but that would only display what was originally set as the value and not the history of values
[15:15:42] <JessC> eg if the user kept on changing the value it wouldn't show you the last just its original value
[15:15:56] <Caelum> JessC: cool, thanks!
[15:25:33] <kristofers> What is scrollTop() supposed to do ?
[15:29:27] <tw2113> ?scrollTop @ kristofers
[15:29:28] <bot-t> kristofers, .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[15:29:38] <kristofers> Can anyone help me figure out how they managed to get that spacing above the Heading
[15:30:12] <kristofers> I know that the header is the problem since it's fixed

[15:47:21] <jimmv> hi.. why im not able to initialize my autocomplete fields when i add a new row in my table http://jsfiddle.net/4XZMb/953/
[15:47:28] <fugly> moin.
[15:53:27] <Guest47795> $("#my-select").val(myVal);  // doesn't work
[15:53:37] <Guest47795> how do I set a select dropdown by value ?
[15:54:15] <niels__> Guest47795: var goodvalue = $("#my-select).val();
[15:54:44] <niels__> or.. i'm not sure what u meant
[15:55:59] <niels__> i'm trying to use .each() but i'm obviously doing it wrong. my ajax is returning my json object perfectly fine, but i can't do the iteration? http://pastebin.com/FvAPS7Uz what am i missing? :(
[15:56:54] <imsky> you sure it's getting parsed as json?
[15:57:01] <imsky> it posts as just /ajax/types
[15:57:30] <coachz> hi, can anyone tell me pros and cons of using a js grid over a php grid ?
[15:57:39] <niels__> imsky: i've posted the object in that pastebin, sure looks like json to me
[15:57:48] <imsky> yeah does JQUERY see it as json though
[15:57:53] <imsky> do a console log of j first
[15:58:03] <imsky> if you get text, it doesn't, if you get object notation then it does
[15:58:57] <coachz> how come with my document ready if i use $. i get undefined but if i use jQuery. no error ?
[15:59:10] <niels__> imsky: it get text
[15:59:10] <niels__> '
[15:59:17] <imsky> niels__: ok make sure contentType is json then
[15:59:24] <imsky> and you should be good to go, assuming there are no json errors
[16:00:29] <jimmv> hi.. why im not able to initialize my autocomplete fields when i add a new row in my table what im i missing here http://jsfiddle.net/4XZMb/953/
[16:01:30] <niels__> imsky: contentType:"application/json; charset=utf-8", dataType:"json" still returns text
[16:01:43] <niels__> imsky: should i set a header in my php?
[16:01:47] <imsky> yeah
[16:01:55] <imsky> it shouldn't matter but who knows
[16:02:07] <Guest47795> niels__: you just opened my eyes.
[16:02:13] <Guest47795> thanks pal :P
[16:04:02] <niels__> imsky: weird, the header('Content-Type: application/x-json; charset=utf-8'); in my php controller did it. thanks
[16:04:14] <imsky> yeah np
[16:12:29] <jimmv> =/
[16:32:50] <dogarrhea> is there a selector that finds all elements with text equal to some value?
[16:33:20] <dogarrhea> so in a div, i want to search the div text, same with anchor links buttons etc
[16:33:49] <dogarrhea> basically, return the element whose text is some value
[16:37:19] <imsky> yes
[16:37:27] <imsky> $("div:contains('hello')")
[16:53:48] <ronson> I have a really complicated issue
[16:54:14] <ronson> On page load, I do an ajax load to another page, I get the contents and dump it into my page
[16:54:31] <ronson> Now none of my js event handlers or code runs on this newly generated markup
[16:54:45] <ronson> all my code uses .on( ) however... does anyone know?
[17:01:14] <someprimetime> got serious gas but i'm still at work
[17:11:29] <webguynow> I was trying to capture a mouse click on iframe, by creating an overlay and coding the 'click' event for the overlay.
[17:11:55] <webguynow> Along with z-index  I was hoping this would work
[17:12:26] <webguynow> Only browser it is working in is Chrome.  Any suggestions for FF or IE ?
[17:12:35] <webguynow> I can link to the code if that helps
[17:16:48] <someprimetime> post fiddle
[17:21:14] <webguynow> can do, brb
[17:26:09] <someprimetime> ronson: what are you delegating on?
[17:26:10] <someprimetime> what element?
[17:30:25] <webguynow> Capture a click over an iframe, using an overlay div (only worked in Chrome), but here's a jsfiddle
[17:30:29] <webguynow> http://jsfiddle.net/8nH8q/
[17:40:03] <someprimetime> so what's wrong with it?
[17:40:44] <someprimetime> webguynow: ^^
[17:42:55] <kristofers> I'm going nuts, i went over this site's css, jss html strcture i still can't figure out how it's working correctly for them
[17:42:55] <kristofers> http://pitch.csspiffle.com/#problem
[17:43:23] <kristofers> On my site which works the same way the anchor being linked it appears too far up
[17:44:12] <tw2113> what's the link to yours?
[17:44:38] <kristofers> it's local
[17:45:25] <kristofers> uploading it to a domain
[17:45:26] <tw2113> man, now i want to poke their scripts and find out where/how the pull the top/bottom menu off screen when not scrolling
[17:46:28] <kristofers> That menu is by default -50
[17:46:38] <kristofers> maybe that's why it's not happening to them like it is to me
[17:52:55] <someprimetime> the heck are they doing with all that .class nonsense
[17:53:21] <kristofers> csspiffle ?
[17:53:32] <someprimetime> yes
[17:54:44] <tw2113> driving you cray someprimetime
[17:54:50] <someprimetime>  it's just like.. stop trying to add the whole Class naming convention into js /rant
[17:55:00] <someprimetime> tw2113: it's overcookin my grits
[17:55:15] <someprimetime> otherwise +1 on that site
[17:58:38] <MistuhKurtz> hm tw2113, instead why don't you describe how -you- would approach hiding the menu when not scrolling
[17:58:50] <MistuhKurtz> because now I'm curious as well and don't want to look through all the code
[17:58:50] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[17:59:20] <tw2113> from what i saw, it just adds a class to the body tag when scrolling
[17:59:24] <MistuhKurtz> yeah just noticed that too
[17:59:30] <tw2113> and with that class it sets an opacity to 1 or so
[17:59:31] <MistuhKurtz> probably uses a CSS3 transition
[17:59:56] <MistuhKurtz> er, yes it does.
[17:59:57] <tw2113> but i like the effect of freeing up some screen real estate
[18:00:36] <MistuhKurtz> then a timeout to remove the scrolling class, and the scroll event clears that timeout?
[18:00:51] <someprimetime> probably
[18:01:31] <tw2113> most likely
[18:01:31] <tw2113> i don't have a huge amount of js-fu to confirm that
[18:02:46] <kristofers> http://thrijda.com
[18:03:38] <tw2113> kristofers, and you want the centered bulb-ish spots to not be under the menu?
[18:03:45] <kristofers> yeah
[18:06:26] <kristofers> i'm trying to keep the html clean i've googled it and seen people adding anchor above the div and adding some margin and padding
[18:06:37] <kristofers> but i don't want it that way
[18:07:06] <MistuhKurtz> hm
[18:07:09] <MistuhKurtz> I don't think they clearTimeout
[18:07:16] <MistuhKurtz> or use a timeout, rather
[18:07:32] <MistuhKurtz> so what other way...
[18:07:46] <tw2113> long fade transition MistuhKurtz ?
[18:08:35] <tw2113> this.blocker = new ExtendingBlocker(1000);
[18:09:01] <tw2113> seems to fade out after about 1 second
[18:10:17] <MistuhKurtz> this.$window.bind(this.blocker.EVENT_UNBLOCK, $.proxy(this.clearScrolling_, this));
[18:11:58] <kristofers> That menu is by default top: -50, and then the jquery slide
[18:12:12] <kristofers> slide's it down when moving mouse but there is still alot of space between there
[18:12:58] <MistuhKurtz> hah so it is using a timeout
[18:13:02] <MistuhKurtz> it's just very abstracted
[18:13:21] <MistuhKurtz> and I am much too tired to try and understand it completely
[18:13:22] <MistuhKurtz> :P

[18:22:18] <webguynow> on click, I try to replace the window(html) with the .pdf
[18:23:44] <kristofers> I'm starting to dislike that site XD
[18:26:31] <ackpacket> I have a container with many elements, some of which having the class "
[18:26:33] <ackpacket> whoops
[18:27:35] <ackpacket> i have a container with many elements, some of which have the class "testClass".  When one of the .testClass elements is clicked, how can I select every sibling with .testClass, EXCEPT the first .testClass sibling found after the clicked element?
[18:27:59] <webguynow> If I could get click to work on FF/IE browser(s), that' would be great.
[18:28:59] <ackpacket> webguynow: $('p').click(function() {alert('click works!');});
[18:29:14] <ackpacket> paste that into your js and try clicking something between a <p></p>
[18:29:15] <therealklanni> Is there a way to get a callback when a widget has been initialized? Using jQuery UI widget factory
[18:30:08] <webguynow> right ack - I think it's browser specific, actually
[18:30:20] <ackpacket> for jquery O.o?
[18:30:36] <webguynow> and normally clicks on a iframe are supposed to interact with the page/source of the iframe
[18:30:39] <ackpacket> i thought one of the purposes of jquery was to let the framework handle the browser specificity
[18:30:48] <ackpacket> anyways, $('something').click() works fine for me in FF
[18:31:08] <ackpacket> And opera on my smartphone
[18:31:09] <webguynow> that's why I created an overlay to capture the click event, and size it over the iframe .pdf
[18:31:43] <ackpacket> oooh... iframe's have a nasty tendency of screwing with z-indices and mouse events behaving unexpectedkly
[18:32:20] <tw2113> iframes are bastards in general
[18:34:30] <ackpacket> Yeah, what is it you're trying to accomplish overall webguy?  Generally you're not supposed to have access to iframe events and other things for a good reason
[18:36:22] <ackpacket> When a paragraph is clicked, how can I select all the paragraphs on the page EXCEPT the first one found after the clicked one?  It may or may not be an adjacent sibling
[18:53:45] <webguynow> just trying to do a cool page - showing the pdf in the iframe, but if they click it, have it fill the whole window
[18:54:39] <webguynow> I read something about this in FF, and you have to enable something  Parent.acceptClicks  or something like that
[19:46:07] <gabrieluk> hi, i'm looking at this page http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/ . what is the catch between "getter" and "setter"?
[19:49:46] <gabrieluk> got it, kinda of method to override the first value
[19:49:46] <gabrieluk> {
[19:49:46] <gabrieluk>     getValue: function(){
[19:49:46] <gabrieluk>         return this._value;
[19:49:46] <gabrieluk>     },
[19:49:47] <gabrieluk>     setValue: function(val){
[19:49:49] <gabrieluk>         this._value = val;
[19:49:51] <gabrieluk>     }
[19:49:53] <gabrieluk> }
[19:49:55] <gabrieluk> ugh, sry
[19:51:26] <versatiletech> I used to have a firebug plugin where I could see all of the events attached to an element. I don't think it was FireQuery. Do you guys know of any?
[19:53:02] <JessC> @versatiletec http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event
[19:53:10] <JessC> I've used that one from time to time
[19:54:34] <JessC> @versatiletech*
[19:54:45] <gabrieluk> ahhh, now i really got it. getter and setter is to call the private variable within the object
[19:56:13] <versatiletech> JessC: thanks. Does it work for vanilla javascript?
[19:56:40] <JessC> @versatiletech yes, it grabs anything that has an event bound to it
[19:56:40] <b-ot> JessC, definitely being used as one ;)
[19:56:47] <versatiletech> sweet
[19:57:42] <JessC> @gabrieluk Usually you'd use the setters to modify the properties of the object after you created it. At least thats what I remember, been a little while since I used jquery ui
[19:58:43] <gabrieluk> yup, you are right, i know the concept from vanilla js. it feels good to know js before learning jquery
[19:58:54] <gabrieluk> i just couldn't connect
[19:59:36] <gabrieluk> JessC, nice article http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-getters-and-setters/
[20:00:27] <versatiletech> JessC: wow that's really nice the amount of functionality in just a bookmarklet. It could be a bit more intuitive though.
[20:00:50] <JessC> @versatiletech Yeah I've been working on my own version of that
[20:00:50] <b-ot> JessC, not tagged as amd within that containing module's build profile script?
[20:01:15] <JessC> @b-ot?
[20:03:50] <JessC> @versatiletech one thing that i've noticed is that it won't catch events on dom elements inserted after the initial page load, it could be browser specific though. One day I will finish my script and post it on github
[20:05:07] <versatiletech> yeah
[20:05:21] <versatiletech> could you push what you have already so that I could watch that repo?
[20:06:05] <versatiletech> I want to be able to grab it in the future when you're done with it
[20:07:50] <JessC> will do

[23:24:00] <binaryfus10nz> thoughts on full scrolling sites? http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2012/07/parallax-scrolling.html
[23:31:13] <binaryfus10nz> if you look at JS at footer source on this site... http://www.bagigia.com/index.php .. bad practice to use multiple doc readys and includes, or good way to be modular?
