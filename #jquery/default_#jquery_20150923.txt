[00:00:24] * Cork happily puts lenswipee in the support leach list
[00:00:39] <lenswipee> Uhkis: and i dont know how to append other type of data.

[00:01:20] <Uhkis> ?g jquery ajax upload
[00:01:20] <b-ot> Uhkis: Simple File Uploads Using jQuery & AJAX - Abandon - Abban Dunne â†’ http://abandon.ie/notebook/simple-file-uploads-using-jquery-ajax
[00:04:58] <lenswipee> Uhkis: thanks heaps!
[00:05:22] <Uhkis> that also used formdata btw
[00:05:31] <lenswipee> Uhkis: oh no!
[00:07:40] <lenswipee> event.stopPropagation();   event.preventDefault(); <-- why both?
[00:08:17] <Uhkis> first one stops bubbling, second one default behaviour
[00:52:27] <ohcibi> is it possible to prevent selectboxit from actually selecting the element and showing it in the combobox after clicking? I want the defaultText to always be visible no matter what was clicked, do I need to reselect default after an option was clicked?
[01:09:37] <Shaggoth> hi all, this do not work, where i am wrong ? $(".modifpole0").offset({ top: ""+pole0top+"", left: ""+pole0left+"" });
[01:09:46] <Shaggoth> where var pole0top = document.getElementById('pole0').offsetHeight;
[01:09:48] <Shaggoth> var pole0left = document.getElementById('pole0').offsetLeft;
[01:10:17] <Shaggoth> pole0top and pole0Left return value
[01:10:26] <Cork> .offset doesn't take values
[01:10:39] <guessx> "'+var+'"?
[01:10:48] <Cork> if you want to set the top left you use .css
[01:10:53] <Cork> not .offset
[01:11:12] <Shaggoth> k i thought it works
[01:11:15] <Shaggoth> ty guy
[01:11:36] <Cork> offsetHeight is read only too
[01:11:49] <Cork> for for the same reason you can't use .offset()
[01:12:20] <Shaggoth> but in http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[01:12:29] <Shaggoth> you can see $( "p:last" ).offset({ top: 10, left: 30 });
[01:13:02] <Shaggoth> why so ?
[01:13:04] <Cork> ugg they've added examples inbetween...
[01:13:23] <Cork> well top left should be a number, not a string
[01:13:39] <Shaggoth> and not a js var ?
[01:13:44] <Cork> so $(".modifpole0").offset({ top: pole0top, left: pole0left });
[01:13:51] <Cork> js vars isn't all strings...
[01:14:15] <Shaggoth> i tried $(".modifpole0").offset({ top: pole0top, left: pole0left }); at first
[01:14:31] <Shaggoth> doesnt work
[01:14:35] <Shaggoth> made me mad
[01:14:43] <Shaggoth> doesnt know why
[01:16:18] <Shaggoth> and my vars are no string cause i wrote there above

[01:16:30] <Shaggoth> ty Cork
[01:18:00] <Shaggoth> nice guy exactly what i want ty so much !
[01:26:39] <STFUn00b> hi guys... this is not a jquery related question, but maybe someone can help. i have a tabbed content with links... when i click on a link some page opens, then i click back button. now i want the tab with the clicked link to be selected on page load
[01:27:05] <STFUn00b> i know it can be done with cookies or local storage and some js
[01:27:30] <STFUn00b> is there any simpler method? or any other best practices for that kind of problem?
[01:29:02] <halvors> Hi!.
[01:29:07] <sonnie> hi there, I want to assign a unique ID for each row. Currently my data is assigned from an array.
[01:30:21] <halvors> I have a problem with mu jquery script, i have multiplie forms on the page, i want when clicking on a checkbox that the form is posted, this works as espected, but if i have mutiplie forms it only posts the first one no matter if the checkbox is not in that form.
[01:30:50] <halvors> .event-checklist-check is the class of the forms.
[01:30:58] <halvors> Here is my current code: http://pastebin.com/e3hZPZxM
[01:31:47] <DarsVaeda> if I do element.on('click', 'a'... can I get the index of the clicked links of all links?
[01:32:33] <halvors> I got the jsfiddle for this: http://jsfiddle.net/e8zwdm7w/2/
[01:32:43] <halvors> But somehow that doesn't work for me :(
[01:33:04] <Cork> DarsVaeda: $('a').index(this)
[01:34:51] <DarsVaeda> hmm so I used the right thing, but it gives me 17 when there are just 3 links...it must be another index?
[01:35:29] <Cork> DarsVaeda: $('a').length is?
[01:37:05] <DarsVaeda> 32, so it returns the index in all links not just all of that element
[01:37:28] <Cork> yes
[01:37:45] <Cork> DarsVaeda: element.find('a') will give you just the child links
[01:39:24] <DarsVaeda> I thought .index(selector) can do that
[01:39:52] <Cork> no that returns the index matching the selector
[01:40:02] <Cork> it doesn't limit what is searched for
[01:40:54] <DarsVaeda> I need to re-read the docu :/
[01:45:21] <Shaggoth> Pourquoi quand je met une div en absolute via offset elle laisse un trou de le Dom a son emplacement initial, peut on l'enlever ?$
[01:46:36] <Cork> Shaggoth: english please
[01:46:41] <Uhkis> sacrebleu! baguette!
[01:46:55] <Shaggoth> oups sorry ^^
[01:47:39] <Shaggoth> i said why did my div let a hole in its first place after an offset and how remove it ?
[01:47:57] <Shaggoth> Uhkis: baguette pinard et fromton !
[01:48:20] <Cork> shennyg: depends on your css, you would have to make a jsfiddle to get an answer to that
[01:48:42] <Uhkis> Shaggoth: varmasti
[01:50:50] <Shaggoth> Uhkis: cognac
[01:54:28] <Shaggoth> Cork: c'est bourrÃ© de php aussi :/
[01:55:22] <Uhkis> not sure if trolling..
[01:55:47] <Cork> i start to think yes, ya
[01:55:50] <Shaggoth> merde a chaque fois je reviens a ma langue natale :p
[01:56:18] <Shaggoth> i said i'ts full of php not sure jsfidlle like that
[01:57:03] <Uhkis> just copy paste the rendered html..
[01:57:44] <EugenA> is it possible to temporarily disable onclick="..." in a-elements?
[01:59:16] <EugenA> or add additional checks to allow / not allow execution of code in onclick="..". I have many a-elements, so I don't want to change them all
[01:59:40] <EugenA> I'd like to define one logic for all a-elements
[01:59:46] <EugenA> is it possible?
[02:01:20] <Shaggoth> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/0pcf87wm/2/
[02:01:41] <Cork> EugenA: never use onclick
[02:01:42] <Cork> ever
[02:02:19] <Cork> in an event handler you could add a check for if ex. data('disabled') is true
[02:02:50] <Cork> or you could store the function reference and remove the old event handler temporarily (bad idea)
[02:05:42] <EugenA> ok, thanks
[02:18:15] <PickAndMix> Cork: what's wrong with onclick
[02:18:34] <Cork> PickAndMix: onclick is dom0 it is not compatible with event handlers
[02:18:44] <Cork> and things will break all over the place if you ever need to use both
[02:18:55] <Cork> it also requires eval to work
[02:19:01] <Cork> and that is something you should never use
[02:19:18] <Cork> it also doesn't support scope, so everything has to be in the global scope
[02:19:25] <Cork> should i continue? :D
[02:19:29] <Uhkis> and inline anything makes stuff more complicated to maintain/debug
[02:19:43] <Cork> the list just goes on and on
[02:19:57] <Cork> there are a ton of reasons why you should never use onclick
[02:20:16] <Cork> the bigger one for me is that you can't use csp if you do
[02:24:58] <PCatinean> Hey guys, I do a simple $('#id').val('blabla'); and the function hits but the value is not updated
[02:25:07] <PCatinean> Any frequent reason why this happens?
[02:25:39] <Cork> PCatinean: 1. you have two elements with the same id, 2. the element isn't an input field
[02:25:48] <Cork> or rather form field
[02:25:58] <PCatinean> it's a simple span :-s
[02:25:59] <PCatinean> no bueno?
[02:26:04] <PCatinean> I shoul do text or html?
[02:32:37] <Cork> PCatinean: .text if you want to make sure to escape what you add
[02:32:45] <PCatinean> Cork, done, thanks!
[02:32:48] <Cork> PCatinean: or .html() if you want to be able to include html
[02:50:39] <PCatinean> Cork, in order to iterate over an array that has an id and a string and build two divs with the values and place them in another div?
[02:51:00] <PCatinean> How one should go about it? I assume the elements are created with jquery not with raw html
[02:51:49] <PCatinean> Not like this var div = $('<div></div>').addClass('bar').text('bla')?
[02:52:21] <Cork> var result = $('<div>').append($.map(arr, function(i, value) { return $('<div>').text(value).attr('id', 's' + i); }));
[02:52:42] <PCatinean> holy sh*t :O
[02:52:53] <PCatinean> You've been working with Jquery for quite some time
[02:53:45] <PCatinean> Though I need a div with a certain class for the first element and a div with another class on the second
[02:53:50] <PCatinean> should I use each?
[02:54:16] <Cork> PCatinean: check the i in the loop
[02:54:29] <PCatinean> 0 or 1
[02:54:30] <ULTafk> hi!
[02:54:32] <PCatinean> and if condition, got it
[02:54:35] <PCatinean> thanks!
[02:54:41] <Cork> (i < 1 ? 'class1' : 'class2')
[02:54:56] <ULTafk> my code is now running correct on change.
[02:55:22] <ULTafk> but what I want is that it is also running after loading the page. onload
[02:55:41] <ULTafk> What is the best way to achieve this?
[02:56:13] <Cork> ?api ready
[02:56:13] <b-ot> Cork: .ready(): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[02:56:22] <ULTafk> Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ultimatia/8222jm8x/4/   >> when selecting an option you see in summary the selected option
[02:56:43] <ULTafk> yeah, I tried that Cork
[02:57:18] <ULTafk> it was a anonymous function. I could specify the function. Maybe that is working.
[03:01:13] <PCatinean> Cork, sorry confusion, each element has two values and element[0] goes in one div and element[1] goes in another
[03:01:28] <PCatinean> That makes two divs (which are bootstrap divs that are supposed to fit perfectly using the col-xs class)
[03:02:27] <PCatinean> http://hastebin.com/supaxehilo.coffee
[03:02:41] <PCatinean> so two sibling divs
[03:03:31] <ULTafk> you mean something like this Cork? http://jsfiddle.net/ultimatia/8222jm8x/5/
[03:03:42] <ULTafk> http://jsfiddle.net/ultimatia/8222jm8x/4/ is working
[03:03:48] <PCatinean> small problem forget about class
[03:04:43] <PCatinean> also frogot about <> in div

[04:17:24] <prohobo> hmmm
[04:17:38] <prohobo> would anyone know if its possible to have selectable svg rects using jquery?
[04:18:26] <prohobo> i really want to select some rects
[04:20:30] <Cork> prohobo: if you mean if jquery can work with a svg dom, then yes it can
[04:21:42] <prohobo> Cork: i mean to apply jquery ui's selectable to rects within an svg
[04:22:05] <Cork> prohobo: no, ui isn't compatible with svg
[04:22:10] <prohobo> goddommit
[04:22:21] <Cork> it expects to be able to inject divs into the dom
[04:22:50] <prohobo> looks like...
[04:22:54] * prohobo puts on shades
[04:22:59] <prohobo> its time to do it manually
[04:23:57] <taplar> *in gravelly anouncer voice* when the road less taken gets a little bumpy, prohobo goes......by the book
[04:24:21] <prohobo> lol
[04:24:26] <taplar> nah nana nah na
[04:25:36] <taplar> co staring Cork, the disembodied voice of reason
[04:25:49] <taplar> and taplar, who the f* is that guy?
[04:25:57] <taplar> this fall, 2015!
[04:26:06] <prohobo> together, they will show the DOM who's boss
[04:26:20] <taplar> awww, i missed that one
[04:26:53] <prohobo> im gonna fail miserably at this
[04:26:57] <prohobo> Cork get ready
[04:27:01] <prohobo> :P
[04:31:49] <Cork> prohobo: you could just use one of the ready written svg libs :)
[04:32:09] <Cork> like http://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/interactive-svg-components/draggable-svg-element
[04:38:56] <PCatinean> Cork, any idea why the elements are not nesting?
[04:38:57] <PCatinean> http://hastebin.com/ocupavaroh.coffee
[04:39:08] <PCatinean> btw i, element was the other way around
[04:40:21] <Cork> PCatinean: what elements are meant to nest?
[04:41:02] <PCatinean> div in div
[04:41:09] <Cork> also this line looks really weird cfg_price_div.append($('<div>').addClass('label label-info')).text(value[0]);
[04:41:21] <PCatinean> Yeah that's because I made it Xd
[04:41:35] <Cork> it adds a div child, followed by promptly replacing it with a text
[04:42:29] <`ULT> hi, does anyone an idea why this is not working onready? http://jsfiddle.net/ultimatia/8222jm8x/6/
[04:43:20] <`ULT> nvm, i think it can`t working onload.
[04:43:49] <`ULT> I need to try something else.
[04:45:08] <PCatinean> Cork, I wanted to add a div and that div should have that text
[04:45:20] <PCatinean> I thought that's how they stacked
[04:45:44] <Cork> you mean there should be a text in the div, followed by the child div?
[04:46:55] <PCatinean> <div class="col-sm-7 pull-right"><div class="label label-info">text-of-value[0]</div></div>
[04:46:59] <PCatinean> Something like that would be the final result
[04:47:21] <Cork> that isn't at all what you did
[04:47:46] <Cork> you did div class="col-sm-7 pull-right"><div class="label label-info"></div></div> and then replace the content of the outer div with text-of-value[0]
[04:48:01] <Cork> you want to set the text on the element you append, not the parent
[04:50:02] <PCatinean> I thought that's what I did
[04:50:10] <PCatinean> ah wait
[04:50:56] <PCatinean> Yeah missed that, thanks a lot Cork
[05:09:42] <`ULT> hi Cork, do you have some minutes to take a look and give maybe some advice?
[05:10:13] <Cork> if the question isn't too involved and you remove the tick :)
[05:10:29] <Cork> don't want to anger the bot :D
[05:11:14] <`ULT> I dont know exactely what you mean :p
[05:11:23] <Cork> ` <--
[05:11:26] <`ULT> aaah
[05:11:27] <`ULT> right!
[05:11:28] <`ULT> hahaa
[05:11:48] <`ULT> I need to register another name for ULT
[05:11:54] <`ULT> i cant me in some channels without the `
[05:12:00] <`ULT> *be
[05:12:05] <Cork> just group it with the old nick
[05:12:47] <Cork> /ns help group
[05:15:08] <ULT> hmm, that name looks to be registered already
[05:15:22] <taplar> ULTra
[05:15:44] <taplar> cULT
[05:15:48] <ULT> :p
[05:15:55] <ULT> hahaa nice ones
[05:16:59] <ULT> Oke, Cork I trie to explain what I want.
[05:17:03] <ULT> try
[05:19:47] <ULT> when a page load, I try to show the option title and option value title by html/ php.
[05:20:18] <ULT> When a option is changed, the option value title is updated by javascript/ jquery.
[05:21:11] <ULT> It is easy to show the title by php. but the preselected option value is harder to show. Is this possible, or do i need to use javascript for it?
[05:21:24] <ULT> This is what I mean: http://prntscr.com/8jjrmm
[05:21:37] <Kartagis> okay, let me ask something. my current structure is multiple .html pages and multiple .js pages. to load pages with ajax (for example login.html from index.html), do I need to strip everything but that div containing the page from login.html?
[05:21:44] <ULT> and this is what I have: http://jsfiddle.net/ultimatia/8222jm8x/6/
[05:22:38] <taplar> Kartagis: are you doing a SPA?
[05:22:57] <Kartagis> yeah, SPA for mobile?
[05:23:06] <Kartagis> s/\?//
[05:23:40] <taplar> yeah typically, or from what i've seen, with SPAs you'd have a landing page that had your head and body and such, and any views brought in would be just the pieces that would be injected into the body
[05:24:09] <Cork> ULT: not sure what you mean, you want to update the page title, or what title are you talking about?
[05:24:25] <ULT> do you have checked the screenshot?
[05:25:27] <ULT> I mean update the option value name when the selected option is changing. This is working correct in jquery.
[05:26:10] <ULT> But when I load for the first time the page, the preselected option values should be also in the summary
[05:26:51] <Cork> ULT: well you could trigger the js on page load
[05:26:56] <Cork> or you could do it server side
[05:27:17] <ULT> what do you prefer?
[05:27:24] <Kartagis> taplar: you mean landing page /and/ index.html?
[05:27:25] <ULT> server side or clientside
[05:27:27] <Cork> i prefer to only use js when it has to be used
[05:27:34] <Cork> js shouldn't fix server errors
[05:27:35] <Kartagis> or just index.html
[05:27:41] <ULT> yeah, and serverside when loading.
[05:27:42] <Kartagis> ?
[05:27:54] <Cork> ULT: unless js modify things
[05:28:18] <ULT> do you have any idea how i can achieve that with php?
[05:28:27] <Cork> meaning what the server sends should be correct, but if js changes things it can also update results from that
[05:28:27] <taplar> Kartagis: you'd have like an index.html page, and whatever else it could be login.html or login.view, or really login.spaz.  whatever, so long as ajax can get it
[05:28:28] <ULT> to only show the preselected option value name
[05:28:40] <Cork> ex. if js converts an input field to a slider, and snapps it into a step
[05:28:53] <Cork> it is fine that it also modifies other values that depend on that slider
[05:29:25] <ULT> true.
[05:29:30] <Cork> but ya, loading broken data and then fixing it in js isn't ok in my book
[05:29:54] <ULT> In php I have now this line:
[05:30:32] <ULT> http://paste.ofcode.org/XLGssG6g7qN3p47hFCxd75
[05:30:47] <Kartagis> seems like all I need is .load()
[05:31:08] <ULT> the part in the td is not correct, it shows all the values and not the selected value.
[05:31:39] <taplar> sure
[05:31:40] <Cork> ULT: so you have to calculate what that value would be
[05:31:55] <Cork> ULT: or don't render the page with filters at first
[05:31:58] <Kartagis> taplar: was that for me?
[05:32:11] <Cork> (meaning show all options and later add the filters through js)
[05:32:17] <taplar> yeah.  load is just a wrapper for ajax and inserting into dom.
[05:32:39] <ULT> This is the live example: http://www.kaskeus.nl/tuinkeus/index.php?route=product/product&path=32&product_id=340
[05:33:03] <Cork> $('selector').load(url) => $.get(url).done(function(data) { $('selector').html(data); });
[05:35:23] <ULT> maybe i can use $_POST to get the select option value from HTML
[05:35:47] <taplar> are you doing a post request?
[05:36:22] <ULT> no
[05:36:27] <Kartagis> taplar: then do I use this with onClick?
[05:36:29] <taplar> then $_POST will be empty
[05:36:40] <ULT> hmm true.
[05:37:04] <taplar> Kartagis: when and how to use it will be determined by your application on a case by case basis.
[05:37:11] <ULT> than I have no idea how i can retrieve the selected option with php
[05:37:29] <taplar> ULT: is it one of those parameters in the url?
[05:37:39] <ULT> no
[05:37:44] <ULT> also not.
[05:37:54] <taplar> so your not sending it at all.  so yeah, you can't get it
[05:38:04] <Kartagis> taplar: I mean, if I have buttons on index.html, do I use .load() onClick?
[05:38:24] <taplar> Kartagis: load has a complete callback that is optional.  you can do your future bindings in there
[05:38:37] <taplar> any setup that needs to happen to the newly inserted elements
[05:39:22] <ULT> oke so it is not possible in php you mean?
[05:39:48] <taplar> ULT: for php to know about a variable, you have to give it to it, either by the parameters or the content-body
[05:39:57] <taplar> otherwise, the request knows nothing about it
[05:40:14] <ULT> hmm.
[05:40:18] <taplar> that's true for any language that deals with an http request
[05:40:27] <ULT> allriht. that sucks :p
[05:40:54] <goodygum> hello
[05:40:55] <taplar> i guess i missed the conversation.  why can't you give the variable to the request?
[05:41:16] <ULT> you have checked what I want taplar?
[05:41:28] <taplar> wasn't paying close attention
[05:41:43] <ULT> oke I show you some links. My english is to bad to explain it clear.
[05:42:27] <ULT> What I want is this. Page loading -> show option title and preselected option value-name in a summary
[05:43:00] <ULT> change the content by changing a selected option > javascript > working
[05:43:09] <ULT> See fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ultimatia/8222jm8x/6/
[05:43:28] <ULT> Screenshot what I want by loading the page: http://prntscr.com/8jjrmm

[05:44:34] <voiter> is it possible to get the offset of a fixed element?
[05:44:53] <taplar> ULT: uh in your fiddle line 4 is wrong
[05:44:57] <taplar> that's not invoking anything
[05:45:30] <ULT> You mean: summary; //this calls it on load
[05:45:33] <Cork> voiter: .offset() works
[05:45:33] <taplar> yep
[05:45:45] <Cork> or was that position
[05:45:47] * Cork checks
[05:45:50] <ULT> true. I thougt that would be helping. but it is not. becouse of no this etcetera.
[05:46:07] <ULT> *because
[05:46:08] <taplar> no, it seems like your expecting it to execute which would be summary()
[05:46:19] <Cork> voiter: yes, .offset() works on fixed elements too
[05:46:23] <Cork> .position won't though
[05:46:28] <voiter> Cork, k, thanks
[05:46:35] <Kartagis> <a class="grayBtn" data-role="button" onClick="javascript:$('#contentHolder.index').load('apply.html #contentHolder.apply')" >BaÅŸvuru Yap</a> <--- is this wrong?
[05:46:42] <taplar> don't do that
[05:46:51] <Cork> voiter: note it will be the same value as css top and left though
[05:46:55] <taplar> decouple your js logic from your html
[05:46:59] <taplar> do your binding in js
[05:47:10] <voiter> Cork, ok, noted
[05:47:14] <Cork> as fixed elements is detached from the page
[05:47:25] <ULT> you mean there need to be summary() instead of summary ?
[05:47:36] <ULT> when do i need to use the () and when not?
[05:47:47] <ULT> becouse in the second part I dont need the ()
[05:47:49] <taplar> ULT: yes, for line 4.  the difference between line 4 and line 5 is that on line 4 your wanting to invoke it
[05:47:51] <ULT> (au
[05:48:08] <ULT> Oke, will google that.
[05:48:09] <taplar> but line 5, your giving a function reference to the event handler, -it- will execute it when the event happens
[05:48:17] <ULT> invoke
[05:48:23] <taplar> invoke = execute
[05:48:26] <taplar> = call
[05:48:28] <taplar> whatever, :)
[05:48:50] <ULT> haha thx :p
[05:48:50] <taplar> name() is a 'function invocation'
[05:49:10] <taplar> function name() {} is a 'function definition'
[05:49:20] <taplar> or just 'method'
[05:50:16] <ULT> I need to study that. I am always confused with that.
[05:50:16] <ExtraSteve> Is there a way I can change the action= attribute in a <form> depending on what one of the fields in the <form> is set to?
[05:50:17] <Cork> ULT: when you use a function name without () you reference, when you attach () you execute it
[05:50:25] <ULT> thx!
[05:50:39] <ULT> I understand it now.
[05:50:52] <goodygum> hi, i've got a JSON like this http://pastebin.com/ReTr8qS8 - how can I count 'status: error' elements which are closer to the root element of JSON file? I mean, I want to get a value of search i=3, instead of i=6
[05:51:00] <Cork> ULT: function example() { return true }; var z = example; z() == true
[05:52:08] <Cork> goodygum: you would have to loop the NeedAck array
[05:52:22] <taplar> ExtraSteve: sure, you can change it with prop on a change event on the fields in question
[05:52:39] <ExtraSteve> taplar: aah, I was trying to do it on submit instead
[05:52:42] <ExtraSteve> Maybe that's my problem
[05:52:47] <ExtraSteve> Your way makes more sense, though
[05:52:53] <Cork> ExtraSteve: ya, submit will be too late
[05:52:55] <goodygum> Cork: mhm, and how to stop the script find() to not looking deeper?
[05:53:02] <Kartagis> taplar: could you give me an example?
[05:53:19] <goodygum> Cork: are there any fancy jQuery libs to handle the JSON?
[05:53:19] <Cork> goodygum: you use find on a json object??
[05:53:25] <taplar> $(fieldSelector).on('change', function(){ $(this).closest('form').prop('action', newValue); });
[05:53:45] <goodygum> Cork: not find() directly, but something in this direction ;)
[05:53:45] <ExtraSteve> Excellent :D
[05:53:47] <ExtraSteve> Thanks!
[05:54:38] <Cork> goodygum: var errors = $.grep(data.Groups.NeedAck, function(obj) { return obj.status == 'error }).length;
[05:54:43] <Cork> opps
[05:54:46] <Cork> goodygum: var errors = $.grep(data.Groups.NeedAck, function(obj) { return obj.status == 'error' }).length;
[05:55:00] <goodygum> Cork: mhm, thx!
[05:55:16] <Cork> not sure how you would ever use .find on json...
[05:55:22] <Cork> so not sure what you originally asked...
[05:56:07] <goodygum> Cork: data as JSON file, amirite?
[05:56:33] <taplar> json would translate into a js object, not a dom
[05:57:26] <Cork> also the web doesn't have files, it has resources
[05:57:36] <Cork> well except for form uploads
[05:57:56] <Cork> (and server side)
[06:11:27] <taplar> mmm, banana
[06:12:24] <taplar> figure i'm a monkey at a keyboard, might as well fit the steriotype
[06:16:35] <ULT> so taplar, cork, I need to use javascript for the preselected options because there are server side no options for?
[06:16:41] <ULT> is that the conclusion? ^^
[06:17:21] <taplar> ULT: you can run your function on page load as an option, or preload your display with the defaults too
[06:17:22] <Cork> ULT: like i said before, an option is to display the page with all the options (so a reader without js can see what options there are and manually filter them out)
[06:17:31] <Cork> ULT: and then you can add the filtering through js
[06:17:43] <Cork> that way you never get a broken interface
[06:18:02] <Cork> (just one with progressively enhanced functionality)
[06:18:55] <momomo> if you create a new script and add async=false to lock up the loading .. it appears as if it is still being performen in async mode
[06:19:17] <momomo> is there a way to enforce async withiut doing a xmlhttprequest?
[06:19:34] <Cork> momomo: you shouldn't use sync ajax
[06:19:45] <Cork> the browsers are moving away from supporting it too
[06:19:57] <momomo> Cork, i know, but i am supplying it as an option
[06:20:05] <Cork> momomo: you shouldn't
[06:20:10] <momomo> it has it's uses
[06:20:12] <Cork> even jquery has depricated it
[06:20:15] <Cork> no it doesn't
[06:20:23] <Cork> it is a really really bad user experience
[06:20:32] <Cork> and you just shouldn't do it
[06:20:40] <Cork> there are better ways to do it now days
[06:20:46] <Cork> (websocket for example)
[06:21:39] <momomo> i am rendering content .. it is displayed ... if for instance the developer requests a resource, it needs to come in in order to be included in the result .. i uses promises for async mode .. both for certain cases you need to wait for the resul
[06:21:40] <momomo> t
[06:22:01] <Cork> momomo: yes, you should wait in async mode
[06:22:08] <Cork> and not lock the users browser...
[06:22:17] <Cork> for unknown amount of time
[06:22:26] <ULT> oke thanks guys. will give it a try.
[06:22:44] <Cork> momomo: well not unknown but between 10ms and 5 minutes
[06:23:05] <momomo> Sorella, ok, i will just forget about supporting it ..
[06:23:12] <momomo> Cork, i mean
[06:23:27] <Cork> momomo: google groups is a perfectly good example why sync ajax calls are a horrible idea
[06:23:39] <Kartagis> taplar: could you give me an example of not doing that and doing my binding in the js?
[06:24:10] <taplar> sure
[06:24:25] <Cork> momomo: sync ajax calls are normally just a lazy way out for developers that don't care to do it correctly
[06:24:38] <Cork> there are solutions for all of the cases depending on sync ajax now days
[06:24:46] <Cork> that doesn't depend on blocking the thread
[06:25:16] <taplar> Kartagis: actually just look here at the example block under the "Callback Function" part http://api.jquery.com/load/
[06:25:23] <Cork> sure it requires that you write the code to work with it, but you can do it
[06:25:50] <momomo> Cork, like i said, normally I use async.. but for certain cases, where the value needs to be passed to a method, you can not suddenly pass a promsie ... where it is normally expected that it is present ... for cases for when you need to load it externally, to pass it to a method .. you need the actual result
[06:26:09] <Cork> momomo: ya, and that is the statement i don't accept, there isn't a case you need it anymore
[06:26:10] <Cork> none
[06:26:14] <taplar> momomo: you'd call the function in the done
[06:26:18] <taplar> or success
[06:26:30] <Cork> the downsides of sync ajax are way to grate to ever accept using sync ajax
[06:26:44] <Cork> you just plainly should never do it, ever
[06:27:18] <momomo> you guys fail to recognize that there are usecases
[06:27:32] <Cork> i do recognize there used to be use cases
[06:27:35] <Cork> but there isn't anymore
[06:27:50] <Cork> they went away when websocket became cross browser
[06:27:51] <taplar> the use case you provided is the need for a variable to call a function.  the response i gave was call the function once you have the variable
[06:28:31] <taplar> event vs procedural logic
[06:28:36] <momomo> for isntance in sync mode ... where are resources are available .. i do not need a promise and my templates do not need to push to an array and get re evaluated later ... in sync mode, I can just append the result onto a string for instance ... but if for instance in sync mode, the user decides to make one request, the sync mode concationation needst o continue working ..
[06:28:52] <momomo> you can not do that if you suddenly reenter async mode
[06:29:09] <Cork> momomo: ya, in sync mode you can just be lazy and leave the user to take the consequences
[06:29:09] <Kartagis> taplar: I thought you said not to do that onClick. this example block doesn't provide a better way
[06:29:23] <Cork> momomo: those are perfectly doable with async mode
[06:29:48] <taplar> Kartagis: you would do your binding inside that callback.  the normal $(selector).on(event, callback) way.
[06:29:49] <Cork> it just requires you to write the code in a way that doesn't require everything to work in sync
[06:30:07] <momomo> Cork, the are doable, but you need to push to an array for that .. and then walk over the array.. which in theory is slower than sync mode concat, where you can just append
[06:30:08] <Cork> (or to be frank, it requires you to write modern js)
[06:30:18] <Cork> momomo: no you don't
[06:30:30] <Cork> promises and $.when solves that
[06:31:13] <Cork> momomo: the one case i saw for sync ajax was on page unload, to make a call before the page closes
[06:31:19] <Cork> but websocket solves that now days
[06:31:32] <momomo> you can not do result.template += 'something'; result.done(function(template) { result.tempalte += template } ); result.template += 'somethingesle'
[06:31:37] <Cork> and everything else works perfectly well in async mode, as long asy ou write it correctly
[06:31:49] <momomo> they will get into the wrong oerder
[06:31:57] <momomo> you can only do that if you push to an array
[06:32:01] <momomo> and to position
[06:32:40] <brk> Hi, is there a way to change the MIME type when using form.submit()?
[06:32:43] <prohobo> okay
[06:32:45] <momomo> however, for my case I am really just trying to support an edge case
[06:32:48] <prohobo> what the hell did i mess up here?
[06:32:57] <momomo> and something that developeres really should be doing
[06:33:00] <Cork> $.when(ajax1, ajax2, ajax3, ajax4).done(function(data1, data2, data3, data4) { result.template += data1; result.template += data2; result.template += data3; result.template += data4 });
[06:33:03] <Cork> momomo: there done
[06:33:26] <Cork> (i think i have the wrong arguments for the done function, but the rest is correct)
[06:33:52] <Cork> momomo: again there are zero use for sync ajax
[06:34:06] <Cork> the only use for it is "i don't want to learn to do it without it"
[06:34:07] <momomo> Cork, in between thos ajaax calls are other strings that needs to be concatinated .. they are done so as they are encountered ... like i said, I already do this quite successfully in async mode
[06:43:58] <Kartagis> taplar: so in index.html I src index.js, and in index.js I do $("#btn....... ?
[06:44:20] <taplar> Kartagis: no, you'd do that in that callback
[06:44:42] <taplar> or alternatively, you could do it with a delegate binding on the element the html is being inserted into, and then you wouldn't have to care when it was added later
[06:46:06] <taplar> have you done delegates or binding in this manner before?
[06:46:32] <brk> Anyone knows how I can change the MIME type? I get this error in Chrome developer console: Resource interpreted as Document but transferred with MIME type application/json when I used form.submit();
[07:21:14] <Tumulte> hello
[07:21:28] <taplar> hola
[07:21:41] <Tumulte> is it possible to read the class of a clicked child when you click a parent
[07:22:13] <Tumulte> actually to get the clicked element
[07:22:22] <taplar> $(this)
[07:22:28] <taplar> or just 'this'
[07:22:40] <Cork> Tumulte: event.target.className
[07:22:58] <Cork> will give you the class of the actually clicked element
[07:23:14] <Cork> (instead of the element with the event handler)
[07:24:35] <Tumulte> mh
[07:24:40] <Tumulte> did not work
[07:28:06] <PCatinean> How does one add a sibling to a existing element?
[07:28:24] <PCatinean> <div>something</div><div>some other div</div>
[07:28:29] <PCatinean> so it's not append
[07:28:34] <taplar> insertBefore or insertAfter are options
[07:28:43] <PCatinean> thank you!
[07:41:19] <PCatinean> hmm that didn't work :(

[07:56:28] <dimi1947> is there an easy way to replace a div with its content...place in its position another div with another content
[07:57:39] <Cork> dimi1947: why replace the div with it's content?
[07:57:45] <Cork> just leave the container and then replace it
[08:01:44] <dimi1947> let me explain...
[08:03:44] <dimi1947> this div has a star in it...the icon favorites...when the user clicks it I just want to be replaced by star of another color...indication that the user has succesfully stored his favorite
[08:04:02] <dimi1947> the star is an image of course
[08:14:21] <estyx> Hi guys, I'm having problems getting $(document).delegate(..) working properly in Safari on iOS 9 (iPad), anyone else been experiencing it?  (jQuery 1.11.3)
[08:15:02] <estyx> it works if i use the parent selector instead of document
[08:15:19] <estyx> element*
[08:25:30] <decx> you shouldnt use document anyway but always a static parent
[08:26:49] <estyx> hm okay, I'll try to redo some of the code and see it helps, thanks :)
[08:27:26] <estyx> if it*
[08:29:34] <duch_kazatel> yaaaaay
[08:45:39] <Dr-007> any of you guys know if its normal behavior for google maps to 'forget' the zoom when you add a marker?
[08:46:42] <midori-rus> Hello there. I am trying to make a class which will be make jquery-ui slider for many inputs. But I have an error, where second slider depends on second. Could u help me to fix it? http://jsfiddle.net/jm5901da/
[08:47:04] <duch_kazatel> Dr-007 you sure those aren't two different operations?
[08:47:47] <duch_kazatel> midori-rus javascript doesn't have classes fwiw.
[08:48:34] <Dr-007> duch_kazatel, yes. i've got one function that loads the google maps. then i've got another function that adds markers
[08:48:46] <Dr-007> they are in seperate javascript files aswell
[08:48:53] <Dr-007> but i believe i should add: , 'bounds': false
[08:48:58] <Dr-007> so im testing that now
[08:49:18] <pyCasso> What is the best approach to updating an object Array based on Dom node changes?
[08:49:26] <duch_kazatel> "object array"?
[08:49:26] <pyCasso> essentially I have a Dom table the displays and object array. I am using jquery sortable() method to resort the table order, but I need to also update the object array as well
[08:49:29] <midori-rus> duch_kazatel: ok, it a class
[08:49:41] <pyCasso> or a way to bind a change event to the object Array
[08:49:43] <duch_kazatel> midori-rus that's... not a class is my point.
[08:49:44] <midori-rus> duch_kazatel: not class, just function. But the question is
[08:49:53] <pyCasso> any ideas?
[08:50:08] <midori-rus> duch_kazatel: is it possible to make it to work with many sliders?
[08:50:08] <duch_kazatel> pyCasso you're looking for some data binding.
[08:50:14] <duch_kazatel> midori-rus make what work?
[08:50:24] <duch_kazatel> Dr-007 you probably need to set the zoom level separately is my point.
[08:50:29] <midori-rus> duch_kazatel: let's see my link.
[08:50:43] <duch_kazatel> i looked - didn't make sense.
[08:50:50] <duch_kazatel> clarify the behavior you want :)
[08:51:02] <midori-rus> duch_kazatel: when u change first range the second changes too
[08:51:05] <pyCasso> duch_kazatel: sort a. When a user resorts a table I need the table order to update the object Array
[08:51:16] <duch_kazatel> pyCasso you mean the array ;)
[08:51:25] <pyCasso> right
[08:51:29] <pyCasso> array
[08:51:34] <duch_kazatel> event listener
[08:52:11] <duch_kazatel> basically, your listeners should update the array, then render the array back out.
[08:52:26] <duch_kazatel> don't update the document and them modify the array - just modify the array and then render back out.
[08:53:22] <pyCasso> hmm?? the array order is based on user action
[08:53:57] <duch_kazatel> are they dragging items around
[08:53:58] <duch_kazatel> ?
[08:54:03] <duch_kazatel> or are the changing a sort order?
[08:54:31] <pyCasso> User will be dragging items above or below other items.
[08:54:41] <pyCasso> im working on a fiddle
[08:54:51] <duch_kazatel> okay, that's a little different.
[08:55:06] <duch_kazatel> what's this array going to be used for later?
[08:55:16] <duch_kazatel> like, could you instead just grab all the data before a form submit?
[08:58:52] <Dr-007> duch_kazatel, yeah i though that too. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11804365/jquery-ui-map-set-zoom-level
[08:59:04] <Dr-007> i had to put in a setTimeout for settings the marker
[08:59:09] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[08:59:18] <Dr-007> *placing
[08:59:30] <Dr-007> with bounds: false
[08:59:36] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you need to use a load callback.
[08:59:36] <Dr-007> no need to rezoom
[08:59:51] <Dr-007> nah
[08:59:58] <Dr-007> its because i've got 2 documents
[09:00:02] <duch_kazatel> wut
[09:00:11] <Dr-007> 1 custom JS for all google maps functions
[09:00:23] <Dr-007> and 1 JS thats related to the page i'm currently viewing
[09:00:31] <duch_kazatel> you still want a load callback.
[09:00:38] <duch_kazatel> timeouts lead to race conditions,'
[09:01:00] <Dr-007> i dont think the plugin supports those load callbacks
[09:01:10] <Dr-007> or do you have a suggestion
[09:01:14] <duch_kazatel> the google maps plugin?
[09:01:28] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/832692/how-can-i-check-whether-google-maps-is-fully-loaded

[09:02:54] <HoNgOuRu> how is a text changed detected inside a div ?
[09:03:35] <pyCasso> $('div').html('my new text')
[09:03:54] <Dr-007> duch_kazatel, ah: $('#map_canvas').gmap({ 'callback': function () {  its inthere
[09:03:58] <Dr-007> ill do that then. thanks
[09:04:11] <Dr-007> duch_kazatel, ah: $('#map_canvas').gmap({ 'callback': function () {  its inthere
[09:04:13] <Dr-007> ill do that then. thanks
[09:04:16] <HoNgOuRu> pyCasso, I want to do something when the text changes, not change it manually
[09:06:52] <amanwithanicknam> HoNgOuRu: when you change text of your DIV fire your event !
[09:07:40] <HoNgOuRu> I dont change the text, it is done automatically
[09:07:54] <Dr-007> automatically when what happends?
[09:07:55] <HoNgOuRu> I cant get the event
[09:07:58] <Dr-007> when a radio changes?
[09:08:20] <HoNgOuRu> the youtube page video title after a video changes it changes, I want to get that change
[09:09:13] <duch_kazatel> HoNgOuRu you need to go to a chrome extension channel or something.
[09:09:28] <HoNgOuRu> mmm
[09:09:58] <Dr-007> you can monitor the youtube player state
[09:10:04] <HoNgOuRu> It should be straight forward... I can do a hover event and change the event, I want just to pop up an alert when the text changes
[09:10:04] <Dr-007> when its loading
[09:10:07] <Dr-007> or done playing
[09:10:28] <duch_kazatel> HoNgOuRu dom mutation observers, but that's not going to work as well as you want.
[09:10:37] <duch_kazatel> the window should be firing a popstate event.
[09:11:01] <HoNgOuRu> I tried to capture the popstate event, but didn't work
[09:11:08] <duch_kazatel> if the URL is updating without reloading the page, that's exactly what's happening.
[09:11:09] <duch_kazatel> sooo...
[09:11:39] <HoNgOuRu> duch_kazatel, well, the url changes and the page doesnt reload... so probably that is
[09:12:09] <HoNgOuRu> I believe its something related to delegates
[09:12:13] <HoNgOuRu> and events
[09:12:15] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[09:12:19] <duch_kazatel> not with popstates.
[09:13:19] <amanwithanicknam> HoNgOuRu: like this??? https://jsfiddle.net/myx4a2ew/
[09:13:20] <ULT> Hi when you select the next (immediately preceding) sibbling, does it have added value to name the element like .next('label') or is only .next() enough?
[09:13:40] <duch_kazatel> ULT check the docs.
[09:14:13] <ULT> optionally filtered by a selector.
[09:14:22] <duch_kazatel> right.
[09:14:31] <Dr-007> duch_kazatel, do you've got an idea how to "connect" the google maps callback to trigger a "dynamic" function? since i've got the javascript documents seperated from eachother
[09:14:48] <Dr-007> i need to call a function from doc 1 in doc 2
[09:14:58] <Dr-007> but doc 1 could also be calling doc 3
[09:15:02] <duch_kazatel> you keep talking about "doc 1" and "doc 2" - clarify.
[09:15:07] <ULT> so uhm, how do I need to interpret that?
[09:15:08] <duch_kazatel> is this a page with an iframe?
[09:15:25] <ULT> is it better to add the elementname or not?
[09:15:38] <ULT> or it doesnt matter?
[09:15:59] <Dr-007> doc1: all javascript functions regarding to google maps. doc2: a client page with a specific client javascript document. in this document i'm calling the "add makers" function thats is in doc 1
[09:16:18] <duch_kazatel> ULT doesn't really matter.
[09:16:23] <ULT> oke thanks.
[09:16:29] <duch_kazatel> i prefer using .closest() and .find() for that sort of stuff.
[09:16:33] <Dr-007> doc 3: another page a page with the location of someone's router. this page also has its own javascript document. this javascript is also calling the add markers function
[09:17:11] <ULT> duch_kazatel, it is almost working now: http://jsfiddle.net/ultimatia/atuqpw1p/1/
[09:17:13] <duch_kazatel> Dr-007 so the two pages need to talk to one another?
[09:17:18] <Dr-007> doc 4: another page. this one is not calling the add markers function
[09:17:19] <duch_kazatel> that needs to go through your server.
[09:17:21] <ULT> But I have used a each loop
[09:17:31] <ULT> for displaying the option values onload.
[09:17:37] <Dr-007> duch_kazatel, yeah. they're talking to eachother
[09:18:00] <Dr-007> duch_kazatel, i suppose in the google maps callback function i could try to read a variable that holds the function it should call
[09:18:18] <duch_kazatel> Dr-007 that's... hacky.  does the function change based on the page?
[09:18:26] <Dr-007> but that means i should predefine the function google maps should call after its done loading. which is not cool
[09:18:41] <Dr-007> yeah the function changes based on the page
[09:18:59] <duch_kazatel> then use a different js file per page.
[09:19:10] <Dr-007> i am doing that
[09:19:18] <duch_kazatel> then i'm way lost haha
[09:19:39] <Dr-007> only the google maps javascript is always the same in all pages
[09:19:48] <Dr-007> since the functions are all re-usable
[09:19:58] <Dr-007> never mind
[09:20:01] <Dr-007> ill figure it out
[09:24:20] <HoNgOuRu> amanwithanicknam, thanks, it works only the first time, but only after the manual change (got to change 'div' for my #id )  not after a video change that changes the same div as the div changed manually
[09:26:04] <duch_kazatel> HoNgOuRu right.
[09:26:05] <duch_kazatel> again.
[09:26:09] <duch_kazatel> you need to check the popstate.
[09:26:30] <HoNgOuRu> ok
[09:26:39] <HoNgOuRu> duch_kazatel, how do I get the popstate ?
[09:26:47] <duch_kazatel> !g javascrpt window popstate
[09:26:48] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Window.onpopstate - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onpopstate
[09:26:54] <duch_kazatel> ^ there you go.
[09:27:04] <HoNgOuRu> thanks
[09:27:12] <HoNgOuRu> I thought it was only for firefox
[09:27:16] <HoNgOuRu> :(
[09:27:29] <duch_kazatel> MDN is a general javascript reference
[09:27:42] <HoNgOuRu> didnt know that
[09:31:12] <HoNgOuRu> I coppied line 1 2 3 inside the document ready clause... but nothing happens after a change
[09:32:47] <duch_kazatel> you really need to read the chronme docs.
[09:32:56] <duch_kazatel> *chrome extension docs.
[09:33:01] <HoNgOuRu> I did
[09:33:10] <HoNgOuRu> this should work

[09:38:16] <duch_kazatel> what have you tried?
[09:39:41] <duch_kazatel> also, you have a type mismatch there.
[09:42:20] <abailarri> duch_kazatel, I not tried anything because I don't know for what way go
[09:42:31] <abailarri> I don't know where to start
[09:42:33] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn array filter
[09:42:34] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Array.prototype.filter() - JavaScript | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
[09:42:36] <duch_kazatel> :)
[09:43:11] <decx> loop through it and check if el.id has an index in your directives
[09:43:57] <duch_kazatel> no need to loop http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7nh4ouyx/2/
[09:44:15] <decx> filter is a loop
[09:44:52] <duch_kazatel> errr...
[09:45:04] <duch_kazatel> it might implicitly enumerate under the hood.
[09:45:12] <decx> and yeah, gotta make those numbers numbers in the array
[09:45:19] <decx> or parseInt or whatever
[09:45:33] <duch_kazatel> yeah
[09:46:00] <Audlex> what am I doing wrong here? I want to select the first instance of this classes immediate sibling
[09:46:11] <Audlex> $('.scroll-section').first().next().data('time');
[09:46:42] <decx> looks right to me
[09:47:17] <duch_kazatel> yeah, something tells me your markup might be busted.
[09:47:53] <Audlex> $('.scroll-section').first().data('time'); works fine
[09:48:05] <decx> console.log all the things
[09:48:20] <duch_kazatel> you might not have a proper understanding of sibling ;)
[09:49:00] <Audlex> its about 10 .scroll-section in a row
[09:49:24] <Audlex> I will play around with console.log more
[09:49:38] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle otherwise.
[09:50:36] <Audlex> will do, if it looks right I would have messed it up somewhere
[09:50:42] <Audlex> cheers for the help
[09:52:08] <abailarri> duch_kazatel, I tried with this http://jsfiddle.net/7nh4ouyx/6/, but I not get results. Can you guide me please?
[09:52:41] <duch_kazatel> abailarri if(elemento.id == directives)  doesn't make sense.
[09:52:45] <duch_kazatel> you want indexOf()
[09:53:23] <duch_kazatel> and you return true or false.
[09:53:25] <duch_kazatel> not the element.
[09:53:27] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7nh4ouyx/2/
[09:55:13] <amanwithanicknam> abailarri: http://jsfiddle.net/7nh4ouyx/7/ check this!
[09:55:48] <duch_kazatel> missing the second arg to parseInt there.
[09:56:39] <duch_kazatel> and there's no need to use $.grep() here.
[09:57:21] <amanwithanicknam> why?
[09:57:25] <decx> i love to use an inverted jquery method when there's a easier to use native one !
[09:57:43] <duch_kazatel> because javascript has a native filter()
[09:58:23] <Uhkis> -1 not enough jquery
[09:59:02] <amanwithanicknam> ok
[10:36:28] <danpsy> How could I animate the opacity for an element based on the window's scrollTop position? I'm trying with this: jQuery(window).scroll(function (event) { jQuery('div#area').animate({opacity:(jQuery(this).scrollTop() >= 1 ? 0.15 : 1.0)}, 250); });
[10:36:50] <duch_kazatel> yeesh
[10:37:51] <danpsy> It works well once the page is scrolling downwards, but not once it has returned to the top
[10:39:57] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/go6r8dg8/
[10:40:01] <duch_kazatel> should work fine.
[10:40:19] <duch_kazatel> fwiw - you should really select those elements and store them in vars outside of the scroll handler.
[10:43:27] <danpsy> Take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/go6r8dg8/1/ - Does it fade back in for you once you've come back to the top?
[10:44:28] <duch_kazatel> oh, i see the issue.
[10:44:51] <duch_kazatel> animation queue
[10:44:59] <duch_kazatel> debounce that sucker.
[10:46:22] <duch_kazatel> the issue is for every time the scroll even fires (which can be dozens of times a second), another call is made to animate.
[10:52:07] <Qiller> hi friends, when i click, this alert repeat two more times. anyone can help me? http://pastebin.com/UH9mrTmc
[10:52:28] <duch_kazatel> what version of jquery are you using?
[10:52:49] <duch_kazatel> Qiller
[10:53:15] <Qiller> hi duch_kazatel
[10:53:32] <Qiller> latest version
[10:53:34] <duch_kazatel> also, do you have a .podcast element inside a .podcast element?
[10:53:43] <duch_kazatel> and use .on(), not .bind()
[10:53:50] <Qiller> no, i'm using jQuery v1.8.2 jquery.com
[10:53:59] <duch_kazatel> yeah, use .on(), not .bind()
[10:54:13] <Qiller> try, wait
[10:54:17] <duch_kazatel> that won't fix it.
[10:54:23] <duch_kazatel> but that's a good change to make.
[10:54:53] <duch_kazatel> you're calling hide on two elements, btw.
[10:55:01] <duch_kazatel> i wonder if that's why that alert is firing twice.
[10:55:40] <Qiller> cant i call hide on two elem?
[10:55:52] <duch_kazatel> you can, but that means all of that logic will fire for both.
[10:55:54] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: .on( "click", "tr", function() { dont work =\
[10:56:13] <duch_kazatel> you don't have to pass that second param if you're directly binding.
[10:57:05] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: i understand, sry my english is bad.
[10:57:11] <duch_kazatel> it's fine.
[10:57:21] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: can you edit or comment on my pastebin code?
[10:57:34] <duch_kazatel> there's... nothing to edit or comment.
[10:57:56] <duch_kazatel> i already explained what the problem is.
[10:58:13] <duch_kazatel> woops
[10:59:38] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: and two alerts, can you help me?
[10:59:43] <duch_kazatel> ...
[10:59:49] <duch_kazatel> i'm not sure what you want me to do.
[10:59:54] <duch_kazatel> i already explained what's causing the problem.
[11:01:12] <Qiller> you're calling hide on two elements, btw.
[11:01:18] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[11:01:52] <Qiller> omg, working now
[11:02:06] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: but i need hide two or more elements =( haha
[11:02:28] <duch_kazatel> then use deferreds.
[11:03:27] <Qiller> learning about deferreds tank
[11:05:51] <duch_kazatel> wait.  why is that code even in that callback?
[11:06:10] <duch_kazatel> ah it's aniamted.
[11:06:12] <duch_kazatel> *animated
[11:08:04] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/txx20h4j/

[11:14:04] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: first time working with Deffered. thanks
[11:29:27] <Kartagis> taplar: follow-up: I meant something like $("#apply-page-button").on("click", function() { $("#contentHolder.index").load("apply.html #contentHolder.apply"; })
[12:33:47] <SpecialTechnique> Is there a way to create a mouseover event listener for youtube videos?
[12:34:22] <SpecialTechnique> I understand you can't do a click event cause of cross origin, but would a mouseover work?
[12:40:42] <NoiseEee> SpecialTechnique: javascript is javascript
[12:40:59] <NoiseEee> SpecialTechnique: so, no.
[12:42:05] <arc_> what do you mean by that
[12:45:50] <SpecialTechnique> @noiseEee yea what do you mean by that? : P
[12:46:58] <NoiseEee> well cross-origin restrictions apply to everything javascript
[12:47:13] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy
[12:48:37] <SpecialTechnique> Oh I know that, but I was just wondering if a mouse hover event would work since it can't be click. Like instead of targeting the actual iframe, I target the div it's wrapped in?
[12:48:58] <NoiseEee> you can certainly monitor the entire iframe for hovering
[12:49:45] <NoiseEee> but not the contents within it afaik
[12:50:13] <SpecialTechnique> Yea understandable
[12:51:26] <arc_> easiest way to answer the question is to try it
[13:05:36] <zumba_addict> working daily on ajax calls and timeouts due to network issues, I kinda became better at understanding on how to set timeout appropriately. Previously, we didn't have any timeouts. Some ajax calls were taking like 3 mins before it gets canceled. I've started setting it to 60 and now I'm down to 20 seconds. I think the user experience is so much better. Do you guys agree with me on this?
[13:07:45] <plamb> where would you put the .slideDown/.slideUp in this to get the desired effect?
[13:07:46] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/nijinvinodan/WtdEh/
[13:37:03] <molossus> is there a way i can write a jquery statement that gets all ids with    #custom_carousel ?   i would like to be able to get #custom_carousel2,  #custom_carousel3, #custom_carousel4 , etc
[13:38:01] <Woet> molossus: use a class?
[13:38:17] <duch_kazatel> use a class instead for that.
[13:38:21] <duch_kazatel> because that's what you want.
[13:38:58] <molossus> i tried that it doesnt work with what i want to do, its a bootstrap modal box
[13:39:07] <duch_kazatel> you use both.
[13:39:10] <duch_kazatel> a class and the custom IDs.
[13:39:36] <duch_kazatel> or use the class and data attributes and then programmatically trigger the modal, instead of using the baked in methods.
[13:39:53] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you're using a partial attribute selector and those are slow and not really what you want.
[13:41:28] <molossus> the problem is that i have jQuery('#custom_carousel .controls li.active').removeClass('active');
[13:42:04] <molossus> and for the other dozen carousels i have #custom_carousel2 , and so on
[13:42:30] <duch_kazatel> right, so give them all a shared class and target that class instead.
[13:44:14] <molossus> the modal boxes do not work if i do that  this is code i have     http://pastebin.com/13NiBfGk
[13:44:29] <duch_kazatel> right.
[13:44:36] <duch_kazatel> i feel like you're conflating something.
[13:45:05] <molossus> the modal boxes conflict if they share the same class, thats why i have it with  IDs
[13:45:13] <molossus> and they wont open at all
[13:45:14] <duch_kazatel> and then add a class as well.
[13:45:23] <duch_kazatel> alternatively, manually wire everything yourself.
[13:45:34] <duch_kazatel> so you use your IDs and a class.
[13:46:11] <molossus> thats what  i didnt want to do, i looked at regex too but  couldnt get it working
[13:46:20] <duch_kazatel> that's actually really what you want.
[13:46:27] <duch_kazatel> partial attribute selectors are slow.
[13:46:37] <duch_kazatel> you're also trying to rewrite the concept of classes at that point.
[13:48:43] <molossus> so basically repeating the same code 12 times if i have 12 modal boxes
[13:48:52] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle.
[13:48:57] <duch_kazatel> because you're conflating something.
[13:49:16] <duch_kazatel> you should only need the code once.
[13:50:13] <duch_kazatel> wait is this a carousel in a modal?
[13:50:18] <molossus> each modal box is called from a button :  <li data-target="#custom_carousel2"  >  that will call the modal box #custom_carousel2,  but i have 12 of these, each data-target needs a unique ID
[13:50:22] <molossus> yes a carousel in a modal
[13:50:25] <molossus> and its in wordpress
[13:50:32] <duch_kazatel> wordpress is irrelevant fwiw.
[13:50:34] <molossus> but that shouldnt matter
[13:50:37] <duch_kazatel> and yeah, make a quick fiddle :)
[13:50:48] <duch_kazatel> basically, you need to manually wire all this up.
[13:53:30] <molossus> i got the html and js from this and converted to WP  http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/tabbed-slider-carousel-inspired-by-sevenxde  ,  i took that and put it into bootstrap modals
[13:53:47] <duch_kazatel> yeah literally none of this so far requires IDs.
[13:53:55] <duch_kazatel> i was going to try to help you fix your code but okay.
[13:54:33] <molossus> i can post in paste bin the WP code that includes the modal and the carousels
[13:54:59] <duch_kazatel> that's not really helpful.
[13:56:29] <molossus> cant put it into a fiddle, i will have to take out all non WP code  and convert it into pure html
[13:56:39] <duch_kazatel> err
[13:56:39] <duch_kazatel> lol
[13:57:08] <duch_kazatel> so does each modal have a different carousel in it?
[13:57:22] <molossus> yes,  i have several modals
[13:58:00] <duch_kazatel> and each one is a different carousel?  because you can just add a class that all the modals or whatever share and call it a day.
[13:58:07] <duch_kazatel> none of your code requires IDs.
[13:58:12] <molossus> nope
[13:58:15] <molossus> that does not work
[13:58:25] <duch_kazatel> you'd have to change  jQuery('#custom_carousel .controls li.active').removeClass('active'); obviouisly.
[13:58:31] <duch_kazatel> and make everything relative to $(this)
[13:58:38] <duch_kazatel> but that'll work.
[13:58:50] <molossus> even if you have 2 modals and both share same class none will be displayed
[13:59:06] <duch_kazatel> you leave the IDS as well as have the calss.
[13:59:15] <duch_kazatel> $(this).find('.controls li.active').removeClass('active');
[13:59:17] <duch_kazatel> etc
[14:02:12] <zumba_addict> what's the best thing to do if our ajax got canceled due to timeout being reached?
[14:02:26] <duch_kazatel> trigger the fail condition and go from there.
[14:02:35] <duch_kazatel> depends on the interface, criticality, etc.
[14:02:47] <zumba_addict> our f*c*ng jsonp has to go and be burried
[14:03:10] <duch_kazatel> lol why censor the word if we know exactly what word you're using?
[14:03:15] <duch_kazatel> never made sense to me.
[14:03:15] <zumba_addict> :D
[14:03:29] <zumba_addict> it's a 2% more polite, hahaha
[14:08:47] <zumba_addict> omg, i hope my understanding right
[14:08:59] <zumba_addict> can we really do promise on jsonp? it's because i got an error
[14:09:13] <duch_kazatel> are you using $.ajax() ?
[14:09:49] <zumba_addict> we are using backbone which calls $.ajax()
[14:09:59] <zumba_addict> yes, i am not using getJSONP
[14:10:20] <zumba_addict> and the issue happens in safari but not in chrome
[14:10:30] <zumba_addict> not often though
[14:13:48] <zumba_addict> duch_kazatel: does promise work in jsonp?
[14:16:35] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ - Returns: jqXHR
[14:16:54] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR -> "The jqXHR objects returned by $.ajax() as of jQuery 1.5 implement the Promise interface[...]"

[14:30:39] <tommy_s> hey, I have few pictures that show up with a jquery script I wrote (at default they are 'hidden'), things is, when I try to show them there is a second where they are loading and just show a white screen. Is there a way to load even the hidden pictures before exceuting the script?
[14:38:06] <bango2> tommy_s load the pics at dom load time, then hide them. theyll stay in ram ready to be set visible
[14:39:09] <tommy_s> but what if the user try to activate the script meanwhile they load? don't I need some kind of a callback to notify me the images has been loaded?
[14:42:21] <tommy_s> bango2 but what if the user try to activate the script while they load? doesn't I need some kind of a callback to notify me the images has been loaded?
[14:42:33] <duch_kazatel> tommy_s we saw it the first time ;)
[14:42:46] <bango2> js should only happen on document.ready dommy_s
[14:42:58] <tommy_s> right, thanks!
[14:43:00] <duch_kazatel> tommy_s you can't bind a .load()
[14:43:03] <tommy_s> o hey dutch :D
[14:43:06] <duch_kazatel> *duch
[14:43:11] <tommy_s> duch
[14:43:15] <duch_kazatel> err, you CAN bind a load.
[14:43:21] <duch_kazatel> but it's kind of awkward with images.
[14:46:47] <tommy_s> huh
[14:47:53] <duch_kazatel> so there's a callback for when images load, but it's hard to work with.
[14:48:42] <tommy_s> bango2, that doesn't seems to work for some reason... the images are background of a hidden LI tag which are defined in "display: none" css attribute, I tried a script which suppose to show and then hide them but that doesn't do the trick
[14:49:07] <bango2> can you give me a fiddle tommy_s?
[14:49:37] <bango2> are you using img src or background url?
[14:50:09] <tommy_s> yeah, one moment
[14:50:16] <tommy_s> background url
[14:50:23] <tommy_s> background-image: url()
[14:51:12] <tommy_s> https://jsfiddle.net/b50tL1dd/
[14:51:55] <tommy_s> btw I want to change the background image url setting to the jquery instead of the html
[14:52:58] <duch_kazatel> can't get what you want on background images fwiw.
[14:53:28] <tommy_s> huh?
[14:53:50] <duch_kazatel> last i checked you can't detect when a background image has loaded.
[14:53:51] <tommy_s> nothing, just some side note that Im just doing minor changes in the code
[14:53:59] <bango2> tommy check out the second answer with 121 upvotes http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1373142/preloading-css-images
[14:54:25] <duch_kazatel> just use a sprite here imo
[14:54:45] <bango2> then hes gotta mess with the math and positioning
[14:55:13] <duch_kazatel> there are systems out there that handle all of that for you.
[14:55:22] <bango2> whatll it cost to not use sprites? 1ms? less?
[14:55:49] <duch_kazatel> depends on his server, client bandwidth, how small the images are, etc.
[14:56:05] <tommy_s> I could have use a sprite from the begining it would have made my slide much easier
[14:56:08] <tommy_s> slider*
[14:56:18] <duch_kazatel> wait is this a carousel?
[14:56:24] <tommy_s> yeah :)
[14:56:28] <duch_kazatel> :(
[14:56:31] <tommy_s> lol
[14:56:34] <tommy_s> thats the same one
[14:56:39] <duch_kazatel> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[14:56:52] <tommy_s> already saw it mate :)
[14:57:02] <duch_kazatel> it's a great point.
[14:57:49] <bango2> well im not here to tell you what not to use, but there are some great jquery carousel libraries already out there
[14:58:12] <tommy_s> yeah I know, its just a learning expirience as far as I can see it
[14:58:19] <duch_kazatel> oh this thing again.
[14:58:31] <bango2> ok so reinvent the wheel to get better at jquery sort of thing
[14:58:47] <tommy_s> bango2, btw - whats the body:after does? I thought after is for adding content at the ending of a tag
[14:59:00] <duch_kazatel> :after is a pseudoelement
[14:59:01] <tommy_s> but for a body? and changing its display to none?
[14:59:07] <duch_kazatel> !g :after css
[14:59:07] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: CSS ::after Selector - W3Schools â†’ http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_after.asp
[14:59:11] <bango2> yes :before and :after are css attributes that add styling or content to the beginning or end of an element
[14:59:12] <tommy_s> does it means that after the body is over, add images and hide them?
[14:59:13] <duch_kazatel> ewwww w3schools
[14:59:27] <duch_kazatel> bango that's not accurate.
[14:59:34] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/%3A%3Aafter
[15:00:25] <duch_kazatel> psuedo elements are weird.
[15:00:29] <bango2> whats not accurate about it duch
[15:01:02] <duch_kazatel> they target a "virtual" last or "virtual" first child element
[15:01:06] <duch_kazatel> not the element itself.
[15:01:42] <bango2> ok. well my time here is up
[15:01:48] <bango2> have fun guys
[15:01:50] <tommy_s> thats bango2!
[15:01:53] <tommy_s> thanjks*
[15:01:55] <tommy_s> thanks :|
[15:01:57] <bango2> np later
[15:02:13] <tommy_s> just you and me now duch
[15:02:16] <tommy_s> just.. you and me
[15:02:38] <duch_kazatel> and 670+ other people.
[15:02:55] <tommy_s> 671
[15:03:02] <duch_kazatel> 677 actually ;)
[15:03:08] <tommy_s> dammit :|
[15:13:26] <tommy_s> hey, duch, any idea why when adding the code directly to the css file the images are prealoading as needed
[15:13:35] <rhizome> hi all. i am doing something like $('h2').wrap(<div></div>) and would like to go back an append something inside of the div, but if i just add an .append to that line it inserts within the h2.
[15:13:42] <duch_kazatel> tommy_s huh?
[15:13:43] <tommy_s> but when writing it in jquery (outside of the "ready") it doesn't? $('body:after').css({'display': 'none', 'content': 'url(red.jpg) url(green.jpg) url(blue.jpg) url(yellow.jpg)'});
[15:13:44] <duch_kazatel> like, why does it work?
[15:13:55] <duch_kazatel> dunno.
[15:14:03] <duch_kazatel> oh i know.
[15:14:10] <tommy_s> no, I understand why it worked, but not why it doesnt in jquery
[15:14:11] <duch_kazatel> psuedo elements and jquery don't mix.
[15:14:18] <rhizome> i could have swore there was some kind of rewind method that would let me go back to the h2 and work on the div, but i can't remember or find it
[15:14:19] <duch_kazatel> $('body:after') isn't a thing in jquery
[15:14:28] <tommy_s> oh :|
[15:14:34] <tommy_s> so is there some walkaround?
[15:14:48] <tommy_s> maybe adding it to some random element in the page?
[15:14:51] <duch_kazatel> just use the css?
[15:15:05] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you're going to have to offset something, but not all browsers will play well with that.
[15:15:13] <duch_kazatel> rhizome you can .find()
[15:15:16] <tommy_s> but I want the images to be more dynamic :/ means I want them all in one place
[15:15:23] <duch_kazatel> rhizome but method chaining is kind of overrated sometimes.
[15:15:35] <duch_kazatel> tommy_s huh? you're overcomplicating something.
[15:15:48] <tommy_s> maybe, but making them easier
[15:15:53] <tommy_s> in the future
[15:15:53] <duch_kazatel> uh
[15:15:55] <duch_kazatel> not at all.
[15:16:14] <rhizome> duch_kazatel: just go linear/imperative?
[15:16:25] <duch_kazatel> rhizome basically.
[15:16:33] <rhizome> cool, thanks on both counts!
[15:16:37] <duch_kazatel> tommy_s are you creating these elements with jquery in the first place?
[15:17:03] <tommy_s> in the future maybe
[15:17:06] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[15:17:09] <tommy_s> right now - no, in the html
[15:17:24] <duch_kazatel> always use markup.  why are they display: none; right now?
[15:17:36] <duch_kazatel> you just need a div with overflow: none; on it.
[15:18:39] <duch_kazatel> like, there's a parent div that's set to say 250px width and overflow: none;, then a set of child divs that you adjust the margin-left on as necessary.
[15:18:50] <tommy_s> I though about making all of the divs not hidden all times, but them I though that because the DOM doesn't mess with the display:none items maybe it will be 'ligther' to leave all of the unshown elements hidden until they need to be shown
[15:19:01] <tommy_s> thought*
[15:19:03] <duch_kazatel> uh
[15:19:04] <duch_kazatel> no.
[15:19:09] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make sense :)
[15:19:15] <duch_kazatel> the browser will still work with them.,
[15:19:35] <tommy_s> when looking inside other sites that built carousel, I also saw that the unshown items where hidden as well
[15:19:38] <duch_kazatel> there are some very specific cases where you'd want to use display: none; to reduce repaints/reflows/etc, but this is not one of the,.
[15:19:40] <duch_kazatel> *the,
[15:19:43] <tommy_s> were*
[15:19:43] <duch_kazatel> **them
[15:20:38] <duch_kazatel> one big lesson is "don't worry about performance until it becomes a problem"
[15:21:11] <duch_kazatel> with html/css/js, focus on readability and practicality of code first.
[15:21:29] <tommy_s> right, thanks
[15:21:31] <`ULT> duch_kazatel: how should you write this better/ shorter? var optionvalue = $(this).parent().next().find('img').prop('alt');
[15:21:46] <duch_kazatel> i'd have to see your html.
[15:21:55] <tommy_s> but how can u know if theres a preformance problem if you can only see it from your own computer?
[15:21:56] <duch_kazatel> and know what you're actually trying to do.
[15:22:07] <`ULT> good point haha
[15:22:10] <`ULT> you are not a magican
[15:22:12] <`ULT> http://jsfiddle.net/ultimatia/atuqpw1p/2/
[15:22:17] <duch_kazatel> tommy_s in the case of your site, you won't have a performance problem.
[15:22:20] <duch_kazatel> you're not doing anythjing complex.
[15:22:34] <tommy_s> so why not preworry? :)
[15:22:42] <`ULT> line 7
[15:22:44] <duch_kazatel> because it's not that important.
[15:22:50] <duch_kazatel> until it is important.
[15:23:12] <duch_kazatel> `ULT woah.  need some cleanup here.
[15:23:22] <`ULT> :$
[15:23:37] <duch_kazatel> notice how you're repeating $(this)?>
[15:24:06] <`ULT> yes, i use it alot.
[15:24:24] <`ULT> you should make a variable of it?
[15:24:26] <`ULT> or use it less.
[15:24:32] <duch_kazatel> make a var
[15:24:36] <duch_kazatel> var $this = $(this);
[15:24:53] <`ULT> is that better performance?
[15:25:09] <duch_kazatel> in some extreme cases, yes, but you won't notice it here.
[15:25:23] <`ULT> but why should i make a var from it than? :$
[15:25:33] <duch_kazatel> readability.
[15:25:36] <`ULT> I know that you do that alot. for readability?
[15:25:38] <`ULT> oke.
[15:25:38] <duch_kazatel> $(this0 is redundant.
[15:25:48] <duch_kazatel> err, $(this) - do it once.
[15:25:50] <duch_kazatel> good habit to get into.
[15:26:02] <duch_kazatel> and you want the image related to the input?
[15:26:03] <`ULT> oke, will do that.
[15:26:19] <`ULT> what do you mean?
[15:26:25] <`ULT> i need the rel from the image
[15:26:28] <duch_kazatel> right.
[15:26:29] <`ULT> for displaying the tilte
[15:26:34] <duch_kazatel> that's what you're trying to find?
[15:26:37] <`ULT> yes indeed.
[15:26:49] <duch_kazatel> so it's MUCH smarter to use .closest() and .find()
[15:26:54] <`ULT> you can check the html class imageradio
[15:26:58] <duch_kazatel> also - get rid of those onclick and onchange in your html
[15:27:03] <duch_kazatel> don't use those.
[15:27:29] <`ULT> right. that is for another function in the opencart source.
[15:27:36] <duch_kazatel> ugh okay.
[15:27:38] <`ULT> Will trie to remove it/ change it.
[15:27:42] <`ULT> try
[15:27:44] <duch_kazatel> nah then ignore it.
[15:27:51] <duch_kazatel> if that's generated by their setup.
[15:27:57] <`ULT> yes.
[15:28:09] <`ULT> the html is generated.
[15:28:35] <`ULT> I need to study .closest
[15:28:42] <`ULT> you recommand that often.
[15:29:06] <duch_kazatel> it's like find but in the opposite direction.
[15:29:22] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/atuqpw1p/3/ like this.
[15:29:46] <duch_kazatel> the issue with your other way of doing it (with .next() and stuff) is that you're assuming your html will always be laid out a particular way.
[15:30:02] <duch_kazatel> .closest() and .find() is much more flexible in terms of how you move things around.
[15:30:52] <`ULT> that is important. thx!
[15:31:05] <`ULT> and it is quicker writing I see.
[15:31:14] <duch_kazatel> a bit, yeah.
[15:31:38] <duch_kazatel> oftentimes i grab my "parent" element and then do .find() from there to get whatever data i need from the document.
[15:32:20] <`ULT> :)
[15:32:28] <duch_kazatel> `ULT you should check out learn.jquery.com
[15:32:31] <duch_kazatel> and fixingthesejquery.com
[15:33:18] <`ULT> thank you duch_kazatel, I have alot work to do on jquery/ javascript etcetera.
[15:33:28] <`ULT> every good source is good :)
[15:35:29] <`ULT> do you know why your code isn`t working btw?
[15:35:35] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:35:58] <`ULT> what you give me :p
[15:36:10] <`ULT> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/atuqpw1p/3/
[15:36:24] <duch_kazatel> fixingthesejquery.com will give you the tools to help you troubleshoot ;)
[15:36:52] <`ULT> okido hahaa, tommorow another day for it. Than I wil debug the code ^^
[15:36:58] <duch_kazatel> pretty easi to see fwiw.
[15:37:00] <`ULT> need to sleep. Thanks and nn!
[15:37:06] <duch_kazatel> kay
[15:37:07] <duch_kazatel> enjoy.
[15:37:16] <`ULT> thanks!
[15:39:04] <das3in> Can someone point me in the right direction of resources to look for? I'm plotting locations (dots) on canvas, but each of them should have a timestamp. I'd like to have a slider at the bottom of the canvas (similar to a movie) and only plot locations based on the timestamp relative to the slider
[15:39:36] <das3in> I've already plotted the data points. and adding a timestamp to the json isn't an issue. Is the slider/plotting over time that i'm not sure about
[15:43:20] <taplar> \clear
[15:44:01] <johnnyfive> Is "{{$}}" a special symbol in jQ?
[15:44:09] <johnnyfive> Er, have a special meaning, rather
[15:44:18] <duch_kazatel> {{$}} smacks of handlebars or something else.
[15:44:35] <johnnyfive> k ty
[15:55:24] <Crucial|2> das3in which step of that process are you on atm? do you have the slider thing already?
[15:58:46] <das3in> No I don't I just have a collection of objects {x, y, timestamp} and a draw function to draw them onto the canvas
[16:01:58] <das3in> I think I'm going to combine http://ghusse.github.io/jQRangeSlider/ and http://ghusse.github.io/jQRangeSlider/ - I'll just try to match the timestamp on the dataplot to the time on the timer and only render those
[16:02:05] <das3in> doesn't seem incredibly performant, but eh
[16:02:17] <duch_kazatel> you just shared the same link twice fwiw.
[16:02:53] <das3in> oops haha http://jquerytimer.com/
[16:08:41] <Crucial|2> im sure you can roll your own timer, setInterval is fairly straight forward
[16:09:20] <duch_kazatel> use recursive setTimeouts instead - http://www.thecodeship.com/web-development/alternative-to-javascript-evil-setinterval/
[16:10:23] <das3in> yeah i'm overthinking that part. I'm mostly concerned about how well it's going to render, but even then I'm overthinking. if time === timestamp ctx.draw() blah blah
[16:10:35] <das3in> Just an initial freakout, thanks everyone
[16:10:37] <duch_kazatel> way overthinking :)
[16:10:45] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't worry too much
[16:11:31] <das3in> I'm just learning, so I think i'm suffering from some imposter syndrome. this is for sure the most complicated thing I've done
[16:12:05] <duch_kazatel> so one of the biggest lessons you'll learn about javascript is that you cann't prematurely optimize.
[16:12:16] <duch_kazatel> like, be mindful, but don't worry until it's a problem.
[16:45:52] <lenswipee> hi, how to jquery this line of code: FormData(document.querySelector("form"));
[16:48:29] <rcyr> lenswipee: FormData doesn't know jQuery. Even if you select the form with jQuery, you'll still need to unwrap it: FormData($('form')[0]);
[16:54:46] <lenswipee> rcyr: FormData($('form')[0]); <-- this will work?
[16:54:53] <rcyr> Sure
[16:58:20] <duch_kazatel> or .get(0)
[17:01:41] <Horacsio> I need to add a class to a button depending to itâ€™s value. can someone help?
[17:04:30] <duch_kazatel> plenty of us can...
[17:06:03] <acidjazz> Horacsio: use .val() to grab the value, do your check then use .addClass() and/or .removeClass()
[17:06:31] <Horacsio> I tried this butâ€¦ seems wrong...
[17:06:56] <duch_kazatel> show us.
[17:07:29] <Horacsio> sorry I forgot to c&p :D $(".ylbWC-reset.button").filter('[value=Save]').addClass('save');
[17:08:03] <duch_kazatel> .filter(function() { return $(this).val() === 'Save' }).addClass('save');
[17:08:10] <duch_kazatel> though css can do attribute selectors fwiw.
[17:08:27] <duch_kazatel> .ylbWC-reset.button[value="save"] {}
[17:13:20] <Horacsio> thank you mr. duch_kazatel
[19:21:27] <tommy_s> my slider..
[19:21:30] <tommy_s> IS COMPLETE!
[19:21:33] <tommy_s> muhamuhamuha
[19:23:58] <tommy_s> duch_kazatel, are you there? :)
[21:59:22] <thomasreggi> Hey jQuery community! I'm reaching out because of this question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32753624/jquery-selector-to-json-object-representation Could use some help!
[22:11:43] <jphase> thomasreggi: did the answer on that SO post not work for you?
[22:12:14] <thomasreggi> No, it only gets at elements not attributes
[22:12:19] <thomasreggi> it's not the "real deal"
[22:12:27] <thomasreggi> @jphase ^
[22:15:34] <jphase> thomasreggi: well this is honestly more of a string manipulation within native JS rather than anything that jQuery offers a method for as it's sort of a specific utility function that most people wouldn't use
[22:16:02] <thomasreggi> Thanks for the info jphase :)
[22:16:05] <jphase> however, I'm sure that it's a fairly easy thing to do to parse the string and create a JSON object of your choice
[22:16:26] <thomasreggi> Just wanted to know before I went down that route jphase
[22:16:39] <jphase> yup, good call
[22:17:20] <thomasreggi> Curious, jQuery doesn't have a selector regex parser?
[22:17:26] <thomasreggi> jphase: ^
[22:17:59] <jphase> thomasreggi: you can extend the selector abilities, but the selector itself is literally selecting from the DOM, which you don't want
[22:19:31] <jphase> so, you could for example, add a :shadow pseudo selector by extending the jQuery's native selection method so you could do $('div:shadow') and it would select all elements that meets some condition you choose - but it's all still just selecting elements from the DOM :\
[22:20:06] <thomasreggi> This is so helpful jphase thanks I'll just create my own regex parser
[22:21:27] <jphase> sure thing
[22:55:15] <das3in> hi everyone, I have a question about using jQuery to modify canvas. As i understand... when i draw things to the canvas i'm not drawing "on top" of the canvas as much as I am modifying canvas itself. I get that, but what should I do if I want to make a square appear and then disappear after a setInterval?
[22:59:35] <happyKatt> the answer is in the question
[22:59:44] <happyKatt> 0.0
[23:00:43] <das3in> I get that... but what if the "square" is a marker and the background is a map
[23:01:10] <das3in> I can't really redraw those pixels programmatically and even if I could that'd be pretty expensive to do on a 1 second interval basis
[23:14:46] <tash> is there some way to set a style on an element on toggle?  https://jsfiddle.net/s1ornz8a/1/  If you click on Notes, I want a border on the bottom of that box.  But notice if you add it statically, it will be extra bold b/c there is a border on content-body-container.
[23:16:22] <Cork> tash: toggleClass
[23:16:37] <Cork> then just add the style changes you want to the class in the css files
[23:17:14] <Cork> (that also means you could remove the .toggle() call)
[23:52:32] <tash> Cork: stepped away for a few, just saw your comment
[23:52:59] <tash> thanks, although I'm not sure what you mean. I'll have to go look at the docs for toggleClass
[23:57:47] <tash> Cork: I'm not really following. Can you take my fiddle and show me what you mean?
[23:58:11] <tash> I did look at the api docs for toggleClass and kind of get it, but what I've tried to implement isn't working
[23:59:43] <Uhkis> gotta love the 90s table layout!
