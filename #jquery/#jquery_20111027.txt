[00:00:31] <walid> Cork: right now i have a method doesn't exist error
[00:00:32] <Cork> walid: the jQueryUpdate plugin should do that for you
[00:01:23] <walid> Cork: true. now i have 1.6 and 1.5
[00:02:08] <walid> The jQuery UI plugin is missing. Download and extract it into the sites/all/libraries directory. Rename the extracted folder to jquery.ui.
[00:02:19] <walid> THAT does not work
[00:02:45] <CrazyTux[m]> Anyone here familiar with JQuery and buttonset() ?
[00:03:15] <gnarf> are you gonna tell us its slow to load 100 buttons?
[00:03:29] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: no
[00:03:30] <gnarf> ?ask @CrazyTux[m]
[00:03:30] <bot-t> CrazyTux[m], If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:04:46] <CrazyTux[m]> I'm having an issue with a race condition where essentially I'm using buttonset on a group of checkboxes ... I'm then also doing some magic to pull the values of these 'activated' buttons (or value from the checkboxes) since the buttonset does not actually update the checked="checked" attribute.  THEN I'm passing these values upstream to an ajax service ... the problem I'm running into is a race condition between the actu
[00:05:14] <gnarf> CrazyTux[m]: you got cut off
[00:05:19] <gnarf> m I'm running into is a race condition between the actu
[00:05:34] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf:  the actual buttonset "triggering" aria-pressied="true" and the collection of the values.
[00:06:05] <gnarf> CrazyTux[m]: can you demo the problem in a minimal fiddle?
[00:06:10] <amirite> what do aria- attributes do
[00:06:21] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: also since there is no callback on the .buttonset I'm doing a separate BINDING to that same element .. which is creating the race condition
[00:06:30] <CrazyTux[m]> Not sure if there is a better way about this...
[00:06:31] <gnarf> amirite: mostly hints for screenreaders/other acceisibility stuff
[00:06:47] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: let me attempt it ... I tried yesterday but could not get it to work for some reason on jsfiddle, but I can externally...
[00:06:50] <gnarf> CrazyTux[m]: see ?p
[00:06:50] <bot-t> CrazyTux[m], Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:07:00] <amirite> basically they do nothing
[00:08:03] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: un moment.
[00:10:27] <amirite> john resig uses irssi
[00:10:34] <amirite> i saw a corner of it in a photo
[00:20:44] <walid_> Cork: still here?
[00:21:24] <Cork> ya
[00:21:53] <walid_> do you have a minute concerning this jquery update thing, or is it really not your domain?
[00:22:14] <Cork> walid_: sorry, no
[00:22:22] <walid_> Cork: alright
[00:22:27] <walid_> i'll check on #drupal
[00:22:30] <walid_> thanks, though!
[00:22:31] <walid_> :)
[00:23:24] <HexDump> hi
[00:26:19] <HexDump> I'm trying to code a view more/view less link that acts on a div with text. The div must have allways a minimum size. When the link is clicked the div must extend to show all the text and when clicked again it must collapse to the minimum size. I'm using for this slideUp/Down, but with slideUp there's no way to achieve the minimun size requirement (it allways collapse to width=0) and the other
[00:26:19] <HexDump> problem is how to know how much to extend the div to full size (all text is shown)
[00:26:30] <HexDump> could anybody provide any tip or something about this?
[00:31:27] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/7VF4e/
[00:31:54] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: Click on Ham, then click on Egg (you will see that only after Egg is clicked will HAMS value appear to 'get_aria()'
[00:35:05] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: let me know if that explanation makes sense to you - but basically its "one behind" because get_aria is checking the html for aria-pressed=true but the race condition is happening between the binding of that actual element and buttonset actually modifying "the element checked"
[00:38:59] <CrazyTux[m]> and the room goes to sleep :P
[00:41:05] <gnarf> CrazyTux[m]: im lookin
[00:41:38] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: really appreciate it ... JS is probably my worse language I program in
[00:46:06] <gnarf> hrm
[00:46:25] <CrazyTux[m]> I tell you - this simple thing I'm trying to do has been a huge pain .
[00:46:33] <CrazyTux[m]> well "simple" you would imagine.
[00:46:36] <gnarf> CrazyTux[m]: there is something wrong here
[00:46:44] <gnarf> those checkbox/buttons are supposed to save state i think
[00:46:51] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: they dont :(
[00:47:25] <CrazyTux[m]> I see something about .buttonset("refresh")
[00:47:31] <CrazyTux[m]> but that doesn't seem to do anything either...
[00:47:58] <daBo0om> hi all
[00:48:34] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/NmLck/14/ CrazyTux[m]
[00:50:00] <gnarf> CrazyTux[m]: what version of UI are you using?
[00:50:02] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: hmmm - so it is changing state?
[00:50:20] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: 1.8
[00:50:28] <gnarf> .???
[00:50:31] <CrazyTux[m]> with 1.5.2 jquery
[00:50:45] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8/jquery-ui.min.js
[00:53:06] <gnarf> CrazyTux[m]: http://jsfiddle.net/5FMgw/
[00:54:28] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: very nice!
[00:54:40] <gnarf> although that click is getting called twice
[00:54:41] <gnarf> strange
[00:55:03] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: actually this is the problem I was having..
[00:55:23] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: the first click has the incomplete data, the second has complete
[00:56:00] <gnarf> CrazyTux[m]: http://jsfiddle.net/5FMgw/1/
[00:56:08] <gnarf> bind to the input change instead
[00:56:38] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: very nice :)
[00:58:02] <gnarf> CrazyTux[m]: http://jsfiddle.net/5FMgw/2/
[01:00:06] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: ty!
[01:01:15] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: really quick... lets say I wanted to access the data OUTSIDE of the buttonset call, in other words to assign query.buttonvalues = VALUES
[01:01:31] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: could I just replace the console.log with query.buttonvalues = data ?
[01:01:41] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: I'm trying it now... but I've a bad feeling about scope on this one
[01:02:02] <gnarf> CrazyTux[m]: its stored on the inputs
[01:02:06] <gnarf> whenever you want to get it...
[01:02:40] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: hmmm I'm a bit confused with that lol
[01:02:51] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: the actual INPUT values will be "checked" now ?
[01:03:00] <gnarf> CrazyTux[m]: they always were
[01:03:53] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: hmmm I'm using google chrome debugger console where it doesnt show the attribute being set
[01:03:58] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: I wonder if its just a bug with chrome
[01:05:12] <gnarf> CrazyTux[m]: http://jsfiddle.net/5FMgw/3/
[01:05:17] <gnarf> CrazyTux[m]: the attribute isn't set
[01:05:23] <gnarf> but the checked property is set
[01:05:39] <gnarf> checking an input never sets checked="checked"
[01:06:38] <gnarf> CrazyTux[m]: http://jsfiddle.net/NmLck/19/
[01:06:48] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: so lets say I want to grab the serialized array and assign it to a value to go with an ajax query
[01:07:12] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: interesting...
[01:07:24] <gnarf> CrazyTux[m]: if all the values are already in a form, you can .serialize() it and its safe for ajax
[01:07:30] <gnarf> but like otherwise just use that map thing
[01:07:33] <asher^> whats the easiest way to just do a pause between events?
[01:08:29] <gnarf> like form.find("input[name='food[]']").map(function() { if ( this.checked ) return this.value; }).get();
[01:08:41] <gnarf> that will give you an array of all the values that are checked
[01:08:41] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: I guess where I'm getting confused though is in your example you are nesting the .buttonset call WITH the actual console.log(data)
[01:08:45] <iqbalkhan> guys,, anyone can help me, my jqGrid pagination not work
[01:09:06] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: Ah I see ok let me give this ago
[01:09:06] <iqbalkhan> this http://pastebin.com/KHbfCvDg
[01:09:58] <Darsain> what is the proper behaviour when a plugin is called on an element for a second time? should it do nothing, or should it destroy itself, and reapply?
[01:10:37] <JKarsrud> gnarf: then he should convert it to a string of 0's and 1's, and base36 encode that string.
[01:11:03] <JKarsrud> Just to preoptimize I mean

[01:22:45] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: this is just totally insane... I'm still running into the same problem hmmm
[01:32:49] <Xotix> I need a good pastebin like jsfiddle
[01:32:57] <daBo0om> jsbin
[01:33:57] <daBo0om> can someone help me out to fix a plugin :) http://jsbin.com/ifupam/2/ here is a preview of a plugin i use, it works fine on firefox but in internet explorer it doesnt work at all :/
[01:34:25] <daBo0om> maybe someone has a plugin wich does the same and works on both browsers
[01:38:20] <daBo0om> noone a idea?
[01:39:01] <daBo0om> need a plugin wich search's in a select and hides the options wich doesnt match with the search :)
[01:46:08] <gnarf> daBo0om: you have to actually remove / reappend the option elements
[01:46:20] <editdementor> Hi All.. I am sure that this is a simple question. However, I am new to jquery. Is there a way to connect to twitter user_timeline feeds through jquery.ajax? Seeing a few plugins but was wondering if it can be done directly.
[01:46:59] <daBo0om> instead of turn them invis?
[01:47:17] <daBo0om> gnarf: does that fix the ie bug, do you think?
[01:47:21] <gnarf> daBo0om: doesn't work in all browsers unless you actually remove them
[01:51:10] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: totally still struggling with this :(
[01:51:50] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: it seems when I call OUTSIDE of this snippet to retrieve the values its still the same behavior
[01:52:13] <gnarf> are you still binding to a click
[01:52:18] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: and if I call from inside - it totally just locks the browser
[01:52:27] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: I am not
[01:52:52] * gnarf shrugs
[01:53:07] <gnarf> wish i could help
[01:53:15] <gnarf> im up way past when i wanted to sleep anyway
[01:53:48] <CrazyTux[m]> gnarf: no problem, I'll keep stabbing at it - I appreciate all of your help thus far
[01:53:52] <CrazyTux[m]> get some sleep!
[01:58:04] <Xotix> hi if you have something like that http://jsbin.com/ajajaw/edit#javascript,html how do you get which child of #control was clicked?
[01:58:12] <Xotix> sry about the bold
[01:58:40] <danpvernon> Morning
[01:58:51] <Xotix> aahh inex() got it...
[01:58:53] <Xotix> hi
[02:02:05] <danpvernon> I was looking for some help with a few issues I am having with some jquery, I'm very nooby - I was using a template which had a logo carousel involved, I added a revolving quote js and it stopped my carousel from working. I don't think the old script was any good so was looking at putting a new one in.
[02:04:48] <clir-in> hi. how do i remove the current date highlight in datepicker?
[02:08:55] <juha_> Hey paul a. boivin, good job! http://paulboivin.com/blog/?p=126 i now officially hate you.
[02:09:57] <blackspotwiggins> lol
[02:10:02] <blackspotwiggins> pro js right there
[02:11:00] <juha_> this guy has all of his code examples as images, wtf
[02:13:13] <walid> hi all! i have a weird behaviour using animate...
[02:13:24] <walid> easiest would be to take a look here:
[02:13:28] <walid> www.moijconnais.com
[02:22:25] <aquatix> juha_: wtf, screenshots from some editor indeed...
[02:22:53] <asher^> how can i disable the enter key submitting forms?
[02:24:50] <asher^> actually never mind!
[02:27:14] <Xotix> hi
[02:29:42] <Xotix> go to http://tinyurl.com/3zhqh8m open firebug, click on one of the X. As you see, you get the correct index of the clicked item as wel las a âˆ’1 from index().this behavior is just, if i have it in load() like now, why?  also the delete behavior is strange cause i'd expect it throws an error if it gets an index passed which doesn't exist.
[02:34:48] <Darsain> what is the proper behaviour when a plugin is called on an element for a second time? should it do nothing, or should it destroy itself, and reapply?
[02:35:15] <blackspotwiggins> Darsain, i think if it exists, do nothing
[02:35:52] <quicksilver> I think it depends on the nature of the plugin
[02:36:04] <quicksilver> some plugins might adjust their parameters to the new ones
[02:36:19] <quicksilver> some might "attach themselves twice" if that makes sense for that kind of plugin
[02:40:50] <Xotix> why does $('#editor table tbody:first').children().eq(-1).remove(); always delete the last one? why doesn't i get a error like, "No child found with such an index"?
[02:44:04] <dabear> Xotix: negative indices is supported by .eq, and means to search backwards
[02:45:08] <Xotix> -2 would be the second last?
[02:46:01] <dabear> Xotix: do you need to ask?
[02:46:28] <Xotix> no i just tried it out.
[02:46:30] <quicksilver> Xotix: http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[02:47:30] <Xotix> thx, but im also reading it now thanks
[02:50:05] <nul0op> in jquery, why this is not working the way it's supposed to be: $('[id^="customfield_10051-12-2"] :checked')
[02:50:24] <nul0op> i want all input element (checkboxes) checked and who's id starts with customfield_10051-12-2
[02:50:33] <aaronmcadam> nul0op: u have a space
[02:51:07] <aaronmcadam> $('[id^="customfield_10051-12-2"]:checked')
[02:51:07] <nul0op> yes, just got it. sorry
[02:51:12] <aaronmcadam> horrible code tho :D
[02:51:23] <aaronmcadam> veryyyy slow
[02:51:47] <nul0op> something better ?
[02:52:04] <aaronmcadam> i take it you can't control the html
[02:53:11] <intellilogic> a select counds as an input (in a selector), right?
[02:53:19] <asher^> if i have two elements with the same id and do something to them with jquery, will it happen on one or both of the elements?
[02:53:34] <nul0op> both
[02:54:05] <asher^> ty
[02:54:33] <aaronmcadam> intellilogic: a select is not an input element, hence the different tag lol
[02:54:51] <aaronmcadam> asher^: you shouldn't have 2 els with the same id, defeats the purpose of an id
[02:55:17] <gianiaz> hi, anybody into basic plugin development can help me understand the mechanism that makes this simple example fail? http://jsfiddle.net/DmWdS/1/
[02:55:21] <asher^> yeah i know
[02:57:25] <quicksilver> gianiaz: failure to declar $myelem in the correct scope
[02:57:36] <dabear> nul0op: that's not entirely correct
[02:57:39] <gianiaz> quicksilver how I can fix it?
[02:57:40] <quicksilver> gianiaz: just put "var " before $myelem = $(this);
[02:57:45] <gianiaz> thank you
[02:57:51] <dabear> asher^: if you use #foo in your selector, only one element will be affected
[02:57:54] <gianiaz> quicksilver the same stupid error :-(
[02:57:56] <dabear> asher^: http://jsfiddle.net/5XcjD/
[02:58:17] <clir-in> hi. how do i remove the current date highlight in datepicker?
[02:58:25] <nul0op> dabear, of course since it's the id that must be unique in the dom
[02:58:54] <dabear> [id=foo] will select all elements with id="foo"
[02:59:03] <dabear> #foo will select only one element with that id
[02:59:18] <blackspotwiggins> dont encourage using multiple ids
[02:59:18] <aaronmcadam> anyway you just shouldn't do that
[02:59:27] <nul0op> ok. get it
[02:59:48] <quicksilver> pretty sure it doesn't work in all browsers anyway?
[03:00:02] <blackspotwiggins> the behaviour is undefined i think
[03:00:13] <aaronmcadam> seeing as it's RETARDEd :D

[03:12:02] <blackspotwiggins> that works eventually
[03:12:03] <aaronmcadam> hahaha :D
[03:12:10] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[03:12:16] <dabear> BlaDe^: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript and https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/document.domain
[03:12:30] <BlaDe^> does the same apply for Chrome?
[03:12:41] <aaronmcadam> Chrome is the strictest
[03:12:55] <BlaDe^> yeah, i've found that before
[03:13:03] <aaronmcadam> just because it's mozilla docs, doesn't mean it's firefox specific
[03:13:30] <aaronmcadam> MDN are the best js docs around
[03:13:57] <BlaDe^> I know that -  but some things are firefox specific
[03:14:05] <BlaDe^> I noticed window.onError is very different for example
[03:14:18] <aaronmcadam> shouldn't be
[03:14:23] <molavy> hi
[03:14:24] <aaronmcadam> javascript *version* differences maybe
[03:14:28] <molavy> how can i do this:
[03:14:31] <aaronmcadam> but not implementation
[03:14:36] <BlaDe^> aaronmcadam: it's not part of the standard and thus implemented differently
[03:14:46] <molavy>  exist_at = '\n'.search("^" + '\n')
[03:14:51] <|RicharD|> hi to all
[03:14:52] <BlaDe^> aaronmcadam: http://pastie.org/private/rhog2acdkqd3u3i6iqolta  -- firefox gives me that
[03:14:54] <veresp> hello, I have problem with cloning file input element which has file already selected in. Jquery copies also it's value, but i'm not able to clear it. Any advice?
[03:14:55] <molavy> this return error
[03:15:08] <|RicharD|> how i can convert this: $('#navmenu li a[href="/' + path + '"]').parent().addClass('select-bottom');
[03:15:10] <molavy> firebug error:
[03:15:12] <molavy> trailing \ in regular expression
[03:15:19] <|RicharD|> that read also url where /base/*
[03:15:56] <ussher_> speaking of chrome, I just moved code from my dev domain to my main domain and the page wont load in chrome. http://theartistmap.net/one/  vs http://dev.theartistmap.net/one/  the top level domain (with F12 open) stops on "Uncaught Syntax Error Unexpected Token"  "paused on an XMLHttpRequest".  The code should be exactly the same.  any ideas why?
[03:15:59] <|RicharD|> for example: href="/' + path + * '"
[03:16:03] <|RicharD|> but not work
[03:16:41] <aaronmcadam> holy fuck
[03:16:49] <aaronmcadam> have u never heard of a class
[03:17:02] <|RicharD|> if refered to me ?
[03:17:40] <molavy> any idea?
[03:18:03] <aaronmcadam> yea
[03:18:11] <aaronmcadam> or the filter function?
[03:18:18] <aaronmcadam> ?filter @ |RicharD|
[03:18:18] <bot-t> |RicharD|, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[03:19:52] <BlaDe^> document.domain hasn't made a difference on chrome, and on firefox it gives me http://pastie.org/private/rhog2acdkqd3u3i6iqolta
[03:21:20] <daBo0om> gnarf: thx for the info again dude
[03:21:33] <daBo0om> gnarf: i used appendto into a invis table and reverse :D
[03:25:55] <|RicharD|> umh don't find a solution with filter
[03:26:21] <|RicharD|> i have this: http://domain.com/events
[03:26:34] <|RicharD|> and with: 	var path = location.pathname.substring(1);
[03:26:34] <|RicharD|>   	//alert(path);
[03:26:34] <|RicharD|>   	$('#navmenu li a[href="/' + path + '"]').parent().addClass('select-bottom');
[03:26:57] <|RicharD|> work good...while if the url is http://domain.com/events/index/21
[03:27:25] <|RicharD|> it's not work because
[03:27:39] <|RicharD|> the url base in a tag is the base /events
[03:28:34] <|RicharD|> how i can use a workaround for fix it ? i want take the base of the path and all things that came next are passed as good ( /events/* )

[06:34:30] <ntoll> hey
[06:34:52] <ntoll> is there any way to force $.ajax to use jsonP and not try a CORS request.
[06:34:54] <ntoll> ..?
[06:35:09] <guynamedkeith> yes
[06:35:24] <ntoll> $.ajax({

[06:35:24] <ntoll>         });
[06:36:00] <ntoll> ^^^ is what I'm doing right now... I was expecting to see http://foo.com/whatever?callback=foo
[06:36:22] <guynamedkeith> dataTypeString : jsonp
[06:37:19] <ntoll> guybrush, awesomeness on stilts... that's hidden in the docs isn't it..?
[06:38:25] <ntoll> guybrush, whadayaknowitworks!
[06:38:30] <guynamedkeith> @ntoll http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ it's in the dataType property docs
[06:38:42] <ntoll> guynamedkeith, yeah found it... many thanks for the tip!
[06:39:09] <guynamedkeith> if you need to specify a jsonp name or prefix use the jsonp property as well
[06:39:10] <ntoll> guybrush, sorry... damn x-chat autocomplete :-/
[06:39:22] <ntoll> guynamedkeith, yeah.. I'm doing that already

[07:15:58] <brahdude> Hi, anyone who as a minute to help a jquery scrub?
[07:17:16] <Altreus> I have two click handlers on the same element but they are bound by different selectors. I need the first one to prevent the second one; I thought this is what stopImmediatePropagation was for but that doesn't do it. Will I have to set a flag visible to both to do this?
[07:18:02] <mattyh88> i've got a weird question. I have a page and when I click on a link that gives me a popup window (the page doesn't reload) the page suddenly scrolls down en textareas suddenly become tiny mce textareas. What could this be
[07:18:12] <brahdude> http://jsbin.com/uwofiw/2/edit#javascript,html
[07:18:18] <brahdude> can anyone find the bug in this?
[07:19:28] <Altreus> toggle is a click event...
[07:19:30] <danzik17> brahdude: why don't you tell us what the bug you're running into is, then we'll see if we can tell you a fix
[07:19:42] <danzik17> Altreus: can you make a demo on jsfiddle
[07:19:45] <Altreus> ?toggle
[07:19:46] <bot-t1> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[07:19:54] <Altreus> actually
[07:20:07] <danzik17> Altreus: toggle() with no params toggles visibility
[07:20:12] <brahdude> Basicly, it just won't collapse in or out.
[07:20:21] <Altreus> danzik17: yes I just spotted that :)
[07:21:36] <inad922> how can I upload a file with an ajax call? I don't want to use any plugins. I would like to write the code with at max jquery.
[07:22:01] <danzik17> brahdude: when you say collapse, what do u mean?  seems to toggle correctly
[07:22:18] <Altreus> hmm no the docs say that if I use stopImmediatePropagation then other event handlers will not be called
[07:22:21] <inad922> The input fields value is some fake value... I try to upload from linux and it sets the path to 'C;'
[07:22:25] <Altreus> but it clearly is being called because it's happening.
[07:22:39] <inad922> The input fields value is some fake value... I try to upload from linux and it sets the path to 'C:\fakepath\<file_name>'
[07:22:51] <brahdude> Danzik17: Really, If I click on the header link it won't do anything, shouldn't the text just vanish?

[08:20:55] <Oldgram> Hello! I'm having difficulties to make "sortable" of jQueryUI work naturally when the objects to be sortable are not of the same height. try this exmaple: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/ and change (using firebug for ex.) the height of the first element to 150px. now when you try to sort it you have to take it down way far away then expected. Do you have a solution for that? Thanks a lot!!

[08:48:56] <ravenzz> sabbanl hold on
[08:49:06] <webadpro> If I need to remove first x amount of charaters in a string, is there something else than subscripting?
[08:49:11] <sabbanl> @ravenzz ok thanks
[08:49:54] <webadpro> substr, i think thats the right one
[08:50:23] <ravenzz> webadpro it could be

[08:51:17] <ryanneufeld> timholum: chances are the jquery implementation is using no conflict
[08:51:18] <sabbanl> yes should I add a onClick
[08:51:39] <ravenzz> well you shouldn't if you are going to do that in jquery

[08:53:17] <johnathanb> I need to submit a pretend form.
[08:53:39] <johnathanb> I have an object or something, them things use use the .'s for and I want to post it to a page like I would a form
[08:53:47] <TheGateKeeper> hi, can someone please help me with this javascript? Im trying to make a validation with regex that changes the textbox to a reddish color when it fails, but it doesnt do anything atm. I want it to only allow text. http://pastebin.com/ps7G2eJC
[08:53:47] <johnathanb> But have it reaload the page and all that sorta stuff.
[08:54:02] <ryanneufeld> sabbanl: start here http://docs.jquery.com/How_jQuery_Works
[08:54:44] <ryanneufeld> TheGateKeeper: var regex = [A-Za-z]; is not a regex
[08:54:56] <AaronDCampbell> I don't write a lot of JS, so I'm probably missing something really obvious, but given an object like {'item1':'open','item2':'open'} is there a better way than iterating through them all to see if itemx is in that object?
[08:55:07] <TheGateKeeper> i have to add the /    /  ?
[08:55:14] <ryanneufeld> TheGateKeeper: ding ding
[08:55:16] <TheGateKeeper> thats how i usuaully do it in asp.ne and it works
[08:55:30] <ryanneufeld> TheGateKeeper: well, this isn't asp.net
[08:55:33] <AaronDCampbell> Maybe there's a better way to store them?  I don't really need the 'open' since everything in that object are IDs of elements that should be open
[08:55:38] <ryanneufeld> TheGateKeeper: this is javascript
[08:55:40] <ravenzz> sabbanl http://jsfiddle.net/Xyqry/
[08:55:41] <TheGateKeeper> ok, let me try it now
[08:55:58] <TheGateKeeper> hmmm.... it still doesnt work
[08:56:05] <TheGateKeeper> i suspect my javascript code is broken
[08:56:05] <TheGateKeeper> lol
[08:56:41] <RobW> can anyone tell me how this site is doing this: http://beta.rallyinteractive.com/contact/ (hover mouse over LEFT arrow, next to header)
[08:57:29] <ryanneufeld> TheGateKeeper: you know you can do: /[A-Za-z]/.test($('#TextBox1').val());
[08:57:45] <TheGateKeeper> no, my first time using javascript
[08:57:58] <TheGateKeeper> i dont even know how this works: if (regex.test($('#TextBox1').val()))
[08:58:07] <TheGateKeeper> what is #TextBox1?
[08:58:11] <ryanneufeld> TheGateKeeper: or even:  /[a-z]/i.test($('#TextBox1').val());
[08:58:18] <ryanneufeld> TheGateKeeper: I dunno, that's your code
[08:58:20] <TheGateKeeper> shouldnt i be calling "source"
[08:58:27] <TheGateKeeper> i found it on the internet
[08:58:27] <Joeytje50> is it possible to run a function again when something else happens, like in http://jsfiddle.net/4XHV7 ? I tried it, but apparently that doesn't work. Is there any other way?
[08:58:31] <TheGateKeeper> im trying to understand it
[08:58:49] <mr_pink> How can I make it that Jquery won't conflict with other javascript functions?
[08:58:53] <Joeytje50> It does appear that if that second function is not there, it does work: http://jsfiddle.net/4XHV7/1/
[08:59:04] <simulation> hello guys how can i find the nth child of an element that inside an div ?
[08:59:27] <simulation> for example there are 5 img in a div and i clicked the 3rd img how can i get the => 3
[08:59:46] <ryanneufeld> TheGateKeeper: well the that code is gonna try and get the value from an input with the id of TextBox1
[08:59:57] <Joeytje50> simulation: $('div img:nth-child(3)') you mean?

[09:00:45] <TheGateKeeper> ok...
[09:00:57] <Joeytje50> is it possible to run a function again when something else happens, like in http://jsfiddle.net/4XHV7 ? I tried it, but apparently that doesn't work. Is there any other way?
[09:01:02] <khmer_> simulation: use the first usage of .index, with no arguments
[09:01:04] <Joeytje50> It does appear that if that second function is not there, it does work: http://jsfiddle.net/4XHV7/1/
[09:01:09] <simulation> rmm khmer_ let me try thanks
[09:01:29] <marcelFromBerlin> try $('#pie').trigger("keyup")
[09:01:36] <khmer_> Joeytje50: that's not valid JS
[09:01:57] <Joeytje50> how could I do something like that?
[09:02:33] <Joeytje50> that if x happens: function(cake) { code } and if y happens: function(cake)
[09:02:37] <khmer_> Joeytje50: if you want to run a particular function, which has also been assigned as an event handler, then you need that function to be assigned to a variable
[09:02:40] <khmer_> or declared
[09:02:47] <simulation> khmer_ i have and class for active image ".active" if i use index() it returns the number of elements :S
[09:03:04] <khmer_> simulation: you need a single element for .index() to be useful
[09:03:12] <khmer_> simulation: i was thinking of using $(this).index() inside an event handler
[09:03:28] <Oldgram> ajpiano, unfortunately using "refreshPosition" doesn't solve it (you can try run it on the official example after changing the height of the first box)
[09:03:30] <Joeytje50> khmer_: can I just do var cake = $('#cake').keyup(function() { etc })  for this example then/
[09:03:31] <simulation> khmer_ i need to know the ".active" img s posiiton :S
[09:03:59] <khmer_> Joeytje50: http://jsfiddle.net/4XHV7/2/
[09:04:06] <webadpro> ravenzz: Thanks a lot for the help! Appreciate it. I got it working :)
[09:04:36] <Joeytje50> khmer_: doesn't seem to work?
[09:04:39] <khmer_> simulation: if there is only one .active image, then running $('.active').index() will get its position within its parent element, not within its collection...which do you need!
[09:04:44] <khmer_> Joeytje50: oh whoops, didn't finish
[09:04:56] <khmer_> Joeytje50: http://jsfiddle.net/4XHV7/3/
[09:04:57] <Oldgram> marcelFromBerlin, if it was based on the location of the mouse it would work ok, give a try to my exmaple and see that it doesn't work by the location of the pointer..
[09:05:17] <Joeytje50> ah thanks khmer_
[09:05:17] <simulation> khmer_ let me try it thanks

[09:08:13] <changerOfSea> hi guys, im using the latest version of jquery on google's servers and it seems that in IE9 only, when I have recursive call backs, it seems to call one of the levels twice, has anyone seen this before/know of a fix?
[09:08:22] <USvER> tabs and all other clickable UI elements dont get clicked too
[09:08:48] <simulation> khmer_ thanks for kind help, it works like a charm :)
[09:09:13] <USvER> it's like it's in drag mode or somethin but i dont setup any druging behaviour
[09:09:46] <changerOfSea> khmer_: any chance you could help me out?
[09:09:56] <USvER> sabbanl: you had the same problem?
[09:10:39] <bryce> I'm working on a print function and am having some difficulty with IE8.  The print function compiles information from the page, throws it in an iframe, then calls the window.print() function on the iframe.  The IE8 print dialogue then comes up.  When a user hits the "print" button IE8 becomes unresponsive and they have to use task manager to end th eprocess.
[09:11:06] <bryce> Any ideas why this might be happening? i would expect any errors to occur before the print dialogue came up.  I am also unable to reproduce the error despite mimicing the users operating system, ie version, and security settings.
[09:12:01] <Oldgram> Hello! I'm having difficulties to make "sortable" of jQueryUI work naturally when the objects to be sortable are not of the same height. try this exmaple: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/ and change (using firebug for ex.) the height of the first element to 150px. now when you try to sort it you have to take it down way far away then expected. Do you have a solution for that? (calling "refreshPositions" doesn't help) Thanks a lot!!
[09:12:07] <ccmonster> whats the best way to bind multiple events at once
[09:12:20] <USvER> Hello, i have a problem... Buttons don't get clicked when user made mousedown then some move and then mouseup (but no mouseout)...

[09:15:14] <changerOfSea> fiddle?

[09:22:44] <leo42> hi
[09:23:36] <leo42> is it possible to bind events using only the namespace.. like I can undbind all events with namespace "foo" using unbind(".foo"), can I do something like bind(".foo",...) ?
[09:24:42] <khmer_> USvER: oh boy, okay...what can i do for you
[09:25:07] <khmer_> leo42: no, because you definitely don't want to bind ALL events to anything, do you? blur and focus? mousedown and click?
[09:26:19] <leo42> khmer: surely not dom events, but custom application events, yes
[09:30:58] <ccmonster> ah yes, bind. event delegation was what through me off becuase it was a pretty general response.
[09:31:04] <ccmonster> thanks gnarf .
[09:33:20] <BarelyFitz> leo42: you might be able to look in jQuery.event.customEvent for a list of custom events, but I wouldn't recommend it
[09:35:09] <khmer_> leo42: if you're building the custom events yourself, then you know the list of events at execution time. i suggest storing them in a string! someNamespace.events.all = "event1.ns event2.ns event3.ns event.ns"; $('something').bind(someNamespace.events.all,someHandler)
[09:35:53] <TheGateKeeper> hi, can someone please help me with this javascript? Im trying to make a validation with regex that changes the textbox to a reddish color when it fails, but it doesnt do anything atm. I want it to only allow text. http://pastebin.com/ps7G2eJC
[09:37:05] <AaronDCampbell> Is there no myObject.toJson() method?
[09:37:27] <khmer_> AaronDCampbell: not without a library like modernizr. you want to use the static JSON global
[09:37:29] <AaronDCampbell> If I want to store an object somewhere (like a cookie) as text, how should I do it?
[09:37:43] <TonkaTruck> 910 users!   Jesus.
[09:37:51] <khmer_> AaronDCampbell: depending on what browsers you're supporting, you could use localStorage
[09:38:21] <khmer_> AaronDCampbell: if not, then you might need to set up a server session. i don't recommend cookies to store significantly large data, because they're passed with every request
[09:38:41] <AaronDCampbell> khmer_: Yeah, it's an extremely small bit of data
[09:38:52] <USvER> khmer_: As i said earlier i have realy annoying thing... buttons and all clickable Ui elements dont get clicked when user moved mouse in the middle of click... mousedown move then mouseup(without mouseout)... so this is like draging but i have no draging ... what can i do with it
[09:39:02] <khmer_> AaronDCampbell: then you could serialize your json
[09:39:42] <kvnn> can anyone tell me why calling a function which calls 'return false' does not return false in the scope it was called?
[09:39:43] <kvnn> http://jsfiddle.net/BqRuw/
[09:39:50] <khmer_> USvER: do you have a demonstration? it's hard to tell what the problem is. if the user doesn't know how to move their mouse, there's not much we can do
[09:41:03] <khmer_> kvnn: you're expecting the function that calls it to return false?
[09:41:13] <kvnn> yes
[09:41:15] <USvER> khmer_: it's me user... and sometimes i get this on clean jquery-UI... i clicked but it not worked becouse i moved mouse alitle....
[09:41:18] <khmer_> kvnn: when you run the return statement, it causes the currently executing function to return, not some outer function
[09:41:23] <TonkaTruck> Dear jQuery, I have a very important question concerning the error callback of .ajax.  Does it's jqXHR object have a property containing the entire body of the response?
[09:41:44] <khmer_> kvnn: nothing can force an outer function to return. the outer function has to return. one moment
[09:41:54] <khmer_> TonkaTruck: jqXHR.responseText
[09:42:15] <khmer_> kvnn: http://jsfiddle.net/BqRuw/8/
[09:42:19] <kvnn> khmer_ : do you know of a way to accomplish what I'm trying to do? I've tried a few strange things that aren't working like return 'return false' in the return_false function  then eval(retur_false())
[09:42:24] <TonkaTruck> khmer_: Ok.  So I can return JSON even though I have a "bad" status code?
[09:42:54] <kvnn> khmer_ : I've tried that too! I swear! Yours works though, thanks.
[09:42:56] <khmer_> TonkaTruck: ah, no, that's not something that all browsers will support. any service that means to support client-side XHR needs to have a mode where all responses are 200-codes.
[09:43:10] <khmer_> TonkaTruck: irritating problem with current browser tech.
[09:43:24] <khmer_> kvnn: don't be eval-ing return falses. :)
[09:43:29] <kvnn> lol
[09:43:35] <USvER> xD
[09:43:38] <khmer_> don't be evaling in general.
[09:43:45] <khmer_> Don't Be Eval
[09:43:52] <USvER> Evil!
[09:43:53] <TonkaTruck> khmer_: Ok, I was wondering.  Because that basically means I need to either 1) be less REST-ful or 2) duplicate all my REST error messages on the client.  Sad.  Very say, yes?
[09:44:06] <khmer_> TonkaTruck: afraid it does mean you need to be less RESTful.
[09:44:29] <TonkaTruck> khmer_: How will I tell my client about what went wrong on the server?
[09:44:37] <khmer_> TonkaTruck: the last REST API i had a hand in developing, we had a SuppressResponseCodes query param for all requests, and responses would all come back 200 with an X-Suppressed-Response-Code header.
[09:44:58] <khmer_> body unchanged.
[09:45:10] <TonkaTruck> khmer_: Ok.  Is that a hack that works in all browsers?
[09:45:31] <khmer_> TonkaTruck: yes, the one drawback is that certain elderly server-side proxies won't pass all http headers
[09:45:36] <khmer_> TonkaTruck: so you'll lose the original response code
[09:45:56] <khmer_> TonkaTruck: other implementations of that idea actually do modify the body when SuppressResponseCodes=true
[09:45:57] <kavelot> is it possible to call a jquery function and only continues after it finishes processing?
[09:46:08] <khmer_> TonkaTruck: and include some "httpCode" property in the response
[09:46:25] <khmer_> kavelot: that is the default thing to do. are you talking about something asynchronous, like ajax?
[09:46:43] <AaronDCampbell> khmer_: I guess I'm confused.  There's a parseJSON to do JSON -> myObject, but there's nothing to do myObject -> JSON?  In this example myObject is something like {'thing1':'open','thing2':'closed','thing3':'open'}
[09:46:59] <TonkaTruck> khmer_: Got it.  Ok I was very curious.  There was nothing in the http specification that says the body of a "bad" status code is less important than a "good" status code.  I didn't know if this was jquery oversight or a limitation of browsers.
[09:47:03] <kavelot> khmer_: no, I'm calling img.jCrop() plugin and hiding the image right after it... but jCrop is reading it after it's already hidden apparently (it's getting width=0)
[09:47:25] <AaronDCampbell> I'm not stuck on JSON, I just need a textual representation of my object that I can store in a cookie
[09:47:25] <khmer_> AaronDCampbell: jquery comes with a simple, slightly unsafe parseJSON function. modern browsers have a global JSON object with JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() methods. IE below 8 doesn't have the JSON object, so you can polyfill with json2.js
[09:47:48] <AaronDCampbell> khmer_: ahhh, I see
[09:47:50] <AaronDCampbell> Thanks
[09:48:08] <khmer_> AaronDCampbell: jquery doesn't have stringify functions
[09:48:22] <bot-t> JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[09:48:26] <khmer_> AaronDCampbell: those would be larger than the simple, unsafe parse function
[09:48:52] <USvER> khmer_: Got some time?
[09:49:00] <USvER> khmer_: =)
[09:49:05] <khmer_> TonkaTruck: yeah, that's a browser limitation. you're right that it's not in the spec
[09:49:14] <khmer_> USvER: some! what's up
[09:49:27] <USvER> khmer_: Same... With no click = )
[09:49:38] <khmer_> are you binding to click or to mousedown and then mouseup?
[09:49:55] <khmer_> kavelot: does jCrop run a setTimeout?
[09:50:00] <USvER> khmer_: you can test it on jquery-ui site... just click in the middle of the button then drag abit to the edge and unpress
[09:50:01] <khmer_> i'm unfamiliar with the plugin
[09:50:26] <khmer_> kavelot: if there's a setTimeout or setInterval in the jCrop function, it might be running asynchronously. in that case, the author should have provided a callback for when the operation is done
[09:50:27] <USvER> khmer_: and in 50% time you will get no click
[09:50:38] <khmer_> USvER: but that's expected behavior
[09:50:50] <USvER> khmer_: O_O how can i change that
[09:50:53] <khmer_> USvER: i mean, everyone has to deal with that, in all applications
[09:51:09] <USvER> khmer_: How?
[09:51:26] <khmer_> USvER: i hate to say it, but i recommend you don't. the reason it works the way it works is that a lot of HCI research has gone into reading user intent.
[09:51:34] <khmer_> USvER: if your click isn't clean, it's ignored. this makes better interfaces
[09:51:55] <USvER> khmer_: I think not =\
[09:51:59] <khmer_> USvER: if you like, you can bind to mousedown and then mouseup. just make sure it's usable.
[09:52:02] <USvER> khmer_: I have many missclicks
[09:52:05] <kavelot> khmer_: gonna check, thanks
[09:52:36] <USvER> khmer_: specialy when button is small
[09:53:03] <USvER> khmer_: So i nead to implement my own click event?
[09:54:06] <USvER> khmer_: And who in charge of that? Browser? Or it's jQuery?
[09:54:10] <dysfghsf> what is jquer

[09:59:11] <khmer_> yi_: you can wrap the parameter you want in a closure, or send that parameter as the second argument to the bind function.
[09:59:16] <khmer_> USvER: yes, one moment
[09:59:20] <USvER> khmer_: thank you for your help
[09:59:33] <khmer_> USvER: you don't need to implement your own click event, you can use use mousedown and mouseup
[09:59:41] <khmer_> USvER: i suppose it's a bit like implementing your own click event.
[09:59:53] <khmer_> USvER: because the browser click event is not going to do what you want
[10:00:00] <TonkaTruck> khmer_: I just noticed even twitter has "supress_response_codes" to return errors with a 200.  So in short, say, in twitter's position, is this: If we return you a 400 it means that something went wrong indicated in the "accompanying error message" but if you're using ajax you'll not know what that message is.  Is that correct?
[10:00:28] <khmer_> TonkaTruck: actually, i believe twitter won't return a 400 if you send suppress_response_codes.
[10:00:31] <yi_> khmer: by closure do you mean $(input).change(function() {  validate(this); });
[10:00:33] <USvER> khmer_: ok thank you! rly thank you very much
[10:00:42] <khmer_> TonkaTruck: instead the response body will give you what you want
[10:00:44] <TonkaTruck> khmer_: Yes, that's correct.
[10:00:47] <USvER> khmer_: cos i culdn't find any info on that =\
[10:00:52] <khmer_> yi_: exactly.
[10:01:04] <eddiemonge> yi_: that function you are passing to .change() is an anonymouse function, not a closure
[10:01:10] <yi_> khmer_: ok I tried that and it didn't appear to work
[10:01:39] <khmer_> eddiemonge: well once you're calling the real handler from inside your anonymous function, the anonymous function forms a closure.
[10:01:49] <khmer_> yi_: can you demonstrate in a fiddle?
[10:01:52] <yi_> do I need to do var obj = this; and then $(inp).change(function() { validate(obj); };
[10:02:13] <yi_> basically I want to pass the parent object to the function
[10:02:19] <khmer_> TonkaTruck: so yeah, that's correct
[10:02:28] <khmer_> yi_: oh, i see! yes, that's exactly what you do
[10:02:40] <khmer_> yi_: you need to save "this" as a local variable, because inside an event handler, the scope changes.
[10:02:53] <khmer_> ahem, not the scope, the context.
[10:03:25] <yi_> khmer_: thanks it took me a long time to figure out "this" was pointing at an input element and not to my class or jquery widget that I was expecting
[10:04:05] <khmer_> yi_: no problem, i'm glad you got it. that is a jquery fundament
[10:04:48] <yi_> khmer_: do I need to be concerned with memory consumption passing the parent object in that way?  Does it make a copy of it?
[10:05:35] <khmer_> yi_: yes, and no. you need to be concerned with memory consumption if you have a pattern that continuously generates those closures when events happen, like that first idea with the anonymous function in the handler. IE sub 7 doesn't properly release memory once a closed variable becomes inaccessible
[10:05:55] <khmer_> yi_: for IE, you have to set variables to null when you're about to make them inaccessible.
[10:06:12] <khmer_> yi_: however, it doesn't literally make a copy of it. it just preserves it from being garbage collected, so it's still accessible in the scope chain.
[10:06:37] <shodan45> I'm using jquery ui's .sortable to let the user sort a list, but I also need an "auto sort" button. Is there an existing way to do that?
[10:07:13] <yi_> khmer_: good to know.. I'll set it to null to make sure there are no problems in IE
[10:07:55] <khmer_> good on ya
[10:08:58] <TonkaTruck> khmer_: Just messing with JMVC and trying to fit in some good error handling.  Thanks for your help.
[10:09:04] <khmer_> tnoknp
[10:09:14] <khmer_> ok lemme try that again
[10:09:16] <khmer_> TonkaTruck: np
[10:09:27] <Jakey> TonkaTruck JMVC?
[10:09:32] <Jakey> what framework is that
[10:09:38] <khmer_> javascriptMVC
[10:11:13] <Jakey> i know
[10:11:28] <Jakey> TonkaTruck what are you using
[10:11:43] <TonkaTruck> Jakey: What do you mean?
[10:11:57] <TonkaTruck> Oh wait...I think I know what has happened here.
[10:12:09] <khmer_> there's a jmvc.net too, yeah, yeah
[10:12:16] <TonkaTruck> http://javascriptmvc.com ambiguous name
[10:12:44] <TonkaTruck> Ambiguous?  That's not the word I was looking for.
[10:13:43] <Jakey> lol TonkaTruck
[10:13:51] <Jakey> is that the official for what you are using?
[10:14:22] <khmer_> Jakey: get to the point pls
[10:14:39] <kvnn> Are there anything like 'return continue' that will not stop execution?
[10:14:41] <TonkaTruck> Jakey: Yes.  I do the whole huge package too.  Don't just download parts.  Only a tiny fraction of that code ends up on your app.
[10:14:41] <Jakey> official site for jmvc
[10:14:43] <seqastian> ambitious?
[10:15:33] <khmer_> kvnn: i'm worried that the questions you're asking betray a slight lack of understanding about how functions work
[10:15:42] <TonkaTruck> seqastian: I think I was going for Ambiguous #2) "Unclear or inexact because a choice between alternatives has not been made."
[10:15:46] <khmer_> kvnn: a return statement returns a value from the function call
[10:16:15] <TonkaTruck> seqastian: i.e.  it's a "javascript mvc framework" but it's not named something cute with a bird on it.
[10:16:32] <TonkaTruck> open source software communications 101
[10:16:38] <seqastian> mhm
[10:16:43] <seqastian> thats why you use backbone :p
[10:16:59] <TonkaTruck> See, "backbone" everyone knows what you're talking about.
[10:17:16] <ice_> Hi, I want to search for "<h2>Berichte</h2>" in the div with the id = #content_value - I tried if($('#content_value').find('h2').val() = 'Berichte') but it is not working.
[10:17:37] <kvnn> khmer_ : let me show an example : http://jsfiddle.net/BqRuw/11/ . If I simply do 'return x' in a function, does it always stop execution?
[10:17:44] <Woet> ?docs .val @ ice_
[10:17:45] <bot-t> ice_, .val() - Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[10:17:49] <khmer_> seqastian: well, it's a competitor to backbone
[10:17:54] <Woet> ?docs .text @ ice_
[10:17:55] <bot-t> ice_, .text() - Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[10:17:58] <khmer_> seqastian: is that inconceivable to you
[10:18:27] <kvnn> khmer_ : I think I understand what you were saying now.
[10:18:44] <khmer_> kvnn: the function has returned a value, so it finishes executing. yes, you must always stop executing when you return. but listen, i think i know what you're getting at
[10:18:44] <kvnn> and the answer to my above question, i believe is 'yes'
[10:18:59] <khmer_> kvnn: is what you want to stop the default action from happening when you click a link?
[10:19:02] <TonkaTruck> seqastian: I wouldn't knock backbone I just happen to like jmvc because of the command line tools and it's overall jquery-ness
[10:19:10] <khmer_> kvnn: and somehow to do that without returning false from the function?
[10:19:15] <kvnn> khmer_ : upon a condition, yes
[10:19:17] <eddiemonge> ?preventDefault @ kvnn
[10:19:18] <bot-t> kvnn, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[10:19:20] <eddiemonge> that? ^^ ?
[10:19:21] <kvnn> i understand I could use a conditional
[10:19:26] <kvnn> preventDefault doesn't work here
[10:19:36] <khmer_> why not
[10:19:41] <eddiemonge> sorry. i dont know what your question is
[10:19:46] <kvnn> stopImmediatePropagation should work, but doesnt
[10:19:59] <khmer_> eddiemonge: that's what i was getting at, yes
[10:20:10] <kvnn> because i'm trying to stop some different bindings of the same element, not parent elements
[10:20:20] <seqastian> but but the NAME .. nah i dont know anything about either just tried to keep the 'name' joke going
[10:20:25] <kvnn> i can provide an example
[10:20:33] <khmer_> kvnn: do you want to use stopPropagation or what
[10:20:44] <Joeytje50> How come that in http://jsfiddle.net/eLY3a/ the checkbox doesn't make the script work or not, even though it should work when checked and not when unchecked?
[10:20:59] <Joeytje50> I put an if around it to check if the checkbox is :checked
[10:21:01] <kvnn> khmer_ : stopImmediatePropagation would be the ticket but it hasn't worked in this situation. I'll link an example
[10:21:04] <ice_> Woet: thanks I will try it :)
[10:21:13] <khmer_> Joeytje50: you need to put the if in the event handler, not outside it
[10:21:18] <eddiemonge> kvnn: oh so multiple things have been bound to one element and you only want some of them to fire?
[10:21:22] <khmer_> Joeytje50: you're checking whether the box is checked on pageload!
[10:21:40] <Joeytje50> oh I see
[10:22:19] <eddiemonge> Joeytje50: you are binding only if thats checked. but once they are bound, they stay bound. you need to move the check into the binding function
[10:23:15] <kvnn> eddiemonge: exactly
[10:23:18] <shodan45> no one has any ideas on my question? ;(
[10:23:21] <kvnn> khmer_ : http://jsfiddle.net/BqRuw/11/
[10:23:40] <kvnn> so I think I'll just have to use a conditional.
[10:23:45] <khmer_> shodan45: there is no autosort function...you'd have to write one!
[10:23:46] <eddiemonge> Joeytje50: http://jsfiddle.net/eLY3a/2/
[10:24:03] <eddiemonge> kvnn: then you will have to set flags in your bindings to do what you want only when you want it
[10:24:12] <Joeytje50> ah thanks
[10:24:16] <eddiemonge> kvnn: or else unbind all the elements and then rebind after
[10:24:24] <eddiemonge> shodan45: whats your question?
[10:24:30] <kvnn> eddiemonge: which is what I was trying to avoid. I have multiple elements that should only be fired if something is true
[10:24:52] <kvnn> word up, I'm good
[10:24:58] <kvnn> thanks yall
[10:25:12] <khmer_> word to your mother
[10:25:17] <eddiemonge> kvnn: then yeah, you need flag checks similiar to Joeytje50
[10:25:39] <kvnn> don't compare me to him.
[10:25:46] <kvnn> ;) good day everyone
[10:26:25] <eddiemonge> Joeytje50: you were also missing semi-colons in your code. you should always be terminating with semi-colons
[10:26:44] <Joeytje50> oh I heard those are not needed actually
[10:27:01] <shodan45> eddiemonge: I'm using jquery ui's .sortable to let the user sort a list, but I also need an "auto sort" button. Is there an existing way to do that?
[10:27:20] <eddiemonge> Joeytje50: they arent. but you should have them. its a best practice
[10:27:37] <Joeytje50> oh ok
[10:28:09] <bapi_> ok weird problem, I use a animated gif for loading, it works when i place it in a static page, but whenever I try to call the image from ajax it stops the animation after 1 second, what can be the cause?
[10:28:12] <eddiemonge> Joeytje50: this is better: http://jsfiddle.net/eLY3a/3/
[10:28:35] <bapi_> <img src='ajax-load.gif'>
[10:28:42] <eddiemonge> shodan45: not really
[10:30:09] <eddiemonge> bapi_: sounds like a jsfiddle-able issue
[10:35:18] <supsup> anyone here use html5 boilerplate?
[10:38:21] <PRW> any CSS wizards out there? http://pastie.org/2768682
[10:38:31] <jedimind> PRW, #css
[10:39:34] <eddiemonge> supsup: doubtful. no one uses that
[10:39:55] <eddiemonge> pamelafoxx: you hang out in here?
[10:40:37] <eddiemonge> PRW: jsfiddle would probably be a better place to paste that
[10:40:45] <eddiemonge> supsup: that was :sarcasm: by the way
[10:41:09] <yamahaalex37> is it possible to use jquery in an external .js file, if jquery is only linked in index.html
[10:41:27] <supsup> yah i got it.
[10:41:36] <yamahaalex37> in my index.html i linked jquery, in another external .js i am trying:
[10:41:36] <yamahaalex37>  $(document).ready(function(){
[10:41:36] <yamahaalex37>    alert("test3");
[10:41:36] <yamahaalex37>  });
[10:41:38] <supsup> i got help in html5 channel more proper place to ask anyway~~
[10:41:38] <yamahaalex37> its not working
[10:41:39] <eddiemonge> yamahaalex37: what do you mean? you load jquery in and then do your scripts after
[10:41:52] <eddiemonge> yamahaalex37: whats not working about it?
[10:41:54] <bsod2> if you include jquery first in your html, the following js includes work
[10:42:18] <bsod2> it all ends up in the same js interpreter
[10:42:22] <yamahaalex37> oh i guess that was it then
[10:42:24] <ccmonster> hm, i want to hack the autocomplete, but just have it populate my responses.
[10:42:32] <yamahaalex37> i linked my main.js before i linked jquery.js
[10:42:42] <ccmonster> not autocomplete as much as just have the event/error/ui handling
[10:42:51] <yamahaalex37> so i just need to link jquery first than all the rest linked .js can use it
[10:43:02] <yamahaalex37> didnt know the order mattered, thanks
[10:44:11] <eddiemonge> yamahaalex37: just a tip but you might want to read some javascript/web dev books to learn javascript first
[10:44:11] <bot-t> (1 min 22 secs ago) <darcyclarke> tell eddiemonge I'm doing that with ajpiano danheberden and addyosmani for the learning site right now
[10:44:27] <ccmonster> anyone have any experience modifying the autocomplete
[10:44:28] <eddiemonge> darcyclarke: finally stuff is getting done?
[10:44:38] <darcyclarke> obviously >_>
[10:44:39] <darcyclarke> :P
[10:45:38] <yamahaalex37> eddiemonge, you are saying that it is js common knowledge that the order mattered?
[10:46:33] <Woet> yamahaalex37: yes.
[10:46:38] <eddiemonge> yamahaalex37: yeah. but more so that you should have a solid grasp of the basics for javascript before tackling jquery. it will help your code so much
[10:47:07] <yamahaalex37> ok, i agree jquery makes me copy paste too much
[10:47:20] <yamahaalex37> but then, i seem to need it so much for simple things like a vibrate hover effect
[10:47:33] <yamahaalex37> which i would like to just do from scratch with JS to practice
[10:47:54] <eddiemonge> yamahaalex37: for those type of things jquery is great and using pure javascript is a headache
[10:48:32] <yamahaalex37> ok well i will try to find a good book because i want to learn js and jquery really good
[10:48:49] <yamahaalex37> packtpub seems to have a lot on sale for $10.99 this month
[10:48:50] <supsup> i know a good one
[10:48:58] <bot-t> yamahaalex37, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[10:49:03] <yamahaalex37> ok what is it
[10:49:07] <supsup> well u said js
[10:49:08] <supsup> right
[10:49:11] <bot-t> yamahaalex37, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[10:49:14] <supsup> so first read eloquent javascript
[10:49:19] <supsup> then read Javascript Enlightment
[10:49:26] <supsup> then read Javascript the GOod parts
[10:49:31] <yamahaalex37> holy crap, an opensource book
[10:49:32] <supsup> then read that jquery fundamentals
[10:50:03] <yamahaalex37> that open source book looks awesome thanks
[10:50:10] <supsup> Eloquent JS -> Javascript Enlightment -> Javascript The good Parts -> JqFundamentals
[10:50:15] <supsup> imo
[10:50:30] <yamahaalex37> eloquent js is the free one you linked right
[10:50:39] <supsup> the online version is
[10:50:40] <eddiemonge> yamahaalex37: actually, a good start would be with: http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Patterns-Stoyan-Stefanov/dp/0596806752
[10:50:56] <supsup> i don't think thats a good intro book
[10:50:56] <ccmonster> not sure how to get the results out of the autocomplete
[10:51:05] <ccmonster> autocompletesearch event doesn't seem to give me the actual reesult list
[10:51:17] <supsup> Patterns is a good book but after Enlightment
[10:51:17] <yamahaalex37> oh so supsup, read this one last? http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[10:51:22] <eddiemonge> supsup: i do, especially for jquery right after
[10:51:33] <supsup> it's a good book but bad intro
[10:51:41] <supsup> just like good parts
[10:51:45] <ProLoser|Work> looking for more people for the turntable room
[10:52:09] <patrick99e99> is there a way to do a find("input") and return all inputs except for [type=radio] ?
[10:52:10] <supsup> well u should learn JS before u learn jquery imop
[10:52:28] <mexitlian> hello all
[10:52:38] <mexitlian> I am using jQuery and really enjoying myself
[10:52:49] <eddiemonge> patrick99e99: $('input').not('[type="radio"]')
[10:52:52] <supsup> i think: $("input").not()
[10:52:54] <supsup> yah
[10:52:56] <supsup> eddit did it
[10:52:58] <yamahaalex37> ok then eloquentjs looks great, thansk a lot
[10:53:00] <patrick99e99> eddiemonge: woo hoo!
[10:55:11] <amh345> is there a way to read a 3 digit number in a <span>123</span>  and than have jquery read each number in the string and convert it to images?
[10:55:53] <amh345> when i say convert it to images. i should say load an image for each number in the string. effectively replacing whats there with a series of numeric images.
[10:55:54] <eddiemonge> amh345: use jquery to get the text and then use pure js to work the string magic and then use jquery to crate the images and inject it back in the dom
[10:55:57] <asher^> amh345 yeah, give it an id
[10:56:02] <asher^> not too hard
[10:56:35] <eddiemonge> asher^: it is kind of hard based on that description
[10:57:01] <amh345> hmm
[10:57:06] <asher^> hmm, i guess it depends on what he means by 'convert it to images'
[10:57:14] <asher^> amh345 you have premade images already, yes?
[10:57:15] <amh345> when i say convert it to images. i should say load an image for each number in the string. effectively replacing whats there with a series of numeric images.
[10:57:25] <amh345> yes, the images are premade.  0-9
[10:57:25] <asher^> amh345 thats not too tricky
[10:57:48] <ccmonster> anyone have experience with autocomplete or could lend a quick hand?
[10:58:04] <eddiemonge> amh345: this would work best as a plugin
[10:58:04] <ccmonster> trying to tweak the jquery ui autocomplete a bit.
[10:58:23] <amh345> does anyone know of any examples or terms i can search for this image thing?
[10:59:57] <asher^> amh345 .html is a start :)
[11:00:00] <amh345> im guessing i need to cycle each value in the string and parse and image to it?
[11:00:14] <asher^> use it to get the contents, then change it to images, then use .html to put the new ones back in
[11:00:36] <chovy> amh345: <span>123</span> becomes <span><img src="1.png" /><img src="2.png" />...</span>?
[11:00:45] <amh345> it's the changing to images part im lost on.  getting the value and putting the new one back souldnt be a problem.
[11:00:50] <amh345> chovy: yes, that's exactly it
[11:01:14] <chovy> you can use a regex to split on digits, then rewrite the html.
[11:01:28] <aaroninfidel> in jQuery how can I add a listener for when someone clicks a link, then check that link for which url they're trying to hit?
[11:01:28] <asher^> amh345, get the values, split them up, then insert them in the <img src.. string, put them back to back, then .html them back in
[11:01:32] <amh345> like just add a .jpg to the return value?
[11:01:44] <Michael> Chris____: what up
[11:01:53] <Chris____> Yo
[11:02:04] <aaroninfidel> I don't want to listen for all links on the page because thats a lot of listeners...
[11:02:12] <est3> asher: $("#elem").attr("href");
[11:02:16] <cliffordmeece> what is the recommended way of using a query ui 'button' if I want to use one of the framework icons instead of the default button look?  In other words, I want to use one those small framework icons as a button.
[11:02:23] <amh345> so regex is what i'll need to do to actually split the numbers up.  nothing in jquery for that?
[11:02:27] <est3> i mean aaroninfidel
[11:02:58] <est3> $(this).attr("href"); inside the click listener
[11:03:07] <cliffordmeece> one of these, in other words: http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/images/?new=454545&w=256&h=240&f=png&fltr[]=rcd|256&fltr[]=mask|icons/icons.png
[11:03:22] <est3> can add a click listener to all a's if you want with one listener
[11:03:22] <eddiemonge> amh345: http://jsfiddle.net/qgUYG/
[11:03:55] <amh345> eddiemonge: damn.  thank you so much!  you just saved me hours!
[11:04:43] <eddiemonge> amh345: and its reusable on anything you call .image_replace() on
[11:04:46] <ccmonster> yo eddiemonge , any chance you could help me tweak the autcomplete ? Trying to handle the events and Im clearly missing something
[11:05:00] <eddiemonge> ccmonster: you know the rule. see ? pe
[11:05:01] <bot-t> ccmonster, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[11:05:07] <cliffordmeece> obviously i could just do this: <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-circle-plus"></span>
[11:05:24] <cliffordmeece> and then attach actions, but i was wondering if there was an easier, preferred way, like that would leverage the normal .button() abilities
[11:05:44] <eddiemonge> cliffordmeece: http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#icons
[11:05:54] <ccmonster> just about getting access to the autocomplete results and handling them. i will fiddle something
[11:06:13] <amh345> eddie, if i check the source the source loads images that are different than the string value.  for ex:  string is 132  and images are 0.png 1.png 2.png
[11:06:18] <amh345> eddiemonge: ^
[11:06:28] <aaroninfidel> when I click a link, how can I make it stop where its going?
[11:06:36] <amh345> preventDefault
[11:06:50] <cliffordmeece> @eddiemonge, yep, exactly.  thanks.
[11:06:54] <aaroninfidel> amh345: isn't there another one like... stopPropigation too?
[11:07:18] <amh345> oh. i have no idea.  i just no of preventDefault (im very bad with jquery)
[11:07:20] <JAAulde> I know that in jQuery, using .remove() is the best method for getting an element out of the DOM as jQuery can clean up associated data/events to avoid memory leaks. But what about .empty()? If I have a lot of DOM which needs to be wiped from an element, does using .empty() cause possible memory leak issues?
[11:07:34] <chovy> amh345: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/crsLM/
[11:07:39] <ajpiano> JAAulde: they will all get cleaned up
[11:07:46] <JAAulde> ajpiano: awesome, thanks
[11:07:50] <aaroninfidel> amh345: that isn't jQuery... thats JavaScript...
[11:08:16] <eddiemonge> amh345: well you got to fiddle with it to actually use the values
[11:08:41] <eddiemonge> ?stoppropagation @ aaroninfidel
[11:08:41] <bot-t> aaroninfidel, event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[11:08:46] <eddiemonge> ?preventdefault @ aaroninfidel
[11:08:46] <bot-t> aaroninfidel, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[11:09:20] <amh345> eddiemonge: that's working. but if there is more than one span with digits in it. it dups the results.  i think http://jsfiddle.net/crsLM/1/
[11:09:29] <eddiemonge> ajpiano: so no more having to do .empty().remove() to remove all bound events?
[11:09:35] <aaroninfidel> eddiemonge: thank you :)
[11:10:00] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: it's worked that way for quite some time
[11:10:09] <ajpiano> also .empty().remove() would just break your page
[11:10:14] <eddiemonge> amh345: thats why you need a class or something because that code says do all that to all spans at once
[11:10:14] <ajpiano> cause you'd remove the elemente you emptied
[11:10:50] <eddiemonge> ajpiano: i think as of 1.4.x remove didnt completely unbind events
[11:11:06] <ccmonster> ok. I got a fiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/S9tHT/
[11:11:22] <ajpiano> yea that sounds right
[11:11:33] <chovy> amh345: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/crsLM/2/
[11:11:51] <ccmonster> trying to make the autocomplete results go into the normal 'Search Results' box.
[11:11:59] <eddiemonge> amh345: http://jsfiddle.net/qgUYG/1/
[11:12:02] <amh345> chovy: that did it.  did you just write this whole thing now?
[11:12:10] <amh345> eddiemonge, i mean
[11:12:11] <chovy> amh345: yeah
[11:12:22] <amh345> you guys are crazy impressive!
[11:12:31] <eddiemonge> ajpiano: so that changed with 1.5.ish?
[11:12:33] <chovy> it wasn't that difficult.
[11:12:51] <amh345> you guys do freelance?
[11:12:56] <eddiemonge> amh345: its the same one i sent you earlier with the tweak of actually using the number instead of the counter
[11:13:08] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: i'm not entirely sure
[11:13:10] <chovy> amh345: not really, why?
[11:13:12] <eddiemonge> amh345: plus, mines reusable over and over
[11:13:25] <eddiemonge> amh345: i do
[11:14:05] <amh345> chovy: im trying to find people that i can offload things too
[11:15:40] <amh345> when you guys busted out those solution-- it made me realize just how much time i was :(
[11:15:43] <amh345> waste*
[11:15:55] <asher^> learning isnt wasting time
[11:16:28] <asher^> ive been coding my butt off the last couple of days, a lot of frontend stuff (im usually back end) and ive learned a lot :)

[11:18:25] <henbone> Anyone able to help or point me in the right direction with jquery form plugin issue? I'm uploading files, and it's successful but the response in the success callback is null.
[11:18:54] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ henbone
[11:18:54] <bot-t> henbone, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[11:19:37] <henbone> bot-t: alright, it will take a few mins
[11:19:39] <bot-t> henbone, JQuerySprint/demos/irclog - All times are EDT(GMT-4) http://docs.jquery.com/JQuerySprint/demos/irclog
[11:19:57] <eddiemonge> bot-t: who are you?
[11:19:58] <bot-t> eddiemonge, As I see it, yes.
[11:20:11] <sente> I have an array of a 100 usernames, for each name I want need to make a ajax/jsonp request to youtube to get user info, I want to be able to throttle this elegantly so I don't send off all the asynchronous requests right at the start (and then get rate-limited..) -- what are the best practices/plugins for throttling asynchronous calls like this?
[11:25:29] <guynamedkeith> @sente checkout async.js
[11:28:50] <Whirl3d> simple simple question that seems odd in the api docs: does ($("p.someclass").html("<p class='otherclass'>test</p>"); replace the first paragraph completely or does it combine the two or just replace the insides?
[11:30:23] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: just replaces the inside html
[11:30:44] <Whirl3d> eddiemonge, thx. just what I needed
[11:31:29] <asher^> :D
[11:31:33] <guynamedkeith> @sente simplest way, make a function that wraps your request, then loop through your array of names and use setTimeout(fnName, ms)
[11:31:42] <ciro_nunes> Whirl3d: if you do that you have one p element inside other
[11:32:23] <sente> guynamedkeith: thank you. it seems there popular-ish async.js's https://github.com/caolan/async and https://github.com/eligrey/async.js, they're unrelated
[11:32:26] <Whirl3d> ciro_nunes, that was my fear.
[11:32:39] <sente> guynamedkeith: that's what i've already done
[11:34:14] <Whirl3d> I have an array of error messages that I need to put into an existing <p> element. When I use var msg= array.join("<br/>"); $(existingp).html(msg), I'm getting the literal text with the characters < b r / > not linebreaks.
[11:34:14] <Thomas`-> hi everybody. is there anyway to get the max-height of a div without the "px"?
[11:34:20] <FelipeMorais> Whirl3d: see: http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[11:35:14] <Thomas`-> i meant min-height actually
[11:35:22] <sente> guynamedkeith: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/499158/ this is what I did which worked but it's not legit
[11:35:33] <Whirl3d> FelipeMorais, thanks a lot. Never seen replaceWith before. It should solve my problem.
[11:36:30] <ProLoser|Work> how can i see if a var is an array or an object literal?
[11:37:35] <Whirl3d> .replaceWith will destroy var references to the original element...back to the drawing board.
[11:38:14] <msnook> Hey all, I'm trying remove all the .click bindings from an elementâ€¦ does anyone know how? do i just set .click(function(){return false;}) or something?
[11:38:46] <ciro_nunes> msnook: http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[11:38:55] <ohsnap> Hi guys, how can I prevent the text from growing from the left when doing this? $('.show-more').click(function() { $('#read-more').toggle('fast'); });
[11:39:06] <emattias> Is it possible to "hook" into another function? I want to say "when function infieldLabel() is applied to an element, also do xxx()
[11:39:06] <chovy> msnook: $('#myimage').unbind('click');
[11:39:20] <msnook> awesome, ciro_nunes and chovy, thank you
[11:40:45] <devc> I've copied and pasted a piece of code to two different parts of my js file and in one place jQuery's not able to get the element with a passed variable $('#'+objectId); but the next one IS -- I know this means that the object must not be instantiated yet but I am confused on how to re-arrange my code to make it work.
[11:41:51] <msnook> emattias: it's possible to set var augmentedFunction = function() { previousFunction(); newCommands(); }
[11:42:20] <emattias> msnook: sneaky! I like it! =)
[11:42:23] <ohsnap> looks like slideToggle instead of toggle is the answer :)
[11:42:27] * sneakyness slaps emattias around a bit with a large trout
[11:42:41] <dantti> I'm searching google but not sure which terms should I use, I have a link, when I click the ajax page load, but not into the div that I want.. any tips http://pastebin.com/696wM8ft
[11:42:58] <chovy> devc: jsfiddle?
[11:43:00] <emattias> sneakyness: mm, tnx! =)
[11:43:18] <dantti> the alert works btw
[11:43:45] <devc> chovy: http://clients.jpgninja.com/kidzsmart.com/book02/ can we try it with my dev server first?
[11:44:03] <dantti> it seems that the page is loaded into the div but after that the current page refreshes..
[11:44:38] <chovy> devc: which part are you loosing scope?
[11:45:09] <devc> chovy: When it loads you can see the characters slide in -- but that's incorrect.. Click in the white space below "Pages" and you'll see everything fade in, then click it again and the light will "turn off"
[11:45:19] <devc> and that's how I'd like it to load.
[11:45:38] <PRW> does $("#myUL").children().last().filter(".old") work to only return the last element if it has class "old"
[11:45:58] <PRW> or should i do last().hasClass(".old")
[11:46:55] <devc> I just commented out one of my console.log's... If you want to refresh you'll see the correct consoling.
[11:47:10] <PRW> i didnt want to use hasClass because i wanted to chain remove();
[11:47:25] <PRW> but filter() doesn't seem to be working
[11:47:45] <devc> chovy: In the console.log's where you have "undefined / undefined" coming through, you're trying to pull "objectId / .data('effect')"
[11:48:00] <devc> If oyu then switch the light on and off, you'll see the console's logging correctly.
[11:48:58] <devc> chovy: So lines 296-302 have the initial calls (.slide method is working, .fade isn't)
[11:49:21] <devc> chovy: and lines 271-277 are what's firing when you click.
[11:49:39] <ProLoser|Work> text.replace(/:value/g, value);
[11:49:50] <ProLoser|Work> if value is a variable containing a stringâ€¦ how do i fix this?
[11:50:12] <devc> chovy: and if it matters, .fade() accepts: id, alpha, duration, timeout
[11:51:31] <jmzzz> join #javascript
[11:52:07] <chovy> devc: which variable is not accessible? and from what block?
[11:53:19] <devc> The Environment.fade() method on line 217. objectId comes through the function but line 220 isn't able to grab the element on the page.
[11:53:29] <ccmonster> ok. I got a fiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/S9tHT/ , anyone able to help manipulate the jquery ui autocomplete?
[11:54:03] <longtheta> PAUL IRISH
[11:54:06] <longtheta> YOU HERE BRAH?
[11:54:32] <devc> lol @ brah. You killin' us out here!
[11:54:38] <defunct> hello, does anyone know why using an alert() here will not allow the return false; to function? http://pastie.org/2769151
[11:55:09] <msnook> defunct: return false will only fire after alert is closed
[11:55:31] <defunct> msnook: is there some way I can get a message on the screen using something like this?
[11:55:56] <msnook> you probably want to use a modal instead of the built-in alert, but others here might know more about how alerts affect threading and so on (i don't)
[11:56:08] <msnook> jquery UI makes modals pretty easy
[11:56:08] <defunct> ok, thanks
[11:56:11] <msnook> see .dialog
[11:56:14] <ProLoser|Work> value is a variable containing a string, what do? text.replace(/:value/g, value);
[11:59:19] <sgrover> If I do $('#mydiv').html(htmlTable); where the table is large (9000+rows), is it normal for IE8 to choke?  It's taking many minutes to show the table...
[11:59:27] <ajpiano> yes
[11:59:42] <ajpiano> that's literally over 9000
[11:59:45] * sgrover likes nice quick answers like that
[12:00:18] <sgrover> understood, but other test browsers handle the new HTML in seconds, not minutes.
[12:01:01] <ajpiano> i believe modern browsers process JS up to 200x faster than oldie
[12:01:04] <hfaafb> IE8 has a slower JS engine.
[12:02:00] <sgrover> Thanks.  That's info I can give the client and encourage them to update.  Their stuck with IE8 though due to some gov websites they need that don't work in newer...
[12:04:06] <sgrover> ahhhh... turns out the tablesorter plugin was where the delays were...
[12:04:06] <Ximm> why hello there sgrover!
[12:05:14] * sgrover nods at Ximm... wondering who they are... :)
[12:05:16] <datlap> im using jquery datepicker calendar that has from and to date. how can i calculate to-from (from date - to  date) and display it without reloading the page
[12:05:17] <Ximm> why howdy there datlap!
[12:06:16] <devc> chovy:  did you give up on it? haha
[12:06:16] <Ximm> why howdy there devc!
[12:06:29] <devc> Why hello there Ximm !
[12:06:29] <Ximm> why howdy there devc!
[12:06:36] <devc> Oh I see.
[12:06:36] <Ximm> why howdy there devc!
[12:07:20] <sgrover> datlap: you need to do some date math.  Something like this:  f = new Date($('#fromdate')); t = new Date($('#todate'));  delta = (t.getTime() - f.getTime()) / 1000 / 60 / 60;
[12:07:20] <Ximm> why howdy there sgrover!
[12:08:26] <chovy> devc: yes :)
[12:08:40] <devc> chovy: Thanks for trying.
[12:08:45] <sgrover> the getTime() methods return microseconds.  So divide that by 1000 to get seconds, divide again by 60 to get minutes, and 60 again to get hours, then finally 24 to get days... (missed that last part on my sample)
[12:08:56] <devc> Anyone else wanna take a stab at an annoying probem of scope/timing?
[12:09:24] <sgrover> sorry devc - too many of my own at the moment.. :(
[12:10:02] <devc> sgrover: Any chance that a fresh set of eyes will help? My JS isn't super strong but I'm probably intermediate level -- might be able to help.

[12:26:03] <jedimind> youre not preventing the form from submitting at any point dwarder
[12:26:16] <jedimind> oh wait youre just expanding .validator
[12:26:17] <jedimind> nevermind

[12:30:47] <dwarder> and just submits my form....
[12:33:31] <Zerxer> sounds like you're breaking it
[12:34:37] <dwarder> i wish i knew
[12:34:39] <dwarder> how
[12:37:32] <ccmonster> anyone hacked up the autocomplete before?
[12:38:21] <ravenzz> dwarder can you create a working example? is the regex correct?
[12:38:40] <ravenzz> how do you call that method?
[12:38:42] <pifantastic> dwarder: s/new date/new Date/
[12:38:51] <ravenzz> ^
[12:39:50] <Zerxer> use firebug/console and monitor for errors
[12:39:53] <Zerxer> life saved

[12:59:19] <TonkaTruck> OH.  Regarding the .ajax() error callback, it *is* actually the jQuery developers who decided to demote the content of badish responses.  It's relegated to XHR, in the back seat, un-parsed.  This is a violation of rfc 2616 if you ask me.  Boo core team.  Present ur case.

[13:02:49] <TonkaTruck> That the content of a bad(ish) server response should not be relegated to xhr.responseText because RFC 2616 indicates, if not explicitly, that the content is just as important as a good(ish) response.

[13:05:10] <ccmonster> i would ask in #jquery-ui , but it's good as dead in there.
[13:05:19] <ajpiano> ccmonster: that's because this is the channel for jquery ui questions
[13:05:28] <ccmonster> got ya
[13:05:41] <ccmonster> well, in that case.. lol
[13:05:45] * ccmonster tears up
[13:05:49] <TonkaTruck> ajpiano: If you really think about it though, that's kind of like saying apache decides the format of a bad(ish) response.
[13:06:05] <ccmonster> bah. not going so well with these events.
[13:06:13] <TonkaTruck> ajpiano: Easy to look at it this way...because we've all been looking at shitty apache error messages for over a decade.
[13:06:42] <ajpiano> that doesn't really help illuminate it for me
[13:06:46] <ajpiano> allz i'm sayin is like
[13:06:52] <ajpiano> dataType: "script"
[13:06:57] <ajpiano> then i get some error and it doesn't return js
[13:07:07] <dwarder> has anyone written custom validator for this plugin http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation?
[13:07:12] <ajpiano> i guess that's not what you're talking about though
[13:07:33] <skamikaze> dwarder: what's the question?
[13:07:38] <ajpiano> you want the actual responseText to just be fed back as an argument to the error callback instead of having to pull it off the xhr?
[13:07:46] <dwarder> can you take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/V2JuP/
[13:08:01] <dwarder> skamikaze: for some reason it doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/V2JuP/
[13:08:35] <TonkaTruck> ajpiano: Keep in mind, the client will still have the status code.  A better way to illuminate it would be to ask yourself why REST clients written in python, ruby, etc...have no issue with this for the simple reason that they treat the content equally.
[13:09:00] <TonkaTruck> 2xx or 4xx, the response is code+content, always.
[13:09:24] <skamikaze> dwarder: i'd use test() instead of match there
[13:09:26] <ajpiano> but it's not like you don't have the content when it's a 4xx...
[13:09:34] <ajpiano> it's just... not an argument to the callback?
[13:09:48] <TonkaTruck> ajpiano: You do have the content, but it's relegated to xhr.responseText, unparsed.
[13:10:03] <skamikaze> dwarder: set a breakpoint, tested your regex yet?
[13:10:16] <TonkaTruck> When it should actually be identical to the arguments to success.
[13:10:26] <TonkaTruck> success(data, textStatus, jqXHR)
[13:10:33] <TonkaTruck> error(data, textStatus, jqXHR)
[13:10:44] <skamikaze> dwarder: http://regexpal.com/ (you could replace \d\d\d\d with \d{e} e.g.)
[13:11:00] <skamikaze> *\d{4}
[13:11:01] <dwarder> skamikaze: same thing without validator http://jsfiddle.net/XuyBr/6/
[13:11:05] <TonkaTruck> That's how it should be.  .ajax()'s position on this matter is only delineating good(ish) v. bad(ish) for the convenience of the developer.
[13:11:33] <TonkaTruck> I mean, that's what the .ajax()'s role *should* be...in my opinion.
[13:11:38] <Hopsy> can I ask something? there is someone sending me a pm, i dont know who it is
[13:11:53] <Hopsy> he or she is asking me to breed a young girl...
[13:11:54] <ajpiano> TonkaTruck: what are you actually proposing be changed?
[13:12:14] <ajpiano> Hopsy: /ignore or go ask for help in #freenode if you are being harassed
[13:12:26] <Hopsy> I will do that
[13:12:55] <dwarder> skamikaze: i don't know why it doesn't work in validator
[13:13:15] <totallyvinny> i have a graph bar that has the percentage filled. is their an easy way to count from 0 to % on load?
[13:13:26] <TonkaTruck> That the arguments of success and error be the same and as such the first argument be "...formatted according to the dataType parameter"
[13:14:03] <skamikaze> dwarder: again, set a breakpoint (does the fn get called)?), test your regex on regexpal
[13:14:03] <ajpiano> i don't think we can plausibly change the arguments fed to error at this point
[13:14:06] <TonkaTruck> ajpiano: I know it's a tall order, and I know the solution is simple...but this is how it should be.
[13:14:33] <dwarder> skamikaze: i gave you exact same code that works
[13:15:01] <dwarder> skamikaze: the only difference is that it is not a validator
[13:15:17] <ajpiano> TonkaTruck: it strikes me as the kind of thing we simply can't change now, but you could accomplish in your app with some of the techniques on http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/
[13:15:51] <Chiel92> How can I prevent an api to be included multiple times? (in html)
[13:16:27] <TonkaTruck> ajpiano: Yeah.  It's too late to change...
[13:19:43] <brettfrable> hey guys

[13:20:15] <brettfrable> ?
[13:29:25] <andrew9183> does anyone know why when i animate the borderColor back to transparent, it leaves it as white?
[13:29:27] <andrew9183> http://andrew.itracmediav5.com/index.html
[13:30:41] <joikus> hi you guys
[13:31:04] <ravenzz> andrew9183 why don't you use css3?
[13:31:12] <joikus> is there a way to build an offline html form page, and when I click save, I store the input data into an xml or json file locally?
[13:31:41] <andrew9183> ravenzz: i would, but some clients are still using ie7
[13:32:52] <iSaleK> Could someone please help me how can I close all open Google Maps InfoBoxes before opening another one?
[13:33:59] <varrg> For elements as <div><div><img></div></div> is the correct syntax: $($(elements[0]).children()[0]).attr('src', 'new_img.png'); <- where elements[0] == outerDiv.children(); ?
[13:34:06] <varrg> I'm reffering to the embedding of $()
[13:34:08] <gnarf> andrew9183: what version of jQuery color are you using?
[13:34:47] <gnarf> and if you aren't using jquery color at all - color based animations are not supported
[13:34:49] <gnarf> ?color
[13:34:49] <bot-t> Color Animations - Adds the ability to do color animations to jQuery. Version 2 is currently in beta: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/31/jquery-color-v2-beta-1-released/ jQuery 1.4+ required - Older versions http://plugins.jquery.com/project/color
[13:35:18] <gnarf> there have been some bugfixes since beta 1
[13:35:33] <gnarf> so i would suggest using the version in git if you want to try the edge
[13:36:12] <gnarf> i also don't believe that the "old" jQuery color supported transparent at all
[13:36:22] <gnarf> you should probably use http://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[13:36:41] <iSaleK> Could someone please help me how can I close all open Google Maps InfoBoxes before opening another one?
[13:37:48] <andrew9183> hmph
[13:43:15] <jirwin> hi everyone
[13:45:11] <jirwin> I'm running into an issue using .live() with change event with this selector: $('.foo').filter(':last'). http://jsfiddle.net/3BQAk/3/ is a simple test case for what I'm doing
[13:45:29] <jirwin> I'm curious if this is a known issue? The issue seems to be with the .filter() call
[13:46:03] <ajpiano> jirwin: yeah you can't use live against *any* chained jquery thing
[13:46:30] <jirwin> oh really? Thats a good pro-tip.
[13:46:38] <jirwin> Thanks for the help :D
[13:46:45] <varrg> For elements as <div><div><img></div></div> is the correct syntax: $($(elements[0]).children()[0]).attr('src', 'new_img.png'); <- where elements[0] == outerDiv.children(); ?
[13:46:46] <varrg> I'm reffering to the embedding of $()
[13:48:04] <ajpiano> good lord no
[13:48:44] <jirwin> heh
[13:49:02] <TonkaTruck> ajpiano: $.ajaxPrefilter() just gave me a boner.  Thanks.
[13:49:04] <ajpiano> $(elements).first().children().first() etc
[13:51:45] <jirwin> ajpiano: will the performance difference between appending ':last' to the selector and using .filter() be a huge deal? There is probably an upper limit of 30 objects in the collection.
[13:52:33] <ajpiano> jirwin: testing for :first tends to not really be the best for live anyway
[13:52:41] <ajpiano> positional selectors in live don't work too well
[13:52:54] <jirwin> yeah, I was curious about that as well.
[13:53:26] <jedimind_> thats why jesus invented .eq()
[13:53:48] <jirwin> .eq() requires me to know how many objects exist though doesn't it?
[13:54:15] <jirwin> just an extra step beyond :last, not a huge deal obviously.
[13:54:26] <jedimind_> doesnt .eq(-1) give you the last one ?
[13:54:42] <jirwin> so it does
[13:54:44] <jirwin> ajpiano++
[13:54:46] <ajpiano> eq() actually has the colleciton, live doesn't have that
[13:54:47] <jirwin> jedimind_++

[13:55:27] <jaequery> hi all, anyone here want to help me with an open source CMS ?
[13:55:39] <varrg> ajpiano, ah okay, and .second() for the second etc?
[13:55:44] <ajpiano> no
[13:55:45] <ajpiano> .eq()
[13:55:52] <ajpiano> .eq(1) etc
[13:56:02] <ajpiano> ther'es only .first() and .last() for convenience
[13:56:04] <ajpiano> it would be absured
[13:56:17] <ajpiano> absurd to have one for everything
[13:56:20] <ajpiano> .fourteenth()
[13:56:21] <ajpiano> lol
[13:56:23] <varrg> ye, agree  ^^
[13:56:31] <varrg> cool
[13:56:43] <varrg> cause embedding it as such, seemed alittle odd to me haha
[13:56:57] <jirwin> varrg: .eq() uses 0-based indexes as a fyi
[14:00:07] <varrg> ye, assumed that much :)
[14:00:40] <ravenzz> andrew9183 also you should add a p:hover so it will still work if your js is broken http://jsfiddle.net/R7hRN/1/
[14:02:49] <ajpiano> TonkaTruck: sweet
[14:03:59] <daleharvey> does anyone know how to make jquery not send */* as an accept header?

[14:11:42] <ProLoser|Work> http://turntable.fm/freenode
[14:13:23] <bboyrman> hey guys. document.getElementsByTagName returns a live nodeList. jQuery uses document.querySelectorAll, which isn't a live node List. Is there a way to have a jQuery object with the list of nodes being live?
[14:13:38] <ajpiano> nope
[14:14:11] <bboyrman> that sucks :P
[14:14:48] <bboyrman> can a jquery plugin do it? I don't think so :/
[14:15:27] <TonkaTruck> ProLoser|Work: I'm surprised there aren't more people in your freenode room.
[14:15:42] <TonkaTruck> I've been in "indie while you work" for the past 8 hours haha.
[14:16:58] <andrew9183> hey, thanks raven
[14:17:35] <context> whats a live node list
[14:17:49] <context> err, whats the difference :/
[14:17:55] <bboyrman> it's list that updates if something changes in it
[14:18:13] <bboyrman> like aes = document.getElementsByTagName('a')
[14:18:21] <bboyrman> will always contain all the a's in the document
[14:18:29] <devc> crazy, I didn't know that.
[14:18:49] <bboyrman> and if a's are added and removed, the list will update and the var aes will change to represent the current document
[14:20:36] <ProLoser|Work> TonkaTruck: we don't get any random people dropping in unfortunately
[14:20:40] <ProLoser|Work> it's sort of dissappointing
[14:21:15] <TonkaTruck> The problem is probably in shared tastes.  For instance, I would never listen to deftones haha.
[14:21:22] <ProLoser|Work> me neither
[14:21:31] <ProLoser|Work> but axel likes the metal shit lol
[14:21:38] <TonkaTruck> Haha I can dig it.
[14:21:47] <ProLoser|Work> honestly id on't mind some variety, 1 out of 4 (or even 5) isn't bad
[14:21:57] <intellilogic> $(this).next('select') which works for me until I try to add labels to my select boxes, how can I work around this?
[14:21:57] <ProLoser|Work> plus with more people we can ask to keep it to the mood
[14:22:02] <ProLoser|Work> and he's happy to play whatev er you pref

[15:21:34] <necromancer> muhdick: no, jquery threw up all over the prom so he's not popular anymore

[15:45:07] <thebignoise> what is the proper syntax for delaying a custom function custFunc().delay(1000) doesnt work and neither does $.delay(1000, "custFunc")
[15:45:16] <ajpiano> ?delay2 @ thebignoise
[15:45:16] <bot-t> thebignoise, .delay() is best for delaying between queued jQuery effects and such, and is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function, which may be more appropriate for certain use cases. (from api.jquery.com/delay/ )
[15:45:26] <thebignoise> ajpiano: i looked
[15:45:30] <thebignoise> didnt see anything
[15:45:36] <ajpiano> setTimeout( somefn, 100 );
[15:46:36] <thebignoise> ajpiano: oh so delay isn't even the right choice anyways
[15:46:37] <thebignoise> thank you

[16:01:21] <ajpiano> $.get("foo.php", function(data) { doStuff(); $(document).trigger("foo");   }); and then on the one page only $(document).bind("foo", fn);
[16:01:25] <ajpiano> pretty much]
[16:02:38] <TonkaTruck> ajpiano: If I were these butter people I'd turn this into something zencoder would want to buy...is what I mean.
[16:03:48] <ajpiano> TonkaTruck: yea i have also heard that Mozilla is really into building companies so they can be acquired
[16:03:49] <ajpiano> :x
[16:04:13] <devaholic> https://github.com/tblobaum/nodeQuery
[16:04:54] <devaholic> check i
[16:04:55] <devaholic> it
[16:05:10] <ajpiano> that is pretty cool
[16:08:26] <devaholic> one page todos app https://github.com/tblobaum/nodeQuery/blob/master/examples/todos.js
[16:08:52] <devaholic> uses backbone like mvc conventions
[16:09:19] <devaholic> (to build an app with nodequery)
[16:18:09] <thebignoise> how do i pass var: data to .complete
[16:18:36] <thebignoise> in an ajax request
[16:18:54] <sputnick> hi there
[16:19:02] <bakers> thebignoise: You want do pass data to the complete method?
[16:19:08] <thebignoise> bakers: yes
[16:19:48] <bakers> thebignoise: You... can't? You could use a global variable
[16:20:05] <thebignoise> crap didnt think so.
[16:20:07] <thebignoise> lol thankx
[16:20:09] <bakers> thebignoise: or you can fetch the data from inside the complete function
[16:20:23] <bakers> I'd be inclined to get all the data you need with a fetch inside complete
[16:20:29] <bakers> or success()
[16:20:39] <thebignoise> bakers: yea im trying success right now
[16:20:51] <bakers> you can't pass to sucess either
[16:21:28] <sputnick> I would like to select an "option" in a "select" said "qux", I tried "$('.foo').val('qux')" but with no luck. What's wrong ? http://stardust.hd.free.fr:2011/q.html
[16:23:02] <captainramen> ajpiano: that worked, thanks!
[16:23:05] <sputnick> or http://pastie.org/2770473
[16:23:42] <BinaryKitten> sputnick
[16:23:48] <sputnick> yes ?
[16:23:50] <bjoern__> <select name="foo" size="1" tabindex="1"> needs to be <select class="foo" name="foo" size="1" tabindex="1">
[16:23:50] <BinaryKitten> where is the foo class?
[16:24:03] <LakWork_> is there any easy way to see where a particular event binding happened?
[16:26:22] <sputnick> BinaryKitten: refresh the page please, this is my "real life" example, the class is upper http://stardust.hd.free.fr:2011/q.html
[16:26:59] <BinaryKitten> again sputnick where is the class
[16:27:07] <sputnick> BinaryKitten: I would like to select the very first option
[16:27:19] <BinaryKitten> .foo means find me all the items that have the  class foo
[16:27:38] <BinaryKitten> the select doesn't have a class or id to hook on
[16:27:54] <sputnick> BinaryKitten: the class is upper as I said, it's a real sample from real web. The select *have no class* so maybe JQuery is not an option !?
[16:28:16] <BinaryKitten> it is and can be
[16:28:21] <sputnick> nice
[16:28:27] <BinaryKitten> if the there is no class then switch the selector
[16:29:03] <BinaryKitten> eg $('select[name=DS]')
[16:29:10] <bjoern__> try $('[name=foo]').val('qux')
[16:29:47] <bjoern__> yes or better $('select[name=foo]').val('qux') both will work
[16:30:29] <sputnick> bjoern__: the first gives me "TypeError: Cannot call method 'val' of null"
[16:31:01] <sputnick> both bjoern__
[16:31:26] <BinaryKitten> or even var $item = $('select[name=foo]'); $item.val($item.find('option').eq(0).attr('value'));
[16:32:12] <agush> hi!
[16:32:29] <sputnick> bytecraft: "TypeError: Cannot call method 'find' of null"
[16:32:33] <Mage3> BinaryKitten: is there a particular reason why you do $item and not item?
[16:32:40] <bjoern__> you probably need to put your code in the $.document ready
[16:32:57] <BinaryKitten> Mage3 mainly to denote it's a jquery object
[16:33:03] <Mage3> neat idea
[16:33:03] <BinaryKitten> jsut personal pref
[16:33:04] <bjoern__> try $(function(){  $('select[name=foo]') }
[16:34:29] <agush> hi, i have a doubt about load();
[16:34:38] <BinaryKitten> about which load()
[16:34:56] <agush> the one that is shorthand for ajax
[16:35:03] <BinaryKitten> ok
[16:35:23] <BinaryKitten> what are your doubts?
[16:35:30] <kvnn> I want jquery mobile methods but I don't want it to do anything on page load "mobileinit". Is that acceptable? (jquerymobile is dead. I'll only answer once)
[16:35:43] <agush> if I have say a div #test with images and a slider and what not
[16:35:43] <kvnn> *ask once
[16:35:47] <sputnick> I tried : "$(function(){  var $item = $('select[name="DS"]'); $item.val($item.find('option').eq(0).attr('value')); })" : return null and the select is stille the last one
[16:35:59] <agush> and i use load() to replace the contents of #test
[16:36:13] <agush> do i have to worry about the previous contents
[16:36:37] <agush> or do those resources get released after i replace the content
[16:36:48] <sputnick> same thing with $(function(){  $('select[name="DS"]').val('20110913') ;})
[16:37:14] <BinaryKitten> urm sputnick
[16:37:25] <BinaryKitten> on you page, you have linked in jquery right?
[16:37:58] <sputnick> BinaryKitten: doh............ sorry
[16:38:06] * sputnick tired :/
[16:38:26] <BinaryKitten> no worries
[16:39:00] <agush> :)
[16:39:24] <BinaryKitten> the one with the .eq(0) will always select the 1st item
[16:39:28] <Tobsn> is someone here building user scripts?
[16:39:28] <BinaryKitten> no matter what it is
[16:39:34] <BinaryKitten> Tobsn?
[16:39:42] <BinaryKitten> ?ask @ Tobsn
[16:39:42] <bot-t> Tobsn, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:39:46] <sputnick> BinaryKitten: nice, that's what I'm looking for
[16:39:48] <Tobsn> gimme a second
[16:39:49] <Tobsn> im writing
[16:39:50] <Tobsn> jesus
[16:39:58] <BinaryKitten> he can't help
[16:40:00] <BinaryKitten> :p
[16:40:03] <Tobsn> ...
[16:40:03] <joikus> guys I need a cool solution for um
[16:40:19] <agush> haha :p
[16:40:25] <joikus> I need to put an 'app' in a usb key, when you open it, there's an input form, when you click save, I store it in the usb key :(
[16:40:39] <BinaryKitten> urm in JS?
[16:40:43] <coldhead> jesus can sometiems help of your comments are in aramaic
[16:40:49] <Tobsn> im loading javascript into facebook - im writing it right after the <head><script src="myremotescript"></script> but when you click somewhere like into someones profile - the script stops working
[16:40:49] <coldhead> if*
[16:40:51] <coldhead> sometimes*
[16:40:52] <coldhead> jesus
[16:40:53] <bjoern__> hehe sputnik look here http://jsfiddle.net/fiddlebjoern/zYFnn/
[16:41:07] <joikus> BinaryKitten, I was hoping to use an html form to draw the gui
[16:41:08] <Tobsn> like a simple setInterval that console.logs a tick every second will stop working
[16:41:21] <BinaryKitten> Tobsn sorry can't help you there, that's a facebook issue most likely
[16:41:22] <Tobsn> but i can see that the script src is still inside the page
[16:41:25] <coldhead> joikus: i don't like your chances
[16:41:29] <Tobsn> well it is javascript
[16:41:38] <BinaryKitten> do you get teh same result on a blank page?
[16:41:54] <joikus> coldhead, what do you suggest?
[16:41:56] <sputnick> thanks "$('[name=DS]').val('20110913')" works as a charm
[16:42:02] <BinaryKitten> joikus unfortunately file paths are not saveable from a web browser directly
[16:42:03] <Tobsn> it has to do with the bigpipe system they use... seems like it unsets everything thats inside the page
[16:42:04] <joikus> theyd like it to work on cross browser/OS
[16:42:15] <BinaryKitten> sputnick that's extremely limited
[16:42:25] <agush> so can anyone help me on that load(); question? pretty please
[16:42:26] <Tobsn> i just need to find out how they change the url without reloading the whole page
[16:42:30] <Tobsn> and its not a hash change
[16:42:46] <BinaryKitten> angush what's the q?
[16:43:01] <joikus> silverlight/flash requires the installer/plugin to be shipped in the usb
[16:43:08] <joikus> im so confused on how to do this
[16:43:16] <agush> its because im using load(), to load different jquery image sliders on this #test div
[16:43:17] <coldhead> joikus: i don't think there's any cross browser way to save form data to an arbitrary file on a usb
[16:43:37] <BinaryKitten> Tobsn you're going to have to find a Facebook help channel, it's not really a jquery issue that you're having
[16:43:38] <joikus> am I stuck using Java or silverlight/flash ?
[16:43:38] <agush> should i release the previous contents, or am i ok just loading each new slider
[16:43:43] <bjoern__> Tobsn, thats only possible with push state, with isn't supported be old brwosres
[16:43:44] <Tobsn> omg...
[16:43:51] <Tobsn> no, youre just not understanding the question
[16:43:52] <coldhead> at best you could maybe prompt them to save a file to that location as a download
[16:43:56] <BinaryKitten> joikus look at titanium
[16:44:03] <coldhead> and hope they do
[16:44:06] <Tobsn> bjoern__, how is that triggered?
[16:44:10] <BinaryKitten> you can use jquery etc there
[16:44:20] <joikus> titanium?
[16:44:27] <Tobsn> joikus, dont look at titanium, it blows
[16:44:28] <BinaryKitten> Titanium desktop yes
[16:44:44] <BinaryKitten> Tobsn it meets his requirements
[16:44:53] <agush> ??
[16:45:13] <bjoern__> tobsn â€¦ look here https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history there its says Suppose http://mozilla.org/foo.html executes the following JavaScript:
[16:45:13] <bjoern__> var stateObj = { foo: "bar" };
[16:45:13] <bjoern__> history.pushState(stateObj, "page 2", "bar.html");
[16:45:24] <Tobsn> ah i see
[16:45:33] <bjoern__> This will cause the URL bar to display http://mozilla.org/bar.html, but won't cause the browser to load bar.html or even check that bar.html exists
[16:45:35] <Tobsn> any ideas why that would "deactive" injected scripts?
[16:46:41] <agush> anyone knows?
[16:46:49] <coldhead> joikus: what do you need this for anyway? it sounds like something from a william gibson novel
[16:46:49] <agush> i know js has garbage collection
[16:47:13] <agush> but i dont want to bug it down after loading X number of sliders
[16:47:22] <BinaryKitten> agush the issue is that you will need to rebind the slider
[16:48:13] <BinaryKitten> replacing the content should be fine, but once they are replaced it will have the issue that the content is not the same, so the slider will no longer function
[16:48:40] <joikus> coldhead: requirements are as follows: Users have usb-bracelets, when they input in their PC/Mac, the app launches, could be offline website, or some installer .. then a form opens up - they input some medical data and click save.
[16:48:52] <agush> ah no its ok
[16:48:56] <joikus> the idea is, if they get into an accident, someone else can put their usb in pc and view the data
[16:49:01] <joikus> trying to find the best way to do this
[16:49:02] <agush> each slider has different images
[16:49:17] <coldhead> medical data! awesome
[16:49:19] <agush> i just dont want past sliders running in the background
[16:49:30] <joikus> basic information though, like blood type etc
[16:49:37] <coldhead> i couldn't be more satisfied with that answer
[16:49:51] <joikus> what do you mean?
[16:50:10] <agush> you can check it out, on www.impactovisualmovil.com.mx/rocanuevo, on the portfolio section
[16:50:39] <agush> i mean www.impactovisualmovil.com.mx/rocabueno
[16:50:54] <coldhead> you're working on a cool project, joikus
[16:50:57] <coldhead> i am envious
[16:51:15] <joikus> ok not sure if you're sarcastic eheh
[16:52:19] <coldhead> i am sincere
[16:52:21] <coldhead> for once
[16:52:22] <coldhead> :)
[16:52:25] <joikus> hehe
[16:52:33] <joikus> I wanted to avoid the 'winform' approach
[16:52:37] <joikus> I hate java/c# winforms
[16:52:57] <OomElvis> +1
[16:53:11] <abjorn> C# winforms aren't that bad, at least they don't look as fucking god awful as java's widgatz
[16:53:19] <joikus> i know but it wont work on mac/linux
[16:53:24] <agush> the thing is they need the framework
[16:53:24] <abjorn> psh
[16:53:26] <abjorn> mac
[16:53:30] <abjorn> also that's not true
[16:53:35] <abjorn> mono, bro
[16:53:35] <agush> no?
[16:53:47] <joikus> how do you deploy this from a usb
[16:53:52] <abjorn> mono supports winforms
[16:54:04] <joikus> its not straight forward, mono isnt up to date with .NET 4.0 afaik, not sure not familair with mono though
[16:54:12] <abjorn> actually for the most part it is
[16:54:17] <abjorn> there are a few things that aren't perfect
[16:54:24] <abjorn> but for most cases you can straight port to mono
[16:54:25] <agush> yeah but the user has to have it installed in the first place no?
[16:54:31] <abjorn> yeah but
[16:54:32] <joikus> ya
[16:54:33] <abjorn> ..it's linux
[16:54:37] <abjorn> you gotta install shit anyways
[16:54:47] <abjorn> idk if mono works on mac
[16:54:49] <abjorn> probably
[16:54:52] <joikus> actually not worried about linux
[16:54:56] <abjorn> psh
[16:54:57] <abjorn> YOU SHOULD BE
[16:55:02] <agush> !!
[16:55:02] <abjorn> all you mac hipsters
[16:55:04] <abjorn> with your toshes
[16:55:06] <agush> hahaha
[16:55:07] <joikus> i doubt these users have linux
[16:55:11] <abjorn> well
[16:55:12] <abjorn> they should
[16:55:17] <joikus> why ?
[16:55:21] <agush> they should install gentoo
[16:55:23] <agush> all of them
[16:55:24] <abjorn> no
[16:55:30] <abjorn> no they should install debian <3
[16:55:43] <abjorn> linux - made easy <3
[16:55:47] <joikus> i love linux, but it's dead in the consumer world
[16:55:53] <joikus> and I could care less for it
[16:56:01] <abjorn> tell that to...everyone i work with
[16:56:07] <abjorn> all our jobs revolve around linux
[16:56:08] <abjorn> lol
[16:56:09] <joikus> IT nerds like us care for linus
[16:56:17] <abjorn> no, the WEB revolved around linux
[16:56:19] <joikus> my sister or your father don't care
[16:56:27] <coldhead> android will carry the linux torch everywhere
[16:56:38] <joikus> ya it will
[16:56:39] <agush> lol
[16:56:57] <abjorn> a large...LARGE majority of servers are linux
[16:57:05] <abjorn> most of the ones that aren't, are bsd
[16:57:08] <joikus> installing Titanium Desktop
[16:57:10] <joikus> I feel like a bum
[16:57:13] <abjorn> lol
[16:57:15] <abjorn> titanium is nice
[16:57:30] <agush> ok so it seems binarykitten is gone can anyone help me? on this little question about load();
[16:57:30] <joikus> when I build my app, what does the executable look like lol
[16:58:07] <BinaryKitten> like however you want it to
[16:58:21] * BinaryKitten is flittling about getting ready for bed
[16:58:28] <BinaryKitten> sorry agush i can;t be of more help
[16:58:36] <joikus> ok thx BK
[16:59:19] <agush> BinnaryKitten ah ok haha  just tell me a yes or a no
[16:59:31] <agush> is stuff inside a replaced div still on the background
[16:59:42] <agush> or is it gone after replaced? with load()
[17:00:04] <BinaryKitten> gone
[17:00:11] <coldhead> i heard BSD is dying
[17:00:12] <BinaryKitten> like using .html
[17:00:15] <coldhead> and netcraft confirmed it
[17:01:54] <agush> ok thanks!
[17:01:59] <sputnick> BinaryKitten: "var $item = $('select[name="DS"]'); $item.val($item.find('option').eq(0).attr('value'))" works well on my test page, but in real world in chrome javascript console that return "undefined" and no change. "$().jquery;" return 1.3.2 and this is tested well with this version in my test page
[17:02:01] <agush> have a good night guys!
[17:02:21] <joikus> BinaryKitten, quick question, using Titanium Desktop, with html, how can I save data to disk?
[17:02:25] <joikus> using jquery
[17:02:35] <BinaryKitten> joikus in theory
[17:02:36] <abjorn> http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/299544_222700381131277_217514361649879_624061_904264844_n.jpg
[17:02:36] <abjorn> This puts a certain NWA song in my head
[17:02:47] <BinaryKitten> you will need to read the titanium api
[17:03:06] <joikus> ok
[17:03:17] <abjorn> coldhead: it is because it makes all linux distros look super easy to install
[17:03:31] <sputnick> BinaryKitten: I don't even know any clue why that doesn't work
[17:03:32] <coldhead> shutup gentoo boy
[17:03:35] <BinaryKitten> undefined is not a bad thing ther sputnick
[17:03:42] <BinaryKitten> it doesn't mean it didn't work
[17:03:56] <sputnick> yes but the select is not changed
[17:04:01] <BinaryKitten> sputnick if we can see the live html then we can help
[17:04:08] <abjorn> coldhead: no u
[17:04:09] <BinaryKitten> try using jsfiddle
[17:04:37] <sputnick> thanks BinaryKitten but that's not public
[17:05:15] <BinaryKitten> sputnick take it a step back
[17:05:22] <BinaryKitten> console.log($item);
[17:05:29] <BinaryKitten> right after $item is set
[17:05:36] <BinaryKitten> see what you get
[17:07:57] <bn_> does anyone have any ideas why JS/jq barfs when it encounters the following var declarations in http://jsfiddle.net/4aNZp/ ?
[17:08:31] <bn_> specifically it seems to not like the multiple string concatenation
[17:08:35] <BinaryKitten> bn_ i think you're leaving out some scope there
[17:08:51] <bn_> BinaryKitten: ?
[17:09:14] <BinaryKitten> where is that code running? because $(this) as it stands equates to $(window)
[17:09:53] <bn_> BinaryKitten: it's within a jq event handler.  also, is there a line length limit for concats?
[17:10:29] <bn_> BinaryKitten:  ie:  "$(".share-bar li.join").click(function (e) {" .... "});"
[17:10:47] <BinaryKitten> ok bn_ thanks
[17:11:19] <BinaryKitten> bn_ check $pod
[17:11:29] <BinaryKitten> make sure it's retuning what you expect
[17:11:57] <BinaryKitten> personally i prefer array join over lots of concatenation
[17:12:00] <joikus> Titanium.Filesystem.Filestream.write
[17:12:08] <BinaryKitten> joikus yay!
[17:12:35] <joikus> looking for examples now lol
[17:12:36] <sputnick> ok BinaryKitten, I test that
[17:12:40] <bn_> BinaryKitten: I don't think it's that because if I comment out the other var declarations, JSLint passes.  There is something syntactically wrong with the subsequent ones that is throwing off the syntax parser
[17:13:14] <bn_> BinaryKitten: or is it illegal to do concats in a var declaration?
[17:13:22] <BinaryKitten> I didn't say it was that though and no it's not
[17:13:30] <BinaryKitten> i was just stating my prefs
[17:14:00] <sputnick> BinaryKitten: "console.log($item)" return "[]; undefined"
[17:14:34] <bn_> BinaryKitten: yeah, if I comment in each line one by one JSLint passes till it gets to the last line.... I wonder if it's the "/" s?
[17:14:36] <BinaryKitten> I can't help much because of lack of more information. bn_ can you update the fiddle with html and the bind statement?
[17:14:56] <BinaryKitten> sputnick right so it's not finding the select
[17:15:03] <BinaryKitten> that's the []
[17:15:27] <BinaryKitten> since console.log doesn't return anything, the console outputs undefined
[17:16:07] <BinaryKitten> bn_
[17:16:16] <BinaryKitten> / is an escape char
[17:16:20] <sputnick> BinaryKitten: is it possible that a site can avoid DOM manipulation by any way ? I mean they probably force to select "options" by humans, dunno if it's possible
[17:16:21] <BinaryKitten> so escape it
[17:16:44] <BinaryKitten> sputnick have no clue sorry
[17:16:48] <bn_> BinaryKitten:  I thought "\" is the escape char?
[17:16:51] <BinaryKitten> i got lost in the question
[17:16:59] <BinaryKitten> urm.. possibly ?
[17:17:05] * BinaryKitten is clutching at straws
[17:17:36] <bn_> BinaryKitten: but it's possible "/" is a special char that needs escaping... but there is other code here that does concats with "/" fine ... :/
[17:17:51] <BinaryKitten> the only issues i can see with the code you've presented bn_ is the possibility of the $pod not being what you expect
[17:18:08] <BinaryKitten> since that itself is relied on in the concat
[17:18:17] <bn_> BinaryKitten: I can take out the $pod stuff and JSLint still will complain, it's something else...
[17:18:27] <BinaryKitten> JSLint?
[17:18:30] <BinaryKitten> does it run?
[17:18:32] <bn_> BinaryKitten:  again, this is a syntax issue
[17:18:38] <sputnick> BinaryKitten: I have a clue, there's some frames, maybe the console is not in the right one
[17:18:57] <BinaryKitten> sputnick yes, the code has to be in the same frame
[17:19:00] <bn_> BinaryKitten:  of course it does, if I comment out the last var declaration :)
[17:19:01] <BinaryKitten> otherwise it can't see it
[17:19:22] <bn_> BinaryKitten: actually it runs fine in all situations, it's just that with the last var declaration it complains, try clicking on in the JSFiddle
[17:19:48] <BinaryKitten> bn_ which js fiddle?
[17:20:14] <sputnick> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/539504/run-jquery-in-the-context-of-another-frame :)
[17:20:14] <bn_> BinaryKitten: in the JSFiddle link I posted earlier there should be a button that says "JSLint"
[17:22:12] <bn_> ugh, I see my mistake
[17:22:54] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/4aNZp/1/ validates
[17:23:34] <BinaryKitten> also what are you posting to the uri?
[17:23:55] <bn_> BinaryKitten: I figured out my issue, don't worry about it, thanks :)
[17:24:12] <BinaryKitten> because if you're not posting anything to it, then you might as well use get to cut the processing overhead
[17:24:17] <BinaryKitten> bn_ what wa he issue?
[17:26:02] <takahiro> hi, im trying to customize jquery.fn.rte (rich text plugin) but the source code looks like greek to me - basically im trying to create a rich-text edit box that converts "*text*" to the bolded version "*text*" while editing, but when i submit (save) it strips out all the html and only stores *text*
[17:26:20] <bn_> BinaryKitten:  well, it's AJAX so they're usually POSTs but that's a good point.  It was a missing concat operator, I know dumb, lol
[17:26:38] <BinaryKitten> ajax != post :)
[17:26:40] <takahiro> anyone have any tips on how i should proceeed with my customization? what sort of things i should learn first, or maybe look at in particular?
[17:26:46] <BinaryKitten> cool catch though
[17:27:15] <BinaryKitten> takahiro check the unminified versions 1st
[17:28:21] <takahiro> yep, downloaded those already... been studying how the plugin works
[17:29:28] <sputnick> BinaryKitten: is it looking good ? "var $item = $('select[name=DS]', window.parent.frames[1].document); $item.val($item.find('option').eq(0).attr('value')) "
[17:31:00] <BinaryKitten> no sputnick
[17:31:12] <BinaryKitten> put the js in the same document as the item you want
[17:31:13] <coldhead> hell no
[17:31:21] <BinaryKitten> cross frame scripting = bad
[17:31:28] <BinaryKitten> and won't work reliably
[17:32:02] <BinaryKitten> if you can, get rid of the frames. they are old old tech and frowned upon heavily
[17:32:10] <BinaryKitten> (especially by those like coldhead)
[17:32:32] <BinaryKitten> (I can head coldhead frown and it's his 1st day with jquery)
[17:32:34] <coldhead> oh don't get me started
[17:32:36] <sputnick> no, I do some screen-scraping, I can only take it 'as-is" BinaryKitten
[17:32:55] <BinaryKitten> sputnick can't help you much more then
[17:32:56] <BinaryKitten> sorry
[17:33:01] <coldhead> frames make my internal organs hemorrhage
[17:35:25] <sputnick> BinaryKitten: I have a clue, I just have to load the frame and not the whole page ^^
[17:35:37] <sputnick> obvious
[17:36:27] <giotti_> Hi everyone, is there any way to capture a mouseup event between table-cells? I've added click-drag-select functionality to a table, but if I let go of the mouse between cells, nothing happens. I've tried adding a mouseup to the tbody, but alas, this failed to fix it.. Anyone any ideas?
[17:36:37] <BinaryKitten> rght well i don't know about anyone else
[17:36:49] <BinaryKitten> but 1:35am seeems like a good time to try to sleep
[17:48:18] <xsznix_> using .keypress() how do i cancel a keypress event
[17:49:15] <xsznix_> is anyone there?
[17:49:41] <kborchers> ?preventDefault @ xsznix_
[17:49:41] <bot-t> xsznix_, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[17:49:50] <xsznix_> ok thanks
[18:02:29] <mfilipe> how do I do to redirect the browser through jquery?
[18:04:25] <coldhead> window.location.href = 'something';
[18:05:37] <mfilipe> coldhead, is this cross-browser?
[18:05:54] <track> anyone think this is a good idea? http://c.ui.ly/bit/map
[18:05:58] <kborchers> wow
[18:06:15] <coldhead> it works across browsers that support javascript

[18:32:08] <patrick99e99> What is the opposite of ".not()"  ?
[18:32:18] <Mage3> .not.not
[18:32:37] <patrick99e99> like if I have images = $('#blah').find('img')
[18:32:51] <patrick99e99> so I do something to that collection of images
[18:33:09] <patrick99e99> but then after that, I want to refine it and just get image where [alt=foo]
[18:33:23] <patrick99e99> whats the best way to do that?
[18:35:08] <THEtheChad> patrick99e99: you would just do images.find('[alt=foo]');
[18:36:02] <THEtheChad> patrick99e99: it will take your collection of images and return anything with alt=foo
[18:36:45] <THEtheChad> patrick99e99: you can use find as many times as you like $all_anchors = $(document).find('div').find('p').find('a')
[18:37:02] <patrick99e99> THEtheChad: Hmm.. I tried that and it doesnt seem to work...
[18:37:14] <patrick99e99> If I do blah.parent().find('img')  I get 3 images
[18:37:26] <patrick99e99> If I do blah.parent().find('img[type=foo]')  I get 1 image
[18:37:35] <patrick99e99> oops sorry
[18:37:37] <patrick99e99> i meant alt not type
[18:37:56] <patrick99e99> If I do blah.parent().find('img').find('[alt=foo]')
[18:37:57] <patrick99e99> I get []
[18:38:38] <THEtheChad>  blah.parent().find('img').find('[alt="foo"]')
[18:38:50] <THEtheChad> patrick99e99: Put foo in quotes
[18:39:15] <patrick99e99> THEtheChad: same thing.. no good...
[18:39:30] <patrick99e99> and doing find('img[alt=foo]') without quotes shows the image
[18:39:44] <patrick99e99> its just when i chain the find it doesn't.. which I suspect because find is looking inside nested elements
[18:39:49] <patrick99e99> maybe i want .siblings?
[18:39:57] <MsDani> how do I do this -> http://jsfiddle.net/EuhRf/
[18:40:10] <MsDani> basically i want the click() to use the id from the array
[18:40:25] <MsDani> but if i do it like it is now it only uses the last id for all of them
[18:40:29] <patrick99e99> no siblings is not the answer..... hmmm
[18:41:11] <patrick99e99> If I do blah.parent().find('img').not('[alt=bar]') then I get the foo image
[18:41:21] <patrick99e99> so its like I need the opposite of .not
[18:42:02] <patrick99e99> If I do blah.parent().find('img').parent().find('[alt=foo]')  then this works
[18:42:07] <patrick99e99> but it seems silly to have to call parent twice
[18:42:14] <giotti_> patrick99e99: you could each() and then manually compare the alt-tag in a function
[18:43:53] <THEtheChad> patrick99e99: I think it may be looking at the children only, writing up a fiddle now
[18:44:06] <giotti_> now someone tell me, why I can't get mouse-events in between table cells, unless i wrap the sucker in a div, which doesn't let me exclude elements from the table from the event
[18:44:23] <giotti_> elements of the table
[18:44:53] <rmurphey> patrick99e99: i haven't been following along, but perhaps you want .is() ?
[18:44:56] <rmurphey> http://api.jquery.com/is/
[18:45:59] <rmurphey> or http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[18:46:15] <rmurphey> patrick99e99: probably the latter
[18:46:46] <THEtheChad> patrick99e99: rmurphey: It's the latter, r.
[18:47:35] <rmurphey> he said opposite of .not() so i went with .is() but then i read further back :)
[18:48:42] <THEtheChad> Looks like is doesn't return or alter the collection.
[18:49:04] <rmurphey> nope, just returns true/false
[18:49:10] <THEtheChad> rmurphey: Do you know anything about the jQuery Event object?
[18:49:35] <rmurphey> probably not what you need to know :)
[18:50:03] <THEtheChad> rmurphey: Well if you find anyone that knows how to create a custom event and override the target property, let me know ;-)
[18:54:26] <snover> THEtheChad: new jQuery.Eventâ€¦
[18:55:27] <THEtheChad> snover: Tried it ... new jQuery.Event('click', {target: OVERRIDE}) doesn't work =/
[18:57:00] <snover> sure it does.
[18:57:08] <snover> http://jsfiddle.net/hrhRy/
[18:59:24] <THEtheChad> snover: I wonder if that's because you didn't create an instance of it?
[19:00:04] <snover> THEtheChad: that is an instance of it.
[19:00:20] <snover> read the first line of the jQuery.Event function.
[19:02:53] <THEtheChad> I see
[19:03:36] <THEtheChad> snover: Problem is, you didn't trigger the event. When triggering the event, I believe the target gets modified by the DOM element publishing the event.
[19:03:53] <THEtheChad> I'm trying to modify your fiddle to demonstrate.
[19:03:55] <snover> THEtheChad: what excatly is it you are trying to do?
[19:04:04] <snover> and please donâ€™t say â€œchange the target on an eventâ€
[19:04:22] <THEtheChad> I'm publishing global events using $.event.trigger()
[19:04:39] <THEtheChad> The issue I'm having is that delegate doesn't work when publishing this way
[19:04:58] <THEtheChad> I'm assuming it's verifying the 'target' to identify when to run the handler
[19:05:19] <THEtheChad> The target is going to be the document everytime with $.event.trigger()
[19:05:39] <snover> global events? you are recreating pubsub?
[19:05:54] <THEtheChad> Maybe ... I have no idea what pubsub is
[19:06:13] <snover> time to do a little reading then. :)
[19:07:58] <THEtheChad> snover: Found a post. Thanks!
[19:47:24] <giotti_> night
[19:53:52] <frewsxcv> so i need to append <li>some data here</li> to a <ul> element. is there any benefit to using createElement than just doing "<ul>" + data + "</ul>"
[19:53:58] <frewsxcv> *<li>
[19:54:15] <eddiemonge> not really
[19:57:14] <frewsxcv> there's no 'jquery' way to create elements i should be using?
[20:00:45] <eddiemonge> frewsxcv: .append('htmlstring') .html('htmlstring') - so no not really
[20:04:14] <darcyclarke> eddiemonge why you hang out here and no ot?
[20:04:42] <eddiemonge> darcyclarke: im not allowed in :(
[20:04:46] <darcyclarke> haha
[20:04:56] <darcyclarke> so... about that api
[20:04:57] <darcyclarke> :P
[20:05:02] <OomElvis> Q: im iterating through a bunch of <select>s with the same class name: "$('select.destination_field').each(function() {" ...... how would i set the selected item for the current <select>?
[20:05:15] <darcyclarke> would be sweet if you could just add like a new feed to it etc.
[20:05:18] <eddiemonge> OomElvis: this
[20:05:21] <darcyclarke> maybe even pull in js jobs
[20:05:23] <darcyclarke> oooo
[20:05:28] <darcyclarke> all in one jquery api
[20:05:30] <darcyclarke> :)
[20:06:03] <OomElvis> eddiemonge: i knew the "this" part, but dont know how to piece it together with stuff like "option"
[20:07:32] <eddiemonge> OomElvis: what are you trying to do? what have you done? jsfiddle some code with how you think it would work or how it would work in english speak
[20:08:32] <OomElvis> well, its like this: i have an array with two values: 2 and 3. i have two select with a whole bunch of values, including 2 and 3. so for each select , if i come across 2 or 3, then the matching <option> should be selected
[20:09:18] <eddiemonge> what if there is a 2 and a 3?
[20:09:43] <OomElvis> then <select>2</select> or <select>3</select> should be set as selected
[20:09:51] <OomElvis> whichever is found first
[20:12:20] <eddiemonge> $(this).find('option[value="2"]').prop('selected', 'selected')
[20:14:48] <OomElvis> "#<Object> has no method 'prop'"
[20:14:52] <OomElvis> o_O
[20:15:20] <OomElvis> i think this worked: $(this).find('option[value="2"]').attr('selected', true)
[20:15:44] <OomElvis> yeh
[20:15:47] <OomElvis> cool, thanks man (:
[20:16:13] <OomElvis> jquery is like voodoo
[20:17:48] <eddiemonge> OomElvis: what version of jq are you using?
[20:18:15] <OomElvis> 1.4.4
[20:19:02] <fris> prop didnt come in until 1.6
[20:20:14] <OomElvis> o ok cool
[20:20:32] <eddiemonge> OomElvis: why not upgrade?
[20:20:47] <OomElvis> ye, proly wil
[20:23:08] <fris> OomElvis or do something along these lines check for it http://pastebin.com/avuXMzbM
[20:25:32] <eddiemonge> fris: what is all that for?
[20:30:26] <fris> just checks for the jq version, the other stuff is my code was just showing an example
[20:31:24] <eddiemonge> you check for the jq version?
[20:31:54] <eddiemonge> fris: http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/02/how-to-check-jquery-version.html
[20:32:13] <fris> ya better way :p
[20:32:48] <fris> or just stick to attr instead of prop
[20:33:33] <eddiemonge> attr doesnt work well for things like selected that change
[20:34:10] <smsfail> I have these two scripts, they work perfectly independently of each other but when I have them like this, the autocomplete works fine, but the validation just flashes then the form submits. . . ? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/499370/
[20:34:47] <Prot> so...  lets say i want to build an ajax request. I don't know the url or what it looks like, and I need to send both get and post data
[20:35:01] <Prot> do I have to write my own function to see if the url contains a '?' or not?
[20:35:08] <Prot> or is there any jquery to handle url building
[20:35:51] <eddiemonge> lol you dont know the url?
[20:35:55] <Prot> nop
[20:37:56] <eddiemonge> then how are you going to do an ajax call?
[20:38:09] <Prot> when I say I don't know the url
[20:38:12] <Prot> I mean codewise
[20:38:16] <Prot> obviously i have it in a variable
[20:38:35] <Prot> i don't know if its url?params=values
[20:38:38] <Prot> or just url/
[20:38:41] <Prot> or url.html
[20:38:42] <Prot> or what
[20:39:53] <Prot> writing my own url builder seems like reinventing the wheel
[20:39:58] <Prot> i guess its the only choice really
[20:47:06] <dogarrhea2_> hello.
[20:47:25] <dogarrhea2_> how do I specify that a draggable element move to the mouse pointer by a certain amount when you start the drag?
[20:47:35] <dogarrhea2_> basically a "snap to mouse" on start drag
[20:49:22] <dogarrhea2_> guess i'll have to write my own
[20:49:38] <eddiemonge> using jqueryUI?
[20:52:26] <kborchers> dogarrhea2_: i think you want the cursorAt option see ?ui.draggable
[20:52:27] <bot-t> dogarrhea2_, The jQuery UI Draggable plugin makes selected elements draggable by mouse. http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/
[20:53:01] <kborchers> assuming you're using UI draggable
[20:53:21] <dogarrhea2_> yea i'm using ui draggable
[20:56:03] <dogarrhea2_> ok that worked. thanks

[21:08:04] <SkyFlyer> can anyone help me with jsonp ?  I need a little explaination on it... it's driving me nuts.   I do a call .json?callback=?  and it wraps the results with ?([data])       ahh? anyone?
[21:08:56] <eddiemonge> lol SkyFlyer im working with jsonp right now
[21:09:12] <eddiemonge> but yes thats how its done
[21:09:53] <SkyFlyer> yeah. i'm pulling my hair out at 9:09 at night!  I'll paste the code
[21:10:13] <chjj> SkyFlyer: jsonp relies on the fact that json is valid javascript and that <script> elements bypass the cross origin policy
[21:13:12] <SkyFlyer> http://pastebin.com/V5HbzkH7
[21:14:13] <SkyFlyer> yeah. its cross orgin. cross domain.  for some reason it's working half the time.  but now i'm getting this error ... Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
[21:15:55] <context> roommates girlfriend just asked how to spell dinosaur
[21:18:13] <eddiemonge> SkyFlyer: you could pass all that stuff into the {} data
[21:19:41] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/JNu8a/
[21:20:00] <SkyFlyer> yeah. its just late and i'm stupid and frustrated.   I slowed down and now i see the issue... fuck me. time to quit and go to bed!!!
[21:20:59] <dogarrhea2_> btw, why are jqueryui.it google search results higher than the actual jqueryui site stuff in google?
[21:21:21] <dogarrhea2_> and why doesn't the real one do the same thing as jqueryui.it in order to be back on top?
[21:21:24] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2_: because they are good at black hat seo and google is sometimes dumb
[21:21:30] <eddiemonge> but we are working on it
[21:27:25] <SkyFlyer> so the problem too with the Json object i'm getting back is that if you have  {callback : '?'} it encodes the ?   so how do you get around th?
[21:27:27] <SkyFlyer> that?
[21:29:28] <eddiemonge> SkyFlyer: in your server side code, say php, you would do echo $_GET['callback']
[21:31:08] <SkyFlyer> yeah. i'm fixing all these errors slowly. i'm just too tire for it now.  It's quitten time... 11.5 hrs later
[21:33:28] <amh345> have any of you guys worked with the jQuery SWFObject plugin? havin' a silly issue with this.Play. cant target the frame properly

[21:36:35] <dogarrhea2_> i want to make the slider buttons smaller on that page (i am assuming that the stuff on the left changes styles there)
[21:37:25] <eddiemonge> some stuff you have to do on your own
[21:37:55] <eddiemonge> id also be careful about making the slider buttons smaller as they are pretty small to begin with
[21:38:14] <dogarrhea2_> haha. they almost take up 1/3 of my image :(
[21:42:55] <dogarrhea2_> ok so it doesn't work the search continues
[21:54:22] <dogarrhea2_> so how do i actually change the slider icon..
[22:00:52] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2_: download the theme and then modify it
[22:03:04] <dogarrhea2_> haha i think i'm doing sometihng more hackish
[22:03:32] <dogarrhea2_> i'm looking at .ui-state-default, .ui-widget-content .ui-state-default, .ui-widget-header .ui-state-default in chrome and copy pasting that code and modifying the image url
[22:05:43] <dogarrhea2_> it's so annoying looking at a dozen or so crossed out css rules
