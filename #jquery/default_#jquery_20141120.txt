[00:58:11] <DevAntoine> hi
[00:58:47] <DevAntoine> I've got to update a button's state depending on two selects value. What's the best way to do it?
[01:00:44] <Cork> DevAntoine: by selects you mean select elements?
[01:00:58] <DevAntoine> Cork: yep
[01:01:11] <Cork> then bind a change event on the two selects
[01:01:23] <Cork> and when it fire change a class on the button
[01:02:04] <DevAntoine> Cork: what I need is disabling a button when those two selects have no value
[01:02:47] <DevAntoine> Cork: firing an event when one value changes does not work
[01:02:58] <Cork> DevAntoine: so $('button').prop('disabled', (select1.val() + select2.val()) == '');
[01:03:10] <Cork> DevAntoine: it should
[01:03:53] <Cork> DevAntoine: or $('button').prop('disabled', (select1.val() == '' && select2.val()) == '');
[01:04:00] <Cork> if you need both to be enabled
[01:04:07] <Cork> *none blank
[01:04:11] <Cork> opps
[01:04:17] <Cork> DevAntoine: or $('button').prop('disabled', (select1.val() == '' && select2.val() == ''));
[01:04:40] <DevAntoine> Cork: and it will be fired every time on of the two select's value change?
[01:04:55] <Cork> DevAntoine: you will have to run that line in a change event handler
[01:05:13] <DevAntoine> Cork: yep, beding change to the two selects
[01:05:19] <DevAntoine> s/beding/binding
[01:26:38] <Pinchiukas> So what is the best way to have an associative array?
[01:35:13] <wfq> hi guys
[01:35:43] <Cork> Pinchiukas: you don't you use an object
[01:35:54] <Cork> Pinchiukas: assosiative arrays is a php term
[01:36:08] <Cork> hash/map/object is what you use in all other languages
[01:36:09] <wfq> I just want to be able to handle an ajax callback. What I am fetching fro the server is true or false however I can't figure it out how to pick this value an ddo something. I have tried with done as well.
[01:36:55] <Cork> wfq: simplest is to set content-type application/json (from the server)
[01:37:01] <Cork> and data would just be the parsed value
[01:37:12] <Cork> so if you return false for example
[01:37:15] <Cork> data == false
[01:38:15] <wfq> Cork thanks. That isn't the problem. The problem is I need to pass the return from the ajax call to another function. For example var response = myAjaxCall(); if (true) {} else {}
[01:38:23] <Cork> ah
[01:38:29] <Cork> ajax is async you can't ever return it
[01:38:40] <wfq> no even with done?
[01:38:40] <Cork> you can return a deferred
[01:38:56] <Cork> you can do myAjaxCall().done(function(data) {})
[01:39:04] <Cork> but you can't get the data out of the .done callback
[01:39:18] <wfq> exactly that is the problem I am having
[01:39:43] <Cork> wfq: the reason for this is that is that the code inside the callback function runs when the response comes back
[01:39:51] <Cork> so the return after the call happens before
[01:40:20] <Cork> ex myAjaxCall().done(function(data) { console.log(1) }); console.log(2)
[01:40:31] <Cork> will result in 2 and 1 (that order)
[01:40:58] <Cork> i can be more technical if you like, just ask :)
[01:41:11] <wfq> sure. I thought that done was retaining the exectuing thread until the response was returned
[01:41:20] <Cork> no js isn't threaded
[01:41:27] <Cork> every thing happens in one thread
[01:41:33] <Cork> so if it would block the thread
[01:41:47] <Cork> the update, user interaction, git animations and so on would freeze
[01:42:01] <wfq> yup I totally get it
[01:42:03] <Cork> until the server responds
[01:42:19] <Erwat> i think i've seen an application like that once
[01:42:34] <Cork> googlegroups is one of my big hater for it
[01:42:35] <Pinchiukas> Cork: and how do I correctly use an object in that sense?
[01:42:40] <Cork> they use sync ajax calls for everything -_-'
[01:42:52] <Cork> Pinchiukas: { key: value }
[01:43:23] <Cork> Pinchiukas: var obj = { array: [1,2,3,4,5] }; obj.array[2] == 3
[01:45:02] <Erwat> you can also do obj["array"][2] == 3
[01:45:12] <Pinchiukas> I don't get it...
[01:45:36] <Cork> Pinchiukas: an associative array in php is an object in javascript
[01:46:04] <Pinchiukas> Can you give me an example that'd be more clear for a newbie in JS which I am? :)
[01:46:09] <Cork> so Array("key" => value) becomes { key: value } or { "key": "value"}
[01:46:24] <wfq> Cork thanks. Sorry I faced this problem a few years ago but somehow I got in the trap again. This is because I saw a code that I need to change and rather than restructuring I just carried on following the same principles
[01:46:26] <wfq> thanks again
[01:46:46] <Pinchiukas> Lets just leave PHP out of this ok?
[01:47:00] <Cork> Pinchiukas: well you asked about associative arrays
[01:47:06] <Cork> and that only exist in php as far as i know :)
[01:47:29] <Pinchiukas> What is the syntax to create an object with several (string) named members that have string values assigned to them?
[01:47:44] <Erwat> that's it
[01:48:00] <Cork> uh, i just gave it to you...
[01:48:12] <Erwat> var foo = { "key1": "value1", "key2": "value2" }
[01:48:16] <Cork> or { key1: "value1", key2: "value2", key3: "value3" }
[01:48:32] <Cork> the quotes around the key is only needed if it contains a dot or space
[01:48:33] <Pinchiukas> Thanks, Erwat. :)
[01:48:47] <Pinchiukas> Cork: I do need some way to reference to the object don't I ?:)
[01:49:06] <Cork> Pinchiukas: <Cork> Pinchiukas: var obj = { array: [1,2,3,4,5] }; obj.array[2] == 3 <--
[01:49:15] <Cork> i even gave you an example of how you would do that
[01:49:29] <Erwat> Pinchiukas: yes, in the example i gave that reference would be the variable named "foo"
[01:49:43] <Erwat> so you can do foo.key1 or foo["key1"]
[01:49:47] <Pinchiukas> What the hell is "array" for in Corks example?
[01:49:57] <Cork> Pinchiukas: the key "array" inside the object
[01:50:13] <Pinchiukas> So it's an object with an array as a member?
[01:50:15] <Cork> Pinchiukas: obj is an object with a key array
[01:50:23] <Cork> and the array key has an array of 5 elements
[01:50:25] <Cork> yes
[01:50:41] <Pinchiukas> Why did you give me such a convoluted example?
[01:50:46] <Cork> O_o'
[01:50:51] <Cork> convoluted??
[01:51:36] <_rgn> wow. learn js basics from a book or website, not on irc
[01:51:42] <Pinchiukas> If I need something that works like associative arrays in PHP, I'd say the best way would have to create an object with members having string values, isn't it?
[01:52:19] <Pinchiukas> There is a lot of different info, I thought you guys will be the most current source. :)
[01:54:02] <Cork> Pinchiukas: [] is an array and {} is an object
[01:54:10] <Cork> the left side of : is the key
[01:54:14] <Cork> and the right side is the value
[01:54:24] <_rgn> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects
[01:54:35] <Cork> from that standpoint the example is straight forward

[02:21:07] <Asenar> Hi, I'm using jstree and it seems the documentation is wrong for changed.jstree event. Do you know something about it ? http://www.jstree.com/api/#/?q=changed.jstree&f=changed.jstree
[02:22:13] <Asenar> When I console.log() arguments, the first seems to be the fired event, and the second is a object containing action, event, instance, node and selected
[02:42:32] <CrizMobius> How do I make a scrollbar that's independent of content?
[02:43:52] <Cork> CrizMobius: you could just have a place holder element that pushes the element apart
[02:44:01] <Cork> and put it beside what you normally have
[02:44:41] <Cork> ex <div class="scroller"><div></div></div> .scroller { overflow: auto; } .scroller div { height: 10000px; }
[02:46:16] <CrizMobius> The thing is I have a table that is too large but I want to be able to scroll it anyway. For that I need to load table content as I scroll.
[02:47:32] <Cork> CrizMobius: there is two options either have a fake scroller
[02:47:55] <Cork> CrizMobius: or have a padder above and belove
[02:48:02] <Cork> and expand it when you remove an element
[02:48:15] <Cork> that way the scroll behaves like it is expected to
[02:50:09] <CrizMobius> I don't really get it

[04:34:37] <IamTrying> How to make Hexadiagonal boxes ? http://keekerdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/HexGridLandscapeBase.png ?
[04:35:34] <jamesheston> Anyone have any advice on best structure for a jquery plugin?
[04:36:08] <jamesheston> I've seen the official jquery docs page on it. Just wondering if anyone had some personal preferences.
[04:42:28] <IamTrying> Is all Senior jQuery dudes retired from here? How to make hexadiagonal boxes?
[04:42:59] <Shedros> Hi there, does somebody know where I can get support for flot?
[04:43:21] <Erwat> what's a hexadiagonal box?
[04:44:54] <IamTrying> Erwat: http://www.queness.com/resources/html/css3-hexagon/index.html
[04:44:55] <Cork> IamTrying: either stack a few divs ontop of each other and use translate
[04:44:58] <pothepanda> is something wrong with jquery-ui's selectmenu maxHeight ? it doesnt seem to work and apply maxHeight to the drop down. any help ?
[04:45:01] <Cork> or use svg
[04:45:50] <IamTrying> Cork: i am trying to make something like this http://www.queness.com/resources/html/css3-hexagon/index.html but 50 hexadiagonal boxes in one page preview
[04:47:36] <Cork> IamTrying: that page does it with divs and transform (sorry said translate)
[04:48:10] <diegoaguilar> Hello, at this code snippet I got a function iterating over some collection's elements, for each I do a setTimeout because I want to do "something" each 3.5 seconds delay. But as I coded it it will do it to all of them at SAME time after 3.5 seconds
[04:48:11] <IamTrying> Excellent thanks Cork, but is it reliable for many browsers? or there can be jQuery version of such
[04:48:19] <diegoaguilar> http://www.hastebin.com/nederarufo.vhdl
[04:48:26] <diegoaguilar> how can I achieve it?
[04:48:38] <Cork> IamTrying: none css3 browsers can't do it
[04:48:46] <Cork> so you can forget about pre ie10
[04:48:58] <decx> it's also quite the esoteric implementation
[04:49:04] <IamTrying> OK - Cork, thank you Guru.
[04:49:15] <decx> i wouldnt use it in prod
[04:49:17] <Cork> if you use svg instead (or vml for ie) you can get much longer support
[04:49:31] <IamTrying> OK
[04:49:45] <Cork> vml is supported in ie5 if i remember correctly :)
[04:50:13] <Cork> but you will have to deal with cross document glory if you go that route
[04:57:09] <IamTrying> OK - have to follow your suggestion
[05:17:14] <Tomashe> Hye guys how can i remove all divs except a specific div eq(0)
[05:17:21] <Tomashe> except the last dive
[05:18:08] <Tomashe> ok got it
[05:18:29] <CrizMobius> I can't get the scroll event to work
[05:18:31] <Cork> Tomashe: just do .not(element).remove()
[05:18:46] <CrizMobius> Is there something special I need to do in order to get it to work
[05:19:04] <Cork> CrizMobius: no just attache it on the element with the scrollbar and it should work just fine
[05:19:45] <CrizMobius> the element has the css { overflow: scroll; } is that enough?
[05:20:00] <Cork> sure
[05:20:15] <CrizMobius> then $(element).scroll(function(){});
[05:21:44] <Cork> CrizMobius: http://jsfiddle.net/rpred969/
[05:23:07] <CrizMobius> works thx =)

[06:18:44] <limpc> hi.. im using ckeditor in an inline colorbox popup.  the target textarea has text in it.  when invoked the first time, everything seems normal, I get a CKeditor instance that contains the text of the textbox.  However, any subsequent calls for the colorbox object have an empty textarea.  I'm not erasing the contents of the textarea.  any idea whats going on?
[06:19:39] <dieguezz> hi, i got an id per section in my dom. How can i save the id's in an array? something like$('section').each(function(item){arr.push(item.id)}
[06:20:36] <BillCriswell> dieguezz: .map
[06:20:54] <BillCriswell> dieguezz: $('section').map(function () { return this.id }).get(); should do it I think.
[06:21:48] <dieguezz> thanks BillCriswell
[06:22:09] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/qucavuhuba/1/edit?html,js,output
[06:23:27] <BillCriswell> dieguezz: No problem.
[06:26:13] <DevAntoine> I've got a template row, which I clone. Every td has a given class. On a perf point of view, is it better to select each td and set its content or make some sort of place holder, get all the row's html and do a string replacement of all the place holders?
[06:29:51] <BillCriswell> I think string replacement would be quicker (but I'd use some type of templating.
[06:34:39] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: Something like _.template('<tr><td><%= name %></td><td><%= age %></tr>', { name: "Bill", age: 29 });
[06:37:35] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: ok, thanks
[06:37:54] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: I don't wanna use a templating system for a table's row, seems overkill
[06:39:51] <bbclover> hey guys when you use .css('display', ''); does that set the display to default?
[06:40:08] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: Fair enough.
[06:41:35] <DevAntoine> or I can use that http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/ BillCriswell
[06:41:46] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: Yes.
[06:42:11] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: I typically have underscore available, which uses that for the most part.
[06:43:19] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: yeah, I wish I could :/
[06:44:12] <BillCriswell> bbclover: I don't believe so but I could be wrong.
[06:45:41] <BillCriswell> uh oh...

[06:56:46] <BillCriswell> nodedfree: I had that happen as well.
[06:56:49] <Cork> ah
[06:57:03] <Cork> so api.jquery.com is down
[06:57:05] <Cork> can reproduce that
[06:57:12] <DevAntoine> if I chain 'success()' to $.post and not passing it the "success" callback, I can't specify the datatype?
[06:57:27] <DevAntoine> oh, I have to set it at null
[06:57:30] <DevAntoine> rtfm more
[06:57:58] <Cork> bbclover, nodedfree reported
[06:58:30] <DevAntoine> yes, doc is partially done for at least one hour
[07:01:13] <bbclover> i don't know nodejs
[07:02:15] <Cork> DevAntoine: $.post takes .done not .success
[07:02:28] <Cork> at least if you use an up to date jquery
[07:10:06] <dieguezz> hi, how can i save an object like: {id: value, id: value... } where the id is the id of the selector and the value the offset().top ?
[07:10:33] <theshit123> hi, i want to get a page and access to his elements so in first place i was thinking about parse html string, which i taked with get, to a dom object (parseHTML function), but when i do this the browser try to take the sources (images), i dont want to take them so how can i do it?
[07:10:43] <Cork> dieguezz: how to save it?
[07:10:54] <Cork> not sure what the question is here
[07:11:24] <Cork> bbclover, nodedfree: the service is up again
[07:11:25] <bbclover> if I just want to add a hidden div somewhere can I do $('<div id="toggleResize "display="none">Hey</div>').append(document); (it doesn't matter where I place it)
[07:11:41] <dieguezz> Cork i got some elements in my DOM and i want to make an object with them, store ids and its ofset in an object
[07:11:53] <dieguezz> selectors as keys and scrolltop as value
[07:11:59] <Cork> bbclover: document.body not document
[07:12:02] <Cork> but yes to the rest
[07:12:04] <bbclover> $('<div id="toggleResize" display="none">Hey</div>').append(document); rather
[07:12:06] <bbclover> oh ok
[07:12:37] <bbclover> Cork where can I read about the document objecterino
[07:12:47] <Cork> ?mdn document

[07:13:07] <mooncup> anyone know of a reason why javascript inside an ajax loaded div won't run?
[07:13:18] <mooncup> the first line in the loaded page is <script>alert('test');</script>
[07:13:21] <mooncup> and yet I get nothing
[07:13:41] <Cork> mooncup: jquery explicitly disable it
[07:14:02] <Cork> cause it gets weird effects when you serialize and reparse html
[07:14:25] <mooncup> Cork: oh
[07:14:30] <mooncup> I'm sure I've used it before
[07:14:35] <mooncup> is there a way to allow it?
[07:14:43] <mooncup> I'm trying to load pages inside lightboxes
[07:14:45] <Cork> mooncup: you could do something like $('#target')[0].innerHTML = data; to get around it
[07:14:45] <mooncup> but I don't wanna use iframes
[07:14:54] <mooncup> ok I shall give it a go
[07:14:55] <Cork> though i don't recommend embedding js in the html
[07:14:56] <BillCriswell> dieguezz: Something like var obj = {}; Then loop and do obj[this.id] = $(this).offset().left;
[07:16:27] <dieguezz> ty BillCriswell  ill try :)
[07:18:13] <bbclover> cork that document.body gave me a ton of errors and my site crashed
[07:18:25] <bbclover> is this: $('<div id="toggleResize" display="none">Hey</div>').append($('.content-div')); better? content-div is a container
[07:18:25] <Cork> uh what?
[07:18:53] <bbclover> it gave me 25+ appendChild errors or something
[07:19:04] <DevAntoine> Cork: yes, I use done, my bad
[07:19:26] <BillCriswell> bbclover: I have a ask. If your last name Clover?
[07:19:26] <Cork> bbclover: http://jsfiddle.net/ed6btp1q/ should work just fine
[07:21:03] <usrb1n> Hello everybody. I have a question regarding load. I have checked many examples and all of them are related to load into a div or whatever else element. So it's $('#divid').load(url). But I want to work with that information. I want to store it in a variable and then apply some filters over it in order to extract only the desired information. How can I do that?
[07:21:52] <bbclover> BillCriswell: nope, but it's about www.bbc.com haha... so many people think something else
[07:21:53] <Cork> usrb1n: then you want $.get or $.ajax not .load
[07:22:25] <usrb1n> Thanks Cork , gonna look
[07:22:30] <BillCriswell> bbclover: Yeah that's what I was getting at lol
[07:22:53] <usrb1n> BTW, do you know if the 502 error on api.jquery.com is a known issue?
[07:23:45] <usrb1n> It's working now. Sorry (Error 502 Ray ID: 18c5a42cb6a00622 Bad gateway(

[07:26:12] <talexb> I'm trying to get some simple code to run in a page; I look for a selected row in Roundcube $('tr.selected') and based on whether that hasClass('focused'), trigger a mousdown event. Using console.log messages, I confirm it's working fine in the console, but it's not behaving on the page. Why is that?

[07:26:39] <BillCriswell> talexb: Sounds like you're running the code before the HTML is ready.
[07:27:08] <talexb> BillCriswell, Ah. And how do I delay execution? Wait for ready()?
[07:27:16] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[07:27:32] <talexb> Thanks! :)
[07:27:33] <BillCriswell> $(function() { /* Do your thing... */ });
[07:27:51] <talexb> :( I'm already doing that.
[07:28:06] <BillCriswell> talexb: Is the data being ajaxed in?
[07:28:33] <talexb> Nope -- I look to see if a row's selected, and if not, trigger a mousedown. It's really simple.
[07:29:02] <BillCriswell> talexb: Any errors in the console? Can you replicate it with jsfiddle.net?
[07:29:04] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: the jsbin link was for me?
[07:29:16] <bbclover> Cork: I had the opposite
[07:29:33] <bbclover> you said $(document.body).append('<div>hello</div>'); I did $('<div></div>').append(document.body);
[07:29:40] <talexb> BillCriswell, No errors on the console. It's rather a large chunk of code (Roundcube settings page) ..
[07:29:45] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: Yes.
[07:30:11] <Cork> bbclover: ya, you can't append the document to a div
[07:30:12] <talexb> But I think there is some sort of timing issue going on ..
[07:30:17] <Cork> that will kinda break things :)
[07:30:30] <mooncup> hey Cork
[07:30:43] <mooncup> the javascript is still loaded in
[07:30:46] <mooncup> it's just not executing
[07:30:49] <mooncup> is that how it normally works?
[07:30:57] <Cork> the js isn't loaded
[07:30:57] <bbclover> Cork yeah! you said it was fine haha
[07:30:58] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: var map2 = $('section').get().reduce(function (val, el) { val[el.id] = $(el).offset().top; return val; }, {}); would also work.
[07:31:02] <Cork> but the script tag is added to the page
[07:31:09] <Cork> and yes that is normal
[07:31:14] <BillCriswell> IF you don't want to do: jQuery.fn.reduce = [].reduce;
[07:31:19] <Cork> bbclover: i read append as appendTo
[07:31:22] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: I don't know what you're talking about
[07:31:23] <Cork> not sure what you wrote
[07:31:34] <mooncup> ah fair enough
[07:31:48] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: Didn't you want a list of the element ids and their offsets?
[07:31:51] <Cork> anyway gtg
[07:31:57] <BillCriswell> Cork: Bye Cork.
[07:32:00] <BillCriswell> Cork.
[07:32:01] <mooncup> in a bit
[07:35:09] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: I was wrong lol
[07:35:40] <BillCriswell> dieguezz: http://jsbin.com/pigetogelu/2/edit?js,output <--
[07:35:46] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: Sorry about that.
[07:35:58] <usrb1n> Cork: .get works like a charm ! Just wanted to know if It stills possible to search an element by ID. For example, can I get the values of a table from the returned data?
[07:37:25] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: np ;)
[07:39:51] <usrb1n> Tried the following: var test = $('#submitBtn', data).innerHTML;  in order to use selectors on the data obtained by .get
[07:39:56] <usrb1n> Is this even possible ? :)
[07:42:07] <BillCriswell> usrb1n: That should give you an error.
[07:42:32] <usrb1n> Nothing on my console. but it's not working
[07:43:51] <BillCriswell> usrb1n: var $content = $('#content'); $content.load('foo.html', function () { $content.find('.something-in-foo-html').css('color', 'red'); });
[07:44:40] <usrb1n> That was my main problem, that I didn't wanted to load the information into an element. So I have used .get instead of load
[07:44:54] <usrb1n> now I have the information in a variable called data (all the HTML page)
[07:47:35] <BillCriswell> usrb1n: I think you'd want to approach it like this: $.get('page.html', function (html) { var $html = $(html); $html.find('#id').whatever(); }); ?
[07:51:15] <NorthBlast> anyone has use chosen plugin?
[07:51:40] <NorthBlast> I'm looking for demo on how to add it to my project but not much luck..
[07:51:44] <usrb1n> BillCriswell: Right....I am trying to adapt your model to my necesity. I need exactly that but in order to extract the information.
[07:51:47] <usrb1n> BillCriswell:  $.get( url, function( data ) { var $data = $(data); var dummyVal = $data('#itemSubmissionsTable').innerHTML; });
[07:51:59] <usrb1n> Something like this, I want to extract the value of that ID
[07:52:04] <usrb1n> Is that correct?
[07:52:09] <NorthBlast> Well, actually I think you need to add the files or something like to make it work. I wondering which one
[07:52:30] <jamesheston> Anyone have any recommendations on really well-written, recently updated plugins they like? Mostly looking for code to borrow code practices from.
[07:53:17] <BillCriswell> usrb1n: There is no .innerHTML jQuery method.
[07:53:22] <BillCriswell> usrb1n: You have to look at your console.
[07:53:37] <BillCriswell> You'd do $data.find('#something').html()
[07:55:51] <usrb1n> BillCriswell: Awesome !!! Thank you. The console returned nothing with only innerHTML. But that is exactly what I was needing. Thank you !
[07:56:08] <BillCriswell> usrb1n: No problem.
[08:01:34] <bbclover> guys if I have this div with a certain class which has an <a> tag in it, and I want to add another <a> tag to it right next to it horizontally in the div, how would I do that?
[08:02:41] <Hypfer> whats the best way to save an object in the data-something attribute of something?
[08:04:06] <BillCriswell> bbclover: $('a').next('<a href="#">New A</a>');
[08:04:22] <bbclover> thanks!
[08:11:03] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:14:52] <nettoweb> guys, can someone help me with this menu: http://jsfiddle.net/osnysantos/Lq6nmq44/ I wondering how I do to sub-menu slide from bottom of main menu with animate.... like SlideUp.
[08:14:57] <nettoweb> like linkedin menu work
[08:16:27] <nettoweb> I tried this: .animate({'top': '0'},'slow') that work but with no animation
[08:17:29] <naprac> how can i change color of dynamically created elements?
[08:17:48] <cjohnson> you can modify the CSS of any node with $node.css()
[08:18:02] <cjohnson> doesn't matter if it was dynamically created or not
[08:18:10] <cjohnson> http://api.jquery.com/css/
[08:18:21] <BillCriswell> nettoweb: I'd use CSS to animate and just toggle a class on the element.
[08:18:30] <naprac> whats the matte with the website, is it down?
[08:18:40] <cjohnson> responding slowly here
[08:18:51] <nettoweb> ;/
[08:19:55] <bbclover> I got an error with $('.ui-coding-container-header').next('<a href="#" id="continue">Continue</a>');
[08:20:08] <naprac> this works $("#wrap").on('click','.target', function(e){$(this).css("color","#f00");}); but how to change all targets color without clik?
[08:20:09] <cjohnson> well let's see the error then.
[08:20:15] <cjohnson> "I got an error" is useless
[08:20:34] <bbclover> 'Syntax error, unrecognized expression: <a href="#" id="continue">Continue</a>'
[08:20:36] <cjohnson> naprac: just call the .css method directly on the targets
[08:20:45] <naprac> how???
[08:20:49] <cjohnson> bbclover: .next($('<a ...'))
[08:21:07] <cjohnson> naprac: $targets.css('color', '#f00')
[08:21:12] <cjohnson> where $targets are your targets
[08:21:38] <cjohnson> you might want to start here if you aren't sure how to define a selector for your targets: http://learn.jquery.com/
[08:22:08] <nettoweb> BillCriswell Can I do something like linkedin.com?
[08:22:11] <naprac> like $(".target").css('color','#f00)? that doesn't work
[08:22:15] <nettoweb> with just css animation?
[08:22:18] <BillCriswell> nettoweb: Of course.
[08:22:51] <cjohnson> naprac: that would change the text color of every element with class=target to #f00
[08:22:53] <Oka> What we really need are some testcases up in here.
[08:23:05] <cjohnson> naprac: so if that isn't working, either your selector is wrong, or your CSS is wrong
[08:23:10] <Oka> Whole lot of guesswork going on right now.
[08:23:21] <naprac> hmm let me check
[08:23:23] <bbclover> cjohnson will that place that new anchor?
[08:23:33] <cjohnson> bbclover: I believe so
[08:23:46] <cjohnson> it expects a node or jqueyr collection though, not a string
[08:24:16] <cjohnson> oh wait no I think he got that wrong
[08:24:25] <cjohnson> if you want to append a node after another node it's .after()
[08:24:42] <cjohnson> $someNode.after( $('<a>') )  will put an anchor after $someNode
[08:24:52] <bbclover> well I will to add an anchor in a div
[08:25:01] <cjohnson> right
[08:25:01] <bbclover> which is of that class
[08:25:12] <cjohnson> use .after to append a node after another node
[08:26:00] <cjohnson> if you want to just add a node inside another ndoe, that's .append
[08:26:44] <naprac> this does not work and checked that class name is .target, these .targets are dyn elements, does that matter? $(".target").css('color','#f00');
[08:28:06] <cjohnson> naprac: doesn't matter if they're dynamic elements, but obviously you need to wait until they exist to call this
[08:28:07] <BillCriswell> nettoweb: http://jsbin.com/jokajalise/1/edit?css,js,output The logic for toggling the class will need some work, but this shoudl get you close.
[08:28:39] <cjohnson> naprac: http://jsfiddle.net/hv2ke7cs/
[08:28:50] <naprac> cjohnson: can i do this with .on thing?
[08:28:51] <nettoweb> BillCriswell could be like this: http://jsfiddle.net/osnysantos/Lq6nmq44/
[08:29:22] <BillCriswell> nettoweb: Just posted a link for you
[08:29:31] <cjohnson> naprac: now obviously if the element is created after that code executes it won't be colored: http://jsfiddle.net/hv2ke7cs/1/
[08:29:54] <cjohnson> naprac: no, not really. event delegation only helps with events, not running code after an element is created. you'll have to add your .css code into whatever code is creating the element
[08:29:57] <naprac> yes i think thats the case because the on.click thing works
[08:30:11] <naprac> ic
[08:30:14] <nettoweb> BillCriswell I saw, but I already jave an script, Im trying to use that
[08:30:28] <cjohnson> naprac: for instance: http://jsfiddle.net/hv2ke7cs/3/
[08:30:39] <cjohnson> compared to the last one, I moved the css code into the function that created the node, and now it's colored
[08:31:02] <Jelmer_> Hi all, i'm hoping to get some help on tje Jquery validator. I need to add a costum method wich runs the entry to a regex. Any help would be appriciated alot!
[08:31:24] <naprac> well i create the elements in php first and then try to add this jquery thing
[08:31:27] <nettoweb> BillCriswell did you see my link with some changes?
[08:31:35] <BillCriswell> nettoweb: Yes.
[08:31:45] <BillCriswell> You'd just have to use that logic you have to toggle a class.
[08:32:05] <cjohnson> naprac: if it's created in PHP then it exists at page load
[08:32:12] <cjohnson> naprac: you may just need to move your .css code above </body>
[08:32:17] <nettoweb> But the class is already toggle... I was trying to do the animation with css
[08:32:21] <cjohnson> or wait with document.ready
[08:32:47] <cjohnson> naprac: if you're using PHP to generate the HTML though, why even use jquery at all?
[08:32:52] <cjohnson> just make the PHP output it with the right class
[08:32:55] <cjohnson> and use CSS to define the color
[08:33:21] <cjohnson> there's no point doing $('.someclass').css(...), just define .someclass in your CSS file
[08:33:29] <cjohnson> you get the benefit of not worrying about race conditions
[08:33:41] <BillCriswell> nettoweb: Put transition: all .5s on the sub element.
[08:34:06] <nettoweb> ease?
[08:34:12] <nettoweb> I've put
[08:34:16] <nettoweb> http://jsfiddle.net/osnysantos/Lq6nmq44/
[08:34:25] <naprac> i was doing something more complicating than color, but got stuck because it wont allow me to refer to element or something
[08:35:14] <cjohnson> naprac: what are you trying to do? don't ask questions about made up problems, ask your real quetions
[08:35:31] <cjohnson> unless you're trying to calculate specific widths or something chances are you don't need jquery here
[08:35:31] <naprac> why is this working then? $("#wrap").on('click','.target', function(e){$(this).css("color","#f00");});
[08:35:54] <cjohnson> for the reasons given above
[08:35:57] <cjohnson> ask your *real* question
[08:35:59] <nettoweb> BillCriswell I added position: fixed; to .down but I think this is exactly whats removing the animation effect
[08:36:02] <cjohnson> what CSS are you trying to apply?
[08:36:13] <BillCriswell> nettoweb: http://jsbin.com/jokajalise/2/edit?html,css,js,output how about this?
[08:36:26] <naprac> i'm trying to add a cornetr into element
[08:36:30] <naprac> corner
[08:36:47] <cjohnson> corners are simple CSS, you don't need jquery for that
[08:36:51] <naprac> but the task is basically same as changin the color
[08:37:07] <cjohnson> just make a class in CSS that gives the element a color, and in your PHP output that class onto the elements
[08:37:16] <cjohnson> gives the element a corner*
[08:38:16] <bbclover> if I have this scroll bar for overflow-x how can I make it so when I click this anchor it moves the scrollbar a certain amount?
[08:38:19] <BillCriswell> nettoweb: There we go, even less code: http://jsbin.com/jokajalise/3/edit
[08:38:45] <cjohnson> bbclover: use normal HTML anchor links
[08:39:06] <bbclover> what do you mean
[08:39:06] <cjohnson> href="#something"  and then give an element id="something"  where you want the link to scroll to
[08:39:13] <nettoweb> BillCriswell brillhant, i just have to adapt to my case.. Im trying right now
[08:39:21] <cjohnson> and when you click the link with href="#something" it takes you to the node with id="something"
[08:39:48] <Jelmer_> Does anyone have a second to help me with the Jquery validation?
[08:40:03] <naprac> never mind, it was on wrong line
[08:40:09] <cjohnson> oh nevermind I misread what you wrote, you want to scroll a specific amount. use $(node).scrollTop
[08:40:18] <cjohnson> Jelmer_: don't ask to ask, just ask
[08:40:42] <cjohnson> naprac: from what you described, using jquery/javascript to solve this problem is absolutely not the right way to do it
[08:40:47] <cjohnson> just use a class
[08:41:07] <Bloomberg> Hi Guys!!
[08:41:08] <naprac> .target is a class
[08:41:22] <cjohnson> alright, then in your CSS file, define .target { border-radius: 15px; }
[08:41:24] <cjohnson> problem solved
[08:41:25] <Jelmer_> Alright, i'm trying to make a costum method in the validation wich check if it is a zip code. the regex is /^[1-9][0-9]{3}[ ]?([A-RT-Za-rt-z][A-Za-z]|[sS][BCbcE-Re-rT-Zt-z])$/,
[08:41:32] <Bloomberg> how can Ito acces to data-key info with jquery autocomplete
[08:41:34] <Bloomberg> I have this
[08:41:34] <Bloomberg> jquery
[08:41:37] <naprac> anyway i solved it by moving the code on the end of file
[08:41:39] <Bloomberg> array_push($data,array("label"=>str_replace("_", " ", $lFile), "value"=>str_replace("_", " ", $lFile), "data-key"=>$ruta));
[08:41:46] <Jelmer_> But i am very unfamiliar with jQuery and the validation it uses
[08:41:47] <cjohnson> naprac: *facepalm*
[08:41:48] <Bloomberg> and
[08:41:49] <Bloomberg> select: function( event, ui ){valueSend = ui.item.data-key;}
[08:42:12] <bbclover> all righty
[08:42:20] <cjohnson> naprac: your solution won't work if you dynamically add elements. if you just use a class, it works with dynamic elements as well
[08:42:31] <cjohnson> it's a one line CSS solution
[08:43:06] <cjohnson> Jelmer_: http://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.addMethod/
[08:43:30] <cjohnson> Bloomberg: you pasted PHP, this is a channel for javascript
[08:43:46] <naprac> it doesn't matter anymore, since now i can refer to element and do whatever to it, but thanks for patience ;)
[08:43:53] <Bloomberg> and this
[08:43:53] <Bloomberg> select: function( event, ui ){valueSend = ui.item.data-key;}
[08:44:03] <Bloomberg> I need to get the data-key in jquery
[08:44:07] <Jelmer_> Thank you for awnsering, i have looked at this code. also tried to add it to my website but then the validator stopped working. Also somewhere else i read i also needed to add a rule or something?
[08:44:19] <mooncup> Bloomberg: to turn a php array into json you can use json_encode()
[08:44:27] <Bloomberg> yes
[08:44:36] <Bloomberg> Miquestion is how can I get another var
[08:44:48] <mooncup> what do you mean?
[08:44:54] <mooncup> if it's a php problem then ask ##php
[08:44:55] <cjohnson> naprac: *facepalm* enjoy your non-solution
[08:45:14] <naprac> what is this facepalm?
[08:45:28] <cjohnson> it's where I smash my palm onto my face out of frustration
[08:46:07] <Jelmer_> lol
[08:46:21] <naprac> don't frustrate tour self with css and jq stuff, there are bigger issues in world ;)
[08:46:35] <cjohnson> it's not the css or the jquery, it's the user
[08:46:46] <cjohnson> who is pushing out poor solutions into the world
[08:47:31] <BillCriswell> CSS is the biggest issue facing humanity right now.
[08:47:54] * thinkxl agrees
[08:50:03] <Ansikt> Does anyone know a way of determining if a certain CSS rule exists in the 'style' attribute of a node?
[08:50:20] <Ansikt> eg. how can I know if 'height' is set inline on an element
[08:50:52] <Ansikt> I know I could probably get .attr('style') and then use a regex, but I'm wondering if there's anything cleaner
[08:51:27] <naprac> $(this).attr("height") ?
[08:51:51] <cjohnson> Ansikt: looks like it's vile http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4781410/jquery-how-to-get-all-styles-css-defined-within-internal-external-document-w
[08:51:56] <cjohnson> prob better off just parsing the attr
[08:51:59] <BillCriswell> Ansikt: I guess you could test it against it's default value?
[08:53:02] <BillCriswell> Nevermind, that won't work.
[08:54:21] <Ansikt> naprac : I don't thing .attr height will give you style="height:1000px;"
[08:54:40] <bbclover> if I do $('.a').before($('<a href="#" id="continue">Continue</a>')); to make this new anchor, can I select it via $('#continue').click(function() { }); right away?
[08:55:00] <bbclover> it doesn't seem to be working... the anchor is here and created but clicking it does nothing. I added some console.logs that aren't appearing either
[08:55:13] <BillCriswell> Ansikt: If you just need to see if height is set in a style attribute i'd just use indexOf
[08:55:32] <naprac> yes, prolly not
[08:55:34] <BillCriswell> bbclover: Yes.
[08:56:18] <Ansikt> BillCriswell: But indexOf would give me a false positive for 'max-height'.  I'm thinking I have to do something more like:
[08:56:20] <bbclover> it's not working
[08:57:03] <yakpimp> Can anyone help me with this please? http://jsfiddle.net/1p8q7joq/ I have a form which I want to do validation (this works) but only submit if it passes validation. And I want it to call an asp.net method when it succeeds. Not sure how to even go about that at all
[08:57:25] <BillCriswell> Ansikt: .split(';') and go through
[08:57:28] <nettoweb> BillCriswell but my main menu has a dinamically height... when I scroll down the height decrease so I dont set a fixed top position, right?.
[08:57:28] <naprac> have you tryed $(this).height() ?
[08:57:35] <Ansikt> BillCriswell: hasWidth = -1 === $el.attr('style').replace(' ', '').split(';').indexOf('width');
[08:58:00] <Ansikt> still sucks, though
[08:58:45] <Ansikt> Or, !== I guess
[08:58:55] <naprac> well that doesnt tell if it's set inline or not though
[08:59:14] <Ansikt> naprac: Why wouldn't it?
[08:59:51] <nettoweb> BillCriswell that's the reason I wasnt trying to set pos fixed for both menus
[08:59:51] <naprac> i mean this only tells height of element, not how it's set $(this).height() ?
[09:00:13] <BillCriswell> bbclover: http://jsbin.com/luzalobohe/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:04:28] <NorthBlast> come on anyone?
[09:04:39] <NorthBlast> a bit of help with chosen plugin
[09:04:39] <NorthBlast> ?
[09:04:43] <NorthBlast> I can
[09:04:44] <nettoweb> BillCriswell I have realized that when scrolled to top... the menu disappear.
[09:04:46] <nettoweb> http://jsbin.com/yixubazini
[09:04:47] <BillCriswell> Ansikt: Hmm... looks like you can do this.style.height.length http://jsbin.com/hiqolupute/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[09:04:53] <NorthBlast> I cant make it to work
[09:04:55] <nettoweb> scroll to top of page.
[09:05:36] <BillCriswell> nettoweb: OSX?
[09:05:42] <nettoweb> yes
[09:06:07] <BillCriswell> Yeah, it's that bounce.
[09:07:16] <nettoweb> is there a way to fix this?
[09:08:54] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[09:10:09] <yakpimp> Is it possible to call asp.net function after doing jquery validation on a form?
[09:10:52] <BillCriswell> nettoweb: http://jsbin.com/muriqomehe/1/
[09:12:09] <BillCriswell> nettoweb: Er: http://jsbin.com/muriqomehe/2/
[09:12:12] <cjohnson> yakpimp: you can make a request to the server with ajax
[09:12:20] <cjohnson> javascript can't directly call server-side functions though, that makes no sense
[09:14:00] <yakpimp> I tried something like this, but couldn't seem to get it to work. http://www.aspsnippets.com/Articles/Call-ASPNet-Page-Method-using-jQuery-AJAX-Example.aspx
[09:14:18] <nettoweb> BillCriswell thank you but Im facing some problems with the duration of animation. I change to 5s for example but seems it stay always with 0.2s. it' very fast
[09:14:34] <nettoweb> BillCriswell I changed to transition: top 2s
[09:14:53] <BillCriswell> nettoweb: Hm?
[09:15:09] <BillCriswell> nettoweb: http://jsbin.com/muriqomehe/3/edit like this?
[09:15:36] <cjohnson> yakpimp: "couldn't get it to work" is a useless statement
[09:16:23] <yakpimp> sorry, couldn't get it to actually call my asp method
[09:16:30] <nettoweb> this works well... I tried changing to 2s too but it pass very fast. I will show you
[09:16:44] <yakpimp> it ran, and I could see the ajax firing, but it never seemed to get into my asp call
[09:16:54] <cjohnson> then that's an asp question, not a javascript question
[09:21:04] <bbclover> what do you guys think of the state of jquery and it's place in the future of web dev? the javascript summit just happened and one of the speeches was about whether jquery is needed or not
[09:22:21] <BillCriswell> bbclover: That comes up all the time. It was never technically "needed" from the beginning. I doubt it's going anywhere.
[09:23:53] <bbclover> BillCriswell I think my id is wrong.. $('.ui-coding-panel-display-content').before($('<a href="#" id="contScroll">Continue</a>')); I just can't select that element via $('#contScroll')
[09:24:20] <bbclover> it's there, I see it
[09:24:23] <bbclover> but clicking it nothing happens
[09:24:31] <cjohnson> it's a good piece of glue. lots of projects just starting up can make design choices that alleviate the need for jquery glue by using React or meteor/similar data binding, or just by using templates, etc
[09:24:58] <cjohnson> but there will be projects that don't get the option to make these design choices (or the devs won't be experienced enough to make them) all the time so glue will keep being necessary for a while
[09:25:06] <cjohnson> the problem with these summits is they don't really represent the average developer
[09:25:41] <BillCriswell> bbclover: http://jsbin.com/gociviwuto/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:25:44] <bbclover> is it bad to mix jquery with javascript
[09:25:48] <yakpimp> cjohnson: ok got it calling finally, just need to figure out how to wire it up for validation now
[09:25:49] <cjohnson> jquery is javascript
[09:25:51] <yakpimp> thanks
[09:26:06] <cjohnson> jquery is just a library, javascript is the language. jquery is written in javascript
[09:26:12] <nettoweb> BillCriswell And when I arrive at bottom, he shows the menu again
[09:26:24] <nettoweb> BillCriswell is it a OSX behavior?
[09:26:27] <BillCriswell> nettoweb: lol fuck
[09:26:42] <cjohnson> bbclover: if you're binding event handlers to elements before they exist, the event handlers won't fire
[09:26:47] <cjohnson> bbclover: you probably need event delegation
[09:26:54] <BillCriswell> nettoweb: Yes. It's because of how it bounces at the top and bottom when you scroll.
[09:27:06] <bbclover> cjohnson: it's below where I add the element
[09:27:16] <bbclover> I add it via before() then right after I try to select it
[09:27:27] <cjohnson> $('#id').on('click', function() { ... }); $(document.body).append($('<a id="id"></a>')); will not fire that click handler
[09:27:36] <cjohnson> paste your code
[09:27:41] <Oka> Let's see some testcases.
[09:27:58] <BillCriswell> bbclover: I just posted what you're doing and it works.
[09:28:15] <bbclover> http://pastebin.com/hk2z6Px9
[09:28:39] <cjohnson> the link gets appended correctly?
[09:28:56] <bbclover> yeah
[09:29:01] <cjohnson> are you sure you don't have multiple nodes with the same id?
[09:29:14] <bbclover> no, that's a brand new contScroll id I created
[09:29:19] <bbclover> I even changed it cause I thought maybe the same thing
[09:29:24] <bbclover> contScroll exists nowhere else
[09:29:24] <cjohnson> this code doesn't get executed more than once?
[09:29:39] <bbclover> it can be
[09:29:39] <cjohnson> run this in your console: $('*[id=contScroll]').length
[09:29:52] <cjohnson> after you do whatever creates that link
[09:30:08] <bbclover> k
[09:30:34] <Oka> $('body').on('click', '#contScroll', function() { ... });
[09:30:51] <bbclover> 2
[09:30:53] <bbclover> it goes from 0 to 2
[09:31:15] <bbclover> it starts at 0, but when I click the thing to create that anchor it goes to 2
[09:31:40] <cjohnson> then you're creating two elements, not just one
[09:31:47] <cjohnson> your code is being executed twice, probably
[09:31:52] <cjohnson> on its own, it works fine: http://jsfiddle.net/4m5f3qhs/
[09:32:22] <cjohnson> or more accurately I guess: http://jsfiddle.net/4m5f3qhs/1/
[09:34:28] <bbclover> hey how do you scroll right and left
[09:34:35] <bbclover> that's what I wanted
[09:34:56] <cjohnson> http://api.jquery.com/scrollleft/
[09:36:43] <bbclover> should I do $('#contScroll').get(0).click(function() { });?
[09:37:06] <cjohnson> you should figure out whatever is causing your code to execute twice
[09:37:13] <cjohnson> as teh fiddle I linked demonstrates, what you pasted works fine
[09:37:19] <bbclover> nothing should be executing it twice
[09:37:24] <cjohnson> right. but something is
[09:37:29] <cjohnson> check the fiddle I linked you
[09:37:32] <cjohnson> I copied your code verbatim
[09:37:35] <cjohnson> it runs fine there
[09:37:36] <bbclover> or maybe the length counts by 2s?
[09:37:39] <cjohnson> no.
[09:38:10] <cjohnson> try $('*[id=contScroll]')  in your console and mousing over the two links it gives you
[09:38:16] <cjohnson> they should highlight on the page
[09:38:22] <cjohnson> (in chrome)
[09:38:32] <cjohnson> figure out where the other link is coming from
[09:39:42] <bbclover> I only add the link by this one before
[09:40:52] <cjohnson> dude. if .length is 2, you have 2 links
[09:40:55] <cjohnson> there's no question about it
[09:41:05] <cjohnson> check out my fiddle, the code you pasted works perfectly fine. the length is only 1
[09:41:14] <cjohnson> clearly you have two elements though with the same id
[09:42:45] <cjohnson> so something is triggering that code twice, or something else is adding an element with the same id. console.log the matching elements to see where they are, that will be a good start
[09:43:27] <bbclover> yeah
[09:43:37] <bbclover> I see the 2 in the jquery object
[09:43:43] <bbclover> looking into it
[09:46:50] <sl33k_> I'm using gridster plugin in my page. However stuck in getting the page to be responsive as gridster generates its own styles at runtime. How do I proceed from here?
[10:03:32] <BillCriswell> nettoweb: http://jsbin.com/voposovuno/edit
[10:04:57] <BillCriswell> nettoweb: Only did that cause I knowit'll bite me in the ass one day haha
[10:05:17] <nettoweb> BillCriswell hehe thank you
[10:05:24] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[10:09:45] <skullcrasher> is there any possibility to differ between jquery object and jquery event?
[10:10:40] <cjohnson> skullcrasher: what are you trying to do?
[10:10:59] <skullcrasher> I have a function that gets called via $.proxy
[10:11:06] <skullcrasher> and it has variable arguments
[10:11:20] <skullcrasher> now i want to check if the passed arguments are jquery objects
[10:11:36] <skullcrasher> and only do something for them
[10:12:03] <skullcrasher> i though of something like tyepof ... === object
[10:12:11] <skullcrasher> but doesn't work :)
[10:12:29] <cjohnson> why not just fix the code to not call the event method on event code and vice versa
[10:12:46] <cjohnson> what would one function do with both an event or a jquery object
[10:14:11] <skullcrasher> err on a certain event, the function is called and some arguments are given. but the trigger of the event sends some data too, which now get passed to the function too
[10:14:44] <skullcrasher> it's like $.prox(myfunction,this,argument1,argument2) and additional the event stuff etc is passed through
[10:15:19] <cjohnson> so sometimes it's func(event, arg1, arg2) and sometimes it's func(arg1, arg2)?
[10:15:30] <cjohnson> the former happening when it's triggered by an event handler
[10:15:44] <skullcrasher> yes, its triggered by an event handler
[10:15:52] <cjohnson> just don't bind the function directly to the event handler, use a wrapper at that stage of binding
[10:15:55] <cjohnson> and don't pass the event in that case
[10:16:07] <cjohnson> that way the event handler calls a function which calls func(arg1, arg2)
[10:16:59] <cjohnson> instead of just doing .click(func), it's .click(function() { var args = arguments; args.pop(); func.apply(this, args); })
[10:17:02] <cjohnson> or something like that
[10:17:40] <cjohnson> I think I meant args.shift() though
[10:17:43] <cjohnson> to remove the first element
[10:18:08] <skullcrasher> did a wrapper :) was the fastest solution :)
[10:18:10] <skullcrasher> thx
[10:18:21] <skullcrasher> why didn't i think of that -.-
[10:18:27] <doug64k> arguments.length?
[10:18:45] <cjohnson> what about it doug64k?
[10:18:53] <skullcrasher> lenght is variable
[10:19:01] <hvyk> I’m trying to write unit tests for the plugin i’ve written.  I’m familiar with testing in java and python but can’t find anything information specific to jquery plugins.  Any suggestions?
[10:19:01] <doug64k> if it is 2 then it is a trigger that has extra data
[10:19:11] <skullcrasher> no no
[10:19:17] <cjohnson> or just fix the binding to not arbitrarily pass along the event to a function that clearly has no use for it :P
[10:19:59] <BillCriswell> nettoweb: You would need to update document and window size on resize events sadly.
[10:20:05] <skullcrasher> cjohnson, that's what i did now with wrapper for this case :)
[10:20:20] <cjohnson> skullcrasher: :)
[10:20:45] <doug64k> be happy, use .trigger. trying to shave a few microseconds off?
[10:21:07] <doug64k> I dont bother trying to directly call handlers anymore
[10:21:48] <cjohnson> no, he's using one function for two purposes I think. calling it directly, and calling it as the result of an event
[10:21:55] <hwamokp66> http://memorytree.hpcreatives.net/ How do I make the arrows in the slider invisible? I checked the images folder, css folder, and js folder and couldnt find it
[10:22:21] <cjohnson> .trigger is exactly how he's using it I expect
[10:22:29] <cjohnson> it's just that .trigger passes the event to the function
[10:22:33] <cjohnson> as well as your args
[10:23:11] <doug64k> ah ok
[10:35:49] <Kal_crunchbang> Hello their my .hide is not working http://pastebin.com/LfArxj6c
[10:38:17] <Kal_crunchbang> seems to work fine here --> http://jsfiddle.net/e1p8yy5w/2/
[10:42:50] <Bloomberg> hi
[10:42:56] <Kal_crunchbang> hi
[10:43:24] <Bloomberg> If Ihave this string "some/thing/three/two/else/more/end"
[10:43:57] <Bloomberg> How can I to remove the first 3 chains
[10:44:11] <Bloomberg> Ineed to remove the "some/thing/three" from thatstring
[10:44:13] <Kal_crunchbang> Bloomberg: its not very active at the moment and im new to jquery
[10:44:18] <Kal_crunchbang> ok
[10:44:19] <Bloomberg> how is possible?
[10:44:23] <Bloomberg> ok
[10:44:36] <Kal_crunchbang> https://www.google.co.uk/#q=jquery+replace
[10:44:45] <cjohnson> Bloomberg: well you could use regex
[10:45:03] <cjohnson> .replace(/\w+\/\w+\/\w+/, '')
[10:45:08] <Kal_crunchbang> yeah
[10:45:11] <cjohnson> .replace(/^\w+\/\w+\/\w+/, '')
[10:45:12] <cjohnson> rather
[10:45:18] <Kal_crunchbang> i was getting to that
[10:46:33] <wfq> asdfa
[10:46:40] <cjohnson> Bloomberg: alternatively, .split('/'), then shift the first 3 elements off, and rejoin
[10:51:31] <rrrosenfeld> Hello, is there someone who could help me to set up some jQuery.ajaxPrefilter to perform some caching in combination with the ifModified param and support for "done" callbacks in the promise object?
[10:52:44] <saba> Can anyone explain why offsetX and offsetY is negative values when mouse is on <text>? http://jsfiddle.net/g0bq6af6 . I catch mousemove on <svg> which works, but the <text> element causes the coordinates to be negative.
[10:53:13] <saba> One way to solve it is to add pointer-events:none on the <text>. Other ideas are welcomed though
[10:54:06] <saba> Oh, this problem is in Chrome
[10:54:16] <Kal_crunchbang> in Chrome?
[10:54:20] <Kal_crunchbang> thats strange
[10:55:44] <saba> Kal_crunchbang: yep, works in FF if one uses layerX/layerY instead of offsetX/offsetY
[10:56:21] <saba> Works in Opera.
[10:57:11] <Kal_crunchbang> thought ie would be only one with that problem
[10:57:12] <doug64k> Bloomberg: "some/thing/three/two/else/more/end".split('/').slice(3).join('/')
[10:57:19] <doug64k> s/3/2/
[10:57:27] <doug64k> s/2/3/
[10:57:40] <cjohnson> s/s/s
[10:58:04] <saba> Kal_crunchbang: haven't tested IE actually. But IE 11 is generally better with SVG than FF
[10:58:42] <Kal_crunchbang> emm..
[10:59:14] <Bloomberg> thank you guys!!
[10:59:36] <saba> Kal_crunchbang: what's your experience?
[10:59:43] <Kal_crunchbang> not good
[10:59:57] <Kal_crunchbang> FF is better
[11:00:06] <Kal_crunchbang> IE is pi**ing me off
[11:00:30] <saba> Kal_crunchbang: thing is that FF is really slow with the development of SVG. There are still fundamental functions that are available in IE 10 even, that isn't in FF
[11:00:46] <Kal_crunchbang> true
[11:00:52] <saba> talking SVG specifically, IE 11 wins. However not compared to Chrome or Opera.
[11:01:15] <Kal_crunchbang> My favourite is FF but for jQuery I use opera and chrome
[11:01:17] <doug64k> wow, you don't hear IE and better being joined grammatically very often
[11:02:13] <doug64k> IE is better that wget url --output-file=- | less    I'll give you that :P
[11:02:46] <Kal_crunchbang> I have to do coursework which includes jQuery in IE and its really annoyed me
[11:03:43] <Kal_crunchbang> so far
[11:04:42] <doug64k> Kal_crunchbang: if you are having trouble in IE and using jQuery, you can't be using much jquery
[11:05:29] <Kal_crunchbang> mainly .hide() and .show()
[11:05:48] <Kal_crunchbang> bit of .fadeout() and .fadein()
[11:06:02] <doug64k> Kal_crunchbang: syntax sugar for setting the style.display to 'none' or not
[11:06:23] <Kal_crunchbang> ...
[11:06:27] <doug64k> all that will work fine in IE
[11:07:07] <cjohnson> Kal_crunchbang: what is some code that's giving you trouble in IE?
[11:07:22] <doug64k> Kal_crunchbang: are multiple elements getting faded? it is a common mistake to setup a callback and not realize that it will get called for each animated element when it finishes
[11:08:00] <doug64k> Kal_crunchbang: if that is the issue, .promise().done(function() { .. do the finished animating code here .. })
[11:08:24] * CssN00b good morning and goodnight y'all
[11:08:28] <doug64k> Kal_crunchbang: against the selector that selects all the animated elements, ideally chained right after the .animate or fade or whatever
[11:08:36] <Kal_crunchbang> idk if its IE or my firewall but cannot access jquery api in IE and have to save locally
[11:08:47] <cjohnson> definitely has nothing to do with jquery then
[11:08:52] <cjohnson> network/server issues
[11:09:24] <cjohnson> maybe adblocker
[11:09:26] <Kal_crunchbang> no
[11:09:35] <Kal_crunchbang> works if i use FF
[11:09:42] <doug64k> Kal_crunchbang: IE loads jquery just fine. it is a bug in your page
[11:09:42] <cjohnson> that doesn't make it jquery
[11:09:57] <Kal_crunchbang> emm...
[11:10:07] <Kal_crunchbang> IDK
[11:11:11] <nomemory> I am new to jquery and I have a question. Each time I call $(somethimg) is the dom iterated (based on my selector) ?
[11:11:16] <nomemory> Or there is some sort of cache ?
[11:11:18] <doug64k> Kal_crunchbang: I think I know what you are doing... I think you are trying to test the page as a file on your drive, the browser uses file:// protocol, and your script tag src starts with "//"
[11:11:36] <Kal_crunchbang> oh
[11:11:36] <doug64k> Kal_crunchbang: try adding http: to the start of the jquery url
[11:12:00] <Kal_crunchbang> and i thought when i have to show school idk if its blocked or not
[11:12:35] <doug64k> you could copy the jquery js to your project then just src= that file
[11:12:43] <Kal_crunchbang> i did
[11:12:44] <doug64k> then it wont need the internet
[11:12:52] <ouki> bonsoir, il y a des franais ici?
[11:13:00] <doug64k> Kal_crunchbang: what is the src in the script tag that loads jquery?
[11:13:11] <Kal_crunchbang> bonsoir ??
[11:13:20] <Kal_crunchbang> sware its bonjoure
[11:13:20] <ouki> :p
[11:13:46] <ouki> J'utilise Jquery et Jquery UI
[11:13:55] <Kal_crunchbang> :P
[11:14:05] <d4rklit3> anyone know if jq validation lets you define the error message in the input?
[11:14:45] <ouki> Faut-t-il fair une manipulation spciale pour importer Jquery depuis un autre dossier?n
[11:15:03] <Kal_crunchbang> gtg

[11:24:19] <krambiorix> hi, i have a string like  123.456,78  which is a euro formatted decimal.  How can i make it a number with one decimal (rounded up) ?
[11:24:47] <doug64k> ouki: after that jquery and css stuff?
[11:25:10] <doug64k> krambiorix: Math.toFixed(1)
[11:25:30] <doug64k> oops
[11:25:43] <doug64k> it's in the Number prototype:
[11:25:46] <krambiorix> doug64k, that doesn't round it :s
[11:25:46] <doug64k> >> (10.123).toFixed(1)
[11:26:10] <krambiorix> doug64k, but i'm using  comma as a decimal separator and a dot for thousand seperator
[11:26:52] <ouki> doug64k, grrr I put the jQuery code to transform the UI tag at the beginning of the page: / By making a call to the script at the bottom of my HTML page, everything works. Thank you for your help anyway;)
[11:27:00] <doug64k> krambiorix: you are representing money using Number? Don't do that, represent it in the lowest possible unit of money, like cents
[11:27:37] <doug64k> ouki: your problem was you weren't waiting for document to be ready
[11:28:00] <doug64k> ouki: $(function() { .. this code runs when the document is ready and all of the elements exist .. })
[11:28:27] <doug64k> js> print((1.19).toFixed(1))
[11:28:30] <b-ot> doug64k: 1.2
[11:28:35] <ouki> doug64k, this is quite right. I want to go too fast and I code like a pig ^^
[11:28:36] <doug64k> js> print((1.15).toFixed(1))
[11:28:40] <b-ot> doug64k: 1.1
[11:28:54] <doug64k> js> print((1.25).toFixed(1))
[11:28:57] <b-ot> doug64k: 1.3
[11:29:06] <doug64k> looks like bankers rounding
[11:29:18] <Velveeta> interesting
[11:30:38] <doug64k> krambiorix: perhaps Math.round(n * 100) / 100
[11:30:55] <doug64k> or * / 10 for 1 digit
[11:31:45] <krambiorix> doug64k, yes, i'm trying that
[11:32:29] <doug64k> just don't be surprised if you get 10.0100000000000001 for a result when rounding :D
[11:34:51] <nezZario> eh,
[11:36:47] <cjohnson> krambiorix: make it cents instead, using whole integers
[11:36:57] <cjohnson> don't use decimals unless you need decimal math
[11:37:04] <krambiorix> k
[11:37:07] <krambiorix> thanks!
[11:37:09] <nezZario> so, if i want to set an object in motion across the page, what would be the best way to do so without killing the cpu ?
[11:37:44] <doug64k> nezZario: css animation
[11:38:07] <doug64k> nezZario: a transition on the left property of the style would do it
[11:40:53] <nezZario> eh, let me ask this way, and I think I'll get what I need... what would be the best way to emulate something like google maps where you can drag the backdrop around in a mini viewport?
[11:41:10] <nezZario> just asking for some suggestions here, I'm not really sure where to start ...
[11:41:52] <nezZario> basically i'm trying to do something similar to the style of google maps but if you drag right it keeps going right, left it keeps going left, etc...
[11:43:28] <doug64k> nezZario: http://www.jstraight.com/1172/1
[11:43:54] <doug64k> nezZario: do you mean giving it a sense of momentum?
[11:59:55] <amh345> if i have to arrays of strings a = ["1","2","3","4"]  and b = ["2","3"]   what is the best way to see if array b contains any one value from array a ?
[12:02:26] <BillCriswell> amh345: intersect
[12:02:54] <BillCriswell> Er, actually that's a bit much for that.
[12:04:47] <BillCriswell> amh345: a.some(function (n) { return b.indexOf(n) > -1; })
[12:06:31] <BillCriswell> amh345: http://jsbin.com/fanapetule/1/edit?html,js,output
[12:07:16] <cjohnson> make sure to use a shim if you need to support browsers
[12:07:31] <BillCriswell> .some should be good back to ie9
[12:07:42] <cjohnson> right
[12:07:56] <cjohnson> still gotta support IE8 in the commercial world ;)
[12:08:18] <BillCriswell> Ick.
[12:08:24] <amh345> BillCriswell: that worked perfectly.
[12:08:36] <amh345> thank you
[12:08:39] <decx> ie8 is down to sub .5% on most of my big analytics accs, so that's nice
[12:08:52] <BillCriswell> amh345: No problem.
[12:08:55] <cjohnson> yeah I'm jealous...I think it's like 15% here
[12:09:02] <decx> yikes
[12:09:18] <cjohnson> that might be 15% of IE not overall but
[12:10:10] <BillCriswell> decx: Do you use Android?
[12:10:21] <dieguezz> hi, can someone help me finish this? i am trying to highlight the link when u scroll the page http://jsfiddle.net/s8s3f9c7/2/
[12:10:39] <decx> yes
[12:11:59] <BillCriswell> decx: Did you ever use iOS? Trying to hear from smart people who switched to Droid about what kind of... issues I might run into.
[12:12:20] <decx> well i used it
[12:12:29] <decx> but never long enough to have a valid opinion
[12:12:40] <cjohnson> I had androids for about 4 years, iOS for >1yr now
[12:12:45] <BillCriswell> dieguezz: Might be better off googling "scroll spy"
[12:12:47] <cjohnson> they both suck. but they're both pretty neat.
[12:12:48] <decx> these little knick knacks only pop up after a while of use
[12:13:40] <cjohnson> google maps navigation is better in android. but siri is neat and I like how hte iOS app turns the screen off during long stretches of your trip
[12:13:50] <BillCriswell> decx: I hear ya.
[12:13:57] <BillCriswell> cjohnson: I hate Siri.
[12:14:11] <cjohnson> it saves time... you certainly don't have to use it though :P
[12:14:24] <BillCriswell> I like whatever the hell google is doing for their voice stuff.
[12:14:41] <cjohnson> there's no unified approach
[12:14:47] <cjohnson> which is problem #1 with android
[12:15:03] <cjohnson> I'm a long time linux user so I'm used to fragmentation but it gets tiring
[12:15:26] <cjohnson> still, they definitely produce some really good software
[12:16:01] <BillCriswell> cjohnson: Their iOS apps are like the only apps I use on my phone.
[12:16:13] <BillCriswell> on my iPhone*
[12:16:34] <cjohnson> airplay is very nice, though android is slowly getting there
[12:16:45] <cjohnson> android has tasker which iOS is sorely missing
[12:18:01] <cjohnson> it's really pretty random, neither is universally better. one release, iOS is leading, the next, android is leading
[12:18:03] <BillCriswell> I really like airplay when I use it, but I don't use it often enough for it to be a selling point.
[12:18:25] <cjohnson> I didn't at first but I've set it up all around my house
[12:18:38] <cjohnson> between shairport for headless linux machines, a raspberry pi airplay device
[12:18:49] <cjohnson> airfoil and some kind of airplay client for my nexus 7
[12:18:55] <cjohnson> I can beam anything to anywhere
[12:22:34] <talexb> BillCriswell, Thanks for your help earlier .. I needed to add an event handler to rcmail for its init state, and that part of it's working now. I'm on to my next problem now .. Oof.
[12:22:48] <BillCriswell> talexb: Haha, enjoy.
[12:23:24] <BillCriswell> cjohnson: Oh, is using airplay from your nexus 7 reliable?
[12:24:51] <cjohnson> yeah, there was a client I had to buy for a couple bucks. but it works nicely
[12:28:10] <BillCriswell> cjohnson: Nice.
[12:28:37] <BillCriswell> Everything else I own is Apple.. This may be like my first non-Apple technology purchase in a long ass time.
[12:28:59] <cjohnson> that's one downside then
[12:29:08] <sniperh4x0r> hey guys anyone know of an alternative js plugin that works like this one? http://razorjack.net/quicksand/
[12:29:10] <cjohnson> seems you need to be all or none, a mixed bag doesn't paly well together
[12:29:17] <cjohnson> but still, a good android phone is a solid choice
[12:29:27] <cjohnson> I'd check out the nexus
[12:29:29] <sniperh4x0r> i'm currently using this sorting JS pluging but finding that it sucks ass (sorry for words) and want to find a better one
[12:29:38] <cjohnson> nexus 7 has been fantastic tom e... a friend likes his nexus phone
[12:31:45] <BillCriswell> cjohnson: Yeah thinking the Nexus 6.
[12:31:54] <BillCriswell> Depending on how it feels in my hand.
[12:32:08] <cjohnson> hot
[12:32:10] <BillCriswell> If not I'll probably go iPhone 6 Plus.
[12:34:06] <cjohnson> I haven't checked out any of the current gen
[12:34:16] <cjohnson> my dad has a samsung s5 that's pretty sweet also
[12:34:21] <cjohnson> but I don't care for vendor shit
[12:39:11] <dieguezz> BillCriswell,  about google for scrollspy, i think that i can afford this without any library
[12:40:11] <BillCriswell> dieguezz: You could just look to see what they're doing is what I Was suggesting.
[12:41:38] <dieguezz> kk BillCriswell thanks!
[12:47:46] <_DB> hey lets say  I am checking to see how many checks are selected in a form
[12:47:51] <_DB> using this line   checkedd=document.querySelectorAll('[name="bchk[]"]:checked');
[12:48:34] <_DB> how can I grab the value of the box that is checked? im already running a if to see that only one is selected
[12:48:40] <BillCriswell> dieguezz: Now you have me thinking about how to do this most efficiently.
[12:48:52] <_DB> so I just need to grab one value
[12:53:18] <BillCriswell> _DB: $(':checked').val() would return the first checked checkboxes value.
[12:59:50] <dieguezz> lol BillCriswell  :P
[13:31:32] <d4rklit3> i can't even begin understand how jq validation doesn't have regex
[13:45:01] <Valduare> hi guys im trying to use jquery validator for this form and having hell of a time implementing it… http://jsfiddle.net/k1zeu7sr/
[13:47:54] <cjohnson> d4rklit3: you can add your own validation methods
[13:47:58] <cjohnson> so it does
[13:47:59] <d4rklit3> i know
[13:48:07] <d4rklit3> im saing it doesnt come with it
[13:48:12] <d4rklit3> like you ahve to add regex
[13:48:31] <d4rklit3> i just think it peculiar for a validation engine not to have regex validation out of the box
[13:50:43] <cjohnson> it *does*
[13:51:18] <cjohnson> http://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.addMethod/
[13:55:34] <Valduare> cjohnson: i need help with validator too  http://jsfiddle.net/k1zeu7sr/  im trying to implement it but its not working
[13:57:05] <Valduare> what did I do wrong
[13:57:27] <cjohnson> "it's not working" is not a useful statement
[13:57:48] <cjohnson> but I would guess your problem is that you are binding a submit handler inside a submit handler
[13:58:37] <Valduare> hmm
[13:58:44] <Valduare> im not too familiar with this yet :P
[13:58:48] <Valduare> whats the propper format
[13:59:59] <cjohnson> you tell me, it's your code
[14:00:10] <cjohnson> why are you binding to document.ready inside of a submitHandler?
[14:00:45] <Valduare> I had copy pasted it in from my previous code
[14:00:58] <Valduare> had it submitting fine before I started implementing validation.
[14:01:11] <cjohnson> well step #1 is to read through and understanding what you're doing before copying and pasting things blindly
[14:02:50] <Valduare> have been reading through it all. but its not making sense without the right context.
[14:08:35] <Valduare> I just want to make it not submit the form if its not valid. and then if its valid… go ahead and submit it :P
[14:09:18] <sniperh4x0r> a
[14:10:17] <Valduare> I have no background in jquery coding. need help
[14:23:35] <kingfisher64> hello, can someone instruct me what alternations I need to make to the following to get it working with bxslider. jQuery(".fadeintext").delay(1000).animate({ opacity: 1 }, 700); works once on page load but not for each image slide.
[14:24:15] <kingfisher64> it's basically to fade in text (caption) for each image slide
[14:47:17] <b-lew> does anyone know much about jquery validate?
[14:47:35] <Valduare> im having troubles too with that b-lew
[14:48:13] <b-lew> I'm trying to write a function in a required value stating if a div is visible required : true else required false
[14:48:54] <Zzaichik> You should make a working example with jsfiddle or somethin
[14:49:03] <b-lew> I'd use the hidden trick in the ignore parameter but I'm showing and hiding fields that are hidden haha... a bit confusing.
[14:49:15] <b-lew> I can make a fiddle.
[14:49:16] <cjohnson> b-lew: https://gist.github.com/orip/456034/
[14:49:41] <cjohnson> requiredIfVisible=true will make an input required if the input is visible
[14:49:47] <cjohnson> with this gist
[14:50:27] <b-lew> right but i could just use ignore if that were the case, it's built in I believe but. I'm hiding the inputs for custom styles.
[14:51:08] <cjohnson> well that would be one way of doing it, not very flexible
[14:51:19] <cjohnson> wouldn't give you per-field control
[14:51:39] <b-lew> so my checkboxes and radios are hidden. therefore those aren't validated when ignoring hidden fields.
[14:52:00] <cjohnson> right, that's one inflexible way of doing that
[14:52:10] <cjohnson> but what's your question?
[14:54:06] <b-lew> I have a div that shows and hides part of my form. so when it's hidden i want to ignore those inputs and not validate them. but when div is shown I want the inputs to validate.. but the kicker is my checkboxes and inputs are hidden for custom styles so when the div is shown the inputs are still hidden.
[14:54:13] <b-lew> I hope that makes a little senese.
[14:54:15] <b-lew> hard to explain.
[14:55:07] <cjohnson> ignore: ':hidden' doesn't care about the containing div
[14:55:10] <cjohnson> if the input is hidden, it's ignored
[14:56:07] <cjohnson> b-lew: http://jsfiddle.net/0wtj7h80/
[14:57:33] <b-lew> right, so when the containing div is shown my radios and checkboxes aren't getting validated.
[14:57:38] <b-lew> that's the issue.
[14:58:00] <cjohnson> that sounds horrific
[14:58:04] <cjohnson> why are you validating hidden inputs?
[14:58:55] <b-lew> the inputs are hidden because they wanted them "styled" custom... i'm pulling my hair out... very horrific.
[14:59:16] <cjohnson> oooh you replace them with some other kind of input
[14:59:25] <b-lew> I was thinking about trying this.
[14:59:25] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/seLfcbjo/
[14:59:27] <cjohnson> have you tried just styling the elements themselves?
[14:59:35] <cjohnson> CSS lets you do a lot with checkboxes
[14:59:46] <b-lew> yea, this was styled by another dev.
[15:00:01] <cjohnson> well tell them to fix their shit to not be so shitty :P
[15:00:05] <b-lew> I told him I would haven't styled these inputs like this...
[15:00:06] <b-lew> lol
[15:00:11] <b-lew> that's awesome
[15:00:16] <cjohnson> what about removing :hidden from the ignore
[15:00:21] <cjohnson> and just validaitng all inputs
[15:00:31] <mtchllbrrn> I need help filtering a selector:   From all elements $('[*=-key]'), I need to select the elements with .val() == 'foo'
[15:00:45] <cjohnson> you could do that b-lew but it would be better to add it as a method instead of defining it per-field like that
[15:00:47] <b-lew> thats what I am doing... I now have ignore:[],
[15:01:03] <cjohnson> mtchllbrrn: [val=foo] will match that
[15:01:13] <cjohnson> b-lew: so then the checkboxes should be getting correctly validated right
[15:01:28] <cjohnson> mtchllbrrn: sorry, value=foo
[15:01:32] <b-lew> Well you can write a function for the required value I think. So my thought is to write a function and call it into the reqired value
[15:01:38] <cjohnson> that won't work for <select> though
[15:01:39] <b-lew> right
[15:02:02] <cjohnson> b-lew: no I'm askin what the problem you're solving is. if you made ignore empty, it should already be validating those checkboxes
[15:02:09] <cjohnson> don't you want them to be validated?
[15:02:12] <mtchllbrrn> cjohnson, how do I go about specifying both [id*=-key] and [val=foo]?
[15:02:49] <b-lew> well the containing div is a show/hide div so I'm doing this... required : "#field:checked"
[15:02:50] <mtchllbrrn> i.e. Selecting only those elements with [id*=-key] and [val=foo]?
[15:03:16] <cjohnson> mtchllbrrn: http://jsfiddle.net/g16vv9jz/
[15:03:33] <cjohnson> b-lew: I see. I would make it use a different rule for that problem
[15:03:43] <cjohnson> requiredIfContainerVisible
[15:03:48] <cjohnson> and borrow the code from the gist I gave you
[15:04:05] <cjohnson> and make it look for the parent div .is(':visible') instead of $this.is(':visible')
[15:04:13] <cjohnson> instead of trying to specify it on a per-field basis
[15:04:15] <b-lew> that's what I need, required if container is visible.
[15:04:24] <cjohnson> okay sweet, there you go then
[15:05:36] <mtchllbrrn> cjohnson, thanks so much, that worked
[15:06:17] <cjohnson> b-lew: line 10, you would change that to look up the ancestor of e that you want to see is visible, instead of just checking if e and all its parents are visible
[15:07:53] <b-lew> .parent?
[15:07:59] <b-lew> .parent()
[15:08:13] <cjohnson> well, if the <div> you want to check is the direct parent of the input, yes
[15:08:21] <cjohnson> it's up to your layout
[15:08:48] <b-lew> 3 levels.
[15:08:55] <cjohnson> I would maybe put some kind of class or data attribute on the ancestor you want to check is visible and then find .closest('[data-attr=whatever]') to be explicit
[15:09:00] <b-lew> so .parent().parent().parent()
[15:09:05] <cjohnson> I wouldn't just do .parent().parent().parent()
[15:09:20] <b-lew> yea that's a bad idea.
[15:09:23] <b-lew> my brain hurts.
[15:09:34] <cjohnson> put the data attr on the ancestor, there's nothing for your brain to hurt over
[15:09:38] <cjohnson> I just gave you the answer :P
[15:10:42] <MarcGuay> serialize() is giving me an encoded string like so "cart%5B69%5D%5Bqty%5D=1&cart%5B70%5D%5Bqty%5D=3", is this normal?
[15:10:58] <b-lew> yea, I'm unsure if I'm following it correctly but I'll put the data attr on there and go step by step
[15:11:15] <cjohnson> b-lew: http://jsfiddle.net/u5uhq13d/  for instance
[15:11:40] <theshit123> hi, i am taking a site with $.get and i want to access to elements from this site so i am parsing the html for this, i am using right now $.parseHtml(data) but i dont know how can i now select divs from this object.
[15:11:45] <cjohnson> if you were to put data-input-ancestor="true" on the div you want to test visibility for
[15:12:11] <cjohnson> MarcGuay: http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[15:12:35] <b-lew> adding it now.
[15:12:40] <MarcGuay> cjohnson: According to that it's "no".
[15:12:51] <MarcGuay> Any idea why that could be happening?  I'm just dumping to console.log.
[15:12:56] <cjohnson> did you even read it?
[15:13:00] <MarcGuay> cjohnson: I did
[15:13:05] <cjohnson> the very first sentence
[15:13:07] <cjohnson> The .serialize() method creates a text string in standard URL-encoded notation.
[15:13:08] <MarcGuay> And I looked at the example as well.
[15:14:28] <b-lew> like this cjohnson http://jsfiddle.net/u5uhq13d/2/
[15:14:28] <b-lew> ?
[15:15:06] <cjohnson> yeah except I would rename it from requiredIfVisible
[15:15:12] <MarcGuay> cjohnson: Any idea why in the example it's not encoded?
[15:15:22] <cjohnson> MarcGuay: it's printed to the page
[15:15:28] <cjohnson> the browser interprets the encoding
[15:15:53] <cjohnson> b-lew: make it like requiredIfAncestorVisible, then set requiredIfAncestorVisible="true" on an input inside that div, and I believe it should work
[15:16:31] <b-lew> I'd put requiredIfAncestorVisible: true on the rule right?
[15:17:18] <cjohnson> ah yeah if you're not defining the rules on the HTML itself
[15:17:50] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/u5uhq13d/3/
[15:17:56] <b-lew> I added some example html
[15:18:28] <cjohnson> hrm, looks about right. however, I'm not sure required and radio buttons make sense
[15:18:59] <b-lew> that's tied to some JS my co-worker wrote.
[15:19:07] <b-lew> I'll test this and see what happens.
[15:19:37] <cjohnson> right I'm just saying, think about it
[15:19:43] <cjohnson> you can't have two radios with the same name be checked
[15:19:51] <cjohnson> so required is going to fail on one or the other
[15:20:32] <b-lew> Oh I agree.. my co-workers co workers code is crazy which is why my brain hurts.
[15:20:34] <cjohnson> oh wait nevermind if you define the rule in JS you can specify it per-name
[15:20:36] <cjohnson> instead of per-input
[15:21:46] <b-lew> would I do this?
[15:21:47] <b-lew> "field28497342" : { requiredIfAncestorVisible: true },
[15:22:12] <cjohnson> yep
[15:22:32] <cjohnson> also remove required="required" on the radios
[15:24:43] <b-lew> I think that worked... testing.
[15:29:34] <Zak> is there a way to find out if a form fails to submit using jquery?
[15:29:58] <keady__> hmmm
[15:30:00] <Zak> (without manually sending the form and using ajx)
[15:30:03] <Zak> *ajax
[15:30:41] <keady__> looking for a hidden input with specific value. should i add value attribute to my selector or filter() on hidden input?
[15:42:47] <cjohnson> Zak: what does "fails to submit" mean?
[15:43:39] <cjohnson> keady__: can you use a name or id lookup instead? that would be more explicit
[15:43:45] <cjohnson> if not, it's arbitrary
[15:45:16] <keady__> yeah i was gonna do either $("[name='whatev'][value='theval']) oooor $("[name='whatev']").filter( function() { return this.value == 'theval'; } )
[15:45:17] <keady__> yannoz
[15:45:23] <keady__> give-or-take
[15:45:57] <cjohnson> not too much different
[15:46:17] <cjohnson> the name should be pretty unique though, no? just lookup via name
[15:48:22] <toothe> I'm having trouble adding arbitrary HTML data to my document.
[15:48:29] <toothe> http://dpaste.com/3EC2TKJ
[15:48:30] <Zak> cjohnson: yeah, sorry my question isn't clear. I'm talking mostly about when the server errors, or fails to respond.
[15:48:48] <cjohnson> if it's an ajax request, it should call the error method
[15:48:50] <Zak> I'm fairly sure it's not possible unless you override the default submit and handle it yourself
[15:48:52] <toothe> I am trying to clone a certain div area, and then add it to the document - ideally immediately afterwards.
[15:49:04] <cjohnson> if it's just a standard form post, then obviously that has nothing to do with javascript or jquery
[15:49:13] <Zak> e.g. if the form is a POST, you can'st just do $('form').on('error', function (
[15:49:22] <cjohnson> right of course
[15:49:45] <toothe> I tried to do $componentforms.find(':last').clone().appendTo($componentforms) <-- no dice.
[15:49:46] <Zak> sorry, a bit tired. After I thought it through, i realized that you would have to use ajax.
[15:50:04] <cjohnson> toothe: what about it isn't working?
[15:51:03] <cjohnson> toothe: http://jsfiddle.net/26mces4t/
[15:51:14] <toothe> its not adding to the document.
[15:51:24] <cjohnson> what specifically isn't working
[15:51:41] <cjohnson> I just demonstrated that line of code works fine, so we need to figure out where your real problem is
[15:51:58] <toothe> I think I have have based my code off you, btw
[15:52:39] <toothe> so i am trying to clone a certain <div> and append it to the end of the table.
[15:52:48] <cjohnson> that's improper HTML
[15:52:51] <toothe> so, I'm not certian if the selection is done properly.
[15:52:52] <toothe> oh?
[15:52:56] <cjohnson> the only thing inside of a table should be a thead or tbody
[15:53:02] <cjohnson> or a tr if you want to let the browser imply the tbody
[15:53:06] <cjohnson> a div doesn't go inside a table
[15:53:17] <toothe> im using <div> to tell jquery where to append
[15:53:19] <toothe> otherwise, I"m fine.
[15:53:26] <cjohnson> doesn't matter, div doesn't go into <table>
[15:53:33] <cjohnson> use <tbody> to make sections of rows
[15:53:36] <cjohnson> you can have multiple
[15:54:24] <cjohnson> but either way, the jsfiddle link I just gave you shows that the line of code in question works just fine
[15:54:27] <cjohnson> it duplicates the last li in the ul
[15:55:07] <toothe> right...let me think a bit
[15:55:12] <toothe> and hack at this and use your example...
[15:55:19] <toothe> im new to jquery, so what might e obvious to you isn't obvious to me..
[15:55:58] <cjohnson> you seem to get the jquery bit just fine
[15:56:15] <cjohnson> another thing to consider: you do realize the last <tr> insdie your table is the addComponent button itself right?
[15:56:25] <cjohnson> you're duplicating that row
[16:08:19] <toothe> cjohnson: so, are you saying I need to duplicate a tbody ?
[16:08:44] <cjohnson> no I'm just saying that I don't think you want tr:last
[16:08:57] <cjohnson> but if you want to make groups of <tr>s, the correct way is a tbody
[16:09:31] <toothe> yes, I get that part...but then what do I search for?
[16:10:11] <cjohnson> I'm not sure, I don't know what you're trying to do
[16:10:28] <cjohnson> I'm just letting you know that tr:last is going tom atch the row with the add component button in it
[16:23:58] <snowinferno|work> Hi all, I'm attaching a listener using $().submit but not able to prevent the form from actually getting submitted. I'm using both event.preventDefault and return false to no avail. The goal is to make an ajax call complete before the form is submitted to the server to ensure it completes before moving along.
[16:26:49] <cjohnson> snowinferno|work: paste your code
[16:28:27] <snowinferno|work> cjohnson: http://pastie.org/9733510
[16:29:17] <snowinferno|work> The page refreshes with this code but i never see the ajax request from analytics.track
[16:29:31] <cjohnson> yeah, your use of $('form')[0] seems bad and confusing, but that should work fine
[16:29:55] <cjohnson> if the form is still submitting, my guess is you have a JS error, or you're not correctly binding the event handler to the form
[16:30:04] <cjohnson> ie the form isn't created until after this code runs
[16:30:35] <snowinferno|work> cjohnson: yeah, i didn't feel like adding an id to the form at the time. The code is the very last thing in the body, I'll try wrapping it in $(document).ready and if that fails assign it an id directly
[16:31:47] <cjohnson> well you should assign it an ID either way, but that has nothing to do with it
[16:32:11] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/6sjjw5uh/ vs http://jsfiddle.net/6sjjw5uh/1/
[16:32:18] <cjohnson> the former captures the event, the latter doesn't
[16:33:05] <snowinferno|work> yeah, the order of the form and script are as the former example
[16:33:31] <cjohnson> then I'd look for a JS error or make sure your selector is finding the right form
[16:33:39] <cjohnson> which is why $('form')[0] is so bad
[16:33:41] <snowinferno|work> is it better form to use $().on('submit'... ); than $().submit(...)?
[16:33:58] <cjohnson> not really
[16:34:10] <cjohnson> just easier to manage with .on
[16:34:25] <cjohnson> for instance if I wanted to bind to an input's onchange event, and later also wanted to bind the same handler to onkeypress
[16:34:34] <cjohnson> I could just make it .on('change keypress') with .on
[16:34:43] <snowinferno|work> the browser isn't reporting any js errors, I wonder if it's because i'm accessing via localhost instead of a web address
[16:34:54] <snowinferno|work> that's awesome, I wasn't aware that was a possibility!
[16:35:03] <cjohnson> localhost as in actual localhost, or localhost as in file:// ?
[16:35:22] <snowinferno|work> http://localhost:5000
[16:35:51] <cjohnson> yeah, that's fine then
[16:36:05] <cjohnson> to the browser that's no different than a remote web server
[16:36:43] <snowinferno|work> I've seen some odd behavior due to using http://localhost before, don't remember what the actual scenario was at the time though
[16:37:09] <cjohnson> not relevant here I don't think. try adding the ID
[16:37:13] <cjohnson> and the document.ready
[16:39:00] <snowinferno|work> did that, with both, removed the #btn-login click listener and it appears to be making the ajax call. Now if I want to submit the form in the callback, would $(this).submit($(this), function(){...}): cause the form to be submitted?
[16:39:52] <cjohnson> $formNode.submit() is how you would make the form submit
[16:40:03] <cjohnson> if this happens to be the form node, then this.submit()
[16:41:36] <snowinferno|work> heh kind of concerned it might generate recursion into the submit listener
[16:42:52] <cjohnson> if you want to be safe, $formNode.get(0).submit()
[16:43:00] <cjohnson> that calls the native browser submit method, which bypasses teh submit handler
[16:43:36] <snowinferno|work> ahh, thanks! I was just about to let you know the ajax is definitely happening but it wasn't actually sending me on my merry way.
[16:44:55] <tejas-manohar> hey
[16:45:08] <tejas-manohar> how do i listen for change in background-color on an element?
[16:45:43] <tejas-manohar> i wanna run some code everything this happens
[16:46:00] <cjohnson> tejas-manohar: you could listen to whatever event triggers the background change
[16:46:43] <tejas-manohar> oh hmmm
[17:06:02] <snowinferno|work> cjohnson: I tried to update your fiddle example to submit the form but it isn't actually submitting: http://jsfiddle.net/kL0xon5s/1/, I never get the alert that it's submitting
[17:06:53] <cjohnson> got your args backward
[17:06:55] <cjohnson> for setTimeout
[17:06:59] <cjohnson> setTimeout(func, time)
[17:07:18] <cjohnson> though now that I see it your way I kind of like that more
[17:07:48] <snowinferno|work> ahh, good point lol I've been in node so much that I'm just used to providing a callback last
[17:08:10] <snowinferno|work> I see the alert but the fiddle doesn't go to google.com
[17:08:22] <cjohnson> yeah that's jsfiddle doing some magic
[17:08:27] <cjohnson> to keep you going to external pages
[17:08:30] <snowinferno|work> ahhh interesting
[17:08:42] <cjohnson> I didn't know what else to use for the action that would work in a fiddle
[17:09:24] <snowinferno|work> I hear you, that's why i went with setTimeout to make like it was an ajax call coming back
[17:10:11] <cjohnson> yep exactly
[17:10:24] <cjohnson> I kind of wish they would shim in some fake stuff because there are times where I want to demonstrate ajax things in jsfiddle
[17:10:38] <cjohnson> I can use setTimeout but a beginning isn't going to see the parallel
[17:10:42] <cjohnson> beginner*
[17:11:38] <snowinferno|work> no kidding, it wouldn't be too difficult with a Node module I've seen (can't recall the name of it right now) to do that but the question is would it work in a browser in a similar fashion
[17:12:31] <cjohnson> even if jsfiddle just had a dumb /echo URL that dumped back whatever you sent to it
[17:12:41] <cjohnson> maybe with a param to adjust how long it would take to respond
[17:13:03] <shoky> jsfiddle does have echo services
[17:13:23] <BillCriswell> /echo/html I think... not sure what HTML it sends?
[17:13:56] <shoky> /echo/json/  /echo/html/   you gotta POST to them with data param 'json' or 'html' with your json/html data to echo back
[17:14:00] <cjohnson> oh interesting
[17:14:19] <cjohnson> now if I could also adjust how long it takes to respond that would be perfect :P
[17:14:26] <shoky> "timeout" param :P
[17:14:33] <cjohnson> no shit?
[17:14:34] <shoky> it's in seconds i think
[17:14:40] <cjohnson> you're beautiful
[17:14:41] <jeremy-_> Anybody know if theres a way to call JqueryUI's autocomplete Change event on select instead of blur? It seems like the only way to do it would be to use the select event instead then just check the before/after values yourself
[17:14:50] <snowinferno|work> it's still not functioning the way I expect it to, i'll have to table it for now and move on to more pressing things. Thanks for your insight cjohnson!
[17:15:00] <cjohnson> snowinferno|work: no prob
[17:16:29] <shoky> cjohnson sorry it's delay, not timeout
[17:16:33] <shoky> http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html
[17:17:37] <cjohnson> that's fantastic, bookmarking this page
[17:21:05] <jeremy-_> Ahh, i found a hack for autocomplete. I had initially tried $(this).blur(); on select event to call the change event which wasnt working. But you use the close event rather than select event and it triggers change fine
[17:24:09] <rubyonrailed> Does anyone have a tutorial on setting up a back function with jquery tabs
[17:26:19] <cjohnson> rubyonrailed: here's some code I wrote to make Bootstrap tabs work with jquery address plugin: http://pastie.org/private/emiucr2cbpbt238cgb3opg
[17:26:26] <cjohnson> you could borrow from that
[17:26:53] <rubyonrailed> cjohnson Thank you
[17:31:52] <z1haze> can anyone help me with sorting portfolio items in isotope? i want to randomly sort them
[17:37:36] <domino14> I'm super confused. I have code that does the following: $.ajax({'url': '/lt/widget/123', 'type': 'PUT'}) and the console tells me: The page at 'https://example.com/app/' was loaded over HTTPS, but ran insecure content from 'http://example.com/lt/widget/123/': this content should also be loaded over HTTPS.
[17:38:09] <domino14> My nginx config has forwardign set up; if you do curl -vvv http://example.com/lt/widget/123/ it shows a redirect to https://example.com/lt/widget/123/
[17:38:24] <domino14> why is jQuery not following this redirect? It also works for all other URLs i've tried! :(
[17:39:03] <shoky> doubt it has to do with jquery
[17:39:33] <jeremy-_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13556772/jquery-ajax-wont-make-https-requests
[17:39:37] <jeremy-_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15375908/ajax-get-request-over-https
[17:39:47] <jeremy-_> probably one of those, IMO the former with redirect from missing trailing slash
[17:40:34] <domino14> I do an ajax request to /lt/abc/123 and that one properly redirects to https
[17:40:40] <domino14> why would the path /lt/widget be broken?
[17:41:24] <domino14> right, I can add the trailing slash, and it works, but even without the trailing slash it should work, and it does work for all other URLs. i dont' want to blanket add a trailing slash there and not add it elsewhere
[17:41:29] <domino14> because i have no idea why it's broken for just this particular URL
[17:41:41] <domino14> like if i do /lt/widget/123/ that works fine
[17:42:00] <domino14> but any path should work fine, my nginx config is forwarding everything correctly, except for /lt/widget/123 ??
[17:42:04] <shoky> what about curl without the slash
[17:42:22] <domino14> right, when i do curl http://example.com/lt/widget/123 it eventually ends up redirecting to https, with the trailing slash
[17:42:28] <domino14> just not in jQuery
[17:44:12] <shoky> you're on https:// page and doing $.ajax({'url': '/lt/widget/123'..    with a relative url, and it tries to load http not https?
[17:45:16] <domino14> check out the redirect loop
[17:45:18] <domino14> yes, it's bizarre
[17:45:20] <domino14> http://dpaste.com/0VVZSB4
[17:46:11] <shoky> more interested in curl on https without slash
[17:46:27] <shoky> on https://../lt/widget/123
[17:46:28] <domino14> you can see the whole sequence there, it's stupid, but it's like
[17:47:00] <domino14> http no slash -> https no slash -> http slash -> https slash
[17:47:11] <shoky> well
[17:47:17] <shoky> so https without slash redirects to http
[17:47:23] <shoky> so your browser doesn't like that
[17:47:26] <shoky> makes sense
[17:47:48] <shoky> either put the slash there, or make sure your backend doesn't redirect to http
[17:47:56] <p0wr> how do i know if ANY textbox/textarea has focus ?
[17:48:10] <domino14> well the weird thing is that I can do http://example.com/lt/something_else/12345 and that works fine
[17:48:17] <domino14> so my browser doesn't like the redirect for some urls?
[17:48:24] <shoky> what does "do" mean?
[17:49:13] <domino14> sorry - I can do an ajax post to '/lt/something_else/12345' where something_else is another path in my API
[17:49:42] <domino14> like i've been doing this forever, and it suddenly decided to break for /lt/widget/123
[17:49:53] <shoky> p0wr: $(document.activeElement).is(':text')
[17:50:14] <domino14> yet still works for other paths that have the same structure
[17:50:20] <shoky> domino14: my guess is that the other url doesn't redirect to http
[17:50:51] <domino14> hmmmm
[17:50:54] <domino14> let me take a look
[17:52:13] <domino14> yeah the url handler on the backend looks different for these other URLs. ugh. what a disaster. why is my backend redirecting https to http
[17:53:41] <theshit123> Hi, i have a text with an humanized time, something like: "12 hours" , "8 minutes", "1 hour", "1 week", etc, and i want to transform this in a date object to work with it, jquery give some functionality for this or just i made it?
[17:55:21] <shoky> jquery won't help you there
[17:55:52] <theshit123> then i will make my function to transform it
[17:57:02] <shoky> enjoy
[17:59:23] <Terminus> hi. terribly stupid question, why isn't slideUp working? -> http://jsfiddle.net/nma31ktz/
[18:00:39] <Terminus> nevermind. for some reason, hide() and show() are undefined. >_<
[18:01:28] <shoky> Terminus: because jsfiddle put your code inside a function so your hide/show functions aren't global. don't use inline javascript in your html
[18:01:42] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/nma31ktz/1/
[18:05:11] <Terminus> shoky: yep. i just did the same thing. =)
[18:12:53] <kinesis> there's something about this masonry layout that's not working on my blog. it miscalculates when rating-widget.com's plugin loads, it miscalculates on a certain post. the post comes too long and overlaps.. the div grid comes too long and overlaps
[18:16:35] <kinesis> why would this happen?
[18:19:48] <kinesis> jquery document.ready not firing after ajax
[18:21:11] <toothe> cjohnson: are you present?
[18:22:43] <toothe> i thought I got this...and....I don't.
[18:22:55] <toothe> I'm having trouble copying an arbitrarily number of rows.
[18:25:35] <shoky> make a jsfiddle
[18:29:38] <toothe> here is a proof of concept: http://jsfiddle.net/zh0nko3s/
[18:29:42] <toothe> I overly simplified it, of course
[18:29:52] <toothe> basically, I want to clone the two input fields below.
[18:32:15] <shoky> clone the input fields? or the <tr>s?  and do what with the clones. and what specifies which should be cloned
[18:32:21] <shoky> and when should it happen
[18:32:22] <toothe> I suppose the entire TR
[18:32:28] <toothe> because I want it to be part of the table.
[18:32:47] <toothe> so, I want to add a few more <tr><td><input type=text....</td></tr>
[18:32:51] <toothe> both of them twice or so
[18:33:12] <toothe> now I presume I need to identify them, then do .clone(), then appendTo(location)
[18:33:57] <shoky> if "them" means the <tr>s, and location is a <tbody>, then yeah
[18:34:36] <toothe> yes the two tr's
[18:34:47] <toothe> but, I can't seem to get the code working exactly...
[18:34:59] <toothe> one sec, checking on my elderly mom...
[18:36:09] <toothe> she's good so I'm back
[18:39:21] <toothe> shoky: do you see what's up?
[18:39:33] <toothe> or understand my issue? I can't figure out how to identify the range and how to identify where to place it.
[18:39:58] <cjohnson> depends what defines the range
[18:40:02] <cjohnson> your proof of concept is vague
[18:40:04] <shoky> toothe: you didn't explain how ^
[18:40:05] <cjohnson> what indicates the stop row
[18:40:35] <toothe> so, in that simplified example, I want to capture two <tr>'s worth of objects.
[18:40:46] <cjohnson> right, but what indicates the starting tr and what indicates the stopping tr
[18:40:49] <shoky> you dont want us to just help you solve this simplified example though
[18:40:56] <toothe> (that was just an example, btw, my real world example has maybe 20 rows.
[18:41:12] <cjohnson> always start on tr #3? always on the first row with an input in it?
[18:41:13] <toothe> cjohnson: right. So, should I do like "id=cloneme" ?
[18:41:17] <shoky> you need to mark the range, e.g. with a class
[18:41:20] <shoky> classes
[18:41:23] <cjohnson> sure, but then what indicates the stopping row toothe?
[18:41:40] <toothe> same at the end. id="NoMoreCloningAfterMe"
[18:41:42] <shoky> also when should they be cloned
[18:41:49] <toothe> I'm asking, is that the way its done?
[18:42:02] <cjohnson> it's hard to say, depends what your real world use case is
[18:42:12] <cjohnson> try pasting some real code
[18:42:41] <cjohnson> based on what you have so far I might go with data-clone="start" and data-clone="stop" on the TRs
[18:42:54] <cjohnson> but then again, maybe you just want the 2 rows following the start...
[18:43:24] <toothe> sure, let me get my real example here...a moment.
[18:43:39] <toothe> btw, I would have done this earlier, but I"m my mom's driver :_)
[18:43:40] <toothe> :-)
[18:44:09] <shoky> stupid example  http://jsfiddle.net/zh0nko3s/1/
[18:44:48] <toothe> this is my actual page, i would be cloning from line 95 to 137: http://dpaste.com/0KVVT9B
[18:45:23] <shoky> uh you have  an <input> there outside of any <tr><td>
[18:45:30] <shoky> line 93
[18:45:57] <toothe> yes, that's a hidden field.
[18:46:05] <toothe> improper HTML?
[18:46:09] <shoky> ok. it's still not in any <tr>
[18:46:09] <shoky> yes
[18:46:17] <toothe> okay, i'll be sure to move it.
[18:46:31] <toothe> let me do that afterwards so I don't ruin the line count.
[18:46:40] <cjohnson> as I said earlier, the _only_ thing inside a table should be a tbody/thead, or a tr if you're leaving it up toe the browser to imply tbody
[18:46:50] <shoky> anyway i made you a stupid example based on the vague stuff you said you wanted
[18:47:32] <cjohnson> interesting, didn't know closest worked on collections
[18:47:37] <cjohnson> that's neat
[18:47:54] <toothe> let me check it..
[18:48:11] <shoky> yea, most traversing methods like .closest .find do
[18:49:06] <toothe> shoky: did you send me the right version?
[18:49:15] <toothe> this doesn't look...complete...
[18:49:19] <cjohnson> it is
[18:49:19] <shoky> toothe: this one http://jsfiddle.net/zh0nko3s/1/
[18:49:42] <cjohnson> it finds all inputs with a class=clone and then clones their containing <tr> to the end of the table
[18:49:54] <cjohnson> whenever one of them is clicked
[18:50:02] <chx> hi. if i added something with $(selector).after('foo')  then how can i replace later foo with bar (using the same selector, foo might not have a selector) ?
[18:50:14] <cjohnson> chx: save $(selector) to a varaible
[18:50:22] <chx> and then?
[18:50:26] <cjohnson> and then $savedSelector.after(bar)
[18:50:30] <shoky> or save foo to a variable
[18:50:35] <chx> wont that create barfoo?
[18:50:36] <shoky> and foo.replaceWith(bar)
[18:50:46] <cjohnson> oh smert
[18:50:58] <cjohnson> assuming foo is a jqueyr object
[18:50:59] <chx> foo might be just some html...?
[18:51:00] <shoky> assuming foo is a jquery object
[18:51:01] <shoky> hah
[18:51:04] <toothe> shoky: so, I don't see a link that executes the function in question.
[18:51:06] <cjohnson> :P
[18:51:09] <toothe> like, it doesn't copy for me.
[18:51:13] <chx> well i could mkae it $('foo') i guess
[18:51:19] <cjohnson> toothe: click one of hte inputs themselves
[18:51:21] <toothe> and, it appends to tbody, but there is no tbody class here.
[18:51:32] <cjohnson> line 2 binds it to click handler of .clone
[18:51:35] <toothe> oh...
[18:51:36] <cjohnson> which are the inputs
[18:51:45] <shoky> toothe: there is an implicit tbody which the browser adds to your bad html ;)
[18:52:04] <toothe> lol, i've never used tbody. I just use <table> and tr's and td's
[18:52:07] <shoky> and you're right, you should add the tbody yourself
[18:52:12] <toothe> are we supposed to use tbody? I"ve never used it.
[18:52:15] <cjohnson> <table><tr><td></td></tr></table> is actually <table><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
[18:52:23] <cjohnson> browsers have supported people omitting it forever
[18:52:24] <toothe> what is the purpose of tbody?
[18:52:33] <cjohnson> it defines a grouping of rows. there's also thead
[18:52:54] <cjohnson> earlier when you were trying to wrap a <div> around <tr> that's where tbody should have been used
[18:53:57] <toothe> i must say, I find this hard.
[18:54:03] <toothe> then again, I learned HTML in the 6th grade
[18:54:07] <cjohnson> your mom said that too
[18:54:11] * cjohnson bows
[18:54:14] <cjohnson> I'll be here all week
[18:54:55] <cjohnson> toothe: so you still haven't defined the behavior for your cloning algorithm. what indicates the last tr you want to clone?
[18:55:01] <cjohnson> why is line 134 the last one?
[18:55:25] <cjohnson> er 137, whichever
[18:55:37] <cjohnson> how does the code know to stop there?
[18:55:56] <cjohnson> this is probably where a <tbody> will come in use
[18:56:24] <toothe> whoa, got it working.
[18:56:41] <toothe> cjohnson: i suppose based on an ID?
[18:56:58] <cjohnson> I want to know the actual thought process
[18:57:01] <toothe> but based on the example shoky gave me, I can just add them all to an initial class.
[18:57:10] <toothe> so, class="cloneme" and specify based on that.
[18:57:23] <cjohnson> hrm, if it works for you, no sense pursuing any further I guess
[18:57:35] <toothe> is that not a good way of doing it?
[18:57:36] <shoky> tho i doubt you want them to clone in an exponential rate like in my fiddle ;D
[18:57:40] <kinesis> whenever ajax appears in my document it appears that msnry.layout() needs to be called. How can I pull this off?
[18:57:53] <kinesis> or whenever certain things appear.. rather
[18:58:01] <toothe> i also need to learn this tbody craziness...
[18:58:05] <cjohnson> toothe: I still haven't figured out what you want to do
[18:58:08] <slavka`> hey guys... got more of a general question... ive been working at this company about 4 years... full time but last 2 have not had a pay raise... would moving to a 6 month contract position with a 20% pay raise be a good idea or too risky?
[18:58:14] <cjohnson> so I can't say if that's a good way of doing it
[18:58:15] <toothe> cjohnson: I think I got it...I can show you what I"m doing.
[18:58:27] <toothe> http://jsfiddle.net/zh0nko3s/3/
[18:58:30] <toothe> This is prety much what I Want.
[18:58:51] <cjohnson> slavka`: hard to say, you have to decide. things to consider: will you get the same benefits?
[18:59:25] <cjohnson> also, would you actually be a contractor? the IRS will tax you as a 1099 employee even if your boss calls you a contractor if your're still operating like an employee
[18:59:51] <cjohnson> general test is if you have to be there for certain hours or if your boss gets to tell you how to do your job, you're not a contractor
[19:00:07] <cjohnson> w2 employee**
[19:00:13] <toothe> also going to have to make the name of the form increment by 1, but one step at a time I guess.
[19:01:00] <cjohnson> seems a little messy but if it does the job that's good
[19:01:19] <toothe> is it? you're taling to a newb who wants to use best practice...but doesn't nkow what it is.
[19:01:54] <cjohnson> if you ever lose reference to that trs variable you would not be able to re-clone the correct elements
[19:02:27] <cjohnson> let me type up the approach I was thinking earlier
[19:02:41] <toothe> wouldn't I just have the class all be something?
[19:02:46] <toothe> but sure...
[19:03:14] <cjohnson> as you can tell by commenting out the var trs line, re-using that selector will grow the clone list exponentially
[19:03:26] <cjohnson> the only way to clone the original list is to keep the trs variable around forever
[19:03:38] <toothe> right, so in my version I grab the trs once.
[19:03:43] <toothe> and reuse that same variable instead of redoing it.
[19:04:21] <cjohnson> right that's what I'm saying. if you lose that variable, it stops working. slightly inflexible
[19:04:26] <cjohnson> depends on teh scope of the code
[19:07:15] <toothe> man, im going to have to go back and add those HTML elements tbody and such into my code..this'll take a while
[19:08:22] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/5u6wteey/
[19:08:23] <cjohnson> something like this
[19:09:56] <toothe> let me check that out.
[19:10:48] <toothe> what's the point of thead is you already have th?
[19:11:08] <cjohnson> <thead> is like <tbody> except for the heading of the table
[19:11:15] <cjohnson> <th> is like <td>
[19:11:26] <toothe> can you have multiple tbody's?
[19:11:31] <cjohnson> yep check my source
[19:11:32] <cjohnson> I have 3
[19:11:38] <toothe> oh, you do.
[19:11:40] <toothe> i see...interesting
[19:11:42] <toothe> btw, thanks a LOT
[19:11:47] <cjohnson> no prob
[19:11:53] <toothe> I find JS and jquery in specific not hard, but a little tricky to learn.
[19:13:24] <toothe> so, what's the purpose of that tag though? seems unnecessary...
[19:13:49] <cjohnson> grouping <tr>s together
[19:13:56] <toothe> ahh...okay that makes sense.
[19:13:57] <cjohnson> you could have two <tr> in the heading
[19:14:01] <toothe> yeah...
[19:14:09] <toothe> wow...i feel like my mind just expanded a bit
[19:14:44] <cjohnson> :)
[19:17:44] <toothe> interesting...
[19:17:46] <toothe> wow...
[19:17:50] <toothe> i'm kinda seriously taken aback
[19:18:12] <toothe> so, why th if there's thead?
[19:18:23] <cjohnson> http://i.ytimg.com/vi/GD6qtc2_AQA/maxresdefault.jpg
[19:18:35] <cjohnson> didn't we just go over this? hah
[19:18:42] <cjohnson> <th> is to <td> as <thead> is to <tbody>
[19:19:00] <cjohnson> it's just semantics. you could just use a standard <tbody> and <td>s at the top if you wanted
[19:19:15] <cjohnson> but CSS for example might want to take use of semantically marking up the table properly
[19:19:18] <toothe> oh, i get that...but that seems redundant.
[19:19:38] <cjohnson> which part
[19:19:45] <toothe> if you hae thead, you don't need <th>
[19:19:50] <toothe> because a tbody can have <th>
[19:20:15] <cjohnson> it can, but if you want to use semantic markup, it would make no sense for a <tbody> to have a <th>
[19:20:31] <cjohnson> like let's say you wanted to use CSS to make the heading of tables look defined
[19:20:45] <cjohnson> bold text, a black line underneath, and padding between heading and the data
[19:20:59] <cjohnson> if you just used <tbody> the CSS wouldn't know which one to give the padding to
[19:21:06] <toothe> ahh....
[19:21:56] <toothe> so, why doesn't anyone use those tags?
[19:22:02] <toothe> i feel like i've only barely heard of them
[19:22:08] <toothe> and that would contribute to my poor HTML.
[19:22:13] <toothe> there needs to be a parser that looks for such things.
[19:22:21] <cjohnson> the web is a broken place and needs to support very old code
[19:22:41] <cjohnson> so browsers will let you omit those tags because people of the past just never used them
[19:22:48] <cjohnson> now that we care more about semantic markup, they're more useful
[19:22:53] <cjohnson> but the browser still needs to support old pages
[19:23:37] <cjohnson> so it just became a situation where bad code was passed down from generation to generation and the browsers had no choice but to keep supporting it :P
[19:26:08] <cjohnson> there are html linters btw
[19:26:29] <cjohnson> I expect some of them will throw notices for missing <tbody>
[19:26:58] <toothe> linters...going to look into that
[19:27:07] <toothe> I ran some of my code through W3C's HTML validator, but it came back clean
[19:27:39] <toothe> ideally it would be a chrome add-on or something
[19:27:59] <Terminus> hello. my previous button slides divs up as expected but my next button isn't working. any ideas? -> http://jsfiddle.net/nma31ktz/3/
[19:28:47] <Terminus> or if there's a library for this where i can customize buttons, that would be awesome.
[19:29:01] <Terminus> googling hasn't shown me anything workable so far.
[19:29:57] <Terminus> wait. i think i just thought of something.
[19:30:20] <cjohnson> toothe: more ideally it would be something you run in your editor
[19:30:25] <cjohnson> or on your machine where you edit
[19:30:29] <toothe> true.
[19:30:30] <cjohnson> that's how most linters work
[19:30:31] <toothe> I use vim.
[19:30:45] <cjohnson> nice
[19:30:49] <cjohnson> best editor
[19:30:54] <cjohnson> ;P
[19:32:06] <Terminus> meh, idea failed. anybody got ideas?
[19:35:04] <toothe> does it hav ea linter?
[19:35:18] <toothe> i wonder, do most people code major websites, such as say cnn.com, using simple text editors?
[19:35:25] <toothe> or do they have programs that do it for them?
[19:36:26] <cjohnson> hard to say. I've worked with a few devs who used to work at amazon and they used vim
[19:36:58] <cjohnson> it really depends on the IT department behind the website. you could have a major site that's run by some idiot using dreamweaver
[19:37:11] <toothe> ahh...
[19:37:12] <toothe> does vim have a linter?
[19:37:13] <cjohnson> and you could have a fairly minor site that's run extremely effectively with a team of 9
[19:37:21] <toothe> right.
[19:37:30] <cjohnson> I think it will do basic HTML parsing... or there are plugins for it
[19:37:42] <cjohnson> but generally if you use vim the idea is to just have a standalone plugin to do the linting
[19:37:50] <cjohnson> standalone command line tool**
[19:38:28] <cjohnson> for instance I have a script that will compile all my JS files into one, parse them for errors, compile my SASS files into CSS, and lint everything for errors
[19:38:32] <cjohnson> but I don't generally check for HTML errors
[19:38:43] <toothe> ahh...i don't even know of any.
[19:42:28] <cjohnson> me either but google brought me here http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Cleanup_your_HTML
[19:46:06] <Terminus> pffft... i think my google fu is lacking. bxslider looks good enough for what i need.
[19:58:36] <toothe> so, only 1 thead per table...darn
[20:04:52] <cjohnson> presumably a second heading deserves a second table
[20:06:23] <toothe> hm..i suppose.
[20:30:45] <toothe> cjohnson: having trouble implementing the code you gave me.
[20:45:19] <toothe> gahhh!!!!
[20:45:22] <toothe> why can't I implement this...
[21:11:40] <phoenixz> I'm using jquery validate but I have a problem: I have a form that needs to reload after a <select> has been udpated (the form will cause a submit), but it won't submit because the validation fails since other fields are still empty.. Is there a way I can set a "pre validation" callback where I check who caused the submit? (submit caused by select? don't validate)
[21:42:32] <toothe> got it wokring!
[21:42:34] <toothe> woot!
[21:42:37] <toothe> that took me a while.

[22:22:29] <Larado> hi, looking for some suggestions and if someone can help or point me in how to do this, i need to create a interface with this shapes and settings, here is an image http://i.imgur.com/ZHDG22D.jpg
[22:23:01] <Larado> so creating the color pallete around an image like in the image and being able to click on the colors + zoom the image in the middle
[22:23:07] <Larado> which will be some upload
[22:36:27] <Oka> Larado: You might want to look into SVGs
[22:36:57] <Oka> The rest is just event handling
[22:38:25] <Larado> Oka do you know any examaples online, to make the pie sort of thing to begin with
[22:40:34] <Oka> Not really, but you could look up Inkscape tutorials

[23:07:15] <negi> in jquery
[23:09:58] <Tinker> Hi all
[23:10:32] <Tinker> We are using jQuery 1.7.2 in some of our project
[23:11:04] <negi> how can i set the position of draggable list element in jquery
[23:13:08] <negi> is there any way to set the position of draggable list element in jquery
[23:14:23] <Robdgreat> negi: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7664945/set-position-of-draggable-div
[23:15:17] <negi> no this is not work my friend
[23:15:35] <negi> any othher advice i want to make call flow sysytem
[23:18:55] <negi> how can i set the position of draggable list element in jquery
[23:19:10] <Robdgreat> I've only ever done it by dragging
[23:19:54] <negi> hello Robdgreat yes you are right but i cant make it
[23:19:57] <negi> plz help me
[23:20:12] <Robdgreat> oh, you just want to make a list draggable?
[23:20:24] <Robdgreat> I thought you wanted to move the elements programmatically
[23:20:26] <negi> i done drag and drop and also delete the list element
[23:20:44] <Robdgreat> I don't understand what it is you want to do
[23:20:46] <negi> yes i want the list elemnt programmtically
[23:20:49] <Robdgreat> ok
[23:21:52] <negi> wait a minute can i send you a code
[23:22:22] <Robdgreat> make a test case in jsfiddle
[23:22:44] <negi> ok sure
[23:27:00] <negi> http://jsfiddle.net/t57j34ks/1/
[23:27:05] <negi> this is test case
[23:28:33] <Tinker> Hi
[23:28:33] <Tinker> Hi all, We are using jQuery 1.7.2 in some of our projects. Recently we scanned those with HP Fortify and got lots of "JavaScript Hijacking: Vulnerable Framework" issues. Is this version vulnerable?
[23:29:36] <Robdgreat> Tinker: considering jquery 1.7.2 is 2-1/2 years old, there's a decent chance a lot has been fixed
[23:29:54] <Robdgreat> is there any way you can scan current again with HP Fortify?
[23:30:09] <negi> what is that
[23:30:22] <estebian> /wc/wc
[23:30:37] <Robdgreat> negi: I don't know. I was asking Tinker about HP Fortify. sorry, didn't see your link until just now
[23:30:57] <negi> ok
[23:31:06] <Cork> Tinker: as far as i know there isn't any cve for 1.7+
[23:31:33] <Cork> and one would think there would be one if it was important enough to warn about
[23:31:51] <Tinker> Cork: Yes I check in CVE. But our Fortify scanning is giving this issue
[23:31:56] <toothe> I"m trying to write a regex that matches this pattern: (?P<component)\S+)
[23:32:05] <toothe> how do I do that in JS?...I keep gettig syntax errors.
[23:32:30] <negi> hey Robdgreat plz answer
[23:32:33] <Robdgreat> negi: what is it you're trying to do?
[23:32:53] <Robdgreat> because what I thought you were doing was reordering a list
[23:32:57] <Cork> toothe: i don't think js supports look behind
[23:32:59] <Robdgreat> which would suggest Sortable
[23:33:10] <toothe> is that what its called? look behind?
[23:33:29] <Cork> <(search)
[23:33:42] <negi> actualy i want to make a call flow design ok
[23:33:48] <toothe> Cork: basically, I want to change idform0 to idform1,idform2,idform3 depending on which value it should be.
[23:34:07] <Cork> so you mean you want to replace the number?
[23:34:33] <toothe> yes
[23:34:37] <toothe> based on a variable.
[23:34:42] <Cork> heh then you're over complicating it quite a bit
[23:34:44] <negi> so first i want drag the item and drop in droppable palace then make it flow
[23:34:51] <toothe> Cork: why so?
[23:35:05] <Robdgreat> negi: so when you drag it you want it to be removed from where you took it from?
[23:35:15] <Robdgreat> negi: what you want is Sortable
[23:35:32] <Cork> toothe: "idform0".replace(/(idform)[0-9]+/, '$11')
[23:35:38] <negi> no i make a clone
[23:35:49] <negi> come in chat i will told you
[23:36:00] <toothe> basically, I have like 30 forms hat are like id_form-0-descriptoin or id_form-0-name. I am duplicating the forms, but want to increment the number.
[23:36:19] * Cork points at the line he just posted
[23:37:04] <negi> hey robDgreat can i send you a pics
[23:37:15] <Cork> toothe: so to update to what you just wrote "id_form-0".replace(/(id_form-)[0-9]+/, '$11')
[23:37:28] <Robdgreat> negi: you can post it somewhere
[23:37:30] <toothe> looking at your code, trying to unerstand it...
[23:37:32] <Cork> toothe: you could give a function to replace if you want to play some more with it
[23:37:46] <Cork> toothe: it grabs id_form- as a variable
[23:37:49] <Cork> this ends up in $1
[23:38:01] <Cork> and then it replaces what follows ([0-9]+) with 1
[23:38:39] <Cork> toothe: "id_form-0".replace(/(id_form-)[0-9]+/, function(all, name) { return name + 1; });
[23:38:46] <Cork> toothe: same thing but with a function instead ^
[23:39:03] <Robdgreat> wow
[23:39:06] <toothe> ahh...
[23:39:11] <Robdgreat> I've had this exactly same problem
[23:39:12] <Robdgreat> thanks
[23:39:12] <toothe> oh, i see how this works
[23:39:15] <Robdgreat> *exact
[23:39:18] <toothe> and you're right, I was overcomplicating this.
[23:42:37] <theshit123> How can i take the last span inside each div? http://pastebin.com/iNkV1Rjy
[23:42:39] <phoenixz> I'm using jquery validate but I have a problem: I have a form that needs to reload after a <select> has been udpated (the form will cause a submit), but it won't submit because the validation fails since other fields are still empty.. Is there a way I can set a "pre validation" callback where I check who caused the submit? (submit caused by select? don't validate)
[23:43:10] <Cork> theshit123: $('div span:last-child')
[23:43:38] <Cork> but note that only works if the span is the last child
[23:43:43] <Cork> not "last span child"
[23:43:57] <Cork> so "last child if it is a span"
[23:50:36] <doug64k> phoenixz: you need to setup an event handler that handles the submit event on the form
[23:50:40] <Tinker> Robdgreat: I cannot change it to current version. I just wanted to know is version 1.7.2 is vulnerable or something wrong with Fortify
[23:50:53] <Robdgreat> I don't know anything about Fortify
[23:51:00] <phoenixz> doug64k: doesnt the validator already do that?
[23:51:06] <doug64k> phoenixz: the validate plugin documentation probably says what to do
[23:51:38] <Cork> Tinker: i would ask the fortity developers that
[23:51:47] <doug64k> phoenixz: do you initialize the plugin? what options do you pass. do you have a fiddle to look at?
[23:51:58] <Cork> Tinker: i am kinda doubtful that it really is jquery
[23:52:28] <Cork> as jquery doesn't provide much tools that would be vulnerable (it is basically just wrappers around the browsers native dom)
[23:52:38] <phoenixz> doug64k: I don't have a fiddle for it, I just need to know how I can optionally skip validation and submit normally
[23:53:12] <toothe> Cork: thanks, I modified your code to make it work for me and picked up some knowledge on regex on the way
[23:53:15] <Cork> Tinker: to explain, i don't say that something written in jquery can't be (they very much can)
[23:53:15] <toothe> thanks amn.
[23:53:16] <toothe> thanks man*
[23:53:30] <doug64k> phoenixz: without the plugin, one might do $(document).on('submit', 'form', function(event) { ... if it is invalid indicate it in the ui and event.preventDefault(); .. })
[23:53:32] <Cork> it is just that jquery never attempts to provide the security
[23:53:38] <Cork> it is up to you to secure the content
[23:53:59] <phoenixz> doug64k: and then call the validator manually?
[23:54:20] <doug64k> phoenixz: no. if you use that plugin, then you would use that plugin. let me look at the doc for a moment
[23:55:12] <phoenixz> doug64k: From what I"ve found in the documentation, it has event callbacks for after the validation, but AFAIK, not before.. If I had that, then it would not be a problem
[23:56:03] <doug64k> phoenixz: it seems to only try to provide validation from a quick skim of the doc
[23:56:12] <Tinker> Thanks Cork & Robdgreat
[23:56:56] <doug64k> phoenixz: this implies that it automatically hooks submit http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/#too-much-recursion
[23:57:14] <doug64k> which means you must not be initializing it correctly. are you in a document ready callback?
[23:58:10] <phoenixz> yes.. But again, its all working fine, BUT, I need it to skip validation if I submit the page from <select> one to update <select> two
[23:58:42] <doug64k> phoenixz: if you run the code that does $(selector).validator(...) runs too early, then the selector matches 0 elements and 0 validators are initialized
