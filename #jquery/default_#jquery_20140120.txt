[00:46:47] <fabioportieri> o/
[00:51:18] <seutje> hmz... I have a field halfway the page that grabs focus onload, scrolling the page down to that point, not even sure if it's done by jQuery... anyone know how to debug this?
[00:52:50] <Cork> seutje: do you get a hash tag in the url bar?
[00:53:21] <Cork> seutje: btw by field, do you mean form field?
[00:53:36] <Cork> those will scroll info view on focus by default
[00:56:57] <seutje> Cork: nope, and it's actually a textarea
[00:57:17] <Cork> seutje: well still focused elements scroll into view
[00:57:22] <Cork> (form elements)
[00:57:32] <seutje> yeah, just trying to figure out what's calling focus on this
[00:58:11] <Cork> seutje: might be from "the first form element on the page"
[00:58:20] <seutje> guess all I can do rly is monkey-patch Element.prototype.focus and see what's calling it?
[00:58:28] <seutje> nah, it's like proper halfway the form
[00:58:48] <seutje> first textarea though
[00:58:53] <Cork> hmm
[00:59:01] <Cork> then ya something in js most focus it
[01:03:03] <seutje> apparently not... (function(){ var foo = Element.prototype.focus; Element.prototype.focus = function() {debugger; foo.call(this, arguments);} })(); isn't giving me anything
[01:03:19] <Cork> click?
[01:04:50] <seutje> u mean like $.fn.click?
[01:05:01] <seutje> does that throw focus? :o
[01:05:52] <Cork> ?mdn click
[01:05:54] <b-ot> Cork: HTMLElement.click - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement.click
[01:06:01] <Cork> ^ that
[01:08:42] <seutje> oh
[01:08:55] <seutje> I was looking on the Element prototype :P
[01:09:57] <seutje> aha, we have a click!
[01:19:10] <seutje> Cork: oh man, turns out it was old code incompatible with 1.10 cause it use .toggle with 2 handlers
[01:19:28] <Cork> heh, nice...
[01:19:44] <Cork> but wasn't that removed in 1.7?
[01:19:50] <Cork> ?api toggle
[01:19:50] <b-ot> Cork: .toggle(): Display or hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[01:20:38] <Cork> ah, no it was 1.8
[01:24:21] <seutje> Cork: yeah, it's a drupal, so the backoffice runs on a 1.4.old, which I had swapped out for the user-facing bits
[01:24:35] <seutje> unfortunately, there's some bits of the backoffice that leak through
[01:24:41] * Cork nods
[01:24:44] <Cork> been there
[01:25:23] <seutje> do it all the time, but normally, this bit doesn't end up user-facing
[01:50:11] <seutje> holy poop, it was calling trigger on the label instead of a link within the label
[01:50:19] <seutje> calling click*
[01:57:23] <Tomashe> Hey guys, wondering if someone have experiance with maps . i need some urgent help.
[02:00:00] <seutje> Tomashe: drawing geoJSON or manipulating google maps or something?
[02:02:33] <Tomashe> yed
[02:02:35] <Tomashe> yes
[02:02:44] <Tomashe> but more into leaflet
[02:02:49] <Tomashe> not google maps
[02:05:49] <kikoandr0id> i have a very big dillema: jquery for all my websites or javascript?
[02:08:39] <kikoandr0id> anyone?
[02:09:24] <seutje> orange juice for breakfast or fruit juice?
[02:10:35] <kikoandr0id> oh comeon
[02:11:14] <kikoandr0id> i had an argument with a friend regarding compatibility
[02:12:02] <Cork> kikoandr0id: depends on what browsers you need to support
[02:12:17] <kikoandr0id> as much as possible
[02:12:19] <Cork> if you only need to support very modern browsers
[02:12:24] <Cork> native js is quite doable
[02:12:39] <kikoandr0id> i need all of them, well, as more as possible
[02:12:41] <Cork> if you need ie7 or even ie6 then native is a pain
[02:12:49] <mehrdad> hello ppl
[02:12:51] <kikoandr0id> so jquery then
[02:13:03] <mehrdad> can you please tell me what's wrong with this ? http://jsfiddle.net/v6pb4/
[02:13:15] <Cork> kikoandr0id: you really can't answer it that generically
[02:13:33] <mehrdad> had it written using pure js and it failed, so tried with jquery and it sill fails
[02:13:34] <Cork> kikoandr0id: there is a loading cost of jquery, and there is performance difference if you know what your doing
[02:14:09] <Cork> kikoandr0id: but if you use jquery correctly it will help you avoid the pitfalls of native js
[02:14:17] <mehrdad> weird thing is that the breakpoint never gets hit
[02:14:18] <Cork> where you can lost a lot of performance
[02:14:19] <mehrdad> by fail, i mean it works for two clicks and then it goes dead
[02:14:33] <mehrdad> though it works for the first two clicks!
[02:14:58] <kikoandr0id> aham...
[02:15:09] <Cork> mehrdad: you bind click handlers over and over again
[02:15:22] <Cork> mehrdad: you should pro use a delegated click handler instead
[02:15:24] <mehrdad> true, what's wrong with that?
[02:15:33] <Cork> as you rist adding them over and over again to the same element
[02:16:02] <Cork> mehrdad: you get +1 event handler each time the element is shown and hidden
[02:16:06] <mehrdad> why it fails? i don't understand
[02:16:12] <mehrdad> hmm
[02:16:29] <mehrdad> but using js, i had it reset everytime
[02:16:36] <mehrdad> and it failed too
[02:16:43] <mehrdad> element.onclick=function(){}
[02:16:43] <Cork> uh
[02:16:52] <Cork> ugg...
[02:16:57] <mehrdad> ^^ that doesn't add a new handler every time
[02:17:09] <Cork> no it doens't add handlers at all
[02:17:14] <Cork> it adds even attributes
[02:17:20] <Cork> and those are legacy and broken in many ways
[02:17:37] <Cork> anyway the html is needed to tell what happens
[02:17:53] <Cork> but you should learn to write modern web code
[02:17:58] <mehrdad> well the breakpoint doesn't get hit either
[02:18:09] <Cork> (as in code standard > 1997)
[02:18:40] <mehrdad> so.... i thought you were sure what's wrong with the jquery code?
[02:19:00] <Cork> like i said, as more then half the code is missing i can't say
[02:19:08] <Cork> i can only do wild guesses
[02:19:22] <Cork> but from what you said, i suspect there is a lot wrong with the code
[02:19:22] <mehrdad> more than half the code? the html u mean?
[02:19:36] <Cork> your html is your code as you use event attributes
[02:19:45] <mehrdad> okay here you go then....
[02:20:23] <mehrdad> http://jsfiddle.net/v6pb4/1/
[02:20:34] <mehrdad> ignore the c# mix
[02:21:15] <mehrdad> look at the first button
[02:21:24] <mehrdad> that's the only important element
[02:22:59] <Cork> sigh...
[02:23:50] <mehrdad> Cork: what's wrong?
[02:24:13] <Cork> mehrdad: take the fiddle and make a working examle
[02:24:20] <Cork> *example
[02:24:25] <Cork> just code dumping won't help
[02:24:35] <mehrdad>  alright
[02:26:35] <mehrdad> hmm it says showAll undefined http://jsfiddle.net/v6pb4/5/
[02:26:54] <Cork> ya, you define the functions in onload
[02:27:06] <Cork> if you want it accessable from html you need to have it in global scope
[02:27:21] <Cork> also no body tag in the html section
[02:27:55] <Tomashe> i have a 1000 users in my app, and i added map, now i want to show them in my map in case they are in the visible range , anyone can help me how to do it. i have no experiance with maps whats so ever
[02:32:43] <mehrdad> what the hell is global scope?
[02:33:01] <mehrdad> that's how it works locally
[02:33:12] <mehrdad> is it a jsfiddle quirk?
[02:33:48] <abishek> how do I show a smooth transition when a buttons width changes. For example http://jsfiddle.net/EqwkQ/114/
[02:34:10] <Cork> mehrdad: global scope is how it works when you don't scope the code at all
[02:34:23] <Cork> mehrdad: if you check on the right the code is run in "onload"
[02:34:37] <Cork> move it to "head" and it won't have any function wrapper and be in global scope
[02:34:58] <mehrdad> well sure
[02:35:03] <mehrdad> i know that
[02:35:21] <Cork> mehrdad: and to answer your question
[02:35:23] <mehrdad> thought jsfiddle links the js section and loads it itself
[02:35:30] <Cork> global scope is when things is attached to window.<name>
[02:35:45] <mehrdad> wait
[02:35:49] <mehrdad> i'm updating it
[02:36:06] <mehrdad> ok thx for explaining
[02:37:17] <mehrdad> Cork:  phew http://jsfiddle.net/v6pb4/19/
[02:40:24] <Cork> sigh...
[02:40:49] <mehrdad> updated again http://jsfiddle.net/v6pb4/20/
[02:41:09] <mehrdad> is that the solution? to sigh?
[02:41:24] <mehrdad> i tried it the first time you said it
[02:41:48] <Cork> mehrdad: well you still lack the working example
[02:41:59] <mehrdad> http://jsfiddle.net/v6pb4/20/
[02:42:00] <Cork> meaning remove the server code and add working html there
[02:42:07] <mehrdad> lol
[02:42:16] <mehrdad> lolwut
[02:42:29] <mehrdad> server code? that's plain text
[02:42:35] <mehrdad> click the button
[02:43:20] <mehrdad> you can only click it two times, the third time it starts to fail
[02:44:46] <abishek> how do I show a smooth transition when a buttons width changes. For example http://jsfiddle.net/EqwkQ/114/
[02:44:55] <Cork> mehrdad: yes cause each time you tiggle you add a new event handler to the even
[02:44:58] <Cork> *element
[02:45:15] <Cork> mehrdad: jquery.click != elm.onclick
[02:47:38] <mehrdad> Cork:  so? how clear it?
[02:48:13] <Cork> mehrdad: http://jsfiddle.net/v6pb4/23/
[02:48:29] <Cork> as you don't care about making good code
[02:48:49] <mehrdad> return true
[02:48:49] <Cork> or just set a string to onclick
[02:49:04] * seutje gasps
[02:50:11] <loxnet> hello, bonjour
[02:51:14] <mehrdad> damn
[02:51:44] <mehrdad> i swear that's pretty much what i had the first time
[02:51:47] <mehrdad> using just js
[02:51:55] <mehrdad> anyway
[02:51:59] <mehrdad> thx
[02:53:13] <loxnet> please help : I've a function to create complex object $.fn.mycomplexObject and i'd like to call a function from this object after implementation. example : $("#foo").myObject({args;params}); $("#foo).myObject().myFunction(); It returns that it's not a function
[02:54:01] <loxnet> please help me
[02:55:22] <furyFoo> Does anyone know why jQuery generated CSS isn't applied until refresh . This seems to be quite random and only happening from CSS applied from inside a FOR loop.
[02:55:50] <furyFoo> Bad code or possible browser bug/feature ?
[03:02:56] <Amnesia> question, when a submit button isn't posting a form, how could I debug the cause of it?
[03:03:05] <furyFoo> loxnet have you considered using TypeScript ?
[03:03:27] <Amnesia> (the reason I'm asking it here, is because the button has been dynamically added using jqyery, and the buttons that already were there, e.g. weren't added by jquery, are working fine)
[03:03:49] <furyFoo> Does the button fire the submit function ?
[03:04:06] <Amnesia> well, basically I'm able to trigger an alert() when the button gets clicked
[03:04:19] <Amnesia> but basically the page itself should be submitted, and my backend should handle the request
[03:04:21] <loxnet> furyFoo: no TypeScript
[03:04:27] <Amnesia> so basically there's no javascript involved
[03:04:56] <furyFoo> I would just call the PHP via  AJAX
[03:05:38] <furyFoo> You're already dynamically adding the button , what's a 7 more lines of code ?
[03:06:12] <furyFoo> Or you can trigger the submit via another method and see if that works
[03:06:35] <Amnesia> http://jsfiddle.net/9cu8H/10/
[03:06:52] <Amnesia> haven't thought of that..
[03:07:44] <Amnesia> what're you referring to with "another method"?
[03:09:18] <furyFoo> A onclick event on a static HTML element that calls in the submit function?
[03:09:39] <furyFoo> You're not using a form so I'm guessing anything goes
[03:10:13] <Amnesia> the table in my actual app is resided in a form
[03:10:34] <Amnesia> "the submit function" -> a javascript function right?
[03:12:03] <furyFoo> Whatever you're doing to call in the PHP
[03:12:29] <Amnesia> well, usually "submitting" is done by the browser right?
[03:12:32] <Rafzzz> can I use a variable declared earlier in a function as $.ajax data: without getting undefined?
[03:13:48] <Rafzzz> var x = document....("xdir").value = > data: x,
[03:13:53] <Rafzzz> dosn't like that apparently
[03:13:57] <furyFoo> Amnesia how long have you been using jQuery ?
[03:14:10] <Amnesia> furyFoo: not that long
[03:14:18] <Amnesia> I'm a real js noob in general
[03:15:05] <furyFoo> Then I think you're missing the back-end or the method to POST the var content to the back-end
[03:15:56] <Amnesia> furyFoo: you are aware of the fact that  the 2 rows, that were already there, so were not added using js, are actually submitted when I press the save button?
[03:16:28] <furyFoo> Rafz did you declared the var at the top of the file ?
[03:17:05] <Rafzzz> furyFoo: yah, inside the function: var x = ...
[03:18:49] <Rafzzz> furyFoo: can I use variables like that in $.ajax
[03:36:36] <Tomashe> i need someone with experiance with leaflet
[03:38:01] <Justice> Hm i got a question about iterating through xml I got this = http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/6785365/
[03:38:28] <Justice> i want to iterate through the type to get its id and then get the "sell" median
[03:39:24] <Justice> I got this far = http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/6785385/
[03:39:48] <Justice> but it seems that the price "volume" values are not correct
[03:40:21] <Justice> Am I doing something flawed here or?
[03:44:44] <Cork> Justice: looks correct, what do you get?
[03:48:04] <Amnesia> Cork: remember my "not wanting to submit the form" issue? I'm wondering whether I perhaps should manually define the submit action, is that actually the case?
[03:48:35] <Cork> Amnesia: was it the page with multiple forms?
[03:48:37] <Cork> else no
[03:48:50] <Amnesia> yes, it has got multiple forms
[03:49:02] <Amnesia> I thought the browser itself should handle the submit action
[03:49:12] <Amnesia> but perhaps that's not the case since the row has been added by js
[03:49:20] <Cork> Amnesia: depends if you want ajax or normal submissions
[03:49:27] <Amnesia> I'd prefer normal submissions
[03:49:31] <Cork> normal submissions should just work
[03:49:43] <Amnesia> that's what I thought:)...
[03:50:05] <Justice> Cork: the values seem totaly out of place
[03:50:33] <Cork> Justice: do you find the type element?
[03:50:50] <Justice> Cork: I get the ID's correct just the price seems od
[03:51:00] <Amnesia> Cork: $('#Werkopdrachten').delegate('button.opslaan', 'click', function() { alert('test'); }); does actually do the job
[03:51:37] <Amnesia> so js, is able to respond to the button itself
[03:52:26] <Justice> Cork: just like the price i get does not seem to exist in the xml file, eather it adds some other numbers and gets them out or maybe a threading issue with ajax?
[03:56:31] <Justice> got to run for a class but be back later
[03:56:55] <Cork> Justice: i'll see if i can get something out of it
[03:57:00] <Cork> your code looks correct though
[03:59:13] <Cork> Justice: http://jsfiddle.net/jDC25/
[03:59:18] <Cork> looks fine here
[04:54:59] <olivvv> hi. Is there a site listing extension to jquery-ui
[04:55:02] <olivvv> ?
[04:55:21] <olivvv> sorry to jquery-ui datepicker
[04:55:58] <Cork> not any official ones no
[05:04:20] <olivvv> Cork: and unoffical ? I doesn't need to be endorsed by anyone
[05:04:35] <Cork> olivvv: google?
[05:04:55] <Cork> ?g jquery datepicker plugins
[05:04:56] <b-ot> Cork: Datepicker | jQuery UI → http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[05:06:00] <olivvv>  I started using internet yesterday not that use to gogglle
[05:06:26] <olivvv> ok but srsly http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/ is not listing extension
[05:06:52] <olivvv> but I know there is a bunch of them, some even with quality code
[05:07:47] <olivvv> such as thisone http://multidatespickr.sourceforge.net/
[05:08:28] <Cork> you have just as much chance of finding them as i have
[05:09:32] <olivvv> sure
[05:10:05] <olivvv> my hope was not to get you working for me, but to find somebody that has already done that
[05:10:32] <olivvv> since it appears that we are not alone on this channel
[05:21:09] <andr0id1> anyone ahs a good source for jquery like a book or video tut?
[05:21:56] <fabioportieri> http://learn.jquery.com/
[05:33:50] <Amnesia> question, is there some way to select all the input fields on the current tr?
[05:35:56] <fabioportieri> Amnesia: $("tr").filter(":input")
[05:35:57] <Amnesia> I want to do an ajax call, with all the data specified on the current row
[05:36:19] <Amnesia> fabioportieri: would it be possible to use the output object of that line as the "data" argument of $.ajax?
[05:37:31] <fabioportieri> you have to serialize them first
[05:37:44] <Amnesia> https://privatepaste.com/13186c7e0c
[05:47:02] <morfin> hello
[05:47:26] <morfin> anybody can suggest me how can i keep several elements in plugin(initialized for collection)?
[05:47:54] <Cork> what do you mean by keep?
[05:48:02] <morfin> i have a link i click then select in div is being created, that div becomes dialog
[05:48:34] <morfin> but dialog moves element away from my link
[05:48:40] <Amnesia> fabioportieri: would that be anywhere close?
[05:49:00] <Cork> morfin: so .data('my-plugin', ref) ?
[05:49:03] <Tumulte> hey !
[05:49:09] <morfin> ref? hmm
[05:49:20] <Amnesia> https://privatepaste.com/ab1ebfed5c
[05:49:23] <Cork> morfin: reference to the data you want to reference
[05:49:29] <Cork> ?api .data
[05:49:29] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[05:49:30] <Tumulte> can I don this : children(".class1, .class2") ?
[05:49:31] <Cork> ?api data
[05:49:34] <b-ot> Cork: .data(): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[05:49:39] <Cork> Tumulte: yes
[05:50:55] <fabioportieri> Amnesia: data: form.serialize();   where form = $("#yourformID")
[05:51:06] <morfin> i was trying this: $(this).data("select",select) where $(this) is a and select is jquery object
[05:51:19] <Cork> morfin: should work
[05:51:23] <Amnesia> fabioportieri: ty
[05:51:25] <morfin> it does not :(
[05:51:35] <Cork> morfin: what doesn't work?
[05:51:56] <Amnesia> fabioportieri: but what if I'd only want to have the stuff that's on the current tr ?
[05:51:57] <Cork> morfin: $(elm).data('select') would give you those references later)
[05:52:01] <Amnesia> (e.g. all input fields)
[05:52:24] <fabioportieri> Amnesia: then you select only the input you need and serialize them
[05:52:56] <Amnesia> fabioportieri: isn't that what I've actually done in: https://privatepaste.com/ab1ebfed5c ?
[05:55:46] <fabioportieri> Amnesia: it appears so
[05:55:52] <Amnesia> hm, ty:p
[05:56:10] <fabioportieri> no prob
[05:57:53] <Tumulte> Cork: thanks
[06:26:41] <TheJHNZ> $('.new-post-field', '.new-reply-field')
[06:26:48] <TheJHNZ> this is how to select 2 elements right ?
[06:27:10] <fabioportieri> no
[06:27:23] <fabioportieri> remove ', '
[06:27:45] <fabioportieri> that is a shortcut for find(), if i'm not mistaken
[06:28:00] <TheJHNZ> wait got it
[06:28:02] <fabioportieri> $("elem1, elem2, elem3")
[06:28:06] <BillCriswell> I think they're shooting for $('.new-post-field, .new-reply-field')
[06:28:06] <TheJHNZ> yeah
[06:28:07] <TheJHNZ> :)
[06:29:28] <BillCriswell> Just found an awesome drawling of earth worm jim I did randomly a couple weeks ago. Cheered me up!
[06:35:01] <dwarder> is this ok: $.when(function().pipe('otherFunction')).then(function() ....
[06:35:10] <dwarder> this pipe thing in $.when
[06:37:03] <dwarder> is it oke to put .pipe in $.when ?
[06:37:05] <dwarder> ok*
[06:37:27] <aeroraver> what's the best way to temporary copy elements to a new position?
[06:37:41] <BillCriswell> dwarder: pipe is deprecated.
[06:38:15] <dwarder> BillCriswell: besides that is deprecated, will it work the way i described?
[06:41:20] <dwarder> BillCriswell: what to use instead?
[06:41:23] <dwarder> :(
[06:43:35] <BillCriswell> I never really used pipe so I was looking it up. What you're doing seems like it should be ok. Are you trying to transform the data before doing something to it?
[06:44:29] <BillCriswell> Looking at SO it's basically like a way to alter the result of some ajax requests?
[06:46:00] <durre> if an ajax request fails, can I recreate it with the data provided? what I want to achieve is check for a 401, refresh tokens, then retry the original request with the new tokens.
[06:46:10] <fabioportieri> aeroraver: maybe you want .clone() ?
[06:47:14] <aeroraver> yeah I was looking at that, i might have done something wrong in my code, because the lists that normally expand stayed collapsed
[06:47:38] <ahandy> How do you use Tween to fade in an element without the use of opacity?
[06:47:43] <ahandy> Like the same as fadeIn()
[06:48:15] <fabioportieri> aeroraver: are you using delegate() ?
[06:48:39] <Trudko> guys it is possible to have selector with whatever character in middle for example  [id^='elementer_number_*']
[06:49:18] <aeroraver> fabioportieri: no, is that recommended?
[06:50:07] <fabioportieri> aeroraver: yes if you are creating dom elements on the fly
[06:50:27] <fabioportieri> otherwise newly create elements won't have event listeners to them
[06:50:47] <fabioportieri> that may be the cause for which the list won't work
[06:51:16] <aeroraver> fabioportieri: alright i'll look into that then
[06:56:08] <BillCriswell> Trudko: That selector would work.
[06:56:09] <pbodymind> hei... how can i select something inside a $(this) ... example: http://jsfiddle.net/Pb2M5/
[06:56:44] <Amnesia> input = $(this).closest('tr').filter(':input').serialize();
[06:57:01] <Amnesia> would that be correct to select all the inputfields of the current <tr> ?
[06:57:15] <BillCriswell> pbodymind: $(this).find('.foo')
[06:57:35] <BillCriswell> Well, for your code .find('span')
[06:57:45] <pbodymind> tks u
[06:58:02] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: No. Thnk you want .find() as well.
[06:58:26] <BillCriswell> filter() would only look through the <tr> you have selected.
[06:58:33] <BillCriswell> pbodymind: No problem.
[07:00:28] <Amnesia> BillCriswell: input = $(this).closest('tr').find(':input').serialize(); ?
[07:00:40] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: Yurp.
[07:00:57] <TheJHNZ> http://baboom.com/kimdotcom
[07:00:59] <TheJHNZ> opps
[07:01:14] <BillCriswell> You might be able to get away with just .closest('tr').serialize(); though. Haven't tried it.
[07:01:17] <Amnesia> BillCriswell: muchas gracias!
[07:03:32] <BillCriswell> Nope. need the input call.
[07:03:41] <BillCriswell> Guess it only works on a form element.
[07:03:54] <BillCriswell> Like that
[07:04:30] <Amnesia> yup
[07:07:27] <fabioportieri> http://hackertyper.net/  :>
[07:08:36] * aquatix bashes his keyboard with his forehead
[07:11:42] <Crucials> now I can pretend I know wtf im doing while typing really fast!
[07:13:24] <BillCriswell> You can hit option 3 times for "access granted" or caps lock 20 times for access denied...
[07:13:27] <BillCriswell> Seems like a lot of typing.
[07:13:40] <BillCriswell> Oh 6 times.
[07:13:45] <BillCriswell> What the hell was I doing.
[07:14:06] <Amnesia> BillCriswell: serializeArray() should return an array right?
[07:14:19] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: Believe it or not yes.
[07:14:24] <Crucials> 3 times I thought. and then escape clears it
[07:14:33] <BillCriswell> Crucials: You're probably right.
[07:14:48] <Amnesia> BillCriswell: https://privatepaste.com/a7629941f9
[07:14:55] <Crucials> first thing i do is delve into the code :P
[07:15:01] <Amnesia> that only returns: [object Object]
[07:15:14] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: That's right.
[07:15:16] <sx> serializeArray just works on form?
[07:15:30] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: You'd want fields.name or fields.value
[07:15:46] <Amnesia> hm, so it's a nested array?
[07:15:47] <ahandy> How do you use Tween to fade in an element without the use of opacity, similar to jquerys fadeIn()
[07:15:57] <BillCriswell> You get the array like: [ { name: "first", value: "Bill" }, { name: "last", value: "Criswell" }]
[07:16:09] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: Nope. It's just one dimension.
[07:16:19] <BillCriswell> I think. I'm bad with words.
[07:16:22] <Amnesia> nah
[07:17:07] <BillCriswell> Also, if you did console.log( fields ); you'd get something way more useful back.
[07:17:24] <BillCriswell> Also, with serializeArray() output you could use console.table(fields) for a nice tabular view of the data.
[07:17:45] <Amnesia> I somehow need a way to get arr[0], arr[2] etc..
[07:18:04] <fabioportieri> try console.dir(array)
[07:18:09] <Amnesia> ty
[07:18:27] <Amnesia> I'll give that a try
[07:18:39] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: You can do that with input, so input[0] would be { name: "name", value: "value" }
[07:18:49] <BillCriswell> Do you just want an array of the values?
[07:18:49] <Amnesia> ah ok
[07:18:54] <Amnesia> yep
[07:18:59] <Amnesia> input.flatten!:P?
[07:19:13] <Amnesia> cause this is an hash inside of an array:p
[07:19:31] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: I'd use map. input.map(function(o){ return o.value });
[07:20:15] <BillCriswell> If you need IE8 support jQuery has $.map, so var values = $.map(input, function(o){ return o.value; });
[07:20:43] <Amnesia> hm guess I'll just go for input[0][0]
[07:21:09] <Amnesia> it's not pretty, but it does the job..:P)
[07:21:54] <morfin> hmmmm
[07:21:59] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[07:22:10] <morfin> $.proxy does change context but something stange happens
[07:22:16] <[1]centran> so when jquery tabs had the select even you could do something like this.... var id = $(ui.tab).attr("rel"); to get the value of an element
[07:22:21] <BillCriswell> Just keep in mind an object order isn't set in stone.
[07:22:33] <[1]centran> I discovered that select is now deprecated and you have to use activate
[07:22:40] <Amnesia> BillCriswell: hm
[07:23:02] <[1]centran> you can call ui.newTab but it returns a jquery object and not the name of the tab
[07:23:16] <[1]centran> question is how to make var id = $(ui.tab).attr("rel") + '-out'; good in jquery 1.10
[07:23:28] <BillCriswell> input[0][0] may work, but you're not guaranteed it'll be the "name" or "value" property.
[07:23:28] <Amnesia> BillCriswell: how does the array object differ compared to the array used in  http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_obj_array.asp ?
[07:24:26] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: Actually, your way won't work.
[07:24:33] <BillCriswell> Just tried it thinking it would but it won't.
[07:24:38] <Amnesia> nope, it doesn't
[07:24:39] <BillCriswell> You'd want input[0].value
[07:24:52] <BillCriswell> But the .map I just provided you with would return all values in an array.
[07:24:53] <Amnesia> I'm too used to other languages
[07:25:01] <Amnesia> hm ty
[07:25:09] <BillCriswell> all "value" properties in an array*
[07:25:09] <Amnesia> sorry for my ignorance ^.^
[07:25:18] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[07:26:46] <BillCriswell> [1]centran: That's fine.
[07:27:29] <Amnesia> BillCriswell: it's working, thx for your patience
[07:27:43] <BillCriswell> No problem at all
[07:28:38] <[1]centran> if you where to use ui.NewTab in the activate event how would you get the value of an element? ... so ui.NewTab is a jquery object, how do you get the value of an element of a jquery object?
[07:29:28] <BillCriswell> cenron: Is ui.NewTab an input? What kind of value are you talking about?
[07:30:27] <[1]centran> with tabs you can hook into an event... http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#event-activate
[07:31:54] <[1]centran> so ui.newTab is a jquery object
[07:33:12] <BillCriswell> Ok, so you're saying ui.newTab is an html element that has a rel attribute?
[07:33:31] <[1]centran> trying to get the value of the rel attribute
[07:34:45] <BillCriswell> Right, but does the root element or $(ui.newTab) have a rel attribute?
[07:34:55] <[1]centran> yes
[07:35:29] <BillCriswell> But it's returning undefined when you do .attr('rel') ?
[07:36:53] <BillCriswell> Ok, I want you to do console.log( ui.newTab ) and make sure it's the HTML you think it is.
[07:37:02] <[1]centran> $(ui.tab).attr("rel") is undefined so discoverd that should be using ui.newTab... tried do ui.newTab.attr('rel') which is undefined
[07:38:18] <BillCriswell> do console.log( ui.newTab ) and make sure it's what you think it is.
[07:38:37] <BillCriswell> I have no issue getting the rel attribute here: http://jsbin.com/ACUyUdE/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:41:34] <[1]centran> 09:41:15.053 [object Object] crontab.js:113
[07:41:34] <[1]centran> 09:41:17.676 TypeError: $(...).attr(...) is undefined
[07:42:57] <[1]centran> opps , ignore the typeerror. from another line
[07:43:18] <BillCriswell> cenron: Ok, do console.log( ui.newTab[0] )
[07:43:32] <BillCriswell> [1]centran: ^ my bad cenron.
[07:45:28] <[1]centran> [object HTMLLIElement]
[07:46:38] <BillCriswell> Does the <li> have the rel attribute you're looking for?
[07:47:50] <shoky> also use a better browser
[07:48:01] <[1]centran> ahh.. no it is the anchor tag within the li that has the rel tag
[07:48:26] <BillCriswell> cenron: There goes the issue. So .find('a').attr('rel') should do the trick.
[07:49:07] <enzo> hello
[07:50:06] <[1]centran> awesome! find works
[07:50:08] <[1]centran> thank you
[07:50:31] <BillCriswell> No problem
[07:51:11] <decx> do css conventions apply to jquery as well? for example: find('#id') or find('.class') is moer effective than find('tag')?
[07:51:23] <decx> i guess id would be. but what about class
[07:53:34] <BillCriswell> decx: Not sure what you mean. Are you talking speed wise?
[07:54:15] <decx> yeah
[07:56:43] <decx> for example is it better to $('#myelement a') or $('#myelement .mylink') when #myelement is guaranteed to contain only one anchor
[07:57:05] <BillCriswell> I'm sure the difference would be so minor it wouldn't matter.
[07:59:08] <decx> so what if myelement contains a thousand anchors? :D
[08:00:34] <Amnesia> BillCriswell: what'd be the correct syntax for location.reload() in the following: https://privatepaste.com/e451c8cf2d ?
[08:00:43] <Amnesia> firefox's compaining about a syntax error
[08:00:44] <BillCriswell> decx: http://jsbin.com/efuBEVIn/2/edit?html,js,output looks like class would be quicker.
[08:00:56] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: It would need to be in a function.
[08:01:03] <Amnesia> ah gay
[08:01:06] <Amnesia> that's ugly:p
[08:01:18] <BillCriswell> Or maybe just location.reload
[08:01:22] <BillCriswell> Without the ().
[08:01:29] <Amnesia> nope, already tried it
[08:01:35] <BillCriswell> Ah, well there you go then.
[08:01:36] <Amnesia> missing }
[08:01:40] <decx> sweet test, how reliable is time and timeend
[08:01:43] <decx> ?
[08:02:22] <BillCriswell> I dunno.
[08:03:12] <BillCriswell> decx: http://jsperf.com/ might be able to get somehting more reliable here? I don't know though. I'm sure using it through jsbin isn't helping things much.
[08:04:03] <decx> oh right, i even have that bookmarked
[08:05:05] <BillCriswell> http://jsperf.com/tag-vs-class2
[08:05:52] <BillCriswell> Probably really shouldn't be worried about this kind of stuff until you have to.
[08:06:35] <decx> yeah that's negligible
[08:08:15] <decx> when i add a few dozen more meows, tag is a bit faster
[08:08:21] <decx> unexpected
[08:10:28] <decx> well it's different across browsers
[08:10:41] <decx> in chrome class is faster
[08:11:27] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, damn rabbit holes.
[08:13:16] <BillCriswell> Then it might not be the case in older versions of Chrome. I just try to keep the code readable. It's been working out so far!
[08:16:44] <decx> but it's nice to have some data on it. i feel like a fancy scientist now ^^
[08:19:30] <BillCriswell> I wish I could feel like a fancy scientist. freenode has a way of keeping you humble haha.
[09:25:06] <freeed> Hey all-what is the correct syntax to use .on() with a jQuery plugin, i.e. with $('.foo').cycle({ fx: 'fade' }) for example?
[09:44:34] <BillCriswell> freeed: You should be able to use it just like any other element.
[10:16:36] <kpl> Howto get the option value shown in a <select>? I dont get any value by $('select').val();   However $('select').length is 1, $('select').prop("id") is the id, and $('select').text() is "NoYes" (the two options).
[10:17:54] <shoky> kpl: $('select').find('option:selected').text()
[10:18:37] <shoky> $('select').val() should get you the selected option's value
[10:19:43] <kpl> shoky: I see, thanks. So the selected options values are given by value="" in the <option value="">No</option>?
[10:19:56] <shoky> ya
[10:21:21] <kpl> And setting the displayed text / value is done by .val("0");  if <option value="0">No</option>?
[10:25:28] <shoky> yeah
[10:26:49] <digifiv5e> Anyone know how to stop jquery code from being executed by the browser prefetch/caching?
[10:28:42] <BillCriswell> The browser prefetching shouldn't be executing code. As for the caching I think you'd just need to set the expire time properly.
[10:31:04] <digifiv5e> it's def hitting get reqest on / and causing my code to execute
[10:31:17] <digifiv5e> it's a mix of php/jquery
[10:34:07] <BillCriswell> digifiv5e: Have it live?
[10:34:25] <digifiv5e> localhost
[10:40:23] <lethjakman> does .on('click' work the same as .live did?
[10:41:44] <BillCriswell> digifiv5e: You're sure the code is running? The browser would make the get request but I'm not positive it would execute it. That seems bad to me.
[10:42:53] <BillCriswell> lethjakman: Almost. You'd basically want to do $(document).on('click', '.whatYouWantToListenOn', fn);
[10:42:56] <duch_kazatel> executing what code huh?
[10:43:09] <lethjakman> BillCriswell: but it will automatically attach when I add new elements?
[10:43:27] <digifiv5e> BillCriswell, it's executing code (a mysql update statement) prior to pressing enter in my addressbar, then again after i press enter (which is causing major headaches)
[10:43:53] <duch_kazatel> lethjakman what BillCriswell provided uses event delegation.
[10:43:58] <BillCriswell> digifiv5e: Ohhhhhhhh!
[10:44:12] <lethjakman> duch_kazatel: what's that mean?
[10:44:23] <BillCriswell> digifiv5e: I was confused. I thought you meant like you were loading a page and the page was prefetching things.
[10:44:43] <duch_kazatel> lethjakman you bind the listener on an element that exists at pageload (or when you attach the listener) and it listens for events as they bubble up.
[10:44:56] <lethjakman> ahhhhh
[10:45:06] <lethjakman> so because he's using the class later on rather than in the selector
[10:45:08] <digifiv5e> BillCriswell, no, the page is being executed twice for every once (due to pre-fetching)
[10:45:08] <lethjakman> that's interesting.
[10:45:11] <lethjakman> didin't know about that.
[10:45:26] <duch_kazatel> lethjakman yeah - delegation / bubbling aren't levereged nearly enough imo.
[10:45:36] <lethjakman> are there any drawbacks?
[10:45:40] <lethjakman> definitely didn't know about that
[10:45:44] <BillCriswell> lethjakman: What I'm doing is waiting for a click on the body, and I look to see what triggered the event and added that.
[10:46:06] <lethjakman> ahhhh
[10:46:43] <duch_kazatel> most events (like "click") bubble up through the document to the root node.  there are 2 drabacks to me.  1: troubleshooting can be a little hard because you're never sure where the event listener is bound unless you have the code in front of you. 2: you're now testing EVERY event that happens inside of that element.
[10:47:08] <BillCriswell> digifiv5e: I hadd that problem before. I forget how I got around it.
[10:47:09] <duch_kazatel> #2 also happened with .live() iirc.  but you can avoid that by binding as far down the document as possible.
[10:48:49] <BillCriswell> digifiv5e: http://superuser.com/questions/394562/can-i-turn-off-google-chromes-new-prerendering
[10:50:15] <BillCriswell> digifiv5e: That issue really anoyed me.
[10:51:23] <digifiv5e> BillCriswell, oh yea, easily wasted a few hundred bucks on it already just figure out what the problem was. -- and not to mention the implications on services like amazon that charge per request
[10:52:01] <mdev> i need two listbox looking things one with a list of entries and a move over type icon that moves the ones I want to the other listbox type thing
[10:52:07] <mdev> is there a standard name for this type of control
[10:53:51] <BillCriswell> digifiv5e: Yeah. Luckily for me it was just adding things to a database twice haha.
[10:57:05] <mdev> looks something like this https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/50354233/info.png
[10:57:47] <cohitre> @mdev multiselect boxes
[10:58:02] <mdev> @cohitre thanks
[10:58:04] <duch_kazatel> mdev i'm not sure there's a specific name for that.  it's two multiselect boxes that let you move from one to the other.
[10:58:24] <cohitre> you can add a `multiple` attribute to your <select>
[10:58:47] <duch_kazatel> I think he's asking about the control that uses two and you can move from one to the other.
[10:59:07] <mdev> http://i.stack.imgur.com/MXNrO.png perfect thanks
[11:01:01] <BillCriswell> I always hated those things.
[11:01:17] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell same here.
[11:01:23] <duch_kazatel> it feels like a bad compromise.
[11:03:10] <mdev> why is it a bad compromise? I have a thousand users I need to allow the admin to select some or all to message
[11:03:19] <mdev> so seems like best/easiest solution for my purpose
[11:03:41] <BillCriswell> Would a list of checkboxes work here or does the order of the "Chosen Fonts" matter?
[11:04:19] <duch_kazatel> are the users consistently "grouped" together?  just seems like a lot of "here's all the data figure it out yourself".
[11:04:27] <mdev> checkboxs isn't as flexible I don't think, cause you have to check each individual one and maybe you'll have a "check all box"
[11:04:42] <mdev> but as far as selecting a group easier via the other method
[11:05:36] <mdev> as far as grouping users that's a good point
[11:05:51] <mdev> think i'm going to add a combobox that displays group types, one option being all
[11:06:02] <mdev> and have that update the user list the admins able to select from
[11:08:35] <kpl> I have a table with several <input type="checkbox" value="xxx">. Howto get the values of the checked boxes?  And for identical ones, except that type="radio"?
[11:08:59] <duch_kazatel> kpl huh?  have a fiddle?
[11:09:08] <duch_kazatel> kpl $(selector).val() will get you values.
[11:09:20] <BillCriswell> kpl: $(':checked') will get you the checked checkboxes.
[11:09:37] <kpl> Thanks
[11:10:02] <BillCriswell> With those answers combined. You're like 90% there.
[11:10:07] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[11:12:25] <kpl> I collect the values of the checked checkboxes and radios in an array, so could I do something like  'input type=checbox:checked'.each() getting val() ?
[11:12:47] <duch_kazatel> kpl you wouldn't use .each() on an array because that's slow and boring ;)
[11:14:09] <duch_kazatel> but using what you've got there - $('input[type="checbox"]:checked').each(function(){$(this).val()});
[11:14:21] <duch_kazatel> err $('input[type="checkbox"]:checked').each(function(){$(this).val()});
[11:14:42] <duch_kazatel> though you could probably omit the [type="checkbox"]
[11:14:55] <kpl> Thanks, you understood I was looking for some help getting the exact syntax there.
[11:15:21] <duch_kazatel> but avoid using .each() when possible.  it's slooooowwww
[11:16:29] <kpl> In this case I'm submitting the array to a server, so I suppose I will not notice the difference. However, how would you do it more efficiently?
[11:17:01] <duch_kazatel> kpl if you're working with an array, use a plain for (var i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++){} instead.
[11:17:37] <kpl> OK, but in theis cae I'm building the array from the checked elements..
[11:17:38] <duch_kazatel> even better, cache your array length ahead of time - (var i = 0, theLength = myArray.length; i < theLength; i++)
[11:18:10] <duch_kazatel> kpl sure, why do you need .each() to do that?
[11:18:43] <BillCriswell> kpl: How is the server expecting it?
[11:20:07] <kpl> I wanted to iterate the selected elements (i.e. the checked ones) and collected their values, so thought I could use each to iterate the set.
[11:20:32] <duch_kazatel> kpl you can use a plain array iterator.
[11:20:40] <duch_kazatel> .each() isn't necessary at all for that.
[11:21:18] <kpl> BillCriswell: as a JSON string which I deserialize to a C# List.
[11:22:36] <kpl> [  serverfunc(string vals){ List<dynamic> aVals = javaScriptSerializer.Deserialize<dynamic[]>(vals).ToList(); }  ]
[11:24:10] <kpl> However, I could modify that server func if there is a more efficient alternative.
[11:27:34] <BillCriswell> kpl: You might just need serialize.
[11:28:48] <BillCriswell> $(':checked').serialize() would return like name=value&name2=value2 an so on... but if you have names like <input name="checkboxes['name']" value="Foo"> you should be able to look through checkboxes server side... not sure how C handles post / get variables.
[11:29:12] <BillCriswell> s/look/loop
[11:29:42] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell that's even smarter. the less work on the client side, the better imo
[11:30:43] <BillCriswell> Yeah I just wasn't sure C# has like a $_GET or $_POST thingie.
[11:30:47] <kpl> BillCriswell: I've got a number of different customized elements I want to pass values for, so I thought it would be nice to have some low level control on the format. I also pass ids (pure numbers extracted from the element ids) in another array.
[11:30:51] <BillCriswell> I only know PHP.
[11:31:19] <kpl> And then I want to transfer the values back to the elements later..
[11:31:56] <BillCriswell> kpl: Whatever works best for you haha
[11:58:08] <jamest3> Hi i was wondering if anyone can give me some tips for my jquery ui autocomplete function. https://gist.github.com/jamesjtong/8527845  . Right now I am trying to rewrite focus but i am having trouble. Thanks
[12:03:23] <kpl> Howto select input with type="checkbox" AND value="someval"?   'input[type="checkbox"][value="someval"]' ?
[12:06:40] <kpl> Seems to work
[12:23:38] <jamest3> Hi i was wondering if anyone can give me some tips for my jquery ui autocomplete function. https://gist.github.com/jamesjtong/8527845  . Right now I am trying to rewrite focus but i am having trouble. Thanks
[12:49:30] <sdwrage> Hey all. Is there a good jquery plugin that will allow a div to scroll with the page until it hits, say, a footer?
[12:51:23] <duch_kazatel> sdwrage why not use position: fixed; ?
[12:51:40] <sdwrage> duch_kazatel, because it goes passed my footer
[12:51:45] <sdwrage> past*
[12:52:35] <BillCriswell> sdwrage: jQuery Waypoints may be what you're looking for.
[12:52:40] <duch_kazatel> there's also: http://stickyjs.com/
[12:53:58] <ovnicraft> hi i am working with $ajax() and has this call https://gist.github.com/ovnicraft/8528851 i read the doc to use minLength and says: len char user type before search, but my app log this: https://gist.github.com/ovnicraft/8528915
[12:54:01] <ovnicraft> as you se the log
[12:54:11] <ovnicraft> its calling before my input has 10 length
[12:54:24] <ovnicraft> i need to add another funct to get work it ?
[12:54:59] <ovnicraft> doc: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-minLength
[12:55:44] <duch_kazatel> ovnicraft you're setting the minLength opion for .ajax, not for autocomplete.
[12:56:16] <BillCriswell> Duh. Totally missed that.
[12:56:24] <duch_kazatel> move that option to before the source option for autocomplete
[13:21:02] <BillCriswell> ovnicraft: Did you get duch_kazatel suggetion?
[13:28:07] <duch_kazatel> BOY IS IT HOPPIN' IN HERE TODAY HOWDY DOODY
[13:37:08] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah. What the hell. Not even the guys who are here every day are here today.
[13:37:15] <BillCriswell> Oh, MLK. Just a guess.
[13:38:40] <duch_kazatel> yeah, lots of folks aren't at work.
[13:38:51] <duch_kazatel> UNLESS YOU'RE ME AN WORKING FOR ECOMMERCE.  hoo boy.
[13:45:56] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I miss ecommerce a bit.
[13:46:07] <BillCriswell> Thinking about building a shopify theme.
[13:46:36] <BillCriswell> I also want to take the time to learn Magento... but that shit is crazy.
[13:48:10] <duch_kazatel> eeeh, magento is okay as long as you adhere to its two rules.
[13:48:39] <BillCriswell> Do you primarily work on a specific platform?
[13:49:50] <duch_kazatel> we used magento for a while and abandoned it.  we have a completely homegrown solution.
[13:49:59] <BillCriswell> Nice.
[13:50:02] <duch_kazatel> we wanted to see if magento could replace it.
[13:50:04] <duch_kazatel> it couldn't.
[13:50:40] <duch_kazatel> don'
[13:50:48] <BillCriswell> Yeah. It's pretty wild.
[13:50:54] <duch_kazatel> *don't get me wrong - our system has its warts, but it's actually a great system otherwise.
[13:51:26] <BillCriswell> Yeah, all systems do. All a matter of finding the right tool for the job.
[13:51:32] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[13:54:33] <pseudonymous> Ok, so I've been trying to grok CORS and whatnot - can anyone explain/justify the rationale of this ? From my perspective, if I want to ruin a person's browser, I just create a forwarding service through which I can add the cross domain header thingie and use that to proxy my malicious JS requests.. why is this obstruction here ?
[13:56:01] <duch_kazatel> pseudonymous huh?
[13:58:18] <duch_kazatel> pseudonymous are you saying that you don't see how CORS protects against a MITM attach?
[13:58:20] <duch_kazatel> *attack
[13:58:33] <pseudonymous> duch_kazatel: I'm trying to consume people's RSS feeds via JS and I'm getting: "'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource". This is apparently boils down to cross-domain requests being a no-no for some obscure reason
[13:59:41] <snover> “some obscure reason” like the fact that this would, for example, allow any arbitrary web site anywhere load up your gmail account and read all your private emails
[13:59:51] <snover> load your bank’s web site and transfer all your money to them
[13:59:58] <snover> and so on and so forth
[14:00:02] <snover> totally obscure
[14:00:13] <pseudonymous> If I sit between you and your domain there's a lot I can do to ruin your day. So long as the communication isn't encrypted you basically cannot trust any header/response in any way. So no, I don't see how CORS can do anything but put up an annoying obstacle to legitimate requests
[14:00:36] <duch_kazatel> pseudonymous "so long as the communication isn't encrypted" - you DO realize how many sites use HTTPS these days, right?
[14:01:27] <pseudonymous> duch_kazatel: I do, but if the communication is encrypted then by that very definition this becomes a non-issue
[14:01:36] <snover> good luck with your man in the middle attack, that’s quite a bit harder than making an xhr request.
[14:01:50] <krambiorix> hi, i have a - i think - stupid problem : http://pastebin.com/kDrPCuTA  -> data.html is a string with a div in it... But that string is never added to the div ....
[14:01:53] <snover> no it doesn’t…
[14:02:36] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Do console.log(data.html) and make sure it's what you think it is.
[14:04:50] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, i did nd it is
[14:05:00] <pseudonymous> Anyway, I am to understand that CORS essentially makes it impossible to write a pure JS feed parser which doesn't rely on a proxy or other intermediary such as google or yahoo's feed parsers - as certain servers will neglect to include a header allowing cross domain requests even though they're completely safe in this respect ?
[14:05:29] <duch_kazatel> pseudonymous you can use JSONP
[14:06:04] <duch_kazatel> well, in some cases you can.
[14:06:27] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Is it just a string?
[14:08:28] <pseudonymous> duch_kazatel: so what, I'm abusing script tags and their ability to fetch cross domain documents (such as js) and then modify the URL to get a handler function to run once the request has completed ?
[14:08:28] <pseudonymous> And what do you mean by "in some cases", exactly ?
[14:10:08] <duch_kazatel> pseudonymous JSONP is a specific technique - some APIs allow you to specify a callback function in the URL request.  this is not a vulnerability, but simply another way to feed data to the frontend.
[14:10:40] <duch_kazatel> your man in the middle attack would require somehow tricking the end user into visiting an inauthentic site.
[14:11:44] <BillCriswell> Later dudes.
[14:11:45] <pseudonymous> Yea, I think I'm just going to suck it up and bounce through via Yahoo or Google's feed reader proxies
[14:11:54] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, yes, just a string
[14:12:00] <BillCriswell> bouncy bouncy bouncy bouncy.
[14:12:02] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, <div> .....</div>
[14:12:16] <duch_kazatel> pseudonymous have an example of one of these feeds?
[14:12:52] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Hard to tell the issue without looking at it. If it's just a string jQuery should be able to handle it properly.
[14:12:59] <pseudonymous> I get the general idea, somewhat. But it's just needlessly annoying to have to resort to such a thing. Is fetching external, non-verified content potentially a security threat ? You beatcha', does it happen in other programming languages ? Yes, most certainly. Are there legitimate use-cases/wants for such a thing ? You're looking at it -_- Grrr.. oh well
[14:13:37] <duch_kazatel> pseudonymous they may also be using this as a way to keep you from pulling the feed for marketing reasons.
[14:16:11] <pseudonymous> duch_kazatel: well.. I'll readily admit to not having a clue why/what I'm supposed to do to massage this into working. But I wanted to fetch a feed, such as http://feeds2.feedburner.com/TheLinuxActionShow --- the problem is I can't be satisfied by only supporting a subset of servers which tack on some random header. I'm trying to read feeds, and not just one or two sources
[14:16:53] <duch_kazatel> so you want to pull http://feeds2.feedburner.com/TheLinuxActionShow.rss?
[14:18:43] <pseudonymous> duch_kazatel: as an example, sure. But in reality I'm trying to cobble together a podcasting application for FirefoxOS and so I really want to read scary XML from third parties I don't know yet
[14:21:55] <duch_kazatel> yeah, that's likely blocked at feedburner not necessarily for security reasons.
[14:23:10] <pseudonymous> duch_kazatel: and this (I imagine) would never be a problem were I not using javascript :( Anyway, I'll bounce through Google/Yahoo's services. I suppose it's either that or setting up my own server :)
[14:23:29] <duch_kazatel> you should setup your own server.
[14:23:43] <duch_kazatel> they likely want analytics on the feeds - they want to know who's hitting it when, etc.
[14:25:03] <duch_kazatel> that's also cheap protection for them - they won't have somebody taking that URL and setting up a simple DDoS with it.
[14:26:54] <pseudonymous> Well, I'm against setting up my own server to proxy requests through for an App I'm really just going to be using myself (and putting up there for others to use). But I'm glad to have determined that while I had little clue how I was supposed to make such a request, it wouldn't pan out either way
[14:27:18] <duch_kazatel> i woulda setup the server myself, but meh.
[14:31:48] <snover> pseudonymous: the browser contains private authentication information (cookies, http auth, etc.) for the third-party that your server does not, so it is a security problem for the browser to make the request, but not a security problem for your server to make the request
[14:34:51] <tables> var musicsearch = \$('[name=\"musicsearch\"]').val();
[14:34:51] <tables> \$.get(\"/profile_apisearch?type=music&apitype=spotify&search=\"+musicsearch, function(my_var) {
[14:34:51] <tables> \$('#summary').html(my_var);
[14:34:51] <tables> });
[14:34:58] <tables> how do i get a load bar when i call .get?
[14:34:59] <pseudonymous> snover: I know, in general terms. But such a thing could equally easily have been achieved by having the browsers allow unauth'ed cross-domain requests or whatever you'd like to label it. And requesting third-party information is always a security risk which could lead to arbitrary code execution. But meh
[14:35:04] <tables> some kinda gif
[14:35:40] <duch_kazatel> tables you mean like an ajax spinner?
[14:35:51] <tables> i think so, yea
[14:36:00] <tables> like a gif that's there, when i call $.get
[14:36:14] <tables> before it posts to $)('summary')
[14:36:18] <tables> before it posts to $)('#summary')
[14:36:29] <duch_kazatel> doesn't look like $.get() properly supports that.
[14:37:14] <tables> what else can i use?
[14:37:17] <duch_kazatel> $.ajax();
[14:37:25] <tables> instead of get?
[14:37:27] <duch_kazatel> yes
[14:37:28] <tables> can you fix my syntax?
[14:37:34] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:38:22] <tables> look at my syntax that i posted
[14:38:29] <tables> it has a bunch of \ but ignore them
[14:38:32] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ - search in the page for url: "http://fiddle.jshell.net/favicon.png" for an example opf what yours might look like.
[14:38:49] <duch_kazatel> that should point you in the right direction.
[14:39:05] <tables> how do i load a gif image when i call $.get?
[14:39:36] <duch_kazatel> you don't "load a gif image" - you'd put a callback in beforeSend that would unhide one all ready on the page.
[14:39:42] <tables> until it posts to ('#summary').html(my_var)
[14:39:49] <duch_kazatel> and then in your complete() callback you hide it again.
[14:41:51] <tables> lemme show you code
[14:41:55] <duch_kazatel> it would look something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/ysf39/1/
[14:42:04] <duch_kazatel> I am not going to rewrite your code for you.
[14:44:05] <tables> http://paste2.org/zWKIzcAH   <-- when i click #submit or when i do .get how can i have a load gif?
[14:44:12] <tables> load gif in #summary i guess
[14:44:19] <tables> i wanna show a load gif
[14:44:20] <duch_kazatel> \
[14:44:29] <duch_kazatel> did you look at the fiddle I linked you?
[14:44:34] <tables> no not yet
[14:44:37] <tables> 1 sec, looking at it
[14:44:40] <duch_kazatel> kay - please do that.
[14:45:01] <tables> i basically want a load gif
[14:45:07] <tables> 1 sec looking at your code
[14:45:54] <tables> duch_kazatel, i'm too new at jquery, is there anyway you can rewrite my fiddle?
[14:46:12] <tables> http://paste2.org/zWKIzcAH
[14:46:28] <duch_kazatel> dude you're in here ALL THE TIME asking for "help", which inevitably winds up in you asking people to rewrite your code.
[14:46:33] <duch_kazatel> this is not hard.
[14:48:06] <Crucials> duch_kazatel sent a pretty simple fiddle to be fair, hard to not get it
[14:48:18] <tables> duch_kazatel, :(
[14:48:29] <duch_kazatel> it has all the basic things in it you need.  i gave you the skeleton, as well as told you how to do it.
[14:48:30] <tables> duch_kazatel, is there anyway you can help me with that code i pasted?
[14:48:42] <tables> i'm too new to jquery, thats why
[14:48:49] <duch_kazatel> then learn jquery?
[14:49:05] <duch_kazatel> why are you writing code if you don't know how to... write code?
[14:49:16] <tables> i don't know how to start, because of my submit
[14:49:35] <duch_kazatel> when I said "use $.ajax()", what do you think I meant?>
[14:49:43] <duch_kazatel> replace your $.get() with $.ajax()
[14:49:52] <duch_kazatel> this is not difficult.
[14:49:52] <tables> oh
[14:50:09] <duch_kazatel> how about this - take a crack at it and put it up on like jsfiddle or something with syntax highlighting.
[14:50:15] <tables> $.ajax({
[14:50:16] <tables>     url: 'http://google.com',
[14:50:16] <tables> 	beforeSend: function() { // This gets triggered before the request is sent.
[14:50:16] <tables> 		$('#yourGif').show();
[14:50:16] <tables> 	}
[14:50:17] <duch_kazatel> i want to see you put in some modicum of effort.
[14:50:24] <duch_kazatel> do not paste into the channel.
[14:50:56] <tables> if i do $('#yourGif').show(); , is it the same as showing my gif when i do a get request?
[14:51:14] <duch_kazatel> if you do it in the beforesend, sure.
[14:51:20] <tables>  url: 'http://google.com       <-- same as GET request?
[14:51:31] <duch_kazatel> did you even try?
[14:51:38] <duch_kazatel> have you tried to do this on your own?
[14:51:58] <duch_kazatel> try it, see if it breaks and, if so, put it in a fiddle and i'll help.
[14:51:58] <tables> way to difficult for me, i'm new to jquery
[14:52:05] <duch_kazatel> this is hwo you learn
[14:52:08] <duch_kazatel> *how
[14:52:24] <duch_kazatel> you will hurt absolutely nothing by trying.
[14:53:33] <tables> duch_kazatel, do i have to use .ajax()?
[14:53:36] <tables> or can i use .get?
[14:53:48] <duch_kazatel> you cannot use $.ajax() to do what you wanbt.
[14:53:52] <duch_kazatel> you haven't even tried dude.
[14:54:03] <duch_kazatel> show me what you have so far in a fiddle.
[14:54:41] <tables> how do i do $('#yourGif').show();     when i call a .get?
[14:54:54] <tables> before or at the same time?
[14:55:08] <duch_kazatel> tables $.get() does not support what you need it do/.
[14:55:08] <duch_kazatel> *to
[14:55:24] <duch_kazatel> what you just pasted is part of the problem.
[14:55:45] <tables> can i just put (#yourGif).show() before i call the .get?
[14:55:54] <tables> before the line that has ".get"
[14:56:01] <duch_kazatel> it won't behave in a reliable fashion.
[14:56:03] <shoky> try it and see, and shut up
[14:56:33] <duch_kazatel> you asked for advice, then discarded it without trying.  at this point, without a fiddle, i will not be able to help/.
[14:57:18] <Crucials> tables, where is this api searching?
[14:57:28] <tables> on my own server
[14:57:53] <tables> when it calls the .get() i just want a load bar when it does
[14:58:13] <duch_kazatel> last time he was in here, he was trying to query spotify's API by sending all of his page's HTML to his server and then kicking the request off from there.
[14:58:38] <tables> probably before it calls the .get() and then when it gets the data, it posts to #summary so after .get() and before .html()
[14:58:41] <Crucials> oh, i was here for that i think
[15:00:13] <tables> so before the .get() and before it puts the .get response in the .html function, is where i want the load bar to occur
[15:01:34] <decx> just put a gif in your #summary html, hide #summary in your css, show #summary as the first line in your click function and be done with it
[15:02:35] <tables> once i call.get(), i want the load bar to occur
[15:02:36] <tables> then post inside #summary (by .html())
[15:02:37] <tables> look at #summary, it's where all the data is posted, but when i call .get(), is where i want the load bar to occur
[15:02:54] <duch_kazatel> tables $.ajax() gives you callbacks to do EVERYTHING you're looking for.
[15:02:58] <tables> decx, can you show me syntax?
[15:03:06] <Crucials> decx: just gave you the (different) answer
[15:03:12] <tables> what's a callback?
[15:03:15] <decx> either you do it the right way like duch_kazatel wrote, or you can go to the ghetto with my "solution"
[15:03:17] <tables> i'm new to jquery and coding
[15:03:26] <duch_kazatel> tables why don't you learn, then?
[15:03:32] <tables> any solution is cool
[15:03:59] <tables> i just wish you guys can fix my code http://paste2.org/zWKIzcAH
[15:04:06] <duch_kazatel> tables we are not here to do that.
[15:04:09] <tables> so thers'a a load in summary when i click the cocde
[15:04:13] <tables> when i click*
[15:04:23] <tables> :(
[15:04:48] <duch_kazatel> we are not a conduit for your wishes and desires - you're asking for free work.
[15:05:56] <decx> aren't you cranky today ^^
[15:06:08] <shoky> duch_kazatel why do you say that not using beforeSend is unreliable?
[15:06:32] <Crucials> tables: Put your "loading" gif inside #summary, but make sure it is hidden with CSS or otherwise. Then right before the $.get, show the gif again.
[15:07:00] <duch_kazatel> shoky I guess that was the wrong word.  to me, the abstraction would be all wrong.
[15:07:04] <Crucials> tables: your .html() will write your result over it, so it will disappear.
[15:07:25] <duch_kazatel> and decx I'm cranky because this dude refuses to actually do his own work.
[15:07:27] <Crucials> tables: then again, you will have to do some extra work if a person wants to search more than once...
[15:12:07] <tables> \$(window).load(function(){
[15:12:08] <tables> \$('#submit').click(function(e){
[15:12:08] <tables> var musicsearch = \$('[name=\"musicsearch\"]').val();
[15:12:08] <tables> \$.get(\"/profile_apisearch?type=music&apitype=spotify&search=\"+musicsearch, function(my_var) {
[15:12:08] <tables> \$('#summary').html(my_var);
[15:12:08] <tables> });
[15:12:10] <tables> });
[15:12:12] <tables> });
[15:12:15] <tables> how do i put a load gif to that?
[15:12:29] <tables> when i do the click, i want a load gif until, it posts to #summary
[15:12:44] <tables> (asking again, lol)
[15:12:54] <decx> you're not helping yourself
[15:13:01] <shoky> tables stop asking and flooding
[15:13:02] <tables> why
[15:13:13] <tables> ?
[15:13:16] <decx> you got a beautiful solution from duch
[15:13:23] <decx> it's all there
[15:13:27] <Crucials> and a ghetto solution from decx
[15:13:31] <decx> go that extra step
[15:13:33] <tables> i'm not good at jquery, that's why
[15:13:40] <tables> i need syntax
[15:13:41] <tables> lol
[15:13:42] <decx> it's quiete literal
[15:13:46] <tables> or coding, in gernal
[15:13:49] <decx> and apparently you can read
[15:13:50] <decx> quiet
[15:14:16] <Crucials> which part of decx's explanation did you not understand?
[15:14:28] <Crucials> just dont post the code again
[15:17:07] <tables> i'm trying again, thanks
[15:25:35] <duch_kazatel> hahaha "you got a beautiful solution from duch"
[15:25:38] <duch_kazatel> well thank you sirs.
[15:25:45] <decx> i just looked at it at was confused
[15:26:06] <decx> where's that hidinng loading element
[15:26:48] <decx> would you have a separate loading dom element that you overlay when you reload full containers?
[15:27:13] <decx> i always add a class to the parent i plan to fill from an ajax request
[15:27:27] <duch_kazatel> in my case, I'd stick a div on the page that acts as a transparent overaly abd put the gif in the middle of that.
[15:27:34] <decx> like before addclass loading
[15:28:01] <tables> http://paste2.org/gNN9eZJ6     <-- can you help me so this works?
[15:29:04] <duch_kazatel> tables do you not see where your problem lies?
[15:29:12] <tables> no
[15:29:16] <decx> hey, he did something
[15:29:23] <duch_kazatel> you have an extra quote after "musicsearch"
[15:31:38] <dllama> hey guys,  anyone here experienced with blueimp's jquery-file-upload?  having some trouble initializing it on a rails app.
[15:31:41] <duch_kazatel> also you had some cruft with your parents/curlies.
[15:31:48] <dllama> when i fund $('#fileupload').fileupload();,  nothing happens
[15:31:52] <dllama> run*
[15:32:46] <duch_kazatel> *parens
[15:32:47] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle.net/X5gJX/
[15:35:48] <decx> i'm gonna assume posting that without the http:// was a delightfully underhanded way of saying: "you're lazy, now i'll have you copy&paste instead of just click"
[15:36:24] <duch_kazatel> >:3 i am that guy who's interested in teaching you things.
[15:38:29] <dllama> jquery-upload anyone? :/
[15:38:41] <duch_kazatel> dllama none of us have used it probably.
[15:45:30] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/LcfPN/1/      <-- how do i put a load gif to this, when i click the button?
[15:45:48] <tables> load gif before it comes out in #summary
[15:46:06] <decx> i see you're back to your get :>
[15:50:22] <duch_kazatel> lolnope.
[15:51:31] <duch_kazatel> no .get()
[15:54:12] <duch_kazatel> tables you saw I fixed up your code, right?
[15:54:23] <tables> yea, i can't understand it fully
[15:54:25] <tables> i'm new to jquery
[15:55:09] <duch_kazatel> go back to the one I just sent you
[15:55:17] <tables> ok
[15:55:29] <duch_kazatel> what don't you "get" about it?
[15:55:43] <decx> it's confusing for a beginner
[15:55:51] <decx> putting stuff you do before not before
[15:55:53] <decx> :>
[15:56:06] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/LcfPN/2/
[15:56:28] <duch_kazatel> seriously i fail to understand what makes my example so confusion.
[15:56:30] <duch_kazatel> *confusing
[15:57:05] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/bfkX8/3/     <-- duch_kazatel why doesn't this one work in the first place?
[15:57:14] <decx> you think on another layer of abstraction that is hard to grasp for people who are not coders (myself included)
[15:57:27] <decx> then again, that ajax example is so easy
[15:57:28] <tables> decx, checking out
[15:57:29] <decx> :>
[15:58:06] <tables> decx, how do i load a load.gif when i click submit?
[15:58:18] <tables> before it posts in #summary
[15:58:21] <duch_kazatel> tables swap to the .ajax() method.
[15:58:27] <duch_kazatel> this is getting old.
[15:59:07] <decx> tables, check the 3rd line, before the request goes out, you write something in summary, that gets then replaced when you get is done
[15:59:13] <tables> oh
[15:59:26] <tables> $('#summary').html('Now Loading');
[15:59:28] <tables> that's all i need?
[15:59:32] <tables> to load a gif?
[15:59:45] <tables> i'm guessing <img src="load.gif"> ?
[15:59:49] <decx> yes
[16:00:08] <tables> but what if the .get() takes some time?
[16:00:10] <tables> to load?
[16:00:26] <duch_kazatel> tables and that's why you use .ajax();
[16:00:26] <decx> that's why you have the gif to keep the people entertained
[16:00:29] <decx> ;)
[16:00:35] <decx> that too ha
[16:00:44] <tables> it seems like it will do "Now Loading" and then when the .get loads, it will change
[16:01:12] <decx> you can put anything in that html
[16:01:20] <tables> i need it to do "Now Loading" while the .get call is loading
[16:01:28] <tables> because it could take some time
[16:01:55] <duch_kazatel> tables $.ajax(); provides everything you need to make that happen.
[16:01:56] <tables> when i click on the button, the now loading button should show WHILE it's doing the .get()
[16:02:03] <tables> duch_kazatel, ok
[16:02:22] <tables> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/LcfPN/2/    <-- is there anyway you can fix that?
[16:02:24] <tables> so it does?
[16:02:32] <tables> i know you sent me syntax for ajax()
[16:02:43] <tables> i'm just bad at jquery
[16:02:58] <talntid> you are bad at trying?
[16:02:58] <duch_kazatel> here, I'll copy your code for you because you're apparently unable to do it yourself.
[16:03:32] <decx> cmon duch_kazatel i nearly had him satisfied
[16:03:44] <decx> now in an hour it's :how do i put a load gif to this,
[16:03:55] <decx> ;D
[16:04:31] <decx> it pains you physically to see one function split up like that
[16:04:35] <decx> ^^
[16:04:57] <Crucials> I can't believe you're still doing this :D
[16:05:28] <decx> it's more entertaining than the [smarty] on my other screen
[16:05:49] <Crucials> the last jsfiddle seemed to be working. whats wrong?
[16:05:51] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/LcfPN/3/ THAR I FIXED IT HURRK THAT WAS HARD.
[16:06:08] <duch_kazatel> Crucials he wants to have a spinner setup that'll show while the request is running.
[16:06:52] <tables> duch_kazatel, thansk alot
[16:06:52] <Crucials> duch_kazatel: so why was the other fiddle not good? Replacing "now loading" with a spinner
[16:07:06] <duch_kazatel> his version was using $.get();
[16:07:10] <duch_kazatel> he really wants $.ajax();
[16:07:22] <Crucials> sure
[16:08:13] <duch_kazatel> this same dude was trying to literally send his entire page's HTML as query string parameters to his backend.
[16:08:22] <duch_kazatel> at this point, there is no reasoning.
[16:08:57] <decx> oh was that with the tables?
[16:09:03] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[16:11:53] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/LcfPN/4/      <-- how do i put the ajax request in #summary
[16:11:55] <tables> ?
[16:12:41] <decx> you had in in your first attempt
[16:12:48] <decx> remember myvar?
[16:13:04] <decx> now the success function doesnt have myvar but loadedContent
[16:13:28] <tables> this one is better?  -->
[16:13:35] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/LcfPN/2/
[16:13:46] <tables> it loads the gif while the request?
[16:14:01] <decx> back to get i see
[16:14:03] <tables> er i mean, loads the "Now Loading"
[16:14:11] <decx> it must be an elaborate social experiment
[16:14:22] <duch_kazatel> yeah this dude is trolling at this point.
[16:14:57] <tables> no i'm not trolling
[16:15:05] <tables> i'm just very bad at jquery
[16:15:19] <tables> i just want my load gif or load text to work when i hit that submit
[16:15:20] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/LcfPN/5/
[16:15:24] <duch_kazatel> what does this not do?
[16:15:26] <synth_> you'll get the hang of it.
[16:17:35] <tables> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/LcfPN/5/    <-- why doesn't it show the url?
[16:17:39] <tables> inside #summary?
[16:17:51] <tables> it just goes to 'Now lOADING'
[16:18:00] <tables> 'Now Loading' *
[16:18:16] <duch_kazatel> tables why do you want the URL to display?
[16:18:31] <tables> i want the contents of the URL to display in #summary
[16:18:32] <decx> cant request crossdomain without additional work
[16:18:42] <tables> and while the contents are loading, i want it to say "Now Loading"
[16:19:00] <tables> oh, crossdomain
[16:19:04] <tables> what would be on the same domain?
[16:19:26] <decx> loadedContent holds the content of the url you request in your ajax
[16:21:46] <tables> it won't load :(
[16:23:00] <duch_kazatel> tables -> http://i.imgur.com/ZpkRwOw.png
[16:23:29] <tables> what is that?
[16:24:16] <duch_kazatel> tables are you expecting to just be able to use jsfiddle like that?
[16:25:05] <tables> no, i'm trying to query my own server
[16:25:19] <tables> but i need example in jsfiddle so i just tried a http://jsfiddle.net/blah/show
[16:25:28] <tables>  /foo/show
[16:25:46] <tables>  /foo/5/show
[16:25:47] <duch_kazatel> are you looking at the network panel and watching your requests?
[16:25:47] <tables> or whatever
[16:25:55] <tables> yea
[16:26:07] <duch_kazatel> and what do you see?
[16:26:24] <tables> ah
[16:26:26] <tables> i see a request
[16:26:29] <tables> one sec, lol sorry
[16:26:31] <duch_kazatel> and in the response?
[16:27:32] <tables> #request# GET http://jsfiddle.net/B7EUY/1/show/
[16:27:43] <duch_kazatel> and what do you see in the response body?
[16:27:44] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/LcfPN/5/   <-- from that code
[16:28:29] <duch_kazatel> tables did you try this on your server?  filling in the url correctly?
[16:28:31] <tables> duch_kazatel, not sure
[16:28:38] <tables> not yet
[16:28:55] <duch_kazatel> GIVE IT A SHOT BUDDY :(
[16:29:29] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/LcfPN/5/     <-- line 11, is the syntax wrong?
[16:29:53] <tables> why is it musicsearch?
[16:29:54] <tables> lol
[16:30:09] <duch_kazatel> because that's what you had?
[16:30:31] <tables> it should be the whole .get() response that i get from ajax: call
[16:30:41] <tables> it's not working
[16:30:42] <tables> duch_kazatel,
[16:30:44] <tables> lol
[16:30:55] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/LcfPN/6/
[16:31:04] <tables> i want it to post the whole html of http://jsfiddle.net/B7EUY/1/show/
[16:31:14] <duch_kazatel> tables you cannot do that.
[16:31:36] <tables> can i do that only on my server?
[16:31:41] <duch_kazatel> sure why not.
[16:31:51] <duch_kazatel> try it in the real world.
[16:32:21] <tables> it won't work on my server too
[16:32:24] <tables> and i don't know how to debug it
[16:32:31] <duch_kazatel> waht does the network tab say buddy?
[16:32:36] <duch_kazatel> is CORS enabled?
[16:32:36] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[16:32:38] <tables> that ajax call should work from any domain too i think
[16:32:54] <duch_kazatel> only if the server allows it.
[16:33:16] <tables> look at the code in the jsfiddle you sent me
[16:33:18] <tables> it won't work
[16:33:28] <tables> it just goes to "Now Loading" when i press the button
[16:33:28] <duch_kazatel> it'll work if the server responds to ajax requests.
[16:34:00] <tables> one sec, asking someone if ajax requests work on the same server jsfiddle.net
[16:34:30] <duch_kazatel> lol i like how ypou're over in ##javascript now.
[16:34:41] <tables> haahaha
[16:34:46] <tables> how do i get  $.ajax({
[16:34:46] <duch_kazatel> they're not going to appreciate you pasting code like that.
[16:34:48] <duch_kazatel> fyi.
[16:34:50] <tables>         url: 'http://jsfiddle.net/B7EUY/1/show/',
[16:34:52] <tables> to work on jsfiddle.net?
[16:37:09] <tables> why doesn't :   http://jsfiddle.net/B7EUY/1/show/         show up in the code?.
[16:37:12] <tables> i know it should
[16:37:16] <tables> because it's on the same domain
[16:37:27] <duch_kazatel> tables because not every server allows you to send/recieve AJAX like that.
[16:37:29] <tables> it should probably show up even if it's a different domain, cuz ajax call
[16:37:42] <duch_kazatel> oh okay then we're all dumb and you know what you're doing.
[16:37:46] <tables> because it's an ajax call*
[16:37:46] <duch_kazatel> congrats you win the internet.
[16:37:53] <tables> :(
[16:37:55] <tables> plz help me
[16:38:17] <tables> can you get http://jsfiddle.net/LcfPN/6/   to work?
[16:38:22] <tables> with the submit button?
[16:38:31] <duch_kazatel> did you modify my example and try it on your server?
[16:38:50] <tables> i like how 'Now Loading' loads before the ajax call shows up in #summary
[16:39:01] <tables> lemme try
[16:39:06] <tables> 1 sec
[16:39:15] <tables> why doesn't it work on fiddle?
[16:39:19] <tables> i've seen ajax calls work on fiddle
[16:39:19] <tables> lol
[16:39:31] <tables> well, atleast i think did*
[16:39:34] <duch_kazatel> i sent you a screenshot of the request body.
[16:39:37] <duch_kazatel> kthx
[16:39:44] <decx> i'm gonna add to the confusion

[16:39:56] <decx> like oil into fire
[16:40:06] <duch_kazatel> you are an evil, evil man.
[16:40:08] <duch_kazatel> i give up.
[16:40:11] <duch_kazatel> dude does't want to try.
[16:41:32] <Crucials> does jquery have its own json api?
[16:41:36] <Crucials> does that question even make sense
[16:41:37] <tables> decx does that work?
[16:41:53] <tables> putting that gif before like that?
[16:42:07] <duch_kazatel> err, huh?  Crucials?
[16:42:11] <tables> does it work at the same time it loads/B7EUY/1/show/
[16:42:12] <tables> ?
[16:42:21] <penibelst> I’ve written a Jquery plugin. I have a small demo page already and a one page documentation. Now I want to improve the API description and the documentation by spreading it over multiple pages. I’m familiar with Jekyll and want to build the website with it. My questions: (1) Should I put the unminified js on the demo site, so people can debug the demos? (2) Should I put the built archive in the download area so people don’t have to i
[16:42:21] <penibelst> their environment?
[16:42:24] <decx> no, i used magic to make it appear
[16:42:24] <tables> it loads /B7EUY/1/show/*
[16:43:52] <Crucials> duch_kazatel: I was hoping you would be able to decypher what im trying to say for me
[16:45:34] <duch_kazatel> Crucials JSON is JavaScript Object Notation - not sure what jquery could do for you there.
[16:46:18] <Crucials> duch_kazatel: something that I can actually pull out of jquery's site and display it in table's jsfiddle
[16:46:59] <decx> penibelst 1 yes, 2 maybe?
[16:47:03] <duch_kazatel> oh, yeah. $.ajax() has a json datatype
[16:49:06] <penibelst> decx: thanks. What means “2 maybe”? Do you mean people don’t need to install all my demos to understand how the plugin works?
[16:50:14] <decx> well if you wanna be overly penibel, than by all means put it in. but as someone who uses plugins, i don't give a damn about anything but options and a min.js ^^
[16:50:32] <decx> then*
[16:51:37] <penibelst> decs: I understand. Should I provide a min.js at all? Or is it up to users to minify the plugin?
[16:52:03] <duch_kazatel> provide a min and non-min
[16:52:21] <penibelst> duch_kazatel: thanks
[16:52:38] <duch_kazatel> we use the non-min version during development and then minify ourselves at my work.
[16:52:45] <duch_kazatel> but by provided both, you let people choose.
[16:53:27] <decx> btw what's the latest on minify all for fewer request vs separate files
[16:54:11] <duch_kazatel> we minify separately so we can only load the plugins we need on each page.
[16:54:13] <penibelst> Yesterday I compared the speed of Jquery’s CDN and Github’s one. Github’s one is 2 times slower in my region (Germany).
[16:54:37] <decx> ye github penetration for cdn is too low in de
[16:56:30] <penibelst> decx: one request from a *different domain* can be costly, over 100 ms. Fewer request from the same domain wins.
[17:02:32] <decx> penibelst what's your plugin about anyway? gib gib gib
[17:03:16] <decx> btw duch_kazatel i think my ridiculous load oneliner did the trick, i havent seen "how do i put gif in here" for a while
[17:04:26] <penibelst> decx: https://github.com/penibelst/imadaem I want to reconstruct it to only use CSS for styling
[17:04:40] <duch_kazatel> decx you're a bad person who should feel bad.
[17:05:01] <decx> i regret nothing........... *jumps into pit*
[17:05:45] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[17:06:05] <decx> sweet penibelst i might use that
[17:07:27] <decx> lazy loading with an extrem low res start. nice idea
[17:08:48] <penibelst> decx: Thanx. It will be even easier to style since all you need is CSS to style image’s size ans appearance.
[17:08:57] <penibelst> *and
[17:11:23] <decx> penibelst how's timthumb.phps caching?
[17:14:44] <penibelst> decx: It caches all the image data in one folder. I would like to have a replacement, so apache would serve the cached files derectly from the filesystem, without the PHP overhead.
[17:17:07] <penibelst> decx: In the version 1.0 my plugin will not depend on Timthumb, so you can use whatever resizer you want.
[17:17:23] <decx> cant you do that with a mod_rewrite? if the file exists you just grab it and if not you put timthumb between
[17:17:59] <decx> i should note that my experience with rewrite halts at redirecting old urls ;)
[17:18:16] <penibelst> decx: No, Timthumb saves the data in a intermediat format with MD5-based file names.
[17:18:42] <decx> ah
[17:19:33] <penibelst> decx: technically Timthumb is not well written, but it has all the functions I need.
[17:21:07] <penibelst> decx: Every other ready to use solution I’ve found lacks some of required functions.
[17:22:13] * penibelst has to sleep
[17:22:55] <penibelst> Bye and thank you for advices.
[17:23:27] <decx> tschö
[17:46:09] * vinex08 write less... do moar...
[17:48:50] <duch_kazatel> yup
[17:50:41] <FLOSSMASTAP> what is this and why do I see it all over the place? (function($)
[17:50:48] <BillCriswell> FLOSSMASTAP: Haha.
[17:50:53] <duch_kazatel> it's an IIFE.
[17:50:59] <BillCriswell> It's short for document ready.
[17:51:17] <duch_kazatel> it's a shorthand way to do a document ready AND helps create scope.
[17:51:34] <BillCriswell> You shouldn't be seeing it THAT much.
[17:51:39] <BillCriswell> In your own code, at least.
[17:52:00] <BillCriswell> Transgender Dysphoria Blues tomorrow yessssssss.
[17:52:05] <duch_kazatel> wat
[17:52:23] <duch_kazatel> oh an album.
[17:52:29] <BillCriswell> An album from my favorite band.
[17:52:34] <FLOSSMASTAP> good album
[17:52:59] <BillCriswell> FLOSSMASTAP: Listening to it on NPR now. Looking forward to listening to it on the trail ride into work.
[17:53:11] <duch_kazatel> the last album i could get excited about was Mayer Hawthorne's "Where does this door go"
[17:53:14] <BillCriswell> on the train*
[17:54:37] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I'm always excited for their album releases. The lead singer came out as a woman recently and this is the first album since that. Looking forward it a lot.
[17:54:49] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah
[17:57:37] <FLOSSMASTAP> BillCriswell & duch_kazatel thanks
[17:57:43] <BillCriswell> FLOSSMASTAP: No problem!
[17:57:52] <duch_kazatel> 'swhat we do.
[17:58:05] <BillCriswell> Uhn tis.
[17:58:09] <FLOSSMASTAP> (note to duch_kazatel : I am normal (i.e. not a troll) in productive channels)
[17:58:23] <duch_kazatel> hahahah i kind of figured.
[17:58:30] <floatingpoint> so, what does this mean jQuery.fn.center
[17:58:51] <duch_kazatel> that means that's a jquery function called "center"
[17:59:05] <duch_kazatel> generally means you can call it on a "jquery object", like $('#selector').center();
[17:59:18] <floatingpoint> oh
[17:59:27] <floatingpoint> ok. that sounds kosher
[18:01:18] <duch_kazatel> my coworkers know me all to well at this point.
[18:01:39] <duch_kazatel> one of them said "i just had to write a jquery .each() - did you feel that?!"
[18:03:24] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i give up for the day.
[18:03:52] <decx> but it's so handy :<
[18:03:55] <BillCriswell> That must have been hard on you.
[18:04:17] <duch_kazatel> .each() makes me sad :(
[18:04:44] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[18:04:48] <duch_kazatel> it's so slow.
[18:04:58] <duch_kazatel> anyway i hope you all enjoy.  g'night.
[18:17:58] <frnic> hello
[18:20:24] <frnic> If I get the version of jquery from github, do I have to build it to use it for myself, or does "building" it only make a .min version and I can use the version I DL if I am happy with the performance?
[18:20:44] <frnic> uh, that should be jquery ui
[18:36:02] <BillCriswell> The build tool should give you everything you need.
[18:36:15] <BillCriswell> Like the zip you get when you customize the download.
[18:46:33] <frnic> But, if I don't want to customize the download - if I just want the entire library for now, Do I still need to build it?
[18:48:39] <mdev> how come .change(function()  doesn't fire with key presses?
[18:48:51] <mdev> only after I make the thing lose focus does it detect change
[18:50:00] <BillCriswell> mdev: Might need to use keyup.
[18:51:43] <mdev> I tried keypress and it does't detect change unless I enter 2 characters...
[18:51:52] <mdev> 1 single character doesn't make it fire :/
[18:52:26] <BillCriswell> How about keyup?
[18:52:51] <mdev> works perfect in chrome thankyuo
[18:52:52] <mdev> you
[19:00:49] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[19:26:19] <d3m0n> Can someone direct me to a small tutorial on adding a small delay when hovering a menu but only when it's not over another menu item
[19:27:57] <d3m0n> ie: when a user hovers over the menu item and directs his mouse to the menu underneath but incase his cursor goes outside of the element it disappears instantly because its prue CSS
[19:33:26] <BillCriswell> d3m0n: You can google hoverIntent I think it's called?
[19:33:39] <BillCriswell> d3m0n: http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[19:34:31] <BillCriswell> d3m0n: Also, an awesome read here: http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-dropdown
[19:34:49] <BillCriswell> With an even awesomer plugin.
[19:35:03] <decx> yeah that one is nice
[19:36:39] <d3m0n> BillCriswell I did look at the hoverInt examples and such but it looks like it just delays all the menus drop downs
[19:37:18] <decx> take the one from the article
[19:37:25] <d3m0n> I want something a bit smarter, where it knows if it's another menu item to retract instantley otherwise delay which seems like it would be fairly easy
[19:37:31] <d3m0n> Checking now
[19:37:33] <decx> though i havent used hoverintent
[19:37:39] <decx> but menu-aim is like magic
[19:37:44] <decx> to me at least ;)
[19:38:19] <BillCriswell> Yeah, menu aim is the most awesome people 99% of people would never notice.
[19:38:34] <BillCriswell> most awesome plugin*
[19:39:04] <d3m0n> hahaha
[19:39:15] <d3m0n> but appericiate
[19:39:41] <d3m0n> Yes menu-aim looks like what I am looking for, thanks guys
[19:39:52] <BillCriswell> d3m0n: No problem.
[19:40:17] <BillCriswell> The comments on that article are awesome. The original creator of the pattern comments on it.
[19:43:50] <Crucials> That was a cool read
[19:59:13] <zumba_addict> hey guys, my friend needs a way to connect to a local Microsoft Access file. Any ideas?
[20:00:48] <snover> jump off a bridge

[20:12:50] <brandonzhu> (function($)..oh,just saw it...
[21:47:16] <arvind_khadri> Hi, I am having an issue with using jquery ui dialog. If a dialog has not been initialized how can I check for that?
[22:06:26] <brandonzhu> May I ask a question? what does $.get return....like $.get(..).status is undefined
[22:06:40] <teufelChiCoder> hi everyone
[22:07:03] <brandonzhu> :)
[22:10:24] <Uhkis> brandonzhu: you need to setup a variable which holds the data returned from the get request
[22:11:12] <morfin> is there a way to handle click to anywhere but my plugin component(select)
[22:11:45] <morfin> as somebody said it's not best idea to use $("*") to bind click
[22:12:20] <innociv_> $('body').not('select').click() perhaps
[22:12:26] <brandonzhu>  Uhkis: yup, i try that
[22:12:30] <innociv_> Not sure about the .not, but if you want to register a click anywhere bind it on body
[22:12:40] <teufelChiCoder> in jquery ui multiselect, how can i require that at least one of the checkboxes need to be selected?
[22:16:09] <morfin> what will happen if i do this: $(document).on("click.linkselect","*:not([linkselect=true])",function(){...});?
[22:16:50] <morfin> will it be same as like $("*:not([linkselect=true])").on("click.linkselect",function(){...});
[22:25:58] <teufelChiCoder> n jquery ui multiselect, how can i require that at least one of the checkboxes need to be selected?
[22:27:39] <morfin> hmmm
[23:20:10] <xqo> hi, line 19 never happens.. i cant find out why! there is nothing in the console either! http://jsfiddle.net/b82tS/
[23:20:15] <xqo> oh wait
[23:20:18] <xqo> .tab is a generated item
[23:20:23] <xqo> oooooh. nvm
[23:21:09] <xqo> you use .ready() to counteract that right?
[23:21:57] <xqo> or on
[23:21:58] <xqo> maybe
[23:22:49] <grafi> on

[23:25:47] <xqo> http://jsfiddle.net/HcwaY/
[23:25:53] <Cork> $(parent).on('click', '.tab'
[23:26:08] <Cork> uh
