[00:12:25] <geoid> greetz
[00:12:53] <geoid> what's wrong with my closure function here? http://jsfiddle.net/DzyvY/
[00:55:21] <theBrettman> thx luke
[00:57:22] <lowerkey> Greetings, all. Does someone know why in this example, http://jsfiddle.net/herrturtur/gerCE/ the last accordion panel (Other > Salad) displays a scrollbar instead of displaying in full size?
[00:58:03] <theBrettman> for some reason, I can't get ui to work in jsfiddle and it's enabled...
[01:01:00] <AllTuna> I'm using .show(500), how come my element kind of.. bounces
[01:01:16] <AllTuna> it drops down say 20px, then pops up another 4
[01:01:18] <AllTuna> 5*
[01:01:31] <AllTuna> but when it pops up its rapid and in the last second
[01:02:41] <coldhead> ?demo @ AllTuna
[01:02:41] <bot-t> AllTuna, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:02:56] <AllTuna> Well, it's live
[01:03:01] <AllTuna> but it requires logging in
[01:03:05] <AllTuna> Do you mind?
[01:03:07] <coldhead> gross
[01:03:12] <AllTuna> I have a guest user + pass
[01:03:17] <coldhead> i can't commit to a whole login session
[01:03:23] <coldhead> i'm sorry
[01:03:24] <AllTuna> :(
[01:03:27] <coldhead> i've been drinking
[01:03:30] <AllTuna> Sigh
[01:03:31] <AllTuna> fine
[01:03:36] <AllTuna> i'll take away the authentication
[01:03:36] <AllTuna> haha
[01:03:46] <coldhead> good lad
[01:03:47] <AllTuna> wait, but i cant
[01:03:54] <AllTuna> because the values are taken from the database
[01:03:56] <AllTuna> its a profile page
[01:04:00] <coldhead> well i'm pouring another drink anyway
[01:04:11] <Eviltwin> What are you drinking?
[01:04:12] <AllTuna> itll be quick? please? :D
[01:04:28] <AllTuna> simply http://bidfornews.com/internetchefdev/login.php
[01:04:28] <coldhead> i'll try
[01:04:29] <AllTuna> then
[01:04:30] <AllTuna> http://bidfornews.com/internetchefdev/profile.php
[01:04:41] <coldhead> leftover wine, Eviltwin
[01:04:49] <AllTuna> username: Guest, password: guest1
[01:05:33] <coldhead> and how do i make the bug happen?
[01:05:41] <AllTuna> The email address edit button
[01:05:46] <AllTuna> it brings down the confirmation
[01:06:04] <AllTuna> You see how it 'pops' ?
[01:06:16] <coldhead> body {overflow:hidden}
[01:06:27] <coldhead> HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE SEEING THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE PAGE HERE TUNA
[01:06:36] <coldhead> THIS IS TAKING LONGER THAN PROMISED
[01:06:38] <AllTuna> well, you see that was because of another error :(
[01:06:40] <AllTuna> okokok
[01:06:44] <AllTuna> i'll disable that
[01:07:09] <AllTuna> done
[01:07:10] <coldhead> i see it
[01:07:29] <coldhead> oh my sweet lord
[01:07:33] <coldhead> you are using onclick
[01:07:41] <coldhead> it's like being back in the 80s
[01:07:54] <AllTuna> :\
[01:08:00] <coldhead> i'm sure you'll be back for more bugs about that later
[01:08:05] <coldhead> LET ME PRESS ON
[01:08:06] <AllTuna> well
[01:08:11] <AllTuna> there are 2 bugs for you to find
[01:08:14] <AllTuna> the one I told you about
[01:08:17] <AllTuna> and theres another ;)
[01:08:22] <AllTuna> its a surprise ;)
[01:08:51] <coldhead> YOU PROMISED THIS WOULDN'T TAKE LONG
[01:08:57] <AllTuna> it wontt
[01:09:07] <AllTuna> you saw the 'pop' bug?
[01:09:12] <coldhead> i am going to take a pill which usually makes me collapse and start twitching
[01:09:18] <coldhead> so i may not finish this project
[01:09:20] <AllTuna> haha please dont
[01:09:33] <coldhead> where is the javascript that your onclick runs
[01:09:48] <AllTuna> bottom of the page
[01:09:58] <AllTuna> edit()
[01:10:07] <coldhead> 3000 characters, 10 lines of code
[01:10:10] <AllTuna> $("#liEmailConfirm").show(500);
[01:10:17] <AllTuna> thats ma bug line, i assume
[01:10:17] <coldhead> this is not especially readable
[01:10:20] <AllTuna> thats what drags down the box
[01:10:41] <AllTuna> hahaha
[01:10:45] <AllTuna> wow, why is it like that?
[01:11:05] <AllTuna> shall I paste?
[01:11:20] <coldhead> i wouldn't worry about that
[01:11:25] <coldhead> i am starting to twitch
[01:11:30] <AllTuna> :(
[01:11:39] <AllTuna> pull through
[01:11:57] <AllTuna> http://jsfiddle.net/R5U8F/
[01:12:07] <AllTuna> thats my edit() function which the onCliks use
[01:12:32] <AllTuna> everything works perfectly, except for the popping done by that one <li>
[01:12:43] <coldhead> i think that might be related to the display
[01:12:52] <coldhead> jquery likes display:block
[01:12:56] <coldhead> and display:none
[01:13:10] <AllTuna> hmm lemme try
[01:13:13] <coldhead> not display: list-item
[01:13:18] <lowerkey> http://jsfiddle.net/herrturtur/gerCE/
[01:13:19] <Eviltwin> AllTuna: I think you missed the point of making a demo
[01:13:26] <Eviltwin> It's that it's a demonstration
[01:13:29] <Eviltwin> Not just a pastebin
[01:13:48] <lowerkey> does someone know why the last accordion-content starts scrolling?
[01:13:53] <coldhead> i got the working demo, Eviltwin
[01:14:00] <coldhead> because i am the poor bastard that logged in
[01:14:04] <AllTuna> hahaha :p
[01:15:15] <coldhead> it might not even be that, AllTuna
[01:15:18] <Eviltwin> lowerkey: It has a height: 0px for some reason
[01:15:19] <coldhead> that's just my hunch
[01:15:54] <lowerkey> Eviltwin: I saw that, but digging through the source, I don't see where it happens
[01:16:13] <AllTuna> coldhead, hmmm, well I haven't explicitly made anything display: list-item, at least, I can't remember doing so
[01:16:43] <AllTuna> also, if you expand the bottom two elements, the boxes below "information", it contracts information, however the page has a scrollbar for a second
[01:18:00] <coldhead> it has a scrollbar all the time for me
[01:18:29] <AllTuna> eww
[01:18:31] <AllTuna> really?
[01:18:38] <AllTuna> horizontal or verticle?
[01:18:45] <AllTuna> and does it all fit on the page?
[01:19:21] <coldhead> vertical
[01:19:27] <coldhead> and i thought you enabled that for me
[01:19:41] <coldhead> i am a normal person with a modest screen
[01:19:43] <coldhead> ANYWAY
[01:19:59] <coldhead> can you move all that JS out of the end of the file and into a dedicated javascript file
[01:20:02] <AllTuna> Yes, but it shouldn't scroll, I disabled it because when you expand the other elements it scrolls the page for me, even though it all fits
[01:20:05] <coldhead> show some respect for the javascript, man
[01:20:13] <coldhead> then we can use the debugger
[01:20:29] <AllTuna> Well, that is a good idea, and I will do that
[01:20:31] <coldhead> i am sure you will end up debugging this yourself
[01:20:38] <coldhead> and that is a good start :D
[01:20:39] <AllTuna> But I don't think its that, I think it's the CSS
[01:20:59] <coldhead> i think it's the css too!
[01:21:06] <coldhead> ut the css is being animated by the javascripts
[01:21:09] <coldhead> it's a tangled web
[01:21:29] <coldhead> i am getting another drink
[01:21:35] <coldhead> and my chess board
[01:21:44] <AllTuna> yes, that should help
[01:22:12] <lowerkey> EvilTwin: How do I get rid of the height: 0px?
[01:22:17] <AllTuna> Lets just try stop the page from scrolling, why is it :9
[01:22:18] <AllTuna> :(
[01:23:07] <Eviltwin> lowerkey: http://jsfiddle.net/gerCE/1/
[01:24:23] <lowerkey> Eviltwin: Cool, how did you do it/what changed?
[01:24:32] <Eviltwin> lowerkey: Hint: Order matters
[01:24:45] <coldhead> i have other criticisms, AllTuna
[01:24:56] <coldhead> who wants to fill out a form asking my household income?
[01:24:58] <coldhead> nobody
[01:25:21] <AllTuna> That's why tis optional
[01:25:32] <coldhead> even stupid people won't fill it out!
[01:25:36] <AllTuna> its a recipe/shopping website
[01:25:44] <coldhead> yes i noticed
[01:25:47] <AllTuna> may help decide preferences
[01:26:00] <coldhead> oh the class war? i've heard of that >: |
[01:26:01] <lowerkey> order matters...
[01:26:03] <coldhead> NOT A FAN
[01:26:05] <AllTuna> In either case, its what my lame employer wants :\
[01:26:22] <coldhead> you need better employers, AllTuna
[01:26:27] <Eviltwin> lowerkey: Open your version and mine and scroll to the bottom
[01:26:28] <AllTuna> Its my first :P
[01:27:01] <lowerkey> I see now
[01:27:05] <lowerkey> Thanks Eviltwin
[01:28:45] <coldhead> where is this reset.css from AllTuna?
[01:30:07] <AllTuna> coldhead, someone recommended it to me ages ago so I started using it
[01:30:27] <AllTuna> Also, The 'popping' bug has something to do with this http://pastebin.com/A8Hutc2n
[01:30:38] <AllTuna> when I remove that, it doesnt pop
[01:31:34] <AllTuna> float:right
[01:31:37] <AllTuna> thats the problem
[01:31:47] <AllTuna> Looks like Im changing them to position: absolute
[01:32:51] <coldhead> so you fixed it yourself!
[01:32:56] <AllTuna> Yay :)
[01:33:04] <coldhead> i'm going to reward us by having more wine
[01:33:11] <coldhead> good work, AllTuna
[01:33:21] <AllTuna> although, uch, making it position: absolute makes the textboxes relative to the text beside it, so I cant just make it margin-left: x;
[01:33:26] <AllTuna> and haha, good idea
[01:36:46] <disappearedng> Is there a good way to test client code
[01:43:48] <AllTuna> coldhead, I need to get the textboxes to appear in the exact same position as they are now, without using float: right
[01:43:49] <AllTuna> any ideas?
[01:43:54] <AllTuna> no floats work
[01:47:14] <coldhead> i no understand
[01:47:43] <AllTuna> by removing float: right, the .show() doesnt bounce anymore
[01:47:55] <AllTuna> however, if I remove float: right, the positioning of my textboxes are haywire
[01:48:43] <coldhead> so don't position them with floats?
[01:48:51] <coldhead> you have weird stuff here
[01:49:01] <coldhead> like margin's of 350+ pixels
[01:49:14] <coldhead> it's way too gomfusing for me
[01:49:16] <AllTuna> How else would I do it..
[01:49:39] <coldhead> to get those icons all over at the right?
[01:49:51] <coldhead> i would make a <div class="icons"></div>
[01:49:54] <coldhead> and position that
[01:50:00] <coldhead> float it probably
[01:55:38] <AllTuna> I just cant figure out how to position these textboxes without using float: right
[01:55:55] <AllTuna> using absolute positioning doesnt work because theyre relative to the text beside them..
[02:02:03] <disappearedng> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8960306/testing-javascript-on-client-end if someone can help I will really appreciate it
[02:05:15] <red_square> disappearedng - qunit, jasmine, phantomjs
[02:05:38] <disappearedng> you know what the problem is
[02:05:42] <disappearedng> if I run qunit
[02:05:45] <disappearedng> I need to mock a server
[02:06:03] <disappearedng> it is a bit hard to run like that
[02:06:50] <red_square> just use integration tests then - selenium, phantom
[02:07:03] <disappearedng> that's browser dependent
[02:07:13] <disappearedng> can I just run js code?
[02:08:54] <red_square> whats the issue with browser dependency like in phantom
[02:09:49] <disappearedng> actually
[02:09:53] <disappearedng> let me think
[02:09:56] <red_square> your node tests has a server dependency, the server where the tests run
[02:10:52] <disappearedng> so right now I am getting the following error: halfway through my service, my browser doesn't update the right dom
[02:11:08] <disappearedng> 1) I am already writing tests for the server by using nodeunit so I know for sure the server runs fine
[02:12:07] <red_square> yeah I meant the dependency bit
[02:12:12] <disappearedng> so I believe to simulate the correct situation, I would have to do the following: 1) Set up a server so I can get to the error point, 2) have the server fire a packet, 3) assert that the client code behaved correctly when they received that packet
[02:12:28] <red_square> or mock the packet
[02:13:57] <disappearedng> so red_square how would you go about testing my thing
[02:14:42] <disappearedng> note I am only doing testing because it literally is taking me a minute to set up the conditions to get to the error point and everytime when I change my client code I have to manually repeat that which is really irritating me
[02:16:45] <red_square> well I tend to use selenium webdriver
[02:17:20] <red_square> you could try something like https://github.com/appendto/jquery-mockjax
[02:17:25] <red_square> to mock the server api
[02:17:38] <red_square> to isolate the client only
[02:18:05] <disappearedng> well I can for certain mock the server side which wouldn't be hard
[02:18:33] <disappearedng> can I also mock $(document).ready?
[02:19:09] <red_square> dunno, i never use it
[02:19:39] <red_square> all my scripts render before closing body tag to avoid the need for doc ready blocks
[02:20:16] <red_square> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1800818/unit-testing-jquery-document-ready-function
[02:21:46] <disappearedng> actually I might be overthinking
[02:22:05] <disappearedng> to be honest when I look at my source code, all I need to do is set up a mock socket with the right configs
[02:22:48] <disappearedng> create a bunch of mocks, then send a fake packet and make sure that the right behaviour is executed
[02:53:34] <vy> Hi! What do you guys recommend/use as a jQuery OOP framework?
[02:56:34] <MadawarDawar> backbone.js
[03:04:16] <vy> MadawarDawar: Any beginners guide? Or am I expected to dive into http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/ as is?
[03:05:35] <MadawarDawar> yeah but be careful with it as it as if you should go through the entire documentation first before you grasp what it all about but for me this is the best framework
[03:07:57] <Collins> Hello people
[03:09:01] <Collins> Guys I have a seemingly simple question that I would like help with
[03:09:13] <Collins> Anyone open to help?
[03:10:02] <Collins> 800 plus people online but not one single word :(
[03:10:56] <Collins> Hello!!!
[03:11:20] <vy> Collins: Just ask.
[03:12:34] <xanopti> hi
[03:13:01] <Collins> vy: Thanks :). My question, i am working on a mobile sms solution but can't pay for a dedicated SMS short code, if I use a shared Short code, is it possible to not allow the owner of the short code access to my database?
[03:13:39] <Collins> xanopti: hi
[03:13:51] <xanopti> hi collins
[03:14:32] <Collins> vy: I am worried about the owner of the short code, sharing or giving out my data. How do i protect that?
[03:15:19] <Collins> xanopti: Have a small issue, read my earlier chats, can you help?
[03:15:27] <Linex> replace() lets me make changes to the whole document(g) but I can make changes for one thing. If I have 10 different replacements, I have to parse the document 10 times.
[03:15:28] <Linex> I thought its better if I parse the document line by line, and make 10 changes on each line.
[03:15:58] <rue> Collins: You mean your data in their database?
[03:15:59] <nicholasschulz> Why do the "guiding text" show up once you click any field? I want it to show up when you click on password and retype password.. http://jsfiddle.net/nicholasschulz/86Bd3/2/
[03:16:11] <rue> That'd depend on their T&C and local legislation.
[03:16:33] <Collins> rue: I am building my own database. Been collecting the data for months
[03:17:06] <rue> You're worried they'd log the codes and use them to access your service?
[03:17:45] <Collins> Yes, I plan to get my own short code in a couple of months but want the service to start now
[03:18:15] <Collins> so I have to use a shared short code..
[03:18:41] <nicholasschulz> collins: They will probably have access to your data in theory. Like rue said, it depends on local legislation wether or not they are allowed to look at it..
[03:19:24] <rue> Or, not knowing your particular use case, perhaps you can just expire the codes near-immediately after use or something of that nature
[03:19:45] <rue> I don't think that's a problem jQuery can help you with, though :)
[03:20:19] <Collins> rue: I know.. all the relevant channels had ideal members ;)
[03:20:31] <Linex> Which is better ? replace.()ing the whole document 10 times or replace()ing each line 10 times ?
[03:20:36] <Collins> Thanks guys, this was very helpful
[03:20:44] <Linex> Better as in faster and more effiecient.
[03:20:57] <Linex> Better as in faster and more efficient.
[03:21:19] <rue> Almost certainly the document, if you do it in a batch
[03:21:39] <nicholasschulz> Why do the "guiding text" show up once you click any field? I want it to show up when you click on password and retype password.. http://jsfiddle.net/nicholasschulz/86Bd3/2/
[03:22:03] <rue> But if all the elements don't need to be updated simultaneously, then replacing smaller bits would be better.
[03:22:14] <nicholasschulz> Collins: What short code are you wanting to use? Im looking for this same service myself.
[03:23:14] <Linex> rue: so for a 1000 line document where I need to make 10 changes to each line. Its better to replace() the whole document 10 times than to replace() each line 10 times ?
[03:23:31] <standoo> best way would be run an experiment
[03:23:37] <rue> This doesn't sound like a real use case.
[03:26:08] <Linex> rue: ok, the real use scenario is 6 changes to each line. Its about highlighting(color,bold,underline,etc) kinda of thing.
[03:27:00] <rue> Are the changes all at once, or do they happen at intervals, or sporadically?
[03:27:23] <Linex> rue: all at one.
[03:28:00] <Linex> I got the whole chunk of html ready and certain keywords need to be highlighted.
[03:29:00] <Linex> so its not really a matter of how to do it but which is more 'right' as in faster to do it.
[03:29:31] <Linex> interesting, isn't it ?
[03:29:55] <rue> Mm, client-side highlighting does pose more of a challenge
[03:30:53] <rue> It'd likely be the better option to update piecemeal, but I've no useful data on this.
[03:32:22] <Linex> I can do it server-side php, but I thought I let the server not work too hard since this is more of estatics.
[03:33:09] <Linex> aesthetics
[03:35:29] <Linex> rue: which will be faster in your opinion, whole document or line by line, 10 lines. I'll have to do benchmarking to find out the truth.
[03:35:32] <nicholasschulz> Why do the "guiding text" show up once you click any field? I want it to show up when you click on password and retype password.. http://jsfiddle.net/nicholasschulz/86Bd3/2/
[03:36:09] <rue> Linex: I still think it'll be faster to replace the doc, but there's probably a memory tradeoff which may or may not be significant
[03:38:08] <Linex> rue: hasn't anyone done this kind of benchmarking before. It will be interesting to see.
[03:39:38] <rue> I'm sure someone has
[03:39:58] <rue> nicholasschulz: I dunno about that, but you could change your selector to only affect the input[type=password] elements
[03:50:08] <nicholasschulz> rue: thanks for the tip, but i found the problem… i had if (id = 'pw') { // SHOW } …. Had to change it to if (id == 'pw') { // SHOW }
[03:52:15] <rue> Ah, the old thingaroo, didn't get that far.
[03:52:21] <rue> There's something to be said for yoda conditionals
[03:52:41] <rue> Though JS is crazy enough that  if("pw" = id)  might actually work
[04:13:46] <nicholasschulz> Why don't this work? if ($('#pw_first').val().length >0<5) { alert('Too short'); }
[04:14:09] <nicholasschulz> It alerts even though #pw_first.length=0
[04:22:10] <aro> can you access jquery objects in a parent window?
[04:36:31] <red_square> nicholasschulz because you need a && statement
[04:36:56] <nicholasschulz> >0 && <5 ?
[04:37:01] <red_square> no
[04:37:26] <red_square> var pwLength = $('#pw_first').val(); if (pwLength > 0 && pwLength < 5)
[04:37:35] <red_square> oops
[04:37:44] <red_square> var pwLength = $('#pw_first').val().length; if (pwLength > 0 && pwLength < 5)
[04:37:52] <nicholasschulz> k, thanks :-)
[04:39:53] <Dreamstar> Hi guys
[04:40:21] <Dreamstar> Is it possible to fetch data from a database in real time? Like a "real time search"?
[04:41:39] <Dreamstar> ?jquery real time search
[04:41:40] <bot-t> Dreamstar, .data() - Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[04:47:49] <pom> Why does $(this).before($(this)); remove the element? Shouldn't it create a copy of itself before itself?
[04:53:08] <nicholasschulz> $('#'+ id).css('background-color','#edfff1','border-color:','#000');           the BG color changes, the border-color don't… why?
[04:53:51] <nicholasschulz> I removed the ":" and it still don't work..
[04:55:29] <pom> nicholasschulz: Try .css('background-color','#edfff1').css('border-color','#000');
[04:56:51] <nicholasschulz> it worked. thanks. but theres got to be a way to keep it all in one single css(); ?
[04:57:39] <pom> nicholasschulz: Yes. See http://api.jquery.com/css/#css2 concering .css( map )
[04:57:59] <aro> can jquery grab variables from iframes
[04:58:14] <pom> But you should probably consider putting your desired changes in a class and change the layout with addClass() or similar.
[04:58:31] <pom> If you are having a lot of properties.
[05:00:59] <nicholasschulz> yes.. I only have two props
[05:02:02] <DawnSpirit> +
[05:02:40] <nicholasschulz> When I add properties (not classes), can I use removeClass(); to remove all of the styling?
[05:08:59] <red_square> no
[05:09:25] <red_square> could remove the style attribute I guess, never tried
[05:29:55] <aro> i am doing this in an iframe: 	var window.parent.oldcontent = $('<div>').append($('#current-popup').clone()).remove().html(); // But i get an error : Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token .
[05:31:04] <rindolf> aro: I don't think you can use "var" with properties.
[05:31:21] <red_square> yup
[05:34:02] <aro> oh ok
[05:37:01] <aro> how can i set a variable in the parent window? i removed the var, and it got rid of the token error - but i still get an error saying that 'oldcontent' is not defined
[05:38:56] <skamikaze> aro: use a fn inside top frame to set sth from inside the iframe
[05:39:08] <aro> ok
[05:39:13] <skamikaze> top.foo('bar');
[05:40:26] <aro> okay cool
[05:43:24] <aro> now i get this error: Resource interpreted as Other but transferred with MIME type undefined.
[05:53:32] <inki> hi
[05:53:58] <inki> I'm having trouble binding events to elements in jquery mobile
[05:56:25] <johanhar> 7wc
[06:01:12] <_ramo> hi
[06:01:22] <_ramo> what exactly does this function: http://privatepaste.com/cc4b06b227/fewf34 ?
[06:03:48] <_ramo> i mean, what does the $.map do with the data and the callback function?
[06:11:55] <cwillu> _ramo, similar to a for loop to build up a new list:  the function is called with each item of the original list in turn, and each return result gets appended to a new list
[06:15:11] <_ramo> cwillu: thank you... can you explain what this is doing: return $li.append(a).data('item.autocomplete',  item.value).appendTo(ul); i mean the data section?
[06:15:21] <_ramo> can i add more parameters to the data section?
[06:15:49] <cwillu> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[06:15:59] <nicholasschulz> should you strip variables before sending them through ajax?
[06:16:04] <cwillu> erm http://api.jquery.com/data/
[06:18:20] <_ramo> cwillu: my current issue is, that i'm using the jquery ui autocomplete... i get my data for a autocompletion list, but if i use my push button (e.g. the down button), the id of the shown element is inserted into the search input field... but i need the whole label of that element. if i add $li.append(a).data('item.autocomplete',  item).appendTo(ul); the id of that element is inserted into the search input field, if i do a $li.append(a).data('item.au
[06:28:00] <inki> i have this jquery mobile stuff: http://nopaste.me/paste/17256981774f1c1cdc8cfd0
[06:28:33] <inki> how do I bind an event on the select
[06:34:02] <inki> i tried $('#select-choice-1').on('update', function() { alert('yo'); });
[06:34:12] <inki> doesn't work
[06:34:33] <fris> use .bind()
[06:35:40] <inki> i thought bind() was deprecated in favor of on()
[06:37:20] <inki> but with bind(), it doesn't work either
[06:41:46] <inki> this stuff renders something like <a class="ui-link-inherit" href="#">Paarberatung</a>- I wonder how I get /paarberatung into this href
[06:47:18] <mightym> hey guys, I'm setting up a css style via .css({ 'transform': 'rotate(120deg)'})  … i wonder how i could remove this completely? should i set it to 'none' or to '0deg'? or is there a query way to remove the style completely?
[06:48:22] <rindolf> mightym: there should be.
[06:49:07] <inki> anyone any ideas to my mobile issue?
[06:49:22] <mightym> rindolf: means there is none, but you wish there would be one? :)
[06:50:16] <rindolf> mightym: no, I mean I would be surprised if there wasn't one.
[06:51:54] <mightym> rindolf: hmmm, ok. that problem is i can't put the style into a class cause i need to random generate the degree number in it in the client
[06:55:19] <AitchisonJ> Anyone know how I can use .load() again with content I have already loaded with this function?
[06:55:27] <inki> ok, I do it inline now: <select name="select-choice-1" id="select-choice-1" data-native-menu="false" onchange="$.mobile.changePage($(this).val());">
[06:55:30] <inki> ugly, but works
[06:55:36] <inki> i think it's a page load timing issue
[07:30:46] <AitchisonJ> Is anyone able to tell me why .load() isn't working correctly with content that's just been loaded with this function? Example here: http://www.affinitypw.com/v2/  thanks
[07:32:49] <tash> in a  function of mine, I'm setting var recordId = $(this).attr("rel"); ... can I somehow make recordId global so I can use it in other functions?
[07:41:10] <inki> ok, I have <span class="foo">bar</span>, and I can't bind any event to it
[07:41:58] <inki> with jquery mobile
[07:42:10] <tash> how are you trying? I'm not a jquery expert though, I'm still a newb :P
[07:42:24] <tash> but maybe rubber ducking it might help ...
[07:42:38] <inki> i have an external js with <script type="text/javascript" src="/_js/base-mobile.js"></script>
[07:42:53] <inki> and there I go $('span.tel').bind('tap', function() { alert('yo'); });
[07:43:10] <inki> i tried bind, live, on as well es tap and click
[07:44:37] <tash> why not, $('.foo').bind....? idk, like I said I'm a newb, but to connect to something with a class you use dot ( . ) and something with id you use the hash ( # ). But you probably already know that.
[07:44:44] <tash> and, I'm probably unhelpful :P
[07:52:52] <tash> if you have a textbox and you want the log whatever is typed in it ... is this the right way to get that value? $('#id').val();
[07:53:52] <inki> tash: span.tel should be all spans with class tel
[07:54:49] <tash> ini: but the span you showed didn't have class tel
[07:54:50] <tash> right?
[07:54:57] <tash> inki^, sorry
[07:55:10] <tash> it had class foo
[08:01:34] <black_warlock> which is the last version of mysql server DB ?
[08:03:52] <tash> black_warlock: odd question for #jquery ... but it's 5 dot something
[08:04:17] <inki> tash: sure, but in my code it's tel
[08:04:22] <nicholasschulz> This is a PHP question. I need a password for #php… :-( Why won't my page redirect with header? http://jsfiddle.net/nicholasschulz/t2vQ3/
[08:04:50] <tash> inki: gotcha
[08:05:05] <black_warlock> hum
[08:05:09] <black_warlock> its not
[08:05:19] <black_warlock> PHP question ?_?
[08:05:44] <tash> black_warlock: 5 dot something isn't the latest?
[08:05:58] <nicholasschulz> black_warlock: 5.0.32
[08:06:00] <tash> you should ask in #mysql if you want to find out for sure
[08:06:09] <black_warlock> why ? Mysql runs only with php  ? Or can run with vb, python, php, cgi
[08:06:37] <tash> black_warlock: this isn't #mysql ... not trying to be a jerk, but you'd be better served by joining their channel IMHO
[08:06:40] <black_warlock> ty
[08:07:01] <nicholasschulz> theres a big difference between php expertise and mysql expertise… thats why they have their own channel @ black_warlock
[08:07:06] <Susikov> MySQL Community Server
[08:07:06] <Susikov> (Current Generally Available Release: 5.5.20)
[08:07:17] <tash> +1, nicholasschulz
[08:07:26] <black_warlock> lol man this is general and easy question for a webmaster
[08:07:48] <tash> who said anything about being a webmaster? :P
[08:07:53] <black_warlock> ty nicholasschulz
[08:08:07] <nicholasschulz> oh ur welcome :-)
[08:08:25] <nicholasschulz> +1, tash :-p
[08:08:53] <Susikov> nicholasschulz, 5.0.32 is latest mysql? I've missed something? http://www.mysql.com/downloads/
[08:08:54] <black_warlock> means that if you are on jq channel you should be a webmaster, jq is not used to cook eggs .....or yes ?
[08:09:22] <nicholasschulz> susikov: my bad. i assumed my web host had my back but no…. :-(
[08:09:28] <black_warlock> hu ho its 5.5
[08:09:44] <Susikov> may be it's latest available out-of-box apt release in Ubuntu 8.04:))
[08:09:55] <nicholasschulz> black_warlock : you don't need a web server do run jquery.....
[08:10:06] <nicholasschulz> you only need a .html file
[08:10:12] <nicholasschulz> and a .js of course
[08:10:43] <Susikov> well, actually I user jQuery and mongodb. no mysql
[08:11:05] <Susikov> sorry, use of course
[08:12:01] <Susikov> anyway, does it makes sense to discuss mysql on jquery channel?:)
[08:12:09] <black_warlock> ofc
[08:12:28] <_ramo1> does anyone of you has an tip for this issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8962383/jquery-ui-autocomplete-push-button-and-display-issues ?
[08:16:01] <black_warlock> its easy thing
[08:18:20] <black_warlock> labels ?
[08:18:34] <tash> I'm launching a jqui modal form on click ... how can I get the value of a textbox in my modal form?  Here is my code http://pastie.org/3231561 . I want the value of id="descrip" from the form ( line 6 of pastie ).  I've tried $("#descrip").val(); but no dice. Maybe I was putting that in the wrong place in my jq.  I want to be able to alert it or console.log it when I click on the Update button in js, line 30-33 or so in pastie
[08:19:33] <black_warlock> are you sure there are labels in the json string ?
[08:22:39] <tash> $("#id").val(); is the correct way to get the input typed into a textbox right?
[08:25:05] <red_square> yes
[08:25:44] <tash> then I guess I'm just putting that in the wrong place in my code ... did you see my previous question + pastie?
[08:26:19] <red_square> nope, reading
[08:27:09] <io> hi which function to use if i want to trigger an action depending if i am on a certain URL ?
[08:27:55] <io> that should happen at page load like : if the URL is /myurl then load and fadeIn this
[08:28:24] <red_square> tash have you got multiple modals?
[08:28:37] <tash> no
[08:28:43] <red_square> and duplicate id's in the page
[08:30:05] <tash> you are on to something
[08:30:09] <tash> I think I do have doop id's
[08:30:15] <tash> this is old code I inherited
[08:30:19] <tash> and I just noticed that, thanks
[08:30:21] <tash> trying to fix now
[08:30:57] <red_square> cool
[08:31:50] <inki> with jquery mobile, can I trigger an event that leads to opening the phone app with a number?
[08:35:37] <rikkus> If you click a tel: link in the browser, you get the phone app with that number.
[08:35:39] <rikkus> So I'd expect you can.
[08:35:48] <rikkus> I'm talking Android here. Not sure if this works on other platforms.
[08:36:20] <rikkus> I'd try making a link something like <a href="tel:12345">Phone me baby!</a>
[08:36:37] <tash> red_square: don't think it was duplicate id's.  I changed the id to something that doesn't exist in the file, and still no dice.
[08:36:57] <rikkus> and then call click() on the element
[08:37:47] <tash> n/m
[08:38:05] <tash> red_square: maybe I'm just dumb
[08:39:08] <tash> I was doing aler(recordId,invDescrip); which was only alerting recordId ... I then changed my alert to just alert(invDescrip);  and it worked ... so I guess you can't alert multiple items like you can console.log multiple things? I'm just a newb, so maybe that was a no brainer.
[08:40:29] <nicholasschulz> task try (recordId','invDescrip)
[08:40:36] <nicholasschulz> tash
[08:41:14] <nicholasschulz> assuming the two are variables
[08:42:43] <tash> they are
[08:42:44] <tash> one sec
[08:43:45] <tash> didn't work, but that's ok...dont need it to
[08:43:48] <tash> it was only for debugging
[08:44:17] <nicholasschulz> ok
[08:48:48] <Aidanie> How would I select all h2 elements with class 'hello'? I've tried $('.hello'); , $('#h2.hello'); but both do not return anything but []. What am I doing wrong?
[08:49:21] <destryalhmns> $('.hello'); does it
[08:49:27] <destryalhmns> can you post the code?
[08:49:36] <Aidanie> destryalhmns: One sec...
[08:49:46] <tankblergh> hi, I have a question about MVC viewmodel to javascript. I've used  @Html.Raw(Json.Encode(Model.soundfileList)); The soundfileList is a collection of different variables.  The resulting object in javascript looks like this: {"NodeId":51802,"DocumentId":226,"Src":"../Audio/info_tuesday.wav"}, {"NodeId":51803,"DocumentId":227,"Src":"../Audio/info_wednesday.wav"}. How do I easily turn this back into a an object with properties?
[08:55:31] <Aidanie> destryalhmns: Discovered why it wasn't working, my mistake!
[08:55:40] <Aidanie> destryalhmns: thanks
[08:56:17] <destryalhmns> np
[09:07:12] <tankblergh> I found something called json.parse(), but I get an error saying "unexpected character", unfortunately, it doesnt say which
[09:07:47] <tankblergh> does it mean it's not a proper json obekct?
[09:09:13] <rue> That'd be very likely
[09:10:16] <red_square> tankblergh are you outputting that in response to an ajax request
[09:10:42] <red_square> or as part of a html response
[09:11:52] <rue> The JSON needs to be {…} or […]
[09:17:08] <io> hi i need to get and use a variable, my variable is (xxx) here: http://pastebin.com/Q97cZXwE
[09:19:18] <rue> Construct the string
[09:20:13] <tankblergh> red, the latter, not using ajax here.  rue, interesting, the string starts with [{, so it's both
[09:20:52] <red_square> tankblergh - why not just output it in a script block direct into a js var
[09:20:52] <rue> That doesn't matter, I just meant it can't e.g. be "1" by itself
[09:22:03] <Linex> I think the $.get function automatically, trim() the parameters send. Can anyone confirm that ?
[09:24:49] <io> there was an error, now this one: http://pastebin.com/BNP6Ad3K
[09:26:40] <tankblergh> red, I do that already, if I understand you correctly, I have <script .. etc>   var soundfileList = @Html.Raw(Json.Encode(Model.SoundFileList));</script>
[09:27:39] <red_square> tankblergh can you pastebin that line as it appears on the client
[09:28:08] <tankblergh> certainly
[09:30:22] <red_square> tankblergh so is soundfileList not an object then on the client?
[09:30:50] <red_square> you can then iterate this to get at your nodes
[09:32:34] <tankblergh> i tried the easiest way, to see how smart it was, I'm not very experienced with js..for (var item in soundfileList)
[09:32:41] <tankblergh> and the item is just a number then
[09:34:21] <red_square> paste what I asked and i can show u
[09:35:10] <tankblergh> http://pastebin.com/AniPSDib
[09:37:47] <_ramo1> how can i add text to an input field?
[09:38:03] <red_square> tankblergh http://jsfiddle.net/YtLnm/
[09:38:11] <_ramo1> text :)
[09:38:12] <red_square> open your console to see the output
[09:38:33] <px12> _ramo1: $(selector).text("my text"); :)
[09:38:40] <px12> or no..
[09:38:42] <poppiez> hi guys. I'm creating an image gallery where the user can change between images. one of the galleries has around 300 images. problem is, the browser caches each image so when you near the 100-200th image it uses a lot of memory, which makes the page transitions slow and laggy. any way to handle this? I'm on mobile broadband so I might get disconnected
[09:38:42] <px12> it should be
[09:38:47] <px12> .val("my text"); :)
[09:39:12] <tankblergh> red, wow, that was easy, thanks :)
[09:39:22] <red_square> np
[09:39:43] <px12> poppoez: just setup your server to send headers which tell the browser not to cache the images.
[09:40:35] <poppiez> px12: right, ok. no way of handling this client-side?
[09:41:20] <px12> well.. i know we can add meta tags to html pages for disabling cache.. but i dont think this can be done for images on the client side.. you have to send cache control headers from the server itself
[09:42:02] <poppiez> px12: alright thx :) great input
[09:42:27] <px12> :)
[10:03:23] <jcp_> drawing a blank here. anyone remember the company that released an open source jquery plugin that create a really cool looking investor page… something you put on your site for potential investors to look at?

[10:21:53] <Engin> i need an object to pass around
[10:23:19] <rikkus> In the jquery docs, e.g. http://api.jquery.com/click/ - there is no discussion of what a callback function will be passed. Is there a good place to look for this sort of thing? I have written myElement.click(function(e) { .... now, what does e provide? .... });

[10:24:45] <red_square> yup
[10:25:42] <rikkus> thanks :)
[10:26:16] <_ramo1> hm, so, for setting text i should use text() ?
[10:26:54] <red_square> depends what the element is
[10:27:20] <_ramo1> red_square: it's a input text
[10:27:28] <red_square> then val
[10:28:10] <io> red_square: i made it much more simple, but how to get to a specific part of the page when I am .load a variable? http://pastebin.com/RWnNBLSF
[10:28:33] <_ramo1> red_square: so for a <input type="text" class="searchfield" /> i would write $('.searchfield').val("this is a text"); ?

[10:31:23] <red_square> yeah
[10:32:13] <io> red_square: mm isn t that creating something like myurl/#content ?
[10:32:24] <red_square> no
[10:32:29] <red_square> notice the space
[10:32:42] <red_square> its loading that url into the #content element
[10:33:34] <io> red_square: i want to load the #content div found in url inside #mydiv
[10:33:42] <discoverly> I'm trying to create a hover effect where the user hovers over the #parent-div, and a #child-div "slides out" of the top right corner.  My problem is that the children of the #child-div don't animate, only the #child-div itself slides away - can anyone help?
[10:34:51] <red_square> io - makes no sense?
[10:35:04] <Badoskie> Hello
[10:36:40] <io> red_square: it is not loading the #content div, it is loading the whole page (url)
[10:38:05] <red_square> io - are you sure there is a content div, is the html valid?
[10:39:31] <io> red_square: yes I ve jus ttried with a fiex entry instead of the url variable and it loads correctly
[10:40:00] <discoverly> Is there any way to use a parent div as "masking layer" for a child div, so that when I animate the top position of the child div, it slides out of view of the user?
[10:42:09] <discoverly> To see an example, go here: http://voostmedia.com/discoverly/ then click search (don't need to fill anything out) and hover over the only result

[10:45:31] <malikmasr> $.getJSON
[10:46:00] <red_square> malikmasr so your server responds with json?
[10:46:26] <malikmasr> red_square, yes i believe i have the php replying with json
[10:46:36] <malikmasr> the issue for me now is getting the jquery to recieve it
[10:46:54] <red_square> so you pass getJson a callback function
[10:46:55] <malikmasr> im a bit of a noob with jquery, so its been a nightmare lol, im trying to do a simple script and ive been working on it for 3 weeks
[10:47:10] <red_square> where you iterate over your object, or template ir etc etc
[10:47:20] <red_square> eeek
[10:47:40] <malikmasr> my php simply is retrieving a row, and echoing it in json encoded format back to my js
[10:47:52] <malikmasr> but then i cant figure out how to receive it
[10:48:04] <red_square> in the callback function
[10:48:07] <malikmasr> basically im trying to make my portfolio populate form the database
[10:48:12] <malikmasr> yes, the callback function
[10:48:16] <malikmasr> from*
[10:48:37] <red_square> $.getJson(url, function(jsonObject){ //do something with jsonObject here });
[10:48:38] <_ramo1> red_square: can i alert the class name of an input field  ?
[10:49:15] <red_square> _ramo1 yes $('#id')[0].className
[10:49:34] <malikmasr> red_square, that part i believe i have correct, the object being passed back is a row from mysql
[10:49:35] <_ramo1> red_square: and if i have no id?
[10:49:35] <_ramo1> :)
[10:49:38] <malikmasr> stored in an array
[10:49:45] <malikmasr> how can i print the first item of that array then?.
[10:49:52] <red_square> _ramo1 then you have to select it somehow
[10:50:06] <red_square> loop the object malikmasr
[10:51:57] <red_square> malikmasr like http://jsfiddle.net/YtLnm/
[10:52:48] <malikmasr> ty red_square, let me try it, see if it works
[10:54:31] <malikmasr> red_square, i can do a simple for? i thought i would have to use .each for jquery
[11:00:21] <red_square> no, jquery each is slow, a good old js for loop is just the ticket
[11:10:12] <FFForever> Hi ya
[11:12:00] <io> red_square: i ve been trying a different things but can t get it to work properly, http://pastebin.com/G62kH3Pk now i am creating a new variable with the div target before using it in the .load function
[11:12:31] <red_square> u need a space io
[11:12:41] <red_square> var urldiv = url + ' #content'
[11:13:25] <io> i am using a space
[11:13:48] <FFForever> Is there a simple way to ajax load content via ajax and animate the content via a slide up?
[11:14:37] <imsky> yes
[11:15:00] <io> red_square: i don t understand where do i need a space?
[11:15:08] <red_square> after the url
[11:15:16] <red_square> before the id of the element you want to load in
[11:15:32] <red_square> your paste did not have a space
[11:15:53] <_ramo1> red_square: do you use the jquery ui autocomplete plugin?
[11:16:11] <red_square> _ramo1 I have in the dim and distant past
[11:16:36] <io> red_square: weird, the spaces are there
[11:16:52] <red_square> in the href attribute?
[11:17:11] <io> var urldiv = url + '#content'
[11:17:23] <red_square> where is the space in the string
[11:17:33] <red_square> var urldiv = url + ' #content'
[11:17:44] <red_square> space after the ' before the #
[11:18:00] <_ramo1> red_square: can you have a look at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8962383/answer/submit
[11:18:03] <_ramo1> i'm not getting it
[11:18:34] <io> red_square: tx, i am feeling pretty dumb right now...
[11:19:01] <red_square> io, dont hard to see a single space sometimes with all the script:)
[11:19:30] <Zauberfisch> what is the best way to trigger a callback when an iframe is ready? (same orign)
[11:20:03] <Zauberfisch> i tried $('iframe').load(callback); but that seems to be called before
[11:20:33] <Zauberfisch> (my iframe comes via ajax)
[11:20:45] <red_square> Zauberfisch can you add some js to the bottom of the iframe to trigger an event in the container
[11:21:08] <Zauberfisch> I was hoping to avoid that, its code for a framework
[11:22:41] <red_square> Zauberfisch will the load + a little breather (setTimeout) not do?
[11:23:02] <Zauberfisch> hmmm, setTimeout :S
[11:23:31] <Zauberfisch> that does not feel cleans
[11:23:35] <Zauberfisch> *clean
[11:23:55] <red_square> Zauberfisch not sure you will find a clean x-browser solution
[11:25:30] <_ramo1> red_square: do you have an idea on my stackoverflow question?
[11:25:43] <red_square> _ramo1 would be better if i could see it - what is displayed in the label
[11:27:26] <red_square> _ramo1 why not use the .data like the demo page does
[11:27:41] <_ramo1> red_square: what do you mean?
[11:28:27] <red_square> well the example sets .data('bla')._renderItem
[11:29:06] <_ramo1> red_square: you mean on the return statement?
[11:29:46] <_ramo1> you mean something different
[11:29:52] <_ramo1> i don't know whre you refereing to
[11:35:18] <shoelessone_> Hi all
[11:35:50] <shoelessone_> I have a question! Is jquery mobile actually any good/well reviewed as a viable framework to use?
[11:36:33] <io> next step, add a loader event, so that my user knows that some content is loading, is there a function that check for the .load is stil loading and tells me when it s done?
[11:36:40] <k_89> shoelessone, i have seen this nick somewhere else .. also everyone .. is there  a free jquery lightbox+slideshow plugin which is aware of screen size, so that it shows content appropriately
[11:36:54] <red_square> Try it shoelessone, lots of reviews out there
[11:37:33] <red_square> io - yes - use .ajax and use the beforeSend and complete callbacks to show/hide your animations
[11:37:47] <red_square> ? beforeSend @ io
[11:37:48] <bot-t> io, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:38:02] <shoelessone_> I know, but I was wondering if there is a general "theme" - some people seem to love it because it's easy, bit it also seems sort of restrictive and even on my new iPod touch the performance is not totally smooth
[11:38:39] <k_89> io, if you want to show the same animation, you can use ajaxStart, ajaxStop
[11:39:02] <k_89> ? ajaxStart @io
[11:39:03] <bot-t> io, .ajaxStart(handler): Register a handler to be called when the first Ajax request begins. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/
[11:39:07] <red_square> ^^ yup but that applies to all ajax requests in your app
[11:39:08] <k_89> yo baby
[11:39:14] <shoelessone_> k_89: Hmm... Here? [M]?
[11:39:31] <k_89> whois shoelessone
[11:39:39] <red_square> ;)
[11:39:57] <shoelessone_> Oh, and by "theme" I mean to reviews, like yes jquery mobile is pretty nice as an idea, but not very practical...
[11:40:12] <k_89> shoelessone_, no,are you on #codeigniter, #wordpress, #fuelphp, #laravel
[11:40:17] <shoelessone_> Are there any larger implementations of jquery mobile by real companies?
[11:40:31] <red_square> shoelessone_ \i see mixed reviews about them all tbh
[11:41:31] <shoelessone_> k_89: yes... Im normally just shoelessone but im signed in at work I think' and am on my iPad
[11:42:11] <io> does tha tmean that i need ot replace .load with jQuery.get()?
[11:42:22] <k_89> shoelessone_, one thing which helps a lot in building nice UIs is observables ... if you can drop jquery .. dojo has nice support for them, with jquery, you can use knockout
[11:42:43] <k_89> nice == functional
[11:43:40] <Zauberfisch> red_square thanks for your input on that iframe thing
[11:43:57] <red_square> Zauberfisch what is the decision?
[11:44:49] <Zauberfisch> red_square still thinking, but i guess its gonna be a script inside the iframe
[11:57:57] <Zauberfisch> red_square turns out .load() works
[11:58:05] <Zauberfisch> I must be doing something wrokg
[11:58:24] <Zauberfisch> because this works: http://paste2.org/p/1879577
[12:02:27] <red_square> Zauberfisch are you reloading the same iframe over
[12:02:45] <Zauberfisch> red_square no, my problem was even more stupid
[12:03:10] <Zauberfisch>  jQuery(this).load(function(holder) { ... }(someOtherObject));
[12:05:24] <red_square> :)
[12:05:59] * Zauberfisch is stupid
[12:06:59] <Whirl3d> I am starting my first facebook app and was hoping to get some input: is node.js a good platform to work with? My options are node.js, php, python, and ruby. I have js and php experience. Any suggestions?
[12:07:54] <io> Zauberfisch: i guess nobody here is stupid just because he/she is here.... i understand the feeling though
[12:08:27] * Whirl3d is stoopid, if that helps
[12:09:38] <Zauberfisch> io yeah, I consider my self a little smarter than most people around men, but its that feeling when you waste hours trying to solve a problem that had such an easy solution, and such a stupid mistake
[12:09:47] <Zauberfisch> *men => me
[12:10:25] <Whirl3d> spend about 10 minutes in here (especially when Eviltwin is around) and that feeling will become second nature.
[12:10:33] <io> Zauberfisch: i spent an hour looking for a lost space
[12:11:48] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, and others in here, can take something that I spent days of frustration writing pages of code and they can knock it out, better than I ever could, in about 15 lines. It's both depressing and impressive.
[12:12:38] <sona> jquerymobile issue: http://www.tnf.fi/test , trying to execute javascript on "pagecreate" on the first link "acura", not working for some reason, any clues ?
[12:13:09] <Eviltwin> I think "depressingly impressive" is the right way to say that
[12:31:49] <chee> coldhead: wake up
[12:36:50] <destryalhmns> .closest goes in the wrong direction?
[12:36:55] <Eviltwin> ?
[12:36:59] <destryalhmns> sry im lonely
[12:37:08] <Eviltwin> Closest gets the closest ancestor that matches the selection
[12:37:22] <destryalhmns> it does, it should go up the file not up the logical tree
[12:37:30] <Eviltwin> No, not it shouldn't
[12:37:36] <destryalhmns> YES IT SHOULD!
[12:37:56] <Eviltwin> In JavaScript, there's not a "logical tree" there's an actual fucking tree
[12:37:58] <FFForever> Is it possible to get the #lipsum in a url?
[12:37:59] <Eviltwin> It's called the DOM
[12:38:27] <destryalhmns> #lipsum?
[12:38:41] <FFForever> for instance index.html#lipsum
[12:38:52] <Eviltwin> window.location.hash
[12:40:23] <mzulinsky> unique PSD TEMPLATE for corporate website FOR SALE, simply & clean & fresh. More prv me.
[12:40:50] <Eviltwin> mzulinsky: Don't try to sell stuff here, please
[12:42:09] <mzulinsky> okey
[12:45:30] <hypnoseal> Can anyone talk with me about setting a delay on a function so that it cannot be called again for a certain period? For example, I have an animation function that is called on a .click().  If the user calls that function repeatedly and quickly it screws up my other functions that have delay or setTimeout associated with them.
[12:45:49] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/PPNBW/1/
[12:46:23] <hypnoseal> Thanks!
[12:46:33] <MrTrick> I need to validate a field that needs to be a valid regex. Do you think as a validator this would work? Or is there something that could cause problems? function(value) { try { new RegExp(value); return true; } catch(e if e instanceof SyntaxError) { return false; } }
[12:47:20] <Eviltwin> I think that'll work fine
[12:47:25] <rikkus> Yes looks good to me.
[12:47:42] <rikkus> A purist would say 'No! You're using an exception for control flow!'
[12:47:58] <rikkus> But that's because there's no RegEx.TryParse(), like there shouldbe.
[12:48:07] <MrTrick> hypnoseal: seems doable - I suppose the easiest thing to do is remove the click handler on calling the function, and call setTimeout to re-add it after a period of time.
[12:48:26] <Eviltwin> It's funny that regexes aren't regular
[12:48:26] <destryalhmns> .exec() returns null doesnt it?
[12:49:37] <rikkus> Eviltwin: they are...
[12:49:59] <Eviltwin> You can have nested parens
[12:51:03] <MrTrick> the only trouble might be that the regexes are being validated by the javascript regex engine... but they'll be used by the php regex engine. ^_^ Can't do much about that.
[12:51:10] <rikkus> Eviltwin: they meet this definition: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language
[12:51:39] <destryalhmns> whats the regex?
[12:52:02] <Eviltwin> a^nb^n is a non-regular language
[12:52:04] * destryalhmns braces for impact
[12:52:39] <Eviltwin> Well-nested parantheses intersected with (*)* produces (^n)^n
[12:52:54] <Eviltwin> Which is of the form a^nb^n
[12:53:05] <Eviltwin> So well-nested parantheses are not a regular language
[12:54:43] <MrTrick> destryalhmns: the regex is inputted by the user.
[13:23:42] <hypnoseal> So I decided to use a while loop.  I set a getTime() each time the function did something, and put a while loop that when right now subtract the timer time was less than a certain amount it returned false.  Do you think that is a reasonable solution?
[13:23:51] <hypnoseal> It work's so I'm guessing it's fine
[13:26:03] <hypnoseal> example I used: http://pastebin.com/cDT2dSSi
[13:28:46] <zlib> greetings, anybody know of a jquery equivalent to http://wall.plasm.it?
[13:41:05] <pom> I have an element with a class "selected". If I click one of it's siblings I want to add "selected" class to all sibling from the one already "selected" until the one I clicked. Any ideas?
[13:47:20] <Skinkie> hi, I am doing requests with ajax() and they are to a foreign host, that has all the CORS headers etc.
[13:47:39] <Skinkie> is there a way how these request could download in one go,  instead of queuing after eachother?
[13:49:19] <destryalhmns> wouldnt that be server side?
[13:49:35] <Skinkie> i have tried to disable keep-alive
[13:49:47] <Skinkie> but this is only known to the browser after the request
[13:49:58] <Skinkie> obviously i could do some voodoo with multiple subdomains
[13:50:05] <Skinkie> but that is a stupid workaround
[13:50:23] <destryalhmns> i dont understand the problem
[13:50:36] <destryalhmns> yesterday i had too much trouble centering a div
[13:50:36] <Skinkie> at time X i need to download 4 resources
[13:50:48] <destryalhmns> ....you are getting content from multiple sources?
[13:50:51] <Skinkie> each of those resources take processing time
[13:50:57] <Skinkie> one single domain
[13:51:42] <Skinkie> some processing takes longer than other, because some of it could be cached
[13:51:44] <Skinkie> some of it not
[13:51:59] <Skinkie> so in general it is in the form: cache.mydomain.com/number
[13:52:08] <Skinkie> now i want to download /1 /2 /3 at the same time
[13:52:35] <destryalhmns> k so whats the problem async is default
[13:52:48] <Skinkie> it doesn't apply for cors hosts it seems
[13:53:03] <destryalhmns> cors hosts?
[13:53:08] <Skinkie>  Cross-domain requests and dataType: "jsonp" requests do not support synchronous operation.
[13:53:19] <Skinkie> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:53:35] <destryalhmns> this is a known issue
[13:53:46] <destryalhmns> you cant do cross domain with iframe or object
[13:54:01] <destryalhmns> only hope atm is to use the server as a proxy
[13:54:04] <Skinkie> thats why they invented CORS...
[13:54:08] <Skinkie> to allow this
[13:54:19] <Skinkie> but it doesn't make sense why async wouldn't work
[13:54:29] <Skinkie> http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/
[13:54:40] <destryalhmns> where does async go?
[13:54:54] <destryalhmns> it should only be concerned about the server
[14:06:59] <destryalhmns> am i wrong? if you are downloading from multiple sources just wait until what you have is doen downloading and then show it
[14:07:13] <destryalhmns> use the server to synchronize it
[14:07:21] <destryalhmns> at worst use settimout
[14:07:34] <snover> ?async @ Skinkie
[14:07:34] <bot-t> Skinkie, NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the user’s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[14:07:51] <Skinkie> snover: i am not setting async to false
[14:07:56] <Skinkie> did you follow what i wrote?
[14:08:14] <destryalhmns> you can set it to false if the execution scope does not effect the rest of the page
[14:08:19] <simpleton> how can I change the font color of all ampersands in a div to red without changing all of the text's font color to red? I tried $('#thumbs').text().replace(/&/g, '&').css('color', 'red'); but it doesn't work
[14:09:15] <destryalhmns> skinkie i followed what you wrote
[14:09:35] <red_square> simpleton you will need to wrap them in a span
[14:09:50] <simpleton> red_square I can't, they're generated code :(
[14:09:53] <destryalhmns> but warning i am WASTED (unfortuntely/as usual) but the problem doesnt seem that hard
[14:12:23] <snover> Skinkie: Well, there’s nothing CORS does differently from a normal XHR in that regard
[14:13:32] <destryalhmns> complete : function() { setTimeout(function(){if(otherFunctionsDone)dosomething();}, 100){}}
[14:13:45] <Skinkie> snover: so you are saying it isn't blocked by the browser at all?
[14:13:45] <destryalhmns> or something basically like that in an apocalypse scenario
[14:17:51] <snover> Skinkie: The only thing CORS will do differently is if you are making a request that might cause side-effects on the server, it will make a preflight OPTIONS request to the server prior to the actual request
[14:17:58] <snover> it is fully non-blocking.
[14:18:43] <Skinkie> snover: why is it then so explicitly marked in the documentation the request itself isn't async?
[14:19:48] <snover> Skinkie: which documentation, specifically, are you referring to?
[14:20:23] <Skinkie> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:20:32] <Skinkie> By default, all requests are sent asynchronously (i.e. this is set to true by default). If you need synchronous requests, set this option to false. Cross-domain requests and dataType: "jsonp" requests do not support synchronous operation.
[14:20:47] <snover> Skinkie: do not support *synchronous* operation.
[14:20:50] <snover> not asynchronous.
[14:20:51] <snover> synchronous.
[14:21:03] <Skinkie> oops
[14:21:15] <Skinkie> i stand corrected
[14:21:46] <snover> hence my “do not set async false” comment because your comments implied you wanted to make synchronous requests
[14:23:08] <Amanda19> is it possible to do an online calculator
[14:23:15] <Amanda19> how hard is it?
[14:23:31] <Amanda19> i would need a calculator that shows vibrations of names
[14:23:35] <imsky> it's pretty hard
[14:23:37] <destryalhmns> pseudo async can be done using settimeout
[14:23:39] <red_square> depends what your used to Amanda19
[14:23:40] <Skinkie> snover: no actually i want to make them paralel, but for some reason it seems that they are 'waiting' until they finish eachother
[14:23:44] <Amanda19> each letter has a vibration from 1-9
[14:23:54] <Amanda19> for example reno vibration is 19
[14:24:06] <Amanda19> maria is 9
[14:24:15] <Amanda19> so how hard is it to do this online
[14:24:19] <FFForever> What is the best way to load content from another div while still allowing for proper SEO?
[14:24:22] <snover> Skinkie: what is the destination? php script?
[14:24:36] <destryalhmns> SEO?
[14:24:41] <Amanda19> for example a i j q y have vibration 1, b k r have 2.......
[14:24:52] <Amanda19> the program just calculates the sum of tatal vibrations
[14:24:54] <snover> FFForever: google has guidelines for that.
[14:25:03] <destryalhmns> whats seo
[14:25:10] <Skinkie> actually not, it is the output of some 'challange-response' server, so infact a proxy that makes a another asynchronous request synchrone for http
[14:25:16] <snover> ?lmgtfy seo @ destryalhmns
[14:25:17] <bot-t> destryalhmns, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=seo
[14:25:54] <destryalhmns> lol thats a funny bot
[14:26:00] <snover> Skinkie: I don’t know what to tell you, nothing will block on the client-side except that if you are making a request w/ side-effects it will not be made until the OPTIONS request is finished
[14:26:15] <destryalhmns> it means Search Engine Optimization, duh
[14:26:16] <Skinkie> snover: https://github.com/StichtingOpenGeo/reisinfokaart/blob/master/htdocs/scripts/openstreetmap.js#L138
[14:26:37] <snover> destryalhmns: u trollin bro?
[14:27:18] <snover> god reading application code that uses jquery makes me so sad
[14:27:41] <snover> Skinkie: I don’t know what this is supposed to be telling me exactly
[14:27:43] <destryalhmns> snover,  ready for a challenge
[14:27:51] <Tobbi> Is anyone familiar with jQuery UI? How comes my custom select handler is not being called?
[14:28:05] <Skinkie> snover: each ajax request i hope to run in paralel
[14:28:22] <snover> those calls are not going to block, they do not look like they will even cause a preflight request
[14:28:49] <snover> but of course there is a limit on the number of parallel requests that can be occurring at any one time at the browser level
[14:30:02] <destryalhmns> each all +1, on each successfull callbaback +1?
[14:30:23] <destryalhmns> if you insist they be processed as a group
[14:34:10] <FFForever> Is it possible to check if an image has loaded yet?
[14:46:52] <ldiamond> coming from mootools, what's the equivalent for classes, interfaces and extending another class?
[14:50:42] <Guest40708> how can i make a function run once per second
[14:51:18] <bbrandon> setInterval
[14:51:36] <bbrandon> @Guest40708
[14:51:50] <Guest40708> okay
[14:51:54] <Guest40708> and then recall itself
[14:52:00] <bbrandon> yeh!
[14:52:21] <Guest40708> i haven't written any javascript in a minute and i've been writing a lot of php
[14:52:24] <Guest40708> having brain farts
[15:03:01] <hypnoseal> I'm trying to use setInterval to perform a function I wrote, so that the function is called every 5 seconds.  Along with this I have tried to use .addClass and .removeClass to the button which manually performs the function (to show the user what's happening).  The weird thing is that during the first interval it works perfectly, but on the following intervals .removeClass does not seem to
[15:03:01] <hypnoseal> work.  I have no errors in firebug, so I'm kind of at a loss.  Here is the code: http://pastebin.com/Uf2mwdNd
[15:04:05] <Eviltwin> Um....
[15:04:15] <Eviltwin> while ((new Date().getTime() - timer) < 5000) { return false; }
[15:04:15] <Eviltwin> WTF?
[15:04:56] <Eviltwin> What are you trying to accomplish there?
[15:04:57] <hypnoseal> It's what I'm using to not allow these functions to happen over a certain period of time.
[15:05:09] <hypnoseal> Works fine for the other functions...
[15:05:28] <Eviltwin> Why is it a while statement?
[15:05:43] <Eviltwin> What's the goal?
[15:06:24] <Eviltwin> If (new Date().getTime() - timer) is less than 5000, what do you want to happen?
[15:06:30] <hypnoseal> http://www.phpied.com/sleep-in-javascript/
[15:06:33] <hypnoseal> The comment by Stuart
[15:06:51] <Eviltwin> Never, ever, ever, ever do this ever
[15:07:09] <hypnoseal> Bummer
[15:07:12] <Eviltwin> JavaScript doesn't have sleep for a damn good reason
[15:07:34] <Guest40708> what if my document is never ready because its running an endless php loop?
[15:08:23] <Eviltwin> Guest40708: Then you shouldn't wait for doc ready
[15:09:03] <Guest40708> right, what can i do instead?  is it safe to just call a function without check if its ready?
[15:09:29] <Guest40708> checking*
[15:09:52] <Eviltwin> Depends on the function and when it's called
[15:09:53] <Guest40708> Eviltwin:
[15:10:57] <Guest40708> Eviltwin: i tried $('#container').ready(function() { but that didnt work
[15:12:13] <Eviltwin> Of course it didn't work
[15:12:21] <Eviltwin> Only the document has a ready event
[15:13:03] <Eviltwin> If you embed the script after the section that container, it should be "ready" and thus selectable
[15:15:46] <Guest40708> grr
[15:16:23] <Guest40708> it works in js fiddle
[15:16:31] <Eviltwin> What does?
[15:17:05] <Guest40708> http://jsfiddle.net/sCDmQ/
[15:17:41] <Guest40708> thats too simple perhaps
[15:17:57] <Eviltwin> Guest40708: http://jsfiddle.net/sCDmQ/1/
[15:17:58] <Guest40708> and doesn't include my php loop
[15:18:31] <Guest40708> okay
[15:18:34] <Eviltwin> The forever PHP loop is usually considered a bad practice for a page the user is seeing
[15:18:58] <Guest40708> it is necessary for the application
[15:19:03] <Eviltwin> Why?
[15:19:15] <Guest40708> cause its an irc bot written in php
[15:19:22] <Guest40708> and it needs to stay connected
[15:19:56] <Eviltwin> This sounds like a failure of epic proportions
[15:20:11] <Eviltwin> But even in that case
[15:20:24] <Guest40708> works fine echoing out stuff
[15:20:31] <Eviltwin> The better practice is to have the forever-running script be in a separate frame
[15:20:35] <ldiamond> How do you create a class/type and create objects of that class/type?
[15:20:39] <Guest40708> but i want to grab it and append it with jquery instead
[15:21:05] <Eviltwin> Is this going to be open in a browser?
[15:21:16] <Guest40708> yeah
[15:21:19] <Eviltwin> Why?
[15:21:30] <Eviltwin> I'm not understanding why an IRC bot is in a browser
[15:21:32] <Guest40708> cause the gui will be a webchat interface for controlling the bot
[15:21:46] <Guest40708> duh
[15:22:01] <Eviltwin> You should probably look at something like node.js instead
[15:22:10] <Guest40708> why?
[15:22:21] <Eviltwin> Because it's designed to support long-running processes server-side
[15:22:24] <Eviltwin> Persistant connections
[15:22:29] <Guest40708> i see
[15:22:37] <Eviltwin> PHP is designed to start when a request comes in
[15:22:40] <Eviltwin> Do it's work and then quit
[15:22:45] <dilvie> ldiamond: there are several ways to do that in JavaScript. Personally, I like to use prototypes, and then use extend (like $.extend()) to inherit it properties, or Object.create(), depending on exactly what behavior I want.
[15:22:48] <Eviltwin> node.js is designed as a daemon
[15:22:49] <Guest40708> i understand
[15:22:56] <Eviltwin> It starts up and then gets events for new connections
[15:22:57] <Guest40708> my php is solid that is not my issue
[15:23:04] <Eviltwin> And can handle however it wants
[15:23:09] <Eviltwin> But keeps running the whole time
[15:23:47] <Guest40708> so you think my ongoing loop should be its own process separate from the main gui page
[15:23:51] <dilvie> ldiamond: If I want to be able to extend the prototype at runtime and have everything inherit from that, I create the prototype with an empty constructor function .. var Proto = function Proto() {};
[15:23:52] <Eviltwin> Absolutely
[15:24:12] <Guest40708> yeah i figured it would end up there
[15:24:12] <Eviltwin> And there's a pretty common practice for doing communication that way
[15:24:20] <Eviltwin> Where you just echo out a new <script></script> tag
[15:24:26] <Eviltwin> That calls a function that hits the parent frame with the new data
[15:24:29] <dilvie> Proto.prototype.newFunc = function newFunc() { /* everything gets this, even after instances are instantiated */ };
[15:24:34] <Guest40708> that seems cheap
[15:24:39] <Guest40708> echoing out script tags
[15:24:44] <Eviltwin> Instead of?
[15:25:15] <Guest40708> the script checking the status
[15:25:28] <Eviltwin> That's called polling
[15:25:36] <Eviltwin> Keep checking and checking over and over for chances
[15:25:37] <Eviltwin> changes*
[15:25:45] <ldiamond> dilvie, The javascript part is fine. I'm wondering what jQuery does to simplify it. In mootools for example you can do this: var myClass= new Class();
[15:25:46] <Eviltwin> And is considered a bad programming practice when it can be avoided
[15:25:49] <Guest40708> like having an ongoing js loop that is checking in on the php loop and spitting out whats going on
[15:25:54] <Eviltwin> And it can be avoided by spitting out the <script> tags
[15:26:02] <ldiamond> dilvie, then you define your constructor and object inside that function call.
[15:26:03] <Guest40708> i see
[15:26:11] <Guest40708> so the ongoing js loop is bad?
[15:26:27] <Eviltwin> Depends on how much work the ongoing loop is doing
[15:26:33] <Eviltwin> And how often it's doing it
[15:26:46] <dilvie> so inside your factory, you'd do var newInstance = $.extend(new Proto(), yourProps); // yourProps can be optional properties passed in as an object into the factory.
[15:26:51] <ldiamond> dilvie, I just wouldn't want to reinvent the wheel if something similar exists in jQuery. I've seen some plugins do that but it seems odd to have to use a plugin.
[15:26:57] <Eviltwin> With the echo'd <script> tags, your JavaScript will fire immediately, as soon as the new data is there
[15:27:16] <dilvie> ldiamond: I don't use constructors at all, except for the empty instructor inside the factory.
[15:27:17] <Eviltwin> Where as with the running loop, either you're going to check very frequently and waste a lot of CPU doing so
[15:27:17] <Guest40708> well its just append()ing a small string to a div every second
[15:27:28] <Eviltwin> Or check very infrequently and have lag as a result
[15:27:37] <Guest40708> yeah
[15:27:47] <Guest40708> ideally it would know when to check somehow
[15:27:51] <Eviltwin> Right
[15:27:57] <Eviltwin> And you do that with the <script> tags
[15:28:03] <Eviltwin> They trigger an update() function or something
[15:28:13] <Eviltwin> Or even call a function with the new data
[15:28:24] <Eviltwin> Like update({"msg": "Foo bar"});
[15:28:25] <dilvie> ldiamond: I only use new to create the new prototype from the empty constructor function. =)
[15:28:34] <Eviltwin> And then JavaScript figures out what to do with it
[15:28:43] <Guest40708> i was originally writing it to echo the script tags
[15:28:50] <Eviltwin> Obviously how you do it is up to you but I'm just trying to pass on good practices
[15:28:52] <Guest40708> but that didn't seem right
[15:28:54] <dilvie> ldiamond: and I ONLY use that pattern if I want to make the objects extensible at runtime... useful for building something like jQuery that you can add plugins to.
[15:28:55] <Eviltwin> And unfortunately I have to leave
[15:28:57] <Eviltwin> BBL
[15:28:59] <Eviltwin> Best of luck
[15:29:30] <disappearedng> It appears to me that I am not really supposed to store values in javascript objects if I want to iterate this collection again
[15:29:37] <dilvie> ldiamond: if you don't need that, just create a prototype with an object literal inside your factory. myProto = { prop1: 'value', prop2: 'anotherValue };
[15:29:40] <Guest40708> thank you
[15:29:56] <dilvie> then newInstance = $.extend(myProto, props);
[15:30:04] <dilvie> return newInstance;
[15:32:51] <ldiamond> dilvie, I guess I could stick to plain objects for now and when I need classes and instantiation I'll create a Class function that will create everything and return the constructor...
[15:36:22] <dilvie> ldiamond: If you use factories, you don't have to worry about "this" clobbering the global object when you forget "new", and you don't have to call the factory with the new keyword.
[15:36:31] <dilvie> IMO, the new keyword is not a good feature of JavaScript
[15:37:01] <dilvie> or any language in general. It's common for Java guys to get into the habit of only using new inside object factories.
[15:38:29] <dilvie> in JavaScript, any function can return an object. If you just want to pass init vars into a function, and get an object back with those vars, and maybe some defaults and calculated values, you can just use a normal function and return an extended object liteal.
[15:38:31] <dilvie> literal.
[15:39:14] <dilvie> you can inherit from other objects by passing them into the same constructor as the parameters object. the new object will inherit all the public properties.
[15:40:09] <dilvie> $.extend({}, defaults, props); // {} tells it to create a new instance. defaults is an object literal with default properties. props are the new properties you pass into the factory.
[15:41:04] <dilvie> return the resulting object, and you've got all the advantages of a regular class in JavaScript, without the headaches that come with using new.. and you don't have to call the function with new to get a new instance. Forgetting new won't clobber the global namesace.
[15:41:07] <dilvie> namespace.
[15:44:41] <tomster2300> i have images wrapped in links that i have no control over their formatting.  is there a way to remove the links without removing the images?
[15:45:21] <dilvie> the only reason I can think of to ever use "new" is if you need something like jQuery that lets you extend all instances of objects at runtime... and then you only need to call an empty constructor function from inside your factory, and extend that. =)
[16:04:06] <versatiletech> ...
[16:20:50] <someprimetime> from a design standpoint, what would i have to do to create a jquery plugin for radio checkboxes with images?
[16:27:03] <Guest40708> 		while(!feof($server['SOCKET'])) {//while we are connected to the server
[16:27:15] <Guest40708> oh
[16:27:17] <Guest40708> whoops
[16:28:07] <eXodus> Hello
[16:30:49] <ldiamond> dilvie, Well, the new keyword or the factory is all the same, just a different syntax. I think using the new keyword is a neater syntax.
[16:32:31] <Guest10621> http://jsfiddle.net/SK5TE/ - Whenever I try to take the value of each item's rel, the rel does not change after the first was clicked, check the fiddle.
[16:34:12] <someprimetime> Guest10621: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/SK5TE/1/
[16:34:14] <someprimetime> that what you want?
[16:34:53] <Guest10621> Yeah.. what was changed, looking..
[16:35:13] <someprimetime> you need to reference $(this) inside your click function
[16:35:22] <someprimetime> $(this) refers to what was just clicked
[16:35:25] <Guest10621> Ah yes, thank you ver much.
[16:35:32] <someprimetime> sure.
[16:35:39] <Guest10621> :)
[16:36:07] <tw2113> how would i create an associative array with $.each()? I'm trying to pull a name, latitude, and longitude data, for later use, from a foursquare api call
[16:36:59] <tw2113> i have an array var declared right before, but i am not quite sure how to go from there
[16:37:18] <someprimetime> tw2113: couldn't you just push() each item to an array and then combine those into a json object?
[16:37:37] <someprimetime> @tw2113 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/920930/how-to-create-json-by-javascript-for-loop
[16:37:55] <tw2113> will look at, thanks
[16:44:13] <dilvie> tw2113: there's no such thing as an associative array in JavaScript. Associative arrays are really just objects. var myCollection = {}; then, inside the .each(response, function (key, value) { myCollection[key] = value; });
[16:44:16] <Gorkyman_> hey guys... can I do something like .animate on json object?
[16:47:29] <dilvie> For the low down on how JavaScript arrays and objects work (and the differences / similarities between them) do check out the latest edition of JavaScript: The Definitive Guide -- probably the best book on JavaScript after The Good Parts.
[16:49:00] <kinesis> how do i make click to expand divs.. Like twitter, when you click Login it pops down the login box
[16:49:49] <kinesis> jQueryUI?
[16:50:17] <dilvie> tw2113: If you're grabbing all the public properties from one object and adding them to another object, you could just use extend.. and you can skip the pre-declaration bit as well: var myCollection = $.extend({}, response);
[16:50:20] <fris> modal?
[16:50:40] <dilvie> tw2113: that will do the same thing as the code I gave you the first time around. =)
[16:51:35] <fris> http://aext.net/example/twitterlogin/ kinesis ?
[16:51:52] <kinesis> im wondering if i should use jquerui though
[16:52:30] <kinesis> I might just build this domain into somehting Y Combinator-worthy then have it refined..
[16:52:53] <dilvie> jQuery UI is like training wheels... handy until you learn how to create your own UI stuff, but rather limiting one you get the hang of it.
[16:53:33] <dilvie> it's good for protoyping stuff very quickly, though
[16:53:47] <dilvie> styles and al
[16:53:49] <dilvie> all
[16:54:59] <kinesis> cool
[16:57:13] <someprimetime> something ycombinator worthy?
[16:57:16] <someprimetime> bahaha
[16:57:35] <someprimetime> like a ycombinator funded website validates anything
[16:57:51] <bradmaxs> trying to implement the jquery.ui.stars widget and am almost there. I need to send more than just the rating to the database but only the rating is being saved. http://jsfiddle.net/kYkaK/1/ thanks!
[16:58:55] <dilvie> someprimetime: There's nothing wrong with prototyping something to prime the pump for some VC love.
[16:59:04] <someprimetime> dilvie: there is everything wrong with it
[16:59:12] <someprimetime> and what is "yc worthy" anyway?
[16:59:30] <someprimetime> ycombinator is nothing more than an exploitation incubator
[16:59:42] <someprimetime> the only good thing is the exposure you get from it
[16:59:44] <dilvie> someprimetime: VC can be very useful. Nothing is as awesome at killing projects like a lack of resources. =)
[16:59:53] <someprimetime> dilvie: no kidding they're useful
[16:59:55] <someprimetime> yc is not.
[17:00:19] <someprimetime> the amount of money they provide is certainly not enough for the amount of stake they take in your company
[17:00:36] <someprimetime> not to mention if you need a vc to get your idea off the ground, you probably aren't motivated enough in the first place
[17:00:51] <someprimetime> i'd much rather do everything my own
[17:00:55] <someprimetime> outsource myself
[17:01:08] <someprimetime> not myself, but outsource everything myself
[17:01:26] <someprimetime> that way i own 100% of the company and don't have to report to any board or other investor
[17:02:50] <kwinsee> is there a way to clone the dom without doubling the memory? something like weak references?
[17:04:47] <dilvie> someprimetime: I'd ask Scribd, reddit, Airbnb, Dropbox, Disqus, and Posterous what they think about ycombinator.
[17:05:40] <dilvie> They're all ycombinator alumni
[17:06:25] <someprimetime> lol
[17:06:33] <someprimetime> that doesn't mean a thing. they all got lucky
[17:06:44] <someprimetime> all of those are also easily duplicated
[17:06:46] <someprimetime> come on, reddit?
[17:06:55] <dilvie> reddit's doing pretty well
[17:07:03] <someprimetime> i made a reddit clone in a couple days with cakephp
[17:07:10] <someprimetime> the only reason they got funding was for more exposure
[17:07:12] <dilvie> considering that similar sites have mostly taken nose dives lately.
[17:07:37] <dilvie> someprimetime: there's a big difference between building software that works for a few people and building a business around it.
[17:07:49] <someprimetime> dilvie: please explain it to me
[17:07:56] <someprimetime> cause i'm not quite sure what point you're trying to make.
[17:09:14] <imsky> lol this guy trollin'
[17:09:24] <dilvie> someprimetime: my point is that ycombinator gets a lot of hype because they were in on the ground floor of a lot of successful business launches.
[17:10:17] <someprimetime> dilvie: that makes no sense. there are tons of other successful vc firms that don't get hype, but were early investors in startups.
[17:10:48] <bradmaxs> can someone tell me why only one fields data is being saved to multiple fields via $post() - http://jsfiddle.net/kYkaK/2/

[17:18:15] <someprimetime> bradmaxs: try renaming the variable "value" for model and foreign_key?
[17:18:49] <bradmaxs> someprimetime: you mean to something else other than value?
[17:19:00] <someprimetime> well what is value set as/
[17:19:02] <someprimetime> ?*
[17:20:37] <bradmaxs> someprimetime: the form has 3 other fields (user_id, model and foreign_key) but the rating field is filling them all.  I think I am doing the $post() wrong. Sorry I am a noob when it comes to this:)
[17:22:16] <someprimetime> you can get rid of the comma after foreign_key: value
[17:22:24] <someprimetime> but not sure if that's gonna help you out
[17:22:38] <bradmaxs> I'll give it a try!
[17:23:06] <someprimetime> what plugin is this?
[17:23:45] <bradmaxs> someprimetime: nope - for some reason they are all getting a 3 or 4 or whatever star I select.  http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Star_Rating_widget
[17:24:02] <bradmaxs> ugh!
[17:26:51] <bradmaxs> back to the drawing board.  Thank you for your help someprimetime.

[17:40:47] <eXodusz> http://jsfiddle.net/SK5TE/4/ Every time a link is clicked the submit doubles (after the first click) can PM a live example on my domain ..
[17:40:52] <oojacoboo> hey guys, if I want to get the type from the result of a post, how can I do this?
[17:40:56] <systemfault> DofLeFou: Seems fine to me.
[17:41:00] <tome> Hi, I just ran into some odd behavior: if a response to a $.post is actually json, but the server does not set the correct content type, then the success handler of the $.post is not called. Of course that's a code mistake, but it seems a bit odd that the handler would not be called at all. Is that expected? For example the code here: http://pastie.org/3234306 does not have success called when the server doesn't explici
[17:41:00] <tome> tly set the content type.
[17:41:21] <oojacoboo> like… if(result.type() == "number")
[17:41:27] <DofLeFou> systemfault: if my <style>…</style> is not all in one line
[17:41:45] <DofLeFou> all have some social character …. my append goes ysod
[17:41:51] <systemfault> DofLeFou: Then split it on a few lines.?
[17:42:13] <DofLeFou> I meant … It has to be all in one line

[17:48:52] <theBrettman> what does dialog do that menu don't? I want to use menu to create a context menu...
[17:48:56] <dilvie> kwinsee: the data bind plugin from Microsoft does that... I just bind all the stuff to the same model, and update the HTML when the model changes. If an element on the page changes, you can trigger a model change, and then let the model update the display.
[17:49:11] <tome> oojacoboo: can you google for ways to check if a javascript variable is a number, that should do the trick?
[17:49:38] <oojacoboo> tome: save the smart ass
[17:49:40] <oojacoboo> I did that first
[17:49:42] <oojacoboo> thanks though
[17:49:54] <tome> oojacoboo: and what's the problem with that then?
[17:50:04] <dilvie> kwinsee: there's a whole book on the topic. It's called "JavaScript Applications", published by O'Reilly -- by the guy who made Spine.js... covers how to do the stuff from scratch, and how to do it with Backbone.js
[17:50:05] <oojacoboo> obv I didn't find the answer
[17:50:17] <theBrettman> is the number coming back as a string and needs to be integer?
[17:50:26] <tome> oojacoboo: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1303646/check-variable-whether-is-number-or-string-in-javascript   check the isNumber solution there

[17:51:16] <dilvie> kwinsee: I'm writing another book that also covers that topic, called "Programming JavaScript Applications" (also on O'Reilly). Bet you didn't know you question was loaded enough for two books to answer it. ;)
[17:51:20] <Eviltwin> Ugh

[17:51:34] <tome> haha, nice : )

[17:52:40] <dilvie> theBrettman: No.    (... actually.. you're in jQuery. It's a fair bet there are a few in here.)

[17:53:26] <bot-t> fulcan, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[17:53:27] <oojacoboo> not UI
[17:53:42] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: ...
[17:53:45] <theBrettman> yeah, I'm talking about jquery ui
[17:53:47] <Eviltwin> This is the channel for jQuery and jQuery UI support
[17:53:59] <joshsmith> I have multiple ul's on a page with multiple li's; what's the fastest way to loop through all of the li's and match the text?
[17:54:01] <oojacoboo> yes, I know… but I thought it was a general UI question
[17:54:05] <theBrettman> how bout u, evil? u know?
[17:54:24] <Eviltwin> theBrettman: I use jQuery without jQuery UI or any other plugins
[17:54:28] <theBrettman> I think someone is working on context menu for 1.9 but idk
[17:54:41] <dilvie> kwinsee: The short answer is "no", because if it was in jQuery core, it would kindof dictate how we handle separation of concerns in jQuery apps, and jQuery is designed to be agnostic about that stuff... because there are several conflicting (and valid) methods.
[17:54:46] <fulcan> Eviltwin ?
[17:54:48] <theBrettman> I will have to scour github
[17:55:02] <Eviltwin> fulcan: Add an alert to the script and see if that alert comes up in the page that's not working
[17:55:22] <fulcan> Eviltwin alerts do work
[17:55:23] <Eviltwin> fulcan: Or learn how to debug properly and see ?ftj
[17:55:24] <bot-t> fulcan, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[17:55:42] <abstrusenick> any javascript library that abstract the differences between indexeddb and websql?
[17:56:15] <fulcan> Eviltwin is this http://fixingthesejquery.com  a joke?
[17:56:17] <dilvie> kwinsee: The long answer is you can wire up some MVC, RVP, MVP etc.. logic to handle it for you... or pull in something like Backbone.js to handle it for you. Backbone is a good minimalist approach if you just want to get it done quickly without dealing with the complexities of rolling your own MVC.
[17:56:21] <RingZer0> anyone know if there is a google apis freenode channel?
[17:56:43] <Eviltwin> fulcan: Absolutely not. It's written in sort of a fun manner but it's loaded with useful debugging information
[17:57:00] <joshsmith> I think something like $.each('ul.class li').each(function( $(this).text() ); would work fine

[18:02:20] <Booozoo> I can PM you a live example of what i'm having trouble with (the direct url to my domain)
[18:02:20] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ Booozoo
[18:02:21] <bot-t> Booozoo, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:02:26] <Eviltwin> working demo please
[18:02:41] <Eviltwin> First, only one element can have a given ID
[18:02:53] <Eviltwin> You have 5 elements here with the same ID
[18:02:54] <Eviltwin> That's not allowed
[18:02:55] <versatiletech> Eviltwin: beat me to it XD
[18:03:27] <Eviltwin> Booozoo: And did you actually try clicking these? http://jsfiddle.net/SK5TE/4/
[18:03:46] <danzik171> theBrettman: it's called an IIFE.  see http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[18:03:56] <theBrettman> thx danzik
[18:04:42] <Eviltwin> danzik171: It goes by many names
[18:05:15] <danzik171> and i could list them all, or just one commonly accepted one
[18:07:52] <versatiletech> kratsg: if I'm not mistaken if you use append, it doesn't return the new elements, it still returns whatever the element used in the original jquery object selector. So $('.parent').append('<span />').data('iwant') should work.
[18:08:21] <Eviltwin> Correct
[18:08:28] <versatiletech> or .attr('data-iwant')
[18:08:29] <Eviltwin> .append does not modify the collection
[18:08:33] <Eviltwin> Nor does .appendTo

[18:24:16] <coldhead> of course, no fear
[18:24:45] <FFForever> Is there any way to see if an input textbox has a value of the default value vs the current value?
[18:24:47] <coldhead> i know that deep down, if you ever had the chance, you would kill me
[18:24:50] <coldhead> and i appreciate that
[18:24:59] <versatiletech> XD
[18:25:18] <FFForever> I tried checking $(this).val() == $(this).attr('value'), but that is checking the live value

[18:41:16] <donCams> hello
[18:41:43] <donCams> when passing data with a json format to $.ajax(); what is the method employed by jquery on encoding that data?
[18:50:28] <Eviltwin> JSON.stringify
[18:51:25] <Eviltwin> Oh, wait
[18:51:30] <Eviltwin> You mean if your data isn't a string?
[18:51:32] <Eviltwin> It uses $.param
[18:55:30] <donCams> yes...
[18:56:12] <Eviltwin> For manipulating JSON, you want to use JSON.parse and JSON.stringify
[18:56:25] <Eviltwin> JSON is a text format
[18:56:33] <Eviltwin> So if you pass data in JSON format, you are passing a string
[18:56:39] <Eviltwin> Unicode characters
[18:56:55] <Eviltwin> In your situation you are passing an object or array
[18:57:06] <Eviltwin> That was why I was confused
[19:02:31] <donCams> ahhh
[19:02:37] <donCams> sorry, i don't understand
[19:04:12] <donCams> here's my problem, I have a web html editor
[19:04:52] <donCams> i'm passing the HTML codes via ajax... so var myHTML = $('#myHTML').val();
[19:05:31] <donCams> then $.ajax({data: {'html': myHTML ...
[19:05:55] <donCams> when I retrieve it in php, it's encoded
[19:06:06] <donCams> i need to decode it in php
[19:09:19] <radiantstatic> Does anyone have any idea what effect this site is using from the photo shuffling?
[19:09:21] <radiantstatic> http://safe.tumblr.com/theme/preview/31615
[19:10:29] <Eviltwin> radiantstatic: Someone linked this a few weeks ago
[19:10:34] <Eviltwin> It's done entirely with CSS3
[19:11:11] <radiantstatic> Eviltwin: Any jquery alternatives that could perhaps emulate the effects?
[19:11:35] <Eviltwin> Nothing as smooth
[19:13:16] <Eviltwin> radiantstatic: http://static.tumblr.com/szanjxb/7fJlpp71p/animation.css
[19:13:21] <Eviltwin> See the :hover selectors?
[19:13:27] <Eviltwin> That's how it's done
[19:13:50] <radiantstatic> Oh wow. Thanks for the info.
[19:14:41] <Eviltwin> So obviously it only works in modern browsers
[19:15:06] <Eviltwin> The real trick in making a jQuery alternative is the rotation
[19:15:31] <Eviltwin> There's no good non-CSS(3) technique for rotating things in older browsers
[19:16:34] <joshsmith> is there any way I can add a class to an item that's prepended immediately after it's prepended?
[19:16:42] <joshsmith> without keeping track of it in some other way?
[19:17:20] <Eviltwin> $("<div>").addClass("foo").prependTo("#container");
[19:17:22] <Eviltwin> Like that?
[19:17:29] <rbancroft> should the argument to $(document).ready() always be an inline function? I've tried passing in an existing function, but that doesn't always work for some reason
[19:17:37] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[19:17:49] <Eviltwin> $("<div>").prependTo("#container").addClass("foo");
[19:18:15] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: I'm gonna try that. one second
[19:19:10] <Eviltwin> What's this for?
[19:19:15] <Eviltwin> Why immediately after?
[19:19:55] <joshsmith> well, I've got an li within an a, I'm looping through those and pulling out the html from the li
[19:19:57] <joshsmith> and prepending that
[19:20:08] <joshsmith> back in front of all the other a > li's
[19:22:30] <joshsmith> actually there is a better way to do this, I think
[19:22:52] <joshsmith> if I have an li within an a
[19:23:08] <joshsmith> some of the li's have classes, like li.yours
[19:23:20] <Eviltwin> An LI within an S?
[19:23:21] <Eviltwin> A*
[19:23:25] <joshsmith> how can I get the last li with that?
[19:23:28] <joshsmith> yeah
[19:23:48] <joshsmith> I know that's kind of backwards
[19:24:19] <Eviltwin> Look at the :last pseudo-selector
[19:24:34] <oojacoboo> $("li:last a")
[19:24:43] <oojacoboo> and if you want the li there use parentNode
[19:24:59] <oojacoboo> that would ensure you got the last li if there is an a
[19:26:19] <joshsmith> oojacoboo: it's an a > li
[19:26:27] <joshsmith> and the li has the class
[19:26:35] <oojacoboo> umm
[19:26:36] <oojacoboo> no
[19:26:45] <oojacoboo> you don't put an li in an a
[19:26:59] <oojacoboo> that's just wrong wrong
[19:30:08] <joshsmith> the reason I was doing that is because I had no ability to get the outer html otherwise
[19:30:24] <oojacoboo> joshsmith: there is no valid reason for that at all
[19:30:29] <oojacoboo> seriously
[19:30:35] <oojacoboo> that's not valid markup
[19:32:21] <joshsmith> blah. I wish there were a way to get the outerHTML and not just innerHTML
[19:32:58] <oojacoboo> can't you just do $(this).html(); ?
[19:33:50] <joshsmith> no because I need the full html of the li itself
[19:34:17] <joshsmith> not just the inner HTML
[19:34:18] <oojacoboo> joshsmith: make a fiddle
[19:34:30] <spiffie> why? if you're trying to move it to the top of the list, you can just prepend $(this)
[19:35:07] <joshsmith> spiffie: really?
[19:35:52] <joshsmith> wow
[19:35:56] <joshsmith> I did not know that
[19:36:09] <joshsmith> that would've saved so much effort
[19:37:00] * spiffie is very familiar with that feeling
[19:38:27] <GeneralKim> question in regards to sortable - display as grid (http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#display-grid):
[19:38:27] <GeneralKim> if i drag 2 to 9 how can i impliment it such that only 2 and 9 exchange places, and all other elements stay the same?
[19:40:42] <rbancroft> any tips on jquery selectors not working in $(document).ready() in chrome?
[19:40:52] <joshsmith> spiffie: can I do the addClass on the prependTo?
[19:41:12] <joshsmith> ah I can
[19:41:12] <spiffie> something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/spiffie/ptgsZ/
[19:42:03] <spiffie> yeah, any chainable method will let you continue. just be careful you know what the selected set contains at any point in your chains.
[19:45:15] <Jonno_FTW> hello
[19:45:18] <Jonno_FTW> I have a question
[19:45:55] <Jonno_FTW> is there a jQuery plugin to achieve the same effect as the mootools fx.elements section on this page: http://www.designinfluences.com/fluid960gs/
[19:49:59] <Eviltwin> Not sure if they're all built-in and widget-wrapped plugins but I think all of these are relatively easy to achieve
[19:50:31] <Eviltwin> Have you looked at the demos for these? http://jqueryui.com/demos/
[19:50:59] <Eviltwin> Like this one: http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/#mouseover
[19:51:41] <Eviltwin> Oh, sorry, I misread
[19:51:58] <Eviltwin> You mean the one right below the heading "MooTools fx.elements"
[19:52:03] <Jonno_FTW> Eviltwin: yep
[19:52:19] <Eviltwin> I don't think it's hard to do
[19:52:37] <Jonno_FTW> would it just be like
[19:52:54] <Eviltwin> A mouseover for each and a mouseout for the container
[19:53:04] <Jonno_FTW> when you mouse over, $(this) has an animated width change, and all the others go back to normal?
[19:53:09] <Jonno_FTW> also
[19:53:20] <Jonno_FTW> IE9 says a page is running in compatibility mode
[19:53:30] <Jonno_FTW> but FF says standards compliance mode
[19:53:34] <Eviltwin> I don't know about you but I'd rather have them slide behind each other than resize
[19:54:25] <Jonno_FTW> ok
[19:54:35] <Eviltwin> These here resize
[19:54:39] <Jonno_FTW> or could I just import mootools as well
[19:54:47] <Eviltwin> Don't just import MooTools for one animation
[19:54:52] <Eviltwin> This is easy to code in jQuery
[19:54:56] <Jonno_FTW> ok
[19:55:33] <Eviltwin> The fourth one appears a lot wider to me
[19:56:12] <Eviltwin> But the text only spans part way if you put more in there
[19:57:00] <Eviltwin> Also: http://www.jeremymartin.name/projects.php?project=kwicks
[19:57:10] <Eviltwin> That's apparently what the effect is called
[19:57:58] <Jonno_FTW> cool, I think I'll go with that one, thanks for the help
[20:01:14] <Guest40708> why isn't this loop working? http://jsfiddle.net/AdN2m/
[20:01:35] <Eviltwin> Because of the difference between referring to a function and executing it
[20:02:05] <Eviltwin> alert(foo()); runs the foo function and alerts the returned result
[20:02:12] <Eviltwin> alert(foo); alerts whatever is stored in foo
[20:05:53] <bobbobbins> hey, im using: 	$("input:visible, select:visible, textarea:visible").removeAttr("disabled"); to try to enable some form fields, and it works, but input type="hidden" still stays disabled, anyone know how to fix that?
[20:06:31] <Eviltwin> That's because they're not visible, they're hidden
[20:06:39] <Eviltwin> :visible is the opposite of :hidden
[20:06:39] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/hidden-selector/
[20:08:13] <Guest40708> Eviltwin: i don't understand
[20:09:16] <bobbobbins> well yeah, i get that, but :visible i thought was more about the display, not the input type
[20:09:40] <Eviltwin> It's about the visibility of the elemnt
[20:09:42] <Eviltwin> element*
[20:09:51] <saddishwasher> sup all
[20:09:53] <Eviltwin> And <input type="hidden"> is NOT visible
[20:10:05] <kborchers> sadistwasher!
[20:10:09] <saddishwasher> :)
[20:10:12] <bobbobbins> so how can i turn disabled off...i want it hidden, but not disabled
[20:10:18] <saddishwasher> kboardshorts
[20:10:22] <kborchers> :P
[20:10:26] <Eviltwin> Guest40708: http://jszen.blogspot.com/2008/07/function-reference-vs-function-call.html
[20:10:33] <kborchers> that never gets old
[20:10:37] <saddishwasher> nope
[20:10:56] <Eviltwin> bobbobbins: Select it and remove the disabled property...
[20:11:17] <saddishwasher> evening Eviltwin
[20:11:18] <Guest40708> so you're saying i should setInterval(loop, 1000); instead of loop()
[20:11:28] <Eviltwin> Guest40708: Yes
[20:11:35] <Eviltwin> saddishwasher: Evening
[20:11:55] <Guest40708> thanks Eviltwin you get two shiny green star stickers
[20:11:59] <bobbobbins> Eviltwin, but i don't know the id at that moment, thats why im doing it this way
[20:12:15] <Eviltwin> As I hope you know by now, you can select by more than just ID
[20:12:51] <bobbobbins> hmmm, yeah, i know that, i guess im just not sure what to select
[20:13:06] <Guest40708> bobbobbins: what do you want to select?
[20:13:12] <Eviltwin> Maybe inputs that have type hidden? Maybe...
[20:13:30] <bobbobbins> EvilTwin: yeah, but there are more than one, and i only want to turn on a certain on
[20:13:43] <bobbobbins> Guest46680, im selecting a hidden input
[20:13:58] <dualcore> you can loop over the hidden items
[20:14:08] <bobbobbins> one thats in the visible div...so i guess i need to just work from that visible div to get the hidden elements in it
[20:14:18] <dualcore> and reference it by which number it is
[20:16:23] <dualcore> bobbobbins: do you have an example?
[20:16:51] <bobbobbins> i don't have the number, thats the problem, i think i might have solved it, im trying now...
[20:17:12] <dualcore> ok
[20:18:18] <bobbobbins> yup, got it...once i get the div that is visible i just do $(this).find("input[type=hidden]")
[20:22:57] <tash> anyone had problems with jqui modal form in FF or Chrome?
[20:23:01] <saddishwasher> that brings up a good point. has anyone jpref'ed $(this).find('#somediv"); vs $("#somediv", this)… ?
[20:23:08] <tash> It works fine for me in IE, but not in FF or Chrome
[20:24:03] <saddishwasher> I'm just wondering which is faster…if there is a difference
[20:25:27] <felipe_Brz> i remember seeing somewhere that there was a way to use jquery to include files
[20:25:34] <felipe_Brz> just can't find it anywhere anymore
[20:25:36] <LocalPCGuy> @saddiswasher the second is translated to the first in the code
[20:25:41] <felipe_Brz> can anybody tell me what it is?
[20:25:41] <dualcore> include in what way?
[20:25:57] <felipe_Brz> include a js file with function definitions, for example
[20:26:51] <LocalPCGuy> @saddiswasher http://paulirish.com/2009/perf/
[20:26:57] <dualcore> felipe_Brz: i know what you're talking about but i can't remember exactly.  why not just <script src=" like usual?
[20:27:06] <LocalPCGuy> @saddiswasher slide 18
[20:28:16] <felipe_Brz>  yeah sure I can do that but there was a cleaner way.. something like $.include('../anotherJSFile.js');
[20:28:25] <felipe_Brz> but I can't remember what it was
[20:28:30] <LocalPCGuy> @saddishwasher oops, mispelled your name, see above
[20:28:41] <felipe_Brz> I think I saw it on stackoverflow but I can't find it
[20:28:54] <saddishwasher> LocalPCGuy, cool, still want to do a perf just to see :)
[20:28:54] <LocalPCGuy> @felipe_Brz look up yepnope.js
[20:29:20] <felipe_Brz> LocalPCGuy: but it was no plugin
[20:29:37] <LocalPCGuy> @felipe_Brz or modernizr.load (yepnode in modernizr)
[20:30:01] <dualcore> felipe_Brz: unless that is necessary i would think its 'cleaner' to just load the script in the initial html.  that would certainly be faster.  page load time is priority usually
[20:30:35] <LocalPCGuy> @felipe_Brz the only include I know of for jQuery is through a plugin of some sort (there is even a .include() plugin)
[20:31:09] <dualcore> LocalPCGuy: felipe_Brz is thinking of the way to do it with just javascript i believe
[20:32:28] <LocalPCGuy> it would be easy enough to create a script tag and add a src to it
[20:32:37] <LocalPCGuy> when appended to the doc it should load the file
[20:32:47] <wookiehangover> ?getScript
[20:32:47] <bot-t> jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[20:32:59] <wookiehangover> BOOM
[20:33:04] <LocalPCGuy> yup
[20:33:07] <LocalPCGuy> duh
[20:33:55] <saddishwasher> LocalPCGuy, http://jsperf.com/this-selector-vs-this-find
[20:34:20] <felipe_Brz> wookie yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[20:35:03] <felipe_Brz> LocalPCGuy:  dualcore  jQuery.getScript()
[20:35:03] <LocalPCGuy> @saddishwasher nice - and it has the benefit of readability
[20:35:17] <felipe_Brz> i knew there was something like that!!
[20:35:19] <dualcore> ty
[20:35:20] <saddishwasher> LocalPCGuy, always a good benefit
[20:36:13] <LocalPCGuy> @felipe_Brz yup, saw that, forgot about that (I believe its just a wrapper on the .ajax function)
[20:36:34] <felipe_Brz> this is beautiful
[20:36:34] <solidus-river> how do you do regex in dom filters
[20:36:44] <solidus-river> i want the first li in my ul that has an id similar to
[20:36:47] <solidus-river> comment_*
[20:37:13] <solidus-river> i could also i guess just hard code it as the second li in the list, but this seems lame
[20:37:17] <solidus-river> LAME
[20:37:26] <solidus-river> morning all :)
[20:37:53] <saddishwasher> solidus-river, no need for regex: $("ul li[*id='coment_']:first-child"); should work
[20:38:00] <dualcore> what is your timezone solidus-river
[20:38:43] <solidus-river> dualcore: i'm actually in PST but my sleep schedule is all fskd
[20:39:11] <saddishwasher> solidus-river, oops I mean [id*='']
[20:39:20] <dualcore> oic
[20:39:28] <solidus-river> saddishwasher: that would be sweet! i'll check it out
[20:39:50] <solidus-river> saddishwasher: isn't that a regex in a way though, if i'm reading it right the id* means the id = this and then 0 or more other characters afterwords
[20:40:57] <saddishwasher> solidus-river, I wouldn't call it regex, although some might - kborchers & Eviltwin, care to chime in?
[20:41:26] <saddishwasher> solidus-river, and I'm sorry again but I think I got that wildcard mask wrong again, look here: http://www.emadibrahim.com/2009/07/25/jquery-wildcard-selector/
[20:41:45] <saddishwasher> I've used the * before but it seems others use ^
[20:42:44] <solidus-river> saddishwasher: very cool!, * would make more sense to me but maybe they didnt use that incase it would confuse people with multiplying an id by a string :? lol
[20:43:10] <joshsmith> http://jsfiddle.net/JTsdA/
[20:43:27] <joshsmith> how can I get the else { portion to do the addClass correctly?
[20:43:44] <dualcore> Snakes: !
[20:44:01] <tigrang> where can i find a list of core easing functions to use with animate()?
[20:44:26] <tigrang> nvm
[20:44:37] <kborchers> ?selectors @ solidus-river
[20:44:37] <bot-t> solidus-river, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 13, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[20:44:49] <dualcore> tigrang: jqueryui offers more
[20:46:09] <saddishwasher> kborchers, I was actually asking if wildcards in selectors are considered regex
[20:47:26] <joshsmith> anyone here know how to chain .after() and .addClass() correctly?
[20:48:22] <kborchers> saddishwasher: i would not call the selector regex, though i assume regex is eventually used in the selection. i would have to look at the source to know for sure
[20:48:44] <saddishwasher> gohead and get on that and let me know ;)
[20:49:08] <dualcore> ..
[20:49:20] <LocalPCGuy> @joshsmith after is a way to append an element to the page, you may want to look at next() or nextAll().eq(0)
[20:49:31] <saddishwasher> joshsmith, will this work? http://jsfiddle.net/JTsdA/1/
[20:49:44] <saddishwasher> LocalPCGuy, lol I just changed it to use .next()
[20:49:50] <joshsmith> ah yeah, next really is what I want
[20:50:01] <saddishwasher> LocalPCGuy, get out of my head!
[20:50:05] <joshsmith> wait
[20:50:07] <joshsmith> no it's not
[20:50:07] <LocalPCGuy> @joshsmith I don't like .next because it literally looks at the NEXT item (ONLY)
[20:50:28] <LocalPCGuy> @saddishwasher lol
[20:50:42] <LocalPCGuy> @joshsmith are you moving the li?
[20:50:58] <joshsmith> yeah
[20:50:59] <joshsmith> http://jsfiddle.net/XA3T8/
[20:51:03] <amh345> i'm trying to track where certain visits are coming from.  incoming links have something like domain.com?referred_from = site_xyz . but site_xyz will be different for every referrer.  is there a way to dynamically grab the site_xyz if referred_from is present in the URL?
[20:51:03] <joshsmith> that's a clearer example
[20:51:07] <saddishwasher> joshsmith, why not tell me if my fiddle is what you want and we can go from there
[20:51:24] <joshsmith> saddishwasher: nope, I need to move the li
[20:51:55] <joshsmith> basically, I'm taking all of these elements from a given array and putting them in alphabetical order at the front of the ul
[20:52:05] <gjanio> is there a way to create a duplicate a node so that the new one mimics the original?
[20:52:17] <joshsmith> gjanio: clone?
[20:52:31] <saddishwasher> joshsmith, ok, then what?
[20:52:54] <gjanio> sorry i should explain better
[20:53:11] <joshsmith> and then I need all of those prepended lis to have the class yours added to them
[20:53:18] <gjanio> i want to duplicate my whole page, shrink it, and move it to the corner and have it reflect changes in the real dom
[20:53:37] <saddishwasher> joshsmith, so all should be blue in the end?
[20:53:47] <joshsmith> saddishwasher: no, only the ones that match the array
[20:53:57] <gjanio> any way to do something like that?
[20:53:58] <joshsmith> that's what the $.inArray() does
[20:53:58] <saddishwasher> gotcha
[20:54:23] <joshsmith> so you can see that it's moving First and Third above Second
[20:54:33] <joshsmith> and keeping the order in which they were in the original array
[20:54:42] <joshsmith> hence the usage of the li:eq()
[20:55:08] <joshsmith> so maybe I just need this?
[20:55:12] <joshsmith> http://jsfiddle.net/XA3T8/1/
[20:55:38] <joshsmith> yep.
[20:56:12] <saddishwasher> joshsmith, this seems extremely conviluted for just adding a class to each element that matches a case in an each loop
[20:56:25] <joshsmith> it's not just adding a class
[20:56:35] <joshsmith> it's moving them to the top of the list
[20:57:55] <saddishwasher> hmm
[20:58:09] <LocalPCGuy> @joshsmith basically you are writing a sort function for dom elements?
[20:58:32] <joshsmith> LocalPCGuy: err, I guess?
[20:58:49] <LocalPCGuy> @joshsmith this might give some ideas: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/sorting-elements-with-jquery/
[20:58:51] <CodeZombie> hey guys, I've been looking at draggable in jquery ui, and I'm wondering if it's possible to force the draggable object to revert, only if the entire object is outside of the viewable area? http://jsfiddle.net/DotNetScott/dN2ZF/
[20:59:09] <Danielc1234> Our jquery has stopped working on our site, could someone take a peak and let me know if they see anything screwing with it? www.adirondack-chairs.cc   Thanks!
[20:59:11] <CodeZombie> http://jsfiddle.net/npErL/ is the fork I'm working with on jsfiddle
[21:00:13] <cornfeed> hello, how would one go about changing http://jsfiddle.net/UB9Ap/ to read "Scrollpane 5"
[21:01:31] <LocalPCGuy> @cornfeed $("th").text("Scrollpane 5");
[21:01:42] <saddishwasher> joshsmith, rather than worring about tagsTracker could you just use the index value from $.inArray() as the eq( val ) for li placement?
[21:01:57] <cornfeed> LocalPCGuy: of course
[21:01:58] <cornfeed> thx
[21:02:21] <joshsmith> the index value from the $.inaArray?
[21:02:27] <joshsmith> do you mean from the $.each()?
[21:02:45] <LocalPCGuy> @cornfeed be careful with that snippet for production code - it will replace ALL th's with that text :)
[21:02:52] <saddishwasher> joshsmith, no, use the index value from your items array when the item is found...
[21:03:22] <saddishwasher> joshsmith, in that case 'first' would be 0 and 'second' would be 1
[21:03:51] <joshsmith> how do I get the index of those items?
[21:04:31] <saddishwasher> well $.inArray() gives you the index by default… thats why !=== -1 works… because -1 is the index of a not found value
[21:05:26] <saddishwasher> joshsmith, so var indexVal = $.inArray(text, items); then if( indexVal !=== -1 ){ blah blah blah ….eq( indexVal )
[21:05:39] <joshsmith> saddishwasher: http://jsfiddle.net/XA3T8/3/
[21:06:05] <joshsmith> it'd have to be indexVal -1
[21:06:38] <saddishwasher> joshsmith, has to be -1 because list items start at -1?
[21:07:13] <joshsmith> no I'm saying it has to be eq(indexVal - 1)
[21:08:10] <saddishwasher> ok, well I guess I'm not too sure what your doing still.  But so far, the code looks shorter and works just the same :)
[21:09:17] <LocalPCGuy> @joshsmith so IF the item in the li matches an item in the array of items you want it to prepend to the ul
[21:09:21] <LocalPCGuy> ?
[21:09:30] <joshsmith> LocalPCGuy: yep
[21:09:51] <saddishwasher> LocalPCGuy, and add the class 'yours'
[21:10:11] <joshsmith> and I want any items after the first to be placed after the most recently added item
[21:10:41] <joshsmith> as you can see here http://jsfiddle.net/XA3T8/4/
[21:10:50] <joshsmith> the items are all in the same order as they were in the array
[21:11:10] <joshsmith> ergh, I just realized
[21:11:20] <saddishwasher> joshsmith, what if you just appended your li's that match to a buffer div, then prepend the whole thing, rather than needing to worry about indexes at all!
[21:11:23] <joshsmith> can't I just do array.reverse() and achieve the same effect?
[21:11:46] <saddishwasher> let me show you
[21:17:06] <LocalPCGuy> jsfiddle running slow?
[21:17:17] <joshsmith> yup
[21:18:20] <saddishwasher> oh jesus its slow
[21:19:07] <LocalPCGuy> @joshsmith got updated code for you if I can get jsfiddle to load - any other alternatives?
[21:19:26] <joshsmith> still waiting on my update to load, too
[21:19:32] <saddishwasher> lol me too
[21:19:48] <joshsmith> I wish I knew a fiddle alternative
[21:19:52] <joshsmith> it's been so slow lately
[21:20:54] <saddishwasher> joshsmith, check this out (conceptually, not functionally) http://pastebin.com/PjDcrqfm
[21:21:08] <LocalPCGuy> @joshsmith http://jsbin.com/ajiret/edit#javascript,html,live
[21:21:18] <LocalPCGuy> @joshsmith jsbin.com
[21:22:32] <joshsmith> hmm saddishwasher but what if I have multiple uls?
[21:22:38] <joshsmith> then I'd need to clear out that buffer div
[21:23:08] <saddishwasher> ok hold on
[21:23:17] <joshsmith> LocalPCGuy: that seems to *almost* work
[21:23:24] <joshsmith> doesn't go before the first li though
[21:23:43] <LocalPCGuy> @joshsmith yah, close - http://jsbin.com/ajiret/4/
[21:24:36] <joshsmith> also doesn't keep them in order
[21:24:43] <saddishwasher> joshsmith, http://pastebin.com/NVpfDrE3
[21:25:06] <joshsmith> ahh two each's
[21:25:14] <joshsmith> that looks like it'll probably do the trick
[21:25:45] <joshsmith> I could also not hard-code the buffer div and do that in JS too
[21:25:46] <saddishwasher> joshsmith, just depends on what you would rather do, manage the indeces or use two eaches
[21:25:58] <saddishwasher> joshsmith, indeed
[21:26:18] <saddishwasher> joshsmith, at the very least it gives you another idea, or another way to accomplish your goal
[21:26:20] <joshsmith> they're about the same overhead, I'd imagine (or trivially so), but your method is easier to read
[21:26:57] <saddishwasher> joshsmith, thats what I was thinking :)
[21:27:09] <saddishwasher> lol, but I might be alittle biased towards it
[21:27:14] <joshsmith> saddishwasher: there we go: http://jsfiddle.net/XA3T8/10/

[21:28:05] <ximarin> hi all I have a problem: one of my option-fields contains a value like 17". <option value="17\"">17"</option> how do I get the .val()-function to read the value as 17\" and not just 17\ ?
[21:28:49] <saddishwasher> joshsmith, watch out with display:none because you won't be able to get the content out of it with .html if it is set to display:none
[21:29:12] <joshsmith> ahh
[21:29:29] <saddishwasher> personally I wouldn't even worry about display:none or visibility:hidden since it will be placed in it and taken out of the buffer so fast you won't even see it
[21:29:47] <saddishwasher> well…you may see a flicker…which is not ideal
[21:29:58] <ajpiano> saddishwasher: wat
[21:30:08] <saddishwasher> ajpiano, what what?
[21:30:11] <ajpiano> "you won't be able to get the content out of it with .html if it is set to display:none" is not a factual statement
[21:30:29] <saddishwasher> ajpiano, oh, sorry, I thought it was…let me try real quick
[21:31:14] <ajpiano> no prob bob
[21:31:41] <saddishwasher> ajpiano, your right, ^^dedacted

[21:32:51] <joshsmith> saddishwasher: you were missing something else there, too

[21:33:07] <joshsmith> which would prepend to every ul
[21:33:25] <joshsmith> gotta cache a reference to this ul and prepend only to that one
[21:33:38] <LocalPCGuy> @joshsmith actually this one: http://jsbin.com/ajiret/6/edit
[21:33:46] <saddishwasher> joshsmith, lol true, change $('ul').prepend to $(this).prepend
[21:33:58] <LocalPCGuy> @joshsmith and it does, it just uses the UL in memory to hold the lis temporarily
[21:34:10] <joshsmith> nice LocalPCGuy !

[21:56:31] <cyberrog> But the code doesnt call the alert(data) inside thhe function..
[21:57:28] <tw2113> dunno, and i can't try myself since it's a localhost thing
[21:57:47] <tw2113> perhaps console.log() ?
[21:58:49] <cyberrog> tw2113, where the console.log is printed
[21:59:14] <tw2113> this is, assuming at least, that you have firebug/console available
[21:59:20] <tw2113> er inspect element
[21:59:54] <cyberrog> tw2113, it says is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[22:00:45] <tw2113> dunno then
[22:01:01] <tw2113> i'm mostly new with JS myself, but i know i was playing with $.getJSON earlier
[22:01:32] <cyberrog> ok
[22:01:47] <joshsmith> how can I get a class with another class (without using the chained syntax)
[22:02:24] <joshsmith> nevermind
[22:05:29] <rookie84> does anyone know how to reload a dynatree?
[22:08:03] <raj> is this valid? $(".autocomplete_div.active > .autocomplete")
[22:08:53] <bobbobbins> im using jquery ui's autocomplete...and im updating another textbox on change, and its working fine, but if you change something and hit submit immediately, the onchange doesn't register, anyone know how to fix that?
[22:10:14] <tw2113> how do you look up functions with the bot?
[22:10:47] <abjorn> ?each
[22:10:47] <bot-t> (5 hours 58 mins ago) <imsky> tell abjorn i made a portable node.js playa :V
[22:10:48] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[22:10:59] <joshsmith> has anyone used live with Bootstrap popovers?
[22:11:01] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky kul brah
[22:11:01] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[22:11:05] <joshsmith> they don't work at all for me
[22:18:07] <raj> is this valid? $(".autocomplete_div.active > .autocomplete")
[22:18:55] <Eviltwin> It is a valid CSS selector if that's what you're asking
[22:19:02] <Eviltwin> Whether or not it selects what you want it to is another question entirely
[22:19:14] <raj> if it's syntactically allowed
[22:19:20] <Eviltwin> Yup
[22:19:26] <raj> cool
[22:23:33] <siovene> Hi. I'm doing something like this: $('.comment .reply').click(function() { var $comment = $(this).parent('.comment'); }); - and I get that $comment is an element with selector = ".parent(.comment)".
[22:23:49] <siovene> How can I get the actual object instead?
[22:24:08] <Eviltwin> What?
[22:24:10] <siovene> (note: .reply is an anchor, and .comment is a div; I get that $comment is an anchor with that .parent(.comment) selector)
[22:24:23] <siovene> Yeah, I think I didn't explain very well :)
[22:24:47] <siovene> The structure is like this: <div class="comment"> <a class="reply"> </a> <form></form> </div>
[22:24:50] <Eviltwin> You want var $comment = $(this).closest('.comment');
[22:25:06] <siovene> Eviltwin: thanks. Why didn't my way work=?
[22:25:08] <Eviltwin> ?.closest @ siovene
[22:25:09] <bot-t> siovene, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[22:25:51] <Eviltwin> Well your way would work but only if the <a> was always an immediate child of the comment
[22:26:13] <siovene> Eviltwin: oh ok, thanks. I thought that parent() went up through the ancestors' tree.
[22:26:19] <siovene> .closet() works, thanks!
[22:26:22] <siovene> closest*
[22:26:28] <Eviltwin> Nope
[22:26:33] <Eviltwin> You're welcome.
[23:17:15] <joshsmith> how can I listen on anywhere on the body but a particular div?
[23:17:25] <joshsmith> listen for a click
[23:18:45] <dr0id> click event on body, return false in click event of div ? :P
[23:19:47] <joshsmith> no, I mean, let's say you have a popover
[23:20:01] <joshsmith> clicking anywhere outside of that popover should trigger a hide
[23:20:09] <joshsmith> clicking anywhere within it shouldn't
[23:20:25] <xec> what is a popover?
[23:20:39] <joshsmith> xec: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#popover
[23:20:39] <xec> like an overlay?
[23:20:53] <dr0id> the overlay is a div right ? onclicking that hide the popover
[23:20:55] <joshsmith> scroll down to the red demo button
[23:21:03] <dr0id> and they are already providing a JS file, so wutuneed?
[23:21:19] <xec> ah, so like a tooltip
[23:21:21] <joshsmith> dr0id: it's a popover; there's no overlay
[23:21:49] <xec> wouldn't is hide when you move the mouse? the demo seems to..
[23:21:50] <abstrusenick> can websql be used for storing json object?
[23:21:51] <joshsmith> xec: yep. it's actually built on their twipsy tooltips
[23:21:52] <dr0id> "joshsmith: clicking anywhere outside of that popover should trigger a hide"
[23:21:56] <dr0id> then why you say so ?
[23:22:09] <joshsmith> dr0id: you're clearly missing the point
[23:22:17] <dr0id> fine, am out then
[23:22:24] <joshsmith> xec: not if you do trigger: 'manual'
[23:22:45] <joshsmith> the default is on hover
[23:22:52] <joshsmith> so hover out, would ofc hide it
[23:23:30] <xec> joshsmith: is this all the documentation for popover?
[23:23:38] <joshsmith> yeah
[23:23:54] <joshsmith> I guess I could attach a click handler to the body that hides it
[23:23:56] <xec> seems very scarce
[23:24:11] <joshsmith> and then do another click handler on the popovers themselves that stops propagation
[23:24:22] <joshsmith> you don't know the half of it
[23:24:34] <joshsmith> I had to figure out how to reinitialize the popovers
[23:24:44] <joshsmith> which was buried deep inside some issue comment thread on github
[23:26:54] <Cork> abstrusenick: yes, json is just a text string
[23:27:27] <Cork> abstrusenick: you can't store javascript objects though, but thats another matter
[23:27:40] <abstrusenick> Cork: do you any library that abstract websql and indexeddb implementation?
[23:28:09] <abstrusenick> meaning i always have to do serialization and deserialization
[23:28:24] <abstrusenick> when the data goes bigger, it will get slower right?
[23:28:35] <Cork> JSON.parse and JSON.stringify is all you need :)
[23:29:15] <abstrusenick> will it get slow, for example if i have 5mb worth of data?
[23:29:35] <Cork> not really
[23:29:55] <Cork> handling 5mb of data in js tends to be... not fast, but not exactly slow
[23:30:09] <Cork> but that doesn't have anything to do with localstorage or indexeddb
[23:44:30] <sviatovigt> hi
[23:44:39] <sviatovigt> if I detach an element
[23:44:50] <sviatovigt> before I put it back on the page
[23:44:54] <sviatovigt> can I change it?
[23:45:32] <Cork> yes
[23:45:42] <sviatovigt> thank you
[23:45:57] <Cork> when you detatch an element you basically put it in a new document with one single element in it
[23:46:18] <tw2113> sort of like your own quick notepad?
[23:46:26] <Cork> kinda :)
[23:46:51] <Cork> and just so its said, you don't need to detatch an element to move it
[23:48:04] <WellWisher> <WellWisher> contact.php code - http://pastebin.com/6xDg0WYW
[23:48:04] <WellWisher> <WellWisher> contact form - http://demos.webinovi.co.cc/site7/index.html
[23:48:04] <WellWisher> <WellWisher> when i select the gbp radio button, the budget values in gbp activates on right
[23:48:04] <WellWisher> <WellWisher> if i select a gbp value and sends form, the values arent printed in mail
[23:48:04] <WellWisher> <WellWisher> but if i select inr radio button, the inr budget values are printed
[23:48:22] <WellWisher> i'm using jquery to activate the budget values using radio buttons
[23:53:13] <raj> Cork, is there a problem with using .focus() or .keypress() in chrome?
[23:53:18] <raj> cuz it seemed to be working before
[23:54:07] <Eviltwin> They work just fine in Chrome
[23:54:48] <raj> why is typing "john" in the textbox beside Company bringing up a results div in firefox, but not in chrome? http://68.44.194.145:8080/asdf/edit-profile?section=occupation
[23:54:59] <raj> is = does
[23:55:12] <raj> oh wait, is = is
[23:55:27] <joshsmith> speaking of compatibility, I have bug reports coming in that something using e.which is breaking in IE
[23:57:14] <Cork> raj: focus is blocked in some cases
[23:57:33] <Cork> raj: but it normally works as long as you give the page some time to load
[23:57:49] <raj> Cork, do you see any issues with my page?
[23:57:54] <raj> or script
[23:58:53] <Cork> raj: the page is to big to locate what causes things, just like that
[23:59:12] <raj> hmm, what do you suggest I do?
[23:59:30] <Cork> well you can start by trying to reproduce the problem in jsfiddle
[23:59:38] <Cork> with just the code needed to see it
