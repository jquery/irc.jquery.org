[00:00:09] <Whirl3d> and there is no default jQuery method $.window()
[00:00:32] <defaultro> i see few js lines on top of it
[00:00:53] <diverdude> anybody know how to set the name of the posted input field in plupload?
[00:00:55] <defaultro> i mean, .js api. Looks like it's not jquery
[00:00:59] <Whirl3d> but do you see jquery anywhere? Or even query.noConflict();
[00:01:08] <defaultro> checking
[00:01:16] <defaultro> no :(
[00:01:35] <coldhead> ?eval $.fn.jquery
[00:01:37] <bot-t> coldhead: "1.4.2"
[00:01:52] <coldhead> if you alert or console.log that value you can see what's what
[00:02:40] <defaultro> i guess i should sleep now, I only have 3 hours to sleep :(
[00:03:16] <defaultro> what my boss wanted me to do is add a welcome box
[00:03:26] <coldhead> these things take time, boss
[00:03:53] <defaultro> the other dev even told me that's it's going to be a tough ride for me
[00:04:09] <defaultro> and we are like 10 hours apart since he's in europe
[00:04:09] <coldhead> that's remarkably honest of him
[00:04:11] <coldhead> but you can do it!
[00:04:24] <defaultro> yes, I believe I can do it but I am pressured by my boss
[00:05:12] <coldhead> let the boss appreciate your honesty OR SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES
[00:05:18] <coldhead> bosses gonna boss
[00:05:52] <defaultro> i told him that I am doing my best to learn it. I guess I have to tell tomorrow that it's becomming harder
[00:06:01] <Zhy> just play the song "let the bodies hit the floor" in your head and hit him in the face :0
[00:06:07] <defaultro> lol
[00:06:50] <defaultro> ok, here. If I need to display a modal window, where would I insert it?
[00:07:30] <coldhead> it depends
[00:07:32] <coldhead> i'm sorry
[00:07:35] <defaultro> np
[00:08:11] <defaultro> i actually added a onload in body to vanish the window he put
[00:08:23] <defaultro> the window is the one I pastebin earlier
[00:08:30] <defaultro> id is window_0
[00:08:36] <coldhead> assuming you've got all the CSS set up and position absolute $('body').append('<div id="modal">hi mom</div>') might get you across the line
[00:09:10] <defaultro> didn't understand that code
[00:09:30] <defaultro> normally, where is that inserted?
[00:09:41] <defaultro> and is that the code that will display a window?
[00:09:43] <coldhead> where does that code go?
[00:09:54] <defaultro> yeah
[00:09:58] <coldhead> if you want it to appear unconditionally
[00:10:03] <coldhead> you could just put in the html
[00:10:10] <coldhead> inside <script></script> tags
[00:10:15] <defaultro> ok
[00:10:19] <coldhead> and wrapped in $(document).ready()
[00:10:33] <coldhead> that code says "select the body element and append this HTML to it"
[00:10:42] <coldhead> you can try it on jsfiddle if you like
[00:10:52] <coldhead> inspect the page with firebug or web inspector
[00:10:55] <coldhead> see what's the dealio
[00:11:04] <defaultro> jsfiddle?
[00:11:17] <defaultro> i have firebug
[00:11:25] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/
[00:11:32] <tw2113> ^
[00:11:35] <coldhead> very nice for experimenting
[00:11:45] <defaultro> ok
[00:11:46] <coldhead> bi-curious
[00:11:51] <ravenzz> lol
[00:11:51] <coldhead> ha ha ha cookies on dowels
[00:13:02] <defaultro> let me quickly explain our app in dev. When we load the page, it displays the window on the left which contains a form. What I want to do is add a welcome screen above it or ideally, hide his window.
[00:13:22] <granden> http://jsfiddle.net/granden/h2ETE/ - If I would like this code to autorun, but stop running when I click on one of the top images
[00:13:26] <granden> how would I accomplish that?
[00:13:33] <anli_> Is there a style for width or height where padding is inset instead of outset?
[00:13:46] <anli_> I have to subtract with the padding when I set width and height
[00:13:54] <onats> hey guys, quick q. In my page, I'm looping through several ajax requests. I'd like to know when all of the ajax requests are successful, and if it is, then redirect to a page. any quick hints?
[00:14:14] <defaultro> small white window. I was able to make this window when I put onload=closewindow() in <body>. However, it closed the window when the page completed loading
[00:15:13] <defaultro> it was a long wait :( but it worked. I don't think it's a good solution. Now, I want to add the welcome window with a close button which will show the window that disappeared
[00:15:53] <coldhead> onats: you need to get educated on jquery deferreds
[00:15:57] <coldhead> ?when @ onats
[00:15:57] <bot-t> onats, jQuery.when(deferreds): Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[00:16:08] <coldhead> its a little bit of a cognitive jump but it will change your life
[00:16:14] <coldhead> and the code is just elegant
[00:16:17] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[00:16:23] <defaultro> another solution I made is to add display: none in the pastebin I posted earlier. It worked. The window didn't load. However, id window_0 could not be found
[00:16:56] <onats> coldhead: thanks for the hint. looking it up now.
[00:18:08] <onats> coldhead: the number of ajax calls I'm doing is not fixed. dynamic based on user input
[00:19:17] <defaultro> or maybe guys, simpler, please help me write a simple modal window inside $(document).ready(function() {
[00:19:20] <coldhead> fine by me, onats
[00:19:40] <onats> coldhead: it seems when can be used if i know the number of ajax calls?
[00:19:48] <defaultro> i won't care if there are some objects underneath this window
[00:20:05] <coldhead> onats: i think i've managed to make it work with arrays
[00:20:13] <coldhead> but check out the other deferred methods
[00:20:19] <coldhead> you can keep adding them dynamically
[00:20:29] <coldhead> i can't remember the method
[00:20:42] <coldhead> but hunt around and if you get boned check back here, someone will know
[00:20:46] <coldhead> or i might look it up
[00:20:54] <coldhead> these pills are starting to kick in though :|
[00:21:17] <coldhead> defaultro: i will do you a very simple trivial demo that might be enough to get you started
[00:21:44] <defaultro> i added $('body').append('<div id="modal">hi mom</div>') in <script></script>
[00:21:54] <defaultro> oh ok
[00:22:01] <defaultro> :)
[00:22:53] <onats> yes, looking up.
[00:22:56] <onats> this is a new concept for me
[00:26:48] <granden> How would I do an autorun function for my code?
[00:26:53] <granden> http://agfoto.se/acte/index.html
[00:28:35] <coldhead> defaultro: http://jsfiddle.net/YhDeJ/
[00:28:43] <defaultro> ok
[00:28:44] <coldhead> that's a simple way to do it if you already have the html in the page
[00:28:51] <coldhead> otherwise you can append it like i showed you before
[00:28:54] <defaultro> yes, the page is already complete
[00:28:57] <coldhead> and there's a click handler to close it
[00:29:02] <defaultro> awesome
[00:29:21] <defaultro> that's exactly what I want
[00:29:23] <defaultro> :)
[00:29:38] <defaultro> ah, a div is required
[00:30:11] <defaultro> can I put text in that modal?
[00:30:25] <defaultro> oh, there is a hi mom :D
[00:32:19] <granden> Really need help, anyone?
[00:32:34] <granden> need an autorun function for my page, but that stops when I press on an image at the top
[00:32:59] <granden> http://agfoto.se/acte/index.html
[00:33:02] <granden> something like that
[00:33:06] <smplstk> "autorun"?
[00:33:34] <granden> yeah, the autorun should switch to the next image
[00:33:38] <granden> and the next and the next and restart
[00:33:53] <granden> but when one image is activley clicked it should stops forever
[00:34:08] <granden> I got the function to switch image on click
[00:34:12] <defaultro> is this ok coldhead, I wrote the <script src to point to http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.pack.js?
[00:34:32] <smplstk> granden: you should just use an existing plugin
[00:34:40] <smplstk> ?g malsup cycle @ granden
[00:34:41] <bot-t> granden, JQuery Cycle Plugin - jQuery Plugins by malsup - http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/
[00:34:49] <NodeX> does anyone know how to bind a click handler to a shart ?
[00:34:51] <Whirl3d> granden, just put a setinterval in you autorun to switch between elements
[00:34:58] <Whirl3d> a shart?
[00:35:05] <NodeX> yeh
[00:35:12] <smplstk> totes just sharted myself
[00:35:18] <Whirl3d> Is that halfway between a shit and a fart? what is a shart?
[00:35:23] <Zhy> XD
[00:35:26] <NodeX> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shart
[00:35:37] <smplstk> lol
[00:35:43] <smplstk> so - we were right?
[00:35:43] <NodeX> shart is like -the- best word ever
[00:36:06] <granden> Whirl3d: I dont get what you mean.
[00:36:12] <granden> setinterval?
[00:36:19] <smplstk> $('.jq').click( shart );
[00:36:29] <NodeX> that video is hilarious
[00:36:37] <Whirl3d> granden lookup setinterval in googles and it'll explain
[00:36:45] <coldhead> defaultro: that's okay but you might prefer to use the Google CDN
[00:36:54] <coldhead> i think it's more common so its more likely to be cached by your user
[00:37:09] <smplstk> coldhead: NO U USE IT
[00:37:23] <defaultro> never heard of it :)
[00:37:45] <Whirl3d> that video is seriously laugh out loud funny
[00:38:50] <Whirl3d> granden, you set a function that changes your images from one to the next. Then you use the setInterval method to execute that function at a given time interval.
[00:40:14] <coldhead> and then you clearTimeout when someone clicks
[00:40:17] <coldhead> ?cc
[00:40:20] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[00:40:33] <Whirl3d> you clearInterval when someone clicks
[00:41:30] <defaultro> not sure what I'm doing wrong
[00:41:48] <granden> Whirl3d: I got it, but I get some error
[00:42:15] <coldhead> you'll have to be more specific, defaultro
[00:42:26] <defaultro> coldhead, pastebin.com/XAesMhwh
[00:42:51] <coldhead> ah
[00:42:53] <Whirl3d> granden, setup a fiddle so we can work with it.
[00:42:59] <granden> Whirl3d: Sure
[00:42:59] <defaultro> does it look fine?
[00:43:06] <coldhead> you can either provide a src OR you can put stuff between the <script></script>s
[00:43:09] <coldhead> but you can't do both
[00:43:17] <coldhead> and even if you do src you need </script>
[00:43:21] <coldhead> you always need </script>
[00:43:22] <defaultro> what?
[00:43:27] <defaultro> oh
[00:43:35] <defaultro> they should be on separate lines?
[00:43:36] <tw2113> use the script luke
[00:43:49] <coldhead> so close the </script> and start a new <script> for your custom JS
[00:44:02] <defaultro> there was and I deleted it :D
[00:44:02] <coldhead> you can never have too much <script></script>
[00:44:05] <defaultro> adding it back
[00:44:07] <tw2113> raise your hand if you have an account with jsfiddle
[00:44:07] <coldhead> you foolish fool!
[00:44:49] * coldhead doesn't move
[00:44:52] <defaultro> BAM!!!!!!!!!!
[00:44:59] <defaultro> i added z-index to 999
[00:45:04] <coldhead> can you please go to sleep now sweet zombie jesus
[00:45:08] <defaultro> hahaha
[00:45:15] <defaultro> you are my saviour
[00:45:23] <defaultro> :D :D :D
[00:45:28] <coldhead> quite
[00:45:33] <coldhead> come back anytime
[00:45:52] <defaultro> i only 2+ hours to go but it's ok, I can show something tomorrow :)
[00:46:13] <defaultro> i mean, I only have 2+ hours to sleep :)
[00:46:32] <coldhead> sweet dreams
[00:46:45] <coldhead> ?donate
[00:46:45] <granden> Whirl3d: Hmm, this is really strange
[00:46:46] <bot-t> want to help support the jQuery project? Donate at http://jquery.org/donate
[00:46:56] <granden> using jsfiddle the set interval wont work at all.
[00:47:02] <granden> http://jsfiddle.net/granden/h2ETE/6/
[00:47:06] <defaultro> you too
[00:48:45] <tw2113> almost 3am mulling...do i need a jsfiddle account?
[00:49:05] <tw2113> i don't use it that much yet
[00:49:11] <coldhead> tw2113: it's good if you blog about stuff and want to take credit for things
[00:49:23] <coldhead> if you just throw shit together for noobs coldhead style there's no need
[00:49:30] <coldhead> and you can leave your disgraces behind
[00:49:41] <coldhead> ZOMG A PUPPY ON A SWING
[00:49:45] <tw2113> yeah, i'm not to the point of js blogging right now
[00:50:37] <granden> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/granden/h2ETE/7/
[00:51:08] <granden> Thats what I got, dont get the error on the jsfiddle but the setinterval dont run either. http://agfoto.se/acte/index.html and using a console there it outputs the error
[00:52:09] <tw2113> night
[00:53:09] <EdwardIII> chaps, any idea how i can get this working in ie8? http://jsfiddle.net/4cN86/3/
[00:53:14] <EdwardIII> i'm in the world of opacity pain
[00:55:44] <g[r]eek> Hey fellas. My $(document).ready(...) is working fine (I've tested it with an alert(...) which works). Now I'm trying to bind an .click() to a button inside my ready(...) function as follows: $("button#test-button").click(function() { alert("button works"); }); ... and this button is part of a table that is loaded dynamically using a separate (old-fashioned) XHR. For some reason the jquery .click(...) on my button isn't firing. Is this n
[00:55:44] <g[r]eek> ormal?
[00:56:06] <NodeX> EdwardIII : what doesn't work about it ?
[00:56:06] <granden> if I got a really big $(function(){ //lots of code here}
[00:56:24] <NodeX> g[r]eek : look at "on"
[00:56:28] <granden> is it possible just to put all that code in a .js file and using script to load that?
[00:56:30] <NodeX> ?on | g[r]eek
[00:56:30] <caniuse> NodeX: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[00:57:03] <NodeX> granden yes but not in the way you are thinking
[00:57:29] <NodeX> you'll need to wrap it in a self executing function so it executes when loaded
[00:57:47] <granden> and that would look like?
[00:58:02] <EdwardIII> NodeX: you don't get opacity: 0 in ie8
[00:58:28] <NodeX> perhaps state that then lol
[00:58:51] <NodeX> http://markdalgleish.com/2011/03/self-executing-anonymous-functions/
[01:00:40] <g[r]eek> NodeX, ok I tried that... $(document).ready(function() {  $("button#my-button").on("click", function(event) { alert("button worked"); }); but still nothing. Did I misinterpret you?
[01:01:49] <NodeX> no and you have it wrong
[01:02:14] <NodeX> $('body').on('click','#my-button',function(event){.....
[01:02:29] <g[r]eek> ah ok let's try that
[01:02:42] <g[r]eek> I have a container table that's already loaded in the page
[01:02:52] <NodeX> you can bind it to that
[01:02:53] <g[r]eek> $("table#my-table").on...
[01:02:55] <g[r]eek> yeah
[01:02:56] <g[r]eek> ok
[01:03:04] <NodeX> dude dont use table#my-table
[01:03:07] <NodeX> it's hella slow
[01:03:13] <NodeX> id is really fast
[01:04:09] <tga> quick check, do I understand correctly that getJSON on '/foo?mycallback=?' will do jsonp?
[01:04:27] <g[r]eek> NodeX, so just go $("#my-table") ?
[01:04:32] <NodeX> yeh
[01:04:48] <coldhead> i would explicitly add dataType: 'jsonp', tga
[01:04:58] <coldhead> so your code isn't gonna break if someone changes the URL
[01:05:11] <NodeX> selectors work right to left so table#foo would get #foo then make sure it's a table ... seeing asID's have to be unique there is no point for the second check
[01:05:20] <tga> coldhead, how do you debug failing jsonp calls anyway?
[01:05:24] <NodeX> as id's *
[01:05:40] <coldhead> tga: very carefully
[01:05:52] <coldhead> like literally inspecting the dom to see if a <script> tag is being added
[01:05:57] <coldhead> and monitoring the network tab
[01:06:01] <coldhead> and hoping against hope
[01:06:19] <NodeX> lololol
[01:06:26] <Azra-el> morning guys ... http://jsfiddle.net/AGAmk/ if anybody could take a look and throw me a bone as to why the increment zindex isnt working as intended (one div for ex starts at 9998 and should become 9999 and instead ands up as 10003)
[01:06:28] <tga> yeah, sounds about right
[01:06:45] <tga> I make a jsonp call, success doesn't run, error doesn't run
[01:07:08] <coldhead> tga: anything in the Network tab of your debugger?
[01:07:24] <coldhead> tga: does the output validate at jsonlint.com ?
[01:07:26] <tga> btw, the latest syntax is to chain ajax().success().error(), right?
[01:07:39] <coldhead> i never chain those guys
[01:07:45] <coldhead> but i think that works
[01:08:33] <NodeX> Azra-el : it wokrs fine here
[01:08:39] <NodeX> works *
[01:08:47] <NodeX> it starts and decrements by 1
[01:11:22] <g[r]eek> NodeX++
[01:11:28] <g[r]eek> It's going like a Boeing
[01:11:31] <g[r]eek> Thanks so much
[01:11:45] <NodeX> ;)
[01:12:04] <EdwardIII> g[r]eek: this? https://github.com/wangxian/nodex
[01:12:55] <NodeX> err ?
[01:12:57] <NodeX> lol
[01:13:25] <g[r]eek> NodeX, regarding your point about $("table#my-table") being slower than $("#my-table"), does this apply to class selectors as well?
[01:13:30] <EdwardIII> heh
[01:13:57] <NodeX> g[r]eek : the general rule of thumb is be more specific on the right and less on the left
[01:14:17] <NodeX> I have a link somewhere that descibes the how's and why's.. 1 sec
[01:14:52] <tga> coldhead, yeah, got it, the wrapper function name was wrong in my json
[01:14:57] <musicman> only the best music on http://www.chc.tv
[01:15:10] <coldhead> eat it musicman
[01:15:16] <coldhead> good work tga!
[01:15:20] <Cork[home]> coldhead: he aleady did :)
[01:15:21] <tga> coldhead, a bit confusing, it's stupid that you have to jump through hoops to get data from a different domain
[01:15:51] <NodeX> http://paulirish.com/2009/perf/
[01:16:00] <tga> coldhead, btw, is there any content that you can just get from a different domain?
[01:16:01] <NodeX> it's not to outdated
[01:16:08] <tga> so maybe not json, but text/etc
[01:20:20] <coldhead> tga: has to be in javascript syntax
[01:20:25] <coldhead> becuase you're fetching a script
[01:20:31] <coldhead> so basically only json
[01:20:41] <coldhead> but json encode your XML or text and you're good to go!
[01:21:02] <coldhead> tga: i am fetching json encoded html from wikipedia here savelat.in
[01:21:05] <coldhead> works great
[01:22:02] <tga> jsonp encoded xml sounds pretty horrible
[01:22:12] <coldhead> sure
[01:22:16] <coldhead> but it works :)
[01:22:20] <tga> instead of just being able to read whatever you want
[01:22:23] <coldhead> jsonp is a hack anyway
[01:22:27] <tga> broken security model
[01:22:30] <coldhead> ah well thank the same origin policy for that
[01:22:39] <tga> right, broken
[01:22:41] <coldhead> until they fix it, here we are
[01:22:46] <coldhead> getting things done
[01:22:48] <tga> since you can get around it with jsonp it's worse than pointless
[01:22:52] <coldhead> impressing the opposite sex
[01:23:00] <tga> with javascript? good luck
[01:23:18] <coldhead> well its worse than that, tga, because to get around it we're not just safely fetching xml from across a domain
[01:23:26] <coldhead> we're fetching and eval()ing js
[01:23:47] <coldhead> just to get at the precious xml inside
[01:24:02] <coldhead> like cracking open a baboons skull to feast on its brain
[01:24:08] <coldhead> poor wretch
[01:24:18] <coldhead> i'm not sure that impresses the opposite sex either
[01:24:30] <coldhead> unless they're into that
[01:24:37] <coldhead> much respect, brain eaters
[01:25:30] <tga> uh right
[01:27:35] <coldhead> I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE WITH ME ON THIS ONE
[01:28:49] <coldhead> man i sure would like to go home soon
[01:29:16] <Zhy> ...but?
[01:30:18] <astropirate> So, you have to start paying for google maps after 25,000 api calls... how does this effect mobile apps that use google maps?
[01:30:32] <g[r]eek> Does anyone here use vim for developing jquery? Any tips on how to fix it's automatic code formatter?
[01:31:26] <Whirl3d> granden, have you got your issue resolved yet. Sorry I stepped away for a minute
[01:31:38] <coldhead> astropirate: won't that just limit each app/IP address to 25,000 calls?
[01:32:08] <coldhead> astropirate: @pamelafox on twitter is good to ask about such things, she knows a bunch about google apps
[01:33:16] <granden> Whirl3d: Yes did solve it.
[01:33:28] <coldhead> astropirate: remember that time you linked to a shostakovich waltz? that was awesome
[01:33:32] <coldhead> more of that
[01:33:44] <Whirl3d> Cool. Sorry to disappear on ya. Glad to hear you got it working
[01:34:48] <Turbohao> i have a <tr> with a <td> and a select element i want to go up 2 levels for the moment i'm using $(this).parent().parent().find($(tr.text()))
[01:35:07] <Turbohao> is there a way i can only use 1 parent?
[01:35:14] <coldhead> ?closest @ Turbohao
[01:35:14] <caniuse> Turbohao: .closest(): Gets an array of all the elements and selectors matched against the current element up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[01:35:17] <Cork[home]> Turbohao: $(this).closest('tr')
[01:35:22] <coldhead> swish
[01:35:38] <Turbohao> thanks gonna try it out :)
[01:37:20] <coldhead> Turbohao: closest is better than counting parents because it will still work if some bozo comes along and adds 30 <span>s around your element
[01:37:25] <coldhead> closest doesn't give a shit
[01:37:27] <Whirl3d> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply   do you get the red error lines that I do?
[01:37:52] <coldhead> i do not, Whirlsy
[01:38:09] <Cork[home]> Whirl3d: its plugin errors in the wiki
[01:38:14] <Cork[home]> it happens from time to time
[01:38:26] <Zhy> reference to undefined name 'syntax'  etc, yupp
[01:38:27] <Cork[home]> one of the admins will prob look at it in a little white
[01:38:29] <Whirl3d> pfew. I thought maybe those _were_ the examples. LOL
[01:38:37] <Whirl3d> it's fine in FF
[01:38:57] <Cork[home]> the browser has nothing to do with it
[01:39:21] <Whirl3d> I see errors when I view it in Chrome, exampels when I view it in FF
[01:40:02] <Cork[home]> it depends on your dns settings
[01:40:14] <Cork[home]> so you get different cdn ends
[01:40:45] <coldhead> guys i am having another nosebleed
[01:41:54] <Whirl3d> weird. I think I even switched my dns to Google's dns (from Comcast), but maybe I didn't move it over with the new router...thanks for the info, Cork, I'll check it out.
[01:42:31] <Cork[home]> Whirl3d: i'v pinged the admin channel to make sure they know about it
[01:42:59] <Cork[home]> Whirl3d: its quite late over there so might take a while before anyone notices
[01:43:47] <Whirl3d> Cool. It's not a priority for me at least. Besides, their examples are kind of special use case..not really applicable or useful for me anyways.
[01:44:14] <Whirl3d> I'm trying to get a better handle on apply
[01:44:21] <ALakra> Hi, I need help with developing a "Loading Screen" with preloads pages and images such as in http://pitch.csspiffle.com/
[01:44:25] <ALakra> Does anyone have any idea ?
[01:44:46] <Cork[home]> Whirl3d: its the syntax highlighting plugin that failes to load (like i said, this happens from time to time) so all exampels on developer.mozilla.org is missing
[01:44:55] <Cork[home]> so its quite a big problem
[01:45:06] <Azra-el> NodeX sorry i was on the phone ...http://jsfiddle.net/AGAmk/1/   the main clicked element decrements properly yes.. but all the other divs of class card dont increment properly ... each should increment by 1 but instead they increment by the number of cards present -1
[01:45:34] <ALakra> I need help with developing a "Loading Screen" with preloads pages and images such as in http://pitch.csspiffle.com/ Does anyone have any idea regarding this ?
[01:47:59] <Whirl3d> Cork, I can see the examples fine in FF like I said. But if you read the context, it's about how to use apply in relation toa couple of special use cases--like function.prototype and recursive max-arguments solutions...not just general examples that show when you should use "this" in a function  that is inteded to be "applied", etc.
[01:48:42] <Whirl3d> oh you were speaking in general. LOL
[01:48:51] <Cork[home]> Whirl3d: and like i said, it has nothing to do with the browser (i see the error in ff) it depends on what cdn you end up on
[01:49:07] <Whirl3d> I thought you were saying that it would be all better if I could see the examples.
[01:49:09] <Cork[home]> and not all cdn's has the plugin error
[01:49:27] <Cork[home]> Whirl3d: no i meant it affects all of developer.mozilla.org
[01:49:35] <Cork[home]> not just that page or a specific browser
[01:50:01] <Whirl3d> sure, sure, sure, but what about _my needs__ lol
[01:50:04] <Cork[home]> and as the cdn updates it will either fix it self, or get worse
[01:50:08] <Cork[home]> lol
[01:50:18] <Cork[home]> Whirl3d: what is it you need? :)
[01:50:46] <Turbohao> it's weird when i use var user = $(this).closest('tr').first().text(); i get the text of everything in that row, but when i try var user = $(this).closest('tr td#user').first().text(); i have nothing
[01:50:58] <Whirl3d> I need some more information about apply. I am writing a plugin to abstract animation and state changes and will probably make extensive use of apply. So I would like to know it better
[01:51:24] <Turbohao> i've tried $(user).find($('td#user')) but didn't work
[01:51:29] <Cork[home]> Turbohao: closers('tr td#user') makes no sence
[01:52:10] <Cork[home]> 1. first you have an id, so no need for any of it just do  $('#user')
[01:52:29] <Turbohao> the problem is that i need the containing tr
[01:52:31] <Azra-el> can anybody pls explain why the items dont increment by 1 in zindex? http://jsfiddle.net/AGAmk/1/
[01:52:37] <Cork[home]> 2. you have to be inside td#user for closest to work in that selector so tr is pointless
[01:52:38] <Turbohao> i have 5 select lists
[01:52:50] <Turbohao> ah i see
[01:53:12] <coldhead> good debugging, Cork
[01:53:14] <Cork[home]> Turbohao: do you have those id's on multible places in your html?
[01:53:16] <coldhead> thank the nice man, Turbohao
[01:53:27] <coldhead> multiple*
[01:53:30] <Turbohao> yes it's bad ;)
[01:53:50] <Cork[home]> Turbohao: its invalid, and makes them impossible to use as id's
[01:54:02] <Turbohao> class instead?
[01:54:05] <Cork[home]> yes
[01:54:08] <Turbohao> ok
[01:54:22] <coldhead> great job everyone, take 5
[01:54:29] <Cork[home]> if you try to find an id on the page, you can ever only get one match
[01:54:43] <Turbohao> ok thanks for the info
[01:55:59] <Trisox> hey Cork
[01:56:02] <Trisox> hey Cork[home]
[01:56:04] <Trisox> coldhead
[01:56:04] <caniuse> Trisox: coldhead: a brand new person to jQuery. Ignore at all costs!!!!!
[01:56:09] <gabriel9|work> morning
[01:56:35] <Trisox> :D lol
[01:56:49] <Whirl3d> for example. when writing a function where I want to use Apply later, should I warp "this" is in a jquery object or can I assume that since I will be applying the method to a jquery object, that "this" is already a jquery object?
[01:57:22] <Cork[home]> Whirl3d: this is an object, thats all thats garanteed
[01:57:23] <gabriel9|work> i need to use some simple animations (move left, right...) but i can't use jQuery. I tried to write myown but they are slow
[01:57:29] <gabriel9|work> any guidlines?
[01:57:34] <Cork[home]> Whirl3d: what object it is depends on what you give to apply
[01:57:44] <Whirl3d> function setCurrent() {this.addClass("current");}   setCurrent.apply($(el),null);
[01:57:55] <Cork[home]> Whirl3d: exactly
[01:58:18] <Cork[home]> Whirl3d: (you don't need the null though)
[01:58:38] <Whirl3d> cool beans. thanks.
[01:59:56] <coldhead> guys when you have 420px or em or pt or w/e in your css, it's a good idea to leave a comment next to it like this: /* Bong on */
[02:00:06] <coldhead> i do that all the time and it always cheers me up when i find it later
[02:00:42] <Whirl3d> soon to be sop for me...
[02:01:49] <coldhead> sop?
[02:02:55] <Whirl3d> standard operating procedure.
[02:03:31] <Whirl3d> and every time I see it, I will crack up thinking about who tought it to me. LOL
[02:04:57] <coldhead> share the love, chief
[02:06:45] <g[r]eek> Hi, when changing a <select> menu option, is it possible to go back to the previously selected option if a certain condition is met?
[02:07:26] <Cork[home]> g[r]eek: either set the old value back, or abort the click event
[02:07:44] <Cork[home]> (not completly sure about the last alternative)
[02:07:50] <g[r]eek> Cork[home], I've bound the event to .change(), would .click() be better? I know about preventDefault()
[02:08:15] <Cork[home]> g[r]eek: no click isn't better, but change happens after the change has happend
[02:08:23] <Cork[home]> so you can't prevent it there
[02:08:32] <g[r]eek> Understood. Ok thanks for the help
[02:08:33] <merlin1978> Is it possible to know what div was clicked inside the iframe?
[02:08:52] <Cork[home]> merlin1978: is the iframe page same domain?
[02:12:17] <Turbohao> works now :)
[02:12:18] <Turbohao> var user = $(this).closest('tr').first();
[02:12:18] <Turbohao>         var name = user.find('td:first').text();
[02:12:30] <Turbohao> and changed the id's to classes
[02:12:39] <Turbohao> thanks for the help
[02:13:32] <merlin1978> Cork[home]: The page inside the iFrame from a different domain
[02:17:56] <Azra-el> can anybody pls explain why the items dont increment by 1 in zindex? http://jsfiddle.net/AGAmk/1/
[02:21:49] <Cork[home]> merlin1978: then no, you can't get any info from inside it
[02:22:02] <IfSixWasNine> use "zIndex" insteed of "z-index"
[02:22:29] <pintofeggs> Azra-el: erm they do
[02:22:30] <Cork[home]> 'z-index' is fine
[02:23:31] <NodeX> Azra-el : As earlier I told you they do, now confirmed by someone else
[02:28:47] <Whirl3d> so .when returns a promise because you can't have access to the resolve/reject deferred methods on the deferred created by .when...right?
[02:28:54] <pintofeggs> Azra-el: what result are you wanting to achieve? Use firebug, you can see that the z-index is de/increasing (which ever way you look at it) fine.
[02:38:30] <Blindie> is there a jquery plugin ore script for crosfading the background when i change the conten/page like this? http://www.thisisbliss.com/
[02:40:05] <Flo0815> Blindie: i think u have to use jquery ui or jquery tools to do a background fade
[02:40:26] <g[r]eek> Hi I'm iterating through a list using $(".my-list").each(...), and each list item has an attribute "foo", how do I select the value of foo inside of my each(...)?
[02:40:44] <Flo0815> g[r]eek: $(this).attr
[02:40:50] <g[r]eek> Flo0815, thanks
[02:41:02] <pintofeggs> Blindie: that site is clunky. Hopw you implement it better
[02:41:15] <Blindie> i hope to :D
[02:41:15] <Flo0815> Blindie: i'm wrong. its the "color plugin" for jquery
[02:41:22] <Flo0815> http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/color
[02:41:42] <Flo0815> seems pretty old...
[02:41:47] <Blindie> okay, but i don't need the collor change, only the background
[02:42:18] <Flo0815> a background image?
[02:42:44] <Blindie> no, the crosfade ;)
[02:43:20] <g[r]eek> Flo0815, ok and I want to get the value of a sub-element of this whose class is known, ie: <li foo='x'><span class='bar'>value</span> more text</li>
[02:44:06] <Flo0815> $(this).children('.bar').html()
[02:44:48] <Flo0815> Blindie: so you have a div with a background color (blue) and you want it to crossfade to red
[02:44:56] <Flo0815> is this right?
[02:45:10] <Blindie> yes but mit image 1 and image 2^^
[02:45:10] <g[r]eek> Flo0815++
[02:45:16] <g[r]eek> And I'm sitting here trying to do it with find()
[02:45:22] <g[r]eek> jQuery is amazing.
[02:45:31] <Flo0815> if you know how to use it :P
[02:45:40] <Flo0815> blindie ger?
[02:46:18] <Blindie> yes^^
[02:46:26] <Flo0815> dann können wir es auch einfach haben :)

[02:48:06] <Angelos_> hi there guys, I have a conflict with jquery, I tried no conflict but it still does not work and I cannot fix this. I am sure it's only something very small in the script that needs correcting.
[02:48:16] <Flo0815> nimm nen separaten div, positioniere den absolute genau hinter den content-div
[02:48:33] <Blindie> die seite hat das ja
[02:48:40] <Flo0815> und lag da dann wiederum 2 divs rein
[02:48:54] <Flo0815> oh warte ma, das hab ich doch vor kurzem programmiert...
[02:48:54] <Blindie> okay
[02:48:55] <Flo0815> sec
[02:49:03] <Azra-el> NodeX , pintofeggs ... im using developer tools in chrome ... and it is as follows card_0 starts at zindex 9999 and when clicked ends up with zindex 9998 cards (it shouldnt because the operation is curzindex(9999) - numCards(6) +1 so it should be 9994 but its 9998 . the rest of the divs with the card class end up with 10003 zindex even tho they should just incremebt by 1 their current zindex
[02:49:10] <Angelos_> can anybody help me
[02:49:31] <Blindie> es soll nur gut aussehen
[02:50:33] <Blindie> achja, die seite ist in 2 bereiche unterteilt, sagen wir mal links ist ein 200px breiter bereich mit nem logo, nen paar menüpunkten und text und der rest ist nen bild
[02:50:55] <Flo0815> blindie: http://jsfiddle.net/wHQS7/
[02:51:15] <Flo0815> das is meine funktion, läuft mit nem interval, der alle 20 sekunden nen bg-image fade macht
[02:51:41] <Blindie> geht das auch auch onclick?
[02:51:59] <Blindie> also das bei nem klick auf nen link der inhalt nachgeladen wird und das bild fadet?
[02:52:00] <Flo0815> http://jsfiddle.net/wHQS7/1/
[02:52:10] <Flo0815> da is noch css dabei
[02:52:58] <Blindie> achja, das bild soll sich dynamisch dem browser anpasse und scallieren
[02:53:05] <Flo0815> jo klar, musst nur die funktion aufrufen, z.b. changeWallpaper(1,1);
[02:53:25] <Flo0815> wobei du den parameter currentBgIndex nicht brauchst
[02:53:52] <Flo0815> doch brauchst du
[02:54:16] <Flo0815> so könnts gehn: http://jsfiddle.net/wHQS7/2/

[02:55:03] <Angelos_> Can anybody help me, I have a question
[02:55:09] <Flo0815> !ask
[02:55:17] <Flo0815> ?ask
[02:55:22] <Angelos_> I have a jquery conflict, I tried no conflict, http://www.pricklypearmedia.com/clients/vorelmedia/index_1.htm
[02:55:33] <Angelos_> the lightbox 2 does not work with the style switcher
[02:55:44] <Flo0815> use 'jQuery' instead of '$'
[02:56:07] <Angelos_> how would that work?
[02:56:11] <Angelos_> in which file?
[02:56:29] <Flo0815> instead of $('#foo'). -> jQuery('#foo').
[02:56:46] <Flo0815> the $ get overwritten sometimes by other javascripts
[02:57:03] <Angelos_> ok okay, I will try it
[02:59:41] <Angelos_> @Flo0815 I don't think I can
[02:59:53] <Zhy> Does anyone have an idea why special characters like ß öäü é è ê etc get "destroyed" to codes when they go through my javascript? If I save some data using only php it works fine, my table is utf8_general_ci , but when I use autocomplete or inline edit, the special characters aren't displayed correctly, instead it displays for example  &amp;eacute;
[03:01:19] <Zhy> (example: inline edit - after I hit enter and the textbox used for the edit becomes a label with the newly edited value, it is displayed correctly, on page reload though it's incorrect (retrieved from table))
[03:03:09] <Flo0815> Angelos_ why?
[03:08:53] <Whirl3d> Zhy, I don't know exactly why, but perhaps you could decode them back automatically.
[03:09:24] <Flo0815> how can i stop all animations?
[03:09:29] <Flo0815> for multiple elements
[03:09:40] <Flo0815> $('body').stop() ?

[03:45:44] <pbogdan> trying to get a list of event handlers attached to an element with $(element).data("events") and it's not working - any ideas why? (jquery 1.7.2)
[03:45:57] <pbogdan> or any other way to do the same thing?
[03:47:11] <g[r]eek> Flo0815, ok so I passed my 2d javascript array as a data parameters in my $.ajax call but when I output the http request body it just says "undefined=undefined&undefined=undefined&undefined=undefined&undefined=undefined&undefined=undefined&undefined=undefined"
[03:47:17] <wltoriginal> Hi all. Can I bind a jquery event to an ok click on a plain javascript alert window?
[03:47:49] <g[r]eek> wltoriginal, rather use confirm() instead of alert() and check the returned value from confirm()
[03:49:44] <wltoriginal> g[r]eek: thanks!
[03:51:50] <shoky> pbogdan: works for me
[03:52:14] <pbogdan> shoky: thanks; what jquery version you using?
[03:52:26] <shoky> same
[03:53:16] <soee> if i have container with some smaller boxes and some of them are hidden, when i hide and than show again container all elements become visible inside - can i prevent that ?
[03:53:35] <g[r]eek> Can I convert my javascript array to a json array?
[03:53:47] <shoky> g[r]eek: JSON.stringify
[03:54:37] <shoky> ?bot

[03:54:43] <g[r]eek> thanks
[04:09:13] <ofcan> hi! I have pinterest like layout in wich I use jQuery and absolute positioning. Everything is great except my footer nom jumps to top of the page (because of this absolute positioning blocks...). How to get the footer down using some simple jQuery?
[04:11:47] <shoky> position:fixed ?
[04:12:47] <xec|work> bottom: 0; ?
[04:13:22] <shoky> xec: hi; ?
[04:14:04] <ofcan> shoky: doesn't work...
[04:14:15] <ofcan> xec|work: nope...
[04:14:18] <xec|work> shoky: hotpink; ?
[04:14:46] <xec|work> ofcan: did you try both rules at the same time
[04:15:01] <ofcan> xec|work: yup...
[04:15:10] <xec|work> ?demo @ ofcan
[04:15:16] <xec|work> bot-t: COME ON
[04:15:23] <xec|work> ofcan: do you have a live url?
[04:15:23] <shoky> ?demo <-- clear enough
[04:16:08] <xec|work> shoky: yeah it should be, i just look less silly when i get some response :p
[04:16:53] <shoky> nah ;)
[04:17:52] <shoky> Jesus is the son of God which would mean he is a man. So I would think that I would still be a WOMAN of God when I die. lol. Really People? And the hetersexual marriage thing....lol....with the religions.
[04:18:05] <ofcan> check this out, this guy just answered me, but dont know exactly how to pull this off... http://benholland.me/javascript/how-to-build-a-site-that-works-like-pinterest/#comment-199
[04:20:37] <shoky> ofcan: we cant help you without knowing what exactly the issue is
[04:21:24] <dwr^> #java
[04:21:29] <dwr^> woops
[04:22:19] <ofcan> so my question is this: i need to assign this  $('.some_class').height(); to be the value of the margin-top of some other class. how to do it?
[04:22:21] <xec|work> dwr^: i agree java is comparable to an accident, but you can't hashtag your messages on irc like you can on twitter
[04:22:35] <dwr^> hehe :p
[04:22:51] <dwr^> I was missing /join ;)
[04:23:00] <xec|work> yeah i know ;)
[04:23:31] <Cork[home]> ofcan: you mean the height of all elements with that class?
[04:23:32] <xec|work> too bad my sarcastic tone is so hard to type
[04:23:50] <dwr^> I sort of guessed, but I wasn't really sure ;)
[04:24:16] <dwr^> Thought it better to comment than to ignore it ;)
[04:24:22] <shoky> oops sorry for pasting that jesus line, it was for another channel ;)
[04:24:33] <xec|work> shoky: i thought it was completely valid
[04:24:37] <ofcan> Cork[home]: .some_class is the container. I have to calculate the height of the container to calculate the margin-top of the footer
[04:24:37] <shoky> it was!!!
[04:26:20] <xec|work> ofcan: $('.otherClass').height($('.some_class').height()) ?
[04:26:29] <suedoh> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'submit' of null
[04:26:33] <suedoh> Any idea of what could cause this?
[04:26:48] <shoky> calling submit on something that is null
[04:26:50] <suedoh> http://ideone.com/4Cm3o
[04:26:53] <suedoh> Here is the code
[04:26:55] <xec|work> shoky++
[04:27:02] <suedoh> The  <form name="domainSearch" id="domainSearch"> ... </form>   exists
[04:27:33] <xec|work> suedoh: what is $?
[04:27:41] <shoky> MONAY
[04:27:48] <Cork[home]> ofcan: var height = 0; $('.some_class').each(function() { height += $(this).height(); }); $('footer').css('margin-top', height + 'px');
[04:28:10] <shoky> touchdown
[04:28:34] <suedoh> xec|work, The jquery function yes?
[04:28:35] <xec|work> oh yeah, mine was a bit stupid wasnt it
[04:28:40] <Cork[home]> ofcan: though you should prob do that another way it sounds to me
[04:28:45] <xec|work> suedoh: that's what i'm asking. is your site live?
[04:28:51] <suedoh> Yes
[04:28:56] <suedoh> Jquery Exists
[04:29:07] <xec|work> suedoh: and is jQuery === $?
[04:29:48] <suedoh> Not sure what that means I'm sorry
[04:29:58] <suedoh> but I have code above it that works
[04:30:19] <xec|work> suedoh: link us to your page or we can't do anything but guess wildly
[04:30:27] <suedoh> Oh, I just got it
[04:30:28] <shoky> $ = function(){return null}
[04:30:34] <suedoh> My code wasn't inside the function
[04:30:38] <suedoh> Yes Shoky, you are right
[04:30:39] <suedoh> :-(
[04:30:41] * suedoh sighs
[04:30:41] <shoky> what?!
[04:30:43] * suedoh slaps himself
[04:30:45] <xec|work> rofl
[04:30:47] * shoky slaps himself too
[04:30:53] <suedoh> heh
[04:30:57] <shoky> i was totally joking anyway ;0
[04:32:28] <xec|work> i'm totally scatter that line around some pages just to see what shitty plugins break
[04:32:43] <xec|work> totally gonna*
[04:34:10] <shoky> ;D
[04:45:09] <ofcan> xec|work: doesnt work :/
[04:45:22] <ofcan> Cork[home]: tried and doesnt work...
[04:45:32] <xec|work> ofcan: is your site live?
[04:46:02] <ofcan> xec|work: nope
[04:46:46] <shoky> ofcan: either link us to a live demo or create one that demonstrates your problem on jsfiddle.net
[04:47:03] <ofcan> shoky: ok, will do
[04:48:03] <xec|work> remove any unnecessary parts
[05:02:40] <ofcan> guys! this is what I meant... this guy figured it out (heres live demo). Thank you for all the help! http://benholland.me/labs/pinterest/demo-container.php
[05:04:21] <Cork[home]> ofcan: you will have to loop the elements, find the element with the highest value for position().top + height, and use that
[05:04:58] <ofcan> Cork[home]: yes, looking at source shows it
[05:07:21] <Cork[home]> i meant: var height = 0; $('.block').each(function() { var $self = $(this); var pos = $self.position().top + $(this).height(); if(height < pos) { height = pos; } });
[05:07:33] <raven_king> hi #jquery!..I am trying to use the jquery plugin 'tipsy' to display fancy tooltips under the team members' names in this page: http://trayee.com/v2/company/10-team . I am getting an "Uncaught typeError: object Object has no method 'tipsy'. What am i doing wrong? I have tried searching to no avail. Please help me out...Thanks!
[05:09:06] <soee> can i call some function every time some form filed is changed?
[05:09:51] <xec|work> raven_king: you have jquery included twice
[05:10:09] <raven_king> oh..
[05:10:20] <raven_king> will check and see if it solves it..thanks!
[05:12:11] <xec|work> raven_king: once with jquery-1.7.2.min.js and then again with jquery-1.js - which is version 1.2.6 and overwriting, by the looks of it
[05:13:43] <raven_king> oh....jquery 1.2.6 is universal to all pages..so ill try removing 1.7.2 and see..
[05:13:46] <suedoh> Hey guys, I want to programmatically change a bxSlider attribute after it's been initialized.  I'm not too familiar with Js and jQuery to know how to do that.  Can you please provide me with an example?  http://bxslider.com/options
[05:14:17] <suedoh> I'm thinking of just doing the same thing as the initialization, but I don't want it to re-initialize, I want to just change an attribute
[05:14:23] <suedoh> While it's live
[05:16:08] <xec|work> raven_king: then you also need to make sure the plugins are included after jquery is, and are compatible with such an old version
[05:16:23] <shoky> suedoh: what attribute
[05:16:39] <jpcody> hey all, wondering if it's possible to actually change a user's tab position in a document programatically. that is, I'd like to open a modal that's appended to the <body>, having the keyboard + native visual focus already on "cancel" -- anyone know if it's possible?
[05:16:44] <suedoh> shoky:  I want to change the 'pause' time
[05:16:50] <raven_king> ol..thanks..now iam getting a 'jquery not defined'..qill fix it
[05:16:59] <raven_king> will*
[05:17:08] <suedoh> I'm doing a onAfterSlide:,  and after it reaches a certain count of slides, I want it to slow down
[05:18:21] <suedoh> It doesn't look like bxSlider even provides a way of doing it programmatically
[05:21:06] <rosieres> anybody experienced with html5 video-tag and color problems ?
[05:21:54] <shoky> suedoh: yea doesn't look like it
[05:22:56] <raven_king> xec|work: I have commented out the older version but the error persists. Also, jquery is called before the plugins..wat else could i be doing wrong
[05:22:57] <raven_king> ?
[05:24:25] <suedoh> shoky, sucks
[05:26:58] <xec|work> raven_king: i'm not entirely sure, do you have more jquery versions slapped in there?
[05:27:14] <raven_king> no only those two..the remaining are plugins
[05:27:17] <xec|work> raven_king: $().jquery returns "1.6.4"
[05:27:27] <raven_king> ??
[05:27:38] <xec|work> which is inconsistent with the file name
[05:27:52] <raven_king> will look into it...sry not my code..this is very confusing
[05:28:12] <xec|work> yeah looks like a mess, good luck mate ;D
[05:29:09] <smykes> Anyone recomend an image rotation plugin that lets you define the rotation point
[05:34:09] <raven_king> xec|work: thanks for your help :)
[05:34:39] <xec|work> did you get it sorted?
[05:35:13] <raven_king> nowp..guess i'll ask the author to handle it at a later time..been tryin to figure it out since afternnon
[05:35:39] <lathan> hey
[05:35:47] <lathan> what's the issue?
[05:37:13] <xec|work> raven_king: looks like there's something else trying to use $ as a var as well - 10 bucks says it's mootools
[05:41:13] <heldndd> #iosdev
[05:42:17] <raven_king> xec|work: will try commenting out mootools. also, i've changed the plugin to the one provided by bootstrap now and placed it in the global template..will post back the results
[05:42:23] <ateam_> is it possible to use: http://dev.jtsage.com/jQM-SimpleDialog/demos/string.html with phonegap?
[05:44:53] <xec|work> ateam_: i don't see why not, but i have never tried phonegap myself. there is a separate channel for mobile that is probably better suited: #jquerymobile
[05:45:56] <meskalito> hi
[05:46:15] <meskalito> how can i find link and script count in html string?
[05:46:25] <meskalito> i need to do it before inserting into DOM
[05:46:30] <ateam_> xec|work: mhh ok, cant get it running
[05:55:04] <cantsee> question: i have multiple sites on diffrent domains and each of these sites has a div that i want the other sites to share with each other how can i retrive that particular div
[05:56:27] <xec|work> you can party like it's 1999 and sport an iframe
[05:56:34] <sean`> cantsee, there are a variety of optinos you have
[05:57:00] <sean`> You can either use a scraper mechanisme that fetches the content serverside (so you do an $.get ('proxy?get=http://..')

[05:57:25] <subdesign> hi, after ajax request, why i cant redirect the browser? i use window.location
[05:57:27] <sean`> that one cantsee
[05:57:46] <sean`> or you can use something ilke YUI or AJAX (if you specify the specific settings using a .htaccess you can allow cross domain)
[05:57:59] <sean`> subdesign, you should be able to, what code are you using to redirect?
[05:58:13] <sean`> window.location = 'http://mynewlocation.com/foobar/' should work fine
[05:58:40] <subdesign> sean`, hm do nothing. wait i paste my code
[05:59:08] <subdesign> http://hastebin.com/bebasivude.lua
[05:59:11] <cantsee> sean` , thanks
[05:59:56] <sean`> subdesign, .replace is a method not a property
[06:00:08] <sean`> location.replace (' .. foobar .. ')
[06:00:11] <meskalito> why $().load isn't fired when css or js is already loaded?
[06:00:14] <sean`> not location.replace = '..';
[06:00:17] <meskalito> it fires only first time
[06:00:20] <sean`> location.href = ' ... foobar .. ' will work fine
[06:00:40] <subdesign> sean`, nice i get it from stackov. but without that also no success
[06:00:54] <meskalito> i open ajax popup with script and link inside, event is fired and everything is fine
[06:00:59] <meskalito> then i close ajax popup, open it again
[06:01:04] <meskalito> event isn't fired anymore
[06:01:14] <meskalito> after page refresh it fires again first time
[06:01:20] <subdesign> sean`, do i need return false or something?
[06:01:39] <meskalito> or is there a way to check if link or script is loaded?
[06:02:49] <subdesign> sean`, replacing success to complete, now redirects
[06:03:52] <subdesign> sean`, but thank you !

[06:10:52] <systemfault> Why would jquery have that?
[06:11:46] <james13433> Having brain ache at the moment
[06:12:08] <james13433> I need to check if we have multiple products in this and I am not sur show http://pastebin.com/s8dwug5f
[06:13:01] <tillMorning> I see that: $('.sidebar_content_new').load('http://localhost/test/test2.html'); LOADS test2.html and all entire page after sidebar_content_new disappears. Why it happens? Shouldn't it load test2.html *ONLY* in sidebar_content_new class DIV? How I should do it? I need to load it (test2.html) Into this 'sidebar_content_new' DIV and after that have all entire page?
[06:13:42] <systemfault> james13433: Create a map with that data…
[06:14:21] <systemfault> tillMorning: The string in .load also takes a selector after the url (separated by a space)
[06:14:38] <brandonc503_pc> how can i call jqurery inline?

[06:14:44] <granden> woops sorry
[06:15:07] <granden> http://pastebin.com/Df948zT6
[06:15:09] <granden> I got like that
[06:15:14] <james13433> systemfault I don't know how I would to make it work
[06:15:21] <cantsee> sean`, thanks heaps the I went for a web scraper. googled and found one worked straight out the box
[06:15:24] <granden> and it adds the class to fast
[06:15:29] <systemfault> brandonc503_pc: You don't…
[06:15:36] <granden> I want it to add it first when the animate function is ready
[06:15:42] <granden> now it adds before it even starts.
[06:15:44] <tillMorning> systemfault: Could you please explain? How i can load it only into a DIV and have all rest page?
[06:16:01] <brandonc503_pc> o
[06:16:53] <james13433> I could just change the way the data comes in if the problem is how its layer out
[06:17:30] <systemfault> james13433: You should not modify the way the data is returned from the server, it should be kept simple.
[06:17:37] <systemfault> james13433: Just process it client-side
[06:18:26] <systemfault> james13433: Also.. I'm not certain why you have products with the same id and val
[06:18:57] <james13433> to be honest system fault I have names it wrong, "product" should say options
[06:19:09] <james13433> they are the options that make up the main product
[06:19:28] <james13433> and you can't have certain option combinations which I am trying to check]
[06:23:46] <james13433> so it should be like http://pastebin.com/X4MZQ6Z6

[06:26:56] <Trisox> you mean machine!
[06:26:58] <Trisox> :D
[06:27:00] <james13433> system fault your recommending I do something with jQuery.map() ?
[06:34:37] <james13433> anyone else?
[06:35:16] <james13433> Or anyone know where I can hire someone quickly to help me out with this?
[06:35:58] <xjiujiu> do you have problem?
[06:37:29] <Whirl3d> james13433, map is the write answer, but what is the question?
[06:38:14] <Whirl3d> write answer, get it.? nvm.
[06:38:30] <webchaos> hello
[06:38:30] <james13433> xjiujiu yes
[06:38:40] <james13433> no I don't get it Whirl3d
[06:38:52] <Whirl3d> nvm, What is the issue at hand?
[06:39:22] <james13433> Im not sure how to get it in a way I can check if we have options with id x and val x
[06:39:51] <Whirl3d> james, get what?
[06:40:00] <webchaos> guys i am attempting to do a /ajax with a valid url, however the console in chrome says its a 404 error. the page i am trying to load contains a simple php echo of content. any idea what would cause the 404?
[06:40:02] <Whirl3d> what are you trying to do with this data
[06:40:18] <webchaos> .ajax call sorry
[06:40:30] <xjiujiu> james,do you want to get a element by id?
[06:40:33] <james13433> I each attribute Id is a select box, the gals are the <options>
[06:40:44] <tillMorning> I see that: $('.sidebar_content_new').load('http://localhost/test/test2.html'); LOADS test2.html and all entire page after sidebar_content_new disappears. Why it happens? Shouldn't it load test2.html *ONLY* in sidebar_content_new class DIV? How I should do it? I need to load it (test2.html) Into this 'sidebar_content_new' DIV and after that have all entire page?
[06:41:32] <james13433> Whirl3d I need to say based on what the pevious select selection, which values in the next select box are allowed.
[06:41:37] <xjiujiu> try this $('#select_id').find('option').each(function () {  //your code});
[06:41:45] <james13433> Maybe I should put up a quick jsfiddle?
[06:42:34] <tillMorning> when I use load
[06:42:36] <tillMorning> for example:
[06:42:37] <tillMorning> $('.sidebar_content_new').load('http://localhost/test/test2.html');
[06:42:44] <tillMorning> it loads this page but all entire page is gone
[06:43:55] <webchaos> code assocated to my 404 eror is here: http://jsfiddle.net/bNhHA/
[06:45:25] <Whirl3d> James, where are you getting that data from? Is it your structure or are you getting if from an outside source?
[06:45:39] <venus_> if you go to this website and scroll down the page, you will notice the navigation bar stick to the top, what is this site using ?
[06:45:48] <venus_> http://unionstationdenver.com/
[06:45:54] <james13433> Whirld3d yes its my structure.
[06:48:54] <Whirl3d> I just don't get the way you have it organized.
[06:49:01] <Whirl3d> I assume that you have two products
[06:49:15] <Whirl3d> each product has two possible configurations
[06:49:50] <Whirl3d> and within those configurations,you have four options (to be set for each configuration)?
[06:50:25] <james13433> Whirld3d that is one product, with 4 different cofiguation combinations
[06:50:44] <james13433> which are 2 select drop downs,
[06:51:07] <james13433> 3 colours and one of the colours has two size options
[06:51:59] <walles> http://pastebin.com/dL4Ej4Vq how can i use .hover when i hover the image, autoPlay will off ?
[06:52:03] <walles> any one can help ?
[06:54:21] <Whirl3d> var shirts={name:"shirts", colorOptions:["red","blue","green"], sizeOptions:{red:"size10', blue:size12', green:['size10', size12']}}
[06:55:03] <walles> http://pastebin.com/dL4Ej4Vq how can i use .hover when i hover the image, autoPlay will off ?
[06:55:03] <walles> any one can help ?
[06:55:21] <mlechner> if I add a layer to an already active SelectFeature Control, do I have to .deactivate() .activate() the Control to make it realise its extented layerlist? Or is there smarter way to add a layer to a SelectFeature Control?
[06:55:41] <Napolion> Im looking at jquery-graceful-websocket and Im wondering if this is what ppl recommend for implementing sockets with graceful degradation, or is there a more awesome approach. Anyone got experience?
[06:55:42] <mlechner> sorry wrong list - this is for OpenLayers
[06:55:57] <james13433> Whirld3d problem is its not always colours of sidze, so How would I know what key to use
[06:57:08] <Whirl3d> james13433, you are being so weird about disclosing what you are trying to do. Are you making an ordering system. I mean, what is it that you are trying to do with this data? You seem franticly in need of help, but I think you need to figure out what you want before you can get any help.
[06:57:23] <Whirl3d> If you wan to create two dropdown lists, it's easy
[06:57:44] <james13433> Yes I do whirl3d. But I need to not show some of those options based on whats selected
[06:57:53] <Whirl3d> you just have to isolate your values from the data you have availale
[06:58:09] <james13433> hmm
[06:58:18] <Whirl3d> so what is the first selector
[06:58:22] <Whirl3d> select what
[06:58:27] <Whirl3d> select size?
[06:58:30] <Whirl3d> Color"
[06:58:32] <Whirl3d> Make
[06:58:33] <Whirl3d> Model
[06:58:34] <james13433> It depends thats the problem
[06:58:41] <james13433> It can be absolutely anything
[06:58:42] <Whirl3d> the FIRST selector depends
[06:58:53] <Whirl3d> than you cannot prepare for that
[06:58:53] <james13433> colour, make, manufacturre
[06:59:02] <hlveheart> Heyo dudes. Anyone have any hacks for IE8/9 to make the Transform CSS3 in Bootstrap actually animate?
[06:59:20] <Whirl3d> so it is going to be the attribute that you  want to use for the second selector
[06:59:22] <hlveheart> I've tried all the 'add transform to IE' javascript fixes, none of them did anything lol
[06:59:40] <Whirl3d> So the first selector is going to be called SELECTION TYPE:
[06:59:42] <james13433> because its a quick order form, and I am pulling in products, which will have different configurable options
[06:59:57] <Whirl3d> So the first selector is the product type
[07:00:02] <james13433> no
[07:00:02] <james13433> ]
[07:00:08] <hlveheart> :{
[07:00:29] <Whirl3d> How can you look at options for a product that you don't even know what kind of product is is?
[07:00:47] <james13433> welcome to my world
[07:01:01] <james13433> The attributes come in through json, and will have an attribute id
[07:01:13] <james13433> that matched to the attribute if in those options, i.e attribute75
[07:01:15] <Whirl3d> THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE DATA
[07:01:28] <Whirl3d> this is about the logic and what you want to get out of it.
[07:01:51] <Whirl3d> you can't have a quickorder form where you pick configurations of object hat you don't even know what they are
[07:01:51] <xjiujiu> :D
[07:01:58] <james13433> whilrd3d I would link you too an example, but my internet is down for 10 mineuts
[07:02:04] <webchaos> can someone have a look at http://jsfiddle.net/bNhHA/1/ and tell me if they see why my function call returns a 404 for a valid URL please
[07:02:25] <sean`> webchaos, what's the absolute url of your page?
[07:02:38] <sean`> webchaos, and what's the absolute url of the page this script is executed on?
[07:02:54] <Whirl3d> It's like if I asked you which you wanted and gave you these options: Salami, four wheel drive, applesauce, eletro-stimulate, green
[07:02:59] <Whirl3d> it doesn't make sense
[07:03:06] <webchaos> i tried adding the absolute URL in the script but it still returns a 404
[07:03:07] <sean`> Whirl3d, wha's up?
[07:03:20] <Whirl3d> but if you pick a subject, like "GREEN" then we can find all the green elements that fit
[07:03:22] <james13433> Whirl3d it all comes from the database so theres no problem there
[07:03:24] <sean`> webchaos, I asked you two questions, if you want help answer both with URL's not something else.
[07:04:01] <james13433> They are grouped by subject id, however I just can't be sure what that subject id will be
[07:04:05] <xjiujiu> webchaos,use the full url address.
[07:04:12] <Whirl3d> it doesn't matter
[07:04:46] <james13433> Thanks for you help anyways.
[07:04:53] <Whirl3d> let's approach this another way:
[07:05:09] <xjiujiu> and make sure the request file is exists.
[07:05:09] <Whirl3d> Show me the exact data that you get from which you plan to make a quick order form
[07:05:09] <sean`> james13433, what's the problem
[07:05:24] <Whirl3d> sean, read back in the text, you'll see
[07:05:38] <james13433> Whirl3d, if you give me 10 mins I will do, until then I can't get on paste bin cause of the internet
[07:05:51] <Whirl3d> how are you on IRC?
[07:06:29] <james13433> Lol its because I haven't paid this months yet, for some reason they are just blocking http
[07:06:59] <sean`> lol
[07:07:02] <systemfault> what...
[07:07:07] <smykes> Whirl3d can you not call a click() on document ready
[07:07:19] <sean`> That sentense belongs in Ripley's Believe it or not
[07:07:23] <Whirl3d> huh?
[07:07:29] <aquatix> james13433: tunnel http over an ssh connection to a machine that has a good connection ;)
[07:08:20] <smykes> Whirl3d I want a button to be clicked as soon as the page loads
[07:08:38] <Whirl3d> so on document.ready call the click
[07:08:52] <xjiujiu> :D
[07:09:03] <Whirl3d> $(document).ready(function () {$(el).click()});
[07:09:20] <johnkpaul> smykes: you want to click the button for what end?
[07:09:21] <smykes> I did, its not working, just wanted to make sure it was possible before i debugged
[07:09:28] <johnkpaul> you want it to submit a form
[07:09:32] <johnkpaul> or you want to fire the click handlers?
[07:09:37] <smykes> click handlers
[07:09:49] <johnkpaul> oh, then that should work
[07:10:10] <johnkpaul> .trigger("click") is often used as well, I prefer it
[07:10:12] <sean`> it would be illogical to call .submit() on the form..
[07:10:21] <sean`> good thinking on the .click()
[07:10:25] <xjiujiu> smykes, use the chrome develop tools.
[07:10:46] <Whirl3d> me too
[07:10:49] <Whirl3d> the trigger thng
[07:11:04] <smykes> ugh i have to go fix a bug
[07:11:10] <smykes> THIS IS WHY WE CANT HAVE NICE THINGS
[07:11:13] <granden> Is there a list for all easing functions in jquery?
[07:11:17] <granden> for the animate function
[07:11:40] <Whirl3d> you can find the list in the easing plugin....
[07:11:41] <johnkpaul> granden: jquery itself only has two
[07:11:47] <johnkpaul> ?animate @granden
[07:11:47] <bot-t> granden, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[07:12:02] <johnkpaul> linear and something-that-I-always-forget, but you can find it in those docs
[07:12:09] <Whirl3d> swing
[07:12:19] <granden> Ah
[07:12:29] <granden> Ok, need ui otherwise?
[07:12:41] <Whirl3d> Just the jquery.easing 1.3 plugin
[07:12:48] <Whirl3d> then you can use all kinds of easing
[07:13:05] <sean`> granden, http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/#easing (for additional)
[07:13:44] <granden> Ah, ok
[07:13:46] <granden> Thanks a lot

[07:23:45] <Mac_Weber> hello
[07:24:48] <arnpro> hey guys! I need help programming a plugin for attaching it to an obj and then just call it's inside functions in http://jsfiddle.net/arnpro/AWT8u/3/, I first would like to initliaze var $scroller = $('#content).vScroll(options); and then be able to call like $scroller.reattachScroll() or $scroller.goto(4);, what am I missing in that plugin? I have tried the
[07:24:49] <Mac_Weber> how to get the oldURL and newURL from the 'hashchange' on IE? I'm getting undefined on IE, but it is working fine on FF   http://pastebin.com/DeG048xn
[07:25:39] <johnkpaul> Mac_Weber: it's because you need to check window.event, or use jquery's bbq plugin to handle it
[07:25:44] <johnkpaul> I thought we talked about all of this yesterday :)
[07:27:11] <shoky> arnpro: you can do $this.goto = function(..){...}
[07:27:19] <johnkpaul> arnpro: if you have multiple plugin methods, a diffrent pattern might be more useful https://github.com/addyosmani/jquery-plugin-patterns/blob/master/patterns/jquery.namespace.plugin-boilerplate.js
[07:28:00] <Mac_Weber> johnkpaul: It is using BBQ, I learned it is on the core of Drupal
[07:28:57] <shoky> $.fn.mynamespace_myPluginName  ;S
[07:29:22] <johnkpaul> Mac_Weber: what version? did you read the docs? hashchange might actually be separate
[07:29:24] <johnkpaul> Mac_Weber: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/docs/files/jquery-ba-bbq-js.html#jQuery_hashchange_event
[07:29:25] <arnpro> shoky johnkpaul ok I'll try that guys, however, that vScroll plugin it's somebody else's, but I need to make it work with a custom "scrollbar", I already made it draggable and that stuff, but how difficult you think it'll be to have it work with the plugin itself?

[07:34:19] <Mac_Weber> johnkpaul: let check...
[07:41:51] <Mac_Weber> johnkpaul: ok, it seems the BBQ .js is on the system, but it is not loaded by default =P
[07:42:00] <Jagan> hi
[07:43:05] <EdwardIII> hey guys
[07:43:11] <EdwardIII> any idea how i can get this working in ie8? http://jsfiddle.net/4cN86/7/
[07:43:45] <shoky> EdwardIII: set the opacity on the <li>s
[07:44:38] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: you're sure you've forced the uls to have layout, right?
[07:44:47] <johnkpaul> like if you check in the ie debug tools
[07:45:08] <johnkpaul> by default a ul does not have layout
[07:45:08] <shoky> EdwardIII: http://jsfiddle.net/4cN86/9/   if you wanna set the li's
[07:45:23] <EdwardIII> http://jsfiddle.net/4cN86/10/
[07:45:53] <EdwardIII> shoky:my and your examples are slightly different - but mine seems to work in ie8 now
[07:45:58] <EdwardIII> why on earth is that?
[07:46:02] <shoky> huh
[07:46:11] <EdwardIII> ah wait, it doesn't work heh
[07:46:40] <EdwardIII> well, the opacity bit works, but it makes all the sub-lis position: absolute which = pain, 1 sec
[07:47:28] <natrixnatrix89> Is it possible to get send an ajax request to another domain, and get JSON response and use this data?
[07:47:44] <johnkpaul> natrixnatrix89: do you have control of the other domain?
[07:47:57] <natrixnatrix89> yes
[07:48:00] <johnkpaul> then yes
[07:48:06] <johnkpaul> you can either use jsonp, or cross origin resource sharing
[07:48:11] <johnkpaul> ?g what is jsonp @ natrixnatrix89
[07:48:12] <bot-t> natrixnatrix89, What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/
[07:48:18] <ezioa> anyone know if datatables allows you to pass in a dataset and it will update the table automatically?
[07:48:20] <johnkpaul> ?g cross origin resource sharing @ natrixnatrix89
[07:48:21] <bot-t> natrixnatrix89, Cross-origin resource sharing - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing
[07:48:22] <EdwardIII> shoky: does this make sense to you?
[07:48:24] <natrixnatrix89> yes. I tried jsonp.. but ihow to use it?
[07:48:26] <EdwardIII> http://jsfiddle.net/4cN86/11/
[07:48:40] <johnkpaul> natrixnatrix89: did you read that post?
[07:48:54] <natrixnatrix89> oh ..the post..
[07:49:05] <natrixnatrix89> but the cross origin resource..
[07:49:13] <natrixnatrix89> all I have to do is add a header to make it work?
[07:49:44] <johnkpaul> as long as you don't care about <ie8, pretty much
[07:49:47] <natrixnatrix89> but I guess Cross-origin resource sharing is less supported than JSONP right?
[07:50:06] <natrixnatrix89> ok. I'll try adding the header..
[07:50:08] <Jagan> How to create loading using jquery? can anyone help me?
[07:50:14] <natrixnatrix89> if it doesn't work, I'll try the JSONP
[07:50:24] <johnkpaul> natrixnatrix89: do you care about ie 6 and 7?
[07:50:38] <natrixnatrix89> Well. not really
[07:50:41] <lathan> Jagan, what do you mean by 'loading'
[07:51:11] <EdwardIII> shoky: seems to work. how come everything needs to be on the li for this to work in IE8? works fine everywhere else
[07:51:19] <johnkpaul> natrixnatrix89: ok, then it's just opera if you care about that
[07:51:26] <johnkpaul> you can find the list on that wikipedia article
[07:52:15] <lathan> jagan, please stay on the main channel
[07:52:30] <johnkpaul> haha
[07:52:38] <Jagan> ok lathan
[07:52:46] <shoky> EdwardIII: dono i dont ask questions about IE
[07:57:49] <natrixnatrix89> wow.. CORS really made it work..
[07:57:49] <natrixnatrix89> thanks johnkpaul!
[07:57:55] <natrixnatrix89> and painless
[07:58:09] <EdwardIII> shoky: heh
[07:58:28] <johnkpaul> :) no problem natrixnatrix89

[07:58:50] <shoky> np, already had it for you yesterday ;p

[08:05:07] <Mac_Weber> johnkpaul: now the plugin is loaded, v1.2.1, jquery v.1.4.4, but under  IE I'm still getting undefined for newURL

[08:05:49] <webchaos> ok. 1 min
[08:06:39] <johnkpaul> Mac_Weber: are you sure that the hashchange plugin is there
[08:06:48] <lathan> ?hi
[08:06:48] <bot-t> lathan, :)
[08:07:14] <johnkpaul> Mac_Weber: check if jQuery.fn.hashchange is not undefined

[08:07:22] <bot-t> Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[08:07:24] <Mac_Weber> johnkpaul: I see its .js on the list of loaded files
[08:08:39] <Mac_Weber> johnkpaul: undefined =/
[08:08:52] <johnkpaul> Mac_Weber: ok, so you don't have the hashchange plugin

[08:11:05] <yi_> hi guys.. I'm working on a project that let's user's select a jquery-ui style sheet using the themeswitcher.. I had 2 questions.. 1) how do you get the url of the jquery ui style sheet after one is selected. 2) Is it ok to link to the jquery-ui site to retrieve the stylesheet?
[08:11:18] <smykes> Does anyone know of a reliable way to rotate things in IE without their terrible filter implementation?
[08:11:31] <tplaner_> johnkpaul: I've done that locally, but the errors all spawn within jquery

[08:12:22] <lathan> yi_, 2) you probably should try google's code api
[08:12:26] <Mac_Weber> johnkpaul:  I don't see jQuery.fn.hashchange on the documentation, but    jQuery.bbq.getState  is NOT undefined
[08:12:56] <johnkpaul> tplaner_: in the unminified version, what is it trying to do, is there really no update method?
[08:13:04] <johnkpaul> Mac_Weber: ok, so add that hashchange plugin
[08:13:16] <EdwardIII> -!- Irssi: Join to #jquery was synced in 108 secs
[08:13:21] <EdwardIII> pure awesome heh
[08:13:31] <yi_> lathan: thanks I was considering this as well.. does google list all the stylesheets they have available somewhere?
[08:14:08] <lathan> yi_, stylesheets? or js? I'm not really familiar with that
[08:14:23] <yi_> lathan: stylesheets
[08:14:55] <tplaner_> johnkpaul: in the unminified version the line looks like this: this.options.placeholder.update(this.currentContainer, this.placeholder); and the "this.placeholder" variable is "undefined"
[08:15:15] <tplaner_> johnkpaul: I believe it has something to do with dynamically setting up the sorts through the hover method
[08:15:54] <johnkpaul> tplaner_: you have no element with the selector placeholder
[08:16:18] <johnkpaul> hm, I don't know how placeholder is supposed to be used
[08:16:25] <tplaner_> johnkpaul: that element is generated by "sortable"
[08:16:50] <lathan> it seems to be acting as the class to put on the placeholder element
[08:17:07] <lathan> tplaner_, why in the world are you instantiating the sortable on hover?
[08:17:41] <tplaner_> lathan: because I have dozens of elements on the page which require sortable, and setting them up on page load is obscenely slow
[08:18:26] <lathan> tplaner_, well, make sure you don't re-sortable them

[08:18:31] <Mac_Weber> johnkpaul: as the jQuery.bbq.getState  is defined, doesn't it mean that the plugin is already added?
[08:18:40] <lathan> tplaner_, with that large page...it probably won't work, but that works
[08:18:59] <tplaner_> ah, thats probably the issue actually
[08:19:01] <tplaner_> genius
[08:19:16] <johnkpaul> Mac_Weber: bbq is, yes, but not the haschange event
[08:19:18] <tplaner_> i'm re-sortable'ing them, which is clearing the placeholder
[08:19:20] <johnkpaul> I sent you the link for that
[08:20:19] <Mac_Weber> johnkpaul: gotcha. I alredy have it like this http://pastebin.com/DeG048xn
[08:23:27] <tplaner_> lathan / johnkpaul: http://jsfiddle.net/KbduW/2/ -- thank you very much you helped me find a solution -- really appreciate it
[08:27:58] <Naatan> hi, can anyone tell me if there is a stable successor to jquery-tmpl ?
[08:29:59] <johnkpaul> Naatan: there is not one, none suppoerted by jquery, but there are many options
[08:30:00] <johnkpaul> http://garann.github.com/template-chooser/
[08:30:35] <Naatan> thanks, yeah I did find some non-jquery solutions.. wasn't sure if they were any good
[08:31:01] <Naatan> I'm liking how Mustache.js works, might just wrap jquery around that

[08:43:22] <antihero> Hello, I'm using jquery to scrollTo my page's old scrollto after updating a div that changes dimensions for a split second. This works great on Firefox, but on webkit it doesn't redraw the page until I click somewhere which is bloody weird.
[08:43:34] <DeltaHeavy> I have an animate function sliding a menu at the time time it's populated depending on a previous selection. When I go back then click on another button which switches the menu back to the dynamic menu, it doesn't populate. This is in JS/jQuery. Anybody know how to fix something like this?

[08:45:34] <bot-t> DeltaHeavy, Please create a working demo of your problem on jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net. Please include the JS and CSS dependencies so we can see what you're talking about. Note: the script panes do not need script tags, or $(document).ready's, that is automatic
[08:46:24] <BigWings> can someone tell me what I have to do to make the blue 'content' div fit properly inside the black 'window' div?
[08:46:26] <BigWings> http://aeonvirtual.com/Imagine/test.php
[08:46:56] <BigWings> i have a fixed height header and I can't get the content to not overflow the window now
[08:47:30] <DeltaHeavy> lathan: It's too much to create a working demo of. Would be faster to just figure it out myself
[08:47:56] <lathan> DeltaHeavy, any public access to your page?
[08:48:02] <johnkpaul> BigWings: overflow:hidden
[08:48:18] <johnkpaul> oh div class="window"
[08:48:20] <DeltaHeavy> lathan: Nope, can't share the whole thing anyway
[08:48:44] <DeltaHeavy> I think I need a sleep or something somewhere but it's not really helping. Have you ever run into anything like this before?
[08:49:07] <BigWings> johnkpaul: yeah but then my content window is still not the right size
[08:49:21] <Archer_xda> BigWings : If you have fixed height container and header, can you not just have fixed height content as well?
[08:49:37] <BigWings> no, its for a window system
[08:49:46] <EdwardIII> hrm, has this been hacked? http://www.javelinjs.com/
[08:49:47] <BigWings> the header is fixed height, but the content can scale
[08:49:48] <johnkpaul> BigWings: oh, you want it to take the rest of the available space?
[08:49:56] <BigWings> exactly
[08:50:00] <johnkpaul> BigWings: you should ask #css, they would have a faster answer
[08:50:07] <lathan> DeltaHeavy, I don't have enough information to help....
[08:50:08] <BigWings> ok
[08:50:21] <johnkpaul> I sadly have lost touch with a lot of my css roots, but I believe there is a way

[08:50:44] <lathan> float: left @ BigWings
[08:50:49] <BigWings> it all seems very complicated
[08:50:59] <lathan> BigWings, if applied to both divs that works.....unless you hate float...it can bite you later...
[08:51:00] <DeltaHeavy> lathan: Thanks anyway
[08:51:05] <lathan> ?sorry @ DeltaHeavy

[08:51:07] <BigWings> would be nice to just be able to say 'height: 100%-20px;'
[08:51:14] <alexr2> is there any way to get the address of a website doing an ajax call? (cross-domain)?
[08:51:14] <lathan> oops
[08:51:22] <BigWings> i know there is eval but that is probably not standards compliant
[08:51:24] <lathan> BigWings, it would. but its not likely to happen
[08:51:30] <johnkpaul> alexr2: referrers?
[08:51:37] <lathan> BigWings, the other option is to javascript it....
[08:51:57] <johnkpaul> BigWings: http://www.alistapart.com/articles/holygrail
[08:51:57] <BigWings> yeah but i was hoping to do it with pure css
[08:52:13] <johnkpaul> you're asking for the equivalent of that, but for rows rather than columsn
[08:52:25] <thinkt4nk> and yet, you're asking in #jquery
[08:52:52] <Archer_xda> BigWings : You can't do it with pure CSS - it needs script
[08:53:07] <BigWings> johnkpaul: perhaps, i should take some time to read it
[08:53:20] <Archer_xda> BigWings : Run this in your console $(".window").each(function() { $(this).find(".content").height($(this).height() - $(this).find(".header").height()) });
[08:53:20] <lathan> Archer_xda, well...johnkpaul just showed it with CSS
[08:53:22] <BigWings> Archer_xda: it seems like such a simple thing
[08:53:39] <Archer_xda> lathan : Yeah, not what he's asking though.
[08:53:57] <lathan> wrong axis, but can be applied
[08:54:17] <lathan> just using padding top/bottom instead of padding left/right
[08:54:46] <BigWings> Archer_xda: that works, too bad its not just with css... how would I call this though so it always works?
[08:54:58] <lathan> BigWings, obviously, the easiest thing to do is to set a height of 80px on .header, but ....that's cheating
[08:55:42] <BigWings> i guess each time a new window gets made and each time one gets resized
[08:55:43] <Archer_xda> BigWings : It depends when you need it to run.  You could set it to run at document.ready, or if windows are added dynamically then also add it to the end of the function that adds them
[08:55:57] <Archer_xda> BigWings : Yes
[08:57:23] <lathan> $(document).bind('ready resize', function(){....}) @ BigWings, Archer_xda
[08:57:32] <lathan> oh...dynamically added windows
[08:58:43] <BigWings> would be cool if there was an online wysiwyg tool that allows you to build div structures on the fly
[08:59:47] <arnpro> why would $obj.height() be undefined if, $obj exists and it's a div, made sure by console.loggin right before the height()
[08:59:59] <mistenkt> Anyone here whos used Etch.js and has 5minutes to spare to help me with a couple of issues ?
[09:00:55] <lathan> arnpro, $obj could be an empty jquery collection, have you tried $obj.length ?
[09:01:13] <lathan> or $obj.get()
[09:01:35] <arnpro> lathan: it says it, plus it shows on the chrome console, when I logged it...
[09:01:40] <arnpro> it says 1*
[09:01:56] <lathan> arnpro, check $obj.parent()
[09:02:12] <lathan> $obj could be a div that has no parent, and has been seperated from the DOM
[09:02:15] <Archer_xda> arnpro : If it's a collection it could still show 1 as length.  How are you populating it?
[09:02:43] <arnpro> lathan: the parent shows aswell, it's another div
[09:02:52] <Archer_xda> scratch that then
[09:03:14] <Archer_xda> arnpro : do you have a url, or could you jsfiddle?
[09:03:48] <arnpro> ill fiddle it
[09:04:02] <BigWings> works with pure css now
[09:04:03] <BigWings> http://aeonvirtual.com/Imagine/test.php
[09:04:27] <ori-away> it it possible to use jquery to attach / trigger events on arbitrary JS objects (i.e. not just DOM nodes), like backbone.js?
[09:05:39] <thinkt4nk> ori-away it's possible to use JavaScript to do what you're describing
[09:05:45] <Archer_xda> BigWings : Nice.  Is it just position:absolute that makes that work?
[09:06:11] <ori-away> thinkt4nk: right, obviously. it seems conceptually easy but hard to nail down things like propagation exactly right.
[09:07:18] <thinkt4nk> the DOM, not jQuery, handles propagation, though
[09:07:32] <abhinav_singh> how do i get the 'id' of top frame in my facebook app?
[09:07:38] <thinkt4nk> so if you want to use an event emitter pattern with propagation, then you have to design and implement a propagation scheme
[09:07:41] <arnpro> Archer_xda: lathan: here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/arnpro/2ew7B/
[09:07:42] <BigWings> Archer_xda: it uses 'bottom' AND 'top' properties on the blue box
[09:08:06] <BigWings> i didn't know that you can set both of those together but aparently you can
[09:08:41] <ori_> thinkt4nk: right. i'm being silly. this sounds like a fun project actually. i guess i just wanted to make sure i wasn't reproducing something that's already available on jquery
[09:08:52] <ori_> thinkt4nk: thanks
[09:09:01] <thinkt4nk> ori_ np :P
[09:10:05] <Jagan> how to do wating or loading, till get response using Jquery?
[09:10:22] <Archer_xda> BigWings : I didn't know that myself, but it makes sense.
[09:10:57] <arnpro> oh Archer_xda and lathan think I found it, idiot me! missed an )
[09:13:03] <Archer_xda> arnpro : There was a ) in the wrong place, but there's a different error on jsfiddle
[09:13:10] <lathan> ori_, thinkt4nk JavaScript may let you do that....but jQuery makes it alot easier for events on objects
[09:13:38] <SmashingX> I need to know some part of code in jquery that when I select a checkbox it selects a radiobutton depending on what checkbox I select, can anybody help me on this?
[09:13:42] <lathan> abhinav_singh, $(top).attr('id') ?
[09:13:51] <thinkt4nk> lathan: a lot? it's a very simple pattern
[09:15:05] <arnpro> Archer_xda: where did you see it?
[09:15:20] <lathan> Jagan, async: false
[09:15:39] <lathan> ?checkbox @ SmashingX
[09:15:39] <bot-t> SmashingX, :checkbox: Selects all elements of type checkbox. http://api.jquery.com/checkbox-selector/
[09:15:43] <lathan> ?checkboxes
[09:15:43] <bot-t> As of jQuery 1.6, use .prop("checked") to test checked, and .prop("checked", true or false) to change the state. In jQuery 1.5 you could check the box with .attr("checked","checked") and to uncheck it, do .removeAttr("checked")
[09:17:13] <Archer_xda> arnpro: Weird.  When you fix the console.log line that gets the height, you get an error in actions.js - Object #<Object> has no method 'getParent'
[09:17:25] <lathan> SmashingX, $(':checkbox').click(function(){ $('input:radio[name=' + this.name + ']').attr('checked','checked'); });
[09:18:59] <SmashingX> does that work dinamicaly? I mean after the page is load and everything?
[09:19:21] <Archer_xda> arnpro: There's something strange going on.  This exact script caused the error I gave above, but when I updated it it started to work fine, including getting the height... http://jsfiddle.net/2ew7B/2/
[09:19:24] <SmashingX> because if the checkbutton is unchecked I have to make that it selects another radiobutton
[09:19:35] <lathan> thinkt4nk, jQuery let's you do event classes, it standardises event objects.....
[09:19:50] <thinkt4nk> lathan: good point, that _is_ true
[09:19:51] <lathan> thinkt4nk, it may not be more less typing, but its a standard framework for events....
[09:20:03] <lathan> *less typing
[09:20:09] <thinkt4nk> yep
[09:20:20] <lathan> ?live @ SmashingX
[09:20:21] <bot-t> SmashingX, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[09:21:19] <silverwind> live is dead!
[09:21:27] <silverwind> use .on :P
[09:22:30] <lathan> ?on @ lathan
[09:22:30] <bot-t> lathan, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/

[09:29:33] <bartmax> anyone knows why jslint throws unexpected >> in this line: if (((result & parseInt('0100', 2)) >> 2)) { ... }
[09:30:21] <thinkt4nk> bartmax are you meaning to use bitwise and?
[09:30:34] <bartmax> yes
[09:31:13] <thinkt4nk> ah, obviously :P
[09:31:18] <bartmax> i do lot of bitwise operations and jslint scream for all of em
[09:31:19] <bartmax> ;)
[09:31:28] <thinkt4nk> didn't see the right shift at first
[09:35:44] <whitson> This: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3039748/jslint-reports-unexpected-use-of-and-id-like-to-clean-this suggests that JSLint just doesn't like bitwise operators
[09:36:42] <whitson> So perhaps putting /* jslint bitwise: false */ at the top of all your js files would be appropriate
[09:43:23] <arnpro> Archer_xda: in the same plguin http://jsfiddle.net/2ew7B/2/, how can I call the getItemCount method inside init()?
[09:44:54] <ElGoorf> hi
[09:45:04] <ElGoorf> i'm trying to get hold of the i18n files (for datepicker)
[09:45:28] <ElGoorf> i found that http://jqueryui.com/ui/i18n has a load more files than the repo linked in the documentation
[09:45:57] <ElGoorf> but.. no permission :( anyone know where I can get hold of each .js in a zip?
[09:46:06] <ElGoorf> rather than download eahc individually?
[09:48:22] <Archer_xda> arnpro: Just declare it outside the methods declaration... http://jsfiddle.net/2ew7B/5/
[09:48:27] <arnpro> ElGoorf: idk if it helps, but is it what you need? http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.10/i18n/jquery-ui-i18n.min.js
[09:48:47] <ElGoorf> anrpro, that doesn't have as many languages
[09:49:25] <ElGoorf> view-source:http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/localization.html   <-- you'll see theres way more available
[09:50:06] <arnpro> there we go ElGoorf http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ui/i18n/
[09:50:24] <arnpro> Archer_xda: if I do that, then I'll be able to call that method from outside?
[09:50:25] <ElGoorf> ooooooooo
[09:50:25] <ElGoorf> ty
[09:53:11] <Archer_xda> arnpro : Yes, you would, but only within the first (function($) { ... })(jQuery) block
[09:54:30] <bartmax> thinkt4nk: so? .. :d
[09:54:38] <bartmax> anyidea why jslint didnt like it ?
[09:55:14] <taar779> hello, is there a way for a plugin to know the selector its being called on? I understand there is $(this) but I want the plugin to loop through all elements with that selector not just that single element
[09:55:19] <thinkt4nk> bartmax: I think whitson answered already
[09:55:52] <bartmax> thinkt4nk: my god, didn't see. sorry aand thanks
[09:55:53] <thinkt4nk> taar779: $(this).each(function() { ? } );
[09:55:57] <thinkt4nk> lol, np :)
[09:58:24] <taar779> thinkt4nk, I tried that and it didn't work. Here is the code http://jsfiddle.net/taar779/tucT4/
[09:58:58] <taar779> thinkt4nk, updated: http://jsfiddle.net/taar779/tucT4/2/
[09:59:20] <thinkt4nk> the argument that you're naming selector is actually the options for the plugin
[09:59:23] <imsky> hey hey hey
[09:59:49] <thinkt4nk> in the context of the plugin method, 'this' points to the jQuery wrapped set of elements
[10:00:01] <thinkt4nk> so use $(this).each instead of $(selector).each
[10:00:41] <thinkt4nk> taar779: http://jsfiddle.net/tucT4/3/
[10:02:08] <thinkt4nk> and to illustrate the use of options, see http://jsfiddle.net/tucT4/5/
[10:02:31] <taar779> thinkt4nk, I don't understand, it still doesn't do what I would like.
[10:03:13] <thinkt4nk> well maybe you have another issue, then.  What is the desired effect?
[10:05:32] <thinkt4nk> btw, your selector is wrong
[10:05:46] <bartmax> how am I supposed to use 'unsafe' characters as áéíóú in javascript ? &aacute; doesn't work.
[10:05:54] <thinkt4nk> http://jsfiddle.net/tucT4/7/
[10:08:05] <taar779> thinkt4nk, could you explain the context of 'this'?
[10:08:47] <thinkt4nk> this, in the context of the plugin method, is the jQuery wrapped set of elements
[10:09:51] <thinkt4nk> does that make sense?
[10:10:29] <taar779> thinkt4nk, so 'this' is each of the percent_bar elements on the page?
[10:10:40] <thinkt4nk> it's an anonymous function that is called on the jQuery wrapped set, so the context belongs to the set
[10:10:53] <thinkt4nk> close, 'this' is all of hte percent_bar elements
[10:11:31] <thinkt4nk> so if you want to iterate through the set, you need to use this.each
[10:11:52] <taar779> thinkt4nk, makes sense now. I never saw that in the jquery docs. I'll have another look and thank you very much for your help.
[10:13:12] <thinkt4nk> no problem!  Yeah, beware any examples that always call the plugin on a single element, since they don't expose the fact that the context of the plugin method is a jQuery set
[10:13:30] <mysphyt> Hey, folks. I'm doing something weird. I've got an absolutely positioned element (#bottom) at the bottom of a scrolling div (#wrapper). I want to insert content (#content) into the div *above* #bottom *without* having the div scroll up to see it. Right now, when #content pops in, the content of #wrapper changes in height, and so #bottom scrolls out of view. #wrapper.scrollTop gets me back down, but I'm wanting to essentially lock #wrap
[10:13:30] <mysphyt>  scrolling to the bottom during the animation. Is this achievable?
[10:15:44] <DeltaHeavy> Is there anyway I can easily pass categories[i] into the function for the complete function of .animate()?  $('#' + categories[i]).animate({height:0}, function() { $('#' + categories[i]).css('display', 'none'); alert(categories[i]); });
[10:16:14] <thinkt4nk> mysphyt: can you use position fixed instead?
[10:17:33] <mysphyt> thinkt4nk: No, because after the animation, the user needs to be able to scroll #bottom out of the viewport.
[10:17:46] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: var c = categories[i]; $('#' + c).animate({height:0}, function() { $('#' + c).css('display', 'none'); alert(c); });
[10:19:57] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: How is just putting it in another variable fix it?
[10:20:02] <DeltaHeavy> Cause it's not working for me
[10:20:59] <shoky> then you got something else wrong
[10:21:12] <thinkt4nk> DeltaHeavy show us some code
[10:21:31] <DeltaHeavy> var x = categories[i]; $('#' + categories[i]).animate({height:0}, function() { $('#' + x).css('display', 'none'); alert(x); });
[10:21:38] <thinkt4nk> lol not here
[10:21:59] <thinkt4nk> jsfiddle?
[10:22:03] <shoky> also you don't need the $('#' + x) inside the callback
[10:22:11] <shoky> $(this) is enough
[10:22:17] <DeltaHeavy> thinkt4nk: Too complicated
[10:22:24] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: That might be all I need lemme check
[10:22:57] <shoky> won't help for the alert tho.. you can just get this.id tho
[10:23:01] <shoky> THO.
[10:25:06] <thinkt4nk> I'm guessing the value of x is changing in a control structure, so the closure scope loses the reference to the x value that you expect
[10:25:46] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah it's working thanks
[10:25:48] <thinkt4nk> using $(this) in the callback should do it, though

[10:29:12] <SmashingX> I want to be able to chek any checkbox and that the radiobutton to change the selection to $0 If I don't select any checkbox it would automatically select the radiobutton with the $0 option like described here: http://jsfiddle.net/U6e5v/11/
[10:29:21] <SmashingX> is it possible to do it with jqeury?
[10:29:24] <SmashingX> jquery
[10:30:15] <shoky> there's nothing described there
[10:31:13] <shoky> SmashingX: yes
[10:31:26] <SmashingX> nothing described?
[10:31:35] <SmashingX> there are cheboxes and radiobuttons there
[10:31:40] <SmashingX> do you see them?
[10:31:44] <shoky> yup
[10:33:07] <shoky> it seems like it's doing what you said you want
[10:33:11] <shoky> that is, nothing
[10:39:54] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/zSA8k/3/ can anyone figure why this same exact code would work on jsfiddle but not another domain?
[10:42:49] <SmashingX> shoky: right now it doing nothing
[10:43:07] <SmashingX> shoky I just want to show how the textboxes are and the radiobuttons
[10:43:41] <SmashingX> It doesn't have any javascript code, so it's doing nothing
[10:44:15] <shoky> but that's also what you said you want
[10:44:17] <SmashingX> but I want to know how can I make the radiobuttons to be checked if I check the checkboxes
[10:44:22] <shoky> if you check any checkbox, select $0
[10:44:28] <shoky> if you dont select any checkbox, select $0
[10:44:33] <SmashingX> no
[10:44:40] <shoky> thats what you said ;)
[10:44:42] <SmashingX> If you don't select any, select 500
[10:44:51] <SmashingX> ops
[10:44:57] <SmashingX> you're right I just read it
[10:45:03] <SmashingX> sorry
[10:45:19] <shoky> ok this is doable with jquery, yes
[10:46:35] <SmashingX> could you give me any pointers?
[10:46:43] <Gachl> evening! how do I get the url of the failed ajax request in an ajax fail callback? I'm loading multiple things at the same time and I want to know which one has failed to load.
[10:46:45] <SmashingX> I don't have any idea how to do this
[10:46:54] <shoky> .click()  or .on()  to bind the click events on the checkboxes
[10:47:23] <shoky> and inside the click handler you can see if any are checked using the :checked selector
[10:47:24] <bartmax> shoky: i guess on should be better.
[10:47:40] <bartmax> shoky: also use change input instead of click
[10:47:49] <SmashingX> so before .click I write the name of the checkbox?
[10:47:56] <shoky> and then you can check or uncheck a radio button  with .prop('checked', true)
[10:48:00] <shoky> or false
[10:48:05] <bartmax> $('.checkbox').on('change input', function() { ... });
[10:48:10] <shoky> SmashingX: learn jquery
[10:48:20] <shoky> change input?
[10:48:28] <bartmax> shoky: yes.
[10:48:31] <ravenzz> ..
[10:48:34] <SmashingX> omg
[10:49:06] <bartmax> ? input
[10:49:06] <bot-t> :input: Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements. http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[10:49:10] <ravenzz> why would you add a .checkbox class to a checkbox element?
[10:49:11] <ravenzz> :D
[10:49:23] <SmashingX> by 'checkbox' it should have the name of the checkbox?
[10:49:26] <bartmax> ravenzz: it's an example selector. either way, why not ?
[10:49:30] <SmashingX> bartman?
[10:49:37] <bartmax> SmashingX: there's no tag for checkbox
[10:49:57] <bartmax> and input[type="checkbox"] it's quite inneficient.
[10:50:02] <ravenzz> bartmax $('input[type="checkbox"]')
[10:50:02] <ravenzz> ?
[10:50:05] <ravenzz> k
[10:50:07] <bartmax> dont'be a smartass SmashingX
[10:50:15] <SmashingX> ? what?
[10:50:16] <bot-t> SmashingX, jQuery: The Write Less, Do More, JavaScript Library - http://jquery.com/
[10:50:22] <ravenzz> ?what
[10:50:22] <bot-t> your name
[10:50:26] <ravenzz> nice
[10:50:49] <SmashingX> smartass? I'm trying to see how to solve my problem
[10:50:58] <SmashingX> unless you give me the answer haha
[10:52:05] <Gachl> can anyone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/t6gBH/ I'd like to show the url of the failed script instead of "???"
[10:52:54] <Gachl> the problem is that the script source is loaded from an array so I don't have the script source myself anywhere
[10:53:23] <bartmax> shoky: input event is wrong. checkbox doesn't need/have input event. --> more info on input: http://help.dottoro.com/ljhxklln.php
[10:54:55] <varnie> suppose I have have some selected items; how do I perform additional search within them by their data-attribue? smth like var items = $('div'); $foo = $(items).find("[data-rate=5]"); // ?
[10:55:20] <ravenzz> ?filter @ varnie
[10:55:21] <bot-t> varnie, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[10:55:41] <shoky> SmashingX: here's an example http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/U6e5v/13/
[10:55:49] <varnie> thanks, ravenzz!
[10:55:56] <varnie> it is exactly what I need.
[10:55:58] <ravenzz> do you want to filter them or looking for children which match some attribute?
[10:56:10] <varnie> second.
[10:56:25] <innociv> http://pastebin.com/fKWypnaA I don't understand this error.  postMessage is supposed to work cross domain.
[10:56:34] <bartmax> Gachl: http://jsfiddle.net/t6gBH/1/
[10:56:53] <varnie> I want to get them out of that array if there're any which satisfy the conditions.
[10:57:10] <Gachl> duh :D, thanks bartmax, that was easy!
[10:59:05] <bartmax> ;)
[10:59:44] <SmashingX> shoky: thanks man, that's what I wanted exactly!
[11:00:42] <SmashingX> shoky: but is the other way around, so Im trying to figure out how to make checked unchecked
[11:01:22] <shoky> you can just add ! to the condition
[11:02:44] <SmashingX> shoky: I fixed it http://jsfiddle.net/U6e5v/16/
[11:02:53] <SmashingX> by changing the names of the radiobutton
[11:04:02] <innociv> Oh I figured it out..
[11:04:27] <bartmax> SmashingX: lol,.. doesnt work on first run :)
[11:04:43] <bartmax> innociv: what was the prob ?
[11:04:57] <SmashingX> bartmax: I guess I have to put the default as $500 right?
[11:05:04] <bartmax> yea
[11:05:11] <SmashingX> since all the checkboxes are unchecked
[11:05:14] <innociv> postMessage() second argument needs to be the iframe src domain, not the domain you are calling from
[11:05:32] <innociv> I don't quite understand why that argument even exists since it can only be one thing...
[11:05:59] <jrockjiggz> hi i'm trying to window.location(url) but am getting Uncaught TypeError: Property 'location' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function
[11:06:08] <bartmax> innociv: no idea. but interesting to know
[11:06:25] <SmashingX> bartmax: http://jsfiddle.net/U6e5v/17/
[11:06:54] <SmashingX> better?
[11:07:00] <bartmax> yea
[11:07:23] <SmashingX> can I ask you things about your code?
[11:07:24] <bartmax> jrockjiggz: bad usage
[11:07:27] <bartmax> jrockjiggz: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.location
[11:07:41] <bartmax> ? ask
[11:07:41] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:07:47] <jrockjiggz> lol. thanks bartmax
[11:08:06] <SmashingX> I know but those are questions for the channel. I was asking you about the code
[11:08:14] <bartmax> then no you can't.
[11:08:18] <innociv> I have another question. Say I have "foo.bar.example.org"  "www.example.org" and I want to just get "example.org" from those?  doing split(".", string), checking length to get to the end of the split, and readding the period is a bit messy.
[11:08:18] <SmashingX> :(
[11:08:32] <SmashingX> whatever.. thanks anyway
[11:08:35] <innociv> But I can do it that way if that makes the most sense
[11:09:46] <SmashingX> I was just wondering what would happen if I have more checkboxes on the page and I want only those to be affecteed
[11:09:56] <bartmax> innociv: parsin url is kinda tricky... and yes, messy... i dont know of a url parse BUT must be a plugin for that :)
[11:10:13] <bartmax> search for hash navigation, query location, location itself... maybe you got lucky.
[11:10:18] <innociv> Well it's event.origin on this function so it's just a hostname, which simplifies it a ibt
[11:10:32] <bartmax> SmashingX: you use a selector.
[11:10:45] <imachuchu> can jquery selectors use regex? I'm trying to clone a div and then change it's id (and all of the ids inside it), but all id's are generated by django (think "id_form-<uniqueNumber>-name"). Is regex the right way or is there an easier/better way?
[11:10:54] <bartmax> SmashingX: you can wrap the interesing one in a div and use ('div.onlythisones input')
[11:11:04] <SmashingX> ok I see
[11:11:11] <bartmax> or you class them as ('input.onlythischeckbox')
[11:11:17] <jonkri> if i have $(this), how can i get the "<a>" that is in $(this)?
[11:11:17] <SmashingX> what's function e?
[11:11:38] <SmashingX> I mean what's e in your function?
[11:11:59] <bartmax> jonkri: $(this)[0] or $(this).get(0) should work.
[11:12:20] <ajpiano> uhhhhhh
[11:12:23] <jonkri> bartmax: what if i want to do $('a')-type selections?
[11:12:29] <ajpiano> this === $(this)[0]
[11:12:47] <bartmax> ajpiano: you are the man! :D
[11:12:55] <ajpiano> i'm a man
[11:13:00] <bartmax> hahaha
[11:13:00] <ajpiano> :p
[11:13:48] <bartmax> jonkri: i think i dont get your q
[11:14:10] <bartmax> jonkri: got it! $(this).find('a');
[11:14:27] <jonkri> ah, thanks :) sorry for being unclear
[11:14:31] <bartmax> np
[11:14:47] <bartmax> english is not my native, so maybe it's my bad ... pretty sure it's my bad ;)
[11:16:30] <bartmax> ajpiano: do you know of any plugin for url parsing @innociv
[11:16:32] <arnpro> hey guys, how can I .find() the first visible element, after a certain index???
[11:17:01] <innociv> I know of one already.  It's just too complex for a tiny task
[11:17:11] <ajpiano> bartmax: innociv document.createElement("a") is an awesome url parser
[11:17:13] <innociv> $.url() is quite nice.  But it's bloat for this little thing
[11:17:41] <ajpiano> innociv: if you create a new anchor element and then look at it's properties, it should the same as a window.location and any other anchor
[11:17:41] <bartmax> arnpro: next(5).first(':visible'); think should work.
[11:17:45] <ajpiano> so you'll have hash query etc etc
[11:18:17] <innociv> var hostarray = ev.origin.split(".");  var hostlen = hostarray.length;  var domain = hostarray[(hostlen-2)]+"."+hostarray[hostlen-1];
[11:18:39] <SmashingX> bartmax:  when I inserted the code you did into my code it didn't do anything but I inserted the code in a block of javascript code I was wondering if I have to specify that this block of code is jquery
[11:18:48] <bartmax> ajpiano: nice to know. still don't know if that will work for innociv since he needs to cut the subdomains from a main domain.
[11:18:58] <innociv> The question was to simply get the last part of a hostname.  To always get example.org from http://foo.example.org or http://one.long.string.of.subs.example.org
[11:19:11] <innociv> Anyway I solved it already. It just looked silly to me.
[11:19:12] <bartmax> SmashingX: i did you no code, was an example
[11:19:30] <SmashingX> bartmax: I know
[11:20:00] <SmashingX> bartmax: But I was wondering if I have to specify that is jquery code because my browser doesn't recognize it
[11:20:14] <ajpiano> var a = document.createElement("a"); a.href = "URLSTRING"; var subdomain = a.host.split(".").shift()
[11:20:15] <bartmax> SmashingX: err no...
[11:20:19] <ajpiano> innociv: ^^
[11:20:22] <SmashingX> bartmax: I have another line of code that says this: jQuery("#Main input:radio[id^=CIVICRM_QFID]:radio").attr('disabled', true);
[11:20:52] <SmashingX> bartmax: it starts with Jquery, so I was wondering if I have to specify that that chunk of code is jquery
[11:21:22] <bartmax> $ should be an alias for jQuery, if u use another plugin that might not be the case. try to change $ for jQuery
[11:21:27] <innociv> that makes "http://foo", ajpiano
[11:22:14] <ajpiano> it didn't for me
[11:22:20] <ajpiano> what browser
[11:22:35] <innociv> chrome
[11:22:35] <bartmax> shift returns the first, not the last. it must return http://foo
[11:22:56] <innociv> I did "http://www.foo.example.org".split(".").shift(); and it gave me "http://www"
[11:23:20] <bartmax> try pop instead of shift
[11:23:32] <ajpiano> innociv: http://cl.ly/3A0d1r07031q3S3j1r3b
[11:23:34] <ajpiano> i thought he wanted the first
[11:23:56] <innociv> that's org.  No I said I want the "example.org".  I guess the way I did it is what I should stick with.  It's not big deal now, I was just curious.
[11:25:28] <bartmax> innociv: it's basically the same, because u end up parsing a string of "http://www.foo.example.org" ... and that could be tricky
[11:25:58] <ajpiano> innociv: bartmax a.host.split(".").slice(-2).join(".")
[11:26:18] <ajpiano> ?eval var a = document.createElement("a"); a.href = "http://www.foo.manhattanairport.org/?page_id=1116"; var subdomain = a.host.split(".").slice(-2).join("."); subdomain;
[11:26:19] <bot-t> ajpiano: ReferenceError: document is not defined
[11:26:24] <ajpiano> ?jseval var a = document.createElement("a"); a.href = "http://www.foo.manhattanairport.org/?page_id=1116"; var subdomain = a.host.split(".").slice(-2).join("."); subdomain;
[11:26:25] <bot-t> ajpiano: ReferenceError: document is not defined
[11:26:27] <ajpiano> damnit
[11:26:31] <ajpiano> that used to work
[11:26:52] <bartmax> ajpiano: that works for .com only domains, yes.
[11:26:59] <innociv> It works.
[11:27:00] <ajpiano> why would it work only for .com
[11:27:03] <bartmax> put a .es or a .com.uy and forget it :)
[11:27:04] <innociv> ?eval "http://www.foo.example.org".split(".").slice(-2).join(".")
[11:27:05] <bot-t> innociv: "example.org"
[11:27:09] <ajpiano> bartmax: ohh you mean like that
[11:27:21] <bartmax> yup
[11:28:04] <innociv> bartmax, good point.  I don't use any of those domains but it could be a problem for anyone else wanting to use this.
[11:28:08] <bartmax> i think a parser should have the ending TLD or something like that... quite complex in my opinion. also ip address domain style-like are more confusing already.
[11:28:39] <johnkpaul> bartmax: your nick is making me listen to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn6iFw-TkVM
[11:28:50] <bartmax> lol!
[11:29:08] <bartmax> im doing the dance right now :D
[11:29:27] <johnkpaul> damn you :)
[11:30:24] <bartmax> innociv: benefits of linving in a com.uy country :)
[11:30:37] <innociv> ?
[11:30:46] <bartmax> im from Uruguay (South America)
[11:30:55] <innociv> What benefits?
[11:31:04] <bartmax> know that domain parsers are a pain in the a$$ :D
[11:31:08] <innociv> Ah
[11:31:27] <innociv> Not difficult if you have an array of all TLDs.
[11:32:17] <lathan> innociv, I think that qualifies as being difficult as well.....
[11:32:22] <johnkpaul> will url.js not handle all of this logic? innociv, and bartmax
[11:32:33] <johnkpaul> http://medialize.github.com/URI.js/
[11:32:34] <bartmax> johnkpaul: pretty sure theres a plugin yes :D
[11:32:48] <innociv> johnkpaul, it's more bloat than I need for this simple thing
[11:32:56] <lathan> bartmax, is this something that you don't have server side access? (the server knows what domain / subdomain it is running)
[11:33:54] <bartmax> johnkpaul: and actually, amazingly it does not have domain/subdomain parsing :)
[11:34:23] <johnkpaul> oh ok, makes sense not to use it then
[11:35:08] <bartmax> lathan: dunno innociv is the one who asked. but he actually resolved the issue years ago ... dunno why we still try to get an answer. i think there's no GOOD answer.
[11:35:14] <bartmax> or no SIMPLE answer.
[11:35:24] <johnkpaul> wow, uri.js is gigantic
[11:35:30] <lathan> oops.....
[11:35:31] <innociv> Well you guys are trying to answer a much more complicated question for funsies.
[11:36:11] <johnkpaul> I'm very surprised, but it has a list to figure out all valid tlds
[11:36:33] <innociv> Though I think a simple way to make this work for .com.uy would be if( splitdomain[domainlength-2] == "com" ) // slice again as -3
[11:36:39] <johnkpaul> bartmax: Do you know if co.uk is considered a tld in and of itself?
[11:36:41] <bartmax> johnkpaul: would be easier with url to do a host, strip the tld, split the remaining with ., get the last index, and insert the tld back!
[11:36:45] <innociv> All the TLD that are two parts are .com.foo right?
[11:36:49] <bartmax> co.uk it's a TLD
[11:36:56] <bartmax> innociv: no
[11:37:01] <innociv> Or co.
[11:37:06] <lathan> innociv, there's no convention
[11:37:15] <innociv> ah. Well it'd cover most of them.
[11:37:19] <bartmax> innociv: com.uy, co.uk, and the rest are only one part.
[11:37:19] <lathan> innociv, its whatever the major hosting sites sell
[11:37:29] <bartmax> innociv: i know what you are trying to do and it's OK! go for it :D
[11:38:18] <innociv> Right now, this is my own internal thing. I just have a site with lots of different sub domains and want to allow any from the main domain.  For others, yeah it could cause problems if they have a TLD that is split
[11:38:51] <lathan> innociv, if you know what the subdomain and main domain then you can do something
[11:39:07] <innociv>  i already didi t. "var domain = ev.origin.split(".").slice(-2).join(".");"
[11:39:07] <lathan> innociv, if you know the domain is *.about.*
[11:39:24] <lathan> innociv, then do /^(.*?)\.about\.(.*?)$/
[11:39:30] <innociv> if( domain == "example.com" )
[11:39:52] <innociv> Solved ages ago.  It's just people were discussing just generally after that
[11:39:55] <lathan> if you know the middle part but not the subdomain or the TLD....
[11:39:56] <lathan> ah
[11:40:06] <lathan> @curiosity, what did you do?
[11:40:08] <bartmax> innociv: all your fault! :D
[11:40:11] <lathan> ?lol

[11:48:30] <lathan> vargero, I'm guessing that your div doesn't exist when you try to bind the event to it
[11:48:39] <lathan> vargero, binding the event from the console works just fine
[11:48:49] <vargero> how should i do it?
[11:48:51] <Akuma> hello, I'm using the .ajax function and it's returning a response, however the response has both html and a javascript; the javascript part is not being embedded in the response
[11:48:57] <Akuma> any ideas why?
[11:48:59] <lathan> ?ready @ vargero
[11:48:59] <bot-t> vargero, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[11:49:06] <lathan> ?document ready @ vargero
[11:49:07] <vargero> lathan: place the script at the end of body tag?
[11:49:07] <bot-t> vargero, .ready() - Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[11:49:13] <rosieres> Has anybody a hint where to ask for video color issues in html5 video x264 ?
[11:49:23] <lathan> vargero, no, just put it inside a $(function(){.....})
[11:49:34] <lathan> vargero, or $(document).ready(function(){...})
[11:49:44] <vargero> thanks
[11:50:37] <lathan> vargero, oh, and by the way, your site is screaming with https warnings....all your google apis running as http make https pages think they aren't secure
[11:50:59] <lathan> Akuma, you using IE?
[11:51:26] <lathan> Akuma, wait...scripts are removed from html when its put in, but they are executed
[11:51:48] <vargero> lathan: i realize that ... the thing is, I shouldn't be putting this page there anyway, it was just a way to show the problem to you guys
[11:51:52] <vargero> thanks again!
[11:52:01] <lathan> ok
[11:52:37] <Akuma> lathan: is there any way around that? or that's just the way it is?
[11:52:53] <lathan> I think that's how jQuery does it @ Akuma
[11:53:09] <lathan> you could always do it w/out jQuery, but I think it is there to help
[11:53:23] <Akuma> that's too bad
[11:53:26] <lathan> $('<div />').get(0).innerHTML = newHTML;
[11:53:29] <lathan> Akuma, ^^
[11:53:30] <Akuma> thanks
[11:53:47] <lathan> Akuma, try that, but beware of IE and security issues with executing code
[11:54:33] <vargero> one more question ... does the jquery bind conflict somehow with the inline - <onmouseover=""> for example - event binding?
[11:54:35] <granden> could anyone help me a bit with my range-slider. I did copy paste the expample from jquery ui as that is pretty much what I want.
[11:54:40] <granden> but
[11:54:59] <granden> Insteod af displaying the valies like $75-$300 I want to put the min / max at each side of the slider
[11:55:13] <granden> http://a45.se/actesolutions/produktlista.html
[11:55:16] <granden> that is what I got right now
[11:56:31] <lathan> vargero, I do not think so, but I can't tell you which handler would run first
[11:56:52] <vargero> it's a different handler, that's the problem ;/
[11:57:03] <shoky> granden: what's the prob?
[11:57:27] <vargero> anyway, I've been researching jquery with the sole purpose of deleting this stuff, so it shouldn't be a problem
[11:58:30] <lathan> vargero, $('#div').bind('click', func_a); <div id="div" onclick="func_b()"></div>
[11:58:41] <lathan> vargero, that *should* run both functions, not sure which one would be first
[11:59:50] <lathan> vargero, okay...jQuery does clobber the inline: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/eVf5d/
[12:00:34] <gho5t> granden: you can access the values array as so - $( "#slider-range" ).slider( "option", "values" );
[12:01:14] <shoky> or just ui.values in the callbacks
[12:01:18] <shoky> as he's doing already
[12:02:09] <gho5t> yeah i see that now
[12:02:23] <sokie> hi room, i need to refresh three images in a page, each at a diffent interval. can jquery be of any use there?
[12:02:26] <gho5t> what is the problem indeed
[12:02:41] <shoky> sokie: yep
[12:02:55] <sokie> how can i do that?
[12:03:06] <shoky> setTimeout/setInterval
[12:03:36] <sokie> so native javascript?
[12:03:38] <gho5t> that's actual just js
[12:03:43] <shoky> well for the timeout yeah
[12:03:51] <shoky> what do you mean by refresh the images
[12:04:19] <sokie> one needs to be reloaded every 2sec. one every 15...
[12:04:30] <sokie> webcam images actually
[12:04:38] <gho5t> just use setInterval
[12:04:50] <shoky> better to use setTimeout
[12:04:59] <gehsekky> ^
[12:05:01] <shoky> and keep setting it at the end of the callback
[12:05:07] <gehsekky> and don't use a string as the first param
[12:05:09] <shoky> in case the response is slow
[12:05:19] <supsup> f-it use a setInterval that calls a function with a setTimeout
[12:05:34] <shoky> hm?
[12:05:39] <supsup> nm.
[12:05:43] <gho5t> jokes
[12:05:55] <shoky> oHhhHh
[12:08:22] <sokie> ok ty
[12:08:49] <shoky> and if you wanna refresh them
[12:08:55] <BarelyFitz> bugs.jquery.com appears to be down?
[12:09:10] <shoky> you should maybe add a random query parameter  like ?r=3902582906
[12:09:18] <shoky> or with the timestamp or whatever
[12:09:26] <sokie> yeah i knew that much, but thanks anyway
[12:09:50] <shoky> $('#imgId').attr('src','someurl')
[12:09:51] <sokie> im gonna add the timestamp, thats the best way i gues
[12:09:52] <sokie> s
[12:10:28] <granden> using jquery ui slider range. Is it possible to replace the knobs with two images?
[12:10:54] <shoky> granden: you can find the css class that the knobs uses
[12:10:55] <Leemp2> Question, with the event object (http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/), what would the best way to access the href of a link? this is the best i could really see, and it's big/ugly.. https://gist.github.com/165001f6f5c489d514c7
[12:11:03] <shoky> and override it in your own css
[12:11:26] <granden> shoky: Ok, how do I find the classname?
[12:11:31] <granden> so I know what to look for?
[12:11:33] <gho5t> yikes
[12:11:40] <[1]Lyfesaver> shoky, do u know C#?
[12:11:48] <shoky> [1]Lyfesaver: a bit
[12:11:51] <[1]Lyfesaver> http://paste2.org/p/2017318
[12:12:02] <[1]Lyfesaver> well this page I am loading
[12:12:14] <[1]Lyfesaver> it uses some inline razor C# syntax
[12:12:17] <sokie> in firefox you can now rightclick and inspect html elements
[12:12:28] <shoky> granden: uhh yea sokie just said it ;)
[12:12:33] <[1]Lyfesaver> as u can see everything is in a foreach loop
[12:12:52] <[1]Lyfesaver> well that loop might produce 700 results
[12:13:06] <granden> hmm, dont have firefox, have to download it then.
[12:13:09] <shoky> granden: also check the 'Theming' tab in the slider docs
[12:13:16] <shoky> granden: you can do that with chrome too
[12:13:28] <[1]Lyfesaver> and the making of those dialog divs inside the loop is causing some serious lag ans occasional script crash
[12:13:37] <shoky> granden: ui-slider-handle is probably what you're looking for
[12:13:43] <BarelyFitz> Using jquery 1.4.2, trying to submit a form like this $('#myform').submit() doesn't submit the form. comments on the docs page seem to indicate a bug if you have name="submit" or id="submit" on certain elements it might cause this problem. is anyone aware of a bug like this?
[12:13:50] <Lyfesaver> i am needing a way to pull that info on lick rather than have it built on load
[12:14:01] <gho5t> Lyfesaver: why not just use document.ready with and target the classnames
[12:14:15] <Lyfesaver> gho5t, i dont know JS
[12:14:18] <Lyfesaver> that is the problem
[12:14:20] <Lyfesaver> i am a dummy
[12:14:23] <Lyfesaver> strait up
[12:14:44] <gho5t> ah
[12:14:50] <gho5t> honesty. i like it
[12:14:50] <Lyfesaver> I know how to add or use a script, but i cant even read it to understand what it is doing
[12:14:55] <Lyfesaver> lol
[12:15:06] <shoky> Leemp2: $(event.target).attr('href')
[12:15:27] <Leemp2> shoky: Nice! Thanks :)
[12:17:09] <SmashingX> shoky, why your code doesn't work in last versions of jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/U6e5v/20/
[12:17:28] <shoky> that's last version?
[12:17:33] <BarelyFitz> bugs.jquery.com seems to be back up. thanks if somebody kicked it :-)
[12:18:04] <SmashingX> sorry I mean old versions
[12:18:18] <shoky> SmashingX: check your console
[12:18:29] <Lyfesaver> i have been struggling with this for 4 days
[12:18:33] <Lyfesaver> i am losing my mind
[12:18:47] <Lyfesaver> 4 days on one little script
[12:19:06] <SmashingX> shoky: I just changed the verion of Jquery and it stopped working
[12:19:11] <Lyfesaver> that should tell u how stupid i am when it comes to JS
[12:19:15] <shoky> SmashingX: check your console
[12:20:26] <SmashingX> it doesn't work with 1.6.4 http://jsfiddle.net/U6e5v/22/
[12:20:46] <shoky> for the third time
[12:20:47] <SmashingX> I don't have the lastest version of jquery
[12:20:47] <shoky> SmashingX: check your console
[12:21:08] <Leemp2> shoky: A side question i've had some trouble getting answered. Is it possible to "resume" an event? For example, say you catch an event `$('a').click()`, now you want to do some async stuff inside of the event.. you're going to want to pause the event while your async stuff executes.. but then later, when your async returns.. maybe you want to continue the event.. Any idea how this design would work with jQuery?
[12:21:43] <shoky> pause the event?
[12:21:47] <shoky> async?
[12:21:57] <shoky> what're you trying to do
[12:21:59] <lathan> Leemp2, what you are talking about is synchronous
[12:22:15] <lathan> Leemp2, if its an ajax, then do: { async: false, ...} in your config object
[12:22:28] <shoky> no don't ;\
[12:22:42] <lathan> I know
[12:22:47] <gho5t> Lyfesaver: I would put the values you need in data-attributes and iterate over each item in dom ready and create the widgets then
[12:22:50] <Leemp2> The `return true/false` or `event.preventDefault()` seems to be designed around a synchronous model.. ie, designed so that you know immediately know if you want to pause the event or not. What if you *don't* know, and instead need to find out later if you should call event.preventDefault()/etc
[12:23:08] <lathan> Leemp2, those run or cancel the event. there is no pause
[12:23:12] <shoky> then you're not talking about a single event
[12:23:25] <SmashingX> shoky: What do you mean by check your console? in the website?
[12:23:31] <shoky> SmashingX: see ?ftj
[12:23:32] <bot-t> SmashingX, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[12:23:36] <aitiba> hi
[12:23:51] <shoky> SmashingX: your browser's javascript console
[12:23:52] <aitiba> I have an error 500 on a $.post
[12:23:52] <Leemp2> Hmm
[12:24:03] <aitiba> this is my code http://pastebin.com/72mAAi3K
[12:24:04] <arnpro> SmashingX: console = firebug or chrome console
[12:24:08] <Leemp2> So, you're only option would be to cancel the event, and then later try to recreate the event?
[12:24:11] <SmashingX> ok
[12:24:12] <Leemp2> your*
[12:24:20] <shoky> how would we know your options
[12:24:54] <Leemp2> shoky: I dunno, i thought jQuery dom events were standardized
[12:25:17] <Leemp2> `event.preventDefault()`, etc
[12:25:21] <shoky> an event is just an object sent to a handler at some time
[12:25:32] <shoky> then its passed around to whoever wants to handle
[12:25:34] <shoky> in some order
[12:25:45] <shoky> one handler can stop the propagation
[12:25:48] <SmashingX> shoky: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'on'
[12:25:53] <shoky> there's no pausing an event
[12:25:56] <SmashingX> shoky: tha's what you mean?
[12:26:00] <shoky> SmashingX: yes
[12:26:37] <SmashingX> shoky: Ok, it works on the lastest version of jquery though
[12:26:45] <Leemp2> shoky: Well, yes there is.. right? I mean, as you put it, an event is just an object being passed around. If you stop the progress, you're pausing the event.. right? I'm guessing what i need to look at then, is how to generate an event again
[12:26:47] <shoky> yes, they have 'on'
[12:27:15] <shoky> Leemp2: that's not pausing the event. that's stopping its propagation. the event already happened
[12:27:26] <shoky> i click on a button
[12:27:33] <shoky> you're gonna pause my click?
[12:27:36] <shoky> no sir
[12:27:41] <Leemp2> shoky: Well you can stop it :s
[12:28:02] <Leemp2> shoky: Ok fine, so how do i recreate the event?
[12:28:11] <shoky> maybe you can undo stopPropagation somehow, no idea
[12:28:31] <arnpro> hey guys, I'm having trouble making a plugin, specifically with the variable scopes: http://pastebin.com/KkHTPCwh in the reattach() and goDown() functions, they both work with their own var, no matter if it changes in reattach(), goDown() keeps it's own value....
[12:28:41] <johnkpaul> Leemp2: sorry, I missed the beginning, what are you trying to do?
[12:28:46] <johnkpaul> you can recrete an event by triggering it
[12:28:46] <shoky> but you seem to have got wrong ideas about async development
[12:28:48] <johnkpaul> ?trigger @Leemp2
[12:28:49] <bot-t> Leemp2, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[12:28:56] <Leemp2> johnkpaul: Perfect :)
[12:29:08] <ironmagma> Is it possible to catch pinch-zoom events like jgestures does on a trackpad (e.g. on a laptop)? As it is those seem to be intercepted by a browser and used for page zoom.
[12:29:11] <SmashingX> shoky: I guess the console is talking about the method on you put on this line $(':checkbox').on(
[12:29:19] <shoky> SmashingX: indeed it is
[12:29:40] <johnkpaul> ironmagma: http://mwbrooks.github.com/thumbs.js/ might do that, but you should check me
[12:29:45] <shoky> SmashingX: you didnt say you wanted code that works in an old jquery version
[12:30:03] <arnpro> SmashingX: on() is new method in larest jQuery (1.7 or so), so if you want to reproduce it on older, you need to use live() I think or delegate()
[12:30:08] <SmashingX> even with the lastest version it shows that error
[12:30:21] <SmashingX> let me check that
[12:30:22] <shoky> huh :)
[12:30:48] <shoky> arnpro: he probably just wants .bind()
[12:30:48] <SmashingX> nevermind
[12:30:59] <SmashingX> It just shows a warning: Resource interpreted as Font but transferred with MIME type font/woff:
[12:31:05] <shoky> woff
[12:31:10] <ironmagma> johnkpaul: that doesn't seem to do pinch
[12:31:34] <SmashingX> does live works just as on arnpro?
[12:31:37] <shoky> no
[12:31:41] <johnkpaul> ironmagma: maybe ask #zepto
[12:31:45] <SmashingX> oh ok
[12:31:48] <arnpro> SmashingX: .bind() as shoky said
[12:31:53] <SmashingX> ok
[12:32:16] <Itrace_> Is this the correct way to write this: "... $(">div", element).addClass("cName"); ..." Could somebody point me to jQuery documentation on it? I don't understand this part of the code ">div"
[12:32:27] <shoky> me neither
[12:32:37] <shoky> oh there's a context
[12:32:46] <shoky> hm.
[12:33:16] <johnkpaul> Itrace_: what are you trying to do?
[12:33:32] <shoky> Note: The $("> elem", context) selector will be deprecated in a future release.
[12:33:36] <shoky> Its usage is thus discouraged in lieu of using alternative selectors.
[12:33:43] <arnpro> shoky: could you take a look at http://pastebin.com/KkHTPCwh and help me out with the variable scope problem?
[12:33:43] <shoky> from http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/
[12:34:02] <Itrace_> Thanks. I'm trying to decipher someone elses code.
[12:34:06] <SmashingX> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'prop'
[12:34:15] <SmashingX> is prop used only in the new version as well?
[12:34:18] <shoky> arnpro: what's the prob?
[12:34:23] <shoky> SmashingX: yes
[12:34:26] <SmashingX> damn
[12:34:34] <shoky> ah that's from 1.6 actually
[12:34:58] <shoky> you can use .attr('checked','checked')  instead of .prop('checked',true)
[12:35:02] <shoky> i think
[12:35:15] <SmashingX> ok let me try
[12:35:16] <SmashingX> thanks
[12:35:25] <arnpro> I declared var settings outside both functions, so when you click down, it does goDown(), but if you click #filter element, it should reattach() it, modifying the settings.item_index value, so in the next goDown() it starts from there, but it doesn't....
[12:35:26] <SmashingX> I think is checked true
[12:35:35] <SmashingX> anyway I will try
[12:36:00] <SmashingX> I have this .attr('disabled', true);
[12:36:12] <SmashingX> si I guess is 'checked' true
[12:36:28] <ericandrewlewis> if i make a post request, and have javascript within the post requests markup, does that javasript execute? or not, because js is client side?
[12:36:58] <shoky> arnpro: waat
[12:37:24] <SmashingX> nice
[12:37:26] <SmashingX> it worked!
[12:37:29] <arnpro> take a look at last lines, shoky
[12:37:51] <SmashingX> I was just wondering if that warning is going to be annoying
[12:37:55] <imachuchu> I have a div with multiple elements and I want to clone it and re-id everything inside it. Every id has a number in it where the number is shared per div (ex. "id_form-35-count", it's from django). What would be the best way?
[12:38:01] <SmashingX> Resource interpreted as Font but transferred with MIME type font/woff:
[12:38:11] <imachuchu> the "re-id" is to just change the number
[12:39:59] <shoky> arnpro: if you want data that's shared across method calls for the dom element, you can use .data()
[12:42:55] <shoky> s/shared across/preserved between/
[12:43:01] <arnpro> shoky: sorry Im a little lost, but I have not seen that much use of .data() in plugins... I thought they would share the same plugin instance when I first did $(obj).vSscroll(options); and then $(obj).vScroll('method');....
[12:43:29] <shoky> there's no plugin instance
[12:43:32] <shoky> it's just a function
[12:43:43] <shoky> with local variables
[12:44:55] <arnpro> well that just made it worse for me, heh
[12:45:08] <arnpro> thought I was going the right way
[12:45:27] <shoky> plugins are just functions, nothing special about them
[12:46:08] <shoky> maybe you wanna take a look at the widget factory.. takes care of some of these things for you
[12:47:17] <arnpro> will do

[13:09:40] <bot-t> blazedd, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[13:12:00] <SmashingX> Is there something wrong with this line? jQuery("#Main input:radio[id^=CIVICRM_QFID_760_6:radio").attr('checked', true);
[13:12:30] <shoky> what is that second :radio
[13:12:37] <shoky> you dont have a closing ]
[13:13:34] <Itrace_> I'm having trouble getting a selector like this to work in IE8: "... $( "div[attribute='foo'][attribute='bar']" ) ..." Is there another way I can write this?
[13:14:21] <shoky> $('div').filter('[a=b]').filter('[c=d]')
[13:14:39] <Itrace_> I'll give it a shot. Thanks.
[13:17:20] <raj> quizme, so I put a break within that function and then do something?
[13:17:45] <raj> ...that function being the one I did console.log(this) within
[13:18:02] <shoky> wacha doin
[13:18:05] <blazedd> Thanks for the help
[13:18:49] <raj> hey shoky
[13:18:53] <quizme> raj why do you want to put a break in that function?  I thought you want to access it from outside
[13:19:04] <shoky> heys
[13:19:06] <raj> just trying to get access to the "panels" array
[13:19:25] <ale__> Hello guys, the thing is that I did a $(window).bind('beforeunload', function(... but after that function I did a $(window).unload(fun.. This prompts me a message from the beforeunload but enters yo the .unload, how can I prevent this?
[13:19:31] <raj> quizme, I do
[13:19:31] <ajpiano> raj: $("#tabs").data("tabs").panels
[13:19:35] <raj> you said to find out who was calling that function
[13:20:29] <raj> beautiful, thank you ajpiano
[13:20:50] <raj> can I expect most jquery-ui components to work like that?
[13:21:21] <ajpiano> every jquery ui component will store the full "instance" in data("widgetName")
[13:21:33] <ajpiano> except maybe datepicker, that thing is not too great
[13:21:33] <raj> beautiful, thank you
[13:21:34] <ajpiano> :X
[13:22:08] <_studio> does unload not work in firefox 12?
[13:22:24] <ale__> any ideas guys??
[13:25:47] <ale__> isn't there any way??
[13:26:21] <_studio> oh. i'm setting an unload event to prevent users from closing a document when they have some sort of ongoing ajax operation happening. i see it's not possible to prevent this with unload - is there another way?
[13:26:51] <ale__> _studio: you are doing the same as me, is this ok?
[13:27:31] <_studio> am i?
[13:27:47] <ajpiano> window.onbeforeunload = function() { return false; } will give the user the dialog that asks if they want to stay on the page
[13:28:08] <_studio> onbeforeunload is proprietry i read
[13:29:12] <ajpiano> ?tias
[13:29:13] <bot-t> Try It And See
[13:31:13] <_studio> merci beaucoup

[13:32:36] <krz> anyone know how to make a simple tracking script (i.e. indicate if users are on a page) similar to guag.es or chartbeat.com ?
[13:36:15] <sgfgdf> hello, guys! is it possible to get the actual width and height of an image? i'm trying this -- $('<img class="image"/>').load(function(){ console.log($(this).width()); }).attr('src','image.jpg'); and width() returns 0.
[13:38:24] <ale__> $(window).bind("beforeunload", function(e) { e.preventDefault(); return "Disconnect"; }); -> How can I know if the user pressed "Leave" or "Stay" ??
[13:39:18] <ajpiano> i don't think you get to find that out
[13:40:18] <raj> can I find out which panel contains `someel` in $('#somecontainer>.someclass').each(function(i,someel){ $(someel).data() }) in $('#mydiv').data('tabs').panels ? There's a '.someclass' in each panel, but I want the exact what I'm working on in .each()
[13:40:35] <ale__> ajpiano: because if the user presses stay, he will still be connected to a virtual server, but if not, he will get disconnected...
[13:40:41] <ale__> ajpiano: isn't there any way?
[13:41:01] <raj> or can it not be differentiated?
[13:41:25] <ajpiano> raj man
[13:41:27] <ajpiano> come on
[13:41:32] <ajpiano> you really gotta try things harder
[13:41:49] <raj> i'm not sure how to test that
[13:42:09] <raj> javascriptly speaking
[13:42:27] <ajpiano> what do you have to "test'
[13:42:47] <ajpiano> your question is really hard to interpret
[13:43:58] <ajpiano> you want to find the tab panel that contains the .someclass element inside of the each?

[13:47:15] <bot-t> johnkpaul, Changed "helpfulhelp".
[13:47:37] <johnkpaul> ajpiano: added that yesterday for these situations
[13:48:05] <shoky> bot-t: me is bored
[13:48:05] <bot-t> shoky, Changed "me".
[13:48:12] <shoky> :F
[13:49:46] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: this is brilliant
[13:50:37] <raj> ajpiano, sorry, yes
[13:50:38] <raj> exactly that
[13:50:38] <johnkpaul> yeah, it'll be useful
[13:50:43] <johnkpaul> smart guys over in ##C
[13:51:01] <raj> not just all .someel's
[13:51:08] <raj> the one I'm currently working on in .each()
[13:51:24] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: $(someel).closest(".ui-tabs-panel") or whatever the classname is
[13:51:50] <ajpiano> lol i mean raj
[13:52:05] <johnkpaul> :)
[13:52:05] <innociv> How do I check if '2' is a number?  if( !isNaN(Number('2')) )?
[13:52:21] <johnkpaul> innociv: always an integer? parseInt('2',10)
[13:53:04] <raj> oh, that was stupid
[13:53:41] <raj> oh yeah, I just brainfarted, I wanted to access the tab's object to see the order of the tabs, according to the <a href=>
[13:54:04] <alcuadrado> is there any plan to support AMD in jquery?
[13:54:29] <ajpiano> raj:  you can use the refernce to the tab to the the index in the panels array, and use that to get the anchor
[13:54:40] <ajpiano> alcuadrado: in what way? jquery can be loaded via AMD
[13:54:48] <ajpiano> the entire library
[13:55:45] <raj> what reference to the tab?
[13:55:46] <dabear> innociv: $.isNumeric(foo)
[13:56:07] <ajpiano> the one from closest
[13:56:21] <raj> oh, to compare to the hash in anchors
[13:56:28] <innociv> parseInt seems fine. parseInt('n', 10) returns NaN
[13:56:31] <raj> nice
[13:57:05] <alcuadrado> really ajpiano ? that was added in a recent version, doesn't it?
[13:57:12] <quizme> shoky thnkx
[13:57:13] <ajpiano> alcuadrado: 1.7
[13:58:04] <alcuadrado> great news, thanks :D
[13:58:20] <alcuadrado> any idea about jquery ui supporting it?
[13:58:51] <ajpiano> i don't think it's particularly likely in the near term but there has been interest in it
[13:58:56] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: ^^ ;)
[13:59:47] <scott_gonzalez> $( "#ajpiano" ).hide( "explode" );
[14:00:00] <ajpiano> hahha
[14:02:47] <alcuadrado> ok, thanks ajpiano !
[14:05:20] <ale__> Guys, I have: intCon = setInterval(function(){ ........; clearInterval(intCont) }); On another function, can I do: setInterval(intCon, 5000); ???
[14:05:53] <ajpiano> ale__: sorry to answer your question, no i don't know of a non hacky way to do it
[14:07:23] <johnkpaul> ale__: you're trying to setInterval an integer because intCon is an integer, if you want to re-setInterval, just keep a reference to the function
[14:11:29] <mtmcfarl> i have a plugin that does $this.find(".choice").live('click', function(e) { .... }  In my page I want to also have another class bound to the click function like so: <button class="choice execute" type="button" title="execute-gather-information">Execute this Action</button>
[14:11:39] <mtmcfarl> the bind for the .execute never gets fired.
[14:12:22] <mtmcfarl> $(".execute").click(function(e) { ...}
[14:15:42] <mtmcfarl> sorry folks should have been using live instead of bind...problem solved.

[14:23:53] <ilriso> Hi guys any idea of why this isn't working http://jsfiddle.net/XeRqN/1/ ?
[14:24:01] <ilriso> Doesnt even show errors on the console
[14:29:06] <johnkpaul> ilriso: what's not working?
[14:29:35] <ilriso> johnkpaul: well I found out the problem
[14:29:53] <ilriso> johnkpaul: for some strange reason the script has to be called from outside of the head of the document
[14:30:02] <ilriso> thanks anyways!
[14:30:08] <johnkpaul> hm, I don' tknow, no problem
[14:32:49] <cheesypoof20> I have product pages with different attributes (size, color, etc...) in selects. Sometimes these attributes effect the price of the product. I have set an attribute 'set-product-price' on each 'option' that changes the price.
[14:33:51] <cheesypoof20> I am using .change to detect changes to the selects, what method would be best to retrieve the attribute value of the select option if that attribute exists?
[14:34:21] <sente> what's the proper way to load html from a random website - which isn't on the same domain - with jquery?
[14:35:44] <cheesypoof20> You can grab html from a website with .load
[14:38:08] <sgfgdf> guys, is it possible to get the actual width and height of an image? i'm trying this -- var img = $('<img class="image"/>').load(function(){ some_stuff; }).attr('src','image.jpg'); console.log(img.width()); and width() returns 0.
[14:38:53] <BarelyFitz> sgfgdf: the width won't be available until after the image loads
[14:39:53] <sgfgdf> BarelyFitz, but i try to print the width after the .load(). am i wrong?
[14:40:41] <BarelyFitz> maybe this: $('<img class="image"/>').load(function(){ console.log($(this).width(); }).attr('src','image.jpg');
[14:40:45] <johnkpaul> sgfgdf: http://jsfiddle.net/johnkpaul/j66MD/
[14:41:45] <BarelyFitz> johnkpaul: you might need to put the .load() before you set the src attribute
[14:42:10] <z1000> can someone help me figure this out .. so I have this cute little loop I use to have input fields erase value on click... then if blank set it back to default... trying to customize it to work with textboxes but having a prob getting the original value.... http://pastie.org/3891812 line 22 I believe is my issue, any insight would be great - thanks !
[14:42:24] <BarelyFitz> also I think some browsers might not actually load the image until you add that element to the DOM
[14:42:39] <johnkpaul> yeah, both of those are true
[14:42:41] <johnkpaul> ?load
[14:42:41] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[14:42:45] <johnkpaul> you can see the caveats in the docs
[14:43:16] <sgfgdf> johnkpaul, why when the load() is finished the variable has no width, and if i append another .load() as you show me it has the width?
[14:43:42] <Parhs> Hello guys.. Do you have any idea whether it is possible to combine selectable and sortable ?
[14:43:50] <Parhs> to sort with multiple itemz
[14:45:19] <BarelyFitz> z1000: .val() works with textarea, I don't think you need .text()
[14:46:26] <sgfgdf> BarelyFitz, johnkpaul-afk, thanks guys! i think i make it to work.
[14:46:41] <z1000> BarelyFitz, dunno why im crazy.. it works fine lol
[14:48:44] <demitrix> is there any way to easily resubmit an ajax request based on the reponse it receives?
[14:50:38] <krz> anyone know how to make a simple tracking script (i.e. indicate if users are on a page) similar to guag.es or chartbeat.com ?
[14:53:15] <BarelyFitz> demitrix: I don't think so. the response won't generally contain all the data that was sent in the request.
[14:55:43] <demitrix> my problem is that im using $.ajax and the response code is always okay but there may be an error in the response, if its an auth error i need to catch it, resubmit the auth info and then resend the original ajax again.
[14:56:59] <shoky> how's that a problem
[14:58:39] <demitrix> cause im not finding an easy way to resubmit the original
[14:58:52] <shoky> save it somewhere
[14:59:14] <cheesypoof20> I think I partially figured out my question above. I am encountering a problem however if I have two selects. The second one will not update the price. I think it has to do with the way I am setting the variable, any suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/hgPdg/1/
[15:04:17] <BarelyFitz> cheesypoof20: "#product-attributes select option:selected" will find both select elements, but attr() only returns the value of the first one
[15:05:05] <BarelyFitz> try this instead: var price = $(this).find('option:selected')
[15:10:11] <cheesypoof20> Yeah I figured my previous selector was too broad and needed to be narrowed. Awesome, thanks for the help.
[15:21:42] <sente> $('#content').load('<url>') makes a request for <URL> but there's the warning about access control origin... because <url> is on a different domain
[15:22:03] <sente> is there any way to load content for a random page which will work regardless?
[15:28:45] <BarelyFitz> sente: you will need a proxy on your webserver
[15:29:13] <BarelyFitz> ?proxy @sente
[15:29:13] <bot-t> sente, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[15:29:23] <BarelyFitz> no, that's not it
[15:29:33] <BarelyFitz> With Simple PHP Proxy, your JavaScript can access content in remote webpages, without cross-domain security limitations, even if it’s not available in JSONP format. http://benalman.com/projects/php-simple-proxy/ also see http://bit.ly/4DXJvU
[15:29:36] <LondonGuy> Any body have any idea what this could mean: ActiveRecord::AssociationTypeMismatch (Photo(#2179533600) expected, got ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess(#2153916820)):
[15:29:49] <LondonGuy> wrong room sorry
[15:29:53] <LondonGuy> tab*
[15:29:59] <devOlsen> lol your lookg for unity arnt you
[15:31:50] <innociv> will $('iframe').load() work on an iframe that's already loaded to do something only after an iframe is loaded, besides simply waiting for it to load if it hasn't already?
[15:32:39] <innociv> Doesn't say so on the doc page
[15:34:08] <BarelyFitz> I think it won't fire after already loaded
[15:34:15] <BarelyFitz> same as window.load
[15:35:12] <quizme> i want to record all click events on the page and capture the id of the thing that was clicked on. how do i do that?
[15:35:30] <rudak> * ?
[15:35:45] <rudak> $(*).click ?
[15:35:55] <quizme> * means every element on the page ?
[15:35:57] <BarelyFitz> no
[15:36:01] <devOlsen> $('body').click(function(e){ var $target = $(e.target); alert($target.prop('id'));});
[15:36:06] <BarelyFitz> use a live event would be better
[15:36:45] <BarelyFitz> but I don't think that will catch anything that does a stopPropagation
[15:37:07] <quizme> ok thanks
[15:37:09] <devOlsen> not unless you condition the target, no you are right, but that was not part of the orignal question.
[15:37:39] <quizme> i don't think we're using stopPropagation
[15:37:44] <quizme> but how would u get around that ?
[15:39:11] <innociv> what should I do then?  I need to wait for the iframe to load if not loaded, or otherwise just do the function normally
[15:40:10] <catcher> Anything out there that may work as an embeddable IM client, with a single conversation viewable by the public, but only 3 private participants?
[15:41:57] <raj> if I have a clickhandler on a class that has two instances, will that click handler run twice?
[15:41:59] <BarelyFitz> innociv: maybe you can set a value on the iframe whenever you load it, that tells it is completed. then you can check that value if necessary.
[15:42:40] <quizme> catcher: do u need that or are u building it ?
[15:42:53] <shoky> raj you dont have clickhandlers on classes
[15:43:15] <raj> $('.container').on('click', '.mybutton', function(e){ alert('hi')}) <-- i'm getting alerted twice
[15:43:23] <raj> there's another .mybutton in th dom though
[15:44:11] <shoky> if only one button is clicked and you havent set any other handlers.. that doesnt make sense
[15:44:42] <catcher> quizme, hoping to find something, otherwise I'll build it
[15:44:44] <shoky> do you have more than one .container ?
[15:44:54] <innociv> hm :/
[15:45:39] <raj> oh yes, I've run it twice
[15:45:41] <raj> damn
[15:45:43] <shoky> ;P
[15:46:01] <shoky> anyway , you dont have clickhandlers on classes ;p
[15:46:21] <raj> why not? so this doesn't happen?
[15:46:43] <shoky> $('.container').on  <-- this sets one handler for each .container instance
[15:47:11] <shoky> er sorry
[15:47:48] <shoky> i guess you could call the .mybutton a  class handler.. but the click handling is done on the .container instance(s)
[15:47:57] <raj> k
[15:48:23] <shoky> SORI I YELD AT U
[15:49:04] <raj> haha, is okay
[15:49:16] <shoky> bah. almost 2am and im still home
[15:49:22] <shoky> supposed to drive up north to visit friend
[15:49:27] <shoky> meant to leave around 11pm
[15:49:32] <raj> shoky, with that fileupload thing, instead of using send, can I just $.post the filedata myself?
[15:49:34] <shoky> around 2 hr drive
[15:49:57] <shoky> raj mmmm that kinda defeats the purpose of the plugin, no?
[15:50:07] <raj> damn, it's 2am? didn't know u were that much ahead
[15:50:14] <shoky> 1:50 yass
[15:50:15] <raj> does it?
[15:50:36] <raj> funny how we're awake the same hours
[15:50:37] <shoky> how would you post the filedata?
[15:50:48] <shoky> ya im definitely a night person ;)
[15:50:58] <raj> i have $(el).data('savedFileData')
[15:51:21] <shoky> yea but that's just metadata , no?
[15:51:23] <raj> which contains .files
[15:51:26] <raj> i dunno
[15:51:35] <raj> not really sure how files work
[15:51:45] <raj> thought maybe the data is in their too
[15:52:12] <shoky> actually i donno how its done with ajax/xhr but the way you were using the plugin it was using the iframe transport
[15:52:26] <shoky> so that just works with a regular form submission with file inputs
[15:53:04] <shoky> gah i'll leave
[15:53:10] <shoky> bybye;)
[15:56:06] <raj> see ya :)

[15:59:17] <devOlsen> wait so you want to convert a non-filmstrip rotator into a filmstrip rotator? why not just use an actual filmstrip rotator plugin out there vs. hacking up a solution out of something that was not designed to be a "filmstrip rotator"
[16:08:43] <aitiba> hi
[16:10:59] <krz> anyone know how to make a simple tracking script (i.e. indicate if users are on a page) similar to guag.es or chartbeat.com ?
[16:11:38] <james13433> I have an object "234,134,288" and another "234" whats the best way to check if the second is in the first?
[16:15:41] <james13433> i don't seem to be able to just run  split on it
[16:26:57] <james13433> Everyboyd asleep?
[16:27:48] <innociv> james13433, str.split(",");
[16:27:56] <innociv> and see if 234 is in that array
[16:29:02] <jstout24> i'm using jquery ui tabs and loading remote content… there are two events that are triggered when a tab is loaded, "load" and "show"
[16:29:32] <jstout24> i need to trigger an event on the first default tab (which isn't ajax loaded) only one time… so doing this, i use the "show" event
[16:30:00] <jstout24> but on ajax content, I don't want to fire the event twice since both "load" and "show" get fired
[16:30:11] <jstout24> how should i make it do just one?
[16:32:13] <james13433> innociv I get old.split is not a function
[16:32:13] <james13433> ]
[16:32:41] <innociv> it works on strings
[16:33:35] <devOlsen> jstout24, might be able to to just setup a condition in the load callback, that looks for the currently selected tabs index, and if it != 0 (meaning not first tab) perform a $.ajax request for external content.
[16:33:55] <devOlsen> err I mean in the "SHOW" callback.
[16:33:57] <james13433> How do I double check what type strict object etc, the thing is?
[16:33:57] <jstout24> yeah i was thinking that… seems hackish.
[16:35:26] <james13433> apparently its an array
[16:36:23] <james13433> but it acts stance because old[0] will give everything until the, but each() will give each character individually
[16:47:21] <|PiP|> how can i do a .load() call that replaces the element, instead of inserts inside it?
[16:47:59] <z1000> use a container?
[16:48:55] <|PiP|> z1000: hmmm, any way to rewrite .load like .loadreplace instead?
[16:49:07] <z1000> wish I knew :(
[16:56:25] <qom2> jQuery(this).parent().children(".dropdown-menu").toggle(); <- isn't there something easier?
[16:56:46] <qom2> the elements are right besides eachothers in the dom
[17:03:00] <fission6> siblings? qom2
[17:03:12] <qom2> yeah, I tried that, but it wouldn't work
[17:03:18] <qom2> not sure what I'm doing wrong

[17:08:27] <qom2> this is the markup
[17:08:36] <james13433> if(jQuery.inArray(this, array) > -1){ is returning -1 when it blatantly is in the array :/
[17:09:23] <james13433> When I do else… alert("nope"+this+array); it returns nope403403,405
[17:11:07] <james13433> both "403"'s are strings
[17:13:33] <snover> james13433: “this” is always an object, and I believe indexOf uses strict equality
[17:14:33] <james13433> Right, so if I store in a variable before? or var string =  new String(this);
[17:15:04] <snover> “new String” -> you just created a new object
[17:15:28] <james13433> right, so what do I do? :(
[17:15:35] <snover> ?eval var foo = "foo"; new String(foo) === foo
[17:15:35] <bot-t> snover: false
[17:15:44] <snover> ?eval var foo = "foo"; ("" + new String(foo)) === foo
[17:15:45] <bot-t> snover: true
[17:16:56] <james13433> snover your a genius!
[17:17:30] <snover> nah, I just know a lot of JavaScript
[17:17:36] <snover> you can too!
[17:17:57] <james13433> I wish I had time to sit and learn it
[17:25:04] <Guevara> hello! how to show a bootbox confirm dialog? http://dpaste.com/746335/
[17:25:46] <amh345> is there a way to move the contents of one div to another div?
[17:26:20] <Guevara> amh345: jquery drag drop
[17:26:31] <amh345> i mean on a doc ready.
[17:26:42] <amh345> everything ive messed with requires a .remove()
[17:29:46] <systemfault> amh345: And… what's wrong with a remove?
[17:30:23] <amh345> systemfault: i guess nothing specifically. i just want to see if there's another way to do it.
[17:30:40] <amh345> i'll just clone() and then remove() if that is my option
[17:30:56] <systemfault> amh345: You don't seem to understand what .remove() does..
[17:31:11] <systemfault> It "removes" the node from the "main" DOM tree
[17:31:17] <systemfault> It doesn't delete it.
[17:32:25] <systemfault> And if you have events bounds to these nodes, you might want to use .detach instead
[17:33:37] <amh345> i need to 'move' some form elements outside of the form and retain their structure.   then i need to have an 'add' button which adds the items back into the form
[17:38:07] <nmee> I'm wondering, does a library exist that lets you store data centrally in the script, while having UI elements "subscribe" to the data (for instance, I have a var called "is_editable", while several UI elements depend on that variable (a textarea, a save button etc.). Ideally, all the UI elements would automatically be updated regardless of where I modify is_editable. Any suggestions?
[17:40:40] <blindMoe> nmee: not sure if jquery offers this but in other languages it would be a pointer or passing by reference
[17:41:45] <nmee> blindMoe: thanks, but I'm thinking more conceptually; how one should structure larger applications in JS
[17:42:20] <fission6> nmee yea chekc out backbone.js spine.js knockout etc
[17:42:51] <nmee> fission6: thanks! backbone and spine sound related :)
[17:45:42] <nmee> fission6: wow, the backbone Events module is a perfect match - thanks again!
[17:53:40] <jenia_> hi everyone. ajaxSend contains a parameter called ajaxOptions.
[17:54:12] <jenia_> it has a property url
[17:54:23] <jenia_> in the docs it says urlA string containing the URL to which the request is sent
[17:54:50] <jenia_> what does that mean exactly? am i not the one that sets the url to which i send the ajax request?
[17:59:19] <innociv> It's where it's sent from probably.
[18:09:05] <jenia_> hello everyone. can someone please help me with this. in the ajaxSend hook
[18:09:35] <jenia_> there a argument called settings
[18:09:42] <jenia_> it has a url property
[18:10:01] <jenia_> what is that url? its the url where the POST is being sent to?
[18:14:12] <systemfault> Are you even using jquery?
[18:16:03] <sodapop> when i press a jquery button in a dialog it's style remains selected style even when the mouse is not over it
[18:16:35] <amh345> i'm creating a div class when a button is clicked.  but i find that i cannot have a .click function on that newly created div.  is there a trick for that?
[18:19:35] <DarkMukke> any1 here using Twitters bootstrap extentions ?
[18:20:45] <gavin_huang> I made multiple ajax requests and pass them to $.when(), once they are all resolved, how do I get the url for each request?
[18:22:39] <swedengles> Does any one know why this is .val and not .value? http://api.jquery.com/val/
[18:23:13] <gavin_huang> I know if I pass a single ajax request to $.when(), I can access the url from the context object (i.e., this.url), but with multiple request, their context objects seem to lost…
[18:47:10] <IvanBliminse> Hello everyone... my first time using jqueryUI. Does anyone know how to get $("#datepicker").datepicker(); to work using on html that is not live? For example, things you would normally have to use $(document).on(); to have effects happen?
[18:54:28] <sodapop> is there an official fix to remove ui-state-focus ui-state-hover from buttons located in dialog after click
[18:54:34] <aitiba> someone here as used fitText jquery plugin?
[18:55:01] <aitiba> I have jquery 1.7.1, lettering-0.6.1 and fittext
[18:55:16] <aitiba> $("h2").lettering('words');
[18:55:22] <aitiba> $("h2").fitText(0.273);
[18:55:40] <aitiba> I dont get any error but the text is not fited
[18:59:24] <hell_lord> hi, question... when binding an event.. if i use a jquery wrapper to an element (e.g. var $whatever = $('selector') does this variable reference the dom going forward, or will it continue to apply to all elements reference by the selector?
[19:00:09] <danzik171> hell_lord: the latter, it's not a live collection - whatever the collection was at the time it ran that selector, that's what it stays.
[19:03:25] <IvanBliminse> anyone know how to write   $("#datepicker").datepicker(); as a live event?  I can't figure out how to do it with $().on();
[19:04:42] <shoky> ttt
[19:06:40] <shoky> gavin_huang: read the docs for $.when
[19:07:14] <shoky>  For example, when the Deferreds are jQuery.ajax() requests, the arguments will be the jqXHR objects for the requests, in the order they were given in the argument list.
[19:07:42] <hell_lord> danzik171: thank you sir
[19:08:12] <gavin_huang> shoky, but I need to retrive the url, which jqXHR doesn't seem to have. I already create an issue for it: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11749
[19:08:54] <hell_lord> so i have a string that comes from a template (handlebars).. somehow i want to get a jquery selector reference to the top level div in this string.. BEFORE i insert it into the dom... cause then it becomes harder to find it since it has no unique id
[19:09:49] <KellyLSB> Hi so I'm trying to catch a form submit in Chrome and no matter what i try it still submits in the normal fashion? any ideas?
[19:11:50] <shoky> gavin_huang: oks. you can attach the urls easily i suppose
[19:11:59] <danzik171> hell_lord: so just do var mydiv = $( html );  mydiv.appendTo( somewhereinthedom )
[19:12:15] <hell_lord> danzik171: huzzah!
[19:12:16] <gavin_huang> you mean attach to jqXHR?
[19:12:29] <shoky> yea
[19:17:15] <gavin_huang> shoky, I guess that's a way to me. but … I don't know, seems a little hacky? what I did eventually was to create new deferred objects in .done() for each ajax request and pass them to .when()
[19:17:32] <gavin_huang> *that's a way to do it
[19:21:01] <gavin_huang> and move app logic to $.ajax().done() instead of for $.when().done(), which only calls my callback
[19:22:22] <gavin_huang> thanks for the help though. ;)
[19:24:28] <IvanBliminse> anyone have any idea on how to make something like $("#datepicker").datepicker(); plugin work with $().on; ??  #datepicker is dynamically created via ajax call
[19:25:53] <hell_lord> danzik171: hmmm didn't work
[19:28:09] <danzik171> hell_lord: what are you trying to do
[19:29:34] <hell_lord> well, i have an object which i pass a parent selector $parent
[19:29:41] <stan_man_can> Is there any way to post a form via ajax without grabbing each value individually?
[19:30:10] <IvanBliminse> I found the answer to my question, in case anyone wants to know, you have to figure out the plug-in listener, focus in datepicker's case and do something like.. $(document).on("focus","#datepicker",function(){ $(this).datepicker(); });
[19:30:16] <hell_lord> then i do this.html = template(config.data); this.$elem = $(this.html); this.$elem.appendTo($parent);
[19:30:43] <binaryfus10nz> $(this).data('original', $(this).val()).val('');
[19:30:50] <binaryfus10nz> can someone help me understand exactly what that is/does ?
[19:32:36] <danzik171> hell_lord: and what doesn't work about it?  can you make a jsfiddle demonstrating what you're having problems with?
[19:33:30] <hell_lord> id ont' think ever assigned $parent :(
[19:45:28] <hell_lord> danzik171: yeah i was referencing this.$parent instead of config.$parent
[19:45:32] <hell_lord> danzik171: it works, thanks

[19:52:47] <rocketman> Does someone have a min to take a look at a slider I am using? It is having a resizing problem and I am not sure how to fix it.
[19:53:06] <rocketman> Click on work and then you will see the problem http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14080718/Ajax-Test2/%25resize14.html#intro
[19:53:17] <binaryfus10nz> does .load have a callback that actually works?
[19:53:34] <binaryfus10nz> and when I do .load of a page that has some rlly large images... do they download before finishing the .load ?
[19:53:43] <binaryfus10nz> or does it just need the src url as text

[20:03:09] <zodiak> hey guys and gals, anyone got a nice example of how to call the template rendering in jquery-ui rather than the deprecated jquery-tmpl ?
[20:20:48] <bridera> Hey all.. can someone help me understand why my bug tracker's jquery.min.js is using an XHR to pull in a joomla template's stylesheet in a completely different directory?
[20:21:33] <bridera> I've traced the issue using chrome to line 5847 of jquery.js, looks like it's firing callbacks of some sort, but I don't know enough about debugging javascript to go further.
[20:22:46] <defaultro> hey folks, window_0 is the div name. How was this code able to make the div disappear? How does it know it was a div?    $('#window_0').hide()
[20:23:11] <defaultro> what does $('#window_0') mean?
[20:23:50] <tw2113> are you sure that's not the ID as well?
[20:24:12] <defaultro> could be the id
[20:24:20] <tw2113> the # would indicate such
[20:24:23] <defaultro> the code is generating that string on the fly
[20:24:26] <defaultro> yeah
[20:24:45] <defaultro> so jquery knows what to do when it sees that kind of syntax?
[20:25:09] <defaultro> and does this kind of syntax always refer to div?
[20:25:14] <tw2113> the # indicates selecting an ID
[20:25:18] <tw2113> a . would indicate a class
[20:25:25] <defaultro> yup, i'm aware of that
[20:25:40] <tw2113> whether it's a div or not is dependent on what the ID is an attribute of
[20:25:40] <defaultro> however, this syntax is confusing me -> $('#window_0')
[20:25:52] <defaultro> dollar sign then parenthese
[20:26:01] <tw2113> that's the jquery selector though
[20:26:07] <tw2113> well, function
[20:26:10] <defaultro> k
[20:26:40] <tw2113> someone else with more knowledge will have to explain the $() part
[20:26:56] <defaultro> k
[20:28:03] <tw2113> you could do the same with jQuery('#window_0')
[20:29:00] <defaultro> k
[20:29:15] <defaultro> that reminds of the issue that my officemate fix
[20:29:49] <defaultro> they loaded 2 js scripts, and a code was complaining. THey checked it in firebug and saw the incorrect prototype
[20:30:12] <Codenoob> hello
[20:30:14] <defaultro> it was also using $
[20:30:18] <Codenoob> can someone please help me with a basic javascript question?
[20:30:29] <Codenoob> I am struggling to understand what this array operator means in the context of an if statement
[20:31:02] <Codenoob> if I am doing the basic "head first javascript
[20:31:03] <Codenoob>  "
[20:31:42] <Codenoob> lesson about creating a "for" loop that shows seats boolean values within an array
[20:31:59] <Codenoob> what do the brackets in if (seats[i]) mean?
[20:32:29] <Codenoob> sorry if I'm in the wrong spot..
[20:32:56] <tw2113> i assume the array variable is "seats"
[20:33:05] <Codenoob> yes, exactly
[20:33:12] <tw2113> and the [i] inside the foreach loop is passing in the i counter variable
[20:33:18] <tw2113> to compare against array index
[20:33:29] <Codenoob> var seats = [false, true, false] and so on
[20:34:35] <tw2113> well, in boolean logic, "1" is equivalent to true
[20:34:45] <tw2113> so i'm guessing i = 1 in your case
[20:35:02] <tw2113> if your array has boolean values in it
[20:35:10] <Codenoob> well the code they provide
[20:35:18] <Codenoob> has i = o in the foreach loop
[20:35:25] <tw2113> won't be a bad idea to pastebin it
[20:35:31] <Codenoob> awesome
[20:35:33] <Codenoob> how can I do that?
[20:35:46] <tw2113> pastebin.com
[20:35:49] <tw2113> jsfiddle.net
[20:36:11] <tw2113> different but similar
[20:36:16] <Codenoob> oh awesome
[20:36:17] <Codenoob> here:
[20:36:19] <Codenoob> http://pastebin.com/38J91deZ
[20:36:42] <Codenoob> this is the code that tells you if each seat is available or taken
[20:37:18] <Codenoob> I tried to figure out what the [] meant by subsitution
[20:37:28] <Codenoob> i == true has the same effect as the original code
[20:38:12] <tw2113> oooh i see what's going on
[20:38:26] <tw2113> though not sure why it's written that way
[20:39:11] <tw2113> eh, kinda
[20:39:51] <tw2113> the seats variable has boolean values
[20:39:58] <tw2113> the for loop loops through them all
[20:40:14] <Codenoob> ohhhhh
[20:40:16] <Codenoob> so
[20:40:27] <tw2113> and the if statement checks for seats[1] which returns true, i believe, if it's not at the end of the array
[20:40:35] <Codenoob> with the if/else statements if the if (x) has x=true or x=1
[20:40:39] <tw2113> and thus ays "seat # is available" each time
[20:40:41] <Codenoob> then you proceed to the statement under if
[20:40:58] <tw2113> ooh wait
[20:41:10] <Codenoob> yeah you're right. it breaks it if i do i == true
[20:41:15] <tw2113> seat[i] references the value
[20:41:26] <tw2113> which in turn returns either false or true
[20:41:32] <tw2113> based on the value
[20:42:27] <raj> if I clone an element, does its .data() go with it?
[20:42:39] <Codenoob> yeah
[20:42:41] <raj> or does that depend on .clone(true) ?
[20:42:41] <Codenoob> that makes perfect sense
[20:42:59] <Codenoob> so [i] just says seats index i
[20:43:01] <raj> or not at all
[20:43:18] <Codenoob> thank you so much this irc channel rocks
[20:43:19] <tw2113> yeah, seat[i] just references array indexes
[20:43:30] <raj> nm

[21:11:29] <IvanBliminse> am I wrong in my thinking that you can send an associate javascript array through $.post(); ??
[21:12:16] <binaryfus10nz> any suggestions on best options to use to animate http://preview.tinyurl.com/wtfhuge1234 parallax and mouse listeners can get laggy rlly quick... :?
[21:22:10] <shoky> rajraj
[21:27:56] <shoky> IvanBliminse: you're not wrong
[21:29:14] <raj> yesss
[21:29:16] <raj> shoky
[21:29:17] <raj> !
[21:29:28] <raj> so happy to see you
[21:29:36] <raj> i've got another fileupload question of course
[21:30:02] <shoky> heh ok, im vncing from my friends
[21:30:20] <raj> nerd
[21:30:39] <shoky> he's out driving someone home
[21:30:44] <shoky> i m bord
[21:30:55] <raj> I'm using tabs now, and when someone submits, the form, there are multiple forms with multiple fileinput fields(like we had before). But I need to know which tab the file is in. I tried sending the info in data.files['tabnum'], but that never makes it across to the serverside
[21:31:07] <raj> good, i'm glad to keep you on your toes ;)
[21:32:22] <raj> is there any way to add an additional key to data.files?
[21:32:29] <shoky> only one form is submitteed?
[21:32:30] <raj> or is that some spec-regulated object?
[21:32:45] <raj> well, it collects the data and files from the other forms too
[21:33:20] <raj> probably should just had 1 form with multiple divs, but i'll do that once everything's done and working
[21:33:32] <shoky> there was  a way to add a post parameter with the plugin
[21:33:35] <raj> don't wanna meddle with stuff while something specific is broken
[21:33:40] <raj> formdata
[21:33:45] <shoky> yea
[21:34:03] <raj> but if I use formdata, it doesn't have any relation to the files
[21:34:08] <raj> formdata is just kinda sent on its own
[21:34:45] <Cork> ...
[21:34:50] <raj> only thing I can think of is using the filesize and filename together to determine which file formdata belongs to
[21:35:17] <raj> i don't like that I can't add additional keys to go along with the file
[21:35:40] <Cork> coldhead: ping
[21:36:07] <raj> hey Cork
[21:36:13] <Cork> ello raj
[21:36:16] <coldhead> Corksy
[21:36:30] <Cork> coldhead: care to do something about evixion?
[21:36:57] <Cork> lol
[21:37:05] * tga tries to figure out promises
[21:37:37] <tga> if I want to have a login() function that has success() and error(), like the ajax calls
[21:37:41] <tga> that's the promise interface, right?
[21:38:31] <coldhead> little fella just wanted some love
[21:38:45] <Cork> tga: no success and error is a subset renamed from deferred
[21:40:07] <tga> Cork, is there a way to chain multiple deferred events or can they only have success/error?
[21:40:10] <Cork> tga: deferred default names are fail and done
[21:40:21] <shoky> raj i dunno if multipart requests allow data specific to certain 'parts', (not sure tho), shouldnt be hard to build a hashtable with key=filename+size as you suggested. (or maybe just an index is enough to identify ?)
[21:40:32] <Cork> tga: you can chain them, thats the point, but like i said its not success error
[21:41:01] <raj> shoky, exactly, but that's not allowed
[21:41:13] <shoky> in formdata
[21:41:14] <tga> Cork, I'm a bit confused -- if I have a login() function that makes an ajax() call
[21:41:24] <Cork> tga: ah
[21:41:24] <raj> oh, right
[21:41:32] <Cork> tga: thats another matter
[21:41:39] <tga> Cork, then I want to chain it like login().success(do_this).error(do_that)
[21:41:46] <Cork> tga: sounded like you wanted to do your own implementation :)
[21:41:56] <Cork> tga: ya, that will work
[21:42:06] <tga> Cork, right, what I tried at first was to return the ajax() object
[21:42:10] <Cork> even login().success().error().error().success()
[21:42:12] <tga> so chaining success() on that worked
[21:42:37] <tga> trouble is, my ajax call returns success always, even if the login is wrong
[21:42:44] <raj> k, trying
[21:42:55] <tga> so I would like to create my own events like login().loginFailed(dothis).loginOK(dothat)
[21:43:00] <Cork> tga: ya, cause the ajax call successes
[21:43:03] <shoky> goodluck;p
[21:43:03] <tga> right
[21:43:35] <tga> Cork, so what do I need to do to allow for custom callbacks like that?
[21:43:39] <tga> those are promises, right?
[21:44:09] <Cork> tga: no its deferred like i said
[21:44:29] <Cork> tga: but the simplest solution is to have your server return status code 401 when the login fails
[21:44:41] <tga> Cork, can't, 3rd party api
[21:44:45] <Cork> that will make ajax work the way you want it with no changed code
[21:44:48] <Cork> ouch
[21:44:55] <samzhao_> hi everyone
[21:45:02] <tga> Cork, and I'm looking for a generic solution, maybe next time I have three deferred events
[21:45:30] <samzhao_> i discovered an interesting plugin recently for uploading files through ajax
[21:46:06] <samzhao_> http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/
[21:46:07] <Cork> ?deferred @ tga
[21:46:07] <bot-t> tga, http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[21:46:35] <Cork> you'll lose all of the other jqXHR functions though
[21:46:38] <raj> shoky, it doesn't send a filesize to the server either
[21:47:02] <raj> there's a change it's a different size on the user's system and on my system, no?
[21:47:08] <raj> so i can't calculate size with my server
[21:47:15] <raj> and filename alone isn't reliable
[21:47:15] <samzhao_> the problem, though is it works fine on my website where i allow users to upload images, but I have no idea how to associate the users with the images
[21:47:26] <shoky> er why would it be different size?
[21:47:59] <raj> cuz sometimes I see that files are different sizes on different mediums
[21:48:16] <Cork> tga: though you could attach your own deferred object handlers to the jqXHR before you return it and it should work quite well
[21:48:16] <raj> even windows says 'size on disk' and 'size on filesystem'
[21:48:19] <raj> or something like that
[21:48:30] <shoky> hmm that doesnt have to do with filesize
[21:48:45] <shoky> thats windows telling you  how much the file is ACTUALYL wasting on disk
[21:48:48] <shoky> but its not filesize
[21:48:53] <raj> so it'll 100% be correct to the byte?
[21:49:00] <tga> Cork, I'll handle the jqxhr separately and fire my own events that are relevant to the task
[21:49:08] <samzhao_> anyone?
[21:49:11] <shoky> should be yeah raj
[21:49:21] <Cork> tga: i meant if you want to keep the ex. .abort() feature
[21:49:49] <shoky> k friend back by rqajj
[21:49:54] <ndss56> Anyone have experience with Coffee script? Its the way of the future in javascript programming i was told.
[21:50:27] <coldhead> its A way of the future, sure
[21:51:09] <tga> Cork, no, I just like the ability to chain deferred events
[21:51:20] <tga> Cork, I don't care much how login works, but I need async results
[21:51:30] <raj> shoky, thanks! =)
[21:51:33] <raj> have fun
[21:51:38] <Cork> tga: do you care about the handler names?
[21:51:47] <Cork> or is done and fail good enough?
[21:52:01] <tga> Cork, in this case it will be, for for other places I'll have multiple callbacks
[21:53:27] <granden> I got some bug with my jquery on this page, http://a45.se/actesolutions/
[21:53:49] <granden> When first loading the page, if pressing on the last image at the bottom before it starts auto-jumping
[21:53:58] <Cork> hmm interesting the've changed how ajax use deffered in 1.7
[21:54:09] <granden> it changes to the second not last image
[21:56:02] <granden> ok, acctually that bug I manage to solve myself pretty easy :)
[21:56:24] <granden> now there is just another strange bug, if pressing image 4 and then fast pressing image 3, the text stays
[21:56:36] <granden> or any two other button combination as well.
[21:57:00] <Cork> ah they've renamed _Deferred to Callbacks
[22:00:19] <samzhao_> anyone has any experience on this plugin??
[22:00:24] <samzhao_> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[22:00:44] <coldhead> lot of folks here have used that, yes
[22:01:04] <samzhao_> @coldhead: are you talking to me?
[22:01:14] <coldhead> sigh
[22:01:17] <coldhead> so many questions
[22:01:26] <coldhead> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE PLUGIN SAMZHAO_
[22:01:42] <coldhead> let's get on with it :)
[22:01:45] <samzhao_> OMG! finally someone replied
[22:02:01] <samzhao_> i'm using Python on appengine with that plugin
[22:02:19] <samzhao_> but i dont know how to associate the user which uploads the file
[22:03:18] <coldhead> samzhao_: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options check the bit about formData
[22:04:13] <samzhao_> @coldhead: which one am I supposed to look at?
[22:04:54] <coldhead> formData
[22:04:58] <coldhead> as i said
[22:05:02] <coldhead> near the bottom
[22:05:09] <coldhead> lets you send arbitrary data with your upload
[22:06:02] <coldhead> look here's a bunch of examples https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/How-to-submit-additional-Form-Data
[22:08:36] <samzhao_> @coldhead: got it! wow
[22:09:32] <samzhao_> @coldhead: but I still don't understand how would the formData be stored. well i guess it's Python's job
[22:10:14] <coldhead> python should see it like a regular POST submission
[22:10:25] <samzhao_> @coldhead: yup
[22:10:32] <coldhead> good luck!
[22:10:46] <samzhao_> @coldhead: another question: does it give you the option to set cookies and things like that?
[22:11:12] <coldhead> i'd use the jquery cookie plugin for that
[22:11:27] <samzhao_> @coldhead: so that people with the same email or something can't upload more than once
[22:11:27] <coldhead> and i don't know if the cookies will be sent with the fileupload
[22:11:32] <coldhead> you'd have to try it and see
[22:11:43] <coldhead> oh that you could handle in the browser
[22:11:47] <tutankamon> hi, I'm having problems with this code :(
[22:11:48] <tutankamon> http://pastebin.com/Jtsuy4ub
[22:12:01] <coldhead> when you do the submission $.cookie('uploaded', true)
[22:12:10] <coldhead> then test for $.cookie('uploaded') next time
[22:12:25] <coldhead> its a very simple plugin, check its docs
[22:13:22] <samzhao_> coldhead: i've been reading through the docs many times, and still find out less info than you did.. thanks though!
[22:13:27] <coldhead> tutankamon: find('vote-saving') should probably be find('.vote-saving')
[22:13:42] <coldhead> very welcome, samzhao_
[22:13:48] <samzhao_> coldhead: oh did you suggest me to use a cookie plugin?
[22:13:49] <coldhead> docs and advice is a power combo
[22:14:04] <coldhead> yes, you need to use that guy to handle cookies with jQuery
[22:14:12] <coldhead> its teensy and beautiful
[22:14:27] <tutankamon> coldhead: no the error is when I bring voteContainer
[22:14:27] <coldhead> tutankamon: i would use ?data
[22:14:28] <bot-t> tutankamon, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[22:14:31] <coldhead> instead of attr
[22:14:34] <tutankamon> it doesn't have anything inside
[22:14:35] <samzhao_> coldhead: for sure. the thing is I never read through the entire doc, I usually just look for the parts I need at the moment
[22:14:38] <tutankamon> this would be
[22:14:42] <tutankamon> <span class="voteButton voteUpButton" data-voteType="UP"></span>
[22:14:49] <coldhead> samzhao_: you probably want examples then :)
[22:14:57] <tutankamon> so I bring voteContainer
[22:15:01] <samzhao_> coldhead: exactly
[22:15:13] <tutankamon> but then for exmaple contextId = voteContainer.attr('data-contextId'),
[22:15:17] <tutankamon> gives me an error
[22:15:33] <coldhead> voteContainer.data('contextId'),
[22:15:38] <coldhead> is a better way to get the same info
[22:16:00] <coldhead> tutankamon: can you link to a live demo or put it on jsfiddle? we're guessing otherwise
[22:16:06] <tutankamon> the empty values which should not be empty are
[22:16:18] <coldhead> i see
[22:16:37] <tutankamon> contextId, contextType, rootContextId, rootContextType
[22:16:53] <coldhead> the ones you are getting via attr()
[22:16:56] <coldhead> i said use data() instead
[22:17:02] <coldhead> consider trying my advice! :D
[22:18:02] <coldhead> tutankamon: you should read this http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/09/using-jquerys-data-apis
[22:18:08] <coldhead> and be enlightened forever
[22:18:34] <tutankamon> I might
[22:18:38] <tutankamon> but I need this fast
[22:18:43] <tutankamon> no time now sorry
[22:19:16] <coldhead> unfortunately this channel is more for helping people understand than it is for meeting deadlines we have no involvement in
[22:19:23] <coldhead> but good luck!
[22:19:46] <tutankamon> well maybe some other user....
[22:20:12] <coldhead> yes, please, step forward mystery user
[22:20:18] <coldhead> please
[22:20:33] <coldhead> DOES ANYONE HAVE A MAGIC WAND
[22:20:35] <tutankamon> seems like it's pretty quiet
[22:20:48] <coldhead> maybe you could try my advice while they warm up the wand?
[22:20:51] <coldhead> i would
[22:21:00] <greggies> come forward silent rogue and receive thy prize
[22:22:34] <granden> Using fade in, and reading the doc it says the image should be hidden first. is it display:hidden?
[22:22:38] <granden> I should use in css?
[22:28:53] <tutankamon> I tried with value
[22:28:55] <tutankamon> it says
[22:29:16] <tutankamon> "object#object has no method value"
[22:30:34] * coldhead facepalms

[22:33:50] <dr0id> how dare you use pastebin.com
[22:34:41] <coldhead> i am so sorry
[22:34:43] <tw2113> coldhead is a rebel
[22:34:51] <coldhead> let me send you an amazon gift card
[22:35:06] <samzhao_> coldhead: thank you
[22:35:15] <coldhead> samzhao_: you are quite welcome
[22:35:42] <samzhao_> coldhead: so how are you going to send me the gift card?
[22:35:46] <tw2113> rebel without a cause!
[22:36:59] <coldhead> samzhao_: i am sending it to dr0id, care of his address and in his name
[22:37:13] <dr0id> :3
[22:37:14] <coldhead> if you want to stake out his house and steal his identity that's a matter for you and him
[22:37:20] <tutankamon> nope sorry
[22:37:41] <coldhead> then all hope is lost
[22:37:48] <tutankamon> anybody else knows this?http://pastebin.com/dDf1v5q0
[22:37:54] <samzhao_> coldhead: I don't have time to do that. Need to figure out this stupid python and appengine problem..
[22:38:19] <samzhao_> ok, the problem is not stupid; I am.
[22:38:20] <coldhead> "i got 99 problems but stealing dr0id's identity isn't one of them"
[22:38:24] <coldhead> much respect
[22:38:53] <tutankamon> ain't one
[22:39:03] <samzhao_> dr0id seems like a nice guy/gal, and i dont do bad things to nice persons
[22:39:04] <tutankamon> stealing droids identity aint one
[22:39:17] <coldhead> i am glad we had this chat
[22:39:18] <tutankamon> if you wanna jayz him all over
[22:39:24] <dr0id> I am also glad we had this chat
[22:39:43] <tutankamon> i am also glad
[22:39:47] <tutankamon> but my problem is not solved
[22:39:53] <samzhao_> coldhead: i'm glad there's a thing on earth called irc
[22:40:02] <samzhao_> tutankamon: mine either
[22:40:19] <samzhao_> need to figure out how to do datastore and stuff in appengine
[22:40:26] <coldhead> i will bow out now and stop wasting your time. good day gentlemen.
[22:40:37] <coldhead> sorry tutankamon
[22:40:42] <samzhao_> coldhead: you too
[22:48:08] <coldhead> tutankamon was such a jerk
[22:51:43] <raj> I created a click handler on an element before it was added to the dom
[22:52:05] <raj> and now, when I try finding a .closest('.somelement'), it can't find it
[22:52:19] <raj> cuz it craps out up to the parents that existed when I set the click handler
[22:52:23] <raj> any way to overcome this?
[22:52:59] <raj> coldhead^^ ?
[22:54:55] <coldhead> not sure i follow, raj
[22:55:02] <coldhead> you know the deal, show don't tell
[22:55:19] <raj> fair enough
[22:56:01] <raj> actually, I landed at another solution, but I'm interested to know the answer to that anyway... so headed to fiddle
[22:58:05] <coldhead> meanwhile on earth: https://a248.e.akamai.net/media.pinterest.com.s3.amazonaws.com/upload/192599321534619280_wOhJZwYO_c.jpg
[23:06:17] <raj> coldhead, actually, somehow it works on jsfiddle
[23:06:34] <raj> but in my code I can't navigate around the dom
[23:07:24] <coldhead> innnteresting
[23:07:33] <coldhead> maybe your html is broken?
[23:07:58] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/ctptY/
[23:08:17] <raj> except when I console.log($(e.target).closest('#something') ... I get nothing
[23:08:31] <raj> I can only go up to the <table>
[23:10:21] <coldhead> raj: it may be that you're trying to bind before you append the element
[23:10:31] <raj> I am
[23:10:40] <coldhead> does it work if you append first?
[23:10:49] <raj> but isn't that what I've done in the jsfiddle?
[23:10:57] <raj> I've bound it, then appended
[23:10:58] <raj> yet it works
[23:11:17] <coldhead> it could be different doctypes or something
[23:11:28] <coldhead> i don't really know much about events at that level
[23:11:37] <zulu-gula> hi
[23:11:47] <zulu-gula> is there a plugin that can do something like this: http://www.muzeumbrowaru.pl/historia-browaru.html
[23:11:50] <coldhead> i just know a similar thing happens with data(), gotta insert it first
[23:12:04] <raj> hmm k
[23:12:04] <zulu-gula> I can do it only with animation, but it would be better to have plugin and save my time
[23:12:26] <raj> the click handler works though coldhead
[23:12:52] <raj> the problem is that I can't move up the domtree passed the table
[23:13:03] <raj> basically, passed the $table variable
[23:13:23] <coldhead> i don't know, raj
[23:13:28] <raj> k
[23:13:33] <raj> thanks for looking
[23:13:35] <coldhead> i've never done something this crazy and awesome: column_array = $.map(column_array, $);
[23:13:40] <coldhead> you have much to teach me
[23:13:59] <raj> honestly, that's all johnkpaul-afk
[23:14:02] <raj> :)
[23:14:06] <raj> never knew that could be done either
[23:16:42] <coldhead> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/ctptY/1/ ?
[23:16:51] <coldhead> doesn't actually shed any light on the issue, but it works
[23:17:22] <raj> the other one worked too
[23:17:25] <raj> that's the problem
[23:17:29] <raj> the fiddle worked, my local code doesn't
[23:17:46] <raj> i think the issue might be that that whole fiddle is actually within a $.each()
[23:17:48] <raj> maybe
[23:17:49] <raj> i dunno
[23:17:53] <raj> anyway, I found a workaround
[23:19:56] <cheesypoof20> Could someone please explain why the .remove code in this example is not working for the added options? http://jsfiddle.net/ar7LN/3/
[23:22:12] <skylamer`> зкш еьъг
[23:25:24] <coldhead> cheesypoof20: http://jsfiddle.net/ar7LN/6/
[23:25:34] <coldhead> click() only works with elements already in the page
[23:25:46] <coldhead> you need to use on() to bind to elements that might be added later
[23:25:50] <coldhead> ?on @ cheesypoof20
[23:25:50] <bot-t> cheesypoof20, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[23:26:52] <cheesypoof20> I'll take a look, thanks for the help.
[23:27:25] <arguser> hello
[23:27:36] <coldhead> welcome to you, arguser
[23:28:07] <arguser> i'm looking for a script which grayscale a color (no img) when link is visited.
[23:29:31] <arguser> it should took the color and give a greyscale equivalent when visited
[23:29:55] <skylamer`> coldhead, why 'remove link on click' dont working for dynamically added contents like this?
[23:31:08] <skylamer`> ye, i undderstand
[23:34:04] <cheesypoof20> arguser: are you going to have different colored links?
[23:34:31] <arguser> cheesypoof20: yes, look: http://arguser.com.ar/links.html
[23:35:58] <arguser> cheesypoof20: colors are assigned by a script
[23:36:22] <arguser> cheesypoof20: hope it doesn't make it harder
[23:37:24] <cheesypoof20> what are the links in this situation, the squares in the middle?
[23:39:21] <cheesypoof20> your lightbox css is absolute linked to your localhost server btw
[23:40:08] <granden> Anyone who could help me with a simple problem, my script works fine in everybrowser except IE. Where the buttons is not clickable.
[23:40:18] <granden> http://a45.se/actesolutions/
[23:40:39] <granden> THe autoscroll works, but when clicking there is a problem
[23:46:53] <asher^> is there a way i can .each through sets of radio buttons?
[23:47:03] <asher^> id like to .buttonset() each of them
[23:52:17] <cheesypoof20> granden: If I open up IE's developer tools and check 'continue after exception' or uncheck 'break on error' the script works. Sorry, I can't help you pinpoint the problem though, beyond my abilities.
[23:52:18] <someprimetime> yo
[23:52:52] <someprimetime> i'm writing a modal plugin.. should i pass the width in so that when you click on a link, it sets the width right away, or determine the width of the container within my controller?
[23:53:07] <someprimetime> i'm thinking just set it explicitly
[23:53:31] <someprimetime> otherwise i'd do what plancast does where they just load an animated gif and then resize once the html fragment comes back from the controller
[23:54:21] <granden> cheesypoof20: How do you open developers tools in ie?
[23:55:24] <coldhead> arguser: http://jsfiddle.net/s2NfW/
[23:56:00] <coldhead> skylamer`: you probably need to use on() or live() instead of click()
[23:57:04] <arguser> cool, thanks! Going to try it coldhead
