[00:00:04] <Cork> it means nothing or everything
[00:00:12] <Cork> it doesn't not mean a web markup standard
[00:00:20] <Cork> that is "html"
[00:00:37] <Cork> ?g whatwg html live
[00:00:39] <b-ot> Cork: HTML Standard - WhatWG â†’ http://www.whatwg.org/html
[00:00:42] <Yahkob> heh
[00:00:57] <Yahkob> there are some cool new things in html5
[00:01:06] <Cork> no
[00:01:07] <Yahkob> i like the drag and drop support
[00:01:11] <Cork> again html5 isn't a think
[00:01:32] <Cork> it is a missued word that means nothing or what ever someone want to put into it
[00:01:50] <Cork> so if you want to have technical talks about features, use something ppl can get a meaning from
[00:02:00] <Cork> not marketing speak for "something awsome"
[00:02:25] <Cork> think==thing
[00:03:53] <Yahkob> Thanks Cork
[00:04:04] <Yahkob> thats awesome to know
[00:04:14] <Cork> ...
[00:04:17] <Yahkob> not being sarcastic but I wouldn't want to sound like an asshole in a tech talk :P
[00:04:21] <Yahkob> really not being sarcastic
[00:04:29] <Yahkob> no pun intended
[00:04:35] <Yahkob> with the 'awesome' remark haha just noticed that
[00:04:49] <Yahkob> i am relatively new to the programming world so its nice to know these things
[00:05:08] <Cork> Yahkob: ok, so back to the original question
[00:05:14] <Cork> html is a markup language
[00:05:23] <Cork> it means you can statically define things to show on a page
[00:05:40] <Cork> it has no way what so ever to DO anything
[00:05:48] <Cork> if you want something to act you need js
[00:06:16] <Cork> basically like you can make a paper animate
[00:06:23] <Yahkob> Ah thats kinda what i figured
[00:06:31] <Yahkob> window.location.origin will have to do
[00:06:37] <Cork> but if you draw a bunch of papers and put in on a wheel you can make the wheel animate it
[00:06:43] <Yahkob> i wanted to be fancy now i am ashamed of myself

[02:37:06] <valentinmu> please, help me anyone) http://jsfiddle.net/5754B/
[02:37:37] <valentinmu> when clicking delete, it doesn't delete row in table
[02:37:48] <valentinmu> but it definetly should
[02:38:12] <Cork> valentinmu: you need to delegate the event handler
[02:38:23] <Cork> else you will only have one for buttons that exist on page load
[02:39:09] <Cork> valentinmu: http://jsfiddle.net/5754B/1/
[02:45:45] <valentinmu> Cork: but i cant understand why my variant is not working?
[02:46:41] <Cork> valentinmu: 1. page load, 2. the table and add random button is added (dom parsed), 3. read i called
[02:46:53] <Cork> 4. the event handler is added to add_random_ticket
[02:47:10] <Cork> 5. searches for elements with the class delete_ticket, but doesn't find any
[02:47:16] <Cork> 6. you click add random ticket
[02:47:26] <Cork> 7. add_ticket is called and the tr is added
[02:47:31] <Cork> 8. you click delete
[02:47:40] <Cork> 9. no event handler is added to it, so nothing happens
[02:48:38] <Cork> valentinmu: the delete element is added in step 7
[02:48:49] <Cork> but you try to add the event handler in step 5
[02:49:23] <Cork> valentinmu: the solution is to add the event handler to an element that exist
[02:49:40] <Cork> and have it listen for events bubbling up from children added to it later in the pages life
[02:50:41] <valentinmu> Cork: I understood, Thanks a lot! :)

[03:35:26] <sash87> Hi guys I wan to know about different slideshow category with example.
[03:35:32] <sash87> different types are.. 1.Graduated fade 2. Slide in/out 3. Fade in/out 4. Cross fade 5. Zoom and fade
[03:35:39] <sash87> o does anybody have an idea what is a 1.Graduated fade or 2. cross fade ??
[03:59:49] <gnu_d> Hi, how do I get the data when I'm in autocomplete event Change, I want to know if I have 0 items in the data to show the autocomplete list ?
[04:00:27] <Cork> gnu_d: the change event is prob the wrong place
[04:00:45] <Cork> gnu_d: are you using a remote data source?
[04:00:56] <gnu_d> Cork: yes, I'm using a remote data source
[04:01:07] <callumacrae> $('blabla').is('*') is like a shitty version of $('blabla').length, right?
[04:01:18] <Cork> gnu_d: so source: 'url', ?
[04:01:26] <gnu_d> Cork: yes, I made something there, if data == 0, but I thought it's not the right thing to do
[04:01:28] <Cork> callumacrae: yes
[04:01:47] <Cork> gnu_d: you have two options
[04:01:52] <Cork> either do it in source
[04:02:00] <Cork> or attach a custom render function
[04:02:09] <callumacrae> cool, thanks
[04:02:11] <Cork> (the later is prob what you're looking for)
[04:02:12] <callumacrae> looks weird
[04:02:34] <gnu_d> Cork: when I do the check in the source, how to tell the autocomplete to be visible ?
[04:03:21] <Cork> gnu_d: i don't think you can
[04:03:37] <gnu_d> Cork: then there is no solution :(
[04:03:39] <Cork> gnu_d: have a try and see if .data('ui-autocomplete')._renderItem is called
[04:04:29] <Cork> gnu_d: what you might have to do is give a special value from source when there is no match
[04:04:38] <Cork> and then react on that value in the render function
[04:04:38] <gnu_d> Cork: what about: _renderMenu: function( ul, items ) {
[04:05:10] <Cork> gnu_d: interesting, that function is new to me
[04:05:20] <Cork> yes, that might be exactly what you want!
[04:05:28] <gnu_d> Cork: has items, I can tell it if items == 0,  and then what :) ?
[04:06:05] <Cork> gnu_d: just have _renderMenu render the replace content you want to show
[04:07:51] <gnu_d> Cork: it doesn't triggers
[04:08:15] <Cork> gnu_d: like i said you prob need to send a "fake" array from source
[04:08:55] <gnu_d> Cork: I already done that in source, but it's stupid, and empty item is being visible at the bottom
[04:09:13] <Cork> gnu_d: only if you render it from _renderMenu
[04:09:26] <gnu_d> I see
[04:14:46] <obert> hello, do you get a recommendation about a photo gallery script?
[04:14:47] <gnu_d> Cork: I managed to get it triggered, however I don't how to make it not render
[04:15:06] <Cork> gnu_d: just don't call _renderItemData
[04:15:20] <gnu_d> Cork: I tried that, I added return
[04:18:22] <gnu_d> Cork: silly me, for each item it was adding an object label, value :D, so I needed to check if the first item in the items array has label === '', to break the rendering
[04:22:53] <obert> none?

[04:27:32] <lietu> do you know if jQuery 2.x runs on the native browser on Android 2.3 and iOS 5.0 Safari? .. all I can find is some note about backing out optimizations that didn't work on android 2.3 from some beta release notes, but can't seem to find any real "supported browsers" -list
[04:32:40] <Cork> lietu: the only support removed in jquery 2.x compared to 1.9+ is ie < 9
[04:33:16] <Cork> lietu: https://jquery.com/browser-support/
[04:33:45] <Cork> and by supported, they mean tested and guaranteed
[04:34:02] <Cork> if you need it on an older browser, you will have to test that yourself
[04:34:09] <lietu> hmm .. ok .. thanks!
[04:34:50] <Cork> lietu: though jquery should work just fine in all none ie browsers
[04:35:01] <Cork> as long as you only talk about dom manipulations
[04:35:38] <lietu> mainly I'd actually use it for Ajax wrapping, which I expect to be pretty well supported
[04:35:49] <Cork> ya
[04:35:57] <Cork> as long as you don't need cors
[04:36:46] <lietu> I don't think I do
[04:36:59] <lietu> .. shouldn't at least
[04:37:11] <Cork> it should be easy to tell
[04:37:24] <Cork> if the site and server is the same, then ya you don't
[04:37:31] <lietu> for current needs sure, but not always so for the future needs ;)
[04:37:51] <lietu> but I think the architecture shouldn't have any need for that
[04:39:54] <Cork> it can always be proxied for browsers that doesn't support it

[05:14:50] <uskerine> simplest way to check that input is not null or has only blank/spaces?
[05:14:57] <uskerine> by input I mean <input>
[05:15:19] <Cork> uskerine: you could use the html validate attributes
[05:15:31] <Cork> if depending on newer browsers is ok
[05:16:18] <uskerine> could you point me to an example or suggest me where to look for?
[05:16:27] <Cork> ?mdn input
[05:16:28] <b-ot> Cork: <input> - HTML | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input
[05:16:29] <MikeD_> how would you express a null in an html input?
[05:17:04] <Cork> MikeD_: can only be ""
[05:18:18] <MikeD_> idk what you consider simple, but what about   ( /[^\s]/ ).test(  .val() )   ?
[05:18:39] <uskerine> that sounds simple
[05:19:01] <uskerine> What html validate attribute does if validation fails?
[05:20:06] <MikeD_> isn't that going to be browser-specific?
[05:20:11] <Cork> no
[05:20:15] <Cork> it is in the spec
[05:20:24] <Cork> though ya, it isn't supported in older browsers
[05:20:39] <uskerine> Cork, but what happens if validation does not succed?
[05:21:08] <Cork> uskerine: try and see :)
[05:21:11] <uskerine> ok
[05:21:54] <uskerine> I think it is easier to do the test, so validation can be incorporated to regular app flow
[05:22:02] <uskerine> Miked_ I am buying your test
[05:22:06] <uskerine> :)
[05:22:12] <MikeD_> i really like the html-level validation, but the default behavior is only good enough - not great.  Once a picky customer sees it, they want additional features or styles
[05:22:41] <MikeD_> i know, "only good enough" seems like i should be happy
[05:25:01] <uskerine> I assume that html-level validation will raise a standard browser popup, which will break the whole app look&feel
[05:25:52] <MikeD_> that said, it's a good idea to use those validation attributes anyway - because if you fallback from your awesome script add-on you'll still have the browser's implementation of range checking (or whatever) - and of course you have some server-side sanity checking too (right? :p ) so a multi-layered approach is good.
[05:26:42] <uskerine> provided that you have enough time and money for that
[05:30:27] <MikeD_> i never really understood that mentality.
[05:43:14] <uskerine> MikeD_ you are right, but unfortunatelly I am in a hurry to prototype this stuff :( One validation fits for now

[06:24:55] <decx> but a th doesnt have a value
[06:25:42] <MikeD_> th has text though
[06:25:57] <decx> so :contains(blah)

[06:36:54] <valentinmu> help from anyone else is also appreciated :)
[06:37:00] <uskerine> what is the issue with no delegating?
[06:39:23] <krambiorix> hi, i have over 100 input fields in a form. Each field can contain multiple value errors... How can i store these errors for every element? Can I, for example,  add an array of errors to an element?
[06:41:54] <Cork> krambiorix: you want to store them when you validate them or what?
[06:43:23] <str8uplinux> uskerine: ok, i'm confused here. .on() isn't working on content that was added to the page via $.ajax success function. I thought .on() was bound to an element on the page load?
[06:46:51] <decx> i gave you an example with a delegating on
[06:47:01] <valentinmu> i have a row in a table that conains some data cells and cell with button that removes the row. how can i get contents of data cells when click delete?   http://jsfiddle.net/5754B/1/
[06:47:28] <decx> there's another one
[06:47:35] <decx> how many people are deleting rows today?
[06:48:38] <krambiorix> Cork, yes
[06:48:50] <Cork> krambiorix: you could store it in .data()
[06:49:29] <Cork> or just use an array and positions of the element as index
[06:50:49] <krambiorix> Cork, can't i store an array in data()?
[06:51:28] <Cork> krambiorix: sure
[06:51:44] <Cork> krambiorix: everything you can point to with a variable can be stored in .data
[06:51:55] <Cork> .data('my-array', [])
[06:52:03] <Cork> .data('my-array').push('something')
[06:53:18] <krambiorix> Cork, now i keep it in an array and give every field (on load) a unique id. But when i use forms in a dialog, i have to give all input fields in the page + dialog again an id...
[06:53:48] <Cork> krambiorix: no need
[06:54:36] <Cork> $('input').each(function() { if(!is_valid_function($(this).val())) { $(this).data('error', []); } });
[06:56:44] <nielsnl> Good evening every one.
[06:56:44] <nielsnl> I have a quesion about moving some div's into view point http://jsbin.com/damibuse/1/edit
[06:56:44] <nielsnl> This example shows 4 boxes on visable the other just outside the viewpont Now i want to scoll the workspace so that box A,B or C are shown.
[06:56:45] <nielsnl> I tried some things already but i dont get it to work
[06:56:55] <nielsnl> can someone assist me?
[06:57:37] <Cork> nielsnl: you mean you want to animate the scrollbars?
[06:57:42] <Cork> or what is the question?
[06:57:47] <nielsnl> yeag
[06:57:52] <nielsnl> yeah
[06:59:08] <nielsnl> I want indeed to animate the scrollbars
[07:00:59] <krambiorix> Cork, but how can i check if the error is already in the array ?
[07:01:16] <nielsnl> Cork: In the above example i can move the workspace by pressing the 2 buttons but how to know how much i need to move to show on of the other boxes.
[07:03:27] <Cork> krambiorix: http://jsbin.com/damibuse/2/edit
[07:03:47] <Cork> took a while before i realized that the workplace wasn't the one with the overflow :)
[07:03:56] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[07:03:59] <Cork> nielsnl: ^
[07:04:12] <Cork> krambiorix: you would have to search the array
[07:04:27] <Cork> $.inArray() should prob help
[07:11:31] <Cork> nielsnl: and for the how much http://jsbin.com/damibuse/3/edit
[07:11:58] <Cork> you prob want to check if the value is more or less then the current view
[07:12:13] <Cork> so you can scroll it into view and not statically try to get it to the top left corner
[07:12:19] <Cork> (as it currently does)
[07:17:04] <nielsnl> Thanks, Cork. i was just playing like this: http://jsbin.com/damibuse/4/edit
[07:17:04] <nielsnl> but with this when you click the button twice it always scroll somewhere different
[07:17:10] <krambiorix> Cork, my errors in data() work perfect
[07:17:14] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks a lot!
[07:17:20] <Cork> nielsnl: that said, you might want to test the scrollTo plugin
[07:17:26] <Cork> ?g jquery.scrollTo
[07:17:27] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.ScrollTo â†’ http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[07:18:39] <decx> how is that 200 lines long?
[07:18:54] <decx> isnt it just scrollTop(el.offset().top) ?
[07:19:40] <decx> apparently not -.-
[07:20:15] <BillCriswell> decx: Don't overcomplicate things
[07:20:26] <Cork> decx: ify ou use the plugin yes
[07:20:35] <Cork> else no it isn't
[07:20:37] <krambiorix> how can i open the jquery ui tooltip automatically?
[07:21:44] <decx> trigger('open') maybe
[07:22:36] <jop008> anyone using netbeans as IDE?
[07:22:44] <jop008> I try to use code folding
[07:22:49] <mazpe> is there a way to set like a session variable? in my case will be $month so that i can call it from any method in the controller
[07:22:56] <mazpe> oh wrong window
[07:22:57] <mazpe> lol
[07:23:19] <decx> is the syntax of jqui tooltip inconsistent to everything else or is that just me?
[07:25:51] <Cork> decx: jquery ui isn't fully consistent with jquery
[07:25:57] <Cork> but it is consistent with it self :)
[07:28:19] <uskerine> jop008 I do
[07:28:29] <uskerine> what is code folding?
[07:29:14] <Cork> uskerine: it means you can collapse part of the code
[07:29:18] <uskerine> you mean collapse/expand?
[07:29:19] <uskerine> ok
[07:29:23] <Cork> like the content of an if case, a function or so on
[07:29:37] <uskerine> jop008 what issue do you have with code folding? netbeans does it by default
[07:30:06] <decx> Cork i was just fooled because it used $('document').tooltip({items: 'element'}) but $('element').tooltip() also works
[07:30:09] <jop008> I have a html page with javascript code on it
[07:30:23] <jop008> Right mouse click suggets I can collapse code
[07:30:32] <jop008> but it won't do that
[07:30:50] <uskerine> if you share the code I will copy and paste into my editor and see what happens
[07:30:50] <jop008> in preferences I can't find javasccript under code foldeing
[07:31:07] <uskerine> you don't need anything to do code folding, just use the [+] and [-] icons that automatically appear at the left
[07:31:30] <jop008> I don't have + and - around blocks
[07:31:41] <uskerine> weird
[07:31:58] <jop008> I agree :-)
[07:31:59] <uskerine> maybe projects settings, you don't need to do anything to activete them
[07:32:18] <uskerine> activate*
[07:32:25] <krambiorix> trigger('open') to show the tooltip automatically doesn't show it... Anyone else?
[07:32:31] <jop008> I didn't do anything but missing them using latest version 8.0
[07:32:41] <uskerine> I am using 8 too
[07:32:41] <jop008> downloaded yesterday
[07:32:43] <uskerine> and they are there
[07:33:34] <uskerine> in options -> editor -> folding
[07:33:40] <uskerine> Ihave Language: ALL LANGUAGES
[07:33:46] <uskerine> ENABLE CODE FOLDING
[07:33:52] <uskerine> Collpase by Default: nothing
[07:33:56] <uskerine> Display options:
[07:34:01] <uskerine> Content Preview: selected
[07:34:05] <uskerine> Show summary: selected
[07:34:21] <uskerine> maybe you want to double check that, although I assume you've been there
[07:35:09] <uskerine> not having code folding can be really annoying sometimes
[07:44:04] <EdwardIII> hey, having a brain freeze, can't seem to see why this ends up locking up (presumably infinitely looping): http://jsfiddle.net/U4X3t/
[07:44:36] <EdwardIII> ah wait, i see it
[07:44:54] <decx> randomLinkNum is not random_link_num
[07:45:48] <decx> i don't want to fathom what's going on with the timer so i'll just step back
[07:56:40] <silverdust> I have most of my jquery plugins init like if($().plugin){$('element').plugin();}
[07:57:10] <silverdust> To save other pages where those plugins aren't called
[07:57:21] <silverdust> now I have this tinymce.init({selector:'.tinymce'});
[07:57:32] <silverdust> How do I check if it's available?
[08:01:38] <onethfour3> how do i convert 9 tds to 1 td with colspan=9 on?
[08:02:42] <onethfour3> how do i delete the first 9 tds of a tr ?
[08:02:44] <silverdust> onethfour3: you'll use their parent tr to pick them
[08:02:53] <silverdust> are they the only ones in the tr
[08:03:02] <silverdust> or the tr contains more than 9?
[08:03:04] <onethfour3> no there are other tds in there as well
[08:03:06] <onethfour3> yes
[08:03:18] <onethfour3> i only want to remove/replace the first 9
[08:03:19] <silverdust> use a for loop then
[08:03:37] <onethfour3> hmm
[08:03:43] <silverdust> for(i=1; i<=9; i++)
[08:03:45] <onethfour3> td:first).remove
[08:03:47] <valentinmu> i have a row in a table that conains some data cells and cell with button that removes the row. how can i get contents of data cells when click delete?   http://jsfiddle.net/5754B/1/
[08:04:01] <silverdust> yes onethfour3
[08:04:08] <silverdust> on the :first
[08:06:44] <valentinmu> hey, anyone :(
[08:07:36] <silverdust> valentinmu: I'm looking through your fiddle to see if I can come up with any help
[08:09:09] <valentinmu> silverdust: i need to modify last block to get contents of nearby columns
[08:09:28] <silverdust> when you click delete?
[08:09:30] <valentinmu> last block of js code :)
[08:09:33] <valentinmu> yep
[08:09:59] <valentinmu> i need to get numbers from row and seat columns
[08:11:03] <valentinmu> i tried to play with .parents().each() but with no result :(
[08:12:08] <decx> why parents?
[08:12:56] <silverdust> I think you should create a closure in remove()
[08:13:53] <silverdust> that will pick .siblings('.ticket-price')
[08:13:54] <valentinmu> decx: because in my actual html, i have <img> instead of "delete" string
[08:14:07] <decx> parents is still wrong
[08:14:50] <valentinmu> decx: yep, i didn't get expected result
[08:15:35] <angell> hey folks, I'm working on a textarea and I want to limit the amount of user input. Since the intended functionality is to be used as an editor, and the insertion of images, variable line heights, etc make a character length limit impractical, i'm wondering how I can limit the content of a textarea where the elements are not just characters?
[08:15:40] <decx> here's one way valentinmu http://jsfiddle.net/decx/5754B/2/
[08:16:38] <duch_kazatel> angell define "limit" - what are you limiting?
[08:17:06] <decx> valentinmu http://jsfiddle.net/decx/5754B/3/ even
[08:17:11] <decx> no need for an object
[08:17:48] <angell> duch_kazatel: the text area is the size of a letter sized page, if what the user is inputing (images, titles, text, etc) overflows this size I want the overflowing part to be passed on to the next page.
[08:17:54] <angell> duch_kazatel: like word
[08:18:36] <duch_kazatel> "next page" is ephemeral.  is this going to be used for printing?
[08:18:52] <angell> duch_kazatel: yes
[08:19:09] <duch_kazatel> angell then you want print styles.  you can't really do what you want otherwise.
[08:19:52] <angell> duch_kazatel: do you mean as in width, height, padding, margin?
[08:20:14] <angell> duch_kazatel: for a letter sized page?
[08:20:14] <duch_kazatel> angell i mean with everything.
[08:20:18] <duch_kazatel> are you familiar with print css?
[08:20:30] <angell> duch_kazatel: I'm afraid not
[08:20:35] <decx> LUCKY
[08:20:45] <duch_kazatel> http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/24/how-to-set-up-a-print-style-sheet/
[08:20:50] <duch_kazatel> tons of articles and tutorials out there.
[08:21:15] <duch_kazatel> be aware, however, that you cannot control what the user does once they hit "print" - they can change page size, orientation, etc.
[08:22:11] <angell> duch_kazatel: I'm aware of that, everything will be used soley with  letter sized pages in portrait orientation, same margins
[08:22:11] <decx> i got money for making a website print without url data and paddings
[08:22:26] <decx> just called teh technician to set up the options on the client machine
[08:22:28] <decx> .-.
[08:22:34] <jParkton> noice
[08:22:51] <decx> i still feel bad for writing up 2 hours for it ^^
[08:23:12] <angell> decx: sounds like you have surplus of money, I'll gladly help you with your problem :D
[08:24:33] <duch_kazatel> angell just to reiterate, you cannot control the user's print settings - otherwise, print css is what you want.
[08:25:12] <angell> duch_kazatel: why exactly do I need print css? It looks like it turns a webpage into a printable page, wouldn't I already be doing this by limiting the format of the user created content to conform a to letter sized page layout?
[08:25:41] <duch_kazatel> that's how you limit it - print styles.
[08:26:27] <duch_kazatel> if you're trying to make a WYSIWYG kind of setup, you're in for a helluva lot more than that.
[08:26:59] <decx> might i suggest https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/css/main.css#L205 for printstyle groundwork
[08:27:05] <angell> duch_kazatel: I probably should have specified, that what I'm planning to do is print to PDF through a PHP script...
[08:27:19] <angell> and since all dimensions are in mm
[08:27:38] <duch_kazatel> angell okay, so you control the printer.  then you need to do this server-side.
[08:28:01] <angell> duch_kazatel: yes, the server side part doesn't bug me, it's the front end side.
[08:28:15] <duch_kazatel> but the printer will autmatically put something on the next page for you - i don't understand what the front end has to do with that.
[08:28:27] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to show the user where page breaks will occur?
[08:29:21] <angell> duch_kazatel: I'm drawing the pages word style.
[08:31:42] <duch_kazatel> then you're in for a world of hurt.  probably a lot of browser/platform specific css files to make sure that what they see on the screen is the same as what gets printed.
[08:31:59] <duch_kazatel> but somebody else might have more experience with that.
[08:32:49] <angell> duch_kazatel: it only needs to run on chrome... and it is already working correctly in IE, Safari, Opera, Firefox
[08:34:13] <duch_kazatel> i feel like i'm not getting something here, then.  your original question was about "limiting user input", then it became about displaying things as they'll appear on a page, now you're saying you already have it working in everything but chrome.
[08:36:39] <angell> duch_kazatel: I'm afraid you didn't answer my original question and instead responded with "is this for printing" and we went into that topic. My original question stands, limiting user input per page, where each page will be a text area.
[08:37:06] <angell> angell: if it cannot be done easily, I already have an alternative.
[08:38:29] <duch_kazatel> that is a strange thing to want to do imo.  somebody else may disagree, but without understanding the use case and other related factors it was hard to help.
[08:39:10] <duch_kazatel> sorry!
[08:41:00] <duch_kazatel> http://blog.jquery.com/2014/07/03/dont-use-jquery-latest-js/ - woah.
[08:41:38] <angell> duch_kazatel: oh well, it really doesn't matter, I'm afraid i can't tell you how it is going to be used because of a standing 6month NDA.
[08:42:18] <angell> duch_kazatel: I already have an alternative, thanks anyways.
[08:44:14] <duch_kazatel> kay
[08:44:30] <MikeD_> if I trigger a click handler on an a tag with a target=_blank, does that open a new window/tab ?
[08:44:47] <duch_kazatel> if you don't stop the default event, yep.
[08:53:38] <T|ASK> Hi, I have a general question. How can I verfy if a webpage (using jquery) is sending data to the webserver while filling in a webform? I have a page which let me fill in several form pages with "Next" buttons.
[08:54:09] <duch_kazatel> T|ASK are you sending things via ajax?
[08:54:52] <T|ASK> I just want to make sure, that with each step no form data is send to the server, before the last step is confirmed. It's not my webpage it's a foreign ones
[08:55:25] <duch_kazatel> you could hook into the global ajax events adn that might tell you something.
[08:55:47] <duch_kazatel> I'd open up your network panel in your favorite developer tools and look there though.
[08:56:54] <T|ASK> Is ther a guide which helps me to do this? I'm fairly new to JS programming, besides I know how to debug sources a bit. I'm using Firefox webdev
[08:57:19] <duch_kazatel> if you're using the firefox tools, just open them up and go to the "network" tab.
[08:57:43] <T|ASK> and then press "Next" I guess
[08:57:49] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[08:58:16] <duch_kazatel> is the page fully reloading after you click "next"?
[08:59:30] <T|ASK> yes looks like and there is a POST page shown in Network
[08:59:59] <duch_kazatel> if the page is fully reloading, then that has little to do with JS.
[09:00:01] <T|ASK> I guess, then I should see my filled in data in the Parms tab on the right
[09:00:13] <duch_kazatel> yep
[09:00:58] <T|ASK> ok, I try it with the next form now
[09:02:51] <T|ASK> interstingly the POST  Form data shows my formfield Data which I typed in...
[09:03:23] <T|ASK> Is this an idicator that they transported this content to the server?
[09:08:40] <T|ASK> Or generaly said, if there is an HTML Post page listed with formfield parameters in the NEtwork tab was this data transfered to the server?
[09:09:38] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[09:09:46] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[09:15:00] <johnline> hiya, been a while since i done web stuff
[09:15:17] <johnline> what's the best jquery lighbox plug out there at the moment?
[09:15:18] <T|ASK> I try to validate my assumption, that a gov page is able to store entered data on their servers without asking or informing the user that data is already transmited to the server
[09:17:03] <T|ASK> they are asking for transmission the data to their server on the last form page, while I think all data was already transfered (even just for verification) to their server
[09:17:50] <T|ASK> And if I write them, I want to be sure, that my guess it technically right .)
[09:21:59] <duch_kazatel> T|ASK once you hit my page, I can collect basically anything you do without you knowing.
[09:23:19] <MikeD_> duch_kazatel: some countries have laws about that kind of thing though
[09:23:40] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ welcome to the sketch world of Terms of Service and Privacy Policies.
[09:24:14] <decx> maybe in the us, over here the consumer protection rules are actually enforced
[09:24:32] <MikeD_> I spent years adding several layers of scumware... er... 3rd party affiliate marketing to corporate sites.  I know how much near-evil lurks in a page. :)
[09:25:07] <duch_kazatel> international rules become the problem there - if a european user visits a site in the US, enforcement becomes funky.
[09:26:47] <T|ASK> Sure, I know everything is  possible. I just want to help them to improve their terms of service to the actual things which happen
[09:26:58] <duch_kazatel> T|ASK are you stateside?  or elsehwere?
[09:27:07] <T|ASK> Or better don't transfer form data beforhand
[09:27:22] <T|ASK> I'm elsewhere
[09:27:29] <duch_kazatel> fight the good fight then :)
[09:27:50] <T|ASK> I fight for pure clientside form filling solutions :)
[09:27:50] <MikeD_> heh, thanks to Tor, he's every elsewhere there can be.
[09:28:25] <duch_kazatel> T|ASK that's... kind of an odd concept.
[09:28:43] <decx> did you hear that tor news a while ago?
[09:28:47] <duch_kazatel> we do validation client AND server side.
[09:28:52] <T|ASK> And I want them to be able to let customers online fill forms and let them decide if they want to print the form out or transmit all data.
[09:28:53] <decx> nsa labels tor users as extremists
[09:28:55] <duch_kazatel> decx wasn't an exit node operator arrested?
[09:29:02] <decx> that happens all the time yes
[09:29:22] <duch_kazatel> T|ASK huh?  why would they print it?
[09:29:27] <decx> even googling tor gets you on a list now
[09:29:35] <duch_kazatel> decx yeah that's pretty excessive
[09:30:29] <T|ASK> duch_kazatel: because their SSL is weak ,)
[09:30:48] <duch_kazatel> okay?  then what?  they mail it in?
[09:31:45] <MikeD_> i think about the fact that once you remove the real outliers, those who were comfortably within 1SD of mean are suddenly the new outliers.
[09:33:08] <duch_kazatel> git checkout -- .
[09:33:11] <T|ASK> duch_kazatel: For now I want them technically do what the say. NO, the bring it to the giv side and they put it in folders
[09:33:11] <duch_kazatel> woops wrong window
[09:34:06] <duch_kazatel> do what now?
[09:35:12] <T|ASK> duch_kazatel: Currently they gave the customer an empty paper form. They now offer this new webform, but actually seem not to tell the user that everrything he fills in is already transfered to their servers.
[09:35:49] <duch_kazatel> kay
[09:36:29] <T|ASK> They ask at the end of this form for permission, that they are now allowed to transfer the data. I want them to know that this is currently not the right place to put this in. They should move it to the start :)
[09:36:52] <duch_kazatel> does their PP state that they collect data?
[09:37:05] <duch_kazatel> basically "at will"?
[09:37:25] <T|ASK> I think this is generally said
[09:37:30] <duch_kazatel> kay
[09:37:32] <T|ASK> not technically
[09:37:53] <T|ASK> it'S not just one form its about 30 pages
[09:38:34] <decx> are you a lawyer?`
[09:38:39] <duch_kazatel> ^
[09:38:57] <decx> usually businesses leave the lawyer stuff to lawyers
[09:39:09] <T|ASK> and the user has to enter very private data here. And it with the question for allowance to transfer the data to the servers at the end this might be a serious problem
[09:39:14] <decx> i would help but i only specialize in bird law
[09:40:27] <duch_kazatel> T|ASK if their Privacy Policy states they collect data you enter, you may not have any real recourse.
[09:40:58] <T|ASK> That's why I try to make sure, that my assumptions, that they already transfer data with each form confirmation.
[09:41:07] <johnline> what's the best jquery lighbox plug out there at the moment?
[09:41:17] <duch_kazatel> also - just because that information is transmitted DOESN'T mean they're storing it.
[09:41:27] <duch_kazatel> johnline just need a modal?
[09:41:31] <MikeD_> johnline, what's the best kind of cake out there?
[09:41:39] <duch_kazatel> i prefer jqmodal, but that's just because it suits my needs.
[09:41:48] <johnline> i would like simplicity and responsive, not huge reams of js and css
[09:42:02] <duch_kazatel> jqmodal is a good choice for that, then.
[09:42:03] <T|ASK> duch_kazatel: Surely not, it's just to tell them they should improve another thing, next to other issues I found
[09:42:07] <duch_kazatel> or you can write your own.
[09:42:14] <johnline> ty i'll have a look
[09:43:30] <leo32ft> can i ask a question about google maps API
[09:43:50] <decx> you could, but now you asked to ask so we will ignore you
[09:43:56] <duch_kazatel> T|ASK we don't store everything that gets sent to us until final submission - in some cases, we're just validating it.
[09:44:40] <leo32ft> >
[09:44:50] <T|ASK> duch_kazatel: I thought it's possible to validate forms for patterns on the clients side
[09:45:01] <leo32ft> i want to geocode the lontitude and latitude of a zip code through geocoding, here is the code i am using > pastebin.com/3VSdiSpC
[09:45:10] <T|ASK> duch_kazatel: sure, not if you have to validate entered data agains stored data
[09:45:13] <Egahtrac> Hey, is there a way to trigger an event when a document is closed?
[09:45:13] <leo32ft> however sometimes it does not output the longitude and latitude
[09:45:20] <leo32ft> and its in testing phase, so am sure there are not 100,000 requests a day
[09:45:28] <Egahtrac> i saw that unload() is deprecated
[09:45:30] <Egahtrac> is there another way?
[09:45:32] <duch_kazatel> T|ASK for convenience, sure.  then the end user doesn't support HTML5 or javascript and they're hosed.
[09:45:57] <duch_kazatel> we do both client-side AND server-side validation.
[09:46:04] <duch_kazatel> also: you can break client-side validation on your end.
[09:46:41] <T|ASK> duch_kazatel: those forms don't need the latter. It just needs to validate against patterns for Date, EMail, ohter contact data, which is easy to validate via RegEx patterns
[09:47:16] <Xal_> Does anyone know why $("#reasonBox") would return an undefined? There is a div with that ID. I checked, and the spelling and case are the same.
[09:47:26] <duch_kazatel> lmao "i don't know much about programming but i assure you i am an expert on user experience wrt forms
[09:47:32] <Xal_> It's being called in $(document).ready()
[09:48:28] <duch_kazatel> Xal_ any errors in the console?
[09:48:42] <Xal_> Actually, no. If I call it directly in $(document).ready(), it works fine. But if I call it in a function that is being called by $(document).ready(), that's when it doesn't work.
[09:48:59] <duch_kazatel> can you share your code in a fidde?
[09:52:05] <Egahtrac> anyone have an answer for me? Can you trigger an event or function when a document is closed?
[09:52:24] <Egahtrac> i've trued unload() and window.onunload
[09:52:28] <Egahtrac> tried*
[09:53:28] <duch_kazatel> probably not since the browser is closing and won't wait around for you to do whatever.
[09:53:36] <Xal_> http://jsfiddle.net/fBF3G/
[09:53:39] <vexati0n> why are my xmlhttprequest calls never terminatiing, even if i use a timeout and/or abort() ?
[09:53:47] <duch_kazatel> Egahtrac https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.onunload
[09:56:16] <duch_kazatel> Xal_ that code doesn't work because 'this' isn't the select in that first call.
[09:56:28] <Xal_> of fuck
[09:56:32] <Xal_> oh fuck
[09:56:33] <duch_kazatel> that's why you're getting  g.nodeName is undefined in the console.
[09:57:14] <Xal_> yeah, I copied that from ready() into the function and forgot I had a $(this) in there.
[10:13:54] <the8thbit_> Hello
[10:14:14] <the8thbit_> Is there any way to select the child of this which belongs to a specific class with jquery?
[10:14:31] <duch_kazatel> the8thbit $(this).find('.class') you mean?
[10:14:45] <the8thbit_> duch_kazatel: That looks like it does what I want. Thanks!
[10:19:33] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/PTRMa/ On the Step Two tab the 3rd item down labled "Vendor Manager's average hourly salary" if you start typing in a number as it gets larger it will automatically add a comma where its supposed to go. But in order to add and use this value to calculate other items on this page I have to get the value without a comma. From looking at the console you can see whats happening.
[10:19:33] <phelix> Wherever the comma is at its splitting the number up there. Anyone know how I can get that whole value?
[10:21:18] <duch_kazatel> parseFloat(theInput.val().replace(/,/g));
[10:21:28] <duch_kazatel> (that's without looking at your fiddle.
[10:21:53] <phelix>    val = val.toString().replace(/,/g,''); is what I am doing now
[10:22:33] <phelix> and if i have the number say 1,234 its fine at 123 but once the 4 comes in and a comma shows up it changes to just 1 its splitting my value up where the comma is at
[10:22:42] <phelix> let me try that parse FLoat
[10:22:54] <duch_kazatel> val = parseFloat(val.toString().replace(/,/g,''));
[10:22:59] <duch_kazatel> give that a shot.
[10:24:01] <phelix> nope. its still giving me the digit before the comma instead of the whole number
[10:25:09] <duch_kazatel> console.log(val) before you change anything - what do you get?
[10:26:14] <phelix> ahh its doing the exact same thing
[10:27:04] <duch_kazatel> so your value is bad ;)
[10:27:10] <phelix> that is weird..
[10:27:20] <duch_kazatel> also you have a whole lotta repition going on here.
[10:27:24] <phelix> well... how would I make it unbad? I have a section that is putting the comma in. Is that whats causing it?
[10:27:51] <duch_kazatel> dunno, don't have time to really dig in.
[10:28:06] <duch_kazatel> but i'd abstract out your $('input.two-money1').on('keydown', function(event) { handlers.
[10:29:04] <phelix> line 74-86 is whats adding the comma
[10:29:12] <duch_kazatel> inputValue = parseInt($this.val()); - fix that.
[10:29:39] <duch_kazatel> also, parseInt takes two arguments.
[10:32:28] <phelix> hmm removing the parseInt it doesn't seem to like that much I only get NAN
[10:32:37] <duch_kazatel> ...
[10:32:55] <duch_kazatel> inputValue = parseInt($this.val().replace(/,/g), 10);
[10:34:00] <phelix> this back inside the commaRemove function?
[10:34:22] <duch_kazatel> no.
[10:34:33] <duch_kazatel> look for inputValue = parseInt($this.val()); in your code.
[10:34:45] <phelix> ok i see
[10:35:46] <phelix> ok I replaced that.. Stil seems to be splitting at the comma
[10:36:06] <duch_kazatel> update and shoot the link over pls
[10:36:11] <phelix> k
[10:36:20] <sshaginyan> Guys, how would I find all attribute values within/under elements `script or noscript or iframe` that have attribute keys as `src or href`?
[10:36:30] <duch_kazatel> sshaginyan wat
[10:36:39] <duch_kazatel> sshaginyan what are you trying to do?
[10:37:49] <sshaginyan> I'm trying to find all attribute values under a certain element that have attributes keys as either src or href.
[10:38:00] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/PTRMa/3/
[10:38:02] <sshaginyan> That's the best I can explain it.
[10:38:22] <sshaginyan> So
[10:38:30] <duch_kazatel> so you want all children of an element with a src or href attribute?
[10:38:45] <sshaginyan> yes
[10:39:30] <duch_kazatel> $(element).find('[src],[href]')
[10:39:34] <sshaginyan> $( "element[(src|href)=*]" )
[10:39:51] <sshaginyan> duch_kazatel: and if it was multiple elements?
[10:39:53] <duch_kazatel> but scripts can't have childrne like that.
[10:39:56] <duch_kazatel> *children
[10:40:07] <sshaginyan> scripts?
[10:40:28] <sshaginyan> $(element1, element2).find('[src],[href]') does this work as well?
[10:40:29] <duch_kazatel> $('element1, element2, element3').find('[src],[href]');
[10:40:41] <sshaginyan> cool thanks
[10:40:43] <duch_kazatel> your question was "how would I find all attribute values within/under elements `script or noscript or iframe` that have attribute keys as `src or href`?"
[10:40:53] <duch_kazatel> scripts don't have children like that.
[10:41:07] <duch_kazatel> for iframes you'll need .contents()
[10:41:56] <sshaginyan> duch_kazatel: scripts have a href tag. Don't they?
[10:42:19] <duch_kazatel> sshaginyan "within/under" implied "children"
[10:42:22] <decx> no
[10:42:29] <duch_kazatel> and no, they don't.
[10:42:35] <duch_kazatel> they have a src attribute.
[10:42:40] <duch_kazatel> or contents.
[10:42:42] <sshaginyan> sorry yes src
[10:42:43] <duch_kazatel> but not a "tag"
[10:43:04] <sshaginyan> is there an attribute tag?
[10:43:08] <duch_kazatel> no.
[10:43:13] <sshaginyan> I don't remember seeing one
[10:43:14] <duch_kazatel> tags HAVE attributes.
[10:43:21] <sshaginyan> yes
[10:43:33] <duch_kazatel> src="http://domain.com/script.js" is an attribute.
[10:43:55] <sshaginyan> k
[10:44:03] <duch_kazatel> can you explain the actual problem you're trying to solve?
[10:44:09] <duch_kazatel> that kind of question smells of XY to me.
[10:44:43] <sshaginyan> duch_kazatel: I'm building a distributed crawler in node.js and I'm scraping information using cheerio.
[10:44:57] <sshaginyan> with bloomfilters
[10:46:27] <duch_kazatel> okay.  if you just want all elements that have an href or a src, do that selector I said earlier.  if you need to limit it to script tags and iframes, use what I gave you but replace .find() with .filter()
[10:47:36] <sshaginyan> thank you man
[10:47:56] <duch_kazatel> that's an expensive operation, though.  cache that before you do anything with it.
[10:48:26] <sshaginyan> will do
[10:50:26] <sshaginyan> duch_kazatel: So I don't need to do filter for noscript right?
[10:51:11] <duch_kazatel> sshaginyan noscript tags can't have src or href attributes afaik.
[10:51:26] <duch_kazatel> let me see if you can even select content in them - i think you can/.
[10:52:48] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/a58BD/
[10:53:02] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[10:53:39] <BillCriswell> I never have the gems I need installed... ever
[10:53:45] <sshaginyan> lol
[10:53:47] <sshaginyan> you can't
[10:53:57] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell sounds like your problem is ruby.
[10:54:22] <sshaginyan> So you can't even get inner html right?
[10:54:35] <duch_kazatel> "inner html" of what?  noscript tags?
[10:54:51] <BillCriswell> When I'm working with npm I rarely run into issues like this, with gems it always seems to happen.
[10:54:58] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell exactly.
[10:55:09] <sshaginyan> yes
[10:55:21] <BillCriswell> bundler is a false prophet... or I'm using it wrong. Probably the second thing, but I'm just annoyed.
[10:55:35] <BillCriswell> Everything is installed according to the damn gem file.
[10:55:50] <BillCriswell> I want to punch a baby.
[10:55:53] <duch_kazatel> sshaginyan you'd have to do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/a58BD/1/
[10:56:02] <duch_kazatel> though that's not guaranteed to be cross-browser.
[10:57:22] <sshaginyan> duch_kazatel: I get this back Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: &lt;a id="moveMe"&gt;some text&lt;/span&gt;
[10:57:26] <decx> you can access with js inside a noscript tag?
[10:57:32] <decx> wat
[10:57:37] <duch_kazatel> sshaginyan what browser?
[10:57:42] <sshaginyan> chrome
[10:57:45] <duch_kazatel> because in FF that works :)
[10:57:51] <duch_kazatel> it depends on the browser.
[10:57:56] <sshaginyan> k
[10:58:00] <duch_kazatel> hence the cross-browser compatibility issue.
[10:58:48] <jop008> anyone knows the latest pglugin of netbeans on jquery mobile googled this http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/43006/jquerymobile
[11:00:23] <duch_kazatel> wut
[11:01:19] <duch_kazatel> oh.  that's probably the most recent version, jop008
[11:02:01] <jop008> You also need to add the jquery js file to your project so netbeans would be able to parse it and to properly add code completion.
[11:02:19] <jop008> will it be done by adding it to a project?
[11:02:20] <duch_kazatel> most people i know don't use netbeans.
[11:02:33] <duch_kazatel> so i dunno.  you'd need to check out their FAQs
[11:02:52] <jop008> I evaluated a couple of IDEs this was the best to use
[11:03:13] <duch_kazatel> i would argue that you don't need an IDE, but okay.
[11:03:22] <duch_kazatel> whatever works for you.
[11:05:10] <neredsenvy> I have a select box to which I can manually add <option> tags now I wan't to have double click on the <option> tags if double clicked on the one that was double clicked should be removed     $('option').dblclick(function(){       $('option', this).remove();     }); does not work
[11:05:14] <neredsenvy> damn it
[11:05:23] <duch_kazatel> nerd wut.
[11:05:34] <duch_kazatel> neredsenvy
[11:06:17] <neredsenvy> duch_kazatel: I have a select box with <option> tags. Now when I double click on one of the tags I wan't it removed
[11:06:37] <decx> $('option',this) looks for an option element in an option element
[11:06:42] <duch_kazatel> don't select boxes close when you click an option.
[11:08:16] <neredsenvy> no
[11:08:26] <vexati0n> i have an xmlhttprequest function with a timeout. when the timeout is reached, the error text is displayed, but i cannot make any subsequent requests (xhr or otherwise) to the server for another minute or so without the server timing out.
[11:08:27] <duch_kazatel> oh multiselect?
[11:08:34] <neredsenvy> duch_kazatel: Yes
[11:11:04] <neredsenvy> Odd still not working
[11:11:38] <neredsenvy> Um if I have $('option', this).remove(); alone does not work either.
[11:11:54] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ neredsenvy
[11:11:55] <b-ot> neredsenvy: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:16:52] <neredsenvy> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/mrNHc/
[11:17:29] <neredsenvy> Odd seems to work in js fiddle
[11:18:03] <duch_kazatel> any console errors?
[11:18:23] <neredsenvy> nope
[11:18:54] <jaspertheghost> http://staging.jjlprocess.com/ts/test-status2.html  im having an issue appending to the tbody of this table any one have any ideas?
[11:18:54] <jaspertheghost> http://staging.jjlprocess.com/ts/test-status2.html
[11:20:38] <duch_kazatel> $("#list > tbody:last").find('tbody').append(rows);
[11:20:44] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make sense.
[11:20:58] <duch_kazatel> just do $('#list tbody').append(rows)
[11:21:13] <Cork> duch_kazatel: nested tables?
[11:21:27] <jaspertheghost> no go on that as well :(
[11:21:43] <duch_kazatel> tables aren't nested.
[11:21:54] <jaspertheghost> i dont understand
[11:21:54] <duch_kazatel> #list tbody is a thing.
[11:22:34] <jaspertheghost> i added that .. i even made a simple table .. seems the append isnt working or its notr freshing
[11:22:36] <jaspertheghost> i get no errors
[11:23:59] <duch_kazatel> oh and it's window.onload = funcName;
[11:24:01] <neredsenvy> duch_kazatel: Found the problem can you maybe help me solve it. http://jsfiddle.net/mrNHc/2/ My complete code basically when the page loads the <select></select> is empty and <option> tags are added if required like shown in my example how do I make my  $('option')... work for the elements that were added manually ?
[11:24:02] <duch_kazatel> no parens after.
[11:24:15] <duch_kazatel> neredsenvy event delegation.
[11:24:31] <duch_kazatel> check out $(parent).on('event', 'target', function() {});
[11:25:47] <neredsenvy> so basically $('select').on('dblclick', 'option', function() { $(this).remove() });
[11:25:55] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[11:26:41] <neredsenvy> Woo hoo it works : ))
[11:26:44] <neredsenvy> thanks a lot
[11:27:06] <jaspertheghost> http://staging.jjlprocess.com/ts/test-status2.html  can u take a look at modifed code i have a simple #list1 table im trying to do a directappend to and its not working
[11:27:41] <duch_kazatel> jaspertheghost again, drop the parens after the function name.
[11:27:42] <duch_kazatel> window.onload = populate();
[11:27:53] <duch_kazatel> should be window.onload = populate;
[11:28:05] <jaspertheghost> ok ... i mean it works with it that as the alert files
[11:28:12] <jaspertheghost> alert fires*
[11:28:27] <duch_kazatel> right, and it isn't waiting for the onload event to fire.
[11:28:34] <duch_kazatel> that's running the code immediately.
[11:28:49] <duch_kazatel> and is assigning the onload to whatever that function returns.
[11:28:53] <duch_kazatel> not what you want.
[11:28:57] <jaspertheghost> oh shit so i should add () add teh end of functions like thjat?
[11:29:04] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:29:06] <jaspertheghost> could you explain that part in more deail i didnt know
[11:29:13] <jaspertheghost> removing the () at the end of populate
[11:29:18] <duch_kazatel> in this case, yes.
[11:29:40] <duch_kazatel> because window.onload call that function for you - it adds the parens for you, basically.
[11:29:43] <duch_kazatel> but not always.
[11:29:51] <duch_kazatel> if you're writing code and want to call a function, keep the parens.
[11:30:04] <jaspertheghost> so with onload never use the ()?
[11:30:07] <jaspertheghost> when would i want to?
[11:30:18] <duch_kazatel> when you're returning a function that you want to run instead.
[11:30:23] <duch_kazatel> hint: rarely, if ever.
[11:30:36] <duch_kazatel> at least, not when you're learning.
[11:37:01] <jaspertheghost> so var x = window.onload = somefunction();   ?
[11:37:08] <jaspertheghost> idk think thats valid*
[11:38:13] <BillCriswell> One step forward, two steps back.
[11:39:15] <jaspertheghost> sometunction() that returna a function   like window.onload = something();  something = function () { stuff } ;
[11:39:17] <BlackHorn> Is anyone here familiar with jcarousel?
[11:39:19] <duch_kazatel> no.
[11:39:19] <jaspertheghost> ??
[11:39:30] <duch_kazatel> window.onload = somefunction;
[11:39:34] <duch_kazatel> that's it.
[11:39:45] <duch_kazatel> don't worry about functions that return functions.
[11:39:51] <duch_kazatel> ignore that part for now.
[11:39:54] <jaspertheghost> ok
[11:40:01] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ BlackHorn
[11:40:01] <b-ot> BlackHorn: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:40:49] <BlackHorn> so, no one is familiar with the jcarousel?
[11:40:57] <duch_kazatel> BlackHorn ... just ask your question yo.
[11:41:01] <BlackHorn> just need some help trying to sort out something with it. :P
[11:41:42] <duch_kazatel> awesome - create a fiddle and ask away!
[11:48:25] <BlackHorn> is no one familiar with jcarousel here?
[11:49:30] <duch_kazatel> why are you ignoring my advice?
[11:50:03] <duch_kazatel> BlackHorn just ask your question.
[11:54:59] <Cork> BlackShe1p: you won't get any help unless you ask the question
[11:55:05] <duch_kazatel> he left
[11:55:12] <Cork> ah missed that
[11:55:12] <duch_kazatel> he did the same thin in ##javascript.
[11:57:05] <jaspertheghost> duch but doing  var x = somefunction();  thats still correct right?
[11:57:38] <Cork> jasperdegroot: when you add (); you execute the function
[11:57:46] <Cork> without it you pass the function as a reference
[11:57:53] <duch_kazatel> jasperdegroot no.
[11:58:02] <duch_kazatel> remove the () at the end.
[11:58:11] <jasperdegroot> someone looking for me?
[11:58:17] <Cork> so when you want something to hold a reference to the function so it can call it you need to remove the ()
[11:58:23] <Cork> ugg...
[11:58:26] <Cork> jasperdegroot: sorry
[11:58:27] <duch_kazatel> woah wtf usernames.
[11:58:29] <Cork> too close
[11:58:36] <jasperdegroot> :)
[11:58:42] <duch_kazatel> we're talking to jaspertheghost D:
[11:59:03] <jasperdegroot> yeah, I see that now :D
[11:59:05] <duch_kazatel> jaspertheghost when you var x = somefunction(); you're assigning x to whatever somefunction() returns
[11:59:17] <jaspertheghost> duch thats what what i wanted
[11:59:24] <duch_kazatel> in that case, yes.
[11:59:28] <jaspertheghost> ok i see window.onload needs the name of the function
[11:59:29] <duch_kazatel> not in the onload deal.
[11:59:34] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[12:00:16] <Cork> jaspertheghost: var x = somefunction; window.onload = x; window.onload(); :D
[12:00:20] <jaspertheghost> window.load is a variable that JS reads when page is loaded and does a callback
[12:00:56] <duch_kazatel> window.onload is an object that gets called at a function when the page finishes loading.
[12:01:19] <jaspertheghost> ahhh
[12:01:23] <jaspertheghost> understood :)
[12:01:44] <jaspertheghost> im wondering how then my other code was working with window.onload = something();
[12:01:50] <jaspertheghost> cause it was lol
[12:02:01] <duch_kazatel> because you were beating the race condition magically.
[12:02:13] <jaspertheghost> lol
[12:02:26] <jaspertheghost> so i got lucky?
[12:02:29] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[12:03:15] <jaspertheghost> it was a pretty intensive function though
[12:03:15] <jaspertheghost> loading a list etc from ajax
[12:03:31] <duch_kazatel> did the function rely on anything else in the apge?
[12:03:33] <duch_kazatel> *page
[12:04:26] <jaspertheghost> it populated a UL LI from ajax data ( in the function was the ajax call and rthe loop that populates the ul li
[12:04:58] <jaspertheghost> actually i think i moved the code so that the function itself called another function()
[12:05:10] <jaspertheghost> so it prolly returned really quickly...
[12:05:13] <duch_kazatel> that means the ajax saved you.
[12:05:31] <duch_kazatel> because the append wasn't happening until after the page had loaded.
[12:06:16] <jaspertheghost> indeed
[12:11:58] <AnTi_MTtr> anyone remember what the coolest jquery parallax lib is?
[12:12:08] <AnTi_MTtr> i found a really good one the other day now i cant remmeber what its called
[12:12:15] <darcyclarke> skrollr
[12:13:09] <AnTi_MTtr> yes!
[12:13:11] <AnTi_MTtr> that was it, thanks
[12:13:56] <duch_kazatel> parallax lol
[12:23:31] <jaspertheghost> how can i place a border around a <tr>
[12:24:24] <duch_kazatel> you can't, technically.
[12:24:32] <jaspertheghost> they did it here
[12:24:33] <jaspertheghost> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/670424/border-around-specific-rows-in-a-table
[12:25:02] <duch_kazatel> interestring.  wonder when that changed.
[12:25:23] <jaspertheghost> border-collapse: collapse;
[12:25:37] <duch_kazatel> i can read yo.
[12:25:39] <Cork> jaspertheghost: borders from tr normally propagate to the td elements
[12:25:51] <Cork> tr isn't a visible element
[12:27:28] <jaspertheghost> http://staging.jjlprocess.com/ts/test-status2.html  now i just gota figure out what happened to the right border
[12:27:40] <duch_kazatel> kill that window alert pls
[12:28:41] <Cork> duch_kazatel: you don't like dead kittens?
[12:28:43] <Cork> :D
[12:28:47] <duch_kazatel> D:
[12:29:06] <Cork> a kitten dies every time you use alerts for debugging
[12:29:12] <duch_kazatel> yeah./
[12:29:16] <duch_kazatel> they're awful.
[12:29:17] <jaspertheghost> lot of dead kittens
[12:29:42] <duch_kazatel> use console.log() is a good thing.
[12:29:49] <Ownix> better way to do this? .children('a').first().children('h1').first();
[12:30:10] <duch_kazatel> .find('a h1').first() maybe?
[12:30:33] <Cork> or .find('> a > h1').first():
[12:31:00] <duch_kazatel> or add a class to the thing you want.
[12:31:04] * Cork nods
[12:31:12] <jaspertheghost> anyone any idea about this border not working on the right hand side lol
[12:31:19] <duch_kazatel> or throw your computer out the window
[12:31:22] <Cork> jaspertheghost: it works here
[12:31:26] <jaspertheghost> ^^ always an option
[12:31:53] <duch_kazatel> what border?
[12:31:58] <jaspertheghost> around the header
[12:32:02] <jaspertheghost> it doesnt work in chrome or android
[12:32:06] <jaspertheghost> only firefox it seems
[12:32:23] <Cork> jaspertheghost: ah, mobile
[12:32:29] <Cork> you need to say that
[12:32:31] <duch_kazatel> and chrome.
[12:32:34] <jaspertheghost> and chrome*
[12:32:37] <duch_kazatel> broken in chrome for me.
[12:32:45] <Cork> desktop browsers works just fine here

[12:37:12] <duch_kazatel> reported attack page...
[12:37:23] <duch_kazatel> strange
[12:37:37] <Cork> hmm
[12:37:38] <jaspertheghost> i get those 2 from time to time
[12:37:43] * Cork picks a different image host
[12:37:44] <jaspertheghost> is it BS or what?
[12:38:03] <AnTi_MTtr> so many images, so little hosts
[12:38:05] <duch_kazatel> i gotta go to lunch.  enjoy.
[12:38:59] <jaspertheghost> my hack is to put a right border on the last column
[12:38:59] <jaspertheghost> haha
[12:44:05] <str8uplinux> can someone tell me what i'm missing? i'm trying to get the ID of the next hidden input: 67.55.169.1
[12:44:17] <str8uplinux> opps http://jsfiddle.net/H8EVE/1/
[12:44:31] <zizzl> Hey guys just trying to create a submenu that shows on hover but when you hover away there's a half second delay... tried this http://jsfiddle.net/6phz5/ but no luck, can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong?
[12:44:44] <str8uplinux> you can ignore that pasted IP address, i meant to paste the link
[12:46:17] <Cork> duch_lunch: http://i.imgur.com/vJCeefk.png there :)
[12:46:29] <jaspertheghost> $(this) is the button
[12:46:36] <jaspertheghost> the next inout hidden isnt after the button
[12:46:39] <jaspertheghost> its before it
[12:47:04] <hcker2000> can you do some thing like jquery_object.filter('[value="2"]') ?
[12:47:46] <Cork> str8uplinux: you want .prevAll('input:hidden')
[12:48:04] <Cork> hcker2000: ye, BUT the value won't be the user input
[12:48:29] <Cork> you need .filter(function() { return $(this).val() == 2; });
[12:49:11] <zizzl> anyone?
[12:49:16] <hcker2000> right it would be the object that was found that has a value of 2
[12:49:36] <Cork> hcker2000: .filter is for dom elements, not objects
[12:49:51] <Cork> or array
[12:49:57] <Cork> for arrays you have $.grep
[12:50:05] <hcker2000> Cork, does it return a jquery object?
[12:50:22] <Cork> hcker2000: yes
[12:50:34] <Cork> .filter that is
[12:50:39] <Cork> $.grep returns a new array
[12:51:02] <hcker2000> Cork, so assuming route_options is a jquery object full of <option> node route_options.filter('[value="' + current_marker.route_id + '"]').prop('selected', true);
[12:51:22] <Cork> ah option elements
[12:51:22] <hcker2000> that would basically find the option with my specified value and set its selected value to true
[12:51:35] <Cork> the ya, filter('[value="2"]') should work
[12:51:49] <hcker2000> I'm getting weird results with it now
[12:52:00] <hcker2000> like now my output is no longer a select its just text
[12:52:13] <hcker2000> does filter permenantly remove the other object?
[12:52:17] <hcker2000> perhaps I just want a find
[12:52:19] <Cork> hcker2000: make a jsfiddle demo
[12:52:42] <hcker2000> one sec let me bang at it a second and see what comes of it
[12:53:08] <hcker2000> never mind
[12:53:14] <hcker2000> i shifted variable names and missed one
[12:56:12] <hcker2000> there we go
[12:56:28] <hcker2000> i hate dealing with selects and trying to change there selected states based on data
[12:56:52] <Cork> hcker2000: well i think your over working it
[12:57:02] <Cork> $('select').val(2) should do what you want
[12:57:26] <sunbeam> Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at example.com. This can be fixed by moving the resource to the same domain or enabling CORS.
[12:57:38] <zizzl> Hey guys I have a menu with a full width submenu on hover, I need to set a delay for the submenu disappearing because people are leaving the <li> to get to the submenu and its disappearing if they don't go directly down.. any ideas? This didn't work http://jsfiddle.net/6phz5/
[12:57:40] <sunbeam> how can I fix this (note that I cannot move to the target domain)
[12:58:05] <Cork> sunbeam: proxy it over your own domain, or reconfigure the server on the target to allow cors
[12:58:36] <Cork> sunbeam: there isn't anything you can do from your domain
[12:59:43] <Cork> sunbeam: use mouseenter/mouseleave instead of hover
[12:59:51] <Cork> and you shoudn't need the delay
[13:00:09] <sunbeam> Cork: ok, so what you say is, as long as I don't have access to the domain I am sending the $.ajax call to, i cannot do anything about this.
[13:00:37] <Cork> sunbeam: unless you configure the browser to allow xss
[13:00:56] <sunbeam> Cork: yes, but i cannot do this for 10k visitors :)
[13:01:07] <Cork> exactly
[13:01:31] <Cork> sunbeam: cors is to allow the target server to tell the browser "it is ok, i can handle the xss"
[13:01:46] <Cork> the block is to not leak passwords, and other sensitive user data
[13:02:18] <sunbeam> Cork: so there is nothing i can do on my server to handle this
[13:02:44] <Cork> sunbeam: you can set up a proxy, so you send the call to you, and then your server forwards it to the third party
[13:02:50] <Cork> other then that; no you can't
[13:03:04] <Cork> you can't from the site tell the browser to ignore it
[13:03:09] <Cork> that would be a security hole
[13:03:13] <sunbeam> ok got that
[13:03:21] <sunbeam> setting up a proxy, any example how that would work?
[13:04:12] <Cork> sunbeam: simplest form would be something like <?php echo file_get_content($_GET['q']); ?>
[13:05:25] <Cork> sunbeam: and from there you get go to nginx reverse proxy or so on
[13:05:48] <Cork> so basically you need something to make the call and then send the data from a domain you control
[13:06:16] <Cork> the reason behind this is that the cookie would not be related to the visitor
[13:06:20] <Cork> so no xss risk
[13:06:31] <sunbeam> the second you mean
[13:06:55] <Cork> sunbeam: the browser sends cookies related to the domain the request is for
[13:07:10] <Cork> sunbeam: and as the domain isn't the target you can't access there cookie session
[13:07:19] <zizzl> Anyone?
[13:07:49] <Cork> bah i sent it to the wring nick >_<
[13:07:59] <sunbeam> Cork: yep
[13:08:03] <Cork> zizzl: use mouseenter/mouseleave instead of hover | <Cork> and you shoudn't need the delay <-- this was for you
[13:09:00] <zizzl> cork, ok I'll try that, but why wouldn't I need the delay? People are hovering over the <li> then going to the left or right since it's a full width submenu instead of down, so they leave the <li> before going to the submenu
[13:09:15] <zizzl> shouldn't I have some kind of delay? since it'll trigger the mouseleave cork?
[13:09:30] <Cork> zizzl: the delay would not help
[13:09:45] <zizzl> Cork, ok yeah figured I had it wrong, what do you suggest?
[13:09:51] <Egahtrac> is there a way to trigger an event/function when someone closes the browser
[13:09:54] <Cork> zizzl: the enter/leave means you listen for mouse events on the tree
[13:09:59] <Cork> not just the event
[13:10:14] <Cork> Egahtrac: no you can't
[13:10:25] <Egahtrac> how about in a pop up window?
[13:10:27] <Cork> Egahtrac: the closest you can get is unload
[13:10:43] <Cork> Egahtrac: if you have opened the window with window.open, then yes you can
[13:11:06] <Egahtrac> yes so say i have a page
[13:11:12] <retep007> Hello I have small problem with jquery when I use remove() function element which I want to removed is removed, but when I use hide() function it doesn't work. Code is jQuery("#container .photo i.fa-times").click(function(){ 		jQuery(this).parent().hide(); 		console.log(jQuery(this).parent().hide()); 	});
[13:11:17] <Egahtrac> and you click a button in this page and it opens  a pop up window
[13:11:28] <Egahtrac> inside this pop up window are more buttons and things you can do
[13:11:34] <Egahtrac> and when you close this pop up window it will runa  function
[13:11:40] <Egahtrac> is that possible?
[13:12:24] <Cork> Egahtrac: haven't used popups much for ages, (like 10+ years)
[13:12:28] <Cork> so i'm a bit rusty
[13:12:32] <Cork> but i think you can ya
[13:12:33] <Egahtrac> well the idea is
[13:12:45] <Egahtrac> i'm making a game, when you click to attack someone i want a popup window to happen
[13:12:50] <Egahtrac> and you can attack/retreat inside the window
[13:13:04] <Egahtrac> and if you close the window it will also act like you are retreating from the attack and it will change db info
[13:13:12] <Cork> Egahtrac: you prob want to draw the popup in page instead
[13:13:25] <Cork> gives you a lot more control of what happens
[13:13:32] <Cork> (and looks, and positions and...)
[13:13:33] <retep007> @Egehtrac you can use append function
[13:13:54] <zizzl> Cork, so the mouseenter/mouseleave works but still disapears if the user leaves the <li>
[13:13:55] <Egahtrac> i see, i haven't tried drawing a popup on a page yet
[13:14:02] <Egahtrac> i'd have to research it
[13:14:06] <zizzl> disappears
[13:14:27] <Cork> zizzl: isn't the sub menu a child of the menu option parent?
[13:15:16] <zizzl> it is, but the <li> has little surface area and the submenu is full width, huge, so instead of navigation down, users tend to go to the left or right first to get to submenu items
[13:15:24] <zizzl> so I need some kind of delay on the mouseleave I think
[13:15:46] <Cork> zizzl: make some transparent element cover the gap
[13:16:08] <Cork> zizzl: sure you can solve this with js (not delay though)
[13:16:16] <Cork> but it is a real mess to maintain
[13:16:27] <Cork> as you need to track what element the user is moving to
[13:16:37] <Cork> and if it moves to the target you are about to hide
[13:16:48] <Cork> stop the hiding and instead bind an event listener on the target
[13:16:57] <Cork> so you can hide it if they leave it
[13:17:03] <Cork> and back again to the main menu
[13:17:10] <Cork> it becomes a mess really fast
[13:20:09] <mewm> I'm building a ProductList object, which holds a collection array of ProductItems. When I render the products, how worried should I be regarding performance on attaching mouseenter/mouseleave on each ProductItem?
[13:22:03] <Cork> mewm: except the dom will slow down as you add event listeners
[13:22:20] <Cork> there shouldn't any other problem with it
[13:22:40] <mewm> Cork: yes exactly... I'm just thinking how many is that? Like, before it slows down.
[13:22:49] <mewm> I just looking for a kind of magnitude
[13:23:02] <mewm> like a few, few houndred, even more?
[13:23:03] <Cork> mewm: it isn't number before it slows down
[13:23:14] <Cork> every event listener you add slows down the dom
[13:23:14] <mewm> No I know, not exactly.
[13:23:34] <Cork> the question is how much speed you can lose before it matters
[13:23:49] <mewm> Yes, thats obviously true. I'm more thinking when it's more noticable
[13:24:17] <Lucy_> hello! :)
[13:24:30] <Cork> mewm: also are you sure you need mouseenter? css :hover might work
[13:24:55] <Cork> and it doesn't have the overhead
[13:25:00] <mewm> I might just have to try it out... It's whether to limit and paginate the product list, and at treshhold
[13:25:41] <Lucy_> I have a serious problem with a toggle div for an on click event
[13:26:30] <mewm> Cork: I don't think it's adequate enough, as I have to switch out picures, and register new events inside the hovered parts for an even deeper hover.
[13:27:15] <mewm> More specifically, to activate a variant selection on hover, and inside, have various color squiares that each needs to swtich out the product image.
[13:27:32] <Cork> mewm: hmm if you need to add and remove event listeners as the user moves the mouse you are most likely doing something wrong
[13:27:46] <Lucy_> If I set a display: none for the hidden div (with inside an image with a map overlay) the image appears when I click to show the second one, but with incorrect width and height! ( I think that hiding my div firstly give some problems with the loading of the page
[13:28:27] <Cork> Lucy_: you need to make a jsfiddle demo
[13:29:21] <Lucy_> Cork this is the page: http://www.casadamarezanzibar.com/#overview
[13:29:39] <Lucy_> I don't know If I explain well what I'm trying to do
[13:30:43] <mewm> Cork: Hmm, I don't see any other way. Here is the problem: The product list contains products that will be lazyloaded in an (in)finite scroll. When the user hovers the product, a window outlines the product showing more properties of that specific clothing item. A few colored sqaures spawns in that window, which ressembles each colored variant this product has. When the user hovers those sqaures, the main image will switch out to the color
[13:30:43] <mewm>  accordingly.
[13:31:32] <mewm> Am I the only one, that is a bit annoyed (no offence) that a t highligts the user. Like, don't!
[13:31:36] <mewm> :P
[13:33:03] <Lucy_> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/5wnL9/
[13:51:57] <copperhands> i have a function that executes by id when clicked
[13:52:04] <copperhands> this is the function: $(function () {

[13:52:04] <copperhands> });
[13:52:04] <copperhands> shit sorry
[13:52:11] <copperhands> let me put it in a fiddle
[13:52:48] <copperhands> ok this is the function
[13:52:50] <copperhands> http://jsfiddle.net/dvkyh/
[13:53:19] <copperhands> if I put that javascript in a php page, what is the scope of that function? does it matter where the script is place or where the #b3 is located?
[13:53:38] <copperhands> *placed
[13:54:50] <PantsOfChocolate> sup team
[13:59:05] <PantsOfChocolate> i got a quick question anyone here?
[14:05:23] <nhulea_wed> copperhands: I dont think so
[14:06:20] <nhulea_wed> but without seeing what your doing completely there is no way to tell are you calling the php file you are putting the js in ?
[14:07:08] <nhulea_wed> PantsOfChocolate: #justaskthequestion
[14:07:28] <PantsOfChocolate> haha noone was here
[14:07:39] <PantsOfChocolate> http://jsfiddle.net/doktormolle/YsQdh/
[14:07:53] <PantsOfChocolate> whats the easiest way to json stringify a javascript object of polylines?
[14:09:24] <PantsOfChocolate> http://jsfiddle.net/doktormolle/YsQdh/
[14:09:30] <PantsOfChocolate> thats the one i meant
[14:13:56] <nhulea_wed> PantsOfChocolate: if you see the out put the console here http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/YsQdh/114/
[14:14:35] <nhulea_wed> you can pull out what parts of the object you want with dot notation and then create an array of all of them
[14:14:49] <nhulea_wed> or do you want it all ?
[14:15:34] <PantsOfChocolate> well im passing it back to django to store it
[14:15:34] <nhulea_wed> what part of the object to you want in json or do you want it all ?
[14:15:46] <nhulea_wed> what are you passing back ?
[14:15:49] <PantsOfChocolate> i mostly just need all the coordinates correct?
[14:15:51] <PantsOfChocolate> polyline
[14:17:52] <PantsOfChocolate> sorry if im not helpful this whole drawing on maps stuff is new territory for me
[14:19:20] <sunbeam> anyone has experience using whateverorigin?
[14:21:56] <copperhands> does javascript have something similar to phps OR DIE?
[14:23:58] <duch_lunch> so what?
[14:24:05] <duch_lunch> *to what?
[14:24:28] <copperhands> or die?
[14:24:39] <copperhands> | exit?
[14:25:44] <duch_lunch> you can return froma function.
[14:26:21] <duch_kazatel> not aware of anything that just kills a script (if i'm reading the php docs correctly)
[14:27:49] <copperhands> i want to test if a variable is a string or number and then give me a error if it's not
[14:28:23] <copperhands> i need to get rid of this error: Warning:  number_format() expects parameter 1 to be double, string given
[14:28:36] <nhulea_wed> PantsOfChocolate: maybe somethign like this http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/YsQdh/117/\
[14:28:50] <nhulea_wed> its getting all the point in an array
[14:29:22] <nhulea_wed> so you can make a object that contain all the points for each line ?
[14:30:12] <copperhands> nevermind
[14:30:16] <copperhands> alerts are awesome
[14:30:33] <duch_kazatel> console.log()
[14:31:52] <duch_kazatel> alerts are evil.
[14:33:05] <Cork> copperhands: alerts is really bad for debugging, cause they will reorder how things flow in the page
[14:33:14] <Cork> so you can get event called extra times
[14:33:29] <Cork> or code running in different orders then they would without it
[14:33:32] <Cork> and so on
[14:33:35] <Cork> (dead locks9
[14:33:51] <Cork> so ya, alerts is a really bad idea for debugging

[15:06:52] <duch_kazatel> you need to get rid of the dollar sign.
[15:08:39] <copperhands> sorry
[15:09:13] <copperhands> I just realized that.
[15:09:13] <copperhands> I think I ask questions sometimes when I should be googling.
[15:10:32] <copperhands> oh cool, now I understand console.log()
[15:10:34] <copperhands> thanks duch_kazatel
[15:14:50] <duch_kazatel> yep
[15:14:57] <duch_kazatel> also you could've just console.log() the typeof
[15:16:20] <duch_kazatel> and do thishttp://jsfiddle.net/dvkyh/5/
[15:44:01] <meowsus> With some pseudocode like this: https://gist.github.com/722e6dc52b3fa126e92b , Is there a way I can call the function expression I'm referencing on Line 9 AND pass a variable as a parameter to it, so it can be accessed on Line 5?
[15:46:40] <duch_kazatel> you indeed can
[15:46:41] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[15:46:58] <duch_kazatel> .on( "event", { foo: "bar" }, myHandler );
[15:47:33] <meowsus> Ohhhh
[15:47:41] <meowsus> The second param is an object
[15:47:47] <duch_kazatel> that's one way.
[15:47:50] * meowsus slaps himself with a large trout
[15:48:01] <duch_kazatel> if you put a selector there instead you get a delegated listener
[15:49:02] <meowsus> Ah ha!
[15:49:10] <meowsus> I should read moar documentation!~
[15:49:14] <meowsus> Thanks duch_kazatel
[15:49:19] <duch_kazatel> always.  and of course.
[15:57:37] <meowsus> duch_kazatel: what about this scenario: what if that function I want to pass more data to requires not only an object, but also the event from the mousemove.
[15:58:33] <meowsus> Whoops
[15:58:40] <meowsus> Everything gets passed through the event
[15:58:44] <meowsus> The object is in event.data
[15:58:47] <meowsus> (facepalm)
[15:59:44] <duch_kazatel> yep.

[16:27:36] <BlackHorn> anyone familiar with jcarousel here?
[16:30:41] <drej> sebastian_o| that site is weird
[16:30:49] <drej> i cant even see the author because its being overlapped
[16:31:56] <drej> although i guess tahts not important
[16:43:51] <sebastian_o|> I'm about to use that events in object thing, sounds awesome
[16:55:30] <sebastian_o|> pity it doesn't really work =/
[16:57:36] <sebastian_o|> mm works
[16:58:09] <sebastian_o|> ha in Arrays does not work
[16:58:17] <sebastian_o|> in pjos is okay
[17:00:27] <sebastian_o|> awesome
[17:04:09] <Rarikon> http://jsfiddle.net/RaithPayne/QxALr/ How can I get this simple function to repeat? It only cycles once.
[17:08:47] <__joshua___> what function?
[17:09:10] <Rarikon> The click fadeTo animation
[17:09:16] <Rarikon> It runs only once.
[17:10:25] <decx> you fadeTo 0 opacity, that means the initial show() will never work again
[17:10:44] <decx> well it works, but it doesnt matter
[17:10:53] <decx> because it's opacity 0, get it?
[17:11:08] <Rarikon> Uhh
[17:11:39] <Rarikon> So, I would set $(#copied).css(opacity:1;);?
[17:11:54] <decx> just use fadeOut instead of fadeTo
[17:12:12] <decx> i'm not gonna go on a rant about using classes with transitions instead because it's late
[17:12:26] <Rarikon> Okay.
[17:12:30] <Rarikon> Thanks.
[17:13:50] <decx> and don't move the element around on every mousemove that's ridiculous
[17:15:39] <Rarikon> But it follows the cursor as the primary point of the user's attention.
[17:15:48] <__joshua___> only move it when it is visible
[17:16:10] <Rarikon> I could do that, but wouldn't there be a delay after it activates?
[17:16:35] <Rarikon> So for 50ms the div would be located at the top left corner and then fly into the cursor.
[17:23:09] <__joshua___> you can keep the last mouse position at all times if you like
[17:23:20] <__joshua___> when the click happens, move the element to last_postion
[17:23:29] <__joshua___> or better yet
[17:23:32] <__joshua___> get the coords of the click event
[18:28:22] <Eviltechie> I'm looking for a dial chart, something similar to this http://www.engineeringradio.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/burk-auto-pilot.jpg
[19:01:22] <AnTi_MTtr> im in love

[19:02:16] <systemfault> Cool
[19:13:04] <BlackHorn> does anyone know anything about the jcarousel jquery script?
[20:02:25] <donni> is it okay to use bunch of inline script?
[20:05:06] <donni> hello
[20:19:19] <gonner> hey guys, i only really know php well, I am having trouble understanding callbacks, is there some equivalent in php?
[20:19:31] <gonner> or like conceptually similar
[20:35:24] <systemfault> gonner: Looks like you donâ€™t know PHP at all..
[20:35:39] <systemfault> Because PHP has callbacksâ€¦ it just doesnâ€™t have async functions.
[20:35:50] <systemfault> gonner: look at array_map for example.
[20:36:17] <gonner> sorry thats wrong
[20:36:20] <gonner> read some more books
[20:36:29] <systemfault> Oh :)

[23:58:31] <FilipNortic> are there any good/easy way of disabling anchor tags?
[23:58:51] <Cork> FilipNortic: there is really only one
[23:59:13] <FilipNortic> rebind click?
[23:59:33] <Cork> FilipNortic: you want to disable existing event handlers?
[23:59:41] <FilipNortic> yes
[23:59:55] <Cork> have them check for an attribute on the element
