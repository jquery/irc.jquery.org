[00:00:05] <gavin_huang> coldhead, panic! not working in ff3.6 http://jsfiddle.net/VrHHM/2/
[00:00:31] <gavin_huang> coldhead, i changed 1.6 to 1.6.1
[00:03:20] <gavin_huang> coldhead, ff3.6.17 under linux to be specific. seems to be fine in chrome dev
[00:04:50] <iszak> gavin_huang, property?
[00:05:32] <iszak> gavin_huang, maybe use .is('[required]')
[00:06:14] <innociv> is $.ajax({type:"POST",data:data: "userid=" + curUser.id + '&topicid=' + topic_id + '&text='+$post.find('textarea').html()}) the same as having data: {"userid":curUser.id, "topicid":topic_id, "text":$post.find('textarea').html()} ?
[00:06:15] <iszak> is required even a valid attribute?
[00:06:26] <gavin_huang> iszak, yeah. that works. thanks.
[00:06:44] <gavin_huang> iszak, it is. a html5 attr for inputs
[00:07:00] <iszak> gavin_huang, ah right, didn't know that, thanks, what solved it .prop() or .is()
[00:07:04] <iszak> try prop()
[00:07:26] <gavin_huang> iszak, tried, same thing.
[00:07:40] <iszak> hmm alright
[00:07:44] <iszak> ?source prop
[00:07:44] <bot-t> Line#2595 - "prop = this.props[ --i ];" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#2595
[00:08:04] <iszak> sigh, bot-t.com is down temp01 ping
[00:08:38] <coldhead> temp01 is down too
[00:08:49] <iszak> coldhead, really?
[00:09:11] <coldhead> yeah
[00:09:21] <iszak> hmm okay
[00:09:25] <coldhead> he or she is got some crazy crap going down IRL
[00:09:30] <gavin_huang> coldhead, should i fire a bug for it?
[00:09:43] <iszak> s/fire/file/
[00:10:05] <coldhead> gavin_huang: i'm just trying to decide that. can you try with some older versions of jQuery and see when it breaks?
[00:10:19] <coldhead> attr() was changed in in1.6 and changed again in 1.6.1
[00:10:21] <Tobsn> anyone of you guys use jquery template?
[00:10:38] <coldhead> and only timmywil knows what the fuck is going on
[00:10:39] <iszak> coldhead++ you know your shiz
[00:10:52] <gavin_huang> coldhead, 1.6 works. so i guess it starts from 1.6.1. trying old versions now...
[00:11:14] <coldhead> i just tried 1.6.2rc2 and its still borked in fx on linux
[00:12:06] <iszak> coldhead, how's ruby going? I'm kind of jealous that you have time to learn ruby.
[00:12:58] <coldhead> well i'm making the most of the time while i have it :)
[00:13:13] <coldhead> its very elegant and enjoyable
[00:13:15] <iszak> coldhead, it doesn't have to end, get a ruby job!
[00:13:33] <coldhead> yeah, i'd love to
[00:13:47] <coldhead> having said that i've been programming in scheme all day
[00:14:16] <iszak> god you're all over the place!
[00:14:19] <coldhead> but tomorrow i'll dedicate to jRuby
[00:14:20] <iszak> choose a language and make love to it
[00:14:21] <coldhead> hahaha
[00:14:56] <coldhead> the only language i have ever used exclusively was perl
[00:15:04] <gavin_huang> coldhead, just wondering, are you the same person as cloudhead?
[00:15:04] <coldhead> and i haven't used any perl for years
[00:15:14] <iszak> coldhead, that's good, perl is ick
[00:15:19] <coldhead> no gavin_huang, that guy is much awesomer than me
[00:15:40] <gavin_huang> coldhead, pretty sure it starts from 1.6.1 old versions are fine.
[00:15:43] <iszak> that was unexpected
[00:15:45] <coldhead> grr eir
[00:17:53] <coldhead> gavin_huang: http://ejohn.org/blog/jquery-16-and-attr/
[00:18:13] <gavin_huang> coldhead, you seem pretty cool also. have seen you many times helping others in this channel. :)
[00:18:30] <iszak> gavin_huang, it's his first day too
[00:19:04] <gavin_huang> iszak, first day for what?
[00:19:30] <iszak> gavin_huang, jquery
[00:19:38] <iszak> this is his first day using jquery
[00:19:53] <gavin_huang> iszak, lol
[00:19:54] <coldhead> that post seems to say that attr() is all fixed and static now
[00:20:13] <coldhead> so i just don't know what to believe
[00:20:26] <gavin_huang> coldhead, if that's the case. we are doomed i guess.
[00:21:14] <gavin_huang> coldhead, but fixing it more like a bug fix than a api adjustment.
[00:21:24] <gavin_huang> *an api adjustment
[00:21:40] <coldhead> but the bug arises because of an API adjustment
[00:22:31] <coldhead> we should run the test suite on 1.6.2 rc 2 in the offending firefox
[00:22:58] <gavin_huang> coldhead, agreed.
[00:23:53] <coldhead> i was hoping you would do it, instead of just agreeing that someone would
[00:24:13] <gavin_huang> coldhead, oh, sure.
[00:25:40] <gavin_huang> coldhead, does the "bug" have a test case in 1.6.2 rc 2?
[00:26:03] <coldhead> that's what we need to figure out
[00:26:05] <coldhead> i would assume so
[00:26:19] <coldhead> i'm hoping it some tests will fail in that browser
[00:26:29] <coldhead> s/it//
[00:26:35] <coldhead> and then you can file it
[00:27:36] <gavin_huang> coldhead, finally got something to contribute.
[00:28:43] <^zoggy^> 1.6.1 deff introduced a lot of attr things that had to be updated, was not backwards compatable for me
[00:28:54] <coldhead> http://swarm.jquery.org/git/jquery/test/
[00:29:12] <coldhead> that seems to test off the latest version on github
[00:29:12] <^zoggy^> $('#'+$('#whichDefaultRootDir').val()).attr('selected', 'selected')
[00:29:15] <^zoggy^> had to turn into
[00:29:18] <coldhead> see how the evil firefox goes there
[00:29:21] <^zoggy^> $('#'+$('#whichDefaultRootDir').val()).prop("selected", true)
[00:29:24] <^zoggy^> for example
[00:29:40] <djQuery> coldhead: http://which-should-i-use.ossreleasefeed.com/
[00:29:49] <coldhead> god there is a fantastic amount broken for me there
[00:30:40] <iszak> well it is a rc
[00:31:08] <coldhead> they shouldn't be commiting stuff that doesn't pass the unit tests
[00:31:23] <iszak> flaws happen
[00:31:26] <coldhead> i am inclined to suspect this is some old set of tests running
[00:31:41] <coldhead> they're probably passing the test suite that comes with jQuery
[00:31:48] <coldhead> but i'm not set up to compile it here
[00:32:01] <iszak> yeah I'd say so
[00:32:45] <coldhead> gavin_huang: if you have the patience, talk to gnarf or timmywil or ajpiano when they're around and see if they think you have a bug. and if you don't have the patience, file it anyway and wait to see it get marked wontfix >: |
[00:33:36] <gavin_huang> coldhead, ha. ok. i think i got what it takes to talk to these giants. :)
[00:34:18] <coldhead> they're only technically giants. socially they're awkward and they come from broken homes and circus families
[00:34:21] <coldhead> don't be intimidated
[00:34:30] <gavin_huang> coldhead, coldhead, two tests failed. none seems to relate to attr. one is # event: focusin bubbles (1, 0, 1) the other is selector: pseudo - misc (1, 18, 19)
[00:34:46] <coldhead> do they pass in chrome?
[00:35:56] <gavin_huang> coldhead, now i'm intimidated.
[00:36:11] <coldhead> guh the current github jQ breaks a billion times in my chromium
[00:36:16] <coldhead> i suspect i am cursed
[00:36:42] <gavin_huang> coldhead, tests hang on "Running support: proper boxModel in compatMode CSS1Compat (IE6 and IE7)" in chrome.
[00:36:43] <iszak> chromium nightly?
[00:37:06] <coldhead> no, chromium 80s flavour that this ubuntu release won't upgrade from
[00:37:35] <iszak> coldhead, so a ppa for chromium-stable ?
[00:37:46] <iszak> I'm running chromium-nightly
[00:37:51] <coldhead> yeah, ppa
[00:38:06] <coldhead> i don't have the bandwidth for a nightly at the moment
[00:38:10] <coldhead> sad story, bro
[00:38:15] <iszak> I ran the test suite in Chrome stable, and it errored, I suspect it's an old test suite.
[00:38:24] <iszak> coldhead, living off vodafone wireless?
[00:38:48] <coldhead> living off stolen wifi because some idiots cut our phone line
[00:39:04] <iszak> don't phone lines go under ground?
[00:39:25] <coldhead> some idiots with a diamond saw who were cutting the pavement*
[00:39:45] <ravenzz> nice
[00:39:46] <ravenzz> :f
[00:40:00] <iszak> atleast it wasn't an old lady that cut the fibre optics cable to your country.
[00:40:31] <coldhead> that would be much more hilarious
[00:40:46] <coldhead> also that got fixed much quicker
[00:40:52] <coldhead> this has been out 10 days now
[00:41:05] <iszak> coldhead, http://www.geekologie.com/2011/04/old-lady-severs-fiberoptic-net.php
[00:42:09] <ravenzz> some idiots here tried to steal some telephone cables (to resell the copper you know). but that was fiber :f
[00:44:52] <coldhead> at least someone was trying to steal something!
[00:45:01] <coldhead> this was just incompetence
[00:46:45] <coldhead> i can't believe all these unit tests are failing
[00:46:49] <coldhead> i must be doing something wrong
[00:46:58] <coldhead> it is literally my first day using jQuery
[00:47:35] <sdkjsvcds> hii
[00:49:06] <Haprog> morning
[00:50:12] <coldhead> gavin_huang: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9504
[00:50:21] <coldhead> i give up for now :)
[00:52:23] <gavin_huang> coldhead, oh, it's a known bug. I should have googled first.
[00:53:02] <coldhead> i'm not sure
[00:53:14] <coldhead> that seems to say it shouldn't work in IE
[00:53:18] <coldhead> we're not talking about IE
[00:53:23] <coldhead> THEN ALL THOSE UNIT TESTS FAILED
[00:53:30] <coldhead> SOMEONE PLEASE HOLD ME
[00:53:36] <coldhead> i'm taking a poetry break
[00:53:38] <coldhead> good luck
[01:04:05] <fabiobik> $("#jquery").write("HELLO");
[01:04:09] <fabiobik> :)
[01:04:44] <Giverny> :O
[01:05:13] <fabiobik> does anyone here wanna teach me how to deal with ajax?
[01:05:43] <fabiobik> ive seen the documentation but i still not understand
[01:07:12] <coldhead> can you pastebin the code you don't unnerstan, fabiobik ?
[01:07:36] <fabiobik> coldhead i dont understand how to process
[01:07:52] <fabiobik> coldhead im asking here for examples
[01:08:40] <fabiobik> coldhead i want to process an  form
[01:08:46] <fabiobik> with POST method
[01:09:23] <fabiobik> and recieve the result
[01:09:44] <coldhead> the simplest way is to use the ajaxform plugin
[01:09:50] <gnarf> coldhead: sup?
[01:09:58] <coldhead> which makes a regular form work via ajax
[01:10:14] <coldhead> fabiobik: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[01:10:17] <Giverny> coldhead he want a jquery not plugin
[01:10:19] <Giverny> ;/
[01:10:22] <Giverny> plugin blergh
[01:10:35] <coldhead> well YOU help him then, Giverny
[01:10:37] <coldhead> :)
[01:10:51] <coldhead> gnarf: someone was asking about templates but i don't know if he cares anymore
[01:11:33] <coldhead> gnarf: also gavin_huang was wondering about a bug in attr() but i got sidetracked in that a bunch of unit tests seem to be failing in the latest jQuery from github and am i doing something stupid?
[01:11:47] <Giverny> coldhead ¬¬
[01:11:50] <fabiobik> yah i want jquery
[01:11:53] <gnarf> coldhead: which browser?
[01:12:10] <fabiobik> .ajax()
[01:12:16] <coldhead> for me, some chromium on linux and some firefox on linux
[01:12:22] <coldhead> it doesn't seem to matter
[01:12:31] <gnarf> coldhead: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1300/
[01:12:32] <gavin_huang> gnarf, i've added the test case coldhead created to http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9504
[01:13:00] <coldhead> ah this is brilliant, thanks gnarf
[01:13:08] <coldhead> i don't know diddly about swarm
[01:13:44] <coldhead> gnarf: would love to know what you make of gavin's bug then
[01:14:43] <gnarf> coldhead: one of the reasons I hate the boolhook
[01:15:12] <Giverny> fabiobik
[01:15:19] <fabiobik> yep
[01:15:32] <gnarf> gavin_huang: this issue appears in which browsers?
[01:15:43] <fabiobik> Giverny
[01:16:06] <gavin_huang> gnarf, for me, it's ff3.6.17 under linux
[01:16:10] <Giverny> fabiobik http://pastebin.com/nXnKGQh8
[01:16:36] <gavin_huang> gnarf, works fine in chrome dev
[01:16:53] <gnarf> gavin_huang: http://jsfiddle.net/VrHHM/5/
[01:16:58] <gnarf> run that in your browser
[01:17:01] <gnarf> give me the console.log output?
[01:17:23] <gavin_huang> gnarf, sure, wait a sec..
[01:17:30] <gnarf> jQuery 1.6.1 I assume ?
[01:17:53] <gavin_huang> gnarf, yes
[01:18:16] <gavin_huang> gnarf, line: 1 ["required", undefined, undefined]
[01:18:26] <gavin_huang> gnarf, line 2: ["", undefined, undefined]
[01:18:27] <fabiobik> Giverny thank you
[01:18:46] <gnarf> gavin_huang: http://jsfiddle.net/VrHHM/6/ ?
[01:18:52] <coldhead> fabiobik: http://jsfiddle.net/v23Kb/ // commented example
[01:19:25] <gavin_huang> gnarf, ["required", "required", undefined] && ["", "", undefined]
[01:19:40] <gnarf> gavin_huang: $.attrHooks[ "required" ] = {}
[01:19:42] <gnarf> thats the fix
[01:19:45] <fabiobik> Giverny i want to recieve the callback of php page of process form
[01:20:20] <Giverny> fabiobik put a page.php
[01:20:32] <fabiobik> were
[01:20:38] <fabiobik> on sucess:
[01:20:47] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/VrHHM/7/ gavin_huang?
[01:20:48] <gavin_huang> gnarf, impressive. will it be incorporated into core?
[01:20:53] <gnarf> gavin_huang: no it wont
[01:21:06] <Giverny> fabiobik http://pastebin.com/HaJaWUmp
[01:21:07] <gnarf> gavin_huang: you are disabling the boolHook for required
[01:21:18] <gnarf> gavin_huang: i have no clue if they plan on fixing that one for now
[01:21:33] <gavin_huang> gnarf, ["required", "required", undefined] && ["", "", undefined] && [null, undefined, undefined]
[01:21:40] <fabiobik> Geverny that dont explain nothing
[01:21:52] <gnarf> gavin_huang: the only issue you have there is "" should be a truthy value
[01:23:01] <gnarf> and well, it isn't
[01:23:23] <gavin_huang> gnarf, iszak suggests is('[required]'), and it seems to work.
[01:23:43] <coldhead> much thanks gnarf
[01:23:44] <gnarf> gavin_huang: thats a decent one
[01:24:17] <gnarf> gavin_huang: although I think you might get slightly faster perf out of .attr() -- but the [required] should do its job
[01:25:33] <gavin_huang> gnarf, thanks. haven't checked the api for attrHooks. Will give it a look. :)
[01:26:13] <gnarf> gavin_huang: its kinda messy with the bools
[01:28:25] <gnarf> gavin_huang / coldhead: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9504#comment:4
[01:30:34] <coldhead> gnarf: is attr() "fixed" now then?
[01:30:48] <coldhead> this behaviour is expected and 1.6.2 won't be any different?
[01:30:54] <gnarf> attr() is a fn mess in 1.6 IMO - but they claim it to be "fixed"
[01:31:10] <coldhead> i keep getting burned by it
[01:31:23] <coldhead> i just don't know what to tell people in gav's position
[01:31:28] <gnarf> it was a great idea, and we shoulda stuck to our guns
[01:31:31] <Giverny> what a fuck
[01:31:36] <coldhead> "use prototype"
[01:31:53] <Giverny> fabiobik don´t understand the example
[01:31:54] <Giverny> =\
[01:32:09] <gnarf> if we hadn't monkey patched attr() to boolHook for rboolean = /^(?:autofocus|autoplay|async|checked|controls|defer|disabled|hidden|loop|multiple|open|readonly|required|scoped|selected)$/i he wouldn't have this issue :)
[01:32:23] <gnarf> of course, there would still be piles of broken code
[01:32:54] <fabiobik> Giverny maybe you dont understanding what i need
[01:33:14] <fabiobik> Giverny i want on sucess:  recieve the response from the php
[01:34:29] <Giverny> fabiobik do u know object literals?
[01:34:35] <Giverny> in js?
[01:34:42] <coldhead> it's demonstrated in my example, fabiobik
[01:34:45] <fabiobik> nope
[01:34:52] <Giverny> :(
[01:35:27] <macheleon> coldhead: I've been thinking about that UX thing involving nested modals
[01:35:32] <fabiobik> Giverny you have this on sucess
[01:35:33] <fabiobik> success: function(){
[01:35:33] <fabiobik> 5.    $(this).addClass("done");
[01:35:33] <fabiobik> 6.  }
[01:35:56] <coldhead> what's the latest, macheleon ?
[01:35:57] <Giverny> success is a method
[01:36:05] <macheleon> it's that's bad UX, then a whole pile of stuff in operating systems and many programs is also bad UX
[01:36:15] <Giverny> do u understand method fabiobik ?
[01:36:20] <fabiobik> yes
[01:36:22] <gnarf> fabiobik: the response from the server is the first argument to the success function
[01:36:38] <fabiobik> yep
[01:36:41] <fabiobik> and is there?
[01:36:43] <coldhead> that's true, macheleon
[01:37:01] <fabiobik> ResponseText right?
[01:37:02] <coldhead> modals open modals in a lot of ubuntu software and it bugs me
[01:37:14] <macheleon> ok cool, that's perhaps why I thought of doing it that way initially, because it was just so familiar and I was used to it
[01:37:29] <gnarf> fabiobik: whatever the fuck you want to call it, its your variable declaration...  success: function(data) { } is common tho
[01:37:38] <macheleon> by extension, many users would be used to it .. of course I'm not disagreeing with the call that it's bad though
[01:38:00] <coldhead> macheleon: if you really want to do it right twy it both/several ways and get some user testing
[01:38:04] <coldhead> try*
[01:38:50] <macheleon> yeah that'd be best, and in this case I can say that it wouldn't matter as much because it's an intranet with trained users
[01:38:54] <gnarf> macheleon: modal (by definition) excludes the possibility of executing another modal -- in fact, if you ever end up with 2 modals open in most OS'es its possible it freaks out
[01:38:59] <Giverny> fabiobik my english is not good man but you need learn about object literals
[01:39:01] <Giverny> in js
[01:39:02] <alexidoia> hello, can I ask question about jqtouch in here ?
[01:39:13] <fabiobik> Giverny whats your language?
[01:39:22] <gnarf> my old IRC client on my mac used to bug out and pop two modals occasionally and i'd have to force quit it
[01:39:26] <macheleon> gnarf: perhaps we should be using the term dialog, or similar?
[01:40:04] <Giverny> fabiobik pt_br
[01:40:17] <macheleon> example: in windows xp, open local area connection status and click properties, a second dialog pops
[01:40:44] <gnarf> alexidoia: you can, not sure how many jqtouch users there are here but we might be able to help anyway, especially if you provide a fiddle or something --- see ?ask
[01:40:44] <bot-t> alexidoia, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:41:01] <macheleon> anyway I wouldn't disagree with the experts, just trying to understand the reasoning
[01:41:07] <alexidoia> ok
[01:41:09] <alexidoia> how to create a slide effect without the user trigger a button, but after for example the download of some files, le process of geolocation finished etc...
[01:41:14] <gnarf> macheleon: the lan connection status is not modal
[01:41:22] <coldhead> macheleon: i think the fact that other apps use nested modals is more a sign that people don't do things well all the time, rather than that avoiding them is radical
[01:41:23] <gnarf> its just a dialog window
[01:41:48] <macheleon> yeah gnarf, that was why I questioned using that term
[01:41:52] <gnarf> it doesn't stop you from interacting with the application (which modal does)
[01:42:07] <gnarf> ?w modal
[01:42:09] <bot-t> gnarf, Modal - Modal may refer to: Modal (textile), Modal analysis, Modal bandwidth, Modal haplotype, Modal jazz, Modal logic, Modal matrix, Modal phenomena, Modal score, Modal verb http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal
[01:42:23] <gnarf> ?w modal window
[01:42:25] <bot-t> gnarf, Modal window - In user interface design, a modal window is a child window that requires users to interact with it before they can return to operating the parent application, thus preventing the workflow on the application main window. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window
[01:42:40] <macheleon> right. some dialogs prevent you from interacting with the parent dialog, but not the os
[01:42:42] <gnarf> if thats not what you meant, don't use "modal"
[01:42:57] <gnarf> macheleon: parent application window...
[01:45:48] <macheleon> ok that makes sense then. my original thoughts are the same though, there must be a pile of apps that haven't followed these guidelines
[01:46:28] <gnarf> macheleon: are you the UX police now?
[01:46:36] <macheleon> no? lol why would I be
[01:46:59] <macheleon> I'm learning something
[01:47:02] <gnarf> macheleon: just curious what other application designers have done has any impact on your decisions? :)
[01:47:04] <coldhead> there are, but you can be different!
[01:47:20] <macheleon> gnarf: nothing at all
[01:47:32] <coldhead> macheleon: do what snover/nimbu say is my golden UX rule
[01:47:34] <macheleon> noticing the world around me and how it works, it's a great thing
[01:47:57] <macheleon> yeah coldhead seems to be good advice
[01:47:59] <gnarf> macheleon: see if you can manage to get a save dialog to pop at the same time as a javascript alert() window --- maybe your os will let you still work with the browser ;)
[01:48:42] <macheleon> excellent, I'll check that
[01:49:01] <gnarf> of course, newer browsers don't really "modal" alert() windows
[01:49:05] <gnarf> they just stop javascript threads
[01:49:29] <coldhead> modals are the new <blink>
[01:49:43] <gnarf> so's your face? ;)
[01:49:57] <gnarf> <blink> </blink>
[01:50:02] <coldhead> it's true, i do blink
[01:50:25] <gnarf> i would hope so, otherwise you're eyes would be pretty useless i think
[01:52:40] <Aque0s> Hi All - There must be a better way for me to do this in jQuery that is more reliable: http://pastebin.com/iz7kJkP4 could someone suggest how?
[01:57:04] <coldhead> Aque0s: http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[01:57:21] <gnarf> strange question
[01:57:29] <Aque0s> thank you coldhead :)
[01:57:29] <gnarf> anyone know if IE supports having multiple "filter" properties?
[01:59:45] <Fretta> I am trying to observe a form field, how can I act on this form field if it changes in jQuery?
[02:00:44] <coldhead> ?change @ Fretta
[02:00:44] <bot-t> Fretta, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[02:00:59] <Fretta> coldhead thanks :)
[02:01:03] <coldhead> but that won't trigger for changes made via JS
[02:01:10] <coldhead> you have to use custom events for that
[02:06:15] <Aque0s> coldhead: I'm not sure that I can use the link you pasted... that doesnt help me with the time delay... could i use an effect to fade the opacity and then use jquery's .delay?
[02:06:48] <gnarf> fuck.... i can't find my usb drive
[02:14:18] <coldhead> Aque0s: i guess i can write it for you
[02:14:32] <coldhead> don't worry about MY needs
[02:14:38] <coldhead> as long as YOU'RE okay
[02:15:56] <spirals> Hi. I'm literally from the javascript year 200, and jquery is indistinguishable from magic. Thanks! /waves
[02:16:01] <spirals> 2000*
[02:16:32] <coldhead> god bless you spirals
[02:18:10] <davidw> does jquery provide anything that would "linkify" a bit of text?
[02:18:11] <spirals> It's like Guy Kawasaki was sitting in my browser, making sure every interaction was pleasurable to the developer and the user both.
[02:18:56] <spirals> coldhead: thanks, yours too
[02:20:58] <gnarf> does anyone have a copy of IE 6 / 7 or 8 to take a screenshot of a fiddle for me?

[02:22:43] <gnarf> i'd do it myself, but the hard drive with my VM's is currently MIA
[02:22:46] <davidw> basically just throw out all the "extra junk" - punctuation, utf-8, etc...
[02:24:20] <gnarf> davidw: no, but you could regexp it probably
[02:24:41] <davidw> gnarf, I'm sure I could; I just was wondering if there is some code already done
[02:24:49] <gnarf> no
[02:24:52] <gnarf> maybe a plugin

[02:25:37] <ravenzz> '0' is null or it isn't an object

[02:26:02] <gnarf> ravenzz: can you flip that fiddle to jQuery(edget) instead of mootools? :)
[02:26:11] <ravenzz> oh lol
[02:26:12] <ravenzz> sure
[02:27:08] <ravenzz> ok, no errors
[02:27:28] <gnarf> and the divs? do they look the same?
[02:27:54] <ravenzz> yes
[02:28:05] <ravenzz> both on IE8 and IE8 in compatibility mode
[02:28:21] <alexidoia> when you use a single html page with different 'UIView' as div animated through jqtouch, how do you launch custom jquery/javascript function for each UIView ?
[02:29:01] <alexidoia> I guess the question is how do you bind a function to an jqtouch event such as 'slideup', etc...
[02:29:10] <gnarf> damnit
[02:29:14] <gnarf> i really need my IE VMs
[02:30:12] <ravenzz> http://ipinfo.info/netrenderer/index.php

[02:32:21] <ravenzz> eh i see
[02:32:39] <gnarf> i keep trying to run it but its giving me internal errors
[02:33:00] <ravenzz> yep me too
[02:33:12] <tallisman> euhm, I am currently using getScript to execute a script, if i alert something in iet it works, but i cannot read any variables declared in it

[02:33:53] <ravenzz> i am looking at google
[02:34:29] <gnarf> ravenzz: i have VM's on a hard drive that I can't find right now (i hope its on my desk at work)
[02:35:43] <alexidoia> how to you bind custom functino to specific animated event
[02:35:45] <alexidoia> say the user touch a button that take him with a slide effect to another view, how to trigger a custom action when this view is ready ?
[02:36:13] <ravenzz> gnarf http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3113573/gnarf2.png
[02:36:34] <gnarf> i thought you said they looked the same? :)
[02:37:32] <ravenzz> eh
[02:37:59] <gnarf> the one is half opacity, the other isn't
[02:38:19] <gnarf> im trying to figure out if that has "cleartype" or not
[02:38:19] <ravenzz> yep the 1st one is half opacity
[02:38:32] <gnarf> one more test then i swear i'm done using you as a screenshot service ;)
[02:39:03] <ravenzz> np ;)

[02:40:51] <ravenzz> oh isn't it
[02:41:17] <ravenzz> you need both 2 and 3?
[02:41:56] <gnarf> sure
[02:43:43] <tallisman> how can you prevent js from caching? because sometimes.. it really bugs bugtesting.
[02:44:00] <ravenzz> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3113573/gnarf3.png
[02:44:29] <SoulRaven> hi
[02:44:44] <SoulRaven> recomand me a i18n plugin that suports *.mo and *.po files
[02:44:51] <SoulRaven> please
[02:44:57] <gnarf> bah
[02:45:08] <gnarf> it appears filter=" " is enough to enact cleartype
[02:45:27] <gnarf> er disable
[02:45:36] <gnarf> fuckin retarted browser
[02:45:39] <gnarf> grr
[02:47:54] <nullius> tallisman: you can return js code dynamically with 'no-cache' header, i think
[02:48:34] <nullius> tallisman: or add random numer to js src attribute like script.js?r=123534
[02:51:20] <tallisman> yea :P, I just cleared my browsing cache :), getScript runs in the background..while it fetches the script it continues the rest :P, this is different than <script src=""></script>
[02:51:47] <tallisman> how can you pause script executing while executing the content of the script fetched?
[02:52:00] <gnarf> tallisman: you don't - you rely on a callback
[02:52:12] <gnarf> tallisman: and its not different than a <script> tag
[02:52:46] <gnarf> its already in a <script> tag so that one finishes executing before the other does
[02:52:47] <gnarf> :)
[02:53:32] <tallisman> oh.. so to make it work you have to open another script tag with the reference to the other script first..
[02:53:53] <gnarf> ?getScript
[02:53:54] <bot-t> jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[02:54:01] <gnarf> note that there is a callback
[02:54:40] <gnarf> after the script executes "success" will be called
[02:54:53] <gnarf> so make whatever you want to happen after the script loads in the callback
[02:56:04] <tallisman> that'd be alot of lines in the callback, not to mention, getscript { callback { getscript { callback { getscript { callback....etc
[02:56:50] <tallisman> I use getscript because including 30+ files in the header seems a little dirty.
[02:57:02] <gnarf> tallisman: including 30+ files is dirtier
[02:57:22] <gnarf> thats a TON of requests
[02:57:24] <coldhead> YOUR FACE IS
[02:57:36] <gnarf> ?hi5 @coldhead
[02:57:36] <bot-t> coldhead, ⁵
[02:57:41] <tallisman> @coldhead, lol
[02:57:51] <gnarf> tallisman: i suggest you abandon all hopes
[02:58:00] <gnarf> tallisman: and actually serve ONE JS FILE
[02:58:01] <gnarf> :)
[02:58:37] <gnarf> tallisman: also... just FYI
[02:58:41] <gnarf> like general design
[02:59:07] <gnarf> just because you can pass a function expression doesn't mean it needs to be a function expression
[02:59:13] <gnarf> it just needs to be a function
[02:59:54] <tallisman> hmm
[03:01:07] <gnarf> function doSomeShit() { doessomeshit()... } -- $.getScript(..., doSomeShit) works equaly well
[03:01:19] <gnarf> and considering standard function declarations are hoisted...
[03:01:34] <gnarf> $.getScript( url, doSomeShit); function doSomeShit() { } also works
[03:01:50] <tallisman> ye
[03:02:01] <tallisman> but I think you may be right about that single file
[03:03:27] <gnarf> i know i am
[03:04:10] <tallisman> want to explain why u know you are :]?
[03:04:47] <^zoggy^> intresting
[03:05:01] <^zoggy^> just built out a new jquery ui... 1.8.13 includes the ui menu css now?
[03:05:30] <gnarf> because there is this thing called best practices - and they say serve only ONE js file
[03:06:00] <tallisman> well, best practices are not 'always' best practices, so you don't know for sure ;p
[03:06:34] <gnarf> tallisman: serving one JS file is better than serving 30 either via 30 <script> tags or 30 $.getScript calls
[03:06:36] <gnarf> ANY day
[03:07:42] <tallisman> and what if that one js file is 1 milion lines of code, while you might only need 5000? and the difference is the possibility of chosing between files?
[03:07:53] <gnarf> tallisman: then use something like yepnope
[03:08:08] <tallisman> yepnope?
[03:08:15] <gnarf> ?yepnope
[03:08:16] <bot-t> yepnope is an asynchronous conditional resource loader that's super-fast, and allows you to load only the scripts that your users need: http://yepnopejs.com/
[03:08:42] <gnarf> i would only use that for "large" chunks of JS that aren't needed
[03:09:07] <gnarf> "smaller" chunks (especially unexecuted ones) aren't as big of a deal to send
[03:09:57] <gnarf> and it depends on if you are trying to lower your footprint
[03:10:04] <gnarf> or which footprint you're trying to lower
[03:10:14] <gnarf> but 30 files is 30 requests
[03:10:23] <gnarf> and trust me, its slow
[03:12:58] <tallisman> yea, I understand now :p
[03:23:04] <albacker> Hi i'm using the youtube api and jquery. this 7lines code should in my opinion work ok, but in fact it's not : http://pastebin.com/Z4dXU4jF . the console.log displays theright value but the player.seekTo doesn't work as intended. It should seek the video the the x second where x is the argument. every time the slider is moved the video is paused (like its going to start playing at another position) but in fact it just continues at the same position. Don'
[03:23:04] <albacker> t know what's causing this, might it be the slider?
[03:26:17] <gnarf> albacker: doubtful
[03:26:36] <albacker> i doubt that it's the youtube api.
[03:26:41] <gnarf> albacker: if the ui.value math is correct, its correct...
[03:26:56] <albacker> gnarf, the console.log displays the right value
[03:27:03] <gnarf> albacker: what happens if you replace all that math with the "right" value
[03:28:02] <albacker> gnarf, what do you mean? i put all that into a variable or i just put a static value, like 42 or sth like this
[03:28:22] <gnarf> albacker: yeah, just comment it out and put in the "right" value you think it should be
[03:28:31] <gnarf> test with a constant
[03:31:57] <tallisman> gnarf, can I talk to u for a second :)?
[03:32:36] <gnarf> there is a whole channel here
[03:33:41] <tallisman> yea, but typing alot in here seems like a little to much, might be the reason some people's questions get overlooked, wouldn't want that :P
[03:34:06] <albacker> gnarf, it doesn't work in fact.
[03:34:20] <gnarf> albacker: and if you call the seekTo from console?
[03:34:27] <gnarf> or like outside of an event handler?
[03:34:33] <gnarf> does that work?
[03:34:51] <gnarf> because it sounds to me like the seekTo is wrong/not working/perhaps not possible while player is "playing"
[03:34:52] <gnarf> *shrug*
[03:35:20] <tallisman> nevermind :p
[03:35:26] <albacker> where is the console? i'm not familiar with firebug
[03:35:37] <^wat^> or console using your in the albacker, localhost
[03:36:11] <albacker> eh
[03:36:25] <gnarf> albacker: see ?ftj
[03:36:26] <bot-t> albacker, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[03:36:26] <albacker> doing javascript:leftPlayer.seekTo(600); doesn't work (in the url bar)
[03:38:24] <albacker> gnarf, i think you debuged it.
[03:38:30] <albacker> the seekTo doesn't work while the vid is playing
[03:38:58] <albacker> thanks
[03:42:39] <albacker> nope it's not working..
[03:42:41] <albacker> something weird is here
[03:42:48] <^wat^> current layout there was weird
[03:43:07] <albacker> i think i can't seekTo the second if it's not in the loaded section or sth.
[03:44:42] <albacker> If the player has not yet buffered the portion of the video to which the user is seeking, then the player will start playing the video at the closest keyframe before the specified time.
[03:45:37] <asciant> Whats the a tag (anchor) equivalent of $('<li />')? is it $('<a />'), or just $('<a>')?
[03:46:57] <asciant> I am looking to create a new element, then append it with .append()
[03:52:11] <tallisman> Is there something in javascript that can imitate the c# function 'using'?
[03:52:28] <tallisman> in case of multidimensional arrays, for instance
[03:52:31] <gnarf> ?g c# using
[03:52:32] <bot-t> gnarf, C: Summary for Citigroup, Inc. New Common Stoc- Yahoo! Finance - http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=C#using
[03:52:40] <gnarf> tallisman: give me an example of wtf it does
[03:53:14] <tallisman> well, you have a namespace (IE System.Drawing) which contains a set of functions
[03:53:27] <tallisman> you can then do, using System;
[03:53:45] <gnarf> and that does what exactly?
[03:54:24] <tallisman> les work to type, System.Drawing.Rectangle for instance becomes Drawing.Rectangle
[03:54:39] <tallisman> It changes the context :P
[03:56:35] <gnarf> tallisman: "with" but its considered a bad thing, and is not allowed n ECMA5 strict https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/with
[03:57:44] <tallisman> that's pretty much what using does yes..
[03:59:08] <tallisman> I can always do the following 'var Drawing = System.Drawing;' in order to simulate the effect..
[03:59:42] <gnarf> right
[03:59:54] <gnarf> its actually better to do that anyway
[03:59:59] <tallisman> ye
[04:17:02] <Aque0s> coldhead: sorry my connection timed out, i just wanted to say thank you very much for writing that for me :) really, thanks man :)
[04:17:35] <coldhead> dawww you're welcome
[04:18:41] <tallisman> gnarf: How would you have done the following piece of code? http://codepaste.net/rvi179 , It works just fine, but seems so inefficient ( in the example I use typeof() which is unnecessary, please ignore :P
[04:19:32] <gnarf> a) i would not use arguments[0] and arguments[1]
[04:20:04] <tallisman> what would you use instead :P? (I do need the constructors to be variable), I thought this was the only way
[04:20:32] <gnarf> function( arg1, arg2 )
[04:20:40] <gnarf> or some better name
[04:21:13] <tallisman> does that work if there are insufficient parameters send along? :P
[04:21:47] <tallisman> as you can see it can either be send 2, 3 or 4 parameters
[04:21:48] <gnarf> ?js function boo( a, b, c ) { console.log( a, b, c ); }   boo( 1 )
[04:21:49] <bot-t> gnarf: 1 undefined undefined
[04:22:01] <tallisman> oh
[04:22:05] <tallisman> facepalm*
[04:23:09] <tallisman> any other suggestions :P? ( I think there might be some better method of determining whether the parameter is an object and an object of type Size, for instance)
[04:23:33] <gnarf> why do you care?
[04:23:46] <gnarf> you just wanna know if you can use x or width right?
[04:24:07] <Haprog> http://ontwik.com/javascript/fundamentals-for-great-jquery-development/ awesome video tutorial
[04:25:10] <tallisman> yea, but I can see a problem when I send along native objects along, which are objects, but do not have the getType function
[04:25:25] <gnarf> tallisman: thats cuz you're calling it before you check its existance
[04:25:54] <tallisman> how do you check for it's existance?
[04:25:54] <gnarf> tallisman: I hope this is just some random exercise
[04:26:28] <tallisman> yea, It kinda is :p, but what would you have done :P?
[04:27:19] <tallisman> currently I also want to add the drawRectangle(rectangle) function, giving the ability to add it on a canvas.. that'd be fun
[04:27:51] <tallisman> moment, afk
[04:29:20] <gnarf> tallisman: i wouldn't of made such a horrible api for myself to code
[04:29:22] <gnarf> :)
[04:32:32] <greg_f> I have such html: <tr><th><label for="id_host">Host:</label></th><td><input id="id_host" type="text"  /></td></tr> and i know $('#id_host'), how to select tr tag?
[04:33:17] <gnarf> greg_f: see ?closest
[04:33:17] <bot-t> greg_f, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[04:34:01] <greg_f> gnarf: thanks
[04:41:48] <Tobsn> does anyone know of a thumbnail hover plugin like the google image search hovers the thumbnails?
[04:48:42] <tallisman> You wouldn't have made such a horrible api for myself to code O.o? as like.. the work required to do it, or just because it's a plain stupid idea?
[04:49:12] <gnarf> tallisman: i woulda just made it take a) array of top/left/width/height
[04:49:24] <gnarf> b) object with top/left/width/height
[04:49:31] <gnarf> c) top, left, width, height
[04:49:50] <tallisman> but it's kinda like c) right?
[04:50:00] <tallisman> top, left, width, height ;P
[04:50:10] <gnarf> right
[04:50:23] <tallisman> or, more like, x, y, width, height
[04:50:27] <gnarf> i wouldn't of had the { top/left }, {width height }
[04:51:43] <tallisman> well, those are optional :P, you can also do this (Rectangle(left, top, width, height), instead of defining Point(left, top) and Size(width, height) first
[04:53:27] <tallisman> but back to the original question.. how do you check for the existence of a function in an object without getting an error?
[04:54:11] <gnarf> ?js var obj = { a: function() { } }; console.log( obj.a, (10).a )
[04:54:12] <bot-t> gnarf: <function () {}> undefined
[04:54:29] <gnarf> obj.a && obj.a()
[04:54:34] <gnarf> if it will only ever be a function
[04:54:47] <tallisman> ah :)
[04:54:48] <tallisman> thanks
[04:54:50] <gnarf> it would probably be easier to just test 'top' in obj
[04:54:53] <gnarf> or 'width' in obh
[04:55:04] <tallisman> hmm
[04:55:06] <gnarf> or rather 'x' in obj or 'width' in ob
[04:56:12] <nauthiz> hi all, i have a problem with one of my selectors. I have some inputs, like <input type="text" class="bla" id="idOfInput1">. I want to bind blur on every input using the class 'bla'. Using $(".bla").blur(...); works much too good, when I alert something inside this blur and the firefox-page loses focus, the alert-box wont go away anymore...
[04:56:39] <nauthiz> but it works fine when I select all inputfields one by one using the ids...
[04:57:46] <khurram> i have problem in displaying my ajax gif ? The menu comes from an ajax call and on first clicking on it it shows the gif and after that it doesn't show and hide the gif is there any thing i am missing ?
[05:00:54] <nauthiz> erm wait, I'm f***ing stupid... solved... ;)
[05:01:11] <gnarf> tallisman: ever heard of the term ducktyping?
[05:01:35] <tallisman> not before now, no :P
[05:01:45] <gnarf> ?g duck typing
[05:01:46] <bot-t> gnarf, Duck typing - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing
[05:02:00] <gnarf> ?w duck typing
[05:02:01] <bot-t> gnarf, Duck typing - In computer programming with object-oriented programming languages, duck typing is a style of dynamic typing in which an object's current set of methods and properties determines the valid semantics, rather than its inheritance from a particular class or implementation of a specific interface. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing
[05:09:22] <charas> Will someone look at my first attempt at making a simple jquery plugin?
[05:09:36] <tallisman> sure

[05:10:35] <charas> I basically just want to show a div when user scrolls down to the end of the page
[05:11:12] <charas> I earlier made it in a script which was working fine but now I am turning it into a plugin and it's not working now
[05:11:26] <Ely2> .seen sean`
[05:11:26] <hsbot> sean` was seen 1 hour, 32 minutes and 28 seconds ago, in #jquery-ot, saying: When I see paul_irish my penis be dublin
[05:11:38] <b-> charas interesting plugin yet I thought it was already done
[05:11:47] <b-> very useful none the less
[05:11:59] <charas> Thanks. Do you know where has it been done before?
[05:12:39] <charas> it's basically like that thingy you see on nytimes.com
[05:13:30] <b-> what thing on nytimes.com?
[05:14:29] <b-> I dew not see that
[05:14:58] <charas> Ohh nevermind, it was the inpiration to make this plugin. Can you see what is wrong in it.

[05:22:03] <nauthiz> erm, is it possible to bind more than one click-event to an object? i have up to three functions to bind dynamically to a single object.
[05:25:33] <ThisGuy> I get an error when trying to use $.parseXML on this http://pastebin.com/gNi9iS0f only in IE
[05:29:32] <_bart> nauthiz: have you tried this? $("a.btn").bind("click", firstfunction); $("a.btn").bind("click", secondfunction);
[05:30:26] <_bart> Like described here: http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[05:33:55] <MoTiOnXml> ajpiano: good work on http://fixingthesejquery.com
[05:34:01] <MoTiOnXml> ajpiano: \o
[05:38:05] <gnarf> nauthiz: yes
[05:38:29] <gnarf> nauthiz: but if any of them return false, it will probably stop calling the rest of them (i think, i don't exactly remember)
[05:44:53] <davidhong> nauthiz: use event.preventDefault() if you need to stop predefined default behaviour of the client
[05:56:33] <nauthiz> thx all, problem solved, my problem was to compute the functions in the correct order... :)
[06:13:21] <macheleon> ugh, client wants stacked dialogs (/whatever the correct term is)
[06:13:39] <macheleon> anyone know how to make colorbox give stacked / nested instances?
[06:28:57] <cato> Hi, I am trying to process a change-event on a <select>. How do I get the selected value before the change?
[06:30:17] <djQuery> cato: get the value on focus? store it in .data('somevalue')?
[06:31:58] <alexidoia> anyone that can help me out for a sec on jqtouch
[06:32:11] <djQuery> macheleon: give a click event on the colorbox that finds all the other colorboxes that are open and give them a predefined z-index. then give the one that was clicked that same value +1
[06:33:05] <djQuery> macheleon: wont realy help for nested but..
[06:34:19] <djQuery> ?colorbox
[06:34:19] <bot-t> ColorBox (plugin) - A light-weight, customizable lightbox plugin for jQuery 1.3 & 1.4 http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/
[06:35:26] <macheleon> interesting
[06:36:18] <macheleon> thanks djQuery, I have been assuming that the second colorbox is not opening at all. I'll just try opening something with a larger width and see
[06:38:43] <djQuery> macheleon: havent ever used color box before but have had to do something similar with multiple dragable divs on a page.
[06:41:06] <macheleon> makes sense
[06:41:38] <macheleon> nested lightboxes are a general UX no-no it seems, but I have to do it this way for this project
[06:42:28] <macheleon> and that's really all I need, a nice looking  / configurable lightbox that will nest / stack / choose your term
[06:46:17] <Tobsn> anyone ever saw a google image search like hover box?
[06:46:24] <Tobsn> or any idea how to accomplish something similar
[06:52:45] <djQuery> macheleon: see ui.dialog
[06:53:00] <djQuery> macheleon: you can have multiple dialogs open at the same time
[06:53:45] <macheleon> you might be onto something
[06:54:05] <lambda_x> is it possible to replace <img ..> with <a href=".."><img ..></a>, without replaceWith ?
[06:54:09] <macheleon> as long as dialog can work with ajax content, which I'd be surprised if it didn't
[06:54:17] <djQuery> macheleon: but that would only be for 1 image at a time unless you programed your own next and previous buttons
[06:54:46] <djQuery> lambda_x: see ?wrap
[06:54:46] <bot-t> lambda_x, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[06:54:46] <macheleon> djQuery: it's forms in external pages, no image groups
[06:55:22] <macheleon> so pop up a form, process and close that dialog
[06:55:42] <lambda_x> exacly what I was looking for! thx djQuery, bot-t
[06:56:05] <m1chael> when using an autocomplete/JSON function that is pulling records from a DB, how do you have a textbox showing the data, but when you submit, you are actually submitting a database ID?
[06:58:06] <djQuery> m1chael: use a hidden element to store the id? $('#myinput').autocomple({source: "getdata.php\aspx", select: function(){ code here })})
[06:58:35] <djQuery> m1chael: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
[07:02:37] <djQuery> i wish autocomplete had options for what property was label and what property was value
[07:03:03] <gnarf> djQuery: ummm
[07:03:18] <Tomashe> hey guys, there is a way to know what xml file is swf using on a website?
[07:03:36] <gnarf> djQuery: you realize that like the incoming data usually gets mapped through some function you write right?
[07:03:54] <gnarf> Tomashe: huh?
[07:04:10] <gnarf> xml using swf on a website sounds like an orgy
[07:04:37] <djQuery> gnarf: if ( items.length && items[0][this.options.labelattr || label] && items[this.options.valueattr || value].value ) {
[07:04:51] <gnarf> djQuery: { label: myobj.myotherprop, value: myobj.theotherprop, myobj: myobj }
[07:05:27] <djQuery> gnarf: and then gets mapped again inside of the _normalize function
[07:06:27] <gnarf> djQuery: I assume you meant to quote label and value in that line
[07:06:40] <gnarf> djQuery: but really, how hard is it to $.map() your results?
[07:06:43] <djQuery> gnarf: yeah
[07:07:00] <fabiobik> hi
[07:07:23] <fabiobik> im recieving json data from php
[07:07:31] <fabiobik> with .ajax on jquery
[07:07:31] <levu> hi, how do i make a data URL from a textarea's text? Is there something in HTML5/File API?
[07:07:33] <gnarf> djQuery: the autocomplete really only needs label and value anyway - anything else is just sugar for ui.item
[07:07:39] <fabiobik> how to select an element in particualr?
[07:07:44] <fabiobik> *particular
[07:07:47] <djQuery> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/PeUEJ/4/
[07:07:49] <gnarf> fabiobik: meaning?
[07:08:05] <fabiobik> gnarf  understand what  i mean?
[07:08:24] <fabiobik>  success: function(json)
[07:08:25] <gnarf> fabiobik: no you haven't said anything that makes sense yet :)
[07:08:34] <fabiobik> gnarf  success: function(json)
[07:08:39] <gnarf> fabiobik: i really hope you aren't about to paste a function in irc
[07:08:41] <gnarf> ?p
[07:08:42] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[07:08:54] <gnarf> don't spam us with your function
[07:08:56] <gnarf> :)
[07:08:56] <fabiobik> gnarf i want to  select an element on json array
[07:09:03] <gnarf> okay
[07:09:07] <gnarf> its an array? or an object?
[07:09:15] <gnarf> console.log( data ) shows what?
[07:09:20] <gnarf> whats the json look like?
[07:09:29] <gnarf> and you don't "select" them as much as you "reference" them
[07:09:35] <fabiobik> gnarf on php ive encoded an array in php
[07:09:51] <gnarf> fabiobik: that doesn't mean shit to me... this is #jquery not ##php ;)
[07:09:51] <Tobsn> serialized it?
[07:09:54] <gnarf> let me see the json
[07:09:59] <gnarf> or let me see the console.log()
[07:10:07] <fabiobik> gnarf wait
[07:10:07] <gnarf> and tell me what you want to find inside of it
[07:10:36] <Tobsn> $array = array( 'test' => 'blah' ); if you json_encode that in javascript you would get it into lets say data and than you access it with data.test
[07:10:48] <gnarf> Tobsn: first of all, in JS - that is NOT an array
[07:10:53] <gnarf> you know that
[07:10:57] <gnarf> prolly
[07:10:58] <Tobsn> never said that
[07:11:02] <gnarf> but not sure that fabiobik does
[07:11:38] <fabiobik> Tobsn yes ive done that
[07:11:39] <MoTiOnXml> is there a shorter way of checking if result.length > 0
[07:11:46] <MoTiOnXml> like .any() in LINQ?
[07:11:51] <gnarf> MoTiOnXml: .length
[07:11:57] <MoTiOnXml> gnarf: nice ;)
[07:11:59] <gnarf> unless it can be negative
[07:12:11] <MoTiOnXml> gnarf: can't - it's a check for a find()
[07:12:20] <gnarf> MoTiOnXml: then yeah, 0 is false
[07:12:21] <gnarf> ;)
[07:12:37] <MoTiOnXml> there's no .any() which would have been nice
[07:12:48] <fabiobik> http://codepad.org/gdXSvpsR
[07:12:57] <Tobsn> anyone an idea how to display a lot of images float:left (linked) and than on hover display a box surounding it with more infos? im kinda lost with that
[07:12:58] <gnarf> MoTiOnXml: nice, but pointless function call
[07:13:09] <MoTiOnXml> slower, you mean
[07:13:15] <gnarf> Tobsn: see ?g jquery ui position
[07:13:16] <bot-t> Tobsn, jQuery UI - Position Demos & Documentation - http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/
[07:13:25] <Tobsn> yeah i dont want to use UI
[07:13:33] <fabiobik> gnarf http://codepad.org/gdXSvpsR
[07:13:52] <gnarf> Tobsn: then i don't want to help you try to position an element relative to a float REALLY easily
[07:14:18] <Tobsn> but i cant position it absolute
[07:14:31] <gnarf> and maybe looking at the docs page for it might make you realize that the UI position utility is standalone
[07:14:49] <gnarf> so you don't need to use UI, you can just use position
[07:15:05] <Tobsn> well
[07:15:09] <Tobsn> my problem is rather the concept
[07:15:15] <Tobsn> whats the best way to do that?
[07:15:23] <Tobsn> find position of element, place element over it?
[07:15:45] <gnarf> Tobsn: over / beside / expand? what is your goal
[07:15:54] <Tobsn> well over or expand around it
[07:16:00] <Tobsn> you know how the google image search looks like?
[07:16:04] <gnarf> no
[07:16:04] <djQuery> Tobsn: ?see ui.position
[07:16:12] <Tobsn> go to google and search for images
[07:16:15] <Tobsn> when you hover above images
[07:16:23] <Tobsn> you get this fancy zoom/info box around them
[07:16:29] <Tobsn> i cant figure out how they do that
[07:16:44] <djQuery> .seen bot-t
[07:16:45] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 3 minutes and 28 seconds ago, in #jquery, saying: Tobsn, jQuery UI - Position Demos & Documentation - http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/
[07:16:54] <djQuery> ?ui.postion
[07:16:54] <bot-t> djQuery, UI/API/1.8/Position - Utility script for absolutely positioning any widget relative to the window, document, a particular element, or the cursor/mouse. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Position
[07:17:17] <Tobsn> hmm could i create an element on the fly for that?
[07:17:54] <djQuery> Tobsn: or just wrap the existing element on the fly
[07:18:04] <Tobsn> hmm
[07:18:10] <Tobsn> but wouldnt that break the layout?
[07:18:15] <gnarf> Tobsn: a) they don't use floats
[07:18:19] <gnarf> they use inline-blocks
[07:18:29] <Tobsn> inline blocks ha
[07:18:51] <Tobsn> yeah its kinda nifty what they do, they sort the images in a way that its justified
[07:19:25] <gnarf> b) they don't hide the original image
[07:19:40] <gnarf> they inject a position absolute div over the top of the one you hovered
[07:20:22] <gnarf> these are things i found out using the inspector in chrome
[07:20:25] <gnarf> just now
[07:20:36] <gnarf> now
[07:20:41] <Tobsn> what the best way to inject a div with image etc.? is there a quick way to generate that and kill it again without appending it?
[07:21:13] <macheleon> chrome dev tools / firebug / etc. <3
[07:21:22] <djQuery> Tobsn: use chrome to look at it and set a break point on the modification of the dom and look and see what they do
[07:21:45] <Tobsn> just wondering if its possible in jquery
[07:21:52] <Tobsn> creating elements on the fly not attached to anything
[07:21:59] <djQuery> ?g chrome developer tools google q/o 2011  @tobsn
[07:21:59] <bot-t> tobsn, Chrome Dev Tools Reloaded - Google - http://www.google.com/events/io/2011/static/notesfiles/ChromeDevToolsReloaded.pdf
[07:22:11] <gnarf> I would probably clone the hovered image, wrap it, add my content, position it using ui.position and then animate it to grow out of the image
[07:22:29] <Tobsn> clone it somewhere into the parent div?
[07:22:29] <gnarf> or maybe i might just make one div
[07:22:35] <gnarf> and append the clone to it
[07:22:43] <gnarf> Tobsn: parent container, body, whatever
[07:22:48] <Tobsn> k
[07:22:51] <Tobsn> sounds good
[07:23:08] <Tobsn> thanks :)
[07:23:32] <djQuery> gnarf: did you look at the autocompelte snippit/
[07:23:43] <gnarf> djQuery: yeah what about it? :)
[07:23:57] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/PeUEJ/4/
[07:24:14] <djQuery> just checkin to see if you liked it you had comments about he last one
[07:25:05] <gnarf> djQuery: yeah, its pretty nice... one suggest --- see if you can't hook the "refresh"
[07:25:08] <gnarf> too
[07:25:27] <gnarf> that way if you disable / alter the item list you can .autocomplete("refresh") to reload the html
[07:25:32] <gnarf> consistant with other ui plugins
[07:25:59] <gnarf> djQuery: i like that approach a bit more than the other approaches :)
[07:25:59] <djQuery> gnarf: doesnt look like it has a refresh method
[07:26:05] <gnarf> djQuery: add one?
[07:26:23] <gnarf> does nothing unless its a "datalist" but yeah
[07:26:29] <gnarf> it'll be useful :)
[07:26:34] <djQuery> gnarf: thats not a problem but should it be a bug that it doesnt have one.?
[07:27:05] <gnarf> djQuery: not really, nothing ever really changes about the autocompletes original html that it needs to know about (until now)
[07:27:16] <djQuery> gnarf: I can see refresh for other things bysides just datalist.
[07:27:25] <gnarf> name one? :)
[07:27:34] <djQuery> gnarf: hmmmm nevermind
[07:27:56] <djQuery> if the src is a string you would just set the src option again.
[07:28:36] <LearnerJq> what is the best IFrame based jquery file upload plugin?
[07:28:44] <gnarf> djQuery: one other suggestion
[07:28:56] <gnarf> use $(document.getElementById( id ))
[07:29:08] <djQuery> LearnerJq: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[07:29:18] <gnarf> it handles things with funky chars without having to escape them
[07:29:59] <djQuery> gnarf: you mean instead of $('#' + this.element.attr('list'))
[07:30:13] <gnarf> djQuery: yeah, also, a readability thing
[07:30:25] <gnarf> cache some vars that are used in the more complicated statements there
[07:31:25] <djQuery> gnarf: need a better name than datalistselector 
[07:31:56] <gnarf> djQuery: itemselector: "option", list: true
[07:32:02] <djQuery> and that should probably be find instead of children incase they are using <optgroup>
[07:32:25] <kored> ello
[07:32:46] <kored> is there the possibility with jquery assuring that if one function is done, then the other function will run
[07:33:11] <innociv> What does the legality tend to be when you package free plugins with something that's charged for? Usually the licenses say that it just must retain the copyright
[07:33:13] <kored> and only if its done
[07:33:16] <djQuery> kored: its called a callback
[07:33:24] <kored> yea
[07:33:29] <kored> i think i have it implemented
[07:33:31] <kored> but
[07:33:33] <kored> it doesnt work
[07:33:42] <djQuery> innociv: that you dont do that
[07:33:49] <charas> Guys guys guys, can you tell what is possibly wrong with my first jquery plugin : http://pastebin.com/FAsn0wVh  It's not working in the plugin form, working nice when I had the code in the header of my html file
[07:33:50] <djQuery> kored dont msg me
[07:33:52] <kored> sent you a link by pm djQuery
[07:33:57] <kored> i dont want it public
[07:33:58] <kored> thats why
[07:34:09] <LearnerJq> djQuery: thanks...but i dont need to submit the whole form via ajax..just that upload image to behave like ajax?
[07:34:11] <kored> hover on the image
[07:34:26] <innociv> Oh?
[07:35:39] <djQuery> innociv: typicaly you realy on them to allready have the paid for item installed themselves and give instructions on how to point your plugin at the paid stuff
[07:36:33] <kored> djQuery cant you just check one sec the site, then you'll know what i mean
[07:36:47] <innociv> The hazey part is that I'm not even selling any of the code.  The PHP and javascript I've written will all be open source.  What'll cost people is to be able to connect to my cometd to add data streaming functionality.
[07:37:40] <innociv> Though I suppose I'd want a clause in trying to reverse engineer the cometd based on the data sent and expected return data to emulate their own.
[07:37:55] <gnarf> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/Jt9j8/1/
[07:38:13] <gnarf> djQuery: note that $("#test::") wont find id="test::" :)
[07:38:31] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: you forgot to enable jquery on that fiddle :p
[07:38:52] <djQuery> ryanneufeld: no it in there
[07:39:00] <innociv> Why the hell do you have colons in an id?
[07:39:18] <gnarf> oops
[07:39:29] <djQuery> innociv: becase when ur writing a plugin you have to account for all sorts of stupid crap
[07:39:31] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: too bad its included in the resources via git version
[07:39:34] <gnarf> it just also has mootools
[07:39:41] <gnarf> blame djQuery it was his base fiddle ;)
[07:39:42] <innociv> What do you mean?
[07:40:14] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: daww…. now i feel silly
[07:40:34] <feklee> Where do I find the source of the jQuery documentation?
[07:40:44] <gnarf> feklee: you don't (currently)

[07:44:35] <ryanneufeld> file it as a bug in trac
[07:45:17] <djQuery> gnarf: whats gonna happen to http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/Jt9j8/1/
[07:45:22] <gnarf> feklee: ask someone in #jquery? :)
[07:45:35] <gnarf> feklee: or #jquery-dev

[07:50:10] <gnarf> there
[07:50:32] <dabear> but what if I wanna use jquery 1.3?
[07:50:34] <kurisu> djQuery: thanks
[07:50:35] <dabear> :p
[07:51:17] <ryanneufeld> dabear: then you need a hug
[07:51:29] <dabear> bearhug
[07:51:34] <ryanneufeld> lul
[07:52:45] <gnarf> bah
[07:52:50] <gnarf> ill rewrite it again
[07:52:59] <gnarf> does someone have a better suggestion for the wording on that one?
[07:53:09] <gnarf> the beta reqs 1.4+
[07:53:16] <gnarf> but the old version is only 1.2
[07:54:30] <gnarf> then again
[07:54:36] <gnarf> noone cares about 1.2 anymore
[07:54:37] <gnarf> ;)
[07:54:46] <gnarf> has anyone played with the beta much btw?
[07:55:00] <gnarf> Noone has been giving any big feedback, so I assume its working :)
[07:55:16] <dabear> gnarf: I would rather assume noone uses it
[07:55:18] <dabear> hah
[07:55:35] <gnarf> color?
[07:55:44] <sodapop> can i use find to select e.g. a link by value <a ..>value</a>
[07:55:47] <dabear> the beta, yes
[07:55:59] <g0bl1n> can't get it. This json http://www.pastie.org/2083577 validates on jsonlint. Yet, since 1.5 $.ajax() fails when receiving it
[07:56:11] <dabear> ?contains @ sodapop
[07:56:11] <bot-t> sodapop, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[07:56:16] <g0bl1n> dataType: 'json'
[07:56:19] <sodapop> cheers
[07:56:20] <dabear> sodapop: note that it is slow
[07:56:22] <gnarf> dabear: i need people to use it :)
[07:56:23] <fabiobik> why when i put fbio on json array
[07:56:27] <fabiobik> dont appears?
[07:56:45] <dabear> huh
[07:57:02] <fabiobik> ?
[07:57:13] <ryanneufeld> fabiobik: can you restate your question, it' doesn't make any sense
[07:57:15] <kurisu> thatnks for the suggestions guys... the jquery.animate is the functiothat I'm trying to use... but its not working
[07:57:15] <dabear> what you mean
[07:57:29] <fabiobik> i have this
[07:57:30] <fabiobik> {"nome":null,"identidade":"13811336"}
[07:57:33] <gnarf> kurisu: you need the color plugin to animate colors
[07:57:39] <dabear> kurisu: my car isn't working. how to fix?
[07:57:46] <fabiobik> but were is null need to be fbio
[07:57:59] <gnarf> kurisu: I wrote the new beta, and would love if you tried using it ;)
[07:58:19] <Whirl3d> Good Morning All. Quick easy question about $.one() with respect to image loading, here is the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/kRu2r/1/
[07:58:21] <ryanneufeld> fabiobik: where is that coming from?
[07:58:38] <fabiobik> ryanneufeld from php
[07:58:50] <g0bl1n> I need a fail callback, so must use $.ajax() instead of getJson()
[07:58:55] <kurisu> which plugin?
[07:58:55] <ryanneufeld> how are you generating the JSON in php?
[07:59:06] <kurisu> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/blob/master/jquery.color.js ????
[07:59:23] <ryanneufeld> g0bl1n:   think you can get a defered from $.getJSON too
[07:59:25] <fabiobik> ryanneufeld json_encode
[07:59:25] <kurisu> gnarf: ^^^^^
[08:00:02] <gnarf> kurisu: thats the source
[08:00:02] <ryanneufeld> fabiobik: I think that your problem is with that array then
[08:00:02] <g0bl1n> ryanneufeld, all my code is using $.ajax(), and all the JSON validates ok in jsonlint. Yet, in 1.6.1 fails
[08:00:04] <gnarf> but yeah
[08:00:26] <gnarf> http://code.jquery.com/color/jquery.color-2.0b1.js
[08:00:30] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ g0blin
[08:00:31] <bot-t> g0blin, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[08:00:33] <gnarf> http://code.jquery.com/color/jquery.color-2.0b1.min.js
[08:00:34] <kurisu> ok... ive got that, but can't find any usage instructions
[08:00:45] <fabiobik> ryanneufeld $teste = array('nome' => 'fabio');
[08:01:04] <fabiobik> its how its done
[08:01:15] <fabiobik> *fbio
[08:01:46] <ryanneufeld> OH
[08:01:51] <ryanneufeld> you have an encoding issue
[08:01:59] <g0bl1n> really ?
[08:01:59] <ryanneufeld> i'm seeing f?bio when you type that
[08:02:08] <fabiobik> omg
[08:02:08] <fabiobik> lol
[08:02:10] <ryanneufeld> not you g0bl1n
[08:02:11] <g0bl1n> oh, was for favbio
[08:02:14] <g0bl1n> :-)
[08:02:14] <Whirl3d> what happens if you use $(selector).one(someFunc) and then later you call someFunc($(selector))? Will it fire someFunc twice, or just once?
[08:02:34] <fabiobik> im using uft-8
[08:02:35] <ryanneufeld> g0bl1n: can I see some code you're using, or the end point that's dumping the JSON?
[08:02:42] <kurisu> gnarf: is there any usage instructions anywhere?
[08:02:54] <ryanneufeld> fabiobik: does your JSON pass jsonlint?
[08:03:09] <g0bl1n> ryanneufeld, I was pasting the js code. The code is generated by ruby Merb framework
[08:03:17] <gnarf> kurisu: .animate({ backgroundColor: "#abcdef" })
[08:03:20] <g0bl1n> ryanneufeld, we have an Object.to_json
[08:03:22] <fabiobik> ryanneufeld how to see that?
[08:03:23] <ryanneufeld> kurisu: you just us .animate() and pass the background color
[08:03:25] <gnarf> kurisu: the animation part really doesn't need one :)
[08:03:54] <kurisu> thats what I thought but cant seem to get it to work
[08:04:00] <ryanneufeld> fabiobik: http://jsonlint.com/ paste the output of your json_encode
[08:04:01] <gnarf> kurisu: v2b1 lets you do some other neat stuff like .animate({ backgroundcolor: $.Color({ saturation: 0 }) });
[08:04:02] <ryanneufeld> see if it passes
[08:04:31] <ryanneufeld> g0bl1n: (your user name is really hard to type) is that JS?
[08:05:24] <g0bl1n> ryanneufeld, http://fixee.org/paste/6tim0wi/
[08:05:45] <g0bl1n> ryanneufeld, sobre about the user name :-)
[08:05:51] <g0bl1n> *sorry
[08:05:55] <kurisu> gnarf: ok thanks I'll try using that version
[08:06:16] <dabear> Whirl3d: if you wanna call earlier bound functions, use $(sel).trigger(...)
[08:06:23] <ryanneufeld> g0bl1n: you don't need var parsed = jQuery.parseJSON(data); when you have dataType: 'json'
[08:06:32] <ryanneufeld> data will be an object
[08:06:43] <g0bl1n> ryanneufeld, oh, ok
[08:06:45] <ryanneufeld> just console.log(data) and you'll see what I mean
[08:06:50] <g0bl1n> ok
[08:06:51] <gnarf> g0bl1n: and if it isn't valid JSON, its an .error() case
[08:07:01] <ryanneufeld> what gnarf said :)
[08:07:07] <g0bl1n> gnarf, but the JSON validates ok in jsonlint
[08:07:22] <Whirl3d> dabear, thanks for the reply. I wanna make sure that my "configureImage" function (used as a callback in the load bind) is only called once.
[08:07:26] <g0bl1n> gnarf, its this: http://www.pastie.org/2083577
[08:07:28] <ryanneufeld> also $('.result').html(data); that's not gonna do what you think it's gonna do
[08:07:39] <g0bl1n> ryanneufeld, yes, its to delete, just a test
[08:07:46] <gnarf> g0bl1n: i was just giving you some extraneous info to assimilate into your knowledge of ajax
[08:07:59] <g0bl1n> gnarf, :-) thanks
[08:08:06] <Whirl3d> I have to check if (img.complete) to compensate for IE's failure to trigger load for cached images
[08:08:16] <ryanneufeld> gnarfs knows his stuff, I
[08:08:29] <ryanneufeld> I'd take anything he offers and put it to use :)
[08:08:37] <g0bl1n> gnarf, it was working fine with jquery 1.4.3
[08:08:51] <g0bl1n> upgraded to 1.6.1 and I get .error()
[08:09:26] <g0bl1n> gnarf, can it be related to headers of the response ?
[08:09:38] <gnarf> g0bl1n: MAYBE... but unlikely
[08:09:38] <ryanneufeld> what does console.log(data) do?
[08:09:53] <Whirl3d> <-smacks forehead
[08:09:54] <gnarf> g0bl1n: can you link me to the live version and the line in code on that version?
[08:10:17] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: why?
[08:10:39] <g0bl1n> gnarf, live version ?
[08:10:54] <gnarf> g0bl1n: the version that is breaking
[08:11:29] <gnarf> g0bl1n: random question
[08:11:32] <gnarf> is line 12 a typo?
[08:11:36] <gnarf> should be dataType:
[08:11:42] <gnarf> also
[08:11:47] <gnarf> async: false is like horrible idea
[08:12:16] <g0bl1n> gnarf, in Chrome I get a: "Resource Interpreted as Document but transfered with MIME type text/javascript"
[08:12:27] <kurisu> gnaft: still can't ge tit tp work, would you mind having a quick look at my script please, (it's quite small)??  http://pastebin.com/EuuUF3ZA
[08:12:40] <kurisu> *get it to
[08:12:57] <g0bl1n> gnarf, yes, I tested removing the dataType line
[08:13:06] <g0bl1n> typo
[08:13:08] <g0bl1n> corrected
[08:13:41] <Whirl3d> poor gnarf, it's  a real bitch being popular and in demand, huh? You are so generous, I dunno how you do it.
[08:13:44] <g0bl1n> gnarf, yes, for async, I want to test this that way. When working, set it to trye
[08:13:45] <g0bl1n> true
[08:13:47] <gnarf> g0bl1n: is http://fixee.org/paste/6tim0wi/ your current code?
[08:13:58] <ryanneufeld> g0bl1n: test with true
[08:14:05] <g0bl1n> yes
[08:14:09] <g0bl1n> ok
[08:14:23] <gnarf> kurisu: try looking at the errors in your console
[08:14:26] <ryanneufeld> your url is url:      "/items/"+item+".js",
[08:14:29] <gnarf> kurisu: that is not valid javascript
[08:14:50] <g0bl1n> ryanneufeld, yes, for localhost
[08:14:50] <gnarf> ?js $().animate({ backgroundColor: #ddd });
[08:14:51] <bot-t> gnarf: SyntaxError: illegal character
[08:14:53] <kurisu> gnarf: oh it's an example i pulled from the web
[08:14:56] <gnarf> ?js $().animate({ backgroundColor: "#ddd" });
[08:14:56] <bot-t> gnarf: []
[08:15:03] <gnarf> note the quotes
[08:15:12] <gnarf> kurisu: jshint.com
[08:15:34] <kurisu> gnarf: thanks I'll look into now
[08:15:53] <ryanneufeld> g0bl1n: the .js on the end, could be confusing it, it shouldn't though
[08:16:02] <g0bl1n> tested .json
[08:16:04] <g0bl1n> same results
[08:16:26] <ryanneufeld> k
[08:16:30] <g0bl1n> :)
[08:16:38] <ryanneufeld> are you generating your json with PHP?
[08:16:42] <g0bl1n> ruby
[08:16:52] <ryanneufeld> can you set headers in ruby (I know nothing about it)
[08:16:55] <ryanneufeld> ?
[08:17:16] <g0bl1n> I can try
[08:17:19] <g0bl1n> yes I can
[08:17:26] <g0bl1n> what should the headers say ?
[08:17:45] <ryanneufeld> Content-type: application/json
[08:17:52] <g0bl1n> ryanneufeld, ok
[08:17:54] <g0bl1n> good idea
[08:18:03] <ryanneufeld> that will help, but it *may* not be the cause of your problem
[08:18:38] <gnarf> (likely isnt)
[08:18:47] <gnarf> g0bl1n: you're asking for json but using it as html?
[08:19:44] <GhostBear> Hello. I have some amount of <a> elements with same class and i want to bind these links to toggle next div after them. Right now i have $('.a').click(function(){ but what sort of selector should i use to select next div element after current one? Or maybe i should organize the whole thing differently?
[08:20:11] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: he's just trying to debug, badly
[08:20:21] <GhostBear> $('self + dev').toggle() ?
[08:20:41] <ryanneufeld> g0bl1n: use console.log(data) to see what's coming back
[08:21:31] <Whirl3d> $('a').click(function () {$(this).next("div").toggle();}); ?
[08:21:45] <LearnerJq> learnerjq
[08:21:49] <GhostBear> Oh, thank you, i got the idea
[08:22:16] <GhostBear> also was typo: "+ div"*
[08:22:47] <gnarf> ?next @GhostBear
[08:22:48] <bot-t> GhostBear, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[08:22:52] <gnarf> $(this).next()
[08:23:00] <gnarf>  = the element after the <a>
[08:23:23] <ryanneufeld> $('a').click(function () {$(this).next("div").add(this).toggle();});
[08:23:42] <Whirl3d> $(this).next("div") will give you the next div after the a, not just the next element
[08:23:55] <GhostBear> Yes, already working, thank you
[08:25:01] <gnarf> Whirl3d: not entirely stated correct
[08:25:11] <Whirl3d> Cool, how so?
[08:25:12] <gnarf> it will give you the next element after the a - if it is a div
[08:25:22] <Whirl3d> aha, good to know
[08:25:40] <gnarf> .next( selector ) === .next().filter( selector )
[08:26:00] <gnarf> "next div after the a"
[08:26:00] <Whirl3d> so then how do you get the next div?
[08:26:15] <gnarf> .nextAll("div").first()
[08:26:47] <Whirl3d> cool. thanks for the clarification.
[08:26:51] <kurisu> gnarf: ok so I've fixed that code problem "$(this).animate({ backgroundColor: "#DDD" }, "slow");" but still cant get it to work
[08:27:09] <gnarf> ?doesn't work
[08:27:09] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.

[08:27:25] <bot-t> kurisu, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[08:27:28] <kurisu> gnarf: am I right in thinking that I dont need to add anything into myu html except calling the scripts?
[08:27:36] <gnarf> kurisu: you need to include the scripts
[08:27:40] <kurisu> basically it does nothing
[08:28:24] <gnarf> are there any errors in the javascript console?
[08:28:26] <kurisu> i've included the scripts (your script and mmy one that you looked at bu it does nothing

[08:30:22] <kurisu> gnarf: sorry, how would I do that?
[08:30:32] <kurisu> gnarf: can I do it in firebug?

[08:31:38] <BlaDe^> any ideas why ? Works perfectly everywhere else

[08:32:37] <ryanneufeld> *ie gargles
[08:33:58] <fabiobik> how to test an input box text   when user stop writing?
[08:34:12] <ryanneufeld> can't
[08:34:21] <ryanneufeld> you have to bind to the keyup event
[08:34:23] <fabiobik> onkeyup will test everytime user key up
[08:34:44] <ryanneufeld> right which is when they've stopped typing… that character
[08:34:58] <fabiobik> yah
[08:35:09] <ryanneufeld> clairvoyance is unfortunately not a programmable freature :p
[08:35:14] <fabiobik> ryanneufeld but that generates a lot of traffic
[08:35:23] <ryanneufeld> most autocompletes have a timer that checks
[08:35:32] <fabiobik> ya
[08:35:33] <ryanneufeld> and they also cache the results locally

[08:41:11] <ryanneufeld> yes, you can rebind .change()
[08:41:22] <kored> ty ryanneufeld
[08:41:26] <BlaDe^> ryanneufeld how?
[08:41:40] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ BlaDe^
[08:41:40] <bot-t> BlaDe^, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[08:42:16] <BlaDe^> ryanneufeld: http://pastie.org/private/cevpb9p4cgenijzvwi9brw
[08:42:30] <BlaDe^> It works fine on all browsers except IE 7/8 with .live('change', function() { });
[08:42:47] <BlaDe^> .change() works fine, once, in IE (and everything else) -- it needs to be bound again after that
[08:43:24] <ryanneufeld> okay, I can see why you want live
[08:43:27] <kurisu> gnarf: in the debuggin slideshow it states "Was jQuery.noConflict() run? (Wordpress does this by default)" I am using wordpress... should it be run or not?
[08:43:44] <kurisu> it is not very lear
[08:43:49] <BlaDe^> ryanneufeld it's frustrating as it's only an issue with IE...
[08:43:50] <kurisu> clear*
[08:43:58] <BlaDe^> which is around 14% of our traffic
[08:44:17] <ryanneufeld> BlaDe^: what version of jquery are you using?
[08:44:27] <ryanneufeld> have you tried it with the latest beta?
[08:44:33] <BlaDe^> 1.6.1
[08:44:37] <ryanneufeld> hm
[08:44:38] <ryanneufeld> k
[08:44:48] <ryanneufeld> I don't have IE, so I can't test it
[08:45:07] <ryanneufeld> but have you tried adding (for shits and giggles) a .show()?
[08:45:35] <BlaDe^> heh, no.. i've tried using .trigger() for clicking the document... because when I click, the insertAfter() appears
[08:45:42] <gnarf> kurisu: that means that $ doesn't work
[08:45:46] <gnarf> you have to use jQuery
[08:46:08] <gnarf> ?jQuery.noConflict
[08:46:08] <bot-t> jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[08:46:10] <ryanneufeld> BlaDe^: you're using two classes
[08:46:28] <BlaDe^> ryanneufeld, .show() doesn't make a difference
[08:46:28] <ryanneufeld> BlaDe^:  new_file and add_more
[08:46:33] <BlaDe^> ryanneufeld yes I know
[08:46:35] <kurisu> gnarf: thanks... again
[08:46:47] <kurisu> gnarf: don't mean to pester you
[08:46:50] <ryanneufeld> BlaDe^: can you build this into a jsfiddle
[08:46:52] <BlaDe^> ryanneufeld it's important to do that because otherwise the first file will get overwritten
[08:47:12] <BlaDe^> ryanneufeld it'd take a while, it's quicker for me to show you a live copy -- since you don't have IE you can't reproduce the bug anyway
[08:47:16] <BlaDe^> is that ok?
[08:47:18] <ryanneufeld> yes
[08:47:21] <ryanneufeld> I can look
[08:47:27] <ryanneufeld> there might be a better way any how
[08:47:54] <BlaDe^> noticed you the url :-)
[08:52:16] <fabiobik> how to .load() every x seconds?
[08:52:41] <fabiobik> im doing this
[08:52:42] <gnarf> BlaDe^: can you reproduce the issue in a fiddle?
[08:52:42] <fabiobik> setTimeout(  $('#main').load('index.php'), 10000);
[08:52:47] <fabiobik> but this dont work
[08:52:52] <timing> fabiobik: setInterval
[08:52:57] <timing> setTimeout is only once
[08:53:12] <BlaDe^> gnarf I will try in a minute, I found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2678771/jquery-select-change-click-problem-change-doesnt-work-in-ie-click-doesnt-wor
[08:53:29] <gnarf> ?setInterval @fabiobik
[08:53:29] <bot-t> fabiobik, http://www.erichynds.com/javascript/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern/
[08:53:37] <gnarf> timing: ^^^
[09:07:42] <thorwil> hi! i have a case here where $('span') returns [span#5341.jpg, span], but $('span#5341.jpg') returns [ ]. putting a \ in fron of the . doesn't help. any ideas?
[09:10:26] <thorwil> d'oh, has to be  $('span#5341\\.jpg'). but how do i get there pro grammatically, having names like "5341.jpg" in vars?
[09:15:58] <rethus> http://pastebin.com/j7Tbf4mm : thats the output of console.log("info",response").
[09:16:08] <rethus> means the var response has two arrays inside.
[09:16:34] <rethus> how can i create an Object where the first array is the key and the second array is the value?
[09:19:48] <niels__> I have several hidden divs in the same position, I want the specific table to fade in when clicked, and that works, but I want the next div to show up in the same position when click, and thereby replacing the other div. My script as of now looks like this: http://pastebin.com/cAqete8W What's the next approach? Thank you!
[09:20:47] <ryanneufeld> rethus: keys have to be simple, can't be complex objects/arrays
[09:20:52] <ryanneufeld> have to be a string or a number
[09:21:17] <rethus> i try to make an example on jsfiddle
[09:34:40] <rethus> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/yGwN4/3/
[09:34:45] <rethus> here it is
[09:34:59] <rethus> cause in two arrays...
[09:35:10] <rethus> should become one object
[09:37:04] <ryanneufeld> you have a string key, with a string value
[09:37:07] <BinaryKitten> rethus looking at it it's confusing
[09:37:32] <BinaryKitten> I think i missed the intro to the issue (that ryanneufeld is probably helping you with)
[09:39:06] <rethus> need to have myobject.user = 1 ... myobject.audio = Unmuted an so on
[09:39:28] <ryanneufeld> ahhh
[09:39:30] <ryanneufeld> I see
[09:39:40] <rethus> first array has the keys, second the values
[09:39:41] <ryanneufeld> so you're trying to have tab separated values?
[09:39:44] <niels__> I have several hidden divs in the same position, I want the specific table to fade in when clicked, and that works, but I want the next div to show up in the same position when click, and thereby replacing the other div. My script as of now looks like this: http://pastebin.com/cAqete8W What's the next approach? Thank you!
[09:39:54] <ryanneufeld> okay, I see what you're after here now
[09:41:58] <BinaryKitten> niels__ can you create a jsbin or a jsfiddle with more html please?
[09:42:16] <tman> if i you mousemove on a nested element that is sitting ontop (with a higher z-index) of another element will that event bubble to the parent?
[09:42:34] <BinaryKitten> tman depends on your event code
[09:42:44] <ryanneufeld> rethus: I think you would better off using multiple inputs instead of a text area
[09:42:48] <niels__> BinaryKitten: yes, one sec
[09:43:01] <tman> iu just don't want to have to go back and do e.stopPropagation() everywhere..
[09:43:09] * tman sighs.
[09:43:28] <ryanneufeld> you can't be guaranteed that people are gonna format their input
[09:43:43] <rethus> ryanneufeld: the textarea is only an example. i got exactly this string out of parsing resultset of server-response from xml-command
[09:44:43] <ryanneufeld> so you're trying to parse this string?
[09:45:36] <BinaryKitten> rethus can the server-response give you it back in JSON or XML ?
[09:45:42] <niels__> BinaryKitten: can't use jsbin, i want to just show the source?
[09:45:47] <rethus> no
[09:46:00] <BinaryKitten> niels__ can't use jsbin??
[09:46:06] <BinaryKitten> how come?
[09:46:27] <ryanneufeld> rethus: you said it was an XML command
[09:46:45] <rethus>  ryanneufeld: no, i descibe abovve... need to get an object. first array should be the object-ffields, second array object-values.
[09:46:57] <niels__> BinaryKitten: I mean, i can - but it doesn't output the source? there's alot of php, so wouldn't work
[09:47:13] <ryanneufeld> rethus: I got that much
[09:47:22] <rethus> ryanneufeld: no, it is a result of my sending command. its only that terrible string... if i had nice clean xml, there would no needing for this function
[09:47:23] <BinaryKitten> niels__ that's a different issue
[09:47:30] <BinaryKitten> PHP is not to do with JS
[09:48:01] <ryanneufeld> rethus: do you have control of the server providing the string?
[09:48:04] <niels__> BinaryKitten: i know, i know, but how come pastebin isn't enough?
[09:48:07] <rethus> nothing changeable on this string... and u see, i have parse it down to two clean arrays
[09:48:20] <ryanneufeld> niels__: pastebin doesn't let you run the code
[09:48:32] <rethus> now i would to come more compfortable and access the value like myObject.User and myObject.audio and so on
[09:48:43] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I see what you're saying
[09:48:52] <BinaryKitten> pastebin doesn't give separation
[09:49:11] <niels__> ryanneufeld: but i can't run the code, since the php produces different divs.. in-1 in-2 etc
[09:49:20] <niels__> BinaryKitten: http://jsfiddle.net/M9PY8/
[09:49:30] <rethus> ryanneufeld:  open your firefox or webkit-debugger
[09:49:38] <rethus> you found it into the debugging-output
[09:49:44] <ryanneufeld> rethus: I
[09:49:48] <ryanneufeld> am WAY ahead of you man
[09:50:10] <ryanneufeld> rethus: is it always two lines?
[09:50:16] <ryanneufeld> or is there sometimes more?
[09:50:25] <rethus> what browser you use?
[09:50:31] <ryanneufeld> irrelevant
[09:50:43] <rethus> you opend the firebug console?
[09:50:59] <ryanneufeld> rethus: is it always two lines?
[09:51:01] <ryanneufeld> or is there sometimes more?
[09:51:22] <jacof> Hi dudes. I'm trying to set up a hover effect for a cufon font. Anyone done this ?
[09:51:40] <ryanneufeld> rethus: I've got the console under control, but to help you with your solution I need you answer my questions
[09:51:40] <BinaryKitten> niels__ can you update that fiddle with the output source not hte php
[09:51:48] <rethus> what you mean.. the value of the textarea... its always different value and count of rows
[09:51:54] <rethus> but that not the question
[09:52:03] <rethus> i keep it easy
[09:52:11] <rethus> so: i have the function map() below.
[09:52:30] <rethus> if i output the var line to console, i got twice the value of the array.
[09:52:34] <ryanneufeld> rethus: I'm gonna ask this a different way.
[09:52:42] <rethus> k.
[09:52:55] <ryanneufeld> rethus: the data that you're getting back, is the first row always the column names?
[09:53:06] <ryanneufeld> are all subsequent rows the data?
[09:53:23] <rethus> for this example, yes
[09:53:26] <ryanneufeld> is the format always tab separated values
[09:53:31] <rethus> could be one or more data-rows
[09:53:36] <ryanneufeld> that's fine
[09:53:36] <rethus> yes
[09:53:49] <desperateCoder> hello, i have a problem with my jcarousel. i want to set the start-parameter at initialisation. "... start: 3,...". this causes, that my carousel hops to the start-position after scrolling to the next element. can anybody help me?
[09:54:00] <rethus> but i didn't now, if it is exactly tabified... or only whitespaces.
[09:54:02] <ryanneufeld> okay, so you always have tab separated values, and the first row is always the key names?
[09:54:23] <ryanneufeld> is this the output of a command line program?
[09:56:10] <niels__> BinaryKitten: here: http://jsfiddle.net/M9PY8/1/
[09:56:53] <desperateCoder> no suggestions?
[09:58:56] <adac> Hi guys! how can i detect a change with a selectbox?
[09:59:01] <ryanneufeld> rethus: I think you have a harder problem to solve than you realize
[09:59:14] <ryanneufeld> ?change() @ adac
[09:59:15] <bot-t> adac, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[10:01:38] <adac> ryanneufeld, thank you!
[10:02:52] <ryanneufeld> rethus: I'm getting closer :)
[10:03:14] <adac> hmm how can I check if a certain value in a select box is selected?
[10:03:24] <ryanneufeld> ?is() @adac
[10:03:25] <bot-t> adac, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector and return true if at least one of these elements matches the selector. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[10:03:36] <ryanneufeld> ?rtfm @ adac
[10:03:36] <bot-t> adac, http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page is your friend
[10:04:23] <adac> ryanneufeld, hmm I already had this: if($('#feedback_channel_analogue_channel').is('no')) { but it doesn't seem to fire at all
[10:04:53] <ryanneufeld> adac: is(':selected')
[10:05:09] <ryanneufeld> but you need to call it on the option
[10:05:12] <ryanneufeld> not the select
[10:06:14] <adac> ryanneufeld, ok i see
[10:06:33] <t2gs> adac hey you're here too =)
[10:06:51] <adac> t2gs, I followd you :P
[10:06:52] <niels__> BinaryKitten: does it make sense? http://jsfiddle.net/M9PY8/1/
[10:07:17] <t2gs> adac I knew it was you yesterday when I was coming home, I'm calling the police lol
[10:07:48] <adac> t2gs, I'm anonymous
[10:07:50] <adac> :P
[10:08:06] <BinaryKitten> sorry niels__ having to deal with a work phonecall
[10:08:15] <_bart> niels__: Why not use $("#"+divID); ?
[10:08:31] <desperateCoder> please help! i have a problem with my jcarousel. i want to set the start-parameter at initialisation. "... start: 3,...". this causes, that my carousel hops to the start-position after scrolling to the next element. can anybody help me?
[10:08:45] <niels__> _bart: Because the id's vary, depending on the amount of rows in php
[10:09:23] <_bart> niels__: I understand, but I was aiming at the document.getElementById(divID);
[10:10:39] <_bart> niels__: like so: https://gist.github.com/485bfa9157aed0a88920
[10:10:57] * jedimind blinks
[10:11:05] <rethus> ryanneufeld: k, i'm back.
[10:11:56] <_bart> niels__: and I'd skip the if block entirely, leaving only 1 row: $("#"+divID).fadeIn(10);
[10:12:13] <rethus> ryanneufeld: isnt there a easy way to define new object-keys out of array 1 values, and set the object-data out of array2(values) ?
[10:12:27] <ryanneufeld> I don't know off the top of my head
[10:12:30] <ryanneufeld> so I'm assuming not
[10:13:33] <_bart> if you know the PHP function that does that, you might search for a javascript version of it. I know they're popular. :)
[10:14:08] <_bart> rethus: http://phpjs.org/
[10:16:33] <rethus> _bart: whats for isthis?
[10:17:47] <alexidoia> does anyone have knowledge with jqtouch and iScroll ?
[10:18:09] <_bart> rethus: PHP has alot of functions for manipulating keys and arrays, so it might save some time to just copy/paste one of the javascript versions of it.
[10:20:38] <rethus> i never asking here something about php, you mean nother person
[10:20:40] <niels__> _bart: ahh, i get it - thanks. but, could you.. somehow explain a newbie like me, how to implement the fadeout when clicked?
[10:21:09] <niels__> _bart: when another row is clicked, i want the other div to replace the current one
[10:21:56] <adac> is this still wrong ryanneufeld  if($("#myId :selected").text() == "no") {
[10:22:51] <_bart> niels__: do you have the page online?
[10:23:04] <niels__> no, its localhost
[10:23:25] <ryanneufeld> rethus: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/yGwN4/7/
[10:24:07] <ryanneufeld> adac: have you tried console.log($("#myid :selected")) ?
[10:24:30] <niels__> _bart: to be more precise, the divs start out hidden. when i click a row ex. row-6 the id-6 div has to fadein, when the user then clicks the row-4 the id-4 div has to replace the id-6 div and fadein. does that make sense?
[10:25:13] <fabiobik> $("#error").fadeIn(1000).text(json.nome);
[10:25:18] <fabiobik> its not possible?
[10:25:21] <_bart> niels__: okay, let me make an example. :)
[10:25:41] <niels__> _bart: thank you very much
[10:25:44] <tolborg> 88
[10:26:01] <ryanneufeld> fabiobik: $("#error").text(json.nome).fadeIn(1000);
[10:26:05] <adac> ryanneufeld, where does it output the log?
[10:26:17] <ryanneufeld> ?console @ adac
[10:26:17] <bot-t> adac, Firebug and the Command Line - http://getfirebug.com/commandline
[10:26:22] <ryanneufeld> ?ftj @ adac
[10:26:23] <bot-t> adac, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[10:26:24] <rethus> ryanneufeld: how did you get the firebug on this panel
[10:26:26] <adac> ryanneufeld, ok
[10:26:52] <ryanneufeld> rethus: if you choose jquery edge, you can have it include firebug lite as well
[10:26:55] <fabiobik> ryanneufeld still not work
[10:26:56] <ryanneufeld> see on the left
[10:27:17] <fabiobik> ryanneufeld  success: function(json) {
[10:27:18] <fabiobik>          		    	
[10:27:18] <fabiobik>          		    	 $("#error").text(json.nome).fadeIn(10000);
[10:27:18] <fabiobik>          		  }
[10:27:45] <rethus> cool
[10:27:54] <ryanneufeld> you want it to take 10 seconds to fade in?
[10:28:08] <fabiobik> ryanneufeld ive put 1000 but dont work
[10:28:16] <ryanneufeld> try with no value
[10:28:23] <ryanneufeld> also, is the error hidden?
[10:28:25] <rethus> ryanneufeld: great example. thanks
[10:28:29] <ryanneufeld> does it add the text?
[10:28:49] <ryanneufeld> rethus:  np, you have a tougher problem to solve since your output is irregular
[10:29:00] <fabiobik> ryanneufeld yes add the test in all ways
[10:29:04] <ryanneufeld> k
[10:29:13] <ryanneufeld> is error hidden ?
[10:29:27] <ryanneufeld> it needs to be display:none before fading in will do anything
[10:30:12] <adac> ryanseddon, I had wrong div checked (:
[10:30:14] <adac> thank you!

[10:33:43] <niels__> _bart: thank you, i will try it out - once i have consumed this pizza :)
[10:34:18] <khurram> hi
[10:34:43] <_bart> hi
[10:35:09] <jedimind> i think your script is broken _bart  it always returns "fabio"
[10:35:09] <jedimind> :)
[10:35:12] <king313> hi guys, any jquery recommended book(s)?
[10:35:53] <_bart> jedimind: Who or what is "fabio"? :)
[10:37:07] <khurram> i am having problem with json  my jquery json when i console.log shows the id number and the data in console.log perfectly alright but when i try to access it it gives an error id not defined and problem is id is defined in firebug
[10:37:10] <fabiobik> what fabio
[10:37:13] <fabiobik> im fabio
[10:37:14] <fabiobik> xD
[10:37:52] <khurram> all the rest of the id i am able to access and display accept with couple of id values
[10:38:21] <_bart> fabiobik: I think I missed a joke or something. :)
[10:38:24] <jedimind> _bart, see, fabiobik is Fabio
[10:38:43] <jedimind> oh , sorry _bart  my bad
[10:38:48] <jedimind> it was fabiobik that pasted the url, i read it as you
[10:38:51] <jedimind> ignore me
[10:39:42] <fabiobik> oh sorry
[10:39:46] <fabiobik> what you said?
[10:39:52] <_bart> ah I see. :)
[10:40:08] <jedimind> fabiobik, nothing intelligent
[10:40:21] <fabiobik> lol
[10:41:20] <_bart> Hm there's no way to "unprivate" a gist..
[10:47:23] <jacof> hey there. i'm need a p element to change its color when hovering the containing div. <div class="1"><p class="2"></p></div> ?
[10:47:56] <jacof> i've seen http://api.jquery.com/hover/ but i can't make much out of that
[10:49:48] <jacof> _bart: lets assume i only have classes, no ids
[10:49:52] <_bart> jacof: I just sent you the line, but you have to know what $(this) can mean for you.
[10:51:03] <_bart> jacof: while something like: ("div.someclass").hover(function () { $('#idofp').css("color", "white"); }, function() { $('#idofp').css("color", "pink"); });  might work, it doesn't look like a reallife snippet to me.
[10:51:44] <jacof> looks more surrealistic to me
[10:52:01] <jacof> heh,.. why is the color for p defined twice ?
[10:53:43] <jacof> i see..
[10:53:50] <jacof> mouseenter mouseleave
[10:55:20] <jacof> ok but how do I address the p element given it's class and not it's id ?
[10:58:44] <Zucca> Is there a way to do like jQuery.getScript() does but _without_ ajax? Reason for this is because in some cases this must work also locally (without web server).
[11:05:34] <abjorn> anyone else read this "Node.js is Backwards" blog post?
[11:08:34] <shesek> Zucca, IIRC it uses a regular <script> element when you use JSONP as the data type
[11:11:28] <khurram> hello
[11:11:33] <abjorn> hi!
[11:11:34] <Zucca> Hm. Ok. Thanks shesek. :)
[11:11:50] <khurram> why my alert is not working http://jsfiddle.net/2YvgX/
[11:13:29] <khurram> can any one read my messages here ?
[11:14:51] <khurram> hi every one
[11:15:11] <khurram> can some please tell me wats wrong with these three lines of code http://jsfiddle.net/2YvgX/
[11:15:56] <ravenzz> khurram try to validate your json on http://jsonlint.com/
[11:17:36] <niels__> _bart: wow, it works. thank you so much. but, instead of fadeout, could i just hide it? it lags a bit when a new row is clicked, so it pushed the div down, before fading in?
[11:17:44] <khurram> ravenzz: i did it but its giving syntax error now have a look http://jsfiddle.net/2YvgX/1/
[11:18:10] <_bart> niels__: cool. :) replace the .fadeOut("fast"); with .hide();
[11:18:36] <_bart> niels__: and I hope you see how easy jQuery really is. It's all the same and so easy once you know how.
[11:19:30] <niels__> _bart: i'm amazed, really. but it'll take me hundreds of hours before i fully understand ;)
[11:19:56] <ravenzz> khurram http://jsfiddle.net/2YvgX/3/
[11:20:29] <ravenzz> khurram or http://jsfiddle.net/2YvgX/5/
[11:20:45] <khurram> so i should not have qout is that was the problem
[11:20:50] <_bart> niels__: I found jQuery one of the most fun things to learn, there are alot of code examples like the one I wrote for you in the docs: http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page
[11:21:12] <khurram> but 70 other tags are working fine with quot except this one ?\
[11:21:25] <smykes24> how can i make a variable into a familiar operator?
[11:21:44] <ravenzz> khurram basically you forgot to load jQuery on your fiddle ;)
[11:22:20] <khurram> ravenzz: can u please explain me what was the problem the quote or some thing else ?
[11:22:43] <niels__> _bart: thanks, i will have a look
[11:23:36] <ravenzz> khurram so in the first fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/2YvgX/) you don't select the jQuery framework from de left sidebar
[11:24:34] <niels__> _bart: a different matter, do you have any idea why the css "cursor: pointer;" doesn't work properly all the time? 1/4 of the time it just shows the regular arrow cursor when hovering over.
[11:24:56] <_bart> niels__: I have an exam tomorrow, electronic circuits. :(
[11:25:43] <_bart> niels__: (I'm a physics student) so don't have to time to help you out right now, sorry.
[11:25:48] <ravenzz> khurram why you are replacing any quote with &quot; ?
[11:26:12] <abjorn> http://blog.ankurgoyal.com/post/6433642218/node-js-is-backwards#comment-228789598 lol'd so much
[11:26:14] <khurram> ravenzz: still not working http://jsfiddle.net/2YvgX/6/
[11:26:43] <niels__> _bart: ah i see. good luck :)
[11:26:44] <smykes24> anyone?  making a .val() into a familar operator?
[11:27:00] <khurram> ravenzz: i am fetching big data from the db and displaying it in the content pane as per the option id all other id get displayed accept this one and i dont know whats wrong with this one
[11:27:12] <_bart> niels__: thanks, I hate electronic circuits and I'm hoping for a miracle. :)
[11:28:10] <ravenzz> khurram test[0].tag_name
[11:28:10] <niels__> _bart: i know the feeling, just get it over with :)
[11:28:35] <ravenzz> khurram http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[11:32:00] <smykes24> hrm
[11:32:25] <rethus> can i directly trim all values, which are split with:  response.split("\n"); ?
[11:32:48] <khurram> ravenzz: i use the htmlspecialchar ( json_encode( my_data) )
[11:36:16] <fra79Wii> Hi guys, I need do retrieve some xml files from a public server to my web application. I would like to do it only in client side, the files are tiny, but right now I have to gei it wit php and serve it to jquery. I was thinking if someone have a workaround... a reallu ugly solution might be have a java applet that download the files (I don't like because then users have to install java..etc..)
[11:36:42] <khurram> now i have started getting errror:  Invalid Chorom URI:  /a.. what does that mean ?
[11:37:07] <smykes24> fra79Wii: is the coe on the server?
[11:37:11] <smykes24> could you use ajax?
[11:37:43] <fra79Wii> smykes24: no it would be a cross-site stuff... I hate that...
[11:39:10] <smykes24> hate what stuff?
[11:40:19] <rethus> ryanneufeld:  why does my replace command didn't work here? http://jsfiddle.net/yGwN4/8/
[11:41:16] <fra79Wii> yes, sorry, that I can't get the xml directly with ajax, I had a cross-domain error, I didn't write it down, but I "solved" by retriving the file on my server and serve it to my application.. but it's a bit annoying to involve the server on this task...
[11:41:52] <rethus> why does my replace command didn't work here? http://jsfiddle.net/yGwN4/8/
[11:45:34] <fra79Wii> OK, got t, how do you guys work around to a Cross-site XMLHttpRequest wit jquery?
[11:51:00] <smykes24> fra79Wii: there's a way i just cant remember how to do it as i have never done it
[11:52:06] <fra79Wii> hmm, probably I've found some infos about it, google is cool when you type the right words :)
[11:52:19] <fra79Wii> http://www.oriontransfer.co.nz/blog/2011-05/cross-domain-ajax/index
[11:53:52] <smykes24> ok dumb question
[11:54:01] <smykes24> how do i make my variables into integers
[11:54:07] <smykes24> so i can add them
[11:54:47] <fra79Wii>  parseInt(string(
[11:54:50] <fra79Wii> )
[11:55:09] <fra79Wii> maybe.. i Think it's plain javascript
[11:55:22] <smykes24> so like
[11:55:22] <smykes24> var slotFour = parseInt(string(slotOne + slotTwo + slotThree));
[11:56:17] <fra79Wii> of parseFloat if you want floats
[11:56:34] <smykes24> are all ints floats?
[11:57:24] <fra79Wii> or not of.. sorry I can't type a post right today..
[11:58:34] <fra79Wii> I think you can do slotFour = parseInt(slotOne)+parseInt(slotTwo)+...
[11:58:45] <Mobbb> hey, i have an issue with my script http://pastebin.com/8Q814V1P when i select the 11th and 12th month my div doesnt get hidden
[11:59:06] <Mobbb>  <a>IMG</a> thats the a div
[12:02:01] <Mobbb> anyone around to help me?
[12:02:07] <smykes24> fra79Wii: yeah that worked
[12:02:28] <smykes24> ty
[12:02:48] <cirwin> Mobbb: alert(month); at the top
[12:02:55] <cirwin> (just after line 3)
[12:03:13] <cirwin> I think it's not what you expect
[12:03:33] <smykes24> fra79Wii: any idea how to turn a string into an operator?
[12:03:34] <cirwin> also, you should look into case-statements
[12:04:01] <smykes24> or at least if else
[12:04:10] <smykes24> thats going to hit everyone no matter what
[12:04:15] <smykes24> with if else it will at least stop
[12:04:19] <Mobbb> the alert works fine
[12:04:36] <DuckyX> can someone direct me to some good examples of how to use draggable/droppable for doing something like image creation (like a business card)
[12:04:47] <cirwin> ok
[12:04:53] <cirwin> Mobbb: you said you wanted your div hidden
[12:05:00] <cirwin> but the code hides an anchor
[12:05:14] <cirwin> smykes24: string into an operator? like "+" -> + ?
[12:05:15] <smykes24> DuckyX: only think i know about is the documentation on the jquery ui site
[12:05:21] <smykes24> cirwin yes
[12:05:21] <Mobbb> i know im using it to hide another menu butt i wanted to hide text to test
[12:05:33] <smykes24> im getting the operator from a .val()
[12:05:33] <cirwin> smykes24: there's a library for that
[12:05:38] <cirwin> I cna't remember what it's called
[12:05:46] <smykes24> i need a library really?
[12:05:51] <smykes24> its a basic calculator
[12:05:59] <cirwin> smykes24: well, you can just use eval :p
[12:06:20] <smykes24> ive never used that before
[12:06:23] * smykes24 googles
[12:06:24] <cirwin> eval(1 + "+" + 2)
[12:06:40] <smykes24> hrm
[12:06:45] <smykes24> and use if statements?
[12:06:53] <cirwin> any javascript code works
[12:06:55] <smykes24> if (.val == +)
[12:07:01] <fra79Wii> damn, ajax stlill this error... is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[12:07:27] <cirwin> fra79Wii: ajax only works on the same domain as the website
[12:07:45] <cirwin> smykes24: there's a library that turns strings like '+' into functions
[12:07:57] <cirwin> but eval is probably what you're looking for
[12:08:08] <smykes24> cirwin ty sir you are a gentlemen and a scholar
[12:08:18] <Mobbb>  $("asd").hide("slow"); fails too
[12:08:41] <cirwin> Mobbb: well, of course it doesn't, you don't have any <asd> tags :p
[12:09:14] <Mobbb> i do :P
[12:09:19] <Mobbb>  <asd>IMG</asd>
[12:09:34] <cirwin> hm, I can recommend not doing that :p
[12:10:01] <Mobbb> i just need to get it to owrk haha
[12:10:04] <Mobbb> work*
[12:11:41] <Mobbb> grr its anoying haha
[12:12:02] <cirwin> change your <asd> to a <div class="asd">
[12:12:13] <cirwin> then run jQuery(".asd").hide()
[12:13:40] <Mobbb> didnt work
[12:14:18] <cirwin> if you put an alert on the line after that code, does the alert happen?
[12:15:02] <Mobbb> nope
[12:15:18] <cirwin> so that line isn't getting called either
[12:15:30] <cirwin> there are two possibilities, either the if doesn't match
[12:15:34] <cirwin> or there's an error
[12:15:35] <fra79Wii> cirwin: yes I've notice... I was wondering if there is a way to handle it...I've seen this now http://www.oriontransfer.co.nz/blog/2011-05/cross-domain-ajax/index
[12:15:46] <iman> Hi, how can I declare an action on press 'Enter' Key
[12:15:56] <fra79Wii> hope it works...
[12:16:10] <smykes24> iman: you hav to find out the ascii code for enter
[12:16:19] <smykes24> in all the diff browsers
[12:16:20] <cirwin> Mobbb: you can check for an error by looking in the developer console for errors
[12:16:22] <smykes24> its a nice pita
[12:17:04] <iman> how can I declare to get this action ?
[12:17:05] <cirwin> fra79Wii: .keydown(function () {if (e.keyCode === 13)
[12:17:27] <smykes24> cirwin you pointed at the wrong user thats for iman
[12:17:37] <smykes24> cirwin: doesnt IE use a diff keyCode?
[12:17:42] <cirwin> I don't think so
[12:17:48] <Mobbb> what developer console?
[12:17:55] <cirwin> Mobbb: what browser are you using?
[12:17:56] <smykes24> i remember running into bs with that cirwin
[12:18:00] <Mobbb> gooogle chrome
[12:18:17] <cirwin> Mobbb: rigth click on your element and click "inspect element"
[12:18:26] <cirwin> you'll get some magic wizardry at the bottom of the page
[12:18:28] <plov> on successful ajax get i'd like to replace say all texts in <div id="data"> which api do i use?
[12:18:28] <cirwin> click on "Console"
[12:18:35] <cirwin> if there's red text there, it means an error
[12:18:38] <Z3R0> tryinig to find a jquery to change the css properties of an element
[12:18:43] <Z3R0> I've only found .css() which retrieves
[12:19:00] <cirwin> Z3R0: foo.css({color: 'red'})
[12:19:05] <smykes24> Z3R0: css writes too
[12:19:06] <Z3R0> ah ok thanks
[12:19:17] <Z3R0> ya the doc wasn't quite clear on it
[12:19:18] <Gambit-> hey guys
[12:19:23] <smykes24> or ('color', 'red'
[12:19:45] <Mobbb> nope
[12:19:47] <Mobbb> no warnings
[12:19:49] <Mobbb> or errors
[12:20:00] <cirwin> Mobbb: ok, in that case your if statements are wrong
[12:20:02] <Gambit-> I'm trying to write a chrome extension that uses jquery, but despite having a "js: jquery.js" type line in my json file, I don't seem to have '$' nor 'jQuery' defined.  Any suggestions?
[12:20:07] <smykes24> Z3R0: make sure you dont put the ; after the second argument
[12:20:15] <Z3R0> hmmm...
[12:20:28] <smykes24> so dont do 'color', 'red;'
[12:20:30] <smykes24> wont work
[12:20:36] <Z3R0> hmmm...
[12:20:57] <Mobbb> how can my if statements be wrong if its checking for a value?
[12:21:01] <cirwin> Gambit-: where are you looking for it? I presume you've checked that your manifest is valid
[12:21:04] <Z3R0> $(d).css({background-color: '#000000'}); // Says there's an error
[12:21:06] <Mobbb> i mean its checking the value of what the selection is
[12:21:21] <Z3R0> d is sent to the function as (this)
[12:21:21] <cirwin> Mobbb: there are two possible issues
[12:21:25] <Gambit-> cirwin, I wouldn't presume anything; how can I check if my manifest is valid?
[12:21:28] <cirwin> 1. you're using .text() which returns a string
[12:21:39] <smykes24> z3RO
[12:21:49] <cirwin> and 2. you're returning .text() which is what's displayed, not the value
[12:21:56] <smykes24> 'background-color' , '#00000'
[12:22:08] <Z3R0> trying
[12:22:16] <cirwin> Gambit-: ugh, it's been too long, put it through a JSON validator as the first step
[12:22:25] <Z3R0> hmmm netbeans is still throwing an error
[12:22:34] <cirwin> it doesn't like js: with no quotes for example
[12:22:50] <Gambit-> cirwin, oh, yeah, that was just a shorthand notation.
[12:22:53] <smykes24> netbeans havent heard that in like 10 years
[12:22:59] <Mobbb> foxed
[12:23:00] <Z3R0> ya it halts all my scripts
[12:23:00] <Mobbb> fixed :P
[12:23:02] <Gambit-> cirwin, it comes out as valid json.
[12:23:08] <Z3R0> nvm forgot a '
[12:23:16] <cirwin> Mobbb: what was it?
[12:23:24] <cirwin> Gambit-: cool, where are you hoping to see jQuery?
[12:23:24] <Mobbb> the .val
[12:23:26] <smykes24> z3ro you need like '.d'
[12:23:29] <smykes24> or #d
[12:23:37] <Z3R0> hmmm...
[12:23:40] <cirwin> Mobbb: I thought I told you to alert(month) ages ago :p
[12:23:42] <Z3R0> how can I dynamically reference the item then ?
[12:23:45] <Mobbb> it was a stupid mistake haha
[12:23:45] <Gambit-> cirwin, how should I answer that?  At the top of my extension?  Let me put the code up.
[12:23:49] <Mobbb> no it alerted fine
[12:23:50] <Mobbb> on line 3
[12:23:57] <smykes24> z3ro you can try 'this'
[12:23:57] <Z3R0> My function
[12:23:57] <cirwin> oh ok
[12:23:58] <Z3R0> onkeyup="checkLength(this.value,4,8,this)"
[12:24:02] <smykes24> depending on what you are doing
[12:24:07] <Gambit-> cirwin, is there a good pastebin, btw?
[12:24:15] <cirwin> Gambit-: not that I know of :p
[12:24:15] <smykes24> are you doing validation Z3R0
[12:24:20] <Z3R0> sending the current text, min, max, TextField
[12:24:21] <Z3R0> yes
[12:24:33] <smykes24> and what you are making the input box red?
[12:24:38] <cirwin> this channel seems to like jsfiddle.net
[12:24:43] <Z3R0> right now, just fiddling with the bgcolor
[12:24:48] <Z3R0> green for good / red for bad
[12:25:03] <smykes24> if you are doing something with the input box you can use $(this)
[12:25:04] <Z3R0> but eventually it will be an image swap for a 'X' and a 'Check'
[12:25:09] <smykes24> because your function is on that box
[12:25:15] <Mobbb> thanks cirwin
[12:25:16] <Z3R0> wait what?
[12:25:26] <Mobbb> also whats the difference between a Div and a div class ?
[12:25:34] <smykes24> ok so you have an input box
[12:25:40] <cirwin> Mobbb: Uh..
[12:25:46] <Z3R0> right, input box 'text' id='fname' name='fname'
[12:25:53] <smykes24> an you are doing $("#inputBox").keyUp(function()
[12:25:59] <cirwin> all divs are tags like <div>
[12:26:07] <cirwin> any HTML can have a class="asd"
[12:26:13] <rethus> i have an javascript-array with two objects.
[12:26:24] <Gambit-> cirwin, json at http://pastebin.com/n6gt1uRP, javascript header stolen from some firefox code at http://pastebin.com/fqEffysQ
[12:26:31] <Z3R0> smykes24 can I pm you?
[12:26:31] <rethus> the object has user = 1 and channel =2
[12:26:37] <smykes24> Z3R0: yeah
[12:26:40] <Z3R0> thanks
[12:26:44] <Mobbb> ohh i see..
[12:26:53] <rethus> how can i access on the value Channel inside the object which are into the array?
[12:27:02] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/yGwN4/10/
[12:27:02] <Mobbb> im pretty new to jquery
[12:27:31] <rethus> result_array[1].Channel seems not to work... same like result_array[1].obj.Channel
[12:27:34] <Gambit-> cirwin, not too complicated, as you can see; but '$', 'jQuery', 'unsafeWindow.jQuery' are all undefined.
[12:27:47] <cirwin> Gambit-: unsafeWindow is a firefox concept
[12:28:33] <Gambit-> cirwin, surely; I'm open to alternatives or better/smarter ways of doing things.  I don't think I actually use unsafeWindow except in the gettings of the jQuery object.
[12:28:45] <cirwin> also, you want to put jquery into the same content_scripts object as the script.js
[12:28:49] <rethus> ah, see, there was a whitespace in the object-var
[12:28:56] <cirwin> Gambit-: well... maybe that's why it's not working :p
[12:29:17] <Gambit-> cirwin, debugger says that unsafeWindow is defined, but jquery is not, so yeah, that's my question :)
[12:29:32] <Gambit-> Do you mean collapsing the json clause to look something like... *typing*
[12:31:00] <Gambit-> http://pastebin.com/7S3ChtnP?
[12:31:12] <Gambit-> whups, nuke the top content_scripts section.
[12:31:18] <cirwin> yes
[12:31:27] <cirwin> you don't need jquery.com in there though
[12:31:30] <Gambit-> literally like that?
[12:31:32] <cirwin> you should have a local copy of jquery
[12:31:37] <Gambit-> how does it know to get jquery.js from... ah.
[12:31:41] <cirwin> :)
[12:32:22] <Mobbb> im using a month drop down menu and i want the days to update in reaction to what month like 1 - 28 or 1- 31 etc
[12:32:23] <Gambit-> do you know of an easier way to reload an extension than to restart chrome, btw?
[12:32:31] <samuelj> Hey, can someone help me? In the following code, on submit, the post is working fine, but nothing is happening for the callback. Not even the class 'currentEdit' is being added. Is this some sort of syntax error? My pastie is here: http://pastebin.com/T0ZrBsj5
[12:32:32] <Mobbb> is there a easier way to do it rather then hiding and showing different menus ?
[12:32:36] <cirwin> Gambit-: sure, go to chrome://extensions
[12:32:39] <cirwin> enable developer mode
[12:32:43] <cirwin> load it as an unpacked extension
[12:32:49] <cirwin> and then click the "reload" button
[12:33:04] <LolZy> Hey Z3R0 xD
[12:33:49] <Gambit-> hm
[12:33:54] <Gambit-> it says the manifest file is unreadible
[12:33:57] <Gambit-> *tries again*
[12:34:26] <samuelj> Any suggestions? This has been bugging me for ages!
[12:35:39] <cirwin> Gambit-: is the "converted from user script" field valid?
[12:35:49] <cirwin> http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/manifest.html
[12:36:02] <Gambit-> cirwin, I didn't make that field; it came in from the drag-and-drop of a greasemonkey .js file.
[12:36:23] <cirwin> uh..
[12:36:52] <Gambit-> ah, got that fixed
[12:36:59] <Gambit-> (i'd bumped my version number idiotically)
[12:37:07] <Gambit-> now it says "could not load javascript 'jquery.js'
[12:37:35] <cirwin> did you download jquery and put it in a file called jquery.js? :p
[12:38:10] <Gambit-> oh, huh, uhm, let me recover really fast, just a moment.
[12:38:23] <cirwin> :)
[12:38:38] <Gambit-> (I 'removed' the extension, and unsurprisingly it deleted some of the files.
[12:40:57] <samuelj> Ahhh this is stressing me out so much! http://pastebin.com/T0ZrBsj5 Can anyone take a look at this for me? I'd love you guys forever :)
[12:40:57] <Gambit-> hookay
[12:41:04] <Gambit-> that looks more useful, let's try this again.
[12:41:53] <Gambit-> heeey huzzah
[12:42:00] <Gambit-> mysterious brokenness is now working.
[12:42:03] <cirwin> yay
[12:42:10] <Gambit-> cheers cirwin :)
[12:42:25] <cirwin> samuelj: is the post request succeeding?
[12:42:34] <samuelj> cirwin: yeah it works fine
[12:42:44] <samuelj> cirwin: and the json object returns to
[12:42:46] <samuelj> *too
[12:42:47] <cirwin> oh
[12:42:49] <cirwin> $(this)
[12:42:52] <cirwin> inside the post callback
[12:42:58] <cirwin> is not the form anymore
[12:43:02] <cirwin> it's the jquery ajax response
[12:43:21] <cirwin> better to take a copy at the top of the submit function
[12:43:40] <Gambit-> now, next question!
[12:43:45] <samuelj> so, var x = $(this) cirwin
[12:44:19] <cirwin> samuelj: var form = $(this), yes
[12:44:27] <samuelj> cirwin: thanks
[12:44:39] <Gambit-> For a site like http://www.redfin.com/WA/Auburn/710-Henry-Rd-98002/home/2068572, I want to find the text blob that matches "Total Expenses: (\$[0-9,]*)" and do an alert(...) on the value.  Is there an easy way to do this with jquery?
[12:45:38] <cirwin> Gambit-: 'fraid not — I don't think there's a selector for "text matching"
[12:45:48] <cirwin> you can just use $("body").html(), but...,
[12:45:57] <Gambit-> performance is not an issue here...
[12:45:58] <cirwin> maybe it's a bit ugly
[12:46:00] <devinrolsen> umm what about contains()
[12:46:06] <devinrolsen> it text matches.
[12:46:08] <Gambit-> so could I do a javascript regex against $("body").html()?
[12:46:12] <cirwin> ooh
[12:46:13] <samuelj> cirwin:  that worked perfect, thanks for all your help :)
[12:46:31] <Gambit-> devinrolsen, Would you spoonfeed me just a *tiny* bit and show me a snippet? :)
[12:46:56] <cirwin> samuelj: np, "this" is always a problem :)
[12:46:56] <Bodu> hello. my jquery doesnt parse the json data. i see the json response in firebug but jquery doesnt use it. why? thanks! http://stikked.com/view/35683952
[12:47:26] <cirwin> Bodu: data is not defined
[12:47:36] <cirwin> you need the success function to have an argument
[12:47:47] <Bodu> where should i do this? and how?
[12:47:48] <cirwin> use jslint
[12:47:53] <cirwin> it will tell you about these problems :p
[12:48:00] <cirwin> line 18
[12:48:05] <cirwin> function () { ---> function (data) {
[12:48:36] <devinrolsen> Gambit - not tested, but it would be something like $(first one).next('li:contains('What Ever')');
[12:48:41] <CyberKatze> hi ppl... it is possible to make callback_function for Form_Submit  ???????????
[12:49:02] <Bodu> cirwin:thanks alot
[12:49:31] <cirwin> CyberKatze: of course
[12:49:40] <cirwin> oh, well
[12:49:42] <cirwin> not directly
[12:49:44] <devinrolsen> $('first one').next("li:contains('What Ever')"); - Sorry Gambit, use double quotes with singles like this.
[12:49:48] <cirwin> you have to post the form using jquery
[12:49:57] <cirwin> if you actually post the form, a new page will load
[12:50:20] <CyberKatze> cirwin... yes.. but i have in form input type=file.....
[12:50:23] <Cork[home]> devinrolsen: you would want to use nextAll there, else it will only return it if its the very next one
[12:50:42] <devinrolsen> no sorry I read wrong, not nextAll or even next but find()
[12:50:48] <devinrolsen> I thought he wanted the next one.
[12:51:10] <cirwin> CyberKatze: there are techniques for that
[12:51:16] <cirwin> but they're quite fiddly
[12:51:29] <cirwin> why not just pass a URL parameter to the page on the other side of the post
[12:51:35] <cirwin> so you can do cool stuff there
[12:51:38] <g0bl1n> ryanneufeld, gnarf  setting MIME type to application/json works now on 1.6.1. Worked with application/javascript with 1.4.3. No longer. Makes sense.
[12:51:56] <g0bl1n> thanks
[12:52:13] <g0bl1n> dataType: 'json'
[12:52:16] <g0bl1n> all working now
[12:53:43] <logansrun> hey bros how do i style this slider with 2 png files i have
[12:53:49] <logansrun> http://predrinksradio.com/youtubedj
[12:54:10] <logansrun> i have an icon for the background and one for the like slider
[13:00:49] <jacof> why isn't this working on firefox ? $(".showcasewrap",this).css("color", "#ffffff !important");
[13:01:24] <CyberKatze> it is possible with $.post() text.file (input type="file") from Form in script senden?????
[13:01:39] <luchenbill> how can I get 3 images to fade in and out?
[13:01:42] <luchenbill> like a slide show?
[13:03:12] <_bart> jacof: I think it doesn't work because the selector $(".showcasewrap", this) isn't correct.
[13:03:51] <jacof> _bart: works perfectly in other browsers, though
[13:03:54] <_bart> jacof: .css("colors", "#fff !important");, that part looks fine to me.
[13:03:55] <snover> CyberKatze: no.
[13:03:57] <jacof> what is your suggestion
[13:04:03] <jacof> colors ?
[13:04:10] <_bart> ehm, "color" indeed :)
[13:04:19] <jacof> dup
[13:04:33] <jacof> maybe its a css thing ?
[13:04:44] <jacof> and ff can't replace the color fotr the item ?
[13:05:04] <snover> jacof: if you need to use !important you are doing something very very wrong
[13:05:04] <_bart> Yea maybe, and I don't know the context that line is in (refering to this).
[13:05:15] <jacof> how would i make inner elements in one of those selectors ? $(".showcasewrap p") <- possible ?
[13:05:22] <_bart> !important should not be needed.
[13:05:35] <jacof> its a long story :)
[13:05:36] <Zucca> Does there exist .ready() for variables? Meaning basically when variable != undefined then run some function.
[13:05:51] <logansrun> is it possible to stlye a slider
[13:05:55] <logansrun> with an image in the background
[13:06:00] <logansrun> and another for the slider button
[13:06:07] <_bart> jacof: It's not really, by setting .css("color") you override the current value, thus !important is not necessary.
[13:06:10] <luchenbill> could anyone help me please?
[13:06:14] <Cork[home]> Zucca: no theres no even when variables are changed
[13:07:09] <Zucca> Cork[home]: Then I'll have to make my own. :) Thanks!
[13:07:11] <Cork[home]> Zucca: there will be a way to do it in a few years, but its far from cross browser supported right now
[13:07:24] <Zucca> Ah...
[13:07:41] <Cork[home]> (object setters (ecmascript 5))
[13:08:17] <jacof> _bart: allrighty.. !important out
[13:08:38] <jacof> nope. .
[13:08:40] <Gambit-> whups, had to step asside.
[13:08:48] <Cork[home]> Zucca: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide:Creating_New_Objects:Defining_Getters_and_Setters
[13:08:51] <jacof> i need that !important, cause there's a style="" definition there
[13:09:22] <_bart> jacof: .css should override those too. Odd..
[13:09:24] <Zucca> Cork[home]: Hmmm...
[13:09:37] <Gambit-> cirwin, I'm not really sure how the nextall would work there.  Do I do something like $('body').nextAll("li:contains('Total Expenses: ')");?
[13:09:43] <jacof> wanna check it out ?
[13:09:44] <jacof> http://www.desertkingchile.cl/dbym_dev2/
[13:09:53] <jacof> hover over the "+"'s
[13:10:02] <jacof> works in chrome, safari, opera
[13:10:07] <jacof> scared to try in ie
[13:11:28] <jacof> it's just not getting there
[13:11:52] <_bart> jacof, around your $('.showcase-buttons') you got "jQuery(function($) {"
[13:12:07] <jacof> wow in ie is worst than i thought
[13:12:09] <jacof> yeah _bart
[13:12:16] <_bart> jacof: I'd replace that with  $(document).ready(function() {    /* all your jquery stuff */ });
[13:12:18] <jacof> it does other things too.. and they all work ok
[13:12:35] <jacof> it's a hover, in fact
[13:12:38] <BinaryKitten> _bart that's not actually good advice
[13:12:42] <_bart> oh
[13:12:44] <Zucca> Cork[home]: So creating a setTimeout -loop to check fi variable != undefined isn't going to work on all browsers?
[13:12:51] <BinaryKitten> jQuery(function($) {   is the same thing
[13:12:52] <_bart> normally I place my js before </body>
[13:12:59] <BinaryKitten> but smaller and more direct
[13:12:59] <_bart> exactly the same thing?
[13:13:01] <BinaryKitten> yes
[13:13:03] <jacof> http://pastebin.com/bFT6JWPQ
[13:13:04] <jacof> this is it
[13:13:09] <Cork[home]> Zucca: it will, but its a terrible way to do it
[13:13:21] <BinaryKitten> jQuery = $   jQuery(function   = $(function   = $(document).ready(function
[13:13:31] <Cork[home]> Zucca: that will keep computers from going into sleep mode if your page is loaded, and things like that
[13:13:44] <Cork[home]> just for checking if a variable is set :s
[13:14:05] <_bart> BinaryKitten: Ah okay, but the best thing is to just not use it and place your javascript right before the end of body right?
[13:14:11] <jacof> _bart: color setting not working in ff, color setting & background color to transparent on mouseleave not working in ie,
[13:14:15] <Zucca> Cork[home]: I know it's terrible. :\
[13:14:18] <Cork[home]> Zucca: can't you just wrap the variable in a function and set it from there?
[13:14:23] <Cork[home]> that way you will know if its set
[13:14:28] <BinaryKitten> _bart actually not precisely
[13:14:43] <Cork[home]> Zucca: btw what are you trying to do?
[13:14:52] <BinaryKitten> placing a document ready at the end is not bad either especially if you're using $
[13:15:21] <_bart> BinaryKitten: it prevents the execution of scripts using $ without jQuery being loaded?
[13:15:29] <BinaryKitten> nope..
[13:15:35] <_bart> What's the reason then? :)
[13:15:39] <BinaryKitten> it makes sure that our $ is Jquery
[13:15:40] <jacof> damn now not working in chroem
[13:15:56] <BinaryKitten> time for food.. bbs
[13:15:57] <CyberKatze>  it is possible with $.post() text.file (input type="file") from Form in script senden?????
[13:16:02] <Zucca> Cork[home]: Well... My problem is inclusion of other scripts and running functions when those are loaded. This all must work locally (without web server) too.
[13:16:03] <_bart> BinaryKitten: ah, like a local noConflict()?
[13:16:13] <_bart> okay
[13:16:38] <BinaryKitten> _bart yes.. but without needing the noConflict etc
[13:16:51] <Cork[home]> Zucca: thats normally dune by useing a function to include the script, and scoping each script well
[13:16:54] <_bart> BinaryKitten, okay cool, makes sense. :)
[13:17:13] <Cork[home]> Zucca: that way you only have to check when the script is loaded
[13:18:10] <jacof> yup... ie & ff nt responding.. safari chrome opera ok
[13:18:43] <Zucca> Cork[home]: I have a little project that creates HTML pages. those pages must work normally locally too. Ie if those pages were a manual for certain application that's shipped with CD or other media.
[13:18:45] <Gambit-> http://www.redfin.com/WA/Auburn/710-Henry-Rd-98002/home/2068572 I'm trying to get the text value of the line item that starts with 'Gross Scheduled Income'.  I thought I could begin with $('Amenities'), and use nextAll, but that doesn't seem to be doing anything remotely functional.  Suggestions?
[13:20:01] <Zucca> Cork[home]: And I tried $.getScript() already. It does not work. :(
[13:20:07] <Gambit-> trying to do .next() on that just gives me a type error on 'undefined_method'.
[13:20:12] <Cork[home]> Zucca: what kind of variable is it your checking?
[13:20:16] <Gambit-> which makes me feel like I don't have jquery loaded, but '$' is defined.
[13:20:35] <Cork[home]> Zucca: your using its callback?
[13:20:44] <Cork[home]> cause that would work if you do
[13:21:00] <jacof> yeahhhhhhh!
[13:21:09] <jacof> got all the !importants out to the trash
[13:21:13] <jacof> and tada :)
[13:21:43] <jacof> snover was right
[13:21:54] <jacof> there were some mixing about whos more important here
[13:22:17] <Zucca> Cork[home]: $.getScript('data/myscript.js', function() { alert('foo') } );  <--- does not alert
[13:22:47] <Zucca> Cork[home]: Oh and after alert there's ;  :)
[13:23:14] <snover> Zucca: then chances are the script you are loading has an error in it or does not exist
[13:23:17] <Cork[home]> Zucca: doesn't matte
[13:23:22] <Cork[home]> +r
[13:23:29] <Zucca> Hm...
[13:23:43] <Cork[home]> Zucca: but ya, that event should be called
[13:23:52] <Cork[home]> with or without the ; :)
[13:24:04] <Zucca> Ok. I need to double-check everything...
[13:41:13] <abjorn> <3 nodeunit
[13:43:53] <rethus> can i assign a default-value in javascript function-parms like in php?
[13:44:04] <rethus> function asdf(param="asdf") ?
[13:44:40] <cirwin> rethus: no
[13:44:53] <cirwin> use options objects and jQuery.extend
[13:45:06] <cirwin> function (opts) { opts = $.extend(defaults, opts); }
[13:46:08] <geekbuntu> abjorn, said unit o.0
[13:46:55] <geekbuntu> abjorn, i imagine that is incredibly useful... prolly can't use normal unit tests in node.js
[14:05:14] <TheoMurpse> I have an <option><span>foo</span></option>. When I do $('option').html() I get 'foo' instead of '<span>foo</span'. Why?
[14:06:31] <shesek> TheoMurpse, <option> elements shouldn't contain HTML in them
[14:07:15] <TheoMurpse> shesek, OK, thanks. I guess I need to add a number of data-foo="" to my OPTION tags then!
[14:07:57] <TheoMurpse> Because I was instead marking the datapoints with <span class="count">number of</span> <span class="unit">units</span>. Oh well.
[14:08:51] <Gambit-> why, when I try to do $('mls_id').append("foo bar"); do I get an undefined_method TypeError?
[14:08:59] <Gambit-> (from the console, that is)
[14:12:11] <smykes24> So turing a string into an operator, im coming up with nothing
[14:17:21] <Dev0n_> hey, is it not possible to have "mouseover mouseout click" event chain when .delegating ?
[14:18:07] <Dev0n_> I want to allow the element to be clicked while a mouseover event over the element
[14:27:39] <abjorn> geekbuntu: yeah, it lets you do unit tests with asynchronous code in node
[14:41:44] <ocf> llo all. i am dynamically building a table with an 'Add/Edit' button in each row. Using Live I am able to click the button & hit my click function. What's the best way to capture the other columns in the row that was clicked? do I use like a this.closet('tr') or something?
[14:42:24] <luchenbill> is there a way to fade images out and in using jquery?
[15:05:00] <juha___> i watched paul yesterday. i was really disappointed when it turned out that it wasn't about paul irish :/

[15:52:02] <quuxman> [\f\r\t\v\u00A0\u2028\u2029] ? What are those unicode characters?
[15:53:10] <quuxman> \u2028 and \u2029 are newlines I guess, so I should remove those too?
[15:57:23] <dabear> quuxman: just do [ \t\v\f]+
[16:03:56] <khaan> hi everybody, is there anyone familiar with the jQuery quicksand plugin? :)
[16:19:16] <pen> hi
[16:40:50] <dtach> Hi im using a live click $("#GoBackDown").live("click", function () {}); the #GoBackDown button is created at some point by another function. My button wont perform whats inside the live click when it is created. But for some reason when i run the function that creates it Again. The button does work. Any ideas?
[16:41:52] <dtach> http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/gH4UC/
[16:59:26] <abjorn> bot-t: Tell paul_irish I proved to him I'm not a hipster: https://github.com/Abjorn/SofaJS or that I proved his point entirely, I'm not really sure
[16:59:27] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[17:03:18] <savid> Hi, I'm using jqueryui datepicker,  and I've included the jqueryui CSS,  but it's not hiding the picker by default.  Any ideas on how to make it hide by default?
[17:09:12] <savid> Also it doesn't seem to be populating the field when I select a date.   Here's my code:  http://dpaste.com/556313/
[17:09:52] <savid> Oh, never mind.  I didn't have the selector for the input itself.

[18:31:38] <asadpakistani> chrome ssl green lock becomes yellow and gives a warning saying some of the elements on the page are not secure as soon as a json object is loaded from an external url and inserted in the dom tree...any ideas?
[18:38:20] <ryanneufeld> load it from the same source
[18:39:59] <miketaylr> asadpakistani: is your external url http or https?
[18:46:54] <blup> is there a way to detect an file being dragged into the browser window?
[18:47:07] <blup> a file*
[18:47:32] <snover> only for browsers that implement html5 drag and drop file api
[18:49:12] <blup> snover: yes, that's already a requirement. how can i detect the event so i can add a class?
[18:49:37] <snover> ?lmgtfy html5 file drag drop @ blup
[18:49:37] <bot-t> blup, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=html5+file+drag+drop
[18:49:39] <Z3R0> Anyone know how to dynamically add new fields and push them into a sql insert? such as, if I wanted to allow multiple phone numbers with say an "Add Number" button to create a new set of fields and when pushed to my php page to insert into sql?
[18:50:02] <Z3R0> Just looking for a reference really, not trying to bother anyone for a working demo
[18:50:25] <asadpakistani> miketaylr: its https...and json doesnt work if u load from a different domain and protocol right so it must be
[18:50:54] <snover> Z3R0: I hope you are not insinuating that you are creating SQL queries *on the client side*
[18:50:55] <miketaylr> asadpakistani: the whole point of jsonp is that it *does* work from a different domain
[18:51:01] <miketaylr> unless you're doing regular XHR
[18:51:12] <Z3R0> I don't think I am?
[18:51:27] <iszak> snover, that's a brilliant idea, going to implement it call it JQL
[18:51:34] <iszak> or jQuerySQL
[18:51:41] <Z3R0> html / jquery = form and validation, jquery then pushes to php to work on the sql right?
[18:52:08] <Z3R0> er ajax or w/e
[18:53:11] <Z3R0>  http://www.unclecode.com/2009/09/jquery-add-new-text-fields-dynamically/ I think this is what I am looking for
[18:53:25] <iszak> should also be doing validation on the server side too Z3R0
[18:53:48] <Z3R0> O.o why validate 2x?
[18:54:02] <miketaylr> to be safe
[18:54:37] <iszak> Z3R0, what miketaylr said, but to elaborate people can bypass the client-side validation (after all it is client side)
[18:55:04] <Z3R0> ok question then, cuz I'm really confused on which side is which ... still learning these fundamentals... I've only really played with html / php before
[18:55:10] <Z3R0> is php considered server side?

[18:59:32] * imsky wiggles digitally
[19:00:07] <imsky> ahh late...night...sunday
[19:00:35] <imsky> MMMMMMMMM
[19:01:33] <abjorn> Brodingo mah nigga
[19:01:45] <abjorn> you goin to the austin nodejs meetup this week?
[19:02:00] <Brodingo> nope
[19:02:03] <abjorn> o
[19:02:04] <abjorn> you should
[19:02:27] <imsky> lol
[19:02:30] <Brodingo> i dont know anything about nodejs
[19:02:31] <imsky> soft sell
[19:02:36] <abjorn> o
[19:02:42] <iszak> Brodingo, it lacks maturity, I'd give it time.
[19:02:47] <abjorn> you should know something about nodejs
[19:02:50] <abjorn> but it's neeaaato
[19:02:57] <imsky> pretty fast
[19:03:02] <iszak> it's not worth your time
[19:03:05] <abjorn> yes it is
[19:03:06] <Brodingo> let me rephrase that, i have no use for nodejs
[19:03:12] <imsky> yeah you do mayne
[19:03:16] <iszak> Brodingo++
[19:03:19] <imsky> set up that...bot...net
[19:03:23] <imsky> in javascript
[19:03:27] <abjorn> I mean, to be fair, I'm only using it for a irc bot right now lol
[19:03:31] <imsky> you see?
[19:03:36] <abjorn> no plans on using it for any production website just yet
[19:03:45] <abjorn> at least, not until it's closer to 1.0
[19:04:41] <imsky> at least use node for npm
[19:04:54] <imsky> it sort of legitimates javascript development
[19:05:00] <abjorn> ...I'm not sure how that's supposed to make sense imsky
[19:05:01] <imsky> legitimizes?
[19:05:07] <abjorn> legitimates!
[19:05:08] <imsky> well ya know
[19:05:10] <abjorn> legit-mates
[19:05:13] <imsky> they got
[19:05:13] <imsky> PEAR
[19:05:16] <imsky> and CPAN
[19:05:17] <imsky> and gems
[19:05:19] <abjorn> we are legit mates
[19:05:20] <imsky> we got npm!
[19:05:27] <imsky> we r legit m8s for lyf
[19:05:34] <abjorn> Yeah, but you don't use Ruby for Gems
[19:05:38] <johnathanb> Slightly off topic, but anyone have any idea why I can't send messages in #vim?
[19:05:40] <imsky> watevs watevs
[19:05:50] <abjorn> not a clue johnathanb
[19:05:50] <imsky> johnathanb: you're in the "receive" mode
[19:05:53] <abjorn> or that
[19:05:54] <johnathanb> This is the only room with people talking that I'm connected to which is why I'm asking here
[19:06:17] <abjorn> idk, playing around in nodejs is fun fun fun
[19:06:32] <johnathanb> imsky: Is there a way to not be in the receive mode? Sorta new to irc
[19:06:34] <abjorn> https://github.com/Abjorn/SofaJS been doing it all day
[19:06:44] <imsky> johnathanb: lolol buddy i'm poking fun at vim
[19:06:49] <johnathanb> oh :(
[19:06:50] <abjorn> rofl
[19:06:51] <imsky> try a random string of characters
[19:06:53] <imsky> that usually works
[19:07:00] <abjorn> press i first
[19:07:06] <imsky> my field guide to vim is: "press q a lot"
[19:07:17] <abjorn> make sure it says "INSERT MODE" at the bottom
[19:07:27] <cirwin> johnathanb: you need to be registered
[19:07:28] <imsky> abjorn: why didn't you call it SofaKingJs
[19:07:31] <cirwin> look in the topic of #vim
[19:07:34] <abjorn> rofl imsky
[19:07:57] <imsky> commonjs is neato
[19:08:04] <abjorn> word
[19:08:06] <imsky> node is but one of the many environments for that though
[19:08:18] <abjorn> the one at the forefront, more or less
[19:08:18] <imsky> expand ur horizonz
[19:08:22] <imsky> well
[19:08:31] <abjorn> i mean, rhino was doing it first but
[19:08:34] <abjorn> come on who uses rhino
[19:08:54] <imsky> umm
[19:08:57] <imsky> a few...people
[19:09:04] <imsky> rhino is pretty useful tho, don't knock it
[19:09:10] <abjorn> yeah I know lol
[19:09:32] <imsky> i dunno somehow
[19:09:37] <imsky> making desktop app with js just feels weird
[19:09:43] <imsky> it's like almost too convenient
[19:09:46] <abjorn> lol
[19:09:58] <abjorn> "You mean...I don't have to worry about segfaults...?"
[19:10:05] <imsky> "this is faster than php?"
[19:10:12] <imsky> "and i've been programming in it my whole life?"
[19:10:14] <imsky> o lord!
[19:10:15] <abjorn> "I don't have to compile...?"
[19:10:23] <abjorn> "Things work on the first try...?"
[19:10:28] <imsky> maaaan!
[19:10:35] <imsky> some bro is porting opengl to v8
[19:10:35] <abjorn> world turned upside down
[19:10:42] <abjorn> yeah
[19:10:46] <imsky> i mean it's already done with tracemonkey
[19:10:47] <abjorn> I don't think that's a good idea
[19:10:49] <imsky> but he's doing it with v8
[19:10:51] <imsky> why not?
[19:10:53] <imsky> php-opengl exists
[19:10:57] <abjorn> A low level library should stay low level
[19:11:02] <imsky> o_O
[19:11:06] <imsky> have u heard of pygame
[19:11:07] <abjorn> Porting a high level library like SFML would be better
[19:11:14] <imsky> sfml is pretty low-level bro
[19:11:22] <abjorn> clearly you've never used opengl
[19:11:24] <abjorn> lololol
[19:11:29] <imsky> man you hating
[19:11:32] <abjorn> sfml is high level for a graphics library
[19:11:40] <imsky> umm
[19:11:47] <imsky> sfml is just another sdl
[19:12:10] <imsky> i think some months ago some bro was in #js and was talking about porting sfml to js
[19:12:20] <abjorn> but no, yeah of course I know of PyGame. I mean if the guy abstracts on top of OpenGL and doesn't make it a 1-to-1 copy of OpenGL in JS like WebGL, then good
[19:12:30] <imsky> but this isn't webgl maaayne
[19:12:47] <imsky> although i do think the guy is making a 1-1 mapping
[19:12:51] <abjorn> But if you're going to port something like OpenGL to a high level language, then you should abstract it, make it simpler. Otherwise you're just wasting your time.
[19:12:51] <imsky> FFI for lyf
[19:13:00] <imsky> that's called...a game engine
[19:13:07] <abjorn> No?
[19:13:09] <imsky> yes
[19:13:19] <abjorn> Rendering engine :3
[19:13:22] <imsky> well
[19:13:28] <imsky> tru dat
[19:13:31] <imsky> i'm just generalizing
[19:13:43] <imsky> rendering engine conjures up raytracers
[19:13:57] <imsky> port pov-ray to v8
[19:14:00] <imsky> aw yeeeahhhh
[19:14:46] <abjorn> But no, I mean, not really. In my personal opinion, WebGL is far more low level than it should be. If you just wrap up every OpenGL function and value as a JavaScript value then you're going to be taking quite a performance hit than if you abstracted the API so that one function did more than one OpenGL C function
[19:14:53] <abjorn> also, fyi, I already ported SFML to V8 ;o
[19:14:54] <imsky> holy crap wallotext
[19:15:19] <imsky> as far as i've read, there's a reason for doing it the stupid, 1-1 way
[19:15:27] <abjorn> http://code.google.com/p/proto-engine/
[19:15:29] <imsky> you can port other stuff on top of the port
[19:15:41] <imsky> oh yea that was the bro's engine!!!
[19:15:41] <abjorn> But I think I'm going to switch over to Node, instead of a stand-alone V8 thing.
[19:15:51] <abjorn> Oh, so I'm the bro?
[19:16:00] <imsky> i have it starred too
[19:16:06] <imsky> wait you're the guy who ported sfml
[19:16:10] <abjorn> roflmao
[19:16:15] <imsky> aw man
[19:16:17] <imsky> legit mates
[19:16:20] <abjorn> I know, right?
[19:16:45] <imsky> good times!
[19:17:06] <abjorn> And yeah, you're right, SFML is just another SDL. It's a C++ OOP SDL basically. Although it does have considerably more features and the advantage of using OpenGL so it's faster.
[19:17:27] <imsky> yeah i went ahead without sfml when i had the choice
[19:17:29] <imsky> processing 4 lyf
[19:17:33] <abjorn> Well, faster assuming OpenGL can use hardware acceleration on the system.
[19:17:33] <imsky> or 4 that semester >_>
[19:17:47] <abjorn> Although I suppose the beta SDL finally has hardware support
[19:17:55] <imsky> yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[19:18:01] <abjorn> But still way less features
[19:18:24] <imsky> man what are you doing at hostgator if you ported sfml
[19:18:26] <imsky> to js
[19:18:37] <imsky> you could be bringing dat heat to mobile game development
[19:18:38] <abjorn> It wasn't exactly difficult lol
[19:18:50] <abjorn> But yeah, I'm basically waiting for NodeJS to mature a bit so I can port ProtoEngine to Node
[19:18:58] <imsky> r u suggesting
[19:19:00] <abjorn> That way the engine has the advantage of npm
[19:19:02] <imsky> an OnLive for v8?
[19:19:08] <abjorn> I...am not.
[19:19:09] <abjorn> lol
[19:19:15] <imsky> hmm ok
[19:19:28] <abjorn> I don't...what? How would that even...?
[19:19:32] <imsky> well
[19:19:37] <imsky> if you port sfml to v8...
[19:19:41] <imsky> and then node
[19:19:45] <imsky> you kinda got...networking
[19:19:49] <imsky> annnd
[19:19:51] <imsky> you know
[19:19:54] <abjorn> Node doesn't HAVE to be used as a server
[19:20:06] <abjorn> I can use it for a desktop application too yakno
[19:20:21] <imsky> well in that case
[19:20:23] <imsky> port gtk to node
[19:20:29] <abjorn> someone is already doing that
[19:20:37] <imsky> things move fast round these parts
[19:20:49] <abjorn> lol I saw a project for that like
[19:20:52] <abjorn> months ago
[19:21:00] <abjorn> but it's not in npm and it seems to be moving rather slow
[19:21:15] <imsky> hay, opportunity
[19:21:22] <imsky> you could obviate vala in a few months
[19:21:25] <abjorn> Either way, GUI libraries aren't my thing
[19:21:32] <abjorn> I'm not very good with them
[19:21:39] <imsky> well to hell with that then
[19:21:44] <imsky> just make a gui library in sfml!
[19:21:49] <abjorn> lol maybe so
[19:21:57] <imsky> yea man!!
[19:22:07] <abjorn> well, there's already several for SFML, but they kinda suck.
[19:22:14] <imsky> so stoked about this gui library in sfml running in node.js on v8 on unix, which i'm not running
[19:22:20] <imsky> woooooo
[19:22:25] <abjorn> https://github.com/Tim-Smart/node-gtk no commit since march :(
[19:22:46] <imsky> oh yeah speaking of
[19:22:50] <imsky> you tried gnome3 yet?
[19:22:52] <gopus> I have two functions in succession of one another. The first changes the text in a particular DIV. And then the second function reads the text just changed. The second function, however, doesn't appear to wait for the first function to process because I get the original value. How would I remedy this?
[19:22:53] <abjorn> Yeah I'm also waiting for Windows support in Node before continuing ProtoEngine...
[19:22:57] <abjorn> not yet
[19:23:05] <imsky> i tried it, it's pretty good, but was choppy
[19:23:14] <abjorn> gopus: show us your code
[19:23:22] <imsky> someone sucks at cpu scheduling at gnome project
[19:23:40] <abjorn> imsky: But Windows support is what they're working on for Node right now. They're working on 0.5 which should have Windows support
[19:23:42] <abjorn> lol
[19:23:45] <imsky> woooo
[19:23:52] <imsky> technically if they can port it to msys...
[19:23:55] <imsky> that's like..job done
[19:24:03] <abjorn> Yeah but it doesn't work very well.
[19:24:11] <imsky> poorly written garbage!
[19:24:43] <abjorn> Working on their own async io/event library for it as well. Since Windows has it's own utilities for that in the kernel space, unlike unix
[19:24:48] <imsky> gopus, u need a callback m8
[19:24:54] <abjorn> yeah probably
[19:25:06] <imsky> kernel space
[19:25:14] <imsky> i just visualize popcorn in orbit
[19:25:17] <abjorn> rofl
[19:25:30] <abjorn> as in it's programmed into the low level os brah
[19:25:36] <imsky> ya man ya
[19:25:41] <abjorn> also space popcorn
[19:25:44] <imsky> yes
[19:25:47] <imsky> more important
[19:25:49] <abjorn> very
[19:25:57] <abjorn> man
[19:26:01] <abjorn> the break room at hostgator
[19:26:02] <abjorn> so awesome
[19:26:08] <imsky> man don't be bragging
[19:26:17] <abjorn> gaming computers with over 160 gb of video games, kid
[19:26:19] <abjorn> hard to beat that
[19:26:22] <imsky> daaaaaaaamn
[19:26:29] <abjorn> also free lunch every day
[19:26:36] <imsky> double daaaaaaaaaaaamn
[19:26:39] <ryanseddon> how about a slide going from 1 level to a games room
[19:26:46] <abjorn> see now there's an idea
[19:26:48] <imsky> a fireman's pole?
[19:26:51] <abjorn> brb emailing HR
[19:26:52] <imsky> fire..station..pole?
[19:26:57] <imsky> north...station...pole?
[19:27:12] <abjorn> also lots of arcade machines, pool tables, etc in the break room
[19:27:12] <ryanseddon> My new job has a slide to the games room from level4 to 3
[19:27:14] <gopus> abjorn: I mean it is pretty basic. I just don't know how to solve it. It's probably really simple: http://jsfiddle.net/kw2L5/
[19:27:22] <gopus> imsky: callback...
[19:27:22] <imsky> damn!
[19:27:24] <abjorn> you're kidding me, ryanseddon
[19:27:27] <gopus> imsky: I'll look that up.
[19:27:27] <imsky> hope they're making tons o money
[19:27:32] <ryanseddon> I do not kid
[19:27:38] <imsky> pics or shens
[19:27:43] <abjorn> Hm, gopus, that's odd.
[19:27:46] <abjorn> It should work
[19:28:02] <abjorn> Where do you work, ryanseddon?
[19:28:04] <imsky> lol there's no source
[19:28:13] <imsky> also $("buildingdropdown div")
[19:28:14] <ryanseddon> I havn't started there yet but I used it in my interview
[19:28:14] <abjorn> oh
[19:28:16] <imsky> this is not a selector
[19:28:23] <abjorn> lol
[19:28:25] <abjorn> no wonder
[19:28:25] <abjorn> I AM BLIND
[19:28:26] <imsky> unless it's...xhtml
[19:28:27] <imsky> o_O
[19:28:31] <abjorn> imsky has cured me of my hubris
[19:28:33] <asadpakistani> $.getJSON makes the browser ssl lock go away, even tho i am loading from a ssl url????
[19:28:48] <gopus> imsky: heh it has a #
[19:28:48] <imsky> i am a pausterizing force
[19:28:55] <gopus> imsky: I just didn't want to write the entire trigger.
[19:28:55] <imsky> gopus: not in the first one
[19:29:03] <gopus> imsky: right.
[19:29:10] <abjorn> You should change your name to Louis Pasteur
[19:29:10] <ryanseddon> abjorn: it's an aussie job search called seek
[19:29:15] <gopus> imsky: a cut and paste error.
[19:29:16] <abjorn> ah
[19:29:19] <abjorn> well damn man
[19:29:21] <abjorn> that's badass
[19:29:24] <imsky> also .text() doesn't set anything, gopus
[19:29:34] <gopus> imsky: yes, I know...
[19:29:37] <gopus> imsky: again...
[19:29:37] <imsky> so...
[19:29:40] <imsky> paste some...code
[19:29:45] <gopus> BAH FINE
[19:29:46] <abjorn> maybe you want .html()
[19:29:46] <imsky> or sumthin
[19:29:49] <gopus> :-P
[19:29:53] <imsky> yes i think he wants api.jquery.com
[19:29:58] <abjorn> ?html
[19:29:59] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/

[19:32:43] <imsky> whatever they call themselves
[19:32:45] <macheleon> oh derp
[19:32:49] <abjorn> #jquery-ui
[19:32:53] <imsky> jquery ui is a big pile of kim jong il
[19:33:01] <abjorn> so stuck in the 80s?
[19:33:07] <imsky> that too
[19:33:08] <macheleon> been in here so long I forgot there was the separate channel
[19:33:18] <macheleon> can you join it only from north korea?
[19:33:24] <imsky> not only that
[19:33:32] <imsky> but only north koreans think it's cool
[19:33:39] <imsky> to everyone else it's a repressive tyrant
[19:33:49] <macheleon> self-propagating
[19:33:58] <macheleon> or something.
[19:34:04] <imsky> yes, plz 2 go nao
[19:34:17] <imsky> also you should ask your q on stackoverflow
[19:34:25] <imsky> every day i try to be first to answer some jquery question
[19:34:27] <imsky> always i'm beat
[19:34:31] <macheleon> ok I'm going to go dare ask such a question there :)
[19:34:34] <imsky> by some bro that just has like quad monitors
[19:34:41] <gopus> imsky: http://jsfiddle.net/kw2L5/1/
[19:34:43] <imsky> with api.jquery.com in F11
[19:34:46] <macheleon> I'm a stackoverflow leech, I admit it :(
[19:34:46] <imsky> on one f them
[19:35:00] <gopus> imsky: I would guess that your suggestion of a callback is what the problem is
[19:35:26] <gopus> imsky: I didn't realize that .POST loads would be run while the other code continues, which I assume is what is going on
[19:35:42] <imsky> gopus, your source still makes no sense. there's no buildingdropdown in the html..
[19:35:48] <imsky> and the building var isn't even used anywhere
[19:35:51] <imsky> wut is this
[19:36:13] <imsky> i declare shenanigans on this fiddle
[19:36:27] <gopus> imsky: http://jsfiddle.net/kw2L5/2/
[19:36:28] <gopus> there.
[19:36:34] <gopus> #buildingdropdown is there
[19:36:38] <gopus> I mean there is a lot I could post.
[19:36:43] <gopus> trying to post relevant, I'm sorry
[19:36:44] <gopus> :-/
[19:37:41] <imsky> gopus: http://jsfiddle.net/kw2L5/3/
[19:37:52] <imsky> plz 2 explane why no work?
[19:38:01] <imsky> also space popcorn
[19:39:16] <imsky> abjorn: what are your interests in tech?
[19:39:25] <abjorn> that's
[19:39:29] <abjorn> a very vague question
[19:39:30] <abjorn> lol
[19:39:32] <imsky> well
[19:39:43] <abjorn> my interests are i like it
[19:39:53] <imsky> that's not an interest
[19:39:54] <gopus> imsky: I'm not sure what you did.
[19:39:58] <imsky> that's like a sentence
[19:40:05] <imsky> do u liek graphix?
[19:40:13] <imsky> or low-level stuff
[19:40:22] <imsky> trying to get a feel for a collab there, bro
[19:40:45] <imsky> gopus, i'm not sure what the problem is
[19:40:54] <abjorn> Uhm, a lot of stuff I guess. I like graphics stuff, yeah, not so much the low level stuff. I like systems programming
[19:41:03] <abjorn> And just about anything javascript
[19:41:12] <abjorn> idk i dont quite get your question still lol
[19:41:18] <imsky> hmm
[19:41:31] <imsky> ok what do you like...
[19:41:33] <imsky> read aboot
[19:41:36] <gopus> imsky: when it alerts the building variable, it alerts the content of the <div> PRECEDING the trigger, despite the fact that the trigger precedes the alert.
[19:41:38] <imsky> in terms of programming
[19:41:52] <imsky> gopus, so put the alert in the callback
[19:42:05] <abjorn> Uhm, well just about anything JavaScript related.
[19:42:21] <imsky> alright bud lol
[19:42:23] <gopus> *blinks*
[19:42:25] <gopus> oh that's smart.
[19:42:30] <abjorn> And functional programming related stuff
[19:42:34] <imsky> ooh
[19:42:39] <imsky> you like schemekipz?
[19:42:44] <abjorn> also game programming
[19:42:47] <abjorn> yeah I like scheme
[19:42:50] <imsky> yeeeeee
[19:42:55] <imsky> oh
[19:42:58] <abjorn> and python
[19:42:59] <imsky> have you used emscripten yet?
[19:43:04] <abjorn> not really
[19:43:07] <imsky> maaaaan'
[19:43:12] <imsky> that's calling out to you bro
[19:43:13] <abjorn> I don't have a whole lot of interest in it to be honest
[19:43:16] <imsky> oh
[19:43:16] <abjorn> I know it is but idk lol
[19:43:32] <imsky> yeah i'm just waiting to use it on something nice
[19:43:35] <abjorn> Like, it doesn't interest me because I already like JavaScript better, so
[19:43:51] <imsky> ...right but
[19:43:57] <imsky> you can...create sweet code
[19:44:00] <imsky> from..any code
[19:44:00] <abjorn> lol
[19:44:01] <abjorn> brb
[19:44:13] <imsky> gopus, is your problem solved yet
[19:44:27] <gopus> imsky: I'm not sure what a callback is, so I'm looking that up.
[19:44:36] <imsky> it's...oh jesus
[19:44:45] <imsky> this part: function(data) {
[19:44:48] <imsky> that's your success function
[19:44:49] <imsky> aka callback
[19:44:57] <imsky> you put the alert after the replaceWith stuff
[19:45:56] <gopus> imsky: oh great.
[19:46:13] <imsky> yeah, jquery relies pretty heavily on callbacks
[19:46:15] <gopus> imsky: yeah I just didn't realize that triggers would work separate from things because I am very dumb.
[19:46:18] <gopus> it works though
[19:46:22] <imsky> a good deal of the everyday functions use them
[19:46:31] <imsky> yeah jquery is not...intuitive
[19:46:36] <imsky> but you get it eventually
[19:46:39] <gopus> yeah I used callbacks I was just unsure of the nomenclature
[19:48:33] <geestring> has anyone here used the Jquery color plugin before? I'm animating the opacity of borders using rgba and it's really slow when making it fully opaque. But with making it transparent it is fine
[19:48:34] <abjorn> *javascript relies pretty heavily on callbacks
[19:48:35] <abjorn> fixed that for ya imsky
[19:48:51] <imsky> hmm
[19:48:56] <imsky> that's a very blanket statement
[19:49:09] <imsky> also i just realized i have a github account
[19:49:12] <abjorn> well, javascript in the browser
[19:49:13] <abjorn> lol imsky
[19:49:14] <imsky> so you just got yourself +1 follower
[19:49:19] <abjorn> awww yeeaah
[19:49:36] <imsky> now if only i could bridge fossil and git
[19:49:44] <imsky> with my considerable dvcs skills
[19:50:01] <abjorn> lol
[19:51:42] <imsky> i love fossil addremove
[19:51:45] <imsky> it's like
[19:51:49] <imsky> the king of everything
[19:52:58] <abjorn> I don't even know what that is.
[19:53:27] <imsky> it's a better git add -i
[19:53:55] <imsky> or actually
[19:53:58] <imsky> git add -A
[19:54:05] <imsky> -i is for paranoia
[19:54:15] <abjorn> lol
[19:54:51] <imsky> github kinda sucks for browing repos
[19:55:01] <imsky> can't find the cool, new stuff
[19:56:14] <imsky> there are some pretty badass new things coming out though
[19:56:19] <imsky> pdf.js, that mp3 decoder
[19:56:31] <abjorn> ah yeah i saw that
[19:57:22] <imsky> you hear how zed crashed github?
[19:58:40] <macheleon> yum, fixed that ui dialog overlay thing and didn't even have to speak to kim jong il
[19:59:00] <imsky> you dodged a bullet my friend
[20:03:43] <imsky> abjorn, you're internet famous: http://i.imgur.com/rljXv.jpg
[20:05:38] <qq99> Sorry I'm not quite sure where to ask this, but does anyone know of a good utility (maybe a firebug plugin?) to save the content of HTTP post responses?  Firebug has a save header functionality, but that's not what I need.  Use case is saving raw data returned by non-text MIME types.  I don't wanna have to capture via wireshark and hex edit it :s
[20:05:45] <qq99> any more than I have to, at least
[20:06:21] <abjorn> omg im internet famous imsky
[20:06:27] <imsky> omg omg
[20:06:32] <snover> qq99: right click. “copy response body”.
[20:07:16] <qq99> snover, doesn't seem to have that option for Content-Type	audio/mpeg
[20:07:53] <imsky> lol
[20:08:45] <imsky> are you trying to rip some mp3s through firebug?
[20:08:54] <abjorn> a pirates tool of choice
[20:09:24] <imsky> on a different note: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMmdl4VltD4
[20:09:27] <qq99> lol :) was hoping to find a faster way than using wireshark to capture the stream and edit out the HTTP headers with a hex editor
[20:10:09] <miketaylr> qq99: are you on a mac?
[20:10:10] <imsky> 0_o
[20:10:18] <qq99> miketaylr, nope
[20:10:20] <miketaylr> ?g HTTP Client mac download

[20:10:21] <miketaylr> oh
[20:10:34] <qq99> miketaylr, ubuntu
[20:10:46] <iszak> urlsnarf ?
[20:11:09] <iszak> oh right, you need headers and such, don't think urlsnarf does that
[20:11:22] <iszak> although urlsnarf is great for finding the direct link to CDN hosted files.
[20:11:31] <imsky> wat a helpful man
[20:12:31] <iszak> more helpful than you
[20:12:35] <snover> on ubuntu, doesn’t know about the command-line tool POST
[20:12:41] <snover> so sad, kids these days
[20:12:59] <imsky> lol inorite
[20:13:06] <imsky> not like curl exists or anything
[20:13:26] <abjorn> I curl it up each and erry day
[20:13:41] <abjorn> with all the fine ladies
[20:13:42] <qq99> I'll give that a shot
[20:13:55] <abjorn> curl URLHERE -v
[20:14:12] <snover> Part of the lwp-request package is a tool whose command name is literally POST
[20:14:21] <snover> and I think that it comes installed by default on ubuntu
[20:14:30] <qq99> it does :)
[20:14:35] <abjorn> yeah
[20:14:47] <abjorn> why they chose to make it all caps is beyond me, though
[20:15:05] <imsky> why they chose to make it all caps on a case-sensitive platform
[20:15:07] <imsky> is not
[20:15:32] <iszak> cool story bro

[20:16:12] <imsky> well.
[20:16:34] <iszak> >
[20:16:42] <iszak> well..? what?
[20:22:32] <macheleon> I'm adding a div with a semitransparent background using var tempDiv = $("<div id='tempOverlayDiv' class='ui-widget-overlay'></div>"); and .append(), and removing it with .remove(). If I do this repeatedly it keeps getting more and more opaque
[20:22:41] <macheleon> what am I missing here?
[20:23:52] <shesek> macheleon, can you pastebin your code?
[20:23:59] <shesek> Preferably on jsfiddle
[20:25:11] <macheleon> ugh getting called away, sorry I shall pastebin and repost on return
[20:31:02] <Ontolog> Hey
[20:33:03] <abjorn> hallo
[20:35:13] <macheleon> hallo
[20:35:59] <macheleon> hm, I need to worry about that overlay later,
[20:37:36] <macheleon> $('#open-dialog-01').click(function() { event.preventDefault(); }); is this the right way to stop default link behaviour? doesn't work in IE
[20:38:26] <macheleon> wait, there's no event
[20:40:12] <shesek> macheleon, you should be getting it as an argument to your anonymous function
[20:40:50] <macheleon> I changed it to $('#open-dialog-01').click(function(event) {
[20:41:00] <macheleon> nfi if that's dumb thing to do
[20:41:18] <coldhead> no that's right
[20:41:45] <coldhead> that way you assign a name to it
[20:41:49] <macheleon> thanks. I can make stuff work, but I'm slowly learning the concepts behind things
[20:41:52] <macheleon> *usually
[20:41:52] <coldhead> for your use
[20:42:08] <macheleon> ah yes that makes sense
[20:48:54] <abjorn> coldhead <3
[20:51:51] <coldhead> can someone get me cake
[20:51:58] <macheleon> sure, I'm going out
[20:52:03] <coldhead> thx
[20:52:11] <macheleon> what variety would you like today
[20:52:12] <coldhead> it's for my diabetes
[20:52:23] <coldhead> whatever you can manage
[20:52:26] <macheleon> righto
[20:53:57] <Z3R0> question, I'm trying to update a DAY field based on the MONTH selected in the previous combobox... using the .change() $.post('php/getComboDate.php',{type : 1, month : $('#dob_month').val }, function(data) { // but $_POST['month'] is not returning a value of anything
[20:54:13] <abjorn> cake: the perfect cure for diabetes
[20:54:58] <ThrushAAX> you mean .val() right?
[20:55:20] <Z3R0> yes... yes I do... crap
[20:55:21] <iszak> coldhead, you on nightly yet?
[20:55:24] <Z3R0> stupid mistake
[20:55:35] <Z3R0> even said that in the tutorial I was reading... just didn't catch it
[20:55:46] <coldhead> still on stolen wifi, iszak
[20:55:47] <coldhead> so no
[20:55:50] <coldhead> D:
[20:56:06] <Z3R0> was wondering why my alert() was filled with a bunch of crap
[20:56:22] <ThrushAAX> hehe
[20:56:23] <iszak> coldhead, :( I want to show you something.
[20:56:29] <Z3R0> there we go...
[20:56:56] <coldhead> iszak: i'm trying to make tony abbott fix it
[20:56:58] <ThrushAAX> if you have something like firebug you should also be able to see the exact POST content that is sent
[20:57:02] <coldhead> this is his electorate
[20:57:06] <Z3R0> now it correctly populates based on month... although I just realized something even worse... that technically it should also base on year, due to it being a birthdate you need the year first
[20:57:16] <iszak> coldhead, can't, they went with gillards NBN
[20:57:30] <Z3R0> I have chrome's devtools didn't think about that
[20:57:40] <coldhead> yes, i think that might be part of the problem
[20:57:52] <coldhead> "this wouldn't happen if we were using 3g"
[20:58:59] <Z3R0> there all fixed... lol
[20:59:36] <Z3R0> thanks ThrushAAX
[21:04:07] <iszak> so who's running nightlies?
[21:05:25] <timwis> Evening all
[21:06:11] <timwis> I am trying to determine where a user clicks on the image by dividing the image into a grid (i.e. user clicked on square B-2). Any suggestions to where I might start looking?
[21:06:26] <iszak> coldhead, :( please download chromium nightly
[21:06:40] <iszak> I need a m
[21:06:55] <iszak> s/m/guinea pig/

[21:12:47] <iszak> pleaseee?
[21:13:01] <imsky> is it that hot new command i keep hearing about
[21:13:03] <imsky> alt+f4?
[21:13:05] <iszak> yes
[21:13:07] <iszak> and no
[21:15:21] <iszak> imsky, all I need you to do is view a page in chromium nightly

[21:16:03] <iszak> with sexual favours?
[21:16:07] <imsky> USD
[21:16:15] <iszak> nah, usd is too weak
[21:16:17] <coldhead> you can remain in #jQuery if you do it
[21:16:50] <iszak> it's a bait and switch basically
[21:17:08] <abjorn> whelp, time for sleep
[21:17:11] <abjorn> gotta get up bright and early

[21:26:25] <Cydd> omg guys..........search "gay" on Google - look to the right :O
[21:27:54] <matter> Hi guys !
[21:29:09] <matter> I have a problem with jquery FadeIn/Out..actually it is working fine but we find the transition between images are jurky..do you know any solution to make them smoother ? thanks
[21:31:01] <imsky> which version of jquery are you using
[21:31:14] <Ontolog> I want to make a "click-to-edit" field. Right now the text is in an <li> and these li's are sortable. However I want a non-dragging click to make the li content editable.
[21:31:15] <Ontolog> Any idea?
[21:31:48] <bobbobbins> hey, im using $.ajax to return some data, but my client wants to be able to specify how the data is returned, etiher json, xml or raw data...is it best to just do that on the server side, or pull the data over and translate it in jquery?
[21:33:25] <matter> jquery 1.5.0
[21:33:36] <imsky> matter, try 1.6.1
[21:34:05] <matter> thanks imsky, i am going to try this now
[21:37:56] <matter> imsky, my animation stopped working with 1.6.1
[21:38:01] <imsky> lol
[21:38:21] <imsky> what's your animation code?
[21:40:14] <matter> I found that queryLoader.js ( plugin to load the animation ) cause the problem
[21:40:46] <imsky> all right
[21:41:32] <dr0id> imsky: yo
[21:41:35] <matter> hum..the transitions between the images are still jurky ( it is a fullscreen background slideshow )
[21:41:53] <imsky> hey dr0id
[21:42:53] <imsky> matter: that's unfortunate. what sort of elements are animated? divs, ps?
[21:43:30] <matter> img
[21:43:49] <matter> there are inside a div
[21:44:16] <imsky> hmm
[21:44:20] <imsky> what kind of animation is it?
[21:44:27] <imsky> slide, fade?
[21:44:33] <matter> fade
[21:45:32] <imsky> hmmm
[21:46:33] <imsky> where are those helpful comments by iszak now i wonder
[21:47:18] <imsky> matter, do you pre-load the images or load them right before animating?
[21:48:01] <matter> the plugin load them before animating
[21:48:02] <iszak> what are you on about?
[21:49:06] <imsky> matter: eh without seeing the code, i can't help much...have you tried it in other browsers?
[21:49:59] <matter> I have tried on Firefox, Safari, Chrome , IE, The best is Firefox then Chrome, then Safari , then IE
[21:50:17] <matter> I am going to put the code on jsfiddle
[21:50:21] <alex87> any suggestions on making a phone number alternate between text and letters?
[21:58:54] <matter> imsky, doesn't seems to work on jsfiddle, but here is the link : http://jsfiddle.net/p6etw/
[22:01:34] <imsky> matter: that is a pretty big image. have you tried the animation with smaller images?
[22:04:13] <matter> imsky, do you think 800 px width will be enough without losing quality
[22:05:44] <imsky> well that depends on compression...
[22:06:02] <imsky> i'm just wondering at what point the animations start to degrade
[22:07:55] <matter> i think the problem is the size of the image, if I play the animation and my browser size is not fullscreen , the animation is smoother
[22:11:00] <bobbobbins> hey, how can i get my var, settings, to pass to my getData method? http://jsfiddle.net/supza/
[22:18:23] <bobbobbins> any help?
[22:21:09] <Cork> bobbobbins: you need to use a callback function
[22:21:39] <Cork> bobbobbins: ajax is async so the function has completed BEFORE the ajax call is complete
[22:22:51] <bobbobbins> ok, but thats not my question
[22:23:09] <Cork> bobbobbins: the answer is "you can't"
[22:23:09] <cirwin> bobbobbins: $.fn.spdi.methods[method](settings)
[22:23:11] <bobbobbins> im having trouble with the settings variable
[22:23:34] <Cork> ugg backwards >_<'
[22:23:35] <Cork> sorry
[22:24:48] <bobbobbins> i can't use settings in my method?
[22:24:50] <Cork> bobbobbins: sorry your answer would be getData: function(settings) and $.fn.spdi.methods[method].apply(that, arguments, options);
[22:25:08] <Cork> uh no not even that
[22:25:14] <Cork> you need to merge arguments and options
[22:25:35] <bobbobbins> oh ok
[22:25:51] <Cork> function(settings) and $.fn.spdi.methods[method].apply(that, $.extend(true, {}, options, arguments);
[22:25:52] <Cork> there
[22:25:56] <Cork> + )
[22:26:39] <Cork> (too early in the morning, the brain isn't completly started yet :D )
[22:27:21] <bobbobbins> hmm, that doesn't seem to work either :(
[22:27:29] <bobbobbins> man, passing things is a pain
[22:28:38] <Cork> bobbobbins: this doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/supza/1/
[22:29:05] <Cork> sorry read the code backwards http://jsfiddle.net/supza/2/
[22:29:07] <cirwin> what are you mucking around with arguments for?
[22:29:47] <Cork> cirwin: all passed options to the function
[22:30:00] <cirwin> options is a single argument?
[22:30:06] <cirwin> or do you actually want varargs too?
[22:30:12] <Cork> no all functions has a variable arguments
[22:30:26] <bobbobbins> im not very good with jquery, and im trying to set up a set of methods that take a few arguments and return ajax...so this is what i came up with, is there a better way?
[22:30:36] <Cork> it will hold all the options passed to the function, even if you haven't assigned a variable for them
[22:31:11] <bobbobbins> still says settings undefined
[22:31:23] <cirwin> bobbobbins: don't use apply
[22:31:34] <cirwin> just call the function with the settings argument
[22:31:41] <cirwin> $.fn.spdi.methods[method](settings)
[22:31:41] <Cork> ya, i just thought about that
[22:32:23] <bobbobbins> haha, yeah, that works
[22:32:46] <Cork> call would have worked though :)
[22:32:58] <Cork> evne if it would be pointless
[22:33:31] <bobbobbins> so is there a way to do some sort of init call...that sets the vars in the main function...then when you call the other functions, it doesn't need anything passed to it?
[22:34:01] <bobbobbins> (i have no idea what im doing, im confusing myself)
[22:38:04] <cirwin> bobbobbins: sort-of
[22:38:13] <cirwin> though it's hard to do it safely if you are doing ajax in the middle
[22:38:36] <bobbobbins> ok, i'll just keep it this way for now
[22:38:37] <cirwin> you can just create a new closure every time your function is called
[22:51:12] <Mixmasterxp> is there a way to load multiple scripts with getScript?
[22:51:37] <Mixmasterxp> and also, is there a way to get the progress of loading scripts?
[22:51:55] <ryanneufeld> look at yepnope and lab.js
[22:52:02] <Z3R0> using $.post my response from the server is <img src='path/file.jpg'></img> (Found by using alert('Response: ' + data.image); ) However, this  $('#employee_picture').html(data.image); fails with only outputting <img src>
[22:53:25] <Z3R0> should I just response with the image name, and place the path with .htm() ?
[22:54:49] <Z3R0> hmm odd, but that seemed to work, any ideas why the above failed?
[22:57:35] <Z3R0> worked once... failed the second time... wtF?
[22:59:57] <Z3R0> guess everyone is now asleep
[23:00:04] <gf3> N OU
[23:00:06] <gf3> er
[23:00:08] <gf3> NO U
[23:00:57] <coldhead> NOUN
[23:01:07] <dr0id> NOUNS
[23:02:07] <coldhead> i would expect that to work, Z3R0
[23:02:14] <coldhead> but alert() is not a great tool
[23:02:20] <coldhead> try console.log(data)
[23:02:25] <Z3R0> well I also realized I think I needed a callback
[23:02:28] <coldhead> and console.log(data.img)
[23:02:37] <Z3R0> because I'm trying to change content that is loaded prior to it...
[23:02:44] <coldhead> ah i see
[23:02:51] <Z3R0> loadPage('view_employee') Do stuff on that page
[23:03:01] <Z3R0> so I would assume I place that all into...
[23:03:12] <Z3R0> loadPage('view_employee', function() { }); ?
[23:03:13] <Mixmasterxp> ryanneufeld: does yepnope support caching?
[23:03:34] <coldhead> if that's how loadPage works, yes
[23:03:42] <Z3R0> well, that's what I'm trying to figure out...
[23:03:46] <ryanneufeld> ?yepnope @ Mixmasterxp
[23:03:47] <bot-t1> Mixmasterxp, yepnope is an asynchronous conditional resource loader that's super-fast, and allows you to load only the scripts that your users need: http://yepnopejs.com/
[23:03:53] <coldhead> i think this might be too advanced for me
[23:04:00] <Z3R0> obviously I need it to be loadded before I can mess with it right?
[23:04:02] <ryanneufeld> ?lab @ Mixmasterxp
[23:04:03] <bot-t1> Mixmasterxp, Open Lab | jQuery Plugins - This is a powerful component to build easily a multilevel tree menu or a contextual menu (right click) in an intuitive way! http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/open-lab
[23:04:04] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[23:04:19] <coldhead> yes, Z3R0, gotta wait for it to be on the page :)
[23:04:49] <Z3R0> yea, so that's what that should do...
[23:05:09] <Z3R0> the callback should wait until completed before doing the next action... of course, once I added that... all my alerts stopped...
[23:10:05] <coldhead> ?p @ Z3R0
[23:10:05] <bot-t1> Z3R0, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[23:19:59] <Z3R0> wtf???
[23:20:06] <Z3R0> how come it works now? and I didn't change anything?
[23:20:46] <danheberden> ?twss
[23:20:46] <bot-t1> <iainvdw> was fiddling with it for a while, got close a few times, but didn't do exaclty what i wanted, thx!
[23:20:51] <Z3R0> and now it randomly fails again
[23:21:42] <danheberden> Z3R0 i have no idea what your problem is, but most often that screams someone attaching events or working on dom-nodes that may or may not be present yet.
[23:21:55] <danheberden> e.g. sometimes the browser has them available in time, sometimes not
[23:23:58] <Mixmasterxp> is yepnope.js inluded with modernizr?
[23:24:45] <Z3R0> If Anyone Can Help: http://jsfiddle.net/sxhjP/1/ // The CSS Field includes the PHP File since I could not add it there
[23:25:39] <Z3R0> basically it works, if I click the link, refresh the page, then click the link again, but it will not work on first try
[23:26:20] <Z3R0> I'm assuming I need some sort of callback or something indicating that the loadPage() has finished... but i don't really know how to do that without a little guidance
[23:30:48] <Z3R0> woot, ok fixed by changing from my loadPage() to using .load() and it's built-in callfunction, would rather like to use my own setup, but this works and I'm happy lol
[23:31:04] <Z3R0> time to call it a night, laters
[23:39:10] <macheleon> hey coldhead
