[00:19:59] <mix> some1 help me
[00:23:31] <faraway> mix: ? not sure what you question is
[00:24:27] <mix> mhm

[00:25:50] <mix> .after(Element) etc
[00:26:04] <faraway> mix: what do you mean with effect ... :D .. you try to insert but it does not work ?
[00:26:10] <mix> nono
[00:26:16] <faraway> mix: or do you want an animation ?
[00:26:36] <mix> it is inserted
[00:27:16] <mix> but my css can't work on this inserted element
[00:27:55] <Cork> mix: its better to show the code
[00:27:57] <Cork> ?p
[00:27:57] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:28:11] <Cork> the resulting html structure is really important
[00:29:37] <VectorX> with .ajax how do i use url to tell it to post to the same page ? without giving a url ?
[00:30:33] <Cronoh> how to use url while not giving a url?
[00:30:39] <Cronoh> that is the question
[00:30:42] <Cronoh> lol :P
[00:31:39] <VectorX> i want the ajax request to go to the existing page
[00:32:28] <mix> i want upload image using xhr2
[00:32:51] <mix> but i'cant handle image on server side
[00:32:58] <mix> any1 know it?
[00:33:05] <VectorX> ie if the calling page is server.com/something/?page=script  i want it to post back to server.com/something/?page=script
[00:33:29] <VectorX> and server.com/something/ is unknown
[00:33:30] <beachandbytes> give it an empty url
[00:36:05] <mix> i want upload image using xhr2 but i'cant handle image on server side
[00:38:59] <VectorX> beachandbytes that looks good

[01:00:01] <agi_> hi guys, is there a php channel?
[01:00:17] <boulet101010_> ##php
[01:00:18] <Phil-Work> ##php
[01:00:29] <boulet101010_> you must be nickserv identified
[01:00:30] <agi_> thank you
[01:01:09] <hye> hey
[01:01:11] <hye> hi
[01:01:13] <hye> I have a checkbox
[01:01:30] <hye> and as soon as that checkbox is clicked. alot of javascript runs that takes up to 5 seconds to process in some cases
[01:01:45] <hye> so when the user clicks the checkbox... it might take five seconds for the checkbox to get checked, while it finishes its work
[01:01:56] <hye> how can i check it before it starts the work?  so the user sees that its more responsive?
[01:05:00] <hye> oh i can use set timeout ;)
[01:05:01] <hye> let me try
[01:05:42] <reloadz> boulet101010_: hi
[01:06:48] <agi_> hye: use loader
[01:07:15] <hye> what does a loader do?
[01:07:32] <hye> agi_ http://api.jquery.com/load/ thats what your referring to?
[01:07:42] <agi_> like background work
[01:08:40] <Myx0x3> gosh.. how do i create an "loading" div, that removes before it sends to the location? now i get an loading div, but if i press back in the browser it shows forever..
[01:08:49] <Myx0x3> i think it caches or something
[01:08:52] <hye> agi_ do you know where i can read on up on that?
[01:08:54] <agi_> hye: user sees a loading image until the jquery work finished
[01:09:08] <hye> oh i dont want that
[01:10:10] <agi_> why that takes 5 seconds?
[01:10:10] <hye> i got it to work:  setTimeout(Initialize, 0);
[01:10:18] <hye> so it checks the checkbox... and then does the work
[01:10:25] <hye> it does have dom traversing
[01:10:29] <hye> heavy
[01:11:54] <agi_> i think this loader is easy
[01:13:22] <hye> load delays the UI
[01:13:26] <hye> the user has to wait for it to load
[01:13:32] <hye> using the setTimeout
[01:13:34] <hye> the user doesnt wait
[01:13:40] <hye> just keeps doing stuff, while it does work in the background ;)
[01:15:30] <agi_> ok, u can use setTimeout :)
[01:20:20] <hye> where are you from agi_
[01:24:30] <agi_> mongolia
[01:24:35] <nobitanobi> I am trying to understand what something like this would do $('#id #id2') - if an element just have one ID
[01:25:14] <seutje> nobitanobi: it'll find #id2 and then check if it has a parent #id1
[01:25:24] <seutje> I think
[01:25:31] <ravenzz> ..
[01:26:01] <ravenzz> nobitanobi it will select the element with #id2 which is descendant of #id

[01:31:41] <MiracleBlue> I see.
[01:33:50] <colton> hi! i got a question regarding effects on a select element. if the user hasnt selected anything and wants to proceed, i highlight the select box with jqueryui .effect(...) function. if the select box gets focused, i want the effect to stop, so i added a handler for selectbox.focusin() which calls the .stop(true, true) function. i did the exact same thing for a text form, for this one it is working fine, but for the select element it isnt and the effect doesnt stop
[01:33:50] <colton> . anybody an idea about this behaviour?
[01:36:34] <Myx0x3> why does this not work? http://jsfiddle.net/NW4F3/
[01:38:48] <Myx0x3> whops, found an error.. http://jsfiddle.net/NW4F3/1/
[01:39:57] <Klevre> Hi, I'm trying to dynamically resize an image to fit the container it's in
[01:40:05] <Klevre> currently image size is smaller both container height and width
[01:40:13] <Klevre> I need it to fit both dimensions, but with aspect ratio maintained, so the resulting image will be larger than the container and then have margin-left / margin-top set to make it align properly
[01:43:09] <MiracleBlue> Klevre: You can set the css width property of the image to the size you need and that should maintain the image aspect ratio as well
[01:43:43] <MiracleBlue> So long as you don't set both width and height
[01:44:00] <Klevre> MiracleBlue, yes but setting width to 100% and height to auto doesn't insure that the height is the right size
[01:44:57] <Klevre> I need the image to fit both dimensions
[01:45:13] <Klevre> cropped to fit with negative margins that is
[01:45:20] <DarkLobster> Anyone else getting "$.widget.extend is not a function" when loading jquery 1.8.2 and jquery-ui 1.9.0?
[01:45:29] <MiracleBlue> Klevre: So, you want to change the size of the image, while maintaining its aspect ratio, to a particular size?
[01:45:40] <Klevre> MiracleBlue, yes
[01:46:37] <MiracleBlue> Well, what I would do, is I'd check the image dimensions to see whether the image width or the image height is the largest value, and then change the css property of the one that is the lowest to fir the container
[01:47:09] <MiracleBlue> That should make sure that the image will always fill the whole container, whether its wide or tall :)
[01:47:18] <MiracleBlue> Is that what you're trying to do?
[01:48:11] <Klevre> MiracleBlue, will the image be "center" then?
[01:48:27] <nobitanobi> I am trying to change the extend for native JS and I have a doubt: https://gist.github.com/3957692 ‚Äî When extending the empty_finder which option would be?
[01:50:30] <MiracleBlue> Klevre: You can position the top and the left property to both be 50%, and then give the image a margin-top of negative half of the image height, and margin-left of negative half of the image width.  That should make sure its absolutely centred (I believe)
[01:51:22] <Myx0x3> http://jsfiddle.net/NW4F3/1/ why does it not work?
[01:52:48] <seutje> ?dnw
[01:52:50] <bot-t> seutje, Couldn't find "dnw" in jQuery Docs.
[01:52:58] <seutje> damnit, what's the factoid again?
[01:53:02] <seutje> Myx0x3: what doesn't work?
[01:53:17] <Myx0x3> seutje: it does not submit the form
[01:54:06] <alchimista> hi guys, i want to have a menu that is first close(just show 10% of the actual size) and when i click on that it remain open to show me the menu items, here is what i found on internet https://gist.github.com/88d0227cad24ea34836c
[01:54:16] <seutje> Myx0x3: when passing .submit a function, it's interpreted as an event handler, when passing nothing at all, it triggers the submit: http://jsfiddle.net/NW4F3/7/
[01:54:29] <seutje> we need to get rid of these shorthand methods :(
[01:54:35] <Klevre> MiracleBlue, it's messing up when both height and width are smaller than container
[01:55:04] <Myx0x3> seutje: but i need to do things after the submit :(
[01:55:20] <Myx0x3> seutje: i need to hide an div after the submit (it works, ive done it before)
[01:55:38] <Myx0x3> or is it the $(".TPSclass").live() that screw things up?
[01:57:13] <seutje> Myx0x3: binding and triggering are independent and it's generally not a good idea to bind an event handler from withing another event handler
[01:57:18] <seutje> Myx0x3: http://jsfiddle.net/NW4F3/8/
[01:57:31] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, like from document.ready? :D
[01:57:50] <alchimista> any one here wanna help me
[01:57:54] <alchimista> thanx in advance
[01:58:17] <Klevre> MiracleBlue, can't paste the code since it's part of a slider logic so pretty large code
[01:59:02] <MiracleBlue> Klevre: Just paste bin the relevant part :) or show me a demo of it?
[02:02:34] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: well that's not a conditional event ;)
[02:02:48] <seutje> actually, ur right, this is silly :P
[02:02:59] <seutje> could just throw it all in an .on
[02:03:17] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: http://jsfiddle.net/NW4F3/9/ HAPPY?
[02:03:52] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: you want me to take the capitals out of his class/id as well? :P
[02:04:06] <seutje> I'll also add some proper labels while I'm at it
[02:04:30] <seutje> tbh, I don't even know why there's any javascript in here
[02:04:43] <blackspotwiggins> lols
[02:04:46] <blackspotwiggins> take it easy man
[02:06:49] <seutje> blackspotwiggins, Myx0x3: http://jsfiddle.net/NW4F3/11/ :P
[02:07:59] <Myx0x3> lol, it still dont work as i want to :P anyway..
[02:09:07] <seutje> oh, right, ur div
[02:10:45] <seutje> Myx0x3: http://jsfiddle.net/NW4F3/12/
[02:13:01] <Myx0x3> seutje: well, i think im doing totaly wrong, but i dont know how to do it, lol.. we have an script that does something realy slow, and we want to show an loading div.. but yeah, i have problems showing and hideing the loading div.. the back button useally shows the div, and its nothing good :P
[02:13:55] <seutje> oh
[02:14:19] <Myx0x3> and i haveing problem if i should use submit, location.href and yeah..
[02:14:35] <Cork> Myx0x3: is the slow part in js or on server side?
[02:14:41] <Myx0x3> Cork: server side
[02:14:59] <Myx0x3> Cork: and i cant use load(), cause the CSS is fucking things upp the new page..
[02:15:23] <Cork> ouch not isolated enough
[02:15:32] <Myx0x3> its an mobile site, that sends to normal site
[02:15:50] <Myx0x3> so the CSS is conflicting
[02:16:21] <Myx0x3> i use normalizer.css, and our site from the stone age with special hacks everywhere get fucked up :/
[02:16:46] <Myx0x3> im in knee deep shit, lol
[02:16:54] <Cork> Myx0x3: ok, so you need to do a post to the server, the action takes a long time and then you want to show a result page?
[02:17:02] <Cork> or just a redirect?
[02:17:35] <Myx0x3> Cork: click button -> show "loading‚Ä¶" div -> show new site
[02:17:43] <Myx0x3> new page*
[02:17:54] <Cork> ya, but is the new page a result from the post or is it static?
[02:17:56] <Myx0x3> and i need to send some parameters, so..
[02:18:05] <Cork> ok, so a form result page
[02:18:16] <Myx0x3> yeah, kind of, i can use get
[02:18:22] <Cork> just show the loading from the submit event of the form
[02:18:26] <Myx0x3> i just need to have the parameters in the url
[02:18:31] <Cork> then do a normal submission
[02:18:38] <Cork> that should work just fine
[02:18:41] <Myx0x3> Cork: whats submission?
[02:18:53] <Cork> ah, not a post but a get
[02:18:56] <Myx0x3> Cork: cause if i push back in the browser, the div still shows, and thats a problem
[02:19:05] <Cork> hmm that makes it more interesting :)
[02:19:36] <Cork> mytoz: have you tried hiding it with the unload event?
[02:19:54] <Myx0x3> Cork: yes
[02:19:56] <Cork> that might be too early
[02:20:12] <Myx0x3> ive tryd everything, it feels like, lol
[02:20:25] <Cork> ok, then the only thing i can think of is to do it server side
[02:20:29] <Myx0x3> or wait, unload, hmm
[02:21:04] <Myx0x3> Cork: problem is if you do it serverside the browser dont execute it, cause it caches the last history i think?
[02:21:19] <Cork> no
[02:21:29] <Cork> you do a location header in the intermediate link
[02:21:36] <Cork> that should work fine
[02:21:59] <Cork> basically a 302 redirect
[02:22:15] <Cork> hmm no wait
[02:22:18] <Myx0x3> well, i dont think i want to do that, lol
[02:22:21] <Cork> that stops that page from showing :s
[02:22:35] <Cork> it would have to be a meta header
[02:22:40] <Cork> and... that sucks
[02:22:45] <Myx0x3> yeah
[02:23:14] <Myx0x3> the browsers should add an option to do things before the new page loads, lol
[02:23:23] <Myx0x3> maybe they want you to use ajax..
[02:23:44] <beluga> If I want to do stuff after jQuery UI accordion open/close, where should I put it? Like setting a variable to adjust to the content height change: tabletContent = parseFloat($('.twoCol').css("height") + $('.sideColumn').css("height"));
[02:23:49] <Cork> hmm that should work
[02:24:00] <Cork> Myx0x3: have you tried hiding the div on load?
[02:24:04] <Cork> that should work
[02:24:49] <Myx0x3> Cork: i can try, you mean like <script>$(document).ready(function() { $("div").hide()‚Ä¶.. ?
[02:25:33] <beluga> so where in the $.widget should I put it so it calculates properly? If I put in inside these open/close statements, it doesn't give the correct height value: if(_this.opened){ _this.close();}
[02:27:26] <Myx0x3> Cork: still dont work :S
[02:28:09] <Cork> Myx0x3: one sec
[02:29:13] <Cork> Myx0x3: http://jsfiddle.net/sTZW8/3/
[02:29:29] <Myx0x3> Cork: ive just tryd add alert() right after the body, and when i press back the alert does not show, untill i reload page
[02:29:31] <Cork> Myx0x3: the empty unload is important, else some browsers won't trigger the load on back
[02:30:26] <Myx0x3> Cork: yeah, that looks like it, but we have to se if it works in the iPhone safari browser, hehe
[02:30:37] <Myx0x3> Cork: give me a min to customize it.
[02:30:37] <Cork> :D
[02:30:44] <Myx0x3> Cork: maybe 2 min, my mom is calling me..
[02:30:48] <Cork> lol
[02:33:16] <Cork> Myx0x3: theres also an onpageshow event, that can be used if you don't want the empty onunload
[02:33:37] <Cork> Myx0x3: its what modern browsers call if you go back to a page thats not unloaded
[02:33:57] <Myx0x3> hmm okay..
[02:34:03] <Myx0x3> we try this first, lol
[02:34:14] <Cork> ?g mdn pageshow
[02:34:17] <bot-t> Cork, Using Firefox 1.5 caching | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_Firefox_1.5_caching
[02:34:59] <Cork> (it was mozilla that introduced it, but its part of the html5 spec)
[02:35:50] <Myx0x3> Cork: nope, still shows :( maybe we have to use onpageshow?
[02:35:57] <Cork> try it
[02:36:34] <Myx0x3> how do i use it? hehe
[02:36:51] <Cork> $(window).on('pageshow', function() {});
[02:37:24] <Myx0x3> should i replace it with $(window).unload(function() { });?
[02:37:28] <Myx0x3> or use both?
[02:38:58] <Myx0x3> Cork: i think it works now!!
[02:39:20] <Cork> you don't need the unload if you have pageshow
[02:39:48] <Cork> and actually you don't need the load event either
[02:39:57] <Myx0x3> Cork: this is my function: http://pastebin.com/C4ePkFwv
[02:39:59] <Myx0x3> and that works
[02:40:10] <Myx0x3> do i realy want to mess with it if it works? ;)
[02:40:38] <Cork> lol
[02:41:08] <Cork> you can do on('load pageshow', function() {})
[02:41:18] <Cork> that at least makes it deduped
[02:41:59] <greg_f> I wrote simple function to sum up time, here https://gist.github.com/3957865 but it has a bug, what it can be?
[02:42:01] <Myx0x3> Cork: like this? http://pastebin.com/6cUnb63Z
[02:42:11] <Myx0x3> Cork: sorry misspell
[02:42:26] * Cork nods
[02:43:55] <Myx0x3> Cork: wow thanks :) works like a charm! when ive built our site for mobile phones ive found tons of problems im not been able to find on google.. i should realy start an blogg, "100 things you encounter building an mobile site" lol
[02:44:26] <Myx0x3> or maybe: "100 things noobs encounter building an mobile site"  haha
[02:47:10] <Cork> Myx0x3: heh, i've seen most of there things cause i follow the webbrowser development quite closely
[02:47:47] <Hapzz> http://pastebin.com/Bn9xaPGK
[02:47:52] <Hapzz> why doesn't stop the form from submitting
[02:47:53] <Cork> sometimes you have to bang you're head trying to remember cause its ca 4-5 years between implementation and needing the knowledge :)
[02:47:58] <Myx0x3> Cork: hehe, yeah.. problem is nothing is documentet on the internet.. you have to be pro, or else youre fucked
[02:48:08] <Cork> but it really helps seeing it implemented
[02:48:20] <Cork> Myx0x3: its all documented
[02:48:35] <Cork> Myx0x3: but thats kinda the prob, theres so much its hard to find in it
[02:48:42] <Cork> you have to know what to look for
[02:48:54] <Cork> like https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_Firefox_1.5_caching in your case :)
[02:49:24] <Cork> Hapzz: you run preventDefault on event, not the jquery object
[02:49:38] <Cork> click(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[02:52:51] <Hapzz> still doesn't work
[02:53:29] <Cork> Hapzz: btw the return false; at the end shouldn't be there
[02:53:49] <Myx0x3> Cork: maybe in the deepest internet ;) fully encrypted, hehe
[02:53:56] <Hapzz> Cork still submits the form.
[02:54:07] <Cork> form?
[02:54:27] <Hapzz> it's a form, with a submit button, i want the jquery to prevent the submittion
[02:54:27] <Myx0x3> Cork: thing is, i do not use Firefox, thats why its hard to know if it works on webkit..
[02:54:34] <Cork> if you want to prevent a form submission you need to bind the .submit event
[02:54:43] <Hapzz> right.
[02:54:46] <Koopz> dun dun duuuunnn... i got a dialog. In the dialog i load a htmlpage with javascript... after closing the dialog the javascript still seems to be there... how to remove it?
[02:54:48] <Cork> Hapzz: you should always use .submit on the form if you have one
[02:54:55] <Cork> Hapzz: not the submit button
[02:55:06] <Hapzz> "go learn jquery" they said...
[02:55:09] <Hapzz> "it'll be easy!" they said
[02:55:15] <Cork> Hapzz: another thing 'button#save' is a bad selector no need for button there
[02:55:33] <Cork> Hapzz: jquery makes it easier
[02:55:40] <Hapzz> this works. thank's so much.
[02:55:46] <Cork> but you still have to know how dom and event works
[02:56:06] <Hapzz> i'm learning the hardw ay
[02:56:12] <Cork> Hapzz: remember to move the ajax call to the submit event
[02:56:26] <Hapzz> i just did, and it works..
[02:56:27] <Cork> else normal submission habbits won't work
[02:56:31] <Cork> k
[02:57:14] <Cork> Koopz: if you load the js into the global scope it will always be there
[02:57:29] <Cork> Koopz: javascript hangs around until all references to it is gone
[02:57:37] <Cork> (the gc removes it)
[02:57:58] <Cork> thats why its important to always scope you're code
[02:58:54] <jomofcw> Hello
[02:59:05] <Koopz> ...errm....
[03:00:45] <jomofcw> I can't understand the meaning of the scrollTop() method. In fact, I have a block element with a height of 578px, and when I'm to the max vertical scroll, .scrollTop() return me 415 oO.
[03:04:43] <Cork> jomofcw: viewport heigt + scroll top == page height; if you've scrolled to the bottom of it
[03:05:19] <Cork> its not the range compared to the bottom of the viewport
[03:06:03] <Cork> (so you can say its the number of pixels something sicks out above the viewport
[03:06:05] <Cork> )
[03:19:40] <colton> hi! i got a question regarding effects on a select element. if the user hasnt selected anything and wants to proceed, i highlight the select box with jqueryui .effect(...) function. if the select box gets focused, i want the effect to stop, so i added a handler for selectbox.focusin() which calls the .stop(true, true) function. i did the exact same thing for a text form, for this one it is working fine, but for the select element it isnt and the effect doesnt stop
[03:19:40] <colton> . anybody an idea about this behaviour?
[03:20:24] <jomofcw> Cork hello ! Yep thanks, I just missread the documentation :/
[03:38:14] <AdamPDotty> colton: maybe a fiddle would help
[03:38:57] <colton> AdamPDotty: ok one moment
[03:40:00] <Eviltwin> PSA: Big difference between: var $this = $(this) and var $this = ($this);
[03:40:26] <xec_> hehe
[03:40:31] <bezudar> Does jquery work with nodejs?
[03:40:35] <bezudar> anybody have any idea?
[03:41:06] <xec_> Eviltwin: had to read that three times before i noticed a difference (other than the ;)
[03:41:12] <clocKwize> psssst

[03:41:15] <clocKwize> wanna see something awesome?

[03:41:39] <bezudar> @eviltwin Thanks :)
[03:41:57] <bezudar> @clockwize :D
[03:43:16] <colton> AdamPDotty: nvm, i'm stupid and maybe blind -_- is there some IDE which spots like spelling mistakes?
[03:43:36] <bezudar> @colton eclipse does that
[03:43:36] <b-ot> bezudar, not tagged as amd within that containing module's build profile script?
[03:43:47] <colton> it does? i'm using aptana right now
[03:43:59] <colton> which is basically eclipse
[03:44:05] <bezudar> nah
[03:44:14] <bezudar> Aptana is quite bloated
[03:44:22] <bezudar> Eclipse WST is pretty cool
[03:44:31] <bezudar> I tried Aptana but dint work for me
[03:44:55] <colton> i'm not really satisfied with it, the auto completion sucks
[03:45:09] <colton> but i will give this one a try, thank you
[03:45:25] <bezudar> You worried about auto completion for jquery?
[03:45:31] <colton> in general
[03:45:37] <bezudar> go for eclipse
[03:45:44] <bezudar> dont worry about auto completion too much
[03:45:55] <colton> like i dont want to type out var/function names over and over
[03:45:57] <bezudar> I come from a Java environment and love auto completion
[03:46:02] <colton> exactly
[03:46:05] <colton> same
[03:46:17] <bezudar> use javascript editor with eclipse
[03:46:20] <bezudar> its quite nice.
[03:46:30] <bezudar> and keep the documentaion open
[03:46:36] <bezudar> thats the best way
[03:46:46] <colton> alright
[03:47:34] <colton> so
[03:48:01] <colton> does it support introspection for external libs/.js like i know from java?
[03:48:27] <bezudar> No
[03:48:32] <bezudar> You wont get that in java
[03:48:41] <bezudar> so use a library with great documentation
[03:48:56] <bezudar> I had a look at aptana/ ebay jet javascript ide and others
[03:49:04] <bezudar> no one does a good job
[03:49:12] <bezudar> and decreases productivity
[03:50:02] <colton> javascript itself decreases my productivity :D
[03:50:18] <bezudar> :D
[03:50:21] <colton> but i think
[03:50:26] <bezudar> No its pretty cool
[03:50:28] <colton> this is a matter of training
[03:50:30] <bezudar> have a look at nodejs
[03:50:32] <colton> to get the hang
[03:50:40] <bezudar> once you start writing
[03:50:43] <bezudar> its pretty cool
[03:50:56] <colton> but the whole non-typed language style is pretty hard on my mind
[03:51:33] <bezudar> I agree its looks like a brick wall at first
[03:51:38] <bezudar> but once you start writing
[03:51:45] <bezudar> its pretty cool
[03:52:12] <colton> yeah maybe :)
[03:52:28] <colton> i'm not really that much interested in webdevelopment and so on
[03:52:41] <colton> but atm i have to deal with it
[03:54:21] <colton> but thanks for your insight, will def take a look at it
[04:01:00] <vectorshelve> how to change the label of a text field.. label id "abc" using jquery ?
[04:01:21] <colton> .val() i think
[04:01:33] <Eviltwin> ?jqf @ vectorshelve
[04:01:34] <bot-t> vectorshelve, jQuery Fundamentals, a free online intro to jQuery - http://jqfundamentals.com
[04:01:47] <xec_> .val() won't change the label...
[04:01:58] <colton> oh
[04:02:06] <colton> then it's with .attr() ? :)
[04:02:22] <bezudar> attr() works everytime :)
[04:02:23] <xec_> no, label is a separate element
[04:02:31] <bezudar> you can select it
[04:02:37] <xec_> you're losing street cred here, guys ;)
[04:02:37] <bezudar> via selecting child
[04:02:54] <xec_> bezudar: child of a text field? don't think so :)
[04:02:54] <colton> xec_: which street cred? :D
[04:03:18] <bezudar> ahh right
[04:03:28] <bezudar> the label would have its own id
[04:03:47] <xec_> vectorshelve: i don't know of a sure-fire way to do that for any markup structure, so it depends on what your html structure is
[04:03:59] <xec_> bezudar: not neccessarily
[04:04:04] <bezudar> or select the element whose "for" is the id of textfield
[04:04:12] <vectorshelve> <label class="string optional control-label" for="user_login" id="login_label">Login</label>
[04:04:31] <vectorshelve> and i need to update the label value using jquery
[04:04:52] <xec_> vectorshelve: well, if you know the id of the label, just use .text()
[04:05:02] <bbt> how to prevent the window slidedown to the div when you click on a hashtag?
[04:05:17] <bezudar> @bbt
[04:05:19] <bezudar> return false
[04:05:49] <vectorshelve> $("label[for='user_login']").text("new_value");
[04:05:52] <bezudar> it treats it as a url and unless you return false it will try to html to it
[04:06:16] <bezudar> sorry :) It will direct to it
[04:06:56] <xec_> vectorshelve: that should work, yes.
[04:07:11] <bbt> ok. thanks
[04:08:38] <xec_> vectorshelve: i vaguely recall reading something about attribute value selectors should have the value in double quotes ('[for="user_login"]' instead of "[for='user_login']") but i'm not 100% on that
[04:08:56] <vectorshelve> xec_: thanks
[04:09:52] <colton> why wouldnt you do it this way? $("#login_label").text("text");
[04:10:29] <ravenzz> colton why not?
[04:11:02] <colton> no i'm just curious whats the difference to use with "for=.."
[04:11:02] <xec_> colton: indeed. that's what i was implying with the "if you know the id" comment earlier too
[04:11:21] <xec_> colton: but if you only have the id of the text field it makes sense
[04:11:56] <colton> ok so the "for" makes a link between the two elements. googled for "for" and got no good results ;)
[04:12:33] <xec_> colton: yes. check out https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/label
[04:12:45] <xec_> "for" is listed under attributes
[04:13:07] <ravenzz> colton you can have label that wraps form fields (in this case you don't need a ID/for attributes pair)
[04:13:46] <ravenzz> or separated label/formfield in this case the form field must have an ID
[04:13:47] <colton> i see, thank for the explanation :)
[04:16:13] <ravenzz> and the label a for attr
[04:22:48] <LordThumper> Hi
[04:23:13] <LordThumper> Is it possible to change the default value for jQueryUI widgets?
[04:23:41] <LordThumper> I need to change 'firstDay' option for all Datepickers
[04:23:41] <Eviltwin> Generally yes
[04:23:49] <Eviltwin> Oh, for all datepickers?
[04:23:50] <Eviltwin> Why?
[04:24:47] <LordThumper> I have several datepickers on different pages, and need them all, and future datepickers to have this default value
[04:25:02] <Eviltwin> Looks like it can't be done without modifying the source
[04:25:13] <Eviltwin> But can't you just always override it?
[04:25:22] <LordThumper> Yes I can
[04:25:50] <Eviltwin> Or make a helper method to do that for you
[04:25:58] <LordThumper> However it would, in my opinion, be more elegant to change the default value in the pages' header
[04:26:58] <LordThumper> And I prefer not to modify the source. If i have to update jQuery UI in the future, I need to change it again
[04:27:32] <Eviltwin> You could try tweaking $.datepicker._defaults
[04:27:36] <duderion> hi gues, i have written a script, that runs thorugh a table and colors every td, thats filled with a number in a specific color.
[04:27:36] <Eviltwin> See if that works
[04:27:53] <LordThumper> Ok, thanks Eviltwin :)
[04:28:02] <duderion> but the damn IE8 seems to run into a timeout
[04:28:17] <duderion> i dunno how to optimize the loop ;/
[04:28:35] <Eviltwin> Uh... how big is this table?
[04:28:40] <duderion> not very big
[04:28:59] <duderion> example 2 tables
[04:29:01] <duderion> 9x16 both
[04:29:05] <Eviltwin> Then either you have a bug and you're going into an infinite loop, or you're not actually timing out, something else is happening
[04:29:20] <duderion> i get errors with unsupported functions
[04:29:33] <duderion> but my code only consists of 2 for loops and some selectors
[04:29:43] <duderion> wait, ill pastebin it
[04:29:55] <duderion> hope i dont get killed ;
[04:30:46] <duderion> http://pastebin.com/n1sfKkrB
[04:30:48] <duderion> thats it
[04:33:15] <xec_> duderion: looks like you're running a selector inside a loop (inside a loop (inside a loop))
[04:33:28] <duderion> ehm
[04:34:11] <xec_> duderion: do you have a sample of your markup?
[04:34:32] <duderion> i could do a screenshot of the table if you like
[04:34:43] <duderion> the table id like to color up...
[04:34:44] <xec_> no, i want to know the html structure
[04:34:48] <duderion> k
[04:35:02] <duderion> wait a sec
[04:35:10] <vectorshelve> is there a way I can have two value attribute for a select tag under dropdown ?
[04:35:12] <xec_> although if you have a picture of the desired result, thats very nice too
[04:36:17] <xec_> vectorshelve: i couldn't make much sense of that, but if you're asking what it looks like you're asking, then no. you can only have one value attribute on an element:P
[04:37:06] <xec_> vectorshelve: you can have multiple options of a <select> selected though
[04:37:55] <duderion> xec: http://pastebin.com/b8fphLpb
[04:38:04] <duderion> this is the html markup of the table(s)
[04:38:40] <duderion> its running in typo3
[04:39:30] <duderion> and i simpy detect the float numbers and give those fields a sepcific color
[04:39:36] <duderion> runs in FF, Safari, Chrome
[04:39:49] <duderion> but IE sucks (again, and again, and again ;])
[04:40:59] <duderion> thanks in advance man
[04:42:16] <xec_> duderion: just to make sure, does this testcase have the same issue? http://jsfiddle.net/fT3HT/
[04:42:42] <duderion> ill take a look
[04:42:47] <xec_> i basically just copypasted the code, but i only have ie10
[04:45:38] <duderion> unfortunately yes
[04:45:49] <xec_> ok good
[04:46:14] <xec_> (that means the issue is indeed with this code and not some other part of your site)
[04:46:59] <duderion> jep
[04:47:02] <duderion> its definitely the code
[04:47:11] <duderion> i disabled it and everything runs fine
[04:47:24] <xec_> duderion: how about this http://jsfiddle.net/fT3HT/1/
[04:49:56] <duderion> works pretty fast
[04:50:06] <duderion> its not the regex
[04:50:10] <duderion> i alreay checked that
[04:50:40] <xec_> right
[04:50:57] <xec_> i think it's the silly $('.contenttable tr:nth-child('+row+') td:nth-child('+col+')') being run over and over and over that's the culprit
[04:51:05] <duderion> yep
[04:51:10] <duderion> i also think this is it
[04:51:43] <duderion> but i actually dont find a way around it...
[04:51:59] <xec_> duderion: so what i suggest is you do *one* selector at the beginning that selects the cells you want, maybe something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/fT3HT/3/
[04:52:35] <duderion> okok
[04:54:33] <Logikos> xec_: just for my own education, how does this work? $(".contenttable tr + tr td + td") .. specificly the tr + tr td + td ?
[04:55:13] <duderion> ill give it a try
[04:55:16] <duderion> look cool
[04:55:29] <Eviltwin> A td that is right after a td somewhere inside a tr that is right after a tr somewhere inside a .contenttable
[04:55:32] <xec_> Logikos: the + is the sibling combinator, check out http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/adjacentsiblingselector
[04:55:50] <xec_> i'm basically just avoiding the first row and the first column
[04:56:08] <duderion> :D
[04:56:21] <Logikos> thanks, i wasnt aware you could do that with that kind of notation ... i'll checkout the link
[04:58:43] <vectorshelve> how to do this ? https://gist.github.com/3958385
[04:58:50] <duderion> xec_: man, you absolutely ROCK
[04:59:06] <duderion> this siblings selector is around 50times faster than my foot-by-foot solution!
[04:59:14] <duderion> *shame*
[05:00:35] <xec_> yw :)
[05:00:57] <jediscript> hi! i have a problem. how can i store data from a form (a form with 1 personal info, and multiple orders)?
[05:01:10] <xec_> vectorshelve: you can use .attr() to read attributes
[05:01:25] <xec_> vectorshelve: like .attr("data-id")
[05:01:42] <vectorshelve> xec_: thanks
[05:02:05] <xec_> you can also do .data("id") which is sort of a dirty shorthand for attributes starting with "data-"
[05:02:36] <duderion> xec_ is the masterblaster
[05:02:44] <duderion> greets from germany *bow*
[05:03:04] <vectorshelve> xec_: nice
[05:03:25] <xec_> but now, it's time for cake! *afk*
[05:07:08] <Somatt_wrk> it seems jquery.loda() isn't triggered in ipad (or not always triggered). Is there any way around this ?
[05:07:34] <vectorshelve> xec_: https://gist.github.com/3958385 can I do it this way ?
[05:07:42] <jediscript> what I did was i have a form (personal info) then a <div> with the order form, everytime the user clicks add, the data (json) is added to an array. now my problem is how can I process the data from the form (personal info) and from the array before i send it to my model.php via ajax? has anyone encountered this same problem?
[05:09:51] <vectorshelve> https://gist.github.com/3958385 is this a right way ?
[05:19:34] <xec_> vectorshelve: what?
[05:19:44] <xec_> no
[05:20:31] <vectorshelve> xec_: it didnt work
[05:20:32] <xec_> first of all, to set an attribute using .attr() you send it a second argument .attr("data-id", "new value")
[05:20:55] <vectorshelve>     _companyID = $('#select_company option:selected').attr("data-id")     $('#select_company option:selected').val(_companyID)
[05:21:01] <vectorshelve> xec_: this worked ^^
[05:21:44] <xec_> if you want the value to be 2, why don't you do value="2" in the html?
[05:22:28] <xec_> this looks really messy
[05:23:05] <mazzachre> Is there somewhere with good tutorial or demo info on the deffereds and promise/js?
[05:26:41] <Eviltwin> mazzachre: Perhaps see ?learn
[05:26:41] <bot-t> mazzachre, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[05:26:46] <Eviltwin> Might be in that second link
[05:26:57] <VectorX> hi, i am getting and array when trying to output data in the complete function, whats wrong with this, im getting json coded data which is in the HTML part, http://jsfiddle.net/XfSGe/
[05:28:16] <VectorX> the data['wp_latest'] part is what the issue is with
[05:28:23] <VectorX> am i referencing it wrong
[05:28:50] <vectorshelve> xec_: no the value is dynamic :)
[05:28:58] <Eviltwin> vectorshelve: http://jsfiddle.net/XfSGe/2/
[05:28:59] <vectorshelve> xec_: that was just an example I gave
[05:29:28] <mazzachre> O'rly... Well I might already know javascript and jqeury, and only ask about a specific aspect? Whatever
[05:29:33] <Eviltwin> VectorX: ^
[05:29:37] <Eviltwin> VectorX: You need the capital T
[05:30:09] <Eviltwin> mazzachre: I said "Might be in that second link"
[05:30:29] <Eviltwin> mazzachre: http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/ajax-deferreds
[05:30:30] <Eviltwin> And it is
[05:30:34] <Eviltwin> Might try reading next time
[05:32:03] <VectorX> Eviltwin still no dice, alert(data['wp_latest']); says undefined
[05:33:01] <xec_> VectorX: do you see the wp_latest if you set a breakpoint and inspect the data var?
[05:33:19] <HarryPitfall> why use attr('data-id') if you can use .data('id') ?
[05:33:33] <HarryPitfall> afaik, all data- attributes are mapped to .data()
[05:33:43] <xec_> HarryPitfall: because .data() is overloaded and can be confusing
[05:34:03] <xec_> HarryPitfall: .attr() only reads/writes attributees, so the intent is clear
[05:34:05] <Eviltwin> HarryPitfall: The first time you use .data() the HTML5 data-* attributes get translated into the object
[05:34:15] <Eviltwin> From then on .data() will only operate on that object
[05:34:24] <Eviltwin> It will not change the HTML5 attributes nor will it read from the HTML5 attributes
[05:34:52] <HarryPitfall> .data() is binded with the dom element
[05:34:54] <b-ot> HarryPitfall, memorised ‚Äúdata()‚Äù.
[05:35:05] <xec_> silly b-ot
[05:35:26] <xec_> HarryPitfall: no it's not. re-read what Eviltwin just told you
[05:35:32] <Eviltwin> rmill: ^
[05:35:41] <Eviltwin> It's being silly again
[05:36:33] <Eviltwin> HarryPitfall: If you'd like to read more about it, see: http://api.jquery.com/data/#data-html5
[05:37:10] <HarryPitfall> the .data() is binded to the dom element, but not rewrite into the tags
[05:37:18] <HarryPitfall> if you create a new $() object
[05:37:23] <HarryPitfall> from same dom element
[05:37:30] <HarryPitfall> you get the same .data() values
[05:37:31] <VectorX> xec_ cant say i do, data seems to be a bit object with a lot of stuff, and it has one item called responseText that has that entire string
[05:37:32] <xec_> i was a bit quick with the "no it's not" comment btw. it does inded attach data to the dom element
[05:37:37] <xec_> indeed*
[05:38:14] <VectorX> why am i not getting the simple json in it
[05:38:17] <xec_> but it does not map directly to the attributes, so if the data- attribute is changed, the data object won't
[05:38:54] <xec_> VectorX: did you fix the dataType option?
[05:39:00] <VectorX> xec_ yes
[05:39:24] <xec_> ok, so what does the data object look like
[05:39:39] <xec_> and what does the raw response look like
[05:39:46] <VectorX> its got a whole bunch of funstions, abort, always, complete, done, error, etc
[05:42:15] <Eviltwin> HarryPitfall: http://jsfiddle.net/cEgvR/
[05:42:41] <Eviltwin> HarryPitfall: Or http://jsfiddle.net/cEgvR/1/
[05:42:42] <xec_> VectorX: that sounds like a deferred
[05:43:41] <Eviltwin> HarryPitfall: You're correct that if every piece of code on the site is using jQuery's .data() method to manipulate the data, you're fine.
[05:43:43] <xec_> VectorX: you're inside the complete callback right?
[05:43:47] <VectorX> yes
[05:44:00] <Eviltwin> But that's frequently not a reasonable assumption
[05:44:10] <xec_> aha
[05:44:38] <xec_> VectorX: try the success callback :)
[05:44:55] <evilgeenius> I have some validation functions on blur() on some text boxes.  When the form is submitted, i run each of the blurs.  What's the best way to tell if the validation have failed within the click() of the submit button?
[05:45:37] <VectorX> xec_ that worked
[05:45:54] <VectorX> but whats wrong with complete ?
[05:46:40] <xec_> it's a different callback, for a different purpose.
[05:47:16] <VectorX> so i need to be using success ?
[05:47:26] <xec_> yes. or you could just do $.ajax().done(callback) instead
[05:47:31] <VectorX> i spent like 4 hours today trying to figure this out
[05:48:50] <xec_> VectorX: the complete will fire even if the ajax fails
[06:14:06] <boulet101010_> $("<button>",{html:"text"}) shoud be correct to create a <button>text</button> nop ?
[06:15:17] <LordThumper> Try text instead of html
[06:15:41] <LordThumper> $("<button />",{text:"text"})
[06:15:58] <blizzkid> Lo all. Completely new to jquery/javascript, I'm using Facebox (defunkt.io/facebox/) to show a popup. Now in that popup is a couple of form fields. When submitting the form, and closing the popup, I need to put that info in some input fields on the main page, and unhide the hidden div
[06:16:01] <boulet101010_> i'm so dumb sorry
[06:16:06] <boulet101010_> height : 5px
[06:16:08] <boulet101010_> ...
[06:16:16] <blizzkid> Any suggestions for this noob?
[06:16:59] <blizzkid> I tried $(document).bind('afterClose.facebox', function() {  $("#user_name").val(name.value);
[06:17:09] <blizzkid> but that doesn't work.
[06:17:17] <blizzkid> Maybe I put it in the wrong place?
[06:20:26] <blizzkid> Or simpler: how can I rewrite mother.frmAmbassadeur.user_name.value = document.RegionPopup.name.value; to jquery?
[06:20:45] <blizzkid> (although I'm not sure that'll work with facebox)
[06:30:25] <alx-> Hello,
[06:32:09] <alx-> I'm getting json requests that include html characters  eg. &amp;   how can i decode them?
[06:34:04] <jomofcw> I just update to jquery 1.8.2, but now my colorbox plugin seems to not load, it tell me "colorbox" undefined
[06:34:29] <jomofcw> Any known issue ?
[06:34:48] <boulet101010_> the plugin isn't loaded at start
[06:35:21] <boulet101010_> paste the anchors
[06:35:26] <seutje> alx-: var div = document.createElement('div'); div.innerHtml = theString; theString = div.innerText; or something?
[06:35:53] <seutje> but try to limit theString to plain text only, no html elements and shit
[06:35:57] <seutje> or it'll fuck em up
[06:36:58] <jomofcw> boulet101010_ is that for me ? What do you mean by "the plgin isn't load at start" ? please.
[06:37:32] <boulet101010_> what i mean is that the plugin is loaded after your function call.
[06:37:37] <boulet101010_> or not loaded at all
[06:38:13] <jomofcw> boulet101010_ I already check that, and the colorbox file is correctly loaded and before I call it :/
[06:38:46] <jomofcw> And when I test in console $.colorbox() it answer me again that colorbox is undefined.
[06:39:18] <jomofcw> It work really well before jQuery update :/. And in fact I just change the jQuery file, nothing else
[06:44:34] <jomofcw> OK it doesn't load any of my jQuery plugin anymore :/.
[06:44:55] <jomofcw> Is there a change in the jQuery 1.8.2 way of load plugin ?
[06:46:34] <kolix> Hi guys, I'm getting some jquery error in chorme
[06:47:16] <skh_> Hey all.  I am using a PHP array to eventually create a js object.  For one of the object properties, I need it to be an anonymous function.  But when I make that setting in PHP jQuery thinks it's a string and not a function.  Is there anyway I can change that property in the settings object to be a function and not a string?
[06:47:40] <kolix> http://pastie.org/5118946
[06:47:43] <kolix> any ideas?
[06:48:28] <jomofcw> OK, if I cc the colorbox plugin line (from the minified source file) and then I call $.colorbox() it's OK. But it can't load it from my original file at page load :/.
[06:48:56] <skh_> Here's an example of what I mean (datepicker).  Need beforeShowDay to be a function and not a string: http://jsfiddle.net/tjv4N/
[06:50:54] <ajpiano> kolix: $ isn't jQuery
[06:51:12] <kolix> ?
[06:51:16] <ajpiano> skh_: generating js functions in php isn't a very good idea
[06:51:26] <ajpiano> kolix: in your page, the variable $ is pointing to prototype, not jQuery
[06:51:30] <kolix> jquery has no $.ajax call?
[06:51:59] <ajpiano> it does, but that error is echoing out prototype's code
[06:52:16] <jomofcw> Hm, i've got the same problem with 1.7.2 and 1.8.2, but not with 1.7.1 ...
[06:52:20] <kolix> i have no prootype anywhere on the page
[06:52:44] <skh_> ajpiano, it's using a CMS API just to set the settings, so I am stuck
[06:52:51] <kolix> I'm no tusing prototype anywhere on the site
[06:53:21] <kolix> ajpiano, could it be something else?
[06:53:34] <ajpiano> kolix: are you using something else that is taking the $ variable
[06:53:47] <ajpiano> kolix: type $ === jQuery in your console
[06:53:49] <ajpiano> it will come out false
[06:55:10] <rmill> Eviltwin: he's not hurtin' nobody.
[06:55:20] <kolix> ajpiano, this computer has add-ons installed
[06:55:20] <rmill> Eviltwin: we be workin' the kinks out.
[06:55:29] <jomofcw> I use minify to combine many JS script relative to jQuery, perhaps it comes from it... ?
[06:55:32] <kolix> the error doesnt show up when add-ons are enabled
[06:55:55] <kolix> google chrome btw
[06:55:58] <ajpiano> kolix: sounds like some bad add ons that are screwing with the global scope of the page when they're running
[06:56:30] <kolix> yeah i think you're right
[06:56:46] <Heather_> how can I target a specific element and remove it without deleting the content inbetween?
[06:59:32] <ajpiano> skh_: indeed you are
[06:59:56] <Somatt_wrk> it seems jquery.load() isn't triggered in ipad (or not always triggered). Is there any way around this ?
[07:00:07] <ajpiano> if your only way to write JS is to generate it from PHP inside of a CMS, you probably need to reevaluate how that's all working and figure out how to actually write, not *generate*, js
[07:01:00] <skh_> ajpiano, I'm just going to alter the generated settings object in a ustom js file.. not ideal but I can't think of anything more clever
[07:02:44] <PBDev> QUESTION: I have a jquery menu, and I want the submenus to be minimized on page load. How?
[07:04:24] <PBDev> hello. any 1
[07:08:26] <rod__> which is the best way to upload files via ajax?
[07:08:38] <clocKwize> rod__, there is no best way
[07:09:04] <clocKwize> your own options are basically flash uploaders or HTML5 stuff that degrades to the standard input type="file"
[07:09:52] <rod__> open source
[07:09:54] <rod__> clocKwize:  is there any good one?
[07:09:56] <jomofcw> Here are my minified jQuery's files : http://pastebin.com/PC5epWpn . In fact each thing relative to jQuery Core work well, but each other script coming after the jQuery Core script (including jQuery UI) doesn't work ("... is undefined"). It do that using jQuery 1.7.2 or 1.8.2, but it work well using jQuery 1.7.1. Any idea please :/ ?
[07:10:21] <clocKwize> rod__, http://www.uploadify.com/ is quite good
[07:10:29] <rod__> clocKwize:  thanks
[07:11:34] <cbart> I have a table that calls an ajax request to update some data on the server. for each row in the table there is an onclick with the id of the data being updated. each new request also calls the last requests that were called.
[07:12:56] <cbart> so, if i call the request on id 1 and then on id 3, the ajax sends the request for id 3 and then id 1Ö so all the rows end up with the same data.
[07:14:11] <PBDev> QUESTION: I have a jquery menu, that work, collapsing and expanding submenus. I just want the submenus to be expanded on page load. But how? Please help. http://pastebin.com/ZhSepRLn
[07:16:40] <vectorshelve> I am udapting the label of a field based on the option selected from a dropdown.. but the label isnt getting set for the first element in the dropdown when the page loads initially... later when i select different options from the drop down the labels are getting update. what do I need to do to update for the first select option when the page loads ?
[07:23:56] <cardguy10> I'm having difficulty selecting what I think I can do with next(), I have 6 anchor tags and after every two I have a <div class='clear'></div> followed by another two anchors.  If the anchor immediately before the clear div has a class of selected I'd like to then select the next anchor tag after the div.  I tried next('a') without luck, I also tried setting the next to a var and doing another next() on the next var
[07:24:02] <cardguy10> http://pastebin.com/rJ52iAps
[07:25:10] <Hapzz> so i have a form with 1 hidden input and like 10 text inputs. $('form').serialize() only makes use of the hidden input and ignores the text inputs. any ideas why?
[07:26:01] <Hapzz> it's inputs inside divs inside the form
[07:26:04] <Hapzz> maybe that's why?
[07:28:11] <alx-> seutje: thanks!
[07:34:38] <MACscr> i have a very simple form, so simple its just a single field to upload a file and a submit button. Anyway, whats the best method for doing the upload? Its just a csv file, so nothing large that needs file progress. Ive read that .ajax() isnt the best method for that. Am i wrong?
[07:34:41] <alwayslearning> can anyone help me figure out why my jquery effects are not working? http://devserverexclusive.com/terry/#
[07:34:41] <vectorshelve> I want to run this command $('#select_company').change(); on page load... what is the syntax ?
[07:36:12] <nchlssmith1> $(document).ready(function() {});
[07:42:52] <kzrdt> hi
[07:44:44] <kzrdt> Is there a way to hide select options depending on another select values and show others options (or initial values)? The only idea that I came from is to keep initial values in a variable? Are you seing others?
[07:48:21] <nchlssmith1> kzrdt:i dont see why you could hide or disable options
[07:48:29] <jomofcw> Here are my minified jQuery's files : http://pastebin.com/PC5epWpn . In fact each thing relative to jQuery Core work well, but each other script coming after the jQuery Core script (including jQuery UI) doesn't work ("... is undefined"). It do that using jQuery 1.7.2 or 1.8.2, but it work well using jQuery 1.7.1. Any idea please :/ ?
[07:49:12] <kzrdt> nchlssmith1:  Isn't it possible? To hide options from a select input?
[07:49:27] <kzrdt> nchlssmith1: or remove them?
[07:50:05] <nchlssmith1> kzrdt:yes you can hide them or remove them.  If they are going to come back you might want to just hide them.
[07:50:47] <nchlssmith1> $("option specificClass").hide()
[07:50:57] <kzrdt> nchlssmith1: So I didn't understood your first message
[07:51:04] <ajpiano> jomofcw: a live demo of the page that's failing will help someone debug your problem a lot better, none of us are personally javascript engines who can interpret 1000s of lines of minified code in our brains
[07:51:10] <nchlssmith1> kzrdt: see above
[07:53:11] <kzrdt> Thanks :) I will check on that
[07:58:56] <sunbeam> hi, i'd like to capture the value of a slider i am using.. how can i best do this?
[07:59:09] <HarryPitfall> there is a quick filter on jQuery for the 'html' or 'text' inside a element?
[07:59:14] <p1key> I currently have a site that has a upload feature and as well multiple upload feature,using jQuery
[07:59:24] <p1key> However, to add another image (multiple images upload), it requires to BROWSE again
[07:59:31] <p1key> FileDialog
[07:59:40] <p1key> I want to make it, once you browse first time, to be able to select multiple ages using CTRL key.
[07:59:53] <p1key> And once you select an image using the browse button, if it happens to miss some image, you can click again browse in the same button and it adds the image to the multiple images
[08:00:00] <p1key> e.g something like imgur
[08:00:21] <HarryPitfall> p1key, the only option that I can think now is use flash solutions
[08:00:24] <p1key> any ideas how i can do this? or if there is any code available that can help me with this?
[08:00:58] <HarryPitfall> I'm using swfupload to upload images on my website
[08:01:16] <felipe_Brz> could anyone explain to me why i can't set the html on this div?? http://jsfiddle.net/4f8jt/1/
[08:01:19] <felipe_Brz> example and error included
[08:04:21] <faraway> felipe_Brz: well get() does not return a jquery object but the native html node
[08:05:10] <HarryPitfall> change .get(1) to .eq(1)
[08:06:02] <scarlet_razor> how to convert integer to monthname ?
[08:06:06] <scarlet_razor> anyone ?
[08:07:02] <faraway> scarlet_razor: in the correct language ?
[08:07:11] <Hapzz> $('input[name="test"]').parent().parent().html() shows right output
[08:07:19] <Hapzz> $('input[name="test"]').parent().parent().css() is blank/null
[08:07:24] <Hapzz> even though it has a class set to it
[08:07:39] <NoiseEee> ask for the class then Hapzz
[08:07:48] <NoiseEee> and use a better selector than parent().parent()
[08:07:55] <scarlet_razor> faraway: in jquery language
[08:08:21] <faraway> scarlet_razor: no i mean if you need it multilingual :D
[08:08:35] <jomofcw> Yup, ajpiano you're right. But in fact it seems the problem come from the minify.
[08:09:02] <ajpiano> so put a page that has the minified code in it i guess
[08:09:08] <scarlet_razor> my country for example indonesia hehe.. faraway sorry...
[08:10:17] <sunbeam> Does anyone know what the right way is to capture WHEN someone clicks on the jQuery ui-slider?
[08:10:21] <sunbeam> .blur ?
[08:10:23] <sunbeam> or which is it
[08:10:38] <faraway> scarlet_razor: either create an array ["Jan", "Feb", ...]¬†in your lanuage then you can convert form the month as int to the string.
[08:11:18] <faraway> scarlet_razor: or use momentjs.com if you also need some other date functionality
[08:12:11] <scarlet_razor> faraway: thanks it as i see in w3 shoools web.. is there any simple function ?
[08:12:13] <scarlet_razor> with jquery not javascript based....
[08:12:14] <felipe_Brz> HarryPitfall:  hmm... eq(1)?? never heard of it.. will try it tahnnks!!!!!
[08:12:51] <jomofcw> Hm ajpiano I have it on a dev environment, and can't open it to others :/... I should find the solution alone there. I ask the author of the minify script if he knows something about it.
[08:13:27] <ajpiano> ok best of luck, i can't really look at it right now anyway, i was just saying that pasting your entire minified source with multiple libraries and hoping someone's randomly gonna point out the problem is not a likely solution :p
[08:15:01] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Came across one of your answers on stackoverflow, helps a lot. Thanks!
[08:16:51] <faraway> scarlet_razor: that are 3 lines of code if you write your own function for one language and as i sayed if you want to use it for multiple languages use e.g. momentojs ... and jquery is javascript
[08:17:14] <EHLOVader> sunbeam: it would be the change event
[08:17:19] <EHLOVader> on the slider
[08:17:32] <scarlet_razor> faraway: i know it javascript ... :D
[08:17:39] <EHLOVader> http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#event-change
[08:18:12] <sunbeam> EHLOVader: great
[08:18:13] <sunbeam> sec
[08:19:19] <jomofcw> Yea sure ajpiano xD.
[08:19:30] <jomofcw> Anyway, thanks you ajpiano :).
[08:19:34] <EHLOVader> that should fire during the slider's slide sunbeam... letting you update on the fly
[08:20:25] <EHLOVader> if you only want when the user stops sliding, but focus hasn't been lost, you can use the stop event
[08:24:26] <sunbeam> EHLOVader: $('.slider').on('change',function(){
[08:24:29] <sunbeam> doesnt work for me
[08:25:30] <dennisbot> hi, how can I attach the same function in multiples anchor tags
[08:25:44] <dennisbot> I mean the click event
[08:26:42] <ajpiano> sunbeam: $(".slider").slider({ change: function(e,ui){})) or .on("slidechange", function(e, ui) {}); http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#event-change
[08:26:43] <johnkpaul> dennisbot: $('.anchor-selector1, .anchor-selector-2').on('click', clickHandler)
[08:28:14] <EHLOVader> sunbeam: I set mine up from the start $("#price_slider").slider({slide:update_price_filter,change:update_products});
[08:29:10] <sunbeam> sec
[08:30:05] <sunbeam> the slider nearest to name="user[option1]"
[08:30:08] <sunbeam> how can i best find this?
[08:30:10] <sunbeam> .nearest?
[08:31:05] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: There's closest() which looks up the closest parent?
[08:31:44] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: It really depends on your markup.
[08:32:07] <BillCriswell> You could need next() or prev() or find() or closest()
[08:32:55] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: http://api.jquery.com/category/Traversing/
[08:33:00] <sunbeam> so how would that be
[08:33:34] <sunbeam>  $("input[name='options[user1]'").nearest(".slider")
[08:33:37] <sunbeam> like this?
[08:34:00] <BillCriswell> I don't know what your HTML looks like. There's also no .nearest()
[08:34:25] <sunbeam> eh i mean closest
[08:34:54] <BillCriswell> I still don't know what your HTML looks like .closest() could be useless to you.
[08:35:45] <sunbeam> oh sorry
[08:35:52] <BillCriswell> I double it's .closest() since an input would not be inside a slider.
[08:36:09] * shoky triples
[08:36:20] <sunbeam> next probably
[08:36:34] <kelye> hello, anyone using fancybox ? ... I have some problems with dynamic content
[08:36:42] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: So $input.next('.slider')
[08:37:02] <BillCriswell> shoky: Are we talking softball or baseball?
[08:37:04] <sunbeam> yep thanks works
[08:37:05] <sunbeam> but
[08:37:40] <shoky> i barely know anything about those sports. so uhh, yeah
[08:38:03] <sunbeam> how do I get the current value of the slider BillCriswell
[08:38:21] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: Did you read the manual at all?
[08:39:14] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: http://jqueryui.com/slider/#steps and there's a "view source" link at the bottom.
[08:40:10] <kelye> I'm opening a jqueryUI dialong with some ajax content loaded.. in the open: callback of the dialog I have something like  $('#content').on('click', 'a', function() { $(this).fancybox()})
[08:40:29] <kelye> but it's not triggering fancybox
[08:44:01] <BillCriswell> kelye: $(this).fancybox().trigger('click') maybe?
[08:46:25] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: ok
[08:46:35] <kelye> fithat would start an infinite recursion..
[08:48:32] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: ok i get it now
[08:48:54] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: but interestingly, <input value="") doesn't change when i look at the input field with firebug
[08:49:22] <sunbeam> Any idea how come?
[08:50:43] <BillCriswell> kelye: Good catch. Still early! http://jsfiddle.net/QnLZY/
[08:52:21] <ypahnu> hi. i can't get spinner.change to work.. can you help me
[08:52:50] <BillCriswell> kelye: Wait, something still feels off. =/
[08:53:36] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: any idea?
[08:53:42] <kelye> works on the second click
[08:53:44] <ypahnu> var sni=$('#sni').spinner().change( function(){ console.log('action'); }); // isn't like this?
[08:53:48] <BillCriswell> kelye: Yeah. Hmm.
[08:53:49] <kelye> but no worries, it's a start
[08:53:59] <BillCriswell> Yeah, that options page should have something for you.
[08:54:06] <BillCriswell> I did this the other day and I can't recall sadly.
[08:54:40] <BillCriswell> kelye: http://fancybox.net/api should have something for you though.
[08:56:04] <dennisbot> johnkpaul: :( I did what you told me, but it works just in an outside example I'm not know why is not working for my anchor in my code I should suposse something else is breaking the on function? I'm using bootstrap from twitter
[08:56:41] <johnkpaul> ?demo @dennisbot
[08:56:42] <bot-t> dennisbot, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:58:00] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: You have to read the manual. I'm not helping you by telling you exactly how to do something. The link I sent you shows you exactly how to do what you asked.
[08:58:26] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: i get it nvm
[08:58:47] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: and what if i based on the change live wanted to update the css of the element? I know how .css() works
[08:58:56] <sunbeam> but that isn't what i need because its not live
[09:03:47] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: Did you try googling it?
[09:03:57] <kelye> BillCriswell: ... I just figured out that I got that working in the first 5 mins and for over an hour I'm trying to access the wrong link ..
[09:04:03] <kelye> fml ..
[09:04:07] <kelye> ty for your time
[09:04:16] <BillCriswell> kelye: No problem at all! Glad I could help.
[09:04:21] <BillCriswell> Been there and done that as well
[09:04:43] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: yes
[09:05:04] <sunbeam> I need to edit an element with jquery .css, the element has been created AFTER the page load
[09:05:12] <sunbeam> so i cannot just change it
[09:05:44] <Heather_> how can I remove <strong> in <p id="someid"><strong>text</strong></p>
[09:07:23] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: i checked with $("#element").length if the div exists, but it doesnt
[09:07:33] <sunbeam> but i can view it when i click on the element with firebug
[09:07:38] <sunbeam> any idea what might be wrong?
[09:08:02] <sunbeam> btw, it exists in an iframe
[09:08:26] <sunbeam> is that maybe the problem?
[09:08:37] <dennisbot> johnkpaul: here is it! http://jsfiddle.net/DSFvd/6/, it's the first time I do this I hope the link it's ok
[09:09:44] <dennisbot> it's not working for the two buttons but for the div with limegreen it's ok, I want them to be all ok!
[09:10:04] <ideaprison> okay this will sound weird but i have a div that reacts on scrolling on it, but it also at the same time scrolls the page, what is the best way to not have the page scroll/react to scrolling on that div? http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/neZPK/ (while we're at it, is there a way to get it to work in firefox too, or you cant bind scrolling to a div there?)
[09:10:07] <johnkpaul> dennisbot: http://jsfiddle.net/DSFvd/7/
[09:10:16] <johnkpaul> you need your code to run after domready
[09:10:47] <johnkpaul> sorry dennisbot, http://jsfiddle.net/DSFvd/8/ not the other one
[09:10:49] <sunbeam> can anyone help me? why cant i access change elements within an iframe?
[09:11:17] <EHLOVader> sunbeam:  is it cross domain?
[09:11:25] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: You have to google dude.
[09:11:46] <EHLOVader> BillCriswell: maybe his google is on the fritz
[09:11:57] <EHLOVader> or he uses bing, poor soul...
[09:12:03] <aqeel> hi room

[09:12:41] <sunbeam> i use bing :)
[09:13:34] <dennisbot> johnkpaul: I tried it , and it's not document ready problem because it's not showing alert when I click button "participar"
[09:13:51] <johnkpaul> dennisbot: in the example that I sent you?
[09:13:52] <BinaryKitten> $('#someid').html(function() { return $(this).find('strong').html(); });

[09:14:36] <dennisbot> johnkpaul: when I click button "participar" it's not working, I saw that link, or just in my machine the problem :(
[09:14:58] <johnkpaul> :( it's hard to tell what your specific problem is without more information, dennisbot
[09:15:07] <johnkpaul> you are sure that you are adding the handler after domready?
[09:15:34] <dennisbot> yeah, it's working when I click the div with limegreen background but not the link it's weird
[09:15:48] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/BdrNd/1/
[09:16:04] <aqeel> throws loop at me why?
[09:16:05] <sunbeam> EHLOVader: but seriously any idea how come i cannot access things in an iframe?
[09:16:27] <dennisbot> johnkpaul: yeah, it's working when I click the div with limegreen background but not the link it's weird
[09:16:51] <johnkpaul> dennisbot: you mean the link that says "nombre"?
[09:17:13] <johnkpaul> dennisbot: you didn't add any click handlers to that element
[09:17:43] <dennisbot> no, the link that has classname "participar" and  it's a button due to the class but inside has a tag "a"
[09:18:00] <dennisbot> johnkpaul: no, the link that has classname "participar" and  it's a button due to the class but inside has a tag "a"

[09:19:07] <dennisbot> johnkpaul: :(, I'm not getting and alert that was I said it's weird
[09:19:22] <johnkpaul> hmm, dennisbot, that's very odd
[09:19:24] <johnkpaul> what browser/os?
[09:20:37] <dennisbot> johnkpaul: in chrome and firefox using win seven

[09:24:28] <johnkpaul> does that work for you
[09:24:43] <dennisbot> johnkpaul: no

[09:25:19] <BinaryKitten> $(item).html(function() { return $(this).text(); });
[09:25:37] <BillCriswell> BinaryKitten: That would remove all the tags, wouldn't it?
[09:25:43] <BinaryKitten> BillCriswell yep
[09:25:45] <BillCriswell> That was the first thing I thought of as well haha.
[09:26:01] <BinaryKitten> i love function passing to html etc

[09:26:57] <dennisbot> johnkpaul: so the button seem to be the problem
[09:27:14] <dblosevn> a tag can not be a decendant of button

[09:28:20] <sunbeam> ok guys i have a last question, when i have a jquery ui slider, and when I click the button and slide, the value of something i edit with change: function() only is applied when I release the mouse
[09:28:41] <sunbeam> is there a way that it can live change (so when i slide) and not only when i release the mouse button
[09:29:33] <dblosevn> sunbeam: because change doesnt fire till the value is finalized, migt try dragstart on the trigger
[09:30:07] <BillCriswell> You can slide: function(){ ... }

[09:33:11] <dennisbot> aqeel: not working in my code :(
[09:33:23] <dennisbot> aqeel: that's weird
[09:33:26] <aqeel> show me your code...jsfiddle it
[09:33:50] <aqeel> i think i know what is wrong
[09:36:11] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/ygvPS/.............this code is throwing me into loop of alert
[09:36:27] <BillCriswell> aqeel: Well I definitely won't be checking that out haha.
[09:36:34] <aqeel> how to get rid of the loop....and is not working as intented too...
[09:37:20] <aqeel> at least help me why the loop?
[09:38:50] <BillCriswell> aqeel: Are you trying to build your own responsive dealie?
[09:38:54] <aqeel> well i ould like to alert on screen less than 1024x768 and show 900 width pix at 1024x768 and full blown proper layout at greater than 1024x768
[09:39:24] <BillCriswell> aqeel: Have you looked into media queries?
[09:39:34] <aqeel> yes
[09:40:53] <dennisbot> thanks to all!
[09:41:01] <dennisbot> I know what was my problem xD!
[09:41:11] <dennisbot> a silly problem, I was loading with ajax my buttons
[09:41:27] <aqeel> but that is not dynamic....i want the user to change layout and hide page if less than 1024, if equal 1024 than show my content wih fixed width but if greater than 1024 ,  no restrictions....instead of creating multi pages and no alert with media queries
[09:41:28] <dennisbot> and the new ones didn't have attached the click event
[09:41:58] <aqeel> u r more than welcome
[09:42:23] <dennisbot> johnkpaul: thanks!
[09:42:32] <dennisbot> aqeel: and thanks!!
[09:42:57] <johnkpaul> dennisbot: np
[09:43:03] <aqeel> anytime
[09:44:49] <aqeel> so anyone who willing to give a helping hand
[09:45:59] <BillCriswell> aqeel: Just found something I coded up a bit ago that may be helpful. http://staging.intuitsolutions.net/mediaqueries/
[09:46:34] <BillCriswell> aqeel: The idea comes from Jeremy Keith: http://adactio.com/journal/5429/
[09:47:22] <BillCriswell> If you look in the console you'll see me calling the content propery on the body on resize.
[09:48:02] <aqeel> well thanks but i am not looking for browser resizing but rather resolution change
[09:48:30] <aqeel> u see if the moment you vhange the resolution the page must act accordingly...
[09:49:45] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/gsACG/
[09:49:51] <aqeel> this works perfectly...
[09:50:26] <aqeel> try changing resolution and coming to this fiddle again....you will get the alert
[09:51:03] <BillCriswell> aqeel: What problem are you trying to solve by doing this?
[09:52:21] <aqeel> so if any one changes resolution page gets hidden if lessthan 1024....if equal will show limited width proper size and if more than 1024....will be proper shown taking available view
[09:53:32] <aqeel> i am coding minimum for 1024 and not 800 so anyone less than 1024 will get an alert...
[09:55:34] <nezZario> ehhh
[09:55:41] <nezZario> how do I catch a form submission handler?
[09:56:12] <nezZario> err wait i'm reatarded.. $('#foo').submit(); isn't working because i put the submit button's id in there..
[09:56:13] <frantz> anyone have any good references for getting the height of one div and assigning as the height of another div dynamically?
[09:58:10] <BillCriswell> frantz: $('.div1').height(function(){ $('.div2').height($(this).height()); })
[09:58:23] <BillCriswell> Wait no that was dumb.
[09:58:27] <BillCriswell> Ignore that.
[09:59:04] <BillCriswell> var height = $('.div2').height(); $('div1').height( height );
[09:59:19] <aqeel> yup...that is correct
[09:59:41] <frantz> let me try it
[10:00:00] <BillCriswell> aqeel: What about someone at 1024x768  who has their browser window at  small size?
[10:00:21] <aqeel> that is ok..the content has min widtha nd will be seen
[10:00:46] <frantz> hmmmm didn't work for me
[10:00:55] <aqeel> so resizing browser basically have not effect
[10:01:23] <aqeel> it is the resolution i want to control
[10:01:46] <frantz> I mean it resized it a little bit, but its still not the same height
[10:02:14] <aqeel> frantz jsfiddle?
[10:02:20] <BillCriswell> frantz: How about outerHeight()?
[10:02:39] <BillCriswell> frantz: You may have different padding on the box maybe?
[10:02:53] <aqeel> that is why i requested the jsfiddle...
[10:03:02] <aqeel> could be many factors...
[10:03:20] <frantz> let me put it up there hang on
[10:04:50] <aqeel> so basically it is 3 case senario....if >1024,if = 1024, if < 1024
[10:05:02] <ypahnu> need help on spinner.change
[10:05:10] <ypahnu> someone?

[10:06:35] <frantz> blah, that is a mess!
[10:07:10] <frantz> I'm trying to get the .productBox and .productRtSB to be the same height
[10:07:13] <BillCriswell> frantz: Yeah, creating a fiddle can be tricky.
[10:07:30] <frantz> the .productRtSB needs to adjust to the height of the .productBox
[10:07:32] <frantz> if that makes sense
[10:08:07] <vedic> I am using jquery autocomplete plugin as part of UI. I have not so trivial requirement. The auto complete data is list of city/country names. If a user enters a city/country name and is not part of the list, it should show "World" as the fallback option in the list of names. Eg: If I enter 'Ja' then it will show Japan, Jakarta etc in the drop down list and if I continue 'Ja' as 'Jambia' and this city is not in the list then it should show "world" as the last opti
[10:10:09] <aqeel> frantz you have margin setup...
[10:10:36] <frantz> ?
[10:11:27] <aqeel> also you are saying....height of .productRtSB to be 100%
[10:11:39] <aqeel> in your css
[10:12:02] <frantz> removed.
[10:12:27] <frantz> ... hmm
[10:12:40] <mourad> Unlimited International calls. is 100% free!
[10:12:40] <mourad> http://free-unlimited-international-calls.tk/
[10:12:41] <mourad> that you must download and install
[10:13:38] <aqeel> my advice never to use......position and float together.....others have theirs ......
[10:13:52] <BillCriswell> frantz: Here is a vanilla example of it: http://jsfiddle.net/dhW5A/
[10:14:32] <BillCriswell> The .height( height ) way works as well but I did the CSS way to mess around.
[10:14:35] <Gho5t> hey y'all I'm having a philosophical discussion with a college. we are currently styling buttons by creating a jquery plugin that handles all this for element with a class of .button. He is saying that he thinks using css pseudo selectors such as :before and :after are easier to use and more performant? any thoughts?
[10:16:06] <aqeel> if you float an element it will remove all available spaces surrounding that element....thus there is no purpose of height......i would change it with position and make use of display.....inline-block/block
[10:16:20] <frantz> I must be implementing it wrong, but when I try to use that method it breaks my tabs
[10:16:31] <frantz> i'll try taht
[10:19:26] <frantz> is there a reason why doing the var = height thing might break ui tabs?
[10:20:32] <aqeel> it might have implimented already for the tabs could be one reason...
[10:20:38] <aqeel> as you are reapplying it
[10:21:06] <aqeel> try to do within the function and not as global

[10:31:05] <kdridi> hi
[10:31:19] <BillCriswell> Those timer functions always mess with my brain for some reason.
[10:31:21] <kdridi> in order to debug a javascript i need to do some ajax request on a remote domain using rails
[10:31:28] <kdridi> i have the error : [Origin http://localhost:3000 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.]
[10:31:34] <kdridi> even if i configured https://gist.github.com/3960011
[10:31:37] <kdridi> nay ideas ?
[10:32:20] <kdridi> do i have to configure something on the browser or what ?
[10:32:32] <CodesStuff> Hmm
[10:32:41] <CodesStuff> So you've set up your box to allow JSONP?
[10:32:43] <gnarf> kdridi: see ?sop
[10:32:44] <bot-t> kdridi, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[10:33:04] <gnarf> even with CORS - its kinda a pain

[10:33:38] <kdridi> :)
[10:33:47] <CodesStuff> That's funny.  I've already written a JS class
[10:33:54] <CodesStuff> to mimick all of Instagram's private API
[10:33:55] <CodesStuff> :P
[10:34:15] <CodesStuff> I'm assuming you're using the public API, correct?
[10:34:21] <CodesStuff> (api.instagram.com/*)
[10:34:22] <kdridi> yes
[10:34:35] <CodesStuff> Alright, well they allow JSONP for some of their calls
[10:34:36] <kdridi> i try to access https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/self/feed
[10:35:27] <CodesStuff> I don't think they've allowed JSONP for that yet, have they?
[10:35:38] <CodesStuff> If so, try &callback=your_function
[10:35:54] <kdridi> hum...
[10:36:01] <vedic> I am using jquery autocomplete plugin as part of UI. I have not so trivial requirement. The auto complete data is list of city/country names.

[10:36:30] <CodesStuff> tl;dr;
[10:36:37] <kdridi> CodesStuff, but that's not what i need, i just want to disabled the security check from the browser
[10:37:22] <CodesStuff> kdridi: That's all good and well, however Instagram would need to set those origin policies - not you.
[10:37:34] <CodesStuff> You're trying to access data on THEIR site, not vice-versa.
[10:37:53] <CodesStuff> Now what I'd suggest you do is just proxy it (like you're supposed to :P)
[10:38:24] <CodesStuff> Javascript -> backend (PHP, RoR, Python, etc) -> Instagram -> Backend again -> Javascript (client)
[10:38:54] <CodesStuff> Also read up on the same-origin policy as gnarf said above :P
[10:39:18] <kdridi> you mean that the headers i trying to set (ike "Access-Control-Allow-Origin") must be sent by the remote request URL not by my local http://localhost:3000/index.html answer ?
[10:40:13] <CodesStuff> Correct. How would it make sense if the site trying to pull data from a remote site via the client was in control of that?
[10:40:30] <CodesStuff> I mean, I'd be pulling cookies from Facebook on my site if it were possible :P
[10:40:55] <kdridi> hum, i understand ...
[10:41:49] <amcsi> Hey

[10:42:25] <CodesStuff> kdridi: One think I could suggest is appending the call as a script tag to the DOM.
[10:42:45] <kdridi> CodesStuff, thank for pointing out this problem, otherwise i would spend hours finding a solution :)
[10:43:05] <CodesStuff> No problem
[10:43:31] <kdridi> CodesStuff, i'll do the standard call by using the backend first
[10:43:35] <CodesStuff> In case I'm wrong, kdridi, try doing <script src="https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/1574083/?access_token=ACCESS-TOKEN&callback=wee"></script>
[10:43:54] <CodesStuff> then define "wee" as a function above it and see if it does anything
[10:44:04] <kdridi> i try
[10:44:15] <CodesStuff> well, see if "wee = { response_from_instagram }" is in the repsonse

[11:35:10] <timwis> Hey guys, it looks like my jsonp $.ajax() is occasionally giving me this error - any idea what could cause it? Uncaught TypeError: Property 'jQuery171009043319057673216_1351276072843' of object [object Window] is not a function
[11:35:29] <timwis> I know that string is the callback function name, but why would it not exist? And why would it only sporadically occur?
[11:36:21] <timwis> Also, I see in the network tab that a response was properly returned
[11:37:10] <CodesStuff> timwis: that "jQuery171009043319057673216_1351276072843" is the callback function
[11:37:22] <CodesStuff> it looks like it isn't properly defined in the DOM
[11:37:47] <timwis> CodesStuff: But isn't that function created by jQuery?

[11:41:40] <timwis> CodesStuff: I see the response in the network tab. also, that error is produced by the response suceeding and trying to execute that function
[11:41:57] <CodesStuff> Odd. I've got no idea then =\
[11:42:15] <timwis> yeah, it's strange. well, thanks anyway

[11:45:40] <Hookah> something like that, but the actual proble rises from the url i give the .getJSON, and with the /echo/json/ of jsfiddle, it works
[11:47:43] <Hookah> the annoying part is, that it send the right http get request (i watch the httpd logs)
[11:47:51] <Hookah> and it gets the right answer like i expect it to
[11:47:56] <Hookah> but it wont execute the callback function
[11:50:46] <Hookah> ryanneufeld?
[11:51:48] <Klevre> MiracleBlue, you still here?
[11:52:12] <blast_hardcheese> Could someone please explain this? I thought javascript functions were first-class objects, no special syntax or anything: http://blast.hardchee.se/~/files/2012-10-26/wth.png
[11:53:17] <blast_hardcheese> This is jquery 1.7.2 with jquery-ui 1.9.0
[11:53:45] <blast_hardcheese> album_cover is a jquery-ui widget that has previously been applied to foo
[11:53:47] <gnarf> blast_hardcheese: the context of the call is different
[11:54:00] <firstclassfunc> When I call .html() on some element  it returns <input type="text" {{inputAttr}}=""> instead of <input type="text" {{inputAttr}}>
[11:54:03] <gnarf> blast_hardcheese: foo["bar"]( ) is called on "foo"
[11:54:07] <firstclassfunc> how can I change that? .text() doesnt work either
[11:54:15] <Hookah> anyone?
[11:54:20] <gnarf> blast_hardcheese: a() is called in the "global" context (window)
[11:54:35] <gnarf> blast_hardcheese: you can do a.call( foo, 'customize' )
[11:54:35] <blast_hardcheese> gnarf: I see
[11:55:15] <blast_hardcheese> I was hoping to be able to reduce the call down to one function instead of having to lug around components
[11:55:26] <gnarf> blast_hardcheese: or even a = $.proxy( foo, bar ) -- http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[11:55:29] <blast_hardcheese> I guess I could close around it
[11:55:39] <ryanneufeld> Hookah: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/WC9Ry/1/
[11:55:46] <blast_hardcheese> Ah, perfect. Proxy is exactly what I need.
[11:55:53] <blast_hardcheese> gnarf: You rock, thank you.
[11:56:36] <embersoaker> $('.test').attr('title', 'test error'); should set the title attribute on that element but it is not being set. I know my selector is correct because a line below it sets the alt text
[11:56:47] <ryanneufeld> Hookah: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/WC9Ry/2/
[11:58:15] <Hookah> ryanneufeld should i test that?
[11:58:44] <ryanneufeld> might not be a bad idea
[11:58:54] <Hookah> aight, one moment then ;p
[12:01:09] <mikeumus> Hey Gang, I'm using routie for hash routing but am wondering a way for it to check the url hash before rendering the page to determine what to render exactly.
[12:01:45] <mikeumus> So far just using routing isn't doing that: http://projects.jga.me/routie/
[12:03:04] <Hookah> ryanneufeld it doesn't get to it..
[12:03:16] <Sabres> hey - can anyone look at this simple paste and tell me why the div isn't being displayed? - http://jsfiddle.net/bLT3j/
[12:03:57] <BLeg> I'm using $.getScript to load a script after my page has loaded. The script doesn't provide functionality, but instead places an ad on the page. Is there a way I can use getScript on a specific div? (i.e to place the ad where I want it?) instead of just loading it into page?
[12:04:47] <Hookah> ryanneufeld i mean, the console.log doesn't do anything
[12:04:52] <mikeumus> Sabres: your wanting the drop down to slide down?
[12:04:56] <Hookah> but i added alertS() all around to see where it reaches
[12:04:59] <Hookah> it gets to the fail()
[12:05:30] <mikeumus> Sabres: you'll need a statement somewhere that changes the css on special div to display the div
[12:05:34] <Sabres> mikeumus: i want the dropdown <option 1> to lead to a div below it do display
[12:05:47] <mikeumus> ok
[12:06:17] <Hookah> ryanneufeld also, if i manually enter
[12:06:17] <Hookah> http://127.0.0.1/clients.php?do=add_client&validate=1&legacyid=&pname=&lname=&idnum=&telnum=&cellnum=&faxnum=&email=%20HTTP/1.1%22%20200%20368%20%22http://127.0.0.1/clients.php
[12:06:34] <Hookah> (ya, the end is lame, disregard it)
[12:06:36] <Hookah> i get  ["legacyid","pname","lname","idnum","telnum","cellnum","faxnum","email"]
[12:06:47] <Hookah> from the script, so that means jquery is getting a proper response...
[12:07:07] <Sabres> mikeumus: any suggestions?
[12:07:13] <mikeumus> I'm checking out it
[12:07:28] <Sabres> k thanks
[12:07:47] <mikeumus> Sabres: looks like slideDown doesn't actually change the css from display none
[12:08:57] <mikeumus> Sabres: I suggest jsut mapping out your css changes with eh animate function
[12:09:01] <mikeumus> the*
[12:09:40] <mikeumus> or to use slidedown without setting display:none
[12:10:16] <BLeg> anyone know anything about my getScript question?
[12:10:45] <Hookah> ryanneufeld?
[12:11:26] <mikeumus> Sabres: you'll notice that selecting the first SELECT ME drop down in firebug or chrome inspector doesn't change special div away from display:none;
[12:12:05] <mikeumus> Sabres: using alert to see if the slidedown function is firing as well may be a good idea. I've never used that one personally.
[12:12:45] <Blaster> hey is there a one liner to get a siblings child?   <li><b></b><h2><small>Hello World</small></li>    $('b').....
[12:12:53] <Blaster> looking to get to <small>
[12:13:15] <mikeumus> Anyone have any techniques on rendering a page based on the url hash? I'm trying to use routie to do this with no luck so far: if(window.location.hash ===''){     routie('inkwhy-dashboard'); }   var box14 = $('#box1,#box2,#box3,#box4'); var box124 = $('#box1,#box2,#box4'); var box24 = $('#box2,#box4'); var box234 = $('#box2, #box3, #box4');                   // click to new AdInk Dashboard function adinkDashboard(){          box14.
[12:13:27] <mikeumus> opps
[12:13:43] <mikeumus> i meant: http://projects.jga.me/routie/
[12:16:13] <Sabres> mikeumus: I got the div to appear now
[12:16:41] <Sabres> can you see about trying to get the div to disappear when i change the select satement again? http://jsfiddle.net/bLT3j/1/
[12:18:18] <mikeumus> Sabres: not the most elegant mayby but another if statement seeing what the val is and calling a function to disappear the div
[12:18:27] <mikeumus> maybe*
[12:19:23] <mikeumus> Sabres: so somehting like if(this.val !=1346){special.hide()};
[12:21:18] <fission6> i need to make api calls from a 3rd party site on the client side, is there a way i can do this, ie cross domain requests?
[12:24:22] <BLeg> again, I'm using $.getScript to load a script after my page has loaded. The script doesn't provide functionality, but instead places an ad on the page. Is there a way I can use getScript on a specific div? (i.e to place the ad where I want it?) instead of just loading it into page?
[12:28:04] <BillCriswell> BLeg: How about $('.ad').append('<script src="foo.js"></script>'); ?
[12:28:58] <BillCriswell> Assuming the ad shows up where the script tag is placed?
[12:29:46] <BLeg> BillCriswell: It didn't work. Apparently external javascript files can't be loaded after the page has rendered
[12:30:03] <BLeg> i haven't found a way outside of $.getScript()
[12:30:30] <TelFiRE> Why doesn't this work? if($this.not(':animated'))  ($this is a var of $(this))
[12:31:59] <BLeg> TelFiRE: I've never seen $this be successful. Try $(this)
[12:32:17] <TelFiRE> it works fine in the rest of my code and in hundreds of plugins
[12:32:28] <TelFiRE> it's poor practice to use $(this) over and over again
[12:32:34] <BillCriswell> BLeg: $this is usually just referencing $(this)
[12:33:12] <BillCriswell> BLeg: What is in your js file?
[12:34:20] <BLeg> BillCriswell: It's not mine. It's from a 3rd party that runs ads
[12:34:47] <ajpiano> TelFiRE: if ( !$this.is(":animated") ) or if ( !$this.not(":animated").length  ) { }
[12:35:01] <BLeg> it wouldn't be a problem if the js file just had a generate function to load the ad, but it's immediately loaded when the script is called
[12:35:02] <ajpiano> TelFiRE: all jQuery collections, including the one returned from .not, are truth
[12:35:04] <ajpiano> truthy
[12:35:08] <fission6> is their a standard cross domain approach with jquery
[12:36:52] <BillCriswell> BLeg: But basically these ads load us where the JS is placed?
[12:37:16] <TelFiRE> lol truthiness eh
[12:37:31] <BLeg> using $.getScript() they don't. They just get added to the bottom of my markup
[12:38:03] <BillCriswell> BLeg: but if you just put the script tags where you want it to appear it just appears there?
[12:38:09] <BLeg> yes
[12:38:15] <BLeg> they'll load where the JS is placed on page refresh, yeah. But I'm actually loading them via AJAX at the end of the day.
[12:39:57] <BLeg> BillCriswell: and with my AJAX output, I'm loading divs etc... etc.. and this one script tag, but it doesn't load because it's loaded after the page has been loaded and someone uses the ajax functionality
[12:42:11] <fission6> so i guess thats a no
[12:42:48] <BLeg> fission6: what kind of api calls
[12:44:10] <fission6> BLeg: get and post calls with json response to a 3rd party
[12:45:26] <BLeg> fission6: you just want to GET/POST to another domain?
[12:46:11] <BillCriswell> BLeg: Not sure hwo to handle that.
[12:47:02] <BillCriswell> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/610995/jquery-cant-append-script-element might help though.
[12:47:52] <BLeg> BillCriswell: Yeah, I'm afraid to look because I refuse to accept that javascript can be just completely missing this functionality.
[12:48:25] <fission6> BLeg: yeah, i am trying to create a pure client side appplication, but most of the info is coming from a 3rd party api
[12:49:39] <BLeg> fission6: well you'd have to look at their API.
[12:49:52] <BLeg> fission6: have a look at these: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/ and http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[12:50:23] <fission6> BLeg: you aren't really helping address teh cross doman issue
[12:50:29] <fission6> thats my concern
[12:51:10] <BillCriswell> BLeg: $('.ad').append( $('<script/>').attr({src: 'hi.js'}) ); appears to work where $('.ad').append('<script src="hi.js"></script>'); does not.
[12:51:53] <BLeg> fission6: what do you mean cross domain? I'm reading that mysite.com posting data to facebook.com
[12:52:13] <BLeg> BillCriswell: I'll give that a shot right now
[12:52:34] <fission6> yea i mean i have a pure js application served from mysite.com it needs to make get and post requests to an api behind anothersite.com
[12:52:43] <fission6> won't i run into cross domain ajax issues
[12:54:41] <TelFiRE> Hmm well not :animating is causing some extreme weirdness. Is there a better approach to causing my rollover effect which calls two functions which are basically just animations, to not repeat the animation a million times if you repeatedly hover during the animation?
[12:55:22] <BLeg> fission6: You haven't tried?
[12:56:08] <fission6> no, are you familar with cross domain browser issues?
[12:56:17] <fission6> do you understand what i am hinting at
[12:56:26] <BLeg> I have no idea what you mean by cross-domain in this case, no
[12:56:38] <BLeg> fission6: If it's an API then no. I mean, these things are specifically designed to work the way you're describing. You just call them. The API itself will define permissions and security restrictions that you'll have to adhere to...
[12:57:29] <fission6> i dont think you understand the question or you are behind on same origin policy, i think ill wait for someone else to respond
[12:59:57] <eian> Is there an easier way to move between different user interfaces?: http://pastebin.com/eNz4KNCk
[13:00:26] <BLeg> fission6: You can wait all you want, but two things: You haven't described the problem whatsoever. You're calling an API that someone somewhere has defined. Just call the API. Secondly: You haven't explained what cross-domain issues you're talking about. You haven't even tried to fix the problem before asking about it.
[13:00:54] <fission6> BLeg: you don't udnerstand its a fundemental / common problem cross domain ajax calls
[13:01:11] <fission6> i think you are just not aware of it
[13:01:41] <BLeg> fission6: That's fine. I mean it's no skin off my nose. You wait.
[13:01:52] <BLeg> eian: Are you trying to create a tab-like interface?
[13:01:59] <eian> BLeg: yeah
[13:02:15] <eian> but without tabs...heh
[13:02:47] <eian> BLeg, the div's are forms that need to be filled out
[13:02:59] <BLeg> eian: Ha, well, you could do it like that. The only thing you'll want to watch for is if you're loading the content in the tabs dynamically via something like a CMS
[13:03:02] <eian> so I just swap out the "main" view al lthe time
[13:03:30] <eian> right
[13:03:40] <eian> alright, I guess I'll stick with it then
[13:03:48] <eian> thanks
[13:04:06] <BLeg> eian: Yeah, if it's simple like that you can't get much easier than a one-line call :D
[13:27:37] <TelFiRE> Hey guys. My LIs seem to have a mind of their own, migrating toward the bottom right if you hover over them too fast. Any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/zZJHD/

[13:51:50] <belak> Hi, I was just wondering if there was a better way to do this... http://pastie.org/5120714
[13:52:10] <belak> The infinite recursion doesn't sit well with me...
[13:54:23] <lz> belak, what are you trying to accomplish?
[13:56:59] <TelFiRE> Any ideas why mousing over these LIs repeatedly will cause them to migrade down and to the right? http://jsfiddle.net/zZJHD/1/
[13:58:54] <Dave_Stein> belak: Why does that count as recursion? or do you just mean copy-pasting repeatedly?
[13:59:05] <razzi> belak maybe a gif..
[14:01:03] <razzi> Dave_Stein, it's a recursion technically, just one without a return value
[14:02:15] <Dave_Stein> razzi: i suppose you're right - i just usually think of recursion as calling own function again and again from within
[14:02:29] <shodan45> re: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-buttons when using Array, what are the "attributes, properties, and event handlers"?

[14:48:35] <dblosevn> $('#video1').prop('currentTime', 120); maybe?
[14:49:50] <Melsom> Ofcourse, it's as easy as reading the error message.. :/
[14:49:59] <Melsom> $("#video1").currentTime = 120; ofcourse.

[14:50:31] <dblosevn> np
[14:51:22] <TelFiRE> Maybe if instead of posting example code I simply ask a question I'll have better luck. How do you make a rollover effect in jQuery?!
[14:54:53] <ericw> why jquery?
[14:54:59] <ericw> and what effect TelFiRE
[14:55:08] <ericw> you have to have an effect in mind
[14:55:16] <TelFiRE> ericw: here is my test case: http://jsfiddle.net/zZJHD/2/
[14:55:50] <TelFiRE> ericw: my problem is that, though these work perfectly if I remove the bits involving the "rolling" class, right now if you roll over it too fast it moves towards the bottom right slowly
[14:56:22] <TelFiRE> it seems like my function makeBig is being called a second time even though it explicitly says ONLY run if it doesn't have "rolling" class
[14:56:23] <ericw> you can do this with css
[14:56:29] <TelFiRE> no
[14:56:37] <ericw> why not?
[14:56:47] <TelFiRE> several reasons
[14:56:54] <TelFiRE> first and foremost, IE does not support css3
[14:57:18] <ericw> do you still develop for IE?
[14:57:30] <TelFiRE> second, I am doing other jQuery animation on these same lis, and if the animation properties are on it, it totally hoses that animation and makes it all jumpy
[14:57:32] <ericw> lol, you can easily design it to be effective in IE
[14:57:41] <ericw> the only thing you'll be missing is the transition
[14:57:49] <TelFiRE> It's not an option.
[14:57:52] <ericw> it'll just instantly be enlarged on hover instead of slowly transitioning
[14:58:12] <TelFiRE> Unacceptable.
[14:58:21] <TelFiRE> and doesn't address the other problem
[14:58:25] <TelFiRE> please, I don't want a workaround
[14:58:30] <TelFiRE> I want to know why this straightforward jquery is not working
[14:59:03] <ericw> k, well it's beer friday here in the office so i'll ttyl.
[14:59:41] <TelFiRE> why do people waste my time like that
[15:01:23] <hye> I have a <div> and want to make it a popup modalbox to alert the user of an error... how can I do this without sending the user to another page?

[15:16:20] <Zzaichik> http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[15:16:20] <hye> because two elements can have the same ID
[15:16:40] <hye> change the ID to  class="abc"  and do a class selector
[16:02:20] <hugo_moss> im appending a span element within a div using the .append() function. for some reason the span has 0 opacity and is not showing up. the div has a list and after it the span, but the span is 0 opacity
[16:05:57] <Hookah> hey, i have $(':input[type="text"]')
[16:06:18] <Hookah> how do i only select those inputs that match that, and only the ones that are inside form#lol
[16:07:51] <shoky> Hookah: $('form#lol :input[type="text"]')
[16:22:55] <hugo_moss> im appending a span element within a div using the .append() function. for some reason the span has 0 opacity and is not showing up. the div has a list and after it the span, but the span is 0 opacity
[16:26:58] <sunbeam> when i edit an input field with a slider, the script doesn't detect a "change"
[16:27:06] <sunbeam> but when i manually change the input field value, it does
[16:27:11] <sunbeam> any idea how come or what i should trigger?
[16:31:29] <ficho> hi all
[16:31:50] <ficho> Anyone available to help with a :header selector?
[16:42:45] <Guest94998> is there something like instanceof in jquery
[16:43:25] <Guest94998> or a way identify the type of an intem
[16:43:27] <Guest94998> item
[16:43:29] <Guest94998> *
[16:47:56] <sunbeam> there is document.ready for when a document is finished, but what if i also want to catch a (later loaded) iframe content?
[16:48:01] <masch> Guest94998: there is a instanceof in JavaScript, what exactly do you want to test?
[16:49:02] <Guest94998> I wanna know what kind of DOM I'm handling to treat it in the way it is supposed
[16:49:25] <masch> sunbeam: i'm not an expert but does iframeelement.on('ready' or 'load' work?
[16:49:48] <HarryPitfall> 'load' works
[16:49:48] <sunbeam> sec
[16:50:21] <HarryPitfall> I just want to point that you get a trigger 'for free' just after the document finishes load
[16:50:30] <HarryPitfall> even for about:blank or sourceless iframe
[16:51:05] <Guest94998> I'll try to explain it as best I could
[16:51:54] <masch> Guest94998: are you looking for something like element.tagName ?
[16:51:59] <sunbeam> masch: neither
[16:52:55] <Guest94998> I'm trying to handle many DOM and objects in a kind of pop up form so when I finished capturind data and creating/setting data I got to "save" them in a special way that depdns of their DOM type or the type of object
[16:53:30] <sunbeam> masch: nvm
[16:53:32] <sunbeam> it works
[16:53:52] <sunbeam> I need to detect when a certain #div element is ready and loaded on page
[16:53:56] <sunbeam> how can i detect this best?
[16:54:37] <masch> shouldnt all divs be "ready and loaded" when document#ready is fired?
[16:54:53] <Guest94998> sunbeam isnt it like $('#div).ready(function(){});
[16:54:56] <Guest94998> ?
[16:55:17] <sunbeam> yea i tried
[16:56:03] <masch> Guest94998: so you want to check if each of your object is a DOMElement (ele instanceof Element), and if yes, you can check the .tagName what kind of DomElement it is.
[16:56:35] <Guest94998> masch: yes, something like that
[16:57:04] <masch> sunbeam: i don't think that divs or other html element emit ready object. Only elements that actually load content (script, link, img, ..) may emit 'load' (AFAIK)
[16:57:19] <Guest94998> sunbeam: did it work?
[16:58:29] <masch> Guest94998: there you got anything you need. $(this).forEach(function(ele) { if(ele instanceof Element) { handleDomElement(ele); } else { handleOtherStuff(ele); } })
[16:59:03] <masch> just a ugly example ;)
[16:59:24] <sunbeam> masch: you're right i found it
[16:59:29] <sunbeam> but there is an issue with loading
[16:59:34] <sunbeam> for some reason this works:
[16:59:40] <Guest94998> thanks masch
[16:59:46] <Guest94998> see u guys thanks
[16:59:50] <sunbeam> alert("test"); $j("iframe").contents().find("#something").css("height", "100px");
[16:59:54] <sunbeam> and this doesnt:
[16:59:57] <sunbeam> $j("iframe").contents().find("#something").css("height", "100px");
[17:00:01] <sunbeam> without the alert()
[17:00:03] <sunbeam> what does this mean?
[17:00:11] <sunbeam> probably that there needs to be some delay right?
[17:00:33] <masch> yes
[17:01:07] <sunbeam> how can i best do this?
[17:01:55] <ficho> guys how can i select all the header elements in a div but not directly in them (2 levels down) but not the h1s? :)
[17:01:55] <tw2113> ?delay > sunbeam
[17:01:59] <bot-t> tw2113, Couldn't find "delay > sunbeam" in jQuery Docs.
[17:02:04] <tw2113> bah
[17:02:08] <tw2113> ?delay @ sunbeam
[17:02:08] <bot-t> sunbeam, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[17:02:22] <ficho> $(":header div#name.not(h1)).(); ?
[17:02:56] <sunbeam> thanks
[17:03:14] <masch> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5788499/jquery-iframe-load-event
[17:04:12] <sunbeam> masch: thanks, better solution
[17:04:16] <sunbeam> but i cannot change the iframe document
[17:04:35] <masch> ficho: $("div#name :header:not(h1)") should do it, if i got your problem right
[17:04:46] <masch> sunbeam: okay, then thats not possible
[17:04:51] <masch> iframes are tricky :/
[17:04:56] <ficho> thanks masch trying it now!
[17:05:38] <TrentonDAdams> The jquery site claims it works in chrome, but it doesn't appear to, any ideas?  I have very simple jQuery('selector').click(function (event) {alert('hello')}); and it does nothing
[17:06:22] <masch> TrentonDAdams: i can tell you that jQuery works wonderfull in chrome ;)
[17:06:40] <masch> TrentonDAdams: so your problem might be somewhere else
[17:07:00] <TrentonDAdams> masch: Okay, but where would I look?  The chrome developer thing doesn't give me any errors or anything.
[17:07:24] <masch> TrentonDAdams: are you sure your selector select anything?
[17:07:27] <ficho> masch: thanks a million! it worked!
[17:07:33] <masch> ficho: np
[17:07:46] <TrentonDAdams> masch: It works perfectly in IE and firefox, so yep
[17:08:19] <TrentonDAdams> And, in fact, I run jash bookmarklet and it works, except the click event doesn't fire after binding it
[17:08:28] <masch> console.log(jQuery('your selector').length);
[17:08:42] <masch> oh, okay sry didnt read
[17:09:06] <sunbeam> masch: i dont get it, where should i use .delay? $("iframe").contents().find("#something").css("height", "100px");
[17:09:37] <masch> sunbeam: afaik delay only delays animations
[17:09:42] <TrentonDAdams> alert(jQuery('#select-other').length); returns '1'
[17:10:00] <masch> sunbeam: so you might want to use setTimeout for this..
[17:10:09] <TrentonDAdams> It's just odd, cause I'm not doing anything special, just binding a click event, which doesn't call my code.
[17:10:14] <masch> TrentonDAdams: is your test document public reachable?
[17:11:09] <masch> because "works in ie but not in chrome" sounds really odd..
[17:11:24] <TrentonDAdams> masch: does this look okay?       jQuery(document).ready(function() {});  Or is the use of 'document' a non-standard?
[17:11:33] <sunbeam> masch: ah ofc
[17:11:56] <masch> nope, looks correct but you can use jQuery(function() { }); for that, too. its a shortcut
[17:11:58] <TrentonDAdams> masch: No, not public cause it's all embedded.
[17:12:14] <TrentonDAdams> masch: It's all over the net that stuff works in IE and firefox, but not chrome, with jQuery
[17:12:24] <masch> O.o
[17:12:28] <sunbeam> masch: really strange
[17:12:31] <sunbeam> just trued timeOut
[17:12:34] <sunbeam> setTimeOut
[17:12:36] <sunbeam> but doesnt work
[17:13:33] <masch> sunbeam: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.setTimeout
[17:14:02] <masch> TrentonDAdams: i never really hit anything that dont works in chrome with jquery and i'm pretty sure that click handlers work
[17:14:10] <TrentonDAdams> masch: it appears to be event.preventDefault() that is not working, just a sec.
[17:14:16] <masch> TrentonDAdams: can u try .bind('click', function.. pls ?
[17:14:29] <JonnyGreen> is it a good option to upload files with iframes?
[17:15:16] <TrentonDAdams> masch: Hmm, I narrowed it down to not working after a custom function call. I'm crazy, it's something in my non-jquery code somewhere.  I'm going to have to figure out what.
[17:15:18] <masch> JonnyGreen: if you want "ajax file uploads" in legacy browser, i dont know a way around it
[17:15:21] <TrentonDAdams> Sorry for wasting time. :()
[17:15:24] <TrentonDAdams> :(
[17:15:36] <advorak> http://pastie.org/5121448 -- When the first block of code is run, all 3 checkboxes are checked, when I run the second block only the last checkbox is checked ..  What I want is, in the second, for all checkboxes to be checked .. but what is going on to disable the first two checkboxes from being checked?
[17:15:36] <masch> TrentonDAdams: np, happens ;)
[17:15:52] <JonnyGreen> masch:  there are some pluggins also
[17:15:55] <advorak> is the code running too fast? :-P or what is going on? :-)
[17:16:04] <TrentonDAdams> masch: damn chrome doesn't spit anything out that, ahhhhhhh
[17:17:45] <masch> JonnyGreen: but i think they dont do anything different because (afaik) leacy browser dont support the XHR api needed for ajax file uploads
[17:18:01] <masch> JonnyGreen: but i'm not really an expert in that region..
[17:18:15] <dennisbot> see ya
[17:18:28] <dennisbot> it's time to go home
[17:18:31] <JonnyGreen> ok
[17:18:31] <dennisbot> see you tomorrow
[17:20:57] <masch> so i confused everyone far enough? fine :D
[17:29:08] <TrentonDAdams> masch: It was a miss-use of console logging that caused it.  I copied that off some site.
[17:29:21] <masch> ok
[17:29:36] <TrentonDAdams> apparently, in the call to console.log.apply, you must pass 'console' as the first parameter.  I don't understand why though. :(
[17:30:30] <shoky> the first argument to apply is the 'this' context
[17:30:37] <shoky> same with .bind and .call
[17:31:20] <masch> exactly, and console.log likes his this!
[17:34:16] <TrentonDAdams> masch: holy crap Chrome console errors are confusing.
[17:35:09] <TrentonDAdams> firefox just let me click directly to where my problem was, and I'd just go "oh, yeah, DUH, you stupid!" hehe
[17:35:23] <TrentonDAdams> Well, not firefox, the developer toolbar. :P
[17:35:57] <TrentonDAdams> Anyhow, thanks for listening. ttyl

[19:12:52] <hugo_moss> hi im fading in text within a div box with a 1 pixel border, when i fade the text in, the text slowly visibly appears, but starts from outside the border, how can i restrict it to the viewport of the box?
[19:43:27] <defaultro> hey guys, the app that was given to us doesn't work in Chrome. It only works in Firefox. I would like to troubleshoot it. Not sure if it's modal window. Where do I start troubleshooting?
[19:48:55] <ecsos> chromes developer tools
[19:50:29] <defaultro> k
[20:01:41] <defaultro> i can see in Console when I click the object, it calls our form.js but it doesn't show the form
[20:02:33] <defaultro> does chrome also support breakpoints?
[20:03:10] <defaultro> it does, I see it :) color blue
[20:05:02] <defaultro> wow, Chrome Dev Tools is way better than Firebug :)
[20:07:41] <tw2113> firebug has breakpoints
[20:07:55] <defaultro> yup
[20:08:01] <defaultro> I'm new to CHrome
[20:08:12] <tw2113> don't use firebug for chrome
[20:08:16] <defaultro> I was saying that I found the breakpoints in Chrome
[20:08:17] <tw2113> just use the native tools
[20:08:23] <defaultro> yup
[20:08:30] <defaultro> i like it. it's neat
[20:17:05] <fission61> $.getJSON('http://somedomain.com/ad-profile?callback=?',function(data) {console.log("hey");}); i am doing this and getting a response back, but chrome keeps throwing out an error about a ":" i think its trying to parse the jsonp
[20:19:45] <fission61> its like its not being wrapped in the callback
[20:19:45] <defaultro> hmmm. it doesn't enter this function when I am using Chrome. The highlight just steps on this code and jumps to the next function,      var modifyForm = function(f) { .......
[20:20:10] <defaultro> in Firebug in Firegox, it does stop at the breakpoint inside that function
[20:20:46] <defaultro> so why when in Chrome, it doesn't stop at the breakpoint inside that function? I did the same steps
[20:22:01] <tw2113> should be able to step into it
[20:22:24] <defaultro> not sure why it doesn't when using Chrome
[20:22:34] <fission61> is their a common way to handle this?
[20:22:43] <defaultro> the team that handled this code to us told us that they only supported Firefox
[20:23:11] <defaultro> they're going to troubleshoot Chrome next year. I can't wait that long
[20:23:31] <defaultro> it's really weird that it doesn't go inside the function :(
[20:24:17] <tw2113> try clicking the down arrow on the right
[20:24:22] <defaultro> are there parts in chrome dev tools that will tell me why it didn't go inside or why it was failing?
[20:24:38] <defaultro> tw2113, is that for me?
[20:24:51] <defaultro> is that the arrow with dot?
[20:24:51] <tw2113> i see 5 buttons on the right in chrome dev tools, sources tab
[20:24:59] <tw2113> yes, the down arrow with the dot
[20:25:06] <defaultro> i'll try
[20:25:20] <tw2113> tool tip says "step into next function call"
[20:25:27] <defaultro> it didn't :(
[20:26:05] <defaultro> however, the modifyform now when I hover the mouse, it shows the yellow window
[20:26:13] <defaultro> the variable modifyform
[20:26:36] <defaultro> it's the whole function I wrote
[20:26:44] <tw2113> i have no idea what you're seeing
[20:27:00] <defaultro> var modifyform = function(f) { ............}
[20:27:51] <tw2113> http://d.pr/i/6vNz
[20:28:02] <tw2113> just to be sure
[20:28:08] <defaultro> yes
[20:28:10] <defaultro> that's the one
[20:28:12] <defaultro> or F11
[20:28:17] <tw2113> pause, step over, step into, step out of
[20:28:33] <tw2113> what you see below that in the breakpoints/scope vars/etc
[20:28:35] <tw2113> is up to your code
[20:29:29] <defaultro> i did the same steps in Firefox. Placed the same breakpoints too. In Firebug, it goes inside which is what I was expecting. In chrome, similar to what I said above, it doesn't go inside
[20:30:05] <defaultro> don't know where in chrome will tell me what's going on
[20:30:06] <tw2113> no idea unless it's publicly available
[20:30:35] <defaultro> yup, it's still internal
[20:31:22] <tw2113> 3rd and 4th button in that screenshot would be what you want to use
[20:31:47] <defaultro> k
[20:31:51] <defaultro> i'll try 4th
[20:32:29] <defaultro> I wish there was step to cursor like in Visual Basic
[20:32:31] <tw2113> that steps OUT of the function
[20:32:45] <tw2113> so you'd want to use the 3rd one to get into
[20:33:07] <defaultro> F11 or step into didn't work. Not really sure why :(
[20:33:14] <defaultro> that's what I do in Firebug and it does
[20:33:25] <defaultro> they are the same function keys
[20:33:33] <fission61> is this common to have jsonp returning json
[20:33:57] <tw2113> wouldn't that be the point fission61 ?
[20:36:11] <fission61> no i am making a jsonp call and getting a response back which i see in chrome debugger, but then chrome / jquery goes to parse the result i getback, because its typical json / hasmap, its not wrapped with the callback
[20:36:35] <tw2113> you didn't specify a callback
[20:36:41] <tw2113> callback=?
[20:37:49] <fission61> i do, but the web service / api i am calling just kicks back the json data i need, but its not wrapped in the callback, its weird
[20:38:36] <tw2113> what service?
[20:38:53] <defaultro> when there is a function, does Chrome highlights only(ie.) the var init = function { ...} and doesn't go inside?
[20:40:56] <fission61> tw2113: its a private api
[20:41:29] <fission61> tw2113: let me ask it a different way, if a jsonp call does not have a wrapped callback and just json, will their be an issue
[20:41:55] <defaultro> this is so weird, Chrome higllights the var function then jumps to the next var function :(
[20:41:58] <tw2113> i'd have to trial/error it
[20:42:04] <tw2113> but with that whole private api..kind of hard
[20:42:26] <tw2113> same issues with defaultro and the internal js script that he's trying to debug
[20:43:06] <tw2113> i'm a firefox fanboy as well, so that doesn't help with debugging google's crap
[20:43:19] <defaultro> :D
[20:43:34] <fission61> well debuggins aside, ia m asking a fundemental question, does a jsop call have to be wrapped with the callback
[20:43:48] <defaultro> I'm also a Firefox fanboy, love it. I just can't accept the fact they want want this app in beta next year without Chrome support
[20:44:41] <tw2113> my hunch is an api response issue fission61, something out of your control
[20:44:48] <defaultro> fission61, not really. You can set your proxy to just return a value
[20:44:53] <tw2113> but i'd be fine with being wrong
[20:45:50] <fission61> defaultro: what are you talking about, i want avoid a proxy
[20:46:02] <defaultro> why?
[20:46:16] <fission61> its weird, i get a response when i add callback=? so its like the api supports jsonp, its just not wrapping the response
[20:46:17] <defaultro> what are you calling?
[20:46:52] <tw2113> wouldn't it be the API's fault for not wrapping in a callback function or whatev?
[20:47:01] <defaultro> i agree with tw2113
[20:47:08] <defaultro> the api should return it
[20:50:06] <defaultro> looks like Chrome steps over on all functions first
[20:54:35] <fission61> i mean all this is weird, don't see why i'd get the results but not have it wrapped in callback, makes me thing i am missing something
[20:55:34] <defaultro> hey folks, I really want to become expert about listeners. Any really good links I can read up on?
[21:16:28] <csehl> whats the correct equivalent to $('#mydiv').on("create", function() { ... });  ? code that is executed whenever a div #mydiv is asynchronally loaded?
[21:17:20] <tw2113> ?load
[21:17:23] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[21:18:44] <csehl> tw2113: thanks
[21:51:54] <samholmes> how do I get the letter of the key that was pressed in an event?
[21:51:57] <samholmes> The character?
[21:52:09] <samholmes> So I can do alphabet.indexOf(ev.letter);
[21:52:13] <samholmes> see what I mean
[21:52:18] <samholmes> where ev is the event object
[22:27:22] <defaultro> what is $.extend?
[22:30:21] <csehl> when im load()ing multiple <div>'s within a .php containg all of them, how would i assign a function executed upon creation of a single one of these <div>'s ? .load(url, function(){ ... }); would execute a function on loading of the whole php, but i want to assign a function to the creation of a single element inside. is that possible?
[22:31:58] <csehl> as mentioned before, it could theoretically look something like $(#mydiv).on("load", function() { ... }); but that is most probably wrong...
[22:35:31] <samholmes> csehl: it's a method
[22:36:15] <samholmes> defaultro: ^
[22:36:42] <samholmes> defaultro: It takes one object and adds the properties of another object to it.
[22:39:27] <csehl> wouldnt it make thinds easier if $(#mydiv).on("load", function() { ... }); existed? why would you be able to latebind something to a click event, but not assign your single objects' inititalisation like that? in my case i will have to compose some new construct to be aware of which contents are loaded with the load();, kinda complicates things?
[22:46:27] <defaultro> thanks samholmes
