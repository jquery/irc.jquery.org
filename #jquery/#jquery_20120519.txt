[00:00:49] <Dr-Bombay> your html code doesn't make a whole lot of sense
[00:01:01] <Dr-Bombay> a ul as a direct child of a ul?
[00:01:20] <species> thats wrong, isnt it?
[00:01:40] <Dr-Bombay> morally wrong, if not legally
[00:02:17] <sente> if that's not immoral i dont know what is
[00:03:06] <species> yeah you should go to prison
[00:03:33] <_helpPlz_> lol
[00:03:39] <_helpPlz_> anyway i figured what i was doing wrong
[00:32:45] <poppiez> I'm trying to do: this.$el.toggleClass('no-header-toggle', 'header-toggle'); but instead of adding header-toggle it just removes no-header-toggle. shouldn't it replace it?
[00:34:13] <poppiez> was using it wrong. should be: this.$el.toggleClass('no-header-toggle header-toggle');
[00:34:16] <poppiez> thx
[00:54:02] <krz> http://pastie.org/3934378 executes. it fades the element. BUT, it doesn't remove it. in firebug i can inspect the element. it has style="display:none;" anyone know why?
[00:58:04] <Dr-Bombay> krz: do you know that the element you try to remove is the same one you animated? using $(this) in the callback will make sure of that.
[00:58:25] <krz> hm
[00:59:45] <krz> thanks for clearing that up
[01:27:06] <Whirl3d> Good morning all. Anybody have a good pubsub plugin they have used?
[01:48:29] <Whirl3d> weird...
[02:16:54] <ussher_> I had a multipage form that was working fine with .seralizeArray()  with ajax, but I had to change one of the textboxes to include tinyMCE editor.  Anybody know how to get the contents from tinymce out into searalizeArray() ?
[02:17:27] <ussher_> tinyMCE loads an iframe on a textarea.  It has an id="tinymce" but that is inside the iframe thats loaded.
[02:21:19] <Whirl3d> I didn't think you could get data from an iframe...odd. Did you look up tinyMCE's site?
[02:21:59] <ussher_> Whirl3d: i was thinking that might be the case.
[02:22:16] <ussher_> i have found a lead on stackoverflow
[02:22:39] <ussher_> just hoping there was a simple "oh, just do this.." type of answer.
[02:26:49] <Whirl3d> Yeah, youll likely have to submit the TINCYCE stuff by itself
[02:28:15] <ussher_> im loving duckduckgo :) http://duckduckgo.com/?q=tinymce+jquery
[02:28:43] <ussher_> the key was at the top of the search results.  it needed a  tinyMCE.triggerSave();
[02:29:00] <ussher_> Thanks Whirl3d

[05:05:24] <keirlav87> if you are using autocomplete that returns json with multiple values in each object, how do you tell autocomplete which value in object to display to the end user?
[05:09:21] <marrrk> I would like to send (JSON) data to a server running on localhost but not on port 80. Is this possible with JQuery? (I am writing a Chrome Extension)
[05:14:59] <Epstone> Hi, I'm loading html dynamically quite often and I've got problems catching click events on "a" tags for the dynamic content. I've tried $("a").on("click",document, function...) but this works only as long as the content is not replaced again.
[05:16:47] <Epstone> Is there a way to debug the event bubbling after Ive clicked somewhere? I'm using sammy.js and it's a kind of one page application.
[05:18:42] <keirlav87> can someone help me make understand the "custom data display" example of the ui autocomplete alittle better?
[05:18:43] <keirlav87> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
[05:19:05] <Epstone> ow lol.. sry. Just took the wrong order of selectors... $(document).on("click","a",function(){alert("test");});  is working :)
[05:21:56] <Epstone> keirlav87: the "secret" is the ._renderItem function where you can build your own "li" tag and append it to the "ul" which you are getting as a parameter
[05:22:20] <Whirl3d> keirlav87, notice in the example that the suggested text is more than just a single word...it's custom data
[05:23:10] <Stalker[LV]> Hello! I have HTML code with too many wrapping divs (5), how do I correctly use .unwrap? it only works if i do it 5 times.. I'm new to jQuery, may be i've chose incorrect method to do it?
[05:23:23] <Whirl3d> Epstone, using alert? Shame! Use debug or console.log instead...
[05:23:46] <keirlav87> Hi guys here's a paste of what's being returned by my php for a single item at the moment by my php >> http://pastebin.com/aqGj6JZv
[05:24:01] <Whirl3d> Stalker[LV], paste your code to jsfiddle and share the link
[05:24:05] <keirlav87> to the end user, i only want to display "Agent_Name"s' value
[05:24:13] <keirlav87> but can't get my head around it at the moment
[05:24:18] <keirlav87> thanks for taking an interest though!
[05:25:26] <Whirl3d> keirlav87, check out the remote JSONP results on the same jqueryUI page. maybe that will help?
[05:26:06] <Epstone> Whirl3d: yes you're right, it was just a fast chrome console test piece
[05:28:10] <keirlav87> ah its ok, i've got it working
[05:28:31] <keirlav87> not through understanding but chopping away at their example though which is frustrating :P
[05:29:33] <keirlav87> my problem was that i had changed the final .data part from .data("autocomplete") to .data("#myautocomplete")
[05:29:58] <keirlav87> would anyone mind telling me briefly why that killed the results from displaying correctly?
[05:31:14] <Whirl3d> keirlav87, if you setup a working fiddle on JSfiddle.net, it's a lot easier to troubleshoot
[05:31:42] <Stalker[LV]> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/dTv4Q/
[05:32:35] <Whirl3d> Stalker[LV], why not just select the content you want and append it to the location you want. Then delete the empty divs
[05:33:35] <Whirl3d> like $(".contacts").appendTo("body"); $(".glass_wrapper").remove()
[05:34:42] <Epstone> @keirlav87 "#myautocomplete" would be the selector to your element. With '.data("autocomplete")' you access the autocomplete data of that DOM element
[05:35:35] <tra> what would be the most reliable way to detect "which mediaquery" the browser is currently using?
[05:36:02] <tra> i need to reset ad-gallery and give it different dimensions when orientation changes for example.
[05:36:25] <Whirl3d> sounds like a job for #css or #html, I dunno nada about media-queries.
[05:37:51] <tra> well i need to detect it in javascript some how, cus i need to reset a img-gallery when orientation changes for example.
[05:39:00] <Whirl3d> wish I could help ya, but like I said, I have no idea. I'll google it for ya if you'd like.
[05:40:04] <keirlav87> Epstone: thanks :)
[05:42:18] <Epstone> keirlav87: np
[06:17:17] <rabbi1> How can i reduce the size of JQuery UI Tabbed navigation ?
[06:25:45] <Whirl3d> override the css
[06:33:36] <codebeaker> hi all, is there a way to make an animation (UI.effect.highlight) to stop the calling function from returning until it's finished ?
[06:33:57] <codebeaker> I'm trying to wrap my head around a promise, but when I'm trying to prevent the function returning, I'm not sure how it applies
[06:35:50] <brettfrable>  i'm using modernizer to support html5 and css3 in ie
[06:35:50] <brettfrable> [09:35:41] <brettfrable> and the @font-face isn't working
[06:35:50] <brettfrable> [09:35:44] <brettfrable> any idea why?
[06:38:35] <Whirl3d> codebreaker, a promise works like this:  you create a deferred object, then prepare your animation with a callback function that resolves that deferred object. Then you return the deferred's promise.  So outside of your animation function you could do   customAnimate().done(doWhatever);
[06:38:51] <Whirl3d> and doWhatever won't happen until the animation is over
[06:39:38] <rethus> how can i deselect all checkboxes of a form - fast and easy?
[06:39:46] <rethus> is there something like form-reset
[06:39:57] <Whirl3d> why not just use form reset
[06:40:10] <rethus> have to fire it dynamicly
[06:41:19] <Whirl3d> $("input:checkbox").prop("checked", false);  ?   Not sure
[06:42:28] <brettfrable> again
[06:42:31] <brettfrable> anyone know>
[06:46:50] <xjiujiu> brettfrable,what'w your problem?
[06:47:01] <brettfrable> www.brettfrable.com
[06:47:08] <brettfrable> i converted it to an html5 doc
[06:47:18] <brettfrable> and the site obv stopped working correctly
[06:47:24] <brettfrable> loaded modernizr
[06:47:30] <brettfrable> and the @font-face stopped working
[06:47:33] <qdk> Is the a flag or something on <img> tag to check to see if the image is selected/marked or not? Like if i wanna what images in a gallery i have selected dragging the mouse over them.
[06:47:37] <brettfrable> I'm testing ie8 right now
[06:49:26] <Whirl3d> qdk see jquery UI selectable
[06:49:38] <Whirl3d> http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/
[06:49:38] <qdk> Whirl3d: ty, ill look into that.
[06:49:44] <qdk> nice ty
[06:52:22] <brettfrable> any idea xjiujiu?
[06:56:38] <xjiujiu> brettfrable, um sorry I will not fix this problem.It just occurs in the ie browser?
[07:29:07] <antnash> Hey guys. I want to change the background colour of a table row when it's clicked, but only if it's not a double click. I'm assuming I have to do this with a timer, but how would I do that? The problem I can envisage is differing double click times on different machines. Is there a way to check this? So my idea is...
[07:30:13] <_cb> <div id = "myDiv" onmouseover="muFunc(this)"... function myFunc(x){} How do I create another div on top of myDiv?
[07:31:40] <Whirl3d> antnash, make a fiddle
[07:32:05] <antnash> $('#tableid tr').live('click', function() { starttimer(dblclicktime, function() { if(!another_click_detected) { do stuff } }); });
[07:32:28] <antnash> Whirl3d: I would, but I really have no idea how to do what I wanna do.
[07:33:28] <Whirl3d> I am working on it for ya. Gimme a minute
[07:34:32] <antnash> Cheers man. I'm sure it's gotta be possible. I really should be focussing on more important functional elements of my app, but this is annoying me!
[07:38:59] <Whirl3d> http://api.jquery.com/dblclick/
[07:41:15] <Whirl3d> antnash, I need an html table that looks like the html table in question. Go to jsfiddle.net and paste a copy of an example table like yours in the upper left hand panel. Click save and share and copy/paste the share address here
[07:41:42] <antnash> cool. Gimme a sec
[07:43:34] <Stalker[LV]> guys, one more stupid question: is it ok to use $(document).ready more then 1 time?
[07:44:02] <Whirl3d> yep
[07:44:12] <Whirl3d> they will fire in order, but yes
[07:44:43] <bobbytek2> anyone using jquery with backbone? Just curious on when one might create a jquery plugin vs. a backbone component
[07:46:50] <antnash> Whirl3d: jsfiddle not css3? trying to use :nth-child() and it ain't working
[07:47:20] <Whirl3d> it works. Try nthChild or deselect normalize CSS
[07:47:53] <Whirl3d> jquery doesn't like '-' in selectors, so they use camelCase
[07:48:08] <antnash> ignore me
[07:48:27] <Stalker[LV]> Whirl3d, thank you
[07:48:37] <Whirl3d> np
[07:53:52] <antnash> Whirl3d: This is what I've got so far http://jsfiddle.net/JzHYH/
[07:55:23] <_cb> <div id = "myDiv" onmouseover="myFunc(this)"... function myFunc(x){} How do I get the left,top coordinates of x?
[07:56:37] <bobbytek2> no fans of require here?
[07:56:39] <bobbytek2> :(
[07:56:46] <bobbytek2> It's really cleaned up my code
[07:59:07] <antnash> Whirl3d: Actually this is more like it
[07:59:47] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/4dLFx/4/
[08:01:17] <antnash> http://jsfiddle.net/JzHYH/1/
[08:01:24] <antnash> Forgot to add the link
[08:03:12] <antnash> That doesn't highlight them at all on mine.
[08:07:24] <Whirl3d> weird thing here. http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/JzHYH/6/
[08:07:59] <Whirl3d> You'll notice it logs clicked on single click events but doesn't highlight. I think it's because it loses "this"... one sec
[08:08:15] <antnash> Ah right
[08:09:30] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/JzHYH/7/
[08:09:55] <Whirl3d> in setTimeout, the reference to "this" is lost. So by caching it up front (which is better anyways), it works.
[08:09:57] <antnash> Yeah, that's exactly what I just changed it to
[08:10:13] <antnash> Doesn't seem to uncheck tho
[08:10:26] <Whirl3d> does for me
[08:11:20] <antnash> sorry, I missed out one $(this) change
[08:11:55] <Whirl3d> also, stop using .live
[08:11:59] <Whirl3d> use .on instead
[08:11:59] <antnash> Any idea what the dblclick timout is?
[08:12:04] <antnash> ah, ok
[08:12:12] <Whirl3d> no idea. Probably in the docs though.
[08:12:21] <antnash> I keep getting told so many different ways
[08:12:32] <Whirl3d> There's undoubtedly a better way to do this.
[08:12:34] <antnash> what are the pros/cons to live/bind/on?
[08:12:42] <Whirl3d> live is being deprecated
[08:12:51] <jankes> hello
[08:13:00] <jankes> i would like to ask about advice.
[08:13:23] <jankes> i want to learn java and java prime faces
[08:13:24] <Whirl3d> It attaches the handler to the dom, so whever antyhing is clicked, it runs through a huge table of "live" listeners to see it if qualifies...slow and ugly
[08:13:34] <Whirl3d> i'm exaggerating for effect, btw
[08:13:42] <jankes> is there any good way to take this knowledge about programming?
[08:13:42] <antnash> jankes: wrong place. Try #java
[08:14:06] <antnash> lol. Right, I'll switch to on
[08:14:23] <Whirl3d> Whereas with .on you can attach it to the element or (if dynamically adding/removing elements) to the parent of the those elements and it will only fire when needed. Much faster
[08:14:31] <jankes> i need for only invite
[08:14:44] <Whirl3d> jankes, you have to register your nick
[08:15:18] <jankes> i do not register my nick. i am a really not bad person
[08:15:29] <jankes> i live in poland and my english isn't brillent
[08:15:55] <Whirl3d> you are being denied because you do not have a registered nick. Not because you are bad
[08:17:12] <antnash> Yeah, they won't let you in because they don't like your shoes.
[08:17:35] <Whirl3d> requiring registered nicks helps keep the idiots and spammers out. Look up IRC on google and there are lots of resources to help you register your nick.
[08:17:50] <antnash> And they're very image conscious.
[08:19:15] <jankes> Whirl3d: thank you. if you were me what would you do due to take a java?
[08:20:19] <Whirl3d> jankes, I really am not sure where to start with java. Maybe take a class at MS Technet or something...
[08:20:50] <jankes> what is ms technet
[08:21:02] <jankes> i would like to find a good address
[08:21:31] <jankes> i found this channel on java prime faces and jquery a web page
[08:22:17] <antnash> jankes: java != javascript
[08:22:39] <Whirl3d> I'm a registered Microsoft Technet Subscriber, so they offer lots of classes as part of the program. You should just search  Google for java resources. O'reilly books are good. HeadsUp can be good too.
[08:23:44] <jankes> Whirl3d: for free?
[08:24:07] <jankes> antnash: i know about it
[08:24:59] <Whirl3d> naw. It costs about $300/year but gives you access to all MS software to download for free. Well worth the deal
[08:27:23] <jankes> so, where i can find free java resources for totally beginners
[08:27:24] <jankes> ?
[08:27:42] <shoky> oracle.com ?
[08:29:13] <otherj> why do you ask in #jquery about java?
[08:29:25] <otherj> ;o)
[08:31:17] <jankes> otherj: i found this channel at jquery a web  page
[08:32:26] <vlad27aug> jankes: what otherj meant is that jquery is based on javascript...a completely different language than java
[08:32:54] <jankes> really???
[08:33:08] <jankes> but i looked at java prime faces
[08:33:10] <vlad27aug> yes...the name must have confused you...but they are completely unrelated
[08:33:13] <jankes> web page
[08:33:19] <jankes> ooops
[08:33:37] <vlad27aug> :)
[08:34:31] * jankes i am surprise
[08:36:00] <unique_> anybody here willing to have a look at a possible bug i found in jQuery.unique() ?
[08:36:51] <jankes> but i use a template
[08:37:55] <rbennion> Hi all! I am trying to grab the value of: <span class="field-content new-title">Skills-Building Coaching and Training for Sales Forces</span> and place it in jQuery("title").text("HERE");
[08:40:11] <rbennion> Can someone help me with the proper syntax. Thanks.
[08:41:35] <ArtificialEX> anyone used jquery tools?
[08:41:38] <ArtificialEX> calendar
[08:41:53] <unique_> rbennion : jQuery("title").val($('span.new-title'))
[08:42:09] <rbennion> unique_: thanks a bunch
[08:42:26] <Whirl3d> $("title").text($(".field-content-new-title").text());
[08:44:15] <unique_> .text(.text()) is really awkward
[08:44:27] <unique_> thats what .val() is or
[08:44:33] <unique_> +f
[08:45:08] <Whirl3d> seriously? I didn't know .val() worked for non form elements.
[08:45:34] <unique_> .val has nothing to do with forms .... it sets the value wherever possible
[08:45:47] <unique_> on some elements, only .html works
[08:45:56] <Whirl3d> I guess I didn't knowthat span's had a value
[08:46:04] <Raydiation> can i get the mimetype of an ajax request?
[08:46:43] <Whirl3d> just this once Raydiation. But after today the answer is no
[08:46:48] <rbennion> I thought a value was anything in an elemnet
[08:47:02] <Raydiation> Whirl3d: :(
[08:47:06] <Whirl3d> 8)
[08:47:11] <unique_> exactly. and span is a element
[08:47:34] <unique_> BUT i too have observed that .val doesnt work on some of them, dunno about span
[08:48:10] <rbennion> I can't use $ in my codeâ€¦can I replace the $ in jQuery("title").val($('span.new-title')); with the word jQuery?
[08:48:18] <Whirl3d> ?eval($(<span><a href="#">Test</a></span>).val())
[08:48:20] <bot-t> Whirl3d, Source for "The West Petee's utilities [NO LONGER UPDATED ... - http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/96584#">Test</a></span>).val())
[08:48:34] <Whirl3d> lol, yeah bot-t
[08:48:37] <unique_> of course, these are interchangeable
[08:50:06] <Whirl3d> The .val() method is primarily used to get the values of form elements such as input, select and textarea. In the case of <select multiple="multiple"> elements, the .val() method returns an array containing each selected option; if no option is selected, it returns null.
[08:50:59] <Milos> I have $(document).scrollTop($(document).height()); inside an ajax callback insite a document ready, and it doesn't work
[08:51:05] <Milos> it's meant to scroll to the bottom of the page
[08:51:09] <Milos> am I potentially doing something wrong
[08:51:15] <Milos> or is there a better way to scoll to the bottom
[08:51:52] <Whirl3d> I guess someone needs to make sure to include some reference to val() returning the contents of some html elements other than form elements  when they do the next update.
[08:51:56] <rbennion> I could not get val() to work, I used .txt and that works
[08:53:15] <rbennion> I don't know if it has to do with the span element...
[08:53:23] <Whirl3d> I am pretty sure that .val() returns the contents of the "value" attribute for form elements with the exceptions of checkbox, textarea and a couple of others where there is not value attribute
[08:53:29] <Whirl3d> or property* rather
[08:54:24] <Whirl3d> ? eval($("<span>test</span>").val())

[08:55:36] <ArtificialEX> hey im having trouble qith jquery tools calendar, its appending class 'date' to ALL my elemnts
[08:55:48] <rbennion> Thanks both for your helpâ€¦its working great.
[08:55:57] <Whirl3d> Milos, you might want to consider using the ScrollTo plugin by Ariel Fleischer. It's great
[08:55:59] <ArtificialEX> http://paste.laravel.com/1B0
[08:56:15] <ArtificialEX> the only thing i changed was adding #calendar to :$("#calendar:date").dateinput( {
[08:56:30] <ArtificialEX> because before it was just :date, thought maybe thats why it was adding to all classes
[08:56:38] <Milos> Whirl3d, thanks I'll take a look. But such a basic thing I must be able to get working somehow. I think it's related to when I destroy an element and quickly try to scroll, I think it scrolls to the bottom then the new elements show up.
[08:57:45] <Whirl3d> set up a fiddle and we could look at it. Otherwise it's a complete crap shoot to try to guess
[08:57:59] <Milos> lolol
[08:58:18] <Whirl3d> You'd have to be a genius like Shoky or AjPiano, Coldhead, Eviltwin...there are lots of em here. I am not one of them, though.
[08:58:34] <Milos> I think fadein doesn't block
[08:58:40] <Milos> could that be why?
[08:58:58] <Eviltwin> fadeIn does not block
[08:59:04] <Milos> I did an alert(document height var) and it showed up before the content, even though I put it AFTER the fadein
[08:59:13] <Milos> can I make fadein block?
[08:59:17] <Eviltwin> No
[08:59:20] <Eviltwin> But it has a callback
[08:59:25] <Milos> ah that's it
[08:59:30] <Milos> freakin callbacks
[08:59:33] <Milos> I have a million of them
[08:59:33] <Milos> haahah
[09:01:26] <Milos> IT WORKS
[09:01:32] <Milos> thanks Eviltwin and Whirl3d :)
[09:03:01] <opalepatrick> new to jquery, javascript. Can anyone look at this success response and give me an idea why I am not getting any response? - http://pastebin.com/9gY4HDm4
[09:03:21] <opalepatrick> Actually I mean not getting anything logged... response is good
[09:03:28] <Whirl3d> Told ya Eviltwin was a genius...lol 8)
[09:03:50] <Eviltwin> opalepatrick: Is that top part what the server is sending back?
[09:04:03] <opalepatrick> sorry yes it is Eviltwin
[09:04:06] <Eviltwin> Are you json_encode-ing it or something?
[09:04:11] <Eviltwin> Or literally sending that back
[09:04:31] <opalepatrick> I am json_encoding it from a php script
[09:04:35] <Eviltwin> Have you set the dataType to "json"?
[09:04:40] <opalepatrick> I have
[09:05:00] <Eviltwin> Have you tried logging out just "data" right inside the success function?
[09:05:15] <opalepatrick> I did try and got nada Eviltwin
[09:05:31] <Eviltwin> Do you have an error function?
[09:05:49] <Eviltwin> Perhaps what you're sending back has a non-success status code or doesn't actually parse
[09:06:14] <opalepatrick> not sure Eviltwin - just working with firebug and not getting any errors
[09:07:08] <Eviltwin> After your success: function(data) { ... } add error: function(xhr, status, error) { console.log(status); console.log(error); }
[09:07:20] <Eviltwin> It's another setting
[09:07:44] <Eviltwin> If the success isn't running, odds are there's some kind of error
[09:08:29] <opalepatrick> I will have a go at theat Eviltwin - thanks for the help... may be back :-)
[09:13:16] <opalepatrick> Eviltwin, getting an error - function statement requires a name - on that line ^^
[09:13:29] <opalepatrick> sorry clueless with syntax at the mo
[09:13:51] <Eviltwin> I'm going to suggest that you see ?learn
[09:13:51] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[09:13:57] <Eviltwin> Look at those resources
[09:14:03] <opalepatrick> ok will do
[09:14:19] <opalepatrick> thanks Eviltwin
[09:20:22] <Whirl3d> resolveWith($(element)) calls the registered callbacksin the context of the jqueryObject $(element ) or the element itself?
[09:21:12] <antnash> Whirl3d, I've tried changing  my lives to ons, and it works in jsfiddle but not on my machine for some reason
[09:21:20] <Eviltwin> resolveWith(x) calls the registered callbacks with the context of x
[09:21:36] <Eviltwin> Deferreds don't do anything special with jQuery collections
[09:23:12] <ArtificialEX> http://paste.laravel.com/1B0
[09:23:22] <ArtificialEX> does this look like it would append .date to all my classes?
[09:24:13] <Eviltwin> Well you're using a plugin
[09:24:23] <Eviltwin> Even though it's only .dateinput(...)
[09:24:27] <Eviltwin> A lot could be happening in there
[09:24:33] <ArtificialEX> oh
[09:24:47] <ArtificialEX> i just put the calendar in a wrapper and say #calendar:date
[09:24:57] <ArtificialEX> it seems to help, but still the jquery tools calendar is wacky, absolute positioning
[09:26:17] <Eviltwin> And what I'm saying is that it'd be the code for dateinput that's causing your problem
[09:26:21] <Eviltwin> Not jQuery itself
[09:26:37] <Eviltwin> You'll have to look at the Documentation and Forums for jQuery tools
[09:28:44] <opalepatrick> coming back to earlier, Eviltwin (once I placed the error code correctly) - I am only getting a parsererror (unexpected character) in the minimised jquery code
[09:29:13] <ArtificialEX> you guys reecommend jqueryui or jquerytools or something else?
[09:29:33] <sorahn> hey guys, is there a better way to set up this type of function? http://jsfiddle.net/wLXBg/
[09:30:36] <sorahn> specifically being able to call a function with .on('e', myFunction) and $.myFunction
[09:35:26] <Milos> if I have something like
[09:35:30] <Milos> semesters_0
[09:35:32] <Milos> semesters_1
[09:35:33] <Milos> etc
[09:35:35] <Milos> and I want to just grab the number
[09:35:45] <Milos> how do I do it? I tried parseInt() but I got NaN
[09:36:01] <sorahn> parseint has to start with a number
[09:36:27] <sorahn> Milos: maybe this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6340180/regex-to-get-the-number-from-the-end-of-a-string
[09:37:06] <Milos> sorahn, genius thank you
[09:37:18] <sorahn> s/genius/google/g
[09:37:22] <sorahn> ;)
[09:38:21] <Milos> sshhhhh
[09:38:31] <Milos> works perfectly, thank you
[09:38:32] <Milos> :D
[09:39:14] <antnash> sorahn: Any idea why live would be working for me but on and bind not?
[09:39:35] <antnash> Or to anyone else for that matter
[09:40:24] <sorahn> antnash: 1.7+?
[09:40:30] <antnash> yup
[09:40:33] <sorahn> try on
[09:40:38] <sorahn> .on*
[09:40:47] <antnash> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js
[09:41:04] <antnash> .on*?
[09:41:11] <sorahn> as far as i know, .on is supposed to be the most use case replacement for bind and live
[09:41:37] <sorahn> i don't know how to work the bot here, but http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:41:55] <antnash> It works in jsfiddle, but not on my machine
[09:42:05] <sorahn> lol
[09:42:13] <sorahn> sounds like standard javascript to me
[09:42:16] <antnash> I mean on my page
[09:42:17] <sorahn> 60% of the time it works all the time.
[09:42:19] <sorahn> :P
[09:42:27] <antnash> lol
[09:42:33] <antnash> bloody pain in the ass
[09:42:45] <sorahn> thats the damn truth
[09:45:56] <antnash> sorahn: Looks like I might have been using on wrong. Can I not do  $(selector).on('event', function() {}); ?
[09:47:02] <Milos> what's the best way to make an infinite fadeoutfadein?
[09:47:37] <sorahn> antnash: you can.
[09:47:50] <antnash> hmm
[09:52:33] <Eviltwin> opalepatrick: That means the JSON you're sending back has an issue in it
[09:53:02] <Eviltwin> Try going to that URL in the browser and make sure it looks like JSON with no garbage on either side
[09:53:18] <Eviltwin> You can copy/paste to jsonlint.com to confirm
[09:54:12] <opalepatrick> Eviltwin, you were dead right. I was just about to say that the response wasnt json_encoded (I had commented it out when testing the php script, what a dunce! Anyway that error function was great info so thanks for the help.
[09:54:58] <Eviltwin> antnash: If you have $("[selector]").live("event", function() { ... })
[09:55:15] <antnash> yup
[09:55:16] <Eviltwin> The new syntax to do that is $(document).on("event", "[selector]", function() { ... })
[09:55:36] <Eviltwin> This is documented on the API page for both .on and .live I believe
[09:55:44] <antnash> Yeah, that's what the docs said. But in jsfiddle it works with just replacing live with on
[09:56:19] <Eviltwin> Do you understand what $("[selector]").bind("event", function() { ... }) does?
[09:56:40] <Eviltwin> The so-called "static binding"
[09:58:20] <antnash> Not really, no
[09:58:50] <Eviltwin> The $("[selector]") builds (essentially) an array of the elements in the document that match that selector
[09:59:05] <Eviltwin> Then the .bind goes to each one of those elements and adds an event listener to that specific element
[09:59:32] <Eviltwin> Meaning that if later on those elements no longer match that selector (because they've been moved or a class changed or something),
[09:59:37] <Eviltwin> they'll still have that event listener
[09:59:40] <Eviltwin> Additionally
[10:00:03] <Eviltwin> New elements that match the selector but didn't match when you ran that line won't get the event listener
[10:00:35] <orangey> hello all
[10:00:53] <orangey> I'm trying to make something happen with an autocomplete value. So, I have my source giving value and label
[10:01:14] <orangey> however, it doesn't look like value will give anything. only label
[10:01:21] <antnash> so with on it fixes those issues?
[10:01:30] <orangey> how can I get autocomplete to instead give up a value for me to put somewhere?
[10:05:42] <Eviltwin> antnash: http://jsfiddle.net/g6mdN/
[10:05:47] <Eviltwin> I gotta go
[10:05:51] <Eviltwin> But I hope that clears things up
[10:06:44] <antnash> Eviltwin: That's perfect, ta
[10:07:22] <antnash> They were being added from mysql data dynamically so needed a dynamic binding. Ta!
[10:14:09] <Whirl3d> antnash, how are you getting data into and out of mySql?
[10:27:08] <Qiller> hi, anyone can help-me? http://pastebin.com/pGKQrxG4
[10:35:41] <ArtificialEX> is there a :containsall, like :contains?
[10:37:57] <ArtificialEX> $("div:contains('1'), highlights 1 and 11 for me
[10:38:02] <ArtificialEX> i need it to just highlight '1'
[10:38:43] <dabear> ArtificialEX: $("div").filter(function(){ return this.innerHTML === "1"})
[10:39:25] <ArtificialEX> dabear: thanks, if I'm adding it to multiple, will that work
[10:39:30] <ArtificialEX> like say 1, 13, and 19
[10:39:34] <ArtificialEX> do i need an if statement
[10:39:47] <dabear> ArtificialEX: learn javascript
[10:42:38] <ArtificialEX> dabear: no that would be jquery
[10:42:56] <ArtificialEX> didnt know js had filters
[10:43:49] <ArtificialEX> plus this works better
[10:43:49] <ArtificialEX> $("a[href='#16'], a[href='#1']").addClass('hasEvent');
[10:43:53] <ArtificialEX> so you learn js ;)
[10:47:28] <sunbeam> I'm using the flexslider plugin, but i can't manage to have the <p>Some image text</p> that's in the same li the image is in hide for each slide and show when the li of the actual slide is active
[10:50:55] <antnash> Whirl3d: php. Why?
[10:53:45] <antnash> Is there somewhere I can search for libraries hosted on google, like https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js for jquery?
[10:56:04] <Milos> Ok guys.
[10:56:06] <Milos> So I have something like this: http://dpaste.com/750270/
[10:56:12] <Milos> What's the best way to stop it with jQuery?
[10:56:18] <Milos> Or how could I implement that in pure jQuery?
[10:58:27] <ajpiano> var t = setTimeout( fn, ms ); clearTimeout( t );
[10:58:49] <Milos> :O!!
[10:58:51] <Milos> wow
[10:59:01] <Milos> let me see if I can do that
[10:59:19] <danielwrobert> Qiller: Maybe try something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/5RzTM/1/
[11:00:01] <ajpiano> antnash: what do you mean "search"
[11:00:35] <ajpiano> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/ antnash
[11:00:59] <antnash> ajpiano, That was the one I was after! Cheers.
[11:01:17] <ajpiano> antnash: not only does google have ajax libraries API, they also have a search engine ;)
[11:01:20] <ajpiano> no prob though :)
[11:01:34] <antnash> fecking smartass :)
[11:02:47] <Milos> ajpiano, thank you SO MUCH
[11:03:41] <ajpiano> :)
[11:09:46] <kollapse> Hi. I'm getting error - "Syntax error at line 783 while loading: expected '}', got <end of file>". I don't know why it happens. Please help. Here is code http://i0.simplest-image-hosting.net/picture/klingon.png
[11:13:19] <sunbeam> whats a recommendable slider (imageslider ) plugin for jquery? flex slider?
[11:23:57] <Trieste> hi, I have a strange problem - I put some code and an AJAX request  in $(window).unload , but the code seems to be executed only if I put an "alert()" in there - what gives?
[11:31:38] <Trieste> please, anyone? I really have no idea why would an alert() change the behavior, so I don't even know where to start
[11:35:40] <bryano_> Is there a way to get the data from a getJSON call to leave the getJSON function??  i've tried assigning it to a globally defined object but that doesn't work.
[11:37:12] <Qiller> danielwrobert: thank ;D
[11:41:01] <Trieste> yay, I guess it was because the javascript execution was stopped before the server responded, meaning the handler didn't get called - setting "async" to false fixed it. So never mind :)
[11:43:18] <_cb> <div onmouseover="vf_test(this)"... function vf_test(e){... Is there something I can do to reference e as a jquery object to do things like e.show() ?
[11:45:56] <ravenzz> don't make your markup dirty
[11:46:09] <ravenzz> _cb avoid that inline js
[11:46:27] <kerx__> hello all, I'm trying to figure out what type of input box that is in  $(this)
[11:46:36] <kerx__> Is it possible to check if it's a radio, or select, or input?
[11:47:00] <ravenzz> ?is @ kerx__
[11:47:00] <caniuse> kerx__: .is(): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return <code>true</code> if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[11:47:27] <kerx__> oh, perfect
[11:49:32] <LucaS05> hi...i've a problem of performance here http://bit.ly/Mvj9ob the problem is about loading chunks of another page containing photos
[11:49:49] <LucaS05> if somebody can help me i will explain where to go
[11:57:18] <LucaS05> no one?
[12:08:17] <kerx__> Anyone know how I can JSON encode an entire form ready to pass into a ajax POST?
[12:08:34] <sunbeam> I have a html5 template that i coded based on a psd design. i used flexslider as slider, how can i make it possible that the images that are used in flexslider and the caption can be changed in wordpress?
[12:10:27] <ajpiano> kerx__: i would use ben alman's serialzeObject plugin and then JSON.stringify the output
[12:10:38] <ajpiano> ?g ba serializeobject github
[12:10:39] <bot-t> ajpiano, cowboy/jquery-misc · GitHub - https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-misc
[12:11:10] <ajpiano> var jsonstring = JSON.stringify( $("#form").serializeObject() );
[12:11:12] <ajpiano> ?stringify
[12:11:13] <bot-t> JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[12:11:26] <ajpiano> https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-misc/blob/master/jquery.ba-serializeobject.js
[12:16:21] <kerx__> I'm not sure what approach to take here.  I have a form with many radio boxes.  Each radio box group is set with an ID, then the values are ID's that correspond to the database.  I want to basically do a POST call with the  group_id  and the checked  radio value.
[12:16:44] <kerx__> Can you guys recommend how to programmatically approach this with lots of flexibility?
[12:17:21] <ravenzz> kerx__ you can use an anonymous function and return when you want to exit
[12:17:26] <imsky> mossskow diskoow
[12:17:27] <ravenzz> az
[12:17:32] <ravenzz> wrong channel/guy
[12:17:42] <imsky> i'm the right guy
[12:17:51] <imsky> i'm always the right guy
[12:17:52] <kerx__> ravenzz: not sure what you mean?
[12:18:16] <kerx__> I have something like this:    $("#order_options :input").each(function(){    â€¦..  });
[12:18:45] <kerx__> #order_options is a form,  and  what I do is:   Check if it's a checkbox or radio, then check if it's checked.
[12:19:01] <Eviltwin> kerx__: http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[12:19:10] <kerx__> Right after that last check, I'd like to add the checkbox/radio ID and the Value into JSON
[12:19:25] <kerx__> Is it possible to some how push something into a JSON string?
[12:19:38] <ajpiano> you can't manipulate a json string like an object
[12:19:42] <kerx__> Eviltwin: thanks, but I already know how to check whether the checkbox/radio is selected
[12:19:44] <ajpiano> and you shouldn't manipulate it as a string
[12:19:47] <thomedy>   $("body").live('.mannequin_or_designer', 'click', function(){
[12:19:51] <thomedy> why isn't that working
[12:19:56] <thomedy> its saying its not a function
[12:19:59] <ajpiano> you should just wait to serialize the JSON string until the object is prepared
[12:20:17] <ajpiano> thomedy: that's not the signature for live, and what version of jquery are you us ing
[12:20:20] <ajpiano> 1.2.6 ??
[12:20:24] <kerx__> ajpiano: So you are suggesting that I build an object, and then turn the object into a JSON string ready for the POST?
[12:20:29] <Eviltwin> thomedy: Don't use .live, it's deprecated, use .on if you have it (1.7+) or use .delegate if you don't
[12:20:41] <ajpiano> kerx__: i'm suggesting you use the serializeObject plugin i linked you to earlier
[12:20:45] <Eviltwin> Your syntax looks more like that of .delegate
[12:20:56] <thomedy> live wasn't working either
[12:20:58] <ajpiano> which is the same as jquery's serialize but it gives you an object with k/v pairs instead of a querystring
[12:21:01] <Eviltwin> see ?live see ?delegate see ?on
[12:21:01] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[12:21:01] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[12:21:02] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:21:03] <thomedy> so used delegate too
[12:21:11] <Eviltwin> Read those pages
[12:21:13] <thomedy> and this might be the ctrl + z of it
[12:21:17] <thomedy> let me tcheck
[12:21:44] <kerx__> I'm hesitant in using a plugin
[12:21:56] <ajpiano> kerx__: for what POSSIBLE reason
[12:21:57] <kerx__> Is there a way to do this just using standard jQuery and Javascript?
[12:22:01] <ajpiano> it's a tiny plugin that just wraps around serializeArray
[12:22:18] <ajpiano> and gives you an object back instead of an array of [{name: "foo", value: "bar}]
[12:22:23] <kerx__> So why don't I just use  serializeArray ?
[12:22:27] <thomedy>   $("body").delegate('.mannequin_or_designer', 'click', function(){
[12:22:32] <thomedy> yeah tahts the one i meant sorry
[12:22:34] <thomedy> im getting tired
[12:22:41] <ajpiano> because do you want an array of objects in that format
[12:22:51] <kerx__> I'm not sure :)
[12:22:56] <ajpiano> or do you want an actual object with key value pairs with "elemname": "elemvalue"
[12:23:00] <kerx__> This is the first time I'm doing something like this
[12:23:53] <ajpiano> to step back a second
[12:24:08] <ajpiano> why do you need to find out if it's checked manually or anything
[12:24:18] <Eviltwin> You could do var output = {}; $(".mycheckboxes").each(function() { if(this.checked) output[this.name] = "yes"; });
[12:24:22] <ajpiano> serialize, serializeArray, serializeObject... will all give you the value of the input elements that are checked
[12:24:37] <ajpiano> you don't need to do anything special manually
[12:24:48] <Eviltwin> But ajpiano's right, what's special about your case?
[12:25:06] <Eviltwin> Where a normal form serialization won't work
[12:25:12] <kerx__> ajpiano: I have many radio's in a form.  Each group of radio's have an ID value, then they have a unique actual VALUE.  Something like:   <input type="radio" id="1" value="1">  <input type="radio" id="1" value="2">
[12:25:24] <kerx__> I'm doing an .each() on every radio box inside this form.
[12:25:38] <ajpiano> kerx__: radio groups aren't supposed to be linked by the id attribute
[12:25:40] <kerx__> I'm checking which one is checked.  So at the end, I'd like to pass a JSON string
[12:25:43] <ajpiano> they're supposed to be linked by the name attribute
[12:25:55] <kerx__> Hrm.
[12:25:56] <ajpiano> and you should never under any circumstances have multiple elements with the same ID in your dom
[12:26:37] <Eviltwin> It might also be time for you to make a jsFiddle showing us an example of your setup with your expected output from this code
[12:26:44] <kerx__> Okay, so this is my loop in Smarty:
[12:26:44] <kerx__> id="{$step1.id}" name="{$step1.id}" value="{$option.id}"
[12:26:52] <kerx__> I can remove the id, and just leave the name="..."
[12:27:08] <kerx__> Then I can in here:   $("#order_options :input").each(function(){  â€¦.  });
[12:27:42] <kerx__> So to get at the end only the name & value of these radio's into a JSON string
[12:27:57] <kerx__> Would you propose that I use the plugin or just the standard serialize functions in jQuery base?
[12:28:30] <haizum> is there a way to use css to manipulate other div's upon hover, or only the one being hovered over? would that require javascript?
[12:28:32] <ravenzz> teh standard serialize function doesn't give you a json encoded object
[12:28:33] <Eviltwin> If your goal is to have a "foo=bar&foo2=bar2"-style string
[12:28:38] <Eviltwin> Use .serialize()
[12:29:02] <ajpiano> kerx__: if you want to get a JSON string of {"1": "2"} then use the plugin and stringify
[12:29:13] <ravenzz> kerx__ do you need to process some JSON object in your backend?
[12:29:51] <kerx__> ravenzz: Since I'm in the development stage, I'm not forced to do something yet.  I was thinking I just do a json_decode($_POST) and then deal with it in PHP
[12:30:15] <ravenzz> I don't see why you would do that
[12:30:22] <Eviltwin> You know that $_POST is a part of the "foo=bar&foo2=bar2" style, right?
[12:30:29] <Eviltwin> parse*
[12:30:38] <Eviltwin> It parses that format
[12:30:57] <kerx__> Well if I post a JSON string, what should I use to read it in PHP?
[12:31:09] <Eviltwin> You need to open php://input
[12:31:10] <ravenzz> oh nice
[12:31:12] <Eviltwin> Then read in the text
[12:31:16] <Eviltwin> Then parse it
[12:32:02] <Eviltwin> json_decode(file_get_contents('php://input'));
[12:32:10] <Eviltwin> vs just use $_POST
[12:32:16] <Eviltwin> Since it's already parsed
[12:32:25] <kerx__> Yea, you're right :)
[12:32:29] <ravenzz> kerx__ if you don't know how to do that, and you are not forced to do that because of some existing server side logic
[12:32:35] <ravenzz> use regular post requests
[12:32:48] <kerx__> I don't want to use regular POST, I'm worried about the encoding
[12:32:56] <kerx__> Sometimes I may have weird characters
[12:33:03] <kerx__> I like how jQuery can encode those for me :)
[12:34:20] <Eviltwin> *sigh*
[12:34:22] <kerx__> Okay, so you guys have given me enough to work and think about
[12:34:30] <kerx__> Eviltwin: :-(
[12:34:40] <Eviltwin> .serialize() will encode properly
[12:34:44] <Eviltwin> And PHP will decode properly
[12:35:00] <Eviltwin> So your point about using regular POST is moot
[12:35:08] <kerx__> Eviltwin: why?
[12:35:33] <kerx__> Will .serialize() provide  a=1&b=1 style?
[12:35:37] <Eviltwin> Yes
[12:35:54] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[12:36:02] <kerx__> And it will handle weird characters?
[12:36:04] <kerx__> In the form
[12:36:24] <Eviltwin> Yes...
[12:36:47] <kerx__> Okay, now I just have to figure out what I will use to pass in unknown form data
[12:36:49] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure what libraries you've worked with in the past, but jQuery doesn
[12:36:49] <kerx__> And how to handle that
[12:36:53] <Eviltwin> 't like to put asterisks on things
[12:37:00] <_cb> on $("#myId").mouseover(function(){.... how do I reference the element that generated the event?
[12:37:03] <Eviltwin> "This only works if it's an ascii string" etc
[12:37:26] <Eviltwin> _cb: You do $("#myId").mouseover(function(event) { ... })
[12:37:29] <Eviltwin> And reference event.target
[12:37:39] <kerx__> Eviltwin is it okay to PM you?
[12:37:50] <Eviltwin> kerx__: We generally prefer to keep conversation in here
[12:37:53] <Eviltwin> So that others can contribute
[12:38:03] <Eviltwin> And I may be stepping out any moment
[12:38:06] <kerx__> Ok
[12:39:14] <_cb> Eviltwin lets assume I want to change the color of the div on mousever inside function(event){...} how do I reference the div? Is there something like $this or other way of doing it?
[12:39:29] <Eviltwin> "this"
[12:40:00] <ajpiano> _cb: $(this) and $(event.target) are identical
[12:40:08] <ajpiano> in a typical jQuery event
[12:40:22] <_cb> ok, great to know. Thanks!
[12:40:25] <Eviltwin> What about bubbling?
[12:41:18] <ajpiano> true enough
[12:41:37] <ajpiano> sometimes it's a matter of picking between whether to teach a man to fish and teaching a man how to do advanced fly fishing techniques
[12:41:39] <ajpiano> ;)
[12:43:24] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/Qj4fL/
[12:44:19] <Eviltwin> _cb: Might want to take a look at that ^
[12:44:21] <Eviltwin> Could be relevant
[12:44:37] <thomedy> http://pastebin.com/srzRV8zm
[12:44:43] <_cb> thanks Eviltwin
[12:44:49] <thomedy> does this look right
[12:45:27] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: but if you do $("foo").on("event", "bar", fn) the 'this' gets set to 'bar', not 'foo'
[12:45:46] <ajpiano> so yeah agin it really goes back tot he point of people being able to find out what 'this' is
[12:45:47] <Eviltwin> Yes
[12:46:00] <Eviltwin> Well I think it still makes sense there
[12:46:05] <Eviltwin> "this" is the element matched by the selector
[12:46:17] <Eviltwin> In this case the selector is two-part
[12:46:24] <Eviltwin> The static "foo" and the dynamic "bar"
[12:46:30] <ajpiano> intersting perspective
[12:46:53] <Eviltwin> Children of bar will still trigger that if the event bubbles
[12:47:05] <Eviltwin> And the event target will represent that child while this still represents bar
[12:47:17] <ajpiano> i think of $("#foo").on("event", ".bar", fn) as just a shortcut to $("#foo").on("event", function(e) { if ( $(e.target).is(".bar") ) { } });
[12:47:24] <ajpiano> good ol' fashioned event delegation that way :p
[12:47:30] <Eviltwin> Ah, I think it's an important distinction
[12:47:43] <MoTiOnXml> anyone experienced with XML sitemaps?
[12:47:55] <MoTiOnXml> just wondering .. even if it's #jquery
[12:48:30] <imsky> sure mayne
[12:48:33] <imsky> i got tons of experience
[12:48:46] <MoTiOnXml> imsky: allright, -> priv.
[13:08:07] <thomedy> i figured out what my problem was
[13:08:08] <thomedy> nothing
[13:08:22] <thomedy> i just am still learning what stuff does and how bubbling works
[13:08:40] <thomedy> so i was expecting the div to replace itself... and then replace itself again in the new version
[13:08:48] <thomedy> but it always finds the newest version
[13:09:08] <thomedy> so im goign to try to remove all body elements butthe new one
[13:09:15] <MoTiOnXml> frisky radio on shoutcast just keeps going and going .. recommended for tech house :)
[13:13:34] <imsky> ooh tech house
[13:15:25] <imsky> MoTiOnXml, i'm playing the same thing on repeat here
[13:19:48] <thomedy> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[13:19:51] <thomedy> i m reading this
[13:20:05] <thomedy> and i have an idea to utilize attr to do what im doing
[13:20:13] <thomedy> but i need to remove all elements but one
[13:20:32] <thomedy> i dont see a ! for straight selectors
[13:20:41] <imsky> hey, my selector is straight
[13:20:46] <ravenzz> :d
[13:21:10] <ravenzz> thomedy use the filter() funcion
[13:21:14] <ravenzz> +t
[13:21:15] <imsky> $("div").not(":even") thomedy
[13:21:18] <ravenzz> or not
[13:33:14] <ArtificialEX> hey do you think there is a way to fix jquery tools calendar's absoslut positioning problem? when you resize browser it moves
[13:33:17] <ArtificialEX> http://www.jquerytools.org/demos/dateinput/static.html
[13:33:36] <ArtificialEX> if it happens on their own website, im not even sure its worth trying to fix
[13:35:55] <ArtificialEX> damn maybe i shoulda switched to jqueryUI before I edited the heck out of it
[13:40:37] <ArtificialEX> can i use jquery to move one element from child of <divA> to <divB> ?
[13:41:08] <systemfault> ArtificialEX: Yeahâ€¦ see .remove and .detach
[13:42:36] <ArtificialEX> ok, does this sound like a right way to do this?
[13:42:39] <ArtificialEX> www.fbignite.com
[13:42:50] <ArtificialEX> you can see the calendar is the last thing in <body>, with absolute positioning
[13:43:08] <ArtificialEX> im going to reattatch it to #calendar
[13:43:35] <systemfault> ArtificialEX: The guy who did this website is weird...
[13:44:03] <systemfault> ArtificialEX: I'm not sure why would anyone use absolute positioning in that situation..
[13:45:41] <tw2113> absolutely position selectively :)
[13:53:32] <thomedy> i have $(*).not('#mydiv').remove()
[13:53:38] <thomedy> but im getting a syntax error
[13:54:54] <thomasmyrman> try: $('*')
[13:56:37] <ArtificialEX>  systemfault, went afk, but you mean the guy who did jquery tools is wierd?
[13:57:12] <ArtificialEX> because jquery tools the datepicker absolutely, even on their own website it breaks
[13:57:22] <systemfault> ArtificialEX: Nah, he probably had position absolute on his calendar because he wanted it to be a popup
[13:57:53] <ArtificialEX> who? http://www.jquerytools.org/demos/dateinput/static.html
[13:58:25] <ArtificialEX> the way jquery tools loads the static calendar is absolutely, at the bottom, doing a quick calculation of the screen
[13:58:32] <ArtificialEX> but if you resize it breaks, even on their site
[13:58:45] <systemfault> ArtificialEX: It's made to be a "popup"
[13:59:11] <systemfault> ArtificialEX: A classic date picker
[13:59:28] <ArtificialEX> im not sure why its titled Calendar that is always available
[13:59:38] <ArtificialEX> "Now you can build applications where the calendar is a core part of the user interface."
[14:00:27] <systemfault> ArtificialEX: Have you done what is written in the "HTML layout" section?
[14:01:08] <ArtificialEX> yeah but it does not position the calendar in the #calendar contain, which would make a lot of sense
[14:01:11] <ArtificialEX> not even in their example
[14:01:46] <systemfault> Seems that you can't do anything :/
[14:02:28] <systemfault> Except perhapsâ€¦ move it into some container orâ€¦ reposition it yourself every X milliseconds
[14:02:31] <ArtificialEX> systemfault: is the detatch replace jquery stuff messy?
[14:02:50] <ArtificialEX> i mean is that an efficient way of just moving the entire thing to the #calendar container
[14:02:58] <systemfault> ArtificialEX: Usually, no but it might be possible that the CSS could be affected..
[14:03:11] <systemfault> ArtificialEX: Yeah, it is.
[14:03:12] <ArtificialEX> ok thanks, ill give it a shot
[14:03:30] <systemfault> ArtificialEX: You might need a position: relative on your container to make it possible
[14:04:09] <ArtificialEX> yeah your right i will
[14:04:11] <ArtificialEX> i hope its this easy $('#myDiv2').append( $('#myDiv1>p') );
[14:10:04] <ArtificialEX> that was awesome systemfault, it works perfect. and im glad becuase jquery tools is a lot lighter than jqueryui... funny bug tho, should submit it
[14:10:05] <ArtificialEX> thanks a bunch
[14:10:47] <systemfault> I hate jqueryui :P
[14:10:52] <systemfault> ArtificialEX: You're welcome :D
[14:11:54] <ArtificialEX> yeah everything else about jquery tools has been super quick and convenient, tooltips modals etc
[14:25:05] <thomedy595> you know i thought i had a great idea but i am having a hard time with it...
[14:35:10] <thomedy595> alright time to go to work but i got it
[14:35:13] <thomedy595> hell to the yeah
[14:35:31] <thomedy595> sweet i dont know why i was trying to be complicated when i should have been appending the whole time
[14:48:35] <orangey> hmm. does formatItem no longer work?
[14:48:44] <orangey> for autocomplete? I don't see it in any official jquery docs
[14:49:31] <orangey> Here's the code I'm trying: http://pastebin.com/pQyWX5sq
[14:55:16] <rodyhaddad> Hey, does anyone know how getScript works? it appears as an XHR in chrome's developers tool, and I don't think jQuery actually ajax it and does something like eval...
[14:55:47] <ravenzz> did you read the documentation?
[14:55:58] <ravenzz> it is explained in there actually
[14:58:28] <rodyhaddad> ravenzz, I just did, and not, it doesn't (unless I'm missing something?)
[14:59:01] <ravenzz> it is a shorthand ajax function
[14:59:14] <ravenzz> where the dataType is setted to script
[14:59:24] <rodyhaddad> ok, jquery gets the script using ajax, but how does it execute it?
[14:59:51] <ofcan> can someone please help? I am using ajax with jquery post method and cant get past the error 400 > here is the question in detail...http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10656860/change-attribute-using-checkbox-ajax-jquery > the answer I have taken is the one by 'filipe abreu'
[15:12:20] <ravenzz> rodyhaddad it is executed automatically
[15:13:23] <rodyhaddad> ravenzz, how? :P eval? or create a new script and append it from the DOM? (then remove it)
[15:13:35] <ravenzz> using the globalEval method i guess
[15:14:26] <ravenzz> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.2.js line 608
[15:16:13] <rodyhaddad> ravenzz, thx :), that was what I was looking for
[15:16:50] <ravenzz> yw
[15:20:09] <ofcan> I wrote the question about ajax here, please help > http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10669241/bad-request-bad-uri-object20object
[15:22:17] <ravenzz> ofcan have you tried to debug $('#task_completed').closest('form').attr('action') ?
[15:23:52] <ofcan> ravenzz: how to do that?
[15:24:13] <ravenzz> is your template generating the correct one? I mean have you tried to inspect the form and see what is its action value?
[15:25:14] <ofcan> ravenzz: you mean check the source?
[15:25:34] <ravenzz> ofcan $('#task_completed').change('change', function(){ console.debug($(this).closest('form').attr('action')) });
[15:25:35] <ravenzz> yes
[15:25:45] <ravenzz> lul
[15:25:53] <ravenzz> that's wrong sorry
[15:26:03] <ravenzz> $('#task_completed').change(function(){ console.debug($(this).closest('form').attr('action')) })
[15:27:01] <ofcan> ravenzz: ok, 1 sec :)
[15:28:52] <TomWij> ofcan: Answered.
[15:33:55] <TomWij> Wait, since when is undefined seen as an object?
[15:34:11] <ravenzz> eh
[15:34:49] <ofcan> TomWij: yeah... why is that undefined?
[15:35:05] <TomWij> ofcan: Did you put that inside the bind function?
[15:36:04] <ofcan> TomWij: ok, inside bind action returns as expected > projects/1/tasks/4
[15:36:16] <ofcan> TomWij: at 1st I've put it outside...
[15:37:27] <TomWij> Wait. You're getting 4 now.
[15:37:47] <TomWij> $('#task_completed').bind 'change', (event) => window.alert($('#task_completed').closest('form').attr('action'))
[15:37:52] <TomWij> gives you a /4 at the end
[15:38:04] <TomWij> $('#task_completed').bind 'change', (event) => url = $('#task_completed').closest('form').attr('action')
[15:38:28] <TomWij> gives you a request that ends with /[object%20Object]
[15:38:32] <TomWij> That's just weird... :/
[15:38:47] <ofcan> TomWij: yup. creepy as hell
[15:39:19] <TomWij> What if you do window.alert(url); right under the URL, ofcan?
[15:40:20] <ofcan> TomWij: same > projects/1/tasks/4
[15:40:33] <TomWij> So, did you try removing the data parts already?
[15:40:49] <ofcan> TomWij: yup, and adding a comma...
[15:41:02] <TomWij> Where are you getting the error from?
[15:41:45] <ofcan> TomWij: in chrome inspect element > network
[15:42:01] <ofcan> TomWij: says also bad request 400
[15:43:00] <TomWij> Is the site online somewhere?
[15:43:24] <ofcan> TomWij: nope, but its on bitbucket :)
[15:44:15] <ofcan> TomWij: do i have to have some code in the controller regarding ajax?
[15:44:32] <ravenzz> 1st why don't you use $(this) instead of $('#task_completed') ?
[15:44:57] <ofcan> ravenzz: works funny with coffeescript. I'll refactor when I get this working
[15:45:35] <ravenzz> var_dump the values you get from the ajax form and die
[15:45:38] <ravenzz> in your controller
[15:45:49] <ravenzz> and take a look at the network tab
[15:45:53] <ravenzz> of the dev tools
[15:46:25] <TomWij> He did, that's where the error is from.
[15:46:32] <ravenzz> ah ok
[15:46:53] <TomWij> ofcan: How exactly does it work funny? I just see $(this) be translated to $(this) in the resulting js.
[15:47:30] <ravenzz> is the value correct within the change handler function ?
[15:48:10] <ofcan> TomWij: :) ok, I'll rewrite it. While I was experimenting with this stuff, I was afraid of ambiguation so I specified it like that
[15:49:40] <ofcan> can I handle that with jquery .submit() somehow? to avoid all this $.post()?
[15:49:41] <_cb> $("#id_thumbctr").on("mouseover",function(event){alert($(this).offsetTop);});  id_thumbctr is a div. why does the alert give me an undefined?
[15:50:07] <TomWij> Check the resulting code when in doubt, you can type a lot of JS syntax in CoffeeScript without a problem. ?: doesn't work though xD
[15:51:22] <ofcan> TomWij: I've tried this , but nothing happened also... :( https://gist.github.com/220156452f17d4d55ac0
[15:51:54] <ofcan> you guys have any similar ajax code I can maybe try to apply to my situation?
[15:51:58] <TomWij> Did you mean to ping raven?
[15:52:49] <ofcan> TomWij: ment you and him both :)
[15:53:37] <TomWij> _cb: Apparently it has to be this in that case.
[15:53:49] <TomWij> But doesn't explain why $('#task_completed') doesn't work.
[15:53:57] <ravenzz> _cb $(this) is a jQuery object
[15:54:13] <ravenzz> and you don't have any offsetTop property for it
[15:54:31] <ravenzz> ?offset @ _cb
[15:54:31] <bot-t> _cb, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[15:56:46] <_cb> Any way to use the $ syntax ie since this is a div any way i can do $(..).attrib('myAttr') ?
[15:59:04] <_cb> <div id ='myDiv' myAttr='test'></div> how do I read myAttr on a mouseover event?
[15:59:34] <TomWij> _cb: Your code but use this. instead of $(this).
[15:59:48] <TomWij> Or...
[15:59:59] <TomWij> Use $(this).attr('myAttr')
[16:02:40] <_cb> ok that worked. Thanks!
[16:38:33] <thorie> how can i check if any input has focus anywhere? i know i can check individual elements with $('#something').is(':focus'); but i want to check that ALL don't have focus (before i capture a keypress)
[16:40:30] <Whirl3d> Good evening. I have done this before, but can't remember exactly how...how do I create a proxy for jquery that works the way that I want with regards to selection criteria:  for example: $$=function () {var res=$(arguments); if res.length==0 return undefined; return res;}....will my $$ function maintain chainability if the resultant collection has more than 0 elements?
[16:41:22] <Whirl3d> thorie, check for $(":focus").length
[16:42:50] <thorie> thanks Whirl3d
[16:43:02] <Whirl3d> np
[16:44:21] <rgr> how do I reference the element itself in a jquery command chain e.g in $(".myclass").removeClass("delclass").html( myFunc(contents of element)) , "contents of element" might be el.html().
[16:44:45] <thorie> works great
[16:45:19] <Whirl3d> rgr, that should work
[16:45:31] <rgr> What should work?
[16:45:37] <Whirl3d> el.html();
[16:45:50] <rgr> el isnt defined, that was an example of what I want to do.
[16:46:05] <rgr> el in this case is the element being processed.
[16:46:24] <Whirl3d> is the element being processed referenced by a variable name?
[16:46:35] <Whirl3d> or how are you referening it?
[16:46:43] <rgr> no. the element is the element being processed by the selector. I'm not being too clear I know...
[16:47:03] <Whirl3d> so, it's an instance of ".myClass" then
[16:47:46] <rgr> yes I want to pass its html() (in this example) back in after having processed it with myFunc. Aargh. Its late and my terminology is all over the place.
[16:47:54] <Whirl3d> I think you are going to need to use .each to get what you want
[16:48:00] <rgr> aha ok thanks
[16:48:45] <Whirl3d> $(".myClass").each(function () {var el=$(this); el.removeClass("delclass").html(myFunc(el.html()))});
[16:49:35] <Whirl3d> some peculiar combination of }) that I probably got wrong, but that gives you the idea. When inside the .each function, you can refer to the element being processed as "this" or if you want the jquery goodness with it use $(this)
[16:49:44] <rgr> yes, I see exactly what I wanted thanks.
[16:49:53] <Whirl3d> np
[17:07:18] <Whirl3d> by applying a second argument to the jquery selector parameters, you could supply context. How would I overrid ethe default behavior to look for a boolean context...if true, not defined, or selector, operate as normal, but if false, then return undefined on 0 length results?
[17:10:17] <shoky_> function $$$(selector, context) {  if (context === false) .........etc }
[17:11:31] <Whirl3d> but I need it to work for $.find() for example.
[17:11:35] <Whirl3d> or filter
[17:11:37] <Whirl3d> or ...
[17:12:22] <Whirl3d> or even .each would be useful
[17:12:59] <Whirl3d> wherever a "selection" happens, it would be nice to have the option to override the default behavior and return undefined if no elements were selected.
[17:13:33] <shoky_> but then you can't chain safely
[17:13:57] <Whirl3d> I'm unable to chain safely as it is because I keep having to make the selection and check if it's empty
[17:14:38] <Whirl3d> as soon as I drop out of the chain to ensure that I got the item I am selecting for, it is in my benefit to have received undefined
[17:15:10] <Whirl3d> because thenI could use the syntax $$(element)||$$(otherElement), for example
[17:16:52] <Whirl3d> I still believe that jquery is doing the right thing by maintaining the chain when selecting elements with 0 results, but I would like the option to override that inline.
[17:18:53] <shoky_> well, right now i cant think of a simple way to do that that'd work for $() AND .find AND .filter  .. just overriding each
[17:19:20] <shoky_> cause that means adding an argument to the method's semantics, an argument that wasn't there before
[17:19:35] <Whirl3d> except that it is there...
[17:19:38] <Whirl3d> it's just context now
[17:19:39] <shoky_> only in $()
[17:19:42] <shoky_> not in .find
[17:19:43] <shoky_> or .filter
[17:20:05] <Whirl3d> oh, I thought you could apply context to those elements as well. I guess they have context already...duh!
[17:20:12] <shoky_> ;P
[17:20:51] <shoky_> and if you want find and filter you'll also want .children , .parents, .closest, .nextAll etc etc etc ;P
[17:21:19] <shoky_> i think adding a check for .length  each time you need to is simpler :P
[17:21:57] <Whirl3d> I have seen some folks write some weird code where they use strange conditionals to start ...something like condition1?function():function()    but it always looks weird to me. Do you know what I am talking about.
[17:23:00] <Whirl3d> where I am used to seeing var a=b?c:d;   but this skips the a= part and instead of c and d being values, they are methods
[17:25:00] <Whirl3d> Yeah, for now I have just extended jquery to include a bunch of methods that return undefined by default like: $.fn.$find()  or $.fn.$each()   it works pretty well and saves tons of conditional lines in my code
[17:29:45] <Whirl3d> what about an .else method? That might even be better. Something that checks to see if this.length==0 and only executes is true...
[17:31:37] <shoky_> could work i suppose
[17:31:49] <shoky_> bbs
[17:33:15] <Whirl3d> $.fn.else=function () {if (this.length==0) return $(arguments);}
[17:34:28] <shoky_> arguments?
[17:34:48] <brettfrable> need some help with modernizr
[17:34:56] <Whirl3d> $.fn.else=function () {return this.length?this:$(arguments);}
[17:35:03] <Whirl3d> arguments, for the function
[17:35:19] <shoky_> yeah, but how would you use that
[17:35:40] <shoky_> i thought you wanted to run a callback if length=0
[17:35:41] <shoky_> ==
[17:36:07] <Whirl3d> var thumbHolder=$(".thumbHolder").else ("<div/>",{class:"thumbHolder});
[17:36:19] <shoky_> oh
[17:37:16] <shoky_> no arguments here ;P
[17:37:35] <shoky_> of mine, that is. not function arguments
[17:38:01] <Whirl3d> or even var elem=$(elem1).else(elem2)    since if both exist, $(elem1,elem2) would return both
[17:38:18] <Whirl3d> i got that btw. lol 8)
[17:40:48] <shoky_> heh
[17:40:54] <shoky_> else is a reserved word ;P
[17:40:59] <Whirl3d> or even better yet:  $.fn.else=function () {if (this.length) return this; if $.isFunction(arguments[0]) {arguments[0].call(Array.prototype.slice.apply(arguments,1));} return $(arguments);
[17:41:10] <Whirl3d> drats
[17:41:45] <shoky_> actually donno if that matters
[17:41:51] <systemfault> Hmm
[17:42:04] <systemfault> Not sure if I like the "else" word though...
[17:42:07] <systemfault> Perhaps .or ?
[17:42:19] <Whirl3d> .or could work ...or .xor
[17:42:21] <anusx4> otherwise!
[17:43:05] <Whirl3d> or seems inclusive
[17:43:26] <shoky_> $.fn.||
[17:43:32] <anusx4> $(elem1).ormaybe(elem2)
[17:43:37] <Whirl3d> lol
[17:43:48] <Whirl3d> can you do $.fn.||? that would rock.
[17:43:51] <shoky_> nah :)
[17:43:51] <systemfault> or is better imho because it mimics ||
[17:44:00] <shoky_> yeah but it doesn't look at all like ||
[17:44:08] <ajpiano> better yet
[17:44:11] <systemfault> Whirl3d: Nah.. only $.fn.['||'] i guess :P
[17:44:13] <shoky_> ho
[17:44:14] <ajpiano> stop writing apps where you have crazy conditional selections
[17:44:25] <ajpiano> where it acts one way sometimes and another way another times
[17:44:40] <Whirl3d> That's not my case, but I hear ya.
[17:47:24] <Whirl3d> so, then you would suggest writing a method that creates an element if it doesn't exist and always calling that new method when you conditionally want the element indicated or at least a new element if it doesnt?
[17:48:28] <Whirl3d> var contentHolder = $$("#" + series) || $("<div class='seriesContent' id='" + series + "' ></div>").appendTo(panel);
[17:48:52] <Whirl3d> gives me the contentHolder div if I have to create it or if it already exists.
[17:49:09] <Whirl3d> I'm open to a better suggestion.
[17:49:55] <Whirl3d> btw, $$=function () {var res=$(arguments); return res?res:undefined;}
[17:50:06] <Whirl3d> *res.length
[17:51:16] <Eviltwin> $("#"+series).add("<div...>").first().appendTo(panel) ?
[17:52:19] <Whirl3d> presumably, $("#"+series) is already in panel
[17:53:19] <HarryPitfall> "return res?:undefined;" isn't enough?
[17:53:20] <Whirl3d> so, for the majority of the time, your method would reappend it to the panel?
[17:53:28] <HarryPitfall> since you want some crypt code
[17:53:35] <Whirl3d> res.length
[17:53:56] <Whirl3d> beause jquery returns a 0 length collection to maintain chainability
[17:54:06] <HarryPitfall> or just return $(arguments)?:undefined;
[17:54:15] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Yeah, it's not more performant, it just doesn't require anything extra
[17:54:34] <HarryPitfall> didn't remember is ecmascript accept this
[17:54:35] <Whirl3d> $(arguments) will always return a jQuery object...even if 0
[17:54:38] <HarryPitfall> if
[17:56:29] <Eviltwin> This will probably yield the best performance: var contentHolder = $("#" + series); if(!contentHolder.length) contentHolder = $("<div class='seriesContent' id='" + series + "'></div>").appendTo(panel);
[17:57:06] <Whirl3d> I like my solution for the most part. But I would like to be able to use the same notion elsewhere without also extending other methods. Like var thumbHolder=contentHolder.find(".thumbHolder"); if (!thumbHolder.length) thumbHolder=$("<div class='thumbHolder'/>").appendTo (contentHolder);
[17:57:18] <Whirl3d> lol
[17:57:43] <Whirl3d> why is that better than my solution? and how could we test it?
[18:01:46] <Whirl3d> The only problem I have with my solution is that I have to also have $.fn.$find() which basically is the same patch applied to find:  $.fn.$find=function () {var res=this.find(arguments); return res.length?res:undefined;}
[18:21:55] <luvmyh0nda> Hello, I am wondering how I can manipulate the debris created by the explode effect.
[18:28:18] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i try this: $(ttt).animate({paddingRight:parseInt(getPaddingRight())}, 500);   but my div with id ttt doesn't move... getPaddingRIght gets the current padding and adds 10 ... What can be the mistake?
[18:34:54] <Dr-Bombay> assign getPaddingRight() and parseInt(getPaddingRight()) to variables so that you can see what they are
[18:36:17] <Krambiorix> Dr-Bombay, they are empty
[18:37:32] <Klevre> Anyone here who uses the jquery validation plugin?
[18:37:36] <Dr-Bombay> that sounds like a problem you need to investigate
[18:39:01] <Dr-Bombay> is ttt a variable in your code?
[18:39:14] <Dr-Bombay> if so, how are you setting it
[18:41:58] <Krambiorix> Dr-Bombay, ok now it works but i have to set the padding on the table in the div...
[18:42:41] <Krambiorix> Dr-Bombay, i set the paddingRight to 100 and the table goes to the right... If paddingRIght is 100 , the table should move to the left, no?
[18:46:44] <Dr-Bombay> no idea what you are talking about
[19:02:12] <Dr-Bombay> h0nda: even if you can get the elements, I doubt that you can do anything useful with them because they are under the effect's control the whole time
[19:03:57] <Dr-Bombay> also it's not a very good effect imo
[19:10:28] <aphid> do it like this :P http://craftymind.com/factory/html5video/CanvasVideo.html
[19:17:16] <luvmyh0nda> Dr-Bombay: any ideas for a firework-type easing/effect/animation, or where I would start?
[19:19:22] <luvmyh0nda> aphid: dude thats pretty cool, unfortunately it has to be cross-browser compat.
[19:19:55] <aphid> i think that works in anythign with <canvas> support
[19:21:16] <luvmyh0nda> no ie9 support, safari, but opera and ff work
[19:21:45] <luvmyh0nda> forsure bookmarking for the future though
[19:40:49] <Tekth> Hi, Im using appendto() using animation with opacity change to show hidden divs on my page. But for some reason the effect only works the very first time each div is shown
[19:48:21] <Tekth> http://jsfiddle.net/uEtSX/11/
[20:39:10] <oojacoboo> hey guys, if I'm on a certain page and I need to force an http request with a url like thisâ€¦ /foo#/whatever?id=123   how can I go about this?
[20:39:25] <oojacoboo> it works so long as I am not on /foo currently
[20:39:50] <oojacoboo> if I'm on foo it just appends the url but doesn't send the request, obviously, b/c of the hash
[20:40:17] <oojacoboo> but this is an undesired response
[20:44:04] <oojacoboo> I'm thinking about using some mod_rewrite for this, there has to be a better method ><
[20:48:09] <aphid> oojacoboo: well, it's going to try and use the fragment identifier
[20:48:18] <aphid> why would you break that?
[20:48:22] <oojacoboo> aphid, yes, I realize that
[20:48:38] <oojacoboo> I just rewrote it though
[20:48:46] <oojacoboo> add a new /load/ for urls
[20:49:31] <oojacoboo> it throws that url, b/c no page will ever be sitting there, it causes an http forced load, then that url rewrites, stripping itself and replacing with everything after
[20:50:17] <oojacoboo> it's certainly not perfect, I'd prefer to put in some js that causes the browser to always load any changes to the url
[20:52:43] <oojacoboo> anyone know how to bind to that event?
[20:52:58] <oojacoboo> window.onhashchange
[21:09:09] <lenswipe> hye ugys
[21:09:09] <lenswipe> guys*
[21:09:11] <lenswipe> whos around?
[21:10:30] <Tekth> yo
[21:11:04] <lenswipe> sup
[21:11:16] <lenswipe> Tekth, do you know a way to append arbitary data to a form using jquery on submit?
[21:11:20] <lenswipe> oh and im not using AJAX
[21:11:23] <lenswipe> its just a normal post
[21:12:19] <systemfault> lenswipe: You add hidden fields to the form
[21:12:24] <systemfault> On submit
[21:12:34] <lenswipe> systemfault, ...ic
[21:12:40] <lenswipe> will they be posted with the form?
[21:13:11] <systemfault> lenswipe: Yes
[21:13:50] <lenswipe> cool :)
[21:14:14] <lenswipe> systemfault, my web app is set to compress minify the HTML which screws <textarea> up
[21:14:19] <lenswipe> but i still want to use multi-line text
[21:14:25] <lenswipe> so im using editable divs
[21:26:52] <lenswipe> systemfault, im using if($('form').find($(this).attr('name')).length <= 0){ to check to make sure that the element is only added once
[21:26:58] <lenswipe> systemfault, thats not working - any ideas why?
[21:27:40] <systemfault> lenswipe: Do you think you can find nodes with a specific name by doing that?
[21:27:52] <lenswipe> thats what im trying to do
[21:28:08] <lenswipe> only create node "foo" if it doesnt already exist
[21:28:10] <systemfault> $('[name="whatever"]')
[21:28:19] <systemfault> That would find all nodes with name = whatever
[21:28:21] <lenswipe> k
[21:28:42] <systemfault> Soâ€¦ now I guess that you have an idea why your .find doesn't work
[21:29:08] <lenswipe> there is one small thing
[21:29:24] <lenswipe> my <div>s have the same name as the hidden feilds
[21:29:29] <lenswipe> (for obvious reasons)
[21:31:15] <Whirl3d> If I create an anchorelement in jquery and wrap it around an image element, does my context change? $("<a></a>").wrap(img).hide();   will hide be the image or the anchor?
[21:32:55] <Whirl3d> nvm I thought it would be a quick answer. I'll tias.
[21:45:13] <Pr3fix> hey guys, im new to jquery and right now I'm trying to create a new div element, inside that div element create an image with a src attribute, and then append the DIV (with the img inside) to an ID  in the DOM. This is what I have so far; any suggestions? $("<div/>").("<img/>").attr("src", src).appendTo("#slider1");
[21:52:08] <anusx4> Pr3fix: I'd just do it in two lines.  var $img = $("<img/").attr("src",src); var $div = $("<div></div>").append($img).appendTo("#slider1");
[21:52:51] <Pr3fix> anusx4: thanks for the reply (never thought someone named anusx4 would be helping me out :b )
[21:53:14] <Pr3fix> so that will create a div element, create an img element inside it and then append the div to the DOM? trying to learn jquery but it's messing with my brain, heh
[21:54:11] <anusx4> specifically, it will create an img element, then create a div element.  the img element will be appended to the div, then the div will be finally be appended to the DOM in #slider1
[21:54:22] <anusx4> until that last step, it's not actually in the DOM
[21:54:35] <Pr3fix> excellent, I get it now :)
[21:54:36] <Pr3fix> thank you!
[21:54:40] <anusx4> np
[21:55:12] <anusx4> I like to $ on jquery-type object vars to distinguish them.
[22:11:52] <Carlitta87> how do i allow a div to shrink depending on the screen size as well as position itself in a particular position.... i dont necessarily need a step by step... but a lil guidance as to wat to look for or even a link to ready on....i need the help...thanks in advance
[22:28:27] <thorie> are you familiar with fluid widths
[23:00:16] <Whirl3d> blech. I hate it when people use the hungarian notation for jquery variables. Too difficult to decode with a bunch of extra $ around.
[23:01:08] <Whirl3d> Carlitta87, you might want to ask the folks at #css. They could give you all kinds of advice.
[23:02:17] <aniasis> why would $el.width return 0 even though there is a width for the element?
[23:02:44] <aniasis> and $el.outerWidth(true) return the margin but not the width of the element
[23:03:11] <anusx4> while I despise hungarian notation in general, I find it okay with dollar signs because they don't interfere with the variable name in my mind, they just modify it.  I guess cause I spent so much time with perl and php, those things don't bother me.
[23:03:54] <snover> $ isnâ€™t hungarian notation :)
[23:04:21] <Whirl3d> what is it if it's not hungarian (when used to indicate a jquery collection)
[23:04:23] <anusx4> it kinda is, isn't it?  It's prefixing the identnfier with the type
[23:04:38] <aniasis> ?
[23:04:48] <aniasis> umm no
[23:05:08] <aniasis> what is the type?
[23:05:16] <Whirl3d> jquery collection
[23:05:22] <snover> I meant perl/php $
[23:05:25] <snover> sigils
[23:05:36] <anusx4> aniasis: we're gaving a different conversation, but you happened to use the same notation when you came in
[23:05:50] <anusx4> snover: yeah, it's just part of the language there
[23:06:10] <anusx4> anyway I don't know, aniasis.
[23:06:14] <aniasis> But $ doesn't denote a jQuery object outside the use of the library
[23:06:53] <Whirl3d> It just makes it hard to read when you have nothing more than a . to separate your methods from your variable names.
[23:07:44] <anusx4> I don't disagree but have a hard time mustering up strong feelings about readbaility of a single character.  to each his own.
[23:08:04] <anusx4> it's not liek we're talking about literate cobol vs. brainfuck here. I can go either way
[23:08:52] <snover> hahaha
[23:08:54] <Whirl3d> Oh, yeah. I wasn't upset or anything. It's not a big deal. LOL
[23:09:03] <anusx4> wiki simply says "the name of a variable or function indicates its type or intended use."
[23:09:05] <snover> anusx4 you are an enigma.
[23:09:11] <anusx4> so I would argue that usin the $ for jquery is definitely hungarian
[23:10:02] <anusx4> in fact in perl I might even argue the $ is hungarian-ISH.
[23:10:40] <snover> apps hungarian perhaps
[23:11:13] <anusx4> yeah
[23:11:40] <anusx4> at work all our database schemas use apps hungarian, it kills me.
[23:11:44] <snover> not nearly as useful as four anuses
[23:12:06] <anusx4> Fine, I can see that on the field names, if you subscribe to that philosophy.  But we have a table called tblUsers.  As if the table could be something other than a table
[23:13:10] <anusx4> yeah that's about two too many if you know what I mean.  Imma rent the extras out
[23:13:19] <snover> you just have to think big
[23:13:21] <snover> and by big
[23:13:21] <snover> I mean
[23:13:25] <snover> numerous
[23:14:19] <snover> with that many, you could fit at least one bag of dicks probably
[23:14:25] <anusx4> anyone lose money on facebook's IPO? that was fun
[23:15:08] <anusx4> what a mess
[23:15:16] <anusx4> I wasn't dumb enough to buy FB but I thought I could make money by proxy with Zynga.  NOPE.
[23:15:30] <snover> hahahawww.
[23:15:51] <snover> clearly the smart play was to invest in myspace
[23:16:07] <anusx4> I just didnt have that kind of foresight.
[23:26:36] <tw2113> i had bills to pay, so no money to invest in a website
[23:28:37] <anusx4> just take out loans for that
[23:30:28] <Lucky--> question how come i am calling var str = $("#zip").val; and getting that str is equal to some anonymous function instead of its value?
[23:30:32] <tw2113> loans for bills? please
[23:30:42] <Lucky--> loans for bills?
[23:30:44] <Lucky--> who needs one
[23:31:10] <Lucky--> i actually own a lending network lol
[23:31:19] <anusx4> Lucky--: .val() not .val
[23:31:29] <Lucky--> gotcha lol
[23:31:36] <anusx4> tw2113: no loans for wall street gambles
[23:32:27] <anusx4> you pay the loans off with your earnings
[23:32:33] <anusx4> this is investing 101
[23:32:46] <tw2113> i'm the 99% though
[23:32:54] <tw2113> well, i claim 98%
[23:33:01] <tw2113> i manage to pay my student loans still
[23:33:07] <Lucky--> you can be the 1% if you choose to be.
[23:33:35] <anusx4> I'm the 9% and I didn't even go 2 collij
[23:33:43] <Lucky--> it just takes axing the social brainwashing and mantras of "work hard to make a dollar, etc" out
[23:33:56] <anusx4> amen
[23:33:56] <Lucky--> or "you need to go to school to get a good job"
[23:34:06] <anusx4> bet dat
[23:34:24] <Lucky--> aka you need to go to school to learn to work to work to live to live to work.
[23:34:35] <tw2113> i went smart, i saw future in the internet, i could have gone liberal arts
[23:34:56] <anusx4> especially in our field here.  school was a lie.  maybe to be a doctor or whatever, but there's no requirement for a license to write code for a company
[23:34:56] <Lucky--> i went smart, I dropped out and started a consulting firm that I sold when I was 23.
[23:35:17] <anusx4> ditto, dropped out, made a porn video site in 2005.  money train since
[23:35:17] <Lucky--> then built tech driven lead generation firms
[23:35:32] <tw2113> i can handle 14k remaining, it's not that much
[23:35:45] <Lucky--> tw2113: what if i were to tell you I can make that in a week?
[23:35:48] <Lucky--> as a drop out
[23:35:55] <tw2113> through investments?
[23:35:59] <tw2113> i need the brains for that
[23:36:00] <Lucky--> no
[23:36:03] <Lucky--> not investments
[23:36:10] <Lucky--> and legitamately
[23:36:10] <anusx4> for only $99/yr subscription he can tell you how to do the same!
[23:36:22] <Lucky--> anusx4: bahahaha pretty much
[23:36:25] <Lucky--> my affiliate marketing days
[23:36:31] <Lucky--> educational but fun
[23:36:53] <Lucky--> the best business man is the best middle man
[23:36:56] <anusx4> affiliates are the lowest of the low.  that's why we pay them handsomely
[23:37:14] <Lucky--> anusx4: I own a subprime lending network with traffic driven by affiliates
[23:37:21] <Lucky--> and affiliate networks
[23:37:30] <anusx4> I sell sex toys
[23:37:32] <tw2113> never fully understood affiliate stuff
[23:38:01] <Lucky--> marketing, people ALWAYS need more business
[23:38:10] <Lucky--> regardless of the economy.
[23:38:31] <Lucky--> Look for a niche that needs filling, fill it, and get rich in your niche. Identify where you can provide value.
[23:38:47] <Lucky--> A business where they give you nickles, you give them back something they perceive worth a dollar
[23:38:56] <Lucky--> they will then give you ever single damn nickle they have and can find
[23:39:33] <anusx4> it's simple.  affiliates are salespeople you hire, but only pay commission to.  it's in both of your interests for them to sell your product, so they do.  they put up banners on their site, tell their friends, whatever it takes.
[23:39:46] <Lucky--> yep
[23:39:53] <Lucky--> just make sure you get lengthy nice indemnity agreements
[23:40:02] <Lucky--> and indemnify yourself
[23:40:32] <Lucky--> getting sued because of one of your affiliates isnt fun, but with a good attorney you can axe them, and use pass-through liability
[23:41:10] <anusx4> inmy industry, porn, affiliates are basement-dwelling jerks who have amassed a reputation on major sites
[23:41:24] <anusx4> and you gotta deal with them. it's funny
[23:41:45] <anusx4> only the numbers matter in the end though, pay whoever makes sales
[23:41:45] <Lucky--> oh yea for sure
[23:41:48] <Lucky--> they are the suckage
[23:42:09] <Lucky--> porn is an extremely profitable niche, just a huge amount of liability
[23:42:26] <Lucky--> whats the average CPA anus?
[23:42:57] <anusx4> I just watched a Ted talk about porn addiction and effects on the brain etc.  Made me feel things
[23:43:23] <tw2113> in which brain?
[23:43:25] <anusx4> Lucky--: we pay straight 30% commission, avg order is $105ish
[23:43:31] <anusx4> rather generous
[23:44:55] <Lucky--> about 35 ish
[23:45:01] <Lucky--> i get about 145 per app
[23:45:17] <Lucky--> do a 80(aff)/20(me) revshare with all my affiliates
[23:46:03] <anusx4> bit different, we have to manufacture and ship our stuff
[23:46:19] <Lucky--> no dropshipping or fulfillment houses?
[23:46:38] <anusx4> we are the manufacturer
