[00:00:27] <Juanlajara> no prob
[00:00:51] <soee> john-dev, thank you
[00:00:57] <john-dev> soee, sure
[00:01:43] <Mainmam> appreciate the help, guys.
[00:03:26] <DukeDrake> well .. it's not about the ajax... the ajax just makes the code 'slower' . But the main reason are the inline functions. The line of coder _after_ the inline function doesn't wait until it's finished
[00:04:31] <kingnebula> iateadonut: are you one of these people looking for a developer? :)
[00:04:48] <Hooloovoork> there are no developers here
[00:05:10] <kingnebula> ohh dear
[00:05:38] <Hooloovoork> D:
[00:06:28] <john-dev> kingnebula, you want to earn money?
[00:06:42] <kingnebula> Its a trap!
[00:06:48] <Hooloovoork> lol!
[00:06:58] <john-dev> get a job..
[00:07:13] <iateadonut> i have a great idea for a website.  if you build it for free, i'll give you 10% of the profits.
[00:07:36] <Hooloovoork> cool deal
[00:07:49] <john-dev> DukeDrake, can you show us an example?
[00:07:58] <Hooloovoork> get someone to do the job and give them a tenth of what you make from what that person made
[00:10:32] <iateadonut> oh!  now i get my joke.
[00:10:46] <kingnebula> Good. had us worried there for a second
[00:27:13] <DukeDrake> how can I check if type of $('#someinput') is 'checkbox' ?
[00:28:03] <mindis|wurk> .attr('type')
[00:28:19] <DukeDrake> tahnx
[00:28:24] <DukeDrake> *thanx
[00:31:58] <Witoman> hey all :P i have a problem
[00:32:04] <Witoman> with ui.tabs
[00:32:08] <Witoman> and 401 error
[00:32:20] <Witoman> someone could help me with that?
[00:33:02] <LukeNukem> how to make ajax support files?
[00:34:26] <DreamStiffler> ok i have this:  $(':input','#frmEntry') which targets all input tags in the frmEntry
[00:34:45] <DreamStiffler> but what i need to do is target all the input with ABC id in that form
[00:34:49] <DreamStiffler> how do i do this
[00:34:54] <Witoman> hmmm i have a problem with jQuery ui.Tabs and 402 error with access to restricted area ... any help with that?
[00:35:33] <Witoman> Dream ... try:
[00:36:14] <Witoman> $("#some_id :input").
[00:37:27] <LukeNukem> how to make ajax pass $_FILES?
[00:37:28] <LukeNukem> ??
[00:37:31] <mindis|wurk> you don't
[00:37:38] <mindis|wurk> it's not possible
[00:38:05] <LukeNukem> how will i pass it then T_T
[00:38:23] <mindis|wurk> DreamStiffler just keep in mind ids are unique so there can be only one element with a certain id ;)
[00:40:21] <Juanlajara> You can use the FormData API, but it only works in modern browsers
[00:40:46] <mindis|wurk> the whole file element system is so outdated it needs to die
[00:41:15] <mindis|wurk> probably the worst part about webdev currently
[00:42:13] <Juanlajara> lot of tricky things to make it works just fine across all browsers
[00:42:37] <mindis|wurk> simply stylizing a file element is a nightmare
[00:42:50] <DreamStiffler> mindis|wurk: its dynamic..
[00:45:46] <joshualibrarian> Soo... I know I have used name="var[]" syntax to create arrays of checkbox dom elements to pass in forms... but now with jquery when I attempt to name dom elements with [], I get a syntax error in jquery.js (line 3)!  "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [name=categories[]]"
[00:46:49] <mindis|wurk> try 'name="categories[]"]'
[00:47:14] <aro> is there a problem with having click handlers on multiple submit buttons in a form.
[00:47:14] <aro> ?
[00:48:35] <kingnebula> aro no
[00:49:46] <aro> my research suggests otherwise.. when i have multiple submit buttons on a form, it doesnt work (when using uniform js)
[00:51:11] <_ramo> hi
[00:51:14] <Juanlajara> maybe you should use on submit event handler instead of on click handler
[00:51:50] <joshualibrarian> mindis|wurk: ho!  good one, that's on the right track!
[00:51:58] <_ramo> how can i parse: "[{"name":"Toni Mega","id":"124"},{"name":"Leo Lion","id":"1234"},{"name":"Leo Item","id":"1234567"}] with jquery?
[00:52:24] <zykes> is there a way to get a dialog up without having a div ?
[00:52:39] <aqeel> sure does
[00:52:47] <aqeel> alert?
[00:52:47] <iateadonut> _ramo, use javascript, i think.
[00:53:00] <aro> Juanlajara: i am not using a click handler or anything
[00:53:01] <zykes> i'm trying $(<html here>).dialog()
[00:53:07] <zykes> but then it open multiple boxes
[00:53:10] <aro> i just have a form that is styled using uniform.js
[00:53:34] <Hooloovoork> zykes: try $("<div>", { "class": "whatever" }).html("content")
[00:53:40] <_ramo> iateadonut: but i'm not sure how
[00:53:41] <Hooloovoork> then do  .popup() on that
[00:53:44] <iateadonut> $.parseJSON(data).account_number
[00:54:06] <iateadonut> with jquery, use $.parseJSON
[00:54:14] <Juanlajara> aro: oh sorry haven't used that plugin
[00:54:17] <_ramo> iateadonut: but how to iterate through it?
[00:54:31] <zykes> Hooloovoork: what does that do ?
[00:54:34] <iateadonut> dunno
[00:55:21] <aro> is there a way to determine if the target element is a submit button?
[00:55:30] <aqeel> does jqquery have popup()???
[00:55:30] <aro> $(e.target).is("span")
[01:08:33] <aqeel> ??
[01:12:51] <aro> is there a way to determine if the target element is a submit button?
[01:14:22] <FC34> hi
[01:16:43] <mindis|wurk> hello
[01:17:11] <mindis|wurk> aro get its type information as always
[01:18:56] <FC34> i paster some code here : http://pastebin.fr/22098
[01:19:22] <FC34> but the alert in function CheckAdd return Objet Object
[01:19:33] <FC34> and i want to access to the content
[01:19:37] <FC34> how to do ?
[01:19:41] <FC34> i'm a realy beginner
[01:19:54] <DreamStiffler> i need some help for js
[01:20:05] <DreamStiffler> or jquery if it has a better solution
[01:20:29] <aqeel> ask what u need to have it done
[01:20:38] <aqeel> help with what?
[01:21:13] <DreamStiffler> this function resides in the form tag onsubmit="runthis();"
[01:21:30] <DreamStiffler> in this function i added this script at the end before closing
[01:21:32] <DreamStiffler> 	if (document.frmHeroes.HeroesList.value == "") {alert("alert!");return false;}		else {		alert("yay :" + document.frmHeroes.HeroesList.value);	}
[01:22:00] <DreamStiffler> along with the other functions...my problem is the return false doesnt work...it still loads the next page
[01:22:08] <DreamStiffler> what am i doing wrong
[01:22:54] <DreamStiffler> the alert retuned..but the next page still loads
[01:23:54] <FC34> aqeel i explaned what help i need
[01:24:39] <aqeel> ok let me see into it
[01:24:59] <DreamStiffler> please
[01:26:04] <aro> weird.. it just fails in IE9
[01:26:09] <aro> it works in IE9 w/ compatability mode
[01:27:14] <soee> in such code: $('li:not(.separator)', this) can i also somehow specify to search only for children elements ?
[01:27:46] <soee> so if inside UL -> LI there is another UL only LIs from first level are selected ?
[01:28:34] <Eviltwin> soee: Only children of "this"?
[01:28:54] <soee> Eviltwin, yes, not children of children
[01:29:29] <Eviltwin> $(this).children("li:not(.separator)"), $(this).find(">li:not(.separator)"), or $(">li:not(.separator)", this)
[01:29:36] <Eviltwin> In order of performance
[01:29:44] <FC34> aqeel any idea ?
[01:29:49] <aqeel> ul>li,ul>li>ul>li.......first level,second level
[01:29:55] <aqeel> looking
[01:30:25] <muzone> Eviltwin: the money *IS* coming
[01:30:36] <FC34> aqeel i don't understand why you are talking about ul and li. No ul or li in the http://pastebin.fr/22098
[01:30:38] <aqeel> fc34 sorry php is not my strong field
[01:30:57] <soee> Eviltwin, works fine, thank you
[01:30:59] <FC34> aqeel the php is not the issue
[01:31:05] <Eviltwin> FC34: Why are you asking PHP questions in here?
[01:31:14] <FC34> my question is not php
[01:31:22] <FC34> the php run well
[01:31:36] <Eviltwin> JavaScript operates on HTML, not PHP
[01:31:40] <FC34> by the CheckAdd use a php script
[01:31:47] <Eviltwin> When asking questions in here, please link rendered example HTML
[01:31:52] <FC34> the issue is in the CheckAdd function
[01:32:30] <FC34> Eviltwin the php return <head></head><body>resolved</body>
[01:32:30] <Eviltwin> FC34: see ?$.get
[01:32:38] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[01:32:39] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[01:32:55] <Eviltwin> Look at the examples there
[01:33:04] <FC34> i alrady read this
[01:33:13] <Eviltwin> Then you apparently didn't read it well enough
[01:33:16] <FC34> this is because i use the $('body')
[01:33:35] <FC34> can you enlight where i have to focus my attention ?
[01:33:39] <Eviltwin> Have you done asynchronous programming before?
[01:33:46] <blackspotwiggins> ?ajax101 @ FC34
[01:33:55] <blackspotwiggins> damn, where is bot
[01:33:59] <muzone> Eviltwin: the thing is though i can't work normally because i got this large tumor in the front of my brain squeezing it together, im awaiting operation
[01:34:09] <muzone> Eviltwin: im expecting some sick money thing from the state but the waiting time for my application is 2 months. today it's been exactly two months though so i should know soon
[01:34:10] <blackspotwiggins> FC34, http://fixingthesejquery.com/images/ajax101.png
[01:34:37] <FC34> blackspotwiggins i read you link
[01:34:46] <muzone> Eviltwin: (the little money i have otherwise have to go to food or my family and i will starve)
[01:34:58] <muzone> Eviltwin: like i said though it will come
[01:35:38] <blackspotwiggins> FC34, well the only thing you are doing in success callback is selecting body
[01:35:43] <blackspotwiggins> i dont know how you expect that to work
[01:35:46] <_ramo> how can i address a ul that is in a <div class="myDiv"> ? is it like  $.('.myDiv ul') ?
[01:35:50] <FC34> blackspotwiggins it is not realy clear for me. I'm not a web developer but sys admin
[01:36:14] <blackspotwiggins> FC34, so leave the webdevelopment to actual webdevs?
[01:36:42] <FC34> blackspotwiggins i just want to provide a service to users by web UI
[01:37:01] <blackspotwiggins> btw what would happen if i made a request "/php/dig.php?ip=123 && rm -rf /"
[01:37:37] <FC34> blackspotwiggins you don't have right to make rm :D
[01:37:42] <aqeel> .mydiv ul
[01:37:46] <simon> probably an HTTP error.
[01:37:50] <blackspotwiggins> you can still execute arbitrary commands
[01:38:21] <FC34> blackspotwiggins thank you to take care fo security. By this in  a controled environment
[01:38:44] <blackspotwiggins> that's what i mean by letting actual developers handle this kind of stuff.. just saying
[01:39:19] <FC34> blackspotwiggins but i agree with you. Security must handeled
[01:39:40] <FC34> my goal here in a first time is to get the html content
[01:40:29] <soee> how can i round 10,x to 10 ?
[01:40:38] <simon> floor?
[01:41:03] <soee> simon, ah yes, thank you
[01:41:10] <simon> Math.floor(10.5) == 10
[01:41:50] <aqeel> <_ramo> how can i address a ul that is in a <div class="myDiv"> ? is it like  $.('.myDiv ul') ?..................yes
[01:42:22] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/cTVWS/ - I have a sidebar with li's that collapse and expand. When they're collapsed they show arrow_right.png, when they're expanded they show arrow_down.png.
[01:42:26] <muzone> The problem is though that this only works when the li's are collapsed by default. When they're expanded by default, the script gets confused and gives it the image of collapsed li's (arrow_right.png)
[01:42:30] <muzone> How do I change the arrow image for the ones that are expanded by default? A friend gave me a quick fix - http://jsfiddle.net/cTVWS/2/ - but is there a better way to do it?
[01:42:57] <_ramo> aqeel: the next thing is: i have thi ul , i make an ajax call and get three objects back. i want to insert three <li> into this ul. http://privatepaste.com/b2039a9868/asdfsadf how should i do it?
[01:43:27] <aqeel> u can use apend or prepend
[01:43:57] <_ramo> aqeel: but how to iterate throug "data" ?
[01:44:20] <aqeel> each
[01:47:53] <aqeel> http://api.jquery.com/each/
[01:53:35] <Jopie> Using Jquery 1.7.1 in IE8 seems to hang forever in "doScrollCheck". Any ideas on what I'm doing wrong?
[01:57:08] <LukeNukem> can someone help me upload files in ajax
[01:57:17] <LukeNukem> put the info into iframe and then use php..its all confusing
[01:57:28] <mindis|wurk> quite simple really
[01:57:38] <_ramo> what's wrong here? http://privatepaste.com/e83a26cbe0/asdfsadf . console says: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ;
[01:57:42] <_ramo> i can't find the ;
[01:58:05] <LukeNukem> mindis|wurk, help me out then :>
[01:58:19] <mindis|wurk> you'll need to more specific
[01:58:52] <LukeNukem> on form submit i want the file to be uploaded
[01:58:55] <LukeNukem> im using ajax post request
[01:58:57] <blackspotwiggins> LukeNukem, use xhr2
[01:59:52] <Mumpabout> Hi, I want to make a little (read more - read less) slide toggle for a blog.
[02:00:30] <Ankabout> I've done it in 2 ways before: having 2 containers, one saying read more, one read less, and then toggling them on and off
[02:00:52] <Ankabout> or having just one container, and in the animation change the text inside
[02:00:52] <Ankabout> which is better?
[02:04:06] <Sebah> hi guys. Is somebody around here good with regex :) ?
[02:06:04] <Sebah> i have the following regex "^(http[s]?://|ftp://)?(www\.)?[a-zA-Z0-9-\.]+\.(com|org|net|mil|edu|ca|co.uk|com.au|gov)$" <- this is working fine, but obviously only if the domain name matches the specified domain extension. I'd like to match any kind of domain name ( including dots ). What should the ending of my regex be?
[02:06:24] <ravenzz> Ankabout you can use the details/summary html5 tag and provide a jQuery polyfill for non html5 compliant browsers http://jsfiddle.net/LtDAE/
[02:08:24] <LukeNukem> Ankabout, the second one
[02:09:56] <muzone> Is there a better way to do this collapse-and-expand sidebar? http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/cTVWS/3/
[02:11:17] <\mSg> Sebah, here's a list of valid TLDs http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt However, it's possible for people to make up "tlds" in internal networks...
[02:11:31] <muzone> Sebah: *..[.......]? hehe
[02:12:01] <muzone> nah im just playing.. i always go to #bash and #regex for those kinda questions though
[02:12:35] <LukeNukem> ok im really confused
[02:12:40] <LukeNukem> how does this iframe thingie work?
[02:12:48] <LukeNukem> can someone please help me out from scratch
[02:12:59] <Sebah> \mSg: thanks; muzone: i'm on regex right now, thanks :0
[02:13:18] <\mSg> or you can just brows a list of ones people have already made :p http://regexlib.com/Search.aspx?k=URL&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1
[02:14:01] <ravenzz> Sebah (\.[A-Za-z]{2,4}){1,2} maybe:? otherwise you need an array with all the TDLs
[02:14:19] <muzone> ravenzz: nice :D
[02:14:54] <arkascha> Does anyone have a link for me: looking for a downloadable reference documentation for jquery.
[02:15:04] <arkascha> google only spits out older versions.
[02:15:12] <arkascha> I am loking for something in the .qch format.
[02:32:35] <FC34> Eviltwin> : i read again the link about jQuery.get. But i didn't succeeded to well understand. I can't do what i want. Simple get the html content et check this content
[02:32:52] <FC34> Eviltwin can you give me more informations ?
[02:36:38] <FC34> How to use jQuery .get to get html from an url and read the content of the html ?
[02:37:06] <Hooloovoork> FC34: if you're insane you use .load
[02:37:08] <FC34> I read this http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/ but without success to get fonctional script
[02:38:22] <Hooloovoork> FC34: if you really really have to load an entire page with ajax, use the .load function.
[02:38:29] <mindis|wurk> what's so insane about .load
[02:38:41] <FC34> Hooloovoork thank you for your help
[02:38:57] <Hooloovoork> mindis|wurk: it's not more insane that the idea of requesting a entire page
[02:39:01] <qvarkk> (function($) { }    -- does this replace body.load??
[02:39:03] <FC34> here detail of what i try to do : http://pastebin.fr/22098
[02:39:09] <Mehrdad> does the extend mechanism accept passing the object1 as a named function? what is the syntax?
[02:39:11] <Hooloovoork> qvarkk: ya
[02:39:31] <mindis|wurk> Hooloovoork peh, i find it far simpler to output some parts of a page from php than trying to parse it together in js
[02:39:31] <qvarkk> ok, where do i place window.load?
[02:39:36] <Mehrdad> e.g jQuery.extend( target $.x.y=functon{}
[02:39:38] <Hooloovoork> qvarkk: or rather $(document).load() {}
[02:39:38] <qvarkk> inside this, or do I create another variant?
[02:39:54] <Mehrdad> is it ok?
[02:39:57] <FC34> Hooloovoork : my page is realy simple only the word "resolved"
[02:40:34] <FC34> and i never written a javascript of jquery before this morning
[02:40:57] <Hooloovoork> mindis|wurk: i always send as little data as  possible. puzzle  it togeather is faster to do in frontend than sending a lot from the backend.
[02:41:22] <mindis|wurk> yes, it is but i consider my time more valuable than the servers
[02:42:19] <mindis|wurk> so as long as it's not something that chokes the DB or something similar, the simplest solutions are sufficent
[02:42:26] <Hooloovoork> mindis|wurk: it is slower if you're doing it wrong, ya. there is templating for jquery
[02:42:59] <andalusia> can anybody point me in the direction of clicking on a link and having it cause a flash video to play?
[02:43:26] <FC34> i am in a desert
[02:43:38] <mindis|wurk> of course there is, but i find a lot of time you end up printing similar stuff from the server anyway so adapting to tempating etc. would take more time than it does to just call the same functions server side for ajax as for everything else
[02:45:10] <qvarkk> (function($) { })(jQuery);   -- two questions: 1) doesn't this add a noconflict function aswell? 2) should i put window.load inside or outside this?
[02:45:16] <Ankabout> ravenzz, thanks I'll have a look at that jsfiddle
[02:45:30] <Ankabout> ravenzz, what about <IE8?
[02:46:05] <Ankabout> ravenzz, sorry missed that last part
[02:46:20] <Ankabout> what do you mean by a jQuery polyfill?
[02:46:59] <Mehrdad> when i extend an object . how the parent is constructed?
[02:47:21] <Mehrdad> should i do i manually? a new constructor for the base object vars?
[02:47:27] <Mehrdad> do it*
[02:49:18] <anli_> Does is.(':checked') fail in the newest firefox?
[02:49:21] <anli_> oops
[02:49:25] <anli_> well, foo.is)'
[02:49:27] <anli_> gah
[02:49:31] <anli_> foo.is(':checked');
[02:49:57] <andalusia> is it really easy to have it so that if i click an element in a page, it causes an embedded flash video to play?
[02:53:20] <Mehrdad> anyone?
[02:55:41] <FC34> Hooloovoork : i tested with .load but in the http://api.jquery.com/load/ they give example with #result, but i don't have div in my html
[02:56:18] <ravenzz> Ankabout http://html5please.us/#details
[02:56:29] <Eviltwin> FC34: Have you done asynchronous programming before?
[02:56:43] <FC34> Eviltwin never i a sys admin
[02:56:51] <FC34> not a programmer
[02:56:58] <anli_> Have you done asynchronous system administration then?
[02:57:00] <Eviltwin> Okay, so JavaScript is single-threaded
[02:57:03] <Eviltwin> Do you know what that means?
[02:57:10] <FC34> yes
[02:57:21] <FC34> for the two questions
[02:57:26] <Eviltwin> It means only one thing is running in JavaSCript at once
[02:57:34] <Eviltwin> You're only at one line at a time
[02:57:44] <Eviltwin> And it's not until one function returns that another can begin
[02:57:54] <anli_> unless called withing
[02:57:56] <anli_> within
[02:57:57] <Eviltwin> Now AJAX (what you're doing with $.get) takes time
[02:58:09] <Eviltwin> It wouldn't make sense to have JavaScript block and wait
[02:58:25] <Eviltwin> Because that would mean JavaScript (and in fact the browser as a whole) couldn't do anything else while it was waiting
[02:58:33] <Eviltwin> No event handlers and whatnot
[02:58:36] <Eviltwin> So it uses a callback scheme
[02:58:46] <Eviltwin> $.get(...) returns immediately
[02:58:50] <FC34> ok
[02:58:54] <FC34> i understand
[02:58:54] <Eviltwin> It doesn't wait for the AJAX to complete
[02:59:05] <Eviltwin> And instead you give it a function that will get run once the data is available
[02:59:23] <Eviltwin> Here's a basic example of asynchronous programming that details the order that the code runs in: http://jsfiddle.net/uYeYN/1/
[03:00:04] <Eviltwin> You'll notice that steps M and N run before the data from asqrt is available
[03:00:33] <Eviltwin> Anything that is interested in the data from asqrt must be in or called from within that function(s) { ... } thing
[03:00:36] <fof> maybe he just had to add a <div> :)
[03:00:37] <Eviltwin> Same thing with your code here
[03:01:03] <FC34> yes i noticed that the result is not waited
[03:01:17] <FC34> so how to process the result ?
[03:01:34] <Eviltwin> You take all of the code that you want to process the result
[03:01:46] <Eviltwin> And you put it in place of where you currently have $('body')
[03:01:53] <FC34> aaah
[03:01:55] <FC34> ok
[03:02:03] <FC34> that take meaning
[03:02:24] <Eviltwin> And then you're going to read this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript and this http://jqfundamentals.com/
[03:02:36] <FC34> does it exist a variable that containt the html returned ?
[03:02:37] <Eviltwin> Because you don't seem to really understand how this stuff works
[03:02:40] <Eviltwin> And seem to be guessing instead
[03:03:04] <Eviltwin> FC34: It is showed probably a half dozen times on this page where such a variable comes from: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[03:03:04] <fof> FC34: you could try some exercises first, e.g. http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-php-jquery-ajax/
[03:03:13] <Eviltwin> Actually read, please
[03:03:33] <zykes> hmmm
[03:03:47] <FC34> Eviltwin it is funny but a read several time the jQuery.get page
[03:03:53] <zykes> if i have a var with some html in it, can i execute a html selector on it to make a button ?
[03:04:02] <Eviltwin> FC34: Apparently you did not read it well
[03:04:09] <FC34> yes
[03:04:25] <Eviltwin> At least three of there examples operate on the data that comes back
[03:04:40] <FC34> but now i understand that is it the function inside the get that handle the process
[03:05:11] <Eviltwin> Which, again, is how all of their examples work
[03:05:14] <FC34> Eviltwin many thank for your time
[03:09:18] <elfrancesco__> hi
[03:11:03] <andalusia> hi
[03:13:30] <medicineuk> how can help me with a really easy question
[03:13:33] <medicineuk> ??
[03:13:45] <medicineuk> why can I not get this to work?
[03:13:46] <medicineuk> http://pastebin.com/udx72N5e
[03:14:27] <Eviltwin> You probably need firstItems("h4")
[03:15:56] <medicineuk> Ohh so it passes as a string. Thanks sorry for the stupid question
[03:25:28] <softmanpetro> I see on a site apostrophe is not defined and inside some js files apostrophe.log('aMapSlot -- loadGoogleMapsAPI'); ....
[03:25:36] <softmanpetro> any idee how to fix it please ?
[03:25:48] <Eviltwin> Uh...what?
[03:26:15] <Eviltwin> console.log instead?
[03:26:18] <Eviltwin> I don't follow
[03:26:39] <Hopsy> Eviltwin: whats the matter?
[03:26:44] <softmanpetro> probably I will insert console.logs and see from where it comes
[03:30:49] <rookie84> hi everyone, i've read most of the jquery concepts/tutorials and a book now which way to go? any suggestions please.
[03:31:24] <Mehrdad>  does object extension do the base object vars init automatically? rookie84
[03:32:19] <rookie84> mehrdad: wow i don't know :p
[03:32:35] <rookie84> & thats what i want to know, which way to go? :)
[03:32:53] <Mehrdad> maybe i phrased my question incorrectly?
[03:33:46] <rookie84> not sure, but its beyond my comprehension :)
[03:35:23] <Mehrdad> how does the child object initialize the parent obj when its constructor is called? child obj being the second argument  obj that adds properties to the first argument in jquery.extend method
[03:36:47] <Ankabout> ravenzz, i'll look into doing the next site with html5 tags like that, it's impressive!
[03:37:14] <rookie84> are all html5 tags supported by all modern browsers?
[03:37:19] <fof> rookie84: why not make a site? :)
[03:37:51] <rookie84> hey fof, maybe i should work with people's code and learn from that :)
[03:37:56] <rookie84> lolz i've answered my question
[03:42:25] <Ankabout> anyone know why this doesn't work on the second click?
[03:42:26] <Ankabout> http://jsfiddle.net/ankabout/jQCBR/
[03:43:11] <Ankabout> I fixed the typo with the selector by the way, still doesn't work
[03:50:50] <Ankabout> ravenzz, any reason why the actual page you linked me on HTML doesn't use the details tag for their own site?
[03:51:01] <andalusia> http://www.thegage.co.uk/gocreative/testing.html you'll notice if you click the top left stone on the grid, it shows a video just to the left of the grid. but if you the press the white stone next to it, it brings up another video underneath, when what I want is for the first video to fade away and for the second video to fade in. this is the code I am using.. can anybody help me? http://jsfiddle.net/967rF/
[03:51:40] <amitprakash> Hi.. I have a call back to classselector.live('change', X){ do something } in a js file.. however.. since there are multiple imports of this js file.. I want to be able to detect if I've already defined this behavior.. how can I do this?
[03:53:19] <fof> Ankabout: before trying to fix that, wouldn't it be better as a toggle?
[03:53:43] <Ankabout> why better?
[03:53:48] <Ankabout> less code?
[03:54:01] <andalusia> flood protection? O.o did anybody see my post?
[03:54:43] <iamcurio> is it possible to have jquery to go back to a previous page if already on same site or if you went straight to that page it will go to a certain page?
[03:55:45] <Cork> you mean window.location.go(-1) ?
[03:56:20] <Cork> or window.history.back()
[03:56:23] <Cork> samething
[03:56:56] <andalusia> anybody? :(
[03:57:24] <fof> yeah shorter Ankabout, http://jsfiddle.net/jQCBR/2/
[03:58:27] <iamcurio> Cork: but say i came to the inside page of a site via google the back link would go to google
[03:58:38] <Cork> yes
[03:58:56] <iamcurio> Cork: if it possible to have an if statement to go to a page in the site if the previous page is an external site?
[03:59:02] <Ankabout> fof, oh, and it has a cool effect.... just hope the designer is ok with that. what if I want to have it slide like I did?
[03:59:04] <Cork> nope
[03:59:11] <amitprakash> Cork, hey.. any idea how to check if a script has been included previously?
[03:59:27] <fof> http://jsfiddle.net/jQCBR/3/
[03:59:27] <fof> :P
[03:59:27] <Cork> amitprakash: have the script set a global variable
[03:59:33] <Cork> amitprakash: only way
[03:59:38] <overbythere> Cork: or get_included_files()?
[03:59:48] <overbythere> ohsorry
[03:59:50] <amitprakash> Cork, is that how jquery does it?
[03:59:51] <overbythere> thought this was PHP D:
[03:59:52] <Cork> it would still have to store it somewhere
[04:00:10] <Cork> amitprakash: jquery doesn't care about loaded files
[04:00:15] <amitprakash> hmm ok
[04:00:24] <Cork> amitprakash: javascript isn't a file based language
[04:00:47] <Cork> amitprakash: files is just delivery packages, it all ends up in the same data pool
[04:00:55] <Ankabout> .
[04:01:02] <amitprakash> ok!
[04:01:04] <Ankabout> ah good. thought I was dc
[04:01:25] <fof> sorry if you didnt see Ankabout, use slideToggle for the vertical sliding effect
[04:01:31] <andalusia> cork can you help me with some simple jquery (which is beyond me)?
[04:01:42] <Ankabout> ahhhh wow
[04:01:43] <Ankabout> nice!
[04:01:44] <Ankabout> thanks
[04:01:45] <Cork> andalusia; just ask the question
[04:01:47] <amitprakash> Also, for live events I can do a $(x).live("click", someaction); but what if I want to attach an event based on data- of x.. i.e. $($(x).attr('data-Y')) where x is dynamic in nature?
[04:01:58] <fof> though it's more of a vertical expansion/collapse
[04:02:07] <andalusia> http://www.thegage.co.uk/gocreative/testing.html you'll notice if you click the top left stone on the grid, it shows a video just to the left of the grid. but if you the press the white stone next to it, it brings up another video underneath, when what I want is for the first video to fade away and for the second video to fade in. this is the code I am using.. http://jsfiddle.net/967rF/
[04:02:22] <Ankabout> fof, how do you suggest I change the text in the link? also a toggle between 2 elements, or still changing the text?
[04:02:44] <andalusia> the code works with other elements, ie. if you press the links on the left you can see the stones fading in and out in different patterns
[04:02:54] <andalusia> but for some reason it's not working on the embedded video :\
[04:02:55] <andalusia> but for some reason it's not working on the embedded video :\
[04:03:04] <andalusia> why does flood protection keep activating when i type?!
[04:03:22] <Jon47> cause you're typing the same thing twice?
[04:03:25] <Cork> andalusia: its something in your client
[04:03:42] <jamesgorrie> Hello - I was just wondering if someone had an idea of how I might click on an element of a page, and then extract the most efficient jQuery selector for it
[04:03:43] <andalusia> hmm i just hope everyone can see all my messages
[04:03:48] <FC34> Eviltwin now i process with a function in the .get. But when i use 'return false' or 'return true' the javascript does not return what the function return. Does it exist an other key work perhaps like exit ?
[04:03:58] <andalusia> anyway, i hope somebody can understand my issue! :)
[04:05:29] <ravenzz> Ankabout you are not obligated to use any new html5 tag
[04:06:12] <Ankabout> ravenzz, yeah of course, but it seems like a nice feature, and I'd assume that the site that's promoting it would use it themselves :)
[04:07:27] <ravenzz> mh nah
[04:07:32] <ravenzz> there are short description in there
[04:07:51] <FC34> how to exit from a callback function in a .get ?
[04:08:06] <ravenzz> lol
[04:08:08] <ravenzz> return
[04:08:10] <ravenzz> :?
[04:08:18] <FC34> it is what i thougth
[04:08:30] <FC34> but the return il not used by javascript
[04:08:42] <FC34> s/il/is/
[04:09:01] <sayyestolife> Hello.
[04:09:49] <FC34> ravenzz have a look to this http://pastebin.fr/22100
[04:09:55] <sayyestolife> Isn't it possible to do AND in selector where you select on attributes, such as : $('[name^="start"][name$="end"]');
[04:10:00] <sayyestolife> ??
[04:10:12] <FC34> the function CheckAddIp return always the same value
[04:10:30] <FC34> but the alert show me that the if /else if running well
[04:10:56] <amitprakash> Hi, for live events I can do a $(x).live("click", someaction); but what if I want to attach an event based on data- of x.. i.e. $($(x).attr('data-Y')).click( ...do something...); where x is dynamic in nature?
[04:11:31] <Cork> amitprakash: normally you don't want to
[04:11:49] <ravenzz> FC34 why do you need to return if you are using if/else statements?
[04:12:03] <Cork> amitprakash: cause that selector is slow, and it would have to match each element you ever click on in the page
[04:12:05] <fof> Ankabout: for changing the text, you could put a ternary statement in the toggle callback
[04:12:11] <Cork> amitprakash: so it will make your page slow
[04:12:20] <amitprakash> Cork, hmm
[04:12:32] <amitprakash> so think of a better way.. gotcha
[04:12:52] <Cork> amitprakash: you basically only want to use class, element names posibly id's (thoug they'r often pointless) in live selectors
[04:13:13] <FC34> ravenzz if the function CheckAddIp return true of false the process is not the same
[04:13:16] <fof> e.g. text = (text == "read more") ? "read less" : "read more";
[04:13:34] <aqeel> hi room
[04:13:35] <amitprakash> Cork, but why would it be slow once the event handler is registered?
[04:13:47] <Cork> amitprakash: but you can do an attribute selector like live('div[data-Y]'
[04:13:54] <amitprakash> i.e. :O
[04:14:03] <amitprakash> that I didn't know
[04:14:06] <FC34> FC34 the function ChecckAddIp is called from an other peace of code
[04:14:07] <Cork> amitprakash: cause the handler is registered on document
[04:14:17] <FC34> ravenzz the function ChecckAddIp is called from an other peace of code
[04:14:26] <ravenzz> yes I see that now
[04:14:26] <aqeel> how to select every 3rd element starting from 2nd
[04:14:27] <Cork> amitprakash: and it runs the match on each time ex. a click bubbles up to document
[04:14:28] <ravenzz> 1 sec
[04:14:34] <amitprakash> that sucks
[04:14:36] <Cork> amitprakash: that means every click on the page
[04:14:44] <Cork> amitprakash: so you want them to be fast
[04:14:46] <amitprakash> Cork, I thought it happened on the dom element
[04:14:54] <Cork> amitprakash: not posible
[04:14:58] <amitprakash> hmm
[04:14:59] <Cork> then it would be bind
[04:15:15] <Cork> the reason live works is cause it doesn't bind on the acutal element
[04:15:30] <aqeel> what equation would it be
[04:15:35] <Cork> amitprakash: a reason to limit the cost of live is to use delegate instead
[04:15:37] <amitprakash> Cork, so if I get rid of live.. it will be fast enough?
[04:15:44] <Cork> then you can limit the number of element affected
[04:16:00] <Cork> amitprakash: if you match soly on the attribute; no
[04:16:15] <Cork> amitprakash: attribute selectors is the next slowest selector you can make
[04:16:25] <Cork> amitprakash: the only slower one is :contains
[04:16:59] <Cork> amitprakash: but if you put the attribute selector on an element selector that match few elements, the cost is low
[04:17:15] <Cork> like 'video[data-my-data]'
[04:17:19] <Cork> or something like that
[04:17:29] <henrikbjorn> is the a selector like :contains but that matches a specific value
[04:17:33] <Cork> in other words, don't use it for spans, divs, p and the like
[04:18:20] <Cork> henrikbjorn: :contains has to grab the entire html of the earlier match and serialize it to string and then regex match it
[04:18:27] <henrikbjorn> yes
[04:18:37] <henrikbjorn> i need something like a :text(asd)
[04:18:41] <Cork> *uh... of the element
[04:18:42] <henrikbjorn> where asd is the exact match
[04:18:48] <Cork> its the same thing
[04:18:53] <Cork> it would just have to do even more work
[04:19:33] <Cork> grab element, serialize content, filter out html from content, match result
[04:19:48] <aqeel> any please....
[04:20:14] <Cork> ?.nextAll @ aqeel
[04:20:15] <bot-t> aqeel, .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[04:20:24] <amitprakash> Cork, heres my problem in its original form.. there is a select box which contains the attr data-parent: 'parent_select_id' .. the options in this select should depend on the parents selected option [ think city  select box having state select for parent]
[04:22:02] <Cork> isn't it just better to change the options when you change the data-parent?
[04:22:15] <Cork> posibly provide a function that does it for you
[04:22:30] <aqeel> sorry guys....not that...i want to select nth child.....how to select every 3rd element starting from 2nd [need  math equation]
[04:22:39] <amitprakash> Cork, the options need to change when $(data-parent)'s options change..
[04:22:54] <amitprakash> data-parent simply tells you who this select box takes for a parent
[04:22:59] <fof> Ankabout: http://jsfiddle.net/jQCBR/4/
[04:23:42] <aqeel> 3n works great for every third element but i want it to start from 2nd element
[04:24:16] <aqeel> do 3n from 2nd element
[04:24:24] <fof> better outside of the callback: http://jsfiddle.net/jQCBR/5/
[04:25:54] <amitprakash> Cork, is there a better way than $($(city).attr(data-Y)).change  then
[04:25:55] <fof> could of course show/hide a separate anchor with the toggle :)
[04:30:58] <andalusia> it's ok. i figured it out. :)
[04:35:30] <soee> is it possible to access every 4th element in some container ? basicly to add some css to evry 4th paragraph inside div
[04:36:56] <Ankabout> fof, thanks! that's such a more efficient method than mine
[04:37:02] * Ankabout takes notes for next time
[04:41:37] <xec> ?:nth-child @ soee
[04:41:37] <bot-t> soee, :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[04:42:00] <xec> :nth-child(4n) would be every 4th
[04:44:28] <xec> if aqeel comes back, every 3rd starting with 2nd would be :nth-child(3n-1)
[04:44:30] <xec> i think
[04:45:14] <soee> xec, yes just found it
[04:47:31] <LukeNukem> Hi, can someone help me use ajax to upload files
[04:48:06] <Cork> LukeNukem: not all browsers will allow you to do that

[04:50:53] <Cork> its much more then flash
[04:50:57] <john-dev> y..
[04:50:58] <LukeNukem> Cork, can the files be accessed using the $_FILES variable from php, cos i do a lot of file validation using that

[04:56:52] <imc> hello, I'm puzzled about (jquery ui's) "position" option
[04:57:13] <imc> is it possible to say "horizontally centered, 100px from top" somehow?
[04:57:55] <imc> ehm for jquery ui's dialogs
[04:58:29] <imc> now i've put "center", and the top-left corner is centered, not the dialog
[05:00:24] <rangzen> Hello all, here is the demo of my problem (tabs is not set to the dynamic contents) : http://l-homme.com/jtartQage/ and the source : https://bitbucket.org/rangzen/jtartqage/src
[05:01:35] <rangzen> and an old message (2008) on the list but with no answer : http://www.mail-archive.com/jquery-en@googlegroups.com/msg21966.html

[05:07:11] <aqeel> 3n+2................starts at 2 and every 3rd element
[05:08:48] <aqeel> well guys.....an+b......know this.......an to increment every element by........b to start from which number....
[05:09:41] <aqeel> $("selector:nth-child(an+b)")
[05:10:34] <jaffipaffi> Is there a way to reset a div's innerhtml to the state it was when the DOM was loaded (i.e. from the sourcecode)?
[05:12:51] <aqeel> yes u can use load
[05:13:19] <aqeel> or make a .text(original text)
[05:13:40] <aqeel> and replace your changed div contents when mouseout or something like that
[05:14:41] <aqeel> or use html()...to support fully html tags included as u actually will be making html page
[05:17:18] <jaffipaffi> aqeel: I figured out the best way was to clone the div to a variable, and then replaceWith when needed to go to the original state
[05:17:49] <aqeel> well that can serve too
[05:17:59] <aqeel> chosse what is best
[05:23:11] <aqeel>  $("#id>li:nth-child(3n+2)").css("","");..................how to have this center
[05:23:23] <aqeel> not text-align but the li itself
[05:24:09] <aqeel> 3n+1 is float left, 3n+3 is float  right
[05:25:11] <LukeNukem> HI, CAN SOMEONE FFS HELP ME DO UPLOAD FILES LIKE AJAX?

[05:26:20] <Sebah> LukeNukem have a look at -> http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/ ( and please, for the sake of my eyes, turn your caps lock off :) )
[05:26:54] <LukeNukem> i want to write my own. :|
[05:27:12] <LukeNukem> i only want to be able to add one file
[05:27:47] <Sebah> LukeNukem I think you have that option with that plugin
[05:27:56] <Sebah> LukeNukem have a look at the documentation]
[05:28:18] <aqeel> so how do i center my 3n+2 li.....
[05:28:51] <Sebah> aqeel do you have a certain width for that 'li' ?
[05:29:07] <aqeel> well it is in %
[05:29:38] <aqeel> width:80%;
[05:30:04] <Sebah> hmmm... your css should look like li {position:relative; left:50%;margin-left:-40%;} ( I think )
[05:31:04] <LukeNukem> Sebah, im trying this http://www.openjs.com/articles/ajax/ajax_file_upload/
[05:31:10] <LukeNukem> and nothing comes into the iframe
[05:31:18] <aqeel> sorry......i have this......entire li is float left, then....$("#smcul>li:nth-child(3n+3)").css("float","right");......balance 3n+2.....also shifted left....due to default css
[05:32:09] <aqeel> it is 3 columns of li
[05:32:12] <Sebah> LukeNukem sorry, I can't assist you with your issue ( I'm pretty new to all this stuff, but I used the plugin I mentioned, that's why I recommended it )
[05:32:15] <aqeel> per row
[05:32:34] <Sebah> aqeel please use http://jsfiddle.net/ for your code, so I can have a look at it as well :)
[05:32:47] <aqeel> ok...
[05:32:55] <LukeNukem> Sebah, bah, the plugin has over 3 js files -_-
[05:33:24] <Sebah> LukeNukem sorry mate, that's all I can do. Maybe someone else can assist you
[05:33:37] <LukeNukem> AH FUCK THE WORLD -__
[05:33:57] <Sebah> LukeNukem double that :)
[05:34:18] <LukeNukem> john-dev, cbf studying it and configure it..
[05:34:47] <john-dev> cbf?
[05:34:52] <LukeNukem> cant be fucked
[05:35:00] <aqeel> sebah........jailbreak.webege.com\advance.html......click mm and sm in the site
[05:35:28] <aqeel> u can see sm has middle shifted to left
[05:35:31] <john-dev> never heared that shortcut
[05:35:45] <Sebah> :))
[05:36:10] <LukeNukem> john-dev, i download pluploader, which one to use? js? silverlight? html5..whats all this??
[05:36:37] <john-dev> html,flash,html4 is the order i prefer
[05:36:44] <john-dev> include all of them
[05:36:49] <john-dev> all you want*
[05:36:56] <Sebah> aqeel: so you want your li's to be nicely aligned? ( i did not follow your issue from beginning )
[05:36:57] <john-dev> html5,flash,html4
[05:37:17] <aqeel> yes....the middle ones ...
[05:37:19] <aqeel> thanks
[05:37:36] <john-dev> LukeNukem, this are the different upload methos, html5 should be main, fallback is flash, next fallback is html4
[05:38:01] <johanhar> .next() is not working for me, I got the element doing next on, it exists, it got a sibling, but no, nothing returned :(
[05:38:09] <LukeNukem> daah
[05:38:16] <LukeNukem> I DONT WANT TO INCLUDE ALL THESE FILES
[05:38:23] <amitev> hi all
[05:38:29] <john-dev> 3 :-/ whatever..
[05:38:34] <blackspotwiggins> lol
[05:38:34] <LukeNukem> what a pain in the ass..
[05:38:48] <blackspotwiggins> HELP ME, BUT NOT LIKE THAT WAY
[05:38:49] <LukeNukem> ajax, Y U NO SUPPORT FILES
[05:38:52] <amitev> does jquery have an oop like yui. where you can define classes with widgets and have other classes that extend each other, etc..
[05:39:00] <blackspotwiggins> LukeNukem, i told you many hours ago, use xhr2
[05:39:03] <blackspotwiggins> it works, srsly
[05:39:04] <john-dev> LukeNukem, stop it..
[05:39:34] <LukeNukem> blackspotwiggins, i tried it, i did not succeed. neither can i understand anything without the tutorials comment pieces of code -_-
[05:39:44] <aqeel> amitev jquery ui
[05:39:49] <blackspotwiggins> so why not use a plugin? you certainly cant write your own
[05:39:59] <LukeNukem> Also i use $_FILES variable in php to do file validation, it cant work without this
[05:40:08] <LukeNukem> the iframes seems to use a different variable
[05:40:19] <blackspotwiggins> xhr2 is not iframes
[05:40:23] <LukeNukem> but i tried the iframe way and i cant get it to work either T_T
[05:40:25] <aqeel> sebah can help?
[05:40:33] <LukeNukem> blackspotwiggins, link me a good tutorial?
[05:40:59] <amitev> aqeel: what's jquery ui?
[05:41:09] <LukeNukem> jquery user interface
[05:41:09] <LukeNukem> o.o
[05:41:26] <blackspotwiggins> LukeNukem, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest#Using_FormData_objects
[05:41:30] <aqeel> http://jqueryui.com/
[05:41:42] <blackspotwiggins> and dont moan about php here, that's not jquery related
[05:42:08] <Sebah> aqeel: i'm looking at it ( it's a bit tricky because you're using % )
[05:42:24] <aqeel> yup...that is the case
[05:42:32] <john-dev> amitev, its an addition to jquery providing nice ui tweaks and stuff like that
[05:44:39] <Sebah> aqeel: and you also have borders and stuff on the li's...
[05:44:47] <aqeel> yes...
[05:45:16] <zungerl> !info
[05:45:45] <aqeel> sebah can i make it display as table cell?
[05:46:09] <aqeel> well with cell spacing...and make ul into table
[05:46:44] <aqeel> ul.....display:table.............li...display:table cell
[05:46:59] <DukeDrake> how can I select an element with an attribute 'myttribute=something' ?
[05:47:04] <aqeel> then on ul tablespellspacing.....
[05:47:09] <Mehrdad> is this correct? jQuery.extend($.MapQuery.Layer,$.MapQuery.Vector=function (map, id, options,features)
[05:47:15] <Mehrdad> the syntax
[05:47:28] <blackspotwiggins> not rly
[05:47:38] <Mehrdad> using a named function inside an extend method
[05:48:15] <Sebah> aqeel: sorry mate, can't help you either. it's really trick what you're trying to achieve there and unfortunatelly my time doesn't allow it at the moment :(
[05:48:25] <Mehrdad> blackspotwiggins, how can i define a named function and use extend on it in one command?
[05:48:36] <aqeel> thanks it is ok...
[05:48:51] <blackspotwiggins> Mehrdad, extend doesnt work like $.extend({}, function())
[05:49:08] <blackspotwiggins> the second (and third.. ) argument should be an object
[05:49:13] <blackspotwiggins> read the docs for a change
[05:49:32] <Mehrdad> i've seen defining a function inside extend as the second argument
[05:49:40] <Mehrdad> but not sure about using named functions
[05:50:18] <blackspotwiggins> Mehrdad, that's totally not relevant
[05:50:23] <Mehrdad> read the docs, but didn;'t see it mentioned
[05:50:28] <amitev> aqeel: and jquery ui has a oop in it?
[05:50:29] <blackspotwiggins> so im gonna ignore you from now on
[05:50:46] <aqeel> it is baed on oop
[05:50:49] <Mehrdad> blackspotwiggins O_o
[05:52:09] <amitev> aqeel: i'm looking for something like this - http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yahoo/#extend
[05:53:48] <aqeel> amitev....http://jqueryui.com/demos/
[05:55:24] <jamesgorrie> Hey - I know this exists, but I was wondering if there was anything out there that can uspply you with the simplest selector for an element: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5706837/get-unique-selector-of-element-in-jquery
[05:55:31] <aqeel> http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/...................everything sutomized
[05:56:19] <donCams> what do you call the jquery ui that is like <input type="number"> ?
[05:56:24] <jamesgorrie> I know Optimizely do a really good job of it
[05:56:31] <Seubeu> Hi All. I've a little issue here with $.load() regarding to documentation the callback function is suppose to be executed AFTER the load instruction... but according to Firebug the callback is executed before... any advice about it ???
[05:56:42] <LukeNukem> blackspotwiggins, << him Mehrdad ?
[05:56:57] <aqeel> indow.load()
[05:57:13] <aqeel> sorry...window.load()...document..load()
[05:57:19] <LukeNukem> you're a dick blackspotwiggins
[05:57:26] <aqeel> old kwyboard....
[05:57:50] <blackspotwiggins> LukeNukem, sure, w/e. if i gave you the exact thing you asked for and you just ignored it
[05:58:02] <blackspotwiggins> then you'd be the dick
[05:58:12] <LukeNukem> blackspotwiggins, thanks for the link, the dick comment that was not from me.
[05:58:32] <Jon47> when jquery sees a selector like $('#foo .bar'), does it optimize that to $('#foo').find('bar') internally?
[05:58:56] <chee> potent
[05:59:07] <aqeel> jon no
[05:59:38] <aqeel> have to see jquery.js for that
[06:01:55] <Jon47> aqeel the tests confirm your answer: http://jsperf.com/internal-optimization-for-left-to-right-selectors
[06:02:36] <Jon47> 50% slower and that's in a really concise DOM, i'm sure the results are even more remarkable in a more normal sized document
[06:05:10] <aqeel> 	  $('#foo .bar');.................this looks for both in the entire documents.....
[06:05:37] <aqeel> $('#foo').find('.bar');.............id is specific and thus find within that
[06:09:12] <Mehrdad> is extend method the only way we 'inherit' objects?
[06:13:13] <juria_roberts> why is this not working?
[06:13:14] <juria_roberts> http://pastie.org/3401585
[06:16:23] <donCams> juria_roberts, what's it supposed to do and what is it doing?
[06:16:49] <juria_roberts> donCams:its supposed to show a multiSelect drop down

[06:26:27] <Carlitta87> hey guys
[06:26:30] <xec> juria_roberts: using an old jquery version is almost always a bad idea. using a plugin that relies on an old version is usually also a bad idea

[06:35:02] <Carlitta87> xec: superfish is the first one...
[06:35:11] <xec> that explains the problem
[06:36:48] <Carlitta87> xec: wat shud be the first one then?

[06:48:16] <muzone> Any suggestions, comments or whatever?
[06:48:57] <xec> Carlitta87: is the superfish.js included before you try to call .superfish() ?
[06:49:36] <xec> sphinxxx: it means the name of the resource starts with an underscore ?
[06:49:38] <xec> :D

[06:50:47] <Kunda> what does this warning mean and how do i resolve it? "Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type binary/octet-stream: "http://cloud.github.com/downloads/malsup/cycle/jquery.cycle.all.latest.js"."
[06:51:51] <blackspotwiggins> Kunda, it means the server sets the mime binary/octet-stream for some reason
[06:51:55] <sphinxxx> xec:  lol, i didn't think of that
[06:52:00] <sphinxxx> i thought it had some special meaning
[06:52:10] <blackspotwiggins> you can't change it unless you hack into github
[06:52:51] <lacrymology> when I make an AJAX post, how can I reload the page if I get a redirect?
[06:53:03] <Kunda> blackspotwiggins, should I be vigilant about this?
[06:53:06] <blackspotwiggins> lacrymology, dont use ajax?
[06:53:12] <blackspotwiggins> Kunda, it's not a biggie
[06:53:23] <Kunda> k
[06:53:24] <blackspotwiggins> Kunda, you could host it yourself, if it really bothers you
[06:53:25] <lacrymology> blackspotwiggins: yes, sounds like a good answer XD
[06:53:32] <MichaelBehan> Has anyone implemented URI templating draft-gregorio-uritemplate-04?
[06:53:40] <Kunda> blackspotwiggins, Thanks for the feedback
[06:53:59] <Jeroenem> Hi im trying to detect a mobile device OR pc in order to show different content on a single page... but how to do this? I tried this, but it didnt work...
[06:54:00] <Jeroenem> http://pastie.org/3401775
[06:54:07] <blackspotwiggins> lacrymology, if you need full page reloads then using ajax is kinda dumb
[06:54:40] <z0ned> can anyone please tell me why this doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/2wqPL/
[06:55:52] <xec> Jeroenem: sounds like a job for media queries
[06:56:31] <warrenparsons> z0ned: Try this - http://jsfiddle.net/2wqPL/1/
[06:56:42] <Zogot> http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/9bzeu/1/
[06:56:44] <Zogot> bah
[06:56:46] <Zogot> beat me just
[06:56:52] <warrenparsons> z0ned: You were trying to run a jQuery method on a non-jQuery object. Wrapping "this" was key.
[06:57:18] <z0ned> ahh.
[06:57:20] <Jeroenem> xec: thats css 3 right? i have to get the things to work on IE6 and IE7 :/
[06:57:30] <warrenparsons> z0ned: I also changed .html() to .text() since you only wanted to change the text node,.
[06:57:54] <Jeroenem> xec: then i have to specify min or max width in css - those old 'browsers' don't like 'm
[06:58:09] <warrenparsons> z0ned: But it works either way with your test case.
[06:58:17] <fof> sorry, http://jsfiddle.net/2wqPL/2/
[06:58:19] <z0ned> warrenparsons, by using $(this) it has cached the selector result right? or should i start out by saying var toggle = $("#toggle"); and referencing that
[06:58:30] <fof> :P
[06:58:54] <xec> Jeroenem: assume ie6 and ie7 and make changes for mobile with media queries
[06:59:12] <Carlitta87> xec: testing in IETESTER, IE9 Version Keeps crashing
[06:59:15] <xec> Jeroenem: old browsers will simply ignore it
[06:59:35] <xec> Carlitta87: cool. did you read my last question?
[07:00:24] <warrenparsons> z0ned: Yeah, I stored the reference to $(this) because it's slightly more performant (and easier to read) than grabbing the reference each time. It's more critical when you're dealing with a selector (like $('#myelement') ) Since you're only using the $('#toggle') object one time here, there's no reason to cache it in a var. If you're going to make further references to it, however, caching it is wise.
[07:00:27] <xec> Jeroenem: of course, i am assuming you only need to do stuff you can do with css, such as hiding
[07:00:59] <Carlitta87> xec...yes it is?
[07:01:05] <Carlitta87> thats how i saw it in the example
[07:01:28] <warrenparsons> z0ned: Also, a common practice is to prefix the name of any variable containing a jQuery object with $ so that you can tell at a glance that the variable contains a jQuery object.
[07:01:36] <z0ned> warrenparsons, thanks. and what's the e.preventDefault for?
[07:01:59] <warrenparsons> z0ned: It does what it says on the tin - in the case of A tags, it prevents the link from being followed.
[07:01:59] <xec> Carlitta87: you still haven't explained what is working and what is not
[07:02:13] <Jeroenem> xec: yes, but them old browser wont show my PC version when using min-width or max-width in my media query right
[07:02:53] <Carlitta87> well 7 8 and 10 now loods after i removed sum stuff....but 9 keeps crashing...i wish an error msg wud pop up but nothing comes up...it just crashes
[07:02:57] <warrenparsons> z0ned: Notice that I wrote â¦ .click(function(e)â¦ The e in e.preventDefault() references that. The e is just shorthand for "event"
[07:03:12] <xec> Jeroenem: exactly. you create styles for nonsupporting browsers first, and then put changes in media queries
[07:03:22] <Carlitta87> xec^; well 7 8 and 10 now loods after i removed sum stuff....but 9 keeps crashing...i wish an error msg wud pop up but nothing comes up...it just crashes....forgot to add ur name
[07:04:17] <karstenk1977_> How can i make a json Object from my form element?

[07:05:12] <soahccc> I've got a problem with jcarousel. The horizontal one works as expected but in the looped vertical one I always get two empty entries (placeholders). Like this (closed uncommented) https://github.com/jsor/jcarousel/issues/272
[07:05:13] <socialhapy> â Issue #272 on jcarousel, reported by lukashes (2m, 3w ago): Circular problem
[07:05:19] <soahccc> My markup: http://www.project-production.de/chaos/images/_html_body_div_div%5B3%5D_%28http__www.w3.org_1999_xhtml%29-20120217-160400.png
[07:05:23] <Carlitta87> xec: the pages come up with no errors: only looks weird but no errors are there.
[07:05:36] <soahccc> Does somebody have an idea?
[07:07:01] <karstenk1977_> How can i make a json Object from my form element?
[07:07:51] <ajpiano> ?g ben alman serializeObject github @ karstenk1977_
[07:07:52] <bot-t> karstenk1977_, jQuery Plugin: .serializeObject() | danheberden - http://danheberden.com/jquery-plugin-serializeobject-2011-04-01/
[07:08:34] <ajpiano> karstenk1977_: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#serializeobject
[07:08:41] <karstenk1977_> no chance without Plugin?
[07:09:03] <nFFF> Yes
[07:09:16] <nFFF> ?serializeArray
[07:09:16] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[07:09:36] <nFFF> and just loop through and build the object how you want
[07:09:59] <ajpiano> karstenk1977_: that "plugin" is literally a *tiny* wrapper around serializeArray
[07:10:20] <karstenk1977_> thanks
[07:10:29] <stephanj> hi, i got an uri(<a> with an delete uri), what would be the easiest way to add a sort of confirmation before letting the user execute the delete?
[07:10:44] <ajpiano> bot-t: withoutplugin is Just because you don't want to *use* a plugin doesn't mean you can't *look at its source code to figure out how to solve your problem.*
[07:10:44] <bot-t> ajpiano, Stored "withoutplugin".
[07:10:48] <ajpiano> karstenk1977_: ^^
[07:11:16] <nFFF> stephanj alert() ?

[07:11:41] <ajpiano> stephanj: $("#deletelink").click(function(e) { if (!confirm("Are u sure bro?")) { e.preventDefault(); };    });
[07:11:54] <nFFF> :P
[07:24:11] <hashpuppy> is there a better way to write this?  also, this wouldn't escape html characters in msg, right?  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/552594/
[07:27:35] <xec> hashpuppy: you should pass a function to setTimout, rather than a string to execute
[07:28:02] <hashpuppy> ahh... ok.  thanks for the tip
[07:29:19] <xec> hashpuppy: $("#id").find(".class") is better (readability and performance) than $(".class", "#id")
[07:30:06] <hashpuppy> haha.  i thought someone told me the opposite last time i asked.  i agree it's better readability
[07:30:29] <xec> that's odd =/
[07:30:49] <fof> Jon47 pasted something earlier showing the perf difference
[07:31:14] <Jon47> fof my example didn't use the context as a second parameter
[07:31:29] <fof> ah true
[07:31:29] <xec> hashpuppy: and, of course, if msg contains something nasty (like a script tag) this function won't do anything to stop it
[07:32:08] <xec> i don't know if there's a nice straightforward way to escape to html entities
[07:32:19] <hashpuppy> yeah, i was wondering how else to generate that html?  i could just generate it like is w/o concatenating msg and then find p.msg and .text(msg);
[07:32:29] <hashpuppy> using .text works
[07:37:17] <aidan101> hey I have the following code to make my fancybox work
[07:37:18] <aidan101> http://pastie.org/3401981
[07:37:45] <aidan101> I need to add to this a rel="fancybox" to each image anyone know what I need to add to it
[07:40:43] <xec> hashpuppy: there are a few things you can do , concatenate or use some sort of template (see .supplant() at http://javascript.crockford.com/remedial.html) or you can create DOM objects in js manually, or .clone() some from your document
[07:41:31] <hashpuppy> thanks
[07:42:06] <xec> hashpuppy: i don't think any of these are superior ways of creating content, but all of them works - so it comes down to preference and different use cases really
[07:42:16] <hashpuppy> gotcha
[07:42:22] <hashpuppy> good to know what else is out there, though
[07:43:58] <xec> there is a templating module being written for jquery UI, might be a good alternative in the future, the current "official" templating plugin from ms is abandoned, iirc
[07:46:17] <DrMabuse|Zz> hello

[07:48:43] <DrMabuse|Zz> i do this worked 2 -3 event then stopped
[07:49:08] <DrMabuse|Zz> i want to scrol a image by mouse move
[07:49:23] <xec> afk 5 mins, could you make it a working demo?
[07:49:36] <DrMabuse|Zz> yes
[07:49:40] <DrMabuse|Zz> wait 5 min
[07:49:42] <DrMabuse|Zz> :)
[07:54:03] <PrgmrBill> got a simple checkbox question here http://jsfiddle.net/5dth4/
[07:54:27] <PrgmrBill> the idea is to filter the select options according to a set of checkboxes
[07:55:43] <mathi> hi
[07:55:45] <Pupeno_W> Does anybody know if there's a jquery plugin or script that would attach to the click of all forms, and before submitting it would pick all the contenteditable elements and create invisible textareas for them.
[07:55:59] <mathi> var elements = $(data).find('.cacheData');    elements.shift() <- I got an error here: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'shift'
[07:56:12] <PrgmrBill> Pupeno_W: $('form').each(function() { // get elements }
[07:56:17] <PrgmrBill> );
[07:56:59] <mathi> any ideas?
[07:57:21] <xec> mathi: what is elements?
[07:57:36] <mathi> xec, var elements = $(data).find('.cacheData');
[07:57:41] <Pupeno_W> PrgmrBill: I know I could write itâ¦ but I'm sure I'm not the first one to have this problem and I'm sure there might be some corner cases I have no idea about.
[07:57:51] <ag4ve> i'm having some trouble with the dyve autocomplete library. basically, when i 'filterResults: false' (default being true) it doesn't return any results
[07:58:02] <xec> mathi: oh sorry, must be getting tired - what is shift :D
[07:58:12] <nFFF> Yea is shift a plugin?
[07:58:18] <PrgmrBill> no, it's an array method
[07:58:18] <nFFF> Its not a native jquery method
[07:58:22] <PrgmrBill> it exists in many languages
[07:58:25] <mathi> xec, it's the PHP equivalent of array_shift? popping first element out of array
[07:58:27] <mathi> no?
[07:58:33] <xec> PrgmrBill: yes but elements is not an array
[07:58:39] <mathi> why?
[07:58:42] <PrgmrBill> which is why it doesn't work :P
[07:59:04] <xec> mathi: it is a jquery collection
[07:59:20] <PrgmrBill> jquery has something called arrayshift, maybe that would work
[07:59:22] <mathi> a... and how can I convert it in array?
[07:59:27] <mathi> h
[08:00:40] <xec> mathi: you might be able to do something similar with .slice
[08:01:52] <drakythe> So... pretty much a jQuery newb here. I'm trying to customize a formed with collapsed fields via checkboxes and select lists. I'm working on it in jsFiddle but I can't get anything to toggle off a select list value, does jsFiddle handle that functionality well?
[08:01:57] <xec> mathi: or .eq(0).remove()
[08:02:27] <xec> mathi: or .first()
[08:02:39] <mathi> xec, first() will not remove the item
[08:02:51] <xec> no, i meant instead of .eq(0)
[08:02:56] <xec> you'd still need .remove()
[08:04:35] <mathi> xec, strange I have an infinite loop now :)
[08:04:41] <xec> awesome :D
[08:05:24] <mathi> var elements = $(data).find('.cacheData'); var processing = function() { var element = elements.first().remove(); [...] if (elements.length > 0) setTimeout(processing, 1000); }; processing();
[08:05:41] <fof> drakythe: can you link it?
[08:06:25] <drakythe> fof: http://jsfiddle.net/drakythe/TKGgD/1/ The commented jquery stuff at the top is my example/learning code so you can ignore that
[08:06:56] <drakythe> fof: its also a really big form, so the html is a little long...
[08:07:51] <xec> mathi: could you make it a working demo with some dummy data?
[08:09:40] <xec> drakythe: what is it you expect to happen?
[08:10:08] <drakythe> xec: Based on what they choose in the select list a fieldset should get toggled on
[08:10:26] <Altreus> what events do I need to unbind to remove the effects of .hover()?
[08:11:10] <fof> theyre toggling on dom ready correctly
[08:11:20] <Altreus> oh derp
[08:11:25] <Altreus> Altreus: y u no read docs
[08:11:30] <fof> now you need to attach events to elements which will toggle what you want
[08:11:42] <pom> Can anyone hint me on what method to look for if I need to know where on the object a user clicked?
[08:12:09] <fof> http://api.jquery.com/click/
[08:12:18] <DrMabuse|Zz> @xec http://jsfiddle.net/MWnz8/4/
[08:12:39] <fof> sorry, this combines the 2: http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[08:14:08] <DrMabuse|Zz> @xec sorry this one i forgot the class
[08:14:26] <DrMabuse|Zz> http://jsfiddle.net/MWnz8/5/
[08:14:49] <drakythe> fof: Okay so wait, do I need .click() or am I fine using just .toggle()?
[08:14:58] * drakythe hates being such a newb O.o
[08:15:15] <fof> you do the toggle in the click handler, as in the toggle example
[08:15:32] <mathi> xec, http://jsfiddle.net/V84mH/    infinite loop
[08:15:46] <mathi> xec (I'm in cyber café, I might disconnect but will reconnect :))
[08:16:24] <drakythe> fof: ohhhh, okay. And .click() will handle a select list?
[08:16:39] <xec> drakythe: does this make sense to you? http://jsfiddle.net/ZPXPq/2/
[08:17:17] <fof> like this, http://jsfiddle.net/TKGgD/2/
[08:18:36] <drakythe> xec: pretty sure it will if I look at it long enough ;) thanks
[08:19:03] <drakythe> fof: okay, I was thinking of the click wrong, thanks
[08:19:44] <fof> sorry yeah, xec's is a good example for the comboboxes
[08:19:46] <DrMabuse|Zz> @xec http://jsfiddle.net/MWnz8/10/
[08:19:47] <fof> select list
[08:19:53] <DrMabuse|Zz> no see the result
[08:19:58] <DrMabuse|Zz> now
[08:20:00] <DrMabuse|Zz> ^^
[08:20:16] <xec> hehe
[08:21:26] <mathi> xec, any idea why it loops?
[08:21:27] <xec> DrMabuse|Zz: on the previous one it went to top:580px and now -580px - which happens to be the size of my viewport
[08:21:34] <mathi> looks like the element doesn't get removed
[08:21:38] <mathi> maybe soem scope issue?
[08:22:03] <fof> drakythe: click also picks up keypresses in case you wondered
[08:22:09] <DrMabuse|Zz> yes its strange in jsfiddle window
[08:22:12] <afeijo> hi guys
[08:22:14] <drakythe> fof: handy
[08:22:16] <fof> ie. tab + space
[08:22:23] <DrMabuse|Zz> normally i want scroll -top
[08:22:35] <afeijo> I have an $().unbind() that get overriden by another ajax call. I need to make this unbind() live(), how can I do that?
[08:22:44] <DrMabuse|Zz> and then back
[08:23:13] <DrMabuse|Zz> its a big picture
[08:23:33] <DrMabuse|Zz> so i want the user can scrol by scrolling up with the mouse
[08:23:41] <kilua17> hello
[08:23:51] <DrMabuse|Zz> and dow
[08:23:53] <DrMabuse|Zz> n
[08:25:14] <DrMabuse|Zz> ah not my js read window and the jsfiddle html is in iframe ^^^
[08:25:36] <DrMabuse|Zz> oh mÃ¤n that sukcs
[08:26:00] <DrMabuse|Zz> xec i will do on server the project then you can see the example
[08:26:03] <DrMabuse|Zz> ok
[08:26:11] <DrMabuse|Zz> ?
[08:26:31] <xec> ok, but it's a bit long code to just look through
[08:26:40] <xec> do you know where it fails?
[08:26:50] <DrMabuse|Zz> no
[08:27:02] <DrMabuse|Zz> the first and second will do np
[08:27:06] <kilua17> http://new.aoiparty.com/development/newajaxtabs.html <- i used jquery tabs and jpaginate,, but the jpaginate doesn't work.. it seems there's a conflict.. any idea to make it work both??
[08:27:24] <DrMabuse|Zz> but after i wait one inute for the effect
[08:27:30] <DrMabuse|Zz> i dont no why
[08:27:40] <DrMabuse|Zz> i think mousemoverender a lot
[08:27:54] <DrMabuse|Zz> and the browser fukced up
[08:29:20] <xec> mathi: i don't think .remove() removes from the collection
[08:29:54] <mathi_> I have an infinite loop, can anyone have a look here? http://jsfiddle.net/V84mH/1/
[08:30:02] <xec> mathi: i don't think .remove() removes from the collection
[08:30:14] <xec> mathi: http://jsfiddle.net/V84mH/2/
[08:30:45] <afeijo> I have an $().unbind() that get overriden by another ajax call. I need to make this unbind() live(), how can I do that?
[08:30:56] <mathi_> strange.. what does remove() do then?
[08:31:18] <xec> mathi: remove from DOM
[08:31:44] <DrMabuse|Zz> :D
[08:34:48] <xec> afeijo: i can't make much sense of your question, but it sounds like you just need to use delegates or .on() rather than .bind() ?
[08:35:44] <Carlitta87> something is wrong....my images not appearing: http://ratebee.jamaica876.com/
[08:35:54] <afeijo> xec, yes it is weird. I have a few elements that I need to prevent to trigger an jquery bind made from a third party code. It works with unbind(), but after the first ajax callback is executed, my unbind() got replaced again
[08:36:32] <xec> afeijo: you don't happen to have any sort of control over this 3rd party code do you?
[08:36:40] <afeijo> no
[08:36:54] <DrMabuse|Zz> @Carlitta87 http://ratebee.jamaica876.com/images/1.jpg 404
[08:37:07] <ngharo> afeijo: whats differentiates the elements you want to unbind from the others?
[08:37:16] <DrMabuse|Zz> maybe this the exception :)
[08:38:42] <xec> afeijo: then you're not going to be able to have an elegant solution, maybe you can listen to "ajaxComplete" event and keepd doing .unbind() after every ajax call or something freaky like that
[08:38:44] <afeijo> ngharo, it is inside a div of mine
[08:39:05] <afeijo> xec ajaxComplete, sound like it, I will google about, thanks
[08:39:39] <DrMabuse|Zz> @afeijo success:
[08:39:48] <ngharo> afeijo: oh, i misread your question.  nm
[08:39:55] <ngharo> can you paste the code
[08:39:56] <ngharo> ?p
[08:39:57] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:40:30] <z0ned> anyone ever worked with google maps polygons?
[08:40:41] <jedimind> you're a polygon
[08:40:43] <DrMabuse|Zz> +
[08:40:46] <z0ned> lol.
[08:42:10] <z0ned> i have a map with a listener attached so a user can click points to draw a polygon. when you call polygon.setEditable(true), there are vertices that you can click and move around. i'm trying to add a listener so that when you edit the polgyon in any way, it updates a spot on the page with all the new vertices. can't seem to figure out how to do this
[08:43:47] <z0ned> i would think you'd have to attach a listener to every vertex which would do something like $("#verticesTxt").text(polygon.getPaths()); but i can't seem to find out how to attach a listener to a vertex
[08:44:48] <DrMabuse|Zz> @sec ready  ?
[08:44:54] <DrMabuse|Zz> @xec

[08:53:29] <fof> huh
[08:53:50] <joshualibrarian> How can I use an attribute name="var[]" ?  Jquery keeps giving me an error.  I tried 'name="var[]"' and it's closer.  :)
[08:54:22] <nickelnick> can you try and escape it?
[08:54:24] <ajpiano> ?escaping
[08:54:24] <nickelnick> \
[08:54:24] <bot-t> If you wish to use any of the meta-characters (#;&,.+*~':"!^$[]()=>|/ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\. http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ Also this is probably a bad idea, but... http://j.mp/autoescapeselector
[08:54:47] <nickelnick> hey adam how are you dude
[08:55:02] <ajpiano> i'm good
[08:55:09] <afeijo> xec, it worked! thanks
[08:55:18] <afeijo> he left? ah
[08:56:53] <brinnandeskepp> hello
[08:58:40] <Eruadan> why there's so few ppl here #ajax ?
[08:59:14] <nickelnick> why would you hang out in ajax tho
[08:59:20] <nickelnick> why not just javascript or jquery
[08:59:30] <nickelnick> :)
[08:59:56] <fof> they moved to #mrmuscle
[09:01:17] <Eruadan> nickelnick, mmm, not sure, i'm just a newbie. I thought ajax was very important, thus the need for a separated channel. I do know it's connect with jquery
[09:02:18] <cacts> is there an easy way to check if any of an element's parents is a particular other element
[09:02:50] <ajpiano> cacts: see ?$.contains
[09:02:51] <bot-t> cacts, :contains() Selector - Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[09:02:53] <ajpiano> meh
[09:02:56] <ajpiano> see ?jQuery.contains
[09:02:56] <bot-t> jQuery.contains(container, contained): Check to see if a DOM element is within another DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[09:03:05] <Eruadan> nickelnick, so if i have ajax related questions, should i just pop here or maybe #javascript is better?
[09:03:24] <Jon47> Eruadan you can do ajax with jquery but you don't need jquery to do ajaxâ¦ if you're just interested in help with how asynchronous HTTP requests work, i'm sure there's people in here that can help with that, or try #javascript .. if you want help with the jquery ajax api, then we're here for ya
[09:03:28] <cacts> ajpiano, i need to go backwards.  i'm getting the child element and i want to see if it is a certain container
[09:03:47] <ajpiano> cacts: that still will work
[09:03:56] <Eruadan> Jon47, thanks, cool
[09:03:59] <cacts> i would have to do .contains on a lot of parent containers, i think it'd be quite ineffiecient
[09:04:04] <Eruadan> Jon47++
[09:04:07] <ajpiano> cacts: what, nope.
[09:04:19] <joshualibrarian> ajpiano: but do I need to escape it in the HTML itself? I'm not even trying to access it with a selector in jquery, but just having it on the html page is crashing on load.
[09:04:20] <sven_oostenbrink> I want that if somebody is on my page, they go to another tab, or window, and when they come back, that the focus is on a specific textbox.. I tried $(document).focus(function(){$('#textbox').focus();}); but that doesnt do anything.. What am I doing wrong here?
[09:04:21] <ajpiano> cacts: are you looking for a direct parent relationship
[09:04:33] <ajpiano> or just the fact that an element is contained
[09:04:48] <cacts> no, i have an array of parent div IDs, and i want to check if the passed in element is a child of any of them
[09:05:02] <cacts> and also, find the id of the parent it is in, if any
[09:05:58] <ajpiano> $( array.join() ).filter(function() { return $(this).find( yourElement ).lenght }).attr("id")
[09:06:06] <ajpiano> +spelling*
[09:06:30] <cacts> what will that do if it isn't in any of them?
[09:06:37] <cacts> undefined?
[09:06:51] <ajpiano> yes, you wouldn't *really* want to just tack on the ID
[09:06:59] <cacts> gotcha
[09:07:32] <ajpiano> var $el = $( array.join() ).filter(function() { return $(this).find( yourElement ).length }); if ($el.length) { console.log( el[0].id ); }
[09:07:54] <sphinxxx> hey i'm trying to set custom headers in an ajax request, i've done it in the "beforeSend" event on the xhr object,  but when I look at the request, the headers are showing up inside of "Access-Control-Request-Headers:"
[09:08:12] <unclemantis> any twitter bootstrap people in here? Maybe I can get some help https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/2037
[09:08:13] <socialhapy> â Issue #2037 on bootstrap, reported by gigdates (26m, 26s ago): Type error for scrollSpy after 1.4 to 2.x upgrade
[09:08:15] <unclemantis> thanks
[09:08:55] <unclemantis> ok now that is neat
[09:14:32] <sphinxxx> anyone?
[09:16:12] <drakythe> If I want to string together multiple .hide/.shows into a single if (as in show this one, hide those 3) do I end each line with a ; or just a , ?
[09:17:25] <drakythe> nm, got my answer I think
[09:18:14] <johnkpaul> drakythe: comma is not a statement separator in javascript, you should use a semicolon
[09:18:15] <DerekPioneer> i'm trying to use append() and load() to display and hide a "loading..." gif

[09:20:48] <Nuno147> Anyway can help with a queryUI question ?
[09:22:29] <blindMoe> does unbind() detach events that were bound with .live()  ?
[09:23:12] <blindMoe> I have a click handler that is being run twice on click... I am binding it like this:  $('#foo').unbind('click').live('click', function() { alert('bar'); });
[09:23:12] <Nuno147> I am using queryUI dialog for confirmation. so I have an <a href> which when clicked should show the dialog and if the user will press "OK" it should move forward to the <a href> link. if "NO" it should stay in the same page. I have the dialog poped up when pressing on the <a href> but I do not know how can I send it to the link *only* when the OK button clicked. any idea ?
[09:24:11] <sven_oostenbrink> I have a page with one textbox and various other components.. I want at all cost that text input focus stays on that textbox, nowhere else.. so I did $('#text').blur(function(){$('#text').focus();}); but that is not working... Anybody knows why?
[09:25:08] <sven_oostenbrink> Actually, jQuery does take the blur() event (checked that with a console.log()) but when I reaply the focus, it doesnt apply the focus..
[09:26:01] <ajpiano> Nuno147: in the OK button, do a window.location to the url of the href
[09:26:45] <nickelnick> what is text? an input?
[09:26:51] <cacts> ajpiano, i'm having trouble getting that to work
[09:26:51] <nickelnick> #text
[09:27:02] <cacts> should my array have the IDs prepended with a #?
[09:27:03] <ajpiano> my deepest sympathies
[09:27:06] <ajpiano> cacts: yes.
[09:27:07] <sven_oostenbrink> nickelnick: yes, an <input type='text' id='text'>
[09:27:44] <blindMoe> anyone have any ideas why a click event handler would be getting called twice on a single click?
[09:27:49] <nickelnick> i don't recall but you might check to see if text is a reserved word or something
[09:29:16] <sven_oostenbrink> nickelnick: well, its not #text, its another id actually, I just put text to make it shorter to type :) the .focus() event works when I place it on other events, but it does NOT work from within the .blur() event from itself. I am sure the .blur() event was called, checked that with console.log
[09:29:51] <blindMoe> hrmm I guess .unbind() doesn't work for events that were bound with .live()
[09:31:08] <nickelnick> perhaps you need to unbind the selector
[09:31:13] <nickelnick> for blur...first
[09:31:30] <nickelnick> at least, I would try that, not sure it makes a diff
[09:31:50] <nickelnick> in your callback
[09:32:44] <aqeel> hi room
[09:33:09] <johnkpaul> blindMoe: it does, but you need to have additional arguments
[09:33:13] <aqeel> any know to to center the 3n+3 nth child in center
[09:33:19] <johnkpaul> to specifiy to which element it was _actually_ bound to
[09:33:54] <aqeel> default li is float left....3n+3 is float right
[09:34:20] <aqeel> 3n+2 touches the left li.........i have these li into 3 columns
[09:34:57] <aqeel> sorry 3n+2 not 3n+3
[09:36:42] <Zzaichik> aqeel: you could target with .next() on that 3n+3 li. I'd say add a classname or something.
[09:37:22] <aqeel> ut then i need to ad class to every that 3n+3 li element
[09:37:27] <aqeel> but*
[09:37:32] <aqeel> add*
[09:38:18] <Zzaichik> is that bad?
[09:38:36] <aqeel> nope but i tought i could use jquery to input the css...
[09:39:07] <aqeel> so how do i center it
[09:39:26] <aqeel> text-align will align contents within
[09:39:42] <aqeel> and not li element itself
[09:40:06] <Icham> Hi jQuery
[09:40:08] <Zzaichik> aqeel: off the top of my headâ¦. li:nth-child(3n+3)').next().addClass('center-li');
[09:41:01] <aqeel> and having applied to ul will effect all elements....well thanks but i was asking how to center....
[09:41:31] <aqeel> becuse textalign will center li contents and not li itself
[09:43:38] <Zzaichik> Use margins and width.  I'm assuming you're floating all li's?
[09:43:58] <aqeel> well yes and i have % width on all li
[09:44:06] <Zzaichik> ahh
[09:44:11] <aqeel> that is the problem......%
[09:44:24] <blindMoe> is there a way to trigger an event when the value of variable changes?
[09:44:30] <Zzaichik> yes, yes it is. See now I understand a little better.
[09:44:38] <nickelnick> sure
[09:44:40] <nickelnick> well
[09:44:55] <nickelnick> blindMoe: i think you would have to do something like setInterval
[09:45:05] <blindMoe> hrmm ok
[09:45:09] <nickelnick> wait now
[09:45:17] <nickelnick> variable changes how...by user or by dynamic content
[09:45:22] <nickelnick> is this an input?
[09:45:26] <blindMoe> nope
[09:45:29] <Zzaichik> aqeel: I would change the width of that center li a bit and make up for it with margin %
[09:45:30] <nickelnick> or just a raw text value
[09:45:35] <blindMoe> raw text variable
[09:45:53] <nickelnick> is it wrapped in a span with an id or something?
[09:45:59] <blindMoe> nope
[09:46:13] <nickelnick> you need a way to get the value inside by wrapping it
[09:46:24] <blindMoe> I guess I could store it in an element that jquery could watch
[09:46:35] <nickelnick> then doing something like $('span#somespanid').val();
[09:46:42] <nickelnick> err
[09:46:47] <nickelnick> with the setInterval
[09:47:16] <nickelnick> if it were user changed you could easily use something like .live('keyup'....etc
[09:47:39] <blindMoe> 'I think I am just going to write a setter for the variable and work it into my existing code so I can just add a call in there
[09:47:42] <blindMoe> but thanks for the ideas
[09:47:52] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html.......................click sm
[09:47:55] <DrMabuse|Zz> use on.('change',function)
[09:48:03] <aqeel> see source code
[09:48:12] <nickelnick> sure thing, i suppose another thing you might be able to do is use regex to parse
[09:48:24] <nickelnick> which sounds to me, like a lot more work than just changing your php
[09:48:25] <nickelnick> or whatever
[09:48:59] <aqeel> Zzaichik.....can give it a try...at my site
[09:49:13] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html.......................click sm
[09:50:14] <Zzaichik> alright click what?
[09:50:21] <aqeel> sm
[09:50:29] <aqeel> left bottom
[09:51:37] <aqeel> Zzaichik............as u can see second column is touching 1st column
[09:54:34] <Zzaichik> aqeel: So change the width of #smc li {width: 29%;} and than the margin left of the center li to 2%
[09:55:22] <aqeel> well that be dead center?
[09:56:43] <Zzaichik> should be pretty damn close.
[09:57:02] <z0ned> if i'm writing one function that handles two events, should i use .on(), or just specify the two events?
[09:58:21] <Zzaichik> Go test it and see, man. Do you see what I did though? So now you can play with the CSS and make it perfect.
[09:58:44] <aqeel> i can do that
[09:59:09] <aqeel> well i am thinking of using some mathematics.......
[10:00:00] <Zzaichik> You can if you want, seems unnecessary to me but you can do whatever. what I did should be pretty damn close to center.
[10:00:51] <Zzaichik> I mean, you don't need to do any fancy algorithms, all you need jQuery for is to add some CSS or better yet, just add a classname and then put the css in your stylesheet. keep you JS clean.
[10:01:23] <aqeel> agree....but i prefer dead center.....thanks for help............(width of div - width of li )/2...........something along those lines
[10:01:33] <kevindougans> $('.btn').click( function(e){ $(this).attr('class','btn-success'); }   <- can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong here???
[10:01:51] <kevindougans> its not changing the class of the button
[10:02:24] <aqeel> use add class or toggleclass
[10:02:29] <kevindougans> ok thanks
[10:02:57] <Zzaichik> kevindougans:  no .attr()  use addClass() or toggleClass().. like aqeel said. ;)
[10:04:10] <kevindougans> $(this).addClass('btn-success');
[10:04:13] <kevindougans> doesn't work
[10:04:17] <kevindougans> grrrrrrr
[10:04:22] <kevindougans> one day i'm gonna get my head round this
[10:04:45] <Zzaichik> kevindougans:  jsfiddle.net is your.. and our friend.
[10:05:06] <Zzaichik> are you adding the .btn element after the dom is loaded?
[10:05:09] <Nuno147> I have a strange problem : I am using JqueryUI to display a dialog. the dialog is shown when the user press on a hyperlink on the page. I have a div at the end of the body section of the HTML which is the dialog data I wish to display ( that is how it works in jqueryUI). Everything works fine but the I am also able to see the div at the end of the page. how can I make it invisble ?
[10:05:15] <e-dard> I'm new to JQuery and AJAX. I'm currently working on a tool where I will need to assign unique codes to new visitors for a certain period of time, and display those codes on the webpage the visitor is viewing. Because this is an addition to a production e-commerce site I'm building it out as a separate web-service and will then add a JQuery snippet to the site's main templates that will do an AJAX call and receive back the 
[10:05:16] <e-dard> etc. Our main site is www.example.com, and the web-service I'm writing will be on numbers.example.com. I'm worried about the whole "no cross-domain AJAX" calls. I assume I'm OK with the current setup, but what if I wanted to say host the web-service on Heroku or something?
[10:06:13] <aqeel> nuno147 display:hidden..............css property
[10:06:35] <kevindougans> Zzaichik: the buttons already there in the simple html markup
[10:06:43] <kevindougans> hang on i'll try get it on this jsfiddle
[10:06:59] <Zzaichik> gracias
[10:07:04] <Nuno147> aqeel , thanks !
[10:07:43] <Nuno147> works like a charm :) thanks.
[10:07:50] <aqeel> any time
[10:09:36] <Zzaichik> holy shit I'm tired
[10:10:06] <aqeel> zzaichik ......what exactly is your code block
[10:10:21] <Zzaichik> huh?
[10:10:41] <Zzaichik> I'm just hanging out and not working on what I need to be.
[10:10:42] <IceTrAiN> did you just try to troubleshoot his tiredness?
[10:10:43] <aqeel> where u want the class changed
[10:10:49] <Zzaichik> baahah
[10:10:50] <kevindougans> Zzaichik: http://jsfiddle.net/zw5yh/
[10:11:12] <kevindougans> when you click the approve button
[10:11:16] <kevindougans> it sends an ajax request
[10:11:18] <kevindougans> which works fine
[10:11:38] <kevindougans> but i need it to change the button class from "btw" to "btn-success"
[10:12:03] <aqeel> sorry zzaichik.......teasing
[10:12:09] <aqeel> ;)
[10:12:18] <Zzaichik> lol
[10:13:01] <Zzaichik> kevindougans:  ahh - remove the add class form the ajax call
[10:13:19] <Zzaichik> oh wait..
[10:13:26] <Zzaichik> I see what you're doing.
[10:13:46] <unclemantis> any twitter bootstrap people in here? Maybe I can get some help https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/2037
[10:13:47] <socialhapy> â Issue #2037 on bootstrap, reported by gigdates (1h, 32m ago): Type error for scrollSpy after 1.4 to 2.x upgrade
[10:16:50] <sphinxxx> how can you properly set custom headers on an ajax request?
[10:17:04] <Zzaichik> kevindougans: you're reference to $(this) is being thrown off (I believe).  put  var that = $(this);  under your prevent Default and then call var that inside your ajax success
[10:17:13] <sphinxxx> xhr.setRequestHeader  doesn't seem to put them in the right place
[10:17:29] <kevindougans> ok i'll try that thanks
[10:17:29] <sphinxxx> it puts it within another header "Access-Control-Request-Headers"
[10:20:46] <kevindougans> http://jsfiddle.net/zw5yh/3/
[10:20:49] <kevindougans> syntax error now

[10:21:06] <Zzaichik> http://jsfiddle.net/ZzaichikK/zw5yh/4/
[10:21:30] <Zzaichik> thisbutton needs to be $(thisbutton).addClass...
[10:22:40] <kevindougans> ok i copy pasted yours but the page refreshes
[10:23:36] <kevindougans> works fine in jsfiddle
[10:23:45] <kevindougans> but refreshes in the real world
[10:24:56] <Zzaichik> kevindougans:   weirdâ¦ the success resp isn't doing that?
[10:25:09] <kevindougans> yeh i know, very weird.
[10:25:14] <Zzaichik> The .btn shouldn't be refreshingâ¦   hmmm..
[10:25:52] <kevindougans> hmm
[10:25:55] <kevindougans> on firebug

[10:30:20] <kevindougans> Zzaichik: http://mambo.3thirteen.co.uk/madmin/tweets/new
[10:33:25] <Zzaichik> it doesn't like the ending });   for some reason.
[10:34:22] <Zzaichik> if I put the cursor on that last line and hit delete /backspace once, it doesn't delete the semicolon and then it seems to work.
[10:34:32] <kevindougans> i think i have some more javascript underneath
[10:34:32] <Zzaichik> what the...
[10:34:38] <kevindougans> but
[10:34:40] <kevindougans> works fine
[10:34:43] <kevindougans> on other pages
[10:35:01] <Zzaichik> yeah it doesn't seem to be copy/pasting over very well
[10:35:14] <kevindougans> hmm
[10:35:31] <Zzaichik> it's picking up something on that last line. Or at least that's what I'm seeing.
[10:35:39] <kevindougans> ok
[10:35:40] <kevindougans> fixed.
[10:35:54] <Zzaichik> that fix it?
[10:35:59] <kevindougans> i deleted the last "});"
[10:36:01] <kevindougans> and retyped it
[10:36:03] <kevindougans> });
[10:36:05] <kevindougans> working now

[10:38:44] <DrMabuse|Zz> ok done :)
[10:38:57] <DrMabuse|Zz> fancy scrolling works
[10:40:11] <ohcibi> hi, i have a setup like this: http://jsfiddle.net/5FHnA/1/ nothing special happened here, the link-tag just gets inserted into <head>, however on this example www.dwgadf.de/video the <link>-tag gets inserted twice (using firefox 9), which happens not if i put the <script>-block into <head> (causing the player not to work, so its no option). anybody has an idea whats wrong?
[10:40:58] <DrMabuse|Zz> you have try CData ?
[10:41:20] <mod> Does jquery have a simplified way to check for empty form field values?
[10:41:28] <DrMabuse|Zz> and why you add css with js ?
[10:42:07] <Zzaichik> mod: http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[10:42:21] <mod> i have a somewhat expensive function that will comprehensively check
[10:42:21] <Whirl3d> which is better? Binding an event handler to an element and triggering it when needed, or storing the event handler in the element's data object and calling it when needed?
[10:42:34] <LukeNukem> can i pm someone for support?
[10:42:36] <mod> hmm i thought that was DOM structure related
[10:42:45] <LukeNukem> because in the channel all i get is suggestions to other stuff
[10:42:51] <mod> "Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM."
[10:43:18] <Zzaichik> set in a conditional  if($('element').empty() { return false; });
[10:43:19] <ohcibi> DrMabuse|Zz: i tried it with cdata... to load it dynamically via js when its needed..
[10:43:20] <mod> Zzaichik ^^
[10:43:23] <DrMabuse|Zz> @mod when done is empty :D
[10:43:43] <Zzaichik> ^^^  blur()
[10:43:53] <mod> erm.. i don't get it..
[10:44:21] <mod> DrMabuse, "done"?
[10:44:42] <mod> the docs say:
[10:44:45] <mod> $('.hello').empty();
[10:44:53] <Zzaichik> $('element').blur(function() { if($(this).empty()) {alert('cant be empty!');});
[10:44:53] <mod> We can target any element for removal:
[10:44:55] <DrMabuse|Zz> no good idea
[10:44:58] <DrMabuse|Zz> i think
[10:45:22] <DrMabuse|Zz> empty() remove it
[10:45:51] <mod> ok so empty() is not a DOM manipulator like the docs say?
[10:45:59] <DrMabuse|Zz> try $(this).text() != ''
[10:46:08] <DrMabuse|Zz> notempty
[10:46:13] <mod> DrMabuse, that is not comprehensive enough
[10:46:15] <ohcibi> DrMabuse|Zz: but dont mind, i was just asking for ideas... i put a <link>-tag in <body> now to solve the actual problem...   i think i should work on the web-app to solve this properly, but i was just wondering why this happens
[10:46:57] <DrMabuse|Zz> ohcibi you try document .write ?
[10:47:19] <eddiemonge> <link> in the body?
[10:47:20] <Zzaichik> ?document.write
[10:47:23] <ohcibi> DrMabuse|Zz: before i manipulate the dom with document.write i'lll put a link in body 8-))
[10:47:23] <bot-t> Zzaichik, #11199 (document.write in ready())  jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 4 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11199
[10:49:19] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: i know its ugly, but this is the first time i need dynamic css in this app and its not clear that i'll develop that app further, so i left it ugly now...
[10:50:59] <ag4ve> is the only way to specify a parameter name for a get request to have a form action, or is there something within the ajax method i've missed?
[10:51:34] <eddiemonge> ohcibi: i dont think thats even valid. yeah browsers allow it but its a hack
[10:51:48] <eddiemonge> ag4ve: data
[10:53:02] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: as i said: its not clear that i'll develop that app further.... if i do so i'll write it from scratch anyway, so i really dont care about hacks in this app anymore 8-)
[10:53:19] <ag4ve> eddiemonge: cool, thanks
[10:53:40] <Whirl3d> If I do this $(elem).data("item",$(someItem)); then I can access "someItem"'s methods with $(elem).data("someItem").attr("id"); for example. I can even do var si=$(elem).data("someitem"); console.log(si.attr('id")); but if $(someitem) is a jquery object of length==0, I get si==undefined rather than the empty jquery item.
[10:54:18] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: but i totally agree with you...
[10:54:26] <theBrettman>  will $.post(url, {data: $('form').serialize(),}); pass the fields into post vars the right way or do I have to do it for each field individually?
[10:54:36] <DrMabuse|Zz> so it use Yii this register css for me
[10:54:54] <ohcibi> DrMabuse|Zz: ?
[10:54:56] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: dont do that
[10:55:24] <DrMabuse|Zz> yii-framework
[10:55:25] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: $.post(url, $('form').serialize() );
[10:55:36] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: you dont need the data part
[10:55:40] <Whirl3d> I was hoping it was going to be a good way to coerce jquery objects to report "undefined" for collections of 0 length.
[10:55:48] <theBrettman> eddiemonge, I have to add more vars to data tho...
[10:56:00] <ohcibi> DrMabuse|Zz: i assumed a subject at that place in your sentence but i still dont get it 8-))
[10:56:03] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: dont store jq objects in data. why would you do that?
[10:56:05] <theBrettman> for wordpress... have to add action and nonce
[10:56:40] <Whirl3d> quicker access to the jq object, or when the selector for the jq object is not public
[10:56:42] <ohcibi> theBrettman: use serializeArray() and put the addiitional vars into the array
[10:56:55] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: thats still a bad idea. just use a variable
[10:57:09] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: there's nothing wrong with storing a jq object in another's data
[10:57:11] <theBrettman> I will have to look that up
[10:57:38] <theBrettman> is there a doc bot?
[10:57:48] <ohcibi> ?serializeArray
[10:57:48] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[10:57:54] <theBrettman> aha, thx
[10:58:29] <ohcibi> theBrettman: the arraystructure is a bit odd on the first sight
[10:58:33] <ohcibi> imo
[10:58:40] <domcat> any ideas why the site jumps to bottom when I click on a link while using bbq hashchange?
[10:58:50] <domcat> there are no errors in console
[10:58:55] <Whirl3d> eddiemonge, the problem with just using a varialble is scope. Sometimes, I don't have access to an items local varialbles and the data object provides a remedy for that.
[10:59:08] <kevrom> I need to be pointed in the right direction.  I'm using flexslider plugin and trying to load all the images via json.   The images are loading into the DOM, but aren't being displayed.  http://ellender.sticky-keys.com/   Feel free to let me know what I can do better JS-wise also
[10:59:42] <eddiemonge> ajpiano: nothing wrong but i still think its a bad idea
[11:00:01] <Whirl3d> how do you get around scope issues, then?
[11:00:21] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: that really has no basis in fact
[11:00:21] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: custom namespaces
[11:00:51] <eddiemonge> ajpiano: i can see someone carelessly doing something like $("div").data( $("a") );
[11:01:31] <ajpiano> the idea that something that is useful is a bad idea when implemented inappropriately is not news to anyway
[11:01:37] <ajpiano> anyone*
[11:01:44] <domcat> any ideas?
[11:03:22] <ohcibi> ajpiano: seeing Whirl3d's problem, it seems that a jq-object from data() behaves different like a normal one, so this would be a reason to not do this at the moment, but maybe he just did something else wrong, in which case i also dont know why it should be bad 8-))
[11:03:24] <Whirl3d> so, eddiemonge, if you have a dom element that represents a collection of elements that each represent a food item and you have a function that places those food items in a custom order based on the private preferences of that dom element, how would you tell that dom element to show it's favorites without exposing it's preferences?
[11:03:31] <ajpiano> that's not true
[11:03:37] <ajpiano> a jquery object behaves like a jquery object
[11:03:51] <ajpiano> he's having some other problem which is that he's checking for data on no elements :)
[11:04:17] <ajpiano> and has to just do a check that's appropriate to see that he's matched an element first.
[11:04:18] <ohcibi> ajpiano: i said, maybe he did something else wrong... i didnt inspected it that intensive 8))
[11:04:30] <eddiemonge> kevrom: does the slider work without the ajax part?
[11:04:59] <ajpiano> well, it's always wise to give something a decent look before you resort to explaining it with conjecture ;)
[11:05:15] <kevrom> eddiemonge: let me find out, i suppose i should have tried that, was so focused on the ajax not working
[11:05:28] <ohcibi> ajpiano: in fact i just tried to answer the question why it should be bad myself 8-))
[11:05:55] <eddiemonge> ajpiano: ill defer to you on this then
[11:07:24] <Whirl3d> so, ajpiano, why is it that if I do: $(elem).data("myCollection",$(".someCollection")) when $(".someCollection').length==0 and then later do console.log($(elem).data("myCollection").length) I get undefined?
[11:07:35] <eddiemonge> kevrom: dom-wise it looks right
[11:08:22] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: do you have a demo of it failing
[11:11:07] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/YDcwq/
[11:11:14] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: 0, not undefined ^
[11:11:38] <kevrom> eddiemonge: dom-wise it does look fine
[11:11:53] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: i just did the same thing 8-)) http://jsfiddle.net/QqNXW/
[11:14:50] <sirblacksoul> hey there I have a little problem in my javascript logic, the gallery @ http://mixniko.de/template/ switches Images like it should, but the caption mostly after the secound slide, is wrong. The Caption simply is the Name of the Image and on the end the index of the caption
[11:15:01] <sirblacksoul> would be very cool if you could help me :)
[11:16:19] <kevrom> eddiemonge: tested with static images and it works fine.. so maybe something to do with the images not being loaded into the DOM when flexslider is firing?
[11:19:00] <tinbox> trying to figure out how to simulate an Enter key press event, anyone willing to help out?
[11:20:44] <tinbox> anyone actually here today?
[11:21:22] <Whirl3d> Okay, here's what I am doing wrong: I store a reference to a dom element in the data object of an element and then remove the dom element referenced: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/pnADN/2/ (slightly different issue, but along the same lines).
[11:21:44] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: simlpe
[11:21:50] <ajpiano> .remove destroys element data and events :p
[11:21:57] <ajpiano> use .detach() if you don't want that to happen
[11:22:04] <gnarf> what ajpiano said
[11:22:24] <Whirl3d> I want the element removed
[11:22:37] <ajpiano> use detach
[11:22:37] <Whirl3d> the data is being stored in an element that isnt being removed
[11:22:40] <gnarf> ?detach
[11:22:40] <bot-t> .detach([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[11:22:42] <monk12> anyone know if .append() handles shortcuts like $('someDiv').append('<ul class="error">'); ?
[11:22:50] <monk12> so dont need to close tag
[11:22:51] <ajpiano> oh
[11:22:53] <eddiemonge> kevrom: you should move the init part into the success callback maybe
[11:23:27] <Whirl3d> The removed element should not be accessable (as it might be with detatched)
[11:23:50] <Whirl3d> so storing a reference to it in an element's data object should destroy the reference when the item is removed
[11:23:57] <Whirl3d> so what I am I doing wrong?
[11:24:26] <eddiemonge> huh?
[11:24:44] <gnarf> Whirl3d: thats not going to happen, if you store a reference to anything, it won't automagically be "removed" from that reference either
[11:25:24] <gnarf> .remove() removes stuff from the DOM, and also destroys all data caches on the removed objects
[11:25:34] <gnarf> .detach() just removes from the dom, but leaves data intact
[11:25:56] <eddiemonge> ?tias @ monk12
[11:25:56] <bot-t> monk12, Try It And See
[11:26:07] <monk12> :). k.
[11:26:07] <tinbox> So, I can get the alert to trigger, but it doesn't actually simulate the Enter key being pressed:  http://jsfiddle.net/fTP8Y/
[11:26:57] <Whirl3d> I figured that the jquery collection was a pointer to the collection of actual dom elements
[11:27:11] <gnarf> tinbox: like you want the browser to pretend that enter was pressed? not gonna happen
[11:29:23] <tinbox> gnarf: thats not possible?
[11:29:41] <kevrom> eddiemonge: thanks man, I appreciate the help.  thought about what you said and just passed the callback to the DOM-creation function. works now
[11:29:46] <gnarf> tinbox: nope - are you trying to trigger a "submit" on the parent form?
[11:30:03] <eddiemonge> tinbox: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/fTP8Y/1/
[11:30:36] <tinbox> gnarf: no, i have an input field that allows users to enter tags...but the tag only gets entered if the user hits the ENTER KEY or the TAB KEY....sometimes users dont know to hit ENTER or TAB and they just click off the input field
[11:31:10] <gnarf> tinbox: sounds like you need to redesign that code and also have it be fired on a blur
[11:31:38] <tinbox> eddiemonge: I don't think anything is working there
[11:31:53] <tinbox> gnarf: damn....cause its part of a plugin im using
[11:32:04] <tinbox> and i wanted to avoid hacking it
[11:32:15] <dilvie> tinbox: add blur?
[11:32:20] <eddiemonge> tinbox:  did you look at the console?
[11:32:28] <tinbox> eddiemonge: checking...
[11:32:35] <chrislabeard> you guys know why if i'm using this line in Firefox it returns a negative value but in chrome it returns a positive value? -- image.css('marginLeft', (-(image.width() - image.parent().width()) / 2) + "px");
[11:33:02] <tinbox> dilvie: well i didn't build the plugin, its this pretty crazy addon for ExpressionEngine CMS that I'm using
[11:34:06] <eddiemonge> tinbox: your way was not good since the keypress would get re-binded every time the field was blurred. and dont use live
[11:34:38] <tinbox> eddiemonge: but gnarf is saying its impossible for the browser to act as if the user actually hit the ENTER key
[11:34:56] <Emn1ty> Is it faster to refresh the page and use a session/get to sort a large series of information or is it faster to do it with ajax? I feel ajax is kinda slow comparatively
[11:35:19] <gnarf> tinbox: if you are just wanting to trigger an event handler bound by jQuery thats completely different
[11:35:37] <gnarf> we simulate that all over the place in jQuery UI's test suite to test our handlers
[11:35:55] <eddiemonge> tinbox: again, did you look at the console of the code i linked you?
[11:36:15] <tinbox> gnarf: i dont really care how i do it, i just need the the input field to "think" that the user hit ENTER or TAB when the click off the field
[11:37:03] <eddiemonge> tinbox: but i agree with gnarf that it sounds like you need to reevaluate
[11:37:29] <eddiemonge> chrislabeard: What is chrome/firefox return for image.width() and image.parent().width() ?
[11:37:41] <andrew_mcc> Hello all, I'm using getScript to get a script that has an aleart() and the alert works, but when I remove the alert and do a ('p').click function, the function does not work, unless the alert() preceeds it
[11:38:22] <chrislabeard> eddiemonge: oh it looks like chrome is returning 0 for the width
[11:39:06] <gnarf> tinbox: you can do what you're thinking about doing, but its like using a hammer to tighten a screw
[11:39:07] <eddiemonge> ?eval -0/2
[11:39:09] <bot-t> eddiemonge: 0
[11:39:38] <chrislabeard> so why is that firefox can get the width but not chrome?
[11:39:46] <gnarf> chrislabeard: has the image actually loaded yet?
[11:39:48] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ andrew_mcc
[11:39:49] <bot-t> andrew_mcc, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:39:50] <gnarf> ?imagesLoaded
[11:39:51] <bot-t> imagesLoaded() A small jQuery plugin that triggers a callback after all the selected/child images have been loaded. Because you can't do .load() on cached images. - https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[11:39:52] <tinbox> gnarf: LOL, i hear that...but I feel like it might be worse to have to go through someone elses who module to know what to modify
[11:40:09] <andrew_mcc> ajax.andrewmcconville.com
[11:40:28] <gnarf> tinbox: if the "plugin" you're using is broken, fix it and send your fix to the authors
[11:40:37] <gnarf> i assume its an open source thing, likely on github
[11:41:08] <ngharo> kinda related: is is truely impossible to mimic ENTER keypress?  The w3 lists KeyboardEvent attributes as read only, but maybe you hackers know of a way.
[11:41:16] <ngharo> this is for a virtual keyboard
[11:41:34] <andrew_mcc> page one has no alert() so the .click won't work. page two has an alert() and the .click works @ eddiemonge
[11:41:34] <gnarf> tbh - whatever behavior they are tying to "enter or tab" should be tied to another event/method you could trigger whenever you want to
[11:42:53] <chrislabeard> gnarf: so I need to use that to make sure the images load
[11:43:05] <eddiemonge> andrew_mcc: you either need to do the getscript in the .load() callback or use delegation
[11:43:31] <eddiemonge> andrew_mcc: also, clicking the links multiple times will keep re-binding those event handlers. something to think about
[11:43:49] <tinbox> gnarf: its actually a commercial addon...and you're right...i should probably harass the author
[11:44:14] <eddiemonge> ngharo: if its to put a carriage return, you could just put the carriage return
[11:44:41] <ngharo> eddiemonge: yeah, it's not :(
[11:44:44] <eddiemonge> tinbox: if its a commercial product and it doesnt work, get them to fix it or get your money back
[11:44:48] <eddiemonge> ngharo: then?
[11:45:58] <ngharo> eddiemonge: its a touchscreen appliance where I have a jquery powered vkboard injected into every webpage the user loads that is actived on any input focus
[11:46:22] <andrew_mcc> thank you very much that worked @ eddiemonge
[11:46:30] <ngharo> forms like facebook comments don't have submit buttons so the user is boned
[11:47:17] <eddiemonge> ngharo: trigger a blur event
[11:47:28] <eddiemonge> ngharo: thats usually what its looking for anyway
[11:48:27] <ngharo> negatory
[11:48:37] <andrew_mcc> i'm not up to speed on binding, got any tips for me on what problem i'll be running into? @ eddiemonge
[11:48:40] <ngharo> i call submit() on the form which works for every other case
[11:48:43] <ngharo> except facebook
[11:52:25] <eddiemonge> andrew_mcc: you could unbind and then rebind or else find a way to now have to load scripts
[11:52:43] <eddiemonge> ngharo: did you try calling blur on those elements?
[11:53:04] <eddiemonge> hmm i see what you mean
[11:53:46] <eddiemonge> submit should work though
[11:54:02] <jeffsmykil_> Does anyone know of a solution to get AutoCad maps into canvas?
[11:54:25] <ngharo> eddiemonge: you'd think so.  it takes me to the form action url instead of submitting ajax style
[11:55:53] <jancel> try e.preventDefault() and make sure it's not erroring before the e.preventDefault() or it will hit the default submit action ngharo
[11:55:56] <DerekPioneer> how would i do something like an onclick event that also loads when the page first loads?
[11:57:06] <jeffsmykil_> call the function on page laod and click
[11:57:08] <jancel> DerekPioneer do one when the page loads and add an .on("click", function(){}) perhaps. You can make the function separate and just call it from the page load and click handlers
[11:58:53] <xckpd7> question: what's the difference betweeen html5 history & pulling stuff in via ajax? not totally getting it
[11:58:57] <eddiemonge> jancel: thats for facebook?
[11:59:42] <eddiemonge> DerekPioneer: like jeffsmykil_ said, bind the click function and then trigger it
[11:59:49] <jancel> eddiemonge it's generic jquery. I wasn't following the conversation.  But I find this is one reason that I have issues with forms submitting regular versus ajax
[12:00:13] <eddiemonge> xckpd7: history is where youve been. pulling stuff in via ajax is pulling stuff in via ajax. completely different
[12:00:37] <eddiemonge> jancel: thought so. this is for a specific use case
[12:01:20] <jancel> xckpd7 history essentially runs off of your browser back and forward buttons, really has nothing to do with ajax, which is client side calls to the server for web interactions
[12:01:43] <xckpd7> yeah but basically look here: http://diveintohtml5.info/history.html
[12:02:15] <xckpd7> they are using a page, grabbing the page id and loading that specific content, and they just changing the history.... which you could already do somewhat with hash pound
[12:02:35] <jeffsmykil_> I know the wrong channel, but does anyone know of an autocad to xml mapping solution?
[12:02:37] <xckpd7> I'm confused because here: http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3112-how-basecamp-next-got-to-be-so-damn-fast-without-using-much-client-side-ui
[12:02:55] <jancel> xckpd7 so in html 4 and older stuff, when you used ajax to roam a user around your website, it was very tedious maintaining history. I.e. most sites back buttons didn't work anymore.
[12:03:05] <xckpd7> it says they are using HTML5 pushState to make the site faster, but it seems like they are just doing basic ajax and using history... don't get it
[12:03:32] <eddiemonge> xckpd7: they are overriding the browsers default behavior.
[12:03:35] <thebignoise> when i run this i get 399
[12:03:36] <babonk> If I want to add an html tag before ($this) one, which query function am i looking for?
[12:03:39] <thebignoise>     $.each($('.tab_width'), function(i, val){
[12:03:39] <thebignoise>         w2 += $(this).outerWidth();
[12:03:39] <thebignoise>     });
[12:03:42] <babonk> *$(this)
[12:03:46] <eddiemonge> ?paste @ babonk
[12:03:47] <bot-t> babonk, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:03:49] <thebignoise> but when i run it in the console i get 432
[12:03:53] <thebignoise> which is the right value
[12:04:07] <babonk> eddiemonge: I'm not the one pasting my code
[12:04:15] <xckpd7> eddie: on the page they say: IT's similar idea .... instead of sending JSON across the wire, we just send regular HTML
[12:04:17] <thebignoise> can someone explain that to me?
[12:04:23] <ngharo> eddiemonge: i found a hidden submit input that fb is calling click() on which i think intercepts the submit event
[12:04:28] <eddiemonge> babonk: but your example is too ambiguous
[12:04:45] <babonk> ediiemonge: I don't think so.  I just want to add an html tag before a given tag
[12:04:51] <babonk> i'm sure there's a function to do that
[12:05:01] <eddiemonge> babonk: oh sorry, misread your question. see ? before
[12:05:02] <bot-t> babonk, .before(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, before each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/before/
[12:05:16] <babonk> will check this out, thanks!
[12:05:25] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ thebignoise

[12:05:25] <xckpd7> eddiemonge: this might be an easier question: what the heck does this do? https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax
[12:05:38] <xckpd7> eddiemonge: I thought ajax already coudl load html from server without a full reload?
[12:05:45] <jancel> thebignoise the width changes dynamically. Your browser being a different size (or even just a different browser) can affect that.
[12:06:03] <eddiemonge> xckpd7: did you read the readme? it says what it does
[12:06:32] <thebignoise> jancel: right. but if the function is called form an external js file and then i call it in the same browser and same page from within the console it should be consistant
[12:06:35] <xckpd7> eddiemonge: of course but I don't get the difference...
[12:06:35] <thebignoise> no?
[12:06:38] <jancel> PJAX sends a request to the server (full request) but only loads the parts that have changed from page to page.  Giving you an "AJAXy" feel
[12:06:54] <xckpd7> jancel: doesn't ajax already do that?
[12:07:39] <jancel> no, AJAX is just communication from your client (web page) to the server. PJAX actually changes the HTML DOM dependent on the content of the call from PJAX
[12:07:40] <xckpd7> they say "full reload" but ajax doesn't full reload
[12:09:18] <mightym> hey guys, I'm new to js/jquery and like to build a site which is scrolling automatic to the left if the cursor is in area at the left side of browser and vice versa. i already checked mousemove and hover. but I'm not sure what  might be a good pattern solving this. someone a hint for me, or maybe a similar example? thx in advance
[12:09:27] <jancel> you can do full reload if you want. Call a url, then replace the html with the html you get back. The point is, you are DOING this, the doing is not Ajax, just the technique to get the data from the server
[12:10:07] <jancel> PJAX makes the doing done for you. So you don't really have to do anything for a fancy looking page.
[12:10:43] <jancel> but you can't use PJAX without AJAX
[12:11:03] <jancel> you can use AJAX without PJAX (because it's a much wider use case)
[12:12:54] <DerekPioneer> having some of what i believe are referred to as "delegate" problems, my on clicks are no longer working
[12:12:59] <eddiemonge> mightym: bind to the mouse over, check the coordinates, if in the hit target, scroll the window
[12:13:02] <DerekPioneer> http://codepad.org/nZZQIqZn
[12:13:43] <sirblacksoul> I have a Problem with my slideshow, could somebody tell me what I did wrong? http://mixniko.de/template/ Captions dosent fit the Image
[12:14:00] <eddiemonge> DerekPioneer: dont add event handlers in event handlers unless you unbind them first otherwise you are going to have multiple handlers
[12:14:27] <DerekPioneer> so basically take everything right there and put it in a function
[12:15:28] <DerekPioneer> still not reading the on click though
[12:16:45] <mightym> eddiemonge: ah ok. and should i use .animate({scrollTop for scrolling the page continuously ? or use sty else?
[12:16:50] <mightym> sth
[12:21:05] <eddiemonge> mightym: thats up to you and what effect you want
[12:21:19] <eddiemonge> ? on delegation @ DerekPioneer
[12:21:19] <bot-t> DerekPioneer, The new .on() method supports delegated events as well. Read up on it at http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[12:22:42] <igcewieling> I've found form validators and other form related plugins.  Are there any plugins which help with the issue of "if field Z is "no", then disable fields A, B, and C?"
[12:23:21] <igcewieling> Right now I do all that manually in JS/jQuery and it has gotten fairly complicated.
[12:26:31] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/Qtb75/ so if a user selects multiple files, how can i make it append each file name instead of the last one chosen?
[12:26:45] <someprimetime> do i have to push each one to an array and then display that?
[12:30:20] <monk12> hmmm so i see the html selector spec seems to say brackets in the input id (and name) are invalid... java's spring framework seems to need these names like name="answers[questionID].property" to bind to the backend ... I think I saw jquery can still handle them, but escaping with \\[questionID\\] didn't work. Anyone know how to escape brackets within brackets like so: $('input[name="answers[QI3].rawAnswer"]')
[12:31:32] <monk12> nevermind got it :).
[12:33:35] <jmar777> any fans of jade (template engine) in here?
[12:34:48] <TheLolrus> Hi I have a problem when I try to get an offset.top() of a certain element. I'm trying to implement a vertical scrolling website. For some reason I get the error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of null" HTML: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/552735/ JS: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/552736/
[12:34:56] <_Brun0_> I have a menu which loads content using $.ajax() when user clicks an item. How can I cancel a previous ajax call when I want to submit a new one? For instance, the user clicks Item1 (starts loading Content1). Then when user clicks item2, it should stop loading Content1 and start loading Content2.
[12:36:52] <jmar777> _Brun0_: var jqXhr = $.ajax({...});  jqXhr.abort();
[12:39:19] <_Brun0_> jmar777, thnx
[12:39:42] <ag4ve> with .ajax, can i pass json and get back html?
[12:40:57] <LittleFoot> yes
[12:41:24] <LittleFoot> data: ({name:"lol"})
[12:41:27] <ag4ve> well, data is what i'm expecting, what specifies what goes in the request?
[12:41:36] <ag4ve> err, dataType
[12:41:52] <LittleFoot> datatype is response
[12:41:56] <LittleFoot> set to html
[12:42:04] <ag4ve> so, it's /expecting/ json for data?
[12:42:14] <ag4ve> right, i got the datatype, just not the data...
[12:42:14] <LittleFoot> data takes either json
[12:42:18] <LittleFoot> or
[12:42:22] <LittleFoot> querystring
[12:42:28] <LittleFoot> &name=lol
[12:42:39] <TheLolrus> anybody know my problem? :/
[12:42:52] <LittleFoot> ur a lolrus
[12:42:59] <TheLolrus> :D
[12:43:02] <LittleFoot> prob #1
[12:43:15] <TheLolrus> nah, I'm "The" lolrus
[12:43:31] <jmar777> Quick shameless self promotion: just OS'd a jquery plugin for using the jade template engine. It's just a small wrapper that provides a friendlier API
[12:43:34] <LittleFoot> even worse
[12:43:37] <jmar777> located here if interested: https://github.com/jmar777/jquery.jade.js
[12:43:41] <ag4ve> LittleFoot: huh, ok... thanks
[12:44:11] <LittleFoot> its automatic to accept either object or string

[12:47:07] <TheLolrus> so no help then DX
[12:55:17] <JonathanCutrell> Hey everyone. :)
[12:55:23] <JonathanCutrell> Quick, hopefully common problem.
[12:57:27] <JonathanCutrell> http://jsbin.com/upozuz/edit#javascript,html
[12:57:46] <JonathanCutrell> I'm using Ariel Flesler's scrollTo and ben_alman 's bbq plugins.
[12:57:55] <JonathanCutrell> This structure seems like it should work, but it doesn't.
[12:58:15] <JonathanCutrell> It's "wonky" at bestâ¦ I'll push it up for a link.
[13:00:15] <JonathanCutrell> http://labs.jonathancutrell.com/p2/
[13:00:18] <JonathanCutrell> There we go.
[13:00:30] <JonathanCutrell> Far from "smooth", for sure.
[13:00:36] <JonathanCutrell> Is there a better way?
[13:00:59] <JonathanCutrell> (sorry for the unstyled nature of the slides, etc.)
[13:02:47] <unclemantis> anyone care to help me decipher this error? If I could understand it perhaps I would be able to fix it on my own better. https://gist.github.com/88d908e0cee57e169628
[13:02:49] <unclemantis> thank you
[13:07:39] <DerekPioneer> i cannot get an li that is originally hidden to respond to an on click(), i've read the delegation article and tried lots of different things. http://bit.ly/Akvdb7
[13:08:08] <DerekPioneer> it's in the Envelopes tab at the top
[13:08:11] <DerekPioneer> and then line 1577
[13:08:20] <DerekPioneer> $("#colorbar").on("click","li"
[13:12:30] <unclemantis> could really use some help on this error. I am stuck on this for days :( ^^^
[13:12:58] <ajpiano> unclemantis: it means something is expecting to find a function when it references an object
[13:13:02] <jancel> have you tried #colorbar>li as your selector?
[13:13:03] <ajpiano> but something has loaded improperly
[13:13:05] <jancel> DerekPioneer
[13:13:40] <DerekPioneer> jancel: trying
[13:13:57] <DerekPioneer> jancel: like $("#colorbar>li").on("click" ?
[13:14:16] <jancel> yeah, , function(){ // do something }
[13:14:53] <jancel> finishes the phrase (try to alert("something") or console.log it
[13:14:53] <unclemantis> ajpiano umm i just don't know what it could be
[13:15:36] <DerekPioneer> jancel: no good
[13:15:42] <DerekPioneer> no alert
[13:15:54] <ajpiano> unclemantis: probably some bootstrap file that has the word "scrollSpy" in it
[13:16:09] <DerekPioneer> $("#interface").on("click","li"       alerts()
[13:16:28] <DerekPioneer> wait
[13:16:33] <DerekPioneer> that only alerts on the first page
[13:16:38] <DerekPioneer> and then when i hide that pages contents
[13:16:49] <DerekPioneer> the $("#interface").on("click","li"     stops working for #colorbar
[13:16:56] <DerekPioneer> even though #colorbar is contained by #interface
[13:19:13] <ajpiano> unclemantis: are you loading the bootstrap scrollspy plugin
[13:19:48] <DerekPioneer> <div id="interface"><div id="colorbar" style="display:hidden;"><li>hey</li></div></div>
[13:19:54] <DerekPioneer> the page loads and colorbar is hidden
[13:19:58] <phil-adept> afternoon all
[13:20:04] <phil-adept> evening even
[13:20:09] <DerekPioneer> but another list is showing inside #interface
[13:20:15] * phil-adept has drunk too much beer
[13:20:19] <DerekPioneer> $("irc://irc.freenode.net/#interface").on("click","li"    works for that other list
[13:20:34] <DerekPioneer> but when i unhide #colorbar, it doesn't work for it
[13:21:02] <jancel> can you reproduce in fiddler DerekPioneer
[13:21:13] <jancel> i mean jsfiddle
[13:21:14] <DerekPioneer> probably not, but i'll try
[13:21:51] <phil-adept> Who knows the asnswer to this... On doc.ready I want to iterate through each <li> within a <ul> and assign a data-id for each <li> coresponding to it's position in the <ul>
[13:22:01] <phil-adept> at the moment I am using the foloowing code
[13:25:57] <phil-adept> pastie.org/3404097
[13:31:20] <phil-adept> noone?
[13:31:26] <phil-adept> no-one even...
[13:31:30] * phil-adept needs coffee to sober up
[13:31:40] * phil-adept shouldn't have had 4 pints after work...
[13:32:40] <gehsekky> phil-adept: do you want to store the data in the li or the a?
[13:32:55] <DerekPioneer> why would $("#interface").on("click",'li',function(event)       not activate for an li
[13:33:06] <DerekPioneer> the ul is hidden when the page first loads
[13:33:13] <DerekPioneer> then the user clicks on a link and the ul is shown
[13:33:19] <DerekPioneer> #interface contains everything in the whole page
[13:33:40] <DerekPioneer> $("#interface").on("click",'li',function(event)       works for all the li's that load originally
[13:35:36] <gehsekky> DerekPioneer: $(document).on('click', '#interface li', function (e) {});  maybe?
[13:36:11] <phil-adept> gehsekky: within the li pleeeze :)
[13:36:37] <gehsekky> phil-adept: why are you looping through the a tags then?
[13:36:55] <phil-adept> gehsekky: Well...
[13:37:07] <DerekPioneer> gehsekky: no good
[13:37:15] <DerekPioneer> when the page first loads the li is hidden
[13:37:26] <DerekPioneer> but when another li is clicked it still activates
[13:38:08] <phil-adept> gehsekky: I want to assign the attribute in the front end not the back end. I know I can do it by using var = $('').length and then a for ( $x= etc etc ) but I wanted to know if theres a way in jQuery to get the index of an element within its parent
[13:38:14] <toddWork> i'm building a static website.
[13:38:31] <toddWork> is there a downside to using .load() to load headers and footers etc?
[13:38:51] <toddWork> i'm thinking to use it instead of php includes.
[13:38:53] <gehsekky> phil-adept: .index()?
[13:39:08] <NoiseEee> toddWork: why oh why?!
[13:39:20] <toddWork> NoiseEee: thats why i'm asking.
[13:39:25] <phil-adept> toddWork: header and footer is daft to render client side
[13:39:30] <NoiseEee> toddWork: so now your viewer needs to make 3 requests to render your webpage?
[13:39:44] <toddWork> good point.
[13:39:44] <phil-adept> gehsekky: coz I couldn't think of the function!
[13:39:47] <phil-adept> gehsekky: lol
[13:40:21] <phil-adept> gehsekky: .index() in the current element in the .eac() iteration?
[13:40:26] <toddWork> thanks
[13:40:37] <phil-adept> gehsekky: $(this).index()?..
[13:41:45] <gehsekky> phil-adept: http://pastie.org/3404197
[13:44:57] <phil-adept> gehsekky:  $(this).data('id', $('#web-usage-menu li').index(this)) need to be  $(this).data('id', $('#web-usage-menu li a').index(this)) but thatnks!!!!
[13:45:17] <z0ned> if i have an object[] b inside of object[]a, and i extend a with c, will c inherit b and all it's objects?
[13:46:17] <phil-adept> gehsekky:  why can't I sue this?....
[13:46:33] <phil-adept>  $(this).data('id', $(this).index(this))
[13:46:41] <phil-adept> gehsekky:  why can't I use* this?....
[13:46:43] <phil-adept>  $(this).data('id', $(this).index(this))
[13:47:03] <gehsekky> read up on how .index() works
[13:47:21] <phil-adept> gehsekky: Wow...
[13:47:53] <LittleFoot> hey guys
[13:48:09] <gehsekky> the selector should be an array of items. what you pass into .index() is the object/value you're looking for
[13:48:09] <LittleFoot> ajax wont work w cron rite?
[13:49:40] <phil-adept> gehsekky:  Right... ASIU ...Through each iteration of the .each(), you reference the 'current' element as $(this) correct?
[13:49:43] <toddWork> LittleFoot: i don't know; but i'm curious about what you are trying to do. fire a cron via a php line w/ ajax?
[13:49:44] <phil-adept> AFAIU*
[13:49:55] <gehsekky> phil-adept: yep
[13:50:17] <LittleFoot> toddWork yeah
[13:50:33] <phil-adept> gehsekky:  Right... so whilst iterating through an aray of elements (in this case $('#web-usage-menu li') )
[13:50:51] <phil-adept> each element is referenced as $(this)
[13:50:52] <LittleFoot> run cron which fill run the php script taht will run the ajax
[13:51:01] <LittleFoot> loop
[13:51:33] <toddWork> i still don't know but i don't know why it wouldn't work; cron is just running files.
[13:51:45] <toddWork> scripts, i mean.
[13:51:51] <phil-adept> gehsekky:  in your example you said to use $(this).data('id', $('#web-usage-menu li').index(this)) and I'm asking why I can't use $(this) in place of $('#web-usage-menu li')?
[13:52:25] <phil-adept> Maybe I don't get some fundamental internal working / understanding of jQuery?
[13:52:27] <gehsekky> because $(this) is referring to the specific 'li' in the iteration
[13:52:37] <toddWork> my guess is that if you can run the php script from the CLI and it works, then CRON would be doing essentially the same thing.
[13:52:57] <gehsekky> what i think you want is the index position of the current 'li' in the parent 'ul', no?
[13:53:08] <phil-adept> Correct, so why can't I get (my position within my parent whilst iterating in this each().)
[13:53:18] <LittleFoot> toddWork: i think it may have issues with paths
[13:53:41] <phil-adept> sorry if my terminoligy is wrong... I have issues articulating myself :D
[13:53:41] <toddWork> ok. sorry.
[13:53:42] <gehsekky> iterator patterns don't require indexes/counters
[13:54:04] <phil-adept> they may not require them, however what if I want to reference them?
[13:54:13] <babonk> Is it possible for the value of $(this) to change as you progress through a function?
[13:54:42] <phil-adept> Maybe I dont want to use a for( etc ) statement with a .length() var..
[13:54:49] <DerekPioneer> why would hiding a div and then showing it again stop all its on clicks from working
[13:56:30] <phil-adept> Am I making sense? I dunno, I think my inetntions aren't coming across
[13:57:39] <gehsekky> phil-adept: so are you trying to get the index position of an <a> tag inside an <li>? or the index position of an <li> inside its parent <ul>?
[13:57:51] <phil-adept> gehsekky: the later
[13:58:05] <z0ned> can someone tell me why this doesn't work the way i think it should? http://jsfiddle.net/a4mke/2/
[13:58:08] <phil-adept> 1 sec, I'll do a jfiddle
[13:58:51] <toddWork> phil-adept: $('ul#foo').each(function(index, element) {alert(index)} <--?
[13:59:13] <ajpiano> phil-adept: $(anything).index()
[13:59:16] <ajpiano> with no arguments
[13:59:23] <ajpiano> by default gives you the position of the element among its siblings
[13:59:50] <someprimetime> if you go to: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/Qcv3p/1/ and add multiple files, you'll see in the console log an object called: [jQuery.fn.jQuery.init[1]] is written
[14:00:00] <jtreminio> Hello - is there a way to set jquery to detect a change() on multiple fields? Instead of having to do a $('#foo').change(function(){}); for each element, I'd want to do a if (foo1 || foo2 || foo3).change() type of thing?
[14:00:06] <someprimetime> if i upload 2 files, it has 2 properties called files with those file names
[14:00:16] <someprimetime> how can I retrieve those files?
[14:00:27] <toddWork> jtreminio: can you add the same class to each of those fields?
[14:00:28] <someprimetime> err the file names*
[14:00:34] <z0ned> jtreminio, give all the elements a class
[14:00:46] <jtreminio> toddparker, that's genius :\ how did that escape my thoughts haha
[14:00:53] <jtreminio> thanks z0ned too
[14:01:03] <toddWork> $().index escaped mine, as well. heh.
[14:01:11] <jtreminio> I'm over here trying to create some absurdly complicated thing and I completely forgot about that
[14:01:17] <z0ned> lol
[14:01:35] <Whirl3d> jtreminio, are you using 1.7?
[14:01:53] <jtreminio> I think it's 1.6.x
[14:01:57] <phil-adept> http://jsfiddle.net/fNPv4/
[14:02:11] <ajpiano> jtreminio: $("#foo,#bar,#baz").change(fn) works as well
[14:02:54] <jtreminio> huh, that's actually what I originally wanted. although the class identifier works well too
[14:02:59] <jtreminio> thanks ajpiano
[14:05:25] <gehsekky> phil-adept: http://jsfiddle.net/fNPv4/3/   is this what you want?
[14:05:43] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/Qcv3p/1/ how can i access the files portion of that object when you add multiple files?
[14:06:13] <toddWork> back to .load() for headers etc: so it's better to replace the $('#content') w/ $.load() then doing headers, footers etc. correct?
[14:06:38] <mightym> hey guys I'm new to js/jquery and like to scroll my page while my cursor is in on a element â¦ what i did so far is this http://pastie.org/3404335 â¦ the problem is that for hover this only works 1 time â¦ and if i use instead of "+=200"  f.e. "9000" it isn't a nice animation if the stop is called. maybe someone has a hint for me how to solve that in a better way
[14:08:27] <phil-adept> gehsekky: yes, but instead of "yay" the current index() in the parent()
[14:08:37] <gehsekky> oh, i thought i changed that
[14:08:46] <gehsekky> it should be what ajpiano said. $(this).index()
[14:08:52] <phil-adept> I thought this would work....
[14:08:53] <phil-adept> $(this).data( 'id', $(this).parent().index( $(this) ) );
[14:09:04] <phil-adept> ah ok
[14:15:03] <phil-adept> Nope it doest work
[14:16:32] <phil-adept> ok let me put it simpler...
[14:16:41] <KWhat_Work> Anyone know how to use .ajax?
[14:17:02] <KWhat_Work> i dont seem to understand how to get a result back
[14:17:03] <toddWork> kind of.
[14:17:29] <toddWork> KWhat_Work: paste your code in paste bin or similar.
[14:17:32] <someprimetime> no, no one in here knows how to use it
[14:17:39] <gehsekky> ajax scares me
[14:17:41] <someprimetime> we all just started with jquery today
[14:17:44] <gehsekky> async nooooooooo
[14:18:01] <someprimetime> jk post your code up bro and maybe we can help

[14:19:27] <phil-adept> KWhat_Work you use data.WHATEVER
[14:19:47] <Flesoft> as I canÂ return aÂ variable from aÂ popup?
[14:19:49] <KWhat_Work> phil-adept: what about for error
[14:19:53] <phil-adept> if you're returning JSON then you use the key etc dat.KEY
[14:20:04] <phil-adept> depends on what you're returning!!!
[14:20:30] <Flesoft> help: as I canÂ return aÂ variable from aÂ popup?
[14:20:39] <phil-adept> if you want it to run a function on error then use error:
[14:21:10] <KWhat_Work> i am returning {'name': 'error'}
[14:21:17] <KWhat_Work> to the error function

[14:22:59] <phil-adept> KWhat_Work: I think your mistaken. if your back-end returns an error, your ajax call will still return a positive result :)
[14:23:35] <KWhat_Work> phil-adept: im setting my return status to 400
[14:23:41] <z1000> if I have <li class="active"><a href="">some text</a>             how do I get the text val        $('li.active a').val(); ?
[14:23:52] <KWhat_Work> so its causing an error, i just have no idea if its even possible to get teh data that comes back with that error
[14:24:04] <phil-adept> KWhat_Work: if you return{'name': 'error'} it will still run whatever function you have assigned to success: as it will be a complete ajax call
[14:24:09] <Flesoft> window.opener.document
[14:24:21] <phil-adept> KWhat_Work:  sec....

[14:26:07] <phil-adept> KWhat_Work: maybe i missunderstand...
[14:26:09] <Whirl3d> z1000, use .text()
[14:26:13] <phil-adept> KWhat_Work: please explain
[14:26:28] <KWhat_Work> so it is not possible to get that information from the error function...
[14:26:46] <KWhat_Work> if i set the status code for 400 to trigger an ajax error I cannot read the response
[14:27:11] <phil-adept> the error fucntion will only trigger if there is an error within making the ajax call, not when there are errors reported within the return of a completed call
[14:27:36] <KWhat_Work> phil-adept: if you set the http response code to 400 that is an error making the ajax call
[14:28:19] <phil-adept> and ASAIU your ajax call is being COMLETED... your returning an error through a COMPOLETED ajax call
[14:28:25] <phil-adept> thery're different things
[14:28:32] <phil-adept> AFAIU*
[14:29:30] <Flesoft>  as I canÂ return aÂ variable from aÂ popup?
[14:29:52] <phil-adept> Flesoft: depends on the popupo
[14:30:57] <someprimetime> how can i return the file names when using a input file type button of multiple files?
[14:31:09] <someprimetime> what i have is not working

[14:32:21] <phil-adept> KWhat_Work: Does that make sense?
[14:33:01] <phil-adept> Flesoft: how is the var represented? a txt field?
[14:33:03] <ndss56> http://jsfiddle.net/E6UZq/16/ <-- how to get all options in a select into an jquery array?
[14:33:33] <KWhat_Work> yah, its more like ext and less like prototype
[14:33:34] <Whirl3d> $("select").find("option");
[14:34:23] <phil-adept> KWhat_Work: it's more like jQuery ;)
[14:34:28] <KWhat_Work> phil-adept: i take it the data var has already been evaluated
[14:34:46] <gehsekky> Whirl3d: is .find() faster than $('select option')?
[14:34:58] <phil-adept> the data var is your return from a successful ajax call
[14:35:03] <Flesoft> phil-adept: when you clickÂ a linkÂ back to theÂ mainÂ we postedÂ an id
[14:35:18] <phil-adept> if in the backend you have a php file that echos "hello" then data = "hello"
[14:36:02] <phil-adept> if in the backend you have a php file that outputs JSON, then you end up with { myVar:hello } and data.myVar = hello
[14:36:36] <phil-adept> gehsekky: I'd say so but I can't be sure
[14:37:08] <phil-adept> gehsekky: I thought it's faster to find an element then its attr's rather than aything elkse
[14:40:20] <chovy> how should I define a function inside my jQuery plugin. I don't want it to collide with something outside the scope of the plugin.

[14:43:19] <z0ned> i have a click handler attached to a button on my page. i need to wait for my click handler function to finish before the button's default action is processed. is there a way i can do something like..... e.preventDefault(); //do some stuff e.activeDefault();
[14:43:34] <chovy> well, according to this page, it looks like the methods should be defined outside of the plugin
[14:43:40] <chovy> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Plugin_Methods
[14:43:46] <chovy> that makes no sense to me.
[14:44:29] <ag4ve> can someone tell me why i can't see the element data? ie, what i type in the box in the console log?
[14:44:39] <ag4ve> oops http://paste.scsys.co.uk/182639
[14:46:32] <toddWork> ag4ve: is this a dom ready situation? your div isn't there yet to be found, maybe?
[14:46:33] <chovy> ag4ve: $input.val()
[14:46:57] <KWhat_Work> does jquery have a way to convert string to json or should i just use eval ?
[14:47:21] <bot-t> KWhat_Work, jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[14:47:24] <chovy> KWhat_Work: you should use JSON.js
[14:47:45] <chovy> well if you want to go both directions.
[14:47:46] <toddWork> ag4ve: oh sorry; i see it.
[14:48:35] <ag4ve> val gives me function() but not what i'm typing in the input...?
[14:48:51] <phil-adept> I have NEVER found a reason to use eval... I've always been told it's the devil
[14:48:59] <z0ned> KWhat_Work, please don't EVER use eval.
[14:49:07] <chovy> ag4ve: val()
[14:50:07] <ag4ve> ooooooh, i can read the docs, but i just can't follow directions.
[14:50:20] <phil-adept> z0ned: store the action you wish to ruhn BEFORE preventing the default, then recalling it if the outcome is correct
[14:50:25] <ag4ve> so, why are the () required?
[14:50:30] <KWhat_Work> ugh now i am getting a jqXHR not defined error
[14:50:51] <KWhat_Work> oh never mind
[14:51:05] <z0ned> phil-adept, how do i "store the action" ?
[14:51:56] <chovy> ag4ve: because it's a function. you have to execute it.
[14:52:27] <standoo> is there a centralized place to share jquery code snippets?
[14:52:32] <chovy> ag4ve: i think you're confusing native js properties with jQuery functions.
[14:52:44] <z0ned> phil-adept, if i want the default action to run at the end regardless, is this even a problem for me? does the default action and my click function run asynchronously?
[14:52:51] <chovy> ag4ve: but really, in your case, you could just do this.value
[14:53:10] <chovy> ag4ve: $input is a jquery object, so you need to do $obj.val()
[14:53:17] <phil-adept> ag4ve: http://jsfiddle.net/7NFjt/
[14:53:54] <chovy> z0ned: i believe the default runs after your code.
[14:54:09] <chovy> but i'm not sure.
[14:54:13] <ag4ve> ah, yeah, it would be a function and class functions i guess
[14:54:20] <phil-adept> z0ned: if you want it to run regardless, why prevent it?
[14:54:59] <ag4ve> s/and/and not/
[14:55:11] <z0ned> phil-adept, because i wasn't sure if there would be a race condition between the default and my function... i want default to run regardless, but it needs to run AFTER my function
[14:56:01] <z0ned> anyone know?
[14:57:52] <chovy> z0ned: i would assume it goes after, since returning false would prevent it.
[14:58:18] <z0ned> chovy...makes sense
[14:59:38] <phil-adept> a race condition?
[15:00:14] <phil-adept> ag gethca...
[15:06:14] <tieTYT> how can I make a submit button be disabled after being clicked AND still submit the form?  I figured out the former
[15:08:28] <chovy> any plugin authors out there want to review my code?
[15:08:51] <gehsekky> what does the plugin do?
[15:09:02] <chovy> it handles tabbed navigation
[15:09:10] <chovy> http://chovy.dyndns.org/jquery/tabbed-navigation/
[15:09:24] <chovy> Here's the plugin: http://chovy.dyndns.org/jquery/tabbed-navigation/jquery.tabbed.js
[15:14:04] <KWhat_Work> i keep doing a self._trigger('failure', ['test']); and i cant figure out how to get the test arg
[15:15:00] <z0ned> is there a jquery function to encode json?
[15:15:34] <chovy> KWhat_Work: do you have it named?
[15:15:47] <KWhat_Work> named?
[15:17:44] <chovy> KWhat_Work: inside function _trigger(foo, bar)
[15:17:57] <chovy> you can get bar as an array.
[15:18:28] <KWhat_Work> im guessing its being pulled form the widget because i didnt define trigger
[15:19:14] <sroy2> Hi, does anyone see where I'm going wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/PSWyt/ -> I'm trying to pull data out of a json file and build a list with it.
[15:20:21] <KWhat_Work> probably cross domain request
[15:21:48] <sroy2> errâ¦ hmm
[15:22:23] <KWhat_Work> WTF is a typer formfailure
[15:22:35] <KWhat_Work> where the fuck is it comming from
[15:23:31] <sroy2> the issue I'm having with it though is that the <ul></ul> is getting put in before the rest of the list. I can't figure out a way to have it put them around the $.each()
[15:23:45] <tw2113> sroy2 you're getting an empty response
[15:24:20] <sroy2> tw2113:  here, this will show the code actually somewhat working: http://confession.th3dojo.net/dev/
[15:24:29] <tw2113> i'm console logging your data var right inside the getJSON
[15:24:57] <KWhat_Work> sroy2: http://jsfiddle.net/PSWyt/2/
[15:25:25] <bed777> hig uys
[15:25:31] <KWhat_Work> sroy2: well fix this disaster as well varÂ nav_divÂ =Â "<li>"+data.header+"</li>";
[15:25:42] <bed777> I would want that when I click on div#one the event 'click' is transferred on another div
[15:26:23] <KWhat_Work> sroy2: http://jsfiddle.net/PSWyt/3/
[15:26:44] <sroy2> oh, didn't know you could do that...
[15:27:01] <KWhat_Work> ;)
[15:27:10] <bed777> I want, when i click on div#one â $("div#two").click(function(){ console.log('You have clicked on div#one'); });
[15:27:17] <bed777> the event on div#two is fired
[15:27:55] <chovy> anyone look at my plugin?
[15:28:15] <jancel> put that function elsewhere, on its own perhaps, and just cal it when div#one is called.
[15:28:24] <jancel> or fired, or whenever you want to.
[15:29:10] <bed777> only that method jancel?
[15:29:21] <jancel> so... $("div#one").click(function(){$("div#two").html("Hello")})
[15:29:41] <StevenCodes22> sup
[15:30:06] <bed777> y..
[15:31:38] <jancel> http://jsfiddle.net/THPf6/ bed777
[15:32:45] <sroy2> KWhat_Work:  if I want to nest <a href=#> inside the <li/> how do you do that? I tried just putting <a href=#/> after it but that puts it outside the <li></li>
[15:33:33] <jancel> good night all. have a fine weekend.
[15:34:07] <ndss56> what does e.preventDefault();
[15:34:07] <ndss56>   do?
[15:34:45] <Whirl3d> gnite jancel
[15:35:01] <kara_sweets> ndss56, usually used to prevent the default html action to occur so that jquery runs instead, pretty common with ajax or post
[15:35:19] <kara_sweets> can anybody help combine these actions into one ? https://gist.github.com/1856190
[15:35:57] <KWhat_Work> sroy2: you can do something like list.append($('<a/>').attr('href', '#'))
[15:39:03] <sroy2> KWhat_Work:  I don't see how that puts that inside the <li/> tags though? hmm is there a good tutorial somewhere that I could learn about thisâ¦ as you can tell from my "code"+var+"code" approach, I am not very familiar with this.
[15:39:14] <bed777> and
[15:39:18] <KWhat_Work> send me the link to the jsfiddle again
[15:39:20] <bed777> How can I fire this event event      : 'click.editable' ?
[15:39:23] <bed777> click.editable
[15:39:29] <bed777> when I click on a div, for example
[15:40:12] <KWhat_Work> ndss56: prevents the event (e) from propagating to its default destination
[15:40:20] <sroy2> KWhat_Work:  http://jsfiddle.net/PSWyt/3/ that was yours, I basically want to put a <li><a href=#>data.header</a></li> where I was putting <li/> before.
[15:41:02] <ndss56> KWhat_Work: so basically you must always use it if your running javascripts?
[15:41:53] <nFFF> No, you use it when you don't when the default event to occur
[15:41:59] <nFFF> :>
[15:42:00] <KWhat_Work> no
[15:42:09] <KWhat_Work> ^^
[15:42:11] <tieTYT> can anyone tell me why this jquery is changing the way my form submits? http://jsfiddle.net/nY5ep/
[15:42:18] <ch3mical> ?trigger @ bed777
[15:42:19] <bot-t> bed777, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[15:42:25] <bed777> yt
[15:42:28] <bed777> ty
[15:43:06] <shoelessone> Hey all! I know this is a long shot, but does anybdoy have any idea how you might have a webpage layover BEFORE anything else is shown?
[15:43:20] <shoelessone> Basically a lightbox/shadowbox/whatever, but that isthe first thing that shows up on page load?
[15:43:50] <ndss56> so like clicking on a link will not actually goto the linked site if u do e.preventDefault() for example
[15:44:52] <nFFF> tieTYT, theres no html :>
[15:45:12] <nFFF> and 'way form submits' is quite ambigious
[15:45:44] <tieTYT> ok http://jsfiddle.net/nY5ep/1/
[15:46:24] <tieTYT> now after submitting it goes from http://localhost:8080/DeployManager/confirm.do back to http://localhost:8080/DeployManager/confirm.do.  Normally it redirects to another page on the backend
[15:48:01] <nFFF> First thing I guess is, why .prop? isn't disabled an attribute?
[15:48:15] <tieTYT> i'll see if that changes things
[15:48:18] <tieTYT> but that detail seems to work
[15:48:22] <tieTYT> it disables correctly
[15:48:26] <ch3mical> nFFF, Because it doesn't work on attributes, it works on properties
[15:48:32] <ch3mical> ?attr @ nFFF
[15:48:32] <bot-t> nFFF, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[15:48:55] <nFFF> I guess you can do both
[15:49:06] <tieTYT> i've read that you can do both, yeah
[15:49:08] <skyl> with getJSON, I need to setRequestHeader; is this possible?
[15:49:12] <nFFF> disabled="disabled" also works as an attribute
[15:49:19] <mightym> hey guys, is there a event when scrolling of a browser ends?
[15:49:37] <ndss56> http://jsfiddle.net/E6UZq/19/ <-- does not return when input field is empty
[15:49:44] <ndss56> can someone take a quick look
[15:50:01] <nFFF> tieTYT, as to your question, there is nothing in your code that should effect the submit, perhaps its your local enivornment?
[15:50:13] <ndss56> else if (newVal.length == 0)
[15:50:13] <ndss56>                 return;
[15:50:16] <KWhat_Work> mightym: i dont think so, but you can get a scroll event and use a timer
[15:50:28] <skyl> I guess I just use jsonp with .ajax .. hopefully
[15:50:32] <tieTYT> nFFF: when i comment out that js, it works as expected
[15:51:17] <nFFF> Whats the default behavious?
[15:51:23] <nFFF> behavior* you expect?
[15:51:58] <nFFF> That code will literally submit your form
[15:52:42] <mightym> KWhat_Work: hmm, my problem is that i have to reposition an element f.e. in safari when the momentum scroll ends
[15:52:47] <tieTYT> i'm talking about the behavior on the backend
[15:52:50] <chovy> skyl: the server should serve your json file with the correct header.
[15:52:52] <tieTYT> somehow it's sending different request params or something
[15:53:25] <skyl> chovy request header
[15:54:47] <nFFF> tieTYT, can you explain more? Perhaps you need to serialize your form first?
[15:55:16] <sroy2> KWhat_Work:  http://jsfiddle.net/PSWyt/5/  any advice on how to put the links inside the list elements?
[15:56:03] <KWhat_Work> sroy2: http://jsfiddle.net/PSWyt/6/
[15:56:31] <KWhat_Work> you could probasbly clean that up a little more but i can never remember what .append returns
[15:56:53] <KWhat_Work> mightym: just set the timeout really low
[15:57:12] <sroy2> KWhat_Work:  thanks :)
[15:57:17] <KWhat_Work> mightym: you need to know when it stops scrolling or when it gest to the bottom
[16:00:30] <nFFF> ndss56
[16:00:31] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/E6UZq/20/
[16:01:29] <ndss56> nFFF: doesn't work. tested on IE8
[16:02:02] <chovy> skyl: response header. application/json
[16:03:10] <nFFF> ndss56, if the value is null you want the select to dissapear or the focus?
[16:03:39] <ndss56> nFFF: want the input to dissapear
[16:03:57] <ndss56> nFFF: input is 0/null
[16:04:02] <StevenCodes22>   /join #hl2
[16:04:46] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/E6UZq/21/
[16:05:52] <skyl> chovy the answer to my question appears to be no
[16:05:54] <nFFF> You can check against newVal too, it doesn't make any difference
[16:06:02] <skyl> you can't set request headers on a jsonp request
[16:07:15] <ndss56> nFFF: it works but makes the bottom jQuery(this).remove();
[16:07:15] <ndss56>  redundant
[16:07:28] <chovy> skyl: you're server needs to put application/json in the response headers, then you don't have to worry about it. $.getJSON() will work fine.
[16:07:32] <nFFF> Yes the way you've coded this is just wierd :<
[16:08:10] <skyl> chovy, the server does different things based on accept-language
[16:08:45] <ndss56> nFFF: sorry, my code is weird :(
[16:09:18] <nFFF> But at least it works
[16:09:28] <nFFF> Who cares if the bottom one is redundant :P
[16:09:28] <chovy> skyl: i believe you can override mime-type
[16:09:33] <chovy> but that's all i know of.
[16:09:38] <jaequery> do people still wrap javascript codes around //<![CDATA[  ?
[16:09:40] <ndss56> nFFF: another issue with the code is that when input is 0/null and you try to click '+ Add New' it won't work because there was no .change event
[16:10:23] <ndss56> nFFF: any ideas how to correct this?
[16:10:48] <chovy> jaequery: nah
[16:11:06] <chovy> i dn't even use attributes anymore
[16:11:10] <chovy> just <script>
[16:11:23] <ndss56> nFFF: can you somehow get it to show the list with the first option selected?
[16:14:06] <jaequery> why do others do it?
[16:14:35] <mightym> KWhat_Work: thx a lot!
[16:14:44] <KWhat_Work> np
[16:18:00] <nFFF> ndss56
[16:18:01] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/E6UZq/23/
[16:19:10] <ndss56> nFFF: brilliant. cheers
[16:19:31] <nFFF> ndss56 actually Id probably do this: http://jsfiddle.net/E6UZq/24/
[16:19:49] <nFFF> just incase your don't know if the first value will defiantely be '0'
[16:20:06] <nFFF> Id also make the selector more specific incase of a large codebase
[16:20:36] <ndss56> nFFF: yes you are right on both accounts :)
[16:32:23] <sroy2> so this is doing exactly what I want it to be doing: http://jsfiddle.net/PSWyt/8/    does anyone see any ways that I should change the code to improve it? (I'm not very experienced w/ js or jqery and would appreciate any feedback)
[16:35:39] <bonhoeffer> any idea how to append a div below a select query from an on-change
[16:35:53] <bonhoeffer> i try $(this).parent.append('foo') <-- doesn't work
[16:36:02] <nFFF> parent()
[16:36:09] <bonhoeffer> oh, .. .
[16:36:40] <bonhoeffer> nFFF:
[16:36:42] <bonhoeffer> works
[16:36:47] <nFFF> :>
[16:37:40] <donCams> :3
[16:42:56] <aghouseh> looking for some style advice..
[16:43:18] <aghouseh> ive got a function that checks a select to show/hide content, but it feels sloppy.. i just dont know the 'right' or best method to do it
[16:43:21] <aghouseh> http://pastie.org/3405090
[16:43:30] <aghouseh> it works fine, it just seems clunky
[16:44:18] <aghouseh> more talking in terms of calling the function onload and also on change of the actual select
[16:44:33] <bonhoeffer> harder -- if i append a div, then i want to change again . . . don't want to append _another_ div
[16:44:44] <ohcibi> aghouseh: first checkType should not 'set' the type...
[16:44:56] <bonhoeffer> the appending is working fine now .. . just getting a long list of things when i only want one
[16:45:09] <ohcibi> aghouseh: second: use checkType as mentioned in first only to check the type.. .and then use jQuery.toggle() to toggle the visibility
[16:45:35] <ohcibi> aghouseh: never do something in a method which the name does not imply
[16:45:36] <aghouseh> i see
[16:45:42] <aghouseh> that makes sense
[16:45:54] <nFFF> bonhoeffer, replaceWith
[16:46:12] <aghouseh> also it seems archaic in terms of structure
[16:46:39] <ohcibi> aghouseh: it does 8-))....
[16:46:43] <ohcibi> ?toggle
[16:46:44] <bot-t> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[16:46:46] <bonhoeffer> nFFF: i'll look into it -- thanks -- any tips appreciated
[16:46:57] <nFFF> ?replacewith
[16:46:57] <bot-t> .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[16:47:14] <aghouseh> yeah toggle is fine, but i guess its the running the function then checking it again on change that i dont like
[16:47:43] <bonhoeffer> nFFF: yes, but how do i test to see if i've appended and need to do a replacewith
[16:48:01] <ohcibi> aghouseh: you mean to set it initially?
[16:48:21] <nFFF> bonhoeffer, just give the div a class
[16:48:34] <bonhoeffer> yes -- got it
[16:48:38] <aghouseh> ohcibi: yeah.
[16:48:40] <nFFF> And then $('.class').replaceWith()
[16:48:48] <nFFF> if the class doesn't exist it wont replace
[16:49:03] <aghouseh> ohcibi: i know enough to see that its not elegant, but i dont know enough to do it elegantly :)
[16:49:24] <ohcibi> aghouseh: yeah but first get that checkType-thing in order 8-))
[16:49:36] <ohcibi> aghouseh: and then as a first guess i'd set it initially with the application
[16:49:44] <aghouseh> k
[16:49:51] <nFFF> /regular/gi what does this match? out of curioisty
[16:49:59] <ohcibi> aghouseh: so when generating the html initially with php or rails or whatever, set the class properly.. and then only care about the change
[16:50:21] <ohcibi> aghouseh: s/set the class/set the visibility/
[16:50:22] <aghouseh> yeah got it
[16:50:24] <ohcibi> k
[16:50:25] <ohcibi> 8-))
[16:52:30] <aghouseh> toggle doesnt make sense to me though
[16:52:37] <aghouseh> the toggle function does.. but in this instance it does not
[16:52:49] <aghouseh> http://pastie.org/3405090
[16:53:01] <aghouseh> or am i missing something
[16:53:52] <ohcibi> aghouseh: the bot posted the wrong toggle(): http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[16:54:21] <nFFF> ?toggle()
[16:54:21] <bot-t> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[16:54:28] <ohcibi> aghouseh: hm its the same link.. anyway.. search toggle on jquery, i mean the second on in the list
[16:54:28] <aghouseh> right, im familiar with toggle.. but it seems like it would be a button / checkbox thing instead of a select
[16:54:33] <aghouseh> sec.
[16:54:37] <nFFF> ?toggle(showorhide)
[16:54:37] <bot-t> .toggle(showOrHide): Display or hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/#toggle2
[16:54:43] <ohcibi> nFFF: thx
[16:54:44] <ohcibi> 8-))
[16:54:47] <aghouseh> same link but it should have updated.
[16:55:00] <nFFF> clever bot :D
[16:55:06] <aghouseh> yea but i guess my point is that the select can change.. but still not be the 'right' answer
[16:55:40] <aghouseh> http://pastie.org/pastes/3405090/text
[16:55:41] <ohcibi> aghouseh: with toggle() there is no if
[16:55:46] <aghouseh> thats what i mean
[16:56:23] <ohcibi> aghouseh: if checkType returns true for show and false for hide you'd do element.toggle(checkType()); in change-callback
[16:57:09] <ohcibi> aghouseh: remember: checkType just 'checks' so its only a boolean returning if it should be shown or not
[16:57:21] <ohcibi> aghouseh: at least thats what the method-name implies 8-)
[16:57:41] <nFFF> Why dont I see any checkType in his code??? :<<
[16:57:49] <aghouseh> i removed it :p
[16:57:52] <aghouseh> consolidated
[16:57:52] <ohcibi> because i'm drunk ant wanted to explain much 8-))
[16:58:25] <ohcibi> nFFF: checkType is a legacy-method 8-))
[16:58:35] <ohcibi> its deprecated
[17:00:12] <nFFF> :D
[17:00:43] <aghouseh> so, that code looks pretty clean to me. thoughts nFFF ?
[17:00:56] <ohcibi> nFFF: its not DRY..
[17:01:12] <ohcibi> nFFF: reincarnate the checkType method and make it to return a boolean if it should be checked or not
[17:01:29] <bonhoeffer> i ended up with this mess: https://gist.github.com/1856643
[17:01:37] <ohcibi> aghouseh: then do $('element').change(function() { $('element_to_be_toggled').toggle(checkType()); });
[17:01:38] <hlve> sup guys
[17:01:39] <bonhoeffer> know there is a better way to do it
[17:02:07] <aghouseh> hm
[17:02:48] <nFFF> ?length()
[17:02:49] <bot-t> nFFF, .length - The number of elements in the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/length/
[17:02:57] <nFFF> remove the brackets
[17:03:49] <ohcibi> aghouseh: the point is: let jquery care about the visibility, and you care about the reason to make it visible or not
[17:03:57] <aghouseh> gotcha
[17:04:12] <aghouseh> except it doesnt work :p
[17:04:26] <aghouseh> oh sec
[17:04:27] <ohcibi> aghouseh: dont't mind if i'm repetitive, and just do the pasts its friday 8-))
[17:04:33] <ohcibi> *pastes
[17:04:39] <aghouseh> it just toggles no matter what
[17:04:42] <aghouseh> on every change
[17:05:10] <bonhoeffer> nFFF: thanks!
[17:05:12] <ohcibi> aghouseh: i'll fiddle something
[17:05:17] <aghouseh> well
[17:05:27] <aghouseh> its actually .. the arg is diff now or something
[17:05:34] <aghouseh> the first arg of toggle is the speed
[17:05:56] <aghouseh> so when it 'matches' it animates it
[17:06:03] <aghouseh> and when it doesnt, it just hides/shows
[17:06:40] <aghouseh> ah HA
[17:06:42] <aghouseh> i gotcha!
[17:06:47] <aghouseh> just had to return a Boolean()
[17:06:48] <ohcibi> aghouseh: if you only pass one arg and its  a boolean it behaves different
[17:06:52] <aghouseh> :D
[17:06:53] <ohcibi> aghouseh: ++
[17:06:55] <ohcibi> 8-))
[17:07:50] <aghouseh> awesome thanks for your help
[17:07:51] <someprimetime> say i have a form that allows multiple uploads, but a user can remove one and it won't get submitted, how do i remove that value from the .files object?
[17:07:58] <aghouseh> i can feel my mind expanding
[17:08:25] <ohcibi> wow that's nice... leaving the channel rightaway 8-)))
[17:10:15] <fof> used
[17:10:37] <bonhoeffer> this works now, but i think it is clumsy, i'm i missing some helpers: https://gist.github.com/1856643
[17:10:50] <bonhoeffer> i think i'm missing some helpers and would love to learn
[17:11:16] <bonhoeffer> in particular i think this one needs replaced: select_field.parent().append("<div id='e_" + s_id + "'></div>");
[17:12:11] <someprimetime> what exactly do you mean it's missing helpers?
[17:12:13] <someprimetime> what helpers?
[17:12:41] <nFFF> :>
[17:12:51] <nFFF> bonhoeffer, if the code works its fine
[17:12:59] <ohcibi> someprimetime: someone to carry the whisky-cask
[17:13:04] <bonhoeffer> nFFF: fair enough
[17:13:12] <ohcibi> nah
[17:13:13] <ohcibi> 8-))
[17:13:29] <someprimetime> ha not gonna happen
[17:13:55] <ohcibi> bonhoeffer: put html output into seperate method.. in fact i'd create jquery-object and manipulate their attributes with jquery-methods
[17:14:27] <ohcibi> bonhoeffer: instead of supplying raw html
[17:14:40] <wcchandler> I'm kind of new to javascript and jquery -- i wrote a php script that returns a 0 or 1 and I'm calling it in (the only thing I know of) jquery .get("php script")  but I just read that functions places it into an object.  What is the best way to go about doing this?  I just need a var that can possess 0 or 1
[17:14:46] <ohcibi> bonhoeffer: and i missed all the plurals in the sentence
[17:15:37] <ohcibi> wcchandler: the first a in ajax means asynchronous... you should read about this and callbacks and everything..
[17:15:39] <bonhoeffer> ohcibi: do you have an example
[17:16:33] <wcchandler> ohcibi: I plan on getting to that point, right now I'm starting simple then working my way up.  Am I completely off basis on this and should "shoot for the stars?"
[17:16:47] <ohcibi> bonhoeffer: for the line you mentioned: $('<div>').attr({id: 'e_' + s_id}).appendTo(select_field.parent());
[17:17:05] <bonhoeffer> nice
[17:17:17] <bonhoeffer> much better
[17:17:57] <ohcibi> wcchandler: thats no stars... its different... you have to process that value in a method called a 'callback' and you _need_ to no about this to do ajax... otherwise it makes no sense to work on any php-script returning something
[17:21:01] <ohcibi> wcchandler: to give an answer for your question .get('url', param); takes a function as a second 'param' to be executed when to request was successful... this method is the 'callback'
[17:21:24] <ohcibi> wcchandler: the first argument is the data returned by the request
[17:21:51] <wcchandler> the callback would be a function of what I want to do with that data?
[17:22:12] <wcchandler> so instead of storing it and using it later, I would just do it right then?
[17:22:12] <ohcibi> wcchandler: exactly...
[17:22:22] <ohcibi> wcchandler: no thats not the point...
[17:22:26] <wcchandler> ha
[17:22:32] <ohcibi> wcchandler: the point is that you receive that data in that function
[17:22:55] <ohcibi> wcchandler: you can process it later, but you cant do anything like var = request because its _asynchronous_
[17:24:30] <ohcibi> wcchandler: thats why i said you need to know about this 8-)) an ajax statement is send to a background process which executes functions on certain situations (success, failure, etc.), these are callbacks and there you have to store or process your data...
[17:26:05] <fof> wcchandler: you cannot know how long the remote request may take, so rather than stopping execution until you get a response, you pass a callback which executes when it's you have a response
[17:26:45] <wcchandler> but I'm setting the var = 0 before calling .get
[17:26:52] <who_am_i> Hello
[17:27:13] <wcchandler> and doing action with the assumption of 0...  it can take however long it wants and do whatever later
[17:27:40] <ohcibi> wcchandler: its asynchronous... the execution of the script wont stop at .get('ur');
[17:27:53] <ohcibi> wcchandler: thats why .get() does not return the data responded by the get-request
[17:28:10] <ohcibi> wcchandler: this data is given as an argument to the callback-function
[17:28:25] <wcchandler> thank you :)  that's what I needed to hear
[17:29:56] <ohcibi> wcchandler: but be sure to know why you needed that... asynchronicity is not an easy struggle
[17:30:50] <wcchandler> I guess I should ask in here, how would you tackle this situation?  I'm looking to ping a ton of devices and update a div to be red or green based on if it's up or down.  I'm pinging the device and doing the logic in the php script.  should that return an updated div?
[17:31:17] <ohcibi> wcchandler: no it should return the status
[17:32:25] <wcchandler> the status of the call? (success, failure, whatever)
[17:32:28] <ohcibi> wcchandler: your web-app always acts as a data-source, so it should just return data - no presentational nor business logic
[17:32:33] <fof> it's not prescriptive though, though i would return the status also
[17:32:36] <ohcibi> wcchandler: of the device
[17:32:54] <wcchandler> that's what I was returning with 0 and 1 -- 0 down, 1 up
[17:33:07] <ohcibi> wcchandler: its pretty simple but thats what a data source should do
[17:33:20] <ohcibi> wcchandler: i'd wrap it into json just for the future, but in general this is enough
[17:33:51] <fof> it can get difficult to maintain if you have presentation in different layers
[17:34:05] <ohcibi> yes
[17:34:24] <wcchandler> entirely, which is why I was thinking of just grabbing the 0 or 1 and doing the magic after .get :/
[17:34:36] <ohcibi> wcchandler: this is jut right
[17:34:42] <ohcibi> wcchandler: your web-app is the data-source
[17:34:49] <ohcibi> wcchandler: the rest is presentation
[17:35:00] <fof> have a look at json_encode php method for future if you're return more than a bool
[17:35:35] <ohcibi> wcchandler: ^ if you wrap it into json directly, you can add more data easily in the future
[17:36:54] <wcchandler> ohcibi: that's another ball park, should I store the data to a file local on the server to limit overloading the network?  (I could potentially have this web app run by ~100 users at once)
[17:37:53] <wcchandler> have a php or whatever script running int he background just doing the legwork, storing results to files, then the php called function in ajax just pulls the info from that file?
[17:39:13] <ohcibi> wcchandler: the data stored on your server has nothing to do with the data js can process.... you always have to have a webservice which returns data via ajax to js... so if you want to store data you gotta decide between server-side storage, cookies, or localStorage
[17:39:55] <wcchandler> that was more of a backend question, and not totally relevant to js specific
[17:40:00] <ohcibi> wcchandler: the latter one is very interesting but you cant use it on a wide rang right now because not all browsers are supporting it properly (a fallback would mean to have webservice which handles the fallback)
[17:40:12] <ohcibi> wcchandler: store everything in DB
[17:40:30] <ohcibi> wcchandler: file-access is heavy
[17:41:16] <wcchandler> it would ideally be server side, otherwise there'd be data duplication
[17:41:54] <ohcibi> wcchandler: some data is special for clients, so you'd store them with a clients-ID-key... OR locally on the client - thats why its interesting
[17:42:04] <ohcibi> wcchandler: clients-id-keys are a mess
[17:42:20] <ohcibi> wcchandler: think of shopping baskets in e-commerce
[17:42:40] <someprimetime> is previewing images before file upload possible to do?
[17:42:42] <wcchandler> yes, but even then you could do the majority of your legwork on the server side with a lot of hashing magic -- like craigslist authentication
[17:43:02] <someprimetime> use case: user selects 4 image files, create a small thumbnail based off of those to display
[17:43:13] <someprimetime> or would i need to upload them first then display them
[17:43:32] <ohcibi> wcchandler: 'a lot' is not _all_ and there are many good reasons for localStorage
[17:44:22] <ohcibi> wcchandler: not to store shopping baskets on a server is actually a privacy-issue
[17:44:50] <wcchandler> shopping basket contains no personally identifiable info
[17:45:10] <ohcibi> wcchandler: yes it does: the things you shopped 8-))
[17:45:33] <ohcibi> wcchandler: which a**l-p**g you bought the last time?? 8-))
[17:46:06] <ohcibi> wcchandler: the point is there _is_ data that is only need to be stored on the clients... so *store it there* 8-))
[17:46:07] <wcchandler> if I already bought it, why is it in my shopping basket now? ;)
[17:46:20] <wcchandler> yes, I agree
[17:46:24] <ohcibi> 8-)
[17:46:24] <ohcibi> good
[17:46:25] <ohcibi> 8-))
[17:46:41] <tieTYT> if I have a div, how do I find its parent that has the .row class?
[17:46:55] <ohcibi> closest('.row')
[17:47:00] <tieTYT> thanks
[17:52:17] <wcchandler> ohcibi: can I use my callback function, can I pass it other vars too, like a normal function?  if so, how is the function declaration handled?  or am I doing it wrong?
[17:53:02] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: if you use fileRead
[17:53:27] <ohcibi> wcchandler: the signature of a callback is defined by the function which triggers the callback, so you have to read it up in the docs... but the function definition itselfs happens as normal
[17:54:10] <ohcibi> wcchandler: just be sure that if you pass a function as an argument you leave the () since these would execute the function (passing the return value of it and not the function itself as a parameter)
[17:54:35] <atula> anyone from pastebin.com?
[17:55:06] <ohcibi> wcchandler: so if you have function callBack(argument) { alert(argument); }; you just pass method(callBack); not method(callBack());

[18:25:46] <atula> if you work at pastebin.com, could you message me? thanks
[18:26:25] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: if it exists? how would you check that? send an email and see if it doesnt bounce and hope that is good enough?
[18:26:48] <eddiemonge> if you work at pastebin.com could you redirect to jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net? thanks
[18:27:30] <Whirl3d> one way is to smtp into the supposed mail server and attempt to send a message as the user, if it bounces before sending, it's not valid
[18:27:32] <Whirl3d> http://verify-email.org/
[18:27:51] <Whirl3d> there are lots of ways to do it, I was hoping someone had a nice jquery compatible way that they preferred
[18:28:07] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: smtp into the mail server?
[18:28:28] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: if it was possible, which its highly doubtable that it is, thats all server side code
[18:28:35] <iateadonut> i've got an <a onclick='function1()'>text</a>, and i want to disable it.  when i use javascript to disable=true it, it is still clickable...
[18:28:48] <Whirl3d> eddiemonge: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_verification
[18:28:50] <iateadonut> so, i guess disable='true' isn't the thing to disable that... what is?
[18:29:03] <iateadonut> i've tried .unbind('click'), which didn't work either.
[18:29:16] <imsky> friday night gonna be all right
[18:29:22] <iateadonut> something that unbinds a handler that is there through the html code...
[18:30:06] <bonhoffer> eddiemonge, confused why this doesn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/4nEXy/9/
[18:30:28] <bonhoffer> .call(this), eddiemonge what do you think it does?
[18:30:40] <Whirl3d> iateadonut, maybe you want disabled="disabled", like $("elem').attr('disabled','disabled');
[18:31:00] <bonhoffer> or /10 is cleaner

[18:47:27] <someprimetime> but they are all prefixed by var and i'm not re-using this
[18:47:29] <eddiemonge> can you do console.log( this ) above the each and see what you are trying to run .each() on ?
[18:47:53] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: i see $(this) on three line right above each other
[18:48:13] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: this was done yesterday and after you told me the same thing in here i changed it but i guess id idn't hit "update" on the fiddle
[18:48:44] <gasull> eddiemonge: is the problem because of the jQuery version?
[18:49:25] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: try this and see what gets outputted http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/kTA4C/2/
[18:49:33] <razzi> has anybody used the cycle plugin with transparant images in IE?
[18:49:41] <eddiemonge> gasull: the base theme doesnt really have colors and stuff
[18:49:46] <razzi> the images get a dark outline during fade
[18:54:12] <Iarfen> Hi!!
[18:54:44] <Iarfen> When I use $.get() or $().load, how I can travel around directories for the url of the request??
[18:54:56] <someprimetime> what?
[18:55:02] <someprimetime> travel around directories what does that even mean?
[18:55:13] <someprimetime> you mean to sniff out what routes exist?
[18:55:35] <someprimetime> which unless you scrape the contents of their pages and look for all href links, you can't
[18:55:37] <Iarfen> someprimetime: I want to make a request to a file that isn't on the same directory has the file executes the jquery function
[18:55:54] <someprimetime> Iarfen: i have no idea what you are talking about
[18:55:59] <someprimetime> got a test case?
[18:56:27] <someprimetime> you want to request a file that isn't on the same directory.. ok.. but you are going to have to know what directory it is
[18:56:31] <someprimetime> you can't guess it
[18:56:37] <someprimetime> and jquery certainly can't either
[19:11:27] <Blaster> hey if I have 2 divs and I want to get the second one, can I use nth-child like $('div:nth-child(2)') ?
[19:11:34] <Blaster> if not, what's the better way?
[19:13:26] <imsky> Blaster: $("div:eq(1)")
[19:18:21] <angelazou> hi, quick question, does jquery have something like un-hover?
[19:18:59] <angelazou> I have this sliding menu, but it doesn't seem to be working correctly, I thought perhaps I need to reset the menu back to its original position after the mouse left?
[19:20:15] <angelazou> see paste here http://jsfiddle.net/M6hLH/
[19:20:31] <angelazou> in addition, if I try to go to one of the links, the menu closes immediately
[19:23:47] <wcchandler> i'm looking to use .get, but I don't care about passing the url any data, do I just have $.get("url",,function(),"text"); ?
[19:28:41] <angelazou> anyone?
[19:34:31] <outoftime> tinymce anyone? I need to define my own classes but not sure how that works.
[19:34:57] <outoftime> Orphis, if you know of a tinymce channel somewhere, that would be appreciated.
[19:35:26] <outoftime> or.. hmm phis? I didn't type that.
[19:37:40] <angelazou> Um... I went with the click event (although I really like hover), I've updated the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/M6hLH/1/
[19:38:01] <angelazou> however, I still don't know what to do to reset the whole thing
[19:38:21] <angelazou> I mean, I can click on the button to open the menu, but I'd have to click it again to close it
[19:38:40] <angelazou> is it possible to click else where and also close it?
[19:49:51] <twisted`> yo, I'm going a bit out of my head here. I got a (simple enough) form. I need to disable a certain select/option box in a certain case. However I need to check if it's disabled or not. Now I've tried (I think) 'em all: $('#element:disabled') or $('#element').is(':disabled') etc, however when I alert that I get back either true or false. Which is what I expect, however if I do either of those two in an if ($('#element:disabled') == false) it just somehow
[19:49:51] <twisted`> it...
[19:50:10] <twisted`> when it's disabled it goes into the if and it goes into the if when it's enabled :S
[19:50:15] <kara_sweets> if anybody could help figure out how to combine these two functions i would be forever gratefuL!!!!
[19:50:17] <kara_sweets> https://gist.github.com/1857273
[19:50:20] <twisted`> what am I doing wrong?
[19:50:30] <Eviltwin> twisted`: $('#element:disabled') is different from $('#element').is(':disabled')
[19:50:52] <twisted`> what is the difference? or which, should I use?
[19:51:01] <twisted`> I want to get the attr disabled value
[19:51:16] <Eviltwin> If you're trying to test whether a specific element is disabled, use the .is
[19:51:27] <abjorn> imsky, you're on here on a friday night
[19:51:27] <bot-t> (73 hours 10 mins ago) <imsky> tell abjorn for "nightmare" difficulty, do the first week again testing for ie6
[19:51:36] <Eviltwin> If you're trying to filter the elements that are disabled, use the other one
[19:51:43] <abjorn> WATS WIT DAT IMSKY
[19:51:51] <Eviltwin> kara_sweets: Why?
[19:51:57] <twisted`> Eviltwin: and what's the proper way to test? == 'true' or == true or === true ?
[19:52:13] <Eviltwin> It's a boolean
[19:52:18] <Eviltwin> So you don't actually need any of those
[19:52:31] <Eviltwin> if($("#element").is(":disabled")) { ... }
[19:52:46] <twisted`> let me test
[19:53:12] <kara_sweets> basically, the first part with the ajax request sends textual data to the server as part of the same post object, i.e. post with id = 1, however the fileUpload function sends the file as a different post object, i.e. post with id = 2;  im trying to get the form to submit all the data as part of the same post
[19:54:32] <Eviltwin> kara_sweets: You're probably not going to able to use FileTransfer
[19:54:49] <twisted`> \o/
[19:54:51] <twisted`> \o/
[19:54:55] <twisted`> how I missed this
[19:55:03] <twisted`> Eviltwin++
[19:55:08] <Eviltwin> I'm pretty sure it's described in detail on the API page
[19:55:24] <Eviltwin> twisted`: http://api.jquery.com/is/
[19:55:35] <kara_sweets> really?
[19:55:54] <kara_sweets> why is that? is it impossible to send both at the same time?
[19:56:15] <Eviltwin> At the same time or as part of one request?
[19:56:23] <kara_sweets> sorry, part of the same request
[19:56:28] <Eviltwin> Because FileTransfer appears to have the request logic internalized
[19:56:57] <twisted`> yeah I guess it's too much like 5am that I realised I can just check the docs
[19:58:18] <kara_sweets> ehhhhhhhhhhhh
[19:59:07] <kibble-> has anyone found a php class which is like xajax but using jquery's power and goodness and most importantly isn't dead?
[19:59:15] <kara_sweets> i dont have access to the file input type because this is for mobile uploads, do you have any suggestions to work around this?
[20:00:07] <Whirl3d> angelazoo, you still there?
[20:01:16] <ndss56> jQuery('<option selected="selected">'+$inputText+'</option>').insertBefore('option:last');
[20:01:36] <ndss56> any ideas why selected="selected" is not added?
[20:02:15] <Whirl3d> you have to select the element using it's parent and .val();
[20:02:20] <hlveheart> What's the best way to remove all/any iframes using jQuery?
[20:02:39] <hlveheart> Stupid site got hacked again.
[20:02:41] <hlveheart> >:/
[20:03:10] <Whirl3d> var item=$('<option>'+$inputText+'</option>').insertBefore('option:last'); item.closest("select").val(item.val());
[20:03:38] <Whirl3d> a guess?
[20:03:59] <hlveheart> Could I use $('IFrame').empty(); ?
[20:04:27] <ndss56> Whirl3d: sure, but what is the logic as to why selected="selected" not showing?
[20:04:51] <Whirl3d> can you have multiple selected elements?
[20:05:13] <ndss56> Whirl3d: nope
[20:05:30] <Whirl3d> Then how do you expect the currently selected element to deselect itself?
[20:05:34] <ndss56> Whirl3d: so you think something is already selected?
[20:05:56] <hlveheart> Anyone?
[20:06:30] <Whirl3d> or maybe something just ignores the selected attribute when adding an option to a select element.
[20:07:03] <ndss56> Whirl3d: i assume if you specify an option to be selected="selected" then the other option is auto de-selected.
[20:07:16] <Whirl3d> hiveheart, Eviltwin is the best source for your question. I have no idea, sorry.
[20:07:32] <Whirl3d> you mean, auto-magically?
[20:08:38] <ndss56> Whirl3d: Thanks for your help.
[20:09:08] <Whirl3d> np, sorry I don't have more technical explanations for you. Eviltwin could explain better when/if he returns
[20:09:40] <ndss56> Why? is he a pro around here?
[20:10:20] <Whirl3d> undoubtedly one of the best. Arguable the most generous and helpful.
[20:11:30] <Whirl3d> But he gets abused often, so don't bug him unless you can't figure it out yourself. He helps a lot of people every day and goes largely unappreciated in my opinion. It's like people think they are entitled to such generosity.
[20:12:00] <ndss56> :)
[20:12:34] <ndss56> I don't think I had the pleasure of EvilTwin helps yet...
[20:21:24] <ndss56> in javascript/jquery, is it possible/normal to escape input (<input>) data?
[20:23:03] <Whirl3d> for what?
[20:23:26] <ndss56> to prevent script injection
[20:23:55] <ndss56> that data maybe saved into a database for example
[20:24:12] <tw2113> wouldn't that be better left to server side?
[20:24:29] <tw2113> or at least rechecked there
[20:24:49] <ndss56> tw2113: yes server-side, but can client-side do it as well?
[20:25:17] <tw2113> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[20:26:05] <tw2113> zadasnotes.blogspot.com/2011/06/jquery-tip-sanitize-input-fields.html
[20:27:38] <ndss56> tw2113: thanks
[20:29:29] <ndss56> tw2113: second thought, sanitising and validating is not the same as escaping...i think.
[20:29:51] <ndss56> tw2113: maybe better left for server-side only.
[20:34:14] <tw2113> i'm sure it's possible with some sort of js equivalent of str_replace and whatnot
[20:34:32] <tw2113> turn < into &lt; etc
[20:35:20] <Banaticus> Are there jquery commands which would let me create an IRC server webapp?
[20:35:49] <sneakyness> what
[20:36:19] <sneakyness> Banaticus: go look at the rewrite of freenode's shitty webchat on github
[20:37:59] <Whirl3d> doesn't jquery have an encode method...brb
[20:38:16] <meadhikari> I know this method is wrong please show me the correct way of doint it https://gist.github.com/1857434
[20:41:18] <danzik17> meadhikari: $( "#pos1, #pos2, #pos3, #pos4, #pos5, #pos6" ).map( function() { return this.value } );
[20:42:27] <ndss56> Whirl3d: i haven't seen any encode method...
[20:42:41] <tw2113> ?map
[20:42:41] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[20:42:56] <ndss56> ?map
[20:42:56] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[20:43:56] <tw2113> cool
[20:44:41] <ndss56> tw2113+++
[20:45:05] <tw2113> i figure observing others is a good way to see what's possible with jquery
[20:45:17] <tw2113> ndss56 don't i know you from #wordpress?
[20:45:22] <Whirl3d> http://www.prodevtips.com/2008/10/21/jquery-plugin-html-decode-and-encode/
[20:45:59] <ndss56> tw2113: you are my best friend on #wordpress
[20:47:07] <tw2113> i'm glad i set the bar so low
[20:47:46] <ndss56> Whirl3d: Thanks
[20:48:58] <feathersanddown> I want that a dropdown chango to other page at onchange event
[20:49:05] <feathersanddown> what I need to do? a redirect?
[20:49:53] <ndss56> tw2113: beggers can't be choosy
[20:50:11] <ndss56> bye bye
[20:50:24] * tw2113 notes to stop begging
[20:51:00] <wcchandler> okay so I'm finally understanding the whole Asynchronous thing.  It'll evaluate the callback function with whatever, but then it's never reentering that function to re-evaluate the data that's returned...  right?
[20:51:35] <Whirl3d> $(el).change(function () {window.location=$(el).attr("href");});
[20:52:20] <danzik17> tw2113: here's an encoding trick that i came up with a while ago:  http://jsfiddle.net/cRVb2/1/
[20:53:13] <Whirl3d> wcchandler, i think it continues the function without needing a response. The callback isn't fired until the event that triggers the callback is fired.
[20:53:22] <Whirl3d> lol
[20:53:44] <Whirl3d> Now that I read that, i am sure that I am brain damaged.
[20:54:55] <wcchandler> but it doesn't wait for the response...  so if it takes 1s for the response, that's 1s it spent running the callback function, no?
[20:55:53] <danzik17> wcchandler: no, that's the whole point of an async call.  the callback doesn't happen until you get a response, even if its 10 seconds later.
[20:56:23] <Whirl3d> it only runs the callback AFTER the event has finished or errored out
[20:56:35] <imsky> abjorn: left the client running. what's good brah
[20:56:36] <Whirl3d> but it doesn't hold you up to do other things while waiting
[21:03:32] <cleric> in #bodyContent the # denotes an id. what denotes a class?
[21:03:40] <tw2113> .
[21:04:03] <cleric> whats the sign that goes with a class?
[21:04:11] <tw2113> ^
[21:04:17] <tw2113> .class
[21:04:41] <cleric> $('bodyContent.class ul li a').each(function (j, a) {}
[21:04:47] <smplstk> .i-can-haz-cheezeburg
[21:04:48] <cleric> if bodyContent was a class
[21:04:50] <cleric> like that?
[21:04:56] <tw2113> no
[21:05:00] <tw2113> .bodyContent
[21:05:07] <smplstk> ^^
[21:05:07] <cleric> oh. ok thanks
[21:05:17] <tw2113> same as CSS
[21:05:31] <angelazou> [11:18] <angelazou> hi, quick question, does jquery have something like un-hover?
[21:05:37] <angelazou> [11:18] <angelazou> I have this sliding menu, but it doesn't seem to be working correctly, I thought perhaps I need to reset the menu back to its original position after the mouse left?
[21:05:46] <angelazou> see paste here http://jsfiddle.net/M6hLH/
[21:05:57] <angelazou>  in addition, if I try to go to one of the links, the menu closes immediately
[21:07:37] <Whirl3d> angelazou, the reason it keeps messing up is that hover registers the mouseleave event when the cursor leaves the img
[21:07:45] <Whirl3d> just like you tell it to.
[21:08:14] <angelazou> um, actually, I've changed it to click, I updated it here http://jsfiddle.net/M6hLH/31/
[21:08:16] <Whirl3d> if you bind the hover *event* to the image parent, it might work better
[21:08:33] <angelazou> I only have 2 questions now
[21:08:57] <angelazou> 1- how can I make the menu roll back to its position when the user clicks elsewhere
[21:09:16] <angelazou> oh, actually just one
[21:09:36] <angelazou> is there an un-click event?
[21:09:45] <angelazou> or should I use blur?
[21:09:51] <wcchandler> if somebody feels like being a saint tonight: http://chandler.mooo.com/test.html  please tell me why this isn't working...
[21:10:34] <tw2113> define not working
[21:11:14] <wcchandler> tw2113: divs 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.1.1 should all be green, not grey, the rest should be red not grey
[21:11:43] <wcchandler> it's almost like it's not evaluating the data I pass to it in the callback function correctly
[21:12:30] <abjorn> yo imsky
[21:12:32] <abjorn> long week
[21:12:34] <abjorn> etc etc
[21:12:45] <imsky> abjorn: so i herd
[21:13:37] <tw2113> i wonder if you're not passing in data to the update function
[21:16:47] <wcchandler> tw2113: that's entirely what I was thinking, too.  but I couldn't find ANYWHERE a way to tell it the data, that example just seemed to work for everyone
[21:17:18] <Whirl3d> angelzou, try this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/M6hLH/40/
[21:18:00] <wcchandler> if I add document.write(data) it returns "undefined"
[21:18:47] <LukeNukem> Anyone have experience with uploadify?

[21:37:28] <paul_irish> yah bro
[21:37:31] <Eviltwin> Please add your ~/.* to a git repository
[21:37:33] <Eviltwin> And link it to paul_irish
[21:37:39] <imsky> i'll do so post haste
[21:37:40] <paul_irish> o.o
[21:37:48] <paul_irish> hot
[21:38:04] <paul_irish> i jumped on to the github'd dotfiles gravy train a little bit ago
[21:38:14] <paul_irish> i like being able to pull it down to any server i go into
[21:38:15] <paul_irish> but
[21:38:20] <paul_irish> they all look the same now!
[21:38:25] <Eviltwin> I don't want to pay for private repos
[21:38:27] <paul_irish> like i'm gonna read the machine IE
[21:38:29] <paul_irish> ID
[21:38:30] <Eviltwin> And I don't really want them public
[21:38:47] <paul_irish> Eviltwin: yeah the ones i have use a nice mechanism to pull in a .extras file
[21:38:49] <imsky> paul_irish: so why do you need my dotfiles brah
[21:38:53] <paul_irish> that is kept out via gitignore
[21:38:54] <imsky> you making copies?
[21:39:15] <paul_irish> because i'm curious if you got cool tricksss
[21:39:26] <imsky> yeah my biggest trick is Ctrl+R
[21:39:31] <paul_irish> damn bro
[21:39:32] <paul_irish> that's cool
[21:39:37] <imsky> it is amazing i know
[21:39:42] <imsky> but now that i think about it
[21:39:48] <imsky> if you're gonna screencast a terminal session
[21:40:02] <imsky> why not do it real html5 like and sync up html5 <audio> to just some HTML changing
[21:40:16] <imsky> the wat talk is more of a failure than i previously imagined
[21:42:17] <imsky> "array plus array is...empty string <GIDDY AUDIENCE LAUGHTER>"
[21:42:18] <imsky> oh god
[21:42:41] <Eviltwin> Nice
[21:42:51] <Eviltwin> For empty arrays
[21:43:32] <Juanlajara> Hey guys, how much time to develop front-end IN the browser? I mean like the whole thing
[21:43:42] <paul_irish> hmm?
[21:43:55] <tw2113> isn't that where you are the whole time?
[21:44:20] <Juanlajara> you see the results there, i mean like the text editor in the browser
[21:44:34] <Juanlajara> inside the browser
[21:44:34] <tw2113> sublime text
[21:45:06] <tw2113> firebug a lot
[21:46:02] <Juanlajara> yep there are this fancy tools like chrome dev tools and autosave
[21:46:53] <Juanlajara> but maybe a jsfiddle to real develop a site and then like commit, but anyways it was a thought of mine
[21:48:12] <tw2113> i figure fiddle is for easy sharing with others
[21:49:41] <tw2113> and obvious debugging issues with others' hep
[21:49:42] <tw2113> help*
[21:55:44] <Juanlajara> ya but imagine this situation where you only have your browser and you really like to work on this idea, where'd you go? you can't access sublime or something, you only have the browser and internet connection
[21:56:35] <Juanlajara> you really want*
[21:56:50] <tw2113> obviously it has uses like that, i'm just going based off of my personal experiences so far
[21:57:05] <tw2113> and when would i not have access to my usual dev tools when laptops are so portable? :P
[21:58:01] <imsky> Juanlajara: sounds like you want https://kodingen.com/
[22:00:43] <Juanlajara> that looks nice, but I rather have it like *inside* the browser, as a feature maybe
[22:01:15] <imsky> oh ok, well firefox and chrome are open source. get cracking buddy
[22:01:23] <Juanlajara> haha
[22:01:55] <Juanlajara> I don't think I have the knowledge to do that, but I am trying to learn, thanks
[22:17:04] <zelo> i need to display yui dialog box on link click and if user confirms it should load  that link. The problem is that it maps current page link instead of url href. If someone could look at my code i would be really greatfull. http://jsfiddle.net/DG8jD/1/
[22:25:07] <zelo> http://jsfiddle.net/DG8jD/2/ ^ here is updated link
[22:33:03] <ndss56> zelo: whats wrong with it?
[22:39:09] <zelo> ndss56 it takes current page url instead of "targeted" a href. I "mean" targeted because i'm sure that i did it wrong.
[22:40:21] <zelo> ndss56 if you run it you will see that it loads http://fiddle.jshell.net/DG8jD/2/show/ instead of /delete/3
[22:40:21] <ndss56> zelo: what are you referring to as current page url and targetted?
[22:40:47] <ndss56> okay
[22:41:31] <zelo> i want execute /delete/3 page by get but before that i want user to confirm.
[22:45:02] <ndss56> i dont see anywhere http://fiddle.jshell.net/DG8jD/2/show/
[22:48:07] <zelo> ndss56 does it properly work for you ?
[22:49:47] <zelo> ndss56 in my case in chrome dev tools in network tab i see get to fiddle.net and it doesnt have /delete/3 on the path. It just asks current page
[22:50:17] <ndss56> ok
[22:50:55] <bnb_dev> Hello
[22:51:15] <zelo> ndss56 for example fiddle code lays in iframe from here http://fiddle.jshell.net/DG8jD/2/show/ and when i confirm on box it make gets to same url
[22:51:32] <bnb_dev> i am opening a from  in Juqery ui dialog using Jquery ajax
[22:51:45] <ndss56> zelo: why you think $.get() will change url?
[22:51:47] <zelo> ndss56 so it just doesnt have good target but i have no idea how to fix it
[22:52:03] <zelo> ndss56 i dont want to change url but i want to make get request to that url
[22:52:20] <bnb_dev> on the form i made a button close, but when i click on close button it's not closing the dialog
[22:52:21] <zelo> and this is how it works. It just get not that url which i would like to be
[22:52:33] <bnb_dev> ?
[22:57:58] <ndss56> zelo: http://jsfiddle.net/DG8jD/3/
[23:06:24] <zelo> ndsa56 thanks
[23:06:30] <zelo> ndss56^
[23:09:24] <ndss56> zelo: np
[23:20:44] <hlveheart> Anybody know what type of encryption this is using? http://pastebin.com/bV8HLTG5
[23:20:47] <hlveheart> >:/
[23:24:13] <donCams> is that google's?
[23:41:32] <cleric> how can the each loop get the value inside this div? <div class="calprice">USD 161</div>
[23:41:38] <cleric> should i say a.div?
[23:43:05] <Eviltwin> ?
[23:43:55] <cleric> i want the text inside the div
[23:44:23] <cleric> $('.calprice').each(function (j, a) {}
[23:44:27] <cleric> thats my each loop
[23:46:17] <cleric> and i get undefined from $(this).div
[23:47:00] <Eviltwin> I think you might need to learn jQuery
[23:47:13] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure what you think $(this).div is supposed to accomplish
[23:47:50] <cleric> i was following a solution on stack overflow
[23:48:09] <Eviltwin> Sounds like a mistake
[23:48:13] <Eviltwin> Which one?
[23:48:21] <cleric> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4735342/jquery-to-loop-through-elements-with-the-same-class
[23:48:49] <Eviltwin> I don't see anything like $(this).div here
[23:49:15] <cleric> look a the second answer
[23:49:27] <Eviltwin> I don't see anything like $(this).div here
[23:49:41] <cleric> $(this) doesnt help either
[23:49:52] <Eviltwin> Again, I think you need to learn jQuery
[23:49:55] <Eviltwin> ?learn
[23:49:55] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[23:50:06] <Eviltwin> Those are good places to start
[23:50:23] <cleric> and how do i get the text?
[23:50:50] <Eviltwin> That's a jQuery 101 question
[23:50:58] <Eviltwin> Answered in that second link
[23:51:44] <Eviltwin> cleric: But I'll get you started on your way see ?html see ?text
[23:51:45] <bot-t> cleric, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[23:51:45] <bot-t> cleric, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[23:55:14] <cleric> it works!
[23:57:11] <cleric> O.o well thank you even though you were stingy
[23:57:29] <Eviltwin> Well, we're strong believers in RTFM here
[23:57:40] <Eviltwin> And we have a pretty damn good manual
[23:59:36] <cleric> i cant memorize a whole manual.all i need is the name of a function that i can go and read about
[23:59:53] <Eviltwin> If you had searched "html" or "text" on that page
