[00:13:55] <marshy_> any opinions on Knockout?
[00:18:11] <Xotix> Isthere a jquery plguin like codemirror.net?
[00:27:26] <purefusion2> how might I go about looping a navbar's list elements, and fading in each item, one at a time
[00:27:50] <purefusion2> if I simply do a loop, they all fade in at nearly the same time
[00:28:41] <purefusion2> so I need to use a callback function, but not sure how to do this with the loop in mind
[00:28:58] <purefusion2> or maybe there's an easier way
[00:32:01] <Xotix> Is someone using coremirror? Is it crossbrowser compatible?
[00:34:45] <someprimetime> what is the best way to remove/add a class with a fade?
[00:34:59] <someprimetime> i'm trying to get around the "flashing" that happens
[00:35:15] <Cork> someprimetime: jquery-ui has it built in
[00:35:18] <someprimetime> i guess including query ui and using the toggleClass('className', 500) works
[00:35:23] <someprimetime> but is there another option?
[00:35:48] <Cork> not really
[00:36:12] <Cork> you would have to do the animation your self if you don't want jquery-ui
[00:36:32] <someprimetime> ah word
[00:37:03] <someprimetime> think it'd be worth it to add a background to my image instead?
[00:37:10] <someprimetime> like add an opacity background
[00:37:18] <someprimetime> which is what i'm doing currently with an image
[00:37:32] <someprimetime> would that be pretty x-browser supportive?
[00:39:47] <walid> someprimetime: check css3 as well
[00:40:05] <walid> transition
[00:41:15] <someprimetime> cool thanks walid, but unfortunately this needs to be done in jquery which i know it will work in the majority of browsers
[00:42:13] <walid> css 3 works in all recent updates except ie
[00:42:27] <walid> and you can try and use pie for ie
[00:43:18] <someprimetime> word thanks
[00:44:21] <Kuni> Eviltwin: mind if I ask what is bizzare about those selectors?
[00:45:21] <dr0id> Xotix: should be
[00:45:43] <opalepatrick> Is there a plugin or tutorial that would cycle images in a folder without marking up the html? Just automatically rotate through images in a given folder.
[00:46:37] <opalepatrick> I only mean the html re the images not the rest :-)
[00:46:43] <dr0id> their website says it explicitly :P
[00:47:42] <nikolaus> hello
[00:48:09] <nikolaus> i got a problem with jquery and prototype
[00:49:29] <someprimetime> how can i make a double click not select a container?
[00:49:52] <someprimetime> like i'll double click on an element and its entire container gets highlighted
[00:50:10] <mindis|wurk> hello. i was wondering if anyone could tip me what i'm doing wrong with a js class like this: function something() { this.foo = "bar"; this.foo2.draggable({ drag: function(event, ui) { // trying to refer to this.foo but it's no longer defined here }}); }
[00:50:28] <Cork> someprimetime: you would have to remove the selection on dbclick
[00:50:34] <nikolaus> i want to use jquery in the whole page and prototype in just one function(so i wanna use jquerry then prototype an then jquerry again) how do i do that (with no conflict i can only use jquery then prototype )
[00:50:48] <Cork> someprimetime: or simple forbid selection of the element
[00:50:58] <Cork> *simply
[00:51:00] <someprimetime> Cork: i'll do that thx
[01:19:32] <Homere> hello
[01:21:27] <kollapse> Hi. Does this jquery popup plugin look alright - http://jsfiddle.net/SA9ua/46/ ?
[01:23:54] <toxz> how can i select all elements which are not from a class in the selector? something like  $('tr not(.cssClass)')
[01:23:55] <toxz> ?
[01:24:41] <jayflux> $('tr:not(".cssClass")';)
[01:24:44] <jayflux> $('tr:not(".cssClass")');
[01:24:57] <jayflux> $('tr *:not(".cssClass")');
[01:25:10] <jayflux> $('tr *:not(".cssClass")); even better
[01:25:15] <kollapse> :)
[01:25:32] <xec> but that will select every descendant
[01:25:36] <[1]Bram> tr[class!=cssClass] :)
[01:25:50] <jayflux> he wants to select all element doesnt he?
[01:25:57] <jayflux> or does he just mean all tr elements
[01:26:11] <xec> $('tr').not('.cssClass') <-- i assume this is what he wants
[01:26:22] <jayflux> oic
[01:26:51] <jayflux> yeah if you just want all tr's within the parent that don't have that class then yeah what xec said
[01:26:51] <xec> or your first suggestion should work too
[01:27:04] <risky_s> hi
[01:27:05] <toxz> jayflux - thx i ll give it a try now
[01:27:37] <toxz> i know about .not
[01:27:49] <toxz> but i wanted to have it in my selector
[01:28:18] <risky_s> i am having problems with refreshing a page when I do 'window.location=window.location' when in the url there is a #... after the .php
[01:28:26] <jayflux> toxz:  it doesnt really matter, they do the same thing almost
[01:28:36] <Cork> risky_s: window.location.reload() ?
[01:28:54] <risky_s> one sec i'll try
[01:29:01] <jayflux> toxz: if you want it in your selector just use $('tr:not(".cssClass")');
[01:30:27] <Braden`> Hello
[01:31:00] <Braden`> Does anyone know of a tutorial that shows how to design a search box that changes its list whenever another character is added?
[01:31:50] <edgardo> Braden`, google ajax live search or something
[01:32:01] <Braden`> ok
[01:34:31] <xec> kollapse: are there any parts of you plugin you are struggling with specifically?
[01:35:40] <kollapse> xec: It works fine but I'm wondering whether it's optimal performance-wise or a bad idea.
[01:35:45] <xec> kollapse: readability is near zero, with not a single comment and variable names like "obj", "k" and "v"
[01:36:17] <kollapse> Well k and v are key and value from jquery's $.each function used on standard objects.
[01:36:52] <xec> but they do a very bad job at portraying intent
[01:36:56] <jayflux> xec: what are $.callbacks() about? When will they be useful in a real world situation?
[01:37:37] <xec> jayflux: i'm not sure, haven't had a look
[01:38:36] <xec> kollapse: and as a result, i mostly get the idea of what the plugin does from the HTML and end result
[01:38:46] <Mech0z> Is there a specific event I can put on a class so if its marked and a key is pressed the event is fired
[01:38:50] <Mech0z> triggerd*
[01:42:13] <xec> Mech0z: i'm not sure what you mean, by "put on a class" and "marked"
[01:46:08] <Ankabout> Hi, I have a background image using background-size: cover;    and on the same page I have a jquery animation, but that's jumpy because the page size changes when it animates
[01:46:12] <Ankabout> how can I avoid that?
[01:47:55] <risky_s> window.location.reload() doesnt work with the hash
[01:48:02] <risky_s> hash in the url i mean
[01:48:23] <risky_s> i have a login page but when i have a # in the url it doesnt refresh
[01:51:08] <edgardo> where does the hash come from then?
[01:52:00] <SargoDarya> Hey guys, I know it's not really jquery related but does anyone of you use knockout.js?
[01:52:05] <Cork> risky_s: what browser does't window.location.reload() work in?
[01:52:10] <risky_s>  for instance when a link has a href
[01:52:10] <Cork> doesn
[01:52:28] <risky_s> im using firefox
[01:53:03] <Cork> http:/example.com/url#testing reloads for me
[01:53:19] <edgardo> you mean <a href="#"
[01:53:26] <Mech0z> xec: $('.diary_should_update_clock').keypress(function() thats what I meant :)
[01:53:39] <risky_s> its when I using a login area in my page it doesn't reload
[01:53:49] <xec> SargoDarya: i've only started playing with it, but just ask, if noone can answer, they won't ;)
[01:53:55] <risky_s> it needs to refresh and show the content for that user
[01:54:05] <Cork> then its something else, .reload() don't care if theres a hach or not
[01:54:15] <mindis|wurk> if i define an element through css top and bottom properties, is there a good way to get its actual height?
[01:54:18] <Cork> its the same as hitting the reload
[01:54:23] <Cork> + button
[01:54:52] <SargoDarya> oh, I'm stupid. It was only a typo. Thanks anyway xec
[01:56:05] <LekeFly> How can i create this.. http://cl.ly/3N3j3R2D043g2m3v230r ?
[01:56:29] <xec> Mech0z: and this class, is it on a input?
[01:56:48] <Mech0z> that class is attached to a textbox
[01:57:01] <Mech0z> so when I press a key inside that textbox the event is fired/triggered
[01:58:38] <xec> Mech0z: i still don't get the question, if this works
[01:59:01] <Mech0z> this worked, I am just saying taht I found the solution
[01:59:09] <xec> oh allright, i see :)
[02:00:53] <Mech0z> xec any idear how I make this not run if its tab that is pressed inside the textbox?
[02:01:04] <Mech0z> I dont want it to activate if the user tabs over the textfield
[02:02:21] <xec> Mech0z: you can check e.keyCode === 9
[02:02:30] <Mech0z> 9 = tab?
[02:02:56] <xec> i think so, you can log and check
[02:05:35] <xec> Mech0z: http://jsfiddle.net/qaLyz/
[02:08:30] <Mech0z> apparently its only firefox 3.6 (dont know about newer) that activates keypress on tab, chrome and IE8 dont
[02:08:42] <Mech0z> but need to work in IE8 and ff3.6 so need to fix it^^
[02:09:24] <Mech0z> hmm with your code its not possible to tab over the field :s
[02:09:36] <Mech0z> it just stops at the one before, so it overwrites the tab method in firefox
[02:10:36] <_ramo> hi
[02:10:54] <Mech0z> xec: changed it to this http://jsfiddle.net/qaLyz/1/ then ti works
[02:11:04] <Mech0z> having the return false makes it not run the normal tab opperation
[02:11:11] <_ramo> i would like to add div's per click on a link to a site . currently i have: http://privatepaste.com/f5c5416f43/dsaf  but this is not working...
[02:11:32] <Theaxiom> anyone know why an hmac generated on PHP is different than one generated in Javascript using the same key?
[02:13:06] <AWizzArd> I have a textarea and set its contents to a string s. Is it possible to let the string slowly slideDown() into the empty textarea? If yes, how could this be done? I saw that there is a slideDown function.
[02:14:00] <Theaxiom> AWizzArd, you can only do that in HTML5 with special divs, not textareas
[02:14:16] <AWizzArd> Ah okay, I see. Thanks.
[02:15:09] <xec> Mech0z: you know, !== is the opposite of === ;)
[02:15:30] <Mech0z> true :p
[02:16:22] <xec> and yes, i did the return false on purpose, to be able to continue checking what key returned what code after pressing tab
[02:25:52] <_ramo> how can i add divs into another div with jquery?
[02:26:25] <edgardo> of course
[02:27:05] <edgardo> $('divYouWantToAddTo').html('whatever html code you want to add inside that div');
[02:28:20] <xec> that will overwrite whatever content you had there
[02:28:41] <xec> _ramo: see ?append and see ?appendTo
[02:28:59] <RLa> there are prepend, append, prependTo, appendTO
[02:29:09] <edgardo> he didn't specify that :)
[02:29:12] <xec> silly bot. _ramo: http://api.jquery.com/append/
[02:29:21] <xec> edgardo: he said "add" not "replace"
[02:29:38] <edgardo> but what if it's empty to begin with?
[02:29:41] <RLa> for replace there are replaceWith and replaceAll
[02:29:46] <_ramo> currently i found appendTo
[02:29:49] <edgardo> just for the purpose of adding stuff into it
[02:29:49] <_ramo> thanks you
[02:30:44] <_ramo> xec: i would like to build a commenting system likek facebook has it...
[02:31:08] <xec> you, facebook already has that
[02:31:10] <xec> you know*
[02:31:47] <_ramo> xec: what do you mean?
[02:32:08] <_ramo> i know that facebook has this comments... but i want to build on on my one... not using that from facebook
[02:32:45] <coldhead> people would prefer to use facebook's, _ramo
[02:32:56] <coldhead> because people are idiots
[02:32:57] <xec> ok, but my point was that facebook allows you to add their commenting system to any page
[02:33:15] <coldhead> just use the facebook one and go play in the park or something
[02:33:33] <xec> and if you want "commenting system likek facebook" you can get one exactly like it. from facebook. ;)
[02:34:45] <edgardo> I made my own "facebook likek comment system" but for a page completely not related to fb
[02:35:27] <edgardo> if you think about that with "likek" you might mean that the principle is the same but does not actually have anything to do with facebook per se
[02:51:23] <dr0id> I think making your own commeenting system these days wouldn't be cool
[02:52:23] <dr0id> facebook/disqus comments = more users allowed toc omment = more stupid interaction = more content = more traffic = more revenue via ads :P
[02:52:51] <edgardo> heh
[02:52:51] <dr0id> was quite skeptical myself, but did it day bef yest on one of my sites
[02:53:05] <dr0id> disqus, that is
[02:54:07] <edgardo> well, I did not make it to actually use it.. I made it to learn how to make it :)
[02:54:57] <edgardo> when I started playing around with jquery, ajax and php
[02:56:48] <StPiere> i have nested ul li lists , like here ... http://jsfiddle.net/ZNU7h/ .. how to select $('.active').find('li') but only to get the level 2 elements ?
[02:57:18] <StPiere> i mean level 2 LI 's
[02:58:15] <StPiere> css equivalent would be li.active > ul > li
[03:01:24] <Leka> StPiere: something like this i suppose: $("active li").bind("click", function(){});
[03:02:08] <Leka> StPiere: ah, forgot what i said, i didn't quiet understand the question at first
[03:04:11] <StPiere> i think i found the answer $('.active').find('ul:first > li')
[03:07:45] <ravenzz> do you think that is silly to merge jquery and jquery ui effects, so I don't have to require both jquery and jquery ui...just for some easing effects more?
[03:09:19] <coldhead> ravenzz: http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/jquery.easing.1.3.js
[03:10:09] <coldhead> you can just use those?
[03:10:54] <ravenzz> yea well, the point it 1 vs 2 requests
[03:11:00] <ravenzz> is*
[03:11:05] <Xotix> If im using tabs. Is there any css difference which i should care of? somehow my floating doesn't work.
[03:12:00] <Leka> ravenzz: you could include a file, which in turn includes all your scripts. seeing that you may end up with more than 2 after a while - this is a easy way to always have 1 include, and said document includes your "library"
[03:12:45] <Leka> i don't know if that follows standards though
[03:13:36] <coldhead> you should use whatever files you need and then get closure compiler or something to bundle them all up for you into a single minified blob
[03:13:50] <ravenzz> yup
[03:13:54] <coldhead> thats good practice
[03:15:27] <dr0id> why is jQuery so awesome ?
[03:16:29] <Leka> dr0id: http://jquery.com/ :)
[03:16:46] <dr0id> heh
[03:18:28] <ravenzz> as much as this http://www.liquidgeneration.com/Baby-On-Board
[03:19:16] <coldhead> john resig is very clever
[03:19:51] <dr0id> what happened to coldQuery ?
[03:23:35] <coldhead> it's not open source
[03:51:53] <davetarmac> hi guys
[03:52:34] <davetarmac> n00b question of the day: how do I find out if a css value for the 'left' is !> 114
[03:52:46] <davetarmac> tried if (($("#quote-quoteleft").css("left")) !> "114") { â€¦ } but no joy
[03:53:13] <davetarmac> I get the error: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token > in my console
[03:53:29] <coldhead> the ! should go before the a > b comparison
[03:53:45] <coldhead> but really its simpler to say a <= b
[03:54:04] <xh> trying to make a frames version of the Enable All Text Selection bookmarklet by Alan Hogan, but cannot get it to work, could someone please help identify the problem? https://gist.github.com/1485772 I'm using the jsbuilder to minify/format the bookmarklet code
[03:54:14] <davetarmac> ah right

[03:54:24] <davetarmac> that's good to know, and it's working now - thanks coldhead
[03:56:25] <JWay> is there a way to get all fields of class=lol that are not empty?
[03:56:37] <JWay> *a simple/jquery way
[03:57:37] <Braden`> jQuery('#searchContainer input[name="q"]').liveSearch({'/search-ajax/' + '&q='});  <--- ERROR:  Expected ':'
[03:57:55] <Braden`> What does that mean?
[03:59:05] <davetarmac> hmm - this is interesting
[03:59:20] <davetarmac> what is the numerical metric that jQuery uses?
[03:59:32] <davetarmac> oh hang on
[04:01:54] <Blaster> hey is there a way to undo e.preventDefault() ?
[04:03:52] <davetarmac> OK, this isn't working as I'd hoped
[04:04:01] <davetarmac> I think I'm missing something dead simple
[04:04:20] <davetarmac> if (($("#quote-quoteleft").css("left")) <= "110px") { â€¦ }
[04:04:58] <davetarmac> actually - hold on
[04:05:00] <davetarmac> http://www.pastie.org/3025996
[04:05:05] <davetarmac> that's what I'm trying to do
[04:05:17] <davetarmac> but stop the animation at a certain value
[04:05:39] <davetarmac> but it seems to stop when the value of left = 6px

[04:13:53] <shell0x> hi
[04:14:17] <shell0x> I need some help with jquery validation again ;)
[04:14:30] <malydok> <hover() function> can anyone please take a look and tell why this is not working: http://jsfiddle.net/qK8Uu/13/
[04:14:56] <shell0x> i have multiple field with the name myform[name]. So i do validation with jquery and check if the input matches a regex
[04:15:10] <shell0x> This works fine but only for the last field :(
[04:15:16] <shell0x> the first field seems to be ignored
[04:15:28] <shell0x> *fieldname = myform[name][]
[04:15:34] <Braden`> Anyone?
[04:19:25] <davetarmac> my js skills are very weak - I'm having bother with simple stuff
[04:20:26] <xec> malydok: try "function () {}" not "function {}"
[04:20:28] <davetarmac> that pastie code I posted earlier - the anim stops at left: 2px; rather than the 110px it needs to be
[04:22:23] <malydok> xec, oh my, what a school mistake. but somehow it still refuses to work
[04:22:37] <malydok> http://jsfiddle.net/qK8Uu/14/
[04:22:57] <xec> malydok: there is still a myriad of mistakes there, do you have firebug? or another javascript console?
[04:23:46] <xec> malydok: separate  object properties with "," not ";"
[04:24:01] <xec> malydok: use numbers for margins (omit the "px")
[04:24:42] <xec> malydok: use "margin-left" with quotes or marginLeft for object key
[04:24:53] <xec> same goes for backgroundColor
[04:25:45] <xec> malydok: this is some homework assignment, isnt it?
[04:26:53] <malydok> xec, i took a small break from coding and totally forgot all the basics, sorry for the trouble, back to my homework
[04:29:33] <Braden`> jQuery('#searchContainer input[name="q"]').liveSearch({url: '/search-ajax/'}); <-- SCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method 'liveSearch'
[04:31:21] <xec> Braden`: what is liveSearch, some plugin?
[04:32:45] <Braden`> Yea
[04:33:03] <xec> is it included before that snippet is ran?
[04:33:10] <Braden`> Yep
[04:33:21] <xec> are you 100% sure?
[04:33:22] <Braden`> <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.liveSearch.js"></script>
[04:33:40] <Braden`> Its on the line before the <script> tag that handles the jquery statement
[04:33:48] <xec> is the url correct?
[04:34:05] <Braden`> I believe so.  I will double check by loading the js from the url
[04:35:12] <Braden`> Ah found the problem
[04:35:16] <Braden`> forgot a / before the js
[04:35:24] <xec> :)
[04:35:33] <Braden`> Thank you :)

[04:51:43] <dr0id> I think you should take a look at youtube.com and imgur.com before thinking about your technological stack again
[04:51:47] <jeffsmykil> dr0id: can you take a look at some code for me?
[04:51:56] <dr0id> yes
[04:52:14] <ryan00712> youtube?? for what?
[04:52:28] <jeffsmykil> dr0id: http://pastebin.com/GDZhXj8r
[04:52:53] <jeffsmykil> the last two functions close the slide out that haoppens, when i put prevent default in they dont close it but they also dont do the other action
[04:53:37] <frenocha> one of my hosting providers just responded to my question of "why is my mysql db timing out?" with "well, you shouldnt use mysql because it will make your website slow"
[04:53:43] <frenocha> promising answer, right?
[04:53:46] <ryan00712> what is the technology stack for imgur.com?
[04:54:14] <jeffsmykil> if im not mistaken imgur.com is run off leprechauns and unicorns
[04:54:32] <frenocha> jeffsmykil: not in the civilized world, after the No Unicorn Act of 2002
[04:54:52] <jeffsmykil> imgur is obviously hosted from the mooon frenocha
[04:55:12] <jeffsmykil> where NUA doesn't apply
[04:55:32] <frenocha> it's a dark, dark side, that moon
[04:56:03] <jeffsmykil> dr0id: does that make any sense?
[04:56:25] <dr0id> no
[04:56:27] <ryan00712> no it doesn't make any sense
[04:56:35] <dr0id> actually, testcases make more sense
[04:56:38] <ryan00712> I am asking honest question
[04:56:49] <ryan00712> please answer
[04:56:50] <jeffsmykil> dr0id: yeah I know
[04:57:14] <jeffsmykil> ryan00712: do your research the chances of us knowing that off the top of our heads is slim
[04:57:40] <halfh> jeffsmykil try .live('click',function(){}); instead of .click(function(){}); other then that, can't figure out without html
[04:57:43] <ryan00712> hmmm....
[04:57:44] <ryan00712> http://www.tutkiun.com/2011/07/web-technology-stack-analysis.html
[04:57:51] <dr0id> LAMP = LINUX APACHE MYSQL PHP = YOUR WEBSTACK
[04:58:01] <dr0id> Youtube is a video rich website and Imgur.com is an image rich website
[04:58:07] <jeffsmykil> thanks halfh
[04:58:12] <dr0id> so you are trying to do somehting that will fail in the next hour
[04:58:20] <ryan00712> I found this webpage explaining the technology architecture of some heavy content websites
[04:58:28] <ryan00712> http://www.tutkiun.com/2011/07/web-technology-stack-analysis.html
[04:58:44] <jeffsmykil> halfh: still disapears :/
[04:59:23] <ryan00712> But I didn't understand facebook uses php/js for frontend...
[04:59:31] <ryan00712> how come it uses C, C++ for backend
[04:59:38] <ryan00712> means php itself is a back end language
[04:59:40] <ryan00712> right?
[05:00:05] <ravenzz> no
[05:00:19] <ryan00712> :)
[05:00:20] <ryan00712> ?
[05:00:31] <ryan00712> can you explain a bit more
[05:01:14] <ravenzz> https://developers.facebook.com/opensource/
[05:01:21] <dr0id> there's a lolt of backend processing goin on
[05:01:28] <dr0id> that it uses c/c++, java, python for
[05:01:34] <dr0id> and erlang too, meh :/
[05:02:06] <frenocha> someone should tell Google and Facebook not to use MySQL, as it makes websites slow
[05:02:25] <dr0id> is that a joke ?
[05:02:28] <ryan00712> what database to use instead of MYSQL?
[05:02:43] <ravenzz> txt files
[05:02:47] <ravenzz> lol
[05:02:57] <ryan00712> :P
[05:02:58] <frenocha> dr0id: it's what my hosting provider told me 10 minutes ago
[05:03:05] <ravenzz> /lunch
[05:03:08] * frenocha is still a bit shocked
[05:03:17] <dr0id> tell them that they are good at joking
[05:03:19] <ryan00712> yup.... even i have heard this ..... MYSQL
[05:03:21] <ryan00712> is quite slow
[05:03:40] <frenocha> dr0id: it was in response to me asking why my mysql database was timing out ;(
[05:04:28] <dr0id> Dear Ryan, I can see you failing at developing any web app in the near future. kthxbai
[05:05:38] <ryan00712> actually I have been using MYSQL till now.... but I am analysing right now what other best solutions are available for use..
[05:06:05] <ryan00712> so reading up on new technologies
[05:06:05] <astropirate> fights on the interwebs!
[05:11:29] <manuell> hi
[05:12:52] <astropirate> does anyone else chuckle when they heear the word "webmaster"?
[05:13:30] <frenocha> I do prefer motu, myself ;)
[05:15:11] <troubleman> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/ptN4R/ - why do the first hovers unhide both of each row's product details? And how come that cycling code only works locally?
[05:15:14] <troubleman> If you wanna I can let you have my beach hut at Ambryn, French Polynesia (http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/ambryn/interesting/show/) for a month or so in return :-)
[05:22:51] <ajaxbud> Hello guys
[05:23:19] <ajaxbud> IS there a way to compare serialized object in a database with a string entered by user?
[05:24:04] <ajaxbud> for ex I have an array stored in the database after serializing it, nw I want to compare it with a string entered in one of the etxtboxes
[05:24:09] <ajaxbud> *textboxes
[05:24:15] <ajaxbud> How could this be done?
[05:24:21] <ajaxbud> ANybody out there?
[05:24:31] <manuell> hi, can anybody tell me, why this: http://jsfiddle.net/K2W3p/2/ works with firefox and chrome, but not with interexplorer ?
[05:25:38] <manuell> ajaxbud: load the array from your database, yourArray.join() == $('#yourtextbox').val()
[05:26:44] <Taloncor> I bind an resize event to an div (in this case  a jqueryui tab). Why isn't the event handler executed when i resize my window?
[05:27:12] <davetarmac> OK, this is starting to bug me now: http://www.pastie.org/3025996
[05:27:42] <davetarmac> For some reason, it isn't stopping at 110px, the animation is stopping at 6px
[05:28:12] <manuell> Taloncor: will your jqueryUi Tab also resize if you resize your window ?
[05:28:14] <ajaxbud> actually the array is serialized
[05:28:33] <Cork> manuell: without knowing what holdReady does, i would guess at the fact that ie doesn't have domReady
[05:28:36] <Cork> it uses .load
[05:28:41] <ajaxbud> I have to select the serialized object based on its comparision with a string in the SQL staement
[05:29:26] <ajaxbud> like say I have a country name in a string and a serialized array of countried in DB, I need to run a select statement using the string and return only those country values from the db
[05:29:40] <manuell> Cork: , holdready holds the ready event :) good for preloading things
[05:29:46] <Taloncor> manuell: Yes. The size changes. The event handler also isn't triggered when i change the tab (which will change the container height )
[05:29:55] <Cork> manuell: does it hold onload events too?
[05:30:04] <manuell> not sure..
[05:30:17] <Cork> that might be your problem
[05:30:36] <manuell> i think so, and i hope that is the problem, thank you
[05:32:01] <manuell> Taloncor: can you show me some code ?
[05:32:16] <ajaxbud> can the serialized object be used to write like statements in mysql?
[05:33:17] <manuell> ajaxbud: is your object serialized as xml ?
[05:33:32] <ajaxbud> no
[05:33:38] <Taloncor> manuell: I'll check if i can reproduce the problem with a minimalistic example
[05:33:40] <ajaxbud> I used the serialize method of PHP
[05:33:43] <davetarmac> OK, does anyone know any links that might help me animate something from the left or right of the screen stop it at a certain position?
[05:34:28] <manuell> Taloncor: good try :)
[05:34:42] <Cork> davetarmac: just set the element where you want to start it
[05:34:58] <Cork> davetarmac: then give animate() the top, left you want it to end at
[05:35:02] <Cork> nothing more to it
[05:35:04] <ajaxbud> select * from countries where country = 'Country_string'.. here country is an array of serialized objects
[05:35:08] <manuell> ajaxbud: sry, my php-fu is not the best
[05:35:19] <ajaxbud> no problem
[05:35:24] <Cork> ajaxbud: whats the question?
[05:35:27] <davetarmac> Cork: I'm trying to do it so that it follows the page scrolling :s
[05:35:40] <Cork> davetarmac: oh
[05:35:51] <davetarmac> Like the link I pasted: http://www.pastie.org/3025996
[05:35:54] <ajaxbud> I have an array stored in the database after serializing it, nw I want to compare it with a string entered in one of the etxtboxes
[05:35:58] <Cork> davetarmac: so take the document.scrollTop and set it in animate
[05:36:03] <Cork> soryr
[05:36:05] <Cork> *sorry
[05:36:11] <Cork> window.scrollTop
[05:36:16] <ajaxbud> cork I repasted the question
[05:36:46] <davetarmac> tried that, but no joy :(
[05:36:55] <Cork> ajaxbud: serializing data in strings isn't fun when you want to select on it
[05:37:07] <ajaxbud> oh..is thr any other way to do it?
[05:37:17] <Cork> ajaxbud: separat columns
[05:37:45] <davetarmac> Cork: the actual animation is fine - the problem I have it it is stopping in the wrong place. I've asked it to stop at 110px but it stops at 6px
[05:37:49] <ajaxbud> separata columns for every country?I'm afraid that wouldn;t work out for me
[05:37:58] <davetarmac> Is this related to the size of the view port by any chance?
[05:38:41] <Cork> ajaxbud: uh... no
[05:38:56] <Cork> ajaxbud: if you have several countrys per row you have a separat connection table
[05:39:40] <Cork> ajaxbud: tabel1 => table1_to_countries [table1_id, country_id] => countries
[05:40:08] <Cork> ajaxbud: thats how you normally solve it in relational databases
[05:41:14] <Chetic> is it possible to make a custom tag in valid xhtml?
[05:41:41] <Cork> no
[05:41:49] <Chetic> thank you
[05:41:54] <Cork> not in valid any *html*
[05:42:06] <Cork> only xml
[05:42:11] <ajaxbud> oh thanks cork
[05:42:20] <ajaxbud> but I guess I figured it out anyway
[05:42:25] <varnie> hi
[05:42:46] <ajaxbud> using %%country_name"" works on serialized objects
[05:43:34] <varnie> I am newbie and I am sure I made some simple mistake but I cannot figure it out; the json query returns "error": http://pastebin.com/7Kyu6ywZ
[05:43:42] <varnie> what am I doing incorrectly?
[05:44:08] <manuell> can andybody tell me whats the different between (document).ready and (window).load ?
[05:45:26] <Taloncor> manuell: window.load waits until everything is fully loaded (iframes, images, etc.)
[05:45:36] <Taloncor> document.ready just waits for the dom tree to be complete
[05:45:44] <Cork> manuell: dom ready is triggered when the dom has stabilized and you can safly traverse it
[05:46:00] <Cork> manuell: .load means all content needed for the page to be complete is loaded
[05:46:01] <manuell> okay, thx
[05:46:19] <Cork> or rather the "throbber" has stopped
[05:46:26] <manuell> Cork: also async loaded js ?
[05:46:30] <Cork> no
[05:46:44] <Cork> thats why i changed my defenition :)
[05:47:22] <manuell> i spend more time to fix my app for internet explorer then development
[05:51:04] <varnie> okay, I fixed the mistake;)
[05:59:42] <manuell> Cork: now my event order is correct,.. but ajax.js ( http://jsfiddle.net/K2W3p/2/ ) wont work with IE,.. any further ideas ?
[06:00:03] <manuell> if ajax.js is empty it will load
[06:02:29] <edgardo_> manuell, you have it on mootools on purpose?
[06:03:59] <manuell> edgardo_: no
[06:10:27] <manuell> waaaaaa
[06:11:08] <manuell> iCore.data.ajax=(function..... will not work with IE, but iCoreDataAjax=(function... will
[06:11:15] <troubleman> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/ptN4R/ - why do the first hovers unhide both of each row's product details? And how come that cycling code only works locally?
[06:11:18] <troubleman> If you wanna I can let you have my beach hut at Ambryn, French Polynesia (http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/ambryn/interesting/show/) for a month or so in return :-)
[06:13:01] <Krhome> Hi
[06:13:29] <Krhome> I need some help about jquery
[06:14:07] <Krhome> I've a form with a submit button, and it's work on all browser, except IE7
[06:15:15] <Krhome> I've specify the type"submit" in the button as it's said on jquery forum but it's still doesnt work
[06:15:27] <Krhome> Do you have any idea, for how correct it?
[06:17:01] <maitre_kaio> Khrome: give us a fiddle to see your code
[06:17:07] <manuell> Krhome: can you show ...
[06:23:39] <zyltoid> is there a nice fast jquery drag pluggin, that isn't plugged into the ui library?
[06:27:55] <astropirate> zyltoid, you can make your own very easily
[06:27:55] <Krhome> here is the code:
[06:27:56] <Krhome> http://www.demovisiolink.com/Web/fr-FR/Account/LogOn
[06:28:16] <kborchers> zyltoid: any reason why you won't use UI Draggable?
[06:28:17] <Krhome> if you click on "Doctor Access"
[06:28:41] <Krhome> you will have a submit form
[06:28:46] <troubleman> In $(".products li").hoverIntent({ - how do I define multiple classes?
[06:28:51] <Krhome> this submit form doesn't work on IE7
[06:29:06] <troubleman> At $(".products li").hoverIntent({ - how do I define multiple classes? Say I want it to work for "#banners li li" as well?
[06:29:53] <Cork> troubleman: separate them with commas
[06:30:34] <troubleman> really, its that simple?
[06:30:39] <Cork> yes
[06:30:55] <troubleman> good lord so it is!
[06:30:56] <Cork> troubleman: the same way you write css
[06:31:01] <troubleman> thanks man!
[06:31:03] <troubleman> :D
[06:31:50] <zyltoid> kborchers: it was adding the ui classes to my elements. though I found out it has an option to disable that, so all is well now
[06:32:17] <zyltoid> it was also going crazy if i scrolled past the window size, but that was also fixed with an option
[06:34:04] <rahmen> Hi! I've got a div with contenteditable="true". The div contains a paragraph from the beginning. When I press ctrl+a and remove everthing even the paragraph gets removed. So when I start typing again it's inside the div. I want it to create a paragraph also.. anyone have any experience of this?
[06:34:51] <manuell> have anybody build a preloader for a complete site that works in all browsers ? i think my concept is wrong
[06:35:00] <zyltoid> hmm, it's still adding a class while dragging :(
[06:38:52] <varnie> when I try to parse JSON response firebug shows me "Invalid label". how do I fix that?
[06:39:45] <dr0id> by using chrome developer tools
[06:40:26] <SoulRaven> if i have e.preventDefault on some actions
[06:40:35] <SoulRaven> how i disable prevent default for that action?
[06:41:28] <xec> remove the e.preventDefault for those "actions"?
[06:41:32] <mattyh88> hi, i have an autocomplete textbox field .. but when I choose one of the options, the value in the textfield shows the full label like in autocompleter. can i only have the first part in the textfield?
[06:41:39] <dr0id> :P
[06:41:52] <mattyh88> the autocomplete has something like this "AAA (123)" i only want the AAA bit to display in the textfield
[06:42:53] <SoulRaven> but how....because i have this construct, click action on submit form, initial prevent default, the analize the forms element, if all the elements are ok, then remove prevent default
[06:43:20] <xec> ?demo @ SoulRaven
[06:43:32] <xec> where is bot-t when you need him
[06:43:44] <xec> SoulRaven: can you show us your code? preferable in a working demo
[06:43:49] <xec> preferably*
[06:44:31] <SoulRaven> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/M2r3Q/
[06:44:35] <cedeon> hi all
[06:44:47] <SoulRaven> working demo i don't have because i framework dependent
[06:45:05] <cedeon> im trying to bind an event to a css background image load.. is this possible?
[06:45:36] <xec> SoulRaven: what if you move the e.preventDefault to the else block (i.e. only prevent if the check fails=
[06:45:40] <xec> )*
[06:45:54] <SoulRaven> is not working, i have try
[06:46:12] <SoulRaven> and submit the form, before to arive in if statment
[06:47:22] <xec> hm, ok. what if you try to listen to $(theform).submit() instead?
[06:49:23] <mattyh88> hi, is it possible for an autocomplete field to only display the first bit of an option from the autocompleter
[06:49:23] <mattyh88> i.e. if the autocompleter show "AAA (123)" I could only have the "AAA" bit in my textfield?
[06:50:30] <varnie> now I have "Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type application/json."
[06:50:42] <varnie> is that the server which sends wrong MIME type?
[06:50:48] <xec> SoulRaven: http://jsfiddle.net/M2r3Q/1/
[06:53:02] <varnie> the server sends me "Content-Type:application/json" in the headers
[06:57:26] <nFFF> is there anyway to find an element
[06:57:29] <nFFF> and place code before it?
[06:57:50] <Biomech> yes
[06:58:20] <Biomech> http://api.jquery.com/insertBefore/
[06:58:36] <jcrawford> guys something like this *should* work right? $("#fanPageBtn, #likeFanPageLink").click(function(e) { // do stuff });
[06:58:56] <dr0id> yes, but in jquery only
[06:59:08] <jcrawford> right, odd it's not working for my second id selector :(
[06:59:11] <jcrawford> works for the first though
[06:59:27] <dr0id> maybe you need on, delegate or live
[06:59:54] <Ankabout> Hi, I have a background image using background-size: cover;    and on the same page I have a jquery animation, but that's jumpy because the page size changes when it animates
[06:59:56] <Ankabout> how can I avoid that?
[07:00:05] <cedeon> jcrawford: thats not gonna give you both objs
[07:00:23] <cedeon> jcrawford: imagine if you wrote that in css
[07:00:27] <jcrawford> basically if you click on either I want the code to execute
[07:00:34] <cedeon> it would be saying find the id thats inside the id
[07:00:51] <cedeon> same thing applies
[07:00:52] <jcrawford> cedeon: i thought the , seperated them and #element #element2 would say find the one inside element
[07:01:12] <nFFF> Biomech, thank
[07:01:13] <nFFF> s
[07:01:29] <Biomech> np, just dont ask me how to use it because I know 0 js/jq :P
[07:01:56] <cedeon> yes its saying find #id thats inside #id.. but you may aswell just say the last #id as they are unique anyway
[07:02:11] <Leka> Hi, i'm trying some basic .show .hide functions for div elements. any idea why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/whps8/1/
[07:03:07] <jcrawford> cedeon: im confused now :D
[07:03:42] <jcrawford> this: http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/ says I am correct?
[07:04:12] <cedeon> jcrawford: i think i confused myself, lol nvm
[07:04:15] <jcrawford> .live("click" function(e) { }); didn't work either :D
[07:05:08] <Ungy> does anyone know when the plugins site will be back up and running?
[07:05:13] <cedeon> maybe you are using the id twice or something?
[07:06:03] <cedeon> could try giving them an equal class instead
[07:06:54] <Ungy> I need a plugin for light box effects like domwindow but domwindow doesn't work with 1.7.1 I keep getting that damned name.replace is not a function bug
[07:08:58] <Burgov> hi
[07:09:18] <Burgov> in a .ajaxSuccess handler, how can I see the contenttype header of the response?
[07:09:59] <thinkt4nk> Leka, see your call to hide()
[07:10:20] <thinkt4nk> you're getting an error about illegal character, because you've accidentally replaced $ with #
[07:10:23] <Ungy> Burgov I just use firebug and use the console tab and check the headers
[07:11:15] <thinkt4nk> you'll also need to select jquery framework to load from the selection to the left
[07:11:18] <Burgov> Ungy: i mean programatically. I need to know whether the response is json or something else... but actually i just found the xhr.getResponseHeader method so i got it already
[07:20:54] <shwaiil> hi guys
[07:21:00] <Leka> i'm trying to have the same .show .hide jquery script, for several div elements. how do i approach this? my version doesn't work for more than the first http://jsfiddle.net/xtfZC/
[07:21:06] <jeffsmykil> how would I go about doing this?  	$(document).not(".searchPanelWrapper").bind('click', function() {
[07:21:07] <jeffsmykil> 		hideSearchPanel();
[07:21:07] <jeffsmykil> 	});
[07:22:41] <Taloncor> Leka: You should not assign the same id for multiple elements. That will break stuff ;)
[07:23:48] <Leka> Taloncor: hmm, but is there any way to make several different ID'd elements and still use the same script for them?, like $("div").next("div") or something?
[07:24:27] <Taloncor> Leka: Do you want one button to show/hide them all? Or a button for each div?
[07:24:54] <Leka> Taloncor: 1 button for each div, but they should always open the sub-div (a div within that div) for each one
[07:25:38] <jeffsmykil> if i click on anything but this and its children
[07:25:41] <jeffsmykil> how do I say that?
[07:27:17] <Charliemo> hi everyone having a bit of an issue making this work with Drupal
[07:27:24] <Charliemo> don't know where to put stuff
[07:27:29] <X0Rc0re> http://tinychat.com/hacktheplanet
[07:27:45] <Charliemo> don't hink i need to put stuff in headers calling jquery as is preloaded

[07:28:19] <Charliemo> but have some code I found online to try and reuse and having problems placing it
[07:29:32] <roowilliams> i have a hover function scolling a div across another element and then scrolling it off in the same direction, the problem is, once it's completed the animation the first time it wont reset because it's over the wrong side of the div
[07:29:44] <Leka> Taloncor: oh, thanks man! possible stupid question: it's OK to use the same class on various elements, but ID's shoulda always stay unique? :) i suppose it's self explanatory
[07:29:46] <roowilliams> does anyone know how i can reset the animation after it completes?
[07:30:34] <emx> i can't find a function that submits a form. is there one?
[07:30:43] <roowilliams> here is my code: http://pastebin.com/zdcxC244
[07:31:09] <roowilliams> i would like it to reset without the animation
[07:31:12] <Taloncor> Leka: Exactly :)
[07:34:17] <quicksilver> emx: .submit() amazingly enough
[07:34:35] <quicksilver> emx: http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[07:34:53] <quicksilver> emx: which is the top google hit for 'jquery submit form' :P
[07:35:19] <detha> small annoyance on jstree: if I bind a function to select_node, and select a leaf node, the first click on the + of its parent to collapse the tree selects the parent, instead of collapsing it. second click collapses it as intended. any way to make this work with one click?
[07:35:21] <emx> quicksilver, i found it, but i just read "bind an event handler
[07:35:29] <emx> didn't realise it also triggers
[07:35:35] <emx> thanks
[07:36:15] <quicksilver> :)
[07:44:44] <jeffsmykil> $(e.target).parents().is('.searchPanelWrapper')
[07:44:52] <jeffsmykil> quicksilver: does that say what i think it does?
[07:46:25] <jeffsmykil> that element has a parent that is that element class?
[07:47:59] <aleray> hi, I have a script that returns me the following content that I inject in my page: http://dpaste.com/674267/
[07:48:13] <aleray> however the script doesn't get executed
[07:48:32] <aleray> it works if I paste the content of the js in my console
[07:48:39] <Taloncor> jeffsmykil: That returns true if one of the parents of $(e.target) has the class searchPanelWrapper
[07:48:47] <aleray> could you tell me how to fix it?
[07:49:33] <sphinxxx> aleray why do you have all those backslash escapes
[07:50:05] <jeffsmykil> Taloncor: including elements with a class of undefined>
[07:50:42] <Leka> is there any way to change class to an element? it seems it would look better than this .show .hide to my button: http://jsfiddle.net/xtfZC/7/
[07:51:04] <Leka> it just spasms :D
[07:51:19] <aleray> sphinxxx, I copied it from the json response
[07:51:25] <aleray> in the chromium console
[07:51:47] <aleray> sphinxxx, interesting, chromium doesn't seem to inject the script tag
[07:51:52] <aleray> the rest yes
[07:56:22] <roowilliams> http://roowilliams.dyndns.org/siri/press/ any way i can reset these animations after they have complete?
[07:58:51] <Ungy> Can I use jQuery dialog for a hover event?
[07:59:32] <guynamedkeith> like open a dialog when you hover?
[07:59:48] <Ungy> yes
[07:59:54] <guynamedkeith> yes you can
[08:00:10] <Ungy> or just display a dialoge and remove it on mouseout
[08:00:29] <Ungy> somethign like this jQuery('#nickname_link').hover( function () { jQuery('#nickname').dialog("open");},  function () { jQuery('#nickname').dialog("destroy"); });
[08:00:34] <guynamedkeith> add event listeners for mouse in and mouse out
[08:00:47] <dmsuperman> How might I accomplish an animated move, where I take a node, .appendTo on another node, and have that be animated?
[08:00:51] <dmsuperman> I want it to slide into position
[08:00:52] <Ungy> But that doesn't work at all
[08:00:54] <guynamedkeith> it's dialog.("close") i think
[08:01:05] <dmsuperman> $(dialog).dialog('close')
[08:01:29] <roowilliams> http://roowilliams.dyndns.org/siri/press/ any way i can reset these animations after they have complete?
[08:02:19] <roowilliams> reset without animation that is
[08:02:32] <Ungy> hmm jQuery('#nickname_link').hover( function () { jQuery('#nickname').dialog("open");},  function () { jQuery('#nickname').dialog("close"); }); does absolutly nothing I think I am missing a step
[08:03:34] <guynamedkeith> do you have html for the dialog element?
[08:04:45] <guynamedkeith> Ungy: I am working on a fiddle for you
[08:05:37] <frenocha> yay, 1000 lines
[08:05:40] <Ungy> <div id="nickname" style="display: none;"><p>Explaining to the customer what the &ldquo;Nickname&rdquo; field is used for and why it is a required field as part of their shipping address.</p></div>
[08:06:23] <guynamedkeith> Ungy: http://jsfiddle.net/ttMf5/7/
[08:06:30] <guynamedkeith> that works
[08:07:21] <Ungy> ah ok thanks I missed the jQuery( "#nickname" ).dialog();
[08:09:58] <shwaiil> Q: How to access a object index using a var data ? For example if myVar = myIndex, how could I access it in the obj context ? something like myObj.myVar. Any tips are appreciated! thanks a lot for looking
[08:10:34] <Ungy> in an object it woudl be this.myVar
[08:10:46] <Ungy> but you need ot make sure your in the correct context
[08:10:56] <Ungy> if your outside of the object it woudl be Object.myVar
[08:11:38] <shwaiil> Ungy, tks for looking
[08:11:47] <shwaiil> I'm getting a error when trying to obj.myVar
[08:11:54] <Ungy> be careful though since sometimes you checge context without realizing it. I often use parentThis = this when entering a function as it makes sure I can reference the correct context
[08:11:59] <shwaiil> because myVar is a object like myVar.myIndex.someOther = somedata
[08:12:01] <shwaiil> :T
[08:12:24] <shwaiil> so when trying myObj.myVar.myIndex.sometOher
[08:12:27] <shwaiil> I get a xml filter error
[08:13:04] <dmsuperman> shwaiil: I write my statements like this: if(myObj && myObj.myVar && myObj.myVar.myIndex)
[08:13:11] <dmsuperman> to account for faulty/inconsistent data
[08:13:28] <dmsuperman> shwaiil: Also if(myObj.constructor instanceof OBject)
[08:13:50] <Ungy> I often use typeof myObj == 'object' as well
[08:14:18] <shwaiil> I see
[08:14:21] <Ungy> dmsuperman hmm I like that
[08:14:27] <Ungy> I might steal that
[08:15:06] <dmsuperman> Ungy: The problem with that is typeof new Date() == 'object'
[08:15:18] <dmsuperman> also arrays
[08:16:03] <dmsuperman> so if you're trying to iterate the properties your check isn't useful. I believe o.constructor instanceof Object will only match normalized hashes
[08:17:16] <Ungy> dmsuperman that is why I said I liked it I might use that for objects and my way for functions strings and the like
[08:17:35] <Ungy> but it is better then not checking
[08:18:44] <Mookman288> Hi. I'm working on a megamenu and I'm having difficulties with hovering behavior. When quickly moving between links, sometimes the div designed to hover either 1.) slides up/down repeatedly, 2.) never slides up, 3.) never "resets" fully. See: http://jsfiddle.net/dsSbd/2/

[08:20:23] <Merimac> some one know how change I detect the end of an animation wich is depending to a select ?
[08:20:29] <NoiseEee> shwaiil: of course
[08:20:40] <shwaiil> NoiseEee: tks for looking
[08:20:44] <NoiseEee> shwaiil: what are you trying to do /expect?
[08:20:55] <shwaiil> NoiseEee: I want to access a object by using a index name
[08:21:07] <NoiseEee> shwaiil: myObj[myVar]
[08:21:08] <shwaiil> that I get from a node element , such as text data
[08:21:15] <shwaiil> NoiseEee:  I'll try :D
[08:21:32] <shwaiil> NoiseEee: works just fine :D thanks a lot
[08:21:40] <Merimac> exemple: I change a select, this toogle a div,
[08:21:50] <NoiseEee> shwaiil: np
[08:22:20] <Merimac> I want to get the height of all after the toggle
[08:24:40] <Mookman288> Merimac: call back function?
[08:25:21] <Merimac> I can do a callback cause it a shared code
[08:25:42] <Merimac> *cant'
[08:26:05] <Merimac> and I cant modify the function which toggle my div
[08:27:31] <dmsuperman> shwaiil: you want myObj[myVar]
[08:27:40] <shwaiil> dmsuperman: thanks
[08:27:52] <dmsuperman> shwaiil: o.a is just a shortcut for o["a"]
[08:27:59] <dmsuperman> er, that's backward
[08:28:09] <shwaiil> I see :)

[08:29:43] <Mookman288> Merimac: A makeshift listener function using setInterval?
[08:29:44] <bartek> Hi there. I have a really large block of html code that I need to add to my DOM. Simply doing $("#some-div").append(html) is kind of slow when it's huge. Are there better ways to do this? And yes, parsing a huge HTML blob is nasty, but it's gotta be done at this point :^\
[08:29:44] <jeffsmykil> but with  $(e.target).parents()[1] i get something
[08:29:50] <Mookman288> Merimac: probably not at all efficient.
[08:30:08] <Ungy> damn this name.replace is not a function bug is really god damn annoying
[08:30:39] <NoiseEee> bartek: if its gotta be done at this point, thats the way its goign to be done.  (kinda slow)
[08:30:59] <Merimac> Mookman288 yes I can try this way
[08:31:08] <bartek> NoiseEee: Nothing I can do about chunking it or anything?
[08:31:12] <NoiseEee> bartek: you can see if working with a dom fragment helps  (ie: append everything to the fragment)
[08:31:38] <bartek> I read Resigs post about that, but I wanted to make sure that wasn't already built into jquery for performance purposes
[08:31:40] <Merimac> .queue cant be used to check if I have action progressing ?
[08:31:55] <bartek> NoiseEee: Will give it a re-look, thank you
[08:32:04] <NoiseEee> bartek: np good luck
[08:32:16] <Ungy> if it has to be a function why not just test for a freaking function
[08:34:24] <orentanay> I was checkingt out the Google phone on Google's site, and came accross this great 3d solution, http://www.google.com/nexus/#/tech-specs Anyone know if this is dependent on flash?
[08:35:25] <NoiseEee> orentanay: its not flash
[08:35:37] <orentanay> wow, now I'm really interested.
[08:35:54] <jeffsmykil> yeah its just a ton of images
[08:36:02] <jeffsmykil> being shown in hidden in progression
[08:36:24] <orentanay> holly crap, i thought it was slicker than that.
[08:36:48] <NoiseEee> yeah its pretty slick
[08:36:53] <jeffsmykil> well that's my guess after looking at code for 4 seconds

[08:38:15] <Raydiation> line 47
[08:38:33] <bjensen> Can you guys recommend a plugin for uploading files using ajax?
[08:39:29] <quicksilver> orentanay: jeff is wrong.
[08:39:45] <quicksilver> orentanay: it's webGl if your browser supports it (if you can do full roration, it's webGL)
[08:39:56] <quicksilver> the "switch to classic for older browsers" is just a bunch of static images
[08:40:16] <quicksilver> but that only supports straight rotation in set planes
[08:42:27] <orentanay> I just noticed the webGL stuff, another new concept for me to wrap my head around.
[08:42:32] <NoiseEee> quicksilver: does a good job of that though, i don't have webGL
[08:42:36] <Raydiation> had to put it outside document ready function
[08:42:53] <orentanay> But what a great product visualizing tool.
[08:51:45] <Ungy> OK what the hell when I add jQuery(#nickname').dialog(); inside a document.ready I get a name.replace is not a function
[08:53:09] <wtfizzle> What version of jQuery and jQuery UI are you using?
[08:53:41] <Ungy> jQuery 1.7.1 and jQuery ui 1.8.16
[08:53:42] <KodeKamel> missing '
[08:53:44] <Merimac> Mookman288 I used setInterval
[08:53:54] <Merimac> I have no other choice!
[08:54:00] <Merimac> thanks for help
[08:54:09] <Mookman288> Merimac: Good luck, hope there's no adverse effects
[08:55:05] <Ungy> guess I will drop to 1.6.2 and try again
[08:55:21] <wtfizzle> Yea, my guess is incompatible versions
[08:55:58] <Ungy> that bug comes up nearly every time they chagne a version
[08:56:10] <Ungy> why not trap for it if it is so damn common
[08:56:56] <Mookman288> KodeKamel: Hah, I didn't even notice that. Good eye.
[08:57:27] <Ungy> nope still happens holy crap what is going on with this thing
[08:57:56] <wtfizzle> Yea, I just tried it in jsfiddle and didn't see any errors
[08:57:58] <frazras> I am confused?!?!?!?!? The test JSON code and url on their website  works but no other JSON feed seems to work: the example on the jquery site is  	$.getJSON("http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?jsoncallback=?&format=json", function() {alert('hey');});
[08:58:12] <frazras> any other URL $.getJSON("http://yourblog.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=json-in-script&callback=showfeedcontent", function() {alert('hey');});
[08:58:16] <frazras> does not work
[08:58:19] <wtfizzle> I think you'd have to give more context
[08:58:58] <frazras> try substituting any other JSOn feed and it deosnt trigger the alret
[09:04:42] <shwaiil> Q: when using .fadeIn() or fadeOut(), jquery sets inner style. whats the best way to check if item is visible or not ? .attr() ? I guess css() wont work here right ? any tips ? thanks
[09:04:48] <KodeKamel> Mookman288:  haha
[09:05:09] <Mookman288> Ungy: Just confirming you fixed KodeKamel's ' catch, right?
[09:06:19] <wtfizzle> shwaiil: I've always just checked the css properties with .css.  But something you might want to consider is sticking to the .animate() function for animations.  It makes it a lot easier to track the exact style changes you want.
[09:06:36] <shwaiil> wtfizzle: tks for looking. I see
[09:06:53] <shwaiil> for this case, where jquery sets inner style, can I still use .css() I've done some TIAS and it seems it doesnt work
[09:07:00] <shwaiil> so I'm thinking about going with .attr()
[09:07:05] <wtfizzle> That's more personal preference than anything else, but I've found it much easier to keep track of what's going on
[09:07:15] <NoiseEee> shwaiil: $(el).is(":visible")
[09:07:48] <shwaiil> NoiseEee: oh tks :)
[09:08:12] <aleray> how can I check if an dom element created via a script is ready?
[09:08:20] <aleray> ready() seems buggy....
[09:08:30] <aleray> I tried $(elt).ready()
[09:08:36] <NoiseEee> what does 'ready' mean to you aleray?
[09:10:52] <necromancer> .ready() is just for document, not DOM elements. unfortunately, you can't detect when an element is "ready".
[09:11:59] <necromancer> a DOM Element created via a script is always "ready", meaning you can insert it into the page at any time
[09:14:12] <Ungy> Mookman yeah that was not an actual bug I just typed it incorrectly
[09:14:28] <Mookman288> Oh okay
[09:14:33] <Mookman288> You never know!
[09:19:05] <devOlsen> cool! http://tinyurl.com/6qp7klv
[09:20:35] <bartmax> desearialize a URL query string in a data attribute of ajax object ?
[09:21:31] <aleray> necromancer: I want to create an element and inject/evalutate a script just after that and take the element just created into account
[09:21:34] <aleray> any idea ?
[09:21:34] <Milos> How do I pass [something] in .click(function(e, [something]))
[09:21:45] <aleray> so far I'm using settimeout... no so nice
[09:22:51] <necromancer> Milos: what's [something]?
[09:23:03] <necromancer> and i'm pretty sure no, you can't. click callbacks take 1 arg
[09:23:07] <Milos> necolas, a variable with one value in it. But that value changes in the for loop.
[09:23:21] <necromancer> but you can define [something] in the scope above your .click callback, and it will be available in the callback
[09:23:42] <Milos> Yeah, and in the for loop it's the last value.
[09:23:58] <Milos> Because by the time the function is called back, the for loop has ended.
[09:24:07] <necromancer> aleray: so this is a 3 step process. create the element, then create the <script> tag using document.createElement(), then you append both to the DOM
[09:24:11] <Milos> See my problem?
[09:24:22] <bartmax> i have user_id=342&source=abc&ismain=true .. how can i deserialize into a object so I can get for example, obj.source ?
[09:24:33] <aleray> necromancer, I tried that... no succes
[09:24:39] <aleray> necromancer, I tried that... no success
[09:24:42] <aleray> oups
[09:25:10] <necromancer> Milos: nope. you're probably gonna have to jsfiddle it
[09:25:45] <necromancer> aleray: does the script not get executed?
[09:26:55] <aleray> it gets, but I get an error: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'lightBox'
[09:26:56] <necromancer> aleray: try document.createElement() rather than $('<script />')
[09:27:03] <aleray> necromancer, ok
[09:27:10] <necromancer> aleray: i have a feeling you're doing it wrong. mind jsfiddling it?
[09:28:53] <Milos> necolas, sorted using $(this).bind('click', {item: item}, function(e) {
[09:29:00] <Milos> e.data.item gives the value
[09:29:10] <NoiseEee> aleray: i'd bet the problem has nothing to do with your new element, but with you not waiting for your new/injected script to load before running a function in it
[09:29:13] <aleray> necromancer, thxs, just a moment
[09:29:20] <Milos> isntead of $(this).click(function(e)) { }
[09:29:24] <Milos> s/isn/ins/
[09:29:32] <Milos> oops not necolas, I meant necromancer.
[09:33:53] <winux> I have a class on several different items, how do i go about selecting an arbitrary item based on the class, is it even possible?
[09:34:48] <Mookman288> Does it have to be arbitrary?
[09:35:28] <Mookman288> One of the first results: http://blog.mastykarz.nl/jquery-random-filter/ <-- you would do .class:random
[09:35:44] <aleray> NoiseEee, necromancer http://jsfiddle.net/zTMRf/
[09:35:49] <winux> Mookman288: yes, i need to be able to have the ability to specify one
[09:35:52] <wtfizzle> Milos:  Bit delated, but did you find a solution yet?  Your issue happens to be an interview question I ask, lol
[09:35:55] <wtfizzle> delayed*
[09:36:06] <Milos> wtfizzle, yeah I answered it
[09:36:10] <Milos> sorted using $(this).bind('click', {item: item}, function(e) {
[09:36:12] <winux> Mookman288: basically, if a user clicks the one item out of multiple, i need only the jQuery to affect that item
[09:36:13] <Mookman288> winux: Arbitrary = on a whim/random
[09:36:18] <Milos> wtfizzle, e.data.item gives the value
[09:36:21] <winux> Mookman288: bad choice of words
[09:36:23] <winux> unique
[09:36:37] <Mookman288> jQuery('.class').click(function() { jquery(this).dostuff });
[09:36:38] <wtfizzle> Ah, ok
[09:36:50] <Milos> wtfizzle, what do you mean by interview question if I may ask
[09:36:52] <winux> Mookman288: will try it!
[09:37:04] <Mookman288> winux: jsfiddle it if you have issues

[09:54:07] <JonathanCutrell_> Hello folksâ€¦ I've got an interesting issue with a plugin I'm creating. Who might have a few minutes to help out?
[09:54:12] <Eviltwin> quackquack: Well it's not faster, that's for sure
[09:54:33] <quackquack> k, thx
[09:54:36] <Eviltwin> However it can do things that .innerHTML alone cannot
[09:54:51] <Eviltwin> Like also execute scripts in there
[09:55:20] <Eviltwin> Or replaceWith an existing DOM element that has event listeners and what not bound to it
[09:57:07] <Mookman288> JonathanCutrell_: â™¥ Just ask! No PMs, plz. â™¥
[09:57:58] <fission6> i want to time the time from when a button is clicked until it is clicked again, how can id o thiat?
[09:58:00] <fission6> this
[09:58:44] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: Okiedoke - so it's a slider plugin I'm working on just for internal use at a company I work for.
[09:58:49] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: http://pastie.org/3027464
[09:59:13] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288 (there's two plugins there actually, but this one's called wbSlider)
[09:59:51] <Mookman288> JonathanCutrell_: You need to post the issue, heh.
[09:59:55] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: the problem I'm having is this: I'm calling two sliders. One is dependent on the other. I'm trying to make everything based on triggering events.
[10:00:16] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288 I'll post the calling code - one sec
[10:00:57] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: http://pastie.org/3027475
[10:01:25] <fission6> any ideas on how to time something?
[10:01:33] <JonathanCutrell_> so essentially, one slider is triggered by the other through events triggered on the containing element.
[10:01:35] <Rembane> fission6: Time how?
[10:01:43] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: /\
[10:01:51] <takahiro> anyone know how to change how the height of a jquery dialog box is calculated? its chopping off the text in the dialog box
[10:01:54] <JonathanCutrell_> fission6: Probably looking for a timeout.
[10:02:11] <JonathanCutrell_> takahiro: you mean a jQuery Mobile dialog?
[10:02:15] <Rembane> fission6: I mean, for what purpose?
[10:02:31] <fission6> i want to find the total time between user clicks of a certain button
[10:02:36] <fission6> and record that up to a webservice
[10:02:42] <takahiro> no, jquery ui dialog
[10:02:48] <Eviltwin> fission6: var start = +new Date; ... var end = +new Date;
[10:02:51] <fission6> i found thi ssimple get time http://www.davekb.com/browse_programming_tips:javascript_time_the_duration_of_something:txt
[10:02:55] <Eviltwin> var seconds = (end-start)/1000;
[10:03:07] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: So the problem is a call stack overflow.
[10:03:09] <muralex> !list
[10:03:17] <fission6> whats start = +new Date;
[10:03:33] <Eviltwin> fission6: Shorthand for (new Date).getTime();
[10:03:41] <Mookman288> JonathanCutrell_: It may be easier to see it in action, do you have a page or a fiddle of this?
[10:03:52] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: sure do - mind if I pm it to you?
[10:04:00] <Mookman288> JonathanCutrell_: Okay.
[10:04:06] <Whirl3d> Good morning all. Anybody use XRegExp with Jquery 1.7?
[10:04:25] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: sent
[10:04:36] <fission6> thats not legit syntax though is it Eviltwin
[10:05:54] <fission6> Eviltwin: like i ma no tmissing some handed syntax?
[10:06:19] <takahiro> nevermind, the .dialog() has a "height" option
[10:07:25] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: does that error make sense? Is it something lower level than I'm realizing?
[10:07:46] <Mookman288> It makes sense in that there is something like an infinite loop being called
[10:07:47] <fission6> oh wait you can literall do start = +new Date; what is that syntax called?
[10:08:04] <Mookman288> It's occuring in jQuery during handler events/animation I believe
[10:08:56] <Mookman288> I was wondering if you had debugged it to the exact line causing the issue.
[10:11:23] <fission6> Eviltwin: any insight?
[10:12:23] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: it's happening in the wbSlide.eventHandle function in the plugin
[10:13:01] <Mookman288> Which traces back to the actual animation?
[10:13:22] <Eviltwin> fission6: Insight?
[10:13:29] <Eviltwin> ?eval +new Date
[10:13:32] <bot-t> Eviltwin: 1324059195661
[10:13:36] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: well I think it's the events that are somehow being triggered multiple times.
[10:14:29] <Mookman288> JonathanCutrell_: Yes, but exactly where it's being triggered infinitely is important--unless it is within the function itself (hence where does it trace to)
[10:14:49] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: that's what I'm trying to figure out. :)
[10:15:01] <fission6> oh i mean what is it called to do var something =  +new date, i have never seen the +new
[10:15:04] <winux> Is there a valid way to do this: $(this).(".someClass").animate ?
[10:15:06] <fission6> Eviltwin: ^
[10:15:25] <Eviltwin> fission6: It has to do with the way the operators work in JavaScript
[10:15:28] <Mookman288> No, I know that, but what I'm saying is: looking at the code isn't going to just immediately show what's causing this issue; I believe the error is being truthful in what's happening.
[10:15:51] <fission6> ok, so just doing var = new Date(); is reasonable
[10:16:04] <Eviltwin> Yes however if you want to know the elapsed time
[10:16:14] <Eviltwin> You need to do .getTime() on both vars and subtrack
[10:16:17] <Eviltwin> subtract*
[10:16:19] <Mookman288> i.e. nextslide/prevslide
[10:16:37] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: well it's definitely happening in nextslide
[10:16:50] <Mookman288> Are you able to cut out code to debug the exact moment it occurs?
[10:17:24] <fission6> oh Eviltwin yeah i have i working very nicely, thank you
[10:17:48] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: putting in logging statements now.
[10:19:43] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: looks like it is happening at wbSlide.slider.trigger("wbSlideNextStart"); (line 129)
[10:21:59] <Mookman288> JonathanCutrell_: Is there a function tied to that? I'm not seeing it.
[10:22:37] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: It's so it can be watched externally. So in my script file, I can say $(el).on("wbSlideNextStart", function(){ // do something });
[10:23:18] <Mookman288> JonathanCutrell_: And if you remove this line, the application functions correctly?
[10:23:22] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: in this case, I am triggering slideControlNext on the other slider.
[10:23:27] <Mookman288> Ah
[10:23:37] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: make sense?
[10:23:54] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: if you remove it, you can't watch for the event on the outside.
[10:24:13] <Mookman288> JonathanCutrell_: I know that, I'm wondering if you do remove it, does that software work (minus the outside event)
[10:25:03] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: it does indeed.
[10:26:28] <Mookman288> JonathanCutrell_: Ok. I understand that you're using this to watch for an event outside, however, are you 100% sure that functionality is implemented correctly? It's hard for me to read the entire program as an outside observer so I'm relying on you to decipher.
[10:28:02] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: I think I might know a little more of where the problem is coming from.
[10:28:17] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: apparently at the moment you can't call the plugin on more than one item.
[10:28:20] <JonathanCutrell_> at a time*
[10:29:04] <Mookman288> Sorry I couldn't be of more use.
[10:29:43] <JonathanCutrell_> Mookman288: no worries - I'll see if I can figure this out a bit better.
[10:30:37] <Whirl3d> In looking at the code for a jquery plugin, I noticed that they define a method several times (with different parameters passed to it). The first token is a regexp. Does jquery run the methods in order until one succeeds?
[10:30:53] <JAAulde> On behalf of TeamJS, I just donated $20 to help feed the hungry. What will you give? http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamJS
[10:31:49] <aadams_> how do i use jquery? i'm stuck on create table; select adams from teachers
[10:32:29] <JAAulde> Don't make David Flanagan (author of O'Reilly Publishing's The Definitive Guide to JavaScript) switch to PHP! ( http://www.davidflanagan.com/2011/12/read-this-or-im.html )
[10:32:39] <imsky> wtf
[10:33:20] <mattalexx> Is there a way to call el.show() and el.hide() in a single method by passing a bool? Like el.showOrHide(show)
[10:33:29] <imsky> ?toggle @ mattalexx
[10:33:29] <bot-t> mattalexx, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[10:34:16] <mattalexx> imsky, Doesn't toggle change the show/hide state based on the current show/hide state? That's not what I want.
[10:34:23] <imsky> nope
[10:34:44] <mattalexx> imsky, Oh cool, thanks
[10:34:47] <mattalexx> Perfect
[10:35:18] <imsky> yw bud
[10:35:59] <winux> Is there a good way to associate a variable (in my case a simple flag) with a particular class, instead of creating a hidden form element that would be switchable?
[10:36:05] <polygon-pusher> if I want to fad in something should I have its css set to show display:none or visible:hidden first?
[10:42:45] <Eviltwin> polygon-pusher: Former makes it take up no space, latter makes it merely not visible
[10:45:33] <Hopsy|2> Stay hungry, stay foolish.
[10:47:50] <imsky> good old jobs
[10:48:57] <Eviltwin> I thought it was, "Stay thirsty, my friends"
[10:58:53] <hvgotcod1s> is it possible to display an image that the user selects off their disk?
[10:59:19] <Eviltwin> hvgotcod1s: Don't believe so
[10:59:32] <takahiro> you mean like an iframe with file:///something.jpg
[11:05:28] <hvgotcod1s> takahiro: yeah i guess that's one way to do it
[11:05:36] <hvgotcod1s> is there another?
[11:06:04] <muley> what are some things i should check if a very large upload isn't working. it's not easy to test things out...
[11:06:14] <muley> can "max_execution_time" be hit on POST?
[11:06:32] <cedeon_> hi all
[11:06:51] <muley> i see "upload_max_filesize" and that seems large enough... just dunno where else to check
[11:07:22] <cedeon_> is there a way to bind an onLoad event to a css background-image property?
[11:07:37] <muley> crap wrong channel..
[11:07:40] <muley> :S
[11:26:53] <mattalexx> Is there a way in jQuery to take two jQuery objects and find the elements that exist in both?
[11:33:35] <insign> mattalexx can you explain better?
[11:35:44] <mattalexx> I have a bunch of jq objects. Some of these objects need to be hidden and some need to be shown. But here's the complicated part. All elements that exist in the jq objects that need to be hidden need to be hidden, even if they also exist in the jq object that needs to be shown.
[11:36:05] <mattalexx> So I'm trying to figure out the best way to accomplish that.
[11:36:11] <mattalexx> insign, ^
[11:36:13] <Whirl3d> var results={}; for (var prop in obja) {if (objb[prop]==obja[prop]){results[prop]=obj[a]}; return results;
[11:36:28] <mattalexx> Whirl3d, Are you talking to me?>
[11:36:34] <Whirl3d> sry, no
[11:36:36] <mattalexx> don't think so
[11:36:38] <mattalexx> ok
[11:37:38] <Whirl3d> mattalexx, do you have classes assigned to the objects that you can filter by?
[11:38:31] <mattalexx> Whirl3d, Not sure what you mean. I have an array of jq objects to be shown, and another array for the ones to be hidden.
[11:39:03] <Whirl3d> sure, but do they each have a class associated with them? I'll make a fiddle to show you what I am asking..brb
[11:39:36] <mattalexx> ok
[11:40:41] <abdel> Hi
[11:41:00] <aerospa> Hi

[11:42:20] <lilmikey> hi
[11:43:08] <Giampiero> :-D
[11:43:08] <lilmikey> is there a standard / proper way to unload a css stylesheet and load a new one via jquery?
[11:44:09] <Giampiero> I'm afraid not my good sir!
[11:44:37] <Italio> Morning, lads
[11:44:41] <Giampiero> Morning all
[11:45:02] <Giampiero> How is it going?
[11:45:14] <lilmikey> allright
[11:45:31] <shesek> lilmikey, if its loaded using <link> elements, you can just manipulate them like any other DOM elements
[11:45:32] <Giampiero> :D
[11:45:37] <Giampiero> good to hear
[11:45:41] <ravenzz> yep
[11:45:46] <shesek> you can delete/add new elements to the DOM
[11:45:48] <ravenzz> just replace its href
[11:46:11] <lilmikey> ok
[11:46:12] <Italio> JamalAkhtar
[11:46:14] <lilmikey> thanks.
[11:46:16] <Italio> salaam bacha
[11:46:29] <JamalAkhtar> Italio: yes?
[11:47:35] <aerospa> giampiero: how's the laravel jquery lib going?
[11:47:51] <Giampiero> aerospa: ya i've been working on it all week :D
[11:48:09] <JamalAkhtar> that sounds great giampiero... i look forward to trying it out when you release it :D
[11:48:20] <tehngid> yh it does
[11:48:27] <Cade> Has anyone had any problems with the lightbox plugin in IE?
[11:48:41] <JamalAkhtar> well IE, whadya expect
[11:48:48] <diimdeep> hello, how load in Google Chrome jQuery from Console ?
[11:48:52] <dogarrhea2> hurray. 1.7 breaks animation
[11:48:59] <tehngid> ie6 yes, iirc but the rest not really
[11:49:07] <dogarrhea2> why dont' people fix bugs in open source ;(
[11:49:14] <Cade>  It's just going straight to the image instead of displaying it in a box
[11:49:16] <tehngid> send a pull request
[11:49:23] <JamalAkhtar> ya send a pull request, thats the whole idea of open source :D
[11:49:26] <Giampiero> indeed :D
[11:49:26] <dogarrhea2> a simple file replacement = backwards compatibility broken. oh well at least i know how to fix it
[11:49:47] <insign> diimdeep, from console? It will work in every page the have jquery with the console opened
[11:49:59] <Italio> I EAT PIE
[11:50:17] <Italio> tITALIAN FRESH PIE +!11111111111111111111111111111111

[11:51:25] <JamalAkhtar> italio: it makes elements italicized, though it is a deprecated tag
[11:51:25] <Giampiero> yes it is a deprecated tag so dont use it :D
[11:51:29] <Giampiero> use css instead
[11:51:34] <JamalAkhtar> css is a much better option yh
[11:51:35] <insign> diimdeep, how what? just type F12 and go to the console tab
[11:51:39] <diimdeep> if page without jQuery, how load it in from console ?
[11:51:44] <Italio> oh so if i do <i> it will make a website for me?

[11:52:49] <aerospa> aerospa: yh im just ironing out a few bugs atm
[11:52:49] <diimdeep> lol, document.write() work just like rm -rf
[11:52:57] <Giampiero> check my pull request btw for the github repo
[11:53:16] <aerospa> ya ive checked it out, will approve it
[11:53:23] <roowilliams> http://roowilliams.dyndns.org/siri/ can anyone tell why the first image is dropped?
[11:53:33] <roowilliams> and then returns to normal when it cycles again
[11:53:39] <Giampiero> all right you remember to do that :D i gotta go now so cya
[11:53:47] <aerospa> giampiero: cya bro
[11:54:47] <aleray> NoiseEee, necromancer sorry I was busy, couldn't reply to you
[11:57:20] <aleray> NoiseEee, necromancer here is the snippet of code I'm busy with: http://dpaste.com/674450/
[11:58:32] <dogarrhea2> for hover, does the event keep firing while the mouse is over the element?
[12:00:54] <ngharo> no, mousein and mouseout
[12:01:14] <ngharo> mouseover*
[12:02:12] <icenine> hi, i have a question about jquery uis datepicker; im using asp.net validation on dynamically created inputs, and the validation is disabled initially until the inputs are created. when theyre created, the ValidateEnable function appears to be focusing the datepicker input. is anyone aware of a way to prevent that focus?
[12:04:00] <john> icenine: I think the validateenable is seeing the '/' or whatever as harmful
[12:04:05] <john> that datepicker puts in
[12:04:39] <lilmikey> what is the opposite of append()
[12:04:49] <lilmikey> ?
[12:05:39] <NoiseEee> remove() ?
[12:05:48] <lilmikey> yea
[12:06:03] <icenine> john: any suggestions? should i just set the input text to empty?
[12:06:09] <icenine> after enabling the validators that is?
[12:06:33] <john> icenine: i dont have much experience with asp.net, but you might try that
[12:06:43] <john> is there anyway to set the fields to allow those characters?
[12:06:52] <john> you should keep security in mind if you do that though
[12:07:37] <icenine> well '/' would be a character that would be allowed for dates anyway, right?
[12:08:08] <icenine> (sry im on day 5 of a new job so im nervous :P)
[12:09:03] <john> I'm not sure how asp.net filters the inputs :/
[12:11:56] <PilotBob> In jQueryUI I see how to remove/add tabs, and how to enable/disable. Is there a way to hide/show?
[12:14:30] <PilotBob> does anyone use jQuery ui tabs?
[12:16:52] <davehimself> i thought there was a way to use jquery to bind events to elements that have yet to be created. anyone know if i'm crazy or not?
[12:16:56] <ngharo> PilotBob: .tabs( "select" , index )
[12:17:05] <ngharo> ?delegate @ davehimself
[12:17:06] <bot-t> davehimself, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[12:17:19] <davehimself> thx ngharo
[12:17:43] <Narinik> will a php script called by jquery maintain a session state?
[12:18:35] <NoiseEee> Narinik: in general, yes, you can use PHP sessions with javascript / xhr.
[12:19:47] <PilotBob> ngharo: if I do .tabs("select", 6),hide() it hides everything.
[12:19:55] <Narinik> Thanks
[12:20:40] <ngharo> PilotBob: do you want to remove a tab completely?
[12:20:45] <ngharo> what are you trying to do?
[12:20:57] <PilotBob> NO, I want to hide or show a specific tab based on the value of a check box.
[12:21:10] <ngharo> you hide a tab by selecting a different one
[12:21:38] <PilotBob> Ok, I want to hide the fact that the tab exists. If I do a remove it also removes the content, which I don't want.
[12:21:56] <ngharo> gotcha
[12:22:01] <PilotBob> Since then if I add my content is gone.
[12:23:18] <PilotBob> ngharo: the closest is enable/disable. but the spec calls for making the tab not visible.
[12:23:30] <ngharo> you could $('.ui-tabs-nav li:eq(index)').hide(); i think
[12:23:39] <ngharo> make sure you switch away from that tab index first
[12:24:16] <Rotham_> hey.. has anyone used the FullCalendar plugin much?  I would like to write a custom view for it, and im wondering if its possible without just forking the code?
[12:26:01] <PilotBob> ngharo: maybe I can just change the style so disabled is actually display: none; hmmm...
[12:27:20] <davehimself> ngharo: this doesn't seem to work for me. any ideas? - http://jsfiddle.net/BJvRr/1/
[12:27:36] <Cade> Funny. I was actually using the regular version of Lightbox. I was using the Jquery plugin elsewhere on the site. Switching to the plugin on this page actually solved my problem.
[12:29:12] <PilotBob> ngharo: ah.. yes, that selector works great. Thanks.
[12:30:02] <ngharo> davehimself: whats the problem?
[12:30:10] <aerospa> what's the best modal dialog library/plugin? I'm looking at SimpleModal (http://www.ericmmartin.com/projects/simplemodal/) at the moment
[12:30:19] <davehimself> on() not working. similar to delegate()
[12:32:21] <ngharo> davehimself: you have your arguments mixed up
[12:32:27] <ngharo> ?on
[12:32:28] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:32:34] <ngharo> you want: $('.post').on('submit', '.reply-form', function(evt) {
[12:33:12] * davehimself facepalm
[12:33:17] <davehimself> thx, ngharo
[12:33:33] <ngharo> :)
[12:34:00] <dogarrhea2> why does animate suddenly stop working properly when the item is animated off screen?
[12:34:14] <dogarrhea2> it exponentionally animates in the wrong direction on set interval
[12:36:04] <dogarrhea2> oh well. open source = bugs
[12:36:21] <dogarrhea2> is there any one actually dedicated to QA on the development team?
[12:37:22] <ngharo> nice.
[12:42:51] <lilmikey> ok
[12:42:57] <lilmikey> why doesn't this work http://jsfiddle.net/wRXYe/
[12:45:08] <ngharo> lilmikey: do dis http://jsfiddle.net/wRXYe/1/
[12:47:52] <lilmikey> ngharo: yea it's the same
[12:48:00] <lilmikey> i was trying to do it in drupal
[12:48:17] <lilmikey> but drupal adds that stupid code to the end of each element in head
[12:48:43] <lilmikey> threecol_25_50_25_stacked.css?lwbbo0"
[12:48:56] <sphinxxx> is it possible to select elements within an iframe?
[12:49:44] <NoiseEee> only if the iframe is in accordance with SOP
[12:53:17] <NoiseEee> is there anything in jquery like prototype's "new Element", or do people just use naturalJS or jquery.html() for new elements?
[12:54:30] <ngharo> lilmikey: dunno that should work
[12:54:41] <ngharo> lilmikey: http://jsfiddle.net/wRXYe/7/ see
[12:55:00] <lilmikey> yea I know
[12:55:04] <lilmikey> the code is good.
[12:55:27] <lilmikey> ngharo: thanks. I think its about the cms.
[12:55:39] <dogarrhea2> so how is something released under mit and GPL
[12:55:44] <dogarrhea2> can you sue someone or not?
[12:55:58] <dogarrhea2> according to GPL if u don't open source everything u can. but mit no. sooo?
[12:56:56] <ngharo> dogarrhea2: wrong channel?
[12:57:10] <dogarrhea2> not really i'm reading the jquery min code
[12:57:17] <dogarrhea2> and there are 3 license things
[12:59:00] <ngharo> dogarrhea2: i believe dual licensing allows developers to release their jquery projects as GPL or MIT
[13:00:09] <ngharo> or whatever
[13:00:35] <ShaunR> is there a way to get a value of GET that was passed in js.  for example the current page has index.php?a=1, i want to use the value of a in my code
[13:01:43] <ngharo> ShaunR: inspect window.location
[13:03:05] <Whirl3d> ShaunR or use Ben Allman's (sp?) .deparam plugin
[13:04:31] <fission6> whats an easy way to toggle between two images when the image is clicked? right now i just change the src attr but how do i change itback to the original if its clicked twice
[13:05:24] <Whirl3d> depending on the images, perhaps you could use sprites? put both images as the background to element thatonly displays half of the background then change background position in css
[13:07:55] <nveid> Is there a way to set the DOM for query?  I want to use query for my safari extension development
[13:08:12] <nveid> for jquery even
[13:09:20] <fission6> Whirl3d: i just came up with this http://dpaste.org/hfExB/
[13:10:21] <nveid> Cause there's multiple DOM's in a safari extension, the toolbar, the global page, etc.. I'd like to modify the toolbar DOM from the global page script
[13:11:15] <nveid> hrm.. I'm guessing it be something along the lines for $(document, "other selector").normaljquerycalls ?
[13:12:20] <JAAulde> Don't make David Flanagan (author of O'Reilly Publishing's The Definitive Guide to JavaScript) switch to PHP! ( http://www.davidflanagan.com/2011/12/read-this-or-im.html )
[13:27:45] <MeirD> Hey. Is there anyway I can use :contains() select to get only the elements that contains a text (and not their parents like :contains() currently returns)
[13:28:14] <prova> !list
[13:30:22] <MeirD> ?
[13:32:10] <hkon_> hello gurus
[13:32:33] <hkon_> could you give some pointers on cleaning up my mess =) http://pastebin.com/BfDr6sxC
[13:32:44] <hkon_> basically i would want an mvc style
[13:32:52] <hkon_> but i'm not quite there yet =)
[13:37:14] <sbisbee> hey - anyone here have some deep knowledge on qunit? Trying to determine why my asyncTest() calls are running out of order when QUnit.config.reorder = false
[13:38:15] <Rotham_> hey... is it possible to break a plugin into multiple files somehow?
[13:38:25] <Rotham_> for development atleast...
[13:38:48] <Rotham_> im not paticularly good at javascript thats why i ask.. is there a way to call a function into the plugins namespace?
[13:42:41] <bjensen> In firefox I get an error in my firebug console "uncaught exception: ReferenceError: elem is not defined" no line number. Shrugâ€¦any idea how to debug?
[13:44:15] <chjj> bjensen: use chrome ;)
[13:44:29] <bjensen> chij: tried. I don't get the error there
[13:44:39] <chjj> k, i blame firefox
[13:44:52] <bjensen> not really an answer I can use :p
[13:45:58] <nveid> anyone else here done any browser extension development with jquery?
[13:47:03] <davehimself> .on() is driving me nuts. it works for elements that are on the page when the page is loaded. but it does not fire events on elements created after the page was loaded. what gives? am i misunderstanding what this function does?
[13:51:10] <ngharo> $('#element_that_exists_now').on(event, '.descendants_that_may_or_may_not_exist_now', func)
[13:52:08] <NoiseEee> davehimself: use event delegation
[13:52:25] <davehimself> NoiseEee, isn't that what on() does?
[13:52:36] <NoiseEee> not by itself, no?
[13:52:42] <davehimself> sigh
[13:52:55] <davehimself> the jquery docs say that on() superseeds delegate() for 1.7
[13:53:03] <davehimself> so i'm confused
[13:53:18] <NoiseEee> $('#parentElementOfThingsThatWillLoadThingsDynamically').on('click',someFunction);
[13:53:36] <davehimself> that's what i'm doing now
[13:53:39] <NoiseEee> where someFunction() queries the event (ie: what element it happend on) and does things appropriately
[13:53:59] <NoiseEee> are you putting that listener on the parent, ie: something that is NOT dynamically removed?
[13:54:17] <davehimself> crap. guess not
[13:54:24] <davehimself> i see now
[13:54:29] <davehimself> on attaches to a parent el?
[13:54:41] <NoiseEee> attach it where you wish
[13:54:42] <davehimself> one that must be on the page when on() is first called?
[13:54:55] <NoiseEee> well yeah, attach it to something that isnt going to be removed
[13:55:09] <NoiseEee> and will be the parent of things loaded dynamically
[13:55:48] <davehimself> that did it
[13:55:50] <davehimself> thx NoiseEee
[13:55:53] <NoiseEee> np good luck
[13:56:29] <mattp_> is there any way to block until an ajax call is complete()?
[13:56:49] <NoiseEee> mattp_: not a good idea / question suggests you're "doing it wrong"
[13:57:09] <mattp_> NoiseEee: i understand it contradicts the 'async' A of ajax
[13:57:32] <mattp_> but i want a function call to return the response of an ajax request, i want it to be synchronous
[13:57:32] <NoiseEee> mattp_: and can lock up the browser, making it seemed crashed/unresponsive, etc
[13:57:44] <mattp_> ah. hmm
[13:57:54] <NoiseEee> mattp_: without using the word 'synchronous', explain what you are trying to do
[13:58:27] <mattp_> NoiseEee: have logic that conditionally fires based on the response of the ajax call
[13:58:47] <NoiseEee> okay, why not have that logic in the callback?
[13:59:13] <mattp_> i understand it would make sense there. but it the function can be called in multiple contexts
[13:59:14] <snover> yo dawg I put some logic in your logic so you could logic while you logic
[13:59:52] <snover> mattp_: not getting how that would be a problem :)
[13:59:56] <NoiseEee> mattp_: then design the function to work in multiple contexts / set the appropriate callback :)
[14:00:13] <mattp_> ya i think thats the way to go. thanks guys
[14:00:21] <NoiseEee> np good luck
[14:00:54] <pvivek> i am a student and beginner of jquery. I am trying to get this time picker working
[14:01:01] <pvivek> but i am not able to .
[14:01:39] <Avrem> hi -> in a .ajax() call, what kind of return from the server calls the success() callback?
[14:02:24] <pvivek> Everytime i try i am going wrong somewhere. My main problem is i don't know how exactly i have to include files and which order.
[14:02:32] <pvivek> http://code.google.com/p/jquery-utils/wiki/UiTimepickr
[14:02:41] <nodestool> Avrem: clearly documented on the site, check it out
[14:04:25] <pvivek> i am sure there'll be experts in here who'd be able to include timepicker to their app in no time at all. if anyone could help me out i would be very glad.
[14:04:43] <nodestool> pvivek: i don't see a question
[14:04:52] <pvivek> Let me shorten my question . I am unable to locate ui.base.css
[14:05:01] <pvivek> where would i find it?
[14:05:29] <nodestool> you are trying to use the calander widget of jquery ui?
[14:06:03] <pvivek> no no. the timepicker seperate http://haineault.com/media/jquery/ui-timepickr/page/
[14:07:16] <Whirl3d> anybody familiar with xRegExp and if so, is it broken with jquery 1.7?
[14:08:18] <nodestool> pvivek: oh sorry, i have not used that plugin before
[14:09:19] <pvivek> nodestool : okay is there any other easier way . I just want to give a small ui of time selection when the user clicks on a text box
[14:09:25] <pvivek> just like datepicker
[14:10:08] <nodestool> pvivek: this plugin seems cool, i just have not used it yet
[14:10:13] <nodestool> pvivek: does it come with examples?
[14:11:14] <pvivek> it does. here is the complete documentation. i got everything working. when i click on the box it displays the numbers everything but just that something with the ui has gone wrong. Instead of coming like a grid as shown in that example the numbers are coming one below the other
[14:11:24] <necromancer> pvivek: there was one i saw that lets you just type the time in
[14:11:30] <necromancer> a la OmniFocus
[14:11:50] <pvivek> nodestool : http://code.google.com/p/jquery-utils/wiki/UiTimepickr
[14:12:42] <pvivek> nodestool: in the example he's included ui.base.css from some url which doesn't exist anymore . The first link in this http://code.google.com/p/jquery-utils/wiki/UiTimepickr URL.
[14:13:09] <pvivek> nodestool: do you have any idea where i can find that ui.base.css
[14:13:25] <Whirl3d> fission6, are you still around? I totally thought I had pasted the link I was showing you:http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/BcxHt/14/
[14:13:50] <blackice2999> hi @all
[14:15:53] <blackice2999> i had a problem. i load a external javascript file via ajax and insert it via .prepend to the head. Is it right that the browser doesnt execute the content in it ?
[14:23:09] <nodestool> blackice2999: it should
[14:23:14] <nodestool> blackice2999: seems something else is trange
[14:25:22] <yamahaalex> http://jsfiddle.net/Ma3Ta/2/
[14:25:40] <yamahaalex> how can i implement a gameloop to make that input work?
[14:44:25] <Whirl3d> what is your preferred captcha/captcha-esque validation plugin for jquery currently?
[14:46:37] <winux> Whirl3d: ? reCaptcha
[14:46:55] <Whirl3d> checking for that now, thanks, winux...
[14:48:21] <winux> Whirl3d: I believe it is the most popular captcha plugin, now owned by Google
[14:54:59] <pvivek> i got the alternative thanks anyway
[14:56:42] <CrawfordComeaux> I wonder why there aren't more captchas built around 3d models...
[15:02:52] <Whirl3d> 3D captcha?
[15:15:14] <dogarrhea2> hrm i need a widget like a scroll bar.  Jquery ui is kind of broken.  here are the details:  it moves as fast as the mouse cursor does when the user moves it, 1 axis movement, continuous.  Any one have any ideas?
[15:16:15] <blackice2999|afk> nodestool: thanks i need to debug it more
[15:35:38] <CrawfordComeaux> Whirl3d: Example of a kind of weak implementation - http://www.yuniti.com/register.php
[15:36:55] <CrawfordComeaux> Whirl3d: design from someone that gets it - http://spamfizzle.com/CAPTCHA.aspx
[15:41:09] <winux> CrawfordComeaux: haha
[15:42:32] <devOlsen> evening all.
[15:43:16] <winux> devOlsen: good afternoon

[16:20:56] <juha_> WAIT A MINUTE!
[16:21:03] <juha_> who is pooping and why wasn't i informed?
[16:21:45] <juha_> after 26 years of pooping, i do consider myself as a sort of an expert on the matter
[16:26:10] <ngharo> poopin aint easy
[16:26:16] <dogarrhea2> it's very easy
[16:26:33] <ngharo> says dogarrhea2
[16:26:43] <dogarrhea2> is there any way to make something draggable and position absolute?
[16:26:52] <dogarrhea2> for the purposes of animating.
[16:28:33] <McManiaC> hey guys, why doesnt this form get submitted? http://npaste.de:8080/rLis/ (the code is actually run on that website)
[16:28:42] <dogarrhea2> basically, i have something that looks like manuscript paper.. but when i click a button it scrolls up and down (animates).  If i drag the cursor on it, i'd also like it to move up and down
[16:29:56] <dogarrhea2> so the question comes down to, "how to animate draggable items" or "how to drag position absolute items"
[16:30:40] <dogarrhea2> oh. i can change it back to position absolute
[16:30:50] <dogarrhea2> draggable just does some retarded stuff and changes the position to relative
[16:44:17] <McManiaC> why doesnt this form get submitted? http://npaste.de:8080/rLis/ (the code is actually run on that website, the form is the select-field on the top right)
[16:49:10] <McManiaC> no one?
[16:54:41] <SrPx> how do I include a lib made for browser ?
[16:55:07] <SrPx> sylvester.js

[17:26:39] <mrgenixus> I"m not finding any explicit declaration: does jQuery support the html video events?
[17:27:24] <mrgenixus> can I , for example $('#myvideo').on('ended',function(){ arbitrary code}); ?
[17:29:02] <nveid> any extension developers here?
[17:29:02] <coldhead> i don't think so, mrgenixus
[17:29:41] <abjorn> sup coldhead

[18:38:42] <joikus> fyi, someone recommended to run this, when trying to show a hidden div which has border-radius, on IE7
[18:38:43] <joikus> if ($.browser.msie) $(cont + ' .box').each(function () { this.fireEvent('onmove') });
[18:38:47] <joikus> does this make sense to anyone?
[18:38:48] <joikus> it works though
[18:41:12] <eddiemonge> joikus: that never makes sense
[18:41:25] <eddiemonge> you should avoid $.browser
[18:43:27] <joikus> actually that's totally buggy
[18:44:13] <joikus> just wondering what would cause a div.box {display:none} and $(function(){ $('.box:first').show() });  not render the rounded corners in IE7
[18:44:27] <joikus> but if I remove that display:none css, it renders it with rounded corner
[18:44:42] <eddiemonge> how are you doing the rounded corners?
[18:48:10] <joikus> im using a .htc file in css
[18:48:25] <joikus> css3pie to be precise
[18:48:35] <joikus> it works fine, it's just this hide/show issue
[18:48:52] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ joikus
[18:48:52] <bot-t> joikus, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[18:49:42] <joikus> ya I would have to setup a demo on my test server
[19:00:28] <yamahaalex> anyone know how i can return the dimensions of a canvas rectangle

[19:04:49] <yamahaalex>     alert(wall.x0);
[19:12:43] <yamahaalex> can i do something like this to declare values and array same time

[19:35:14] <yamahaalex> for (var i = 0; i < walls.length; i++){

[19:36:49] <Gaddel> letterpress1: i did that, but i'm just getting null
[19:39:33] <aple> Here's the jsfid: http://jsfiddle.net/GudXJ/
[19:40:25] <letterpress1> http://jsfiddle.net/G4nkm/
[19:41:44] <aple> ?
[19:42:07] <aple> But I need the val() not the text() to get what's in an input box don't I?
[19:42:59] <aple> letterpress1: were you jsfiddling me?
[19:43:03] <Gaddel> aple: i believe he meant that for me
[19:43:26] <aple> Ah, sorry then
[19:43:29] <letterpress1> no. but find looks inside an element. so with button, you need to use another method, because your input is not inside the button
[19:43:37] <letterpress1> like previous()
[19:43:48] <letterpress1> or closest(".add").find("input)
[19:44:03] <aple> Oh! Durp!
[19:44:12] <aple> haha, I'm sorry, thanks man
[19:44:17] <letterpress1> :)
[19:46:29] <aple> Out of curiosity, is it possible to define selectors alongside of $(this... ?
[19:46:41] <aple> For instance $(this + "ul") or something similar
[19:46:45] <aple> Anything like that?
[19:46:57] <aple> Or do I just have to traverse after the $(this) call?
[20:00:07] <letterpress1> aple, just traverse like $(this).find("ul")
[20:03:34] <ssj> can anyone tell me how can i split sum text using cr and lf as delimiters?
[20:13:11] <letterpress1> ssj would something like this work? http://jsfiddle.net/PfT9e/
[20:14:40] <ssj> i found the answer letterpress1 still thnx for the help :)
[20:15:09] <ssj> i actually tried \r\n but that works in IE only thats what i read atleast
[20:15:26] <ssj> content.split(/\r\n|\r|\n/); that did the trick :)
[20:16:59] <letterpress1> nice
[20:17:25] <ssj> IE and Opera convert it to \r\n while others use \n
[20:23:07] <davock> are jquery and jquery mobile incompatible when I include them both on the same html?
[20:23:21] <davock> I can't include jquery 1.7 with jquery mobile 1

[20:45:10] <amiterandole> http://test123.netmagicsolutions.com/slider/json/Plans_JSON_file.json
[20:45:14] <amiterandole> check it
[20:45:32] <amiterandole> I want to get at the Plan level
[20:45:45] <amiterandole> and then iterate over each
[20:45:58] <ssj> multiple each shud do it i think
[20:46:11] <amiterandole> ya but I don't know how
[20:47:01] <amiterandole> here's what I have: https://gist.github.com/1489226
[20:47:54] <amiterandole> I tried nesting one each inside another each but I am not good at it
[20:49:17] <crab> what happens when you run your code?
[20:51:01] <amiterandole> I get an error saying undefined
[20:52:48] <ssj> console.log(plan[i].PlanName);
[20:53:23] <ssj> umm i m not sure but shudnt that be console.log(plan['PlanName']); sumthing like that
[20:53:28] <ssj> i m newbiemyself :P

[20:54:21] <ssj> its fine
[20:56:40] <crab> amiterandole: the error you get is the one word, "undefined"?
[20:57:10] <amiterandole> no one sec
[20:57:48] <ssj> amiterandole console.log(plan[i].PlanName); its doesnt look correct to me since plan is the value
[20:58:00] <amiterandole> ya
[20:58:09] <amiterandole> If I do this: console.log(plan['PlanName']);
[20:58:17] <amiterandole> I get one word error: undefined
[20:59:11] <ssj> var map = obj.Response.Plans.Plan;
[20:59:16] <ssj> can u print that out?
[20:59:22] <ssj> and post the result
[20:59:24] <amiterandole> ya one sec
[21:00:17] <amiterandole> Oh yeah ssj
[21:00:20] <amiterandole> that did it
[21:00:22] <ssj> umm shudnt u iterate over that instead of var map = obj.Response.Plans;

[21:02:01] <crimlo> hey people
[21:02:30] <amiterandole> given this data, how do I now parse this to find plans that have more than 1 CPU?
[21:02:34] <crimlo> how come i still do not understand jquery?
[21:02:45] <dr0id> because its awesome like that
[21:02:52] <crimlo> ;)
[21:03:06] <crimlo> life sucks
[21:03:21] <dr0id> awww .... :(

[21:03:50] * ssj agrees with crimlo on life sucks
[21:04:16] <ssj> umm amiterandole check for the cpu value ?
[21:04:24] <amiterandole> ya but how ssj?
[21:04:38] <amiterandole> like what kind of function do I write?
[21:05:00] <amiterandole> sorry for sounding like a dumbass. I am a writer by profession who loves coding
[21:05:05] <amiterandole> but sucks at it
[21:06:20] <ssj> i m a kid by profession who sucks at coding :v
[21:06:27] <amiterandole> heh heh

[21:07:02] <ssj> console.log(plan['Cpu']);
[21:07:07] <ssj> returns the value right?
[21:07:12] <amiterandole> ya
[21:07:30] <amiterandole> I'll tell you my favorite function in underscore.js that does this
[21:07:47] <amiterandole> http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
[21:07:55] <ssj> if the value > 1 then do wateva u want
[21:07:59] <amiterandole> Its filter
[21:08:12] <amiterandole> or reduce
[21:08:19] <amiterandole> but should I use $.each
[21:08:22] <amiterandole> ?
[21:09:02] <amiterandole> I want it to return just the keys that match the values in an array
[21:10:08] <crimlo> i don't even know what an array is..... my life sucks big-time!

[21:15:07] <crimlo> i do have a reason, just dont know how to get started
[21:15:17] <crimlo> and no one to help guide me
[21:15:19] <ssj> and the reason is..
[21:15:42] <ssj> no one's gonna help :P
[21:15:43] <crimlo> i want to create sexy websites
[21:15:51] <crimlo> i know they wont
[21:15:56] <ssj> lol !!
[21:15:59] <crimlo> which is why i think life sucks
[21:16:02] <ssj> no one helped me :/
[21:16:15] <crimlo> well i would have if i could have
[21:16:32] <ssj> i meant u need to learn yourself o.O
[21:16:35] <nveid> everyones is too busy to spoon feed you the whole way
[21:16:37] <yamahaalex> you dont know where to get started creating sexy websites?
[21:16:54] <crimlo> no i dont
[21:16:55] <ssj> u trying to read crimlo ?
[21:16:58] <nveid> If you have an exact question along the way, chances are you might get some help
[21:17:03] <crimlo> it bores me
[21:17:09] <crimlo> reading is for geeks
[21:17:14] <ssj> watch vid tuts then o.O
[21:17:18] <nveid> Well making sexi website is for geeks too
[21:17:23] <yamahaalex> crimslo, there is this thing used to make websites, its called html
[21:17:25] <yamahaalex> you have to learn it
[21:17:28] <crimlo> screen-cast also bores me
[21:17:39] <ssj> get a life :)
[21:17:41] <dr0id> well, then go troll in #web
[21:17:42] <nveid> Then you obviously have no business even trying crimlo, go screw yourself
[21:17:52] <dr0id> or even better, diaf
[21:17:53] <crimlo> i am familiar with html/xhtml
[21:17:58] <yamahaalex> crimlo, perfect
[21:18:02] <yamahaalex> great start
[21:18:06] <yamahaalex> now, this part is important
[21:18:06] <ssj> start writing :)
[21:18:11] <crimlo> i want to learn frameworks
[21:18:16] <yamahaalex> there is this thing used to style websites, its called css
[21:18:29] <yamahaalex> with it, you can create very sexy websites
[21:18:30] <crimlo> i know css like the back of my hand
[21:18:31] <nveid> There is this thing called to make dynamic spiffy content, javascript
[21:18:52] <yamahaalex> crimlo, if you know css like the back of your hand, then you wouldnt be in here asking how to create a sexy website
[21:18:53] * ssj doesnt know javascript :(
[21:18:54] <yamahaalex> because you would know how
[21:19:33] <crimlo> still lacking the cool effects that frameworks/ajax brings to the table
[21:19:44] <nveid> If you know css like the back of your hand, then you should be able to do sexy with no problem
[21:19:50] <ssj> crimlo google is ur answer :D
[21:19:53] <nveid> especially if you know css3
[21:19:55] <yamahaalex> crimlo, so you meant to say dynamic websites, not sexy?
[21:19:58] <crimlo> i hate google
[21:20:10] <crimlo> sexy is dynamic bro
[21:20:15] <yamahaalex> ok
[21:20:24] <yamahaalex> then the last and most important part of information for you
[21:20:26] <dr0id> y u no mootools ? :(
[21:20:28] <yamahaalex> is this thing called javascript
[21:20:41] <crimlo> mootools is lame
[21:20:44] <yamahaalex> learn it, and you will have graduated sexy websites
[21:20:51] <ssj> why not jquery yamahaalex ?
[21:20:52] <nveid> Or hell.. You can skip javascript completely & just make full blown server side java apps
[21:20:57] <yamahaalex> ssj,  jquery is javascript
[21:21:05] <systemfault> You don't even need javascript to write sexy websites
[21:21:07] <crimlo> nveid i wish
[21:21:18] <ssj> but still yamahaalex :P
[21:21:25] <yamahaalex> systemfault, it was according to his definition, sexy = dyamic effects or somethin
[21:21:44] <crimlo> i wonder why he keeps recommending mootools in stead of jquery
[21:21:45] <yamahaalex> ssj, jquery is great, but i wouldnt try learning it before javascript
[21:21:53] <nveid> Read about Javascript & DOM
[21:22:03] <nveid> google that stuff will get all the stuff you need to know
[21:22:07] <crimlo> thats where i got lost
[21:22:08] <dr0id> I learnt jquery before JS, it was awesome, and I know no JS :(
[21:22:12] <crimlo> what the hell is DOM
[21:22:24] <dr0id> DOM is like the google maps of your locality
[21:22:27] <nso95> ...Really?
[21:22:34] <yamahaalex> dom is like the eenie to your minie
[21:22:46] <yamahaalex> the miny to your moo
[21:22:59] <nveid> query is more or less a fronted to the DOM
[21:23:01] <nveid> jquery even
[21:23:14] <yamahaalex> dr0id, LOL! you know jquery before js?
[21:23:14] <crimlo> so its query in jquery?
[21:23:28] <dr0id> ofcOURSE
[21:23:41] <nveid> jquery.. dumb client autocorrected me
[21:23:53] <yamahaalex> dont complicated dom definition. crimlo its just Document Object Model. it means things are objects
[21:23:59] <crimlo> one does't need to know javascript in order to know jquery
[21:24:10] <ssj> yamahaalex i still dont know javascript :(
[21:24:19] <nso95> one should know javascript
[21:24:21] <crimlo> (objects)?
[21:24:21] <nveid> You don't need to know EVERYTHING about javascript, but you do need to know the basics
[21:24:23] <dr0id> the browser builds a DOM out of your html, css, js where each element/node is an object with properties. guess that's the simplest explanation ? you can traverse the DOM to mess with the objects and interact with each elements in your html.
[21:24:26] <yamahaalex> uhh crimlo , guess not, but why would you limit yourself like that, when jquery IS javascript
[21:24:42] <ssj> umm i know basics
[21:24:53] <crimlo> droid
[21:24:53] <ssj> i know document.write :v
[21:24:59] <dr0id> Document Ob ject Model
[21:25:00] <crimlo> be my sensei
[21:25:02] <yamahaalex> and i guess you could say you know jquery without javascript, but really learning jquery is learning javascript
[21:25:06] <nveid> crimlo.. That involves understanding javascript operators, understanding arrays, understanding switch, if statements, how to make functions, etc..
[21:25:08] <RishiKul> hi #jquery :) this is my wordpress site http://www.tresdots.net/ in this I'm having my theme image slider, its working fine the only thing is missing is the thumbnails for the images something like this guy has done http://lucid.co.in/web_design/gallery.html (but it is in flash) for that I tried this plugin http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/portfolio-slideshow/screenshots/ but since my theme is single page this plugin is not gonna w

[21:28:22] <ssj> actually i had a problem :P
[21:28:30] <yamahaalex> why are we talking about mEWWtools
[21:28:44] <crimlo> footools
[21:28:45] <ssj> laptop out of energy :(
[21:29:04] <dr0id> I'll teach you JS and jQuery and PHP for just at $50/hr
[21:29:10] <nveid> onto something else.. Has anyone here done any Safari Extension development?
[21:29:10] <crimlo> i am not a cow, i rebuke mootools
[21:29:13] <dr0id> with HTML,CSS, Mysql, etc.
[21:29:14] <RishiKul> what is the difference between 'min.js; and '.js'
[21:29:21] <nveid> Trying to figure out how to get jquery work on my toolbar

[21:29:38] <dr0id> msg  me
[21:30:30] <RishiKul> what should I do to get thumbnails of the image in the image slider of my site http://www.tresdots.net/
[21:30:44] <RishiKul> thumbnails below every image
[21:31:39] <ssj_> umm u peeps still here?
[21:31:44] <ssj_> dr0id?
[21:32:03] <crimlo> he's busy
[21:32:09] <ssj_> umm has anyone ever used jquery ajax in ie?
[21:32:31] <yamahaalex> im sure ssj
[21:32:42] <dr0id> ofc
[21:32:46] <crimlo> duh
[21:32:47] <dr0id> jquery made ajax awesome
[21:32:52] <dr0id> actually jquery is JS at its best :P
[21:32:53] <nveid> sure
[21:33:01] <crimlo> i agree droid
[21:33:18] <nveid> if javascript was smart, that'd make jquery standard library. :)
[21:33:21] <yamahaalex> i avoid using jquery as much as possible
[21:33:49] <yamahaalex> or... as much as conveniently possible
[21:34:08] <nveid> really?
[21:34:24] <nveid> I find query makes accessing the DOM, & modifying stuff super easy
[21:34:32] <ssj_> i dont know what was messed up
[21:34:33] <nveid> jquery.. grr stupid colloquy
[21:34:46] <ssj_> but i had sum code using ajax which was working in chrome
[21:34:55] <ssj_> but was giving object error in ie :/
[21:35:06] <ssj_> first it was saying no trasport :/
[21:35:15] <nveid> so apparently IE is a little more strict with the javascript
[21:35:34] <nveid> what version of IE are we talking?
[21:35:35] <ssj_>    jQuery.support.cors = true;
[21:36:02] <ssj_> umm actually it was a software :P
[21:36:03] <dr0id> ssj_: most probably an extra comma issue :P
[21:36:05] <ssj_> using IE
[21:36:09] <RishiKul> wycats: hi
[21:36:23] <ssj_> dr0id u heard bout bots to play games?
[21:36:37] <dr0id> for example iirc $.post(url, data, function(data){},); - will give you error in IE
[21:36:39] <nveid> ssj_: there are MANy versions of IE, and just about EVERY version is drastically different in how things work
[21:36:52] <dr0id> ssj_: not sure what you mean
[21:37:10] <ssj_> umm now how do i explain this
[21:37:42] * nveid wonders why the world doesn't just drop IE already...

[21:38:57] <nveid> Hell.. I'm about tired with firefox as well since they started their rapid release cyclesâ€¦ But, things work with firefox.  Chrome is decent as well..

[21:43:23] <Braden`> http://pastebin.com/8Eq4VXdV  <--- How would I make the results update after each character is added to the input box?
[21:43:24] <ssj_> i tell em i play ~_~
[21:43:36] <black_warlock> and now you tell them to stop
[21:43:40] <Braden`> The relevant code is at the bottom
[21:43:53] <black_warlock> that you was wrong
[21:44:03] <black_warlock> or
[21:44:07] <black_warlock> sell app
[21:44:24] <ssj_> imma ask for a account on my birthday :v
[21:44:30] <ssj_> and a android phone :v
[21:44:39] <Braden`> Anyone?
[21:44:50] <nveid> I'd never give my kid an android phone with how much them data plans cost. :P
[21:44:59] <black_warlock> get prepayd card visa electron is good for payball
[21:45:10] <ssj_> nveid i want to get into android developement :P
[21:45:10] <nveid> just me & my wife, I'm paying about $240/mo for the damn cellphone
[21:45:24] <ssj_> Braden` ask dr0id :P
[21:45:26] <black_warlock> wtf
[21:45:35] <ssj_> thats insane nveid !!
[21:45:39] <Braden`> Here in the Philippines I pay $10/mo for our cell plans
[21:45:42] <Braden`> $5 for each
[21:45:47] <nveid> With full data plans & everything?
[21:45:52] <black_warlock> you can have a b!tch for 100 dolars a mont
[21:45:54] <Braden`> No, the data plans are $20
[21:46:01] <nveid> wow.. Phillipines is cheap
[21:46:11] <ssj_> damn yea :O
[21:46:13] <nveid> Ironic part is, I get a company discount as well
[21:46:15] <Braden`> I never use that though since wireless hotspots are everywher here
[21:46:24] <ssj_> wait :P
[21:46:29] <ssj_> its the same price here :V
[21:46:29] <nveid> supposedly I get 30% off my verizon bill
[21:46:30] <ssj_> $20
[21:46:43] <nveid> where you at ssj?
[21:47:03] <ssj_> india
[21:47:07] <ssj_> Braden` ya alive ?
[21:47:10] <ssj_> or dead x( ?
[21:47:12] <rue> That's relatively expensive given the normal CoL in the Philippines. The US and Canada are just terribly expensive, though.
[21:47:13] <Braden`> I am :)
[21:47:15] <nveid> Ahh.. I guess its just the US is expensive as hell
[21:47:42] <ssj_> so everytime sumthing is typed
[21:47:45] <Braden`> Well, in terms of economics, the US cellular carriers operate as a ogiopoly
[21:47:47] <ssj_> u want to do sumthing?
[21:47:49] <Braden`> (sp)
[21:47:56] <Braden`> That probably results in a higher price
[21:48:08] <Braden`> In developing countries its much more free market based
[21:48:24] <Braden`> I think in european countries its very heavily gov't regulated
[21:48:28] <nveid> its probably mostly to do with the all regulation required to set anything up in the US
[21:48:35] <Braden`> ssj_:  Yes, sorry
[21:48:36] <rue> No, that's not it at all.
[21:48:37] <nveid> Regulation is killing the US
[21:48:43] <Braden`> I would like it to display new results each time something is typed
[21:48:55] <rue> nveid: Nearly everywhere else is more regulated.
[21:49:24] <nveid> Regulated in terms of FCC, fines, fee's and licensing radio spectrums?
[21:49:27] <ssj_> ohh its a searchbox Braden` ?
[21:49:32] <Braden`> No, more in price regulation
[21:49:38] <Braden`> ssj_:  Yep :)
[21:49:41] <nveid> I seriously doubt that one Braden
[21:49:49] <Braden`> nveid:  I am just speculating
[21:50:12] <Braden`> I do know in the US we only have a few carriers (two serious ones (verizon, cingular)
[21:50:19] <Braden`> In the philippines there are quite a few
[21:50:21] <Braden`> Not sure about india
[21:50:55] <nveid> cingular is at&t now
[21:51:01] <ssj_> Braden`
[21:51:05] <ssj_> u try keyup?
[21:51:10] <Braden`> nveid:  I've been gone for too long
[21:51:26] <Braden`> ssj_:  I read thats what I need to use, but I cannot figure out how to tie it into my implementation
[21:51:33] <nveid> Even when there was a million carriers 10 years ago, it was still expensive though
[21:51:53] <Braden`> Well, 10 years ago the technology was more expensive
[21:52:10] <Braden`> Heck, I remember in 2003 I paid $2,400 for a 15" laptop with a P4 processor
[21:52:16] <kamo> I am having an issue with select not working right in ASP.net
[21:52:22] <Braden`> Two years ago I bought a core 2 duo with 15" screen for $650
[21:52:39] <nveid> really?  I got the something for $300 2 years ago. :P
[21:52:50] <Braden`> Mineraturization and refinement of manufacturing processes has brought prices down considerably
[21:53:48] <nveid> well.. definitely off topic now, back to my dev work
[21:54:19] <ssj_> i bought this shit last year for around $1000
[21:54:25] <ssj_> i regret it :/
[21:55:31] <ssj_> umm wat isnt working Braden` ?
[21:55:39] <nveid> wow.. that has to be super expensive in india
[21:57:12] <ssj_> i got it from US nveid :V
[21:58:03] <nveid> I'm just saying the price tag of $1000, thats like a lot of money over there isn't it?
[21:58:20] <nveid> I mean, thats a lot over here.. So I'm thinking it has to be even more over there
[21:58:52] <dr0id> india ? whose in india ?

[22:07:17] <ssj_> let me set it up droid
[22:07:20] <RishiKul> dr0id: I need your help, I want thumbnails for my images in my image slider here http://www.tresdots.net/ what can I do for that?\
[22:07:24] <ssj_> the messed up the jquery
[22:07:58] <Braden`> ssj_:  Do you have any suggestions for me? :)
[22:08:02] <dr0id> make thumbnails ?
[22:08:12] <ssj_> no Braden` :/
[22:08:27] <ssj_> i wonder if onchange event works for this
[22:08:33] <dr0id> nice site, did you design ?
[22:08:46] <ssj_> since the value is changing
[22:08:58] <dr0id> coldhead !!!
[22:09:15] <ssj_> dr0id?
[22:09:23] <dr0id> nah, not you
[22:09:25] <dr0id> :P
[22:10:56] <dr0id> Braden`: bind keyup/change event to the input field ?
[22:11:06] <RishiKul> dr0id: means like this http://s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/portfolio-slideshow/screenshot-1.png thumbnail of that image in the slider
[22:11:16] <dr0id> $('input').keyup(function() { // update results });
[22:11:39] <ericandrewlewis> loving ui-sortable B)
[22:11:43] <RishiKul> dr0id: what can I do for that?
[22:12:03] <dr0id> just use that WP plugin ? :P
[22:13:56] <RishiKul> dr0id: thanks, but it won't work with my theme cause its single page theme, I have to use this plugins feature of displaying the correspondence image as thumbnail in the slider, that's why I wanna know which part of code can be used to get thumbnails
[22:14:16] <dr0id> that's more of a WP question
[22:14:37] <dr0id> altho I think you'll have to use a a combination of custom fields and some thumbnail generation plugin
[22:15:19] <RishiKul> dr0id: yeah I asked it in WP, they suggested me why can't it happen, and suggested me to ask in #jquery :( the only thing I want is to display the thumbnails of my images in my slider
[22:15:51] <dr0id> is the slider and image custom coded or coming from WP posts ?
[22:15:52] <ssj_> how are the thumbnails generated  ? O
[22:15:54] <ssj_> :O
[22:16:07] <dr0id> slider with images*
[22:18:55] <RishiKul> dr0id: in my theme I'm having a custom image slider so images in that slider is coming from the custom post
[22:19:56] <RishiKul> dr0id: http://pastebin.com/GsjNYy1c this is my custom.js
[22:20:03] <dr0id> well, don't know what custom posts are. if they are coming from WP's post stuffs, then there are custom fields I remember that you can use. else just add the thumbnails in a ul/li
[22:20:09] <dr0id> last I worked with WP was 2 years ago ;o
[22:21:34] <RishiKul> ok
[22:22:15] <RishiKul> dr0id: sorry to asking this noob question, but how to add thumbnails in ul/li ?
[22:22:43] <dr0id> <ul><li><img src="/path/to/thumbnail.jpg" alt=""></li>...</ul>
[22:25:26] <aple> Anyone have any experience with jQueryUI Sortable? I'd like to know how to save the sorting.
[22:26:08] <aple> For instance, if Joe Shmoe moves Item #4 to Slot #9, then goes to another computer and looks at the page, Item #4 is still in Slot #9.
[22:28:06] <nveid> curious.. not really jquery related, but does anyone know how to get the time left on a setInterval?
[23:01:11] <AlexPanchetta> Hello. I have a script that shows a navigation bar when someone hovers over a photo
[23:01:23] <AlexPanchetta> but how do I make the navigation bar disappear when the person stops hovering over it?
[23:32:30] <roflbbq> Using jQuery 1.6.2, how can I access back the element currently iterated by the first each() call, from the second each() call ? http://www.pastebin.mozilla.org/1409291
[23:33:50] <dr0id> name it somewthing else but not item ? or store talents' item in a var ?
[23:35:54] <roflbbq> Hell yeah i just forgot about scopes .... i was juste wondering if jquery did provide such a thing. Still new to it:P
[23:36:31] <dr0id> yeah. no scopes in programming languages would be awesome!
[23:58:25] <dogarrhea2> hmm.  So I have discovered some visual bugs. maybe it's with chrome. maybe it's with jquery. whenever you drag something around on the screen, there are visual bugs..
[23:58:42] <dogarrhea2> basically png image appearances change alpha values become distorted etc.
[23:58:59] <dogarrhea2> when you scroll down the screen and up again, the visual bugs disappear
[23:59:04] <dogarrhea2> anyone know what's going on?
