[01:01:41] <p3rsist> Hi guys. Is there a jquery plugin that can handle a content slider in a modal dialog?
[01:01:59] <_zoggy_> raj, tablesorter or datatables
[01:02:17] <_zoggy_> http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/index.html
[01:02:53] <raj> _zoggy_, i cam across tablesorter...but this one looked awesome http://www.picnet.com.au/picnet-table-filter.html
[01:06:04] <_zoggy_> yeah i personally like tablesorter
[01:06:09] <p3rsist> Guys, if I want to add various addresses and use a modal dialog for input, I don't want the user to close and open the dialog every new address. Is there a way, to go the next address from in the already opened modal dialog?
[02:24:14] <bjensen> how do I make an AND selector? for example I want nodes that have the .user class and the "data-user-id" attribute with the value 3 ?
[02:25:41] <bjensen> $(".user div[data-user-id=3]") thats not an and..
[02:36:10] <raj> bjensen, use a comma
[02:36:33] <raj> http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
[02:37:05] <raj> wait, sorry, that would be OR I think
[02:38:46] <bjensen> yeah thats OR
[02:39:56] <Woet> $(".user").is("div[data-user-id=3]")
[02:39:57] <raj> bjensen, how about just removing the 'div'
[02:39:57] <Woet> i suppose
[02:40:13] <raj> $('.user[data-user-id=3]')
[02:40:49] <raj> alternatively, you can use .filter()
[02:41:17] <raj> let me know if the first one worked though
[02:41:27] <bjensen> ah I can use .foo[data-user-id=3]  ?
[02:41:46] <raj> try it and see
[02:41:58] <bjensen> will do
[02:42:02] <raj> I'm not sure, just threw that out there
[02:42:09] <raj> i'd like to actually know if it worked too :)
[02:43:20] <bjensen> nope it doesnt
[02:43:25] <raj> ok
[02:43:28] <bjensen> but thats what I am trying to express..
[02:43:35] <raj> well, .filter() will definitely work
[02:43:45] <bjensen> Right. thanks :)
[02:43:51] <raj> welcome
[02:45:23] <raj> this channel has been havoc without Eviltwin, Cork, and the rest of the heavy hitters
[02:45:34] <bjensen> ah sorry raj, it does indeed work :)
[02:45:46] <raj> which?
[02:46:13] <bjensen> var competence_list = $(".competence_check_boxes[data-workshop-id=113]");
[02:46:36] <bjensen> thats valid and works
[02:46:39] <raj> ok, great
[02:46:43] <raj> what was wrong the first time?
[02:46:55] <bjensen> I had a syntax error :-/
[02:47:00] <raj> ah ok
[02:47:02] <raj> cool
[02:47:18] <bjensen> but it gave me a chance to learn about #filter, so thanks for that as well :)
[02:49:39] <node__> help me!
[02:49:42] <node__> http://pastebin.com/ZDjJ9VUJ
[02:49:47] <node__> why does that not work?
[02:49:58] <node__> what silly syntax error am i overlooking
[02:50:48] <raj> node__, 1) put it in jsfiddle
[02:52:47] <raj> 2) node__, I believe your issue is the dom is not loading before your script
[02:53:07] <raj> you need to put it in a document.ready function
[02:53:43] <node__> what do you mean?
[02:56:35] <raj> $(document).ready(function(){})
[03:02:00] <node__> raj: THANKS!
[03:02:01] <node__> :D
[03:30:19] <adam007> hello any one can help about php ? maybe im wrong channel but idk where i must ask
[03:36:47] <rue> â€¦Try ##php?

[03:51:28] <olinux> dabear, perfect - thanks!
[04:02:04] <_ramo> hi
[04:02:31] <_ramo> i'm using th jquery ui modal dialog. is there a way that the modal dialog scrolls down when i scroll on the underlying page?
[04:05:13] <dabear> _ramo: trigger manually, by listening to window scroll: $(window).bind("scroll", fn)
[04:05:15] <dabear> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Window.scroll
[04:09:23] <_ramo> dabear: but how can i manage it, that the modal dialog scrolls down too?
[04:19:12] <xec> _ramo: you can do that with css, position: fixed;
[04:21:14] <_ramo> xec: do you know why i can't use the browser scroll bar if the modal dialog is opened?
[04:22:14] <_ramo> xec: just define in my css file a #dialog:ui-dialog { position: fixed; } ?
[04:22:45] <xec> basically, yes, but that selector doesn't look right
[04:23:34] <xec> i didn't think jquery ui modal stopped you from using the scroll bar?
[04:24:42] <_ramo> xec: it is... it's working when i use my scroll wheel or the arrow buttons, but if i click onto the scroll bar and try to move it down, this is not working if the dialog is open
[04:24:53] <xec> ?demo
[04:24:53] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:25:48] <xec> i just looked at http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/modal-message.html and made the window super small to get scroll bars.. they seem to work fine
[04:25:51] <_ramo> i didn't get it working with the position:fixed
[04:26:23] <_ramo> i don't mean the scroll bars in the modal dialog. i mean the scroll bar in the browser when the modal dialog is open
[04:27:07] <xec> yes
[04:27:39] <xec> can you reproduce in a jsfiddle?
[04:27:48] <_ramo> hm, i have to try
[04:30:53] <xec> actually, it looks like you can't just set position fixed in css, see http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/2848
[04:34:39] <_ramo> xec: it's not fully working: http://jsfiddle.net/EebkT/2/
[04:34:45] <xec> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-position-a-dialog-relative-to-a-div-instead-of-relative-to-the-viewport
[04:35:47] <xec> _ramo: added the jquery ui css: http://jsfiddle.net/EebkT/4/
[04:37:36] <_ramo> and how could we make this page scrollabel?
[04:38:27] <xec> insert some content:P that last link i posted to the forum might just be referring to starting position
[04:38:44] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/EebkT/5/
[04:38:56] <_ramo> xec:  http://jsfiddle.net/EebkT/6/ try it in chrome
[04:39:13] <_ramo> it's not working in chrome
[04:39:42] <xec> hey, you
[04:39:48] <xec> 're right, i was in firefox
[04:39:53] <_ramo> yep
[04:40:12] <_ramo> can you biuld in that position thing?
[04:40:43] <xec> yeah but it didn't do much
[04:41:18] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/EebkT/7/
[04:44:22] <_ramo> xec: ah, but the box is not going when scrolling
[04:45:03] <xec> exactly. but the position: fixed; works http://jsfiddle.net/EebkT/8/
[04:46:05] <xec> the no clicking on scroll bar in chrome seems to be a bug http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4671
[04:55:28] <_ramo> xec: hmm. it seems that it's not working... for me... i mean if i include it into my page
[05:00:13] <node__> so confused
[05:00:32] <node__> this iframe isn't refreshing even though it should be
[05:00:36] <node__> when i click the refresh button
[05:13:58] <Amel> Hello, how would I connect queries together? For example this won't work: $('div').$('span')
[05:14:17] <Amel> I don't want to do $('div span') because I need to be able to use $(this)
[05:15:31] <peol> Amel, 'div, span'
[05:15:54] <Amel> I don't understand
[05:16:08] <Amel> I'm unable to do $(this + ' span')
[05:16:35] <peol> Do you want to find those elements within this, or just have this PLUS all spans?
[05:16:56] <Amel> Within
[05:17:06] <peol> $(this).find('span')
[05:17:10] <Amel> Thank you
[05:17:43] <dabear> why would you assume that this + " span" would work?
[05:17:45] <Amel> So simple, I just couldn't find it anywhere :)
[05:17:56] <dabear> where did you ever read that? 0o
[05:17:57] <Amel> I didn't, I just tried everything I could think of
[05:18:03] <peol> Amel, http//api.jquery.com
[05:18:13] <peol> eh, http://api.jquery.com
[05:18:30] <raj> I'm adding elements via a button. I'd like to bind a clickoutside event ( http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/ ) for when an area outside of the added element is clicked. But I'm not sure how to pull that off. Any ideas?
[05:18:51] <peol> Amel, specifically, look at traversing in the menu on the left
[05:18:52] <ioncache> As an alternative to api.jquery.com, give http://jqapi.com/ a tryâ€¦much better interface
[05:20:15] <Amel> jqapi looks nice
[05:20:26] <Amel> Thank you I will take my leave now
[05:22:35] <squeakytoy> Hm, lets say I have a string. "myobject.myfunction" <-- how can i "convert" that string to that actual function? so i can write: var a = something("myobject.myfunction"); <-- and a actually points to myfunction
[05:24:39] * ready holt seinen penis raus
[05:30:58] <dabear> raj: clickoutside event cannot be delegated. so the only option is to do .bind("clickoutside", ...) on the new element being added
[05:31:04] <dabear> each time a new element is added
[05:31:28] <raj> dabear, that's what I was trying to do according to https://github.com/vakata/jstree/blob/v.1.0/jstree.core.js#L1450
[05:31:38] <raj> (which is the element I'm trying to add)
[05:33:07] <raj> dabear, however, --> $('.colors').jstree("create_node", -1, "last", function(e,data){console.log(data.rslt.obj)}) does not work
[05:34:15] <raj> it doesn't output anything
[05:34:17] <raj> any ideas?
[05:35:40] <dabear> raj: not quite sure what you're trying to do
[05:35:58] <dabear> note that I have never used jstree before either
[05:37:15] <dabear> raj: so what are you trying to do? do you want a new jstree node to be created when an element is clicked outside?
[05:37:32] <raj> oh sorry
[05:37:37] <raj> I have a button that adds a node
[05:38:07] <raj> and each node is selectable (just gets a .tree-clicked class on it)
[05:38:54] <raj> i want that class removed if anything outside of the created node is clicked
[05:41:02] <dabear> ok, so you have a click handler on the button. in that handler you add a new node which also has a class "tree-clicked". can you save that new node to a variable as well?
[05:41:45] <dabear> if so, why can't you just do $thatnewnode.bind("clickoutside", function(){  /* remove the clicked class from this here*/} )
[05:41:45] <raj> the added node is just ".tree-leaf"
[05:42:04] <raj> if I click the node, it adds ".tree-clicked"
[05:42:22] <raj> which puts a blue background behind that particular node
[05:42:37] <raj> I definitely shoulda had a fiddle on this
[05:42:39] <raj> sorry about that
[05:43:33] <raj> dabear, reason I can't is because $thatnewnode is added programmatically
[05:43:45] <raj> so I can't bind something to a node that doesn't exist
[05:44:15] <dabear> oh, so the node is dynamically created and destroyed multiple times?
[05:44:31] <raj> well, not yet destroyed
[05:44:33] <raj> but created
[05:44:43] <raj> i'm gonna have a button to remove a node too
[05:45:14] <dabear> yeah but you are doing the addition of the node in the click handler
[05:45:23] <raj> yes
[05:45:30] <dabear> nothing prevents you from selecting the new element after it is created
[05:45:45] <dabear> element=node
[05:47:02] <raj> right
[05:47:09] <raj> but where is the element coming from?
[05:47:20] <raj> function(e,data) ? e is the element?
[05:47:22] <raj> i thought it was the event
[05:47:58] <raj> https://gist.github.com/ed5cc628aaa93c2a7269
[05:47:58] <dabear> my guess is that "this" or "e.target" is the element
[05:48:25] <raj> i was trying to use data.rslt.obj
[05:48:41] <raj> as per https://github.com/vakata/jstree/blob/v.1.0/jstree.core.js#L1450
[05:49:08] <dabear> data.rslt._obj_
[05:49:15] <dabear> according to that file
[05:49:28] <raj> yeah, but then in the example below it uses data.rslt.obj
[05:49:33] <pen> is it possible to make a normal request (like a link) with jquery or javascript?
[05:49:37] <raj> the docs for jstree REALLY are terrible
[05:49:39] <pen> given the url
[05:50:15] <dabear> raj: I see that. do this: console.log(data.rslt)
[05:50:33] <dabear> open the console in chrome or firebug in firefox
[05:50:40] <dabear> and inspect what keys are actually there
[05:51:49] <raj> dabear, the console.log() isn't even getting called in that gist i pasted
[05:52:08] <raj> so something must be wrong with my callback function(e,data)
[05:55:34] <dabear> try removing all code in the callback and replace it with this: console.log(arguments)
[05:58:06] <raj> dabear, still nothing
[05:58:10] <raj> it just doesn't get called
[05:58:19] <dabear> then I've no idea
[05:58:28] <dabear> ?reduce @ raj
[05:58:29] <bot-t> raj, Try reducing your code to the simplest example that still breaks, and *then* show it to us. Often you'll discover the answer in the process.
[05:58:31] <raj> i'm gonna make a fiddle though to make this less annoying
[05:58:36] <dabear> ?p @ raj
[05:58:37] <bot-t> raj, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:58:46] <raj> seriously?
[05:58:48] <dabear> note that reduce part :)
[05:59:46] <pullover> i have a page and page opens a popup
[05:59:57] <pullover> when user close popup i want to refresh page
[06:00:30] <pullover> i am using a close button on popup if user click that button everything works fine
[06:00:34] <dabear> ?mdc document.location @ pullover

[06:09:02] <Smjert> Hello everyone, i have a problem with jquery ui dialog box: i add to the html a span (also tried with div, with p) to show some text when clicking the Ok button, the first time it works, but then if i close the dialog then re-open it and click OK, no text appears. I've already tried to change the span width/height when assigning the text but nothing fixes it. Here's a snippet of the code http://jsfiddle.net/bkhYr/.
[06:10:05] <Smjert> Maybe it's just a dumb html/js error i'm doing but i don't see why it shouldn't work
[06:17:30] <raj> dabear, finallllyyyyy ---> http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/yvZAR/8/
[06:21:17] <raz> hrm
[06:21:23] <raz> how do i match elementes that have been added with html()?
[06:21:47] <dabear> raz: match? what do you mean?
[06:22:13] <raj> raz, you mean select?
[06:22:23] <raz> dabear: the following does not work for me: foo.html('<div class="bar">...</div>'); $('.bar').css('background: #f0f');
[06:22:56] <dabear> .css({"background": "#sada"})
[06:23:35] <raz> doesn't work either, the selector doesn't match
[06:23:35] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[06:24:24] <raz> uh, sec
[06:25:26] <raz> sorry, it seems everything is alright
[06:28:14] <pen> how do I check to see if mouse is in a div?
[06:28:19] <raj> dabear, any idea what might be wrong with our callback?
[06:28:21] <pen> in another event handler
[06:28:48] <raj> and I say 'our' cuz you're fully involved with this now, it's ride or die :)
[06:28:52] <pen> for example, I am listening to body click but I want to know if this click is in a div or not
[06:28:55] <dabear> raj: no idea. complex solution: implement event delegation to figure out when a new element is clicked outside.
[06:28:58] <pen> how do I do that?
[06:29:40] <dabear> raj: easy solution: avoid the callback, use livequery instead to detect new elements added. and then attach a clickedoutside event on that new element. see http://brandonaaron.net/code/livequery/docs
[06:29:43] <raj> 1) I'm not sure what you mean 2) you're suggesting a workaround since the callback isn't working?
[06:30:14] <raj> dabear, ok, so forget everything else...can we figure out how to make a callback work?
[06:30:26] <raj> cuz I'm gonna need that one way or another
[06:34:04] <raj> worst documented plugin ever
[06:51:24] <cambazz> hello, i need to make an internationalized adress entry form.
[06:52:01] <cambazz> i would do it except i need a list of countries, and list of cities in that county, etc.
[06:52:11] <cambazz> i was wonderign if there was an easier way
[07:04:47] <angelazou> hi, I need a jquery plugin/script that will allow rows to be rearranged
[07:04:56] <angelazou> like this http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/ or this http://jsfiddle.net/S5TLG/
[07:05:24] <angelazou> but the problem with both of them is that they can't save the order they are in
[07:11:32] <Smjert> angelazou, actually you can with .serialize using jquery ui sortable
[07:12:09] <Smjert> pardon, .sortable("serialize", [options])
[07:12:48] <Smjert> if you look in the methods tab of the sortable details you'll see it
[07:19:51] <Lobosque> I'm making an ajax request that returns the following json data: http://pastebin.com/8yGYP99K For some reason, sometimes data.length returns undefined. Any ideas why or another way to get the number of elements?
[07:22:26] <ner0x> What's the most popular menu item jquery mod?
[07:23:50] <Pavel> Lobosque: there is jquery size() but im not sure if it isnt just an alias for .length
[07:25:07] <Pavel> size: function() { return this.length;
[07:25:09] <Pavel> i guess it is
[07:27:17] <Pavel> Lobosque: but anyway, check if you can use length on json object, because it may be invalid data type for that method
[07:27:54] <Lobosque> Pavel just found that length can't be used in objects
[07:28:03] <Lobosque> so I just wrote a function to count them...
[07:29:28] <Pavel> Lobosque:  good to know :)
[07:43:14] <Eren> I'm trying to use template plugin. However, when I provide valid json, it does not renders
[07:43:38] <Eren> $("#select").tmpl(" {'foo': 'bar'} ")
[07:43:41] <Eren> isn't it used that way?
[07:45:36] <raj> Eren, I think template has its own <script> tag and some other special syntax
[07:45:47] <Eren> raj: right
[07:45:57] <Eren> I just saw that it works when I feed native javascript array
[07:46:06] <Eren> however, I get the response from server in text form
[07:46:18] <raj> not sure what you mean
[07:46:22] <johnkpaul> Eren: I don't think that tmpl is implemented as a plugin
[07:46:25] <raj> that's not an ajax call
[07:46:41] <raj> johnkpaul, isn't it a plugin of some sort for jquery-ui?
[07:46:51] <johnkpaul> I think it's jQuery.tmpl($("#select").text(),dataObject)
[07:47:03] <johnkpaul> ?jquery.tmpl @Eren
[07:47:05] <bot-t> Eren, jQuery.tmpl() - Render the specified HTML content as a template, using the specified data. http://api.jquery.com/jquery.tmpl/
[07:47:30] <johnkpaul> I mean, it _is_ a jquery plugin
[07:47:44] <johnkpaul> but it is not implemented as a conventional plugin that you can call on jquery objects
[07:48:19] <PhonicUK> is there a 'not' selector?
[07:48:39] <johnkpaul> ?:not
[07:48:40] <bot-t> :not(selector): Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[07:48:44] <raj> gotcha
[07:49:02] <johnkpaul> ^^ @PhonicUK
[07:49:21] <PhonicUK> i feel bad for not just googling it first now
[07:49:58] <johnkpaul> :) that's societal pressure in action
[07:50:30] <PhonicUK> well its a bit hypocritical since i'm always telling people off for the same thing
[07:50:38] <PhonicUK> but xchat was open and chrome wasn't xD
[07:51:00] <RPkS> I'm using a jcarousel image scroller to list additional product images beside the main product image. It's working well except when there isn't any additional product images the scroller will disappear from view. Then the next div is getting pulled into it's spot which creates issues.
[07:51:25] <johnkpaul> ?example @RPkS
[07:51:26] <ner0x> I guess the better question is, do people use superfish jquery plugin?

[07:52:16] <raj> k, didn't know this was part of an ajax callback
[07:53:45] <johnkpaul> prashles: you mean a console?
[07:53:49] <johnkpaul> in a browser?
[07:53:53] <johnkpaul> or you're using jquery in node or something?
[07:53:55] <prashles> yes
[07:53:58] <prashles> in browser
[07:54:08] <johnkpaul> https://github.com/chrisdone/jquery-console
[07:54:15] <johnkpaul> I actually just used that
[07:54:16] <johnkpaul> a week ago
[07:54:18] <prashles> You beautiful man <3
[07:54:35] <johnkpaul> :) why thank you, I pride myself on my good looks
[07:55:46] <prashles> that is EXACTLY what i was looking for
[07:55:48] <prashles> Thanks so much
[07:57:54] <johnkpaul> no problem, prashles
[07:58:50] <RPkS> johnkpaul: Will a live link be okay?
[07:59:28] <johnkpaul> sure
[08:01:03] <Christer> Can anyone look at this problem ? Its described in the fiddle :) Thanks: http://jsfiddle.net/XDHQN/9/
[08:01:51] <RPkS> https://hiddencameragear.com/cellphone-recon-usb-surveillance-tool
[08:02:11] <johnkpaul> oh RPkS, I remember you
[08:02:16] <johnkpaul> did you change your nick?
[08:02:35] <RPkS> Yes, this is my proper nick
[08:03:19] <RPkS> It's working great on any page that has at least 1 extra image
[08:03:40] <johnkpaul> Christer: $(". connectedSortable li").map(function(i,el){return $(el).text()})
[08:03:44] <RPkS> This link is another matter. LOL    https://hiddencameragear.com/accuview-digital-picture-frame-color-camera-hidden-dvr
[08:04:05] <InDigital> rr
[08:04:18] <johnkpaul> so RPkS the firs tlink that you sent looks fine to me
[08:04:45] <RPkS> Yes, it's the 2nd link that's a problem
[08:04:47] <Christer> johnkpaul: can i use .val or .prop('id') to get the id instead on elements like this?
[08:05:01] <Christer> i dont care about the text .. :)
[08:05:16] <Christer> or, not the ID, but the VALUE.
[08:05:16] <RPkS> I just thought it was only fair to show you how it should look
[08:08:47] <johnkpaul> Christer: yes, you can use val
[08:08:53] <johnkpaul> but list items don't have a value
[08:10:18] <RPkS> johnkpaul: Did you see the 2nd link I posted, it's a page that is misbehaving.
[08:12:10] <Smjert> I'll retry with my problem: i've made a working test with jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/bkhYr/1/, click open login, click OK button... the text appears, close the dialog box then reopen it with Open Login, click OK button, no text appears.. why?
[08:16:16] <johnkpaul> RPkS: yes, I see the page, but I don't know what the issue is from the page
[08:16:27] <johnkpaul> can you describe what is happening?
[08:17:41] <RPkS> johnkpaul: Try this link and you will see the problem  https://hiddencameragear.com/accuview-digital-picture-frame-color-camera-hidden-dvr
[08:17:53] <InDigital> rr
[08:17:57] <InDigital> :P
[08:20:17] <RPkS> johnkpaul: When the jcarousel disappears it is causing the next div "right" to pulled into it's position and that is keeping div class="right" from floating to the right.
[08:21:27] <johnkpaul> hm, so 1) this is a css issue, so you might get better traction in #css
[08:21:42] <johnkpaul> and 2) it really seems like you've done very little work in trying to solve it, even though that might not be true
[08:22:11] <RPkS> johnkpaul: When the jcarousel disappears it is causing the next div "right" to pulled into it's position and that is keeping div class="right" from floating to the right. ....Ohhh, well then thank you for looking.
[08:23:17] <RPkS> Well much to my embarrassment I have to admit to investing more time than I want to reveal. LOL
[08:23:53] <johnkpaul> :) so RPkS, I just noticed that .right is _inside_ .left
[08:24:00] <johnkpaul> I think that you want them to be siblings
[08:24:09] <RPkS> I've learned so much so quickly that sometimes there is a little faultline in my thinking and I will miss something that is painfully obivious.
[08:24:26] <johnkpaul> yeah, that's ok, the obvious things are always the hardest to find without someone else checking you
[08:24:30] <johnkpaul> let's talk in #css
[08:24:31] <RPkS> Yes, that is my problem. Right is being pulled into the empty space
[08:24:53] <asher^> hi all, im looking to load a list of options for a dropdown menu via ajax and then populate the menu with those items plus two more items (one at the start and one at the end), whats the cleanest way to achieve this? i dont think i should be putting a div or whatever inside the <select> tags
[08:34:30] <pats_Toms> hi, is there any way to get if stuff after jquery .load() is loaded? I have many images there and I want to create loading popup message.
[08:37:32] <pats_Toms> if i use .load(´one.txt´, function(){alert()}); I got done message when only html is loaded, not all images :/
[08:38:29] <arkh_> in that example, .load is only getting the one resource - it wouldn't know to grab the associated images
[08:39:07] <pats_Toms> but is there any way?
[08:39:25] <dabear> pats_Toms: count number of images
[08:39:40] <dabear> then attach load handlers to all images
[08:39:57] <dabear> when all handlers have run, all images are also loaded
[08:40:24] <arkh_> for X number of images, get each image, increment a counter, and update a progress bar or something similar should counter / X for progress amount
[08:40:50] <dabear> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/910727/jquery-event-for-images-loaded
[08:41:18] <kpol> hey, does anyone know, how this plugin is able to do its job?
[08:41:18] <kpol> http://pjax.heroku.com/
[08:41:59] <kpol> especially the location change
[08:42:07] <johnkpaul> RPkS: you're going to need to figure out what oscommerce is doing differently for those pages, I know nothing about how that works
[08:42:50] <dabear> kpol: html5 pushstate
[08:42:53] <dabear> googleit
[08:44:18] <dabear> kpol: http://pjax.heroku.com/jquery.pjax.js search for window.history.pushState in that file
[08:45:03] <johnkpaul> Smjert: are you still around?
[08:45:14] <Smjert> yep
[08:45:20] <johnkpaul> the problem is that when you "close" the dialog box, it doesn't remove the elements
[08:45:23] <johnkpaul> becuase you _could_ open it again
[08:45:28] <johnkpaul> so that #error div
[08:45:31] <johnkpaul> or span rather
[08:45:32] <johnkpaul> is still around
[08:45:47] <p3rsist> Hi guys. Is there a way to replace content in a modal dialog? For example, I want to input multiple addresses one after the other in the same popup?
[08:45:55] <johnkpaul> so when you update #error, it's updating that dom element hidden somewhere in the dom, rather than the new one that you just injected
[08:46:40] <Bjornet> Hi, I try to init another language in my UI Datepicker. In this simple example Iv managed to set it up, though when I use same code on my localhost the first month that is shown is written in ENglish, and when I push the next, prev month buttons it picks up in some asian language... any ideas?
[08:46:42] <Bjornet> http://jsfiddle.net/bjornet/KaNvu/
[08:46:59] <kpol> dabear: thanks
[08:47:04] <Smjert> johnkpaul, oooh i see... so to successfully close the dialo should i do .dialog("close") in beforeClose or something like that? or it's the same?
[08:47:08] <Bjornet> The lang I want is swedish
[08:47:13] <onykage> p3rsist: just do something like $('#modal').html(data);
[08:47:13] <johnkpaul> yeah, that's the same
[08:47:19] <johnkpaul> I think it's destroy?
[08:48:04] <onykage> anyone know a way to force a js file to reload from the head of the dom?
[08:49:14] <onykage> p3rsist: $('#modalwindow').click(function(){
[08:49:14] <karega> Has anyone noticed that the jQuery plugin chosen doesn't behaving like a normal selectbox when attempting to browse elements?
[08:49:26] <onykage> grrr>...
[08:49:56] <karega> such as if I press C twice in a state list it should goto Colorado
[08:52:10] <onykage> p3rsist: http://www.pastie.org/3750540
[08:52:20] <onykage> that should do what your asking
[08:55:22] <onykage> off topic..  dont know if anyone likes dubstep+breaks but this cat mixing on di.fm is jammin
[08:55:32] <onykage> linnk if your interested :

[08:55:52] <asher^> hmm, does anyone know how id get the value atrribute from the first option in a select dropdown?
[08:56:42] <Smjert> johnkpaul, thnx for the help, i had to use .remove() though, otherwise with .dialog("destroy") won't work :\
[08:56:55] <johnkpaul> Smjert: ah ok, well glad you figured it out
[08:57:12] <arkh_> onykage: sounds like he's had his caffeine this morning - I like
[08:57:44] <onykage> yeah dude is jammin it
[08:58:19] <onykage> not so great right this min but when i tossed the link he was falling off the shelf
[08:59:31] <onykage> asher^: what are you using as a selector for this combobox?  you need to know how your going to select said option to be able to grab it.. follow?
[09:00:41] <asher^> onykage, i know how to select the <select> element itself, its grabbing the value of the first <option> thats throwing me
[09:00:54] <onykage> asher^: to answer your question verbatum which isnt what I believe your after is just $('#selector').val();
[09:01:15] <asher^> i dont want the selected one, i want the first one in the list
[09:01:35] <razzi> asher .. $('selector option').attr('value')
[09:01:45] <razzi> s/selector/select
[09:02:07] <onykage> $("#target").val($("#target option:first").val());
[09:02:20] <hobs> onykage: I thought my stream skipped because I have this song
[09:02:24] <hobs> but nope
[09:02:29] <asher^> thanks
[09:02:33] <onykage> or $("#target")[0].selectedIndex = 0;
[09:03:23] <asher^> $("#target option:first").val() worked a treat, cheers
[09:03:36] <razzi> you can leave out :first
[09:03:51] <raj> johnkpaul, what're your thoughts on http://brandonaaron.net/code/livequery/docs ?
[09:04:12] <onykage> aye props to stackoverflow and google http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1414276/how-to-make-first-option-of-select-selected-with-jquery
[09:05:08] <onykage> anyone know a way to force reload a .js from the head of the dom without reloading the dom itself?
[09:05:26] <johnkpaul> raj: afaik, livequery is pretty much integreated into jquery now as .live()
[09:05:38] <raj> oh, really
[09:05:39] <johnkpaul> which is now deprecated for .on()
[09:05:56] <raj> the purpose was for a dynamically created element
[09:06:09] <raj> so that I didn't have to .bind() onto the created event
[09:08:01] <onykage> hobs: whats the title of that dstep track di was playing when you said that
[09:09:21] <raj> johnkpaul, i'm using $('.newnode').bind('clickoutside', function(){/*dosomething*/})
[09:10:50] <hobs> it didnt show the title
[09:10:53] <hobs> but it was the low key one
[09:11:23] <hobs> man I cant even remember the song off the top of my head
[09:11:30] <onykage> yeah you said you have the track which is why i asked if you knew the title
[09:11:33] <onykage> ahh np
[09:12:28] <onykage> they display the title to the track if you stream in something like winamp but im not running windows so no winamp for me.
[09:13:07] <hobs> ill listen to my non standard music till I find it
[09:13:15] <hobs> it might be a few days
[09:13:19] <onykage> nah man dont worry with it
[09:13:28] <onykage> i'll here it again
[09:13:35] <hobs> well its partially an excuse to listen to all my robutte music again
[09:13:43] <onykage> hahahha
[09:13:47] <RPkS> johnkpaul: I'm aware that you are working in 2 channels at a time, so I will address you directly to make it easier for you. Yes, carousel194 disappears when there are no extra product images to display. When that happens .right gets pulled into the vacant position.
[09:14:16] <onykage> ahh this dom thing is driving me crazy
[09:15:48] <onykage> when you have items like $('#myitemid").click() in the js but you load the dom in parts and the part of the dom with that item idea doesnt exist on pageload then the onclick event doesnt work because the dom was already scanned at pageload
[09:16:23] <RPkS> onykage: Yes, I think mine is a dom issue too, but I don't have a dom clue how to fix it. ;)
[09:17:11] <johnkpaul> raj: look into .on() it is a very flexibile way of handling everything
[09:17:27] <onykage> heh, well I know how to fix my issue its just a very hackish way to do it and i hate hacking the code up to make it work
[09:17:30] <johnkpaul> RPkS: so if there is no caursefl194, you shouldn't be using jqcarousel
[09:17:30] <raj> johnkpaul, it can't work with clickoutside events though, correct?
[09:17:58] <RPkS> Hmmm, now I am confused for sure.
[09:18:31] <johnkpaul> hm, raj, it should work fine
[09:18:37] <johnkpaul> clickoutside is a jquery plugin right?
[09:18:40] <raj> for rizzle?
[09:18:41] <raj> yeah
[09:19:06] <johnkpaul> jquery doesn't make any big difference between a real event and events using its custom event system
[09:19:10] <johnkpaul> it should work fine
[09:19:17] <raj> crap, that's a game changer
[09:19:19] <raj> thanks
[09:20:01] <johnkpaul> :) no problem
[09:20:16] <johnkpaul> RPkS: it's really hard to discuss this without understanding the code
[09:20:23] <johnkpaul> from what I can tell, you have two pages
[09:20:34] <johnkpaul> one page has a div #carousel94 and the other doesn't
[09:20:42] <johnkpaul> in both, you are invoking jcarousel on #carousel94
[09:20:54] <johnkpaul> in the case where you have no div #caorusel94, there are problems
[09:21:00] <RPkS> johnkpaul: The stylesheet that the jcarousel is using is called carousel.css ...there is no mention of carousel194 in it.
[09:21:19] <johnkpaul> I don't think it's a stylesheet problem
[09:21:21] <johnkpaul> can you try this, RPkS
[09:21:26] <johnkpaul> add pictures to the item that's not working
[09:21:30] <johnkpaul> and see if it's still not working
[09:21:39] <RPkS> sure just a minute\]
[09:24:20] <RPkS> johnkpaul: and instantly the page is correct when an image is placed.
[09:24:39] <johnkpaul> ok, so then you need to trace through your code figuring out what is relying on an image being there
[09:25:51] <RPkS> Whoa... that sounds over my head at leazst on the surface
[09:26:02] <thomedy> if im doing ajax.... i need to validate what goes to my php and not jus t the php correct?
[09:26:05] <thomedy> both sides
[09:26:25] <alexr2> thomedy, it depends on what you're doing and how user friendly you want it to be
[09:26:31] <RPkS> johnkpaul: I do not see 194 in my carts stylesheet either.
[09:26:56] <thomedy> i like very friendly
[09:27:24] <alexr2> then yes, you should validate on both ends
[09:27:38] <thomedy> so js js validation is for interface more than anything
[09:27:41] <alexr2> yes
[09:27:45] <thomedy> cool
[09:27:53] <thomedy> okay that still means validate and thank you
[09:28:19] <thomedy> since i have no idea what to expect to get for validating i have to google that but thank you
[09:28:50] <alexr2> if you're working in html5, it can do some validation for you i think
[09:28:58] <alexr2> like date/email validation type stuff
[09:29:10] <alexr2> but that'll only work with html5 compatible browsers
[09:29:58] <thomedy> no 5 in this program but in the next fiew it will be 5 heavy
[09:31:18] <alexr2> well then yes, google will help you out quite a bit :-)
[09:36:41] <p3rsist> onykage: Why the empty before the html? The html is not supposed to replace the content anyway?
[09:37:27] <onykage> p3rsist: yeah i believe it does actually
[09:38:18] <onykage> p3rsist: just remove the empty() and it should fix you up
[09:56:10] <RPkS> johnkpaul: The only 2 places I can find carousel94 is in my Product.tpl file (opencart pulls the code for the product pages from that folder) and I notice it in view page source itself http://puu.sh/oymR
[09:58:34] <RPkS> jpohnkpaul: carousel94 does not show up in styles.css, carousel.css, jquery.jcarousel.min
[09:59:01] <RPkS> johnkpaul: carousel94 does not show up in styles.css, carousel.css, jquery.jcarousel.min
[10:05:22] <bjensen> Im using the bbq hash change plugin which is doing wonders with the back button with my ajax requests. The problem however arises when I try to make local links for example: <a href="#policy_headline">jump to policy</a>, because that triggers my hash change block thus invoking the bbq plugin. Does anyone have any ideas?
[10:08:01] <johnkpaul> RPkS: can you try removing jcarousel? does it then look the same on both pages?
[10:08:32] <nerdseven> I'm having a really hard time getting prop to work on a checkbox for some reason and was hoping for some help.
[10:08:34] <johnkpaul> bjensen: are you preventing default?
[10:09:03] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @nerdseven
[10:09:03] <bot-t> nerdseven, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[10:09:24] <nerdseven> did it
[10:09:34] <nerdseven> still scratching my head
[10:09:38] <bjensen> johnkpaul: yes. But I don't want to, but the bbq will be be invoked automatically regardless because of the $(window).hashchange(function(e) {} block
[10:09:52] <bjensen> I don't want it to be invoked
[10:10:36] <johnkpaul> hmm, I don't know how hashchange works
[10:10:38] <bjensen> In the hash change block an ajax request is invoked, which is invoked because the hash changes because of the local link using the #
[10:10:48] <johnkpaul> inspect the event, perhaps there's a way to check which element created it
[10:11:07] <johnkpaul> bjensen: yeah, I see what you mean, does teh event obj have a way to get the original target?
[10:11:16] <bjensen> ah never mind then. I was looking for people who was using the plugin and found a way around it :)
[10:11:55] <johnkpaul> there probably is one, bjensen
[10:11:59] <johnkpaul> I just don't know it off the top of my head
[10:12:14] <bjensen> johnkpaul: I think you are right
[10:13:51] <johnkpaul> bjensen: worst case, you could add a .mousedown on your local links
[10:13:54] <johnkpaul> and then check it in the hashchange
[10:13:56] <johnkpaul> but that's ugly
[10:14:10] <johnkpaul> better case, fork bbq, and submit a patch adding that feature
[10:14:31] <bjensen> well Im not sure what would be the right way to go about it, thus I came here
[10:14:54] <bjensen> I am not really in a good position to contribute to a feature I am not sure how should be implemented
[10:16:24] <nerdseven> If I'm using $('#ship2diff').prop('checked', true); in a click function should I be able to see the value of checked changing in firebug?
[10:16:42] <johnkpaul> nerdseven: not in the dom inspector
[10:17:20] <nerdseven> K.
[10:18:14] <nerdseven> I was confused because I am also using $('#ship2diff').prop('value', 'Y'); and I *can* see that change in firebug as the element is checked/unchecked
[10:18:40] <onykage> is there a way to reload the dom without reloading the page?  or more specifically reload the head without reloading the dom?
[10:19:20] <johnkpaul> nerdseven: when you change the prop for the checkbox, the checkbox is visibly changing, right?
[10:19:36] <nerdseven> Yep it is.
[10:20:18] <johnkpaul> bjensen: so it's a ben_alman plugin, so he'd be able to give more input but from looking at the source, if there's no native event, it falls back to a setTimeout poll of window.location.hash
[10:20:28] <johnkpaul> in that case, there'd beno way to tell that it came from the click of a link
[10:21:03] <johnkpaul> nerdseven: that's the difference between prop and attr
[10:21:11] <johnkpaul> .prop changes the underlying property, not the attribute in the dom
[10:21:23] <nerdseven> I wonder if I need to specify both.
[10:21:47] <johnkpaul> not for any reason I can guess, you shouldn't need to care what the attribute in the dom is
[10:21:51] <johnkpaul> after it's been loaded at least
[10:22:36] <nerdseven> This checkbox controls whether to use an alternative address for a customers' shipping info.
[10:23:05] <johnkpaul> ok, but where are you checking for the attribute explicitly?
[10:23:30] <johnkpaul> either you can use $("#checkbox").prop("checked") or $("#checkbox").get(0).checked
[10:23:41] <johnkpaul> why would you need to care about the attribute?
[10:23:54] <johnkpaul> unless you're serializing the DOM to send back to the server or something
[10:24:15] <nerdseven> I'm not 100% sure, unfortunately.
[10:24:39] <nerdseven> I'm just trying to feel my way through the code of X-Cart on this one.
[10:26:03] <asher^> anyone know how i can get a json response from a .get request to be usable as an object outside of the .get function?
[10:28:54] <nerdseven> When that checkbox is checked, X-Cart sets a variable called $ship2diff ... I wonder if I have to unset that variable when the thing is unchecked though. Can that be done via jQuery?
[10:29:14] <johnkpaul> $ship2diff is a php variable?
[10:29:25] <johnkpaul> ?callbacks
[10:29:26] <bot-t> johnkpaul, jQuery.Callbacks() - A multi-purpose callbacks list object that provides a powerful way to manage callback lists. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[10:30:05] <johnkpaul> hm, bot-t, what's the standard explanation for how asynchronous callbacks are executed after all the current code has finished execution
[10:30:51] <johnkpaul> asher^: you need to restructure your code to do that, the callback that runs in your .get() runs _after_ all of that js finished executing
[10:34:03] <nerdseven> sorry, $ship2diff is a smarty variable.
[10:34:22] <asher^> johnkpaul can you be a bit more specific? what would i need to put inside the callback function to have that object accessible elsewhere?
[10:35:27] <RPkS> johnkpaul: "RPkS can you try removing jcarousel? does it then look the same on both pages?" I'm not sure I understand
[10:37:06] <johnkpaul> asher^: if you just need it globally, you can add window.data = data in your callback
[10:37:17] <asher^> thanks
[10:37:21] <johnkpaul> but that won't be available in the code immediately following your $.get()
[10:37:27] <asher^> right
[10:37:51] <asher^> thankyou
[10:37:56] <johnkpaul> RPkS: remove the javascript that creates the jcarousel
[10:37:57] <johnkpaul> asher^: noproblem
[10:43:24] <RPkS> johnkpaul: I was given 2 lines of code to add to my product.php page 	$this->document->addScript('catalog/view/javascript/jquery/jquery.jcarousel.min.js');
[10:43:24] <RPkS> 	 $this->document->addStyle('catalog/view/theme/default/stylesheet/carousel.css');
[10:43:24] <RPkS> Is there a way to comment out the jquery.jcarousel.min.js temporarily?
[10:44:12] <RPkS> I assume // will work
[10:44:55] <minimyran> Hi. I want to store a boolean var of whether or not a sibling has a class named active-popup, how do i do this? :(
[10:45:24] <minimyran> sibling of $(this)
[10:46:22] <dabear> var hasActiveSibling = !!$(this).siblings().filter(".active-popup").length;
[10:47:35] <minimyran> what does the .length part do? checking if the length is >0?
[10:48:04] <dabear> counts the siblings that matched the previous filter
[10:48:16] <minimyran> aha, thank you very much! worked great!
[10:48:26] <RPkS> johnkpaul: I commented out the line and reloaded both pages. The images are showing up to the left of the large image, but all of the styling and container box is missing.
[10:51:40] <nerdseven> WEirrddd.
[10:51:57] <nerdseven> So, it turns out my issue was not really with the $ship2diff variable.
[10:52:34] <asher^> hmm, how would i search an array of objects to find the object with the id im after? does jquery have a function for that?
[10:52:59] <nerdseven> I ended up just leaving that alone, and let x-cart do what it needs to...the issue was with my setting of 'var stuff = $('#ship2diff_box :input');' being too broad. It was including something in there that was preventing the $ship2diff variable from being toggled.
[10:54:21] <johnkpaul> ?filter @asher^
[10:54:21] <bot-t> asher^, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[10:54:25] <dabear> asher^: objects? or jquery objects?
[10:54:38] <asher^> objects, non-DOM
[10:54:56] <johnkpaul> oh, I assumed jquery object
[10:56:11] <johnkpaul> asher^: you can use [].filter if you are in >= IE8
[10:56:18] <johnkpaul> or you can use the es5 shim to add it
[10:56:23] <johnkpaul> or you can use underscore
[10:56:28] <johnkpaul> or you can add .filter yourself
[10:56:32] <johnkpaul> :) there are many options
[10:56:37] <asher^> ok, thanks
[10:58:05] <dabear> or you can use $.filter(expr, elems)
[10:58:55] <dabear> undocumented though

[11:21:16] <bluepnume> Hi there -- what's the best way to add html to a page? The jquery templating plugin looks perfect, but it seems to be deprecated now -- what's the best practice for this kind of thing?
[11:22:53] <bluepnume> I have a generic list item that I'd like to add multiple times with different variables, but creating an element in my javascript and appending it seems a bit messy -- mixing page logic with structure

[12:00:51] <vinx> hello, i need to load some JSON file from local using javascript (Jquery) see. http://pastebin.com/4vG9jF0v but i have different issue.. ( permission for instance... ) Anyone already tried some suggestions?
[12:02:47] <zduffy> How can I fix this snippet (The date string) to make my if statement work? http://pastebin.com/4sfQ0qqy
[12:03:47] <zduffy> vinx have you tried changing permissions for that folder?
[12:04:29] <zduffy> just to test give the folder 777 permissions and rerun
[12:04:50] <ajpiano> zduffy: you have to compare the timestamps
[12:05:04] <ajpiano> the result of compaing date.getTime() or coercing the date to a number
[12:05:05] <vinx> zduffy actually.. it is working in firefox but not in chrome or similar... but anyway.. this whould be part of an "offline" application.. it is possible for js/jquery to load data from local file system?
[12:05:07] <ajpiano> ?eval +new Date
[12:05:10] <bot-t> ajpiano: 1333911904799
[12:06:51] <Phoon> Is there a method to remove *all* event handlers from a given DOM node?
[12:07:07] <ajpiano> ?unbind
[12:07:07] <bot-t> .unbind([eventType], [handler]): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[12:08:11] <Phoon> Two questions: 1. Does unbind() work on event handlers defined in the HTML (ie, with the onclick= attribute)? 2. Is there a way to get a list of all handlers on a node?
[12:08:17] <zduffy> ajpiano: How would I write that? Im sorry I'm dense today
[12:08:30] <Phoon> I'm trying to write an XSS prevention script for a class project
[12:09:49] <ajpiano> zduffy: i don't know what format the date you have the datepicker is in, is date2 a date object?
[12:10:17] <ajpiano> ?eval +new Date >= +new Date(2012, 3, 30)
[12:10:20] <bot-t> ajpiano: false
[12:10:29] <zduffy> ajpiano: date2 is the correct format
[12:10:33] <ajpiano> k ^^
[12:10:37] <ajpiano> so do your april 30th thing like that
[12:10:44] <ajpiano> months start at 0 in js so 3 is april
[12:12:41] <zduffy> Like this? http://pastebin.com/Jf37c9bE
[12:18:22] <zduffy> Got it. Thank you so much ajpiano
[12:30:30] <Amzul> hi, can my iframe change the location of it parent? i do manage to execute a function in the parent and inside that function i am doing stuff but when it comes to changing the location nothing happend. i understand location is read only for the iframe but the document.location = "new location" is in the parent and being executed from the parant. i try many variation location.href="new location";
[12:30:30] <Amzul> nothing seems to work.
[12:33:28] <alexr2> have you tried http://av5.com/docs/changing-parent-window-s-url-from-iframe-content.html ?
[13:50:43] <Torava> now this is weird
[13:51:06] <Torava> $('div').index('#l3') returns -1
[13:51:37] <Torava> but if i test $('#l3').index('div'), it returns 204
[13:51:47] <Torava> oh
[13:52:06] <Torava> i might have answered to my own problem...
[13:56:01] <Torava> yes. helped to write it here.
[14:04:32] <ei2matrix> Hi guys, question, I did an Pdf preview, just using <object element and put it into a div to show with a modal dialog, it works perfect in chrome and ff, but course not ie8, what could be the problem? ideas?
[14:14:54] <markmax33> What is the proper syntax for for defining a multidimensional array? I want to pass it to a php file through the $.post after it is defined properly.  Do I need a nested map() function or something else like serialize?
[14:15:14] <markmax33> I have a bunch of text input boxes that all feed into a multidimensional array for processing in a PHP file:   <input type="text" size="4" value="" name="floor_areas[0][5]"> <input type="text" size="4" value="" name="floor_areas[1][5]"> <input type="text" size="4" value="" name="floor_areas[2][5]">  <input type="text" size="4" value="" name="floor_areas[0][4]"> <input type="text" size="4" value="" name="floor_areas[1][4]"> <input t
[14:15:52] <markmax33> I used this code to get single dimensioned array:  var main_occupancy = $('input[name="main_occupancy\\[\\]"]:checked').             map(function(i, elem) { return $(this).val(); }).get();
[14:16:33] <xenaxon> how to add html to all elements in a class on dom load
[14:17:04] <alexr2> ? parseJSON
[14:17:04] <bot-t> jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[14:17:05] <xenaxon> I want to all <img> with a specific class to become <div><img></div>
[14:17:18] <xenaxon> how is that possible
[14:17:27] <alexr2> hmm that's actually the opposite
[14:17:43] <alexr2> markmax33, you can pass objects in through ajax
[14:18:07] <alexr2> (as in 2d arrays)
[14:18:51] <xenaxon> how can I add surround an <img> tag by <div></div> in jquery
[14:18:52] <alexr2> ? wrap
[14:18:53] <bot-t> .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[14:18:54] <xenaxon> is it possible?
[14:18:59] <alexr2> that's for you xenaxon
[14:19:02] <xenaxon> ok
[14:19:03] <xenaxon> thanks
[14:22:57] <markmax33> alexr2 - thanks for the help
[14:23:09] <markmax33> so I just need to google how to deal with a 2d array in ajax
[14:23:18] <markmax33> and look for some examples to copy?
[14:25:11] <gnarf> markmax33: ummm
[14:25:18] <jm2k> Any recommendations for jQuery locale plugins?
[14:25:29] <gnarf> markmax33: most server sides process that name="base[0][1]" format
[14:25:44] <markmax33> yes gnarf
[14:25:53] <markmax33> that's what I have
[14:25:59] <gnarf> you should be able to just serialize that form
[14:26:10] <gnarf> and get something to be used as data in an ajax request
[14:26:33] <markmax33> yeah I'll use the $.post after i define it correctly
[14:27:25] <gnarf> serialize can take those inputs and give you a string back that can be used as the data of an ajax call
[14:27:41] <gnarf> ?serialize
[14:27:42] <bot-t> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[14:28:05] <markmax33> okay what about .serializeArray()?
[14:28:40] <gnarf> serializeArray() gives you an array back with name/value objects
[14:29:01] <gnarf> its not as useful
[14:29:06] <markmax33> all my info is integers
[14:29:10] <markmax33> k
[14:29:46] <gnarf> markmax33: i guess i don't understand what you're trying to do entirely
[14:30:03] <markmax33> I have a 4X4 matrix
[14:30:12] <markmax33> or text input boxes
[14:30:19] <gnarf> $("#inputsContainer").serialize() + "&" + $.param({ extraData: "yup" });
[14:31:00] <gnarf> apparently $.param can take the array output from serializeArray() too
[14:31:08] <gnarf> markmax33: thats obvious, but like what do you want to do with it?
[14:31:09] <markmax33> they are dynamically made and could really be any size 6x6, 30x3 etc
[14:31:22] <markmax33> I have a bunch of PHP stuff
[14:31:28] <markmax33> that I wrote a long time ago
[14:31:47] <gnarf> .....
[14:31:50] <markmax33> that functions off of  the mutli-dimensional array
[14:31:59] <markmax33> so I need to pass the array to the php file
[14:32:10] <markmax33> instead of posting it  though php
[14:32:21] <gnarf> you still "post it through php"
[14:32:23] <markmax33> i'm trying to post the array VIA Jquery
[14:32:32] <gnarf> you just use ajax instead of a form submit
[14:32:41] <gnarf> ?ajaxForm
[14:32:42] <bot-t> ajaxForm plugin - Full AJAX form support, including file upload capabilities. The primary methods for managing your form are ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit. - http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#download
[14:32:55] <gnarf> ^^^ thats a pretty useful plugin
[14:33:33] <gnarf> markmax33: i don't understand what the problem is...
[14:33:47] <markmax33> my question is probably very simple
[14:33:56] <gnarf> jQuery.ajax({ url: "thephp.php", data: $("#theForm").serialize(), method: "post" })
[14:34:10] <markmax33> how to transmit the 2d array from my page back to a php file
[14:34:20] <gnarf> ^^^^
[14:34:20] <markmax33> via Jquery
[14:34:23] <gnarf> ^^^^^
[14:34:51] <markmax33> http://v2.codecomply.com/master.php
[14:34:55] <markmax33> you can see it there
[14:35:19] <gnarf> no i can't cuz i haven't clicked... see ?ajaxForm or my example like 3 lines ago
[14:35:19] <bot-t> ajaxForm plugin - Full AJAX form support, including file upload capabilities. The primary methods for managing your form are ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit. - http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#download
[14:35:20] <markmax33> you gotta answer a couple questions and then a matrix appears to the user
[14:35:45] <markmax33> k let me read
[14:35:46] <markmax33> sorry
[14:37:09] <markmax33> i am not posting it through the form submit that I used to do
[14:37:27] <markmax33> I am passing variables back from the user inputs dynamically
[14:37:44] <gnarf> you're frustrating
[14:37:48] <gnarf> what does that mean
[14:37:48] <gnarf> ?
[14:37:59] <markmax33> I used to have 8 php pages
[14:38:06] <markmax33> that were all questionaires basically
[14:38:37] <markmax33> the user answers questions and then the next screen asks questions depending on the first
[14:38:43] <gnarf> i don't need the projects life story, I need you to define "passing variables back from the user inputs dynamically"
[14:39:20] <markmax33> instead of using this : form name="input1.5" action="input1.6.php" method="post" to transition between  webpages
[14:40:03] <markmax33> I am using something like this function get(){             var number = $("input[name=numbers]:checked").val();              $.post('data.php', { name: number },                  function(output){                   $('#input15').html(output).show();                    building_height_change();                 });                };
[14:40:34] <gnarf> sure
[14:40:39] <gnarf> that data object in the $.post
[14:40:45] <gnarf> can be the output from form.seralize()
[14:40:50] <gnarf> to make it even easier
[14:40:54] <markmax33> but the problem is how to get a multi dimensinal  arra
[14:40:56] <markmax33> y
[14:41:01] <markmax33> defined and postse
[14:41:05] <markmax33> posted
[14:41:15] <gnarf> .ajaxSubmit from that plugin does a lot of that for you
[14:41:18] <markmax33> k
[14:41:24] <gnarf> you could still have the "html form" working
[14:41:47] <gnarf> and just form.ajaxSubmit({ success: function( output ) { .... });
[14:42:36] <markmax33> i'll read up on that plugin...thanks for  putting up with my rookieness
[14:42:40] <gnarf> and it will submit the current values in the form just like the user had pressed submit, only it will be an AJAX request instead of the browser changing pages
[14:43:00] <gnarf> so you can parse your response however you want to
[14:43:16] <markmax33> k

[14:58:59] <Rndnick> hi
[14:59:12] <Rndnick> JQuery works fine on FireFox
[14:59:20] <Rndnick> But on IE, it gives issues
[14:59:25] <Rndnick> Menu's simple not working etc
[14:59:30] <Rndnick> What can be the reason of this ?
[15:02:29] <tw2113> IE is the issue :)
[15:03:04] <Rndnick> useless
[15:03:07] <gnarf> ?demo
[15:03:08] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:03:33] <Rndnick> hard to reproduce
[15:03:38] <Rndnick> cause it's on server
[15:03:44] <Rndnick> much of the javascript uses server
[15:03:52] <gnarf> Rndnick: stop right there...
[15:04:09] <gnarf> Rndnick: we are not psychic debuggers
[15:04:35] <Rndnick> im just asking for known issues with IE vs firefox
[15:04:45] <gnarf> Rndnick: we can not stare into your mind and see the code bits flowing through the ether and guess at what of millions of possible reasons your code doesn't run in IE
[15:04:53] <Rndnick> so ?
[15:05:00] <Rndnick> you seem bored
[15:05:11] <Rndnick> im just asking a standard question
[15:05:14] <tw2113> there are infinite differences between IE and Firefox
[15:05:24] <biberao> please help
[15:05:25] <Rndnick> infinite...
[15:05:30] <gnarf> Rndnick: ask google and start reading...
[15:05:33] <Rndnick> ok i will just google
[15:05:34] <gnarf> Rndnick: there are a million
[15:05:45] <biberao> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/pkz84K72tS7k8zwgL8qM/ <- correct?
[15:05:53] <gnarf> Rndnick: but realistically
[15:06:01] <gnarf> Rndnick: DEBUGGING your code will probably solve the issue
[15:06:09] <Rndnick> realistically, stfu
[15:06:13] <Rndnick> seriously
[15:06:23] <gnarf> no
[15:06:43] <tw2113> you're basically saying "i have a problem. Solve it please"
[15:07:08] <Rndnick> trol
[15:07:13] <tw2113> realist
[15:07:20] <Rndnick> trol
[15:07:27] <gnarf> Rndnick: debugging an IE issue is like real work for most of us in this channel
[15:07:32] <tw2113> if you're going to call me a troll, at least use 2 L's
[15:07:33] <Rndnick> trolls
[15:07:36] <gnarf> Rndnick: it happens - there are great tools
[15:07:56] <gnarf> Rndnick: use something like browserstack if you have to
[15:08:10] <gnarf> it comes with some decent debuggers in the worst envrionments out there
[15:08:24] <gnarf> the best way to solve the problem is to RECREATE it from scratch on jsfiddle
[15:08:33] <gnarf> and once you can see the problem - you can solve it
[15:08:42] <gnarf> Rndnick: now stop trolling me
[15:09:13] <tw2113> us
[15:09:15] <tw2113> :)
[15:10:37] <gnarf> now give me your money before you can cross this bridge....
[15:10:54] <tw2113> if we don't get no tolls, we don't eat no rolls
[15:11:11] <gnarf> silly....
[15:11:54] <tw2113> mm rolls
[15:18:08] <klawd> hi!
[15:18:15] <klawd> f.easing[i.animatedProperties[this.prop]] is not a function im getting this a lot lately
[15:18:19] <klawd> any idea why?
[15:19:24] <nlogax> other than what you already said?
[15:21:31] <xec> klawd: when is it happening? what is not working? what are you trying to do? can you reproduce it in a jsfiddle?
[15:22:18] <xec> also, why is the sky black with white dots?
[15:23:54] <klawd> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/EyhDZ/
[15:24:18] <klawd> it's not gonna work on the fidlles though i guess ;)
[15:24:27] <klawd> s/fidlles/fiddles/
[15:24:43] <dabear> klawd: include the easing plugin in the html view
[15:24:52] <dabear> <script src="..."
[15:25:02] <klawd> dabear: can't scroll there anyway
[15:25:13] <klawd> page is 100% x 100%
[15:25:22] <xec> what
[15:25:44] <styol> gnarf: nice work on color :)
[15:25:48] <xec> klawd: try dabear's suggestion ;)
[15:25:55] <klawd> anyway, i'd give it a shot but where would i find the easing plugin?
[15:26:07] <klawd> im pretty new to jquery
[15:27:41] <gnarf> styol: i need to put out b2 already
[15:28:09] <gnarf> klawd: console.log( jQuery.easing )
[15:28:27] <gnarf> klawd: there is a good chance one of your "easing" functions is not a function....
[15:28:31] <gnarf> also
[15:28:35] <styol> gnarf: what sort of additional deliciousness is in b2, just out of curiousity
[15:28:50] <klawd> AHAHA
[15:28:51] <klawd> ok
[15:28:55] <klawd> now i not what you guys meant
[15:28:56] <klawd> thanks :D
[15:29:07] <gnarf> if you put chromes script debugger on the purple pause klawd - you can catch the error and look at i.animatedPropertes[this.prop]
[15:29:23] <gnarf> perhaps you are trying to use an easing function not defined
[15:29:42] <gnarf> styol: no functional changes, just different internal storage...
[15:32:18] <styol> gnarf: Ah gotcha. It is nice to hear it's active. As always, keep up the good work :)
[15:32:43] <styol> gnarf: hows the game coming along?
[15:42:05] <imanc> how can i prevent a form submission from occuring?
[15:42:25] <imanc> e.preventDefault() and return false don't seem to have any impact, unless i'm missing something
[15:49:37] <mightym> hey guys, I've to look for a li with a unique attributes value and check its slot, f.e. that i get a result like its the 9th li of this list. someone a hint for me how to solve that?
[15:52:09] <klawd> most browsers can't handle background-gradient transitions yet
[15:52:10] <klawd> can jquery?
[15:52:45] <f0rkn1ght> klawd, *Most can yes
[15:52:51] <f0rkn1ght>  Not all though )
[15:53:04] <klawd> ey, wha?
[15:53:11] <klawd> can jquery do it?
[15:53:14] <klawd> im just gonna try now
[15:53:17] <gnarf> styol: sorry, been working on writing an epic pull request summary
[15:53:39] <styol> gnarf: no worries at all
[15:53:51] <subbyyy> anyone got any tips to optimize for ie dom traversal? i have code with traverses a large tree view to highlight the nodes and works great on all browsers but laggy on IE
[16:05:33] <gnarf> styol: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/731
[16:05:33] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by gnarf37 (2m, 28s ago): 1.8 effects
[16:06:55] <gloomer> subbyyy depends, do you have an example of how your doing it
[16:07:22] <gnarf> styol: like i said, epic pull request description
[16:07:23] <gnarf> :)
[16:07:35] <styol> gnarf: yeah that is definitely rather epic hah, me still reading
[16:07:49] <styol> sounds delicious so far

[16:12:12] <Hopsy> anyone who can help me with math?
[16:12:26] <Hopsy> I stuck in a big math problem -.-
[16:15:31] <gloomer> subbyyy, are you constantly having to re-traverse or is it a one time deal
[16:16:02] <subbyyy> constantly, since those functions get called on keyboard up/down arrows
[16:19:08] <gloomer> are you using jstree?
[16:20:13] <subbyyy> gloomer, nope, its a custom treeview built from backbone
[16:20:37] <subbyyy> since i can add/remove new items dynamically with validation/schema
[16:20:41] <subbyyy> so its a bit more complicated
[16:21:38] <gloomer> it really depends on how/what your searching for when traversing the tree
[16:21:54] <gloomer> but you could hold a partial tree object in memory and do the traversal there and use faster selectors on the dom
[16:22:15] <subbyyy> i see
[16:22:38] <gloomer> or use a partial tree to cut down the search space for the more ineffecitent selectors
[16:22:52] <subbyyy> how do i go about doing a "partial tree" object
[16:24:04] <gloomer> by partial tree I just meant the first few levels of your tree
[16:24:18] <subbyyy> ah, i see
[16:24:31] <subbyyy> well it already always in context
[16:24:34] <subbyyy> since i dont start from root
[16:24:43] <subbyyy> thats what prevView i pass in the method is for
[16:24:48] <subbyyy> i cache the previous selected view
[16:25:11] <subbyyy> so that i dont traverse the whole tree, just starting from the previous point
[16:25:47] <subbyyy> works great on new browsers, just sluggish on ie =/
[16:25:50] <subbyyy> ie7/8
[16:25:59] <subbyyy> which is kinda annoying
[16:27:45] <gloomer> well depending on the problem you might be able to cut your search space down which will solve the problem
[16:28:04] <subbyyy> i see, ill try and tink about it some more, thanks!
[16:28:06] <subbyyy> think*
[16:28:58] <gloomer> that and cache as much as possible
[16:29:03] <gloomer> ie7/8 are just slow for dom access
[16:30:18] <subbyyy> yeah just noticed :(
[16:38:13] <sqwk> What's the best way to sort options in a select alphabetically
[16:40:59] <coolguy69> can jquery execute the javascript on  a page?
[16:45:01] <ParadoxQuine> hey, i'd like to enhance my draggable div so that, once the user starts dragging, they can't stop until they successfully place it on a droppable. even if they mouseup, itll stick to the cursor
[16:45:25] <ParadoxQuine> is there a way to tie in to the draggable events to facilitate this?
[16:45:54] <astropirate> ParadoxQuine, that sounds annoying
[16:46:16] <astropirate> why dont' you make it go back to its origional position if not placed in the right place
[16:46:30] <ParadoxQuine> :P it's for a game, so i need that to facilitate the game rules (which says once you pick a card up, you can't put it back down)
[16:46:48] <ParadoxQuine> (unless its on a valid spot)
[16:48:09] <johnkpaul> ParadoxQuine: I'm pretty sure you can return false from one of the events in a droppable
[16:48:12] <johnkpaul> to prevent dropping
[16:50:10] <ParadoxQuine> i tried returning false from dragstop but that just made it no longer draggable after it was dropped
[16:51:15] <johnkpaul> the droppable has an event called "drop"
[16:51:59] <johnkpaul> attach a handler to that event, and return false, and it should stop the dropping
[16:52:09] <johnkpaul> whether or not that cancels the dragging as well, I don't know, but I don't think so
[16:53:13] <ParadoxQuine> ill fiddle with that for a min. from what i've been trying, that prevents it from being dropped "on" the droppable, but it can still end the drag near it or elsewhere
[16:55:34] <johnkpaul> oh I see, you don't just want to stop a drop on a droppable, you want to stop it from reverting too
[16:55:51] <johnkpaul> hmm, you're going to have to dig into the innerds of draggable
[16:56:09] <maxARG> holaaaa
[16:57:33] <ParadoxQuine> ok
[16:57:59] <ParadoxQuine> i notice it starts/stops drags on a mousedown/mouseup by default,maybe i can override those to trigger differently
[17:03:18] <gnarf> ParadoxQuine: you'd have to extend draggable
[17:03:37] <gnarf> ParadoxQuine: and override its default mouse events
[17:03:41] <ParadoxQuine> mk, just extend and override its click handling?
[17:03:44] <ParadoxQuine> that should be pretty easy
[17:04:09] <gnarf> ParadoxQuine: make your own game.carddrag UI "widget" or something
[17:06:19] <ParadoxQuine> mk
[17:06:22] <ParadoxQuine> thx

[18:02:48] <sia77> I have two page. a.html, b.html. b.html contains 5 collapsible panels. a.html has 5 links each coresponding to each panel on b.html. Is it possible to use jquery in the following way. When I click on one of the links on a.html I get redirected to page b.html, and then the coresponding panel opens up.
[18:14:43] <Krinkle> sia77: The best solution may be without jQuery
[18:15:04] <Krinkle> sia77: e.g. if page B is in php, you can pass ?state= and then make sure that one is expanded by default
[18:15:20] <Krinkle> so all sections have style="display: none;" on page B, except that one
[18:15:51] <sia77> Krinkle: I c. That's a good idea. The page is actually in php.
[18:16:00] <Krinkle> I thought so :)
[18:16:19] <sia77> Krinkle: But are you also saying that this can no be done in jquery?
[18:16:54] <Krinkle> sure, you could have pageA link to PageB.php?section=foo and then in javascript extract "section=(.*)" from the url and then find it in the page and expand it
[18:17:05] <Krinkle> but that's slower, more fragile and will make the expand too visible
[18:17:11] <Krinkle> e.g. firs thidden and then a jump on the page
[18:17:32] <sia77> Krinkle: I c.
[18:17:39] <sia77> Krinkle: Goog point.
[18:18:16] <sia77> Krinkle: Good point.
[18:18:26] <sia77> Krinkle: Thanks for that.
[18:18:45] <Krinkle> You can also use the #hash, e.g. PageA.php link to PageB.php#section=foo, then in javascript on PageB: if ( window.location.hash.indexOf('#section=') === 0 ) { .. $('#section-' + (part of the  hash) ).slideDown(); }
[18:19:41] <Krinkle> be careful NOT to pass window.location.hash directly to $() because $() can also create HTML, so that's insecure (e.g. one could go to #<script>.</script>

[19:17:08] <onykage> is there a way to reload the js in the head?
[19:20:27] <johnkpaul> rado-: why the new name?
[19:21:04] <johnkpaul> ?getScript @onykage
[19:21:04] <bot-t> onykage, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[19:24:57] <onykage> johnkpaul: that just inserts the script same as using append() but if the script already exists and we call it then we get the action performed twice because the dom has the script called twice
[19:25:24] <johnkpaul> isn't that what "reload the js in the head" means
[19:25:26] <johnkpaul> ?
[19:25:29] <johnkpaul> you want it done twice
[19:25:30] <johnkpaul> no?
[19:25:42] <onykage> not really no
[19:26:03] <onykage> here is my issue, im adding html into the dom
[19:26:10] <onykage> the html doesnt exist at page load
[19:26:41] <onykage> and when its called the subsequent js needs to be 'loaded' at the time its called
[19:27:31] <johnkpaul> hmm, "when its called"? "subsequent js"? "at the time its called"?
[19:27:34] <onykage> when i can do that part, my issue now is removing the js from the dom or checking to see if its exists
[19:27:36] <johnkpaul> sorry, that is a very confusing sentence
[19:28:46] <onykage> if it wouldnt be overly complicated id put together an example
[19:28:48] <onykage> ok
[19:29:00] <onykage> i have html with jquery
[19:29:29] <onykage> onClick im removing html from inside a div and replacing it with new
[19:29:45] <onykage> now the new html has js actions built in
[19:29:59] <johnkpaul> "js actions"?
[19:30:10] <onykage> the js doesnt know to listen for the action of the new html because it wasnt there when it was loaded
[19:30:20] <johnkpaul> what is an action?
[19:30:23] <onykage> javascript actions
[19:30:33] <onykage> click, blur, hover
[19:31:49] <kborchers> ?on @ onykage
[19:31:49] <bot-t> onykage, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[19:31:50] <onykage> if i can get the click actions to work then the rest of it will work
[19:32:27] <johnkpaul> yeah, onykage, kborchers is right, you need to look into the use of .on()
[19:39:49] <onykage> ok riddle me this
[19:40:00] <onykage> if the style is called
[19:40:37] <onykage> and you insert html into the dom, shouldnt the css auto style the newly inserted code?
[19:45:08] <onykage> im beginning to think that my problem is not the dom its the way ive used jquery to insert/remove elements into the dom on command
[19:45:20] <onykage> .on() isnt working either
[19:46:40] <onykage> only thing that kinda works is using something like append to re-add the item when in the case of jquery, causes actions to happen once for each instance of the appended script
[19:51:57] <RPkS> johmkpaul: some how my nick got flipped around, I think I have it fixed now.
[19:54:12] <AngryAngel> Hello
[19:54:14] <AngryAngel> Is there a PHP channel?
[19:54:44] <astropirate> no
[19:54:51] <onykage> whats your php question
[19:54:54] <astropirate> AngryAngel, ##php
[19:55:16] <AngryAngel> I need some simple help
[19:55:27] <AngryAngel> But I don't have any PHP knowledge
[19:55:39] <AngryAngel> I'm sure it's very easy to solve
[19:55:52] <astropirate> well? what is your question? o_O
[19:55:55] <AngryAngel> http://wordpress.org/support/topic/problem-with-wp-reportpost-plugin?replies=2
[19:55:59] <AngryAngel> It's there
[19:56:23] <onykage> ask your question over at #wordpress
[19:56:47] <AngryAngel> I'm there so I guess I will
[19:57:49] <onykage> no to be rude but your question is vague and relates directly to a WP plugin
[19:57:55] <onykage> not*
[19:58:25] <AngryAngel> I just want to display the "plugin" on posts page
[19:58:31] <AngryAngel> Not on the main/front page
[19:58:34] <onykage> grrr im in such a zone i cant even type in english tonight..
[19:58:44] <onykage> i wasnt trying to be rude but ...
[20:00:06] <onykage> dude I would look for a plugin that lets me control what content is displayed where
[20:00:25] <AngryAngel> There are no other "report" plugins.
[20:00:29] <AngryAngel> This plugin is simple & great.
[20:00:36] <AngryAngel> It's just a matter of changing a few simple lines
[20:00:40] <onykage> only thing i know to tell you on that, they have changed wordpress so much since i used it last I wouldnt even know where to start
[20:00:40] <AngryAngel> I just don't know which ones.
[20:01:21] <onykage> im sure its more then that and probably not much in php but more in the WP libs
[20:01:25] <alexr2> AngryAngel, wordpress php isn't quite the same as your regular php.  WP has a lot of functions that  you're supposed to use to do things properly
[20:01:32] <AngryAngel> Yeah..
[20:01:49] <onykage> why i suggested you ask over at #WP
[20:02:01] <AngryAngel> I have, no responses yet :p
[20:02:12] <AngryAngel> I KNOW that there is a simple solution like I said many times before
[20:02:21] <AngryAngel> It's a matter of changing a few simple words in lines
[20:02:36] <onykage> well its been my experience with chan that those guys are flaky bunch
[20:02:37] <alexr2> haha, you think it's a simple solution, but you don't know any php  :-P
[20:03:02] <onykage> well those words are specific WP function calls mate
[20:03:09] <onykage> open the plugin up
[20:03:14] <onykage> and dig through the codex
[20:03:37] <AngryAngel> I have.
[20:03:44] <AngryAngel> Like I said before I have 0 knowledge in php
[20:03:49] <AngryAngel> Or wordpress php/functions
[20:03:53] <AngryAngel> So I have no idea what to change
[20:03:55] <onykage> like i said i havnt done anything in WP in over a year and its changed a ton since then i dont know what is depreciated and whats active anymore
[20:04:01] <AngryAngel> I found lines such as "main" and "front"
[20:04:12] <AngryAngel> So I need to edit those, but no idea what to change there
[20:04:21] <onykage> their last update broke my homesite and ive not taken the time to dig threw the changelog to see what the issue is
[20:05:19] <onykage> just periodically ask your question eventually someone will answer you or make some crude remark
[20:05:27] <AngryAngel> Yeah..
[20:05:29] <AngryAngel> http://pastebin.com/LCRAMKVC
[20:05:33] <AngryAngel> If you wanna have a look at the code..
[20:06:38] <onykage> ok dont edit this
[20:07:01] <onykage> search for a plugin that lets you manage where and how items are displayed
[20:08:36] <onykage> i dont see anything in the plugin that is setting the items location
[20:08:43] <onykage> widget or otherwise
[20:08:57] <AngryAngel> if(is_page() /*|| is_front_page() || is_home()*/ ){
[20:09:02] <AngryAngel> I think that's my issue
[20:09:04] <onykage> so there is nothing in the plugin that is changeable
[20:09:06] <onykage> no
[20:09:17] <onykage> thats a comperison
[20:09:43] <tupacshakur> Hoppy Easter friends & allies
[20:09:45] <tupacshakur> http://hoppyeaster.com
[20:10:03] <onykage> if is (This page number) or (is the front page) or (is the blog itself)
[20:10:25] <onykage> WP is dictating what and where
[20:10:28] <onykage> not that plugin
[20:10:40] <onykage> all the author did was use meta
[20:11:05] <onykage> and meta boxes are used all over wp
[20:14:31] <onykage> AngryAngel: gl .. last resort id contact the plugins author
[20:14:43] <AngryAngel> His website is gone
[21:24:12] <coldhead> well well well
[21:32:57] <jekor> Is there a way to concatenate a list of jQuery objects? For example: $.map(['a', 'b', 'c'], function (x) {return $('<div></div>').append(x);}) <- concatenate the DOM objects from this result?
[22:20:30] <forbiddenjutsu> how can i call a javascript function from jquery?
[22:21:14] <coldhead> same as you would call it without jQuery
[22:21:20] <coldhead> function_name();
[22:30:09] <ruby_on_tails> is there something wrong with $("header").css("paddingLeft", "0"); ? doesnt seem to work
[22:30:13] <forbiddenjutsu> coldhead, Im using nodejs so the function is out of scope. what can i do about that?
[22:31:52] <coldhead> make it available somehow, forbiddenjutsu
[22:31:58] <coldhead> save a reference to it
[22:32:09] <coldhead> or move it into a more general scope
[22:32:19] <coldhead> looks good to me ruby_on_tails
[22:32:24] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[22:32:50] <ruby_on_tails> i have a jquery draggable, on whose stop event i did an animate to reduce padding of an element to 0, but that happens after 1-2 seconds, why ?
[22:33:00] <ruby_on_tails> does jquery draggable keep the JS busy for that time ?
[22:37:58] <ruby_on_tails> nvm found the bug
[22:40:58] <forbiddenjutsu> if i triggered a click on <a href ="javascript : function(//update page)">click me</a> then looped through the tags would i get old values or new values?
[22:47:07] <Hereisanotherlie> do you need to use a plugin to animate color transitions?
[22:52:41] <coldhead> forbiddenjutsu: why are using something from last century like href="javascript:omg()" with something bleeding edge like node?
[22:53:00] <coldhead> inlined javascript is a headache you don't need, don't do that :)
[22:53:13] <forbiddenjutsu> coldhead, Im trying to scrape a page that uses javascript:
[22:53:22] <coldhead> oh no :(
[22:53:46] <coldhead> Hereisanotherlie: i think you do need a plugin, but there's a very good small one that gnarf wrote
[22:54:14] <coldhead> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[22:54:20] <Hereisanotherlie> coldhead: thanks!
[22:54:58] <coldhead> forbiddenjutsu: i am not sure how you would trigger that click
[22:55:06] <coldhead> i would expect to get the updated values
[22:55:11] <coldhead> but it depends how that function works
[22:55:14] <coldhead> async or otherwise
[22:55:28] <coldhead> you're in a world of pain :(
[22:55:36] <forbiddenjutsu> lol yea

[23:14:17] <_helpPlz_> where can i find more documentation regarding jqueryui?
[23:14:34] <asher^> apart from the web site?
[23:14:43] <_helpPlz_> yes?
