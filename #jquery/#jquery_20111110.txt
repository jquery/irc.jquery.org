[00:05:55] <poppiez> hi! is there a faster way to do this: http://pastie.org/2840529? thx
[00:07:10] <Eviltwin> .append(container.clone(),container.clone(),container.clone()) perhaps
[00:07:17] <Eviltwin> Actually that probably won't work
[00:08:33] <Lazzzy> Eviltwin, I thought I understood, but I am missing something still... :( http://pastie.org/2840404
[00:08:49] <coldhead> nice of you to stop by, hobs
[00:10:26] <poppiez> Eviltwin: that would be neat. anyway, I guess it's pretty solid after all. I just looked at it and thought "there must be a better way" lol :)
[00:10:40] <Eviltwin> Lazzzy: That's because I lied about how it worked
[00:10:47] <Lazzzy> haha
[00:10:55] <Eviltwin> Not on purpose
[00:10:58] <Eviltwin> I just half forgot
[00:11:10] <Lazzzy> That's okay,  I'm glad I'm not crazy!
[00:11:13] <Eviltwin> The second param to .trigger gets passed as the second arg to the event handler
[00:11:19] <beasty> morning all
[00:11:21] <Eviltwin> So .submit(function(event,data) { ...
[00:11:29] <Eviltwin> Then if(!data)
[00:11:36] <Lazzzy> cool.. easy fix!
[00:11:37] <beasty> i got this issue that a form get's submitted twice
[00:12:28] <beasty> it's with a validate->submithandler
[00:12:30] <Eviltwin> poppiez: Nothing's going to be more efficient when it runs
[00:12:50] <clear-in> nVee

[00:13:05] <clear-in> http://jsfiddle.net/B69pe/
[00:13:19] <clear-in> .submit() is not working? i dunno why
[00:13:35] <Eviltwin> *cough* http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255 *cough*
[00:14:29] <Eviltwin> clear-in: http://jsfiddle.net/B69pe/2/
[00:14:33] <Lazzzy> Eviltwin:  excuse you... and Again thank you.  It works now
[00:14:41] <Eviltwin> clear-in: Event starts at the form, not the button
[00:14:46] <Eviltwin> Lazzzy: You're welcome
[00:14:47] <Lazzzy> might get the cough checked out bud.
[00:15:03] <Eviltwin> I think I have a very reasonable goal
[00:15:23] <clear-in> oh,. thank you eviltwin
[00:15:32] <Eviltwin> *cough*

[00:44:56] <richardr> What is the best way to customise jQuery Module themes?
[00:45:30] <richardr> Should I start with just a structural base and define my own theme? Or use the base themes? Do I edit the base themes directly or create a new suffix
[01:04:44] <Whirl3d> good morning all. Can I bind any function to an element using .bind and then trigger it using .trigger or can I only bind existing events for that element?
[01:06:18] <Whirl3d> anybody out there?
[01:08:17] <TonkaTruck> zomg best example ever http://jsfiddle.net/aaron/H6VmP/
[01:08:26] <dumb_dumb> guys i want to make a button on the table list that will be used for editing data
[01:08:36] <TonkaTruck> Whirl3d: I made that 4u bro
[01:09:07] <Whirl3d> TonkaTruck, thanks checking it out now.
[01:09:34] * Whirl3d should've known better
[01:09:52] <dumb_dumb> how can i passed the id of an item if the button is click ? since there will be alot of button?
[01:10:21] <Whirl3d> I'm having problems with scope then. It appears that somehow I am unable to trigger events that I am binding to elements using local variable references to local functions.
[01:10:49] <Whirl3d> Thanks for the indepth discussion and insightful example, TonkaTruck
[01:11:27] <TonkaTruck> http://jsfiddle.net/aaron/H6VmP/ more insightful and made more relevant by referencing "current events"
[01:12:14] <dumb_dumb> any one could help me here?
[01:12:55] <TonkaTruck> Whirl3d: post an example of your problem on jsfiddle.
[01:13:41] <TonkaTruck> dumb_dumb: Pass to where?  Don't pass...observe!
[01:15:32] <dumb_dumb> Tonka Truck : usualy if using html link we can pass 1 so we can edit item with id = 1
[01:15:50] <dumb_dumb> is it possible to do that in jquery?
[01:18:35] <Aamir> dumb_dumb:  as TonkaTruck  said, pass to where?
[01:18:42] <Aamir> ask a clear question
[01:19:15] <dumb_dumb> i need to pass it to PHP so that i can fill the form with data
[01:19:19] <dumb_dumb> :D
[01:19:34] <dumb_dumb> i want to edit the data with ID = 1
[01:19:37] <Aamir> so u have many forms with many buttons ?
[01:19:51] <KingDosser> Hi all.
[01:20:05] <Aamir> KingDosser:  Hello
[01:20:15] <dumb_dumb> I have a table with many list data and edit button
[01:20:24] <KingDosser> Anyone experienced with creating plugins that could give me a bit of feedback?
[01:20:42] <Aamir> dumb_dumb:  I think you need a form per record to edit
[01:20:49] <dumb_dumb> I want to click one of those data and show a form that already filled with the data
[01:20:52] <XeruX> If I have found a link, how can I make the parent element fade out?
[01:21:18] <Aamir> XeroXer:  $('a').parent().fadeOut() ?
[01:21:19] <XeruX> <tr><td>somethign</td><td><a href="#">Link</a></td></tr>. If someone clicks on the link, I( want the tr to fade out
[01:21:40] <XeruX> $('a').parent().parent().fadeOut() then?
[01:21:53] <Aamir> XeroXer:  $('a').closest('tr').fadeOut()
[01:22:05] <TonkaTruck> dumb_dumb: shoot I was trying to answer what I thought was your first question http://jsfiddle.net/aaron/sfmNv/
[01:22:05] <XeruX> k, thx :)
[01:23:48] <dumb_dumb> form per record??? and what will the the form fill with? all of the data i want to edit? or just id?
[01:26:44] <TonkaTruck> dumb_dumb: Holy cow.  Look, bind an event to the "edit this row" thing...get the contents of the elements and put them in inputs...it's not rocket science.  Your "many of rows" question can be answered with XeruX same issue... use .closest('tr') and boom, you have context to "edit _this stuff_ event"
[01:29:20] <TonkaTruck> dumb_dumb: Your question is about "context".  When you want to get info about where things are in relation to each other see http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/tree-traversal/ it's all nicely covered.
[01:31:29] <dumb_dumb> tonka truck
[01:31:32] <dumb_dumb> thanks
[01:31:38] <dumb_dumb> I `ll read it first
[01:32:54] <TonkaTruck> dumb_dumb: I doubt you'll even need to read beyond the link I sent you...because the short descriptions pretty much cover it.
[01:33:49] <dumb_dumb> yeah i need to look for the example how to used it
[01:33:54] <dumb_dumb> cause i`m new in jq

[01:37:03] <glaksmono> anyone is here?
[01:37:12] <SargoDarya_> Hey guys, any idea on how I'd do an continous fade in and fade out so it looks kinda like blinking?
[01:37:54] <clear-in> hi.. in $.ajax{}, success: function(data) <- in data is it correct to use data.find("#myid").html() ??
[01:38:02] <glaksmono> somethign like $(iframe).contents().ready(function() { //dosomething }
[01:38:58] <glaksmono> where i'm loading the content of iframe through iframe.attr('src', 'someurl')
[01:39:01] <glaksmono> help!!!
[01:39:28] <ravenzz> SargoDarya_ jquery ui pulsate effect?
[01:40:03] <SargoDarya_> ravenzz: is it continous?
[01:40:25] <clarkbox> x
[01:40:52] <JackBauer24> SargoDarya_: http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/
[01:40:54] <ravenzz> mhm I don't think so
[01:41:04] <ravenzz> but you can loop it
[01:41:16] <JKarsrud> clear-in: sure, that works, but then why don't you just return the content from #myid in the first place?
[01:41:44] <SargoDarya_> that's the problem. I have 2 divs overlayed on top of each other with the one on top having an effect which should pulsate
[01:41:44] <JKarsrud> glaksmono: uhm, whut?
[01:42:22] <ravenzz> anyway I don't think that it is a good idea to have a such effect, it make the browser to redraw any time it is hidden/shown
[01:43:38] <SargoDarya_> it's just changing the opacity.. I don't really think that should be of any problem
[01:43:52] <ravenzz> oh k
[01:44:44] <SargoDarya_> It's not that I try to draw it in a canvas. (Which would be pretty easy I guess but that's kind of more cpu intensive)
[01:45:02] <TonkaTruck> SargoDarya_: http://jsfiddle.net/aaron/24sr5/ ha
[01:46:00] <SargoDarya_> That sure was quick. TonkaTruck++
[01:46:46] <glaksmono> i can't do something like this?
[01:46:47] <glaksmono> 			iframe.attr('src', foourl).contents().ready(function() {
[01:46:47] <glaksmono> 				console.log('foo');
[01:46:47] <glaksmono> 				console.log(iframe);
[01:46:47] <glaksmono> 			});
[01:47:19] <glaksmono> JKarsrud: above.. :(
[01:49:39] <TonkaTruck> http://jsfiddle.net/aaron/24sr5/1/ zomg dubstep disco get out
[01:49:58] <SargoDarya_> lol Tonka xD
[01:50:22] <ravenzz> :d
[01:50:40] <ravenzz> It would be better to replace fadeOut/In with fadeTo
[01:51:23] <ravenzz> so you can fadeTo 0.1 or whatever, and it will never be hidden (display:none)
[01:51:48] <SargoDarya_> Give TonkaTruck 5 minutes and there will be a dubstep plugin...
[01:52:09] <SargoDarya_> Suddenly... dubstep
[01:53:07] <TonkaTruck> I agree with ravenzz fadeTo is better.
[01:54:59] <jacky123> best markdown to use ?
[01:55:42] <TonkaTruck> jacky123: That's almost a question for the marketing department.
[01:56:02] <jacky123> where do i find them ?
[01:57:11] <jacky123> if i use one client side with JS, is it necessary to use one on the server side too ?
[01:58:09] <SargoDarya_> jacky123 what exactly are you referring to?
[01:58:26] <SargoDarya_> The only thing which runs serverside in js I know is node
[01:58:58] <jacky123> i think markdown has been implemented in many languages
[01:59:05] <TonkaTruck> jacky123: Yeah I mean they have to sort of work together because your server app will likely be parsing it either in or out...preferably in.
[01:59:08] <jacky123> perl, php, python, ruby, etc. also there are client side markdowns
[01:59:12] <SargoDarya_> Oh, yea of course
[01:59:28] <jacky123> i like the stackoverflow one which is probably wmd
[02:00:15] <ravenzz> here we go http://jsfiddle.net/Re54M/
[02:00:15] <KingDosser> Anyone experienced with creating plugins that could give me a bit of feedback?
[02:00:18] <jacky123> TonkaTruck: i think the client side one can send the HTML version straight shot to the server in the post request ? :)
[02:00:23] <ravenzz> SargoDarya_, TonkaTruck ^
[02:00:25] <ravenzz> lol
[02:02:13] <SargoDarya_> lol
[02:02:32] <xec> jacky123: the one from stackoverflow is this: http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/
[02:03:33] <jacky123> xec: do they use that server side to parse and use wmd on the client side ?
[02:03:53] <xec> well, c# is surely server side
[02:04:06] <jacky123> i dont understand why you need both. just client side should do, like we work with wysiwygs like tinymce, etc.
[02:04:25] <jacky123> what am i missing
[02:07:16] <xec> i didn't even know there was anything called markdown till you asked about it ;)
[02:07:51] <jacky123> ok
[02:08:09] <TonkaTruck> jacky123: I always thought it was best to convert markdown once when writing the data.  Do people let the client do it now?  Maybe xss isn't a thing anymore.  I haven't been keeping up.
[02:19:26] <poppiez> is it possible to split some HTML based on an offset? for example, let's say my page is 1000px in height. I know that I have some text at top offset 500px. is there any way to split the content from there?

[02:27:34] <Aamir> Chetic: with css :P
[02:27:50] <dddbmt> Hi guys. If I am making an webpage that runs through an iframe on facebook. (i.e. facebook app) - is there a way, from my iframe,  how much the parent frame (facebook) is scrolled?
[02:27:58] <deebo> if i have a jquery object that doesnt have parent wrapper like '<div>content...</div><form> ...</form><div>footer</div>', how can i effectively use .find or something on an object like this?
[02:28:08] <dddbmt> In order to show a CSS popup in the middle of the users screen, and not just in the middle of the iframe.
[02:28:27] <Aamir> dddbmt:  not sure but try scrollTop
[02:28:36] <Cork> deebo: $('<div>content...</div><form> ...</form><div>footer</div>').find should work just fine
[02:29:30] <deebo> Cork: it doesnt, ill make a jsfiddle example, sec
[02:29:35] <Trisox> or search for text
[02:29:37] <Trisox> :P
[02:29:42] <Cork> dddbmt: modern browsers block that information now days to prevent leaking private information
[02:30:01] <Trisox> $('*:contains("I am a simple string")');
[02:30:01] <Cork> deebo: opps sorry its filter not find
[02:30:01] <Trisox> http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[02:30:04] <dddbmt> Cork, that was what I was thinking. Too bad :/
[02:30:22] <Cork> deebo: find searches in children filter filter current content
[02:31:03] <deebo> hmm i need a "recursive" filter :)
[02:31:21] <Trisox> wrap it in a span :P
[02:31:23] <deebo> can i merge .filter and .find somehow?
[02:31:39] <Cork> filter should be able to handel everything thats in your selection
[02:31:49] <deebo> it wont find children of the selection
[02:31:53] <Trisox> what cork said
[02:32:39] <deebo> my case is: '<button class="a"/> <form> <button class="a"/> </form> <button class="a"/>", .find only finds the button isnide the form, and filter only finds the buttons outside the form
[02:33:46] <dddbmt> Cork, fortunately facebook gives a hand ;o) https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/FB.Canvas.getPageInfo/
[02:36:53] <Cork> deebo: hmm your right filter doesn't do a new selection so the children won't be found
[02:37:08] <Cork> as they arn't in the selection to begin with
[02:38:46] <Cork> deebo: one alternative would be to append them to a container and search from it
[02:39:05] <Cork> or use .add to combind the two selectors
[02:43:29] <ruby_on_tails> cant we animate elements added later in the DOM ?
[02:43:40] <Aamir> ruby_on_tails:  why not
[02:44:04] <ruby_on_tails> i have a weird issue, got some elements added in a jquery player, when i try to show the pause button when the play button is clicked it doesnt work
[02:44:19] <ruby_on_tails> neither does any other modification like adding a border works
[02:44:53] <ruby_on_tails> basically the pause button has a display none, and when the play button is clicked the play button should vanish and the pause button should fadeIn
[02:45:08] <ruby_on_tails> the play button vanished perfectly but the pause button isnt affected
[02:45:24] <ruby_on_tails> if i change the ID of the pause button to some element that was there originally in the DOM it works
[02:47:12] <poppiez> is it possible to split some HTML based on an offset? for example, let's say my page is 1000px in height. I know that I have some text at top offset 500px. is there any way to split the content from there?
[02:48:03] <ruby_on_tails> poppiez: you can get the position of an element in respect to the viewport
[02:48:26] <poppiez> ruby_on_tails: yeah, an element but what about a simple line of text?
[02:49:37] <ruby_on_tails> poppiez: maybe have a span tag or something in every line and then add a margin-top to the span thats offset > 500
[02:51:15] <XeruX> How do I pass an element to a function? the function is supposed to do something with the element
[02:51:34] <ruby_on_tails> XeruX: pass it as a parameter
[02:51:57] <ruby_on_tails> $("a").click(){dosomething($(this))}
[02:51:58] <XeruX> I tried myFunction($(aElement).find('.theElementWithThisClass'))
[02:52:00] <XeruX> ah
[02:52:09] <XeruX> I'm new to js :s
[02:52:14] <ruby_on_tails> np
[02:52:19] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: you forgot function there :)
[02:52:48] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: that was the function call
[02:52:48] <Cork> XeroXer: that should work
[02:52:55] <ruby_on_tails> he has to define the function outside
[02:53:05] <Cork> .click(){} << won't work
[02:53:11] <ruby_on_tails> oh
[02:53:13] <ruby_on_tails> sorry for that
[02:53:30] <ruby_on_tails> $("a").click(function(){dosomething($(this))})
[02:54:50] <johnline3> boobie on rails
[02:55:30] <ruby_on_tails> i am also pretty new to JS/Jquery :P

[03:24:12] <Clorith> I'm trying ot manipulate the output of my jQueryUI datepicker using beforeShowDay, but I've yet ot find out how to get the actual date/time integer of the date it's currently processing for
[03:24:35] <Clorith> The console output of the data just contains a ton of functions, but no values
[03:25:10] <Xotix> i think i got a blackout why does this give me null? http://jsfiddle.net/EJx9d/
[03:25:35] <ravenzz> ?demo @ Clorith
[03:25:35] <bot-t> Clorith, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:25:58] <JKarsrud> Xotix: you don't have jQuery selected as the framework in you fiddle
[03:26:02] <ravenzz> ^
[03:26:18] <Clorith> I would except it isn't actually a problem, I'm just trying to find the right function/object reference to get the value
[03:26:58] <Xotix> hmm but locally i still get []
[03:27:06] <ravenzz> so take a look at the datepicker doc
[03:27:15] <JKarsrud> Xotix: http://jsfiddle.net/beyondsanity/EJx9d/1/
[03:27:19] <JKarsrud> works, no?
[03:27:56] <JKarsrud> works here atleast
[03:28:01] <Xotix> JKarsrud: ofcourse, i just tested it. I mean locally on my machine ;) hmm, must be some stupid mistake somewhere
[03:28:20] <JKarsrud> sure, maybe you're missing document.ready?
[03:28:25] <JKarsrud> see ?ready
[03:28:25] <bot-t> .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[03:28:25] <Clorith> I have, it has documentation on what data must be returned, but not what data is supplied, and as I said the console log provides me wit ha ton of function references and n oactual data
[03:28:31] <Clorith> But there has ot be data in there somewhere
[03:28:55] <Xotix> JKarsrud: ah of course! I knew it was something simpleâ€¦thanks
[03:28:58] <clockwize> hi guys, has anyone else noticed that on facebook, if you have a chat box popup open on a page, then click a link to another page, the page refreshes, the url changes etc, but the chat box still sits over the webpage? as if it's not in the context of the page?
[03:29:06] <clockwize> how does this work?
[03:29:10] <clockwize> The only way I can think of implementing it is by having the whole site in an iframe, with the chat popups as a sibling, but then the url would never change?
[03:30:01] <JKarsrud> Xotix: you might wanna move the script to the bottom just before </body> though. Then the script loading won't block the rest of the page
[03:31:06] <Xotix> No, should be okay.
[03:31:40] <Xotix> What's better $('#navigation').children()) or $('#navigation li')?
[03:32:31] <JKarsrud> not .children
[03:32:51] <JKarsrud> not sure which ones fastest tho
[03:33:21] <ravenzz> clockwize maybe at some point they flush() so the top and the left sidebar are showed asap
[03:33:28] <Xotix> okay
[03:33:42] <ravenzz> maybe
[03:35:02] <clockwize> hmm, possibly - it doesn't even flash and come back though, it's like it never even moves
[03:35:22] <ravenzz> yep :/
[03:39:01] <FleetFox> how do i listen for <select> cancel?
[03:39:40] <FleetFox> blur and focusout is not triggered
[03:46:25] <nFFF> Hi guys, I have jQuery('#id').load, and once it has laoded I want to then do something else
[03:46:33] <nFFF> But its not waiting until the load is completed
[03:46:50] <nFFF> Its just .hide() on another element
[03:47:01] <nFFF> but its doing it straight away, its not waitng until the laod is complete
[03:47:05] <nFFF> any work around?
[03:52:12] <Xotix> is thsi a good solution? Im also doing display: none; in the css first http://pastebin.com/bkSjZ5HR
[03:52:56] <nVee> sup guys, has anyone experienced issues with delegate() and internet explorer 8?
[03:53:05] <nVee> It really just does not appear to work with dynamic content
[03:53:08] <nVee> http://jsbin.com/urijud/edit#javascript,html
[03:54:29] <XeruX> I've got a problem.. http://pastebin.com/neW6BFdh   <- I've got a for-loop which is supposed to make > 1 select-list execute a function with the current value of the variable i, but it's passing the same value of i for each select list :o
[03:58:38] <XeruX> and also, the same element-ref
[04:03:31] <SPYGAME> i have a scenario in which i'm required to check all checkboxes on click of a button, the thing is i have some of them visible and the rest hidden (for paging) but when i do jQuery('.checkboxes').attr('checked', 'checked') it only check the ones which are visible, how do i check the hidden ones, any suggestions ?
[04:04:29] <Cork> SPYGAME: that shouldn't happen
[04:04:47] <Cork> the selector will catch them as long as they are in the dom
[04:04:51] <nFFF> Guys, Im making a .load() request and one request is recieving html to parse which is fine
[04:04:56] <Cork> display status doesn't matter
[04:05:02] <nFFF> but in  different case, its recieving crazy code
[04:05:05] <nFFF> like some sort of regex
[04:05:40] <nFFF> \t<\/form>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"range dinbold\"><span>Pr
[04:05:42] <SPYGAME> Cork: it's a popup view which loads via ajax
[04:05:43] <nFFF> whats all this shit?
[04:05:55] <Cork> nFFF: thats not regex, just escaped strings
[04:06:06] <Cork> \t is the representation of tabs
[04:06:28] <XeruX> nm, I figured it out.
[04:06:42] <Cork> SPYGAME: if its replaced you can't check them
[04:06:56] <Cork> SPYGAME: cause as soon as you do .load the old content is removed
[04:07:27] <nFFF> Cork, how do I parse this data to retirev a specified element
[04:07:49] <SPYGAME> Cork: well once the ajax click loads the popup view it has all the checkboxes loaded but the due to paging some of them are visible and the rest are hidden
[04:07:50] <Cork> nFFF: you should prob fix the source instead
[04:08:11] <nFFF> Cork not possible as its a CMS
[04:08:15] <SPYGAME> Cork: so i don't think there's any replacement going on
[04:08:25] <nFFF> basically it works fine when it recievs pure html
[04:08:33] <Cork> SPYGAME: if they are hidden (display: none) your selector would work, if they are removed from the dom you can't check them at all
[04:08:34] <nFFF> but its recieving it with escaped strings
[04:08:52] <nFFF> no eval() ?
[04:08:53] <SPYGAME> Cork: even in firebug when i do jQuery('.checkboxes').length it gives me the ones that are visible
[04:09:10] <Cork> nFFF: no evil -_-'
[04:09:25] <Cork> fix the code that generates the dubble escaped strings instead
[04:09:55] <Cork> SPYGAME: then that means the one that isn't vidible isn't in the dom
[04:11:26] <Cork> SPYGAME: or alternativly they don't have that class
[04:12:56] <nFFF> Cork, it works with prototype if you eval() the response
[04:13:01] <nFFF> jsut trying to make it work in jQuery
[04:13:12] <Cork> nFFF: but shy hack around it???
[04:13:18] <nFFF> shy hack?
[04:13:20] <Cork> fix the source problem instead of working around it
[04:13:29] <Cork> the problem is that the server sends broken code
[04:13:39] <Cork> why not fix the real problem instead of working around it?
[04:15:53] <nFFF> Becuase I don't get why its sending broken code
[04:16:05] <nFFF> Could it be the difference between POST and GET
[04:16:09] <Cork> cause its escaping code that doesn't need to be escaped
[04:16:11] <Cork> no
[04:17:58] <nFFF> its Magento
[04:18:08] <nFFF> A huge eCommerce platform
[04:18:14] <nFFF> Id rather just make a hack around
[04:18:25] <nFFF> rather then turn this 5 minutes job into a few dyas fo rewriting core code
[04:20:25] <nFFF> How do I parse this code Cork
[04:20:40] <Cork> looking for a clean way
[04:23:26] <Cork> nFFF: looks like you would have to use eval there doen't look like theres any better solution in js
[04:23:29] <dagon666> how can I generate JSON string from inside js script ?
[04:23:48] <Cork> JSON.stringify(obj)
[04:23:56] <nFFF> Cork whats the jQuery for eval?
[04:23:59] <nFFF> just .eval()
[04:24:15] <Cork> nFFF: eval is part of javascript, no need to involv jquery
[04:24:25] <dagon666> Cork I read comething that it may not be supported by all browsers
[04:24:29] <Cork> var string = eval(broken_string);
[04:25:02] <Cork> ?g json2 @ dagon666
[04:25:03] <bot-t> dagon666, JSON in JavaScript - http://www.json.org/js.html
[04:25:08] <nVee> sup guys, has anyone experienced issues with delegate() and internet explorer 8?
[04:25:21] <Cork> dagon666: most modern browsers support json nativly though
[04:25:33] <Cork> nVee: define issues
[04:25:54] <nVee> Cork: It literally just not working. It works in FF but IE8 is a no go
[04:25:57] <nVee> http://jsbin.com/urijud/edit#javascript,html
[04:26:28] <nFFF> Cork, but how to integrate into the .load() function
[04:26:44] <dagon666> Should I include all files or only json.js/json2.js ?
[04:26:50] <Cork> nFFF: you can't you would have to use $.get and escape it before you call .html
[04:27:00] <Cork> sorry *unescape it
[04:27:35] <Cork> dagon666: ie7+, opera, firefox, chrome and wafari supports it nativly
[04:27:40] <Cork> dagon666: do you really need it?
[04:27:46] <Cork> *safari
[04:28:52] <dagon666> I suppose noe
[04:29:13] <nVee> has anyone been able to use the jquery ui dialog as a replacement for a js alert?
[04:29:25] <Cork> sure
[04:29:34] <Cork> they won't block the js code though
[04:33:47] <derppy> What would be the best way to remove an element if it's the last element within it's parent?
[04:35:20] <ravenzz> $('#parent :last-child').reamove()
[04:35:29] <ravenzz> $('#parent :last-child').remove()
[04:35:49] <derppy> ravenzz: Would need to remove hr-element if it's the last element in a div.
[04:41:47] <ravenzz> derppy $('div hr:last-child').remove();
[04:45:14] <zfkevin> Hi we are using jqgrid to show a grid
[04:46:02] <zfkevin> we have sql like  select concat('firstname', ' ' , 'lastname') as fullname
[04:46:14] <zfkevin> Now we want to filter on the fullname
[04:46:54] <zfkevin> but that doesnt work. Is there anyone who knows how to solve this ?
[04:48:14] <beasty_> ok this is weird
[04:48:52] <nVee> can you use a js variable instead of a dom element for the jquery ui dialog?
[04:49:25] <nVee> I want my dialog to work more like alert so for instance $(varName).dialog() and output whatever the varName string text was
[04:51:12] <Cork> nVee: $('<div/>').dialog()
[04:51:31] <Cork> that is
[04:51:33] <nVee> Cork: But how will I pass the string it should contain to it?
[04:51:42] <Cork> nVee: $('<div/>').html(varName).dialog()
[04:51:46] <nVee> ahhhhh
[04:51:53] <nVee> well played :P
[04:52:21] <nVee> Cork: Iv'e never seen someone use <div/>. What does that do?
[04:53:23] <crab> it's like saying <div></div>, but shorter.
[04:55:55] <beasty_> mm first time the element show on his position, second time it shows outside the maindiv and when i disable the 'position' and re-enable it with firebug
[04:56:00] <beasty_> the element is at his place
[04:56:02] <beasty_> any clue ?
[04:58:30] <nFFF> Cork, Im in a pickle
[04:58:43] <nFFF> I want to get antoher page, and return only an element from that page
[04:58:48] <nFFF> once I have parced the JSON object
[04:58:57] <nFFF> It returns a JSON object
[04:59:34] <crab> ok, and?
[04:59:46] <nFFF> I dont knwo which function to use
[05:00:02] <nFFF> I was using .load() which worked fine until it was apssed a JSON
[05:00:12] <nFFF> now with .get() it returns the whole page
[05:00:16] <nFFF> not just the elemtn I want
[05:01:53] <crab> nFFF: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[05:08:13] <enoch> hi all
[05:09:00] <enoch> im making a little chat using jquery, it works but i want my div to autoscroll down when an user sends a message. how can i do it?
[05:10:15] <tomasm-> hi, is there a point before the page is loaded (document.ready) where i can still call jquery on dom elements? i would prefer things happen before they are rendered/seen....it gets annoying that things jump around as they are altered by jquery
[05:11:17] <tomasm-> $(document).ready() seems too late
[05:12:34] <frankstallone> IIRC browsers load pages top down ltr -- in that case you'd have to put your JS in the header not in the footer like most do for a fast response -- then again, if the HTML isn't loaded by the browser, how can jQuery do anything with it?
[05:12:37] <nFFF> Cork, not sure how that works
[05:12:45] <nFFF> As the response is a JSON object
[05:12:52] <nFFF> your not actually gt an object
[05:13:03] <nFFF> your ending a request which repsond with an object?
[05:13:30] <nFFF> i.e. getJSON('/blah.json');
[05:13:44] <nFFF> will it work i.e. getJSON(/blah.html')
[05:13:49] <nFFF> oh wait nvmd
[05:14:45] <nFFF> Ok so getJSON returns the whole object
[05:14:48] <nFFF> I need aprt of it
[05:15:04] <tomasm-> frankstallone, the difference is that each element and the whole 'document' are 'ready' at different times, if the page loads slow, the jquery will noticeably load after everything is visible
[05:22:06] <tomasm-> anyone know if i can use on() or live() for an object when it's ready/loaded, ie just to call some code on it? not associated with a specific event other than it being ready
[05:26:17] <Chetic> what's the point of .on()/.delegate()? is it to be able to add your own delegates?
[05:27:01] <tomasm-> Chetic, supposedly on() will auto-bind an event to elements even if they arent in the dom quite yet, such as with ajax
[05:27:38] <apan> Regarding deferred promise, should I use "return def.resolve()" or "def.promise()" in this case: http://jsfiddle.net/keBGf/
[05:29:27] <Chetic> tomasm-: supposedly?
[05:31:07] <barfoo365> I have a jquery animation at http://jsfiddle.net/jkHj9/ that works fine, but depending on what is going on on my page the two animations sometimes start and finish at different times.  Can anyone see a way of resolving that?
[05:31:33] <tomasm-> Chetic, its what the docs say, i dont have first hand experience
[05:33:01] <dddbmt> hi guys. Currently I am loading a file through ajax that returns a bunch of HTML put into my DOM. Is it possible to make it return JSON instead, and where the JSON object contains the HTML + some other thing I want to return ?
[05:37:46] <nVee> is there another function besides delegate I can use for jquery 1.6?
[05:37:58] <nVee> I cannot get delegate() to work in ie8
[05:38:12] <Cork> delegate works just fine
[05:38:28] <nVee> Can I provide you with my code?
[05:38:31] <nVee> :)
[05:38:32] <Cork> what happens for you?
[05:38:39] <Chetic> is there any reason to use .on() instead of .click() for a click event?
[05:39:24] <Cork> Chetic: on is just a shorthand
[05:40:49] <nVee> Cork: http://jsbin.com/evotuz/edit#javascript,html
[05:41:12] <nVee> it event just does not work
[05:41:20] <nVee> in FF it works perfectly but IE8 no go
[05:41:29] <Cork> if course it doens't thers no items on the page
[05:41:35] <Cork> *ofcource
[05:41:44] <Morkel> what is a good way to debug javascript? I am unhappy with firebug and chrome inspector
[05:41:59] <nVee> Cork: I just pasted my sample code for delegate there
[05:42:01] <Cork> Morkel: there isn't really any other way
[05:42:18] <Cork> nVee: ya but nothing about the structure it trys to work on
[05:42:32] <Cork> nVee: that jsbin is no better then a pastebin.com link
[05:42:53] <tomoyuki28jp> Is there any recommendation of a placeholder plugin?
[05:43:12] <Cork> tomoyuki28jp: placeholder?
[05:43:34] <Morkel> When i call method xy and delete this method but forget to delete the call. firebug dont show me this simple error
[05:44:19] <tomoyuki28jp> Cork: The emulator plugin of the html5 placeholder. Or are you talking about the name of a specific plugin?
[05:45:04] <Cork> aha your talking about input fields
[05:45:29] <Cork> i think there is one, don't remember the name though
[05:45:31] <dnsdds> When connecting between several sortables, how can I select the new sortable where the item was put into within the stop event?
[05:45:48] <tomoyuki28jp> Cork: thanks for trying to help me out.
[05:45:56] <barfoo365> I have a jquery animation at http://jsfiddle.net/jkHj9/ that works fine, but depending on what is going on on my page the two animations sometimes start and finish at different times.  Can anyone see a way of resolving that?
[05:49:21] <nFFF> when recieving a JSON
[05:49:32] <nFFF> can I just do obj.layers
[05:53:16] <dnsdds> Can anyone help me?
[06:03:25] <Xotix> How can i make a  var persistent for a page reload?
[06:04:08] <Cork> Xotix: only way it so store it in the cookie or the new html5 storage
[06:04:29] <Xotix> hmm ok
[06:09:19] <hap_> hello hackers. I would like to know how can i find the official documentation about $.fn
[06:10:04] <quicksilver> hap_: I don't think there is any. jQuery doesn't have source documentation as such.
[06:10:13] <quicksilver> although it has some comments and it's very readable code for the most part.
[06:10:27] <quicksilver> $.fn is the namespace which contains all the methods which end up on jQuery objects.
[06:12:41] <hap_> i've found that $.fn is a alias to the its prototype.
[06:13:07] <nnull> Guys, im a little confused about in regards to the reference in delay api documentation "to delay execution of the next item in the queue." -- items in the queue.. different functions seem to skip this queue altogether.
[06:13:29] <hap_> prototype, the prototype js?
[06:13:32] <tomasm-> anyone familiar with the event.create plugin that adds a 'create' event for dom items?
[06:14:08] <Clorith> is there a version overview for jQueryUI of when certain events or functions were introduced ?
[06:17:07] <tomasm-> is there something inherently wrong with placing dom-manipulating code outside of a $(document).ready() ? is there an issue with IE maybe?
[06:18:34] <Clorith> tomasm-, id you don't have it inside that, it'll trigger the code when it reads it, instead of waiting for the DOM to be built first
[06:18:44] <Clorith> tomasm-: No DOM built means nothing for the code to itneract with
[06:19:31] <Jarod_> Hi there
[06:19:42] <Jarod_> I got a question regarding jQuery 1.7
[06:20:07] <Jarod_> I saw we cannot use the live() event anymore... but I need a dynamic event handle like live()
[06:20:09] <tomasm-> k..... im just trying to find a way to run query so when a page is slow to load, i dont see a bunch of stuff jumping around from jquery.... maybe worth diagnosing the slowness...hmmm
[06:20:20] <tomasm-> Jarod_, .on() ?
[06:20:29] <Jarod_> .on() doesn't seem to be dynamic...
[06:20:35] <Jarod_> so if I add new elements in the page
[06:20:41] <Jarod_> then these new elements are not binded :(
[06:20:50] <Clorith> tomasm-: If you have it in the (document).ready it shouldn't do anythign before the page is loaded any way
[06:21:32] <Xotix> if i have a url liek that www.xx.com/xaax/xx?as=dd etc. how can i get aa with jquery?
[06:22:23] <Clorith> Really? There's no .live in 1.7?
[06:22:35] <Clorith> Good thing I read that BEFORE updating right now, heh
[06:22:44] <Jarod_> Xotix : you don't need jQuery... use match() on window.location.href
[06:22:59] <Jarod_> Clorith: there is live() but it's highly recommended to use .on()
[06:23:32] <Clorith> What are the benefits of .on as opposed to .live, and does it function i nthe sme way and take the same arguments so a quick and dirty replace all would be enough?
[06:24:05] <tomasm-> Jarod_, live() seems to be dead.... i cant get it to do anything
[06:24:08] <Jarod_> they explain that in a straight way in the live() documentation: http://api.jquery.com/live/
[06:24:15] <Xotix> thanks
[06:24:28] <Clorith> All right, thanks =)
[06:24:59] <Jarod_> So I guess I will call the on() after adding new elements into the DOM :)
[06:25:14] <tomasm-> Jarod_, on() doesnt work as expected, not with new elements
[06:25:22] <tomasm-> at least not for me
[06:25:34] <Clorith> Blergh, I'll ahve to do some rewriting it seems
[06:26:17] <joikus> morning
[06:26:57] <tomasm-> Jarod_, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8021436/jquery-1-7-turning-live-into-on
[06:27:10] <barfoo365> I have a jquery animation at http://jsfiddle.net/jkHj9/ that works fine, but depending on what is going on on my page the two animations sometimes start and finish at different times.  Can anyone see a way of resolving that?
[06:27:36] <tomasm-> Jarod_, although that seems to defeat the purpose of live() anyway i think
[06:28:17] <Jarod_> ok thanks tomasm- =
[06:28:22] <tomasm-> $(document).on('event','selector', function)
[06:30:32] <tomasm-> hmmm stll doesnt fire
[06:30:54] <Xotix> Jarod i don't know regex very good but how can i select an /? if i do // im doing an comment.
[06:31:13] <Jarod_> nevermind tomasm-, I'll bind the event after insertion...
[06:31:25] <Jarod_> \/
[06:31:30] <Jarod_> you should read the documentation...
[06:32:10] <tomasm-> Xotix, escape special characters with a \
[06:33:58] <nnull> i retract my previous comment concerning delay api.
[06:34:09] <BinaryMaster> Question: I am trying to build a drag and drop interface where the user can drag a container to a "desktop" like area then drag "pages" onto the new container problem I have is when I try to drag things to the new container it doesn't work I am guessing that is because they were not in the dom when the java script loaded so how do I fix that?
[06:35:03] <Xotix> tomasm: im an idiot thanks
[06:35:18] <rockfruit> A link:  <a class="specification">...  gets event trapped by $(".specification").click(){function()} - I update the page, but I want to stop the browser from following the link.  return false doesn't work.  how can I do this?
[06:36:13] <Jarod_> rockfruit: function(event) { event.preventDefault(); }
[06:36:18] <Jarod_> (cf the documentation)
[06:36:42] <barfoo365> How do i get this http://jsfiddle.net/CNaCP/ to run the function after the first one is complete?
[06:36:42] <rockfruit> that's clearer than return false - thanks
[06:40:33] <BinaryMaster> Question: I am trying to build a drag and drop interface where the user can drag a container to a "desktop" like area then drag "pages" onto the new container problem I have is when I try to drag things to the new container it doesn't work I am guessing that is because they were not in the dom when the java script loaded so how do I fix that?
[06:44:25] <clear-in> hi.. i am having trouble with autocompleter. im using struts2 and the json plugin returns like this {"city":null,"cityList":null,"jsonMap":{5517:"Guasdualito, Venezuela"},"search":"asd"}
[06:45:08] <clear-in> i notice that in regular return from a json is enclose of []. is there a way i do?
[06:45:12] <clear-in> i can do*
[06:45:34] <rockfruit> Is it possible to update the GET parameters of the URL (so the ?test=yes URL bar of the browser changes) without letting the browser refresh the page?
[06:46:07] <rockfruit> clear-in, can use $().first
[06:46:14] <rockfruit> or something very nearly like it
[06:47:10] <clear-in> rockfruit. i dont get what you mean. can you give example?
[06:47:52] <rockfruit> clear-in if I understand you look at http://api.jquery.com/first/
[06:48:55] <rockfruit> clear-in, I understood you wrong - the json will surround with [] if it is a list - that is fine - what do you want?
[06:49:41] <clear-in> yes.. i am expecting to have a list return.
[06:50:38] <clear-in> $.ajax({ url: "geojson.jsp", dataType: "json", data: { maxRows: 12, search: request.term },
[06:50:38] <clear-in> 					success: function( data ) {
[06:50:39] <clear-in> 						alert(123)},
[06:50:39] <clear-in>                                error: function() {
[06:50:39] <clear-in>                                      alert(1) }
[06:50:39] <clear-in> });
[06:51:05] <clear-in> thats the code. it alway fallin in error.
[06:51:31] <clear-in> i dunno why so i guess its because of the json format?
[06:53:17] <BinaryMaster> JSON looks good
[06:53:48] <nFFF> clear-in, use getJSON >
[06:55:13] <clear-in> i will try nFFF
[06:55:40] <Haraldson> isn't .data('foo') supposed to be able to fetch values from HTML, like data-foo="bar" ?
[06:56:14] <danzik17> Haraldson: if it's the first time that piece of data is being accessed - yes.
[06:57:21] <Haraldson> and after that first time, it's moved to $.cache or whereever?
[06:58:35] <danzik17> Haraldson: the key is populated with the initial data yes.
[06:59:37] <Haraldson> I only get undefined values, strange. there's no typos her

[07:13:50] <csnew> sorry to dissapoint
[07:13:57] <TheMoo> lol
[07:13:58] <context> hahaha
[07:14:11] <TheMoo> I posted my question @ the forums:
[07:14:11] <TheMoo> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/bug-ui-sortable-list-fires-receive-event-for-nested-lists-and-its-parent-s
[07:14:12] <context> when im 16 or 20 ill buy my own hores
[07:14:15] <csnew> probably wrong channel ;)
[07:14:33] <context> csnew: found that site yesterday, absolutely love it
[07:14:35] <TheMoo> ;)
[07:14:37] <csnew> when I turn 15 Ill try that as well
[07:14:49] <djQuery> anyone got a demo of using the jqueryui grid with a local datastore
[07:14:49] <TheMoo> Can you guys help with my question?
[07:15:05] <csnew> TheMoo: looking at your q
[07:15:09] <TheMoo> Ty
[07:15:16] <context> jqueryui has a grid ?
[07:15:31] <djQuery> http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/10/state-of-the-jquery-ui-grid/
[07:15:52] <Xotix> what's wrong with that? $('#navigation a')?
[07:15:54] <csnew> context: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/34246941/Grid
[07:16:09] <context> oh wow. nice
[07:16:11] <csnew> TheMoo: jsfiddle is taking forever to load ....
[07:16:18] <TheMoo> ok
[07:16:32] <TheMoo> im not in a hurry
[07:18:55] <nFFF> Anyone know of any good 360 product viewer plugins?
[07:19:08] <csnew> TheMoo: oh ok. Then ill bookmark it and check it over the weekend
[07:19:10] <csnew> ;)
[07:19:41] <TheMoo> :(
[07:20:07] <TheMoo> That's fine, thanks for the help :)
[07:20:10] <djQuery> nFFF: thought all of those were flash,
[07:20:12] <csnew> TheMoo: I dont think it is a bug
[07:20:21] <djQuery> or realy cutom canvas
[07:20:21] <csnew> TheMoo: it is just a case of propagation
[07:20:32] <TheMoo> no the thing is
[07:20:41] <TheMoo> is that the TOP UL get's the event first
[07:20:49] <TheMoo> not the one that is actually receiving it
[07:20:58] <TheMoo> i tried the stopPropagation already
[07:21:29] <csnew> TheMoo: oh ok
[07:21:38] <csnew> TheMoo: lets take a closer look...
[07:22:33] <TheMoo> thnx :)
[07:23:55] <xckpd7> how do plugins work in conjunction with jQuery.noConflict? would they just work the same, should I put them before using jQuery.noConflict?
[07:28:35] <context> xckpd7: they should work just fine if designed properly
[07:28:51] <context> xckpd7: doesn't matter what order.
[07:29:06] <context> if you need noConflict id probably do it right off the bat
[07:30:21] <Techdeck> this might be a little off topic, but did any of you ever host an ajax based application off amazon? I have my servers somewhere else and was wondering how can I host the static files (.js/.php/.css etc) on amazon without having cross site issues?
[07:31:41] <TheMoo> csnew: Was I right?
[07:32:20] <context> techdeck: most js is hosted at cdn's now
[07:33:25] <Techdeck> but how do I go about calling my server using ajax?
[07:33:32] <Techdeck> the server itself is hosted elsewhere
[07:33:58] <dv310p3r> I've got someone requesting that I build them a JSONP object that'll respond to their JSONP call? Can someone point me in the right direction.
[07:35:16] <smplstk> dv310p3r: that's probablly going to involve more than just front-end work
[07:35:33] <smplstk> dv310p3r: PHP?
[07:36:03] <dv310p3r> smplstk, right, I can build a json object without issue. Yes, it's PHP. I'm just not sure I understand the JSONP part. I've built JSON objects and accessed them, etc... before.
[07:36:25] <iateadonut> i've got a loop that is cycling through four pictures, fading them in and out.  the basic string that causes the fade-in, fade-out is:
[07:36:25] <iateadonut> $("#SlideshowImages a img").show("fade", {}, speed1).delay(speed2).hide("fade", {}, speed3, function(){  loop...	 );     }
[07:36:56] <iateadonut> wondering how i can write another function which finds and stops the animation on mouseover.
[07:38:01] <smplstk> dv310p3r: this sums it up semi decently: http://web.onassar.com/blog/2009/07/25/jsonp-vs-json-amazing-for-apis/
[07:40:40] <Techdeck> context?
[07:41:08] <TheMoo> did i just kill csnew with my question...
[07:41:32] <smplstk> dv310p3r: the basic difference between json and jsonp is that jsonp allows for cross-domain json requests.
[07:41:50] <csnew> TheMoo: haha nah, went to get some coffee
[07:41:57] <jankidudel> After submitting form  , response is put into <iframe , with <form target='framename',  />  ,then I want to copy  response from it and  insert into another div.. Problem -> $('form submit')....  { /* DOM acions */ }  occurs before actual response is got., and NO content exist to COPY it. Any hellp ?
[07:42:00] <smplstk> so, you're essentially building an api that other developers can tap into.
[07:42:01] <dv310p3r> smplstk, Thanks a milion
[07:42:01] <csnew> TheMoo: we 14 year old kids need coffee too
[07:42:21] <smplstk> dv310p3r: this is also a good overview: http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/
[07:42:34] <smplstk> (even has some basic php example code)
[07:42:56] <TheMoo> csnew: Does it seem like a legitimate problem though?
[07:43:54] <csnew> TheMoo: hummm, it does in a way
[07:43:59] <TheMoo> Good :)
[07:44:04] <TheMoo> that makes me happy actually
[07:44:08] <csnew> TheMoo: but it is something that I am sure when it was developed was thought of
[07:44:22] <csnew> TheMoo: you know what I mean?, not something that would go unnnoticed for all this time
[07:44:51] <TheMoo> csnew: right... But how do I handle the event if it gets fired twice
[07:45:07] <TheMoo> csnew: i'll have to check the event sender everytime then, which sounds like a hack
[07:45:45] <TheMoo> csnew: let's say I have 50 nested ULs (pretty extreme example) and I have to do an IF check 50 times. That's a waste of resources
[07:46:44] * TheMoo making breakfast real quick
[07:46:47] <S-Work> I'm retrieving JSON data using getJSON and this works fine 99,99% of the time but sometimes, which seems at random, there is nothing returned (entirely empty body) eventhough the request is ok and I can see in my developer console there's actually data being written to the page which returns the JSON objects, I know it returns something eventhough getJSON seems to think it doesn't.
[07:47:07] <S-Work> It looks like issues with crossdomain calls where I should be using JSONP instead but its local
[07:47:17] <S-Work> and it works nearly all the time
[07:47:35] <S-Work> what could cause this behaviour?
[07:47:54] <smplstk> S-Work: it's all local, like... everything?
[07:48:22] <v0lZy> hello
[07:48:22] <S-Work> well I'm using a development server which serves everything from the same domain
[07:48:51] <S-Work> the js itself is loaded from the same domain as the domain the json call goes to
[07:49:27] <v0lZy> I have a relaively simple problme.. I have an unordered list with <li><a class="ActiveMenuLink'></a></li> and I want to use fadeOut on the <a> element who's classs is ActiveMenuLink
[07:49:29] <v0lZy> i tried
[07:49:51] <v0lZy> $('ActiveMenuLink').fadeOut(1000, function() { }); but no luck
[07:50:06] <smplstk> S-Work: it sounds like perhaps you're now waiting for the jSON callback, but without seeing a code example, it's just speculation.
[07:50:14] <TheMoo> use $('.ActiveMenuLink')
[07:50:16] <TheMoo> notice the .
[07:50:17] <smplstk> *not*
[07:54:34] <csnew> TheMoo: interesting enough
[07:54:47] <csnew> TheMoo: when you drop the element within the list
[07:54:56] <csnew> TheMoo: after it has been attached to the new list
[07:55:01] <S-Work> smplstk, it's nothing special really, here's the code http://pastebin.com/neufEnsD
[07:55:02] <csnew> TheMoo: it only fires once
[07:55:53] <v0lZy> another question
[07:55:56] <smplstk> S-Work: it looks like you're doing everything correctly on this end.
[07:56:05] <v0lZy> how do i do animations in sequence and then in sequence, remove and add classes
[07:56:07] <v0lZy> it seems to remove it too fast
[07:56:11] <v0lZy> mid animation
[07:57:06] <S-Work> There's one thing I'm noticing in firebug though smplstk
[07:57:19] <S-Work> whenever it fails the json request takes long
[07:57:30] <S-Work> 1.2s vs ~100ms
[07:57:51] <S-Work> the getJSON call is within a timed function and runs every 2 seconds
[07:58:19] <S-Work> had the same issues with a delay of 5 seconds though
[07:58:34] <ryanneufeld> S-Work: http://pastebin.com/Sw1PCiQE
[07:58:41] <smplstk> S-Work: if the server is returning empty jSON, chances are it's something on the server side that's messing up
[07:58:52] <ryanneufeld> if it's failing randomly, use the fail handler to find out why
[07:59:21] <S-Work> O
[07:59:57] <ryanneufeld> v0lZy: there is animation queues, also all the animation methods take a callback parameter
[08:00:18] <S-Work> I'm not sure if it would ever reach the fail handler though, since every time I get an empty response (according to getJSON that is) it does continue into the $.each function
[08:00:53] <smplstk> S-Work: like I said, there's no real reason your API should be returning empty jSON
[08:00:54] <S-Work> which then fails in its subfunctionality because it is essentially working with no data at all
[08:01:08] <S-Work> I know smplstk, but it isnt
[08:01:15] <S-Work> it just does according to getJSON
[08:01:16] <ryanneufeld> S-Work: you should be validating your data any how
[08:01:39] <smplstk> yeah, you should write a check before your $.each
[08:01:46] <S-Work> true ryanneufeld, I'm going to add it, thanks
[08:02:08] <ryanneufeld> S-Work: I usually have my json contain at least a minimum value of result: true/false
[08:02:18] <ryanneufeld> then it's as easy as if(data.result)
[08:02:34] <smplstk> ryanneufeld, S-Work, and if that fails, request again!
[08:02:40] <ryanneufeld> smplstk: maybe
[08:02:42] <v0lZy> ryanneufeld: so i just thread them
[08:02:47] <v0lZy> like nest them one into the other?
[08:02:56] <ryanneufeld> v0lZy: that would be an ugly way of doing it
[08:03:12] <ryanneufeld> v0lZy: there is fx queue support in jquery, i'd check that out
[08:03:21] <ryanneufeld> smplstk: what you're saying is polling
[08:03:24] <ryanneufeld> smplstk: which is bad
[08:04:01] <ryanneufeld> smplstk: S-Work what you should do is if it fails, is notify the user. but just hitting the server again isn't a good idea
[08:04:06] <ryanneufeld> what happens if the second attempt fails?
[08:04:11] <ryanneufeld> What do you do then?
[08:04:16] <ryanneufeld> try a third?
[08:05:18] <S-Work> well ryanneufeld, I'll just need it for debugging right now, the user doesn't really need to be notified since the getJSON will get called again a few seconds later
[08:05:20] <S-Work> its timed..
[08:06:30] <ryanneufeld> S-Work: ah so you're polling any way
[08:07:02] * TheMoo Back from making breakfa
[08:07:06] <S-Work> yeah the page is constantly updating various numbers
[08:07:08] * TheMoo *st
[08:08:50] <ryanneufeld> S-Work: well, it does seem strange that your json is coming back empty. Could it be your server is preventing too many connections in a given time frame?
[08:09:12] <ryanneufeld> S-Work: that and are you setting expire headers so the browser will cache correctly?
[08:09:46] <S-Work> ryanneufeld, I'm using a django debug server and I added some debug information to the console of it
[08:09:51] <S-Work> I can see that when the request fails
[08:09:55] <S-Work> the server actually returns the page just fine
[08:10:01] <S-Work> with data
[08:10:48] <ryanneufeld> are you looking at the web server side or the browser side? the web server might be fine, but depending on headers your browser cold be misbehaving
[08:10:52] <robsonkarls> how can i stop an event  on click event,   like, $().click(function());
[08:10:54] <ryanneufeld> *coukd
[08:11:03] <ryanneufeld> *could
[08:11:06] <robsonkarls> how can i stop an event  on click event,   like, $().click(function(  return false; ));  ???
[08:11:07] <S-Work> yeah well firebug tells me it returns a 200 OK msg
[08:11:08] <ryanneufeld> fuck I need coffee
[08:11:13] <S-Work> so I figured it had to do with JSONP
[08:11:23] <ryanneufeld> S-Work: this is cross domain?
[08:11:28] <S-Work> but that made no sense since it worked fine
[08:11:35] <S-Work> with randomly not working moments
[08:11:38] <S-Work> no its not ryanneufeld
[08:11:41] <ryanneufeld> robsonkarls: what do you mean by stop it?
[08:11:46] <Ezek2k4> im trying to make an autocomplete but for some reason some values are missing... and i think its because of some characters... var users_list = [ "\"argane\'s\"","arganault.",
[08:11:47] <ryanneufeld> S-Work: then you don't need jsonp
[08:11:47] <S-Work> so I reverted back from the JSONP options
[08:11:52] <ryanneufeld> ah
[08:11:53] <ryanneufeld> k
[08:11:56] <Ezek2k4> is this the right way to scape those chars?
[08:12:08] <S-Work> maybe it is serverside though, I might have to inspect the actual data it returns again
[08:12:21] <S-Work> and see if it fails there somewhere because as it looks now the js = fine
[08:12:26] <robsonkarls> ryanneufeld:   when clicked a link , i dont want it to  redirect to link page, i just want to  check form, got that?
[08:12:44] <S-Work> I'll have a look into that, thanks for the help so far all
[08:12:49] <Ezek2k4> this is the original before spacing the values with php addslashes, var users_list = [ ""argane's"","arganault.",
[08:12:57] <Ezek2k4> scaping
[08:13:26] <Ezek2k4> but for some reason the ' is not being scapped correctly i think
[08:13:48] <ryanneufeld> robsonkarls: well, returning false in a click function should do it, but if you're binding to a submit button on a form, you want to use .submit() on the form not the button
[08:14:16] <robsonkarls> ryanneufeld: exactly :P
[08:14:18] <ryanneufeld> Ezek2k4: you don't need to escape the ' if i's in double quotes
[08:14:18] <robsonkarls> thx man
[08:14:20] <robsonkarls> u rock
[08:14:27] <ryanneufeld> robsonkarls: I do.
[08:14:39] <ryanneufeld> robsonkarls: I'm modest too, just ask me, I'll tell you :p
[08:15:21] <uchuff> hi all, apologies if i'm missing something obvious but is there a way to stop JQuery UI datepicker from highlighting the current date?
[08:15:42] <uchuff> wondering if i need to hook into beforeshow and return a different class or something
[08:15:44] <ryanneufeld> uchuff:
[08:15:52] <uchuff> already doing that to enable/disable individual dates
[08:16:10] <agentcobra> hi
[08:16:18] <ryanneufeld> uchuff: yes, check the docs ;)
[08:16:21] <uchuff> hah
[08:17:13] <ryanneufeld> uchuff: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-defaultDate
[08:18:01] <TheMoo> csnew: Do you need me here? I kinda need to go
[08:18:29] <uchuff> thanks ryanneufeld but i'm happy for today to be selected by default, but then say the user selects tomorrow, today is still highlighted a different colour to the other available days
[08:18:40] <uchuff> i'd want "today" to just look like any other day when not selected
[08:18:43] <uchuff> if that makes sense
[08:18:49] <ryanneufeld> uchuff: that's in the css
[08:19:11] <ryanneufeld> inspect the element, find the class it get's that's special and just delete it from the css file. Bob's your uncle
[08:19:27] <uchuff> ya it's given ui-state-highlight
[08:20:07] <uchuff> issue with that is, if someone else reuses what i'm building (that's the plan) they'd need to edit any theme they rollered
[08:23:18] <jbelcher> Hey allâ€”I'm inserting an iframe and a script element with one .append() call. The script performs actions on the iframe, but this seems to not be working. Could this be because of append()'s evalScript behavior when inserting script elements?
[08:23:49] <jbelcher> Things work if they're hard-coded into html instead of dynamically appended
[08:27:13] <xckpd7> how could I use jQuery to detect when Facebook comments are done loading?
[08:27:52] <rubial> if using mutiple selectors how can i detect  which selector is used??
[08:30:48] <guspe> My form has several labels. Each label contains an input of checkbox type. When the user clicks a label, a function is fired to count how many checkboxes are "checked". If 2 are checked, all the other checkboxes change color and are "disabled". The form only accepts submission if at least 2 checkboxes are checked. All is working fine. However, if I select a label using a selector and try to...
[08:30:50] <guspe> ...fire a click using .trigger('click'), the color of the other checkboxes doesn't change. The click is fired because, when I try to submit the form, it accepts the subimission; But why don't the colors change?
[08:35:41] <djQuery> is grid not included in jqueryui 1.8.16 stable?
[08:36:51] <rubial> in ('#nav li, #nav li ul li').hover(
[08:37:06] <rubial> how can i detect which selector is used
[08:37:08] <rubial> any idea?
[08:40:04] <djQuery> test to see if the li has a parent ul that has a parent li?
[08:40:44] <Barbaren> hey, quick question, I'm working with jquery UI and most of the time when using some functon you get events and those events can be handled with functions which take "event" and "ui" as parameters, where can I find a specification of what methods are available on the "event" and "ui" objects?
[08:40:49] <hooloovoo> i know this prolly isn't the right channel, but does anyone know how i can install IE6 and Firefox 2 for testing compatability?
[08:41:25] <Barbaren> hooloovoo: don't give ie 6 users the pleasure by building crap for them.
[08:41:55] <hooloovoo> Barbaren: well i'm a fan of ignoring people with old browsers, but in this case i don't have a choice
[08:42:16] <nights> hooloovoo: you can find all of them for emulation of M$ webpage
[08:42:26] <Barbaren> you know, they don't make games for atari and commodore 64 anymore for a reason
[08:42:40] <hooloovoo> Barbaren: also you could console log those args and see what's in them.
[08:42:46] <nights> but like Barbaren i dont think you should care about who would use IE6 unless you have a very specific reason
[08:42:54] <hooloovoo> nights: hmmm, i'll see if i can find it.
[08:43:06] <nights> they huge though
[08:43:14] <nights> like what was it.... x GB
[08:43:17] <nights> they are
[08:43:53] <Barbaren> anyone got anything on my question?:)
[08:43:57] <nights> recently i omit certain words
[08:44:20] <djQuery> Barbaren: I typicaly just do a console.log and look at them real quick
[08:44:27] <hooloovoo> Barbaren: i just answered it =P
[08:44:35] <Barbaren> oh
[08:44:36] <Barbaren> ok
[08:45:19] <djQuery> Barbaren: dont make me break out my Atari 600
[08:45:50] <Barbaren> djinni: ^^
[08:45:57] <Barbaren> djQuery: does it run bf3?
[08:46:05] <Barbaren> didn't know about console :p
[08:46:08] <Barbaren> still new to javascript
[08:47:04] <djQuery> sorry its an Atari 800 and it plays centipede all day
[08:47:16] <ryanneufeld> Barbaren: each widget has it's own event and ui definitions
[08:47:22] <djQuery> ?console
[08:47:22] <bot-t> Firebug and the Command Line - http://getfirebug.com/commandline
[08:47:26] <Barbaren> right

[08:47:31] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[08:47:32] <Barbaren> but how come they're not documented on the api page?
[08:47:37] <djQuery> ?botsnack
[08:47:38] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[08:47:50] <djQuery> damn bot is slow today
[08:48:16] <eddiemonge> Barbaren: how come what isnt documented?
[08:48:19] <ryanneufeld> Barbaren: if you look on the overview page for the widgets it's there. Otherwise you can console.log(event, ui) in the handler you're using.
[08:48:29] <ryanneufeld> Barbaren: how are they not?
[08:48:33] <xckpd7> rubial: $this?
[08:48:43] <djQuery> Barbaren: take a look at this page for a quick tut on debuging http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[08:48:52] <Barbaren> right, they are :D
[08:49:08] <Barbaren> i was looking everywhere, except where it was
[08:49:46] <djQuery> anyone have a link for jqueryui grid?
[08:50:06] <nitrospectide> I have run into too many jquery slideshows that seem to suck up RAM if you let them run too long. Anyone have recommendations on clean, efficient and flexible options?

[08:50:58] <uchuff> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/34246941/Grid#Roadmap
[08:51:06] <djQuery> eddiemonge: doesnt seem to be a link to the actualy src there
[08:51:11] <eddiemonge> nitrospectide: if they are using a lot of ram it means they are adding elements and not removing them
[08:51:19] <eddiemonge> djQuery: its still a wip
[08:51:21] <xckpd7> that debuggin jQuery stuff is pretty sweet, thanks for the link

[08:55:39] <opie_> because of the way delegate binds behind the scenes?

[08:57:45] <vbajpai> I am using the google-charts API to generate a chart dynamically on the client side from the JSON I receive from my server. Now I want to share that chart on Facebook. So I have a share button; but I see that the Facebook feed API accepts a URL to an image I want to share. The chart is wrapped in a <svg></svg>. How do I get this done?
[08:57:45] <eddiemonge> nitrospectide: yeah, read its code
[08:58:10] <nitrospectide> eddiemonge: that would require me to understand it :( lol
[08:58:12] <opie_> eddiemonge: i did
[08:58:29] <eddiemonge> vbajpai: you do know this is a jquery channel and not a javascript channel right?
[08:58:29] <rubial> djQuery, why isn't the element and this matching
[08:58:59] <vbajpai> eddiemonge: yes, okay
[08:59:17] <eddiemonge> nitrospectide: exactly. you should know what you are putting on your page instead of just finding a script and copying it
[08:59:25] <ryanneufeld> opie_: if you read the docs, what's your question. What don't you understand?
[08:59:34] <rubial> djQuery, i need to check which one of the selector was used
[08:59:59] <djQuery> rubial: are you trying to create a cascading menu type of thing?
[09:00:16] <nitrospectide> eddiemonge: i agree - in an ideal situation... but there are only os many technologies and workflows one can jam into their head before it explodes. And I don;t have a staff of devs.
[09:00:43] <rubial> i am trying to create a submenu from a menu on hover and sub sub meny from submenu on hover
[09:00:50] <eddiemonge> nitrospectide: hire contractors then
[09:01:11] <opie_> ryanneufeld: i guess i was hoping jquery would do magic, but i guess i have to provide a string selector to get delegate performance since the framework would never know how to bind the delegate without the actual string .  i.e. i can't do element.on("click", ".selector") .. i have to do $(".container").on("click", ".selector")
[09:01:21] <eddiemonge> rubial: you might want to be careful of that from a UI standpoint
[09:01:59] <ryanneufeld> opie_: you can do $('body').on('click', 'selector', function(){}) but that's probably frowned uppon
[09:02:01] <basilbear> hi : I dont seem to be able to apply some additional styling to some ajax response html - I have a jsfiddle link here : http://jsfiddle.net/pborreli/pJgyu/

[09:02:38] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[09:02:41] <rubial> eddiemonge, what do u mean?
[09:02:46] <ryanneufeld> opie_: I was just gonna say what eddiemonge said
[09:03:03] <opie_> eddiemonge: right but $element = #('.element').on('click', '.select', func) doesn't
[09:03:11] <opie_> err, whoops whatever i got it
[09:03:22] <eddiemonge> rubial: having lots of slide/fading elements that are only shown on something else hover isnt great ui
[09:03:45] <ryanneufeld> opie_: well, if  you have var $element = $('selector'); then yes, that will work
[09:03:55] <eddiemonge> opie_: that works too

[09:06:00] <opie_> hmm, it does seem to work
[09:06:16] <eddiemonge> basilbear: the response seems styled to me
[09:06:41] <ryanneufeld> opie_: yeah that works exactly as you would expect :p
[09:06:57] <basilbear> eddiemonge: sorry, what do you mean?
[09:07:08] <basilbear> by styled
[09:07:10] <opie_> you know in the old delegate syntax you couldn't do live upon an element you had to use the selector string
[09:07:16] <eddiemonge> opie_: yeah it works. you should use this in the console http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/nDcv2/1/
[09:07:26] <eddiemonge> basilbear: i mean it has css applied to it
[09:07:54] <opie_> eddiemonge: yeah good call, ok something is screwed up in my widget code then
[09:07:55] <opie_> thanks
[09:08:07] <eddiemonge> opie_: im confused by your statement
[09:08:49] <Eviltwin> Wow, someone actually donated to this: http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255
[09:08:56] <rubial> how can $(this) and $('nav li') be equal
[09:09:04] <basilbear> eddiemonge: the reponse is an HTML snippet , a UL with nested LIs and DIVs ,  including some styling indeed
[09:09:28] <rubial> eddiemonge, http://pastebin.com/MjszS36S
[09:09:30] <eddiemonge> rubial: when you are in a callback that targets $('nav li')

[09:11:44] <eddiemonge> basilbear: this isnt your link: http://jsfiddle.net/pborreli/pJgyu/ ?
[09:11:58] <Eviltwin> rubial: Try $(this).is("#nav li") instead of this stuff with element
[09:11:59] <basilbear> eddiemonge: nope, sorry, http://jsfiddle.net/BasilBear/puPhE/
[09:12:21] <basilbear> eddiemonge: first time on jsfiddle and I blew it
[09:12:41] <PhonicUK> if I use background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.5); on an element - can i still change its opacity with .animate() on the opacity property?
[09:13:06] <eddiemonge> basilbear: that .each() is completely unnecessary if you are only adding a class
[09:13:28] <basilbear> eddiemonge: oh!
[09:13:37] <Eviltwin> basilbear: Also, you are working with DOM elements
[09:13:41] <eddiemonge> basilbear: and are you adding the markup to the DOM?
[09:13:46] <Eviltwin> Not HTML
[09:14:08] <basilbear> eddiemonge: yes, markup being output to a google maps infowindow
[09:14:15] <eddiemonge> PhonicUK: yeah. that background color isnt changing its opacity
[09:14:28] <Eviltwin> basilbear: Then you need infoWindowContent.html()
[09:14:31] <basilbear> Eviltwin: pls elaborate - is there an error in that
[09:14:35] <eddiemonge> Eviltwin: no, its wrapped in $()
[09:14:40] <PhonicUK> bum, I actually want to animate the alpha component of the background color
[09:14:57] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: So a glorified array of DOM elements...
[09:15:42] <PhonicUK> is there a good way of doing that?
[09:15:51] <eddiemonge> Eviltwin: its a jquery object. $.post(url, function(data) { // if data is html then $(data) lets you use jquery on that html string
[09:16:10] <eddiemonge> PhonicUK: animate(background-color)
[09:16:23] <eddiemonge> although im not sure if that would work without the color plugin
[09:16:24] <Eviltwin> Yes but you can't do "<p>"+$("<a href='#'>Foo</a>")+"</p>"
[09:16:32] <eddiemonge> basilbear: can you paste more of an example
[09:16:35] <PhonicUK> eddiemonge, the reference for animate says that background-color cannot be animated
[09:16:53] <eddiemonge> Eviltwin: no but you can do "<p>"+$("<a href='#'>Foo</a>")[0]+"</p>"
[09:17:19] <eddiemonge> well you can do that too but the results are going to be odd
[09:17:28] <Eviltwin> "<p>[object HTMLElement]</p>"
[09:17:35] <basilbear> eddiemonge: maybe, not sure what else to provide as there's not a lot to what I want to do - let me see
[09:17:44] <Eviltwin> Just like "<p>"+$("<b>")+"</p>" is "<p>[object Object]</p>"
[09:17:48] <eddiemonge> PhonicUK: because core cant animate colors on its own
[09:18:08] <eddiemonge> Eviltwin: yeah, lke i said, you can do it but it may not be whats expected
[09:18:27] <Eviltwin> So I should have been clearer
[09:18:28] <eddiemonge> basilbear: your actual code, mostly the full ajax code
[09:18:39] <Eviltwin> You can't do that to accomplish what you want to accomplish
[09:19:42] <basilbear> eddiemonge: ok two ticks pls
[09:20:34] <eddiemonge> i dont have any ticks. i shower everyday and care about cleanliness\

[09:21:22] <nnull> is it possible to execute 2 handlers at once without using a cpu crunching while loop?

[09:21:50] <Eviltwin> nnull: JavaScript is single-threaded
[09:21:56] <nnull> Eviltwin, eg, id like to resize a box model while changing its opacity at the same time
[09:22:08] <Eviltwin> Look at setTimeout
[09:22:08] <ryanneufeld> nnull: you can do that with animate
[09:22:11] <eddiemonge> nnull: you mean run two animates at once
[09:22:13] <MACscr> eddiemonge: I basically want to post to one page, but redirect to another. My code looks like so: http://jsfiddle.net/3Zy7u/9/

[09:48:10] <MTPrower> Good morning awesome fun peeps. I know little to nothing about jQuery, but I know my site is having a jQuery contradiction, most likely originating from the mp3 player below the slideshow. I know it's basic jQuery, but I don't know jQuery. Can someone take a look at my site, please? http://www.vgreboot.com/
[09:49:26] * Chani wonders how someone makes a public website in jquery without knowing any jquery :)
[09:50:02] <MTPrower> Chani: I didn't. I followed instructions to add a jquery mp3 player to my site. And failed, apparently
[09:50:15] <Chani> MTPrower: ah. sucky.
[09:50:29] <MTPrower> Chani: I have the instructions if you want them
[09:51:52] <Eviltwin> arvind_khadri: It's because you're trying to look inside an iframe
[09:52:19] <rubial> Eviltwin, thanks man with your help and lil debugging i have done what i was trying to do
[09:52:39] <Eviltwin> rubial: Congrats!
[09:52:40] <arvind_khadri> Eviltwin, thanks :) So how do I avoid the iframe, when I hit one?
[09:52:48] <rubial> Eviltwin, i owe you a beer
[09:52:56] <Chani> MTPrower: sory, I don' know much more than you yet.
[09:53:10] <Chani> and I think I was supposed to be doing homework... not wandering the internet...
[09:53:12] * Eviltwin is accepting tips at http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255
[09:53:47] <MTPrower> Chani: I know that all the jQuery ABOVE the new mp3 player works, in general, and all the jQuery BELOW it fails. The slideshow widget shows up at the bottom, and the green text below the MP3 player WAS a scrolling marquee. Not anymore...
[09:53:59] <jedimind> doesnt that go against freenode code of ethics of some sorts Eviltwin ?
[09:54:04] <jedimind> i mean it is FREE node

[09:55:10] <Eviltwin> From people across oceans from me
[09:55:23] <eddiemonge> MTPrower: what specifically is breaking?
[09:56:19] <MTPrower> eddiemonge: that green text below the MP3 player was a marquee. If you scroll to the bottom of the site, there's a chat. That used to be in a slidebar on the site. So basically, jQuery below my new jQuery MP3 player breaks, I think. http://www.vgreboot.com/
[09:56:34] <MTPrower> eddiemonge: I have the exact instructions I used to add the MP3 player, if you want them

[10:00:15] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: you're doing it wrong ;p
[10:00:21] <Eviltwin> GarethTheGreat: Start by looking at those 3 things
[10:00:26] <eddiemonge> i wonder if it has anything to do with that cloudflare script loader
[10:00:27] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: of course. I just followed instructions
[10:00:30] <GarethTheGreat> i think that'll be enough, thanks
[10:00:54] <m___> Hi. Need some help here. What this code does? ->>>  var i = /^bob$/i;
[10:01:00] <MTPrower> eddiemonge: that's my CDN. I just turned it off. Refresh the page and see what you get
[10:01:04] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: http://pastebin.com/wu4XhcBt eddiemonge
[10:01:07] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: bot-t should accept comma-separated values
[10:01:28] <Eviltwin> m___: It creates a regular expression that matches the case insensitive string "bob"
[10:01:37] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: bot-t doesn't really get a lot of code changes, none of us can touch him except temp01 and he's not around so much these days
[10:01:39] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: that could be broken. What's wrong with it?
[10:01:45] <Eviltwin> m___: YOu can so i.match("bob") and i.match("BoB") etc.
[10:02:03] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: look at what I wrote, and what you wrote
[10:02:13] <eddiemonge> marquee. classic
[10:02:16] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: you don't need to pass in the $ to it that way
[10:02:22] <arvind_khadri> Eviltwin, I tried to log this.nodeName.  So even nodeName will fail at iframe?
[10:02:36] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: is that pastebin yours, and mine is different?
[10:02:39] <Eviltwin> arvind_khadri: Yup, I suggest a try-catch
[10:03:23] <arvind_khadri> Eviltwin, ohh, but it is an error not an exception..  Am sorry if that sounds foolish.
[10:03:42] <MTPrower> eddiemonge: that marquee is actually pretty neat. It's not like traditional marquees
[10:03:57] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: I'm confused
[10:03:59] <Eviltwin> arvind_khadri: Pretty sure you can still try-catch it
[10:04:04] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: yes, it is, and it is
[10:04:13] <ryanneufeld> it doesn't work either though
[10:04:20] <arvind_khadri> Eviltwin, ok :) will do it right away.
[10:04:31] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: if I disable the mp3 player, it will work
[10:04:47] <Eviltwin> arvind_khadri: It's possible the issue is with the .contents() itself though
[10:04:49] <m___> Eviltwin understood. But how should I do to get a regex for a string for any number of zeros? Im trying to prevent a text input to get "0" or "00" or "000" and so on
[10:04:58] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: well, sometimes it has problems, but... it ends up working
[10:05:07] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: thematic-dropdowns.js:3
[10:05:11] <ryanneufeld> that script is breaking shit
[10:05:12] <Eviltwin> m___: /^0+$/ matches one or more 0's
[10:05:26] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: you don't need noConflict() there
[10:05:32] <ryanneufeld> you can just use $
[10:05:43] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: I can edit that, I think. What should I replace it with?
[10:05:43] <arvind_khadri> Eviltwin, ohh I see.  Can you suggest any other way of going about adding spans to all textnodes, then?
[10:05:46] <m___> Eviltwin: nice! Tyvm! :)
[10:06:11] <vdt> can I ask a question here about html5 and js?
[10:06:19] <Eviltwin> arvind_khadri: I suggest you define a named function that looks at all the children of the specified element
[10:06:27] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: http://pastebin.com/9pVmHs9t
[10:06:35] <ryanneufeld> ?ask @ vdt
[10:06:36] <bot-t> vdt, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:06:36] <Eviltwin> arvind_khadri: Spanifies all of them
[10:06:49] <Eviltwin> arvind_khadri: And then calls itself on each of the children
[10:07:07] <tharkun> Gentlemen are there known isues with jQuery and Internet Explorer 7 ?
[10:07:30] <vdt> Is it possible to make an animation like this one http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0bsvJQRag#at=96 that will display dynamic numbers and waveforms just using html5 canvas api for the animation and js to retrieve the data that will be displayed from a server? I have made it in flash/actionscript but idk nothing about html5/js :/
[10:07:36] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: you're using hoverintent and superfish?
[10:07:48] <arvind_khadri> Eviltwin, hmmm, thanks :) Doing the try catch now.
[10:07:56] <ryanneufeld> vdt: yes it is, but no one here is gonna tell you how
[10:08:01] <Eviltwin> arvind_khadri: function x(elem) { try {$(elem).contents().each(<spanification>); $(elem).contents().each(x); } catch(e) {} }
[10:08:21] <ryanneufeld> vdt: we'll help you solve smaller problems as you're working on it though
[10:08:29] <Eviltwin> arvind_khadri: Then call x($("body"))
[10:08:47] <Eviltwin> arvind_khadri: This will recursively spanify everything
[10:09:43] <arvind_khadri> Eviltwin, thanks a lot, will try that right away.
[10:09:55] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: you with me?
[10:09:57] <tharkun> Is there some obscure documentation i've yet to read that explains dark corners of ie7 and how to avoid them?
[10:10:13] <Eviltwin> tharkun: No, everyone needs to go out on their own and learn
[10:10:17] <Ezek2k4> im trying to make dynamic fields and add datepicker to it but im having trouble because the date picker always change the first generated field
[10:10:23] <Ezek2k4>  $("body").delegate("input.dp", "focus", function(){ $(this).removeClass('dp').datepicker(); }); this is the code
[10:11:04] <Ezek2k4> and this is the field im appending <input name="doempty[]" type="date" id="doempty[]" class="dp"/>
[10:11:17] <Eviltwin> ?jsfiddle @ Ezek2k4
[10:11:18] <bot-t> Ezek2k4, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests. These tools allow you to replicate your issue and pres
[10:11:24] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: back. Sorry
[10:11:32] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: http://pastebin.com/9pVmHs9t
[10:11:32] <tharkun> Eviltwin: Thanks for saying the truth, now i know where i am standing
[10:11:34] <vdt> ryanneufeld: yes I know for sure, just wanted a starter hint like whats a good way to do the comunication with the server by using ajax/jquery, like "read about ..."  instead of "read the jquery entire documentation"
[10:11:50] <Eviltwin> tharkun: I'd Google around for the problems people have run into
[10:12:01] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: I changed the code, but it didn't fix the marquee or slidebar
[10:12:05] <Eviltwin> tharkun: But there's no central repository of IE fuckups that I know of
[10:12:06] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[10:12:14] <tharkun> Eviltwin: lol
[10:12:28] <Eviltwin> tharkun: Using jQuery simplifies a lot of the JavaScript standardness issues
[10:12:35] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: the error says that supersubs doesn't exist
[10:12:40] <andrew9183> hey guys, i can do $("body").find("[foo\\:bar]"), but this breaks in ie7, can i use filter instead, ie $("body").filter("[foo:bar]") ?
[10:12:41] <eddiemonge> vdt:  if you dont know anything about html5/js you are going to have an extremely tough time doing something excessively complicated like that
[10:13:13] <eddiemonge> andrew9183: its the same selector syntax
[10:13:19] <vdt> eddiemonge: challenge accepted lol :D
[10:13:21] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: so there is a problem with whatever JS file is loading that in, but you're using superfish and hoverintent, how come?
[10:13:29] <andrew9183> eddiemonge: would i require the two backslashes to escape the : ?
[10:13:31] <andrew9183> in filter that is
[10:13:31] <eddiemonge> andrew9183: why do you have an attribute like that anyway?
[10:13:55] <ryanneufeld> andrew9183: colons aren't valid html for attribute names
[10:13:58] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: dunno. That's what the thematic developer did. I don't think that's the problem. The problem is that big white mp3 player. It breaks other stuff
[10:13:59] <eddiemonge> andrew9183: yes
[10:14:17] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: k
[10:14:20] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: before that was put in, things worked. Want a copy of my header.php? Everything's in there
[10:14:24] <andrew9183> ryanneufeld: is there any way to use them?
[10:14:27] <eddiemonge> MTPrower: can you take it out so we can see what it looks like?
[10:14:35] <eddiemonge> andrew9183: why would you?
[10:14:35] <andrew9183> eddiemonge: it's just a nice way to have pseudo namespaces
[10:14:37] <MTPrower> eddiemonge: take what out?
[10:14:45] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @ andrew9183
[10:14:46] <bot-t> andrew9183, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[10:14:47] <eddiemonge> andrew9183: data-namespace works just fine
[10:14:55] <eddiemonge> MTPrower: the mp3 player. undo the work you did
[10:16:36] <MTPrower> eddiemonge: all the work is in here: http://pastebin.com/NYmJJCtE
[10:16:40] <robsonkarls> does any know  where can i find amazing gifs for loading state?
[10:16:46] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: http://pastebin.com/NYmJJCtE
[10:17:01] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ MTPrower
[10:17:01] <bot-t> MTPrower, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[10:17:16] <eddiemonge> robsonkarls: i hear google has some
[10:17:27] <robsonkarls> ahaha
[10:17:40] <robsonkarls> yah, already tried, but they dont have  criativity
[10:17:43] <robsonkarls> Â¬Â¬
[10:17:50] <MTPrower> eddiemonge: what?
[10:18:09] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: I found your problem
[10:18:17] <ryanneufeld> you're loading multiple versions of jquery
[10:18:33] <ryanneufeld> you have some script code in your header calling jQuery.noConflict()
[10:18:35] <ryanneufeld> delete it
[10:18:44] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: I thought so. We could have figured that out a long time ago...
[10:18:58] <ryanneufeld> and get rid of the jquery 1.4 cdn you're including after as well
[10:19:01] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: urm... you sure about that?
[10:19:07] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: yes
[10:19:11] <eddiemonge> wordpress is including its own version
[10:19:16] <ryanneufeld> delete that line <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4/jquery.min.js"></script>
[10:19:17] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: alright, what should my code look like?
[10:19:23] <ryanneufeld> delete that line <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4/jquery.min.js"></script>
[10:19:33] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: I thought I deleted that already
[10:19:36] <MTPrower> weird
[10:19:37] <ryanneufeld> and delete the entire script tag that has the jquery.noconflict already
[10:19:44] <ryanneufeld> clearly you did not :P
[10:20:06] <ohsnap> i'm trying to animate the transition between opsition absolute and relative with a bunch of links, is this possible? http://jsfiddle.net/9Ext3/
[10:20:10] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: where's the noconflict?
[10:20:18] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: view source dude
[10:20:22] <ryanneufeld> I'm not gonna do it for you
[10:20:29] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: it's not on the header.php
[10:20:41] <ryanneufeld> orly?
[10:20:43] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: but I think I can find it. If you can narrow stuff down, I'd appreciate it
[10:20:56] <ryanneufeld> I don't have your php in front of me dude
[10:21:03] <ryanneufeld> you're gonna have to search the files for it
[10:21:04] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: kay
[10:21:08] <ryanneufeld> view the page source
[10:21:18] <ryanneufeld> and you'll see what I'm talking about
[10:21:28] <ryanneufeld> then start digging in, see what you can find
[10:22:11] <tharkun> Eviltwin: Actually the only javascript in use is the cascade plugin since I personally hate the usual "It does not work call"
[10:22:53] <eddiemonge> MTPrower: that'll be $50 payable to ryanneufeld please
[10:22:56] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: FACK. Removing that line breaks my mp3 player. For some reason, the mp3 player isn't using WordPress's jquery
[10:23:25] <ryanneufeld> does it?
[10:23:44] <tman> is .html() supported in ie?
[10:23:51] <ravenzz> sure
[10:23:54] <tman> hmm
[10:23:55] <tman> crap.
[10:24:24] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: actually is that you haven't removed the noConflict() part
[10:24:33] <ravenzz> tman I am happy of this :p you should be happy as well
[10:24:35] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: Do all the things, not just the pretty ones
[10:24:47] <ryanneufeld> that sounded wrong...
[10:24:57] <nights> hi
[10:25:08] <khmer> guys? under what circumstances will an ajax request responseText not be available?
[10:25:10] <tman> ravenzz: yea ;)
[10:25:11] <khmer> when the status code is an error, right?
[10:25:22] <ryanneufeld> ?.fail @ khmer
[10:25:22] <bot-t> khmer, deferred.fail(failCallbacks, [failCallbacks]): Add handlers to be called when the Deferred object is rejected. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.fail/
[10:25:36] <ryanneufeld> ?ajax @khmer
[10:25:37] <bot-t> khmer, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:25:38] <eddiemonge> bot-t: tell coldhead ryanneufeld:  Do all the things, not just the pretty ones
[10:25:38] <bot-t> eddiemonge, Okay.
[10:25:48] <ryanneufeld> LOL
[10:25:51] <nights> in this statement, function(){jQuery.ajax({'type':'POST','data':{'testvariable':'TESTVAR'},'    how do i insert $('#category1_form').serialize() in 'data' (replacing the testvariable)  ?
[10:25:57] <khmer> ryanneufeld: what i'm asking his how to reproduce that behavior
[10:26:03] <nights> probably super simple, but i dont know :(
[10:26:11] <khmer> ryanneufeld: i'm trying to make a raw ajax request to a service i built to always return error codes.
[10:26:13] <eddiemonge> khmer: you want it to fail?
[10:26:17] <khmer> i sure do!
[10:26:21] <eddiemonge> thats odd
[10:26:32] <khmer> we're building a REST API
[10:26:39] <khmer> trying to decide how to suppress response codes
[10:26:42] <eddiemonge> khmer: did you read the ajax documentation?
[10:26:45] <khmer> twitter does it with a parameter switch
[10:26:57] <khmer> eddiemonge: rest assured i have. ;)
[10:27:30] <sk8ball> hey guys im looking for a good plugin like an up-to-date sticky scroll, that allows a floating div to stay fixed at the top of the screen when you scroll down, and then when scrolling back up stops back at its orignal position
[10:27:31] <khmer> right now i'm just creating a raw XHR in my browser console, running an ajax request that returns 401, and then testing if responseText is available
[10:27:34] <khmer> ....and it is!
[10:27:34] <sk8ball> reccomendations?
[10:27:46] <khmer> this makes it hard to build my test suite. i thought it wasn't supposed to be available. what am i missing?
[10:28:23] <eddiemonge> khmer: got example code?
[10:28:33] <khmer> hmm, i do. one minute
[10:28:39] <ravenzz> sk8ball you code that in 10minutes
[10:28:54] <ravenzz> can*
[10:29:05] <ryanneufeld> sk8ball: ravenzz is right
[10:29:15] <sk8ball> im ure it is pretty simple
[10:29:25] <sk8ball> javascript isnt my primary language
[10:29:34] <sk8ball> i do server side code primarily
[10:29:44] <khmer> eddiemonge: http://pastebin.com/SUR0ui78
[10:29:52] <sk8ball> and i dont want to reinvent he wheel
[10:29:58] <sk8ball> surely there is a plugin
[10:30:06] <sk8ball> thats the idea behind jquery
[10:30:59] <sk8ball> ravenzz, care to bust out a little exmple on your favorite pastebin?
[10:31:09] <ravenzz> you can ask on #wordpress
[10:31:09] <sk8ball> teach me
[10:31:22] <ravenzz> if are you looking for a prebuilt one
[10:31:26] <sk8ball> i know you'd have to look for the div to reach top
[10:31:30] <nights> in this statement, function(){jQuery.ajax({'type':'POST','data':{'testvariable':'TESTVAR'},'    how do i insert $('#category1_form').serialize() in 'data' (replacing the testvariable)  ?
[10:31:38] <eddiemonge> sk8ball: its not that simple
[10:31:39] <sk8ball> and then change its css
[10:31:40] <nights> something like js:'testvariable='+$(\"#category1_form\").serialize();' ?
[10:31:49] <qwerty57> what's the name of a broad IT position at the office? i'm doing web admin/developing/design/sys admin/office support/etc
[10:31:55] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: alright, everything's working again, except the mp3 player. This is how everything's supposed to be, except the mp3 player. The REAL problem with the mp3 player is that it is not loading jQuery from Google because that line is removed. If I add that line, everything else breaks again. So what I think we need to do is get the mp3 player to load WordPress's copy of jQuery. I believe that is our goal... That line with Google's 
[10:32:08] <sk8ball> eddie, help a brother out

[10:32:52] <qwerty57> it manager?
[10:33:17] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: I'm telling you that's your problem, I have repeated it 5x now. That's why it's breaking

[10:33:25] <bot-t> MTPrower, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[10:33:28] <eddiemonge> khmer: so whats the issue?
[10:33:29] <ravenzz> what is written in your contract? :d
[10:33:31] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: kay
[10:33:45] <ravenzz> qwerty57 try on #web
[10:33:54] <qwerty57> kk
[10:33:57] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: so it unsets $, which, means that your mp3 player isn't able to find jquery
[10:33:57] <sk8ball> eddie, please? kinda walk me through the steps i need to perform
[10:34:00] <khmer> eddiemonge: i thought that browsers wouldn't let you see the responseText if the status code was in the 400 or 500 series
[10:34:10] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: also, those script types are all wrong, just take them out
[10:34:17] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: you don't need them at all
[10:34:19] <khmer> eddiemonge: i know there's some kind of issue there, that's why twitter for instance has a suppress_response_codes parameter on their api
[10:34:21] <eddiemonge> sk8ball: theres a lot. like i said, its not simple. google sticky sidebar
[10:34:35] <khmer> eddiemonge: i thought it was simple as the responseText property being inaccessible!
[10:34:42] <sk8ball> its not a side bar tho
[10:34:43] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: wait, I'm wrong django is doing something with that
[10:34:46] <khmer> eddiemonge: but apparently there's something else i need to do to reproduce this issue.
[10:34:50] <sk8ball> its a div in the middle of the page
[10:34:51] <eddiemonge> khmer: theres still a response but you need to look at the status
[10:35:02] <eddiemonge> khmer: and thats not jquery
[10:35:13] <eddiemonge> sk8ball: same idea
[10:35:15] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: what's django?
[10:35:21] <ryanneufeld> I dunno
[10:35:38] <ryanneufeld> but this is wrong type='text/djs' data-djssrc
[10:35:45] <ryanneufeld> on all your script tags
[10:35:57] <khmer> eddiemonge: right but how do i reproduce the case where the responseText is unavailable?
[10:36:00] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: where did you get this theme>
[10:36:00] <ryanneufeld> ?
[10:36:18] <Meidor> okay i've jsfidled my code, in this demo i first fade in and fade out the activitydiv manualy and than i call longWait() which essentialy does the same as i did before but this time nothing happens what is wrong? (for some reason the spinner itself doesnt work but i think that isn't the bug here) here is the js fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/XFYKv/40/
[10:36:47] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: This started as Thematic from ThemeShaper. I just edited it. A lot.
[10:37:14] <eddiemonge> ryanneufeld: those are the script loaders but for what i dont know
[10:37:15] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: Thematic is a wireframe theme, made for individual them development. It kicks ass.
[10:37:26] <eddiemonge> khmer: dont send a response and only send the header code
[10:37:39] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wordpress-has-changed-my-javascript-code
[10:37:51] <ryanneufeld> cloudflare is fucking with your code
[10:37:52] <khmer> eddiemonge: i am writing unit tests. i need to reproduce this issue, period.
[10:37:54] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: thanks. Will read
[10:38:12] <nights> how do i insert $('#category1_form').serialize() in 'data':{} of an ajax call?
[10:38:46] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: fix that , and the jQuery.noConflict, and you should be in decent shape
[10:38:47] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: I disabled minify some time ago. I'll just wait for everything to work out. Still, that mp3 player is weird...
[10:39:04] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: I'm pretty sure that's supposed to be there...
[10:39:05] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: did you kill the jQuery.noConflict() ?
[10:39:10] <eddiemonge> nights: i ladread told you
[10:39:15] <nights> oh sorry
[10:39:17] <nights> let me check
[10:39:19] <eddiemonge> wow that should have been already
[10:39:25] <eddiemonge> nights: 'testvariable='+$("#category1_form").val()
[10:39:52] <eddiemonge> nights: or do $.post(url, $('yourform').serialize(), yourcallback)
[10:39:55] <nights> eddiemonge: oh, thanks. how about the serialization?
[10:39:55] <nights> ah
[10:40:00] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: I did at one point, and it changed nothing at the time. I'll wait for Cloudflare to stop derping things and then I'll try again. This is the dropdown, right? I think that code should be there...
[10:40:15] <nights> eddiemonge: thank you very much. let me check if i can get this working now.
[10:40:30] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: FFS
[10:40:47] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: what's FFS?
[10:40:54] <ryanneufeld> For Fuck Sakes
[10:41:26] <sk8ball> ok eddie, can you reccommend a specific plugin that isnt 3 years old?
[10:41:31] <ryanneufeld> look, I'm telling you, it's not needed, get rid of it, and you should be in good shape, it's actually causing you problems man
[10:41:35] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: sorry. You know what you know, but themeshaper knows what they know, and they've done pretty well until now...
[10:41:55] <sk8ball> anybody, a nice up to date sticky div plugin?
[10:42:05] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: is it in the dropdown menu? is that the one?
[10:42:20] <khmer> ryanneufeld: if you're more interested in my question...how the hell do i reproduce the problem where browsers intercept the body of http responses with error-series status codes?
[10:42:23] <ryanneufeld> OMFG, view the source code generated man
[10:42:53] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: I'm about ready to give up on your ass. I'm telling you exactly what to do to fix your problem
[10:43:11] <eddiemonge> khmer: they dont. they pass them through. thats why when you visit a 404 page you can have html in it
[10:43:15] <Eviltwin> ryanneufeld: I suggest you give up on his ass
[10:43:24] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: I work on a site that get's 45million unique visitors a month, I think I know what I'm talking about.
[10:43:52] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: yeah, i'm about done
[10:44:32] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: I've never been good at following instructions without reasons. Don't take it personally. Now, is it the dropdown.js you're talking about? If it is, then I know how to follow your instructions. If not, then I have to research for the code. I'm trying to figure out how to do what you asked. I apologize.
[10:44:32] <ryanneufeld> khmer: are you talking about the headers, like 400, 404, etc?
[10:44:44] <nights> eddiemonge: would this work too? 'testvariable='+$('#category1_form').val()
[10:44:46] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: open your site
[10:44:49] <nights> as in single quotes
[10:44:50] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: View the source
[10:44:54] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: kay
[10:44:57] <khmer> ryanneufeld: what is twitter talking about here: https://dev.twitter.com/docs/things-every-developer-should-know
[10:45:06] <khmer> ryanneufeld: the "suppress_response_codes" paraameter
[10:45:12] <ryanneufeld> find the the jquery.noConflict I was pointing out,
[10:45:13] <khmer> ryanneufeld: what is that meant to work around?
[10:45:17] <khmer> ryanneufeld: an error that i can't reproduce!!!
[10:45:18] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: then MAKE IT DIE
[10:45:46] <eddiemonge> nights: yes.
[10:45:54] <nights> ok, thanks. need to insert this into Yii
[10:46:06] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: alright, I'm still looking for it. Sorry for making you mad
[10:46:30] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: you're just not listening man, I've said the same thing 10 times now.
[10:46:51] <ryanneufeld> khmer: well, I'm not sure what twitter is doing, but are you setting response headers?
[10:46:54] <eddiemonge> khmer: its talking about things like jquery that act as an intermediary
[10:47:24] <khmer> eddiemonge: i've combed the 1.7 source and jquery doesn't block access to responseText in jqxhr. why even would it?
[10:47:24] <eddiemonge> khmer: in which case twitter will send a 200 and then send something like {status:fail, msg:somemessge}
[10:47:37] <khmer> ryanneufeld: why does twitter need to do that?
[10:47:38] <ryanneufeld> khmer: cause if it's not a 20x/30x I'm pretty sure that the fail handler on the jqXHR would deal with that
[10:47:41] <eddiemonge> it handles the error checking for you
[10:47:50] <khmer> i don't think i'm explaining myself clearly
[10:48:01] <khmer> we are writing a rest api.
[10:48:02] <ryanneufeld> khmer: we always return 200 for our ajax endpoints, and put the error in the payload
[10:48:02] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: I'm slow about things when I don't understand how they function. Just gimme a little time...
[10:48:05] <chee> kettle of fish
[10:48:10] <khmer> ryanneufeld: see, there! there! why do you do that?
[10:48:18] <khmer> ryanneufeld: what happens when you return a different response code?
[10:48:31] <khmer> ryanneufeld: the response body is somehow unavailable to the xhr object, right?
[10:48:40] <ryanneufeld> khmer: because we always have a response
[10:48:56] <ryanneufeld> khmer: if you hit a 404 on our page, the ajax fail handler is called
[10:49:00] <ryanneufeld> so we deal with it that way
[10:49:27] <khmer> what about other http response codes, like 403 and 401?
[10:49:41] <eddiemonge> khmer: so anything other than 2xx or 3xx is an error in getting the data there and back. in those situations the response *can* contain data but really shouldnt. those are network/server errors.
[10:50:04] <khmer> i know, we're trying to implement response codes meaningfully
[10:50:17] <khmer> however, in the real world, you do sometimes need some extra annotation.
[10:50:46] <khmer> i swear to GOD there's some condition that causes browsers to be unable to read the bodies of 4xx/5xx AJAX responses
[10:51:04] <khmer> otherwise, ryanneufeld, why would you be forcing your service to return an uninformative 200 even on errors?
[10:51:11] <eddiemonge> if its a problem with the data like the user is authorized to view the resource or something not related to server/network then a 200 response with a failed message and status is the preferred method
[10:51:13] <khmer> so what is that condition?
[10:51:26] <khmer> i cannot for the life of me reproduce it, and i need to, to write these unit tests.
[10:51:45] <ryanneufeld> khmer: we have a simple method
[10:52:00] <ryanneufeld> khmer: everything is 200, and we have a value that is in all json responses
[10:52:06] <ryanneufeld> khmer: result
[10:52:16] <khmer> why do you make everything 200
[10:52:18] <ryanneufeld> khmer: if result is true it's okay, if it's false then not
[10:52:19] <khmer> i don't know how else i can ask this
[10:52:23] <MikeD_> what is the recommended CDN link for jquery?
[10:52:27] <ryanneufeld> khmer: so it fucking works
[10:52:32] <khmer> why wouldn't it work?
[10:52:52] * ryanneufeld screams and runs away from the noobs
[10:52:59] <eddiemonge> ?download @ MikeD_
[10:53:00] <bot-t> MikeD_, Downloading jQuery - The code itself is written rather cleanly in an attempt to self-document. If you've spotted some areas of code that could be improved, please feel free to discuss it on the Development mailing list... http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery
[10:53:26] <eddiemonge> khmer: what errors specifically are you trying to catch/throw?
[10:53:29] <MikeD_> http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery#Current_Release
[10:53:42] <khmer> ryanneufeld: i'm sorry, i know i'm being a bit short with you, but i'm so frustrated by the events of the day, and nobody seems to understand what i'm asking. people think i'm some noob and they link me to $.ajax
[10:53:47] <MikeD_> why does the jquery.com site list 3 places?
[10:54:00] <khmer> i need to reproduce the error that you are trying to avoid by sending all 200 responses. do you understand?
[10:54:07] <ryanneufeld> MikeD_: cause you can use one of three options
[10:54:15] <Mkop> interesting. the thing that http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide57 lists as printing true, actually prints false (at least in FF8)
[10:54:26] <ryanneufeld> khmer: you need to reproduce 404s 500s etc?
[10:54:42] <ryanneufeld> is that what you're saying?
[10:54:42] <khmer> i'm sitting in a browser console and running XHRs that return 403s, and i still seem to have access to the responseText property. if that is true, then why are you returning 200s?
[10:54:43] <MikeD_> so which of those is most common - and therefor more likely to already be cached in someone's browser?
[10:55:04] <khmer> ryanneufeld: yes. i thought i wouldn't have access to the responseText property, and that that problem is why folks like you have to return 200 to everything when it's client-facing.
[10:55:23] <eddiemonge> MikeD_: probably google
[10:55:29] <khmer> but i did have that access, so i don't know wtf is going on or why
[10:55:34] <MikeD_> thanks
[10:55:40] <ryanneufeld> khmer: for us its just 'how it's done round here'
[10:55:40] <eddiemonge> Mkop: ask ajpiano about that
[10:55:48] <khmer> ok thx
[10:55:54] <khmer> i'm gonna go shoot myself in the brain
[10:56:14] <ryanneufeld> khmer: you're not explaining yourself verywell, and unless you can give an example of what you're trying to do.
[10:56:19] <ryanneufeld> khmer: it's really hard to hlep
[10:56:21] <eddiemonge> khmer: again 4xx and 5xx can send data
[10:56:22] <ryanneufeld> *help
[10:56:28] <Mkop> I figured I'd mention it here before bugging him on twitter. mentioning it here and pinging him didn't cross my mind until you pinged him :-)
[10:56:33] <ravenzz> sk8ball
[10:56:38] <khmer> how is this so hard
[10:56:40] <ravenzz> are you still there?
[10:56:54] <khmer> i don't understand at all
[10:56:57] <khmer> right here in this link
[10:56:59] <khmer> https://dev.twitter.com/docs/things-every-developer-should-know
[10:57:07] <khmer> "This parameter exists to accommodate Flash and JavaScript applications running in browsers that intercept all non-200 responses. "
[10:57:09] <ryanneufeld> khmer: they say why right there
[10:57:18] <khmer> when do they do that?
[10:57:20] <ryanneufeld> khmer: running in browsers that intercept all non-200 responses.
[10:57:21] <eddiemonge> khmer: you are making it more difficult then it is. look for example with twitter. their suppress code or whatever it is, will not get fired when there is an actual 4xx or 5xx response. like a real valid one
[10:57:28] <ryanneufeld> khmer: running in browsers that intercept all non-200 responses.
[10:57:29] <ryanneufeld> khmer: running in browsers that intercept all non-200 responses.
[10:57:30] <ryanneufeld> khmer: running in browsers that intercept all non-200 responses.
[10:57:30] <ryanneufeld> khmer: running in browsers that intercept all non-200 responses.
[10:57:32] <ryanneufeld> khmer: running in browsers that intercept all non-200 responses.

[10:57:36] <ryanneufeld> khmer: running in browsers that intercept all non-200 responses.
[10:57:38] <ryanneufeld> khmer: running in browsers that intercept all non-200 responses.
[10:57:40] <ryanneufeld> khmer: running in browsers that intercept all non-200 responses.
[10:57:43] <Corey> Enough.
[10:57:51] <khmer> christ.
[10:57:56] <khmer> there really is a communication breakdown here.
[10:58:03] <khmer> we are talking about the same thing! you just think i'm an idiot.
[10:58:07] <eddiemonge> khmer: because if there was a real network/server error twitter wouldnt even be reached
[10:58:28] <khmer> what browsers do that? how can i make a browser do that, so i can examine that error state?
[10:58:31] <Corey> Please don't do that again. :-)
[10:58:42] <khmer> that is exactly the question i'm asking.
[10:59:05] <khmer> i need to know more about that. what browsers do that? why are all the browsers i'm trying, very explicitly NOT doing that?
[10:59:11] <khmer> i must not be accurately reproducing the condition.
[10:59:16] <khmer> i needed help to reproduce that condition
[11:00:00] <eddiemonge> khmer: ok lets start over. you are building a rest api right?
[11:00:05] <khmer> yes
[11:00:06] <ryanneufeld> khmer: http://bit.ly/tV0kUz
[11:00:50] <eddiemonge> anytime a user hits your server successfully and gets the data back they will/should get a 200 response back with some data correct?
[11:01:36] <khmer> ryanneufeld: today i found out that my girlfriend's mother is dying of cancer, and yesterday i found out that my grandmother can no longer get out of bed, and the day before i found out that my girlfriend needs a thousand dollars of dental work. i am the only frontend developer on my team and i've been working 70-hour weeks. i tried very valiantly not to be a prick to you, despite the immense stressors on me. what's your excuse for not being able to ...
[11:01:42] <khmer> ... control your petulance?
[11:01:55] <khmer> eddiemonge: anyway.
[11:02:04] <wowtux> ryanneufeld, ei hello
[11:02:08] <wowtux> ryanneufeld, how are you
[11:02:20] <b-lew> is there a reason why this jquery show content is jumpy? http://mgi.turnpostadmin.com/index.php?cID=85
[11:02:22] <khmer> eddiemonge: well, for instance, if you try to hit an administrative endpoint, like /admin/something, the response should be 401 Unauthorized.
[11:02:38] <eddiemonge> khmer: hold on. im walking you though this. one step at a time
[11:03:01] <eddiemonge> khmer: ok that nvm lets go with that case
[11:03:08] <eddiemonge> yes that should be the response
[11:03:08] <khmer> eddiemonge: yes please!
[11:03:33] <eddiemonge> in those cases that can be a valid response. jquery will intercept the request as an error
[11:04:02] <eddiemonge> standard browser response would be to display whatever the data sent with that is but also show the 401 in the response header
[11:04:10] <khmer> eddiemonge: but there are apparently browsers that intercept non-200 responses.
[11:04:30] <eddiemonge> all browsers intercept that request. well not intercept but accept
[11:04:39] <khmer> eddiemonge: i tried IE7, IE9, firefox plenty of versions...i just opened an XHR and ran a request to something that i knew would return 403, and return a body
[11:04:44] <khmer> and i turned out to have access to that body.
[11:04:53] <khmer> so i cannot accurately reproduce the error i am attempting to circumvent
[11:04:54] <ryanneufeld> khmer: that's correct
[11:04:58] <khmer> that's unacceptable from a testing standpoint
[11:04:59] <eddiemonge> exactly. you have access to it because the browser does
[11:05:14] <eddiemonge> no, thats the standard. thats the part you are not understanding
[11:05:25] <ryanneufeld> khmer: so what are you trying to test then?
[11:05:38] <eddiemonge> twitter is saying that libraries like jquery and other things dont give you access to the response data
[11:05:54] <eddiemonge> so they instead send a 200 and wrap their error messages in a json output that you can parse with that library
[11:06:04] <khmer> eddiemonge: wouldn't twitter say that if that's what they meant? they said "browsers", not "libraries".
[11:06:07] <eddiemonge> *that library* thats the important part
[11:06:08] <ryanneufeld> In a predictable way
[11:06:12] <khmer> and the weird thing is, i know i've encountered this in the past.
[11:06:13] <wowtux> ryanneufeld, do u know my jquery-ui tabs show always same content on each tab
[11:06:22] <ryanneufeld> wowtux: no
[11:06:30] <eddiemonge> khmer: twitter isnt god. they arent correct and right about everything
[11:06:34] <ryanneufeld> wowtux: you probably have an html issue
[11:06:39] <wowtux> ryanneufeld, html?
[11:06:43] <khmer> eddiemonge: they happen to be a good example of what i was talking about. here's another
[11:06:46] <wowtux> ryanneufeld, ok thx i review
[11:06:54] <ryanneufeld> wowtux: your markup is probably broken somehow
[11:07:06] <khmer> eddie	http://open.convio.com/api/#main.common_parameters.html
[11:07:20] <khmer> eddiemonge: excuse me. http://open.convio.com/api/#main.common_parameters.html
[11:07:31] <khmer> there's another example of a rest provider that has a suppress_response_codes parameter.
[11:07:38] <khmer> what are all of these providers trying to avoid?
[11:07:41] <ryanneufeld> khmer: that's identical text
[11:07:59] <ProLoser|Work> my company is afraid to upgrade from jquery 1.2 to 1.4
[11:08:11] <ryanneufeld> Corey: what the heck?
[11:08:33] <ProLoser|Work> both are on the page being loaded next to each other (annoyingly) but they don't know what in the site might break if they remove the 1.2, is there a list of broken backwards compatibility?
[11:08:48] <eddiemonge> khmer: looks like twitter copied them
[11:08:57] <eddiemonge> ProLoser|Work: they should go all the way to 1.7
[11:09:02] <khmer> eddiemonge: or vice versa. i worked for them at the time, but that was a while ago
[11:09:11] <Jon47> ProLoser|Work i thnk they worked really hard to maintain backwards compatibility up through 1.7
[11:09:12] <ProLoser|Work> is bind and live and delegate still in 1.7?
[11:09:34] <Jon47> it's only just now that they are starting to talk about breaking compatibility with some old features that don't represent best practices
[11:10:07] <Jon47> bind and live and delegate are in 1.7
[11:10:11] <Jon47> although you should stop using live
[11:10:23] <eddiemonge> khmer: do you understand any of what im trying to explain at all?
[11:10:26] <sk8ball> ravenz, yeah im here
[11:10:27] <Jon47> and rely on delegate and the new on/off
[11:10:28] <cobexer> ProLoser|Work: how big is the codebase?
[11:10:29] <sk8ball> ws googling
[11:10:37] <khmer> eddiemonge: i do, yes
[11:10:55] <khmer> i'm aware that jquery sends different arguments to fail handlers than to success handlers
[11:10:58] <sk8ball> http://jqueryfordesigners.com/fixed-floating-elements/  <--- found this
[11:11:08] <khmer> i must have labored under the illusion that there is some case where xhr.responseText is unavailable
[11:11:24] <sk8ball> but it's throwing off the initial positioning
[11:11:33] <khmer> if there is no case like that, then i guess we don't have to worry about having a suppress_response_codes parameter and tunnelling the semantic http responses. is that the message i am supposed to take from you?
[11:11:55] <khmer> http response codes, that is
[11:12:17] <ravenzz> sk8ball lol http://jsfiddle.net/GXDEm/
[11:12:24] <cobexer> ProLoser|Work: i mean if its small then it's a non issue go update to the newest version right away, if it's like 50000 lines of code then it's probably better to do small incremental updates and plan to update to the newest version in a few steps
[11:12:47] <ProLoser|Work> no idea
[11:15:45] <khmer> eddiemonge: is that accurate?
[11:16:16] <eddiemonge> khmer: uh sure i think so
[11:16:29] <Meidor> anyone have any idea what I'm doing wrong/is going wrong (fiddle is here: http://jsfiddle.net/XFYKv/46/) it is working okay if i just do activitySpinner(true);activitySpinner(false) even in a function but as soon as i do activitySpinner(true); setTimeout(function(){activitySpinner(false)},1000); in a function (for example) it doesnt do what its suposed to do, okay just found out that it works if I use it as the first call but not if I first do it my self and 
[11:16:37] <sqider> sup guys, quick question, why does jquery not work in loaded content for example with .load
[11:16:49] <khmer> eddiemonge: all right, thanks
[11:16:55] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: You there?
[11:17:04] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: yeah
[11:17:06] <sk8ball> ravenz, http://www.webdevout.net/test?012
[11:17:10] <khmer> eddiemonge: are you understanding what i'm saying to you?
[11:17:13] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: "Vital! â€“ The snippets of jQuery code youâ€™ll find while  out and about on the net make extensive use of the shortcut $ to express  the jQuery global object. This isnâ€™t going to work in WordPress, so at  all times we use  jQuery(document).ready(function($) â€“ and then it will workâ€¦ Once inside the function, we can use $ as a shortcut."
[11:17:30] <eddiemonge> khmer: so another point is that the reason they do suppress is that a lot of people try to use the response codes in ways they arent supposed to.
[11:17:37] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: okay, where did you read that
[11:17:56] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: http://themocracy.com/2009/04/using-jquery-with-wordpress/
[11:17:58] <sk8ball> thats what i am using now, and you ccan see it throws off the positioning the rcontent div is supposed to be just to the right of lcontent, and lcontent should be centered on the page
[11:18:05] <sk8ball> let me try out your solution
[11:18:16] <nights> anyone know why this doesnt work? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/505938/
[11:18:18] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: I've been following this kind of stuff, or at least trying to, this whole time
[11:18:23] <sk8ball> take a look at that solution because it works, except for the positioning is off
[11:18:28] <nights> please excuse the yii code
[11:18:37] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: that's 3 years old :p
[11:19:02] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: I think they still do this kinda thing. Whether they do or not, there's more info where that came from
[11:19:07] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: I understand the guides you've been following. But I ask you this: Would trying my suggestion hurt anything?
[11:20:16] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: Actually, I'm afraid to screw with the Thematic core. That stuff gets updated, and I will lose all my efforts. So I try to go by the traditional WordPress-suggested routes. Your way probably works, but I'm no coder. What I break, I won't know how to fix.
[11:20:18] <ravenzz> sk8ball 1st of all, you should create that page so it looks fine without js
[11:20:41] <ravenzz> I commented that script and it still looks crappy
[11:20:57] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: well, then i would seek out support from them as it's their theme
[11:21:10] <Corey> ryanneufeld: You were flooding the channel and setting off network monitors. :-)
[11:21:11] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: If I can stay out of the Thematic core, that would be great. But I dun know anything about whether it would work or not
[11:21:14] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: I'm convinced of my solution, and I think you should try it.
[11:21:32] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: can I do anything within header.php alone?
[11:21:40] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: I mean, is it possible
[11:21:55] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: I can't see it, so I don't know
[11:22:17] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: I made a pastebin earlier. http://pastebin.com/NYmJJCtE
[11:22:42] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: this info might help you a whole lot: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script
[11:22:57] <ravenzz> sk8ball could copy the static.jqueryfordesigners.com/demo/fixedfloat.html one
[11:23:07] <MACscr> if i want something to apply to two different elements, cant i do something like so? $('#task-description','#client_id').change(function () {
[11:23:17] <MACscr> it doesnt seem to be working anymore
[11:23:20] <Eviltwin> MTPrower: Sounds like you nede to visit #php
[11:23:21] <MACscr> though i swear it did
[11:23:24] <cobexer> ProLoser|Work: i remember we had some problems regarding selectors for selected option elements: $('select option[selected]') ... i think that cause a problem between 1.3 and 1.4 (fixed by $('select option:selected') ), but no idea if that would apply between 1.2 and 1.7
[11:23:40] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: there is nothing wrong with using your own jquery, I'm assuming it's one of those functions that is casuing the noConflict to be added
[11:24:00] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: I think you should contact themeatic and get their help
[11:24:31] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: Alright, I will do that. Also, this page: http://themocracy.com/2010/01/more-wordpress-and-jquery/  shows that WordPress has not really changed their methods much
[11:24:56] <MACscr> nvm, figured out the issue
[11:25:46] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: k
[11:25:50] <phishbot> danheberden: have you released your html5 slide deck boilerplate yet? :D
[11:26:07] <danheberden> phishbot i'm working on that like right now, actually
[11:26:08] <danheberden> :D
[11:26:14] <ravenzz> are you still talking about wp and jquery?
[11:26:15] <zkirill> I want to generate a lot of HTML components with a web app with jQuery. Is there a convention regarding where to draw the line between doing formatting/layout in html/css and appending all elements with jQuery on-load
[11:26:15] <danheberden> i've been working on something else that will be released tomorrow morning
[11:26:20] <andrew9183> anyone ever have problems with the jquery modal dialog with the overlay being infront of the dialog, despite having a lesser z-index ?
[11:26:24] <MTPrower> ravenzz: kinda. Why?
[11:26:25] <andrew9183> only in ie7
[11:26:38] <phishbot> danheberden:  sweet!  i have  a talk to give next month so i'd LOVE to use it :D
[11:26:49] <phishbot> danheberden:  i can help you QA and do docs as well
[11:27:04] <danheberden> yeah, i have one on the 16th for jquerysummit so it's motivating me to add features i've been meaning to add
[11:27:06] <danheberden> and stuff
[11:27:20] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/103-integrating-fitvids-js-into-wordpress/
[11:27:26] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: not directly related
[11:27:30] <phishbot> danheberden:  awesome !
[11:27:36] <MTPrower> ryanneufeld: kay
[11:27:39] <ryanneufeld> MTPrower: but he explains how you can use your own jquery the wordpress way

[11:28:46] <Eviltwin> Is there a Paul Irish meme generator?
[11:28:54] <mangomango> written by paul irish?

[11:29:30] <sqider> guys what is loaded content via ajax not affected by jquery?
[11:29:32] <ravenzz> is there a version of that picture with pedobear in the bg?
[11:30:55] <ryanneufeld> paul_irish: is there any way in chrome dev tools to ignore certain errors ?
[11:31:21] <ryanneufeld> my console is spammed by SOP errors from ads, and it's kinda hard to see my output
[11:31:52] <phishbot>  
[11:31:52] <mangomango> i still get tons of "event.layerX and event.layerY" errors but i think that's cause i'm using jquery 1.4
[11:32:01] <mangomango> in chrome console
[11:32:14] <phishbot> danheberden:  is your boilerplate based off what you created here: http://danheberden.com/presentations/deferreds-putting-laziness-to-work/#20
[11:33:49] <phishbot> danheberden:  ipad support would be SO cool!  http://cl.ly/3n063q1r0S2K0u1b312D
[11:34:59] <paul_irish> ryanneufeld: there isn't
[11:35:00] <ryanneufeld> phishbot: ipad support would be killer, danheberden
[11:35:11] <ryanneufeld> paul_irish: dang, that sucks
[11:35:14] <paul_irish> well
[11:35:15] <labratt> i have a page i am display 1 post from a category and i want to be able to click a next button to load the next post â€¦ anyone have a link that will show me how?

[11:36:02] <ryanneufeld> paul_irish: you have my complete attention
[11:36:09] <ProLoser|Work> QUESTION ABOUT DEFERREEEREEREREREDS
[11:36:19] <paul_irish> http://smus.com/extending-chrome-developer-tools #Changing the product itself
[11:36:21] <ProLoser|Work> so my code has a shit-ton of functions with callback arguments
[11:36:25] <paul_irish> SWEET
[11:36:48] <ProLoser|Work> in an effort to transition to deferreds, we started returning promises, however i have code that does dfd.resolve(); callback();
[11:36:49] <ryanneufeld> paul_irish: bah! Can't you make some really cool thing to do it, like mothereffingnospaminchromeconsole.com or something?
[11:37:02] <ProLoser|Work> so it supports both passing a callback AND passing it to a when()
[11:37:04] <ProLoser|Work> etc
[11:37:07] <ryanneufeld> paul_irish: of course i kid
[11:37:19] <ProLoser|Work> however this is becoming cumbersome and annoying to manage
[11:37:21] <ProLoser|Work> what-do?
[11:37:33] <paul_irish> danheberden: ^
[11:37:34] <ProLoser|Work> and how does ajax support both deferreerererereds and also callbacks?
[11:38:08] <ProLoser|Work> paul_irish: inspector still scrolls to the top for me when i try to work :(
[11:38:19] <ProLoser|Work> it's unreliable to reproduce though :/

[11:39:27] <ryanneufeld> does onload for an iframe get called if there is no src attr?

[11:39:53] <danheberden> ProLoser|Work i don't think i'm following what you're trying to accomplish
[11:42:11] <mario-goulart> Hi.  Is this expected?
[11:42:11] <mario-goulart> $.map([1, 2, 3], function(elt){ return ([elt]);}) => [1, 2, 3]
[11:42:12] <mario-goulart> $.map([1, 2, 3], function(elt){ return (elt);}) => [1, 2, 3]
[11:42:14] <tharkun> I need to debug a jQuery problem on ie 7 how can i proceed
[11:42:37] <hobs> well thats gonna be a sacrafice to the technogods
[11:42:58] <hobs> sacrifice*
[11:44:50] <ajpiano> mario-goulart: $.map
[11:45:05] <ajpiano> the utility function - gets the args as value, index
[11:45:07] <ajpiano> instead of index.value
[11:45:56] <danheberden> mario-goulart yes, returned arrays are concat'd
[11:46:19] <ryanneufeld> would an onload for an iframe get called if there is no src attr?
[11:46:21] <ajpiano> oh and that too
[11:46:26] <srj55> i'm looking for a jquery div expander that shows a 'plus/minus' icon.  I can only find acordian style.  Can anyone point to a link?
[11:46:27] <ajpiano> flattened
[11:46:36] <mario-goulart> danheberden: and why: $.map([1, 2, 3], function(elt){ return ([[elt]]);}) => [[1], [2], [3]]
[11:46:50] <danheberden> only one level of flattening
[11:47:15] <danheberden> ?source map:
[11:47:15] <bot-t> Line#305 - "map: function( callback ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#305
[11:47:35] <mario-goulart> Is this behavior by design or a bug?
[11:48:14] <S|acker> tharkun:  http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=18359
[11:48:36] <phishbot> $.isNaN was removed in 1.7?
[11:48:48] <Eviltwin> You can just use isNaN...
[11:49:01] <phishbot> yeah
[11:49:16] <jorenl_> Hi folks, any idea why chrome cycles through an object in a different order using $.each() ?
[11:49:31] <wowtux> ryanneufeld, i review it and i find something i dont understand
[11:49:38] <Eviltwin> jorenl_: Objects haae no order
[11:49:40] <Eviltwin> have*
[11:49:44] <jbelcher> jorenl_: objects' order isn't guarenteed
[11:50:00] <jorenl_> Eviltwin, jbelcher: apparently.
[11:50:03] <phishbot> oh
[11:50:11] <wowtux> ryanneufeld, it works fine , firebug show me tab-html active and focus when i change tab to tab
[11:50:16] <phishbot> jQuery isNaN was created for null testing
[11:50:24] <wowtux> ryanneufeld, but it dont change content
[11:50:29] <phishbot> isNaN( null ) returns false
[11:50:34] <jorenl_> So there's no way to make sure I cycle through json data I received in the order the server generated it? :/
[11:50:41] <jbelcher> If you use .append() to insert both a tag and a script element that acts on that tag, will append()'s evalScript behavior execute the script before the tag hits the dom?
[11:51:00] <linuxsable> anyone know of a better work around to support this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7733044/jquery-mobile-multi-page-template-requests-wrong-page
[11:51:10] <jbelcher> jornel_: that's what arrays are for
[11:51:21] <wowtux> ryanneufeld, thing i dont understand, jquery-ui rename my tab objects id and prefix 'ui-' automatic
[11:51:48] <jorenl_> jbelcher: losing key-value style data? :S
[11:52:09] <jbelcher> unfortunately, yeah
[11:52:42] <jbelcher> if order is significant
[11:53:18] <jorenl_> but isn't key-value style data what JSON is aboutN
[11:53:21] <jorenl_> ?*
[11:54:19] <jbelcher> sure, but if order is significant the json would come through as an array of objects
[11:54:42] <jorenl_> ah, seems reasonable.
[11:56:28] <jbelcher> jorenl_: if the objects aren't the same structure you'd probably see something like [ { "type": "oldKey", "data": {â€¦}}, {"type": "anotherKey", "data":{â€¦}} ]
[11:56:34] <jbelcher> but it varies widely
[11:58:08] <wowtux> ryanneufeld, ok i fix it ;)
[11:58:12] <wowtux> ryanneufeld, already
[11:58:39] <jorenl_> jbelcher: hmm. I'll try. The problem is I've used JSON_FORCE_OBJECT on the php-side so I'll have to rework that too. Or I could make an array client side and sort it there.
[12:00:12] <jbelcher> jorenl_: yeah, by definition an object in JSON is "an unordered set of name/value pairs" (see http://json.org)
[12:01:21] <sqider> guys i've loaded content with .load but all the js scripts do not work with the loaded content, do you have any solution?
[12:04:24] <Peter2223> I want to use inline select editing http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable I have database rows and I wonder how to send row id by jQuery. Now, I think to put #id to title tag and send attr('title') but maybe is any better way to do it?
[12:07:54] <stephenjames716> hi everyone, I am trying to build a page that has a horizontal scroll as well as the ability to have a background image that re-sizes depending on how large your browser window is. On my first page I do have the horizontal scroll working well using jquery (http://blockclubonline.com/files/alec_baldwin_returns_2/index.html) but then I added another jquery script that auto-resizes the background image and it kills the function of
[12:07:54] <stephenjames716> the smooth horizontal scroll (http://blockclubonline.com/files/alec_baldwin_returns_2/background_test/index.html) If anyone could please take a look and offer any suggestions I would appreciate it. thanks
[12:08:30] <djQuery> am I using on correctly here? $('#output').on('tr','click', function(){
[12:09:02] <Eviltwin> ?on @ djQuery
[12:09:03] <bot-t> djQuery, The new jQuery 1.7+ way of handling events: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:09:17] <Eviltwin> Yes
[12:09:33] <danheberden> except the part where you want the event first
[12:09:43] <Eviltwin> Sorry, yes
[12:09:47] <Eviltwin> My bad, I misread what you wrote
[12:10:03] <danheberden> it's supposed to read the way it sounds.. "on click[ing the] tr [run] function
[12:10:04] <danheberden> "
[12:10:25] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure that the order was designed around a sentence
[12:10:34] <danheberden> Eviltwin a little bit actually
[12:11:09] <danheberden> on "action" for "thing" do "function"
[12:12:54] <dschuett> anyone know why this validation isn't wokring? - It does nothing at all... http://pastie.org/private/im0shw14pt5hsgk54kmbig
[12:13:59] <Eviltwin> dschuett: .required input means that there is an input tag somewhere nested inside a tag with class "required"
[12:14:08] <Eviltwin> If you want an input tag that has class required
[12:14:10] <Eviltwin> That's input.required
[12:15:13] <Eviltwin> Also probably not a bad idea to use $(this).find("input.required") so that you don't go outside the bounds of the form
[12:15:41] <Eviltwin> In case (eventually) there are other forms on the page that have required fields
[12:16:45] <jedimind> who's ever heard of an internets web page that has more than one required input
[12:17:08] <jedimind> also i wrote a form validator not too long ago if anyone cares to see it
[12:17:24] <Eviltwin> We don't but thanks for the offer
[12:19:12] <jedimind> fine, don't say i never offer anything
[12:20:04] <ch3mical> jedimind why do you never contribute anything to the channel?
[12:20:40] <jedimind> i do, but there's generally noone around to appreciate it when i do

[12:24:43] <KingDosser> Hi guys. Anyone on that is experienced with making plugins that could give me a bit of feedback please?
[12:25:51] <Eviltwin> KingDosser: Have you actually read that doc yet?
[12:26:03] <Eviltwin> We know from the last time you were in here that you hadn't actually read it
[12:26:12] <Eviltwin> Otherwise you would have know what you did wrong
[12:26:17] <Eviltwin> known*
[12:26:29] <KingDosser> I am pretty sure I did read it. I'll do it again just to make sure I didn't miss anything. :)
[12:26:45] <dschuett> Eviltwin: thanks for your help. I still can't seem to get it to work. Here is my modified code: http://pastie.org/private/pmrgd5gaqwlywc7flmonkg
[12:27:23] <Eviltwin> KingDosser: You need to review the Data section
[12:27:40] <jedimind> i love those
[12:27:40] <KingDosser> Eviltwin: Okay, cheers, I'll pay particular attention to that.
[12:27:46] <jedimind> "thanks for your help, but it still doesnt work"
[12:29:28] <jhchawk> hey all
[12:29:41] <Eviltwin> dschuett: What doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/AbfWB/
[12:29:50] <jhchawk> question about ColorBox (http://jacklmoore.com/colorbox/)
[12:30:11] <Eviltwin> You probably want to do a $("input.highlight").removeClass("highlight"); at the beginning
[12:30:21] <jhchawk> I'm using it on my site, and using the "rel" attribute is failing html5 validation.
[12:30:26] <Eviltwin> So that after they fix a field and resubmit, it's not highlighted any more
[12:30:39] <KingDosser> Eviltwin: Okay, I had a read but I'm not quite sure how it relates?
[12:30:42] <jhchawk> Line 74, Column 49: Bad value webdesign for attribute rel on element a: Keyword webdesign is not registered.
[12:31:02] <Eviltwin> KingDosser: Relink your plugin code
[12:31:31] <KingDosser> http://pastie.org/private/gxnczdqeketuaxzswbt3a @Eviltwin
[12:31:58] <TheMoo> csnew, you here?
[12:32:07] <jhchawk> can anyone help?
[12:32:18] <Eviltwin> You see how you have $.fn.cloud.options to store the options?
[12:32:25] <KingDosser> Eviltwin: Yeah?
[12:32:34] <Eviltwin> You'll notice that NONE of the examples do that
[12:32:43] <Eviltwin> They store that data a different way
[12:32:53] <KingDosser> I did it because I was unsure of how to make the options available to the private methods
[12:32:54] <Eviltwin> I wonder how they do it
[12:33:00] <Eviltwin> I wonder how you'd figure that out
[12:33:10] <Eviltwin> Maybe some section describes it
[12:33:16] <Eviltwin> But which
[12:33:20] <KingDosser> Lol
[12:33:59] <Eviltwin> Do you understand why $.fn.cloud.options is the wrong answer?
[12:34:24] <KingDosser> Not particularly, no?
[12:34:35] <Eviltwin> There is only one $.fn.cloud
[12:34:40] <Eviltwin> It's the one function you're defining right there
[12:34:54] <KingDosser> Okay
[12:34:55] <Eviltwin> Which means that each successive call to $.fn.cloud erases the options that were there
[12:34:58] <Eviltwin> It's like a global variable
[12:35:08] <KingDosser> Oh right.. lol fail
[12:35:47] <Eviltwin> So in order to associate data with a particular element
[12:36:10] <sqider> seriously does noone know a solution for my loading problem? asked 3 times no answer
[12:36:29] <Eviltwin> Such that $("#foo").cloud({...options here...}) and $("#foo").cloud("some later action") both act on the same separate object $("#bar").cloud({...})
[12:36:39] <Eviltwin> You use this.data()
[12:36:59] <Eviltwin> There is a full example of how it works RIGHT THERE ON THE PLUGIN AUTHORING PAGE
[12:37:04] <Eviltwin> The one I keep pointing you to
[12:37:08] <Eviltwin> And you keep saying you read
[12:37:24] <Eviltwin> If you actually read it, you would know how to do this
[12:38:15] <KingDosser> Sometimes I need a bit of help clarifying what it is saying.
[12:38:22] <KingDosser> So would 		this.data('options') = $.extend({}, defaults, options);
[12:38:22] <KingDosser> be right?
[12:38:37] <KingDosser> Or would I need to restructure it
[12:38:48] <Eviltwin> ?.data @ KingDosser
[12:38:49] <bot-t> KingDosser, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[12:39:16] <KingDosser> Yeah I thought so. I am just wondering how I would combine options with defaults in that way?
[12:39:35] <Eviltwin> The extension is right, the way you're trying to set it is wrong
[12:39:46] <Eviltwin> I wonder how you could figure out the right way

[12:47:22] <speyburn_> ryanneufeld: ill see what i can do, just a sec :)
[12:47:54] <ryanneufeld> speyburn_: also, from a php dev, echo doesn't need (), and you don't need a bajillion of them.

[12:48:35] <speyburn_> ryanneufeld: can you give me an example of how to do something like that without bajillioin echos? :) im farily new with php so..
[12:48:46] <speyburn_> ryanneufeld: yeah i totally agree

[12:50:19] <ryrych> hi
[12:50:27] <tktiddle> how do i get the ID of an element?
[12:50:33] <ryanneufeld> oic
[12:50:49] <ryrych> why can't I add newly created elements to a empty jQuery object $({}) with .add()?
[12:51:04] <ajpiano> ryrych: .add returns a new jquery object
[12:51:12] <tktiddle> tktiddle: attr()
[12:51:14] <ajpiano> you have to do var foo  = $();  foo = foo.add(".bar");
[12:51:34] <ajpiano> tktiddle, use elem.id instead of $(elem).attr("id") it's faster / less overhead
[12:51:44] <ryrych> ajpiano: ah, I see, thanks :)
[12:52:13] <csnew> ajpiano: faster?
[12:52:45] <ajpiano> csnew: it's a lot faster to access a property of an object than it is to create a jquery object and then call attr on it
[12:53:28] <csnew> ajpiano: faster? are you doing like 1000000 iterations?
[12:53:48] <ajpiano> ...
[12:53:53] <speyburn_> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/RRehS/3/ here you go, should be bit better now?
[12:54:24] <ajpiano> csnew: it's just way less overhead, every dom element will have an id property and there's no normalising you need from jquery's attr function
[12:55:02] <csnew> ajpiano: :)
[12:58:47] <syba_LT> Hello...
[12:58:56] <ProLoser|Work> i don't get how this works: http://danheberden.com/presentations/deferreds-putting-laziness-to-work/#32
[12:59:28] <ProLoser|Work> you're returning a promise OR data? how is thatâ€¦ elegant?
[12:59:44] <ProLoser|Work> i have to now check if the return value is a function or data and handle it accordingly?
[12:59:44] <syba_LT> let me see if i can explain a problem, despite my obvious lack of coding skills. I have a page with four or five divs, and the idea is to use a menu to show each div when a specific link is pressed.
[12:59:49] <SoulRaven> any ideea is in chrome is implemented watch method in javascript?
[12:59:58] <SoulRaven> i have try http://jsfiddle.net/wehWa/1/ and is not working
[13:00:06] <ryanneufeld> speyburn_: http://pastebin.com/LEQ2Cqv3
[13:00:27] <ProLoser|Work> syba_LT: sounds like tabs
[13:00:36] <ryanneufeld> speyburn_: that's the php side of it
[13:01:17] <syba_LT> I'm using a small listener, i guess its called, which uses this method   $(divname).show().siblings().hide();
[13:01:56] <syba_LT> Now, the thing is, i dont want any of the divs to be shown when i first enter the page. ... so is it safe to say that i want to put soem sort of method outsife of the listener, perhaps after, that just hides everything?
[13:02:30] <csnew> syba_LT: whats wrong with setting that up with CSS?
[13:02:31] <syba_LT> If so do you have any suggestions for how such a construct looks
[13:02:34] <speyburn_> ryanneufeld: yeah that definitely looks bit easier to understand and use, thanks :)
[13:02:34] <syba_LT> Hmmm
[13:02:42] <syba_LT> csnew: how do you mean?
[13:03:04] <csnew> syba_LT: in CSS .your-class { display:none};
[13:03:09] <syba_LT> csnew: can the divs have some sort of "normal state" which is "hidden", via a CSS ?
[13:03:22] <csnew> and be done with it, when the page loads all the elements with .your-class will be hidden
[13:03:50] <syba_LT> csnew: ah, brilliant. And they can still be shown with my listener then i suppose?
[13:03:50] <ryanneufeld> speyburn_: also the reason your not able to get the parent id, is cause dialogs get wrapped with extra divs by jquery-ui
[13:03:51] <csnew> syba_LT: there is a lot you can do with CSS, just have to think outside the box ;)
[13:04:22] <csnew> syba_LT: yeah, when you need them with javascript (not just with jQuery) $(".your-css").show();
[13:04:27] <csnew> syba_LT: and be done with it
[13:04:48] <ryanneufeld> speyburn_: check out the console http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/RRehS/5/

[13:05:29] <lessthanzero> I have a script that is timing out & causing firefox to crash (and chrome etc) - I'm wondering if anyone has any tips for troubleshooting exacting what is doing it. I'm slowly narrowing down what code is throwing error (by commenting out source) but I'd LOVE to see and error (but can't as browser crashed before firebug comes back responsive)
[13:05:51] <ryanneufeld> SoulRaven: check out ben almans hooker for js
[13:06:07] <speyburn_> ryanneufeld: okay, im actually using firebug, but im fairly new with it also
[13:06:15] <speyburn_> ill take a look at it
[13:06:18] <ryanneufeld> speyburn_: good, that's very good
[13:06:42] <ryanneufeld> use console.log instead of alert, alert is blocking, so it can cause other problems
[13:06:47] <djQuery> dang tablesorter   its not allowing me to clear the table rows.
[13:06:56] <speyburn_> ryanneufeld: do you think that i just have to nest parent()'s untill i get to the needed parent?
[13:06:58] <rubial> well how can i set the page a background image which covers the whole screen of mobile device even if image is smaller
[13:06:59] <lessthanzero> Any advice on troubleshooting script that crashes entire browser?
[13:07:21] <ryanneufeld> speyburn_: what is the problem you're trying to solve? why do you need that id?
[13:07:31] <LuckySMack> when using $.each to iterate over an array, is there a keyword I can use to refer to the current key I am on?

[13:07:45] <bot-t> LuckySMack, .each() - Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[13:08:02] <ryanneufeld> ?jquery.each() @LuckySMack
[13:08:03] <bot-t> LuckySMack, jQuery.each(collection, callback): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[13:08:06] <LuckySMack> I want to be able to do myArray.split(currentId, 1); to remove the current element if needed
[13:08:13] <djQuery> any one have an easy table sorter that is ui theme capable
[13:08:22] <ryanneufeld> LuckySMack: read the docs, it explains how to get an index :p
[13:08:43] <ryanneufeld> LuckySMack: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/ <- read this, it answers your question :)
[13:08:43] <Roritharr> hi guys

[13:08:53] <LuckySMack> yea im on there. thanks.
[13:09:03] <Roritharr> how would i go about using jquery for a different iframe by id?
[13:09:09] <Roritharr> something like $('#edit-subline',$('#mediaStyleSelector')).val();

[13:11:06] <ragas> im using chatzilla, a ff extension, on mac;  is there a keyboard shortcut to switch me back to my browser window?

[13:11:18] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/RRehS/6/
[13:11:22] <csnew> ragas: tab key?
[13:12:06] <ragas> command tab switches applications, but not windows within an application
[13:12:21] <LuckySMack> ok see i was using it correct. but the element seems to not be getting deleted. http://paste.pocoo.org/show/505996/
[13:12:32] <jedimind> ragas, ctrl+tab
[13:12:41] <LuckySMack> basically if that elements value is undefined, it should be removed
[13:12:48] <ragas> cntl tab switches me to another chat tab
[13:12:48] <jedimind> or ... use your mouse?
[13:12:56] <ragas> yeah, using the mouse sucks
[13:13:22] <jedimind> ctrl+# should work
[13:13:30] <speyburn_> ryanneufeld: okay :) ill take a good look at that and google a bit so i maybe learn something new :)
[13:13:37] <jedimind> like ctrl+1 should go to the first tab
[13:13:42] <jedimind> or command+1
[13:13:53] <jedimind> ben!
[13:13:57] <speyburn_> ryanneufeld: thanks for now :), ill ask if i run into problems!
[13:14:29] <djQuery> having a problem with tablesorter, it doesnt allow me to clear the rows of the table. http://jsbin.com/oquxuk/26/edit
[13:14:44] <ragas> also just switches tabs
[13:14:48] <djQuery> is there a why to do a destroy on table sorter to clear its cache?
[13:15:36] <djQuery> or anyone have a different table sorter?
[13:16:38] <ryanneufeld> speyburn_: yup, np
[13:17:47] <dnsdds> In a jQuery UI sortable that's connected to other sortables, how can I select the original and the new sortable in the stop event?
[13:20:01] <KingDosser> Is it possible to chain .extend and .data so that I can put the combined array (say for defaults + options) into data ?
[13:20:51] <ajpiano> KingDosser: $(this).data( "options", $.extend( {}, defaults, options ) );
[13:20:54] <ajpiano> it's not "chaining"
[13:21:00] <ajpiano> it's... javascript
[13:21:34] <ravenzz> does the console collect the errors into an object?
[13:22:21] <KingDosser> Cheers ajpiano
[13:23:13] <SoulRaven> is any watch object equivalent in chorme ?
[13:23:14] <SoulRaven> http://jsfiddle.net/xgCn4/2/
[13:23:30] <SoulRaven> i can't get to work this code in chrome
[13:24:10] <SoulRaven> and chrome i don't thing is suport .watch() method
[13:27:42] <LuckySMack> if I am iterating over an Array object with jQuery.each(myArray, function(index, value){...}); shouldn't i be able to delete one of those elements with: 'delete myArray[index];' ?
[13:30:26] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to find when a variabile or an object has been changed?
[13:30:30] <ajpiano> LuckySMack: no
[13:30:42] <ajpiano> LuckySMack: you can't do delete on an array
[13:30:53] <KingDosser> ajpiano: Do yu know how I could access data('options') in the private functions: http://pastie.org/private/cxebntsaib6h04cyh3u37g
[13:30:55] <ajpiano> you can use splice or something
[13:31:06] <LuckySMack> i tried using this too: models.splice(index, 1);
[13:31:14] <ajpiano> KingDosser: use .call when you invoke all your private functions
[13:31:27] <ajpiano> so that the 'this' is the 'this' you want it to me
[13:31:28] <LuckySMack> but after the each block when i logged the array, all the elements were still there
[13:31:30] <ajpiano> ?mdc call @ KingDosser
[13:31:31] <bot-t> KingDosser, call - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[13:31:53] <ajpiano> LuckySMack: typically you don't want to remove things from an array while it's being iterated, you'd want to do that after the iteration
[13:32:14] <ohsnap> If i have an element with no background set, and animate it's color to #fff how can I go back to no background afterwards?
[13:32:28] <ohsnap> is it possible?
[13:32:38] <ajpiano> KingDosser: or you can pass the entire jquery object to your private functions
[13:32:41] <ajpiano> instead of just passing the ID
[13:32:50] <ajpiano> then you can just do someArg.data("whatever")
[13:32:55] <KingDosser> is that a good way to do it though
[13:32:56] <KingDosser> ?
[13:32:58] <ajpiano> ohsnap: removeAttr("style")
[13:33:04] <ajpiano> KingDosser: yes
[13:33:15] <KingDosser> Okay cheers ajpiano
[13:33:18] <ohsnap> ajpiano: thanks :)
[13:33:22] <ajpiano> KingDosser: if all you're passing is the id, you're essentially losing information on purpose
[13:33:31] <KingDosser> oh i see
[13:33:31] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to find when a variabile or an object has been changed?
[13:33:35] <ohsnap> removeAttr("backgroundColor") ?
[13:33:42] <ajpiano> KingDosser: doing $(this).attr("id") and then passing it to a function where you in turn to do $("#"+ id) is terrible
[13:33:52] <ajpiano> you can just pass the reference itself
[13:33:55] <ajpiano> ohsnap: no
[13:34:08] <ajpiano> ohsnap: animation affects the inline style attribute of an element
[13:34:16] <ajpiano> delete the style attribute and any changes applied by animations should be gone
[13:34:29] <ohsnap> oh
[13:34:32] <ohsnap> I get it
[13:35:00] <ajpiano> OH SNAP
[13:35:01] <ajpiano> he gets it
[13:35:07] <ajpiano> ?dyswidt
[13:35:08] <bot-t> did you see what i did thereâ€½
[13:35:11] <ohsnap> lol
[13:36:29] <LuckySMack> ok, well maybe I can build the array better then. basically i have a string like so : " '3':'foo';'5':'bar' " and I use split on ';' and then again on ':' to take them as key/values and store them into an array. i use .each on the second part ('3':'foo') and save them as key/value pairs in a new array. but rather than just having an array with the two key of 3 and 5, it has 5 values and 1,2,4 are all undefined.
[13:36:55] <LuckySMack> let me try to paste an example.
[13:37:24] <ngharo> mdn down? :(
[13:38:03] <ohsnap> ajpiano: can i use rgba to animate to the transparency?
[13:38:15] <ohsnap> instead of removing the style attrib?
[13:38:27] <ajpiano> you can try, using the jquery color plugin
[13:38:32] <ajpiano> brb ihave to go walk in the rain
[13:39:37] <ohsnap> ok! thanks!
[13:42:21] <LuckySMack> ajpiano: this is what I'm doing: http://pastie.org/2844022
[13:43:54] <ajpiano> so many globals
[13:44:03] <ajpiano> LuckySMack: you should be using objects instead of arrays
[13:44:10] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to find when a variabile or an object has been changed?
[13:44:27] <SoulRaven> i have try with .watch() but is not suported in chrome
[13:44:46] <KingDosser> ajpiano: I am getting huge lag spikes now. How would I find out where the leak is?
[13:45:03] <LuckySMack> ajpiano: pfft, that makes sense. when i change to an object it works. thanks.
[13:45:05] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: not without some magical enhancements that make items observable assuming you use the api
[13:45:19] <ajpiano> LuckySMack: np
[13:45:22] <ajpiano> KingDosser: i have no idea
[13:45:35] <ajpiano> the change we made would have nothing to do with 'lag spikes' or memory leaks
[13:45:42] <cakehero> ProLoser|Work what screencast software did we use to chat?
[13:45:47] <ajpiano> all we did was pass $(this) instead of $(this).attr("id") to a func

[13:45:50] <SoulRaven> ajpiano: any ideea in this matter?
[13:46:00] <KingDosser> ajpiano: I also changed to .call

[13:48:24] <digitalfiz> ah hah!
[13:48:39] <KingDosser> Oh woops sorry ajpiano: http://pastie.org/private/ssuvdvv5awwggmmyyu40og
[13:49:43] <KingDosser> the error is: too much recursion
[13:51:43] <djQuery> anyone know if a good table sorter?
[13:52:42] <ajpiano> KingDosser: you *really* didn't need to mix these two things together
[13:52:55] <ajpiano> it was *either* call it in a particular scope ('this') or pass the jquery object
[13:53:04] <ajpiano> not... invoke the private function in the scope of the jquery object, passing it this
[13:53:09] <ajpiano> lol
[13:53:10] <ajpiano> KingDosser:
[13:53:14] <ajpiano> you didn't change your private functions at all
[13:53:15] <ajpiano> ...
[13:53:31] <ajpiano> if animateItem(item) used to take a string of the id
[13:53:34] <ajpiano> and now you are passing a jquery object
[13:53:41] <ajpiano> you would have to adjust the code accordingly
[13:53:49] <ajpiano> this is known as "applying critical thinking skills to a problem"
[13:55:27] <KingDosser> ajpiano: I didn't change what was passed to the methods, I just sent the this object in the .call didn't I?

[13:56:08] <ajpiano> yes you did
[13:56:12] <ProLoser|Work> i have a question about the following snippet: http://danheberden.com/presentations/deferreds-putting-laziness-to-work/#32
[13:56:17] <ajpiano> KingDosser: read about how call works
[13:56:18] <cakehero> k
[13:56:18] <ProLoser|Work> i don't understand how this is supposed to works
[13:56:25] <ProLoser|Work> it either returns data or a promise object
[13:56:28] <ProLoser|Work> how is that supposed to work?
[13:56:31] <ajpiano> the subsquent arguments to call are passed as the arguments to function
[13:56:35] <ajpiano> so now you were passing dom element instead of jquery
[13:56:42] <ajpiano> intstead of string*
[13:57:10] <SoulRaven> ajpiano: any ideea how i monitor when an aobject has been changed? without using watch method, because is not avalible in chrome
[13:57:10] <MaSo> http://www.cn234.net
[13:57:14] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: no
[13:57:21] <ajpiano> you have to use some kind of API
[13:57:25] <ajpiano> that makes objects observable
[13:57:30] <ajpiano> they aren't natively unless that watch method is
[13:57:32] <ajpiano> ...
[13:57:43] <ProLoser|Work> can someone answer some questions i have regarding deferreds?
[13:57:57] <SoulRaven> in chrome watch is not avalibile :(
[13:57:59] <ajpiano> now i haev to go back to the office
[13:58:36] <ryanneufeld> ?ask @ ProLoser|Work
[13:58:37] <bot-t> ProLoser|Work, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:58:53] <djQuery> anyone have experience clearing the cache for tablesorter its causing me issues with clearing the rows fo the tbody
[14:00:41] <dandaman1> hey all
[14:00:48] <dandaman1> anyone have experience with the datatables plug in?
[14:00:57] <dandaman1> i want to have an alert pop up after the table is filled out
[14:01:06] <dandaman1> IE, once the ajax call is returned
[14:01:24] <djQuery> then just do it in the ajax success, and alerts suck
[14:01:31] <ProLoser|Work> ryanneufeld: scroll up
[14:01:45] <dandaman1> djQuery: well i'm not using an alert, its for testing purposes
[14:01:59] <dandaman1> djQuery: also, its not an ajax call
[14:02:03] <ProLoser|Work> I don't understand how this is supposed to work: http://danheberden.com/presentations/deferreds-putting-laziness-to-work/#32 it either returns data or it returns a promise object right?
[14:02:09] <djQuery> dandaman1: then console.log
[14:02:14] <dandaman1> its $(table).dataTable({options})
[14:02:35] <djQuery> ?ftjq@dandaman1
[14:02:35] <bot-t> dandaman1, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[14:02:38] <dandaman1> i tried $(table).dataTable({options},function(){alert('sup')}
[14:02:54] <dandaman1> with the ) to close it
[14:03:10] <dandaman1> djQuery: ok fine, i need to set a variable....
[14:03:24] <ryanneufeld> ProLoser|Work: yes
[14:03:27] <dandaman1> I don't want the data table to be called until it's done with its previous call
[14:05:05] <ProLoser|Work> so am i supposed to handle the 2 scenarios differently?
[14:05:10] <ProLoser|Work> it seems like extra work
[14:06:12] <shintaku> is there a pattern for writing a jquery plugin that depends on two elements?  I wouldn't even know the interface looks like.  I could do something like $("#foo").myplugin($("#other"));  but was wondering if there was a better pattern for it.
[14:06:37] <shintaku> for example, let's say i want to circle #other around #foo
[14:06:49] <davidmccabe> rs
[14:06:56] <davidmccabe> s/rs//
[14:07:30] <davidmccabe> When applying the shake effect to a textarea, it loses focus. Is there a way to avoid this? Thanks.
[14:07:42] <dandaman1> nevermind, the datatable plug in does all the calls on its own...crap
[14:08:25] <ryanneufeld> ProLoser|Work: no
[14:08:41] <paul____> anyone know why when i apply a css scale transform to a draggable then it seems like draggable thinks the starting point of the drag should be scaled w/o the css ?
[14:08:47] <ryanneufeld> ProLoser|Work: http://danheberden.com/presentations/deferreds-putting-laziness-to-work/#33
[14:08:49] <paul____> or how to fix it?
[14:08:57] <ryanneufeld> ProLoser|Work: read the next slide, he goes on :)
[14:09:11] <paul____> the effect is that the element jumps on drag begin
[14:13:28] <ProLoser|Work> ryanneufeld: i read the whole thing, still doesn't make sense to me
[14:14:23] <Hopsy> Hey, does anyone know an api for poll systems?
[14:14:34] <ProLoser|Work> is it just because $.when() handles both callbacks AND vars?
[14:14:41] <ProLoser|Work> cuz what if i don't want to use $.when()
[14:14:50] <ProLoser|Work> it seems like you are making $.when() a dependency
[14:16:16] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: if you pass something that isn't observable to $.when() then it is treated as already resolved
[14:16:30] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: the advantage of this is that you can pass functions that may or may not be asynchronous
[14:16:52] <ProLoser|Work> but what if you don't want to depend on $.when()
[14:16:56] <ajpiano> huh
[14:17:09] <ProLoser|Work> i mean that's nice and all, but now I am REQUIRED to use $.when() to access the template, right?
[14:17:23] <ProLoser|Work> i can't just do name = getName()
[14:17:26] <ajpiano> what template are we even talking about here
[14:17:29] <ProLoser|Work> or getName().done()
[14:17:49] <ajpiano> so?
[14:17:49] <ProLoser|Work> s/template/name/
[14:18:00] <ProLoser|Work> well that seems like a strange restriction
[14:18:03] <ajpiano> you write the code that your application dictates is necessary
[14:18:19] <ProLoser|Work> so it is an acceptable requirement to always use $.when() to access data in that fn?
[14:18:24] <ajpiano> if you have a condition when your data may or may not already be available, then yes, you have a "depedency" on $.when
[14:18:36] <dw> does jQuery have a .setVisible(bool) type call? like .show() / .hide() depending on a bool
[14:18:56] <ajpiano> dw: .toggle( bool );
[14:19:06] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: yes
[14:19:07] <dw> ajpiano: nice!
[14:19:09] <dw> <3
[14:19:13] <ProLoser|Work> :/
[14:19:22] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: lol
[14:19:30] <ProLoser|Work> i guess if i wanted to change caching to match how he does it, i'd have to refactor a fair chunk of code
[14:19:40] <ProLoser|Work> just so every single one uses when
[14:19:45] <ajpiano> coding is hard, let's go shopping
[14:20:11] <danheberden> SHOPPING BREAK EVERYBODY
[14:20:15] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: If I have 3 ajax calls fire off the asme time and I need to an action when all 3 are completed, what's the best way to go about that?
[14:20:53] <Dave_Stein> it would seem like some deffered thing but then it seems like .when( ( a & b & c ) , callback );
[14:21:12] <danheberden> Dave_Stein $.when( a, b, c ).done( fn )
[14:21:16] <dw> ok, and one more: is there a call equivalent to   elem.children.remove() ; elem.append(content)   where content is a DOM object, not a chunk of HTML
[14:21:17] <ajpiano> $.when( a(), b(), c() ).then( fn );
[14:21:24] <tcatm> hey. when using jQuery.getJSON("/foo.json", callback) can I pass custom arguments to my callback() function other than the returned json object?
[14:21:34] <ajpiano> dw, .html( el ) will work just fine
[14:21:51] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: if a() is a function that does an ajax call, how does when know a() is done
[14:22:02] <danheberden> dw: elem.empty().append( el )
[14:22:06] <dw> ajpiano: that's not in the docs. does it preserve the DOM object, or does it htmlify it first
[14:22:18] <ajpiano> it preserves it but might clone if there are multiple destinations
[14:22:22] <dw> danheberden: that looks better. although i hate the chaining
[14:22:25] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: because it is "observable"
[14:22:29] <danheberden> dw then don't chain
[14:22:41] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: aka... "that is how it works"
[14:22:52] <dw> ajpiano: ok, that'll suffice. thanks
[14:22:52] <danheberden> Dave_Stein if the function were to run the ajax call, you just need to be sure to return the ajax call
[14:23:00] <ajpiano> oh, that
[14:23:03] <danheberden> e.g. function a() { return $.ajax( opts ); }
[14:23:06] <Dave_Stein> ahh thanks dan
[14:23:07] <ajpiano> yeah, you just would have fun... ^^
[14:23:14] <danheberden> so that the promise is returned to when
[14:23:20] <danheberden> the promise lets it be 'observable'
[14:23:30] <ryanneufeld> and when you return the cached data?
[14:23:44] <danheberden> when will not get a promise but a result
[14:23:51] <danheberden> thus, fire right away
[14:23:59] <Dave_Stein> and then if b() wasn't an AJAX call for some reason it knows when its done just by returning a value i'd imagine?
[14:24:02] <ryanneufeld> passing that result to the done function?
[14:24:07] <danheberden> yuppers
[14:24:28] <ryanneufeld> see, that's the part that's hard to wrap ones head around reading the docs
[14:24:33] <danheberden> $.when( "what you talking about willis?" ).done( function(a){ a== "what you talking about willis?"; /* true */ } )
[14:24:44] <Dave_Stein> awesome
[14:25:03] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: sessy
[14:25:42] <Dave_Stein> been meaning to askthat for a while
[14:25:54] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: thanks for explaining that
[14:26:15] <dabear> what if you have multiple conditions to when?
[14:26:18] <dabear> arguments*
[14:26:32] <dw> i have one more helper: makeUrl(path, params) which turns ("blah", {a:1}) into blah?a=1   and  ("blah?a=1", {b:2})  into blah?a=1&b=2  .. is there a built in way to do that?
[14:26:50] <amh345> is toggle() only for show/hide?     i was trying to use it to trigger other functions.   whats the best way to do  $("#my_btn").click(function(event) { //do set cookie        and $("#my_btn").click(function(event) { //do delete cookie ??
[14:27:03] <danheberden> dabear depends - if it's just one arg, you'll get it in the same order with your function params... $.when( a(), b() ).done( function( returnedFromA, returnedFromB );
[14:27:07] <ryanneufeld> dabear: $.when( "what you talking","about willis?" ).done( function(a,b){ a== "what you talking";b=="about willis?"; /* true */ } )
[14:27:25] <devOlsen> Gary Coleman reference = +1
[14:27:30] <danheberden> in the case of, say, $.ajax, it returns an array
[14:28:02] <dabear> okok, so you need to do  Array.prototype.slice(arguments, 0) to get the  returned values then
[14:28:18] <dabear> if you don't know how many arguments to .when there was
[14:28:38] <dabear> would be much better if a was an array of returned values
[14:29:45] <danheberden> dabear if you don't know how many args to when, that sounds like a poor architectural decision
[14:29:47] <ryanneufeld> dabear: or you could use arguments.pop()
[14:29:59] <danheberden> but it's not like you can't get that info
[14:31:10] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: I think I'm gonna rewrite some code when I get home now
[14:31:18] <dabear> danheberden: this was a theoretical problem. but under developing you might find that you need another argument to .when, so a loop inside the .done callback could be easier than having to check each argument
[14:31:46] <ryanneufeld> currently I'm returning a promise somewhere, that I could probably be using the $.when for
[14:32:02] <Dave_Stein> danheberden: I think I missed something, but what does "done" get as passed arguments when all 3 ajax calls are done?
[14:32:56] <danheberden> in the case that just one arg is used for when, the resolve function will get a matching argument/paramter set: $.when( $.ajax() ).done( function(a,b,c) { a; /* the data */ b; /* the success string */, c; /* the jqXHR */ ); - if multiple, $.when( $.ajax() , $.ajax() ).done( function(a,b,c) { a[0]; /* the data */ a[1]; /* the success string */, a[2]; /* the jqXHR */; b; /* another 3 element array */ c; /* undefined */  );
[14:33:37] <Dave_Stein> crazy but got it
[14:33:44] <ryanneufeld> oh, that's clever...
[14:33:52] <dabear> wow, great, you can't actually know how many arguments was passed to .when from the .done callback then
[14:33:55] <dabear> ?
[14:34:07] <Dave_Stein> you can use the arguments keyword and figure that out
[14:34:07] <ryanneufeld> dabear: yes, you can, you're the one writing it
[14:34:10] <dabear> unless you inspect the contents of a,b and c
[14:34:14] <Dave_Stein> if it was were dynamic for some reason
[14:34:15] <dabear> sure sure
[14:34:22] <Dave_Stein> but to ryan's point
[14:34:24] <Dave_Stein> you're writing it :)
[14:35:51] <ryanneufeld> dabear: <sarcasm>There is a certain amount of cognitive effort that goes in to coding.</sarcasm>
[14:37:54] <danheberden> dabear you can make your own when if you wanted to
[14:37:59] <danheberden> make a dfd that exposes a public count
[14:38:11] <danheberden> if that's something you need for your app, just build it silly :p
[14:38:44] <Dave_Stein> I wonder what the chances are of $.numeric getting an option to disallow strings/hexes
[14:39:05] <Dave_Stein> i have my own isValidNumber function I was hoping to swap out, but we use it for IDs of things, which would never be hex or exponential
[14:41:30] <dabear> you'd need an isYourMomBadAss function too, for those special occasions
[14:43:07] <coldhead> can anyone please kill me
[14:43:11] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[14:43:18] * djQuery shoots coldhead
[14:43:20] <Dave_Stein> coldhead: that's a lie, i can kill you
[14:43:20] * danheberden holds coldhead's hair back
[14:43:37] <danheberden> he's just had too much to drink kids, don't be alarmed
[14:43:42] <coldhead> you wonderful fellows
[14:43:46] <coldhead> i love you guys
[14:44:15] <coldhead> well well well, KingDosser's back for some more sweet sweet candy
[14:44:15] <Hopsy> coldhead: we should lock you up
[14:44:17] <coldhead> bam
[14:44:30] <KingDosser> you know you love it, coldhead :)
[14:44:38] <coldhead> if you had only killed me 20 years ago we wouldn't be in this mess, Hopsy
[14:45:44] <Hopsy> coldhead: 'cus you created all of the problems in this world?
[14:46:06] <coldhead> i am a party to them, yes
[14:46:24] <Hopsy> by the way, what will do usa with iran?
[14:47:00] <Hopsy> does iran got nucleair stuff?
[14:47:08] <ccmonster> how do i see the full url that the $.ajax request is making? /
[14:47:14] <ekkis> anyone out there using jquery UI tabs?  I have a problem... see: http://jsfiddle.net/tmLZS/
[14:47:26] <KingDosser> Why does console.log and console.warn sometimes not work in firebug?
[14:47:48] <zkirill> What's the best way of implementing "magnetic pull" to draggable jQuery UI elements. For example when the draggable is in proximity to droppable it automatically falls into place without waiting for user to lift the mouse button.
[14:47:49] <ekkis> ccmonster: you're calling it, so you should know...
[14:48:17] <ekkis> zkirill: that's a scary notion
[14:48:33] <ccmonster> seriously.. lol. I am asking to see the request url.
[14:48:49] <ccmonster> have you used the $.ajax method before? ....
[14:48:58] <Phoenixz> Im using jquery.load(url, function(){alert('a');}); for an onclick event. First time I click, the alert() executes.. Second time, it doesnt.. Any reason why it may not execute?
[14:49:20] <last1> anyone uses SparkBox for their select inputs ?
[14:49:23] <ccmonster> there is more the the $.ajax than url:'this.com/blah.html', i wnat to see what the fully rendered url is goign to be.
[14:49:40] <ekkis> ccmonster: well, you pass an object to that method, the contents of which you know.  I obviously don't understand your question
[14:50:03] <KingDosser> coldhead: http://pastie.org/private/odrvuty6u6p3nxtdselmqa PLEASE tell me why it's saying that newItem is undefined on line 113?
[14:50:06] <ekkis> Phoenixz: caching?
[14:50:13] <ekkis> how do you know it doesn't execute?
[14:50:17] <CodeZombie> hey, on window.resize, if I ouput the value of $('body').height(), the value is added to the previous value. That doesn't seem right, does it?
[14:50:18] <zkirill> ekkis: that was a bad idea agreed
[14:50:21] <coldhead> nuclear*
[14:50:37] <ccmonster> yes you do ekkis , and that object is rendered into a full xhr request.
[14:50:43] <ccmonster> i want to see that full request url.
[14:50:59] <ekkis> oh... I see
[14:51:00] <coldhead> Hopsy: it doesn't really matter if iran has nukes, everyone else does anyway. meanwhile yoghurt can kill you. we're not even safe in our refrigerators
[14:51:06] <CodeZombie> nvm, must be something in my code
[14:51:17] <ekkis> ccmonster: I guess you would know it at the other end
[14:51:52] <ekkis> CodeZombie: output means//
[14:51:54] <coldhead> KingDosser: you really don't want to say "newItem()". it's javascript, just pass the name of the function directly, without the quotes or the ()
[14:51:56] <ekkis> means?
[14:52:41] <coldhead> KingDosser: i think if you "quote" it it will look for window.newItem(), which doesn't exist
[14:55:22] <Phoenixz> ekkis: The url contains '?r' + Math.random() to avoid that
[14:55:37] <KingDosser> coldhead: Omg my code is being gay.
[14:55:44] <devc> I'm confused with how the .load() method works, when you're working with images...
[14:55:44] <devc> I
[14:55:46] <Phoenixz> ekkis: Even so, that function should be executed, not?
[14:55:59] <CodeZombie> ekkis: https://gist.github.com/bf23e790335b789a1f41
[14:56:11] <devc> I'm using .addClass() until the .load() function fires then invoking removeClass()
[14:56:20] <ekkis> Phoenixz: yes... even if cached, the function should execute
[14:56:31] <CodeZombie> when I comment out line 11, the value is no longer added together, however, with line 11 uncommented, the value just increases
[14:56:40] <CodeZombie> the value I'm speaking of is $('body').height()
[14:56:48] <Phoenixz> ekkis: So what might be a reason why the function is not executing at all?
[14:56:50] <coldhead> i assume you mean in the festive sense, KingDosser
[14:56:53] <danheberden> btw dabear: http://jsfiddle.net/danheberden/PPJcL/
[14:56:55] <coldhead> not the pejorative
[14:57:04] <devc> Which works the first time you load the image. The next time, we addClass() but because .attr('src') is the same, .load() never fires.
[14:57:04] <Hopsy> coldhead: thats also true yes
[14:57:05] <CodeZombie> oops
[14:57:21] <KingDosser> coldhead: Sure
[14:57:23] <ekkis> Phoenixz: maybe the .load() isn't executing...
[14:58:30] <Phoenixz> ekkis: well, I have a console.log() right before the function, in the function (1st line), and after the function... First click gives ABC, next gives AC...
[14:58:54] <ekkis> CodeZombie: I don't see how it would "add up"
[14:59:02] <CodeZombie> ekkis: me either
[14:59:13] <CodeZombie> but if I run console.log(new_height) the value is getting larger
[15:00:00] <ekkis> CodeZombie: one odd thing: line 8 redeclares the variable
[15:00:32] <CodeZombie> ekkis: I fixed that in the gist, if you refresh
[15:02:12] <ekkis> CodeZombie: question: what happens if you declare content_height as a regular function?
[15:02:22] <ekkis> e.g. function content_height() {}
[15:02:31] <knightbattle> hi there
[15:02:44] <CodeZombie> ekkis: same thing
[15:02:52] <amitprakash> Hi, any idea how I can run jquery ui functions in firebug?
[15:03:27] <amitprakash> i.e. I have a page using jquery ui datepicker.. and I want to debug the ui function via firebug
[15:04:08] <danheberden> amitprakash init the date picker from console? set a break point? console.log inside of the function?
[15:04:18] <danheberden> ?ftj @ amitprakash
[15:04:19] <bot-t> amitprakash, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[15:04:37] <CodeZombie> ekkis: the values in the console come out correct, as long as I comment out the line that sets the content elements height
[15:04:38] <KingDosser> coldhead: Could you pretty please look at this: http://pastie.org/private/odrvuty6u6p3nxtdselmqa
[15:04:42] <CodeZombie> I just don't get it
[15:04:48] <KingDosser> Basically, it's not creating new items.
[15:06:55] <paul____> anyone know how to fix the fact that when i apply a css scale transform to a draggable then it seems like draggable thinks the starting point of the drag should be scaled w/o the css ? the effect right now is that the element jumps on drag begin
[15:07:17] <ProLoser|Work> uhâ€¦ example?
[15:07:48] <coldhead> KingDosser: this still hasn't fixed the thing i was talkign about
[15:07:56] <coldhead> setTimeout("newItem()",1); -> setTimeout(newItem,1);
[15:08:02] <coldhead> pay more and better attention
[15:08:14] <KingDosser> I have fixed that sorry, just that's an old version of code. My bad.
[15:08:19] <amitprakash> danheberden, will look into firequery... I have a breakpoint but while $( 'selector').jquery_functions work fine in watch/console.. .jquery_ui_functions cause firebug to say DOM element has no such jquery_ui_function
[15:08:42] <danheberden> amitprakash sounds like you don't have jquery ui included on the page properly
[15:08:47] <KingDosser> coldhead: http://pastie.org/private/69i6dei8qndi0jzqc4uua
[15:08:52] <CodeZombie> is there a jquery event for stopping window.resize?
[15:08:55] <last1> anyone using fancybox ?
[15:09:10] <amitprakash> danheberden, thats weird given the given function is working almost as intended on the page
[15:09:22] <Phoenixz> ekkis: Ah, crap, found the problem.. The CSS selector would select on class.. Inside the load function, the class would change, so the second CSS selector didnt get anything to load into..
[15:09:27] <danheberden> if the function isn't there, sounds like you got some craziness going on
[15:09:30] <danieliser> i have an <li><a></a></li> with a .click on the li. I have return false in it but the link still fires and changes pages.
[15:09:44] <coldhead> got a live demo, KingDosser? because this is working fine in my imagination
[15:09:48] <ravenzz> ?preventdefault @ danieliser

[15:09:57] <coldhead> i'm very wary of setTimeout(.., 1)
[15:10:02] <coldhead> why even wait
[15:10:07] <coldhead> why not just called newItem again
[15:10:08] <ekkis> Phoenixz: aha
[15:10:16] <KingDosser> coldhead: I suppose i don't have to.
[15:10:28] <ravenzz> danieliser bind the click event to the a element
[15:10:54] <danheberden> event.preventDefault will work on a bubbled event just fine
[15:10:57] <michaeln_> hi everyone, any idea how to get the valHooks ? as in jquery.val() - http://api.jquery.com/val/
[15:11:18] <paul____> ProLoser|Work:  do you mean me that i should give an example?
[15:11:19] <ekkis> anyone here use tabs?  I need to resize them and I can't figure out how... here's fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/tmLZS/
[15:11:24] <paul____> i can upload one somewhere
[15:11:27] <michaeln_> the problem i have is I have a textarea, on save, i append the text , the line break does not show
[15:11:30] <danheberden> michaeln_ $.valHooks ?
[15:11:36] <paul____> ProLoser|Work:  sry for the delay
[15:11:53] <danheberden> ?p @ paul____
[15:11:53] <bot-t> paul____, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:12:03] <paul____> danheberden:  thanks!
[15:12:35] <michaeln_> danheberden: i thought i declare the valHooks and my $('textarea').val() will include the line break ?
[15:13:01] <danheberden> michaeln_ wat - i must have missed a previous part of your explanation/problem
[15:13:08] <KingDosser> coldhead: It doesn't seem that JSFiddle is working for this.
[15:13:32] <danheberden> KingDosser keep your voice down, jsfiddle can hear you
[15:13:41] <amitprakash> danheberden, ok fixed it.. code execution is fine at breakpoint but not so outside breakpoints ... [ was basically trying to make a remote site behave differently than it intended to ]
[15:13:49] <KingDosser> hahah danheberden: Did you make it?
[15:14:32] <michaeln_> i have a textarea, when ppl save , i get the content by .val(), and append it somewhere on the page. The problem is I can not render the line breaks if ppl enter blank lines. Content is in a long line.
[15:14:33] <danheberden> nup - zalun did
[15:14:38] <danheberden> if it's being slow, check out jsbin.com
[15:15:57] <michaeln_> so i google, and it is known by jquery that .val() will strips carriage and they suggest to use $.valHooks.textarea as a workaround. But I dont understand the valHooks works.
[15:16:00] <sqider> michaeln_ where is that text saved and how do you fetch it?
[15:16:30] <paul____> danheberden: ProLoser|Work: http://jsfiddle.net/qBubN/2/
[15:16:31] <Jayflux> anyone know why my dropdown isnt returning a value to the console http://goo.gl/M4rdp
[15:16:34] <coldhead> KingDosser: you got a server or something?
[15:16:35] <paul____> i think it;s the position: absolute
[15:16:37] <Jayflux> or why its returning an empty one?
[15:16:59] <coldhead> KingDosser: failing that. try adding debugger; inside your newItems function and step through it to see what is happening
[15:17:14] <michaeln_> i code a quick example to demonstrate
[15:17:22] <danheberden> michaeln_ you could do $.valHooks.textarea = { get: function(){ return this.value; } }; or something
[15:17:52] <ravenzz> buh
[15:18:17] <Jayflux> ignore that
[15:19:18] <ravenzz> michael_ http://jsfiddle.net/wErRn/
[15:20:51] <sqider> michaeln_, where do you safe your text to? might be a fetch problem

[15:54:59] <dabear> jaequery: who are you? You most certainly are mixing me up with someone else

[15:59:00] <Heshanh> does toggleClass add to the list of classes in the element or replace all with the enw one

[16:05:00] <last1> when calling $("myform").html()  does that also output the values assigned to the form through jquery ?

[16:17:35] <AzizLight> Hi everybody
[16:17:37] <ProLoser|Work> does anyone use html5form?
[16:17:49] <danheberden> only html4form
[16:18:11] <ProLoser|Work> http://code.google.com/p/html5form/
[16:18:13] <AzizLight> is there a way to disable the history dropdown that appears under text input fields using jquery?
[16:18:24] <clutchski> Hey all, i'm curious if anyone has built any offline jquery mobile apps with dynamic pages. Ideally, I'd like to use Backbone's hash routing, and handle page templating, creation, transtions from within there. Has anyone used the a similar strategy?
[16:19:13] <danheberden> AzizLight add autocomplete="off" to the input
[16:20:05] <AzizLight> danheberden: is that just plain html or a jquery thing? how well supported is that in browsers?
[16:20:20] <paul____> does anyone know how to get draggable to work with position: absolute + scale transform? i need to use it for my particular application and tried alternatives like position:relative + float: leftâ€¦ i wish i could fix this http://jsfiddle.net/qBubN/2/
[16:20:36] <KingDosser> http://bit.ly/u1FV4D - I am having trouble getting newItem to work.
[16:20:44] <KingDosser> Any help would be greatly appreciated.
[16:20:55] <danheberden> AzizLight html thing http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533486(v=vs.85).aspx  https://developer.mozilla.org/en/How_to_Turn_Off_Form_Autocompletion
[16:21:07] <ajpiano> clutchski: i've used backbone a lot
[16:21:07] <ajpiano> not for that specifically
[16:21:07] <ajpiano> but it seems up to the task :)
[16:21:39] <ajpiano> KingDosser: are you talking about line 92
[16:21:40] <ajpiano> where you don't call the function
[16:21:41] <ajpiano> but instead just be like
[16:21:44] <ajpiano> newItem;
[16:21:56] <clutchski> ajpiano: yeah, i've used backbone quite as well, i'm just sure about the jquery mobile piece. I've been hacking a bit, but no breakthrough yet.
[16:22:00] <AzizLight> danheberden: thanks a lot
[16:22:13] <KingDosser> ajpiano: One sec, let me update the link.
[16:22:40] <KingDosser> Again, I failed and that is an old link. One moment please :)
[16:22:55] <paul____> danheberden: ProLoser|Work : oops! i gave you guys the wrong revision last time. it didn't show the error but this does!! http://jsfiddle.net/qBubN/7/
[16:23:41] <KingDosser> ajpiano: There you go. Updated. I think it might be a problem with the function calling itself?
[16:23:49] <danheberden> sry paul____ what's the problem?
[16:23:52] <danheberden> i wasn't paying attention
[16:24:58] <paul____> danheberden: basically the deal is that i need to use pos: abs for my app with a css scale transform on it, but jquery ui draggable seems to use the wrong start position as if the element was not scaled. so on drag begin it jumps
[16:27:17] <KingDosser> ajpiano: If i change it back to setTimeout, it says that newItem is undefined?
[16:28:20] <danheberden> yeah, you'll have to compensate for that unfortunately
[16:28:22] <danheberden> paul____ http://jsfiddle.net/danheberden/LJ8a4/
[16:29:26] <paul____> darn, i see. thanks!
[16:30:17] <paul____> danheberden: this might be what i need https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/-moz-transform-origin
[16:30:40] <KingDosser> Yes!!! I fixed it!
[16:30:41] <danheberden> yeah that might fix the visual problem
[16:31:20] <paul____> brilliant! it works
[16:31:22] <paul____> thanks danheberden
[16:35:19] <Whirl3d> .seen devc
[16:35:19] <hsbot> devc was seen 11 minutes and 23 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Quit: devc
[16:41:41] <last1> is .html() buggy ? I have this example: http://jsfiddle.net/eguTE/
[16:41:47] <last1> the hidden input gets updated but not the text
[16:43:09] <Whirl3d> last1, it works for me.
[16:43:14] <KingDosser> If I have a custom plugin method, how do I make it so that I can instantiate multiple versions of it and the configs will not overwrite eachother
[16:44:42] <last1> Whirl3d: what do you mean ?
[16:44:51] <last1> what does the console log show you ?
[16:45:10] <Whirl3d> last1, I get the exact text (html) in the div you listed in the console
[16:45:28] <last1> which is what ?
[16:45:40] <danheberden> last1 there's a difference between the value property and the value attribute
[16:45:41] <Whirl3d> two input statements
[16:45:47] <danheberden> http://jsfiddle.net/danheberden/eguTE/1/
[16:45:57] <last1> Whirl3d: that's normal, but look at the values
[16:47:00] <last1> danheberden: I don't understand. isn't .val('World') changing the value of the input element ?
[16:47:23] <danheberden> it's changing the value of the element - the property of that dom node
[16:47:45] <danheberden> but the html possibly derived form outerHTML? nup
[16:47:57] <last1> but why does the hidden one update ?
[16:48:52] <CodeZombie> damn, still can't figure this out... can someone take a look at this https://gist.github.com/bf23e790335b789a1f41. What happens is, if I set the content elements height while resizing, the value of h increments, instead of resets.
[16:48:57] <danheberden> i think that might be a browser bug/issues last1
[16:49:04] <danheberden> i mean - it makes sense that outerHTML would change
[16:49:07] <danheberden> i'm just saying it's not in your case
[16:49:10] <CodeZombie> which, causes my content elements height to be set to ridiculously high numbers
[16:49:10] <danheberden> workaround: http://jsfiddle.net/danheberden/eguTE/2/
[16:49:10] <RedOrigin> Is there a way to get jquery to resize a layout with an aspect ratio of 16:9? So that the whole page will be seen even when the browser size changes.
[16:49:48] <last1> danheberden: I've tried it in 3 different browsers
[16:49:53] <last1> all have the same behavior
[16:50:05] <last1> hidden input updates fine but not text/select/radio
[16:50:27] <danheberden> that's definitely an interesting discrepancy
[16:51:04] <danheberden> last1 but it's not a jq issue: http://jsfiddle.net/danheberden/eguTE/4/
[16:51:18] <mats_> anyone know how i can see how many kb/mb my start page is? /randomquestion
[16:52:09] <last1> not sure why I keep on getting: There are no child objects
[16:52:53] <last1> even your last example still prints 'hello'
[16:53:06] <idefine> if referencing an element by the class name do you always have to do .eq(0) to get the first element?
[16:53:10] <danheberden> last1 exactly
[16:53:33] <last1> but this works: http://jsfiddle.net/eguTE/6/
[16:53:47] <danheberden> correct - because you're changing the attr
[16:53:49] <danheberden> instead of the prop
[16:54:13] <last1> sorry if I'm dumb, can you show me a documet that explains the difference ?
[16:54:16] <last1> document
[16:54:34] <last1> I keep on thinking 'value' is unique
[16:55:03] <last1> how is $("#test1").val() different from $("test1").attr('value')
[16:55:30] <danheberden> ?prop @ last1
[16:55:30] <bot-t> last1, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[16:55:51] <danheberden> val is similar to prop, but handles some edge cases
[16:56:09] <last1> so in <input type=text value='hello'>  'value' is a property right ?
[16:57:18] <danheberden> in that case, it's an attribute
[16:57:34] <Whirl3d> I don't get it. I copied the html() from the form and appended it to the body to see if it would have the correct value and it doesnt: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/FS2CY/9/
[16:58:22] <last1> Whirl3d: exactly my point
[16:58:35] <last1> but if you do it with .attr('value', 'world') then it works
[16:58:54] <Whirl3d> that's because html() copies the attributes, but not the properties?
[16:59:19] <last1> I'm not sure, that's why I came here
[16:59:25] <danheberden> Whirl3d the key here is it uses outerHTML if available - and the browser is only updating the outerHTML when you change the property, not the value
[16:59:51] <danheberden> e.g. if you did element.disabled = "true" i doubt you'd get disabled="true" in your .html()
[16:59:53] <last1> jeezus, I'm confused: value='hello'  which is the property, the attribute and the value ?
[17:00:57] <danheberden> http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2011/06/html-difference-between-attribute-and.html
[17:01:19] <danheberden> there are two independant things - the markup that creates the dom node, and the actual dom-node
[17:01:32] <danheberden> one is just markup to represent the node - to create it.. one is the actual thing in the browser
[17:01:46] <last1> ok, I get that
[17:01:55] <last1> but it still doesn't explain why it works on hidden inputs
[17:01:58] <danheberden> so you're having problems going back and forth between those two things, which can be fraught with difficulties
[17:02:04] <danheberden> last1 just a browser issue
[17:02:10] <last1> on all of them ?
[17:02:17] <danheberden> theoretically, any change to value _should_ affect the elements outerHTML
[17:02:22] <danheberden> last1 donno - didn't check
[17:02:25] <danheberden> just looked at chrome
[17:02:27] <last1> i tried ff, chrome & ie9
[17:02:31] <danheberden> if it's just chrome, check out crbug.com
[17:03:00] <danheberden> ok - so if they all exibit it - maybe there's some crazy-ass reason? either way - you can work around it with attr if you need a solution today
[17:03:26] <last1> yes, changing the code now
[17:03:50] <last1> I'm just starting off with jQuery. just my luck to waste a day finding out a bug :P
[17:05:36] <oracl> test
[17:07:10] <coldhead> hey mulsey
[17:12:50] <last1> dan: do you know a bit about fancybox ?
[17:23:21] <JakeSays> hey any raphael/paper.js users in here?
[17:24:23] <vmasto> hey guys, quick question: anyone knows why in jQuery UI Tabs, when clicking on a tab it does not append the hash at the end of the url?
[17:24:23] <danieliser> have a .click even to load a modal window on an <li>. The list-item contains a link. Link is firing as well as the li so i need to remove the click event from the link.. how can i do this?
[17:25:34] <vmasto> for example: in the official tabs demo http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/default.html it doesn't either
[17:29:52] <vmasto> anyone? :(
[17:31:56] <coldhead> vmasto: it must be calling preventDefault
[17:32:04] <coldhead> ?preventdefault @ vmasto
[17:32:05] <bot-t> vmasto, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[17:32:13] <vmasto> how to bypass that though?
[17:33:17] <danieliser> how can i click a parent and prevent the child click event from happening? preventdefault goes up the bubble not down.
[17:33:23] <vmasto> over at Ben Almans examples (http://is.gd/IrpMMS) it works great
[17:33:52] <coldhead> vmasto: you probably need to fake it: $('a.tab').click(function () {location.hash = $(this).attr('href')}) or something
[17:34:04] <vmasto> hmm let me try that
[17:34:34] <coldhead> danieliser: same kinda thing for you: $('li a').click(function (e) {e.preventDefault();})
[17:34:42] <coldhead> that should stop the link being followed
[17:38:13] <danieliser> coldhead: can that be called from inside the li.click event?
[17:38:22] <danieliser> or does it need to be declared before?
[17:44:59] <CodeZombie> can someone take a look at this fiddle, and tell me why the value of $('#content').height() is incrementing
[17:45:01] <CodeZombie> http://jsfiddle.net/zNR2L/
[17:46:01] <CodeZombie> the value shouldn't increment, it should reset... If you comment out the line that changes the height, the values are normal
[17:46:05] <CodeZombie> they don't increment
[17:47:37] <coldhead> danieliser: it probably needs to be called first
[17:47:45] <coldhead> inside the li it will be too late
[17:48:16] <danieliser> i ened up just adding detection in my script before adding the click event. if(!$this.is('a')) $this = $this.children('a').eq(0)	
[17:48:47] <danieliser> its used in my emodal plugin..
[17:48:58] <coldhead> hey good job
[17:49:18] <danieliser> ??
[17:50:11] <danieliser> iis there a more effective way? or is that a clean way to do it?
[17:51:50] <coldhead> don't use <a>s :)
[17:52:19] <coldhead> having links behave in this custom way is necessarily unclean
[17:52:24] <coldhead> it can't really be helped
[17:56:47] <coldhead> YES i just used $.map()
[17:56:50] <coldhead> i feel so alive
[17:57:05] <coldhead> oh god, here comes the crushing low
[17:59:01] <Guest5018> say i have 5 datetime values, how might i get the closest one in a railsy way?
[17:59:07] <Guest5018> oops wrong channel!
[17:59:41] <warrenparsons> coldhead: Alcohol or getting out more, maybe both.
[18:06:16] <vmasto> darn it's not working, I'm going insane
[18:06:46] <vmasto> guys, anyone knows why the jQuery UI Tabs doesn't update the hash on tab click and how to make it so that it does?
[18:08:55] <coldhead> vmasto: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/570276/changing-location-hash-with-jquery-ui-tabs
[18:09:36] <vmasto> coldhead: thanks, but this method isn't compatible with BBQ plugin :(
[18:09:59] <vmasto> coldhead: I'm trying to implement back button functionality but this is a major blocker
[18:11:01] <coldhead> well you could ask ben_alman_ for help but he's partying for his birthday today
[18:11:30] <coldhead> did you try this: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/fragment-jquery-ui-tabs/
[18:11:41] <coldhead> that's got all the magic keywords in it :P
[18:13:35] <vmasto> coldhead: yes, but his version of jQuery UI Tabs appends hashchange
[18:13:45] <vmasto> coldhead: something must be different in the jQuery UI he uses
[18:14:12] <coldhead> vmasto: ben_alman_ is the best person to ask, if you can wait
[18:14:36] <vmasto> I know, I don't want to bother him :(
[18:14:43] <coldhead> bother him!
[18:14:47] <coldhead> he loves it
[18:15:10] <coldhead> ben_alman_: if you don't mind people bothering you, please make no reply
[18:15:13] <coldhead> you see?
[18:15:16] <coldhead> no problemo
[18:15:25] <vmasto> hahah
[18:18:49] <vmasto> for some reason, jQuery UI Tabs seams to "eat up" custom events, for example, if I change their initializing event from "click" to something else (e.g. 'change') and then try to dosomething with  ("#tab ul li a").click() method does nothing!
[18:18:55] <vmasto> unbelievable!
[18:20:10] <coldhead> ajpiano: are you around to solve all the UI tabs problems of the world?
[18:20:19] <coldhead> in return, nudes
[18:23:51] <coldhead> i'm sorry vmasto
[18:24:06] <coldhead> this is literally the worst support channel in history
[18:24:15] <vmasto> coldhead: no worries mate, i'm grateful
[18:24:30] <vmasto> ah come on #jquery is awesome :) community here helped me many times
[18:24:42] <vmasto> probs everyone's sleeping :d
[18:25:20] <GarethTheGreat> Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined < getting this in google chrome's console, any tips?
[18:25:56] <coldhead> you are not including jQuery, GarethTheGreat?
[18:26:02] <coldhead> or including it wrong
[18:26:15] <coldhead> or calling noConflict()
[18:26:23] <vmasto> GarethTheGreat: you are probably including jquery AFTER your custom script
[18:26:30] <vmasto> or what coldhead said
[18:26:30] <coldhead> can you access jQuery for which $ is an alias?
[18:26:36] <GarethTheGreat> i'm including jquery in the header
[18:26:45] <GarethTheGreat> then my script is later down the page
[18:26:54] <GarethTheGreat> $('#updatequote').change(function() { GetQuote();
[18:26:54] <GarethTheGreat> }).change();
[18:26:57] <GarethTheGreat> that's my code
[18:27:08] <GarethTheGreat> i'm using jQuery 1.5
[18:27:43] <vmasto> then maybe its a conflict problem as coldhead says, are you using other javascript libraries on your page ?
[18:27:45] <coldhead> GarethTheGreat: check with firebug or chrome inspector that the file is actually being loaded
[18:27:55] <coldhead> it may be a 404 or somesuch
[18:28:18] <GarethTheGreat> i've got a json lib
[18:28:23] <GarethTheGreat> i'll try removing that
[18:28:26] <el_gordito> test 123
[18:28:29] <GarethTheGreat> it's not a 404 - i can load the URL manually
[18:30:25] <Sora_> hiya ppl ^^;
[18:31:05] <iateadonut> if $(this) is a div.class1, how do i find the eq() value of $(this) in reference to it's class?
[18:31:39] <iateadonut> ie, how do you alert, for example, which of many div's of "class1" the div that you have selected is?
[18:31:54] <coldhead> iateadonut: if the other elements are siblings you can use ?index
[18:31:54] <bot-t> iateadonut, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[18:32:28] <Sora_> .lenght no ?
[18:33:36] <Sora_> th*
[18:36:00] <coldhead> Sora_: length will tell you the total number of elements
[18:36:17] <coldhead> although maybe $('.someclass').indexOf(this)
[18:36:26] <coldhead> yeah that would TOTALLY work
[18:36:29] <coldhead> >: |
[18:36:36] <Sora_> oh but...which of many div's of "class1" the div that you have selected is?
[18:36:46] <coldhead> i believe that is the question
[18:36:46] <GolF> Hi

[18:50:44] <GarethTheGreat> i'd rather not give the URL in a public channel as it's on my dev server
[18:50:50] <GarethTheGreat> so if anyone would be willing to help it'd be most appreciated
[18:50:53] <scorphus> dr0id: yo

[19:09:24] <Sora_> lol
[19:13:23] <iateadonut> coldhead, bot-t, thanks.
[19:13:34] <coldhead> good job bot-t
[19:13:37] <coldhead> ?botsnack
[19:13:38] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[19:14:15] <Dave_Stein> for a second i thought the bot was actually talking and then i saw the botsnack thing
[19:16:42] <iateadonut> is there a way to suspend some parts of jquery that you don't want to run in ie7?
[19:16:48] <iateadonut> (to easily do it)
[19:17:00] <Dave_Stein> why would you ever need to do that
[19:17:57] <ub3rst4r> I have a dynamic content website and it uses $.getScript() to reload a jquery script everytime the content changes. It was working perfectly up until a couple days ago and now it will load the script when the page is first loaded but wont work when the content changes. Any ideas?
[19:18:10] <iateadonut> because ie7 does not render the animation correctly.
[19:18:44] <Dave_Stein> sounds like you need to fix the markup some
[19:18:47] <Dave_Stein> make a jsfiddle of it
[19:18:49] <coldhead> Dave_Stein: sometimes he talks
[19:18:52] <coldhead> it's a beautiful wonder
[19:18:54] <Dave_Stein> coldhead: lies
[19:18:58] <coldhead> no really!
[19:19:06] <ub3rst4r> i am using firefox 8 on windows 7 (x64) and i tested it on chrome as well
[19:19:15] <Dave_Stein> ub3rst4r: how do you detect the content changing?
[19:20:26] <ub3rst4r> Dave_Stein well it calls $('#content').load(url, function() { <content changed> });
[19:20:44] <Dave_Stein> so inside your load you run $.getScript right after?
[19:20:58] <ub3rst4r> err $('#content').load(url, function() { $.getScript() } );
[19:21:09] <ub3rst4r> Dave_Stein yes
[19:21:10] <Dave_Stein> did you make sure the returned JS is still valid?
[19:21:40] <Dave_Stein> like was it working the whole time with zero code changes? until FF8 came out?
[19:21:54] <ub3rst4r> Dave_Stein well i havent changed anything and i checked firebug and theres no errors
[19:22:22] <Dave_Stein> look in firebug, take the response out and paste it into jslint or another parser
[19:22:30] <Dave_Stein> sometimes firebug doesn't like to repotr things depending on settings
[19:22:52] <ub3rst4r> Dave_Stein I dont think its ff8 cause it doesnt work on chrome either
[19:23:56] <ub3rst4r> Dave_Stein and it will show in firebug that its getting the script
[19:24:10] <Dave_Stein> ya but did you actually make sure the script is solid in a parser
[19:25:28] <ub3rst4r> Dave_Stein how do i set it so it knows its jquery in jslint?
[19:25:54] <Dave_Stein> well i mean jquery didnt magically break from one day to the next
[19:25:59] <Dave_Stein> unless you changed its version or something
[19:26:22] <Dave_Stein> so im saying the script that comes back in firebug from getscript
[19:26:31] <Dave_Stein> you shouold copy paste it out and see theres no errors there
[19:26:44] <Dave_Stein> are you using getscript cause its dynamic content inside the script?
[19:27:53] <ub3rst4r> Dave_Stein no cause it needs to reload the script for the plugins to work
[19:29:17] <Dave_Stein> well without seeing the code i cant be of much help
[19:29:32] <Dave_Stein> sounds like you cant fiddle it easily
[19:29:38] <Dave_Stein> but you should still check that the getscript response is still valid
[19:31:16] <ub3rst4r> Dave_Stein i figured it out. it looks like its got something to do with v1.7
[19:31:36] <Dave_Stein> " $.getScript() to reload a jquery script everytime the content changes. It was working perfectly up until a couple days ago and now it will load the script when the page is first loaded but wont work when the content changes"
[19:31:40] <Dave_Stein> you never said you upgraded
[19:31:43] <Dave_Stein> even after i said
[19:31:50] <Dave_Stein> well i mean jquery didnt magically break from one day to the next  unless you changed its version or something
[19:31:51] <Dave_Stein> 0.o
[19:32:26] <ub3rst4r> Dave_Stein I use the http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js url and I wasnt sure if it was upgraded or not
[19:32:51] <Dave_Stein> 1.7 recently came out
[19:32:56] <Dave_Stein> you shouldnt use that on a production site
[19:34:19] <ub3rst4r> Dave_Stein I guess I will be sticking with v1.6.4 for now until I can figure out how to make it work with v1.7
[19:44:09] <VarunBatra> Hi, I am trying to call a function after adding javascript. I am currently using this: http://jsfiddle.net/KzuVe/ Since javascript is external, I can't use ajax getScript. I will appreciate a suggestion
[19:45:19] <Dave_Stein> you can add the JS tag with the src you want and then wait for the readyState to be "complete" I believe
[19:45:22] <iateadonut> i have some animations that are run on a mouseenter.  if i run back and forth through them (mouseenter, mouseout) a bunch of times real quick, it totally screws up, even though i call $(':animated')stop... first line in each mouseenter/mouseleave... what should i do instead?
[19:46:05] <Dave_Stein> iateadonut: that happens to me somtimes. it's not just stop to fix it... im trying to remember. it has something to do with the queue
[19:46:30] <VarunBatra> Dave_Stein, can you be more specific? Few editing of codes will be appreciated, I have also tried c.load = function(){ alert('asdf'); }; but didn't work either
[19:46:37] <Dave_Stein> ah yeah there it is
[19:46:45] <Dave_Stein> iateadonut: $('#el').stop( true );
[19:46:59] <Dave_Stein> it will nuke the queue
[19:47:10] <iateadonut> #el?
[19:47:12] <Dave_Stein> cause stop will only work on the currently running one
[19:47:21] <Dave_Stein> whatever the el is that youre animating
[19:47:22] <Dave_Stein> :)
[19:47:23] <VarunBatra> element >
[19:47:31] <iateadonut> thanks.
[19:47:32] <VarunBatra> May be you can simply unbind event
[19:47:53] <Dave_Stein> VarunBatra: c.onload is the function if it were native but i cant remember if that works totally
[19:49:05] <VarunBatra> But nothing seems to work, I wanted to load addthis and then show toolbar here: http://www.varunbatra.com/ but can't figure out how? Ideally onload should work. My problem is to load script and AFTER loading is done call a function
[19:49:38] <VarunBatra> I don't mind if it shoot on domready and not addthis ready, but somehting I need to show add this toolbar ONLY after complete rendering
[19:51:04] <Dave_Stein> http://jsfiddle.net/KzuVe/1/
[19:51:37] <VarunBatra> Damn it wasn't working on my site, let me check again :(
[19:53:13] <VarunBatra> This document.getElementsByTagName( 'head' )[0].appendChild( c );     and $("head").append(c); are same, aint they append put in last excpet that :)
[19:53:45] <Dave_Stein> yeah im not sure why $('head').append(c) wasnt working for me
[19:53:48] <Dave_Stein> coulda been fiddle stuffs
[19:54:02] <VarunBatra> Ok
[19:56:24] <Dave_Stein> im wondering if onload is firing too fast or not
[19:57:19] <VarunBatra> I think it doesn't even load addthis before it fires, but checking more
[19:57:54] <Dave_Stein> im trying onreadystatechange but i dont know why its not working
[19:57:56] <vmasto> quick question: I'm running this code: $("elem").load(blah.html, tabsInit() ); although it works and tabsInit() runs, firebug console spews an error that "tabsInit is not a function", what am I doing wrong?
[19:58:00] <Dave_Stein> i mus be missing something
[19:58:04] <Dave_Stein> VarunBatra: check out labjs
[19:58:28] <Dave_Stein> your callback should be tabsInit
[19:58:33] <Dave_Stein> the fact that you put () means it runs that instance
[19:58:51] <vmasto> if I put just tabsInit then it doesn't get called :(
[19:59:10] <vmasto> btw tabsInit is a self-evoking function, does that have to do anything with it?
[19:59:27] <VarunBatra> Now what is labjs?
[19:59:32] <Dave_Stein> sure sounds it
[19:59:45] <Dave_Stein> if its a callback why is it running itself
[19:59:50] <Dave_Stein> like you wrappted it with ( ) () ?
[19:59:55] <vmasto> yes
[19:59:58] <Dave_Stein> Varun: it's a dynamic script loader :)
[20:00:04] <vmasto> Because I also need it to run at page load
[20:00:09] <vmasto> or document ready
[20:00:36] <Dave_Stein> youre prob better off doing $(document).ready( function() { tabsInit(); });
[20:01:05] <VarunBatra> Sounds good I will try to find it out
[20:01:14] <vmasto> should I do that or $.load(blah.html, function() { tabsInit(); }); ?
[20:01:32] <last1> I know a tr by id, how can I get that tr's second td text value ?
[20:01:42] <Dave_Stein> no
[20:01:45] <Dave_Stein> it shold be , tabsInit
[20:01:48] <last1> I tried: $("#mytr").find("td:eq(1)").text()
[20:01:49] <Dave_Stein> can you make a fiddle?
[20:02:12] <VarunBatra> Ok now it is working :) :) :) :) http://www.varunbatra.com/ :) :) :) :)
[20:02:16] <vmasto> hm it loads Ajax stuff so it shouldn't work in jsfiddle
[20:02:17] <VarunBatra> Thanks Dav
[20:02:24] <VarunBatra> *Dave
[20:02:32] <Dave_Stein> vmasto: look one sec
[20:02:55] <vmasto> I just don't get why a self evoking named function can't be used as a callback function? :(
[20:02:57] <Dave_Stein> vmasto: http://jsfiddle.net/ZdZzk/
[20:03:04] <Dave_Stein> see how x isnt availble cause it ran
[20:03:07] <Dave_Stein> but y is
[20:03:34] <VarunBatra> Try chaining them..

[20:04:05] <vmasto> why oh why?
[20:04:18] <iateadonut> is there a good tutorial about watching your jquery funtion run through firebug?
[20:04:28] <Dave_Stein> hitting the profile button :)
[20:04:37] <VarunBatra> I might be in middle so don't know whole stuff but it is working.
[20:04:44] <Dave_Stein> last1 that looks like it should work
[20:04:55] <VarunBatra> Which mine ?
[20:05:15] <Dave_Stein> last1: http://jsfiddle.net/NrhKN/
[20:05:29] <Dave_Stein> VarunBatra: you broke it even more :)
[20:05:42] <Dave_Stein> vmasto: im not sure why offhand, but its self invoking so im sure its special
[20:05:46] <VarunBatra> As I said, I don't know what you wanted :)
[20:05:56] <Dave_Stein> like i said, just do document.ready to run tabsinit
[20:06:02] <Dave_Stein> and then your callback should just be , tabsinit
[20:06:03] <Dave_Stein> then you win
[20:07:09] <vmasto> hmm
[20:07:12] <vmasto> everything is in document.ready tho
[20:07:51] <vmasto> what a peculiar problem omg
[20:08:18] <Dave_Stein> vmasto: http://jsfiddle.net/ZdZzk/2/
[20:08:19] <vmasto> What I'm trying to do is simple: Have a function run on load, and also have it run as a callback, this should be just easy to do.
[20:08:21] <Dave_Stein> youre just coding funy
[20:08:23] <warrenparsons> Don't put everything in document.ready, please.
[20:08:29] * warrenparsons is a little drunk.
[20:08:35] <Dave_Stein> warrenparsons: is also right even tho drunk
[20:08:44] <Dave_Stein> the last link is what youre aiming for
[20:09:21] <vmasto> Dave_Stein: it doesn't work :(
[20:09:27] <warrenparsons> Remember, somebody other than you will one day have to maintain your code. Be kind to that future person.
[20:09:30] <Dave_Stein> http://jsfiddle.net/ZdZzk/3/ this one is a bit better
[20:09:30] <vmasto> it seems as if the function is still unavailable!
[20:09:56] <Dave_Stein> why dont you patse your code into fiddle cuase you def screwed something up that isnt too hard to debug :)
[20:10:07] <vmasto> ok give me a sec
[20:10:09] <vmasto> it won't work though
[20:10:20] <Dave_Stein> yeah i know it wont but it'll be good to see the code
[20:10:26] <Dave_Stein> youre probably using module for no reason :)
[20:11:11] <last1> would this be a valid way of constructing an id name ? : $("#u"+$("#edit1").val()+"B"+$("#edit2").val())
[20:11:27] <last1> basically I'm trying to make up the name #uVar1BVar2
[20:11:42] <Dave_Stein> uhhhh yeah that would "work" but that probably isn't the best way to do what youre trying to do
[20:11:44] <Dave_Stein> what are you tryin to do
[20:11:50] <warrenparsons> Gah!
[20:11:56] <last1> reference an id in my document
[20:12:00] <last1> starting from two variables I have
[20:12:06] <Dave_Stein> why would it have to do with the two variables
[20:12:08] <Dave_Stein> backtrack more :)
[20:12:20] <last1> the element is a <tr>
[20:12:26] <last1> each tr has a unique id
[20:12:38] <last1> I want to get to a specific one
[20:12:44] <Dave_Stein> what's the ID made from?
[20:12:47] <Dave_Stein> two different parameters?
[20:12:51] <last1> yes
[20:12:57] <Sora_> if boucle ??
[20:13:05] <Sora_> is*
[20:13:12] <Sora_> sry fucking vodka u.u
[20:13:35] <Dave_Stein> <div param1="a" param2="b"></div> $('[param1=a][param2=b]')
[20:13:35] <vmasto> Dave_Stein: http://jsfiddle.net/Pt3Mk/
[20:13:37] <vmasto> that's my whole code
[20:13:42] <warrenparsons> Sora_: Vodka here too. Mixed with sprite. Shit...
[20:13:47] <last1> when I do a console.log() on that concoction it does print the right name
[20:13:51] <Dave_Stein> weird youre doing it by two params at once tho... never had to do that before
[20:13:54] <vmasto> and when the php file gets loaded, it just doesn't initialize the tabs
[20:14:06] <last1> but it doesn't access the right element
[20:14:12] <Sora_> warrenparsons: with tonic here!
[20:14:15] <vmasto> but if I do $.load(blah.php, tabsInit() ); it does!
[20:14:31] <last1> in other words: $("#u"+$("#edit1").val()+"B"+$("#edit2").val())  prints the right id
[20:14:41] <warrenparsons> Sora_: also maraschino cherries. Shirley Temple, or Shirley McClaine as the GF dubbed it.
[20:14:48] <last1> but I can't access that element
[20:15:11] <Dave_Stein> vmasto: add "var"
[20:15:19] <Dave_Stein> http://jsfiddle.net/Pt3Mk/1/
[20:15:27] <warrenparsons> Corrupting a perfectly innocent drink with Smirnoff. That's just how we roll.
[20:15:34] <Sora_> warrenparsons: xD well im drink abs raps with tonic only...
[20:16:15] <warrenparsons> Sora_: Vodka and tonic seems a waste. No flavor. You need some gin up in dere.
[20:16:25] <Dave_Stein> i gotta get away from the pc for now tho
[20:16:30] <Dave_Stein> back is startin to kill for no reason
[20:16:32] <Dave_Stein> gl
[20:16:37] <warrenparsons> Dave_Stein: sorry to hear that.
[20:16:55] <Dave_Stein> its been a rough week to say the least heh
[20:16:56] <Dave_Stein> ttyl man
[20:17:19] <vmasto> still doesnt work, im going crazy
[20:17:25] <Sora_> warrenparsons: im fan of martini's of vodka... but im in house and i need a drink ^^;
[20:17:53] <warrenparsons> Sora_: I'm still lukewarm on martinis. I feel like I should like them for a mature drink, but they're still kinda bland.
[20:19:14] <warrenparsons> Sora_: and jeez, gin is better than vodka in so many ways. Vodka is only useful if you don't want it affecting the flavor of other ingredients.
[20:19:53] <coldhead> gin is for girls and makes you cry
[20:19:59] <coldhead> cry and cheat on your husband and cry
[20:20:02] <Sora_> warrenparsons: yeaah.. it the fucking point!!
[20:20:10] <coldhead> or so i am told anyway
[20:20:13] <warrenparsons> coldhead: Gin is for tonic and martinis. Juniper FTW.
[20:20:24] <coldhead> juniper is pure girl
[20:20:30] <warrenparsons> Bah.
[20:20:32] <Sora_> wait wait
[20:20:34] <coldhead> who drinks gin? the british
[20:20:38] <coldhead> and all british are girls
[20:20:41] <Sora_> wtf is juniper ??!?!
[20:20:48] <coldhead> ?w juniper
[20:20:49] <bot-t> coldhead, Juniper - Junipers are coniferous plants in the genus Juniperus () of the cypress family Cupressaceae. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juniper
[20:20:49] <warrenparsons> Sora_: the main flavor component of gin.
[20:20:57] <Sora_> LOL
[20:21:15] <Sora_> 1 sec google
[20:21:24] <warrenparsons> Gin and tonic, with a twist of lemon (not lime, though acceptable. Good stuff.
[20:21:45] <last1> in this example: http://jsfiddle.net/5ApSa/5/
[20:21:55] <last1> why does it not access the right tr, despite having constructed the proper name ?
[20:22:01] <warrenparsons> Gin should be Gordon's or Tangueray.
[20:22:25] <warrenparsons> Bombay is a waste in cocktails.
[20:22:44] <Sora_> ohh
[20:23:27] <warrenparsons> I still need to try a White Russian, dude style - with non-dairy creamer in place of milk. Need to build courage for that one.
[20:23:27] <Sora_> i dont know wtf is juniper

[20:23:40] <coldhead> it's a berry, Sora_

[20:25:06] <bot-t> coldhead, I'm a bot you know..
[20:25:28] <warrenparsons> VarunBatra: Really? I've not run into that.

[20:25:54] <VarunBatra> Yes and warrenparsons, I am really annoyed, my visitors can like me but I don't believe they will like their app :)
[20:25:58] <coldhead> what hath i wrought
[20:26:02] <warrenparsons> VarunBatra: Lame.
[20:26:26] <Sora_> warrenparsons: my favorite martini is the ginger pear
[20:26:41] <warrenparsons> We have to use AddThis on like everything lately, social media du jour.
[20:27:06] <VarunBatra> I needed analytics as well and no config, it is just override, there must be a way though I will try to figure out when may be unbind their function add mine :)
[20:27:11] <warrenparsons> Sora_: I'm still on the basic martini. Training wheels, so to speak.
[20:27:33] <Sora_> ok ok
[20:27:51] <Sora_> with goose is really good ^^;
[20:27:59] <warrenparsons> I don't like olives either, makes it tough.
[20:28:05] <warrenparsons> I imagine.
[20:28:25] <Sora_> no no
[20:28:26] <coldhead> i think cocktails that aren't on fire are unmanly
[20:28:33] <Sora_> vodka martini dont have olives
[20:28:39] <coldhead> if you're serious about drinking something, it should be aflame
[20:28:42] <coldhead> like our hearts
[20:28:44] <warrenparsons> And martini glasses are made for spilling if you've already had a few drinks. Bastards.
[20:29:04] <Sora_> slow plz my english sux
[20:29:05] <Sora_> hahaha
[20:29:23] <warrenparsons> Sora_: It's cool. I'm not saying much that's important tonight.
[20:29:32] <Sora_> xD
[20:29:37] <Sora_> is important!
[20:29:38] <Sora_> xD
[20:30:24] <Sora_> the martinis glases are for drink fast.. not have ice
[20:31:39] <warrenparsons> What's the point of mixing a cocktail if you're going to drink it fast?
[20:31:49] <Sora_> noo
[20:31:55] <Sora_> uhm
[20:32:40] <Sora_> not ia a drink for an hour
[20:33:01] <Sora_> is*
[20:33:16] <warrenparsons> Ahh
[20:36:36] <vmasto> Is there anyone that could tell me why in this: http://jsfiddle.net/Pt3Mk/1/ the tabs don't get initialized after being loaded into the page?
[20:37:48] <zkirill> Does if ( a | b ) evaluate a first and if it is false then b does not get evaluated
[20:38:22] <warrenparsons> zkirill: If a is false, b will get evaluated.
[20:38:32] <warrenparsons> And it should be if (a || b)
[20:38:49] <Sora_> warrenparsons: salud!
[20:39:32] <last1> what am I doing wrong in building this dynamic selector ? : http://jsfiddle.net/5ApSa/17/
[20:39:37] <warrenparsons> Sora_: salud!
[20:39:50] <zkirill> warrenparsons: thanks, so if the first one is true then the second one doesn't get evaluated?
[20:39:59] <warrenparsons> zkirill: That's right.
[20:40:08] <zkirill> warrenparsons: much obliged sir
[20:40:43] <vmasto> days like this i just hate javascript & myself
[20:41:07] <warrenparsons> last1: Is bb1 an attribute selector?
[20:41:45] <warrenparsons> last1: @ for attribute selectors has been deprecated for some time. It may not even be present in 1.7.
[20:41:46] <last1> warren: it gets the value from the html code above
[20:42:01] <last1> no, '@' is just that '@' symbol
[20:42:06] <last1> it has no specific meaning
[20:42:15] <warrenparsons> @ is not valid in classes or IDs.
[20:43:02] <last1> ok, then try this: http://jsfiddle.net/5ApSa/19/
[20:43:06] <last1> replaced '@' by B
[20:43:48] <warrenparsons> Sorry, what is '%o' supposed to represent?
[20:44:14] <last1> to print the object to console
[20:44:19] * warrenparsons is a little drunk, for those just joining us.
[20:45:05] <warrenparsons> Ahh, you're right.
[20:45:13] <warrenparsons> Sorry, thought it was in a jQuery selector.
[20:45:17] <Sora_> omg i dont know this @ is no valid

[20:47:04] <warrenparsons> Fuckers. Changing stuff on us when nobody's lookin'...
[20:47:08] <vmasto> almost all unicode chars are valid in HTML5 for both ids and classes
[20:47:21] <Sora_> xD
[20:47:38] <vmasto> I believe @ is valid for classes only even in HTML4
[20:47:49] <warrenparsons> That's right! Frickin' hearts and accented "e" are valid now!
[20:48:14] <warrenparsons> My team members are gonna hate my ass tomorrow.
[20:48:33] <Sora_> womg why ??
[20:48:50] <warrenparsons> "Why the fuck won't this work?!" Little do they know I've started using spanish accented characters in class names.

[20:56:28] <tomasm-> anyone here use jquery ui stars, and can explain why the stars are being put at the bottom of the form?
[20:56:31] <coldhead> ever written* good grief
[20:56:32] <bufferxyz> Hi, I wonder if anyone can point me to the right direction to do this: I am trying to do upload a form with 3 images, but I want to display the thumbnail immediately after the image have to submitted, but not the form itself. Is there any way to do this?
[20:56:57] <coldhead> ?g jquery blueimp upload @ bufferxyz
[20:56:58] <bot-t1> bufferxyz, blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload - GitHub - https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[20:57:06] <coldhead> you need to use something like that, bufferxyz
[20:57:12] <warrenparsons> last1: I would think .val() and .attr('value') would return the same thing in your case. So odd.
[20:57:18] <coldhead> and have it return an URL to the thumbs
[20:58:01] <bufferxyz> I see, thanks a lot guys!
[20:58:04] <last1> warren: I know. let me update the example
[20:58:47] <Sora_> http://jsfiddle.net/Sora/5ApSa/25/
[21:00:42] <warrenparsons> last1: .val() works on my end.
[21:00:46] <last1> it works now!
[21:00:49] <vmasto> days like this i hate myself and javascript
[21:00:50] <last1> sora: what did you change ?
[21:00:56] * warrenparsons finally opened his console. He's a lazy fucker.
[21:01:33] <Sora_> console.log
[21:01:41] <warrenparsons> Funny how vodka causes the profanity to flow more freely.
[21:01:48] <Sora_> hahaha
[21:01:49] <Sora_> xD
[21:01:55] <coldhead> that's the russian aspect, warrenparsons
[21:02:00] <warrenparsons> coldhead: Good point.
[21:02:03] <Sora_> wtf
[21:02:07] <Sora_> im  chilean
[21:02:18] <warrenparsons> Sora_: You fuckers make some good red wine.
[21:02:26] <Sora_> yeah
[21:02:26] <coldhead> russian has over 200 obscene words for "chicken wrangler"
[21:02:30] <Sora_> but i dont like :(
[21:02:35] <warrenparsons> Sora_: Learn!
[21:02:52] <coldhead> chileans also do brilliant steak
[21:02:53] <warrenparsons> Oh god, red wine is the god of alcohol.
[21:03:00] <Sora_> only syrah :(
[21:03:07] <Sora_> yep but...
[21:03:25] <Sora_> im vodka addict :(
[21:03:53] <vmasto> last1: warrenparsons it has always worked, it's just you didnt put #u in the  mytr selector, you put *u
[21:04:12] <warrenparsons> vmasto: It wasn't my *
[21:04:19] <vmasto> i know :P
[21:04:23] <warrenparsons> I claim no responsibility.
[21:04:24] <Sora_> xD
[21:04:26] <warrenparsons> Vodka.
[21:04:31] <Sora_> yeah
[21:04:33] <warrenparsons> It's the devil.
[21:04:36] <last1> vmasto: I actually played with all options
[21:04:40] <Sora_> hahahahahaha
[21:04:40] <coldhead> u is a terrible ID
[21:05:05] <last1> I added the 'u' in front since ID's can't start with numbers
[21:05:18] <last1> and I had dynamically generated id's which did have numbers in front..
[21:05:21] <warrenparsons> last1: Seems a reasonable prefix for IDs...
[21:05:34] <vmasto> they can in html5 :p
[21:05:43] <warrenparsons> HTML5 is the devil.
[21:05:48] <warrenparsons> Damn black magic.
[21:05:53] <last1> vmasto: the reason why it didn't work all along is because of the @ sign
[21:06:08] <vmasto> yes you probably need to escape that
[21:06:19] <last1> so despite ff & chrome supporting html 5..they were crapping because of it
[21:06:29] <Sora_> but wtf is %o in regex ??
[21:06:39] <last1> %o is object
[21:06:43] <Sora_> ok ok
[21:06:54] <vmasto> http://mothereffingcssescapes.com/#@
[21:07:01] <Sora_> but the return is object O.o
[21:07:04] <warrenparsons> I'm betting the change in ID/class naming rigor is the departure from the misguided attempt at XML conformity.
[21:07:11] <warrenparsons> That was amazingly coherent.
[21:07:27] <last1> drink up :)
[21:07:32] <warrenparsons> No kiddin'
[21:08:20] <coldhead> numbers are terrible IDs
[21:08:34] <Eviltwin> Numbers are very descriptive
[21:08:37] <warrenparsons> coldhead: Agreed. Looney Toons character names are much preferable.
[21:09:02] <last1> i'm actually dealing with e-mail addresses that I have to store as the tr id
[21:09:13] <last1> some e-mails might be: 123@domain.com
[21:09:21] <last1> so that's a double fault: digits in front & @
[21:09:48] <last1> I thought I solved it by adding 'u'+email
[21:10:21] <warrenparsons> $('#elmerFudd').find('#daffy').on('click', function(){ $('#bugsBunny').hide() };
[21:10:28] <warrenparsons> Very intuitive.
[21:10:34] <vmasto> dude, seriously just use html5 and data properti
[21:10:38] <vmasto> property* :)
[21:10:44] <coldhead> id="porkypig"
[21:10:48] <coldhead> that's saying what you mean
[21:11:16] <last1> I have to build this for people that still use ancient browsers unfortunately
[21:11:30] <VarunBatra> Are there anything like css sprite on fly generator if codes are written in php?
[21:11:37] <ajpiano> lol using an email address as an id attriube
[21:11:41] <ajpiano> whether or not you prefix it
[21:11:42] <Sora_> well u send mail with js ??
[21:11:49] <ajpiano> sounds like someone's reading aloud from the Book Of Bad Ideas
[21:11:52] <Sora_> O.o?
[21:11:55] <warrenparsons> last1: You could use an HTML5 doctype regardless, but jQuery still might not work.
[21:12:34] <warrenparsons> ajpiano: Don't bring reason into this. We're solving problem!
[21:12:36] <warrenparsons> s
[21:12:48] <last1> ajpiano: what else should I be using ?
[21:12:56] <last1> the record id ?
[21:12:59] <ajpiano> yep
[21:13:05] <ajpiano> that's literally what i was about to type
[21:13:26] <coldhead> vmasto: you still got a problem you want to ask ajpiano about?
[21:13:31] <last1> but with a prefix right ? :)
[21:13:34] <coldhead> because now is a good time
[21:13:41] <vmasto2> yes!
[21:13:49] <warrenparsons> Okay, gotta sign off. 'Night folks.
[21:13:50] <ajpiano> coldhead: now that's a bit of an exaggeration
[21:14:00] <ajpiano> last1: yep
[21:14:03] <Sora_> warrenparsons: adew!
[21:14:04] <amites> Any ideas why this snippet works for the first checkbox and not the 2nd?? http://jsfiddle.net/aXPkb/
[21:14:18] <coldhead> now is an adequate time*
[21:14:21] <Sora_> well mee too...
[21:14:27] <coldhead> it's very mild, ajpiano
[21:14:30] <coldhead> exceedingly mild
[21:14:38] <Sora_> adew!
[21:14:44] <coldhead> something you fix a hundred times every day
[21:14:51] <coldhead> in the act of tying your laces
[21:14:59] <coldhead> adieu*
[21:15:03] <Sora_> :O
[21:15:13] <coldhead> you're not very convincing as a french person
[21:15:28] <Sora_> is adew catalan
[21:15:29] <Sora_> xD
[21:15:32] <Sora_> ^^;
[21:16:25] <vmasto> ajpiano: Got any idea why every custom event I try to attach in the jQuery UI Tabs links is ignored by them? for example if I change the event to 'change' and then try something like $("#tabs ul li a").click(doSomething); it gets completely ignored
[21:16:49] <vmasto> thus breaking ben_alman_ 's BBQ plugin with them :(
[21:16:52] <ajpiano> wat
[21:16:57] <ajpiano> if you change what event to change
[21:17:05] <vmasto> the main event in the Tabs Options
[21:17:19] <vmasto> the event that actually triggers the change in tabs
[21:17:25] <vmasto> default is click
[21:17:29] <ajpiano> how would you use a change event as the triggering event
[21:17:35] <vmasto> hashchange
[21:17:40] <vmasto> for BBQ plugin
[21:17:52] <ajpiano> 'change' isn't the name of that event
[21:18:11] <coldhead> ajpiano: he wants to use UI tabs AND bbq
[21:18:13] <last1> and it looks like not even dots . are allowed in id's
[21:18:27] <ajpiano> well that's convenient
[21:18:31] <coldhead> you can escape them, last1
[21:18:32] <ajpiano> there's like, demos of how to do that ON BEN'S WEBSITE
[21:18:36] <coldhead> but better not to use them
[21:18:40] <vmasto> that's how ben_alman_ does it in his demo page: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/fragment-jquery-ui-tabs/
[21:18:49] <coldhead> i linked already, ajpiano, he suspects there is a version difference
[21:19:17] <ajpiano> hmm well i'll tell you what
[21:19:38] <ajpiano> tomorrow night my self and ben_alman_ and our significant others are going to see a broadway show and eat a fancy dinner
[21:19:47] <ajpiano> what i'll do is interrupt that
[21:19:53] <ajpiano> and see if we can't figure this out
[21:19:55] <ajpiano> RIGHT AT DINNER
[21:20:33] <ajpiano> vmasto: are you following the example all the way through?
[21:20:38] <ajpiano> doing the triggerHandler etc ?
[21:21:13] <vmasto> yup:/
[21:21:32] <ajpiano> hold on let me psychically connect with the code you've written
[21:21:37] <vmasto> plus, in jQuery 1.8 there's no hashchange anymore, so I had to custom write it
[21:21:43] <ajpiano> and debug it using transcendental meditation
[21:21:51] <ajpiano> vmasto: there never was a hashchange event in any version of jquery
[21:21:57] <ajpiano> including the non existent "jQuery 1.8"
[21:22:05] <vmasto> not the event
[21:22:08] <vmasto> I mean jQuery UI
[21:22:21] <vmasto> anyway, no worries thanks for your time, obviously you aren't in the mood :)
[21:22:38] <coldhead> i think the real point is that AJPIANO LIKES BROADWAY SHOWS
[21:22:49] <ajpiano> i'm in the mood to see a jsfiddle version of your verison of ben's example and see it breaking
[21:22:54] <bufferxyz> I wonder if anyone knows how iCloud's profile photo picker is done?
[21:23:04] <coldhead> vmasto: do as he says and no one gets hurt
[21:23:08] <bufferxyz> Is it using SproutCore's library?
[21:23:13] <ajpiano> well, i wouldn't say "in the mood" but, more so than just conjecture
[21:24:23] <coldhead> open to?
[21:24:31] <ajpiano> also it should be noted i just returned home from a 4 hour train ride
[21:26:03] <ajpiano> to an apartment that smells like the decaying dregs of my hawaiian dinner on tuesday
[21:27:20] <coldhead> hawaiian dinner is a thing?
[21:27:35] <coldhead> there is a fijian restaurant near me but no one goes there except to die
[21:27:57] <coldhead> i've seen 2 deceased old fijians being stetchered out
[21:28:04] <coldhead> kind of makes you less hungry
[21:28:24] <ajpiano> i was just as shocked as you were
[21:28:37] <ajpiano> to find Hwaiian Island Grill on the list of nearby restaurants
[21:30:23] <coldhead> how is the cuisine?
[21:30:30] <coldhead> will you be returning?
[21:30:31] <ajpiano> it was really the bees knees
[21:30:37] <ajpiano> perhaps
[21:30:41] <coldhead> charming
[21:30:49] <ajpiano> the gentleman who delivered it shall certianly be returning here
[21:31:04] <coldhead> i am imagining it's like our islanders eat, which is basically one thing: pig thrown in a fire in a pit
[21:31:09] <coldhead> hahah
[21:31:28] <ajpiano> more or lesss it was that
[21:33:17] <vmasto> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/hpZxr/4/ I guess that should do it
[21:33:38] <vmasto> nothing happens when you click the links, the custom click event gets ignored
[21:37:10] <vmasto> if you instead change the tab options to event: "click" (default) the tabs work again, but bbq doesn't work
[21:37:41] <coldhead> you can do this, aj, i believe in you
[21:42:50] <vmasto> to overcome the hashchange problem (jQuery UI 1.8 seems to have stopped updating window.location.hash with every click) I did this http://jsfiddle.net/hpZxr/5/ (adding the hash to the url on my own). but if you change the event from 'click' to 'change' as Ben demonstrates, it gets ignored completely
[21:43:38] <ajpiano> vmasto: so
[21:43:43] <ajpiano> the difference between your and ben's example
[21:43:48] <ajpiano> is that ben's actually meaningfully gets the index
[21:43:57] <ajpiano> whereas yours hardcodes the index at 0 every time
[21:44:10] <vmasto> i hardcoded it because there's only one tab
[21:44:12] <ajpiano> so when the events fire... it just says "trigger a click on the 0th tab no matter what changed"
[21:44:28] <ajpiano> not in that example
[21:44:29] <ajpiano> in any case
[21:44:32] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/hpZxr/6/ seems to work fine
[21:47:55] <coldhead> can we close this case, vmasto ?
[21:49:30] <vmasto> indeed :)
[21:49:33] <amites> any ideas why this input is always testing as not checked? running same code on 2 checkboxes to test for showing or hiding a div - first one works - 2nd one hides every time together and alone http://jsfiddle.net/aXPkb/
[21:49:40] <vmasto> thanks ajpiano and coldhead , much appreciated
[21:50:11] <ajpiano> no prob
[21:50:17] <coldhead> ?cc
[21:50:17] <bot-t1> CASE CLOASED >: |
[21:50:20] <coldhead> thanks aj
[21:50:27] <ajpiano> just out of curiousity.... did you debug this at all to do basic things like "see which tab you were triggering the event on" etc?
[21:50:31] <coldhead> i told you, vmasto !
[21:51:56] <vmasto> ajpiano: no, I mixed up the selector (when he does find) and immediately jumped to the conclusion that it's broken because of jQuery UI being a different version not adding the hash to the url
[21:52:30] <vmasto> and then it was just blindness for 3 hours
[21:52:36] <ajpiano> next time, console.log() to conclusions
[21:52:47] <ajpiano> find out how far the program is getting and being right
[21:52:52] <ajpiano> and then you'll figure out where it is going wrong
[21:53:55] <clear-in> hi.. how to  get the size or lenght of the data from json. i already tried .lenght
[21:54:04] <coldhead> you should make a site with tips like that, aj
[21:54:15] <vmasto> clear-in: maybe because it's spelled .length ? :)
[21:54:26] <ajpiano> sorry the only tips i have are in steak form these days
[21:54:39] <clear-in> sorry.. i yes its lenght.
[21:54:45] <Cork> clear-in: if its really json thatn its just a string, if its a javascript object though, you can't know its length
[21:54:58] <vmasto> ehm.. again, it's length
[21:55:17] <clear-in> cork.. ok tnx
[21:55:28] <SergSergiu> hello
[21:55:29] <clear-in> vmasto.. sorry i type it wrongd.
[21:55:30] <clear-in> :)
[21:55:36] <clear-in> but thanks anyway :)
[21:55:57] <Cork> clear-in: converted json, thats an array has .length, so it depends on what data you have in your json
[21:56:10] <vmasto> np, just making sure you typed it correctly in your code
[21:56:17] <vmasto> before anything else
[21:57:43] <SergSergiu> i try to use http://www.coursesweb.net/ajax/ajax-post-php , ajax post ,and i try to replace <div id="txt2">example</div> with <textarea id="txt2"></textarea> , and not running, can help me someone to use this ajax post with input/textarea form?
[21:58:12] <dw> hmmz
[21:58:22] <ajpiano> SergSergiu: consider using jQuery
[21:58:26] <ajpiano> SergSergiu: in any event
[21:58:33] <dw> when i .clone() an element with id=, the clone also has id=. what is the behaviour when i append that to the document?
[21:58:39] <ajpiano> you need to get the value of a textarea, not its innerHTML
[21:58:50] <dw> currently i remove the id attribute before append. but wondering if that can be avoided somehow
[21:58:55] <ajpiano> dwarder_: $("#foo").clone().attr("id", "bar").appendTo( document.body );
[21:59:03] <ajpiano> hm no you def gotta manipulate it
[21:59:07] <dw> yep. i have a 'cloneTemplate' to do that with
[21:59:11] <ajpiano> OR use actual templateing instead
[21:59:15] <dw> just trying to remove these little helpers
[21:59:23] <ajpiano> of clone-based, manipulate an element after poor-mans templating
[21:59:48] <ajpiano> there's only like 7 bajillion javascript templating solutions
[21:59:53] <dw> it works well, and makes it natural to avoid quoting and escaping issues
[22:00:13] * clear-in slaps vmasto around a bit with a large kaldero.
[22:00:19] <dw> sure traversing a big object tree in ram is probably slower than a bit of string parsing. but you get a nice api that avoids common problems :)
[22:00:41] <clear-in> lol.. you are right!. i typed it wrong. lol many thanks to you and Cork :)
[22:00:50] <ajpiano> dw what "common problems" are there with decent js templating libs that are somehow avoided by cloning elements and walking them like a DOM
[22:01:02] <dw> its not the templating libs, its the developers
[22:01:17] <ajpiano> didn't you hire them
[22:01:30] <dw> and the 'the developers' i mean its been 10 years and i still use the wrong escaping function on a regular basis
[22:01:51] <ajpiano> i've never had to manually escape anything when using a templating engine....
[22:02:15] <dw> ajpiano: recommend me one?
[22:02:16] <ajpiano> ah but yes
[22:02:18] <ajpiano> legacy code :/
[22:02:46] <ajpiano> dw: underscore, handelbars, mustache, weld, combyne, jquery templates, jsrender,
[22:02:48] <ajpiano> etc.
[22:03:33] <twolfson> EJS =D
[22:03:40] <ajpiano> yep
[22:03:54] <dw> im not feeling compelled right now :)
[22:03:55] <twolfson> they are all interchangable basically
[22:04:05] <ajpiano> jade
[22:04:09] <twolfson> meh
[22:04:16] <ajpiano> dw, well then, welcome to las vegas
[22:04:21] <dw> hehe
[22:04:23] <ajpiano> you'll be staying here on the Strip
[22:04:24] <ajpiano> as in
[22:04:27] <ajpiano> Strip Out The Id
[22:04:41] <dw> yeah, it works, not breaking it
[22:05:02] <ajpiano> yeah i wouldn't try to wedge a modern templating engine into a 10 yr old app either, fair enough
[22:05:41] <dw> the other thing is, cleaning this code up, half the logic was previously embedded in Template::Toolkit
[22:05:45] <twolfson> somtimes I want IRC to populate the channel from before I joined =(
[22:06:22] <dw> now there's a .js and a .html, and some .pl in the background
[22:06:29] <dw> all 3 are readable
[22:06:30] <ajpiano> twolfson: get a bouncer :)
[22:07:16] <twolfson> lol, I think I will just let the program idle from now on
[22:07:39] <ajpiano> still nice to have the BNC
[22:07:40] <ajpiano> ?znc
[22:07:42] <bot-t1> ajpiano, The Pug Automatic - http://henrik.nyh.se/
[22:07:45] <ajpiano> arg
[22:07:46] <ajpiano> ?bnc
[22:07:46] <bot-t1> An IRC bouncer (bnc) is a little app that sits on a server and keeps you connected to IRC. Instead of connecting to an IRC server directly, you connect to your server using whichever client and port you like, and it resumes your session. ZNC (http://en.znc.in/wiki/ZNC) makes this ridiculously easy.
[22:08:03] <twolfson> neat
[22:08:18] <ajpiano> it plays back the buffer when you reconnect
[22:08:30] <ajpiano> also great for: not annoying people when you are on a terrible wifi connection
[22:09:02] <dw> the annoying thing with bnc is it can't preserve timestamps
[22:09:07] <dw> which breaks obsessive loggers like me ;)
[22:09:14] <twolfson> that sucks
[22:09:21] <twolfson> but it is better than no logs at all
[22:09:29] <ajpiano> yea the timestamps i see are always a bit weird, never bothered fixing it
[22:09:45] <clear-in> http://jsfiddle.net/KThz6/
[22:09:46] <ajpiano> i just like having the context for the last bit before i connecte
[22:09:49] <clear-in> autocomplete
[22:10:07] <clear-in> please help me with my autocompleter
[22:10:36] <clear-in> i want to make it auto select if the return value length is 1.
[22:22:12] <clear-in> ok. ajpiano
[22:22:15] <twolfson> lol, triggering a mouse action
[22:22:15] <clear-in> tnx
[22:22:27] <twolfson> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Autocomplete#method-close
[22:22:30] <twolfson> I was going to use that =P
[22:22:36] <clear-in> and twolfson tnx
[22:23:23] <twolfson> yw =)
[22:23:36] <ajpiano> twolfson: it works with any object that has a type property, apparently http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/KThz6/2/
[22:25:39] <twolfson> interesting
[22:25:49] <twolfson> prob because it doesn't care about the actual event data
[22:25:52] <ajpiano> yep
[22:25:54] <twolfson> just needs to click
[22:26:23] <ajpiano> not even, it needs to just "set the active state on an element" and then the select element just... selects whatever is stored as active
[22:26:29] <clear-in> ajpiano
[22:26:39] <clear-in> menu.activate( {type: "WAT"} , items);     <- what is type: "WAT" ?
[22:26:48] <twolfson> lol
[22:26:57] <ajpiano> clear-in: it's garbage input that demonstrates that it works on any object with a type property
[22:27:08] <ajpiano> see also https://github.com/gf3/WAT/blob/master/wat.json
[22:30:34] <coldhead> it certainly looks nicer
[22:30:54] <coldhead> look at this thing a guy made: http://tinkerbin.com/HF9HJsAt
[22:30:59] <twolfson> the trick to making it auto-update
[22:31:07] <twolfson> is putting everything in the HTML tab
[22:31:21] <ajpiano> it clearly has some nifty features but until you can import external resources, mock ajax requests, etc
[22:31:25] <twolfson> using <style> and <script> as God intended
[22:31:29] <twolfson> aka Tim Berners Lee
[22:31:40] <ajpiano> jsfiddle probably is a lot more ... useful
[22:31:57] <twolfson> omg that is awesome =o
[22:32:21] <ajpiano> adorbs
[22:32:43] <clear-in> cool
[22:33:11] <coldhead> you can win pretty much anything by citing TBL
[22:33:36] <coldhead> "well that was the worst oral sex i've ever experienced, according to the father of the web"
[22:33:40] <coldhead> and there's no comeback
[22:34:18] <ajpiano> "take it to the bridge"
[22:34:19] <ajpiano> oh
[22:34:23] <ajpiano> you're talking about tim berners lee
[22:34:28] <ajpiano> not timbaland
[22:35:15] <coldhead> i think timbaland works too
[22:35:34] <coldhead> the important thing is maybe someone had oral sex
[22:36:04] <coldhead> you have to try to see the big picture
[22:36:08] <ajpiano> in soviet russia, they only have ural sex
[22:36:16] <ajpiano> #geographyjokes
[22:36:59] <coldhead> see sometimes you run straight to the bottom of the barrel
[22:37:01] <crab> hi ajpiano (and coldhead)
[22:37:04] <coldhead> no steady decline
[22:37:07] <coldhead> and i can't keep up
[22:38:00] <ajpiano> you know what's weird
[22:38:09] <coldhead> hi crab
[22:38:12] <ajpiano> how sometimes, "uphill" is good and "downhill" is bad
[22:38:19] <crab> ajpiano: i still have that validation/organisation question to ask your advice about. got time to listen?
[22:38:20] <ajpiano> and other times "uphill" is bad and "downhill" is good
[22:38:32] <coldhead> when is downhill good?
[22:38:36] <crab> i managed to figure out how to state the problem concisely, but the code is still a mess.
[22:38:40] <coldhead> UR weird, you ajpianogator
[22:38:44] <twolfson> on a bike
[22:38:44] <ajpiano> crab: i am.... here
[22:38:59] <ajpiano> or when "it's all downhill" as in "it is smooth sailing from this point forward"
[22:39:08] <coldhead> he is watching an adult film, crab
[22:39:11] <djQuery> am i using on wrong ?  $('table').on('click','tr', function(){});
[22:39:16] <ajpiano> using one metaphor to describe another
[22:39:20] <coldhead> probably something about nixon
[22:39:56] <twolfson> $('table').delegate
[22:39:57] <coldhead> i have never heard something said to be going downhill in a good way
[22:39:58] <ajpiano> crab: i don't recall even what we had discussed
[22:40:21] <crab> ajpiano: ok. i have a table. each row contains some input fields (specifically: start hour, end hour, volume-1, volume-2, price), and there's a button to add a new empty row. i have to check, for each row, that the values are sensible (which includes calculating volume-2 from volume-1, checking that the end hour is after the start hour, etc.)
[22:40:25] <ajpiano> djQuery: looks good
[22:40:38] <djQuery> hmm not doing anything
[22:40:50] <ajpiano> twolfson: delegate is SO PASSÃ‰
[22:41:01] <djQuery> click the calculate button then click on a row. http://jsbin.com/oquxuk/28/edit
[22:41:12] <coldhead> crab: alert("PLease use common sense when filling out this form");
[22:41:15] <crab> ajpiano: the code i wrote to do this is http://toroid.org/misc/validate.js, which is called via .delegate on 'change' to any input field with the relevant class.
[22:41:15] <djQuery> takes a sec to generate the rows.
[22:41:46] <twolfson> delegate does bubbling
[22:41:51] <twolfson> so good
[22:41:51] <crab> coldhead: if only!
[22:42:14] <ajpiano> twolfson: so does .on
[22:42:38] <ajpiano> it's "the new hotness"
[22:43:25] <crab> actually, there's a lot of derivation going on. if you fill in a start hour, it sets end hour to that plus 1 or 2, depending. and so on.
[22:43:27] <djQuery> oh its probably because I am cloning the table?
[22:43:36] <djQuery> so its not attached to the clone?
[22:44:17] <ajpiano> hmm crab realistically speaking
[22:44:25] <ajpiano> it is definitely not a good time to get my opinion on this code
[22:44:28] <djQuery> that did it $(document).on('click','tbody tr', function(){
[22:45:16] <ajpiano> now there's the djQuery we all know and love
[22:45:19] <crab> ajpiano: ok :-/
[22:45:26] <coldhead> three words, crab: FINITE. STATE. MACHINE.
[22:46:01] <crab> coldhead: my code IS a sort of FSM.
[22:46:02] <djQuery> well the stupid table sorter wouldnt allow me to add rows so I have to drop the table then get a fresh copy of it
[22:46:17] <ajpiano> djQuery: tablesorter lets you add rows
[22:46:24] <coldhead> that's what i figured, crab
[22:46:25] <ajpiano> you just have to .trigger("update") afterward
[22:46:38] <coldhead> but maybe if you make it more finitey and statey it might be better?
[22:46:39] <crab> tablesnorter
[22:47:35] <djQuery> it wouldnt allow me to remove rows was the issur.   $('tbody').find('tr').remove();   do my loops to add rows then the old rows would still be there
[22:48:08] * ajpiano skeptical
[22:48:40] * ajpiano too late to debug
[22:49:11] <coldhead> crab: maybe this helps? http://tinkerbin.com/HF9HJsAt
[22:50:17] <crab> that... doesn't help at all
[22:50:29] <ajpiano> crab: i have only watched the first few minutes of this talk so far http://confreaks.net/videos/614-cascadiaruby2011-confident-code (http://avdi.org/talks/confident-code-rubymidwest-2011/confident-code.html)
[22:50:48] <ajpiano> but even in the first five minutes
[22:51:06] <ajpiano> he talks about things like not mixing business logic, error handling, user input gathering, etc. all inside of one function
[22:51:38] <ajpiano> .... which is what you're totes mcgrotes doing
[22:51:50] <ajpiano> i wonder if he explains the solution
[22:51:59] <crab> ajpiano: you don't need to beat me with a stick :-), i already know my code should be better.
[22:52:16] <coldhead> how can he be taken seriosuly with that long girlish hair?
[22:52:21] <ajpiano> when i beat you with a stick, you'll know it?
[22:52:31] <ajpiano> coldhead: yeah i know right, freakin, go play a saxophone amirite
[22:54:01] <coldhead> URITE!
[22:54:49] <crab> the only idea i've had is to use pub/sub and attach a validator and an other-field-updater to each "changed" event.
[22:55:15] <crab> but it didn't help much, and i had to jump through some extra contortions to do cross-row validation.
[22:59:37] <twolfson> why don't you just have one function that collects all form data
[22:59:45] <twolfson> and publishes that on a change
[23:00:04] <crab> twolfson: that's pretty much what i have now.
[23:00:06] <twolfson> then validation would have no problem
[23:00:17] <twolfson> oh, ok then
[23:00:46] <crab> it's one big honking function that i can't always understand myself though
[23:00:51] <coldhead> maybe TWO finite state machines
[23:01:07] <twolfson> that's bad
[23:01:11] <twolfson> you should DRY that
[23:01:20] <coldhead> fewer finite state machines
[23:01:22] <coldhead> i understand
[23:01:28] <twolfson> lol
[23:01:32] <twolfson> ty coldhead
[23:01:54] <crab> thanks. i have taken your valuable suggestions into consideration, and will be sure to raise them at the next annual meeting.
[23:02:13] <coldhead> hhahahah
[23:02:26] <coldhead> meetings are hilarious
[23:02:35] <twolfson> lol
[23:02:36] <ajpiano> crab: at a very high level i would say you should like, object orient your code a bi
[23:02:44] <ajpiano> have a bid and a collection of bids
[23:02:58] <ajpiano> bids know their own input, are incharge of the dom inside of them, validate themselves
[23:02:58] <coldhead> and the objects should be finite state machines, right?
[23:03:15] <djQuery> hmmm hover works even when the window doesnt have focus
[23:03:17] <ajpiano> and then if those all validate, you do some more validation on the collection based on what it knows about the bids inside ofit
[23:03:22] <ajpiano> but that's pretty obtuse
[23:03:30] <ajpiano> or not, depending on how ready you are to hear it
[23:03:33] <ajpiano> why do i keep typing
[23:03:34] <ajpiano> :/
[23:04:24] <crab> hmm, each of my <tr>s could become an (or correspond to an) object then
[23:04:54] <ajpiano> yep. and the logical object has the tr as a property
[23:05:06] <ajpiano> you want to put your application in charge
[23:05:07] <ajpiano> not the DOM
[23:05:20] <crab> how should i hook up the on-change functions?
[23:06:09] <ajpiano> you would have input fields correspond to the attributes of the object
[23:06:19] <ajpiano> when the input fields change, all you do is set the internal attribute
[23:06:58] <ajpiano> then that triggers validation and calculations, which takes place against the actual internal attributes of the object, not against shit you just pulled out of a bajillion dom elements
[23:07:39] <crab> (would you suggest using backbone or something to do this?)
[23:07:51] <ajpiano> backbone would be useful, you don't need it though
[23:08:05] <ajpiano> the point is... this code is completely stateless
[23:08:24] <ajpiano> every single time you validate you go and gather up every single piece of information about the app from the dom, and then do a bunch of stuff with it
[23:08:30] <ajpiano> you should *already know* most of the stuff
[23:09:05] <coldhead> hail chicken caesar!
[23:09:19] <crab> ok
[23:10:01] <crab> makes sense. i'll reorganise it this way and see how it looks.
[23:10:06] <crab> thanks for reading through $code
[23:10:41] <ajpiano> np, thanks for constantly endeavouring for self-improvement
[23:11:13] <coldhead> you're both very inspirational
[23:11:32] <coldhead> sometimes i almost feel strong enough to take the noose down from over my desk
[23:11:36] <coldhead> and just end it all with pills
[23:19:55] <coldhead> welcome back, blackspotwiggins
[23:20:40] <blackspotwiggins> hey coldhead
[23:25:12] <djQuery> ok its that table sorter has a problem when there are more than 2 places after the decimal
[23:25:25] <djQuery> back to documentation
[23:44:04] <CodeZombie> finally figured it out!
[23:44:04] <CodeZombie> https://gist.github.com/1ddfa75ad9b2a356e7f7
[23:50:28] <twolfson> dude...
[23:50:31] <twolfson> don't ever do that
[23:50:37] <twolfson> also not supported in FF
[23:50:40] <twolfson> or Chrome
[23:50:54] <twolfson> because people were dicks in the 90s with that
[23:53:52] <CodeZombie> I tested it in FF, works fine
[23:54:00] <twolfson> is this for a pop-up?
[23:54:03] <CodeZombie> nope
[23:54:11] <CodeZombie> 100% height on fluid with layout
[23:54:11] <twolfson> are you using the latest version of FF?
[23:54:13] <CodeZombie> no footer
[23:54:15] <CodeZombie> yup
[23:54:19] <twolfson> wierd shit
[23:54:59] <CodeZombie> couldn't find any other way to specify 100% height cross browser
[23:55:08] <CodeZombie> ...that actually worked
[23:55:35] <twolfson> I am not sure what you mean by 100% height cross browser
[23:55:50] <twolfson> you mean you want the window at the full height of the document?
[23:56:14] <twolfson> so there are no scrollbars?
[23:56:19] <CodeZombie> meaning, a layout that is always 100% height of the viewable area, with 100% sidebars, without a footer
[23:56:51] <CodeZombie> it will expand for content if it exists, ( probably could remove that part from the script, and use css )
[23:57:04] <twolfson> css can do that...
[23:57:12] <CodeZombie> not completely
[23:57:12] <twolfson> well
[23:57:22] <twolfson> there will be scrollbars
[23:57:27] <twolfson> wait
[23:57:27] <CodeZombie> yeah, no scrollbars
[23:57:28] <twolfson> nvm
[23:58:00] <CodeZombie> I use some overflow hidden areas for image manipulation ( part of the project ), which needs scrollbars, and more than one scrollbar is just ugly
[23:58:09] <twolfson> #content { height: 100%; margin-top: -200px; /* header height */ }
[23:58:18] <twolfson> #header { height: 200px; }
[23:58:28] <CodeZombie> had issues in ie with negative margins
[23:58:38] <twolfson> you mean IE6?
[23:58:43] <CodeZombie> 7 too
[23:58:47] <twolfson> -_-
[23:58:51] <CodeZombie> not that I'm shooting for ie6, but 7 is a requirement
[23:58:55] <twolfson> lol
[23:59:10] <twolfson> well
[23:59:18] <twolfson> you can also position: absolute
[23:59:37] <CodeZombie> I did that as well, unleashed a whole fury of ridiculous amounts of css throughout the rest of the site
[23:59:37] <twolfson> if you are >always< going to have the content under the window height
[23:59:49] <CodeZombie> and yeah, not always
