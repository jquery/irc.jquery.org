[00:01:48] <wkmanire> Evelynn: Oh ok. I'm just spoiled. Not used to reading code out of my IRC client.
[00:01:54] <wkmanire> anyway, best I can tell you are doing it right.
[00:13:49] <simoncpu> hi, i have this problem where jQuery won't parse the JSON output of my web app
[00:13:58] <simoncpu> when it returns an HTTP 500 error
[00:14:18] <simoncpu> how can i let jQuery parse the JSON so that I can do a real REST API?
[00:15:22] <simoncpu> sending an HTTP 200 OK for an error message encoded in JSON doesn't make sense
[00:16:27] <Cork> simoncpu: you would have to catch the error event
[00:16:34] <Cork> or rather the error callback
[00:17:04] <simoncpu> ahhh
[00:17:47] <Cork> simoncpu: from a quick look through the doc, it looks like getJSON might not have it
[00:18:01] <Cork> so i would prob use $.ajax instead (type: 'json')
[00:18:22] <simoncpu> would $.post.error() work?
[00:20:14] <Engin> I'd return my status codes with HTTP 200
[00:20:23] <Engin> after all that is your application level protocol
[00:20:25] <simoncpu> cool, it works
[00:20:27] <simoncpu> thanks!
[00:20:50] <simoncpu> Engin: i think REST advocates the use of HTTP codes for errors hehe
[00:22:38] <Engin> well, I made a graph-api like api long before they call it grap api with HTTP 200 and status codes inside, it was quite smooth for me and others to use... but that's not a whole lot of experience to make a shot on that for sure. though, I foresee implementation problems with HTTP codes, just 200 and status code inside is easier to use.
[00:23:30] <Engin> simoncpu, if you have an article that advocates http codes with reasons I'd be glad to read it.
[00:30:27] <simoncpu> Engin: http://www.dalouche.com/wordpress/2009/04/25/error-handling-in-rest-applications-best-practices/
[00:30:36] <simoncpu> "ALWAYS return the most appropriate HTTP error code whenever an application error happens."
[00:30:45] <simoncpu> there was an article by Roy Fielding himself, but i can't find it
[00:31:40] <Cork> simoncpu: its simple to handle http status in ajax
[00:31:54] <Cork> its a native variable in the xhr object
[00:32:24] <Cork> and ya, i agree using http status codes reflecting what happens is nice
[00:32:44] <Cork> it makes it simple to collect all server comunication error handling in one place
[00:33:12] <simoncpu> yepp =)
[00:33:28] <hejki> hiya.. any ideas why $('select#select_box_id option').hover(..); works as intended with Firefox, but with Chromium i get no event callbacks at all?
[00:34:16] <Cork> hejki: i don't think webkit triggers events for option elements
[00:34:38] <liquid-silence> any good treeview with context menu's?
[00:35:08] <hejki> Cork: ahh. so "webkit sucks" is the reason? any workarounds?
[00:35:39] <Cork> hejki: no not really, its not demanded by the spec if i remember correctly
[00:35:39] <hejki> and please don't say "making your own selection box" :P
[00:35:48] <hejki> Cork: ahh ok
[00:35:56] <Cork> hejki: its just a side effect from how the interface is built in geckoo
[00:36:02] <Cork> -o
[00:36:05] <hejki> so i have to make my own selection box for more retarded browsers :|
[00:36:36] <Cork> hejki: not sure why you need hover on the options
[00:36:48] <hejki> hovering on selection option => tooltip
[00:37:15] <hejki> i also need the option value to fadeIn() the correct tooltip.. is that unobtainable in webkit as well?
[00:37:23] <Cork> have you tried title="" values?
[00:37:29] <Cork> (not sure if that works)
[00:37:42] <hejki> or should $('select#select_box_id option:selected').val() WAI?
[00:38:02] <Cork> $('select').val() will give the selected value
[00:38:14] <Cork> no need to involve the option there
[00:38:22] <hejki> Cork: i need HTML + CSS in the tooltips, can i somehow put dynamic content in title="" ?
[00:38:31] <Cork> no
[00:38:38] <hejki> yeha => no-go
[00:39:00] <hejki> so it's a self-made selection menu then :P
[00:39:09] <Cork> ya
[00:39:25] <Cork> hejki: jquery have one you can use
[00:39:31] <Cork> or rather jquery-ui
[00:40:28] <hejki> yeha, i know
[00:40:32] <hejki> i just figured that one out :P
[00:42:24] <hejki> but it doesn't act like the select box, or is that just a configuration question?
[00:43:24] <Cork> hejki: it converts a native select object into a styled one
[00:43:33] <Cork> hejki: it works the same
[00:43:48] <hejki> Cork: jQueryUI.selectable() ?
[00:44:01] <Cork> no
[00:44:56] <hejki> ahh.. selectmenu()
[00:46:58] <Cork> http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/branches/labs/selectmenu/index.html
[00:47:42] <rump> how do i set this jquery ui autocomplete box to autoSelect the first result?
[00:48:43] <hejki> Cork: is that in the current stable?
[00:49:03] <Cork> nope
[00:49:04] <Cork> status:  in planning
[00:49:11] <hejki> aww
[00:49:12] <Cork> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu
[00:49:50] <hejki> ahh
[00:50:13] <cfk_> normally submitting a form causes the browser to open another page ... how can i post data using .post() causing the browser to change url as well, so that, for example, the post data can be displayed by a php page, together with a thank you message?
[00:50:13] <Cork> the jquery-ui dev wiki has become really louse at informing what theyr doing
[00:50:22] <Cork> everything is more or less hidden :/
[00:59:52] <ravenzz> anyone from Oslo?
[01:01:47] <Cork> why do you ask?
[01:02:03] <ravenzz> i need an info
[01:02:04] <ravenzz> :f
[01:02:27] <Cork> ask for the info insted then :)
[01:02:54] <ravenzz> ahah but that's no jQuery related :)
[01:03:54] <Engin> text().trim() works in Chrome, FF, IE9 but not IE8
[01:04:06] <ravenzz> nice
[01:04:41] <Engin> actually should used like jQuery.trim(foo)
[01:04:42] <ravenzz> text().replace(/\s/g,"")
[01:04:50] <ravenzz> that's trim
[01:04:51] <Cork> Engin: ie pre 9 doesn't have trim
[01:04:53] <ravenzz> oh no
[01:04:54] <ravenzz> sorry
[01:04:58] <ravenzz> that's not trim
[01:05:44] <Cork> Engin: jquery doesn't provide functions for handling strings, only dom
[01:05:55] <Engin> actually should used like jQuery.trim(foo)
[01:06:07] <Engin> it works
[01:06:07] <Thomas`-> Hi. Anyone know why $('.myclass'')[0].html() would be giving me "Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method html"?
[01:06:15] <Engin> see the doc, it does not operate on dom
[01:06:30] <Cork> Thomas`-: [0] returns the dom object, not the jquery object
[01:06:41] <Cork> Thomas`-: use eq see ?.eq

[01:08:53] <Cork> ravenzz: interesting, an exception :)
[01:09:01] <Thomas`-> Cork, spent ages trying with [] and get().  thanks it works now!
[01:09:27] <Cork> Thomas`-: [] and .get returns the same thing
[01:09:33] <Cork> the dom native object
[01:10:00] <ravenzz> Indeed I found out some utilities few days ago http://api.jquery.com/category/utilities/
[01:10:18] <Thomas`-> ahh ok
[01:10:49] <Cork> ravenzz: i know about the others, i use inArray a lot
[01:10:59] <Cork> but somehow missed the trim completly

[01:23:54] <Cork> catcatcat: navigator.plugins is an array
[01:24:07] <Cork> you could call it index if you prefer

[01:25:23] <Cork> catcatcat: "name" and "#{ name } #{ version }"

[01:41:27] <Patatouf> hello ! i would like to use $.ajax to request the following url http://sc2ranks.com/api/base/teams/eu/Patatouf$223.json?appKey=github.com%2Fameerkat%2Fsc2ranks-php and print what it return (a json var i guess), how can I do that ?
[01:43:02] <Patatouf> this is my code : http://pastebin.com/8mtLb2g8
[01:43:46] <Cork> Patatouf: you need to use jsonp if its cross domain
[01:44:04] <Patatouf> yes it is, jsonp ?
[01:44:44] <Cork> Patatouf: no the server returns json
[01:44:55] <Cork> you can't access that from cross domain
[01:45:51] <Patatouf> do you mean that I can't do what I would like ?
[01:46:47] <Cork> Patatouf: exactly
[01:46:58] <Cork> Patatouf: the server have to return jsonp
[01:47:21] <Cork> Patatouf: jsonp is a javascript file with a function returning the json
[01:47:37] <Cork> ?jsonp @ Patatouf
[01:47:37] <bot-t1> Patatouf, JSONP, Quickly Â« plaintext - http://niryariv.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/jsonp-quickly/ , What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/ - set the dataType for .ajax() to 'jsonp' if using .getJSON() see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/#jsonp
[01:48:42] <Patatouf> but there must be a way to catch what the url http://sc2ranks.com/api/base/teams/eu/Patatouf$223.json?appKey=github.com%2Fameerkat%2Fsc2ranks-php returns, doest it ?
[01:50:34] <Patatouf> maybe using the "contents" attribute of $.ajax ?
[01:56:52] <mrHat> is there any api function for checking if an array is empty ?
[01:57:16] <markj> ?eval [].length
[01:57:17] <bot-t1> markj: 0
[01:57:32] <mrHat> pfft nasty
[01:57:41] <markj> checking the length of an array is nasty?
[01:58:03] <markj> eval is the bot command if you think i was actually using eval
[01:58:11] <mrHat> will that work with multi-dimensional array ?
[01:58:38] <markj> you should try as i just quickly popped in :p
[01:58:39] <liquid-silence> does anyone have a plugin for jquery to do context menus?
[01:59:39] <Cork> mrHat: if the first array has an empty array in it, it isn't empty
[02:01:34] <makinen> why doesn't $("#feedback").focus() set the cursor visible?
[02:02:31] <schu> hi there. i am looking for the correct way to negate has() because i need something like $('.mydiv:hasnot(div))... - any help appreciated
[02:03:20] <Cork> Patatouf: no you can't
[02:03:27] <Cork> Patatouf: the browser will block your request
[02:03:43] <Cork> liquid-silence: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Menu
[02:03:48] <Patatouf> :(
[02:04:02] <Cork> Patatouf: its same origen limitations
[02:04:10] <makinen> oh, found out why. focus() just registers an event handler instead of giving focus ;)
[02:04:13] <Cork> it will block all scripting cross domains
[02:04:24] <Cork> makinen: no it doesn't
[02:04:46] <Cork> .focus(function() {}); binds an event .focus(); triggeres it
[02:04:51] <makinen> oh you're right
[02:05:30] <makinen> but it still doesn't focus on the text area
[02:06:45] <makinen> http://pastebin.com/PWvjLHfm
[02:07:45] <makinen> oh, there should be $("#feedback").focus() instead of click()
[02:08:05] <MoTiOnXml> i need some feedback on loading tabs for a ribbon i'm building
[02:08:07] <Cork> makinen: to start with <textarea /> isn't valid html though >_>

[02:08:18] <MoTiOnXml> ?
[02:08:24] <MoTiOnXml> just need to bounce a few ideas
[02:08:31] <Cork> makinen: should be <textarea></textarea>
[02:09:15] <makinen> thanks I fixed that
[02:10:23] <MoTiOnXml> im building a ribbon that loads tab sets upon certain events in the dom
[02:10:41] <MoTiOnXml> i.e. when an anchor is selected, i'm querying the server for a new tabset that matches that type etc.
[02:10:59] <w00t0ff> anyone seeing something wrong with this: http://jsfiddle.net/jw98c/
[02:11:04] <liquid-silence> Cork I want more a right click menu
[02:11:11] <MoTiOnXml> would the best approach be to return json objects from the server an parse that?
[02:11:51] <MoTiOnXml> i mean, if a json string-object contains a function, can you parse that to json and attach that function runtime?
[02:11:58] <makinen> Cork: any idea why $("#feedback").focus() isn't working?
[02:12:00] <MoTiOnXml> i.e. create function from a string?
[02:12:11] <liquid-silence> I have a treeview that I want to right click on a item
[02:14:39] <w00t0ff> guys any idea why $('#somediv').load('somefile.html'); won't work?
[02:14:49] <w00t0ff> files are on the same path
[02:15:19] <Puck`> w00t0ff: what does "not work" mean? You're not getting anything back?
[02:15:28] <w00t0ff> Puck`: yes
[02:16:03] <MoTiOnXml> can't a json stringified object contain methods?
[02:17:24] <Cork> liquid-silence: all you need to do is bind it to the contextmenu event
[02:17:42] <Cork> makinen: http://jsfiddle.net/L8pb7/embedded/result/
[02:17:44] <Cork> WFM
[02:17:56] <MoTiOnXml> can't a json stringified object contain methods?
[02:18:16] <MoTiOnXml> seems like the JSON.parse method discards it
[02:18:17] <Cork> makinen: validate your page, that will prob help
[02:18:53] <makinen> oh I forgot to mention that the html is inside colorbox
[02:19:18] <schu> w00t0ff: are you using firebug extension? maybe there is a server response that'll point you in the right direction...
[02:19:23] <makinen> it might be the reason for failing focusing
[02:19:45] <w00t0ff> schu: yes i am, i'll check it out thx

[02:28:11] <schu> w00t0ff: you can check out http://api.jquery.com/visual/ (in the search field enter "get") and try if the $.get() function suits your needs - my approach back then was to load from a local php file which gets data via readfile()
[02:28:42] <Ankabout> I want a hover on line 11 to affect line 17
[02:28:44] <w00t0ff> alright

[02:29:58] <Cork> w00t0ff: what is the type of data you want to handle?
[02:30:47] <Cork> w00t0ff: there is two days to do cross domain calls
[02:30:59] <Cork> one is iframes, and the other is the script tag
[02:31:07] <Cork> script tag is the only way if you want to get data back
[02:33:34] <pizou5639> how can i say in jquery else{ do nothing, or contnie excuting the page} ??
[02:33:53] <Cork> pizou5639: in what context?
[02:35:03] <pizou5639> it is not in the function, i have this weired problem, i am checking one condition at the head, if the condition is met it should redirect the page, else should do nothing,
[02:35:19] <pizou5639> but it goes to endless loop
[02:35:54] <Cork> ?p @ pizou5639
[02:35:54] <bot-t1> pizou5639, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/

[02:37:00] <pizou5639> http://pastebin.com/A7wSHZpR
[02:37:38] <pizou5639> if should put something in the else, like alert or something, otherwise it goes to endless loop, if so i dont put any else
[02:38:10] <Cork> window.location isn't a dom object
[02:38:32] <Cork> just do window.location = 'http://www.mysite.com/#/retreat/';
[02:39:09] <Cork> pizou5639: and no i don't think you need the else
[02:39:16] <pizou5639> ok, but that part works fine
[02:39:34] <DarsVaeda> hi, what can I do to remove a j-ui dialog after it is closed?
[02:39:34] <pizou5639> yes, exactly if i dont put else it goes to endless loop
[02:39:37] <Cork> it should, but is way overcomplicated for no reason
[02:39:53] <Cork> pizou5639: if that happens you haven't pasted enough code
[02:40:09] <Cork> you have to give enough code to tell the surcumstanses

[02:42:12] <jubberrue> Hi.  I have declared MyObj which have an instance variable (this.var1) and method (this.method1); this.method1 will alert(this.var1). Inside MyObj I used jQuery to bind an event $(".container").bind("mousemove", this.method1) . The method1 is called when the mousemove event is fired but the reference to this.var1 is lost. In fact I think the execution of method1 is not within the context of the MyObj.  Is there a way to execute method1 in
[02:44:13] <Cork> jubberrue: $(".container").bind("mousemove", function(event) { this.method1(event); }):
[02:44:18] <Cork> else you lose the relation
[02:44:36] <Cork> opps you need a carier var for this too
[02:44:46] <Cork> jubberrue: var self = this; $(".container").bind("mousemove", function(event) { self.method1(event); }):
[02:48:39] <pizou5639> Cork: this is the my whole code : http://pastebin.com/KwDDTAVY
[02:48:54] <liquid-silence> Cork there is a context menu evenT?
[02:49:15] <modles> hi guys
[02:49:28] <Cork> ?mdc contextmenu @ liquid-silence
[02:49:34] <bot-t1> liquid-silence, ContextMenus - MDC Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/xul/popupguide/contextmenus
[02:49:42] <Cork> noo...
[02:50:34] <modles> Im using jquery UI draggable code, and got an issue where Im targeting a child Li element on hover in the source list, not the target list. but when i drag an li from source to target the hover function is still acting when ive moved it to target. how can i prevent this?
[02:51:17] <Ankabout> can anyone help me with my selecting question?
[02:51:21] <liquid-silence> Cork html 5?
[02:51:31] <Ankabout> it's regarding this code: http://pastebin.com/Z9b7NdSY
[02:51:34] <Cork> liquid-silence: nope much older then that
[02:52:03] <liquid-silence> Cork I dont get what your saying
[02:52:36] <Ankabout> child?
[02:52:42] <Cork> liquid-silence: i had problem finding a ref page http://help.dottoro.com/ljhwjsss.php
[02:52:58] <modles> sorted it with a conditional statement checking parent id. no matter
[02:53:12] <Cork> liquid-silence: its a normal dom event, just show your menu from there and you have your contextmenu
[02:53:38] <toomuchinformati> (new question) I use the jQueryUI tooltip to transform title attributes -- example: $('.box').tooltip();
[02:53:40] <toomuchinformati> How do I remove it from descendent elements of .box?
[02:54:18] <toomuchinformati> something like  $('.box *').JustDoTheNormalThing;
[02:54:27] <toomuchinformati> do I need unbind()?
[02:54:34] <Cork> pizou5639: is the url the same you come from?
[02:54:44] <Cork> and do you really have the # in the url?
[02:55:33] <pizou5639> yeah, that;t my flash version of the site,
[02:55:54] <Cork> pizou5639: # isn't valid in urls, thats prob what causes your problem
[02:56:01] <jubberrue> Cork: thanks for the advice. I tried out $(".container").bind("mousemove", function(event) { this.method1(event); }): and get the error stating this.method1 is not a function.  The other one var self = this; $(".container").bind("mousemove", function(event) { self.method1(event); }): worked perfectly..  I'm thinking the issue was that the "this" keyword in the context of the jquery event is the ".container" not the MyObj instance.
[02:56:01] <pizou5639> i put "not" to the condition because my browser has flash
[02:56:25] <pizou5639> you know the redirection works fine cork
[02:56:41] <Cork> jubberrue: check the correction i put on the following line
[02:57:09] <Cork> pizou5639: you WILL get problem with an url like that
[02:57:13] <Cork> just so you know
[02:58:18] <pizou5639> Cork, hmmm well that is the flash gut problem not :) but i will inform them. just what the hell is wrong with else part??!!! :(
[02:59:01] <toomuchinformati> hi everyone -- I'm new here, what's the protocol for n00b questions?
[02:59:01] <Cork> pizou5639: what i try to figure out is why you would end up in a loop
[02:59:11] <jrockjiggz> ?ask @ toomuchinformati
[02:59:12] <bot-t1> toomuchinformati, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:59:13] <jubberrue> Cork: ok.. Thanks.
[02:59:25] <Cork> pizou5639: if you redirect to another url, there is nothing to cause a loop
[02:59:34] <toomuchinformati> is bot-t1 a bot?
[02:59:38] <jrockjiggz> toomuchinformati: bit of a dick comment ;)
[02:59:45] <jrockjiggz> toomuchinformati: yes, just a bot
[02:59:55] <toomuchinformati> ah, anyway, I did just ask ^^
[03:00:11] <toomuchinformati> but got no response, so just wondered how you do things around here
[03:00:19] <pizou5639> Cork, i want to just say if the browser has flash redirect to the flash version of the site,
[03:02:09] <Ankabout> what's the best way to undo a style change on hover when the mouse leaves the hover area?
[03:02:39] <jrockjiggz> toomuchinformati: your better off removing the children from your selection
[03:02:57] <toomuchinformati> so my .box selector is too broad?
[03:02:57] <jrockjiggz> $('.box').not( $(this).children() ).tooltip();
[03:03:02] <toomuchinformati> ah, excellent
[03:03:11] <toomuchinformati> that looks ideal
[03:03:45] <jrockjiggz> Ankabout: the best way is to addClass() and removeClass() ..
[03:04:02] <Ankabout> hmm ok...
[03:04:24] <Ankabout> that might work... lemme try
[03:04:42] <toomuchinformati> jrockjiggz: hmm, doesn't seem to work
[03:04:49] <Ankabout> right now I'm using attr.() and on leaving the hover, the elemnt that's changed doesn't react properly anymore, because the style's now inline
[03:05:06] <toomuchinformati> I have a descendent of .box with a title attribute, which is still getting the tooltip() treatment
[03:08:08] <jrockjiggz> toomuchinformati: $('.box:not(li)')
[03:08:27] <toomuchinformati> LI as in list item?
[03:08:59] <jrockjiggz> yea
[03:09:10] <jrockjiggz> i'm not sure why you dont want children
[03:09:37] <jrockjiggz> specific el type? empty el?
[03:09:42] <toomuchinformati> I only want to use the fancy tooltips on certain elements
[03:09:46] <toomuchinformati> not all their descendents
[03:10:13] <jrockjiggz> then $('.el1, .el2, .el3').tooltip()
[03:11:39] <Ankabout> thanks jrockjiggz, worked great
[03:12:12] <toomuchinformati> jrockjiggz: I'd get the tooltip on all the descendents of .el1, .el2, etc.
[03:12:25] <toomuchinformati> the thing with the tooltip happens to be quite high in the dom
[03:13:24] <toomuchinformati> isn't there an easy way to remove an event from elements?
[03:13:59] <toomuchinformati> $('.box *').removeEventsIDontWant();
[03:14:09] <toomuchinformati> or something?
[03:14:18] <toomuchinformati> I think unbind does that, but I couldn't get it to work
[03:14:21] <jrockjiggz> ?destroy
[03:14:22] <bot-t1> jrockjiggz, dialog( ”destroy” ) - Overview Options Events Methods Theming jQuery UI Dialog Overview A dialog is a floating window that contains a title bar and a content area. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with... http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Dialog/dialog
[03:15:17] <jrockjiggz> destroy is specific to jquery ui
[03:16:04] <jrockjiggz> $('.box').tooltip('destroy');
[03:17:09] <toomuchinformati> why doesn't this work: $('.box .icon').unbind();
[03:17:18] <toomuchinformati> (if I want to remove it from the descendent element .icon)
[03:19:51] <jrockjiggz> does $(.box).unbind() work?
[03:19:58] <toomuchinformati> oh, I guess unbind doesn't work because I didn't use bind in the first place?
[03:21:12] <toomuchinformati> well, yes, $(.box).unbind() following $(.box).tooltip() nullifies it
[03:21:40] <guy> Any idea why including 1.6.1 jquery keeps prompting Syntax error
[03:21:42] <guy> <!DOCTYPE html>
[03:22:37] <toomuchinformati> but $(.box *).unbind() doesn't work on descendents
[03:23:02] <jrockjiggz> you can also consider .undelegate
[03:23:39] <toomuchinformati> $('.box*').undelegate(); didn't work
[03:23:40] <jrockjiggz> the event that gets bind to the element is probably hover
[03:24:02] <jrockjiggz> an event is one of: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[03:24:28] <jrockjiggz> when you apply the plugin, it will bind an event to the element
[03:24:35] <pizou5639> Cork: no matter what is my condition it goes to endless loop: if ( 1 > 2 ){ window.location = 'http://www.google.com/'}
[03:24:47] <toomuchinformati> $('.box *').unbind('hover'); doesn't work either
[03:25:23] <jrockjiggz> $('.box > *')
[03:25:42] <jrockjiggz> i'm not sure how jqueryUi does it
[03:26:32] <toomuchinformati> shouldn't need the >
[03:26:38] <toomuchinformati> that's only for first-level descendents
[03:27:32] <toomuchinformati> this is the tooltip() I'm using btw:

[03:28:45] <pi3r> hi all
[03:28:53] <pi3r> i have a little question about javascript oop
[03:29:39] <pi3r> i've made a reusable class in order to use 2 slider (http://bxslider.com/) on my homepage
[03:30:16] <pi3r> the code is here https://gist.github.com/1031185
[03:31:24] <pi3r> the error is that when i try to the slide() method, i have this error Uncaught ReferenceError: activate_pager is not defined line 13
[03:31:43] <pi3r> and i don't get why
[03:32:06] <jrockjiggz> toomuchinformati: you can also $(".el").tooltip.block
[03:32:34] <toomuchinformati> what does block do there?
[03:35:48] <jrockjiggz> toomuchinformati: i found block will disable tooltip functionality, see demo here http://jquery.bassistance.de/tooltip/demo/
[03:36:01] <jrockjiggz> but in that demo it is for the whole page
[03:39:33] <toomuchinformati> based on that example, I did $('.box *').hover($.tooltip.block);
[03:39:37] <toomuchinformati> but it didn't work
[03:40:16] <toomuchinformati> nor did $('.box *').tooltip.block;
[04:02:39] <Kyotoweb> Hi
[04:06:35] <liquid-silence> Cork you here
[04:06:51] <Cork> sup
[04:07:00] <liquid-silence> may I pm for a second?
[04:07:11] <Cork> whats it about?
[04:07:29] <Cork> aka, why can't you take it here?
[04:07:32] <liquid-silence> that menu issue
[04:07:51] <liquid-silence> ok anyway I have the oncontextmenu="menu();"
[04:08:01] <ravenzz> menu issue goes in pm
[04:08:10] <ravenzz> +s
[04:08:22] <Cork> $('selector').bind('contextmenu', function() {}); please :)
[04:08:24] <liquid-silence> that should bring the menu function which is function menu() { $(".context").menu(); }
[04:09:11] <Cork> liquid-silence: anyway whats the question?
[04:09:56] <liquid-silence> $('a').bind('oncontextmenu', function() {
[04:09:56] <liquid-silence> 	alert("test");
[04:10:00] <liquid-silence> does not seem to do anything
[04:10:04] <liquid-silence> no alert
[04:10:19] <Cork> where do you have this alert?
[04:11:17] <ravenzz> i think that there is no built-in oncontextmenu event handler in jQuery
[04:11:33] <ravenzz> i am wrong?
[04:11:52] <liquid-silence> sorry wrong code :P
[04:11:55] <liquid-silence> its contextmenu
[04:12:12] <liquid-silence> \http://pastie.org/2082103
[04:12:16] <liquid-silence> the menu never comes up
[04:12:29] <Ankabout> ]/join #macosx
[04:12:30] <ravenzz> look at your console
[04:12:42] <ravenzz> what it's saying?
[04:13:21] <hmbg> this is annoying, in $(window).load() I perform some DOM stuff, but the images are still not loaded completely
[04:13:28] <jad> w errrrrrr
[04:13:33] <hmbg> I thought that was the point of .load
[04:13:36] <jad> ktir ktar ya bachar:P
[04:13:43] <Cork> liquid-silence: here, all you need to do is make sure you trigger the menu http://jsfiddle.net/bcYZ4/
[04:13:44] <jad> what was the point of .toj?
[04:14:09] <spam> I support Open Source
[04:14:26] <djQuery> great now we got open source spam
[04:14:39] <liquid-silence> yes the menu isu the issue
[04:15:23] <imanc> how can I add .datepicker to a delegate ?
[04:15:25] <Cork> liquid-silence: does the menu work if you call it statically?
[04:15:49] <imanc> $('body').delegate('.mydatefield', 'datepicker') ?
[04:16:23] <djQuery> ?ui.position

[04:16:51] <liquid-silence> Cork no
[04:17:00] <liquid-silence> but firebug is not complaining
[04:17:15] <Cork> liquid-silence: do you have jqueyr-ui loaded?
[04:17:21] <Cork> *jquery
[04:17:28] <liquid-silence>    <script src="/javascripts/jquery-ui-1.8.13.custom.min.js?1308183838" type="text/javascript"></script>
[04:17:48] <liquid-silence> hmm dont have the stylesheet though
[04:19:24] <liquid-silence> Ok Cork it works statically
[04:20:18] <Cork> liquid-silence: then it should work in the event too
[04:20:57] <liquid-silence> hmmm
[04:21:01] <Cork> make sure you don't bind the event in another event or something like that
[04:21:39] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/bcYZ4/1/
[04:21:48] <liquid-silence> Cork it make it a menu
[04:21:54] <liquid-silence> but its not where I wanted it to be
[04:21:59] <liquid-silence> its not bound to the li
[04:21:59] <djQuery> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/bcYZ4/1/
[04:22:09] <djQuery> liquid-silence: ^^^^
[04:22:17] <Cork> liquid-silence: ah, you need to position the menu ya
[04:22:35] <djQuery> liquid-silence: see ?ui.position

[04:42:03] <djQuery> var x = $('div').load('url', function(){  x.find('ul').sortable();  })
[04:42:10] <djQuery> mattems: ^^^^^^
[04:43:24] <mattems> djQuery: the list is already populated on page load and is sortable, but when i add a new item, the new item will not participate
[04:43:42] <djQuery> mattems: then call sortable on it again
[04:44:20] <mattems> yes but what about the sortable options i have
[04:44:45] <mattems> i have an update option which gets called on position change
[04:44:53] <binarious> Hi is it possible to fill a form with an array?

[04:46:20] <djQuery> mattems:   $('ul').apped($('<li></li>', {text: 'this is a test'})).sortable('refresh');
[04:46:37] <mattems> djQuery: will paste my code

[04:48:49] <binarious> gnarf: The method should detect if it's a Combobox or checkbox. But I found a Plugin "deserialize"http://plugins.jquery.com/project/deserialize
[04:49:28] <gnarf> donssp: not even sure i know what you're talking about
[04:49:46] <djQuery> mattems: hmmm when I add new li's the ul is still sortable even the new items. http://jsfiddle.net/EqvFB/
[04:50:01] <djQuery> notice the refresh button doesnt do anything yet
[04:50:38] <mattems> hmm
[04:52:17] <Tallisman> hi guys :)
[04:52:31] <djQuery> donssp: see ?validation
[04:52:32] <bot-t1> donssp, Plugins/Validation - "But doesn't jQuery make it so very easy to write your own validation plugin?" Sure, but there still are a lot of subtleties that you have to worry about: You need a standard library of validation ... http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation

[04:52:54] <imanc> how canI test if a div is empty?
[04:53:16] <catcatcat> Cork: you know your flash player code you gave me it does not work on IE
[04:53:21] <djQuery> $('div').html().length
[04:53:52] <djQuery> imanc: ^^^^^
[04:54:16] <imanc> djQuery: cool - thanks man

[04:54:44] <imanc> if( div not empty )
[04:55:22] <djQuery> imanc: there are several issues testing if it is empty if the opening and closing tags are not in the same line as well.
[04:55:39] <djQuery> imanc: :not(:empty)
[04:55:58] <imanc> djQuery: also trimming white space
[04:57:58] <donssp> gnarf:the div.mensagem are shown and hidden by the event click in $('#envia').click(function(event). I would like to do two simple functions, one to show and one to hide the div.mensagem, so i can to use in $('#envia').click(function(event), and in a blur event textbox, if is filled correctly hide the div.mensagem , else show it.
[04:58:09] <catcatcat> does anybody know why this code does not work on bloody IE? http://pastebin.com/WZPKMFKP

[05:01:36] <markj> catcatcat what exactly are you trying to do
[05:02:29] <catcatcat> i am trying to get browser flasg plugin version, it works fine everwhere except IE
[05:02:37] <Dp-supreme1> can someone just test it on INTERNET EXPLORER 9 this code:  http://jsfiddle.net/v2RCx/ (taken from  http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/toggle) it works on the jquery page but not in jsfiddle and not on iis... works fine for all other browser (safari, opera,chrome, firefox, ie6 to ie8... tested)
[05:02:47] <markj> navigator.plugins doesnt seem to have any information like that in IE
[05:02:56] <markj> is only has a length property and a refresh method
[05:03:00] <markj> so that will never work
[05:03:46] <markj> unfortunately i dont know what to suggest
[05:04:02] <markj> i imagine the information is somewehre
[05:04:17] <catcatcat> markj: how do you mean somewhere? :)
[05:05:02] <markj> in an object that you can access, i just dont know where, firefox definitely uses navigator.plugins and i guess others do too
[05:05:20] <markj> not something i know a huge deal about tbh
[05:05:24] <ElGoorf> are there any known issues with using val() to get input from a tinymce textfield?
[05:07:07] <djQuery> ElGoorf: havent used it but if you look at the input that tiny is put against does it update the field as they edit?

[05:11:47] <imanc> I'm loading a html fragment via $.ajax and in the success function I need to retrieve the contents of a div that is in the fragment

[05:14:34] <djQuery> imanc: ('selector').load('url  #selectorforwhatuwant', {data: 'anvyvars'}, function(){  any thing u wann do on success});
[05:15:04] <djQuery> have you tried that?
[05:15:25] <imanc> I was using .load before, but moved to ajax for a bit more control
[05:16:07] <imanc> isn't the success function on .ajax the same as the function on .load?
[05:16:39] <djQuery> imanc: not sure if it is equiv to success or complete
[05:24:55] <Dp-supreme1> djQuery:here's the code:http://jsfiddle.net/9xGxN/ it works but here's what happen in iis(none)http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/718/immagine2z.gif/ --- this only with IE9 cause look at the second pic http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/204/immagine3b.gif/

What I am trying to do is find a way , that if people login from their own sites to my site, it keeps their URL in the address bar, and not show mine. I tried it with an iFrame, but doing a page refresh always places it back at the original login page. Is there other solutions?

[06:31:54] <Clorith> With the jquery tabs, is there a way to identify that you are on the last tab?
[06:33:19] <tiagoa> brothertuck: put the code in http://jsfiddle.net please
[06:33:55] <tiagoa> Clorith: same tip: put the code in http://jsfiddle.net
[06:35:30] <jetienne> q. is there a function to autogenerate a id ?
[06:36:52] <g0bl1n> is it necessary to .bind() after an .addClass() ?
[06:37:37] <jetienne> g0bl1n: ? no. bind and addClass are completely unrelated
[06:38:15] <g0bl1n> jetienne, I did a .toggleClass("class1 class2") and the css works fine but the behaviour doesn't
[06:38:47] <Clorith> tiagoa: I have no code, I was just checking if it was possible ;)
[06:38:48] <g0bl1n> jetienne, the .click() function keeps using the class1 element click
[06:39:15] <tiagoa> I think so
[06:39:42] <g0bl1n> jetienne, I mean $('td.class1').click() keeps being called, even if class2 is active now
[06:39:43] <tiagoa> you can use the url parameter
[06:41:23] <jetienne> g0bl1n: jQuery("td.class1").live('click', function(){ ablablabl }) will fix it
[06:41:38] <jetienne> g0bl1n: the selector of the moment you bind
[06:41:58] <g0bl1n> jetienne, thanks, will try that
[06:43:03] <g0bl1n> jetienne, awesome !!!!!
[06:43:04] <g0bl1n> workd

[06:45:01] <brothertuck> ok same question as above now with jsfiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/zsgU5/3/
[06:48:58] <nail_> brothertuck: that's not a valid selector
[06:50:01] <nail_> '#form57048622 input[name="Name"]' will do it
[06:52:04] <Whirl3d> Good morning all. In an unordered list (that I am using for jquery tabs), is there a problem with having my tab contents (<div> elements) follow each of their tabs (<li> elements) ? Is there a problem with having content in the middle of an unordered list or having an unordered list split up by content?
[06:52:27] <MoTiOnXml> is there a nice way to listen for click-events (using live()) in the dom EXCEPT for events occuring within a certain element?
[06:52:30] <brothertuck> thx a lot,
[06:53:01] <brothertuck> too obvious for my brain
[06:53:02] <MoTiOnXml> do i have to check if the element is a child of the excluding element?
[06:53:26] <z3yo> How to make a live() with autocomplete function ?
[06:55:09] <Whirl3d> MoTIOnXml, that's going to be the best way to handle it, I think. Unless there's a .liveExcept() function or an automatically unbind conditional function
[06:55:29] <MoTiOnXml> Whirl3d: i found this: http://blog.pengoworks.com/index.cfm/2008/9/24/Using-jQuery-to-determine-if-an-element-is-a-child-of-another-element
[06:55:41] <skapism> What reason could be that after I change my contentType in $.ajax to 'application/json: charset=utf-8", the ajax request doesn't work any more properly? (specifically, firebug classifies it as 'OPTIONS')
[06:57:35] <cn1209> Hello, I'm trying to see why I'm getting this error: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'live'
[06:57:40] <erichynds> MoTiOnXml: that's what $.contains is for
[06:57:56] <Whirl3d> where are all the big #jquery people today? Usually there's at least one expert on here? Maybe it's just  a slow day.
[06:58:07] <Whirl3d> Oh, wait, there's erichynds...
[06:59:12] <Whirl3d> erichynds, you were a great help the other day for me and I didn't get a chance to thank you. Sorry for being rude, but "thank you" now
[06:59:29] <erichynds> haha np! :)
[06:59:37] <erichynds> i didn't detect any rudeness
[07:01:38] <Whirl3d> so, just out of curiosity, does .live just bind the event to an element once or does it listen for the trigger event and keep a list of listeners for callback?
[07:02:33] <Whirl3d> in other words, can an element that meets the criteria for a .live binding opt out of the .live process?
[07:02:48] <erichynds> it binds the event to the document, and when the event fires, checks to see if any selectors bound with live() matches the element
[07:02:49] <erichynds> i think
[07:03:03] <geekbuntu> Whirl3d, i honestly though it was an event listener
[07:03:07] <geekbuntu> *thought
[07:03:18] <geekbuntu> that was 'bound' to the selector
[07:03:31] <geekbuntu> via an 'event'
[07:03:33] <Whirl3d> so, there's no way to opt out unless you change the thing that matches the selector
[07:03:34] <geekbuntu> 'laser'
[07:03:54] <geekbuntu> Whirl3d, yes, i think there is a cancel queue/event
[07:04:27] <Whirl3d> geekbuntu, but that would cancel for all elements. What if just one element wanted out?
[07:04:58] <geekbuntu> i'm damn near a virgin compared to erichynds - so i'm googling trying to remember what i read/saw - see if it could help you
[07:05:11] <erichynds> wouldn't be possible because there's a handler bound to that element
[07:05:19] <erichynds> unless you die() the event
[07:05:21] <geekbuntu> http://api.jquery.com/unbind
[07:05:27] <geekbuntu> this might work Whirl3d
[07:05:51] <geekbuntu> Whirl3d, in your callback - have a function that removes the binding to the live selector in question
[07:05:53] <geekbuntu> just an idea
[07:06:38] <Whirl3d> geekbuntu, but you if the event is "bound" and it looks at the selector, you'd have to change the .live selector or unbind the .live event, I think
[07:07:12] <tiagoa> I'm doing an ajax request each second. when the page is refreshed, the error message is showed. i think the refresh action happens when the ajax request is being made: http://jsfiddle.net/T8Sxc/
[07:07:13] <geekbuntu> Whirl3d, since this is hypothetical at best, i'd have to say you only unbind it when you need it
[07:07:44] <geekbuntu> Whirl3d, like, if 'something' happens - disable this trigger
[07:08:29] <skapism> so, anyone has any idea what I'm doing wrong? I'm trying to query a rabbitmq server from my browser, and I need the contentType to be json/application
[07:09:24] <Whirl3d> MoTiOnXml, so here's your solution: change your live selector to exclude a certain class of element. Then to keep it from reacting to the live event add that class to the element
[07:10:03] <Whirl3d> $("li").not(".excludeClass").live("click",handleclick);
[07:10:20] <bobbobbins> hey, im using dataTable but i can't seem to get it working right...here is my call: http://jsfiddle.net/LsTFx/1/
[07:10:26] <MoTiOnXml> i have jQuery report .contains is true for something that seems weird
[07:10:27] <Whirl3d> Then you can add/remove .excludeClass on each element and it will join/unjoin the .live event
[07:10:33] <MoTiOnXml> could that be because of malformed HTML?
[07:10:44] <MoTiOnXml> like a missing closing div?
[07:10:59] <bobbobbins> i can't get the form data from my form #search_list_form to pass to my php script, and I can't get the table to display...it always says 0 records
[07:11:02] <skapism> I'll paste the code somewhere
[07:11:48] <skapism> http://pastebin.com/6eKV96dY
[07:12:16] <skapism> any reason this wouldn't work? (the equivalent call in curl works)
[07:13:36] <tiagoa> skapism: what error returns?
[07:13:54] <bobbobbins> any help?
[07:13:54] <skapism> tiagoa: firebug shows it as 'OPTIONS' request

[07:14:29] <tiagoa> *shift+ctrl+j

[07:17:50] <systemfault> The day a website does that to me... It lose me as a customer.
[07:17:53] <skapism> http://pastebin.com/UaNQE4BH here are the request and answer headers
[07:18:19] <gym_jane> systemfault, this not for a website it is for a specific experience
[07:18:26] <gym_jane> goes with the theme
[07:18:47] <skapism> I'm a bit concerned about the Access-Control-Request-Method: POST
[07:19:04] <skapism> before I changed the contentType, it was a normal POST request
[07:19:18] <systemfault> gym_jane: AFAIK, as long as the iframe is on the same domain, is should be possible.

[07:44:32] <z3yo> How can I do something like this ?
[07:44:33] <systemfault> Or perhaps I don't understand your question properly.
[07:45:29] <z3yo> New elements will add in DOM and I wanna have an autocomplete function on this new elements
[07:45:53] <z3yo> Is there not a way to do it ?
[07:46:34] <daniel____> Hi there.
[07:47:28] <daniel____> Do anyone know if theres a way to determine an images real size after having set it to a new size?
[07:48:39] <z3yo> systemfault, auny ideas ?
[07:49:39] <systemfault> z3yo: I don't think so
[07:50:51] <innociv> How do I get the current path? ie www.domain.com/folder/
[07:51:01] <z3yo> systemfault, Can we do something like this with bind or delegate ?
[07:51:01] <innociv> https://github.com/allmarkedup/jQuery-URL-Parser/blob/master/README.md doesn't seem that this even really does that..
[07:51:49] <innociv> ah it does actually
[07:52:16] <systemfault> z3yo: delegate is essentially the same idea as live so I don't think it would work.
[07:52:23] <dnlmzw> Do anyone know if theres a way to determine an images real size after having set it to a new size?
[07:52:46] <systemfault> z3yo: .bind would but... you won't know when the elements are added to the dom so you won't know WHEN to bind them
[07:55:48] <tiagoa> skapism: no.. your problem is with rabbitmq and I don't have ideia how it works
[07:58:20] <Mo> heya everybody
[08:01:50] <z3yo> systemfault, Is there a way to copy an event handler ?
[08:02:12] <systemfault> To copy?
[08:02:22] <systemfault> Just use the same function?
[08:02:27] <Guest43011> just a question, does IE support .css background changes?
[08:02:28] <systemfault> Not sure I get the question.
[08:02:42] <Guest43011> through jquery i mean
[08:02:51] <rz> is there any mailing list where i could announce a new jquery related project? (like python-announce for python, pgsql-announce for postgresql, etc)
[08:04:06] <Guest43011> since i have the following in a script $('#fullscreenbg').css('background-image','url("img/' + img + '.jpg")'); which runs in every browser except IE
[08:07:51] <Guest43011> ok i guess nobody has come across the same problem
[08:11:14] <skapism> tiagoa: I don't think the problem is with rabbitmq. even if I try to post the data to google, firebug marks it as OPTIONS
[08:13:24] <Ezra_> Hey can anyone help my understand the jquery.support checked properties?
[08:13:31] <Ezra_> me*
[08:14:42] <mjsilva_home> djQuery u there?
[08:15:16] <momito> Is there anyone else that has had problems using .css in Internet explorer?
[08:17:32] <Ezra_> Anyways, if anyone can answer this question, I'd much appreciated it: What is the difference between jquery.support.checkClone and jquery.support.noCloneChecked? For IE, checkClone is true whereas noCloneChecked is false. This is making it a pain to modify some cloned input elements. Does anyone have any insight?
[08:18:48] <Xano> Is it possible to write a selector that applied only to elements that have a child element with a certain id?
[08:18:53] <Xano> *applies
[08:20:14] <Ezra_> I dunno exactly, but if you don't get a better answer, you can always use .filter()
[08:20:20] <grey> you could always do $("#childID").parent() ?
[08:20:20] <RikudoSennin> hey guys, I have a series of 10 100x100 images and a 500x500 area, I want to absolute position the images, and position them RANDOMALLY across the field, where pictures will have no more then 10px overlapping over each other
[08:20:26] <RikudoSennin> is it doable?
[08:20:57] <ajpiano> RikudoSennin http://isotope.metafizzy.co/
[08:21:18] <grey> ajpiano: damn, you had that pretty quick @_@
[08:22:22] <ryanneufeld> RikudoSennin: if you don't want to pay for isotope you can use masonry
[08:22:24] <RikudoSennin> ajpiano, oh my god
[08:22:29] <RikudoSennin> that's like he read my mind
[08:22:50] <RikudoSennin> hmmmm
[08:22:53] <RikudoSennin> on second thought,
[08:22:58] <RikudoSennin> it's not exactly what I want :D
[08:23:17] <RikudoSennin> I want an image gallery, that would look like pictures casted randomally on a table
[08:23:28] <ryanneufeld> RikudoSennin: you basically want a 'pile' of pictures organized organically
[08:23:32] <RikudoSennin> each will have a random rotation value
[08:23:42] <RikudoSennin> and I want them positioned randomally
[08:24:01] <RikudoSennin> that alone is nice, but the problem is they might overlap and hide each other
[08:28:10] <g0bl1n> "Resource interpreted as Document but transferred with MIME type text/javascript."
[08:28:47] <g0bl1n> I'm getting a JSON response to parse inside jquery function. In 1.4.3 worked fine. In 1.6.1 doesn't
[08:29:26] <ryanneufeld> ?p @g0bl1n
[08:29:26] <bot-t> g0bl1n, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[08:30:00] <ch3mi0n> Morning
[08:31:49] <Xano> grey: thanks!
[08:34:33] <miketaylr_> wats a jquery
[08:35:16] <tbranyen> miketaylr_: a misguided neophyte driven dom library written by bufoons
[08:35:30] <miketaylr_> D:
[08:37:42] <adac> stupid beginner question: Is it possible to supervise a class for changes (ie: a class of radio buttons)? If yes how? this is for id: $("#id").change(function().. , right?
[08:38:21] <Brodingo> instead of #id use .class
[08:38:27] <miketaylr_> adac: yeah, the change event works on form elements $('.radiodudes').change()
[08:38:30] <g0bl1n> any link that I can use to test, that returns a JSON blob ?
[08:38:48] <Brodingo> i think jsfiddle has that
[08:39:20] <Brodingo> yeah check the links on the side where it says testing ajax requests
[08:39:31] <miketaylr_> g0bl1n: http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=cheeseburgers
[08:39:41] <g0bl1n> oh, thanks ;-)
[08:40:00] <adac> miketaylr, cool thing! thank you!
[08:40:04] <miketaylr_> np
[08:45:45] <adac> miketaylr, would this work with disabling a bunch of radiopn buttons as well (referreing to the class instead of every single radio button id)
[08:45:46] <dnlmzw> Is there a way to get 2 images to lay over each other without the use of position?
[08:46:28] <miketaylr> adac: yeah so like $('.foo').attr('disabled') or however its done
[08:47:00] <miketaylr> or .prop('disabled', true)? i dunno, my jquery is out of date
[08:47:15] <nail_> dnlmzw: margins
[08:47:31] <tbranyen> miketaylr_: that stuff kind of confuses me
[08:47:38] <tbranyen> since i only ever use jquery with dom nodes
[08:47:43] <tbranyen> i guess i stick with attr
[08:48:26] <miketaylr_> cool, so $('.foo').attr('disabled', 'disabled') to disable and remoteAttr('disabled') to reenable i guess adac
[08:49:06] <adac> miketaylr, $(".evolution-strategy").attr('disabled',true); seems to work
[08:49:12] <ryanneufeld> .seen temp01
[08:49:12] <hsbot> temp01 was seen 2 hours, 8 minutes and 26 seconds ago, joining #html5
[08:49:18] <miketaylr> adac: yeah, i guess that works too :)
[08:49:55] <adac> miketaylr, now I need to figure out how to check if a radio button is selected...well better how to ask if it is checked
[08:49:56] <adac> :)
[08:51:16] <miketaylr_> hmm, i think you can do .is(':checked') or something
[08:51:27] <miketaylr_> or just check the checked attribute
[08:51:37] <dnlmzw> nail_: thanks. but didnt apply here unfortunatly. but you made me look at the problem from a different angle! ;)
[08:54:43] <adac> miketaylr, yeah should be somthing like that. Just wondering if i need an if statemnet.... guess so
[08:55:16] <miketaylr> if ($(foo).is(checked)){ doSomething()}
[08:55:39] <adac> miketaylr, thank you again!
[08:55:56] <miketaylr> np dude
[08:56:24] <g0bl1n> so, I'm getting JSON response and according to a Chrome json parser, it is well formed. Passed in 1.4.3 as sucess but fails in 1.6.1 as error, on the ajax call
[08:57:07] <g0bl1n> I have datatype: 'json'
[08:57:13] <g0bl1n> on the ajax call
[09:12:43] <LionKMP> Hi, I am finding a plugin, but cannot really explain to search engines. A side panel would be shown, fixed position, with some text like "get support" on the left side of the page. When mouse is moved over, it would open, show some HTML content.
[09:15:39] <LionKMP> hm... this is so simple, it probably does not need any plugin. :-) I'll try to implement.
[09:16:07] <necromancer> LionKMP: oh like that "feedback" box on the side of some web pages?
[09:16:27] <LionKMP> yes, exactly
[09:16:55] <necromancer> LionKMP: i think that's provided by getsatisfaction.com
[09:17:18] <necromancer> you could easily implement it yourself with 2 divs, CSS position:fixed and jQuery
[09:17:24] <necromancer> or you could just sign up there
[09:17:27] <necromancer> pretty sure it's a widget
[09:17:36] <necromancer> beta.beatport.com has one that points to uservoice.com though, so check that out too
[09:18:07] <LionKMP> ok, I'll try to implement it first, because I just want to show some very simple HTML content. So probably does not need anything special :)
[09:18:24] <LionKMP> thank you
[09:23:49] <KWhat_Work> is it possible to create, destroy and recreate a widget or is that a no-no.
[09:24:32] <Fernandos> "widget"?
[09:24:58] <KWhat_Work> obj.button(), obj.button('destroy') then obj.button() again
[09:25:06] <Fernandos> ah
[09:34:57] <ch3mi0n> KWhat_Work: If you mean create the same object again with all of it's bindings, etc, you might just want to see ?.remove
[09:34:57] <bot-t> KWhat_Work, .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[09:35:33] <ch3mi0n> Then you just reattach the object to the dom. see ?appendTo
[09:35:33] <bot-t> .appendTo(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target. http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[09:36:49] <ch3mi0n> If you destroy it, you have to create a new object (not "recreate" the same one)
[09:36:58] <ch3mi0n> Which means you lost any bindings
[09:37:54] <g0bl1n> so how can one force an ajax call to accept a uri://server/resp.js JSON object without getting a  "Resource interpreted as Document but transferred with MIME type text/javascript" ?
[09:38:24] <ch3mi0n> Use JSONP
[09:38:37] <innociv> If you have really large object in a function, ie  makeLargeObject = function(){ var largeObj = { a lot of stuff }; return largeObj; }  Is the return largeObj; actually adding any overhead when you do makeLargeObject(); rather than returnedLargeObj = makeLargeObject(); ?
[09:40:22] <systemfault> g0bl1n: Why is your file having .js as extension?
[09:40:28] <systemfault> And not... .json?
[09:40:45] <g0bl1n> systemfault, because the framework returns a json when the request is with a .js extension
[09:40:48] <hron85> Hi! I have a small problem. I have a text field with default value, and if i call .val() on it, i always got the default value, not the typed value. Is this a bug, or i do something wrong?
[09:40:57] <g0bl1n> oh, json will work too
[09:41:02] <g0bl1n> let me try
[09:41:13] <g0bl1n> systemfault, with a .json jquery will make it pass ?
[09:41:30] <systemfault> g0bl1n: It should.
[09:41:32] <KWhat_Work> ch3mi0n: dont want to remove the element from the dom, just want to remove what the widget applied
[09:41:51] <g0bl1n> systemfault, that was introduced in 1.5, right ?
[09:42:15] <systemfault> g0bl1n: What? That's just a file extension :/
[09:42:16] <ch3mi0n> KWhat_Work: .button("destroy") should be fine then
[09:42:55] <g0bl1n> systemfault, enforcing dataTypes
[09:43:18] <systemfault> Not sure.
[09:43:28] <systemfault> I haven't used jQuery for a long time
[09:44:50] <warpdesign42> hell
[09:44:54] <warpdesign42> hello
[09:45:34] <warpdesign42> I'm having a problem with a jsonp ajax call... the server returns a 403 error (with xml data instead of jsonp) and it seems jQuery doesn't call the success nor the error callback
[09:45:40] <g0bl1n> systemfault, requesting a .json I get the same "Resource interpreted as Document but transferred with MIME type application/json." in the javascript console
[09:46:19] <systemfault> Is the content of the file, really json?
[09:46:22] <g0bl1n> systemfault, in the browser I get the json blob ok. The chrome json parser parses it well
[09:46:29] <systemfault> Ok
[09:47:43] <necromancer> warpdesign42: are you serving your content as JSON on the server side?
[09:48:20] * Fernandos heh.. I wonder what jQuery 2.0 brings.. it probably comes with a flux compensator :P
[09:48:31] <necromancer> warpdesign42: it sorta sounds like you're trying to request JSONP but your script is serving XML
[09:50:47] <necromancer> anyone here use jQuery with coffeescript?
[09:52:17] <janthony> I made a jquery/ajax based navigation site, but something I didn't think about is how that would affect Google Analytics. Does anyone have any suggestions to Google Analytics to work with my ajax nav so when a new page is loaded via ajax, Google will recognize that?
[09:54:04] <warpdesign42> necromancer: indeed, this is the case
[09:54:06] <janthony> http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/asyncMigrationExamples.html - May be what I need
[09:54:12] <warpdesign42> the problem is that I don't have control over it
[09:54:28] <necromancer> warpdesign42: well i guess you can't request jsonp from that endpoint then :)
[09:54:34] <warpdesign42> this is the youtube graph api, that returns an xml error with status 403 when the video can't be accessed...
[09:54:41] <necromancer> oh
[09:54:48] <g0bl1n> necromancer, if a browser json parser can parse it, then it is being served as JSON, right ?
[09:54:48] <necromancer> well you never said that :)
[09:55:08] <warpdesign42> well, it only returns xml when the video cannot be accessed... otherwise it returns jsonp, as requested
[09:55:09] <necromancer> g0bl1n: nope. there are special headers for serving JSON so there's no question as to the content type
[09:55:25] <necromancer> g0bl1n: however, JSON is really just a String so not having those headers in place may still work
[09:55:33] <necromancer> warpdesign42: oh that sucks..
[09:55:44] * necromancer slaps youtube on the wrist
[09:55:46] <necromancer> bad developer. bad.
[09:55:51] <warpdesign42> necromancer, yeah, it sucks
[09:56:01] <g0bl1n> necromancer, so my warning is even more weird: "Resource interpreted as Document but transferred with MIME type application/json."
[09:56:19] <d4rklit3> is jquery with 800+ people owning my irc client?
[09:58:17] <necromancer> d4rklit3: maybe. what client do you have?
[09:58:30] <necromancer> d4rklit3: what's your OS?
[09:58:38] <d4rklit3> pidgin
[09:58:41] <d4rklit3> win 7
[09:58:46] <d4rklit3> eats one whole core
[09:59:48] <necromancer> haha
[09:59:50] <necromancer> why?
[10:00:00] <necromancer> use mIRC
[10:00:05] <necromancer> much lighter
[10:01:01] <g0bl1n> necromancer, all the headers are ok. Chrome parsers parses it ok. Firefox asks to save the json blob. JQuery reports an error
[10:01:40] <necromancer> g0bl1n: strange. firefox is popping up the "save file" dialog?
[10:01:57] <necromancer> and does jQuery report an error regardless of browser?
[10:01:59] <g0bl1n> necromancer, yes
[10:02:12] <d4rklit3> necromancer: i use pidgin for bonjour and gtalk too
[10:02:16] <d4rklit3> its better than trillian
[10:02:19] <d4rklit3> MUCH better
[10:02:21] <g0bl1n> necromancer, yes, firefox pops the save dialog
[10:02:26] <necromancer> d4rklit3: it sucks for IRC though
[10:02:44] <necromancer> i use Adium on mac and i used to use pidgin when it was called Gaim and the IRC has always sucked balls
[10:03:51] <necromancer> g0bl1n: do you control your server config? that happens to me when the webserver doesn't understand the file type
[10:03:54] <janthony> With google analytics and ajax navigation, do I need to add the google analytics code at the bottom of the pages being loaded via ajax, or can I just have it loaded on my index.php and some how google recognize that a new link has been clicked/loaded via ajax?
[10:04:03] <necromancer> like if i try to go to a php page without mod_php being enabled on the servrer
[10:04:05] <necromancer> server*
[10:05:00] <K1ng> <label onclick="paymethod('DD');" for="DD" aria-pressed="false" class="ui-button ui-widget ui-state-default ui-button-text-only" role="button" aria-disabled="false"><span class="ui-button-text" onclick="paymethod('DD');">Direct Debit</span></label>
[10:05:10] <K1ng> :(
[10:05:36] <necromancer> K1ng: that code sucks change it
[10:05:40] <K1ng> label's onclick doesnt work :(
[10:05:44] <necromancer> CHANGE IT
[10:05:46] <necromancer> CHANGE.
[10:05:47] <necromancer> IT.
[10:05:47] <necromancer> ;)
[10:05:51] <g0bl1n> necromancer, It worked fine with 1.4.3. Now with 1.6.1, the ajax result fails
[10:06:18] <ravenzz> ?click @K1ng
[10:06:18] <bot-t> K1ng, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[10:06:34] <K1ng> yeah i know
[10:06:49] <ravenzz> then use that
[10:06:53] <janthony> Anyone?
[10:06:56] <ravenzz> or ask on #javascript
[10:06:57] <ravenzz> :?
[10:07:05] <K1ng> but <span class="ui-button-text">Direct Debit</span> is genrated by jquery ui :(
[10:07:11] <necromancer> g0bl1n: really? that's interesting. there has been significant changes to $.ajax since 1.4.x
[10:07:20] <necromancer> but we've never had a problem with it
[10:07:20] <K1ng> fine
[10:07:33] <KWhat_Work> ch3mi0n: so when i use destroy and then recreate my widget only _init gets called.  For some resason _create does not get called again
[10:07:38] <alexidoia> hi there
[10:08:03] <alexidoia> to target an anchor inside a div which I know this id, is it possible or should I add an id to the anchor ?
[10:08:05] <necromancer> K1ng: you're not gonna have much luck if you just paste a line of code and say "click doesn't work fix it"
[10:08:16] <g0bl1n> necromancer, updated today to 1.6.1 so only noticed today :-)
[10:08:23] <ch3mi0n> KWhat_Work: Not sure on that one
[10:08:28] <necromancer> K1ng: might i suggest gisting a snippet of your JS code that deals with that function?
[10:08:47] <ngharo> K1ng: when you create the button you can define the click function to go with it
[10:09:03] <necromancer> g0bl1n: what if you update to this http://blog.jquery.com/2011/06/14/jquery-162rc1-released/
[10:09:33] <necromancer> g0bl1n: might have been a bug that got fixed
[10:09:49] <g0bl1n> necromancer, oh, let me try
[10:09:50] <necromancer> just make sure you test the rest of your site to make sure nothing else broke
[10:10:06] <g0bl1n> necromancer, yes... #phear :-)
[10:10:40] <janthony> If I want to track google analytics with my ajax nav, would I put this on the click event? _gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/some-page']);
[10:11:16] <janthony> I'm not sure if it goes inside the click event or if it goes inside the existing google analytics script code.
[10:11:31] <ngharo> sounds like it'd go in your click handler
[10:11:36] <g0bl1n> my json blob: http://www.pastie.org/2083577
[10:12:12] <necromancer> janthony: give it a shot and see if it works. you can always just put <script> tags at the bottom of every HTML page/snippet you create
[10:12:16] <markj> ?g using google analytics with ajax @ janthony
[10:12:16] <necromancer> with that in there
[10:12:17] <bot-t> janthony, Track AJAX Link Clicks Using Google Analytics - http://davidwalsh.name/ajax-analytics
[10:12:20] <janthony> ngharo: yeah, that's what I would figure as well but didn't know if that itself would break cus _gaq is defined in the google analytics script code, not my click()
[10:12:20] <necromancer> oh there ya go
[10:12:21] <necromancer> :)
[10:12:26] * necromancer has never had to track ajax links with GA
[10:13:14] <janthony> markj:  I'm already at that page. However, none of these references tell you where to put "_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/some-page']);"
[10:13:21] <K1ng> how do i get value of selected radio?
[10:13:25] <warpdesign42> necromancer: any idea of what I could do to catch the failure ?
[10:13:30] <ejo> Hey, I'm having trouble with jquery-ui's autocomplete in "multiple values remote datasource" mode.  It works fine in single value remote data mode.  But using the demo source from http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#multiple-remote, I'm just getting a thin grey box that's too thin to see my results.
[10:13:33] <markj> oh right sorry
[10:13:36] <janthony> markj: If you look at that article, the last comment is a guy asking the same question as I am.
[10:13:39] <picasso> what's the best way to simulate a mouse click in a browser, in a way that is not easily detectable as computer-generated ?
[10:13:40] <markj> yeah it should no doubt be within the click
[10:14:01] <markj> you no doubt have an ajax function to load the content, maybe do it in the complete callback
[10:14:08] <markj> because then you know the content actually loaded
[10:14:18] <necromancer> warpdesign42: are you getting javascript errors with that 403/XML response?
[10:14:20] <ngharo> ?selected @ K1ng

[10:25:31] <markj> DynamicFail i dont have much experience with sites that do things like that, but id probably still recommend the same order
[10:25:41] <markj> i guess its the server side language that would be important in executing scripts etc

[10:28:46] <necromancer> also if you use getJSON remember that it's jsonp, so you'll need to build the JSON around a callback, which is given to you in the GET param 'callback'. just surround your JSON with the callback and parenthesis
[10:28:57] <fubhy> markj, yes I am binding that event in a different file
[10:29:32] <g0bl1n> necromancer, "as a result, my success handler is never fired" is my case, thanks ;-)
[10:29:43] <fubhy> markj, triggering the event for single elements like $(document).trigger('layoutswitch') works well
[10:29:51] <fubhy> but not with the global trigger $.event.trigger
[10:30:08] <fubhy> and not with $('*').trigger either
[10:30:14] <fubhy> (which calls the global trigger)

[10:36:22] <hron85> can i call getElementsByTagName on jquery element somehow?
[10:36:37] <ravenzz> you don't need that
[10:36:39] <ravenzz> :|
[10:36:58] <ravenzz> you should use find()
[10:37:41] <hron85> ravenzz: i tried, but it seems has a problem, and i would like see the root of problem is jquery or not.
[10:37:48] <ravenzz> or something related to your purpose
[10:38:02] <m0sphere> how would i do a... if $stringvar contains &nbsp then do whatever?
[10:38:27] <m0sphere> and if $stringvar contains more than 1 &nbsp do something else
[10:38:31] <ravenzz> hron85 if you would paste your code on jsfiddle.net i'll take a look
[10:38:58] <ravenzz> $stringvar is php :P
[10:39:26] <hron85> ravenzz: not, this is seems outer problem than my stuff. The main problem is i trying to fetch content of a text field, but jquery displays the default value (<input type=Â¨textÂ¨ value=Â¨somethingÂ¨/> ) instead of the typed value
[10:39:28] <odyniec> ravenzz: it might be JS :)
[10:39:43] <m0sphere> var $stringvar = $(this).html
[10:39:46] <m0sphere> that's php?
[10:40:30] <hron85> ravenzz: http://pastebin.com/ePXfAR7X
[10:40:35] <odyniec> m0sphere: if (stringvar.match(/&nbsp;.*&nbsp;/)) { do something else } else if (stringvar.match(/&nbsp;/)) { do something }
[10:40:44] <m0sphere> thanks i'll give that a try
[10:40:45] <hron85> the main problem is at line 14
[10:41:13] <odyniec> m0sphere: you can also try .indexOf
[10:41:51] <hron85> ravenzz: i cannot get the typed value
[10:42:13] <hron85> but the strangest thing, in firebug i see the textfield _have_ the typed value.
[10:42:35] <hron85> But the browser feeds my script with shit.
[10:43:46] <llynix> I have a javascript error in IE8.  Says 'undefined' is null or not an object.  Seems to happen when I click the X on the popup on this page:  http://buydentalequipment.com
[10:45:15] <m0sphere> odyniec: http://jsfiddle.net/T8FGv/1/ is what i'm tried but it doesn't seem to work
[10:45:36] <ravenzz> llynix http://buydentalequipment.com/:61Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'match' of undefined
[10:47:17] <odyniec> m0sphere: what's wrong with that? I added &nbsp; to that div and a border appeared
[10:48:09] <llynix> So I'm guessing document.domain is undefined for that X.  How would I make it so it didn't throw the error?  Something like $docdomain = (document.domain) : document.domain ? false;  I really don't know javascript very well :(
[10:48:39] <hron85> ravenzz: any idea?
[10:49:14] <m0sphere> hm, it works if you add the text &nbsp; but not if you add a space
[10:49:42] <odyniec> m0sphere: a space is not "&nbsp;"
[10:51:32] <ravenzz> hron85 indeed i so confused. i should see a live example, and be able to edit the code... you would paste your code (and a bit of html) on jsfiddle.net
[10:51:35] <m0sphere> am i tired or does adding &nbsp; create a space?
[10:52:06] <odyniec> m0sphere: on your screen, yes
[10:52:36] <odyniec> m0sphere: but that still "&nbsp;" in the html
[10:52:48] <hron85> ravenzz: can i send you a pm? I can send you a live access, this is a development site
[10:52:53] <m0sphere> okay.. how do i get jquery to realize there's a space in the string then?
[10:52:59] <ravenzz> oh ok
[10:53:51] <odyniec> m0sphere: if you replace the &nbsp;'s in the code piece that I gave you with spaces, it will work with spaces
[10:53:58] <m0sphere> oh
[10:54:01] <m0sphere> hah alright then
[10:56:33] <llynix> ravenzz: any idea how to fix it..  I tried defining document.domain but that didn't seem to work.  http://buydentalequipment.com
[10:59:48] <Gateway69> anyone help me out with some basic jquery.. im a bit of a newb to it.. so sorry if its easy..
[11:00:45] <Gateway69> I have a div that has the unity3d player in it, think flash player, I want to hide or resize it to 1x1 pixel on button click.. it needs to use the height param for js and visiability hidden param, other wise when its expanded it reloads the player again..
[11:01:01] <juha___> my request to indian coders: please don't code if you don't know how to code.
[11:01:35] <Gateway69> i have some sample code here http://www.pastie.org/private/igyh5ta9xfvcau6dlshgfq
[11:01:45] <K1ng> how do i select a label using class and id? $('#paylabel .ui-state-active').length; says 0 :(
[11:02:11] <K1ng> $('#paylabel').length; says 1
[11:02:51] <ajpiano> K1ng, no space.
[11:02:55] <ajpiano> $("#foo.bar");
[11:02:59] <ajpiano> space is descendant selector
[11:03:00] <K1ng> ah
[11:03:03] <K1ng> thanks :D
[11:03:17] <K1ng> awesome :D
[11:07:08] <odyniec> Gateway69: you have a click handler in there doing .animate, does it work?
[11:08:40] <Gateway69> i thought by having an id button it would do this
[11:09:09] <Gateway69> <button id="button"> Hide </button>  , of course this is demo code i found, ideally i would like to click on a button and resize an id to a 1x1 pixel
[11:09:45] <odyniec> Gateway69: with animation, or instantly?
[11:10:20] <Gateway69> at the vary basics to just get me started, i wanted to do a button, hide, which makes the id 1x1 pixel, and show which brings it back to width and height
[11:10:40] <llynix> der was href that was undefined.  Got it thanks all.
[11:11:09] <Gateway69> oy: sorry a newb here, trying to get the handle of jquery
[11:11:57] <odyniec> Gateway69: this should do it: $('#button').click(function () { $('.content').width(1).height(1); });
[11:12:32] <Gateway69> is .content a class or id
[11:12:53] <odyniec> Gateway69: a class, it's a CSS selector
[11:13:32] <GeoDud> has anyone ever seen a good example of auto-save functionality in a web app that lacks an explicit manual save button?
[11:13:35] <Gateway69> yea.. ok so i have that.. but when clicking on the button nothing happens.. and no error in chrome web dev
[11:14:16] <Fernandos> GeoDud: google docs have that "autosave", but they still offer a save button.
[11:14:17] <odyniec> Gateway69: you need to wrap that in a function called on DOM ready event
[11:14:39] <odyniec> Gateway69: $(function () { ... });
[11:14:46] <GeoDud> Fernandos: gotchya...similar to Evernote's web app
[11:14:58] <Gateway69> hmm, is their a jquery example page for this..
[11:15:03] <odyniec> Gateway69: replace "..." with the button click code
[11:17:08] <Gateway69> hmm, this is what im trying to work thought.. maybe bit off a bit more than i can chew this friday http://forum.jquery.com/topic/resize-div-id-to-1x1-pixel-when-in-a-different-tab
[11:24:32] <gopus> is it possible to start PHP Sessions without a page refresh?
[11:24:36] <gopus> like through AJAX?
[11:24:52] <gopus> *thinks*
[11:25:43] <gopus> nevermind, I figured it out
[11:27:41] <KWhat_Work> there a way to set a widgets options: {} ?
[11:27:43] <Snerf> looking for a way to send a refresh to an iframe.
[11:30:46] <KWhat_Work> Snerf: you try document.getElementById("iframeId").src = document.getElementById("iframeId").src
[11:31:19] <Snerf> sure, I will give it a try
[11:32:17] <elvis2> hi, i am new to jquery... how can i use the OR operator in a statement like $('.container-inline #edit-search-block-form-1') || $('.container-inline #edit-search-block-form-3';)
[11:32:37] <blindMoe> elvis2: what is your end goal?
[11:32:45] <blindMoe> just to see if either exist?
[11:33:11] <elvis2> nope, if either of those ids are found, then i do something
[11:33:30] <elvis2> like in php we write if( $x OR $y)
[11:33:54] <elvis2> what is the syntax in jquery? is it $('.container-inline #edit-search-block-form-1') + $('.container-inline #edit-search-block-form-1');
[11:34:17] <Haprog> I haven't done much in jQuery yet either, but I'd guess you first get the first element and then append the second in the same selection with some function
[11:35:10] <blindMoe> elvis2: http://jsfiddle.net/BtrMK/
[11:35:33] <elvis2> ha, it is the same
[11:35:35] <elvis2> thanks
[11:35:53] <Haprog> I thought you'd want to do something with both of the elements in jQuery
[11:36:07] <Haprog> chaining stuff afther selecting the elements
[11:38:31] <elvis2> Haprog: nope, just to check against them...
[11:38:35] <Haprog> ok
[11:38:46] <Snerf> KWhat_Work, doesnt work. it brings it back to the original source, not the current page I am at
[11:39:13] <elvis2> here is what i ended up Haprog and blindMoe http://pastebin.com/KsmTnNee
[11:40:04] <blindMoe> elvis2: that works
[11:40:20] <Haprog> I guess you could use .add() for the situation I described. $('#id1').add('#id2').dostuff()
[11:42:00] <slackz> Having trouble with the jQuery Tablesorter plugin (http://tablesorter.com/docs/). In my <td> I have a number, followed by a list of display:none computer names. I want to sort the table based on the number, but it's using all the data in the <td>. There a way around this using just Tablesorter or do I need to remove the extra data from the TD and just add it when the # is clicked to show that data?
[11:44:36] <FromCrimsonToWoo> I have a set of jQuery elements via CSS selectors and I'm new-ish to jQuery.  I need to compare the elements and just get the tallest element.  What would be the best way to do so?
[11:45:38] <FromCrimsonToWoo> Anyone?
[11:45:54] <ajpiano> what do you want to do to the tallest element?
[11:46:03] <FromCrimsonToWoo> I just need the height off of it.
[11:46:24] <FromCrimsonToWoo> The element itself isn't going to be changed.
[11:46:29] <Haprog> FromCrimsonToWoo: I guess you could use .each() with a function that compares elements with the last element and saves the tallest to a variable.
[11:47:01] <ajpiano> FromCrimsonToWoo
[11:47:05] <ajpiano> Math.max.apply(Math, $("elements").map(function() { return $(this).height(); }).get());
[11:47:06] <FromCrimsonToWoo> I've been trying that, but I haven't gotten anything working.  Would you mind providing an example?
[11:47:09] <ajpiano> that is the height of it ^^
[11:47:12] <ajpiano> i thought you needed the element
[11:47:26] <FromCrimsonToWoo> No worries.  Thank you.
[11:47:27] <swiggy> calling all jquery gods, bosses, and queens alike

[11:48:00] <swiggy> if i do alter(this.attr('href'));
[11:48:08] <swiggy> i get http://www.mysite.com/thispage
[11:48:16] <swiggy> when it should just be /thispage
[11:49:22] <shesek> swiggy, IIRC some other browsers does that doo
[11:49:42] <swiggy> <a href="/thispage/please/" id="1">click</a>          $('#1').click(function(){ alert($(this).attr('href'); });
[11:49:49] <swiggy> in all other browsers but IE6
[11:49:56] <swiggy> it returns /thispage/please
[11:49:59] <swiggy> but in Ie6
[11:50:07] <FromCrimsonToWoo> ajpiano: That seems to work well.  THANKS!  :-)
[11:50:08] <swiggy> it reutns www.mypage.com/thispage/please
[11:50:12] <Snerf> who in hell still uses IE6?
[11:50:22] <FromCrimsonToWoo> Snerf: :-D
[11:53:08] <smplstk> Snerf: sadly, a lot of people.
[11:53:21] <Snerf> smplstk, then screw em
[11:53:23] <swiggy> so whats the fix?
[11:53:30] <swiggy> yeah i dont know who the hell uses IE6
[11:53:34] <swiggy> but when you have a large website
[11:53:40] <swiggy> you need to make shit sure works with all browsers
[11:53:43] <Snerf> I have a large website, I dont even bother with IE7
[11:53:53] <swiggy> and my ajax calls are all breaking bc of this
[11:54:01] <swiggy> well thats your decision
[11:54:04] <swiggy> but i have paying customers
[11:54:09] <swiggy> who want to beable to view content
[11:54:09] <Snerf> I do to
[11:54:11] <swiggy> w/o upgrading
[11:54:21] <swiggy> if you ahve people over the age of 50
[11:54:25] <Snerf> and if they cant use a proper browser, its their problem
[11:54:29] <swiggy> they probably do not know how to. or want to upgrade
[11:54:42] <swiggy> not when they pay $1200/month for a service
[11:54:52] <swiggy> its more of my problem to make sure my site works globally
[11:55:00] <swiggy> and we have about 22% of our users on IE6
[11:55:03] <Snerf> wow, thats just crazy. I wouldnt put up with that crap
[11:55:07] <systemfault> swiggy: wtf?
[11:55:09] <systemfault> 22%
[11:55:34] <Snerf> 22% is insane
[11:55:47] <Snerf> what are they all running, windows 98?
[11:55:58] <swiggy> 12% on IE6, 33% on Chrome, 15% on Safrai/Opera, 40% on mozilla, and rest on other versions of IE *
[11:55:59] <swiggy> 12
[11:56:00] <swiggy> not 22
[11:56:07] <Snerf> and they pay $1200 a month, and cant update their PC?
[11:56:34] <Snerf> something is very wrong there.. if you ask me..
[11:56:36] <swiggy> but anyway
[11:56:44] <swiggy> how can i fix this problem
[11:56:52] <Snerf> tell them to update their browsers, thats how
[11:57:23] <swiggy> wiggy> they probably do not know how to. or want to upgrade
[11:57:43] <Snerf> i read that, then you make a nice technical document for them and show them how
[11:58:09] <Snerf> IE6 came out, what, 10 years ago?
[11:58:15] <fwaokda> I'm wanting to put some html in a the following tag but before the tag that's already there... can i do this with `append` or do i do it with something else? <div id="blah"><div class="heynow"></div></div>
[11:58:30] <djQuery> http://saveie6.com
[11:58:46] <nail_> For a paying service I'd rather add a list of supported browsers in the terms and conditions
[11:59:13] <djQuery> heck google is even dropping support for ie7
[11:59:29] <geekbuntu> *google is smart*
[11:59:34] <Snerf> swiggy, I realize it doesnt help you, but honestly, why support it at all?  Its going to give you nothing but grief
[11:59:52] <swiggy> i understand that snerf
[11:59:55] <DynamicFail> Could someone explain to me how I might use .get to display info from a file on my server live?
[12:00:07] <swiggy> but that is not what i have come here to ask/hear
[12:00:12] <swiggy> i dont use IE at all
[12:00:19] <swiggy> its very easy for me to tell them to just use firefox
[12:00:27] <Snerf> swiggy, IE6 support is being dropped probably by a lot of things, your probably SOL
[12:00:35] <swiggy> but not many old people know what to do when you tell them to update/remove/install a browser
[12:00:52] <Snerf> tlel them to upgrade to IE7 at least, if anything, its called windows update
[12:01:33] <Snerf> yes, I know, I work with old people as well. It sucks, but you have to plan some course of action, instead of supporting old technology which doesnt work
[12:03:28] <Snerf> make a nice installer for them to run, does it all for them, click on the link, VOILA
[12:03:58] <swiggy> i fixed it
[12:04:20] <swiggy> $(this).attr('href').replace('http://www.<yoursite>
[12:04:24] <swiggy> ');
[12:04:33] <swiggy> will just return the rest of the page anyway
[12:04:40] <swiggy> works in IE, Chrome and FF

[12:06:26] <djQuery> DynamicFail: see ?.load
[12:06:26] <bot-t> DynamicFail, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[12:09:32] <DynamicFail_Linu> djQuery, I have gotten it to work with highcharts but I'm interested in going from a single number in a txt file to either an xml or JSON file with multiple values. http://paste.ubuntu.com/628550/ [Line 45] Now, I'm just working on a bash script to create a JSON file and then hope to simply display the contents live in a webpage
[12:09:53] <DynamicFail_Linu> And then format it nicely with css via the Jquery UI
[12:09:54] <djQuery> so say you have a <ul id="menu"><li><a href="home.html">Home</a></li><li><a href="about.html">About</a></li></ul>   $('menu').delegate('a', 'click', function(){  var c = $('#contentarea').addClass('loading').empty().load(this.href, function(){ c.removeClass('loading');})  });
[12:10:09] <Snerf> Looking for a way to refresh the contents of an iframe.
[12:10:10] <djQuery> DynamicFail_Linu: ^^^^^^
[12:10:33] <djQuery> Snerf: set the iframes src attribute
[12:13:41] <KWhat_Work> is there a way to bulk set options for a widget?
[12:14:31] <Snerf> djQuery, no, that doesnt refresh the content. the puts it back to the original src file
[12:14:43] <DynamicFail_Linu> sorry djQuery I'm not following you
[12:15:09] <momito> heya folks, how is everyone doing today
[12:16:08] <Phil> Hi, I'm having an issue similar to ticket #9423- http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9423
[12:16:12] <slackz> Anyone in here good with Tablesorter?
[12:16:18] <Phil> specifically in IE7, anyone feel like helping?
[12:18:15] <Sky[x]> any idea how to track user from ads to purchase ?
[12:18:29] <Sky[x]> from click on ads*
[12:18:54] <comboy_> is there any way of doing $.grep but in-place?
[12:19:15] <momito> doesnt ads service provide that detail for you?
[12:19:53] <momito> i know google.adds does, or atleast if im getting your question right
[12:20:19] <systemfault> comboy: Not really, you could use Array.splice but it would be more trouble for nothing.
[12:22:29] <Sky[x]> momito: i have my custom ads on my page and now i get client who wants to see what users do when come from my page and how many userss make order :)
[12:22:41] <KWhat_Work> why am i getting .option is not a function on my widget?  I thought that was a default method
[12:23:07] <momito> hmmm well since they are clicks it should be quite easy to do just by using php
[12:23:21] <comboy> systemfault: I see, meybe there is a function that can replace array for me? my problem is that many objcets have reference to that array, and I dont want to change it in all these places, but I want to filter data in that array
[12:23:43] <djQuery> DynamicFail_Linu: http://jquery.github.com/jquery-tmpl/demos/movies/PagesCore/movies.html
[12:24:11] <systemfault> comboy: Then you have no choice I guess :(
[12:24:27] <systemfault> comboy: Write a loop using Array.splice
[12:24:45] <DynamicFail> djQuery, what was that link to?
[12:25:15] <djQuery> DynamicFail: crazy .template example
[12:25:20] <momito> i actually have a question myself, is it a known problem that IE doesnt handle .css backgroundImage's ?
[12:25:25] <DynamicFail> ok
[12:25:28] <djQuery> using data from the netflix api
[12:25:31] <DynamicFail> thanks
[12:25:36] <comboy> systemfault: thanks

[12:29:32] <djQuery> ?ask@silver1
[12:29:32] <bot-t> silver1, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:29:39] <finetic> http://pastebin.com/YuLJGA7j - does anyone see what i am doing wrong here? Somehow it does not redirect me to index_en.html
[12:30:11] <momito> or actually, can anyone maybe tell me or explain to me why this piece doesnt function on IE. $('#fullscreenbg').css('background-image','url("img/' + img + '.jpg")');
[12:30:51] <djQuery> momito: what version jquery? think some versions had an issue applying css that has a - in it
[12:31:03] <djQuery> think 1.6 and fixed in 1.62
[12:31:06] <momito> the last one
[12:31:16] <momito> but let me check to be sure
[12:31:33] <Silver1> i have a webpage with ajax loading. when i click link1, content1 is loaded, when i click link2, content2 is loaded. if i click link1 again, the content is loaded twice. why is that and how can i resolve this?
[12:31:36] <momito> 1.6.1
[12:31:56] <momito> its fixed in 1.6.2 u think?
[12:32:04] <djQuery> momito: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9237
[12:32:40] <Snerf> Looking for a way to refresh the contents of an iframe. changing .src places it back to the original source, it does not refresh the content (navigated to a different page other then original src)
[12:33:06] <Silver1> the code is at: www.mangome.de/dev1
[12:33:08] <djQuery> momito: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/06/14/jquery-162rc1-released/
[12:33:29] <momito> djQuery: thanks a lot m8
[12:33:45] <djQuery> Snerf: setting the src = to the src does refresh it even ifthey have navigated
[12:34:09] <m8> momito, np :)
[12:34:24] <KWhat_Work> widget documentation really needs some work
[12:34:46] <djQuery> KWhat_Work: yes ajpiano has mentioned redoing it
[12:34:53] <Snerf> djQuery, no it doesnt, it places it back to the original page. This is also on a different domain, if that makes a difference
[12:36:03] <Silver1> please PM me, if you have the answer
[12:36:15] <KWhat_Work> djQuery: should option work by default or do i need to create that funcation and pas data to _setOption ?
[12:37:24] <djQuery> KWhat_Work: hmmm I think there are changes coming in 1.9 that may make it to where u dont have to have a setoption
[12:38:57] <KWhat_Work> djQuery: i am still trying to figure out how to set options on a widget.  obj.mywidget('option', key, value) seems to work but then how do i set multiple options?
[12:40:01] <djQuery> but currently u need to have a _setOption and it needs to call. $.ui.PLUGINNAME.protype.setoption.call(key,Â value);
[12:40:14] <KWhat_Work> djQuery: im on 1.9
[12:40:18] <DynamicFail_Linu> djQuery, I tried to make a VERY basic example fail.html http://paste.ubuntu.com/628567/ data.js is just: {"info": [ { "title:":"Color", "value:":"7" }, {"title:":"Type",
[12:40:18] <DynamicFail_Linu> "value:":"1"} ] }
[12:41:03] <DynamicFail_Linu> it doesn't seem to get anything from data.title or data.value
[12:42:00] <djQuery> KWhat_Work: when you initialy set the widget to the element you can do multiples $('div').dialog({open: funciton(){}, modal: true, etc: 'etc'})  but after it has been initialy done to the eleemnt I belive you can only do them 1 at a time.
[12:43:49] <djQuery> KWhat_Work: here is 1 I was working on but kinda stopped http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/paStV/
[12:44:21] <aminpy> there is a function for find and element's id?

[12:46:25] <djQuery> aminpy: if you have this it will always be faster to do this.id, you are being kinda ambiguois if you mean selecting them element by id $('#elementID')   or getting the id after it has been gotten
[12:47:07] <momito> djQuery: just loaded 1.6.2, unfortunately its still not working on IE :(, thnx for the help though
[12:47:07] <KWhat_Work> im not sure where these 'default' functions are but the def dont work until i set them up
[12:47:10] <aminpy> .attr('id') <- thanks
[12:47:46] <KWhat_Work> mywidget('option', 'status', 'fail'); doesnt set shit
[12:47:50] <djQuery> KWhat_Work: have you gone over this? http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/
[12:49:54] <djQuery> KWhat_Work:  var x = $('div').mywidget({status: 'win'}).mywidget('option', 'status', 'fail').mywidget('optiuon', 'status'); console.log(x);
[12:50:12] <KWhat_Work> djQuery: fyi, still need the _setOptions in 1.9 unless that hasnt been implemented in the milestone release yet
[12:50:34] <djQuery> KWhat_Work: are u trying to set global defaults?
[12:50:46] <djQuery> KWhat_Work: thanks for the heads up
[12:51:49] <KWhat_Work> ahh nice you can do .mywidget('option', {}) even after its created
[12:52:59] <momito> ok its either my code (probably) or IE is just having a piss one me. Anyone know why this isnt working on IE but on all other browsers it does http://advacomftp.nl/scripts/basic/

[13:09:35] <wroos> Is there an easy way to accomplish this with jquery?
[13:09:53] <slackz> Anyone here that knows the jQuery Tablesorter plugin?
[13:09:58] <wroos> ravenzz, Yes.
[13:10:19] <momito> CyberKatze: did you put enctype="multipart/form-data" in the form?
[13:10:43] <CyberKatze> -> momito = yes... ((((

[13:18:22] <ravenzz> wroos you have only 2 images?
[13:18:23] <Dr4g> I used vTip plugin..
[13:18:27] <Dr4g> Any comments on my CSS styling? Hover over the download link on the right to see the styled tooltip: http://ppiframework.com/
[13:19:12] <wroos> ravenzz: No its a whole gallery, maybe 50 or 100.
[13:19:32] <ravenzz> i mean 2 images in the same div.fade
[13:19:48] <wroos> yes. :)
[13:20:14] <ravenzz> so 2 images per div
[13:20:28] <wroos> Thats correct.
[13:20:50] <ravenzz> you can try something like $('div.fade img:last').hide(); $('div.fade').hover(function() { $(this).find('img').fadeToggle() });
[13:20:53] <SeanJM> I am trying to see if an input box value is null, I tried using size and length for it and I am still not being able to check if the value is null
[13:22:14] <wroos> ravenzz: I'm trying...
[13:22:27] <momito> is it possible to execute a fadein after applying a .css backgroundImage to a div? so after the image has been completely loaded
[13:24:10] <SeanJM> if ($(this).val() !== 0) { $(this).attr("editVal",v); }
[13:24:25] <SeanJM> I am creating a temporary attribute to store the value of the input
[13:24:54] <wroos> ravenzz: I'm sorry but I can't get it to work. :S
[13:25:42] <SeanJM> if ($(this).val().size !== 0) { $(this).attr("editVal",v); } wont work and if ($(this).val().length !== 0) { $(this).attr("editVal",v); }
[13:27:14] <SeanJM> just solved it if ($(this).val() != "") { $(this).attr("editVal",v); }
[13:33:12] <ravenzz> wroos ok wait i'll try that
[13:33:32] <wroos> Thanks!
[13:33:44] <dabear> SeanJM: let me shorten that for you: this.value || this.editVal = v;
[13:35:52] <ravenzz> wroos oh sh1t. i must go :[ anyway that's quite simple .. reask here, someone will help you
[13:36:10] <wroos> Thanks anyway! :)

[13:41:37] <k_89> http://pastebin.com/0updAxxT ... can someone check this out, i am trying to make a custom unique url reader + ajax caller
[13:41:45] <k_89> it doesn't seem to qork
[13:42:35] <DynamicFail> Is there a way to access a specific item in a JSON File for example Lets Say I have {"posts": [ { "color": "red", "type":"long"}, { "color": "blue", "type":"short"} ] } Is there a way to say I want posts[0].type or post[where key=red].type
[13:43:37] <systemfault> DynamicFail: You parse it into an object then access that object directly.
[13:43:54] <k_89> DynamicFail,  try this for(var key in json_obj){ //whatever you want to do, json_obj[key] == json_obj.key}
[13:44:58] <wroos> Can someone help me with a fade on hover function?
[13:45:25] <wroos> Trying to get a gallery to fade between two images on hover: http://paste2.org/p/1475441
[13:49:19] <zmoazeni> wroos: You're not wrapping those calls in an document.onready, it may be firing too quickly
[13:49:41] <zmoazeni> wroos: What happens if you wrap it in $(function() { ... your code here } ) ?
[13:50:00] <k_89> does anybody know how to make a unique url
[13:50:13] <k_89> does anybody know how to make a unique url js controller
[13:50:15] <DynamicFail> systemfault, k_89 Alright (bear with me I'm new) but first I need to read it into a variable it sounds like so something like <script type="text/javascript"> $.getJSON("data.js",function(data) or something?
[13:50:24] <wroos> zmoazeni: I'll try...
[13:51:33] <DynamicFail> All I want to do is just display a specifc item in a json file on a webpage
[13:52:14] <k_89> Dynamicfail, a json file is bascially a .js file right??
[13:52:39] <wroos> zmoazeni: Now it fade! But it doesn't toggle the images. :S
[13:52:45] <DynamicFail> yep
[13:52:53] <DynamicFail> in fact i have it named .js
[13:53:23] <zmoazeni> wroos: Cool, i'm not sure on the toggling/fading part. That's just something that stuck out when I saw your code
[13:53:51] <wroos> zmoazeni: Ok, thanks for your help anyway!
[13:53:57] <k_89> DynamicFail, try this: can you assign that json obj to a variable in starting of that file?
[13:54:54] <k_89> if you can, then try <script type="text/javascript" src="path-to-your-file"></script>
[13:55:11] <zmoazeni> wroos: Another thing I do regularly, is insert a throwaway button or link that calls a function to trigger an event to debug. <input type="button" id="debug-button>Do something</input>  ...then in your script: $('#debug-button).click(function() { ... some code I can manually fire ... });
[13:55:45] <ngharo> wroos: is it possible after the images fade, the div no longer has any content and therefore can't trigger hover again
[13:57:11] <kenthree> why does this scroll down to #foo only when the page is at the top? (in other words, if the scrollbar is halfway down it scrolls to a seemingly random place   $('.features').animate({ scrollTop: $('#foo').position().top});
[13:57:28] <wroos> ngharo: I think it is the css element thing...div.fade img:last but i'm going to change the html, see if it works.
[13:57:42] <wroos> zmoazeni: Good idea!
[13:57:56] <slackz> Anyone in here yet that knows jQuery's Tablesorter? ><
[13:58:28] <AfroTurf> $("input, select").bind("blur change",function(){} is there a way only to get input to fire with blur and select to fire with change?
[13:59:26] <zmoazeni> kenthree: It's been a while, but I think the last time i scripted scrolling, I used this scrollTo plugin: http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/10/jqueryscrollto.html
[13:59:45] <kenthree> zmoazeni: i'll take a look thanks
[14:00:03] <zmoazeni> kenthree: It could be out of date, and something in the core api makes more sense. It's been a while
[14:00:25] <ngharo> AfroTurf: bind them seperately..
[14:01:02] <AfroTurf> :/
[14:02:20] <odyniec> AfroTurf: yeah, and make your handler a named function so that you DRY

[14:18:03] <MoTiOnXml> JSONthanks
[14:18:07] <MoTiOnXml> thanks i mean ;)
[14:18:12] <ml> has anybody an idea how to solve my question posted some minutes ago? (concerning jQuery.getJSON with multiple responses?
[14:18:16] <ch3mical> Hmm that doesn't work anymore?
[14:18:18] <dabear> ?g jsonlint @ MoTiOnXml
[14:18:19] <bot-t> MoTiOnXml, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[14:18:32] <ch3mical> Doesn't work with the name in front I guess
[14:18:35] <dabear> ch3mical: it owrks if you do it correctly
[14:18:48] <dabear> ch3mical: see ?g myass
[14:18:50] <bot-t> ch3mical, Hide My Ass! Free Proxy and Privacy Tools - Surf The Web Anonymously - http://hidemyass.com/
[14:18:50] <MoTiOnXml> so "{ 'type':'list', 'id':'f8a45d25-065d-42a3-90de-7c93ce27b440' }" is invalid?
[14:18:57] <MoTiOnXml> i have to switch the quotes?
[14:19:06] <ch3mical> Can someone help me work out this JSON parser? http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/AZgks/7/ It's returning an Object when it should be returning a string, not sure why (check warnings console)
[14:19:14] <djQuery> dabear: woulda thought jsonlint woulda been one of the item in bot-t's library
[14:19:15] <dabear> MoTiOnXml: a json string can only contain certain chars
[14:19:19] <ch3mical> MoTiOnXml: { 'key': 'value' } is not valid JSON
[14:19:21] <dabear> keys need to be in double quotes
[14:19:29] <MoTiOnXml> damn
[14:19:34] <ch3mical> Values, too
[14:19:39] <MoTiOnXml> i'm porting code that used the mootools JSON parser
[14:19:42] <dabear> except for numericals
[14:19:45] <MoTiOnXml> right
[14:19:46] <ch3mical> Unless it's an integer or boolean
[14:19:55] <ch3mical> or the word null
[14:20:00] <MoTiOnXml> noted
[14:20:01] <dabear> and bools
[14:20:02] <dabear> yep
[14:20:04] <ch3mical> But single quotes are never allowed
[14:20:14] <MoTiOnXml> guess the mootools parser is different at this then
[14:20:20] <djQuery> dabear: it is now see ?jsonlint
[14:20:21] <bot-t> dabear, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[14:20:56] <dabear> djQuery: see ?g yes I know that thanks
[14:20:58] <bot-t> djQuery, Yes I know I'm tall... thanks for telling me. | Facebook - http://www.facebook.com/pages/Yes-I-know-Im-tall-thanks-for-telling-me/319502986176
[14:21:08] <ch3mical> lol
[14:21:33] <MoTiOnXml> so <a href="#" data-jsonID='{ "id": "e4ce1516-5e40-4d0c-9006-4c57a2754bac", "type": "webPartElement" }> be
[14:21:41] <MoTiOnXml> so <a href="#" data-jsonID='{ "id": "e4ce1516-5e40-4d0c-9006-4c57a2754bac", "type": "webPartElement" }'> is valid
[14:22:00] <ch3mical> Looks OK to me
[14:22:01] <MoTiOnXml> feels weird to use single quotes to embed the json id
[14:22:07] <ch3mical> Try JSONlint
[14:22:13] <MoTiOnXml> i mean, for the html attribute
[14:22:20] <djQuery> MoTiOnXml: ques the mootools parser is wrong then
[14:22:24] <ch3mical> html isn't picky
[14:22:28] <MoTiOnXml> ch3mical: yea, i'm thinking escaping
[14:22:55] <ch3mical> I'm thinking of escaping, too
[14:23:29] <MoTiOnXml> how would that look?
[14:23:32] <ch3mical> So, speaking of JSON....
[14:23:37] <ch3mical> Can someone help me work out this JSON parser? http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/AZgks/7/ It's returning an Object when it should be returning a string, not sure why (check warnings console)
[14:23:42] <ch3mical> :)
[14:26:00] <ejo> Help... is there something wrong with http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#multiple-remote ?  It's not working for me in that mode, though i get it to work just fine in single value mode with remote data source.  Pastebin incoming.
[14:27:56] <djQuery> ejo works here what browser\version?
[14:28:00] <ngharo> ch3mical: what should it look like?
[14:28:11] <ejo> Firefox 4 on ubuntu linux
[14:28:25] <djQuery> ejo: chrome 13 here
[14:28:29] <ejo> 4.0.1
[14:28:30] <ml> Is it possible, to receive multiple repsonses/callbacks for one request with jQuery.getJSON? (for example status updates about what the server is currently doing)
[14:28:49] <ejo> djQuery: I know my remote data request goes through and the server replies with the right JSON
[14:29:22] <ejo> djQuery: but on the client side it only draws a very short/thin box that is as wide as the text control into which I was typing, but only about 5 pixels tall, with no contents.
[14:29:24] <djQuery> ml: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[14:29:29] <ch3mical> ngharo: should look like this http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/AZgks/8/
[14:31:28] <ejo> djQuery: I haven't figured out how to use jsfiddle.net properly yet with the resource links, but here it is as a basic pastebin -- http://jsfiddle.net/CzrjK/
[14:33:03] <Silver1> www.mangome.de/dev1
[14:33:47] <SeanJM> jquery and is && right?
[14:34:08] <ejo> djQuery: there... cleaned up better -- http://jsfiddle.net/CzrjK/4/
[14:34:35] <ejo> I may need to replace remote data source with inline data in order to make the pastebin work out at all
[14:34:48] <ejo> since my remote data isn't accessible
[14:34:54] <Silver1> help me learn, i have a problem with my ajax code
[14:37:06] <ngharo> ch3mical: i wouldnt reinvent the wheel
[14:37:10] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/AZgks/9/
[14:37:13] <ngharo> this works
[14:37:53] <MoTiOnXml> ch3mical: btw thanks for helping out on the json-hell
[14:37:59] <ch3mical> np
[14:38:45] <necromancer> how do i apply jQuery.validate rules to a class?
[14:38:51] <ch3mical> ngharo: I need the xml to be namespaced
[14:38:55] <necromancer> i have a class called required
[14:39:03] <ch3mical> ngharo: That's why I reinventing the wheel
[14:39:12] <necromancer> .required can be added to any <input> and the validator will validate its presence
[14:39:30] <Gateway69> anyone point out whats wrong. im trying to resize a div class to 1x1
[14:39:34] <Gateway69>       $("#hide").click(function(){
[14:39:34] <Gateway69>           $('.content').hide(width(1).height(1));
[14:39:34] <Gateway69> 				});
[14:39:43] <ngharo> ch3mical: which means prefixing each xml node with 'ns:' ?
[14:39:49] <gnarf> Gateway69: 1) you're pasting more than one line of code to IRC
[14:39:51] <Brodingo> wuttt
[14:40:13] <Gateway69>       $("#hide").click(function(){ $('.content').hide(width(1).height(1)); });
[14:40:16] <ch3mical> ngharo: right... when I tried that with the builtin parser it broke even worse
[14:40:16] <gnarf> Gateway69: 2) there is no variable called "width"
[14:40:33] <Gateway69> i thought jquery has a width and height value u can set
[14:40:47] <gnarf> Gateway69: it does, you aren't calling a method on a jquery object
[14:40:49] <ngharo> ch3mical: http://jsfiddle.net/AZgks/11/ like that?
[14:40:50] <gnarf> read that code
[14:40:53] <gnarf> "width" is a function
[14:41:01] <gnarf> in some global context
[14:41:02] <Gateway69> sorry ,newbie..
[14:41:08] <gnarf> Gateway69: right
[14:41:16] <gnarf> Gateway69: I can tell (no offense)
[14:41:27] <Gateway69> to jquery
[14:41:33] <Gateway69> so remove the (  )?
[14:41:34] <ch3mical> ngharo: uh, yes
[14:41:44] <gnarf> Gateway69:  c) (to change to letters) are you trying to animate it or just set width/height to 1?
[14:41:53] <ch3mical> ngharo: you just added it to json2xml?
[14:42:10] <KWhat_Work> does the :disabled selector work on any element?  It says it "Selects all elements that are disabled" however i think it only works with forms?
[14:42:23] <gnarf> Gateway69: because if you want width/height 1: $('.content').css({ width: 1, height: 1 }); totally works
[14:42:26] <Gateway69> gnarf: when i click a button, i want the div class to just go to 1x1
[14:42:43] <ngharo> ch3mical: yeah to that function.  http://goessner.net/download/prj/jsonxml/json2xml.js <--this one
[14:42:46] <Gateway69> can i set the visiability tag
[14:42:50] <gnarf> Gateway69: lemme give you a PRO tip tho
[14:42:57] <ch3mical> ngharo: right
[14:43:04] <gnarf> Gateway69: instead of mucking with the css like that via js
[14:43:06] <gnarf> add a class
[14:43:20] <gnarf> $('.content').addClass('alternateState')
[14:43:21] <ch3mical> ngharo: I guess I'll just use that, then... if the license permits
[14:43:34] <gnarf> then in your css: .content.alternateState { width: 1px; height: 1px; }
[14:43:36] <ch3mical> yay for CC
[14:43:39] <Gateway69> k, then alter i can just put my css i want
[14:43:44] <gnarf> then the presentation is left up to the css
[14:43:46] <Gateway69> gotcha.. let me try that
[14:43:51] <gnarf> and the behavior is left to js
[14:44:15] <ch3mical> ngharo: thanks for the help
[14:44:31] <Gateway69> one more a bit advanced question, im trying to hide my flash player to 1x1 with visability none, in a tab, but when u click on another tab and go back the flash player reloads, any tips
[14:44:49] <gnarf> Gateway69: don't use flash?
[14:44:59] <ngharo> ch3mical: np, gl
[14:44:59] <Gateway69> yea.. heh :)
[14:45:09] <Gateway69> well its not flash but some other app we are working on
[14:45:27] <gnarf> Gateway69: i avoid <object> tags in pretty much all forms
[14:45:42] <zmoazeni> Gateway69: Are you doing "display" or "visibility"?
[14:45:57] <zmoazeni> Gateway69: I think flash behaves differently when "display:none" vs "visibility:hidden"
[14:46:05] <necromancer> gnarf: how do you upload large files asynchronously? :)
[14:46:07] <Gateway69> im loading this in a jquery tab.. http://www.pastie.org/private/aoqlr6c0n8a56utq0wysa
[14:46:20] <Gateway69> but when u go from one tab back to this, the player we are using reloads..
[14:46:34] <Gateway69> ahh right hidden
[14:46:36] <zmoazeni> I'm not following when you say "tab", could you explain a little?
[14:46:36] <DaIRC43616> Hello was curious if someone could help me with this http://pastebin.com/j7kTXBPh
[14:46:37] <gnarf> necromancer: using an abstraction that uses HTML5, Flash, Silverlight, or plain old HTML4 file uploads
[14:46:56] <Gateway69> lets sat at the top of my web page i have a tab called home | info | player
[14:47:03] <necromancer> gnarf: which library do you use? i've used SWFupload but i don't really like it
[14:47:04] <Gateway69> when I click on each one of these im using #tabs
[14:47:07] <zmoazeni> Ah I gotcha
[14:47:21] <Gateway69> the idea is when u click on info, then back to player that the player doesnt need to refresh or reload
[14:47:25] <Silver1> why is my page loaded double when i load it for the second time`?
[14:47:29] <necromancer> gnarf: also wouldn't that be an <object> tag in a form? :)
[14:47:39] <gnarf> necromancer: yes
[14:47:48] <zmoazeni> I think it's the act of the flash object going from "display:none" to "display:<something>". You may need to move the element (as visibility:hidden) somewhere before/after you switch
[14:47:49] <Silver1> i'm willing to paypal 15$ for the answer
[14:47:52] <gnarf> necromancer: i also generally avoid needing to accept file uploads :)
[14:48:13] <Silver1> for the proper answer :)
[14:48:24] <ejo> rats
[14:48:39] <gnarf> Silver1: ooo, a bounty --- looks for candy
[14:48:42] <zmoazeni> I think that will also happen if an HTML wrapper goes display:none to display:<something> - I had an odd issue on a jquery/flash project.
[14:48:53] <Gateway69> this is what im trying to solve, http://forum.jquery.com/topic/resize-div-id-to-1x1-pixel-when-in-a-different-tab unfrotuanly i was thrown into this task and im mainly a php programmer :)
[14:49:42] <gnarf> Gateway69: my hunch
[14:49:50] <gnarf> is that your object is being hidden by the tab itself
[14:49:54] <DaIRC43616> http://pastebin.com/j7kTXBPh -> this is what I'm trying to solve ^_^ lol
[14:49:56] <Silver1> gnart: are you good with ajax/jquery?
[14:50:03] <gnarf> keeping it 1x1 wont do you much
[14:50:05] <zmoazeni> Yeah, I'm with gnarf  - seems like a safe bet
[14:50:18] <gnarf> you need to somehow get it out of the content that is "tabbing"
[14:50:24] <gnarf> and then 1x1 it
[14:50:26] <ngharo> DaIRC43616: paste the code that is failing, see ?p
[14:50:27] <bot-t> DaIRC43616, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[14:50:37] <Gateway69> people have good exp with making the player go to 1x1, then back to normal, but the tabs throw in a curve ball
[14:50:43] <DaIRC43616> one sec..
[14:50:48] <DaIRC43616> it's on another machine... -_-
[14:50:49] <gnarf> Silver1: nope, this is my first day with jquery </sarcasm>
[14:51:06] <Gateway69> rough crowd :)
[14:51:06] <Silver1> gnarf: let's go :)
[14:51:30] <Silver1> if your name is peter, i'll spend 20$
[14:51:31] <Silver1> :))
[14:51:37] <zmoazeni> Gateway69: I don't know what you're using for the tabs, but you should be able to introduce 2 functions that are hooks. "before I tab"/"after I tab". Then just use HTML to move the flash element to a temporary container while it's supposed to be hidden.
[14:52:03] <Gateway69> jquery ui tabs
[14:52:09] <zmoazeni> Gateway69: It'll take a little coding, but that's probably the approach I'd take
[14:52:16] <gnarf> Gateway69: cool, that means you can hook some events
[14:52:18] <xxiao> hi, i set up a everyTime timer but for the very first one I need run it longer? how to do it?
[14:52:27] <Gateway69>             $(document).ready(function () {$("#tabs").tabs(); });
[14:52:36] <xxiao> otherwise it may overlap and the behaviour is undefined if that happens
[14:52:53] <zmoazeni> Gateway69: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#event-select
[14:53:07] <xxiao> in document.ready, i can run a async=false oneshot timer? then somehow enable a everyTime timer?
[14:53:07] <Silver1> gnarf: are you with me or spend the rest of the day alone
[14:53:15] <xxiao> they do the same, but the first timer will take way longer to finish
[14:53:16] <Gateway69> other people are on the case and having issues with it as well :( http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/92322-jquery-tab-aind-Unity3d
[14:53:29] <zmoazeni> Doh, that link didn't take it straight there. Check out the "Events | select" hook
[14:54:53] <Gateway69> yea so tabselect, tabs load etc.. events.. so can i hide the player as 1x1 when someone selects a new tab, then on tabselect player bring it back to proper size.. or
[14:55:30] <zmoazeni> You may need to use jquery to move the actual HTML element to another element that isn't affected by hiding/showing
[14:55:30] <gnarf> Gateway69: honestly, I would make the "tab" for that particular tab empty
[14:55:46] <ejo> http://jsfiddle.net/CzrjK/9/  -- I'm stuck trying to figure out autocomplete with multi values here
[14:55:48] <zmoazeni> *HTML element that wraps the flash object
[14:55:50] <Gateway69> gnarf: not sure i follow
[14:55:54] <gnarf> Gateway69: and then use DOM to "inject" the player div into that tab
[14:55:55] <ejo> I can make it work great with single value but multiple is evading me
[14:56:03] <Gateway69> sorry not using flash.. no <object>
[14:56:09] <gnarf> when that tab is selected
[14:56:31] <gnarf> Gateway69: you have some "div" that is created right
[14:56:41] <gnarf> Gateway69: create it "outside" of the tab
[14:56:51] <Gateway69> my tab calls player.php in player php is html code, with some js code for the player
[14:56:54] <gnarf> when another tab is selected, MOVE the element to the body
[14:56:55] <dtach> can i check if a variable contains a certain word? like 'site'
[14:57:07] <ejo> I'm basically using the example code so I don't get what I'm doing wrong
[14:57:19] <ejo> (the demo code from the jquery-ui page)
[14:57:22] <gnarf> Gateway69: is it making more than one request for player.php ?
[14:57:36] <gnarf> Gateway69: because if so, it makes total sense because you are injecting "fresh" content
[14:57:54] <gnarf> Gateway69: you might want to think about settting a high expire time on player.php and making sure it "caches"
[14:57:56] <Gateway69> hmm, this is gonna take me a while.. doh..
[14:58:09] <gnarf> Gateway69: if thats the case
[14:58:12] <Gateway69> gnarf: yea, hmm, time to dive in
[14:58:28] <gnarf> Gateway69: you could use .load to inject the html manually
[14:58:39] <gnarf> ?ftj @Gateway69
[14:58:40] <bot-t> Gateway69, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[14:59:13] <Gateway69> i picked up a jquery + php book, gonna go over it this weekend, but thought i could hammer our something.. looks like im wrong :)
[14:59:21] <gnarf> Silver1: and sorry, you still haven't stated a question --- see ?ask
[14:59:21] <bot-t> Silver1, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:00:02] <ejo> I've stated a question :(
[15:00:06] <ejo> and pastebinned
[15:00:11] <Silver1> gnarf: my html is shown 2 times if i click on the link 2nd time
[15:00:11] <Gateway69> anyhow thanks guys for the info.. gets me in a direction.. now to put some gas in the volkswagen :)
[15:00:28] <Silver1> gnarf: i think it has to do with the cache
[15:00:31] <gnarf> ejo:  what is the problem you're having with it?
[15:00:52] <gnarf> Silver1: have you tried tracing it using dev tools?
[15:01:04] <Silver1> gnarf: yes
[15:01:06] <gnarf> Silver1: you can break on dom insertion in chrome dev tools
[15:01:13] <gnarf> and?
[15:01:24] <gnarf> what is inserting the second set? why isn't it emptying()
[15:01:26] <Silver1> gnarf: is chrome better than FF+firebug?
[15:01:30] <ejo> gnarf, my search text is getting ajaxed and my server is responding correctly with JSON, but the resulting display doesn't show anything that lets me choose from the return values.
[15:01:47] <ejo> gnarf: i'm using this as an autocomplete "search box" from among certain values in a backend database
[15:01:48] <gnarf> Silver1: paulirish.com/2011/a-re-introduction-to-the-chrome-developer-tools/
[15:02:07] <Silver1> gnarf: that was not my question
[15:02:20] <ejo> gnarf: so my values come back as far as I can tell, but instead of being displayed in a selection dropdown, all I get is a shrunk version of the dropdown that is about 5px tall by the full width of the text entry box.
[15:02:35] <gnarf> ejo: this example has a static source
[15:02:47] <gnarf> ejo: can I see your example with your attempt at the ajax call?
[15:02:57] <ejo> yes, i switched to static because my server isn't internet accessible for you to try it for real
[15:03:04] <ejo> but sure I can paste in the ajax example
[15:03:29] <ejo> http://jsfiddle.net/CzrjK/10/
[15:03:56] <ejo> on my server side I'm seeing the submission work fine, the search and match works, and good JSON is sent in response
[15:04:14] <ejo> I'm running Firebug of course but I haven't identified a good break point to catch what's wrong
[15:05:34] <gnarf> ejo: and what does the json look like?
[15:05:52] <gnarf> ejo: are you using jsonp?
[15:06:04] <gnarf> ejo: does firebug/webkit inspector see the json properly
[15:06:17] <ejo> for example:  [{'id': 1L, 'name': u'Ski'}, {'id': 3L, 'name': u'Ski Binding'}] (but that was on the python server side)
[15:06:29] <gnarf> ejo: okay
[15:06:30] <ejo> where would I break to catch the return value?
[15:06:37] <ejo> not sure where to breakpoint here.
[15:06:41] <gnarf> you don't look in the "network" tab for "script"
[15:06:57] <ejo> what do you mean i don't...
[15:06:59] <gnarf> it should be in JSONP unless your webpage is also served on 127.0.0.1:5000
[15:07:09] <gnarf> ejo: you don't need to break the code
[15:07:13] <ejo> I know.  my server is also same domain
[15:07:14] <gnarf> just look at the request in the network pane

[15:07:29] <bot-t> ejo, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[15:07:31] <gnarf> its a bitch
[15:07:35] <ejo> right, I know that
[15:07:42] <gnarf> port numbers count
[15:07:43] <necromancer> heh
[15:07:44] <ejo> In this case server and client are both my dev machine, no prob
[15:07:49] <gnarf> rock
[15:07:51] <gnarf> moving on
[15:07:52] <ejo> and same port
[15:07:53] <gnarf> json
[15:07:54] <ejo> good
[15:07:56] <gnarf> network panel
[15:08:07] <necromancer> ejo: did you check the response to make sure it's coming back as JSON rather than HTML?
[15:08:20] <gnarf> also, i think UI expects an array of arrays in response
[15:08:28] <ejo> I'm trying
[15:08:29] <gnarf> so you might need to write a function to take yours
[15:08:34] <gnarf> lemme see my autocomplete
[15:08:44] <ejo> my server is working perfectly with another autocomplete control that is single-value
[15:09:01] <gnarf> what do you mean by single value?
[15:09:08] <necromancer> ejo: are you just making a field that autocompletes against a JSON-provided list of values?
[15:09:27] <ejo> gah, FF4 is getting super sluggish under Firefox since I tried to debug this particular problem
[15:09:38] <necromancer> because there's always http://loopj.com/jquery-tokeninput/
[15:09:45] <necromancer> (don't mind the bad CSS, it does work)
[15:09:46] <ejo> Correct, necromancer, but according to the multiple value select version in the jquery-ui docs
[15:09:59] <necromancer> oh multiple value select ok
[15:10:06] <ejo> necro, i have jquery-ui autocomplete working perfectly in other situations, many
[15:10:13] <ejo> but the others are single value
[15:10:19] <gnarf> ejo: http://jsfiddle.net/j8N9e/
[15:10:21] <necromancer> tokenInput isn't what you're looking for :)
[15:11:08] <ejo> ugh, i think firebug hates chatzilla
[15:11:16] <gnarf> necromancer: response should be an array of [{ label: "label", value: "value" }]
[15:11:27] <gnarf> plus whatever else you want on the ui.item
[15:11:48] <gnarf> the lack of label key in the object is probably the issue
[15:12:07] <gnarf> you might want to write a function to take your server json and respond with proper format for autocomplete
[15:12:23] <ejo> well the server is mine, i can have it send back anythign i want
[15:12:32] <gnarf> ejo: then make it label / value
[15:12:38] <gnarf> instead of id / name
[15:12:44] <ejo> you know that "label" and "value" aren't hardcoded there
[15:12:58] <gnarf> ejo: in what way?
[15:12:59] <ejo> i've changed them in my other instances -- the single value ones that work fine -- and they work
[15:13:16] <gnarf> ejo: right - it also accepts an array of strings
[15:13:19] <ejo> i mean it's only looking for ui.item.value because it says ui.item.value, right?
[15:13:38] <ejo> so if i change the line of javascript to read "ui.item.name" i can use my own field that I called "name".  no?
[15:14:03] <gnarf> ejo: um, changing the json sounds easier than hacking all of autocomplete
[15:14:08] <ejo> by the way your pasted example looks pretty much like my working single-value searchbox tries
[15:14:10] <gnarf> but "name" is the key
[15:14:18] <gnarf> or rather "label"
[15:14:21] <gnarf> i think
[15:14:25] <gnarf> try making a "label"
[15:14:30] <ejo> I didn't hack all of autocomplete -- it's right there in a single line in the "select" option to autocomplete
[15:14:42] <ejo> but ok, your suggestion is too reasonable not to try!  be right back
[15:14:52] <gnarf> ejo: right, but autocomplete itself will use the value (its what it puts inside the box as you select it i believe)
[15:15:10] <ejo> oh you mean that happens somewhere that we don't see in the demo source?
[15:15:19] <ejo> that's what I meant by "hardcoded"
[15:15:26] <ejo> now i see what you mean.  I'll try this, hang on
[15:15:28] <gnarf> ejo: the plugin itself uses it
[15:15:31] <ejo> & thx a bunch for the responses
[15:16:16] <gnarf> also ejo - consider using "/product_type/search" as your url
[15:16:26] <gnarf> that way domain issues wont creep in
[15:16:28] <ejo> i do...
[15:16:37] <ejo> the domain was only there for my pasted example
[15:16:41] <ejo> sorry about that
[15:17:41] <gnarf> aww what a shame, Silver1 went away before his bounty could be fuffilled
[15:18:14] <ejo> OK good, that works.  So you're right, it's hardcoded to expect item.label, item.value.  I really want to be able to use my own property names on the items transferred
[15:18:23] <gnarf> ejo: use both
[15:18:31] <gnarf> ejo: "label" is just for autocompletes sake
[15:18:38] <gnarf> note in my paste example
[15:18:41] <ejo> you're right
[15:18:55] <ejo> i can just piggyback my own properties on the item in addition
[15:19:28] <gnarf> use response( $.map(resonse, function(v) { return { label: v.name, value: v.name, data: v } ) ); for instance
[15:19:43] <gnarf> then all the original data is ui.item.data
[15:19:49] <ejo> well, this gets me on my way.  Thanks again for responding
[15:19:55] <gnarf> and the label/value are coerced closer to where they should be
[15:20:03] <gnarf> in the autocomplete plugin part
[15:20:04] <ejo> yeah, i think the .success callback is what I was forgetting I could do
[15:20:14] <gnarf> switch to .ajax()
[15:20:26] <gnarf> way easier to work with when you wanna do something "non-trival" with it
[15:20:30] <ejo> yeah.  $.getJSON was messing me up
[15:20:49] <ejo> I now remember more clearly that I went through these same steps when setting up my simpler single-value autocomplete example a year back.
[15:21:06] <gnarf> born to repeat itself
[15:21:18] <DaIRC43616> as requested: http://jsfiddle.net/MgGn6/
[15:21:27] <DaIRC43616> Sorry it took me so long @work lol
[15:21:37] <gnarf> DaIRC43616: huh?
[15:21:43] <gnarf> DaIRC43616: thats a ton of code
[15:21:43] * ejo bows to gnarf :)
[15:21:54] <gnarf> ?js hi5("ejo", "gnarf")
[15:21:54] <bot-t> gnarf: "ejo _o/\o_ gnarf"
[15:22:00] <ejo> haha
[15:22:11] * gnarf hugs bot-t
[15:22:12] * bot-t hugs gnarf back
[15:22:15] <DaIRC43616> it's froma  template... you wanted it...
[15:22:22] <gnarf> DaIRC43616: ummm
[15:22:23] <DaIRC43616> the only part that is really a problem I believe
[15:22:29] <DaIRC43616> is the stuff in the first <SCRIPT> tag section
[15:22:33] <DaIRC43616> but the notes should explain the problem
[15:23:09] <DaIRC43616> it works when on the html file directly and the html file is directly called, but when I put it all in teh <HEAD> section and call the html file into a div layer... the code no longer works
[15:25:59] <xxiao> var xyz=....find("pattern");
[15:26:08] <DaIRC43616> don't really understand why it would stop working though...
[15:26:12] <xxiao> how do I use "if" to check if xyz has valid value or not?
[15:26:58] <odyniec> xxiao: what do you consider a valid value?
[15:27:04] <RobW> Does anyone know, with this plugin http://flowplayer.org/tools/scrollable/index.html#demos , how to make it an infinite scroller?
[15:27:35] <RobW> nevermind
[15:27:38] <xxiao> odyniec: if pattern is found, xyz = "OK", otherwise i don't know, supposed to be an empty string?
[15:27:59] <xxiao> i have <p id="patternx">OK</p>
[15:28:11] <DaIRC43616> well g2g will try later tonight I guess
[15:28:20] <xxiao> var xyz=...find("p#pattern");
[15:28:45] <odyniec> xxiao: so you want to find out if any DOM element was matched? if so, then check the .length property
[15:28:52] <xxiao> so xyz="OK" idealy, but that OK line may not exist (it's generated dynamically depends on some results)
[15:29:04] <xxiao> odyniec: good suggestion!
[15:29:28] <xxiao> odyniec: thanks. new to the whole thing
[15:34:18] <gnarf> xxiao: also, that selected the ELEMENT not the TEXT
[15:49:10] <xxiao> gnarf: i do have tempDisplay1=$(document.createElement('div')).html(msgx).find('#joined')
[15:49:22] <xxiao> if( $.trim(tempDisplay1) == 'Already_Joined')
[15:49:34] <xxiao> already_joined = 1;}
[15:49:37] <xxiao> will that work?
[15:49:52] <xxiao> msgx is from ajax's success(msgx)
[15:50:36] <xxiao> <p id="joined">Alread_Joined</p>
[15:51:00] <xxiao> if the find fails, what tempDisplay1 will be then?
[15:51:15] <xxiao> emptry string? undefined type?
[15:52:23] <xxiao> actually i care less about the text in <p>, but more about if this element(#joined) exists or not
[15:53:07] <xxiao> how to check tempDisplay1 to decide if the 'find' success or failed?
[16:00:11] <gesman> Hello
[16:01:52] <gesman> Q: How to detect that i already attached event handler to element and prevent doing it second time. The code is: ~  $("form#blah").submit(function(){ ... });
[16:03:35] <snover> gesman: change when you are attaching it so it doesnâ€™t get reattached.
[16:03:43] <snover> so it doesnâ€™t have an opportunity to get attached twice.
[16:03:50] <dabear> gesman: if you need to do that, your code is wrong
[16:04:44] <gesman> dabear, code is javascript "product" widget. There could be one product on page or multiple products widget on page. Each widget needs to "initialize" forms on page by attaching handlers.
[16:05:58] <dabear> if one widget initializes a form, it should take ownership of that form so no other widget can use it. if so, just use .data on the form to set a flag, see ?data
[16:05:59] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[16:06:21] <gesman> dabear, yes, i think .data would do
[16:06:55] <djQuery> RobW: see if it has scrolled to the end then do an ajax to get more content. or did you mean to wrap around to the start/
[16:06:56] <djQuery> ?
[16:08:47] <gesman> How to correctly compare with 'undefined'?   == undefined?  === undefined?  == "undefined"  === "undefined" ?
[16:08:53] <djQuery> gesman: $('form#blah:not(.addedallready)').addClass('addedallready').submit(function(){})
[16:10:06] <luxigo> for some reason the onclick handler for a dialog button is not called on chromium when an onchange handler for an input is called before (have to click ok twice so that the button onclick handler is called)  http://pastebin.com/JUEfafNx
[16:10:15] <luxigo> no problem with firefox
[16:10:30] <gesman> djQueryyes, that interesting way too
[16:11:25] <djQuery> gesman: or better to use delegate or live so that you dont have to worry about it
[16:15:56] <djQuery> luxigo: you would get a lot better responses with a fiddle or jsbin
[16:16:49] <djQuery> pastie sites suck
[16:17:29] <snover> djQuery: youâ€™re making it worse, not better :)
[16:18:27] <djQuery> snover: which comment/
[16:18:41] <snover> ('form#blah:not(.addedallready)').addClass('addedallready')
[16:18:53] <snover> form#blah is already a horrible selector in its own right
[16:19:19] <snover> thatâ€™s also not an appropriate use of a class.
[16:19:43] <djQuery> snover: agreed. I typicaly put all my click\change\submit handlers in 1 place and try to use live or delegate instead
[16:19:44] <dabear> I guess snover's the more classier type here
[16:19:47] <dabear> :)
[16:19:51] <snover> Iâ€™m superclassy baby
[16:19:52] <dabear> hihi
[16:22:02] <gesman> Will this code work? Does second line is guaranteed to be executed after DIV is populated with new HTML?   $(".mydiv").html('<div id="blah">hi</div>'); $("#blah").html("Hello");
[16:24:00] <snover> ?tias @ gesman
[16:24:01] <bot-t> gesman, Try It And See
[16:24:32] <gesman> bot-t, it works in my case.
[16:24:33] <bot-t> gesman, .scrollTop() - Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[16:25:44] <dabear> gesman: bot-t is a bot
[16:25:56] <gesman> oh, well
[16:26:04] <gesman> I'll drink to him tonight
[16:29:19] <gnarf> bot-t: are you a bot?
[16:29:20] <bot-t> gnarf, Outlook not so good.
[16:29:24] <gnarf> i dunno
[16:30:15] <dabear> gnarf: are YOU a bot?
[16:30:24] <gnarf> dabear: yes
[16:34:57] <ejo> gnarf: I got my autocomplete working well enough.  Question, though: it seems to only put the 'label' field into the resulting list, rather than showing 'label' but depositing 'value'.
[16:35:37] <ejo> Where would I put code to stash that 'value' (or any of my other custom fields) in another element?  In the 'success' callback on $.ajax?
[16:35:59] <ejo> no; because when 'success' is called, the user hasn't selected from the suggestion box yet.
[16:36:33] <ejo> so I guess in the 'select' callback, huh... duh, answered my own question.  I forgot both event and ui are available there.
[16:36:45] * ejo listens to crickets chirp
[16:37:16] <GeoDud> *chirp chirp*
[16:38:17] <gnarf> ejo: select
[16:38:24] <ejo> yep
[16:38:26] <gnarf> ?hi5 @ejo
[16:38:26] <bot-t> ejo, âµ
[16:38:29] <ejo> i'm all set
[16:38:35] * ejo hugs bot-t
[16:38:35] * bot-t hugs ejo back
[16:38:56] <ejo> must be siesta time in here!
[16:39:18] <blindMoe> damn straight
[16:39:22] <ejo> They really should put this full-strength version in the autocomplete docs as a further example.  think they're open to that?
[16:39:24] <blindMoe> friday at 4:40pm
[16:42:18] <gnarf> ejo: we are working on newer docs that will make it easier to maintain
[16:42:47] <gnarf> ejo I'll try to come up with a better way to describe source/response values in the docs
[16:42:48] <gnarf> :)
[16:44:17] <djQuery> gnarf: any plans with making it work with a <input type="text" multilple list="tags" />  <datalist id="tags"><option>jquery</option></datalist>
[16:44:50] <djQuery> gnarf: some of the other ui plugins are smart enough to detect items seems like autocmplete should be as well
[16:45:13] <gnarf> djQuery: I would imagine if we did, its an extension to autocomplete
[16:45:26] <gnarf> not neccesarily builtin
[16:45:30] <ejo> super, gnarf
[16:45:32] <gnarf> its def an edge case
[16:45:42] <gnarf> but i know of no such plan
[16:45:59] <gnarf> have you checked for a bug / feature request on the bugs.jqueryui.com ?
[16:46:02] <djQuery> gnarf: its an edge for now but as more people adopt html5 maybe not so sharp
[16:46:07] <ejo> yeah datalist would be great in my case -- exactly what's needed.  I'm going to just make my own table out of my returns
[16:46:19] <gnarf> ejo:  you could already use datalist
[16:46:26] <ejo> oh ok
[16:46:31] <gnarf> the "multiple" is the broken part for autocomplete atm
[16:46:31] <djQuery> ejo: gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/UsLnM/
[16:46:56] <gnarf> djQuery: one bitch about that
[16:47:03] <gnarf> djQuery: it really should only need to scan that datalist once
[16:47:10] <djQuery> its still doesnt support multiple
[16:47:23] <ejo> hmm, doesn't work in my browser
[16:47:40] <gnarf> djQuery: ejo's fiddle might show you how to do multiple
[16:47:40] <djQuery> ejo: browser?
[16:47:53] <djQuery> ejo: link?
[16:47:56] <gnarf> you can parse the "last" element off your "request"
[16:48:12] <ejo> FF 4.0.1 on Ubuntu 11.04
[16:48:27] <ejo> let me repost my fiddle
[16:48:31] <ejo> now that I got it runnin
[16:50:23] <xxiao> i have a timer shot every 30 seconds, in that i have a sync ajax call which occasionaly could take longer than 30 seconds to return
[16:50:32] <xxiao> what's the best way to deal with that
[16:50:41] <gnarf> i also recently did an interface that uses autocomplete for a "tagger"
[16:50:57] <gnarf> that on select appended the item value to a ul that contained the interface to remove em
[16:51:20] <gnarf> worked out pretty hot
[16:51:42] <ejo> http://jsfiddle.net/tBcpT/
[16:52:02] <ejo> gnarf, that's basically what I'm doing, will be either a ul or a table or something
[16:52:04] <gnarf> djQuery: note the (albeit crude) extractLast() on the term
[16:52:26] <gnarf> ejo: do you want to see my whole autocomplete for my tagger?
[16:52:37] <ejo> Instead of extractLast I'm going to have the control clear itself after every select and just enter what was chosen elsewhere in the form
[16:52:38] <djQuery> ?extractlast
[16:52:39] <bot-t> djQuery, asp.net - jQuery autocomplete: how to split the string result ... - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2594012/jquery-autocomplete-how-to-split-the-string-result
[16:52:54] <gnarf> djQuery: the function is written inside that code :)
[16:53:02] <gnarf> ejo: ++ to that approach btw
[16:53:09] <gnarf> although it breaks progressive enhancing
[16:53:12] <gnarf> but *shrug* :)
[16:53:13] <ejo> gnarf: yes and no, I'm happy with how it's going
[16:53:28] <gnarf> ejo: maybe you see some inspiration buried in my implementation
[16:53:30] <ejo> yeah... that's a bit of a bigger challenge with each passing year sometimes
[16:53:41] <ejo> allrighty gnarf, link it :D
[16:53:59] <gnarf> ejo: pulling it out of code 1 sec
[16:54:12] <djQuery> gnarf: err yeah ok. looks like it needs to be extended to accept a split char
[16:55:03] <djQuery> bald eagle, falcon
[16:55:10] <ejo> oh that would be good, allowing other choices of split char
[16:55:16] <ejo> frog, salamander
[16:55:49] <djQuery> well sometime you need 2 words for the search like you searchin firstname lastname   etc...
[16:56:04] <ejo> sure
[16:56:19] <ejo> frog, komodo dragon, pygmy squid
[16:56:20] <gnarf> ejo: https://gist.github.com/9111c4541a544e0cb184
[16:56:23] <ejo> thx!
[16:57:36] <ejo> love it
[16:58:13] <ejo> i'll be looking at that again in a couple of weeks, got another use coming up that's similar to tagging
[16:58:43] <gnarf> ejo: the "hidden" stores a json object
[16:58:51] <gnarf> that is updated by the interface as changes are made
[16:59:08] <gnarf> works well -- and doesn't render anything on non-js
[16:59:15] <ejo> yes, I like that.
[16:59:39] <gnarf> the html is basically just a div with a hidden in it
[17:00:24] <gnarf> and another version i just wrote actually has a better "remove"
[17:00:34] <gnarf> it doesn't rebind the event ever
[17:00:45] <gnarf> but that one works solidly
[17:01:00] <ejo> ok, back to the salt mines
[17:01:04] <gnarf> because "remove" removes handlers ;)
[17:01:10] <gnarf> ?glwt @ejo
[17:01:11] <bot-t> ejo, Good Luck With That
[17:01:12] <ejo> yeah, true
[17:01:15] <ejo> thanks!
[17:02:58] <djQuery> ejo: basicaly we need to come up with a good :dataListSource   option for autocomplete. then create a plugin that sets the source: if the input has the datalist attribute.
[17:03:39] <djQuery> ignore it if the autocomple allready has a source option
[17:04:17] <jtascher> Could anyone tell me why this: http://jsfiddle.net/LFQ6k/ is returning -1 instead of 1?
[17:07:10] <snover> jtascher: your selectors are reversed.
[17:07:22] <jtascher> snover: how so?
[17:07:29] <jtascher> the first selector gets a group of items
[17:07:32] <jtascher> the second gets a single item
[17:07:40] <snover> and thatâ€™s exactly the opposite of how .index works.
[17:07:51] <gnarf> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/LUgcL/
[17:07:52] <snover> â€œIf a selector string is passed as an argument, .index() returns an integer indicating the position of the original element relative to the elements matched by the selector.â€
[17:08:01] <ejo> djQuery: sounds good
[17:08:04] <Tigeda> Using jquery.ui.tabs, how do you make the tabs work when the <ul> full of links is in a completely seperate div/region to the <div class="panes"> container?
[17:08:12] <Tigeda> have tried like so, but no luck:  http://pastie.org/2085156
[17:08:35] <jtascher> snover: hmm ok, I'll give it a try, thanks
[17:10:04] <djQuery> Tigeda: well typicaly the tabs are like <ul><li><a href="#contentid">content</a></li></ul>  so it should be able to find $('#contentid') anywhere on the page right?
[17:10:49] <jtascher> snover: this seems to give me the same thing: http://jsfiddle.net/LFQ6k/2/
[17:11:29] <Tigeda> hm ok, I thought if their were for examples, four links, & four content divs wrapped in a <div class="panes"> or whatever class, it worked out which link belonged to which div based on the order?
[17:11:44] <snover> jtascher: what is a selector?
[17:12:06] <jtascher> not sure what you mean?
[17:12:51] <snover> I mean, what does â€œselector stringâ€ mean in the context of the documentation I just quoted at you
[17:13:04] <Tigeda> <div class="selector">
[17:13:22] <Tigeda> <div>  as selectore would be:  $('div')
[17:13:34] <snover> no
[17:13:37] <jtascher> snover: I see what you're saying, but the docs say you can pass a jquery object as well
[17:13:46] <jtascher> actually they say a dom element
[17:13:48] <jtascher> maybe that's my issue
[17:15:01] <jtascher> snover: how about this one: http://jsfiddle.net/LFQ6k/3/   :)
[17:15:12] <jtascher> oh whoops
[17:15:13] <jtascher> typo
[17:15:16] <jtascher> ahh
[17:15:18] <jtascher> ok i got it
[17:15:19] <jtascher> thanks :)
[17:15:43] <Tigeda> hm I think what I am trying to do I should use jquery.tools
[17:17:00] <Tigeda> Ive done it before in a different site but thought I had used ui.tabs
[17:17:10] <Tigeda> went back and checked and realized it was jquery.tools.tabs
[17:25:35] <CrossX> I'm trying to make an RTE in JS.  It's actually done already.  I want to know how to get the 'design' mode of FX's iframe to return its HTML formatted with tabs and \r\n's instead of on one line. when I switch my RTE widget between 'design' and 'code' mode, any HTML made in the 'design' mode is returned on a single line.  I'm using    iframe.contentWindow.document.body.innerHTML to get the
[17:25:36] <CrossX> value of the design mode of the iframe.
[17:27:21] <miketaylr> um wat
[17:27:53] <miketaylr> i think i'd rather get kicked in the teeth than try to make aa RTE
[17:27:56] <miketaylr> s/aa/a/
[17:28:33] <jrockjiggz> it's possible to convert \r\n to returns in a textarea with \\n
[17:29:07] <CrossX> miketaylr: It's a lot easier than you think.  every browser (via w3c specs) implements an RTE in the IFRAME object.  I'm just using it.
[17:29:42] <CrossX> jrockjiggz: FX's iframe in design mode returns any code written in design mode on a single line.  It's not a textarea, it's an IFRAME in design mode.
[17:30:01] <miketaylr> CrossX: just seems like a problem that's been solved a handful of times already. but don't let me rain on your parade. :)
[17:30:40] <djQuery> hmmm anyone know with ui 1.9 when "self"  inheriting from a widget how to get the item that you are inheriting to fire its create before you do your code?
[17:30:54] <CrossX> miketaylr: The RTE works fine, mozilla has seen to that.  The data it returns in on a single line, so I was hoping for a method that formated the HTML its RTE made.
[17:31:10] <djQuery> trying to extend autocomplete's _create function
[17:31:23] <djQuery> gnarf?
[17:33:40] <CrossX> This is the MDN entry for the RTE: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/rich-text_editing_in_mozilla .  I want _this_ RTE to return formated HTML (tab's+\n's) instead of HTML on a single line.
[17:34:42] <CrossX> sorry, it's not W3C, it's implemented on all browsers in the same way though.
[17:34:55] <miketaylr> i somewhat doubt that
[17:35:02] <miketaylr> i mean, i'm sure they all tried
[17:35:48] <miketaylr> CrossX: do you have a page that actually shows this single line HTML?
[17:35:53] <miketaylr> having  a hard time imagining the code
[17:36:57] <CrossX> ummm... not handy, it's part of a large framework.  I can work up an example.  But I'm not confused about the code.
[17:37:20] <CrossX> The RTE is implmeneted by mozilla, not me, so I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel or anything
[17:38:24] <miketaylr> ok, what about an example of this string that's returned?
[17:38:42] <CrossX> When a user designs somthing using the IFRAME RTE, anything designed in the RTE will appear on a single line.  Other code written in 'HTML MODE (a textarea)' contains tabs and \n's so I know it's not stripping the characters, it's just not adding them when a user creates HTML using the RTE.
[17:39:26] <CrossX> I would think it would be an execCommand like "format HTML pretty" or somthing
[17:39:34] <miketaylr> that sounds good!
[17:40:39] <CrossX> Anyone know of a good pastebin that contains a good "This is your code rendered" area?
[17:41:00] <miketaylr> CrossX: here's the closest thing to a spec of designMode: http://aryeh.name/spec/editcommands/editcommands.html
[17:41:23] <miketaylr> actually, you could hop into #whatwg and ask AryehGregor
[17:41:35] <miketaylr> he probably knows as much about that as anyone right now
[17:41:44] <CrossX> I'll try that, thanks mike
[17:42:10] <miketaylr> (if he's around right now, he's usually around during the day)
[17:44:22] <CrossX> miketaylr: I'll try now and again later.  It may be hopless, but I've got to ask people smarter than me before I give up.
[17:45:26] <miketaylr> CrossX: yeah, it's kinda late in the US and Europe right now, so tomorrow earlier is maybe a better bet
[17:50:48] <CrossX> miketaylr: here's a example of my problem: http://www-archive.mozilla.org/editor/midasdemo/
[17:51:11] <CrossX> Make a bulleted list (UL) using the RTE, then click'view HTML source'
[17:51:24] <CrossX> it always appears on a single line, and looks ugly
[17:57:14] <paul_irish> CrossX: you want it formatted?
[17:57:22] <paul_irish> i dont think you're gonna get that bro
[17:57:36] <paul_irish> innerHTML has very little interest in serializing in a prettttty way
[17:57:45] <CrossX> paul_irish: That's what I had concluded, but I had to ask.
[17:57:51] <paul_irish> yUp.
[17:58:20] <_Sorensen> is it.. the legend?
[17:58:23] <_Sorensen> :P
[17:58:27] <CrossX> It's too bad FX impements an RTE (https://developer.mozilla.org/en/rich-text_editing_in_mozilla) but you can't get any good HTML from it.
[17:58:35] <paul_irish> so
[17:58:48] <paul_irish> moz likes to abbv it as "FX" but it kills me
[17:58:54] <paul_irish> because i have called it FF for everrrrr
[17:58:58] <paul_irish> thoughts?
[17:59:00] <CrossX> ya, I like FF too
[17:59:09] <paul_irish> like fx is effects
[17:59:11] <CrossX> but they say FX, so I just do it
[17:59:20] <paul_irish> buy into the hype.
[17:59:25] <CrossX> ya, like it wasn't already taken right?
[17:59:35] <CrossX> and FF is take by?  Friendly fire?
[17:59:47] <paul_irish> fabulous fridays
[17:59:47] <jovrtn> am I accidentally setting this to a global var with this pattern?  var results = []; /* populate array */ results = sort(results);
[17:59:53] <paul_irish> so accidentally
[17:59:58] <jovrtn> er
[18:00:01] <jovrtn> mistakenly
[18:00:02] <jovrtn> :P
[18:00:27] <jovrtn> I just realized I've been doing it subconsciously
[18:00:29] <jovrtn> gah
[18:01:19] <jovrtn> it feels wrong to stick the var in there a second time
[18:01:26] <paul_irish> so wrong
[18:01:54] <paul_irish> var results = []
[18:02:06] <paul_irish> wait
[18:02:07] <paul_irish> waht
[18:02:17] <paul_irish> no this is one varirable
[18:02:29] <paul_irish> you're not indirectly globalling it
[18:02:38] <jovrtn> whew
[18:04:08] <xxiao> $("#mainsPower1").replaceWith(tempDisplay1); I noticed tempDisplay1 is updated, but not replacing #mainDisplay1's text, why
[18:05:22] <xxiao> replacewith only works for the first time?
[18:15:42] <Doulos> Anyone Mind Answering a Jquery Question? I'm having trouble figuring out where to even look for the bug. It seems really straight forward.
[18:16:11] <snover> ?ask @ Doulos
[18:16:11] <bot-t> Doulos, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[18:16:21] <Doulos> function get_icd9_desc($icd9_code, $field_id)
[18:16:21] <Doulos> {

[18:16:36] <Doulos> 	}
[18:16:38] <Doulos> }
[18:16:40] <Doulos> That Empty Command isn't Working.
[18:16:54] <Doulos> the Alert Fires (when un-commented) but the Empty doesn't and I can't figure out why.
[18:17:36] <Mac_Weber> how to disable links which the URI ends with a specific string?
[18:18:05] <snover> Doulos: bro, seriously, do not paste code into the channel
[18:18:37] <snover> ?101 @ Doulos
[18:18:37] <bot-t> Doulos, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[18:20:12] <ejo> I'm doing something wrong with $.unique() and don't quite get it.  I'm paying attention to the docs where it says it can only operate on a native JS array of DOM nodes, and I'm doing as it says.
[18:20:33] <ejo> My case is three identical <tr> nodes, I select them and try $.unique() on them but still get all 3 back.
[18:21:00] <ejo> and by identical I mean they literally are the same html 3x in a row, content and tags and all, character for character
[18:21:17] <snover> ejo: same html is not the same thing as same node
[18:21:31] <ejo> ooh that must be it.  say more
[18:22:05] <snover> a = document.createElement('div'); $.unique([ a, a, a, a, a ]).length -> 1
[18:22:39] <snover> a = document.createElement('div'); $.unique([ a.cloneNode(), a.cloneNode(), a.cloneNode() ]) -> 3
[18:22:45] <ejo> yep
[18:22:47] <ejo> thought so
[18:23:15] <ejo> so $.unique won't help me remove "textually" identical nodes.  I'll just do it myself then, i guess?  any suggestion for something that already exists for that?
[18:23:41] <snover> why do you have duplicate nodes that you are trying to remove?
[18:24:17] <ejo> Oh, I'm letting a user add stuff to a table and want to prevent them from adding duplicate entries.  But I can just check their input before I ever add it, that would be cleaner.
[18:24:25] <ejo> oh well, no free lunch!
[18:40:50] <Mac_Weber> how to select links ending with <void>? I'm trying $('a[href*="\\<void\\>"]') but it's not working
[18:41:02] <Silver1> hi. what could be the reason that .animate() doesn't fire the first time ?
[18:43:21] <snover> Mac_Weber: neither < nor > can be represented in a URL without being encoded
[18:44:15] <Mac_Weber> snover: I got it working. I hade to change it to %3C adn %3E
[18:44:19] <Mac_Weber> had*
[18:49:58] <Silver1> somebody good enough to know?
[18:50:06] <Silver1> what could be the reason that .animate() doesn't fire the first time ?
[18:50:08] <daevski> I need a suggestion for making this ( http://jsfiddle.net/L2zpu/ ) into a hover vs a click. I've tried .hover() .mouseenter()/.mouseleave() and also .mouseenter()/.mouseout(), but I get the box taking on it's own life after hover. Just in-out in-out immediately and repeatedly.
[18:50:43] <daevski> after the mouse hovers * the first time.
[18:58:42] <DaIRC43616> can anyone help me with the following: http://jsfiddle.net/z4haE/
[18:58:47] <DaIRC43616> Notes are in the CSS window
[19:01:12] <Z3R0> gnarf you around?
[19:02:16] <daevski> I need a suggestion for making this ( http://jsfiddle.net/L2zpu/ ) into a hover vs a click. I've tried .hover() .mouseenter()/.mouseleave() and also .mouseenter()/.mouseout(), but I get the box taking on it's own life after the mouse hovers the first time. Just in-out in-out immediately and repeatedly.
[19:03:35] <Z3R0> do you have a demo anywhere?
[19:04:19] <daevski> Z3R0, not of the faulty code, just this working click version.
[19:04:43] <Z3R0> well ya, just wanted to see what's what... easier for me to help debug to actuallly be able to test it
[19:05:45] <ejo> um... why can't I just $(some selector).effect('pulsate');  ?
[19:05:53] <ejo> the selector works, it's picking the right element...
[19:06:05] <ejo> $(same selector).toggle(); works, for instance
[19:06:15] <ejo> what am I blatantly overlooking about effect()
[19:06:53] <ejo> ?
[19:07:29] <daevski> Z3R0, yeah I understand. Don't have one right now though :-\
[19:07:53] <Z3R0> wait daev
[19:07:59] <Z3R0> I assume you changed the .click() to be a .hover() right ?
[19:08:10] <Z3R0> your problem i believe is simple... your IF / ELSE
[19:08:38] <Z3R0> if (left = 330) { // obvious... } but ELSE { == ALL OTHER VALUES } change to else if (left == 15px)
[19:08:50] <daevski> Z3R0, I also tried hover -> slide out and then mouseleave -> slide away... but somehow it thought that it left the box and would slide back away...
[19:08:53] <Z3R0> or -15px
[19:09:14] <ejo> Are the optional parameters to $.effect() actually required?
[19:10:27] <Z3R0> daevski try this http://jsfiddle.net/h5qXS/
[19:10:55] <Z3R0> although that probably won't work either...
[19:11:09] <Z3R0> I dunno tho
[19:11:41] <Mac_Weber> I'm selecting hyperlinks using $('a[href*="%3Cvoid%3E"]') now, how to disable them?
[19:11:51] <daevski> Z3R0, ah right. Not a bad thought. I'm rebuilding it now, so I'll be back in a few mins
[19:12:00] <Z3R0> don't know if that will work though
[19:12:05] <Z3R0> depends on when the css values update
[19:12:13] <Hierofant> hm, bitcoins. hacked.
[19:12:18] <Z3R0> if they update instantly but take a while to get there, then it will still be that value
[19:13:06] <Z3R0> Also if anyone has any ideas why this might happen: http://jsfiddle.net/z4haE/
[19:14:17] <Z3R0> ejo where'd you find doc on .effects?
[19:14:31] <Z3R0> can't seem to find them in the api.jquery.com
[19:14:43] <ejo> Z3R0: figured it out most likely, i probably just didn't include all the effects in my download.  but here's a docs link
[19:14:56] <Z3R0> any ideas on my problem? lolz
[19:14:57] <ejo> oh Z3 you need to be on the jquery-ui docs, different site
[19:15:04] <Z3R0> ah right
[19:15:35] <Z3R0> I'm working with jquery-ui as well... and unfortunately came into a problem
[19:17:44] <jrockjiggz> does anyone know why i'm getting 'is not a function' $('#assignOfficialTemplate').html().clone()
[19:19:39] <ejo> jrockjiggz: have you checked that your selector is working?
[19:19:49] <ejo> and that $('...').html() actually points to anything?
[19:20:01] <jrockjiggz> ejo. good idea ..
[19:20:21] <Z3R0> ejo any thoughts with my prob? lol
[19:20:24] <ejo> and that jquery is properly loaded and no JS syntax errors are keeping the script section of your page from being interrpeted etc etc
[19:20:29] <ejo> z3, what is it?
[19:20:36] <ejo> oh there hang on
[19:20:38] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/z4haE/
[19:20:44] <Z3R0> notes are in the css field
[19:20:52] <daevski> Z3R0, I guess tonight I just am thinking better. Fixed it: http://jsfiddle.net/h5qXS/ -- just made them seperate events instead of a jimmy-rig toggle.
[19:20:56] <jrockjiggz> ejo: yes, i am getting html
[19:21:11] <daevski> Z3R0, they each get an if statement also.
[19:21:14] <ejo> Z3R0: i'm sorry, no idea
[19:21:16] <Z3R0> nice
[19:21:23] <Z3R0> ya, it's really weird... I'm so stumped right now
[19:21:44] <Z3R0> works fine on it's own, but when it's included and already loaded, doesn't work
[19:22:19] <Z3R0> daevski think better toward my prob nbow
[19:24:04] <daevski> Z3R0,  lol kk one min...
[19:24:54] <Z3R0> wait...
[19:25:04] <Z3R0> the HEAD is ran before the page loads right?
[19:25:21] <Z3R0> so if the ID's didn't exist on the page and the header was never reloaded, it's obvious that they wouldn't work right?
[19:26:13] <daevski> That's the right train of thought, yes.
[19:26:19] <Z3R0> uh... but I also tried putting it in the file.html that was loaded into the DIV and unfortunately still nothin
[19:26:21] <daevski> Z3R0,  ^
[19:27:16] <daevski> is it within $(document).ready(function(){ }); ?
[19:27:21] <Z3R0> I'd show you all the files included, but it's a lot because I'm splitting it up before i move to using sql
[19:27:22] <daevski> Z3R0, ^
[19:27:25] <Z3R0> O.o
[19:27:33] <Z3R0> no?
[19:27:38] <Z3R0> on sec
[19:27:40] <Tobsn> hey, if i use jquery template and i add data with $.tmpl( 'template', data ).appendTo(); can i somehow get the data and append it later? var x = $.tmpl( 'template', data ); and than later on x.appendTo(); ?
[19:27:43] <Z3R0> it's about to be
[19:28:09] <daevski> Z3R0, well that will tell it to wait until it's all loaded. So it might help
[19:28:15] <Tobsn> ah nevermind, that actually worked, wrong url.
[19:28:37] <daevski> Tobsn, some people fix their own issues. It's okay.
[19:28:43] <Tobsn> ;)
[19:28:47] <Tobsn> sorry about that
[19:28:51] <Tobsn> i'll try harder next time
[19:29:27] <Z3R0> still no luck
[19:29:30] <Z3R0> my problem is...
[19:29:34] <daevski> Z3R0, darn.
[19:29:40] <Z3R0> HEAD is loaded (but the first file is the index)
[19:29:53] <Z3R0> sub html files are loaded via my loadContent() function aka the "Dashboard"
[19:29:59] <nylinuxhelp> hello all, I have a general jQuery question
[19:30:03] <Z3R0> into my #content div
[19:30:14] <Tobsn> nylinuxhelp, sorry no jquery questions in #jquery
[19:30:22] <Tobsn> ;)
[19:30:24] <Z3R0> which is where #content grid_5 and #content grid_6 // on Dashboard.html
[19:30:28] <daevski> Z3R0, yeah, I don't know the solution, but I know generally what you are talking about. I've been in similar situations.
[19:30:42] <Z3R0> I don't know how to fix it, and it's putting a horrible STALL in my project
[19:30:48] <nylinuxhelp> is there much functional difference between using an IIFE (immediately invoked..) and using $(document.ready).. .etc
[19:31:10] <nylinuxhelp> more to the point, is the use of 1 any better than the other?
[19:31:38] <nylinuxhelp> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/#iife
[19:31:53] <daevski> Z3R0, not that this will help, but try all the <script ...> ... </script> in the bottom of the template page (still within document ready).
[19:32:03] <Z3R0> ah daevski fyi $(function() == $(document).ready()
[19:32:11] <Z3R0> http://api.jquery.com/ready/ // accoridng to this
[19:32:14] <daevski> Z3R0, ah ok
[19:32:28] <Z3R0> hmmm so move all <script> outside the HEAD ?
[19:32:57] <daevski> Z3R0, yeah, it doesn't need to be there.
[19:33:21] <Z3R0> grrrr
[19:33:27] <daevski> Z3R0, I had a whole site with them after </body> not too long ago.
[19:33:49] <Silver1> hey guys, is it unprofessional to show a dev site for debugging?
[19:33:54] <daevski> Z3R0, I'm not an expert though, so don't come chasing me down if I'm wrong lol.
[19:34:00] <Z3R0> lol no worries
[19:34:09] <Z3R0> I'm no prof either lol that's why we all here
[19:34:20] <Z3R0> no luck though...
[19:34:33] <daevski> Silver1, yes. I personally don't share domain info, just jsfiddle links.
[19:34:54] <daevski> Z3R0, k...
[19:35:14] <Z3R0> I'm worried that it's something within the code... I just don't get what it could be
[19:35:36] <daevski> Z3R0, place it back where it works, in the html file.... then you will know.
[19:35:42] <Z3R0> well that's the thing...
[19:35:49] <daevski> if it still works, the code is fine.
[19:35:55] <Z3R0> I can place it anywhere as long as I call the html file directly
[19:36:06] <Z3R0> but the moment I request it and load into a DIV it stops
[19:36:22] <daevski> Okay. That is not an area I know well, so I'm done guessing :)
[19:36:27] <Silver1> i have 3 areas in my page TOP/NAV, CONTENT and FOOTER
[19:36:45] <Mac_Weber> how to replace the href attribute to "javascript: void(0);" ?
[19:37:11] <Z3R0> <a href="javascript:void(0)"> ?
[19:37:29] <tbranyen> Mac_Weber: why do you want to do that?
[19:37:32] <tbranyen> do you want to disable the link?
[19:37:42] <Silver1> the footer doesn't stay in place when i remove the content and load new content. what can i do?
[19:37:44] <Mac_Weber> tbranyen: yes
[19:37:53] <tbranyen> Mac_Weber: bind a click event to it and return false
[19:38:17] <tbranyen> $("a[href=current_href]").bind('click', function() { return false; });
[19:38:27] <Z3R0> on a XMLhttprequest how can I view the request in code rather than it parse?
[19:38:34] <daevski> Silver1, maybe footer css should be 'position: absolute; bottom: 0;' ? or google similar footer stay at bottom code.
[19:38:40] <tbranyen> Z3R0: responseText instead of responseXML ?
[19:38:45] <Z3R0> ah thanks...
[19:38:56] <Z3R0> well....
[19:39:01] <daevski> lol
[19:39:13] <tbranyen> Z3R0: that works with all the jquery ajax methods that return an xhr object
[19:39:22] <tbranyen> make sure you have access to the xhr object
[19:39:26] <Z3R0> wait I'm confused
[19:39:43] <tbranyen> and?
[19:39:50] <Z3R0> how do I get the xhr object?
[19:40:01] <tbranyen> Z3R0: paste your code ?pastie
[19:40:06] <tbranyen> ?pastie
[19:40:07] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[19:40:08] <Z3R0> http.responseText = my html code, but it parses to inner.html
[19:40:12] <ejo> what arguments to onclick handlers receive?
[19:40:14] <ejo> do*
[19:40:22] <tbranyen> ejo: a function
[19:40:29] <tbranyen> click events in jquery get the event object

[19:40:53] <Z3R0> my problem is this tbranyen
[19:40:55] <tbranyen> Z3R0: question... why aren't you using jquery?
[19:41:00] <tbranyen> in a #jquery channel
[19:41:03] <tbranyen> for ajax
[19:41:04] <Z3R0> cuz I'm a copy paste nub?
[19:41:13] <Z3R0> not going to lie...
[19:41:15] <ejo> tbranyen: I just mean in the case of <a href="#foo" onclick="bar()">click me</a>
[19:41:17] <tbranyen> thats not an answer
[19:41:27] <Z3R0> didn't know it wasn't jquery ?
[19:41:28] <tbranyen> ejo: this is #jquery...
[19:41:31] <Silver1> daevski: thanks bro
[19:41:37] <tbranyen> Z3R0: there is no jquery in that
[19:42:15] <Mac_Weber> tbranyen: that did not work for some menus I have links. The strange thing is that it worked on the first click, on the second it followed the link
[19:42:45] <tbranyen> Z3R0: $("#content").load("html/"+page+".html");
[19:42:46] <tbranyen> is jquery
[19:42:49] <tbranyen> to do the exact same thing
[19:43:05] <tbranyen> Mac_Weber: paste your code
[19:43:09] <tbranyen> or do you have a demo i can see
[19:43:41] <Z3R0> omg
[19:43:53] <Z3R0> ya and they don't do the exact same thing for some reason
[19:43:55] <Z3R0> tbranyen I LOVE YOU
[19:44:04] <tbranyen> I love you 2
[19:44:07] <Z3R0> You fixed 2 problems with 1
[19:44:15] <Mac_Weber> tbranyen: http://www.bhpocket.com/new_site the main menu Roteiro, and side bar have void links, you can select them with $('a[href*="%3Cvoid%3E"]')
[19:44:18] <Z3R0> using that js instead of jquery was causing my other script to bork
[19:44:23] <Z3R0> now using the jquery makes it work!
[19:44:42] <Z3R0> Note to Self... if using jquery anywhere else, continue to use jquery everywhere else
[19:44:54] <tbranyen> Mac_Weber: looking
[19:45:08] <Z3R0> plus that is totally smaller...
[19:45:27] <tbranyen> Mac_Weber: they do not have void
[19:45:29] <Z3R0> you are totally my hero today... wow...
[19:45:32] <nylinuxhelp> after reading a bit on benalmans site, he writes that "when the parser encounters the function keyword, it knows to parse it as a function expression and not a function declaration."
[19:45:41] <Z3R0> been struggling with that problem for about 12 hours now
[19:45:47] <nylinuxhelp> and that otherwise, a syntax error occurs
[19:45:50] <Z3R0> all to find out it was because I was a nub
[19:46:02] <tbranyen> nylinuxhelp: that looks very out of context
[19:46:14] <nylinuxhelp> why out of context?
[19:46:17] <tbranyen> when the parser hits function declaration() { } thats a declaration
[19:46:28] <tbranyen> var declaration = function() { } thats an assignment expression
[19:46:40] <tbranyen> the parser hits function both times
[19:46:54] <tbranyen> but just because it hits the function keyword doesn't mean its one or the other
[19:47:02] <Mac_Weber> tbranyen: the Roteiro menu item link is http://www.bhpocket.com/new_site/pt-br/%3Cvoid%3E ending with the string decoded to <void>
[19:47:05] <nylinuxhelp> a few lines above, it reads "because in JavaScript, parens canâ€™t contain statements. "
[19:47:14] <nylinuxhelp> tbranyen, does that make sense?
[19:47:16] <tbranyen> Mac_Weber: oh you mean the base link
[19:47:26] <Mac_Weber> tbranyen: I want to disable all links ending like this
[19:47:52] <Mac_Weber> tbranyen: I cannot get rid of the href attribute or it will mess the style
[19:48:28] <tbranyen> Mac_Weber: ending like what?
[19:48:46] <tbranyen> like %3Cvoid%3E
[19:48:50] <tbranyen> ?
[19:49:16] <Mac_Weber> tbranyen: all ending with the string %3Cvoid%3E, the ones I select with $('a[href*="%3Cvoid%3E"]')
[19:49:42] <nylinuxhelp> has anyone used IIFE before? So far, I can't tell what sets it better than using document.ready(function()
[19:49:45] <tbranyen> Mac_Weber: why aren't you using $=?
[19:50:02] <tbranyen> nylinuxhelp: they aren't the same thing at all
[19:50:06] <tbranyen> keep reading that article
[19:50:19] <nylinuxhelp> ok, thanks tbranyen, at least thats a step in the right direction.
[19:51:06] <nylinuxhelp> i'd like to know more about it, since if they aren't the same there's probably a really good reason it was suggested to be used for some channel help I got a few months ago
[19:51:10] <tbranyen> Mac_Weber: working fine here
[19:51:19] <tbranyen> i'm clicking on Roterio and its not doing anything
[19:51:56] <Mac_Weber> tbranyen: really? on my second click it follows the link
[19:52:10] <tbranyen> ah Mac_Weber that was what i was missing
[19:52:11] <tbranyen> ;-)
[19:52:20] <Z3R0> Does anyone know how sorting works ? if say, I wanted to save and recall the sorted widgets on the screen ?
[19:55:05] <tbranyen> Mac_Weber: i removed all click events with unbind('click')
[19:55:10] <Z3R0> nvm google is my friend
[19:55:11] <tbranyen> then attached a click event that does return false
[19:55:17] <tbranyen> you have some click event thats messing with it
[19:56:19] <tbranyen> Mac_Weber: you are going to combine all those stylesheets right?
[19:57:18] <Mac_Weber> tbranyen: yes, when I put the site on production
[19:57:38] <tbranyen> okay good
[19:58:08] <Mac_Weber> tbranyen: how to use .attr() to change the href to "javascript:void(0)"?

[20:47:58] <coldhead> http://ratemyvomit.com/
[20:55:47] <petafile> I'm executing this code: var myVar = $(myelem).offset();  console.log(myVar);  the 'top' member is totally wrong (a huge negative number) but console.log($(myelem).offset()); works as expected.  What am I doing wrong?
[20:59:53] <coldhead> that's very strange, petafile
[20:59:58] <coldhead> where are you doing this?
[21:00:06] <coldhead> is it inside a $(document).ready() ?
[21:00:35] <petafile> coldhead: in a nested call, but yeah
[21:00:48] <coldhead> and the element is visible?
[21:00:56] <coldhead> can you reproduce this weirdness on jsfiddle?
[21:01:19] <petafile> not familiar with jsfiddle.  The left member is fine though, its just the top member that gets broken
[21:01:45] <coldhead> ?jsfiddle
[21:01:45] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests. These tools allow you to replicate your issue and pres
[21:03:10] <petafile> it seems like the issue is in this line: this.position = this.elem.offset(); because this.position's .top member is wrong.  I figured maybe it was some subtlety of javascript copy constructors I didn't understand
[21:04:08] <coldhead> no that really should just work
[21:04:24] <coldhead> wait, this.position?
[21:04:26] <coldhead> why you do that
[21:04:35] <coldhead> i guess that's a matter for yourself
[21:04:46] <coldhead> i don't care to mess with `this`
[21:05:52] <petafile> The code in question is in a constructor, so I thought that 'this' referred' to the object I was constructing.  Is that not the case?  The object being constructed is not a DOM element
[21:06:13] <coldhead> i don't know
[21:06:22] <coldhead> `this` usually means trouble
[21:06:48] <petafile> gotcha.  I'll pursue that train og debugging
[21:09:04] <coldhead> petafile: jsfiddle is really good if you get stuck, you can easily reproduce and share issues if needed

[21:28:23] <Klevre> How do I bind an event to when a textarea element is being modified?
[21:28:34] <Klevre> change() doesn't seem to get fired
[21:34:43] <Iszak> Klevre, keydown/up events
[21:35:04] <Iszak> Klevre, change does indeed work but it is only executed upon blur and change of the textarea, if you read the documentation you'll see this.
[21:37:24] <glen1> what do you guys use for charts? I checked out google charts but im not sure how to use it with ajax
[21:38:28] <coldhead> if flot does what you need try that
[21:40:22] <glen1> thanks coldhead ill have a gander
[21:40:38] <simoncpu> hi
[21:40:51] <simoncpu> is it possible to unwrap() only a specific tag?
[21:41:14] <simoncpu> i.e., i want to unwrap() an <a> tag outside my <img>, but i don't want to unwrap if itdoesn't exist
[21:41:20] <Tobsn> if i append new elements, can i have them slideDown?
[21:42:57] <coldhead> simoncpu: var a = $('a:has(img)'); if (a.length > 0) a.unwrap();
[21:43:01] <coldhead> something like that?
[21:44:03] <glen1> coldhead, looking at the flot examples some beautiful charts there haha
[21:44:17] <simoncpu> coldhead: uhm... i thought unwrap() removes the parent element?
[21:44:29] <simoncpu> i.e., <a href="#"><img /></a>
[21:44:50] <simoncpu> can i do something like img:hasparent or something?
[21:45:44] <dgouldin> I have a javascript class that needs to bind and trigger events on an instance ... right now it's not directly tied to the dom, but I'm considering binding namespaced events on document or injecting a hidden div to bind events on.  Both feel wrong ... is there a cleaner way to do this?
[21:45:56] <coldhead> Tobsn: $('#foo').append('<div style="display:none">lol</div>').find('div').slideDown()
[21:46:11] <Tobsn> aaah
[21:46:12] <Tobsn> hmm
[21:46:18] <Tobsn> yeah nah
[21:46:27] <Tobsn> its a lot of divs
[21:46:29] <coldhead> no simoncpu, you have to do something like $('img').parents('a').length
[21:46:46] <simoncpu> coldhead: cool, i think that would work
[21:46:47] * simoncpu tries
[21:49:30] <coldhead> dgouldin: i may be misunderstanding your question but could you use ?live
[21:49:30] <bot-t> dgouldin, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[21:50:20] <dgouldin> coldhead: basically, I'm asking if I can use jQuery's events completely independent of the dom
[21:51:23] <coldhead> dgouldin: i'd imagine so because it supports custom events and pseudoevents like hover
[21:51:34] <coldhead> but i'd need to read the source or try it to be sure
[21:51:36] <Iszak> coldhead, hai
[21:51:40] <dgouldin> coldhead: right, but those are still bound on dom elements, yes?
[21:51:45] <coldhead> it's my first day using jquery i'm sorry
[21:51:53] <coldhead> ah yes, dgouldin
[21:52:04] <coldhead> but the elements might not be in the dom
[21:52:15] <coldhead> and do they receive events then?
[21:52:23] <coldhead> tricky :\
[21:52:24] <dgouldin> hmmmm, that's an avenue to try
[21:52:27] <coldhead> hai Iszak
[21:52:44] <Iszak> I'm on my new laptop :D
[21:53:33] <mentaldevils> congrats Iszak! What did you get?
[21:53:41] <Iszak> A Dell XPS 15z
[21:53:46] <dgouldin> coldhead: I'd hoped there was an established best practice here, seems like the natural next step to deferred/promise which work splendidly apart from my ties to the dom
[21:53:47] <Iszak> the Windows of Macbook Pros
[21:54:07] <dgouldin> any ties*
[21:54:43] <mentaldevils> I could use an upgrade, saving up for a Macbook Pro myself, bet that new lappie is nice tho
[21:56:06] <coldhead> i'm too noob to know of such a thing, dgouldin
[21:56:20] <dgouldin> coldhead: I don't buy it ;) but thanks for your help
[21:56:57] <coldhead> i'll try a test case on jsfiddle and you can tell me if i misunderstand
[21:57:05] <b-> Whose dick do I have to suck for a Macbook Pro
[21:57:24] <b-> Steve Jobs, show yourself
[21:57:53] <dgouldin> must ... resist ... "Jobs" jokes
[22:00:09] <etcetera> werent they supposed to make a minor update this wednesday?
[22:01:05] <TuRnc04tZ> b-, i have a mac book pro
[22:01:36] <TuRnc04tZ> the hype is more than the actual product
[22:01:44] <TuRnc04tZ> i enjoy my ubuntu desktop a lot more
[22:02:45] <coldhead> dgouldin: http://jsfiddle.net/ZzWMV/1/
[22:02:51] <b-> TuRnc04tZ, I would never choose a laptop over a desktop - but atheistically it's one of the best laptops on the market IMO
[22:03:15] <coldhead> $('span').trigger('click'); // fails because you can't select detached elements
[22:03:18] <TuRnc04tZ> that much is true
[22:03:26] <TuRnc04tZ> its def the best laptop i've owned
[22:04:14] <dgouldin> coldhead: interesting, thanks
[22:04:41] <Guest7441> there is a way to say $("[href!=...]") ?
[22:04:42] <b-> from the key bounce to the aluminum case, there's not much more I can ask for. Sure, spec-wise there's Falcon Northwest - but Apple just has the whole "design" thing on target
[22:05:17] <dgouldin> this means they must have an internal api for event binding and triggering independent of the dom ... I would like to see it exposed for attachment to arbitrary objects or global events with namespaces
[22:06:11] <Guest7441> I want to say if href is not equal ...
[22:06:21] <coldhead> the jQuery source is pretty readable if you need to see how they do things, dgouldin ... :)
[22:06:47] <coldhead> we might be reinventing the wheel, its probably already exposed
[22:07:18] <dgouldin> if so it's undocumented ... or I'm just bad at reading docs, either is possible
[22:07:26] <coldhead> possibly both!
[22:07:37] <dgouldin> it's true
[22:07:44] <coldhead> its not a common use case is my guess
[22:07:47] <neology> hi.. how do you handle adding and remove data to a paginated data set using jquery? do we need to refresh pagination links every time we append/remove a record using jquery?
[22:07:58] <coldhead> or it may be intentionally undocumented
[22:08:04] <coldhead> in the DO Not Rely sense
[22:08:58] <aminpy_> is it possible to say $("[href != ...]")?
[22:09:00] <neology> when I add a record using jquery, the last record is again displayed on the next page..
[22:09:06] <aminpy_> not equal
[22:09:45] <kontain> Hey guys is something wrong with this line? $(document).ajaxSuccess(function(){
[22:09:45] <kontain> $("#core-loader").fadeOut();
[22:09:45] <kontain> });
[22:09:50] <mentaldevils> Does this help aminpy_ http://forum.jquery.com/topic/negation
[22:09:50] <kontain> It's stopping me script.
[22:10:09] <coldhead> poor aminpy
[22:10:21] <mentaldevils> lol
[22:10:27] <mentaldevils> ask, quit!
[22:10:33] <mentaldevils> it's a new game we play
[22:10:44] <kontain> Hey guys when I input the value in these input fields and press 'send' http://kamranmotors.com/Core/#Transport
[22:10:52] <kontain> It goes back to a homepage.
[22:11:04] <kontain> I checked in Firebug the geocoder var is undefined.
[22:11:22] <dgouldin> coldhead: a quick look at the events source tells me jQuery still relies on browser-specific properties of dom elements for adding and removing event handlers
[22:11:22] <kontain> Looked into the problem...some sort of ajaxSuccess loader is stopping the script to run from that point.
[22:11:29] <kontain> Can you guys help please?
[22:11:41] <dgouldin> coldhead: so the reason your trick works is that even though the element is not *in* the dom, it's still a dom element with an ownerDocument
[22:12:35] <kontain> mentaldevils: Can you help please?
[22:13:51] <mentaldevils> 1sec lemme look
[22:13:53] <coldhead> ah god damn, sorry dgouldin
[22:13:55] <coldhead> at least we know
[22:14:27] <dgouldin> coldhead: yeah, and your solution is better than either of the ones I came up with, so I'm going to use it :)
[22:14:54] <kontain> mentaldevils: the code is in 'cal.js'
[22:18:20] <mentaldevils> kontain: try making geocoder a global
[22:19:02] <kontain> What might be the problem/
[22:19:41] <kontain> mentaldevils: It is global..
[22:20:27] <mentaldevils> You're right looks like it should be good
[22:20:35] <mentaldevils> hold
[22:21:13] <kontain> mentaldevils: The output is in another file, not the same as 'cal.js' that might be the problem?
[22:22:59] <mentaldevils> I'm not sure, I think the globals should be added to the Window object though so I don't think so... unless it's potentially an ordering problem.
[22:24:16] <kontain> mentaldevils: When you input the fields and press send do you see the results are going on top of the adddress bar and returning to the home page.
[22:25:12] <mentaldevils> I'm not sure
[22:25:20] <kontain> mentaldevils: Should I paste this: var geocoder, location1, location2, gDir, price;
[22:25:24] <kontain> in jQuery file?
[22:25:37] <mentaldevils> no
[22:26:02] <mentaldevils> I don't think I'm getting the home page like you say
[22:26:13] <mentaldevils> If I just type nothing and hit send I see the audi
[22:26:22] <kontain> yea, that is the home page..
[22:26:39] <kontain> ru using firebug?
[22:26:47] <mentaldevils> No Chrome
[22:26:55] <mentaldevils> No; Chrome
[22:27:14] <kontain> if (jQuery.browser.msie) {
[22:27:22] <kontain> It's pointing to that..
[22:27:25] <kontain> Wierd
[22:27:50] <sasori> hello, can someone point me to a portal where i can download a .chm format of the latest jquery manual ? :|
[22:28:51] <mentaldevils> I don't think so
[22:29:01] <mentaldevils> oops, nm that last one
[22:29:26] <kontain> so, the script is not working because only one variable, geocoder is not defined..
[22:30:32] <mentaldevils> kontain: where is that jQuery.browser.msie?
[22:30:44] <mentaldevils> kontain: possibly
[22:30:51] <kontain> jQuery.history.js
[22:34:22] <mentaldevils> When I click send I get an error on line 188 of cal.js
[22:35:18] <kontain> mentaldevils: yes, because geocoder is not defined.
[22:37:17] <kontain> mentaldevils: just runed a profile. It's giving me an error on this if (jQuery.browser.msie) {
[22:37:41] <kontain> actually this: // if ((jQuery.browser.msie) && (jQuery.browser.version < 8)) {
[22:37:53] <mentaldevils> what err?
[22:38:23] <kontain> dunno, just runned the profiler. it's stopping on that line..
[22:39:34] <mentaldevils> I wonder if you're running into version issues
[22:40:16] * mentaldevils is taking a smoke break, brb
[22:40:50] <kontain> this is frustrating..
[22:47:35] <mentaldevils> where do you call initialize?
[22:47:57] <mentaldevils> kontain:
[22:48:07] <kontain> sup
[22:48:09] <kontain> hmm
[22:49:19] <kontain> mentaldevils: no where..
[22:49:23] <mentaldevils> :)
[22:49:31] <kontain> That might be the prob?
[22:49:36] <mentaldevils> most def
[22:49:44] <kontain> where am I suppose to call it though?
[22:50:27] <mentaldevils> right after the function would suffice, you may find something better
[22:50:44] <mentaldevils> or at the top would work I think
[22:51:45] <kontain> mentaldevils: I'm calling it..
[22:51:54] <kontain> mentaldevils: in a different file though
[22:52:27] <kontain> <body onload="initialize()">
[22:52:27] <kontain> <form action="#" onsubmit="showLocation(); return false;">
[22:53:08] <kontain> mentaldevils: ^
[22:54:09] <coldhead> if you're usng jQuery you shouldn't be using onload and onsubmit
[22:54:20] <glen1> I need help with traversing this json.http://pastebin.com/dVhmyNMT
[22:54:25] <coldhead> those things are from the 80s
[22:54:53] <mentaldevils> ya I would do that elsewhere... can you verify that it's getting called?
[22:55:03] <kontain> can I ? lol
[22:55:10] <coldhead> what is this, glen1? i don't see json!
[22:55:11] <glen1> Im using the each function, which allows me to print out the numbers (0,1,2,3) but I cant get to the other strings and numbers i.e. (about , 3)
[22:55:23] <kontain> coldhead: maybe can you step in and help me out here?
[22:55:28] <glen1> coldhead, sorry thats just the structure i got from firebug ill give ya the json my bad
[22:55:28] <kontain> coldhead: I just want the output to show up
[22:57:00] <glen1> coldhead, http://pastebin.com/s3MWgBRx
[22:57:25] <glen1> theres the json
[22:57:37] <coldhead> kontain: i haven't been following the problem sorry but i would use something like this http://jsfiddle.net/3yyvk/
[22:57:45] <coldhead> just to simplify debugging and keep all the code together
[22:58:39] <innociv> What's the best textarea wysiwg replacement for bbcode?
[22:59:18] <kontain> coldhead: it works here...www.kamranmotors.com/Core/dist.html
[22:59:24] <innociv> I might just use tinymce bbcode mode
[22:59:42] <kontain> It's just not working when I embed it on to a page. Something is interrupting and it keeps pointing to stupid ajaxLoader..
[22:59:46] <kontain> jQuery
[23:00:32] <mentaldevils> kontain: the body on your page doesn't have the onload=
[23:00:40] <mentaldevils> it doesn't make sense to use that...
[23:00:44] <mentaldevils> initialize somewhere else
[23:00:51] <glen1> coldhead, i think i got it
[23:00:55] <JakeyChan> how to get the child of object created by $() function?
[23:01:24] <kontain> mentaldevils: shall Intilize it in cal.js it self/
[23:01:35] <kontain> oops, i can't.
[23:01:43] <kontain> where else can I initilize it though?
[23:02:07] <mentaldevils> you can initialize anywhere, just make sure to do it
[23:02:17] <mentaldevils> I would use coldhead
[23:02:21] <mentaldevils> 's recommendation
[23:04:04] <roshanpatel27> I'm sorry for just barging in and asking questions, but i had a small question. I have a set of forms on a page with the same class name. each time a form is submitted the click event for the class is executed. In my case,  when i submit one all of them some how get submitted.
[23:04:04] <kontain> Holy shit
[23:04:06] <kontain> It works..
[23:04:59] <mentaldevils> you're welcome
[23:05:08] <sacho> roshanpatel27: events are not bound to a class, they're bound to an element.
[23:05:40] <mentaldevils> kontain: BTW you should have mentioned at first that you had a working version...
[23:05:57] <sacho> roshanpatel27: do you have a test case?
[23:06:05] <kontain> Thanks a lot, mentaldevils coldhead
[23:06:14] <coldhead> happy hacking, kontain
[23:06:22] <kontain> coldhead: your piece of code worked...
[23:06:28] <coldhead> glen1: you all good?
[23:06:33] <roshanpatel27> sure sacho, once sec, i'll upload the code and the results
[23:06:39] <kontain> coldhead: I pasted from jfiddle to my jS file ... and it wokred!
[23:06:44] <kontain> coldhead: What was the problem here?
[23:07:13] <coldhead> kontain: jQuery tends to work best when you avoid inline JS of the onchange/onload/onsubmit forms
[23:07:30] <glen1> coldhead, yeah man silly json mistake, thanks though for checking up :D
[23:07:37] <coldhead> it encourages separation of js/html
[23:07:49] <coldhead> and that makes it easier to debug anyway, in gerneal
[23:07:52] <coldhead> general*
[23:08:13] <coldhead> also if you are on my team and you do <a href="javascript:..."> you lose a testicle
[23:08:16] <coldhead> harsh but fair
[23:11:53] <mentaldevils> coldhead: you have to learn somehow
[23:12:02] <mentaldevils> n1
[23:13:34] <roshanpatel27> http://jsfiddle.net/Acs9g/  there you sacho. thank you for the help btw
[23:15:11] <roshanpatel27> everytime i click the change port status button. i see ajax on action beneath each of the forms. i don't want it to execute three times, one for each form. i only want it executed once for the form associated with the button click.
[23:16:42] <coldhead> roshanpatel27: i don
[23:16:50] <coldhead> i don't think it is submitting repeatedly
[23:16:58] <coldhead> i think it's just submitting the one form
[23:17:06] <coldhead> but the message it does on success?
[23:17:10] <coldhead> $('.hello')
[23:17:19] <coldhead> that matches severeal elements
[23:17:35] <coldhead> $(this).parent('form'),find('.hello').html(
[23:17:42] <coldhead> something like that might work better
[23:17:53] <coldhead> $(this).parent('form').find('.hello').html(
[23:18:22] <roshanpatel27> omg coldhead, thank you so much.... ...i would've been stuck on that problem all day. i'll try your solution
[23:18:38] <coldhead> roshanpatel27: http://jsfiddle.net/Acs9g/2/
[23:18:44] <coldhead> that might be an even better way
[23:18:47] <coldhead> it's cleaner anyway
[23:19:05] <coldhead> sorry: http://jsfiddle.net/Acs9g/3/
[23:19:27] <alystair> can animation stepping modify the animated object itself?
[23:19:39] <alystair> eg. applying quasai gravity
[23:19:40] <roshanpatel27> a lot cleaner, thank you! i'll try out the solution :)
[23:20:16] <alystair> eg. doing a recalculation of the movement per step, maybe it's not complex enough
[23:20:55] <roshanpatel27> worked like a charm, thank you coldhead
[23:21:01] <coldhead> alystair: you might have to Try It And See. if you have a look at some of the easing effects in easing.js, they might give you some ideas?
[23:21:11] <coldhead> no problem, roshanpatel27
[23:26:47] <kontain> coldhead: When a user press 'send' w/o entering the fields. I want it to say "Fields are empty"
[23:29:07] <coldhead> $('#send').click(function () { $('input').each(function () { if ($(this).val() == '') { alert("Fields are empty"); return false;}})});
[23:29:12] <coldhead> something like that
[23:29:20] <coldhead> except tested and better, obviously
[23:34:45] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/RkkPq/
[23:39:13] <alystair> modifying fx.elem.### doesn't seem to work at all
[23:40:58] <wroos> Hi. I am using  .fadeToggle() to switch between two images in a gallery, but when i hover the image it blinks before It switches if i am using something other than .fadeToggle(0). How can I fix this?
[23:43:01] <wroos> Anyone?
[23:43:40] <kontain> coldhead:
[23:43:45] <coldhead> wroos: if you want to crossfade between two images you generally need them to be absolutely positioned together in a relative container
[23:43:54] <coldhead> so that they are on top of each other
[23:44:09] <kontain> coldhead: Click 'send' now. It shows the error but the "loading string' pops up.
[23:44:23] <coldhead> link?
[23:44:30] <kontain> http://kamranmotors.com/Core/#Transport
[23:44:37] <kontain> Your code on jsFiddle did not work.
[23:44:50] <alystair> augh even modifying the css variables that are animating directly don't affect it at all :|
[23:44:52] <wroos> coldhead: Ah, position: relative; left: 0px; maybe?
[23:44:54] <coldhead> it worked for me
[23:45:05] <kontain> It worked on the jSfiddle, yes.
[23:45:08] <kontain> but not on my jS
[23:45:19] <alystair> anyone here know how to change the variable used during animation in the steps?
[23:45:29] <alystair> so I can change the number in each step on the fly?
[23:45:52] <coldhead> wroos: div {position:relative;} div > img {position:absolute;top:0;left:0}
[23:46:07] <coldhead> might have to mess with it in in firebug to find the magic combo
[23:47:28] <coldhead> kontain: you don
[23:47:40] <coldhead> 't seem to have any <input>s
[23:47:51] <coldhead> or a button with the ID of "send"
[23:47:56] <coldhead> which is what my code works with
[23:48:02] <kontain> 		<input type="submit" id="send" value="Send" />
[23:48:20] <coldhead> oh good :)
[23:48:25] <kontain> It has that..
[23:48:34] <kontain> Um... am I putting your code after something
[23:48:34] <coldhead> i don't see that on the page you linked
[23:49:04] <coldhead> view-source:http://kamranmotors.com/Core/#Transport
[23:49:10] <coldhead> that has no #send
[23:49:30] <wroos> coldhead: can I realy have position: absolute in a gallery? Don't they all get the same position then? So it was for me anyway.
[23:49:59] <kontain> coldhead: I don't even see code for input/output boxes..
[23:50:02] <kontain> lol
[23:50:29] <coldhead> depends on the gallery, wroos, but if you want two images to crossfade you need them absolutely positined in the same place
[23:50:58] <wroos> coldhead: Okay.
[23:50:58] <coldhead> wroos: you could wrap pairs of absolutely positioned images in relatively positioned containers
[23:51:03] <coldhead> if you want lots
[23:51:35] <coldhead> kontain: the code i wrote needs to be in a $(document).ready() wrapper
[23:51:48] <coldhead> that's assumed for most jQuery, sorry
[23:51:53] <wroos> Have lots of images and i dont want a css class for each picture.
[23:52:18] <coldhead> pastebin your html maybe, wroos
[23:52:24] <coldhead> there are too many possibilitieis
[23:52:29] <coldhead> possibilities*
[23:52:39] <kontain> coldhead: It has another code sitting there. Look at 'cal.js'
[23:52:40] <wroos> http://paste2.org/p/1475994
[23:54:15] <coldhead> kontain: if you're adding the inputs and the button later you might need to use lice()
[23:54:19] <coldhead> live()
[23:54:20] <coldhead> lol
[23:54:23] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/RkkPq/1/
[23:54:27] <coldhead> something like that
[23:54:28] <alystair> what is the variable to modify in a 'step' of an animation to change its next step?
[23:54:32] <cybin> hi
[23:55:15] <coldhead> wroos: div.fade {position:relative;} div.fade img {position:absolute;top:0;left:0}
[23:55:19] <coldhead> that should work
[23:55:44] <coldhead> alystair: i don't think any of the fx wizards are awake at the moment
[23:55:50] <kontain> coldhead: LOL it works but check click on it now
[23:55:55] <kontain> coldhead: It has two windows!
[23:55:56] <kontain> lol
[23:56:11] <wroos> I have tryed that with no success. :S
[23:56:22] <coldhead> alystair: you might get better results if you post to forum.jquery.com or give a couple of hours for the US to wakeup >:\
[23:56:28] <alystair> augh
[23:56:31] <kontain> and 'Loading string' is still there
[23:56:31] <coldhead> sorry
[23:56:33] * alystair bothers the lords @ -dev
[23:57:12] <cybin> within a plugin initialisation I'm adding a button to the current page. I want to assign a method of the current instance of the plugin to this button, but nothing seem to work. Tried to set on append() with the onclick attribute and with $('mybutton').click(this.mymethod). any ideas on how to do that?
[23:57:24] <coldhead> looks like you need to do some debugging, kontain! good luck
