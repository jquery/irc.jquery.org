[00:24:58] <retsie> hi, I've got a select box and on value change I'd like to trigger an ajax POST to a function I have.
[00:24:59] <retsie> http://pastebin.com/ihauTY9B
[00:25:09] <retsie> this is my code, for some reason nothing happens when I change values. What am I doing wrong?
[00:26:00] <retsie> http://pastebin.com/wdJr9y3P <- thats the correct one
[00:33:25] <retsie> anyone?
[00:33:34] <retsie> and can I even use data: $(this).val()?
[00:47:30] <retsie> ok, I sorted that problem out. Now I'm kind of stumped as to what I do next. I managed to POST a value to a file, but how do I use the information now?
[01:54:00] <retsie> Made some progress, but now my data response from ajax is the entire html code
[01:54:01] <retsie> http://pastebin.com/GmsTLFhR
[01:54:18] <retsie> I only want part of the response
[01:54:26] <retsie> the relevant form field values
[02:13:34] <jop008> within this code I loose my formatting and my numeric field collapsed http://pastebin.com/G03sMHk7
[02:27:51] <jop008> within this code I loose my formatting and my numeric field collapsed http://pastebin.com/G03sMHk7
[02:28:06] <jop008> any idea why?
[02:29:02] <jop008> the content is attaced on the fly using this constuct <div data-type="number"  data-min="" data-max="" data-val=''
[02:29:03] <jop008>                  data-label="Bent u eigenaar en heeft u meerdere objecten vul dan ook het object nummer in:" data-id="objectID"></div>
[02:29:33] <jop008> A routine transforms this to <input type = number or spinbox depending on the browser
[02:31:03] <jop008> When I submit my form jquery destroys my formatting on the numeric field
[02:59:46] <bigbugjava>  Hi, I have a page the has Parallax Scrolling, on a part of him (map) I want to add a fixed right menu, to add some google directions in there.. any ideas on how?
[03:00:45] <paulens12> bigbugjava: position:fixed?
[03:01:42] <bigbugjava> paulens12 thats the problem, I want it only in a part of the page
[03:01:53] <paulens12> oh...
[03:01:58] <bigbugjava> the issue is, for you to understand me better
[03:02:00] <paulens12> make it hidden when you reach certain part
[03:02:25] <bigbugjava> the map is taking 940px, and I need map to be big, now directions will take more space, so I want it out of the orginal container
[03:03:08] <bigbugjava> umm, maybe I can just push it with margin, sec
[03:27:03] <jop008> I have this code http://pastebin.com/L4ks0Jqv oel points to <div id="msg"></div> when I debug the routine my message is visible. When I don't debug no message is displayed
[03:28:15] <jop008> Something with timing?
[03:29:46] <filipiz> jop008: probably you are running your function before the DOM is ready... when you debug you run after the DomReady event
[03:30:33] <jop008> so my showmsg routine must be in document.ready
[03:30:59] <filipiz> yup
[03:33:17] <jop008> then I have not defined but I have 2 docuemnet ready functions
[03:37:38] <jop008> In my generic code included in all pages I have document.ready stuff I put showmsg in it
[03:38:09] <jop008> On my login page I refer to showmsg and it is undefined
[03:38:51] <jop008> The login page has this   $(document).on('imReady', function() {  imready is set by the generic code
[03:42:36] <lng> Hi! Why does line #15 produce 'Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string' here: http://pastebin.com/XgGam9KW
[03:50:26] <jop008> So I have one document.ready where showmsg is defined at the end of document.ready I do $(document).triggerHandler("imReady"); on the other page I do this   $(document).on('imReady', function() {     console.log ( showmsg ); and showmsg is undefined
[03:54:47] <bigbugjava> jop008 need to set it as global var, outside of any fucntions
[03:55:01] <bigbugjava> jop008 var is alive only within he's function
[03:55:26] <jop008> so what must become global?
[03:55:36] <jop008> which var?
[03:56:31] <bigbugjava> var whatever;
[03:56:43] <bigbugjava> in function -> whatever = $(document).triggerHandler("imReady")
[03:56:51] <bigbugjava> if I understand your needs right
[03:57:44] <jop008> and how to handle whatever on the other html page?
[03:58:21] <jop008> Must I built a loop routine to wait?
[03:59:01] <bigbugjava> u already got the element inside a global var, why you need it back on html?
[03:59:06] <bigbugjava> and if so.. just append it right back
[03:59:36] <jop008> I need to fire a showmsg routine
[04:00:13] <jop008> The showmsg routine sits in a generic library file with all kind of general code
[04:00:22] <jop008> showmsg is used on multiple pages
[04:00:28] <bigbugjava> then append it to the right place
[04:00:39] <bigbugjava> look at jquery append
[04:00:54] <jop008> append I now of couse
[04:01:24] <jop008> showmsg is a function not a html chunck directly
[04:02:06] <jop008> The showmsg routine does this <div id=msg> som message </div>
[04:02:18] <jop008> some message is set by showmsg
[04:02:30] <bigbugjava> still dont see the problem
[04:02:47] <bigbugjava> and if it's a object, your can always parse,stringfly and such
[04:02:55] <jop008> showmsg is undefined on my page when I do a submit on a form
[04:03:27] <jop008> No not correct showmsg is defined well but the message is inviisible
[04:03:43] <bigbugjava> umm maybe now I understand your
[04:03:44] <jop008> so oel.show () is not doing its job
[04:03:45] <bigbugjava> you
[04:03:56] <bigbugjava> it's an input?
[04:03:59] <bigbugjava> $("#myForm").serializeArray() ?
[04:04:19] <jop008> No the message is wrong input do thisâ€¦..
[04:04:36] <bigbugjava> sry, cant figure it out.
[04:04:38] <jop008> ad it must become in <div id=msg handled by a generic routine
[04:04:44] <jop008> default is hidden
[04:04:45] <rgb247> anyone can tell me how can I get the percentage status of an $.ajax get request?
[04:04:59] <jop008> so showmsg does oel.show()
[04:05:22] <bigbugjava> then change display to block, ohhhh cant understand
[04:05:23] <bigbugjava> lol
[04:05:30] <bigbugjava> g2g mate, sry
[04:06:26] <jop008> but the message must be shown only after a submit
[04:06:30] <jop008> not always
[04:22:26] <jop008> This is seen in the debugger [
[04:22:26] <jop008> <div id=â€‹"msg" class=â€‹"divinfo" style=â€‹"display:â€‹ block;â€‹">â€‹Verkeerde combinatie van username of password of object nummerâ€‹</div>â€‹
[04:22:27] <jop008> ]
[04:22:36] <jop008> on screen I can't shee the msg
[04:22:42] <jop008> it is blank
[04:26:36] <rgb247>   /j http
[04:40:45] <lng> How to replace by id a tr? is it .html()?
[04:42:02] <systemfault> ?
[04:42:28] <systemfault> .html() is to get/replace fragments of HTML
[04:42:52] <lng> systemfault: that's what I need
[04:43:28] <systemfault> Depends... you might want .replaceWith... it depends on the case.
[04:43:37] <jop008> So in debug mode I do oel and I see the content of <div id=msg but it is not on the screen I tried trigger.create
[04:43:42] <jop008> but no success
[04:44:27] <systemfault> jop008: You probably have a CSS issue... it would be difficult for us to fix it without seeing it :(
[04:44:58] <jop008> I tried a fiddle but failed
[04:45:20] <systemfault> Is the actual website accessible for us?
[04:46:20] <jop008> this is the element div id="msg" style="display:none">&nbsp;</div>
[04:46:29] <jop008> so no css involved
[04:46:48] <systemfault> What is your jQuery code then?
[04:46:50] <jop008> the content of &nbsp; is replaced I can see in the debugger
[04:47:04] <jop008> to display the message?
[04:47:07] <systemfault> paste it on jsfiddle
[04:47:14] <systemfault> Yeah, the only removing the display: none
[04:47:20] <systemfault> s/only/one
[04:48:14] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/ARuxp/101/
[04:48:22] <jop008> see showmsg routine
[04:49:44] <systemfault> There's no "showmsg" routine on that page.
[04:49:54] <systemfault> It's a ajax call...
[04:50:28] <systemfault> And "#msg" is nowhere in that code.
[04:51:12] <systemfault> Hmm.. could be a jqmobile thing... I've never used it.
[04:52:23] <jop008> In the fiddle wo problems http://jsfiddle.net/ARuxp/109/
[04:54:50] <jop008> So where to look for in a fiddle it works fine but not in my code
[05:01:34] <jop008> any suggestions why my div is not updated onthe screen?
[05:01:42] <rgb247> is possible to get the amount of transfered bytes between client and server in a http request made using ajax?
[05:01:50] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/ARuxp/109/
[05:19:32] <jop008> is there a way to force refresh a div element?
[05:39:00] <jop008> Can someone explain this ? oel[0]
[05:39:00] <jop008> <div id=â€‹"msg" class=â€‹"divinfo" style=â€‹"display:â€‹block;â€‹">â€‹Verkeerde combinatie van username of password of object nummerâ€‹</div>â€‹
[05:39:01] <jop008> $("#msg")
[05:39:02] <jop008> [
[05:39:03] <jop008> <div id=â€‹"msg" class=â€‹"divinfo" style=â€‹"display:â€‹block;â€‹">â€‹&nbsp;â€‹</div>â€‹
[05:39:41] <jop008> So one element having 2 values
[05:39:52] <jop008> msg is the dom element

[06:18:28] <Bloomberg> I have this for autocomplete search!
[06:34:20] <jop008> after a form submit I want to update my div with some value it won't let me
[06:36:42] <jost> jop008: code?
[06:37:58] <jop008> http://pastebin.com/surpg3Cq
[06:38:03] <jop008> look at #msg
[06:38:23] <jop008> I want to set it with bad combination of username/password
[06:38:40] <jop008> after the login form submit
[06:38:53] <jop008> at the end you see some code that works fine
[06:39:06] <jop008> after the submit it is vanished
[06:40:33] <jop008> I am working a whole day on this :-(
[06:42:49] <jost> jop008: in line115, you replace the #msg-div by a jQuery not being a div. So it vanishes. Try to replace line 115 by "$('#msg').text('Verkeerde combinatie van username of password of object nummer');"
[06:48:42] <jop008> not working tried it before
[06:48:58] <jop008> the code you saw was found by google

[07:33:17] <Cooke> Hi there, I'm learning JavaScript/jQuery now and I have a question. http://dev.arethus.com/ is my playground and I am currently using an anchor tag for the button. I saw some people use the span tag, use CSS to do a cursor effect, and use that instead of an anchor tag. What is best to use in my situation? Thanks.

[07:35:15] <dfoolz> <Item word="óuò&gt;ó/uò">greater than or equal to</Item>

[07:35:48] <dfoolz> no the ajax request, but that doesn't
[07:35:51] <dfoolz> make a difference
[07:40:37] <rgb247> anyone can tell me if it's possible to get the current transfered amount of bytes in a HTTP request made using ajax?
[07:52:11] <semanty> hi, i use the height () to dynamically set up the height, but it fail, how to improve?
[07:52:13] <semanty> http://paste.ubuntu.com/6388578/
[07:59:39] <malibu> Hi there.. what is the recommended way to past example code on this channel?
[08:00:07] <semanty> malibu: like solution = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea(), )
[08:00:11] <semanty> sorry
[08:00:19] <semanty> malibu: like http://paste.ubuntu.com/6388578/
[08:00:19] <malibu> np
[08:00:45] <semanty> malibu: do you mean this way?
[08:00:56] <malibu> yes
[08:01:28] <malibu> I guess I will use that
[08:01:31] <Velveeta> ideally you'll create a working demo of the code in question on jsfiddle or something
[08:01:46] <Velveeta> but you can also use any generic paste site like pastebin or whatever
[08:01:59] <malibu> I'm asking a question about nested accordions.. will that work in jsfiddle?
[08:02:13] <Velveeta> it should, yes
[08:02:29] <malibu> I'll try it
[08:02:30] <semanty> hi, any one can help http://paste.ubuntu.com/6388578/  why is the height can not be set up as wanted?
[08:02:30] <Velveeta> you'll just have to make sure you tell it to load jquery and jquery ui
[08:02:38] <malibu> ok
[08:04:16] <Velveeta> semanty: you might want to try not only setting its height, but also setting its overflow property to something like hidden, if you're trying to hide the rest of the content below that form
[08:04:21] <malibu> I don't see Jquery UI in the pulldown list
[08:04:49] <Velveeta> malibu: you can add it as an external reference, just supply a url to the actual jquery ui minified file off of google's cdn or something
[08:05:00] <malibu> yeah, gotcha
[08:05:01] <semanty> Velveeta: i did set the overflow preperty, i now found the height i set 10px is too little
[08:05:44] <Velveeta> semanty: ok, so did you get it all sorted then?
[08:06:30] <semanty> Velveeta: yes, i set the digit to 50, it is OK now
[08:06:41] <semanty> Velveeta: var wrapper_height = form_height + input_height + 50;
[08:07:09] <Velveeta> ok good
[08:09:20] <malibu> I figured out my answer while working on the jsfiddle.  :-D
[08:09:28] <Velveeta> heheheh
[08:10:45] <malibu> My inner accordon wasn't being sized correctly according to viewport, but I forgot I wrapped it in a div, which was not being reset by my code.
[08:11:11] <Velveeta> you know what i would do in that situation?
[08:11:18] <Velveeta> reset that div by code
[08:12:02] <malibu> Actually I removed the div.. I think I only needed it to fix earlier incorrectness
[08:12:10] <Velveeta> i meant remove the div!
[08:12:16] <malibu> Lol
[08:12:18] <Velveeta> yeah! same solution!
[08:12:20] <Velveeta> :D
[08:12:52] <malibu> Thank you Velveeta.  As always, you are a pillar of wisdom.
[08:13:12] * Velveeta tips his hat.
[08:15:53] <semanty> Velveeta: strange, failed again
[08:17:00] <Velveeta> semanty: put up an example on jsfiddle so we can see it in action
[08:18:40] <malibu> Ok simpler question
[08:19:04] <malibu> How would i go about overriding the CSS for my inner accordion but not the outer?
[08:19:22] <malibu> I guess I would reference the div ID for the inner
[08:19:24] <malibu> thanks
[08:20:36] <semanty> Velveeta:
[08:20:40] <semanty> Velveeta: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6388758/
[08:23:01] <Velveeta> semanty: i've seen the paste you put up, but i said a jsfiddle, one that we can actually interact with to see what's going wrong from your expected behavior
[08:23:25] <Velveeta> malibu: man, i'm just answering all kinds of things for you today by proxy, huh
[08:23:46] <malibu> It's those brainwaves you're sending through IRC
[08:24:16] <Velveeta> malibu: although i'd probably reference soemthing like #outerId .ui-accordion .ui-accordion
[08:24:36] <Velveeta> that'll catch nested accordions without using a specific id to reference an inner one
[08:24:45] <Velveeta> i'm not a big fan of tying styles to id's vs classes
[08:25:37] <zim> Has anyone produced a cheat sheet for artisan what I am after is all the --fields="option" i.e name:string:nullable
[08:26:35] <malibu> Velveeta: Yeah I always end up using IDs for some reason
[08:26:45] <zim> Velveeta: +1 my css is 100% class based
[08:27:18] <zim> and less is you friend :-)
[08:27:39] <Velveeta> zim: i'm not sure what that artisan thing is, but if you can show me a concrete example of what you're talking about, i might be able to help
[08:28:21] <malibu> Actually you might be able to help with this.. As I said, I have nested accordions.  The parent accordion has two sections, and the child accordion is in the second section of the parent.  How would I remove the padding from the second parent accordion section only?
[08:29:19] <zim> I am using Mr Ways Generators. If you don't know them https://github.com/JeffreyWay/Laravel-4-Generators#resources
[08:29:39] <semanty> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/mVa7W/
[08:30:06] <Velveeta> malibu: is it exactly 2 sections, or is it the 2nd section out of N sections?
[08:30:38] <Velveeta> zim: is this a php question or a js question?
[08:30:44] <zim> What I am after is a cheatsheet of all the DB options i.e. name:string, integer:nullable etc
[08:31:02] <Velveeta> semanty: are are you trying to make the form just big enough to show the text input, or something else?
[08:31:10] <zim> Shit sorry wrong channel.
[08:31:10] <malibu> The accordions are both exactly two sections, with the child in the second section of the parent.
[08:31:12] <Velveeta> semanty: er rather the form wrapper, that div
[08:31:17] <Velveeta> zim: heheheh no problem :)
[08:31:21] <semanty> Velveeta: yes
[08:31:33] <oste> anyone familiar with plugins built using jquery widget pattern?
[08:31:47] <Velveeta> malibu: you can try the adjacent sibling selector, let me see if that'll work in this case given the accordion semantic structure
[08:31:59] <semanty> Velveeta: as the content form can not be fixed, i have to set it dynamically, and i hope on the right, the paper note can be shown
[08:32:28] <semanty> Velveeta: ususally the papernote shall be small, i have not considered if it is higher than the form
[08:32:57] <oste> i might be trying to do the impossible - but I am using create.js
[08:33:23] <Velveeta> malibu: so you can do it this way, but that's kind of ugly: ".ui-accordion .ui-accordion .ui-accordion-header + .ui-accordion-content + .ui-accordion-header + .ui-accordion-content"
[08:33:28] <oste> it is used like $('body').midgardCreate({});
[08:33:33] <oste> this calls another widget here https://github.com/bergie/create/blob/master/dist/create.js#L401-L403
[08:33:46] <oste> midgardToolbar
[08:34:12] <Velveeta> oste: gimme just a minute and i'll be w/ you on that question, my entire day job is built around the widget factory :)
[08:34:12] <oste> this has options that can be seen here https://github.com/bergie/create/blob/master/dist/create.js#L2245-L2251
[08:34:26] <oste> ah cool Velveeta
[08:34:34] <malibu> Velveeta: I was thinking more along the lines of putting a class on the second div of the accordion and overriding the padding to 0 in a later css file
[08:34:57] <oste> trouble is - it gets instantiated when calling midgardCreate() - how can I modify the options???
[08:34:57] <malibu> Velveeta: But I haven't exactly got that to work yet.  Maybe it won't
[08:35:00] <oste> if that makes sense
[08:35:54] <Velveeta> malibu: that would also work, yes
[08:35:59] <Velveeta> or at least it *should*
[08:37:26] <malibu> I'm going to have to do a few overrides anyway.  The inner accordion header will need a different color.
[08:40:10] <malibu> Velveeta: Hmm.. jquery seems to totally override the classes with it's own
[08:40:26] <malibu> When I open the accordion in firebug my class isn't there
[08:41:35] <Velveeta> ok semanty, back with a question for you
[08:41:49] <semanty> Velveeta: hi, what question
[08:43:02] <Velveeta> semanty: so when i open this up, it's calculating the height properly for what it's being told to calculate, which is the form itself, which includes all of those form elements
[08:43:52] <Velveeta> so am i correct in thinking that you want the whole form to be shown, but not the papernote section?
[08:44:14] <semanty> Velveeta: i want the papernote section on the right
[08:44:23] <Velveeta> ok gotcha
[08:45:56] <Velveeta> ok, so part of your problem is that you're wrapping each of those form elements in a p tag, which is block-level
[08:46:05] <Velveeta> so there's no space to the right for you to float that papernote element
[08:48:07] <semanty> Velveeta: so i have to change as non block level?
[08:48:07] <Velveeta> malibu: i'm not sure if jquery overrides or adds to existing classes, but if it's overriding them, then you may want to try the css route i putâ€¦ depending on the browser support you need, you can shorten that whole line of css selector using nth-child or something
[08:48:53] <malibu> Velveeta: It helps if I put the class on the right accordion
[08:49:16] <Velveeta> semanty: you can use <br/> or something between those elements, or else wrap the form in a div with a set width, floated left, and make your papernote element outside of that div, with a set width, floated right
[08:49:21] <Velveeta> malibu: lol
[08:49:36] <Velveeta> ok oste, i think i can get to you now, let me scroll back and read what you posted
[08:49:48] <oste> sweet
[08:50:04] <oste> basically just trying to change options of a widget that is instantiated in another widget
[08:50:09] <KeyboardNotFound> Please reccomend me good open source library for charts ?
[08:51:15] <Velveeta> oste: no problem, when it instantiates that other widget, that widget will be binding its own data to the element it's instantiated on, you can call that widget directly and access its option method to change its options
[08:51:50] <Velveeta> so if $('body') calls the midgardCreate() widget, and that calls the create() widget on body also, you should be able to do $('body').create('option', optionName, value)
[08:52:36] <Velveeta> keyboardnotfound: i've used flot in the past, but it was a long time agoâ€¦ we use highcharts at my company, but we pay for it.. i'm not sure if that's required everyone, or commercial use only, or whatever
[08:52:48] <Velveeta> but it's not open sourced i don't think
[08:52:51] <oste> Velveeta let me try that
[08:52:55] <malibu> Velveeta: Yeah my way doesn't work.. the class is there but the padding value still gets overridden
[08:52:58] <oste> fusion charts too...
[08:53:02] <KeyboardNotFound> Velveeta, thanks
[08:53:18] <oste> think they have an OS version
[08:53:20] <Velveeta> malibu: try adding more specificity to override its own css rule
[08:53:35] <Velveeta> malibu: if you use your id selector and your class name, that should do the trick
[08:53:41] <Velveeta> keyboardnotfound: no problemo
[08:53:59] <malibu> pl
[08:54:02] <malibu> Velveeta: ok
[08:58:16] <deanrock0> is there a method to unset something I set with el.css('','') ?
[08:58:42] <raj> could someone show me the coding style in which this is done in a jquery plugin? `$('#selector').myPlugin({'some':'options for initialization'})`, and later I can do `$('#selector').myPlugin('doSomething')` to run some function in myPlugin. Collecting the object during initialization is no problem, but I'm wondering how the `doSomething` function should be executed in myPlugin from the string that's passed
[08:58:52] <Velveeta> deanrock0: do you want to unset a specific property, or clear all of those properties?
[08:59:34] <Velveeta> raj: have you looked into using the jquery ui widget factory? it's designed specifically for that type of interface
[08:59:35] <oste> Velveeta - this is not working for me jQuery('body').midgardToolbar('option', 'toolcontainer', 'test');
[08:59:36] <oste> :(
[08:59:54] <Velveeta> oste: is there a url where i can see this in action?
[09:00:18] <oste> hrm - not really just local for now
[09:00:36] <oste> before that line i do - jQuery('body').midgardCreate({});
[09:00:41] <deanrock0> hmm, what exactly does .css do? I have an element that has style="min-width:100px" and I wan't to set min-width to auto
[09:00:41] <Velveeta> ok let me take a quick look at that widget that's instantiating the other one
[09:00:51] <raj> Velveeta, what do you mean?
[09:00:59] <raj> I'm writing a plugin
[09:01:20] <Velveeta> deanrock0: .css modifies the style attribute on the element in question, so you should be able to do $(elem).css('min-height', 'auto') if that's all you're trying to do
[09:01:22] <oste> Velveeta check here https://github.com/bergie/create/blob/master/dist/create.js#L401-L403
[09:01:35] <oste> seems the options are already set there
[09:01:43] <deanrock0> Velveeta: min-height: 10px works, but min-height: auto doesn't
[09:02:03] <malibu> Velveeta: Thanks that worked.  and you just taught me a valuable css lesson
[09:02:19] <Velveeta> malibu: woo hoo!
[09:02:23] <oste> https://github.com/bergie/create/blob/master/dist/create.js#L2244
[09:02:29] <oste> that is the line where the second widget starts
[09:03:30] <Velveeta> oste: and which widget are you wanting to modify the options of?
[09:03:33] <oste> should be able to do this right http://pastie.org/8468116
[09:03:48] <malibu> Velveeta: I knew about specificity before, but I've never applied it until now
[09:03:52] <oste> midgardToolbar
[09:04:19] <Velveeta> malibu: yeah, i have to break bad dev habits from time to time on my own team when i see people using !important to override some other css.. specificity is always better when it's an option :)
[09:04:26] <oste> !important > # > . > elment
[09:04:48] <oste> pretty sure # = 100
[09:04:50] <oste> . = 10
[09:04:53] <oste> element = 1
[09:05:06] <oste> #test .another span
[09:05:11] <oste> would be 111
[09:05:21] <malibu> Velveeta: now I think I need that inner DIV back.  the inner accordion is sizing to the outer container
[09:05:39] <raj> mar shoky?
[09:05:43] <Velveeta> oste: ok, so first problem is that there's no option in that widget for 'toolcontainer', that option is nested under an object called templates
[09:05:54] <oste> ah crap
[09:06:01] <oste> how to handle that?
[09:06:15] <oste> doh, should have noticed that my bad
[09:07:13] <Velveeta> so, one thing you can do is get $('body').midgardToolbar('option'), and that'll return you the full options object, then you can overwrite its templates.toolcontainer and reapply that back to the option method's "templates" option
[09:07:35] <Velveeta> now, the other problem may come into play if it's not set to autoupdate its display when those template options are changed
[09:08:05] <Velveeta> and of course it's not :D
[09:08:16] <Velveeta> so you have 2 options from that point
[09:08:38] <Velveeta> one is to hack your way into the prototype and call the method that does that directly, the other is to destroy and recreate the widget with the new options
[09:09:30] <oste> youch
[09:09:43] <Velveeta> both are ugly, but one is slightly less ugly in my opinion
[09:09:43] <oste> ya just noticing that changing the "display" option is not working
[09:09:52] <oste> which one is your choice?
[09:10:05] <Velveeta> i would destroy and recreate personally
[09:10:16] <Velveeta> i think it's cleaner in case there's anything else done as part of the template setup
[09:11:20] <Velveeta> oste: i'll whip you up an example
[09:11:20] <oste> can you provide a starting point for this?
[09:11:24] <oste> SWEET!
[09:11:25] <Velveeta> yepyep
[09:12:38] <malibu> Velveeta: So back to that inner div.. how would I refresh it.  I need the equiv of $("#accordion").accordion("refresh")
[09:12:47] <oste> Velveeta - I think this is the direction the author wants us to go
[09:12:48] <oste> https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/createjs/ZK3jmt6Cf2I
[09:12:59] <oste> asked that question 6 months ago
[09:13:42] <Velveeta> oste: looks like he's advocating you patch his code and issue a pull request, and then download the latest version
[09:13:51] <Velveeta> you might want to do that in parallel, but for now this should get you working
[09:14:09] <oste> haha, guess i did not know what a patch would be
[09:14:29] <oste> i thought he would want me to create the toolbar I speak of
[09:15:37] <shoky> herr raj?
[09:15:55] <Velveeta> oste: here you go: http://pastebin.com/jqU06QVa
[09:16:44] <Velveeta> malibu: let me take a look at its refresh method and see what it's doing
[09:17:15] <malibu> Velveeta: you are most gracious.
[09:17:28] <shoky> raj didn't you say you like this one? (as i do)  http://web.archive.org/web/20130502100718/http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[09:17:57] <malibu> Velveeta: It's probably just something like $("#mydiv").refresh()
[09:18:00] <oste> Velveeta - that does it
[09:18:04] <oste> thanks a alot
[09:18:12] <Velveeta> woo hoo! no problem :)
[09:18:22] <oste> does look kinda dirty hehe
[09:18:37] <malibu> Google brings up a lot of refreshing in an ajax kind of way
[09:19:17] <oste> would love to offer a fix - still not really sure what the best thing is :(
[09:20:29] <Velveeta> oste: you would have to rewrite a portion of the midgardCreate widget to accept an option or options to be passed on to toolbar when it creates it
[09:20:57] <oste> ya - that is what I was thinking
[09:21:02] <oste> more options...
[09:21:11] <Velveeta> malibu: so there's a lot of stuff going on in its refresh and _refresh methods, how about you describe to me what you need that inner div to do and i'll see what i can figure out :)
[09:21:56] <malibu> Velveeta: You've been very kind, but I think I am going to just try to set the hight manually via calculations
[09:21:57] <Velveeta> oste: so i *believe* jquery ui allows for you to embed data attributes in the node itself for use in the widgets also, i'm just not sure how you'd embed a nested option name like that
[09:22:05] <malibu> height
[09:22:13] <Velveeta> malibu: alrighty then, good luck :)
[09:23:00] <oste> i see - does seem like we are asking a lot. Create the widget and then change it...
[09:23:10] <oste> thinking the destroy and recreate is a good way to go...
[09:23:23] <oste> don't think the end user will mind ;)
[09:23:32] <Velveeta> does it flicker when it happens?
[09:23:49] <oste> i dont notice a flicker...
[09:23:58] <Velveeta> then they shouldn't either ;)
[09:24:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> morning Velveeta
[09:24:42] <Velveeta> hello hello :)
[09:26:08] <raj> ohh, didn't see you reply shoky
[09:26:36] <Velveeta> whoa, i didn't eitherâ€¦ a ninja, that one is
[09:27:02] <raj> so question #1) `var methods` should be defined outside the plugin $.fn.tooltip
[09:31:02] <raj> 2) do I need to unbind events that bind to elements that are removed from the DOM?
[09:32:50] <shoky> raj: 1) yes. or was there a question?   2) nope
[09:33:19] <semanty> Velveeta: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6389200/
[09:33:43] <semanty> Velveeta: could you help me check if it is right wirtten? i notice firefox is ok, but ie fails
[09:34:33] <Velveeta> how does ie fail?
[09:34:34] <raj> shoky, for example, I am currently doing this--> http://jsfiddle.net/B35VM/
[09:34:56] <raj> but you're saying all the `vars` that I've defined should be outside $.fn.makeTabs?
[09:35:55] <semanty> Velveeta: the wrapper can not cover fully
[09:36:04] <shoky> raj no i didn't say that
[09:36:10] <semanty> Velveeta:  do you have a paste website for picture?
[09:36:31] <Velveeta> semanty: you can use imgur.com
[09:38:29] <shoky> raj: the "var methods" is a static "global" list of methods that each plugin instance of yours can use
[09:38:51] <shoky> raj: the vars you're defining here are clearly not "global", they are per-instance
[09:39:18] <raj> the static global ones won't be accessible by any other jquery plugin though, right?
[09:39:43] <shoky> nope, not if surrounded by the IIFE
[09:40:30] <raj> k
[09:40:33] <shoky> they're only "global" to the scope of that IIFE
[09:40:51] <semanty> Velveeta: http://imgur.com/YyOoQ5s
[09:40:53] <shoky> well, or however yoou wanna put it.
[09:40:56] <raj> why does it matter whether it's per instance of global?
[09:40:59] <semanty> Velveeta: this is the firefox one
[09:41:07] <Velveeta> got it
[09:41:08] <raj> *or
[09:41:48] <shoky> raj: for the methods, it'd prolly work if you re-created them per each instnace. but that's a waste. and might have repercussions im not thinking of yet
[09:42:00] <semanty> Velveeta: http://imgur.com/6QxcRSr
[09:42:07] <semanty> Velveeta: this is IE one
[09:42:08] <raj> ok
[09:42:09] <Velveeta> the biggest repercussion being memory usage
[09:42:22] <shoky> raj: and the other way round (making these $container etc vars global) definitely won't do, as you don't have a "this" outside the .fn.plugin method
[09:42:32] <semanty> Velveeta: you can find that the button is away
[09:42:36] <raj> so does this mean if I instantiate it on one DOM element, the next time I instantiate it on another DOM element, it won't have to redefine the methods?
[09:42:48] <shoky> yeah
[09:42:56] <raj> k, cool
[09:43:17] <Velveeta> just to throw this back out there againâ€¦. a "plugin" of that nature is perfectly suited to the jquery ui widget factory
[09:43:36] <Velveeta> semanty: right, let me take another look at the code real quick, one minute
[09:43:36] <raj> what does return methods.init.apply( this, arguments );
[09:43:38] <raj> do?
[09:43:40] <shoky> yea raj i agree with Velveeta, in case you don't mind a jquery-ui dependency
[09:43:55] <malibu> Velveeta: Is it possible that the function bound to window refresh might fire too early with firefox on linux?
[09:43:59] <Velveeta> you can always load just the core file that defines the factory if you're worried about bloat
[09:44:02] <raj> I'd rather leave jqui out of this
[09:44:08] <shoky> tru
[09:44:10] <raj> since there's no other use of UI in this situation
[09:44:21] <malibu> Velveeta: The window does do a kind of smooth minimize/maximize
[09:44:24] <raj> thanks though Velveeta
[09:44:54] <malibu> Velveeta: Never mind... I've printed the height it is working with and it is correct.  Ugh
[09:46:11] <Velveeta> semanty: damn, my scrollback buffer *just* lost your old jsfiddle link, do you still have it available?
[09:46:18] <Velveeta> i wanna take a look at your css for a minute
[09:46:39] <Velveeta> malibu: so the height is technically correct, but something isn't appearing correct nonetheless?
[09:47:01] <shoky> raj: methods.init.apply( this, arguments )   calls the init function, setting the context for the call (the value of "this") to the current "this", and passing the individual arguments in "arguments"
[09:47:06] <semanty> Velveeta: i just delete the history and cookie, did you provide the website again>
[09:48:03] <shoky> raj: they wanted to call the init method with the right context and arguments. if you don't know .apply you should read about it (on MDN)
[09:48:06] <malibu> Here is my problem now.  When I first draw my page, everything is perfect.  When I reduce the size of the window the inner accordion is too short.  When I maximize again to the way it was before, the accordion is still too short.  I refresh and everyrhing is fine again.  Even though the height value of the window is the same and the function to calculate the position of everything is the same.
[09:48:18] <Velveeta> semanty: jsfiddle.com?
[09:48:24] <semanty> yes
[09:48:56] <malibu> Sometimes I wish I could just settle for imperfection.  :-)
[09:49:01] <Velveeta> heheheh
[09:49:39] <Velveeta> malibu: and do you have your own resize hanbdler bound for sizing that inner div?
[09:50:04] <raj> ay ay
[09:50:25] <shoky> raj: so basically it's calling methods.init(arg1,arg2,...);   where arg1,arg2,.. are the individual items in "arguments". and also it's copying the current "this" so it will be the same during the function call
[09:50:53] <malibu> Well the resize handler points to a function that calculates sizes, refreshes the outer accordion, sets the height of the div container for the inner, and then refreshes the inner.
[09:51:03] <Velveeta> gotcha
[09:51:12] <Velveeta> it just doesn't seem to actually be working right?
[09:52:12] <malibu> no.. Because although it uses this same function with the same numbers the inner accordion is too short.  Either it is not obeying the height of the container div, or the container div height is off.
[09:52:39] <malibu> I think I'm going to try printing the exact height of the container div to the console.  Something must not be getting set right
[09:52:48] <semanty> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/KQRVz/2/
[09:53:08] <Velveeta> malibu: that's what i was gonna advise, either logging those numbers or stepping through it
[09:53:19] <malibu> I can step through?  How?
[09:53:22] <raj> shoky, where did the arguments var come from?
[09:54:03] <shoky> raj: inside every function call there's an implicit arguments var, containing the arguments passed to the function call
[09:54:12] <raj> oh
[09:54:15] <shoky> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments
[09:54:19] <Velveeta> semanty: and you want the full form to be shown right?
[09:54:25] <raj> interesting
[09:54:26] <semanty> Velveeta: yes
[09:54:40] <semanty> as the firefox photo shows
[09:54:42] <raj> my editor doesn't highlight that syntax
[09:54:52] <semanty> Velveeta: the firefox shows is what i want
[09:54:56] <Velveeta> semanty: why not just remove the 'height' property from your css? a div by default will automatically stretch in height to fit all of its contents
[09:55:02] <shoky> raj: but it's not a real array or someshit, so many times you'll see calls to Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)  to turn it into a proper array
[09:55:26] <semanty> Velveeta: you mean the height: 300px?
[09:55:30] <Velveeta> yep
[09:55:53] <raj> ahh, very interesting
[09:56:04] <malibu> Let me ask this.  If I set   ('#mydiv').height(200).. that will always take effect immediately right?
[09:56:16] <raj> shoky, so besides [0] [1] etc to get the correct argument, it doesn't work as an array?
[09:56:19] <Velveeta> shoky: if i remember correctly, it's not even a real plain object either right? it's some kind of special object type
[09:56:27] <semanty> Velveeta: it is not useful
[09:56:31] <Velveeta> malibu: i believe so, yes
[09:56:37] <malibu> likewise for $("#mydiv").css('height','200px')
[09:56:42] <semanty> Velveeta: delete or not has no impact
[09:56:59] <Velveeta> semanty: are you still setting the height in javascript?
[09:57:06] <shoky> Velveeta: hmm donno
[09:57:18] <semanty> Velveeta: yes, i use jquery height()
[09:57:25] <Velveeta> semanty: get rid of those lines also
[09:57:45] <RonWhoCares> The jQuery    $("#local_time_display_container").val('No Time Zone Selected');   has had no effect on  <div id="local_time_display_container"></div>   Can anyone see why?
[09:57:55] <shoky> raj: pretty much yeah
[09:58:11] <Velveeta> ronwhocares: because a div doesn't have a value to set with the .val() function, try .text() instead
[09:58:41] <malibu> Velveeta: So how do I step through jquery?
[09:59:23] <semanty> Velveeta: is seems ok, i remember i ever failed through this way
[09:59:33] <Velveeta> malibu: just drop a breakpoint in the browser in your function that sets those heights
[10:00:16] <malibu> Velveeta: ah.. didn't realize firebug could do that
[10:00:24] <Velveeta> yepyep
[10:00:29] <RonWhoCares> Velveeta: Thank you --- this worked.
[10:00:44] <Velveeta> ronwhocares: no problem
[10:01:04] <RonWhoCares> My second question:  I am not sure why   $("#change_my_timezone").removeAttr('disabled');   did not disable this button    <button id="change_my_timezone">Change My Time Zone</button>
[10:01:49] <Velveeta> ronwhocares: if you want to disable it, you don't want to remove the disabled attribute, you want to set it, but you should use .prop instead of .attrâ€¦ $('#change_my_timezone').prop('disabled', true);
[10:02:45] <RonWhoCares> Velveeta: Can I change it to "enabled" in another jQuery ?
[10:03:00] <Velveeta> nope, to re-enable it, you'd do .prop('disabled', false)
[10:03:12] <RonWhoCares> ah
[10:03:14] <RonWhoCares> Thank you
[10:03:18] <Velveeta> you're welcome
[10:03:19] <raj> thank you shoky, thank you very much
[10:03:38] <RonWhoCares> That is so cool
[10:03:40] <shoky> ;p
[10:04:52] <Velveeta> so i'm watching that movie "the heat" w/ sandra bullock and melissa mccarthyâ€¦ hilarity
[10:06:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[10:07:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> its a good movie
[10:07:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: have you heard about somethign called phonegap
[10:07:22] <Velveeta> yepyep
[10:07:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay then have you heard about something called steroidsjs
[10:07:42] <Velveeta> i saw sandra bullock in a pizza place here a few years ago when she was still w/ jessie jamesâ€¦ she was in sweatpants and a tshirtâ€¦. and she was still smoking hot
[10:07:57] <Velveeta> i haven't heard of steroidsjs, let me take a look
[10:07:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[10:08:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> she still is
[10:08:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: http://www.appgyver.com/steroids
[10:08:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> its so fricken cool
[10:08:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> and I have discovered somethign even cooler
[10:08:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> good thing about steroids js is that it bridges the performance gap between phoengap and native apps (phonegap is quite slow)
[10:09:16] <Velveeta> nice
[10:09:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways i have discovered a way to get a native look and feel using non-native components too create a native like apps
[10:09:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://chocolatechip-ui.com/
[10:10:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> so i sue steroids and ^ that front end framework, and i have found some amazing results
[10:10:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> really cool stuf
[10:10:34] <Velveeta> oh yeah, one of our devs pointed out chocolate chip about a month ago, i never looked into it too in depth
[10:10:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> its fuckign amazing
[10:10:55] <Velveeta> he's a big mobile-first guy, i'm more of a mobile-maybe guy
[10:11:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[10:11:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> i myself
[10:11:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> am not mobile first
[10:11:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> but this hybrid app thing i am embracing
[10:11:27] <Velveeta> fortunately, he's coming onto my team in january, so i don't have to worry about that stuff, he'll take it over for me :)
[10:11:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[10:11:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> you have a team?
[10:11:51] <Velveeta> well when i say mobile-first, i don't mean native, i just mean performant web apps in a mobile form factor
[10:11:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> work for some sort of company
[10:12:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhhhh
[10:12:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> when i thought you meant mobile first
[10:12:11] <Velveeta> yes, i work for the advisory board, on our platform team, as the front end architect
[10:12:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> as in fuck desktop .....we care about mobile primarily
[10:12:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> front end architect
[10:12:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol what a name
[10:12:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> XD
[10:12:38] <Velveeta> nope, as in designing for mobile environments first, and then scaling it up to desktop
[10:12:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya thats what i was gonna say
[10:12:53] <Velveeta> i know, sounds important huh ;)
[10:12:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> i hate that approach
[10:13:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> i still think that desktop is still primary
[10:13:09] <Velveeta> definitely
[10:13:34] <Velveeta> i'm starting the embrace the philosophy of desktop first, mobile as simultaneously as possible
[10:13:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> i just call myself  a frontend ("who-knows-some-stuff-about-back-end) devloper
[10:13:53] <Velveeta> i'm gonna be implementing multi-template support in our own widgets to determine their container space, similar to element queries
[10:13:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> well here is the thing
[10:14:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> with hybrid apps becoming as good as native appsI think we might start to see a shift
[10:14:11] <malibu> Velveeta: So.. When I reload the page, the inner-accordian div height somehow ends up '0'.  When I resize the window, it gets set to a hard value.  So apparently it is getting initialized wrong, as it should get a height.
[10:14:22] <Velveeta> yeah i come from a full stack dev background, so i have no problems injecting my opinion on server-side architecture or db stuff, but i specialize in the client now
[10:15:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: i am fronte dn purely, its just stuff is changing so fast that a front end guy cant be purely front end anymore, the lines between front end and backend are quickly bluring
[10:15:12] <Velveeta> malibu: well if it's a hidden div, it'll automatically return 0 for its height
[10:15:43] <malibu> Velveeta: Ah.
[10:19:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> malibu: you can probably get the hieght property
[10:19:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> .css("height");
[10:19:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: so what sort of projects do you guys do
[10:19:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> your tema that is
[10:19:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> *team
[10:21:44] <malibu> Rohan_Bhangui: Velveeta: Yes I have now.  I expanded it and got the height.  So when my page reloads, the inner accordion is not obeying the height of its parent div.  The parent div is 420px and the inner accordion is 447.
[10:22:06] <Velveeta> malibu: are you using a css reset file of some kind?
[10:22:14] <Velveeta> sounds like there may be some native padding being applied or something
[10:22:14] <malibu> Velveeta: no
[10:23:05] <malibu> Velveeta: Important to not that, after window resize and the same function triggers, the inner accordion starts to obey its container div.
[10:23:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> malibu: whcih hieght do you want to remain the way it is right now the praetn or accordion
[10:23:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> if accordion
[10:23:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> parent{
[10:23:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> float: left;
[10:23:08] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: as platform, we make products that our actual client-facing products consume as part of their workflow, so like our style guide, synonymous with something like bootstrap, our internal widget library, our common authentication module for all products to use, etc
[10:23:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: is that of the company brochure :P ?
[10:23:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> i kidna understand it but not fully
[10:24:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> malibu: set those things your doig on resize
[10:24:24] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: the company itself is healthcare consulting, so our products are tailored for the medical industry, either towards physicians themselves, or hospital facilitators, or insurance bean counters or marketing people, etc
[10:24:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> use them in the .on("load"
[10:24:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> that makes more sense
[10:24:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> XD was that so hard?
[10:25:01] <Velveeta> well you asked about my team specifically ;)
[10:25:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[10:26:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> i thought you were some sort of media consulting company or somethign
[10:26:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> rarely does a tea/company that does media stuff have such a specifc focus
[10:26:31] <Velveeta> nope, healthcare consulting firm, and we're just starting to branch into education also i think
[10:31:15] <malibu> how woudl I print div heights to the console every time I alter the accordion?
[10:32:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: education?
[10:32:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> what sort of plans do you have
[10:32:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> (im curious)
[10:32:19] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: high school dropout
[10:32:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> care to elaborate
[10:32:46] <Velveeta> but then i got my ged and went to that pinnacle of colleges, ITT
[10:32:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> malibu: do it on window.resize
[10:33:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> nice
[10:33:10] <Velveeta> malibu: yeah, whatever callback you're calling on window resize, just add your console log statements there
[10:33:16] <malibu> I am, but I need to capture the height of the div inside my accordion after I expand that section
[10:33:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> what sorts of interests would your company have in education
[10:33:26] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: but that had nothing to do with my programming background, i went there for network administration :D
[10:33:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhhh
[10:33:35] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: ohhhhhhhhhhh
[10:33:41] <Velveeta> i thought you were asking my own education :D
[10:33:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> no no
[10:33:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry
[10:34:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> you said "we're just starting to branch into education also i think"
[10:34:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> tahts why i asked
[10:34:15] <Velveeta> so their business is a lot of providing data metrics
[10:34:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> but good to knwo how you were educated ;)
[10:34:20] <Velveeta> be it healthcare, or now, education
[10:34:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry not familar with all terminology
[10:34:36] <Velveeta> they harvest craptons of data and spit it back to users in the form of consumable information
[10:34:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> data metrics?
[10:34:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhhh
[10:34:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> analytics
[10:34:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> almost
[10:35:16] <Velveeta> yep, so for healthcare, they might show you a metric for like, for physician A, what was the average length of stay for their cardiac patients specifically, for the month of february
[10:35:19] <Velveeta> that sort of thing
[10:35:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> malibu: is there any way by which your able to capture a .on("change"
[10:35:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> malibu: are you using plugin for accordion
[10:35:58] <Velveeta> and now i suppose they want to do something similar in education, maybe showing which teachers' students do better on certain tests, or in certain subjects, by geographic location, by school, by race, by whatever
[10:36:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> i guess those analytics would be usefull
[10:36:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> in carefully allocating resoruces
[10:36:33] <malibu> I'm using the native jquery-ui accordion
[10:36:37] <Velveeta> well not just in that, but in spreading best practices
[10:36:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[10:36:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> but not neccessarily
[10:36:57] <norbi> hi guys, im havin a small issue with uploadify, after loading the page using uploadify it sends a get request at the end to the document root, i have session_regenerate_id(true) with php and recalling the root dir will regenerate the session id, so ajax is messed up, do you have any ideea why uplodify sends a get request for the root dir? ill paste an image of what im talking about
[10:37:00] <Velveeta> if one person does things extremely well and someone else is floundering in that category, examine what they're doing differently
[10:37:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> will one rpactice apply for another area
[10:37:15] <Velveeta> not for another area, but for similar disciplines
[10:37:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> i guess
[10:37:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> malibu: jquery-ui accordion should have some exposed events
[10:37:47] <Velveeta> if you have 2 cardiac docs who have similar patient types, and one has an average readmission rate of 70% and the other is like 5%, obviously one is doing something differently than the other
[10:38:10] <Velveeta> whether it's a more thorough examination, or running a different set of tests that might catch something the other is missing, or whatever
[10:38:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[10:38:32] <malibu> Ok well all the heights seem the same
[10:38:36] <malibu> internally
[10:38:42] <malibu> Yet it is not getting drawn the same
[10:38:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> malibu: rea dthe documentation
[10:38:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> there are events avaible
[10:38:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/
[10:39:01] <malibu> Rohan_Bhangui: yeah I will if it comes to that
[10:39:04] <lng> Should `$( '#dialog-form' ).attr('title', 'Change item');` change `<div id="dialog-form" title="Create item">`?
[10:39:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> it should
[10:39:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: why dont you take care of norbi issue
[10:40:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> malibu you should be using then regardles
[10:40:15] <Velveeta> i totally missed it, let me read it real quick
[10:40:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> jquery pluginsare built to expose certain event and methods for this reason alone
[10:40:29] <lng> Rohan_Bhangui: it doesn't work
[10:40:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> creating fiddle
[10:41:05] <Velveeta> norbi: it's been a long time since i touched uploadify, not sure why it would send a get request like that, is there s a public page i can see that in action?
[10:42:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> Ing there is no differnce in your statements
[10:42:19] <norbi> Velveeta: if you download the newest uploadify, and just use it, i mean when you download it it comes with a demo, that demo does like the same thing, ive checked with firebug
[10:42:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> lng: there is no difference in those statenemtns
[10:42:30] <norbi> Velveeta: i have no public page for demonstration
[10:42:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> lng: oh wait nvm
[10:43:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> lng: here you go http://jsfiddle.net/w7H9L/
[10:43:55] <Velveeta> norbi: the demo on their site doesn't do it..
[10:44:05] <Velveeta> let me double check that
[10:44:19] <norbi> Velveeta: here is the image: http://oi42.tinypic.com/2nn51f.jpg
[10:45:05] <lng> Rohan_Bhangui: weird
[10:46:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> lng: lol
[10:46:20] <norbi> Velveeta: and yes it does, if you watch more carefully it sends a GET for /demos/ again and as result it has the full page source
[10:47:22] <lng> Rohan_Bhangui: why?
[10:47:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> lng: elaborate?
[10:47:58] <lng> Rohan_Bhangui: lol
[10:48:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> lng: cause there was really no problem
[10:48:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> XD
[10:49:30] <Velveeta> norbi: hold on, i'm still looking into its source
[10:51:46] <norbi> Velveeta: im also looking but im way too stupid for this..
[10:54:24] <norbi> Velveeta: only thing i found is related to swfupload: c=window.location.protocol+"//"+window.location.hostname+(window.location.port?":"+window.location.port:"");var b=window.location.pathname.lastIndexOf("/");if(b<=0){path="/"}else{path=window.location.pathname.substr(0,b)+"/"}
[10:55:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> brb Velveeta
[10:56:04] <placidb> could somebody please explain to me why window.innerWidth and $(window).width() are returning different values on the latest chrome? i realise that this is in part a chromium-related question, so i apologize if this is too off-topic for this channel. i've googled this for a while though, and have come up with nothing useful so far. any help is appreciated.
[11:01:20] <norbi> Velveeta: it seems a swfupload bug: http://www.uploadify.com/forum/#/discussion/comment/16416
[11:02:10] <Velveeta> yeah i was just looking at the completeurl stuff and trying to figure out where it was being called from
[11:05:35] <norbi> Velveeta: any recomandations <
[11:05:38] <norbi> Velveeta: ?
[11:06:34] <norbi> Velveeta: as i can see its called on button image..
[11:06:45] <raj> shoky, how would I work with the options I've set http://jsfiddle.net/B35VM/1/ ... cuz the directions from that webpage pass `method` to the $.fn.tooltip function
[11:07:00] <raj> and currently, I pass `o`
[11:07:22] <Velveeta> norbi: no recommendations, i don't do anything dealing w/ ajax uploads
[11:08:47] <norbi> Velveeta: i mean, dont you have any recomandation for the solution? changing the completeurl function or?
[11:09:07] <malibu> Velveeta: In the end all the numbers seem the same.  There must be some inherent different in the accordion in the way the panels are calculated, depending on whether the page is drawn or resized
[11:09:36] <Lightsaber> Hello, I am trying to add class in 2 divs. But I can add class only one div, I cant add class another div.My codes:
[11:09:43] <Lightsaber>  $(document).ready(function () {
[11:09:46] <Velveeta> norbi: off the top of my head, no, because i'm not sure where that function's being called from, or by what, so i don't have any recommendations on what to refactor inside of there to make it work better
[11:09:49] <malibu> Velveeta: I made two functions that have the height off by 20px.. one for initialization and one for resize
[11:09:55] <malibu> And it works fine
[11:10:22] <norbi> Velveeta: ok thank you, np, you helped me a lot, tyvm again
[11:10:50] <Lightsaber> my codes: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/6389761/
[11:11:08] <Lightsaber> How can I fix this problem?
[11:11:41] <Velveeta> lightsaber: you're using an id selector, that'll only return 1 element
[11:11:47] <Velveeta> id's are supposed to be unique in the document
[11:13:04] <Lightsaber> There are 2 divs which have this id.
[11:13:42] <Velveeta> that may be, but they're not supposed to
[11:14:22] <Velveeta> id's are supposed to be unique in the document, if you use an id selector, the browser will only return 1 element, the first one it finds with that id
[11:16:21] <Lightsaber> If I use class, will it fix?
[11:16:27] <Velveeta> yep, it should
[11:21:08] <Lightsaber> thanks, velveeta it works well
[11:21:15] <Velveeta> you're welcome

[11:46:19] <sylflo> hi
[11:47:03] <sylflo> http://peronczyk.com/about/
[11:48:13] <sylflo> if I want to do the same transition (http://peronczyk.com/about/). Is my website needs to be in one page ?
[12:31:38] <odium> I am having trouble with a couple functions?
[12:32:28] <grafi> Are you?
[12:32:31] <odium> oops. Can I determine if a css class has been applied already before toggling it, or is there an applyClass function?
[12:33:03] <grafi> do you want to toggle it?
[12:33:24] <grafi> if not addClass should not add a class that is already there if i remember correctly
[12:36:15] <odium> grafi, I prefer to use addClass
[12:36:17] <odium> thank you.
[12:48:12] <zim> Hi all. Can I use .on to catch form submit?? the problem is that .submit() is not bound to new content
[12:49:08] <jedimind> yup
[12:49:44] <zim> jedimind: ty but yup is != to how? :-)
[12:50:00] <jedimind> $('#content').on('submit', 'form', function() { .... });
[12:50:06] <jedimind> assuming #content is the container your form will eventually live in
[12:50:10] <zim> TY many thanks
[12:50:16] <jedimind> form can also be any selector if its a specific form
[12:53:28] <zim> jedimind: TY yes I have it looking for .ajaxForm
[12:54:38] <zim> when suing .post do I have to .serialize() or can I just point it at the form?

[13:16:22] <grafi> for php
[13:53:16] <oal> Any idea why .on('keyup', ...) doesn't work on Android?
[14:03:42] <frothnicator> To allow CanJS to clean up certain UI elements, I find myself needing to use the idiom: $('#SomeId').replaceWith( $('<div>', {id: 'SomeId'} ));  Is there a canonical way to replace an element with an empty clone of itself, like this?
[14:03:50] <frothnicator> Specifically, .clone() would appear to not work as it also copies data, which I do not want.
[14:22:58] <hirsty> hi is anyone eny good with the leanModal?
[14:43:24] <Cache_Money> I have a div with text inside.  When I hover over it the cursor changes, I'd rather keep the pointer as the cursor.  How do I do this?
[14:44:45] <frothnicator> Cache_Money: that is a CSS question, not jQuery.  Hint: 'cursor: ...'
[14:47:10] <Cache_Money> frothnicator: got it, thanks
[14:54:02] <lans> hello guys. I have some HTML in string. I created an object from that string: $(html_string) and did some actions with it. Tell me please how can i convert my jQuery object to html to append it to page?
[15:24:06] <Rtransat> Hi
[15:24:44] <Rtransat> How can I call ajaxSuccess and ready in same time ? http://pastie.org/8468730
[15:25:16] <Rtransat> it's for a WordPress widget (back office)
[15:25:31] <Rtransat> http://www.techiecorner.com/2750/wordpress-add-javascript-event-after-widget-save/
[15:59:37] <frothnicator> lans: don't do it yourself.  Let jQuery do it: $('#someId').html( html_string ) or $('some selector').append( $(html_string) ).  There are lots more ways than just those two, but that should get you going.
[16:00:16] <lans> frothnicator: okay thanks
[16:30:53] <coldhead> it was sad when artax died
[16:31:09] <grafi> coldhead you monster
[16:31:14] <grafi> it was sad :(
[16:46:49] <oste> hey Velveeta - turns out the solution we came up with is no good http://pastebin.com/jqU06QVa
[16:47:10] <oste> it actually just adds a second create-ui-toolbar element to the page rather than modifying the current one
[16:51:57] <EGreg> hey guys
[16:52:01] <EGreg> what's the point of isPlainObject
[16:52:07] <EGreg> why can't I just do x.constructor === Object
[16:56:52] <coldhead> you CAN just do that, EGreg
[16:57:33] <coldhead> i dimly remember that there are certain objects provided by some browsers which will lie to you when you do that comparison
[16:57:40] <coldhead> but it never actually matters to me
[16:57:47] <coldhead> isPlainObject is more readable anyway
[16:57:54] <coldhead> i feel icky when i compare constructors
[17:02:42] <EGreg> I wrote my own isPlainObject for my framework
[17:02:45] <EGreg> it's slightly diff and less verbose
[17:03:01] <EGreg> Feel free to use it for jquery:
[17:03:11] <EGreg> http://pastie.org/private/u3f4whxht25liphirxc2gq
[17:04:28] <EGreg> it does however fail for objects who specifically set .constructor = "lied"
[17:04:31] <EGreg> in IE8
[17:10:03] <coldhead> the time when i will need to determine the plainness of an object is hopefully many years from now :)
[17:11:05] <EGreg> lol
[17:11:14] <EGreg> it's plain as the nose on someone's ? nevermind :)
[17:15:26] <oste> Velveeta - ended up doing this something like the accepted answer here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2287045/override-jqueryui-dialog-default-options
[17:26:03] <raj> hey coldhead
[17:26:21] <raj> tengo una pregunta

[17:26:45] <coldhead> no tiende
[17:26:54] <raj> no *entiende
[17:28:29] <raj> coldhead, I'm trying to figure out how to access `this` within `init`
[17:28:29] <raj> 20:26 < coldhead> no tiende
[17:28:34] <raj> wtf
[17:28:38] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/B35VM/2/
[17:35:12] <coldhead> this is way more than i know about jquery, raj
[17:35:17] <coldhead> it seems to be working
[17:36:39] <coldhead> oh except i think you have o/options scoped wrong
[17:36:45] <coldhead> you might want more like http://jsfiddle.net/B35VM/3/
[17:36:53] <coldhead> and put options in the closure
[17:40:04] <raj> you just declared `options` outside `init`?
[17:40:43] <coldhead> yes
[17:40:49] <coldhead> so it could persist
[17:40:53] <coldhead> oh you're right
[17:41:09] <coldhead> it's being shadowed now by the init(options) definition
[17:41:13] <coldhead> you'll have to rename one
[17:41:54] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/B35VM/4/
[17:41:57] <coldhead> lie dat
[17:42:30] <shoky> me don't like
[17:43:12] <shoky> should have a global defaults var maybe, not options
[17:44:02] <coldhead> it's my first day using jquery
[17:44:07] <coldhead> i have no idea what i'm doing
[17:44:12] <coldhead> i just wanted to be popular
[17:44:29] <coldhead> i haven't written any actual code since the 1980s
[17:44:34] <coldhead> before any of you were born
[17:45:30] <shoky> think i coded a bit in the 80s too
[17:45:51] <shoky> qbasic <3
[17:57:56] <raj> lol
[18:37:38] <B|aster> hey can anyone tell me why this returns JSON.parse: unexpected character  https://gist.github.com/redstar504/7392992.
[18:38:47] <B|aster> nevermkind
[18:39:02] <B|aster> I think it needed quotes
[18:43:54] <oste> are events triggered when a jQuery UI _create method is finished?
[18:46:57] <oste> looks like you can pass create: function(){ as an option
[19:16:04] <JavierCabrera> hello
[19:16:32] <JavierCabrera> someone knows why this isn't working? http://www.advgenie.com/
[19:23:29] <shoky> JavierCabrera: working for me
[19:24:00] <JavierCabrera> yep but if you write something, and drag a txt file on it, it doesn't load the txt file anymore
[19:24:17] <JavierCabrera> the drag/drop only works if you haven't written on the textarea
[19:24:23] <JavierCabrera> can't get my head around it
[19:24:27] <shoky> what textarea
[19:24:27] <JavierCabrera> its out of my league
[19:24:33] <shoky> oh
[19:25:40] <JavierCabrera> the drag/drop isn't quite working
[19:25:58] <JavierCabrera> the LOAD FILE WITH UPLOADER was working but I really don't want that, I wanted to upgrade to drag/drop
[19:26:19] <JavierCabrera> but I think I went out of my general league there ;-D
[19:27:43] <JavierCabrera> solved it
[19:27:55] <JavierCabrera> changed  holder.innerText = event.target.result; to  holder.value = event.target.result;
[19:27:58] <JavierCabrera> in case someone wonders ;-D
[19:28:09] <JavierCabrera> okay! back to work. Thanks anyway.
[20:13:37] <Mrgoose> sup sup, in jquery mobile is it possible scroll a side panel indepently
[20:18:39] <JoseffB> hey all
[20:18:50] <JoseffB> anyone know easelJS? seems their room is empty
[22:02:51] <LckyBy517> looking at the documentation and i still haven't figured out soemthing. the .html() method, does it remove items from the DOM that were there when you set new content in it?
[22:03:19] <LckyBy517> or should i call .empty() first?
[22:07:23] <pixelpimp> it'll rewrite everything inside, so no need to empty first
[22:08:26] <LckyBy517> ok, reason i ask is i notice that my DOM keeps filling up with images everytime an ajax script executes, its not emptying the items out of DOM so its causing problems :(
[22:16:38] <pixelpimp> LckyBy517: interesting.  any chance you could recreate that in jsfiddle?
[22:17:02] <pixelpimp> i imagine looking at a live version might be a bit more difficult to debug, but i'll take a look at that too
[22:19:48] <LckyBy517> yeah let me try doing it on jsfiddle
[22:20:23] <Velveeta> me too
[22:26:49] <LckyBy517> http://jsfiddle.net/VbUCL/ not really sure why i can't get the output to display but its my first time using jsfiddle as well haa
[22:27:58] <Velveeta> jsfiddle doesn't like actually making ajax requests, unfortunately
[22:28:12] <LckyBy517> oh dang
[22:28:25] <Velveeta> so what's the actual end goal here that you're having problems with?
[22:28:43] <frothnicator> To allow CanJS to clean up certain UI elements, I find myself needing to use the idiom: $('#SomeId').replaceWith( $('<div>', {id: 'SomeId'} ));  Is there a canonical way to replace an element with an empty clone of itself, like this?
[22:28:56] <frothnicator> Specifically, .clone() would appear to not work as it also copies data, which I do not want.
[22:29:07] <LckyBy517> where i push the data to the html element, the images generated by the php script keep getting added to the DOM
[22:29:33] <Velveeta> so you should be able to clone without cloning the data, cloning with data is an option of the clone function
[22:29:35] <LckyBy517> and seeing as that script runs every 15 seconds and its loading an image per every item in the array its filling the DOM quickly with a bunch of crap thats not relevant for more than 15 seconds
[22:32:19] <Velveeta> hold on just a minute, and i'll take a look into this, distracted by something on mythbusters for a minute :)
[22:35:09] <Velveeta> ok, one thing i see right off the bat as a problem is your getPlayers function
[22:35:27] <Velveeta> you're returning $.ajax(â€¦).responseText;
[22:35:43] <Velveeta> what version of jquery are you running?
[22:35:53] <Velveeta> because the async: false option was deprecated a while back
[22:42:47] <LckyBy517> i'm planning on rewriting that part
[22:43:08] <LckyBy517> but i'm running 2.0.3
[22:43:27] <Velveeta> ok, then that should just return a jquery promise object, not your response text
[22:43:53] <LckyBy517> it returns the text
[22:44:04] <LckyBy517> its iplemented into the site and working
[22:44:07] <Velveeta> weird, that behavior should be deprecated by that point
[22:44:14] <Velveeta> ok, let me look at the rest
[22:44:43] <LckyBy517> like i said it just keeps inserting into the DOM, i even added the .empty() just to see and its still adding and not removing anything
[22:44:55] <Velveeta> ok, so i see where you're looping through the player array and re-requesting every 15 seconds
[22:45:13] <Velveeta> so what are you wanting it to replace?
[22:45:23] <LckyBy517> someone recommended long polling so i'm gonna attempt that soon
[22:45:43] <LckyBy517> basically i just want the div online_players wiped clean and then the new data inserted
[22:46:12] <Velveeta> and you say it's just adding to it every 15 seconds? not replacing it every 15 seconds?
[22:46:14] <LckyBy517> unless i'm interpreting the chrome developer tools wrong i htink the DOM elements for the img's are being retained each time even though i'm clearing it
[22:46:49] <LckyBy517> no the old data is being removed from the list, but i'm still seeing the images in the DOM like they are still loaded, or is that normal behavior?
[22:47:34] <Velveeta> well, i see images in the html string you're insertingâ€¦ are you talking about some other images? or are you saying that for each iteration, you're seeing 15 extra images in the dom?
[22:47:52] <Velveeta> so at 15, 30, 45, 60 seconds, etc, you're seeing 15, 30, 45, 60 images
[22:48:07] <LckyBy517> http://mc.gnd-tech.com
[22:48:27] <LckyBy517> if you watch the online players bar at the right you notice its only showing them as it should
[22:48:38] <Velveeta> yeah i see 3 right now
[22:48:50] <Velveeta> 3/50
[22:48:57] <LckyBy517> buty ifyou use chrome developer tools in the resources section its showing the images being added each time to the resources
[22:49:10] <Velveeta> ok let me take a look at that
[22:49:45] <LckyBy517> wait 15 seconds and you will see all new skins.php image files listed there, in multiples of however many people are online each time
[22:49:57] <LckyBy517> thats where i'm stumped and if thats expected behavior and i'm just a noob or what hehe
[22:49:58] <Velveeta> yep, i'm looking at it on the network tab too
[22:50:06] <Velveeta> and the headers show no-cache on the cache-control header
[22:50:13] <Velveeta> do you have caching disabled for those?
[22:50:21] <LckyBy517> i never did anything for cachin
[22:50:28] <LckyBy517> i could add that to the headers i guess hehe
[22:50:55] <Velveeta> make sure your web server, whatever it is, isn't set to auto-send a no-cache header
[22:51:09] <Velveeta> at that point, it may request the same images over and over, but it should pull them from the cache
[22:56:21] <LckyBy517> i set it to public and still seeing them show up each time
[23:06:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta:
[23:06:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> you still up
[23:15:32] <CQ> if I want to write an app for offline use (i.e. a simple todo list manager) that would work cross-platform (android, ios, linux, windows), woudl jquery(mobile) work, or what else would I need to be able to make application packages for android and ios?
[23:25:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> ah
[23:25:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> CQ
[23:25:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> your in luck
[23:25:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> im working on hyrid apps myself
[23:25:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> CQ: take a look at something called phonegap and jqtouch
[23:25:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> both together offer some great stuff
[23:25:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> for web apps
[23:26:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> that have a native wrapper and so can be published to ios android app stores
[23:28:27] <pixelpimp> your enter key appears to be sticking
[23:29:41] <javalover> is it faster to load a page using .replace() & a string of javascript,  or to use .load() on a pre written html page?
[23:29:47] <CQ> I've seen phonegap, haven't looked at jqtouch yet, thanks
[23:30:36] <javalover> oh and to add to it, a function would be used to create the string first.   Whereas with the html page the string would just be written in html.
[23:30:54] <pixelpimp> phonegap is great.  
[23:31:02] <CQ> I lookes at sencha, but that seems to work only with webkit ant not work well on desktops
[23:31:37] <pixelpimp> javalover: neither is necessarily faster; one generates content on the client, one loads from the server.  either could be slow or fast.
[23:31:49] <CQ> s/lookes/lookes && s/ant/and ... typing not working well this morning ; )
[23:32:05] <javalover> which would you recommend doing?
[23:32:15] <pixelpimp> whichever makes the most sense.
[23:32:27] <javalover> well each time they do it, they're loading external content
[23:32:36] <javalover> so perhaps the .load is just better in principle
[23:32:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay CQ
[23:32:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> you listening?
[23:32:51] <pixelpimp> it's your app, i couldn't even remotely tell you
[23:32:53] <javalover> but the other method would be .load() // grabs external content  gives to javascript
[23:33:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> ill give you my secret sauce though its not perfect
[23:33:04] <javalover> but considering that much it's probably better just to send back everything
[23:33:10] <pixelpimp> if you're loading from multiple sources, it might be better to do it in that function
[23:33:28] <javalover> well it's 1 source at a time
[23:33:39] <javalover> but I see what you're saying about the multiples
[23:33:58] <javalover> idk my current feed that I use has the .load & php sends back a string of html.
[23:34:13] <javalover> but I have this old function that used javascript & as I was converting it I was like "is this worth my time?"
